00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:49,888
She's gonna come in second,

176
00:13:49,921 --> 00:13:54,459
so what I'm thinking,
is you bet at the show, huh?

177
00:13:54,493 --> 00:13:55,794
And it's a sure thing!

178
00:13:55,827 --> 00:13:58,463
Don't mess me up on this one,
Uncle Vito.

179
00:13:58,497 --> 00:14:00,699
I need this one now!

180
00:14:00,732 --> 00:14:03,970
Look, I don't know what you're
talking about, now listen.

181
00:14:04,003 --> 00:14:09,541
Tony boy,
I know you're gonna win. Hm?

182
00:14:15,014 --> 00:14:17,449
[no audible dialogue]

183
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:26,424
Maureen O'Reilly.

184
00:14:27,459 --> 00:14:28,460
Oh...

185
00:14:29,095 --> 00:14:30,695
[phone ringing]

186
00:14:32,831 --> 00:14:36,601
McDougal Enterprises,
meeting all of your driver needs.

187
00:14:36,635 --> 00:14:40,039
This is Doug McDougal,
how may I help you?

188
00:14:40,072 --> 00:14:41,974
It's me, numb nuts.

189
00:14:42,008 --> 00:14:45,343
Why don't you look at
your caller ID, doofus.

190
00:14:45,377 --> 00:14:46,611
Oh, crap!

191
00:14:46,645 --> 00:14:48,014
How'd you
get this number?

192
00:14:53,119 --> 00:14:54,753
Open the door, let's go!

193
00:14:54,786 --> 00:14:56,388
Shush, you little punks!

194
00:14:57,722 --> 00:14:59,891
[Tony] <i>Never mind that.</i>

195
00:14:59,925 --> 00:15:02,794
Uncle Vito gave me
one of his sure things.

196
00:15:02,828 --> 00:15:06,364
Why don't you come on over to The
Pub and meet me there about 4:30.

197
00:15:06,398 --> 00:15:09,135
I can't. I'm at work.

198
00:15:09,168 --> 00:15:12,637
I'm already late,
I'm doing my last drop offs,

199
00:15:12,671 --> 00:15:15,540
and then Christmas vacation
here we come.

200
00:15:15,574 --> 00:15:17,009
[door banging]

201
00:15:17,043 --> 00:15:18,978
Hey, what are you doing dude?
Come on, open up!

202
00:15:19,011 --> 00:15:21,847
- I've got somewhere to be!
- It looks like he's on the phone.

203
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:25,151
Fifteen minutes tops,
you're already running late.

204
00:15:25,184 --> 00:15:27,019
What's another few minutes?

205
00:15:27,053 --> 00:15:32,357
Tony boy, I'm in.
I'll be right there.

206
00:15:38,864 --> 00:15:40,432
All right, you little hooligans,

207
00:15:40,465 --> 00:15:42,101
you're
the last of the Mohicans.

208
00:15:42,134 --> 00:15:48,540
Get in, sit down,
grab on, and pipe down!

209
00:15:48,573 --> 00:15:50,009
It's about time, dude.

210
00:15:51,643 --> 00:15:52,644
[ominous music playing]

211
00:15:52,677 --> 00:15:54,679
Ho, ho, ho.

212
00:15:56,481 --> 00:15:58,850
How are you
on this bright, sunny day?

213
00:15:59,918 --> 00:16:02,554
Sunny day.

214
00:16:02,587 --> 00:16:05,157
You know the routine.

215
00:16:05,191 --> 00:16:09,095
Nobody goes through these doors

216
00:16:09,128 --> 00:16:11,863
without being cleared by me.

217
00:16:11,897 --> 00:16:16,035
Well, uh, actually,
I just dropped by to see Big Freddie.

218
00:16:16,068 --> 00:16:17,802
You remember me, don't cha?

219
00:16:19,205 --> 00:16:21,640
No, can't say I do.

220
00:16:21,673 --> 00:16:26,678
You know, my Uncle Vito.
Mama Rosa's Pizzeria.

221
00:16:26,711 --> 00:16:28,981
My Aunt Rosa and my Uncle Vito.

222
00:16:29,015 --> 00:16:31,150
Him and Freddie go way back.

223
00:16:31,183 --> 00:16:34,753
All right, go on in.

224
00:16:34,786 --> 00:16:37,822
But make it quick.

225
00:16:37,856 --> 00:16:40,558
Big Freddie
has a lot of appointments.

226
00:16:41,493 --> 00:16:42,861
All right, no problem.

227
00:16:44,263 --> 00:16:46,765
[slow paced music playing]

228
00:16:49,768 --> 00:16:51,770
Don't you already owe me, Tony?

229
00:16:52,837 --> 00:16:55,640
Well, uh, I paid you back.

230
00:16:55,674 --> 00:16:57,944
I mean, I'm almost done
paying you back.

231
00:16:57,977 --> 00:17:01,013
You know, but I... I'm trying
to pay you back, yeah.

232
00:17:02,148 --> 00:17:03,748
Oh, yeah, right.

233
00:17:03,782 --> 00:17:08,787
So I am supposed to
be dumb enough

234
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:11,157
to give you more
when you already owe me?

235
00:17:12,691 --> 00:17:14,859
Do I look like a dummy, Tony?

236
00:17:14,893 --> 00:17:17,796
Of course not, Big Freddie.

237
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:20,266
You're the smartest
business man I know.

238
00:17:20,299 --> 00:17:22,634
I kinda look up to you,
you know.

239
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:28,573
Well, if you think
I'm that smart, Tony...

240
00:17:28,606 --> 00:17:31,509
now why do you think
I'm gonna give you more money

241
00:17:31,543 --> 00:17:36,148
when you haven't paid me back the
money that I already gave you?

242
00:17:36,182 --> 00:17:38,750
Now that ain't smart,
is it, Tony?

243
00:17:38,783 --> 00:17:40,518
I was thinking, you know,

244
00:17:40,552 --> 00:17:42,854
I mean, I'm always good for it,
you know that.

245
00:17:44,023 --> 00:17:46,691
Plus, I never said nothing,

246
00:17:46,725 --> 00:17:48,593
I never say nothing
about your fee.

247
00:17:48,626 --> 00:17:51,030
That is true.

248
00:17:51,063 --> 00:17:53,065
You have never stiffed me.

249
00:17:53,099 --> 00:17:54,733
Not yet anyway.

250
00:17:58,170 --> 00:18:00,172
All right,
how much you need now?

251
00:18:00,206 --> 00:18:02,942
- Twenty thou.
- Oh!

252
00:18:06,245 --> 00:18:10,950
You still owe me,
and I'm gonna give you 20 more?

253
00:18:10,983 --> 00:18:13,285
It's a sure thing, Big Freddie.

254
00:18:14,286 --> 00:18:17,289
It's the Annual Christmas Derby.

255
00:18:17,323 --> 00:18:20,925
The purse
is one million big ones.

256
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:23,129
Million?

257
00:18:25,064 --> 00:18:26,898
Sure thing, huh?

258
00:18:27,699 --> 00:18:28,800
Says who?

259
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:30,102
My Uncle Vito.

260
00:18:30,136 --> 00:18:33,772
[laughing]

261
00:18:33,805 --> 00:18:35,640
Uncle Vito.

262
00:18:35,673 --> 00:18:38,010
That loser
wouldn't know a sure thing

263
00:18:38,044 --> 00:18:40,179
if it punched him in the mouth.

264
00:18:40,212 --> 00:18:42,781
Never mind my uncle, okay.

265
00:18:43,815 --> 00:18:45,884
I'm good for it, Freddie.

266
00:18:46,986 --> 00:18:49,654
- You trust me.
- Trust you?

267
00:18:51,623 --> 00:18:53,591
I don't trust nobody.

268
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:55,194
I don't even trust
my own mother.

269
00:18:57,163 --> 00:18:59,597
It's a sure thing this time.

270
00:18:59,631 --> 00:19:00,865
All right.

271
00:19:02,201 --> 00:19:05,337
I'm gonna give you
the 20 large...

272
00:19:05,371 --> 00:19:10,575
you're gonna pay me back,
all of it, by Christmas Eve.

273
00:19:11,277 --> 00:19:14,180
All of it, with my fee.

274
00:19:15,981 --> 00:19:18,317
Or there's gonna be
circumstances.

275
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:21,053
That is a Big Freddie promise.

276
00:19:22,221 --> 00:19:26,058
But-but that's only a week.

277
00:19:26,092 --> 00:19:29,295
Yeah, a week.

278
00:19:29,328 --> 00:19:31,997
You got a problem with
the timeframe there, Tony?

279
00:19:33,399 --> 00:19:37,103
You expecting to lose your shirt
or more of my money?

280
00:19:38,971 --> 00:19:40,772
"Sure thing" you said.

281
00:19:44,143 --> 00:19:45,344
You listen to me,

282
00:19:45,377 --> 00:19:48,981
I'm gonna send Joey and Jasper

283
00:19:49,014 --> 00:19:51,783
to see you Christmas Eve.

284
00:19:51,816 --> 00:19:56,255
One way or the other,
you are gonna pay Big Freddie back.

285
00:19:58,424 --> 00:20:01,093
Or there's gonna be
some big problems.

286
00:20:01,127 --> 00:20:05,064
And you don't want no problems
on Christmas, now do ya, Tony?

287
00:20:05,965 --> 00:20:07,032
No.

288
00:20:08,267 --> 00:20:10,202
No problems on Christmas.

289
00:20:13,405 --> 00:20:17,042
Hey, you do the right thing.

290
00:20:17,076 --> 00:20:18,310
Understand me?

291
00:20:19,811 --> 00:20:22,114
[light upbeat music playing]

292
00:20:37,229 --> 00:20:38,863
I'll be right back, kids.

293
00:20:38,897 --> 00:20:41,799
I gotta handle
some business real quick.

294
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:44,802
Can I bring you back anything?
No?

295
00:20:44,836 --> 00:20:48,307
Good, great, grand!
Bye-bye!

296
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:51,743
Dude, come back!
I have to get home!

297
00:20:51,776 --> 00:20:53,479
I have to get
my hair and makeup done!

298
00:20:53,512 --> 00:20:55,314
Don't worry, little missy,

299
00:20:55,347 --> 00:20:57,849
I'll be right back
and get you home right on time.

300
00:20:57,882 --> 00:20:59,218
I'm shooting a cover!

301
00:21:01,954 --> 00:21:03,489
You can't just leave us here.

302
00:21:03,522 --> 00:21:05,057
Come back!

303
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:06,959
[light upbeat music playing]

304
00:21:15,367 --> 00:21:17,002
[bartender] Hello, sir.

305
00:21:17,036 --> 00:21:19,338
May I interest you
in Robert Renzoni's

306
00:21:19,371 --> 00:21:22,374
- Big Fred's Red?
- I'm good, I'm good.

307
00:21:22,408 --> 00:21:24,376
I'm just waiting for a friend.

308
00:21:26,979 --> 00:21:31,749
It seems as if someone
is trying to get your attention.

309
00:21:31,783 --> 00:21:33,953
How ya doing, you baboon?

310
00:21:35,187 --> 00:21:38,224
Well, baboon you say?

311
00:21:38,257 --> 00:21:41,093
Well, I can only assume
that a baboon won't appreciate

312
00:21:41,126 --> 00:21:45,164
the finest wines in all of this
beautiful Temecula wine country.

313
00:21:45,197 --> 00:21:47,967
We're good.
No wine for us.

314
00:21:50,802 --> 00:21:52,338
What are we doing, Tony?

315
00:21:59,111 --> 00:22:01,113
Where'd you get all that cash?

316
00:22:05,384 --> 00:22:08,786
Can we have two beers please?
And thank yous.

317
00:22:12,391 --> 00:22:14,426
Business has been
picking up lately.

318
00:22:16,395 --> 00:22:20,299
And just in time for
the Annual Christmas Derby.

319
00:22:20,332 --> 00:22:22,301
Hey, it's me.

320
00:22:22,334 --> 00:22:24,503
Now where'd you
really get the money from?

321
00:22:25,971 --> 00:22:29,108
Okay, I borrowed it.

322
00:22:29,141 --> 00:22:31,543
How much did you borrow?

323
00:22:31,577 --> 00:22:32,978
All of it.

324
00:22:34,613 --> 00:22:35,847
Here you go.

325
00:22:40,452 --> 00:22:43,122
All right,
so what are you betting on?

326
00:22:43,155 --> 00:22:49,328
Listen, 20 large,
race number three,

327
00:22:49,361 --> 00:22:53,098
horse number five,
Dolly's Pride.

328
00:22:53,132 --> 00:22:56,435
All she's gotta do is show,
and we're set.

329
00:22:56,468 --> 00:22:57,569
Why that horse?

330
00:22:58,971 --> 00:23:01,507
Uncle Vito
says it's a sure thing!

331
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:05,210
Oh, no,
not one of Uncle Vito's tips!

332
00:23:05,244 --> 00:23:08,080
He's never right, Tony!
You know that!

333
00:23:09,214 --> 00:23:11,016
Listen...

334
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:13,152
this is what
we've been waiting for.

335
00:23:13,185 --> 00:23:17,855
This is the kind of bet will get us out
of debt and change our lives forever!

336
00:23:19,325 --> 00:23:22,227
All right, fine.
Where'd you get the money?

337
00:23:22,261 --> 00:23:25,931
I borrowed it.
Why does that matter?

338
00:23:25,964 --> 00:23:27,899
It was Big Freddie,
wasn't it?

339
00:23:27,933 --> 00:23:30,569
Don't you already owe
Big Freddie a lot of money?

340
00:23:30,602 --> 00:23:31,869
So?!

341
00:23:33,472 --> 00:23:35,507
You must have a death wish,
my friend.

342
00:23:35,541 --> 00:23:38,077
Big Freddie's not
gonna do nothin', okay.

343
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:41,513
I'm probably gonna get him back
the money way before Christmas Eve.

344
00:23:47,119 --> 00:23:48,920
[chuckles]

345
00:23:53,125 --> 00:23:56,028
[perky music playing]

346
00:24:02,134 --> 00:24:05,671
Oh, man, my cop stash
is coming in!

347

[chuckles]

348
00:24:07,606 --> 00:24:09,508
Ooh!

349
00:24:09,541 --> 00:24:10,676
[inhales deeply]

350
00:24:10,709 --> 00:24:14,912
Oh, so delicious and so fresh.

351
00:24:14,947 --> 00:24:17,549
Oh, the lady made 'em,
just made 'em.

352
00:24:17,583 --> 00:24:21,186
Ooh! Ooh, I want
a gluten-free one.

353
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:24,056
Let me see, which one
did she say was the gluten...?

354
00:24:24,089 --> 00:24:26,992
Was it the chocolate
or the vanilla?

355
00:24:27,659 --> 00:24:29,027
Ooh.

356
00:24:30,062 --> 00:24:31,430
Chocolate.

357
00:24:31,463 --> 00:24:34,032
I've been very gluten sensitive
since my colonoscopy,

358
00:24:34,066 --> 00:24:38,137
and healthy choices are part of
a healthy lifestyle.

359
00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:40,639
[dispatch on radio]
<i>Car 21, what is your 10-20?</i>

360
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:46,111
This is Car 21.

361
00:24:46,145 --> 00:24:49,014
I'm at Seasons Street
and California Avenue, over.

362
00:24:49,047 --> 00:24:50,616
<i>I have a 207A at The Pub.</i>

363
00:24:53,986 --> 00:24:57,723
<i>I have a 207A at The Pub,
do you copy?</i>

364
00:24:57,756 --> 00:25:00,292
Always interrupting
my donut time.

365
00:25:00,325 --> 00:25:05,497
[announcer] Welcome folks, to The California
Wine Country Annual Christmas Derby.

366
00:25:05,531 --> 00:25:09,501
<i>I'm your announcer Chip Starr,
here to call the races for you folks.</i>

367
00:25:09,535 --> 00:25:12,671
<i>It's a beautiful day
in the Temecula Wine Country,</i>

368
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:16,508
so sip a little,
sit back and enjoy!

369
00:25:16,542 --> 00:25:20,512
Here we go folks. Our first meet
with a lot of pretty ponies.

370
00:25:20,546 --> 00:25:24,550
First time with us is Filly
For Phyllis and Stretch Adam.

371
00:25:24,583 --> 00:25:27,586
There she is, Dolly's Pride.

372
00:25:29,488 --> 00:25:31,490
Dolly's Pride, here we go!

373
00:25:33,692 --> 00:25:35,561
Here you go, Gino, enjoy!

374
00:25:35,594 --> 00:25:37,129
Thanks, hon.

375
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:40,232
Best of luck to you, man!

376
00:25:40,265 --> 00:25:42,267
I got money
on that little gal, too.

377
00:25:45,571 --> 00:25:47,339
She broke my heart once before,

378
00:25:47,372 --> 00:25:49,408
before but not my bank account,
thank God, you know what I mean?

379
00:25:49,441 --> 00:25:51,743
Oh, I know what you mean.

380
00:25:51,777 --> 00:25:54,146
I don't usually pray
to win a bet

381
00:25:54,179 --> 00:25:56,715
because I figure, you know,
God has better things to do.

382
00:25:57,616 --> 00:25:59,418
But in this case.

383
00:26:00,385 --> 00:26:02,221
Amen.

384
00:26:02,254 --> 00:26:03,388
Two guys praying
for the same thing.

385
00:26:03,422 --> 00:26:05,023
Double the odds, right?

386
00:26:05,057 --> 00:26:06,758
Ah, what do I know, cheers.

387
00:26:07,559 --> 00:26:09,661
Right, bud?

388
00:26:09,695 --> 00:26:12,064
[Chip] <i>Okay, folks,
they're in the gates,</i>

389
00:26:12,097 --> 00:26:14,299
<i>and, they're off!</i>

390
00:26:14,333 --> 00:26:16,101
Hello Kitty Girl takes the lead!

391
00:26:16,134 --> 00:26:18,570
My Kid's Allowance
following closely behind,

392
00:26:18,604 --> 00:26:21,373
with Dolly's Pride
a strong showing in third.

393
00:26:21,406 --> 00:26:25,110
C'mon, Dolly's Pride!
C'mon, you're a sure thing!

394
00:26:25,143 --> 00:26:27,479
C'mon, you're supposed to be
a sure thing! C'mon!

395
00:26:27,513 --> 00:26:29,781
[Chip] And here comes
Filly For Phyllis

396
00:26:29,815 --> 00:26:32,751
right behind Dolly's Pride,
who is losing some steam.

397
00:26:32,784 --> 00:26:35,120
C'mon, Dolly's Pride, c'mon!

398
00:26:35,153 --> 00:26:38,724
[Chip] Stretch Adam now in third behind
Hello Kitty Girl and Dolly's Pride.

399
00:26:38,757 --> 00:26:43,662
Come on! Come on!
Yeah, Dolly's Pride, come on! Come on!

400
00:26:43,695 --> 00:26:46,164
[Chip] Dolly's Pride
is still falling, folks!

401
00:26:46,198 --> 00:26:49,234
- No!
- [Chip] Ask Your Mom takes a strangle hold on first

402
00:26:49,268 --> 00:26:51,236
while Stretch Adam
pushes for second,

403
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:53,772
neck and neck with Hello Kitty
Girl, two lengths behind.

404
00:26:53,805 --> 00:26:55,641
This may be
a photo finish folks!

405
00:26:55,674 --> 00:26:57,543
Come on, Dolly's Pride!

406
00:26:57,576 --> 00:27:00,078
We need this win or else!

407
00:27:00,112 --> 00:27:03,649
[Chip] No wait! Buster Blue is on
the outside making a challenge.

408
00:27:03,682 --> 00:27:05,817
But Ask Your Mom holds his own!

409
00:27:05,851 --> 00:27:08,820
Wait for it!
And the stallion takes it!

410
00:27:08,854 --> 00:27:11,723
- [groans]
- [Chip] <i>What a race, folks!</i>

411
00:27:11,757 --> 00:27:14,760
There's your winner, folks,
Ask Your Mom,

412
00:27:14,793 --> 00:27:16,395
- <i>followed by Stretch Adam...</i>
- No!

413
00:27:16,428 --> 00:27:19,531
<i>...and Hello Kitty Girl!</i>

414
00:27:19,565 --> 00:27:22,801
Ah, folks, Dolly's Pride
brings up the rear.

415
00:27:22,834 --> 00:27:25,704
She's nearly placed
her last few races.

416
00:27:25,737 --> 00:27:27,773
<i>Sure came up short today.</i>

417
00:27:27,806 --> 00:27:30,709
What a shame folks.
Such a shame.

418
00:27:32,311 --> 00:27:33,512
Sorry, man.

419
00:27:34,913 --> 00:27:37,349
[Doug] I think
we're gonna need two more.

420
00:27:37,382 --> 00:27:38,517
Pronto!

421
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:40,252
Please and thank yous!

422
00:28:03,542 --> 00:28:05,644
- [girl] Help us!
- Yeah, coming.

423
00:28:13,619 --> 00:28:15,287
Everybody okay?

424
00:28:18,924 --> 00:28:20,192
[grunts]

425
00:28:22,594 --> 00:28:23,695
All right,
everybody off the bus.

426
00:28:23,729 --> 00:28:25,197
C'mon on out,
one at a time, c'mon.

427
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:26,598
I lied.

428
00:28:26,632 --> 00:28:28,600
I've been gouging prices
on my customers

429
00:28:28,634 --> 00:28:30,402
for the past three months.

430
00:28:30,435 --> 00:28:32,871
Trying to save enough money
to pay off my debts.

431
00:28:32,904 --> 00:28:34,206
What?

432
00:28:34,239 --> 00:28:35,507
Yeah, you shoulda seen me,

433
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:38,410
releasing crickets
in my customer's kitchen.

434
00:28:38,443 --> 00:28:41,279
Got thrown out of three mansions
in one day over.

435
00:28:41,313 --> 00:28:43,248
Well, maybe over my prices.

436
00:28:43,281 --> 00:28:45,617
Or some off color
remark I said.

437
00:29:02,501 --> 00:29:04,403
And I still can't
pay back Big Freddie.

438
00:29:04,436 --> 00:29:06,571
I mean, look what
I just lost right here.

439
00:29:06,605 --> 00:29:09,675
And he gave me the deadline
of Christmas Eve.

440
00:29:09,708 --> 00:29:11,510
Ah, crap!

441
00:29:11,543 --> 00:29:14,713
I forgot about those kids
I left out on my bus.

442
00:29:14,746 --> 00:29:15,948
There's the guy
who kidnapped us!

443
00:29:15,982 --> 00:29:17,916
He made me
miss my photo shoot!

444
00:29:19,418 --> 00:29:20,886
Sorry, pal, gotta go.

445
00:29:20,919 --> 00:29:21,920
Where you going?

446
00:29:24,523 --> 00:29:25,691
Freeze!

447
00:29:29,895 --> 00:29:31,697
You're under arrest,
hold still.

448
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:33,398
You have the right
to remain silent...

449
00:29:33,432 --> 00:29:35,400
Yeah, yeah, I know the spiel.

450
00:29:35,434 --> 00:29:37,669
Been watching <i>Law and Order</i>
for years!

451
00:29:37,703 --> 00:29:39,404
Hold still.

452
00:29:39,438 --> 00:29:40,739
I got my Miranda card
right here.

453
00:29:42,008 --> 00:29:43,675
This is so much easier in
the Academy

454
00:29:43,709 --> 00:29:45,310
on a practice dummy.

455
00:29:45,343 --> 00:29:47,446
You have the right
to remain silent.

456
00:29:47,479 --> 00:29:49,648
You have the right
to an attorney.

457
00:29:49,681 --> 00:29:52,317
If you can't afford an attorney,
which looks like you can't,

458
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:56,022
one will be present at the time and
then one will be paid for by the state.

459
00:29:56,055 --> 00:29:57,923
- Do you understand these rights?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

460
00:29:57,957 --> 00:29:59,458
A dummy never talks back.

461
00:30:02,861 --> 00:30:05,430
Why's your friend
getting arrested?

462
00:30:05,464 --> 00:30:09,701
He kidnapped some kids to hang
out with me and play the ponies.

463
00:30:11,903 --> 00:30:14,573
- Well, how did you do?
- I lost.

464
00:30:14,606 --> 00:30:17,509
It was supposed to be
a sure thing.

465
00:30:17,542 --> 00:30:18,744
So my uncle said so.

466
00:30:24,649 --> 00:30:28,286
I'm sorry we were
a bit cranky earlier.

467
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:32,390
- You should be.
- I am.

468
00:30:35,393 --> 00:30:37,964
So how much did you lose?

469
00:30:37,997 --> 00:30:41,000
Don't you think that's a bit
of an intrusive question?

470
00:30:41,033 --> 00:30:46,038
Well, I'm an intrusive woman.
Sue me.

471
00:30:46,838 --> 00:30:48,840
I lost a lot,

472
00:30:48,874 --> 00:30:51,010
and if I don't
pay it back by Christmas Eve,

473
00:30:51,043 --> 00:30:52,778
I'm a dead man walking.

474
00:30:52,811 --> 00:30:56,082
Wow!
What the heck were you thinking?

475
00:30:56,115 --> 00:30:57,449
I wasn't thinking!

476
00:31:12,564 --> 00:31:14,466
So you're an exterminator, huh?

477
00:31:14,499 --> 00:31:15,767
Yep.

478
00:31:15,801 --> 00:31:18,070
What's your specialty?

479
00:31:18,104 --> 00:31:22,707
Well, you know,
your rats and roaches...

480
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:27,546
you know,
your common garden snakes,

481
00:31:27,579 --> 00:31:30,950
and crickets,
and whatever bugs ya.

482
00:31:31,917 --> 00:31:33,418
Got you covered.

483
00:31:33,451 --> 00:31:34,853
Well, that's pretty funny,
bug puns.

484
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:36,721
I like that.

485
00:31:36,755 --> 00:31:40,859
Yeah, so, what's the damage?

486
00:31:40,892 --> 00:31:43,495
- What do I owe you?
- Don't worry about it.

487
00:31:43,528 --> 00:31:45,864
Listen, I don't need your charity.
What do I owe you?

488
00:31:45,897 --> 00:31:49,101
After the way you gambled today,
I think you do need my charity.

489
00:31:52,071 --> 00:31:54,406
- I'm sorry.
- No, you're not.

490
00:31:54,439 --> 00:31:58,810
- Sorry, not sorry.
- [laughs]

491
00:31:58,844 --> 00:32:02,747
Well, thanks for reminding me
what a loser I am.

492
00:32:02,781 --> 00:32:08,486
Maybe I'll come back and lose some
more, if I'm not dead in seven days.

493
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:12,757
Wait a minute.
Let me get your number.

494
00:32:12,791 --> 00:32:14,994
What, are you trying to
ask me out for a date?

495
00:32:15,027 --> 00:32:20,899
Actually, no, but I have a money opportunity
that'll solve all your problems.

496
00:32:22,034 --> 00:32:24,469
- Is that so?
- Maybe.

497
00:32:25,871 --> 00:32:29,141
No promises, but maybe.

498
00:32:39,451 --> 00:32:42,420
[slow paced music playing]

499
00:32:51,964 --> 00:32:53,665
[car beeping]

500
00:33:12,817 --> 00:33:15,187
[phone ringing]

501
00:33:36,943 --> 00:33:38,910
Daniel, there's something
I wanna tell you.

502
00:33:40,712 --> 00:33:41,981
Mommy has made some plans

503
00:33:42,014 --> 00:33:43,215
for Ace to go on a little trip.

504
00:33:43,249 --> 00:33:44,683
[Ace] Oh, is that
what you're calling it?

505
00:33:44,716 --> 00:33:48,254
A trip? You mean like a vacation?
Where to, Mom?

506
00:33:48,287 --> 00:33:50,855
Just somewhere close by
and just for a couple of days.

507
00:33:50,889 --> 00:33:53,525
How come, Mom?

508
00:33:53,558 --> 00:33:56,028
Well, you know
how special Ace is to us.

509
00:33:56,062 --> 00:33:58,998
It'll just be a few days and then
he's gonna be right back home.

510
00:33:59,031 --> 00:34:02,234
Ace sure is special.
He's so smart.

511
00:34:02,268 --> 00:34:06,005
He's like a big dog to me.
I love Ace, Mom.

512
00:34:06,038 --> 00:34:09,041
I know you do, son.
I know you do.

513
00:34:09,075 --> 00:34:12,244
And Ace, he loves you so much.

514
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:16,915
Well, we better hurry up.
We got a big day ahead of us,

515
00:34:16,949 --> 00:34:18,750
and we've got a lot
of Christmas shopping to do.

516
00:34:18,783 --> 00:34:20,785
- Come on, Ace.
- [Ace] A big dog?

517
00:34:20,819 --> 00:34:24,190
Oh, come on Daniel, can't you
come up with a better comparison?

518
00:34:24,223 --> 00:34:26,192
I sure don't wanna
go on any trip.

519
00:34:26,225 --> 00:34:29,627
If only I could stay home and
look after you like I always have.

520
00:34:29,661 --> 00:34:32,597
[slow perky music playing]

521
00:34:34,934 --> 00:34:36,936
Hey, man, thanks for everything.

522
00:34:36,969 --> 00:34:39,038
- Absolutely.
- I'll see you at the poetry reading next week?

523
00:34:39,071 --> 00:34:41,974
Yeah, for sure. And remember,
I'm gonna challenge you

524
00:34:42,008 --> 00:34:44,210
for that title you've held
the last two years straight.

525
00:34:44,243 --> 00:34:46,878
The Annual Christmas
Chili Cook Off Championship.

526
00:34:46,911 --> 00:34:49,647
Are you gonna make that gluten-free
recipe you told me about?

527
00:34:49,681 --> 00:34:50,950
Yes, sir, it's a winner.

528
00:34:50,983 --> 00:34:52,884
And it helps the effects
of eating beans too.

529
00:34:52,917 --> 00:34:55,254
- Boy, do I know!
- [chuckles]

530
00:34:55,287 --> 00:34:57,555
Come on now, Dougie,
your ride's over there.

531
00:34:57,589 --> 00:34:59,258
It was a pleasure meeting you,
high five.

532
00:34:59,291 --> 00:35:00,692
Last chance on the donuts.

533
00:35:01,826 --> 00:35:03,728
- All right!
- Take it easy!

534
00:35:03,762 --> 00:35:06,298
[festive music playing]

535
00:35:26,085 --> 00:35:27,752
[music stops]

536
00:35:27,786 --> 00:35:31,157
What the heck
happened to you last night?

537
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:34,093
- What do you mean?
- What do I mean?

538
00:35:34,126 --> 00:35:36,062
What do you mean,
what do I mean?

539
00:35:36,095 --> 00:35:37,363
What happened to you
after you got

540
00:35:37,396 --> 00:35:39,764
dragged out of there
by the police?

541
00:35:39,798 --> 00:35:41,333
And then this morning,

542
00:35:41,367 --> 00:35:43,102
you come out
of the police station

543
00:35:43,135 --> 00:35:46,072
with your new bestie,
talking about poetry readings

544
00:35:46,105 --> 00:35:47,973
and a chili cook off?

545
00:35:48,007 --> 00:35:52,777
Yeah, so they booked me for
kidnapping and child endangerment.

546
00:35:52,811 --> 00:35:55,647
Child endangerment?

547
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,950
They were a bunch
of bratty teenagers.

548
00:35:57,983 --> 00:36:03,755
Yeah, so, I'm thinking I'm definitely
going to prison for the rest of my life.

549
00:36:03,788 --> 00:36:07,259
But the cops got a bunch of
calls from the kid's parents

550
00:36:07,293 --> 00:36:09,828
saying they don't
wanna press charges.

551
00:36:12,331 --> 00:36:15,000
So, what happened?

552
00:36:15,034 --> 00:36:17,970
Well, then the other kid's
parents call,

553
00:36:18,003 --> 00:36:19,405
they don't wanna press charges,

554
00:36:19,438 --> 00:36:23,242
they're calling the precinct
and City Hall, too!

555
00:36:23,275 --> 00:36:29,181
- So... What, why?
- Well, that's what I say!

556
00:36:29,215 --> 00:36:32,851
Well, it turns out a cement
truck turned over on my route,

557
00:36:32,884 --> 00:36:35,221
would've flattened the bus,

558
00:36:35,254 --> 00:36:38,124
so actually,
I saved all their kids!

559
00:36:38,157 --> 00:36:41,793
How great is that, huh?
I'm a freakin' hero!

560
00:36:41,826 --> 00:36:45,064
[laughs] So you're like
the Teflon Dougie, yeah?

561
00:36:45,097 --> 00:36:47,233
Yeah, I am!

562
00:36:47,266 --> 00:36:49,767
You didn't get trouble at all?

563
00:36:49,801 --> 00:36:51,870
Well, I did get fired,

564
00:36:51,903 --> 00:36:54,706
but I was gonna quit
that job anyway.

565
00:36:56,008 --> 00:36:58,843
And what about
creepin' on that crush?

566
00:36:58,877 --> 00:37:00,678
That art teacher.

567
00:37:00,712 --> 00:37:04,016
Well, I'll get another job
at the school.

568
00:37:04,049 --> 00:37:05,683
Maybe as a teacher?

569
00:37:06,318 --> 00:37:08,354
A teacher?

570
00:37:08,387 --> 00:37:09,921
Are you serious?

571
00:37:09,955 --> 00:37:13,725
Good luck with that, pal.

572
00:37:13,758 --> 00:37:17,029
All right, so what happened
with you last night?

573
00:37:17,062 --> 00:37:19,999
Actually, it went really,
really good.

574
00:37:20,032 --> 00:37:22,700
[sighs]

575
00:37:22,734 --> 00:37:28,840
I, uh, I started talking with
that beautiful barmaid at The Pub,

576
00:37:28,873 --> 00:37:31,310
and she asked for
my number, too.

577
00:37:31,343 --> 00:37:34,380
- That's great, pal!
- I know.

578
00:37:34,413 --> 00:37:37,815
Yeah, but,
it really doesn't matter.

579
00:37:37,849 --> 00:37:41,020
Why?
I mean, that's great news!

580
00:37:41,053 --> 00:37:43,088
You need good news!

581
00:37:43,122 --> 00:37:46,858
Yeah, but when Big Freddie
finds out... [sighs]

582
00:37:46,891 --> 00:37:50,762
I can't pay him
on Christmas Eve, I'm done.

583
00:37:50,795 --> 00:37:56,101
- Oh, and also, by the way, we got evicted yesterday.
- What?

584
00:37:56,135 --> 00:37:59,338
Yeah, I fell asleep at the
apartment last night in the car,

585
00:37:59,371 --> 00:38:01,706
and when I woke up,
I found this.

586
00:38:07,812 --> 00:38:09,747
[phone ringing]

587
00:38:12,017 --> 00:38:14,253
Tony's phone, who dis?

588
00:38:14,286 --> 00:38:15,421
Come on, give me the phone.

589
00:38:15,454 --> 00:38:17,423
Amanda you say?
It's Dougie!

590
00:38:17,456 --> 00:38:19,325
- I said give me the phone!
- I met you last night!

591
00:38:19,358 --> 00:38:22,027
- <i>Yeah, at The Pub!</i>
- [Tony] <i>Give me the phone!</i>

592
00:38:22,061 --> 00:38:24,862
Yeah, I got hauled outta there
with the cops.

593
00:38:24,896 --> 00:38:27,266
Made a big scene.
How ya doing?

594
00:38:32,104 --> 00:38:33,339
Hello.

595
00:38:33,372 --> 00:38:37,142
Hey, Tony, glad to hear
your friend's okay.

596
00:38:37,176 --> 00:38:39,378
Yeah, yeah, he's okay for now.

597
00:38:39,411 --> 00:38:41,413
[chuckles]

598
00:38:41,447 --> 00:38:43,815
So how are you
feeling this morning?

599
00:38:43,848 --> 00:38:46,418
I'll survive, hopefully.
How you doing?

600
00:38:46,452 --> 00:38:49,821
Hey, I just wanted to call
because I might have a way

601
00:38:49,854 --> 00:38:52,024
that you can
earn that money that you owe.

602
00:38:53,225 --> 00:38:54,926
Put her on speaker.

603
00:38:58,297 --> 00:39:02,067
Really?
Sounds good to me. How?

604
00:39:02,101 --> 00:39:04,836
I'd rather talk to you
about it in person.

605
00:39:04,869 --> 00:39:06,871
Is there any way
you're available to meet me now?

606
00:39:11,210 --> 00:39:12,544
Okay.

607
00:39:12,578 --> 00:39:15,414
Okay, well,
I'm house sitting right now

608
00:39:15,447 --> 00:39:17,316
at my brother's house
while he's out of town.

609
00:39:17,349 --> 00:39:23,188
I'll text you the address.
Meet me here in an hour?

610
00:39:23,222 --> 00:39:26,158
You need this thing
done right now?

611
00:39:26,191 --> 00:39:29,161
Do you wanna wait for that guy you
owe money to knock you off first,

612
00:39:29,194 --> 00:39:31,230
or you'd rather make it
to another Christmas?

613
00:39:31,263 --> 00:39:33,399
We'll be right over.

614
00:39:33,432 --> 00:39:36,135
Okay, until then.

615
00:39:36,168 --> 00:39:37,802
[festive music playing]

616
00:39:44,943 --> 00:39:47,112
[Dougie]
<i>What could she need us to do?</i>

617
00:39:47,146 --> 00:39:52,017
If Amanda has a way
of helping us pay off our debts,

618
00:39:52,884 --> 00:39:54,919
it's worth listening to.

619
00:39:54,953 --> 00:39:57,189
We got no other
options anyways.

620
00:39:58,324 --> 00:40:00,259
Very true.

621
00:40:00,292 --> 00:40:03,228
This could be the Christmas
miracle I've been praying for.

622
00:40:59,485 --> 00:41:03,489
- Hiya!
- Well, is Amanda around?

623
00:41:03,522 --> 00:41:07,559
Daniel, I thought I told you to get
Mommy and to not answer the door?

624
00:41:07,593 --> 00:41:09,995
But I didn't let them in.
I just opened the door

625
00:41:10,028 --> 00:41:11,363
and they were already
standing there.

626
00:41:11,397 --> 00:41:13,132
Alright, why don't you
just go play for a little while

627
00:41:13,165 --> 00:41:15,200
and I'll get you when lunch
is ready, okay, sweetie?

628
00:41:15,234 --> 00:41:17,236
- Can we go visit Ace?
- Sure.

629
00:41:18,103 --> 00:41:19,405
Sorry about that.

630
00:41:19,438 --> 00:41:20,639
No, it's okay.

631
00:41:20,672 --> 00:41:22,141
You know,
cute kid you got there.

632
00:41:22,174 --> 00:41:23,175
Thank you.

633
00:41:23,208 --> 00:41:24,243
Come on in.

634
00:41:37,289 --> 00:41:41,560
Boy, your brother must have a pretty
killer job to afford a place like this.

635
00:41:41,593 --> 00:41:43,695
You could say that.

636
00:41:43,729 --> 00:41:46,532
Um, can I get you guys
something to drink?

637
00:41:46,565 --> 00:41:48,500
- Coffee, soda...
- I'll take a whiskey.

638
00:41:48,534 --> 00:41:51,036
What are you bothering
the nice lady for, huh?

639
00:41:52,438 --> 00:41:55,240
She offered us
soda and coffee, huh?

640
00:41:56,508 --> 00:41:58,410
Right?

641
00:41:58,444 --> 00:42:01,413
- We'll just take a coffee.
- Okay.

642
00:42:01,447 --> 00:42:04,716
Why don't you guys just go outside and
have a seat and I'll be right back.

643
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:07,286
[light gentle music playing]

644
00:42:12,090 --> 00:42:14,593
I think you hit the jackpot
with this one, pal.

645
00:42:14,626 --> 00:42:16,328
What do ya mean?

646
00:42:16,361 --> 00:42:17,729
Look at this place!

647
00:42:17,763 --> 00:42:20,098
This chick
is rolling in it, man.

648
00:42:20,766 --> 00:42:23,068
No, her brother is.

649
00:42:23,101 --> 00:42:26,772
She's the new barmaid
at The Pub, remember?

650
00:42:26,805 --> 00:42:30,008
Oh, so you think her brother's
gonna let her be poor?

651
00:42:30,042 --> 00:42:31,743
This chick could be
the meal ticket

652
00:42:31,777 --> 00:42:34,746
we've been searching for
our whole lives!

653
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:38,217
- Our lives?
- Yeah, our!

654
00:42:38,250 --> 00:42:42,287
Whatever she needs doing,
me and yous gonna do it together.

655
00:42:42,321 --> 00:42:43,622
Wonderful.

656
00:42:51,697 --> 00:42:54,299
Thanks for coming on
such short notice, guys.

657
00:42:58,403 --> 00:42:59,571
Thanks for the opportunity.

658
00:42:59,605 --> 00:43:02,140
Yeah, the opportunity to...

659
00:43:02,174 --> 00:43:03,642
What are we doing here?

660
00:43:04,576 --> 00:43:06,411
Ow! Stop doing that!

661
00:43:06,445 --> 00:43:08,514
You know I bruise like a tomato!

662
00:43:10,682 --> 00:43:15,454
So, Amanda,
can you fill us in

663
00:43:15,487 --> 00:43:17,823
on exactly what you would
like us to get done?

664
00:43:17,856 --> 00:43:21,527
So, my brother, he has been
racing horses for years,

665
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:24,296
and his biggest winner is Ace.

666
00:43:24,329 --> 00:43:26,398
And that's the horse
I need your help with.

667
00:43:27,866 --> 00:43:31,537
I just need you
to take him away for a while.

668
00:43:31,570 --> 00:43:35,140
Just until I can get some
funding for my brother situated.

669
00:43:36,341 --> 00:43:40,212
Funding?
What does that mean?

670
00:43:40,245 --> 00:43:47,119
I just need you to take Ace a
while and keep him somewhere.

671
00:43:47,152 --> 00:43:54,126
- So you need a horse sitter?
- No, not exactly.

672
00:43:54,159 --> 00:43:56,428
You see my brother,
he made a bet

673
00:43:56,461 --> 00:43:59,464
against his arch enemy,
Renzoni's eldest son,

674
00:43:59,498 --> 00:44:03,235
that Ace can beat his horse
in the New Year's Day Derby.

675
00:44:03,268 --> 00:44:10,175
So what you're saying is you don't want
your brother's horse to run this race?

676
00:44:10,208 --> 00:44:11,376
Not really.

677
00:44:11,410 --> 00:44:13,412
Why would your brother

678
00:44:13,445 --> 00:44:18,216
race his horse that can't win?

679
00:44:18,250 --> 00:44:21,286
Because, sadly, my brother

680
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:24,590
is easily manipulated
into doing things he shouldn't.

681
00:44:24,623 --> 00:44:28,860
[chuckles] Like cheating
on his wife of 12 years

682
00:44:28,894 --> 00:44:30,829
and leaving her without a dime.

683
00:44:30,862 --> 00:44:33,799
Or starting a family
that he abandoned.

684
00:44:33,832 --> 00:44:36,802
Or ignoring his only child.

685
00:44:36,835 --> 00:44:41,907
Or getting himself into bets
and races that he might not win,

686
00:44:41,941 --> 00:44:43,675
risking everything.

687
00:44:44,776 --> 00:44:47,646
All because his pride

688
00:44:47,679 --> 00:44:51,149
cannot back down
from a longtime rival!

689
00:44:51,183 --> 00:44:53,552
Whoa, sounds like
a real piece of work.

690
00:44:53,585 --> 00:44:55,654
Oh, come on!

691
00:44:55,687 --> 00:44:57,322
Tony!

692
00:44:57,356 --> 00:44:59,491
Leave him alone, he's not wrong!

693
00:44:59,524 --> 00:45:01,460
Brandon is a piece of work.

694
00:45:01,493 --> 00:45:02,594
So in other words,

695
00:45:02,628 --> 00:45:04,763
you want us to horse nap Ace

696
00:45:04,796 --> 00:45:07,265
so he can't run in the race?

697
00:45:07,299 --> 00:45:09,568
What's that
supposed to accomplish?

698
00:45:09,601 --> 00:45:12,404
Everything that you see here,

699
00:45:12,437 --> 00:45:16,575
my brother's entire estate,
is on the line.

700
00:45:16,608 --> 00:45:20,479
It's his estate against
Renzoni Vineyards and Farms.

701
00:45:20,512 --> 00:45:24,416
And this property,
it's half Daniel's.

702
00:45:24,449 --> 00:45:29,488
Wait, Renzoni, as in,
Roberto Renzoni?

703
00:45:29,521 --> 00:45:32,224
As in the owner
of the Renzoni Vineyards?

704
00:45:32,257 --> 00:45:34,192
And the Renzoni Estates?

705
00:45:34,226 --> 00:45:35,962
One in the same.

706
00:45:35,995 --> 00:45:39,264
The Renzoni family own half this
town and most of the vineyards in it.

707
00:45:39,297 --> 00:45:41,900
So why don't you want
your brother's horse to race?

708
00:45:41,934 --> 00:45:45,570
I do want Ace to race,
but before that happens,

709
00:45:45,604 --> 00:45:49,408
I want my brother
to have to pay to get Ace back.

710
00:45:49,441 --> 00:45:52,844
Pay?
You mean like a ransom?

711
00:45:52,878 --> 00:45:55,480
[scoffs]

712
00:45:55,514 --> 00:45:58,583
I mean, I wouldn't call it
that exactly.

713
00:45:58,617 --> 00:46:00,252
But if you do this for me,

714
00:46:00,285 --> 00:46:03,555
I can give you
a large sum of money.

715
00:46:03,588 --> 00:46:05,958
Maybe even enough
to pay off all your debts.

716
00:46:13,699 --> 00:46:15,901
- Really?
- Really?

717
00:46:15,935 --> 00:46:20,006
It's the only way I can think of

718
00:46:20,039 --> 00:46:23,241
to give my son
what rightfully belongs to him.

719
00:46:23,275 --> 00:46:27,646
Sounds like you and your brother
have some bad blood between yous.

720
00:46:27,679 --> 00:46:29,414
Everybody's
got something, right?

721
00:46:30,482 --> 00:46:33,986
Yeah, that's for sure.

722
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:39,391
Look, Ace still gets to race
against Renzoni's horse,

723
00:46:39,424 --> 00:46:41,893
probably win.

724
00:46:41,927 --> 00:46:45,864
My brother will have to give up
some of his precious money.

725
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:51,269
And maybe Daniel and I
will finally get to be able

726
00:46:51,303 --> 00:46:54,606
to find a decent place to live
and not have to struggle so much.

727
00:46:59,878 --> 00:47:03,749
A fee you say? A large fee?

728
00:47:03,782 --> 00:47:06,585
A large fee.

729
00:47:09,521 --> 00:47:10,622
Tony.

730
00:47:10,655 --> 00:47:12,858
[slow romantic music playing]

731
00:47:14,893 --> 00:47:18,296
I really need you
to do this for me.

732
00:47:18,330 --> 00:47:19,831
Please?

733
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:24,770
It's for Daniel's future.

734
00:47:27,606 --> 00:47:30,408
All right,
we'll do it for you, Amanda.

735
00:47:32,011 --> 00:47:33,812
Now where's the victim?

736
00:47:43,555 --> 00:47:45,091
[Ace]
Well, who have we got here?

737
00:47:45,124 --> 00:47:46,691
- [neighs]
- Easy, boy.

738
00:47:46,725 --> 00:47:47,759
[Ace] Are these guys taking me

739
00:47:47,793 --> 00:47:49,028
on that trip you've arranged?

740
00:47:49,061 --> 00:47:51,363
[Tony] Hi, Ace.
How are ya, buddy?

741
00:47:54,633 --> 00:47:57,402
That's a fine specimen
of a horse you got there.

742
00:47:58,403 --> 00:47:59,704
Is he friendly?

743
00:47:59,738 --> 00:48:00,872
Usually.

744
00:48:00,906 --> 00:48:02,374
Usually?

745
00:48:02,407 --> 00:48:04,543
Well, he doesn't often interact

746
00:48:04,576 --> 00:48:07,479
with somebody
trying to kidnap him.

747
00:48:07,512 --> 00:48:09,781
- [Ace] Kidnap?
- Point taken.

748
00:48:09,815 --> 00:48:12,952
[Ace] All my years of
faithful service to this family,

749
00:48:12,985 --> 00:48:14,820
this is what
I get for Christmas?

750
00:48:14,853 --> 00:48:18,790
Easy, boy.
Easy, big fella.

751
00:48:18,824 --> 00:48:20,926
- Whoa, whoa!
- [Ace] Who you calling fella, fella?!

752
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:24,063
Watch out!
The horse is coming in hot!

753
00:48:24,096 --> 00:48:26,698
Why don't you
lower your voice, huh?

754
00:48:26,731 --> 00:48:29,101
You're scarin' the horse
to death over here!

755
00:48:29,135 --> 00:48:30,902
[Ace] He's not scaring me!

756
00:48:30,937 --> 00:48:32,504
If you think
you're gonna take me away,

757
00:48:32,537 --> 00:48:34,639
- you better think again, fella!
- Whoa!

758
00:48:38,077 --> 00:48:40,612
That's it. Come on, pal.

759
00:48:40,645 --> 00:48:41,981
Open your eyes.

760
00:48:43,049 --> 00:48:44,449
Glad to see you're still alive.

761
00:48:45,483 --> 00:48:47,586
What the heck happened to me?

762
00:48:47,619 --> 00:48:49,721
[Ace] You want them
to tell you what has happened?

763
00:48:49,754 --> 00:48:52,124
I'll tell you,
you little punk, you!

764
00:48:52,158 --> 00:48:55,727
That's what you get for trying to
take me and do who knows what with me!

765
00:48:56,895 --> 00:48:57,997
[Tony gibbers]

766
00:48:58,030 --> 00:49:00,465
You really think
I'm stupid enough

767
00:49:00,498 --> 00:49:02,601
to let you take me
without a fight?

768
00:49:02,634 --> 00:49:03,735
What the heck?

769
00:49:03,768 --> 00:49:05,804
Come on, pal,
try and stand up.

770
00:49:06,872 --> 00:49:10,176
Come on, lean on me.
That's it.

771
00:49:10,209 --> 00:49:11,576
[Ace]
Why don't you just take him

772
00:49:11,610 --> 00:49:13,079
to wherever he was
gonna take me!

773
00:49:13,112 --> 00:49:16,548
That'll show him!
No need for that trip Amanda.

774
00:49:21,053 --> 00:49:23,722
Okay, it's time
to get you in the house.

775
00:49:23,755 --> 00:49:25,857
Come on, pal,
you need an ice pack.

776
00:49:25,891 --> 00:49:29,161
[Ace] Better yet, leave him here with
me, let's see how tough he is.

777
00:49:29,195 --> 00:49:31,563
I'll just give him
another Glasgow Kiss.

778
00:49:31,596 --> 00:49:36,002
That'll fix him right up!
[laughing]

779
00:49:37,702 --> 00:49:40,839
Well, hello baby, impressed?

780
00:49:43,742 --> 00:49:46,411
Okay, let's get you
on the couch.

781
00:49:48,114 --> 00:49:50,649
Ooh, lay down, okay.

782
00:49:50,682 --> 00:49:52,484
I'm gonna go get you
an ice pack,

783
00:49:52,517 --> 00:49:53,551
and I'm gonna
call the doctor, too.

784
00:49:53,585 --> 00:49:54,586
I'll be right back.

785
00:49:58,958 --> 00:50:00,525
She's gone now.

786
00:50:00,558 --> 00:50:02,061
So tell me, Tony boy,

787
00:50:02,094 --> 00:50:04,030
what the heck
is going on here?

788
00:50:04,063 --> 00:50:06,098
What's with all
the talking horse stuff?

789
00:50:06,132 --> 00:50:08,067
What's your angle here, pal?

790
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:10,535
There's no stinking angle
here, Dougie!

791
00:50:10,568 --> 00:50:13,605
When I woke up,
this horse was talking to me!

792
00:50:14,639 --> 00:50:15,907
C'mon, Tony!

793
00:50:15,942 --> 00:50:17,876
Stop pulling my leg now!

794
00:50:19,145 --> 00:50:21,513
No, I'm not.

795
00:50:21,546 --> 00:50:24,050
When I banged heads
with that horse,

796
00:50:24,951 --> 00:50:27,186
I was out like a light.

797
00:50:27,219 --> 00:50:31,223
And when I came to,
that horse was talking to me.

798
00:50:31,257 --> 00:50:32,824
I'm telling ya!

799
00:50:32,857 --> 00:50:36,195
I think you got a real
head injury here, my friend.

800
00:50:36,228 --> 00:50:39,597
Amanda, hurry up
with that ice, will ya?

801
00:50:39,631 --> 00:50:40,765
[Tony groans]

802
00:50:41,866 --> 00:50:42,901
Great news.

803
00:50:42,935 --> 00:50:44,636
Spoke to the doctor,

804
00:50:44,669 --> 00:50:46,671
he's in the neighborhood,
he's on his way.

805
00:50:46,705 --> 00:50:48,975
Just keep this on your head.

806
00:50:50,575 --> 00:50:54,013
Amanda? Are you there?

807
00:50:54,046 --> 00:50:55,747
- Right here.
- Amanda, how long

808
00:50:55,780 --> 00:50:57,582
has your brother
had that horse for?

809
00:50:57,615 --> 00:50:59,018
A long time, why?

810
00:50:59,051 --> 00:51:04,056
Because that horse
is talking to me.

811
00:51:04,090 --> 00:51:06,691
Has there ever been
a problem with the horse?

812
00:51:06,725 --> 00:51:09,061
No, why are you asking me that?

813
00:51:10,196 --> 00:51:11,998
[doorbell rings]

814
00:51:12,864 --> 00:51:14,233
Mom, doorbell!

815
00:51:14,266 --> 00:51:15,767
I'll get it!

816
00:51:27,645 --> 00:51:30,216
Dr. Hans, thank you so much
for coming so quickly.

817
00:51:30,249 --> 00:51:33,019
No problem, I was
just at your neighbor's place.

818
00:51:33,052 --> 00:51:35,787
- Oh, good.
- Excuse me.

819
00:51:37,756 --> 00:51:39,924
Guten tag.
Pleasure to meet you.

820
00:51:39,959 --> 00:51:42,627
Hello, Doctor,
nice to meet you.

821
00:51:43,862 --> 00:51:48,533
Let me... let me...
Oops, this way.

822
00:51:49,969 --> 00:51:52,938
Have you breathe deeply for me.

823
00:51:55,274 --> 00:51:59,245
Um, no, Doctor...
Tony's the one that's hurt.

824
00:51:59,278 --> 00:52:01,247
It's the one with the ice pack.

825
00:52:02,881 --> 00:52:04,749
Ah, got it. Yep.

826
00:52:04,783 --> 00:52:07,719
Okay, then,
I'll listen to him first.

827
00:52:07,752 --> 00:52:10,089
[speaking German]

828
00:52:10,122 --> 00:52:11,123
So, okay.

829
00:52:11,957 --> 00:52:13,625
Okay, so...

830
00:52:17,196 --> 00:52:18,330
Mm-hm.

831
00:52:18,364 --> 00:52:20,266
[mutters] Mm-hm.

832
00:52:24,003 --> 00:52:25,071
Oh.

833
00:52:29,942 --> 00:52:33,745
Doesn't seem to be
anything wrong with you.

834
00:52:33,778 --> 00:52:39,584
Tell me, are you
experiencing, um, any headaches?

835
00:52:40,852 --> 00:52:42,654
No, Doc, I'm okay.

836
00:52:42,687 --> 00:52:44,256
I told 'em
I was gonna be all right.

837
00:52:44,290 --> 00:52:47,026
I don't need a doctor.
Okay, no worries.

838
00:52:47,059 --> 00:52:51,330
Mm-hm. Sit up please, sit.

839
00:52:51,363 --> 00:52:56,368
I want to look at your ear
with my otoscope.

840
00:52:56,402 --> 00:52:58,037
My otoscope.

841
00:52:58,070 --> 00:53:00,106
[mumbles]

842
00:53:19,391 --> 00:53:24,130
Never mind, I don't need to
look at your ear canal,

843
00:53:24,163 --> 00:53:29,301
your tympanic membrane,
or your ear drums.

844
00:53:29,335 --> 00:53:33,038
Tell me, are you
hearing a ringing in your ear?

845
00:53:34,373 --> 00:53:37,376
No, Doc, no ringing in the ears.

846
00:53:37,409 --> 00:53:40,712
But I hear a horse talking.

847
00:53:45,384 --> 00:53:47,052
Excuse me?

848
00:53:47,086 --> 00:53:49,888
He said he heard a horse
talk to him!

849
00:53:51,190 --> 00:53:53,459
Wait, Mom, did he just say

850
00:53:53,492 --> 00:53:55,693
that he heard Ace talk to him?

851
00:53:55,727 --> 00:53:57,963
Well, Ace and Tony,

852
00:53:57,997 --> 00:54:00,332
they banged heads,
and then Tony passed out,

853
00:54:00,366 --> 00:54:04,069
and when he came to,
that's what he told us. [chuckles]

854
00:54:04,103 --> 00:54:06,939
That's hysterical.

855
00:54:06,972 --> 00:54:10,342
Ace, a talking horse?
Too funny, Mom.

856
00:54:18,317 --> 00:54:24,123
So, you heard a horse talk?

857
00:54:24,156 --> 00:54:28,460
That's what I said, Doc.
It's talking to me.

858
00:54:28,494 --> 00:54:31,763
And I think he understood
everything I was saying.

859
00:54:34,832 --> 00:54:39,405
And have you heard any other
horses talking to you?

860
00:54:39,438 --> 00:54:44,043
I mean, before this horse
spoke with you today?

861
00:54:44,076 --> 00:54:46,212
I don't deal with
a lot of horses,

862
00:54:46,245 --> 00:54:48,746
but only when I play the ponies.

863
00:54:50,782 --> 00:54:55,787
How about other animals?
Do you hear them speak with you?

864
00:54:56,355 --> 00:54:57,855
No, not really.

865
00:54:57,889 --> 00:55:01,893
Only when I hear them squeal.

866
00:55:01,926 --> 00:55:03,828
When I...
When I get 'em cornered.

867
00:55:05,497 --> 00:55:08,133
[Dougie]
He's an exterminator!

868
00:55:08,167 --> 00:55:11,903
Uh-huh, yeah. So...

869
00:55:11,937 --> 00:55:16,508
I'm gonna be okay, so I wanna
just say thank yous, okay.

870
00:55:16,542 --> 00:55:18,110
Please and thank yous.

871
00:55:18,143 --> 00:55:20,446
He must be right,
he's a doctor.

872
00:55:20,479 --> 00:55:22,982
Look at that medical bag.

873
00:55:23,848 --> 00:55:25,117
Uh-huh.

874
00:55:27,953 --> 00:55:32,324
Okay. Here's my card.

875
00:55:32,358 --> 00:55:35,094
If you develop
any more symptoms,

876
00:55:35,127 --> 00:55:36,495
I want you to call me.

877
00:55:39,331 --> 00:55:40,898
Okay?

878
00:55:40,933 --> 00:55:42,568
[Tony] Okay, you got it, Doc.

879
00:55:42,601 --> 00:55:44,069
And thank yous.

880
00:55:54,046 --> 00:55:56,515
Keep an eye on him.

881
00:55:56,548 --> 00:55:59,485
- I'll see myself to the door.
- Okay, thank you, Dr. Hans.

882
00:56:01,453 --> 00:56:02,854
[exhales]

883
00:56:04,856 --> 00:56:07,393
Amanda, I can't see it,

884
00:56:07,426 --> 00:56:10,828
but, yeah, I think it says something
about a horse doctor on here?

885
00:56:12,231 --> 00:56:15,134
What kind of doctor...
He's a horse doctor?

886
00:56:15,167 --> 00:56:18,971
Well, I did the best I could
in an emergency, Tony.

887
00:56:19,004 --> 00:56:21,340
I mean, he gave you
a thorough exam didn't he?

888
00:56:21,373 --> 00:56:23,908
He did, Tony.
He checked everything on ya.

889
00:56:26,278 --> 00:56:27,546
[Tony grunts]

890
00:56:29,481 --> 00:56:30,482
[Tony gibbers]

891
00:56:33,185 --> 00:56:38,090
Listen, I'll be back in a few.

892
00:56:38,123 --> 00:56:39,358
Where are you going?

893
00:56:41,126 --> 00:56:43,429
I'm going to finish
what I started.

894
00:56:43,462 --> 00:56:45,631
What did he start, Mom?

895
00:56:45,664 --> 00:56:50,202
Um, Tony started a new book
for our book club, sweetie.

896
00:56:52,971 --> 00:56:55,474
Now don't you think
that you should just rest

897
00:56:55,507 --> 00:56:58,177
and maybe not finish
what you started?

898
00:56:58,210 --> 00:56:59,645
It's getting late.

899
00:56:59,678 --> 00:57:02,114
No, I'm gonna be good.

900
00:57:02,147 --> 00:57:04,583
I'm all right.

901
00:57:04,616 --> 00:57:08,087
Listen, I can get someone
to fill in for you, okay.

902
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:09,887
You probably need your rest.

903
00:57:09,921 --> 00:57:12,558
I mean, you did bang heads
with a horse.

904
00:57:12,591 --> 00:57:14,426
No, Amanda.

905
00:57:15,394 --> 00:57:17,429
I need to do this myself.

906
00:57:21,033 --> 00:57:25,270
[Ace] Oh, you back for more,
you little horse thief?

907
00:57:25,304 --> 00:57:27,306
I'm not hearing this.

908
00:57:27,339 --> 00:57:30,476
[Ace] Heck, you can hear me,
and I heard you!

909
00:57:30,509 --> 00:57:34,213
Trying to make off with me.
Try again and see what happens!

910
00:57:35,314 --> 00:57:37,583
How am I hearing you talk?

911
00:57:38,384 --> 00:57:39,917
I just don't get it!

912
00:57:39,952 --> 00:57:41,453
[Ace]
Maybe this is your punishment

913
00:57:41,487 --> 00:57:43,689
for even making
an attempt to take me

914
00:57:43,722 --> 00:57:46,959
from the only home
I've ever known.

915
00:57:46,992 --> 00:57:52,231
I'm sorry about that, Ace,
but my back is against the wall.

916
00:57:52,264 --> 00:57:58,303
If I don't pay back the money I
owe, I'm a dead man.

917
00:57:58,337 --> 00:58:01,006
[Ace] Is that all this is about?
Money?

918
00:58:01,039 --> 00:58:05,677
[laughs] Why didn't you say so?
I've got money.

919
00:58:05,711 --> 00:58:09,181
Well, actually, Brandon,
he's got a ton of cash

920
00:58:09,214 --> 00:58:12,551
from me winning
so many races all these years.

921
00:58:12,584 --> 00:58:17,389
Amanda says that you'll lose
to Renzoni's horse.

922
00:58:17,423 --> 00:58:20,692
[Ace] Have you no idea
of my pedigree?

923
00:58:20,726 --> 00:58:24,329
My bloodline dates
all the way back to Arabia,

924
00:58:24,363 --> 00:58:26,632
before we were
brought to America.

925
00:58:28,167 --> 00:58:31,170
I am a true
Arabian thoroughbred.

926
00:58:31,203 --> 00:58:35,374
All about the heart.
Most people don't get that.

927
00:58:35,407 --> 00:58:39,445
A horse with a bigger heart
is more likely to succeed,

928
00:58:39,478 --> 00:58:44,283
because the heart is stronger and can
pump more blood throughout the body.

929
00:58:45,651 --> 00:58:47,753
I've got all the right moves,

930
00:58:47,786 --> 00:58:52,491
and the speed to take down
Renzoni's puny pony.

931
00:58:52,524 --> 00:58:56,228
Does no one have faith in me?

932
00:58:56,261 --> 00:59:00,566
I do, fella, but I just gotta
get this over with.

933
00:59:00,599 --> 00:59:03,368
[Ace]
Hold your horses there, mister.

934
00:59:05,037 --> 00:59:06,638
Wow, nothing?

935
00:59:06,672 --> 00:59:11,310
Your attempt with comedy
is worse than Dougie's.

936
00:59:11,343 --> 00:59:14,446
[Ace] Eh, okay,
that wasn't my best.

937
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:18,116
But I have one more option.
How about this?

938
00:59:18,150 --> 00:59:21,153
What if I help you
win a couple of sure things,

939
00:59:21,186 --> 00:59:23,288
you get the money
to pay off your debts,

940
00:59:23,322 --> 00:59:27,259
plus some to keep for yourself.
How's that sound?

941
00:59:27,292 --> 00:59:30,596
- So how you gonna do that?
- [Ace] Take me to the track.

942
00:59:30,629 --> 00:59:34,666
I can talk to a few of the horses
there, pull a favor or two.

943
00:59:34,700 --> 00:59:39,505
Wait, what? You can talk with
the other horses?

944
00:59:39,538 --> 00:59:43,475
[Ace] Trust me. I've got a lot
of friends who owe me favors.

945
00:59:43,509 --> 00:59:47,179
I can make this happen.
You could even test me.

946
00:59:47,212 --> 00:59:51,650
Bet the way I tell you
on one race and you'll see.

947
00:59:51,683 --> 00:59:53,318
[Amanda]
What are you doing, Tony?

948
00:59:55,087 --> 00:59:57,689
Nothing.
I was just thinking.

949
00:59:57,723 --> 00:59:59,525
Still hearing voices, pal?

950
00:59:59,558 --> 01:00:03,395
No, but I think I got
a better idea to make the money,

951
01:00:03,428 --> 01:00:07,099
instead of horse napping
this magnificent horse.

952
01:00:07,132 --> 01:00:09,334
[Ace] Well, looks like
we've got a deal!

953
01:00:09,368 --> 01:00:10,702
<i>And I'm gonna show you all</i>

954
01:00:10,736 --> 01:00:13,305
<i>what loyalty and friendship
is all about.</i>

955
01:00:13,338 --> 01:00:15,173
<i>Take me to the track!</i>

956
01:00:26,685 --> 01:00:29,755
Mom, look at all the horses!

957
01:00:32,157 --> 01:00:34,226
What, Daniel's never been to
the track before?

958
01:00:34,259 --> 01:00:36,094
Oh, he's been around horses
all his life,

959
01:00:36,128 --> 01:00:38,330
but he's never been to
a race track before.

960
01:00:38,363 --> 01:00:39,865
Looks like Daniel's
having fun.

961
01:00:39,898 --> 01:00:41,633
[Amanda] So, what are we
doing here anyway?

962
01:00:41,667 --> 01:00:45,837
[Tony] Oh, you'll see.
You'll see.

963
01:00:45,871 --> 01:00:47,205
Alright, big fella.

964
01:00:47,239 --> 01:00:48,640
[Ace]
Hey, how's everybody doing?

965
01:00:48,674 --> 01:00:51,843
- Good to see ya.
- [horse whinnies]

966
01:00:51,877 --> 01:00:54,446
[Ace] Hey, Champ,
good to see ya again.

967
01:00:57,516 --> 01:01:00,485
Take me over to the horse down at the
end, I recognize him.

968
01:01:03,822 --> 01:01:05,624
Yep, just what I thought!

969
01:01:05,657 --> 01:01:08,327
That's Sir Blake,
we go way back.

970
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:11,663
A fine thoroughbred.
Heck of a racehorse!

971
01:01:11,697 --> 01:01:13,832
Take me to him.

972
01:01:13,865 --> 01:01:15,667
What's happening, bro?
How ya been?

973
01:01:15,701 --> 01:01:17,135
Haven't seen you in a minute.

974
01:01:17,903 --> 01:01:19,504
Who do you race today?

975
01:01:19,538 --> 01:01:21,840
[Sir Blake] Well, they've got me
up against Bradley's Gal.

976
01:01:21,873 --> 01:01:24,643
[Ace] Wow, Bradley's Gal!
Really?

977
01:01:24,676 --> 01:01:26,244
But haven't you beat her before?

978
01:01:26,278 --> 01:01:28,447
I can't believe it,
I hear them both.

979
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:29,648
What's happening here?

980
01:01:29,681 --> 01:01:31,316
[Ace] Why is that so surprising?

981
01:01:31,350 --> 01:01:33,251
You hear me
so you hear my friends, too.

982
01:01:33,285 --> 01:01:36,254
Now shush, I'm negotiating.

983
01:01:36,288 --> 01:01:38,790
A bit overrated,
isn't that spunky little filly?

984
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:44,329
I need to ask you a favor.
I need a sure thing.

985
01:01:44,363 --> 01:01:46,698
Step over here
for a moment, Blake.

986
01:01:53,639 --> 01:01:56,475
[Sir Blake] Alright,
put your money on Bradley's Gal,

987
01:01:56,508 --> 01:01:58,844
and we'll throw this one
for you, my friend.

988
01:01:58,877 --> 01:02:00,379
He would do that for you?

989
01:02:00,412 --> 01:02:02,247
[Sir Blake]
Yes, I would do anything

990
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:04,249
my friend Ace asked me to do.

991
01:02:04,282 --> 01:02:08,487
We go way back to when we were
just colts in Wellington Farms.

992
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:10,422
Okay, Bradley's Gal to win.

993
01:02:10,455 --> 01:02:12,324
And thank yous!

994
01:02:12,357 --> 01:02:14,292
So you are talking to the horse.

995
01:02:15,527 --> 01:02:18,864
You could talk to a horse?
Cool.

996
01:02:18,897 --> 01:02:20,599
[Ace]
Wish you could hear me, Daniel.

997
01:02:20,632 --> 01:02:23,669
Calm down.
Trust me, it's gonna work!

998
01:02:23,702 --> 01:02:27,606
That's the same thing you said when
your uncle gave you that "sure thing".

999
01:02:27,639 --> 01:02:31,877
- Where did that get ya?
- That was different.

1000
01:02:31,910 --> 01:02:34,513
Yeah, now you're getting betting
advice from a damn horse!

1001
01:02:34,546 --> 01:02:36,815
[Daniel]
Ooh, you swore, Mom!

1002
01:02:36,848 --> 01:02:40,953
Now you gotta put five bucks in the
cussing jar as soon as you get home.

1003
01:02:40,987 --> 01:02:43,755
I'm sorry, sweetie.
I know that was very bad of Mommy.

1004
01:02:43,789 --> 01:02:46,925
Not as bad as Tony bringing
us here and wasting our time.

1005
01:02:46,959 --> 01:02:50,729
It's not a waste of time.
Ace says it's a sure thing!

1006
01:02:50,762 --> 01:02:52,864
Plus, I don't have
any other options.

1007
01:02:52,898 --> 01:02:56,668
You're listening to a horse
who you supposedly hear speak.

1008
01:02:56,702 --> 01:02:58,537
Excuse me for being
a bit skeptical.

1009
01:02:58,570 --> 01:03:01,907
Look, let's just make
a test bet, okay.

1010
01:03:01,941 --> 01:03:04,977
Nothing crazy, all right?

1011
01:03:05,011 --> 01:03:07,479
If he loses, we go home.

1012
01:03:09,614 --> 01:03:10,615
Fair enough?

1013
01:03:10,649 --> 01:03:12,517
That sounds fair to me.

1014
01:03:12,551 --> 01:03:15,320
Are you kidding me?
Don't encourage him!

1015
01:03:15,353 --> 01:03:18,924
He needs a psychiatrist.
We all need to go home.

1016
01:03:18,958 --> 01:03:21,326
Come on, let's just go
and get some lunch.

1017
01:03:21,359 --> 01:03:23,762
C'mon, Daniel,
I bet you're hungry.

1018
01:03:23,795 --> 01:03:25,363
I'll race ya!

1019
01:03:25,397 --> 01:03:26,631
Daniel.

1020
01:03:26,665 --> 01:03:28,867
Oh, never mind!

1021
01:03:31,570 --> 01:03:33,872
I'm gonna go
place the test bet.

1022
01:03:33,905 --> 01:03:35,607
It seems like
I don't have any other option.

1023
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:38,343
What about
that Christmas miracle

1024
01:03:38,376 --> 01:03:39,811
that you said
you've been praying for?

1025
01:03:39,845 --> 01:03:42,848
It could happen,
if you believe.

1026
01:03:45,383 --> 01:03:46,618
Whatever, Tony.

1027
01:03:50,089 --> 01:03:53,325
- [Ace] Skeptics be gone!

How do you expect to get ahead
by betting like this?

1036

And all of this on the word
of a so-called talking horse?

1037
01:04:19,051 --> 01:04:21,620
And not only that, the only guy
that can hear him talk

1038
01:04:21,653 --> 01:04:23,321

who butted heads with him.

1039

I believe in him.

- How much did you bet?
- Well, not too much.

1077
01:06:21,073 --> 01:06:25,011
It was a test bet, but I bet on
Mother's Favorite Son to win,

01:12:53,565 --> 01:12:55,200
Well, how 'bout you?

1196
01:12:55,234 --> 01:12:57,536
Any special lady in your life?

1197
01:12:59,338 --> 01:13:03,208
Huh, the only lady
in my life is lady luck,

1198
01:13:03,242 --> 01:13:05,910
and she's dealt me
a very cruel blow.

1199
01:13:05,944 --> 01:13:07,346
[laughs]

1200
01:13:09,515 --> 01:13:12,151
What about you?
Anybody special?

1201
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:18,324
Well, I was... I was married,

1202
01:13:18,357 --> 01:13:22,061
and I thought it'd be forever,
with Daniel's Dad.

1203
01:13:23,495 --> 01:13:25,597
But that ended pretty badly.

1204
01:13:26,598 --> 01:13:28,866
A lot of lying and cheating.

1205
01:13:30,936 --> 01:13:36,475
And I was so anxious
to get full custody of my son

1206
01:13:36,508 --> 01:13:40,179
that I signed the divorce papers
without even reading them.

1207
01:13:41,680 --> 01:13:45,250
I signed away everything,

1208
01:13:45,284 --> 01:13:48,220
and I have been
struggling ever since.

1209
01:13:48,253 --> 01:13:51,223
I'm really sorry that you
had to go through that.

1210
01:13:51,256 --> 01:13:55,427
I'm just still so mad

1211
01:13:55,461 --> 01:13:58,497
that he wrecked my
happily ever after.

1212
01:13:58,530 --> 01:14:02,568
It's not healthy
to keep those feelings inside.

1213
01:14:02,601 --> 01:14:06,171
You're gonna lecture me
on unhealthy feelings?

1214
01:14:06,205 --> 01:14:08,107
I know, I know.

1215
01:14:08,140 --> 01:14:12,611
Tony, you can't
get ahead in life

1216
01:14:12,644 --> 01:14:15,381
because you are
constantly gambling away

1217
01:14:15,414 --> 01:14:17,216
every good thing
in your life.

1218
01:14:19,318 --> 01:14:23,589
You need to invest
into what's important to you

1219
01:14:23,622 --> 01:14:26,358
and stop trying to win
the easy way.

1220
01:14:26,392 --> 01:14:28,293
You-you're involved in it, too.

1221
01:14:28,327 --> 01:14:33,198
True, but it's not
gonna be forever.

1222
01:14:33,232 --> 01:14:35,134
It was a one and done for me.

1223
01:14:35,167 --> 01:14:39,638
It can go on forever
with Ace by my side.

1224
01:14:39,671 --> 01:14:42,408
That horse knows
what he's talking about.

1225
01:14:44,676 --> 01:14:46,278
He does.

1226
01:14:46,311 --> 01:14:49,047
You don't believe me,
do you?

1227
01:14:49,081 --> 01:14:50,516
No.

1228
01:14:52,718 --> 01:14:55,154
I believe in you, Tony.

1229
01:14:55,187 --> 01:14:56,955
Well, I don't, Amanda.

1230
01:14:56,989 --> 01:14:59,191
I'm nothing without that horse.

1231
01:15:01,226 --> 01:15:03,295
You are just like Brandon.

1232
01:15:03,328 --> 01:15:06,031
- [chuckles]
- Maybe.

1233
01:15:07,566 --> 01:15:12,404
I wouldn't mind being like that.
I mean, look at this place.

1234
01:15:12,438 --> 01:15:17,276
This is all a facade.
Brandon's in debt.

1235
01:15:17,309 --> 01:15:21,013
He's been selling off assets
left and right.

1236
01:15:21,046 --> 01:15:22,648
Racing Ace
against Renzoni's horse

1237
01:15:22,681 --> 01:15:27,019
is his last ditch effort to
hold onto anything. Trust me.

1238
01:15:28,420 --> 01:15:31,089
You do not
want to be like Brandon.

1239
01:15:34,259 --> 01:15:35,661
Just be Tony.

1240
01:15:37,029 --> 01:15:39,264
Mom, I had a nightmare.

1241
01:15:39,298 --> 01:15:42,534
Okay, sweetie, I'm sorry.
Let me take you back to bed.

1242
01:16:04,223 --> 01:16:06,058
[crickets chirping]

1243
01:16:13,432 --> 01:16:16,602
[Ace] You okay?
Why such a long face, Tony?

1244
01:16:16,635 --> 01:16:18,737
What's got you troubled?

1245
01:16:18,770 --> 01:16:21,173
I don't know
what I'm gonna do with my life.

1246
01:16:21,206 --> 01:16:23,742
[Ace] Well, maybe that's why
you met me.

1247
01:16:23,775 --> 01:16:25,177
What do you mean?

1248
01:16:25,210 --> 01:16:26,512
[Ace] Maybe I'm here to show you

1249
01:16:26,545 --> 01:16:28,313
that you aren't a loser.

1250
01:16:28,347 --> 01:16:29,715
I mean, ever since you met me

1251
01:16:29,748 --> 01:16:32,751
you've been
a pretty big winner, right?

1252
01:16:32,784 --> 01:16:34,586
Yeah, for now.

1253
01:16:34,620 --> 01:16:37,456
But what happens when
you're not around anymore?

1254
01:16:37,489 --> 01:16:40,192
[Ace] You don't need me
to be a winner, Tony.

1255
01:16:40,225 --> 01:16:41,527
You always were.

1256
01:16:41,560 --> 01:16:44,263
You just needed to
see it first-hand.

1257
01:16:44,296 --> 01:16:48,667
Now you have.
Now you know it.

1258
01:16:48,700 --> 01:16:52,437
So, do you think
I should keep gambling?

1259
01:16:52,471 --> 01:16:54,640
[Ace] I didn't say that, Tony.

1260
01:16:54,673 --> 01:16:57,409
Gambling can only
make things worse.

1261
01:16:57,442 --> 01:17:00,145
Sometimes it's better
to bet on yourself,

1262
01:17:00,178 --> 01:17:03,282
instead of an animal getting
ridden by some little guy

1263
01:17:03,315 --> 01:17:06,485
whipping it's back end
around the track.

1264
01:17:06,518 --> 01:17:10,722
Wow, Ace, that's exactly
what I needed to hear.

1265
01:17:10,756 --> 01:17:13,825
[Ace] Of course,
what are friends for?

1266
01:17:13,859 --> 01:17:18,564
Hey, Ace,
do you mind if I sleep here?

1267
01:17:18,597 --> 01:17:21,466
[Ace] What?
You wanna lay in the muck?

1268
01:17:22,401 --> 01:17:23,735
Yeah, I do.

1269
01:17:23,769 --> 01:17:26,104
[Ace] Well, at least
use my blanket.

1270
01:17:32,844 --> 01:17:36,281
Night, Tony, sweet dreams.

1271
01:17:37,749 --> 01:17:39,351
[snoring]

1272
01:17:39,384 --> 01:17:41,320
[Ace]
Uh-oh, this can't be good.

1273
01:17:44,356 --> 01:17:46,458
- What the heck!
- What the heck is right.

1274
01:17:46,491 --> 01:17:49,394
Who the heck are you?
And what are you doing in my stables?

1275
01:17:49,428 --> 01:17:51,530
Your stables?

1276
01:17:54,499 --> 01:17:55,467
Brandon.

1277
01:17:55,500 --> 01:17:57,402
How the heck
do you know my name?

1278
01:17:58,837 --> 01:18:00,439
I'm a good friend
of your sister.

1279
01:18:01,941 --> 01:18:03,175
Sister?

1280
01:18:03,208 --> 01:18:04,743
[Tony] Yeah, Amanda.

1281
01:18:04,776 --> 01:18:07,112
[Ace] Amanda's not his sister!

1282
01:18:13,251 --> 01:18:17,356
Oh, I'm sorry. How ya gonna get
yourself out of this mess, Tony?

1283
01:18:18,457 --> 01:18:20,158
[Dougie snoring]

1284
01:18:23,729 --> 01:18:24,796
Amanda!

1285
01:18:27,299 --> 01:18:28,500
Where the heck are ya?

1286
01:18:30,202 --> 01:18:32,804
Dad, Dad, I'm so glad you're home!
I missed you!

1287
01:18:32,838 --> 01:18:35,273
Hey, buddy, I missed you too.
Where's Mommy?

1288
01:18:37,909 --> 01:18:40,278
Did-did you just say Dad?

1289
01:18:40,312 --> 01:18:42,414
Yup, he's my Dad.

1290
01:18:42,447 --> 01:18:46,485
Have you met Mom's
new book club friend, Tony?

1291
01:18:46,518 --> 01:18:49,354
And his friend Dougie.
He runs funny.

1292
01:18:51,289 --> 01:18:54,526
Brandon,
what are you doing here?

1293
01:18:54,559 --> 01:18:56,461
- What am I doing here?
- Yeah.

1294
01:18:56,495 --> 01:18:57,829
What are you doing here?

1295
01:18:57,863 --> 01:18:59,898
You were supposed to
get your stuff and leave.

1296
01:18:59,932 --> 01:19:01,733
And who are these two?

1297
01:19:03,802 --> 01:19:05,437
Do me a favor, buddy,
go upstairs.

1298
01:19:05,470 --> 01:19:06,939
Mommy and Daddy have to
have a talk right now.

1299
01:19:06,973 --> 01:19:08,507
But you only just got here.

1300
01:19:08,540 --> 01:19:09,841
I know, I know.
I'll see you soon.

1301
01:19:09,875 --> 01:19:11,543
It's okay, sweetie,
go up to your room.

1302
01:19:15,347 --> 01:19:19,317
- Daddy?
- I can explain.

1303
01:19:19,351 --> 01:19:21,753
You were supposed to be
gone the whole week.

1304
01:19:21,787 --> 01:19:24,523
Yeah, well, my conference
ended early, okay.

1305
01:19:24,556 --> 01:19:27,459
And never mind me.
Again, who are these two?

1306
01:19:28,927 --> 01:19:31,697
Amanda, what-what's going on?

1307
01:19:31,730 --> 01:19:34,866
- I can explain.
- Yeah, Amanda, explain.

1308
01:19:38,503 --> 01:19:40,272
Brandon's not my brother.

1309
01:19:42,541 --> 01:19:44,576
- He's my husband.
- Ex-husband.

1310
01:19:46,344 --> 01:19:49,648
- What?
- I'm so sorry I lied.

1311
01:19:49,681 --> 01:19:51,583
But, but, but you...

1312
01:19:51,616 --> 01:19:54,419
What-what about Ace
and the race?

1313
01:19:54,453 --> 01:19:55,921
Ace doesn't have a race.

1314
01:19:56,956 --> 01:19:59,658
Amanda, you said to me

1315
01:19:59,691 --> 01:20:02,828
to hold Ace until...
until we get the ransom?

1316
01:20:02,861 --> 01:20:04,262
Ransom!

1317
01:20:05,932 --> 01:20:07,532
Tony, listen...

1318
01:20:07,566 --> 01:20:09,434
I've heard enough, okay.

1319
01:20:09,468 --> 01:20:11,336
That's it, I'm out of here!

1320
01:20:14,706 --> 01:20:16,608
What's with all the yelling?

1321
01:20:20,645 --> 01:20:23,448
And who is this
tall drink of water?

1322
01:20:23,482 --> 01:20:25,017
Amanda's brother, I presume?

1323
01:20:27,719 --> 01:20:28,754
No.

1324
01:20:29,921 --> 01:20:31,356
It's her husband.

1325
01:20:31,389 --> 01:20:33,025
Ex-husband.

1326
01:20:33,059 --> 01:20:36,394
Wait, Amanda
married her brother?

1327
01:20:36,428 --> 01:20:38,630
Does Daniel know this?

1328
01:20:38,663 --> 01:20:41,366
Are you the kid's father
or his uncle?

1329
01:20:41,399 --> 01:20:43,902
You two, out of my house now!

1330
01:20:43,936 --> 01:20:46,705
- And you, you better start...
- [Ace] <i>I just don't understand</i>

1331
01:20:46,738 --> 01:20:50,575
<i>what could have driven her to come up
with a scheme to have me kidnapped!</i>

1332
01:20:50,609 --> 01:20:52,811
<i>And this new
friend of hers, Tony,</i>

1333
01:20:52,844 --> 01:20:54,746
<i>he's not such a bad guy.</i>

1334
01:20:54,780 --> 01:20:56,715
<i>Just a little mixed up, too.</i>

1335
01:20:57,916 --> 01:21:00,318
Here you go, Big Freddie.

1336
01:21:00,352 --> 01:21:02,054
Fifty-thousand bananas!

1337
01:21:02,088 --> 01:21:05,024
Ho, ho, ho.

1338
01:21:05,057 --> 01:21:06,959
Look what Santa brought me.

1339
01:21:08,127 --> 01:21:12,031
Don't tell me Uncle Vito
came through.

1340
01:21:13,865 --> 01:21:17,636
No. No, not really, Ace. Hm.

1341
01:21:18,770 --> 01:21:19,771
Who?

1342
01:21:19,805 --> 01:21:21,673
Yeah, never mind.

1343
01:21:21,706 --> 01:21:27,046
You know, Tony,
I always knew you had it in you.

1344
01:21:28,647 --> 01:21:30,983
And I'm glad you did
the right thing.

1345
01:21:35,154 --> 01:21:37,422
She wasn't that
great of a chick anyway.

1346
01:21:37,455 --> 01:21:39,758
Don't let her get you down!

1347
01:21:39,791 --> 01:21:42,327
She played me like a fool.

1348
01:21:43,628 --> 01:21:46,098
I thought we had
some kind of connection.

1349
01:21:46,132 --> 01:21:51,037
She just used me to get back at
her ridiculously handsome husband.

1350
01:21:51,070 --> 01:21:53,538
- Ex.
- Whatever.

1351
01:21:55,674 --> 01:21:58,443
Here you guys go.
Compliments of your Uncle Vito.

1352
01:21:59,544 --> 01:22:01,113
Thank yous.

1353
01:22:01,147 --> 01:22:03,115
Hey, man,
look on the bright side.

1354
01:22:03,149 --> 01:22:04,850
At least you
got yourself out of debt.

1355
01:22:05,884 --> 01:22:07,086
You made more money

1356
01:22:07,119 --> 01:22:08,653
then you can
ever spend in a lifetime.

1357
01:22:09,855 --> 01:22:11,823
Well, maybe not in a lifetime.

1358
01:22:11,857 --> 01:22:14,026
And you found out
you could talk to a horse!

1359
01:22:15,127 --> 01:22:17,729
Yeah, but was it real?

1360
01:22:17,762 --> 01:22:19,631
Or was it all in my head?

1361
01:22:19,664 --> 01:22:23,035
Of course it was real.
I watched it happen.

1362
01:22:23,069 --> 01:22:25,537
I watched us win
the million dollar purse

1363
01:22:25,570 --> 01:22:27,974
on the horse that Ace
told you to bet on.

1364
01:22:28,007 --> 01:22:30,009
How else could we have made
all those winnings?

1365
01:22:30,042 --> 01:22:32,044
Maybe it was just luck.

1366
01:22:34,646 --> 01:22:38,683
I must've convinced myself
that a horse was talking to me.

1367
01:22:38,717 --> 01:22:42,487
To give me the confidence
to make risky bets.

1368
01:22:47,525 --> 01:22:48,995
Eh.

1369
01:22:50,129 --> 01:22:51,696
Where are you going?

1370
01:22:51,730 --> 01:22:53,132
I'll see ya later.

1371
01:22:58,004 --> 01:23:00,739
Good afternoon, sir.
How are you today?

1372
01:23:00,772 --> 01:23:02,641
I'd like to place a bet.

1373
01:23:02,674 --> 01:23:07,812
Race number five, horse number
two, please and thank yous.

1374
01:23:07,846 --> 01:23:09,115
Perfect.

1375
01:23:09,148 --> 01:23:10,849
Okay, and how much
would you like to wager?

1376
01:23:10,882 --> 01:23:13,551
- Fifty-thousand.
- Wonderful.

1377
01:23:13,585 --> 01:23:15,021
And...

1378
01:23:15,955 --> 01:23:17,856
[phone ringing]

1379
01:23:25,131 --> 01:23:27,632
You can't get ahead in life
because you are

1380
01:23:27,666 --> 01:23:31,137
constantly gambling away
every good thing in your life.

1381
01:23:33,239 --> 01:23:37,977
You need to invest
into what's important to you.

1382
01:23:39,145 --> 01:23:42,514
[man] Sir? Mr. Romano.

1383
01:23:42,547 --> 01:23:43,515
Mr. Romano, are you okay?

1384
01:23:43,548 --> 01:23:45,650
Yeah, I'm okay.

1385
01:23:45,684 --> 01:23:47,719
Um, never mind on the bet.

1386
01:23:49,188 --> 01:23:50,522
Okay.

1387
01:24:06,538 --> 01:24:12,278
What, you got another ex-husband
with a puppy you want gone?

1388
01:24:12,311 --> 01:24:15,847
Look, I am so sorry
that I lied about Brandon.

1389
01:24:15,880 --> 01:24:16,949
Why did you?

1390
01:24:16,983 --> 01:24:19,285
'Cause I thought you'd just...

1391
01:24:19,318 --> 01:24:21,720
I thought you wouldn't help me
if you knew the truth.

1392
01:24:21,753 --> 01:24:26,025
You were willing to go that far
with an innocent horse,

1393
01:24:26,058 --> 01:24:28,294
just to get back with your ex?

1394
01:24:28,327 --> 01:24:30,929
We all have our issues, Tony.

1395
01:24:30,963 --> 01:24:34,266
And Brandon's mine,
he drives me crazy.

1396
01:24:37,269 --> 01:24:39,171
That's not the half of it.

1397
01:24:41,007 --> 01:24:46,911
Brandon was a terrible...
terrible husband and father.

1398
01:24:47,980 --> 01:24:49,982
He didn't even wanna have kids.

1399
01:24:52,218 --> 01:24:54,586
But when Daniel came,

1400
01:24:54,619 --> 01:24:57,189
he was just
the best surprise ever.

1401
01:24:57,223 --> 01:25:01,093
And now that kid,
he is the apple of my eye.

1402
01:25:03,062 --> 01:25:08,067
And when I finally decided that
I wanted to file for divorce,

1403
01:25:08,100 --> 01:25:12,670
he had all the high-powered
lawyers and I had nothing.

1404
01:25:12,704 --> 01:25:16,008
But all I wanted was my son.

1405
01:25:16,042 --> 01:25:18,910
You had good intentions,
Amanda.

1406
01:25:18,944 --> 01:25:20,712
Take care of your son.

1407
01:25:22,214 --> 01:25:26,684
Well, I came here to apologize

1408
01:25:26,718 --> 01:25:29,021
for this mess
that I got you into

1409
01:25:29,055 --> 01:25:31,957
and to just tell you
why I did what I did.

1410
01:25:33,359 --> 01:25:36,962
Don't be sorry,
because out of this mess,

1411
01:25:36,996 --> 01:25:41,333
as you call it,
we became friends.

1412
01:25:43,802 --> 01:25:44,869
Right?

1413
01:25:47,173 --> 01:25:49,808
Right. [chuckles]

1414
01:25:49,841 --> 01:25:53,845
There's a lot of good I can do
with these race winnings.

1415
01:25:53,878 --> 01:25:55,381
And I will.

1416
01:25:55,414 --> 01:25:57,649
I owe it all to Ace.

1417
01:25:57,682 --> 01:26:03,655
So, in a way,
I'm grateful for what you did.

1418
01:26:03,688 --> 01:26:07,226
It really feels like
a Christmas miracle, Amanda.

1419
01:26:07,259 --> 01:26:13,798
Tony, that's so great.
I am so proud of you.
