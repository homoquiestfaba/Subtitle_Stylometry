1
00:02:11,236 --> 00:02:12,337
Stay awake.

2
00:02:13,807 --> 00:02:14,807
Okay.

3
00:03:08,194 --> 00:03:09,195
Oh, come on!

4
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:45,290
Afternoon.

5
00:04:52,298 --> 00:04:54,725
Hope you don't mind me
making myself comfortable.

6
00:04:54,767 --> 00:04:56,493
Are you an American?

7
00:04:56,535 --> 00:04:57,535
Yes, ma'am.

8
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,242
What are you doing here?

9
00:05:07,347 --> 00:05:08,239
You German?

10
00:05:08,281 --> 00:05:09,874
What are you doing here?

11
00:05:09,916 --> 00:05:11,108
Crashed.

12
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,714
What is your name?

13
00:05:16,756 --> 00:05:17,615
Jonathan.

14
00:05:17,657 --> 00:05:18,657
Jonathan what?

15
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:23,087
Danger. My name is
Jonathan Danger, ma'am.

16
00:05:23,129 --> 00:05:25,890
What division of the Third
Reich you soldiers from?

17
00:05:25,932 --> 00:05:27,390
The Third Reich.

18
00:05:27,432 --> 00:05:30,493
It's 1985, the
glory days are gone.

19
00:05:30,535 --> 00:05:32,395
Berlin belongs to the Soviets.

20
00:05:32,437 --> 00:05:34,374
We sadly now work
for Mother Russia.

21
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:38,736
Danger is a most
unusual name, is it not?

22
00:05:38,778 --> 00:05:40,171
Is it your real name?

23
00:05:40,213 --> 00:05:41,471
Sure.

24
00:05:41,513 --> 00:05:43,153
What are you doing
all the way out here,

25
00:05:43,182 --> 00:05:45,018
20 miles off the
coast of Africa?

26
00:05:46,418 --> 00:05:47,630
You know, I didn't know
anybody knew about this place.

27
00:05:47,654 --> 00:05:50,748
I paid a guy to fly over
and I parachuted in.

28
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:51,967
And how were you planning to get

29
00:05:51,991 --> 00:05:53,851
off the island, Mr. Danger?

30
00:05:53,893 --> 00:05:56,087
Oh, please, call
me Jonathan, ma'am.

31
00:05:56,129 --> 00:05:57,788
And you can call me Miss Fritz.

32
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:00,324
Ella Fritz, if we get along.

33
00:06:00,366 --> 00:06:02,567
How were you planning
to get off the island?

34
00:06:03,435 --> 00:06:05,329
I've got an exit strategy.

35
00:06:05,371 --> 00:06:06,371
Do you now?

36
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,640
I do.

37
00:06:09,409 --> 00:06:11,468
So we have the how,

38
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:14,305
but what we don't have
is the what or the why.

39
00:06:14,347 --> 00:06:16,641
So you'll have to
excuse my bluntness,

40
00:06:16,683 --> 00:06:19,176
what are you doing
here and why?!

41
00:06:22,956 --> 00:06:24,767
You know, I do like a girl
who's straight to the point.

42
00:06:24,791 --> 00:06:26,217
Are you a spy?

43
00:06:26,259 --> 00:06:29,987
Spy, no, no, no.
I'm a entrepreneur.

44
00:06:30,029 --> 00:06:32,899
I will not ask again,
what are you doing here?!

45
00:06:34,566 --> 00:06:36,394
That is a tough
question to answer

46
00:06:36,436 --> 00:06:39,563
and even harder question
to answer quickly.

47
00:06:39,605 --> 00:06:41,207
Can you toss me those matches?

48
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:55,455
You have 30 seconds.

49
00:06:56,956 --> 00:06:58,349
Go.

50
00:06:58,391 --> 00:06:59,216
30 Seconds?

51
00:06:59,258 --> 00:07:00,258
28 now.

52
00:07:01,461 --> 00:07:03,172
My family's in the business
of finding the exotic

53
00:07:03,196 --> 00:07:04,789
and selling it to the wealthy.

54
00:07:04,831 --> 00:07:05,923
The exotic?

55
00:07:05,965 --> 00:07:07,158
Yeah, the exotic.

56
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,811
You know, the bizarre,
the strange, the exotic.

57
00:07:08,835 --> 00:07:11,228
You know, wealthy love
that sort of thing.

58
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:13,631
You just have to be willing
to go places they're not.

59
00:07:13,673 --> 00:07:16,000
Find it, bring it back.

60
00:07:16,042 --> 00:07:19,403
Sounds like you want to be
Indiana Smith when you grow up.

61
00:07:19,445 --> 00:07:20,671
Jones.

62
00:07:20,713 --> 00:07:21,872
It's Indiana...

63
00:07:21,914 --> 00:07:22,914
Never mind.

64
00:07:26,352 --> 00:07:29,413
Oh, Jonathan,
how naughty of you.

65
00:07:29,455 --> 00:07:31,415
Chances are, I'll get
at least one of you.

66
00:07:31,457 --> 00:07:32,524
But only one of us.

67
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:36,796
Tell Hans to put his down
and I'll put mine down.

68
00:07:40,532 --> 00:07:43,094
His is bigger than
yours, is it not?

69
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,834
It's not about the size.

70
00:07:49,876 --> 00:07:51,144
Trust me, it is.

71
00:07:58,951 --> 00:08:00,111
You shot him!

72
00:08:00,153 --> 00:08:01,812
Oh, please, that's
just a scratch.

73
00:08:01,854 --> 00:08:04,390
He'll be fine as long as
he doesn't go for it again.

74
00:08:05,557 --> 00:08:07,118
I take it the keys
are in the jeep?

75
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,019
What?

76
00:08:08,061 --> 00:08:10,388
Ze keys to ze jeep.

77
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:12,423
You can't have our jeep!

78
00:08:12,465 --> 00:08:13,933
I wasn't asking permission.

79
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:19,539
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah,
wouldn't do that.

80
00:08:31,284 --> 00:08:33,077
Shoot it, shoot it, shoot it!

81
00:09:06,752 --> 00:09:08,212
I'm not.

82
00:09:49,061 --> 00:09:50,654
Come on.

83
00:09:50,696 --> 00:09:51,696
Stay awake.

84
00:10:17,823 --> 00:10:20,985
Daddy, I love you.

85
00:10:21,027 --> 00:10:22,621
Daddy!

86
00:10:26,999 --> 00:10:27,999
Come on.

87
00:10:30,637 --> 00:10:31,829
So close.

88
00:12:01,227 --> 00:12:02,227
American!

89
00:12:03,129 --> 00:12:04,421
And I hate commies!

90
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,816
What's the matter,
Ivan? Vodka withdrawals?

91
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:28,820
What?!

92
00:12:29,522 --> 00:12:30,715
I said...

93
00:12:30,757 --> 00:12:33,450
Hey. Are you having
vodka withdrawals?

94
00:12:33,492 --> 00:12:35,352
Yeah, I heard
you the first time!

95
00:12:35,394 --> 00:12:37,488
Well, then why'd you
say "what," you idiot?

96
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:39,857
Yeah 'cause it
didn't make any sense.

97
00:12:39,899 --> 00:12:42,293
Oh, so you don't like vodka?

98
00:12:42,335 --> 00:12:43,961
You think I'm Russian?

99
00:12:44,003 --> 00:12:45,262
You speak pretty good English

100
00:12:45,304 --> 00:12:46,665
for a KGB spy, you know that?

101
00:12:46,707 --> 00:12:48,841
I'm not a KGB spy.

102
00:12:50,209 --> 00:12:54,271
Oh, so you think I'm the
idiot? You think I'm the idiot?!

103
00:12:54,313 --> 00:12:55,313
I'm not.

104
00:12:56,650 --> 00:13:00,110
See that, that, is why you guys
are not gonna win this war.

105
00:13:00,152 --> 00:13:02,455
And we are gonna kick
your Russian asses!

106
00:13:04,123 --> 00:13:06,083
- What?
- Yeah, that's right,

107
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:08,986
the US of A, and
don't you forget it!

108
00:13:12,031 --> 00:13:14,458
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

109
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,060
You hurt your head there?

110
00:13:16,102 --> 00:13:18,797
You hit me with
the butt of your gun.

111
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:20,531
But that doesn't hurt
as bad as my ribs.

112
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:23,919
You actually didn't
hit me that hard.

113
00:13:23,943 --> 00:13:26,003
I knocked your
ass out, didn't I?

114
00:13:27,313 --> 00:13:29,506
Yeah, I can't give you
all the credit for that.

115
00:13:29,548 --> 00:13:31,442
That mostly has to do
with the tree branch.

116
00:13:31,484 --> 00:13:33,277
Oh, the tree branch.

117
00:13:33,319 --> 00:13:35,547
Yeah, yeah, when I landed.

118
00:13:35,589 --> 00:13:37,147
When you landed?

119
00:13:37,189 --> 00:13:38,849
What, so there are
more Russians, then?

120
00:13:38,891 --> 00:13:40,284
Is that what you're saying?

121
00:13:40,326 --> 00:13:43,822
Oh, for the love of
God, man, I'm American!

122
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:46,256
I bet you love baseball
and hot dogs, don't you?

123
00:13:46,298 --> 00:13:48,959
Yeah, yeah, I do, actually.

124
00:13:49,001 --> 00:13:50,427
Oh, that's good.

125
00:13:50,469 --> 00:13:53,097
That's good. Did they teach
you that in spy school?

126
00:13:53,139 --> 00:13:54,766
What spy school?

127
00:13:54,808 --> 00:13:56,367
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

128
00:13:56,409 --> 00:13:58,335
Loose lips sink ships, pal.

129
00:13:58,377 --> 00:14:00,705
What are you talking about?

130
00:14:00,747 --> 00:14:02,373
You and I are gonna sit here-

131
00:14:02,415 --> 00:14:04,216
I don't think he's a Russian.

132
00:14:05,518 --> 00:14:06,653
What happened to you?

133
00:14:08,053 --> 00:14:09,814
I'm getting closer.

134
00:14:09,856 --> 00:14:11,215
- Closer to what?
- Ah, ah, ah.

135
00:14:11,257 --> 00:14:13,359
You don't talk to
her. All right?

136
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:16,186
Put the knife down.

137
00:14:16,228 --> 00:14:18,122
He's obviously an American.

138
00:14:18,164 --> 00:14:20,958
Yeah, well, then why
is he in a Russian jeep?

139
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,836
I don't know. Did you ask him?

140
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:25,370
I didn't need to.

141
00:14:26,372 --> 00:14:28,265
Are you a Russian spy?

142
00:14:28,307 --> 00:14:30,134
I'm not supposed to talk to you.

143
00:14:30,176 --> 00:14:31,402
Oh, if you are,

144
00:14:31,444 --> 00:14:33,872
I am gonna gut you and
eat you for dinner.

145
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:35,906
Bet you taste like goulash.

146
00:14:35,948 --> 00:14:38,676
Forgive him. This
is my brother James.

147
00:14:38,718 --> 00:14:40,186
He's a little overprotective.

148
00:14:42,221 --> 00:14:44,181
Friends call me Jungle Jim.

149
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:45,367
Nice to meet you, Jungle Jim.

150
00:14:45,391 --> 00:14:48,352
You ain't a friend. All right?

151
00:14:48,394 --> 00:14:50,954
Well, some people call me
Jonathan. Jonathan Danger.

152
00:14:50,996 --> 00:14:53,457
I'm an American.

153
00:14:53,499 --> 00:14:56,427
I crashed in a Russian
camp about an hour ago.

154
00:14:56,469 --> 00:14:58,495
What are you doing
out here, Jonathan?

155
00:14:58,537 --> 00:15:01,165
Well, I stole
one of their jeeps.

156
00:15:01,207 --> 00:15:02,809
Problem is I didn't get too far.

157
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:04,602
I may have a punctured lung

158
00:15:04,644 --> 00:15:07,504
or some internal bleeding.

159
00:15:07,546 --> 00:15:09,239
What happened?

160
00:15:09,281 --> 00:15:11,609
A tree branch
went through my rib

161
00:15:11,651 --> 00:15:13,410
during my
not-so-awesome landing.

162
00:15:13,452 --> 00:15:14,597
- Let's see.
- No, no, no, he's bluffing.

163
00:15:14,621 --> 00:15:15,847
He's bluffing.

164
00:15:15,889 --> 00:15:17,882
No, no, I said
don't. He's bluffing.

165
00:15:17,924 --> 00:15:18,924
He's...

166
00:15:22,662 --> 00:15:23,982
Don't, don't,
don't, don't, don't.

167
00:15:24,898 --> 00:15:25,898
Ouch, ouch!

168
00:15:27,233 --> 00:15:28,560
Don't, don't, don't, don't.

169
00:15:28,602 --> 00:15:29,978
The blood's dry and
it's scabbed over.

170
00:15:30,002 --> 00:15:31,495
It's stuck to my shirt.

171
00:15:31,537 --> 00:15:34,039
I can't help you if I
can't see what's going on.

172
00:15:38,477 --> 00:15:39,956
Don't, don't,
don't, don't, don't.

173
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:52,049
Did you go through his stuff?

174
00:15:52,091 --> 00:15:53,492
Don't go through my stuff!

175
00:15:54,895 --> 00:15:56,663
All he had was this pack.

176
00:15:57,597 --> 00:15:58,665
What's this?

177
00:16:02,201 --> 00:16:03,202
That's Mr. Bear.

178
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:04,896
Mr. Bear?

179
00:16:04,938 --> 00:16:06,096
Yeah, that's Mr. Bear.

180
00:16:06,138 --> 00:16:07,841
Can you just put it
back in my bag, please?

181
00:16:09,441 --> 00:16:10,441
Why?

182
00:16:11,945 --> 00:16:14,446
Because if you don't,
I'll have to kill you.

183
00:16:19,552 --> 00:16:21,788
You'd have to kill me?

184
00:16:23,556 --> 00:16:25,148
It was my daughter's.

185
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:29,428
So yeah, if you don't put it
back, yeah, I'll kill you.

186
00:16:30,529 --> 00:16:32,933
You said was. Where's
your daughter now?

187
00:16:37,269 --> 00:16:38,269
She's dead.

188
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:44,276
Go search his jeep.

189
00:16:48,314 --> 00:16:49,314
Go.

190
00:17:01,861 --> 00:17:05,188
Well, he's a
breath of fresh air.

191
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:06,591
What's your name?

192
00:17:06,633 --> 00:17:08,735
Jade. Jade Calloway.

193
00:17:16,977 --> 00:17:18,578
I don't believe it.

194
00:17:20,179 --> 00:17:22,114
You really know where
it is, don't you?

195
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:25,785
This is a map of the island.

196
00:17:29,823 --> 00:17:31,223
You really know where it is.

197
00:17:32,157 --> 00:17:33,459
This is incredible.

198
00:17:34,628 --> 00:17:37,021
Oh, what the hell
are you doing, woman?

199
00:17:37,063 --> 00:17:39,122
It's not what it looks like.

200
00:17:39,164 --> 00:17:42,026
It looks like you're
taking his shirt off.

201
00:17:42,068 --> 00:17:43,595
Okay, then it is
what it looks like.

202
00:17:46,706 --> 00:17:47,717
Is there anyone
else in your group?

203
00:17:47,741 --> 00:17:50,267
Shh.

204
00:18:03,155 --> 00:18:04,082
How many more
people in your group?

205
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:05,124
Just me.

206
00:18:08,028 --> 00:18:10,555
All right, last
chance and be honest.

207
00:18:10,597 --> 00:18:13,290
Are you or are you
not a Russian spy?

208
00:18:13,332 --> 00:18:14,959
I'm not. I'm not.

209
00:18:15,001 --> 00:18:16,126
I'm not!
- All right, well,

210
00:18:16,168 --> 00:18:17,312
it was nice knowing you, buddy.

211
00:18:17,336 --> 00:18:18,528
We can't just leave him.

212
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:19,982
Yeah, yeah, you
can't just leave me.

213
00:18:20,006 --> 00:18:21,198
Why not?

214
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,718
Because he knows
where the temple is.

215
00:18:22,742 --> 00:18:24,969
You see these lines all over
his body? That's the map.

216
00:18:25,011 --> 00:18:27,038
He literally has it
tattooed across his skin.

217
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:30,675
We can finally find it
and get off this island.

218
00:18:30,717 --> 00:18:33,778
Oh, no.

219
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:36,047
Yes, yes, we need him.

220
00:18:36,089 --> 00:18:38,082
- I don't think so.
- We need him.

221
00:18:38,124 --> 00:18:39,124
No.

222
00:18:43,462 --> 00:18:44,254
Let's go.

223
00:18:44,296 --> 00:18:47,659
Can't just...

224
00:18:47,701 --> 00:18:49,393
Fine, have it your way.

225
00:18:55,909 --> 00:18:57,669
Come on, let's go!

226
00:18:57,711 --> 00:18:58,878
Hold my knife!

227
00:19:11,523 --> 00:19:12,592
Don't move.

228
00:19:17,063 --> 00:19:18,623
What are you doing?

229
00:19:18,665 --> 00:19:21,793
There's a revolver stuck
in the back of my pants,

230
00:19:21,835 --> 00:19:24,194
but I can't reach it without
giving away our position.

231
00:19:24,236 --> 00:19:25,730
Can you reach it?

232
00:19:25,772 --> 00:19:26,949
You want me to reach around you?

233
00:19:26,973 --> 00:19:28,733
Yeah. Grab my gun.

234
00:19:28,775 --> 00:19:30,601
- No.
- What?

235
00:19:30,643 --> 00:19:31,803
No.

236
00:19:31,845 --> 00:19:33,205
You wanna get
killed by Russians?

237
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:38,543
I told you to grab my gun, not
feel my up while you do it.

238
00:19:38,585 --> 00:19:41,179
I'm not trying to feel you up.

239
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:42,221
Got it?

240
00:19:47,894 --> 00:19:48,753
Pull the trigger!

241
00:19:48,795 --> 00:19:49,795
Again!

242
00:19:57,536 --> 00:19:58,763
Woo! Yeah!

243
00:19:58,805 --> 00:19:59,964
Sis!

244
00:20:00,006 --> 00:20:01,540
That was so rad!

245
00:20:02,942 --> 00:20:05,636
You think there's any
more Russians on the island?

246
00:20:05,678 --> 00:20:06,678
Yup.

247
00:20:26,498 --> 00:20:28,101
I gotta stop for a second.

248
00:20:43,415 --> 00:20:44,809
Hey!

249
00:20:44,851 --> 00:20:45,851
That's littering.

250
00:20:50,957 --> 00:20:52,324
Sorry about your daughter.

251
00:20:54,194 --> 00:20:57,588
It's okay, I'll
be seeing her soon.

252
00:20:57,630 --> 00:20:59,857
So you believe it's really here?

253
00:20:59,899 --> 00:21:01,358
I do.

254
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,169
And that it's not
really a temple?

255
00:21:04,469 --> 00:21:06,438
It's my only way back to 1982.

256
00:21:13,112 --> 00:21:14,112
This was hers.

257
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,480
Mr. Bear.

258
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:20,987
After the fire, it's the only
thing I have left of her.

259
00:21:22,454 --> 00:21:23,454
Oh, god.

260
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:28,928
Mr. Bear. Not a
very creative name.

261
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:43,142
When I gave it to her, she
asked me what his name was.

262
00:21:44,911 --> 00:21:45,911
That's what I said.

263
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:48,248
What was her name?

264
00:21:49,481 --> 00:21:50,481
Violet.

265
00:21:51,351 --> 00:21:52,451
Violet Monroe Fogg.

266
00:22:02,762 --> 00:22:04,563
Why wasn't her last name Danger?

267
00:22:05,832 --> 00:22:08,034
You're not sticking to
your story, comrade.

268
00:22:09,401 --> 00:22:11,596
Ow!

269
00:22:11,638 --> 00:22:13,873
I'm making sure that
he's not lying to us.

270
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:16,042
That's gonna bruise.

271
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:23,482
So, what's the plan?

272
00:22:25,218 --> 00:22:26,886
The plan is to follow your map.

273
00:22:28,187 --> 00:22:30,390
Why'd you do it?
Why the tattoos?

274
00:22:32,091 --> 00:22:33,584
I travel light.

275
00:22:33,626 --> 00:22:37,520
Figured this way, it'd be harder
for anyone to get the map.

276
00:22:38,765 --> 00:22:40,390
I don't know about that.

277
00:22:40,432 --> 00:22:42,727
Someone wanted that
map off of you,

278
00:22:42,769 --> 00:22:44,662
they could probably get it.

279
00:22:44,704 --> 00:22:47,031
Yeah, well, they'd
have to skin me.

280
00:22:47,073 --> 00:22:48,799
That's what I was getting at.

281
00:22:48,841 --> 00:22:51,535
Yeah, well, then
they'd have to kill me.

282
00:22:51,577 --> 00:22:54,238
That is also what
I was getting at.

283
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:57,474
Well, then I'd have no need
for the temple, now would I?

284
00:22:57,516 --> 00:22:58,516
I'd be dead.

285
00:23:00,887 --> 00:23:01,931
How are you planning on getting

286
00:23:01,955 --> 00:23:03,256
through all those soldiers?

287
00:23:05,692 --> 00:23:07,919
I didn't know they were here.

288
00:23:07,961 --> 00:23:09,162
Didn't know anybody was.

289
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:13,199
Locals on the mainland said
this island was uninhabited.

290
00:23:16,903 --> 00:23:18,503
So you think we should team up.

291
00:23:19,973 --> 00:23:20,973
What?!

292
00:23:21,007 --> 00:23:22,166
Yeah.

293
00:23:22,208 --> 00:23:23,551
See, you're clearly
in no condition

294
00:23:23,575 --> 00:23:25,903
to take out a bunch
of Russian soldiers,

295
00:23:25,945 --> 00:23:28,239
me and Jade are,
'cause we're bad asses.

296
00:23:28,281 --> 00:23:31,751
You got that map on you.
I think we should team up.

297
00:23:32,852 --> 00:23:35,246
Really? You were
just about to kill him.

298
00:23:35,288 --> 00:23:37,748
No, he's obviously not KGB.

299
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:38,790
Thank you!

300
00:23:39,625 --> 00:23:40,818
Sorry about, Jade.

301
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:42,787
She can be a little
suspicious sometimes.

302
00:23:42,829 --> 00:23:44,097
You're kidding.

303
00:23:51,437 --> 00:23:52,697
All right.

304
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:54,840
I'm ready to go.

305
00:23:56,541 --> 00:23:57,668
Let's keep moving.

306
00:23:57,710 --> 00:23:58,710
All right.

307
00:24:07,887 --> 00:24:08,887
What?

308
00:24:11,758 --> 00:24:12,950
Nothing.

309
00:24:12,992 --> 00:24:14,251
What?

310
00:24:14,293 --> 00:24:15,518
Oh, nothing. Nothing.

311
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:18,289
Are you okay?

312
00:24:20,266 --> 00:24:21,759
Are you okay?

313
00:24:21,801 --> 00:24:24,328
Yup! Just a little hard
to breathe, but I'm fine.

314
00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:25,596
I'm ready to go.

315
00:24:25,638 --> 00:24:27,774
You're in no shape to walk.

316
00:24:28,941 --> 00:24:30,935
Good night's rest
will do you some good.

317
00:24:30,977 --> 00:24:34,839
But my little girl,
she's waiting for me.

318
00:24:34,881 --> 00:24:37,375
If she's in 1982, she's fine.

319
00:24:37,417 --> 00:24:38,518
She doesn't even know.

320
00:24:40,386 --> 00:24:42,146
I guess you're right.

321
00:24:42,188 --> 00:24:43,956
I mean, it is
getting late, anyway.

322
00:24:45,224 --> 00:24:46,359
Should we start a fire?

323
00:24:47,393 --> 00:24:49,595
Nah, the Russians will see it.

324
00:24:50,897 --> 00:24:52,398
But but we can make s'mores.

325
00:24:56,436 --> 00:24:58,963
Come on, let's find a
place and hunker down.

326
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:50,314
Pardon me. Delano.

327
00:25:50,356 --> 00:25:52,091
Delano, I don't
have time for this.

328
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:55,895
Do you know what this is?

329
00:25:58,764 --> 00:26:00,500
I'm sure you're
going to tell me.

330
00:26:02,902 --> 00:26:03,902
It's cancer.

331
00:26:05,071 --> 00:26:08,508
Throat cancer to be exact,
caused by radiation,

332
00:26:09,942 --> 00:26:11,544
which means we're getting close.

333
00:26:12,979 --> 00:26:17,108
Wherever that temple is,
it's here, on this island,

334
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:18,351
and it's leaking energy.

335
00:26:19,519 --> 00:26:22,179
Leaking a tremendous
amount of energy.

336
00:26:22,221 --> 00:26:23,923
Most likely, it's
highly unstable.

337
00:26:25,558 --> 00:26:27,226
Wasn't he fine just a week ago?

338
00:26:29,562 --> 00:26:30,562
Yeah.

339
00:26:31,264 --> 00:26:32,264
He's dead now.

340
00:26:33,666 --> 00:26:35,226
This radiation
spreads more rapidly

341
00:26:35,268 --> 00:26:37,695
than anything I've
ever encountered.

342
00:26:37,737 --> 00:26:40,498
You need to find that temple
and you need to find it fast.

343
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:42,275
What do you think
I've been doing?

344
00:26:45,478 --> 00:26:47,705
A third American has arrived.

345
00:26:47,747 --> 00:26:49,974
Washington must know
it's here as well.

346
00:26:50,016 --> 00:26:52,552
So all the more reason for
you to hurry up and find it.

347
00:26:54,253 --> 00:26:56,989
Three Americans.
Isn't that strange?

348
00:27:01,662 --> 00:27:03,296
Are you questioning my loyalty?

349
00:27:07,733 --> 00:27:10,036
Because I wouldn't do
that, if I was you.

350
00:27:13,539 --> 00:27:14,539
German.

351
00:27:16,677 --> 00:27:18,669
You're quite the war hero.

352
00:27:18,711 --> 00:27:21,180
The great Delano Davis,
working for the Russians.

353
00:27:25,017 --> 00:27:26,719
That thing ain't gonna save you.

354
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,388
Most likely, we're
already infected.

355
00:27:31,557 --> 00:27:33,184
Go find my Geiger counter.

356
00:27:33,226 --> 00:27:34,226
Yes, sir!

357
00:27:39,165 --> 00:27:40,233
Damn, Nazi.

358
00:27:48,642 --> 00:27:50,701
Easy.

359
00:27:53,379 --> 00:27:54,438
What about over there?

360
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,907
Yeah.

361
00:27:56,949 --> 00:27:58,784
All right, I got it.

362
00:28:11,464 --> 00:28:12,965
So I told you my story.

363
00:28:14,533 --> 00:28:16,869
Why are the two of you
trying to reach the temple?

364
00:28:18,739 --> 00:28:19,739
No reason.

365
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:22,733
No reason?

366
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:24,844
You're kidding me, right?

367
00:28:26,279 --> 00:28:28,573
You had to travel around the
world to an uncharted island,

368
00:28:28,615 --> 00:28:30,808
20 miles off the
coast of Africa,

369
00:28:30,850 --> 00:28:32,952
to live in that ratty
tent I found you in.

370
00:28:34,721 --> 00:28:36,355
Nobody does that for no reason.

371
00:28:38,891 --> 00:28:39,891
Don't.

372
00:28:42,862 --> 00:28:43,862
Don't.

373
00:28:46,165 --> 00:28:47,509
You see that new movie,
"Back to the Future,"

374
00:28:47,533 --> 00:28:48,660
just came out?

375
00:28:48,702 --> 00:28:50,327
- Yeah.
- Yeah, you know the DeLorean,

376
00:28:50,369 --> 00:28:52,489
the new car where doors go?

377
00:28:56,542 --> 00:28:58,102
You know what I'm saying?

378
00:28:58,144 --> 00:28:59,169
Yeah.

379
00:28:59,211 --> 00:29:00,489
I said I saw the movie.
- Thank you.

380
00:29:00,513 --> 00:29:02,540
Well, instead of
going back in time

381
00:29:02,582 --> 00:29:04,074
and trying to bang his mom,

382
00:29:04,116 --> 00:29:07,444
Marty McFly should've
played the lotto.

383
00:29:07,486 --> 00:29:09,097
I got every single
lotto written down here

384
00:29:09,121 --> 00:29:10,556
from the last five years.

385
00:29:11,725 --> 00:29:13,045
Me and Jade are
gonna go get rich.

386
00:29:15,328 --> 00:29:16,220
Can I see those?

387
00:29:16,262 --> 00:29:17,462
Hell no, you can't see them!

388
00:29:23,202 --> 00:29:24,596
All right.

389
00:29:24,638 --> 00:29:29,375
So tomorrow, bright and
early, we head for the temple?

390
00:29:30,543 --> 00:29:31,543
Absolutely.

391
00:29:34,213 --> 00:29:36,982
Well, I'm taking it down.

392
00:29:46,058 --> 00:29:47,326
There's a rock there.

393
00:29:50,697 --> 00:29:52,398
It's really
comfortable, actually.

394
00:29:57,937 --> 00:29:59,129
Hold on.

395
00:29:59,171 --> 00:30:00,171
Hold on.

396
00:30:01,407 --> 00:30:03,610
Yeah, hold on a second.

397
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:07,580
There's a slant.

398
00:30:14,654 --> 00:30:15,654
You good?

399
00:30:16,922 --> 00:30:20,960
Yeah, I'm good, it's a little
noisy, with you jabbering.

400
00:30:22,928 --> 00:30:23,822
Maybe we should give him

401
00:30:23,864 --> 00:30:24,922
some space.
- Yeah.

402
00:30:24,964 --> 00:30:28,225
Come on.

403
00:30:28,267 --> 00:30:30,160
You two should get some sleep.

404
00:30:30,202 --> 00:30:32,396
Gonna be a bit of
a hike tomorrow.

405
00:31:17,416 --> 00:31:20,043
Your brother is
quite the character.

406
00:31:20,085 --> 00:31:21,085
Yeah.

407
00:31:23,956 --> 00:31:25,416
He's right, though.

408
00:31:25,458 --> 00:31:27,828
It's gonna be a bit of a
hike if your map's right.

409
00:31:28,961 --> 00:31:29,961
It is.

410
00:31:31,263 --> 00:31:34,893
Tell you what, this should
help us get some good sleep.

411
00:31:35,902 --> 00:31:37,428
You've been holding out on me.

412
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:38,470
Yup.

413
00:31:48,013 --> 00:31:49,273
I'm impressed.

414
00:31:49,315 --> 00:31:50,941
Yeah, growing up,
my parents were both

415
00:31:50,983 --> 00:31:52,976
basically functioning
alcoholics.

416
00:31:53,018 --> 00:31:54,344
Grew up with the stuff.

417
00:31:54,386 --> 00:31:55,647
Rum with the Cheerios, huh?

418
00:31:55,689 --> 00:31:57,582
Breakfast of champions.

419
00:31:57,624 --> 00:31:58,624
Me too.

420
00:32:04,029 --> 00:32:05,389
Your turn.

421
00:32:05,431 --> 00:32:06,431
Mm. Okay.

422
00:32:12,772 --> 00:32:15,466
That's not how we play.
You're not supposed to match me.

423
00:32:15,508 --> 00:32:16,988
You're supposed to
drink more than me.

424
00:32:26,252 --> 00:32:28,512
That's four. Now,
you got to do five.

425
00:32:28,554 --> 00:32:30,981
There's not even
five gulps in here.

426
00:32:31,023 --> 00:32:32,382
I could finish it.

427
00:32:32,424 --> 00:32:33,424
Do it.

428
00:32:40,566 --> 00:32:44,738
So, what are the two of
you really doing out here?

429
00:32:46,006 --> 00:32:47,006
What do you mean?

430
00:32:48,374 --> 00:32:50,602
Please, not that the lotto
idea is not a good one,

431
00:32:50,644 --> 00:32:53,370
but that's not why
you're really here.

432
00:32:53,412 --> 00:32:54,412
How do you know?

433
00:32:55,649 --> 00:32:57,140
I can tell.

434
00:32:57,182 --> 00:32:59,194
You don't come all the way out
here on a wing and a prayer,

435
00:32:59,218 --> 00:33:00,678
searching for a temple

436
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,722
that locals myths says
can take you back in time,

437
00:33:04,123 --> 00:33:05,825
not unless you've
lost everything.

438
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:08,160
And you've lost everything?

439
00:33:10,462 --> 00:33:11,462
Yeah.

440
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:15,568
Oh, I am starting to
feel that alcohol.

441
00:33:17,269 --> 00:33:18,663
Slow it down there, tiger.

442
00:33:21,173 --> 00:33:22,366
I'm sorry.

443
00:33:22,408 --> 00:33:23,753
I think I've just
lost a lot of blood,

444
00:33:23,777 --> 00:33:26,169
and I may or may not
have a punctured lung.

445
00:33:26,211 --> 00:33:27,672
I haven't eaten in
the last two days,

446
00:33:27,714 --> 00:33:30,182
and the alcohol has gotten
me just a little woozy.

447
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:32,376
Ouch.

448
00:33:32,418 --> 00:33:33,845
What?

449
00:33:33,887 --> 00:33:35,813
I just said slow it down.

450
00:33:35,855 --> 00:33:37,247
Now, you're acting
like the reason

451
00:33:37,289 --> 00:33:40,552
you just hit on me is because
you think you're dying.

452
00:33:40,594 --> 00:33:43,353
I just meant maybe
after another bottle.

453
00:33:43,395 --> 00:33:45,957
What, you have another bottle?

454
00:33:45,999 --> 00:33:46,925
Maybe.

455
00:33:46,967 --> 00:33:48,860
Maybe like yes or maybe like-

456
00:33:48,902 --> 00:33:50,895
Maybe like yes.

457
00:33:50,937 --> 00:33:52,931
But be warned, if you
try to hit on me again,

458
00:33:52,973 --> 00:33:54,608
my brother might kill you.

459
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:06,644
We're out of rum, but have
a little bit of whiskey.

460
00:34:06,686 --> 00:34:09,446
- Whiskey, oh, now we're-
- Shh, it's Jim's.

461
00:34:09,488 --> 00:34:10,690
Don't wanna wake him up.

462
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:19,122
You know, I realized you just
totally avoided my question.

463
00:34:19,164 --> 00:34:20,892
What was the question again?

464
00:34:20,934 --> 00:34:23,327
What are the two of
you really doing here?

465
00:34:23,369 --> 00:34:25,005
Ooh, back story.

466
00:34:27,172 --> 00:34:29,809
Come on. I told
you about Mr. Bear.

467
00:34:31,543 --> 00:34:32,543
Okay, fine.

468
00:34:33,813 --> 00:34:37,474
I know what's in the
temple. I know what it is.

469
00:34:37,516 --> 00:34:38,516
You do?

470
00:34:41,054 --> 00:34:42,088
It's not from here.

471
00:34:44,124 --> 00:34:46,993
You mean, like, from Earth?

472
00:34:47,927 --> 00:34:48,927
No, not like that.

473
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:51,830
Here.

474
00:34:57,837 --> 00:34:59,438
It's a file on the temple.

475
00:35:00,305 --> 00:35:01,440
Where'd you get this?

476
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:08,438
I stole it.

477
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,515
You stole it?

478
00:35:11,151 --> 00:35:12,409
From where?

479
00:35:12,451 --> 00:35:13,451
My dad.

480
00:35:14,788 --> 00:35:16,246
Wait.

481
00:35:16,288 --> 00:35:18,448
Your dad has a top secret
file on the government?

482
00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:19,490
Shh.

483
00:35:21,193 --> 00:35:23,362
I don't want Jungle
Jim over there to know.

484
00:35:24,931 --> 00:35:27,058
Why not?

485
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:28,826
'Cause our father
was court-martialed

486
00:35:28,868 --> 00:35:29,969
after it went missing.

487
00:35:31,203 --> 00:35:33,372
Locked him up,
threw away the key.

488
00:35:34,941 --> 00:35:36,634
Wait, you got
your dad locked up,

489
00:35:36,676 --> 00:35:38,343
and you had this
the entire time?

490
00:35:39,813 --> 00:35:41,957
Well, it's not like he was
the nicest guy in the world

491
00:35:41,981 --> 00:35:46,052
or won Dad of the Year
contests or anything like that.

492
00:35:47,553 --> 00:35:50,489
Actually think it'll do him
some good to have some me time.

493
00:35:52,992 --> 00:35:57,889
But if this thing is real
and we do go back in time,

494
00:35:57,931 --> 00:35:59,824
he won't have ever
served any jail time,

495
00:35:59,866 --> 00:36:03,094
so no harm, no foul, right?

496
00:36:03,136 --> 00:36:04,136
I guess so.

497
00:36:05,304 --> 00:36:07,406
Trust me, my logic is sound.

498
00:36:08,742 --> 00:36:09,533
Is it?

499
00:36:09,575 --> 00:36:10,575
Mm-hm.

500
00:36:12,812 --> 00:36:16,306
What's that?

501
00:36:18,952 --> 00:36:19,877
What's that mean?

502
00:36:19,919 --> 00:36:21,553
It means "Here be lions."

503
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:25,315
Why do you have that
tattooed on your wrist?

504
00:36:25,357 --> 00:36:26,918
It was on the map.

505
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,152
I got a bit drunk

506
00:36:28,194 --> 00:36:30,395
and I had the guy copy
it all down, so he did.

507
00:36:32,098 --> 00:36:33,833
Did you do all
of those yourself?

508
00:36:35,567 --> 00:36:36,736
Yeah, I did.

509
00:36:39,438 --> 00:36:42,934
They're not that bad, right?

510
00:36:42,976 --> 00:36:43,976
Yeah.

511
00:36:50,415 --> 00:36:51,415
Bottoms up.

512
00:38:20,073 --> 00:38:21,174
Ahem.

513
00:38:25,311 --> 00:38:26,311
What?

514
00:38:28,047 --> 00:38:29,883
You fornicate with
the Russian spy?

515
00:38:31,651 --> 00:38:32,651
Stop.

516
00:38:34,888 --> 00:38:38,124
Did you fornicate
with the Russian spy?

517
00:38:41,661 --> 00:38:43,054
No.

518
00:38:43,096 --> 00:38:45,189
'Cause that's the
oldest trick in the book.

519
00:38:45,231 --> 00:38:46,757
What is?

520
00:38:46,799 --> 00:38:48,926
It's called the
honey trap, all right?

521
00:38:48,968 --> 00:38:50,194
They seduce you.

522
00:38:50,236 --> 00:38:51,479
They get all your
secrets out of you

523
00:38:51,503 --> 00:38:53,206
when you're at your
most vulnerable.

524
00:38:54,573 --> 00:38:56,100
Don't be gross.

525
00:38:56,142 --> 00:38:59,103
Not gonna have sex with
you sleeping right there.

526
00:38:59,145 --> 00:39:00,589
I'm just saying, you
don't see me banging

527
00:39:00,613 --> 00:39:03,941
any Russian spies, do you?

528
00:39:03,983 --> 00:39:04,983
Shit.

529
00:39:06,252 --> 00:39:07,144
What is it?

530
00:39:07,186 --> 00:39:08,330
Come on, we gotta go!

531
00:39:09,521 --> 00:39:10,841
- What's he doing?!
- We gotta go.

532
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:24,161
Go, go, go!

533
00:39:28,775 --> 00:39:30,368
What did he say?

534
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:31,970
I think he wants us
to put our hands up.

535
00:39:33,445 --> 00:39:36,340
So you do speak Russian.
Oh, my god, Jim was right.

536
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:41,154
Honestly, I'm just guessing.

537
00:40:14,387 --> 00:40:15,746
We meet again.

538
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:17,281
I'm not sure about you,

539
00:40:17,323 --> 00:40:20,994
but I'm extremely pleased
by these circumstances.

540
00:40:24,563 --> 00:40:25,756
Wait outside.

541
00:40:25,798 --> 00:40:26,875
No one comes in,
no one comes out,

542
00:40:26,899 --> 00:40:28,759
unless it's myself or Delano.

543
00:40:28,801 --> 00:40:30,470
Affirmative.

544
00:40:36,142 --> 00:40:39,145
Who is your lovely
new girlfriend?

545
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:44,751
I thought he had something
very special, you and me.

546
00:40:45,918 --> 00:40:47,611
You swoop into a girl's life,

547
00:40:47,653 --> 00:40:50,614
and just as quickly, swoop out.

548
00:40:50,656 --> 00:40:53,818
You left me so distraught,
in such a mood,

549
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:56,162
that I killed my
young assistant Hans.

550
00:40:57,897 --> 00:41:01,359
You see, I was so heartbroken.

551
00:41:01,401 --> 00:41:03,936
And now you simply show up
again with another woman!

552
00:41:09,509 --> 00:41:10,510
And you.

553
00:41:14,047 --> 00:41:15,615
We've been keeping tabs on you

554
00:41:17,083 --> 00:41:20,077
to make sure you didn't find
the temple before we did it.

555
00:41:20,119 --> 00:41:24,290
But as you can see, we found
it quite fine on our own.

556
00:41:25,458 --> 00:41:27,960
We didn't even need
Mr. Danger to help us.

557
00:41:29,295 --> 00:41:31,464
It is Mr. Danger, is it not?

558
00:41:35,802 --> 00:41:37,228
I'm sorry, darling,

559
00:41:37,270 --> 00:41:39,270
I can't understand you with
that gag in your mouth.

560
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:43,601
I said, what are you doing here?

561
00:41:43,643 --> 00:41:44,969
Me or the Soviets?

562
00:41:45,011 --> 00:41:48,314
The Soviets. But
you're not KGB.

563
00:41:49,515 --> 00:41:53,477
No, we are part of the
Soviet Space Program.

564
00:41:54,987 --> 00:41:57,557
You want me to believe you're
all a bunch of cosmonauts?

565
00:41:59,392 --> 00:42:03,120
I think Winston
Churchill best described us

566
00:42:03,162 --> 00:42:08,067
as a riddle wrapped in a
mystery inside an enigma,

567
00:42:09,435 --> 00:42:12,772
which to my ears, sounds
rather sexy, don't you agree?

568
00:42:14,874 --> 00:42:17,101
So what are you looking for?

569
00:42:17,143 --> 00:42:18,811
Don't take me for stupid!

570
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:23,584
We're looking for the same
thing that you are looking for.

571
00:42:25,051 --> 00:42:27,453
The same thing I assume you're
looking for as well, my dear.

572
00:42:33,626 --> 00:42:35,661
I honestly don't see
what you see in her.

573
00:42:37,697 --> 00:42:41,234
But you, Mr. Danger, with
all of the tattoos...

574
00:42:46,239 --> 00:42:48,341
No need to flex
those muscles for me.

575
00:42:57,483 --> 00:42:59,218
It looks like playtime is over.

576
00:43:00,853 --> 00:43:03,289
Delano is our main doctor
here on the island.

577
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:08,652
I take it he's
gonna question us?

578
00:43:08,694 --> 00:43:10,096
Yes, that's right.

579
00:43:18,538 --> 00:43:19,538
Hello.

580
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,342
I assume you know
where the temple is.

581
00:43:25,244 --> 00:43:26,244
You're American?

582
00:43:27,648 --> 00:43:28,648
Yes, I am.

583
00:43:30,183 --> 00:43:32,552
And why do you think I
know where the temple is?

584
00:43:35,388 --> 00:43:37,190
'Cause of the
tattoo on your skin.

585
00:43:41,194 --> 00:43:42,286
So if you're American,

586
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:44,096
then why are you
working for the Soviets?

587
00:43:46,332 --> 00:43:48,334
After the end of
the Second World War,

588
00:43:49,468 --> 00:43:51,896
the United States
started recruiting Nazis

589
00:43:51,938 --> 00:43:53,306
for their science division.

590
00:43:55,107 --> 00:43:57,276
The same Nazis
that I lost my leg,

591
00:43:58,377 --> 00:44:00,446
and a bunch of my close
friends, fighting,

592
00:44:01,547 --> 00:44:02,616
and not just fighting,

593
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:05,850
killing.

594
00:44:07,253 --> 00:44:08,554
There's a big difference.

595
00:44:10,423 --> 00:44:12,024
We were sent over there to kill.

596
00:44:14,661 --> 00:44:19,065
When you're sent off to
kill, people get shot,

597
00:44:21,635 --> 00:44:23,704
people get blown up,

598
00:44:28,107 --> 00:44:29,408
people get changed.

599
00:44:42,589 --> 00:44:43,690
It's made of titanium.

600
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:46,660
Same thing a space
shuttle's made of.

601
00:44:47,827 --> 00:44:48,827
What happened?

602
00:44:52,398 --> 00:44:53,398
World War II.

603
00:44:57,604 --> 00:44:58,739
I was only 16.

604
00:45:00,139 --> 00:45:01,139
I was too young.

605
00:45:02,408 --> 00:45:04,977
But I told them I was 18,
ready and willing to fight.

606
00:45:06,345 --> 00:45:07,557
And they loved
the sound of that,

607
00:45:07,581 --> 00:45:09,106
so they signed me up
and shipped me out

608
00:45:09,148 --> 00:45:11,408
just as quickly as they could.

609
00:45:11,450 --> 00:45:14,945
You have any idea of
what a medical tent,

610
00:45:14,987 --> 00:45:19,825
on the front lines, over
in Berlin, looks like?

611
00:45:26,265 --> 00:45:30,604
I carried my commanding
officer on my shoulders

612
00:45:32,305 --> 00:45:35,007
three and a half miles to
the nearest medical tent

613
00:45:36,643 --> 00:45:39,111
with two bullets in me
from a goddamn Nazi.

614
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:42,381
You know what they told
me when I got there?

615
00:45:46,152 --> 00:45:48,254
I put my commanding
officer down on a cot.

616
00:45:49,723 --> 00:45:52,058
They took one look at my
leg, all shot to hell,

617
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:57,229
and they said, "We're
gonna have to amputate,"

618
00:45:58,331 --> 00:45:59,700
and took out the bone saws.

619
00:46:01,635 --> 00:46:04,537
No painkillers, no gauze,

620
00:46:07,006 --> 00:46:10,443
just the bone saws
and a bloody mess.

621
00:46:13,012 --> 00:46:15,740
That leg twitched for
nearly two minutes

622
00:46:15,782 --> 00:46:17,274
when they took it off.

623
00:46:17,316 --> 00:46:18,451
You're lying.

624
00:46:22,622 --> 00:46:24,056
After the war, I went home.

625
00:46:26,793 --> 00:46:28,327
Both of my brothers were dead,

626
00:46:30,363 --> 00:46:32,231
my girl married my best friend,

627
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:35,602
and I was missing a leg.

628
00:46:39,105 --> 00:46:41,708
Your government, you
know what they did?

629
00:46:44,811 --> 00:46:46,680
They put those
goddamn Nazis to work.

630
00:46:48,347 --> 00:46:49,649
Can you believe that shit?

631
00:46:50,817 --> 00:46:53,386
So, you went to go
work for the Russians?

632
00:46:57,990 --> 00:47:00,059
I'll admit I was a easy recruit.

633
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:03,429
I mean, they paid
for all my schooling,

634
00:47:04,731 --> 00:47:07,199
they put me in the Experimental
Design Bureau, and...

635
00:47:11,170 --> 00:47:12,204
Where are my manners?

636
00:47:13,607 --> 00:47:15,809
I've been talking like
this is all about me.

637
00:47:16,877 --> 00:47:18,277
It's actually all about you.

638
00:47:20,513 --> 00:47:21,513
Let's get started.

639
00:47:22,816 --> 00:47:26,753
Ella, would you be so kind
as to set us some mood music?

640
00:47:28,855 --> 00:47:31,248
You know what I love
most about Americans?

641
00:47:31,290 --> 00:47:34,051
American music, rock and roll.

642
00:47:34,093 --> 00:47:36,487
Would you like to listen
to a record with us?

643
00:47:36,529 --> 00:47:38,922
You know, they're not
called a records anymore?

644
00:47:38,964 --> 00:47:40,232
They're called tapes now.

645
00:47:58,451 --> 00:47:59,452
I like it.

646
00:48:03,723 --> 00:48:07,928
Now, tell us what I
know about the temple.

647
00:48:09,128 --> 00:48:10,128
Nein.

648
00:48:10,797 --> 00:48:12,431
Who told you it was here?

649
00:48:13,867 --> 00:48:14,867
Nein.

650
00:48:17,871 --> 00:48:19,806
I tried. You may begin.

651
00:48:25,812 --> 00:48:27,155
One of the things
I learned very early

652
00:48:27,179 --> 00:48:30,684
in the USSR is to be efficient.

653
00:48:32,686 --> 00:48:34,487
They pride themselves
on that shit.

654
00:48:37,389 --> 00:48:39,349
Hey, careful there, Doc.

655
00:48:39,391 --> 00:48:41,026
What is the American saying?

656
00:48:42,561 --> 00:48:44,631
"This little piggy
went to the market."

657
00:48:50,971 --> 00:48:53,472
Tell me what you know
about the temple.

658
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:56,977
I don't know anything.

659
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:11,992
You're gonna need some
gauze for that, stat.

660
00:49:23,202 --> 00:49:24,436
I won't ask again.

661
00:49:26,773 --> 00:49:30,534
Who told you it was
here?! Who else knows?!

662
00:49:30,576 --> 00:49:32,378
You know, I'm
gonna need a second.

663
00:49:33,914 --> 00:49:35,715
I'm a little
lightheaded after that.

664
00:49:37,817 --> 00:49:39,418
We have plenty of time.

665
00:49:41,053 --> 00:49:45,157
Delano specializes in
vivisection. That's Latin.

666
00:49:46,458 --> 00:49:48,051
Judging from some
of your tattoos,

667
00:49:48,093 --> 00:49:49,596
you have an interest in Latin.

668
00:49:50,997 --> 00:49:55,125
Vivi comes from the Latin
word vivus, which means alive.

669
00:49:55,167 --> 00:49:59,029
And section comes from the
Latin word section or cutting.

670
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:01,498
That's fantastic.

671
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:03,660
You know, it is really good
for a guy to have a hobby.

672
00:50:05,745 --> 00:50:08,314
"This little
piggy stayed home."

673
00:50:13,452 --> 00:50:17,824
You know, that hurts. I'll
admit it, that hurts a lot.

674
00:50:18,858 --> 00:50:21,560
Do we really need to discuss

675
00:50:22,696 --> 00:50:24,496
the little piggy that
had a roast beef?

676
00:50:25,832 --> 00:50:26,832
The CIA knows.

677
00:50:31,771 --> 00:50:34,866
And what was your exit strategy?

678
00:50:34,908 --> 00:50:37,343
Can't tell you, otherwise
I'd have to kill you.

679
00:50:39,111 --> 00:50:42,006
You know, you're not going
to make it out of this alive.

680
00:50:42,048 --> 00:50:43,282
You know that, don't you?

681
00:50:48,655 --> 00:50:50,422
Yeah, I get that.

682
00:50:51,891 --> 00:50:54,451
But I figure you won't kill
me because you need the code.

683
00:50:54,493 --> 00:50:55,820
What code?

684
00:50:55,862 --> 00:50:56,862
To turn it on.

685
00:50:58,064 --> 00:50:59,140
You can't just walk in
there after all these years

686
00:50:59,164 --> 00:51:00,725
and expect it to work.

687
00:51:00,767 --> 00:51:02,468
You need to know
how to turn it on.

688
00:51:03,603 --> 00:51:06,438
You give me what I
want, it's all yours.

689
00:51:07,473 --> 00:51:09,166
So what do you want?

690
00:51:09,208 --> 00:51:13,312
And please, choose your next
sentence very carefully.

691
00:51:16,082 --> 00:51:17,917
I wanna go back to 1982.

692
00:51:19,886 --> 00:51:22,554
You give me that,
it's all yours.

693
00:51:24,256 --> 00:51:25,850
And why wouldn't
be just torture you

694
00:51:25,892 --> 00:51:27,559
until you give us the code?

695
00:51:28,795 --> 00:51:30,305
You just chopped
off two of my fingers,

696
00:51:30,329 --> 00:51:32,590
and I'm still
willing to negotiate.

697
00:51:32,632 --> 00:51:34,926
And what if your
code doesn't work?

698
00:51:34,968 --> 00:51:37,361
Then you can let Delano play
doctor on us all he wants.

699
00:51:37,403 --> 00:51:39,731
Mm-mm! Mm-mm.

700
00:51:39,773 --> 00:51:40,840
Mm-mm, mm-mm.

701
00:51:47,413 --> 00:51:49,281
I think we could
cut another finger.

702
00:51:51,084 --> 00:51:52,744
You've never wanted
something as badly

703
00:51:52,786 --> 00:51:55,088
as I want this, not even close.

704
00:52:39,032 --> 00:52:41,034
You have yourself
a deal, Mr. Danger,

705
00:52:42,468 --> 00:52:45,730
but you make one wrong move,
and I won't just kill you,

706
00:52:45,772 --> 00:52:47,197
I'll also kill your girlfriend.

707
00:52:47,239 --> 00:52:50,076
Make no mistake about
that. I will not hesitate.

708
00:52:53,512 --> 00:52:54,512
Deal.

709
00:52:56,883 --> 00:52:58,317
And I won't just kill you,

710
00:52:59,485 --> 00:53:01,955
I'll Delano play
with you some more.

711
00:53:04,124 --> 00:53:06,726
I figured. I mean, I figured.

712
00:53:55,975 --> 00:53:57,376
Well, we're here.

713
00:55:11,851 --> 00:55:12,851
It's real.

714
00:55:15,355 --> 00:55:16,355
It's really here.

715
00:55:19,158 --> 00:55:20,435
Feel like we're
stepping onto the set

716
00:55:20,459 --> 00:55:21,661
of "Alien" right now.

717
00:55:24,463 --> 00:55:25,732
What is this place?

718
00:55:27,967 --> 00:55:32,105
It's a ship, an expedition
that went backwards in time,

719
00:55:33,172 --> 00:55:35,308
not from our time, the future.

720
00:55:36,575 --> 00:55:38,044
Very Marty McFly.

721
00:55:48,021 --> 00:55:50,181
How'd it get in the
mountain like this?

722
00:55:50,223 --> 00:55:53,684
The team didn't account for
the rotation of the Earth,

723
00:55:53,726 --> 00:55:54,961
or their math is off.

724
00:55:58,831 --> 00:56:01,801
Whatever it was, they wound
up inside of a mountain.

725
00:56:04,337 --> 00:56:06,039
How long you think
it's been here?

726
00:56:07,907 --> 00:56:09,508
Probably hundreds of years.

727
00:56:10,710 --> 00:56:13,137
The locals that used to
live here, the natives,

728
00:56:13,179 --> 00:56:15,740
they worshiped
this for centuries.

729
00:56:15,782 --> 00:56:17,951
Their myths, their legends,

730
00:56:19,118 --> 00:56:20,954
all arising out of
this holy mountain.

731
00:56:22,922 --> 00:56:25,058
Imagine what it must've
been like for them.

732
00:56:27,492 --> 00:56:30,797
One day, a flash appears,
cutting through the cliffs,

733
00:56:31,698 --> 00:56:34,067
avalanches and earthquakes,

734
00:56:35,234 --> 00:56:36,360
and then when you signed up

735
00:56:36,402 --> 00:56:38,004
your bravest soldiers
to investigate,

736
00:56:39,138 --> 00:56:41,332
they find something
so unimaginable

737
00:56:41,374 --> 00:56:43,500
that only a
supernatural explanation

738
00:56:43,542 --> 00:56:45,378
could possibly make
sense of it all.

739
00:56:48,281 --> 00:56:49,949
And then there
was the screaming.

740
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:54,720
The screaming?

741
00:56:56,956 --> 00:56:58,367
They say they used
to hear screaming

742
00:56:58,391 --> 00:56:59,625
from inside the mountain.

743
00:57:06,165 --> 00:57:07,508
And so what do
you think happened

744
00:57:07,532 --> 00:57:09,002
to all the natives, then?

745
00:57:11,871 --> 00:57:14,632
Radiation probably
wiped them all out.

746
00:57:14,674 --> 00:57:15,775
This thing is leaking.

747
00:57:17,210 --> 00:57:19,221
We've been here for months,
and in the past few days,

748
00:57:19,245 --> 00:57:21,280
several of our men
have gotten very sick.

749
00:57:22,448 --> 00:57:24,317
Rapid-onset cancer's
wiping everybody out.

750
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:29,455
So why are you here?

751
00:57:30,656 --> 00:57:32,959
We all know the Soviet
Union is going to fail.

752
00:57:34,394 --> 00:57:37,520
The economy can't keep up,
Regan is playing dirty.

753
00:57:37,562 --> 00:57:40,500
Our mission is to go back in
time and stop it from failing.

754
00:57:42,769 --> 00:57:46,831
That doesn't answer
why you are here, Ella.

755
00:57:46,873 --> 00:57:47,873
You're not Russian.

756
00:57:51,911 --> 00:57:54,905
You're too smart
for your own good.

757
00:57:54,947 --> 00:57:56,374
I'm here to go back in time

758
00:57:56,416 --> 00:57:59,243
and make sure the Soviets
lose World War II,

759
00:57:59,285 --> 00:58:03,247
that they never take Berlin,
never split my city in half,

760
00:58:03,289 --> 00:58:04,757
never drop the Iron Curtain.

761
00:58:05,792 --> 00:58:08,586
Wait. That's not the mission.

762
00:58:08,628 --> 00:58:09,729
Sounds good to me.

763
00:58:10,930 --> 00:58:12,265
Would you try to stop me?

764
00:58:14,734 --> 00:58:16,536
I just wanna get back to 1982.

765
00:58:19,338 --> 00:58:20,338
I'll stop you.

766
00:58:24,210 --> 00:58:25,577
Turn it on, now!

767
00:58:39,592 --> 00:58:41,719
Hey, do you guys really
think this is from 1999?

768
00:58:41,761 --> 00:58:43,521
Just do it! Enter the code.

769
00:58:43,563 --> 00:58:44,564
All right.

770
00:59:04,884 --> 00:59:06,577
Are you playing?

771
00:59:06,619 --> 00:59:07,619
No.

772
00:59:08,554 --> 00:59:10,714
Just a little
lightheaded is all.

773
00:59:55,434 --> 00:59:59,296
Sounds like we're
about to take off.

774
00:59:59,338 --> 01:00:00,998
- Lead the way.
- Ella.

775
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:02,775
You can't be serious.

776
01:03:09,796 --> 01:03:10,821
What is it?

777
01:03:10,863 --> 01:03:12,122
Shh.

778
01:03:12,164 --> 01:03:13,023
What is it?

779
01:03:13,065 --> 01:03:14,065
Be quiet!

780
01:03:16,135 --> 01:03:17,294
What is it?

781
01:03:17,336 --> 01:03:18,739
Shh.

782
01:03:22,174 --> 01:03:25,135
If you're stalling, I'm
going to kill the girl first.

783
01:03:26,112 --> 01:03:27,304
Bitch!

784
01:03:27,346 --> 01:03:28,740
Danger Jim is here
to save the day!

785
01:03:37,189 --> 01:03:38,215
Ah, shit.

786
01:03:38,257 --> 01:03:39,316
Woo!

787
01:03:39,358 --> 01:03:40,359
Who's left?!

788
01:03:44,296 --> 01:03:45,632
Woo! Danger Jim!

789
01:03:46,633 --> 01:03:47,991
Yes!

790
01:03:48,033 --> 01:03:49,077
You guys all right?
- Go, go!

791
01:03:49,101 --> 01:03:49,893
I'm going.

792
01:03:49,935 --> 01:03:51,962
Come on!

793
01:03:55,274 --> 01:03:59,103
This is what I get
for following a Nazi!

794
01:03:59,145 --> 01:04:00,145
God!

795
01:04:03,015 --> 01:04:05,151
I'll be okay. I'll be okay.

796
01:04:20,332 --> 01:04:22,926
What are you doing here?

797
01:04:22,968 --> 01:04:24,638
Saving your lives?

798
01:04:26,939 --> 01:04:29,366
Did you call yourself
Danger Jim back there?

799
01:04:29,408 --> 01:04:31,235
Oh, yeah. You like that?

800
01:04:31,277 --> 01:04:32,737
It's my new name.

801
01:04:32,779 --> 01:04:35,573
No, no, no, no, you can't
have it. Danger's my name.

802
01:04:35,615 --> 01:04:37,675
Oh, okay, like that
was a real name. Okay?

803
01:04:37,717 --> 01:04:39,194
Don't worry, you can
be Jungle Johnny.

804
01:04:39,218 --> 01:04:40,929
I don't wanna be Jungle Johnny.

805
01:04:40,953 --> 01:04:42,179
- I'm Danger now.
- No.

806
01:04:42,221 --> 01:04:43,180
- Yes.
- I'm Danger.

807
01:04:43,222 --> 01:04:44,415
- I'm Danger.
- I'm Danger.

808
01:04:44,457 --> 01:04:45,635
There's nothing
dangerous about you.

809
01:04:45,659 --> 01:04:47,159
We don't have time for this!

810
01:04:50,196 --> 01:04:51,196
I missed one.

811
01:05:25,364 --> 01:05:27,759
Shoot!
- Stop moving!

812
01:05:29,034 --> 01:05:30,862
Come on, hold still!

813
01:05:33,740 --> 01:05:34,740
Shoot!

814
01:05:40,312 --> 01:05:41,748
You missed two.

815
01:06:36,435 --> 01:06:37,629
That does not sound good.

816
01:06:42,909 --> 01:06:44,678
Are you hearing that?

817
01:06:53,653 --> 01:06:56,748
Daddy, I love you.

818
01:07:18,544 --> 01:07:19,544
Daddy!

819
01:07:25,018 --> 01:07:26,018
Jonathan.

820
01:07:28,588 --> 01:07:30,090
Ella.

821
01:07:31,725 --> 01:07:33,827
We really must
stop meeting like this.

822
01:07:36,495 --> 01:07:38,455
Is this our time capsule?

823
01:07:38,497 --> 01:07:39,497
It is.

824
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:43,135
And is this
our hide and shootout?

825
01:07:45,371 --> 01:07:46,706
Looks like it.

826
01:08:00,620 --> 01:08:03,389
I should've had Delano start
with the trigger fingers.

827
01:08:04,490 --> 01:08:05,490
I guess so.

828
01:08:10,797 --> 01:08:13,700
It's been a
pleasure, Mr. Danger.

829
01:08:31,851 --> 01:08:35,722
The adventure is just beginning.

830
01:08:48,034 --> 01:08:50,895
1982, right?

831
01:08:50,937 --> 01:08:54,431
1982.

832
01:09:18,865 --> 01:09:20,158
What are you doing?

833
01:09:20,200 --> 01:09:21,701
Coming with you.

834
01:09:22,602 --> 01:09:23,602
Jade.

835
01:09:29,142 --> 01:09:30,142
Mm.

836
01:09:32,178 --> 01:09:33,412
Sorry I'm late.

837
01:09:35,882 --> 01:09:36,882
Yeah.

838
01:09:39,953 --> 01:09:41,054
What are you doing?

839
01:09:43,056 --> 01:09:46,017
Mega Millions, here
we come. Holy shit!

840
01:09:46,059 --> 01:09:47,618
What happened to your fingers?

841
01:09:47,660 --> 01:09:50,088
Jim, where have you been?!

842
01:09:50,130 --> 01:09:51,622
- Where have I been?
- Yeah.

843
01:09:51,664 --> 01:09:53,609
Oh, I've just been killing
Russians, saving your life.

844
01:09:53,633 --> 01:09:55,727
I don't know, getting my
ass kicked by that guy.

845
01:09:55,769 --> 01:09:57,962
Did you see that?
