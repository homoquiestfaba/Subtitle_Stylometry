1
00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:44,486
There. There.

2
00:03:48,568 --> 00:03:49,705
There, my Lord.

3
00:03:53,118 --> 00:03:54,385
Dismount!

4
00:04:29,595 --> 00:04:30,689
Help me.

5
00:04:55,601 --> 00:04:57,349
Oh divine master...

6
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:01,570
most evil and supreme being.

7
00:05:03,109 --> 00:05:07,277
In the name of fear,
hate and destruction,

8
00:05:07,645 --> 00:05:10,304
I prepare this body filled
with royal blood

9
00:05:10,394 --> 00:05:13,883
as my sacrifice and offering.

10
00:05:29,021 --> 00:05:31,128
Through this symbol of your sovereignty,

11
00:05:31,218 --> 00:05:32,554
this scepter...

12
00:05:33,539 --> 00:05:36,063
the key to your resurrection and power.

13
00:05:36,756 --> 00:05:38,576
I will bring about the cataclysm.

14
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,507
The final and decisive clash

15
00:05:41,991 --> 00:05:45,190
between the Sons of Light
and the Sons of Darkness.

16
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,353
Bring torches.

17
00:05:53,396 --> 00:05:55,431
The prince is beyond this breech.

18
00:05:56,476 --> 00:06:00,125
In what evil company,
or what its nature, I cannot tell.

19
00:06:01,603 --> 00:06:04,071
This sign will strengthen and protect us.

20
00:06:18,941 --> 00:06:23,525
I prepare to anoint my spirit
with this royal blood.

21
00:06:23,784 --> 00:06:28,801
I prepare to anoint my spirit
with this royal blood.

22
00:06:34,039 --> 00:06:35,833
Prosatanos! Stop!

23
00:06:41,529 --> 00:06:42,681
Come on!

24
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:47,231
Fire!

25
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:54,570
Put your backs into it.

26
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:57,925
Quickly, take the Prince to a safe place.

27
00:07:59,373 --> 00:08:03,830
So, Lion Heart,
you think to deny my destiny.

28
00:08:04,248 --> 00:08:06,853
Your life's end is my destiny.

29
00:08:13,461 --> 00:08:15,604
Hurry, my Lord, we must confine him.

30
00:08:16,117 --> 00:08:18,470
-Please open the tomb.
-Help here.

31
00:08:18,843 --> 00:08:20,077
Move this slab.

32
00:08:20,963 --> 00:08:22,686
Faith will not hold him long.

33
00:08:25,281 --> 00:08:27,274
Damn you, spawn of Satan.

34
00:08:27,464 --> 00:08:31,266
-Look to Revelations priest.
-No!

35
00:08:32,057 --> 00:08:34,014
-No!
-I will betray you.

36
00:08:34,112 --> 00:08:35,775
Look in you Bible.

37
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:38,108
I will be unchained

38
00:08:38,198 --> 00:08:41,940
-and my freedom will span this globe.
-Seal it! Now!

39
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:45,825
This is only the beginning.

40
00:08:48,344 --> 00:08:50,019
You, help me.

41
00:08:54,977 --> 00:08:57,400
<i>Un nomenae padres, un file,
un spiritae sanctae.</i>

42
00:09:00,163 --> 00:09:01,795
<i>Un nomenae padres, un file,
un spiritae sanctae.</i>

43
00:09:01,885 --> 00:09:05,657
You say, this is the source of his power?

44
00:09:05,747 --> 00:09:09,058
Yes, my Lord, and the channel
for his vileness.

45
00:09:12,911 --> 00:09:15,160
<i>Un nomenae padres, un file,
un spiritae sanctae.</i>

46
00:09:15,575 --> 00:09:18,004
<i>Un nomenae padres, un file,
un spiritae sanctae.</i>

47
00:09:20,086 --> 00:09:22,026
No, no, my Lord!

48
00:09:22,168 --> 00:09:25,416
No, no. Sire, what are you doing?

49
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,060
Stop, please stop.

50
00:09:29,506 --> 00:09:30,764
No, my Lord.

51
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,433
Please stop!

52
00:09:44,479 --> 00:09:45,936
Console yourself, priest.

53
00:09:46,412 --> 00:09:48,147
If the words he spoke are true,

54
00:09:48,779 --> 00:09:50,856
then I have saved
not only the infant prince,

55
00:09:51,637 --> 00:09:54,348
but the unborn children of generations
to come.

56
00:09:54,771 --> 00:09:56,622
The words are true, sire.

57
00:09:56,987 --> 00:09:59,177
Everything he said is written.

58
00:09:59,267 --> 00:10:01,022
We must leave him in darkness then.

59
00:10:02,337 --> 00:10:05,377
And pray that he never again
sees the light of day.

60
00:10:11,703 --> 00:10:13,652
Seal all entrances to this place.

61
00:11:29,008 --> 00:11:30,651
Come here. Help me.

62
00:11:38,192 --> 00:11:39,526
What was that?

63
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:44,396
We are rich. We are rich.

64
00:11:47,253 --> 00:11:49,182
Look at the jewels on the crosses.

65
00:11:51,393 --> 00:11:53,658
Get the other one. Hurry.

66
00:12:13,609 --> 00:12:17,199
Let's see what's inside.

67
00:12:18,611 --> 00:12:20,748
Go. Go over there.

68
00:12:22,361 --> 00:12:23,578
Help me push.

69
00:13:15,071 --> 00:13:16,387
Who's your supplier?

70
00:13:18,074 --> 00:13:19,445
You can't do this! You're a cop!

71
00:13:20,068 --> 00:13:22,356
Yeah. Watch this you little piece of shit.

72
00:13:22,446 --> 00:13:24,418
Shatter! Don't shoot him, man.
Don't shoot him.

73
00:13:24,827 --> 00:13:26,386
-Please.
-Okay?

74
00:13:26,624 --> 00:13:27,890
-All right? Shatter.
-You little scumbag.

75
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:30,120
Let me talk to him, man.
Just let me talk to him.

76
00:13:31,248 --> 00:13:32,584
You've got a minute.

77
00:13:35,463 --> 00:13:37,535
Look, Jaybird,

78
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:40,022
why don't you just tell me
who your supplier is, okay?

79
00:13:40,112 --> 00:13:43,038
And I won't let my partner blow
your brains all over the street.

80
00:13:43,128 --> 00:13:44,216
All right?

81
00:13:44,306 --> 00:13:45,701
Okay, just talk to me, man.

82
00:13:45,809 --> 00:13:47,041
I can't, man.

83
00:13:48,117 --> 00:13:49,335
I'm a deadman if I do.

84
00:13:49,446 --> 00:13:52,318
Yeah, but you're a dead man if you don't.

85
00:13:53,146 --> 00:13:54,598
Come on. Why don't you just whisper it

86
00:13:54,688 --> 00:13:55,881
-in my ear. Come on.
-I can't, man.

87
00:13:55,971 --> 00:13:57,521
-Just... Just whisper it in my ear.
-I can't.

88
00:13:57,611 --> 00:14:00,311
-Come on. Come on.
-Man, time's up.

89
00:14:00,401 --> 00:14:02,114
-You're dead.
-No, no.

90
00:14:02,493 --> 00:14:04,476
-Spider, Spider.
-Oh, thank you. Thank you.

91
00:14:04,566 --> 00:14:05,891
Now, get lost.

92
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:09,987
And if ever see your butt
around here again, it is...

93
00:14:10,094 --> 00:14:11,734
Shatters.

94
00:14:13,374 --> 00:14:16,604
I love this good cop, bad cop stuff, man.

95
00:14:16,792 --> 00:14:19,711
But next time, I wanna be the bad cop.

96
00:14:21,942 --> 00:14:23,494
That feels better.

97
00:14:26,336 --> 00:14:28,235
How'd these things get up here?

98
00:14:37,622 --> 00:14:39,371
Hey, I know this lady.

99
00:14:39,901 --> 00:14:41,350
She's really great.

100
00:14:41,843 --> 00:14:43,151
She's a shrink.

101
00:14:43,564 --> 00:14:45,360
She could help you. I mean...

102
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:48,171
She's not in my line of work
or anything but...

103
00:14:49,319 --> 00:14:50,457
Hey.

104
00:14:51,526 --> 00:14:53,280
Hey, what are you doing in there?

105
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:56,897
Hey, are you listening to me?

106
00:14:57,677 --> 00:14:58,677
Tom.

107
00:14:59,601 --> 00:15:01,347
Don't you love me anymore?

108
00:15:02,644 --> 00:15:03,901
Tom?

109
00:15:04,352 --> 00:15:06,154
Come on, baby.

110
00:15:07,779 --> 00:15:09,370
What's the matter?

111
00:15:11,453 --> 00:15:12,991
Oh, whatever.

112
00:15:33,751 --> 00:15:36,151
Hey, man, that was the playoffs.

113
00:15:36,241 --> 00:15:38,179
You know, the playoffs?

114
00:15:41,314 --> 00:15:43,029
Ain't you no sports fan either?

115
00:15:43,782 --> 00:15:45,573
Is it all right if I take shower?

116
00:15:53,582 --> 00:15:56,594
So, what's going on
with my Bulls tickets for Game 2?

117
00:15:56,924 --> 00:15:58,173
I'm working on it.

118
00:15:58,945 --> 00:16:00,481
Who did he say was the supplier was?

119
00:16:00,571 --> 00:16:04,380
Would you believe
that it's that two bit pimp Spider?

120
00:16:05,354 --> 00:16:06,417
Figures.

121
00:16:08,344 --> 00:16:10,216
And speak of the devil.

122
00:16:10,431 --> 00:16:11,475
What's the matter, honey?

123
00:16:12,729 --> 00:16:13,994
Oh, man.

124
00:16:14,984 --> 00:16:16,151
I hate pimps.

125
00:16:16,624 --> 00:16:18,314
-I tell you...
-What are you trying to say, Jackson?

126
00:16:18,404 --> 00:16:19,852
You do what I tell you, you understand?

127
00:16:19,942 --> 00:16:21,219
He's mine, Shatter.

128
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,756
-He's all mine.
-Okay.

129
00:16:27,077 --> 00:16:28,168
You understand?

130
00:16:29,934 --> 00:16:31,727
You understand?

131
00:16:57,363 --> 00:16:58,897
You understand what I say to you?

132
00:17:01,327 --> 00:17:02,589
Do you understand? Do you understand?

133
00:17:02,679 --> 00:17:04,528
-It's not going to happen again?
-Hey, hey. Hey, hey, man.

134
00:17:04,618 --> 00:17:06,083
Hey, you don't want to do that, man.

135
00:17:06,173 --> 00:17:07,248
Get the hell out of here man!

136
00:17:07,338 --> 00:17:09,536
All right, hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey.

137
00:17:09,626 --> 00:17:11,483
Oh, you guys. You know what, man?

138
00:17:11,594 --> 00:17:13,948
#*@% you, man.
Get the hell out of here, man.

139
00:17:24,081 --> 00:17:25,128
You don't need that.

140
00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:29,902
I don't need it to kick your ass.

141
00:17:29,995 --> 00:17:31,454
Is that right, tough guy?

142
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:33,139
You're really that tough?

143
00:17:33,544 --> 00:17:34,629
Let's see.

144
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,334
Then, hit me.

145
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:42,052
Hey. Come on. Hit me, tough guy.

146
00:17:44,417 --> 00:17:46,169
-Hey, hey. Come on.
-Come on.

147
00:17:46,259 --> 00:17:47,811
Let's see how tough you really are.

148
00:17:54,358 --> 00:17:55,534
You call that a hit?

149
00:18:04,141 --> 00:18:05,257
That's a hit.

150
00:18:05,599 --> 00:18:07,512
Come on. Be a good little pimp
and give me that hand.

151
00:18:07,602 --> 00:18:09,683
Come on, put it up here. There you go.

152
00:18:09,773 --> 00:18:11,666
Right, right, right.

153
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:16,460
Sure feels good in here.

154
00:18:17,268 --> 00:18:18,789
Sure you don't want to join me?

155
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:21,668
For 50, we can do it again in the shower.

156
00:18:28,364 --> 00:18:29,416
Are you all right?

157
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:31,718
Yeah, I'm okay.

158
00:18:37,274 --> 00:18:38,480
Come in.

159
00:18:50,862 --> 00:18:52,031
This is Mr Shindler.

160
00:18:52,863 --> 00:18:53,999
Does he have it?

161
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:58,115
-Yes.
-Then, your part is finished, Mr Krieger.

162
00:18:59,895 --> 00:19:02,043
You money. Take it and leave.

163
00:19:18,781 --> 00:19:20,531
Bring it to me!

164
00:19:36,898 --> 00:19:38,558
How did you come buy this?

165
00:19:39,895 --> 00:19:41,888
It was entrusted to me.

166
00:19:49,135 --> 00:19:52,301
Thirty years, Prosatanos,
I sought you out.

167
00:19:52,739 --> 00:19:54,483
I know what you are!

168
00:19:54,951 --> 00:19:56,807
I know why you are here!

169
00:19:57,291 --> 00:20:00,164
And I've found what can kill you!

170
00:20:02,493 --> 00:20:05,078
Die. Servant of Satan!

171
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:06,948
Die!

172
00:20:22,933 --> 00:20:24,486
Where are you going?

173
00:20:24,968 --> 00:20:26,300
Rabbi?

174
00:20:28,484 --> 00:20:30,366
Hey, Jackson, how about that Bulls Game?

175
00:20:30,456 --> 00:20:32,792
Oh, shit! Bulls game.

176
00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:42,454
You're right about what I am
and why I'm here.

177
00:20:43,169 --> 00:20:44,546
But this...

178
00:20:45,726 --> 00:20:47,838
cannot destroy me.

179
00:21:12,997 --> 00:21:14,537
Time for you to leave.

180
00:21:16,278 --> 00:21:17,474
No!

181
00:21:25,787 --> 00:21:27,026
Oh, shit!

182
00:21:31,462 --> 00:21:33,382
She's alive! Call for an ambulance
and a back up!

183
00:21:33,795 --> 00:21:34,980
Unit 32 to headquarters.

184
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:36,468
We're at the Blue Ritz Hotel...

185
00:22:23,185 --> 00:22:24,197
Police.

186
00:22:25,141 --> 00:22:30,690
-Step out into the light.
-Leave now and I'll let you live.

187
00:22:30,787 --> 00:22:33,632
-You're all heart, buddy.
-Speaking of hearts...

188
00:23:10,777 --> 00:23:11,905
Shatter!

189
00:23:14,822 --> 00:23:16,768
Shatter! Shatter!

190
00:23:20,027 --> 00:23:21,745
I... Get off me.

191
00:23:23,161 --> 00:23:24,490
I said, get off of me.

192
00:23:33,342 --> 00:23:34,936
Oh, man.

193
00:23:35,735 --> 00:23:38,365
-Did you see him?
-See what?

194
00:23:38,663 --> 00:23:40,820
How could I see anything with you
on top of me?

195
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,895
What the hell happened in here?

196
00:23:44,985 --> 00:23:48,990
What if I told you shot a guy
in the chest, twice...

197
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:51,561
and he still kicked the shit out of me?

198
00:23:51,651 --> 00:23:56,604
Oh, Shatter come on, he was probably
wearing a bullet proof vest, all right?

199
00:23:56,829 --> 00:23:59,570
All right, wise-guy,
explain that down there.

200
00:24:00,884 --> 00:24:02,474
-What?
-Take a look.

201
00:24:06,659 --> 00:24:09,573
-Oh, shit! His heart's gone!
-No, it isn't.

202
00:24:09,663 --> 00:24:11,131
It's right there.

203
00:24:11,712 --> 00:24:13,388
Holy shit!

204
00:24:18,934 --> 00:24:21,366
Your attitude pisses me off.

205
00:24:21,655 --> 00:24:23,183
Get the heel out of here.

206
00:24:32,467 --> 00:24:35,869
Sergeant Shatter, I trust
you're not bored by all this?

207
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:38,774
No, I'm not bored.

208
00:24:39,018 --> 00:24:40,190
All right.

209
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:41,788
Let's get to it.

210
00:24:42,921 --> 00:24:44,293
What the hell happened?

211
00:24:45,304 --> 00:24:46,533
It's in the report.

212
00:24:48,257 --> 00:24:51,252
The man who was murdered last night
in Polanski Street was a Rabbi.

213
00:24:51,418 --> 00:24:53,479
His name Mordechai Shindler.

214
00:24:53,737 --> 00:24:56,130
And historian. Very highly regarded.

215
00:24:56,413 --> 00:24:59,026
What the hell's a Rabbi doing
in the neighbourhood like that?

216
00:24:59,204 --> 00:25:01,183
I expect you find that out.

217
00:25:01,484 --> 00:25:04,146
And in the interim,
the policy review people will want to know

218
00:25:04,236 --> 00:25:06,623
-where those two rounds went.
-Me too.

219
00:25:19,085 --> 00:25:20,243
Oh, man.

220
00:25:20,526 --> 00:25:23,229
Now, the Captain has taken
some chunks out of my ass before.

221
00:25:23,319 --> 00:25:26,220
But this time, she left nothing but bone.

222
00:25:27,926 --> 00:25:29,395
That the evidence package?

223
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:31,084
Oh, yeah.

224
00:25:31,174 --> 00:25:35,334
Oh, forensics called and they expedited
your rush job.

225
00:25:35,471 --> 00:25:36,639
Good.

226
00:25:37,709 --> 00:25:39,951
-They find any fingerprints on this thing?
-Yeah.

227
00:25:40,045 --> 00:25:44,405
The Rabbi's and somebody else's
they can't identify.

228
00:25:45,223 --> 00:25:46,498
I wonder what it is.

229
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:48,484
I don't know.

230
00:25:50,643 --> 00:25:52,073
So, what are we looking for?

231
00:25:53,395 --> 00:25:56,100
A reason why that Rabbi
was in a hotel room like that,

232
00:25:56,271 --> 00:25:57,537
and who killed him.

233
00:25:57,659 --> 00:25:59,295
Maybe there were all having
a ménage-a trios,

234
00:25:59,385 --> 00:26:01,198
and the Rabbi was getting more
than his share.

235
00:26:03,774 --> 00:26:04,897
What's that?

236
00:26:08,438 --> 00:26:10,746
I saw the Rabbi walk in the hotel
with someone...

237
00:26:11,534 --> 00:26:13,041
so did the desk clerk.

238
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:17,689
Bet it was this guy. "Reinhard Krieger

239
00:26:17,779 --> 00:26:19,531
Dealer in antiquities.

240
00:26:20,105 --> 00:26:22,455
Professor Malcolm Lockley. M.U."

241
00:26:22,745 --> 00:26:26,792
M.U. That's Mathers University,
right here in Chicago.

242
00:26:47,384 --> 00:26:48,608
Hello?

243
00:26:50,584 --> 00:26:51,667
Up here.

244
00:26:51,893 --> 00:26:53,072
May I help you?

245
00:26:54,058 --> 00:26:55,269
Man, I hope so.

246
00:26:56,254 --> 00:26:58,964
Chicago Police.
We're here to see Professor Lockley.

247
00:26:59,102 --> 00:27:01,651
Professor Lockley's heading
a research project in Jersusalem,

248
00:27:01,741 --> 00:27:02,771
at the University.

249
00:27:02,861 --> 00:27:05,290
-I'm his assistant.
-Has he been gone long?

250
00:27:05,735 --> 00:27:07,076
A few days.

251
00:27:07,433 --> 00:27:09,467
We have something
we want you take a look at.

252
00:27:09,557 --> 00:27:10,743
I'll be right down.

253
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:15,831
So from one to 10, what do you think?

254
00:27:16,655 --> 00:27:18,131
Don't say 12 now.

255
00:27:18,306 --> 00:27:19,528
Oh, you read my mind.

256
00:27:24,247 --> 00:27:25,875
I'd be happy to help you if you can.

257
00:27:25,982 --> 00:27:27,857
-I'm Leslie Hawkins.
-I'm Sergeant Shatter.

258
00:27:27,947 --> 00:27:29,692
This is my partner. Detective Jackson.

259
00:27:30,053 --> 00:27:31,657
Why don't you show her what we've got.

260
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,493
Where did you get this?

261
00:27:39,584 --> 00:27:42,363
It turned up as evidence
at a routine investigation.

262
00:27:55,448 --> 00:27:57,790
-Any ideas?
-Yes.

263
00:28:09,704 --> 00:28:10,778
Here.

264
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:12,870
You see?

265
00:28:14,606 --> 00:28:15,806
It's identical.

266
00:28:16,273 --> 00:28:17,460
What is this thing?

267
00:28:17,691 --> 00:28:20,650
This looks like the crown of the scepter
of Prosatanos.

268
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,141
Prosa who?

269
00:28:22,343 --> 00:28:26,280
Prosatanos is a mythological being
who was present in many of the legends

270
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:29,230
and stories of some
Middle Eastern civilizations,

271
00:28:29,445 --> 00:28:31,708
before and during the time
of the crusades.

272
00:28:32,226 --> 00:28:34,885
And you just happen to know all this?

273
00:28:35,652 --> 00:28:39,805
No, Professor Lockley has been studying
these myths for quite some time.

274
00:28:40,059 --> 00:28:42,252
He lectures world-wide on a mythology.

275
00:28:42,589 --> 00:28:45,212
If it's a myth, why do we have this?

276
00:28:46,354 --> 00:28:49,365
I know it's confusing but the study
of antiquities

277
00:28:49,455 --> 00:28:52,167
is different from archaeology
or paleonthology.

278
00:28:52,257 --> 00:28:55,060
Well, where's the rest of this scepter?

279
00:28:55,459 --> 00:28:58,897
According to the myth,
the scepter was broken into nine sections

280
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:02,049
by King Richard the Lion Heart
and by his order,

281
00:29:02,139 --> 00:29:05,312
hidden in nine Holy places, powerless.

282
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,563
So you mean, this is one
of the nine pieces?

283
00:29:07,992 --> 00:29:09,329
I can't be sure.

284
00:29:09,665 --> 00:29:12,659
Professor Lockley would be the one
to authenticate it when he returns.

285
00:29:12,749 --> 00:29:16,031
Okay, would you give us a call
as soon as he returns?

286
00:29:18,134 --> 00:29:19,659
And thank you very much for your time.

287
00:29:20,126 --> 00:29:21,336
My pleasure, sergeant.

288
00:29:26,846 --> 00:29:27,928
Thank you.

289
00:29:55,695 --> 00:29:56,768
Father.

290
00:29:58,386 --> 00:30:00,452
I... I'm really feeling quite ill.

291
00:30:00,794 --> 00:30:02,670
Do you wish me to take that for a while?

292
00:30:03,005 --> 00:30:04,445
Thank you, father.

293
00:30:06,432 --> 00:30:09,438
I must use the wash room.

294
00:30:09,649 --> 00:30:13,742
Certainly, we will soon be at the Vatican.

295
00:30:14,035 --> 00:30:15,894
It will be quite safe then.

296
00:30:16,047 --> 00:30:18,492
Do you believe it has begun to happen,

297
00:30:18,582 --> 00:30:22,109
as Father Bertrand warned?

298
00:30:22,199 --> 00:30:26,384
All we can do is hold tightly to our faith

299
00:30:26,474 --> 00:30:30,363
and the will of God will see us through.

300
00:30:30,453 --> 00:30:32,043
I'm going to the washroom.

301
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:33,816
Certainly. Certainly.

302
00:30:35,476 --> 00:30:40,071
But lock the door at the compartment
anyways.

303
00:30:40,525 --> 00:30:41,853
Certainly, Father.

304
00:31:24,601 --> 00:31:29,195
You must always cling tightly
to you faith, Father.

305
00:31:30,362 --> 00:31:31,528
<i>Oh, dieu Mia.</i>

306
00:31:31,618 --> 00:31:35,037
No matter how worthless it may be.

307
00:32:01,197 --> 00:32:03,189
Oh, Shatter, take a look at this.

308
00:32:03,579 --> 00:32:06,771
Perot says he'll run again for president
in 1996.

309
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:09,458
You know, I like this guy, man.

310
00:32:09,548 --> 00:32:10,842
I really do.

311
00:32:11,867 --> 00:32:14,751
Well, I've got some good news
and I've got some bad news.

312
00:32:15,066 --> 00:32:16,506
Which one do you want to hear first?

313
00:32:17,976 --> 00:32:19,218
How bad's the bad?

314
00:32:21,671 --> 00:32:22,830
This bad.

315
00:32:27,501 --> 00:32:29,819
Bulls, 8:00 p.m. tonight.

316
00:32:30,669 --> 00:32:34,437
Shatter! These are tickets for Game 2.

317
00:32:34,667 --> 00:32:36,904
Oh, buddy!

318
00:32:37,315 --> 00:32:38,545
Yeah!

319
00:32:39,947 --> 00:32:41,506
Oh, wait a minute.

320
00:32:41,902 --> 00:32:45,893
If this is the bad news,
then what the hell is the good news?

321
00:32:46,281 --> 00:32:48,267
The Israeli Police want to questions us.

322
00:32:49,484 --> 00:32:51,081
Oh, okay, sure.

323
00:32:51,463 --> 00:32:53,405
-So where are they?
-In Israel.

324
00:32:53,598 --> 00:32:55,122
We leave in four hours.

325
00:32:55,769 --> 00:32:57,183
Say what?

326
00:32:57,317 --> 00:32:59,758
We're also escorting the Rabbi back.

327
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:02,469
Wait, wait, wait. Shatter. It's... It's...

328
00:33:02,853 --> 00:33:05,256
You were in the room
when the shit hit the fan.

329
00:33:05,346 --> 00:33:08,611
I mean, I didn't see anything!
I mean, why in the hell do I have to go?

330
00:33:08,701 --> 00:33:12,713
Why can't I tell just you everything
that I know and then you can tell them.

331
00:33:13,164 --> 00:33:15,899
How could I possibly leave without you?
You're my partner, man.

332
00:33:17,118 --> 00:33:18,523
So that's it.

333
00:33:18,859 --> 00:33:19,918
What?

334
00:33:20,152 --> 00:33:21,896
You asked for me to go, didn't you?

335
00:33:22,086 --> 00:33:23,663
No, no, no. No, I didn't.

336
00:33:24,281 --> 00:33:25,547
Well, I ain't going.

337
00:33:26,299 --> 00:33:27,299
I ain't going.

338
00:33:27,389 --> 00:33:29,097
I don't care what anybody says.

339
00:33:29,454 --> 00:33:30,692
I ain't going.

340
00:33:31,337 --> 00:33:32,793
Fine. Fine.

341
00:33:49,118 --> 00:33:51,339
Oh, boy, man.

342
00:33:52,327 --> 00:33:54,029
If they were going to pack us
in like sardines,

343
00:33:54,119 --> 00:33:56,802
the least they could have put
some damn olive oil on the seats.

344
00:33:56,892 --> 00:33:57,936
Man.

345
00:34:03,437 --> 00:34:05,729
-Long flight, huh?
-It was a long one.

346
00:34:07,114 --> 00:34:08,454
Follow me, please.

347
00:34:09,938 --> 00:34:11,527
Hey, excuse me.

348
00:34:11,689 --> 00:34:13,381
What about the Rabbi's body?

349
00:34:13,956 --> 00:34:16,474
Yeah, we're escorting the remains
of an important Rabbi here.

350
00:34:16,781 --> 00:34:20,353
We see to that. Our driver will take you
to the hotel we have arranged for you.

351
00:34:22,163 --> 00:34:24,495
-What to care?
-I don't care. I just...

352
00:34:24,585 --> 00:34:26,655
I don't care. Whatever you want to do
with yourself.

353
00:34:26,857 --> 00:34:28,547
-Do you want to put this in the trunk?
-Here, here.

354
00:34:28,637 --> 00:34:30,194
-In the front?
-Oh, okay.

355
00:34:37,354 --> 00:34:39,357
You'll meet Captain Harrad this afternoon

356
00:34:39,499 --> 00:34:42,638
and I strongly suggest to you,
dress appropriately.

357
00:34:42,883 --> 00:34:44,152
Appropriately.

358
00:34:44,657 --> 00:34:45,715
Of course.

359
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:55,663
Hey, shalom.

360
00:34:56,303 --> 00:34:58,767
Hey, could you, like, turn up
the air conditioner?

361
00:34:58,926 --> 00:35:00,600
I'm like burning up back here.

362
00:35:02,217 --> 00:35:03,878
The AC. AC.

363
00:35:05,205 --> 00:35:06,289
Yeah.

364
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:09,914
Any more request?

365
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,551
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

366
00:35:19,694 --> 00:35:21,852
You think you could go a little faster,
maybe?

367
00:35:24,538 --> 00:35:26,810
Your sarcasm doesn't translate too well.

368
00:35:44,077 --> 00:35:45,397
You should have grabbed the Coke.

369
00:35:45,974 --> 00:35:47,752
Israeli drive-through, huh?

370
00:35:49,115 --> 00:35:51,949
-And I thought you were a shitty driver.
-Shitty?

371
00:35:52,674 --> 00:35:54,946
-What is this word, shitty?
-Oh, shitty.

372
00:35:55,232 --> 00:35:59,551
Oh, it's a... It's a Latin expression
for a hot shot.

373
00:35:59,915 --> 00:36:01,083
Hot shot?

374
00:36:01,358 --> 00:36:04,114
Hot shot. You know, a top gun?

375
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:07,237
“Top Gun” Top Gun, yeah,
I've seen this movie.

376
00:36:07,327 --> 00:36:08,587
It's very good. I like it.

377
00:36:08,756 --> 00:36:11,958
-Yeah.
-I'm a very shitty driver, yeah?

378
00:36:12,426 --> 00:36:13,658
Short cut.

379
00:36:17,221 --> 00:36:18,838
Hey, what the hell are you doing?

380
00:36:29,825 --> 00:36:31,208
Stop this, man!

381
00:36:36,242 --> 00:36:37,388
Yo!

382
00:36:42,016 --> 00:36:44,976
Yeah, you're right.
You're a shitty driver, all right.

383
00:37:00,317 --> 00:37:02,085
Okay, this is you hotel.

384
00:37:02,497 --> 00:37:04,530
This is our hotel?

385
00:37:07,845 --> 00:37:09,340
What is this?

386
00:37:09,705 --> 00:37:11,282
Hey, this ain't our hotel!

387
00:37:11,585 --> 00:37:15,239
Hey, hey, Shatter. I ain't staying
at no dump like this, Shatter.

388
00:37:15,433 --> 00:37:18,539
You know, I got some pride.
You know, I've got a reputation.

389
00:37:18,639 --> 00:37:20,884
-Okay?
-I'll pick you up in an hour.

390
00:37:20,974 --> 00:37:22,740
Yeah, but I've got our expense money.

391
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:25,684
Oh, okay, okay. You've got
the money. All right.

392
00:37:25,887 --> 00:37:27,055
All right.

393
00:37:40,109 --> 00:37:44,083
Man, we're in the middle
of a damn swap meet.

394
00:37:44,256 --> 00:37:45,691
They've called flea markets here.

395
00:37:45,781 --> 00:37:47,049
Yeah, well, I don't care
what they call it.

396
00:37:47,139 --> 00:37:48,911
I don't want to be in the middle of one.

397
00:37:49,519 --> 00:37:50,722
Jet lag.

398
00:37:52,015 --> 00:37:54,384
Shatter, look. I can't sleep on that bed.

399
00:37:55,792 --> 00:37:59,594
-What's wrong with that bed?
-Because I've got to be near the AC vent.

400
00:38:00,409 --> 00:38:01,660
Do you want to tell me why?

401
00:38:02,152 --> 00:38:04,048
Hey, I'm just looking out for you,
all right?

402
00:38:04,211 --> 00:38:06,092
You know, if I get too hot
while I'm sleeping.

403
00:38:06,182 --> 00:38:08,284
I snore like a garbage disposal. Okay?

404
00:38:08,374 --> 00:38:09,509
Okay, okay.

405
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:10,643
Whatever works.

406
00:38:15,472 --> 00:38:16,648
Look, can you get ready now.

407
00:38:45,678 --> 00:38:47,012
I am Captain Harrad.

408
00:38:47,145 --> 00:38:49,070
I have some questions to ask you.

409
00:38:55,234 --> 00:38:58,639
Is that the way Chicago police dress
for business?

410
00:38:58,740 --> 00:38:59,990
On our better days.

411
00:39:00,517 --> 00:39:04,005
I should hate to see you
on one of your bad days.

412
00:39:05,502 --> 00:39:09,127
My questions have to do
with the background investigations,

413
00:39:09,234 --> 00:39:12,559
regarding Rabbi Shindler's activities
and associations

414
00:39:12,649 --> 00:39:15,077
during his brief stay
in the United States.

415
00:39:15,510 --> 00:39:17,537
Excuse me, Captain Harrad.

416
00:39:17,627 --> 00:39:19,292
Is this going to take a long time?

417
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:23,532
Due to the circumstances of the crime

418
00:39:24,318 --> 00:39:26,907
and the condition
of Rabbi Schindler's body,

419
00:39:27,605 --> 00:39:31,807
my intentions is to be precise,
Detective Jackson.

420
00:39:32,004 --> 00:39:35,301
And I take it you are not unfamiliar
with that word.

421
00:39:37,799 --> 00:39:43,592
Let's begin from the time of his entry
into your country nine weeks ago.

422
00:39:52,817 --> 00:39:55,480
That completes the inquiry, gentlemen.

423
00:39:56,511 --> 00:39:58,694
I have no more questions at this time.

424
00:39:59,174 --> 00:40:00,945
-You may leave now.
-Thank, God.

425
00:40:01,164 --> 00:40:03,661
I get the impression
that Rabbi Shindler's murder...

426
00:40:05,017 --> 00:40:06,640
is not an isolated case.

427
00:40:08,903 --> 00:40:11,321
Keep your impressions to yourself,
Sergeant.

428
00:40:11,673 --> 00:40:13,265
Oh, excuse me, Captain.

429
00:40:13,688 --> 00:40:15,172
You know, we're all cops here.

430
00:40:16,601 --> 00:40:17,954
I'm the only cop.

431
00:40:18,111 --> 00:40:19,771
You two are tourists.

432
00:40:20,744 --> 00:40:23,753
And that will be your only status
while you are in Israel.

433
00:40:23,938 --> 00:40:25,411
See that you remember that.

434
00:40:25,801 --> 00:40:31,950
Attempt to practice your trade here,
and I promise you...

435
00:40:33,169 --> 00:40:38,006
I will bury you in the deepest, darkest,
filthiest hole I can find.

436
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:39,624
We get your point, Captain.

437
00:40:41,391 --> 00:40:42,613
You may go now.

438
00:40:59,484 --> 00:41:00,695
Number 20.

439
00:41:02,908 --> 00:41:04,355
-Any messages?
-No.

440
00:41:10,092 --> 00:41:12,363
I think we'll give this guy Krieger
a call tomorrow.

441
00:41:12,941 --> 00:41:13,941
What?

442
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:16,879
Wait, wait, wait.
Didn't you hear what Harrad said?

443
00:41:16,969 --> 00:41:19,303
He told us to keep our noses out of it.

444
00:41:19,393 --> 00:41:22,411
-Out of it, Shatter.
-I heard what Harrad said.

445
00:41:22,662 --> 00:41:24,335
We'll rent a car tomorrow morning.

446
00:41:34,318 --> 00:41:36,742
So, what are we coming to this guy
for, huh?

447
00:41:36,832 --> 00:41:38,557
Oh, it's the only lead we've got.

448
00:41:39,772 --> 00:41:41,191
This must be the place.

449
00:41:48,697 --> 00:41:49,821
Shalom.

450
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:53,569
-May I help you?
-Reinhard Krieger?

451
00:41:53,801 --> 00:41:55,082
Do I know you, gentlemen?

452
00:41:55,172 --> 00:41:58,029
-I know you Reinhard.
-You were referred to me.

453
00:41:59,566 --> 00:42:01,273
Do you know where I found this?

454
00:42:01,847 --> 00:42:04,286
At the Blue Ritz Hotel in Chicago.

455
00:42:05,725 --> 00:42:06,936
Cabinets.

456
00:42:07,169 --> 00:42:08,196
Who are you?

457
00:42:08,566 --> 00:42:11,018
I'm Sergeant Shatter
and this is Detective Jackson.

458
00:42:11,668 --> 00:42:13,162
Chicago police.

459
00:42:13,668 --> 00:42:15,851
Very good, Reinhard. Very good.

460
00:42:17,642 --> 00:42:20,074
-What's up here?
-That is my home!

461
00:42:20,184 --> 00:42:21,881
You can't go up there!

462
00:42:24,071 --> 00:42:25,734
Who's Malcolm Lockley, Kreiger?

463
00:42:26,292 --> 00:42:27,808
Why is his name on you business card.

464
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:29,841
He's a professor at Jerusalem University.

465
00:42:29,931 --> 00:42:31,546
Anyway, you have no authority here.

466
00:42:31,636 --> 00:42:34,758
Well, what were you doing in a hotel
like that with Rabbi Shindler?

467
00:42:35,095 --> 00:42:37,720
That was private business
and you have no right here.

468
00:42:37,810 --> 00:42:39,016
-Now, get out of my house.
-Oh, yeah.

469
00:42:39,106 --> 00:42:41,657
Well, what was that private business?

470
00:42:41,781 --> 00:42:43,778
Was that private business this?

471
00:42:44,145 --> 00:42:46,066
Who was in the room with you
and Rabbi Shindler?

472
00:42:46,156 --> 00:42:48,805
Who was it that ripped the heart right out
of his chest?

473
00:42:48,939 --> 00:42:51,019
-What?
-You were in that room, Krieger.

474
00:42:51,233 --> 00:42:53,500
-You know who killed that rabbi.
-I don't know.

475
00:42:53,590 --> 00:42:55,386
That makes you an accessory murder,
Krieger.

476
00:42:55,476 --> 00:42:58,249
-I don't know what you're talking bout.
-You're going down, Krieger.

477
00:42:58,339 --> 00:43:00,674
-You're going down!
-Get out!

478
00:43:01,050 --> 00:43:02,647
-Get out!
-You're going to jail, Krieger!

479
00:43:02,737 --> 00:43:03,888
Get out of my house!

480
00:43:04,299 --> 00:43:05,905
It's all over, Krieger.

481
00:43:06,893 --> 00:43:08,208
Think we upset him?

482
00:43:08,535 --> 00:43:09,596
Could be.

483
00:43:09,686 --> 00:43:11,503
You know, I thought
you were going to play good cop.

484
00:43:11,593 --> 00:43:13,067
I thought you were going
to play good cop.

485
00:43:13,157 --> 00:43:17,003
Oh, man, you know,
we've got to figure this out, Shatter.

486
00:43:17,507 --> 00:43:20,268
-Can't you read a map? Which way?
-Just turn down here.

487
00:43:37,195 --> 00:43:38,471
I'm pulling over.

488
00:43:42,976 --> 00:43:45,386
-Do you have any idea where we are?
-Yeah.

489
00:43:45,751 --> 00:43:47,052
I mean, kind of.

490
00:43:47,503 --> 00:43:48,741
Oh, hell, no.

491
00:43:49,036 --> 00:43:51,269
Do you have any idea
where the university is?

492
00:43:51,493 --> 00:43:54,143
I don't know and I don't give a shit.

493
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:55,465
Then, why did you tell me
to turn back there?

494
00:43:55,555 --> 00:43:58,471
Because I'm tired
of you always going straight.

495
00:43:58,561 --> 00:43:59,921
What are you all pissed off about?

496
00:44:00,278 --> 00:44:01,499
I don't like it here.

497
00:44:01,589 --> 00:44:04,278
I'm hot, I'm sweaty
and I'm so damn hungry, man.

498
00:44:04,368 --> 00:44:06,666
I could eat the south end
of a northbound skunk.

499
00:44:06,770 --> 00:44:08,088
You ate on the plane.

500
00:44:08,178 --> 00:44:11,481
Shatter, do you realize
how long ago that was?

501
00:44:11,628 --> 00:44:13,784
You know, I, I wa...
I want my share of the per Diem, man.

502
00:44:13,874 --> 00:44:16,422
-And I want it right now.
-Okay, okay.

503
00:44:18,783 --> 00:44:20,794
Here. Now, do you feel better.

504
00:44:21,021 --> 00:44:22,887
-[Where are you going to eat around here?
-]Hey, hey, hey.

505
00:44:22,977 --> 00:44:24,853
Where doesn't matter, you know?

506
00:44:24,943 --> 00:44:26,353
It's the principle, you know?

507
00:44:26,443 --> 00:44:29,247
Now, I can eat when I want to.

508
00:44:29,613 --> 00:44:31,425
Fine. Fine.

509
00:44:32,112 --> 00:44:35,818
You see, Shatter, man, you know,
you're problem is you're a control freak.

510
00:44:35,908 --> 00:44:38,963
It's either your way or no way.

511
00:44:39,096 --> 00:44:40,987
Hey, but that ain't my way.

512
00:44:42,470 --> 00:44:44,747
-What the hell is this?
-Hey, get out of here.

513
00:44:44,837 --> 00:44:47,886
-Out of the car, kid.
-No, please, hide me. He'll kill me.

514
00:44:47,976 --> 00:44:49,320
-Who's trying to kill you?
-Mustaph.

515
00:44:49,410 --> 00:44:51,616
He, he wants money.
He beats me if I won't pay.

516
00:44:51,706 --> 00:44:53,024
What? Where?

517
00:44:53,114 --> 00:44:55,452
It's him. Please hide me, I beg you.

518
00:44:55,701 --> 00:44:58,302
That kid? I'll take care of this.

519
00:44:58,392 --> 00:44:59,557
Come on, hey.

520
00:44:59,808 --> 00:45:00,964
Come on.

521
00:45:01,263 --> 00:45:02,233
Don't worry, come on. Don't worry.

522
00:45:02,323 --> 00:45:03,383
-I'm going to get you.
-Don't worry. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

523
00:45:03,473 --> 00:45:05,356
Knock it off. Knock it off.

524
00:45:05,489 --> 00:45:06,943
What's the matter with you, guys?

525
00:45:07,033 --> 00:45:09,422
Can't you get along?
Did I say knock it off?

526
00:45:09,512 --> 00:45:10,976
Knock it off.

527
00:45:11,534 --> 00:45:13,707
-I'm going to beat the hell of him.
-Hey, hey, hey.

528
00:45:13,797 --> 00:45:16,360
Knock it off. Hey, I want you
to play fair with each other.

529
00:45:16,450 --> 00:45:17,801
All right.

530
00:45:17,956 --> 00:45:19,842
All right, now, I want you guys
to be friends here.

531
00:45:19,932 --> 00:45:21,688
Come on now and shake hands. Come on.

532
00:45:22,048 --> 00:45:23,232
There you go.

533
00:45:23,586 --> 00:45:24,841
Good, good.

534
00:45:24,978 --> 00:45:27,289
You see, now, that's the American away.
Right there.

535
00:45:27,379 --> 00:45:28,647
All right, buddies.

536
00:45:29,165 --> 00:45:30,963
Yeah, the American way.

537
00:45:31,265 --> 00:45:33,196
Yeah, okay, good, good.

538
00:45:33,559 --> 00:45:34,655
-Good.
-Thanks for everything.

539
00:45:34,745 --> 00:45:36,665
Hey, that's all right, buddy. Anytime.

540
00:45:39,298 --> 00:45:40,600
You see that?

541
00:45:41,971 --> 00:45:43,998
I know how to deal with kids.

542
00:45:44,186 --> 00:45:47,051
It don't matter which part of the world
you're in,

543
00:45:47,254 --> 00:45:49,783
you just treat them as equals.

544
00:45:49,873 --> 00:45:52,141
-Yeah. Equals, huh?
-Yeah.

545
00:45:52,593 --> 00:45:55,681
It sounds good, Cal, but, don't you think
we should chase those two kids down

546
00:45:55,771 --> 00:45:57,967
-and get your wallet back.
-What?

547
00:45:59,648 --> 00:46:02,344
Why that lousy little lying punk
snaked my wallet.

548
00:46:02,434 --> 00:46:04,962
-He sure did.
-Oh, man.

549
00:46:05,572 --> 00:46:06,892
You go down that way, I'll take this way.

550
00:46:06,982 --> 00:46:08,788
All right
but if you catch that little turd,

551
00:46:08,878 --> 00:46:12,143
you hold for me because I'm going
to break every bone in his body.

552
00:46:12,233 --> 00:46:14,651
-Equals remember?
-Equals my ass.

553
00:47:06,934 --> 00:47:08,574
How long do you think you can hang there?

554
00:47:08,673 --> 00:47:09,800
What?

555
00:47:10,210 --> 00:47:12,170
Tell me where the wallet is.
And I'll pick you up.

556
00:47:12,659 --> 00:47:14,602
You have me at a disadvantage, sir.

557
00:47:15,636 --> 00:47:16,842
Well?

558
00:47:18,653 --> 00:47:19,926
My back pocket.

559
00:47:36,171 --> 00:47:37,304
What's your name, kid?

560
00:47:37,870 --> 00:47:39,581
-Bezi.
-Bezi.

561
00:47:40,216 --> 00:47:41,469
This scam work on everyone?

562
00:47:41,648 --> 00:47:42,906
Only Americans.

563
00:47:43,379 --> 00:47:44,469
That figures.

564
00:47:44,743 --> 00:47:46,622
You know my buddy's really upset with you.

565
00:47:46,990 --> 00:47:48,750
I don't think you want to run
into him again.

566
00:47:49,957 --> 00:47:51,709
Oh, I would hope not, sir.

567
00:47:52,336 --> 00:47:53,528
I'll tell you what,

568
00:47:54,433 --> 00:47:57,669
you tell me where Jerusalem University is
and I'll let you go.

569
00:47:59,416 --> 00:48:00,416
Deal?

570
00:48:01,481 --> 00:48:02,481
Deal.

571
00:48:03,088 --> 00:48:04,088
Okay.

572
00:48:06,519 --> 00:48:07,680
So how do I get there?

573
00:48:14,077 --> 00:48:15,781
Oh, you find the little shit?

574
00:48:17,768 --> 00:48:19,227
You found my wallet.

575
00:48:21,030 --> 00:48:23,904
-Oh, man, the money's gone.
-Oh, really.

576
00:48:24,403 --> 00:48:25,567
Tough break, partner.

577
00:49:00,295 --> 00:49:04,394
You know, I like to eat every day or so.
Anything wrong with that?

578
00:49:05,105 --> 00:49:06,482
No. There's nothing wrong with that.

579
00:49:06,572 --> 00:49:07,859
Oh, all right.

580
00:49:08,095 --> 00:49:09,377
Too bad about your money though.

581
00:49:09,709 --> 00:49:11,573
Oh, too bad about my money, huh?

582
00:49:11,732 --> 00:49:13,134
So, what are you trying to tell me?

583
00:49:13,224 --> 00:49:14,797
That you're not going to share with me?

584
00:49:14,887 --> 00:49:17,415
-Is that what you're trying to say?
-No. I wouldn't do that.

585
00:49:26,764 --> 00:49:27,983
There's his office.

586
00:49:37,704 --> 00:49:41,296
-You think this guy really exists?
-Yeah, he exists.

587
00:49:48,356 --> 00:49:49,356
Frank.

588
00:49:50,935 --> 00:49:53,163
Isn't that the girl
from Mathers University?

589
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:54,822
Yeah, it is.

590
00:49:57,500 --> 00:49:58,717
Do you want it right away?

591
00:49:59,110 --> 00:50:00,251
In 10 minutes?

592
00:50:00,698 --> 00:50:03,130
-I could get it together for you.
-Terrific.

593
00:50:05,383 --> 00:50:07,690
-Hello again.
-This is quite a surprise.

594
00:50:07,780 --> 00:50:09,293
That goes both ways, Miss Hawkins.

595
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:12,174
I hadn't expected to see you again
so soon, Sergeant Shatter.

596
00:50:12,917 --> 00:50:13,970
Frank.

597
00:50:14,743 --> 00:50:15,808
Leslie.

598
00:50:16,653 --> 00:50:18,850
Excuse me. I'm here too.

599
00:50:19,181 --> 00:50:20,865
Yes you are, Detective...?

600
00:50:21,551 --> 00:50:24,605
-Jackson, Jackson.
-Right.

601
00:50:25,195 --> 00:50:27,653
Clarit, I'd like you to meet
two Chicago cops.

602
00:50:27,854 --> 00:50:29,350
-Pleasure.
-How do you do?

603
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:30,479
Hello.

604
00:50:30,569 --> 00:50:32,483
Clarit is Professor Lockley's secretary.

605
00:50:32,636 --> 00:50:34,485
That's why we're here.
We'd like to talk to him.

606
00:50:34,575 --> 00:50:36,188
He's at the excavation site.

607
00:50:36,628 --> 00:50:37,847
How do we get there?

608
00:50:38,473 --> 00:50:39,609
I can take you.

609
00:50:39,890 --> 00:50:40,890
Great.

610
00:50:50,696 --> 00:50:53,035
What's to find in the middle of nowhere?

611
00:50:53,374 --> 00:50:56,318
It wasn't always the middle of nowhere,
Mr. Jackson.

612
00:50:56,704 --> 00:51:00,086
Bechung existed more than a thousand years
before Christ.

613
00:51:00,684 --> 00:51:03,573
During the Roman empire,
it was one of the largest cities.

614
00:51:04,137 --> 00:51:06,364
Then, the first crusaders built forts
and churches

615
00:51:06,454 --> 00:51:09,253
that were already crumbling
by the time Richard the Lion Heart

616
00:51:09,343 --> 00:51:12,001
led the third expedition
into the Holy Land.

617
00:51:37,244 --> 00:51:40,281
You may find Professor Lockley
rather eccentric.

618
00:51:40,606 --> 00:51:41,707
How so?

619
00:51:42,062 --> 00:51:44,043
He spends most of this time
absorbed in a period

620
00:51:44,133 --> 00:51:46,123
that existed 2,000 years ago.

621
00:51:59,762 --> 00:52:02,051
The professor's very touchy about his work

622
00:52:02,446 --> 00:52:06,098
but his interest in this Church
he is excavating is extraordinary.

623
00:52:10,467 --> 00:52:14,640
Some areas of this dig are off limits
to everyone, including me.

624
00:52:21,134 --> 00:52:23,315
-Why's that?
-I've learned not to ask.

625
00:52:23,765 --> 00:52:24,994
Oh, look at this!

626
00:52:36,148 --> 00:52:39,834
Oh, princess, what a pleasant surprise.

627
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:49,079
And we have guests.

628
00:52:59,726 --> 00:53:02,153
I apologize for disturbing you,
Professor Lockley,

629
00:53:02,243 --> 00:53:05,174
but these are the Chicago police officers
I told you about.

630
00:53:05,392 --> 00:53:08,127
This is Sergeant Shatter
and Detective Jackson.

631
00:53:08,598 --> 00:53:10,500
Oh, yes, the gentlemen with the artifact.

632
00:53:10,833 --> 00:53:12,538
Aren't you a triffle off your beaten path?

633
00:53:12,857 --> 00:53:13,857
A little.

634
00:53:14,744 --> 00:53:16,344
I'd like for you to take a look at this.

635
00:53:18,805 --> 00:53:20,544
Does the name Shindler
mean anything to you?

636
00:53:20,789 --> 00:53:22,519
-Should it?
-You tell me.

637
00:53:23,855 --> 00:53:26,843
-No.
-What about Krieger, a Reinhard Krieger?

638
00:53:26,933 --> 00:53:28,208
Are you interrogating me?

639
00:53:28,298 --> 00:53:30,671
Your name was found on Krieger's card
at a murder scene.

640
00:53:30,785 --> 00:53:31,854
Really.

641
00:53:32,963 --> 00:53:34,017
Yes, Krieger telephoned me.

642
00:53:34,107 --> 00:53:35,848
People seek my services
from all over the world

643
00:53:35,938 --> 00:53:37,910
to authenticate some trinket or other.

644
00:53:38,401 --> 00:53:39,638
Then, you never met Krieger, huh?

645
00:53:39,728 --> 00:53:42,148
I haven't the time to lend credence
to babbling morons

646
00:53:42,238 --> 00:53:44,959
who blindly accept mythology and legend
as fact.

647
00:53:46,805 --> 00:53:49,459
You know, we saw a drawing of this thing
in your office.

648
00:53:50,598 --> 00:53:53,803
I assume you've also seen drawings
of Santa Claus and the Tooth Fairy.

649
00:53:54,361 --> 00:53:55,668
Then, what about this?

650
00:53:56,628 --> 00:53:58,116
That sadly is a fake.

651
00:53:58,441 --> 00:54:00,121
A comparatively modern forgery,

652
00:54:00,211 --> 00:54:02,862
of the crown of the scepter
of the mythological Prosatanos.

653
00:54:02,952 --> 00:54:04,605
Now, why would anyone forge
a piece of something

654
00:54:04,695 --> 00:54:05,961
that never existed?

655
00:54:06,289 --> 00:54:07,738
Human nature, Sergeant.

656
00:54:08,174 --> 00:54:10,123
Where no deity exists, create one!

657
00:54:10,213 --> 00:54:12,844
It's the basis of all religions,
misguided faith.

658
00:54:13,571 --> 00:54:15,291
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have work to do.

659
00:54:16,864 --> 00:54:18,287
Princess.

660
00:54:22,889 --> 00:54:25,100
You know, he's not eccentric.

661
00:54:27,294 --> 00:54:28,652
He's just an asshole.

662
00:54:30,263 --> 00:54:31,698
I said he was touchy.

663
00:54:56,558 --> 00:54:58,034
-Any messages?
-Yes.

664
00:55:01,130 --> 00:55:02,228
Who's it from?

665
00:55:02,663 --> 00:55:04,949
Captain Hull, she wants a report.

666
00:55:06,466 --> 00:55:09,384
You know, I think she misses
the tender tones of your voice.

667
00:55:10,223 --> 00:55:11,990
Well, she's going to be disappointed then.

668
00:55:12,149 --> 00:55:15,350
Because you're going to call her
and make the report.

669
00:55:16,135 --> 00:55:18,189
-Why me?
-Because I'm a Sergeant.

670
00:55:18,279 --> 00:55:19,507
And you're not.

671
00:55:19,837 --> 00:55:21,377
Okay, Frank, old buddy.

672
00:55:22,105 --> 00:55:25,045
I'd be tickled to give Captain Hull
a call.

673
00:55:25,359 --> 00:55:26,689
After all...

674
00:55:27,271 --> 00:55:29,708
this is what friends are for.

675
00:55:47,032 --> 00:55:49,562
Because he's busy bonehead,
just put her on.

676
00:55:51,821 --> 00:55:54,879
Excuse me, Captain,
Jackson's on Line 3 from Israel.

677
00:55:54,994 --> 00:55:56,181
Jackson!

678
00:55:57,854 --> 00:56:00,405
-Hey, Captain.
-Jackson, what the hell's going on?

679
00:56:00,495 --> 00:56:03,340
I specifically asked for Shatter to call.

680
00:56:03,683 --> 00:56:05,484
Well, Captain. I mean, hey, look.

681
00:56:05,574 --> 00:56:07,577
He tried his best to call you himself

682
00:56:07,667 --> 00:56:10,305
but the poor guy, I mean he's as sick
as a dog.

683
00:56:27,703 --> 00:56:29,114
You boys wanna try it again?

684
00:56:32,853 --> 00:56:35,349
Yeah, look, it's not really for me
to mention.

685
00:56:35,689 --> 00:56:38,746
<i>I mean, he'd be the last one
to say anything about it</i>

686
00:56:38,836 --> 00:56:41,343
but he misses you a lot, Captain.

687
00:56:43,988 --> 00:56:47,372
Of course, well, he can call tomorrow,

688
00:56:47,462 --> 00:56:48,869
<i>when he's had a good nights rest.</i>

689
00:56:49,052 --> 00:56:50,726
You... You sure he's all right?

690
00:56:51,155 --> 00:56:52,763
I think he's just fine.

691
00:57:04,397 --> 00:57:05,397
Yeah.

692
00:57:05,919 --> 00:57:06,919
You too.

693
00:57:07,745 --> 00:57:09,093
Thanks.

694
00:57:53,290 --> 00:57:54,373
What happened to you?

695
00:57:54,869 --> 00:57:57,111
Oh, that little shit Krieger.

696
00:57:58,138 --> 00:58:00,170
Oh, he took the scepter piece too.

697
00:58:00,474 --> 00:58:01,915
So that's why they're here.

698
00:58:03,659 --> 00:58:04,939
Let's go get it back.

699
00:58:06,473 --> 00:58:07,903
What the hell.

700
00:58:12,003 --> 00:58:13,873
Ain't no use in locking the door.

701
00:58:51,568 --> 00:58:54,878
You disappoint me greatly, Mr Krieger.

702
00:58:55,396 --> 00:58:57,031
I've only done what you asked.

703
00:58:57,660 --> 00:58:58,975
What you paid me for.

704
00:58:59,136 --> 00:59:00,478
You are messy.

705
00:59:01,718 --> 00:59:03,632
You draw attention to yourself.

706
00:59:03,870 --> 00:59:05,683
Also, me.

707
00:59:05,893 --> 00:59:07,477
It's true. I made some mistakes.

708
00:59:08,236 --> 00:59:09,768
But look, I got if for you.

709
00:59:15,178 --> 00:59:16,624
Oh, no, you haven't.

710
00:59:17,721 --> 00:59:22,102
I have never been interested in fakes,
as you well know.

711
00:59:25,542 --> 00:59:27,801
Have you any idea who I am?

712
00:59:30,967 --> 00:59:33,048
Let me introduce myself.

713
00:59:34,540 --> 00:59:36,450
Welcome to Hell.

714
01:00:04,987 --> 01:00:06,253
Let's try at the back.

715
01:00:25,627 --> 01:00:26,783
What a mess.

716
01:00:33,301 --> 01:00:34,556
Krieger.

717
01:00:36,063 --> 01:00:37,254
Frank.

718
01:00:50,990 --> 01:00:53,013
Oh, what kind of man kills like this?

719
01:00:54,863 --> 01:00:56,138
No ordinary one.

720
01:01:00,292 --> 01:01:01,461
I'm going to look around.

721
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:25,149
Nine names. Only Elcazor's left.

722
01:01:29,278 --> 01:01:30,970
Frank, take a look at this.

723
01:01:45,590 --> 01:01:47,894
We need to go see Leslie
about this scroll you found.

724
01:01:48,268 --> 01:01:51,455
Look, Shatter. I'm not going anywhere
until I get something to eat.

725
01:01:51,545 --> 01:01:54,592
-Now.
-Okay, okay, we'll eat first.

726
01:02:07,544 --> 01:02:09,754
Oh, Shatter, am I starved.

727
01:02:10,558 --> 01:02:13,525
Elcazor. I wonder if that's a name
or a place.

728
01:02:13,615 --> 01:02:15,773
I don't know. All I know
is I've got to get something to eat.

729
01:02:15,863 --> 01:02:17,530
What are you doing there?

730
01:02:18,547 --> 01:02:20,037
Will you kids quit hitting.

731
01:02:20,483 --> 01:02:21,884
-Hey.
-Stop it.

732
01:02:22,862 --> 01:02:25,606
Why don't you go order.
See if anyone knows what Elcazor means.

733
01:02:25,696 --> 01:02:27,518
-I'll be right back.
-Are you all right, son?

734
01:02:27,608 --> 01:02:29,424
-Thank you. Thank you, mister.
-You're welcome.

735
01:02:29,514 --> 01:02:30,807
You're welcome.

736
01:02:34,385 --> 01:02:35,661
Another American?

737
01:02:37,675 --> 01:02:38,684
The wallet.

738
01:02:48,951 --> 01:02:50,571
-What is that?
-What is this?

739
01:02:51,989 --> 01:02:54,864
-Mister, you dropped your wallet.
-I did?

740
01:02:54,954 --> 01:02:56,787
Oh, thank you.

741
01:02:56,877 --> 01:02:59,436
It's, it's just nice to meet
an honest kid.

742
01:03:00,143 --> 01:03:01,502
Thank you very much.

743
01:03:04,661 --> 01:03:06,810
Hey, Shatter, our food's getting cold,
man.

744
01:03:08,490 --> 01:03:11,584
Hey, this is the little punk
that snaked my wallet.

745
01:03:11,674 --> 01:03:13,311
-Where's my money, you little rat?
-What money?

746
01:03:13,401 --> 01:03:15,810
-You know what money.
-Here Bezi, give him his money.

747
01:03:16,671 --> 01:03:17,863
Wait a minute.

748
01:03:18,148 --> 01:03:20,140
Did anyone know
what that name Elcazor mean?

749
01:03:20,431 --> 01:03:22,335
No, no. I haven't found out yet.

750
01:03:23,293 --> 01:03:25,408
-I know the name.
-You do?

751
01:03:25,937 --> 01:03:27,424
It's a place in the north.

752
01:03:27,657 --> 01:03:28,833
Do you know how to get there?

753
01:03:29,086 --> 01:03:30,795
Yes, but it's a long way.

754
01:03:31,676 --> 01:03:32,757
Well, let's go.

755
01:03:33,853 --> 01:03:36,085
-Hey, Shatter, what about our food?
-Later.

756
01:04:09,836 --> 01:04:11,083
Who lives here?

757
01:04:11,867 --> 01:04:12,944
Dracula?

758
01:04:14,292 --> 01:04:16,487
A strange, blind monk.

759
01:04:17,630 --> 01:04:20,374
A mullah named Farouk.

760
01:04:21,401 --> 01:04:22,873
He lives over there.

761
01:04:23,633 --> 01:04:25,101
He never comes out.

762
01:04:25,313 --> 01:04:26,631
Oh, great.

763
01:04:27,134 --> 01:04:28,604
Another weirdo.

764
01:04:29,596 --> 01:04:30,924
Another holy man.

765
01:04:34,945 --> 01:04:37,200
Oh, I wait in car.

766
01:04:39,245 --> 01:04:41,504
Oh, I think I'll, I'll wait
in the car too.

767
01:04:41,623 --> 01:04:43,153
Come on. Come on.

768
01:04:44,660 --> 01:04:46,679
Oh, come on. Come on.

769
01:04:46,990 --> 01:04:49,229
That's all I ever hear is come on,
come on.

770
01:05:06,956 --> 01:05:08,204
Oh, man.

771
01:05:08,323 --> 01:05:11,067
-This is one spooky place.
-You're not afraid, are you?

772
01:05:11,333 --> 01:05:13,163
Oh, hell, no.

773
01:05:40,269 --> 01:05:41,538
Are you Farouk?

774
01:05:44,144 --> 01:05:45,641
The Rabbi Shindler is dead?

775
01:05:46,865 --> 01:05:47,930
How do you know?

776
01:05:56,831 --> 01:06:00,555
Before he left,
he spoke with me of his plan,

777
01:06:00,933 --> 01:06:04,559
to find Prosatanos with the lure
of his forgery, then kill him.

778
01:06:04,998 --> 01:06:08,061
The servant of Satan
has come to collect the nine pieces.

779
01:06:08,151 --> 01:06:10,425
Who is this servant of Satan
or Prosatanos

780
01:06:10,515 --> 01:06:11,610
or whatever you want to call him?

781
01:06:11,700 --> 01:06:13,488
It is written in many scriptures.

782
01:06:14,283 --> 01:06:17,842
"Then when the heart of mankind
has hardened with greed and hatred,

783
01:06:17,932 --> 01:06:19,859
judgement day will soon follow."

784
01:06:20,023 --> 01:06:22,242
-Judgement day?
-Armageddon,

785
01:06:22,455 --> 01:06:24,775
the fires of hell unleashed on Earth.

786
01:06:24,876 --> 01:06:28,306
You mean, worse than it is now?

787
01:06:28,657 --> 01:06:30,758
What does all this have to do
with the scepter?

788
01:06:30,848 --> 01:06:34,826
If drenched in royal blood, the scepter
is the key to the gates of hell.

789
01:06:34,916 --> 01:06:38,618
Are you trying to tell us,
that the guy that were looking for,

790
01:06:39,075 --> 01:06:41,108
really is the devil?

791
01:06:42,503 --> 01:06:45,717
Only an emissary, but one to be feared.

792
01:06:46,601 --> 01:06:48,369
Don't even tell me he ain't human.

793
01:06:48,590 --> 01:06:52,030
It is said,
that in the service of the almighty,

794
01:06:52,120 --> 01:06:53,691
one man has the power of 10.

795
01:07:00,039 --> 01:07:03,798
I must go now
and you must leave this place.

796
01:07:04,890 --> 01:07:05,909
Wait a minute.

797
01:07:05,999 --> 01:07:07,401
Who are you talking about?

798
01:07:07,743 --> 01:07:08,949
Leave.

799
01:07:09,383 --> 01:07:11,862
Leave. Leave.

800
01:07:12,818 --> 01:07:14,037
Leave!

801
01:07:18,930 --> 01:07:21,028
Either this guy's nuttier
than a Snickers,

802
01:07:21,315 --> 01:07:23,680
or there's some real heavy shit
going down.

803
01:08:17,317 --> 01:08:18,926
Pretty, isn't it?

804
01:08:27,340 --> 01:08:30,090
Hey, Frank, I can't deal
with this devil shit.

805
01:08:30,456 --> 01:08:32,235
Hey, how 'bout we go back to Chicago

806
01:08:32,325 --> 01:08:35,671
and play good cop, bad cop
with our pimps and hookers?

807
01:09:04,858 --> 01:09:06,076
Oh, shit.

808
01:09:08,405 --> 01:09:10,321
Fine. Enough is enough.

809
01:09:10,819 --> 01:09:13,241
It's time to turn this over
to the Israeli Police.

810
01:09:13,863 --> 01:09:15,342
Yeah, you're right.

811
01:09:25,102 --> 01:09:27,397
Why are we stopping, here?

812
01:09:28,154 --> 01:09:29,777
Bezi. Bezi.

813
01:09:30,994 --> 01:09:32,123
Wake up, wake up.

814
01:09:33,488 --> 01:09:34,488
Here.

815
01:09:35,444 --> 01:09:36,751
Take this and go on home.

816
01:09:37,440 --> 01:09:39,923
-Okay. See you later.
-See you, Bezi.

817
01:09:41,664 --> 01:09:42,707
So?

818
01:09:45,641 --> 01:09:49,235
It may be tricky getting in
but I think it's possible.

819
01:09:51,199 --> 01:09:54,131
Frank, you said we were going
to turn this over to the police.

820
01:09:54,221 --> 01:09:55,864
-I never said that.
-What?

821
01:09:57,382 --> 01:09:59,291
So now, I have to interpret huh?

822
01:09:59,501 --> 01:10:01,092
Come on, Cal,
this is not the time to be...

823
01:10:01,182 --> 01:10:03,271
No, no, it is the time, Frank.

824
01:10:04,076 --> 01:10:07,360
I mean look, you conned me
into coming to this dammed country.

825
01:10:07,450 --> 01:10:09,792
You're been conning me
ever since we got here.

826
01:10:09,882 --> 01:10:14,578
And now, you want me to help you bust
into some damn cop shop?

827
01:10:15,557 --> 01:10:18,166
Hey man, look, why, why, why don't you
just cut my nuts off

828
01:10:18,256 --> 01:10:20,368
with a dull-assed butter knife.

829
01:10:20,715 --> 01:10:22,139
I'm your partner, man.

830
01:10:22,806 --> 01:10:25,293
I deserved some respect, you know?

831
01:10:26,647 --> 01:10:30,016
If I didn't respect you,
you wouldn't be my partner.

832
01:10:32,838 --> 01:10:33,979
All right.

833
01:10:40,017 --> 01:10:44,368
So, what the hell are we breaking
into a police station for, huh?

834
01:11:14,651 --> 01:11:16,213
Shatter, I don't understand.

835
01:11:16,303 --> 01:11:18,802
Why couldn't we just, you know,
why couldn't we just...

836
01:11:18,892 --> 01:11:20,174
Just check the file.

837
01:11:30,571 --> 01:11:33,764
You know, Shatter, these files,
they're all going to be in Hebrew, man.

838
01:11:33,854 --> 01:11:36,012
The file is Interpol, its international.

839
01:11:36,102 --> 01:11:37,506
Oh, great!

840
01:11:37,724 --> 01:11:39,223
That's going to be a big help.

841
01:11:39,423 --> 01:11:42,859
French, and Japanese and whatever else.

842
01:11:55,719 --> 01:11:57,128
Shatter, what is...

843
01:11:59,905 --> 01:12:01,986
Hey, baby, what's happening?

844
01:12:07,637 --> 01:12:08,637
Good night.

845
01:12:09,578 --> 01:12:13,631
Shatter, you are getting us in
deeper and deeper, man.

846
01:12:15,160 --> 01:12:17,254
Oh, I'll take that.

847
01:12:17,712 --> 01:12:19,339
-Cal, come here.
-What?

848
01:12:22,875 --> 01:12:26,303
-Eight. There's eight dead bodies in here.
-So?

849
01:12:26,737 --> 01:12:28,350
Eight Holy Men.

850
01:12:29,381 --> 01:12:31,226
Now, Farouk, makes nine.

851
01:12:32,809 --> 01:12:34,653
Nine pieces. Think about it.

852
01:12:34,743 --> 01:12:37,924
Nine pieces and the scepter's complete.

853
01:12:38,354 --> 01:12:40,967
All that's needed is royal blood.

854
01:12:42,160 --> 01:12:43,706
I'm curious about something.

855
01:12:45,910 --> 01:12:49,498
Yeah, curious. The last time
you were curious, somebody got killed.

856
01:12:56,959 --> 01:12:59,113
-Hello?
-Oh, this is Sergeant Shatter.

857
01:12:59,203 --> 01:13:00,604
Is Professor Lockley there?

858
01:13:01,030 --> 01:13:03,110
He's not here Frank. This is Leslie.

859
01:13:03,200 --> 01:13:05,437
Oh, hi, Leslie. Maybe you can help me.

860
01:13:05,769 --> 01:13:09,033
I need Professor Lockley's
lecture schedule for the last two years.

861
01:13:09,126 --> 01:13:10,382
Let me check.

862
01:13:17,700 --> 01:13:18,944
All right.

863
01:13:19,167 --> 01:13:24,600
Most recently, June 8th,1992, Rome, Italy.

864
01:13:24,690 --> 01:13:26,045
Rome, Italy.

865
01:13:26,688 --> 01:13:27,688
Oh, bingo.

866
01:13:27,907 --> 01:13:31,227
-Okay.
-Peru, the previous February.

867
01:13:31,369 --> 01:13:32,369
Peru.

868
01:13:32,793 --> 01:13:37,060
-Okay.
-October 18th, 1991, he was in Manila.

869
01:13:37,150 --> 01:13:38,419
Manila.

870
01:13:39,333 --> 01:13:42,452
Christ, Shatter,
these are all the same dates.

871
01:13:43,211 --> 01:13:44,568
Okay, that's enough for now, Leslie.

872
01:13:44,658 --> 01:13:47,257
-Do you know where Professor Lockley is?
-No, I don't.

873
01:13:47,347 --> 01:13:48,606
Do you have his address?

874
01:13:48,867 --> 01:13:50,546
134 Hyacon Street.

875
01:13:50,994 --> 01:13:53,517
-What's this all about?
-I want you to stay there, Leslie.

876
01:13:53,607 --> 01:13:54,780
I'll call you later.

877
01:13:55,098 --> 01:13:56,692
-Why?
-I don't want to alarm you.

878
01:13:56,782 --> 01:14:00,828
But at this point, Professor Lockley
is a murder suspect.

879
01:14:03,187 --> 01:14:04,717
That's not possible.

880
01:14:05,235 --> 01:14:07,964
Professor Lockley is a friend
and a colleague.

881
01:14:08,054 --> 01:14:09,706
I want you to trust me on this, Leslie.

882
01:14:10,667 --> 01:14:13,411
All right. I'll do as you ask
but you're wrong.

883
01:14:13,881 --> 01:14:15,137
I know you're wrong.

884
01:14:15,365 --> 01:14:16,423
We'll see.

885
01:14:16,681 --> 01:14:18,158
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

886
01:14:20,860 --> 01:14:22,145
Let's get out of here.

887
01:14:26,365 --> 01:14:28,749
I'm sorry. I didn't know you were here.

888
01:14:29,072 --> 01:14:31,321
I've never been far from you, Princess.

889
01:14:32,011 --> 01:14:34,054
You're much too important to me.

890
01:14:34,949 --> 01:14:36,192
As you are to me.

891
01:14:36,396 --> 01:14:38,315
Hardly in the same way, I think.

892
01:14:40,744 --> 01:14:42,509
So, what did Frank want?

893
01:14:44,148 --> 01:14:46,701
-He just wanted to..
-He found me out, hasn't he?

894
01:14:51,057 --> 01:14:52,360
What do you mean?

895
01:14:54,658 --> 01:14:56,285
You know exactly what I mean.

896
01:14:57,062 --> 01:14:59,057
You're scaring me, Professor Lockley.

897
01:14:59,433 --> 01:15:01,379
You have nothing to fear, Princess.

898
01:15:03,071 --> 01:15:05,285
You will have the opportunity
to elevate me

899
01:15:05,375 --> 01:15:07,639
to a place I've awaited for centuries.

900
01:15:09,034 --> 01:15:10,810
I am Prosatanos...

901
01:15:13,136 --> 01:15:15,054
your passage to eternity.

902
01:15:25,617 --> 01:15:26,836
This is it.

903
01:15:30,545 --> 01:15:32,968
-We'll let's go catch us a killer.
-Let's go.

904
01:16:24,423 --> 01:16:25,732
Looks like he's not here.

905
01:16:27,518 --> 01:16:29,198
Let's look around
and see what we can find.

906
01:17:02,639 --> 01:17:04,168
Hey, Cal, come take a look at this.

907
01:17:07,299 --> 01:17:08,631
Who does that look like to you?

908
01:17:11,082 --> 01:17:12,414
Oh, is that Leslie?

909
01:17:13,261 --> 01:17:15,212
Wow, she looks like royalty.

910
01:17:23,851 --> 01:17:25,269
Who are you calling now?

911
01:17:29,319 --> 01:17:32,047
Shalom. Professor Lockleys office.
Clarit speaking.

912
01:17:32,137 --> 01:17:33,523
Oh, this is Sergeant Shatter.

913
01:17:33,884 --> 01:17:35,117
Let me speak to Leslie.

914
01:17:35,291 --> 01:17:37,375
She's not here, Sergeant.
She left some time ago.

915
01:17:37,498 --> 01:17:39,968
I just saw a picture of Leslie
with an older man.

916
01:17:40,058 --> 01:17:41,847
A very distinguished looking fellow.

917
01:17:42,210 --> 01:17:44,106
Oh, yes, that's her father.

918
01:17:44,443 --> 01:17:46,532
Sir Edmond Hawkins, the Duke of Claymore.

919
01:17:46,715 --> 01:17:47,748
A duke?

920
01:17:48,064 --> 01:17:49,433
Her father's a duke?

921
01:17:49,865 --> 01:17:51,051
Royal blood.

922
01:17:51,203 --> 01:17:52,218
Where did she go?

923
01:17:52,308 --> 01:17:54,517
To the excavation site
with Professor Lockley.

924
01:18:03,003 --> 01:18:04,525
Frank, what are we up against?

925
01:18:05,212 --> 01:18:06,669
We'll know soon enough.

926
01:18:11,427 --> 01:18:16,726
Oh, divine master,
I restore this scepter in your honor.

927
01:18:16,923 --> 01:18:20,976
The key to you resurrection and power.

928
01:18:27,530 --> 01:18:30,566
May the union of this being and my spirit

929
01:18:30,858 --> 01:18:33,719
transcend and release your vital presence

930
01:18:34,162 --> 01:18:38,641
into the world once again
to reign forever.

931
01:18:51,405 --> 01:18:55,310
I prepare to anoint my spirit
with this royal blood.

932
01:18:57,021 --> 01:19:02,102
I prepare to anoint my spirit
with this royal blood.

933
01:19:02,942 --> 01:19:07,830
I prepare to anoint my spirit
with this royal blood.

934
01:19:14,668 --> 01:19:15,838
Here, grab a light.

935
01:19:47,544 --> 01:19:49,269
I think we found it.

936
01:19:50,308 --> 01:19:51,878
What the hell?

937
01:20:00,833 --> 01:20:02,478
-Oh, there's Leslie.
-Hold it.

938
01:20:03,030 --> 01:20:05,678
-What?
-Does it feel like a trap to you?

939
01:20:07,713 --> 01:20:09,043
Yeah.

940
01:20:09,445 --> 01:20:10,637
You're right.

941
01:20:12,513 --> 01:20:15,321
It's a little too easy.

942
01:20:39,387 --> 01:20:40,541
Get off.

943
01:20:40,631 --> 01:20:42,604
I said, get off me. #*@% off.

944
01:20:45,032 --> 01:20:46,299
Take that!

945
01:21:09,046 --> 01:21:10,548
Shatter!

946
01:21:13,477 --> 01:21:14,614
Hey!

947
01:21:49,929 --> 01:21:51,734
-You okay?
-Yeah.

948
01:21:53,928 --> 01:21:55,608
Let's get out of here
before he comes back.

949
01:21:55,701 --> 01:21:56,882
Yeah.

950
01:22:02,523 --> 01:22:04,856
Leslie. Wake up, wake up, wake up.

951
01:22:05,842 --> 01:22:07,097
Leslie, wake up.

952
01:22:08,617 --> 01:22:11,358
Is there anything in the myth
that tells us how to kill this guy?

953
01:22:14,656 --> 01:22:15,910
Come on, think.

954
01:22:16,518 --> 01:22:17,677
Think, Leslie.

955
01:22:18,831 --> 01:22:20,189
How do we kill this guy?

956
01:22:27,157 --> 01:22:33,338
Prosatanos, the servant of Satan,
brought to Earth to end it here.

957
01:22:34,011 --> 01:22:35,408
Armageddon.

958
01:22:35,726 --> 01:22:41,605
That which he covets
shall prove to be his demise.

959
01:22:42,608 --> 01:22:43,725
What else?

960
01:23:09,703 --> 01:23:12,610
-Where the hell did he go? Again.
-Beats the hell out of me.

961
01:23:12,865 --> 01:23:14,538
Let's get Leslie and get out of here.

962
01:23:19,714 --> 01:23:22,040
What's happening? Where is he?

963
01:23:30,687 --> 01:23:32,011
What do we do now?

964
01:23:33,516 --> 01:23:34,839
Good cop, bad cop?

965
01:23:36,134 --> 01:23:37,355
Funny.

966
01:23:37,501 --> 01:23:42,329
Think. That which he covets
shall prove to be his demise.

967
01:23:42,814 --> 01:23:45,969
That which be covets
shall prove to be his demise.

968
01:23:46,163 --> 01:23:47,303
The scepter.

969
01:23:47,393 --> 01:23:49,018
The scepter will kill him!

970
01:24:02,544 --> 01:24:04,080
Eat this!

971
01:25:33,314 --> 01:25:37,369
<i>As it was written,
from the west, again, salvation came.</i>

972
01:25:37,750 --> 01:25:39,251
Two soldiers of another kind

973
01:25:39,341 --> 01:25:42,144
<i>have confronted and destroyed the beast,
with his own weapon.</i>

974
01:25:42,850 --> 01:25:46,159
<i>So it has been done, it was passed to me
by my father's father.</i>

975
01:25:46,348 --> 01:25:47,634
<i>I must take unto myself</i>

976
01:25:47,724 --> 01:25:49,158
<i>the shattered scepter of the demon</i>

977
01:25:49,331 --> 01:25:52,375
<i>to scatter the elements
from whence the came</i>

978
01:25:52,564 --> 01:25:54,436
<i>so that neither human eyes,
nor heaven's light</i>

979
01:25:54,526 --> 01:25:56,785
<i>should ever again fall upon them.</i>

980
01:26:10,925 --> 01:26:12,070
So, what are you plans?

981
01:26:12,160 --> 01:26:13,910
I've got some work to finish up here.

982
01:26:15,116 --> 01:26:17,144
And I hope I will be seeing you
in Chicago.

983
01:26:17,234 --> 01:26:20,196
<i>-Seven, six, five, four...</i>
-You will.

984
01:26:20,344 --> 01:26:21,781
-Great.
<i>-three, two...</i>

985
01:26:21,871 --> 01:26:24,588
They won! They won!

986
01:26:24,678 --> 01:26:25,898
The Bulls won!

987
01:26:25,988 --> 01:26:29,194
Hey, Shatter, Shatter, the Bulls won
the championship.

988
01:26:29,284 --> 01:26:31,062
I can't believe it. I can't...

989
01:26:33,611 --> 01:26:35,860
-They won!
-We've got a plane to catch, Cal.

990
01:26:36,565 --> 01:26:37,973
-You take care, Bezi.
-Thanks.

991
01:26:38,063 --> 01:26:39,238
All right.

992
01:26:41,037 --> 01:26:43,326
-See you in Chicago, okay.
-I've got to go, buddy.

993
01:26:44,415 --> 01:26:47,762
But now, I want you to remember
what I told you, okay?

994
01:26:48,037 --> 01:26:50,842
A life of crime is not the way to go.

995
01:26:51,471 --> 01:26:52,641
All right?

996
01:26:56,190 --> 01:26:57,811
Oh, well.

997
01:26:58,555 --> 01:26:59,850
I've got to, buddy.

998
01:27:02,494 --> 01:27:03,893
-You take care.
-Bye.

999
01:27:12,858 --> 01:27:14,158
Are you missing anything?

1000
01:27:17,422 --> 01:27:18,779
Bezi!
