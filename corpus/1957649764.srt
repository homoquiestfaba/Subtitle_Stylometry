1
00:00:02,557 --> 00:00:05,737

(upbeat music)

4
00:00:12,096 --> 00:00:13,347
- You better you prick.

(upbeat music)

9
00:00:24,556 --> 00:00:29,114
- [Man] I pity the poor
bastard who killed her.

10
00:00:29,114 --> 00:00:30,596
- Where's the money?

11
00:00:30,596 --> 00:00:31,847
- In a safe place.

12
00:00:31,847 --> 00:00:33,865
- How can I let you live?

13
00:00:33,865 --> 00:00:35,145
- [Man] Why didn't he just run?

14
00:00:35,145 --> 00:00:36,661
- I don't think he want's to live.

15
00:00:36,661 --> 00:00:39,244
(upbeat music)

16
00:00:49,122 --> 00:00:51,231
- [Woman] Somebody's been following me.

17
00:00:51,231 --> 00:00:55,929
- I'm already a dead man and
I'm taking everybody with me.

18
00:00:55,929 --> 00:00:57,530
- [Man] I just want my fuckin' money.

19
00:00:57,530 --> 00:00:59,250
- [Man] Is a million worth dying for?

20
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:00,861
- Give me your gun I'm

21
00:01:00,861 --> 00:01:03,444
(upbeat music)

22
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:06,950
- Don't say I didn't warn you.

23
00:01:12,049 --> 00:01:14,799
(dramatic music)

24
00:04:24,353 --> 00:04:26,494
- I'm sorry Tonio but I'm
taking Anna and the money

25
00:04:26,494 --> 00:04:29,265
far away from you and the family.

26
00:04:29,265 --> 00:04:31,598
So please just hand it over.

27
00:04:40,243 --> 00:04:44,425
- Wherever you go, however long
it takes Blake I'll find you

28
00:04:44,425 --> 00:04:47,083
and I'll kill you, then
I'll take Anna back.

29
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:51,250
- Yeah, yeah I know, that's
why I have to kill you.

30
00:04:53,425 --> 00:04:54,465
- [Woman] Blake don't!

31
00:04:54,465 --> 00:04:55,298
- No Anna.

32
00:04:55,298 --> 00:04:56,174
(gun firing)

33
00:04:56,174 --> 00:04:58,507
(screaming)

34
00:05:01,454 --> 00:05:03,537
(crying)

35
00:05:10,973 --> 00:05:11,806

40
00:05:20,771 --> 00:05:22,062

41

(screaming)

42
00:05:24,462 --> 00:05:25,439
Anna, Anna.

43
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:26,982

00:05:26,982 --> 00:05:30,020
- Anna you're mine listen Anna.

00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:33,680
- Blake, I love.

47
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,930
(crunches)

48
00:05:37,472 --> 00:05:39,722
(coughing)

49
00:05:41,471 --> 00:05:43,971
- Anna, Anna I didn't mean to.

50
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:49,623
Anna, Anna I didn't mean to.

51
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,701
- I'll see you in hell Tonio.

52
00:05:59,701 --> 00:06:02,451
(dramatic music)

53
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,667
(phone ringing)

54
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:20,251
- Joe Average.

55
00:06:20,251 --> 00:06:21,584
Morning captain.

56
00:06:22,829 --> 00:06:23,662
When?

57
00:06:24,988 --> 00:06:26,655
Browning on his way?

58
00:06:28,779 --> 00:06:30,862
Okay I'll meet him there.

59
00:06:35,158 --> 00:06:37,456
(clicks)

60
00:06:37,456 --> 00:06:38,289
Shit.

61
00:06:51,823 --> 00:06:53,674
I got two stiffs waiting for me.

62
00:06:53,674 --> 00:06:55,325
Can we talk about this later?

63
00:06:55,325 --> 00:06:57,033
Maybe take in a ball game?

64
00:06:57,033 --> 00:06:59,200
- I'll think about it Joe.

65
00:07:00,114 --> 00:07:01,445
- I wanna work this out.

66
00:07:01,445 --> 00:07:02,855
- Oh go to work Joe.

67
00:07:02,855 --> 00:07:07,022
(crying out)
(splashes)

68
00:07:11,065 --> 00:07:12,622
- [Man] Tell him I said hello.

69
00:07:12,622 --> 00:07:13,705
- [Man] Yeah.

70
00:07:17,094 --> 00:07:19,182
- What do we got Browning?

71
00:07:19,182 --> 00:07:20,123
- What else Joe?

72
00:07:20,123 --> 00:07:20,956
Murder.

73
00:07:20,956 --> 00:07:22,275
- Who is he?

74
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:24,905
- Passport says Blake Johnson.

75
00:07:24,905 --> 00:07:26,235
- Her?

76
00:07:26,235 --> 00:07:28,355
- Car down the hill had her purse in it,

77
00:07:28,355 --> 00:07:31,188
passport, license Anna Martel, 22,

78
00:07:33,395 --> 00:07:34,893
two sets of luggage in the car.

79
00:07:34,893 --> 00:07:36,974
- Martel as in Paris Martel?

80
00:07:36,974 --> 00:07:38,843
- I'm afraid so.

81
00:07:38,843 --> 00:07:41,185
One of her old man's cars.

82
00:07:41,185 --> 00:07:44,385
I pity the poor bastard who killed her.

83
00:07:44,385 --> 00:07:46,703
- Well maybe she pulled the trigger.

84
00:07:46,703 --> 00:07:48,905
- No, no it wasn't fired.

85
00:07:48,905 --> 00:07:51,185
There's some foot prints though.

86
00:07:51,185 --> 00:07:53,785
One set went running off that way.

87
00:07:53,785 --> 00:07:55,868
Male about 180 size 11's.

88
00:07:57,483 --> 00:07:58,945
- Whose the fourth?

89
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:01,705
- Might possibly be our anonymous caller.

90
00:08:01,705 --> 00:08:05,872
Female, found the bodies,
robbed 'em and phoned it in.

91
00:08:07,755 --> 00:08:10,422
No cards or money in the wallet.

92
00:08:12,377 --> 00:08:13,960
- I love this town.

93
00:08:16,065 --> 00:08:19,385
- I'll get back with ya
after we put 'em on the slab.

94
00:08:19,385 --> 00:08:23,526
Oh and I'll let you break
the news to Paris Martel.

95
00:08:23,526 --> 00:08:25,326
- Thank you ever so much.

96
00:08:25,326 --> 00:08:28,076
(dramatic music)

97
00:09:19,047 --> 00:09:20,069
What the hell are you doing?

98
00:09:20,069 --> 00:09:21,990
- I'm moving out.

99
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:23,809
- What are you talking about?

100
00:09:23,809 --> 00:09:26,518
- Which part of the sentence
didn't you understand Joe?

101
00:09:26,518 --> 00:09:27,619
- I thought we were talking this out

102
00:09:27,619 --> 00:09:29,988
and going to a ball game?

103
00:09:29,988 --> 00:09:34,681
- It was never we, you don't
love me, I'm outta here.

104
00:09:34,681 --> 00:09:35,514
- Melissa.

105
00:09:35,514 --> 00:09:37,887
- Anything you never do.

106
00:09:37,887 --> 00:09:41,859
- Melissa we're cops you
know what that does to us.

107
00:09:41,859 --> 00:09:44,428
- Yeah it makes some of us assholes.

108
00:09:44,428 --> 00:09:46,761
- You had the affair not me.

109
00:09:47,689 --> 00:09:49,288
- Well if you would have
fucked me once in a while

110
00:09:49,288 --> 00:09:51,367
maybe I wouldn't a.

111
00:09:51,367 --> 00:09:52,258
- Is this what it's all about?

112
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:53,091
Sex?

113
00:09:54,716 --> 00:09:56,757
- It's about being a human being.

114
00:09:56,757 --> 00:09:58,429
It's about being partners.

115
00:09:58,429 --> 00:10:00,269
It's about being a husband

116
00:10:00,269 --> 00:10:02,688
something that you know nothing about.

117
00:10:02,688 --> 00:10:04,296
- Well no one's perfect.

118
00:10:04,296 --> 00:10:06,736
(banging)

119
00:10:06,736 --> 00:10:08,819
- That you do know about.

120
00:10:10,395 --> 00:10:12,267
- God damn it you're still my wife.

121
00:10:12,267 --> 00:10:14,395
- You'll hear from my lawyer.

122
00:10:14,395 --> 00:10:15,806
- Where will you stay?

123
00:10:15,806 --> 00:10:19,195
- Maybe Skeeze's maybe my dad's.

124
00:10:19,195 --> 00:10:21,576
In any case don't bother calling.

125
00:10:21,576 --> 00:10:23,274
- Why are you doing this to me?

126
00:10:23,274 --> 00:10:24,275
- I'm not doing anything you haven't

127
00:10:24,275 --> 00:10:27,176
already done to yourself.

128
00:10:27,176 --> 00:10:29,715
- You can't stay at Skeeze's he's a punk.

129
00:10:29,715 --> 00:10:34,147
- Well at least he's man enough
to hold me when I need it.

130
00:10:34,147 --> 00:10:36,507
- You can't go from one cop to another.

131
00:10:36,507 --> 00:10:38,026
How would that look?

132
00:10:38,026 --> 00:10:40,155
- I don't give a rats ass.

133
00:10:40,155 --> 00:10:42,123
Maybe you should go back to your partner,

134
00:10:42,123 --> 00:10:46,040
better yet maybe you
should go back to the bar.

135
00:10:46,907 --> 00:10:48,667
- I invested in that bar so we'd have

136
00:10:48,667 --> 00:10:50,115
something to retire on.

137
00:10:50,115 --> 00:10:52,214
- You're not gonna live that long Joe.

138
00:10:52,214 --> 00:10:53,631
- Take that back.

139
00:11:01,747 --> 00:11:02,875
Take that back.

140
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:04,458
- Go fuck yourself.

141
00:11:28,231 --> 00:11:29,780
- What is this seat taken?

142
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:32,500
- Yeah there's a gorgeous
pigeon sitting right there.

143
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:35,417
- Speaking of pigeons, take a look.

144
00:11:39,481 --> 00:11:43,181
- Oh, not bad, you casting a movie?

145
00:11:43,181 --> 00:11:47,031
- Yeah it's all about two dead
lovers in a field of dreams.

146
00:11:47,031 --> 00:11:48,941
- So how does it end?

147
00:11:48,941 --> 00:11:52,350
- I don't know but it's got
some colorful characters.

148
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:53,969
- Give me a hint.

149
00:11:53,969 --> 00:11:57,831
- Well for starters that
is Mrs. Blake Johnson aka

150
00:11:57,831 --> 00:11:59,441
Theresa Fields.

151
00:11:59,441 --> 00:12:00,550
- So?

152
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:03,763
- So, the Theresa Fields, Miss Wholesome,

153
00:12:03,763 --> 00:12:05,752
Miss Million Dollar Huckster.

154
00:12:05,752 --> 00:12:06,585
- Okay?

155
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:10,981
- Johnson slapped a
restraining order on her

156
00:12:10,981 --> 00:12:13,209
just to keep her away from his place.

157
00:12:13,209 --> 00:12:14,381
- Now that's a twist.

158
00:12:14,381 --> 00:12:17,100
- Yeah I thought you might like
to ask her a few questions.

159
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:17,933
- I do.

160
00:12:19,443 --> 00:12:21,421
And not just about dead husbands.

161
00:12:21,421 --> 00:12:24,211
(laughing)

162
00:12:24,211 --> 00:12:26,843
- Both her and Johnson
are from outside Huston,

163
00:12:26,843 --> 00:12:29,470
been separated five years,
he's a freelance trucker

164
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:31,671
who doesn't own a rig.

165
00:12:31,671 --> 00:12:33,531
- So who does he freelance for?

166
00:12:33,531 --> 00:12:34,891
- So ask his wife.

167
00:12:34,891 --> 00:12:37,741
Oh this'll make your day.

168
00:12:37,741 --> 00:12:41,574
Miss Martel was engaged
to a one Tonio Mandio.

169
00:12:43,642 --> 00:12:45,731
Paris Martel's dock foreman.

170
00:12:45,731 --> 00:12:46,564
- Shit.

171
00:12:48,931 --> 00:12:50,901
I'm not in the mood for this today.

172
00:12:50,901 --> 00:12:53,484
(gentle music)

173
00:13:20,517 --> 00:13:23,267
(dramatic music)

174
00:13:58,971 --> 00:14:01,131
I'm looking for Tonio

175
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:03,924
(mumbling)

176
00:14:03,924 --> 00:14:04,757
Come on.

177
00:14:04,757 --> 00:14:06,164
(mumbling)

178
00:14:06,164 --> 00:14:07,103
Where's he at?

179
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:08,353
Do you know where he's at.

180
00:14:08,353 --> 00:14:09,186
- No.

181
00:14:09,186 --> 00:14:11,472
- I got five bucks you
can tell me where he's at.

182
00:14:11,472 --> 00:14:12,305
(mumbling)

183
00:14:12,305 --> 00:14:13,138
Nope.

184
00:14:13,138 --> 00:14:13,971
(mumbling)

185
00:14:13,971 --> 00:14:14,804
Where's he at man?

186
00:14:14,804 --> 00:14:15,637
I need to know.

187
00:14:15,637 --> 00:14:19,769
- You got to go down here,
to the left, then go up

188
00:14:19,769 --> 00:14:21,158
there he is.

189
00:14:21,158 --> 00:14:23,325
(mumbles)

190
00:14:28,678 --> 00:14:29,790
- Take care, thank you.

191
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:32,540
(dramatic music)

192
00:17:02,167 --> 00:17:05,334
(marching band music)

193
00:17:11,973 --> 00:17:14,723
(dramatic music)

194
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:29,943
(crying out)

195
00:17:29,943 --> 00:17:30,811
- [Man] That's enough!

196
00:17:30,811 --> 00:17:31,783
(thudding)
(crying out)

197
00:17:31,783 --> 00:17:32,950
That's enough!

198
00:17:37,143 --> 00:17:39,001
Where's the money?

199
00:17:39,001 --> 00:17:40,918
- It's in a safe place.

200
00:17:43,046 --> 00:17:45,713
- Don't kill him until he talks.

201
00:17:51,855 --> 00:17:53,863
- Let me get him once for Anna.

202
00:17:53,863 --> 00:17:58,030
(thudding)
(crying out)

203
00:18:32,394 --> 00:18:33,977
- I came to you for forgiveness

204
00:18:33,977 --> 00:18:36,068
tell Walter my life for the money.

205
00:18:36,068 --> 00:18:37,857
- You killed my daughter.

206
00:18:37,857 --> 00:18:40,196
How am I gonna let you live?

207
00:18:40,196 --> 00:18:41,696
- Then we all die.

208
00:18:44,094 --> 00:18:46,261
(tinging)

209
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:49,796
- Put a price on him.

210
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:50,629
Alive!

211
00:19:02,846 --> 00:19:04,263
Yeah he got away.

212
00:19:05,738 --> 00:19:07,696
You'll get your money Walter.

213
00:19:07,696 --> 00:19:10,529
Don't make threats you can't keep.

214
00:19:12,237 --> 00:19:15,320
- Still beating your employees Paris?

215
00:19:27,487 --> 00:19:28,477
Where is he?

216
00:19:28,477 --> 00:19:29,665
- I don't know what you're talking about.

217
00:19:29,665 --> 00:19:30,738
- You know what I'm talking about.

218
00:19:30,738 --> 00:19:32,167
- Why don't you get off my ass Joe.

219
00:19:32,167 --> 00:19:34,277
- I'm gonna be on your ass
so close you're gonna never

220
00:19:34,277 --> 00:19:35,378
be able to smell again.

221
00:19:35,378 --> 00:19:37,157
- How much you want buddy?

222
00:19:37,157 --> 00:19:38,786
Why don't you keep your
fucking cops outta here,

223
00:19:38,786 --> 00:19:39,619
keep your badge clean.

224
00:19:39,619 --> 00:19:40,906
- Hey are you offering me money for this?

225
00:19:40,906 --> 00:19:41,746
Is that's what's going on.

226
00:19:41,746 --> 00:19:42,579
- Is that what I said?

227
00:19:42,579 --> 00:19:44,007
- Yeah you asked me how much I want.

228
00:19:44,007 --> 00:19:47,377
- I want you off my property
unless you got a warrant.

229
00:19:47,377 --> 00:19:48,936
You clear out of this, this is a family.

230
00:19:48,936 --> 00:19:52,407
- Listen you see him you give me a call.

231
00:19:52,407 --> 00:19:53,407
You hear me?

232
00:20:02,415 --> 00:20:05,374
(train clattering)

233
00:20:05,374 --> 00:20:08,124
(dramatic music)

234
00:21:19,569 --> 00:21:23,736
You know looking for your
connection he's not here.

235
00:21:25,749 --> 00:21:26,999
I need a favor.

236
00:21:29,209 --> 00:21:30,458
- Yeah you always do.

237
00:21:30,458 --> 00:21:31,618
- Tonio alive.

238
00:21:31,618 --> 00:21:33,157
(laughs)

239
00:21:33,157 --> 00:21:35,690
I say something funny?

240
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:38,190
- Everybody wants Tonio alive.

241
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:41,797
(gun firing)
(crying out)

242
00:21:41,797 --> 00:21:44,547
(dramatic music)

243
00:22:06,544 --> 00:22:08,013
(tires squealing)

244
00:22:08,013 --> 00:22:10,763
(dramatic music)

245
00:22:56,816 --> 00:22:59,314
- We have an uncomfortable situation here.

246
00:22:59,314 --> 00:23:01,215
- What's your name cop?

247
00:23:01,215 --> 00:23:02,798
- Joe, Joe Average.

248
00:23:03,696 --> 00:23:06,446
(dramatic music)

249
00:23:37,688 --> 00:23:39,179
- Hey cop.

250
00:23:39,179 --> 00:23:43,346
(thudding)
(crying out)

251
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:48,456
Don't make me a cop killer.

252
00:23:48,456 --> 00:23:51,206
(dramatic music)

253
00:25:10,628 --> 00:25:14,795
(thudding)
(crying out)

254
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:21,041
You're not very good at
this game are you Joe?

255
00:25:21,041 --> 00:25:22,488
- Fuck you.

256
00:25:22,488 --> 00:25:25,281
- (laughs) Is that anyway to
talk to a lovesick killer?

257
00:25:25,281 --> 00:25:27,241
- Get it over with.

258
00:25:27,241 --> 00:25:28,700
- Would you shoot me if
I was lying in the street

259
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:29,700
with no gun?

260
00:25:30,978 --> 00:25:32,449
- Maybe.

261
00:25:32,449 --> 00:25:34,699
- Promise me one thing Joe.

262
00:25:35,921 --> 00:25:36,919
- Okay.

263
00:25:36,919 --> 00:25:41,002
- When this is all over
with, make sure I'm dead.

264
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:47,609
- One way or the other.

265
00:25:47,609 --> 00:25:50,359
(dramatic music)

266
00:27:12,279 --> 00:27:14,529
(rustling)

267
00:27:16,168 --> 00:27:19,150
- Hey mother fucker what
you got in that bag?

268
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:20,779
- Ah a million dollars.

269
00:27:20,779 --> 00:27:22,899
- Yeah and my mother's rockdefeller.

270
00:27:22,899 --> 00:27:25,390
- No really man take it it's yours.

271
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:26,473
- Yeah right.

272
00:27:29,838 --> 00:27:32,880
Guess what asshole we're
picking door number two.

273
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,510
Your ass is worth 10 grand.

274
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:39,677
(crying out)
(thudding)

275
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:02,493
(squishing)

276
00:28:06,758 --> 00:28:10,925
(thudding)
(crying out)

277
00:28:19,699 --> 00:28:22,470
(gun firing)

278
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:25,220
(dramatic music)

279
00:28:43,403 --> 00:28:45,552
- Anyone we know Browning?

280
00:28:45,552 --> 00:28:48,682
- Local boys, shot while lying here,

281
00:28:48,682 --> 00:28:51,099
stabbed and beat up the rest.

282
00:28:51,992 --> 00:28:53,632
- Anybody see anything?

283
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:56,021
- No one's come forward.

284
00:28:56,021 --> 00:28:57,802
- Tonio's on the run.

285
00:28:57,802 --> 00:28:59,533
Word on the street Paris posted 10 grand

286
00:28:59,533 --> 00:29:01,283
to bring him in alive.

287
00:29:01,283 --> 00:29:02,763
- Alive?

288
00:29:02,763 --> 00:29:04,813
- Yeah that's what I said.

289
00:29:04,813 --> 00:29:07,896
These guys probably tried to collect.

290
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:10,963
- I'll run ballistics and
see if I can match these up

291
00:29:10,963 --> 00:29:12,612
with the two this morning.

292
00:29:12,612 --> 00:29:15,152
- There's another one waiting
for you when you get back.

293
00:29:15,152 --> 00:29:17,312
One of my snitches.

294
00:29:17,312 --> 00:29:18,145
- Sorry.

295
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:20,843
Any word on Theresa Fields?

296
00:29:20,843 --> 00:29:22,883
- I made an appointment with her agent.

297
00:29:22,883 --> 00:29:24,872
Now if you don't mind
I'd like to go clean up.

298
00:29:24,872 --> 00:29:26,705
- Joe watch your step.

299
00:29:27,701 --> 00:29:29,533
- I'm not worried about Martel.

300
00:29:29,533 --> 00:29:31,951
- I meant with the actress.

301
00:29:31,951 --> 00:29:33,203
- I'll carry my gun.

302
00:29:33,203 --> 00:29:35,953
(dramatic music)

303
00:29:44,118 --> 00:29:46,270
Detective Joe Average.

304
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:47,103
Homicide.

305
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:52,861
I called your agent he
told me where to find you.

306
00:29:52,861 --> 00:29:55,251
- Now look if this is about
Blake I have nothing to say.

307
00:29:55,251 --> 00:29:57,339
- When was the last
time you spoke with him?

308
00:29:57,339 --> 00:29:59,141
- Months ago.

309
00:29:59,141 --> 00:30:01,952
- Why did he have a
restraining order on you?

310
00:30:01,952 --> 00:30:03,400
- Because there was a
time in our relationship

311
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,781
I would've killed him myself.

312
00:30:05,781 --> 00:30:06,614
- Did you?

313
00:30:08,392 --> 00:30:10,949
Do you have any idea who he worked for?

314
00:30:10,949 --> 00:30:13,629
- Drove trucks outta
Mexico that's all I know.

315
00:30:13,629 --> 00:30:16,212
He had vegetables on his brain.

316
00:30:17,326 --> 00:30:18,801
- Look it's hot do you mind stopping?

317
00:30:18,801 --> 00:30:19,936
- I don't wanna cool down.

318
00:30:19,936 --> 00:30:21,375
- You either cool down
here or in a holding pen

319
00:30:21,375 --> 00:30:22,624
take your pick.

320
00:30:22,624 --> 00:30:25,264
- Look cop don't get tough with me.

321
00:30:25,264 --> 00:30:27,597
- Who was Blake driving for?

322
00:30:29,925 --> 00:30:31,936
- He mentioned a Walter Dunning once.

323
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:33,424
- That's better.

324
00:30:33,424 --> 00:30:35,435
- Look Blake was a son
of a bitch and a loser

325
00:30:35,435 --> 00:30:36,268
now if you don't mind I'd really--

326
00:30:36,268 --> 00:30:38,195
- He was about to run
off with another woman.

327
00:30:38,195 --> 00:30:39,744
- He was always running off with something

328
00:30:39,744 --> 00:30:41,595
and usually it was his mouth.

329
00:30:41,595 --> 00:30:43,704
- Look if you're hiding something

330
00:30:43,704 --> 00:30:46,121
your life could be in danger.

331
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:50,314
- I don't scare easily cop.

332
00:30:54,155 --> 00:30:56,905
(dramatic music)

333
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:22,560
- That's far enough right there Average

334
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:24,279
and don't get tough.

335
00:31:24,279 --> 00:31:27,201
- What, ruin a good shirt?

336
00:31:27,201 --> 00:31:28,560
- What do you want?

337
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:29,848
- Talk with Walter.

338
00:31:29,848 --> 00:31:30,749
- What about?

339
00:31:30,749 --> 00:31:33,309
- About how I had to push my
way through some smart ass

340
00:31:33,309 --> 00:31:35,869
punks so I could talk with him.

341
00:31:35,869 --> 00:31:38,726
- You know one of these days
we're gonna meet in a dark

342
00:31:38,726 --> 00:31:42,986
alley Average and we'll
see who is the punk.

343
00:31:42,986 --> 00:31:44,037
- What's the matter Billy?

344
00:31:44,037 --> 00:31:46,675
Your ass still sore from the pen?

345
00:31:46,675 --> 00:31:47,592
- Fuck you.

346
00:31:49,317 --> 00:31:50,674
(thudding)
(crying out)

347
00:31:50,674 --> 00:31:53,154
- Nice chatting with you Billy.

348
00:31:53,154 --> 00:31:55,904
(dramatic music)

349
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:12,760
(laughing)

350
00:32:13,841 --> 00:32:15,230
(knocking)

351
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:17,142
- Wait a minute.

352
00:32:17,142 --> 00:32:19,475
I got a dick at my doorstep.

353
00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:21,502
What?

354
00:32:21,502 --> 00:32:23,169
- Hang up the phone.

355
00:32:24,548 --> 00:32:26,715
- I'll call you back Fred.

356
00:32:31,229 --> 00:32:32,189
So talk.

357
00:32:32,189 --> 00:32:34,161
- Blake Johnson.

358
00:32:34,161 --> 00:32:37,172
- Listen if you've come here
to pin anything on my boys

359
00:32:37,172 --> 00:32:39,881
again Average forget it,
Johnson was a sweetheart of

360
00:32:39,881 --> 00:32:42,702
a driver and I'm sorry as
hell the fucker's gone.

361
00:32:42,702 --> 00:32:44,230
- When did he work for you last?

362
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:45,897
- Shit I don't know.

363
00:32:46,852 --> 00:32:49,510
Night before last he
delivered a truckload of kale.

364
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:50,519
- To?

365
00:32:50,519 --> 00:32:52,602
- I'd have to look it up.

366
00:32:54,582 --> 00:32:56,732
Look I got over 20 fuckin' trucks here.

367
00:32:56,732 --> 00:32:58,572
Maybe you'd prefer we
bring in a few good men

368
00:32:58,572 --> 00:33:00,572
and go over your shipping reports.

369
00:33:00,572 --> 00:33:03,239
- Course what was I thinking of?

370
00:33:04,841 --> 00:33:07,341
Tuesday night, Martel produce.

371
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:10,640
- Do you have any idea
where Tonio Mandio is?

372
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,188
- No but don't worry if I do

373
00:33:12,188 --> 00:33:14,332
a cop will be the first thing I call.

374
00:33:14,332 --> 00:33:15,891
- I ran across Billy Reese outside.

375
00:33:15,891 --> 00:33:17,532
When'd you start hanging
out with convicts?

376
00:33:17,532 --> 00:33:20,820
- When you started arresting my employees.

377
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:23,153
I trust you didn't hurt him?

378
00:33:27,972 --> 00:33:30,502
(dramatic music)

379
00:33:30,502 --> 00:33:35,081
Yeah it's me Joe Average
just paid us a visit.

380
00:33:35,081 --> 00:33:36,891
It won't take him long to
put two and two together

381
00:33:36,891 --> 00:33:39,430
and turn Tonio against us.

382
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:41,630
You better you prick.

00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:58,550
Yeah, yeah I know where that is.

00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:38,538
- Hey Tonio, how's it hanging?

391
00:34:38,538 --> 00:34:41,297
- Right where you left it.

392
00:34:41,297 --> 00:34:44,729
- Hey chill homeboy it's time for a drive.

393
00:34:44,729 --> 00:34:47,277

394
00:34:47,277 --> 00:34:51,038
- Hey Tonio we don't need
no guns we just wanna talk.

395
00:34:51,038 --> 00:34:51,871
- Okay.

396
00:34:53,099 --> 00:34:57,335
(thudding)
(crying out)

397
00:34:57,335 --> 00:34:58,752
Come on, come on.

00:34:59,825 --> 00:35:03,992
(thudding)
(crying out)

399
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:33,943
You guys should have brought guns.

400
00:35:34,948 --> 00:35:38,069
Where's Martel and Dunning hiding out?

401
00:35:38,069 --> 00:35:41,199
- King warehouse, waiting for you.

402
00:35:41,199 --> 00:35:43,366
(screams)

403
00:35:45,659 --> 00:35:47,419
You son of a bitch.

404
00:35:47,419 --> 00:35:49,801
You son of a bitch.

405
00:35:49,801 --> 00:35:54,110
You son of a (crying out).

406
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:56,860
- Give this to Martel and Dunning

407
00:35:57,721 --> 00:36:00,841
tell 'em I got the
money and I'm on my way.

408
00:36:00,841 --> 00:36:01,841
- My finger.

409
00:36:03,788 --> 00:36:04,639
- You won't need it.

410
00:36:04,639 --> 00:36:05,472
- No!

411
00:36:05,472 --> 00:36:07,889
(gun firing)

412
00:36:09,069 --> 00:36:11,819
(dramatic music)

413
00:36:22,618 --> 00:36:24,368
- Patch me into 4023.

414
00:36:26,306 --> 00:36:30,156
Joe, Browning get this
Blake made two calls

415
00:36:30,156 --> 00:36:32,756
to Theresa's number yesterday.

416
00:36:32,756 --> 00:36:34,767
- I talked to Walter Dunning.

417
00:36:34,767 --> 00:36:38,436
Blake delivered a load of
kale to Martel's last night.

418
00:36:38,436 --> 00:36:40,914
- Things are getting interesting.

419
00:36:40,914 --> 00:36:42,418
What about Eddie and Billy?

420
00:36:42,418 --> 00:36:43,977
- I know where to find them.

421
00:36:43,977 --> 00:36:45,906
How about lunch?

422
00:36:45,906 --> 00:36:49,989
- Yeah I know where that's
at, I'll see ya in 10.

423
00:36:51,793 --> 00:36:54,543
(dramatic music)

424
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:01,818
And that's not all.

425
00:37:01,818 --> 00:37:02,906
What? What?

426
00:37:02,906 --> 00:37:04,573
- Hm? Nothing go on.

427
00:37:05,517 --> 00:37:08,026
- Blake's got two tickets
to Maui waiting for him

428
00:37:08,026 --> 00:37:11,109
under the name of Mr. and Mrs. Smith.

429
00:37:12,058 --> 00:37:13,308
- How original.

430
00:37:14,218 --> 00:37:17,245
So first she called and left
a message on her machine

431
00:37:17,245 --> 00:37:19,415
and then he called Theresa
back and talked to someone

432
00:37:19,415 --> 00:37:20,535
for almost 10 minutes.

433
00:37:20,535 --> 00:37:22,077
- Could have been the maid.

434
00:37:22,077 --> 00:37:26,105
- Yeah it could have been
Santa Claus but I doubt it.

435
00:37:26,105 --> 00:37:28,431
So Miss Fields did talk to
her husband the night before

436
00:37:28,431 --> 00:37:30,764
he was murdered, about what?

437
00:37:32,882 --> 00:37:34,653
- I don't know?

438
00:37:34,653 --> 00:37:37,481
What do husbands and
wives always talk about?

439
00:37:37,481 --> 00:37:39,272
- Money and restraining orders?

440
00:37:39,272 --> 00:37:41,072
- I'll buy that.

441
00:37:41,072 --> 00:37:42,813
- But why are they still married?

442
00:37:42,813 --> 00:37:44,350
- She's rich and famous.

443
00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:45,740
- She is now.

444
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:46,621
- Meaning?

445
00:37:46,621 --> 00:37:49,351
- Meaning who and what was she before?

446
00:37:49,351 --> 00:37:52,493
- Are you saying maybe
Blake has something on her?

447
00:37:52,493 --> 00:37:53,660
- Had.
- What?

448
00:37:54,521 --> 00:37:57,469
- I don't know but if the
world finds out I bet the

449
00:37:57,469 --> 00:37:59,882
advertisers won't be so
willing to pay Miss Fields

450
00:37:59,882 --> 00:38:01,792
so much money to hock their wares.

451
00:38:01,792 --> 00:38:03,613
- Mrs. Fields, no.

452
00:38:03,613 --> 00:38:06,453
She's as refreshing as a blueberry muffin.

453
00:38:06,453 --> 00:38:07,981
- Trust me.

454
00:38:07,981 --> 00:38:10,531
- Television won't ever seem the same.

455
00:38:10,531 --> 00:38:13,773
- Look do me a favor get a court order

456
00:38:13,773 --> 00:38:15,573
and pull Johnson's banking records.

457
00:38:15,573 --> 00:38:18,533
See who's been paying him
what on a monthly basis.

458
00:38:18,533 --> 00:38:19,842
- You mean alimony?

459
00:38:19,842 --> 00:38:21,392
- Something like that.

460
00:38:21,392 --> 00:38:24,712
If we're right I think Theresa
may wanna cut us a deal

461
00:38:24,712 --> 00:38:28,860
or for whatever Blake had
on her, books, photos.

462
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:32,110
- Oh, do you mind if I finish my lunch?

463
00:38:33,072 --> 00:38:34,322
- By all means.

464
00:38:35,832 --> 00:38:36,950
- You gonna eat that pizza.

465
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:38,819
- Nah take it.

466
00:38:38,819 --> 00:38:41,569
(dramatic music)

467
00:38:59,389 --> 00:39:02,139
(dramatic music)

468
00:39:14,816 --> 00:39:17,083
(intercom beeping)

469
00:39:17,083 --> 00:39:17,995
- [Man] Who is it?

470
00:39:17,995 --> 00:39:19,987
- Joe Average homicide I'd
like to take a look at Blake

471
00:39:19,987 --> 00:39:22,176
Johnson's apartment please?

472
00:39:22,176 --> 00:39:24,067
(mumbles)

473
00:39:24,067 --> 00:39:25,817
- Just buzz the door.

474
00:39:30,435 --> 00:39:33,185
(dramatic music)

475
00:40:50,851 --> 00:40:52,851
- [TV] Today on the channel
four news, she was a typical

476
00:40:52,851 --> 00:40:54,859
teenager who turned into one of Holly--

477
00:40:54,859 --> 00:40:59,026
(cheesy music)
(moaning)

478
00:41:04,516 --> 00:41:07,126
- Actually no the lighting
was a little dark.

479
00:41:07,126 --> 00:41:10,914
- I was only 18 I didn't know any better.

480
00:41:10,914 --> 00:41:13,254
- Just a horny little girl
who had no idea you were ever

481
00:41:13,254 --> 00:41:14,956
gonna be famous.

482
00:41:14,956 --> 00:41:16,065
- Hey fuck you alright?

483
00:41:16,065 --> 00:41:17,732
We needed the money.

484
00:41:19,832 --> 00:41:21,653
Then an agent found me and
I destroyed what I thought

485
00:41:21,653 --> 00:41:22,853
was the only copy.

486
00:41:22,853 --> 00:41:25,963
- Only Blake duped it in case
you got smart and dumped him.

487
00:41:25,963 --> 00:41:28,813
- That's right give it to me.

488
00:41:28,813 --> 00:41:30,424
- Have you got a permit for that?

489
00:41:30,424 --> 00:41:32,363
- What, I walked into my
murdered husband's apartment,

490
00:41:32,363 --> 00:41:33,693
I found an intruder how was I supposed

491
00:41:33,693 --> 00:41:34,872
to know you were a cop?

492
00:41:34,872 --> 00:41:35,760
- Better think it over.

493
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,853
- I have thought it over for 10 years.

494
00:41:37,853 --> 00:41:38,944
Now give me the tape.

495
00:41:38,944 --> 00:41:40,784
- We know you've been paying
Blake money every month.

496
00:41:40,784 --> 00:41:41,617
- So?

497
00:41:41,617 --> 00:41:44,024
- We also know he called you
twice the night before he died.

498
00:41:44,024 --> 00:41:45,662
- Big deal, I forgot.

499
00:41:45,662 --> 00:41:49,283
- Look I'll destroy this tape
right here if you tell me

500
00:41:49,283 --> 00:41:51,116
what you talked about.

501
00:41:53,493 --> 00:41:56,576
- Look I had nothing to do with this.

502
00:41:59,711 --> 00:42:02,990
He said he was ripping him
off for a million dollars.

503
00:42:02,990 --> 00:42:04,224
- Well whose money was it?

504
00:42:04,224 --> 00:42:05,141
- Walter's.

505
00:42:07,104 --> 00:42:10,312
Blake was running coke across
the border in Walter's trucks

506
00:42:10,312 --> 00:42:13,812
and he was delivering it to a Paris Martel

507
00:42:14,824 --> 00:42:16,870
and Blake would then deliver
the money back to Walter,

508
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:19,533
that's all he told me I...

509
00:42:19,533 --> 00:42:21,640
- What about Anna Martel?

510
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:24,473
- I don't know maybe he loved her.

511
00:42:26,123 --> 00:42:28,761
He always had a thing
for those young girls.

512
00:42:28,761 --> 00:42:32,070
- So he called you last night
to let you off the hook.

513
00:42:32,070 --> 00:42:32,903
- Yeah.

514
00:42:35,849 --> 00:42:39,432
And Blake was always
braggin', Mr. Bigshot.

515
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:44,550
- Why didn't you just come right
over here and get the tape?

516
00:42:44,550 --> 00:42:46,809
- Somebody's been following me.

517
00:42:46,809 --> 00:42:47,642
- Who?

518
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:52,081
- Me, on your knees cop.

519
00:42:52,081 --> 00:42:53,068
- Don't try anything stupid.

520
00:42:53,068 --> 00:42:54,799
- It's to late for that.

521
00:42:54,799 --> 00:42:58,049
I'm already a dead man and
I'm taking everybody with me.

522
00:42:58,049 --> 00:43:01,145
Stop looking for me or
she goes first got it?

523
00:43:01,145 --> 00:43:02,558
- I got it.

524
00:43:02,558 --> 00:43:05,558
- Joe (crying out).

525
00:43:08,948 --> 00:43:11,497
- Hey what about the rent?

526
00:43:11,497 --> 00:43:14,164
- I've got your rent right here.

527
00:43:17,767 --> 00:43:20,388
(gun firing)

528
00:43:20,388 --> 00:43:22,057
(laughing)
(whimpering)

529
00:43:22,057 --> 00:43:24,807
(dramatic music)

530
00:43:40,085 --> 00:43:40,918
- Shit.

531
00:44:02,974 --> 00:44:03,807
Shit.

532
00:44:14,406 --> 00:44:18,573
- Hey look if it ain't

00:44:20,004 --> 00:44:23,716
What's the matter ocifer

534
00:44:23,716 --> 00:44:25,908
(laughing)

535
00:44:25,908 --> 00:44:27,446
- You punks having a good time?

536
00:44:27,446 --> 00:44:31,266
- Oh we're just out taking a
stroll looking for new digs

537
00:44:31,266 --> 00:44:32,966
and a little action.

538
00:44:32,966 --> 00:44:34,907
- Yeah now that we're outta the joint,

539
00:44:34,907 --> 00:44:36,718
no thanks to you.

540
00:44:36,718 --> 00:44:39,057
- So here we are in a
lonesome alley after all.

541
00:44:39,057 --> 00:44:41,086
- Yeah just me and you--

542
00:44:41,086 --> 00:44:42,376
- And monkey face.

543
00:44:42,376 --> 00:44:45,297
- Hey I just come by to give you a hand.

544
00:44:45,297 --> 00:44:47,657
- Yeah a couple of 'em.

545
00:44:47,657 --> 00:44:51,274
(thudding)
(crying out)

546
00:44:51,274 --> 00:44:52,386
- Come here, come here.

547
00:44:52,386 --> 00:44:56,553
(thudding)
(crying out)

548
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:10,283
Oh he's gonna change
my fuckin' tire eh now?

549
00:45:10,283 --> 00:45:12,193
- I ain't changin' your fuckin' tire.

550
00:45:12,193 --> 00:45:13,062
- Oh yeah?

551
00:45:13,062 --> 00:45:15,062
(thudding)
(crying out)

552
00:45:15,062 --> 00:45:16,229
How about you?

553
00:45:18,833 --> 00:45:20,411
Come on.

554
00:45:20,411 --> 00:45:21,744
Change the tire.

555
00:45:27,712 --> 00:45:30,462
(engine running)

556
00:45:37,451 --> 00:45:38,582
- Why didn't you fucking shoot?

557
00:45:38,582 --> 00:45:39,961
- He may not be alone.

558
00:45:39,961 --> 00:45:40,794
- Oh Jesus.

559
00:45:40,794 --> 00:45:41,902
- Come on finish up.

560
00:45:41,902 --> 00:45:43,173
- Fuck you asshole.

561
00:45:43,173 --> 00:45:45,423
(thudding)

562
00:45:47,444 --> 00:45:48,277
- Ah shit.

563
00:45:50,701 --> 00:45:52,118
- What about him?

564
00:45:53,102 --> 00:45:54,244
- Let him go.

565
00:45:54,244 --> 00:45:57,577
- Hey, hey man my life's in danger here.

566
00:45:58,953 --> 00:46:01,036
Hey you gotta take me in.

567
00:46:03,884 --> 00:46:04,717
Okay?

568
00:46:05,732 --> 00:46:07,701
I'll tell you anything you want to know.

569
00:46:07,701 --> 00:46:09,222
- He tried to kill you Joe.

570
00:46:09,222 --> 00:46:13,442
- I'm not wasting the public's
money on this punk again.

571
00:46:13,442 --> 00:46:14,775
- Get the cuffs.

572
00:46:17,454 --> 00:46:21,193
- Okay I know where Martel
and Dunning are hiding out

573
00:46:21,193 --> 00:46:23,884
they're waiting for Tonio.

574
00:46:23,884 --> 00:46:25,054
- Where?

575
00:46:25,054 --> 00:46:26,971
- No I want protection.

576
00:46:33,033 --> 00:46:33,974
- Okay.

577
00:46:33,974 --> 00:46:35,552
- Thank you.

578
00:46:35,552 --> 00:46:39,052
King's warehouse off Figaroa and the five.

579
00:46:40,153 --> 00:46:42,254
- Thank you, now hit the road.

580
00:46:42,254 --> 00:46:44,334
- Hey arrest me mother fucker.

581
00:46:44,334 --> 00:46:45,182
- Joe you can't do this.

582
00:46:45,182 --> 00:46:47,022
- I'm an endangered species man.

583
00:46:47,022 --> 00:46:48,822
Hey you can't let him
put me out on the street

584
00:46:48,822 --> 00:46:50,405
without protection.

585
00:46:52,364 --> 00:46:54,122
Are you fuckin' nuts?

586
00:46:54,122 --> 00:46:56,953
- Always wear your raincoat now beat it.

587
00:46:56,953 --> 00:46:59,703
(dramatic music)

588
00:47:04,366 --> 00:47:05,376
- Where the fuck did he go?

589
00:47:05,376 --> 00:47:06,826
What the hell did you do that for?

590
00:47:06,826 --> 00:47:08,909
- B, come on get in here.

591
00:47:13,098 --> 00:47:16,216
- So if Tonio's got the money
why doesn't he just run?

592
00:47:16,216 --> 00:47:17,967
- I don't think he wants to live.

593
00:47:17,967 --> 00:47:19,599
- Then why grab Theresa?

594
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:23,628
- Buying time from us, getting
even with Blake I don't know.

595
00:47:23,628 --> 00:47:25,565
- You think he's gonna kill her?

596
00:47:25,565 --> 00:47:27,565
- What's he got to lose?

597
00:47:29,959 --> 00:47:31,767
- What'd you find up at Blake's?

598
00:47:31,767 --> 00:47:32,600
- Nothin'.

599
00:47:33,698 --> 00:47:37,527
- Nothin', so you destroyed
whatever it wasn't.

600
00:47:37,527 --> 00:47:40,359
- I don't know what you're talking about.

601
00:47:40,359 --> 00:47:41,868
- That good huh?

602
00:47:41,868 --> 00:47:45,239
- Good enough to explain
the restraining order.

603
00:47:45,239 --> 00:47:46,322
- Just drive.

604
00:48:00,644 --> 00:48:02,674
- I don't like this.

605
00:48:02,674 --> 00:48:03,625
Where are those guys?

606
00:48:03,625 --> 00:48:04,458
- Shut up!

607
00:48:06,505 --> 00:48:09,422
God your whining's driving me nuts.

608
00:48:10,294 --> 00:48:12,502
- Listen if your daughter
wasn't such a slut

609
00:48:12,502 --> 00:48:13,894
we wouldn't be in this mess to begin--

610
00:48:13,894 --> 00:48:16,785
(thudding)
(crying out)

611
00:48:16,785 --> 00:48:18,535
- Someone's up there.

612
00:48:23,484 --> 00:48:25,484
- Give him back his gun.

613
00:48:30,894 --> 00:48:32,665
- Hello ladies.

614
00:48:32,665 --> 00:48:34,084
- Shit Tonio.

615
00:48:34,084 --> 00:48:35,784
Hey man I'm unarmed.

616
00:48:35,784 --> 00:48:37,117
- Keep climbing.

617
00:48:47,781 --> 00:48:51,698
- Hey thanks Tonio, hey
for a minute there man.

618
00:48:52,970 --> 00:48:54,682
I thought you'd waste me.

619
00:48:54,682 --> 00:48:55,515
- I am

620
00:49:02,671 --> 00:49:06,838
(gun firing)
(crying out)

621
00:49:10,533 --> 00:49:12,354
(banging)

622
00:49:12,354 --> 00:49:14,604
- Open up, come on it's me!

623
00:49:15,466 --> 00:49:16,974
- We gotta let him in.

624
00:49:16,974 --> 00:49:17,891
- Oh Jesus!

625
00:49:18,736 --> 00:49:21,736
- If you open that door the
next scream will be yours.

626
00:49:21,736 --> 00:49:23,654
Anybody see Tonio?

627
00:49:23,654 --> 00:49:24,487
- Nothin'.

628
00:49:25,845 --> 00:49:26,936
(gun firing)

629
00:49:26,936 --> 00:49:30,019
- Shit.
(crying out)

630
00:49:36,634 --> 00:49:37,838
(gun firing)
(crying out)

631
00:49:37,838 --> 00:49:38,671
God damn.

632
00:49:41,377 --> 00:49:42,978
(gun firing)

633
00:49:42,978 --> 00:49:43,811
- No!

634
00:49:45,378 --> 00:49:47,629
- Unless you're ordering
a pizza Bob don't.

635
00:49:47,629 --> 00:49:49,718
- We've gotta call in for backup Joe.

636
00:49:49,718 --> 00:49:51,167
- I wanna go in quietly.

637
00:49:51,167 --> 00:49:52,349
- Are you crazy?

638
00:49:52,349 --> 00:49:54,869
You can't go in by yourself.

639
00:49:54,869 --> 00:49:56,439
- I'm not.

640
00:49:56,439 --> 00:50:00,978
- Whoa wait a minute, I'm a
desk man these days remember?

641
00:50:00,978 --> 00:50:03,907
- You're here and I need your help.

642
00:50:03,907 --> 00:50:05,867
- I don't have a gun.

643
00:50:05,867 --> 00:50:08,199
- There's one in the glove box.

644
00:50:08,199 --> 00:50:09,366
- I can't Joe.

645
00:50:12,424 --> 00:50:13,257
- He had a gun on you Bob.

646
00:50:13,257 --> 00:50:15,569
- He was just a kid.

647
00:50:15,569 --> 00:50:17,817
- It was either you or him
and you made your decision

648
00:50:17,817 --> 00:50:19,889
now live with it.

649
00:50:19,889 --> 00:50:23,889
- I have, I do the leg
work, I push the pencils.

650
00:50:26,390 --> 00:50:28,700
- If we call in backup the
captain's gonna call Mitch

651
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:30,670
and Skeeze, Theresa won't stand a chance.

652
00:50:30,670 --> 00:50:32,517
Tonio doesn't know we're
coming and that's the way

653
00:50:32,517 --> 00:50:33,510
we gotta play it.

654
00:50:33,510 --> 00:50:37,677
- God damn me for having a
partner with suicidal tendencies.

655
00:50:38,758 --> 00:50:41,478
- You damned yourself now live with it.

656
00:50:41,478 --> 00:50:46,070
- Fuck you, stop the God
damn car, let me outta here.

657
00:50:46,070 --> 00:50:46,903
- Get out.

658
00:50:49,769 --> 00:50:52,889
- Why do you always have to
be a prick about everything?

659
00:50:52,889 --> 00:50:54,590
- It's the bright part of my personality.

660
00:50:54,590 --> 00:50:55,757
Shut the door.

661
00:50:57,380 --> 00:50:59,713
(muttering)

662
00:51:01,449 --> 00:51:03,059
Take the gun.

663
00:51:03,059 --> 00:51:07,226
- No and I'm calling backup
just as soon as we get there.

664
00:51:08,340 --> 00:51:10,769
- Well I'm goin' in.

665
00:51:10,769 --> 00:51:12,950
If you get a shot at Tonio take him down.

666
00:51:12,950 --> 00:51:14,270
- Maybe we should wait for backup.

667
00:51:14,270 --> 00:51:16,837
- Theresa could be dead by then.

668
00:51:16,837 --> 00:51:19,170
- It's been a long time Joe.

669
00:51:20,918 --> 00:51:24,001
- Bob, just aim and pull the trigger.

670
00:51:37,238 --> 00:51:39,387
- He just tossed out the briefcase.

671
00:51:39,387 --> 00:51:42,255
(rattling)

672
00:51:42,255 --> 00:51:44,185
- Is a million worth dying for?

673
00:51:44,185 --> 00:51:47,577
- I just want my money
and the fuck outta here.

674
00:51:47,577 --> 00:51:49,744
- Why would he let you go?

675
00:51:53,785 --> 00:51:56,675
- I don't have anything to
do with this shit Tonio.

676
00:51:56,675 --> 00:51:58,393
You know that.

677
00:51:58,393 --> 00:52:00,604
I just want my fuckin' money.

678
00:52:00,604 --> 00:52:01,617
I'm comin' out.

679
00:52:01,617 --> 00:52:03,149
(rattling)

680
00:52:03,149 --> 00:52:04,149
There it is.

681
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:23,880
I'm in, I'm vader I fucking made it.

682
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:30,687
One cool fuckin' million come
to papa my little million.

683
00:52:38,209 --> 00:52:39,042
Jesus.

684
00:52:40,279 --> 00:52:42,196
- Does anybody see him?

685
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:45,422
- Check it out.

686
00:52:45,422 --> 00:52:48,089
(ominous music)

687
00:52:50,849 --> 00:52:54,099
- Jack, do you see anything over there?

688
00:52:55,796 --> 00:52:56,798
Jack?

689
00:52:56,798 --> 00:52:59,465
(ominous music)

690
00:57:23,077 --> 00:57:24,178
- I see you Tonio.

691
00:57:24,178 --> 00:57:25,530
- I saw you first.

692
00:57:25,530 --> 00:57:28,197
(ominous music)

693
00:57:58,374 --> 00:57:59,493
Hello boss.

694
00:57:59,493 --> 00:58:03,660
(thudding)
(crying out)

695
00:58:06,820 --> 00:58:08,494
I'm a bandit you know.

696
00:58:08,494 --> 00:58:10,342
- You better kill me
while you can you bastard.

697
00:58:10,342 --> 00:58:11,175
- Oh no.

698
00:58:33,556 --> 00:58:34,556
- Oh my God.

699
00:58:35,575 --> 00:58:36,824
It's Jack.

700
00:58:36,824 --> 00:58:39,226
The mother fucker cut his throat.

701
00:58:39,226 --> 00:58:41,643
(whimpering)

702
00:59:04,118 --> 00:59:04,951
(ominous music)

703
00:59:04,951 --> 00:59:06,784
- Rock and roll Tonio.

704
00:59:15,766 --> 00:59:17,057
(crying out)

705
00:59:17,057 --> 00:59:18,890
- Bob for apples babe.

706
00:59:19,846 --> 00:59:22,513
(ominous music)

707
00:59:32,217 --> 00:59:33,600
(banging)

708
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:36,017
(crying out)

709
00:59:41,423 --> 00:59:43,090
- It's me come here.

710
00:59:49,376 --> 00:59:50,412
- Give me your gun I'm
gonna kill this prick.

711
00:59:50,412 --> 00:59:51,641
- I don't have one.

712
00:59:51,641 --> 00:59:53,892
- What you're gonna save me
but you didn't bring a gun?

713
00:59:53,892 --> 00:59:54,863
- Shh.

714
00:59:54,863 --> 00:59:57,530
(ominous music)

715
01:01:05,165 --> 01:01:05,998
(crying out)

716
01:01:05,998 --> 01:01:06,831
- Tonio.

717
01:01:06,831 --> 01:01:08,674
It's me Steve.

718
01:01:08,674 --> 01:01:12,336
Yeah I know we messed you
up at the warehouse but

719
01:01:12,336 --> 01:01:14,845
you killed the boss's daughter.

720
01:01:14,845 --> 01:01:17,386
Hey I got a wife and a kid.

721
01:01:17,386 --> 01:01:19,803
(crying out)

722
01:01:20,805 --> 01:01:22,696
You psycho fuck.

723
01:01:22,696 --> 01:01:24,354
(crying out)

724
01:01:24,354 --> 01:01:27,021
(ominous music)

725
01:01:59,503 --> 01:02:02,170
- All I wanted was my life back.

726
01:02:05,455 --> 01:02:07,727
- Please don't kill me Tonio.

727
01:02:07,727 --> 01:02:10,167
- Don't worry Rick I'm
saving you for later.

728
01:02:10,167 --> 01:02:12,834
(ominous music)

729
01:02:23,241 --> 01:02:25,658
(crying out)

730
01:02:28,137 --> 01:02:30,387
Don't say I didn't warn ya.

731
01:02:38,733 --> 01:02:42,900
(thudding)
(crying out)

732
01:02:55,969 --> 01:02:56,802
- Okay.

733
01:03:00,588 --> 01:03:04,755
(thudding)
(crying out)

734
01:03:13,156 --> 01:03:15,125
- I forgive you Tonio.

735
01:03:15,125 --> 01:03:17,792
(ominous music)

736
01:03:43,024 --> 01:03:45,441
- If life could be that easy.

737
01:03:46,315 --> 01:03:47,525
- Hey butt head!

738
01:03:47,525 --> 01:03:50,192
(ominous music)

739
01:03:59,524 --> 01:04:00,593
- Thanks.

740
01:04:00,593 --> 01:04:01,713
- I'll take her home.

741
01:04:01,713 --> 01:04:03,796
- Just get me outta here.

742
01:04:05,931 --> 01:04:07,233
- Rick!

743
01:04:07,233 --> 01:04:09,212
Answer me boy.

744
01:04:09,212 --> 01:04:10,212
- He's dead.

745
01:04:12,540 --> 01:04:14,481
It's over Paris.

746
01:04:14,481 --> 01:04:18,314
Put down your gun put
your hands on your head.

747
01:04:21,861 --> 01:04:23,492
(gun firing)

748
01:04:23,492 --> 01:04:26,159
(ominous music)

749
01:04:44,378 --> 01:04:45,280
- Hey Joe.

750
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:47,530
- Hey Browning how'd it go?

751
01:04:48,920 --> 01:04:50,899
- Oh they didn't find a thing.

752
01:04:50,899 --> 01:04:52,177
- No money, no coke?

753
01:04:52,177 --> 01:04:53,010
- Nada.

754
01:04:53,897 --> 01:04:55,199
So where are you off to?

755
01:04:55,199 --> 01:04:57,350
- A certain gorgeous
pigeon gave me a call.

756
01:04:57,350 --> 01:04:58,491
- Well you better be careful.

757
01:04:58,491 --> 01:04:59,571
- Yeah don't worry.

758
01:04:59,571 --> 01:05:00,404
(laughs)

759
01:05:00,404 --> 01:05:01,489
- Oh by the way I can't
make the game tonight.

760
01:05:01,489 --> 01:05:02,322
- Oh come on.

761
01:05:02,322 --> 01:05:06,051
- I'm sorry Joe no can do, my
kids would like to know who

762
01:05:06,051 --> 01:05:07,670
their father is.

763
01:05:07,670 --> 01:05:08,503
- Okay.

764
01:05:25,842 --> 01:05:28,425
(gentle music)

765
01:05:36,460 --> 01:05:37,293
- Hi.

766
01:05:37,293 --> 01:05:38,791
- Hi.

767
01:05:38,791 --> 01:05:39,772
- Thanks for comin'.

768
01:05:39,772 --> 01:05:40,855
- No problem.

769
01:05:42,260 --> 01:05:47,231
- I just um, I wanted to
well yesterday I just didn't

770
01:05:47,231 --> 01:05:50,400
get the chance to say thank you.

771
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:52,733
- It's just part of the job.

772
01:05:54,428 --> 01:05:57,292
- And I wanted to apologize
for the way I spoke to you

773
01:05:57,292 --> 01:05:59,459
and to give you something.

774
01:06:00,380 --> 01:06:01,213
- What?

775
01:06:02,652 --> 01:06:03,820
- This.

776
01:06:03,820 --> 01:06:06,570
(romantic music)

777
01:06:20,373 --> 01:06:23,540
(light hearted music)

778
01:06:32,315 --> 01:06:33,732
- We're rich yay!

779
01:06:35,929 --> 01:06:36,762
Whee!

780
01:06:45,907 --> 01:06:47,358
Come on let's go.

781
01:06:47,358 --> 01:06:49,941
(gentle music)

782
01:08:21,393 --> 01:08:23,193
- Joe Average.

783
01:08:23,193 --> 01:08:24,526
Morning captain.

784
01:08:25,684 --> 01:08:26,517
When?

785
01:08:27,833 --> 01:08:29,500
Browning on his way?

786
01:08:31,442 --> 01:08:34,359
Still beating your employees Paris?

787
01:08:38,844 --> 01:08:43,011
(thudding)
(crying out)

788
01:08:45,863 --> 01:08:48,433
There's another one waiting
for you when you get back,

789
01:08:48,433 --> 01:08:50,016
one of my snitches.

790
01:08:50,884 --> 01:08:52,703
(thudding)
(crying out)

791
01:08:52,703 --> 01:08:55,120
Nice chatting with you Billy.

792
01:09:16,671 --> 01:09:18,743
- I'll run ballistics and
see if I can match these up

793
01:09:18,743 --> 01:09:20,033
with the two this morning.

794
01:09:20,033 --> 01:09:20,866
Mrs. Fields?

795
01:09:20,866 --> 01:09:24,541
No, she's as refreshing
as a blueberry muffin.

796
01:09:24,541 --> 01:09:28,192
Trust me, television
won't ever seem the same.

797
01:09:28,192 --> 01:09:29,801
- Oh don't worry.

798
01:09:29,801 --> 01:09:31,313
- Oh by the way I can't
make the game tonight.

799
01:09:31,313 --> 01:09:32,146
- Oh come on.

800
01:09:32,146 --> 01:09:34,979
- I'm sorry Joe no can do my kids.

801
01:09:36,491 --> 01:09:38,961
Johnson slapped a restraining order on her

802
01:09:38,961 --> 01:09:41,201
just to keep her away from his place.

803
01:09:41,201 --> 01:09:42,641
- Now that's a twist.

804
01:09:42,641 --> 01:09:45,141
- Thought you might like that.

805
01:09:45,141 --> 01:09:49,361
Oh and I'll let you break
the news to Paris Martel.

806
01:09:49,361 --> 01:09:52,231
- Thank you ever so much.

807
01:09:52,231 --> 01:09:54,231
- Anna I didn't mean to.

808
01:09:55,753 --> 01:09:56,586
Anna.

809
01:09:57,612 --> 01:09:59,445
Anna I didn't mean to.

810
01:10:11,023 --> 01:10:13,103
Don't make me a cop killer.

811
01:10:13,103 --> 01:10:15,391
- Why did he have a
restraining order on you?

812
01:10:15,391 --> 01:10:17,212
- Because there was a
time in our relationship

813
01:10:17,212 --> 01:10:18,359
when I woulda killed him myself.

814
01:10:18,359 --> 01:10:19,639
A son of bitch and a loser

815
01:10:19,639 --> 01:10:20,472
and if you don't mind I'd really--

816
01:10:20,472 --> 01:10:22,450
- He was about to run
off with another woman.

817
01:10:22,450 --> 01:10:23,959
- He was always runnin' off with something

818
01:10:23,959 --> 01:10:25,639
and usually it was his mouth.

819
01:10:25,639 --> 01:10:28,722
Fuck you alright we needed the money.

820
01:10:30,381 --> 01:10:32,067
An agent found me and I
destroyed what I thought

821
01:10:32,067 --> 01:10:33,567
was the only copy.

822
01:10:43,770 --> 01:10:44,719
- Give him back his gun.

823
01:10:44,719 --> 01:10:46,528
- Being partners.

824
01:10:46,528 --> 01:10:50,329
Being a husband something
that you know nothing about.

825
01:10:50,329 --> 01:10:52,329
- Well no one's perfect.

826
01:10:53,999 --> 01:10:56,090
- That you do know about.

827
01:10:56,090 --> 01:10:59,479
Rat's ass maybe you should
go back to your partner.

828
01:10:59,479 --> 01:11:03,396
Better yet maybe you
should go back to the bar.

829
01:11:05,749 --> 01:11:08,949
- And one of these days we're
gonna meet in a dark alley

830
01:11:08,949 --> 01:11:11,976
Average and we'll see who is the punk.

831
01:11:11,976 --> 01:11:15,469
- We were just out taking a
stroll looking for new digs

832
01:11:15,469 --> 01:11:17,136
and a little action.

833
01:11:22,718 --> 01:11:27,359
- Yeah it's me Joe Average
just paid us a visit.

834
01:11:27,359 --> 01:11:29,330
Won't take him long to
put two and two together

835
01:11:29,330 --> 01:11:31,821
and turn Tonio against us.

836
01:11:31,821 --> 01:11:33,571
You better you prick.

837
01:11:36,341 --> 01:11:39,500
I didn't have anything to
do with this shit Tonio.

838
01:11:39,500 --> 01:11:43,210
You know that, I just
want my fucking money.

839
01:11:43,210 --> 01:11:44,309
I'm coming out.

840
01:11:44,309 --> 01:11:46,559
(rattling)

841
01:11:55,667 --> 01:11:58,084
I made it, I fucking made it.

842
01:12:01,359 --> 01:12:05,526
One cool fucking million come
to papa my little million.

843
01:12:14,589 --> 01:12:16,989
- Hey thanks Tonio.

844
01:12:16,989 --> 01:12:21,409
Hey for a minute there man
I thought you'd waste me.

845
01:12:21,409 --> 01:12:24,576
Hey, hey man my life's in danger here.

846
01:12:25,938 --> 01:12:27,635
Hey you gotta take me in.

847
01:12:27,635 --> 01:12:28,718
Why didn't you fucking shoot?

848
01:12:28,718 --> 01:12:30,237
- He may not be alone.

849
01:12:30,237 --> 01:12:31,070
- Oh geez.

850
01:12:31,070 --> 01:12:31,946
- Come on finish up.

851
01:12:31,946 --> 01:12:34,128
- Fuck you asshole.

852
01:12:34,128 --> 01:12:35,306
- Mess you up at the warehouse.

853
01:12:35,306 --> 01:12:38,223
But you killed the boss's daughter.

854
01:12:39,778 --> 01:12:41,968
Hey I got a wife and a kid.

855
01:12:41,968 --> 01:12:44,635
(ominous music)

856
01:12:56,098 --> 01:12:56,931
- What?

857
01:12:58,387 --> 01:12:59,220
- This.

858
01:13:08,138 --> 01:13:10,805
(gentle music)
