Unbelievable.

00:02:59,167 --> 00:03:02,800
What the hell are
you doing here?

7
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:03,900
How you doing, man?

8
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,933
It's been a long time?

9
00:03:05,033 --> 00:03:05,833
It's great to see you.

10
00:03:05,933 --> 00:03:07,000
When did you get out?

11
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,633
- I got paroled early.
- Early?

12
00:03:08,733 --> 00:03:09,567
I'll say early.

13
00:03:09,667 --> 00:03:10,667
Two years early.

14
00:03:10,767 --> 00:03:13,033
Why didn't you tell me
last time you wrote?

15
00:03:13,133 --> 00:03:15,200
Oh, I'm sorry I didn't
write you very much.

16
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,200
It's just, you know, I'm
not the writing kind.

17
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,467
You're not pissed, are you?
- Nah.

18
00:03:18,567 --> 00:03:19,567
Hell.

19
00:03:19,667 --> 00:03:20,700
I got more from you
than I did from Mary.

20
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,800
Oh yeah.
Mary.

21
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:24,700
Yeah, I know.

22
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,700
Things change.

23
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,367
Yeah.
I should say.

24
00:03:27,467 --> 00:03:30,333
I hear she's with some football
jock at the university.

25
00:03:30,433 --> 00:03:32,000
College, huh.

26
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,967
You know it's been two years.

00:03:34,067 --> 00:03:36,033
Don't remind me.

28
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:37,467
You need a place to stay?

29
00:03:37,567 --> 00:03:39,000
No.
I'm staying at my brother's.

30
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,833
It's part of the parole
deal his old lady got me.

31
00:03:40,933 --> 00:03:41,833
No shit.

00:03:41,933 --> 00:03:42,733
That's how you got out early.

33
00:03:42,833 --> 00:03:44,300
She fixed it up for you?

That's right.
That's right.

35
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,567
Her brother-in-law's a judge
down Thornton or something,

ain't he?
God.

37
00:03:48,933 --> 00:03:50,367
Your brother, he
really scored with her.

38
00:03:50,467 --> 00:03:51,467
I mean she's a real looker.

39
00:03:51,567 --> 00:03:52,300
Yeah.

Now, that's more like it.

Actually, you know,
it's smooth, but it's

60
00:04:41,733 --> 00:04:43,433
just running a little rich.

61
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:46,300
But I prefer it
that way, you know.

62
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,967
I'll tell you that sooner
or later I'm sure I'll

63

Well, look.

And-- yeah.

00:05:15,067 --> 00:05:16,200
Yeah, right.
Sure.

It's nothing, man.

I know you didn't have
to take the rap for me.

out easy, and that's that.

There's nothing
that goes on here

future reference if need be.

I think you're
stepping on my toes.

00:06:37,267 --> 00:06:38,700
I mean, after all,
best way to deal

125

00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:33,467
Sometimes, he's a little naive.

368
00:21:33,567 --> 00:21:35,300
My father used to
call it stupid,

369
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:39,167
but I always thought that
was taking it a bit too far.

370
00:21:39,267 --> 00:21:42,300
Of course, Daddy always
takes everything too far.

371
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,700
Why else do you think he
bought us this great big house

372
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,333
for a wedding present?

373
00:21:47,433 --> 00:21:48,933
Your brother thinks
it's generosity.

374
00:21:49,033 --> 00:21:50,967
But I know better.

375
00:21:51,067 --> 00:21:53,900
It's just an extension
of Daddy's ego.

376
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,233
Maybe you two
should give it back.

377
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,233
Then, where would you stay?

378
00:22:03,967 --> 00:22:05,267
Look.

379
00:22:05,367 --> 00:22:07,133
I didn't ask for any favors.

380
00:22:07,233 --> 00:22:09,400
DIANA: Don't take
it so personally.

381
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:13,400
We're all just looking for the
same thing, a little freedom.

382
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,667
A little spontaneity.

383
00:22:20,767 --> 00:22:23,067
A little gratification.

384
00:22:23,167 --> 00:22:24,200
A little excitement.

385
00:22:27,967 --> 00:22:29,500
How about a little respect?

386
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:34,033
[laugh] Respect?

387
00:22:34,133 --> 00:22:35,933
That's classic.

388
00:22:36,033 --> 00:22:37,233
Respect!

389
00:22:37,333 --> 00:22:39,733
I quit looking for
that years ago.

390
00:22:39,833 --> 00:22:41,867
It can't be found, honey.

391
00:22:41,967 --> 00:22:43,100
Not in this town.

392
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,667
Not in my family.

393
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:23,100
PAUL: Jessie, come here.

394
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:31,200
What are you doing here?

395
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:32,733
I told you to stay home.

396
00:23:32,833 --> 00:23:35,000
What's one more day?

397
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:36,833
Hey, you and Diana didn't
get in a fight, did you?

398
00:23:36,933 --> 00:23:38,867
I mean, you got to
watch yourself with her.

399
00:23:38,967 --> 00:23:40,100
She gets a little
pushy, but you can't

400
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,633
let her get on your nerves.

401
00:23:41,733 --> 00:23:42,767
Yeah, well.

402
00:23:42,867 --> 00:23:43,900
Look.

403
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,133
I'm uh-- I'm not
used to apologizing,

404
00:23:47,233 --> 00:23:51,933
but, um, I'm sorry
about last night.

405
00:23:52,033 --> 00:23:53,500
Hey, nothing to it.

406
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,433
The past is the past.

407
00:23:55,533 --> 00:23:58,267
What we've got to do right now
is worry about your future.

408
00:23:58,367 --> 00:24:01,700
I got 600 pounds of ready
mix over at Dalton's Supply

409
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,100
Warehouse.

410
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,267
Why don't you go over there
and give them that check

411
00:24:05,367 --> 00:24:07,400
so they'll deliver it?

412
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:08,300
Take your time.

413
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,133
OK.

414
00:24:09,233 --> 00:24:10,500
Just get there before closing.

415
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,400
Before closing, huh?

416
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,333
Yeah.

417
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:22,800
[music playing]

418
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:27,700
What do you
think you're doing?

419
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,267
You are just too wild.

420
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:33,700
It's freezing.

421
00:25:40,433 --> 00:25:41,333
Nah.
Nah.

422
00:25:41,433 --> 00:25:42,267
Nah.

423
00:25:51,833 --> 00:25:52,667
Don't do it.

424
00:26:03,167 --> 00:26:04,633
I never know what
to do about my hair.

425
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:09,633
I don't want to go to work.

426
00:26:14,833 --> 00:26:15,967
I swear.

427
00:26:16,067 --> 00:26:17,067
What?

428
00:26:17,167 --> 00:26:18,167
Just because
you're Miss Wild--

429
00:26:18,267 --> 00:26:19,133
(MOCKING) I want to come.

430
00:26:19,233 --> 00:26:21,667
I don't want to go to work.

431
00:26:21,767 --> 00:26:23,067
I'll be right back.

432
00:26:28,167 --> 00:26:30,067
Been enjoying the view for long?

433
00:26:34,033 --> 00:26:34,867
Long enough.

434
00:26:34,967 --> 00:26:36,133
Listen, Jessie.

435
00:26:36,233 --> 00:26:38,333
I really don't have
anything to say to you.

436
00:26:38,433 --> 00:26:41,867
Except for maybe I'm
sorry about last night.

437
00:26:41,967 --> 00:26:43,933
Last night.

438
00:26:44,033 --> 00:26:45,233
Forget about last night.

439
00:26:45,333 --> 00:26:47,367
What about every night
for the last two years?

440
00:26:47,467 --> 00:26:49,100
You could have at least
sent me a postcard.

441
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,967
A postcard?

442
00:26:52,067 --> 00:26:54,200
What are you talking about?

443
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:56,833
You know, it took
me a long time.

444
00:26:56,933 --> 00:26:58,533
It took me months,
but I got over it.

445
00:26:58,633 --> 00:26:59,300
What?

446
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,733
You were too busy to call?

447
00:27:00,833 --> 00:27:02,733
It wasn't a cool thing to do.

448
00:27:02,833 --> 00:27:04,167
I wrote you.

449
00:27:04,267 --> 00:27:06,500
I wrote you every day for
over two months straight.

450
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,367
And you did not even
let me know you existed.

451
00:27:08,467 --> 00:27:09,567
What are you talking about?

452
00:27:09,667 --> 00:27:10,667
I sent you letters, cards.

453
00:27:10,767 --> 00:27:12,200
I must have called your
house a dozen times.

454
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:14,233
Your old man said you
didn't want to talk to me.

455
00:27:14,333 --> 00:27:15,900
Don't.

456
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,033
Don't fill me with
your lies any more.

457
00:27:18,133 --> 00:27:19,233
I cannot take it again.

458
00:27:23,133 --> 00:27:24,600
SARAH: Mary, we got to go.

459
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:26,200
We're going to be late for work.

460
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:27,567
Wait.
Don't go.

461
00:27:27,667 --> 00:27:28,333
Come on.

462
00:27:28,433 --> 00:27:30,200
I'll give you a ride back.

463
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:31,300
Come on.

464
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:34,600
I got my bike right over there.

465
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:35,533
Come on.

466
00:27:35,633 --> 00:27:38,833
What do you say?

467
00:27:38,933 --> 00:27:40,133
Tell Mel I'm going
to be a little late.

468
00:27:40,233 --> 00:27:41,800
SARAH: He ain't
going to like it.

469
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:43,100
Just tell him.

470
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,633
OK.
- OK.

471
00:27:44,733 --> 00:27:45,533
Suit yourself.

472
00:27:50,633 --> 00:27:52,733
You haven't changed much.

473
00:27:52,833 --> 00:27:54,233
I can't help it.

474
00:27:54,333 --> 00:27:56,133
I've been cooped up with nothing
but guys for a long time.

475
00:27:56,233 --> 00:27:57,867
Well, don't look
at me for any relief.

476
00:27:57,967 --> 00:28:00,733
I'm presently spoken for.

477
00:28:00,833 --> 00:28:02,567
Some present.

478
00:28:02,667 --> 00:28:04,933
Who is that idiot anyway?

479
00:28:05,033 --> 00:28:08,067
His name is Johnny,
and he's not an idiot.

480
00:28:08,167 --> 00:28:10,167
Well, your taste has
certainly gone downhill.

481
00:28:10,267 --> 00:28:11,867
And your life has
certainly gone downhill.

482
00:28:11,967 --> 00:28:12,800
Hey, Mary.

483
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,033
Don't give me that crap.

484
00:28:14,133 --> 00:28:15,700
I was in the wrong
place at the wrong time.

485
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,800
Besides, I paid my dues.

486
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:20,267
It's an open-ended
debt, Jessie.

487
00:28:20,367 --> 00:28:22,567
My father was right
about you all along.

488
00:28:22,667 --> 00:28:23,933
You are no good.

489
00:28:24,033 --> 00:28:26,100
You got a mean streak in you,
and you're just plain wild.

490
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,533
A mean streak?

491
00:28:27,633 --> 00:28:28,900
Hey, I was minding my own
business the other night,

492
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,233
and bang, your Johnny
Boy there starts

493
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:31,833
selling me all kinds of shit.

494
00:28:31,933 --> 00:28:35,033
I believed in you, Jessie.

495
00:28:35,133 --> 00:28:39,367
I wrote you every day,
and not one word from you.

496
00:28:43,567 --> 00:28:47,300
Mary, I swear I never got
a single letter from you.

497
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,200
Nothing.

498
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:50,200
Don't.

499
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:53,200
Don't make it any worse for me.

500
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:54,767
I can't believe
you don't believe me.

501
00:28:54,867 --> 00:28:56,367
You can't?

502
00:28:56,467 --> 00:28:57,400
No.

503
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:58,767
I can't.

504
00:28:58,867 --> 00:28:59,667
Look.

505
00:28:59,767 --> 00:29:02,200
I loved you.

506
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:04,300
I've never stopped loving you.

507
00:29:17,467 --> 00:29:18,100
No.

508
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,100
Jessie, no.

509
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,433
I'm sorry, but I cannot do this.

Mary.

512
00:29:53,033 --> 00:29:55,000
Come on.

513
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:55,900
Come on.

514
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Get on.

515
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,267
You all right?

516
00:30:04,367 --> 00:30:05,167
I'm fine.

Want to let me see your
driver's license, boy?

00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,133
Is there a problem?

521
00:31:25,233 --> 00:31:26,267
You tell me.

522
00:31:26,367 --> 00:31:27,500
We weren't
speeding or anything.

523
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,867
I never said
you were speeding.

524
00:31:28,967 --> 00:31:30,067
Then, why are you stopping us?

525
00:31:32,433 --> 00:31:33,733
See.

526
00:31:33,833 --> 00:31:36,333
I promised your daddy I'd keep
an eye out for you, young lady.

527
00:31:36,433 --> 00:31:38,700
From the looks of
things, I don't

528
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,400
think that's such a bad idea.

529
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:41,700
Well, I think
it's an awful idea.

530
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,200
You have no right going
around harassing people,

531
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:44,300
pulling them over for no reason.

532
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,600
Oh, I've got a reason.
All right.

533
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:47,000
See.

534
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:48,300
There's been a lot of
motorcycles reported stolen

535
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,633
lately, and we're just
running a check on those

536
00:31:50,733 --> 00:31:54,000
that we don't think are
properly registered.

537
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:56,000
It's been a while since
you rode this, huh?

538
00:31:58,633 --> 00:31:59,533
I'm watching you, boy.

539
00:32:53,867 --> 00:32:55,533
Time to settle up
the books, Dillon.

540
00:32:55,633 --> 00:32:56,833
What?

541
00:32:56,933 --> 00:32:58,267
Are you trying to strong arm
me now or something, huh?

542
00:32:58,367 --> 00:32:59,667
Look.

543
00:32:59,767 --> 00:33:01,300
You little rat bastard, I told
you I ain't doing it no more.

544
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,967
OK.

545
00:33:03,067 --> 00:33:05,133
[laugh] Vinny, do
you believe this guy?

546
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:06,367
Listen, asshole.

547
00:33:06,467 --> 00:33:07,933
There ain't a fucking
thing in this town

00:33:08,033 --> 00:33:09,533
that we don't have
our fingers in.

549
00:33:09,633 --> 00:33:10,633
You understand?

550
00:33:10,733 --> 00:33:12,000
Now, how's it going
to look if some schmuck

551
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:13,200
with grease under
his fingernails

552
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:14,833
starts telling us
what to do, huh?

553
00:33:14,933 --> 00:33:16,133
Well, I guess we'll
lose a little bit

554
00:33:16,233 --> 00:33:17,933
of our great standing in
this fucking community.

555
00:33:18,033 --> 00:33:18,833
Look, man.

556
00:33:18,933 --> 00:33:20,033
I told you yesterday.

557
00:33:20,133 --> 00:33:21,200
It's just going to
take a little while.

558
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:22,033
OK.

559
00:33:22,133 --> 00:33:23,633
You're out of time, biker man.

560
00:33:23,733 --> 00:33:26,433
I want the money or the stuff,
and I want it right now.

561
00:33:26,533 --> 00:33:27,167
OK, fine.

562
00:33:27,267 --> 00:33:28,167
I'll tell you what.

563
00:33:28,267 --> 00:33:29,167
I'll run on over to Homewood.

564
00:33:29,267 --> 00:33:30,467
Pick up all the stuff.

565
00:33:30,567 --> 00:33:32,133
And then, I'll reassemble
the cars for you.

566
00:33:32,233 --> 00:33:34,000
Then, we can go
have a spot of tea.

567
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:35,300
Look, man.

568
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,200
You guys fuck with me,
and I'm going to spill

569
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:38,400
my guts all over City Hall.

570
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:39,900
And then, we'll see
who's time is up.

571
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:40,833
Man.
Oh, man.

572
00:33:40,933 --> 00:33:41,767
Oh, man.

573
00:33:41,867 --> 00:33:43,333
Wake up, Dillon.

574
00:33:43,433 --> 00:33:45,700
Don't you think you might have
a tough time proving anything?

575
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:46,900
No.

576
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:47,933
As a matter of fact,
it's probably one

577
00:33:48,033 --> 00:33:50,000
of the easiest things to do.

578
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:50,900
It's easy.

579
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:51,900
Easy?

580
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:52,900
I'll give you fucking easy.

581
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
RICO: All right, Vinny.
Hold on.

582
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:54,933
Hold on.

583
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:56,200
Hold on.

584
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:58,100
I'll tell you what.

585
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,833
Let's try a little experiment.

586
00:33:59,933 --> 00:34:02,100
You know, like, what's
that guy's name?

587
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,000
Mr. Wizard.

588
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:04,833
Yeah.

589
00:34:04,933 --> 00:34:06,100
Hey.

590
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,400
RICO: Let's see how
easy it is with a piece

591
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:08,933
of lead welded to your chest.

592
00:34:09,033 --> 00:34:11,367
[gunshots]

593
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:13,633
There.

594
00:34:13,733 --> 00:34:14,533
Now, you got easy.

595
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,167
Hell.

596
00:34:21,267 --> 00:34:23,567
I'd hoped this was
over between them.

597
00:34:23,667 --> 00:34:26,133
I figured he'd get the
message after the other night.

598
00:34:26,233 --> 00:34:28,300
DEPUTY ROGERS: Well, I thought
you just might want to know.

599
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:31,600
Looks like I may have to
go pay him another visit.

600
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:32,933
Is he still staying
with his brother?

601
00:34:33,033 --> 00:34:34,933
Yeah.
It's part of his probation.

602
00:34:35,033 --> 00:34:36,433
He's living with them.

603
00:34:36,533 --> 00:34:38,933
Some sort of deal his brother's
father-in-law put together

604
00:34:39,033 --> 00:34:40,767
with the probation department.

605
00:34:40,867 --> 00:34:41,667
All right.

606
00:34:41,767 --> 00:34:43,333
You keep an eye on him.

607
00:34:43,433 --> 00:34:45,967
If he does anything
sketchy, nail him.

608
00:34:46,067 --> 00:34:49,733
Goddamn punks, they got
no respect for anything.

609
00:34:49,833 --> 00:34:51,267
What's up, beautiful?

610
00:34:51,367 --> 00:34:52,867
My guard whenever
you're in the room.

611
00:34:52,967 --> 00:34:57,433
[chuckle]

612
00:34:57,533 --> 00:34:58,333
Sheriff's office.

613
00:34:58,433 --> 00:34:59,267
Wanda speaking.

614
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:02,700
It's for you.

615
00:35:08,433 --> 00:35:10,567
Rogers here.

616
00:35:10,667 --> 00:35:11,633
No.

617
00:35:11,733 --> 00:35:12,567
Hold up.

618
00:35:29,533 --> 00:35:30,433
Hey.

619
00:35:30,533 --> 00:35:32,300
I'm talking to you.

620
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,433
What's this shit I'm
hearing around town.

621
00:35:34,533 --> 00:35:35,867
It's nothing you've
not heard before.

622
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:37,800
I don't care about before.

623
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:41,233
I don't want you looking at
him, much less talking to him.

624
00:35:41,333 --> 00:35:44,467
Especially riding around on the
back of his goddamn motorcycle.

625
00:35:44,567 --> 00:35:46,633
Why is everything
always so black and white

626
00:35:46,733 --> 00:35:49,400
with you, Johnny?

627
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:54,067
You know, maybe I like riding
on the back of his bike.

628
00:35:54,167 --> 00:35:56,033
Maybe I like talking to him.

629
00:35:56,133 --> 00:35:58,167
Maybe I even like him.

630
00:35:58,267 --> 00:35:58,900
Oh.

631
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Oh, is that it?

632
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:03,800
You really like that
scum, don't you?

633
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:05,000
Oh great.

634
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:07,867
Just fucking great.

635
00:36:07,967 --> 00:36:10,200
Why don't you run off,
shoot some heroin,

636
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:11,467
smoke some coke with him?

637
00:36:11,567 --> 00:36:12,400
Yeah.

638
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:13,533
That's it.

639
00:36:13,633 --> 00:36:17,267
You, him, and his dolt
fucking friend Dillon.

640
00:36:17,367 --> 00:36:20,900
I heard you guys were pretty
good party pals before.

641
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,533
Hey, I got it, babe.

642
00:36:22,633 --> 00:36:25,900
Maybe you guys get together and
like driving stolen cars off.

643
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,267
You are joking me, Johnny.

644
00:36:28,367 --> 00:36:32,300
What am I supposed to do?

645
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,067
Can't you see how I feel?

646
00:36:35,167 --> 00:36:39,667
I have not seen Jessie
in over two years.

647
00:36:39,767 --> 00:36:40,967
I get it.

648
00:36:41,067 --> 00:36:43,133
I have to at least talk to him.

649
00:36:43,233 --> 00:36:45,867
That's the least
you should have done.

650
00:36:45,967 --> 00:36:46,800
Listen.

651
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:47,700
Listen.

652
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,200
Listen.
OK.

653
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:50,000
OK.

654
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:51,567
We have got to take a break.

655
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:54,167
At least until you
can see straight.

656
00:36:54,267 --> 00:36:57,400
I can see just fine, baby.

657
00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:00,700
You're the one who's
seeing cockeyed.

658
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:04,800
And if I ever catch that
asshole hanging around you again

659
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:07,133
I'm going to kick
his fucking ass.

660
00:37:07,233 --> 00:37:09,833
Do you understand that?

661
00:37:09,933 --> 00:37:11,933
Oh, I understand.

662
00:37:12,033 --> 00:37:14,333
I understand plenty.

663
00:37:14,433 --> 00:37:17,967
I understand that you are
more concerned with who you're

664
00:37:18,067 --> 00:37:20,800
with than who is with you.

665
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,267
Yo, Dillon.

666
00:37:47,367 --> 00:37:49,000
Where the hell are you?

667
00:37:53,867 --> 00:37:54,833
Oh my god.

668
00:37:54,933 --> 00:37:56,367
You're going to
be all right, man.

669
00:37:56,467 --> 00:37:57,367
You're going to be all right.

670
00:37:57,467 --> 00:37:59,900
Just-- just don't try to move.

671
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,400
Oh god.

672
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:05,667
Ambrose Chapel.

673
00:38:05,767 --> 00:38:08,000
Ambrose Chapel.

674
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:09,667
Dillon.
Dillon.

675
00:38:09,767 --> 00:38:10,600
Dillon!

676
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:12,167
Hold it right there.

677
00:38:12,267 --> 00:38:15,000
Place your hands directly behind
your head and stand up slowly.

678
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,333
You're under arrest.

679
00:38:20,433 --> 00:38:22,100
You have the right
to remain silent.

680
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,000
What are you talking about?
I didn't murder him.

681
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:25,267
He's my best friend
for Christ's sakes.

682
00:38:25,367 --> 00:38:26,633
I just walked in here.

683
00:38:26,733 --> 00:38:28,300
I just said you have the
right to remain silent.

684
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:31,167
I think it'd be in your best
interest to take my advice.

685
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:32,933
You've done it
this time, Jessie.

686
00:38:33,033 --> 00:38:35,467
You're going away
for good, punk.

687
00:38:35,567 --> 00:38:37,067
[electric sizzle]

688
00:38:50,533 --> 00:38:53,033
[saw buzzing]

689
00:38:53,967 --> 00:38:56,033
[motorcycle approaching]

690
00:39:00,767 --> 00:39:01,900
Paul.
Paul.

691
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,633
Paul, listen, man.
I'm in trouble.

692
00:39:03,733 --> 00:39:04,700
Dillon's dead.
- What?

693
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:05,900
Yeah.

694
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,267
I don't know what
the fuck's going on.

695
00:39:07,367 --> 00:39:08,700
I stopped over at his
house, right, to see him.

696
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,700
Fucking deputy shows up.

697
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:10,933
He's spread out on the ground.

698
00:39:11,033 --> 00:39:12,033
I don't know what
the fuck's happening.

699
00:39:12,133 --> 00:39:13,300
Somebody must have
killed him, man.

700
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,767
Deputy thinks I did it.
- All right.

701
00:39:14,867 --> 00:39:15,500
All right.
Listen.

702
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,067
Listen.

703
00:39:17,167 --> 00:39:19,233
Now, let's not get
crazy about this.

704
00:39:19,333 --> 00:39:20,600
Are you sure the
deputy's not dead?

705
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:21,500
No.

706
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,367
No.

707
00:39:22,467 --> 00:39:23,533
He was just out.
What the fuck?

708
00:39:23,633 --> 00:39:24,500
What am I going to do?

709
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:25,800
I don't know what to do.
- Slow down.

710
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:26,733
Slow down.

711
00:39:26,833 --> 00:39:27,667
Now, look.

712
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:34,333
Here.
Take this.

713
00:39:34,433 --> 00:39:35,733
Come on.
- What the hell's that for?

714
00:39:35,833 --> 00:39:37,033
No.

715
00:39:37,133 --> 00:39:37,833
I want you to take it
and get your butt over

716
00:39:37,933 --> 00:39:39,867
to Miller's cave.

717
00:39:39,967 --> 00:39:41,100
Take care of yourself.

718
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:44,733
And don't leave until
you hear from me.

719
00:39:44,833 --> 00:39:45,667
Get out of here.

720
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,233
Shit.

721
00:41:49,833 --> 00:41:50,633
Papa.

722
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:02,600
Why?

723
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:04,500
Why did you do this?

724
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:12,367
I trusted you to deliver
these letters to Jessie.

725
00:42:12,467 --> 00:42:16,867
You promised me that you
would give them to him.

726
00:42:16,967 --> 00:42:19,267
You had no right.

727
00:42:19,367 --> 00:42:22,500
You had no right to
go through my mail.

728
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:24,167
You had no right.

729
00:42:26,567 --> 00:42:31,500
I know you're seeing
him, and I want it to stop.

730
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:35,133
Now, either you take
care of it, or I will.

731
00:42:35,233 --> 00:42:37,200
It's up to you.

732
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:40,933
You do not own me.

733
00:42:41,033 --> 00:42:45,033
Nobody can tell me what
to think or what I want,

734
00:42:45,133 --> 00:42:46,233
or what I don't want.

735
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:50,667
I am not mama.

736
00:43:16,467 --> 00:43:18,767
[phone ringing]

737
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:29,233
Hello.

738
00:43:29,333 --> 00:43:30,100
WANDA (ON PHONE): May I speak
with the sheriff please?

739
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:31,033
Yes.
Just a minute.

740
00:43:35,567 --> 00:43:36,400
Phone.

741
00:43:42,667 --> 00:43:44,233
WANDA (ON PHONE): Sheriff,
this is very private.

742
00:43:44,333 --> 00:43:46,033
Is there anyone listening?
- No.

743
00:43:46,133 --> 00:43:47,300
WANDA (ON PHONE): Listen.

744
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:49,133
I have some information
about Jessie Weston.

745
00:43:49,233 --> 00:43:52,100
He's a suspect in the
murder of Dillon Thomas.

746
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:53,067
FRANK (ON PHONE): All right.

747
00:43:53,167 --> 00:43:55,767
Give me the details.

748
00:43:55,867 --> 00:43:58,100
First of all, when
did this happen?

749
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:00,067
It happened just
a couple hours ago.

750
00:44:00,167 --> 00:44:01,867
FRANK (ON PHONE): Is
Rogers at the scene?

751
00:44:01,967 --> 00:44:03,433
WANDA: No.
He's right here.

752
00:44:03,533 --> 00:44:05,133
He's waiting for Judge Walters
to swear out a search warrant.

753
00:44:05,233 --> 00:44:06,700
Do you want to talk to him?

754
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:09,667
No Tell him I'll meet him at
the crime scene in 30 minutes.

755
00:44:09,767 --> 00:44:11,167
WANDA (ON PHONE): Yes, sir.
I'll tell him.

756
00:44:11,267 --> 00:44:13,100
And I don't want anybody
to pick up that Weston

757
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:14,433
kid until I get there.

758
00:44:52,467 --> 00:44:56,367
[knocking]

759
00:44:59,833 --> 00:45:00,633
Yes.

760
00:45:00,733 --> 00:45:01,667
Is Jessie here?

761
00:45:01,767 --> 00:45:02,667
Come on in.

762
00:45:02,767 --> 00:45:03,567
Is he here?

763
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:14,733
DIANA: Well, you must be the
sheriff's daughter, Mary.

764
00:45:14,833 --> 00:45:15,733
Yes.

765
00:45:15,833 --> 00:45:16,733
Well, what can I do for you?

766
00:45:16,833 --> 00:45:18,833
I'm looking for Jessie.

767
00:45:18,933 --> 00:45:19,967
Would you like a drink, child?

768
00:45:20,067 --> 00:45:20,867
No.

769
00:45:20,967 --> 00:45:21,867
Thank you.

770
00:45:21,967 --> 00:45:22,967
I would like to talk to Jessie.

771
00:45:23,067 --> 00:45:25,500
Is he here?

772
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:29,500
Seems like everybody
needs to talk to Jessie.

773
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:31,367
After all, it's the
need in us that make

774
00:45:31,467 --> 00:45:34,133
men like him so attractive.

775
00:45:34,233 --> 00:45:37,000
He did an excellent job
fulfilling my needs.

776
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:39,433
Maybe you'll be
as lucky as I was.

777
00:45:39,533 --> 00:45:43,867
I'm sure he can fulfill
yours just fine.

778
00:45:43,967 --> 00:45:45,933
Just don't let his
brother catch on.

779
00:45:46,033 --> 00:45:48,467
Sibling rivalry can be so ugly.

780
00:45:48,567 --> 00:45:50,367
Listen.

781
00:45:50,467 --> 00:45:52,167
I don't know what
you're getting at.

782
00:45:52,267 --> 00:45:53,667
All I know is I need
to speak to Jessie.

783
00:45:53,767 --> 00:45:55,700
Is he here?

784
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:59,700
Actually, I think he's still
at work with his brother.

785
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:02,300
Of course, unfortunately,
I'm at a sudden loss

786
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:04,700
of memory for its location.

787
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:06,667
PAUL: That's odd, Diana.

788
00:46:06,767 --> 00:46:10,400
Your memory seemed to be working
just fine a few moments ago.

789
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:11,667
Is he here, Paul.
Where's Jessie?

790
00:46:11,767 --> 00:46:12,700
Please.
Please.

791
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:13,767
Is he at the work site?

792
00:46:13,867 --> 00:46:16,033
I really need to talk to him.

793
00:46:16,133 --> 00:46:16,967
He's in trouble, Mary.

794
00:46:17,067 --> 00:46:18,100
I know.

795
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:20,600
I overheard a phone
call for my dad,

796
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:21,533
from the sheriff's station.

797
00:46:21,633 --> 00:46:22,367
Listen.

798
00:46:22,467 --> 00:46:23,567
I know he didn't do anything.

799
00:46:23,667 --> 00:46:24,533
I just know it.
Please.

800
00:46:24,633 --> 00:46:25,467
Please.

801
00:46:25,567 --> 00:46:27,700
I need to talk to him.

802
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:30,000
I think he needs me.

803
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:31,600
Go wait in the car.

804
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:49,533
I'm going to the
sheriff's office.

805
00:46:49,633 --> 00:46:51,600
I'm going to talk to them
before they find Jessie.

806
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:53,300
And you really think
it's going to do any good.

807
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:56,900
Do you, Paul?
You're such a fool.

808
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,100
You're right, Diana.

809
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:01,733
I have been a fool,
and for too long.

810
00:47:01,833 --> 00:47:05,333
Don't leave, Paul.

811
00:47:05,433 --> 00:47:07,000
I was lying.

812
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:11,100
Nothing ever happened
between me and Jessie.

813
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:14,367
If you walk out that door,
don't ever come back.

814
00:47:21,033 --> 00:47:22,433
You really
disappoint me, Diana.

815
00:47:25,133 --> 00:47:26,633
Of course, you've done
that all your life.

816
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:36,033
[glass shatters]

817
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:49,233
[phone ringing]

818
00:47:49,333 --> 00:47:50,233
Hello.

819
00:47:50,333 --> 00:47:51,467
Yes.

820
00:47:51,567 --> 00:47:53,767
I have some information for
you about Jessie Weston.

821
00:48:12,867 --> 00:48:13,700
Fuck.

822
00:48:24,167 --> 00:48:26,667
[thudding]

823
00:48:29,167 --> 00:48:30,767
JOHNNY: Come out.

824
00:48:30,867 --> 00:48:34,100
Come out wherever you are.

825
00:48:48,467 --> 00:48:53,933
It's the top of the ninth,
and there's an upset in the air.

826
00:48:54,033 --> 00:48:55,200
Hey, bike boy.

827
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:57,700
Hey, little biker boy.

828
00:48:57,800 --> 00:49:02,933
You been riding the wrong
side of town, biker boy.

829
00:49:03,033 --> 00:49:04,300
We know who you are.

830
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,400
And we know what you done.

831
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:09,300
Bases are loaded, and
it's your turn to run.

832
00:49:15,767 --> 00:49:17,233
GUY: Kick his ass, Johnny Boy.

833
00:49:17,333 --> 00:49:20,400
Teach him a lesson.

834
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:22,400
[grunting]

835
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:23,400
Kick his butt.

836
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:24,400
Tie into him, man.

837
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:25,300
Come on.

838
00:49:29,967 --> 00:49:30,800
Yeah.

839
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:33,200
Do it.

840
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:36,367
GUY: We got your
back, Johnny Boy.

841
00:49:36,467 --> 00:49:37,767
[thud]

842
00:49:37,867 --> 00:49:38,767
Get him, man.

843
00:49:43,833 --> 00:49:44,733
GUY: Yeah.

844
00:49:44,833 --> 00:49:46,733
Good hit.

845
00:49:46,833 --> 00:49:49,400
He's down for the count.

846
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:50,300
Yeah.

847
00:49:57,800 --> 00:49:58,700
Look out!

848
00:50:03,767 --> 00:50:04,667
GUY: Come on, John.

849
00:50:04,767 --> 00:50:07,067
Get up.

850
00:50:07,167 --> 00:50:08,233
Get up, man.

851
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:17,200
Come on.

852
00:51:04,567 --> 00:51:07,467
Get up, man.

853
00:51:07,567 --> 00:51:09,467
[motorcycle starts]

854
00:51:15,533 --> 00:51:16,433
[grunt]

855
00:51:20,533 --> 00:51:21,400
[explosion]

856
00:51:37,467 --> 00:51:39,367
Fucker!

857
00:51:39,467 --> 00:51:40,767
You did it!

858
00:51:40,867 --> 00:51:43,333
You fucking did it.

859
00:51:43,433 --> 00:51:44,333
[scream]

860
00:51:44,433 --> 00:51:45,267
Shit!

861
00:51:55,400 --> 00:52:01,333
[scream]

862
00:52:01,433 --> 00:52:03,400
I was going back
to turn myself in.

863
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:05,933
I figured I'd get somebody
to listen this time.

864
00:52:06,033 --> 00:52:07,667
What a fucking joke.

865
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:12,367
Man, this is getting crazy.

866
00:52:12,467 --> 00:52:14,633
The last thing in the world I
want to do is go back to jail.

867
00:52:14,733 --> 00:52:15,633
Look.

868
00:52:15,733 --> 00:52:16,767
Look.

869
00:52:16,867 --> 00:52:17,833
You can't turn
yourself in anyway.

870
00:52:17,933 --> 00:52:19,733
At least, not right now.

871
00:52:19,833 --> 00:52:21,100
Not until I talk to my father.

872
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:22,433
I mean, he is going
to listen to me.

873
00:52:22,533 --> 00:52:24,200
Fuck.
Forget it.

874
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:26,167
He'd string me up
faster than any of them.

875
00:52:26,267 --> 00:52:27,867
He's been out to get
me since day one.

876
00:52:27,967 --> 00:52:28,900
No.

877
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:29,800
No.

878
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:30,933
I know what I got to do.

879
00:52:31,033 --> 00:52:32,300
No.
No.

880
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:33,067
Look.

881
00:52:33,167 --> 00:52:34,733
We're going to go back.

882
00:52:34,833 --> 00:52:35,700
We're going to talk to him.

883
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:36,800
You don't understand, Mary.

884
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:37,967
I can't.
- I am telling you--

885
00:52:38,067 --> 00:52:39,633
Look.
I just can't.

886
00:52:39,733 --> 00:52:42,600
- He's going to under--
- No!

887
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:44,100
Don't you understand?

888
00:52:46,967 --> 00:52:49,533
Your father is the one that
beat me up the other night.

889
00:52:49,633 --> 00:52:52,400
What?

890
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:54,167
Yeah.

891
00:52:54,267 --> 00:52:57,000
His deputy held me up
while he worked me over.

892
00:52:57,100 --> 00:52:58,600
Don't you understand?

893
00:52:58,700 --> 00:52:59,700
Don't you get it?

894
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:02,000
We're not supposed
to be together.

895
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:02,933
It can't be.

896
00:53:03,033 --> 00:53:03,933
We can't be.

897
00:53:04,033 --> 00:53:04,867
No.

898
00:53:04,967 --> 00:53:05,767
I don't believe it.

899
00:53:05,867 --> 00:53:07,867
I don't believe you.

900
00:53:07,967 --> 00:53:09,667
You didn't believe
the letters either.

901
00:53:09,767 --> 00:53:10,567
But goddammit.

902
00:53:10,667 --> 00:53:12,133
I believed you.

903
00:53:12,233 --> 00:53:13,567
I waited for you.

904
00:53:13,667 --> 00:53:16,200
That's all I've been doing
for the last two years.

905
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:21,000
Waiting to be with you.

906
00:53:21,100 --> 00:53:24,000
The letters.

907
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:26,467
I found them.

908
00:53:26,567 --> 00:53:27,400
You were right.

909
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,900
My father kept them from me.

910
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:33,967
I didn't know.

911
00:53:34,067 --> 00:53:36,467
I swear.

912
00:53:36,567 --> 00:53:38,567
I wrote them.

913
00:53:38,667 --> 00:53:41,567
He promised me that
he'd send them to you.

914
00:53:41,667 --> 00:53:44,200
He promised.

915
00:53:44,300 --> 00:53:46,367
He didn't send them.

916
00:53:46,467 --> 00:53:48,133
He kept them.

917
00:53:48,233 --> 00:53:50,000
He didn't send them at all.

918
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:54,167
Listen, Jessie.

919
00:53:54,267 --> 00:53:58,733
We have got to find out
who killed Dillon and why.

920
00:53:58,833 --> 00:54:03,000
We cannot go back until we
prove that you were innocent.

921
00:54:03,100 --> 00:54:06,067
We cannot stop until we
have convinced my father.

922
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:10,700
Ambrose Chapel.

923
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:14,033
It's-- it's the last thing
Dillon said before he--

924
00:54:17,967 --> 00:54:18,867
oh, man.

925
00:54:18,967 --> 00:54:20,467
Why'd they have to kill him?

926
00:54:27,033 --> 00:54:28,000
Ambrose Chapel.

927
00:54:30,933 --> 00:54:32,100
Yeah.

928
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:33,567
When I got there, he
was barely breathing.

929
00:54:33,667 --> 00:54:35,200
He tried to talk, but the
only thing I could make out

930
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:36,300
was Ambrose Chapel.

931
00:54:39,167 --> 00:54:40,067
Dirty bastards.

932
00:54:40,167 --> 00:54:41,933
If I could get my hands on them.

933
00:54:42,033 --> 00:54:45,467
MARY: I know that
this is hard for you.

934
00:54:45,567 --> 00:54:46,733
But he is gone.

935
00:54:53,867 --> 00:54:55,600
Ambrose Chapel.

936
00:54:55,700 --> 00:54:56,633
It's a church.

937
00:54:58,833 --> 00:54:59,667
Yeah.
But what church?

938
00:54:59,767 --> 00:55:00,567
Where?

939
00:55:04,867 --> 00:55:06,667
Homewood.

940
00:55:06,767 --> 00:55:08,167
It's a church in Homewood.

941
00:55:08,267 --> 00:55:10,800
It's an old church.

942
00:55:10,900 --> 00:55:11,933
You know where it is?

943
00:55:12,033 --> 00:55:13,467
Yeah.

944
00:55:13,567 --> 00:55:15,700
I remember my mom used to take
me there when I was little.

945
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:16,667
Ambrose Chapel.

946
00:55:16,767 --> 00:55:18,567
It's a church in Homewood.

947
00:55:18,667 --> 00:55:20,633
It was the only Catholic
church for miles around there.

948
00:55:23,933 --> 00:55:26,000
Dillon in a church.

949
00:55:26,100 --> 00:55:27,733
Just doesn't sound
right, does it?

950
00:55:27,833 --> 00:55:31,033
I mean, Dillon in a church.

951
00:55:31,133 --> 00:55:32,267
I don't know.

952
00:55:32,367 --> 00:55:33,600
They just don't seem
to go hand in hand.

953
00:55:37,633 --> 00:55:40,200
So you know exactly
where this church is?

954
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:41,133
Yeah.

955
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:32,700
Stop looking at him.

956
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:33,633
Shoot him.

957
00:56:36,567 --> 00:56:38,633
Look at this, Rico.

958
00:56:38,733 --> 00:56:39,933
Oh no.

959
00:56:40,033 --> 00:56:41,300
They couldn't hit the
broad side of a barn.

960
00:56:45,667 --> 00:56:47,567
[phone ringing]

961
00:56:48,567 --> 00:56:50,833
Man.

962
00:56:50,933 --> 00:56:53,733
Yeah.

963
00:56:53,833 --> 00:56:56,767
He what?

964
00:56:56,867 --> 00:56:59,167
Did he talk?

965
00:56:59,267 --> 00:57:01,800
[sigh] Don't worry about it.

966
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:03,733
We'll find them.

967
00:57:03,833 --> 00:57:05,100
I said don't worry about it.

968
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:09,000
We'll get to him first.

969
00:57:09,100 --> 00:57:09,900
A girl.

970
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,000
What girl?

971
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:13,633
Yeah.

972
00:57:13,733 --> 00:57:15,600
Yeah.

973
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:17,867
Don't worry about it.

974
00:57:17,967 --> 00:57:18,833
We'll take care of her too.

975
00:57:18,933 --> 00:57:21,167
It's no big deal.

976
00:57:21,267 --> 00:57:22,600
Yeah.
Yeah.

977
00:57:22,700 --> 00:57:23,367
Yeah.
Yeah.

978
00:57:23,467 --> 00:57:24,800
Yeah.
Yeah.

979
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:27,967
What's the matter?

980
00:57:28,067 --> 00:57:29,800
Get ready.
We got work to do.

981
00:57:34,033 --> 00:57:34,833
I can't believe it.

982
00:57:34,933 --> 00:57:36,800
I just can't believe it.

983
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:37,733
I was in a hurry.

984
00:57:37,833 --> 00:57:38,867
I didn't think to check.

985
00:57:38,967 --> 00:57:40,033
You didn't think to check?
Great.

986
00:57:40,133 --> 00:57:40,833
That's just great.

987
00:57:40,933 --> 00:57:42,067
What's the matter?

988
00:57:42,167 --> 00:57:42,933
You forget to borrow
daddy's credit card?

989
00:57:43,033 --> 00:57:44,333
Listen.

990
00:57:44,433 --> 00:57:45,800
I came out here to help you.

991
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:48,133
Ah, big help you
turned out to be.

992
00:57:48,233 --> 00:57:49,833
You ungrateful bastard.

993
00:57:49,933 --> 00:57:51,000
I ought to have my
old man hang you.

994
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:52,133
You might as well.
No.

995
00:57:52,233 --> 00:57:53,200
Wait.
I got a better one for you.

996
00:57:53,300 --> 00:57:54,567
Just tell him I kidnapped you.

997
00:57:54,667 --> 00:57:58,567
I'm sure the whole town
would just love that one.

998
00:57:58,667 --> 00:57:59,500
Wait.

999
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:01,000
Where are you going?

1000
00:58:01,100 --> 00:58:02,467
You what?

1001
00:58:02,567 --> 00:58:04,067
You gonna leave me out here
in the middle of nowhere?

1002
00:58:04,167 --> 00:58:06,500
Just turn the damn car
around and coast the hell back.

1003
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:18,133
- [sob]
- Mary, I'm--

1004
00:58:23,933 --> 00:58:24,833
I'm sorry.

1005
00:58:24,933 --> 00:58:26,400
That's all right.

1006
00:58:29,267 --> 00:58:32,700
I think I'm losing it.

1007
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:33,800
What are we going to do?

1008
00:58:33,900 --> 00:58:34,733
I'm cold.

1009
00:58:38,300 --> 00:58:40,633
Well, the first thing we got
to do is get off this road.

1010
00:58:46,300 --> 00:58:47,667
Here.

1011
00:58:47,767 --> 00:58:48,600
Thanks.

1012
00:58:51,133 --> 00:58:55,967
If uh-- if we cut through
here and head back over

1013
00:58:56,067 --> 00:58:58,367
towards Miller's
Crossing, we'll probably

1014
00:58:58,467 --> 00:58:59,833
get to Homewood by morning.

1015
00:58:59,933 --> 00:59:00,900
All right.

1016
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:01,800
Come on.

1017
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:14,233
Let's go.

1018
00:59:17,133 --> 00:59:20,167
JESSIE: Seems like no
matter what I do I find

1019
00:59:20,267 --> 00:59:24,133
myself in a no win situation.

1020
00:59:24,233 --> 00:59:26,300
I come to a crossing
in the road and bang.

1021
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:31,267
I think about the consequences,
but I just can't seem

1022
00:59:31,367 --> 00:59:33,667
to make the right decisions.

1023
00:59:33,767 --> 00:59:34,633
There are never any answers.

1024
00:59:34,733 --> 00:59:35,800
No directions.

1025
00:59:39,633 --> 00:59:42,233
I know there's got to be a light
at the end of the tunnel, but--

1026
00:59:46,900 --> 00:59:53,100
I remember-- I remember when
I was a kid, I used to--

1027
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:57,500
I used to follow my brother
and his buddies up here.

1028
00:59:57,600 --> 01:00:01,300
They'd come up on Saturday
nights and drink beers.

1029
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:06,433
I used to sneak around
in here and watch them.

1030
01:00:06,533 --> 01:00:08,567
Sometimes, they'd bring
girls up here and they'd--

1031
01:00:11,333 --> 01:00:15,100
well, they'd get
a taste of life.

1032
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:17,567
They'd smoke cigarettes
and drink beers until they

1033
01:00:17,667 --> 01:00:21,467
couldn't stand up and just--

1034
01:00:21,567 --> 01:00:24,133
just be a part of it.

1035
01:00:24,233 --> 01:00:25,600
Just be a part of it all.

1036
01:00:29,067 --> 01:00:30,100
It's funny.

1037
01:00:33,367 --> 01:00:35,733
I just couldn't fit in.

1038
01:00:35,833 --> 01:00:37,467
No matter how hard I tried, I--

1039
01:00:40,300 --> 01:00:41,767
I just couldn't feel it.

1040
01:00:46,067 --> 01:00:47,400
Even when they'd catch
me and let me hang out

1041
01:00:47,500 --> 01:00:49,000
I'd take a swig of
their beer or a drag

1042
01:00:49,100 --> 01:00:49,933
off of one of their smokes.

1043
01:00:50,033 --> 01:00:55,467
But it wasn't the same.

1044
01:00:55,567 --> 01:00:59,433
It just wasn't the same.

1045
01:00:59,533 --> 01:01:00,300
It's crazy.

1046
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:03,667
It's like-- it's
like all my life

1047
01:01:03,767 --> 01:01:05,333
I've never really been
invited to a party.

1048
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:22,500
I'm just-- I'm just so
tired of not being invited.

1049
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:36,233
I'm just tired of
not being invited.

1050
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:42,567
Dillon was the only one
who ever understood.

1051
01:01:42,667 --> 01:01:45,533
I'm sorry about Dillon.

1052
01:01:45,633 --> 01:01:46,433
Yeah.

1053
01:01:46,533 --> 01:01:48,933
Me too.

1054
01:01:49,033 --> 01:01:51,033
I'm sorry about Dillon.

1055
01:01:51,133 --> 01:01:52,100
I'm sorry about Johnny.

1056
01:01:54,767 --> 01:01:55,700
I'm sorry about us.

1057
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:56,600
No.

1058
01:01:56,700 --> 01:01:59,033
Don't say it.

1059
01:01:59,133 --> 01:02:00,200
Don't say it, Jessie.

1060
01:02:09,100 --> 01:02:12,167
[romantic music playing]

1061
01:03:52,133 --> 01:03:54,433
[moaning]

1062
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:11,900
All right.

1063
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:13,800
I need a few good men
to hang tight with me.

1064
01:04:13,900 --> 01:04:15,533
Have any of you
boys seen combat?

1065
01:04:15,633 --> 01:04:16,467
Yeah.

1066
01:04:16,567 --> 01:04:17,200
I seen combat.

1067
01:04:17,300 --> 01:04:19,600
You were at the Gulf?

1068
01:04:19,700 --> 01:04:21,067
No.

1069
01:04:21,167 --> 01:04:23,267
Well, then where
did you see combat?

1070
01:04:23,367 --> 01:04:25,633
Reruns on channel 12.

1071
01:04:25,733 --> 01:04:27,700
What?

1072
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:28,600
All right.

1073
01:04:28,700 --> 01:04:29,533
Look.

1074
01:04:29,633 --> 01:04:31,233
You guys, just follow me.

1075
01:04:31,333 --> 01:04:32,067
Shit.

1076
01:04:32,167 --> 01:04:33,467
I'm leading an army of idiots.

1077
01:04:39,567 --> 01:04:40,367
All right.

1078
01:04:40,467 --> 01:04:41,333
Take it easy.

1079
01:04:41,433 --> 01:04:42,067
Nobody moves.

1080
01:04:42,167 --> 01:04:43,000
Nobody gets hurt.

1081
01:04:43,100 --> 01:04:44,000
Wait a minute.

1082
01:04:44,100 --> 01:04:44,933
It's me you want.

1083
01:04:45,033 --> 01:04:46,233
Just let her go.

1084
01:04:46,333 --> 01:04:48,233
[laugh]

1085
01:04:48,333 --> 01:04:50,067
I don't want either one of you.

1086
01:04:50,167 --> 01:04:51,600
But I do want a
little information.

1087
01:04:51,700 --> 01:04:53,500
Get over here.

1088
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:56,500
What information?

1089
01:04:56,600 --> 01:04:58,233
What did Dillon tell
you before he died?

1090
01:05:02,333 --> 01:05:03,767
- Please just--
- Shut up.

1091
01:05:03,867 --> 01:05:05,033
[yelp]

1092
01:05:05,133 --> 01:05:06,800
Now, just shut the
fuck up, both of you.

1093
01:05:06,900 --> 01:05:09,200
Listen.
Wait a minute.

1094
01:05:09,300 --> 01:05:10,467
I got something you want.

1095
01:05:10,567 --> 01:05:12,400
If you don't hurt her,
I'll give it to you.

1096
01:05:12,500 --> 01:05:13,600
You punk.

1097
01:05:13,700 --> 01:05:15,033
If I want something, what
makes you think I won't

1098
01:05:15,133 --> 01:05:16,200
just take it from you, huh?

1099
01:05:16,300 --> 01:05:18,067
Because it's not on me.

1100
01:05:18,167 --> 01:05:19,600
I'm talking about the
money Dillon owed you.

1101
01:05:19,700 --> 01:05:21,800
I know where it is.

1102
01:05:21,900 --> 01:05:22,700
Oh yeah?

1103
01:05:28,333 --> 01:05:30,167
All right, wise guy.

1104
01:05:30,267 --> 01:05:31,233
You lead the way.

1105
01:05:52,167 --> 01:05:53,433
What are you stopping for, man?

1106
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:03,467
It's buried right there.

1107
01:06:03,567 --> 01:06:05,733
Well, then get to work.

1108
01:06:05,833 --> 01:06:07,167
And you, get over there.

1109
01:06:13,100 --> 01:06:14,133
[giggle]

1110
01:06:17,267 --> 01:06:18,900
All right.
That's enough.

1111
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:20,300
Vinny, get over there
and start digging.

1112
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:23,200
What do I look
like, a fucking idiot?

1113
01:06:23,300 --> 01:06:25,067
Just fucking do it, man.

1114
01:06:25,167 --> 01:06:26,967
I don't want nothing
showing up but the money

1115
01:06:27,067 --> 01:06:28,067
if you get my meaning.

1116
01:06:40,100 --> 01:06:41,467
Get away from me.

1117
01:06:41,567 --> 01:06:42,233
Smell so good.

1118
01:06:42,333 --> 01:06:43,800
You sassy little thing.

1119
01:06:43,900 --> 01:06:44,700
I like that.

1120
01:06:48,233 --> 01:06:51,733
Just don't hurt me.

1121
01:06:51,833 --> 01:06:52,833
Oh, baby.

1122
01:06:52,933 --> 01:06:56,433
That's the last
thing on my mind.

1123
01:06:56,533 --> 01:06:58,767
Ugh.

1124
01:06:58,867 --> 01:07:00,433
Now, let her go.

1125
01:07:00,533 --> 01:07:01,367
That's enough.

1126
01:07:01,467 --> 01:07:02,433
Now, let her go.

1127
01:07:02,533 --> 01:07:03,400
I don't think that's
a very good idea.

1128
01:07:03,500 --> 01:07:05,200
Do you?
- I said let her go.

1129
01:07:05,300 --> 01:07:06,100
Come on, big man.

1130
01:07:06,200 --> 01:07:07,200
Pull the trigger.

1131
01:07:07,300 --> 01:07:07,967
Come on.

1132
01:07:08,067 --> 01:07:09,100
Come on.

1133
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:10,000
I'll blow your
fucking brains out.

1134
01:07:10,100 --> 01:07:11,267
RICO: Come on!
Come on!

1135
01:07:11,367 --> 01:07:13,400
I'll blow your
fucking brains out!

1136
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:14,533
Jessie!

1137
01:07:14,633 --> 01:07:16,500
[gunshots]

1138
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:18,933
Come on.
Come on.

1139
01:07:19,033 --> 01:07:20,033
Come on.

1140
01:09:50,367 --> 01:09:51,200
Jessie!

1141
01:10:10,667 --> 01:10:12,567
Come on.

1142
01:10:12,667 --> 01:10:15,567
Grab it.

1143
01:10:15,667 --> 01:10:16,567
Come on.

1144
01:10:16,667 --> 01:10:17,567
I can't.

1145
01:10:17,667 --> 01:10:19,133
I can't reach it.

1146
01:10:30,133 --> 01:10:31,133
Come on.

1147
01:10:36,067 --> 01:10:37,533
MARY: I can't reach you.

1148
01:10:45,033 --> 01:10:46,100
He's coming.

1149
01:11:09,667 --> 01:11:10,467
Jessie.

1150
01:11:15,567 --> 01:11:17,067
[grunting]

1151
01:11:22,067 --> 01:11:23,033
Help us.

1152
01:11:43,933 --> 01:11:45,833
[gunshot]

1153
01:11:45,933 --> 01:11:47,500
MARY: Oh no.

1154
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:48,867
What the hell are
you trying to do?

1155
01:11:48,967 --> 01:11:49,767
You're going to hit Mary.

1156
01:12:00,033 --> 01:12:19,233
[grunting]

1157
01:12:19,333 --> 01:12:20,200
She'll be all right.

1158
01:12:20,300 --> 01:12:21,367
They'll find them.

1159
01:12:21,467 --> 01:12:22,633
They couldn't have gotten far.

1160
01:12:30,533 --> 01:12:31,567
Wait.
Look.

1161
01:12:31,667 --> 01:12:32,367
It's a boat.

1162
01:12:32,467 --> 01:12:33,600
We can cut across the lake.

1163
01:12:33,700 --> 01:12:34,633
Homewood's just a
few miles downstream.

1164
01:12:34,733 --> 01:12:35,567
Come on.

1165
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:49,633
Sheriff, I want to talk
to you about my brother.

1166
01:12:49,733 --> 01:12:51,700
I have some information
you might want to hear.

1167
01:13:01,467 --> 01:13:03,900
He's got nothing
to do with this.

1168
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:05,200
Listen.

1169
01:13:05,300 --> 01:13:07,400
So far I've got a dead
body lying on a garage

1170
01:13:07,500 --> 01:13:10,067
floor and a deputy
who saw your brother

1171
01:13:10,167 --> 01:13:11,700
at the scene of the crime.

1172
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:14,700
He's wanted for suspicion
of murder and assault

1173
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:15,633
on the deputy.

1174
01:13:28,633 --> 01:13:29,767
[gunshot]

1175
01:13:29,867 --> 01:13:31,500
I cannot believe they're
actually shooting at us.

1176
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:35,133
Jesus Christ.
What are you crazy?

1177
01:13:35,233 --> 01:13:37,667
[boat engine starts]

1178
01:13:48,067 --> 01:13:49,133
Jesus.

1179
01:13:49,233 --> 01:13:50,367
We're taking on water.
- Oh my good.

1180
01:13:50,467 --> 01:13:51,700
JESSIE: Must have
been that gunshot.

1181
01:13:59,333 --> 01:14:00,833
- Looks like we're losing them.
- All right.

1182
01:14:00,933 --> 01:14:02,367
OK.

1183
01:14:02,467 --> 01:14:03,900
Merv, I want you to stay with
the truck and the squad car.

1184
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,500
Take a walkie talkie out of the
squad car and hold on to it.

1185
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:08,267
I'll keep in touch
with you from mine.

1186
01:14:08,367 --> 01:14:10,467
The rest of you
boys, come with me.

1187
01:14:22,733 --> 01:14:23,667
What are you doing?

1188
01:14:23,767 --> 01:14:24,567
Get back.

1189
01:14:45,800 --> 01:14:47,800
What the hell was that?

1190
01:14:47,900 --> 01:14:48,700
Come on.

1191
01:15:00,300 --> 01:15:03,100
So far he's wanted
for suspicion of murder,

1192
01:15:03,200 --> 01:15:06,067
assault on a police
officer, and kidnapping.

1193
01:15:06,167 --> 01:15:07,000
Kidnapping?

1194
01:15:07,100 --> 01:15:08,133
That's what I said.

1195
01:15:13,267 --> 01:15:15,000
If you've got something to
say to me that will help me

1196
01:15:15,100 --> 01:15:16,800
get to your brother
before a bullet does,

1197
01:15:16,900 --> 01:15:18,633
you better make it fast.

1198
01:15:18,733 --> 01:15:21,933
Because I'm not about to lose
my daughter to a punk two-bit

1199
01:15:22,033 --> 01:15:23,100
hustler.

1200
01:15:23,200 --> 01:15:24,000
Now hold on.

1201
01:15:24,100 --> 01:15:26,300
Just wait.

1202
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:27,700
Look.

1203
01:15:27,800 --> 01:15:30,167
I'll tell you what Dillon told
my brother just before he died.

1204
01:15:30,267 --> 01:15:32,933
But you got to promise
to take me with you.

1205
01:15:33,033 --> 01:15:34,000
My brother's
innocent, and I want

1206
01:15:34,100 --> 01:15:35,133
to make sure he stays alive.

1207
01:15:49,333 --> 01:15:50,033
[clink]

1208
01:15:50,133 --> 01:15:51,600
[car starts]

1209
01:15:51,700 --> 01:15:52,600
[tires squeal]

1210
01:15:52,700 --> 01:15:53,600
Hey!

1211
01:15:53,700 --> 01:15:56,000
Hey!

1212
01:15:56,100 --> 01:15:59,033
Looks like they went down.

1213
01:15:59,133 --> 01:16:00,067
Anybody see any body parts?

1214
01:16:00,167 --> 01:16:00,967
Hey, Merv.

1215
01:16:01,067 --> 01:16:02,667
You out there?

1216
01:16:02,767 --> 01:16:03,600
MERV: I'm here.

1217
01:16:03,700 --> 01:16:04,933
Go ahead, sir.
- Yeah.

1218
01:16:05,033 --> 01:16:06,467
I want you to come pick us up.

1219
01:16:06,567 --> 01:16:10,867
We're about three miles past
the fork at Miller's Crossing.

1220
01:16:10,967 --> 01:16:12,533
Deputy, listen to me.

1221
01:16:12,633 --> 01:16:14,467
They're alive.

1222
01:16:14,567 --> 01:16:15,367
I can feel it.

1223
01:16:15,467 --> 01:16:16,267
Listen.

1224
01:16:16,367 --> 01:16:17,500
I understand how you feel.
OK.

1225
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:18,867
But I've got to report
in to the sheriff

1226
01:16:18,967 --> 01:16:20,267
before we go any further.

1227
01:16:20,367 --> 01:16:21,500
Look.

1228
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:22,900
We're going to drag the lake
for the bodies tomorrow.

1229
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:24,700
If they don't show
up, we'll decide then

1230
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:26,100
whether to continue the search.

1231
01:16:26,200 --> 01:16:28,733
But for now, I need you
guys to head back into town.

1232
01:16:28,833 --> 01:16:31,333
Await further instructions
from either me or the sheriff

1233
01:16:31,433 --> 01:16:32,233
directly.

1234
01:16:32,333 --> 01:16:33,533
OK.

1235
01:16:33,633 --> 01:16:34,367
Do you understand?

1236
01:16:34,467 --> 01:16:37,500
I mean that goes for everybody.

1237
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:38,433
Let's go.

1238
01:16:41,400 --> 01:16:42,300
You see it.

1239
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:46,000
I swear it was
around here somewhere.

1240
01:16:46,100 --> 01:16:47,400
Well, it ain't here now.

1241
01:16:47,500 --> 01:16:49,500
MARY: My mother and I
used to always come here.

1242
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:50,433
It's gone.

1243
01:16:55,867 --> 01:16:57,167
Ambrose Chapel?

1244
01:16:57,267 --> 01:16:58,067
That's what he said.

1245
01:16:58,167 --> 01:16:59,967
Ambrose Chapel.

1246
01:17:00,067 --> 01:17:01,333
A church?

1247
01:17:01,433 --> 01:17:02,433
Not anymore.

1248
01:17:02,533 --> 01:17:04,333
I heard they put up
an apartment building.

1249
01:17:12,633 --> 01:17:14,000
All right, you boys.

1250
01:17:14,100 --> 01:17:15,967
You just head on home now.

1251
01:17:16,067 --> 01:17:17,233
Looks like we're going
to meet back here

1252
01:17:17,333 --> 01:17:18,933
at sunrise to drag the lake.

1253
01:17:19,033 --> 01:17:20,067
Nothing more we can do now.

1254
01:17:34,267 --> 01:17:36,767
This is dispatch calling
all available units.

1255
01:17:36,867 --> 01:17:38,100
Sheriff, where are you?

1256
01:17:38,200 --> 01:17:39,567
What's your 20, Sheriff?

1257
01:17:39,667 --> 01:17:40,967
Come in please

1258
01:17:41,067 --> 01:17:42,733
FRANK (ON RADIO):
I'm eastbound on 10.

1259
01:17:42,833 --> 01:17:44,333
What's up?

1260
01:17:44,433 --> 01:17:46,600
Sheriff, we got a stolen
vehicle report at the gas

1261
01:17:46,700 --> 01:17:48,133
station at Mill Creek Road.

1262
01:17:48,233 --> 01:17:49,867
Suspects fit the
description of one

1263
01:17:49,967 --> 01:17:51,700
Jessie Weston,
wanted for murder,

1264
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:55,133
and Mary Dayton, kidnap victim.

1265
01:17:55,233 --> 01:17:56,100
FRANK (ON RADIO): All right.

1266
01:17:56,200 --> 01:17:57,433
I'm on my way.

1267
01:17:57,533 --> 01:17:58,333
Out.

1268
01:18:09,733 --> 01:18:11,033
Now, this is progress.

1269
01:18:11,133 --> 01:18:13,467
Tear down a church and
build an apartment complex.

1270
01:18:13,567 --> 01:18:14,700
What the hell
is going on here.

1271
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:16,333
I don't know.

1272
01:18:16,433 --> 01:18:17,600
Do you think Dillon
had something

1273
01:18:17,700 --> 01:18:18,700
hidden in that church?

1274
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:19,600
Hell.

1275
01:18:19,700 --> 01:18:21,067
I don't know.

1276
01:18:21,167 --> 01:18:22,867
Maybe we're too late.

1277
01:18:22,967 --> 01:18:24,467
Maybe-- maybe he
had an apartment here.

1278
01:18:24,567 --> 01:18:25,533
No No.

1279
01:18:25,633 --> 01:18:26,933
He lived in the
back of his garage.

1280
01:18:27,033 --> 01:18:28,200
OK.

1281
01:18:28,300 --> 01:18:29,567
Well, then maybe he
was going to move here.

1282
01:18:29,667 --> 01:18:34,700
Well, if that's the case,
maybe he had a mailbox.

1283
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:35,600
Look for his name.

1284
01:18:35,700 --> 01:18:36,700
Dillon Thomas.

1285
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:38,000
Dillon Thomas.
- Dillon.

1286
01:18:38,100 --> 01:18:38,933
Dillon.
Dillon.

1287
01:18:39,033 --> 01:18:40,100
Dillon.

1288
01:18:40,200 --> 01:18:43,833
You know, is that
like Matt or Bob?

1289
01:18:43,933 --> 01:18:45,100
That's it.
That's it.

1290
01:18:45,200 --> 01:18:46,433
That's one right there.

1291
01:18:46,533 --> 01:18:47,367
Zimmerman?

1292
01:18:47,467 --> 01:18:48,200
That's it?

1293
01:18:48,300 --> 01:18:49,833
Zimmerman.
- Yup.

1294
01:18:49,933 --> 01:18:50,733
Zimmerman.

1295
01:18:50,833 --> 01:18:51,900
How do you figure?

1296
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:53,500
What did you just
say a minute ago?

1297
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:54,600
- Zimmerman.
- No.

1298
01:18:54,700 --> 01:18:56,133
Before when you were
talking about his name.

1299
01:18:56,233 --> 01:18:58,600
You know, you asked if
it was after Bob or Matt.

1300
01:18:58,700 --> 01:19:00,233
- So.
- That's it.

1301
01:19:00,333 --> 01:19:01,933
Don't you get it?
Bob Zimmerman.

1302
01:19:02,033 --> 01:19:03,400
That's Bob Dylan's real name.

1303
01:19:03,500 --> 01:19:06,600
Bob Zimmerman.

1304
01:19:06,700 --> 01:19:07,500
All right.

1305
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:09,067
[shotgun cocks]

1306
01:19:09,767 --> 01:19:10,567
I'll take that.

1307
01:19:14,833 --> 01:19:15,667
And that.

1308
01:19:18,733 --> 01:19:20,367
Now, I'm afraid you two
are going to have to come

1309
01:19:20,467 --> 01:19:22,000
with me for a ride downtown.

1310
01:19:22,100 --> 01:19:22,900
Listen.

1311
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:23,833
Listen, Rogers.

1312
01:19:23,933 --> 01:19:25,267
Now, put the gun away.

1313
01:19:25,367 --> 01:19:26,733
Don't get all excited.
We're going to go to the car.

1314
01:19:26,833 --> 01:19:28,233
We're going to call my--

1315
01:19:28,333 --> 01:19:31,700
Now, you listen Miss Pompom
Queen of Nowheresville, USA.

1316
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:33,633
Shut the fuck up.

1317
01:19:33,733 --> 01:19:36,867
Do exactly as I say, or you're
going to find your heartbroken

1318
01:19:36,967 --> 01:19:38,300
for the last time.

1319
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:39,233
Let's go.

1320
01:19:52,967 --> 01:19:54,400
What are you
going to do with us?

1321
01:19:57,233 --> 01:19:58,667
You'll never get
away with this.

1322
01:19:58,767 --> 01:20:00,300
Oh, yes I will.

1323
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:01,767
Remember you two
have already drowned.

1324
01:20:05,833 --> 01:20:06,733
Open them.

1325
01:20:10,767 --> 01:20:13,900
Dillon always had a
thing for you, didn't he?

1326
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:15,367
What was it?

1327
01:20:15,467 --> 01:20:17,700
Maybe he just had a little
trouble paying his bills.

1328
01:20:21,133 --> 01:20:23,567
You know him better
than I thought.

1329
01:20:23,667 --> 01:20:25,200
Hey, look, tough guy.

1330
01:20:25,300 --> 01:20:27,867
When you left, someone
had to give him a hand.

1331
01:20:27,967 --> 01:20:29,400
We had a good deal.

1332
01:20:29,500 --> 01:20:32,100
I'd help him out with a little
confiscated stolen property,

1333
01:20:32,200 --> 01:20:34,400
and he'd cut up the pot.

1334
01:20:34,500 --> 01:20:36,600
And your two scumbag
partners would sell the stuff.

1335
01:20:36,700 --> 01:20:38,300
Isn't that just sweet?

1336
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:39,567
Yea.

1337
01:20:39,667 --> 01:20:40,933
It was a sweet deal all around
until your buddy decided

1338
01:20:41,033 --> 01:20:43,700
he didn't want to play anymore.

1339
01:20:43,800 --> 01:20:45,367
He was a chump.

1340
01:20:45,467 --> 01:20:48,433
He couldn't afford the
rent on that garage anyway.

1341
01:20:48,533 --> 01:20:49,667
See.

1342
01:20:49,767 --> 01:20:52,133
Me and my partners, we were
doing a friend a favor.

1343
01:20:52,233 --> 01:20:53,967
MARY: You fucking rat.

1344
01:20:54,067 --> 01:20:55,767
You're never going to
get away with this.

1345
01:20:55,867 --> 01:20:57,467
My father is going to catch on.

1346
01:20:57,567 --> 01:20:59,600
Shut up.

1347
01:20:59,700 --> 01:21:01,033
Both of you, shut up.

1348
01:21:01,133 --> 01:21:02,800
JESSIE: You're not just
going to shoot us and throw

1349
01:21:02,900 --> 01:21:04,300
us in the river, are you?

1350
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:06,100
I mean that would be a little
obvious if our bodies came

1351
01:21:06,200 --> 01:21:07,933
floating up with bullet
slugs that match your rifle,

1352
01:21:08,033 --> 01:21:09,067
don't you think?

1353
01:21:09,167 --> 01:21:10,633
Really doesn't
matter now, does it?

1354
01:21:10,733 --> 01:21:12,967
After all, I've been taking
potshots at you all day.

1355
01:21:13,067 --> 01:21:14,900
Maybe I connected.

1356
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:16,600
Both of us.

1357
01:21:16,700 --> 01:21:18,367
I doubt it.

1358
01:21:18,467 --> 01:21:20,433
You know, maybe you're right.

1359
01:21:20,533 --> 01:21:23,100
I just better play
it safe and make

1360
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:24,933
it look like a simple drowning.

1361
01:21:25,033 --> 01:21:25,833
Jessie.

1362
01:21:25,933 --> 01:21:27,433
My god.

1363
01:21:27,533 --> 01:21:28,433
Help!

1364
01:21:28,533 --> 01:21:31,400
[gunshots]

1365
01:21:36,500 --> 01:21:39,400
Johnny!

1366
01:21:39,500 --> 01:21:42,367
[crashing]

1367
01:21:42,967 --> 01:21:43,800
Johnny!

1368
01:22:21,767 --> 01:22:22,667
[thud]

1369
01:22:31,200 --> 01:22:32,233
Over there.

1370
01:22:32,333 --> 01:22:33,233
It looks like a
cabin or something.

1371
01:22:33,333 --> 01:22:34,133
Come on.

1372
01:22:36,567 --> 01:22:38,400
I'll go see if there's
any doors or windows open.

1373
01:22:38,500 --> 01:22:39,300
Fuck that.

1374
01:22:47,233 --> 01:22:48,600
What is this place?

1375
01:22:48,700 --> 01:22:50,033
It's Old Man Johnson's place.

1376
01:22:50,133 --> 01:22:51,733
He comes up here
hunting on the weekends.

1377
01:22:51,833 --> 01:22:53,833
He actually stays here?

1378
01:22:53,933 --> 01:22:55,500
Maybe he left a rifle up here.

1379
01:22:58,667 --> 01:22:59,467
Oh, baby.

1380
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:08,467
[gunshot]

1381
01:23:08,567 --> 01:23:09,767
- [scream] He saw me.
- All right.

1382
01:23:09,867 --> 01:23:10,733
Now, listen.

1383
01:23:10,833 --> 01:23:11,700
This is what you got to do.

1384
01:23:11,800 --> 01:23:13,000
You got to sneak out the back.

1385
01:23:13,100 --> 01:23:14,400
And get into town and
try and find some help.

1386
01:23:14,500 --> 01:23:15,533
I'm not leaving.

1387
01:23:15,633 --> 01:23:16,833
I'll lead this fucker
on and draw his fire.

1388
01:23:16,933 --> 01:23:17,967
I'm not leaving you.
I can't.

1389
01:23:18,067 --> 01:23:19,100
Yes, you will.
You have to.

1390
01:23:19,200 --> 01:23:20,300
It's the only way for both--
- No.

1391
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:21,100
Please.
- Come on, Mary.

1392
01:23:21,200 --> 01:23:22,033
You got to go.

1393
01:23:22,133 --> 01:23:23,567
Come on.
Come on.

1394
01:23:23,667 --> 01:23:24,733
Be careful.

1395
01:23:24,833 --> 01:23:25,667
Go.

1396
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:29,700

1397
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:31,667

1400
01:23:55,600 --> 01:23:56,567
Come on, you asshole.

1401
01:23:56,667 --> 01:23:57,567
Come on.

1402
01:23:57,667 --> 01:23:59,300
Come on, you son of a bitch.

1403
01:23:59,400 --> 01:24:00,267
[gunshot]

1404
01:24:08,100 --> 01:24:09,567
[gunshots]

1405
01:24:13,033 --> 01:24:15,233
You want to kill
me, motherfucker.

1406
01:24:15,333 --> 01:24:16,433
Come on.

1407
01:24:16,533 --> 01:24:17,367
Ugh.

1408
01:25:19,567 --> 01:25:24,933
[whimpering]

1409
01:25:25,033 --> 01:25:27,200

[sobbing]

1411
01:25:31,733 --> 01:25:34,033
Please.

1412
01:25:34,133 --> 01:25:35,200
Please don't hurt me.

1413
01:25:38,700 --> 01:25:39,600
No.

1414
01:25:39,700 --> 01:25:40,700
No.

1415
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:41,600
Please.

1416
01:26:01,333 --> 01:26:02,167
Ugh.

1417
01:26:08,667 --> 01:26:10,133
[thud]

1418
01:26:12,133 --> 01:26:13,833
FRANK: Oh my god, Mary.

1419
01:26:13,933 --> 01:26:14,800
Mary, are you all right?

1420
01:26:14,900 --> 01:26:15,733
I'll get her to the car.

1421
01:26:21,267 --> 01:26:22,933
What the hell
is going on here?

1422
01:26:23,033 --> 01:26:25,033
He tried to kill her.

1423
01:26:25,133 --> 01:26:27,767
He had her held up at
Old Man Johnson's place,

1424
01:26:27,867 --> 01:26:29,400
and he started firing.

1425
01:26:29,500 --> 01:26:31,867
But I got him.

1426
01:26:31,967 --> 01:26:34,467
My brother,
where's my brother?

1427
01:26:34,567 --> 01:26:37,667
Your brother's dead.

1428
01:26:37,767 --> 01:26:38,700
PAUL: Dead?

1429
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:39,633
Jessie?

1430
01:26:43,067 --> 01:26:47,000
Sheriff, don't you have
any control over your men?

1431
01:26:47,100 --> 01:26:48,733
My brother was
innocent, you bastard.

1432
01:26:56,100 --> 01:26:57,533
He's going to kill us.
Watch out!

1433
01:26:57,633 --> 01:26:58,467
Papa!

1434
01:27:00,833 --> 01:27:02,767
I should have figured
there was something wrong.

1435
01:27:06,200 --> 01:27:08,133
I had to kill him.

1436
01:27:08,233 --> 01:27:11,033
Now, I'm going to have to
take care of the rest of you.

1437
01:27:11,133 --> 01:27:12,633
[gunshot]

1438
01:27:12,733 --> 01:27:13,633
Ugh.

1439
01:27:13,733 --> 01:27:14,533
Papa!

1440
01:27:18,733 --> 01:27:20,200

1441
01:27:29,133 --> 01:27:30,200
