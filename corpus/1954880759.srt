1
00:03:35,182 --> 00:03:38,102
I must take the stone
to the Paladin.

2
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:42,482
I won't stop until
I reach the monastery.

3
00:03:42,566 --> 00:03:46,610
The Paladin will send the team their silver.
My path is sure.

4
00:03:47,236 --> 00:03:53,577
I have no fear. And the goddess says
that you are stay here for the time being.

5
00:03:57,122 --> 00:03:59,915
Trust the goddess always.

6
00:04:01,501 --> 00:04:04,169
To adventure.
- To riches and gold.

7
00:04:06,088 --> 00:04:10,092
Here's to you Marek.
And that nice piece of magic in the Ogre cave.

8
00:04:10,218 --> 00:04:13,722
Gojun would be upset disappointed in me.
- So, who's Gojun?

9
00:04:13,805 --> 00:04:15,306
A friend.

10
00:04:17,141 --> 00:04:19,435
Trust the goddess.

11
00:04:40,372 --> 00:04:42,751
Something is not right.

12
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:52,552
The stone.
He took the stone and the .

13
00:04:53,302 --> 00:04:57,222
He hunts
for the Darkspore.

14
00:05:12,072 --> 00:05:14,741
Farewell my sister.

15
00:05:35,095 --> 00:05:39,556
The Warrior Thane, I have
seen how you look at him.

16
00:05:40,599 --> 00:05:46,063
Make your choices with a clear heart
and trust the goddess always.

17
00:06:23,935 --> 00:06:25,811
He has had enough.

18
00:06:36,864 --> 00:06:41,118
Marek, join the fun.
- She has gone because of you.

19
00:06:43,037 --> 00:06:47,167
It is the drink talking.
- Get off of me, you cripple punk.

20
00:06:48,292 --> 00:06:50,628
Leave me alone. Leave me.

21
00:06:51,837 --> 00:06:55,007
Drunken fuck.
- Go away.

22
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:57,009
Marek, no...

23
00:07:02,306 --> 00:07:04,309
More.

24
00:07:22,117 --> 00:07:24,245
Hello, Dagen.

25
00:08:52,541 --> 00:08:56,629
Necromancer, your
darkness strengthens.

26
00:08:56,713 --> 00:08:59,883
It draws you to me.
Marek.

27
00:08:59,966 --> 00:09:03,051
I've been waiting so long time ...

28
00:09:03,136 --> 00:09:06,597
let me free you from your pain.

29
00:09:06,847 --> 00:09:11,686
I can make you whole forever.

30
00:09:11,768 --> 00:09:14,898
Marek. I know you. I ...

31
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:06,908
Gojun.

32
00:10:11,829 --> 00:10:14,039
Quietly.

33
00:10:33,351 --> 00:10:36,436
You peered into the darkness.

34
00:10:36,521 --> 00:10:40,108
And has peered back.
I was foolish.

35
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:44,152
Forces drew us together,
but I did not see it.

36
00:10:44,236 --> 00:10:48,283
I was not looking for one so young.
Or a woman.

37
00:10:48,407 --> 00:10:52,035
I'm sorry.
- What is this all about, Gojun?

38
00:10:53,996 --> 00:10:57,916
You're a necromancer.
- Necromancer?

39
00:10:59,294 --> 00:11:03,130
First one I've in a very long time.

40
00:11:03,463 --> 00:11:05,966
I searched and I wandered.

41
00:11:06,551 --> 00:11:11,179
But then I grew wiry of searching,
so I turned into it, into a sleep of my own.

42
00:11:14,309 --> 00:11:16,727
He has found you.

43
00:11:19,438 --> 00:11:22,775
I had a dream, a figure ...

44
00:11:24,819 --> 00:11:26,570
He knew me.

45
00:11:27,821 --> 00:11:29,324
Szorlok.

46
00:11:31,326 --> 00:11:34,537
He's the darkest of the necromancers.

47
00:11:34,661 --> 00:11:39,042
80 years ago the Vitalian army
was at Deira's doorstep ...

48
00:11:39,207 --> 00:11:45,172
Santri Senturi Impes octrus Urum.

49
00:12:20,332 --> 00:12:24,503
Behold the Darkspore.

50
00:12:24,629 --> 00:12:27,714
Santri Senturi Impes octrus Urum.

51
00:12:32,219 --> 00:12:36,848
Worship me as I reforge
the heart of the Lich King.

52
00:12:47,984 --> 00:12:52,615
And now you will fulfill your
true purpose in this ceremony.

53
00:13:14,302 --> 00:13:21,059
Lich king, for a thousand years
your power will rival the gods.

54
00:13:34,991 --> 00:13:39,744
Szorlok, in the names of all the gods,
I command you to stop.

55
00:14:06,104 --> 00:14:08,149
No.

56
00:14:11,568 --> 00:14:15,698
Take the Darkspore,
we will hold him.

57
00:14:24,247 --> 00:14:30,170
Gojun the betrayer.
The black heart beats again.

58
00:14:30,546 --> 00:14:33,757
The Darkspore is mine.

59
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:51,294
in the wind.

60
00:15:56,464 --> 00:16:00,010
Through the four corners of the land.

61
00:16:00,218 --> 00:16:03,431
Leave no trace of your passing.

62
00:16:09,228 --> 00:16:14,817
Man has not known a power,
that he does not crave.

63
00:16:15,317 --> 00:16:19,529
Those that are bounded by darkness
will do anything ...

64
00:16:19,697 --> 00:16:21,781
to keep their power.

65
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:29,114
The Darkspore is all that
stands against Szorlok.

66
00:16:29,831 --> 00:16:35,546
If those shards ever get put together,
there'll be no way to stop him.

67
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:38,841
Near that power, even win death.

68
00:16:40,008 --> 00:16:43,054
What these have to do with me?

69
00:16:44,179 --> 00:16:49,018
You are a necromancer. Your
darkness is something he seeks.

70
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:53,063
Well, I won't be controlled.

71
00:16:55,441 --> 00:16:58,485
Yes, perhaps.

72
00:16:59,362 --> 00:17:04,032
But the lure of power draws in
the wisest men to their doom.

73
00:17:06,117 --> 00:17:11,123
Szorlok was much like you once.
- I'm not like him. I am not evil.

74
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:18,881
You borrow life for selfish
gain. Is that not evil?

75
00:17:20,466 --> 00:17:22,258
I am not evil.

76
00:17:23,511 --> 00:17:27,514
Evil runs in the blood of all men.

77
00:17:27,597 --> 00:17:33,311
You are untested and one day you will be
forced to choose. You have potential Marek.

78
00:17:33,395 --> 00:17:36,774
For real good and for real evil.

79
00:17:37,565 --> 00:17:41,696
But you need to learn to control your power,
or that choice will be made for you.

80
00:17:41,778 --> 00:17:46,492
How can I control something I don't
even understand? I'm alone in this.

81
00:17:46,575 --> 00:17:49,369
I will teach you.

82
00:17:51,163 --> 00:17:53,082
But you must be wary.

83
00:17:53,164 --> 00:17:57,670
When you delve into the void,
there is others who can sense you.

84
00:17:58,461 --> 00:18:02,924
That is why Szorlok is poisoning your dreams
and that is why Kishkumen was able to find you.

85
00:18:03,007 --> 00:18:04,760
The man with the yellow eyes?

86
00:18:08,723 --> 00:18:13,561
I took Kishkumen to Caeryn.
- The darkness has come.

87
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:17,981
And the world has need of heroes.

88
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:27,658
For now you must stay here.
I will return in a few days.

89
00:18:59,689 --> 00:19:02,901
?apeta, well fetch me
something to write with.

90
00:19:11,202 --> 00:19:14,537
A message from your friend.

91
00:19:19,001 --> 00:19:22,128
Get Marek and come to my room.

92
00:19:23,713 --> 00:19:27,258
Put those over there.

93
00:19:27,342 --> 00:19:32,180
No, no, no. This one goes there.
And that one goes there. Understood?

94
00:19:50,782 --> 00:19:53,452
Hello, Marek.

95
00:19:55,538 --> 00:20:00,042
I have found you.
Dagen's looking for you.

96
00:20:04,712 --> 00:20:05,964
Come on.

97
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:20,521
I am going to bed.
- Patience, Thane.

98
00:20:21,271 --> 00:20:25,442
It takes time to rebuilt
that which was broke.

99
00:20:25,525 --> 00:20:28,236
Right. Of course.

100
00:20:34,367 --> 00:20:37,036
Just a little attention here.

101
00:20:39,081 --> 00:20:43,919
Yes, and she should keep it quite up.

102
00:20:51,259 --> 00:20:54,972
What is it?
- I'm not sure.

103
00:20:56,265 --> 00:20:59,268
But Kishkumen has one just like it.

104
00:21:01,352 --> 00:21:03,313
Dagen, we're in trouble.
- What?

105
00:21:03,354 --> 00:21:05,607
Give me some ink.

106
00:21:22,498 --> 00:21:26,836
Is it a cypher?
Some kind of code maybe?

107
00:21:27,754 --> 00:21:30,257
No, it's a map.

108
00:21:33,427 --> 00:21:35,219
Mondiatha.

109
00:21:37,056 --> 00:21:39,642
What's Mondiatha?
- An ancient city of giants.

110
00:21:39,724 --> 00:21:44,020
It's destroyed now, but it's only
the biggest treasure trove out there.

111
00:21:44,104 --> 00:21:50,151
The Darkspore is Mondiatha. We have
to get there before Kishkumen does. - The Darkspore.

112
00:21:50,234 --> 00:21:51,778
Am I missing something?

113
00:21:51,861 --> 00:21:55,866
It seeps city and heart of the Lich King.
Broken into four pieces.

114
00:21:55,950 --> 00:22:00,662
Caeryn took the first piece from the temple.
It's what Kishkumen was after.

115
00:22:00,746 --> 00:22:05,292
The second piece is in Mondiatha.
- What's it worth?

116
00:22:05,376 --> 00:22:09,379
If reforged, an army
can become invincible.

117
00:22:09,462 --> 00:22:12,048
Limitless power, death, destruction.

118
00:22:12,132 --> 00:22:13,591
I see why he's interested.

119
00:22:13,675 --> 00:22:17,470
With any luck this
map shows the entrance.

120
00:22:17,553 --> 00:22:20,765
Whatever it is, we know
where he's going be.

121
00:22:20,848 --> 00:22:24,769
We can avenge Caeryn's death.
- I promised Gojun Pye I'd stay.

122
00:22:24,853 --> 00:22:29,108
That old blow on. Is he even
aware of recent developments?

123
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:32,653
Kishkumen has a half day on
us back. We owe this to Teela.

124
00:22:32,736 --> 00:22:38,324
We owe this to Teela? Well last
I checked Teela's goddess owes us.

125
00:22:38,658 --> 00:22:40,202
However ...

126
00:22:41,369 --> 00:22:45,457
A hidden treasure of legendary
proportions, unguarded ...

127
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:49,878
and there for the taking. I could ...
I mean ... We all could be rich.

128
00:22:49,962 --> 00:22:52,172
Fuck the treasure.
- Fuck the treasure? Look ...

129
00:22:52,256 --> 00:22:54,298
I didn't have to share this with you. Ok?

130
00:22:54,382 --> 00:22:57,844
I could very easily have
just taken this and ...

131
00:22:58,177 --> 00:23:04,017
Marek, you could get your
face off of those posters.

132
00:23:04,392 --> 00:23:08,856
And Thane ...
Well Thane, you could save the world.

133
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:13,360
We leave today.

134
00:23:14,695 --> 00:23:17,780
With Teela.
- With Teela? Good luck with that.

135
00:23:17,865 --> 00:23:21,535
She isn't speaking to anyone for 14 days.
Part of an essence, mourning rites.

136
00:23:21,617 --> 00:23:23,704
I find her.
- Send this one.

137
00:23:23,787 --> 00:23:29,792
He need the work out, some of those angers.
You and I can get my silver's worth of the bed.

138
00:23:29,876 --> 00:23:33,379
Paid forth to the noon.
What time is it?

139
00:23:33,463 --> 00:23:35,257
Noon.

140
00:23:38,259 --> 00:23:42,014
Tell Teela we all
mourn with her.

141
00:23:53,524 --> 00:23:57,571
Have a fruit. Noon?

142
00:24:02,408 --> 00:24:08,957
Your slave girl with the deformed foot.
I like to purchase her from you.

143
00:24:10,584 --> 00:24:15,004
She ran.
I put a bounty on her head.

144
00:24:15,088 --> 00:24:20,843
Yes. Bounties are high.
She's worth what? 500?

145
00:24:21,345 --> 00:24:24,514
600 on the market?

146
00:24:25,098 --> 00:24:29,478
What would a pimp like you
want with a crippled girl?

147
00:24:29,561 --> 00:24:34,524
Let's just say she's errr ...
left an impression on me.

148
00:24:34,899 --> 00:24:36,609
Make an offer?

149
00:24:43,324 --> 00:24:46,911
200 gold. In your pocket right now.

150
00:24:49,748 --> 00:24:54,878
And you let my girls and
my purse to track her down.

151
00:25:10,477 --> 00:25:14,355
I' ll be greatful to be rid of the kniving bitch.

152
00:25:16,315 --> 00:25:19,278
Good. Leave.

153
00:25:21,112 --> 00:25:23,114
Leave.

154
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:34,458
I want her back, alive and unharmed.

155
00:26:03,989 --> 00:26:08,160
Teela, Teela I know you
still mourning, but ...

156
00:26:11,121 --> 00:26:13,290
Teela, Kishkumen murdered Caeryn ...

157
00:26:13,373 --> 00:26:17,628
because he's going to unite the
Darkspore. I need to stop him.

158
00:26:19,504 --> 00:26:21,339
Come with me.

159
00:26:22,381 --> 00:26:24,176
Who are you, Marek?

160
00:26:24,926 --> 00:26:28,347
Why do you seek
such dark magic?

161
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:32,808
You can use the same dark
power which killed my sister.

162
00:26:33,268 --> 00:26:36,646
It is a power that I do not understand.
- Or control.

163
00:26:36,855 --> 00:26:40,025
You were marked by evil for
all to see.

164
00:26:40,108 --> 00:26:43,237
Your foot is twisted
and cannot be healed.

165
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:48,575
You seek dangers surrounded by evil,
yet you say you wish to be good.

166
00:26:48,658 --> 00:26:54,497
You have no power over the
darkness inside you. It calls you.

167
00:26:54,957 --> 00:26:59,752
And in time it will claim you.
It is your fate.

168
00:27:01,337 --> 00:27:06,093
I'm sorry about Caeryn.
- I will come with you.

169
00:27:06,385 --> 00:27:11,932
And I will report to you. And I will
deliver the Darkspore to the Paladin..

170
00:27:12,015 --> 00:27:14,767
He will know how best to hide it.

171
00:27:40,084 --> 00:27:42,378
Declare yourself.

172
00:27:44,172 --> 00:27:46,632
Declare yourself.

173
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:50,928
Attack.

174
00:28:07,654 --> 00:28:10,907
Go to Mineas. Get reinforcements.
Make haste.

175
00:28:11,115 --> 00:28:13,160
Hold them off.

176
00:29:52,591 --> 00:29:55,511
Did I ever tell you about those ten
giants and their incredibly large...

177
00:29:55,594 --> 00:29:59,098
Yes, several times. Yeah.
- Marek hasn't heard, have you.

178
00:29:59,181 --> 00:30:03,352
The one where you awoke the dragon?
- Oh, yes.

179
00:30:16,365 --> 00:30:18,242
What's that sound?

180
00:30:26,792 --> 00:30:32,174
It's Elvish.
- No, doesn't sound like any Elvish that I ever heard.

181
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:33,707
Someone is in trouble.

182
00:30:35,885 --> 00:30:37,845
Let's go have a look.

183
00:30:38,305 --> 00:30:41,807
Get off me. Get off.

184
00:30:49,899 --> 00:30:53,486
Fairies.
- Nasty little fuckers.

185
00:30:54,529 --> 00:30:57,782
They're going cook 'm and eat 'm.
- We're going to aid him.

186
00:30:57,866 --> 00:31:02,078
We do not even know who he is.
- Teela, go find some marmot seed.

187
00:31:02,328 --> 00:31:08,627
Dagen, Thane, with me?
- You're on your own on this one sweetheart.

188
00:31:34,361 --> 00:31:38,865
Alright, here we go.
Let's get them with power.

189
00:31:38,949 --> 00:31:41,826
How many of those little fuck ...
Damn.

190
00:31:58,468 --> 00:32:02,137
Dagen.
- Dagen, get in here.

191
00:32:09,603 --> 00:32:13,024
I have marmot seed.
- Dagen, you've got a plan ...

192
00:32:13,108 --> 00:32:19,363
If I get eaten by a pixie, tell
them it was a dragon or something.

193
00:32:19,573 --> 00:32:20,615
Dagen.

194
00:32:29,206 --> 00:32:31,960
What is it you going do, nasty bagger?

195
00:32:42,095 --> 00:32:45,389
Come on, they won't
stay this way for long.

196
00:32:52,938 --> 00:32:55,984
Let's get them out of
here before they wake up.

197
00:33:23,428 --> 00:33:26,931
Have you seen a man with yellow
eyes, Dark Elf?

198
00:33:27,265 --> 00:33:30,601
I am of the Garun-Dan.
- Fuck you all.

199
00:33:33,146 --> 00:33:36,231
What would you know, half-breed?
- Dagen.

200
00:33:45,407 --> 00:33:48,703
The Garun-Dan were destroyed and
didn't mark their faces ...

201
00:33:48,787 --> 00:33:54,166
like savages from the north.
You are not Garun-Dan.

202
00:33:55,210 --> 00:33:57,628
What's his stand? Lifting rocks all day?

203
00:33:57,711 --> 00:34:00,631
We going to the ruins of Mondiatha.
- Don't fyking tell him the mission.

204
00:34:00,715 --> 00:34:03,884
There is a Golgotian with yellow eyes
who commands a horde of Orks.

205
00:34:03,968 --> 00:34:08,097
His name is Kishkumen.
Do you know of him?

206
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:12,351
He is too stupid to even understand your
questions, even if he wanted to answer them..

207
00:34:12,811 --> 00:34:15,730
I am cursed by the gods.
I must wander this world ...

208
00:34:15,814 --> 00:34:19,483
till I have performed a
task that appeases them.

209
00:34:19,734 --> 00:34:22,361
How long have you wandered?
- Ten migrations of the Elch.

210
00:34:22,444 --> 00:34:24,239
Alone?
- Thane.

211
00:34:24,321 --> 00:34:28,118
Don't lie to us, long-ears .
- I speak the truth.

212
00:34:29,993 --> 00:34:31,870
There is no honour in lying.

213
00:34:40,921 --> 00:34:44,092
You saved my life.
I owe you a life-dept.

214
00:34:40,827 --> 00:34:42,625
I'm bound to you until
that dept's been repaid.

215
00:34:44,174 --> 00:34:47,345
Just what every girl wants.

216
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:49,671
He's lying by the way.

217
00:34:50,515 --> 00:34:53,058
He is a Druchii and they lie, lie

218
00:34:53,852 --> 00:34:56,562
Probably planning on slitting
our throats tonight ...

219
00:34:56,645 --> 00:35:00,358
and painting pictures
of it all over his face.

220
00:35:01,651 --> 00:35:03,485
You believe him

221
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:07,948
I am telling you:
He is pure evil.

222
00:35:08,031 --> 00:35:11,326
Good and evil cross in the heart
of every living creature.

223
00:35:11,411 --> 00:35:14,414
Of course not. What tryke.

224
00:35:20,669 --> 00:35:25,007
Are you sure about this?
- We could use the help.

225
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:34,016
What is your name?
- Qole.

226
00:35:34,641 --> 00:35:37,895
Qole, you don't owe me anything.

227
00:35:37,343 --> 00:35:41,431
I've been a slave and I will
not accept slavery in anything.

228
00:35:42,984 --> 00:35:48,113
But you're more than welcome to join with us.
For free. Of your oath.

229
00:35:51,159 --> 00:35:53,619
Alright, let's give him a shirt.

230
00:35:59,374 --> 00:36:04,088
The Dark Elf dies a bloody, bloody death

231
00:36:10,469 --> 00:36:15,934
Right there in the middle,
that is where my pile of gold is.

232
00:36:18,228 --> 00:36:21,105
Our pile of gold.

233
00:36:24,734 --> 00:36:28,695
Something new?
- The shell of the Cockatrice.

234
00:36:30,614 --> 00:36:35,328
When used with the right spell
can turn flesh to stone.

235
00:36:35,411 --> 00:36:39,582
I knew a woman from Valencia
with that same power.

236
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:48,132
Right.

237
00:37:00,561 --> 00:37:04,857
Right. What do you suppose this is?

238
00:37:12,739 --> 00:37:16,577
A powerful healing potion.
- Didn't ask you Qole.

239
00:37:16,661 --> 00:37:19,747
I was hoping for an aphrodisiac.
- Where did you get that?

240
00:37:19,830 --> 00:37:25,627
The Oger Cave. Probably
part of the temple stash.

241
00:37:29,090 --> 00:37:32,969
I might go see where
Thane and Teela are.

242
00:37:33,961 --> 00:37:35,671
If you excuse me.

243
00:37:38,682 --> 00:37:41,144
I should clearly go.

244
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:47,692
Right. Harm a hair on her
head and I will find you.

245
00:37:49,484 --> 00:37:54,490
The crow's plucked out
his bonny, bonny eye.

246
00:38:10,339 --> 00:38:12,800
Why do you stare me that way?

247
00:38:17,846 --> 00:38:20,183
It pleases me.

248
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:35,605
An amulet. A legend of my people.

249
00:38:37,658 --> 00:38:41,161
The sun follows moon until she slows ...

250
00:38:41,787 --> 00:38:46,501
he lays next to her in the sky.
Before they part ...

251
00:38:47,919 --> 00:38:53,215
he draws the stars from her
and cast them into the night ...

252
00:38:55,009 --> 00:38:57,886
telling everyone of their love.

253
00:38:59,388 --> 00:39:01,431
It means a lot to you.

254
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:09,315
It was a gift from a woman.

255
00:39:20,451 --> 00:39:24,788
My people are no more.
They were slaughtered.

256
00:39:27,708 --> 00:39:30,169
I am the last one.

257
00:39:30,878 --> 00:39:34,923
So are your faces marked?
In remembrance?

258
00:39:37,677 --> 00:39:40,555
I was raised by a shaman.

259
00:39:40,804 --> 00:39:45,976
He gave me the markings to
protect me from dark powers.

260
00:39:59,782 --> 00:40:01,867
Goodnight, Marek.

261
00:40:30,312 --> 00:40:35,568
Thank you for keeping watch.
- This daily bathing is unsafe.

262
00:40:36,109 --> 00:40:38,737
The goddess demands it.

263
00:40:45,243 --> 00:40:47,413
Keep talking.
- About what?

264
00:40:47,537 --> 00:40:53,335
Tell me of your childhood.
- There's nothing to tell there.

265
00:40:53,418 --> 00:40:55,129
Please.

266
00:40:57,339 --> 00:41:00,009
My father was a soldier.

267
00:41:00,093 --> 00:41:04,721
I think I'd seen him twice
before we got word he'd been killed.

268
00:41:04,889 --> 00:41:07,390
We were put on the streets.

269
00:41:07,767 --> 00:41:11,186
I join the army, got to
march across the world ...

270
00:41:11,269 --> 00:41:15,232
ended up here,
long way from Maneas.

271
00:41:14,681 --> 00:41:16,432
Are you from Maneas?

272
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:21,531
Is the capital very grand?
- I wouldn't say that.

273
00:41:22,532 --> 00:41:27,577
Filth and shit, beggars.
There's grand buildings, alright.

274
00:41:27,911 --> 00:41:32,374
People grinding up on that (?)
they piss on you on the street.

275
00:41:33,333 --> 00:41:37,295
Is that how you imagine it?
- More beautiful.

276
00:41:37,463 --> 00:41:39,757
There are parts.

277
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:45,428
When the sun goes down,
the city starts to glow ...

278
00:41:45,295 --> 00:41:47,671
you can hear music.

279
00:41:49,349 --> 00:41:51,727
You hear people laugh and sing.

280
00:41:54,271 --> 00:41:57,190
And love.

281
00:42:10,203 --> 00:42:11,788
Thane.

282
00:42:29,389 --> 00:42:34,395
Sorry.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

283
00:42:35,438 --> 00:42:40,568
It is so hard to find a moment
of privacy in this woods.

284
00:42:41,194 --> 00:42:45,322
Put the sword away, you
won't be needing it tonight.

285
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:50,596
Dagen. Get up.

286
00:43:59,854 --> 00:44:02,107
Qole, my sword.

287
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:07,737
Can someone hand me my sword?

288
00:44:14,911 --> 00:44:17,331
Damn it.
- Good shot.

289
00:44:17,665 --> 00:44:21,585
We've come for Marek.
The rest of you are free to leave.

290
00:44:21,668 --> 00:44:25,213
You have to kill us first.
- Hang on.

291
00:44:31,845 --> 00:44:34,389
Gods. They are magnificent.

292
00:44:38,643 --> 00:44:43,024
And she's good at the rope.
- Any of you bastards try to follow us ...

293
00:44:42,471 --> 00:44:46,935
and I'll slit her throat all the
way her spine. You understood?

294
00:44:48,069 --> 00:44:50,406
Aphrodisiac.

295
00:44:51,906 --> 00:44:54,492
Damn.
- Marek.

296
00:44:54,951 --> 00:44:58,788
Marek. Marek.

297
00:45:00,833 --> 00:45:02,793
Who are you and what do you want with me?

298
00:45:02,877 --> 00:45:06,172
Your new master wants to meet you.

299
00:45:07,715 --> 00:45:12,928
And with the trouble you've been,
I intend to collect in full.

300
00:45:12,377 --> 00:45:14,671
Tuen and Samoc scintilos.

301
00:45:23,105 --> 00:45:26,317
There're men in the woods.
No Deirans, they have horses.

302
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:29,069
Tuen and Samoc scintilos.

303
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:56,128
What did I tell you? Not Deirans.
- Why are Orks marching with men?

304
00:45:59,183 --> 00:46:01,811
Hey, over here.

305
00:46:13,613 --> 00:46:16,492
We will find you.

306
00:46:27,335 --> 00:46:28,796
Marek.

307
00:46:30,922 --> 00:46:33,800
You freed youselves.

308
00:46:36,679 --> 00:46:40,932
I wouldn't be much of a thief if a few
bunch of rope could keep me captive.

309
00:46:41,225 --> 00:46:45,020
Qole freed us using Teela's dagger.
- Where are the bounty hunters?

310
00:46:45,104 --> 00:46:47,522
We run into a horde
of Kishkumen's men.

311
00:46:47,606 --> 00:46:50,526
They headed north,
towards Mondiatha.

312
00:46:50,609 --> 00:46:55,029
And you recognized him only by
his eyes or was there more?

313
00:46:57,116 --> 00:46:59,534
We must move quickly
if we are to catch them.

314
00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:02,997
It's two days march to the ruin.
With no rest we can get 6 hours on them.

315
00:47:03,079 --> 00:47:06,749
That is not enough time to get
treasure out from a buried city.

316
00:47:06,834 --> 00:47:10,545
Not even for me.
- Or to retrieve the Darkspore.

317
00:47:10,628 --> 00:47:14,425
There is another way,
straight between the mountains.

318
00:47:14,507 --> 00:47:17,719
The Donkerbos Pass.
- How far?

319
00:47:18,094 --> 00:47:20,388
Twelve hours if we keep good pace.

320
00:47:20,473 --> 00:47:25,852
The pass goes through the Night Spings
which home to bog wights.

321
00:47:26,644 --> 00:47:29,273
Do I need to ask?
- No.

322
00:47:29,481 --> 00:47:32,943
Stories told to frighten children.

323
00:47:33,026 --> 00:47:37,280
If we meet up with Kishkumen and
his horde in a straight battle...

324
00:47:37,363 --> 00:47:39,908
we'll lose.

325
00:47:39,992 --> 00:47:42,494
Anisette wills it. The path is sure.

326
00:47:42,577 --> 00:47:45,788
I vote we take our chances
going the long way around.

327
00:47:45,956 --> 00:47:49,793
Alright. All in favor of the shortcut?

328
00:47:55,507 --> 00:47:57,425
This was your idea.

329
00:47:59,220 --> 00:48:01,597
Yes, but it is not a good idea.

330
00:48:18,531 --> 00:48:22,283
I'll go. I'm not going
raise my hand for it.

331
00:48:55,775 --> 00:48:59,572
This was a terrible, terrible idea.

332
00:48:59,654 --> 00:49:02,532
I thought you said wights were
just stories to frighten children?

333
00:49:02,615 --> 00:49:05,118
Take my word I'm terrified.

334
00:50:11,893 --> 00:50:14,313
We are being watched.

335
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:22,488
More than watched.

336
00:50:25,074 --> 00:50:27,200
We're being followed.

337
00:53:09,362 --> 00:53:13,950
Anisette, hear my prayer.
- Too late for Anisette's helping (?).

338
00:53:22,751 --> 00:53:23,918
No.

339
00:53:26,295 --> 00:53:29,215
What  way to end it.

340
00:54:23,437 --> 00:54:26,231
You are mine.

341
00:54:30,485 --> 00:54:33,864
Marek, release him.

342
00:54:34,864 --> 00:54:37,367
Release.

343
00:54:43,748 --> 00:54:46,250
Release it.

344
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:51,858
Teela, he needs your help.

345
00:55:52,943 --> 00:55:58,073
I can not do anything ...
I can not feel my fingers.

346
00:55:58,448 --> 00:56:01,368
He knows we are here, doesn't he?
- Who?

347
00:56:01,450 --> 00:56:02,743
Kishkumen.

348
00:56:05,497 --> 00:56:07,249
How?

349
00:56:09,250 --> 00:56:13,046
You did this. You make it right.
Can't shoot my fucking bow.

350
00:56:13,130 --> 00:56:14,797
Just tell them Marek.

351
00:56:16,591 --> 00:56:19,468
He can sense it.

352
00:56:19,553 --> 00:56:22,304
When I use it, the magic ...

353
00:56:21,753 --> 00:56:25,049
he can sense it, we're both necromancers.

354
00:56:25,767 --> 00:56:30,939
So in the Ogre cave it just ...
- I used your life force.

355
00:56:33,024 --> 00:56:36,027
You should have told us.
- I can control it.

356
00:56:36,111 --> 00:56:38,029
Just tell them the truth.
- I can control it.

357
00:56:38,571 --> 00:56:44,493
I won't use it again.
- I can't heal him. Your dark magic is too strong.

358
00:56:44,661 --> 00:56:48,080
I should never 've joined you.

359
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:51,625
I saved your lives.

360
00:56:53,294 --> 00:56:56,797
Well a lot of good it did my hand.

361
00:56:57,340 --> 00:57:02,011
Just admit it Marek. It's
inside you you can't control it.

362
00:57:02,303 --> 00:57:04,139
I saved your life.

363
00:57:04,222 --> 00:57:09,102
Maybe instead of saving it you
could stop sucking it out of me.

364
00:57:14,690 --> 00:57:17,943
Hold. Dagen. Dagen.

365
00:57:23,574 --> 00:57:25,201
Hey ...

366
00:57:26,786 --> 00:57:28,996
Hey ...

367
00:57:44,637 --> 00:57:49,308
Fucking Druchii. Would like
his woman dark and damaged.

368
00:57:54,105 --> 00:57:57,024
Enough. We don't have time for this.

369
00:57:59,026 --> 00:58:00,945
We need to move.

370
00:58:04,281 --> 00:58:05,449
Hey.

371
00:58:07,994 --> 00:58:11,498
Teela, we need to move.

372
00:58:59,129 --> 00:59:03,341
We need to rest.
- There isn't time.

373
00:59:44,883 --> 00:59:46,675
You have saved them.

374
00:59:48,427 --> 00:59:50,387
I would have killed them.

375
00:59:53,849 --> 00:59:55,559
They hate me.

376
00:59:56,937 --> 00:59:59,272
They fear you.

377
00:60:00,105 --> 00:60:03,359
Very few resisted once they have tasted it ...

378
00:60:03,443 --> 00:60:06,112
and it grows easier to call upon each time.

379
00:60:06,196 --> 00:60:10,951
What was I supposed to do?
We would have died.

380
00:60:12,493 --> 00:60:14,579
There is always another way.

381
00:60:19,542 --> 00:60:24,339
No one's future is written.
That is a lie by the gods.

382
00:60:26,131 --> 00:60:30,136
You're strong. You may choose.

383
01:01:32,197 --> 01:01:34,533
Hard to believe this was once a great city.

384
01:01:34,617 --> 01:01:38,787
They thought amazing enough treasure
would lure their god down from heavens.

385
01:01:38,872 --> 01:01:43,043
Instead, the earth turned to
dust and swallowed them hole.

386
01:01:43,501 --> 01:01:48,547
Yeah. The mistake they made was hoarding
the treasure instead of spending it.

387
01:01:48,881 --> 01:01:53,261
The entrance is west to the
ruins. Let's keep moving.

388
01:02:18,077 --> 01:02:21,581
Is this it?
- Maybe it's a portal.

389
01:02:21,790 --> 01:02:27,003
Maybe it's rocks in the sand.
- That looks Sathuan.

390
01:02:27,087 --> 01:02:30,298
I learned something  as a child.

391
01:02:39,808 --> 01:02:42,851
This is the Wandering Path.

392
01:02:44,728 --> 01:02:49,400
And the others must be the four
elements that Mondiathans worshiped.

393
01:02:49,608 --> 01:02:54,530
The marks are on the map but there is no
activation rune, there is no spell to open it.

394
01:03:05,834 --> 01:03:08,210
God, he is a strange one.

395
01:03:17,262 --> 01:03:21,766
This symbol, over the arcway.
It's here on the map.

396
01:03:22,392 --> 01:03:25,477
It's not a pictograph, nothing I recognise.

397
01:03:25,561 --> 01:03:30,649
There's five points and five stones.

398
01:03:34,570 --> 01:03:40,660
Marek, I need to speak with you.
- We're so close to the end Teela.

399
01:03:40,826 --> 01:03:43,787
We'll talk on the way home,
after we have the stone.

400
01:03:43,872 --> 01:03:47,750
I need to say it now.
- Then say it.

401
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:51,754
You've said it a hundred silent
ways already.

402
01:03:52,088 --> 01:03:54,883
That you blame for Caeryn's death.
- That was not what I was going to say.

403
01:03:54,966 --> 01:03:57,552
It's true. And you're right.

404
01:03:59,344 --> 01:04:03,557
I'm a necromancer and I can't control it.

405
01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:09,062
And if the Darkspore is in there
and I touch it, Kishkumen will see.

406
01:04:09,146 --> 01:04:13,109
Look, there's something drawing me
towards it and it's growing stronger.

407
01:04:13,193 --> 01:04:15,986
I do not know if I can resist it.

408
01:04:16,070 --> 01:04:19,657
We have come all this way.
- I'm not going in with you.

409
01:04:19,741 --> 01:04:21,701
You have to keep it from me.

410
01:04:21,783 --> 01:04:26,164
With the Darkspore,I could
destroy as all.

411
01:05:45,326 --> 01:05:48,621
You know, I'll say this for
your priestess.

412
01:05:49,288 --> 01:05:54,335
Once you've seen her without the dress
it's difficult to imagine her any other way.

413
01:05:56,004 --> 01:05:57,796
I'm sorry Thane..

414
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:18,192
Stop.

415
01:06:18,776 --> 01:06:23,406
Qole, a little help please.
- The Wanderpath.

416
01:06:24,282 --> 01:06:26,993
Gosh, is it that simple?

417
01:06:33,582 --> 01:06:35,542
Qole.
- Get off me.

418
01:06:39,463 --> 01:06:43,050
It's that simple. So simple.

419
01:06:44,844 --> 01:06:50,182
She's done in. She finally lost it.
The last bit of her sense.

420
01:07:09,577 --> 01:07:12,246
The portal is open.

421
01:07:54,163 --> 01:07:58,042
It is the yellow-eyed necromancer.
He sensed you're here.

422
01:07:59,460 --> 01:08:02,212
Well done, Marek.

423
01:08:02,672 --> 01:08:08,511
Always a step ahead or a step behind. We're
never far from each other path, are we?

424
01:08:09,302 --> 01:08:14,224
My master has seen you in the
dark, Marek the slave girl.

425
01:08:15,601 --> 01:08:18,103
But you don't know who you are, do you?

426
01:08:20,439 --> 01:08:23,650
Szorlok has a great purpose for you.

427
01:08:26,862 --> 01:08:29,323
Drop your weapons.

428
01:08:32,033 --> 01:08:37,914
In time he will show who you
are and what you may become.

429
01:08:38,540 --> 01:08:41,835
But now you will save me the
trouble of collecting the stone.

430
01:08:43,420 --> 01:08:46,173
We will not serve Szorlok.

431
01:08:46,257 --> 01:08:50,511
Yes you will. Whether in life or death.

432
01:08:51,052 --> 01:08:53,723
As your sister did.

433
01:08:59,394 --> 01:09:03,149
Necromancer, you will retrieve the
stone and you will deliver it to me.

434
01:09:03,232 --> 01:09:06,276
Or your friend will die.
- No, Marek.

435
01:09:07,153 --> 01:09:11,073
No love for the priestess'
sister. I see. Very well.

436
01:09:11,156 --> 01:09:12,992
I'll go.
- But Marek ...

437
01:09:13,074 --> 01:09:17,662
I don't have a choice.
- Then we go together.

438
01:09:17,746 --> 01:09:20,916
Marek, you'll be lost.

439
01:09:21,574 --> 01:09:23,994
And should any doubt arise ...

440
01:09:26,463 --> 01:09:29,132
No, no.
- Marek.

441
01:09:29,716 --> 01:09:34,847
The poison I've infected her with will
fester, causing exquisite pain ...

442
01:09:34,930 --> 01:09:37,599
till it reaches her heart.

443
01:09:37,683 --> 01:09:41,686
I will drow it from her should
you return with the stone.

444
01:09:41,770 --> 01:09:46,776
You have about two hours. I suggest
you make your decision quickly.

445
01:09:46,859 --> 01:09:48,820
We have to go now.

446
01:09:48,902 --> 01:09:51,863
We'll go. We'll go.

447
01:09:56,577 --> 01:09:58,871
Come on, Dagen.

448
01:10:01,165 --> 01:10:05,919
Let me die you fools.
Marek, you'll be lost.

449
01:10:36,325 --> 01:10:39,327
It's black as pitch.
- Hang on.

450
01:10:42,832 --> 01:10:46,043
Tempus Alorus luminescent.

451
01:10:55,677 --> 01:10:58,431
Tempus Alorus luminescent.

452
01:11:16,699 --> 01:11:19,577
Lead the way.

453
01:11:21,861 --> 01:11:26,783
And the good elf found his
sacks and sacks of gold

454
01:11:27,500 --> 01:11:29,878
Shut up, Dagen.

455
01:11:33,841 --> 01:11:38,970
There is a doorway up ahead.
- There better be treasure in here.

456
01:11:45,269 --> 01:11:48,606
What is that sound?
- Rats.

457
01:11:49,857 --> 01:11:51,274
Let's go.

458
01:11:52,485 --> 01:11:55,029
Are you sure that's a rat?

459
01:11:55,321 --> 01:11:57,740
The sound is amplified by the tunnel.

460
01:11:58,490 --> 01:12:03,411
Don't worry, Dagen.
because there are so many of them.

461
01:12:21,055 --> 01:12:22,473
Get it off me.

462
01:12:30,438 --> 01:12:33,818
That's not a rat.
That's a dog.

463
01:12:34,317 --> 01:12:39,197
There's your chance, you know. One slip with
the sword that wouldn't do to blame you.

464
01:12:39,281 --> 01:12:42,367
Except maybe .

465
01:12:42,377 --> 01:12:44,353
If I kill you it won't be in secret.

466
01:12:46,539 --> 01:12:49,582
Kill me? What are
you talking about?

467
01:12:54,255 --> 01:12:57,424
Let's keep moving.

468
01:13:08,019 --> 01:13:12,105
Ogres, rats.

469
01:13:12,189 --> 01:13:15,567
Why is it always so damn complicated?

470
01:13:19,613 --> 01:13:21,489
Hello?

471
01:13:36,255 --> 01:13:39,632
He's alive, but barely breathing.

472
01:13:41,093 --> 01:13:44,680
He's  asleep.
- Asleep? What do you mean asleep?

473
01:13:46,848 --> 01:13:48,726
This place is cursed.

474
01:13:50,435 --> 01:13:52,979
Your senses can't be trusted.

475
01:13:53,147 --> 01:13:55,441
We need to keep moving.

476
01:13:55,690 --> 01:13:59,403
Keep your thoughts clear
and on the task ahead.

477
01:13:59,903 --> 01:14:02,864
We can tie ourselves together.

478
01:14:02,948 --> 01:14:06,451
If you fall asleep, the
others will you through.

479
01:14:06,535 --> 01:14:10,622
I am not tying myself to anyone.
- Shut up.

480
01:14:11,539 --> 01:14:15,377
This is our first junction.
The door is this way.

481
01:14:16,921 --> 01:14:18,881
It's a beautiful knot.

482
01:14:29,766 --> 01:14:32,185
A bit of magic, eh?

483
01:14:32,269 --> 01:14:35,688
I know somebody who needs
this more than you do.

484
01:14:43,113 --> 01:14:47,535
I do not understand.
This is not on the map.

485
01:14:47,149 --> 01:14:49,651
Look. Giants.

486
01:14:52,081 --> 01:14:56,209
They have sought refuge here
when the city was buried.

487
01:14:56,793 --> 01:15:00,631
A cold, dark place to die.

488
01:15:02,591 --> 01:15:06,470
Do you think they knew
their world was going to end?

489
01:15:07,929 --> 01:15:10,975
Do you think they thought
they could stop it?

490
01:15:11,058 --> 01:15:13,434
They did not have you.

491
01:15:36,249 --> 01:15:39,419
Sentry, report.
- All dead, Captain. All of them.

492
01:15:39,502 --> 01:15:42,463
Who is there?
- We need to retreat.

493
01:15:42,672 --> 01:15:46,177
No one is here. They're all dead.
- Say your name.

494
01:15:54,894 --> 01:15:57,353
Come on, keep going.

495
01:16:18,667 --> 01:16:22,795
There should be a door here.
It can't just end.

496
01:16:44,234 --> 01:16:48,697
I can feel it. We're getting closer.

497
01:16:54,536 --> 01:16:57,247
I can feel the Darkspore.

498
01:17:25,641 --> 01:17:28,978
Where's one, there's more.

499
01:17:34,576 --> 01:17:37,162
Hello, sunshine.

500
01:18:01,228 --> 01:18:04,231
The treasure of Mondiatha.

501
01:18:15,325 --> 01:18:18,245
Why is it moving?

502
01:18:21,247 --> 01:18:23,875
Be very, very still.

503
01:18:32,300 --> 01:18:34,386
Oh, fuck me.

504
01:18:38,057 --> 01:18:39,600
Oh, fuck me.

505
01:18:40,141 --> 01:18:43,978
Dagen, we really need to
have a talk on your timing.

506
01:18:44,897 --> 01:18:46,647
Run.

507
01:18:55,657 --> 01:18:58,786
Maybe this isn't real.
- No, it's real.

508
01:18:58,869 --> 01:19:01,538
Up here. This way.

509
01:19:01,621 --> 01:19:04,540
We have to go back. We
have to find the stone.

510
01:19:04,624 --> 01:19:07,669
Fuck the stone if we are going to die.

511
01:19:08,127 --> 01:19:09,922
Hold it.

512
01:19:14,843 --> 01:19:17,429
I smell fresh air. Help me up.

513
01:19:30,734 --> 01:19:32,944
Hurry up, Dagen.

514
01:19:36,573 --> 01:19:38,699
This way.

515
01:19:41,829 --> 01:19:46,582
Gods, it's like escaping a mother's womb.

516
01:20:09,605 --> 01:20:11,274
Run.

517
01:20:12,525 --> 01:20:14,778
Dagen,

518
01:20:14,861 --> 01:20:18,739
Then better do it quickly Thane. I am not
looking forward being eaten by a dragon.

519
01:20:43,056 --> 01:20:47,727
I think the Darkspore is
keeping that dragon alive.

520
01:20:50,230 --> 01:20:52,191
This might help.
- Schasaat.

521
01:20:54,026 --> 01:20:57,195
Save it for the dragon.
- What was that?

522
01:20:57,904 --> 01:21:01,032
If we distract it ...

523
01:21:01,115 --> 01:21:03,827
I might have a clean shot
at it with this wand.

524
01:21:03,911 --> 01:21:05,369
Split up. Surround ...

525
01:21:05,454 --> 01:21:07,955
Or, it will pick us off one at a time.

526
01:21:08,040 --> 01:21:11,710
That's good plan.
- You could get us all killed.

527
01:21:11,792 --> 01:21:14,378
Run, coward.
It's that dragon or my sword.

528
01:21:14,462 --> 01:21:16,882
Oh, you are the big fyking hero,
when Qole did all the work.

529
01:21:16,964 --> 01:21:19,426
Split up or we all die.

530
01:21:29,260 --> 01:21:32,971
Hey, come and get me you fucker.

531
01:21:42,282 --> 01:21:43,699
Schasaat.

532
01:22:17,191 --> 01:22:18,818
Schasaat.

533
01:22:23,198 --> 01:22:24,991
Schasaat.

534
01:22:46,388 --> 01:22:47,931
Marek.

535
01:23:11,329 --> 01:23:12,913
Dagen.

536
01:23:14,082 --> 01:23:15,583
Qole.

537
01:23:23,133 --> 01:23:25,135
Hey.

538
01:23:27,012 --> 01:23:29,430
Come and get me.

539
01:23:30,473 --> 01:23:33,226
Come.
- Be careful, Marek.

540
01:23:37,313 --> 01:23:39,191
Miamortile odillus rittik.

541
01:23:55,581 --> 01:24:00,295
Bring it to me.
You're mine.

542
01:24:12,807 --> 01:24:14,309
You are alive.

543
01:24:14,392 --> 01:24:18,522
Fuck me. Be more careful next time.

544
01:24:18,604 --> 01:24:20,690
You're welcome.

545
01:24:25,861 --> 01:24:28,739
I'm good without a kiss, thank you.

546
01:24:29,740 --> 01:24:33,829
Take the Darkspore.
Run and don't look back.

547
01:24:33,911 --> 01:24:35,663
All the way to Gojun Pye's.

548
01:24:36,914 --> 01:24:41,085
Of all the treasure I've left behind ...

549
01:24:41,168 --> 01:24:45,132
this is the one piece of
loot that I managed to grab.

550
01:24:45,215 --> 01:24:48,468
Think you can hold on to it this time?

551
01:24:49,927 --> 01:24:54,224
There's one shot.
- Let's save Teela.

552
01:24:54,266 --> 01:24:59,270
You have the most selfless heart that
I know. See that, not the end of it.

553
01:25:29,843 --> 01:25:33,179
The darkness takes its time.

554
01:25:35,599 --> 01:25:39,811
The only absolute power
in this world is death.

555
01:25:43,064 --> 01:25:46,318
Goddess of light, hear my prayer.

556
01:25:46,693 --> 01:25:52,324
Fill with your presence and let
me die according to your will.

557
01:25:52,740 --> 01:25:57,912
You will die, but not without
your friends as a witness.

558
01:26:05,044 --> 01:26:10,049
You have touched it. I can tell.
Its power lingers with you still.

559
01:26:10,467 --> 01:26:12,635
Where is your elf?

560
01:26:14,261 --> 01:26:16,640
He's buried.

561
01:26:17,723 --> 01:26:19,809
Now honour our agreement and heal her.

562
01:26:19,893 --> 01:26:23,897
You would trade what matters
most for what matters least.

563
01:26:23,979 --> 01:26:26,817
You have not yet known the
importance of sacrifice.

564
01:26:27,651 --> 01:26:30,987
Or how to cover your lies.

565
01:26:39,203 --> 01:26:45,293
Where is the Darkspore?
- We never found it.

566
01:26:45,377 --> 01:26:49,172
Stop, stop!
- That's enough.

567
01:26:56,680 --> 01:27:02,101
My dept to you is paid, shaman.
Release me from my bondage.

568
01:27:04,019 --> 01:27:09,401
You have served me well my child.
You are cursed no more.

569
01:27:10,110 --> 01:27:15,155
You fucking bastard. I told you.
They trusted you.

570
01:27:15,574 --> 01:27:18,742
They've done their part.
Set them free.

571
01:27:19,952 --> 01:27:21,705
Where's our money?

572
01:27:25,667 --> 01:27:28,253
No.
- You gave your word.

573
01:27:28,711 --> 01:27:30,087
No.

574
01:27:42,683 --> 01:27:45,644
Marek, I know you.

575
01:27:58,283 --> 01:28:02,536
What was I supposed to do?
We would have died.

576
01:28:04,580 --> 01:28:06,874
There is always another way.

577
01:28:16,258 --> 01:28:17,509
Schasaat.

578
01:28:23,642 --> 01:28:25,684
Kill them.

579
01:32:34,474 --> 01:32:39,772
You cannot escape.
I'll be back.

580
01:32:47,197 --> 01:32:49,323
I'm sorry, Marek.

581
01:32:56,998 --> 01:32:58,457
Remember ...

582
01:33:00,001 --> 01:33:02,629
fate is not written.

583
01:34:27,963 --> 01:34:32,677
What happened?
- We're all dying. That's what happened.

584
01:34:33,593 --> 01:34:36,513
You're going fix us up, aren't you?

585
01:34:38,266 --> 01:34:41,853
I can stabilize everyone at least. Kishkumen?

586
01:34:41,935 --> 01:34:45,356
Escaped with the Darkspore.
- Then we failed.

587
01:35:42,788 --> 01:35:47,251
It were not wrong to trust or to hope.

588
01:35:48,460 --> 01:35:51,547
It was all for nothing.

589
01:35:59,597 --> 01:36:04,769
If we are not fighting this darkness,
we are becoming a part of it.

590
01:36:05,144 --> 01:36:07,646
Caeryn taught me that.

591
01:36:07,261 --> 01:36:11,641
And you have not stopped
fighting this darkness, Marek.

592
01:36:15,487 --> 01:36:21,160
I was wrong. There is a great
goodness inside of you.

593
01:36:21,567 --> 01:36:23,486
And a great strength.

594
01:36:25,415 --> 01:36:28,125
And your battle is only just beginning.

595
01:36:42,764 --> 01:36:44,307
Where we'll go?

596
01:36:45,893 --> 01:36:51,189
Anisette instructed Caeryn that I was
to stay with this party. And I mean to.

597
01:36:52,858 --> 01:36:56,946
I will follow you till the
goddess tells me otherwise.

598
01:37:28,643 --> 01:37:32,522
I'm sorry that I wasn't
able to heal you further.

599
01:37:33,774 --> 01:37:36,652
I'd be ungrateful to ask for anything more.

600
01:37:40,239 --> 01:37:46,746
When I was dying, at the gates
of Mondiatha, I was in agony.

601
01:37:48,039 --> 01:37:53,376
I wished for death. But,
I held on to life because ...

602
01:37:53,793 --> 01:37:57,214
I long to see you safe and .

603
01:38:29,538 --> 01:38:31,999
Do you know what I am going do next?

604
01:38:33,083 --> 01:38:37,712
I'll get the biggest tankard of ale at
Hammerhead's and spend a week on my back.

605
01:38:49,724 --> 01:38:52,644
And how are you going to pay for that?

606
01:39:06,032 --> 01:39:09,036
Scaly bastard had a toothy grave.

607
01:39:09,412 --> 01:39:13,456
It's one hundred gold a
piece. In wizard's guild.

608
01:39:18,504 --> 01:39:20,672
And that makes your share.

609
01:39:22,425 --> 01:39:24,884
Six hundred gold.

610
01:39:40,067 --> 01:39:44,112
Six hundred gold. I am here
to purchase my freedom.

611
01:39:44,196 --> 01:39:47,032
Very well, show me your mark.

612
01:39:58,878 --> 01:40:01,756
Do I know you?
- Doubtful.

613
01:40:02,297 --> 01:40:04,257
Hold.

614
01:40:06,093 --> 01:40:10,096
This girl is a runaway.

615
01:40:10,181 --> 01:40:12,850
She's my property.
- Dagen...

616
01:40:15,853 --> 01:40:21,275
Her life is for my taking. Maggot.

617
01:40:21,359 --> 01:40:23,027
He's lying.

618
01:40:24,195 --> 01:40:29,200
600 gold pieces is the indentured
sum. In this bag is 600 gold.

619
01:40:29,282 --> 01:40:32,703
Give me the contract to
make me a free woman.

620
01:40:33,954 --> 01:40:37,291
600 gold earned by
a runaway?

621
01:40:37,374 --> 01:40:43,506
Magistrate, please. This
girl, she's my property.

622
01:40:44,589 --> 01:40:49,135
And I believe this makes
this gold belong to me.

623
01:40:50,428 --> 01:40:51,931
Fine.

624
01:40:53,808 --> 01:40:56,893
Please. This isn't right.

625
01:40:56,976 --> 01:41:01,941
He is your master under the law.
Nothing could be more right. - Thank you.

626
01:41:02,024 --> 01:41:04,442
No, this isn't ...

627
01:41:04,526 --> 01:41:06,986
Marek, we will come for you.

628
01:41:07,070 --> 01:41:10,533
You have cost me a lot of
time and pain my dear.

629
01:41:10,657 --> 01:41:14,911
But I'm going delight in finding
ways for you to make it up to me.

630
01:41:16,579 --> 01:41:18,541
Get out.

631
01:41:31,262 --> 01:41:34,139
My friends will come for me.

632
01:41:47,653 --> 01:41:51,281
Quiet. That people are trying to sleep.

633
01:42:00,624 --> 01:42:04,587
Listen very carefully you worthless piece of shit.

634
01:42:06,505 --> 01:42:09,675
You're going sign away ownership
for the slave girl Marek ...

635
01:42:09,759 --> 01:42:13,762
or I'll cut that hand off and do it myself.

636
01:42:17,183 --> 01:42:19,350
What?
- What's he saying?

637
01:42:19,435 --> 01:42:22,354
Say again.
- What?

638
01:42:21,803 --> 01:42:24,179
He says that he is right-handed.

639
01:42:25,733 --> 01:42:28,359
Sign, maggot.

640
01:42:34,324 --> 01:42:36,284
Beautiful.

641
01:42:36,994 --> 01:42:39,788
There you are you pig
filth. Nice and legal.

642
01:42:39,871 --> 01:42:43,501
We're not really going to pay him, huh?

643
01:42:43,584 --> 01:42:46,837
If you ever follow her
again, we'll be back.

644
01:42:46,920 --> 01:42:51,759
And this time that little prick
of yours won't survive the visit.

645
01:43:16,742 --> 01:43:19,577
Hey hold up little marmot.

646
01:43:22,747 --> 01:43:25,083
They're waiting for us.

647
01:43:46,479 --> 01:43:49,567
It is good to see you.
- You too.

648
01:43:54,154 --> 01:43:57,615
Ready for another adventure?
- What? Now?

649
01:44:08,751 --> 01:44:13,506
Maybe we should yet at
a slightly warmer place.
