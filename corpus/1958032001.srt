1
00:00:46,632 --> 00:00:48,117
Before The beginning,

2
00:00:48,151 --> 00:00:51,534
God created powerful archangels.

3
00:00:51,568 --> 00:00:54,882
After many years of
peace and harmony,

4
00:00:54,916 --> 00:00:57,781
a war broke out as
one of the archangels

5
00:00:57,816 --> 00:01:00,715
and his minions
tried to remove God.

6
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:03,132
They were exiled from heaven.

7
00:01:04,271 --> 00:01:07,550
God's greatest
creation, humankind,

8
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:10,829
is now being threatened
by that archangel,

9
00:01:10,863 --> 00:01:12,520
my brother, Lucifer.

10
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:17,698
I have been sent to earth
to thwart his attacks.

11
00:02:04,745 --> 00:02:06,988
Judge Ceiver, well, well, well.

12
00:02:07,023 --> 00:02:08,473
Pastor Matt.

13
00:02:08,507 --> 00:02:09,474
How are you this fine evening?

14
00:02:09,508 --> 00:02:10,751
So many things going my way.

15
00:02:12,097 --> 00:02:14,617
How goes your ministry?

16
00:02:14,651 --> 00:02:15,894
I'm struggling.

17
00:02:15,928 --> 00:02:18,276
It's occupational
hazard, I think.

18
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:20,450
Hmm, it's not uncommon.

19
00:02:20,485 --> 00:02:21,969
Humans are flawed.

20
00:02:23,177 --> 00:02:26,456
I don't know if I
can truly listen to,

21
00:02:26,491 --> 00:02:30,874
and love unconditionally
all these inmates, you know?

22
00:02:32,359 --> 00:02:36,397
All these child molesters
and murderers and rapists.

23
00:02:36,432 --> 00:02:37,571
Interesting.

24
00:02:39,124 --> 00:02:43,784
But aren't we just one act
from being them ourselves?

25
00:02:49,099 --> 00:02:51,999
Looks like a storm's coming.

26
00:02:52,033 --> 00:02:55,175
Have a good night, judge.
Good night.

27
00:02:57,625 --> 00:02:59,075
A storm, indeed.

28
00:03:07,635 --> 00:03:11,777
Well, I say let it pour.

29
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:22,580
Come on!

30
00:03:24,342 --> 00:03:26,309
No, no, no, no.

31
00:04:23,124 --> 00:04:26,473
Hello.

32
00:04:26,507 --> 00:04:27,646
Hello?

33
00:04:27,681 --> 00:04:29,614
You belong to your father,

34
00:04:29,648 --> 00:04:31,892
and so shall carry
out his desires.

35
00:04:31,926 --> 00:04:33,480
What? Hey, is this?

36
00:04:33,514 --> 00:04:36,448
As to the son from the father.

37
00:04:36,483 --> 00:04:37,898
The father of lies.

38
00:04:40,487 --> 00:04:41,487
Hey! Hey!

39
00:05:42,307 --> 00:05:44,896
Give it up, I know
you're in here.

40
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:50,142
Come on, man,
there's no way out.

41
00:06:08,506 --> 00:06:10,197
Where the hell
did you come from?

42
00:06:10,231 --> 00:06:11,647
What did he do?

43
00:06:11,681 --> 00:06:12,993
Who are you?

44
00:06:13,027 --> 00:06:14,235
Eden.

45
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:15,375
Eden, what?

46
00:06:16,617 --> 00:06:17,617
Just Eden?

47
00:06:21,277 --> 00:06:23,210
- What?
- I don't know.

48
00:06:28,077 --> 00:06:30,124
You wouldn't happen to
have an extra phone in there,

49
00:06:30,148 --> 00:06:31,356
would you?

50
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:34,152
I prefer face to
face communication.

51
00:06:35,567 --> 00:06:38,398
Hey, would you
like a cookie, Mac?

52
00:06:41,504 --> 00:06:43,023
How'd you know my name?

53
00:06:43,057 --> 00:06:44,783
Now, is that a no?

54
00:06:46,785 --> 00:06:48,684
Is what a no?

55
00:06:48,718 --> 00:06:51,203
No, you don't want a cookie.

56
00:06:52,204 --> 00:06:53,689
They're delicious.

57
00:06:56,726 --> 00:06:57,865
Who are you?

58
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:00,558
I told you, Eden.

59
00:07:03,871 --> 00:07:05,666
Something about you.

60
00:07:06,874 --> 00:07:09,187
I don't know, you're not
like the rest of them.

61
00:07:09,221 --> 00:07:12,017
Not like the rest of who?

62
00:07:12,052 --> 00:07:16,125
Not like the rest of
the homeless people?

63
00:07:16,159 --> 00:07:17,540
Women?

64
00:07:17,575 --> 00:07:18,575
Black women?

65
00:07:19,715 --> 00:07:20,715
Humans?

66
00:07:27,412 --> 00:07:29,241
What are you doing
up here anyway?

67
00:07:29,276 --> 00:07:31,658
Waiting for you.

68
00:07:31,692 --> 00:07:34,039
You do
realize you're trespassing?

69
00:07:34,074 --> 00:07:38,768
And you do realize that
you are no longer a cop,

70
00:07:38,803 --> 00:07:40,114
Brian MacDougal?

71
00:07:42,358 --> 00:07:43,739
Okay, I get it.

72
00:07:43,773 --> 00:07:45,257
You caught the news.

73
00:07:45,292 --> 00:07:47,373
What do you have, a newspaper,
a TV in there or something?

74
00:07:47,397 --> 00:07:49,227
You don't know a thing about me.

75
00:07:49,261 --> 00:07:52,472
Ooh, you're carrying
a lot of weight.

76
00:07:55,095 --> 00:07:58,581
And to think that
you always dreamed

77
00:07:58,616 --> 00:08:01,481
about doing this when
you were a child.

78
00:08:01,515 --> 00:08:04,553
Now your grandfather,
and his father,

79
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,521
they were both cops, right?

80
00:08:07,556 --> 00:08:10,490
Yep, and I wish they would've
beat some sense into me.

81
00:08:10,524 --> 00:08:11,767
You're tired.

82
00:08:13,182 --> 00:08:16,910
And that's understandable
after what happened.

83
00:08:16,944 --> 00:08:19,153
Who the hell do
you think you are?

84
00:08:19,188 --> 00:08:20,983
And who do you think you're-

85
00:08:39,311 --> 00:08:40,796
- Go ahead.

86
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:42,280
Do it!

87
00:08:42,314 --> 00:08:44,385
Add one more to the list.

88
00:08:45,697 --> 00:08:49,770
Stay back.

89
00:08:50,978 --> 00:08:51,978
You.

90
00:08:52,808 --> 00:08:54,119
Yeah, it's me.

91
00:08:57,226 --> 00:08:58,226
Do it!

92
00:08:59,297 --> 00:09:01,126
It'll be one more down.

93
00:09:02,818 --> 00:09:04,958
You two know each other?

94
00:09:07,719 --> 00:09:10,204
Is he the one you were chasing?

95
00:09:10,239 --> 00:09:11,239
Yes.

96
00:09:12,448 --> 00:09:14,657
Mmm, now what did you do?

97
00:09:16,141 --> 00:09:18,488
I ain't done nothing wrong.

98
00:09:18,523 --> 00:09:23,252
I was trying to get away from
this crazy, vicious animal.

99
00:09:24,702 --> 00:09:26,255
Crazy dog.

100
00:09:26,289 --> 00:09:27,670
You wasn't there.

101
00:09:27,705 --> 00:09:29,292
You didn't hear it.

102
00:09:31,709 --> 00:09:33,849
What are you even doing here?

103
00:09:33,883 --> 00:09:36,403
This is your side of
the street anymore.

104
00:09:36,437 --> 00:09:39,924
I wasn't supposed
to be here tonight.

105
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:42,098
Look, you startled me,

106
00:09:42,133 --> 00:09:44,653
and I automatically
went into cop mode.

107
00:09:44,687 --> 00:09:47,759
That's always the
excuse, isn't it?

108
00:09:51,245 --> 00:09:56,216
Your face has been all over
the news since that shooting.

109
00:09:56,975 --> 00:09:58,494
I was at the protest.

110
00:10:00,634 --> 00:10:02,084
I organized it.

111
00:10:02,118 --> 00:10:04,845
You were standing right
there next to the chief's son

112
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,262
when he shot Areleus
Jenkins down in cold blood.

113
00:10:08,297 --> 00:10:10,713
The man was just protesting.

114
00:10:10,748 --> 00:10:12,370
Respectfully.

115
00:10:12,404 --> 00:10:14,061
Peacefully. Legally.

116
00:10:15,476 --> 00:10:18,134
Had no weapons, posed no threat.

117
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,217
You made quite a name
for yourself out of this,

118
00:10:21,241 --> 00:10:22,138
hadn't you?

119
00:10:22,173 --> 00:10:24,451
Yeah, I know who you are.

120
00:10:24,485 --> 00:10:26,591
Somebody's gotta
stand up for this city.

121
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:29,490
Standing up for the city,
but you're running from a dog?

122
00:10:29,525 --> 00:10:31,423
I got my limit, okay?

123
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:34,841
Don't try to change the subject.

124
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:39,190
I still can't believe
that the DA and the mayor

125
00:10:39,224 --> 00:10:42,503
took your word over
everybody else's.

126
00:10:42,538 --> 00:10:46,507
Over 300 people, a
mixed crowd, mind you,

127
00:10:46,542 --> 00:10:50,788
say they saw an unarmed man
shot down in cold blood!

128
00:10:51,996 --> 00:10:54,826
Now, how is it that
only two people,

129
00:10:56,483 --> 00:10:58,450
the chief's son and you,

130
00:11:01,902 --> 00:11:06,355
say the exact opposite
and your story's believed?

131
00:11:06,389 --> 00:11:09,358
You don't understand
how it works!

132
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,327
As painful as
the truth may be.

133
00:11:14,846 --> 00:11:17,159
It will always set you free.

134
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:21,991
I wanted to tell the truth.

135
00:11:22,026 --> 00:11:23,061
I tried, but-

136
00:11:24,856 --> 00:11:26,444
- You were afraid,

137
00:11:26,478 --> 00:11:29,240
afraid of what
would happen next.

138
00:11:30,379 --> 00:11:33,347
That's your chief?

139
00:11:33,382 --> 00:11:34,694
Hm?

140
00:11:34,728 --> 00:11:36,937
Aren't you going answer it?

141
00:11:36,972 --> 00:11:39,802
Bet he's wondering
where you are.

142
00:11:39,837 --> 00:11:42,943
Why you haven't stopped by to
pick up your Purple Heart yet.

143
00:11:42,978 --> 00:11:45,256
After all, you are his hero.

144
00:11:47,154 --> 00:11:49,605
Matter of fact, give it to me.

145
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:52,919
I got a few things
to say to your chief.

146
00:11:54,265 --> 00:11:56,267
He's no longer my chief.

147
00:11:56,301 --> 00:11:59,097
You still took the
fall for some people

148
00:11:59,132 --> 00:12:02,342
that wouldn't do the
same thing for you?

149
00:12:03,792 --> 00:12:06,760
Must be a bad feeling being
at the bottom again, huh?

150
00:12:06,795 --> 00:12:11,282
All right, that's
enough outta you, Randolph.

151
00:12:12,766 --> 00:12:14,906
How do you know my name?

152
00:12:16,701 --> 00:12:20,636
You're always trying
to fill that vacant spot

153
00:12:21,844 --> 00:12:24,882
inside of you.

154
00:12:24,916 --> 00:12:26,746
Isn't that right, Mac?

155
00:12:30,957 --> 00:12:33,994
When you first
joined that force,

156
00:12:34,029 --> 00:12:36,894
you were on a fast
trip to the top.

157
00:12:37,998 --> 00:12:40,311
And, ooh, that police chief,

158
00:12:41,726 --> 00:12:45,178
he you sure took
a liking to you.

159
00:12:51,253 --> 00:12:53,773
Hey chief, would
you like some more coffee?

160
00:12:53,807 --> 00:12:56,258
Felt good to be seen,

161
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:01,228
especially by someone
that you respected.

162
00:13:01,263 --> 00:13:05,957
He quickly became like the
father that you always wanted.

163
00:13:07,821 --> 00:13:10,790
He's not the man
I thought he was.

164
00:13:11,756 --> 00:13:12,756
People,

165
00:13:14,207 --> 00:13:15,553
they disappoint.

166
00:13:17,003 --> 00:13:18,003
They lie.

167
00:13:21,593 --> 00:13:23,492
When someone you hold
in a high regard,

168
00:13:23,526 --> 00:13:26,598
turns out not to be who
you thought they were,

169
00:13:26,633 --> 00:13:28,635
that's really something.

170
00:13:31,638 --> 00:13:34,986
First time I saw the
chief beat his wife,

171
00:13:36,746 --> 00:13:38,818
he had that same look in his eye

172
00:13:38,852 --> 00:13:41,579
that my dad would get
when he would hit my mom.

173
00:13:41,613 --> 00:13:44,754
Must really be something.

174
00:13:44,789 --> 00:13:48,379
When you realize that
you're not the hero

175
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:51,969
you thought you'd be,

176
00:13:52,003 --> 00:13:53,763
'cause you look in the mirror

177
00:13:53,798 --> 00:13:56,145
and all you see is a
coward looking back at you,

178
00:13:56,180 --> 00:14:00,253
because you didn't have
the guts to stop somebody.

179
00:14:07,122 --> 00:14:10,090
What did you do,
Eden, for all this?

180
00:14:12,644 --> 00:14:14,129
What I still do,

181
00:14:16,338 --> 00:14:18,719
I help people make decisions.

182
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:22,723
What kind of decisions?

183
00:14:22,758 --> 00:14:27,728
Decisions that will influence
the shape of things to come.

184
00:14:28,902 --> 00:14:31,974
Essentially, the fate of
many individual lives.

185
00:14:40,672 --> 00:14:41,742
You're tired.

186
00:14:43,986 --> 00:14:47,748
You haven't had a good
night sleep in months.

187
00:14:49,336 --> 00:14:50,786
It's this city.

188
00:14:52,684 --> 00:14:55,584
Nothing good can come
from a city like this.

189
00:14:55,618 --> 00:14:57,379
I begged to differ.

190
00:14:58,621 --> 00:15:00,451
A long time ago,

191
00:15:00,485 --> 00:15:05,007
they said that nothing good
would come out of Nazareth.

192
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:08,458
What?

193
00:15:09,529 --> 00:15:12,014
This city has great promise.

194
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,405
Well, if it's not this city,

195
00:15:24,993 --> 00:15:28,651
then it's the people
that make up this city.

196
00:16:36,409 --> 00:16:38,894
48 hours this time.

197
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:42,001
They never keep me.

198
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:44,279
I'm not crazy.

199
00:17:12,479 --> 00:17:16,518
It's probably why I
never had kids of my own.

200
00:17:16,552 --> 00:17:20,729
I know firsthand how bad a
father can screw up as kids.

201
00:17:20,763 --> 00:17:22,627
Ain't that the truth?

202
00:17:22,662 --> 00:17:26,907
Randolph, your stepfather
was a very bad man too.

203
00:17:29,531 --> 00:17:32,672
He would tie your
wrist to your ankles

204
00:17:34,018 --> 00:17:35,847
and he would beat you.

205
00:17:37,504 --> 00:17:42,371
And then he would lock you in
a closet, sometimes for days.

206
00:17:44,546 --> 00:17:46,410
Is she right?

207
00:17:46,444 --> 00:17:49,620
So what, man, what about it?

208
00:17:49,654 --> 00:17:51,587
I'm not judging you, man.

209
00:17:51,622 --> 00:17:54,142
Been, knocked around more
times than I care to remember.

210
00:17:54,176 --> 00:17:55,833
That's right, Mac.

211
00:17:58,456 --> 00:18:03,116
Your father, he would make
you go hungry for days on end.

212
00:18:06,499 --> 00:18:09,985
And he would sit across
the table from him

213
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,989
and he would make you watch
him as he ate his dinner

214
00:18:14,023 --> 00:18:15,335
and his dessert.

215
00:18:16,819 --> 00:18:20,616
And he would dare you to
ask for something to eat.

216
00:18:22,342 --> 00:18:26,381
And then he would send
you to your room hungry.

217
00:18:26,415 --> 00:18:30,109
And you would eat from
people's garbage cans

218
00:18:33,974 --> 00:18:35,804
on your way to school.

219
00:18:35,838 --> 00:18:37,081
Damn.

220
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:40,705
And the way he
would beat your mother.

221
00:18:41,982 --> 00:18:44,053
She never told anybody.

222
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:49,438
She was scared of
what my grandfather

223
00:18:49,473 --> 00:18:52,269
and his brothers
in blue would do.

224
00:18:53,718 --> 00:18:57,308
She didn't wanna leave
us kids without a father.

225
00:18:59,345 --> 00:19:02,900
Can't imagine the kind
of guilt that carries.

226
00:19:02,934 --> 00:19:03,934
I can.

227
00:19:05,316 --> 00:19:09,803
You two have more in common
than you will ever know.

228
00:19:13,531 --> 00:19:15,844
Turn my head way too much.

229
00:19:19,503 --> 00:19:21,539
Looking the other
way when other cops

230
00:19:21,574 --> 00:19:26,544
were planting drugs on innocent
victims, lying on the stand.

231
00:19:27,442 --> 00:19:29,547
Move ahead another step in line.

232
00:19:33,033 --> 00:19:35,795
I got nobody to
blame for myself.

233
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:41,835
What about Tamir?

234
00:19:47,462 --> 00:19:49,912
Hey, what you doing, punk?

235
00:19:49,947 --> 00:19:51,293
What? Nothing?

236
00:19:51,328 --> 00:19:52,570
I wasn't doing anything.

237
00:19:52,605 --> 00:19:54,434
I was just taking
this bike home.

238
00:19:54,469 --> 00:19:55,987
I didn't mean to do anything.

239
00:19:56,022 --> 00:19:59,957
Story after story, but you
should have done different.

240
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:06,481
You didn't do anything to stop
that one neither, did you?

241
00:20:06,515 --> 00:20:07,515
I tried.

242
00:20:09,242 --> 00:20:11,348
But you didn't.

243
00:20:11,382 --> 00:20:13,488
I thought I told
you not to come around here.

244
00:20:13,522 --> 00:20:14,802
I wasn't doing anything wrong.

245
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:21,772
Now you see, Ms. Eden,

246
00:20:21,806 --> 00:20:24,326
this is why I gather
crowds in the streets

247
00:20:24,361 --> 00:20:26,949
to protest this abuse of power.

248
00:20:28,675 --> 00:20:33,197
This is why I stand up,
because somebody has to!

249
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,510
I gotta wake up the people.

250
00:20:35,544 --> 00:20:37,650
Yes, wake up the people.

251
00:20:39,307 --> 00:20:41,412
Protest all the injustice.

252
00:20:44,381 --> 00:20:48,661
Protest, yes, you do that,
but you do the right way.

253
00:20:51,008 --> 00:20:54,874
You do it without the
violence, without the looting,

254
00:20:54,908 --> 00:20:58,533
without the fires, without
the breaking windows.

255
00:20:58,567 --> 00:21:00,707
And you educate the people.

256
00:21:01,605 --> 00:21:03,986
You educate the people

257
00:21:04,021 --> 00:21:08,336
and you teach them how
to educate themselves.

258
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:12,305
And you make sure that they
get together and they vote,

259
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:15,032
and they need to know
who they're voting for.

260
00:21:15,066 --> 00:21:18,207
And they've got to
vote every time,

261
00:21:18,242 --> 00:21:21,141
not just for the president
of the United States,

262
00:21:21,176 --> 00:21:23,454
but for the people
in that district,

263
00:21:23,489 --> 00:21:25,870
they've got to know
what they believe in.

264
00:21:25,905 --> 00:21:27,941
They've got to know
where they've come from.

265
00:21:27,976 --> 00:21:30,358
They've got to know
what they've done.

266
00:21:30,392 --> 00:21:31,980
Educate the people.

267
00:21:34,845 --> 00:21:37,019
And yes, you, you protest.

268
00:21:39,643 --> 00:21:41,955
But you do it the right way.

269
00:21:45,614 --> 00:21:50,101
So that's where your
abuse of power comes from.

270
00:21:50,136 --> 00:21:52,345
Are you serious?

271
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:54,658
So you're still not
gonna take responsibility

272
00:21:54,692 --> 00:21:58,178
for your actions
through all of this?

273
00:21:58,213 --> 00:22:02,251
That kid was countless
other black and brown kids.

274
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:07,774
What happened to him
happens on a regular.

275
00:22:11,537 --> 00:22:14,367
Now you're gonna shoot me?

276
00:22:14,402 --> 00:22:15,886
Hm?

277
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:18,095
Now you finally got the
courage to do something?

278
00:22:18,129 --> 00:22:19,303
Hm?

279
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:22,927
All that talk, should've
done what was right,

280
00:22:25,205 --> 00:22:28,347
but it ain't even
about them, man.

281
00:22:28,381 --> 00:22:31,971
It still all about you
protecting yourself,

282
00:22:33,938 --> 00:22:36,251
your jobs, your people, you.

283
00:22:44,259 --> 00:22:47,366
You gonna follow through
with it this time?

284
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:51,853
'Cause I sure as hell won't
go down a coward like you.

285
00:22:53,406 --> 00:22:57,928
This isn't for you.

286
00:23:03,589 --> 00:23:05,245
Put it down.

287
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,696
No, he's right,
this is the best way.

288
00:23:07,731 --> 00:23:10,147
No, there is another way.

289
00:23:10,181 --> 00:23:14,600
You don't have to carry
that weight around your neck

290
00:23:14,634 --> 00:23:18,569
for another moment,
for another second.

291
00:23:18,604 --> 00:23:22,401
If you are really sorry,
ask for forgiveness.

292
00:23:22,435 --> 00:23:24,403
God will forgive you.

293
00:23:24,437 --> 00:23:25,437
Why?

294
00:23:27,164 --> 00:23:28,441
Why should he?

295
00:23:28,476 --> 00:23:30,857
Are you sorry?

296
00:23:30,892 --> 00:23:31,892
Yes.

297
00:23:33,377 --> 00:23:35,344
I wish I had done
what was right,

298
00:23:35,379 --> 00:23:38,313
even if it cost me
everything else.

299
00:23:38,347 --> 00:23:41,420
You're not gonna
kill yourself, Mac.

300
00:23:41,454 --> 00:23:43,145
How do you know?

301
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:46,459
Like I told you
before, I know things.

302
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:49,980
Put, put that down.

303
00:24:02,268 --> 00:24:04,201
What do you want?

304
00:24:04,235 --> 00:24:05,235
Peace.

305
00:24:06,859 --> 00:24:08,585
I want peace.

306
00:24:08,619 --> 00:24:11,450
I need peace and forgiveness.

307
00:24:11,484 --> 00:24:14,142
Who or what do you believe in?

308
00:24:16,662 --> 00:24:17,904
I don't know.

309
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,046
And what about you?

310
00:24:25,084 --> 00:24:27,362
I believe there is a God.

311
00:24:28,708 --> 00:24:31,918
I have a lot of
questions concerning him,

312
00:24:31,953 --> 00:24:34,265
and I have a lot of
questions for him,

313
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:36,889
but yeah, I believe God exists.

314
00:24:42,377 --> 00:24:46,450
Now that peace and
forgiveness that you desire,

315
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:50,696
it's available,

316
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:55,666
but you have to be
willing to change.

317
00:25:30,459 --> 00:25:31,459
Answer it.

318
00:25:44,232 --> 00:25:48,305
Hello.

319
00:25:52,447 --> 00:25:53,448
Who is this?

320
00:25:58,108 --> 00:26:00,386
Who do you think that was?

321
00:26:02,699 --> 00:26:04,079
I don't know.

322
00:26:04,114 --> 00:26:06,426
I heard "It's still time."

323
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,948
Like, "Now's time."

324
00:26:13,675 --> 00:26:15,504
"Come, it's the time."

325
00:26:25,445 --> 00:26:27,758
Be clear headed, be alert.

326
00:26:31,313 --> 00:26:35,283
Your enemy, the dark one,
is like a roaring lion

327
00:26:37,492 --> 00:26:39,977
looking for someone to devour.

328
00:26:41,634 --> 00:26:42,634
Ms. Eden,

329
00:26:46,363 --> 00:26:49,021
I don't really know who you are,

330
00:26:50,229 --> 00:26:53,819
and I don't really know
what's going on here,

331
00:26:54,992 --> 00:26:58,133
but I feel like things
will be all right.

332
00:26:59,928 --> 00:27:02,517
You keep doing what you doing.

333
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:06,694
You are walking in your purpose.

334
00:27:08,868 --> 00:27:12,354
I look forward to
watching you as you grow

335
00:27:13,908 --> 00:27:17,221
into the leader that
you are born to be.

336
00:27:50,496 --> 00:27:51,600
I said leave!

337
00:28:28,396 --> 00:28:31,054
Mac, my dearest, dearest, Mac,

338
00:28:33,504 --> 00:28:36,853
you are now and have
always been my hero.

339
00:28:38,509 --> 00:28:43,066
My greatest pleasure on this
earth was being your wife.

340
00:28:46,241 --> 00:28:49,244
This cancer in my bones
will never reach the depths

341
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:52,316
that your love
reaches in my soul.

342
00:28:52,351 --> 00:28:54,836
I will see you in heaven, Mac,

343
00:28:56,907 --> 00:28:59,392
and just know that you always,

344
00:29:00,669 --> 00:29:04,639
always be my hero.

345
00:29:14,028 --> 00:29:15,339
You okay, man?

346
00:29:18,101 --> 00:29:20,759
Well, it's in your hands.

347
00:29:20,793 --> 00:29:22,761
I follow through with this,

348
00:29:22,795 --> 00:29:25,039
you realize what
this means, right?

349
00:29:25,073 --> 00:29:28,318
I realize what it
means if you don't.

350
00:29:30,423 --> 00:29:34,773
When we turn our heads
to things that are wrong

351
00:29:34,807 --> 00:29:39,639
and we don't do anything to
stop it, we are just as guilty,

352
00:29:39,674 --> 00:29:42,919
because we are allowing
it to continue.

353
00:29:44,472 --> 00:29:48,441
Just like you were willing
to lay down your gun,

354
00:29:49,822 --> 00:29:53,688
you are showing deep sacrifice
for the greater good.

355
00:29:55,241 --> 00:29:59,280
Isn't that the irony?

356
00:30:01,178 --> 00:30:04,561
That's what I assumed
I'd be doing as a cop.

357
00:30:04,595 --> 00:30:06,149
Be the hero, Mac.

358
00:30:08,737 --> 00:30:11,982
Be the hero for all
of those young boys

359
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:17,401
and all of those young
girls that are dreaming

360
00:30:17,436 --> 00:30:19,162
the way you once did.

361
00:30:20,749 --> 00:30:21,749
This.

362
00:30:22,579 --> 00:30:24,823
This is your new beginning.

363
00:30:26,652 --> 00:30:28,861
For you to take hold of it.

364
00:30:31,036 --> 00:30:32,036
You,

365
00:30:33,762 --> 00:30:36,696
you were created
to do good things.

366
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:44,842
Do good.

367
00:30:57,648 --> 00:31:00,720
There are a lot of
good cops out there.

368
00:31:00,755 --> 00:31:04,759
They're waiting for you
to do the right thing.

369
00:31:04,793 --> 00:31:08,004
You, you stand up
and you lead the way!

370
00:31:12,284 --> 00:31:14,320
Truth will set
you free, right?

371
00:31:14,355 --> 00:31:15,355
Yes.

372
00:31:25,573 --> 00:31:29,715
This is full of emails
and files and photographs

373
00:31:33,857 --> 00:31:38,724
and the dashboard cam footage
from the day of the shooting.

374
00:31:41,969 --> 00:31:44,592
I've been meaning to do
this for a long time.

375
00:31:44,626 --> 00:31:48,320
I just never had the
guts to follow through.

376
00:31:48,354 --> 00:31:50,529
This is the perfect time.

377
00:31:53,601 --> 00:31:54,601
Take it.

378
00:31:55,983 --> 00:32:00,159
Do what you do, man.

379
00:32:04,094 --> 00:32:05,475
We can do this.

380
00:32:07,166 --> 00:32:08,166
Right?

381
00:32:10,238 --> 00:32:13,655
Right?

382
00:32:28,187 --> 00:32:30,845
You don't wanna do this.

383
00:32:30,879 --> 00:32:33,952
I'm telling you, you
don't wanna do this.

384
00:33:34,736 --> 00:33:35,910
I was right.

385
00:33:40,846 --> 00:33:41,846
She's here.

386
00:34:00,452 --> 00:34:01,452
It's you.

387
00:34:02,523 --> 00:34:04,318
You're back.

388
00:34:04,352 --> 00:34:05,352
I am.

389
00:34:06,906 --> 00:34:08,632
I'm sorry, come in.

390
00:34:09,875 --> 00:34:11,359
It's just,

391
00:34:11,394 --> 00:34:14,190
I'm still so overwhelmed
that you're actually here.

392
00:34:15,950 --> 00:34:18,056
It looks like a storm is coming.

393
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:20,610
The storm is already here.

394
00:34:38,006 --> 00:34:40,008
How was your evening?

395
00:34:40,043 --> 00:34:42,873
Fruitful, Sister
Anne, fruitful.

396
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,083
I am so glad.

397
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:47,947
May I get you something?

398
00:34:47,982 --> 00:34:49,328
Anything.

399
00:34:49,363 --> 00:34:51,330
You are so good to me.

400
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:55,645
Serving you is an honor.

401
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:58,475
That God would use
me in this way.

402
00:34:59,787 --> 00:35:03,239
Don't, no, Sister
Anne, you don't bow me.

403
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:08,244
We only bow to Father God.

404
00:35:09,486 --> 00:35:11,937
The prophecy
will be fulfilled.

405
00:35:11,971 --> 00:35:15,113
Yes, the prophecy
will be fulfilled.

406
00:35:17,149 --> 00:35:19,117
Are you all ready?

407
00:35:19,151 --> 00:35:22,430
We have been
ready for centuries.

408
00:35:22,465 --> 00:35:24,156
Just waiting for you.

409
00:35:27,401 --> 00:35:30,128
Here, I'll give you your space.

410
00:35:30,162 --> 00:35:31,162
Thank you.

411
00:35:33,993 --> 00:35:34,993
Thank you.

412
00:35:46,454 --> 00:35:47,454
Father God,

413
00:35:50,424 --> 00:35:51,977
creator and source,

414
00:35:55,083 --> 00:35:56,395
ancient of days,

415
00:35:59,087 --> 00:36:03,471
as it has always been and
will be forever, I am yours.

416
00:36:27,012 --> 00:36:30,464
I will serve you, I
will worship you only.

417
00:36:35,469 --> 00:36:38,782
Use me.

418
00:37:03,704 --> 00:37:04,704
Lucifer.

419
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:08,812
Sister, I have missed you.

420
00:37:12,471 --> 00:37:15,509
And I missed you, brother.

421
00:37:18,581 --> 00:37:21,722
I wanna go back
to how we once were.

422
00:37:24,483 --> 00:37:25,967
We can't.

423
00:37:26,002 --> 00:37:27,659
Why not?

424
00:37:27,693 --> 00:37:31,663
Lucifer, what you've
done, it can't be undone.

425
00:37:35,598 --> 00:37:38,670
When you've tried
to remove Father God

426
00:37:38,704 --> 00:37:42,329
you severed ties that
can never be repaired.

427
00:37:43,468 --> 00:37:45,849
Your selfishness, your pride,

428
00:37:48,542 --> 00:37:50,751
your, your greed for power,

429
00:37:54,133 --> 00:37:57,240
it destroyed our
sacred relationship.

430
00:37:59,104 --> 00:38:00,174
You did this.

431
00:38:01,796 --> 00:38:04,247
Yes, brother, you did-

432
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:07,354
- I know!

433
00:38:07,388 --> 00:38:08,941
I'm sorry.

434
00:38:08,976 --> 00:38:10,080
I'm so sorry.

435
00:38:11,530 --> 00:38:13,221
I know that you are.

436
00:38:13,256 --> 00:38:14,671
Please.

437
00:38:14,706 --> 00:38:18,296
My one regret, my one
regret, it that I lost you.

438
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:24,405
There's gotta be
something I can do.

439
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:28,513
I've gained the world but
I have nothing without you.

440
00:38:28,547 --> 00:38:31,170
Please, my life is
miserable without you.

441
00:38:31,205 --> 00:38:32,931
I'm so sorry.

442
00:38:32,965 --> 00:38:36,900
I'm sorry too.

443
00:38:36,935 --> 00:38:39,109
Give another chance.

444
00:38:39,144 --> 00:38:41,664
Gimme another chance
to prove myself.

445
00:38:41,698 --> 00:38:43,079
Let me in.

446
00:38:43,113 --> 00:38:46,669
I can't come in
unless you allow me.

447
00:38:46,703 --> 00:38:48,084
I'll do anything.

448
00:38:49,741 --> 00:38:51,329
Tell me what to do!

449
00:38:52,502 --> 00:38:55,402
There's nothing
that you can do.

450
00:38:59,509 --> 00:39:02,961
And there's nothing,
nothing that I can do.

451
00:39:11,452 --> 00:39:12,452
No! No!

452
00:39:16,595 --> 00:39:17,803
No!

453
00:39:17,838 --> 00:39:18,838
No!

454
00:39:20,910 --> 00:39:24,362
Eden!

455
00:40:00,570 --> 00:40:01,951
Breaking news.

456
00:40:01,985 --> 00:40:04,781
We have live coverage as
protestors take to the streets.

457
00:40:04,816 --> 00:40:06,611
New video evidence comes forward

458
00:40:06,645 --> 00:40:09,407
about the Areleus
Jenkins police shooting.

459
00:40:09,441 --> 00:40:10,684
Dash cam footage,

460
00:40:10,718 --> 00:40:13,307
as well as a series of
incriminating emails,

461
00:40:13,341 --> 00:40:15,516
has surfaced showing
widespread corruption

462
00:40:15,551 --> 00:40:17,898
of the police force
to the very top.
