1
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:51,784
You fuckin' holding out on me?

2
00:00:51,786 --> 00:00:53,118
No.

3
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,119
No?

4
00:00:54,121 --> 00:00:55,120
You're not?

5
00:00:55,122 --> 00:00:56,188
Let go of me!

6
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:58,057
What are you gonna do? Huh?

7
00:00:58,059 --> 00:01:00,492
What are you gonna do?

8
00:01:00,494 --> 00:01:02,594
What are you...

9
00:01:04,131 --> 00:01:06,832
I can't breathe!

10
00:01:06,834 --> 00:01:09,301
Stupid, you are my whore.

11
00:01:09,303 --> 00:01:11,036
- You are.
- Hey!

12
00:01:16,343 --> 00:01:19,144
What the fuck you
gonna do with that, man?

13
00:01:19,146 --> 00:01:21,313
You know this kid?

14
00:01:21,315 --> 00:01:23,816
God damn if you
don't have balls.

15
00:01:23,818 --> 00:01:26,852
You're a fucking cripple, man.

16
00:01:26,854 --> 00:01:29,154
You can't do shit.

17
00:01:30,324 --> 00:01:31,423
He's fucking with me.

18
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:32,825
You're goddamn...

19
00:01:32,827 --> 00:01:34,426
No, you're fucking
crazy, man. You're...

20
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:38,263
Whoa!

21
00:01:38,265 --> 00:01:40,332
Hey, calm down, boy. Come on.
Don't get all worked up.

22
00:01:40,334 --> 00:01:43,335
Look, look. It's okay.
Look at that, huh?

23
00:01:43,337 --> 00:01:44,670
She's fine.

24
00:01:44,672 --> 00:01:46,371
I got my money.

25
00:01:46,373 --> 00:01:48,340
All right? Huh?

26
00:01:48,342 --> 00:01:50,676
Go to work.

27
00:01:53,814 --> 00:01:56,215
I fuckin' love you.

28
00:01:58,685 --> 00:02:00,686
You want to hear some muscle?

29
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:03,622
Oh, yeah!

30
00:02:04,691 --> 00:02:06,692
Next time, bubba.

31
00:02:20,673 --> 00:02:23,375
You can put that down now.

32
00:02:35,221 --> 00:02:37,156
I have to go.

33
00:03:13,426 --> 00:03:15,460
Photographs don't lie.

34
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:20,432
In a darkroom,
film comes to life.

35
00:03:24,404 --> 00:03:28,407
The filters and paper,
an image appears,

36
00:03:28,409 --> 00:03:30,642
capturing a moment in time.

37
00:03:32,213 --> 00:03:35,914
What happens before
and after that moment?

38
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:37,683
That can unnerve me.

39
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:40,219
Check the bag.

40
00:03:41,454 --> 00:03:42,921
Is it there?

41
00:03:42,923 --> 00:03:44,623
No, it's not.

42
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:46,358
You think you're better
than us, huh, retard?

43
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,293
And now you take a
picture of my girl?

44
00:03:48,295 --> 00:03:50,696
Only in the hallway.
She wanted to pose.

45
00:03:50,698 --> 00:03:53,232
You'll never take a picture
of my girlfriend again!

46
00:03:53,234 --> 00:03:57,436
Don't look at her! Don't even talk to her!
You got that, scumbag?

47
00:03:57,438 --> 00:03:59,438
Crippled piece of shit.

48
00:04:03,877 --> 00:04:04,876
Dad?

49
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:08,347
Dad, I'm home!

50
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:28,867
I gotta go.

51
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:33,405
I'll see you later.

52
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:35,067
Thanks.

53
00:05:35,069 --> 00:05:36,668
Bye.

54
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:40,038
Hey, let me get
two packs of Marlboros.

55
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,074
Get your sorry
little asses out of here.

56
00:05:42,076 --> 00:05:44,376
You think we're
gonna break the law?

57
00:05:44,378 --> 00:05:46,611
Hey, you see this?

58
00:05:46,613 --> 00:05:48,580
Don't you criminals
know how to read?

59
00:05:48,582 --> 00:05:50,582
It says you gotta be 18, see?

60
00:05:50,584 --> 00:05:51,883
What's your problem, lady?

61
00:05:51,885 --> 00:05:53,618
- My problem?
- Yeah.

62
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,487
Oh, Charles, hold me back.

63
00:05:55,489 --> 00:05:57,356
I'm gonna get myself
thrown in the slammer again.

64
00:05:57,358 --> 00:05:58,557
You're crazy.

65
00:05:58,559 --> 00:06:00,592
Come here,
you little piece of shit.

66
00:06:00,594 --> 00:06:01,960
Come here! Come here!

67
00:06:01,962 --> 00:06:04,363
Man!

68
00:06:04,365 --> 00:06:05,897
Yes!

69
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:08,667
Oh, there's only one thing
worse than little punks.

70
00:06:08,669 --> 00:06:09,835
What's that?

71
00:06:09,837 --> 00:06:11,570
Truck drivers
who try to pick up

72
00:06:11,572 --> 00:06:14,072
pretty middle-age
convenience store owners.

73
00:06:15,908 --> 00:06:18,143
Hi.

74
00:06:18,145 --> 00:06:19,711
Hey.

75
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:23,949
Your friend's here.

76
00:06:23,951 --> 00:06:25,617
Shh.

77
00:06:25,619 --> 00:06:27,352
Is a pretty little thing.

78
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:30,889
Yeah, she's really pretty.

79
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:32,090
Mm-hmm.

80
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,968
It's, um, 25 cents, hon.

81
00:06:46,606 --> 00:06:47,939
You can keep it.

82
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:51,410
Uh, thank... thank you.

83
00:06:51,412 --> 00:06:52,677
Bye.

84
00:06:52,679 --> 00:06:53,812
Bye.

85
00:06:55,615 --> 00:06:58,550
Hey, it's okay
to have a crush on her.

86
00:06:58,552 --> 00:06:59,751
Oh, Peg! Come on.

87
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:01,653
No. Hey, I can tell, angel.

88
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:06,825
Hey, Vicki!

89
00:07:06,827 --> 00:07:10,061
So the theme could be
anything you like.

90
00:07:10,063 --> 00:07:13,799
Well, let's remember to keep some
clothes on our subjects, okay?

91
00:07:15,502 --> 00:07:17,068
- Ryan.
- But, Mr. Sullivan,

92
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:19,838
what if they want
to take their clothes off?

93
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:23,608
Now if anyone wants
to enter the contest,

94
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:27,646
here. Pick up one of these
applications as you leave.

95
00:07:37,657 --> 00:07:40,125
Just let me know. Just... No...

96
00:07:51,571 --> 00:07:53,872
I had the bat, and I was like...

97
00:07:53,874 --> 00:07:56,708
I was like, "Leave her alone."

98
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:59,811
It was... It was insane.

99
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:02,247
Wh-What was her name again?

100
00:08:02,249 --> 00:08:04,049
- Vicki.
- Vicki?

101
00:08:04,051 --> 00:08:05,784
Yeah. She kind of like...

102
00:08:05,786 --> 00:08:09,254
Truck stop's like her...
like her hangout...

103
00:08:09,256 --> 00:08:10,522
Hmm. or...

104
00:08:12,258 --> 00:08:15,794
You know, when I went out there,
I felt like a regular guy,

105
00:08:15,796 --> 00:08:19,931
I mean, like I did what... I did
what most guys would do, you know.

106
00:08:19,933 --> 00:08:22,601
Hmm. Well,
actually, I think, uh...

107
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:27,272
Listen, most guys would not
have done what you did.

108
00:08:27,274 --> 00:08:29,007
I'm proud of you.

109
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:37,115
Well, it did feel pretty good.

110
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:43,121
When I went back inside,
I felt like an alien again.

111
00:08:53,734 --> 00:08:55,834
Hey, Charles, uh,

112
00:08:55,836 --> 00:08:57,569
we are gonna have
to start talk...

113
00:08:57,571 --> 00:08:58,803
Stop.

114
00:09:12,184 --> 00:09:14,052
What do you want now?

115
00:09:15,955 --> 00:09:17,255
Oh, I just... I just came by

116
00:09:17,257 --> 00:09:19,558
to just see how you're doing.

117
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:22,827
Anyway, last night...

118
00:09:22,829 --> 00:09:24,629
Last night, I was...

119
00:09:24,631 --> 00:09:27,132
I was a little bit
out of control, huh?

120
00:09:27,134 --> 00:09:29,768
Yeah. You were losing it.

121
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:31,736
Yeah.

122
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:33,805
Can I come in?

123
00:09:33,807 --> 00:09:35,540
No.

124
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:39,371
What you fucking thinking?

125
00:09:42,848 --> 00:09:43,848
I'm sorry.

126
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:45,550
What do you want?

127
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:50,922
I don't know.

128
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:53,158
I just want to make up.

129
00:09:56,729 --> 00:09:59,230
Can we just kiss
and make up now?

130
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:02,601
Come on.

131
00:10:02,603 --> 00:10:04,135
We're good, okay?

132
00:10:04,137 --> 00:10:05,136
Mm-hmm.

133
00:10:05,138 --> 00:10:07,072
I'm good.

134
00:10:07,074 --> 00:10:08,173
Hmm? Yeah.

135
00:10:08,175 --> 00:10:11,176
You want to get a beer? Yeah?

136
00:10:11,178 --> 00:10:13,678
- Can I get you a beer?
- Yeah.

137
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,647
Okay.

138
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:31,730
You know I could take
all this away from you, right?

139
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:36,334
Yeah. Yeah, I know that.

140
00:10:40,072 --> 00:10:42,807
But then what
would I do without you?

141
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:45,076
I don't know. I don't know.

142
00:11:01,695 --> 00:11:03,428
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

143
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,367
Oh, angel, have I ever told you

144
00:11:09,369 --> 00:11:11,136
how much I love making coffee?

145
00:11:11,138 --> 00:11:13,271
Yeah, only about
a million times.

146
00:11:13,273 --> 00:11:15,674
I have got it
down to a science.

147
00:11:15,676 --> 00:11:17,842
One rounded tablespoon per cup.

148
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:19,811
Not mug, cup.

149
00:11:19,813 --> 00:11:22,047
And I only use this tablespoon.

150
00:11:22,049 --> 00:11:25,083
You should throw that thing
out or at least wash it.

151
00:11:25,085 --> 00:11:26,317
Someone's gonna get sick.

152
00:11:26,319 --> 00:11:28,386
Darlin', have you
lost your mind?

153
00:11:28,388 --> 00:11:30,855
This here is Grammy Ev's
sterling silver,

154
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:33,925
and it makes the perfect
cup, and you know it,

155
00:11:33,927 --> 00:11:36,961
because you love
my coffee. Admit it!

156
00:11:36,963 --> 00:11:38,463
I know. I know.

157
00:11:38,465 --> 00:11:40,699
It'd be easier just to
pour in the grounds.

158
00:11:40,701 --> 00:11:43,702
Well, speed's not gonna
make it turn out good.

159
00:11:43,704 --> 00:11:46,171
Anyway, this is an art,
believe me.

160
00:11:46,173 --> 00:11:48,406
You've had
your dad's coffee, right?

161
00:11:48,408 --> 00:11:51,142
Ugh. It's worse than Sanka.

162
00:11:51,144 --> 00:11:53,244
Well, hello.

163
00:11:53,246 --> 00:11:54,946
Look who's here. You know,

164
00:11:54,948 --> 00:11:57,148
some men just can't take a hint

165
00:11:57,150 --> 00:12:00,685
that a lady is not interested.

166
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:04,089
Heh. Hey, there, Charles.

167
00:12:04,091 --> 00:12:05,824
Hey, Jack.

168
00:12:05,826 --> 00:12:07,926
Hello, sunshine.

169
00:12:07,928 --> 00:12:09,294
Now, Jack...

170
00:12:09,296 --> 00:12:10,295
She'll come around.

171
00:12:10,297 --> 00:12:12,263
I hope so.

172
00:12:12,265 --> 00:12:16,234
Is that Jack Campbell trying
to act all sweet again?

173
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:18,870
Ooh. Ho ho.

174
00:12:18,872 --> 00:12:21,206
Now, there are
those crystal-green eyes

175
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:24,943
that I have been just dreaming
about since Jacksonville.

176
00:12:24,945 --> 00:12:26,066
They're hazel, actually.

177
00:12:27,446 --> 00:12:28,813
For you, ma'am.

178
00:12:28,815 --> 00:12:30,815
Oh, roses. How imaginative.

179
00:12:30,817 --> 00:12:32,951
There you go.

180
00:12:32,953 --> 00:12:35,353
Boy, you are one tough cookie.

181
00:12:35,355 --> 00:12:37,155
You know that, sunshine?

182
00:12:37,157 --> 00:12:39,858
You know, you can buy me all
the flowers in California.

183
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:41,726
I'm still not
going out with you.

184
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:47,398
Jack, I have learned a
few things in my life.

185
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,399
Have you, now?

186
00:12:48,401 --> 00:12:49,434
Oh, yeah, yeah.

187
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:51,069
20 years as a hairdresser,

188
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:53,371
I think, qualifies me
as an expert on people.

189
00:12:53,373 --> 00:12:55,073
- I like your hair.
- Three divorces,

190
00:12:55,075 --> 00:12:58,076
I think that qualifies
me as an expert on men.

191
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:00,845
And one trucker husband
who dragged me

192
00:13:00,847 --> 00:13:02,847
to this shithole of a town

193
00:13:02,849 --> 00:13:06,184
definitely qualifies me
as an expert on truckers,

194
00:13:06,186 --> 00:13:08,419
so hit the road, Jack.

195
00:13:08,421 --> 00:13:10,221
One dance.

196
00:13:10,223 --> 00:13:12,290
Baby, you just
give me one dance,

197
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:16,161
and I will erase every bad
thought you ever had about men.

198
00:13:16,163 --> 00:13:17,428
Oh, yes, I will.

199
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:18,429
That's right, Charles.

200
00:13:18,431 --> 00:13:20,498
Ooh, like a cat.

201
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,433
Light on my feet, baby. No.

202
00:13:22,435 --> 00:13:25,236
Look at these moves, huh, baby.

203
00:13:25,238 --> 00:13:27,372
A little dip right there.

204
00:13:27,374 --> 00:13:30,074
Oh, yeah, I may be stocky,

205
00:13:30,076 --> 00:13:33,378
but I am agile.

206
00:13:45,591 --> 00:13:46,591
Hi.

207
00:13:46,593 --> 00:13:47,992
Hi.

208
00:13:49,061 --> 00:13:52,831
It's a quiet night, huh?

209
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:55,099
Yeah. Um...

210
00:13:55,101 --> 00:13:57,602
it's pretty late.

211
00:13:57,604 --> 00:14:00,371
Yeah.

212
00:14:00,373 --> 00:14:02,507
You want a cup of coffee?

213
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:04,409
Sure.

214
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:08,947
Half and half
with three sugars, please.

215
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:25,263
It's perfect.

216
00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:32,370
It's really good.

217
00:14:33,105 --> 00:14:35,373
No, no, no. It's on the house.

218
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:37,308
Oh.

219
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:39,277
Thank you.

220
00:14:44,984 --> 00:14:46,517
Gonna go.

221
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:48,086
Heh. Bye.

222
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:19,143
So, did you enter that
photo contest at school?

223
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:22,413
Nah. I'm still trying
to come up with a theme.

224
00:16:22,415 --> 00:16:25,183
Kevin always said you took
your best shots outside.

225
00:16:25,185 --> 00:16:27,185
I don't know. I'm not
even sure I'm gonna enter.

226
00:16:27,187 --> 00:16:29,320
I'm telling you, Charles.

227
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:30,521
One day...

228
00:16:30,523 --> 00:16:32,724
- I know. Stardom.
- Stardom. Stardom.

229
00:16:32,726 --> 00:16:34,592
Hey, remember those...
remember those shots

230
00:16:34,594 --> 00:16:37,362
you took of me
on my Harley with Kevin?

231
00:16:37,364 --> 00:16:38,563
Those?

232
00:16:38,565 --> 00:16:39,564
Oh, yeah.

233
00:16:39,566 --> 00:16:41,065
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

234
00:16:41,067 --> 00:16:42,066
I still have those.

235
00:16:42,068 --> 00:16:44,002
Yeah, it was... Yeah.

236
00:16:44,004 --> 00:16:46,537
Oh, you used to love
riding, didn't you?

237
00:16:46,539 --> 00:16:49,707
Oh, man, I felt alive
on my bike.

238
00:16:52,277 --> 00:16:55,613
Yeah, I wouldn't mind
having that feeling again.

239
00:16:59,119 --> 00:17:01,185
Look, I am losing fuel fast.

240
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:02,220
I might just... I'm gonna crash.

241
00:17:02,222 --> 00:17:03,421
Okay? Mm.

242
00:17:03,423 --> 00:17:05,256
Time to get you to bed, cowboy.

243
00:17:05,258 --> 00:17:06,657
I got him. I got him.

244
00:17:06,659 --> 00:17:08,092
All right. Come on.

245
00:17:08,094 --> 00:17:10,628
All right. Thanks.

246
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:12,397
You sure you don't wanna
eat something else?

247
00:17:12,399 --> 00:17:13,531
- No, no. Thanks.
- All right.

248
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:15,700
Good night, Charles.

249
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:17,301
Night, Dad.

250
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:21,672
Careful.

251
00:17:21,674 --> 00:17:23,408
Cold.

252
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:36,487
Can you believe Jack? I'm telling
you, I can't stop thinking about him.

253
00:17:36,489 --> 00:17:38,523
The man just never gives up.

254
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:41,359
I thought you
were done with men.

255
00:17:41,361 --> 00:17:43,561
Oh, I... I am, angel. I am. I am.

256
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:45,296
He's not gonna fool me.
Don't worry.

257
00:17:45,298 --> 00:17:47,365
They're all sweet and lovey
at the beginning,

258
00:17:47,367 --> 00:17:49,801
and then they turn into Mr. Hyde
right before your very eyes.

259
00:17:49,803 --> 00:17:51,669
Well, I don't get my
hopes too high either.

260
00:17:51,671 --> 00:17:53,471
Oh, come on. Don't say that.

261
00:17:55,707 --> 00:17:57,442
What? Girls don't like me.

262
00:17:57,444 --> 00:17:58,576
What are you talking about?

263
00:17:58,578 --> 00:18:00,311
You just haven't met enough.

264
00:18:00,313 --> 00:18:02,080
It's too early to give up.

265
00:18:02,082 --> 00:18:03,748
You gotta be old
and wrinkled like me.

266
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,783
Then you can be cynical, okay?

267
00:18:05,785 --> 00:18:07,318
- Okay.
- Okay.

268
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,487
"Girls don't like me"?

269
00:18:09,489 --> 00:18:11,789
- Girls don't like me.
- Oh, come on.

270
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:13,458
They will. Trust me.

271
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:15,193
They'll knock down your door.

272
00:18:15,195 --> 00:18:17,161
- Right.
- They are.

273
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:20,631
Yeah, right.

274
00:19:10,282 --> 00:19:12,750
- Hi.
- Hi.

275
00:19:12,752 --> 00:19:13,818
What's going on?

276
00:19:15,287 --> 00:19:16,554
Nothing.

277
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:19,824
What's that?

278
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:21,325
It's nothing. Just...

279
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:23,828
Well, it looks like something.
Let me see.

280
00:19:25,597 --> 00:19:27,231
It's really nothing.

281
00:19:27,233 --> 00:19:30,134
I didn't know
you were a photographer.

282
00:19:31,203 --> 00:19:33,871
I'm... I'm not.

283
00:19:35,608 --> 00:19:38,376
It says here it's
a photography contest.

284
00:19:41,814 --> 00:19:44,549
It's just more
of a hobby kind of.

285
00:19:44,551 --> 00:19:46,584
- A hobby, huh?
- Yeah.

286
00:19:46,586 --> 00:19:50,555
So what are you gonna take pictures
of for your hobby contest?

287
00:19:51,957 --> 00:19:54,892
Well, I was thinking, um,

288
00:19:54,894 --> 00:19:57,628
if I do end up
entering the contest,

289
00:19:57,630 --> 00:20:00,398
that I would... I would do the
California lighthouses.

290
00:20:02,267 --> 00:20:04,702
That's cool. It's really cool.

291
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:08,206
Yeah.

292
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:09,974
One major problem, though.

293
00:20:09,976 --> 00:20:12,710
I... I really need
a ride to get there,

294
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:13,978
and I can't drive, and...

295
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,213
What if I take you?

296
00:20:16,782 --> 00:20:19,917
What? No, that's not
what I was driving at.

297
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:21,686
I know.

298
00:20:21,688 --> 00:20:23,654
I want to.

299
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:26,958
What about tomorrow?

300
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,794
It's a Sunday.
I'm free during the day.

301
00:20:29,796 --> 00:20:31,896
Plus, I kind of
owe you one. Heh.

302
00:20:31,898 --> 00:20:34,232
Heh.

303
00:20:34,234 --> 00:20:35,399
Okay.

304
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:39,270
Cool. Where do you live?

305
00:20:39,272 --> 00:20:42,840
Um, um...

306
00:20:42,842 --> 00:20:44,508
where do I live?

307
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:47,812
Forest... Forest Road, the
last house on the left.

308
00:20:49,448 --> 00:20:51,349
Cool. I'll pick you up,
like, 11:00?

309
00:20:51,351 --> 00:20:53,217
Yeah. Yeah, that's perfect.

310
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:55,319
Great.

311
00:20:55,321 --> 00:20:56,487
Great.

312
00:20:56,489 --> 00:20:57,722
Yeah. I'll see you at 11:00.

313
00:20:57,724 --> 00:20:59,690
Thank you.

314
00:21:28,821 --> 00:21:30,955
What kind of music you into?

315
00:21:32,558 --> 00:21:34,425
Oh, I don't really
listen to music too much,

316
00:21:34,427 --> 00:21:37,528
but I like everything.

317
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:38,729
Country's pretty good.

318
00:21:38,731 --> 00:21:40,998
My dad played a lot of country.

319
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,669
Sometimes I go to the Cowboy
Palace with Peg and her friends.

320
00:21:44,671 --> 00:21:46,504
It's that country club
down on South Street.

321
00:21:46,506 --> 00:21:48,005
- Yeah.
- Um...

322
00:21:48,007 --> 00:21:51,008
Peg knows the bouncer,
so I get in without a problem,

323
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:53,511
and he didn't mind, 'cause
he knows I don't drink.

324
00:21:53,513 --> 00:21:54,979
You don't drink?

325
00:21:54,981 --> 00:21:58,349
I have enough trouble
walking when I'm sober.

326
00:21:58,351 --> 00:21:59,884
How old are you?

327
00:21:59,886 --> 00:22:01,919
17. How old are you?

328
00:22:01,921 --> 00:22:03,587
I just turned 18.

329
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:10,461
I think country's cool.

330
00:22:10,463 --> 00:22:12,763
I prefer harder stuff, though.

331
00:22:12,765 --> 00:22:15,433
I went to a couple
of concerts with Skid

332
00:22:15,435 --> 00:22:18,002
before I realized he was
a complete lunatic.

333
00:22:18,004 --> 00:22:19,370
Yeah.

334
00:22:21,406 --> 00:22:22,640
Anyway...

335
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:35,553
I haven't been outside in
the daytime for while.

336
00:22:35,555 --> 00:22:37,888
I usually like to sleep late

337
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:39,623
and stay in till nighttime.

338
00:22:41,927 --> 00:22:44,061
Why don't you go out?

339
00:22:46,965 --> 00:22:48,733
I don't know.

340
00:22:48,735 --> 00:22:51,736
I don't want people to see me,

341
00:22:51,738 --> 00:22:53,704
what I look like and all.

342
00:23:04,717 --> 00:23:05,950
Want to take a look?

343
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:16,160
Who's Kevin?

344
00:23:16,162 --> 00:23:17,528
My older brother.

345
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:20,765
This is his camera
and his stuff.

346
00:23:20,767 --> 00:23:22,666
Where's Kevin now?

347
00:23:23,702 --> 00:23:25,669
He died.

348
00:23:26,171 --> 00:23:27,171
I'm so sorry.

349
00:23:27,173 --> 00:23:29,407
No, it's okay.

350
00:23:33,545 --> 00:23:35,513
What about your mom?

351
00:23:37,449 --> 00:23:40,651
My mom left when I was
only a couple years old,

352
00:23:40,653 --> 00:23:41,719
just started to walk.

353
00:23:41,721 --> 00:23:43,120
At least, tried to walk.

354
00:23:43,122 --> 00:23:44,989
Why'd she leave?

355
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:48,058
Me.

356
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:52,463
So it's just you
and your dad now?

357
00:23:52,465 --> 00:23:54,465
Yeah, my dad's great.

358
00:23:54,467 --> 00:23:55,833
He's like my best friend.

359
00:23:55,835 --> 00:23:58,702
He's always encouraging
me and stuff.

360
00:23:58,704 --> 00:23:59,970
It's cool.

361
00:23:59,972 --> 00:24:01,639
- Yeah, that's cool.
- Yeah.

362
00:24:01,641 --> 00:24:03,207
Sounds like a good guy.

363
00:24:03,209 --> 00:24:07,111
What about you?
Do you have any family?

364
00:24:07,113 --> 00:24:08,746
Um...

365
00:24:10,715 --> 00:24:14,752
well, my dad's gone,
thankfully.

366
00:24:14,754 --> 00:24:16,787
And my mom...

367
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:19,990
I haven't seen her

368
00:24:19,992 --> 00:24:22,512
since she asked me to
hit the road, so...

369
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:29,033
You should probably
take the picture.

370
00:24:29,035 --> 00:24:31,001
We kind of have to go, right?

371
00:24:31,003 --> 00:24:33,003
Yeah.

372
00:24:56,194 --> 00:24:59,263
No, no, no! I am done
with men, remember?

373
00:24:59,265 --> 00:25:01,765
D-O-N-E, done.

374
00:25:01,767 --> 00:25:02,967
They're nothing but two-timing,

375
00:25:02,969 --> 00:25:05,035
always lying,
sex-addicted dogs.

376
00:25:05,037 --> 00:25:06,704
I don't mean you, sweetie.

377
00:25:06,706 --> 00:25:08,072
Well, I'm sex addicted, too.

378
00:25:08,074 --> 00:25:10,274
You know that.

379
00:25:10,276 --> 00:25:11,842
Hey, hey! May I remind you

380
00:25:11,844 --> 00:25:13,777
that we are sitting
with a very young,

381
00:25:13,779 --> 00:25:15,179
innocent young man here?

382
00:25:15,181 --> 00:25:17,141
Please, watch your
fuckin' language.

383
00:25:18,918 --> 00:25:20,818
Charles doesn't mind,
now, does he?

384
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:22,586
Am I right? Am I right?

385
00:25:22,588 --> 00:25:24,288
Like I was saying, guys,

386
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:25,789
men are nothing but trouble.

387
00:25:25,791 --> 00:25:27,057
- Oh, oh...
- Listen to me, girls.

388
00:25:27,059 --> 00:25:28,526
I know from where I speak.

389
00:25:28,528 --> 00:25:29,927
Oh, honey, there are still

390
00:25:29,929 --> 00:25:31,662
some good men out there,
fine men out there.

391
00:25:31,664 --> 00:25:33,597
Still some good men.

392
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:35,032
Well, I have met most
every man in this state,

393
00:25:35,034 --> 00:25:36,600
and I have yet
to find a good one.

394
00:25:36,602 --> 00:25:38,936
No! The entire state?

395
00:25:38,938 --> 00:25:40,671
Oh, she's exaggerating.

396
00:25:40,673 --> 00:25:42,840
You guys didn't know me
when I was younger.

397
00:25:42,842 --> 00:25:44,882
The entire state is
not an exaggeration.

398
00:25:46,612 --> 00:25:48,812
You might be telling the truth.

399
00:25:48,814 --> 00:25:50,615
Oh, let's go.
I wanna... Let's move.

400
00:25:52,818 --> 00:25:54,752
- Hey, Dottie. Dottie.
- Yes, ma'am.

401
00:25:54,754 --> 00:25:55,953
Did you forget to wear
your underwear again?

402
00:25:55,955 --> 00:25:57,688
Well, of course I did.

403
00:26:00,325 --> 00:26:02,192
Yee-haw!

404
00:26:05,764 --> 00:26:07,731
You okay?

405
00:26:22,013 --> 00:26:23,280
Dad!

406
00:26:23,282 --> 00:26:25,015
Dad! You okay?

407
00:26:25,017 --> 00:26:26,684
Yeah. Yeah.

408
00:26:26,686 --> 00:26:27,718
I'm all right.

409
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:44,268
You have fun?

410
00:26:45,837 --> 00:26:46,937
Yeah, I guess.

411
00:26:49,674 --> 00:26:51,141
Did you dance?

412
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:54,745
You know I can't do that.

413
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:36,253
Hey.

414
00:28:00,812 --> 00:28:02,713
Ah, there he is.

415
00:28:02,715 --> 00:28:03,881
Hey, Charles.

416
00:28:03,883 --> 00:28:05,449
Hey.

417
00:28:05,451 --> 00:28:06,450
Hi.

418
00:28:06,452 --> 00:28:07,951
Hey.

419
00:28:07,953 --> 00:28:10,254
Me and your dad
was just hanging out.

420
00:28:10,256 --> 00:28:12,856
Yeah, Vicki knows all
about cars and Harleys.

421
00:28:12,858 --> 00:28:14,992
Cool.

422
00:28:14,994 --> 00:28:18,462
I grew up being kind of a tomboy.
What can I say?

423
00:28:18,464 --> 00:28:20,764
And I love your dad's
Chevelle and Harley.

424
00:28:20,766 --> 00:28:21,865
They're the coolest.

425
00:28:25,371 --> 00:28:28,772
I figured we could go
to a lighthouse today.

426
00:28:48,861 --> 00:28:51,995
Can't believe how patient
you have to be to do this.

427
00:28:51,997 --> 00:28:53,430
That's what I love
about photography.

428
00:28:53,432 --> 00:28:56,266
Anything, really, if you
look at it long enough,

429
00:28:56,268 --> 00:28:58,802
you get to see what
it's really showing you.

430
00:29:04,175 --> 00:29:06,143
You know what I think, Charles?

431
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:11,448
I think you're like
one of your subjects.

432
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:14,351
You've got lots of faces
of your own to show.

433
00:29:18,823 --> 00:29:21,058
Why are you so nice to me?

434
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:24,461
Why shouldn't I be?

435
00:29:48,454 --> 00:29:49,887
I can't do that.

436
00:29:53,258 --> 00:29:54,758
Yes, you can.

437
00:30:16,247 --> 00:30:18,549
Okay.

438
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:21,218
You did.

439
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:22,286
Really.

440
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:37,968
Whoo!

441
00:30:40,872 --> 00:30:42,406
I'm gonna take your picture.

442
00:30:42,408 --> 00:30:44,842
- No.
- Ah, come on, smile.

443
00:30:44,844 --> 00:30:46,376
Please don't, no.

444
00:30:46,378 --> 00:30:48,145
- Yeah, come on, smile.
- No, please, don't. Please.

445
00:30:48,147 --> 00:30:49,907
- Charles, come on.
- Stop!

446
00:31:04,429 --> 00:31:07,397
I think it's really cool
you're so into photography.

447
00:31:15,106 --> 00:31:17,541
I remember when I was a kid,

448
00:31:17,543 --> 00:31:21,311
after I found out that girls
didn't play for the Dodgers,

449
00:31:21,313 --> 00:31:25,148
I got totally into the news,

450
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:27,184
and I started walking around

451
00:31:27,186 --> 00:31:29,920
with a tape recorder
and a microphone,

452
00:31:29,922 --> 00:31:33,323
interviewing my mom and dad
and my little sisters.

453
00:31:37,595 --> 00:31:40,063
I was really into it.

454
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:45,168
I remember I wanted to be
one of those reporters

455
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:46,637
that goes right into the scene

456
00:31:46,639 --> 00:31:48,399
of the crime or the accident.

457
00:31:50,541 --> 00:31:53,243
I wanted to tell
whoever was in trouble

458
00:31:53,245 --> 00:31:57,114
or whoever had escaped the fire

459
00:31:57,116 --> 00:31:59,950
or whoever's kid
had disappeared

460
00:31:59,952 --> 00:32:02,452
that everything
was gonna be okay...

461
00:32:04,956 --> 00:32:07,958
that it was all gonna
be okay, you know.

462
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:15,899
And what have I got now?

463
00:32:27,178 --> 00:32:31,014
Vicki, can I ask you
something personal?

464
00:32:31,016 --> 00:32:32,115
Sure.

465
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:41,692
How'd you become a...

466
00:32:41,694 --> 00:32:43,593
Heh.

467
00:32:43,595 --> 00:32:45,262
Sorry, I don't know...

468
00:32:45,264 --> 00:32:46,730
No, it's okay.

469
00:32:46,732 --> 00:32:49,666
It's my life. Shit.

470
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:54,137
Uh, well...

471
00:32:56,007 --> 00:32:59,543
my asshole father used to
like to take his bullshit out

472
00:32:59,545 --> 00:33:02,546
on my mom and me
and my little sisters.

473
00:33:02,548 --> 00:33:06,350
One day, he just disappeared,
never came back.

474
00:33:08,619 --> 00:33:11,755
I actually managed fine,
even when my mom

475
00:33:11,757 --> 00:33:14,624
was bringing a different
guy home every night.

476
00:33:16,294 --> 00:33:18,762
Then one boyfriend moved in,

477
00:33:18,764 --> 00:33:21,231
and he took a liking
to me real fast,

478
00:33:21,233 --> 00:33:22,466
so she kicked us out.

479
00:33:22,468 --> 00:33:24,368
He went his way,
and I met Skid,

480
00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:26,010
and that's pretty much it.

481
00:33:40,651 --> 00:33:42,686
How come you chose
to take pictures

482
00:33:42,688 --> 00:33:44,755
of lighthouses
for your contest?

483
00:33:44,757 --> 00:33:46,623
Well, one day I remembered
that Kevin and I

484
00:33:46,625 --> 00:33:48,392
had planned to do
a road trip one summer

485
00:33:48,394 --> 00:33:50,260
to photograph the
lighthouses of California.

486
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:56,099
He really liked the idea of the
light guiding people home.

487
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:02,706
Guess you could say my brother
liked helping people a lot.

488
00:34:04,609 --> 00:34:06,676
How did he die?

489
00:34:06,678 --> 00:34:08,145
Vietnam.

490
00:34:08,147 --> 00:34:11,114
Shit, that's awful.

491
00:34:11,116 --> 00:34:13,150
He was a hero,

492
00:34:13,152 --> 00:34:15,218
even won a medal.

493
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:17,120
Wow.

494
00:34:22,326 --> 00:34:24,628
It's really cool
that you're doing

495
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:26,329
this lighthouse trip with me.

496
00:34:29,267 --> 00:34:31,301
I think it's really cool, too.

497
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:47,818
How's the project
going with Vicki?

498
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:49,119
Okay, I guess.

499
00:34:49,121 --> 00:34:50,687
I got some good shots. Yeah?

500
00:34:50,689 --> 00:34:52,589
Vicki's been helping out a lot.

501
00:34:52,591 --> 00:34:55,759
Eh, Charles, you ask me,
I think she likes you.

502
00:34:57,395 --> 00:34:59,329
She just feels bad for me.

503
00:34:59,331 --> 00:35:00,464
Ah, come on, Charles.

504
00:35:00,466 --> 00:35:02,732
I see how she is with you.

505
00:35:02,734 --> 00:35:04,768
She likes being around you.

506
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:06,336
I don't know.

507
00:35:06,338 --> 00:35:08,171
Sure.

508
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:11,808
What grade is she in, anyway?

509
00:35:15,213 --> 00:35:16,713
She didn't tell you?

510
00:35:16,715 --> 00:35:20,684
No. We just talked about
cars and motorcycles.

511
00:35:23,254 --> 00:35:24,788
She works at the truck stop.

512
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:28,291
What do you mean, "She
works at the truck stop"?

513
00:35:28,293 --> 00:35:30,894
She "works" at the truck stop.

514
00:35:34,365 --> 00:35:36,566
Are you okay with that?

515
00:35:36,568 --> 00:35:38,368
Are you okay with that?

516
00:35:40,705 --> 00:35:43,673
I think so.

517
00:35:43,675 --> 00:35:45,809
I like her.

518
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:50,580
I like her, too, Charles.

519
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:31,688
Stay away from him, Charles.

520
00:36:32,723 --> 00:36:37,227
Whoo! Whoo!

521
00:36:45,603 --> 00:36:47,637
It's the gimp.

522
00:36:47,639 --> 00:36:49,206
What's in the bag?

523
00:36:49,208 --> 00:36:50,340
Not your treasured camera?

524
00:36:50,342 --> 00:36:52,842
Oh, no.

525
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:55,879
Oh, where you going, huh?

526
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:00,183
Huh?

527
00:37:07,491 --> 00:37:09,793
Who the fuck are you?

528
00:37:09,795 --> 00:37:10,994
Who the fuck are you?

529
00:37:10,996 --> 00:37:13,430
Heh. I'm your worst nightmare.

530
00:37:13,432 --> 00:37:14,898
Heh.

531
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:17,601
I don't think you know
me very well, do you?

532
00:37:17,603 --> 00:37:19,369
Let's go, Charles. Come on.

533
00:37:20,504 --> 00:37:23,006
Excuse me, girlie.

534
00:37:23,008 --> 00:37:25,875
We ain't done talking to our
friend, Charles, just yet.

535
00:37:25,877 --> 00:37:27,577
Right, boys?

536
00:37:27,579 --> 00:37:31,481
Now why don't you run along
before you get hurt?

537
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:37,454
Charles is coming with me.

538
00:37:42,526 --> 00:37:44,166
Don't fuck with him again.

539
00:37:48,299 --> 00:37:50,333
I may not be the best shot,

540
00:37:50,335 --> 00:37:52,136
but I usually hit something.

541
00:37:52,837 --> 00:37:54,938
Even if it's small.

542
00:38:04,682 --> 00:38:06,783
That was great.

543
00:38:06,785 --> 00:38:09,552
That would have made
the perfect photo.

544
00:38:09,554 --> 00:38:12,889
You should have done your
project on high school pussies.

545
00:38:16,962 --> 00:38:19,029
Where'd you get the gun?

546
00:38:19,031 --> 00:38:20,363
From Skid.

547
00:38:21,899 --> 00:38:25,835
Heh. Wait. How'd you
get my dad's car?

548
00:38:25,837 --> 00:38:27,470
I asked.

549
00:38:33,911 --> 00:38:35,645
Hey, grab the wheel.

550
00:38:35,647 --> 00:38:37,614
What? Why?

551
00:38:37,616 --> 00:38:40,417
Grab the wheel.

552
00:38:40,419 --> 00:38:43,520
You can't drive a convertible

553
00:38:43,522 --> 00:38:46,656
and not stand and feel
the wind in your hair!

554
00:38:46,658 --> 00:38:47,824
Whoo!

555
00:38:49,428 --> 00:38:51,361
Wow.

556
00:38:52,963 --> 00:38:55,532
Okay, it's your turn.

557
00:38:55,534 --> 00:38:56,533
Me?

558
00:38:56,535 --> 00:38:58,601
Yeah. Come on.

559
00:38:58,603 --> 00:38:59,636
Stand up.

560
00:39:03,641 --> 00:39:05,508
- You can do it.
- All right.

561
00:39:09,981 --> 00:39:12,015
Yeah!

562
00:39:12,017 --> 00:39:13,783
- Raise your arms.
- I can't.

563
00:39:13,785 --> 00:39:15,552
Yeah, you can.

564
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:19,389
Ahh!

565
00:39:19,391 --> 00:39:20,857
Whoo!

566
00:39:20,859 --> 00:39:23,493
Whoo-hoo!

567
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:48,151
How long have you lived here?

568
00:39:48,153 --> 00:39:49,619
Like six months now.

569
00:39:49,621 --> 00:39:51,154
Skid set me up here.

570
00:39:51,156 --> 00:39:54,591
Mm, he likes to know
where he can find me.

571
00:39:59,797 --> 00:40:01,398
Who are they?

572
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,767
Those are my little sisters.

573
00:40:03,769 --> 00:40:05,168
Cute.

574
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:07,370
Yeah.

575
00:40:44,141 --> 00:40:45,408
Whoa.

576
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:50,647
I'm... I'm so sorry.

577
00:40:50,649 --> 00:40:54,884
I didn't... I don't know
what I'm doing anymore.

578
00:41:25,517 --> 00:41:27,050
Community college is
a great place to start.

579
00:41:27,052 --> 00:41:29,085
I could take photography?

580
00:41:29,087 --> 00:41:31,447
Sure. Your photography
work, it holds promise.

581
00:41:32,957 --> 00:41:35,492
You think you could help me
with an admission application?

582
00:41:35,494 --> 00:41:36,893
Absolutely.

583
00:41:36,895 --> 00:41:38,862
You know, Charles,

584
00:41:38,864 --> 00:41:41,664
I am so thrilled that you are
starting to believe in yourself.

585
00:41:41,666 --> 00:41:43,766
It's just great.

586
00:41:43,768 --> 00:41:45,735
Thanks.

587
00:42:06,657 --> 00:42:09,859
You and Vicki are spending a
lot of time together, huh?

588
00:42:10,896 --> 00:42:12,262
Yeah.

589
00:42:12,264 --> 00:42:15,198
Maybe we should talk
about relationships,

590
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,634
you know, boyfriend,
girlfriend stuff.

591
00:42:17,636 --> 00:42:19,202
Not now, Dad.

592
00:42:19,204 --> 00:42:21,004
Come on. Help me look
through these photos.

593
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:26,943
Charles, we still
have to talk about

594
00:42:26,945 --> 00:42:28,978
what's gonna happen
when I'm gone.

595
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:31,214
Wait. What do you think
of these two?

596
00:42:35,586 --> 00:42:37,053
I think they're great.

597
00:42:37,055 --> 00:42:38,688
Yeah?

598
00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:40,690
Yeah, these two are winners.

599
00:42:48,766 --> 00:42:49,899
Hey, sweetie.

600
00:42:49,901 --> 00:42:52,168
We were just talking about you.

601
00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:54,270
Were those pretty little
ears of yours burning?

602
00:42:54,272 --> 00:42:56,739
What were you saying?

603
00:42:56,741 --> 00:42:57,974
Go on.

604
00:42:57,976 --> 00:42:59,008
What?

605
00:43:00,978 --> 00:43:02,946
Well, uh, we were
all gonna go dancing

606
00:43:02,948 --> 00:43:04,714
tomorrow night
at the Cowboy Palace,

607
00:43:04,716 --> 00:43:06,249
Me, Charles, and the girls.

608
00:43:06,251 --> 00:43:07,850
Jack here can't make it.

609
00:43:07,852 --> 00:43:11,187
But, um, we all were wondering

610
00:43:11,189 --> 00:43:12,589
if you'd like to come along.

611
00:43:12,591 --> 00:43:14,657
It is so much fun.

612
00:43:14,659 --> 00:43:15,658
Dancing?

613
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:16,893
Mm-hmm, tomorrow night.

614
00:43:20,765 --> 00:43:24,334
Okay, yeah. Sounds like fun.

615
00:43:24,336 --> 00:43:28,605
Really? That's great, huh?

616
00:43:28,607 --> 00:43:30,573
That'll be fun.

617
00:43:34,813 --> 00:43:37,180
You are a breath of fresh air.
You know that?

618
00:43:37,182 --> 00:43:38,181
No, thank you.

619
00:43:38,183 --> 00:43:39,248
This dress is adorable.

620
00:43:39,250 --> 00:43:40,717
You look so sweet, sugar.

621
00:43:40,719 --> 00:43:41,985
Thank you.

622
00:43:41,987 --> 00:43:43,019
Doesn't she look
beautiful, Charles?

623
00:43:43,021 --> 00:43:44,387
- Yeah.
- Girls,

624
00:43:44,389 --> 00:43:46,190
have you ever seen
such a pretty little thing?

625
00:43:46,191 --> 00:43:47,890
Never in my lifetime. Never.

626
00:43:47,892 --> 00:43:50,293
Vicki, angel, if I looked
like you 35 years ago,

627
00:43:50,295 --> 00:43:52,261
I would have found myself
a real man.

628
00:43:52,263 --> 00:43:54,397
Oh, you would have had
the pick of the bunch.

629
00:43:54,399 --> 00:43:57,200
It would still be
the best of a bad lot.

630
00:43:57,202 --> 00:44:00,136
I'd rather have that than the
slime buckets we ended up with.

631
00:44:01,306 --> 00:44:02,772
Uh-oh.

632
00:44:02,774 --> 00:44:05,341
Girls, do you hear that?

633
00:44:05,343 --> 00:44:07,710
Time to slow dance.

634
00:44:07,712 --> 00:44:09,012
Who do you guys dance with?

635
00:44:09,014 --> 00:44:10,680
Each other. We've
always wanted men

636
00:44:10,682 --> 00:44:12,348
who were as caring and
understanding as us,

637
00:44:12,350 --> 00:44:14,717
so half of us just
pretend to be those men.

638
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:16,185
All right, who's wearing
the pants tonight?

639
00:44:16,187 --> 00:44:17,687
Me. I did it last week.

640
00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:21,391
Oh, my.

641
00:44:34,906 --> 00:44:36,739
For what?

642
00:44:36,741 --> 00:44:38,441
To dance.

643
00:44:38,443 --> 00:44:39,442
Me?

644
00:44:39,444 --> 00:44:40,810
Yes!

645
00:44:40,812 --> 00:44:41,811
Uh...

646
00:44:41,813 --> 00:44:43,012
Come on. Come with me.

647
00:44:43,014 --> 00:44:45,114
- Oh...
- What?

648
00:45:46,344 --> 00:45:48,077
I'll knock if you don't.

649
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:51,013
Wait. Wait!
I'm not ready for this.

650
00:45:51,015 --> 00:45:52,782
Vicki, come on!
We're right here!

651
00:45:52,784 --> 00:45:53,850
No, no!

652
00:45:53,852 --> 00:45:55,718
No, please.

653
00:46:02,226 --> 00:46:04,026
Hi, Lois.

654
00:46:20,077 --> 00:46:22,345
Vicki, is it really you?

655
00:46:22,347 --> 00:46:24,247
Hi, kid. How's it going?

656
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:29,352
Charles, these are
my little sisters.

657
00:46:29,354 --> 00:46:30,787
This is Sharon,
and this is Kate.

658
00:46:30,789 --> 00:46:32,355
Hi. Hi.

659
00:46:32,357 --> 00:46:34,056
Hi.

660
00:46:35,392 --> 00:46:38,961
So what are you doing out here?

661
00:46:38,963 --> 00:46:41,397
Um, I've been
helping Charles out

662
00:46:41,399 --> 00:46:42,899
with his photography project.

663
00:46:42,901 --> 00:46:45,935
We were just in the area.

664
00:46:45,937 --> 00:46:49,038
- Are you really a pr...
- Kate.

665
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:58,047
So where are you living?

666
00:46:58,049 --> 00:46:59,382
Out in the desert.

667
00:46:59,384 --> 00:47:01,417
Are you coming home?

668
00:47:05,422 --> 00:47:07,590
How's school been?

669
00:47:07,592 --> 00:47:08,591
Fine.

670
00:47:08,593 --> 00:47:10,493
Yeah, it's okay.

671
00:47:12,162 --> 00:47:14,397
Well, it's...

672
00:47:14,399 --> 00:47:16,399
it's really good
to see you, Vicki.

673
00:47:18,268 --> 00:47:19,535
Do you mean that?

674
00:47:19,537 --> 00:47:22,038
Of course I mean that.

675
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:23,339
Isn't it, girls?

676
00:47:23,341 --> 00:47:25,174
Yeah.

677
00:47:25,176 --> 00:47:27,143
Yeah.

678
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:53,202
It's been...

679
00:47:53,204 --> 00:47:54,937
Well, let's see.

680
00:47:54,939 --> 00:47:57,039
We've known each other
for a few years now, right?

681
00:47:57,041 --> 00:47:58,074
Mm-hmm.

682
00:47:58,076 --> 00:47:59,475
Ever since I brought in

683
00:47:59,477 --> 00:48:02,144
my broken-down car into Sears.

684
00:48:02,146 --> 00:48:03,946
Good old Eric
fixed me up just fine.

685
00:48:05,550 --> 00:48:07,583
And then I met Charles,
and, well,

686
00:48:07,585 --> 00:48:09,218
he just completely
stole my heart.

687
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:11,888
- Well, what about me?
- Eh, you wish.

688
00:48:13,491 --> 00:48:14,957
Nope, Charles is, has been,

689
00:48:14,959 --> 00:48:16,659
and always will be
the only man for me.

690
00:48:16,661 --> 00:48:19,095
Peg got me the job
at the truck stop.

691
00:48:19,097 --> 00:48:21,163
Oh, really? That's cool.

692
00:48:22,566 --> 00:48:26,636
Yep. Vicki, you know,
um, Charles showed me

693
00:48:26,638 --> 00:48:29,005
a few pictures
that he took of you,

694
00:48:29,007 --> 00:48:31,173
and I'm telling you,
you could be a model.

695
00:48:31,175 --> 00:48:32,441
Me?

696
00:48:32,443 --> 00:48:34,043
Yeah.

697
00:48:34,045 --> 00:48:37,046
You, you are
the prettiest little thing.

698
00:48:37,048 --> 00:48:38,981
You do photograph very well.

699
00:48:38,983 --> 00:48:41,150
Your eyes are beautiful.

700
00:48:41,152 --> 00:48:42,385
Yeah.

701
00:48:44,656 --> 00:48:47,423
I think you guys are talking
about somebody else.

702
00:48:47,425 --> 00:48:49,425
No.

703
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:51,594
Hey, what about your parents?

704
00:48:51,596 --> 00:48:54,096
Are you close?

705
00:48:54,098 --> 00:48:56,232
Um...

706
00:48:56,234 --> 00:48:57,333
no.

707
00:48:57,335 --> 00:48:59,669
My mom used to tell me that I

708
00:48:59,671 --> 00:49:01,504
was a whole lot of trouble

709
00:49:01,506 --> 00:49:04,106
and that she didn't know how
to handle it, you know.

710
00:49:05,944 --> 00:49:08,010
I have two great
little sisters, though.

711
00:49:08,012 --> 00:49:11,147
It's... It's really great
to see you guys together.

712
00:49:11,149 --> 00:49:13,282
Yeah, I seriously
wouldn't have been able

713
00:49:13,284 --> 00:49:15,551
to do this project without you.

714
00:49:15,553 --> 00:49:17,286
Vicki, can I ask you something?

715
00:49:17,288 --> 00:49:19,255
Yeah.

716
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:24,961
Dad, I still really don't think
this is such a good idea.

717
00:49:24,963 --> 00:49:28,130
Charles, this cowboy
is riding again.

718
00:49:28,132 --> 00:49:29,565
Yes!

719
00:49:29,567 --> 00:49:31,167
Just don't go too fast, Vicki.

720
00:49:31,169 --> 00:49:33,450
Okay. I'll keep it under 100.

721
00:49:34,072 --> 00:49:35,137
Will you be careful, please?

722
00:49:35,139 --> 00:49:37,707
All right. Okay, hold on,

723
00:49:37,709 --> 00:49:41,143
and get ready for the
ride of your life!

724
00:49:41,145 --> 00:49:42,445
Kick it!

725
00:49:45,248 --> 00:49:47,216
Yeah!

726
00:50:15,412 --> 00:50:17,380
Hey, Truck Stop!

727
00:50:18,548 --> 00:50:20,649
Come here.

728
00:50:20,651 --> 00:50:22,618
Come here. Sit down. Sit down.

729
00:50:22,620 --> 00:50:24,487
We'll... We'll have
a little talk.

730
00:50:24,489 --> 00:50:26,422
We'll get to know each other
a little bit better.

731
00:50:26,424 --> 00:50:27,423
I gotta get to work.

732
00:50:27,425 --> 00:50:30,259
Work? Shit. Fuck work.

733
00:50:30,261 --> 00:50:32,194
They'll run your ass
right in the fuckin' ground.

734
00:50:32,196 --> 00:50:33,229
You know that?

735
00:50:33,231 --> 00:50:35,364
Come on!

736
00:50:35,366 --> 00:50:37,633
Sit down.

737
00:50:40,237 --> 00:50:42,772
You know I'm not
gonna hurt you, right?

738
00:50:42,774 --> 00:50:45,441
Just come on, and sit down.

739
00:50:45,443 --> 00:50:47,309
Hell, you might actually

740
00:50:47,311 --> 00:50:51,013
take a fuckin' swing at me
with that bat of yours.

741
00:50:55,819 --> 00:50:57,086
Smoke?

742
00:50:57,088 --> 00:50:58,087
No.

743
00:50:58,089 --> 00:50:59,455
Good.

744
00:50:59,457 --> 00:51:01,157
They'll fuckin' kill you.

745
00:51:03,226 --> 00:51:06,228
Where you live, Truck Stop?

746
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:09,632
Uh, just up the road a bit.

747
00:51:11,301 --> 00:51:14,270
Damn.

748
00:51:14,272 --> 00:51:17,139
That's a long way to walk with
that twitch of yours, isn't it?

749
00:51:17,141 --> 00:51:20,042
I don't mind. I like walking.

750
00:51:20,844 --> 00:51:21,844
Can't drive?

751
00:51:21,846 --> 00:51:23,145
Nah.

752
00:51:24,848 --> 00:51:26,382
Where your parents at?

753
00:51:27,517 --> 00:51:29,518
They just let you

754
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:31,220
fuckin' struggle along
like that?

755
00:51:33,790 --> 00:51:37,660
Um, well, my dad's
kind of sick,

756
00:51:37,662 --> 00:51:40,629
and, uh, my mom's not around.

757
00:51:40,631 --> 00:51:41,864
Where the fuck she go?

758
00:51:41,866 --> 00:51:43,632
She left us.

759
00:51:46,369 --> 00:51:48,637
Fuckin' whore.

760
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:55,478
What the fuck kind of mother
leaves her kid like that?

761
00:51:58,615 --> 00:52:02,651
You know, all women
are useless fuckin' whores.

762
00:52:02,653 --> 00:52:05,187
You know that, Truck Stop?

763
00:52:05,189 --> 00:52:08,791
My mom, she nearly starved
my ass every fuckin' week.

764
00:52:08,793 --> 00:52:11,794
Didn't even know
who the fuck my father was.

765
00:52:11,796 --> 00:52:15,464
She'd spread her legs for a hit
of acid whenever she could.

766
00:52:16,801 --> 00:52:20,269
I should have fuckin'
killed that bitch

767
00:52:20,271 --> 00:52:22,638
when I had the chance,
but I was...

768
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:25,374
I was too fuckin' nervous
in those days.

769
00:52:25,376 --> 00:52:26,408
Now...

770
00:52:29,212 --> 00:52:31,180
I don't have
that problem, buddy.

771
00:52:35,552 --> 00:52:37,686
Mm.

772
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:44,593
You know, Truck Stop,

773
00:52:44,595 --> 00:52:46,729
God damn, you and me...

774
00:52:48,198 --> 00:52:50,232
we're a lot alike.

775
00:52:50,234 --> 00:52:55,704
We get all the shit
that life has to give,

776
00:52:55,706 --> 00:52:57,773
all the shit in the world.

777
00:52:59,477 --> 00:53:00,743
Sad story, ain't it?

778
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:05,147
How's it going, eh?

779
00:53:08,285 --> 00:53:11,353
Aw, fuck it.

780
00:53:11,355 --> 00:53:12,354
Good talk.

781
00:53:12,356 --> 00:53:14,924
Good talk.

782
00:53:24,334 --> 00:53:27,169
I want you to do
something for me.

783
00:53:34,244 --> 00:53:35,277
Close your eyes.

784
00:53:35,279 --> 00:53:36,745
Huh?

785
00:53:38,248 --> 00:53:40,482
Close your eyes.

786
00:53:42,519 --> 00:53:47,256
Now picture yourself
in your dad's car...

787
00:53:48,725 --> 00:53:52,361
Just you and me
flying down the road,

788
00:53:52,363 --> 00:53:54,663
not a care in the world.

789
00:53:56,299 --> 00:53:58,834
Now you're standing up
just like we did.

790
00:53:58,836 --> 00:54:00,836
You remember that?

791
00:54:01,504 --> 00:54:02,905
Great.

792
00:54:04,574 --> 00:54:06,809
Feel the wind in your hair.

793
00:54:08,478 --> 00:54:10,546
You feel free,

794
00:54:10,548 --> 00:54:14,717
completely, totally free.

795
00:54:20,658 --> 00:54:22,791
That wasn't so hard, was it?

796
00:54:26,896 --> 00:54:29,598
I feel really lucky
to know you, Charles.

797
00:54:31,601 --> 00:54:34,837
When I think about what you...

798
00:54:34,839 --> 00:54:36,839
have to go through every day

799
00:54:36,841 --> 00:54:39,908
to get to work or school,

800
00:54:39,910 --> 00:54:42,978
when I see you
using this camera...

801
00:54:47,484 --> 00:54:50,953
makes me believe I can do
something with my life,

802
00:54:50,955 --> 00:54:52,488
truly.

803
00:54:55,325 --> 00:54:56,925
Thank you for that.

804
00:55:07,037 --> 00:55:09,438
I'm gonna miss this,

805
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:11,440
the lighthouses...

806
00:55:12,842 --> 00:55:14,576
coming up here.

807
00:55:20,917 --> 00:55:23,552
Maybe there'll be
another contest, though.

808
00:55:34,564 --> 00:55:36,332
Smile!

809
00:55:36,334 --> 00:55:39,468
No. It's about the
lighthouses, not me, Charles.

810
00:55:39,470 --> 00:55:40,736
Ready for your close-up?

811
00:55:40,738 --> 00:55:42,738
No. Heh heh.

812
00:55:47,077 --> 00:55:49,812
Remember that summer, Vicki?

813
00:55:49,814 --> 00:55:51,080
Yeah.

814
00:55:51,082 --> 00:55:52,448
That was fun.

815
00:55:52,450 --> 00:55:53,749
Sure was.

816
00:55:53,751 --> 00:55:55,784
You girls were such a handful.

817
00:55:55,786 --> 00:55:57,820
Did you guys hike a lot?

818
00:55:57,822 --> 00:55:59,955
Yeah. We love to sleep outside.

819
00:55:59,957 --> 00:56:01,957
Look at that.

820
00:56:01,959 --> 00:56:04,560
That's our tent. Wow.

821
00:56:04,562 --> 00:56:05,961
Yeah. That's where we slept

822
00:56:05,963 --> 00:56:08,430
every weekend when
we didn't go away.

823
00:56:08,432 --> 00:56:09,898
Yeah, it was great.

824
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:12,501
- In your yard?
- Yeah.

825
00:56:12,503 --> 00:56:14,370
We couldn't get them
back in the house.

826
00:56:14,372 --> 00:56:17,940
It... Tent was like
their little home.

827
00:56:19,008 --> 00:56:20,476
Is that Dad?

828
00:56:20,478 --> 00:56:21,844
No, it's...

829
00:56:28,017 --> 00:56:29,385
What is your problem?

830
00:56:29,387 --> 00:56:30,853
My problem is you're a whore!

831
00:56:30,855 --> 00:56:32,755
You should shut the fuck up.

832
00:56:32,757 --> 00:56:35,090
You have no idea what
you're talking about.

833
00:56:35,092 --> 00:56:36,959
I know what you did.

834
00:56:36,961 --> 00:56:38,394
Everyone does!

835
00:56:38,396 --> 00:56:40,462
We just don't
talk about it ever.

836
00:56:40,464 --> 00:56:42,464
Do we, Mom?

837
00:56:54,043 --> 00:56:57,813
You really thought I wanted
to be fucking that guy?

838
00:57:02,986 --> 00:57:04,753
Deep down, you knew.

839
00:57:16,766 --> 00:57:18,400
You okay?

840
00:57:23,006 --> 00:57:24,740
It'll be all right.

841
00:57:26,609 --> 00:57:29,545
No! No, it won't!

842
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:33,649
I should never
have listened to you.

843
00:57:33,651 --> 00:57:37,886
I went through all of that
shit, Charles, for what?

844
00:57:37,888 --> 00:57:39,488
W-Why?

845
00:57:39,490 --> 00:57:41,089
'Cause you wanted
to see your family.

846
00:57:41,091 --> 00:57:43,892
No, I didn't.

847
00:57:45,728 --> 00:57:49,531
I don't ever want
to see them again.

848
00:57:54,971 --> 00:57:58,540
I wish I could just erase
these past few weeks.

849
00:57:59,676 --> 00:58:02,044
You don't mean that.

850
00:58:09,853 --> 00:58:12,621
I only hung out with you

851
00:58:12,623 --> 00:58:14,590
because I felt bad for you.

852
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:20,195
You should know that.

853
00:58:36,779 --> 00:58:38,914
Still no sign of her, huh?

854
00:58:38,916 --> 00:58:40,549
No. It's been three days.

855
00:58:40,551 --> 00:58:42,050
Did you go by her place?

856
00:58:42,052 --> 00:58:43,619
Yeah.

857
00:58:43,621 --> 00:58:45,888
Well, there ain't
nothing harder to do

858
00:58:45,890 --> 00:58:48,590
than face your ghosts, you know.

859
00:58:48,592 --> 00:58:49,791
I know.

860
00:58:49,793 --> 00:58:51,760
She's a tough girl, Charles.

861
00:58:54,063 --> 00:58:57,065
Now don't you let this
go getting you down.

862
00:58:57,067 --> 00:58:59,001
Come on.
Gotta have faith, right?

863
00:58:59,003 --> 00:59:01,036
You gotta keep
believing in yourself.

864
00:59:01,038 --> 00:59:03,539
You're a great kid, Charles.

865
00:59:06,109 --> 00:59:07,843
Just hope she's all right.

866
00:59:07,845 --> 00:59:09,545
- I know. I know.
- She...

867
00:59:11,881 --> 00:59:14,082
I know one thing.
She doesn't want to see me.

868
00:59:14,084 --> 00:59:15,651
Oh, no, you don't know that.

869
00:59:15,653 --> 00:59:17,219
This probably has
nothing to do with you.

870
00:59:17,221 --> 00:59:19,521
She said so herself.
I'm history.

871
00:59:54,191 --> 00:59:57,259
Stand by for news.
It's next on Channel Five.

872
01:00:09,872 --> 01:00:11,840
She'll be back.

873
01:01:01,991 --> 01:01:03,992
Hey, Jimmy, you want a drag?

874
01:01:03,994 --> 01:01:05,761
Sure.

875
01:01:05,763 --> 01:01:07,129
Go fuck yourself.

876
01:01:10,433 --> 01:01:11,900
What's wrong, gimp?

877
01:01:11,902 --> 01:01:14,202
No bodyguard?

878
01:01:14,204 --> 01:01:16,304
Hey, how'd those photos
come out?

879
01:01:16,306 --> 01:01:18,866
You take any naked ones of
that whore friend of yours?

880
01:01:28,751 --> 01:01:31,153
Wow, pretty nice.

881
01:01:32,422 --> 01:01:34,423
So this is what you use

882
01:01:34,425 --> 01:01:36,425
to take all those
stupid pictures.

883
01:01:36,427 --> 01:01:38,727
You think you're so special

884
01:01:38,729 --> 01:01:40,262
with your camera and shit.

885
01:01:40,264 --> 01:01:42,864
Well, fuck you.

886
01:01:42,866 --> 01:01:45,867
Oh!

887
01:01:45,869 --> 01:01:47,202
- Pussy.
- Nice shot.

888
01:01:47,204 --> 01:01:48,837
We're outta here.

889
01:03:19,028 --> 01:03:20,028
Truck Stop.

890
01:03:20,030 --> 01:03:21,496
Hey, buddy.

891
01:03:23,199 --> 01:03:24,466
How's it going, man?

892
01:03:24,468 --> 01:03:26,535
Great.

893
01:03:26,537 --> 01:03:28,770
Say, uh...

894
01:03:30,206 --> 01:03:32,007
you haven't seen
my working girl, have you?

895
01:03:32,009 --> 01:03:33,809
No.

896
01:03:33,811 --> 01:03:36,978
I been looking
all over for her, man.

897
01:03:36,980 --> 01:03:39,080
Fuck if I can't find her.

898
01:03:48,224 --> 01:03:49,491
Oh, God damn, yeah.

899
01:04:13,951 --> 01:04:16,985
We got like
a connection, right?

900
01:04:16,987 --> 01:04:21,356
Like, kind of like
an understanding, right?

901
01:04:22,892 --> 01:04:26,394
I mean, shit, man,

902
01:04:26,396 --> 01:04:32,400
we know what it feels like to
have a fuckin' whore in our lives

903
01:04:32,402 --> 01:04:34,636
and then wake up one morning,

904
01:04:34,638 --> 01:04:37,939
and, poof,
she's just fuckin' gone.

905
01:04:37,941 --> 01:04:40,308
That's why.

906
01:04:40,310 --> 01:04:42,177
Well, you know what?

907
01:04:42,179 --> 01:04:45,180
I'll be God damned that
shit's gonna happen again,

908
01:04:45,182 --> 01:04:46,581
another whore abandons me.

909
01:04:46,583 --> 01:04:48,049
Fuck that shit, right?!

910
01:04:48,051 --> 01:04:49,284
Fuck it.

911
01:04:51,554 --> 01:04:53,021
Hey, you... you'd tell me

912
01:04:53,023 --> 01:04:55,056
if you saw her, right, brother?

913
01:04:55,058 --> 01:04:58,293
I mean, you wouldn't lie to
old Skid here, would you?

914
01:05:01,530 --> 01:05:05,267
Skid, I... I haven't seen her
in, like, a week or so.

915
01:05:07,004 --> 01:05:09,371
Aw, man.

916
01:05:09,373 --> 01:05:11,039
Yeah.

917
01:05:11,041 --> 01:05:13,275
You know what? You know what?

918
01:05:13,277 --> 01:05:18,413
Even if she doesn't come back,
I'm gonna fuckin' find her.

919
01:05:18,415 --> 01:05:19,614
Trust me.

920
01:05:21,284 --> 01:05:23,618
We'll be okay, right?

921
01:05:23,620 --> 01:05:25,086
Mm. Mm?

922
01:05:26,290 --> 01:05:27,522
We're gonna be okay.

923
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:32,294
You fuckin' hear that?

924
01:05:32,296 --> 01:05:33,461
No.

925
01:05:35,298 --> 01:05:36,598
I gotta go, man.

926
01:05:50,146 --> 01:05:52,113
Hello.

927
01:05:53,516 --> 01:05:55,150
Hello?

928
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:12,401
You shouldn't be outside, Dad.

929
01:06:12,402 --> 01:06:14,102
You're too sick.

930
01:06:14,104 --> 01:06:15,170
But...

931
01:06:17,073 --> 01:06:19,007
nothing hurts today.

932
01:06:30,486 --> 01:06:31,519
Here.

933
01:06:31,521 --> 01:06:32,687
Oh, no.

934
01:06:32,689 --> 01:06:35,390
No, no, I want you
to have this.

935
01:06:35,392 --> 01:06:36,424
It's yours now.

936
01:06:43,099 --> 01:06:45,033
Looks much better on you.

937
01:06:48,471 --> 01:06:51,406
You're a cowboy.

938
01:06:51,408 --> 01:06:53,608
New horizons.

939
01:06:55,244 --> 01:07:00,048
New discoveries ahead.

940
01:07:00,050 --> 01:07:03,051
God has given you
such an adventure.

941
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:06,354
Uncertainty...

942
01:07:07,790 --> 01:07:09,591
is exciting.

943
01:07:10,693 --> 01:07:12,660
Remember that.

944
01:07:14,730 --> 01:07:19,467
Nothing to be afraid of,

945
01:07:19,469 --> 01:07:21,036
okay, cowboy?

946
01:07:24,473 --> 01:07:26,741
You know, I'm so...

947
01:07:28,644 --> 01:07:31,079
very proud of you.

948
01:07:32,615 --> 01:07:34,449
You've become...

949
01:07:37,420 --> 01:07:38,686
a man.

950
01:07:44,693 --> 01:07:47,462
I love you, Charles.

951
01:07:49,331 --> 01:07:51,032
I love you, too, Dad.

952
01:07:55,738 --> 01:07:57,072
Kevin...

953
01:07:58,607 --> 01:08:00,475
I miss him, too.

954
01:08:11,353 --> 01:08:13,188
I wish he was here.

955
01:08:15,257 --> 01:08:18,760
I wish he could have seen
all the photos I've taken.

956
01:08:27,103 --> 01:08:30,338
Can you imagine what
he would say if I won?

957
01:08:31,674 --> 01:08:32,740
Right, Dad?

958
01:09:09,845 --> 01:09:12,780
Well, I thought everybody
was nice, didn't you?

959
01:09:14,450 --> 01:09:17,418
Stayed too long,
but at least they came.

960
01:09:17,420 --> 01:09:19,521
Do you have my smokes, hon?

961
01:09:23,726 --> 01:09:26,594
Always the gentleman. Thanks.

962
01:09:35,771 --> 01:09:36,938
You okay, angel?

963
01:09:36,940 --> 01:09:39,607
You haven't said two words.

964
01:09:43,345 --> 01:09:44,512
I'm all alone.

965
01:09:47,249 --> 01:09:48,950
No, you're not.

966
01:09:48,952 --> 01:09:50,318
You got me,

967
01:09:50,320 --> 01:09:52,654
and I'd do anything for you.

968
01:09:52,656 --> 01:09:53,922
You know that.

969
01:09:53,924 --> 01:09:56,491
Jack here, too.

970
01:09:56,493 --> 01:09:58,226
I know. It's not that.

971
01:09:59,696 --> 01:10:01,496
Well, what is it?

972
01:10:03,699 --> 01:10:06,301
What am I gonna do now?

973
01:10:07,369 --> 01:10:09,404
What do you mean?

974
01:10:09,406 --> 01:10:11,606
You're gonna keep doing the
same things you've always done.

975
01:10:11,608 --> 01:10:13,441
You're gonna keep working
at the truck stop,

976
01:10:13,443 --> 01:10:14,976
and you're gonna keep taking

977
01:10:14,978 --> 01:10:18,213
those beautiful pictures
with that camera of yours.

978
01:10:18,215 --> 01:10:20,848
The camera's gone.

979
01:10:20,850 --> 01:10:23,785
It's gone? Wh-Where is it?

980
01:10:23,787 --> 01:10:25,653
Kids at school trashed it.

981
01:10:25,655 --> 01:10:27,989
Oh, sweetie, come here.

982
01:10:29,359 --> 01:10:33,661
Oh, sweetie, it's okay.

983
01:10:33,663 --> 01:10:35,763
It's gonna be okay. I promise.

984
01:10:47,677 --> 01:10:49,711
Now I'd like
to announce the winners

985
01:10:49,713 --> 01:10:52,747
of this year's Cheeboro High
School Photography Contest.

986
01:10:52,749 --> 01:10:56,818
The third-place winner
with his excellent entry

987
01:10:56,820 --> 01:11:00,321
of Beacons of Light
is Charles Decker.

988
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:04,492
Congratulations, Charles.

989
01:11:04,494 --> 01:11:06,227
Thank you.

990
01:11:09,632 --> 01:11:11,566
The second-place winner

991
01:11:11,568 --> 01:11:15,570
with Desert Sunsets
is Ryan Nelson.

992
01:11:51,307 --> 01:11:52,707
There she is.

993
01:11:55,678 --> 01:11:57,378
I've been waiting for you.

994
01:12:03,085 --> 01:12:06,487
Who you running
around with, baby girl?

995
01:12:07,956 --> 01:12:10,591
Just some guys
down at the truck stop.

996
01:12:14,463 --> 01:12:15,263
Yeah?

997
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:20,768
Where's my jack?

998
01:12:22,638 --> 01:12:26,040
Can you give me a break, okay?

999
01:12:26,042 --> 01:12:28,509
I've been doing
some pretty heavy shit,

1000
01:12:28,511 --> 01:12:30,712
and I...

1001
01:12:30,714 --> 01:12:35,049
I just need a few hours
to... to sleep it off.

1002
01:12:35,051 --> 01:12:36,684
Please?

1003
01:12:39,755 --> 01:12:41,622
Okay.

1004
01:12:44,026 --> 01:12:46,327
But I want my money first.

1005
01:12:50,432 --> 01:12:53,835
Do you still think
that I stole from you?

1006
01:12:56,405 --> 01:12:58,072
I didn't.

1007
01:12:58,074 --> 01:13:00,975
I swear.

1008
01:13:00,977 --> 01:13:03,344
I didn't.

1009
01:13:10,819 --> 01:13:12,720
Ohh!

1010
01:13:14,456 --> 01:13:16,758
How do you explain that?
It was under your mattress.

1011
01:13:16,760 --> 01:13:18,593
- That's my cut.
- You just ran away from me?

1012
01:13:18,595 --> 01:13:19,994
- Deserted me?
- No.

1013
01:13:19,996 --> 01:13:21,597
After all the fuckin' shit
I did for you,

1014
01:13:21,598 --> 01:13:22,764
like a typical fuckin' whore?

1015
01:13:22,766 --> 01:13:24,399
No. I was coming back

1016
01:13:24,401 --> 01:13:26,033
and doing tricks for you.

1017
01:13:26,035 --> 01:13:28,403
- Here's your money.
- Don't you fuckin' lie to me.

1018
01:13:28,405 --> 01:13:31,172
I'm not. I am not lying to you.

1019
01:13:31,174 --> 01:13:33,141
You been wanting to leave me
for a motherfucking...

1020
01:13:33,143 --> 01:13:35,042
Don't, please. Ohh!

1021
01:13:37,414 --> 01:13:39,680
No. No. No, please!

1022
01:13:39,682 --> 01:13:42,049
I just want you
to be good to me.

1023
01:13:42,051 --> 01:13:43,718
Okay.

1024
01:13:43,720 --> 01:13:46,120
I just want you to show me
some fuckin' respect

1025
01:13:46,122 --> 01:13:47,889
and make me some fuckin' money!

1026
01:13:47,891 --> 01:13:50,158
Do you think
you can handle that?

1027
01:13:50,160 --> 01:13:51,759
Yes! I...

1028
01:13:51,761 --> 01:13:53,761
Do you think you
can fuckin' handle that?

1029
01:13:53,763 --> 01:13:55,163
Yes, I can do it. Do it, then.

1030
01:13:55,165 --> 01:13:57,799
That's all I want!

1031
01:14:01,837 --> 01:14:04,939
Hey, Truck Stop.

1032
01:14:04,941 --> 01:14:07,542
Hey, my man.

1033
01:14:07,544 --> 01:14:09,210
Is that you?

1034
01:14:09,212 --> 01:14:12,947
Oh, God damn it.

1035
01:14:12,949 --> 01:14:15,716
God damn, is that who you
been running around with?

1036
01:14:15,718 --> 01:14:16,984
No. No.

1037
01:14:16,986 --> 01:14:19,454
A fucking cripple
from the truck stop?

1038
01:14:19,456 --> 01:14:21,022
No.

1039
01:14:21,024 --> 01:14:22,657
What?

1040
01:14:22,659 --> 01:14:24,058
Charles, Charles,

1041
01:14:24,060 --> 01:14:27,595
Charles,
you have to go, please.

1042
01:14:27,597 --> 01:14:30,998
What are you doing, Truck Stop?

1043
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:32,033
Huh?

1044
01:14:32,035 --> 01:14:33,167
Leave her alone.

1045
01:14:36,939 --> 01:14:40,041
I told you to stay
out of my business.

1046
01:14:40,043 --> 01:14:42,043
I'm not fuckin'
playin' with you anymore.

1047
01:14:42,045 --> 01:14:43,211
Charles! Whoa!

1048
01:14:43,213 --> 01:14:46,714
You motherfucker.

1049
01:14:46,716 --> 01:14:50,017
This is your last chance to
get the fuck outta here.

1050
01:14:51,187 --> 01:14:53,921
Yeah.

1051
01:14:53,923 --> 01:14:55,723
Oh, yeah.

1052
01:14:55,725 --> 01:14:57,825
I can't let you
get away with that.

1053
01:14:57,827 --> 01:14:59,494
No.

1054
01:14:59,496 --> 01:15:00,862
What kind of a man would I be

1055
01:15:00,864 --> 01:15:03,531
if I let you
get away with that, huh?

1056
01:15:08,103 --> 01:15:10,238
Ah, man, I'll just
hit him again.

1057
01:15:10,240 --> 01:15:11,639
No!

1058
01:15:11,641 --> 01:15:13,074
Back away from me!

1059
01:15:14,843 --> 01:15:15,877
Aw, come on.

1060
01:15:20,182 --> 01:15:21,516
Wake up.

1061
01:15:21,518 --> 01:15:24,919
Wake up. Come on. Wake up.

1062
01:15:24,921 --> 01:15:28,089
I'm just gonna teach you
a little lesson, right.

1063
01:15:28,091 --> 01:15:29,724
Just a little lesson, okay?

1064
01:15:29,726 --> 01:15:31,292
Okay?

1065
01:15:31,294 --> 01:15:33,494
Don't!

1066
01:15:33,896 --> 01:15:35,763
Don't.

1067
01:15:37,533 --> 01:15:38,900
Don't.

1068
01:16:13,001 --> 01:16:15,169
Hey. Hey, come on.

1069
01:16:15,171 --> 01:16:16,904
Hey. Hey.

1070
01:16:46,835 --> 01:16:49,770
Photographs don't lie.

1071
01:16:49,772 --> 01:16:54,108
In a darkroom,
film comes to life...

1072
01:16:57,145 --> 01:16:59,814
capturing a moment in time.

1073
01:17:01,149 --> 01:17:04,952
Sometimes someone
shows up in your life,

1074
01:17:04,954 --> 01:17:07,922
and you help each other
without even knowing it.

1075
01:17:10,025 --> 01:17:12,226
In here, I feel balanced.

1076
01:17:15,130 --> 01:17:16,697
And out there...

1077
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,167
Hey, can I ask you something?

1078
01:17:20,169 --> 01:17:21,602
Go for it.

1079
01:17:23,372 --> 01:17:25,006
You okay?

1080
01:17:25,008 --> 01:17:26,340
Yeah, I'm cool.

1081
01:17:27,643 --> 01:17:29,210
I'll see you soon?

1082
01:17:29,212 --> 01:17:31,312
Yeah, you'll see me soon.

1083
01:17:37,753 --> 01:17:38,886
You take care.

1084
01:17:38,888 --> 01:17:40,388
You, too.

1085
01:17:40,390 --> 01:17:41,856
And keep taking pictures.

1086
01:17:41,858 --> 01:17:43,824
I will.

1087
01:17:46,663 --> 01:17:49,030
- See you later.
- Bye.
