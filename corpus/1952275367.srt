  Well good. I love you too.

00:01:01,234 --> 00:01:04,133
But then you've known that for a
few hours now.

7
00:01:11,467 --> 00:01:13,901
 I've never been here before.
This is great.

8
00:01:13,968 --> 00:01:15,334
Yeah, isn't it?

9
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,701
Winter picnic.

00:01:17,767 --> 00:01:21,601
   Yeah.  There's cheese and
  crackers there if you want.

00:01:21,667 --> 00:01:25,734
  Awesome.  This is so great.
  Thank you so much.

No, thank you's aren't

  Um, do you mind if I toast?

00:01:37,033 --> 00:01:38,767
Love it if you toasted.

15
00:01:38,834 --> 00:01:41,300
 There's some things I want to
   get off my chest.

16
00:01:41,367 --> 00:01:48,901
To the greatest person I've ever
 met?

17
00:01:48,968 --> 00:01:51,300
   Wow, that sounded stupid.

18
00:01:51,367 --> 00:01:58,334
Well the sentiment still stands.
I think you're great, and I am
very glad that we meet.

19
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,100
 These past couple weeks have
been -

00:02:01,167 --> 00:02:02,667
 Three weeks.

21
00:02:02,734 --> 00:02:09,734

00:02:11,167 --> 00:02:15,801
  And... I love you.

24
00:02:25,133 --> 00:02:28,667
You don't have to say anything
 back.

 Okay.

26
00:02:32,267 --> 00:02:37,300

 Is this a good wine?

30
00:02:48,234 --> 00:02:50,000
   It is, actually.

31
00:02:50,067 --> 00:02:51,167

34
00:04:39,834 --> 00:04:41,667
 Why?

35
00:04:41,734 --> 00:04:48,133
You're the one that - you wanted

  watch this.

38
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,601
   God! Ow!

39
00:05:05,667 --> 00:05:07,367
  That didn't hurt, you liar.

40
00:05:07,434 --> 00:05:15,000
It was your idea, what do you,
   what do you want?

41
00:05:15,067 --> 00:05:18,534
 Well, I have a lot of ideas.

42
00:05:18,601 --> 00:05:20,767
  No.

43
00:05:20,834 --> 00:05:26,000
  How can you say no?

44
00:05:26,067 --> 00:05:28,501
 I don't know. I'm not in the
 mood.

45
00:05:28,567 --> 00:05:32,701
  It's fine.

46

  Well, that's great.

48
00:05:36,701 --> 00:05:39,467
   Why are you being cross?

49
00:05:39,534 --> 00:05:41,367
 I'm not being cross.
I'm watching the show.

50
00:05:41,434 --> 00:05:49,267
You know. You know what I mean.
Would you be interested in some
 other things?

51
00:05:49,334 --> 00:05:51,467
Maybe.

52
00:05:51,534 --> 00:05:56,667
  Let's see if we can get you
there.

53
00:05:56,734 --> 00:06:02,801
Well I'm not just a switch that
you can turn on and off. Okay?

54
00:06:02,868 --> 00:06:07,033
I'm a human and I have feelings.

55
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:13,601

60
00:06:49,067 --> 00:06:51,300
   Is anybody sitting here?

61
00:06:51,367 --> 00:06:54,434
  No.

62
00:07:07,234 --> 00:07:09,734
You ever heard of this brand of
  ginger ale?

63
00:07:09,801 --> 00:07:12,934
 No I haven't.

64
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,801
Probably costs two dollars for a
  case of it.

65
00:07:16,868 --> 00:07:18,534
   Exactly.

66
00:07:18,601 --> 00:07:20,067
 Well it tastes fine.

67
00:07:20,133 --> 00:07:22,400
  I'm Peter.

68
00:07:22,467 --> 00:07:26,100
   Hi Peter.

69
00:07:37,501 --> 00:07:40,567
 But uh, just one last note on
   this guy.

70
00:07:40,634 --> 00:07:42,667
 You know how he does a little
salad on the side of the chicken

71
00:07:42,734 --> 00:07:44,400
  and the rice like you have
there?

72
00:07:44,467 --> 00:07:45,734
 Yeah?

73
00:07:45,801 --> 00:07:52,701
Well I started, he'll, you can
get instead of the fried rice,

74
00:07:52,767 --> 00:07:56,400
 he'll put a bed of salad with
  the chicken on top for ya.

75
00:07:56,467 --> 00:07:59,801
So you get a salad with grilled
  chicken for $3.50.

76
00:07:59,868 --> 00:08:01,467
 That's Good to know.

77
00:08:01,534 --> 00:08:03,167
  Yeah, yeah.

78
00:08:09,567 --> 00:08:12,801
I mean you can continue to eat
  the, all that fried stuff,

79
00:08:12,868 --> 00:08:19,000
 but, if you're interested in
something a little more healthy,
less fattening,

80
00:08:19,067 --> 00:08:22,167
uh, he'll uh, he'll make it for
  just salad for ya.

81
00:08:27,934 --> 00:08:30,701
How come you're having it with
 rice?

82
00:08:30,767 --> 00:08:35,801
   I'm in training.
 So I'm carboloading.

83
00:08:35,868 --> 00:08:37,367
 Well what are you in training
 for?

 No, I'm just in a hungry man
 kind of a mood today.

122
00:11:17,868 --> 00:11:32,000
Um, maybe you should go back to
your apartment.

123
00:11:32,067 --> 00:11:34,334
 Yeah. Yeah. I think.

124
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:37,234
I think I'm not ready for you to
  stay here.

125
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,467
  Okay, yeah.

126
00:11:38,534 --> 00:11:43,400
 Do you want me to set up the
couch?

127
00:11:43,467 --> 00:11:46,868
Do you want to do that?

128
00:11:46,934 --> 00:11:49,934
  Uh, this is stupid.

129
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,934
 No I mean I can, I can take a
 cab.

130
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,334
 Okay.

131
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:57,801
Well no, do you mind if I stay
 on the couch?

132
00:11:57,868 --> 00:12:00,434
I think that maybe it could be a
  good idea.

133
00:12:00,501 --> 00:12:03,133
   Okay. Yeah, you're right.

134

00:12:34,801 --> 00:12:40,234
 Okay.

141
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:43,334

Whatever.  You choose.

145
00:12:59,133 --> 00:13:01,000

Have we ordered form this Thai
place?

147

Yeah.  That's the one where you
 said the Pad Thai tasted like
Vagina.

148
00:13:11,767 --> 00:13:18,968
That wasn't this place.  And I
   didn't say it tasted like
Vagina.

149
00:13:19,033 --> 00:13:23,801
I said this Pad That tastes like
 "Poon Thai."

150
00:13:23,868 --> 00:13:25,434
  Pick a place Peter.

151
00:13:25,501 --> 00:13:29,901

It's too much starch. You want a
 shrimp dish?

159
00:13:50,033 --> 00:13:50,934
  Well you're not helping me.

175
00:15:00,634 --> 00:15:02,868
No. I'm breaking in a new purse.

176
00:15:02,934 --> 00:15:06,767
What? Are you - really?

177
00:15:06,834 --> 00:15:08,834
Yeah.  Sometimes you want them
  to look not so new.

178
00:15:08,901 --> 00:15:12,667
That's so cool.  Do you put it 
 under your mattress?

179
00:15:12,734 --> 00:15:14,801
 What?

180
00:15:14,868 --> 00:15:17,467
 Well that's what you do with
   baseball gloves.

181
00:15:17,534 --> 00:15:19,734
 Thank you very much.

182
00:15:19,801 --> 00:15:22,100
Do you tie it up with string or?

183
00:15:22,167 --> 00:15:24,968
   That's what you do with a
baseball glove?

184
00:15:25,033 --> 00:15:28,968
Yes, you tie it up with string
 and put a baseball inside and
   you rub it down.

185
00:15:29,033 --> 00:15:31,634
  You don't, you don't put a
   baseball inside?

186
00:15:36,334 --> 00:15:40,033
 Are you okay?

187
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:45,067
Just had a little aftertaste of
vagina.

188
00:15:45,133 --> 00:15:51,067
  Sorry. Here try it.

189
00:15:51,133 --> 00:15:53,534
Try it?

190
00:15:53,601 --> 00:16:01,367
Come on.  Just smell it then. 
  Just experiment, loosen up.

191
00:16:01,434 --> 00:16:03,033
  No I don't want your "Poon
Thai."

192
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:05,300
Okay. Ew it got on me.

193
00:16:05,367 --> 00:16:11,701
Exactly.  This Pad Thai tastes
   like "Poon Thai."

194
00:16:11,767 --> 00:16:13,968
   Can I have some of yours?

195
00:16:14,033 --> 00:16:15,267
You're going to keep eating it?

196
00:16:36,434 --> 00:16:37,067
  Hey

197
00:16:37,133 --> 00:16:38,400
  Hey what's up man.

198
00:16:38,467 --> 00:16:39,234
 Keith

199
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,968
   No no, hey Keith.

200
00:16:41,033 --> 00:16:42,200
You had that look on your face
like maybe you didn't remember
   my name.

201
00:16:42,267 --> 00:16:43,501
 No no no, not at all.

202
00:16:43,567 --> 00:16:44,868
 Vandy's brotherinlaw.

203
00:16:44,934 --> 00:16:47,033
 Right, right.  He really does
  look like that guy.

204
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:47,801
I know.

205
00:16:47,868 --> 00:16:49,400
So uh you've met my wife Emma.

206
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:51,000
   Hi I remember Emma also.

207
00:16:51,067 --> 00:16:53,000
 How are you Emma? How's Delia

208
00:16:53,067 --> 00:16:55,534
  I'm good how are you? She's
 great she's over at the kid's
 table having a blast.

209
00:16:55,601 --> 00:16:57,467
 You know I don't believe that
 we're not at the same table.

210
00:16:57,534 --> 00:16:58,334
I know.

211
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,234
  I think it's crap.

212
00:16:59,300 --> 00:16:59,968
It is.

213
00:17:00,033 --> 00:17:01,400
   It's ridiculous.

214
00:17:01,467 --> 00:17:03,100
  I know you guys never get a
chance to talk, it's bullshit.

215
00:17:03,167 --> 00:17:05,300
Yeah, you know you're still on
my shit list. You don't get to
 joke with me.

216
00:17:05,367 --> 00:17:08,300
  Okay well we're going to go
 dance because Emma took some
   dancing lessons.

217
00:17:08,367 --> 00:17:11,601
   Stripper!

218
00:17:11,667 --> 00:17:13,934
Love them.  How long have they
 been married?

219
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,434
   Eight years. You guys get
  reminded of your wedding at
these?

220
00:17:18,501 --> 00:17:20,267
  Not really.

221
00:17:20,334 --> 00:17:22,300
It was so romantic she blocked
it out.

222
00:17:22,367 --> 00:17:24,701
 Yeah.

223
00:17:24,767 --> 00:17:30,968
What's wrong with you?  He was
there the day we were betrothed?

224
00:17:31,033 --> 00:17:32,334
I was.

225
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,634
You use that word every chance
   you get.

226
00:17:34,701 --> 00:17:35,934
  Betrothed?

227
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 Yes.

228
00:17:37,067 --> 00:17:38,300
  Betrothed?

229
00:17:38,367 --> 00:17:39,267
 Yes.

230
00:17:39,334 --> 00:17:42,067
  Betrothed?

231
00:17:42,133 --> 00:17:45,801
  Yes.  I get your joke Paul,
  you're very funny.

232
00:17:45,868 --> 00:17:47,868
 I'm getting another cocktail
  does anybody want anything?

233
00:17:47,934 --> 00:17:48,734
   I'll have a beer.

234
00:17:48,801 --> 00:17:49,667
  I'll have one too.

235
00:17:49,734 --> 00:17:50,601
Honey?

236
00:17:50,667 --> 00:17:51,767
   I'm good.

237
00:17:51,834 --> 00:17:53,334
   Do you have any singles?

238
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,601
   What do you want it for?

239
00:17:55,667 --> 00:17:57,434
   Nothing.

240
00:17:57,501 --> 00:18:00,834
Honey, this is a formal event.
   You don't have to tip the
  bartender.

241
00:18:00,901 --> 00:18:03,901
Bartender didn't have a problem
   with it.

242
00:18:03,968 --> 00:18:05,968
It's not done.

243
00:18:06,033 --> 00:18:07,868
 Of course it's done I've done
  it.

244
00:18:07,934 --> 00:18:10,100
I don't want to argue about this
   with you.

245
00:18:10,167 --> 00:18:12,501
I'm asking you nicely.

246
00:18:12,567 --> 00:18:15,334
And I appreciate that. But this
  isn't one of your cousin's
   weddings.

247
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,934
 You don't tip the bartender.

248
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,567
  Okay. You gonna give me the
singles or not?

249
00:18:21,634 --> 00:18:25,067
Absolutely not. Look I
understand that you think you're
 being a good person,

250
00:18:25,133 --> 00:18:27,901
 and you are, but it's
 embarrassing and I don't want
 you doing it.

251
00:18:27,968 --> 00:18:29,834
  Are you like my keeper now?

252
00:18:29,901 --> 00:18:34,200
Listen.  I'm not going to open
my purse and support something I
   don't believe in.

253
00:18:34,267 --> 00:18:37,701
Do you understand that?  Now if
you want to go get singles and
  give them to the bartender

254
00:18:37,767 --> 00:18:42,300
 and embarrass yourself, fine.
 But I'm not going to help you
   make an ass of yourself.

255
00:18:42,367 --> 00:18:46,667
 Fine!  I forgot, what kind of
beer you want?

256
00:18:46,734 --> 00:18:51,400
   Uh, Stella would be fine.

257
00:18:51,467 --> 00:18:54,767
   Oh yeah.

258
00:18:54,834 --> 00:18:59,267
 I mean, unbelievable.

259
00:18:59,334 --> 00:19:03,367
Is it me?  Is it me?  Just tell
me if I'm wrong, tell me if I'm
wrong.

260
00:19:03,434 --> 00:19:09,467
 Yeah. No. They're, uh, I mean
  I've seen like a few people
   doing it but, no.

261
00:19:09,534 --> 00:19:15,100
Right.  He expects me to just -
Jesus - he's over there asking -

262
00:19:15,167 --> 00:19:20,901
What was that?

263
00:19:20,968 --> 00:19:23,868
 I don't know.
 It's awesome though.

264
00:19:23,934 --> 00:19:28,601
Don't say that we're like that.

265
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:32,133
We're not.  We are not like that
at all.

266
00:20:05,267 --> 00:20:07,167
What are you doing in my closet?

267
00:20:07,234 --> 00:20:09,434
   Nothing.

268
00:20:09,501 --> 00:20:17,901
 Oh.  Here we go.  You should
wear this one.

269
00:20:17,968 --> 00:20:22,400
   Good one.

270
00:20:22,467 --> 00:20:23,834
 What?

271
00:20:23,901 --> 00:20:25,501
Shut up Vandy.

272
00:20:25,567 --> 00:20:29,667
You shut up.  I'm serious, you
 should wear this one.

273
00:20:29,734 --> 00:20:32,133
It would look really nice with
the gray suit.

274
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:36,367
  Are you fucking kidding me?

275
00:20:36,434 --> 00:20:38,267
No I think you should wear it.

276
00:20:38,334 --> 00:20:42,400
Okay.  I'm serious, go back to
 bed.

277
00:20:42,467 --> 00:20:50,000
   What's the matter.  Poopy
 doesn't want to wear a purple
shirt?

278
00:20:50,067 --> 00:20:56,667
Poopy afraid he won't be a real
 man if he's wearing a purple.

279
00:20:56,734 --> 00:20:59,567
Poopy doesn't want to be touched
 okay?

280
00:20:59,634 --> 00:21:02,534
 Don't get all tense already.

281
00:21:02,601 --> 00:21:05,234
I'm not tense.

282
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:08,234
   Stop acting like such an
   asshole.

283
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:15,400
Why don't you go back to bed? 
It's early you don't need to be
up yet.

284
00:21:23,467 --> 00:21:26,734
   So you feel good?

285
00:21:26,801 --> 00:21:28,901
 What?

286
00:21:28,968 --> 00:21:31,968
I mean do you feel like
   yourself?

287
00:21:32,033 --> 00:21:34,167
  What are you talking about?

288
00:21:34,234 --> 00:21:37,567
Well you said before you don't
do well in interviews,

289
00:21:37,634 --> 00:21:42,133
 that you go into a trance or
something, and you never end up
 acting like yourself.

290
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:48,634
So are you feeling like
   yourself?

291
00:21:48,701 --> 00:21:51,634
Yeah.  I'm feeling like myself.

292
00:21:51,701 --> 00:21:56,934
 Good.  You're gonna be fine.

293
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:02,868
This tie is shorter than normal
 ones.

294
00:22:02,934 --> 00:22:04,133
   Want me to do it?

295
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:08,968
So. Do you have things you know
you want to talk about?

296
00:22:09,033 --> 00:22:12,734
Or are you just going there and
 wing it? Or.

297
00:22:12,801 --> 00:22:17,634
No I just answer the questions.

298
00:22:17,701 --> 00:22:20,634
  Oh.

299
00:22:20,701 --> 00:22:22,534
 Why?

300
00:22:22,601 --> 00:22:32,434
Just wondering.

301
00:22:32,501 --> 00:22:34,234
 Are you okay?

302
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:37,434
  Just can't believe this is
   happening again.

303
00:22:37,501 --> 00:22:40,067
  What's the matter?

304
00:22:40,133 --> 00:22:41,567
   Nothing.

305
00:22:41,634 --> 00:22:42,868
 What?

306
00:22:42,934 --> 00:22:49,334
I.  I hate interviews.  I suck
   at them.

307
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,701
 I go in there and I apologize
  for myself

308
00:22:51,767 --> 00:22:56,467
and I just didn't think it was
  going to happen this time.

309
00:22:56,534 --> 00:22:58,834
 I thought I was done being a
jerkoff. Fuck!

310
00:22:58,901 --> 00:23:14,968
Hey now, come here. Oh my baby. 
Angel.  You're gonna be great.

311
00:23:17,033 --> 00:23:25,601
  I'm just so tense.

312
00:23:25,667 --> 00:23:32,200
 Would you like for me to help
  you relax?

313
00:23:32,267 --> 00:23:34,968
   What do you mean?

314
00:23:35,033 --> 00:23:51,167
 Just sit back.  Let me do the
  work.  Hey. Who's the best
   interviewer in the world?

315
00:23:52,067 --> 00:23:55,033
 I am.

316
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:58,601
 That's right.

317
00:24:20,467 --> 00:24:23,367
  Thank you for saying that.

318
00:24:23,434 --> 00:24:25,701
  You mean the toast?

319
00:24:25,767 --> 00:24:28,367
  Yeah. No, I meant the wine.

320
00:24:28,434 --> 00:24:32,834
Oh. Yeah I figured you meant the
toast but maybe you spent a lot
   of time picking the wine.

321
00:24:32,901 --> 00:24:37,067
No I got the wine from my dad I
 - I meant the toast.

322
00:24:37,133 --> 00:24:40,934
  Thank you.

323
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,801
You're welcome?  I'm sorry If I

324
00:24:45,868 --> 00:24:56,400
Don't. Can I ask you something?

325
00:24:56,467 --> 00:24:58,200
Course

326
00:24:58,267 --> 00:25:01,767
Because we said we were going to
  be honest with each other.

327
00:25:01,834 --> 00:25:04,901
Right.

328
00:25:04,968 --> 00:25:07,400
 What are you thinking about?

329
00:25:07,467 --> 00:25:11,067
  Right now?

330
00:25:11,133 --> 00:25:14,934
  Or just a few seconds ago.

331
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:22,100
  Um, I'm not sure what I was
  thinking a few seconds ago.

332
00:25:22,167 --> 00:25:39,033
 Um, as for now, honestly, I'm
  angry that you would ask me
 that.

333
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:45,934
   I feel like shit.
 What else would I be feeling?

334
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,968
  I'm sorry.

335
00:25:48,033 --> 00:25:49,200
  It's okay.

336
00:25:49,267 --> 00:25:50,934
I was just trying to be close.

337
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,000
  It's fine.

338
00:25:55,067 --> 00:25:57,434
   I don't know why I asked.

339
00:25:57,501 --> 00:26:00,567
 It's okay, it's okay.

340
00:26:00,634 --> 00:26:09,133
 I like the way you do things.
  A lot. So.

341
00:26:17,334 --> 00:26:19,300
  I love you.

342
00:26:19,367 --> 00:26:20,701
You do?

343
00:26:20,767 --> 00:26:22,734
 I do.

344
00:26:22,801 --> 00:26:27,100
  Well good.

345
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,334
  Oh my god.

346
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,100
 Hello Vandy.

347
00:27:08,167 --> 00:27:09,601
  Hi.

348
00:27:09,667 --> 00:27:14,100
  So.

349
00:27:14,167 --> 00:27:15,300
What'cha doing?

350
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:16,968
 I was just about to ask you.

351
00:27:17,033 --> 00:27:18,367
  Christmas shopping.

352
00:27:18,434 --> 00:27:21,033
Right I saw the bags, I should
  have put the two together.

353
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:26,200
 I'm actually heading over to
   that golf store.

354
00:27:26,267 --> 00:27:31,601
I'm gong on a trip with uh Gary
 and Paul.  Going to Arizona.

355
00:27:31,667 --> 00:27:34,701
 Sure they're glad to have you
around.

356
00:27:34,767 --> 00:27:41,133
 Actually to do remember that
thing I read you about how you
   play golf during the day,

357
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:47,501
uh, and you bet on all the holes
 an that night you play poker
  with the winnings?

358
00:27:47,567 --> 00:27:49,434
   Vaguely.

359
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:59,334
 Yeah well, play poker uh with
the winnings until someone goes
 bust.  Should be fun.

360
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,267
  It sounds like fun.

361
00:28:01,334 --> 00:28:06,601
Um, I should get going I have a
thousand things to do.

362
00:28:06,667 --> 00:28:09,000
  Emma and I are gong to the
  Caribbean after Christmas.

363
00:28:09,067 --> 00:28:10,868
 That's great! Where?

364
00:28:10,934 --> 00:28:14,467
St. Thomas.  It's her idea and 
   she got me the ticket and
  everything

365
00:28:14,534 --> 00:28:17,434
   and so I want to get her
something so I was going to go
to that place,

366
00:28:17,501 --> 00:28:22,000
that jewelry store that's near
 our apartment - my apartment,
and um

367
00:28:22,067 --> 00:28:25,601
 Yeah that's a nice place uh,
it's expensive.

368
00:28:25,667 --> 00:28:29,267
Yeah but I can have that jeweler
we know remake if I see
  something.

369
00:28:29,334 --> 00:28:31,133
Yeah that's what I was going to.

370
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,300
So I was going to go do that and
then I was going to go tanning.

371
00:28:34,367 --> 00:28:36,934
  That's a good idea.

372
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,634
 So I don't get burned in the
  Caribbean.

373
00:28:38,701 --> 00:28:42,667
  I know. Have you gone yet?

374
00:28:42,734 --> 00:28:44,133
   Yeah a week ago.

375
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:50,934
Yeah you look. You have a good
color.

376
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,234
Thanks.

377
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:57,601
   So you're going that way?

378
00:28:57,667 --> 00:28:59,234
Yeah um

379
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:02,601
I'm going in the other
direction, I would have walked
   with you.

380
00:29:02,667 --> 00:29:03,601
  It's okay.

381
00:29:03,667 --> 00:29:10,267
So is your family okay?

382
00:29:10,334 --> 00:29:14,601

Oh yeah, they're fine.

Have a great Christmas and a fun
  time with the boys.

385
00:29:22,234 --> 00:29:24,100
Say hi to Pail for me.

Okay yeah.  Say hi to Emma for
 me, she'll love that.

387
00:29:26,968 --> 00:29:28,234
   Shut up.

388
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:29,834
 You shut up.

389
00:29:29,901 --> 00:29:33,501
 I should go.

390
00:29:33,567 --> 00:29:35,434
 Okay.

391
00:29:35,501 --> 00:29:36,701
Have a good Christmas.

392
00:29:36,767 --> 00:29:40,901
 Yeah you too.

393
00:29:40,968 --> 00:29:57,100
  **

394
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:21,634
 Hey.

395
00:30:21,701 --> 00:30:23,300
 Hey.

396
00:30:23,367 --> 00:30:25,300
  So.

397
00:30:25,367 --> 00:30:27,133
  So.

398
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,901
 How'd it go?

399
00:30:28,968 --> 00:30:30,834
 Fine.

400
00:30:30,901 --> 00:30:37,834
   That's it? How did it go?

401
00:30:37,901 --> 00:30:40,701
 It went fine.

402
00:30:40,767 --> 00:30:42,968
 Did they give you any
  indication?

403
00:30:43,033 --> 00:30:48,767
They thanked me and said they'd
 be in touch.  It went well, I
 mean.

404
00:30:48,834 --> 00:30:50,868
 Good you got the feeling then
  that it went well.

405
00:30:50,934 --> 00:30:52,734
Yeah I just said it went well.

406
00:30:52,801 --> 00:30:57,968
Yeah I know it's just you're not
   giving me any specifics.

407
00:30:58,033 --> 00:31:04,901
Well I don't know what to tell
 you it was an interview.  It
 went well, I guess, you know.

408
00:31:04,968 --> 00:31:09,267
They guy was like 60 years old
 so it's not like we, you know

409
00:31:09,334 --> 00:31:13,734
it's not like we had friends in
 common or something it was an
  interview.

410
00:31:13,801 --> 00:31:15,767
 Do you know if he liked you?

411
00:31:15,834 --> 00:31:17,801
 I don't know if he liked me.

412
00:31:17,868 --> 00:31:21,634
It's not like he was looking for
a new best friend he was looking
  for someone to do the job.

413
00:31:21,701 --> 00:31:25,701
 Someone who's competent, so,
that's what I was trying to be.

414
00:31:25,767 --> 00:31:27,367
 Trying to be?

415
00:31:27,434 --> 00:31:30,033
 Honestly I don't want to talk
   about it anymore.

416
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:32,801
There's really nothing else to
  say.  It went fine.  Okay?

417
00:31:32,868 --> 00:31:35,868
 Okay

418
00:31:35,934 --> 00:31:39,734
You hungry?  You want me to fix
 you a snack?

419
00:31:39,801 --> 00:31:41,767
   Sure.  I don't see much.

420
00:31:41,834 --> 00:31:48,334
There isn't.  I could make you a
PB and J.  You want me to make
   you one?

421
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,734
  I guess so.

422
00:31:50,801 --> 00:31:54,100
 Okay.

423
00:31:59,367 --> 00:32:02,000
Is that what you call a peanut
  butter and jelly sandwich?

424
00:32:02,067 --> 00:32:04,534
  A PB and J?

425
00:32:04,601 --> 00:32:10,234
  Yup.  Why?

426
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:12,267
  Did the mail come?

427
00:32:12,334 --> 00:32:16,734
 Mmhmm yeah it was just junk. 
   And a travel and leisure
   magazine.

428
00:32:16,801 --> 00:32:18,133
Great.

429
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,534
   Did they mention what the
  vacation time was?

430
00:32:20,601 --> 00:32:22,934
  No.

431
00:32:31,434 --> 00:32:34,133
  What are you doing?

432
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:37,400
 Don't start with me.

433
00:32:37,467 --> 00:32:42,334
 I'm just trying to figure out
  what you're doing.

434
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:45,367
I'm trying to be nice.

435
00:32:45,434 --> 00:32:50,334
Are you using two knives to make
   a peanut putter and jelly
   sandwich?

436
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:58,400
Yeah uh, I don't want to get the
peanut butter in the jelly jar.
 Okay?

437
00:32:58,467 --> 00:32:59,534
Well -

438
00:32:59,601 --> 00:33:02,067
 Don't start with me.

439
00:33:02,133 --> 00:33:06,133
 Okay.

440
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,934
  What is the matter.

441
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,200
I mean you're going to get the
sandwich and it's going to taste
   the same.

442
00:33:10,267 --> 00:33:11,767
   What's the problem Peter?

443
00:33:11,834 --> 00:33:16,000
  There is no problem Vandy.

444
00:33:16,067 --> 00:33:18,934
  Like it's my fault.

445
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:24,200
 You know what the problem is.

446
00:33:24,267 --> 00:33:32,901
  The problem is that only a
  fucking moron would use two
  knives to make a PB and J?

447
00:33:32,968 --> 00:33:36,634
Who do you think - give me the
knife.

448
00:33:36,701 --> 00:33:38,434
Peter -

449
00:33:38,501 --> 00:33:41,267
I'm not going to kill you Vandy 
just give me the knife.

450
00:33:41,334 --> 00:33:46,467
 Fine I'll use your other one.
  Now watch.

451
00:33:46,534 --> 00:33:51,300
First what you do is you spread
 the PB, okay.

452
00:33:51,367 --> 00:33:57,167
 Now you see this excess PB on
the knife?  You wipe it on the
 other slice of bread.  Okay?

453
00:33:57,234 --> 00:33:58,701
  See that peanut butter shit
stain?

454
00:33:58,767 --> 00:34:02,734
  That means the knife is now
clean and ready for the J, okay?

455
00:34:02,801 --> 00:34:08,767
Fuckface! Maybe if you shut up
and stopped being such a fucking
  psychopath

456
00:34:08,834 --> 00:34:10,467
  you might learn something.

457
00:34:10,534 --> 00:34:13,701
  You are a fucking asshole!

458
00:34:13,767 --> 00:34:16,367
Oh yeah it's always me being the
   asshole isn't it?

459
00:34:16,434 --> 00:34:20,501
   Why don't you try taking
  responsibility for your own
 stupid shit.

460
00:34:20,567 --> 00:34:25,734
I don't like doing it that way!
The knife is never clean enough!

461
00:34:25,801 --> 00:34:30,033
Okay, Fuckface! Why don't you go
fuck yourself.

462
00:34:36,701 --> 00:34:39,834
This bread is soft.  So it will 
 always make the knife clean!

463
00:34:39,901 --> 00:34:45,200
 Unless, you're a fucking ape,
   and don't know how to do
   anything.

464
00:34:45,267 --> 00:34:54,567
Don't take it out on me because
you choked in your interview. 

465
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:56,334
  Hey who said I choked in my
  interview?

466
00:34:56,400 --> 00:35:01,167
Please

467
00:35:01,234 --> 00:35:09,901
Hey fuck you Vandy!  My
interview was fine, I nailed it
 okay?

468
00:35:09,968 --> 00:35:13,767
I'm the best interviewer in the
   world, remember?

469
00:35:41,901 --> 00:35:43,167
 Good morning.

470
00:35:43,234 --> 00:35:44,467
 Good morning.

471
00:35:44,534 --> 00:35:45,501
   Did I sleep late?
   What time is it?

472
00:35:45,567 --> 00:35:47,667
No.  I mean it's okay,
I just got up.

473
00:35:47,734 --> 00:35:56,234
Oh good. Good.
  Oh, you made eggs.

474
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:59,868
  Yeah. I mean you were still
  asleep so.

475
00:35:59,934 --> 00:36:06,000
No no it's fine, I was just - I 
mean I'm glad you made eggs for
 yourself.  I'm fine.

476
00:36:17,801 --> 00:36:21,234
  I'm going to go put on some
clothes.  Do you mind if I don't
shower.

477
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:23,567
   No of course not.

478
00:36:32,801 --> 00:36:39,968
 Uh, Vandy? Do you know where
 that box is with the sweaters
and the pants that uh,

479
00:36:40,033 --> 00:36:42,200
  it was in the bottom of the
 closet I never picked it up.

480
00:36:42,267 --> 00:36:48,634
Yeah, uh that box isn't around
   anymore.

481
00:36:48,701 --> 00:36:50,300
   It's not?

482
00:36:50,367 --> 00:36:52,634
  No.

483
00:36:52,701 --> 00:36:55,367
Is it somewhere else? Existing?

484
00:36:55,434 --> 00:36:57,834
  No.

485
00:36:57,901 --> 00:37:03,934
 Oh.  Okay that, no that's uh,
 that's fine.

486
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:10,534
Um, actually do you still have
that sweatshirt that I gave you?

487
00:37:10,601 --> 00:37:14,934
 Yeah I still have it, it's in
the top dresser drawer.

488
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:19,834
 Right. Okay.

489
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,234
 That embarrasses you?
   Me giving him $3?

490
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:25,667
 Yes because you are a
 representation of me.

491
00:37:25,734 --> 00:37:28,534
I can't believe she said that to
 him.

492
00:37:28,601 --> 00:37:29,834
I know.

493
00:37:29,901 --> 00:37:31,667
I would kill you if you talked
   to me like that.

494
00:37:31,734 --> 00:37:32,801
  Oh shut up.

495
00:37:32,868 --> 00:37:33,868
 You shut up.

496
00:37:33,934 --> 00:37:35,467
You talk to me like that all the
 time.

497
00:37:35,534 --> 00:37:37,767
 Hey I do not! Don't say that.

498
00:37:37,834 --> 00:37:42,501
  What happened with them is
fucked up.  I didn't like that.

499
00:37:42,567 --> 00:37:48,868
 No you're right.  Keith is a
  pretty good dancer.

500
00:37:48,934 --> 00:37:54,033
Look at Delia.

501
00:38:01,834 --> 00:38:04,667
  Alright who made the gravy?

502
00:38:04,734 --> 00:38:07,000
I did. I made the stuffing too,
it's terrific.

503
00:38:07,067 --> 00:38:09,067
 Hey Deal's sweetie, you want
  some gravy?

504
00:38:09,133 --> 00:38:10,801
 No.  It's disgusting.

505
00:38:10,868 --> 00:38:12,834
  You don't like gravy? It's
  delicious.

506
00:38:12,901 --> 00:38:15,400
 I don't eat gravy and I don't
  eat Turkey.

507
00:38:15,467 --> 00:38:17,300
   Okay, do you want to eat
   stuffing?

508
00:38:17,367 --> 00:38:18,434
I eat stuffing.

509
00:38:18,501 --> 00:38:20,834
Okay. Give her a little
   stuffing.

510
00:38:20,901 --> 00:38:23,934
V you don't know how excited I
   am fir this TRIP.

511
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,067
I think I need it as much as you
  do.

512
00:38:26,133 --> 00:38:28,000
  Yeah I'll be great.

513
00:38:28,067 --> 00:38:30,334
Careful with the spelling she's
 getting GOOD.

514
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:35,834
You know what I would actually 
  like to make a toast to the
 Patron Saint Thomas,

515
00:38:35,901 --> 00:38:39,167
thank you for what we are about
  to receive.

516
00:38:39,234 --> 00:38:40,801
That's very clever I like that.

517
00:38:40,868 --> 00:38:44,667
Have you seen Highheeled Shoes
  yet hunny?

518
00:38:44,734 --> 00:38:46,133
No mom.

519
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,467
You should it can be so
  uplifting.

520
00:38:48,534 --> 00:38:50,934
  Does anybody want some more
  white meat?

521
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,133
Oh you know I got you an extra
  um turkey thigh too hunny.

522
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,467
  Thank you.

523
00:38:55,534 --> 00:38:56,767
  You have to keep eating you
 know.

524
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:58,067
 Yeah, I know.

525
00:38:58,133 --> 00:39:00,133
We have eggplant parm coming so.

526
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:03,400
 You know if there's anything
special you liked you just as me
 okay?

527
00:39:03,467 --> 00:39:05,267
 Mom, give me a break.

528
00:39:05,334 --> 00:39:08,901
I think she knows how to eat so.

529
00:39:08,968 --> 00:39:11,934
 But I mean it, just anything.
It's what I'm here for.

530
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,767
 Just stop it.

531
00:39:14,834 --> 00:39:20,534
 You know Van your mother says
these things because she cares
  about you.

532
00:39:20,601 --> 00:39:29,434
Nice job spitting it into your
  napkin hun.

533
00:39:29,501 --> 00:39:32,167
 I don't like stuffing either.

534
00:39:32,234 --> 00:39:34,968
 What! You loved the stuffing
 last year.  You remember how
 much you ate?

535
00:39:35,033 --> 00:39:36,701
Emma -

536
00:39:36,767 --> 00:39:39,200
Huh? No, do you remember?  You
said "I want to eat stuffing all
  the time".

537
00:39:39,267 --> 00:39:40,167
 Emma

538
00:39:40,234 --> 00:39:42,167
 What?

539
00:39:42,234 --> 00:39:43,501
 PETER made the stuffing last
 year.

540
00:39:43,567 --> 00:39:46,701
   Did you just spell Peter?

541
00:39:46,767 --> 00:39:48,734
 Yes I did, that is very good.

542
00:39:48,801 --> 00:39:51,667
You know there's a Peter in her
  class that's how she knows.

543
00:39:51,734 --> 00:39:53,567
  That's not how I know I can
 read!

544
00:39:53,634 --> 00:39:55,367
No I know, hun.

545
00:39:55,434 --> 00:39:57,868
Is Peter coming today?

546
00:39:57,934 --> 00:39:59,834
 Who hunny, the Peter in your
class?

547
00:39:59,901 --> 00:40:02,267
 No, Vandy's husband.

548
00:40:02,334 --> 00:40:05,834
 You know what hunny they were
never actually married.

549
00:40:05,901 --> 00:40:07,801
   Emma, what are you doing?

550
00:40:07,868 --> 00:40:08,734
 What!

551
00:40:08,801 --> 00:40:10,634
  No hunny he's not.

552
00:40:10,701 --> 00:40:11,968
 Why?

553
00:40:12,033 --> 00:40:15,367
Because he doesn't realize what
   a commitment is.

554
00:40:15,434 --> 00:40:16,934
 Mom.

555
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,367
You know what, he just couldn't
   make it.

556
00:40:19,434 --> 00:40:22,734
Will Pete make the stuffing next
 year?

557
00:40:22,801 --> 00:40:26,767
  You know the more you make
 things up the more question's
   you're gonna get.

558
00:40:26,834 --> 00:40:31,367
  Peter and I aren't friends
   anymore.

559
00:40:31,434 --> 00:40:33,167
 Why?

560
00:40:33,234 --> 00:40:39,167
 You know what, hunny.  Peter
wanted to be friends with other
people

561
00:40:39,234 --> 00:40:41,400
while he was friends with Vandy
and you're not really allowed -

562
00:40:41,467 --> 00:40:43,234
  Emma - what are you doing?

563
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:44,234
Well -

564
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:45,734
  You can have more than one
friend

565
00:40:45,801 --> 00:40:47,234
 That's exactly right sweetie.

566
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:49,400
  Yeah but Peter wanted to be
 friends with this one person,

567
00:40:49,467 --> 00:40:50,834
and he wasn't really allowed to
 be friends -

568
00:40:50,901 --> 00:40:52,767
Okay that is not why everything
   happened.

569
00:40:52,834 --> 00:40:54,734
 Peter just wasn't a very nice
person.

570
00:40:54,801 --> 00:41:00,267
Mom! Honestly!  Sorry.

571
00:41:00,334 --> 00:41:11,133
   Peter was a nice person,
   didn't you think?

572
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,033
 Yes.

573
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:16,367
Yeah, he was nice.  I don't know
why we're not friends anymore.

574
00:41:16,434 --> 00:41:18,133
 He was funny.

575
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:22,634
Yeah he is funny.  He's a good
person and he didn't do anything
wrong.

576
00:41:22,701 --> 00:41:23,968
 Jesus Christ.

577
00:41:24,033 --> 00:41:27,100
 Mom.

578
00:41:35,067 --> 00:41:38,434
  No one did anything wrong.

579
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,400
 Hey.

580
00:41:43,467 --> 00:41:44,968
 You alright?

581
00:41:45,033 --> 00:41:46,167
 Yeah.

582
00:41:46,234 --> 00:41:52,601
Nervous? Everyone seems to love
 your painter.

583
00:41:52,667 --> 00:41:56,334
Yeah I know I sold two more of
her paintings.

584
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:01,534
 Wow, that's amazing.
 Hey should I buy one?

585
00:42:01,601 --> 00:42:03,467
   Do you like them?

586
00:42:03,534 --> 00:42:06,601
Uh yeah, yeah.

587
00:42:06,667 --> 00:42:11,100
  You don't have to buy one.

588
00:42:11,167 --> 00:42:12,634
   You sure?

589
00:42:12,701 --> 00:42:13,968
 Yeah.

590
00:42:14,033 --> 00:42:16,968
Are you happy?

591
00:42:17,033 --> 00:42:18,400
  Of course.

592
00:42:18,467 --> 00:42:21,934
  Well you should be.

593
00:42:29,567 --> 00:42:34,801
Do you want to meet my parents? 
They're going to be in town next
   weekend.

594
00:42:34,868 --> 00:42:38,434
Yeah, I should.

595
00:42:38,501 --> 00:42:39,901
I don't want to twist your arm.

596
00:42:39,968 --> 00:42:42,234
  No, fine, it's fine. Yeah.

597
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:43,901
We'll go for a dinner.

598
00:42:43,968 --> 00:42:47,567
 'Kay.  I'll find us a place.
   Where do you want to go?

599
00:42:47,634 --> 00:42:49,434
 No, no, no, my secretary will
  take care of that.

600
00:42:49,501 --> 00:42:53,067
She gets hooked up everywhere so
we are all set.

601
00:42:53,133 --> 00:42:55,767
Ooh I am gonna grab a couple of
these.

602
00:42:55,834 --> 00:43:06,601
This is a great night for you.
   Congrats.

603
00:43:06,667 --> 00:43:15,000
I think I am going to buy one of
  these pictures. Portraits.

604
00:43:15,067 --> 00:43:20,200
I don't want you to buy one of
   these paintings.

605
00:43:20,267 --> 00:43:23,000
  No I would like to.

606
00:43:23,067 --> 00:43:28,367
Okay if you - whatever - if you
see a painting and you like it,
great.

607
00:43:28,434 --> 00:43:31,868
  Is that a problem?

608
00:43:31,934 --> 00:43:35,267
I don't want you to buy one to
   be nice.

609
00:43:35,334 --> 00:43:37,367
   Why not?

610
00:43:37,434 --> 00:43:39,901
   'Cause that's insulting.

611
00:43:43,567 --> 00:43:45,234
 What?

612
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:49,934
Nothing.  You know what, you've
got a lot of people you need to
talk to tonight

613
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,033
so I think that I am gonna go.

614
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:57,467
   No Andrew I want to know.
If you're angry you can tell me.

615
00:43:57,534 --> 00:44:00,501
I know, I know.

616
00:44:00,567 --> 00:44:06,501
No, you know it was my bad.  It
was my bad so, uh, this is your
night,

617
00:44:06,567 --> 00:44:12,133
you know actually no, it is my
 bad, that was my bad.

618
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:21,834
   I'll stop by your office
   tomorrow afternoon, okay?
We can get lunch or something.

619
00:44:21,901 --> 00:44:23,634
   I can't I start jury duty
   tomorrow.

620
00:44:23,701 --> 00:44:27,133
 That's right.

621
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:27,934
Sorry.

622
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:44,067
  **

623
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:56,968
 Hey.

624
00:44:57,033 --> 00:44:58,934
Hey. Uh, Peter.

625
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,200
  Yeah.  Hello Vandy.

626
00:45:01,267 --> 00:45:02,767
How's it going?

627
00:45:02,834 --> 00:45:04,400
   Umm, not so bad.

628
00:45:04,467 --> 00:45:10,400
Good to hear.  Alright well, it
  was good seeing ya.

629
00:45:10,467 --> 00:45:12,267
You still on that case?

630
00:45:12,334 --> 00:45:13,934
 Almost done.

631
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:19,601
Awesome. Listen Vandy, this is
going to sound a little out of
nowhere but uh,

632
00:45:19,667 --> 00:45:23,133
Before you say anything I should
 tell you I'm dating someone.

633
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:26,767
Okay.  I wasn't going to ask you
out on a date.

634
00:45:26,834 --> 00:45:28,868
  Oh.

635
00:45:28,934 --> 00:45:33,334
  But you're not that far off
base. I told you this was out of
  nowhere, we only met once,

636
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:36,133
 but I have something for you.

637
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:38,400
  Oh?

638
00:45:38,467 --> 00:45:44,167
It's not like it's a body part
 or something, okay, I'm not a
 stalker or a.

639
00:45:44,234 --> 00:45:54,267
And I realize that you're dating
someone, that's fine, but you'll
   see it's really nothing.

640
00:45:54,334 --> 00:46:01,801
Here it is.  It's the crossword
   puzzle from two days ago.

641
00:46:01,868 --> 00:46:06,701
 I was doing it and there was
this clue "Southern university
  for short,"

642
00:46:06,767 --> 00:46:12,167
and the answer was Vandy.  Short
for Vanderbilt.

643
00:46:12,234 --> 00:46:17,067
I actually finished that puzzle
 and Vandy was one of the last
   ones I filled out

644
00:46:17,133 --> 00:46:27,367
and I was like, 'Hey!' And truth
 be told you'd run through my
  mind more than a few times

645
00:46:27,434 --> 00:46:32,934
since that day I met you and uh,
and then the puzzle so I took a
chance.

646
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:38,834
I thought you said you finished
  it.

647
00:46:38,901 --> 00:46:42,701
Yeah.  I, well I picked up a new
   one at the deli.

648
00:46:42,767 --> 00:46:48,801
That way you can just fill out
 Vandy, or the whole thing, or
leave it blank,

649
00:46:48,868 --> 00:46:51,968
or crumple it up and put it in
the garbage like you're probably
   going to.

650
00:46:52,033 --> 00:46:56,567
 It was just a random thing. I
 thought of you when I saw it

651
00:46:56,634 --> 00:47:03,067
 and I understand that you're.
  I'm sorry.

652
00:47:03,133 --> 00:47:14,300
No there's no need to apologize.
  This is. Thank you.

653
00:47:14,367 --> 00:47:24,267
   Well uh, I, I should go.

654
00:47:24,334 --> 00:47:28,334
   No, yeah, yeah of course.

655
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:32,567
Giving up that easily?

656
00:47:32,634 --> 00:47:40,133
   Do you like Indian food?

657
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:41,701
 Yeah.

658
00:47:41,767 --> 00:47:45,467
 Okay do you know that street
with all the Indian restaurants
on it?

659
00:47:45,534 --> 00:47:47,701
  Curry Row?

660
00:47:47,767 --> 00:47:52,701
Yes. Curry Row.  Would you like
 to go to one of those places
   with me?

661
00:47:52,767 --> 00:47:56,300
  Which one?

662
00:48:09,467 --> 00:48:14,434
  Hi.

663
00:48:14,501 --> 00:48:16,834
  Hi.

664
00:48:16,901 --> 00:48:18,601
 Did you design this?

665
00:48:18,667 --> 00:48:23,367
Uh yeah, it was actually my idea
to make the whole thing entirely
 out of glass.

666
00:48:23,434 --> 00:48:25,267
   Oh cool.

667
00:48:25,334 --> 00:48:32,300
No I'm kidding I just make the
models.  No I hate those glass
pieces of shit.

668
00:48:32,367 --> 00:48:33,567
Really?

669
00:48:33,634 --> 00:48:36,100
Yeah.  But that's all they make
so, they're everywhere.

670
00:48:36,167 --> 00:48:38,734
Yeah, no I can't stand the sight
   of them.

671
00:48:38,801 --> 00:48:45,033
 I'm Michelle.

672
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:46,834
 Hi Michelle.

673
00:48:46,901 --> 00:48:51,434
  So you really enjoy working
 here.

674
00:48:51,501 --> 00:48:58,267
I do actually.  I'm kidding.  No
 I'm actually interviewing but
  don't say anything.

675
00:48:58,334 --> 00:49:01,734
  Oh I won't.  I just started
 here.

676
00:49:01,801 --> 00:49:03,167
   Oh yeah?

677
00:49:03,234 --> 00:49:07,400
Do you know of any good places
  to eat around here?

678
00:49:07,467 --> 00:49:09,801
I was looking for like a really
good BBQ place.

679
00:49:09,868 --> 00:49:14,634
Oh well I don't know of a lot of
 really good BBQ places around
 here,

680
00:49:14,701 --> 00:49:17,767
 but there's a great barbeque
 place that's not so far away.

681
00:49:17,834 --> 00:49:21,868
   Are you making fun of me?
  You're lucky you're funny.

682
00:49:21,934 --> 00:49:26,300
 Thank you I uh, I like making
  people LOL.

683
00:49:26,367 --> 00:49:28,767
 Oh my god, whatever.

00:49:28,834 --> 00:49:36,267
 Let me, let me help you with
those.

685
00:49:36,334 --> 00:49:37,934
  I seriously think I got it.

686
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,300
No no I can take them. I'll just
take them to the files.

687
00:49:40,367 --> 00:49:42,067
  I've got it really.

688
00:49:42,133 --> 00:49:43,734
Just give me some of the files.

689
00:49:43,801 --> 00:49:48,100
Alright, four whiskies.

00:49:48,167 --> 00:49:55,167

00:49:55,234 --> 00:49:57,033
   Come on!

692
00:49:57,100 --> 00:50:03,267
It's mine an Marissa's
 anniversary tomorrow.

00:50:03,334 --> 00:50:05,434
 To Paul and.

694
00:50:05,501 --> 00:50:08,334
 Marissa, her name is Marissa.

695
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:10,033
I'm joking, I'm joking.

696
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:11,767
I'm telling her.  All that shit
  you said, I'm telling her.

697
00:50:11,834 --> 00:50:15,434
   Woah, woah, woah, you and
   Marissa are okay, right?

698
00:50:15,501 --> 00:50:17,801
   Yeah man.

699
00:50:17,868 --> 00:50:20,767
Well what we were talking about
  last week.

700
00:50:20,834 --> 00:50:22,901
 I mea, don't worry about it.

701
00:50:22,968 --> 00:50:25,734
Well I just didn't want to toast
 if you guys.

702
00:50:25,801 --> 00:50:27,133
  We're fine man, don't worry
   about it.

703
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:31,434
 Cool, cool.  Cheers.

704
00:50:41,033 --> 00:50:42,801
   Forget about it.

705
00:50:42,868 --> 00:50:47,133
Okay. You guys are not splitting
up.  You guys are going to stay
   together.

706
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:51,801
Yes. And could you pretend that
 I didn't say anything to you.

707
00:50:51,868 --> 00:50:53,067
   Yeah. Yes I can.

708
00:50:53,133 --> 00:50:54,467
   'Cause you know she can.

709
00:50:54,534 --> 00:51:01,067
I do.  Good, oh good.  I am so
happy.  That is fucking awesome.

710
00:51:01,133 --> 00:51:02,834
  Okay, okay.

711
00:51:02,901 --> 00:51:05,534
 No I'm serious.  When you're
with someone it always comes to
  that point

712
00:51:05,601 --> 00:51:08,300
   where you just gotta work
  through that stuff.

713
00:51:08,367 --> 00:51:11,467
 I got it man, I got it, I got
  it.  How you doing?

714
00:51:11,534 --> 00:51:16,934
I'm a little fucked up.
  I'm sorry I'm acting like a
  douche bag.

715
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:27,434
 Keith? Keith. Keith!

716
00:51:27,501 --> 00:51:31,100
Is that Keith?

717
00:51:31,167 --> 00:51:33,033
  Keith? How are you?

718
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:34,734
 I'm sorry, I'm not -

719
00:51:34,801 --> 00:51:36,901
How is everyone?  How's Delia?

720
00:51:36,968 --> 00:51:38,534
I don't know what you're talking
about.

721
00:51:38,601 --> 00:51:39,934
   Have you talked to Vandy?

722
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,901
 No I haven't talked to Vandy.

723
00:51:41,968 --> 00:51:45,734
Will you just tell Emma to tell
 her, I was trying to tell her
  but she just won't.

724
00:51:45,801 --> 00:51:48,868
  It wasn't about this other
   person, okay?  It was all

725
00:51:48,934 --> 00:51:50,968
HeY listen man, I'm not

726
00:51:51,033 --> 00:51:54,100
No no, it was about us and our
shit, and that's even what she
 was saying -

727
00:51:54,167 --> 00:51:55,367
  Did she? Oh really?

728
00:51:55,434 --> 00:51:56,868
And I didn't even fucking sleep
with the other person -

729
00:51:56,934 --> 00:51:59,567
  You didn't?
No! No.
  You didn't sleep with her?

730
00:51:59,634 --> 00:52:02,100
 No I did not!
 And she - You slept with her?
 No I did not

731
00:52:02,167 --> 00:52:04,167
 Yes you did.
   I - Keith
   I can tell he did

732
00:52:04,234 --> 00:52:06,300
  Listen Keith you know me, I
 wouldn't sleep with anybody.

733
00:52:06,367 --> 00:52:07,501
  She wouldn't listen to me.

734
00:52:07,567 --> 00:52:09,434
  Dude listen to me.

735
00:52:09,501 --> 00:52:10,801
 What?

736
00:52:10,868 --> 00:52:15,701
I'm not Keith.  I'm not Keith. 
   I don't know you.

737
00:52:15,767 --> 00:52:18,033
   That ain't Keith.

738
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:21,167
 Am I losing my mind?
That guy looks a lot like Keith.

739
00:52:21,234 --> 00:52:22,868
  He looks a lot like him but
   that's not Keith.

740
00:52:22,934 --> 00:52:26,968
 He looks like Keith.

741
00:52:27,033 --> 00:52:29,734
 He looks exactly like Keith! 
 I'm really sorry man.

742
00:52:29,801 --> 00:52:30,734
  It's cool.

743
00:52:30,801 --> 00:52:33,100
 I'm sorry that was fucked up
though.

744
00:52:33,167 --> 00:52:36,167
 Yeah that was a little fucked
up, umm I didn't know how that
was going to work out.

745
00:52:36,234 --> 00:52:38,701
 Yeah well I swear to God you
 look exactly like my
brother-in-law,

746
00:52:38,767 --> 00:52:40,467
or this guy who was going to be
  my brother-in-law.

747
00:52:40,534 --> 00:52:41,467
  He looks like him.

748
00:52:41,534 --> 00:52:44,767
   Wow. Okay. That is. Wow.

749
00:52:44,834 --> 00:52:48,868
That guys was fucking with me.

750
00:52:48,934 --> 00:52:51,767
 No he wasn't you were fucking
with him.  He told you he wasn't
Keith.

751
00:52:51,834 --> 00:52:53,033
   He pretended to be Keith.

752
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:54,133
 He wasn't pretending.

753
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:55,367
  He was pretending.

754
00:52:55,434 --> 00:52:57,133
Sit your ass down, what's wrong
   with you.

755
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:59,567
  Hey hey hey hey hey

756
00:52:59,634 --> 00:53:01,534
You wish you were Keith. Keith's
  a pretty fucking cool guy.

757
00:53:01,601 --> 00:53:10,701
  I got an email from my mom
saying that Highheeled Shoes is
   a terrific movie

758
00:53:10,767 --> 00:53:13,234
  and that we should see it.

759
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:17,234
That's the one with the southern
 bell with five southern bell
  daughters.

760
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:19,167
  Interested?

761
00:53:19,234 --> 00:53:22,100
  I'd rather have my scrotum
  nailed to a chair.

762
00:53:22,167 --> 00:53:29,934
 Oh she also wanted to know if
you wanted to make that stuffing
for Thanksgiving again.

763
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,834
  Does she need to know now?

764
00:53:32,901 --> 00:53:38,300
  Well do you want to make it
 or... uh she needs to

765
00:53:38,367 --> 00:53:43,534
  going to take my dad to the
 dermatologist and it's right
  next to the specialty store

766
00:53:43,601 --> 00:53:45,200
where was going to order some of

767
00:53:45,267 --> 00:53:46,968
 Can I just call her?

768
00:53:47,033 --> 00:53:49,000
 Yeah

769
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:57,000
 Time for bed.

770
00:53:57,067 --> 00:53:59,067
I'm not ready for bed.

771
00:53:59,133 --> 00:54:02,133
  Come on we've got a big day
   tomorrow.

772
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:08,534
I don't want you falling asleep
   out here again.  Come on.

773
00:54:08,601 --> 00:54:11,133
Why don't you stay here and talk
to me.

774
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:15,234
  We can talk in bed.

775
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:17,801
 I don't want to talk in bed.

776
00:54:28,167 --> 00:54:33,701
 So.  What's going on?

777
00:54:33,767 --> 00:54:42,000
  Um

778
00:54:42,067 --> 00:54:46,501
 I thought you wanted to talk.

779
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:56,033
   I'm going to the bedroom.

780
00:54:56,100 --> 00:54:58,868
 I'm not happy Vandy.

781
00:54:58,934 --> 00:55:02,701
Yeah about like work and stuff?

782
00:55:02,767 --> 00:55:04,100
  Everything

783
00:55:04,167 --> 00:55:07,667
Oh, can I help?

784
00:55:07,734 --> 00:55:14,834
 I don't know.  I haven't been
too happy here either.

785
00:55:14,901 --> 00:55:25,667
 I don't know if I want to do
 this anymore.

786
00:55:25,734 --> 00:55:28,634
Nobody does this for no reason. 
   Was there somebody else?

787
00:55:28,701 --> 00:55:34,934
  No! That's not, you're not,
 that's - no - that's not what
this is about.

788
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:40,601
Okay, sometimes I think it just
comes down to whether or not two
  people should be together.

789
00:55:40,667 --> 00:55:43,033
You don't think that we should
 be together?

790
00:55:43,100 --> 00:55:45,601
  I don't know. I don't know
Vandy.

791
00:55:45,667 --> 00:55:48,767
I mean the way we are now, no. 
I don't want to be with you like
 this.

792
00:55:54,601 --> 00:55:57,000
   Can you give me a reason?

793
00:55:57,067 --> 00:56:00,100
I thought about this recently.

794
00:56:00,167 --> 00:56:06,000
 I've been around a lot of new
 people through work and it's
   like I'm

795
00:56:06,067 --> 00:56:10,300
all these things are coming out
   of me all this stuff um,

796
00:56:10,367 --> 00:56:16,100
 it's me, it's everything that
  reminds me of who I am, me,

797
00:56:16,167 --> 00:56:28,501
and I haven't felt like that in
  a long time.  I'm not that
   person with you.

798
00:56:28,567 --> 00:56:36,000
I think I used to be like that
with you but you've been trying
to kill it ever since.

799
00:56:36,067 --> 00:56:38,667
It's like you're trying to kill
  me.

800
00:56:38,734 --> 00:56:41,033
  I'm not trying to kill you
Peter.

801
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:43,234
Not literally it's just me, who
 I am.

802
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:50,067
Ever since the day we met it's
like, I mean that's exactly what
 it feels like to me.

803
00:56:50,133 --> 00:56:58,734
And it's not just you I mean I'm
sure I do it too but I need to
  be able to feel me.

804
00:56:58,801 --> 00:57:05,100
 I feel like I've been asleep.

805
00:57:05,167 --> 00:57:12,701
A couple weeks ago remember that
you were acting really nice to
   me and genuinely

806
00:57:12,767 --> 00:57:17,934
   and I felt uncomfortable.

807
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:23,801
Like I was outside of my comfort
  zone with you being loving
  towards me.

808
00:57:30,934 --> 00:57:33,968
   It made me feel horrible.

809
00:57:34,067 --> 00:57:39,367
  I didn't want it to be like
 this.

810
00:57:39,434 --> 00:57:41,234
I didn't want it to be like this
either.

811
00:58:04,767 --> 00:58:07,567
 Don't ever leave me.
 Don't ever leave me.

812
00:58:07,634 --> 00:58:09,133
  I'm not going to leave you.

813
00:58:25,033 --> 00:58:26,467
Peter.

814
00:58:26,534 --> 00:58:31,033
 Yeah?

815
00:58:31,100 --> 00:58:36,067
Is there someone else?

816
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:46,100
Is there someone else?

817
00:58:46,167 --> 00:58:49,834
  It wasn't anything

818
00:58:49,901 --> 00:58:51,133
  Oh my god!

819
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:51,901
 Vandy

820
00:58:51,968 --> 00:58:52,801
  Oh my god!

821
00:58:52,868 --> 00:58:54,033
No, no.  Listen it was nothing.

822
00:58:54,100 --> 00:58:55,701
 Don't you, don't you fucking
   touch me!

823
00:58:55,767 --> 00:58:57,000
   Vandy, calm down

824
00:58:57,067 --> 00:58:58,567
   Holy shit

825
00:58:58,634 --> 00:59:00,234
Listen to me.  The problems that
we have are between us.

826
00:59:00,300 --> 00:59:02,000
   Nothing happened!

827
00:59:02,067 --> 00:59:03,801
Shit I knew it.

828
00:59:03,868 --> 00:59:06,200
Don't do this okay we got so far
  last night because I didn't
 bring it up.

829
00:59:06,267 --> 00:59:08,033
   Let's just talk about it.

830
00:59:08,100 --> 00:59:09,300
Get the fuck out oh my god get
 out of here.

831
00:59:09,367 --> 00:59:10,534
 Like we talked about it last
night!

832
00:59:10,601 --> 00:59:11,701
No, no, no, no. Just get out of
here get the fuck out.

833
00:59:11,767 --> 00:59:12,501
 Please don't do this.

834
00:59:12,567 --> 00:59:14,501
 Back up! Get Get out!

835
00:59:14,567 --> 00:59:15,067
   Alright.

836
00:59:27,434 --> 00:59:30,968
Okay here's a question for you. 
The crossword puzzle. You said
   you finished it.

837
00:59:31,033 --> 00:59:32,267
I did.

838
00:59:32,334 --> 00:59:33,767
 What day of the week was it?

839
00:59:33,834 --> 00:59:35,701
  It was a Saturday.

840
00:59:35,767 --> 00:59:37,868
  Oh that's the toughest one,
right?

841
00:59:37,934 --> 00:59:42,634
   Yeah.  My mom always does
crossword puzzles so I've been
  doing them forever.

842
00:59:42,701 --> 00:59:44,968
I am impressed.

843
00:59:45,033 --> 00:59:49,200
  Yeah no, yeah it's a really
productive way of spending your
 time.

844
00:59:49,267 --> 00:59:52,300
Do you do crossword puzzles or.

845
00:59:52,367 --> 00:59:57,167
 No, that's good, so we don't
   have to fight over them.

846
00:59:57,234 --> 01:00:04,033
 So I hope you didn't have to
change your schedule around too
  much to uh.

847
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:05,200
   To what?

848
01:00:05,267 --> 01:00:07,300
  For dinner.

849
01:00:07,367 --> 01:00:08,834
 A little bit.

850
01:00:08,901 --> 01:00:13,934
Yeah.  I just meant uh, nothing
really.

851
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,634
You mean did I tell the guy I'm
seeing?

852
01:00:16,701 --> 01:00:27,300
No, well no that's not what I. 
That's not what I was expecting
  you to say.

853
01:00:27,367 --> 01:00:33,234
I guess I was saying more like
did you have a date that you had
   to break off with him or.

854
01:00:33,300 --> 01:00:37,634
I really was trying not to talk
about this more than anything,

855
01:00:37,701 --> 01:00:39,400
and here I am just talking about
  it.

856
01:00:39,467 --> 01:00:41,033
 Okay.

857
01:00:41,100 --> 01:00:42,367
  I'm sorry.

858
01:00:42,434 --> 01:00:44,200
 No it's okay.

859
01:00:44,267 --> 01:00:49,334
Sorry but you said you changed
your plans a little bit, though

860
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:51,801
Do you want to be talking about
it or.

861
01:00:51,868 --> 01:00:56,133
I guess I do..?

862
01:00:56,200 --> 01:01:01,934
Um, well I was supposed to meet
up with him later but instead I
  broke up with him.

863
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:10,901
 Oh, wow.  Are you regretting
   that yet?

864
01:01:10,968 --> 01:01:17,067
 Yeah.  No.  I wasn't thrilled
with the way things were going
   with him anyway.

865
01:01:17,133 --> 01:01:20,434
No, well, of course - I'm sorry
I wasn't implying that you did
   it because of me.

866
01:01:20,501 --> 01:01:24,200
  That's okay.  And it really
 wasn't that nasty a break up.

867
01:01:24,267 --> 01:01:26,400
  So if this date goes really
 badly

868
01:01:26,467 --> 01:01:28,634
I think I still have a shot of
getting back together with him.

869
01:01:28,701 --> 01:01:30,000
   Good one.

870
01:01:30,067 --> 01:01:31,400
Thanks.

871
01:01:31,467 --> 01:01:34,467
 Sorry I brought all this up. 
It's stupid I'm sorry.

872
01:01:34,534 --> 01:01:37,667
No why do you always..

873
01:01:37,734 --> 01:01:39,534
 What?

874
01:01:39,601 --> 01:01:43,701
 It's nothing.

875
01:01:43,767 --> 01:01:48,167
  No tell me please.

876
01:01:48,234 --> 01:01:51,033
   Well you apologize a lot.

877
01:01:51,100 --> 01:01:55,667
 Do I?

878
01:01:55,734 --> 01:01:57,767
  Little bit.

879
01:01:57,834 --> 01:02:05,701
Sorry about that.  I'm kidding.
   No I know what you mean.

880
01:02:05,767 --> 01:02:08,267
 I'm not saying it like it's a
   problem.

881
01:02:08,334 --> 01:02:13,000
  No it's fine trust me it's
 something that I'm aware of.

882
01:02:13,067 --> 01:02:16,567
I feel like a jerkoff when I do
  it.

883
01:02:16,634 --> 01:02:18,234
  No that's not what I meant.

884
01:02:18,300 --> 01:02:22,801
No. It's fine. I mean it.  You
know what I think it is
   actually?

885
01:02:22,868 --> 01:02:25,801
Tell me what you think because
I'm not, I'm not too sure myself
 but,

886
01:02:25,868 --> 01:02:30,767
 no I think I apologize a lot
   when I'm.

887
01:02:30,834 --> 01:02:34,367
   Not really sorry?

888
01:02:34,434 --> 01:02:37,033
That too. Yeah.

889
01:02:37,100 --> 01:02:41,367
 I no, I wasn't trying to turn
 this into a nitpick session.

890
01:02:41,434 --> 01:02:46,167
I don't know Jesus even on our
  first date.

891
01:02:46,234 --> 01:02:48,167
 No please are you kidding me?

892
01:02:48,234 --> 01:02:54,334
This is exactly what I'm this is
the kind of stuff I would always
want you to tell me if we were,

893
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:59,701
 um, no I'm glad you said it. 
  Seriously.

894
01:02:59,767 --> 01:03:03,000
Like I said I like to knock it
off so.

895
01:03:03,067 --> 01:03:10,934
Not a problem, honestly, bring
it on!

896
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:17,667
I am really glad I'm here with
 you.

897
01:03:17,734 --> 01:03:22,133
   So am I.

898
01:03:24,033 --> 01:03:25,501
  No.

899
01:03:25,567 --> 01:03:26,167
Nuhuh.

900
01:03:26,234 --> 01:03:27,300
   I insist.

901
01:03:27,367 --> 01:03:28,501
 I have it.  Give me a break.

902
01:03:28,567 --> 01:03:29,801
 You got me a present.

903
01:03:29,868 --> 01:03:31,400
 The crossword puzzle?

904
01:03:31,467 --> 01:03:32,534
 Yeah.

905
01:03:32,601 --> 01:03:34,300
You do realize that the New York
 Times is $1?

906
01:03:34,367 --> 01:03:35,834
 Yeah but you had to get two.

907
01:03:35,901 --> 01:03:38,200
   Oh. You're right.
   It was a $2 gift.

908
01:03:38,267 --> 01:03:43,067
Would it make you feel better if
   you left the tip?

909
01:03:43,133 --> 01:03:45,000
 Fine.

910
01:03:45,067 --> 01:03:48,601
Okay.  You take care of the tip.

911
01:03:48,667 --> 01:03:51,934
   You're terrific.

912
01:04:09,067 --> 01:04:10,834
What do you think it was about?

913
01:04:10,901 --> 01:04:14,634
  Paul is a very good tipper.

914
01:04:14,701 --> 01:04:15,934
 No seriously.

915
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,400
Vandy, they've always been like
  that from day one.

916
01:04:18,467 --> 01:04:21,501
 They can't stay together like
 that.

917
01:04:21,567 --> 01:04:24,901
 All Paul wanted to do was tip
   the guy.

918
01:04:24,968 --> 01:04:29,567
Yeah you're not really supposed
to tip at these things.  She's
right actually.

919
01:04:29,634 --> 01:04:31,567
   Are you serious?

920
01:04:31,634 --> 01:04:32,434
 Yeah.

921
01:04:32,501 --> 01:04:33,634
   You're an idiot.

922
01:04:33,701 --> 01:04:35,534
   You're an idiot.

923
01:04:35,601 --> 01:04:38,300
 What's it like being the less
   intelligent person in the
 relationship?

924
01:04:38,367 --> 01:04:41,667
   Good one.

925
01:04:41,734 --> 01:04:42,634
  Seriously.

926
01:04:42,701 --> 01:04:43,968
   Fuck off.

927
01:04:44,033 --> 01:04:45,868
Maybe you and Keith should form
   a support group.

928
01:04:45,934 --> 01:04:50,200
You know I am starving. Do you
mind if we just go home

929
01:04:50,267 --> 01:04:53,567
  and you can make me a nice
peanut butter and jelly
   sandwich.

930
01:04:53,634 --> 01:04:58,767
   No because I just ran the
 dishwasher so there should be
  enough silverware for you.

931
01:05:04,734 --> 01:05:09,033
Would you like to dance with me?

932
01:05:16,601 --> 01:05:18,734
Have they always been like that?

933
01:05:18,801 --> 01:05:21,367
   They fought at their own
   wedding.

934
01:05:21,434 --> 01:05:24,267
   Like we just saw?

935
01:05:24,334 --> 01:05:26,000
 Maybe worse.

936
01:05:26,067 --> 01:05:31,834
Jesus.  Why are they together? 
Does Paul talk to you about this
stuff?

937
01:05:31,901 --> 01:05:33,334
  No.

938
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:35,667
  That is so annoying to me.

939
01:05:35,734 --> 01:05:43,868
 Can I tell you something you
promise you won't tell anyone?

940
01:05:43,934 --> 01:05:45,968
  I promise.

941
01:05:46,033 --> 01:05:47,501
Promise you won't tell.

942
01:05:47,567 --> 01:05:49,267
Oh my god just fucking tell me.

943
01:05:49,334 --> 01:05:56,100
 There was this one time where
Paul told me that he was gonna
  leave her.

944
01:05:56,167 --> 01:06:01,400
  Shut up.  What did you say?

945
01:06:01,467 --> 01:06:04,267
  I told him not too.

946
01:06:04,334 --> 01:06:06,567
Really?

947
01:06:06,634 --> 01:06:08,000
 Yeah.

948
01:06:08,067 --> 01:06:08,868
 Why?

949
01:06:08,934 --> 01:06:10,133
 I don't know.

950
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:14,300
I can't believe you never told
   me that.

951
01:06:14,367 --> 01:06:16,234
 Yeah.

952
01:06:16,300 --> 01:06:18,167
I mean jeeze what the hell do we
 have to talk about you don't
  tell me that story?

953
01:06:18,234 --> 01:06:19,367
He told me not to say anything.

954
01:06:19,434 --> 01:06:20,767
  So what you tell me anyway.

955
01:06:20,834 --> 01:06:22,167
I know.

956
01:06:22,234 --> 01:06:28,334
God that is so juicy. Seriously
 why didn't you tell me that?

957
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:36,100
 I would have told you it just
  happened during last year.

958
01:06:36,167 --> 01:06:38,133
 Yeah.

959
01:06:38,200 --> 01:06:43,501
I just mean it happened during
winter.

960
01:06:43,567 --> 01:06:49,934
  Oh.

961
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:55,601
  I love you.

962
01:06:55,667 --> 01:06:56,501
   Whatever.

963
01:06:56,567 --> 01:06:57,534
   Come on.

964
01:06:57,601 --> 01:06:59,100
 You come on.

965
01:07:20,334 --> 01:07:23,634
  I'm sorry.

966
01:07:27,467 --> 01:07:29,601
So you and Paul you have a lot
in common huh.

967
01:07:29,667 --> 01:07:31,601
   What do you mean?

968
01:07:31,667 --> 01:07:36,601
 Is Paul seeing someone else?

969
01:07:36,667 --> 01:07:40,100
  I don't believe so.

970
01:07:40,167 --> 01:07:42,667
Oh that wasn't why you wanted to
leave her then.

971
01:07:42,734 --> 01:07:44,367
  No.

972
01:07:44,434 --> 01:07:47,934
Well you're so good at it maybe
you should have given him some
 of your tips

973
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:49,367
  on breaking up with people.

974
01:07:49,434 --> 01:07:58,300
I made a huge mistake I'm sorry.
 I still - I'm sorry.

975
01:07:58,367 --> 01:08:00,767
   I don't want to hear you
  apologize.

976
01:08:00,834 --> 01:08:05,901
  Well I don't have any tips
 because I've never broken up
 with anyone.

977
01:08:05,968 --> 01:08:07,067
Really?

978
01:08:07,133 --> 01:08:09,701
  It's hard to believe isn't?

979
01:08:09,767 --> 01:08:11,601
 Well I know a stud like you.

980
01:08:11,667 --> 01:08:14,767
   But I mean it.  Seriously
though.

981
01:08:14,834 --> 01:08:15,801
   Oh yeah.

982
01:08:15,868 --> 01:08:17,033
Honest to God.

983
01:08:17,100 --> 01:08:18,334
  You are pushing it.

984
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:20,634
 I had a couple girlfriends in
high school and college

985
01:08:20,701 --> 01:08:22,734
 and they all just fizzled out
there were no actual break ups.

986
01:08:22,801 --> 01:08:24,367
   You're gonna keep going.

987
01:08:24,434 --> 01:08:30,067
 And then I got dumped once or
twice. Then I met you. And here
we are.

988
01:08:30,133 --> 01:08:35,901
 Here we are.

989
01:08:35,968 --> 01:08:40,367
 Here we are.

990
01:08:45,434 --> 01:08:51,434
Are there any other things you
have to do to get ready for your
 trip?

991
01:08:51,501 --> 01:08:57,334
We could just take it slow try
to work through things.

992
01:08:57,400 --> 01:09:04,501
I'm sorry.  You told me to stop
apologizing. I don't know why I
keep doing it.

993
01:09:04,567 --> 01:09:07,000
  I'm not acting like myself.

994
01:09:10,901 --> 01:09:15,200
Peter.

995
01:09:15,267 --> 01:09:17,067
 Yeah?

996
01:09:17,133 --> 01:09:24,701
Everything that happened with us
happened for a reason.  This is
 who we are together.

997
01:09:24,767 --> 01:09:29,734
 We're just going to stay the
 same way it's not going to be
any different.

998
01:09:29,801 --> 01:09:38,300
Yeah I know.  I understand what
you're saying.

999
01:09:38,367 --> 01:09:44,734
   I understand you.
 This is what I want.

1000
01:09:44,801 --> 01:09:48,667
You are the person that I have
  to be with.

1001
01:09:48,734 --> 01:09:52,167
   Do you feel the same way?

1002
01:10:20,300 --> 01:10:21,934
  Where are my pants?

1003
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,167
  Oh no, I'll do it.  Sorry.

1004
01:10:24,234 --> 01:10:32,501
It's okay.  We should uh, see if
   Highheeled Shoes is still
   playing.

1005
01:10:32,567 --> 01:10:34,901
   Okay, that sounds great.

1006
01:10:34,968 --> 01:10:38,734
  I'm joking.

1007
01:10:38,801 --> 01:10:40,567
  Oh.

1008
01:10:40,634 --> 01:10:44,767
You don't remember saying that
you'd rather have your scrotum
  nailed to a chair.

1009
01:10:44,834 --> 01:10:48,901
You can see whatever movie you
  want, is my point.

1010
01:10:48,968 --> 01:10:50,801
  I'm aware of that.

1011
01:10:50,868 --> 01:10:56,033
  No I know you are I'm just
saying that whatever you're into
 that's fine with me.

1012
01:10:56,100 --> 01:11:01,000
 No I just remember you saying
that and I thought it was funny

1013
01:11:01,067 --> 01:11:05,000
  Right. Right. Yeah.

1014
01:11:10,067 --> 01:11:16,100
 Well there's like five movies
 playing at the big theater in
   about three hours

1015
01:11:16,167 --> 01:11:19,400
why don't we just go there then
 and pick on.

1016
01:11:19,467 --> 01:11:27,067
 Okay. Maybe we could go have
brunch like an hour before the
 movie starts.

1017
01:11:27,133 --> 01:11:28,634
You'll be hungry by then right?

1018
01:11:28,701 --> 01:11:30,634
 I'll be fine but you haven't
eaten.

1019
01:11:30,701 --> 01:11:32,434
Oh I'm fine I'm not that hungry.

1020
01:11:32,501 --> 01:11:35,567
Peter you're always hungry.  And
 you won't get your meal for a
 couple hours.

1021
01:11:35,634 --> 01:11:37,801
It's fine. I can wait. I'm fine.

1022
01:11:37,868 --> 01:11:39,033
  You don't have to.

1023
01:11:39,100 --> 01:11:40,934
 You just ate.
  I'm really not that hungry.

1024
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:42,934
Peter.

1025
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:44,267
 What?

1026
01:11:55,667 --> 01:12:03,033
  I'm trying too hard 

1027
01:12:03,100 --> 01:12:05,033
  It's okay.

1028
01:12:05,100 --> 01:12:10,267
 Okay.

1029
01:12:44,300 --> 01:12:47,501
Do you want me to make you some
scrambled eggs?

1030
01:12:47,567 --> 01:12:49,133
  No I'm not hungry.

1031
01:12:49,200 --> 01:13:05,300
 How bout a toasted pita with
cheese?
