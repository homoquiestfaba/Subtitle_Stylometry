Kate Berlant and John Early

As they tap-danced their way

behind the scenes was a story
of discord, deception,

the book was so, like, big.

127
00:05:21,196 --> 00:05:23,782
I kind of had this experience,
like, kind of being, like,

I was equally interested
in this dynamic,

like, on top of the book,

like...
[slams book]

135
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:36,252
But sometimes
there was such liberation,

136
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:39,130
such a pleasure and kind of
feeling myself being erased...

137
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:41,758
and kind of going...

138
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,387
[sighs] It was that push and
pull that I found so erotic,

139
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:48,973
obviously, but also...

140
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:50,100
playful.
- Mm.

141
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:52,977
- And I don't think
we marry eroticism

142
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:54,354
to play enough culturally

143
00:05:54,396 --> 00:05:57,607
because we're so focused on...

144
00:05:57,649 --> 00:05:59,609
a 9:00 to 5:00.

145
00:05:59,651 --> 00:06:01,194

if you didn't read the book.

146
00:06:01,236 --> 00:06:03,530
Like, honestly, it was bad.

147
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:05,532
Like, I wish I didn't read it.

148
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:07,951
It's fine if anyone
didn't read it, you know.

- Yeah.

154
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,212
- Um, I definitely read
the book.

155
00:06:19,254 --> 00:06:21,047
I made notes.

156
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:22,966
- It is kind of hurtful
if people didn't read the book,

157
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:25,427
'cause, like, if you take time
to read it

the book, but it's okay.

161
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:35,395

there's a burning--

169
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:57,125

170
00:06:57,167 --> 00:06:59,252

I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine.

00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:07,677
that's cause for concern.

176
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:09,095
- Casey, Casey, I'm fine.

177
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:11,056
I just think someone outside
maybe is making toast,

178
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:13,266
maybe a friendly neighbor, and
it's just wafting through the--

179
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:15,769
- Oh, my God. W-W--Oh, my God.
- Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

180
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,354
- Maybe we should call
an ambulance.

181
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:19,022
- John. Oh, my God, we can't
continue the discussion.

182
00:07:19,064 --> 00:07:20,398
Oh, my God. John.

183
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,941
- Does this happen
to him often?

184
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:23,485
- I finished the book.
- John. John.

185
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:24,778
- I finished the book.
- He finished it.

186
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:25,945
He really finished it.

187
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:27,822
- Babe, did you call 911?
- Yeah.

188
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:30,658
- Are you proud?
I finished "Clancy's Reward."

189
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,202
- You should definitely call
an ambulance.

190
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:34,329
I'm so sorry to have to end
the discussion early.

191
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:36,247
[whispering] Thank you.
- [whispering] You're welcome.

192
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:38,917
- We can't continue.
- We came prepared.

193
00:07:43,338 --> 00:07:45,465
<i>[upbeat music]</i>

194
00:07:45,507 --> 00:07:47,342
- Welcome back
to "Point of Vieira."

195
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:48,927
I'm Meredith Vieira.

196
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:50,929
Let's get back
to our exclusive interview

197
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,807
with Kate Berlant
and John Early.

198
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:57,102
How does it feel
to be sitting here together

199
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:58,937
after so many years?

200
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:00,230
- I needed this.

201
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:02,065
I think I'm actually now
really looking around--

202
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:03,775
- Cathartic.
- It's really cathartic.

203
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:06,194
- Yeah.
- I'm getting a little dizzy.

204
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:07,195
- Oh, jeez.
- Oh.

205
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:08,279
- I'm fine.
- Okay.

206
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:09,864
- I'm gonna move through it.
- Okay.

207
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:12,200
- But I'm getting
a little dizzy.

208
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:15,161
- For you, John, same feelings?
- [squeals] Uh...

209
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:17,080
- I'm sorry.
- I feel really good.

210
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:19,457
- We can't hear you, sweetie.
- I feel good.

211
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:22,043
- You look--I'm looking at you.

212
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:24,796
It's so strange 'cause you look
12, but you also look 60.

213
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:27,841
And I love the shading,

214
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:29,801
and you finally found
a foundation that matches.

215
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:31,136
- You know, it's so funny.

216
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:32,971
Obviously, I haven't seen you
in years.

217
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:34,848
- Yeah, I know, years, years.

218
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:36,641
- You know, I haven't seen you
in person,

219
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:39,352
Um...I haven't seen you
in person,

220
00:08:39,394 --> 00:08:41,980
but I also haven't seen you
just kind of reflected

221
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:43,815
anywhere in the culture,
so what have you been up to?

222
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:45,817
- I've been really good.
I've been busy.

223
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:47,402
I've been in New York
doing theater.

224
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:48,778
- Aw!

225
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,613
- It's just kind of
the first love of mine.

226
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:52,949
But, mostly, I'm busy
with my foundations.

227
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:54,451
That is really
what keeps me occupied.

228
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:55,660
- You have foundations?
- Yeah.

229
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:57,037
I've started many foundations.

230
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:58,705
And that's where I really pour
my energy now.

231
00:08:58,747 --> 00:09:00,248
- What foundations?
- My foundations.

232
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:01,458
- Which ones?

233
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:02,667
- A lot of work,
but it's so worth it.

234
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:03,835
Hmm?
- Which foundations?

235
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:06,504
- Which foundation?
- Name one.

236
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:07,881
- Which foundation
would I name?

237
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:09,591
Do you see?
- One of them, yeah.

238
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:10,717
- Which foundation, you know,

239
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:11,801
and if you come down
to the office--

240
00:09:11,843 --> 00:09:13,178
- It's almost Irish.
Which foundation?

241
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:14,846
- I didn't go Irish
at all with that.

242
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:16,556
I didn't go Irish
when I said foundation.

243
00:09:16,598 --> 00:09:18,767
- Now she's fully Irish, so...

244
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:20,226
- You, mister,

245
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:22,145
I can't go anywhere
without seeing your face.

246
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:23,438
- [laughs] I know.

247
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,315
- I saw you in the movie
where you play the genie.

248
00:09:25,357 --> 00:09:26,733
- Oh, yeah.

249
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:28,318
- I walked in on
my friend's dog watching it.

250
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,779
The dog was completely
fixated on you.

251
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,155
That must have
been hard, though.

252
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:34,449
I know you got a lot of flak
for playing the genie.

253
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:36,368
People are so vicious now.

254
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,787
- Oh, my God, I should've
congratulated you on the kiosk.

255
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:40,372
- What kiosk?
- Should've led with that.

256
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,082
Yes, congrats on the kiosk.

257
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:44,125
Um, Kate has been selling
candies...

258
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:45,877
- Oh, my gosh.
- At the airport.

259
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:48,046
This little kiosk at
the airport with your candies.

260
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:49,381
- No, I don't sell candy
at the airport.

261
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:52,092
- Pralines and nut clusters
and toffees...

262
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:53,968
- I don't sell pralines.
- And little whoopsie daisies.

263
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:55,303
Yeah.
- I don't sell candy

264
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:57,681
at the airport.
- It's just not what I heard.

265
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:59,724
- I don't think anyone's
ever told you I do that.

266
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:01,267
I can't believe
I'm saying that.

267
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:03,144
- Kate, I'm not attacking you.
It is just not what I heard.

268
00:10:03,186 --> 00:10:04,354
- Well, I don't have a kiosk
at the airport.

269
00:10:04,396 --> 00:10:05,772
- Mutual friends
have reported that you have

270
00:10:05,814 --> 00:10:07,691
a kiosk at the airport
where you sell candy.

271
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:09,067
- I do not sell candy
at the airport,

272
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:10,568
and no mutual friends
have reported that

273
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:11,903
'cause that would be a lie.

274
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:14,906
- Sorry, is it cold in here?
- I don't think so.

275
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:16,408
- Yeah, I just feel
a little cold.

281
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:28,920
- I feel good.
I feel really good.

282
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:30,422
- Didn't I tell you
the first month

283
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:32,007
is a little tough with nausea?

284
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:33,800
But then you just overcome that
hump, and it feels so good.

285
00:10:33,842 --> 00:10:35,301
- Yeah, my receptors
were completely gnarled.

286
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:37,178
- Yeah. Are you sleeping well?
- Like a rock.

287
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:39,097
- Right?
My head hits the pillow now--

288
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:40,765
I'm out immediately,
two minutes max.

289
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:42,767
- Yeah, buddy, I'm the same.

290
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:44,686
I'm the same thing.
- Yeah.

291
00:10:44,728 --> 00:10:46,104
No, you seem
to have really leveled out.

292
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:47,647
- Yeah. Yeah.
- It's really cool to see.

293
00:10:47,689 --> 00:10:49,065
Yeah, yeah,
I told you we're doing,

294
00:10:49,107 --> 00:10:50,483
like, a lot
of home-renovation stuff.

295
00:10:50,525 --> 00:10:51,860
- We're actually doing
some renovations, too.

296
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:53,278
- Oh, no way.

297
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:55,405
- Yeah, a buddy of mine's
helping me out with some...

298
00:10:55,447 --> 00:10:58,074
You know that wall between
the living room and the garage?

299
00:10:58,116 --> 00:10:59,909
- Yes.
- We had that knocked down.

300
00:10:59,951 --> 00:11:02,746
- Oh, so the garage is exposed
to the living room?

301
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:04,330
- Totally exposed.
- Oh, no way. No way.

302
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:06,833
You know that wall
that separates the bedroom

303
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:08,501
from the bathroom,
like, the main--

304
00:11:08,543 --> 00:11:10,211
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- We knocked that down.

305
00:11:10,253 --> 00:11:11,755
- Oh, amazing.
- Yeah, yeah.

306
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:13,590
- You know, my daughter's room
at the top of the upstairs?

307
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:14,841
- Oh, yeah, for sure.

308
00:11:14,883 --> 00:11:16,176
- There's that utility room
next to it

309
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:17,677
with the boiler,
hot water heater.

310
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:19,137
Yeah, we had
that wall knocked down.

311
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:20,430
- Okay.
- So now the boiler is kind of

312
00:11:20,472 --> 00:11:22,974
in the room with my daughter
as she sleeps.

313
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:24,809
- The renovation stuff is,
like, you have to.

314
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:26,311
Hi.
- I don't want to interrupt,

315
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:29,522
but a check for you.
- No interruption.

316
00:11:29,564 --> 00:11:31,775
No, absolutely not.
- No, no, no, let me get this.

317
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:33,485
- No.
- Do not listen to this guy.

318
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:35,070
Don't take his money.

319
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:37,238
- Oh, do you take hot caramel?
- Of course, yeah. Of course.

320
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,366
- Very cool. Thank you.
- He insisted.

321
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:41,409
- I surrender. [laughs]
- I insist.

322
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:44,162
She's gorgeous.
- Yeah, she's beautiful.

323
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:45,413
- Yeah, you know

324
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:47,624
that row of homes
right across from our place?

325
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:49,167
- Mm-hmm.

326
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:50,669
- Yeah, we went ahead, had
all those homes knocked down.

327
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,253
- Oh, wow.
- Yeah.

328
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:53,838
So when Kara's cooking
in the kitchen, she looks out,

329
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,006
and it's totally open.

330
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:56,966
- That's amazing.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

331
00:11:57,008 --> 00:11:59,094
- Well, I would love
to bring Sasha over there

332
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:00,720
and see how you guys
opened the space.

333
00:12:00,762 --> 00:12:02,597
And I know Sasha would love
to see Kara.

334
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,140
- Kara would love
to see Sasha.

335
00:12:04,182 --> 00:12:05,100
- Yeah.

336
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:11,940
[device beeps]

337
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:14,401
- This is, like, Mediterranean
food, technically.

338
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:18,196
Yeah, it's my trip.

339
00:12:33,628 --> 00:12:36,047
She was really nice.

340
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:40,260
Did you valet?
- Yeah.

341
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:41,553
- Yeah, same.

342
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:44,472
<i>[soft music]</i>

343
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:53,106
[indistinct chatter]

344
00:12:53,148 --> 00:12:55,900
- Oh, my God.
It's not gonna fit.

345
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:59,112
- Give me a second before you
make these bold declarations.

346
00:12:59,154 --> 00:13:00,488
- No time is gonna
make that fit.

347
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:02,323
- Had I put this
in the checked bag,

348
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:05,326
we would've gotten a fee,
an exorbitant fee.

349
00:13:05,368 --> 00:13:06,953
You know what?
I'm just gonna hang on to it,

350
00:13:06,995 --> 00:13:08,621
read on the plane--
it'll be fine.

351
00:13:08,663 --> 00:13:10,123
- You are not gonna read
that thing.

352
00:13:10,165 --> 00:13:11,583
- Yes, I am gonna read it.

353
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:14,044
- This line is not moving.
We are at standstill.

354
00:13:14,085 --> 00:13:15,253
- Oh, God.

355
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:17,881
- I just hope
I get on the plane.

356
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:19,966
They're boarding.
They're boarding.

357
00:13:20,008 --> 00:13:21,217
- Hey, hey, what's up, folks?

358
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:22,469
How would you like to breeze

359
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,220
through the security line
today, huh?

360
00:13:24,262 --> 00:13:25,430
- What is does that mean?

361
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:27,223
- My name is Frankie.
I'm with Breezer.

362
00:13:27,265 --> 00:13:29,351
- Breezer, what is that?
What is Breezer?

363
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:31,728
- It's a VIP experience
at the airport.

364
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:33,980
Could have you at your gate
within five minutes, huh?

365
00:13:34,022 --> 00:13:35,648
- F-five minutes?

366
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:37,650
- Ooh!
Damn, boy, you're strong, huh?

367
00:13:37,692 --> 00:13:39,569
[laughs]
Congratulations.

368
00:13:39,611 --> 00:13:41,613
- Ask how much. Ask how much.
- How much is it?

369
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,656
- You don't need to worry
about that.

370
00:13:43,698 --> 00:13:45,408
You won't even be charged
for the first month,

371
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:48,203
and you could cancel anytime.
- Well, that seems low risk.

372
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:49,412
- Yeah.
- That seems low risk.

373
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:51,289
- Sorry, are you
with the airport, again?

374
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:53,667
- He's with the airport.

375
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:55,585
- Let's go, Blake.
Off your phone, buddy.

376
00:13:55,627 --> 00:13:57,420
- Okay, okay.

377
00:13:57,462 --> 00:14:00,131
<i>- Hi, there, I'm Breezer.</i>
<i>Let's get started.</i>

378
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:02,676
- Just need a ID
and credit card.

379
00:14:02,717 --> 00:14:04,135
- Oh, okay.

380
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:06,388
- You have ours.

381
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:10,600
Do you have Blake's, too?
- Yeah. Here you are.

382
00:14:10,642 --> 00:14:12,560
- Now I just need you to look
at this red dot here.

383
00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:13,853
- Oh.
- Just look right in there?

384
00:14:13,895 --> 00:14:16,356
- Yeah, let's get you scanned.
[device beeps]

385
00:14:16,398 --> 00:14:18,441
- Oh, oh.
<i>- Following guest.</i>

386
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:19,609
- You okay?
- Yeah.

387
00:14:19,651 --> 00:14:23,196
No, I-I didn't like that.
- Right here?

388
00:14:23,238 --> 00:14:24,864
- You go.
<i>- Three, two, one.</i>

389
00:14:24,906 --> 00:14:26,408
[device beeps]
- Ow.

390
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:28,952
Oh, should it sting?
There's a stinging.

391
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:30,537
- Ah, it's in your mind.

392
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:32,372
- Oh, and you are not gonna
want to hear this,

393
00:14:32,414 --> 00:14:33,707
but if we go to Disneyland,

394
00:14:33,748 --> 00:14:35,125
we're stopping
to visit my sister.

395
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:36,835
- Oh, Anaheim.

396
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:39,170
- She just got through chemo.
I haven't even called her.

397
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:41,047
- [laughs] That's hilarious.

398
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:42,841
- [scoffs]
You're not listening.

399
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:46,052
- Congratulations, folks.
Welcome to the Breezer family.

400
00:14:46,094 --> 00:14:47,971
- Oh.
- Thank you so much, Frankie.

401
00:14:48,013 --> 00:14:49,264
- No problem, baby.

402
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:51,182
Just head over to that sign
that says Breezer

403
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:54,561
and breeze on through.
- Okay. Okay.

404
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:57,439
- It's just $240.
That's half off the first year.

405
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,982
If we want to buy back
a retina scan,

406
00:14:59,024 --> 00:15:00,358
it just takes 90 days,

407
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,818
and all we have to do
is appear in court.

408
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:05,655
- Oh, I'm sorry, $240?
- I'm hearing myself.

409
00:15:05,697 --> 00:15:07,741
- I feel violated.
- We've been scammed.

410
00:15:07,782 --> 00:15:10,201
- It's the naturalization
of these daily indignities.

411
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:11,536
Next thing you know,

412
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:13,663
your auto-enlisted
in the goddamn military.

413
00:15:13,705 --> 00:15:15,582
- I'm gonna go talk to him.
Blake, get off your phone.

414
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:17,375
- Oh, well, at least
we're gonna get through.

415
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:19,711
- I'm gonna confront him.
Frankie?

416
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:22,255
- David.
- Oh.

417
00:15:22,297 --> 00:15:25,258
[laughter]
- Hi, Phil. Hi, Chris.

418
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:28,303
- Dave and Ellen.
And oh, it's Blake.

419
00:15:28,345 --> 00:15:31,097
Kayla, it's Blake.
- Hi, Kayla. Hi, Katie.

420
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:33,433
- So this is crazy.
- I know.

421
00:15:33,475 --> 00:15:35,643
- Where are you guys going?
- Los Angeles.

422
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:37,687
- No, that's where we're going.
- [gasps] Stop.

423
00:15:37,729 --> 00:15:40,607
- For two weeks.
- We're going just for 10 days.

424
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:42,275
both: Yeah.
- That's amazing.

425
00:15:42,317 --> 00:15:44,569
Isn't that just,
like, serendipity?

426
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:46,613
- Yeah.
- Where are you staying?

427
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:48,448
- At this place that was
highly recommended...

428
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:50,492
- For ease, yeah.
- Yeah.

429
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:52,952
- Fun, fun, fun. So amazing.
- That's great.

430
00:15:52,994 --> 00:15:54,371
- How about you guys?

431
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:56,247
- We got a little place out
in Malibu.

432
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:57,874
- Oh, wow.

433
00:15:57,916 --> 00:15:59,668
- You know, we tried
to get off the beaten path.

434
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:02,629
- We're going on a hike
out by the Hollywood sign.

435
00:16:02,671 --> 00:16:04,464
- Yeah, see the Hollywood sign.

436
00:16:04,506 --> 00:16:06,007
- Always wanted
to get that shot.

437
00:16:06,049 --> 00:16:08,093
- I heard
you can't get up there.

438
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:10,011
You can't.
- There's no access.

439
00:16:10,053 --> 00:16:13,348
- No, there is, though.
- No, no, no. No, you can't.

440
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:14,974
You cannot hike
to the Hollywood sign.

441
00:16:15,016 --> 00:16:16,393
100% you cannot hike
to the Hollywood sign.

442
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:17,602
- No one can.

443
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:19,354
- Well, tell that
to our travel agent.

444
00:16:19,396 --> 00:16:20,480
- There's a whole thing--

445
00:16:20,522 --> 00:16:21,648
someone hung themselves
up there.

446
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:24,442
- Oh, God.
That's so horrible--suicide.

447
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:26,236
- Oh, no.
- Jesus.

448
00:16:26,277 --> 00:16:28,321
- Oh. Sorry.

449
00:16:28,363 --> 00:16:29,989
- Are you--
you're reading that book?

450
00:16:30,031 --> 00:16:31,449
That's a client of mine.

451
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:33,702
I know him.
- He's a client?

452
00:16:33,743 --> 00:16:35,620
- Yeah, he's fantastic.
- Paul Floor is a client?

453
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:37,205
- Crazy but fantastic.
- Wow.

454
00:16:37,247 --> 00:16:38,998
- Yeah.
No, I'm loving it so far.

455
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,584
I'm loving it so far.

456
00:16:41,626 --> 00:16:44,337
- And, Blake, how are you,
Mr. Man?

457
00:16:44,379 --> 00:16:46,006
- Fine.
- Oh, well, you--

458
00:16:46,047 --> 00:16:47,132
both: Oh.

459
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:48,883
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

460
00:16:48,925 --> 00:16:50,593
It's so good to see you.

461
00:16:50,635 --> 00:16:52,554
I have to say, we're a little
anxious to get to the plane,

462
00:16:52,595 --> 00:16:54,305
although we're part
of this new--

463
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:55,473
Do you know Breezer?

464
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:57,892
It's kind of
a concierge VIP service.

465
00:16:57,934 --> 00:16:59,978
It kind of gets you---
- Exclusive service.

466
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,771
- Yeah, you can bypass
the whole line and get there.

467
00:17:01,813 --> 00:17:03,857
- It's in the name--Breezer.
- It's not cheap.

468
00:17:03,898 --> 00:17:05,775
But it's worth
kind of the peace of mind.

469
00:17:05,817 --> 00:17:07,027
- We love it.

470
00:17:07,068 --> 00:17:08,862
- You've not read the article
about Breezer?

471
00:17:08,903 --> 00:17:10,989
- You didn't give them
your credit card, did you?

472
00:17:11,031 --> 00:17:12,615
- Y-yeah.
- Whoa.

473
00:17:12,657 --> 00:17:14,075
- Oh.

474
00:17:14,117 --> 00:17:16,327
Yeah, you're gonna probably
have your identity stolen.

475
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:18,121
- You're kidding.

476
00:17:18,163 --> 00:17:20,248
- No, no, no, you do not want
to get involved with them.

477
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:22,000
They're gonna take
all of your information.

478
00:17:22,042 --> 00:17:23,251
Did they do the eye scan?

479
00:17:23,293 --> 00:17:24,794
- Yeah.
- Yeah, it's out there.

480
00:17:24,836 --> 00:17:28,673
- You can buy back your retina,
oh, so don't worry.

481
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:30,633
- Folks, folks,
I can take anyone

482
00:17:30,675 --> 00:17:33,553
who's in first class
to our expedited line.

483
00:17:33,595 --> 00:17:35,180
- Oh, my God, it's us.
- Guilty.

484
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:36,389
- Anyone in first class.

485
00:17:36,431 --> 00:17:38,141
- It was so fun
running into you.

486
00:17:38,183 --> 00:17:39,476
I love your top.
It's so cute.

487
00:17:39,517 --> 00:17:41,561
- We'll see you on
the Walk of Fame, huh, buddy?

488
00:17:41,603 --> 00:17:43,271
- Okay, cool.
- Bye. Bye.

489
00:17:43,313 --> 00:17:45,523
- It is good to see you.
- You look amazing.

490
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:46,941
Have you been
doing something?

491
00:17:46,983 --> 00:17:49,069
- No, but you look great, too.
- Okay. Love you.

492
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,820
- Bye. Love you, too.

493
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:53,907
What was that?
- I know.

494
00:17:53,948 --> 00:17:55,867
- What the hell was that?
- It's a hustle.

495
00:17:55,909 --> 00:17:57,452
I do not like the way
he talks to you.

496
00:17:57,494 --> 00:17:58,995
I shut down, did you feel that?
- I did.

497
00:17:59,037 --> 00:18:01,706
- I really felt myself
powering down.

498
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:02,791
- You were gone.

499
00:18:02,832 --> 00:18:04,167
- I don't have
the energy anymore.

500
00:18:04,209 --> 00:18:05,877
Maybe three years ago,
you know, when the boys

501
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,629
were really small,
I had the energy.

502
00:18:07,671 --> 00:18:10,090
But now, I've grown past it

503
00:18:10,131 --> 00:18:12,676
and I can't do it anymore.

504
00:18:12,717 --> 00:18:16,554
- That'll be--Oh, oh, oh.
I see right through you.

505
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:18,306
- First class,
well, that'll be us.

506
00:18:18,348 --> 00:18:20,725
So crass.
- We know you're first class.

507
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:22,227
It's right there
in the clothes.

508
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:24,938
- I can see by the rose gold
on your iPhone case, bitch.

509
00:18:24,979 --> 00:18:26,314
- Thank you. By the way,

510
00:18:26,356 --> 00:18:29,025
the baggier the clothes,
the bigger bank account is--

511
00:18:29,067 --> 00:18:31,027
- Oh, we have to get you
a new one of those.

512
00:18:31,069 --> 00:18:33,571
- We have to find--
'cause this, it should stick.

513
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:34,948
- Mom, Dad, our flight.

514
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:37,033
- Yeah, yeah, yeah,
should we breeze on through?

515
00:18:37,075 --> 00:18:38,827
Let's go. Let's go.

516
00:18:38,868 --> 00:18:41,162
- I'm getting a new suitcase.
- Wipe the slate clean.

517
00:18:41,204 --> 00:18:43,039
Oh, you know what?

518
00:18:43,081 --> 00:18:45,417
This is above five ounces.
I've got to chug this.

519
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:50,422
- I'm having a residual sort of
dull pain from the retina scan.

520
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:52,841
[voice muffles]
It's a dull present pain.

522
00:18:55,969 --> 00:19:02,892
<i>* *</i>

523
00:19:06,855 --> 00:19:10,108
- You both are married?
both: Yes, yes.

524
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:12,694
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

525
00:19:12,736 --> 00:19:15,697
- Very happily so. Very happy.
- So happy. So happy.

526
00:19:15,739 --> 00:19:17,198
- How is Mark, by the way?
- Mark's so good.

527
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,491
He says hi.
He sends his love.

528
00:19:18,533 --> 00:19:19,826
- Well, send it
right back to him.

529
00:19:19,868 --> 00:19:21,745
- How's Keith?
- Keith is great.

530
00:19:21,786 --> 00:19:23,455
Keith is great.
We're great.

531
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:26,833
- He's been good?
- He has been good.

532
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:29,210
I've really lost track
of the breakthroughs.

533
00:19:29,252 --> 00:19:31,713
- Mark and I pull back a layer,
there's another layer.

534
00:19:31,755 --> 00:19:33,340
Pull back a curtain,
there's another curtain.

535
00:19:33,381 --> 00:19:35,842
It's constantly unfolding.
It's almost like an onion.

536
00:19:35,884 --> 00:19:37,302
I don't think anyone's
ever talked about that.

537
00:19:37,344 --> 00:19:39,512
The layers of an onion
and the way you peel it back

538
00:19:39,554 --> 00:19:40,847
and there are more layers.

539
00:19:40,889 --> 00:19:43,850
- We have a marriage
that just keeps evolving.

540
00:19:43,892 --> 00:19:45,685
- Mark and I don't separate.
We follow each other.

541
00:19:45,727 --> 00:19:46,895
We share one towel.

542
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:48,730
You know, we're really
committed

543
00:19:48,772 --> 00:19:50,732
to no barriers between us.
- That's disgusting.

544
00:19:50,774 --> 00:19:53,068
- We don't go anywhere
without the other person.

545
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:54,986
- The emotional breakthroughs,
the physical breakthroughs,

546
00:19:55,028 --> 00:19:57,739
if I can, if I can go there.
- Please go there.

547
00:19:57,781 --> 00:20:01,076
- No, physical sexual
chemistry--white hot.

548
00:20:01,117 --> 00:20:03,912
We just...
- We are like two teenagers,

549
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:06,706
just kind of skin against skin,
just kind of--

550
00:20:06,748 --> 00:20:10,377
- No, when skin hits skin...
- Yeah, yeah.

551
00:20:10,418 --> 00:20:13,296
- Over years, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

552
00:20:13,338 --> 00:20:15,465
No, I, uh...

553
00:20:15,507 --> 00:20:16,633
Yeah.

554
00:20:16,675 --> 00:20:18,343
- Mer, the sex is good.

555
00:20:18,385 --> 00:20:20,387
- I think maybe we'll get off
that topic. I think that--

556
00:20:20,428 --> 00:20:21,971
- Mark can work the middle.

557
00:20:22,013 --> 00:20:25,433
- We should really switch gears
once again.

558
00:20:25,475 --> 00:20:27,435
- [blubbers]
Shake that off.

559
00:20:27,477 --> 00:20:29,521
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.

560
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:31,022
- Let's talk
about something positive.

561
00:20:31,064 --> 00:20:33,274
You both are married, both
happily married and children--

562
00:20:33,316 --> 00:20:35,402
how many kids do you all have?
- I have a couple.

563
00:20:35,443 --> 00:20:36,736
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

564
00:20:36,778 --> 00:20:38,238
- I've got a four.
I know how many kids I have.

565
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:39,489
I have four, yeah.

566
00:20:39,531 --> 00:20:41,241
- Do you know the names
of your children?

567
00:20:41,282 --> 00:20:42,742
- Yeah.

568
00:20:42,784 --> 00:20:44,911
- Go, name them.
- Huh? Say?

569
00:20:44,953 --> 00:20:47,414
- Say the names of your kids.

570
00:20:47,455 --> 00:20:48,998
- I will.

571
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:51,501
Sasha.

572
00:20:51,543 --> 00:20:54,421
- Oh, that's beautiful.
- Marsha.

573
00:20:54,462 --> 00:20:56,172
- Two more, honey.

574
00:20:56,214 --> 00:20:57,590
- I'm almost there.

575
00:20:57,632 --> 00:21:01,011
- Manda.
- Last one.

576
00:21:01,052 --> 00:21:02,345
- Charlie.

577
00:21:02,387 --> 00:21:04,264
And they're all different
heights, which is so fun.

578
00:21:04,305 --> 00:21:05,473
- Really, still?

579
00:21:05,515 --> 00:21:06,933
- They're
all different heights.

580
00:21:06,975 --> 00:21:09,269
- Yeah. And which ones
were IVF? Which ones...

581
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:10,770
- How are your girls?

582
00:21:10,812 --> 00:21:12,689
I know that you board them
upstate and rarely see them.

583
00:21:12,731 --> 00:21:14,024
- They go to a school

584
00:21:14,065 --> 00:21:15,692
that's amazing,
and it's on a farm.

585
00:21:15,734 --> 00:21:18,111
And the kids really, you know,
work with produce.

586
00:21:18,153 --> 00:21:20,780
- It's for kids with extreme
behavioral issues--

587
00:21:20,822 --> 00:21:24,409
biting, snatching, stealing,

588
00:21:24,451 --> 00:21:26,786
pushing, scratching.

589
00:21:26,828 --> 00:21:29,205
You had those scratches.
I remember that.

590
00:21:29,247 --> 00:21:30,957
<i>- When we come back,</i>

591
00:21:30,999 --> 00:21:33,752
<i>I finally get to the bottom</i>
<i>of the ugly truth.</i>

592
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:36,880
<i>What ripped Kate Berland</i>
<i>and John Early apart?</i>

593
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,844
[upbeat music playing]
- Five, six, seven, eight.

594
00:21:42,886 --> 00:21:44,679
One, two, three, four,

595
00:21:44,721 --> 00:21:47,724
five, six, seven, eight.

596
00:21:47,766 --> 00:21:50,685
One, two, three, four,

597
00:21:50,727 --> 00:21:53,480
five, six, seven, eight.

598
00:21:53,521 --> 00:21:56,232
Very nice.
Next group.

599
00:21:56,274 --> 00:21:59,652
One, two, three, four,

600
00:21:59,694 --> 00:22:02,572
five, six, seven, eight.

601
00:22:02,614 --> 00:22:04,240
One, two--

602
00:22:04,282 --> 00:22:06,201
And hold.

603
00:22:06,242 --> 00:22:08,912
[music stops]

604
00:22:08,953 --> 00:22:10,872
- What's up?
- What?

605
00:22:10,914 --> 00:22:12,165
- I want to take this
from the top, guys.

606
00:22:12,207 --> 00:22:14,167
- Okay, cool. From the top.
- Okay.

607
00:22:14,209 --> 00:22:17,295
- No, no, no.
Your top, just your top.

608
00:22:17,337 --> 00:22:18,588
Okay.
- [scoffs]

609
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:22,258
- Five, six, seven, eight.

610
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:24,219
And stop.
- What?

611
00:22:25,929 --> 00:22:27,597
- Just say it. What?
- Yeah, we can take it.

612
00:22:27,639 --> 00:22:28,765
- Yeah.
- I'm just trying to think

613
00:22:28,807 --> 00:22:30,892
of terms that'll stick,
you know.

614
00:22:30,934 --> 00:22:31,935
both: Wow.
- Okay.

615
00:22:31,976 --> 00:22:33,770
- No, no, it's not bad.

616
00:22:33,812 --> 00:22:35,605
It's just not
what we rehearsed.

617
00:22:35,647 --> 00:22:37,107
- Got it. No, point taken.
- Yeah.

618
00:22:37,148 --> 00:22:39,067
- You're making
your point so clear.

619
00:22:39,109 --> 00:22:40,902
Good job. Good job for making
a point so clear.

620
00:22:40,944 --> 00:22:43,196
- Okay, let's concentrate
on the movement.

621
00:22:43,238 --> 00:22:45,198
- Yeah, I would love to focus
on the movement.

622
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,908
That's what I came here to do--
focus on the movement.

623
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:48,284
- Great.
- Here to dance.

624
00:22:48,326 --> 00:22:50,495
- Just distribute the weight
evenly on your feet.

625
00:22:50,537 --> 00:22:52,789
Very top.
One, two...

626
00:22:52,831 --> 00:22:54,582
- We know,
you know what I mean?

627
00:22:54,624 --> 00:22:57,002
- Okay, let's just take a beat,
because I don't think anything

628
00:22:57,043 --> 00:22:58,753
I say is gonna get through
right now.

629
00:22:58,795 --> 00:23:02,424
So, everyone,
water and snack break.

630
00:23:02,465 --> 00:23:04,259
- Okay, wait, wait, wait.

631
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:06,011
I don't want to take a water
and snack break.

632
00:23:06,052 --> 00:23:08,805
I want to work.
- Back in line. Back in line.

633
00:23:08,847 --> 00:23:11,307
- Honestly, I think
this is just a matter

634
00:23:11,349 --> 00:23:12,475
of not enough rehearsal.

635
00:23:12,517 --> 00:23:13,852
- Try to talk to me

636
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:16,187
in a way that actually
allows me to learn

637
00:23:16,229 --> 00:23:18,148
because I feel completely
dragged through the mud.

638
00:23:18,189 --> 00:23:20,275
I feel completely
alone up here.

639
00:23:20,316 --> 00:23:21,401
My hands are tied,

640
00:23:21,443 --> 00:23:22,986
and I can't dance
if my hands are tied.

641
00:23:23,028 --> 00:23:24,195
- This is not
what's going on here.

642
00:23:24,237 --> 00:23:25,905
- Then that's gaslighting!
- Yeah.

643
00:23:25,947 --> 00:23:27,907
- That's gaslighting, mama!
Okay?

644
00:23:27,949 --> 00:23:30,035
If you're denying our reality,

645
00:23:30,076 --> 00:23:31,661
if you're saying
that what's happening to us,

646
00:23:31,703 --> 00:23:33,204
our lived experience
isn't real,

647
00:23:33,246 --> 00:23:34,539
that's textbook gaslighting.
- It actually is.

648
00:23:34,581 --> 00:23:36,750
- Okay, because what I see,
my lived experience

649
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:38,501
is that Riley--Sorry, Riley,
but you're asleep at the wheel.

650
00:23:38,543 --> 00:23:39,878
- Asleep.
- Me?

651
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:41,171
- Yeah, Riley, you.
- Yeah.

652
00:23:41,212 --> 00:23:43,214
- Sloan has her hand up.
Sloan.

653
00:23:43,256 --> 00:23:44,924
- I think you guys
are really good,

654
00:23:44,966 --> 00:23:46,676
but you just get
in your head maybe.

655
00:23:46,718 --> 00:23:48,178
both: Sloan.

656
00:23:48,219 --> 00:23:50,180
- I'm just really glad
that your mom's at jury duty

657
00:23:50,221 --> 00:23:52,974
and isn't here
to see this today, bitch.

658
00:23:53,016 --> 00:23:54,517
- Maybe we should take a break.

659
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:57,520
- It might be good for us
to blow off some steam and--

660
00:23:57,562 --> 00:23:58,980
- Oh, pick me, pick me.

661
00:23:59,022 --> 00:24:01,316
Shut the fuck up, Cha Cha.

662
00:24:01,358 --> 00:24:03,693
- Girls...

663
00:24:03,735 --> 00:24:05,945
this is not
a big adjustment.

664
00:24:05,987 --> 00:24:08,740
And why am I hard on you?
Because you're good.

665
00:24:08,782 --> 00:24:10,367
Because you're good.

666
00:24:10,408 --> 00:24:12,577
You're better than this.
both: Yeah.

667
00:24:12,619 --> 00:24:14,037
- Okay?
- I know that we have it.

668
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:16,039
I think we're under, like,
a lot of stress.

669
00:24:16,081 --> 00:24:17,499
- Let's actually go now.
Let's actually go.

670
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:18,875
Let's go now.
- It's actually good to go now.

671
00:24:18,917 --> 00:24:20,835
I'm ready now.
- Yes, snap to two.

672
00:24:20,877 --> 00:24:24,005
- Snap to two.
- And one, two, three, four.

673
00:24:24,047 --> 00:24:25,423
- What the hell?
both: Whoa.

674
00:24:25,465 --> 00:24:27,300
- Oh, my God. What is that?
What is that?

675

one and that you will get two.

it's just a lot more expensive.

doing it.

846
00:31:44,404 --> 00:31:46,781
That's mine.

847
00:31:46,823 --> 00:31:50,035
That's mine.
You just did mine.

848
00:31:50,076 --> 00:31:51,578
And now we have it on record.

849
00:31:51,619 --> 00:31:53,204
So she's actually
crossed a boundary.

850
00:31:53,246 --> 00:31:54,497
You've crossed
a legal boundary.

851
00:31:54,539 --> 00:31:56,916

- You crossed a legal boundary.

880
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:25,672
Okay, I guess
I misread the situation.

talking about?

892
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:57,412

a little bit, blow off steam.

893

to blow off steam.

- Jesus Christ.

It's okay.

- [chuckles]

921
00:35:03,436 --> 00:35:06,189
- I know
your back's killing you.

922
00:35:06,231 --> 00:35:08,149
- My doctor says everything
starts with the foot

923
00:35:08,191 --> 00:35:10,193
and then radiates up
to the back, yeah.

924
00:35:19,494 --> 00:35:20,787
Here?
- Yeah, that's good.

925
00:35:20,829 --> 00:35:22,872
- Okay.
- Give me that foot.

- How so?

929
00:35:54,821 --> 00:35:56,823
- They carry us...

930
00:35:56,865 --> 00:35:59,534
our whole lives, every step,

931
00:35:59,576 --> 00:36:01,661
taking our weight,
feeling the earth.

932
00:36:01,703 --> 00:36:03,788
If I run my finger
along this ridge,

933
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:05,707
I can feel the calluses formed

934
00:36:05,749 --> 00:36:08,626
from years of tap dancing
for executives.

935
00:36:08,668 --> 00:36:10,253
And, you know, all I have to do

936
00:36:10,295 --> 00:36:13,465
is drag my finger
three inches to the right.

937
00:36:13,506 --> 00:36:16,801
- [gasps] Fuck.

938
00:36:18,345 --> 00:36:20,597
- That skin is so sensitive.

939
00:36:20,638 --> 00:36:22,349
You're so receptive
to my touch.

940
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:24,225
You feel it everywhere.

943
00:36:31,358 --> 00:36:33,485
be so sensitive?

944
00:36:33,526 --> 00:36:34,861
What would it take
for the thing

945
00:36:34,903 --> 00:36:38,698
that's carried weight
for so long...

946
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:41,201
to finally let itself
be carried?

947
00:36:48,875 --> 00:36:52,045
- Oh, my God!
- Whoa, whoa. Where'd you go?

948
00:36:52,087 --> 00:36:54,047
- Don't look at my feet.
Don't touch my feet.

949
00:36:54,089 --> 00:36:56,383
Don't look at my feet.
They're hideous.

950
00:36:56,424 --> 00:36:58,968
- No, not on my watch.

00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:01,888

about yourself like that, okay?

952
00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:03,515
You're beautiful,
every part of you.

953
00:37:03,556 --> 00:37:05,642

yourself the way I see you.

956
00:37:16,444 --> 00:37:17,904
- What do you see?

957
00:37:17,946 --> 00:37:20,490
- I see someone
who's been running

958
00:37:20,532 --> 00:37:22,492
for a really long time

959
00:37:22,534 --> 00:37:26,746
and is finally starting
to get a little tired.

960
00:37:26,788 --> 00:37:29,916
- I'm so tired.
- I know.

961

What are you scared of?

963

00:37:36,756 --> 00:37:38,758
Being seen, I guess.

965
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,094
- And if I saw you,
what would I see?

966
00:37:41,136 --> 00:37:43,513
- Someone who doesn't see
themselves.

967
00:37:43,555 --> 00:37:46,349
- What don't you see?
- Myself.

968
00:37:46,391 --> 00:37:48,893
- Why don't you see yourself?
- Because I'm scared.

969
00:37:48,935 --> 00:37:51,062
- Of what?
- Of being seen, I guess.

970
00:37:51,104 --> 00:37:52,981
- Okay, so we're looping.
- Yeah, yeah, totally.

971
00:37:53,023 --> 00:37:54,691
- So I'm just gonna break us
out of this.

972
00:37:54,733 --> 00:37:56,026
- Yeah.

00:37:56,067 --> 00:37:59,612

that you're enough.

- Sorry, so am I looking at you
or at myself because--

978
00:38:14,878 --> 00:38:17,422
- John, look in the mirror...
- Totally, totally.

<i>two-bedroom apartment--</i>

1021
00:41:19,729 --> 00:41:22,982
<i>the set of</i>
<i>"He's Gay, She's Half-Jewish."</i>

1022
00:41:23,024 --> 00:41:24,359
<i>Having not stepped foot</i>

1023
00:41:24,401 --> 00:41:26,736
<i>on the hallowed studio lot</i>
<i>in many years,</i>

1024
00:41:26,778 --> 00:41:29,155
<i>Kate Berland and John Early</i>
<i>warned me,</i>

1025
00:41:29,197 --> 00:41:32,575
<i>it was sure to be</i>
<i>an emotional afternoon.</i>

1026
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:35,745
- Kate, you're not
gonna believe this.

1027
00:41:35,787 --> 00:41:38,039
- Oh, my God.
- Still gets me.

1028
00:41:38,081 --> 00:41:39,833
[chuckles]
- Unbelievable.

1029
00:41:39,874 --> 00:41:42,585
Oh, my God.

1030
00:41:42,627 --> 00:41:44,379
- Kate, Kate, the couch.

1031
00:41:44,421 --> 00:41:46,881
- Bottoming?
Try bottomless...

1032
00:41:46,923 --> 00:41:48,216
mimosas that is.

1033
00:41:48,258 --> 00:41:49,718
There is no heartache

1034
00:41:49,759 --> 00:41:52,262
a boozy brunch with me tomorrow
can't remedy.

1035
00:41:52,303 --> 00:41:54,973
- Bloody Mary full of grace.

1036
00:41:55,015 --> 00:41:56,641
[both laughing]
- Oh, my God.

1037
00:41:56,683 --> 00:41:58,727
- You guys need to get this.
- So much happened here.

1038
00:41:58,768 --> 00:41:59,769
- This couch.

1039
00:41:59,811 --> 00:42:01,021
- I know I'm horny

1040
00:42:01,062 --> 00:42:04,441
because I just read this
as "bareback pecan."

1041
00:42:04,482 --> 00:42:06,109
- Do you remember
I tried to buy it?

1042
00:42:06,151 --> 00:42:07,694
- Yes, yes.
- They wouldn't give it to me.

1043
00:42:07,736 --> 00:42:10,071
And, actually, it was a bit
contentious with the producers.

1044
00:42:10,113 --> 00:42:11,865
So I said, "Well, I gave
my life to the show."

1045
00:42:11,906 --> 00:42:14,451
- [grunts]
- Oh, oh, John.

1046
00:42:14,492 --> 00:42:16,745
Oh, my God.
Sweetie, are you okay?

1047
00:42:16,786 --> 00:42:17,912
- What? From what?

1048
00:42:17,954 --> 00:42:20,749
- That looked
like a real tumble.

1049
00:42:20,790 --> 00:42:22,834
- Tumbled?

1050
00:42:22,876 --> 00:42:25,420
- Are you okay?
- From what?

1051
00:42:25,462 --> 00:42:27,756
- From the fall.

1052
00:42:27,797 --> 00:42:29,716
- I didn't fall.
[chuckles]

1053
00:42:31,426 --> 00:42:33,678
Honey, I'm homo.

1054
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:36,890
- Jake?
[sighs]

1055
00:42:36,931 --> 00:42:38,641
- I'm afraid to ask.

1056
00:42:38,683 --> 00:42:40,977
- I tried to decorate
my first Christmas tree,

1057
00:42:41,019 --> 00:42:43,229
and I guess my Jewish
half took over.

1058
00:42:45,065 --> 00:42:46,441
- You remember this spot.

1059
00:42:46,483 --> 00:42:49,486
John would always be--
I wonder if there's still...

1060
00:42:49,527 --> 00:42:53,073
Oh, this has to have
been there...

1061
00:42:53,114 --> 00:42:56,159
It's probably been there
for 15 years.

1062
00:42:56,201 --> 00:42:58,578
John always had his stash,
little bottles of gin,

1063
00:42:58,620 --> 00:42:59,788
hidden around the set.

1064
00:42:59,829 --> 00:43:01,623
Where else?
Now I'm on a--

1065
00:43:01,664 --> 00:43:03,291
Oh, I remember this.

1066
00:43:03,333 --> 00:43:05,960
This is one of my books here.

1067
00:43:06,002 --> 00:43:07,879
John, you're not gonna
believe this.

1068
00:43:07,921 --> 00:43:09,756
[laughs]

1069
00:43:09,798 --> 00:43:10,965
Still stashed all over the set.

1070
00:43:11,007 --> 00:43:12,509
I was actually impressed
by that.

1071
00:43:12,550 --> 00:43:14,886
I used to always say that he's
tanked, the ratings haven't.

1072
00:43:14,928 --> 00:43:17,055
No. No. Oh!
- They did it.

1073
00:43:17,097 --> 00:43:18,640
Um, come in here.

1074
00:43:18,682 --> 00:43:21,142
Yeah, we were one of
the first multicamera--

1075
00:43:21,184 --> 00:43:22,227
- First show.
- First show?

1076
00:43:22,268 --> 00:43:23,645
- First show, period.

1077
00:43:23,687 --> 00:43:25,480
- We were the first
television shows in--

1078
00:43:25,522 --> 00:43:27,315
We were the first.
- Yeah.

1079
00:43:27,357 --> 00:43:29,651
- We were the first
television show in history

1080
00:43:29,693 --> 00:43:33,071
to show someone, uh,
actively taking a shit.

1081
00:43:34,114 --> 00:43:36,241
- [grunts]

1082
00:43:40,495 --> 00:43:42,163
I happen to hold
two world records.

1083
00:43:42,205 --> 00:43:45,083
I was also simultaneously
the first gay man

1084
00:43:45,125 --> 00:43:49,504
<i>in television history</i>
<i>to be seen taking a shit.</i>

1085
00:43:49,546 --> 00:43:51,756
- Penny!

1086
00:43:51,798 --> 00:43:53,591
It happened again!

1087
00:43:56,553 --> 00:43:58,179
<i>- People come up to me,</i>
<i>and they go,</i>

1088
00:43:58,221 --> 00:43:59,514
"Thank you for being
a woman on screen."

1089
00:43:59,556 --> 00:44:01,099
- And there's
so much shame--sorry.

1090
00:44:01,141 --> 00:44:03,268
- 'Cause kids watch the show,
and they go, "That's a woman."

1091
00:44:03,309 --> 00:44:06,521
- There's so much shame
that we have culturally

1092
00:44:06,563 --> 00:44:08,606
around these bodily functions.

1093
00:44:08,648 --> 00:44:10,692
- And I was one of the first
Jews to break into Hollywood.

1094
00:44:10,734 --> 00:44:12,193
It's a responsibility.

1095
00:44:12,235 --> 00:44:14,112
- You know, is it not just
another function of the body?

1096
00:44:14,154 --> 00:44:16,364
- It can be a lot
of responsibility.

1097
00:44:16,406 --> 00:44:19,367
- Is it no different than pee?

1098
00:44:19,409 --> 00:44:21,286
- I'm so moved.
- [snapping fingers]

1099
00:44:21,327 --> 00:44:23,621
- I'm so moved.

1100
00:44:23,663 --> 00:44:25,790
- Is it no different
than talking?

1101
00:44:25,832 --> 00:44:28,668
No. It's an opening
and closing of an orifice.

1102
00:44:28,710 --> 00:44:30,670
It's the same as this.
- I love this painting.

1103
00:44:30,712 --> 00:44:32,172
- Hey, get--
you're gonna want to get...

1104
00:44:32,213 --> 00:44:33,548
- This is really--

1105
00:44:33,590 --> 00:44:36,301
- An answer to this,
because, oof, yeah, Grandma.

1106
00:44:36,343 --> 00:44:38,136
- I know, Grandma.

1107
00:44:38,178 --> 00:44:41,723
[sighs] Grandma,
I don't know what to do.

1108
00:44:41,765 --> 00:44:43,558
It's like
with each promotion I get,

1109
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:45,977
I become more
and more undatable.

1110
00:44:46,019 --> 00:44:47,812
Will I ever find someone?

1111
00:44:47,854 --> 00:44:50,357
- You're a catch.
There are many eligible men

1112
00:44:50,398 --> 00:44:53,234
in this city who will celebrate
your success with you.

1113
00:44:53,276 --> 00:44:55,695
You just have to be patient.

1114
00:44:55,737 --> 00:44:58,073
- Thanks, Grandma.
- [belches]

1115
00:44:58,114 --> 00:44:59,783
- Grandma!

1116
00:44:59,824 --> 00:45:03,411
- Sorry, they serve seltzer
on tap in hell.

1117
00:45:05,747 --> 00:45:07,582
- The actress
who played my grandma...

1118
00:45:07,624 --> 00:45:10,251
- Dominique Reich.
- Dominique.

1119
00:45:10,293 --> 00:45:12,504
- It was such a loss
to the show, of course,

1120
00:45:12,545 --> 00:45:15,215
but also to
the comedy community at large

1121
00:45:15,256 --> 00:45:17,342
when she passed away,
especially for me.

1122
00:45:17,384 --> 00:45:19,427
You know, I was lucky enough
to have fostered

1123
00:45:19,469 --> 00:45:21,346
a real connection
with her on set.

1124
00:45:21,388 --> 00:45:24,766
- Meanwhile, I actually
fostered her daughter.

1125
00:45:24,808 --> 00:45:26,101
- When?

1126
00:45:26,142 --> 00:45:28,144
- After she passed.

1127
00:45:28,186 --> 00:45:30,939
- She left a lot
of her assets with me.

1128
00:45:30,980 --> 00:45:33,233
Actually, I rent out
some of her properties

1129
00:45:33,274 --> 00:45:34,609
still to this day.

1130
00:45:34,651 --> 00:45:37,278
- I remember I had to rent out
a dance space

1131
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:39,114
just to work
through some of my grief

1132
00:45:39,155 --> 00:45:40,740
that wasn't verbal.

1133
00:45:40,782 --> 00:45:42,826
- Sorry, do you hear how just
with "fostered" and "rent out,"

1134
00:45:42,867 --> 00:45:44,452
you're literally
just kind of free-associating

1135
00:45:44,494 --> 00:45:46,121
off the language
that I'm using.

1136
00:45:46,162 --> 00:45:47,455
- I always loved these chairs.

you two are processing this

clearly run deep.

I'd tell you, Mer.

Call me when you figure it out.

- Uh, I think self-care, right?

1159
00:46:36,171 --> 00:46:39,257
I think self-care is the answer
to all global issues.

1160
00:46:39,299 --> 00:46:41,217
- Do you think there's any way
after today

1161
00:46:41,259 --> 00:46:43,303

say anything yet

1165
00:47:21,591 --> 00:47:22,884
while I was in the bathroom?

1166
00:47:22,926 --> 00:47:26,513

- Unbelievable.

1167
00:47:26,554 --> 00:47:28,014
- It's unbelievable.
- Just say something.

1168
00:47:28,056 --> 00:47:30,892
- Just say something.
- Just say you're a fan.

1169
00:47:30,934 --> 00:47:35,438
- Say it...so we can move on
and enjoy our meal.

1170
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:37,732
- By the way, she doesn't even
need to be a fan.

1171
00:47:37,774 --> 00:47:39,984
She just needs
to acknowledge the work.

1172

- Well said, well said.

1173
00:47:41,361 --> 00:47:44,030
- When we walk into a room,
there's a charge.

1174
00:47:44,072 --> 00:47:45,740
- That charge, if you don't
acknowledge the work,

1175
00:47:45,782 --> 00:47:47,784
it can't release,
it can't be defused,

1176
00:47:47,826 --> 00:47:50,245
and then you're forcing
all the other patrons

1177
00:47:50,286 --> 00:47:52,247
to sit kind of suspended
in the charge.

1178
00:47:52,288 --> 00:47:55,583
And I'll just say this,
and I'm going to say it once.

If you don't do
a verbal acknowledgement

1180

1181
00:48:00,088 --> 00:48:02,257

at the very least.

1182
00:48:02,298 --> 00:48:03,758

1183
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:05,802
something symbolic,
something small,

1184
00:48:05,844 --> 00:48:07,595
something small
from the kitchen.

1185
00:48:07,637 --> 00:48:09,431
- If you're not gonna
literally say it...

1186
00:48:09,472 --> 00:48:10,682
both: Say it with the kitchen.

00:48:10,724 --> 00:48:11,975
- Say it with the kitchen,

1188
00:48:12,017 --> 00:48:13,935
and then we know,
and then we can relax.

1189
00:48:13,977 --> 00:48:17,772
- The hostess was a sweetheart.
- The hostess knew.

1190
00:48:17,814 --> 00:48:19,357
- When we came in...
- She knew.

1191
00:48:19,399 --> 00:48:21,401
- Her knees almost buckled.
I sensed it.

1192
00:48:21,443 --> 00:48:22,777
- She was beside--

1193
00:48:22,819 --> 00:48:24,404
At least in the eyes,
she was beside herself.

1194
00:48:24,446 --> 00:48:26,031
- She was beside herself.

1195
00:48:26,072 --> 00:48:28,199
Yeah, she's so sweet.
Our waitress, though...

1196
00:48:28,241 --> 00:48:30,952
- Our waitress--
something's off.

1197
00:48:30,994 --> 00:48:33,955
- She's frozen.
- She's frozen. Poor girl.

1198
00:48:33,997 --> 00:48:35,874
- What is she afraid of?
- Something's wrong.

1199
00:48:35,915 --> 00:48:39,711
I think maybe socially she's
a little behind her peer group.

1200
00:48:39,753 --> 00:48:42,297
- No, no,
there's something at home,

1201
00:48:42,339 --> 00:48:44,174
something generational,

1202
00:48:44,215 --> 00:48:46,217
something very early.
- Stop. I think she's coming.

1203
00:48:46,259 --> 00:48:48,178
- Is she empty-handed?
- She has a round of drinks.

1204
00:48:48,219 --> 00:48:50,680
- She has a round? Okay,
I'm gonna turn ever so lightly.

1205
00:48:50,722 --> 00:48:53,391
She smiled, John,
so it's happening.

1206
00:48:53,433 --> 00:48:55,143
- There's a little smile
creeping on her face.

1207
00:48:55,185 --> 00:48:56,561
Here she comes.

1208
00:48:56,603 --> 00:48:58,646
- We can settle into the fact
that it's happening.

1209
00:48:58,688 --> 00:49:00,899
- It's happening.
She knows how it works.

1210
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:03,109
- [gasps]

1211
00:49:03,151 --> 00:49:05,403
Oh.

1212
00:49:06,613 --> 00:49:09,657
- [scoffs] Unbelievable.

1213
00:49:09,699 --> 00:49:11,785
That's our round.
- That's our round.

1214
00:49:11,826 --> 00:49:14,496
Unbelievable.
- [sighs]

1215
00:49:14,537 --> 00:49:16,081
- Unbelievable.

1216
00:49:16,122 --> 00:49:18,291
- I haven't wanted to say this,
but she's charmless.

1217
00:49:18,333 --> 00:49:20,502
- She's charmless.
- The distaste.

1218
00:49:20,543 --> 00:49:23,004
The poor taste in that, John.
- The gall.

1219
00:49:23,046 --> 00:49:25,840
- To not have the gall,
the sense of self enough

1220
00:49:25,882 --> 00:49:28,968
to buck up, smile,
and, "I'm a fan."

1221
00:49:29,010 --> 00:49:30,845
- I'd like to have
a word with her.

1222
00:49:30,887 --> 00:49:33,139
- I'd like to follow her home,
give her a little scare.

1223
00:49:33,181 --> 00:49:34,891
- Give her a little scare.
- Knock on her door.

1224
00:49:34,933 --> 00:49:37,143
Finally she opens it.
Then the look on her face--

1225
00:49:37,185 --> 00:49:40,772
I can go, "Ah, so now
you acknowledge the work?"

1226
00:49:40,814 --> 00:49:42,816
- She's coming. She's fucking
coming to the table.

1227
00:49:42,857 --> 00:49:44,693
- Is she?
Well, you'll notice...

1228
00:49:44,734 --> 00:49:47,654
- Yeah, no round.
- [scoffs]

1229
00:49:47,696 --> 00:49:50,532
- Right here with your check.
No rush, of course.

1230
00:49:50,573 --> 00:49:53,576
- Why do I feel rushed?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

1231
00:49:53,618 --> 00:49:56,746
I just have to say,
I'm a huge fan.

1232
00:49:56,788 --> 00:49:59,499
I-I grew up on
"He's Gay, She's Half-Jewish,"

1233
00:49:59,541 --> 00:50:02,043
and to have you two
together like this,

1234
00:50:02,085 --> 00:50:03,878
it really brings me joy.

1235
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:06,881
So the banana split's
on me tonight.

1236
00:50:06,923 --> 00:50:09,759
- Oh, thanks, doll.
- Thank you, doll.

1237
00:50:09,801 --> 00:50:11,511
[chuckles]
- Huh. Okay.

1238
00:50:11,553 --> 00:50:12,929
- Now, that's class.

1239
00:50:12,971 --> 00:50:15,056
- And did you see
the color in her cheeks?

1240
00:50:15,098 --> 00:50:16,182
- Mm-hmm, that's grace.

1241
00:50:16,224 --> 00:50:18,268
- I'll just say it once.
Was that so hard?

1242
00:50:18,309 --> 00:50:19,477
- Was that so hard?

1243
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:22,564
No. What an angel
and such poise.

1244
00:50:22,605 --> 00:50:24,441
- Such a way of her,
such a zest.

1245
00:50:24,482 --> 00:50:26,401
- Yes. Yeah, of course.
- Real something.

1246
00:50:26,443 --> 00:50:29,237
- You know, I would love to
know her story, pick her brain.

1247
00:50:29,279 --> 00:50:31,656
Actually, we should get her
back here--where is she?

1248
00:50:31,698 --> 00:50:33,950
- We'll get her name
when we leave.

1249
00:50:33,992 --> 00:50:36,369
- I just want to leave--
- I'll ask them maître d'.

1250
00:50:36,411 --> 00:50:38,663
- [muttering to self]

1251
00:50:38,705 --> 00:50:41,833
- You know, they still make
my favorite wedge...

1252
00:50:41,875 --> 00:50:44,419
- It's an impeccable
wedge salad.

1253
00:50:44,461 --> 00:50:46,087
Oh, dear. Oh.

1254
00:50:46,129 --> 00:50:48,590
Here we go.

1255
00:50:48,631 --> 00:50:50,342
- [sniffs] How long was I out?

1256
00:50:50,383 --> 00:50:51,384
Kate?
- No time.

1257
00:50:51,426 --> 00:50:52,635
- Kate?
- No one saw.

1258
00:50:52,677 --> 00:50:54,346
- Kate, where are you?
- Right here, darling.

1259
00:50:54,387 --> 00:50:55,764
- Where are you?
- Right here, doll.

1260
00:50:55,805 --> 00:50:57,140
Dollface, right here.
- Oh, there you are.

1261
00:50:57,182 --> 00:50:59,642
- No one saw.
- You absolutely sure?

1262
00:50:59,684 --> 00:51:01,770
- Absolutely sure.
- All right. [clears throat]

1263
00:51:01,811 --> 00:51:05,106
- Do I have anything
in my teeth?

1264
00:51:05,148 --> 00:51:06,232
- No.

1265
00:51:06,274 --> 00:51:08,193
Do I?

1266
00:51:08,234 --> 00:51:09,527
- All clear.

1267
00:51:09,569 --> 00:51:10,987
- All right.

1268
00:51:11,029 --> 00:51:14,657
Mm, mine's ready.
- Mine too.

1269
00:51:16,159 --> 00:51:20,038
both: One, two,
together on three, and three.

1270
00:51:22,332 --> 00:51:23,333
- All right.

1271
00:51:23,375 --> 00:51:26,294
<i>[light music]</i>

1272
00:51:26,336 --> 00:51:29,381
<i>* *</i>

1273
00:51:29,422 --> 00:51:32,801
- [grunting]

1274
00:51:32,842 --> 00:51:34,761
[John mumbling, Kate humming]

1275
00:51:34,803 --> 00:51:36,721
- Oops, missed a sleeve.

1276
00:51:36,763 --> 00:51:41,434
<i>* *</i>

1277
00:51:41,476 --> 00:51:44,688
Bye.
[laughs]

1278
00:51:44,729 --> 00:51:47,148
Yeah, it's us.

1279
00:51:47,190 --> 00:51:49,442
- A sidecar and a martini--
love it.

1280
00:51:49,484 --> 00:51:51,319
- Oh.
[laughs]

1281
00:51:51,361 --> 00:51:53,446
Uh...
- Yeah.

1282
00:51:53,488 --> 00:51:55,573
- Hello, hello, hello.

1283
00:51:55,615 --> 00:51:57,492
How are you?

1284
00:51:57,534 --> 00:52:00,328
- Enjoy.
[John speaking indistinctly]

1285
00:52:00,370 --> 00:52:01,830
Why don't I take
a lap over there?

1286
00:52:01,871 --> 00:52:03,373
'Cause you already
got that side.

1287
00:52:03,415 --> 00:52:06,001
- Oh, I didn't get that far.
Yes, it's us, it's us.

1288
00:52:06,042 --> 00:52:08,003
- You can say something.
Don't be shy.

1289
00:52:08,044 --> 00:52:10,672
We don't bite.
[chuckles]

1290
00:52:10,714 --> 00:52:13,091
- Oh, they're
in our usual booth.

1291
00:52:13,133 --> 00:52:15,343
Your meal's on us.
I'm kidding.

1292
00:52:15,385 --> 00:52:18,513
[both laughing]

1293
00:52:18,555 --> 00:52:20,932
Oh, very nice, a prime rib.

1294
00:52:22,851 --> 00:52:26,229
- Now, where--I'm lost.
I'm lost.
