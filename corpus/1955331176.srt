934
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:46,224
you're both gonna be crowned the
ultimate baby loser.

boing!

947
00:19:06,412 --> 00:19:07,795

00:19:07,796 --> 00:19:09,179
boing!

949
00:19:09,182 --> 00:19:10,565

boing!

979
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:35,139
It's the only way we can make it
out of here

boing!

981
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:37,008

boing!

983
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:38,559

boing!

985
00:19:39,445 --> 00:19:40,945

boing!

997
00:19:52,058 --> 00:19:53,691
Do that 30 more times and you'll
get yourself a yellow card.

998
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:55,325
boing!

999
00:19:55,328 --> 00:19:56,594
4 of those and you're outta
here.

1000
00:19:56,595 --> 00:19:57,861
boing!

1001
00:19:57,864 --> 00:19:59,581

Ugh, we gotta amp it up.

boing!

1013
00:20:08,975 --> 00:20:10,825
You're seven verbal warnings

1041
00:20:40,373 --> 00:20:42,073
- Mm-hmm, interesting strategy.

1042
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:43,774
boing!

1043
00:20:43,776 --> 00:20:45,059
- Guys,
you're running out of time.

1044
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:46,343
boing!

1045
00:20:46,346 --> 00:20:47,045
Hurry up and get disqualified.

boing!

1047
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:49,530

all: Ahh! Oof! Hey! Oof! Hey!
Augh!

1070

I can't believe you killed my--
huh?

1089
00:21:44,937 --> 00:21:47,204

I can't believe you killed my--
huh?

1093
00:21:52,045 --> 00:21:53,361
