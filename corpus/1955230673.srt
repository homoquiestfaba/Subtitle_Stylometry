1
00:00:58,726 --> 00:01:00,361
[Screaming]

2
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:02,363
911.

3
00:01:02,396 --> 00:01:04,132
Yes!

4
00:01:04,165 --> 00:01:06,167
It's...
It took my little brother.

5
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,501
What happened?

6
00:01:07,535 --> 00:01:09,437
It took my little brother!

7
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:12,506
I-I can't understand
what you're saying.

8
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:14,542
What's wrong?

9
00:01:14,575 --> 00:01:17,211
What's wrong?

10
00:01:17,245 --> 00:01:19,513
My little brother.

11
00:01:19,547 --> 00:01:21,515
They took your little brother?

12
00:01:21,549 --> 00:01:24,218
Son, let me talk
to somebody else.

13
00:01:24,252 --> 00:01:26,887
I can't understand
what you're saying.

14
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,589
[Speaks indistinctly]

15
00:01:28,622 --> 00:01:30,158
How old is your brother?

16
00:01:30,191 --> 00:01:32,326
5.

17
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,662
- 5 years old?
- Yes.

18
00:01:34,695 --> 00:01:37,198
Somebody kidnapped
your 5-year-old brother?

19
00:01:37,231 --> 00:01:38,666
Yes!

20
00:01:38,699 --> 00:01:40,868
Please help him.

21
00:01:49,777 --> 00:01:51,812
With no sign of the little boy,

22
00:01:51,845 --> 00:01:53,581
There are some new worries
tonight.

23
00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:57,218
Will he be able to survive
a full night alone out there?

24
00:01:57,251 --> 00:01:58,819
When was the last time
you saw Dean?

25
00:01:58,852 --> 00:02:01,822
Um... They were just playing.

26
00:02:04,392 --> 00:02:05,693
He just vanished.

27
00:02:05,726 --> 00:02:08,562
He's just gone.

28
00:02:08,596 --> 00:02:12,166
Every 40 seconds, a child goes
missing in this country.

29
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,669
One of our kids
has gone missing,

30
00:02:15,703 --> 00:02:18,506
And nobody's doing anything.

31
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:20,908
Many people out there may have,
you know,

32
00:02:20,941 --> 00:02:23,544
Considered these children
as probably dead.

33
00:02:23,577 --> 00:02:26,714
Dean Tanner ain't no different
than anyone we've already lost.

34
00:02:26,747 --> 00:02:28,749
27 years, we've been asking,

35
00:02:28,782 --> 00:02:30,818
"Who could take
a 6-year-old boy?"

36
00:02:30,851 --> 00:02:33,287
Human beings
are violent animals.

37
00:02:33,321 --> 00:02:34,555
Yeah, they just are.

38
00:02:34,588 --> 00:02:36,424
They really hurt each other.

39
00:02:36,457 --> 00:02:39,527
They remember finding threads
of his clothes here and there

40
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:43,531
And half of his shoe,
part of his pants.

41
00:02:43,564 --> 00:02:44,798
It was kind of strange.

42
00:02:44,832 --> 00:02:46,667
I don't know
what happened there.

43
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:51,772
Yeah, this is a very...
A very violent fucking place.

44
00:02:51,805 --> 00:02:54,308
We know that time is the enemy,

45
00:02:54,342 --> 00:02:57,578
And we know that you have to
move quickly.

46
00:02:57,611 --> 00:03:02,283
But just because a child hasn't
been recovered in a week

47
00:03:02,316 --> 00:03:04,585
Or a month or a year or 15 years

48
00:03:04,618 --> 00:03:07,388
Does not mean
that it's acceptable

49
00:03:07,421 --> 00:03:09,457
To assume the worst
and stop looking.

50
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:12,493
Well, the cops we got
in this town

51
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:14,662
Aren't worth a shit anyway.

52
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:16,497
I'm here to tell you.

53
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:17,865
They're not gonna do anything!

54
00:03:17,898 --> 00:03:19,700
We're not trying
to put on a show.

55
00:03:19,733 --> 00:03:21,835
We're just trying to help people
find people.

56
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:23,571
Well, then take your camera

57
00:03:23,604 --> 00:03:26,574
And go into the fucking woods
and fucking find him.

58
00:03:26,607 --> 00:03:30,244
You're looking for answers
to why there's people missing.

59
00:03:30,278 --> 00:03:31,812
We already know about that.

60
00:03:31,845 --> 00:03:33,447
We're handling it.

61
00:03:33,481 --> 00:03:35,916
We don't need you flatlanders
to come in here

62
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:38,919
And start snooping around,
turning over stones.

63
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:41,589
You're opening up
a pandora's box

64
00:03:41,622 --> 00:03:43,524
Of hellacious shit
that you don't want to see.

65
00:03:51,532 --> 00:03:52,800
[Bang]

66
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:55,603
[Breathing heavily]

67
00:03:57,305 --> 00:03:58,739
Mike? Mike?

68
00:03:58,772 --> 00:04:01,609
Breathe, breathe, breathe.

69
00:04:01,642 --> 00:04:02,943
I'm right here.

70
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:04,745
I'm right here.

71
00:04:04,778 --> 00:04:07,014
It's over. Breathe.

72
00:04:07,047 --> 00:04:09,483
[Breathing deeply]

73
00:04:09,517 --> 00:04:11,485
It's over.

74
00:04:13,854 --> 00:04:16,256
It's okay.
This is why we're doing this.

75
00:04:24,365 --> 00:04:25,966
Oh, my God.

76
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:27,535
Guys, what is that?

77
00:04:27,568 --> 00:04:29,370
Wow!

78
00:04:29,403 --> 00:04:30,638
What is that?

79
00:04:30,671 --> 00:04:32,039
What's going on?

80
00:04:32,072 --> 00:04:35,509
No, I'm being really s...
What is that thing?

81
00:04:35,543 --> 00:04:37,044
What?
That's not what we're taking?

82
00:04:37,077 --> 00:04:38,912
[Exhales deeply]

83
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:42,049
That is, uh,
that's something else.

84
00:04:42,082 --> 00:04:43,917
- Josh, what is this?
- What?

85
00:04:43,951 --> 00:04:45,519
It's Bernadette.

86
00:04:45,553 --> 00:04:47,054
- Hey.
- Hey now.

87
00:04:47,087 --> 00:04:48,956
Seriously, what is this thing?

88
00:04:48,989 --> 00:04:50,758
It's a recreational vehicle.

89
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:52,059
Does this even drive?

90
00:04:52,092 --> 00:04:53,561
It moves.

91
00:04:53,594 --> 00:04:56,730
Oh. Oh!

92
00:04:56,764 --> 00:04:58,899
Wow.

93
00:04:58,932 --> 00:05:02,002
What is that smell?

94
00:05:02,035 --> 00:05:04,372
Pretty sure
it's called asbestos.

95
00:05:04,405 --> 00:05:07,675
Oh, my God.

96
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:09,410
Josh, this thing's nicer
than your apartment, man.

97
00:05:09,443 --> 00:05:11,612
- Come on.
- Are you kidding me right now?

98
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:14,348
Immediately I think
of a registered sex offender.

99
00:05:14,382 --> 00:05:15,583
It's a little awkward.

100
00:05:15,616 --> 00:05:16,850
Listen, things work.

101
00:05:16,884 --> 00:05:18,085
Oh, I don't even think
it's registered.

102
00:05:18,118 --> 00:05:19,687
[Laughter]

103
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,622
Do I need a flu shot
to get on this thing?

104
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:23,791
Yeah, you do.
Look, I got beds in the back...

105
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:26,026
Actually, I got one mattress
in the back for you,

106
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:27,528
So you have to deal with that.

107
00:05:27,561 --> 00:05:29,463
And then Teddy and I
will sit up front.

108
00:05:29,497 --> 00:05:30,931
We'll be fine.

109
00:05:30,964 --> 00:05:32,533
Teddy can do that.
I'll do across the chair here.

110
00:05:32,566 --> 00:05:34,502
We got some cameras.

111
00:05:34,535 --> 00:05:36,036
What?

112
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:38,906
Yeah, dad's... this is dad's
hunting vehicle, as well.

113
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:40,541
What?

114
00:05:40,574 --> 00:05:42,075
That... those work?

115
00:05:42,109 --> 00:05:44,044
- This thing's a piece of shit.
- I could get behind this.

116
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:46,647
Literally, 'cause we're gonna
have to push it, probably.

117
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,081
Oh, my God.

118
00:05:48,115 --> 00:05:50,384
[Engine turns over]

119
00:05:50,418 --> 00:05:51,852
- Josh?
- What?

120
00:05:51,885 --> 00:05:54,087
This, uh, this isn't really
a bathroom.

121
00:05:54,121 --> 00:05:55,656
No, it doesn't work, man.

122
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:57,925
Babe, if you ever want
to have sex again,

123
00:05:57,958 --> 00:05:59,927
You will get out
of that bathroom.

124
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,829
- I'm gonna hold it.
- No, nothing works.

125
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:04,665
- I'm gonna hold it.
- That was a smart decision.

126
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:07,000
Why are there so many cameras
in this thing?

127
00:06:07,034 --> 00:06:08,669
What were they doing in here?

128
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:10,137
I-I-i shudder to think.
We have four cameras.

129
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:11,805
We have two on the outside,
two on the inside.

130
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:13,607
I hate to think
of the amount of ass...

131
00:06:13,641 --> 00:06:16,043
Amount of women that were filmed
in here without their knowledge.

132
00:06:16,076 --> 00:06:17,778
That's making me feel
really safe,

133
00:06:17,811 --> 00:06:19,680
And especially in the middle
of nowhere

134
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:22,149
With no cellphone service,
feeling really good about this.

135
00:06:22,182 --> 00:06:23,617
I know this was my idea.

136
00:06:23,651 --> 00:06:24,952
I know.

137
00:06:24,985 --> 00:06:26,487
But...

138
00:06:28,822 --> 00:06:31,625
Is this like a two-Lane road
we got going on here,

139
00:06:31,659 --> 00:06:32,926
Or is this a one-bagger?

140
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,495
Stay right in the middle.

141
00:06:34,528 --> 00:06:35,796
Really? Okay.

142
00:06:35,829 --> 00:06:37,531
Maybe you shouldn't be
such a pussy.

143
00:06:37,565 --> 00:06:38,766
See, it's not pulling over yet.

144
00:06:38,799 --> 00:06:40,100
Now you back it up,
motherfucker.

145
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:41,635
That's right.

146
00:06:41,669 --> 00:06:43,437
Bernadette!

147
00:06:43,471 --> 00:06:44,838
Bernadette!

148
00:06:44,872 --> 00:06:46,740
- Check that out.
- Back that ass up.

149
00:06:46,774 --> 00:06:48,576
That's right.
Get out of my road.

150
00:06:48,609 --> 00:06:50,578
- There we go.
- Thank you, ma'am.

151
00:06:50,611 --> 00:06:52,646
- Thank you, kind sir.
- Is that a guy or a girl?

152
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,914
Thank you.

153
00:06:53,947 --> 00:06:56,450
Wow.

154
00:06:56,484 --> 00:06:59,186
I love that smell, though.

155
00:06:59,219 --> 00:07:01,889
I'm glad we decided
to do this trip in the fall.

156
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:03,624
This is so pretty.

157
00:07:03,657 --> 00:07:07,194
We are in the middle
of fucking nowhere.

158
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:12,199
[Laughter]

159
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:16,937
[Window squeaking]

160
00:07:18,972 --> 00:07:21,509
Teddy, do something funny.

161
00:07:21,542 --> 00:07:22,876
Full service!

162
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:25,913
[Laughter]

163
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:27,848
[British accent] Here we are,
in his natural environment.

164
00:07:27,881 --> 00:07:29,550
[Laughs]

165
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:33,821
Dangerous, dangerous predator,
a Joshua-cataranu.

166
00:07:33,854 --> 00:07:35,155
Fierce.

167
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:37,858
Looks like your average,
garden-variety Italian.

168
00:07:37,891 --> 00:07:39,493
[Laughs]

169
00:07:39,527 --> 00:07:42,530
But this gas station's
a variable greeding...

170
00:07:42,563 --> 00:07:44,164
Breeding ground for joshes.

171
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:46,634
There he is zipping up.
[Laughs]

172
00:07:46,667 --> 00:07:48,168
Pants still down,
indicative of his species.

173
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:50,504
Alpha male. Here he is.

174
00:07:50,538 --> 00:07:51,972
Oh, quick! Quick! Look!

175
00:07:52,005 --> 00:07:54,107
He's coming closer!
Easy girl.

176
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:55,609
Oh, she's a beaut!

177
00:08:01,114 --> 00:08:02,583
Drive.

178
00:08:02,616 --> 00:08:03,984
Oh, fuck you!

179
00:08:04,017 --> 00:08:05,586
- [Chuckles]
- God damn it!

180
00:08:05,619 --> 00:08:06,987
- Come on, Teddy.
- Come on, Ted.

181
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,188
Stop the goddamn...

182
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:09,657
I lost paper towels!

183
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:10,924
[Laughter]

184
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:12,292
Has he got beer?

185
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:14,294
Do you have the beer?
That's all we want.

186
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:16,263
Loaded, bro.
What are you doing?

187
00:08:16,296 --> 00:08:17,765
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

188
00:08:17,798 --> 00:08:19,066
Holy shit.

189
00:08:19,099 --> 00:08:20,834
All right, guys,
you didn't say anything

190
00:08:20,868 --> 00:08:22,202
About a gun in this thing.

191
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:23,937
Be careful with that, you guys.

192
00:08:23,971 --> 00:08:26,874
That's the best place for it...
Just under my balls.

193
00:08:26,907 --> 00:08:28,542
[Laughter]

194
00:08:28,576 --> 00:08:30,944
- Are we rolling?
- Picture's up. We are rolling.

195
00:08:30,978 --> 00:08:32,880
We rolling. All right.

196
00:08:32,913 --> 00:08:34,615
Okay, Michael.

197
00:08:34,648 --> 00:08:36,617
No time like the present.

198
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:38,151
We're gonna get you to open up.

199
00:08:38,185 --> 00:08:39,687
I'll be gentle.

200
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,889
- I will do my best.
- Okay. Okay.

201
00:08:41,922 --> 00:08:45,092
We are shooting a documentary,

202
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:49,162
Directed by lovely girlfriend,
Anne,

203
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:53,166
About me coming back
to happy camp.

204
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,903
Mm-hmm. How long has it been?

205
00:08:55,936 --> 00:08:58,205
Not to age yourself because I
know you're getting up there.

206
00:08:58,238 --> 00:08:59,707
20 years.

207
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,241
The gray hair
says that already.

208
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:03,577
The gray hair is coming through
quite nicely.

209
00:09:03,611 --> 00:09:05,713
It's been 20 years
since I've been back here.

210
00:09:05,746 --> 00:09:08,048
I guess my biological mother
put me up for adoption.

211
00:09:08,081 --> 00:09:09,617
I never knew my parents,

212
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:11,919
And I lived
with a few foster families

213
00:09:11,952 --> 00:09:15,122
Until I was adopted
at the age of 9.

214
00:09:15,155 --> 00:09:19,092
The tanners, Walt and Sandy,
were my parents for two years.

215
00:09:19,126 --> 00:09:21,662
They picked me up
at the airport,

216
00:09:21,695 --> 00:09:25,733
And that's how I came here.

217
00:09:25,766 --> 00:09:27,701
I remember getting off the plane

218
00:09:27,735 --> 00:09:30,938
And having, like, an airport
security person, I guess,

219
00:09:30,971 --> 00:09:36,644
Escort me out, and Dean,
who became my brother,

220
00:09:36,677 --> 00:09:37,911
And Walt and Sandy...

221
00:09:37,945 --> 00:09:39,780
Like I said,
they were my parents...

222
00:09:39,813 --> 00:09:42,215
They were waiting, and Dean had
a sign that said "Michael."

223
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:43,751
Aww.

224
00:09:43,784 --> 00:09:45,786
Tell me about Walt and Sandy.

225
00:09:45,819 --> 00:09:47,354
They were quiet. Nice.

226
00:09:47,387 --> 00:09:49,389
They were very, very nice.

227
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,659
Didn't have a lot of money.

228
00:09:51,692 --> 00:09:55,896
But you know, they were good
people, and they loved Dean.

229
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:57,264
Walt was an intimidating guy.

230
00:09:57,297 --> 00:10:00,067
He was a big guy,
like a woodsman kind of guy.

231
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,936
I remember when I first met
them, he scared me,

232
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:05,005
And I remember
he had huge hands,

233
00:10:05,038 --> 00:10:07,708
And he put his hand
on the back of my head,

234
00:10:07,741 --> 00:10:09,309
And he just said, "you ready?"

235
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:11,278
I just kind of nodded,

236
00:10:11,311 --> 00:10:14,915
Got in the car,
and drove to happy camp.

237
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:18,351
Mm.

238
00:10:18,385 --> 00:10:23,056
Can you talk about
what happened with Dean?

239
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:25,292
What do you remember?

240
00:10:25,325 --> 00:10:26,760
[Sighs]

241
00:10:26,794 --> 00:10:28,696
I was at the hospital,

242
00:10:28,729 --> 00:10:31,932
And I just remember
for the next month

243
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:36,103
Being poked and prodded
by fucking doctors and cops

244
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:39,206
And all kinds of people asking
me that exact same question...

245
00:10:39,239 --> 00:10:40,674
"What happened?"

246
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:42,442
We were playing in the backyard,

247
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:45,813
And to be honest, that's
the last thing I remember.

248
00:10:45,846 --> 00:10:50,150
He was... he was...
He went missing.

249
00:10:50,183 --> 00:10:56,223
How did Walt and...

250
00:10:56,256 --> 00:10:58,225
Are you really gonna...?

251
00:10:58,258 --> 00:11:00,193
Just how did they take it?

252
00:11:00,227 --> 00:11:02,830
[Sniffles]
I don't know, Anne.

253
00:11:02,863 --> 00:11:07,735
Not... not well, I guess.

254
00:11:07,768 --> 00:11:10,370
After, um...

255
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:12,372
After Dean disappeared,

256
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:16,109
They kind of shut off, I guess,
and, uh...

257
00:11:16,143 --> 00:11:18,011
I can't fucking believe this.

258
00:11:18,045 --> 00:11:19,847
Sorry. [Sniffles]

259
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,849
Honey, I think this is the
first time I've seen you cry.

260
00:11:21,882 --> 00:11:23,316
Great.

261
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:26,887
They took about four months
after Dean was gone.

262
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,722
Social services came back

263
00:11:28,756 --> 00:11:32,325
And told me I couldn't live
with the tanners anymore.

264
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:36,196
They deemed the home unfit,
I suppose,

265
00:11:36,229 --> 00:11:39,733
And I was put back
in the system.

266
00:11:39,767 --> 00:11:41,735
I went back to San Diego,

267
00:11:41,769 --> 00:11:44,872
And I stayed
with billeted families...

268
00:11:44,905 --> 00:11:47,975
With foster families
until I was 18.

269
00:11:51,945 --> 00:11:53,213
Guys, what is that?

270
00:11:53,246 --> 00:11:54,815
- Oh, my God.
- What is that?

271
00:11:54,848 --> 00:11:57,484
I don't know. That wasn't there
when I was a kid.

272
00:11:57,517 --> 00:12:00,087
What the fuck is that?

273
00:12:08,962 --> 00:12:10,530
Look at this.

274
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,232
Is this it?

275
00:12:15,335 --> 00:12:17,805
I'm actually nervous.

276
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:22,810
Going to be coming up the town
in just a second.

277
00:12:22,843 --> 00:12:24,177
Okay, good because I don't know

278
00:12:24,211 --> 00:12:26,046
How much Bernadette's
got left in her.

279
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,247
I got lights flashing here.

280
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,382
- What?
- Yeah. Not kidding.

281
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:31,151
Oh, my... yeah, I see it.

282
00:12:31,184 --> 00:12:32,853
Shit. I don't know, man.

283
00:12:32,886 --> 00:12:34,922
- Oh, are we here?
- Oh, shit.

284
00:12:34,955 --> 00:12:37,257
Yeah, the r.V. Park
is right around the corner.

285
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:39,392
- Wow. Look at the sign.
- What is that?

286
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:41,528
Pull over, Josh.
I want to hop out real quick.

287
00:12:41,561 --> 00:12:43,063
Right h... [Sighs] Oh, God.

288
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:44,564
- Just pull over.
- It's okay. It's on the way.

289
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,533
- Keep it running. It'll be fine.
- Just keep it running.

290
00:12:46,566 --> 00:12:48,802
[Indistinct conversation]

291
00:12:50,904 --> 00:12:52,405
[Laughs]

292
00:12:56,977 --> 00:13:00,213
Ready?

293
00:13:00,247 --> 00:13:02,515
[Camera shutter clicks]

294
00:13:02,549 --> 00:13:05,252
This is... everybody always
communicates where they are,

295
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:07,087
Whether you go upriver
or downriver.

296
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,856
This is the klamath.

297
00:13:08,889 --> 00:13:12,125
And if you go upriver,
that's the karuk.

298
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:14,094
That's the tribe that...

299
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:16,529
So, can you tell me
if the beer store

300
00:13:16,563 --> 00:13:18,431
Would be upriver or downriver?

301
00:13:18,465 --> 00:13:20,133
[Laughs]
It would be downriver.

302
00:13:20,167 --> 00:13:21,468
- All right.
- It's actually...

303
00:13:21,501 --> 00:13:23,203
We're going downriver, guys.

304
00:13:23,236 --> 00:13:25,038
- It's all downhill from here.
- Are we gonna make it?

305
00:13:25,072 --> 00:13:27,040
If you can get it...
If you can literally...

306
00:13:27,074 --> 00:13:28,608
Do you even know
what you're doing?

307
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:31,144
Move it 15 feet, then we can
coast all the way down.

308
00:13:31,178 --> 00:13:32,379
Does he know what he's doing?

309
00:13:32,412 --> 00:13:34,514
That's some expert work.

310
00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:36,449
So, what seems to be
the problem there?

311
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:38,518
- Down the road?
- Okay.

312
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:41,121
All right,
just head straight down.

313
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:42,489
This is highway 96.

314
00:13:42,522 --> 00:13:44,858
We're gonna take this
for about 1/4 mile,

315
00:13:44,892 --> 00:13:46,459
And then elk creek
is right up on the left.

316
00:13:46,493 --> 00:13:47,995
Good sign.

317
00:13:48,028 --> 00:13:49,863
Oh, shit.

318
00:13:49,897 --> 00:13:53,033
That's a creepy look.

319
00:13:53,066 --> 00:13:54,401
Here we are.

320
00:13:54,434 --> 00:13:56,003
Wow.

321
00:13:56,036 --> 00:13:57,337
Come here, honey.

322
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:59,072
[Yawns] What? Are we there?

323
00:13:59,106 --> 00:14:00,874
- Yeah.
- Ooh!

324
00:14:00,908 --> 00:14:03,310
Look at that.

325
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:04,611
[Bang]

326
00:14:04,644 --> 00:14:06,613
Shit!

327
00:14:06,646 --> 00:14:08,148
- Bernie's done.
- Dude, that's smoke.

Mike, it's just down this hill?

329

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah.

330
00:14:11,218 --> 00:14:13,053
Is it safe to drive it, though?

331
00:14:13,086 --> 00:14:14,888
That looks like your radiator.

332
00:14:14,922 --> 00:14:16,389
How much further?

333
00:14:16,423 --> 00:14:19,292
It's literally about...
I don't know... 1/4 of a mile.

Yeah. That's a claim.

that means, hey, you know what?

is, you know, it's here.

358
00:15:13,046 --> 00:15:15,348
We got it here.
Let's just get situated.

359
00:15:15,382 --> 00:15:17,017
We can check in
a little later on.

360
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:18,285
Let's just, I mean...

[Rooster crows]

367
00:16:02,562 --> 00:16:04,264
It makes you wonder.

368
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:06,133
There's a lot of people
that go missing around here.

369
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:07,400
I mean, not just in happy camp,

370
00:16:07,434 --> 00:16:10,003
But people go out into the woods

371
00:16:10,037 --> 00:16:13,273
And they just don't come back,
you know.

372
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:17,077
Sometimes nobody ever finds out
what happens to them.

373
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:21,214
I'll show you later, if you go
to the cemetery, you know,

374
00:16:21,248 --> 00:16:23,483
There's white crosses out there,

375
00:16:23,516 --> 00:16:25,352
And most of those white crosses,
that's all that's there,

376
00:16:25,385 --> 00:16:27,154
Is just a cross.

377
00:16:27,187 --> 00:16:32,192
There's no bodies there because
they didn't find anything, so...

378
00:16:32,225 --> 00:16:35,295
About 5:00, I think I got home.

379
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:37,230
It's just starting to get dark
a little bit

380
00:16:37,264 --> 00:16:39,399
'Cause it starting to get dark
early at that point.

381
00:16:39,432 --> 00:16:41,534
And I got home.

382
00:16:41,568 --> 00:16:46,239
There was cop cars all over
at Mike and deano's place,

383
00:16:46,273 --> 00:16:50,043
And I never saw Mike after that.

384
00:16:50,077 --> 00:16:52,245
I mean, I never saw deano,
either,

385
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:54,614
But, I mean,
never knew what happened.

386
00:16:54,647 --> 00:16:57,517
The only thing I heard

387
00:16:57,550 --> 00:17:00,753
Was that there was a bunch
of blood in the backyard,

388
00:17:00,787 --> 00:17:03,590
And I think they found
a shoe or something.

389
00:17:03,623 --> 00:17:06,226
I don't remember much
other than that.

390
00:17:06,259 --> 00:17:08,795
Come here!

391
00:17:08,828 --> 00:17:12,065
Hey, what are you doing,
little buddy?

392
00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:14,534
He's buried
in the cemetery here.

393
00:17:14,567 --> 00:17:16,836
I think they put up a cross
for deano,

394
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:19,306
But I think that's all
they ever did.

395
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:21,208
See you later on?
Yeah.

396
00:17:21,241 --> 00:17:23,810
We're staying down at elk creek,
so we're close by.

397
00:17:23,843 --> 00:17:25,812
So, you gonna be around?
Yeah, I'll be around.

398
00:17:25,845 --> 00:17:28,281
- We'll see you then.
- Yeah, good seeing you.

399
00:17:28,315 --> 00:17:29,816
- Good to see you, man.
- Yeah.

400
00:17:29,849 --> 00:17:32,485

It was so nice to meet you.

403
00:17:38,358 --> 00:17:40,827
They found two people...
Man, woman... up there.

404
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,295
Yeah.

405
00:17:42,329 --> 00:17:43,596
I don't know how long
they'd been dead.

406
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:45,565
Didn't know
what happened to them.

407
00:17:45,598 --> 00:17:48,335
Still don't know what happened
to them, I guess.

408
00:17:48,368 --> 00:17:50,103
Does that happen a lot
in the woods out here?

409
00:17:50,137 --> 00:17:51,704
- Well, a whole lot.
- Yeah.

410
00:17:51,738 --> 00:17:53,706
What do you think happened
to the people up there?

411
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,275
I don't have a clue.

412
00:17:59,179 --> 00:18:01,514
[Birds chirping]

413
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:09,289
Do you remember Mike
and his brother?

414
00:18:09,322 --> 00:18:10,557
Yeah.

415
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,692
Do you remember
when Dean went missing?

416
00:18:12,725 --> 00:18:14,127
Yeah.

417
00:18:14,161 --> 00:18:16,329
They never did find his body.

418
00:18:18,765 --> 00:18:20,700
They abducted Dean somehow.

419
00:18:20,733 --> 00:18:24,304
He must have had some money
or something on him.

420
00:18:24,337 --> 00:18:31,544
Flatlanders, you people being
lost out here in the woods,

421
00:18:31,578 --> 00:18:36,349
You flatlanders
don't belong up here.

422
00:18:36,383 --> 00:18:39,186
Why don't we belong up here?

423
00:18:39,219 --> 00:18:41,621
Because there's people...

424
00:18:41,654 --> 00:18:45,225
There's things out there
in the woods that will get you.

425
00:18:45,258 --> 00:18:51,598
I've heard some screams out here
at night here at my camp.

426
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:56,636
And they raise
the hair on my back.

427
00:18:56,669 --> 00:18:58,238
Really?

428
00:18:58,271 --> 00:19:00,540
That's how scary it is.

429
00:19:00,573 --> 00:19:05,178
Just toodle down the fucking
road where you came from

430
00:19:05,212 --> 00:19:07,514
And get the hell out of here

a little light

come out in the woods.

We have a reservation
for Taylor, Anne.

Okay.

436
00:19:39,546 --> 00:19:41,614
And you look very familiar
to me.

437
00:19:41,648 --> 00:19:43,850
You've been here before.

438
00:19:43,883 --> 00:19:47,487

a little creepy?

a kid, actually.

scare the hell out of us.

No, no, that was a real one.

461
00:20:35,635 --> 00:20:36,903
That was taxidermied.

462

It's a really bad
taxidermy job then.

463
00:20:39,506 --> 00:20:40,673
- Yeah.
- It's fucking plastic.

to you?

For a second, it did.

469

none of you climb up there.

Help you as in hold the camera
while you go, or come with you?

do you want to make?

It just has a totally different
vibe, you know.

It's not what I was
expecting at all.

510

Kyle and I were...
We were friends.

511
00:22:56,042 --> 00:22:59,446
Dean, Kyle, and I
used to hang out all the time

512

When we were kids.

513
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:02,582
I was showing Annie
around the park

514
00:23:02,615 --> 00:23:05,017
And took her into the rec room
here and ran into Kyle.

515
00:23:05,051 --> 00:23:06,786
I got to be honest, man.

516
00:23:06,819 --> 00:23:08,888
I didn't think it would
bother me as much as it does.

517
00:23:08,921 --> 00:23:11,123
But now, being back, you know,
it bothers me.

518
00:23:11,157 --> 00:23:13,092
It bothers me
that they never found Dean,

519
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:14,494
You know what I mean?

520
00:23:14,527 --> 00:23:16,596
Yeah,
they never found anything.

521
00:23:16,629 --> 00:23:19,699
Whatever happened
to Walt and Sandy?

522
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:24,437
I think Walt ended up basically
drinking himself to death.

523
00:23:24,471 --> 00:23:27,940
She, I think, divorced him not
too long after that happened...

524
00:23:27,974 --> 00:23:29,709
Maybe a couple years.

525
00:23:29,742 --> 00:23:32,579
And I never heard anything
about what happened to her.

you disappeared.

528
00:23:36,883 --> 00:23:39,051
He's buried in the cemetery
out here, yeah.

529
00:23:39,085 --> 00:23:41,521
I think there's a stone
for Dean, too, there.

530
00:23:41,554 --> 00:23:43,189
I haven't been out there
in years.

There is a... there is a...

532
00:23:44,757 --> 00:23:46,926
I think there's a little stone,
but... yeah.

533
00:23:46,959 --> 00:23:48,127
Really?

534
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,896
Yeah, we didn't know that.

535
00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:51,931
[Voice breaking] Sorry, man.
It's just... [sniffles]

536
00:23:51,964 --> 00:23:53,800
[Normal voice] It's a lot
of... it's a lot of shit

537
00:23:53,833 --> 00:23:55,602
At all at once.
Yeah, it's all good, man. Yeah.

538
00:23:55,635 --> 00:23:59,472
Does he have, um... A plot?

539
00:23:59,506 --> 00:24:01,874
Yeah, there's...
I think they put up...

540
00:24:01,908 --> 00:24:03,209
They did?

541
00:24:03,242 --> 00:24:06,012
I think Walt ended up
putting up a stone

542
00:24:06,045 --> 00:24:09,048
Probably about a year
before he ended up dying,

543
00:24:09,081 --> 00:24:10,550
Something like that.

544
00:24:10,583 --> 00:24:11,951
Well, can... can we go?

545
00:24:11,984 --> 00:24:14,687
Can you show us?
Do you want to go?

546
00:24:14,721 --> 00:24:16,756
- Yeah, I can show you guys.
- I'd appreciate that.

547
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:18,024
I'd really, really appreciate.
Yeah, not a problem.

548
00:24:18,057 --> 00:24:19,559
Do you think you'll be okay?

549
00:24:19,592 --> 00:24:20,927
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

550
00:24:29,001 --> 00:24:31,504
Do we turn up here or up there?

551
00:24:36,976 --> 00:24:39,478
[Indistinct conversation]

552
00:24:46,553 --> 00:24:49,589
Do you see it?

553
00:24:49,622 --> 00:24:51,090
I'm gonna look.

554
00:24:51,123 --> 00:24:52,592
Yeah, go.

555
00:24:52,625 --> 00:24:53,993
Are you... do you want me
to go with you,

556
00:24:54,026 --> 00:24:55,261
Or do you want to take a minute?

557
00:24:55,294 --> 00:24:57,063
- No, that's okay.
- Okay.

558
00:24:57,096 --> 00:24:59,198
Yeah, I'm just gonna...

559
00:24:59,231 --> 00:25:01,534
[Dog howling in distance]

560
00:25:15,582 --> 00:25:16,816
Yeah.

561
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:18,150
You don't want to go
in the cemetery?

562
00:25:18,184 --> 00:25:19,819
I'm not going in.

563
00:25:19,852 --> 00:25:21,554
Yeah.

564
00:25:21,588 --> 00:25:23,623
See all those white crosses?

565
00:25:23,656 --> 00:25:26,593
Most of those,
there's no bodies there.

566
00:25:26,626 --> 00:25:28,327
So these are all
missing people?

567
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,896
Most of them.

568
00:25:29,929 --> 00:25:31,698
Most of them where it's
just a cross, yep.

569
00:25:31,731 --> 00:25:33,099
It's not just a few.

570
00:25:33,132 --> 00:25:34,901
No, there's a ton of them.

571
00:25:34,934 --> 00:25:36,235
Yep.

572
00:25:36,268 --> 00:25:38,938
What's going on up here?

573
00:25:38,971 --> 00:25:40,573
[Sighs]

574
00:25:40,607 --> 00:25:42,909
People go missing.
Nobody ever knows what happened.

575
00:25:42,942 --> 00:25:44,110
They're just gone.

576
00:25:44,143 --> 00:25:47,714
But you don't want to think
about...

577
00:25:47,747 --> 00:25:51,918
You got to put something
to mark the fact

578
00:25:51,951 --> 00:25:54,020
That someone's not here anymore.

579
00:25:54,053 --> 00:25:56,856
But yeah, you keep looking
around here.

580
00:25:56,889 --> 00:25:58,324
Dean really wasn't
the only one.

581
00:25:58,357 --> 00:25:59,859
No.

582
00:25:59,892 --> 00:26:01,661
There's a lot of people
disappeared.

583
00:26:01,694 --> 00:26:03,830
Like I said, about...
I don't know...

584
00:26:03,863 --> 00:26:05,898
It's probably twice a year
at least

585
00:26:05,932 --> 00:26:08,267
It's in the news
that somebody disappeared,

586
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:10,269
And I'm sure
it's more than that.

587
00:26:10,302 --> 00:26:13,806
Not really anything else
you can say about it.

588
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,008
[Dog whining in distance]

589
00:26:16,042 --> 00:26:19,679
It's a shame.

590
00:26:19,712 --> 00:26:23,282
A lot of good people just aren't
around anymore 'cause of this.

591
00:26:23,315 --> 00:26:26,085
What's "this?"
What do you think "this" is?

592
00:26:26,118 --> 00:26:28,755
I don't know.

593
00:26:28,788 --> 00:26:30,089
Like I said,
I didn't want to say anything

594
00:26:30,122 --> 00:26:32,959
When Mike was right here, but...

595
00:26:35,127 --> 00:26:36,829
Oh, my God.

596
00:26:36,863 --> 00:26:38,765
Yeah.

597
00:26:41,734 --> 00:26:45,938
Guys, I'm gonna go up there
and talk to him for a minute.

598
00:26:55,815 --> 00:26:57,383
Just... you guys just...

599
00:26:57,416 --> 00:27:00,052
Hold back for just a minute,
okay?

600
00:27:00,086 --> 00:27:01,654
I'm gonna...

601
00:27:01,688 --> 00:27:03,322
- All right.
- Make sure he's okay.

602
00:27:03,355 --> 00:27:05,257
Okay.

603
00:27:05,291 --> 00:27:08,728
I don't want to go up there.

604
00:27:38,324 --> 00:27:40,092
You guys good?

605
00:27:40,126 --> 00:27:41,828
Are you okay?

606
00:27:41,861 --> 00:27:43,295
Yeah. Yeah.

607
00:27:49,401 --> 00:27:51,838
Thanks for showing us, Kyle.

608
00:27:51,871 --> 00:27:53,740
Yeah. Not a problem.

00:27:53,773 --> 00:27:56,308
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Jesus Christ!

610
00:27:59,812 --> 00:28:01,247
Well, what the hell was that?

611
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,315
That was probably
your first warning.

612
00:28:03,349 --> 00:28:05,785
You guys might want to get
back to the r.V.

613
00:28:05,818 --> 00:28:08,254
Do you know that guy?

614
00:28:08,287 --> 00:28:11,390
I've seen the truck before.

615
00:28:11,423 --> 00:28:13,926
Probably doesn't like you
snooping around the cemetery.

616
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:16,495
A lot of locals don't like
people nosing around.

617
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:18,898
I'd get back to the r.V.
If I was you.

Don't be wandering
around at night.

- Yeah, let's go.
- All right.

620
00:28:22,434 --> 00:28:24,036
Let's get out of here.

621
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:27,206
It was different.

622
00:28:27,239 --> 00:28:29,075
It was different than I thought
it was gonna be.

623
00:28:29,108 --> 00:28:31,010
Yeah, me too.

624
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:38,985
It was more emotional
than I thought it was gonna be.

625
00:28:39,018 --> 00:28:40,486
- No kidding.
- I didn't expect that.

626
00:28:40,519 --> 00:28:42,088
Yeah.

It was nice seeing Kyle,
though.

It was really nice seeing Kyle.

629

- What did you think of him?
- Oh, man.

630
00:28:47,794 --> 00:28:51,063
I'd like to go to my old house
tomorrow, if that's okay.

631

fucking out there.

No. It was fine.
I don't know.

to go up there alone.

and look for him.

00:32:43,095 --> 00:32:44,530
Yeah, I'm... yep.

711
00:32:44,563 --> 00:32:45,764
You sure?

712
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:47,199
Yeah. There's a clamp.

713
00:32:47,233 --> 00:32:48,400
'Cause you're pissing water,

714
00:32:48,434 --> 00:32:50,136
Like, all over the ground
right now.

715
00:32:50,169 --> 00:32:52,138
No. Oh, shit!

716
00:32:52,171 --> 00:32:54,540
Can you hand me the...

717
00:32:54,573 --> 00:32:56,142
[Grunts]

718
00:32:56,175 --> 00:32:58,144
Why do they do these so tight?

719
00:32:58,177 --> 00:33:00,212
Is this an American?

720
00:33:03,349 --> 00:33:05,217
It's Mike.

721
00:33:09,321 --> 00:33:10,756
I'm just gonna watch this one.

722
00:33:10,789 --> 00:33:12,291
Will she hit him?

723
00:33:12,324 --> 00:33:13,559
I don't know.

724
00:33:13,592 --> 00:33:15,161
Push or hit?

725
00:33:15,194 --> 00:33:16,362
Push or a hit?

726
00:33:16,395 --> 00:33:17,663
Ball check?

727
00:33:17,696 --> 00:33:19,498
- Hey, big guy.
- Hey.

728
00:33:19,531 --> 00:33:21,367
Maybe leave a note next time,
huh?

729
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,302
I'm sorry.

730
00:33:23,335 --> 00:33:24,770
I didn't... i thought you guys

731
00:33:24,803 --> 00:33:26,705
Would honestly
still be sleeping.

732
00:33:26,738 --> 00:33:29,708
I honestly thought
I'd still be sleeping, too.

733
00:33:29,741 --> 00:33:33,245
Well, I went to Al's in town.

734
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:37,049
Got a clamp for the hose.

735
00:33:37,083 --> 00:33:41,387
Josh, you might think about
taking surface roads,

736
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:43,589
That way we don't get caught up
in downtown traffic.

737
00:33:43,622 --> 00:33:45,191
- You sure?
- Yeah.

738
00:33:45,224 --> 00:33:46,792
It can be a nightmare.

739
00:33:46,825 --> 00:33:50,196
It can take upwards
of two minutes to get through.

740
00:33:50,229 --> 00:33:52,198
[Laughter]

741
00:33:52,231 --> 00:33:54,666
[Indistinct conversation]

742
00:33:58,504 --> 00:33:59,771
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

743
00:33:59,805 --> 00:34:01,240
What do you want?

744
00:34:01,273 --> 00:34:03,709
You want to get out
and check that?

745
00:34:03,742 --> 00:34:05,211
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

746
00:34:05,244 --> 00:34:06,478
Getting out?

747
00:34:06,512 --> 00:34:08,614
Yeah, there's a chain thing.

748
00:34:08,647 --> 00:34:11,350
- Okay, go ahead.
- All right.

749
00:34:19,391 --> 00:34:21,660
Yeah, there's nothing we can do
about this.

750
00:34:21,693 --> 00:34:23,295
We're just gonna have to walk.

751
00:34:23,329 --> 00:34:26,098
It's just right here.

752
00:34:27,799 --> 00:34:29,435
- All right.
- Okay.

753
00:34:29,468 --> 00:34:30,702
- How are you doing? You good?
- I'm good.

754
00:34:30,736 --> 00:34:32,571
Yeah.

755
00:34:32,604 --> 00:34:34,373
Come on.

756
00:34:34,406 --> 00:34:35,641
Ooh.

757
00:34:35,674 --> 00:34:37,676
You good?

758
00:34:37,709 --> 00:34:39,245
Yeah.

759
00:34:39,278 --> 00:34:41,580
Jesus.

760
00:34:41,613 --> 00:34:44,616
Why am I having such a hard time
with this?

761
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:48,287
That used to be...
That pond used to be filled.

762
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:51,223
There was never any fish in it,
but Dean and I used to...

763
00:34:51,257 --> 00:34:54,260
Walt got us a couple rods, and
we'd sit out there for hours.

764
00:34:54,293 --> 00:34:55,594
[Chuckles]

765
00:34:55,627 --> 00:34:57,196
We'd have the lines in the water

766
00:34:57,229 --> 00:34:58,497
And constantly be like,
"did you get a bite?

767
00:34:58,530 --> 00:35:00,299
Did you get a bite?"

768
00:35:00,332 --> 00:35:01,600
Like, if anything moved, we'd be
like, "yeah, you got something."

769
00:35:01,633 --> 00:35:03,269
But we never...
Never once caught a fish.

770
00:35:03,302 --> 00:35:09,208
It looked a lot bigger
when I was a kid.

771
00:35:09,241 --> 00:35:11,677
- Oh.
- Careful.

772
00:35:13,645 --> 00:35:15,281
This is it, Mike?

773
00:35:15,314 --> 00:35:16,748
Yeah.

774
00:35:16,782 --> 00:35:19,918
[Sniffles]

775
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:23,622
Do you want to go in?

776
00:35:23,655 --> 00:35:26,625
No. [Laughs]

777
00:35:31,197 --> 00:35:32,564
[Clatter]

778
00:35:32,598 --> 00:35:34,166
Aah!

779
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,368
You okay?

780
00:35:36,402 --> 00:35:38,504
I'm sorry.

781
00:35:41,673 --> 00:35:43,675
This was it.

782
00:35:43,709 --> 00:35:47,846
You wanted the... the real deal.

783
00:35:47,879 --> 00:35:51,317
Believe it or not,
this is considered pretty...

784
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:55,454
Pretty lavish for happy camp.

785
00:35:55,487 --> 00:35:57,789
It's...

786
00:35:59,825 --> 00:36:04,463
So, on the other side of the
house, we had a functional...

787
00:36:04,496 --> 00:36:07,666
A functional kitchen
that was hooked up to a well,

788
00:36:07,699 --> 00:36:10,769
So that's where Sandy
did a lot of the cooking.

789
00:36:10,802 --> 00:36:13,539
And heat came
from a wood-burning stove.

790
00:36:13,572 --> 00:36:16,675
They slept there,

791
00:36:16,708 --> 00:36:23,449
And Dean and I had a cot
that was here.

792
00:36:23,482 --> 00:36:26,685
[Door creaks]

793
00:36:36,728 --> 00:36:39,498
I didn't anticipate it.

794
00:36:39,531 --> 00:36:41,667
It's very different
than what I remember,

795
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:46,004
And I didn't think that was
gonna be as hard as it is.

796
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:47,906
I remember that Dean
was always worried

797
00:36:47,939 --> 00:36:49,375
Every time he'd get a new toy.

798
00:36:49,408 --> 00:36:51,910
He'd always hide stuff around.

799
00:36:51,943 --> 00:36:54,813
He'd always have, like, a hiding
spot under the house

800
00:36:54,846 --> 00:36:57,916
Where he kept, like, a toy box
with everything that he loved.

801
00:37:03,422 --> 00:37:05,724
This was...

802
00:37:05,757 --> 00:37:07,393
This was some of his...

803
00:37:07,426 --> 00:37:10,429
I remember I used to think,
when I was a little kid,

804
00:37:10,462 --> 00:37:12,964
How neat would it be
to call somebody "mom"

805
00:37:12,998 --> 00:37:14,833
And to call somebody "dad."

806
00:37:14,866 --> 00:37:18,270
The one thing I never thought
about is how weird it would be

807
00:37:18,304 --> 00:37:21,273
To actually call them mom
and dad when you see them.

808
00:37:21,307 --> 00:37:22,741
It took a while.

809
00:37:22,774 --> 00:37:24,876
It took a couple...
Almost six months, I think,

810
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:28,814
Before I could call Sandy "mom"
and Walt "dad."

811
00:37:28,847 --> 00:37:34,686
Um... But yeah, it was...
It was nice.

812
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:39,358
It was nice having parents
for the first time.

813
00:37:39,391 --> 00:37:40,892
And after Dean was gone,

814
00:37:40,926 --> 00:37:43,695
It really just became
a matter of time.

815
00:37:43,729 --> 00:37:50,869
I remember... i remember
Walt starting to drink a lot.

816
00:37:50,902 --> 00:37:52,904
Sandy became very depressed.

817
00:37:52,938 --> 00:37:55,907
I mean, Dean was their child,
you know.

818
00:37:55,941 --> 00:37:58,009
They loved me
and I was their son.

819
00:37:58,043 --> 00:38:00,379
- Do you think they blamed you?
- Hmm?

820
00:38:00,412 --> 00:38:03,849
Do you think they blamed you?

821
00:38:03,882 --> 00:38:07,353
[Sniffles]

822
00:38:07,386 --> 00:38:12,591
I don't know what exactly
happened to him.

823
00:38:12,624 --> 00:38:19,665
But I do believe that there is
someone else involved.

824
00:38:19,698 --> 00:38:24,670
There is someone or something
that took him.

825
00:38:26,705 --> 00:38:28,874
He's gone.
He's not coming back.

826
00:38:28,907 --> 00:38:30,542
It doesn't matter what I think.

827
00:38:30,576 --> 00:38:32,678
It doesn't matter
what I could tell them.

828
00:38:32,711 --> 00:38:34,346
It doesn't matter.

829
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:37,015
It's stupid.

830
00:38:37,048 --> 00:38:41,653
You can't change the past,
so it is what it is.

831
00:38:41,687 --> 00:38:43,789
What do you think I'm doing?

832
00:38:43,822 --> 00:38:45,924
What do you think I'm doing?

833
00:38:45,957 --> 00:38:48,427
I'm trying everything I can.

834
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:50,829
We're back at the place
where I lost my brother

835
00:38:50,862 --> 00:38:52,798
And I still can't
fucking remember!

836
00:38:52,831 --> 00:38:54,433
What do you think I'm doing?!

837
00:38:54,466 --> 00:38:56,368
What's the last thing...

838
00:38:56,402 --> 00:38:58,637
I'm sorry. I think we're good.

839
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:00,038
I'm not mad at you, Mike.

840
00:39:00,071 --> 00:39:01,507
I'm trying this
for your stupid film.

841
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:02,708
I'm trying to open up
as much as I can.

842
00:39:02,741 --> 00:39:04,142
I'm telling you
I don't remember!

843
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:05,944
I didn't remember then.
I don't remember now.

844
00:39:05,977 --> 00:39:07,579
What do you want me to tell you?
You want me to fucking lie?

845
00:39:07,613 --> 00:39:09,415
You want to lie for...

846
00:39:09,448 --> 00:39:12,484
No, I just... none of this
is making sense to me at all.

847
00:39:12,518 --> 00:39:14,386
Well, this is it.
This is what you wanted.

848
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:15,954
This is where it happened.

849
00:39:15,987 --> 00:39:19,024
[Voice breaking] I was
sitting here with Dean,

850
00:39:19,057 --> 00:39:21,059
And the last thing I remember...

851
00:39:21,092 --> 00:39:23,161
And then I woke up,
and it was two days later,

852
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:25,397
And everybody was poking
and prodding at me

853
00:39:25,431 --> 00:39:26,732
The same fucking way you are!

854
00:39:26,765 --> 00:39:28,734
And I don't know
what to tell you! I'm sorry!

855
00:39:28,767 --> 00:39:31,537
Okay, I'm sorry that I can't
give you more for your stupid...

856
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:32,871
I'm gonna take off.

857
00:39:32,904 --> 00:39:34,139
I'm gonna...
I'm gonna walk back.

858
00:39:34,172 --> 00:39:36,007
- You're not taking off.
- Yeah. Yeah.

859
00:39:36,041 --> 00:39:38,143
I don't...
I just need an hour or so.

860
00:39:38,176 --> 00:39:39,678
Mike.

861
00:39:39,711 --> 00:39:42,414
Are you guys
just gonna let him walk off?

862
00:39:42,448 --> 00:39:44,015
Mike!

863
00:39:44,049 --> 00:39:45,751
One of you guys go after him.

864
00:39:45,784 --> 00:39:47,486
Teddy, will you...

865
00:39:47,519 --> 00:39:49,621
Mike!

866
00:39:49,655 --> 00:39:51,957
Mike!
Mike.

867
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:53,825
Fuck!

868
00:39:53,859 --> 00:39:55,561
Ted, go check him out.

869
00:39:55,594 --> 00:39:58,163
What the fuck's he doing?

870
00:39:58,196 --> 00:39:59,565
He left.

871
00:39:59,598 --> 00:40:01,833
He's walking to town.

872
00:40:01,867 --> 00:40:04,570
You know what? Just let him go.

873
00:40:04,603 --> 00:40:06,438
We're not...

874
00:40:06,472 --> 00:40:07,773
I know. Come on.
Just let him go.

875
00:40:07,806 --> 00:40:10,175
He does this all the time.

876
00:40:10,208 --> 00:40:13,679
Freezing, and it's like
five Miles away.

877
00:40:13,712 --> 00:40:16,014
Where's he gonna go, you know?

878
00:40:16,047 --> 00:40:17,549
Hell if I know.

879
00:40:17,583 --> 00:40:19,050
You're just gonna let him go?

880
00:40:19,084 --> 00:40:21,086
Yeah, he does this
all the time.

881
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:24,189
How would you feel spilling
all this shit out, you know?

882
00:40:24,222 --> 00:40:26,925
- Anne.
- Anne, he's leaving.

883
00:40:29,094 --> 00:40:31,497
He left.
He's gone.

884
00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:32,998
I know he left.

885
00:40:33,031 --> 00:40:34,533
What did you do?

886
00:40:34,566 --> 00:40:35,867
I didn't do anything, you guys.

887
00:40:35,901 --> 00:40:37,135
You can't push him
to talk about this.

888
00:40:37,168 --> 00:40:39,004
I'm not pushing him.

889
00:40:39,037 --> 00:40:40,606
[Sighs] Teddy,
this is where it happened.

890
00:40:40,639 --> 00:40:42,240
You're sort of pushing him.

891
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:44,009
This is where it happened,
okay? Right here in this spot.

892
00:40:44,042 --> 00:40:46,077
This is the last thing
he remembers, okay?

893
00:40:46,111 --> 00:40:48,079
Right here behind his house?

894
00:40:48,113 --> 00:40:51,817
You could be
a little sensitive to...

895
00:40:51,850 --> 00:40:53,885
You guys, I'm trying.

896
00:40:53,919 --> 00:40:55,887
I didn't know any of this
was going on.

897
00:40:55,921 --> 00:40:57,489
You didn't know
any of this shit?

898
00:40:57,523 --> 00:40:59,157
He's never talked about this
before to me.

899
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:02,160
He painted a completely
different picture.

900
00:41:02,193 --> 00:41:04,830
This is just not at all...

901
00:41:04,863 --> 00:41:06,998
Do you think I would've
come up to this?

902
00:41:07,032 --> 00:41:08,700
This is ridicu... this is crazy.

903
00:41:08,734 --> 00:41:10,702
He lied to you?

904
00:41:10,736 --> 00:41:13,639
I don't know. I don't think
he remembered it this way.

905
00:41:13,672 --> 00:41:15,574
I don't think... i don't...
I don't know.

906
00:41:15,607 --> 00:41:17,208
I don't know
what's going on with him.

907
00:41:17,242 --> 00:41:19,511
[Voice breaking]
He's never done this before.

908
00:41:19,545 --> 00:41:20,746
You guys, we got to go find him.

909
00:41:20,779 --> 00:41:22,147
We'll find him,
but quit having him talk.

910
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:24,583
We got to just go.
We'll go back to town.

911
00:41:24,616 --> 00:41:25,917
Where the fuck could he be?

912
00:41:25,951 --> 00:41:27,886
Well, we're gonna go
back to town.

913
00:41:27,919 --> 00:41:29,254
We'll find him there.

914
00:41:29,287 --> 00:41:31,523
He just needs some time
to cool off, okay?

915
00:41:47,573 --> 00:41:49,541
There's probably only
two places he can be.

916
00:41:49,575 --> 00:41:50,742
[Scoffs]

917
00:41:50,776 --> 00:41:54,012
A bar or in the woods.

918
00:41:54,045 --> 00:41:56,281
Yeah.

919
00:41:56,314 --> 00:41:57,783
There's not much here.

920
00:41:57,816 --> 00:41:59,017
Kicking it with Kyle?

921
00:41:59,050 --> 00:42:02,954
Oh, my God. I mean...

922
00:42:02,988 --> 00:42:05,056
I understand it's difficult
to grow up

923
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:07,092
In the environment that he did,
but...

924
00:42:07,125 --> 00:42:09,795
No, this is, like,
"environment."

925
00:42:09,828 --> 00:42:11,563
This is another planet.

926
00:42:11,597 --> 00:42:13,164
Mike!

927
00:42:13,198 --> 00:42:14,833
Shh.

928
00:42:14,866 --> 00:42:16,835
[Dog barking]

929
00:42:16,868 --> 00:42:18,970
There, that's a good try.

930
00:42:19,004 --> 00:42:22,173
Nice. That was awesome, Ted.
Thanks.

931
00:42:22,207 --> 00:42:23,975
Sheriff's office.

932
00:42:24,009 --> 00:42:26,177
Well, what we could do is...

933
00:42:26,211 --> 00:42:27,913
Knock on the door?

934
00:42:27,946 --> 00:42:29,180
Well, yes.

935
00:42:29,214 --> 00:42:30,649
But let's try to talk to him.

936
00:42:30,682 --> 00:42:32,050
Maybe he knows
some stuff about Dean.

937
00:42:32,083 --> 00:42:33,652
Maybe we can talk to him

938
00:42:33,685 --> 00:42:35,954
About some of the stuff
with Mike's parents,

939
00:42:35,987 --> 00:42:38,123
Maybe they...
About some of the leads.

940
00:42:38,156 --> 00:42:39,891
I don't know.
It doesn't matter.

941
00:42:39,925 --> 00:42:41,993
Like, really?
Does it really matter anymore?

942
00:42:42,027 --> 00:42:43,795
Yeah, it matters.

943
00:42:43,829 --> 00:42:46,598
I mean, obviously, you saw
how upset Mike got back there.

944
00:42:46,632 --> 00:42:48,066
I think we're a little beyond

945
00:42:48,099 --> 00:42:51,737
This fallacy
of what you're trying to do,

946
00:42:51,770 --> 00:42:53,071
And maybe we should
just find Mike

947
00:42:53,104 --> 00:42:54,572
And get the fuck out of here.

948
00:42:57,709 --> 00:42:59,745
That didn't work.

949
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:05,016
Maybe try the yelling thing
again? I don't know.

950
00:43:06,384 --> 00:43:08,687
Guys, we just need to...

951
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:10,622
Mike!

952
00:43:17,996 --> 00:43:20,966
Where is he, the bar?

953
00:43:20,999 --> 00:43:24,169
Could be. I don't know.

954
00:43:24,202 --> 00:43:26,772
There's another door right here,
you guys. Come on.

955
00:43:26,805 --> 00:43:29,174
It's the...

956
00:43:30,809 --> 00:43:32,377
There you go.

957
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:36,147
Check this out. Come on.

958
00:43:36,181 --> 00:43:37,949
Go in there with her.
I'm gonna check upstairs.

959
00:43:37,983 --> 00:43:39,718
Hello?

960
00:43:39,751 --> 00:43:41,853
Come on.

961
00:43:41,887 --> 00:43:43,188
Hello?

962
00:43:43,221 --> 00:43:44,389
[Clatter]

963
00:43:44,422 --> 00:43:47,726
Did you hear that, Josh?

964
00:43:47,759 --> 00:43:50,261
Hello?

965
00:43:52,197 --> 00:43:54,265
Okay?

966
00:43:54,299 --> 00:43:57,803
Excuse me?

967
00:44:03,174 --> 00:44:05,877
Hello?

968
00:44:10,716 --> 00:44:12,383
[Hiss]

969
00:44:12,417 --> 00:44:14,820
Come on, Josh.

970
00:44:14,853 --> 00:44:17,022
Excuse me!

971
00:44:17,055 --> 00:44:18,990
Hello?

972
00:44:19,024 --> 00:44:20,892
Annie!

973
00:44:20,926 --> 00:44:22,994
What?

974
00:44:23,028 --> 00:44:25,196
Oh, my God. Come on, Josh.

975
00:44:25,230 --> 00:44:27,032
Josh, come on.

976
00:44:27,065 --> 00:44:30,168
Teddy! Teddy!

977
00:44:33,038 --> 00:44:34,840
Teddy! Ted!

978
00:44:34,873 --> 00:44:36,775
Ted.

979
00:44:43,348 --> 00:44:45,383
Ted.

980
00:44:45,416 --> 00:44:48,053
That's Mike's brother.

981
00:44:53,291 --> 00:44:55,727
So many.

982
00:45:03,034 --> 00:45:06,337
He's not here. Let's go.

983
00:45:06,371 --> 00:45:08,373
Let's go.

984
00:45:22,153 --> 00:45:23,789
I feel nauseous.

985
00:45:23,822 --> 00:45:27,358
Guys, this thing is bigger
than just Dean.

986
00:45:27,392 --> 00:45:30,528
There's got to be 200 people
on that wall.

987
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:33,832
At least, and then you saw
the graveyard.

988
00:45:33,865 --> 00:45:35,300
Yeah, I saw it.

989
00:45:35,333 --> 00:45:38,236
You guys, we got to find Mike
right now.

990
00:45:39,871 --> 00:45:42,774
A little quiet there, Ted.

991
00:45:45,977 --> 00:45:47,412
Is that Mike?

992
00:45:47,445 --> 00:45:50,281
- Mike!
- Mike!

993
00:45:50,315 --> 00:45:52,951
- Hi there.
- Mike!

994
00:45:52,984 --> 00:45:55,153
No, I don't think so.

995
00:45:55,186 --> 00:45:57,388
Yeah, I am.

996
00:45:57,422 --> 00:45:59,124
Did you wreck it?

997
00:45:59,157 --> 00:46:00,391
It's him.

998
00:46:00,425 --> 00:46:02,460
What the fuck are you doing,
Mike?

999
00:46:02,493 --> 00:46:05,096
- What are you doing?
- Jesus Christ.

1000
00:46:05,130 --> 00:46:07,198
We don't want you here no more.

1001
00:46:07,232 --> 00:46:10,368
What does that even mean,
you know what I did?

1002
00:46:10,401 --> 00:46:11,837
The only way you can come back

1003
00:46:11,870 --> 00:46:13,404
Is if you bring your brother
with you.

1004
00:46:13,438 --> 00:46:14,873
Go.

1005
00:46:14,906 --> 00:46:16,975
Just go!

1006
00:46:17,008 --> 00:46:18,209
Where the fuck were you?

1007
00:46:18,243 --> 00:46:19,978
What the fuck are you doing,
man?

1008
00:46:20,011 --> 00:46:22,147
[Voice breaking]
Where the fuck were you?

1009
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:24,015
- I told you, I wanted...
- No, you're a fucking asshole.

1010
00:46:24,049 --> 00:46:25,951
That's what you are.

1011
00:46:25,984 --> 00:46:28,119
Twice... that's twice today,
you son of a bitch.

1012
00:46:28,153 --> 00:46:30,421
You can't have the decency
to just cut me some time.

1013
00:46:30,455 --> 00:46:32,423
You're the one that wanted...
the decency?

1014
00:46:32,457 --> 00:46:34,592
You didn't have the decency
to walk away from me

1015
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:36,895
Twice today, you son of a...
Fucking asshole.

1016
00:46:36,928 --> 00:46:38,930
This is turning into
a fucking soap opera.

1017
00:46:38,964 --> 00:46:40,431
Does nobody understand...

1018
00:46:40,465 --> 00:46:42,300
Walk away from you, Mike.
How does that feel?

1019
00:46:42,333 --> 00:46:44,569
Mike, we walked around
for hours, looking for you.

1020
00:46:44,602 --> 00:46:46,471
Just have some respect for us,
yeah?

1021
00:46:46,504 --> 00:46:48,173
Do you not...

1022
00:46:48,206 --> 00:46:49,875
I understand the situation,
but just come on, man.

1023
00:46:49,908 --> 00:46:51,342
You don't know what this whole
thing was about?

1024
00:46:51,376 --> 00:46:53,044
All about you, bro.

1025
00:46:53,078 --> 00:46:55,046
What the fuck does that even
mean, it's all about me?

1026
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:56,982
- Just quit yelling.
- What do you think it means?

1027
00:46:57,015 --> 00:46:59,117
We're sitting around for
three hours, looking for you.

1028
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:00,986
I just said I needed a little
bit of time today, that's all.

1029
00:47:01,019 --> 00:47:03,554
You didn't say anything.
That's all. That's the problem.

1030
00:47:03,588 --> 00:47:05,924
Yeah, you just left
for the second time today.

1031
00:47:05,957 --> 00:47:07,225
Listen to me.

1032
00:47:07,258 --> 00:47:09,895
I know you're going through
some shit,

1033
00:47:09,928 --> 00:47:12,864
But just let us know
what you're doing.

1034
00:47:12,898 --> 00:47:14,432
Do you really understand?

1035
00:47:14,465 --> 00:47:17,002
No, I don't pretend
to understand.

1036
00:47:17,035 --> 00:47:19,938
But can you just tell us where
you're going for Christ's sake?

1037
00:47:19,971 --> 00:47:21,539
None of this makes sense
anymore.

1038
00:47:21,572 --> 00:47:23,641
This is not at all
what we signed up for.

1039
00:47:23,674 --> 00:47:25,576
This is exactly
what we fucking...

1040
00:47:25,610 --> 00:47:27,946
You see that?
That's exactly what happened.

1041
00:47:27,979 --> 00:47:30,215
That's exactly
what we fucking signed up for!

1042
00:47:30,248 --> 00:47:32,283
Great.
Why don't you walk away again?

1043
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:37,222
I just needed some space today,
that's all, man. I'm sorry.

1044
00:47:37,255 --> 00:47:39,190
I know.
This is stressful on everybody.

1045
00:47:39,224 --> 00:47:40,425
You think I like doing this?

1046
00:47:40,458 --> 00:47:42,627
- Fuck off, Mike.
- This is retarded.

1047
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:44,195
[Sighs] Annie.

1048
00:47:44,229 --> 00:47:45,964
No, I'm so...

1049
00:47:45,997 --> 00:47:47,999
For Christ's sake, Annie,
what do you want me to say?

1050
00:47:48,033 --> 00:47:50,168
You know, you knew that this was
gonna be fucking difficult.

1051
00:47:50,201 --> 00:47:52,303
What do I want you to say?
Oh, okay. Again, all my fault.

1052
00:47:52,337 --> 00:47:55,640
If you run away...
You run away all day.

1053
00:47:55,673 --> 00:47:57,375
Just let's continue
this conversation

1054
00:47:57,408 --> 00:47:58,910
Maybe at another time.

1055
00:47:58,944 --> 00:48:01,179
Right now, let's go.

1056
00:48:01,212 --> 00:48:02,413
Mike.

1057
00:48:02,447 --> 00:48:04,382
Well, if he can walk away,
so can i.

1058
00:48:04,415 --> 00:48:07,986
- Stop.
- Get away from me.

1059
00:48:10,155 --> 00:48:12,190
Why don't we just go in here,
have a drink?

1060
00:48:12,223 --> 00:48:15,961
Maybe you can calm her down
for five seconds.

1061
00:48:15,994 --> 00:48:17,395
All right.

1062
00:48:17,428 --> 00:48:19,965
And let's get the fuck
out of here tomorrow.

1063
00:48:19,998 --> 00:48:22,133
Yeah, you can check out
the local bar.

1064
00:48:22,167 --> 00:48:23,634
Let's go to the r.V.
And have a drink.

1065
00:48:23,668 --> 00:48:25,536
I don't want to fucking hang
around this town anymore.

1066
00:48:25,570 --> 00:48:28,006
- What do you want to do?
- I want to go home.

1067
00:48:28,039 --> 00:48:29,674
You don't think
I want to stay here?

1068
00:48:29,707 --> 00:48:31,342
We'll get him out of here.

1069
00:48:31,376 --> 00:48:33,644
Have a drink and let's get
the fuck out of here.

[Indistinct conversations]

1071
00:49:06,711 --> 00:49:09,380
To happy camp.

1072
00:49:11,116 --> 00:49:16,054
* this is the worst trip
I've ever been on *

1073
00:49:16,087 --> 00:49:18,156
[Laughs] Ditto.

1074
00:49:18,189 --> 00:49:20,058
He's been gone since.

1075
00:49:20,091 --> 00:49:22,460
Nobody's really heard from him,
so...

1076
00:49:22,493 --> 00:49:24,329
I haven't heard anybody
hear from him.

1077
00:49:24,362 --> 00:49:25,663
Yeah.

1078
00:49:36,707 --> 00:49:38,243
It's a very similar story.

1079
00:49:38,276 --> 00:49:40,145
And they didn't find him
for quite some time.

1080
00:49:40,178 --> 00:49:42,013
I don't think they ever
have found him.

1081
00:49:42,047 --> 00:49:44,082
No, they didn't. No.

1082
00:49:44,115 --> 00:49:45,750
They don't know.

1083
00:49:45,783 --> 00:49:49,554
They remember finding shreds
of his clothes here and there.

1084
00:49:49,587 --> 00:49:51,422
They what?

1085
00:49:51,456 --> 00:49:55,560
They remember finding shreds
of his clothes here and there

1086
00:49:55,593 --> 00:49:58,563
And half of his shoe,
part of his pants.

1087
00:49:58,596 --> 00:49:59,764
It was kind of strange.

1088
00:49:59,797 --> 00:50:01,499
I don't know
what happened there.

1089
00:50:01,532 --> 00:50:03,034
It's really sad.

1090
00:50:03,068 --> 00:50:04,435
We were here in happy camp

1091
00:50:04,469 --> 00:50:06,537
The night
that that child disappeared

1092
00:50:06,571 --> 00:50:07,805
Right across the street.

1093
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:09,274
Okay.

[Sighs]

1095
00:50:16,081 --> 00:50:18,383
Everybody still
thinks about it,

1096
00:50:18,416 --> 00:50:21,086
Still wonders
what the hell happened.

1097
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:24,589
But I never heard anything else
about that.

1098
00:50:24,622 --> 00:50:27,592
Was the town ever the same
after that?

1099
00:50:27,625 --> 00:50:29,127
No. Not at all.

1100
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:31,096
Everybody still thinks about it,

1101
00:50:31,129 --> 00:50:33,431
Still wonders
what the hell happened.

1102
00:50:33,464 --> 00:50:37,535
I promised Annie I wasn't gonna
smoke for this thing.

1103
00:50:37,568 --> 00:50:39,770
That's the least
of our concerns tonight.

1104
00:50:39,804 --> 00:50:41,339
Yep.

1105
00:50:41,372 --> 00:50:43,574
Was the bartender
talking about your dad?

1106
00:50:43,608 --> 00:50:45,610
Yeah, yeah.
I kind of remember him.

1107
00:50:45,643 --> 00:50:48,279
I know he said
he sort of knew Walt,

1108
00:50:48,313 --> 00:50:51,749
But he was closer with him
than I think he was saying.

1109
00:50:51,782 --> 00:50:53,784
He really didn't say much.

1110
00:50:53,818 --> 00:50:57,822
Are you sure you knew
everything about your father?

1111
00:50:57,855 --> 00:51:00,158
I don't know.

1112
00:51:00,191 --> 00:51:01,692
Not now.

1113
00:51:01,726 --> 00:51:04,195
I have no fucking idea,
just to be honest with you, man.

1114
00:51:04,229 --> 00:51:06,264
This is totally different
than what I remember.

1115
00:51:06,297 --> 00:51:08,433
Tommy, come here, babe.

1116
00:51:08,466 --> 00:51:10,101
Yeah, here.

1117
00:51:10,135 --> 00:51:12,770
- Huh?
- You need to talk to this guy.

1118
00:51:12,803 --> 00:51:14,172
- Who the...
- I'll talk to him.

1119
00:51:14,205 --> 00:51:15,573
No, you don't.

1120
00:51:15,606 --> 00:51:18,143
You're that fucking guy
from that fucking...

1121
00:51:21,879 --> 00:51:23,781
Please just...

1122
00:51:23,814 --> 00:51:27,185
- Okay.
- Come on!

- That is so creepy.

What do the local economy
and bigfoot have in common?

00:51:38,429 --> 00:51:40,598
[Laughs] What?

1127
00:51:40,631 --> 00:51:42,667
There's no proof
that either exists.

1128
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:44,635
- Guys, come on.
- We're right there. We're going.

1129
00:51:47,505 --> 00:51:51,876
Oh, my God.

Hey, look, Ted.

pass out and be fine.

- Are you kidding me?

- Is our shit gone?

Because you made this
about something

Mike, relax.

No, no.
There's nothing you can do.

All right.

Not even 1/4 mile back
there was a house.

There was a light on.
I'll walk to it.

00:56:33,458 --> 00:56:34,959
Well, do you have
a better plan?

1235
00:56:34,992 --> 00:56:36,561
No, I don't have a better plan.

1236
00:56:36,594 --> 00:56:38,095
You're gonna hoof it
through the woods

1237
00:56:38,128 --> 00:56:39,964
To try and find a clamp
for an engine part?

1238
00:56:39,997 --> 00:56:41,632
I'll go back. I'll see...
They had a light on...

1239
00:56:41,666 --> 00:56:43,200
I'll see if they have something
to hold...

1240
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:44,769
Mike's running away again
like a little fucking girl.

1241
00:56:44,802 --> 00:56:46,804
Oh, that's nice.
That's really fucking nice.

1242
00:56:46,837 --> 00:56:48,906
I was just trying to come up
with a fucking solution!

1243
00:56:48,939 --> 00:56:50,441
Come up with another one.

1244
00:56:50,475 --> 00:56:52,176
I don't know why that's
such a fucking problem.

1245
00:56:52,209 --> 00:56:54,211
If you want to leave us
in the middle of the woods,

1246
00:56:54,244 --> 00:56:55,680
Then fucking do it, Mike.

1247
00:56:55,713 --> 00:56:56,947
It's got nothing to do
with me leaving!

1248
00:56:56,981 --> 00:56:58,683
I don't want to fucking be here
anymore!

1249
00:56:58,716 --> 00:56:59,984
Well, you're making a pretty
good habit out of it!

1250
00:57:00,017 --> 00:57:01,586
All weekend long, Mike!

1251
00:57:01,619 --> 00:57:03,754
You know what?
Fuck you and fuck you, too!

1252
00:57:03,788 --> 00:57:05,055
I'm gonna go back.

1253
00:57:05,089 --> 00:57:06,491
I'm gonna see
if I can find something

1254
00:57:06,524 --> 00:57:07,958
To fix this fucking problem!

1255
00:57:07,992 --> 00:57:09,827
Well, find a set of tires, too,
while you're at it!

1256
00:57:09,860 --> 00:57:11,161
Man, fuck you! Fuck you!

1257
00:57:11,195 --> 00:57:14,465
Look around!
Look the fuck around, man!

1258
00:57:14,499 --> 00:57:16,100
You got a better idea?

1259
00:57:16,133 --> 00:57:18,235
You got a better
fucking idea, Ted?

1260
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:19,870
No! You don't have a plan!

1261
00:57:19,904 --> 00:57:21,138
What do you want me
to fucking do?

1262
00:57:21,171 --> 00:57:22,840
Walk away then!

1263
00:57:22,873 --> 00:57:25,743
That's what you've been doing
all fucking weekend!

1264
00:57:25,776 --> 00:57:27,612
- Just go. Just go.
- That's not fucking fair.

1265
00:57:27,645 --> 00:57:30,748
That's not fucking fair!
Teddy. Teddy!

1266
00:57:30,781 --> 00:57:32,717
Just go back. I'll go with...

1267
00:57:32,750 --> 00:57:34,785
What do you even fucking know
about it anyway, man?

1268
00:57:34,819 --> 00:57:36,621
I don't pretend to know shit
about it, Mike!

1269
00:57:36,654 --> 00:57:38,255
Then why give me
such a hard fucking time?

1270
00:57:38,288 --> 00:57:40,190
I don't know why
that's why so difficult for you

1271
00:57:40,224 --> 00:57:42,693
To fucking comprehend that I
don't want to stay here anymore.

1272
00:57:42,727 --> 00:57:44,228
None of us want to stay here,
man.

1273
00:57:44,261 --> 00:57:46,697
Fine. Then let me go.
I'll be back in half an hour.

1274
00:57:46,731 --> 00:57:48,699
I'm just gonna see
if I can find something.

1275
00:57:48,733 --> 00:57:51,502
It's a solution
to the fucking problem.

1276
00:57:51,536 --> 00:57:53,103
You're kidding yourself.

1277
00:57:53,137 --> 00:57:54,772
Teddy, just go back to the r.V.
Go back to the r.V.

1278
00:57:54,805 --> 00:57:56,841
Fine.

1279
00:57:56,874 --> 00:57:59,944
You're gonna come?

1280
00:58:02,613 --> 00:58:05,049
Teddy?

1281
00:58:10,955 --> 00:58:12,857
He left.

1282
00:58:12,890 --> 00:58:15,593
What? Let him go.

1283
00:58:17,562 --> 00:58:20,197
Here, take this.

1284
00:58:20,230 --> 00:58:23,200
Awesome idea.

1285
00:58:23,233 --> 00:58:27,538
Can't wait to figure out
how fucked up Mike is.

1286
00:58:27,572 --> 00:58:30,641
[Coughs]

1287
00:58:30,675 --> 00:58:34,679
So, you gonna keep giving me
the silent treatment?

1288
00:58:34,712 --> 00:58:37,081
Watch the branch.

1289
00:58:40,184 --> 00:58:42,953
I'm sorry, okay?

1290
00:58:47,191 --> 00:58:49,126
Annie, come on,
you're being ridiculous.

1291
00:58:49,159 --> 00:58:51,762
I should've let you know
where I was going. I'm sorry.

1292
00:58:51,796 --> 00:58:54,699
Mike, I'm not mad. I'm just...

1293
00:58:54,732 --> 00:58:59,336
I want to get out of here
just as much as you do, okay?

1294
00:58:59,369 --> 00:59:02,640
Can we just call a truce,
please?

1295
00:59:02,673 --> 00:59:05,042
Hmm?

1296
00:59:05,075 --> 00:59:07,111
Give me a hug.

1297
00:59:07,144 --> 00:59:08,779
I love you, okay?

1298
00:59:08,813 --> 00:59:10,247
I love you, too.

1299
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:12,249
Take my hand.

1300
00:59:12,282 --> 00:59:15,185
I think we should build
a fire pit, yeah?

1301
00:59:15,219 --> 00:59:18,122
Pretty sure it has to be dry.

1302

[Crack]

1303
00:59:26,831 --> 00:59:28,866
Did you hear that?

1304
00:59:34,038 --> 00:59:36,206
A lot of animals out here.

1305
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:39,977
Get that fire going.
Maybe we can scare them off.

1306
00:59:40,010 --> 00:59:42,279
Be careful here.

1307
00:59:42,312 --> 00:59:44,348
God, what is that smell?

1308
00:59:48,185 --> 00:59:51,088
Is that your house?

1309
00:59:51,121 --> 00:59:53,290
Yeah.

Mike, did you hear that?

1312

[Gasps] Mike?

Michael.

1324
01:00:47,845 --> 01:00:50,948
What is going on?

1325
01:00:50,981 --> 01:00:52,950
What is going on, Mike?

1326
01:00:52,983 --> 01:00:55,019
- Shh, shh, shh, shh.
- What are these?

1327

What is it?

- Ted, get the light.
- Josh, what is that?

1332
01:01:13,137 --> 01:01:15,072
- Ted, get the fucking light.
- Josh, what is that?

1333
01:01:15,105 --> 01:01:17,107
I don't know, Teddy!
Get the light!

1334

Hello?

1335
01:01:19,143 --> 01:01:21,245
Is that a big dog?

- Wait, Josh, what is it?
- I don't know.

1337
01:01:24,181 --> 01:01:25,950
Tell me what was going on!

1338
01:01:25,983 --> 01:01:28,252
I remember
what happened to Dean!

1339
01:01:28,285 --> 01:01:30,921
Listen. Listen to me.

1340
01:01:30,955 --> 01:01:32,923
We were here.
We were right here.

Dean... he said he was cold.

1344
01:01:42,232 --> 01:01:43,734
He said he was cold.

1345
01:01:43,768 --> 01:01:45,269
We heard something,
and he... come here.

- What happened to him?
- He got up. He got up.

What happened to him?

1348
01:01:48,105 --> 01:01:49,339
And I told him...

1349
01:01:49,373 --> 01:01:51,508
We heard something
and he was scared,

1350
01:01:51,541 --> 01:01:53,110
And he came behind me,

1351
01:01:53,143 --> 01:01:55,946
And I know that because he was
squeezing my arm!

1352
01:01:55,980 --> 01:01:58,949

Come on, run! Move! Move! Move!

Come on, go! Come on, get up.

1421

Come on, come on, come on,
let's go. Move! Move! Move!

1422
01:05:08,605 --> 01:05:10,941
- Oh, my God!

1423
01:05:14,111 --> 01:05:15,612
Don't look! Don't look!

1424

- Oh, my God!
- Annie, no!

1425
01:05:17,714 --> 01:05:21,952
Teddy! Teddy! Help me!
Help me!

1426
01:05:21,986 --> 01:05:24,021
Teddy! No! God, no!

1427
01:05:24,054 --> 01:05:26,223
Annie, he's gone.
He's gone, Annie. Come on.

1428
01:05:26,256 --> 01:05:28,425
Come on, we got to go.
We got to go.

[Dog barks in distance]

1459
01:09:01,405 --> 01:09:04,408
It was just over 700
bone fragments in two weeks,

1460
01:09:04,441 --> 01:09:06,643
And four people
have been identified

1461
01:09:06,676 --> 01:09:08,378
From those bone fragments.

1462
01:09:10,814 --> 01:09:13,450
And we're still finding
body parts.

1463
01:09:17,587 --> 01:09:18,888
And I looked up at the clock.

1464
01:09:18,922 --> 01:09:20,324
That's why I know it was
3 minutes to 12:00.

1465
01:09:20,357 --> 01:09:21,791
And I started hearing...

1466
01:09:21,825 --> 01:09:24,528
It sounded like an animal
being mauled.

1467
01:09:25,562 --> 01:09:27,731
They're out there.

1468
01:09:27,764 --> 01:09:30,166
They are out there.

1469
01:09:31,435 --> 01:09:34,638
They found a guy floating
in the water right down there.

1470
01:09:35,905 --> 01:09:43,413
I know in my mind that they
wouldn't be afraid of me

1471
01:09:43,447 --> 01:09:49,953
As I should be afraid of them
'cause they're bigger than me.

1472
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:57,494
I saw one here up South fork
and I saw one in little creek.

1473
01:09:58,428 --> 01:10:00,464
It freaked me out
'cause I thought, "oh, my God."

1474
01:10:00,497 --> 01:10:02,299
And that was the first thing
I thought...

1475
01:10:02,332 --> 01:10:03,600
Mountain lion or something.

1476
01:10:04,634 --> 01:10:08,838
And all of a sudden,

1477
01:10:08,872 --> 01:10:12,509
It caught whiff of us
for some reason.

1478
01:10:12,542 --> 01:10:16,580
Wind blowing the wrong way
or something.

1479
01:10:16,613 --> 01:10:19,683
That bigfoot took off
up the trail.

1480
01:10:20,717 --> 01:10:22,586
Another of my friends gone.

1481
01:10:22,619 --> 01:10:25,221
People die up and down the river
here all the time.

1482
01:10:26,423 --> 01:10:31,661
A bear can't run that fast
on two legs.

1483
01:10:31,695 --> 01:10:34,864
A bear runs on four legs.

1484
01:10:34,898 --> 01:10:37,934
Bigfoot runs on two legs.

1485
01:10:39,703 --> 01:10:42,005
Oh, dude, they didn't come up
with anything about it,

1486
01:10:42,038 --> 01:10:44,841
But yeah, I'm running out
of friends here.

1487
01:10:45,675 --> 01:10:51,815
It ran up, ran around
the corner into a ravine.

1488
01:10:51,848 --> 01:10:53,950
That's the last we saw of it.

1489
01:10:54,884 --> 01:10:56,453
It stayed right in here.

1490
01:10:56,486 --> 01:10:58,855
It didn't leave
for about a good half-hour.

1491
01:10:58,888 --> 01:11:00,590
It just stayed right in here.

1492
01:11:00,624 --> 01:11:02,459
It was like it was watching us.

1493
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:08,665
Sure, I believe in bigfoot,
but I've never seen bigfoot.

1494
01:11:09,666 --> 01:11:14,771
There's a lot of things that I
can't see that I can believe in.
