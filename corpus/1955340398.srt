1
00:01:17,777 --> 00:01:18,777
Okay.

2
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:21,573
<i> Good morning.</i>
<i> What you doin'?</i>

3
00:02:21,575 --> 00:02:24,176
<i> Besides stalking jp,</i>
<i> of course.</i>

4
00:02:24,178 --> 00:02:26,411
I'm reading the news,
thank you very much.

5
00:02:26,413 --> 00:02:27,579
<i> Oh! </i>
<i> You're reading the news.</i>

6
00:02:27,581 --> 00:02:30,716
<i> You're such a good liar.</i>

7
00:02:30,718 --> 00:02:33,385
Seriously, how do you know
I'm stalking jp?

8
00:02:33,387 --> 00:02:35,420
<i> Because I know you</i>
<i> very, very well.</i>

9
00:02:35,422 --> 00:02:37,322
<i> Oh, wait! Did you tell</i>
<i> your mom 'bout calarts yet?</i>

10
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:38,690
Yeah, I told her.

11
00:02:38,692 --> 00:02:41,160
She's super excited for me
to move across the country

12
00:02:41,162 --> 00:02:42,227
and go to a really
expensive art school.

13
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:43,829
<i> Really?</i>

14
00:02:43,831 --> 00:02:45,564
- No.
<i>- No?</i>

15
00:02:45,566 --> 00:02:47,266
No, I haven't found...

16
00:02:47,268 --> 00:02:49,401
I haven't found
the right time to tell her.

17
00:02:49,403 --> 00:02:51,370
<i> Oh! </i>
<i> Nerve is starting.</i>

18
00:02:51,372 --> 00:02:52,638
<i> Sorry, this is</i>
<i> really important.</i>

19
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:52,638
What's nerve?

20
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,208
<i> It's a game. </i>
<i> Here, just click on the video.</i>

21
00:03:00,648 --> 00:03:02,314
<i> Welcome to </i>
<i> nerve New York City.</i>

22
00:03:02,316 --> 00:03:04,383
<i> Nerve is a 24-hour game.</i>

23
00:03:04,385 --> 00:03:06,618
<i> Like truth or dare,</i>
<i> minus the truth.</i>

24
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:08,687
<i> Watchers pay to watch.</i>

25
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:11,356
<i> Players play to win</i>
<i> cash and glory.</i>

26
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:13,425
<i> Are you a watcher</i>
<i> or a player?</i>

27
00:03:13,427 --> 00:03:15,294
<i> Are you a watcher</i>
<i> or a player?</i>

28
00:03:15,296 --> 00:03:17,496
<i> Are you a watcher</i>
<i> or a player?</i>

29
00:03:17,498 --> 00:03:18,597
<i> It's cool, right?</i>

30
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:22,501
This looks very sketchy.
Is this legal?

31
00:03:22,503 --> 00:03:24,570
<i> I don't know. </i>
<i> Probably not.</i>

32
00:03:24,572 --> 00:03:26,605
<i> Just do it. Just sign up</i>
<i> and watch. Time's ticking.</i>

33
00:03:26,607 --> 00:03:29,641
Okay, signing up. Look, this
is me signing up to watch you.

34
00:03:29,643 --> 00:03:31,777
<i> Vee! You have to sign up</i>
<i> and watch me.</i>

35
00:03:31,779 --> 00:03:33,378
<i> It's very important</i>
<i> that I have watchers.</i>

36
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,646
Hey.
I gotta go,
my mom just got home.

37
00:03:34,648 --> 00:03:36,448
I'll sign up after breakfast.
I promise.

38
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:37,416
<i> Thank you. I love you.</i>
<i> I'll see you in a little bit.</i>

39
00:03:38,651 --> 00:03:39,785
- Bye.
<i>- Bye.</i>

40
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:47,259
I mean, Syd hasn't
gotten into any schools yet.

41
00:03:47,261 --> 00:03:48,760
And she doesn't even care.

42
00:03:48,762 --> 00:03:50,262
You know what?
Sydney doesn't have to care.

43
00:03:50,264 --> 00:03:51,964
She has a trust fund.

44
00:03:51,966 --> 00:03:53,999
And you have something
far more valuable than that.

45
00:03:54,001 --> 00:03:55,500
Here we go.

46
00:03:55,502 --> 00:03:57,703
You have drive,
you have focus.

47
00:03:57,705 --> 00:04:00,339
You have a scholarship
to a local college.

48
00:04:00,341 --> 00:04:02,341
And even though
we can't afford the dorm,

49
00:04:02,343 --> 00:04:05,310
you get to have me
as your new college roommate.

50
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:07,946
Actually, I, um...

51
00:04:09,315 --> 00:04:11,416
I had kind of
a cool idea about that.

52
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:15,420
What if we fixed up
Mike's room

53
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:17,956
and listed you
on airbnb or something?

54
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:22,327
Maybe it's time we finally
go through his stuff

55
00:04:22,329 --> 00:04:24,696
and maybe give
some of it to goodwill.

56
00:04:24,698 --> 00:04:25,964
And I could give you
some space.

57
00:04:25,966 --> 00:04:27,366
I don't want space.

58
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:30,936
I just want you.

59
00:04:32,672 --> 00:04:35,040
Okay.

60
00:04:35,042 --> 00:04:37,643
I'm totally down
with commuting. I can...

61
00:04:37,645 --> 00:04:39,311
I can get my reading done
on the ferry.

62
00:04:39,313 --> 00:04:39,878
Yeah?

63
00:04:41,547 --> 00:04:42,881
That'll work, right?

64
00:04:42,883 --> 00:04:43,749
Yeah.

65
00:05:32,466 --> 00:05:34,533
Let's say,
"go cougars"
on the count of 1, 2, 3.

66
00:05:34,967 --> 00:05:37,369
Go cougars!

67
00:05:37,371 --> 00:05:38,937
Let's go, cougars!

68
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:41,707
Let's go, cougars!

69
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:45,811
Hand me the zoom lens.
Here.

70
00:05:45,813 --> 00:05:47,546
Doesn't it feel
a little unbalanced

71
00:05:47,548 --> 00:05:50,382
if every single yearbook photo
is of jp guerrero?

72
00:05:50,384 --> 00:05:52,417
It's not my fault
he's on the team.

73
00:05:53,486 --> 00:05:54,119
Here.

74
00:05:56,489 --> 00:05:57,723
Okay, guys.
Be careful, careful.

75
00:06:00,126 --> 00:06:01,493
Let's hit it, jp!

76
00:06:01,495 --> 00:06:04,496
All right, let's go!
Let's go! Come on!

77
00:06:04,498 --> 00:06:05,964
Watch out,
watch out, watch out!

78
00:06:05,966 --> 00:06:07,599
You got it.
Yeah, you got it.

79
00:06:07,601 --> 00:06:09,401
All right, be careful.
Careful.

80
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:12,637
Yeah!

81
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:27,652
<i> Let's go, cougars!</i>

82
00:06:27,654 --> 00:06:29,554
<i> Let's hear it</i>
<i> for Sydney Sloane!</i>

83
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:30,956
<i> The girl with the shades.</i>
Let's go, cougars.

84
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:32,424
<i> Ooh, yum!</i>

85
00:06:32,426 --> 00:06:33,959
Let's go, cougars.

86
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:36,161
Liv! Liv!

87
00:06:38,498 --> 00:06:39,765
<i> Show 'em </i>
<i> what we got, cougars!</i>

88
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:44,603
<i> Okay, let's play... </i>
<i> Where you goin', Syd?</i>

89
00:06:44,605 --> 00:06:46,772
<i> We've lost our cheerleader.</i>

90
00:06:46,774 --> 00:06:47,873
<i> Okay, show 'em</i>
<i> what we got, vhs!</i>

91
00:06:49,675 --> 00:06:50,876
Are you ready?
Remember what to do?

92
00:06:50,878 --> 00:06:53,111
- Okay.
- Okay. You're on!

93
00:06:53,113 --> 00:06:55,747
Hey, watchers!
It's Syd baby.

94
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:57,416
I'm counting on you
to get me to the final round.

95
00:06:57,418 --> 00:06:58,850
So don't let me down

96
00:06:58,852 --> 00:07:00,118
and I won't let you down,
i promise.

97
00:07:07,493 --> 00:07:09,861
<i> Go, dude! </i>
<i> Show 'em what we got!</i>

98
00:07:09,863 --> 00:07:11,596
<i> Show 'em what</i>
<i> staten island's really about!</i>

99
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:14,199
<i> Go cheer, baby!</i>

100
00:07:15,668 --> 00:07:16,902
<i> Okay. Okay.</i>

101
00:07:19,138 --> 00:07:20,138
Nerd!

102
00:07:30,049 --> 00:07:31,750
<i> Ooh! </i>
<i> How 'bout that ass, though?</i>

103
00:07:31,752 --> 00:07:32,951
<i> Okay. Thank you, Sydney.</i>

104
00:07:47,934 --> 00:07:49,634
Ah... you guys dared me
to eat dog food.

105
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,737
You can do this!

106
00:07:52,739 --> 00:07:53,672
This is so gross.
This is so gross.
Don't think about it.

107
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:58,577
Okay.
Keep it in.

108
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:08,553
Ty!
Wassup, watchers?

109
00:08:16,095 --> 00:08:19,064
Oh! Money, money!
Oh. Whoa!

110
00:08:19,066 --> 00:08:20,265
I have so many
watchers now.

111
00:08:20,267 --> 00:08:21,933
Yeah, you do. Girl!

112
00:08:21,935 --> 00:08:22,968
I just need to get
in that little box thing.

113
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:24,569
Who's winning now?

114
00:08:24,571 --> 00:08:27,772
Apparently,
this guy named Ryan.

115
00:08:27,774 --> 00:08:28,874
I guess he put peanut butter
on his junk

116
00:08:28,876 --> 00:08:30,242
and let his dog
lick it off.

117
00:08:30,244 --> 00:08:31,676
I could do that.

118
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:33,278
But you don't have a dog.

119
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,813
I could still do it.

120
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:36,248
Or a dick, Liv.

121
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:37,849
Ooh, they're coming up
with your next dare!

122
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:39,017
What is it?
I need something flashy

123
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:40,519
like the peanut butter thing.

124
00:08:40,521 --> 00:08:41,253
- Hey.
- Hey.

125
00:08:41,255 --> 00:08:42,687
Hey!
Hey.

126
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:44,589
My god, how weird.

127
00:08:44,591 --> 00:08:45,957
How do they know
you're afraid of heights?

128
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:47,058
- What?
- That's what they do.

129
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,693
It's easy.

130
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:50,095
They just take all your info
from your old profiles

131
00:08:50,097 --> 00:08:51,129
and put it
in your nerve profile.

132
00:08:51,131 --> 00:08:52,264
That's so creepy.

133
00:08:52,266 --> 00:08:54,132
You just got suspended.

134
00:08:54,134 --> 00:08:55,600
I thought you were
done playing nerve.

135
00:08:55,602 --> 00:08:57,035
Hell no!

136
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:58,870
The girl who won Seattle
now has millions of followers.

137
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:00,872
She is insta-famous.

138
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:03,275
- Who cares?
- I care, vee.

139
00:09:03,277 --> 00:09:04,609
I don't expect you
to understand.

140
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:07,546
I'm an adrenaline junkie.

141
00:09:07,548 --> 00:09:09,247
You like to stay within your
comfort zone. That's fine.

142
00:09:09,249 --> 00:09:10,982
That's not true.

143
00:09:10,984 --> 00:09:12,817
What about that
pole dancing class we took?

144
00:09:12,819 --> 00:09:15,186
Vee, I dragged you there
and you sat in the corner
and watched.

145
00:09:15,188 --> 00:09:16,955
I'm a visual learner.

146
00:09:16,957 --> 00:09:18,290
Why are you attacking her?

147
00:09:18,292 --> 00:09:20,058
I'm not attacking her,
Tommy.
Yeah, you are.

148
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:20,058
Life is passing you by.

149
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:23,895
You need to learn
to take a few risks
every once in a while.

150
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:25,697
I do take risks.

151
00:09:25,699 --> 00:09:28,233
Really?
Okay. Fine.

152
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:31,703
Let's just say hypothetically
you're playing nerve.

153
00:09:31,705 --> 00:09:33,204
What'd be a good
nerve dare for vee?

154
00:09:33,206 --> 00:09:34,072
Make out with jp.

155
00:09:35,675 --> 00:09:36,741
Baby steps. Baby steps.

156
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:37,943
Just talk to jp.

157
00:09:37,945 --> 00:09:39,578
What?

158
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,046
He probably
likes you, too.

159
00:09:41,048 --> 00:09:42,948
You'll just never know
if you don't talk to him.

160
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:44,149
And then everybody
that's watching you,

161
00:09:44,151 --> 00:09:45,317
they would just
go on and vote.

162
00:09:45,319 --> 00:09:48,053
Who wants to see
vee mackin' on jp?

163
00:09:48,055 --> 00:09:49,354
Oh, my god!

164
00:09:49,356 --> 00:09:51,189
You guys!

165
00:09:51,191 --> 00:09:52,290
All who wanna see
vee macking on jp say, "yes."

166
00:09:52,292 --> 00:09:54,125
Yes!

167
00:09:54,127 --> 00:09:56,328
Yes. Yes.
I assume, "no"?

168
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:58,229
Abstain.
Thank you.

169
00:09:58,231 --> 00:09:59,965
All right.
You've been dared.

170
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:02,667
Do you accept
your dare, vee?

171
00:10:03,302 --> 00:10:05,804
Say, "yes." Say, "yes."

172
00:10:05,806 --> 00:10:07,806
What's the point?
We're graduating. I...

173
00:10:07,808 --> 00:10:09,207
All you have to do
is say, "hi."

174
00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:10,709
I don't want
to say hello to him.

175
00:10:10,711 --> 00:10:12,110
Fine.

176
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:15,347
I love you so much, vee.
But you're a watcher.

177
00:10:15,349 --> 00:10:17,182
So watch me do it for you.

178
00:10:17,184 --> 00:10:18,350
No, no, no,
Syd, Syd, Syd.
Just watch.

179
00:10:18,352 --> 00:10:20,118
No, no, no! Syd, no.

180
00:10:21,688 --> 00:10:23,321
Yeah! Sydney!

181
00:10:23,323 --> 00:10:25,023
Why don't you show us
the front next time?

182
00:10:25,025 --> 00:10:28,159
You first, Chuck.
I hear it's really big.

183
00:10:28,161 --> 00:10:30,996
Guess it's average.

184
00:10:30,998 --> 00:10:32,797
Uh... hey, jp.

185
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,866
What's up?

186
00:10:34,868 --> 00:10:36,968
Um... I was wondering.
Do you have
a girlfriend right now?

187
00:10:38,204 --> 00:10:39,270
No!

188
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:42,407
It's not for me.
It's for a friend.

189
00:10:44,343 --> 00:10:45,710
Well, which friend?

190
00:10:56,922 --> 00:10:58,256
Um...

191
00:10:58,258 --> 00:10:59,858
No, it's...
She's not my type.

192
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:04,863
You're not nearly as hot
as you think you are.

193
00:11:04,865 --> 00:11:05,864
Yes, he is!
And you are a douchebag.

194
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,000
No, don't go! Come on!

195
00:11:09,902 --> 00:11:11,436
Vee! Vee!

196
00:11:11,438 --> 00:11:12,671
Just let her go.

197
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:15,707
Not cool, Sydney.

198
00:11:15,709 --> 00:11:17,409
I'm just trying to help her.

199
00:11:17,411 --> 00:11:18,843
Let's not help her.

200
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:19,878
She'll figure it out.

201
00:12:25,144 --> 00:12:28,046
<i> Hello. Welcome to nerve.</i>

202
00:12:28,048 --> 00:12:30,415
<i> You have chosen player.</i>

203
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:32,450
<i> Nerve is a direct democracy.</i>

204
00:12:32,452 --> 00:12:34,319
<i> Watchers decide your dares.</i>

205
00:12:34,321 --> 00:12:35,987
<i> The two players</i>
<i> with the most watchers</i>

206
00:12:35,989 --> 00:12:37,789
<i> by the end of regulation</i>

207
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:39,257
<i> will advance</i>
<i> to the final round,</i>

208
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:41,126
<i> where the winner</i>
<i> takes all.</i>

209
00:12:41,128 --> 00:12:43,027
<i> Watchers can watch</i>
<i> from anywhere,</i>

210
00:12:43,029 --> 00:12:44,496
<i> but they are encouraged</i>
<i> to film live.</i>

211
00:12:44,498 --> 00:12:46,097
<i> So don't be alarmed.</i>

212
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:47,966
<i> There are three rules.</i>

213
00:12:47,968 --> 00:12:51,236
<i> One, all dares must be filmed</i>
<i> on the player's phone.</i>

214
00:12:51,238 --> 00:12:53,371
<i> Two, there are only</i>
<i> two ways to be eliminated.</i>

215
00:12:53,373 --> 00:12:55,507
<i> Fail or bail.</i>

216
00:12:55,509 --> 00:12:58,143
<i> Three,</i>
<i> snitches get stitches.</i>

217
00:12:58,145 --> 00:13:00,178
<i> Thank you for</i>
<i> keeping nerve a secret.</i>

218
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:01,112
<i> Good luck, player.</i>

219
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:29,908
<i> Hey, this is vee, </i>
<i> I'm not here right now...</i>

220
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:32,343
<i> Vee! You have to </i>
<i> sign up and watch me.</i>

221
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,485
<i> For account information,</i>
<i> press one.</i>

222
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:42,153
<i> For phone or credit card</i>
<i> information and payment...</i>

223
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:48,259
Tommy.
<i> Hey, </i>
<i> I'm pulling up outside.</i>

224
00:13:48,261 --> 00:13:49,394
<i> What the hell's so urgent?</i>

225
00:13:49,396 --> 00:13:51,830
We have to go
to colonnade diner.

226
00:13:51,832 --> 00:13:51,830
- We have 15 minutes.
<i>- Why? What's going on?</i>

227
00:13:51,832 --> 00:13:54,999
I signed up for nerve and
that's where my first dare is.

228
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:56,568
What do you mean?
You signed up as a player?

229
00:13:58,404 --> 00:14:00,438
Oh, man.

230
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,273
What?
Is that so hard to believe?

231
00:14:07,146 --> 00:14:09,581
You know that some kid
supposedly died
in Seattle playing nerve?

232
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:11,449
Oh, I don't buy that.

233
00:14:11,451 --> 00:14:14,018
If kids were dying,
the game would be shut down.

234
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:16,321
No, they can't shut it down.
There's not a single server.

235
00:14:16,323 --> 00:14:17,589
What does that mean?

236
00:14:17,591 --> 00:14:19,190
Everybody that logs
onto the game

237
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:21,259
becomes a new server.

238
00:14:21,261 --> 00:14:23,528
So it's impossible
to turn the game off.

239
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:24,596
How do you even know
so much about this game?

240
00:14:24,598 --> 00:14:26,231
You've never even played.

241
00:14:26,233 --> 00:14:28,333
Look, I spend a lot of time
on the dark web, all right?

242
00:14:28,335 --> 00:14:29,434
Oh, a lot of time
on the dark web?

243
00:14:29,436 --> 00:14:30,468
Is that right, hacker boy?

244
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:32,103
Yes, that is right.

245
00:14:32,105 --> 00:14:34,205
You're only accessing
10% of the Internet, you know.

246
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:39,878
Why are you even doing this?
Seriously, it's dangerous.

247
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,579
Is it because of Sydney?

248
00:14:41,581 --> 00:14:43,882
This is not about Sydney.
I'm...

249
00:14:43,884 --> 00:14:45,216
It's just not like you.

250
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:48,152
That's the point.

251
00:14:51,892 --> 00:14:54,125
Kiss a stranger
for five seconds?
A stranger?

252
00:14:54,127 --> 00:14:55,526
Vee, I'll give you $100.

253
00:15:04,536 --> 00:15:06,271
Okay, okay.

254
00:15:06,273 --> 00:15:07,639
You're just gonna
kiss some random person?

255
00:15:12,611 --> 00:15:13,444
Oh...
He has a girlfriend.

256
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:15,380
Hi.

257
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:26,991
Ugh!

258
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:31,996
Just kiss that guy.

259
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,602
Okay. I'm gonna
kiss that guy.

260
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:39,070
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

261
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:41,439
Gonna do it.

262
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:45,310
Or that guy.

263
00:15:45,312 --> 00:15:46,444
He reads.

264
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:51,015
Well, make a choice.
Clock's ticking.

265
00:15:51,017 --> 00:15:52,016
Hey.
Hey.

266
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:55,186
I'm kissing that guy.

267
00:15:55,188 --> 00:15:57,322
Okay, you sit here.

268
00:15:57,324 --> 00:15:58,957
Tell me when
you're rolling, 'Kay?

269
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:00,325
'Kay, it's
<i> mission impossible</i> now?

270
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:02,093
Just go.

271
00:16:17,443 --> 00:16:20,611
<i> To the lighthouse,</i>
that's my favorite book.

272
00:16:20,613 --> 00:16:21,579
Really?

273
00:16:26,018 --> 00:16:27,318
Please, tell me they get
to the lighthouse in the end.

274
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:29,754
Um...

275
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:32,657
Actually, don't tell me.

276
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:33,758
Uh... okay,
just tell me real quick.

277
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,661
Yeah, they do,
but that's...

278
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:37,695
That's not really
what it's about.

279
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:40,098
The lighthouse
means something

280
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,299
different to each
of the characters.

281
00:16:41,301 --> 00:16:42,667
It basically represents

282
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:44,736
the thing
they want most in life.

283
00:16:44,738 --> 00:16:48,106
And I'm sorry that
I'm totally geeking out
and ruining the story.

284
00:16:48,108 --> 00:16:49,340
No, I was the one who asked.

285
00:16:50,776 --> 00:16:51,609
Um...

286
00:17:01,553 --> 00:17:03,187
One
Mississippi, two Mississippi,

287
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:04,288
three Mississippi, four
Mississippi, five Mississippi.

288
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:05,256
Done.

289
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:06,657
Done.

290
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:07,759
Done.

291
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:13,031
Okay.
Okay, bye.

292
00:17:16,101 --> 00:17:17,468
I can't believe
i just did that!

293
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:18,636
Shut up! Oh. Gosh,
why am I embarrassed?

294
00:17:19,338 --> 00:17:20,772
Did you get it?

295
00:17:20,774 --> 00:17:23,241
Yeah, it was a miniseries.
I got all six episodes.

296
00:17:25,277 --> 00:17:26,110
Where did he go?

297
00:17:26,678 --> 00:17:27,812
I have no clue.

298
00:17:33,152 --> 00:17:35,219
"Vee, $100 has been
wired to your account."

299
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:36,254
Should I check?

300
00:17:36,256 --> 00:17:37,455
Should totally check.

301
00:17:46,331 --> 00:17:47,498
What is he doing?

302
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,534
I have no clue.

303
00:18:06,486 --> 00:18:07,819
He's singing to me.

304
00:18:07,821 --> 00:18:10,121
No, it's a dare.
It's a dare.

305
00:18:30,843 --> 00:18:32,276
You got it.

306
00:18:37,483 --> 00:18:38,783
Thank you.
Good job.

307
00:18:38,785 --> 00:18:40,251
You won your dare.
Congratulations.

308
00:18:41,587 --> 00:18:43,321
Back at ya.

309
00:18:43,323 --> 00:18:44,889
Mine was totally
embarrassing,

310
00:18:44,891 --> 00:18:47,391
but, hey, at least
i got 100 bucks, right?

311
00:18:47,393 --> 00:18:49,260
I'm sorry.

312
00:18:49,262 --> 00:18:50,428
I promise I didn't know
what was comin'. You mind?

313
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:51,863
Sorry, I'm sitting here.

314
00:18:51,865 --> 00:18:54,298
They just told me to sit
in that booth and... sorry.

315
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,466
Um... some kid came by
and gave me that book.

316
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:59,170
<i> To the lighthouse,</i>
yeah, my favorite.

317
00:18:59,172 --> 00:19:01,305
Exactly. Because
it's on your Facebook page.

318
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:02,607
They know all the information
about you, vee.

319
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:04,542
Your name's vee?

320
00:19:05,844 --> 00:19:07,478
Short for Venus.

321
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,280
I like that.

322
00:19:09,282 --> 00:19:11,282
Well, her parents,
they named her
after the goddess of love.

323
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:13,718
There's a Roman myth.

324
00:19:16,922 --> 00:19:18,489
Yeah, I guess my mom
was expecting somebody else.

325
00:19:20,225 --> 00:19:22,627
I dunno about that.
That was some kiss.

326
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:27,231
I got a game to play.
But good night to you guys.

327
00:19:27,233 --> 00:19:28,232
Thank you.

328
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:36,674
What?

329
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:42,580
Apparently, the watchers
like us together.

330
00:19:42,582 --> 00:19:44,649
I mean, you can't even
go to the city, right?

331
00:19:44,651 --> 00:19:46,584
You know, I can't go
to the city, yeah.

332
00:19:46,586 --> 00:19:49,453
I'm not even playing,
i was just doing one dare.

333
00:19:49,455 --> 00:19:51,322
You sure? It's 200 bucks.

334
00:19:51,324 --> 00:19:53,457
Uh...
She's pretty sure, man.

335
00:19:56,495 --> 00:19:57,695
He always tell you
what to do?

336
00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:01,199
No. No, he doesn't.

337
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,406
I'm gonna be outside
if you change your mind.

338
00:20:08,408 --> 00:20:09,273
It's nice to meet you, vee.

339
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:11,976
See ya, man.

340
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,547
He thought that
those were our fries.

341
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,354
I could use 200 bucks.

342
00:20:23,356 --> 00:20:24,956
Vee, you're not going
to the city.

343
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:26,591
You said one dare.

344
00:20:30,662 --> 00:20:31,696
I'm sorry.

345
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:35,967
You know what?
Charles manson was a singer.

346
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:47,245
I was hoping you'd come.

347
00:20:52,017 --> 00:20:55,653
I'm just warning you,
i don't think I'd make
a very good partner.

348
00:20:55,655 --> 00:20:57,888
I'm not
the daredevil type.

349
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:01,459
You should team up with
my friend Sydney, actually.

350
00:21:01,461 --> 00:21:02,593
She's obsessed
with playing nerve.

351
00:21:04,963 --> 00:21:08,299
But the watchers want me
to team up with you.

352
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:28,886
The second I feel
uncomfortable, I'm out.

353
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:30,655
That's fair.

354
00:21:40,866 --> 00:21:41,899
Okay.

355
00:21:55,447 --> 00:21:56,414
Hold on.

356
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:55,005
I just have to
go to the bathroom.

357
00:22:57,876 --> 00:22:59,410
Oh, my god.

358
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:08,886
Excuse me, ladies?
Ladies?

359
00:23:09,988 --> 00:23:11,021
Hey,
where are you going?

360
00:23:12,158 --> 00:23:14,158
Please, let me fart on you.
Please!

361
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,659
Oh, my god, oh, my god!

362
00:23:15,661 --> 00:23:17,461
Oh, my god.

363
00:23:17,463 --> 00:23:19,830
It's going up so fast!
I know.

364
00:23:19,832 --> 00:23:22,166
Who's your favorite player?

365
00:23:22,168 --> 00:23:24,435
Well, I mean,
i was gonna say you, but...

366
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:26,637
Now I don't know.

367
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:30,174
Is that vee?

368
00:23:30,176 --> 00:23:32,743
Yeah, she's playing nerve
and she has, like,
a lot of watchers.

369
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:34,712
Oh, my god, girl!

370
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:44,522
Hey, try screaming.

371
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:47,158
No.
Just do it.
Let it out!

372
00:23:50,462 --> 00:23:51,495
There you go.

373
00:24:04,709 --> 00:24:05,810
All right, this is it.

374
00:24:08,213 --> 00:24:09,547
Am I supposed
to come in with you?

375
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:11,048
Uh...

376
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:14,051
Doesn't say
anything about that.

377
00:24:16,521 --> 00:24:18,189
Well, thank you
for the lift.

378
00:24:20,692 --> 00:24:22,493
You gonna be okay?

379
00:24:22,495 --> 00:24:24,895
Yeah, yeah, no, I'm...

380
00:24:24,897 --> 00:24:26,764
I'm tired,
so I'm probably just gonna

381
00:24:26,766 --> 00:24:27,598
make my way back home.

382
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:29,633
Um...

383
00:24:31,069 --> 00:24:32,570
This was fun.

384
00:24:32,572 --> 00:24:33,737
Yeah.

385
00:24:33,739 --> 00:24:35,172
I just gotta... you know.

386
00:24:35,174 --> 00:24:36,006
Okay.

387
00:24:54,693 --> 00:24:56,260
You got three more steps.

388
00:24:56,262 --> 00:24:57,895
If you keep up
the exercises,

389
00:24:57,897 --> 00:24:59,597
you're gonna get
really strong on that.

390
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:01,999
Excellent.

391
00:25:02,001 --> 00:25:02,833
Thanks, miss.

392
00:25:06,605 --> 00:25:08,005
Somebody's sending
vee money.

393
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:10,608
White people problems.

394
00:25:12,277 --> 00:25:13,143
What is she doing?

395
00:25:26,925 --> 00:25:28,792
And you have
your receipt.

396
00:25:28,794 --> 00:25:30,961
So thank you so much
for shopping at Bergdorf's.

397
00:25:30,963 --> 00:25:33,597
You have a wonderful day.
Excuse me. Um... sorry.

398
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:34,732
Do you know where I can
find this dress?

399
00:25:35,734 --> 00:25:36,867
Your mom's calling.

400
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:39,737
Shit!

401
00:25:42,774 --> 00:25:44,275
That's very expensive.

402
00:25:46,278 --> 00:25:47,745
Couture. Fourth floor.

403
00:25:47,747 --> 00:25:48,746
Thanks.

404
00:26:34,693 --> 00:26:36,026
Please, don't undress
the mannequin.

405
00:26:37,028 --> 00:26:38,629
Sorry.

406
00:26:38,631 --> 00:26:40,064
Would you like to
try this on?

407
00:26:41,066 --> 00:26:42,066
Mmm-hmm.

408
00:26:44,069 --> 00:26:46,136
Let me see if
i have it in your size.

409
00:26:46,138 --> 00:26:47,338
Thank you.

410
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:48,772
If you could hurry up,

411
00:26:48,774 --> 00:26:50,140
I'm a little bit late
for a party.

412
00:26:50,142 --> 00:26:51,809
Cute.

413
00:26:51,811 --> 00:26:52,943
Okay. Right this way.

414
00:26:55,914 --> 00:26:57,214
If you need anything else,
just let me know.

415
00:26:57,216 --> 00:26:59,083
- Okay, thank you.
- Oh. All right.

416
00:27:31,916 --> 00:27:33,884
Okay. Dressed.

417
00:27:36,921 --> 00:27:37,955
Hello?

418
00:27:41,693 --> 00:27:43,160
Everything okay?

419
00:27:43,162 --> 00:27:44,762
Everything is great,
thank you.

420
00:28:07,952 --> 00:28:11,021
Hey. What's your email number?
I mean your...

421
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:14,291
What's your info?

422
00:28:14,293 --> 00:28:15,793
Oh, this? This old thing?

423
00:28:15,795 --> 00:28:16,427
Vee!

424
00:28:17,395 --> 00:28:18,295
Oh.

425
00:28:19,731 --> 00:28:20,431
Hey.

426
00:28:21,066 --> 00:28:22,800
Hi.

427
00:28:22,802 --> 00:28:24,902
You, uh...
You look very pretty.

428
00:28:24,904 --> 00:28:26,837
Thanks. So do you.

429
00:28:26,839 --> 00:28:28,439
I mean you look, you know,
hot, or handsome or...

430
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:34,745
Do you know what we're
supposed to do now?

431
00:28:34,747 --> 00:28:38,048
The watchers would like me

432
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:40,918
to complete your ensemble,
<i> mademoiselle.</i>

433
00:28:50,328 --> 00:28:52,196
Neither. Is that an option?

434
00:28:56,869 --> 00:28:59,069
All right, how 'bout
my firstborn son, too? Yeah?

435
00:29:13,985 --> 00:29:15,753
What are you doing, vee?

436
00:29:15,755 --> 00:29:17,187
How much are they, sir?

437
00:29:17,189 --> 00:29:19,757
That'll be $900, madam.

438
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:22,326
Oh, in that case,
I'll take two.

439
00:29:22,328 --> 00:29:25,162
One for the city
and one for the Hamptons.

440
00:29:25,164 --> 00:29:26,797
Excellent choice,
<i> mademoiselle.</i>

441
00:29:28,533 --> 00:29:29,867
I'll wrap them up for you
right away.

442
00:29:43,783 --> 00:29:45,482
Um, I'll see ya downstairs?

443
00:29:45,484 --> 00:29:46,817
Uh... yeah, sure.

444
00:29:46,819 --> 00:29:47,985
Okay. All right.

445
00:29:52,924 --> 00:29:53,891
What?

446
00:30:06,905 --> 00:30:08,272
Oh, excuse me, miss!

447
00:30:08,274 --> 00:30:09,173
Did you move
my clothes in there?

448
00:30:09,175 --> 00:30:10,140
Of course not.

449
00:30:17,248 --> 00:30:18,282
This is not happening.

450
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:20,417
This is not happening.

451
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:25,022
Vee?

452
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:26,290
Vee?

453
00:30:26,292 --> 00:30:27,391
Ian.

454
00:30:27,393 --> 00:30:28,292
Hey.

455
00:30:30,061 --> 00:30:31,528
Did you take my stuff? I mean,
my wallet, my clothes.

456
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:32,896
Everything's gone.

457
00:30:32,898 --> 00:30:33,564
No, my stuff is gone, too.

458
00:30:39,304 --> 00:30:41,104
No.

459
00:30:41,106 --> 00:30:42,339
Okay, um...
No. No.

460
00:30:42,341 --> 00:30:43,874
Come on, we have to
make a run for it.

461
00:30:43,876 --> 00:30:46,076
Come on, let's go.
I am not shoplifting!

462
00:30:46,078 --> 00:30:46,610
We don't have a choice.
Come on!

463
00:30:51,983 --> 00:30:53,917
Okay, technically,

464
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:55,219
it just says
we have to leave the store.

465
00:30:57,989 --> 00:30:59,022
Right?

466
00:31:34,292 --> 00:31:35,359
Let's go.

467
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:45,202
Come on, come on!
Let's go!

468
00:31:50,208 --> 00:31:51,408
Mmm...

469
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:00,651
Um...

470
00:32:11,229 --> 00:32:12,996
Sorry, buddy, we need
to come through. Sorry.

471
00:32:17,135 --> 00:32:18,168
Excuse me! Excuse me!

472
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:35,953
That's enough, that's enough.
Let's go, come on, come on.

473
00:32:35,955 --> 00:32:36,553
Whoa, whoa, hey,
stop, stop, stop!

474
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:41,024
Please tell me
these are our clothes!

475
00:32:42,327 --> 00:32:43,260
They kind of are.

476
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:46,063
Are these stolen?

477
00:32:47,732 --> 00:32:49,399
Receipt.

478
00:32:49,401 --> 00:32:50,734
<i> We get to keep 'em?</i>

479
00:32:50,736 --> 00:32:52,035
<i> All yours.</i>

480
00:32:52,037 --> 00:32:53,603
All right.

481
00:32:53,605 --> 00:32:55,038
Hey, can I get the check?

482
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:57,975
Who paid for these?

483
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:02,980
Probably one of the watchers
with daddy's credit card.

484
00:33:06,551 --> 00:33:07,584
What?
Look!

485
00:33:13,659 --> 00:33:15,759
I'm sorry, was that
a wu-tang reference?

486
00:33:15,761 --> 00:33:16,760
Staten island, represent!

487
00:33:16,762 --> 00:33:17,728
Okay.

488
00:33:22,266 --> 00:33:23,767
Saint mark's, 10 minutes?

489
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:39,750
Hello.

490
00:33:39,752 --> 00:33:41,718
Tommy, what
does vee think she's doing?

491
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,020
Have you ever
parked a car in your life?

492
00:33:43,022 --> 00:33:44,221
I got this, girl.

493
00:33:45,456 --> 00:33:47,324
<i> I have no idea, Syd.</i>

494
00:33:47,326 --> 00:33:49,326
Why are you asking me?
I'm not her boyfriend.

495
00:33:49,328 --> 00:33:51,328
<i> Well, who's this biker </i>
<i> she's teamed up with?</i>

496
00:33:51,330 --> 00:33:53,697
<i> I have no clue. </i>
<i> She just ditched me.</i>

497
00:33:53,699 --> 00:33:56,233
She's doing what
she apparently thinks
is best for herself.

498
00:33:56,235 --> 00:33:57,367
Yeah,
and what exactly is that?

499
00:33:57,369 --> 00:33:58,702
Sydney! Syd!

500
00:33:58,704 --> 00:33:59,770
Vee is in the top 10.

501
00:34:01,072 --> 00:34:02,339
What?

502
00:34:02,341 --> 00:34:04,107
She's in the top 10.

503
00:34:04,109 --> 00:34:05,342
Tommy,
vee is in the top 10?

504
00:34:05,344 --> 00:34:07,411
Yeah, I know.
<i> How is that even possible?</i>

505
00:34:07,413 --> 00:34:08,512
How many watchers
does she have?

506
00:34:08,514 --> 00:34:10,747
Um... like 4,471.

507
00:34:11,616 --> 00:34:12,749
How many do I have?

508
00:34:12,751 --> 00:34:16,553
Uh... 6,806.

509
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:19,356
Oh, okay,
i have a lot more.

510
00:34:19,358 --> 00:34:21,525
<i> Tommy, I really don't think</i>
<i> that vee can handle this.</i>

511
00:34:21,527 --> 00:34:23,126
<i> I'm actually</i>
<i> really worried about her.</i>

512
00:34:23,128 --> 00:34:23,126
Yeah, me, too.

513
00:34:23,128 --> 00:34:26,363
<i> So get your ass to </i>
<i> this party and help me, okay?</i>

514
00:34:26,365 --> 00:34:27,330
Yeah, yeah, I'm on my way.

515
00:35:05,336 --> 00:35:07,170
What happens if I bail?

516
00:35:07,172 --> 00:35:08,305
You'd lose everything
you've already made.

517
00:35:09,507 --> 00:35:11,241
My mom would kill me.

518
00:35:13,344 --> 00:35:14,444
What do you wanna do?

519
00:35:47,445 --> 00:35:49,813
Okay, just please
no fire-breathing dragons
or knives.

520
00:35:49,815 --> 00:35:51,481
No clowns.
Okay.

521
00:35:51,483 --> 00:35:53,350
No snakes, no skeletons.

522
00:35:53,352 --> 00:35:55,519
What about panthers
and tornados?

523
00:35:55,521 --> 00:35:56,853
No!
No?

524
00:35:56,855 --> 00:35:58,555
No!
Okay.

525
00:35:58,557 --> 00:36:00,157
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What about this?

526
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:02,692
Just a tattoo of my dad.

527
00:36:02,694 --> 00:36:05,562
He's gorgeous, honestly.
He's a nice-looking guy.

528
00:36:05,564 --> 00:36:07,230
Ah... okay.
I got a better idea.
Here we go. Here we go.

529
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:11,201
You're gonna draw it? No!

530
00:36:11,203 --> 00:36:13,336
Vee, quiet.
I gotta concentrate!
No! Let me see.

531
00:36:13,338 --> 00:36:14,404
Back off.

532
00:36:15,706 --> 00:36:16,573
'Kay.

533
00:36:18,743 --> 00:36:20,710
Can you do something
like this, but less shitty?

534
00:36:20,712 --> 00:36:21,711
Yes!

535
00:36:21,713 --> 00:36:23,346
Yeah?

536
00:36:23,348 --> 00:36:25,282
Right.
I'm laughing 'cause it's good.

537
00:36:25,284 --> 00:36:26,783
You guys, come on!

538
00:36:26,785 --> 00:36:29,219
Hey, you have to trust us.
That's the whole thing.

539
00:36:29,221 --> 00:36:30,520
Gotta trust me.

540
00:36:30,522 --> 00:36:33,523
And dirt beard.

541
00:36:33,525 --> 00:36:34,724
<i> Ow! Ow! </i>
<i> Okay. Okay.</i>

542
00:36:36,661 --> 00:36:37,661
<i> Okay, you can stop.</i>

543
00:36:41,899 --> 00:36:43,867
<i> I think you can stop.</i>
<i> I think we're good.</i>
<i> We're good.</i>

544
00:36:43,869 --> 00:36:45,769
<i> The dare said it just had</i>
<i> to be bigger than a quarter.</i>

545
00:36:45,771 --> 00:36:48,371
<i> This definitely feels</i>
<i> bigger than a quarter.</i>

546
00:36:48,373 --> 00:36:49,973
You're doin' great.
It's almost done.

547
00:36:49,975 --> 00:36:51,741
Okay, no, I think
wherever we're at,
we can just stop.

548
00:36:51,743 --> 00:36:53,243
Ow, ow, ow...

549
00:36:53,245 --> 00:36:53,944
Hold on, I'm just doing
the "y" in "daddy."

550
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:57,280
What?

551
00:36:57,282 --> 00:36:58,748
He's kidding.
Don't listen to him.

552
00:37:01,819 --> 00:37:03,520
I really don't like
that noise. At all.

553
00:37:15,299 --> 00:37:16,533
Ow!

554
00:37:16,535 --> 00:37:17,601
Oh, my god.

555
00:37:37,822 --> 00:37:39,522
Rockin' that gold tooth.

556
00:37:40,958 --> 00:37:42,826
Stop!

557
00:37:42,828 --> 00:37:43,893
Okay, okay. Ow!

558
00:37:45,796 --> 00:37:48,298
Wu-tang fan, huh?

559
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:49,766
My brother used to listen
to them all the time.

560
00:37:49,768 --> 00:37:50,667
Oh, yeah?
You have a brother?

561
00:37:51,636 --> 00:37:52,802
Had a brother.

562
00:37:54,805 --> 00:37:56,706
He died right before
starting college.

563
00:37:56,708 --> 00:37:59,809
I'm sorry.
How long ago was that?

564
00:37:59,811 --> 00:38:00,644
Two years ago.

565
00:38:01,646 --> 00:38:03,513
He was 18.

566
00:38:04,882 --> 00:38:07,851
This July,
I'll be older than him.

567
00:38:07,853 --> 00:38:09,419
Older than my older brother.

568
00:38:09,421 --> 00:38:10,787
Ow, ow...

569
00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:13,657
Hey, hey. Come on.
Stay with me. Stay with me.

570
00:38:15,693 --> 00:38:17,460
He was just
one of those people that

571
00:38:17,462 --> 00:38:18,795
wasn't afraid of anything.

572
00:38:18,797 --> 00:38:20,964
He always said, "yes."

573
00:38:20,966 --> 00:38:22,866
He would laugh so hard

574
00:38:22,868 --> 00:38:24,367
if he saw me
getting a tattoo right now.

575
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:27,837
Boom! I am done.

576
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:29,806
Go to that mirror.
Celebrate my work.

577
00:38:29,808 --> 00:38:31,341
Come on.

578
00:38:31,343 --> 00:38:33,877
Do I want to see?
Yes, yes, yes.

579
00:38:33,879 --> 00:38:36,313
- Hey.
<i>- 'Sup, young jedi?</i>

580
00:38:36,315 --> 00:38:38,815
Yeah, ha-ha. Hey.
Yo, we miss you
down here at the club.

581
00:38:38,817 --> 00:38:40,650
Um... you're watching
nerve, right?

582
00:38:40,652 --> 00:38:40,650
<i> Yeah, </i>
<i> man, we all are.</i>

583
00:38:40,652 --> 00:38:44,321
All right, I'm trying to find
out more about this Ian guy.

584
00:38:44,323 --> 00:38:44,321
<i> Ian, my dude.</i>

585
00:38:44,323 --> 00:38:47,691
Man, he playin' wit'
your little girlfriend
vee, right?

586
00:38:47,693 --> 00:38:47,691
Could be you,
but you're playin'.

587
00:38:47,693 --> 00:38:50,660
All right, yes.
That's the problem, though.

588
00:38:50,662 --> 00:38:52,062
But I'm looking
at his profile

589
00:38:52,064 --> 00:38:53,830
and there's just
nothing on the guy.

590
00:38:53,832 --> 00:38:56,099
Look, bitch,
you tried Google?

591
00:38:56,101 --> 00:38:57,801
Yeah, I tried Google.

592
00:38:57,803 --> 00:38:58,968
Guess he's a ghost, then.

593
00:39:00,571 --> 00:39:02,939
Look, I need a ticket
to Aruba.

594
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:09,012
- Uh... what? No.
<i>- Yes, come on!</i>

595
00:39:09,014 --> 00:39:09,012
<i> No way. You're not</i>
<i> ready for that shit.</i>

596
00:39:09,014 --> 00:39:11,881
Yes, I know.
<i> You're gonna</i>
<i> mess up my rating.</i>

597
00:39:11,883 --> 00:39:11,881
I'm not gonna
mess up your rating.

598
00:39:11,883 --> 00:39:15,452
I'm not gonna buy guns
or something, man. Come on.

599
00:39:15,454 --> 00:39:17,554
<i> Tommy, no. Not happening.</i>

600
00:39:17,556 --> 00:39:18,955
I'm... look, I'm just worried
about my friend. Please.

601
00:39:20,124 --> 00:39:21,791
<i> Come on.</i>

602
00:39:21,793 --> 00:39:22,992
All right, I'll send you
a passkey.

603
00:39:23,961 --> 00:39:24,861
All right. Thank you.

604
00:39:28,432 --> 00:39:31,668
A lighthouse? I love it.
Thank you.

605
00:39:33,504 --> 00:39:36,406
Well, a very wise person
once said...

606
00:39:36,408 --> 00:39:38,375
And this was earlier today.

607
00:39:39,844 --> 00:39:41,578
They said that
the lighthouse represents

608
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:42,812
the thing that
you want the most.

609
00:39:43,914 --> 00:39:46,616
So, whatever that is,
i hope you get it.

610
00:39:50,755 --> 00:39:52,088
How many followers
does she have now?

611
00:39:54,024 --> 00:39:57,127
I mean, to be fair,
you did tell her
to take a risk.

612
00:39:57,129 --> 00:39:58,661
This isn't
what I meant, Liv.

613
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:02,132
This is ridiculous.

614
00:40:02,134 --> 00:40:03,099
Sydney!

615
00:40:08,473 --> 00:40:13,176
Okay. Now they're asking
if I can trust you. Can I?

616
00:40:13,178 --> 00:40:15,612
I have the perfect tattoo
picked out for you.

617
00:40:15,614 --> 00:40:16,513
Wait, wait, wait.

618
00:40:18,649 --> 00:40:20,550
No, okay,
it's not a tattoo dare.

619
00:40:20,552 --> 00:40:21,851
What is it?

620
00:40:21,853 --> 00:40:24,754
Just says,
"go to park and 25th."

621
00:40:46,844 --> 00:40:47,811
Oh, god,
i love the Internet.

622
00:40:52,683 --> 00:40:54,150
What?

623
00:41:14,905 --> 00:41:15,839
What?

624
00:41:16,841 --> 00:41:18,842
Ian's played before?

625
00:41:18,844 --> 00:41:18,842
<i> Shoot it!</i>

626
00:41:18,844 --> 00:41:21,544
<i> Don't have </i>
<i> to do this.</i>
<i> Just shoot it!</i>

627
00:41:29,688 --> 00:41:30,887
<i> Hey, it's vee.</i>
<i> I'm not here right now,</i>
<i> so leave a message.</i>

628
00:41:33,724 --> 00:41:35,925
Here we go.

629
00:41:35,927 --> 00:41:39,162
Get to 60 miles per hour.
That's it.

630
00:41:39,164 --> 00:41:41,731
Okay.

631
00:41:41,733 --> 00:41:44,267
All right. Easy one.
All right, let's do this.

632
00:41:44,269 --> 00:41:45,134
Oh!

633
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:49,272
What did that just say?

634
00:41:54,945 --> 00:41:57,714
Blindfolded?
On the motorcycle?

635
00:41:57,716 --> 00:41:59,048
Yeah.

636
00:41:59,050 --> 00:42:00,783
You're on your own
with that one.

637
00:42:00,785 --> 00:42:02,852
Wait, wait.
I can't do this alone.

638
00:42:02,854 --> 00:42:04,787
Come on, I need you
to help me navigate.

639
00:42:04,789 --> 00:42:07,757
There is no way in hell
I'm doing that.

640
00:42:07,759 --> 00:42:09,959
I'm sorry, I'm out.

641
00:42:11,262 --> 00:42:14,163
Thank you for tonight.
I mean...

642
00:42:14,165 --> 00:42:18,034
I had a lot of fun.
Got a new dress. But I...

643
00:42:18,802 --> 00:42:19,802
I'm good.

644
00:42:21,171 --> 00:42:23,573
Stay. Let's see
what else happens.

645
00:42:30,147 --> 00:42:33,316
Yo! What's up, guys?
Venus, love your work.

646
00:42:33,318 --> 00:42:34,684
Would you hold that for me?

647
00:42:34,686 --> 00:42:35,585
Hold it up.

648
00:42:37,655 --> 00:42:38,288
Great.

649
00:42:40,991 --> 00:42:42,592
And, Ian,
see you in the finals.

650
00:42:43,928 --> 00:42:46,162
Who was that guy?

651
00:42:46,164 --> 00:42:48,064
I don't know.
Just another player.

652
00:42:52,103 --> 00:42:53,169
Vee, come on,
do this with me.

653
00:42:54,104 --> 00:42:55,338
Please, I need you.

654
00:42:58,676 --> 00:42:59,876
Look, you'd be in control.

655
00:43:02,813 --> 00:43:04,280
Say, "yes."
Just say, "yes."

656
00:43:09,987 --> 00:43:12,889
Ah!

657
00:43:12,891 --> 00:43:15,792
Who got next?
Who wanna challenge
the champ? Liv?

658
00:43:17,696 --> 00:43:19,095
- No way.
- Hey, Liv, come on!

659
00:43:20,898 --> 00:43:21,831
Sydney!

660
00:43:22,733 --> 00:43:24,734
Syd... Sydney!

661
00:43:24,736 --> 00:43:26,336
What?

662
00:43:26,338 --> 00:43:27,170
Oh, my god,
you're not gonna
believe this.

663
00:43:31,976 --> 00:43:34,177
What?
Are you kidding me?

664
00:43:46,223 --> 00:43:47,123
You ready?

665
00:43:48,392 --> 00:43:49,258
Yeah.

666
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:03,706
Chuck,
you seein' this?

667
00:44:06,276 --> 00:44:07,176
All right, remember,
you're my eyes.

668
00:44:11,682 --> 00:44:12,281
Okay.

669
00:44:13,784 --> 00:44:15,251
Green.

670
00:44:15,253 --> 00:44:17,020
Hold on.

671
00:44:20,358 --> 00:44:21,357
You okay?
Yeah.

672
00:44:22,693 --> 00:44:23,960
Just keep your eyes open.

673
00:44:23,962 --> 00:44:23,960
Okay, okay.

674
00:44:23,962 --> 00:44:26,963
Hey, I know you're scared,
but you gotta talk to me, vee.

675
00:44:26,965 --> 00:44:28,097
Okay, wait,
no, no, no!

676
00:44:28,966 --> 00:44:30,400
You got this, vee.

677
00:44:30,402 --> 00:44:32,969
What's goin' on?
Are we good?
Taxi to the right.

678
00:44:32,971 --> 00:44:33,970
Right! Right! No!

679
00:44:33,972 --> 00:44:35,838
You have a sticker
on your helmet!

680
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:38,141
Thank you!
You're leaning right.
You need to go left.

681
00:44:38,143 --> 00:44:39,242
- Left, left!
- Whoa, sorry!

682
00:44:39,244 --> 00:44:41,210
Are you crazy?

683
00:44:41,212 --> 00:44:43,212
- Sorry! Sorry! Sorry!
- We good?

684
00:44:43,214 --> 00:44:44,981
Okay, okay!
Too far left. Right! Right!

685
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:47,784
Okay, okay.

686
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:50,953
Okay,
i think that worked.
Yeah? Are we good?

687
00:44:51,422 --> 00:44:53,823
Actually, yes.

688
00:44:53,825 --> 00:44:54,824
Okay, all right,
just keep doin' that.

689
00:44:54,826 --> 00:44:56,259
Just lean?

690
00:44:56,261 --> 00:44:58,961
Yes, lean.
Left or right.
You are in control.

691
00:44:59,797 --> 00:45:01,064
That's good.

692
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:04,867
No way she's doing this.

693
00:45:04,869 --> 00:45:06,235
<i> Faster.</i>

694
00:45:06,237 --> 00:45:06,969
This is good.
You're doin' great!

695
00:45:07,738 --> 00:45:08,838
Okay, speed up.

696
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:09,472
Yes, ma'am.

697
00:45:18,082 --> 00:45:19,716
Okay.

698
00:45:19,718 --> 00:45:20,817
We hit 30.
We're halfway there.

699
00:45:22,352 --> 00:45:23,853
Okay, the next light is...

700
00:45:24,254 --> 00:45:25,288
Green!

701
00:45:26,824 --> 00:45:28,291
The next light's... green!

702
00:45:28,293 --> 00:45:30,426
Good, good, all right,
you got this.

703
00:45:30,428 --> 00:45:30,426
Okay, the next light is...

704
00:45:33,764 --> 00:45:34,931
Come on, stay with me.
What's goin' on?

705
00:45:36,366 --> 00:45:38,034
Next light is green!
Faster!

706
00:45:38,036 --> 00:45:39,068
No! No, no, no!

707
00:45:47,311 --> 00:45:48,211
Green!

708
00:45:55,853 --> 00:45:56,853
We're doin' this, vee!

709
00:45:57,421 --> 00:45:59,288
Sixty seconds.

710
00:45:59,290 --> 00:46:00,189
- Are we clear now?
- Still clear.

711
00:46:01,825 --> 00:46:03,192
Taxi! Taxi!

712
00:46:07,231 --> 00:46:07,930
Whoa! Whoa!

713
00:46:10,367 --> 00:46:11,167
Oh, god.

714
00:46:17,975 --> 00:46:19,776
Take it home, vee!
Take it home, vee!

715
00:46:19,778 --> 00:46:20,443
Yeah, vee!

716
00:46:22,312 --> 00:46:23,546
Time check.
Fifteen seconds.

717
00:46:25,415 --> 00:46:27,250
Speed?
Forty-five, 46,

718
00:46:27,885 --> 00:46:28,885
47...

719
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:32,054
Ian, we love you!

720
00:46:32,056 --> 00:46:33,489
Love you, too!

721
00:46:33,491 --> 00:46:34,290
All right, let's go!

722
00:46:38,929 --> 00:46:39,996
Fifty-seven,

723
00:46:39,998 --> 00:46:42,198
58, 59,

724
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:43,266
60!

725
00:46:45,269 --> 00:46:47,103
We did it!

726
00:46:47,105 --> 00:46:49,372
Oh, shit!
Look out!

727
00:46:49,374 --> 00:46:50,439
Hold on!
God, oh, my god!
Look out!

728
00:46:54,878 --> 00:46:56,112
Yeah!

729
00:46:57,514 --> 00:47:00,082
Best dare ever!
Vee is number one!

730
00:47:00,084 --> 00:47:01,417
Oh, my god.

731
00:47:05,957 --> 00:47:08,424
That was the craziest thing
I've ever done.
You were incredible.

732
00:47:08,426 --> 00:47:10,126
I can't even believe
we did that.

733
00:47:12,996 --> 00:47:13,930
She kissed him!

734
00:47:15,532 --> 00:47:16,332
Oh, vee!
Get him, girl!

735
00:47:17,367 --> 00:47:18,601
Oh, yeah!

736
00:47:34,585 --> 00:47:35,484
You hungry at all?

737
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:37,920
Pizza?
Pizza...

738
00:47:37,922 --> 00:47:40,256
I swear,
i was gonna say, "pizza."

739
00:47:51,368 --> 00:47:52,869
Hey, watchers.

740
00:47:52,871 --> 00:47:54,437
Okay, listen,

741
00:47:54,439 --> 00:47:56,339
you and I both know
that I should be in that box.

742
00:47:56,341 --> 00:47:59,041
So please,
stop holding back. Okay?

743
00:47:59,043 --> 00:48:01,010
You guys don't need
to be afraid,
because I'm not afraid.

744
00:48:01,012 --> 00:48:02,144
So just give me
a real dare.

745
00:48:07,150 --> 00:48:08,384
What's up, Syd baby?

746
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:10,553
What are you doing here?

747
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:13,656
You're a good player.

748
00:48:17,628 --> 00:48:21,197
You've got a lot of watchers.
I got a lot of watchers.

749
00:48:22,432 --> 00:48:24,267
Maybe we could team up.

750
00:48:27,337 --> 00:48:29,906
I don't need a partner.

751
00:48:29,908 --> 00:48:31,140
Seems to work
for your friend vee.

752
00:48:37,547 --> 00:48:38,948
What up, Syd?
You all right?

753
00:48:40,117 --> 00:48:41,217
Yeah. We're just talking.

754
00:48:44,154 --> 00:48:47,123
Yo, mad Max,
why don't you show
yourself out, man?

755
00:48:59,036 --> 00:49:00,102
Call me.

756
00:49:05,309 --> 00:49:06,142
Break down!

757
00:49:09,546 --> 00:49:10,613
Captain.

758
00:49:14,451 --> 00:49:15,685
Party on, man.

759
00:49:22,259 --> 00:49:24,026
Hey, Nancy.

760
00:49:24,028 --> 00:49:24,026
<i> Tommy, listen, </i>
<i> I have a quick question.</i>

761
00:49:24,028 --> 00:49:27,163
How would I know
if I'm being hacked?

762
00:49:27,165 --> 00:49:28,397
<i> What do you mean?</i>

763
00:49:28,399 --> 00:49:31,067
Hacked. Somebody's been
depositing money

764
00:49:31,069 --> 00:49:32,635
into my account
under vee's name.

765
00:49:32,637 --> 00:49:34,704
That doesn't sound
like a hack.

766
00:49:34,706 --> 00:49:37,239
Normally,
they would take money out

767
00:49:37,241 --> 00:49:39,075
<i> if they were hacking you.</i>

768
00:49:39,077 --> 00:49:41,377
Thomas, what are you
not telling me?

769
00:49:41,379 --> 00:49:44,580
Oh! It must... it might be...
Vee got a job.

770
00:49:44,582 --> 00:49:46,182
<i> What? A job?</i>

771
00:49:46,184 --> 00:49:48,117
Yeah, that's probably it.

772
00:49:48,119 --> 00:49:49,352
<i> She did an online</i>
<i> poker thing.</i>

773
00:49:49,354 --> 00:49:51,187
Okay.

774
00:49:51,189 --> 00:49:53,055
<i> And she's really</i>
<i> great at it.</i>
Is it legal?

775
00:49:53,057 --> 00:49:54,724
<i> Yeah, it's legal.</i>
<i> And she's doing great,</i>

776
00:49:54,726 --> 00:49:57,326
as you can tell
with the deposits.

777
00:49:57,328 --> 00:49:59,095
<i> But anyway, I gotta go.</i>

778
00:49:59,097 --> 00:50:03,399
I'm writing a paper right now
on motorcycle safety.

779
00:50:03,401 --> 00:50:04,633
I'm gonna get goin', but...
<i> Well, tell her to call me.</i>

780
00:50:04,635 --> 00:50:05,601
Bye.
<i> Bye.</i>

781
00:50:11,108 --> 00:50:12,141
Wanna take a ride?

782
00:50:13,043 --> 00:50:14,377
Is this a dare?

783
00:50:14,379 --> 00:50:16,679
Mmm-mmm. It's a carousel.

784
00:50:20,717 --> 00:50:22,318
So, why are you
playing nerve?

785
00:50:24,054 --> 00:50:27,056
Trying to help out
my family.

786
00:50:27,058 --> 00:50:30,593
Some things happened
that I wish
turned out differently.

787
00:50:33,363 --> 00:50:34,296
Like what?

788
00:50:37,468 --> 00:50:40,136
This is just kinda
something I need to do.

789
00:50:40,138 --> 00:50:41,137
So...

790
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:45,708
We got some paparazzi.

791
00:50:46,676 --> 00:50:47,676
Hide.

792
00:50:55,519 --> 00:50:56,285
What? Who is it?

793
00:50:59,790 --> 00:51:01,490
So that's Sydney.

794
00:51:01,492 --> 00:51:02,458
- Pick up, pick up.
<i>- You gonna get it?</i>

795
00:51:04,327 --> 00:51:05,795
<i> I don't wanna deal</i>
<i> with her right now.</i>

796
00:51:05,797 --> 00:51:06,829
Ouch!

797
00:51:08,632 --> 00:51:09,532
What's goin' on?

798
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:13,235
She's just been
a lot recently.

799
00:51:13,237 --> 00:51:13,235
But whatever, you don't
wanna talk about that.

800
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:19,408
If you wanna talk about it,
I'm here. Happy to listen.

801
00:51:24,714 --> 00:51:27,583
I'm just tired of being
her sidekick all the time.

802
00:51:30,153 --> 00:51:32,254
It's funny. You don't
seem like anyone's sidekick.

803
00:51:35,392 --> 00:51:36,392
Can I see that
picture again?

804
00:51:37,561 --> 00:51:38,427
Oh, uh...

805
00:51:40,363 --> 00:51:41,297
Sure.

806
00:51:44,668 --> 00:51:46,168
Wow.

807
00:51:46,170 --> 00:51:49,705
Yeah.
Guys go crazy for her.

808
00:51:49,707 --> 00:51:52,842
No, I mean the picture itself.
It's really good.

809
00:51:55,112 --> 00:51:56,846
Thanks, I took it.

810
00:51:56,848 --> 00:51:59,882
Yeah? You have a good eye.

811
00:51:59,884 --> 00:52:01,784
I just... I can't picture
you hangin' out
with someone like this.

812
00:52:02,619 --> 00:52:04,253
What do you mean?

813
00:52:04,255 --> 00:52:06,722
I don't know.
She looks kind of...

814
00:52:06,724 --> 00:52:09,391
Insecure. Is that mean?

815
00:52:09,393 --> 00:52:11,393
She is totally insecure.
Yeah?

816
00:52:13,263 --> 00:52:14,897
She makes it seem like
I'm the one who's insecure.

817
00:52:14,899 --> 00:52:16,132
But really it's her.

818
00:52:16,134 --> 00:52:17,366
It's exhausting.

819
00:52:17,368 --> 00:52:18,734
I'm sure.

820
00:52:18,736 --> 00:52:20,669
<i> She's at this party.</i>

821
00:52:20,671 --> 00:52:22,838
<i> Most likely drunk and needs me</i>
<i> to hold her hair back.</i>

822
00:52:23,673 --> 00:52:25,674
<i> I'm just over it.</i>

823
00:52:25,676 --> 00:52:26,909
<i> I mean, so are her parents.</i>

824
00:52:26,911 --> 00:52:29,245
<i> They're constantly</i>
<i> out of town,</i>

825
00:52:29,247 --> 00:52:31,213
<i> so she has this</i>
<i> revolving door of guys over.</i>

826
00:52:31,915 --> 00:52:33,382
It's sad, actually.

827
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:47,530
Hey, that party.

828
00:52:49,733 --> 00:52:50,799
Should we maybe
go check it out?

829
00:52:52,369 --> 00:52:53,702
What?

830
00:52:53,704 --> 00:52:55,337
Why would I wanna go
to that party?

831
00:52:56,640 --> 00:53:01,410
Maybe show off
your new tattoo?

832
00:53:01,412 --> 00:53:04,246
Show Sydney that
you're not the person
she thinks you are?

833
00:53:47,791 --> 00:53:49,825
Yo, watch out!
Heads up. Comin' through.

834
00:53:51,728 --> 00:53:52,928
Yo, watch out.

835
00:53:55,265 --> 00:53:56,565
Heads up. Yo!

836
00:54:07,877 --> 00:54:10,446
Okay.
I got this. Okay.

837
00:54:13,283 --> 00:54:14,683
Go, Sydney!

838
00:54:14,685 --> 00:54:15,651
You're
better than this.

839
00:54:15,653 --> 00:54:16,986
Come on, just turn around.

840
00:54:16,988 --> 00:54:16,986
Come on, Syd,
you got this.

841
00:54:16,988 --> 00:54:20,322
Come on, Syd,
you started it,
you gotta finish it.

842
00:54:21,725 --> 00:54:23,025
Come on, you got it.
You got it!

843
00:54:26,496 --> 00:54:27,496
Okay.

844
00:54:29,766 --> 00:54:31,367
Just take
a deep breath.

845
00:54:31,369 --> 00:54:33,435
Just take a deep breath,
Sydney.

846
00:54:33,437 --> 00:54:35,271
Get in here!
She's gonna do it!

847
00:54:35,273 --> 00:54:36,338
Go, girl!

848
00:54:36,340 --> 00:54:37,840
You got this. Okay.

849
00:54:37,842 --> 00:54:39,508
- There you go. Come on.
- Yeah, there you go!

850
00:54:39,510 --> 00:54:40,676
There you go.

851
00:54:40,678 --> 00:54:41,644
Somebody, go get Liv!

852
00:54:41,646 --> 00:54:42,611
Oh, my god.

853
00:54:46,650 --> 00:54:48,317
Come on, Syd.
Focus. You got this.

854
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:49,718
Liv! Liv!

855
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:50,986
Liv, Liv, Liv,
come, come, come.

856
00:54:50,988 --> 00:54:52,021
Excuse me, excuse me.

857
00:54:52,023 --> 00:54:55,658
Oh, my god. Syd!

858
00:54:55,660 --> 00:54:56,759
Be careful.
Be careful, Syd.

859
00:54:56,761 --> 00:54:58,827
What are you doing?
Oh, my god!

860
00:54:58,829 --> 00:55:00,429
Come on, Syd, you don't
have to do this. Come back.

861
00:55:01,998 --> 00:55:03,399
Shut up!

862
00:55:03,401 --> 00:55:04,500
Sydney, come back.

863
00:55:06,670 --> 00:55:08,037
Oh, my god, Sydney!

864
00:55:08,039 --> 00:55:08,404
Yeah! There you go.

865
00:55:12,742 --> 00:55:14,009
Right here. Come on.

866
00:55:15,945 --> 00:55:17,579
You don't have to do it.

867
00:55:17,581 --> 00:55:18,714
Take your time, Syd.
Don't look down.

868
00:55:18,716 --> 00:55:20,349
It's just a stupid game!

869
00:55:20,351 --> 00:55:21,417
Come on,
we're right here.

870
00:55:21,419 --> 00:55:22,718
You could always
turn back, Syd.

871
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:24,920
Jp, grab her.
Come on, you gotta film.

872
00:55:24,922 --> 00:55:25,788
Sydney, it's not gonna
count unless you film it.

873
00:55:26,756 --> 00:55:29,091
Don't worry
about the phone.

874
00:55:29,093 --> 00:55:30,859
She has to film it!
She can't...

875
00:55:30,861 --> 00:55:32,795
It doesn't count
unless she films it.
She has to film it.

876
00:55:32,797 --> 00:55:32,795
Just bail.
Just come back.

877
00:55:32,797 --> 00:55:36,565
She has to film it.
No, but she has to film it.

878
00:55:36,567 --> 00:55:38,667
Shut up, Chuck!
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.

879
00:55:38,669 --> 00:55:40,436
This is crazy.

880
00:55:40,438 --> 00:55:42,638
All right, there you go.
Don't look down.

881
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:44,807
I can't!
Oh, my god, I can't, I can't!

882
00:55:53,083 --> 00:55:54,717
Sydney,
you gotta get up.

883
00:55:54,719 --> 00:55:57,052
You gotta do something.
Stop yelling at me!

884
00:55:57,054 --> 00:55:57,886
- Stop! You're not helping.
- Chuck, shut up!

885
00:55:57,888 --> 00:55:59,121
Shut up, she's got it.

886
00:55:59,123 --> 00:56:00,522
She has to get it done!

887
00:56:00,524 --> 00:56:03,459
Shut up!

888
00:56:03,461 --> 00:56:05,494
Syd, it's gonna take too long,
you gotta stand,
you gotta walk.

889
00:56:05,496 --> 00:56:07,596
No, don't stand, Sydney.

890
00:56:07,598 --> 00:56:10,966
Shut up! Shut up, Chuck!

891
00:56:10,968 --> 00:56:12,000
You heard her, Chuck,
shut up.

892
00:56:14,003 --> 00:56:14,737
She's gotta
get it done.

893
00:56:17,374 --> 00:56:19,975
She's not gonna get here
in time unless
you get up and walk.

894
00:56:19,977 --> 00:56:21,610
You have to walk.

895
00:56:21,612 --> 00:56:21,610
Don't listen to him,
Syd, you got it.

896
00:56:21,612 --> 00:56:23,579
She has to!
She's wasting time!

897
00:56:23,581 --> 00:56:24,947
Shut up, both of you!

898
00:56:31,388 --> 00:56:32,788
You got it.
Come on, Syd, you got this.

899
00:56:44,834 --> 00:56:46,101
I can't,
i can't, I can't.

900
00:56:46,103 --> 00:56:47,803
I bail, I bail, I bail.

901
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:50,706
<i> You bail.</i>

902
00:56:56,146 --> 00:56:57,012
<i> You fail.</i>

903
00:57:02,986 --> 00:57:03,886
<i> You fail.</i>

904
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:08,457
This is so dumb.

905
00:57:10,427 --> 00:57:11,527
Come here! Hold on!

906
00:57:11,529 --> 00:57:12,561
<i> You fail.</i>

907
00:57:12,563 --> 00:57:13,128
Get over here!

908
00:57:47,730 --> 00:57:48,831
Oh, my god.

909
00:58:53,029 --> 00:58:54,296
Oh! Look at these guys!

910
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:17,920
Vee!

911
00:59:19,889 --> 00:59:21,323
- Hi.
- Hi!

912
00:59:21,325 --> 00:59:24,860
Oh, my gosh. You guys
are so famous right now.

913
00:59:24,862 --> 00:59:26,728
Uh-oh!
Wait until Syd sees you.

914
00:59:26,730 --> 00:59:27,930
But where is she?

915
00:59:27,932 --> 00:59:29,064
Oh, you guys don't know?

916
00:59:30,867 --> 00:59:33,902
Yeah, she tried to walk across
that ladder and just bailed.

917
00:59:33,904 --> 00:59:35,037
So she's outta the game?

918
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:36,104
Hey, let's get a drink.

919
00:59:36,106 --> 00:59:37,272
Yeah. It wasn't pretty.

920
00:59:44,147 --> 00:59:45,581
Have you seen Sydney?

921
00:59:45,583 --> 00:59:46,748
In there.
Syd?

922
00:59:54,958 --> 00:59:56,725
Oh, come on, vee,
you never even spoke to him.

923
00:59:59,195 --> 01:00:01,129
It's fine.
Certainly, no surprise.

924
01:00:04,667 --> 01:00:06,902
Yeah, I know
it's not a surprise.

925
01:00:06,904 --> 01:00:08,971
You know
what's not fine, though?

926
01:00:08,973 --> 01:00:12,307
I almost died tonight, vee,
and you were
nowhere to be found.

927
01:00:12,309 --> 01:00:14,076
I'm sorry.

928
01:00:14,078 --> 01:00:15,811
When you said
i should live my life,

929
01:00:15,813 --> 01:00:17,779
did you mean I should
live my life in your shadow?

930
01:00:17,781 --> 01:00:19,181
I was just trying
to help you, vee,

931
01:00:19,183 --> 01:00:21,049
because you're the most
repressed person that I know.

932
01:00:22,719 --> 01:00:24,319
Well, isn't that why
you keep me around?

933
01:00:24,321 --> 01:00:25,654
Because I never
tell you the truth?

934
01:00:26,022 --> 01:00:27,222
Yeah.

935
01:00:27,224 --> 01:00:28,690
Come on, let's go.

936
01:00:28,692 --> 01:00:29,391
I guess you don't
tell me the truth.

937
01:00:31,060 --> 01:00:34,663
Because you never told me
about how insecure I am.

938
01:00:34,665 --> 01:00:38,700
Or about how I just have
a revolving door
of guys all the time.

939
01:00:38,702 --> 01:00:41,737
You never tell me that,
but you've told
everyone that tonight.

940
01:00:41,739 --> 01:00:44,906
So please, vee,
go right ahead
and show us all

941
01:00:44,908 --> 01:00:47,142
what a fiery little spark plug
you've become since lunch.

942
01:00:48,111 --> 01:00:49,277
Let's go.

943
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:51,380
Shots fired.

944
01:00:51,382 --> 01:00:54,316
Don't walk away from me.
Vee! Wake up!

945
01:00:54,318 --> 01:00:56,018
This is a game.

946
01:00:56,020 --> 01:00:57,653
Do you really think that
someone like him

947
01:00:57,655 --> 01:00:58,854
is actually gonna be with you
when this is all done?

948
01:00:58,856 --> 01:01:00,322
Hey, you don't know me.

949
01:01:00,324 --> 01:01:01,423
Oh, I'm sorry.
You really like her now?

950
01:01:01,425 --> 01:01:03,025
Yeah, I do.

951
01:01:03,027 --> 01:01:04,226
All right, come on, Syd,
you're just drunk.

952
01:01:04,228 --> 01:01:06,795
Tommy, it is time
to get over her!

953
01:01:06,797 --> 01:01:07,896
Clearly, she has traded up!

954
01:01:09,232 --> 01:01:11,133
Why do you have to be
such a bitch?

955
01:01:11,135 --> 01:01:13,235
Look at that!

956
01:01:13,237 --> 01:01:15,937
Little vee finally
speaking her mind.

957
01:01:15,939 --> 01:01:18,674
Come on!
Unburden yourself!

958
01:01:18,676 --> 01:01:20,909
Do you know why
we're best friends?

959
01:01:20,911 --> 01:01:23,679
I do whatever
you want all the time.

960
01:01:23,681 --> 01:01:27,015
No, vee, we're friends

961
01:01:27,017 --> 01:01:31,119
because I'm fun
and you're boring.

962
01:01:31,121 --> 01:01:33,288
The only fun thing about you
was your brother.

963
01:01:36,092 --> 01:01:37,426
What is it you think?

964
01:01:37,428 --> 01:01:38,727
That playing nerve
is just gonna

965
01:01:38,729 --> 01:01:40,829
magically make you
a different person?

966
01:01:40,831 --> 01:01:43,832
That's not how life works.
You'll never be a player.

967
01:01:43,834 --> 01:01:44,900
You're right.

968
01:01:46,335 --> 01:01:48,737
I know how much you love
living in the moment, Syd.

969
01:01:48,739 --> 01:01:50,839
Well, remember this moment.

970
01:01:50,841 --> 01:01:54,109
Because you're
one of those girls
who peaks in high school.

971
01:01:54,111 --> 01:01:56,812
And when you wake up one day,
still living in staten island,

972
01:01:56,814 --> 01:01:58,413
still screwing the same guys,

973
01:01:58,415 --> 01:02:00,816
wondering what the hell
happened to your life.

974
01:02:00,818 --> 01:02:02,984
If you wanna know
where I am from now on,

975
01:02:02,986 --> 01:02:04,186
sign up and watch me.

976
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:12,194
Wait, vee,
what are you doing?

977
01:02:15,331 --> 01:02:17,933
Hey, vee,
you don't need to do this.

978
01:02:17,935 --> 01:02:19,334
Look at me. Come on.
Let's just go,
let's bail, all right?

979
01:02:19,336 --> 01:02:20,802
What do you have to prove?

980
01:02:20,804 --> 01:02:21,937
Come on, please. Let's go.

981
01:02:26,175 --> 01:02:28,410
Come on, you got it,
vee, please!

982
01:02:28,412 --> 01:02:29,244
- Go, girl!
- Vee!

983
01:02:36,052 --> 01:02:38,019
Oh, my god. Vee!

984
01:02:38,021 --> 01:02:38,019
Whoa!

985
01:02:40,289 --> 01:02:41,156
You got it, vee!

986
01:03:14,991 --> 01:03:15,957
That's how you get
into first, vee!

987
01:03:19,429 --> 01:03:20,962
That was messed up.

988
01:03:20,964 --> 01:03:22,998
I can't deal with this
right now. I'm gonna go.

989
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:24,266
Vee, did you know
that he's played
nerve before?

990
01:03:24,268 --> 01:03:25,934
What?

991
01:03:25,936 --> 01:03:26,835
Yeah, it was his dare
to get you here

992
01:03:26,837 --> 01:03:28,170
and fight with Syd.

993
01:03:28,172 --> 01:03:29,004
That's why
he brought you here.

994
01:03:29,872 --> 01:03:30,539
Look.

995
01:03:33,109 --> 01:03:34,109
You still trust him?

996
01:03:41,384 --> 01:03:43,919
Vee, wait. Wait.
Is it true?

997
01:03:43,921 --> 01:03:45,887
Is what true?

998
01:03:45,889 --> 01:03:47,155
Did you take me here
as part of the game?

999
01:03:49,892 --> 01:03:51,026
Answer me! Is it true?

1000
01:03:56,999 --> 01:03:59,100
What are you doing?

1001
01:03:59,102 --> 01:04:01,036
It's more complicated
than that.

1002
01:04:01,038 --> 01:04:03,104
I just lost my two
best friends tonight.

1003
01:04:03,106 --> 01:04:04,539
How much did you
get for that?

1004
01:04:04,541 --> 01:04:06,141
No, no, it's not
about the money, all right?

1005
01:04:06,143 --> 01:04:07,542
But I promise
I'll explain everything later.

1006
01:04:07,544 --> 01:04:08,944
Just don't even
bother, okay?

1007
01:04:08,946 --> 01:04:10,512
I mean,
Sydney almost died tonight.

1008
01:04:10,514 --> 01:04:13,448
I almost died tonight.
Vee, I know, I know.

1009
01:04:13,450 --> 01:04:15,250
This game is sick.
I'm going to the police.

1010
01:04:15,252 --> 01:04:16,518
Wait, no, no! No!

1011
01:04:18,187 --> 01:04:19,554
I'm sorry, vee...
What are you doing?

1012
01:04:19,556 --> 01:04:21,022
I'm sorry,
you can't do that,
all right?

1013
01:04:21,024 --> 01:04:22,257
You can't go to the police.

1014
01:04:22,259 --> 01:04:24,125
Why not?
Because I'll lose the game?

1015
01:04:24,127 --> 01:04:25,393
No, it's not about that!

1016
01:04:26,229 --> 01:04:27,162
Vee! Vee!

1017
01:04:28,431 --> 01:04:29,931
You can't go to the police.

1018
01:04:29,933 --> 01:04:31,600
It's the last thing
you wanna do.

1019
01:04:31,602 --> 01:04:33,401
Vee, wait, I wasn't
trying to hurt you.

1020
01:04:33,403 --> 01:04:35,036
It just got outta control.

1021
01:04:35,038 --> 01:04:37,072
Move! Get out of the way!

1022
01:04:38,307 --> 01:04:39,341
Officer!

1023
01:04:42,078 --> 01:04:43,478
Officer!

1024
01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:45,413
Officer, I need help. I'm...

1025
01:04:45,415 --> 01:04:48,316
I'm playing this game.
It's called nerve.

1026
01:04:48,318 --> 01:04:49,551
<i> And I'm worried that someone's</i>
<i> gonna get really hurt.</i>

1027
01:04:49,553 --> 01:04:50,652
Uh-oh.

1028
01:04:50,654 --> 01:04:51,887
Snitch!

1029
01:04:53,222 --> 01:04:55,957
A game? They playin', too?

1030
01:04:55,959 --> 01:04:56,892
Yeah, yeah.

1031
01:04:59,028 --> 01:05:00,228
There's a crime
being committed?

1032
01:05:02,064 --> 01:05:05,400
No, but a kid
could die tonight.

1033
01:05:05,402 --> 01:05:07,168
Look, here, it's all
on my phone. You can see.

1034
01:05:13,342 --> 01:05:14,342
What?

1035
01:05:14,911 --> 01:05:15,911
What?

1036
01:05:19,148 --> 01:05:20,916
Snitch!

1037
01:05:20,918 --> 01:05:22,384
Snitches get stitches!

1038
01:05:29,092 --> 01:05:30,358
Mom?

1039
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:31,459
<i> Honey, </i>
<i> what's going on?</i>

1040
01:05:31,461 --> 01:05:32,994
Mom!

1041
01:05:32,996 --> 01:05:36,031
<i> Vee, where are you?</i>

1042
01:05:36,033 --> 01:05:38,333
All the money is missing
from our account!

1043
01:05:38,335 --> 01:05:39,634
Wait, what?

1044
01:05:39,636 --> 01:05:41,937
Vee, honey,
are you in trouble?

1045
01:05:41,939 --> 01:05:44,272
<i> Can you just, please,</i>
<i> tell me what's going on?</i>

1046
01:05:44,274 --> 01:05:45,573
Okay, mom, I'm gonna fix this,
i promise.

1047
01:05:47,376 --> 01:05:48,209
<i> Fix what?</i>

1048
01:05:49,111 --> 01:05:51,980
Hello? Vee!

1049
01:05:51,982 --> 01:05:54,582
<i> Hello? Vee! Fix what?</i>
I'm sorry,

1050
01:05:54,584 --> 01:05:55,283
but I gotta win this game.

1051
01:06:55,311 --> 01:06:57,178
<i> Hello, vee.</i>

1052
01:06:57,180 --> 01:07:00,648
<i> You broke the rules.</i>
<i> You are our prisoner.</i>

1053
01:07:00,650 --> 01:07:02,484
<i> We told you not to snitch.</i>

1054
01:07:03,786 --> 01:07:05,754
<i> Now we control your life.</i>

1055
01:07:07,023 --> 01:07:09,324
<i> We control your family.</i>

1056
01:07:09,326 --> 01:07:11,092
<i> We control your future.</i>

1057
01:07:12,728 --> 01:07:14,629
<i> The only way out</i>
<i> is to win the final round.</i>

1058
01:07:16,432 --> 01:07:18,166
<i> Go to the staten island ferry</i>

1059
01:07:18,168 --> 01:07:20,201
<i> and the watchers</i>
<i> will find you.</i>

1060
01:07:20,203 --> 01:07:22,037
<i> See you in the finals.</i>

1061
01:07:22,039 --> 01:07:23,605
<i> See you in the finals.</i>
<i> See you in the finals.</i>

1062
01:08:09,318 --> 01:08:10,285
Checkin' over here.

1063
01:08:12,188 --> 01:08:13,088
I'm comin' for you, vee!

1064
01:08:23,199 --> 01:08:24,799
Vee, thank god!
Are you okay?

1065
01:08:24,801 --> 01:08:27,669
Am I okay?
No, I'm not okay!

1066
01:08:27,671 --> 01:08:29,170
You need to tell me
everything.

1067
01:08:29,172 --> 01:08:30,672
Okay, what the hell
is going on?

1068
01:08:30,674 --> 01:08:31,840
Come here, come here.
Why is this happening to me?

1069
01:08:33,642 --> 01:08:35,844
'Kay, that guy Ty.

1070
01:08:35,846 --> 01:08:38,713
We both played nerve
last year in Seattle.

1071
01:08:38,715 --> 01:08:41,449
We got a dare to hang
from a construction crane
200 feet in the air.

1072
01:08:41,451 --> 01:08:44,619
The two of us
and this kid named Robbie.

1073
01:08:44,621 --> 01:08:46,754
Five!
Four! Three!

1074
01:08:46,756 --> 01:08:48,389
Come on, Robbie,
that's enough.
Shit, he's slipping.

1075
01:08:48,391 --> 01:08:49,724
- Two! One!
- Climb back up, man.

1076
01:08:49,726 --> 01:08:50,625
- Ian, grab him.
- Grab my hand!

1077
01:08:53,163 --> 01:08:56,364
Ty and I, we bailed
and we went to the cops.

1078
01:08:56,366 --> 01:08:57,832
We tried to get
the game shut down,

1079
01:08:57,834 --> 01:08:59,334
but they didn't do anything.

1080
01:08:59,336 --> 01:09:01,636
No, they just
called it an accident.

1081
01:09:02,906 --> 01:09:05,206
Then the watchers, they...

1082
01:09:05,208 --> 01:09:06,841
They came after us
for snitching.

1083
01:09:06,843 --> 01:09:08,776
They messed
with my dad's job.

1084
01:09:08,778 --> 01:09:10,645
They leaked photos
of my sister online.

1085
01:09:10,647 --> 01:09:12,347
They stole
our identities, vee.

1086
01:09:13,816 --> 01:09:16,751
Me and Ty, we became
prisoners of the game.

1087
01:09:16,753 --> 01:09:18,419
Oh, come on.
What does that even mean?

1088
01:09:18,421 --> 01:09:20,221
It's the third category.

1089
01:09:20,890 --> 01:09:22,891
Watcher, player, prisoner.

1090
01:09:24,593 --> 01:09:25,760
I'm trapped.

1091
01:09:26,862 --> 01:09:28,363
The only way out is to win.

1092
01:09:32,601 --> 01:09:33,601
So you have to win.

1093
01:09:34,837 --> 01:09:37,839
No. No, you do.

1094
01:09:37,841 --> 01:09:39,240
What?

1095
01:09:39,242 --> 01:09:40,441
Vee, you're a prisoner now.

1096
01:09:42,444 --> 01:09:44,312
You and I, we're going
to the final round together

1097
01:09:44,314 --> 01:09:45,413
and I'm gonna lose.

1098
01:09:45,415 --> 01:09:46,881
What? No, you can't do that.

1099
01:09:46,883 --> 01:09:48,483
It's already done.
It's already done.

1100
01:09:48,485 --> 01:09:50,251
I told the watchers
to give me a dare

1101
01:09:50,253 --> 01:09:51,786
that's gonna knock Ty
outta second place.

1102
01:09:51,788 --> 01:09:53,421
It's gonna be me and you.

1103
01:09:57,927 --> 01:09:59,928
I have to go.
No, no, no.

1104
01:09:59,930 --> 01:10:01,229
Yeah, I wanna take you
somewhere safe. Let's go!

1105
01:10:01,231 --> 01:10:02,630
There has to be
another way.

1106
01:10:02,632 --> 01:10:03,665
There isn't.

1107
01:10:05,701 --> 01:10:07,702
If it's not me in the finals,
then it's Ty.

1108
01:10:07,704 --> 01:10:09,404
And he'll do anything
to win.

1109
01:10:11,941 --> 01:10:14,209
Just tell me
we're gonna do this.

1110
01:10:36,398 --> 01:10:37,265
Hey...

1111
01:10:37,933 --> 01:10:38,967
It's not your fault.

1112
01:10:41,470 --> 01:10:43,404
I just hope she's okay.

1113
01:10:48,010 --> 01:10:49,744
- Hello?
<i>- Guys, it's me.</i>

1114
01:10:49,746 --> 01:10:51,512
Oh, my god!
Vee, where are you?

1115
01:11:22,344 --> 01:11:23,945
I'm so sorry.

1116
01:11:23,947 --> 01:11:25,580
Doesn't matter.
I'm just glad you're okay.

1117
01:11:25,582 --> 01:11:26,881
All right, come on.
Let's go.
I can't.

1118
01:11:26,883 --> 01:11:27,749
What?

1119
01:11:28,817 --> 01:11:30,385
I have to finish this.

1120
01:11:30,387 --> 01:11:31,753
Are you insane?

1121
01:11:31,755 --> 01:11:33,655
What are you talking about?

1122
01:11:33,657 --> 01:11:35,590
Look, it's never gonna end.

1123
01:11:35,592 --> 01:11:35,590
I mean, even if
they leave me alone,

1124
01:11:35,592 --> 01:11:35,590
they're just gonna
do it to somebody else.

1125
01:11:35,592 --> 01:11:40,728
We can't stop the game
if we wanted to.
There's no one to stop.

1126
01:11:40,730 --> 01:11:41,963
It's just a bunch
of anonymous people.

1127
01:11:44,733 --> 01:11:45,967
What if they
weren't anonymous?

1128
01:11:50,005 --> 01:11:50,004
<i> Ian's doing a dare that </i>
<i> would put him in the finals.</i>

1129
01:11:50,006 --> 01:11:53,007
<i> So it could be</i>
<i> me against him.</i>

1130
01:11:53,009 --> 01:11:54,542
<i> Vee, do you actually </i>
<i> trust this guy?</i>

1131
01:11:54,544 --> 01:11:55,576
He is the person
who got you

1132
01:11:55,578 --> 01:11:56,711
into this mess
in the first place.

1133
01:12:03,319 --> 01:12:05,353
I got me into this mess.

1134
01:12:05,355 --> 01:12:06,721
Anything Ian's doing now
is to help me get out.

1135
01:12:18,367 --> 01:12:20,702
I know it sounds crazy,
but I can do it.

1136
01:12:20,704 --> 01:12:21,502
I just need your help.

1137
01:12:24,540 --> 01:12:25,673
What do you need us to do?

1138
01:12:27,509 --> 01:12:29,911
Tommy, you said the game
is open source, right?

1139
01:12:29,913 --> 01:12:31,479
<i> Do you think you can</i>
<i> change the code?</i>

1140
01:12:31,481 --> 01:12:33,614
<i> It's gonna take time.</i>

1141
01:12:33,616 --> 01:12:34,749
<i> Syd, could you </i>
<i> buy us some?</i>

1142
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:40,755
Hey. Now climb the crane.

1143
01:12:45,027 --> 01:12:45,893
Syd?

1144
01:12:46,628 --> 01:12:47,562
Yeah?

1145
01:12:48,097 --> 01:12:49,097
Use a payphone.

1146
01:13:29,772 --> 01:13:32,073
Ah!

1147
01:13:32,075 --> 01:13:33,408
<i> Hang for five seconds.</i>

1148
01:13:35,110 --> 01:13:36,677
<i> Hang for five seconds.</i>

1149
01:13:52,528 --> 01:13:54,996
<i> Hang with one hand.</i>
<i> Hang with one hand.</i>

1150
01:13:54,998 --> 01:13:55,897
Shit!

1151
01:14:14,149 --> 01:14:17,852
One! Two! Three!

1152
01:14:18,654 --> 01:14:19,854
Four!

1153
01:14:19,856 --> 01:14:20,755
Five!

1154
01:14:48,550 --> 01:14:50,485
<i>- Yeah, it's over here, Tommy.</i>
<i>- We don't have a lot of time.</i>

1155
01:14:50,487 --> 01:14:51,686
Okay, yeah. We're on our way.
We'll see you soon.

1156
01:14:51,688 --> 01:14:52,887
How did it go?

1157
01:14:52,889 --> 01:14:54,055
It went.

1158
01:14:54,057 --> 01:14:54,889
It went?

1159
01:14:56,525 --> 01:14:58,559
Yeah. I think
it's gonna work.

1160
01:14:58,561 --> 01:14:59,727
Yeah, better work.

1161
01:14:59,729 --> 01:15:00,561
I mean, god.

1162
01:15:40,002 --> 01:15:41,936
What is this place?

1163
01:15:41,938 --> 01:15:43,704
Fastest Internet
in New York City.

1164
01:15:46,575 --> 01:15:47,909
Hey, Tommy!

1165
01:15:47,911 --> 01:15:47,909
Hey, hk, we made it.

1166
01:15:47,911 --> 01:15:47,909
Let's get
this started. You ready?

1167
01:15:47,911 --> 01:15:51,178
Is the botnet
up and running?
Yeah, of course.

1168
01:15:52,748 --> 01:15:54,315
We just gotta enter it
into the system.

1169
01:15:54,317 --> 01:15:57,685
Oh, and this is Sydney.
Obviously.

1170
01:15:57,687 --> 01:15:59,086
Hey.
Hey.
Welcome to the cloud.

1171
01:15:59,088 --> 01:16:00,888
Sucks you got axed.

1172
01:16:00,890 --> 01:16:03,591
All right.
Let's take this game down.

1173
01:16:57,813 --> 01:16:59,780
I got you. Yeah.

1174
01:17:21,269 --> 01:17:23,237
Okay,
how's this gonna work?

1175
01:17:23,239 --> 01:17:25,706
It's like Wikipedia,
where anyone
can edit the code

1176
01:17:25,708 --> 01:17:27,375
but the majority
has to approve it.

1177
01:17:27,377 --> 01:17:30,111
And then the botnet
can outvote everyone.

1178
01:17:30,113 --> 01:17:31,979
Yo, I got a army of bots here
waitin' for orders.

1179
01:17:36,652 --> 01:17:38,285
Hey, Nancy.
<i> Where is vee? </i>
<i> What is this game?</i>

1180
01:17:38,287 --> 01:17:39,253
<i> Don't worry, </i>
<i> she's okay.</i>

1181
01:17:39,255 --> 01:17:40,755
I want you
to explain it to me.

1182
01:17:40,757 --> 01:17:42,289
I'm gonna give
you an address.

1183
01:17:42,291 --> 01:17:43,824
Okay, if you meet me here,
I'll explain everything.

1184
01:18:26,968 --> 01:18:27,968
Ticket?

1185
01:18:40,849 --> 01:18:42,049
Better hurry up.

1186
01:18:44,052 --> 01:18:46,253
Guys, it's starting!

1187
01:19:08,844 --> 01:19:11,378
Vee! Vee! Vee! Vee!

1188
01:19:36,304 --> 01:19:37,238
<i> Players, stop!</i>

1189
01:19:38,073 --> 01:19:38,973
<i> Back up.</i>

1190
01:19:45,914 --> 01:19:47,548
<i> Stop.</i>

1191
01:19:47,550 --> 01:19:49,350
All right, how many bots
do we got in?

1192
01:19:49,352 --> 01:19:51,886
Not enough yet,
but we are getting there.

1193
01:20:02,097 --> 01:20:04,265
<i> Players, </i>
<i> show us your weapons.</i>

1194
01:20:16,545 --> 01:20:17,511
<i> First to shoot wins.</i>

1195
01:20:21,483 --> 01:20:23,350
<i> Twenty seconds</i>
<i> on the clock.</i>

1196
01:20:25,187 --> 01:20:28,222
Twenty seconds?
Hk, I need backup!

1197
01:20:28,224 --> 01:20:29,456
<i> Begin.</i>
Do it.

1198
01:20:31,226 --> 01:20:32,493
<i> Start by just</i>
<i> raising your gun.</i>

1199
01:20:32,495 --> 01:20:34,361
<i> Just raise</i>
<i> your gun slowly.</i>

1200
01:20:34,363 --> 01:20:34,361
Then shoot me
in the shoulder.
I'll be fine.

1201
01:20:34,363 --> 01:20:38,032
What if I miss?
I don't know
if I can do this.

1202
01:20:38,034 --> 01:20:38,299
Oh, come on! Just shut up
and play the game!

1203
01:20:42,971 --> 01:20:44,171
Vee, you have to hurry,
all right?

1204
01:20:46,608 --> 01:20:48,976
You have to do this!
This is the only way
the game can end.

1205
01:20:48,978 --> 01:20:50,010
And then
you can walk away.

1206
01:20:56,017 --> 01:20:56,584
<i> Five,</i>

1207
01:20:57,619 --> 01:20:58,586
<i> four,</i>

1208
01:20:59,387 --> 01:21:00,321
<i> three,</i>

1209
01:21:01,189 --> 01:21:02,590
<i> two, one!</i>

1210
01:21:04,327 --> 01:21:06,627
Boo!

1211
01:21:06,629 --> 01:21:07,895
I'm not doing this.

1212
01:21:07,897 --> 01:21:08,462
Vee, don't, you can't...

1213
01:21:13,535 --> 01:21:15,135
I'll do it!

1214
01:21:19,876 --> 01:21:21,275
Oh, shit.
They're onto us.

1215
01:21:21,277 --> 01:21:23,210
They're blockin'
all of our foreign ips!

1216
01:21:23,212 --> 01:21:23,944
Tommy, do something!

1217
01:21:30,385 --> 01:21:31,418
Did y'all miss me?

1218
01:21:34,923 --> 01:21:37,424
And I say
we do that dare again.

1219
01:21:37,426 --> 01:21:38,559
<i> With someone</i>
<i> who's really ready to play.</i>

1220
01:21:38,561 --> 01:21:40,361
Yeah!

1221
01:21:40,363 --> 01:21:41,295
Don't do it, Ty,
it's not worth it, man.

1222
01:21:43,498 --> 01:21:44,899
Stop!
Whoa, whoa, back up!

1223
01:21:44,901 --> 01:21:46,433
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1224
01:21:46,435 --> 01:21:48,068
You have lost
your mind, pretty boy!

1225
01:21:48,070 --> 01:21:48,969
Get back!
Is this what
you really want?

1226
01:21:48,971 --> 01:21:50,571
For us to kill each other?

1227
01:21:50,573 --> 01:21:52,139
Yeah!
Of course
it's what you want!

1228
01:21:52,674 --> 01:21:53,607
Kill 'em!

1229
01:21:54,542 --> 01:21:56,577
You think that takes nerve?

1230
01:21:56,579 --> 01:21:58,345
Why don't you
take off your masks

1231
01:21:58,347 --> 01:22:00,414
and show yourselves, huh?

1232
01:22:00,416 --> 01:22:02,383
You, take off your mask.

1233
01:22:02,385 --> 01:22:03,651
Yeah, what's your name?

1234
01:22:07,589 --> 01:22:10,557
<i> It's easy for you</i>
<i> to be brave in a crowd!</i>

1235
01:22:10,559 --> 01:22:13,560
<i> Hiding behind</i>
<i> your screen names.</i>

1236
01:22:13,562 --> 01:22:15,429
Don't you guys see that
you're all still responsible

1237
01:22:15,431 --> 01:22:17,131
for what happens tonight,

1238
01:22:17,133 --> 01:22:19,533
even if you are
just watching?

1239
01:22:19,535 --> 01:22:21,335
Oh, my god! Are you really
believing this bullshit?

1240
01:22:22,003 --> 01:22:23,003
Play to win!

1241
01:22:24,039 --> 01:22:25,673
Play to win.

1242
01:22:27,475 --> 01:22:30,711
You guys really
want one of us to die?
For a game?

1243
01:22:30,713 --> 01:22:31,679
Yes!

1244
01:22:32,380 --> 01:22:33,347
Yes!

1245
01:22:35,951 --> 01:22:36,717
Then shoot me.

1246
01:22:39,421 --> 01:22:40,554
I dare you.

1247
01:22:43,058 --> 01:22:44,158
Okay.

1248
01:22:45,327 --> 01:22:47,261
Who wants me to shoot her?

1249
01:22:47,263 --> 01:22:49,029
Vee, what are you doing?

1250
01:22:49,031 --> 01:22:51,065
Who wants me to shoot her?

1251
01:22:52,033 --> 01:22:53,600
Tommy, where's vee?

1252
01:22:53,602 --> 01:22:53,600
- All right, calm down.
- What is this game?

1253
01:22:53,602 --> 01:22:57,338
I want answers!
What are you doing?

1254
01:22:57,340 --> 01:22:59,606
You better tell me right now
or I'm calling the cops.

1255
01:22:59,608 --> 01:23:00,975
No! No,
Nancy, calm down.
No cops.

1256
01:23:00,977 --> 01:23:02,743
Do you want me
to shoot her?

1257
01:23:02,745 --> 01:23:03,510
Shoot to kill!
Then vote "yes."

1258
01:23:03,512 --> 01:23:05,279
Shoot to kill!

1259
01:23:05,281 --> 01:23:08,182
Vote "yes" if you want me
to shoot her!

1260
01:23:08,184 --> 01:23:10,484
Don't listen to him!
Say, "no!"

1261
01:23:10,486 --> 01:23:12,653
You want me to shoot her?
You want me to shoot her?

1262
01:23:14,724 --> 01:23:15,990
Come on, guys, "no"!

1263
01:23:18,293 --> 01:23:19,293
Guys, vote "no"!

1264
01:23:21,296 --> 01:23:24,131
You! Vote "yes"!
Vote "yes"!

1265

Let me know!
Vote "yes"!

1266
01:23:44,786 --> 01:23:46,220
Don't listen to him!
Say, "no!"

1267
01:23:48,089 --> 01:23:50,424
Come on! Let's have
a little bit of anarchy.

1268
01:23:52,227 --> 01:23:54,094
All right, we're getting
around them.

1269
01:23:54,096 --> 01:23:55,696
The ips are coming in
faster now.

1270
01:23:55,698 --> 01:23:57,164
Vee, we need to go,
right now!

1271
01:23:57,166 --> 01:23:58,432
Oh, my god!

1272
01:23:58,434 --> 01:23:59,333
Okay, all right.
Come on, guys. Keep going.

1273
01:24:08,411 --> 01:24:09,309
Oh, my god!
No, no, no, it's...

1274
01:24:18,253 --> 01:24:19,620
Vee, please!
Please, please!

1275
01:24:20,488 --> 01:24:23,690
No. No, no, no.

1276
01:24:23,692 --> 01:24:25,325
Do you hear me, vee?
Look at me, vee, please!

1277
01:24:28,396 --> 01:24:29,229
Go.

1278
01:24:47,148 --> 01:24:47,781
Dude,
are you getting this?

1279
01:24:49,250 --> 01:24:50,317
That's my real name.

1280
01:25:44,439 --> 01:25:45,639
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

1281
01:25:45,641 --> 01:25:46,673
<i> No, wait, stop, stop!</i>

1282
01:25:46,675 --> 01:25:48,375
My god!

1283
01:25:48,377 --> 01:25:50,310
<i> It's okay, </i>
<i> it's okay!</i>

1284
01:25:50,312 --> 01:25:52,546
Stop! It's okay.
I'm okay. It's okay.

1285
01:25:53,681 --> 01:25:55,215
Oh, my god!

1286
01:25:55,783 --> 01:25:56,650
Sorry.

1287
01:25:59,921 --> 01:26:02,556
You were in on this?

1288
01:26:02,558 --> 01:26:04,791
It was her plan, man.
Her friend Sydney called me.

1289
01:26:04,793 --> 01:26:06,293
That's why I'm here.

1290
01:26:06,295 --> 01:26:07,861
The gun... what?

1291
01:26:07,863 --> 01:26:08,695
Blanks, bro.

1292
01:26:14,469 --> 01:26:15,936
It's fake.

1293
01:26:15,938 --> 01:26:17,237
Oh, my god!

1294
01:26:17,906 --> 01:26:18,805
Oh, my god.

1295
01:26:22,944 --> 01:26:24,311
You scared me.

1296
01:26:24,313 --> 01:26:25,345
You scared me.

1297
01:26:27,215 --> 01:26:27,915
We cool?

1298
01:26:29,450 --> 01:26:31,618
Yeah. We're free.

1299
01:26:32,420 --> 01:26:33,520
She's a badass.

1300
01:26:34,455 --> 01:26:35,422
Watch out for her.

1301
01:26:38,526 --> 01:26:39,426
<i> That's it. </i>
<i> The last player's out.</i>

1302
01:26:39,428 --> 01:26:39,426
<i> Did we get it?</i>

1303
01:26:39,428 --> 01:26:39,426
<i> They're out. </i>
<i> Think it's crashing!</i>

1304
01:26:39,428 --> 01:26:43,964
We got it?
And nerve
is officially offline!

1305
01:26:45,466 --> 01:26:48,602
Wow! We have
gamed the game.
Whoo!

1306
01:26:48,604 --> 01:26:51,271
You guys are the dumbest
smart kids I've ever met.

1307
01:26:52,774 --> 01:26:53,907
I'm so sorry.

1308
01:26:53,909 --> 01:26:55,475
No, no, I'm sorry.

1309
01:26:55,477 --> 01:26:58,412
I'm sorry for
bringing you into all this.

1310
01:27:00,281 --> 01:27:02,683
I just wish that we could've
met some other way.

1311
01:27:03,785 --> 01:27:04,785
I don't.

1312
01:27:06,487 --> 01:27:07,588
Oh, man!

1313
01:27:08,289 --> 01:27:09,523
And you.

1314
01:27:10,625 --> 01:27:13,927
What a rock star.

1315
01:27:13,929 --> 01:27:15,629
Looks like I can get
all your money back.

1316
01:27:15,631 --> 01:27:17,631
They don't call me
hacker kween for nothin'.

1317
01:27:17,633 --> 01:27:19,566
Really? Thanks.
Yeah.

1318
01:27:30,945 --> 01:27:33,247
Crazy first date, huh?

1319
01:27:33,249 --> 01:27:34,014
Is that what that was?

1320
01:27:38,620 --> 01:27:41,888
By the way,
my real name is Sam.

1321
01:27:46,894 --> 01:27:48,328
Well, it's nice
to meet you, Sam.

1322
01:27:51,699 --> 01:27:53,000
It's nice to
meet you, vee.

1323
01:28:21,062 --> 01:28:23,764
Hey, vee, it's 28 degrees
