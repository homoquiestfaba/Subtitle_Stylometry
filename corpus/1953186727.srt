1
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:06,209
- How do I look?
- Great.

2
00:00:06,278 --> 00:00:07,802
I lost 20 pounds.

3
00:00:08,947 --> 00:00:14,715
Jenny Craig doesn't have anything on me.
It's for my Playgirl shoot.

4
00:00:15,254 --> 00:00:16,812
Wouldn't put it past you.

5
00:00:16,889 --> 00:00:21,383
No, that's one of the rumors I
heard, that I was gonna do that,

6
00:00:21,727 --> 00:00:23,695
- but wish it were true.
- He's all yours now.

7
00:00:23,762 --> 00:00:26,287
Hey.
That's a good makeup.

8
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:31,261
So, Drew, I was doing some
research on you last night.

9
00:00:31,336 --> 00:00:33,964
I am the most researched
man in America.

10
00:00:34,039 --> 00:00:37,372
I have a wife run off,
and I'm interesting.

11
00:00:37,643 --> 00:00:40,373
Oh, you are interesting,
believe me.

12
00:00:41,447 --> 00:00:44,007
So, Drew,
Stacy was your fourth wife.

13
00:00:44,083 --> 00:00:45,641
You really been
married that many times?

14
00:00:45,718 --> 00:00:47,208
That's right.

15
00:00:47,286 --> 00:00:49,880
Such bad luck with wives,
why do you keep doing it?

16
00:00:50,355 --> 00:00:54,052
You like vanilla, I like chocolate.
I like being married.

17
00:00:54,993 --> 00:00:58,019
I like to belong to somebody.

18
00:00:58,363 --> 00:01:00,627
And, you know, I'm a romantic.

19
00:01:00,699 --> 00:01:02,894
What's so great about marriage?

20
00:01:02,968 --> 00:01:04,492
Honeymoons.

21
00:01:05,037 --> 00:01:06,595
Okay.

22
00:01:06,672 --> 00:01:10,369
And Kathleen Savio
was wife number three.

23
00:01:10,809 --> 00:01:14,370
Beautiful girl. And fun.

24
00:01:14,446 --> 00:01:18,712
We laughed,
did some comedy between us.

25
00:01:18,784 --> 00:01:22,743
And then,
of course, she changed.

26
00:01:22,821 --> 00:01:24,584
How long did the honeymoon
last with her?

27
00:01:24,656 --> 00:01:28,387
Not long enough. The honeymoons
never last long enough.

28
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:34,758
Drew. Okay. Drew.

29
00:01:36,068 --> 00:01:37,501
Justin!

30
00:01:39,705 --> 00:01:42,196
I told you, I told you
the kids were gonna hear us.

31
00:01:42,274 --> 00:01:44,799
Justin, you have to wait
until we say to come in.

32
00:01:44,877 --> 00:01:47,471
But Zach's taking soda bottles
out of the fridge again.

33
00:01:47,546 --> 00:01:48,911
See, but you couldn't be quiet.

34
00:01:48,981 --> 00:01:51,848
No, you were getting too
much loving from Big Daddy.

35
00:01:51,917 --> 00:01:55,853
Did you hear what he said? He said Zach
is trying that soda-bomb thing again.

36
00:01:55,921 --> 00:01:58,287
All right, I'll put
the fear of God into him.

37
00:01:59,758 --> 00:02:01,123
Drew!

38
00:02:01,627 --> 00:02:04,118
Justin, close your
eyes and go out. Go on.

39
00:02:06,765 --> 00:02:08,756
You could have told
him to go out first.

40
00:02:09,601 --> 00:02:12,365
He has a right to know why
they call me Big Daddy.

41
00:02:12,771 --> 00:02:16,571
Yeah? Have you been inside
a men's locker room lately?

42
00:02:17,409 --> 00:02:19,969
You know, maybe I don't have
to come back here and finish.

43
00:02:20,045 --> 00:02:21,342
Drew, I'm teasing.

44
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,648
Well, maybe I'm teasing, too.

45
00:02:23,715 --> 00:02:26,013
You're gonna have
to wait to find out.

46
00:02:28,353 --> 00:02:30,082
So,
what's the little guy do?

47
00:02:30,155 --> 00:02:32,988
He's taking candies and he's
putting them in the liter bottles

48
00:02:33,058 --> 00:02:36,186
and shaking them
so they explode everywhere.

49
00:02:36,261 --> 00:02:39,196
And I mean it,
they're exploding everywhere.

50
00:02:39,264 --> 00:02:40,959
Is that why your
hair's so gray?

51
00:02:42,568 --> 00:02:44,627
You know what? I kinda like it.

52
00:02:45,237 --> 00:02:49,230
It makes me look sort of, I
don't know, suave and debonair.

53
00:02:53,345 --> 00:02:57,145
Sergeant Peterson, yo!
Man, what you doing here?

54
00:02:57,216 --> 00:02:58,979
Just keeping the peace.

55
00:02:59,051 --> 00:03:01,246
Guess that's what you do, you
keep this here town humming.

56
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,753
I still ain't forgot
what you did for me,

57
00:03:02,821 --> 00:03:04,220
helping me out with
my little problem.

58
00:03:04,289 --> 00:03:06,883
I know you didn't mean to steal that money.
You were gonna give it back.

59
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:08,256
Yeah, and if it wasn't for you,

60
00:03:08,327 --> 00:03:09,589
I'd be sitting in
a cell right now.

61
00:03:09,862 --> 00:03:11,329
Right. Need anything, call me.

62
00:03:11,396 --> 00:03:13,830
All right, I will do that.
You take care now.

63
00:03:13,899 --> 00:03:14,957
All right. All right.

64
00:03:15,067 --> 00:03:17,831
Man, you got everybody and their
brother owing you favors.

65
00:03:17,936 --> 00:03:18,994
I'll take a look around.

66
00:03:19,071 --> 00:03:21,631
Excuse me... Stacy.

67
00:03:22,007 --> 00:03:23,838
Are you the one who called us?
Yes, I did.

68
00:03:24,042 --> 00:03:25,134
And have you seen the husband?

69
00:03:25,444 --> 00:03:27,776
Yeah. He's been running through here.
He has scissors.

70
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:30,008
Well, that's nice.

71
00:03:30,082 --> 00:03:32,175
Yeah. He's a little crazy,

72
00:03:32,251 --> 00:03:33,411
but love will do that to you.

73
00:03:34,486 --> 00:03:35,475
Love will do that to you.

74
00:03:35,554 --> 00:03:36,612
Mmm-hmm.

75
00:03:38,223 --> 00:03:40,691
You seem a little young
to know anything about love.

76
00:03:41,093 --> 00:03:42,219
Little young for you.

77
00:03:42,561 --> 00:03:44,654
I see. You think
I'm flirting with you.

78
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:46,721
I definitely think
you're hitting on me.

79
00:03:47,633 --> 00:03:49,362
You see,
if I didn't know better,

80
00:03:49,434 --> 00:03:51,129
I'd say you were
flirting with me.

81
00:03:52,371 --> 00:03:53,895
Regina!

82
00:03:54,673 --> 00:03:56,402
- Duty calls.
- Hey, where's my wife?

83
00:03:57,042 --> 00:03:58,202
Your ride's here.

84
00:04:00,045 --> 00:04:01,410
All right.

85
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:05,211
Let go! Come on! Man!

86
00:04:16,828 --> 00:04:17,920
So, what happened?

87
00:04:17,996 --> 00:04:19,623
Some crazy drunk.

88
00:04:21,433 --> 00:04:22,730
Hey, you see that cop
over there?

89
00:04:22,801 --> 00:04:24,860
The one on the left?

90
00:04:25,103 --> 00:04:27,298
Do you think he's hot?

91
00:04:27,372 --> 00:04:30,273
No. He's like 50.

92
00:04:38,817 --> 00:04:43,379
" Ride into the
sunset once again."

93
00:04:44,723 --> 00:04:48,955
Okay. Make sure you brush your
teeth, and no staying up past 10:00,

94
00:04:49,294 --> 00:04:51,057
even if Aunt Sofia lets you.

95
00:04:51,163 --> 00:04:54,360
Don't worry, boys. What your
mother don't know won't hurt her.

96
00:04:54,433 --> 00:04:58,460
Yeah, I know you. You let them stay
up late and watch scary movies.

97
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:00,936
It's a lot more fun than
going to the stupid party.

98
00:05:01,006 --> 00:05:02,166
Then don't come.

99
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,868
Right. And then
you'll pout for a week.

100
00:05:04,943 --> 00:05:07,741
I don't pout.
It's not my style.

101
00:05:09,448 --> 00:05:11,075
You don't pout!

102
00:05:11,149 --> 00:05:13,640
What should we call those
little comments and digs?

103
00:05:13,719 --> 00:05:15,414
Being a jerk? Being an ass?

104
00:05:15,487 --> 00:05:17,478
It's like this every month with her.
It's like clockwork.

105
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:33,594
Hey, guys!

106
00:05:44,483 --> 00:05:48,817
It's too much.
It's too much. Thank you.

107
00:05:53,258 --> 00:05:57,661
Love what you've done with the place.
Love that shade of gray.

108
00:05:57,729 --> 00:06:00,027
You remember how bad
it used to be?

109
00:06:00,165 --> 00:06:02,497
City spent 1.8 million
refurbishing this.

110
00:06:02,567 --> 00:06:04,262
Took someone in and come out
with a case of lice.

111
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:09,466
I mean, come on. Tell me you
couldn't be comfortable in here.

112
00:06:09,574 --> 00:06:11,371
It's almost like a motel room.

113
00:06:15,047 --> 00:06:16,480
We can try out the cot.

114
00:06:17,149 --> 00:06:18,548
I bet you've done that already.

115
00:06:20,619 --> 00:06:22,280
What are you talking about?

116
00:06:23,855 --> 00:06:25,186
I'd rather catch lice.

117
00:06:30,829 --> 00:06:33,195
Why don't you stay
in there for a while?

118
00:06:33,665 --> 00:06:36,725
Very funny. Open up.

119
00:06:37,069 --> 00:06:38,400
You said you'd prefer the lice.

120
00:06:41,373 --> 00:06:43,238
Let me out of here!

121
00:06:44,843 --> 00:06:46,811
You son of a bitch!

122
00:06:47,679 --> 00:06:51,115
Hey, Drew, we don't want
the captain coming down here.

123
00:06:53,718 --> 00:06:56,448
Do you know how much
I hate you sometimes?

124
00:07:10,669 --> 00:07:12,432
Sergeant Peterson.

125
00:07:12,737 --> 00:07:14,830
Why am I not
surprised to see you?

126
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:17,269
Well, I'm surprised to see you.

127
00:07:18,977 --> 00:07:22,640
You must have some kind
of a magnet inside you.

128
00:07:26,318 --> 00:07:27,580
Nice bike.

129
00:07:30,522 --> 00:07:33,423
" When you came around
you knocked me down. "

130
00:07:38,263 --> 00:07:40,629
" We can keep it like a secret. "

131
00:07:40,699 --> 00:07:43,793
" Nobody will ever know. "

132
00:07:46,138 --> 00:07:49,574
" I should have told you
a long time ago. "

133
00:07:51,957 --> 00:07:57,057
A subtitle made possible by R3V0LV3R.

134
00:07:58,283 --> 00:07:59,409
You own a plane?

135
00:07:59,551 --> 00:08:00,677
Yeah.

136
00:08:01,553 --> 00:08:03,919
Yeah, it's fun to
fly over Lake Michigan

137
00:08:05,891 --> 00:08:08,883
or across to Madison
for lunch or something.

138
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,487
Wow. You must have a lot of
money to own your own plane.

139
00:08:13,498 --> 00:08:16,865
Yeah, I do all right.
And I own some businesses.

140
00:08:16,935 --> 00:08:19,426
Do you know Suds over on Elkins Street?
That's mine.

141
00:08:19,938 --> 00:08:22,236
Gosh. I can't imagine
what that feels like.

142
00:08:22,374 --> 00:08:24,706
I'm always worried about money.

143
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:27,337
Well, you should let me take
you out for steak and lobster.

144
00:08:28,513 --> 00:08:29,980
I've never had lobster.

145
00:08:33,051 --> 00:08:34,518
You are so beautiful.

146
00:08:36,454 --> 00:08:37,978
So, then, you're taking me out?

147
00:08:38,356 --> 00:08:41,154
I'd like to take you out.

148
00:08:41,226 --> 00:08:43,023
But I think there's something
you should know first.

149
00:08:43,094 --> 00:08:46,552
I don't care how old you are.
I just don't.

150
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:54,232
Technically,
I am still married.

151
00:08:57,108 --> 00:08:58,632
Technically?

152
00:09:07,319 --> 00:09:08,343
Good morning.

153
00:09:10,622 --> 00:09:11,953
You are such a liar!

154
00:09:12,023 --> 00:09:13,183
Hey, you cut it out.

155
00:09:13,258 --> 00:09:16,022
I'm so sick of your lying!
Where were you?

156
00:09:16,094 --> 00:09:17,493
- You're late!
- I'm not late. I was at work.

157
00:09:17,562 --> 00:09:19,462
You're lying every time
you open your mouth!

158
00:09:19,531 --> 00:09:22,227
You know what, I'm tired of your psycho talk.
I'm sick of it.

159
00:09:22,334 --> 00:09:24,234
- What do you mean you're sick of it?
- Mom, are you okay?

160
00:09:24,302 --> 00:09:25,667
Justin, get upstairs.
You psychotic bastard!

161
00:09:25,737 --> 00:09:26,965
Your mom's acting crazy.

162
00:09:27,239 --> 00:09:32,370
Don't you dare act like I'm the crazy one!
I am not crazy!

163
00:09:32,444 --> 00:09:34,378
Stop fighting!

164
00:09:43,021 --> 00:09:45,421
Drew, you're not serious!

165
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:47,925
It's all yours.

166
00:09:48,426 --> 00:09:51,361
No. You can't buy me a car.
It's too much!

167
00:09:51,429 --> 00:09:54,592
It is okay for you to
let me take care of you.

168
00:09:58,637 --> 00:10:00,571
I just wanna make
your life perfect.

169
00:10:01,473 --> 00:10:03,373
You already do.

170
00:10:05,176 --> 00:10:07,201
You wanna make
out in the backseat?

171
00:10:08,747 --> 00:10:11,910
Well, he bought me a car. It's
just proof he's getting a divorce.

172
00:10:11,983 --> 00:10:14,042
Or it proves
his wife is stupid.

173
00:10:14,119 --> 00:10:16,553
Look, will you stop harping
on Drew using me, please?

174
00:10:16,621 --> 00:10:18,885
She's just jealous she doesn't have
a boyfriend who'll buy her a car.

175
00:10:18,957 --> 00:10:22,017
I am not. There's no way I would
sleep with someone just for a car.

176
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:23,887
Hey, I didn't know
he was gonna buy me the car.

177
00:10:23,962 --> 00:10:26,055
So you just like screwing
guys older than your dad?

178
00:10:26,665 --> 00:10:29,896
Stop it! Be nice.
You're my sister. Come on.

179
00:10:29,968 --> 00:10:31,799
This sister is nice to me.

180
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:35,431
What I wanna know is why
you've never bought me a car.

181
00:10:36,574 --> 00:10:38,269
I'm gonna check on the chicken.

182
00:10:39,377 --> 00:10:41,709
Look, you guys, I don't care
what anyone thinks, okay?

183
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:44,112
Drew is sweet to me.
He wants to take care of me.

184
00:10:44,749 --> 00:10:47,684
Stacy,
he still lives with his wife.

185
00:10:47,752 --> 00:10:49,379
Not for much longer.

186
00:10:53,725 --> 00:10:56,523
Okay,
what if Kathleen wakes up?

187
00:10:56,594 --> 00:10:57,993
She won't.

188
00:10:58,063 --> 00:10:59,462
What if the boys wake up?

189
00:10:59,531 --> 00:11:01,158
They're not gonna wake up.
Come on.

190
00:11:01,299 --> 00:11:03,199
Look, I can just get a room
at that motel again. Come on.

191
00:11:03,268 --> 00:11:06,135
No, no, no, no.
It's fine. Hang on.

192
00:11:10,742 --> 00:11:12,642
I'm really not sure about this.

193
00:11:12,744 --> 00:11:16,544
So what? It's still better
than the backseat of a car.

194
00:11:20,719 --> 00:11:21,879
Hi.

195
00:11:25,557 --> 00:11:28,856
Let's see if we can guess what
Kathleen's problem is today.

196
00:11:31,529 --> 00:11:34,589
I found this letter
in our mailbox last night

197
00:11:36,501 --> 00:11:38,731
telling me how stupid
I am that I don't know

198
00:11:38,803 --> 00:11:40,964
my husband is having an affair.

199
00:11:44,509 --> 00:11:46,909
What are you talking about?

200
00:11:46,978 --> 00:11:48,878
You're cheating on me, Drew.

201
00:11:52,584 --> 00:11:55,018
This doesn't even
have a signature.

202
00:11:55,086 --> 00:11:56,986
Is this one of your mind games?
Shut up!

203
00:11:57,288 --> 00:11:58,949
I'm sick and tired
of your crap!

204
00:11:59,324 --> 00:12:01,053
Just get out of here!
Get out of my house!

205
00:12:02,527 --> 00:12:03,824
This is my house.

206
00:12:03,895 --> 00:12:05,260
Don't ever forget that.

207
00:12:05,764 --> 00:12:07,129
Don't touch me.

208
00:12:07,332 --> 00:12:09,630
Never, ever touch me again.

209
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:13,999
Don't be so dramatic.

210
00:12:18,109 --> 00:12:19,371
Drew, hi.

211
00:12:19,511 --> 00:12:21,308
Hi. Kathleen got a letter...

212
00:12:24,949 --> 00:12:28,009
Kathleen got a letter saying that
I was fooling around on her.

213
00:12:28,186 --> 00:12:30,120
You better tell me
that that wasn't you.

214
00:12:31,689 --> 00:12:33,281
Drew, it wasn't.

215
00:12:36,194 --> 00:12:39,630
She's gone and thrown all my
crap out all over the yard.

216
00:12:39,697 --> 00:12:42,530
I'm gonna have to find
somewhere else to live.

217
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,194
Well, good. Now maybe we
can get a place together.

218
00:12:46,504 --> 00:12:49,496
That would go over really big
with the divorce judge,

219
00:12:49,574 --> 00:12:53,305
me shacking up with my
girlfriend who's half my age.

220
00:12:53,378 --> 00:12:55,278
Kathleen would bleed me dry.

221
00:12:56,581 --> 00:12:58,549
I thought you said
you wanted us to be together.

222
00:12:58,917 --> 00:13:01,351
I do, but on my terms.

223
00:13:02,387 --> 00:13:04,855
Well, maybe I have terms now.

224
00:13:08,059 --> 00:13:09,117
I'm pregnant.

225
00:13:13,598 --> 00:13:15,395
And I'm keeping it.
I already decided.

226
00:13:15,934 --> 00:13:17,731
- Hello, madam. Checking in?
- Hi. Yes.

227
00:13:17,802 --> 00:13:19,201
Are you mad?

228
00:13:22,807 --> 00:13:26,174
My heart just was
leaping out of my chest.

229
00:13:26,244 --> 00:13:28,712
I'm so, so happy.

230
00:13:30,715 --> 00:13:32,706
Now nothing else matters.

231
00:13:34,853 --> 00:13:38,482
They're here, and they're
gonna throw your ass outta here!

232
00:13:39,224 --> 00:13:42,216
Or maybe they're gonna put
the crazy lady in cuffs.

233
00:13:42,293 --> 00:13:45,228
I am not crazy!
You broke in here!

234
00:13:45,296 --> 00:13:47,025
Technically,
I still own this house.

235
00:13:47,098 --> 00:13:48,429
Hey, Jimmy. How you doing?

236
00:13:48,967 --> 00:13:51,128
About the same as I was when
I was out here two days ago.

237
00:13:51,202 --> 00:13:52,362
I want him arrested.

238
00:13:52,437 --> 00:13:53,665
Kathy, you know
I'm not gonna do that.

239
00:13:53,738 --> 00:13:55,296
I have the right to protection!

240
00:13:55,373 --> 00:13:56,806
I just came for my
socks and underwear.

241
00:13:56,875 --> 00:13:59,343
You liar! I wanna
see what's in that bag!

242
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:01,071
You see what
I have to deal with?

243
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:07,111
It goes in the man cave.

244
00:14:08,219 --> 00:14:09,880
The den, you moron.

245
00:14:10,188 --> 00:14:11,746
Butthead.

246
00:14:11,823 --> 00:14:16,556
Hey, honey, wait till you see how
cute the crib looks in the bedroom.

247
00:14:16,628 --> 00:14:18,391
It's so adorable.
I put the sheets down

248
00:14:18,463 --> 00:14:20,624
and the bumper and
the spinny thing.

249
00:14:20,698 --> 00:14:22,598
Mobile. It's called a mobile.

250
00:14:22,667 --> 00:14:27,001
Yes. That. It's so cute. Our
baby's gonna love it so, so much.

251
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:28,868
And it matches everything.

252
00:14:30,608 --> 00:14:32,337
All right.
Where's the camera?

253
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:33,502
'Cause if she
starts going ballistic,

254
00:14:33,578 --> 00:14:34,806
I'm gonna have some
evidence this time.

255
00:14:39,217 --> 00:14:40,445
Don't worry.

256
00:14:40,852 --> 00:14:43,320
I'm not gonna deprive your
baby of having a father.

257
00:14:43,388 --> 00:14:45,117
I already agreed
to the divorce.

258
00:14:46,024 --> 00:14:48,857
But I'm not going to
sign those divorce papers

259
00:14:48,927 --> 00:14:50,292
until you sign this agreement

260
00:14:50,361 --> 00:14:53,387
that we still have to negotiate
the property settlement.

261
00:14:53,464 --> 00:14:55,557
See, I don't think
"negotiate" is the word for

262
00:14:55,633 --> 00:14:57,658
what your lawyer's
trying to do to me.

263
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:59,827
Well, I think he's
doing a great job of

264
00:14:59,904 --> 00:15:01,394
getting the judge to
consider what's fair.

265
00:15:01,606 --> 00:15:04,302
"Job, " that's the word,
but put "blow" in front of it.

266
00:15:04,809 --> 00:15:06,071
You want your
quickie divorce or not?

267
00:15:07,245 --> 00:15:09,736
You got a pen?

268
00:15:09,814 --> 00:15:10,872
I'll get a pen.

269
00:15:14,586 --> 00:15:15,610
I feel sorry for you.

270
00:15:16,955 --> 00:15:18,445
You actually
believe he's a catch.

271
00:15:19,524 --> 00:15:20,991
Well, I don't care
what you think.

272
00:15:21,826 --> 00:15:24,317
I used to be you,
and one day you'll be me,

273
00:15:25,163 --> 00:15:28,496
and you'll regret the day you
ever laid eyes on Drew Peterson.

274
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:32,001
I will never be like you,
mean and bitter.

275
00:15:32,604 --> 00:15:35,266
Look, this house is gonna be
full of love and laughter

276
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:37,331
and I'm sorry if
that makes you jealous,

277
00:15:37,408 --> 00:15:39,137
but you had your
chance with him.

278
00:15:39,844 --> 00:15:40,868
It's my turn.

279
00:15:41,479 --> 00:15:43,572
You can have him, little girl.

280
00:15:43,815 --> 00:15:45,510
He's all yours.

281
00:15:48,987 --> 00:15:50,682
You really waited
to get married

282
00:15:50,755 --> 00:15:52,416
just so you'd fit
into this dress?

283
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:55,323
Well, that and so we'd have
more fun on the wedding night.

284
00:15:55,393 --> 00:15:57,224
Please don't put
that image in my head.

285
00:15:57,295 --> 00:16:00,196
Stop. Come on. Look at Lauren
and Rick, okay? He's older.

286
00:16:00,565 --> 00:16:02,726
Eleven years, not 30.

287
00:16:03,001 --> 00:16:06,801
Who cares? I have the
family I've always wanted.

288
00:16:07,305 --> 00:16:09,899
You mean the money you always wanted,
the house you always wanted...

289
00:16:09,974 --> 00:16:12,807
Brianna, it's her wedding day.
Let her be happy.

290
00:16:13,344 --> 00:16:17,405
I'm sorry. I just have a hard time
believing that this guy made you happy.

291
00:16:17,482 --> 00:16:19,848
Yeah, well, there won't
be money for much longer.

292
00:16:19,917 --> 00:16:22,477
Kathleen gets half of
everything in the settlement.

293
00:16:22,553 --> 00:16:25,920
The hearing's next month,
then poof, that money's gone.

294
00:16:27,859 --> 00:16:31,556
He could have stayed with
her, kept all that money,

295
00:16:31,629 --> 00:16:34,462
but he chose me
and our perfect baby.

296
00:16:36,234 --> 00:16:37,826
He loves me.

297
00:17:03,094 --> 00:17:05,324
I don't know how
you do it, Drew.

298
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:08,794
How you get these luscious
women to keep marrying you.

299
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:10,362
Justin.

300
00:17:11,269 --> 00:17:13,897
Tell your Uncle Glenn here that
Big Daddy's got it going on.

301
00:17:14,372 --> 00:17:16,033
Big Daddy's got it going on.

302
00:17:16,107 --> 00:17:17,734
Yeah, I'd say so.

303
00:17:26,818 --> 00:17:28,080
Hi.

304
00:17:29,687 --> 00:17:32,212
Hey, now, you're
supposed to wait for that.

305
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:34,622
I know, but I couldn't
wait another second.

306
00:17:41,132 --> 00:17:43,032
So you married Stacy

307
00:17:43,101 --> 00:17:44,466
but there were several calls to

308
00:17:44,535 --> 00:17:45,866
the Bolingbrook
Police Department

309
00:17:45,937 --> 00:17:50,533
to settle fights between you
and Kathleen, 18 calls in all.

310
00:17:51,342 --> 00:17:55,608
A lot of those calls were made
by me, to protect me from her.

311
00:17:56,247 --> 00:17:58,408
She says that you
broke into her house,

312
00:17:58,483 --> 00:18:02,613
that you held her down on the
stairs and threatened to kill her.

313
00:18:03,688 --> 00:18:06,020
Right. Well, if you knew Kathy,

314
00:18:06,157 --> 00:18:08,523
you would know
how ridiculous that is.

315
00:18:09,727 --> 00:18:12,025
You know,
if I were to go to hell,

316
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:16,123
and the devil would say, "There's
nothing I can do to you."

317
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,395
"You've already been married
to Kathy Peterson."

318
00:18:18,836 --> 00:18:21,270
She says that you
broke into her house,

319
00:18:21,339 --> 00:18:24,706
that you held her down on the
stairs and threatened to kill her.

320
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:28,344
Well, I'm a police officer.

321
00:18:28,412 --> 00:18:30,880
I don't work for the power
company or the phone company.

322
00:18:30,948 --> 00:18:35,408
And if I were to get involved in
some sort of domestic dispute,

323
00:18:35,486 --> 00:18:40,185
or get physical, you know, with
my wife, I could lose my job.

324
00:18:40,925 --> 00:18:45,919
And I kinda challenge anybody out
there who's ever even seen me mad.

325
00:18:47,965 --> 00:18:50,832
Come on. Let's go, guys.
Got to get back to your mom's.

326
00:18:50,902 --> 00:18:52,301
But wait. They haven't
finished eating yet.

327
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:54,463
If I'm two minutes late,
Kathleen will say

328
00:18:54,539 --> 00:18:57,167
I'm violating a court order.
So, let's go.

329
00:18:57,875 --> 00:19:01,436
Okay. Well, guys,
it was a really fun weekend!

330
00:19:04,048 --> 00:19:05,379
I love you!

331
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:08,176
- Race you to Mom's!
- Wait up!

332
00:19:08,986 --> 00:19:10,920
They don't love me back.

333
00:19:10,988 --> 00:19:12,046
Don't worry.

334
00:19:12,123 --> 00:19:15,524
Soon, they're gonna think you're
the best mom in the world.

335
00:19:15,593 --> 00:19:17,254
I promise.

336
00:19:17,328 --> 00:19:19,353
Hey, honey, the clothes you
put in the wash last night,

337
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:22,763
I'm happy to do your laundry.
Just put it in the hamper.

338
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:37,110
I can fit
through the doggy door.

339
00:19:37,181 --> 00:19:39,513
Why don't you guys
walk back to my house,

340
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:41,982
and I'll figure out
where your mom is.

341
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:45,345
- But I...
- No. No buts. Go on.

342
00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:01,465
I don't know why you just
don't go in yourself.

343
00:20:01,539 --> 00:20:03,063
Because I'm not stupid.

344
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:04,471
Well, how does
that make you stupid?

345
00:20:04,542 --> 00:20:07,739
Because Kathleen accuses me
of all kinds of things.

346
00:20:07,812 --> 00:20:11,441
She gets restraining orders, and
so I just can't go in there.

347
00:20:11,515 --> 00:20:13,779
I need somebody else to do it.

348
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:26,995
Kathleen?

349
00:20:28,165 --> 00:20:29,291
It's your neighbor, Brad.

350
00:20:31,402 --> 00:20:32,733
Kathleen?

351
00:20:46,884 --> 00:20:49,148
Drew? Drew!

352
00:20:50,521 --> 00:20:51,954
Drew!

353
00:21:22,453 --> 00:21:24,751
What am I gonna tell my kids?

354
00:21:27,358 --> 00:21:29,724
What am I gonna tell them?

355
00:21:33,397 --> 00:21:35,388
Hey. Joe Hosey with the Herald.

356
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:37,697
I got word there was
a suspicious death here

357
00:21:37,768 --> 00:21:41,067
with the ex-wife of one
Sergeant Drew Peterson.

358
00:21:41,138 --> 00:21:43,197
What do you think?
Is there a story?

359
00:21:43,274 --> 00:21:45,742
Here he is.
Why don't you ask him?

360
00:21:46,043 --> 00:21:48,068
If you say what I told you
to say, you'll be fine.

361
00:21:48,179 --> 00:21:50,647
I know. I just hate the way they stare
at me when they're talking to me.

362
00:21:50,715 --> 00:21:52,012
They're like zombies.

363
00:21:52,116 --> 00:21:53,105
You'll be great.

364
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:54,239
Hey. Joe Hosey with the Herald.

365
00:21:54,552 --> 00:21:56,543
I'm checking into a possible
story on your ex-wife's death.

366
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:59,418
I'm sorry to disappoint you, but
there's really no story there.

367
00:21:59,623 --> 00:22:00,851
Is it okay that
I quote you on that?

368
00:22:02,793 --> 00:22:07,059
Well, I'm really sad about it, and
my boys are really broken up.

369
00:22:07,131 --> 00:22:08,928
That's what I'm
thinking about right now.

370
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,959
Today is just a formality,
sort of pain in the ass.

371
00:22:19,176 --> 00:22:20,939
Where was your
husband after 9:00 p.m.

372
00:22:21,012 --> 00:22:23,537
the night before
his ex-wife was found?

373
00:22:24,048 --> 00:22:27,142
Um, he was
putting Austin to bed,

374
00:22:27,551 --> 00:22:33,353
and then we went to bed
together around 10:30.

375
00:22:34,091 --> 00:22:37,060
So, to your knowledge, he was
sleeping with you the entire night?

376
00:22:37,628 --> 00:22:38,686
Um...

377
00:22:39,864 --> 00:22:41,764
You know, I'm sorry.

378
00:22:41,832 --> 00:22:44,801
It's just, it's kind of hard
being questioned like this.

379
00:22:44,869 --> 00:22:46,200
We just found out
that I'm pregnant again

380
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:48,636
so I think that the stress
is not good for the baby.

381
00:22:49,173 --> 00:22:52,006
No need to stress. I'm just
getting through paperwork here.

382
00:22:52,076 --> 00:22:53,566
The results of
the autopsy came back

383
00:22:53,644 --> 00:22:55,874
with the cause of death
being accidental drowning.

384
00:22:56,881 --> 00:22:59,179
Accident. Oh...

385
00:23:01,385 --> 00:23:02,409
Thank God.

386
00:23:07,658 --> 00:23:09,683
Come on. Try and steal it.

387
00:23:10,528 --> 00:23:12,325
Come on. Try and take
it from me. Come on.

388
00:23:13,998 --> 00:23:15,863
Come on. Guys!

389
00:23:16,901 --> 00:23:18,766
That's not very enthusiastic.

390
00:23:19,003 --> 00:23:20,800
Your mom wouldn't want you
moping the rest of your life.

391
00:23:20,871 --> 00:23:22,202
Hey, guys.

392
00:23:22,273 --> 00:23:24,707
Things aren't that bad. Stacy's
been taking good care of you.

393
00:23:24,775 --> 00:23:27,266
The new neighbors just moved in.
Let's go say hi.

394
00:23:27,812 --> 00:23:28,836
Why would you wanna do that?

395
00:23:29,713 --> 00:23:31,510
You got a baby in the house.
You got a baby in there.

396
00:23:31,582 --> 00:23:34,380
You got guys right here. What do
you wanna go over there for now?

397
00:23:35,152 --> 00:23:36,847
Well, I want to go say hello!

398
00:23:36,921 --> 00:23:38,445
Why wouldn't you
be staying home?

399
00:23:38,522 --> 00:23:41,616
Fine. If you don't wanna go with
me, I'll just go by myself.

400
00:23:43,961 --> 00:23:47,988
Used to be, a man could keep his
woman pregnant in the house.

401
00:23:49,567 --> 00:23:50,625
Yes!

402
00:23:50,701 --> 00:23:52,259
That was so nice
of you to come over.

403
00:23:52,336 --> 00:23:53,860
You didn't have
to bring dinner.

404
00:23:53,938 --> 00:23:56,031
What was that sort of
unusual flavor in it?

405
00:23:56,107 --> 00:23:58,132
Pumpkin spice.

406
00:23:58,209 --> 00:23:59,642
Pumpkin spice in the chili?

407
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:02,304
Yeah. It's a trick
my sister, Lauren, taught me.

408
00:24:02,379 --> 00:24:05,837
She's more like my mom
than my real mom ever was.

409
00:24:05,916 --> 00:24:07,884
She took off
when I was 12, so...

410
00:24:07,952 --> 00:24:09,249
And, by the way,
if you just take this road,

411
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:11,686
you can get to the market way
faster than hitting the light.

412
00:24:12,189 --> 00:24:14,180
You are so sweet
to show me around.

413
00:24:14,258 --> 00:24:17,853
It's no problem. I don't get
out much with four kids.

414
00:24:17,928 --> 00:24:20,726
Well, if you ever need me to
watch them, I'm right next door.

415
00:24:20,798 --> 00:24:22,425
Oh, thanks.

416
00:24:23,601 --> 00:24:25,535
How are the boys doing?

417
00:24:25,603 --> 00:24:27,798
Zach's better, but not Justin.

418
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:32,733
Karen, sometimes he cries so hard,
and it just breaks my heart.

419
00:24:33,444 --> 00:24:35,605
But I'm legally
adopting both of them.

420
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:38,773
I don't want them ever to
think they don't have a mom.

421
00:24:38,883 --> 00:24:42,785
This is the house Drew shared
with Kathleen and the boys.

422
00:24:42,853 --> 00:24:45,981
This is where they found
her body in the bathtub.

423
00:24:48,759 --> 00:24:51,489
Wow. It's so close.

424
00:24:51,562 --> 00:24:53,029
I know.

425
00:24:53,097 --> 00:24:55,361
Actually, Drew used to
sneak me into the basement

426
00:24:55,432 --> 00:24:58,333
when we first started
seeing each other.

427
00:24:58,402 --> 00:24:59,733
I used to freak out thinking.

428
00:24:59,803 --> 00:25:03,739
Kathleen was gonna wake up
and come beat me up.

429
00:25:07,278 --> 00:25:10,441
He brought you into the house while
his wife was still upstairs?

430
00:25:11,382 --> 00:25:14,408
Honey, Stacy, that's not right.

431
00:25:15,419 --> 00:25:17,944
Well, he had to. I mean,
everyone knows him in this town.

432
00:25:18,022 --> 00:25:20,616
And, plus, she was horrible.

433
00:25:24,929 --> 00:25:28,228
Yeah, I guess it
really wasn't right, was it?

434
00:25:30,668 --> 00:25:32,363
Come on, man. You don't get it.

435
00:25:32,503 --> 00:25:34,198
I just needed
the money for some food.

436
00:25:34,305 --> 00:25:36,296
Are you idiots eating meth now?

437
00:25:36,373 --> 00:25:37,533
Hey, I wouldn't
put it past him.

438
00:25:37,608 --> 00:25:40,543
No, man. My girl. She just
found out she's pregnant.

439
00:25:40,878 --> 00:25:44,109
My wife is pregnant, and you don't
see me out there nabbing purses.

440
00:25:44,615 --> 00:25:46,742
When's Stacy gonna pop anyway?

441
00:25:46,817 --> 00:25:49,877
God, I think her due
date was last week.

442
00:25:50,888 --> 00:25:54,051
And, trust me, you do not
want this to happen.

443
00:25:54,124 --> 00:25:58,754
I mean, they're all
hopped up on hormones.

444
00:25:59,530 --> 00:26:03,261
You think your girl is a nightmare
when she's jonesing for tweak?

445
00:26:03,968 --> 00:26:07,995
Wait till she
becomes a big, fat,

446
00:26:08,072 --> 00:26:09,801
sweaty monster.

447
00:26:09,873 --> 00:26:12,171
All right, Drew.
I think you're scaring him.

448
00:26:12,443 --> 00:26:13,535
He should be scared.

449
00:26:13,611 --> 00:26:16,102
The woman he fell in love with
is about to disappear.

450
00:26:20,017 --> 00:26:21,746
Speak of the devil.

451
00:26:38,469 --> 00:26:39,766
All right. Come on.

452
00:26:40,471 --> 00:26:43,406
Let's go. It's your lucky day.

453
00:26:44,208 --> 00:26:48,406
My wife's water broke, and with any
luck, I'm gonna have a baby girl.

454
00:26:50,381 --> 00:26:51,439
Can I get a ride back?

455
00:26:51,582 --> 00:26:52,674
Don't push your luck.

456
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:05,422
So pure, like an angel.

457
00:27:06,764 --> 00:27:10,461
Don't worry. Daddy's not gonna let
any of the dirty boys get you.

458
00:27:11,602 --> 00:27:13,467
No, ma'am.

459
00:27:13,904 --> 00:27:16,270
What are you saying to her?

460
00:27:17,708 --> 00:27:19,539
Don't lose this one.

461
00:27:20,277 --> 00:27:22,040
I'll find the
other one eventually.

462
00:27:22,479 --> 00:27:24,606
Well, you need one now.

463
00:27:24,682 --> 00:27:27,378
I mean, I can't be out at work at
night and not know you're safe.

464
00:27:27,885 --> 00:27:29,182
You need to answer that.

465
00:27:29,286 --> 00:27:30,514
Honey, I always
answer when you call.

466
00:27:30,654 --> 00:27:31,882
Not all the time.

467
00:27:31,989 --> 00:27:33,786
So answer this
on the third ring.

468
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,388
You're not serious?

469
00:27:37,594 --> 00:27:40,062
I gotta know you're safe.
I gotta know where you are.

470
00:27:41,598 --> 00:27:43,725
Okay, fine. The third ring.

471
00:27:47,071 --> 00:27:48,538
Looks good.

472
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:51,201
Get out of here.

473
00:27:51,275 --> 00:27:53,004
- Don't fall.
- I won't.

474
00:27:53,744 --> 00:27:55,302
Does it look straight? Yeah.

475
00:27:55,379 --> 00:27:57,313
It looks perfect. Good.

476
00:27:57,514 --> 00:28:00,278
I knew you'd be good
at this decorating thing.

477
00:28:01,719 --> 00:28:02,879
Aw.

478
00:28:03,854 --> 00:28:06,516
What are you doing?

479
00:28:06,657 --> 00:28:11,390
Mommy's here. Yeah! It's okay.

480
00:28:12,329 --> 00:28:17,460
All I ever wanted was a little girl.
I got exactly what I wanted.

481
00:28:18,802 --> 00:28:21,236
I just hope Drew
will let us be happy.

482
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,000
Why wouldn't Drew
let you be happy?

483
00:28:27,177 --> 00:28:30,635
Oh, I'm just being hormonal.

484
00:28:30,714 --> 00:28:33,444
Zach's graduation is this Friday.
Do you wanna come?

485
00:28:34,051 --> 00:28:35,814
Edward Taylor.

486
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:38,715
Ryan Bates.

487
00:28:39,523 --> 00:28:41,286
Jacob Roberts.

488
00:28:41,525 --> 00:28:43,550
God, I wish they
would get to Zach already.

489
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:45,992
If I don't go home and feed
Kaitlyn soon, I'm gonna burst.

490
00:28:48,065 --> 00:28:50,499
Why would you be talking
about your boobs here?

491
00:28:50,567 --> 00:28:51,693
What's wrong with you?

492
00:28:54,037 --> 00:28:55,197
Timothy Stevens.

493
00:28:56,573 --> 00:28:58,404
Casey Robinson.

494
00:28:59,676 --> 00:29:03,407
I want to know what guy
you've got in your head

495
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,141
that you're worried
about your boobs for.

496
00:29:05,349 --> 00:29:06,748
Oh, my... Stop!

497
00:29:07,551 --> 00:29:08,950
Zach Peterson.

498
00:29:10,053 --> 00:29:11,611
Yay, Zachie!

499
00:29:12,122 --> 00:29:15,285
I'll ask you once again, please,
hold your applause until the end.

500
00:29:16,693 --> 00:29:17,717
Heather Miller.

501
00:29:18,529 --> 00:29:19,860
Joseph Baker.

502
00:29:21,465 --> 00:29:22,898
Walter Young.

503
00:29:24,067 --> 00:29:26,035
You guys should have seen Stacy.
She was so cute.

504
00:29:26,103 --> 00:29:28,469
She was blowing kisses
and waving at Zach.

505
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,073
I love the way she
looks after these boys.

506
00:29:33,477 --> 00:29:35,240
Sounds like you two are close.

507
00:29:35,312 --> 00:29:36,438
I adore her.

508
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:38,605
She said she wishes
you were her mom,

509
00:29:38,749 --> 00:29:40,774
which makes me so glad to hear,

510
00:29:41,185 --> 00:29:43,312
especially now
that I may not...

511
00:29:43,387 --> 00:29:44,752
What?

512
00:29:44,822 --> 00:29:48,223
We are waiting on some
test results for Lauren.

513
00:29:49,159 --> 00:29:50,353
Oh.

514
00:29:50,894 --> 00:29:52,953
I'm sure everything will be okay.

515
00:29:55,699 --> 00:29:57,564
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

516
00:30:03,006 --> 00:30:05,839
Hey, Glenn, you don't have to
put all the beers in the ice.

517
00:30:05,909 --> 00:30:06,933
Not everybody's
gonna drink one.

518
00:30:07,044 --> 00:30:10,502
Hey, Drew told me to put them all
on ice, I'm putting them on ice.

519
00:30:15,185 --> 00:30:17,016
Drew?

520
00:30:17,087 --> 00:30:19,317
Drew, why are you
looking at my phone?

521
00:30:20,724 --> 00:30:24,091
Because I worked undercover, and
I can read people like a book,

522
00:30:24,628 --> 00:30:25,720
and I can read you.

523
00:30:25,796 --> 00:30:27,229
There's nothing
to read on there!

524
00:30:27,965 --> 00:30:30,126
I know that when
you're blowing kisses around,

525
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,462
you're trying to reel in a guy,

526
00:30:32,169 --> 00:30:33,295
because that's how you got me.

527
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:35,998
I was blowing kisses
to our son, Zach.

528
00:30:36,406 --> 00:30:37,532
I'm gonna check your e-mail.

529
00:30:37,608 --> 00:30:40,099
What? You can't do that!
There's no one else, okay?

530
00:30:40,177 --> 00:30:42,577
You can't just read my e-mail
without asking me permission.

531
00:30:42,646 --> 00:30:44,238
I can do whatever I want.
I paid for it.

532
00:30:44,314 --> 00:30:46,248
No, you can't.
This is not your...

533
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:48,149
Stacy?

534
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:56,318
How's the hot-dog
situation out there?

535
00:30:57,661 --> 00:30:58,889
I don't know.
You'll have to ask the boys.

536
00:31:02,199 --> 00:31:03,496
I'll go check.

537
00:31:05,536 --> 00:31:06,696
Honey, is everything all right?

538
00:31:08,438 --> 00:31:10,269
Everything's fine.

539
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:13,173
Drew just threw me
into the TV, but...

540
00:31:13,243 --> 00:31:15,575
Wanna help me make
some more margaritas?

541
00:31:17,981 --> 00:31:23,385
Stacy's friends and family have accused
you of being controlling, mean.

542
00:31:23,453 --> 00:31:24,886
What do you say to them?

543
00:31:26,156 --> 00:31:29,523
Well, I'm not perfect.

544
00:31:29,927 --> 00:31:32,487
And anytime you're
under a microscope,

545
00:31:32,563 --> 00:31:34,827
people only want
to see the negative,

546
00:31:34,932 --> 00:31:39,335
and any of the positive gets
washed under the blankets.

547
00:31:39,703 --> 00:31:42,866
Why would you want to work?
I don't understand.

548
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:45,500
I make enough money.
The kids need you here.

549
00:31:45,576 --> 00:31:46,838
Drew, it's next door.

550
00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:50,175
I'm just gonna walk next door,
do a little paperwork for Karen

551
00:31:50,247 --> 00:31:51,509
while Austin's in preschool.

552
00:31:51,582 --> 00:31:52,913
She's gonna let
me bring the baby.

553
00:31:52,983 --> 00:31:57,477
But it's a slap in the face. I mean,
it's like you think I can't support you.

554
00:31:57,554 --> 00:32:00,421
Honey, don't feel that way. Why
do you have to feel that way?

555
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:01,752
Any man would.

556
00:32:01,825 --> 00:32:03,520
Any man from 1960.

557
00:32:03,594 --> 00:32:06,119
Look, women work now. I was
working when you met me.

558
00:32:06,196 --> 00:32:08,096
But I told you I was gonna
take you away from all that.

559
00:32:08,465 --> 00:32:10,865
Okay, well,
what if I want to work?

560
00:32:10,934 --> 00:32:12,663
I mean,
I just go a little crazy

561
00:32:12,736 --> 00:32:14,397
sitting in this
house every day.

562
00:32:15,472 --> 00:32:17,531
See? I thought this
is what you wanted.

563
00:32:19,076 --> 00:32:22,568
It is. It is.

564
00:32:25,282 --> 00:32:27,079
Why can't we just be happy?

565
00:32:28,585 --> 00:32:30,314
I am happy.

566
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,252
This is Karen.

567
00:32:38,328 --> 00:32:41,320
Karen, where's Stacy?
Is Stacy there?

568
00:32:41,398 --> 00:32:44,629
Yeah. She's about two aisles
over in the grocery store.

569
00:32:44,701 --> 00:32:45,929
Look, is she there or not?

570
00:32:46,003 --> 00:32:47,834
I just said she was.

571
00:32:47,904 --> 00:32:51,032
You know, you don't need to check
up on her when she's with me.

572
00:32:51,108 --> 00:32:52,837
How do I know what you
two are doing together

573
00:32:52,909 --> 00:32:54,501
when you're out there
on your little trips?

574
00:32:54,578 --> 00:32:57,046
Come on. Listen,
you want her to be with me.

575
00:32:57,114 --> 00:32:58,547
I mean, the most
trouble she's gonna get into

576
00:32:58,615 --> 00:33:01,846
is buying trashy magazines
at the checkout stand.

577
00:33:02,519 --> 00:33:04,749
Why don't you
give her some space?

578
00:33:05,355 --> 00:33:06,982
Is that Drew?

579
00:33:07,257 --> 00:33:08,724
Gosh. He's probably
been trying to call me.

580
00:33:08,792 --> 00:33:10,657
I left my
cell phone in the car.

581
00:33:10,727 --> 00:33:12,217
Okay, will you just
watch Kaitlyn for a minute?

582
00:33:12,295 --> 00:33:13,762
I gotta call him back.

583
00:33:30,947 --> 00:33:33,108
It's not even dark, and
you're dragging us by here?

584
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:37,351
You used to just do it late at night,
which, you know, I get, but...

585
00:33:37,421 --> 00:33:38,581
No, you don't.

586
00:33:38,655 --> 00:33:40,748
Hey, I'm married,
too, remember?

587
00:33:41,291 --> 00:33:42,724
Yeah, but I've seen your wife.

588
00:33:42,793 --> 00:33:45,284
She's not exactly
a stone-cold fox.

589
00:33:45,362 --> 00:33:46,454
Hey! Watch it!

590
00:33:46,863 --> 00:33:49,889
I'm just telling the truth.
I mean, look at Stacy.

591
00:33:51,601 --> 00:33:53,432
I mean, she's like a flower.

592
00:33:53,770 --> 00:33:56,671
You know,
in bloom and, you know,

593
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:58,435
putting her
scent out everywhere.

594
00:33:58,508 --> 00:34:00,976
And don't tell me
that you can't smell it.

595
00:34:01,678 --> 00:34:04,203
I ain't touching that one
with a 10-foot pole.

596
00:34:04,281 --> 00:34:07,409
That's right. You keep your
damn pole away from my wife.

597
00:34:10,721 --> 00:34:12,188
You're yanking my chain, right?

598
00:34:31,908 --> 00:34:34,502
Those boys are my nephews. I can
take them out for an ice cream cone.

599
00:34:34,578 --> 00:34:35,636
Yes, you can.

600
00:34:35,712 --> 00:34:37,043
It's just Drew
will be mad at me

601
00:34:37,114 --> 00:34:38,547
if I let you take
them without him knowing.

602
00:34:38,615 --> 00:34:40,810
He knew I was coming today.
I left him a message.

603
00:34:40,884 --> 00:34:42,784
But he didn't tell me. If you
just wait till he calls back...

604
00:34:42,853 --> 00:34:44,514
He's not gonna call you back!
Okay?

605
00:34:44,588 --> 00:34:47,022
It's part of his little game
to screw with me.

606
00:34:47,090 --> 00:34:48,284
You know what?

607
00:34:48,358 --> 00:34:50,588
You're probably part
of that game, so fine.

608
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:51,991
You win.

609
00:34:53,263 --> 00:34:56,858
Sofia, wait. Look, I know
the boys wanna see you!

610
00:34:56,933 --> 00:35:01,029
So let them come out and see me!
You're not those boys' mother.

611
00:35:01,772 --> 00:35:02,830
I think you know
what happened to

612
00:35:02,906 --> 00:35:04,032
their mother just
as well as I do,

613
00:35:04,107 --> 00:35:05,768
and Drew will go
to hell for it.

614
00:35:07,677 --> 00:35:08,974
Wait...

615
00:35:12,282 --> 00:35:14,273
Was that Kathleen's sister?

616
00:35:14,351 --> 00:35:17,081
Yeah. Kathleen was
exactly the same way.

617
00:35:17,154 --> 00:35:20,180
She used to come over all the
time and say nasty stuff to me.

618
00:35:20,957 --> 00:35:23,448
She said I was gonna end up just like her.

619
00:35:25,128 --> 00:35:26,595
Thought it was Drew.

620
00:35:26,696 --> 00:35:28,960
Hey, Rick. Is everything okay?

621
00:35:30,433 --> 00:35:31,798
Oh, no.

622
00:35:31,868 --> 00:35:34,996
Your sister
will be dearly missed.

623
00:35:39,576 --> 00:35:41,066
She was a strong woman.

624
00:35:42,779 --> 00:35:45,942
She'd accepted this
as God's will.

625
00:35:52,989 --> 00:35:55,685
He's full of it.
She fought so hard.

626
00:35:56,393 --> 00:35:57,917
Yeah, but she knew
it was coming.

627
00:35:59,362 --> 00:36:02,525
When I saw her last week, she
kept looking at me so funny,

628
00:36:04,067 --> 00:36:06,797
asking if I knew
how short life was.

629
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:09,668
Don't waste one day
being unhappy.

630
00:36:09,739 --> 00:36:11,934
That's what she said to me.

631
00:36:12,008 --> 00:36:13,669
I love you very much.

632
00:36:26,122 --> 00:36:29,319
Hey, you're blubbering
all over this nice suit.

633
00:36:30,861 --> 00:36:32,920
I got a box of Kleenex
in the car.

634
00:36:38,268 --> 00:36:39,758
I hate this.

635
00:36:40,303 --> 00:36:43,363
I hate it. She didn't
even make it past 30.

636
00:36:45,141 --> 00:36:46,369
This is kinda good
for you, though, right?

637
00:36:48,778 --> 00:36:50,541
I saw the way
you were touching Rick.

638
00:36:52,048 --> 00:36:53,242
I know you're
sleeping with him.

639
00:36:54,551 --> 00:36:57,111
All those times you told me you were
going to the hospital to see Lauren,

640
00:36:57,187 --> 00:36:58,814
I know you were
sneaking off with him.

641
00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:03,486
My sister's in that casket.

642
00:37:05,295 --> 00:37:07,229
You see? You didn't deny it.

643
00:37:08,899 --> 00:37:12,357
You're disgusting. I can't
even look at you right now.

644
00:37:40,297 --> 00:37:43,232
I wanna know how many times
you banged him.

645
00:37:47,103 --> 00:37:49,571
Just tell me.

646
00:37:49,639 --> 00:37:51,402
Was it five?

647
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:55,535
- Ten, Twenty?
- God, stop!

648
00:37:59,015 --> 00:38:01,813
You forget that I know

649
00:38:01,885 --> 00:38:04,820
that you're not the kinda girl
that lets marriage stop you.

650
00:38:07,524 --> 00:38:09,856
You forget that I know
what kind of whore you are.

651
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,484
Oh, my God!

652
00:38:16,833 --> 00:38:20,667
Don't ever hold me down again!

653
00:38:29,446 --> 00:38:31,414
I can't do this anymore.

654
00:38:33,950 --> 00:38:37,283
We're done, Drew. It's over.

655
00:38:38,355 --> 00:38:40,823
You know you're
not going anywhere.

656
00:38:42,092 --> 00:38:46,654
Yeah. You're right.
I'm not going anywhere.

657
00:38:47,764 --> 00:38:49,925
You are. You're moving out.

658
00:38:52,769 --> 00:38:55,033
Kathleen was right about you.

659
00:38:55,805 --> 00:38:58,171
She was right about everything.

660
00:38:58,708 --> 00:39:00,903
I want you out!

661
00:39:00,977 --> 00:39:03,377
And if you don't go,

662
00:39:04,414 --> 00:39:07,542
I'm gonna make life
very difficult for you.

663
00:39:11,855 --> 00:39:14,790
And I know you know
exactly what I mean.

664
00:39:34,911 --> 00:39:36,503
I was an ass last night.

665
00:39:37,614 --> 00:39:41,550
A jealous, insecure ass.

666
00:39:42,452 --> 00:39:43,851
Yes, you were.

667
00:39:44,421 --> 00:39:46,582
I'm trying to say I'm sorry.

668
00:39:47,390 --> 00:39:49,153
I'm trying to make it better.

669
00:39:49,492 --> 00:39:52,461
Okay, well, you can't make it better.
Not anymore.

670
00:39:53,229 --> 00:39:55,424
But I know how much
you love these kids.

671
00:39:56,332 --> 00:39:58,197
You wouldn't
break up our family

672
00:39:58,334 --> 00:40:00,234
over one stupid fight, are you?

673
00:40:01,538 --> 00:40:03,665
One stupid fight, Drew?

674
00:40:06,042 --> 00:40:07,100
You're upset.

675
00:40:08,511 --> 00:40:11,878
Your sister died.
Just need a little time.

676
00:40:14,784 --> 00:40:17,014
You leaving is not an option.

677
00:40:25,328 --> 00:40:28,092
Four kids? Isn't that overkill?

678
00:40:28,231 --> 00:40:30,495
No. I love being a mom.

679
00:40:30,567 --> 00:40:33,092
It's amazing being a mom.

680
00:40:33,169 --> 00:40:35,899
I just need to not
be a wife anymore.

681
00:40:36,306 --> 00:40:38,536
Okay, but why call me?

682
00:40:38,608 --> 00:40:40,303
I mean, we dated
a really long time ago

683
00:40:40,376 --> 00:40:41,809
and I'm not into the kid thing.

684
00:40:41,878 --> 00:40:43,743
Don't flatter yourself.

685
00:40:43,813 --> 00:40:46,077
I'm not looking for a new guy.
No, I don't know.

686
00:40:46,149 --> 00:40:50,381
I guess I just needed to talk
to someone who knew me before.

687
00:40:51,721 --> 00:40:53,780
I used to be
really brave, right?

688
00:40:54,524 --> 00:40:57,322
Yeah. You climbed out of
the window of my truck

689
00:40:57,393 --> 00:40:59,588
to grab a beer out of
the cooler in the back,

690
00:40:59,662 --> 00:41:01,721
while we were
speeding on the highway.

691
00:41:01,798 --> 00:41:05,097
I was just trying to remember
what it felt like to be brave.

692
00:41:06,269 --> 00:41:08,203
And I remembered
you used to take me to the...

693
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:11,505
What?

694
00:41:16,146 --> 00:41:17,909
Is there a problem, Officer?

695
00:41:18,481 --> 00:41:19,641
Well, there's
definitely a problem

696
00:41:19,716 --> 00:41:20,808
if you're sleeping
with my wife.

697
00:41:21,151 --> 00:41:24,120
Whoa, whoa.
We're just having lunch here.

698
00:41:24,187 --> 00:41:27,213
Stop, there's nothing romantic here, okay?
He's just a friend.

699
00:41:27,490 --> 00:41:29,014
Then why didn't
you tell me about it?

700
00:41:31,928 --> 00:41:33,987
I'll leave you two alone. No,
no, you should eat your lunch.

701
00:41:34,063 --> 00:41:35,621
I'm not hungry.

702
00:41:38,735 --> 00:41:39,997
I said you should
eat your lunch.

703
00:41:40,136 --> 00:41:41,398
You can't do that.

704
00:41:42,705 --> 00:41:44,536
Who are you gonna call?

705
00:41:44,741 --> 00:41:46,368
My wife should
be able to go out,

706
00:41:47,277 --> 00:41:50,303
have a meal with a friend.

707
00:41:51,414 --> 00:41:53,041
So, eat up.

708
00:41:59,155 --> 00:42:01,214
You know we have to go back
for my car at some point.

709
00:42:01,291 --> 00:42:02,986
You can't keep my keys forever.

710
00:42:03,059 --> 00:42:05,220
I'm not keeping your keys,

711
00:42:05,295 --> 00:42:07,923
but I'm not gonna let you
drive when you're so upset.

712
00:42:07,997 --> 00:42:11,023
God, of course I was upset.
That was horrible!

713
00:42:11,134 --> 00:42:13,125
Our relationship
is not gonna work

714
00:42:13,269 --> 00:42:15,294
if you want to run
around with other guys.

715
00:42:15,905 --> 00:42:19,068
There is no relationship, Drew.
I just told you, we are done!

716
00:42:19,309 --> 00:42:21,436
I'm the one who
should be pissed off.

717
00:42:21,511 --> 00:42:23,741
You're running around
with a guy in secret,

718
00:42:23,813 --> 00:42:26,839
and I'm willing to forgive and forget,
but you gotta meet me halfway.

719
00:42:26,916 --> 00:42:28,440
All I have to do
is get a lawyer.

720
00:42:33,156 --> 00:42:35,750
I'm not gonna let that happen.

721
00:42:35,825 --> 00:42:39,556
I'm not gonna lose my wife,
my kids, and my house.

722
00:42:40,496 --> 00:42:41,793
I've worked too hard.

723
00:42:50,406 --> 00:42:54,433
Stacy, honey.
Hey, are you okay?

724
00:42:56,746 --> 00:43:00,273
He won't leave.
He's never gonna leave.

725
00:43:00,383 --> 00:43:01,748
Honey.

726
00:43:03,586 --> 00:43:06,316
Hey, listen to me.
Don't worry about him, okay?

727
00:43:06,389 --> 00:43:08,516
You can always leave.

728
00:43:09,993 --> 00:43:11,984
He won't let me go.

729
00:43:12,829 --> 00:43:15,525
He'll kill me
before he lets me go.

730
00:43:16,232 --> 00:43:17,494
What?

731
00:43:18,601 --> 00:43:21,661
Hey, did he threaten you?

732
00:43:22,672 --> 00:43:24,401
It doesn't matter.

733
00:43:25,608 --> 00:43:28,441
It does matter.
Yes, it matters. You matter.

734
00:43:29,946 --> 00:43:31,504
I'm already dead.

735
00:43:34,751 --> 00:43:36,719
I really needed to
speak with you, Pastor.

736
00:43:41,291 --> 00:43:43,156
I have to leave him.

737
00:43:44,394 --> 00:43:46,624
I have to end my marriage.

738
00:43:46,696 --> 00:43:49,563
I want you and Drew to come
in and talk to me, together.

739
00:43:49,632 --> 00:43:51,497
You don't understand.

740
00:43:52,468 --> 00:43:54,402
I'm terrified of him.

741
00:44:04,681 --> 00:44:06,148
Where are you going?

742
00:44:12,655 --> 00:44:15,988
I told Brianna I would help
paint her new apartment.

743
00:44:16,826 --> 00:44:18,453
But if you're gonna
lose it, I'm not gonna...

744
00:44:18,594 --> 00:44:20,221
Why would I lose it?

745
00:44:25,835 --> 00:44:26,927
You should go.

746
00:44:29,505 --> 00:44:30,972
What?

747
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:34,134
Go be with your sister.
It'll do you some good.

748
00:44:54,564 --> 00:44:55,588
Do you like it?

749
00:45:12,682 --> 00:45:14,843
So, the last time you saw Stacy

750
00:45:14,917 --> 00:45:17,078
was the morning of
October the 28th?

751
00:45:17,153 --> 00:45:18,211
Correct.

752
00:45:18,287 --> 00:45:20,152
Would you care to walk us through
the events of that morning?

753
00:45:20,890 --> 00:45:26,157
I had come home from the night
shift, and she was just waking up,

754
00:45:26,262 --> 00:45:29,720
and she told me that she was going
to paint her sister's house.

755
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,661
And you talked to her?

756
00:45:32,735 --> 00:45:35,295
I wished her a good day
and told her to have fun,

757
00:45:35,405 --> 00:45:40,399
and she left, I believe
around 11:30 in the morning.

758
00:45:41,110 --> 00:45:42,509
But you talked
to her after that?

759
00:45:43,613 --> 00:45:46,912
I got a call.
I was out running errands

760
00:45:46,983 --> 00:45:49,747
and she told me that
she'd found someone else

761
00:45:49,819 --> 00:45:52,811
and that she was leaving,
just like that.

762
00:45:53,523 --> 00:45:56,959
Hi. So, yes, of course I'm
gonna help you paint your apartment,

763
00:45:57,026 --> 00:45:58,357
I will be there by 10:00.

764
00:45:58,428 --> 00:46:01,522
But I just wanted you to know,
I think I'm gonna get a new phone.

765
00:46:01,597 --> 00:46:02,928
You know why.

766
00:46:02,999 --> 00:46:05,729
Okay. Talk to you in
a little bit. Love you.

767
00:46:08,571 --> 00:46:09,731
Do you know where Stacy is?

768
00:46:10,206 --> 00:46:12,299
No. But I've been
wondering about her,

769
00:46:12,375 --> 00:46:13,808
'cause she hadn't
been answering her cell.

770
00:46:13,876 --> 00:46:15,366
Yeah, I know. I've
been calling her all day,

771
00:46:15,445 --> 00:46:16,912
and I'm worried out of my mind.

772
00:46:31,194 --> 00:46:33,492
Where's Stacy?

773
00:46:34,597 --> 00:46:37,930
She didn't show up to paint with me today.
She won't answer her phone.

774
00:46:38,534 --> 00:46:39,694
What's going on, Drew?

775
00:46:41,370 --> 00:46:42,564
She left me.

776
00:46:46,409 --> 00:46:47,740
So she finally did it, huh?

777
00:46:49,612 --> 00:46:54,174
She called me on the phone, and she
said that she was with a new guy

778
00:46:54,951 --> 00:46:56,009
and she was leaving.

779
00:46:56,886 --> 00:46:59,411
No. Wait a minute.
Stacy wasn't seeing anyone.

780
00:46:59,655 --> 00:47:01,714
Did she tell you
she was seeing someone?

781
00:47:01,791 --> 00:47:03,986
Daddy,
when are we gonna eat?

782
00:47:04,627 --> 00:47:07,255
She left without the kids?

783
00:47:08,264 --> 00:47:10,824
Stacy? Stacy?

784
00:47:12,235 --> 00:47:13,702
Wait a minute.

785
00:47:13,769 --> 00:47:16,363
Stacy would not leave those kids behind.
I know her.

786
00:47:16,439 --> 00:47:17,872
Those kids are
everything to her.

787
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:19,305
She wouldn't leave them behind.

788
00:47:19,375 --> 00:47:20,501
That's what
I would have thought.

789
00:47:22,378 --> 00:47:24,573
But that's what she did.

790
00:47:24,647 --> 00:47:27,172
And I don't think
she's coming back.

791
00:47:29,552 --> 00:47:31,577
Stacy told me she'd
asked Drew to move out,

792
00:47:31,654 --> 00:47:34,555
and that she wanted a divorce
but he wouldn't agree to it.

793
00:47:36,259 --> 00:47:37,726
The thing is, she...

794
00:47:38,928 --> 00:47:40,122
She told me that
she thought that.

795
00:47:40,196 --> 00:47:41,993
Drew would kill her if
she ever tried to leave.

796
00:47:44,367 --> 00:47:45,994
I told you it was useless
to call the police.

797
00:47:46,769 --> 00:47:50,136
I don't work with Bolingbrook. I'm a
detective with the Illinois State Police.

798
00:47:50,206 --> 00:47:52,106
Prior to this morning, I've never
even met Sergeant Peterson.

799
00:47:52,174 --> 00:47:53,334
You'll still protect him.

800
00:47:53,776 --> 00:47:55,209
I can assure you both

801
00:47:55,278 --> 00:47:57,644
that we will investigate
this objectively.

802
00:47:57,947 --> 00:48:01,007
Stacy threatened to leave me
almost every month,

803
00:48:01,083 --> 00:48:05,247
sort of, you know, coordinated
around her menstrual cycle.

804
00:48:05,321 --> 00:48:08,051
You know,
so I'm kind of not surprised.

805
00:48:08,124 --> 00:48:12,754
But I'm sure she's laughing her ass off
now, with you guys coming after me.

806
00:48:14,330 --> 00:48:16,560
No one's coming
after you, Drew.

807
00:48:16,632 --> 00:48:17,997
I know these boys.

808
00:48:18,067 --> 00:48:19,830
They'll treat you
fair and square.

809
00:48:20,803 --> 00:48:22,065
It's very early.

810
00:48:22,138 --> 00:48:24,197
She's only been
missing 24 hours yet.

811
00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:26,474
But she's not.

812
00:48:26,542 --> 00:48:29,375
She's on a beach
somewhere with a new guy.

813
00:48:29,445 --> 00:48:32,972
Maybe she'll do you a favor and
call her sister sometime soon.

814
00:48:33,049 --> 00:48:36,576
I wouldn't hold my breath.
She likes seeing me squirm.

815
00:48:38,521 --> 00:48:42,685
Listen, I'm a police officer. I
understand you have a job to do.

816
00:48:42,758 --> 00:48:46,956
But I would really appreciate
some space. I mean...

817
00:48:48,331 --> 00:48:52,324
I just got left.
My kids just got left.

818
00:49:01,544 --> 00:49:04,138
So I take it
no one's found her yet.

819
00:49:12,288 --> 00:49:15,086
I love that girl so much.

820
00:49:17,727 --> 00:49:19,957
I really think
she might be dead.

821
00:49:20,029 --> 00:49:23,521
Sweetie, let's just hope you're wrong, okay?
Let's hope you're wrong.

822
00:49:24,066 --> 00:49:26,091
Oh, God, I hope I'm wrong.

823
00:49:27,003 --> 00:49:29,563
Stacy's friends and family
immediately called the police

824
00:49:29,639 --> 00:49:31,766
and said they thought
you had done something to her.

825
00:49:31,841 --> 00:49:33,069
That's right.
Did that surprise you?

826
00:49:33,209 --> 00:49:34,471
Not at all.

827
00:49:34,543 --> 00:49:36,374
You know,
whenever something happens

828
00:49:36,512 --> 00:49:39,379
the suspicion always
falls on the husband.

829
00:49:39,815 --> 00:49:42,841
If I were the investigating
officer, I'd feel the same way.

830
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:45,951
Joe, look alive. Yeah.

831
00:49:46,022 --> 00:49:48,149
Alive and kicking. No worries.

832
00:49:48,224 --> 00:49:49,987
Got a missing-persons
story for you.

833
00:49:50,059 --> 00:49:53,153
This young lady says her...
Sister?

834
00:49:53,329 --> 00:49:56,765
Her sister disappeared under
suspicious circumstances.

835
00:49:56,832 --> 00:50:00,097
If there's anything to it, I'll
need the story no later than 5:00.

836
00:50:01,437 --> 00:50:05,271
Sorry about that. Editors, they don't
always have the best bedside manner.

837
00:50:05,341 --> 00:50:08,640
I don't care. I just wanna find
out what happened to my sister.

838
00:50:08,711 --> 00:50:11,145
So, why are the
circumstances suspicious?

839
00:50:11,947 --> 00:50:13,539
I think her husband
did something to her.

840
00:50:14,016 --> 00:50:15,881
She has four little kids.

841
00:50:15,985 --> 00:50:19,011
He says she left them, but I
know she would never leave them.

842
00:50:19,255 --> 00:50:20,813
And what's your sister's name?

843
00:50:20,923 --> 00:50:22,151
Stacy Peterson.

844
00:50:24,326 --> 00:50:25,884
Her husband's Drew Peterson.

845
00:50:25,961 --> 00:50:28,862
He works for the police
department in Bolingbrook.

846
00:50:28,931 --> 00:50:30,766
Drew Peterson?

847
00:50:30,833 --> 00:50:32,357
Now to a mystery in Illinois.

848
00:50:32,435 --> 00:50:34,528
What happened to the wife
of a police sergeant

849
00:50:34,603 --> 00:50:36,195
who vanished over the weekend?

850
00:50:36,272 --> 00:50:38,103
She is his fourth wife.

851
00:50:38,174 --> 00:50:40,904
His last spouse died in
her home three years ago,

852
00:50:40,976 --> 00:50:42,273
and now investigators...

853
00:50:48,751 --> 00:50:50,275
Aberdeen.

854
00:50:50,352 --> 00:50:52,820
Joe. Just the man I need.

855
00:50:52,888 --> 00:50:54,412
Hosey will know.
He does his homework.

856
00:50:54,490 --> 00:50:55,650
Most of the time.

857
00:50:55,725 --> 00:50:57,192
The missing wife is the fourth wife?
Yeah.

858
00:50:57,493 --> 00:51:00,587
The third wife? Drowned in the
dry bathtub, so they say.

859
00:51:00,796 --> 00:51:03,230
I even talked to Peterson
at the last inquest.

860
00:51:03,966 --> 00:51:06,059
Wait a second. You know him?

861
00:51:06,135 --> 00:51:07,602
Well enough to get
me some face time?

862
00:51:07,670 --> 00:51:09,103
He's been
shooting all of us down.

863
00:51:10,239 --> 00:51:12,332
Well, then, I should go see
if he'll talk to me first.

864
00:51:18,681 --> 00:51:20,114
What do I got to do,
put a sign on the door?

865
00:51:20,182 --> 00:51:21,547
Drew doesn't
want to talk to you.

866
00:51:21,617 --> 00:51:23,778
I know, and I can't
say that I blame him.

867
00:51:23,853 --> 00:51:26,515
But I've interviewed him before,
and I quoted him accurately,

868
00:51:26,589 --> 00:51:29,683
so, if he wants to get
his side of the story out.

869
00:51:32,728 --> 00:51:34,355
I recognize you.

870
00:51:34,430 --> 00:51:36,898
You feel like telling me
what's up with your wife?

871
00:51:38,634 --> 00:51:40,329
Why not?

872
00:51:42,138 --> 00:51:44,129
There goes my new best friend.

873
00:51:46,041 --> 00:51:48,339
I was just making
the kids some eggs.

874
00:51:48,477 --> 00:51:50,809
I haven't made
breakfast in a while.

875
00:51:52,348 --> 00:51:54,612
Guess you'd better
get used to it now, huh?

876
00:51:54,683 --> 00:51:57,311
Just call me Mr. Mom
from now on.

877
00:51:57,787 --> 00:51:59,880
So, where do you
think your wife is, Drew?

878
00:52:00,456 --> 00:52:02,981
On a beach somewhere,
getting laid.

879
00:52:03,125 --> 00:52:04,251
I don't know.

880
00:52:04,326 --> 00:52:07,386
He's got crap luck for wives.
I'll tell you that much.

881
00:52:07,463 --> 00:52:08,794
You can say that.

882
00:52:08,864 --> 00:52:11,890
You know, where does she
put the whisks, huh?

883
00:52:11,967 --> 00:52:13,798
I spoke with Stacy's sister.

884
00:52:13,869 --> 00:52:17,896
I wouldn't do that.
She's always hated me.

885
00:52:17,973 --> 00:52:20,441
She told Stacy that
she'd regret marrying me.

886
00:52:20,509 --> 00:52:21,533
And did she?

887
00:52:24,246 --> 00:52:25,611
I guess she did at that.

888
00:52:27,116 --> 00:52:28,583
I've known Drew seven years.

889
00:52:28,784 --> 00:52:31,446
Okay? He's a good guy.
He's a great guy.

890
00:52:32,855 --> 00:52:34,482
I'll get it.

891
00:52:35,658 --> 00:52:37,091
You see,
it's times like this where

892
00:52:37,159 --> 00:52:38,524
you really know
who your friends are.

893
00:52:39,328 --> 00:52:41,819
He's the one who found your last
wife dead, in the bathtub, right?

894
00:52:41,897 --> 00:52:43,694
Correct. He had that honor.

895
00:52:45,267 --> 00:52:48,896
You do realize why all the
reporters are out there, right?

896
00:52:48,971 --> 00:52:51,132
Slow news day?

897
00:52:51,207 --> 00:52:52,504
A possible murder of
a beautiful young lady

898
00:52:52,575 --> 00:52:55,009
isn't exactly boring news.

899
00:52:55,077 --> 00:52:56,271
You know,
you have a lot of nerve

900
00:52:56,345 --> 00:52:58,245
coming in here and
talking to me like that.

901
00:52:58,314 --> 00:52:59,872
If she doesn't
show her face soon,

902
00:52:59,949 --> 00:53:02,713
a lot of people will say the
same thing, like the police.

903
00:53:03,352 --> 00:53:06,412
No, I don't think so. I mean,
those guys, they all know me.

904
00:53:06,722 --> 00:53:07,780
Drew?

905
00:53:10,526 --> 00:53:12,391
Sergeant Peterson,
we have a warrant

906
00:53:12,461 --> 00:53:15,021
allowing us to
search the premises.

907
00:53:19,602 --> 00:53:21,433
I guess I was wrong.

908
00:53:24,707 --> 00:53:28,268
Hi. The state boys
are searching my house,

909
00:53:28,644 --> 00:53:30,976
so I wondered if the kids
could come here for a minute.

910
00:53:31,380 --> 00:53:33,507
Absolutely.
You boys come on in.

911
00:53:33,983 --> 00:53:35,007
Thanks.

912
00:53:35,084 --> 00:53:36,984
Hey, kids, really take care of
the little ones for a minute

913
00:53:37,052 --> 00:53:39,953
so I can have
a little talk with Karen.

914
00:53:42,358 --> 00:53:46,692
Yeah. There's some popsicles in the freezer.
You boys can help yourself.

915
00:53:48,364 --> 00:53:50,696
Come on into my office.

916
00:53:50,766 --> 00:53:53,462
I thought we could talk
in here without the kids.

917
00:53:53,535 --> 00:53:56,698
They've heard all of this yammering.
They don't need it.

918
00:53:59,375 --> 00:54:02,538
Been a long time since
I banged a girl in a bathroom.

919
00:54:05,614 --> 00:54:09,573
Sorry. I'm probably just trying
to make light of things.

920
00:54:10,786 --> 00:54:11,844
Just tell me what you want.

921
00:54:12,554 --> 00:54:16,149
I want to thank you for being
so good with the kids.

922
00:54:17,226 --> 00:54:19,888
And hopefully
you can be around more,

923
00:54:20,029 --> 00:54:22,725
'cause it's hard now
with Stacy run off.

924
00:54:23,799 --> 00:54:25,699
Is that what you told them,
that she left them?

925
00:54:25,768 --> 00:54:28,134
No, I told them
that she's on vacation,

926
00:54:28,270 --> 00:54:30,670
and that I'm hoping
she comes back soon.

927
00:54:32,441 --> 00:54:34,170
Yeah. So do I.

928
00:54:36,178 --> 00:54:41,445
And I know that, you know,
you and Stacy were talking

929
00:54:42,384 --> 00:54:46,252
and I'm not gonna deny that we
didn't have our rough patch,

930
00:54:46,322 --> 00:54:47,346
but I love her.

931
00:54:48,958 --> 00:54:49,982
Okay.

932
00:54:52,328 --> 00:54:54,057
I mean, I'm pissed at her.

933
00:54:54,763 --> 00:54:57,323
I wish she'd show her face.

934
00:54:57,399 --> 00:55:01,096
But I love the girl.

935
00:55:04,606 --> 00:55:07,700
And I wouldn't do
nothing to hurt her.

936
00:55:09,712 --> 00:55:11,145
I'm gonna go check on the boys.

937
00:55:23,025 --> 00:55:25,858
Justin, honey,
didn't you want a Popsicle?

938
00:55:29,098 --> 00:55:31,965
Hey, sweetie, you okay?

939
00:55:32,901 --> 00:55:35,301
You know, he's gonna be fine.

940
00:55:39,842 --> 00:55:42,504
Sweetie, I know you're
worried about your mom.

941
00:55:42,578 --> 00:55:44,205
We all are.

942
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:47,478
But don't you worry. The police
are asking a lot of questions.

943
00:55:49,118 --> 00:55:52,178
Nobody should
talk to the police.

944
00:55:54,189 --> 00:55:57,215
No, honey, no. Listen to me.

945
00:55:57,292 --> 00:56:01,854
We should all talk to the police, all
of us, tell them everything you know.

946
00:56:06,802 --> 00:56:10,829
Stacy isn't the only wife of Drew
Peterson you should be talking about!

947
00:56:10,906 --> 00:56:15,536
This is my sister Kathleen's death
certificate, Drew's last wife.

948
00:56:15,611 --> 00:56:17,977
I've said all along that her
death wasn't an accident,

949
00:56:18,047 --> 00:56:20,413
but did anybody
listen to me? No!

950
00:56:20,482 --> 00:56:23,110
Are you listening to me now?
Ask yourself this question.

951
00:56:23,385 --> 00:56:26,081
- Ask the police this question.
- There he is.

952
00:56:26,155 --> 00:56:29,215
Why do bad things keep happening
to Drew Peterson's wives?

953
00:56:39,735 --> 00:56:42,533
Please, leave me alone.
Leave my little world alone.

954
00:56:42,604 --> 00:56:44,367
Leave my family alone.

955
00:56:51,013 --> 00:56:53,538
We are gonna start with
the search for Stacy Peterson,

956
00:56:53,615 --> 00:56:55,014
the young mother
from Illinois who

957
00:56:55,084 --> 00:56:56,711
has been missing
for two weeks now.

958
00:56:56,785 --> 00:57:00,482
Her husband, police sergeant Drew
Peterson, is now considered a suspect

959
00:57:00,556 --> 00:57:03,548
in what investigators have upgraded
from a missing-person case

960
00:57:03,625 --> 00:57:05,024
to a possible homicide.

961
00:57:05,094 --> 00:57:07,187
Hey, guys, come on in. Dinner's
almost ready. Come on.

962
00:57:07,830 --> 00:57:11,732
Grab your sister and clean up. Come
on, let's go, let's go, let's go.

963
00:57:14,336 --> 00:57:15,701
Thanks for picking
them up from practice.

964
00:57:15,771 --> 00:57:18,001
I'm trying not to go outside
with all those cameras.

965
00:57:18,774 --> 00:57:20,901
Look, Drew,
Justin must have asked me

966
00:57:20,976 --> 00:57:23,069
about 20 times,
"Where's Mommy?"

967
00:57:24,079 --> 00:57:26,809
Look, you gotta tell those kids
that Stacy's not coming back.

968
00:57:27,516 --> 00:57:29,916
But I don't know that
she's not coming back.

969
00:57:29,985 --> 00:57:32,954
I mean, she could get tired of
hanging out with what's-his-face.

970
00:57:33,021 --> 00:57:35,615
There is no what's-his-face,
and you know it.

971
00:57:35,724 --> 00:57:39,319
You see, the problem is that
you think that you know Stacy,

972
00:57:39,394 --> 00:57:42,591
but you only know the side
she wants you to see.

973
00:57:42,664 --> 00:57:45,724
I mean, I caught her having
lunch with some guy.

974
00:57:46,401 --> 00:57:50,167
She had lunch with some guy,
and she had to die for that?

975
00:57:50,239 --> 00:57:52,400
She had lunch with some guy,
and you made her disappear?

976
00:57:52,474 --> 00:57:53,839
Hey, you watch your mouth. No.

977
00:57:54,209 --> 00:57:56,473
'Cause I am sick of
going on with your little act.

978
00:57:56,612 --> 00:57:59,479
You and I both know that Stacy
didn't run off with someone.

979
00:58:00,082 --> 00:58:01,447
You did something to her.

980
00:58:01,517 --> 00:58:02,609
Get the hell out of my house.

981
00:58:02,684 --> 00:58:03,742
Don't you dare touch me!

982
00:58:04,086 --> 00:58:07,613
I will open that door, and 50
reporters will hear me scream.

983
00:58:08,590 --> 00:58:11,491
The true colors of a nasty
bitch come out eventually.

984
00:58:14,029 --> 00:58:17,089
I hope you had fun
visiting my kids,

985
00:58:17,166 --> 00:58:18,997
'cause you're never gonna
see them again. Get out.

986
00:58:29,211 --> 00:58:32,237
Round-the-clock searches have turned
up no sign of Stacy Peterson,

987
00:58:32,314 --> 00:58:33,542
and the police
have now declared

988
00:58:33,615 --> 00:58:36,140
the young mother's disappearance
a potential homicide.

989
00:58:47,796 --> 00:58:48,956
Go, go, go.

990
00:59:06,815 --> 00:59:09,750
I just got a tip that Peterson's
brother's in the hospital.

991
00:59:09,818 --> 00:59:11,308
Overdose.

992
00:59:21,997 --> 00:59:24,431
Glenn, Glenn, Glenn.

993
00:59:27,803 --> 00:59:29,270
You tried to kill yourself?

994
00:59:30,372 --> 00:59:31,999
You couldn't
even get that right.

995
00:59:33,242 --> 00:59:35,176
You know, you're like a chick.

996
00:59:35,978 --> 00:59:38,947
You got that little voice inside
your head just yammering away.

997
00:59:39,014 --> 00:59:41,505
Yammer, yammer.
You got to tell it to shut up.

998
00:59:43,051 --> 00:59:44,643
Be a man.

999
00:59:48,790 --> 00:59:51,850
And a real man, he never folds.

1000
00:59:54,062 --> 00:59:55,586
Ever.

1001
00:59:56,798 --> 00:59:56,863
Today, searchers in
Illinois are still.

1002
00:59:56,864 --> 00:59:58,594
Today, searchers in
Illinois are still

1003
00:59:58,667 --> 01:00:01,067
trying to find
23-year-old Stacy Peterson,

1004
01:00:01,136 --> 01:00:04,230
the police sergeant's wife who's
been missing since last month.

1005
01:00:04,306 --> 01:00:06,934
And now investigators are
taking an even closer look

1006
01:00:07,009 --> 01:00:09,409
at the death of the
sergeant's previous wife.

1007
01:00:09,478 --> 01:00:11,275
The latest from
NBC's Kevin Tibbles.

1008
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:14,938
Day 12, and the
search continues on foot,

1009
01:00:15,017 --> 01:00:18,180
on horseback,
even on all-terrain vehicles.

1010
01:00:18,253 --> 01:00:20,744
So, we're looking for volunteers
to help us search for Stacy,

1011
01:00:20,822 --> 01:00:24,588
and we want people to put up these
posters in their homes and businesses.

1012
01:00:25,527 --> 01:00:28,894
We're also selling these bumper
stickers, and people can buy them

1013
01:00:28,964 --> 01:00:31,091
and that's gonna help us
pay for the search efforts.

1014
01:00:31,233 --> 01:00:33,827
You think the police aren't
doing enough to find Stacy?

1015
01:00:34,503 --> 01:00:36,061
Well, we're not gonna give up.

1016
01:00:36,972 --> 01:00:38,701
And starting tomorrow,
people can meet us

1017
01:00:38,774 --> 01:00:40,503
at the Westside Community Church.
Somebody's coming out.

1018
01:00:40,575 --> 01:00:43,373
That's where we're gonna have
our staging area, and people...

1019
01:00:46,248 --> 01:00:47,272
Here he goes again.

1020
01:00:48,450 --> 01:00:50,384
Park in front of your house,
see how you guys like it.

1021
01:00:50,452 --> 01:00:53,250
Do you plan on joining
any searches to find her?

1022
01:00:54,656 --> 01:00:57,420
Wow. You are so hot.

1023
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:00,018
Isn't she hot?

1024
01:01:00,095 --> 01:01:01,926
Well, just hours
after state police

1025
01:01:01,997 --> 01:01:06,627
officially declared Peterson a
suspect in his wife's disappearance,

1026
01:01:06,702 --> 01:01:10,069
he continued his bizarre
dialog with the media.

1027
01:01:10,405 --> 01:01:12,236
As you can see here...

1028
01:01:13,008 --> 01:01:14,339
Hey!

1029
01:01:15,644 --> 01:01:18,135
Someone's jumpy today.

1030
01:01:18,914 --> 01:01:20,313
What are you doing here?

1031
01:01:20,382 --> 01:01:24,216
I got to talk to the captain.
Maybe he wants my autograph.

1032
01:01:25,120 --> 01:01:27,850
I've become
a media sensation now.

1033
01:01:30,492 --> 01:01:32,050
He's gonna suspend you,

1034
01:01:32,627 --> 01:01:34,561
without pay is what I hear.

1035
01:01:35,297 --> 01:01:36,423
Well, he's gotta do that.

1036
01:01:36,498 --> 01:01:38,466
He's gotta protect
the department from

1037
01:01:38,533 --> 01:01:40,467
all the B.S.
that's flying around.

1038
01:01:41,169 --> 01:01:43,228
I'm sure when it's over,
I'll be back.

1039
01:01:44,439 --> 01:01:46,066
There's something
else you don't know.

1040
01:01:46,708 --> 01:01:47,834
Lay it on me.

1041
01:01:50,011 --> 01:01:53,139
State boys got a court order
to exhume Kathleen.

1042
01:01:53,782 --> 01:01:55,773
They're gonna do
another autopsy on her.

1043
01:01:58,787 --> 01:02:00,687
Well,
that's a job you don't want,

1044
01:02:00,756 --> 01:02:03,520
digging up that corpse, been
in the ground all this time.

1045
01:02:06,161 --> 01:02:08,925
Yeah.
I think they ought to just.

1046
01:02:08,997 --> 01:02:10,897
Let her rest in peace,
you know?

1047
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:13,163
I mean, this thing's
getting out of hand.

1048
01:02:15,871 --> 01:02:17,133
I gotta go see the captain.

1049
01:02:17,939 --> 01:02:20,407
Hey, maybe I should
screw with him.

1050
01:02:21,376 --> 01:02:24,675
Maybe I should tell him I'm gonna
sue him for wrongful dismissal.

1051
01:02:26,748 --> 01:02:29,842
Really see the smoke
come outta his ears.

1052
01:02:35,891 --> 01:02:38,189
And finally, Drew,
what's life for you now?

1053
01:02:38,260 --> 01:02:42,094
I think my silence has painted
me guilty in the media.

1054
01:02:42,497 --> 01:02:47,196
I walk into a room and, you know,
you can hear that kind of hum

1055
01:02:47,903 --> 01:02:49,302
with the establishment.

1056
01:02:49,371 --> 01:02:50,497
"Drew Peterson's here."

1057
01:02:50,572 --> 01:02:53,200
"Drew Peterson, Drew
Peterson, Drew Peterson."

1058
01:02:55,277 --> 01:02:59,304
This isn't me. This is...
You know, I'm a jokester.

1059
01:02:59,815 --> 01:03:03,376
You know, I'm usually the
guy who's kidding around

1060
01:03:03,452 --> 01:03:06,421
and having
a good time, you know,

1061
01:03:06,488 --> 01:03:09,048
living life and
all that it brings.

1062
01:03:11,059 --> 01:03:12,321
Nineteen years.

1063
01:03:13,395 --> 01:03:16,796
Nineteen years on the force,
my wife runs off,

1064
01:03:16,865 --> 01:03:19,891
the media gets a hard-on,

1065
01:03:19,968 --> 01:03:22,732
and they show you
the door. Sayonara.

1066
01:03:22,804 --> 01:03:24,465
It's a raw deal.

1067
01:03:24,539 --> 01:03:25,733
That's exactly what it is.

1068
01:03:26,541 --> 01:03:28,839
Not that
I'm looking forward to it,

1069
01:03:28,910 --> 01:03:30,502
but it might be
a good thing to finally

1070
01:03:30,579 --> 01:03:32,137
sleep at nighttime
for a change.

1071
01:03:32,681 --> 01:03:34,114
So, this is
a good thing for you.

1072
01:03:34,416 --> 01:03:36,043
Well,
it'll be a legal nightmare.

1073
01:03:36,885 --> 01:03:38,978
I may have to sell
this to pay for a lawyer.

1074
01:03:39,187 --> 01:03:40,654
You haven't
gotten a lawyer yet?

1075
01:03:41,356 --> 01:03:43,119
Guy who hasn't done anything
wrong doesn't run to a lawyer.

1076
01:03:43,825 --> 01:03:45,190
You still think
Stacy's out there?

1077
01:03:45,627 --> 01:03:47,595
It's all
the information I have.

1078
01:03:47,662 --> 01:03:50,153
I mean, I think she's
where she wants to be.

1079
01:03:50,765 --> 01:03:54,223
I wish she'd pop her head up, put an
end to all this.

1080
01:03:55,170 --> 01:03:59,038
2-1-2. New York. Peterson.

1081
01:04:03,745 --> 01:04:06,179
It's The Today Show.
They wanna have me on.

1082
01:04:07,716 --> 01:04:09,946
Let's start with
NBC's Kevin Tibbles,

1083
01:04:10,018 --> 01:04:12,748
who has some new developments
in the investigation into

1084
01:04:12,821 --> 01:04:15,187
the death of Drew Peterson's
previous wife.

1085
01:04:15,257 --> 01:04:16,952
Kevin, good morning to you.

1086
01:04:17,392 --> 01:04:18,484
Good morning, Matt.

1087
01:04:18,560 --> 01:04:21,085
While Illinois State Police
continue to search for

1088
01:04:21,162 --> 01:04:23,653
the missing fourth
wife of Drew Peterson,

1089
01:04:23,732 --> 01:04:24,858
the state's attorney here

1090
01:04:24,933 --> 01:04:30,462
has had the body of his third wife
exhumed to perform another autopsy.

1091
01:04:46,788 --> 01:04:49,279
Hey, Joe, what's going on?
Did something happen?

1092
01:04:49,357 --> 01:04:51,188
Yeah. Something big.

1093
01:04:51,993 --> 01:04:53,255
The coroner's
office just released

1094
01:04:53,328 --> 01:04:55,296
a new autopsy
on Kathleen Savio.

1095
01:04:55,363 --> 01:04:57,126
They're saying that because of
all the bruises on her body,

1096
01:04:57,198 --> 01:04:59,462
she was the victim
of a forced drowning,

1097
01:04:59,534 --> 01:05:01,126
that she was murdered.

1098
01:05:05,373 --> 01:05:09,707
WXIR. Jay in the a.m. It's 8:25.
Good morning, Chicago.

1099
01:05:09,778 --> 01:05:12,372
Great to have you aboard. Hey,
special guest in the studio.

1100
01:05:12,447 --> 01:05:14,642
It's the notorious
Drew Peterson

1101
01:05:14,716 --> 01:05:18,049
who got booted from the Bolingbrook
Police Department last month!

1102
01:05:18,420 --> 01:05:19,409
Thanks, Jay.

1103
01:05:19,487 --> 01:05:22,320
Well, I'm just telling it like it is, my friend.
You can appreciate that.

1104
01:05:22,424 --> 01:05:24,824
No, it's fine. It's my motto.

1105
01:05:25,594 --> 01:05:28,358
Well, how are you doing
now that the police have said

1106
01:05:28,496 --> 01:05:31,590
maybe you've killed not only
one wife, but maybe two?

1107
01:05:32,267 --> 01:05:35,464
Well, they're trying
to make me sweat.

1108
01:05:35,537 --> 01:05:37,630
And you know, it's a game.

1109
01:05:37,706 --> 01:05:40,038
Now, wouldn't it be easier to
just say you bumped off your wife

1110
01:05:40,108 --> 01:05:41,575
than say she left
you for another dude?

1111
01:05:42,477 --> 01:05:44,035
Well, but that's what happened.

1112
01:05:44,112 --> 01:05:46,444
And Stacy was

1113
01:05:47,549 --> 01:05:50,450
irrational and a basket case.

1114
01:05:51,052 --> 01:05:55,113
She would ask me for a divorce every
month around her menstrual cycle.

1115
01:05:55,190 --> 01:05:56,521
I don't want to
hear about that.

1116
01:05:56,758 --> 01:05:59,283
Now, I tell you what,
I'm gonna sponsor a contest.

1117
01:05:59,361 --> 01:06:02,762
I am going to find you a woman
that will stick around.

1118
01:06:02,831 --> 01:06:06,528
In fact, let's call the contest
"Win A Date With Drew!"

1119
01:06:07,502 --> 01:06:08,730
What do you think?

1120
01:06:08,803 --> 01:06:10,771
That'll be fine.
I'd be up for that.

1121
01:06:10,839 --> 01:06:13,239
You're not worried about
no one entering the contest?

1122
01:06:13,308 --> 01:06:14,366
Because, let's face it,

1123
01:06:14,442 --> 01:06:17,036
all your wives don't have any
luck in the longevity department.

1124
01:06:17,212 --> 01:06:20,477
Well, if they get with me,
they're gonna get lucky.

1125
01:06:20,982 --> 01:06:22,142
As long as they're hot.

1126
01:06:22,217 --> 01:06:24,378
I'm not sure if we can find
anybody hot on the radio.

1127
01:06:24,452 --> 01:06:25,942
Tell you what, the phone
lines are burning up right now.

1128
01:06:26,021 --> 01:06:28,251
Let's take some calls. Let's
find you a date here, okay?

1129
01:06:28,490 --> 01:06:30,924
WXIR.
Back with more after this.

1130
01:06:31,693 --> 01:06:34,526
We have like 40 people
out here searching for Stacy.

1131
01:06:34,596 --> 01:06:36,188
Most of them
don't even know her.

1132
01:06:36,264 --> 01:06:38,198
So my question is,
where's her husband?

1133
01:06:38,266 --> 01:06:39,756
You know,
where the hell is Drew?

1134
01:06:39,834 --> 01:06:41,199
I don't know what
the police are doing

1135
01:06:41,269 --> 01:06:43,100
but they better start making him
answer some questions like,

1136
01:06:43,171 --> 01:06:45,036
"Why aren't you out here
looking for your wife,"

1137
01:06:45,106 --> 01:06:46,903
"the mother of your children?"

1138
01:06:46,975 --> 01:06:49,569
"You know, children who miss
their mother desperately?"

1139
01:06:50,078 --> 01:06:51,272
I mean, if you
think she's still alive,

1140
01:06:51,346 --> 01:06:53,541
then why aren't you
out here looking for her?

1141
01:06:54,115 --> 01:06:55,912
Drew, the Win
A Date With Drew contest

1142
01:06:55,984 --> 01:06:57,747
made all kinds
of news yesterday.

1143
01:06:57,819 --> 01:06:59,548
Is the dating
game gonna happen?

1144
01:06:59,621 --> 01:07:01,612
Well, hi.
How you doing? No, sir.

1145
01:07:01,690 --> 01:07:04,022
It looks like it's
not gonna happen.

1146
01:07:04,092 --> 01:07:06,083
And what was
the thinking behind that?

1147
01:07:06,261 --> 01:07:08,889
Well, it was all
part of a comedy bit

1148
01:07:08,963 --> 01:07:12,455
we were gonna do. It's all
meant to be in good nature.

1149
01:07:12,534 --> 01:07:15,594
And they were setting up
contestants for me

1150
01:07:15,704 --> 01:07:18,798
and they got so much heat over
it that they pulled the plug.

1151
01:07:18,873 --> 01:07:20,568
Drew, you seem so upbeat.

1152
01:07:20,642 --> 01:07:23,076
How is it that you
are able to stay upbeat

1153
01:07:23,144 --> 01:07:25,442
when your wife has been missing
for so many weeks now?

1154
01:07:25,613 --> 01:07:28,207
Well, you know,
you do what you can.

1155
01:07:28,817 --> 01:07:31,445
And I'm not gonna sit in a
corner and cry about it.

1156
01:07:33,188 --> 01:07:38,558
It's just like, you know, personally,
I grieve, but I do that all alone.

1157
01:07:38,626 --> 01:07:39,786
And what about your kids?

1158
01:07:39,861 --> 01:07:41,692
How are they feeling
about the disappearance

1159
01:07:41,763 --> 01:07:42,923
and what do they
think of the fact

1160
01:07:42,997 --> 01:07:44,123
that you have
been named a suspect

1161
01:07:44,199 --> 01:07:45,461
in a potential homicide?

1162
01:07:45,533 --> 01:07:48,502
Well, the little ones are sad.
They miss their mom.

1163
01:07:48,570 --> 01:07:51,437
But, you know, I guess this isn't
what I agreed to talk about.

1164
01:07:51,506 --> 01:07:54,031
I didn't agree on any
restrictions on conversation.

1165
01:07:54,109 --> 01:07:55,167
In fact, I'd never do that.

1166
01:07:55,243 --> 01:07:57,234
Well, then,
I guess I have to walk away.

1167
01:07:57,312 --> 01:07:59,109
It's been nice talking to you.
Have a good day.

1168
01:08:02,250 --> 01:08:03,512
Well, there you have it.

1169
01:08:03,585 --> 01:08:07,681
Drew Peterson, not willing to talk
about his wife's disappearance

1170
01:08:07,756 --> 01:08:10,418
but willing to talk
about the dating game.

1171
01:08:11,593 --> 01:08:14,187
Whoa, whoa, wait.
So there's no dating game?

1172
01:08:14,496 --> 01:08:16,726
Now how are you gonna get laid?

1173
01:08:16,798 --> 01:08:18,993
You think I need a stupid
radio program for that?

1174
01:08:19,300 --> 01:08:21,268
Come on.
Drew's gotten more tail than

1175
01:08:21,336 --> 01:08:23,270
anybody in this
entire bar combined.

1176
01:08:23,505 --> 01:08:25,439
He doubts my charismatic power.

1177
01:08:34,482 --> 01:08:36,074
Big Daddy's gonna get it done.

1178
01:08:36,584 --> 01:08:38,313
Oh, I get a demonstration.

1179
01:08:43,758 --> 01:08:44,952
Sorry.
I don't mean to interrupt.

1180
01:08:45,460 --> 01:08:47,018
He likes them young,
doesn't he?

1181
01:08:47,095 --> 01:08:48,357
And they go for him, too, man.

1182
01:08:50,031 --> 01:08:51,328
He studies their body language.

1183
01:08:52,033 --> 01:08:54,228
He can tell when
a girl's insecure.

1184
01:08:54,803 --> 01:08:57,067
He picks the ones that grew
up in messed-up situations

1185
01:08:57,138 --> 01:08:59,572
and are all
desperate for security.

1186
01:09:00,241 --> 01:09:02,106
Still, I don't get why
hot chicks go for him.

1187
01:09:02,177 --> 01:09:03,838
I know. It's weird.

1188
01:09:03,912 --> 01:09:06,403
The guy is an arrogant,
misogynistic ass,

1189
01:09:06,481 --> 01:09:08,915
and yet I have fun
hanging around him.

1190
01:09:11,286 --> 01:09:12,719
Yeah, don't tell Drew
I said that.

1191
01:09:12,787 --> 01:09:16,223
Although if I did say it to his
face, he would probably just laugh.

1192
01:09:20,762 --> 01:09:24,391
I think I may have
found wife number five.

1193
01:09:26,534 --> 01:09:27,523
Told you.

1194
01:09:27,602 --> 01:09:29,661
The strange case of
missing mom Stacy Peterson

1195
01:09:29,737 --> 01:09:30,931
has just gotten
a little stranger.

1196
01:09:31,005 --> 01:09:33,974
Her husband, Drew, who police
call a suspect in the case,

1197
01:09:34,042 --> 01:09:36,704
is now apparently lonely
and looking for love.

1198
01:09:37,478 --> 01:09:40,072
Just months after the
disappearance of his last wife,

1199
01:09:40,148 --> 01:09:41,809
Drew Peterson has
announced to the world

1200
01:09:41,883 --> 01:09:44,181
that he is engaged
to be married again

1201
01:09:44,252 --> 01:09:46,049
to single mother Chloe Roberts.

1202
01:09:46,354 --> 01:09:50,290
Peterson invited cameras inside
his home to meet his new fianc.

1203
01:09:50,758 --> 01:09:52,953
Miss Roberts is
just 23 years old,

1204
01:09:53,027 --> 01:09:56,428
the same age as Stacy Peterson
when she disappeared last October.

1205
01:09:56,965 --> 01:10:00,526
When asked about the cloud of suspicion
hanging over her new fianc,

1206
01:10:00,602 --> 01:10:03,002
Miss Roberts expressed
disbelief in the allegations.

1207
01:10:03,705 --> 01:10:08,369
No, I don't think he hurt Stacy.
I know him. He's a good dad.

1208
01:10:08,476 --> 01:10:11,707
He's got a real good heart,
and he'd never hurt anyone.

1209
01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:13,377
So you
feel safe with him?

1210
01:10:13,448 --> 01:10:15,006
Yes, of course.

1211
01:10:16,050 --> 01:10:18,450
I'm moving in with
him this weekend.

1212
01:10:19,387 --> 01:10:20,513
This single mother...

1213
01:10:20,588 --> 01:10:22,078
It's like a lamb to slaughter.

1214
01:10:23,024 --> 01:10:26,118
I got a call from some
producer in Las Vegas.

1215
01:10:26,194 --> 01:10:30,187
I guess they're making a movie
about a whorehouse or something.

1216
01:10:30,899 --> 01:10:34,130
They want me to play a security
guard, keep the Johns in line.

1217
01:10:34,202 --> 01:10:36,295
Nice.
How perfect would that be?

1218
01:10:39,874 --> 01:10:41,034
Why is she doing that?

1219
01:10:44,145 --> 01:10:45,942
Don't pay any attention
to her. She's nuts.

1220
01:10:46,014 --> 01:10:48,244
I sure hope I don't have to put
up a sign for you one day.

1221
01:10:48,316 --> 01:10:50,978
Don't talk to my girlfriend.
Stay outta my life.

1222
01:10:51,052 --> 01:10:53,680
I'm in your life until the world
finds out what happened to Stacy,

1223
01:10:54,122 --> 01:10:55,783
so get used to it!

1224
01:11:02,030 --> 01:11:03,497
I know Stacy
used to come here.

1225
01:11:03,965 --> 01:11:06,490
She used to say
the nicest things about you.

1226
01:11:08,336 --> 01:11:11,271
Look, I was thinking that you might
want to sponsor a fundraiser.

1227
01:11:11,339 --> 01:11:13,466
We still do searches
for her every Saturday.

1228
01:11:13,741 --> 01:11:15,902
The media's not interested
in Stacy anymore, you know.

1229
01:11:15,977 --> 01:11:18,912
All they want to talk about is
Drew and his new girlfriend.

1230
01:11:18,980 --> 01:11:21,847
Yes, I saw that.
Very disturbing.

1231
01:11:24,185 --> 01:11:25,277
What?

1232
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:30,357
Stacy confided in me
something about her husband,

1233
01:11:31,993 --> 01:11:34,860
and it's weighing very
heavily on me what to do,

1234
01:11:35,964 --> 01:11:38,455
whether to go to the police.

1235
01:11:41,302 --> 01:11:43,167
It was Drew's night off.

1236
01:11:44,605 --> 01:11:46,732
We went to bed together.

1237
01:11:46,808 --> 01:11:50,539
But when I woke up in the middle
of the night, he was gone.

1238
01:11:51,379 --> 01:11:54,473
I heard him come in,
so I went downstairs to see,

1239
01:11:56,951 --> 01:11:59,351
and he was putting
clothes in the wash.

1240
01:12:00,254 --> 01:12:02,484
He never did laundry. Never.

1241
01:12:03,591 --> 01:12:05,923
That doesn't mean
that he hurt her.

1242
01:12:07,862 --> 01:12:09,386
When they found
Kathleen's body,

1243
01:12:09,464 --> 01:12:12,490
I asked him where he
had been that night,

1244
01:12:14,168 --> 01:12:16,329
and he said, "You know
exactly where I was."

1245
01:12:17,472 --> 01:12:19,406
I was so upset.

1246
01:12:20,441 --> 01:12:24,309
But then the autopsy came back an accident.
I thought, "Oh, thank God."

1247
01:12:27,615 --> 01:12:29,583
It wasn't an accident.

1248
01:12:32,186 --> 01:12:34,211
Drew killed Kathleen,

1249
01:12:35,623 --> 01:12:38,820
and I think I helped
him get away with it.

1250
01:12:38,893 --> 01:12:41,418
And now I think
he's gonna kill me.

1251
01:12:53,808 --> 01:12:55,366
You never call.
You never write.

1252
01:12:55,443 --> 01:12:58,742
Work's been busy.
It's about to get busier.

1253
01:12:58,813 --> 01:13:01,941
There's a big Drew-and-Stacy
story that's about to break.

1254
01:13:02,016 --> 01:13:04,075
Thought you might
like a heads-up.

1255
01:13:04,185 --> 01:13:05,447
You mean you thought
you'd come here

1256
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:07,579
and try to get a quote from
me before anybody else.

1257
01:13:07,655 --> 01:13:08,747
I'd take a few quotes.

1258
01:13:09,724 --> 01:13:11,624
All right. What's going on?

1259
01:13:11,692 --> 01:13:14,718
Stacy's pastor is gonna be on
Greta Van Susteren tonight.

1260
01:13:15,663 --> 01:13:18,461
He'll be saying that Stacy
told him you killed Kathleen.

1261
01:13:24,405 --> 01:13:25,838
Chloe.

1262
01:13:26,507 --> 01:13:28,134
Chloe, come on!

1263
01:13:29,811 --> 01:13:32,507
All of the things they say
about me, all of the things,

1264
01:13:32,580 --> 01:13:35,743
and you're gonna let
this one thing bother you?

1265
01:13:36,851 --> 01:13:38,580
I can't deal with it anymore.

1266
01:13:38,653 --> 01:13:41,053
You got to ignore it.
It's part of a game.

1267
01:13:41,656 --> 01:13:43,647
I don't want to
play this game anymore.

1268
01:13:43,724 --> 01:13:46,215
I told you I didn't want to go
on TV, and you made me do it.

1269
01:13:46,294 --> 01:13:47,318
You told me it was fun.

1270
01:13:47,395 --> 01:13:51,297
Everyone I know thinks
I'm pathetic and stupid.

1271
01:13:51,365 --> 01:13:53,128
I mean,
I let you cast a spell on me.

1272
01:13:53,401 --> 01:13:56,268
I don't know how you do it, but
I can't be this stupid anymore.

1273
01:13:57,972 --> 01:13:59,530
Do you know what's stupid?

1274
01:14:01,809 --> 01:14:03,367
What would be stupid
would be to let go of

1275
01:14:03,444 --> 01:14:05,173
all of the good that we've got.

1276
01:14:06,214 --> 01:14:08,079
Drew, you're scaring me.

1277
01:14:08,149 --> 01:14:10,140
No, I am the one who's scared,

1278
01:14:10,218 --> 01:14:12,618
because you made me
fall in love with you,

1279
01:14:12,687 --> 01:14:14,746
and now you're
ripping my heart out.

1280
01:14:14,822 --> 01:14:16,153
Everything all right?

1281
01:14:19,260 --> 01:14:20,318
I have to go.

1282
01:14:26,901 --> 01:14:30,302
At a time when the body of Drew
Peterson's third wife has been exhumed

1283
01:14:30,371 --> 01:14:33,636
comes a stunning announcement today
from Stacy Peterson's pastor.

1284
01:14:33,708 --> 01:14:35,198
The pastor has
come forward with

1285
01:14:35,276 --> 01:14:37,107
allegations that
Stacy confided in him

1286
01:14:37,178 --> 01:14:39,806
her fears of being
murdered by her own husband.

1287
01:14:39,881 --> 01:14:42,042
The body of Kathleen
Savio was found in...

1288
01:15:12,580 --> 01:15:14,070
Where'd you get that opener?

1289
01:15:16,117 --> 01:15:17,709
Give it back to me.

1290
01:15:17,785 --> 01:15:19,514
I don't think so.

1291
01:15:22,023 --> 01:15:24,014
Fine. I'll just
change the code tomorrow.

1292
01:15:24,091 --> 01:15:26,184
Do you think
that would stop me?

1293
01:15:26,594 --> 01:15:28,619
Going to prison's
gonna stop you.

1294
01:15:30,164 --> 01:15:31,654
I'm not going anywhere.

1295
01:15:34,035 --> 01:15:35,730
I'm untouchable, bitch.

1296
01:15:45,646 --> 01:15:47,170
Tonight, exclusive.

1297
01:15:47,548 --> 01:15:50,745
His fourth wife
disappeared without a trace.

1298
01:15:50,818 --> 01:15:53,309
His third wife ended up
dead in a bathtub.

1299
01:15:53,387 --> 01:15:56,447
And now Drew Peterson
is in the hot seat.

1300
01:15:57,225 --> 01:16:00,251
Let's get to it right
now on Larry King Live.

1301
01:16:05,833 --> 01:16:08,324
We welcome to Larry King
Live here in Los Angeles.

1302
01:16:08,402 --> 01:16:10,165
Drew Peterson,
who is a suspect in

1303
01:16:10,238 --> 01:16:12,672
the disappearance of
his fourth wife, Stacy,

1304
01:16:12,740 --> 01:16:15,208
and still a question mark over
the death of his third wife.

1305
01:16:15,276 --> 01:16:16,300
Why'd you come here, Drew?

1306
01:16:16,544 --> 01:16:17,943
I wanted to talk to you

1307
01:16:18,012 --> 01:16:21,277
and maybe clear up some
misconceptions in the public.

1308
01:16:21,349 --> 01:16:23,510
Are you in love with Stacy?
Very much so.

1309
01:16:24,018 --> 01:16:26,851
A lot of people
believe that Stacy is dead.

1310
01:16:26,954 --> 01:16:28,216
Think she might be alive?

1311
01:16:28,656 --> 01:16:29,645
I do.

1312
01:16:29,991 --> 01:16:31,424
Drew, you're a bright guy.

1313
01:16:31,492 --> 01:16:33,323
Do you begin to
think that the public

1314
01:16:33,394 --> 01:16:35,362
might say that if
it looks like a duck

1315
01:16:35,429 --> 01:16:38,159
and it acts like a duck,
it might be a duck?

1316
01:16:38,232 --> 01:16:40,700
Well, they don't have all
of the duck's information.

1317
01:16:40,768 --> 01:16:43,703
Because if they knew the facts
about me they would know

1318
01:16:43,771 --> 01:16:46,934
that there's no way that I could
be involved in any crime.

1319
01:16:47,008 --> 01:16:49,943
Head to CNN.corn/LarryKing
and weigh in.

1320
01:16:50,011 --> 01:16:53,071
Do you think Stacy Peterson is dead?
We'll be back after the break.

1321
01:16:57,852 --> 01:17:00,548
What do you get when you
cross a pig with the media?

1322
01:17:01,255 --> 01:17:03,815
Nothing, 'cause there's
some things a pig won't do.

1323
01:17:04,959 --> 01:17:08,451
You know, every day I come out
here, there's more flowers,

1324
01:17:08,529 --> 01:17:11,828
cards from California, Kansas.

1325
01:17:17,104 --> 01:17:18,765
Oh, God.

1326
01:17:20,241 --> 01:17:23,108
You think I would
have accepted it by now.

1327
01:17:24,779 --> 01:17:26,110
What could you
have done different?

1328
01:17:27,048 --> 01:17:28,640
I don't know.

1329
01:17:31,986 --> 01:17:34,250
I should've gone over there when
I knew something was wrong.

1330
01:17:43,931 --> 01:17:46,024
Why'd they come back?

1331
01:17:46,934 --> 01:17:50,495
The same old story,
telling lies about me.

1332
01:17:52,540 --> 01:17:55,703
They really think you
killed Stacy, don't they?

1333
01:17:57,144 --> 01:18:00,375
The only thing that matters
is that you know the truth.

1334
01:18:01,215 --> 01:18:03,410
And you know the truth,
don't you?

1335
01:18:04,318 --> 01:18:05,751
That's right.

1336
01:18:06,687 --> 01:18:10,248
Glenn, come on. You've got to
start answering your phone.

1337
01:18:10,324 --> 01:18:12,087
All right,
I can't have you out there.

1338
01:18:12,159 --> 01:18:14,457
Losing your little
mind again. All right?

1339
01:18:14,528 --> 01:18:17,292
And I don't want you talking
to those state police guys.

1340
01:18:17,365 --> 01:18:19,333
They're idiots, okay?

1341
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:22,267
They're gonna bungle this, and
there's no reason to talk to them.

1342
01:18:22,336 --> 01:18:24,770
So call me.
And, remember, we're family.

1343
01:18:34,181 --> 01:18:36,172
Illinois State Police,
Detective Franklin.

1344
01:18:57,405 --> 01:18:59,896
I remember you and Stacy
at your wedding.

1345
01:19:01,108 --> 01:19:02,769
Happy as clams.

1346
01:19:04,145 --> 01:19:07,672
And I thought, "Man, they
might actually make it."

1347
01:19:09,784 --> 01:19:11,843
I always knew
this day was coming.

1348
01:19:14,288 --> 01:19:17,348
Still, cheating on you,
that don't seem like her.

1349
01:19:17,858 --> 01:19:20,292
That's exactly like her.

1350
01:19:23,597 --> 01:19:26,691
And I know that
we're not blood brothers,

1351
01:19:28,502 --> 01:19:29,969
but I always felt
that you and I were

1352
01:19:30,037 --> 01:19:32,369
closer than some real brothers.

1353
01:19:32,606 --> 01:19:36,599
Yeah, I mean,
you know I love you.

1354
01:19:38,112 --> 01:19:40,979
Would you love me if you
thought I killed someone?

1355
01:19:45,319 --> 01:19:47,014
I guess I would, I mean...

1356
01:19:49,089 --> 01:19:53,321
I kinda always
thought you killed.

1357
01:19:54,929 --> 01:19:56,226
Kathleen.

1358
01:20:04,472 --> 01:20:06,565
This is my phone.

1359
01:20:06,640 --> 01:20:08,505
I want you to hold on to it,

1360
01:20:09,076 --> 01:20:11,169
but I do not want
you to answer it.

1361
01:20:11,812 --> 01:20:13,177
All right?

1362
01:20:15,916 --> 01:20:17,508
I want you to help
me move something.

1363
01:20:46,514 --> 01:20:48,448
Do we need gloves?

1364
01:20:49,950 --> 01:20:51,008
No.

1365
01:21:10,771 --> 01:21:10,802
Meredith, thank you.

1366
01:21:10,803 --> 01:21:11,771
Meredith, thank you.

1367
01:21:11,839 --> 01:21:15,002
Now to some potentially major
developments in the Stacy Peterson case.

1368
01:21:15,075 --> 01:21:17,737
Two Chicago newspapers
are reporting this morning

1369
01:21:17,811 --> 01:21:19,403
that a relative
of Drew Peterson

1370
01:21:19,480 --> 01:21:23,143
may have unwittingly helped
remove her body from their home.

1371
01:21:23,217 --> 01:21:26,345
NBC's Kevin Tibbles has the latest on that.
Hi, Kevin. Good morning.

1372
01:21:27,187 --> 01:21:29,052
Startling revelations
this morning, Matt,

1373
01:21:29,356 --> 01:21:32,484
that a relative of Drew Peterson
allegedly told a friend

1374
01:21:32,560 --> 01:21:34,221
he helped Peterson carry a...

1375
01:21:34,295 --> 01:21:35,626
...disappearance
of Stacy Peterson.

1376
01:21:35,696 --> 01:21:38,426
The young Illinois mother
vanished last October,

1377
01:21:38,499 --> 01:21:40,490
and her husband
remains a suspect.

1378
01:21:47,508 --> 01:21:49,601
He is the Romeo who
was either extremely

1379
01:21:49,677 --> 01:21:51,736
unlucky with women
or something worse.

1380
01:21:51,812 --> 01:21:53,803
...that Drew did
something to my sister.

1381
01:21:53,881 --> 01:21:56,543
This is just more proof, and I
think they should arrest him.

1382
01:21:56,784 --> 01:21:59,878
Illinois police sergeant Drew
Peterson has been named a suspect

1383
01:21:59,954 --> 01:22:02,548
in her disappearance and is
now under renewed scrutiny

1384
01:22:02,623 --> 01:22:04,215
in the death of
his previous wife.

1385
01:22:04,291 --> 01:22:05,485
How much more do
the police need

1386
01:22:05,559 --> 01:22:07,493
before they move in
to make an arrest?

1387
01:22:07,561 --> 01:22:09,051
They have his
stepbrother saying...

1388
01:22:09,129 --> 01:22:10,994
"I helped carry Stacy's
body out of the house."

1389
01:22:11,065 --> 01:22:12,623
Stacy told me she
was afraid of him.

1390
01:22:12,700 --> 01:22:14,224
She was afraid that
he would kill her.

1391
01:22:14,368 --> 01:22:15,665
She said to me,
"I'm already dead,"

1392
01:22:15,803 --> 01:22:17,134
and those were her exact words.

1393
01:22:17,237 --> 01:22:19,899
If anything happened to her,
it's because he killed her.

1394
01:22:19,974 --> 01:22:21,498
And he'll make it
look like an accident.

1395
01:22:21,642 --> 01:22:24,440
And I think they should arrest him.
He needs to be arrested.

1396
01:22:24,578 --> 01:22:26,512
He killed her. She was
afraid that he was gonna kill her.

1397
01:22:26,647 --> 01:22:28,547
He held me down... She
said to me, "I'm dead already."

1398
01:22:28,616 --> 01:22:29,605
...and put his
hands around my neck.

1399
01:22:29,683 --> 01:22:31,583
He should be locked up.
He needs to be arrested.

1400
01:22:31,652 --> 01:22:33,210
I was already dead.
The guy's dangerous.

1401
01:22:33,287 --> 01:22:34,379
He killed her. Killer.

1402
01:22:50,704 --> 01:22:54,367
Zach, I need you to watch the gang.
I got to go buy some luggage.

1403
01:22:55,075 --> 01:22:57,305
Daddy's headed to
Vegas to be a TV star.

1404
01:22:57,778 --> 01:22:59,871
I thought you were
already a TV star.

1405
01:22:59,947 --> 01:23:03,007
Well, I'm a media sensation,
but there's no money in that.

1406
01:23:03,083 --> 01:23:06,348
You're only a star when
they pay you to be on TV.

1407
01:23:13,127 --> 01:23:14,321
Please, just answer
one quick question.

1408
01:23:14,395 --> 01:23:15,555
Over here, Drew, over here.

1409
01:23:15,629 --> 01:23:17,961
You're wasting your time, guys.

1410
01:23:18,032 --> 01:23:20,330
I'm not leaving for
Vegas till tomorrow.

1411
01:23:24,371 --> 01:23:26,202
We better go catch up.

1412
01:23:32,513 --> 01:23:35,004
This is it, Karen, the day
you've been waiting for.

1413
01:23:51,832 --> 01:23:55,598
Get out of the car and put
your hands where I can see them.

1414
01:24:00,574 --> 01:24:02,474
Drew Peterson, I have a
warrant for your arrest

1415
01:24:02,543 --> 01:24:04,408
for the murder
of Kathleen Savio.

1416
01:24:05,279 --> 01:24:07,144
I guess I should have
returned those library books.

1417
01:24:07,214 --> 01:24:08,806
Hey, Drew! What do you
have to say now, Drew?

1418
01:24:09,283 --> 01:24:13,447
Guys, make sure you get my good side.
Have a look at my new bling.

1419
01:24:13,520 --> 01:24:15,010
You have the right
to remain silent.

1420
01:24:15,089 --> 01:24:16,556
Anything you say
can and will be

1421
01:24:16,623 --> 01:24:18,056
used against you
in a court of law.

1422
01:24:18,125 --> 01:24:19,353
You have
the right to an attorney.

1423
01:24:19,426 --> 01:24:21,826
If you cannot afford an attorney,
one will be appointed for you.

1424
01:24:23,230 --> 01:24:24,322
Beginning with
breaking news in Illinois.

1425
01:24:24,398 --> 01:24:26,593
Former police sergeant Drew
Peterson has been indicted

1426
01:24:26,667 --> 01:24:28,760
in the murder of his third
wife, Kathleen Savio,

1427
01:24:28,836 --> 01:24:31,236
and he was arrested hours ago
during this traffic stop.

1428
01:24:31,305 --> 01:24:33,535
Peterson also remains the prime
suspect in the disappearance

1429
01:24:33,607 --> 01:24:35,199
of his fourth wife,
Stacy Peterson.

1430
01:24:36,310 --> 01:24:38,210
1400 hours commence rec...

1431
01:24:38,278 --> 01:24:41,145
I was gonna be
state police myself,

1432
01:24:41,215 --> 01:24:43,206
till I found out that
my mother and father

1433
01:24:43,283 --> 01:24:46,616
would also have to be brother
and sister, so ruled me out.

1434
01:24:47,321 --> 01:24:50,188
You know the drill,
Mr. Peterson. Strip.

1435
01:24:52,426 --> 01:24:53,484
See, now I get it.

1436
01:24:54,394 --> 01:24:56,362
You just want to have
a look at my package.

1437
01:24:57,631 --> 01:24:58,655
Well, I can make that happen.

1438
01:25:00,167 --> 01:25:01,498
No problem.
