1
00:03:43,257 --> 00:03:44,356
Hawk.

2
00:04:30,703 --> 00:04:32,037
Ah, shit.

3
00:04:34,474 --> 00:04:36,742
Goddamn sumbitches.

4
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:41,680
The sumbitch got
shit for brains.

5
00:04:47,387 --> 00:04:48,754
You seen coulter?

6
00:04:48,756 --> 00:04:49,655
Nope.

7
00:04:52,692 --> 00:04:54,293
Listen up!

8
00:04:54,295 --> 00:04:55,827
When them plews is cleaned,

9
00:04:55,829 --> 00:04:58,597
I want you to hoop
'em up real tight.

10
00:04:58,599 --> 00:05:02,467
Remember, we're not doing
no 15-pelt bales!

11
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:04,303
- We're going 30-pelt bales!
- Fitzgerald!

12
00:05:04,937 --> 00:05:06,571
Cap'n.

13
00:05:06,573 --> 00:05:09,041
Where are we with the haul?
What are you thinking?

14
00:05:11,344 --> 00:05:13,712
I'm thinking, whatever it is
they're hunting out there...

15
00:05:13,714 --> 00:05:15,747
...i hope it don't need
another shot.

16
00:05:15,749 --> 00:05:17,716
Make sure we're ready
to head out by dawn.

17
00:05:17,718 --> 00:05:18,850
Been done by this morning.

18
00:05:18,852 --> 00:05:20,452
I'd have liked
to be out by how,

19
00:05:20,454 --> 00:05:22,587
but the men are too tired.

20
00:05:22,589 --> 00:05:23,889
We're only a few days
from the fort.

21
00:05:23,891 --> 00:05:25,657
We're trapped out.

22
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:27,726
All we have to worry
about is fresh meat
for the boys.

23
00:05:28,928 --> 00:05:31,463
Well, you, uh, seen coulter?

24
00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:36,835
Hey, we took down
an elk. A big one.

25
00:05:38,104 --> 00:05:39,971
We need help
to haul the meat back.

26
00:05:39,973 --> 00:05:41,606
Let me know
when it's on the spit.

27
00:05:41,608 --> 00:05:42,874
I'll help you
with it then.

28
00:05:42,876 --> 00:05:45,010
Come on, I need your help.

29
00:05:45,012 --> 00:05:47,779
We needed help when we
were loading them bales.

30
00:05:47,781 --> 00:05:50,749
I been eating this damn
beaver meat so long...

31
00:05:50,751 --> 00:05:52,818
...I'm starting to
miss my wife's cooking.

32
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,486
I'm starting
to miss your wife.

33
00:05:54,488 --> 00:05:55,654
Shut up.

34
00:05:55,656 --> 00:05:56,688
Help!

35
00:05:57,724 --> 00:05:59,591
Help.

36
00:05:59,593 --> 00:06:01,126
Is that coulter?

37
00:06:01,128 --> 00:06:03,428
You go get the captain.

38
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:04,463
Jesus Christ.

39
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:09,935
Anybody see them?

40
00:06:09,937 --> 00:06:11,470
Stay quiet.

41
00:06:11,472 --> 00:06:12,671
Watch the Ridge.

42
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:56,782
They got Thomas.

43
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:22,908
I can't see 'em.
I can't see 'em.

44
00:07:28,181 --> 00:07:29,648
Get down!

45
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:33,952
We're surrounded!
They're everywhere!

46
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:35,687
Stay here! Stay here!

47
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:37,923
Paul, no!

48
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:49,000
They want us out
in the open.

49
00:07:50,002 --> 00:07:52,237
Nobody move!
Stay where you are!

50
00:07:52,239 --> 00:07:54,539
They want the pelts.

51
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:56,475
We got to get
on that boat right now

52
00:07:56,477 --> 00:07:57,642
or we'll lose it all.

53
00:08:15,761 --> 00:08:18,763
Get to the boat!
To the boat, son! Move!

54
00:08:19,565 --> 00:08:20,699
Move, move!

55
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:27,572
Leave the furs!
Leave the furs!
To the boat!

56
00:08:52,765 --> 00:08:54,099
Hawk!

57
00:09:00,773 --> 00:09:02,007
Hawk!

58
00:09:02,775 --> 00:09:04,009
Hawk!

59
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:35,740
Grab some pelts!
Come on, grab the pelts!

60
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:58,630
Grab the pelts!
Grab the pelts!

61
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:17,349
Give this
to my little girl.

62
00:10:17,351 --> 00:10:19,150
You're coming with us.
I'll get help.

63
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:28,960
Leave the furs!
Leave the pelts!

64
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:31,062
Willman!

65
00:10:32,398 --> 00:10:33,898
Lean on me.
Just keep going.

66
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:39,704
Get to the boat!

67
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:03,194
Fucking savage!

68
00:11:05,097 --> 00:11:07,065
Get on the fucking boat!

69
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:17,809
Help!

70
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:32,691
Cut the rope!
Cut the rope!

71
00:11:32,693 --> 00:11:34,025
Wait for Amos!

72
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:35,293
No! We go now!

73
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:37,729
Fire the Cannon!

74
00:11:48,774 --> 00:11:50,942
Don't leave! Wait!

75
00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:55,140
And dust becomes flour...

76
00:12:55,142 --> 00:12:57,208
...and when the morning
is clear...

77
00:12:57,210 --> 00:13:01,112
...this child of god will meet
Jesus Christ himself. Amen.

78
00:13:16,228 --> 00:13:17,395
You ready?

79
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:21,032
Hold still.

80
00:13:26,205 --> 00:13:28,339
Where did you learn that?

81
00:13:28,341 --> 00:13:30,942
My father was a doctor.
Bridger!

82
00:13:30,944 --> 00:13:32,510
Captain,
we got a swarm of

83
00:13:32,512 --> 00:13:34,546
tree niggers out here
waiting to finish the job.

84
00:13:38,884 --> 00:13:40,885
Tell me you got
some kind of plan.

85
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:47,091
Glass?

86
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:50,128
Missouri's no good.

87
00:13:51,063 --> 00:13:52,997
Not while the ree's
running it.

88
00:13:53,899 --> 00:13:55,466
We got to
get off this boat.

89
00:13:55,468 --> 00:13:57,235
Oh, you want to
get off the boat?

90
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:01,339
Then what do we do, huh?

91
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:03,374
Take our furs
and sit out there
amongst the ree

92
00:14:03,376 --> 00:14:05,977
like a bunch of ducks?

93
00:14:05,979 --> 00:14:08,980
Only safe thing to do
is track a new course
back up on land.

94
00:14:08,982 --> 00:14:10,515
That'll add weeks
to the trip.

95
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:12,517
Better than floating
where they can
get eyes on us.

96
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:14,485
They got eyes on you
right now, son.

97
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:19,524
What I'm saying is
we stay on the boat.

98
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:21,626
Chart a course
toward the fort

99
00:14:21,628 --> 00:14:23,361
and take our chances
on the water.

100
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:26,197
Glass knows
this territory best.

101
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:27,866
It's his job
to get us home safe.

102
00:14:27,868 --> 00:14:29,367
Get us home safe?
Yeah.

103
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:32,103
Need I remind you
we already lost 32 men?

104
00:14:32,105 --> 00:14:33,972
It's 33 now.
They were my men,
Fitzgerald.

105
00:14:33,974 --> 00:14:35,506
I know how many I lost.

106
00:14:37,076 --> 00:14:39,344
We do like glass says.
That's the end of it.

107
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:54,926
We have to
set the boat loose.

108
00:14:54,928 --> 00:14:57,328
If the ree are tracking us,
they'll find it downriver.

109
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:59,230
Best course is to
hike inland to the grand

110
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:00,632
and follow it to fort kiowa.

111
00:15:00,634 --> 00:15:03,034
On foot?

112
00:15:03,036 --> 00:15:03,034
It'll be winter
before we get there.

113
00:15:03,036 --> 00:15:07,038
Yeah, unless
we come across a post,
trade for some horses.

114
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,440
Ain't no posts
that far over!

115
00:15:09,442 --> 00:15:12,977
Captain, losing this boat
is a goddamn mistake.

116
00:15:12,979 --> 00:15:15,380
The ree ain't
that stupid.

117
00:15:15,382 --> 00:15:17,582
We keep it,
we can lay it up
around arrow's peak.

118
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:19,450
Quit acting like you know
what you're talking about.

119
00:15:19,452 --> 00:15:21,219
Ain't nobody
talking to you.

120
00:15:21,221 --> 00:15:23,488
Who'd listen
to you anyway?

121
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:26,624
Can't find your way
out of your breeches
to take a shit.

122
00:15:26,626 --> 00:15:29,961
All I'm saying is
camp rhulen is
just up the way.

123
00:15:29,963 --> 00:15:31,362
We can hole up there.

124
00:15:31,964 --> 00:15:33,064
We walk.

125
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:36,000
Yeah, I'm sure we will.

126
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:39,237
Wish my dad was a doctor.

127
00:15:39,239 --> 00:15:41,439
Then he could've bought me
a captain's job.

128
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:43,341
What do we do, eh?

129
00:15:43,343 --> 00:15:46,344
Pray these pelts ain't rotten
if we ever get back here?

130
00:15:46,346 --> 00:15:48,112
Make sure
to mark this place.

131
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:50,148
We're leaving a fortune
under these rocks.

132
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:53,484
Glass, chart a course.

133
00:15:54,553 --> 00:15:57,021
Tightest you can that
gets us around the ree.

134
00:15:58,457 --> 00:15:59,691
This ain't right.

135
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:06,497
We all know these furs
ain't gonna be here
by the time we come back.

136
00:16:06,499 --> 00:16:09,367
There's no way we can
haul them all the way
to the fort.

137
00:16:09,369 --> 00:16:12,136
Arikara are all through
the territory.

138
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:13,571
We'll want
our hands free.

139
00:16:13,573 --> 00:16:15,406
We're gonna lose those pelts.

140
00:16:15,408 --> 00:16:16,708
You rather keep the pelts
or your life?

141
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:18,676
Life?

142
00:16:18,678 --> 00:16:21,446
What life you talking about?
I ain't got no life.

143
00:16:21,448 --> 00:16:23,314
I just got living
and the only way I get that

144
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:24,749
is through these pelts.

145
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:27,318
Fuck!

146
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:33,291
Ain't no way I'm going home
after six months

147
00:16:33,293 --> 00:16:35,727
working my ass off
like a mule...

148
00:16:35,729 --> 00:16:38,763
...risking my neck,
men dying, and for what?

149
00:16:38,765 --> 00:16:40,531
Damn near lost everything.

150
00:16:40,533 --> 00:16:42,400
Job's been fucked
from the start!

151
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:46,471
There's the one been
fucking us.

152
00:16:46,473 --> 00:16:50,041
You wonder how the ree
got the dead drop on us...

153
00:16:50,043 --> 00:16:53,244
...when Mr. glass was
supposed to look out
for that very thing?

154
00:16:53,246 --> 00:16:55,446
All them Pawnee
buddies of his.

155
00:16:55,448 --> 00:16:57,715
Pawnee's as much against
the ree as the rest of us.

156
00:16:57,717 --> 00:16:58,750
Yeah?

157
00:16:58,752 --> 00:17:02,620
Well, what about his
little half-breed son?

158
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:06,024
What kind of savage
you think his mama was?

159
00:17:06,026 --> 00:17:07,558
Oh, lay off the boy, Fitz.

160
00:17:08,727 --> 00:17:11,029
All I'm saying is...

161
00:17:11,031 --> 00:17:13,264
...a savage...Is savage.

162
00:17:21,306 --> 00:17:22,707
Hey, glass...

163
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:25,610
...is it true what they say

164
00:17:25,612 --> 00:17:27,211
about you shooting
a lieutenant

165
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:28,813
while living
with them savages?

166
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:36,187
Twenty-one dead soldiers
and 40 dead feathernecks.

167
00:17:36,189 --> 00:17:38,322
But you and your boy the only
ones to walk out alive.

168
00:17:38,324 --> 00:17:40,124
Kind of a miracle.

169
00:17:40,126 --> 00:17:41,225
Shut up, Fitzgerald.

170
00:17:43,662 --> 00:17:45,363
Is that what you did?

171
00:17:45,365 --> 00:17:47,231
Shot one of your own
to save this little dog here?

172
00:17:49,668 --> 00:17:52,503
Why? Was he playing with
this little boy's mama, huh?

173
00:17:52,505 --> 00:17:55,506
Did he kill her?

174
00:17:55,508 --> 00:17:57,642
Hey, you can quit
polishing that rifle
when I'm talking to you.

175
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,244
I'm working on it.

176
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:02,113
You can work on it
when I'm done talking
to you.

177
00:18:02,548 --> 00:18:03,848
Look at me.

178
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:05,283
That's enough!

179
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:08,319
You're forgetting
your place, boy.

180
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:12,190
As far as I can tell,
my place is here

181
00:18:12,192 --> 00:18:14,358
on the smart end
of this rifle.

182
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,427
You move along, Fitzgerald.

183
00:18:17,729 --> 00:18:19,263
That's an order!

184
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:20,631
Listen!

185
00:18:20,633 --> 00:18:22,700
There's only a couple hours
of light left.

186
00:18:22,702 --> 00:18:24,836
We got to stash these pelts
and get rid of the boat.

187
00:18:24,838 --> 00:18:26,304
Let's go!

188
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,547
Beckett!

189
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:12,650
Weston!

190
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:15,153
Why are
they not jumping?

191
00:19:15,155 --> 00:19:16,921
It looks like
they changed their minds.

192
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:24,762
Smart sumbitches.

193
00:19:25,697 --> 00:19:26,864
Smart.

194
00:19:33,472 --> 00:19:35,306
I ought to be on that boat.

195
00:19:39,311 --> 00:19:40,811
They did the right thing.

196
00:21:16,475 --> 00:21:17,775
Was it the right decision?

197
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:18,876
Leaving the boat?

198
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:23,514
The ree own that river.
They would've flanked us.

199
00:21:24,816 --> 00:21:26,984
We stay east of the grand
through the mountains,

200
00:21:26,986 --> 00:21:28,819
we cut a week off our trip.

201
00:21:28,821 --> 00:21:31,322
Lands are bone dry up there.
Nothing for the ree to hunt.

202
00:21:32,524 --> 00:21:33,758
Except us.

203
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,027
Except us.

204
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:44,735
Is it true
what Fitzgerald said?

205
00:21:46,838 --> 00:21:48,806
Is that why you
came out here to the
edge of the world?

206
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:52,910
Glass?

207
00:21:52,912 --> 00:21:54,545
I do like the quiet.

208
00:21:56,748 --> 00:21:57,915
Your boy...

209
00:21:58,784 --> 00:22:01,452
...he's seen a lot.

210
00:22:01,454 --> 00:22:03,621
He got a mother
you need to get him back to?

211
00:29:03,843 --> 00:29:05,109
Mr. glass!

212
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:07,044
There are cubs here!

213
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:12,516
We got cubs here!

214
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:18,255
Christ almighty.

215
00:29:22,527 --> 00:29:23,927
He's down here!

216
00:29:26,364 --> 00:29:28,298
- Keep your eyes open.
- There's bears around.

217
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:30,033
I need your help now!

218
00:29:33,371 --> 00:29:34,538
Oh, my god.

219
00:29:37,909 --> 00:29:40,377
Get me rags now!

220
00:29:40,379 --> 00:29:42,446
Give me rags before
he bleeds out. Rags.

221
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:46,450
Prepare the kit. Bridger!
You hold that.

222
00:29:48,154 --> 00:29:50,120
Easy. Oh, my god.

223
00:29:50,122 --> 00:29:52,389
Got to give him
credit for taking that grizz
down with him.

224
00:29:52,391 --> 00:29:53,991
He shouldn't have shot.

225
00:29:53,993 --> 00:29:55,359
The place is crawling
with tree niggers.

226
00:29:56,427 --> 00:29:58,896
That's enough!
That's enough!

227
00:29:58,898 --> 00:30:00,898
We're still
in ree territory.

228
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,432
He's one of our own men.

229
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:06,570
Scout a circle around us.
North and west.

230
00:30:06,572 --> 00:30:08,138
Take those two with you.

231
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:10,808
Bill, fryman,
you take south and east.

232
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:13,210
Watch for anyone that
might've heard that shot.

233
00:30:13,212 --> 00:30:15,045
We have to stitch him up.

234
00:30:15,047 --> 00:30:17,548
What about me? Captain?

235
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:19,850
You just stay here.

236
00:30:19,852 --> 00:30:21,185
Hold it down.

237
00:30:21,187 --> 00:30:22,586
I'm so sorry, Mr. glass.

238
00:30:22,588 --> 00:30:24,922
Bridger,
press down here.

239
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:27,524
He's bleeding
down here, too.

240
00:30:29,328 --> 00:30:31,595
They're torturing the bastard.

241
00:30:31,597 --> 00:30:33,597
The proper thing to do
would be...

242
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:35,265
...to finish him off quick.

243
00:30:36,367 --> 00:30:38,602
Unless he has a chance
of pulling through.

244
00:30:40,573 --> 00:30:42,606
Pulling through?

245
00:30:42,608 --> 00:30:44,842
You saw what that grizz
did to him.

246
00:30:44,844 --> 00:30:46,143
He'll be dead
inside an hour.

247
00:30:46,145 --> 00:30:47,177
Mmm-hmm.

248
00:30:47,179 --> 00:30:51,348
Yeah, we all will be if he
don't quit wailing like that.

249
00:30:55,086 --> 00:30:57,955
Toward you and
twist it into place.
I'll hold him. Go.

250
00:30:57,957 --> 00:30:59,456
Pa.
Hold him. Go.

251
00:31:00,592 --> 00:31:01,592
Go!

252
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,060
Now!

253
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,100
He passed out.

254
00:31:11,236 --> 00:31:13,437
I'll take advantage
and stitch up his neck.

255
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:15,439
Water.

256
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:26,083
Bridger, tell the others
we'll camp here tonight.

257
00:34:20,792 --> 00:34:23,360
I want everybody up
at the crack of dawn.

258
00:34:24,195 --> 00:34:26,596
Carrying glass
will be hard...

259
00:34:26,598 --> 00:34:28,799
...so we need to get ahead
as far as possible.

260
00:34:30,368 --> 00:34:32,269
We'll divide into two groups.

261
00:34:32,271 --> 00:34:34,538
Fitzgerald, Jones, fryman,

262
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:37,607
you take the east side
of the river.

263
00:34:37,609 --> 00:34:39,643
Anderson, you scout up front.

264
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:42,512
That claw don't
belong to you.

265
00:34:45,283 --> 00:34:46,516
It ain't for me.

266
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:33,730
Stop!

267
00:36:01,259 --> 00:36:04,161
Don't let him down!
Don't let him down!

268
00:36:16,374 --> 00:36:16,373
Watch it.

269
00:36:18,476 --> 00:36:19,776
How we gonna
make it up this?

270
00:36:19,778 --> 00:36:21,244
Slow down.

271
00:36:21,246 --> 00:36:23,346
It's killing us, captain!

272
00:36:30,621 --> 00:36:32,255
Lift it, Bridger!

273
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:35,192
Goddamn it,
keep it steady.

274
00:36:35,194 --> 00:36:36,226
Lift it up higher.

275
00:36:36,228 --> 00:36:37,194
I am.

276
00:36:39,564 --> 00:36:40,964
And heave!

277
00:36:42,501 --> 00:36:44,267
I'll go up and pull.

278
00:36:50,408 --> 00:36:51,808
My foot!

279
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:54,544
Enough of this shit!

280
00:36:54,546 --> 00:36:57,447
We'll never make it across
like this, captain.

281
00:36:57,449 --> 00:36:58,982
He's burning up.

282
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:04,387
Cap'n, you ain't doing us
nor him no favors...

283
00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:06,556
...by letting him go on
suffering like this.

284
00:37:08,459 --> 00:37:10,961
Captain, it's all
the same up here.

285
00:37:10,963 --> 00:37:13,830
We're gonna have to go back.
Find another way.

286
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:23,540
Glass. Hugh.

287
00:37:25,443 --> 00:37:27,477
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

288
00:37:28,479 --> 00:37:30,614
Lay that rag over his eyes,
Mr. Bridger.

289
00:37:30,616 --> 00:37:31,881
What?

290
00:37:31,883 --> 00:37:33,350
Lay the rag over his eyes.

291
00:37:33,352 --> 00:37:34,551
Wait!

292
00:37:34,553 --> 00:37:35,819
I'm sorry, Hugh.

293
00:37:35,821 --> 00:37:37,354
Sir, I can't do that.

294
00:37:37,356 --> 00:37:38,822
How do we
get back without him?

295
00:37:38,824 --> 00:37:40,724
Only he knows the way.

296
00:37:40,726 --> 00:37:41,524
Lay the rag
over his eyes.

297
00:37:41,526 --> 00:37:42,792
I can't.

298
00:37:42,794 --> 00:37:43,960
Wait! How do we get back--

299
00:37:48,532 --> 00:37:50,333
lay it over his eyes!

300
00:37:50,701 --> 00:37:51,968
Step back.

301
00:37:55,373 --> 00:37:57,774
Bridger, stop!
Bridger, Henry.

302
00:37:57,776 --> 00:37:59,709
Henry! Henry, please.

303
00:37:59,711 --> 00:38:02,345
Captain. Captain.
Please. Please leave--

304
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:14,024
there's a $70 bonus

305
00:38:14,026 --> 00:38:16,826
from the rocky mountain fur
company to the two men...

306
00:38:16,828 --> 00:38:18,762
...that stay with glass
to see this through.

307
00:38:18,764 --> 00:38:19,929
I'll stay!

308
00:38:19,931 --> 00:38:21,898
Me, too.
Money or not, I'll stay.

309
00:38:23,534 --> 00:38:24,734
I'll need a third.

310
00:38:25,403 --> 00:38:26,703
Sorry, captain.

311
00:38:26,705 --> 00:38:29,039
I have a family.
I'm not crazy.

312
00:38:30,941 --> 00:38:33,543
Captain, three men
can't hold off
a party of ree,

313
00:38:33,545 --> 00:38:36,079
much less some boys.

314
00:38:36,081 --> 00:38:38,715
Besides, $70 ain't
gonna buy nobody
a new set of ears.

315
00:38:38,717 --> 00:38:41,084
A hundred, then.

316
00:38:41,086 --> 00:38:43,887
This man is the only reason
we're still alive.

317
00:38:43,889 --> 00:38:46,089
We were 45 men
when this started.

318
00:38:46,091 --> 00:38:48,491
Now we're ten.
Almost nine.

319
00:38:48,493 --> 00:38:50,360
He's my father.
He can have my share.

320
00:38:50,362 --> 00:38:52,562
Mine, too.
He can have my share also.

321
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:58,401
All right.

322
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:00,970
If Mr. Bridger
feels the same way,

323
00:39:00,972 --> 00:39:02,072
I'll lag behind with them.

324
00:39:02,074 --> 00:39:03,740
You?
Yep.

325
00:39:03,742 --> 00:39:06,009
You already lost
my share of the pelts...

326
00:39:06,011 --> 00:39:08,578
...so I got no choice
but to make it up
by some other means.

327
00:39:10,381 --> 00:39:13,049
Sticking around
for another day or two
don't make no difference.

328
00:39:13,051 --> 00:39:15,518
$300...At least I get to
go home with something.

329
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,821
Glass is to be cared
for until, understood?

330
00:39:18,823 --> 00:39:21,024
Yeah. You have my word.
I understand.

331
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:24,594
You boys get him
down off this slope

332
00:39:24,596 --> 00:39:26,062
and somewhere safe
before dark.

333
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:27,997
Fitzgerald.

334
00:39:30,768 --> 00:39:33,570
Glass is to be cared for
as long as necessary.

335
00:39:33,572 --> 00:39:35,405
And a proper burial
when it's time.

336
00:39:35,407 --> 00:39:36,373
He's earned it.

337
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:38,742
I understand.

338
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:43,713
You hurt yourself?

339
00:39:44,482 --> 00:39:45,815
I'll be fine.

340
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:33,783
<i> Three hundred bucks</i>

341
00:42:33,785 --> 00:42:35,885
<i> goes a long way</i>
<i> toward retirement.</i>

342
00:42:35,887 --> 00:42:38,254
<i> Go down to Texas, find me</i>
<i> a decent piece of land,</i>

343
00:42:38,256 --> 00:42:39,756
<i> and start pissing</i>
<i> in the wind.</i>

344
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:43,893
Get me the hell out of this
godforsaken place.

345
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:49,966
Ree done that to you?

346
00:42:51,902 --> 00:42:53,169
I'm just asking.

347
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:55,738
Yeah, they done it.

348
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:58,975
They took their sweet time
with it.

349
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:01,778
At the start,
i didn't feel nothing.

350
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:03,947
I just heard the sound...

351
00:43:03,949 --> 00:43:06,316
...of the knife scraping
against my skull and...

352
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:09,018
...them all laughing
and whooping

353
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:11,154
and hollering and whatnot.

354
00:43:11,156 --> 00:43:13,323
Then the blood came.

355
00:43:13,325 --> 00:43:15,892
It was cold. It started
streaming down my face,

356
00:43:15,894 --> 00:43:17,727
in my eyes, and...

357
00:43:17,729 --> 00:43:18,928
...breathing it in.

358
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:21,030
Choking on it.

359
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:24,334
That's when I felt it.

360
00:43:25,369 --> 00:43:26,936
Yeah, felt all of it.

361
00:43:28,172 --> 00:43:30,006
I got my head turned
inside out.

362
00:43:31,241 --> 00:43:32,842
Jesus.

363
00:43:32,844 --> 00:43:35,378
Them Indians
down Texas way...

364
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:37,380
...they may rob you,
but they ain't gonna
take your topknot.

365
00:43:39,049 --> 00:43:40,249
When was it?

366
00:43:44,188 --> 00:43:47,690
Goddamn it, will you quit
that noise now, will you?

367
00:43:48,892 --> 00:43:49,993
Quit it.

368
00:44:15,919 --> 00:44:17,754
<i> I'm falling further back</i>

369
00:44:17,756 --> 00:44:19,722
<i> from Henry and the boys</i>
<i> on account of tending to you.</i>

370
00:44:24,361 --> 00:44:26,029
Got to get up
the damn mountain,

371
00:44:26,031 --> 00:44:27,897
but winter keeps
chasing us down.

372
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:33,269
If you ready
to take the sacrament...

373
00:44:35,372 --> 00:44:37,140
...i can do that for you.

374
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:44,213
What you holding to, glass?

375
00:44:48,052 --> 00:44:49,052
You know...

376
00:44:50,187 --> 00:44:52,221
...it would be better...

377
00:44:52,223 --> 00:44:54,791
...if you were to take that
last breath of yours now...

378
00:44:55,125 --> 00:44:56,392
For all of us.

379
00:44:59,296 --> 00:45:01,464
Now you hung tough.

380
00:45:01,466 --> 00:45:03,032
And that's something.

381
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:05,835
I'm begging you.

382
00:45:05,837 --> 00:45:07,804
Them ree are so close
i can smell 'em.

383
00:45:07,806 --> 00:45:10,073
You can smell 'em, too.

384
00:45:10,075 --> 00:45:12,842
You got to think of your boy.
All right?

385
00:45:12,844 --> 00:45:14,477
'Cause you're gonna kill him.

386
00:45:14,479 --> 00:45:16,345
You'll kill us all.

387
00:45:23,754 --> 00:45:26,189
I can muzzle you if you like.

388
00:45:26,191 --> 00:45:28,224
Take away this suffering
quick and easy.

389
00:45:28,226 --> 00:45:30,426
No one ever has to know
that you give up.

390
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:35,231
All you have to do is blink
if you want me to do that.

391
00:45:41,772 --> 00:45:43,439
Save your boy and blink.

392
00:45:53,517 --> 00:45:55,518
You just have to blink.

393
00:46:00,958 --> 00:46:02,792
Yeah. There it is.

394
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:05,361
You'd best hope
the good lord'll

395
00:46:05,363 --> 00:46:07,196
get his ass here quick, huh?

396
00:46:11,468 --> 00:46:13,803
Maybe he'll forgive
your sins, maybe not.

397
00:46:13,805 --> 00:46:15,505
Thus I do commend thee
to the lord.

398
00:46:17,842 --> 00:46:22,278
Through Jesus Christ the lord
of all reality and mercy...

399
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:25,348
...and the father
and the creator,
i hold thee--

400
00:46:25,350 --> 00:46:27,917
get away! Get away!

401
00:46:27,919 --> 00:46:30,987
You okay? Jim! Jim! Help!

402
00:46:43,033 --> 00:46:44,467
Help!
Calm down.

403
00:46:44,469 --> 00:46:46,002
Jim! Help!

404
00:46:47,137 --> 00:46:49,539
Don't shout!
You're gonna get
us all killed!

405
00:46:49,541 --> 00:46:52,041
Keep away! I'll tell
the captain what you did.

406
00:46:52,043 --> 00:46:53,376
They'll hang you!

407
00:46:53,378 --> 00:46:56,445
They'll hang you!
Jim, help!

408
00:46:56,447 --> 00:46:58,181
We have an understanding.

409
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:03,886
What's fucking wrong
with you people?

410
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:15,598
Shit.

411
00:48:17,194 --> 00:48:18,928
I got one beaver, hawk.

412
00:48:20,898 --> 00:48:22,231
Breathing changed?

413
00:48:24,101 --> 00:48:25,568
I hadn't noticed.

414
00:48:27,437 --> 00:48:29,105
Damn, he's cold as ice.

415
00:48:30,641 --> 00:48:32,975
Here you go, Mr. glass.

416
00:48:32,977 --> 00:48:35,244
This will help you.
Keep you warm.

417
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:38,080
It's all right.

418
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:41,017
Where's hawk?

419
00:48:42,386 --> 00:48:43,986
He ain't with you?

420
00:48:45,289 --> 00:48:46,322
No.

421
00:48:46,324 --> 00:48:48,057
No?

422
00:48:53,030 --> 00:48:55,364
I understand, Mr. glass.

423
00:48:55,366 --> 00:48:58,567
It's all right.
I think I'll get
a fire going.

424
00:48:58,569 --> 00:49:00,636
Yeah.
Sounds like a good idea.

425
00:49:07,177 --> 00:49:08,344
Hawk!

426
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:12,982
<i> Hawk!</i>

427
00:49:34,104 --> 00:49:36,539
Shh. Ree.

428
00:49:36,541 --> 00:49:39,709
There's about 20 of them
down by the creek.

429
00:49:39,711 --> 00:49:43,012
They're headed this way.
Grab your shit and let's go.

430
00:49:45,048 --> 00:49:47,416
Shit. What do we do?

431
00:49:47,418 --> 00:49:49,318
Run, right now.

432
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:50,753
What about hawk?

433
00:49:50,755 --> 00:49:53,089
He ain't our problem
no more.

434
00:49:53,091 --> 00:49:54,357
We can't just leave him.

435
00:49:54,359 --> 00:49:56,292
Either he's gutted
or scalped.

436
00:49:56,294 --> 00:49:58,627
And if he ain't
he can find us, can't he?

437
00:49:58,629 --> 00:50:00,563
What about glass?

438
00:50:00,565 --> 00:50:02,565
He ain't our problem.
Like us, he's on his own.

439
00:50:03,633 --> 00:50:05,735
We made a promise
to the captain.

440
00:50:05,737 --> 00:50:07,436
A proper burial
when the time was needed.

441
00:50:07,438 --> 00:50:09,605
He needs that rifle!

442
00:50:09,607 --> 00:50:12,775
He couldn't do nothing
with it if you tarred it
to his hand.

443
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:15,411
We can't do this.

444
00:50:15,413 --> 00:50:17,179
We got no fucking choice.

445
00:50:17,181 --> 00:50:18,714
No, we can't.
Look at him.

446
00:50:21,618 --> 00:50:23,652
All right, shit,
then, buddy.
Get him up.

447
00:50:23,654 --> 00:50:25,087
You want to take him?

448
00:50:28,158 --> 00:50:29,725
Come on now!

449
00:50:29,727 --> 00:50:32,128
Easy. Slowly, Fitz.
Easy with him.

450
00:50:35,066 --> 00:50:36,532
Just get your shit.

451
00:50:36,534 --> 00:50:37,566
Get your shit!

452
00:50:39,069 --> 00:50:40,269
Shut up.

453
00:50:44,107 --> 00:50:45,374
Shut up!

454
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:47,143
Hold up!

455
00:50:50,181 --> 00:50:52,248
Fitz. What are you doing?

456
00:50:52,250 --> 00:50:54,250
What does it look like?

457
00:50:54,252 --> 00:50:56,352
Proper burial.
Like you wanted.

458
00:50:56,354 --> 00:50:58,187
No, not like this.

459
00:50:58,189 --> 00:50:59,255
Why not?

460
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:02,525
He's alive, Fitz.
He's alive.

461
00:51:05,128 --> 00:51:06,362
So shoot him.

462
00:51:19,509 --> 00:51:21,277
I have to go. I have to go.

463
00:51:22,646 --> 00:51:24,547
I'm sorry, Mr. glass.
I'm sorry.

464
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:27,783
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

465
00:51:42,132 --> 00:51:43,866
Captain! This way!

466
00:51:45,168 --> 00:51:47,169
There's a path down here!

467
00:51:49,439 --> 00:51:51,240
There ain't shit down there!

468
00:51:51,242 --> 00:51:52,541
We got to climb over!

469
00:51:52,543 --> 00:51:54,343
Glass said to stay east!

470
00:51:54,345 --> 00:51:56,245
Glass can go to hell!

471
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:58,781
What's the map say?

472
00:51:58,783 --> 00:52:00,683
Keep climbing.
We climb, captain.

473
00:52:01,351 --> 00:52:02,651
We keep climbing.

474
00:52:02,653 --> 00:52:04,320
Till we reach old Gabe.

475
00:52:08,425 --> 00:52:09,592
We climb.

476
00:52:12,262 --> 00:52:14,797
We got to wait for murph.
Yeah. You wait for him.

477
00:52:16,166 --> 00:52:17,366
Captain?

478
00:52:19,769 --> 00:52:21,403
Sir...

479
00:52:21,405 --> 00:52:24,340
...Murphy says there's
a way down there.

480
00:52:24,342 --> 00:52:25,875
Who we following?

481
00:52:25,877 --> 00:52:27,343
You follow who you want!

482
00:52:27,345 --> 00:52:28,611
I'm going up!

483
00:52:29,813 --> 00:52:31,480
Stubby, keep going up!

484
00:52:31,482 --> 00:52:33,482
Murph! Come here!

485
00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:11,794
Fire's done.

486
00:57:12,929 --> 00:57:14,797
I can't even feel my feet.

487
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:20,769
Didn't we put enough distance
between us and them ree?

488
00:57:20,771 --> 00:57:23,205
A dozen ree can make twice
as good time as we can.

489
00:57:23,207 --> 00:57:24,540
Twenty.
What?

490
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:29,011
You said you saw
twenty ree.

491
00:57:29,013 --> 00:57:30,913
Yeah? What you talking about?

492
00:57:34,484 --> 00:57:35,918
You woke me up.
Mmm-hmm.

493
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:39,855
You said you saw
twenty ree by the creek.

494
00:57:39,857 --> 00:57:42,925
Well, yeah, twenty,
a dozen, it don't matter.

495
00:57:42,927 --> 00:57:45,828
I wasn't gonna hang around
counting fucking feathers.

496
00:57:49,199 --> 00:57:50,532
As a matter of fact...

497
00:57:53,102 --> 00:57:55,070
...what was you doing
down by the creek
all by yourself?

498
00:57:56,239 --> 00:57:58,073
I'd already brought up
plenty of water.

499
00:57:59,843 --> 00:57:59,842
Hey!

500
00:58:02,579 --> 00:58:04,780
Answer me, Fitzgerald.
I asked you a question.

501
00:58:06,249 --> 00:58:08,984
Don't question me
on account of
you feel guilty.

502
00:58:08,986 --> 00:58:11,720
Answer me or I'll
blow your head off.

503
00:58:11,722 --> 00:58:14,957
You got
a short-term memory, boy.

504
00:58:14,959 --> 00:58:17,960
Your ass would be floating
around the Missouri right now
if it wasn't for me.

505
00:58:20,196 --> 00:58:22,598
You want to ask questions?

506
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:24,700
What you want to ask?
If you want to know, ask it.

507
00:58:24,702 --> 00:58:26,535
Hmm?

508
00:58:26,537 --> 00:58:27,936
You want to know
why you left

509
00:58:27,938 --> 00:58:30,138
Mr. glass back there
for dead, huh?

510
00:58:30,140 --> 00:58:33,609
Or why you left your little
boyfriend running around?

511
00:58:33,611 --> 00:58:36,845
You want to know
if he's still alive?

512
00:58:36,847 --> 00:58:39,047
I'll tell you why.
It's 'cause you ain't
a man yet.

513
00:58:39,049 --> 00:58:41,049
It's 'cause you was
scared shitless.

514
00:58:41,051 --> 00:58:42,217
You're scared now.

515
00:58:42,752 --> 00:58:43,986
The ree.

516
00:58:43,988 --> 00:58:45,087
What of them?

517
00:58:46,122 --> 00:58:48,023
Tell me, did you see 'em?

518
00:58:48,025 --> 00:58:49,024
Put your rifle down.

519
00:58:49,026 --> 00:58:50,058
Did you see the ree?

520
00:58:52,228 --> 00:58:53,262
No.

521
00:58:54,998 --> 00:58:56,732
Not a single one.

522
00:58:59,769 --> 00:59:02,070
You fucking lied to me?
You lied to me!

523
00:59:07,111 --> 00:59:09,978
I had to scare some
sense into you, boy.

524
00:59:09,980 --> 00:59:12,614
Glass was dead.
Hawk we don't know about.

525
00:59:12,616 --> 00:59:15,551
No point in either
of us dying either,
you understand?

526
00:59:15,553 --> 00:59:17,586
The way I see it,
i saved your life twice now.

527
00:59:17,588 --> 00:59:19,221
I ought to be god to you.

528
00:59:20,590 --> 00:59:23,058
And god giveth...
And god taketh away.

529
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:32,100
Lucky fucker.

530
00:59:33,870 --> 00:59:35,938
Next time you want to
shoot somebody...

531
00:59:37,106 --> 00:59:38,874
...you might
want to use powder,

532
00:59:38,876 --> 00:59:40,175
prime your rifle.

533
00:59:43,713 --> 00:59:46,815
Come on. Let's git.
Grab your shit.

534
01:14:26,728 --> 01:14:27,995
Who did this?

535
01:14:27,997 --> 01:14:29,063
I don't know.

536
01:14:37,606 --> 01:14:39,674
Could be captain
leavenworth's boys.

537
01:14:40,976 --> 01:14:42,743
Mmm. Yeah.

538
01:14:44,780 --> 01:14:46,948
Put some eyes on the back
of your head.

539
01:14:50,185 --> 01:14:52,987
These injuns ain't never
as dead as you think they are.

540
01:14:53,922 --> 01:14:55,490
Look at 'em, huh?

541
01:14:55,492 --> 01:14:57,258
They're always
stealing our shit.

542
01:15:34,196 --> 01:15:35,997
We got horses over here!

543
01:15:40,235 --> 01:15:41,736
Hey, Bridger.

544
01:15:47,109 --> 01:15:48,643
We got horses!

545
01:15:54,850 --> 01:15:56,751
What you want to do
about these pigs?

546
01:16:03,859 --> 01:16:06,060
The lord's on our side, kid.

547
01:16:14,670 --> 01:16:16,337
You all right there, kid?

548
01:16:16,339 --> 01:16:18,272
Your head in the right place?

549
01:16:18,774 --> 01:16:19,941
I guess.

550
01:16:25,747 --> 01:16:28,249
I can't help thinking about
whether we did the right--

551
01:16:28,251 --> 01:16:30,585
ain't our place to wonder.

552
01:16:30,587 --> 01:16:33,054
The good lord got us
on a road whether
we choose it or not.

553
01:16:37,593 --> 01:16:40,795
My pop, he weren't
a religious man, you know?

554
01:16:40,797 --> 01:16:42,964
If you couldn't grow it,
kill it, or eat it,

555
01:16:42,966 --> 01:16:45,132
he just plain old
didn't believe in it.

556
01:16:46,902 --> 01:16:49,870
And this one time he head on
up the old saba hills.

557
01:16:49,872 --> 01:16:51,205
San saba hills?

558
01:16:51,207 --> 01:16:56,677
He joined a couple Texas
ranger buddies of his to hunt.

559
01:16:56,679 --> 01:16:59,814
Pretty routine. He done it
like a hundred times before.

560
01:16:59,816 --> 01:17:02,717
Should have been a 3-day kill,
but on the second day,

561
01:17:02,719 --> 01:17:04,986
it all went fucked.

562
01:17:04,988 --> 01:17:07,221
Somehow that night
he lost his buddies.

563
01:17:07,223 --> 01:17:09,390
And to top it off...

564
01:17:09,392 --> 01:17:11,626
...them comanches went
and took the horses.

565
01:17:12,628 --> 01:17:15,329
So he was starving
and delirious...

566
01:17:15,331 --> 01:17:19,266
...and he crawls up
into this mott, this...

567
01:17:19,268 --> 01:17:21,802
...group of trees out
in the middle of nowhere

568
01:17:21,804 --> 01:17:24,305
just sticking up
in this ocean of scrub...

569
01:17:24,307 --> 01:17:26,240
...and he found religion.

570
01:17:27,676 --> 01:17:30,011
At that moment, he told me...

571
01:17:30,646 --> 01:17:32,179
...he found god.

572
01:17:34,182 --> 01:17:35,216
Uh-huh.

573
01:17:39,087 --> 01:17:41,722
And it turns out that god...

574
01:17:43,425 --> 01:17:44,992
...he's a squirrel.

575
01:17:46,228 --> 01:17:48,396
Yeah. A big, old meaty one.

576
01:17:51,667 --> 01:17:53,868
"I found god," he used to say.

577
01:17:55,303 --> 01:17:58,239
"And while sitting there
and basking in the glory

578
01:17:58,241 --> 01:18:00,074
"and sublimity of mercy..."

579
01:18:01,810 --> 01:18:04,045
"...i shot and ate
that son of a bitch."

580
01:18:13,221 --> 01:18:14,321
Mmm.

581
01:18:17,059 --> 01:18:19,794
Yeah. You might want to
close your eyes, kid.

582
01:27:17,966 --> 01:27:19,399
Grizzly.

583
01:27:22,770 --> 01:27:23,971
Grizzly.

584
01:29:59,994 --> 01:30:02,629
Yeah!
There she is.

585
01:30:04,132 --> 01:30:05,565
We did it.

586
01:30:06,934 --> 01:30:08,969
You ought to be
proud of yourself, boy.

587
01:30:09,871 --> 01:30:11,071
Yeah.

588
01:30:11,073 --> 01:30:12,539
We followed orders.

589
01:30:12,541 --> 01:30:15,442
We just skipped
the funeral part.

590
01:30:15,444 --> 01:30:18,545
Don't go down there and
start growing no conscience.

591
01:30:18,547 --> 01:30:20,113
'Cause sure as night'll come

592
01:30:20,115 --> 01:30:22,682
they'll have us swinging
from a couple ropes.

593
01:30:22,684 --> 01:30:24,751
We did what we had to do.

594
01:30:53,214 --> 01:30:55,615
<i> We had the extra</i>
<i> day so we managed to dig...</i>

595
01:30:55,617 --> 01:30:57,184
...a little deeper,
lay rocks on top

596
01:30:57,186 --> 01:30:59,186
so scavengers
couldn't get at him.

597
01:30:59,188 --> 01:31:01,888
It was done right and all.
He was buried right.

598
01:31:03,491 --> 01:31:04,958
Sir, can we--

599
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:07,694
the truth is that...

600
01:31:07,696 --> 01:31:10,797
...when hawk disappeared,
i was worried about savages.

601
01:31:10,799 --> 01:31:14,601
And I was ready to get,
to move on out.

602
01:31:14,603 --> 01:31:17,938
Yeah, but, Bridger here
argued to stay.

603
01:31:18,973 --> 01:31:21,174
He argued to stay...

604
01:31:21,176 --> 01:31:24,611
...so he could at least
build a cross or something...

605
01:31:24,613 --> 01:31:26,513
...to put on top
of glass's grave,

606
01:31:26,515 --> 01:31:29,616
and that's what he did.
That's what we did.

607
01:31:29,618 --> 01:31:31,985
I'm glad you pulled
your weight, Mr. Bridger.

608
01:31:31,987 --> 01:31:33,687
He more than pulled
his weight, captain.

609
01:31:33,689 --> 01:31:36,223
This man here,
he was my partner.

610
01:31:42,530 --> 01:31:46,266
Am I to assume that
the agreed arrangement
did not change?

611
01:31:46,268 --> 01:31:48,869
Uh, fortunately for me,
it did not.

612
01:31:48,871 --> 01:31:49,903
Mmm-hmm.

613
01:32:10,825 --> 01:32:13,026
Thank you...

614
01:32:13,028 --> 01:32:16,229
...for your courage,
honor, and service.

615
01:32:18,032 --> 01:32:19,833
Deal or no deal,
Mr. Bridger,

616
01:32:19,835 --> 01:32:22,002
you deserve something
for what you did.

617
01:32:22,004 --> 01:32:23,169
Thank you.

618
01:32:34,116 --> 01:32:37,651
Kid's been beating himself up
awful bad the whole trip.

619
01:32:40,888 --> 01:32:43,089
We all saw
the shape glass was in.

620
01:32:43,091 --> 01:32:45,725
There was no more
to be done. Right?

621
01:32:45,727 --> 01:32:46,593
Yeah.

622
01:32:48,629 --> 01:32:49,596
We all saw him.

623
01:44:21,388 --> 01:44:22,688
Shh...

624
01:44:24,524 --> 01:44:26,292
Don't make a sound.

625
01:46:06,460 --> 01:46:08,094
- May I join you?
- Yes.

626
01:46:08,096 --> 01:46:11,530
Yeah?
Yes.

627
01:46:11,532 --> 01:46:14,600
I was wondering when
we might be getting
paid for that haul.

628
01:46:14,602 --> 01:46:16,969
'Cause them pelts
we collected

629
01:46:16,971 --> 01:46:19,038
are still out there,
you know...

630
01:46:19,040 --> 01:46:21,574
...under a couple foot
of dirt and snow.

631
01:46:21,576 --> 01:46:23,776
But that ain't my fault.

632
01:46:23,778 --> 01:46:26,879
I'm waiting for
captain leavenworth
to arrive with his army.

633
01:46:26,881 --> 01:46:29,081
Then we'll have
enough men...

634
01:46:29,083 --> 01:46:31,984
...to shoot some civilization
into those fucking arikara

635
01:46:31,986 --> 01:46:33,786
and get back our pelts.

636
01:46:33,788 --> 01:46:35,621
All right. All right.

637
01:46:36,690 --> 01:46:38,591
When's that supposed
to happen?

638
01:46:38,959 --> 01:46:40,860
I don't know.

639
01:46:40,862 --> 01:46:42,862
But until then,
nobody gets paid.

640
01:46:45,499 --> 01:46:48,033
Listen here, all right?

641
01:46:48,035 --> 01:46:51,904
I was hired to trap 'em.
I wasn't hired to guard 'em.

642
01:46:51,906 --> 01:46:55,741
The way I see it,
now you, you got a safe.

643
01:46:56,610 --> 01:46:58,477
It's probably
full of money.

644
01:46:58,479 --> 01:47:01,080
You signed a contract
to protect your boss

645
01:47:01,082 --> 01:47:02,815
and your boss's property.

646
01:47:03,984 --> 01:47:05,651
And that safe
isn't full anymore.

647
01:47:05,653 --> 01:47:07,153
It's short about $300.

648
01:47:08,488 --> 01:47:10,956
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

649
01:47:10,958 --> 01:47:13,025
It means,
according to my records...

650
01:47:13,027 --> 01:47:15,161
...you purchased more goods
on the expedition

651
01:47:15,163 --> 01:47:17,630
than what you are
owed by the company.

652
01:47:22,135 --> 01:47:24,637
Now, happy new year,
Fitzgerald.

653
01:56:30,616 --> 01:56:33,318
Fryman!
White man at the gate!

654
01:56:46,132 --> 01:56:47,599
Speak English.

655
01:56:47,601 --> 01:56:50,002
I have no weapon.

656
01:56:50,004 --> 01:56:51,536
Open her up!

657
01:56:51,538 --> 01:56:53,372
Get the captain!

658
01:56:53,374 --> 01:56:54,139
<i> Where are your men?</i>

659
01:56:55,408 --> 01:56:56,575
All dead.

660
01:56:57,143 --> 01:56:58,744
Who was he?

661
01:56:58,746 --> 01:57:01,213
I don't know.
Something to eat, please?

662
01:57:01,215 --> 01:57:02,714
Food comes at a price.

663
01:57:04,017 --> 01:57:05,183
I have no money.

664
01:57:05,185 --> 01:57:07,352
Then you don't eat.

665
01:57:07,354 --> 01:57:09,788
Give back some of them
stolen pelts you buy
from the injuns.

666
01:57:09,790 --> 01:57:11,490
Not now, Jones.
Huh?

667
01:57:11,492 --> 01:57:13,258
Silver. How is this? Silver.

668
01:57:16,496 --> 01:57:17,696
This all you got?

669
01:57:20,033 --> 01:57:22,401
We was nine.

670
01:57:22,403 --> 01:57:24,536
My friend,
he die in the snow.

671
01:57:25,204 --> 01:57:27,539
And the other was...

672
01:57:27,541 --> 01:57:29,608
...kill by wolf.
I see it.

673
01:57:29,610 --> 01:57:31,576
By wolf, yeah, kill.

674
01:57:32,311 --> 01:57:33,779
Where'd you get this?

675
01:57:34,414 --> 01:57:36,314
Canteen.

676
01:57:36,316 --> 01:57:38,383
He drop it.
He kill toussaint,
he drop it--

677
01:57:38,751 --> 01:57:41,153
who? Who?

678
01:57:41,155 --> 01:57:42,621
I don't know.
I don't see.

679
01:57:44,290 --> 01:57:45,257
It could be hawk.

680
01:57:48,227 --> 01:57:49,795
Yeah, could be.

681
01:57:49,797 --> 01:57:51,797
That half-breed runt
couldn't steal no horse.

682
01:57:51,799 --> 01:57:53,565
- Maybe it was Weston.
- Or Beckett.

683
01:57:53,567 --> 01:57:54,766
How far from here?

684
01:57:54,768 --> 01:57:56,468
Thirty mile.

685
01:57:56,470 --> 01:57:58,336
Northwest,
near the yellowstone.

686
01:57:58,338 --> 01:58:00,105
The yellowstone!

687
01:58:00,107 --> 01:58:02,374
Get the horses saddled.
Torches and supplies.

688
01:58:02,376 --> 01:58:04,342
Ten dollars a man.

689
01:58:04,344 --> 01:58:06,244
Anderson, you stay here.

690
01:58:06,246 --> 01:58:08,547
Yes, sir.
Feed him and watch him.

691
01:58:10,216 --> 01:58:11,550
I'll get you a drink.

692
01:58:27,733 --> 01:58:29,201
When we get to
the yellowstone,

693
01:58:29,203 --> 01:58:30,469
we split into two groups!

694
01:58:42,415 --> 01:58:44,249
Hawk!

695
01:58:44,251 --> 01:58:45,817
Hawk, you out there?

696
01:58:53,827 --> 01:58:55,460
Whoa! Whoa!

697
01:59:03,136 --> 01:59:04,569
Keep your guard up!

698
01:59:06,439 --> 01:59:07,739
Eyes in front!

699
01:59:19,619 --> 01:59:21,486
Who are you?

700
01:59:21,488 --> 01:59:22,888
Beckett? Is that you?

701
01:59:34,834 --> 01:59:35,867
Glass?

702
01:59:37,303 --> 01:59:38,236
Glass!

703
01:59:39,205 --> 01:59:40,872
Jesus Christ!

704
01:59:40,874 --> 01:59:42,507
Jesus Christ,
what happened?

705
01:59:43,242 --> 01:59:44,709
Where is he?

706
01:59:47,813 --> 01:59:49,614
Jones, take him. Go.

707
01:59:50,783 --> 01:59:53,351
I'm riding ahead.
Bill, take Bridger.

708
01:59:54,487 --> 01:59:55,754
Take Bridger!

709
02:00:10,236 --> 02:00:11,303
Have you seen Fitzgerald?

710
02:00:11,305 --> 02:00:12,237
No, sir.

711
02:00:18,411 --> 02:00:20,745
Get up. Get up!

712
02:00:20,747 --> 02:00:22,547
You seen Fitzgerald?
No, sir.

713
02:00:22,549 --> 02:00:23,515
Fitzgerald?

714
02:00:33,593 --> 02:00:34,793
Whoa, easy.

715
02:00:34,795 --> 02:00:36,228
Where did he go?

716
02:00:36,862 --> 02:00:38,563
Who?

717
02:00:38,565 --> 02:00:40,298
Fitzgerald.
Where did he go?

718
02:00:40,300 --> 02:00:41,533
I have no idea.

719
02:00:41,535 --> 02:00:43,001
Tell me or
I'll take your head off.

720
02:00:43,003 --> 02:00:44,236
I swear to god--

721
02:00:45,304 --> 02:00:46,805
tell me. Tell me!

722
02:00:46,807 --> 02:00:48,573
Texas!

723
02:00:48,575 --> 02:00:50,675
He said he was
going to Texas.

724
02:00:50,677 --> 02:00:52,877
He said he was
gonna reenlist.

725
02:00:52,879 --> 02:00:54,546
Then he started
talking about property.

726
02:00:54,548 --> 02:00:56,548
"A decent piece of land."

727
02:00:56,550 --> 02:00:58,683
He's heading for Texas.
That's all I know.

728
02:00:58,685 --> 02:00:59,884
Stay here.

729
02:01:03,389 --> 02:01:04,689
Fitzgerald!

730
02:01:06,292 --> 02:01:07,559
Fitzgerald!

731
02:01:36,322 --> 02:01:37,622
Goddamn it!

732
02:01:40,559 --> 02:01:41,960
Goddamn it!

733
02:01:42,962 --> 02:01:45,664
Jones!
Get the captain!

734
02:01:45,666 --> 02:01:46,898
Fryman!

735
02:01:46,900 --> 02:01:48,366
Open the gate!

736
02:01:48,368 --> 02:01:49,634
Open it up!

737
02:01:51,837 --> 02:01:53,338
Murphy,
get the captain.

738
02:01:59,879 --> 02:02:02,314
Get him to the doctor. Now!

739
02:02:03,783 --> 02:02:06,985
You said he was dead!
You said he was dead!

740
02:02:06,987 --> 02:02:08,386
I thought he was, I swear!

741
02:02:10,056 --> 02:02:11,690
He lied to me!

742
02:02:11,692 --> 02:02:13,325
You're a liar.

743
02:02:13,327 --> 02:02:15,560
You left him out there!

744
02:02:16,696 --> 02:02:18,797
Say the lord's prayer.

745
02:02:18,799 --> 02:02:20,765
Say the lord's prayer!

746
02:02:22,068 --> 02:02:24,669
Our father,
who art in heaven.

747
02:02:24,671 --> 02:02:26,638
Who art--
i can't!

748
02:02:26,640 --> 02:02:28,440
Shut up! Shut up!

749
02:02:28,442 --> 02:02:29,874
From here out,

750
02:02:29,876 --> 02:02:31,876
you're a prisoner
charged with treason!

751
02:02:31,878 --> 02:02:34,412
Take him to the cage!
Take him to the cage

752
02:02:34,414 --> 02:02:36,448
or you'll hang
alongside him!

753
02:02:36,450 --> 02:02:38,350
I thought he was gonna die!

754
02:02:39,685 --> 02:02:41,386
Fitz lied to me!

755
02:02:42,621 --> 02:02:43,588
I couldn't help him!

756
02:02:47,593 --> 02:02:49,027
Glass!

757
02:02:49,029 --> 02:02:50,628
Fitz lied to me!

758
02:03:21,060 --> 02:03:22,761
How is he?

759
02:03:22,763 --> 02:03:23,995
He'll be fine,
but there is swelling.

760
02:03:23,997 --> 02:03:25,663
He needs to rest.

761
02:03:25,665 --> 02:03:27,532
I'll be back
to check up on him.

762
02:03:36,909 --> 02:03:38,676
He ran off, didn't he?

763
02:03:47,720 --> 02:03:49,654
Bridger's telling the truth.

764
02:03:51,690 --> 02:03:54,058
How's that?

765
02:03:54,060 --> 02:03:57,462
Fitzgerald lied to him.
He was just following orders.

766
02:03:59,865 --> 02:04:02,500
He wasn't there when
Fitzgerald stabbed
my boy to death.

767
02:04:07,540 --> 02:04:09,040
Is that what happened?

768
02:04:11,110 --> 02:04:12,644
He killed hawk.

769
02:04:16,849 --> 02:04:18,983
I need a horse and gun.

770
02:04:18,985 --> 02:04:21,886
No, you need
to rest and eat.
I'm going after him.

771
02:04:21,888 --> 02:04:23,087
No.

772
02:04:24,857 --> 02:04:26,825
You'll never find him
without me.

773
02:04:26,827 --> 02:04:29,527
If we wait till morning
he'll get away.

774
02:04:29,529 --> 02:04:30,895
No, he won't.

775
02:04:32,064 --> 02:04:33,598
He's afraid.

776
02:04:35,100 --> 02:04:37,836
He knows how far
i came for him.

777
02:04:39,071 --> 02:04:40,705
Same as that elk.

778
02:04:40,707 --> 02:04:44,642
When they get afraid,
they run deep into the woods.

779
02:04:44,644 --> 02:04:47,879
I got him trapped.
He just doesn't know it yet.

780
02:04:48,681 --> 02:04:50,215
How can you be so sure?

781
02:04:51,250 --> 02:04:53,818
'Cause he has
everything to lose.

782
02:04:56,155 --> 02:04:58,523
All I had was that boy.

783
02:04:59,892 --> 02:05:01,960
And he took him away from me.

784
02:05:05,598 --> 02:05:07,732
I can't let you
go back out there.

785
02:05:07,734 --> 02:05:09,100
Not again.

786
02:05:12,771 --> 02:05:15,073
I ain't afraid to die anymore.

787
02:05:17,076 --> 02:05:18,843
I done it already.

788
02:05:24,683 --> 02:05:26,251
I'm going with you.

789
02:06:41,961 --> 02:06:43,761
That's his horse,
all right.

790
02:06:46,799 --> 02:06:49,334
No way he could've ridden him
through the night.

791
02:06:49,336 --> 02:06:50,935
How far ahead?

792
02:06:51,837 --> 02:06:53,638
Half a day at the most.

793
02:06:54,006 --> 02:06:56,207
Could be ree.

794
02:06:56,209 --> 02:06:59,611
If they aren't his,
we lose him.

795
02:06:59,613 --> 02:07:03,081
Unless he reenlisted
so he could justify
killing again...

796
02:07:03,083 --> 02:07:05,617
...these tracks
right here are his.

797
02:07:15,694 --> 02:07:17,729
<i> I can't remember</i>
<i> my wife's face.</i>

798
02:07:18,864 --> 02:07:20,932
<i> Last week,</i>
<i> she was still with me.</i>

799
02:07:22,701 --> 02:07:24,202
<i> Now she's gone.</i>

800
02:07:27,906 --> 02:07:30,675
I worry I won't recognize her
when I get back home.

801
02:07:43,155 --> 02:07:45,123
Is it true
you killed an officer?

802
02:07:50,295 --> 02:07:53,131
I just killed the man
who was trying to kill my son.

803
02:08:12,017 --> 02:08:13,217
Smoke.

804
02:08:14,453 --> 02:08:15,887
How close?

805
02:08:20,993 --> 02:08:23,461
No more than
a mile up that way.

806
02:08:23,463 --> 02:08:27,098
I'm gonna head up to the west.
You go down to the east.

807
02:08:27,100 --> 02:08:29,167
Let's see if we can
find some tracks.

808
02:08:30,135 --> 02:08:31,769
And if it's the ree?

809
02:08:32,905 --> 02:08:35,106
If it's the ree,
you turn right back around

810
02:08:35,108 --> 02:08:36,774
and meet me back here.

811
02:10:05,063 --> 02:10:07,965
Now, I wouldn't expect
to find a man
of your stature...

812
02:10:07,967 --> 02:10:09,534
...so far away from his stove

813
02:10:09,536 --> 02:10:11,068
on a morning
as cold as this, captain.

814
02:10:11,070 --> 02:10:12,870
You lost?

815
02:10:12,872 --> 02:10:15,473
I'm here to take you back
to fort kiowa...

816
02:10:15,475 --> 02:10:17,275
...where you will be
tried for murder.

817
02:10:17,910 --> 02:10:19,811
Is that so?

818
02:10:19,813 --> 02:10:22,446
I ain't crazy
about your plan.

819
02:10:22,448 --> 02:10:24,115
Besides,
i got one of my own.

820
02:17:52,664 --> 02:17:54,865
We had a deal, glass!

821
02:17:58,937 --> 02:18:01,438
I tried to tell your boy,
all right?

822
02:18:01,440 --> 02:18:04,308
I tried to tell him,
but he wouldn't listen

823
02:18:04,310 --> 02:18:06,377
and he kept on screaming.

824
02:18:06,379 --> 02:18:08,345
He was gonna get
everybody killed.

825
02:18:10,382 --> 02:18:12,750
But you and me...
We had a deal.

826
02:18:15,320 --> 02:18:17,955
You know what
happened out there.

827
02:18:17,957 --> 02:18:20,924
And on my soul,
the lord...He knows...

828
02:18:20,926 --> 02:18:22,593
...what happened out there.

829
02:18:25,497 --> 02:18:26,964
There was no deal.

830
02:18:30,568 --> 02:18:32,036
You killed my boy.

831
02:18:35,974 --> 02:18:38,375
Well, maybe you should've
raised a man,

832
02:18:38,377 --> 02:18:39,510
instead of some
girlie little bitch.

833
02:18:51,556 --> 02:18:52,890
Goddamn it.

834
02:21:16,835 --> 02:21:19,937
You came all this way
just for your revenge, huh?

835
02:21:22,974 --> 02:21:24,908
Well, you enjoy it, glass.

836
02:21:26,711 --> 02:21:29,213
'Cause there ain't nothing
gonna bring your boy back.

837
02:21:31,850 --> 02:21:33,484
No, it won't.

838
