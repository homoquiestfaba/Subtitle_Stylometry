00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:03,470
(dramatic music)

00:00:09,909 --> 00:00:12,576
(ominous music)

00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:26,510
(dog barking)

00:00:30,279 --> 00:00:32,446
(moaning)

00:01:13,041 --> 00:01:14,606
- Thank you.

00:01:14,606 --> 00:01:15,773
Well, goodbye.

00:01:17,027 --> 00:01:19,444
(gun firing)

00:01:35,557 --> 00:01:36,390
- How was it?

00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:37,933
- He wasn't my type.

00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:42,313
- There were supposed to be two.

00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:47,080
- Chino Sandoval himself will
be delivering the other one

00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,680
in about 10 minutes.

00:01:53,657 --> 00:01:56,324
(ominous music)

00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,120
- [Chino] Hey, Tony!

00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:12,900
- [Weatherman] Spring
showers this morning,

00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,419
followed by partial
clearing this afternoon.

00:02:15,419 --> 00:02:17,919
(guns firing)

00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:30,050
It's currently 51.

00:02:37,371 --> 00:02:39,704
(gun fires)

00:03:15,521 --> 00:03:17,060
- [Brigit] The Karpov
family left a long trail

00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:19,630
of death across two continents,

00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:22,890
finally settling here
in the City of Angels,

00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:25,040
where they've continued
their killing ways.

00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:27,843
Their time will soon be over.

00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:33,253
If my mother and father could see me now,

00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:35,970
I know they wouldn't be too pleased

00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:37,820
with the road I've taken to get here.

00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:43,070
I'm no longer the innocent little girl

00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:45,187
I was all those years ago.

00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:05,080
My parents and I often talked

00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,530
about visiting America one day,

00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:10,230
and I had always looked
forward to a holiday together.

00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:14,863
I never imagined I'd end up coming alone.

00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:18,963
And with a job to do.

00:04:20,547 --> 00:04:23,297
(dramatic music)

00:05:17,349 --> 00:05:19,099
- It's a bit spartan.

00:05:29,987 --> 00:05:30,843
- All right.

00:05:31,917 --> 00:05:32,750
- There's a black car out back.

00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:33,583
Here.

00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,183
To a long life and quick death.

00:05:51,296 --> 00:05:53,963
(glasses clink)

00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,410
- Not bad.

00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:03,350
- I thought you'd like it.

00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:04,493
Okay, to business.

00:06:05,569 --> 00:06:06,402
For you.

00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:09,613
The best time would be
late Saturday night.

00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:11,653
- Tomorrow?

00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:13,423
- Yes.

00:06:13,423 --> 00:06:14,470
At the club.

00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:15,600
They will all be there.

00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,160
Couriers make deliveries up until closing.

00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,610
Cash takes for the week

00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:21,960
from all Karpov business
interests in the city.

00:06:23,187 --> 00:06:24,567
- Any of them legal?

00:06:24,567 --> 00:06:25,400
- A few.

00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,233
The club is straight.

00:06:26,233 --> 00:06:27,313
A business clientele.

00:06:30,597 --> 00:06:32,770
Now, this is Luc.

00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:34,310
Your backup.

00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:35,310
- I'm going in alone.

00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:36,350
It was agreed.

00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:38,003
- No, not alone.

00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:41,100
- I trust no one but you.

00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,360
- Then please trust me.

00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,740
He will be at the club tonight

00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:46,540
to answer any questions about
the Karpovs or the club.

00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:48,180
He did all of the surveillance.

00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:51,523
My face is too famous in this town.

00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:56,833
Move fast.

00:06:57,770 --> 00:06:59,110
Don't hesitate.

00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:01,437
These bastards sniff
out fear for a living.

00:07:04,338 --> 00:07:05,171
Well.

00:07:08,138 --> 00:07:09,221
Good evening.

00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:14,737
(ominous music)

00:07:49,963 --> 00:07:52,546
(upbeat music)

00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:00,267
♪ Seems like something good has arrived ♪

00:08:00,267 --> 00:08:03,443
♪ It's insatiable time ♪

00:08:03,443 --> 00:08:08,443
♪ Hope isn't over before I know ♪

00:08:09,657 --> 00:08:14,074
♪ Maybe it's the lie, maybe a theory ♪

00:08:21,743 --> 00:08:23,500
- Is this seat taken?

00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,500
- What'll you have?

00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,950
- Vodka chilled, straight up.

00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:40,040
- You look dressed to kill.

00:08:41,144 --> 00:08:42,880
- Are you old enough to be in here?

00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,980
- You wanna see my fake ID?

00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:47,550
- I'm not convinced
you'll be a part of this.

00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:48,890
- You will be.

00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:49,910
- You're confident.

00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:51,293
- [Luc] I'm aware of my skills.

00:08:51,293 --> 00:08:52,126
- I'm not.

00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,050
- Like it or not, I think the
decision's already been made.

00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:59,510
- Like it or not, I'm in charge.

00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:03,670
And if I don't share your
confidence in you and your skills,

00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:06,763
I assure you, we will have
a very brief relationship.

00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,333
- Fair enough.

00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:15,110
Far wall, left of the stairs.

00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:16,410
It goes to the office.

00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:17,740
That's George.

00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:18,720
Big brother.

00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,483
He runs the club and
most of the operations.

00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:25,960
His Pa, Sergei.

00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:26,980
Patriarch.

00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:28,363
He runs the business.

00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:34,220
He has a gift of investing
illegitimate gains legitimately.

00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:36,793
And vice versa.

00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:39,033
- [Jimmy] Hey, Peter.

00:09:43,913 --> 00:09:44,913
Here you go.

00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:54,953
- Good evening.

00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,550
- Yes, it is.

00:09:57,550 --> 00:09:58,683
- I am Peter.

00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:01,033
May I buy you a drink?

00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:02,770
- No, thank you.

00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:05,343
I tend to get drunk when
others buy my drinks.

00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:11,880
- He is too pretty, this boy.

00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,603
- His company suits me.

00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:17,633
Tonight, anyway.

00:10:18,863 --> 00:10:20,260
- And tomorrow night?

00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:23,391
- Anything special
happening tomorrow night?

00:10:23,391 --> 00:10:25,510
- I will be here.

00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:29,550
- If I feel like going out and
if I feel like coming here,

00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:33,933
if I feel like company,
perhaps I'll look for you.

00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,020
- Don't take her money.

00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:42,070
Her drinks are on me.

00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:44,203
The boy's too.

00:10:47,363 --> 00:10:48,196
Nostrova.

00:10:58,967 --> 00:11:00,610
- And Natalya?

00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:02,800
- I've been here over an
hour, I haven't seen her.

00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,250
She's probably in the office.

00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:09,020
I've been here every Saturday
night for the last month.

00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:11,840
Sergei, George, Peter,
and Natalya all cozy up

00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,583
in the office just before closing.

00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,240
Waiting for the couriers' last drop.

00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,493
It's perfect.

00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:25,520
There may be a bodyguard or
a bouncer or two as well,

00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,823
but, no more.

00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:32,293
So, what's the plan?

00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,960
- Tonight we enjoy.

00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,160
And the drinks are free.

00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:41,713
- Well.

00:11:43,521 --> 00:11:44,354
(glasses clink)

00:11:44,354 --> 00:11:45,517
Here's to them paying.

00:11:47,191 --> 00:11:48,920
- Nostrovia.

00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:49,753
- [Luc] Cheers.

00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:20,533
- Hi.

00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:31,080
- [Brigit] Look at them
all there, drunk arrogance.

00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:37,000
Oh, I am so looking forward

00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,953
to our time together tomorrow night.

00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:44,440
- What's your name?

00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:47,733
- Bogie.

00:12:49,591 --> 00:12:50,640
- (laughs) Gangster, huh?

00:12:52,103 --> 00:12:54,063
Well, you fit right in here.

00:12:54,063 --> 00:12:55,160
- And why do you say that?

00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,363
- Open your eyes, sport.

00:12:57,911 --> 00:12:59,994
(laughs)

00:13:00,982 --> 00:13:03,732
(glass crashing)

00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:13,520
- It's past your bedtime.

00:13:22,241 --> 00:13:24,658
(rock music)

00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:47,803
Tonight is a night of
firsts and perhaps lasts.

00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,810
Never rode a motorcycle before.

00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:53,463
Never taken a man home
on first meeting before.

00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:57,580
Luc didn't say anything,
but I know what he wants.

00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:58,863
I think we both want it.

00:14:00,031 --> 00:14:00,864
We both need it.

00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:57,070
- Not anymore.

00:16:03,752 --> 00:16:06,552
(dramatic music)

00:16:06,552 --> 00:16:08,552
(gasps)

00:16:34,011 --> 00:16:35,750
(kisses)

00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,380
Tomorrow.

00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:38,213
- What?

00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:41,460
- Tomorrow we do it, yes?

00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:42,980
- Yeah.

00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:44,860
But I thought tonight we were gonna just-

00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:47,523
- You were so passionate, so sweet.

00:16:48,462 --> 00:16:49,712
It was lovely, thank you.

00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,150
But now good night.

00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,560
- Oh, you're booting me out?

00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,830
- We fucked, all right?

00:16:57,830 --> 00:16:58,823
Get past it.

00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:01,793
Tomorrow.

00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:05,073
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, tomorrow.

00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:17,140
So, so does this mean
you're confident in me now?

00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:20,280
- Well, I don't know
how much help you'll be,

00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,630
but I'm fairly certain
you won't get me killed.

00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,553
Renault assured me of your skills.

00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:30,040
I won't be holding your hand.

00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,453
- I'm not asking you to.

00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,060
- Yes, all right.

00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:38,083
If you're ready to kill?

00:17:39,635 --> 00:17:41,242
- I am.

00:17:41,242 --> 00:17:43,409
- And you're ready to die?

00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:49,443
- I am.

00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:54,123
- Then I'm confident in you.

00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,203
- I may even surprise you.

00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:07,203
- Then get some rest.

00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,420
You can find your way out.

00:18:27,642 --> 00:18:29,642
(sighs)

00:18:40,544 --> 00:18:43,294
(water bubbling)

00:18:45,684 --> 00:18:48,434
(dramatic music)

00:18:59,073 --> 00:19:01,156
(groans)

- Rocks.

00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:30,140
I'm sure Peter would want
me to put that on his tab.

- There you go.

00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:05,880
- Evening.

00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,470
- Hello.

00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:08,620
Don't.

00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:09,633
We have work to do.

00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:13,550
Now I'm sure she'll be
watching you all night.

00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:16,840
Have a few drinks with her,
and then get rid of her.

00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,240
- What?

00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,243
- Put her in a cab.

00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:24,250
You're not interested in me tonight.

00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:25,413
Go make her feel good.

00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:33,630

00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:35,393

- No.

00:23:08,683 --> 00:23:09,543
How 'bout coffee?

00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:12,023
- Comin' up.

00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:21,283

00:23:29,027 --> 00:23:30,450
Listen, I get off at closing.

00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:31,860
I know this great after hours club.

00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:34,113
- Your boss probably wouldn't like that.

00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,887
- [Jimmy] He's gonna be busy
all night in the office.

00:23:36,887 --> 00:23:38,870
- You're a brave man.

00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:40,470
How 'bout a rain check sometime?

00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:43,303
- Jimmy.

00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,533
Sure, you got it.

00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,153
- You're back.

00:23:58,870 --> 00:23:59,703
- Thirsty?

00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:02,110
- Alone this evening?

00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,193
- For now.

00:24:05,691 --> 00:24:09,833
- Perhaps a nightcap later at closing.

00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:13,220
- Can't say I'll still be here.

00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:14,572
- You will.

00:24:14,572 --> 00:24:15,405
- Will I?

00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,370
- [Peter] I fascinate you.

00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:19,730
- Hardly.

00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:21,660
- [Peter] I intrigue you.

00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:22,493
- Barely.

00:24:24,541 --> 00:24:25,541
- All right.

00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:30,350
You fascinate me.

00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:32,633
You intrigue me.

00:24:34,103 --> 00:24:36,413
Aren't you even slightly curious?

00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:38,883
- Slightly.

00:24:40,347 --> 00:24:41,697
- [Peter] And the nightcap?

00:24:43,068 --> 00:24:44,431
- And then?

00:24:44,431 --> 00:24:47,181
(Peter chuckles)

00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:49,143
- [Man] Hey, Peter.

00:24:49,143 --> 00:24:49,976
Sergei's asking for you.

00:25:00,201 --> 00:25:02,200
- [Jimmy] Let me top that off for you.

00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,303
- Does he always pour it on so heavy?

00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:06,530
- You've inspired him.

00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,090
I'd be careful if I were you.

00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,920
- I can take care of myself.

00:25:20,121 --> 00:25:21,221
- Yeah, I bet you can.

00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:35,940
- Thank you for coming to the Blue Parrot.

00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:37,720
This is our last number.

00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:40,400
We'll be back again next Thursday.

00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,233
- Last call.

00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:49,883
Last call for alcohol.

00:25:59,272 --> 00:26:01,355
(laughs)

00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,630
- Where do you live?

00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:05,040
- At home.

00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:05,873
- No, address.

00:26:05,873 --> 00:26:06,706
Watch your head.

00:26:06,706 --> 00:26:07,603
- 137 North.

00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:10,016
- 137 North Street.

00:26:10,016 --> 00:26:10,849
- Hey!

00:26:10,849 --> 00:26:11,702
- I'll meet you there.

00:26:11,702 --> 00:26:13,650
Let me go talk to my friend, all right?

00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:16,053
I promise I'll be right behind you.

00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,420
- I hope so.

00:26:21,693 --> 00:26:22,860
- Here you go.

00:26:31,414 --> 00:26:32,247
- Uh, Jimmy?

00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:39,673
Good night.

00:26:41,191 --> 00:26:42,870
- Aren't you gonna wait for him?

00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:43,703
- No.

00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:46,160
Tell him...

00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:49,830
Tell him that I left with somebody else.

00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:50,663
- He'll go nuts.

00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:53,200
- I hope so.

00:26:57,910 --> 00:26:58,743
- [Man] Hey, Jimmy.

00:26:58,743 --> 00:26:59,657
You ready to cash out?

00:27:00,703 --> 00:27:01,536
- Yeah.

00:27:04,453 --> 00:27:07,036
(upbeat music)

00:27:16,323 --> 00:27:17,903
Hey.

00:27:17,903 --> 00:27:18,986
Thanks a lot.

00:27:20,214 --> 00:27:22,214
(sighs)

00:27:32,044 --> 00:27:34,711
(ominous music)

00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:05,813
- [Man] See ya.

00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:28,297
(man grunts)

00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:52,812
(knocking)

00:28:54,263 --> 00:28:55,143
- Doorman?

00:28:55,143 --> 00:28:56,060
- Sleeping.

00:29:23,372 --> 00:29:27,180
(guns firing)
(groaning)

00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:29,310
- All right, all right, calm down!

00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:30,503
Take the money!

00:29:34,902 --> 00:29:35,735
You?

00:29:37,973 --> 00:29:38,806
- You know her?

00:29:38,806 --> 00:29:39,790
- Shut it.

00:29:39,790 --> 00:29:40,730
- The others.

00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:42,553
Brother and father, where are they?

00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,313
- Speak.

00:29:48,144 --> 00:29:51,311
(car engine rumbling)

00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:57,253
- Shit.

00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:02,630
Where are they going?

00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:03,680
Are they coming back?

00:30:05,634 --> 00:30:07,640
- You have plenty of time to leave.

00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,603
Just take the money and go.

00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:13,160
Buy yourself something nice.

00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,830
- To be buried in.

00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:15,820
- Stop it.

00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:16,793
You're scaring me.

00:30:18,295 --> 00:30:20,410
- Do you know who we are?

00:30:20,410 --> 00:30:23,520
- Do you think I'd be here if I didn't?

00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,690
- Do we stay or do we go?

00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:27,480
- No, we stay until I
hear what I want to hear.

00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,523
- Fuck you.

00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:32,130
- Not the magic word I was looking for.

00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:36,183
Now, Sergei and George Karpov,

00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,483
they will be returning when?

00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:47,513
Why is it so difficult for a
woman to be taken seriously?

00:30:54,016 --> 00:30:56,143
(gasps)

00:30:56,143 --> 00:30:58,226
(smacks)

00:31:13,143 --> 00:31:14,819
- You're dead.

00:31:14,819 --> 00:31:16,236
You're very dead.

00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,170
My family will-

00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:20,850
- Will be joining you when?

00:31:20,850 --> 00:31:23,600
(dramatic music)

00:31:25,034 --> 00:31:25,913
- Shoot!

00:31:25,913 --> 00:31:28,330
(gun firing)

00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:31,973
- Sorry.

00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:35,200
Would you rather it were you?

00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:38,610
- No.

00:31:38,610 --> 00:31:40,260
- Then let's not get sentimental.

00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:43,823
We will not be fucked
with, do you see that now?

00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,413
- I know who you are.

00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:48,093
- Do you?

00:31:49,424 --> 00:31:50,257
- Yes.

00:31:50,257 --> 00:31:51,683
The Reillys sent you.

00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:55,280
They didn't like our
termination of the Sandovals,

00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,643
so they sent you.

00:31:57,812 --> 00:31:58,645
- The Reillys.

00:31:58,645 --> 00:31:59,543
The Reillys sent us.

00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:01,513
Well, perhaps.

00:32:01,513 --> 00:32:03,573
It's an ugly business,
and you're pretty ugly.

00:32:03,573 --> 00:32:04,520
(Peter shouts)

00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:07,460
Surely you have other enemies.

00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:10,690
- Yes, but none with
the muscle or the balls

00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:13,030
to do something stupid like this.

00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:14,473
- Are you certain of that?

00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:18,950
You all don't seem so intimidating to me.

00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:19,783
- Read my-

00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:23,520
- They were all supposed to be here.

00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:24,980
- They'll be back.

00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:27,083
Sergei likes to handle the money himself.

00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:30,450
They'll be back.

00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:32,563
It's always the same routine.

00:32:40,084 --> 00:32:43,863
(crickets chirping)

00:32:43,863 --> 00:32:44,696
- Ah, good.

00:32:44,696 --> 00:32:45,763
More fruit of the vine.

00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:48,304
Robe.

00:32:48,304 --> 00:32:49,137
- [Juli] There you go.

00:32:50,202 --> 00:32:51,202
- Thank you.

00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:07,222
(phone dialing)

00:33:07,222 --> 00:33:09,889
(phone ringing)

00:33:15,523 --> 00:33:17,570
- Shouldn't we have him answer it?

00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:18,677
- No.

00:33:18,677 --> 00:33:21,003
No answer will force
them back all the sooner.

00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:30,000
Go watch the front doors.

00:33:37,803 --> 00:33:40,072
(sighs)

00:33:40,072 --> 00:33:40,960
(phone beeps)

00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:44,093
- You and all you Reilly bastards
are going to pay for this.

00:33:48,003 --> 00:33:50,320
- And what would you say
would be a fair price?

00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:54,177
- We will kill your whole fucking family.

00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:58,903
Exterminate the entire Reilly bloodline.

00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,193
- Hmm.

00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:03,713
An eye for an eye.

00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:06,270
Very Old Testament.

00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,523
I suppose that would be a fair trade.

00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:15,880
However, wouldn't you like to tell me

00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:18,310
if your father and brother
will be returning together

00:34:18,310 --> 00:34:19,193
or separately?

00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:20,997
- Fuck you.

00:34:22,142 --> 00:34:23,642
- That's unlikely.

00:34:25,713 --> 00:34:28,380
(phone ringing)

00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:32,513
I bet it's for you.

00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:36,670
I'm sorry you won't get
a chance to say goodbye.

00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:38,710
You're off to eternity.

00:34:40,794 --> 00:34:41,794
- My family.

00:34:44,373 --> 00:34:46,290
- I know what you mean.

00:34:48,251 --> 00:34:49,084
Oh, well.

00:34:51,382 --> 00:34:52,799
Adieu, mon amour.

00:34:57,263 --> 00:35:00,162
(gun fires)

00:35:00,162 --> 00:35:02,829
(phone dialing)

00:35:05,423 --> 00:35:08,090
(phone ringing)

00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:16,363
- Yes?

00:35:16,363 --> 00:35:19,690
- George, there's no answer at the club!

00:35:19,690 --> 00:35:21,800
- They better still be there.

00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:22,840
- Where are you?

00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,283
- I just made the pick-up.

00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,530
I'm on my way back.

00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:27,370
- I'll meet you.

00:35:27,370 --> 00:35:28,280
Bring the boys.

00:35:31,593 --> 00:35:32,530
I have to go to the club.

00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:36,330
Drink all you like, but keep
yourselves ready for Papa.

00:35:36,330 --> 00:35:37,980
- Do you need us?

00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:38,930
- No, I'll be back.

00:35:53,803 --> 00:35:56,386
(upbeat music)

00:36:01,370 --> 00:36:02,610
- No!

00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:04,233
The music, turn it back on.

00:36:07,282 --> 00:36:09,964
♪ They say they know she's
walking all over you ♪

00:36:09,964 --> 00:36:14,014
♪ That's what the nice girls do ♪

00:36:14,014 --> 00:36:17,513
♪ That's what the nice girls do ♪

00:36:17,513 --> 00:36:21,434
♪ That's what the nice girls do ♪

00:36:21,434 --> 00:36:25,434
♪ That's what the nice girls do ♪

00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:06,771
♪ That's what the nice girls do ♪

00:37:06,771 --> 00:37:08,147
♪ That's what the nice girls do ♪

00:37:08,147 --> 00:37:10,047
- My fucking brother's having a party.

00:37:13,677 --> 00:37:16,260
(upbeat music)

00:37:25,078 --> 00:37:27,578
(guns firing)

00:37:29,858 --> 00:37:31,941
(groans)

00:37:39,892 --> 00:37:42,642
(glass crashing)

00:38:09,097 --> 00:38:10,097
- All clear!

00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:12,323
I got him.

00:38:25,490 --> 00:38:26,343
You all right?

00:38:28,490 --> 00:38:29,610
Get everyone?

00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:32,400
- Peter and Natalya caught
the bullet train to hell.

00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,950
- [Renault] And Sergei?

00:38:33,950 --> 00:38:34,783
- Not yet.

00:38:34,783 --> 00:38:36,900
We're expecting him any minute.

00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:38,200
- Another time.

00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,033
We must go.

00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:44,120
- Who are you?

00:38:47,938 --> 00:38:49,521
- Adieu, mon amour.

00:38:51,218 --> 00:38:53,218
(gasps)

00:39:01,807 --> 00:39:04,224
(slow music)

00:39:20,085 --> 00:39:22,752
(water running)

00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:39,167
Oh no.

00:39:43,657 --> 00:39:45,740
(groans)

00:40:34,354 --> 00:40:36,175
(crickets chirping)

00:40:36,175 --> 00:40:37,745
- [Michael] Is he going to live then?

00:40:37,745 --> 00:40:38,578
- Yes.

00:40:38,578 --> 00:40:39,411
It went clean through.

00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:44,100
He just needs rest, antibiotics,

00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:46,453
and a change of dressing twice a day.

00:40:47,490 --> 00:40:51,200
Antibiotics three times a day for 10 days.

00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,600
Painkillers as needed.

00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,293
And no alcohol with these.

00:40:57,310 --> 00:40:58,213
- Good night, Doc.

00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:02,690
- Boy, I sure am sorry to be
trouble to you, Mr. Reilly.

00:41:02,690 --> 00:41:04,510
- No trouble.

00:41:04,510 --> 00:41:06,920
You did right to come here, Jimmy.

00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:08,810
- Well, I got out of
there soon as I could.

00:41:08,810 --> 00:41:11,020
I told Sergei I could take care of myself.

00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:13,000
- Good, that's good.

00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,690
Now, tell me about the shooters.

00:41:15,690 --> 00:41:20,270
- Well, one was male, one was female.

00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:22,400
- Did you recognize them?

00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,760
- Guy's been in quite a bit lately, yeah.

00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:25,910
- And the woman?

00:41:25,910 --> 00:41:29,433
- Uh, just the last two nights.

00:41:31,050 --> 00:41:32,850
Didn't seem like they knew
each other from before,

00:41:32,850 --> 00:41:34,603
but obviously.

00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:42,000
Somethin' about that girl, though.

00:41:42,986 --> 00:41:44,403
- [Michael] What?

00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:47,620
- She sure didn't seem like a killer.

00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:50,793
- They never do.

00:42:00,278 --> 00:42:01,340
(chuckles)

00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:02,933
- So, is it true?

00:42:04,517 --> 00:42:05,600
- It is.

00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:07,210
- Bastards deserved it.

00:42:07,210 --> 00:42:09,710
Nothin' but trouble since
they weaseled into town.

00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:12,350
They get them all?

00:42:12,350 --> 00:42:16,413
- George, Peter, and Natalya.

00:42:17,517 --> 00:42:19,800
- Ah, a family tragedy.

00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:21,716
Boy, I'd love to have seen that.

00:42:21,716 --> 00:42:23,700
- Sergei's still alive.

00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:26,393
You can wager he thinks we done it.

00:42:27,250 --> 00:42:29,030
- Payback for hittin' the Sandovals?

00:42:29,030 --> 00:42:30,160
- Nah.

00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:33,010
They were insignificant sods.

00:42:33,010 --> 00:42:35,710
Sergei did the city a public service

00:42:35,710 --> 00:42:37,970
when he run them greasers out.

00:42:37,970 --> 00:42:39,680
This wasn't some little treat

00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:41,960
you were gonna surprise me with, was it?

00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:43,530
- Me, Dad?

00:42:43,530 --> 00:42:45,324
Love to take credit for it.

00:42:45,324 --> 00:42:46,660
But I gotta say no.

00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:51,570
- [Michael] Well, who
would do us such a favor?

00:42:51,570 --> 00:42:52,403
- Don't know.

00:42:56,030 --> 00:42:57,513
- There was someone else there.

00:42:58,637 --> 00:42:59,470
- Who?

00:43:01,815 --> 00:43:03,256
- Renault.

00:43:03,256 --> 00:43:04,156
Renault showed up.

00:43:05,325 --> 00:43:06,920
He wasn't one of the
hitters, but he was there.

00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:07,753
- Renault?

00:43:07,753 --> 00:43:09,380
Renault who?

00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:10,940
- Freelance fixer.

00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:12,110
Never a shooter.

00:43:12,110 --> 00:43:14,143
- Could he set up something like this?

00:43:15,410 --> 00:43:17,043
- Maybe, no.

00:43:18,114 --> 00:43:20,660
I mean, no one would go to him
for something this important.

00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:21,690
He's good.

00:43:21,690 --> 00:43:23,333
He's thorough.

00:43:23,333 --> 00:43:25,350
But he's strictly small time.

00:43:25,350 --> 00:43:27,053
Hell, I've even used him myself.

00:43:27,910 --> 00:43:29,570
Never for wetwork, though.

00:43:34,870 --> 00:43:39,330
Maybe he was doin' some
small side job for Sergei

00:43:39,330 --> 00:43:41,973
and walked in on the hit?

00:43:41,973 --> 00:43:42,806
- Find him.

00:43:42,806 --> 00:43:45,453
And put a couple of eyes
on the Blue Parrot as well.

00:43:55,650 --> 00:43:57,843
James, does Sergei trust you?

00:44:02,215 --> 00:44:04,190
- I've been loyal to him
for the last six months.

00:44:04,190 --> 00:44:05,450
Took a bullet for his family.

00:44:05,450 --> 00:44:08,621
Yeah, I think he trusts me all right.

00:44:08,621 --> 00:44:09,550
- Good.

00:44:09,550 --> 00:44:11,383
I want you to go to him tomorrow.

00:44:12,510 --> 00:44:13,783
See what he knows.

00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:19,860
Let me know when possibly
we might finish the job

00:44:20,850 --> 00:44:22,113
somebody else started.

00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:25,900
Do you understand?

00:44:28,343 --> 00:44:30,260
- I understand.

00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:32,073
- Well, that's excellent.

00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:44,123
But be careful.

00:44:46,170 --> 00:44:47,563
Do you follow me?

00:44:48,490 --> 00:44:49,323
- Yes, sir.

00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:52,670
- Good night to you, James.

00:45:05,994 --> 00:45:08,244
(groaning)

00:45:11,996 --> 00:45:14,746
(dramatic music)

00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:37,570
(knocking)

00:45:39,573 --> 00:45:40,635
- Yes?

00:45:40,635 --> 00:45:41,468
- Renault.

00:45:49,494 --> 00:45:50,327
Bonjour.

00:45:50,327 --> 00:45:51,160
- Sava.

00:45:53,185 --> 00:45:54,887
- Breakfast delivery.

00:45:54,887 --> 00:45:56,343
Espresso and croissants.

00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:01,700
- [Brigit] Who's the third?

00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:02,533
- Luc.

00:46:02,533 --> 00:46:03,366
He's on the way.

00:46:05,725 --> 00:46:10,475
Hey, I haven't had a decent
croissant since I left Paris.

00:46:12,340 --> 00:46:13,740
- What's the word on the street?

00:46:13,740 --> 00:46:14,573
- No word.

00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,003
And no one has any idea who did the job.

00:46:19,250 --> 00:46:20,910
- Not the whole job.

00:46:20,910 --> 00:46:21,940
- No.

00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:23,670
Not the whole job.

00:46:23,670 --> 00:46:25,180
- Well, when can I finish it?

00:46:25,180 --> 00:46:30,023
- After last night, Sergei
certainly will be hard to get to.

00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:34,735
Ah, perhaps we wait.

00:46:34,735 --> 00:46:35,568
- No.

00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:38,900
- Give me one day then.

00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:41,764
Luc and I will do some snooping around

00:46:41,764 --> 00:46:43,190
to see what we can find out.

00:46:43,190 --> 00:46:45,090
- He shouldn't be showing his face.

00:46:45,090 --> 00:46:46,530
- Why not?

00:46:46,530 --> 00:46:48,580
No survivors, were there?

00:46:48,580 --> 00:46:49,413
- No.

00:46:51,410 --> 00:46:52,453
I don't think so.

00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:56,090
No, none.

00:46:56,090 --> 00:46:56,923
- Good.

00:46:56,923 --> 00:46:59,263
And your face certainly
is not known in town.

00:47:00,890 --> 00:47:03,843
Maybe you should do a little sightseeing.

00:47:04,750 --> 00:47:07,173
- Not in the mood to play tourist.

00:47:08,170 --> 00:47:11,865
Besides, I didn't expect to
be seeing anything today.

00:47:11,865 --> 00:47:12,880
- What?

00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:13,713
Why not?

00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:17,663
- I expected to be dead.

00:47:19,010 --> 00:47:21,720
- You weren't confident in your abilities?

00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:22,600
- It's just...

00:47:25,060 --> 00:47:26,817
It's not what I expected.

00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:29,710
I thought it would all be over.

00:47:30,685 --> 00:47:31,518
I'd be dead.

00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:35,398
No more worries.

00:47:35,398 --> 00:47:36,565
No more cares.

00:47:42,456 --> 00:47:44,470
- Don't speak like that.

00:47:44,470 --> 00:47:45,490
You're young.

00:47:45,490 --> 00:47:46,613
You feel too much.

00:47:52,780 --> 00:47:54,683
Tell me, how did Luc do?

00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:56,913
- Fine.

00:47:58,030 --> 00:47:58,863
- Just fine?

00:48:00,677 --> 00:48:01,760
- He was good.

00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:03,290
You were right to use him.

00:48:03,290 --> 00:48:05,070
- I knew he'd do well.

00:48:05,070 --> 00:48:06,505
Just like you.

00:48:06,505 --> 00:48:08,755
(knocking)

00:48:10,170 --> 00:48:11,003
The boy.

00:48:13,660 --> 00:48:14,870
Who is it?

00:48:14,870 --> 00:48:15,820
- [Luc] It's Bogie!

00:48:17,916 --> 00:48:19,666
- [Renault] Hey, hey.

00:48:20,627 --> 00:48:22,437
How are you?

00:48:22,437 --> 00:48:23,333
- How you doing?

00:48:26,860 --> 00:48:29,970
So, (claps) when are we gonna hit Sergei?

00:48:29,970 --> 00:48:31,710
- Look at him, all ready for business!

00:48:31,710 --> 00:48:33,270
- Well, he's alone in the club right now.

00:48:33,270 --> 00:48:34,320
- What?

00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:35,599
- I cruised by.

00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:36,432
Saw him go inside alone.

00:48:36,432 --> 00:48:39,190
Didn't see any of their
thugs, no other cars.

00:48:39,190 --> 00:48:40,550
- Very strange.

00:48:40,550 --> 00:48:41,848
You two stay here.

00:48:41,848 --> 00:48:43,443
I'll check it out, call you from home.

00:48:43,443 --> 00:48:44,276
- Okay.

00:48:52,564 --> 00:48:54,854
It's good to see you.

00:48:54,854 --> 00:48:55,896
- Oh!

00:48:55,896 --> 00:48:57,350
- Are you all right?
- No, it's all right.

00:48:57,350 --> 00:48:59,200
It's just a scratch.
- Are you sure?

00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:03,023
- There's some breakfast
for you if you'd like.

00:49:06,790 --> 00:49:09,190
- We make a good team, don't we?

00:49:09,190 --> 00:49:12,643
At work and play.

00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:18,670
- It was a one-time thing, you and me.

00:49:18,670 --> 00:49:20,320
- You saved my life.

00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:21,553
- And you saved mine.

00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:24,060
We're even.

00:49:24,060 --> 00:49:25,403
- We owe each other.

00:49:26,690 --> 00:49:28,010
It's a rule.

00:49:28,010 --> 00:49:31,240
We have to take care of each
other forever or, or something.

00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:33,670
Isn't that how it goes?

00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:34,863
- Do you like life?

00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:39,060
- Of course.

00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:40,393
- Then find a new job.

00:49:47,355 --> 00:49:50,022
(ominous music)

00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:10,660
- Oh, shut up, and listen to me!

00:50:10,660 --> 00:50:14,950
I want every one of the
Reilly operations watched.

00:50:14,950 --> 00:50:16,890
I want to know where Reilly is.

00:50:16,890 --> 00:50:19,780
I want to know where that
Mick bastard's son is.

00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:22,810
I want those fucking
potato eaters brought to me

00:50:22,810 --> 00:50:24,880
within an inch of their lives.

00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:25,713
Understand?

00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:29,087
- It wasn't the Reillys.

00:50:29,087 --> 00:50:29,920
- What?

00:50:31,410 --> 00:50:32,547
Yes, yes, sit.

00:50:36,350 --> 00:50:37,183
Speak.

00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:39,733
- What are you doing here all alone?

00:50:39,733 --> 00:50:40,566
You should have someone here-

00:50:40,566 --> 00:50:41,690
- I can take care of myself.

00:50:41,690 --> 00:50:43,860
Everyone is out after the Reillys.

00:50:43,860 --> 00:50:44,753
Now, speak.

00:50:45,940 --> 00:50:50,020
- Word on the street is,
it wasn't the Reillys.

00:50:50,020 --> 00:50:51,268
- Bullshit.

00:50:51,268 --> 00:50:53,085
There is no such word on the street.

00:50:53,085 --> 00:50:58,085
The Reillys, they say we
overstepped our boundaries.

00:50:58,100 --> 00:50:58,963
It was them.

00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:00,960
I can feel it.

00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:01,793
- It wasn't.

00:51:03,475 --> 00:51:04,375
- How do you know?

00:51:05,327 --> 00:51:07,977
- I have a friend, he helped
me out with my shoulder.

00:51:09,270 --> 00:51:12,313
He says the Reillys are out
looking for the shooter too.

00:51:13,970 --> 00:51:14,803
To thank him.

00:51:16,615 --> 00:51:19,370
Now, he assures me the Reillys
have no idea who did it.

00:51:19,370 --> 00:51:20,470
- Impossible, how can this be?

00:51:20,470 --> 00:51:21,878
- I don't know.

00:51:21,878 --> 00:51:23,040
I mean, who, who else would have the balls

00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:24,310
to try something like that, huh?

00:51:24,310 --> 00:51:25,830
And why?

00:51:25,830 --> 00:51:27,143
- Good questions.

00:51:28,470 --> 00:51:33,123
But, if this is true, where to start?

00:51:34,610 --> 00:51:38,500
- Well, there's something else.

00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:39,700
- What, what else, what?

00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:45,590
Don't fuck with me.

00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:48,283
My family is dead.

00:51:49,214 --> 00:51:50,853
I have nothing left but hate.

00:51:52,110 --> 00:51:55,223
To kill you would be a welcome diversion.

00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:01,973
- I'm not sure, but when I was down,

00:52:02,860 --> 00:52:05,334
before I passed out,
I think I saw Renault.

00:52:05,334 --> 00:52:06,860
- Renault?

00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:08,130
You are sure?

00:52:08,130 --> 00:52:09,150
- I'm pretty sure.

00:52:09,150 --> 00:52:12,753
He wasn't one of the
shooters, but he was there.

00:52:15,530 --> 00:52:16,580
- It's a start.

00:52:22,364 --> 00:52:24,973
Find him, bring him here.

00:52:25,862 --> 00:52:26,695
Alive.

00:52:35,338 --> 00:52:37,755
(gun clicks)

00:52:49,220 --> 00:52:50,320
- Hey, check this out.

00:52:59,620 --> 00:53:00,453
Come on.

00:53:01,810 --> 00:53:02,890
Watch the movie with me.

00:53:02,890 --> 00:53:04,203
It'll help pass the time.

00:53:10,114 --> 00:53:12,114
I love these old flicks.

00:53:14,090 --> 00:53:15,140
- This is a good one.

00:53:17,190 --> 00:53:18,240
Everyone's a bad guy.

00:53:20,190 --> 00:53:21,040
Except the bimbo.

00:53:26,710 --> 00:53:28,310
She's gonna get them all killed.

00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:35,110
- Well, thanks for ruining the ending.

00:53:37,473 --> 00:53:39,173
- Well, they all end the same way.

00:53:46,490 --> 00:53:47,760
- James.

00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:49,560
How you flying there on one wing?

00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:50,940
- Oh, I'm fine, Mr. Reilly.

00:53:50,940 --> 00:53:52,260
Thanks for asking.

00:53:52,260 --> 00:53:54,407
- So then, what's the news?

00:53:55,910 --> 00:53:57,970
- Sergei's out sweeping the city.

00:53:57,970 --> 00:53:59,932
He's still not convinced it wasn't you.

00:53:59,932 --> 00:54:02,015
(laughs)

00:54:02,863 --> 00:54:04,200
- Well, is he covered?

00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:05,033
- No, not really.

00:54:05,033 --> 00:54:09,610
He sent me out to look for Renault.

00:54:09,610 --> 00:54:10,523
- No need.

00:54:14,070 --> 00:54:15,540
- Why not?

00:54:15,540 --> 00:54:16,970
- You must've made good
time from the club.

00:54:16,970 --> 00:54:18,550
You beat 'em here.

00:54:18,550 --> 00:54:19,810
Into the kitchen with you.

00:54:19,810 --> 00:54:20,643
- Yes, sir.

00:54:24,493 --> 00:54:26,910
(slow music)

00:54:48,862 --> 00:54:50,850
- Here.
- Thanks.

00:54:50,850 --> 00:54:54,963
- Renault is your name?

00:54:54,963 --> 00:54:55,796
- Yes.

00:54:56,870 --> 00:54:58,363
- Do you know where you are?

00:54:59,770 --> 00:55:02,660
- I would make an educated
guess I am in the presence

00:55:02,660 --> 00:55:04,930
of Mr. Michael Reilly.

00:55:04,930 --> 00:55:05,853
- Indeed you are.

00:55:06,893 --> 00:55:07,726
Have we met?

00:55:10,630 --> 00:55:11,530
- A few years ago.

00:55:12,450 --> 00:55:13,720
You wouldn't remember me.

00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:16,140
It was a party at your home.

00:55:16,140 --> 00:55:17,300
- Aha.

00:55:17,300 --> 00:55:19,350
Well, you're right, I don't remember you.

00:55:28,380 --> 00:55:31,030
- Michael Jr., are you here?

00:55:31,030 --> 00:55:32,205
- I am.

00:55:32,205 --> 00:55:33,693
Do you know why you're here, Renault?

00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:36,410
- I don't have a clue.

00:55:36,410 --> 00:55:38,340
- We're looking for information.

00:55:38,340 --> 00:55:40,027
- Well, I will gladly be of help if I can.

00:55:40,027 --> 00:55:40,973
You know that.

00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:42,833
- Perhaps.

00:55:43,910 --> 00:55:47,693
Who contracted the hit on the Karpovs?

00:55:49,460 --> 00:55:50,760
- I don't know.

00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:51,713
No one does.

00:55:53,650 --> 00:55:55,360
Many think you did it.

00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:56,763
- Do you believe that?

00:55:58,980 --> 00:55:59,813
- I don't know.

00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:04,320
- We didn't do it.

00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:05,990
But you know who did.

00:56:05,990 --> 00:56:07,090
- Me?

00:56:07,090 --> 00:56:08,330
No.

00:56:08,330 --> 00:56:09,180
How could I know?

00:56:14,980 --> 00:56:17,463
- You were there.

00:56:24,701 --> 00:56:26,784
(smacks)

00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:30,493
Do you recognize him?

00:56:34,170 --> 00:56:35,043
- Bartender.

00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:37,920
- At the Blue Parrot.

00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:39,000
He was there.

00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,813
He says you were there.

00:56:42,061 --> 00:56:42,894
- No.

00:56:42,894 --> 00:56:44,273
- Who contracted the hit?

00:56:47,689 --> 00:56:49,210
(smacks)

00:56:49,210 --> 00:56:53,823
Is another family thinking
about moving into town?

00:56:57,493 --> 00:56:58,830
(smacks)

00:56:58,830 --> 00:56:59,893
Are we targets?

00:57:01,690 --> 00:57:02,523
- Don't know.

00:57:04,012 --> 00:57:07,393
Sergei probably coming for you.

00:57:12,070 --> 00:57:14,370
- Whatever you're getting
can't be worth this.

00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:18,113
We know you're talented,
and we know you're loyal.

00:57:19,210 --> 00:57:21,200
With you on our team,

00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:24,570
we could send the whole
Karpov organization to hell.

00:57:24,570 --> 00:57:27,340
And anyone else who tried to muscle in.

00:57:27,340 --> 00:57:29,210
You're on the payroll.

00:57:29,210 --> 00:57:30,053
Full time.

00:57:30,982 --> 00:57:31,815
What do you say?

00:57:33,093 --> 00:57:35,343
(mumbling)

00:57:37,052 --> 00:57:39,469
Anyhow, that's disappointing.

00:57:40,671 --> 00:57:42,754
(smacks)

00:57:44,780 --> 00:57:47,000
- Have we gone through his place yet?

00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,200
- Sean's over there now.

00:57:49,180 --> 00:57:51,027
- Paddy, go help him.

00:57:58,644 --> 00:58:01,311
(phone ringing)

00:58:13,370 --> 00:58:15,360
- He would've called by now.

00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:16,330
- Be patient.

00:58:16,330 --> 00:58:17,410
- I'm gonna go look for him.

00:58:17,410 --> 00:58:18,760
- Well, stay away from the club.

00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:20,163
- I'll try his place.

00:58:21,030 --> 00:58:23,260
Then I'll just drive by the club.

00:58:23,260 --> 00:58:24,093
Discreetly.

00:58:26,464 --> 00:58:27,297
Okay?

00:58:29,532 --> 00:58:30,684
You'll be here?

00:58:30,684 --> 00:58:31,934
- I'll be here.

00:58:38,860 --> 00:58:40,230
- Good.

00:58:40,230 --> 00:58:41,550
Just keep an eye on the place.

00:58:41,550 --> 00:58:43,753
If he leaves, I want to know.

00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:46,690
Karpov's still at the club.

00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:48,920
- He say anything else?

00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:49,753
- Nope.

00:58:51,930 --> 00:58:53,463
He's done talking.

00:58:54,770 --> 00:58:56,220
Sorry, Dad.

00:58:56,220 --> 00:58:57,470
We were too much for him.

00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:04,400
- Last week, he rented a loft for someone.

00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:05,233
Month to month.

00:59:05,233 --> 00:59:06,210
Near the Blue Parrot.

00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:07,953
- Go then!

00:59:09,690 --> 00:59:10,940
- Sean, stay here.

00:59:22,952 --> 00:59:25,060
(dramatic music)

00:59:25,060 --> 00:59:25,893
- [Paddy] Don't.

00:59:29,910 --> 00:59:31,610
- Wanna go for a ride, sweetheart?

00:59:32,910 --> 00:59:33,743
- Why not?

00:59:36,625 --> 00:59:38,313
Will I be coming back?

00:59:38,313 --> 00:59:39,513
- Now, that's up to you.

00:59:40,770 --> 00:59:42,363
- Mind if I bring a few things?

01:00:12,170 --> 01:00:14,213
- Now, James, go back in the kitchen.

01:00:35,545 --> 01:00:37,540
So you're the shooter be damned.

01:00:39,806 --> 01:00:41,460
- Shooter?

01:00:41,460 --> 01:00:43,382
What do you mean, shooter?

01:00:43,382 --> 01:00:44,830
- I've no patience for games.

01:00:44,830 --> 01:00:46,180
Now, get that off her face.

01:00:51,220 --> 01:00:53,610
My name is Michael Reilly.

01:00:53,610 --> 01:00:55,070
- I've heard of you.

01:00:55,070 --> 01:00:56,983
- And here's Michael Jr.

01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:00,997
- We've met.

01:01:00,997 --> 01:01:02,243
- And you are?

01:01:03,288 --> 01:01:04,550
- Brigit.

01:01:04,550 --> 01:01:06,730
- You're too young for
this line of work, Brigit.

01:01:06,730 --> 01:01:08,260
Brigit who?

01:01:08,260 --> 01:01:09,110
- Does it matter?

01:01:10,732 --> 01:01:11,565
- No.

01:01:15,860 --> 01:01:17,980
You hit the Karpovs.

01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:21,713
- Yes.

01:01:23,181 --> 01:01:24,014
- That was quick.

01:01:24,014 --> 01:01:25,850
- Well, I have no reason to lie.

01:01:25,850 --> 01:01:28,910
I thought I probably
wouldn't even be alive today.

01:01:28,910 --> 01:01:33,663
So at this point, every
minute is an unforeseen bonus.

01:01:34,870 --> 01:01:38,020
- Who paid you to kill the Karpovs?

01:01:38,860 --> 01:01:40,253
- They're not all dead yet.

01:01:41,460 --> 01:01:43,233
- Allow me to rephrase.

01:01:44,110 --> 01:01:46,110
After you've killed Sergei,

01:01:46,110 --> 01:01:49,430
who will pay you for
having killed the Karpovs?

01:01:51,590 --> 01:01:54,170
- Must one always kill for money?

01:01:54,170 --> 01:01:56,770
I mean, whatever happened to passion?

01:01:56,770 --> 01:01:58,460
- Ah, the first hurdle.

01:01:58,460 --> 01:02:00,028
It's to be a dance then.

01:02:00,028 --> 01:02:02,400
(thumping)

01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:04,453
Paddy, get him out of the pantry.

01:02:07,090 --> 01:02:12,090
Did some relative or friend
of the Sandovals contact you?

01:02:14,249 --> 01:02:15,590
- No.

01:02:15,590 --> 01:02:18,610
- Then the next logical assumption is

01:02:18,610 --> 01:02:23,110
another family is moving in
on the Karpovs' businesses.

01:02:23,110 --> 01:02:23,943
Is that it?

01:02:24,780 --> 01:02:26,003
- Not to my knowledge.

01:02:26,940 --> 01:02:29,070
It'll be all yours when I'm finished.

01:02:29,070 --> 01:02:31,160
- [Michael] And nobody's paying you?

01:02:31,160 --> 01:02:31,993
- No one.

01:02:33,060 --> 01:02:36,050
- She's just doing it out of
the goodness of her heart.

01:02:36,050 --> 01:02:38,110
- Goodness has nothing to do with this.

01:02:38,110 --> 01:02:41,010
- Why then are you doing it?

01:02:41,010 --> 01:02:43,350
- Well, if you're not
harmed or implicated,

01:02:43,350 --> 01:02:45,170
and you benefit from the result,

01:02:45,170 --> 01:02:47,960
my reason should be of no concern to you.

01:02:47,960 --> 01:02:51,170
- You see, that's where
you're quite mistaken.

01:02:51,170 --> 01:02:54,163
We live in a world of information.

01:02:55,310 --> 01:02:58,880
Information can have great value.

01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:02,230
Barter currency, as it were.

01:03:02,230 --> 01:03:04,000
I like information.

01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,260
I like knowing things.

01:03:06,260 --> 01:03:09,887
I like knowing what's going
on inside of my city and why.

01:03:09,887 --> 01:03:12,060
Do you get that?

01:03:12,060 --> 01:03:14,290
- That's all quite fascinating.

01:03:14,290 --> 01:03:16,990
But my reason is my own.

01:03:16,990 --> 01:03:19,300
It's personal, all right?

01:03:19,300 --> 01:03:23,090
Now, just let me go, and
I'll finish what I started,

01:03:23,090 --> 01:03:24,360
and I'll be on my way.

01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:25,913
You'll never see me again.

01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:30,420
- Not good enough.

01:03:31,430 --> 01:03:34,398
You've gotta tell me what I'm
asking if you want to live.

01:03:34,398 --> 01:03:35,598
If you don't, you won't.

01:03:37,591 --> 01:03:40,174
(Brigit gasps)

01:03:41,988 --> 01:03:43,321
Do you know him?

01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:45,793
- Yes.

01:03:50,590 --> 01:03:51,563
- He hired you?

01:03:52,840 --> 01:03:55,193
- I already told you, no one hired me.

01:03:56,060 --> 01:03:56,893
- He helped you?

01:04:00,289 --> 01:04:01,122
- Yes.

01:04:03,290 --> 01:04:04,123
- Tell me.

01:04:05,691 --> 01:04:06,941
Please, Brigit?

01:04:12,830 --> 01:04:13,683
- I'll tell you.

01:04:15,661 --> 01:04:16,494
All of it.

01:04:17,407 --> 01:04:19,543
But just to you and your son.

01:04:20,420 --> 01:04:21,343
You understand?

01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:25,183
Just to the two of you.

01:04:29,350 --> 01:04:32,760
- Paddy, you, Jimmy,
and Sean go have a pint.

01:04:32,760 --> 01:04:33,600
Play some darts.

01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:35,160
Go down to the pub.

01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:36,460
- [Paddy] Yes, Mr. Reilly.

01:04:46,650 --> 01:04:49,603
- I was born in Paris, and
I grew up in the Pyrenees.

01:04:50,677 --> 01:04:51,713
- [Michael] You're French?

01:04:52,670 --> 01:04:55,780
(speaking in foreign language)

01:04:55,780 --> 01:04:59,470
- Well, my mother was English,
and my father was French,

01:04:59,470 --> 01:05:00,387
so (speaking in foreign language).

01:05:02,909 --> 01:05:04,050
- All right.

01:05:04,050 --> 01:05:04,883
Go on.

01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:10,443
- There was just my
mother, my father, and me.

01:05:11,430 --> 01:05:12,773
We had land.

01:05:14,080 --> 01:05:14,933
A small vineyard.

01:05:17,839 --> 01:05:19,239
It was a simple, happy life.

01:05:20,950 --> 01:05:22,860
My father was tending to the land,

01:05:22,860 --> 01:05:25,489
and my mother and I were in the house.

01:05:25,489 --> 01:05:29,406
(speaking in foreign language)

01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:46,160
- We're celebrating Papa's first sale

01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:47,850
of our inaugural vintage.

01:05:47,850 --> 01:05:49,770
- You mean he actually sold?

01:05:49,770 --> 01:05:51,360
- Be nice.

01:05:51,360 --> 01:05:53,550
Look, if you work hard,

01:05:53,550 --> 01:05:57,150
one day you'll be able to
take over the family business.

01:05:57,150 --> 01:05:58,450
- I'm sorry.

01:05:58,450 --> 01:05:59,660
I can't.

01:05:59,660 --> 01:06:02,190
I'm going to be a singer.

01:06:02,190 --> 01:06:03,023
- Oh!

01:06:04,638 --> 01:06:07,221
(upbeat music)

01:06:10,740 --> 01:06:12,033
- We heard a car coming.

01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:26,940
To me, they all looked
happy, they were laughing.

01:06:26,940 --> 01:06:29,340
I looked at my mother,
and she was worried.

01:06:29,340 --> 01:06:31,090
She could see that they were drunk.

01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:34,447
They had run out of liquor, beer.

01:06:44,070 --> 01:06:46,550
(gasps)

01:06:46,550 --> 01:06:48,077
My father didn't have a gun.

01:06:50,154 --> 01:06:51,810
(dramatic music)

01:06:51,810 --> 01:06:52,810
- Oh my god!

01:06:53,876 --> 01:06:57,045
- They shot him just like that.

01:06:57,045 --> 01:06:58,212
For no reason.

01:06:59,674 --> 01:07:02,007
(screaming)

01:07:04,826 --> 01:07:07,409
(man laughing)

01:07:15,499 --> 01:07:17,666
(gasping)

01:07:23,305 --> 01:07:25,638
(screaming)

01:07:34,809 --> 01:07:36,809
(gasps)

01:07:54,337 --> 01:07:56,420
Well, I did what I could.

01:07:57,426 --> 01:07:58,259
Nothing.

01:08:04,995 --> 01:08:06,556
George was first.

01:08:06,556 --> 01:08:08,723
(gasping)

01:08:10,056 --> 01:08:12,473
(speaking in foreign language)

01:08:12,473 --> 01:08:13,850
Then Natalya.

01:08:13,850 --> 01:08:15,180
Sergei was next.

01:08:15,180 --> 01:08:17,123
And then Peter took his turn.

01:08:31,570 --> 01:08:32,583
- Never heard of it.

01:08:39,930 --> 01:08:41,213
- They weren't finished.

01:08:49,387 --> 01:08:53,304
(speaking in foreign language)

01:09:01,967 --> 01:09:04,300
(gun fires)

01:09:15,470 --> 01:09:17,283
They left me for dead.

01:09:21,802 --> 01:09:24,219
(slow music)

01:09:28,955 --> 01:09:32,960
Our neighbor, Renault, heard the shots,

01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:34,300
but he came too late.

01:10:36,070 --> 01:10:37,580
Renault tended to my wounds,

01:10:37,580 --> 01:10:39,193
and most of them healed quickly.

01:10:40,260 --> 01:10:43,470
He was moving to America,
so he sold the vineyard

01:10:43,470 --> 01:10:46,060
and some of my family's land for me,

01:10:46,060 --> 01:10:49,170
and put me in boarding
school in Northern England.

01:10:49,170 --> 01:10:51,640
- That is a sad tale, to be sure.

01:10:51,640 --> 01:10:54,300
However, it could be just that.

01:10:54,300 --> 01:10:55,133
A tale.

01:10:56,530 --> 01:11:00,133
- Well, believe me or kill me right now.

01:11:01,480 --> 01:11:05,283
But promise me you will finish off Sergei.

01:11:07,300 --> 01:11:08,483
- I don't understand.

01:11:09,950 --> 01:11:12,170
I mean, what were the
Karpovs even doing there?

01:11:12,170 --> 01:11:14,670
- It took me years to find that out.

01:11:14,670 --> 01:11:15,930
It was before the Wall fell.

01:11:15,930 --> 01:11:18,090
Apparently, Sergei and
George were small-time hoods

01:11:18,090 --> 01:11:20,560
behind the Curtain up in the Baltics.

01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:22,183
Their name was Korchev then.

01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:27,950
They ended up in jail, and Peter
and Natalya broke them out.

01:11:27,950 --> 01:11:30,610
They escaped to the West.

01:11:30,610 --> 01:11:34,180
Drank and robbed their way
around the Continent for a while.

01:11:34,180 --> 01:11:37,670
I found out mine wasn't the
only family they visited.

01:11:37,670 --> 01:11:41,150
They were on a drinking, killing binge,

01:11:41,150 --> 01:11:43,563
celebrating their freedom, if you will.

01:11:46,900 --> 01:11:50,683
They killed my mother
and father for no reason.

01:11:51,570 --> 01:11:53,787
For no good reason at all.

01:11:56,660 --> 01:11:59,273
Interpol got onto their
trail, but they got away.

01:12:00,290 --> 01:12:03,133
To America, the land of opportunity.

01:12:04,060 --> 01:12:06,433
Changed their name and went into business.

01:12:07,720 --> 01:12:09,043
- And Renault?

01:12:10,004 --> 01:12:13,100
- I was trying to trace
them here in the States.

01:12:13,100 --> 01:12:17,080
I sold the last of my family's
land, and I hired Renault.

01:12:17,080 --> 01:12:19,385
- You hired Renault?

01:12:19,385 --> 01:12:20,760
- I hired Renault.

01:12:20,760 --> 01:12:22,240
To track down the Karpovs.

01:12:24,700 --> 01:12:25,600
And he found them.

01:12:28,130 --> 01:12:30,510
Did he tell you where?

01:12:30,510 --> 01:12:32,083
- He told us nothing.

01:12:34,440 --> 01:12:37,233
He never gave you up, in
case you were wondering.

01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:39,433
Continue.

01:12:41,290 --> 01:12:44,173
- While at university, I
trained for this one job.

01:12:46,140 --> 01:12:48,930
I developed the skills I thought I'd need.

01:12:48,930 --> 01:12:51,833
Research, computers, fitness, weapons.

01:12:52,670 --> 01:12:54,090
I worked a few odd jobs

01:12:54,090 --> 01:12:56,683
that could get me access
to international records.

01:12:59,080 --> 01:13:00,230
Then the time had come.

01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:03,563
My hate kept me going.

01:13:04,820 --> 01:13:06,150
I was ready.

01:13:06,150 --> 01:13:10,603
- Why didn't you just
come to me at the start?

01:13:11,490 --> 01:13:14,140
Surely you must've known
we'd be open to helping you.

01:13:16,840 --> 01:13:18,817
- It had to be personal.

01:13:24,200 --> 01:13:29,200
- You've proved yourself
quite talented at the game.

01:13:30,520 --> 01:13:31,513
You're gifted.

01:13:33,960 --> 01:13:36,800
How do you fancy a job working for me?

01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:38,763
It can be a lucrative business.

01:13:44,480 --> 01:13:46,523
- Well, I'll think about it.

01:13:48,770 --> 01:13:51,193
Now, please, let me go.

01:13:54,622 --> 01:13:56,039
Let me finish it.

01:14:04,455 --> 01:14:07,259
(door bangs)

01:14:07,259 --> 01:14:08,759
- Whoa, whoa, hey.

01:14:10,690 --> 01:14:11,659
You all right?

01:14:11,659 --> 01:14:13,159
- My family's dead, you idiot.

01:14:16,040 --> 01:14:17,000
- What would it be worth to you

01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,300
if I knew where the main
shooter was holed up?

01:14:23,800 --> 01:14:24,633
- Your life.

01:14:25,807 --> 01:14:28,933
- Mr. Karpov, a man's
gotta know his worth, huh?

01:14:38,190 --> 01:14:39,023
How much?

01:14:39,970 --> 01:14:40,970
- All of it.

01:14:41,858 --> 01:14:42,881
Tell me.

01:14:42,881 --> 01:14:44,163
Do you know where the shooter is?

01:14:45,139 --> 01:14:47,040
- Yeah, I think so.

01:14:47,040 --> 01:14:48,410
- How?

01:14:48,410 --> 01:14:49,803
- The Reillys found her.

01:14:52,230 --> 01:14:53,063
- Her?

01:14:54,030 --> 01:14:55,293
Her, a fucking woman?

01:14:56,130 --> 01:14:56,963
- [Jimmy] Yep.

01:14:59,420 --> 01:15:00,800
- Fuck me.

01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:04,233
- The Reillys picked her up,
but then they let her go.

01:15:06,710 --> 01:15:09,080
- So she could finish the job.

01:15:09,080 --> 01:15:09,980
- [Jimmy] Exactly.

01:15:14,070 --> 01:15:16,010
- Find out who hired her?

01:15:16,010 --> 01:15:17,303
- I don't know.

01:15:17,303 --> 01:15:20,120
My source was sent away while
the Reillys questioned her.

01:15:20,120 --> 01:15:22,320
But he waited outside down the street,

01:15:22,320 --> 01:15:24,400
saw her when she came out.

01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:26,750
Michael Jr. put her in
a cab and sent her home.

01:15:28,205 --> 01:15:30,200
The Reillys didn't even tail her.

01:15:30,200 --> 01:15:32,090
- So, where is she?

01:15:32,090 --> 01:15:33,800
- Well, I tipped back a
few beers with my friend,

01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:36,150
and he gave me the address
where she's staying.

01:15:37,110 --> 01:15:38,521
- [Sergei] Let's go.

01:15:38,521 --> 01:15:39,354
- Wait, wait, wait.

01:15:39,354 --> 01:15:40,369
Not yet.

01:15:40,369 --> 01:15:41,202
- What?

01:15:42,110 --> 01:15:43,810
- Why don't you let me make
you a little coffee first?

01:15:43,810 --> 01:15:46,248
You're gonna want to be sharp, huh?

01:15:46,248 --> 01:15:47,248
- All right.

01:16:00,118 --> 01:16:01,560
- [Luc] Where were you?

01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:02,393
- I...

01:16:03,658 --> 01:16:04,670
- [Luc] Are you all right?

01:16:04,670 --> 01:16:05,503
- I'm okay.

01:16:05,503 --> 01:16:06,336
I'm okay.

01:16:10,110 --> 01:16:11,890
- Have you seen my dad?

01:16:11,890 --> 01:16:12,723
- Your dad?

01:16:12,723 --> 01:16:13,556
- [Luc] My dad.

01:16:15,100 --> 01:16:16,140
- Renault?

01:16:16,140 --> 01:16:16,973
- [Luc] Yes.

01:16:18,210 --> 01:16:19,310
- Is your father?

01:16:19,310 --> 01:16:20,470
- Yes.

01:16:20,470 --> 01:16:21,480
My mom raised me in London.

01:16:21,480 --> 01:16:22,760
I came out here a couple of years ago.

01:16:22,760 --> 01:16:23,710
I thought you knew.

01:16:24,730 --> 01:16:26,083
- No, I didn't know.

01:16:28,920 --> 01:16:33,920
- So, what, where is he?

01:16:34,390 --> 01:16:38,470
- The Reillys, they picked me up.

01:16:38,470 --> 01:16:39,710
- Well, how'd they find you?

01:16:39,710 --> 01:16:40,847
- Well, I don't know.

01:16:40,847 --> 01:16:42,047
But they caught Renault.

01:16:43,100 --> 01:16:44,873
Luc, they interrogated him.

01:16:46,500 --> 01:16:48,300
He was dead by the time I got there.

01:16:50,819 --> 01:16:52,383
I'm sorry.

01:16:54,050 --> 01:16:54,883
I'm sorry.

01:17:03,558 --> 01:17:05,641
(crying)

01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:12,753
- No, no!

01:17:14,759 --> 01:17:15,592
Father!

01:17:18,288 --> 01:17:19,121
Dammit!

01:17:21,005 --> 01:17:23,088
(crying)

01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:44,599
Did he say anything?

01:17:44,599 --> 01:17:46,643
- No, they said he
didn't tell them a thing.

01:17:51,478 --> 01:17:53,395
- The stubborn bastard.

01:18:04,567 --> 01:18:05,567
- He was a good man.

01:18:07,040 --> 01:18:08,343
He took care of me.

01:18:13,237 --> 01:18:14,337
- He knew how to live.

01:18:16,660 --> 01:18:18,093
Full of life every minute.

01:18:39,567 --> 01:18:41,397
(phone dialing)

01:18:41,397 --> 01:18:43,438
(phone ringing)

01:18:43,438 --> 01:18:44,300
- MJ.

01:18:44,300 --> 01:18:45,140
- This is Paddy.

01:18:45,140 --> 01:18:46,050
You were right.

01:18:46,050 --> 01:18:47,360
Jimmy's playing both sides.

01:18:47,360 --> 01:18:48,850
He gave me the slip at the pub,

01:18:48,850 --> 01:18:50,760
but I just found him at the Blue Parrot.

01:18:50,760 --> 01:18:51,593
- Go on.

01:18:51,593 --> 01:18:53,040
- He's with Karpov.

01:18:53,040 --> 01:18:54,690
They're pulling away.

01:18:54,690 --> 01:18:56,240
- They're going after the girl.

01:18:57,300 --> 01:18:59,530
- If they catch up with
that sweet piece of action,

01:18:59,530 --> 01:19:00,853
I want front row seats.

01:19:01,960 --> 01:19:03,283
- I'd like to be there too,

01:19:04,588 --> 01:19:06,530
to see Sergei go down.

01:19:06,530 --> 01:19:08,660
Paddy, follow 'em.

01:19:08,660 --> 01:19:10,750
Wait for us outside her place.

01:19:10,750 --> 01:19:11,583
- Yes, sir.

01:19:17,278 --> 01:19:19,890
- [Luc] So what's the plan?

01:19:19,890 --> 01:19:22,130
- I have to find a new place.

01:19:22,130 --> 01:19:25,830
I can't have the Reillys or
anyone knowing where I am.

01:19:25,830 --> 01:19:26,713
- Stay with me.

01:19:27,770 --> 01:19:29,100
- No.

01:19:29,100 --> 01:19:30,300
They found Renault.

01:19:30,300 --> 01:19:31,133
They found me.

01:19:31,133 --> 01:19:33,040
They will find you.

01:19:33,040 --> 01:19:34,560
We've both got to move.

01:19:34,560 --> 01:19:35,393
- Okay.

01:19:35,393 --> 01:19:36,463
Well, when we're done here,

01:19:37,370 --> 01:19:40,350
I'll pick up my stuff and
we'll find a place together.

01:19:40,350 --> 01:19:41,560
- I don't think so.

01:19:41,560 --> 01:19:42,503
- Well, why not?

01:19:43,490 --> 01:19:44,620
- I said no.

01:19:44,620 --> 01:19:46,470
- We make a great team.

01:19:46,470 --> 01:19:48,053
- I can't think past tomorrow.

01:19:49,040 --> 01:19:50,690
It would be safer if we split up.

01:19:51,789 --> 01:19:52,622
- But we still have a job to finish.

01:19:52,622 --> 01:19:54,380
- I know!

01:19:54,380 --> 01:19:55,213
I know.

01:19:56,170 --> 01:19:57,460
There's only one target left.

01:19:57,460 --> 01:19:59,019
I will take him alone.

01:19:59,019 --> 01:19:59,852
- No.

01:20:01,430 --> 01:20:03,383
No, there is more than one target.

01:20:05,320 --> 01:20:08,070
(dramatic music)

01:20:58,230 --> 01:20:59,983
- How do you want to handle this?

01:20:59,983 --> 01:21:00,816
- I'll handle it.

01:21:00,816 --> 01:21:02,970
Very slowly, very painfully, she will die.

01:21:02,970 --> 01:21:04,170
- Where do you want us?

01:21:04,170 --> 01:21:05,003
- Stay here.

01:21:05,003 --> 01:21:06,593
I do not want to be disturbed.

01:21:06,593 --> 01:21:07,676
- You got it.

01:21:33,894 --> 01:21:35,227
- One last stop.

01:21:55,878 --> 01:21:58,295
(slow music)

01:22:12,640 --> 01:22:14,730
- Jimmy and Karpov just went in.

01:22:14,730 --> 01:22:16,180
There's two in the courtyard.

01:22:20,738 --> 01:22:23,989
(dramatic music)

01:22:23,989 --> 01:22:28,989
- [Sergei] Hello, young lady.

01:22:29,180 --> 01:22:30,013
- Hello, Jimmy.

01:22:32,610 --> 01:22:34,033
- Not what I expected.

01:22:35,800 --> 01:22:37,173
You can't be.

01:22:38,190 --> 01:22:39,790
- Maybe I'm not.

01:22:39,790 --> 01:22:40,623
- Oh no.

01:22:40,623 --> 01:22:41,840
It's her all right, Sergei.

01:22:41,840 --> 01:22:43,220
Trust me.

01:22:43,220 --> 01:22:44,470
- That's a good one.

01:22:44,470 --> 01:22:49,213
- I was expecting someone
a bit more impressive.

01:22:50,760 --> 01:22:52,160
- I'll try harder next time.

01:22:55,057 --> 01:22:57,390
(whistling)

01:23:05,919 --> 01:23:08,419
(guns firing)

01:23:17,169 --> 01:23:19,038
- One question.

01:23:19,038 --> 01:23:19,871
And then?

01:23:23,610 --> 01:23:24,443
Now sit down.

01:23:33,469 --> 01:23:36,219
Now you will tell me who and why.

01:23:43,107 --> 01:23:45,409
- But that's two questions.

01:23:45,409 --> 01:23:47,492
(smacks)

01:23:48,388 --> 01:23:50,471
(laughs)

01:23:52,660 --> 01:23:54,453
- Now you answer!

01:23:55,510 --> 01:23:57,463
Who and why?

01:23:59,270 --> 01:24:01,190
- Well, my question is,

01:24:01,190 --> 01:24:03,633
who is your boy Jimmy really working for?

01:24:04,569 --> 01:24:05,402
And why?

01:24:05,402 --> 01:24:06,543
- Shut up!

01:24:06,543 --> 01:24:08,788
(gasps)

01:24:08,788 --> 01:24:09,788
(guns firing)

01:24:09,788 --> 01:24:11,871
(grunts)

01:24:23,880 --> 01:24:24,713
- Bravo.

01:24:26,080 --> 01:24:27,513
Bravo, very impressive.

01:24:37,050 --> 01:24:37,883
- You.

01:24:38,970 --> 01:24:41,300
It was you all along!

01:24:41,300 --> 01:24:42,560
- Ah.

01:24:42,560 --> 01:24:43,630
'Fraid not, Sergei.

01:24:43,630 --> 01:24:45,167
Wish it was.

01:24:45,167 --> 01:24:46,483
But it was her.

01:24:47,900 --> 01:24:49,083
On her own.

01:24:50,210 --> 01:24:52,640
She wanted you all to herself.

01:24:52,640 --> 01:24:54,337
Said it was personal.

01:24:58,930 --> 01:25:00,923
- It's been a long time.

01:25:03,160 --> 01:25:03,993
- Why?

01:25:08,600 --> 01:25:10,193
- Ever heard of this vineyard?

01:25:11,290 --> 01:25:13,013
Faure Vineyards?

01:25:15,210 --> 01:25:16,403
A fine burgundy.

01:25:17,750 --> 01:25:19,403
My name is Brigit Faure.

01:25:21,678 --> 01:25:25,920
And this is the last bottle
of a once-promising vineyard.

01:25:25,920 --> 01:25:27,809
My family's vineyard.

01:25:27,809 --> 01:25:29,008
(glass smashing)

01:25:29,008 --> 01:25:31,258
(groaning)

01:25:35,109 --> 01:25:40,109
You murdered my family.

01:25:40,900 --> 01:25:42,317
I executed yours.

01:25:48,429 --> 01:25:52,346
(speaking in foreign language)

01:25:55,497 --> 01:25:56,330
Remember?

01:25:59,638 --> 01:26:00,471
Remember?

01:26:01,998 --> 01:26:02,998
- The child?

01:26:05,089 --> 01:26:06,672
- Adieu, mon amour.

01:26:12,937 --> 01:26:17,437
(screams)
(gun fires)

01:26:19,958 --> 01:26:20,958
- Well done.

01:26:24,500 --> 01:26:26,183
Do you have peace now?

01:26:31,190 --> 01:26:32,193
- Almost.

01:26:34,950 --> 01:26:35,783
Luc.

01:26:36,870 --> 01:26:38,100
These are the Reillys.

01:26:40,450 --> 01:26:41,350
Reillys, meet Luc.

01:26:43,960 --> 01:26:45,013
My partner.

01:26:46,960 --> 01:26:48,440
- If you'd like a job,

01:26:48,440 --> 01:26:51,640
I can use a man of your talents as well.

01:26:51,640 --> 01:26:53,260
- Oh, Mr. Reilly.

01:26:53,260 --> 01:26:54,963
I don't think Luc's your man.

01:26:55,840 --> 01:26:58,963
You see, you killed his father today.

01:27:00,019 --> 01:27:01,137
Monsieur Renault.

01:27:01,137 --> 01:27:03,637
(guns firing)

01:27:12,670 --> 01:27:13,503
Come on.

01:27:15,870 --> 01:27:16,703
Come on.

01:27:22,818 --> 01:27:25,151
(gun fires)

01:27:28,435 --> 01:27:29,268
Come on!

01:27:53,898 --> 01:27:56,481
(gentle music)

01:28:34,286 --> 01:28:35,869
Farewell, my loves.

01:28:41,517 --> 01:28:43,600
(kisses)

01:29:22,647 --> 01:29:24,980
- What are you gonna do now?

01:29:37,038 --> 01:29:42,038
Come on.

01:30:15,789 --> 01:30:18,372
