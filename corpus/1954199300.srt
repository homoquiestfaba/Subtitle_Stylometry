00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:28,186
<i>Sweet little Jesus boy</i>

5
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,500
<i>Silent night</i>

6
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:37,183
<i>You'll get through the night</i>

7
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,159
<i>I heard that when a mother bestows</i>

8
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,184
<i>a name on her child,
she reveals her hope.</i>

9
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:50,390
<i>Mine named me Langston, like
the poet, Langston Hughes.</i>

10
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,864
<i>She had great hope for me. But
whatever dreams she had before...</i>

11
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,705
<i>they got deferred in Baltimore.</i>

12
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,462
<i>Been me and her since my
first steps on this earth.</i>

13
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:07,227
<i>My daddy went MIA after my birth.</i>

14
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,382
<i>I used to envy happy
families on the street.</i>

15
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:15,519
<i>After a while,
I chose not to see.</i>

16
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,384
<i>Got to stay strong
for Mom and me.</i>

17
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,746
<i>Unanswered prayers make you weak.</i>

18
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,905
<i>This right here is
a cold, cold town</i>

19
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,901
<i>I don't know why I'm here</i>

20
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:42,062
<i>Or where I am going anymore</i>

21
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:47,744
<i>Mama tried to save me
from the street war</i>

22
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:52,424
<i>But I don't need no savior
Yo, I'm good</i>

23
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,742
<i>Yeah, we 'bout to ride hard</i>

24
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,501
<i>I know I'm young,
but sometimes I feel old</i>

25
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,101
<i>Things I need can't
be bought or sold</i>

26
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,719
<i>A mother's love or a father's name</i>

27
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,107
<i>Nothing heavier than
the weight of shame</i>

28
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,359
<i>I flip my collar so they can't see</i>

29
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,622
<i>The tears fallin' down inside of me</i>

30
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,102
<i>Got to roll out, got things to do</i>

31
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:15,628
<i>Lace up, head up, foot down, move</i>

32
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,302
<i>Walk like you've got a purpose</i>

33
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,227
<i>I can't let them see me nervous</i>

34
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:29,782
<i>'Cause this right here
is the coldest town</i>

35
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,986
<i>You can't let it bring you down</i>

36
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,982
<i>This is my Christmas story.</i>

37
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,065
Yo, yo, yo.

38
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,990
Hey, Ma.

39
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,185
What took you so long?

40
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,104
I ran into Kyle and Snoop.

41
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,191
What's wrong?

42
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,467
We've been evicted?

43
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,540
I thought you were working
it out with the bank.

44
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,021
We'd rent it back.

45
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,069
It's hard to get
that much together.

46
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,626
So we got to move?

47
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,584
Where will we live, Ma?

48
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,991
Why didn't you tell me?
I can help you.

49
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,421
Help me?

50
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,184
You got $5,000? That's what
they want before Christmas.

51
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,582
So you're just letting
them throw us out?

52
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,759
You have no idea what I had to do

53
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,750
just to keep a roof over your
head for the past 15 years.

54
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:01,343
Making sure you got clothes
and you're fed. I did that!

55
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,183
And I'm letting them kick us out?

56
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,101
It's Naima.

57
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,465
I need you to take
Langston for the holidays.

58
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,302
I'm putting him on the 10 A.M. bus.

59
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,879
He gets into Times Square at 1:15.

60
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,301
He'll have this number
and your address.

61
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,065
I hope you get this message.

62
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,341
Who was on the phone?

63
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,501
You're sending me away?

64
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,504
To spend the holidays
with your grandparents.

65
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,742
My grandparents?
I don't even know them.

66
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,146
They live in Harlem.

67
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,941
What about you?

68
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,026
I got to work. We
barely see each other.

69
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,423
- So you're sending me off to strangers?
- They're not strangers.

70
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,701
At Christmas?

71
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:42,023
No. I ain't going.
I ain't leaving you alone.

72
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,102
If I know you're
safe, I'll be okay.

73
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,702
I'll come get you as soon as I can.

74
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:53,786
Langston, I'm just thinking
about what's best for you.

75
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,702
I've done everything I can.

76
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,065
Whatever.

77
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,551
<i>This love in my heart</i>

78
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,585
<i>Is all I have left</i>

79
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,584
<i>That's not enough</i>

80
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,222
<i>But it's my best</i>

81
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:25,425
<i>So I'll set you free</i>

82
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:28,427
<i>Pray that you'll fly</i>

83
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,902
<i>And come back to me</i>

84
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,028
<i>Better than I</i>

85
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,745
<i>You've got my mother's eyes</i>

86
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,751
<i>And you've got my father's hands</i>

87
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:46,108
<i>And Mama can't teach you
Things you can only learn from a man</i>

88
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,785
<i>Our hearts beat in sync so</i>

89
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,785
<i>I'm gonna be off beat</i>

90
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,628
<i>Until the day you come back to me</i>

91
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,786
<i>In the meantime</i>

92
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,944
<i>I'll be wishing on stars</i>

93
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:07,111
<i>Praying for change</i>

94
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,781
<i>And mending my heart</i>

95
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,626
<i>In the meantime</i>

96
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,780
<i>I'll cry myself awake</i>

97
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,780
<i>'Cause there's no testament</i>

98
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,784
<i>Without a test of faith</i>

99
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,782
<i>Faith</i>

100
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,590
<i>Faith</i>

101
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,300
<i>I look in your eyes</i>

102
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,300
<i>And I see myself</i>

103
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,141
<i>But you're so much better</i>

104
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,142
<i>Be someone else</i>

105
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,505
<i>'Cause I let you down</i>

106
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,347
<i>It's time you get up</i>

107
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,141
<i>And fight for yourself</i>

108
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,185
<i>'Cause I messed things up</i>

109
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:03,346
<i>You've got my attitude and
You've got your daddy's blues</i>

110
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:08,344
<i>I want you to see
Love can be faithful and true</i>

111
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,660
<i>Our hearts beat in sync so</i>

112
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,501
<i>I'm gonna be off beat</i>

113
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,862
<i>And hope someday</i>

114
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,707
<i>Is sooner than we think</i>

115
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:23,990
<i>In the meantime</i>

116
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,985
<i>We'll be wishing on stars</i>

117
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,861
<i>Praying for change</i>

118
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,706
<i>And mending my heart</i>

119
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:36,229
<i>In the meantime</i>

120
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,387
<i>Praying for change
And mending my heart</i>

121
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:46,706
<i>Not together, yet never apart</i>

122
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,227
<i>Leave the light on for me</i>

123
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:53,384
<i>Promise, baby, I'll be</i>

124
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:01,226
<i>Hush, little baby,
don't say a thing</i>

125
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,748
<i>Distance will never come between...</i>

126
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,427
<i>us.</i>

127
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,226
<i>Oh...</i>

128
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,464
<i>Every time I look at my
mom, I see her dilemma.</i>

129
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,747
<i>I'm the one thing standing
between her and being a winner.</i>

130
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:42,424
Sometimes I feel like
a motherless child.

131
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,021
Yo.

132
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,110
I feel you.

133
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:51,624
When a mother bestows
a name on a child...

134
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:56,021
it reveals her hope.
Mine named me Isaiah.

135
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,423
Like the prophet.

136
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:02,624
Sometimes I feel like
a motherless child.

137
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:12,586
<i>Sometimes I feel like
a motherless child</i>

138
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:19,586
<i>Sometimes I feel like
a motherless child</i>

139
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:26,826
<i>Right now I feel like
a motherless child</i>

140
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,664
<i>A long way...</i>

141
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:33,943
<i>from my home</i>

142
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,104
<i>My holidays are hollow days</i>

143
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:44,664
<i>With memories of my mama's face</i>

144
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:50,189
<i>I can see her now,
looking at me She smiles</i>

145
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:55,026
<i>But sometimes I feel
like a motherless child</i>

146
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,746
<i>Motherless child</i>

147
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:02,024
<i>Mama said she'd never leave</i>

148
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,701
<i>Motherless child</i>

149
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:10,025
<i>That she'd always be there for me</i>

150
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,547
<i>Motherless child</i>

151
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:16,184
<i>Where are you now?</i>

152
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,945
<i>Motherless child</i>

153
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,541
<i>Hush, little baby</i>

154
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,704
<i>A long way...</i>

155
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:33,711
<i>from my home</i>

156
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,063
Open your eyes.

157
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,461
Damn.

158
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:47,023
<i>You have reached the Cobbs
residence. We're not in now...</i>

159
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,702
<i>but please leave us a message.
And have a blessed...</i>

160
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:57,986
What you looking at?

161
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,420
Punk.

162
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,990
- You know how to get to Harlem?
- No?

163
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,506
My man...

164
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,824
I don't have money. I'm sorry.

165
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,824
You know the way to Harlem?

166
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,821
That Way?

167
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,464
Excuse me... where's the phone?

168
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,351
The phone is for guests only.
Are you a guest?

169
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:05,271
We're checking out.
Here, use this one.

170
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,790
Excuse me one second.

171
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:13,624
Hey, hon. I'm still in New York.

172
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,464
The conference just broke up.

173
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,949
I'll be home tonight.

174
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,623
No, don't worry.

175
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,462
No, of course.

176
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,828
I told you, I'm in New York.

177
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,746
Justin, your wallet!

178
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,664
- Security!
- Give me the wallet!

179
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,549
- No, wait.
- Is there a problem?

180
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,983
What you in here for?

181
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,070
I'm talking to you, youngsta.

182
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,344
What they got you for?

183
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,421
Robbery.

184
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,344
A bank or a store?

185
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,185
A wallet.

186
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,831
A wallet?

187
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:09,664
Did your mama forget to
give you your lunch money?

188
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,182
Leave my mama out of it.

189
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,627
I'm just saying...

190
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:23,020
snatching wallets is weak.

191
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,545
For punks.

192
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:29,261
Unless you're saying
your mama raised a punk.

193
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:33,463
Know what happened to the last
fool who talked about my mama?

194
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,871
Tell me about it.

195
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,879
I stole his wallet.

196
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,145
Langston Cobbs.

197
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,911
Langston?

198
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,151
Like the poet?

199
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,101
You know it.

200
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,425
Reverend, I believe this is the
young man you were looking for.

201
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,910
You've made a mistake.

202
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:25,024
I was told to expect my grandson...

203
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:28,742
not some pickpocket, so
anxious to transgress that...

204
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,864
rather than wait for his
grandparents as instructed...

205
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,100
he'd run off and violate
the first law he could.

206
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,919
I ain't no damn pickpocket.

207
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,591
I wasn't lifting the guy's
wallet, I was giving it back.

208
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:43,629
This kid jacked my backpack
and took all my money.

209
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,463
I was trying to call you.

210
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:50,706
No one pressed charges. So, we're
releasing him into your custody.

211
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,622
Welcome to New York, young man.

212
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:02,144
Apparently I'm your grandfather.

213
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:20,987
Where are we?

214
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,310
125th Street.

215
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,391
The main street of Harlem.

216
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,507
Your namesake, Langston Hughes...

217
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:35,745
once said he would rather
be a lamppost in Harlem...

218
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,982
than the governor of Georgia.

219
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,511
What are you doing?

220
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,184
- Hey, Rev.
- Maria.

221
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,185
Are you being good?

222
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:00,861
I guess.

223
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,624
Merry Christmas, babe.

224
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,862
- My grandson.
- Nice to meet you.

225
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,546
Maria! Come on,
let's do it. Come on.

226
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,782
You're in the middle of the street.

227
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:15,705
I'm saying hi to the Rev.
You're embarrassing.

228
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:18,182
Would you rather get
hit or be embarrassed?

229
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,390
Oh, Lord.

230
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,583
Look at you!

231
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:56,510
What a terrible way to start
your visit. Oh, you poor thing.

232
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:02,430
Fortunately, Officer Mac is a
good friend of the church.

233
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,830
It never hurts to have a friend

234
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,749
on the force in case of these...

235
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,751
misunderstandings.

236
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:14,264
We say grace before
we eat in this house.

237
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,751
Let us pray.

238
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,790
Lord, bless this food to our
use and us to Thy service.

239
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:27,629
And make us ever mindful of the
needs of others for Christ's sake.

240
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:33,946
Lord Jesus, today we are mindful
of the needs of this youth...

241
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:38,943
our grandson, whom Thou, in Thy
infinite wisdom, has sent to us.

242
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:42,548
And be he troubled and
in need of guidance...

243
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:46,785
or simply a belt to hold his
loose-fitting pants up...

244
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,146
allow us the fortitude and
patience to set him straight.

245
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,622
For Thou art ever bountiful.

246
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,145
Father God...

247
00:19:56,680 --> 00:20:00,387
lead this boy not into temptation,
but deliver him from evil.

248
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,479
And allow him to walk in Thy steps

249
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,311
down the path of righteousness...

250
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,066
and with Your help, obedience.

251
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,399
For Thine is the
kingdom and the power

252
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,151
and the glory, forever and ever.

253
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,981
Amen.

254
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,824
Oh, so...

255
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,505
Langston...

256
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,719
to what, besides heavenly grace,

257
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:26,346
do we owe the pleasure
of this visit?

258
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,342
She's working over Christmas.

259
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:35,342
Where is she working these days?

260
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,868
She tends bar Monday through Thursday,
and does checkout weekends.

261
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:44,785
She used to work for the
city, but they laid her off.

262
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:48,025
Does she have anyone to help her...

263
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,025
or are you the man of the house?

264
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,862
You guys don't know a
thing about us, do you?

265
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,465
No fault of ours.

266
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,703
Then whose fault is it?

267
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,031
May I be excused?

268
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,860
Clear your plate.

269
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,905
Just let him be.

270
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,584
What do you find so amusing?

271
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:02,584
This place, it's like
a museum up here.

272
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,750
A black people museum.

273
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,422
I like to remember where
we've come from...

274
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:14,104
and what it's taken to
get us where we are.

275
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:39,464
Read the engraving...

276
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,700
in here.

277
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,302
"To C.C. from M.L.K."

278
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,826
Yes.

279
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,668
- That's Martin Luther King.
- Yes.

280
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:59,826
My father, your
great-grandfather...

281
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,822
was in King's inner circle.

282
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,824
Look here.

283
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,982
He marched with him in Selma...

284
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,151
Birmingham...

285
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,426
and Memphis. I was
with him every time.

286
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,661
That's me there.

287
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,502
The year that King died...

288
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:26,028
he asked a few of us children...

289
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,663
to come speak at his
church in Atlanta.

290
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,024
I was the youngest.

291
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:38,504
Dr. King felt I spoke so
eloquently, he sent me this watch.

292
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:51,024
This will be yours someday.

293
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,519
<i>I know this is...</i>

294
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,463
a big adjustment for you.

295
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:01,279
For all of us. But I
want you to know that

296
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,542
we're very happy to have you here.

297
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:08,067
This is a girl's room,
so I hope you don't mind.

298
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,226
What went down with
you guys and my mom?

299
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,904
Why don't you talk?

300
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,064
She ran away.

301
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:23,303
For a long time, we thought
she'd come back, but...

302
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,742
she couldn't forgive us.

303
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,821
Why?

304
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,910
What'd you do to her?

305
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:35,987
I think you'll need pajamas, right?
Let's see what we have.

306
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,582
These should do for tonight.

307
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,399
If you leave your clothes out,

308
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,583
I'll wash them. I'm sorry
your bag was stolen.

309
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,111
Good night.

310
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,679
<i>The number you dialed
is not in service.</i>

311
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:05,351
<i>Please check the
number and dial again.</i>

312
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:16,319
<i>Hey, it's Naima.
Leave me a message.</i>

313
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:22,188
Mom, it's me. I'm in
New York with them.

314
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:27,185
I tried the house and the phone
was cut off. What's going on?

315
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,879
When are you coming to get me?

316
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,869
Please don't leave me
with these people.

317
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,864
We're in this together.

318
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:39,864
I'll find a way to help
you out with everything.

319
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,465
I love you.

320
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,551
Call me.

321
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,943
What are you doing in here?

322
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,265
Trying to call my mom.

323
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,943
But our phone was cut off.

324
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:49,421
Want to know what's going on?

325
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,862
We're about to lose our home.

326
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,341
They're going to put
us out on the street.

327
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,468
You got this tight crib,
and all this stuff...

328
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,950
and she's struggling.

329
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,464
Why can't you help her?

330
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,950
What kind of parents are you?

331
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:14,782
We're the broken-hearted kind.

332
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,701
<i>Silent night</i>

333
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:26,145
<i>Holy night</i>

334
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:31,984
<i>All is calm</i>

335
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:37,588
Pregnant. Practically homeless.

336
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:42,151
What some would call
a ghetto statistic.

337
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,342
I didn't want that for your mother.

338
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,670
Give this to them.

339
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,501
<i>Sleep in...</i>

340
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:06,263
<i>heavenly peace</i>

341
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:14,022
<i>Sleep in...</i>

342
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:18,868
<i>heavenly peace</i>

343
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,951
Thank you.

344
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:04,220
<i>Silent night</i>

345
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:08,060
<i>Holy night</i>

346
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:12,071
<i>Sleeping in...</i>

<i>Sleeping in...</i>

00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,263
<i>the streets</i>

350
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:25,185
<i>I ain't try'na be philosophical
But it's not logical</i>

351
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:27,422
<i>While some folks freezin'
Others chillin' like it's tropical</i>

352
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:32,427
<i>The indifference is mad crazy
Like poverty's contagious</i>

353
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:35,260
<i>My hands are dirty,

<i>They say this is your punishment
For such poor judgment</i>

356
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,623
<i>You must have lost your mind</i>

357
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:51,545
<i>How you gonna feed it
When you're barely eating</i>

358
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:55,466
<i>Get ready for the welfare line</i>

359
00:30:55,680 --> 00:31:00,468
<i>I ain't try'na hear it
You made the bed, lay in it</i>

360
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:03,704
<i>But I'm way too strong for
you to break my spirit</i>

361
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:07,382
<i>Is it me? Am I the cause
of all my mother's misery?</i>

362
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:10,464
<i>This cloud of secrecy
on my paternity</i>

363
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,471
<i>Did my very birth destroy
my whole family?</i>

364
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:18,827
<i>I'm just a sinner I know who I am</i>

365
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,983
<i>Just a beginner</i>

366
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,666
<i>I'm not yet a man</i>

367
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:28,510
<i>Send me a signal
I'll follow your light</i>

368
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,663
<i>Just help me through...</i>

369
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:33,665
<i>this silent night</i>

370
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:38,666
<i>Hush, Child, it'll be all right</i>

371
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,028
<i>I'll get you through...</i>

372
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:44,344
<i>this silent night</i>

373
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:48,866
<i>Hush, Child, it'll be all right</i>

374
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:51,660
<i>I'll get you through...</i>

375
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,943
<i>this silent night</i>

376
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,183
<i>This ain't living</i>

377
00:31:56,600 --> 00:32:01,342
<i>I got a mouth to feed
But I can't make these ends meet</i>

378
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:06,183
<i>Got an eviction notice
But my Lord don't hear my prayers</i>

379
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:09,191
<i>I never been this way</i>

380
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,021
<i>The silence is too loud for me</i>

381
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:14,542
<i>Life just ain't fair</i>

382
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:17,227
<i>- Is anyone out there?
- Does anyone care?</i>

383
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,701
<i>- Is anyone listening?
- Is anyone there?</i>

384
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,386
<i>Just let me know
I'm part of your plan</i>

385
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:25,544
<i>That you're watching
over and know who I am</i>

386
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:29,542
<i>From where we are now</i>

387
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,231
<i>Where we are</i>

388
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,749
<i>How do we find our way?</i>

389
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:39,748
<i>Alone in the darkness...</i>

390
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,507
<i>with no place to stay</i>

391
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:50,226
<i>Hush, Child, it'll be all right</i>

392
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:54,426
<i>I'll get you through
this silent night</i>

393
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,424
<i>Silent night</i>

394
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:00,426
<i>Hush, Child, it'll be all right</i>

395
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:04,745
<i>I'll get you through
this silent night</i>

396
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,183
<i>You'll get through the night</i>

397
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,590
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

398
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:19,264
<i>Sleep...</i>

399
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:23,107
<i>in heavenly peace</i>

400
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,469
<i>Sleep in heavenly...</i>

401
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:08,301
Langston, is that you?
Merry Christmas Eve.

402
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:11,981
You slept late.
You going somewhere?

403
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:14,143
Just for a walk,
if that's all right.

404
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:18,867
Well, this is New York, so
walk like you have a purpose.

405
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:22,504
You can pick up some things
from the store for me.

406
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:24,105
Wait right there.

407
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,947
- You okay, sweetie?
- Yeah, thank you.

408
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,944
Your day could've been
a whole lot worse.

409
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:50,423
- You're not from around here, clearly.
- I'm from Baltimore.

410
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:53,599
Well, watch where you're going if
you want to make it to Christmas.

411
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,543
These cabbies don't play.

412
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:57,305
Yeah, I can see that.

413
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:00,021
- Merry Christmas.
- Thank you. You, too.

414
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:04,706
Gold, silver! Whatever you need,
baby, we got it right here.

415
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:07,387
Yes, sir. All right.

416
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,384
You got what I need, brother.

417
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,304
He took care of you, right?

418
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,907
Step into my office. Come see me.

419
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:23,225
You need a two piece? What do
you need, a two or three piece?

420
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:41,981
Can I help you find
something, young man?

421
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,399
Christmas present for your mother?

422
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,741
Got some lovely items,
very affordable.

423
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,501
That's pretty.

424
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:54,500
Out of your price range.

425
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,271
You buy stuff, too, right?

426
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,582
Just don't bring me
no funky Adidas.

427
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:13,422
That's a lovely watch.

428
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:16,944
Very rare. Very valuable.

429
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:22,309
How much can I get for it?
It's got to be worth, what?

430
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,631
Five grand?

431
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,703
Oh, it's worth a great deal.

432
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:29,462
More to its owner than anyone.

433
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:36,543
This watch belongs to Reverend Cornell
Cobbs. It's his prized possession.

434
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,790
See right here?

435
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,384
"To C.C. from M.L.K."?

436
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:44,145
You know who that is?

437
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:49,141
Yes, sir. Martin Luther King.

438
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:52,519
So why don't you tell me how
Reverend Cobbs's prized possession

439
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:54,748
got in your jeans pocket?

440
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,230
He's my grandfather.

441
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,343
He gave it to me.

442
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,822
Reverend Cobbs is your grandfather.

443
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,185
You're Naima's boy.

444
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,503
Well, you listen to me, son.

445
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,581
I know your father.

446
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:22,319
And your grandfather.
And my guess is

447
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,620
Reverend Cobbs would rather...

448
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,828
be buried with this
watch clenched in

449
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,942
his cold, dead fist
than give it to you.

450
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:32,710
But if by some miracle he
ever did pass it on...

451
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:35,865
you guard it with your
life, you understand?

452
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:38,866
You pass it on to your children.

453
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,941
You don't hock it
like some crackhead.

454
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:46,021
Get out of here before
I tell him you was here.

455
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:47,861
Get...

456
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,541
out.

457
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,999
Whatever you need,
come see your boy!

458
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,546
Your boyfriend left you?
Pawn the stuff he bought you.

459
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,711
Lunch money.

460
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,479
If lifting wallets is for chumps,

461
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:11,060
what do you call this?
The big time?

462
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:14,585
This gig is an opportunity,
you play it right.

463
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:17,585
What was you doing in
there, buying or selling?

464
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,101
Just looking.

465
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:22,429
You need something? I got more than
you could ever get in a store.

466
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,902
No, I'm good. Thank you.

467
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:27,507
Anything you can
think of, I got it.

468
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:29,265
I said, I'm straight.

469
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,741
If you change your mind,
I'll be right here.

470
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,425
Yeah, whatever.

471
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:44,346
It's about time. Your grandmother's
been waiting for you.

472
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:54,705
Is it ready?

473
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,031
Tastes good to me.

474
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:06,185
Okay. You put that there
and pour it into the crust.

475
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,384
Mrs. Cobbs?

476
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:21,542
I don't really know
what to call you.

477
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:26,064
Oh, well...

478
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,702
you could try Grandma.

479
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:35,383
"Grandma" feels weird.

480
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,999
Yes, yes. To me, too.

481
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:46,221
Maybe we can take our time
with it. Let it grow on us?

482
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,221
Okay.

483
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:56,639
My mom ran away because
she got pregnant, right?

484
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,265
That's why she and
the Rev don't speak?

485
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,341
Because of me?

486
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,742
No, baby, not because of you.

487
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:16,319
Your dad was kind of a rascal,

488
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:19,344
pretending to be a gangster,
pants hanging below his butt.

489
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:24,024
He had it rough.

490
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:27,624
When he was with us, he'd
show us his sweet side.

491
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:30,181
The Reverend thought
the devil had his name.

492
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:38,625
Your grandfather is very proud,
in case you hadn't noticed.

493
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:42,279
Being a prominent minister, he
was more than just embarrassed

494
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:44,144
that his daughter was with child.

495
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,789
<i>She was only fifteen.</i>

496
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,985
<i>He wanted to kill the boy.</i>

497
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:55,461
<i>Threatened to tear him
apart with his bare hands.</i>

498
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:01,302
<i>He kind of put Naima
under house arrest.</i>

499
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:03,742
<i>He wouldn't let him
anywhere near her.</i>

500
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,505
But she must have loved him...

501
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:10,301
<i>because one day, we woke
up and she was gone.</i>

502
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:16,199
But my dad left before I was two.

503
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:18,189
My mom never mentions him or you.

504
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,262
Mistakes were made
on everyone's part.

505
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,990
What mistakes? Tell me.

506
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:25,639
All you need to know is that

507
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:27,583
your grandfather
loved your mother...

508
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:28,999
still does, with all his heart.

509
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,943
Anything he did, he did for love.

510
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:46,871
She was our baby.

511
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:54,469
The Lord's greatest gift must be
to live a life without regrets.

512
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,862
But we're so human.

513
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:32,231
<i>I'm not perfect</i>

514
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:37,061
<i>But He loves me anyway</i>

515
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:40,903
<i>Wasn't an angel</i>

516
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:45,825
<i>In my younger days</i>

517
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:49,901
<i>We all have done things</i>

518
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:54,106
<i>That's between us and God</i>

519
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:58,266
<i>There's no better comfort</i>

520
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:03,104
<i>Than being in His arms</i>

521
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:07,426
<i>He loves me...</i>

522
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,784
<i>Still</i>

523
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:14,783
<i>I'm not perfect</i>

524
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:19,307
<i>But he loves me anyway</i>

525
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:23,625
<i>This loneliness fills</i>

526
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,547
<i>Every inch of open space</i>

527
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:31,467
<i>But his grace and mercy</i>

528
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:35,782
<i>Give me strength when I am weak</i>

529
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:39,622
<i>And carries me when</i>

530
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:45,463
<i>I can't stand on my own feet</i>

531
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:49,666
<i>He loves me...</i>

532
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:51,627
<i>Still</i>

533
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:57,826
<i>So glad he loves me...</i>

534
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:00,505
<i>Still</i>

535
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:04,982
<i>And when I'm down</i>

536
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:09,346
<i>He lifts me up</i>

537
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:13,507
<i>He sees beyond</i>

538
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:16,831
<i>What I've become</i>

539
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:21,503
<i>Lord, lift me up</i>

540
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:25,708
<i>I feel so down</i>

541
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:29,705
<i>Yet he loves...</i>

542
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:33,706
<i>me still</i>

543
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:39,866
<i>So glad He loves me...</i>

544
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:42,464
<i>Still</i>

545
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:02,463
How do you keep having faith...

546
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:05,982
when so much bad has happened?

547
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:10,906
Proof of God's grace is
all around you, Langston.

548
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:12,870
You just have to open your eyes.

549
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:25,911
Cobbs residence.

550
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:28,063
I want to speak to my son.

551
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:36,741
Naima?

552
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:40,947
Put my son on the phone, please.

553
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:45,101
Or I'll hang up.

554
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:46,941
Hold on.

555
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:57,940
It's for you.

556
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,261
Mama?

557
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:07,110
I tried calling you.

558
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:08,950
Are you okay?

559
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:11,701
I'm fine. I miss you.

560
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:14,944
I miss you, too.
When are you coming?

561
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:18,551
How are your grandparents?

562
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:20,471
Mom, when are you coming?

563
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:24,227
<i>- I'll send for you as soon as I can.
- Send for me?</i>

564
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:25,541
We have no place to stay.

565
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:28,629
Don't leave me here.

566
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:31,550
I can get us the money.

567
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:34,141
<i>- Not from them. I won't take it.
- Mom, listen.</i>

568
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:37,065
<i>- I have a plan.
- What kind of plan?</i>

569
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:41,664
What kind of plan, Langston?
Don't do anything stupid.

570
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:43,823
We'll stay here till I work it out.

571
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,582
I can't do that.
You don't understand.

572
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:49,664
Oh, I understand.

573
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:52,821
You'd rather leave me
here than forgive them.

574
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:55,910
Langston...

575
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:10,023
I'm on my way to church.

576
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:14,504
I'll see you both there later.

577
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:18,022
What? Church?

578
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:19,546
Tonight?

579
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:21,625
You trippin'.

580
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:26,784
What did you say?

581
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:31,548
The Reverend's putting on his
Christmas show... "Black Nativity".

582
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:34,704
Well, count me out.
I don't do church.

583
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:41,865
"Choose for yourselves...
this day..."

584
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:45,905
"...which God you will serve."

585
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:51,227
"But as for me... and my house..."

586
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:58,065
"But as for me... and my house..."

587
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:01,584
"...we will serve the Lord."

588
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:06,660
Whatever.

589
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:13,741
I'm waiting.

590
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:18,504
Do you have something of mine?

591
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:24,505
Do you have something
that belongs to me?

592
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:30,591
Were you going to give it back?

593
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:42,942
Borrowing it. I see.

594
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:52,304
I'll see you in church.

595
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:54,781
Aretha.

596
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:58,781
Will you make sure he has
something decent to wear?

597
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:01,546
Of course, of course. Go, go, go.

598
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:03,551
I'll see you there!

599
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:13,146
You'll just have to open one of
your Christmas presents early.

600
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:19,665
Merry Christmas.

601
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:40,664
Langston, I know you
have a lot on your mind.

602
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:44,427
And maybe the last thing you want
to do is hear somebody preaching.

603
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:49,823
But this is a very important
night for your grandfather.

604
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:54,187
I know it would mean a lot
to him for you to be there.

605
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:08,785
I got this, Ma.

606
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:17,428
- $100 Knicks win the championship.
- I ain't rollin'.

607
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:19,110
- Merry Christmas.
- See you tomorrow.

608
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:24,701
Yo!

609
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:28,630
Lunch Money.

610
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:31,986
Last-minute Christmas
shopping? You're late.

611
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:35,624
What you said, about buying
more than what's in the store?

612
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:37,311
All it takes is money.

613
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:40,231
What if I needed a gun?

614
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:46,588
Meet me here tonight at ten.

615
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:48,901
A'ight.

616
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:00,427
There you are. Where were you?

617
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:02,199
I was looking all over for you.

618
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:03,426
We don't want to be late.

619
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:05,903
I was just taking a walk.

620
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:07,500
A walk?

621
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:10,799
Well, since you feel like
stretching your legs,

622
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:13,346
let's walk to church.
It's not that far.

623
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:21,267
Grandma, what happened to my
father? Is he dead or alive?

624
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,944
Somewhere in between, I expect

625
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,864
The guy at the pawnshop
said he knew him.

626
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:32,105
Pawnshop? What on earth
were you doing in there?

627
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:35,025
I was getting a present for my mom.

628
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:38,469
I told the guy I was your grandson
and he said he knew my father.

629
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:41,783
A lot of shady people
hang around pawnshops...

630
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:45,024
that one in particular.
You stay away from there.

631
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:46,551
You can't tell me what to do.

632
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:51,465
Listen to me. You're my
grandson and I love you.

633
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:54,067
The Reverend and I would
do anything for you.

634
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:57,065
And your mother.
All she has to do is ask.

635
00:51:57,200 --> 00:52:00,304
She won't ask. You know she won't.

636
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:05,461
It's fine. We'll manage.

637
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:17,980
This is it.

638
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:20,222
This is your granddad's church.

639
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:26,070
Let's get inside. We're late.

640
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:30,267
Merry Christmas, everyone.

641
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:41,025
Here, sweetheart, take this.

642
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,421
<i>Just can't stop praisin' His name</i>

643
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:50,784
<i>And I just can't stop
praisin' His name</i>

644
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,421
<i>His name
His name</i>

645
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:55,464
<i>His name</i>

646
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:57,111
<i>Name</i>

647
00:52:57,360 --> 00:52:59,110
<i>Jesus</i>

648
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:01,462
<i>El Shaddai
Immanuel</i>

649
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:04,622
<i>Prince of peace
Yeshua</i>

650
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:07,462
<i>Adonai
Lion of Judah</i>

651
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:09,519
You sit here so you
can see the show

652
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:11,224
and I'll come get you after.

653
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:15,987
<i>And I just can't
stop praisin' His name</i>

654
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:18,462
<i>His name
His name</i>

655
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:20,145
<i>His name</i>

656
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:21,621
<i>Name</i>

657
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:23,061
Redeemer!

658
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:24,461
Deliverer!

659
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:25,906
Savior!

660
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:28,142
Only begotten son!

661
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:29,825
Jehovah!

662
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:32,984
The Great I Am! The King of Kings!

663
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:34,665
The Son of Man!

664
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:38,586
<i>I can't stop praisin'
His name I just can't stop...</i>

665
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:40,311
<i>praisin' His name</i>

666
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:42,665
<i>His name</i>

667
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:44,585
Jesus.

668
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:46,345
Jesus.

669
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:50,187
Welcome! Welcome, all!

670
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:52,662
Excuse me, can we sit here?

671
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:55,822
Welcome, Catholic.
Welcome, Protestant.

672
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,909
Sorry, this seat's taken.

673
00:53:58,080 --> 00:53:59,830
- Let's go.
- Don't be like that.

674
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:04,025
Welcome Church of God, Church
of God in Christ, Pentecostal!

675
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:08,869
Whoever you are, welcome to the
Holy Resurrection Baptist Church!

676
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:10,261
Hey, guys.

677
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:12,705
Take your seats.

678
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:16,866
We have very important
business to attend to.

679
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:22,831
I said, we have very important
business to attend to.

680
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:26,544
We are here tonight...

681
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:29,545
on very important business.

682
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:32,621
Because we are here...

683
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:34,942
to praise the Lord.

684
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:38,384
How do we praise the Lord?

685
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:40,304
Hallelujah!

686
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:42,439
I wish you could see
yourselves from here,

687
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:45,384
'cause you look so beautiful
praisin' the Lord.

688
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:49,385
We are here to praise
the Lord because...

689
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:53,540
today He sent His only son.

690
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:57,745
Today the Lord is come!

691
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:00,391
Good people...

692
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:04,224
let me tell the story.

693
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:08,424
Let me spread the gospel.

694
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,262
Yes, Reverend Cobbs, yes!

695
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:37,263
<i>Jesus, You're worthy
of the highest praise</i>

696
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:45,020
According to the word of God...

697
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:47,782
according to my brother Luke...

698
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:53,023
it is said that just before the
beginning of the common age...

699
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:57,466
that all were called
by Caesar Augustus...

700
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:00,227
that is, the leader...

701
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:04,463
and this leader said
we, the state...

702
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:07,781
we have no money.

703
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:10,825
Therefore...

704
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:15,300
you must be taxed.

705
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:17,421
Not me.

706
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:24,230
We can't run from the tax man!

707
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:30,581
I'm running.

708
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:33,904
But I'm still standing still.
He's on my back.

709
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:39,985
I get my help from
my beautiful wife.

710
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:43,479
My lovely wife, who
has protected me,

711
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:46,584
helped me and guided me through
troubles and problems.

712
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:50,188
She takes care of
me in so many ways.

713
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:51,581
I am blessed.

714
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:56,866
And all went to be taxed,
each to his own city.

715
00:56:57,080 --> 00:57:00,502
And Joseph went up from Galilee...

716
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:04,865
out of the city of
Nazareth, into Judea...

717
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:08,184
unto the city of David...

718
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:11,182
which is called...

719
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:13,190
Bethlehem!

720
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:15,225
What's it called?

721
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:17,110
Bethlehem!

722
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:20,386
So Joseph came forth...

723
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:22,145
out of Bethlehem.

724
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:30,227
And he brought his wife, Mary.

725
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:34,542
Mary was just a teenage girl...

726
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:38,144
but she was big with child.

727
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:41,143
She was a teenager!

728
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:42,905
And she was great...

729
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:46,231
great with child.

730
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:50,585
And her time was coming near.

731
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:56,679
Help me praise the
Lord this evening

732
00:57:56,680 --> 00:57:59,511
all the way into Christmas morning.

733
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:04,109
Stay with me now as we
go on this journey...

734
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:09,506
because we are going to a
place where Christ was born.

735
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,750
Where are we going?

736
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:19,583
<i>Bethlehem</i>

737
00:58:24,680 --> 00:58:26,020
Bethlehem.

738
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:31,469
The place where Christ was born.

739
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:33,465
Bethlehem.

740
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:38,104
The special city where
Joseph brought Mary...

741
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:41,623
to bring the Savior of the world.

742
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:47,464
<i>Oh, Bethlehem</i>

743
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:54,302
<i>Oh, Bethlehem</i>

744
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:04,380
Help!

745
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:07,983
Hey, hey! My girl, she's in labor!
A little help, please.

746
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:10,223
- Right now?
- Yes, right now.

747
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:13,311
Are you all right?

748
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:14,991
We got it.

749
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:17,063
We have to find somewhere to go.

750
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:25,189
<i>It was difficult times then.
They couldn't find anyplace...</i>

751
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:26,661
to take them in.

752
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:29,665
They couldn't even
find a place to stay!

753
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:32,344
There was no Holiday Inn!

754
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:36,870
No Hampton Inn,
no Ramada, no Motel Six!

755
00:59:38,560 --> 00:59:42,267
<i>No room in all the great
city of Bethlehem.</i>

756
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:45,705
<i>No room for Mary anywhere.</i>

757
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:48,705
<i>The night is late, the air is cold.</i>

758
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:50,784
<i>And the doors are locked.</i>

759
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:54,181
<i>- Is anyone out there?
- Does anyone care?</i>

760
00:59:54,360 --> 00:59:57,384
<i>- Is anyone listening?
- Is anyone there?</i>

761
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:06,399
This girl's about to give birth!

762
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:08,309
We got no place to go! I need help.

763
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:09,951
Lunch Money.

764
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:11,701
Is that you?

765
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:13,391
Langston!

766
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:19,064
He's going to help us.

767
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:21,223
<i>Sleep in...</i>

768
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:25,226
<i>heavenly peace.</i>

769
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:27,904
Just come in here.

770
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:32,224
Just relax. Just relax.

771
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:39,959
Lay down here.

772
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:41,425
Please.

773
01:00:49,560 --> 01:00:50,991
Joseph!

774
01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:04,671
Fear not.

775
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:08,946
For behold, I bring you good
tidings of great joy...

776
01:01:09,160 --> 01:01:11,627
which shall be to all people.

777
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:14,944
For unto you, a Savior is born.

778
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:28,942
<i>Sweet...</i>

779
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:32,144
<i>little Jesus boy</i>

780
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:39,306
<i>They made Him born in a manger</i>

781
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:45,748
<i>Sweet little...</i>

782
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:48,471
<i>holy child</i>

783
01:01:49,560 --> 01:01:51,981
<i>They didn't know...</i>

784
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:54,462
<i>who you were</i>

785
01:01:57,880 --> 01:02:01,143
<i>They didn't know You'd come...</i>

786
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:05,665
<i>to save us, Lord</i>

787
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:09,186
<i>Take away...</i>

788
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:10,044
<i>our sins</i>

789
01:02:17,080 --> 01:02:20,821
<i>Our eyes...</i>

790
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:24,024
<i>were blind</i>

791
01:02:25,240 --> 01:02:30,346
<i>We could not see</i>

792
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:38,023
<i>And we didn't know...</i>

793
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:41,020
<i>who...</i>

794
01:02:41,240 --> 01:02:45,026
<i>You were</i>

795
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:46,870
<i>For unto us...</i>

796
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,102
<i>a child is born...</i>

797
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:52,862
<i>and His name shall be called...</i>

798
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:55,704
<i>Wonderful.</i>

799
01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:58,544
The Prince of peace.

800
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:01,065
Jesus.

801
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:05,466
And the people came to see
Him, guided by a star.

802
01:03:06,120 --> 01:03:08,541
<i>There's a star in the East...</i>

803
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:11,744
<i>on Christmas morn</i>

804
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:16,384
<i>Rise up, shepherd, and follow</i>

805
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:21,746
<i>It will lead you to the place
Where the Savior's born</i>

806
01:03:22,120 --> 01:03:27,067
<i>Rise up, shepherd, and follow</i>

807
01:03:27,480 --> 01:03:29,582

<i>Yeah, I'm the noble one

<i>Spread the word, y'all

827
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:48,187
<i>The devil's rule over
Earth now is soon gone</i>

828
01:04:48,320 --> 01:04:50,741
<i>So let the myrrh frankincense burn
Y'all been warned</i>

829
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:53,745
<i>Two thousand years ago
Now angels sound a horn</i>

01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:55,823
<i>No crown of thorns
Bow down, praise him</i>

831
01:04:55,960 --> 01:04:58,347
<i>New God flow now

832
01:04:58,560 --> 01:05:01,982
<i>The re-fo so la-ti-do

01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:03,910
<i>I'm a ghetto prophet to my people</i>

01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:07,343
<i>A ghetto priest Adonis Criminal

<i>So I seek what the Savior promised</i>

836
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:11,423
<i>Then I climb where

837
01:05:11,560 --> 01:05:14,664
<i>So I can tell it to every man,

<i>Rise up, shepherd, rise</i>

845
01:05:56,440 --> 01:05:58,907
Jesus was born...

846
01:05:59,120 --> 01:06:01,382
to heal us...

847
01:06:01,640 --> 01:06:04,903
wash us from our sins,
from our pains...

848
01:06:05,480 --> 01:06:07,742
in your time of crisis.

849
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:12,908
In your deepest despair. When the
hour is late and the rent is due.

850
01:06:13,120 --> 01:06:15,746
When you think there's
nothing more you can do...

851
01:06:15,960 --> 01:06:17,903
let your faith lead you through.

852
01:06:17,960 --> 01:06:19,903
<i>Lord, I need...</i>

853
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:31,671
<i>Fix me...</i>

854
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:34,103
<i>fix me...</i>

855
01:06:34,840 --> 01:06:36,430
<i>fix me</i>

856
01:06:36,840 --> 01:06:39,420
<i>Lord, I need...</i>

857
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:42,784
<i>You to fix me</i>

858
01:06:44,680 --> 01:06:46,111
<i>Oh, Jesus</i>

859
01:06:46,320 --> 01:06:50,948
<i>Fix me for my long white robe...</i>

860
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:53,271
Lord

861
01:06:56,840 --> 01:07:01,468
<i>And fix me for my dying bed...</i>

862
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:03,305
<i>my dying bed</i>

863
01:07:06,280 --> 01:07:08,462
<i>Lord, fix me for...</i>

864
01:07:08,680 --> 01:07:10,782
<i>my lyin'...</i>

865
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:14,986
<i>my lyin' ways</i>

866
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:20,147
<i>Lord, come on and fix me</i>

867
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:24,744
<i>In the midnight hour</i>

868
01:07:27,720 --> 01:07:29,504
<i>Fix me</i>

869
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:33,505
<i>Come on, come on</i>

870
01:07:37,240 --> 01:07:38,830
<i>Lord</i>

871
01:07:39,720 --> 01:07:41,151
Mama.

872
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:42,820
<i>That's why Christ was born.</i>

873
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:47,504
Christ was born to
turn water into wine.

874
01:07:47,720 --> 01:07:51,188
To heal the sick. Raise the dead.

875
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:56,506
To make the lion lay down with the
lamb. The mighty to be meek.

876
01:07:56,920 --> 01:08:00,024
And the meek... to rise up.

877
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:09,706
If Christ can do all that, why can't
He fix your relationship with my mom?

878
01:08:11,240 --> 01:08:13,183
That's why He came.

879
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:17,784
When you're feeling down. That's
when you need God the most.

880
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:21,706
And know that that's
why Christ was born.

881
01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:23,544
To save you.

882
01:08:27,760 --> 01:08:31,069
Jesus was born to redeem mankind.

883
01:08:32,760 --> 01:08:34,544
He gave Himself...

884
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:36,710
a ransom...

885
01:08:37,440 --> 01:08:38,905
for all.

886
01:08:40,040 --> 01:08:41,630
To forgive us our sins...

887
01:08:43,440 --> 01:08:45,224
and wash us clean.

888
01:08:46,720 --> 01:08:48,390
But you have to want
to be redeemed!

889
01:08:51,800 --> 01:08:55,746
<i>I need...</i>

890
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:03,588
<i>I need your power, Lord</i>

891
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:08,746
<i>So come on and fix me</i>

892
01:09:13,160 --> 01:09:15,262
<i>Lord, I need...</i>

893
01:09:15,480 --> 01:09:17,582
<i>Shortly arriving in Times Square.</i>

894
01:09:17,840 --> 01:09:19,942
<i>Fix me</i>

895
01:09:25,320 --> 01:09:27,422
Lunch Money, what up, man?

896
01:09:28,480 --> 01:09:31,629
I thought you got caught up in
church and wouldn't make it.

897
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:34,784
They can pray all they want.

898
01:09:35,160 --> 01:09:36,705
It ain't for me.

899
01:09:38,160 --> 01:09:42,106
Ain't no miracle, it's just money.
Who got it and who ain't.

900
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:45,191
You get what I asked for?

901
01:09:45,360 --> 01:09:48,304
Why don't you tell me
what you need it for?

902
01:09:48,840 --> 01:09:52,308
That's my business. All you
got to know is I need it.

903
01:09:52,840 --> 01:09:54,942
Now you got it or not, man?

904
01:09:56,360 --> 01:09:57,791
I got it.

905
01:09:58,360 --> 01:10:01,623
There's a lot of different
guns for different occasions.

906
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:04,621
And I'm sure cost is a factor.

907
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:09,306
You can drop between
a buck fifty up to 5 G's.

908
01:10:09,880 --> 01:10:13,143
Let's stay on the low end.
What do you recommend?

909
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:17,510
A Davis 380. It's
practical, inexpensive.

910
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:20,506
Does the trick in most situations.

911
01:10:21,480 --> 01:10:22,661
It's what I carry.

912
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:25,831
Relax, Lunch Money.

913
01:10:26,720 --> 01:10:29,061
I ain't shot nobody in a minute.

914
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:34,581
Can I see it?

915
01:10:57,440 --> 01:10:58,871
Taxi!

916
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:05,861
I'm going to Harlem.
Convent Avenue.

917
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:11,703
You ever held a gun before?

918
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:16,306
You know what'll happen
if you're caught carrying?

919
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:17,831
I won't get caught.

920
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:20,222
How many fools have
I heard say that?

921
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:26,141
You remind me of
somebody, Lunch Money.

922
01:11:28,280 --> 01:11:31,224
Another young punk
thought he was hard.

923
01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:36,985
Who's the punk now?

924
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:40,745
Open the case.

925
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:42,311
Open the case!

926
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:44,744
I got to get the key.

927
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:48,903
I'm just getting the key.

928
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:53,660
That one, there.

929
01:11:54,160 --> 01:11:55,750
Pull it out.

930
01:11:59,160 --> 01:12:00,591
What do you think it's worth?

931
01:12:00,720 --> 01:12:03,585
About the time you'll
get behind bars.

932
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:07,264
Put it on the counter. I want
what's in the register, too.

933
01:12:09,480 --> 01:12:10,581
No.

934
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:12,231
You trying to die tonight?

935
01:12:17,680 --> 01:12:19,111
Open the damn register!

936
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:23,466
"What happens to a dream deferred?"

937
01:12:26,520 --> 01:12:29,271
"Does it dry up like a
raisin in the sun?"

938
01:12:30,840 --> 01:12:33,705
"Or fester like a sore...
And then run?"

939
01:12:35,200 --> 01:12:37,621
"Does it stink like rotten meat?"

940
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:44,466
"Or crust and sugar over...
like a syrupy sweet?"

941
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:53,984
"Maybe it just sags
Like a heavy load."

942
01:12:56,040 --> 01:12:57,471
"Or does it explode?"

943
01:12:57,640 --> 01:12:58,741
I told you to shut up.

944
01:12:59,040 --> 01:13:01,142
It's a famous poem...

945
01:13:01,880 --> 01:13:04,301
by the great Langston Hughes.

946
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:09,060
- Your mother loved him.
- Don't talk about my ma...

947
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:11,661
What?

948
01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:13,706
What did you say?

949
01:13:13,880 --> 01:13:16,187
She loved him so much...

950
01:13:17,880 --> 01:13:19,664
we named our son after him.

951
01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:29,341
No.

952
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:34,865
Not you.

953
01:13:37,400 --> 01:13:39,104
You're not my father.

954
01:13:39,240 --> 01:13:41,422
That's why I asked
you to meet me here.

955
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:44,025
When I first saw you...

956
01:13:44,160 --> 01:13:47,343
there was something
about you I recognized.

957
01:13:49,240 --> 01:13:52,708
You remind me of myself,
when I was young.

958
01:13:52,920 --> 01:13:55,705
Lost. Vulnerable.

959
01:13:56,200 --> 01:13:59,622
At every fork, taking
the wrong turn.

960
01:14:00,760 --> 01:14:02,783
When we was in that cell...

961
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:05,862
officer said your name.

962
01:14:07,960 --> 01:14:11,382
No, I'm nothing like you.
I'm nothing like you!

963
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:14,624
You criminal!
You blood-sucking scumbag!

964
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:17,221
Preying on poor people
with a little cash.

965
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:19,383
And you say that here?

966
01:14:19,960 --> 01:14:22,381
Waving a gun in my face?

967
01:14:22,640 --> 01:14:25,391
About to wreck your
whole life like I did?

968
01:14:35,320 --> 01:14:37,582
You abandoned us.

969
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:40,070
I did worse than that.

970
01:14:41,160 --> 01:14:43,103
I sold my soul.

971
01:14:45,320 --> 01:14:48,185
And your grandfather gave
me an excuse to do it.

972
01:14:49,640 --> 01:14:51,105
What'd he do?

973
01:14:51,640 --> 01:14:53,583
Tell me what he did.

974
01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:58,265
You know where he's at.
Why don't you ask him?

975
01:15:03,320 --> 01:15:04,785
Let's go.

976
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:08,101
Freeze! Police! Drop the gun!

977
01:15:08,680 --> 01:15:11,704
- On your knees!
- Don't shoot! That's my son!

978
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:15,706
We were just having a heated
conversation! The gun's empty! Check it!

979
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:19,861
He's just trying to get
me to go to the church.

980
01:15:20,840 --> 01:15:23,119
He's asking me why
I left him and his mother

981
01:15:23,120 --> 01:15:25,461
when he was a kid! Don't hurt him!

982
01:15:26,040 --> 01:15:27,551
That's my son.

983
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:36,462
What were you thinking? You
should be ashamed of yourself!

984
01:15:36,720 --> 01:15:40,039
If anybody else on
my force was here,

985
01:15:40,040 --> 01:15:41,824
this would have ended
very differently.

986
01:15:43,200 --> 01:15:44,665
Officer.

987
01:15:45,360 --> 01:15:47,827
Let him do what he came here to do.

988
01:15:54,720 --> 01:15:56,345
Stop right here.

989
01:16:27,080 --> 01:16:28,341
Mama?

990
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:31,031
Oh, my God.

991
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:32,780
Oh, God.

992
01:16:36,080 --> 01:16:38,262
Are you in trouble?
Where are you taking him?

993
01:16:38,440 --> 01:16:39,919
He had an altercation
with his father.

994
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:41,306
I'm taking him to the church.

995
01:16:42,080 --> 01:16:43,545
His father?

996
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:52,861
Tyson?

997
01:16:58,680 --> 01:17:00,623
What have you done to my son?

998
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:02,311
What did you get him mixed up in?

999
01:17:02,720 --> 01:17:04,231
He asked me questions.

1000
01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:08,742
I'm trying to get them answered.

1001
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:14,827
That's it. We're going
inside the church. Come on.

1002
01:17:25,960 --> 01:17:27,585
Langston, I can't go in there.

1003
01:17:29,320 --> 01:17:30,910
Yes, you can.

1004
01:17:31,400 --> 01:17:35,346
I want you to go home
and practice love.

1005
01:17:36,160 --> 01:17:37,944
Practice love on your family.

1006
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:42,181
Practice love on your children.

1007
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,421
Love your parents.

1008
01:17:47,400 --> 01:17:49,423
Love your neighbors.

1009
01:17:50,520 --> 01:17:54,625
And pretty soon, the hardness
in your heart will melt and...

1010
01:17:54,760 --> 01:17:58,103
you will be able to love
even your enemies.

1011
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:06,469
Because love is the most
creative power in the universe.

1012
01:18:21,200 --> 01:18:22,631
Naima!

1013
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:24,630
My baby girl.

1014
01:18:26,120 --> 01:18:28,541
Reverend, I got
something to ask you.

1015
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:32,305
I got my mother and
father in front of you.

1016
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:34,744
And I want to know what happened.

1017
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:44,344
I couldn't bear it.

1018
01:18:46,720 --> 01:18:51,189
I couldn't bear to lose you, Naima.

1019
01:18:52,240 --> 01:18:53,501
I couldn't bear it.

1020
01:18:53,560 --> 01:18:54,741
What'd you do?

1021
01:18:56,240 --> 01:18:58,661
I bribed him...

1022
01:18:59,920 --> 01:19:02,500
to leave her.

1023
01:19:05,640 --> 01:19:07,504
I paid him five thousand dollars.

1024
01:19:13,240 --> 01:19:15,183
That's all I was worth to you?

1025
01:19:17,080 --> 01:19:18,599
All my life, I've
tried to figure out

1026
01:19:18,600 --> 01:19:21,021
what I did not to deserve a father.

1027
01:19:21,920 --> 01:19:23,943
And you left me for five G's?

1028
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:29,024
I was trying to take care
of you and your mother.

1029
01:19:31,120 --> 01:19:32,870
But I was a boy.

1030
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:36,863
Not a man. Or a father.

1031
01:19:38,440 --> 01:19:41,862
I got caught up with some
bad people in the streets.

1032
01:19:42,120 --> 01:19:43,904
Had some debts.

1033
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:47,143
Your grandfather gave me money...

1034
01:19:47,800 --> 01:19:49,550
and in return...

1035
01:19:50,520 --> 01:19:53,669
he made me swear to
stay out of your lives.

1036
01:19:54,960 --> 01:19:56,903
And I agreed.

1037
01:19:58,640 --> 01:20:00,902
You took my father away from me.

1038
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:02,983
I thought she'd come home.

1039
01:20:03,960 --> 01:20:05,744
That was the plan.

1040
01:20:06,120 --> 01:20:08,427
The plan was that I would...

1041
01:20:09,480 --> 01:20:11,582
show her Tyson's true colors.

1042
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:14,742
And then she would come back.

1043
01:20:16,480 --> 01:20:18,264
But she found out.

1044
01:20:19,480 --> 01:20:23,426
And the true colors that she saw...

1045
01:20:24,640 --> 01:20:26,105
were mine.

1046
01:20:29,640 --> 01:20:30,980
I hope you never know

1047
01:20:31,040 --> 01:20:34,999
what it feels like to spend
your whole life regretting...

1048
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,262
one shameful act.

1049
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:40,781
Naima?

1050
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:43,622
Naima. Please.

1051
01:20:44,160 --> 01:20:46,786
I want to say, in front of God...

1052
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,944
Naima, in front of this
whole congregation...

1053
01:20:51,520 --> 01:20:53,384
that I'm so sorry.

1054
01:20:54,200 --> 01:20:57,782
I'm so sorry for
meddling in your life.

1055
01:20:59,040 --> 01:21:00,790
Maybe you were right.

1056
01:21:02,360 --> 01:21:05,145
Maybe she was better
off without me.

1057
01:21:07,040 --> 01:21:09,620
But I wasn't better
off without you.

1058
01:21:12,360 --> 01:21:14,827
I had one shot at happiness.

1059
01:21:16,360 --> 01:21:18,144
And I messed it up.

1060
01:21:18,280 --> 01:21:19,905
Yeah, you messed it up.

1061
01:21:23,400 --> 01:21:25,662
I had your child.

1062
01:21:26,960 --> 01:21:28,425
I trusted you.

1063
01:21:32,040 --> 01:21:33,824
I trusted all of you.

1064
01:21:37,480 --> 01:21:39,742
- Langston, we're going.
- Where?

1065
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:42,662
- We have no place to go.
- I don't know.

1066
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:45,346
But wherever I'm going,
I'm taking you with me.

1067
01:21:45,480 --> 01:21:47,503
This isn't just about you!

1068
01:21:48,720 --> 01:21:52,029
This could be what I've been
waiting for my whole life.

1069
01:21:53,240 --> 01:21:54,865
Don't you see?

1070
01:21:55,840 --> 01:21:57,430
We're all here.

1071
01:21:57,600 --> 01:21:59,031
Right now.

1072
01:21:59,240 --> 01:22:00,705
In this house!

1073
01:22:02,160 --> 01:22:03,341
You and Dad.

1074
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:07,023
Grandma and Granddad, family
I didn't even know I had.

1075
01:22:07,240 --> 01:22:09,547
I didn't even know I had this!

1076
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:13,863
No. No!

1077
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:19,103
I'm not letting you take this
opportunity away from me!

1078
01:22:24,680 --> 01:22:26,066
No.

1079
01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:31,701
This is my Christmas miracle.

1080
01:22:38,520 --> 01:22:40,224
It's time to forgive, Ma.

1081
01:22:42,360 --> 01:22:44,224
It's time to be redeemed.

1082
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:46,902
And it's time to come home.

1083
01:23:12,840 --> 01:23:14,749
Praise Jesus.

1084
01:23:21,680 --> 01:23:24,260
Ten thousand times
I prayed for this miracle.

1085
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:28,786
- I love you so much.
- I love you, too.

1086
01:23:31,160 --> 01:23:32,625
I'm sorry.

1087
01:23:39,080 --> 01:23:41,467
<i>God has...</i>

1088
01:23:41,680 --> 01:23:46,627
<i>not promised me...</i>

1089
01:23:47,040 --> 01:23:49,791
<i>sunshine</i>

1090
01:23:50,040 --> 01:23:53,303
<i>That's not the way...</i>

1091
01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:57,466
<i>it's going to be</i>

1092
01:23:58,360 --> 01:24:00,622
<i>But a...</i>

1093
01:24:01,200 --> 01:24:03,826
<i>little rain...</i>

1094
01:24:05,880 --> 01:24:08,984
<i>mixed with...</i>

1095
01:24:09,120 --> 01:24:11,826
<i>God's sunshine</i>

1096
01:24:12,040 --> 01:24:16,509
<i>A little pain</i>

1097
01:24:16,880 --> 01:24:19,824
<i>Makes me appreciate...</i>

1098
01:24:20,400 --> 01:24:24,186
<i>the good times</i>

1099
01:24:24,400 --> 01:24:26,662
<i>Be...</i>

1100
01:24:30,920 --> 01:24:33,182
<i>grateful</i>

1101
01:24:34,720 --> 01:24:39,860
<i>God desires...</i>

1102
01:24:40,080 --> 01:24:42,342
<i>to feel...</i>

1103
01:24:42,560 --> 01:24:45,027
<i>your longings</i>

1104
01:24:45,920 --> 01:24:48,022
<i>Every...</i>

1105
01:24:48,600 --> 01:24:50,350
<i>pain that...</i>

1106
01:24:51,240 --> 01:24:53,342
<i>you feel</i>

1107
01:24:53,920 --> 01:24:56,864
<i>He feels them...</i>

1108
01:24:57,440 --> 01:24:59,861
<i>just like you</i>

1109
01:25:01,840 --> 01:25:03,544
<i>But He can't...</i>

1110
01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:07,546
<i>afford to let you feel...</i>

1111
01:25:08,440 --> 01:25:10,702
<i>only good</i>

1112
01:25:13,120 --> 01:25:16,064
<i>Then you can't appreciate...</i>

1113
01:25:16,280 --> 01:25:19,702
<i>the good times</i>

1114
01:25:21,960 --> 01:25:25,064

1119
01:25:38,400 --> 01:25:41,151
<i>who would love to be in your shoes</i>

1120
01:25:41,320 --> 01:25:44,424
<i>Be grateful</i>

1121

<i>be all right</i>

1144
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:17,750
Merry Christmas, Lunch Money.

1145
01:27:17,920 --> 01:27:19,431
Merry Christmas.

1146
01:27:38,760 --> 01:27:41,784
Ma, can we stay? Please?

1147
01:27:41,920 --> 01:27:44,626
- As long as your grandparents will have us.
- Stay as long as you like.

1148
01:27:44,760 --> 01:27:46,191
You can stay forever.

1149
01:27:46,440 --> 01:27:48,781
It's your home. Always.

1150
01:27:49,920 --> 01:27:51,704
<i>Always</i>

1151
01:27:54,600 --> 01:27:56,384
<i>Always</i>

1152
01:28:03,880 --> 01:28:07,826
<i>We all know sometimes
life's hates and troubles</i>

1153
01:28:08,120 --> 01:28:12,544
<i>Can make you wish you were born
In another time and space</i>

1154
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:16,541
<i>But you can bet your life
Times that and twice its double</i>

1155
01:28:17,280 --> 01:28:20,827
<i>That God knew exactly
Where He wanted you to be placed</i>

1156
01:28:21,960 --> 01:28:26,429
<i>So make sure when you say
you're in it but not of it</i>

1157
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:31,064
<i>You're not helping to make this
earth a place sometimes called Hell</i>

1158
01:28:31,720 --> 01:28:35,745
<i>Change your words into truth
And then change that truth into love</i>

1159
01:28:35,880 --> 01:28:37,559
<i>And maybe our children's
grandchildren</i>

1160
01:28:37,560 --> 01:28:39,901
<i>And their great-grandchildren
will tell</i>

1161
01:28:41,640 --> 01:28:45,950
<i>Until the rainbow burns
the stars out in the sky</i>

1162
01:28:46,320 --> 01:28:50,266
<i>Until the ocean covers
every mountain high</i>

1163
01:28:50,680 --> 01:28:54,421
<i>Until the dolphin flies
and parrots live at sea</i>

1164
01:28:55,320 --> 01:28:59,789
<i>Until we dream of life
and life becomes a dream</i>

1165
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:03,946
<i>Until the day is night and
night becomes the day</i>

1166
01:29:04,520 --> 01:29:08,625
<i>Until the trees and seas
just up and fly away</i>

1167
01:29:09,360 --> 01:29:13,624
<i>Until the day that
8 times 8 times 8 is four</i>

1168
01:29:13,840 --> 01:29:18,229
<i>Until the day that is the
day that are no more</i>

1169
01:29:18,280 --> 01:29:20,462
<i>Always</i>

1170
01:29:22,520 --> 01:29:26,784
<i>Always</i>

1171
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:28,983
<i>Always</i>

1172
01:29:29,120 --> 01:29:31,302
<i>Always</i>

1173
01:29:31,520 --> 01:29:33,384
<i>Always</i>

1174
01:29:36,040 --> 01:29:39,667
<i>Always</i>

1175
01:29:45,560 --> 01:29:49,984
<i>Always</i>

1176
01:29:50,200 --> 01:29:51,984
<i>Always</i>

1177
01:29:54,720 --> 01:29:57,187
<i>Always</i>
