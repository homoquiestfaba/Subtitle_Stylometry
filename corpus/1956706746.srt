1
00:00:26,435 --> 00:00:30,246
Hey, attaboy! Had a voyage, eh there?

2
00:00:30,296 --> 00:00:33,388
Who is my good little vibe receiver?
You are, you are.

3
00:00:33,443 --> 00:00:35,976
You're better than Otro Cinco,
that's for sure.

4
00:00:36,026 --> 00:00:41,341
All right, now: it's 4th and Long, T-dog.
We need you, baby, it's hero time. You ready?

5
00:00:41,537 --> 00:00:44,450
Give me some paw, all right or not.

6
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,654
Ready? Break!

7
00:00:47,753 --> 00:00:51,166
Down ! Set ! Listen yay !

8
00:00:51,216 --> 00:00:54,702
Listen yay! Check five, check five!

9
00:00:54,941 --> 00:00:56,779
Hut! Hut! Hike !
- [barks]

10
00:00:56,829 --> 00:00:59,634
There goes Lattimer!
Lattimer feeds back!

11
00:00:59,684 --> 00:01:03,103
He banks right, he banks left,
he fires !

12
00:01:04,757 --> 00:01:06,192
Aww...

13
00:01:08,618 --> 00:01:10,331
- Ahh...
- [barks]

14
00:01:10,599 --> 00:01:15,313
Trailer! That's... how are you gonna
explain that to Artie? Huh?

15
00:01:24,806 --> 00:01:25,847
Do you hear that?

16
00:01:26,717 --> 00:01:28,116
- What, Myka?

17
00:01:28,703 --> 00:01:32,665
Pitter-patter of rain on the Warehouse
roof. No pings, no drama...

18
00:01:33,025 --> 00:01:36,030
Ahh... best rainy day ever.

19
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,435
<i>Claudia!</i>

20
00:01:38,307 --> 00:01:40,625
And here comes the thunderstorm

21
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:48,044
How many times have I told you

22
00:01:48,094 --> 00:01:50,510
that the Warehouse is not your
personal parking garage?

23
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,696
Come on, Artie, give me a break.
I just washed this bad girl yesterday.

24
00:01:53,746 --> 00:01:57,371
Not my problem! What...
what are you doing in there?

25
00:01:57,421 --> 00:01:58,795
- Playing.
- With what?

26
00:01:58,845 --> 00:02:00,659
Toyota's end-tune system.

27
00:02:00,709 --> 00:02:03,170
- It's up-tastic.
- Ok, show me.

28
00:02:09,848 --> 00:02:12,067
Hmm. Impressive.

29
00:02:12,469 --> 00:02:14,412
- Clang, yeah...
- No damaging!

30
00:02:20,527 --> 00:02:24,588
Oh no...  I can hear Artie now: "Pete!"

31
00:02:25,072 --> 00:02:28,103
"Don't play ball in the house!
You'll put someone's eye out!"

32
00:02:28,975 --> 00:02:31,558
Or... maybe that was my Mom.

33
00:02:33,669 --> 00:02:37,725
Trailer! <i>Hey. Hey, bud!
What'd you get there?</i>

34
00:02:41,981 --> 00:02:44,451
- Where'd you get this?
- [yelps]

35
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:52,436
Man, how many things
did that football knock over.

36
00:02:55,502 --> 00:03:00,211
"Conceptual model. For display purposes
only. Do not activate".

37
00:03:02,294 --> 00:03:04,940
Ominous, but intriguing.

38
00:03:05,816 --> 00:03:08,508
We're not allowed  to play
with artifacts, so let's...

39
00:03:08,558 --> 00:03:12,671
- ...let's put this baby back where
we found it. What do you say?
- [yaffs]

40
00:03:15,812 --> 00:03:18,442
- [barks]
- It takes a steady hand...

41
00:03:18,492 --> 00:03:22,257
...to put it back where it belongs.
Bingo!

42
00:03:22,431 --> 00:03:25,346
- Where's the steal, my friend? He-he...
- [whines]

43
00:03:30,474 --> 00:03:32,518
Okay, kid. Get back to it, get back.

44
00:03:40,339 --> 00:03:42,992
Jules Verne, eat your heart out...

45
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:48,209
Damn. We should sell these things.

46
00:03:48,259 --> 00:03:50,937
Make enough money to put it
in a gym around here.

47
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,172
Okay, okay. Now that is cool.

48
00:03:59,169 --> 00:04:02,707
Ok, a little less cool. A little more [...]
what the hell d'you do.

49
00:04:02,863 --> 00:04:03,973
All right, let's go.

50
00:04:06,607 --> 00:04:12,017
Okay, um... game's over, Charlie.
Come away, come away. Let's find Artie!

51
00:04:21,126 --> 00:04:23,069
Well, it wasn't my fault,
I was with you!

52
00:04:28,949 --> 00:04:30,272
Claudia, what's happening ?!

53
00:04:30,322 --> 00:04:32,941
No idea,but apparently it's not
Claudia's fault.

54
00:04:40,188 --> 00:04:42,633
I suggest we TAKE COVER!!

55
00:04:45,129 --> 00:04:46,581
Well, this is certainly a new look.

56
00:04:46,631 --> 00:04:50,365
Steampunky, metallic, and talk
about slimming.

57
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:54,911
- Um,  Artie, what just happened ?
- I'm gonna guess an artifact has triggered.

58
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:59,040
Yea-yes, but I wonder,
who triggered it.

59
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:01,215
It wasn't me! It wasn't me, I swear!

60
00:05:01,265 --> 00:05:04,409
I begged Trailer not to fox
with that old-timey box.

61
00:05:04,459 --> 00:05:06,203
- Bad Trailer!
- [growls]

62
00:05:06,253 --> 00:05:08,631
Oh, like "what, so the dog ate
your homework in..."

63
00:05:08,681 --> 00:05:09,971
Wait a minute, what box?

64
00:05:10,021 --> 00:05:14,182
Um... t-th-he one with that steampunky
diorama inside, and... Hey!

65
00:05:14,232 --> 00:05:18,795
Artie, if that was an "old science project"
years, I give you an A++.

66
00:05:18,845 --> 00:05:21,387
Diorama? Oh...

67
00:05:21,837 --> 00:05:23,682
- You didn't...
- Didn't what, Artie?

68
00:05:23,732 --> 00:05:26,319
What did Pete not do that we all
know he did?

69
00:05:26,369 --> 00:05:30,990
This is the brainchild of Thomas Alva Edison,
Nikola Tesla  and M.C.Escher.

70
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:35,636
Welcome... to the Original Warehouse 13!

71
00:06:06,678 --> 00:06:09,174
Artie, how is this the original
Warehouse 13?

72
00:06:09,224 --> 00:06:12,427
I-i thought the original burned down
over a century ago.

73
00:06:12,477 --> 00:06:14,898
Yeah, this is what it looked like
before the fire.

74
00:06:14,948 --> 00:06:17,120
Only m...more 3D.

75
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:20,682
Transforms a third dimension?
Times have changed since you were a kid.

76
00:06:20,732 --> 00:06:23,776
Um...so does this mean we're
inside the diorama now ?

77
00:06:23,826 --> 00:06:26,745
Well, man, I'm still trying to wash the Ghoul stinky

78
00:06:26,795 --> 00:06:30,115
off my favorite T-sh from the last time
I got sucked into an artifact.

79
00:06:30,165 --> 00:06:32,816
Why are you always been sucked
into anything,  Pete.

80
00:06:32,866 --> 00:06:35,320
The Warehouse and everything in it,
present company included,

81
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:38,984
has been transformed into a massive
two-dimensional scale model.

82
00:06:40,928 --> 00:06:43,311
What? No, I know you didn't do it, Trailer.

83
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:47,223
Alright, when the Regents hired
Thomas Edison, Nikola Tesla and M.C.Esher

84
00:06:47,273 --> 00:06:49,124
to design Warehouse 13 the first time...

85
00:06:49,901 --> 00:06:51,227
...they asked for a proof-of-concept.

86
00:06:51,277 --> 00:06:53,685
- [barks]
- T-T-Trailer, I know!

87
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,021
Well, what they got

88
00:06:55,071 --> 00:06:58,494
was an elaborate mechanized diorama
showcasing their plans for the Warehouse.

89
00:06:58,544 --> 00:07:01,903
And when somebody, not Trailer,
activated that model,

90
00:07:01,953 --> 00:07:05,135
Warehouse 13 1.0 superimposed itself
on the current OS.

91
00:07:05,185 --> 00:07:07,050
God, when did I start sounding
like Fargo?

92
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,777
And if we don't reboot it back...

93
00:07:09,141 --> 00:07:12,083
... the instruction '2D' will be
the least of our problems.

94
00:07:12,133 --> 00:07:16,730
Okay. So, if we just neutralize the thing,
then... this all goes back to normal.

95
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:17,713
- Right?
- Precisely.

96
00:07:17,763 --> 00:07:19,752
But first we have to find it.

97
00:07:20,003 --> 00:07:22,565
Pete, what aisle was the model in?

98
00:07:22,615 --> 00:07:26,628
Umm... the... middle one?
Look, I don't know!

99
00:07:26,678 --> 00:07:28,698
How do they not all look the same
to you, people?

100
00:07:28,748 --> 00:07:30,597
Okay, you were with Trailer, right?

101
00:07:30,598 --> 00:07:32,310
- He can show us, which one.
- [barks]

102
00:07:33,265 --> 00:07:36,101
Alright, fine. Lina, take Trailer, find the model.

103
00:07:36,361 --> 00:07:37,758
Bring it back to my off...

104
00:07:41,867 --> 00:07:45,447
- [barks]
- Ooh, an earthquake, extra  shaky!

105
00:07:45,497 --> 00:07:48,150
The dogs have sense of seismic activity.

106
00:07:48,398 --> 00:07:51,234
You were trying to tell me something,
what's your point? Good Trailer.

107
00:07:51,284 --> 00:07:52,254
What caused it?

108
00:07:52,304 --> 00:07:54,224
- Claudia, periscope!
- Aye-aye, Captain!

109
00:07:54,726 --> 00:07:55,973
What am looking for?

110
00:07:56,023 --> 00:07:57,666
- The Anubis Shrine.
- Right!

111
00:07:57,936 --> 00:08:00,194
- What's an Anubis Shrine?
- The pyramid!

112
00:08:00,244 --> 00:08:01,756
The pyramid, do you see the pyramid?

113
00:08:01,806 --> 00:08:04,916
<i>- Hello, glowy and pointy.
- Let me see that.</i>

114
00:08:04,966 --> 00:08:08,465
Oh, oh, that's bad. That's very bad.

115
00:08:08,515 --> 00:08:12,509
What, more bad? Exactly, how much bad
does this place have?

116
00:08:12,559 --> 00:08:15,747
The first Warehouse 13 was powered
by three different energy sources.

117
00:08:15,797 --> 00:08:18,742
Hydroelectricity, wind power,
and seismic force.

118
00:08:18,792 --> 00:08:20,873
Each of which was generated
by an artifact.

119
00:08:20,923 --> 00:08:23,290
You mean, like a pyramid that
causes earthquakes?

120
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:26,215
Yes, triggering the diorama must have
brought it back online.

121
00:08:26,661 --> 00:08:29,518
- That's... going to be a problem.
- A big one.

122
00:08:29,568 --> 00:08:32,108
Those power sources were
incredibly unstable.

123
00:08:32,158 --> 00:08:34,685
That's why all three were
taken offline decades ago.

124
00:08:34,735 --> 00:08:39,237
Artie... if one's been activated,
so will the other two. And soon.

125
00:08:39,426 --> 00:08:42,296
Left unchecked, any of them
could destroy the Warehouse.

126
00:08:42,346 --> 00:08:43,601
How much, shut it down?

127
00:08:43,651 --> 00:08:46,185
Does the pyramid come with
an on-off switch?

128
00:08:46,235 --> 00:08:50,209
The Anubis Shrine harnesses the vibrations
of green Moldavite crystals

129
00:08:50,259 --> 00:08:53,322
and converts them into energy,
but in order to function properly...

130
00:08:53,372 --> 00:08:55,796
...those crystals must be
carefully balanced.

131
00:08:55,846 --> 00:08:58,600
- And if they're not...?
- More bad.

132
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:03,851
Mmm...yeah. Imagine an 11 point low on the
Richter scale, and then... multiply it by 10.

133
00:09:03,901 --> 00:09:07,177
A 110 point'o? What?!

134
00:09:07,227 --> 00:09:10,292
Leena, there's no way that you'll get
to the artifact in time.

135
00:09:10,342 --> 00:09:13,105
We must shut that parable down.

136
00:09:13,155 --> 00:09:14,623
- Do you...?
- I'm on it.

137
00:09:14,673 --> 00:09:16,794
- Take Trailer. Collective ouch for you.
- [barks]

138
00:09:17,215 --> 00:09:18,364
What? Trust me!

139
00:09:19,239 --> 00:09:23,365
- Mighty long walk  to that pyramid...
- Who said anything about walking?

140
00:09:24,514 --> 00:09:28,093
Trailer, just don't get your tongue
caught on another artifact!
- [barks]

141
00:09:53,126 --> 00:09:56,423
Wait, w-w-wait, what do you mean
"nothing works"?

142
00:09:56,473 --> 00:09:59,060
- What, even a computer?
- It looks like any technology,

143
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:02,556
hardwired to the warehouse got disconnected
when this place was transformed.

144
00:10:02,606 --> 00:10:04,234
So no. Not even.

145
00:10:04,284 --> 00:10:06,818
Damn! So no cable TV either.

146
00:10:07,059 --> 00:10:09,921
Plus, how are we supposed
to figure out a way to reverse artifact

147
00:10:09,971 --> 00:10:11,710
without the artifact database?

148
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,014
Try old-fashioned way:
Pete-manual, manual-Pete

149
00:10:15,064 --> 00:10:17,478
- About timing to got acquainted.
- I hate blind dates.

150
00:10:17,528 --> 00:10:21,787
Not a blind date, it's an arranged marriage.
Now, read! I'll check in with the others.

151
00:10:32,528 --> 00:10:34,504
Yes, Dad, we're exactly where we're
supposed to be.

152
00:10:34,554 --> 00:10:37,880
Remember, you need to balance those crystals
to prevent any more tremors, and

153
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:40,164
<i> if their alignment is out by so much as I hear...</i>

154
00:10:40,214 --> 00:10:43,046
Um, I think I can align a crystal.
I've played Bejeweled.

155
00:10:43,096 --> 00:10:45,673
Don't dawdle, keep me posted.
[...] when you're done there...

156
00:10:45,723 --> 00:10:48,566
Find the artifact, bring it to your office.
Goodbye Artie...

157
00:10:49,175 --> 00:10:52,110
Well, you heard the man. Better put
some more giddyup in our Yeah!

158
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,026
Oh, this could be dangerous. One of us
should stay out  here, just in case.

159
00:10:55,076 --> 00:10:57,803
I've got the cavalry on speed-dial.
Just... keep your head down.

160
00:10:57,853 --> 00:11:00,226
- We will. Come on, Trailer.
- [barks]

161
00:11:02,888 --> 00:11:05,944
Pete is so buying us dinner for this.
But where'd it go?

162
00:11:06,251 --> 00:11:10,253
Oh, I know. I knew Rib's Joint none of though.
Now, how to get there?

163
00:11:16,434 --> 00:11:19,098
- I don't see a door, do you?
- [barks]

164
00:11:24,912 --> 00:11:27,831
Oh... thanks for getting me past
the velvet rope, Trailer.

165
00:11:40,557 --> 00:11:43,626
It's starting again!
This way, hurry!

166
00:11:45,294 --> 00:11:47,686
The crystals must be inside
that sarcophagus.

167
00:11:47,861 --> 00:11:49,488
Now we just have to get to it.

168
00:11:49,943 --> 00:11:53,834
Come on, Trailer. Here it goes... Ahhh!

169
00:11:57,242 --> 00:11:59,436
Tear your heart out, Indiana Jones

170
00:12:04,235 --> 00:12:06,457
No-no-no, this is all wrong.

171
00:12:07,343 --> 00:12:10,451
Staying balanced... staying balanced.

172
00:12:14,805 --> 00:12:15,601
Here!

173
00:12:16,945 --> 00:12:18,245
That's better.

174
00:12:21,235 --> 00:12:23,991
Good news: Team Warehouse - one,
pyramid - zilch.

175
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,083
Don't uncork the champagne yet.

176
00:12:26,436 --> 00:12:27,885
Remember how I said - it was only
a matter of time

177
00:12:27,935 --> 00:12:30,481
before the other energy sources
come back online?

178
00:12:31,982 --> 00:12:32,713
Time's up.

179
00:13:00,431 --> 00:13:04,729
O-Okay, I did not know that...

180
00:13:05,061 --> 00:13:08,417
... or-or-or that... or THAT!!

181
00:13:11,893 --> 00:13:14,278
Thank God, I thought those
alarms would never stop.

182
00:13:14,576 --> 00:13:17,684
Any luck finding a way to clean up your
mess and turn us back to normal?

183
00:13:17,734 --> 00:13:21,352
Oh, well, no. No-not yet, but...

184
00:13:21,402 --> 00:13:24,452
...ah! did you know that M.C. Escher
designed the first

185
00:13:24,502 --> 00:13:27,199
Warehouse 13 to fold in on itself?

186
00:13:27,249 --> 00:13:30,000
Aha! Yeah, dude was bug nuts.

187
00:13:31,253 --> 00:13:32,808
Someone called for a taxi?

188
00:13:35,555 --> 00:13:38,246
- That's not annoying.
- Not as annoying as the entire Warehouse

189
00:13:38,296 --> 00:13:40,585
going haywire because we still have  to
neutralize that model.

190
00:13:40,635 --> 00:13:44,755
- Leena and Trailer went to get it.
- Well, they need to get it faster.

191
00:13:45,805 --> 00:13:48,261
- Artie, what's going on?
- The other two power sources

192
00:13:48,311 --> 00:13:50,690
from the original Warehouse are back
online and wreaking havoc,

193
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:52,424
and if we don't shut them down
immediately...

194
00:13:52,425 --> 00:13:54,404
Warehouse go boom! Yeah, we know.

195
00:13:54,454 --> 00:13:56,433
Once inside the neutralizer
processing center...

196
00:13:56,483 --> 00:13:57,324
- The Gooery?
- Yeah.

197
00:13:57,374 --> 00:13:58,896
The other is Cervante's window.

198
00:13:58,897 --> 00:14:01,211
Artie, those are on opposite sides
of the Warehouse.

199
00:14:01,261 --> 00:14:03,214
- It'll be faster if we split up.
- Yeah, agreed!

200
00:14:03,264 --> 00:14:05,800
You two take the windmill, we'll
take the Gooery. Good luck!

201
00:14:10,093 --> 00:14:12,028
- C'mon, Pete! The clock's tickin'!

202
00:14:12,078 --> 00:14:15,819
Ahh, just when the manual
is starting to get interesting.

203
00:14:19,174 --> 00:14:21,772
Uhh, smells like rotten crayons,
eww...

204
00:14:21,822 --> 00:14:22,846
No, crayons don't go bad...

205
00:14:22,896 --> 00:14:25,764
Well... well, they do, but
they 're not... not like that.

206
00:14:25,814 --> 00:14:29,617
In 1979 actually there was a banana
mania that almost brought down...

207
00:14:29,667 --> 00:14:31,789
- Artie, maybe later?
- Okay.

208
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:37,228
You shot the first Warehouse
continuous hydroelectricity,

209
00:14:37,278 --> 00:14:39,243
so why is the goo-machine freaking out?

210
00:14:39,293 --> 00:14:43,121
Because in the original design this was
the location of the  hydroelectric generator.

211
00:14:43,171 --> 00:14:44,488
So, now the things have gotten off.

212
00:14:44,538 --> 00:14:47,722
- Kludgy the Gooery is what, overcompensating?
- Precisely.

213
00:14:47,772 --> 00:14:49,955
You have to shut it down before
it floods the Warehouse.

214
00:14:50,698 --> 00:14:53,494
First you have to figure out
how to get down there.

215
00:14:53,544 --> 00:14:54,695
What about that thing?

216
00:14:56,771 --> 00:14:59,385
Administrating since Iran-contras,
but I suppose I could give it a...

217
00:14:59,435 --> 00:15:00,946
Not you, me!

218
00:15:00,996 --> 00:15:03,462
Here! Just... don't get it all gooey.

219
00:15:04,478 --> 00:15:06,998
Remember you need to close
that valve, and then ...

220
00:15:07,048 --> 00:15:10,620
Relax, grumps, I've got this!
I've been diving since...

221
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:13,006
Well, I've never been diving,
but like all things,

222
00:15:13,056 --> 00:15:14,884
I'm sure I'm good at it! Easy-peasy.

223
00:15:21,196 --> 00:15:22,813
Keep going, you're almost the...!

224
00:15:24,315 --> 00:15:26,639
THAT is not a good sound.

225
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:42,171
- Claudia, behind you!
- And that folks, is how...

226
00:15:42,221 --> 00:15:44,583
Aahh! ARTIEE !!

227
00:15:44,633 --> 00:15:47,016
HEEELP!!

228
00:15:48,391 --> 00:15:53,360
ARTIEE!! ARTIIEE, HELP!! ARTIIEE!!

229
00:16:14,194 --> 00:16:18,682
- ARTIE! STOP THIS CRAZY THIING!
- Claudia!

230
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,225
Claudia, HANG ON!

231
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:27,851
- YAAAY! Then this is over,
I'm signing up for diving lessons...

232
00:16:27,901 --> 00:16:30,369
Watch something, something to go as he [...]

233
00:16:31,643 --> 00:16:34,829
The pressure's building, something
must be coming... Oh no!

234
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:40,955
Hang on ! Come on, come on,
reverse the pressure... reversing...

235
00:16:41,859 --> 00:16:43,719
No, no, NO !!

236
00:16:44,423 --> 00:16:47,807
Damn it, not now! <i>Hold on, Claudia!</i>

237
00:16:47,857 --> 00:16:50,472
Ah! To reverse the flow
of the drainage system...

238
00:16:50,705 --> 00:16:53,029
I can't do that without the electri...

239
00:16:53,303 --> 00:16:55,275
Oh! Hello...

240
00:16:57,155 --> 00:17:01,368
This... is how it felt... for Augustus Gloop...
<i>[character from Charlie & The Chocolate Factory]</i>

241
00:17:02,405 --> 00:17:03,327
Please, work.

242
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:08,688
Yes!

243
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,133
Claudia! Oh, God...

244
00:17:22,695 --> 00:17:24,940
Easy... peasy...

245
00:17:26,434 --> 00:17:28,774
Huh... that's strange.

246
00:17:28,824 --> 00:17:32,348
Pete, listen: we've got to shut down
that other power source... NOW.

247
00:17:32,974 --> 00:17:34,269
Oh, hey, Mykes!

248
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:38,761
Ask me, which Warehouse snagged, bagged
and tagged Miguel de Cervantes's windmill?

249
00:17:38,811 --> 00:17:42,313
Which Warehouse snagged, bagged and
tagged Miguel de Cervantes's widmill, Pete?

250
00:17:42,363 --> 00:17:45,125
Oh, let me tell you, Mykes!
That would be Warehouse 10.

251
00:17:45,175 --> 00:17:48,674
Look at you - reading the manual...

252
00:17:53,625 --> 00:17:56,772
- So what else did you find out?
- Ah, just the part about the windmill.

253
00:17:57,138 --> 00:18:00,811
- Thought it might come in handy.
- You think? Let's go!

254
00:18:05,275 --> 00:18:08,344
Attaboy, Trailer. Find the diorama.

255
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:13,602
- [barks]
- I smell it, too. Something's burning.

256
00:18:14,539 --> 00:18:18,563
Oh my gosh, that's coming
from aisle YC2112.

257
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:23,212
Please tell me the artifact
isn't in the section.

258
00:18:23,262 --> 00:18:23,986
[barks]

259
00:18:27,747 --> 00:18:29,222
Of course it is.

260
00:18:49,305 --> 00:18:53,343
Well, I'd say this merits a celebratory
sing-along "We Are The Champions".

261
00:18:53,393 --> 00:18:55,198
- I'll take the harmony.
- Sh-shh...

262
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:58,207
- Feel that?
- Feel w-what ? What are we feeling?

263
00:18:58,707 --> 00:18:59,597
That heat.

264
00:18:59,647 --> 00:19:02,496
The temperature here is increased by several
degrees over the past few minutes.

265
00:19:02,546 --> 00:19:04,424
Maybe you're just going
through the change?

266
00:19:04,474 --> 00:19:06,627
Manopause hot-flashes are
common in a guy your age.

267
00:19:06,677 --> 00:19:09,099
You know, if you ever want to get
to be my age, you better just stop.

268
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:12,634
Did you figure out which aisle
the diorama is in?

269
00:19:12,684 --> 00:19:16,214
Yes. It's in YYC-2112, but everything
around is on fire.

270
00:19:16,264 --> 00:19:19,329
On fi... of course it is!
I should have known this would happen.

271
00:19:19,496 --> 00:19:22,421
- And what happened?
- I'll explain after we pick you up.

272
00:19:22,891 --> 00:19:26,979
Man-o-pause? Let me see him.

273
00:19:29,773 --> 00:19:31,799
- Hey, did you see  that ?
- See what?

274
00:19:31,849 --> 00:19:33,505
Fire, down in the stats!

275
00:19:33,555 --> 00:19:36,755
Ar-are you sure? Maybe it was just
an artifact getting its groove on.

276
00:19:36,805 --> 00:19:39,105
I mean, you know how nutty
things can be out there.

277
00:19:39,155 --> 00:19:40,382
- I guess...

278
00:19:40,432 --> 00:19:44,751
- Well, blow me down! There's our target.
- Wow!

279
00:19:47,725 --> 00:19:48,974
Okay, so here's what I'm thinking:

280
00:19:49,024 --> 00:19:51,134
we touch down at safe distance
away from the windmill,

281
00:19:51,184 --> 00:19:53,523
make our way to the  next aisle over,
and... wow!

282
00:19:53,654 --> 00:19:55,625
I got a plan. Follow my lead!

283
00:19:55,675 --> 00:19:59,952
- Wait! Pete! What are you doing?!
- Yeeee... !

284
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:05,940
Okay, so: according  to the manual...

285
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:08,332
- Did...did I mention I read the manual?
- Pete!

286
00:20:08,382 --> 00:20:11,500
All right. Anyway, there's a bunch of gears
inside that thing.

287
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:13,372
All we got to do is come up the works,

288
00:20:13,422 --> 00:20:15,711
and that should take the wind
out of those sails!

289
00:20:15,761 --> 00:20:17,969
- Oh, is that all?
- Don't worry!

290
00:20:18,019 --> 00:20:20,889
I believe I've proven pretty conclusively
that I can gum up

291
00:20:20,939 --> 00:20:23,013
- anything I set my mind to.
- True!

292
00:20:23,063 --> 00:20:27,272
First, I have to figure  out how to get
past that... Awww! That left a mark!

293
00:20:28,141 --> 00:20:29,757
Hey, look out!

294
00:20:30,725 --> 00:20:35,185
- This wind is getting stronger!
- Allright, grab hold of something, quick!

295
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:47,922
We need a way to [...] OR SOMETHING!!

296
00:20:47,972 --> 00:20:50,649
Or-or maybe an artifact!
Just wait here!

297
00:20:50,699 --> 00:20:54,253
- Where the hell are you going?
- Just... be right back! Probably...

298
00:21:21,034 --> 00:21:26,453
Oh-God-oh-God-oh-God-oh-God!
OH GOOOOD !!!

299
00:21:29,461 --> 00:21:32,707
- Gotcha!
- Pete, thank God! Wait...

300
00:21:32,936 --> 00:21:35,805
- We're not getting blown away, how did you...?
- Increase density?

<i>[a famous bodybulider]</i>

302
00:21:39,817 --> 00:21:42,630
God, did you remind  me
why I switched to boxers?

303
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,890
The boys can't breathe at all!

304
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:46,777
Well they can hold their breath for a few
more minutes! Now can you please...

305
00:21:46,827 --> 00:21:49,406
-... get us inside the windmill?
- Hang on!

306
00:21:53,777 --> 00:21:56,084
- Ehhh... Aww!
- What's wrong?

307
00:21:56,134 --> 00:22:01,170
Artifact downside. Thinking maybe I shouldn't
crank the density all the way to 11.

308
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:04,060
Wait! The trunks don't just increase
the person's density,

309
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:06,435
they also increase strength!
Right?

310
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:09,462
- Yeah, so?
- So, how's your arm?

311
00:22:09,512 --> 00:22:12,800
Ah, well, they didn't call me Dr. Kay
literally for nothing, but...

312
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:13,918
- Throw me.
-Say what? - Throw me!

313
00:22:13,968 --> 00:22:15,978
Throw me! Right down the mill!

314
00:22:16,028 --> 00:22:18,547
Mykes, do you know what
those giant blades will do if I miss?

315
00:22:18,597 --> 00:22:20,972
Then don't miss! Just do it,
Pete, I trust you!

316
00:22:21,022 --> 00:22:24,117
- Okay?
- Okay, you said it, I didn't!

317
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:37,091
Gotta stop those gear somehow...
Wait, is that...?

318
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:41,680
Oh my God, it is! Don Quixote's lance !

319
00:22:41,939 --> 00:22:46,178
"Fortune is guiding our affairs better
than we ourselves could have wished."

320
00:22:53,236 --> 00:22:56,330
Huh! So nice toss there, Dr. Kay.

321
00:22:56,877 --> 00:22:59,766
Thanks. So, look, um... I'm...

322
00:22:59,816 --> 00:23:03,826
...not totally comfortable
asking you this, Mykes, but, um...

323
00:23:04,078 --> 00:23:06,138
... can you help me take off my undies?

324
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:12,774
And that, ladies and gentlemen,
is how I went from zero...

325
00:23:12,824 --> 00:23:14,965
- ...to hero!
- Okay, okay.

326
00:23:15,015 --> 00:23:17,548
Now can you  just please call Artie
and tell him that...

327
00:23:17,598 --> 00:23:20,716
[both coughing heavily]

328
00:23:20,766 --> 00:23:24,995
- What?
- It's com... it's coming from the vents!

329
00:23:27,341 --> 00:23:30,047
We need to go to the Lehmann Fornax
right now. Get in!

330
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:32,612
Is that there all  that smoke
is coming from?

331
00:23:32,662 --> 00:23:35,414
Where there's smoke, there's fire,
and if we do not contain it fast...

332
00:23:35,643 --> 00:23:38,297
...a second Warehouse 13
is gonna burn  down.

333
00:24:00,673 --> 00:24:03,197
Take the next right, the Lehmann Fornax
is just around the corner.

334
00:24:06,153 --> 00:24:08,250
OKay. More weirdness.

335
00:24:08,495 --> 00:24:11,533
- We must have made wrong turn.
- Wth the Prius'es navigation system?

336
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:12,650
Don't even play.

337
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:16,666
Alright, then why is there wall here
when there's supposed to be a door?

338
00:24:16,716 --> 00:24:21,698
Because what's on the other side of it
didn't exist in the original  version.

339
00:24:22,582 --> 00:24:24,636
Inge Lehmann discovered the Earth
superheated core

340
00:24:24,686 --> 00:24:27,167
AFTER  the original Warehouse 13
went down.

341
00:24:27,217 --> 00:24:31,400
Which means Edison, Tesla, and Usher would
never have thought to use it as a power source.

342
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:34,637
So [...] diorama downgraded the Warehouse
from 4G to  dial-up.

343
00:24:34,687 --> 00:24:37,849
Fornax got disconnected just like
the computer system.

344
00:24:37,899 --> 00:24:40,389
But the vent to the center of the Earth
is still open...

345
00:24:40,439 --> 00:24:41,851
And still active.

346
00:24:42,497 --> 00:24:45,082
We've got to get through this wall
before this place explodes.

347
00:24:45,736 --> 00:24:50,113
Aisle UNT8441, you're looking for
an oversized pepper mill.

348
00:24:50,359 --> 00:24:53,100
Meantime Leena and I will try
putting out fires, literally.

349
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:56,975
Shotgun! Here, pepermill... nope!

350
00:24:57,025 --> 00:24:59,970
Nope! Not back there.

351
00:25:01,172 --> 00:25:02,831
- Any luck, Mykes?
- None.

352
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,206
- Claud?
- Yeah, I'll  bet.

353
00:25:05,929 --> 00:25:08,327
Maybe there's something else
we can  use instead.

354
00:25:08,627 --> 00:25:11,390
- Yeah, like John Henry's sledgehammer.
- Keep looking.

355
00:25:15,372 --> 00:25:16,127
Wow.

356
00:25:16,177 --> 00:25:17,893
- The vibe?
- Mensa.

357
00:25:17,943 --> 00:25:20,958
I'm guessing... it might have
something to do  with that.

358
00:25:23,698 --> 00:25:24,827
Uh-oh...

359
00:25:40,303 --> 00:25:43,116
I... think we just found
our sledgehammer.

360
00:25:48,481 --> 00:25:50,636
What is he doing with the Lumiere
brothers' cinematograph?

361
00:25:50,916 --> 00:25:52,788
One side, coming through!

362
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,702
- Well, that's one way to do it.
- Okay. So now what?

363
00:26:15,752 --> 00:26:18,909
We get in there, we act fast, we get out
and we do it as a team. Everybody ready?

364
00:26:18,959 --> 00:26:20,963
- Ready! - Ready! [...] way.
- [barks]

365
00:26:21,013 --> 00:26:22,861
Let's go save the Warehouse.
Again.

366
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:52,380
Weeell, this is another fine mess.

367
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:55,270
Alright, people. The fate of the Warehouse
is in our hands.

368
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:59,073
We've got to stabilize the temperature in here
before this whole place goes up in flames.

369
00:26:59,123 --> 00:27:03,496
Oh yes, because it's just so simple  to stabilize
the temperature inside the Earth's core.

370
00:27:03,546 --> 00:27:06,445
Wait. The Fornax is the furnace
that heats the Warehouse.

371
00:27:06,495 --> 00:27:09,595
We can find a way to reconnect it, we
should be able  to control the thermostat.

372
00:27:09,645 --> 00:27:13,054
Excellent idea! But, in the meantime
there's still a lot of fires to be containing.

373
00:27:13,104 --> 00:27:15,981
- Ok, Trailer and I will take care
of it. Right, boy ?
- [barks]

374
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:19,962
Claudia, you and I will prep the coolant
system. If it's not ready...

375
00:27:20,012 --> 00:27:23,458
- ... the second we're back online...
- We all end up extra crispy. Understood!

376
00:27:25,554 --> 00:27:27,444
Pete, Myka, you'll have to
re-establish the connection

377
00:27:27,494 --> 00:27:29,401
- between the Fornax and the Warehouse.
- Okay.

378
00:27:29,711 --> 00:27:30,895
Where do we do that?

379
00:27:36,311 --> 00:27:38,901
Yeah, I should've worn
my work shoes...

380
00:27:42,794 --> 00:27:46,623
Whew! Yeah,  this steam is gonna
wreak havoc my pores.

381
00:27:46,673 --> 00:27:49,379
Those ducts, tha-that's gotta be
the problem, right there!

382
00:27:49,429 --> 00:27:53,231
Oh, I'd say our problems are
way bigger than that.

383
00:27:58,812 --> 00:28:00,732
- How's it coming?
- Coming, stop asking.

384
00:28:00,782 --> 00:28:04,665
I'm just saying, we have a very
small but significant window of...

385
00:28:05,401 --> 00:28:08,673
- Did... we do that?
- I don't know what did that

386
00:28:08,723 --> 00:28:11,482
- Okay. Now you're scaring me.
- You and me both.

387
00:28:12,046 --> 00:28:14,542
- Attaboy, keep spraying!
- [barks]

388
00:28:15,623 --> 00:28:17,380
Pete there's another one of these
across-the catwalks.

389
00:28:17,381 --> 00:28:19,730
Just get over there and
start cranking.

390
00:28:21,321 --> 00:28:25,714
Whoa, boy! Feet, don't
fail me now! Hyaaah!

391
00:28:30,881 --> 00:28:35,428
- Ready? On three!
- One! Two! <i>THREE!!</i>

392
00:28:39,382 --> 00:28:41,648
It's working! Keep turning!

393
00:28:46,088 --> 00:28:49,054
- Now! Claudia, now!
- I'm right here! Stop yelling!

394
00:29:03,217 --> 00:29:04,912
Victoryy!

395
00:29:07,532 --> 00:29:09,529
Nice work everyone. You did it!

396
00:29:09,579 --> 00:29:10,910
Fantastic!

397
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:15,850
- Now can we please just neutralize
the stupid artifact?
- God, yes, by all means.

398
00:29:17,294 --> 00:29:22,859
O-o-oh! Maaajor vibe-age.
Ah! Correction: uber major vibe-age!

399
00:29:24,525 --> 00:29:28,133
- Aahhh! 
- Okay. Better buckle up, guys.

400
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:31,446
Something tells me this ride's about
to get a wee bit bumpy.

401
00:29:53,444 --> 00:29:56,664
My God! The Warehouse
is folding itself up.

402
00:29:56,714 --> 00:29:59,124
This is all M.C. freakin' Esher's fault!

403
00:29:59,174 --> 00:30:01,124
I told you that guy was bug nuts!

404
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:04,371
Flattened by a giant M.C.Esher's
version of the Warehouse.

405
00:30:04,421 --> 00:30:06,335
Yet another way I'd never thought
I'd be killed.

406
00:30:06,385 --> 00:30:09,144
Really? I actually kinda pictured
something like this.

407
00:30:09,194 --> 00:30:12,037
No one is getting killed! We're gonna find
 that stupid diorama,

408
00:30:12,087 --> 00:30:14,121
we're gonna neutralize the
hell out of it!

409
00:30:14,171 --> 00:30:16,096
Everybody  into the car, quickly!

410
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:21,716
- We need to get back to aisle YYC2112.
- Entering coordinates...

411
00:30:22,475 --> 00:30:24,347
Destination locked and loaded.
Hang on!

412
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:30,928
Claudia, look out!

413
00:30:33,307 --> 00:30:34,460
Take the next left!

414
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:38,512
If we cut through [...] 84C, we can
double back past the Dark Vault!

415
00:30:38,562 --> 00:30:42,484
- Or get sucked into it!
- Cross'em if you got'em!

416
00:30:45,995 --> 00:30:47,774
Brake! Brake! BRAKE!!

417
00:30:49,798 --> 00:30:53,721
- Back! Back! BACK!!
- I'm backing, I'm backing!

418
00:30:54,693 --> 00:30:57,221
- Ah! We're stuck...
- Oh ye of little faith!

419
00:31:03,585 --> 00:31:05,625
Whoo...

420
00:31:09,865 --> 00:31:12,000
...oaaah!

421
00:31:16,899 --> 00:31:18,018
There it is!

422
00:31:19,425 --> 00:31:21,254
Go, go, go!

423
00:31:21,985 --> 00:31:23,571
[barks]

424
00:31:24,552 --> 00:31:27,716
- Over here!
- Pete, did you break the Inka Vase...

425
00:31:27,766 --> 00:31:30,644
Artie, you can yell at me later,
okay? Come on!

426
00:31:30,962 --> 00:31:32,637
Look! The diorama!

427
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:37,833
- Shut it off, shut it off!
- What's it look like I'm doing?

428
00:31:45,708 --> 00:31:48,630
Whoa! Huh! Ha-ha...
Oh, yeah!

429
00:31:49,596 --> 00:31:52,172
- Nice... okay...
- All right...

430
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:55,003
All right!

431
00:31:58,201 --> 00:32:02,330
- Let's not do that again.
- Yes, let's not... do that... again.

432
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:05,499
-[barks]
- It's alright, it's alright, I forgive you.

433
00:32:05,549 --> 00:32:09,394
Okay, look - now that we're 3-dimensional
again, I really want to get back to my book.

434
00:32:09,444 --> 00:32:11,460
Oh yeah, and I have inventory
to finish up.

435
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:14,849
- Lift, Claud?
- Next stop, Artie's office.

436
00:32:16,342 --> 00:32:18,985
- Hey Pete, you coming?
- No thanks, me and T-dog

437
00:32:19,035 --> 00:32:20,702
have a Super Bowl win here.

438
00:32:20,752 --> 00:32:23,307
Aw, aw, aw, aw!

439
00:32:23,357 --> 00:32:27,054
- Take it... outside!
- Yes, papa.

440
00:32:27,934 --> 00:32:30,234
- [barks]
- Alright, alright!

441
00:32:31,361 --> 00:32:33,670
- Hooah!
- Stay outta trouble!

442
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:37,151
- Touchdown!
- [barks]

443
00:32:37,741 --> 00:32:41,361
Worst rainy day ever.
Come on, Trailer.
