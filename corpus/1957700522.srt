00:15:58,292 --> 00:16:01,261
This entire city is angry.

353
00:16:01,295 --> 00:16:04,064
So we are on high alert
until school opens.

354
00:16:04,097 --> 00:16:06,099
Now I need to talk
to Officers Coughlin,

355
00:16:06,133 --> 00:16:07,635
Riley, Jefferson.

356
00:16:07,669 --> 00:16:09,571
The rest of youse, be careful.

357
00:16:09,604 --> 00:16:13,508
And remember, be sure
to make it home to.?

358
00:16:13,541 --> 00:16:14,542
-Our families.

359
00:16:14,576 --> 00:16:16,611
-Your families. Let's go.

360
00:16:16,644 --> 00:16:19,547
[overlapping chattering]

361
00:16:28,222 --> 00:16:30,090
[telephone ringing in distance]

362
00:16:33,595 --> 00:16:35,095
-Everything okay, Cap?

363
00:16:35,128 --> 00:16:36,128
-Yeah.

364
00:16:38,465 --> 00:16:41,034
You might wanna wipe
that smirk off your face.

365
00:16:41,068 --> 00:16:41,970
-What the fuck?

366
00:16:42,002 --> 00:16:44,371
-You and Riley won't
be working together.

367
00:16:44,404 --> 00:16:46,574
-Come on. Why, Cap?

368
00:16:46,608 --> 00:16:48,408
-Because you, Officer Coughlin,

369
00:16:48,442 --> 00:16:52,079
and you, Officer Jefferson,
will be reassigned to Southie.

370
00:16:52,112 --> 00:16:53,491
Jefferson, you will be
on the bus with the kids.

371
00:16:53,515 --> 00:16:55,750
Coughlin, you will escort
those kids into Southie High.

372
00:16:55,783 --> 00:16:57,484
-What? Cap, why?

373
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:59,286
I like it here.

374
00:16:59,319 --> 00:17:01,355
-Because higher-ups
told me to pick two men

375
00:17:01,388 --> 00:17:04,091
that I thought could
relate to the poor people

376
00:17:04,124 --> 00:17:06,226
that are affected by
this whole fiasco.

377
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,337
-Why don't they
leave good alone?

378
00:17:07,361 --> 00:17:08,161
-No offense, Jefferson,

379
00:17:08,195 --> 00:17:09,272
but mixing the
Black and white kids

380
00:17:09,296 --> 00:17:12,232
from the poorest neighborhoods
is not a good idea.

381
00:17:12,266 --> 00:17:13,701
-No, I get it.

382
00:17:13,735 --> 00:17:15,895
All I'm saying is it's going
to be tough for everybody.

383
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:22,376
-Cap, my neighbors
will turn against me.

384
00:17:22,409 --> 00:17:24,211
-Hm.

385
00:17:24,244 --> 00:17:26,380
Remember five minutes ago

386
00:17:26,413 --> 00:17:31,719
when I said let's keep
our feelings out of this?

387
00:17:31,753 --> 00:17:33,655
Let's keep our
feelings out this.

388
00:17:33,688 --> 00:17:36,624
And your new partner
Jefferson is right. Huh?

389
00:17:36,658 --> 00:17:39,293
This isn't going to be
easy. We all know that.

390
00:17:39,326 --> 00:17:41,428
But I picked the two of you
because, well, Jefferson,

391
00:17:41,461 --> 00:17:42,429
you're Black.

392
00:17:42,462 --> 00:17:43,430
-He's Black?

393
00:17:43,463 --> 00:17:46,233
-Yeah, he's Black.

394
00:17:46,266 --> 00:17:48,703
And these kids need somebody
that they can identify with.

395
00:17:48,736 --> 00:17:50,170
-Mm-hm.

396
00:17:50,203 --> 00:17:51,506
-And I picked you, Coughlin,

397
00:17:51,539 --> 00:17:53,708
because you're from
the neighborhood.

398
00:17:53,741 --> 00:17:55,877
And I'm hoping that maybe
you can talk some sense

399
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:58,513
into your neighbors off hours.

400
00:17:58,546 --> 00:18:01,148
Besides, all these kids,
the kids on the bus,

401
00:18:01,181 --> 00:18:02,850
they know you from Roxbury.

402
00:18:02,884 --> 00:18:03,885
Huh?

403
00:18:03,918 --> 00:18:06,286
You got a good rep.

404
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,188
-Are you fucking
kidding me? I'm fucked.

405
00:18:08,221 --> 00:18:12,492
I might as well paint my face
black walking with those kids.

406
00:18:12,527 --> 00:18:13,460
No offense, Jefferson.

407
00:18:13,493 --> 00:18:15,830
-No. None taken.

408
00:18:15,863 --> 00:18:17,130
-You come back after your shift

409
00:18:17,164 --> 00:18:18,609
and I'll paint your
face black for you.

410
00:18:18,633 --> 00:18:21,134
Otherwise, you
fucking figure it out,

411
00:18:21,168 --> 00:18:22,208
because your name's in it.

412
00:18:24,204 --> 00:18:25,844
-This busing is gonna
rip this city apart.

413
00:18:27,441 --> 00:18:29,677
-Hey. Listen, man.

414
00:18:29,711 --> 00:18:31,646
We need to integrate, okay?

415
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:33,213
Don't be racist.

416
00:18:33,246 --> 00:18:34,582
-Racist!

417
00:18:34,616 --> 00:18:37,284
You think I am?

418
00:18:37,317 --> 00:18:39,721
-No. Just a regular
old Bobby Kennedy.

419
00:18:41,656 --> 00:18:42,656
-Racist.

420
00:18:44,191 --> 00:18:45,660
[door lock beeping]

421
00:18:45,693 --> 00:18:46,693
[gate opening]

422
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:02,844
[gate closing]

423
00:19:05,312 --> 00:19:08,348
[dramatic music]

424
00:19:29,804 --> 00:19:32,874
[soft rock music]

425
00:19:51,693 --> 00:19:52,693
[car door opens]

426
00:19:55,029 --> 00:19:56,029
[car door closes]

427
00:19:57,965 --> 00:19:59,299
-Welcome home.

428
00:20:01,703 --> 00:20:04,404
-[laugh]

429
00:20:04,438 --> 00:20:07,474
-Feels good to be
out of that rathole.

430
00:20:07,508 --> 00:20:11,344
Twelve years wasted 'cause of
that piece of shit Coughlin.

431
00:20:11,378 --> 00:20:13,480
Yeah. What's the verdict on him?

432
00:20:13,514 --> 00:20:14,834
- Hm?
- What's the verdict on him?

433
00:20:17,852 --> 00:20:19,587
-The same.

434
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:21,388
-Are you fucking kidding me?

435
00:20:21,421 --> 00:20:23,658
What is it with you and him?

436
00:20:23,691 --> 00:20:26,894
-Are you questioning me?

437
00:20:26,928 --> 00:20:30,263
-No. Of course not.

438
00:20:31,498 --> 00:20:32,498
-Hm.

439
00:20:34,736 --> 00:20:37,471
- [Lamont hums]
- [paper ripping]

440
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:44,512
-Dad?

441
00:20:44,545 --> 00:20:45,545
-Yeah.

442
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:50,650
-Is that the letter?

443
00:20:54,488 --> 00:20:56,323
-Yeah.

444
00:20:56,356 --> 00:20:57,457
Sit down, babe.

445
00:21:01,629 --> 00:21:02,629
-What's wrong?

446
00:21:04,532 --> 00:21:05,867
Roxbury High, right?

447
00:21:07,802 --> 00:21:09,537
[car passes by in distance]

448
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:10,570
-Southie.

449
00:21:21,048 --> 00:21:22,092
-What am... What
am I going to do?

450
00:21:22,116 --> 00:21:23,718
They hate us.

451
00:21:23,751 --> 00:21:25,520
-Hey, you're right.

452
00:21:25,553 --> 00:21:28,890
They're gonna call you
every name possible.

453
00:21:28,923 --> 00:21:30,591
And liberal Massachusetts
ain't no better

454
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:33,828
than confederate Alabama.

455
00:21:33,861 --> 00:21:38,465
But there is nothing
that you can't handle.

456
00:21:38,498 --> 00:21:41,002
And what have we
learned about hate?

457
00:21:41,035 --> 00:21:42,937
-That it's like
an addictive drug,

458
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:45,438
because people who hate
have low self-esteem,

459
00:21:45,472 --> 00:21:46,339
and putting others down

460
00:21:46,373 --> 00:21:49,376
makes them feel better
about themselves.

461
00:21:49,409 --> 00:21:52,613
-And what does
the Bible teach us

462
00:21:52,647 --> 00:21:54,949
about how to deal with
those that hate us?

463
00:21:54,982 --> 00:21:55,982
-We should pray for them.

464
00:21:57,652 --> 00:21:59,386
-Good.

465
00:21:59,419 --> 00:22:01,956
And how do we overcome hate?

466
00:22:03,724 --> 00:22:04,724
-With love.

467
00:22:06,493 --> 00:22:07,595
Dad, I'm scared.

468
00:22:08,663 --> 00:22:09,663
-I know.

469
00:22:11,431 --> 00:22:13,701
But we're gonna try
and be brave, right?

470
00:22:19,472 --> 00:22:20,842
[knock on door]

471
00:22:20,875 --> 00:22:22,409
-I have the letter.

472
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:25,780
You're going to Southie.

473
00:22:25,813 --> 00:22:28,149
-Oh, yes!

474
00:22:28,182 --> 00:22:30,618
Oh, my god. Yes.

475
00:22:30,651 --> 00:22:35,455
[chuckles] I'm so happy.

476
00:22:35,488 --> 00:22:36,757
I can stay.

477
00:22:36,791 --> 00:22:37,791
-Kate.

478
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:43,998
It's going to be different
with Black kids there.

479
00:22:44,031 --> 00:22:45,031
-Mm.

480
00:22:53,507 --> 00:22:56,577
Why do niggas have to go
to our school anyways?

481
00:22:56,611 --> 00:22:58,512
-Kate. Don't use that
language in this house.

482
00:22:58,546 --> 00:22:59,513
You know better.

483
00:22:59,547 --> 00:23:01,749
-Or what?

484
00:23:01,782 --> 00:23:03,416
What? Like we're
not from Southie

485
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:05,596
where the word isn't thrown
around like confetti anyways.

486
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:07,487
-Change that tone.

487
00:23:07,521 --> 00:23:09,700
And don't tell me what people
are saying in the streets.

488
00:23:09,724 --> 00:23:11,759
I worry about my own home.

489
00:23:11,792 --> 00:23:17,865
-I know. It's just...
it's not fair, you know?

490
00:23:17,899 --> 00:23:20,835
The Blacks coming to our
school, causing problems.

491
00:23:20,868 --> 00:23:23,604
It's just gonna ruin
our senior year.

492
00:23:26,807 --> 00:23:28,910
-I understand.

493
00:23:28,943 --> 00:23:30,678
It's okay to be angry.

494
00:23:31,979 --> 00:23:34,148
But don't take it out on others.

495
00:23:34,181 --> 00:23:36,449
Calling people
names or acting out

496
00:23:36,483 --> 00:23:40,888
will make the
situation worse. Hm?

497
00:23:40,922 --> 00:23:43,658
We have to be good Catholics
and love our neighbors

498
00:23:43,691 --> 00:23:44,926
as we love ourselves.

499
00:23:44,959 --> 00:23:46,203
-Yeah, but they're
not our neighbors.

500
00:23:46,227 --> 00:23:47,528
That's the problem.

501
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,068
I'm gonna call Cheryl.

502
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:56,671
[giggling]

503
00:24:00,508 --> 00:24:02,710
- [baby crying in distance]
- [dog barking in distance]

504
00:24:02,743 --> 00:24:03,854
-I don't fucking believe this.

505
00:24:03,878 --> 00:24:08,549
Cheryl! Will you get down here?

506
00:24:08,582 --> 00:24:11,052
[footsteps]

[paper rustles]

508
00:24:21,595 --> 00:24:23,496
-Dad, what is this?

509
00:24:23,531 --> 00:24:25,633
This isn't fair. I'm not
going to Roxbury High.

510
00:24:25,666 --> 00:24:26,977
I'll be the only
white kid in there.

511
00:24:27,001 --> 00:24:28,602
-What you want me to do?

512
00:24:28,636 --> 00:24:29,537
-I don't know, call somebody.

513
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:31,105
You know people.

514
00:24:31,138 --> 00:24:34,175
-If any of those coons
put a hand on you

515
00:24:34,208 --> 00:24:36,844
so help me God, I'll kill 'em.

516
00:24:36,877 --> 00:24:38,079
I'll kill 'em all.

517
00:24:38,112 --> 00:24:39,914
-I thought we could
pick her school.

518
00:24:39,947 --> 00:24:41,048
It's her senior year.

519
00:24:41,082 --> 00:24:43,117
-I don't know and I
don't give a shit.

520
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:45,886
They keep changing
the rules as they go.

521
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:48,923
[phone ringing]

522
00:24:48,956 --> 00:24:50,224
-[into phone] Hello?

523
00:24:50,257 --> 00:24:52,660
-[into phone] Hi.
Is Cheryl there?

524
00:24:52,693 --> 00:24:55,629
-[into phone] Kate.
Yes, she's here.

525
00:24:58,199 --> 00:24:59,800
-[into phone] Hello?

526
00:24:59,834 --> 00:25:02,103
-[into phone] I'm
going to Southie!

527
00:25:02,136 --> 00:25:03,204
-[Pat chuckles]

528
00:25:06,607 --> 00:25:08,676
-[into phone] Cheryl,
are you there?

529
00:25:08,709 --> 00:25:09,744
Cheryl, you there?

530
00:25:11,645 --> 00:25:13,605
-[into phone] Yeah. They're

00:33:16,631 --> 00:33:18,432
My parents came
into this country

708
00:33:18,465 --> 00:33:21,335
and threw me into school
where I had no friends

709
00:33:21,368 --> 00:33:23,538
and spoke maybe ten
words of English.

710
00:33:26,173 --> 00:33:28,442
I got bullied because
I had a funny accent.

711
00:33:33,247 --> 00:33:36,684
Johnny was the first
kid who was nice to me.

712
00:33:36,718 --> 00:33:40,522
But as soon as I found out
how bad he was, I ran away.

713
00:33:41,789 --> 00:33:44,424
I never mentioned it
'cause it was nothing.

714
00:33:44,458 --> 00:33:47,595
Hm? I love you.

715
00:33:53,668 --> 00:33:56,838
[engine roaring in distance]

716
00:33:56,871 --> 00:33:58,438
-Where's Kate?

717
00:33:58,472 --> 00:34:00,708
-In her room.

718
00:34:00,742 --> 00:34:02,476
I don't like how you're acting.

719
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:04,230
-What's the name of
that kid who likes Kate?

720
00:34:05,445 --> 00:34:06,480
-Marty?

721
00:34:09,316 --> 00:34:11,318
You-Ah, just give me a minute.

722
00:34:11,351 --> 00:34:13,788
Kate!

723
00:34:13,821 --> 00:34:15,289
Kate!
- Yeah?

724
00:34:15,322 --> 00:34:18,292
-Get down here, now!

725
00:34:18,325 --> 00:34:19,503
-Bill, are you gonna
keep me in the dark

726
00:34:19,527 --> 00:34:21,328
or let me know what
the hell is going on?

727
00:34:21,361 --> 00:34:24,298
[footsteps approaching]

728
00:34:25,365 --> 00:34:27,602
-Yeah?

729
00:34:27,635 --> 00:34:31,539
-Ah, John Bunkley, are you
and him in any kind of,

730
00:34:31,573 --> 00:34:33,240
you know?

731
00:34:33,273 --> 00:34:36,243
-[scoffs] What... what
are you talking about?

732
00:34:36,276 --> 00:34:37,512
- Answer the question.
- No!

733
00:34:37,545 --> 00:34:40,147
- Don't play stupid.
- No!

734
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:43,383
-Stay away from him.
You hear me? I mean it.

735
00:34:43,417 --> 00:34:45,485
-Okay. Mom, what's going on?

736
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:46,588
-I don't know.

737
00:34:46,621 --> 00:34:47,941
Your dad came home
acting strange.

738
00:34:50,457 --> 00:34:52,217
-Go to your room. Let
me talk to your mother.

739
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,629
-Dad, you okay?

740
00:34:54,662 --> 00:34:55,662
-Yeah, I'm fine. Are you?

741
00:34:57,197 --> 00:34:58,198
Go!

742
00:34:58,231 --> 00:35:01,301
[footsteps receding]

743
00:35:04,706 --> 00:35:06,741
[approaching footsteps]

744
00:35:06,774 --> 00:35:08,275
[Bill sighs]

745
00:35:10,344 --> 00:35:12,680
Your mom told me the
good and bad news.

746
00:35:16,718 --> 00:35:18,720
It's tough not
having your partner.

747
00:35:20,822 --> 00:35:22,389
I had the same issue today.

748
00:35:23,925 --> 00:35:25,125
-Really, what happened?

749
00:35:32,767 --> 00:35:34,368
-They moved me to Southie.

750
00:35:36,871 --> 00:35:39,272
I'll be escorting the
Black kids into the school.

751
00:35:43,778 --> 00:35:45,522
-Oh my god, it keeps
getting worse and worse.

752
00:35:45,546 --> 00:35:47,280
You're gonna be with.

753
00:35:47,314 --> 00:35:52,520
You're gonna be with me on
my senior year at Southie?

754
00:35:52,553 --> 00:35:54,354
-Come on. Is it that bad?

755
00:35:54,388 --> 00:36:00,628
-Yeah! Yeah, it is!
Everything is going wrong.

756
00:36:00,662 --> 00:36:04,532
-Look, kid, they forced
this bussing thing

757
00:36:04,565 --> 00:36:05,399
down our throats.

758
00:36:05,432 --> 00:36:06,510
It's not fair, I know.
- Yeah, I know.

759
00:36:06,534 --> 00:36:08,479
I told Mom that and she
got all bent out of shape.

760
00:36:08,503 --> 00:36:09,947
-Well, you said a
little more than that.

761
00:36:09,971 --> 00:36:12,540
-I'm just saying what
everybody else has been saying.

762
00:36:12,573 --> 00:36:14,842
If I call them Black or nigger,
it's not... it's not me.

763
00:36:14,876 --> 00:36:17,310
-Hey, hey, hey,
hey. Stop, okay?

764
00:36:17,344 --> 00:36:19,514
Your mother doesn't allow
that language in this house.

765
00:36:19,547 --> 00:36:21,415
-Okay, I'm sorry,
Dad. But I'm...

766
00:36:21,448 --> 00:36:23,283
-No buts, okay?

767
00:36:23,316 --> 00:36:25,753
Don't say that word.

768
00:36:25,787 --> 00:36:27,427
Where'd you learn to
say things like that?

769
00:36:27,454 --> 00:36:28,556
-Um.

770
00:36:29,724 --> 00:36:33,226
You and your friends?

771
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:35,930
And practically everybody
in the neighborhood.

772
00:36:35,963 --> 00:36:39,634
-[inhales deeply]

773
00:36:39,667 --> 00:36:42,402
Listen, if I tolerated
that word, it was wrong.

774
00:36:42,436 --> 00:36:45,305
Okay, I understand
you're disappointed

775
00:36:45,338 --> 00:36:46,784
but that doesn't give
you or me the right

776
00:36:46,808 --> 00:36:48,710
to call Black people
names, or anyone.

777
00:36:48,743 --> 00:36:50,377
-Hm.

778
00:36:50,410 --> 00:36:52,312
-Okay?

779
00:36:52,345 --> 00:36:53,447
Look at me.

780
00:36:55,482 --> 00:36:59,453
[chuckles] Okay?

781
00:36:59,486 --> 00:37:04,257
-All I want is a
normal senior year.

782
00:37:04,291 --> 00:37:05,960
What is wrong with that?

783
00:37:05,993 --> 00:37:07,604
-Nothing. If I could do
something about it, I would.

784
00:37:07,628 --> 00:37:09,329
-Yeah, but we can't.

785
00:37:09,362 --> 00:37:11,274
The only thing we can do is keep
them from coming to my school.

786
00:37:11,298 --> 00:37:15,570
-Don't get sucked up into all
the neighborhood nonsense.

787
00:37:15,603 --> 00:37:16,604
It's poison.

788
00:37:19,507 --> 00:37:20,508
You hear me?

789
00:37:21,609 --> 00:37:22,610
I mean it.

790
00:37:22,643 --> 00:37:24,011
-Mm.

791
00:37:24,045 --> 00:37:26,514
-And why is Johnny talking
about you and his son?

792
00:37:28,482 --> 00:37:29,784
-That's not what you think.

793
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:34,420
-Huh.

794
00:37:35,623 --> 00:37:37,390
What do I think?

795
00:37:37,424 --> 00:37:38,391
Huh? You know my thoughts now?

796
00:37:38,425 --> 00:37:40,561
You gonna tell me what I think?
- Don't get mad.

797
00:37:40,595 --> 00:37:41,629
-Do I look mad?

798
00:37:41,662 --> 00:37:42,964
I'm perfectly calm.
- Yeah, okay.

799
00:37:42,997 --> 00:37:46,299
Do you know that, uh,
job that Cheryl's got

800
00:37:46,333 --> 00:37:47,668
at McLaughlin's
office right now?

801
00:37:51,973 --> 00:37:55,977
Sometimes I just. I just
go there to hang out.

802
00:37:56,010 --> 00:37:57,879
-What? You shittin' me, right?

803
00:37:57,912 --> 00:37:59,747
Fuck!
- Bill, stop cursing.

804
00:37:59,781 --> 00:38:01,783
-Pat! Patty, get up here now.

805
00:38:01,816 --> 00:38:03,560
How many times have I
told you not to hang out

806
00:38:03,584 --> 00:38:04,986
with those people?

807
00:38:05,019 --> 00:38:07,555
You see them, you
say hi and bye.

808
00:38:07,588 --> 00:38:08,656
That's it.

809
00:38:08,689 --> 00:38:09,757
-What's the matter?

810
00:38:09,791 --> 00:38:10,925
-Tell your mother.

811
00:38:10,958 --> 00:38:12,627
-What is it, Kate?

812
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:14,762
-She's been hanging
around McLaughlin's place.

813
00:38:17,965 --> 00:38:20,433
-That explains why she's
using that kind of language.

814
00:38:20,467 --> 00:38:25,039
-You know what? Both
of you are hypocrites.

815
00:38:25,072 --> 00:38:26,083
What? You think you're
better than them?

816
00:38:26,107 --> 00:38:27,708
You're not.

817
00:38:27,742 --> 00:38:29,620
I've heard all the stories
about you growing up, Dad.

818
00:38:29,644 --> 00:38:32,613
So don't tell me
about those people.

819
00:38:32,647 --> 00:38:35,683
Don't tell me about those people
because you are those people!

820
00:38:35,716 --> 00:38:36,951
You are!

821
00:38:36,984 --> 00:38:38,485
-Watch how you talk
to your father.

822
00:38:38,519 --> 00:38:40,822
-I have to take a walk,

823
00:38:40,855 --> 00:38:43,858
or I'm gonna say
somethin' I regret.

824
00:38:43,891 --> 00:38:45,092
-I think we all need a moment.

825
00:38:45,126 --> 00:38:47,695
[receding footsteps]

826
00:38:47,728 --> 00:38:50,631
You need to think about
the company you keep.

827
00:38:53,601 --> 00:38:54,836
-[Kate groans]

828
00:38:58,405 --> 00:38:59,674
[whispers] I hate them.

829
00:39:01,943 --> 00:39:04,111
[dog barking in distance]

830
00:39:04,145 --> 00:39:06,714
[birds chirping]

831
00:39:06,747 --> 00:39:08,627
-Cannot believe they are
shipping me to Southie.

832
00:39:11,752 --> 00:39:15,990
If any of those crackers mess
with me, I'm missing them up.

833
00:39:16,023 --> 00:39:17,868
-Well, you can't go in there
with that kind of attitude.

834
00:39:17,892 --> 00:39:19,660
-To hell with that.

835
00:39:19,694 --> 00:39:21,896
I don't wanna go to
their damn school.

836
00:39:21,929 --> 00:39:23,631
I don't.

837
00:39:23,664 --> 00:39:25,666
[dog barking in distance]

838
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:27,902
I'm perfect right here.

839
00:39:27,935 --> 00:39:30,403
But no, they want a bunch
of kids who hate each other

840
00:39:30,437 --> 00:39:33,774
to walk hand in hand
and sing Kumbaya.

841
00:39:33,808 --> 00:39:35,475
Politicians are dumb.

842
00:39:35,509 --> 00:39:37,845
-I don't want to go
either, my dad's making me.

843
00:39:37,879 --> 00:39:40,014
But I'm not gonna go
with the attitude of

844
00:39:40,047 --> 00:39:44,619
a Black Panther or Malcolm X,
but a little Martin Luther King.

845
00:39:44,652 --> 00:39:46,687
-Psh. Shut up.

846
00:39:46,721 --> 00:39:48,089
And where's King?

847
00:39:48,122 --> 00:39:49,824
Dead.

848
00:39:49,857 --> 00:39:51,424
Murdered by a cracker.

849
00:39:51,458 --> 00:39:53,828
-Don't tell me to shut up!

850
00:39:53,861 --> 00:39:55,997
And Malcolm was
murdered by a Black man.

851
00:39:56,030 --> 00:39:58,165
Now is one murder less
serious than the other

852
00:39:58,199 --> 00:40:01,769
because of the color of
the person who did it?

853
00:40:01,802 --> 00:40:02,880
-You're always tryin'
to find the good

854
00:40:02,904 --> 00:40:03,904
in something bad.

855
00:40:05,472 --> 00:40:06,512
But ain't no good in this.

856
00:40:10,811 --> 00:40:12,189
I'm messing me up a white
boy if they screw with me!

857
00:40:12,213 --> 00:40:14,515
That's all.

858
00:40:14,548 --> 00:40:16,584
-If you go into that
school looking for trouble,

859
00:40:16,617 --> 00:40:17,652
you're gonna find it.

860
00:40:20,721 --> 00:40:21,721
-It found me.

861
00:40:23,791 --> 00:40:25,458
I'm just getting
ready for a war.

862
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:32,133

[boat blaring]

865
00:40:39,674 --> 00:40:41,642
-So.

866
00:40:41,676 --> 00:40:43,044
You and Marty.

867
00:40:43,077 --> 00:40:44,578
-Me and Marty.

868
00:40:44,612 --> 00:40:45,880
-You got nothin', right?

869
00:40:45,913 --> 00:40:46,847
I mean, he didn't ask you
to go steady or anything?

870
00:40:46,881 --> 00:40:48,616
-No. He's too scared.

871
00:40:50,885 --> 00:40:52,485
-Oh, okay.

872
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:55,790
Well, from this point on,
you're John Bunkley's girl.

873
00:40:55,823 --> 00:40:58,693
I'll make sure and
tell Marty that.

874
00:40:58,726 --> 00:41:02,630
-I'll tell him but I
didn't say yes to you yet.

875
00:41:02,663 --> 00:41:03,764
Did you think about that?

876
00:41:03,798 --> 00:41:07,034
-What, I couldn't hear you.
Say it a little louder.

877
00:41:07,068 --> 00:41:09,503
-I didn't say yes to you.

878
00:41:09,537 --> 00:41:10,537
-Well.

879
00:41:21,916 --> 00:41:24,618
[boat blaring]

880
00:41:24,652 --> 00:41:27,722
[birds squawking]

881
00:41:35,129 --> 00:41:38,299
-My father's gonna kill
us when he finds out.

882
00:41:38,332 --> 00:41:40,534
-Hey, don't worry
about your father.

883
00:41:41,602 --> 00:41:43,838
Okay?

884
00:41:43,871 --> 00:41:46,607
He and my old man,
they go way back.

885
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,542
They'll figure it out.

886
00:41:48,576 --> 00:41:51,979
If not, we'll run away

887
00:41:52,013 --> 00:41:55,116
and, uh, we'll be the
new Bonnie and Clyde.

888
00:41:55,149 --> 00:41:58,819
-Bonnie and Clyde. Robbing
banks and armored cars.

889
00:42:01,288 --> 00:42:03,024
-Can I tell you something?

890
00:42:03,057 --> 00:42:03,991
-Tell me something.

891
00:42:04,025 --> 00:42:06,927
[boat blaring]

892
00:42:06,961 --> 00:42:08,896
-You want to know why my
old man went to prison?

893
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,244
Everybody thinks it's
because he killed that coon

894
00:42:14,268 --> 00:42:16,771
for Mister McLaughlin,

895
00:42:16,804 --> 00:42:19,774
which I guess that is kind of
true, but what nobody knows

896
00:42:19,807 --> 00:42:22,176
is that the coon my
old man killed, he...

897
00:42:22,209 --> 00:42:23,320
-You don't have to
tell me this, John.

898
00:42:23,344 --> 00:42:25,846
I, um... it's all right.

899
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:27,948
-Just listen to me.
I'm gonna tell you.

900
00:42:27,982 --> 00:42:31,919
Um, the coon my old man killed,
he ran away with my mom.

901
00:42:36,624 --> 00:42:40,628
Yeah, the spade used to sell
dope for Mister McLaughlin.

902
00:42:40,661 --> 00:42:42,172
My old man would
collect money from him

903
00:42:42,196 --> 00:42:46,067
and my mom would just
go with him sometimes.

904
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:47,868
One day, my old
man went to collect

905
00:42:47,902 --> 00:42:49,980
and the coon and my mom were
stoned out of their minds

906
00:42:50,004 --> 00:42:53,374
and half naked,
just laying there.

907
00:42:53,407 --> 00:42:57,144
So my old man lost it and
beat that coon to death.

908
00:42:57,178 --> 00:42:59,180
And my ma ran away.

909
00:43:01,882 --> 00:43:02,882
I'm sorry.

910
00:43:06,053 --> 00:43:07,121
I brought you something.

911
00:43:09,156 --> 00:43:10,156
I brought, uh.

912
00:43:11,992 --> 00:43:13,094
This picture.

913
00:43:15,663 --> 00:43:19,066
[chuckles] so you
can meet my mom.

914
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:21,068
How I remember her, at least.

915
00:43:25,172 --> 00:43:28,109
[♪♪♪]

916
00:43:28,142 --> 00:43:29,677
When my old man told
me what happened,

917
00:43:29,710 --> 00:43:32,713
he made me promise
not to tell anyone.

918
00:43:32,746 --> 00:43:35,182
So you're the only one
that knows the whole story.

919
00:43:35,216 --> 00:43:37,151
-I'm not gonna tell
anyone the whole story.

920
00:43:38,986 --> 00:43:41,155
-I want you to keep
that picture, too.

921
00:43:41,188 --> 00:43:42,389
-John, you sure?

922
00:43:42,423 --> 00:43:44,091
-Mm-hm.

923
00:43:44,125 --> 00:43:45,960
You'll always have
my family with you.

924
00:43:45,993 --> 00:43:49,196
[birds squawking]

925
00:43:52,099 --> 00:43:53,099
-Okay.

926
00:43:54,335 --> 00:43:55,736
-Hey.

927
00:43:55,769 --> 00:43:56,871
-Hi, Marty. What's up?

928
00:43:56,904 --> 00:43:58,172
-What's up?

929
00:43:58,205 --> 00:44:00,040
Where's Kate?

930
00:44:00,074 --> 00:44:01,075
-Ah, she took a walk.

931
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:03,944
-Without you?

932
00:44:03,978 --> 00:44:05,098
-Yeah, she'll be right back.

933
00:44:09,450 --> 00:44:11,018
Marty, let's talk.

934
00:44:11,051 --> 00:44:12,853
Hey.

935
00:44:12,887 --> 00:44:15,222
-You know something, don't you?

936
00:44:15,256 --> 00:44:16,867
-Why didn't you ask
Kate to go out with you?

937
00:44:16,891 --> 00:44:19,059
-Why do you think I
got this sweat box on?

938
00:44:19,093 --> 00:44:22,263
That was my plan today. I
was gonna give her my jacket.

939
00:44:22,296 --> 00:44:23,697
[scoffs] What's the matter?

940
00:44:25,266 --> 00:44:26,867
-Marty, she's going
out with John now.

941
00:44:30,804 --> 00:44:32,106
-Is she with him now?

942
00:44:32,139 --> 00:44:33,139
-Yeah.

943
00:44:35,109 --> 00:44:36,177
-They know?

944
00:44:36,210 --> 00:44:37,411
-Them? Yeah.

945
00:44:37,444 --> 00:44:40,080
[birds chirping]

946
00:44:40,114 --> 00:44:41,715
[Marty exhales]

947
00:44:41,749 --> 00:44:42,716
-Marty, come on.
Where you going?

948
00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:43,750
-Going for a walk.

949
00:44:45,085 --> 00:44:48,756
[approaching footsteps]

950
00:44:48,789 --> 00:44:50,925
-Hey, um, you know what?
Just let me talk to him.

951
00:44:50,958 --> 00:44:53,961
I don't want to cause
any problems or anything.

952
00:44:53,994 --> 00:44:55,129
-All right, go ahead.

953
00:44:55,162 --> 00:44:57,174
But if he talks any shit, I'm
gonna punch him in the face.

954
00:44:57,198 --> 00:44:58,198
-[Kate shushes]

955
00:45:00,834 --> 00:45:01,834
Hey.

956
00:45:02,903 --> 00:45:04,104
-That's all you can say?

957
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:08,943
-No. I could...
I could say more.

958
00:45:08,976 --> 00:45:09,976
I just.

959
00:45:12,313 --> 00:45:14,448
I don't know what to say.

960
00:45:14,481 --> 00:45:15,493
-Well, how about, all
the rumors are lies

961
00:45:15,517 --> 00:45:17,117
and I want to be with you.

962
00:45:17,151 --> 00:45:19,153
[birds chirping]

963
00:45:19,186 --> 00:45:20,187
-Um.

964
00:45:25,059 --> 00:45:26,026
Well, I'm sorry, Marty.

965
00:45:26,060 --> 00:45:28,195
I can't say that.

966
00:45:28,229 --> 00:45:29,930
-Fuck, Kate! What's
gotten into you?

967
00:45:29,964 --> 00:45:31,341
-Hey, Marty, you better
watch ya fucking mouth!

968
00:45:31,365 --> 00:45:33,434
-John, stop it! I think
you should leave, Marty.

969
00:45:33,467 --> 00:45:35,002
-W-why? Because of him?

970
00:45:35,035 --> 00:45:36,313
I don't have to go nowhere.
I'm not afraid of him.

971
00:45:36,337 --> 00:45:37,404
-Shut the fuck up, Marty!

972
00:45:37,438 --> 00:45:38,906

-Marty! Marty!

976
00:45:45,179 --> 00:45:46,146
That's enough!

977
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:49,016
-Get off me! Ah!

978
00:45:49,049 --> 00:45:50,851
- Get off him, John!
- John!

979
00:45:54,421 --> 00:45:55,421
-John!

980
00:45:57,458 --> 00:45:59,093
-Are you okay? Are you okay?

981
00:45:59,126 --> 00:46:00,060
Did I hurt you? Are you okay?

982
00:46:00,094 --> 00:46:02,129
Are you okay?
- [Kate trembling]

983
00:46:02,162 --> 00:46:04,532
-It's fine, Marty.
Are you okay?

984
00:46:04,566 --> 00:46:06,100
It's okay. So breathe.

985
00:46:06,133 --> 00:46:07,434
It's okay.

986
00:46:07,468 --> 00:46:08,469
Kate, are you all right?

987
00:46:08,503 --> 00:46:10,804
-Are you okay? Did I hurt you?

988
00:46:10,838 --> 00:46:12,306
I'm sorry. I didn't
mean to hurt you.

-John, you can't
push her like that.

992
00:46:19,013 --> 00:46:20,253
What the hell's wrong with you?

00:46:22,883 --> 00:46:24,318
- [door opens]
- [door chime rings]

994
00:46:24,351 --> 00:46:26,053
-Hey, Coughlin. Usual?

995
00:46:26,086 --> 00:46:27,154
-Yeah.

996
00:46:27,187 --> 00:46:28,322
-And you, Riley?

997
00:46:28,355 --> 00:46:29,390
-Pastrami.

998
00:46:31,158 --> 00:46:32,826
When you retiring, Spanelli?

999
00:46:32,860 --> 00:46:34,562
-[chuckles] No time soon.

1000
00:46:34,596 --> 00:46:36,330
Still a lot of life
in this ticker.

1001
00:46:36,363 --> 00:46:38,232
-My momma said if a
cracker calls me a name,

1002
00:46:38,265 --> 00:46:39,233
punch him in the face.

1003
00:46:39,266 --> 00:46:41,135
-I said don't say that.

1004
00:46:41,168 --> 00:46:42,970
The police will be
there to protect you.

1005
00:46:43,003 --> 00:46:44,405
-Do you hear her?

1006
00:46:44,438 --> 00:46:46,240
You can't force people
to like each other.

1007
00:46:46,273 --> 00:46:48,075
You got to gradually
move 'em along.

1008
00:46:48,108 --> 00:46:49,243
-Too bad you ain't mayor.

1009
00:46:49,276 --> 00:46:51,111
-Yeah. That's what I say.

1010
00:46:51,145 --> 00:46:53,180
-My momma said don't
trust the pigs.

1011
00:47:02,557 --> 00:47:10,557
-I, uh, just want to let
you know that we're...

1012
00:47:11,365 --> 00:47:12,543
We're gonna do
everything in our power

1013

to make sure that you
get a safe education.

1014
00:47:16,170 --> 00:47:18,906
-Can I ask you a question?

1015
00:47:18,939 --> 00:47:19,939
-Go ahead.

1016
00:47:21,643 --> 00:47:24,478
Why do white people
hate us so much?

1017
00:47:27,915 --> 00:47:28,650
-No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1018
00:47:28,683 --> 00:47:32,086
I don't... I don't hate you.

1019
00:47:32,119 --> 00:47:33,463
And I know a lot of white
people who are like me.

1020
00:47:33,487 --> 00:47:36,290

He's nice, right?

-Old? Watch your mouth, kid.

1025
00:47:57,712 --> 00:47:58,680
Where you been?

00:48:00,214 --> 00:48:01,482
-Went to the park.

1028

-Oh yeah?

1029
00:48:03,083 --> 00:48:05,653
-Yeah. I had to beat
this motherfucker's ass.

1030
00:48:05,687 --> 00:48:08,155
-You better have beaten his ass.

-Is it about that Coughlin girl?

1037
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:27,440
You need some tips?

1038
00:48:29,309 --> 00:48:31,345
-It's about Ma.

1039
00:48:31,378 --> 00:48:33,347
-What're you
bringing her up for?

1040
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:35,540
What, your grandma and me,
we didn't do enough for you?

I know what the fuck it is.

1045

The Coughlin girl's
making you weak.

1046
00:48:43,758 --> 00:48:45,292
Let me give you some...

1047
00:48:45,325 --> 00:48:46,670
Hey, let me give you some
fucking advice about women.

1048
00:48:46,694 --> 00:48:48,962
They ain't to be trusted.
They're all whores.

1049
00:48:48,996 --> 00:48:51,064
And your mother, who
you're so concerned about,

1050
00:48:51,098 --> 00:48:52,700
left you for a fucking nigga.

1051
00:48:54,468 --> 00:48:55,469
Let that sink in.

1052
00:48:58,573 --> 00:49:01,643
-[sighs deeply] I didn't
mean it like that.

-Yeah, how'd you mean it?

1054

-I was just wondering.

1055
00:49:05,647 --> 00:49:08,516
You know, I mean, you think
she might be dead or something?

1056

What you looking at

00:49:25,667 --> 00:49:27,635
What, you think I killed her?

-Did you?

1060
00:49:29,203 --> 00:49:31,083
-Well, if I did, she got
what was coming to her.

1061

Get the fuck out of my face.
Get the fuck out of here!

1062
00:49:42,750 --> 00:49:44,586
Go back to your

You gonna clean up

-Always with the yard, Ma.

When your old man was beating
my brains in, where was you?

In the yard with them
stupid fucking roses.

1073
00:50:08,843 --> 00:50:11,646
-I couldn't fight your father,

1074
00:50:11,679 --> 00:50:13,648
so I prayed.

about your prayers, Ma.

Yeah. That much we know.

1079
00:50:21,823 --> 00:50:23,123
-That's not true.

1080
00:50:25,693 --> 00:50:28,663
I prayed you got out
of the joint early.

1081

Well, here you are.

1082
00:50:34,401 --> 00:50:40,374
I pray for you every
day, 'cause you're

1083

Where's Kate?

1090
00:50:57,859 --> 00:50:59,192
-In her room.

1091
00:50:59,226 --> 00:51:00,226
-What's her mood?

1092
00:51:01,863 --> 00:51:05,432
-She came home from the park
smiling from ear to ear.

1093
00:51:05,465 --> 00:51:07,200
-Yeah. You sure she
was at the park?

1094

-We have to trust her.

1095
00:51:08,570 --> 00:51:10,490
-Not after the other night.
She has to earn that.

You said she was
smiling. About?

1099

-I think Marty asked her to
the prom and to go steady.

1100
00:51:31,491 --> 00:51:34,261
She was in a special place.

1101
00:51:34,294 --> 00:51:35,530
-Did she tell you that?

1102
00:51:35,563 --> 00:51:38,332
-No. But a mother can tell.

1103
00:51:42,369 --> 00:51:44,471

than the Bunkley kid.

I'm gonna talk with her.

1106

I'm gonna give her
my approval. Okay?

What's that for?

1110

-For being a great
mother and a great wife.

1111
00:52:21,876 --> 00:52:27,381
Without you, well, I don't
know. I'd be a different man.

Pat! Kate's not here!

1119
00:52:47,902 --> 00:52:49,671
-What do you mean?
She went upstairs.

1120
00:52:49,704 --> 00:52:51,839
-She better not be
where I think she is.

1121

You call Cheryl's house.
I'll check the park,

1232
00:58:33,014 --> 00:58:34,548
-Calm down.

1233
00:58:34,582 --> 00:58:35,516
-What do you think we are?

1234
00:58:35,549 --> 00:58:37,618
A bunch of fucking tree
jumpers? Look around!

1235
00:58:37,651 --> 00:58:39,120
Is this a place
for a teenage girl?

1236
00:58:39,153 --> 00:58:40,921
-Okay, you're
right. I apologize.

1237
00:58:40,955 --> 00:58:42,656
-Yeah, you damn right I'm right.

1238
00:58:42,690 --> 00:58:44,258
We got a bunch of
morals and codes

1239
00:58:44,291 --> 00:58:46,127
that we don't fucking break.

1240
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:47,828
Don't disrespect
us like that again.

1241
00:58:47,862 --> 00:58:49,563
One more time, and
like that fucking ball

1242
00:58:49,597 --> 00:58:50,598
-Ooh.

1243
00:58:50,631 --> 00:58:51,699
-I just swung at,

1244
00:58:51,732 --> 00:58:53,067
you won't fucking exist.

1245
00:58:53,100 --> 00:58:54,902
-Hey, hold on. Hold on.

1246
00:58:54,935 --> 00:58:57,738
If Kate's missing,
maybe we can help.

1247
00:58:57,772 --> 00:58:59,073
-I don't need your kind of help.

1248
00:58:59,106 --> 00:59:00,808
-Oh, be nice, Billy.

1249
00:59:00,841 --> 00:59:01,841
- Yeah.
- [phone ringing]

1250
00:59:03,744 --> 00:59:05,846
-[into phone] Yeah? Yeah, sure.

1251
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:08,215
Billy, you got a call.

1252
00:59:08,249 --> 00:59:09,249
-Here we go.

1253
00:59:12,319 --> 00:59:13,888
-We work for you now apparently.

1254
00:59:17,058 --> 00:59:18,058
-There you go.

1255
00:59:20,294 --> 00:59:23,264
-[into phone] Hello. Yeah.

1256
00:59:23,297 --> 00:59:24,297
Okay.

1257
00:59:25,866 --> 00:59:27,068
[phone thuds]

1258
00:59:30,237 --> 00:59:31,939
Kate's home.

1259
00:59:31,972 --> 00:59:34,708
-Uh, Billy, then.

1260
00:59:34,742 --> 00:59:39,847
-Billy, don't you ever come
in here like that again.

1261
00:59:47,388 --> 00:59:49,356
-[laughs] Nice job.

1262
00:59:49,390 --> 00:59:52,193
[door opens then closes]

1263
00:59:53,661 --> 00:59:54,838
-When did you start
sneaking out of the house?

1264
00:59:54,862 --> 00:59:57,698
-Mom, I just wanted
to go and hang out...

1265
00:59:57,731 --> 01:00:00,768
-Marty? He asked to
go steady, didn't he?

1266
01:00:03,404 --> 01:00:04,705
-Yeah.

1267
01:00:04,738 --> 01:00:06,974
-[Pat chuckles]

1268
01:00:07,007 --> 01:00:08,809
-Marty.

1269
01:00:08,843 --> 01:00:13,147
I just. I didn't know how
you guys were gonna react.

1270
01:00:13,180 --> 01:00:15,149
-Yes, I knew it.

1271
01:00:15,182 --> 01:00:16,884
You know how relieved
your Dad is gonna be

1272
01:00:16,917 --> 01:00:17,852
when he finds out
-[Kate chuckles]

1273
01:00:17,885 --> 01:00:19,019
that you're dating Marty?

1274
01:00:21,822 --> 01:00:23,324
When you came in
the house earlier,

1275
01:00:23,357 --> 01:00:25,893
I knew something special
happened in your life.

1276
01:00:25,926 --> 01:00:26,926
-Really? How?

1277
01:00:28,262 --> 01:00:32,800
-Your smile, and a
mother's intuition.

1278
01:00:32,833 --> 01:00:34,235
We just know these things.

1279
01:00:34,268 --> 01:00:36,904
-Yeah.

1280
01:00:36,937 --> 01:00:39,006
-I told your dad.

1281
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:43,210
-Oh. What did he say?

1282
01:00:43,244 --> 01:00:45,212
-Marty is a good kid.

1283
01:00:45,246 --> 01:00:47,882
-Kate, you better
have an explanation!

1284
01:00:47,915 --> 01:00:49,350
-Calm down.

1285
01:00:49,383 --> 01:00:50,961
-Why is everyone telling me
to calm down all the time?

1286
01:00:50,985 --> 01:00:53,754
I'm calm. Where was she?

1287
01:00:55,389 --> 01:00:56,323
Huh?

1288
01:00:56,357 --> 01:00:59,059
-She sneaked out to go
hang out with Marty.

1289
01:00:59,093 --> 01:01:01,829
-Is that true?

1290
01:01:01,862 --> 01:01:02,930
-Yeah.

1291
01:01:02,963 --> 01:01:04,007
-You weren't with
the Bunkley kid?

1292
01:01:04,031 --> 01:01:05,242
- No!!
- You better not be lying!

1293
01:01:05,266 --> 01:01:07,001
-I'm not... I'm
not lying to you!

1294
01:01:07,034 --> 01:01:08,903
-Okay.

1295
01:01:08,936 --> 01:01:11,176
But I don't like the idea of
not knowing where you're at.

1296
01:01:11,205 --> 01:01:12,983
So next time, I don't give
a damn who you're with,

1297
01:01:13,007 --> 01:01:14,108
just let us know.

1298
01:01:14,141 --> 01:01:15,209
- All right.
- Am I clear?

1299
01:01:15,242 --> 01:01:16,343
-Yeah. Not a problem.

1300
01:01:18,245 --> 01:01:19,780
Can I go to my room now?

1301
01:01:19,813 --> 01:01:20,814
-Go ahead.

1302
01:01:22,249 --> 01:01:23,249
[footsteps receding]

1303
01:01:28,489 --> 01:01:29,489
[door slams]

1304
01:01:32,092 --> 01:01:34,361
-That girl is gonna drive
me to an early grave.

1305
01:01:37,932 --> 01:01:40,367
-I used to sneak out of
the house to meet you.

1306
01:01:40,401 --> 01:01:43,337
[soft music]

1307
01:02:03,290 --> 01:02:04,358
[birds chirping]

1308
01:02:04,391 --> 01:02:06,160
[fridge door closes]

1309
01:02:06,193 --> 01:02:08,162
So, what's on the agenda?

1310
01:02:09,263 --> 01:02:11,465
-Play catch.

1311
01:02:11,498 --> 01:02:15,936
And have the birds and
the bees talk with Dad.

1312
01:02:15,970 --> 01:02:18,138
-I'll let your mom tell
you all about the birds.

1313
01:02:18,172 --> 01:02:21,041
I'm gonna teach you about
the bees. They sting.

1314
01:02:21,075 --> 01:02:22,075
Get your glove.

1315
01:02:25,580 --> 01:02:26,580
Nice.

1316
01:02:29,083 --> 01:02:30,251
Oh, kid. Come on.

1317
01:02:30,284 --> 01:02:31,318
-Relax.

1318
01:02:31,352 --> 01:02:32,419
-Tell me about Marty.

1319
01:02:34,955 --> 01:02:37,224
-What do you mean,
tell me about Marty?

1320
01:02:37,258 --> 01:02:38,459
-Oops, strong arm.

1321
01:02:41,962 --> 01:02:42,997
Why you like him?

1322
01:02:43,030 --> 01:02:44,265
[birds chirping]

1323
01:02:45,966 --> 01:02:47,167
Hey.

1324
01:02:47,201 --> 01:02:48,201
Ball.

1325
01:02:53,307 --> 01:02:54,509
You gonna answer me?

1326
01:02:57,244 --> 01:02:58,379
-He reminds me of you.

1327
01:03:00,314 --> 01:03:02,349
-How you figure?

1328
01:03:02,383 --> 01:03:03,551
That kid is nothing like me.

1329
01:03:08,623 --> 01:03:09,591
I think he's a little soft.

1330
01:03:09,624 --> 01:03:11,526
You know, I'm not... I
was never a soft guy.

1331
01:03:13,961 --> 01:03:15,396
Which is why I like him for you.

1332
01:03:15,429 --> 01:03:17,197
You know, guys like that
don't have the sting

1333
01:03:17,231 --> 01:03:18,391
but they still get the honey.

1334
01:03:21,101 --> 01:03:22,101
You get my drift?

1335
01:03:25,072 --> 01:03:26,140
What's with that look?

1336
01:03:30,344 --> 01:03:31,412
-No, you're right.

1337
01:03:33,147 --> 01:03:34,448
Marty ain't nothing like you.

1338
01:03:40,154 --> 01:03:41,255
[locker door closes]

1339
01:03:45,492 --> 01:03:47,928
-How was it, workin' the jungle?

1340
01:03:50,598 --> 01:03:52,299
Hey, new guy. Talkin' to you.

1341
01:03:52,333 --> 01:03:56,337
-The name is Officer Coughlin.

1342
01:03:56,370 --> 01:03:58,939
-Okay, Officer Coughlin.

1343
01:03:58,972 --> 01:04:01,041
Don't bite my head off.

1344
01:04:01,075 --> 01:04:04,144
We're on the same team here.

1345
01:04:04,178 --> 01:04:08,349
I was askin', how was
workin' in the jungle?

1346
01:04:08,382 --> 01:04:10,552
-What are you talking about?

1347
01:04:10,585 --> 01:04:12,319
-Roxbury.

1348
01:04:12,353 --> 01:04:17,324
You know, land of the.
[clicking tongue] Negroes.

1349
01:04:19,259 --> 01:04:20,259
[locker closes]

1350
01:04:21,295 --> 01:04:23,197
[Bill sighs]

1351
01:04:27,401 --> 01:04:29,571
-It's like anywhere.

1352
01:04:29,604 --> 01:04:32,039
It has its ups and downs.

1353
01:04:32,072 --> 01:04:34,208
-Anyway, we decided
not to come in to work

1354
01:04:34,241 --> 01:04:35,543
on the first day of school.

1355
01:04:35,577 --> 01:04:37,144
-What about the kids?

1356
01:04:37,177 --> 01:04:39,547
-What, the spades? Fuck 'em!

1357
01:04:39,581 --> 01:04:41,382
-That's fucked up.

1358
01:04:41,415 --> 01:04:43,050
We swore an oath to
serve and protect,

1359
01:04:43,083 --> 01:04:44,552
and you cocksuckers
want to back out

1360
01:04:44,586 --> 01:04:46,120
now that the goin' gets tough?

1361
01:04:46,153 --> 01:04:48,055
-Hey, you don't fuckin'
talk to me like that!

1362
01:04:48,088 --> 01:04:50,424
You don't know me and I don't
think you wanna find out.

1363
01:04:50,457 --> 01:04:52,259
-Listen to me carefully.

1364
01:04:52,292 --> 01:04:54,094
My little girl is
going to school

1365
01:04:54,128 --> 01:04:56,263
and I'll be there to
protect her or anyone else

1366
01:04:56,296 --> 01:04:58,232
who needs my assistance,
so if you assholes

1367
01:04:58,265 --> 01:05:00,000
wanna keep your
asshole kids at home,

1368
01:05:02,604 --> 01:05:03,638
that's your choice.

1369
01:05:09,209 --> 01:05:10,277
[train honking]

1370

[gun cocks]

1373
01:05:25,359 --> 01:05:26,326
I'm a Boston police officer!

1374
01:05:26,360 --> 01:05:28,095
[car door closes]

1375
01:05:28,128 --> 01:05:30,097
Don't take another step.

1376
01:05:32,299 --> 01:05:34,636
-Billy, it's me.
Put the gun down.

1377
01:05:34,669 --> 01:05:37,371
-McLaughlin! What
the fuck, man?

1378
01:05:37,404 --> 01:05:39,707
Why you following me? I
coulda blown your brains out.

1379
01:05:39,741 --> 01:05:42,176
-[chuckles] Look, I knew
you wouldn't kill me.

1380
01:05:42,209 --> 01:05:44,344
I mean, you haven't
got it in you.

1381
01:05:46,280 --> 01:05:49,483
-I came pretty close.
What do you want?

1382
01:05:51,719 --> 01:05:55,389
-Uh, I hear you're
not cooperating.

1383
01:05:57,424 --> 01:06:00,562
It's this busing thing
that's driving me crazy.

1384
01:06:00,595 --> 01:06:03,063
I-I-I can't sleep. I
don't know how you can.

1385
01:06:04,566 --> 01:06:06,300
-Easy. I just close my eyes.

1386
01:06:09,436 --> 01:06:11,271
-[McLaughlin sighs]

1387
01:06:11,305 --> 01:06:15,008
Look, you and me,

1388
01:06:15,042 --> 01:06:16,109
we go way back.

1389
01:06:17,244 --> 01:06:19,714
I remember you like this.

1390
01:06:19,747 --> 01:06:23,651
Snot pouring out of your nose,
running around in your diapers.

1391
01:06:23,685 --> 01:06:26,019
We're family.

1392
01:06:26,053 --> 01:06:28,388
I protect my family
no matter what,

1393
01:06:28,422 --> 01:06:31,091
and I expect you to do the same.

1394
01:06:32,594 --> 01:06:36,230
Now your fellow officers have
asked you to band with them,

1395
01:06:36,263 --> 01:06:40,768
to protest this injustice,
this... this attack

1396
01:06:40,802 --> 01:06:44,539
on our neighborhood
and our way of life.

1397
01:06:44,572 --> 01:06:48,242
By these people that...
they're not like us.

1398
01:06:48,275 --> 01:06:50,410
They're just not like us.

1399
01:06:50,444 --> 01:06:51,655
You know, these
animals, they're...

1400
01:06:51,679 --> 01:06:53,480
They wanna destroy
our neighborhood.

1401
01:06:53,515 --> 01:06:55,148
Don't you get it?

1402
01:06:55,182 --> 01:06:58,820
Our neighborhood that
took generations to build,

1403
01:06:58,853 --> 01:07:02,790
that's what I'm talking about.

1404
01:07:02,824 --> 01:07:05,492
It means something.

01:17:20,407 --> 01:17:22,076
-Stop.

1580
01:17:22,109 --> 01:17:25,779
Stop being so
critical of yourself.

1581
01:17:25,813 --> 01:17:29,083
It's not easy.

1582
01:17:29,116 --> 01:17:33,687
You know, we live on this
planet with all kinds of people,

1583
01:17:33,721 --> 01:17:35,856
some good and some bad.

1584
01:17:37,391 --> 01:17:39,026
You can't fix them all.

1585
01:17:42,830 --> 01:17:47,268
All you can do is make sure
our daughter turns out like us

1586
01:17:47,301 --> 01:17:48,435
and not them.

1587
01:17:48,469 --> 01:17:51,238
-Yeah. Okay.

1588
01:18:05,819 --> 01:18:07,922
Where you going?

1589
01:18:07,955 --> 01:18:09,823
-I almost forgot.

[dresser door opens then closes]

1591
01:18:14,395 --> 01:18:16,830
We have a problem.

1592
01:18:16,864 --> 01:18:18,866
-What?

1593
01:18:18,899 --> 01:18:20,502
Where'd you find this?

1594
01:18:20,535 --> 01:18:23,170
-In Kate's room.

1595
01:18:23,204 --> 01:18:25,239
-What the fuck?
Where'd she get this?

1596
01:18:25,272 --> 01:18:27,509
-Stop cursing! I don't know.

1597
01:18:27,542 --> 01:18:30,044
-[yells] Kate!

1598
01:18:30,077 --> 01:18:31,077
Come here, you.

1599

[door opens]

1600
01:18:35,883 --> 01:18:37,818
Kate? Huh?

1601
01:18:38,919 --> 01:18:40,321
Where'd you get this?

1602
01:18:40,354 --> 01:18:42,189
Huh?

1603
01:18:42,223 --> 01:18:43,223
Answer me.

1604
01:18:45,059 --> 01:18:47,261
-You know. You know already.

1605
01:18:47,294 --> 01:18:49,296
-We don't know, so tell us.

1606
01:18:51,065 --> 01:18:52,065
Now!

1607
01:18:54,134 --> 01:18:55,369
-John gave it to me.

1608
01:18:56,870 --> 01:18:58,348
-Why'd I tell you to
stay away from that kid?

1609
01:18:58,372 --> 01:19:00,274
You think I said that
to be an asshole?

1610
01:19:03,244 --> 01:19:04,245
Look at it.

1611
01:19:04,278 --> 01:19:05,278
-[cries] No.

1612
01:19:09,016 --> 01:19:10,117
-Look at it.

1613
01:19:10,150 --> 01:19:11,150
Look at it.

1614
01:19:12,853 --> 01:19:14,355
Look at it very carefully.

1615
01:19:14,388 --> 01:19:16,056
-Mm-hm.

1616
01:19:16,090 --> 01:19:18,092
-Look at John's mother's face.

1617
01:19:20,461 --> 01:19:21,461
What do you see?

1618
01:19:23,330 --> 01:19:26,133
-She looks.

1619
01:19:26,166 --> 01:19:27,535
Scared.

1620
01:19:27,569 --> 01:19:28,936
-Yeah, she looks scared.

1621
01:19:31,305 --> 01:19:32,339
I took that picture.

1622
01:19:36,443 --> 01:19:38,412
Johnny beat the hell out
of Brenda the day before.

1623

-[Kate sniffles]

1624
01:19:40,447 --> 01:19:41,447
-You wanna know why?

1625
01:19:43,518 --> 01:19:45,061
Because she took too
long talking to the guy

1626
01:19:45,085 --> 01:19:46,085
at the grocery store.

1627
01:19:48,222 --> 01:19:51,559
I had to drag him off of her.

1628

[scoffs]

1629
01:19:56,430 --> 01:19:58,866
-So John is who
you're really dating?

1630
01:20:00,968 --> 01:20:03,137
-For Christ's sake,
you've been lying to us.

1631
01:20:03,170 --> 01:20:05,507
Why? Huh? Why you lying to us?

1632
01:20:05,540 --> 01:20:07,007
-What's gotten into you?

1633
01:20:07,041 --> 01:20:07,975
-He's not like his father,

1634
01:20:08,008 --> 01:20:10,044
and I knew you would
never approve of him.

1635
01:20:10,077 --> 01:20:11,187
I knew you would
never approve of him.

1636
01:20:11,211 --> 01:20:12,590
-Let me tell you something.
Let me tell you something

1637
01:20:12,614 --> 01:20:14,481
about Johnny Bunkley,
okay? He's vicious.

1638
01:20:14,516 --> 01:20:17,084
I believe he killed
John's mother.

1639
01:20:17,117 --> 01:20:18,285
-You never told me that.

1640
01:20:18,319 --> 01:20:20,588
-Because I had no proof, okay?

1641
01:20:20,622 --> 01:20:22,624
And some things are not
meant to be talked about

1642
01:20:22,657 --> 01:20:25,259
till crap like this comes
up and secrets come out.

1643
01:20:25,292 --> 01:20:26,628
-Okay, did you
ever think of this?

1644
01:20:26,661 --> 01:20:28,996
Did you ever think that
maybe she deserved it

1645
01:20:29,029 --> 01:20:30,497
for sleeping with a coon?

1646

[slap thrown]

1647
01:20:31,633 --> 01:20:33,601
-Don't use that
language in my house!

1648
01:20:33,635 --> 01:20:36,370
And how dare you say anyone
deserves to be killed?

1649
01:20:36,403 --> 01:20:37,871
What have you turned into?

1650
01:20:37,905 --> 01:20:39,440
-Okay, this has
gotten out of hand.

1651
01:20:39,473 --> 01:20:41,041
She's not going
to school tomorrow

1652
01:20:41,075 --> 01:20:43,310
till I talk to that
kid. You hear me?

1653
01:20:43,344 --> 01:20:46,080
Stay here. Don't you
leave this house.

1655

-And don't you ever
use that word again.

01:20:51,653 --> 01:20:54,522
-Thank you. Thank
you, Mom and Dad,

1657
01:20:54,556 --> 01:20:58,225
for the best senior year ever.

1658

But I'm disappointed
in your behavior.

-Not today.

I'm not on their side.

-I know. I'm
really sorry, Mom.

1726

-Can't judge people

You can't.

-Okay.

1731
01:25:11,946 --> 01:25:14,147
But to say someone
deserves to die,

1732
01:25:14,181 --> 01:25:16,283
that scares the hell out of me.

1733
01:25:16,316 --> 01:25:18,251

could utter those words.

say and I'm really sorry.

Daddy's not sure that
Johnny killed his wife.

-Kate, are you listening
to what you're saying?

1740
01:25:32,366 --> 01:25:35,435
The fact that we're even
discussing this is scary.

Shame on you for hanging
around people like that.

-I know it was wrong
to lie to you guys.

and I'm really sorry.

1745

But how is keeping me
home gonna fix anything?

1746
01:25:55,757 --> 01:25:56,867
We're just gonna look
like the other families,

1747
01:25:56,891 --> 01:25:57,825
keeping their kids home

1748
01:25:57,859 --> 01:25:59,268
because the Black kids
are gonna be there.

1749
01:25:59,292 --> 01:26:01,228
It's wrong.

1750
01:26:01,261 --> 01:26:02,261
Mom,

1751
01:26:04,565 --> 01:26:06,934
you and Daddy are gonna look
like racists when you're not.

1752
01:26:08,136 --> 01:26:10,705
And Daddy was just really mad
and you didn't think of that.

1753
01:26:15,543 --> 01:26:16,553
-Are you trying to con me?

Why did you have
to come to Southie?

1929
01:36:27,855 --> 01:36:30,357
Why couldn't you
just stay in Roxbury?

1930
01:36:33,060 --> 01:36:34,529
-I've seen you before.

1931
01:36:36,030 --> 01:36:37,030
-What?

1932
01:36:39,233 --> 01:36:40,535
No, I don't think so.

1933
01:36:40,568 --> 01:36:44,104
-Yeah, I have.

1934
01:36:44,138 --> 01:36:45,483
You were throwing
rocks at our car.

1935
01:36:45,507 --> 01:36:47,241
You tried to kill us.

1936
01:36:49,009 --> 01:36:51,245
You know, if your dad dies,

1937
01:36:51,278 --> 01:36:54,081
it's not because a
Black man shot him.

1938
01:36:54,114 --> 01:36:57,451
It's because people like
you who pulled the trigger.

1939
01:36:57,484 --> 01:36:59,486
Racist, hateful people...

1940
01:37:06,327 --> 01:37:09,597
-[Kate sobs]

1941
01:37:10,998 --> 01:37:14,368
I'm sorry. I'm
sorry. I'm sorry.

1942
01:37:14,401 --> 01:37:15,646
Mom, I should've
listened to you.

1943
01:37:15,670 --> 01:37:17,171
I'm sorry.

1944
01:37:17,204 --> 01:37:19,406
[cries]

1945
01:37:19,440 --> 01:37:21,108
I should have listened to you.

1946
01:37:22,376 --> 01:37:23,344
-It's gonna be okay.

1947
01:37:23,377 --> 01:37:25,580
-Oh, Dad. I'm sorry.

1948
01:37:25,613 --> 01:37:28,449
I'm sorry.

1949
01:37:28,482 --> 01:37:31,318
[sobbing]

1950
01:37:34,355 --> 01:37:36,423
-How is he?

1951
01:37:36,457 --> 01:37:37,858
-Uh, he's stable.

1952
01:37:42,396 --> 01:37:44,131
-Can we see him?

1953
01:37:44,164 --> 01:37:47,535
-Uh, yes, for a few minutes.

1954
01:37:47,569 --> 01:37:48,936
-Come on. Let's go see him.

1955
01:37:48,969 --> 01:37:51,872
[footsteps]

1956
01:37:58,212 --> 01:38:01,048
-Dad, she was one of the kids

1957
01:38:01,081 --> 01:38:02,650
who was throwing
rocks at our car.

1958
01:38:07,689 --> 01:38:10,124
-I did not see that coming.

1959
01:38:11,626 --> 01:38:13,460
I mean, with parents like that.

1960
01:38:18,666 --> 01:38:20,668
I don't even know how to feel.

1961
01:38:20,702 --> 01:38:23,070
-I'm angry.

1962
01:38:23,103 --> 01:38:26,407
Like you said, I don't
understand... her parents. I...

1963
01:38:30,678 --> 01:38:32,346
-You know, your
mother used to talk

1964
01:38:32,379 --> 01:38:35,683
to the neighborhood hoodlums.

1965
01:38:35,717 --> 01:38:36,684
And I'd always ask her,

1966
01:38:36,718 --> 01:38:39,353
"Why do you waste your
time talking to them?"

1967
01:38:39,386 --> 01:38:43,525
And she'd say that a bad act
doesn't make a bad person.

1968
01:38:45,627 --> 01:38:46,627
-Ma was special.

1969
01:38:50,164 --> 01:38:51,498
-Yeah, she was.

1970
01:38:53,167 --> 01:38:59,473
And she would be so very,
very proud of you today.

1971
01:38:59,507 --> 01:39:02,376
You put yourself in danger.

1972
01:39:02,409 --> 01:39:06,079
And I don't ever want
you to do that again.

1973
01:39:06,113 --> 01:39:12,486
But, my god, you reminded
me of her so much.

1974
01:39:12,520 --> 01:39:19,359
[sniffles] You're so brave
and I'm very proud of you.

1975
01:39:21,195 --> 01:39:22,496
-Thanks, Dad.

1976
01:39:22,530 --> 01:39:25,667
[cries]

1977
01:39:30,103 --> 01:39:34,141
[heart monitor beeping]

1978
01:39:34,174 --> 01:39:35,543
-[whispering] Bill.

1979
01:39:37,478 --> 01:39:41,081
If you can hear me,
you need to know.

1980
01:39:44,351 --> 01:39:46,353
You're a good man.

1981
01:39:50,825 --> 01:39:53,728
You're a very good man.

1982
01:39:56,430 --> 01:39:59,166
[heart monitor beeping]

1983
01:40:19,186 --> 01:40:22,189
-[Kate cries silently]

1984
01:40:22,222 --> 01:40:25,259
[heart monitor beeping]

1985
01:40:48,750 --> 01:40:51,686
[beeping echoes]
