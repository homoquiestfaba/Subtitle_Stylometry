00:07:41,291 --> 00:07:42,750
Okay, there's a goat head
in the hot tub.

189
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:45,000
This place smells like cow shit
and everybody hates me

190
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:46,416
and I'm getting married.

191
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,250
Fucking drink it.

192
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:47,875
BETTY:
We're all drinking.

193
00:07:47,958 --> 00:07:48,625
-Listen up.
-Yes!

194
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:49,750
Take a drink.
Don't set it down.

195
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:50,583
-Take a drink.
-Come on.

196
00:07:50,666 --> 00:07:51,125
Wooo!

197
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:51,958
Come on.

198
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:53,125
-Oh... Yes!
-Yes!

199
00:07:53,208 --> 00:07:54,458
Wooh!

200
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:55,000
CARMEN:
Yes!

201
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:56,791
The nerd is fucking drinking!

202
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:58,083
Now it's a party!

203
00:07:58,166 --> 00:07:59,291
Okay.

204
00:07:59,375 --> 00:08:01,000
Cheers to my little sister.

205
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:02,166
CARMEN:
Oh.

206
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:03,750
I'm so excited for you.

207
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:05,875
And this a beautiful journey
you're about to take,

208
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:07,958
I hope it goes better for you
than it did for me.

209
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:08,833
Cheers to you!

210
00:08:08,916 --> 00:08:09,916
JUNE:
Cheers!

211
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,541
[cheering]

212
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:11,666
Ah! Okay.

213
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,791
[Liz chuckles]

214
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:15,583
Dude, Sadie was married?

215
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:18,000
I might be the youngest
divorcee there ever was.

216
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:20,083
I married Satan himself,
so that was fun.

217
00:08:21,416 --> 00:08:22,125
Super fun.

218
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:23,958
Great divorce settlement,
though.

219
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:26,458
What's that supposed
to mean, June?

220
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:27,750
Nothing.

221
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:30,000
Just set you up nicely.

222
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:32,083
I didn't need his money,
thank you.

223
00:08:32,166 --> 00:08:33,083
You took it, though.

224
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:34,500
All right, all right, all right.

225
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:35,625
That's enough, ladies.

226
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:38,000
It's just sisterly love
this weekend

227
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:39,166
and good times.

228
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:39,791
CARMEN:
Good times.

229
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:40,333
Right.

230
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:41,208
And good vibes.

231
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:43,458
We need a game.

232
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:44,000
CARMEN:
Yes.

233
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:44,625
JUNE:
Yes!

234
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:45,375
[June chuckling]

235
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:45,916
Okay.

236
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,458
Yes!

237
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:47,000
And drinks.

238
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:49,625
Let's play
who knows June best?

239
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:50,291
Oh, that's not fair.

240
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:51,583
You're obviously gonna win.

241
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:54,333
Okay, fuck it.

242
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:55,250
Let's do it.

243
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:58,375
So, we're all gonna take turns
asking June a question.

244
00:08:58,458 --> 00:09:00,083
June's gonna be the judge.

245
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:01,708
If you answer wrong,
you take a drink.

246
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:02,541
Right.

247
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,833
If you don't know the answer,
you take two drinks.

248
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:07,500
Ooh,
about to get fucked up in here.

249
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,916
[chuckles]

250
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,291
Liz, that's two drinks
if you get it wrong, okay.

251
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:12,625
Okay, I'm gonna go first.

252
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:16,166
Okay, when did June
lose her virginity?

253
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:16,708
-14!
-14!

254
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:17,708
That’s like uh--

255
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:18,583
CARMEN:
It's really young.

256
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:19,583
[ladies chuckling]

257
00:09:19,666 --> 00:09:21,291
Girl!

258
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:23,250
I have a question.

259
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:25,750
What is June's favorite movie?

260
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:26,625
Ooh, Sharknado.

261
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:27,541
Okay,
you're just trying to drink.

262
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:28,083
CARMEN:
What?

263
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:28,833
[Carmen chuckling]

264
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:30,000
[Sadie chuckles]

265
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:30,958
Spice World.

266
00:09:31,041 --> 00:09:32,208
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

267
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:32,750
CARMEN:
Really?

268
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:33,791
Not by choice.

269
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:36,375
It's only cause this psycho
over here made me watch it

270
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:37,666
over, and over, and over,
and over again.

271
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:38,666
You loved it.

272
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:41,083
And then, she would make me act
out all the songs with her.

273
00:09:41,166 --> 00:09:41,708
That's cute.

274
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:42,833
We were good.

275
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:43,500
Not cute,

276
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,125
but she'd make me be
Sporty Spice.

277
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:45,875
[Betty chuckles]

278
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:46,875
Sporty Spice sucks.

279
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:47,416
[Betty chuckles]

280
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,291
What?

281
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:54,583
This is really great, guys.

282
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:56,541
It's exactly what I wanted.

283
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:58,208
Five bitches alone
in the desert

284
00:09:58,291 --> 00:09:59,708
is exactly what you wanted?

285
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:00,583
[chuckles]

286
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:02,291
Yeah, it actually is.

287
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:03,833
Aw.

288
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,166
Hey, you fucking zombie.

289
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:11,291
Why don't you go upstairs
and join Grandma Betty in bed?

290
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:12,833
Go night-night.

291
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:18,708
You know what, June?

292
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:20,583
I have to be honest.

293
00:10:20,666 --> 00:10:22,041
Because I don't really think
anyone else

294
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:25,541
in this fucking situation
is gonna fucking say it.

295
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:29,375
Or anything else pertaining
to what we're all thinking.

296
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:31,166
What the fuck
are you talking about?

297
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:32,750
Yeah, what are you
talking about?

298
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:36,583
Like, I just don't get this.
[chuckles]

299
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:38,333
Like, any of this.

300
00:10:38,416 --> 00:10:41,958
Like, why aren't you inviting
anyone to your wedding?

301
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:43,708
You used to talk
about your big dream wedding

302
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:45,125
all the time when we were kids.

303
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:47,750
This isn't it.

304
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:49,083
Well, I'm not a kid anymore.

305
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:51,750
Okay, then why
aren't you inviting anyone

306
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:52,708
to meet this guy

307
00:10:52,791 --> 00:10:55,333
who you're marrying
in such a fucking hurry?

308
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:57,500
Do you even know
who I am anymore?

309
00:10:57,583 --> 00:10:58,958
Okay, wow.

310
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:00,000
What's that supposed to mean?

311
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:01,291
Oh, I don't know.

312
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:02,291
We hardly see each other.

313
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:03,833
We don't even hang out anymore.

314
00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:05,250
Well, maybe it's because
I don't want to be

315
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:06,333
in this new fucking circle

316
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:08,375
of whatever the fuck
this fucking thing is.

317
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:08,916
JUNE:
Okay, whatever.

318
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,416
Hey, what the fuck did I do?

319
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,250
Oh, what the fuck
didn't you do, Carmen?

320
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:12,916
You fucking bitch.

321
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,458
-You know what you fucking did!
-Oh my God.

322
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:15,500
Did you call me a bitch?

323
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,875
Okay, this is fucking crazy.

324
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:19,041
You're fucking drunk, Liz.

325
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:20,166
Okay, guys, come on.

326
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:20,708
Come on.

327
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:21,750
Seriously.

328
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:23,250
You are drunk.

329
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:24,000
Okay, and look,

330
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:25,625
I have a bunch
of fun shit planned tomorrow.

331
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:27,041
Can we just all get along

332
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:29,250
and not ruin the trip
before it's even happened?

333
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:31,625
Of course, you're trying
to ruin this.

334
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:34,333
Anytime something
isn't about you.

335
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:35,500
Go to bed.

336
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:37,666
Dang.

337
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:40,041
Nothing's ever about me!

338
00:11:44,916 --> 00:11:46,125
You okay?

339
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:48,833
She just pisses me off.

340
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,541
I shouldn't have invited her.

341
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:53,583
I'm barely even friends
with her anymore.

342
00:11:53,666 --> 00:11:54,125
Stop it.

343
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:55,291
Yes, you are.

344
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:58,833
Of course, you'd say that,
you agree with her.

345
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:02,125
About what?

346
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:04,125
Um, my wedding.

347
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:05,416
I know you don't approve.

348
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,958
Okay, you're not fooling anyone
around here

349
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:10,375
with your overly supportive,
everything is great bullshit.

350
00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:13,000
Are you fucking
kidding me right now?

351
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:15,083
All I've done is support you.

352
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:18,083
Don't turn this around
on me, okay?

353
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:20,541
You just said no to everything.

354
00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:23,333
The nice hotel,
the beach vacation.

355
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:24,166
The fucking spa thing.

356
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:28,625
I mean,
fucking look around you.

357
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:30,791
Look where we are.

358
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:33,000
There it is.

359
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:37,375
You know what?
Why don't you all just leave?

360
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:41,083
I don't want any of that shit,
Sadie!

361
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:42,958
I don't care about it.

362
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:46,833
I know you don't like him.

363
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:48,916
And I know that you're afraid
that I'm gonna make

364
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,833
the same fucking mistake
that you did.

365
00:12:51,916 --> 00:12:56,833
Not everybody cares about--
about money and fucking status.

366
00:12:56,916 --> 00:12:58,541
I think it's gross.

367
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:03,291
All you care about is--
is your new car,

368
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:04,791
and your stupid fucking job,

00:21:08,625 --> 00:21:10,166
Oh yeah.

557
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:10,750
Lovely.

558
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:12,250
I'll take one.

559
00:21:14,458 --> 00:21:15,708
Uh, so babe,

560
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:19,500
um, Sadie was just making us
a sweet toast, babe.

561
00:21:19,583 --> 00:21:21,958
We have enough for them, right?

562
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:23,416
Holy tits.

563
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,625
I'll always drink to us, baby.

564
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:31,125
Maybe that's not for me.

565
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:32,916
Puppy, throw me a beer.

566
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:40,666
Oh, babe! [chuckles]

567
00:21:40,791 --> 00:21:41,291
June.

568
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:42,458
What?

569
00:21:42,541 --> 00:21:43,416
Bedroom now.

570
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:44,625
Okay, ow.

571
00:21:44,708 --> 00:21:45,541
Hey ow.

572
00:21:45,625 --> 00:21:47,666
Somebody's in trouble.

573
00:21:56,458 --> 00:21:58,250
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

574
00:21:58,333 --> 00:21:59,208
I wanted to tell you,

575
00:21:59,291 --> 00:22:00,666
but I was afraid
that you would say no.

576
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:02,291
Say no to what?

577
00:22:02,375 --> 00:22:03,875
Four drunken idiots
pounding down the door

578
00:22:03,958 --> 00:22:05,750
in the middle of the night,
scaring the shit out of us.

579
00:22:05,833 --> 00:22:06,750
Come on.

580
00:22:06,833 --> 00:22:08,125
Sadie, that's not cool.

581
00:22:08,208 --> 00:22:09,833
Okay, they're not staying.

582
00:22:09,916 --> 00:22:12,583
David wanted to come by
and meet everybody.

583
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:15,416
Him and his buddies are leaving
later tonight.

584
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:15,958
Okay.

585
00:22:16,041 --> 00:22:17,666
They said they were close by

586
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:20,166
and I said it was cool
if they could stop in.

587
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:22,458
I should have told you,
I'm sorry.

588
00:22:23,791 --> 00:22:27,583
I mean, he was actually worried
that you'd be mad.

589
00:22:27,666 --> 00:22:29,166
Yeah, he was right.

590
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:31,666
Come on, Sadie.

591
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:32,791
All you guys ever talk

592
00:22:32,875 --> 00:22:35,250
about is how you know nothing
about David.

593
00:22:35,333 --> 00:22:37,500
Nobody knows his life,
his friends.

594
00:22:37,583 --> 00:22:39,416
Well, here is
a perfect opportunity

595
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:40,500
for you to get to know him.

596
00:22:40,583 --> 00:22:43,125
And maybe even like him.

597
00:22:43,791 --> 00:22:45,166
[sighs]

598
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:46,541
It's fine.

599
00:22:46,625 --> 00:22:47,083
Okay, I'm sorry.

600
00:22:47,166 --> 00:22:49,708
I just-- I wish I knew.

601
00:22:49,791 --> 00:22:50,708
Ah.

602
00:22:55,166 --> 00:23:00,000
“Chateau Lafite Limier.

603
00:23:00,083 --> 00:23:03,000
2003”, that was a good year.

604
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,875
You want some?

605
00:23:06,958 --> 00:23:08,583
No.

606
00:23:10,333 --> 00:23:11,083
Okay.

607
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:16,041
[Carmen chuckling]

608
00:23:16,125 --> 00:23:19,291
This one time I saw a raccoon
trying to fuck a turtle.

609
00:23:19,375 --> 00:23:19,833
Bullshit.

610
00:23:19,916 --> 00:23:20,416
[Carmen chuckling]

611
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:21,250
I swear to God,

612
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:22,416
that turtle was trying
to get away.

613
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:23,166
Couldn't do it, man.

614
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:23,833
Too slow.

615
00:23:23,916 --> 00:23:24,625
[chuckles]

616
00:23:24,708 --> 00:23:26,166
[chuckles]

617
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:29,250
Hey, uh, princess Buttercup.

618
00:23:29,333 --> 00:23:30,291
Yeah.

619
00:23:30,375 --> 00:23:31,833
Check this out.

620
00:23:33,666 --> 00:23:35,375
Wow, sexy.

621
00:23:35,458 --> 00:23:36,166
What do you say?

622
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:37,791
[chuckles]

623
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:38,333
[Bobby chuckling]

624
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:39,125
Stupid.

625
00:23:39,208 --> 00:23:41,125
What happened?

626
00:23:41,208 --> 00:23:42,291
Don't ask.

627
00:23:42,375 --> 00:23:42,958
Why?

628
00:23:43,041 --> 00:23:44,541
Yeah, I want to know.

629
00:23:44,625 --> 00:23:46,750
Alright. He lost it in a bet.

630
00:23:46,833 --> 00:23:50,916
I'm sorry, how do you
lose a ear in a bet?

631
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,083
Well, Betty Boop,
if you must know,

632
00:23:53,166 --> 00:23:54,916
it was more of a game of chance
than a bet.

633
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,583
More a game of stupidity.

634
00:23:56,666 --> 00:23:58,708
Poof. Come on.

635
00:23:58,791 --> 00:24:00,541
Anyways, I was right
outside of Elkin

636
00:24:00,625 --> 00:24:03,833
in this shitty little bar,
drunk as hell,

637
00:24:03,916 --> 00:24:06,041
and in walks this dude.

638
00:24:06,125 --> 00:24:07,875
He was older,
dressed kind of fancy.

639
00:24:07,958 --> 00:24:10,375
He had some kind of an accent,
French

640
00:24:10,458 --> 00:24:12,250
or Mexican, or something.

641
00:24:12,333 --> 00:24:15,958
Oh, yeah,
that's very culturally similar.

642
00:24:16,041 --> 00:24:16,875
MIKE:
What?

643
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,041
How was I supposed to know?

644
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:21,666
I only speak American.

645
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:23,583
Anyways, this dude sits down
right next to me

646
00:24:23,666 --> 00:24:27,083
and asks for a light,
so, I pull out my lighter.

647
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:30,250
The lighter my grandpops
gave me right before he died.

648
00:24:30,333 --> 00:24:34,125
A beautiful, antique Ronson,
silver--

649
00:24:34,208 --> 00:24:36,625
Come on, man,
get to the goddamn point.

650
00:24:36,708 --> 00:24:38,041
Yeah, the part where
your ear falls off.

651
00:24:38,125 --> 00:24:39,000
[Bobby chuckles]

652
00:24:39,083 --> 00:24:40,583
-Fuck y'all.
-[Carmen chuckles]

653
00:24:40,666 --> 00:24:42,291
-[Bobby chuckling]
-[June chuckling]

654
00:24:42,375 --> 00:24:45,250
Anyways, this dude
takes a shine to my lighter

655
00:24:45,333 --> 00:24:47,375
and asks me
how reliable it is.

656
00:24:47,458 --> 00:24:50,250
I tell him
it's reliable as fuck.

657
00:24:50,333 --> 00:24:52,625
‘Cause it's fucking
American made.

658
00:24:52,708 --> 00:24:53,375
So, he laughs

659
00:24:53,458 --> 00:24:54,916
and takes out this crazy-ass
fucking knife

660
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,541
and puts it on the bar.

661
00:24:56,625 --> 00:24:57,875
He tells me
it's from the Middle East

662
00:24:57,958 --> 00:24:59,041
or something worth thousands.

663
00:24:59,125 --> 00:25:00,833
I could tell he was
telling the truth,

664
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:02,375
'cause it had all these
jihad symbols

665
00:25:02,458 --> 00:25:04,666
and shit carved in it.

666
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:06,041
He then says,

667
00:25:06,125 --> 00:25:07,875
if my American lighter
can light 10 times

668
00:25:07,958 --> 00:25:11,666
in row without fail,
I get to keep the knife.

669
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:12,625
If not,

670
00:25:12,708 --> 00:25:14,625
he cuts off my ear
with the knife

671
00:25:14,708 --> 00:25:16,458
and also gets
to keep the lighter.

672
00:25:16,541 --> 00:25:19,041
Let me guess what happened.

673
00:25:19,125 --> 00:25:20,416
Well, you know
what fucking happened.

674
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:21,291
[Carmen chuckles]

675
00:25:21,375 --> 00:25:22,916
Piece of shit lighter only made
it to three

676
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:23,750
and flamed out.

677
00:25:23,833 --> 00:25:24,500
[David chuckles]

678
00:25:24,583 --> 00:25:26,083
So, instead of
just walking away,

679
00:25:26,166 --> 00:25:27,750
this jackass lets
the motherfucker

680
00:25:27,833 --> 00:25:29,375
saw his ear off clean.

681
00:25:29,458 --> 00:25:32,333
Hey, I may be a jackass,
but I'm also a man of my word.

682
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:34,375
[chuckles]

683
00:25:34,458 --> 00:25:37,708
So uh, why are you guys here?

684
00:25:38,625 --> 00:25:39,625
We're here to see you, baby.

685
00:25:39,708 --> 00:25:41,291
Fucking Casanova.

686
00:25:41,375 --> 00:25:42,916
Do not listen to a word he says.

687
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:43,666
MIKE:
Fuck you.

688
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:45,458
He's more full of shit
than a 10-pound robin.

689
00:25:45,541 --> 00:25:46,541
MIKE:
Fuck you. Fuck you, man.

690
00:25:46,625 --> 00:25:47,583
Settle the fuck down.

691
00:25:47,666 --> 00:25:48,583
[June chuckles]

692
00:25:50,375 --> 00:25:53,583
And truth be told,
I just wanted to meet y'all.

693
00:25:53,666 --> 00:25:56,125
Hey, Junie talks
about yous all the time.

694
00:25:56,208 --> 00:25:59,833
Hey, yeah, I know we could be
a little crude,

695
00:25:59,916 --> 00:26:02,500
rough around the edges.

696
00:26:02,583 --> 00:26:04,750
But I guarantee
there ain't nobody

697
00:26:04,833 --> 00:26:07,791
that'll take better care
of this little girl than me.

698
00:26:09,166 --> 00:26:10,750
Hm?

699
00:26:10,833 --> 00:26:11,833
Wait a second.

700
00:26:11,916 --> 00:26:13,750
I thought you were
missing a tooth?

701
00:26:13,833 --> 00:26:14,833
-[Carmen chuckling]
-Betty!

702
00:26:14,916 --> 00:26:16,083
What?

703
00:26:16,166 --> 00:26:17,416
Sadie said that he was.

704
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,291
Did she say that?

705
00:26:19,375 --> 00:26:20,791
Well, it grew back.

706
00:26:22,083 --> 00:26:23,541
-[Carmen chuckling]
-[chuckles]

707
00:26:23,625 --> 00:26:24,541
Oh.

708
00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:25,541
[sniffs]

709
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:27,916
Oh, you smell good.

710
00:26:29,458 --> 00:26:30,333
Like a strawberry.

711
00:26:30,416 --> 00:26:31,333
[chuckles]

712
00:26:31,416 --> 00:26:32,708
Thanks, creep.

713
00:26:32,791 --> 00:26:34,125
Am I?

714
00:26:34,208 --> 00:26:36,000
Am I a creep?

715
00:26:36,083 --> 00:26:36,583
[chuckles]

716
00:26:36,666 --> 00:26:37,791
DAVID:
Be good, Mikey.

717
00:26:37,875 --> 00:26:39,166
Eyes on the prize.

718
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:40,708
Oh, make no mistake.

719
00:26:40,791 --> 00:26:42,958
I am the prize.

720
00:26:43,041 --> 00:26:45,250
I just can't have my guys
getting all distracted

721
00:26:45,333 --> 00:26:46,125
by the snatch.

722
00:26:46,208 --> 00:26:47,166
CARMEN:
Oh.

723
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:50,875
Especially since we haven't
secured a perimeter for y'all.

724
00:26:50,958 --> 00:26:52,791
The what?

725
00:26:52,875 --> 00:26:55,708
The perimeter.

726
00:26:55,791 --> 00:26:57,666
You see,
on this property at night,

727
00:26:57,750 --> 00:27:01,666
sometimes we get
a few uninvited guests.

728
00:27:02,208 --> 00:27:04,583
Hmm. Imagine that.

729
00:27:04,666 --> 00:27:07,041
Big cats come down
from the hills

730
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:09,041
looking for trouble.

731
00:27:09,125 --> 00:27:12,958
Bobcats, mountain lions, even.

732
00:27:13,041 --> 00:27:14,750
A real menace.

733
00:27:14,833 --> 00:27:16,791
Mean as fuck, too.

734
00:27:17,583 --> 00:27:19,333
And since you ladies are here
all alone,

735
00:27:19,416 --> 00:27:21,916
we figured it’s the least
we could do.

736
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,416
Thanks, babe.

737
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:26,166
Wait, you're gonna kill them?

738
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:28,500

00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:45,250
I fucking...

1106
00:43:45,333 --> 00:43:46,916
I fucking saw it.

1107
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:47,833
With my own eyes.

1108
00:43:47,916 --> 00:43:48,458
And--

1109
00:43:48,541 --> 00:43:50,125
And Liz was yelling at him.

1110
00:43:50,208 --> 00:43:53,083
And then there was this blood
all over the windshield.

1111
00:43:53,166 --> 00:43:53,750
And she's dead.

1112
00:43:53,833 --> 00:43:55,875
I'm telling you,
she's fucking dead, Betty.

1113
00:43:55,958 --> 00:43:57,000
BETTY:
Are you sure?

1114
00:43:57,083 --> 00:44:00,041
I'm fucking sure!

1115
00:44:00,125 --> 00:44:02,416
Oh God.

1116
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:03,708
Okay.

1117
00:44:03,791 --> 00:44:06,208
Oh God, I need to think.

1118
00:44:06,291 --> 00:44:07,750
Let me think for a second.

1119
00:44:09,541 --> 00:44:10,458
Okay, we need to go.

1120
00:44:10,541 --> 00:44:12,666
We need to get out of here.
We need to get in the car.

1121
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:14,083
We need to go,
like right now, okay?

1122
00:44:14,166 --> 00:44:16,333
[both pant]

1123
00:44:16,416 --> 00:44:17,166
BETTY:
Okay, June.

1124
00:44:17,250 --> 00:44:17,791
Let's get June.

1125
00:44:17,875 --> 00:44:19,708
-Where's June?
-June!

1126
00:44:19,791 --> 00:44:20,625
She's out there with them.

1127
00:44:20,708 --> 00:44:21,958
Betty, she's out there
with them.

1128
00:44:22,041 --> 00:44:23,000
-Betty, I--
-Oh my God.

1129
00:44:23,666 --> 00:44:24,958
June, June!

1130
00:44:25,041 --> 00:44:26,875
DAVID:
We're in here, ladies!

1131
00:44:26,958 --> 00:44:28,208
[screams]

1132
00:44:31,458 --> 00:44:32,583
Where's Liz?

1133
00:44:32,666 --> 00:44:34,958
Hey, she's not feeling well.

1134
00:44:35,041 --> 00:44:36,500
[cries]

1135
00:44:36,583 --> 00:44:38,041
You killed her!

1136
00:44:38,125 --> 00:44:38,875
Jesus.

1137
00:44:38,958 --> 00:44:41,916
Why is everybody so uptight
around here?

1138
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,416
[Betty shouts]

1139
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:46,500
[Sadie screaming]

1140
00:44:52,833 --> 00:44:55,208
No, David!

1141
00:44:55,291 --> 00:44:56,500
David!

1142
00:44:56,583 --> 00:44:58,208
What are you doing?

1143
00:44:58,875 --> 00:45:00,541
Lock your door.

1144
00:45:07,250 --> 00:45:10,416
Pups, nice of you to join us.

1145
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:12,833
I assume you're finished
with the play thing?

1146
00:45:14,541 --> 00:45:16,333
Don't you fucking touch me!

1147
00:45:16,416 --> 00:45:17,041
Fuck you!

1148
00:45:17,125 --> 00:45:18,291
June, sit down!

1149
00:45:19,791 --> 00:45:21,208
Sit down.

1150
00:45:21,291 --> 00:45:28,291
Okay, so June baby,
the light of my life,

1151
00:45:28,375 --> 00:45:31,750
I know this might be
little embarrassing for you.

1152
00:45:31,833 --> 00:45:35,125
You know, having to admit your
friends were right about me.

1153
00:45:35,208 --> 00:45:37,958
I'm not a nice guy.

1154
00:45:38,041 --> 00:45:41,083
I'm not exactly
what I said I was.

1155
00:45:41,166 --> 00:45:43,875
I don't understand any of this.

1156
00:45:43,958 --> 00:45:45,875
Well, tell her the other thing.

1157
00:45:45,958 --> 00:45:48,291
You want me to tell?

1158
00:45:48,375 --> 00:45:50,625
Please don't kill us. [cries]

1159
00:45:50,708 --> 00:45:51,291
Boops!

1160
00:45:51,375 --> 00:45:52,958
You're ruining the surprise!

1161
00:45:53,041 --> 00:45:54,750
Okay, I'll tell you.

1162
00:45:54,833 --> 00:45:57,791
I think they might already
know about it by now, don't you?

1163
00:45:57,875 --> 00:45:59,500
MIKE;
Yeah, your friends are dead.

1164
00:45:59,583 --> 00:46:00,041
Sorry.

1165
00:46:00,125 --> 00:46:01,041
No please, David.

1166
00:46:01,125 --> 00:46:01,791
Please just let her go.

1167
00:46:01,875 --> 00:46:04,791
You have two choices, alright?

1168
00:46:04,875 --> 00:46:06,666
And honestly, I'm gonna leave
it for you all to decide,

1169
00:46:06,750 --> 00:46:10,791
because I'm happy
with either choice.

1170
00:46:10,875 --> 00:46:13,875
So, listen carefully,
because it's a big decision.

1171
00:46:14,666 --> 00:46:16,625
One.

1172
00:46:16,708 --> 00:46:18,375
I could blow her
fucking head off.

1173
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,666
No, David she has kids!

1174
00:46:21,750 --> 00:46:22,791
Please.

1175
00:46:22,875 --> 00:46:23,708
Don't interrupt me, June.

1176
00:46:23,791 --> 00:46:26,083
BETTY:
My babies. [crying]

1177
00:46:26,166 --> 00:46:29,041
Or two.

1178
00:46:29,125 --> 00:46:29,958
I could rip her open

1179
00:46:30,041 --> 00:46:31,583
and have her insides spill out
on the floor

1180
00:46:31,666 --> 00:46:33,666
and fucking eat her
for breakfast.

1181
00:46:35,750 --> 00:46:39,125
See,
I told you it's a big decision.

1182
00:46:39,208 --> 00:46:41,125
See, he told you.

1183
00:46:41,208 --> 00:46:42,666
I think we should eat her.

1184
00:46:45,333 --> 00:46:47,250
Here's the kicker.

1185
00:46:47,333 --> 00:46:50,375
You know, by now
you're probably realizing

1186
00:46:50,458 --> 00:46:52,375
that we're not what most folk

1187
00:46:52,458 --> 00:46:55,416
would exactly refer
to as normal.

1188
00:46:56,416 --> 00:47:00,708
You know, old Betty
here's gonna die either way.

1189
00:47:00,791 --> 00:47:03,375
But if I opt to eat her,

1190
00:47:03,458 --> 00:47:06,458
then there's still a chance
that old Betty will rise again

1191
00:47:06,541 --> 00:47:08,166
to party in the after party.

1192
00:47:08,250 --> 00:47:09,083
Please, David...

1193
00:47:09,166 --> 00:47:12,291
Again with
the fucking interruptions!

1194
00:47:12,375 --> 00:47:13,208
I can't stand women.

1195
00:47:13,291 --> 00:47:14,875
What's with that?

1196
00:47:14,958 --> 00:47:16,791
They never stop.

1197
00:47:16,875 --> 00:47:17,416
Never stop.

1198
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:18,750
[sobs]

1199
00:47:18,833 --> 00:47:22,541
Sadie, if you shut the fuck up
and listen,

1200
00:47:22,625 --> 00:47:25,583
I'll clue you in
on a little secret.

1201
00:47:25,666 --> 00:47:28,375
You know,
if I do elect to eat her,

1202
00:47:28,458 --> 00:47:32,083
you will be able
to bring her back.

1203
00:47:32,166 --> 00:47:34,500
Okay, what the fuck
are you talking about?

1204
00:47:34,583 --> 00:47:35,333
DAVID:
Shh!

1205
00:47:36,833 --> 00:47:40,250
Remember, listen.

1206
00:47:42,333 --> 00:47:50,208
All you gotta do is
bury the body nice and deep.

1207
00:47:50,291 --> 00:47:51,500
You see, this land here,

1208
00:47:51,583 --> 00:47:54,666
this is some un-fucking
holy land.

1209
00:47:54,750 --> 00:47:58,916
If you bury her,
she will come back.

1210
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,708
And she will be one of us.

1211
00:48:00,791 --> 00:48:03,583
I'd rather fucking die!

1212
00:48:03,666 --> 00:48:04,791
Tell 'em the best part.

1213
00:48:04,875 --> 00:48:06,875
Oh, yeah, this is good.

1214
00:48:06,958 --> 00:48:09,750
See, y'all are probably
wondering,

1215
00:48:09,833 --> 00:48:14,500
especially you, Junie,
why the engagement party?

1216
00:48:14,583 --> 00:48:16,375
Why the wedding plans?

1217
00:48:17,458 --> 00:48:19,416
You see, the boys and me,

1218
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:23,541
we started a tradition,
many years ago.

1219
00:48:23,625 --> 00:48:26,375
And I gotta say,
I am not most proud of this

1220
00:48:26,458 --> 00:48:29,208
but hey,
it is what it is.

1221
00:48:30,916 --> 00:48:37,166
See, what we do is,
we take turns finding a woman.

1222
00:48:37,250 --> 00:48:39,333
Usually desperate.

1223
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:43,291
Eager to get out
of her boring life.

1224
00:48:43,375 --> 00:48:45,041
Eager to get married.

1225
00:48:45,125 --> 00:48:47,583
You know the type, right, June?

1226
00:48:49,250 --> 00:48:52,291
So we get our brides-to-be,

1227
00:48:52,375 --> 00:48:56,041
and we get their friends,
and their families

1228
00:48:56,125 --> 00:48:58,750
to come out here
for a little bachelorette party.

1229
00:48:58,833 --> 00:49:00,041
Last year was Mikey's turn.

1230
00:49:00,125 --> 00:49:01,833
That was a fucking wild one,
wasn't it, Mikey?

1231
00:49:01,916 --> 00:49:02,875
[chuckles]

1232
00:49:02,958 --> 00:49:04,125
Sure was.

1233
00:49:04,208 --> 00:49:05,541
Goddamn.

1234
00:49:06,791 --> 00:49:10,750
We hunt them down one by one.

1235
00:49:10,833 --> 00:49:15,875
Eat 'em, drink their blood.

1236
00:49:15,958 --> 00:49:20,333
And the ones we really like
we bring back for a little play.

1237
00:49:20,416 --> 00:49:21,750
You get the picture.

1238
00:49:21,833 --> 00:49:23,750
[pants]

1239
00:49:28,791 --> 00:49:31,583
Shouldn't leave these things
laying around, you fucks!

1240
00:49:31,666 --> 00:49:32,333
June, the gun!

1241
00:49:32,416 --> 00:49:33,208
Get the gun!

1242
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,125
Come on, baby.

1243
00:49:39,208 --> 00:49:40,916
You don't want to do that.

1244
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:41,666
Yes, I do.

1245
00:49:41,750 --> 00:49:42,958
You fucking freak!

1246
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:46,083
I'm gonna fucking destroy you.

1247
00:49:46,166 --> 00:49:47,916
Yeah, move
and your fucking next.

1248
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:53,125
Puppy, buddy old pal,
care to step in on any of this?

1249
00:49:53,208 --> 00:49:56,833
I gotta say, Junie,
your sister's got a heart

1250
00:49:56,916 --> 00:49:58,625
I'm gonna enjoy ripping it
out of her chest

1251
00:49:58,708 --> 00:50:00,750
and eating it in front of you.

1252
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:04,666
You ain't gonna shoot me.

1253
00:50:05,666 --> 00:50:06,333
[gasps]

1254
00:50:08,041 --> 00:50:08,625
Wow.

1255
00:50:08,708 --> 00:50:10,541
I did not think you had that
in you.

1256
00:50:12,875 --> 00:50:15,666
Let's assess
the current situation.

1257
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:16,208
Hm?

1258
00:50:16,291 --> 00:50:18,250
We have two guns.

1259
00:50:18,333 --> 00:50:20,333
Mine, which I know
is fully loaded

1260
00:50:20,416 --> 00:50:21,875
and pointed at old Betty's head.

1261
00:50:21,958 --> 00:50:22,875
[cries]

1262
00:50:22,958 --> 00:50:26,791
And yours, which may
or may not have any shots in it.

1263
00:50:26,875 --> 00:50:29,666
I'm gonna guess not,
but I could be wrong.

1264
00:50:29,750 --> 00:50:32,791
Now, if you are lucky enough
to have a fully-loaded weapon,

1265
00:50:32,875 --> 00:50:35,500
then you could shoot me,
and you could kill me,

1266
00:50:35,583 --> 00:50:37,750
but I am certain
that a very upset Bobby

1267
00:50:37,833 --> 00:50:41,666
or a very unstable Puppy
will rip your sister apart

1268
00:50:41,750 --> 00:50:43,875
before my body hits the ground.

1269
00:50:46,750 --> 00:50:49,833
I say this could play out
in a lot of ways,

1270
00:50:49,916 --> 00:50:53,125
but the end result
is always the same.

1271
00:50:53,208 --> 00:50:54,666
Y'all die.

1272
00:50:54,750 --> 00:50:56,291
Don't be so sure of that.

1273
00:50:56,375 --> 00:50:57,791
DAVID:
Then try me.

1274
00:51:00,291 --> 00:51:01,708
Shoot.

1275
00:51:01,791 --> 00:51:04,708
[taking deep breaths]

1276
00:51:08,458 --> 00:51:10,625
DAVID:
That's a good girl.

1277
00:51:10,708 --> 00:51:12,958
Listen, I have an idea.

1278
00:51:13,041 --> 00:51:14,375
Why don't we drop the gun

1279
00:51:14,458 --> 00:51:16,375
and get you three out
of the shed?

1280
00:51:16,458 --> 00:51:17,166

I would've let you go, though.

1466

I promise,
I would've let you go.

1467

telling the truth?

Can it get it wet?

How the fuck should I know?

1494
01:03:03,791 --> 01:03:05,000
The first time I used it was

1495
01:03:05,083 --> 01:03:06,541
to blow a fucking vampire's
head off.

1496
01:03:06,625 --> 01:03:07,416
Okay, okay.

Oh, right.

June, they fucking took it.

Wait, I don't get it.

1535
01:04:21,875 --> 01:04:22,541
They grabbed the gun,

1536
01:04:22,625 --> 01:04:24,125
but they don't check
the hot tub?

1537
01:04:24,666 --> 01:04:25,666
I think they're
toying with us, June.

1538
01:04:25,750 --> 01:04:26,583
Or they're really
fucking stupid.

1539
01:04:26,666 --> 01:04:27,791
Let's just hope they're stupid.

1540

We gotta go.

01:04:28,458 --> 01:04:29,166
We gotta go, okay?

What is it?

1559
01:05:00,083 --> 01:05:01,208
I think it's a bear trap.

Help me open it, okay?

Okay. Okay.

How do we pry it?

Just pull it, pull it, pull it.

Okay.
