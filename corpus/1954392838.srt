1
00:03:16,755 --> 00:03:17,839
YEAH, YOU'RE FIRED.

2
00:03:17,881 --> 00:03:19,674
NO.

3
00:03:19,674 --> 00:03:22,510
HEY, CRAWL BACK INTO
THE GODDAMN BOTTLE YOU LIVE IN.

4
00:03:35,941 --> 00:03:37,734
GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.

5
00:03:37,734 --> 00:03:39,027
YOU'RE FIRED.

6
00:03:44,866 --> 00:03:46,576
CLAIRE.

7
00:03:46,576 --> 00:03:47,369
OH.
HI.

8
00:03:47,369 --> 00:03:48,870
HOW ARE YOU, ROBIN?

9
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:50,080
GOOD.

10
00:03:55,752 --> 00:03:57,546
JUST GIVE ME
THE GODDAMN KEYS.

11
00:03:57,546 --> 00:03:59,381
HEY, YOU WANT SOME!

12
00:04:19,742 --> 00:04:21,281
LET'S HAVE A BIG HAND

13
00:04:21,818 --> 00:04:24,388
FOR THE HANFORD
HIGH SCHOOL BAND!

14
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,600
THAT WAS GREAT, KIDS.

15
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:28,687
GREAT.

16
00:04:32,015 --> 00:04:33,345
WELL...

17
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:34,907
EVERYBODY...

18
00:04:35,153 --> 00:04:36,553
THIS DAY

19
00:04:37,215 --> 00:04:39,345
HAS FINALLY ARRIVED.

20
00:04:40,018 --> 00:04:43,278
AND YOU ALL REMEMBER,
AS WELL AS I DO,

21
00:04:43,474 --> 00:04:46,474
HOW A FEW YEARS AGO
EVERYBODY WAS SAYING

22
00:04:46,713 --> 00:04:50,983
THIS TOWN WOULD NEVER BE
ANYTHING BUT A FARMING TOWN...

23
00:04:51,117 --> 00:04:52,237
TRAPPED IN THE PAST.

24
00:04:52,615 --> 00:04:54,195
ENJOYING THE SPEECH?

25
00:04:54,271 --> 00:04:55,971
NOT MUCH.

26
00:04:56,034 --> 00:04:57,234
THAT'S THE MAYOR.

27
00:04:57,599 --> 00:04:58,799
MAYOR GOODMAN.

28
00:04:59,262 --> 00:05:00,562
JUST A REAL WINDBAG.

29
00:05:00,866 --> 00:05:02,486
IS THAT RIGHT?

30
00:05:02,517 --> 00:05:04,799
YEAH, I'VE ONLY BEEN WORKING
FOR HIM ABOUT A WEEK.

31
00:05:05,026 --> 00:05:06,336
CONSTRUCTION FOREMAN.

32
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:08,790
I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER MET A GUY

33
00:05:08,915 --> 00:05:10,995
SO IN LOVE WITH HIS OWN VOICE.

34
00:05:11,216 --> 00:05:12,326
I KNOW THE TYPE.

35
00:05:12,617 --> 00:05:14,417
AH, HE'S A TYPICAL POLITICIAN,

36
00:05:14,338 --> 00:05:16,898
ACTING LIKE THEY'RE DOING IT FOR YOU.

37
00:05:17,012 --> 00:05:18,882
HE'S GOT TO HAVE A PIECE OF THIS DEAL.

38
00:05:19,589 --> 00:05:20,789
HE DOES.

39
00:05:20,898 --> 00:05:21,898
HIS FAMILY OWNS THE LAND.

40
00:05:22,108 --> 00:05:24,488
AN EVEN BRIGHTER FUTURE

41
00:05:24,513 --> 00:05:26,773
TO ADD TO OUR ILLUSTRIOUS PAST.

42
00:05:32,746 --> 00:05:34,046
SEE, THERE YOU GO?

43
00:05:34,219 --> 00:05:35,219
YEP.

44
00:05:41,916 --> 00:05:43,186
YOU FROM AROUND HERE?

45
00:05:43,408 --> 00:05:44,608
ONCE.

46
00:05:44,943 --> 00:05:45,943
MY NAME'S DILLON.

47
00:05:46,047 --> 00:05:47,047
DILLON HALE.

48
00:05:47,184 --> 00:05:48,184
I'M CLAIRE.

49
00:05:48,278 --> 00:05:50,978
IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU, DILLON.

50
00:05:51,198 --> 00:05:52,598
YOU GOT A LAST NAME, CLAIRE?

51
00:05:52,744 --> 00:05:56,289
CLAIRE.

52
00:05:56,289 --> 00:05:57,582
HELLO DAD.

53
00:05:57,582 --> 00:05:59,709
CLAIRE GOODMAN.

54
00:05:59,709 --> 00:06:01,086
EXCUSE ME.

55
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:06,091
WELL, DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE COMING BACK

56
00:06:06,091 --> 00:06:07,926
I WANTED TO SURPRISE YOU.

57
00:06:07,926 --> 00:06:09,219
YOU CERTAINLY HAVE.

58
00:06:09,219 --> 00:06:11,346
HELL OF A LONG TIME

59
00:06:11,346 --> 00:06:14,015
TO GO WITHOUT A CALL OR A LETTER.

60
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:16,476
WELL, YOU'VE BEEN
QUITE BUSY IN MY ABSENCE.

61
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:17,811
SAY, HALE.

62
00:06:20,605 --> 00:06:23,108
I HEARD YOU WERE HAVING SOME PROBLEM
WITH THAT THOMPSON BOY.

63
00:06:23,108 --> 00:06:26,069
WELL, NOT ANYMORE...
I JUST FIRED HIM.

64
00:06:26,069 --> 00:06:28,738
YOU KNOW, THAT BOY'S
DADDY AND I

65
00:06:28,738 --> 00:06:30,115
ARE GOOD FRIENDS...

66
00:06:30,115 --> 00:06:32,159
IF YOU UNDERTAND ME.

67
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:34,453
SO, I THINK THE BOY DESERVES A SECOND CHANCE.

68
00:06:34,453 --> 00:06:41,293
DON'T YOU?
SURE, OK.

69
00:06:41,293 --> 00:06:43,795
YEAH...

70
00:06:43,795 --> 00:06:44,754
GOODMAN.

71
00:06:46,548 --> 00:06:47,883
NICE TO MEET YOU, DILLON.

72
00:06:47,883 --> 00:06:50,177
OH, YEAH.

73
00:06:50,177 --> 00:06:52,179
JUST GOT BACK
INTO TOWN.

74
00:06:52,179 --> 00:06:54,014
DON'T YOU THINK
IT'S A LITTLE EARLY

75
00:06:54,014 --> 00:06:55,682
TO START MAKING NEW FRIENDS?

76
00:06:55,682 --> 00:06:57,017
I JUST TALKED TO HIM.

77
00:06:57,017 --> 00:06:59,644
- ABOUT WHAT?
- ABOUT YOU.

78
00:06:59,644 --> 00:07:02,731
I KNOW YOU WHEN IT
COMES TO MEN, CLAIRE.

79
00:07:02,731 --> 00:07:04,608
DON'T YOU GODDAMN
EMBARRASS ME.

80
00:07:04,608 --> 00:07:05,734
EMBARRAS?

81
00:07:05,734 --> 00:07:06,777
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

82
00:07:06,777 --> 00:07:08,403
WELL, WOULD IT
EMBARRASS YOU

83
00:07:08,403 --> 00:07:09,988
IF I INVITED HIM
TO DINNER TONIGHT?

84
00:07:09,988 --> 00:07:11,114
BECAUSE I DID.

85
00:07:11,114 --> 00:07:14,326
AH, YOU... YOU JUST...

86
00:07:14,326 --> 00:07:17,078
YOU JUST NEVER DO
STOP TESTING ME, DO YOU, GIRL?

87
00:07:17,078 --> 00:07:18,622
NOT UNTIL YOU PASS.

88
00:07:26,797 --> 00:07:29,216
HEY, DILLON!
WAIT UP.

89
00:07:31,093 --> 00:07:33,303
SO WHY DIDN'T YOU
TELL ME WHO YOU WERE.

90
00:07:33,303 --> 00:07:35,305
I DID.

91
00:07:35,305 --> 00:07:38,266
I MEAN BEFORE I GOT MY FOOT
CRAMMED DOWN MY MOUTH.

92
00:07:38,266 --> 00:07:40,811
AND MISS THE BENEFIT OF YOUR
BRILLIANT POLITICAL INSIGHTS?

93
00:07:40,811 --> 00:07:43,438
DID YOU TELL YOUR DAD
WHAT I SAID?

94
00:07:43,438 --> 00:07:45,148
YEAH, AND YOU NOW WHAT HE SAID?

95
00:07:45,148 --> 00:07:47,025
YOU'RE FIRED.

96
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:01,415
I WAS JUST TEASING BEFORE.

97
00:08:01,415 --> 00:08:03,417
MM-HMM.

98
00:08:03,417 --> 00:08:06,753
ACTUALLY, UH, MY FATHER
REALLY LIKES YOU.

99
00:08:06,753 --> 00:08:09,131
HE WANTED ME TO INVITE
YOU TO DINNER TONIGHT.

100
00:08:09,131 --> 00:08:12,259
REALLY.
UH-HUH.

101
00:08:12,259 --> 00:08:13,844
HE RESPECTS YOU.

102
00:08:13,844 --> 00:08:16,888
HE LOVES ANYONE
WHO'S A GOOD KISS-ASS.

103
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,822
HEY, DANNY, DID YOU GET
YOUR JOB BACK?

104
00:08:33,822 --> 00:08:35,866
SHIT, YEAH.
THAT FUCKER, DILLON,

105
00:08:35,866 --> 00:08:37,743
MY OLD MAN
WILL HAVE HIS ASS.

106
00:08:37,743 --> 00:08:39,870
- KNOW WHY?
- HA HA, WHY?

107
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:41,455
'CAUSE HE DON'T
MESS AROUND, BOY.

108
00:08:41,455 --> 00:08:43,081
COME ON. WHOOOO!

109
00:08:43,081 --> 00:08:45,167
YEAH! HA HA.

110
00:08:49,046 --> 00:08:53,467
COME ON, MAN.
GIME ME A BEER.

111
00:08:55,802 --> 00:08:58,221
COME ON, COME ON.

112
00:09:07,147 --> 00:09:10,484
WON'T YOU LISTEN
O A LITTLE BIT OF MY SOUL...

113
00:09:18,325 --> 00:09:21,203
I WANT TO TAKE YOU,
BABY, FAR AND WILD,

114
00:09:21,203 --> 00:09:28,585
LOVE YOU IN THE
SPIRITS' STYLE

115
00:09:35,342 --> 00:09:39,888
I LOVE WHEN YOU
TALK SO DEADLY...

116
00:09:39,888 --> 00:09:43,517
SO DEADLY...

117
00:09:55,404 --> 00:09:58,532
SHIT!

118
00:09:58,532 --> 00:10:00,075
AIN'T NOTHING
UT THE DEAD NO MORE...

119
00:10:17,509 --> 00:10:18,760
LET'S BAIL.

120
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,262
SHOULDN'T WE PUT IT BACK?

121
00:10:20,262 --> 00:10:21,430
LET DILLON DO IT, DICKHEAD.

122
00:10:23,098 --> 00:10:24,391
LET'S GO!

123
00:10:26,935 --> 00:10:29,229
I'LL BE THERE IN A MINUTE.

124
00:10:29,229 --> 00:10:30,647
NATURE CALLS.

125
00:10:36,903 --> 00:10:39,906
HOPE YOU DON'T MIND A LITTLE, UH,
IRRIGATION, DUDE?

126
00:11:17,444 --> 00:11:19,780
GET OUT OF THE WAY!

127
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:34,002
OH! OH, MY GOD!

128
00:11:52,562 --> 00:11:54,231
DUDE, WHAT'S UP?

129
00:11:54,231 --> 00:11:56,066
IT--IT--
IT WAS ALL AROUND ME!

130
00:11:56,066 --> 00:11:58,986
- DID--DID YOU SEE IT?
- YOU'RE WASTED, MAN

131
00:12:00,445 --> 00:12:02,281
LET'S GET THE FUCK
OUT OF HERE!

132
00:12:02,281 --> 00:12:03,198
GOD.

133
00:12:04,825 --> 00:12:06,034
HAVE ANOTHER BEER.

134
00:12:36,648 --> 00:12:37,983
HEY.

135
00:12:37,983 --> 00:12:39,735
YOU SHOWED UP.

136
00:12:39,735 --> 00:12:41,862
I'M FLATTERED.

137
00:12:41,862 --> 00:12:44,364
I'M ONLY HERE TO IMPRESS
YOUR FATHER, REMEBER?

138
00:12:44,364 --> 00:12:45,657
COME ON IN.

139
00:12:47,993 --> 00:12:49,286
BY THE WAY,

140
00:12:49,286 --> 00:12:51,288
YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL.

141
00:12:51,288 --> 00:12:52,497
SO DO YOU.

142
00:12:55,876 --> 00:12:57,878
LET ME INTRODUCE YOU
TO MY FAMILY.

143
00:12:57,878 --> 00:12:59,922
THIS IS UNCLE GEORGE.

144
00:12:59,922 --> 00:13:01,715
HOW YOU DOING?

145
00:13:01,715 --> 00:13:03,425
UNCLE GEORGE FARMED OUR LAND ALL THESE YEARS.

146
00:13:03,425 --> 00:13:04,468
HEY!

147
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:07,554
THIS BOY LOOKS LIKE
HE NEEDS A DRINK.

148
00:13:08,847 --> 00:13:11,350
AS DOES ANYBODY WHO WORKS
FOR MY BIG BROTHER.

149
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:13,393
HA HA, I HEAR YOU.

150
00:13:13,393 --> 00:13:15,979
UH, THIS IS MY UNCLE THADDEUS.

151
00:13:17,064 --> 00:13:19,608
- HOW YOU DOING?
- HIS WIFE BARBARA.

152
00:13:19,608 --> 00:13:20,901
HI, NICE TO MEET YOU.

153
00:13:20,901 --> 00:13:22,361
HELLO.

154
00:13:22,361 --> 00:13:23,070
OUR DAUGHTER, STEPHANIE.

155
00:13:25,447 --> 00:13:27,241
HI.

156
00:13:27,241 --> 00:13:29,076
HOPE TO SEE YOU IN CHURCH.

157
00:13:29,076 --> 00:13:29,910
YEA... YES, SIR.

158
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:32,412
DILLON.

159
00:13:32,412 --> 00:13:34,081
THIS IS MY UNCLE FRANK.

160
00:13:34,081 --> 00:13:35,123
HE'S OUR TOWN SHERIFF.

161
00:13:35,123 --> 00:13:36,416
HERE WE GO.

162
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:37,459
UNCLE FRANK, DILLON.

163
00:13:37,459 --> 00:13:38,585
HOW'S IT GOING?

164
00:13:38,585 --> 00:13:40,045
THIS IS TOBY AND MARTHA

165
00:13:40,045 --> 00:13:41,088
AND HIS WIFE, LORRAINE.

166
00:13:41,088 --> 00:13:42,798
HI THERE.

167
00:13:42,798 --> 00:13:45,676
GLAD I GOT A CHANCE TO MEET OU.

168
00:13:45,676 --> 00:13:48,762
I LIKE TO KNOW THE FOLKS HANGING
AROUND MY TOWN.

169
00:13:48,762 --> 00:13:50,931
WHY DON'T WE
HAVE A DRINK

170
00:13:50,931 --> 00:13:52,808
BEFORE HE ARRESTS YOU
FOR LOITERING?

171
00:13:52,808 --> 00:13:54,017
SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD IDEA.

172
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:00,440
LET US PRAY.

173
00:14:02,568 --> 00:14:05,070
TO GIVE THANKS

174
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:09,116
THAT WE UNDESERVED
SPOILERS OF THIS PLANET

175
00:14:09,116 --> 00:14:13,495
CAN ENJOY THIS RICH BOUNTY.

176
00:14:13,495 --> 00:14:15,622
THOUGH OTHERS MAY BE COLD,

177
00:14:15,622 --> 00:14:19,168
HUGRY, HOMELESS, AND DISEASED...

178
00:14:19,168 --> 00:14:23,172
WE MUST REMEMBER
IN THE MIDST OF THIS RICHNESS

179
00:14:23,172 --> 00:14:27,092
THAT THE APPEARANCE OF GOODNESS

180
00:14:27,092 --> 00:14:31,972
IS NOT ALWAYS WHAT IT SEEMS.

181
00:14:31,972 --> 00:14:32,639
THE SCRIPTURES WARN US

182
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,185
THAT BENEATH THE SHINING SKIN OF TH RIPE FRUIT

183
00:14:36,185 --> 00:14:39,646
LIES PESTILENCE,
VERMIN, AND ROT.

184
00:14:39,646 --> 00:14:42,274

185
00:14:42,274 --> 00:14:43,901
WE THANK YOU
FOR YOU KIDNESS

186
00:14:43,901 --> 00:14:45,277
IN GIVING US,

187
00:14:45,277 --> 00:14:47,112
UNDESERVED
AS W MAY BE,

188
00:14:47,112 --> 00:14:48,697
THIS FINE FEAST.

189
00:14:49,907 --> 00:14:51,783
AMEN.

190
00:14:51,783 --> 00:14:53,785
AMEN.
AMEN.

191
00:15:08,383 --> 00:15:11,595
AH, IS THAT, UH,
FRESH CORN?

192
00:15:11,595 --> 00:15:13,263
IT'S ACTUALLY CORN
FROM UNCLE GEORGE'S FARM.

193
00:15:13,263 --> 00:15:14,890
AH.

194
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:17,100
BUT THIS IS THE LAST YEAR
WE'LL BE HAVING THIS.

195
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,602
CLAIRE.

196
00:15:18,602 --> 00:15:20,896
I'M JUST SAYING
I'LL MISS IT, THAT'S ALL.

197
00:15:20,896 --> 00:15:22,773
THOSE CROPS HAVE BEEN AMAZING.

198
00:15:22,773 --> 00:15:25,651
YEAR IN, YEAR OUT,
IT'S THE BEST FIELD IN THE COUNTY,

199
00:15:25,651 --> 00:15:26,735
DESPITE DROUGHTS, OR FREEZE

200
00:15:26,735 --> 00:15:28,946
CLAIRE, IF YOU'RE SO DAMN SENTIMENTAL,

201
00:15:28,946 --> 00:15:34,368
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?
- COME ON, COME ON, GUYS.WE'LL ALL MISS THE FARM.

202
00:15:34,368 --> 00:15:36,537
BUT, UH, IT'S WORTH IT.

203
00:15:36,537 --> 00:15:38,413
AND IT'S GREAT HAVING CLAIRE BACK.

204
00:15:38,413 --> 00:15:40,791
YEAH, SO LET'S CUT THE CRAP

205
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:42,751
AND START STUFFING OUR FACES.

206
00:17:01,997 --> 00:17:04,291
O.K., JACK, LET'S HAVE
OUR NEXT CONTESTANT.

207
00:18:01,056 --> 00:18:02,391
GOING OUT?

208
00:18:02,391 --> 00:18:03,892
I TOLD UNCLE GEORGE

209
00:18:03,892 --> 00:18:06,270
I'D STOP BY BEFORE IT GOT LATE.

210
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:07,479
IS THAT TRUE?

211
00:18:07,479 --> 00:18:08,522
JESUS, DAD.

212
00:18:39,178 --> 00:18:40,804
SON OF A BITCH!

213
00:18:58,655 --> 00:19:01,825
AHH, THERE YOU ARE.

214
00:19:03,535 --> 00:19:05,496
SMART SON OF A BITC, HUH?

215
00:19:24,181 --> 00:19:25,891
I KNOW YOU' RE IN HERE, ASSHOLE!

216
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:46,954
ALL RIGHT, YOU SON OF A BITCH.

217
00:20:37,171 --> 00:20:38,589
WHAT THE...

218
00:21:28,138 --> 00:21:29,598
OH, NO!

219
00:22:02,256 --> 00:22:03,591
UNCLE GEORGE!

220
00:22:50,054 --> 00:22:51,805
I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND

221
00:22:51,805 --> 00:22:54,350
WHY GEORGE WOULD PICK
A TIME LIKE THAT

222
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:56,727
TO WORK ON HIS DAMN MACHINE.

223
00:22:56,727 --> 00:22:59,355
FRANK, GEORGE WAS DRUNK.

224
00:22:59,355 --> 00:23:01,273
HE'D BEEN DRINKING LIKE THAT

225
00:23:01,273 --> 00:23:02,816
EVER SINCE DOROTHY DIED.

226
00:23:02,816 --> 00:23:05,110
I MEAN, AN ACCIDENT LIKE THIS

227
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:06,862
WAS BOUND TO HAPPEN.

228
00:23:06,862 --> 00:23:08,572
YEAH.
I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT.

229
00:23:08,572 --> 00:23:11,158
UNCLE FRANK,
I HAVE SOMETHING TO TELL YOU.

230
00:23:11,158 --> 00:23:13,661
GOING INTO THE BARN,
I SAW SOMETHING.

231
00:23:13,661 --> 00:23:14,995
WHAT?

232
00:23:14,995 --> 00:23:16,455
I'M NOT SURE.

233
00:23:16,455 --> 00:23:18,749
I THOUGHT IT WAS A MAN

234
00:23:18,749 --> 00:23:20,209
STANDING ON
THE CORNFIELD'S EDGE.

235
00:23:20,209 --> 00:23:22,169
WHAT DID HE LOOK LIKE?

236
00:23:22,169 --> 00:23:25,339
HE WAS TALL.
HE WAS WEARING

237
00:23:25,339 --> 00:23:27,967
LIKE SOME
BIZARRE COSTUME,

238
00:23:27,967 --> 00:23:31,554
AND THEN IT WAS LIKE
HE WASN'T A MAN.

239
00:23:31,554 --> 00:23:34,014
WHAT DO YOU MEAN...

240
00:23:34,014 --> 00:23:36,308
WASN'T A MAN?

241
00:23:36,308 --> 00:23:39,270
I DON'T KNOW.
HE MOVED SO STRANGE.

242
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:44,233
AND I WAS LOOKING AT HIM,
AND THEN HE WAS JUST GONE.

243
00:23:44,233 --> 00:23:46,318
CLAIRE, YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH A LOT.

244
00:23:46,318 --> 00:23:50,281
YOU NEED SOME REST.
LET'S JUST GET ON...

245
00:23:50,281 --> 00:23:51,532
FRANK.

246
00:23:53,576 --> 00:23:55,119
FRANK?

247
00:23:57,454 --> 00:23:59,165
JUST GET OUT TO THE CAR.

248
00:23:59,165 --> 00:24:01,709
COME ON.
LET'S GO.

249
00:24:09,008 --> 00:24:11,427
WHAT THE HELL
YOU TRYING TO DO?

250
00:24:11,427 --> 00:24:12,845
SHE'S BEEN THROUGH A LOT.

251
00:24:12,845 --> 00:24:14,346
I'M THE SHERIFF, BILL!

252
00:24:14,346 --> 00:24:15,931
SHE MIGHT'VE SEEN SOMETHING.

253
00:24:15,931 --> 00:24:18,225
I GOT TO CHECK IT OUT.
I'M A COP.

254
00:24:18,225 --> 00:24:19,643
FRANK, DON'T!

255
00:24:19,643 --> 00:24:21,687
I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL.

256
00:24:21,687 --> 00:24:24,148
YOU WANT TO BELIEVE
THERE'S SOMETHING YOU CAN DO.

257
00:24:24,148 --> 00:24:25,900
BUT BEING A GOOD COP

258
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,610
ISN'T GOING TO BRING
GEORGE BACK.

259
00:24:30,279 --> 00:24:31,947
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

260
00:24:31,947 --> 00:24:34,158
WHAT THE HELL ELSE
COULD IT BE?

261
00:24:42,625 --> 00:24:43,959
OH, LORD.

262
00:24:45,419 --> 00:24:46,587
SWEET JESUS.

263
00:24:56,138 --> 00:24:58,808
GOD PROTECT US.

264
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:39,598
HOW DO YOU FEEL?

265
00:25:39,598 --> 00:25:41,350
GROGGY.

266
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:44,562
THAT PILL YOU GAVE ME
REALLY KNOCKED ME OUT.

267
00:25:46,063 --> 00:25:47,565
OH, GOD.

268
00:25:47,565 --> 00:25:49,775
I'VE BEEN OUT ALL DAY.

269
00:25:49,775 --> 00:25:51,277
THAT'S GOOD.
NEEDED THE REST.

270
00:25:53,571 --> 00:25:55,322
SWEETHEART, LOOK,

271
00:25:55,322 --> 00:25:57,616
ABOUT WHAT YOU THOUGHT YOU SAW,

272
00:25:57,616 --> 00:25:59,326
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

273
00:25:59,326 --> 00:26:00,828
YOU WERE JUST UPSET.

274
00:26:00,828 --> 00:26:02,204
YOUR MIND WAS
PLAYING TRICKS ON YOU.

275
00:26:02,204 --> 00:26:04,707
I KNOW I SAW SOMETHING.

276
00:26:04,707 --> 00:26:07,126
NOTHING CAN BRING GEORGE BACK.

277
00:26:07,126 --> 00:26:08,669
WHAT IF IT WASN'T AN ACCIDENT?

278
00:26:08,669 --> 00:26:10,087
IT WAS.

279
00:26:10,087 --> 00:26:11,964
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.

280
00:26:11,964 --> 00:26:13,966
YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT ME
EMBARRASSING YOU.

281
00:26:13,966 --> 00:26:16,010
IT'S NOT JUST YOU.

282
00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:18,637
THIS WHOLE TOWN IS SO CONCERNED
WITH APPEARANCES,

283
00:26:18,637 --> 00:26:21,348
LIKE THEY'RE PROTECTING SOME
NASTY LITTLE SECRET.

284
00:26:21,348 --> 00:26:23,726
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
TALKING ABOUT, GIRL.

285
00:26:26,771 --> 00:26:29,398
CLAIRE, DON'T GO OUT.

286
00:26:29,398 --> 00:26:32,818
RIGHT NOW I THINK I JUST
NEED SOME FRESH AIR.

287
00:26:32,818 --> 00:26:34,195
SWEETHEART, I...

288
00:26:34,195 --> 00:26:36,363
I DON'T THINK YOU OUGHT
TO GO OUT ALONE.

289
00:26:36,363 --> 00:26:38,407
WHY? IT'S PERFECTLY SAFE...

290
00:26:38,407 --> 00:26:41,118
UNLESS I HAVE AN ACCIDENT.

291
00:26:41,118 --> 00:26:42,453
RIGHT?

292
00:27:28,374 --> 00:27:30,292
AAH! DILLON.

293
00:27:30,292 --> 00:27:32,420
YOU LOOK LIKE
YOU SAW A GHOST.

294
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:37,299
WERE YOU BACK THERE FOLLOWING ME?
NO, WAIT, SOMEBODY'S FOLLOWING YOU?

295
00:27:37,299 --> 00:27:39,385
I DON'T SEE ANYBODY.

296
00:27:39,385 --> 00:27:41,095
I THINK I NEED A DRINK.

297
00:27:54,233 --> 00:27:55,443
HEY, DANNY.

298
00:27:57,153 --> 00:27:59,530
HEY, WHAT?

299
00:27:59,530 --> 00:28:00,906
LOOK WHO JUST WALKED IN.

300
00:28:04,702 --> 00:28:06,328
HEY, CLAIRE.

301
00:28:08,748 --> 00:28:10,041
HEY, DILLON.

302
00:28:10,041 --> 00:28:12,084
YOU LOOKING FOR ME?

303
00:28:12,084 --> 00:28:14,587
WANT TO MAYBE FINISH WHAT YOU
STARTED YESTERDAY?

304
00:28:14,587 --> 00:28:16,881
NO, NO, BUT YOU KNOW,

305
00:28:16,881 --> 00:28:19,592
SOMEONE WAS MIXING IT UP
WITH ONE OF MY GRADERS.

306
00:28:19,592 --> 00:28:21,552
LEFT IT IN THE FIELD.

307
00:28:21,552 --> 00:28:24,597
YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT THAT, DO YOU?

308
00:28:24,597 --> 00:28:25,765
ARE YOU ACCUSING ME?

309
00:28:28,768 --> 00:28:30,269
HMM?

310
00:28:32,146 --> 00:28:36,192
JESUS, WHAT IS THE LEGAL DRINKING AGE
AROUND HERE, 10?

311
00:28:42,281 --> 00:28:44,158
LET'S GO, MAN.

312
00:28:44,158 --> 00:28:45,785
HEY!

313
00:28:45,785 --> 00:28:47,328
MY UNCLE'S DEAD!

314
00:28:47,328 --> 00:28:49,038
SHOW SOME RESPECT.

315
00:28:50,623 --> 00:28:51,999
CLAIRE.

316
00:28:51,999 --> 00:28:53,125
COME ON.
COME ON.

317
00:28:55,961 --> 00:28:57,797
SEE YOU AROUND, DILLON.

318
00:28:57,797 --> 00:29:00,299
OH, YEAH, YOU'RE GOING
TO SEE ME AROUND.

319
00:29:00,299 --> 00:29:01,926
COUNT ON IT.

320
00:29:01,926 --> 00:29:03,219
I'M COUNTING ON IT.

321
00:29:29,912 --> 00:29:31,205
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

322
00:29:31,205 --> 00:29:33,374
YES.

323
00:29:33,374 --> 00:29:36,502
- I'LL SEE YOU IN A WHILE.
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

324
00:29:36,502 --> 00:29:39,046
TO THE CHURCH.

325
00:29:39,046 --> 00:29:41,340
I NEED TO MAKE ARRANGEMENTS.

326
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:43,092
POOR GEORGE.

327
00:29:44,969 --> 00:29:47,054
FUNERAL SERVICES.

328
00:29:48,055 --> 00:29:50,057
STEPHANIE...

329
00:29:50,057 --> 00:29:53,185
WOULD YOU LIKE TO COME
TO CHURCH WITH ME?

330
00:29:53,185 --> 00:29:54,812
UM, NO. THANKS, DAD.

331
00:29:54,812 --> 00:29:57,189
I'M GOING TO GO TO BED.

332
00:29:57,189 --> 00:29:58,733
I'M REALLY TIRED.

333
00:29:58,733 --> 00:30:00,610
COME OVER HERE, CHILD.

334
00:30:06,907 --> 00:30:10,870
THIS ARRIVED IN THE MAIL FOR YOU TODAY.

335
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:14,290
I AM NOT TOO HAPPY ABOUT THIS.

336
00:30:15,708 --> 00:30:17,835
WE NEED TO HAVE A TALK.

337
00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:23,507
GOOD NIGHT, FATHER.

338
00:30:23,507 --> 00:30:24,884
GOOD NIGHT.

339
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:57,124
OH, YES.

340
00:31:15,351 --> 00:31:19,063
THADDEUS?

341
00:31:21,357 --> 00:31:24,193
THADDEUS...

342
00:31:31,242 --> 00:31:32,785
COME TO ME.

343
00:31:42,795 --> 00:31:45,006
COME TO ME, THADDEUS.

344
00:31:49,302 --> 00:31:53,848
HA HA!

345
00:31:53,848 --> 00:31:55,099
I'M WAITING FOR YOU.

346
00:31:59,979 --> 00:32:01,647
WHO'S THERE?

347
00:32:01,647 --> 00:32:03,149
YOU KNOW WHO I AM.

348
00:32:03,149 --> 00:32:04,400
SHOW YOURSELF.

349
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,903
YOU WANT TO SEE ME?

350
00:32:06,903 --> 00:32:08,654
THIS IS THE HOUSE OF GOD.

351
00:32:11,073 --> 00:32:14,452
THIS IS NOT THE PLACE FOR FORNICATION.

352
00:32:18,456 --> 00:32:22,543
FASTER, THADDEUS.

353
00:32:22,543 --> 00:32:26,964
YOU THINK YOU CAN TEMPT ME?

354
00:32:47,693 --> 00:32:49,779
SWEET JESUS,

355
00:32:49,779 --> 00:32:51,989
FORGIVE ME, LORD,

356
00:32:51,989 --> 00:32:57,703
FOR DISGRACING AND DISHONORING
THIS HOLY PLACE.

357
00:32:57,703 --> 00:32:59,789
SWEET JESUS.

358
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:19,684
IT'S TRUE.

359
00:33:19,684 --> 00:33:21,853
SINS OF THE FATHER.

360
00:33:21,853 --> 00:33:23,479
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?

361
00:33:23,479 --> 00:33:26,691
WHAT?
SPEAK!

362
00:33:28,442 --> 00:33:30,319
SPEAK.

363
00:33:30,319 --> 00:33:33,489
OH, JESUS, HELP ME!

364
00:33:33,489 --> 00:33:35,241
HOLY FATHER.

365
00:33:35,241 --> 00:33:37,201
THE LORD IS MY SHEPHERD,

366
00:33:37,201 --> 00:33:38,411
I SHALL NOT WANT.

367
00:33:38,411 --> 00:33:41,122
HE MAKETH ME
TO LIE DOWN IN...

368
00:33:41,122 --> 00:33:42,623
SHALL NOT WANT.

369
00:33:42,623 --> 00:33:47,879
I SHALL NOT PERISH.
WHERE IS MY BOOK?

370
00:33:47,879 --> 00:33:50,339
HELP ME.

371
00:33:50,339 --> 00:33:56,137
SPEAK NOW OR...

372
00:33:56,137 --> 00:33:58,639
NEVER.

373
00:34:06,522 --> 00:34:08,483
NO!

374
00:35:05,790 --> 00:35:08,334
OH.

375
00:35:08,334 --> 00:35:09,460
SHALL WE SIT?

376
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:25,643
THANKS FOR HELPING ME
GET THROUGH NIGHT.

377
00:35:27,603 --> 00:35:30,148
WELL, YOU KNOW, THE, UM...

378
00:35:30,148 --> 00:35:37,488
NIGHT'S NOT EXACTLY OVER.
I DON'T EVEN KNOW YOU YET.

379
00:35:37,488 --> 00:35:40,283
TELL ME WHAT YOU WANT FROM LIFE.

380
00:35:40,283 --> 00:35:42,785
I'M LOOKING FOR WHAT
EVERYBODY ELSE IS--

381
00:35:42,785 --> 00:35:45,288
SOMEBODY WHO'LL BE THERE
IN THE MORNING.

382
00:35:45,288 --> 00:35:47,457
THAT SHOULDN'T BE TOO HARD TO FIND.

383
00:35:47,457 --> 00:35:49,167
YOU'D BE SURPRISED.

384
00:35:49,167 --> 00:35:53,129
I'M JUST NOT THE KIND OF GUY
THAT WOMEN STICK AROUND WITH.

385
00:35:53,129 --> 00:35:54,547
YOU KNOW...

386
00:35:54,547 --> 00:35:57,383
THEY USE ME,
THEN THEY LOSE ME.

387
00:35:57,383 --> 00:36:00,011
OH, FROM WHAT I HEAR.

388
00:36:00,011 --> 00:36:01,763
THAT'S WHAT EVERY GUY
WANTS FROM LIFE.

389
00:36:01,763 --> 00:36:04,098
I GUESS I'M NOT EVERY GUY.

390
00:36:04,098 --> 00:36:05,349
NO.

391
00:36:06,893 --> 00:36:08,394
YOU'RE NOT.

392
00:36:12,273 --> 00:36:14,734
LUCKY THING FOR YOU
I CAME INTO TOWN.

393
00:36:14,734 --> 00:36:15,902
REALLY?

394
00:36:15,902 --> 00:36:17,445
HOW LUCKY?

395
00:36:17,445 --> 00:36:19,739
I HAVEN'T DECIDED YET.

396
00:36:19,739 --> 00:36:22,158
HOW LONG DOES IT
USUALLY TAKE YOU?

397
00:36:22,158 --> 00:36:23,659
DEPENDS ON THE GUY.

398
00:36:35,755 --> 00:36:37,256
O.K.

399
00:36:37,256 --> 00:36:40,176
I'VE MADE UP MY MIND.

400
00:36:50,728 --> 00:36:53,106
NO.

401
00:36:56,734 --> 00:36:57,902
DON'T.

402
00:36:59,195 --> 00:37:00,321
STOP.

403
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:03,908
I SAID STOP!

404
00:37:05,159 --> 00:37:06,202
WHY?

405
00:37:08,162 --> 00:37:12,583
BECAUSE MY MOM
IS STILL AWAKE, YOU IDIOT.

406
00:37:12,583 --> 00:37:14,043
IT GETS YOU HOT,
DOESN'T IT?

407
00:37:28,391 --> 00:37:30,101
LET'S GO OUT.

408
00:37:30,101 --> 00:37:32,854
SOMEPLACE WHERE
NO ONE CAN HEAR US.

409
00:37:32,854 --> 00:37:38,359
SOMEPLACE ROMANTIC.
I GUESS THAT'D BE OK.

410
00:37:47,869 --> 00:37:49,954
YOU GOT A COUPLE BUCKS
FOR BEERS?

411
00:37:49,954 --> 00:37:51,581
Shut up.

412
00:37:51,581 --> 00:37:53,249
My mother's going to hear us.

413
00:38:27,742 --> 00:38:29,577
SIT TIGHT, BABE.

414
00:38:29,577 --> 00:38:32,997
I GOT TO GET ME
A TALL COOL ONE.

415
00:38:32,997 --> 00:38:35,500
I THOUGHT THAT'S WHAT I WAS.

416
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:37,335
NO, YOU'RE THE SHORT HOT ONE.

417
00:38:42,048 --> 00:38:44,092
YOU'RE SUCH A PIG!

418
00:39:11,953 --> 00:39:14,747
OH!

419
00:39:33,516 --> 00:39:35,476
IT'S ABOUT TIME YOU GOT BACK.

420
00:39:46,904 --> 00:39:54,537
YOU WILL CLEANSE MY SEED.

421
00:40:17,518 --> 00:40:18,895
GOD.

422
00:40:18,895 --> 00:40:21,356
WHAT THE FUCK?

423
00:40:36,704 --> 00:40:38,164
STEPH.

424
00:40:48,049 --> 00:40:49,801
DANNY.

425
00:40:49,801 --> 00:40:50,593
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

426
00:40:50,593 --> 00:40:52,053
DANNY.

427
00:40:52,053 --> 00:40:57,892
WHAT?

428
00:41:24,836 --> 00:41:26,254
GOD!

429
00:41:53,114 --> 00:41:54,866
DANNY!

430
00:42:36,157 --> 00:42:37,408
HEY!

431
00:42:41,246 --> 00:42:42,872
HEY!

432
00:42:51,256 --> 00:42:52,549
JESUS CHRIST.

433
00:42:53,591 --> 00:42:54,759
JESUS CHRIST.

434
00:42:57,345 --> 00:42:58,429
JESUS CHRIST.

435
00:43:03,101 --> 00:43:06,020
FUCK.
JESUS.

436
00:43:14,237 --> 00:43:18,158
WELL, HEY, THERE.

437
00:43:22,912 --> 00:43:25,874
CAN'T SEEM
TO FIND THE BODY.

438
00:43:25,874 --> 00:43:29,002
DANNY THOMPSON'S VAN
WAS FOUND WITH BLOOD ALL OVER IT.

439
00:43:29,002 --> 00:43:30,628
HIS BODY WAS TORN APART

440
00:43:30,628 --> 00:43:32,755
LIKE SOMETHING INHUMAN GOTTEN HOLD OF HIM.

441
00:43:32,755 --> 00:43:34,674
THIS IS OUT OF CONTROL.

442
00:43:34,674 --> 00:43:36,384
DAMN RIGHT.
TWO, MAYBE THREE MURDERS

443
00:43:36,384 --> 00:43:38,219
IN THE LAST TWO NIGHTS.

444
00:43:38,219 --> 00:43:40,847
IT'S NOT BEING DONE
BY A HOMELESS MAN.

445
00:43:40,847 --> 00:43:42,891
NOT BY A MAN AT ALL.

446
00:43:42,891 --> 00:43:44,559
GET AHOLD OF YOURSELF.

447
00:43:44,559 --> 00:43:46,227
YOU'RE SOUNDING LIKE THADDEUS.

448
00:43:46,227 --> 00:43:49,272
I DON'T CARE.
I'M TRYING TO DO MY JOB.

449
00:43:49,272 --> 00:43:51,941
THEN STOP LISTENING
TO GHOST STORIES.

450
00:43:51,941 --> 00:43:54,903
GO AFTER THE OBVIOUS HUMAN SUSPECT.

451
00:43:54,903 --> 00:43:58,198
WHO WOULD THAT BE?
THAT'D BE DILLON HALE.

452
00:43:58,198 --> 00:44:01,451
YOU SAW THE FIGHT HE HAD WITH DANNY YESTERDAY.

453
00:44:01,451 --> 00:44:03,620
BEN TELLS ME THEY
DAMN NEAR GOT INTO IT

454
00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:05,121
TONIGHT AT THE TAVERN.

455
00:44:05,121 --> 00:44:07,582
THAT'S REAL CONVINCING
EVIDENCE, ISN'T IT?

456
00:44:11,169 --> 00:44:13,463
FRANK, SIT DOWN.

457
00:44:23,264 --> 00:44:26,935
AS ALWAYS, LET ME
SPELL IT OUT FOR YOU.

458
00:44:26,935 --> 00:44:28,603
YOU'RE THE SHERIFF HERE

459
00:44:28,603 --> 00:44:31,815
BECAUSE I'M DAMN MAYOR.

460
00:44:31,815 --> 00:44:34,984
NOW I'M ABOUT TO CLOSE
THE BIGGEST LAND DEAL

461
00:44:34,984 --> 00:44:36,945
IN THIS TOWN'S HISTORY,

462
00:44:36,945 --> 00:44:38,655
AND WE CAN'T AFFORD

463
00:44:38,655 --> 00:44:40,657
TO LOOK LIKE A BUNCH OF HICKS

464
00:44:40,657 --> 00:44:42,575
LETTING MURDERERS
RUN AROUND LOOSE

465
00:44:42,575 --> 00:44:46,913
OR MONSTERS, SO YOU DO YOUR DAMN JOB,
LITTLE BROTHER.

466
00:44:46,913 --> 00:44:57,757
YOU ARREST THE SON OF A BITCH AND CLOSE THE CASE.
YOU KNOW WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE TO ME, BIG BROTHER?

467
00:44:57,757 --> 00:44:58,800
THAN YOUR FAMILY.

468
00:45:29,706 --> 00:45:32,542
WHAT'RE YOU DOING?
WHERE YOU GOING?

469
00:45:32,542 --> 00:45:35,128
I DON'T KNOW.
SOMETHING FEELS WEIRD WITH MY FAMILY.

470
00:45:35,128 --> 00:45:37,213
I DON'T KNOW WHAT.
I GOT TO GO.

471
00:45:37,213 --> 00:45:38,590
ALL RIGHT.

472
00:45:38,590 --> 00:45:40,175
I'M GOING WITH YOU.

473
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:47,223
OH, MY GOD!
JESUS! WHAT...

474
00:45:52,896 --> 00:45:54,189
DO IT.

475
00:45:55,607 --> 00:45:56,983
HOLD STILL.

476
00:46:03,948 --> 00:46:05,200
I'M ALMOST DONE.

477
00:46:09,496 --> 00:46:10,830
THIS IS THE LAST ONE.

478
00:46:28,348 --> 00:46:32,727
THANK YOU.

479
00:46:32,727 --> 00:46:34,062
HERE'S SOME WATER.
DRINK SOME.

480
00:46:42,112 --> 00:46:44,739
WHO DID THIS TO YOU?

481
00:46:44,739 --> 00:46:48,451
IT'S NOT SAFE HERE.

482
00:46:48,451 --> 00:46:51,371
FO YOU?

483
00:46:51,371 --> 00:46:52,872
FOR ANY OF US.

484
00:46:54,249 --> 00:46:56,501
FOR...

485
00:46:56,501 --> 00:46:57,794
BARBARA.

486
00:47:01,131 --> 00:47:03,800
BARBARA.

487
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:07,512
- WHAT IS GOING ON?
- WHERE'S STEPHANIE?

488
00:47:09,639 --> 00:47:11,516
HAS HE TAKEN MY DAUGHTER?

489
00:47:11,516 --> 00:47:13,101
HAS HE CLAIMED HER?

490
00:47:16,438 --> 00:47:18,148
OF COURSE HE HAS.

491
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:23,486
SHE WILL NOT BE SPARED.

492
00:47:26,323 --> 00:47:28,283
NONE OF US WILL.

493
00:47:29,826 --> 00:47:32,662
NONE OF US WILL!

494
00:47:32,662 --> 00:47:34,039
TELL ME WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

495
00:47:36,124 --> 00:47:37,667
HE...

496
00:47:37,667 --> 00:47:39,711
HAS...

497
00:47:39,711 --> 00:47:41,379
COME BACK.

498
00:47:41,379 --> 00:47:44,966
WHO HAS COME BACK?
COME BACK FOR WHAT?

499
00:47:44,966 --> 00:47:49,596
FOR GENERATIONS
WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO FORGET

500
00:47:49,596 --> 00:47:52,182
WHEN WE SHOULD HAVE REMEBERED...

501
00:47:52,182 --> 00:47:55,268
PREPARED...

502
00:47:55,268 --> 00:47:56,895
PRAYED.

503
00:47:58,730 --> 00:48:00,315
OH, GOD, PLEASE.

504
00:48:02,859 --> 00:48:06,154
IT ALL BEGAN OVER 100 YEARS AGO

505
00:48:06,154 --> 00:48:10,200
WHEN THE GOODMANS FOUNDED THIS TOWN.

506
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:12,911
THEY CAME WEST LOOKING FOR A BETTER LIFE,

507
00:48:12,911 --> 00:48:16,790
AND WHEN THEY ARRIVED HERE,
THEY FOUND MORE HARDSHIP.

508
00:48:16,790 --> 00:48:18,500
DROUGHT...

509
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:19,751
FROST...

510
00:48:19,751 --> 00:48:21,002
PESTILENCE...

511
00:48:21,002 --> 00:48:23,088
THE GROUND WAS HARD,

512
00:48:23,088 --> 00:48:32,097
SOIL VOID OF NUTRIMENTS.
PEOPLE WERE STARVING.

513
00:48:33,807 --> 00:48:35,976
OLD...

514
00:48:35,976 --> 00:48:38,645
OLD SILAS GOODMAN

515
00:48:38,645 --> 00:48:40,355
WAS THEIR SPIRITUAL LEADER.

516
00:48:42,023 --> 00:48:47,237
THE PEOPLE CAME TO HIM
AND ASKED FOR HIS HELP,

517
00:48:47,237 --> 00:48:49,739
BUT THERE WAS NOTHING
HE COULD DO.

518
00:48:51,032 --> 00:48:56,329
AND THEN THIS STRANGER CAME.

519
00:48:58,039 --> 00:49:00,709
HE WAS A MAN OF MAGIC...

520
00:49:02,335 --> 00:49:05,255
A MAN OF EVIL.

521
00:49:05,255 --> 00:49:10,176
IN HANFORD HE SAW
A LAND OF OPPORTUNITY.

522
00:49:10,176 --> 00:49:13,471
HE CAME TO SILAS
AND OFFERED HIM

523
00:49:13,471 --> 00:49:16,683
A SOLUTION, A BARGAIN.

524
00:49:16,683 --> 00:49:19,936
HE WOULD MAKE
THE EARTH FERTILE,

525
00:49:19,936 --> 00:49:23,189
THE WELLS RUN RICH,

526
00:49:23,189 --> 00:49:28,695
THE WEATHER TEMPERATE,
THE CROPS GROW BOUNTIFUL.

527
00:49:28,695 --> 00:49:30,822
THE PRICE WAS SIMPLE.

528
00:49:30,822 --> 00:49:34,242
IN THIS TOWN, THE WARLOCK
WOULD HAVE COMPLETE FREEDOM,

529
00:49:34,242 --> 00:49:36,995
FREEDOM FROM PERSECUTION,
FREEDOM TO DO AS HE LIKED.

530
00:49:36,995 --> 00:49:38,038
FREEDOM.

531
00:49:40,749 --> 00:49:45,629
AT FIRST ALL WENT WELL.
THE TOWN PROSPERED.

532
00:49:45,629 --> 00:49:50,050
AND THE WARLOCK'S PRESENCE
SEEMED HARMLESS,

533
00:49:50,050 --> 00:49:52,928
BUT SILAS GOODMAN
WAS A GOD-FEARING MAN.

534
00:49:55,055 --> 00:49:58,225
HE KNEW HE HAD MADE
A PACT WITH THE DEVIL...

535
00:50:02,312 --> 00:50:04,272
A DEVIL HE COULD NOT CONTROL.

536
00:50:06,983 --> 00:50:10,403
THE WARLOCK WAS A HEDONIST
OF THE FIRST ORDER.

537
00:50:12,614 --> 00:50:14,699
HE TOOK OVER THE TOWN,

538
00:50:14,699 --> 00:50:18,828
NOT BY FORCE BUT BY PLEASURE.

539
00:50:21,289 --> 00:50:31,299
HE LURED THE YOUNG GIRLS INTO WITCHES' SABBATHS,
WHICH TURNED OUT TO BE NOTHING WILD ORGIES.

540
00:51:03,373 --> 00:51:08,003
HE EVEN SEDUCED
SILAS' OWN DAUGHTER.

541
00:51:15,427 --> 00:51:18,805
SILAS DECIDED IT WAS TIME TO STOP THIS...

542
00:51:20,515 --> 00:51:22,475
NO MATTER THE PRICE...

543
00:51:25,228 --> 00:51:28,440
AND STOLE HIS BOOK OF MAGIC SPELLS...

544
00:51:30,901 --> 00:51:35,155
AND TURNED HIS OWN MAGIC AGAINST HIM.

545
00:51:38,867 --> 00:51:43,288
ONE NIGHT SILAS DRUGGED THE WARLOCK.

546
00:51:54,799 --> 00:51:59,054
AT DAWN SILAS AND THE TOWNSPEOPLE

547
00:51:59,054 --> 00:52:01,389
DRAGGED THE DEMON OUT TO THE FIELD.

548
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:08,271
THEY'D CUT A STONE SLAB
THAT WOULD SEAL HIS TOMB.

549
00:52:18,198 --> 00:52:21,618
THEY CHOPPED A PATH
DEEP INTO THE CORN.

550
00:52:24,204 --> 00:52:26,289
WHEN THE WARLOCK REALIZED
WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN,

551
00:52:26,289 --> 00:52:28,166
HE STARTED TO SCREAM AND THREATEN...

552
00:52:31,378 --> 00:52:34,005
EVEN AS THEY LASHED HIM
TO THE CROSS,

553
00:52:34,005 --> 00:52:36,883
AND CRUCIFIED HIM.

554
00:52:45,934 --> 00:52:52,149
IT TOOK THE WARLOCK
TWO SCREAMING DAYS

555
00:52:52,149 --> 00:52:55,026
TO FINALLY DIE.

556
00:53:00,657 --> 00:53:02,325
OUR PEOPLE BURNED THE BODY,

557
00:53:02,325 --> 00:53:06,580
PUT HIS CHARRED BONES
INTO THE SPECIAL CASKET,

558
00:53:06,580 --> 00:53:09,291
BURYING THEM DEEP INTO THE GROUND.

559
00:53:09,291 --> 00:53:12,210
AS LONG AS THE BONES
REMAINED UNDISTURBED,

560
00:53:12,210 --> 00:53:14,963
THE PEOPLE OF HANFORD WOULD BE ASSURED

561
00:53:14,963 --> 00:53:17,215
RICH HARVEST FOR ALL TIME.

562
00:53:17,215 --> 00:53:20,760
EACH GENERATION
WOULD ERECT A SCARECROW

563
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:22,721
AS A REMINDER.

564
00:53:24,931 --> 00:53:31,021
OUR ANCESTORS THOUGHT THIS
TOMB WAS SEALED FOREVER,

565
00:53:31,021 --> 00:53:35,400
BUT NOW SOMEHOW
THE WARLOCK'S SPIRIT HAS ESCAPED,

566
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:39,488
AS IF WE'D BROUGHT THE EVIL ON OURSELVES.

567
00:53:39,488 --> 00:53:42,199
SO HOW DO WE STOP IT?

568
00:53:42,199 --> 00:53:46,787
THE SECRET IS IN HIS BOOK OF SPELLS.

569
00:53:46,787 --> 00:53:48,830
IT WAS GIVEN TO YOUR FATHER

570
00:53:48,830 --> 00:53:50,999
AS FIRST-BORN OF OUR GENERATION.

571
00:53:50,999 --> 00:53:54,127
WHAT HE'S DONE WITH IT,
I DON'T NOW.

572
00:53:54,127 --> 00:53:57,672
THE SPELL THAT WOULD
DESTROY THE WARLOCK

573
00:53:57,672 --> 00:53:59,549
IS IN THAT BOOK.

574
00:53:59,549 --> 00:54:03,136
OK, DILLON, YOU BETTER GET HIM HOME.

575
00:54:03,136 --> 00:54:05,514
I'M GOING TO MY FATHER'S AND FIND THE BOOK

576
00:54:05,514 --> 00:54:08,225
I'LL GET YOUR UNCLE HOME,

577
00:54:08,225 --> 00:54:09,476
AND YOU BE CAREFUL.

578
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:13,647
THADDEUS, TELL ME.

579
00:54:13,647 --> 00:54:16,525
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN
IF HE FINDS THE BOOK?

580
00:54:18,652 --> 00:54:24,574
HE CAN REUNITE HIS SPIRIT WITH FLESH.

581
00:54:24,574 --> 00:54:28,453
HE WILL BECOME HUMAN AGAIN.

582
00:54:29,913 --> 00:54:32,541
IF THAT HAPPENS,

583
00:54:32,541 --> 00:54:34,042
NO ONE...

584
00:54:34,042 --> 00:54:38,213
NO ONE CAN STOP HIS POWER.

585
00:54:39,297 --> 00:54:40,590
NO ONE.

586
00:55:08,076 --> 00:55:08,744

587
00:55:20,672 --> 00:55:23,675

588
00:55:42,402 --> 00:55:48,008

589
00:56:05,092 --> 00:56:10,597
WHERE IS MY BOOK?
GO FUCK YOURSELF.

I WANT YOU TO SYMPATHIZE WITH ME.

592

01:09:42,952 --> 01:09:44,954
FIRE.

729
01:09:44,954 --> 01:09:46,705
I GOT SOMETHING BETTER THAN THAT.

730
01:09:49,625 --> 01:09:53,170
THIS SHIT WILL MELT THROUGH ROCK
AT ROOM TEMPERATURE.

731
01:09:53,170 --> 01:09:54,880
LIQUIDATE THAT FUCKING BASTARD.

732
01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:57,424
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
GET THAT HATCHET.

01:10:14,275 --> 01:10:15,276
GET THROUGH!

734
01:10:33,085 --> 01:10:34,628
THE TOMB'S IN THE CENTER OF THE CORNFIELD.

735
01:11:12,416 --> 01:11:14,001
GIVE ME THE FLASHLIGHT.

736
01:11:14,001 --> 01:11:15,753
HOLD MY LEGS.
HOLD MY LEGS.

737
01:11:19,048 --> 01:11:20,299
I CAN'T HOLD YOU VERY LONG.

738
01:11:20,299 --> 01:11:22,009
I SEE SOMETHING.

739
01:11:22,009 --> 01:11:24,136
DROP ME LOWER.
LOWER!

740
01:11:27,848 --> 01:11:30,476
I CAN'T REACH IT.

741
01:11:30,476 --> 01:11:32,269
MORE! LOWER!
I'M TRYING.

742
01:11:35,064 --> 01:11:37,525
HURRY!

743
01:11:57,419 --> 01:12:00,673
MY BOOK!

744
01:12:00,673 --> 01:12:02,633
BURN, YOU MOTHERFUCKER!

745
01:12:10,224 --> 01:12:11,475
DILLON!

746
01:12:36,125 --> 01:12:37,460

747
01:12:38,711 --> 01:12:39,837
MY BONES!

748
01:13:42,358 --> 01:13:43,484
CLAIRE!

749
01:13:43,484 --> 01:13:46,362
DILLON! DILLON!

750
01:13:47,696 --> 01:13:49,323
CLAIRE!

751
01:13:54,620 --> 01:13:57,331
CLAIRE!

752
01:13:57,331 --> 01:13:59,041
WHERE ARE YOU?

753
01:13:59,041 --> 01:14:01,085
MEET ME AT THE HANDCUFFS.

754
01:14:01,085 --> 01:14:02,253
THE HANDCUFFS!

755
01:14:23,733 --> 01:14:25,693
CLAIRE! DROP!

756
01:16:15,803 --> 01:16:17,263
COME ON.

757
01:16:29,692 --> 01:16:31,444
COME ON!

758
01:16:31,444 --> 01:16:33,154
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

759
01:16:36,574 --> 01:16:37,783
WAIT.

760
01:16:39,035 --> 01:16:40,494
WAIT.

761
01:16:40,494 --> 01:16:42,747
CLAIRE! CLAIRE, COME ON!

762
01:16:45,458 --> 01:16:46,584
LET'S GO!

763
01:16:51,088 --> 01:16:53,424
HOW ABOUT SOME FIRE, SCARECROW?

764
01:17:09,315 --> 01:17:10,024
NO!

765
01:17:33,256 --> 01:17:34,882
OH, MY GOD.

766
01:17:43,015 --> 01:17:45,017
YOU OK?
ARE YOU OK?

767
01:19:18,361 --> 01:19:19,403
NO!

768
01:20:19,005 --> 01:20:20,089
ARE YOU OK?

769
01:20:20,089 --> 01:20:21,090
CLAIRE?

770
01:20:37,106 --> 01:20:38,858
GOT HIM.
