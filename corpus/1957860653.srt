00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:25,577
[upbeat music]

3
00:01:22,737 --> 00:01:25,291
Tragedy struck the small
town of Los Almos, California

4
00:01:25,292 --> 00:01:29,536
last night when 16 teenagers
were found brutally murdered

5
00:01:29,537 --> 00:01:32,608
on the night of their
high school graduation.

6
00:01:32,609 --> 00:01:35,163
[ominous music]

7
00:01:35,164 --> 00:01:38,925
A local extremist by
the name of Norman Esner

8
00:01:38,926 --> 00:01:42,549
who lives less than two
miles from the crime scene

9
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:46,657
has taken a young girl hostage
at his cabin this evening.

10
00:01:46,658 --> 00:01:48,831
Police have set up a blockade,

11
00:01:48,832 --> 00:01:52,732
but so far they've been
unable to free the hostage.

12
00:01:52,733 --> 00:01:53,527
Thanks, Marta.

13
00:01:54,631 --> 00:01:56,115
I'm here at the Esner property

14
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:57,737
where authorities are
engaged in a tense stand off

15
00:01:57,738 --> 00:01:59,704
with ex-patriot, Norman Esner.

16
00:01:59,705 --> 00:02:02,086
Police have erected an
entire siege operation

17
00:02:02,087 --> 00:02:05,538
around the cabin in hopes of
forcing Esner to negotiate

18
00:02:05,539 --> 00:02:07,850
but so far talks
have not progressed.

19
00:02:07,851 --> 00:02:12,027
Locals are encouraged to stay
at home and lock their doors.

20
00:02:12,028 --> 00:02:14,754
A strict five o'clock
curfew for everyone

21
00:02:14,755 --> 00:02:19,552
under the age of 18 remains
in place until further notice.

22
00:02:19,553 --> 00:02:22,071
Here's more from the officers
in charge of this operation,

23
00:02:22,072 --> 00:02:24,315
Officer Beckett
and Officer Nuno.

24
00:02:24,316 --> 00:02:27,111
Officers, what's the latest
update in negotiations

25
00:02:27,112 --> 00:02:28,595
with Esner?

26
00:02:28,596 --> 00:02:31,840
It's been three days, he
can't stay in there forever.

27
00:02:31,841 --> 00:02:35,084
He's probably stocked
food to last through winter.

28
00:02:35,085 --> 00:02:36,327
What's the plan.

29
00:02:36,328 --> 00:02:37,501
[crowd screaming]
[gunshots firing]

30
00:02:37,502 --> 00:02:39,192
Get down!
[crowd hollering]

31
00:02:39,193 --> 00:02:42,058
[gunshots firing]

32
00:02:43,853 --> 00:02:45,613
He left in the shed, follow me!

33
00:02:46,925 --> 00:02:48,271
Come on, come on!

34
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:52,999
We have you surrounded, Norman,

35
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,829
release the girl and we
can talk this through!

36
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:58,385
I didn't hurt
anybody, I saved them!

37
00:03:01,457 --> 00:03:02,423
I freed them?

38
00:03:03,735 --> 00:03:05,356
You didn't set them
free, you murdered them!

39
00:03:05,357 --> 00:03:09,705
Half a child's innocent
stops the day they come of age.

40
00:03:09,706 --> 00:03:14,296
And when you people take that
child out of a natural habitat

41
00:03:14,297 --> 00:03:17,231
that nurtured and cared for
it, you kill the other half!

42
00:03:21,718 --> 00:03:24,618
You wonder why your children
are angry and confused,

43
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:28,586
'cause you forced them
to cross the bridge

44
00:03:28,587 --> 00:03:30,451
from innocence to sin!

45
00:03:32,971 --> 00:03:34,904
And for what, for what!

46
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:38,873
For this, for a lie!

47
00:03:42,739 --> 00:03:44,120
For a nation built on lies!

48
00:03:47,192 --> 00:03:48,951
It doesn't happen to
be this way, Norman,

49
00:03:48,952 --> 00:03:50,333
no one else has to get hurt!

50
00:03:51,783 --> 00:03:55,786
I saved them from that
and I saved them from you.

51
00:03:55,787 --> 00:03:56,753
Drop your weapon!

52
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,172
I saved them from
that, I saved them!

53
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,694
You should thank me, sheriff!

54
00:04:07,695 --> 00:04:10,352
You all should thank me!

55
00:04:10,353 --> 00:04:11,872
I am their savior!

56
00:04:15,565 --> 00:04:17,084
I will rise again.

57
00:04:29,648 --> 00:04:32,410

Satan, I belong to you.

[door banging]

70
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,748
Unlatch the door,
unlatch the door.

71
00:06:10,749 --> 00:06:14,822
I fear neither death nor
life, dark master hear me now.

72
00:06:16,237 --> 00:06:20,379
I pledge my soul to you until
the day I am called forth

73
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,035
to rise again.

74
00:06:22,036 --> 00:06:25,142
[eerie music]

[Norman breathing heavy]

76
00:06:27,663 --> 00:06:28,835
Drop the gun!

77
00:06:28,836 --> 00:06:31,528
- Rest assured.
- Drop the gun!

00:07:09,359 --> 00:07:11,153
My god, could you have
picked a closer diner,

82
00:07:11,154 --> 00:07:12,500
I'm starving.

83
00:07:12,501 --> 00:07:13,984
It has great reviews.

84
00:07:13,985 --> 00:07:16,814
Something tells me it
doesn't have rigatoni.

85
00:07:16,815 --> 00:07:21,820
It's June 13th,
2016 and here we are

86
00:07:22,545 --> 00:07:23,235
at the Park Bench Grill.

87
00:07:23,235 --> 00:07:24,029

[people laughing]

89
00:07:26,411 --> 00:07:29,828
For our last supper before we
reach our final destination,

90
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,933
the Esner cabin.

91
00:07:31,934 --> 00:07:34,142
Maybe you can
interview the locals.

92
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:36,316
Ooh, yeah, maybe.

93
00:07:36,317 --> 00:07:37,628

95
00:07:44,394 --> 00:07:45,636
All right, Debbie!

96
00:07:45,637 --> 00:07:49,364
Hey, Linda, I'll see
you in the morning.

97
00:07:49,365 --> 00:07:51,262
Hurray, you're a surprise
or something huh?

98
00:07:51,263 --> 00:07:54,265
- I got a surprise for you.
- Mm, okay.

99
00:07:54,266 --> 00:07:58,028
Something tells me they're
not gonna be up for questions.

100
00:07:58,029 --> 00:07:59,512
Yeah.

101
00:07:59,513 --> 00:08:01,619
I guess it's self seating.

102
00:08:03,068 --> 00:08:06,071
[people chattering]

103
00:08:23,606 --> 00:08:25,711
Is it just me or is some
of these people giving

104
00:08:25,712 --> 00:08:27,298
me the heebie-jeebies?

105
00:08:27,299 --> 00:08:30,509
[people laughing]

106
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:33,304
Now's your chance, Katie
Couric, go interview them.

107
00:08:33,305 --> 00:08:35,168
Okay this is just a hobby.

108
00:08:35,169 --> 00:08:36,963
You know very well I'm going
to performing arts school

109
00:08:36,964 --> 00:08:38,171
in the fall.

110
00:08:38,172 --> 00:08:39,104
Yeah, she's an amazing
artist and vocalist.

111
00:08:39,105 --> 00:08:43,937
Here check this out, hmm?

112
00:08:45,076 --> 00:08:47,180
She designed it
herself, kitty cat.

113
00:08:47,181 --> 00:08:48,941
Multi-talented and beautiful.

114
00:08:48,942 --> 00:08:52,427
Aww, always say
what they wanna hear.

115
00:08:52,428 --> 00:08:53,980
Spoken like a future politician.

116
00:08:53,981 --> 00:08:55,188
[people laughing]

117
00:08:55,189 --> 00:08:58,778
I only say what I
mean unlike some people.

118
00:08:58,779 --> 00:09:00,228
We'll see if you're
singing that same tune

119
00:09:00,229 --> 00:09:01,540
after you're two
years in office.

120
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,024
[people laughing]

121
00:09:03,025 --> 00:09:05,129
I wanna make positive changes,

122
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:06,855
I'm not in for the glory.

123
00:09:06,856 --> 00:09:07,960
Sure.

124
00:09:07,961 --> 00:09:08,961
[people laughing]

125
00:09:08,962 --> 00:09:11,032
Oh.

126
00:09:11,033 --> 00:09:14,000
Hey, my friend, Rita will
be here in a few minutes.

127
00:09:14,001 --> 00:09:16,106
I invited her to ride
with us, she lives close.

128
00:09:16,107 --> 00:09:17,452
You guys don't mind, do you?

129
00:09:17,453 --> 00:09:18,281
- Oh no.
- No.

130
00:09:18,281 --> 00:09:19,110
- No.
- No.

131
00:09:21,906 --> 00:09:23,666
Oh, no, I guess not.

132
00:09:27,187 --> 00:09:31,017
So, this cabin belong
to a famous murderer.

133
00:09:31,018 --> 00:09:32,848
Norman Esner.

134
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:36,298
[ominous music]

135
00:09:36,299 --> 00:09:38,715
He went crazy there
almost 20 years ago,

136
00:09:38,716 --> 00:09:41,994
murdered the entire high
school graduating class.

137
00:09:41,995 --> 00:09:44,411
[Anna gasps]

138
00:09:47,276 --> 00:09:48,795
Easy, she's blind.

139
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:52,280
We thought it would be fun
to practice our witchcraft

140
00:09:52,281 --> 00:09:53,868
with a seance there.

141
00:09:53,869 --> 00:09:56,111
And we're getting in there how?

142
00:09:56,112 --> 00:09:58,424
I only found out about
the place a few weeks ago

143
00:09:58,425 --> 00:10:01,082
after my mom put it up for sale.

144
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:03,636
I looked up the address and
discovered it's cool history.

145
00:10:03,637 --> 00:10:05,673
Your mom never
mentioned it before?

146
00:10:05,674 --> 00:10:07,640
No, I didn't even know
she owned the property

147
00:10:07,641 --> 00:10:11,057
but that didn't stop me
from stealing the keys.

148
00:10:11,058 --> 00:10:13,197
It's the perfect place
for one last party

149
00:10:13,198 --> 00:10:15,165
before we all go
our separate ways.

150
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:19,756
Yeah.
[hands clapping]

151
00:10:19,757 --> 00:10:23,036
Hey, it's just college, it'll
be over before you know it.

152
00:10:24,244 --> 00:10:27,798
Then it'll be on to our
next adventure together.

153
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:29,076
Friends forever, right?

154
00:10:30,077 --> 00:10:31,630
About time.

155
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,942
All right, well, I'm gonna take
this grilled chicken breast

156
00:10:33,943 --> 00:10:36,048
and maybe a couple of those
breasts if you don't mind.

157
00:10:36,049 --> 00:10:36,946
Come here baby.

158
00:10:39,535 --> 00:10:41,363
Hey, Tex, the lady
doesn't wanna be touched!

159
00:10:41,364 --> 00:10:42,433
Come on.

160
00:10:42,434 --> 00:10:43,676
[body slammed]

161
00:10:43,677 --> 00:10:47,749
Whoa, whoa mind your
own business city boy.

162
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,302
Well, you just
made it my business.

163
00:10:49,303 --> 00:10:50,787
All right, geeze, man,
we was just joking around.

164
00:10:50,788 --> 00:10:55,068
No, you touch her again
and you have to deal with me.

165
00:10:56,621 --> 00:10:58,553
Oh my god.
[Dean laughing]

166
00:10:58,554 --> 00:10:59,796
Do you believe this guy?

167
00:10:59,797 --> 00:11:01,177
All right, pretty
boy, I'm sorry.

168
00:11:04,629 --> 00:11:05,906
Why don't you go
back to your table.

169
00:11:07,114 --> 00:11:09,116
It's time for you to
leave, you big bully.

170
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:13,568
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
we was leaving anyway.

171
00:11:13,569 --> 00:11:15,053
Hey girls, call me.

172
00:11:16,641 --> 00:11:17,779
Come on.

173
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:19,195
[Jeff] We was leaving
anyways, let's go.

174
00:11:20,403 --> 00:11:21,439
[Dan] Let's get the
hell out of here guys.

175
00:11:27,756 --> 00:11:29,618
[Jeff] He really
put you in your place.

[upbeat country music]

177
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:33,520
Oh he's in danger now.

178

[Jeff laughing]

179
00:11:38,387 --> 00:11:41,285
Hey, that's their car, right?

He obviously used
his the wrong way.

360
00:23:57,746 --> 00:23:59,229
- Kiss me, maiden.
- Get away!

361
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:00,438
[Greg laughing]

362
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:01,887
[Greg] I think King
Tut forgot his mask.

363
00:24:01,888 --> 00:24:03,855
Put that back, Greg,
it could be valuable,

364
00:24:03,856 --> 00:24:05,098
I'm talking to you idiots.

365
00:24:07,549 --> 00:24:09,343
I think he looks
younger in this one.

366
00:24:09,344 --> 00:24:11,103
Hey, I can't believe
you talked me into coming

367
00:24:11,104 --> 00:24:13,934
to a place that once belonged
to a serial killer, Ashley.

368
00:24:13,935 --> 00:24:15,591
Okay, I don't do
this sort of thing.

369
00:24:15,592 --> 00:24:18,352
Actually, he wasn't
a serial killer.

370
00:24:18,353 --> 00:24:21,251
A serial killer's a person who
attacks and kills his victims

371
00:24:21,252 --> 00:24:22,977
in a series of incidents.

372
00:24:22,978 --> 00:24:25,635
Esner killed all his in one day.

373
00:24:25,636 --> 00:24:27,499
Well, he must have
been a really bad dude.

374
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:30,572
Well, he didn't
start out that way.

375
00:24:31,746 --> 00:24:34,713
He joined the military
right after high school

376
00:24:34,714 --> 00:24:38,199
and quickly worked his way
up the ranks to sniper.

377
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,304
[dramatic music]

378
00:24:39,305 --> 00:24:40,788
He made this town proud.

379
00:24:40,789 --> 00:24:43,722
Even rescued a dozen of his
comrades who were held hostage

380
00:24:43,723 --> 00:24:46,000
all by himself.

381
00:24:46,001 --> 00:24:48,969
Brought back a necklace of
ears after that mission.

382
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:50,211
Necklace of ears.

383
00:24:50,212 --> 00:24:54,630
He cut of an ear from
each enemy he killed.

384
00:24:54,631 --> 00:24:57,011
I read it was at least 50 guys.

385
00:24:57,012 --> 00:24:59,773
Him and his comrades were
tossing the necklace around

386
00:24:59,774 --> 00:25:02,741
like some sort of
trophy all the way home.

387
00:25:02,742 --> 00:25:03,605
Creepy huh?

388
00:25:05,745 --> 00:25:08,576
Grow up, you're so immature.

389
00:25:10,474 --> 00:25:14,582
But the war, all the
killing were too much for him.

390
00:25:15,721 --> 00:25:18,377
He started to become
angry with the military

391
00:25:18,378 --> 00:25:19,518
and his country.

392
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:23,175
He was discharged
and returned home.

393
00:25:23,176 --> 00:25:26,662
After attempting to live
in town among civilians,

394
00:25:26,663 --> 00:25:30,873
his odd behavior became
more and more noticeable.

395
00:25:30,874 --> 00:25:33,496
Like preaching
anti-military propaganda,

396
00:25:33,497 --> 00:25:36,535
said the military
stole his soul.

397
00:25:37,708 --> 00:25:39,433
When it became apparent
that Esner wasn't going

398
00:25:39,434 --> 00:25:43,161
to settle back into town,
he moved to this cabin

399
00:25:43,162 --> 00:25:46,683
deep in the woods and
isolated himself here.

400
00:25:47,891 --> 00:25:51,825
Then several veterans
officers around the US

401
00:25:51,826 --> 00:25:55,449
reported receiving
envelopes with white powder

402
00:25:55,450 --> 00:25:57,107
and anti-government rants.

403
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:01,731
They suspected it was him
but the lead investigator

404
00:26:01,732 --> 00:26:03,044
had a soft spot for Esner.

405
00:26:04,217 --> 00:26:07,566
His own son was one
of the men he rescued.

406
00:26:08,843 --> 00:26:11,154
When one of the veteran's
offices reported

407
00:26:11,155 --> 00:26:13,847
receiving a human
ear in the mail,

408
00:26:13,848 --> 00:26:17,022
the investigator
knew it was Esner

409
00:26:17,023 --> 00:26:22,028
but he made the case
and the ear disappear.

410
00:26:23,202 --> 00:26:26,100
And you found all
this out online, hmm?

411
00:26:26,101 --> 00:26:26,895
[Meghan] Yes.

412
00:26:28,138 --> 00:26:29,621
What do you say we
change the subject

413
00:26:29,622 --> 00:26:32,693
and pick out our rooms, spruce
this place up a little bit?

414
00:26:32,694 --> 00:26:33,901
- That sounds good to me.
- Maybe they can find

415
00:26:33,902 --> 00:26:36,594
a few brooms and
sweep these floors.

416
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:38,043
Yep, yes.

417
00:26:38,044 --> 00:26:41,219
Oh, Rita, Ashley and
James look around in here,

418
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:43,566
I saw some tools out back,
I'm gonna show Ashley

419
00:26:43,567 --> 00:26:44,430
where they're at.

420
00:26:46,915 --> 00:26:48,329
Rick, help me unload the car?

421
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:50,435
Oh Anna, honey can I
borrow your hairspray?

422
00:26:50,436 --> 00:26:52,611
I think I left
mine in James' car.

423
00:26:53,922 --> 00:26:55,440
Of course, sweetie,
it's in my bag.

424
00:26:55,441 --> 00:26:56,579
Why don't you go buy a
tampon while you're at it.

425
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:58,581
Very funny James.

426
00:26:58,582 --> 00:27:00,895
I would dear, but my
period ended last week.

427
00:27:02,103 --> 00:27:02,931
Come on.

428
00:27:06,797 --> 00:27:08,695
You could ease
up on him you know?

429
00:27:08,696 --> 00:27:09,558
I just feel like
every time I turn around

430
00:27:09,558 --> 00:27:10,421
he's next to you.

431
00:27:11,733 --> 00:27:13,769
You can't blame me for
wanting to have my girlfriend

432
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:15,047
all to myself, can you?

433
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,641
Next he's gonna be asking
to borrow your underwear.

434
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:27,437
Actually, I told him he
could borrow some of Austin's.

435
00:27:27,438 --> 00:27:29,647
You don't think
he'll mind do you?

436
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:31,649
He left all his
stuff in your car.

437
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,616
Okay, okay, too much info.

438
00:27:33,617 --> 00:27:36,689
All right, help me
clean up this dump.

439
00:27:38,173 --> 00:27:40,761
Yeah, clean up your face,
I got lipstick all over you.

440
00:27:40,762 --> 00:27:43,523
[door squeaking]

441
00:27:44,973 --> 00:27:46,664
- Oh my god.
- Whoa!

442
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:49,287
[teens laughing]

443
00:27:49,288 --> 00:27:50,841
Right, move this.

444
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:59,262
[teens laughing]

445
00:27:59,263 --> 00:28:00,644
- Perfect.
- Hey.

446
00:28:08,410 --> 00:28:09,239
[coughing]

447
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:12,034
[teens laughing]

448
00:28:12,035 --> 00:28:12,863
Perfect.

449
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:16,763
That's pretty comfy.

450
00:28:16,764 --> 00:28:19,628
[Ashley laughing]

451
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:27,187
We can't do it right now.

452
00:28:27,188 --> 00:28:29,638
Sure we can, you promised.

453
00:28:43,031 --> 00:28:44,861
You still have that?

454
00:28:45,965 --> 00:28:48,105
The offer still
stands if you'll accept.

455
00:28:54,353 --> 00:28:58,460
Of course I'll
marry you eventually.

456
00:29:05,364 --> 00:29:06,365
You bitch.

457
00:29:08,091 --> 00:29:09,748
You know I need to
reach the world, you know,

458
00:29:11,025 --> 00:29:12,473
make some new friends.

459
00:29:12,474 --> 00:29:14,786
And luckily I've
already met Rita.

460
00:29:14,787 --> 00:29:16,754
Yeah, how does
Meghan feel about hat?

461
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:19,274
She can be awfully clingy.

462
00:29:21,311 --> 00:29:22,760
Meghan will be fine.

463
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:26,523
She knows I'm leaving,
I know Meghan.

464
00:29:27,731 --> 00:29:29,352
What the fuck, Ashley?

465
00:29:29,353 --> 00:29:32,010
She's always been such
a really good friend and

466
00:29:32,011 --> 00:29:37,016
[Meghan seething]
[indistinct].

467
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:55,655
[Meghan screaming]
[dramatic music]

468
00:30:14,364 --> 00:30:16,952
Look what I found, huh?

469
00:30:16,953 --> 00:30:17,987
I thought all that
was lost in James' car,

470
00:30:17,988 --> 00:30:19,609
thank Jesus.

471
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:21,819
I must have put it
in Ashley's by mistake.

472
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,303
I'll drink to that.

473
00:30:23,304 --> 00:30:26,928
- You'll drink to anything.
- So, what's your point?

474
00:30:28,447 --> 00:30:29,275
Uh, Meghan, you're bleeding.

475
00:30:29,276 --> 00:30:31,173
What happened?

476
00:30:31,174 --> 00:30:34,659
I cut myself on a glass
vase, it's no big deal.

477
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:37,075
You might wanna put
some medicine on there.

478
00:30:37,076 --> 00:30:39,423
I said I'm fine,
really I'm good.

479
00:30:41,805 --> 00:30:45,325
This weekend isn't just
a fun filled time for us,

480
00:30:45,326 --> 00:30:46,879
it's also a test.

481
00:30:47,811 --> 00:30:49,329
Of our skills.

482
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:51,918
As most of you know we've
been studying witchcraft

483
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:53,402
the past few years.

484
00:30:53,403 --> 00:30:57,061
Today we offer you the
opportunity to join our coven,

485
00:30:57,062 --> 00:31:01,100
to watch, learn and
do as instructed.

486
00:31:02,032 --> 00:31:03,585
Do you accept this opportunity?

487
00:31:05,415 --> 00:31:07,519
Sure, whatever.

488
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,659
What makes you think
this stuff is real?

489
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:11,523
I can name dozens of instances.

490
00:31:11,524 --> 00:31:14,181
When Ashley was failing
math, she did a spell

491
00:31:14,182 --> 00:31:16,735
and she pulled her
grade from an F to a C

492
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:18,082
in just three weeks.

493
00:31:18,083 --> 00:31:19,600
Hmm-mm.

494
00:31:19,601 --> 00:31:20,705
You'd be amazed at what a
few weeks of hardcore studying

495
00:31:20,706 --> 00:31:22,880
can do.
[people laughing]

496
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:24,502
I cast a spell on my last
boyfriend that cheated on me,

497
00:31:24,503 --> 00:31:28,713
he broke into hives
in a delicate area.

498
00:31:28,714 --> 00:31:29,956
[Greg laughing]

499
00:31:29,957 --> 00:31:31,543
I put a hex on that
bully, Sarah Winters

500
00:31:31,544 --> 00:31:33,683
who was harassing me at school

501
00:31:33,684 --> 00:31:36,445
and the next day she
mysteriously dropped out.

502
00:31:36,446 --> 00:31:39,897
She dropped out
because she was pregnant.

503
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:42,244
I cast a spell for Austin
to become the quarterback

504
00:31:42,245 --> 00:31:44,454
of the football
team, which he did.

505
00:31:46,352 --> 00:31:48,112
Well, thank you baby.

506
00:31:48,113 --> 00:31:51,391
Oh, those all could
be coincidences.

507
00:31:51,392 --> 00:31:52,703
We also talk to the dead.

508
00:31:53,877 --> 00:31:55,844
I talk to my mom all
the time through Meghan.

509
00:32:01,333 --> 00:32:04,404
So how do we do this?

510
00:32:04,405 --> 00:32:05,440
Oh, no not in here.

511
00:32:06,855 --> 00:32:08,684
We're going down
to the basement.

512
00:32:08,685 --> 00:32:10,928
- Oh the basement.
- Oh.

513
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:12,170
[teens laughing]

514
00:32:12,171 --> 00:32:13,620
[ominous music]

515
00:32:13,621 --> 00:32:15,104
- I wish it wasn't dark.
- It has to be dark

516
00:32:15,105 --> 00:32:18,522
in here if you wanna join,
witches don't fear the dark.

517
00:32:19,523 --> 00:32:21,662
Repeat after me.

518
00:32:21,663 --> 00:32:23,320
I bind myself to this coven.

519
00:32:24,356 --> 00:32:26,598
[disembodied entity laughing]

520
00:32:26,599 --> 00:32:28,291
This isn't a joke,
say your liege.

521
00:32:30,569 --> 00:32:32,847
[All] I bind
myself to this coven.

522
00:32:36,126 --> 00:32:37,195
[Meghan] Do you
promise to protect

523
00:32:37,196 --> 00:32:38,853
the members of this coven?

524
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:41,373
Hey you got anymore of
that liquor back there?

525
00:32:41,374 --> 00:32:42,719
No, that was it.

526
00:32:43,858 --> 00:32:46,549
And it's keep
it's secrets close.

527
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:47,688
- What's this?
- What you got there

528
00:32:47,689 --> 00:32:48,518
baby girl?

529
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:52,348
[Meghan] Give me your hands,
I have to put a small cut

530
00:32:52,349 --> 00:32:53,936
into each of you.

531
00:32:53,937 --> 00:32:55,179
- You wanna play doctor?
- You know I wanna

532
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:55,974
play doctor.

533
00:32:57,596 --> 00:33:00,287
Hey now, come on,
come on, cut it out.

534
00:33:00,288 --> 00:33:03,946
Hey, come on, stop
it, man, I can't see!

535
00:33:03,947 --> 00:33:05,154
[eerie music]

536
00:33:05,155 --> 00:33:06,259
[Meghan] Now we'll all
put our hands together

537
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:07,881
and become one.

538
00:33:07,882 --> 00:33:11,541
Hey I can't see, I
can't see, god damn it!

539
00:33:13,508 --> 00:33:14,750
God damn it Mandy!

540
00:33:14,751 --> 00:33:16,752
[Meghan] Are there
any spirits here that

541
00:33:16,753 --> 00:33:18,306
want to talk to us [indistinct]?

542
00:33:19,514 --> 00:33:20,928
[Dan coughing]

543
00:33:20,929 --> 00:33:24,656
Come on, I can't
see a god damn thing.

544
00:33:24,657 --> 00:33:27,143
[eerie music]

545
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:30,732
[ominous music]

546
00:33:33,804 --> 00:33:37,981
[Meghan] Of magic [indistinct].

547
00:33:39,431 --> 00:33:41,950
- Oh shit.
- I will rise again.

548
00:33:44,263 --> 00:33:46,852
[car crashing]

549
00:34:01,867 --> 00:34:03,282
That wasn't there before.

550
00:34:04,525 --> 00:34:06,008
It was here when I came up.

551
00:34:06,009 --> 00:34:07,424
It's like super old school.

552
00:34:08,874 --> 00:34:12,257
- You mean it still works?
- Only one way to find out.

553
00:34:19,195 --> 00:34:21,887
[ominous music]

554
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:41,079
[victims screaming]

555
00:34:58,406 --> 00:34:59,510
[Rita gasps]

556
00:34:59,511 --> 00:35:01,167
[James gasping]

557
00:35:01,168 --> 00:35:04,687
[blade stabbing]

558
00:35:04,688 --> 00:35:07,346
[tape ejecting]

559
00:35:12,006 --> 00:35:13,870
It could have been
filmed anywhere.

560
00:35:15,043 --> 00:35:17,700
Really, isn't that
the shed out back?

561
00:35:17,701 --> 00:35:19,737
I didn't see a shed out back.

562
00:35:19,738 --> 00:35:20,566
It's out there.

563
00:35:22,189 --> 00:35:24,122
I saw it when Meghan
and I went for a walk.

564
00:35:26,331 --> 00:35:28,125
So he filmed himself
during the slaughter,

565
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:30,161
do you think the
police know about this?

566
00:35:30,162 --> 00:35:32,819
I didn't find anything
online about a video tape.

567
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:34,407
Did you see the way.

568
00:35:34,408 --> 00:35:37,100
[Rita vomiting]

569
00:35:46,282 --> 00:35:48,145
Should we take the
tape to the police,

570
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:49,664
just brush it off as a hoax?

571
00:35:50,562 --> 00:35:52,287
That was no hoax.

572
00:35:52,288 --> 00:35:54,185
You heard how adamant
that cop was about us

573
00:35:54,186 --> 00:35:55,911
not coming here.

574
00:35:55,912 --> 00:35:56,981
He probably has
nothing better to do

575
00:35:56,982 --> 00:35:58,534
than to fuck with tourists.

576
00:35:58,535 --> 00:36:00,536
Unless someone at
the diner overheard us.

577
00:36:00,537 --> 00:36:05,058
Real or not, now
whoever left this tape

578
00:36:05,059 --> 00:36:07,164
is probably sitting
somewhere right now

579
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:08,235
having a good laugh.

580
00:36:09,822 --> 00:36:12,756
Rita was the only one in the
room when the tape appeared.

581
00:36:14,793 --> 00:36:16,449
Ashley how well do
you really know her?

582
00:36:16,450 --> 00:36:18,071
Yeah, you really think that I.

583
00:36:18,072 --> 00:36:19,728
Meghan that's ridiculous.

584
00:36:19,729 --> 00:36:21,557
I was only pointing out a fact.

585
00:36:21,558 --> 00:36:23,387
I didn't mean to accuse anyone.

586
00:36:23,388 --> 00:36:26,459
You wanna know what
I think, I think Esner

587
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:28,185
left that tape for us.

588
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:29,531
Okay, you heard what he
said when we were down

589
00:36:29,532 --> 00:36:31,049
in that basement.

590
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:34,950
I say we pack up our shit
and go before it's too late.

591
00:36:34,951 --> 00:36:37,919
Now, Esner went in the shed.

592
00:36:38,782 --> 00:36:40,163
We should just check it out.

593
00:36:41,095 --> 00:36:44,028
Austin, are you crazy?

594
00:36:44,029 --> 00:36:46,064
Check the shed, you know
what, give me your keys,

595
00:36:46,065 --> 00:36:47,549
give me your keys, I'm leaving.

596
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:50,345
And anyone else who wants
to come too is welcome.

597
00:36:50,346 --> 00:36:53,313
Look, whoever left the
tape wanted to hurt us,

598
00:36:53,314 --> 00:36:55,765
they would have done it
when they had the chance.

599
00:36:57,318 --> 00:37:01,771
Here, take this if it'll
make you feel any better.

600
00:37:08,743 --> 00:37:09,572
Come on.

601
00:37:15,336 --> 00:37:16,855
[James] Come on.

602
00:37:18,477 --> 00:37:19,651
[Anna] Okay.

603
00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:39,049
[door creaks]

604
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:04,522
[Greg coughing]

605
00:38:04,523 --> 00:38:06,317
Probably tastes like
shit after 20 years.

606
00:38:06,318 --> 00:38:08,700
- Yeah, you'd know Greg.
- Oh good one.

607
00:38:25,751 --> 00:38:28,615
Oh my god, is that
what I think it is?

608
00:38:28,616 --> 00:38:32,239
Well, I guess the story
about the necklace of ears

609
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,482
was true.

610
00:38:33,483 --> 00:38:35,036
Let's hope we don't
find the rest of them.

611
00:38:40,421 --> 00:38:42,906
These letters are dated
over 20 years ago.

612
00:38:57,231 --> 00:38:59,060
I got you a present.

613
00:39:14,490 --> 00:39:18,286
Face of angel, pure innocence.

614
00:39:24,638 --> 00:39:26,915
You know I wasn't supposed
to keep you around this long,

615
00:39:26,916 --> 00:39:28,055
don't you?

616
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:37,132
You're such a good girl for not
fighting me like the others.

617
00:39:37,133 --> 00:39:39,928
[eerie music]

618
00:39:39,929 --> 00:39:42,863
Can you offer me forgiveness
for not saving you?

619
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:55,496
I need you to forgive me.

620
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:07,232
[ominous music]

621
00:40:20,901 --> 00:40:23,006
I need you to forgive me.

622
00:40:23,869 --> 00:40:25,423
Everybody got what they need?

623
00:40:26,562 --> 00:40:27,839
Let's take a look at
them in the cabin.

624
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:30,428
Let's go.

625
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:45,165
I need you to forgive me.

626
00:40:45,166 --> 00:40:48,617
[victims screaming]

627
00:40:48,618 --> 00:40:49,585
[car crashing]

628
00:40:49,586 --> 00:40:51,102
[passengers screaming]

629
00:40:51,103 --> 00:40:53,140
Fuck fuck motherfucker!

630
00:40:55,176 --> 00:40:56,005
God damn it!

631
00:40:56,006 --> 00:40:58,973
[passengers crying]

632
00:41:00,596 --> 00:41:02,598
- Are you okay?
- God no.

633
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:09,052
Come on, come on.
- Man!

634
00:41:11,192 --> 00:41:12,779
- Ow my hair.
- How many times

635
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:14,712
do I gotta tell you to not mess

636
00:41:14,713 --> 00:41:17,026
with me when I'm driving, huh?

637
00:41:20,443 --> 00:41:23,376
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

638
00:41:23,377 --> 00:41:24,619
Go get!
[Mandy cries]

639
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:26,552
Hey, maybe we can fix it.

640
00:41:26,553 --> 00:41:29,520
Maybe we can fix it, now
you sound as dumb as she does.

641
00:41:29,521 --> 00:41:31,108
Man look at this
thing it's totaled.

642
00:41:31,109 --> 00:41:32,627
- Hey.
- I'm on probation

643
00:41:32,628 --> 00:41:35,492
and if anybody finds out about
this, I'm going to jail, so.

644
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:37,839
Hey, look nobody saw us,
let's just ditch it right here

645
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:39,081
and go.
- Where,

646
00:41:39,082 --> 00:41:40,911
ditch it and then go where, man?

647
00:41:40,912 --> 00:41:42,188
We're in the middle
of fucking nowhere.

648
00:41:42,189 --> 00:41:43,879
- Look man, I don't know.
- Idiots.

649
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,847
We gotta walk somewhere.

650
00:41:45,848 --> 00:41:50,818
Hey, hey, what about here?

651
00:41:59,206 --> 00:42:00,172
Huh, maybe you do got
some brain cells left

652
00:42:00,172 --> 00:42:01,104
in that dumb head of yours.

653
00:42:03,003 --> 00:42:04,349
Let's go, come on, come on!

654
00:42:07,421 --> 00:42:10,458
- Dude, where the hell are we?
- Hey girls, we ain't

655
00:42:11,805 --> 00:42:13,116
got all day, let's go!

656
00:42:33,102 --> 00:42:34,137
It's just letters.

657
00:42:35,242 --> 00:42:37,900
[ominous music]

658
00:42:38,866 --> 00:42:40,211
Oh, ooh.

659
00:42:40,212 --> 00:42:42,111
What is that?

660
00:42:46,149 --> 00:42:46,978
Uh.

661
00:42:48,669 --> 00:42:49,532
- A dead lizard.
- Sick.

662
00:42:54,261 --> 00:42:56,884
[ominous music]

663
00:43:07,343 --> 00:43:08,689
It's written in all caps.

664
00:43:13,211 --> 00:43:16,869
"Dear reporter, I'm writing
this letter to condemn

665
00:43:16,870 --> 00:43:19,319
our government and
military for the actions

666
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:21,425
they have taken
against humanity.

667
00:43:21,426 --> 00:43:24,911
It took death and destruction
to bring me to the realization

668
00:43:24,912 --> 00:43:28,535
that I too was once a
lamb plucked from my home

669
00:43:28,536 --> 00:43:31,228
and sent to unfamiliar pastures.

670
00:43:31,229 --> 00:43:33,333
Taken from the safe
haven of my youth

671
00:43:33,334 --> 00:43:36,613
to only be altered forever.

672
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:40,410
But like the lamb the wool
was pulled deep over my eyes.

673
00:43:44,104 --> 00:43:46,312
These children are
being brainwashed

674
00:43:46,313 --> 00:43:48,866
and manipulated under
false pretenses by not only

675
00:43:48,867 --> 00:43:51,697
the military but also
these institutions

676
00:43:51,698 --> 00:43:53,871
and modern day colleges.

677
00:43:53,872 --> 00:43:56,736
They are uses these
children as puppets,

678
00:43:56,737 --> 00:44:00,084
removing the soul and
leaving only an empty shell

679
00:44:00,085 --> 00:44:04,192
which like the marionette they
can manipulate with strings

680
00:44:04,193 --> 00:44:05,194
to do their bidding.

681
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:09,715
We must spread the word
worldwide and put an end to them

682
00:44:09,716 --> 00:44:11,269
before it is too late.

683
00:44:12,684 --> 00:44:14,790
I feel like you are the
only one to tell my story.

684
00:44:15,929 --> 00:44:18,656
I wait your reply,
Norman Ester."

685
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:31,668
"Dear reporter, I have been
patiently waiting your reply.

686
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:35,534
My story must be told and
I am running out of time.

687
00:44:36,881 --> 00:44:39,158
I can't begin to tell
you how ashamed I am

688
00:44:39,159 --> 00:44:41,506
every time someone
calls me a war hero.

689
00:44:42,956 --> 00:44:45,440
It absolutely destroys me
to think what this country

690
00:44:45,441 --> 00:44:47,236
did to me and the other souls.

691
00:44:48,547 --> 00:44:51,722
I feel a sickness in the
deepest pit of my soul

692
00:44:51,723 --> 00:44:56,038
knowing I cannot save them
all from their ill fate.

693
00:44:57,211 --> 00:44:59,385
A blackness is growing
within me and I know

694
00:44:59,386 --> 00:45:01,456
if I do not act soon
it will spread until

695
00:45:01,457 --> 00:45:03,665
it consumes everything.

696
00:45:03,666 --> 00:45:07,048
Please let me know if you
have received this letter,

697
00:45:07,049 --> 00:45:08,326
Norman Ester."

698
00:45:14,988 --> 00:45:16,783
This one was sent
to the governor,

699
00:45:17,991 --> 00:45:19,233
it was returned unopened.

700
00:45:24,376 --> 00:45:27,379
This was also sent
to the governor.

701
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:36,285
This one to the leader
of the CIA, FBI,

702
00:45:38,356 --> 00:45:40,771
another to the president
of the United States,

703
00:45:40,772 --> 00:45:41,773
all unopened.

704
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:47,537
"Don't let them be next."

705
00:45:49,091 --> 00:45:51,126
There's something
written on the back.

706
00:45:51,127 --> 00:45:54,267
"Stop recruiters from going
to your schools, homes

707
00:45:54,268 --> 00:45:56,857
and churches and
selling them on lies.

708
00:45:58,825 --> 00:46:00,550
Save your children."

709
00:46:01,931 --> 00:46:03,243
That's beyond fucked up.

710
00:46:06,902 --> 00:46:08,557
These articles Norman match up

711
00:46:08,558 --> 00:46:10,940
to the kinds of the letters.

712
00:46:14,806 --> 00:46:19,777
This one is dated June 14,
1995, the day of the massacre.

713
00:46:23,263 --> 00:46:24,782
"I'm ready for doomsday.

714
00:46:25,955 --> 00:46:28,025
Most people will not
understand my actions

715
00:46:28,026 --> 00:46:30,926
but perhaps there will be those
enlightened ones who will.

716
00:46:32,755 --> 00:46:35,688
I know my time here is
short and I will be forced

717
00:46:35,689 --> 00:46:39,036
to take myself out of
this world in the process

718
00:46:39,037 --> 00:46:43,076
but thanks to the ritual
I am able to return."

719
00:46:47,045 --> 00:46:47,874
Last one.

720
00:46:49,323 --> 00:46:50,704
Do you wanna do the honors?

721
00:47:01,370 --> 00:47:04,166
"It has been two days since
I brought the girl here.

722
00:47:05,512 --> 00:47:08,859
I admit that I find
something about her soothing

723
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:12,450
and I know now that there are
bigger powers at play here.

724
00:47:13,313 --> 00:47:15,108
She was spared for a reason.

725
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:21,666
Linda Hamilton,
such a pretty name."

726
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:26,256
Isn't that your mom's
name, Linda Hamilton?

727
00:47:26,257 --> 00:47:29,191
Melinda Hamilton.
- No, no.

728
00:47:30,675 --> 00:47:34,436
And you said your mother
only told that your father

729
00:47:34,437 --> 00:47:36,128
died in the military.

730
00:47:36,129 --> 00:47:38,855
Yeah, my mom just doesn't
like to talk about it.

731
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:40,028
There must be a connection.

732
00:47:40,029 --> 00:47:42,099
And your mom owning this cabin,

733
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:44,412
is that just a coincidence too?

734
00:47:44,413 --> 00:47:46,552
There must be some kind
of unexplainable force

735
00:47:46,553 --> 00:47:48,002
pulling you back to this cabin.

736
00:47:48,003 --> 00:47:50,418
I told you already I
found the keys by accident.

737
00:47:50,419 --> 00:47:54,215
There are no accidents
in the spirit world.

738
00:47:54,216 --> 00:47:57,391
Why are you guys
doing this to me?

739
00:47:58,910 --> 00:48:00,394
You're supposed to my friends.

740
00:48:02,327 --> 00:48:06,710
So, Meghan's psycho's baby?

741
00:48:06,711 --> 00:48:07,539
Stop it!

742
00:48:09,748 --> 00:48:11,716
That can't be true,
it's not true.

743
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:19,171
- Oh my god.
- You okay?

744
00:48:19,172 --> 00:48:20,379
Yeah.

745
00:48:20,380 --> 00:48:21,484
Why do you always
have to be such a dick?

746
00:48:25,695 --> 00:48:28,284
[item rattles]

747
00:48:31,322 --> 00:48:32,150
Hey!

748
00:48:40,814 --> 00:48:41,988
Jesus, man.

749
00:48:43,782 --> 00:48:44,714
[Dan chuckles]

750
00:48:44,714 --> 00:48:45,543
Good, you guys are all here.

751
00:48:46,613 --> 00:48:47,441
You again.

752
00:48:47,442 --> 00:48:48,925
Surprise.

753
00:48:48,926 --> 00:48:50,547
Come back to return my car?

754
00:48:50,548 --> 00:48:53,343
Oh yeah, about that Chuck,
I got in a little accident

755
00:48:53,344 --> 00:48:55,277
on the way over here, sorry.

756
00:48:56,726 --> 00:48:58,175
What, what do you mean
you got into an accident?

757
00:48:58,176 --> 00:49:00,315
Hey, man it wasn't
our fault you know?

758
00:49:00,316 --> 00:49:02,041
Smoke started pouring from
the hood, something ran

759
00:49:02,042 --> 00:49:04,112
in front of us, a
deer or some shit.

760
00:49:04,113 --> 00:49:06,045
You reek of alcohol.

761
00:49:06,046 --> 00:49:08,945
Oh, man look,
the girls are hurt,

762
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:10,360
they need to go to the hospital.

763
00:49:10,361 --> 00:49:12,569
Go ahead, help yourself.

764
00:49:12,570 --> 00:49:14,951
She can't help it man,
she's the child of alcoholic,

765
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:15,918
right baby?

766
00:49:15,919 --> 00:49:17,539
Give me that thing.

767
00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:19,127
Hey you gonna bring us
to the hospital or not,

768
00:49:19,128 --> 00:49:20,646
give me the beer.

769
00:49:20,647 --> 00:49:21,923
Yeah, yeah, no, we'll
bring you to the hospital

770
00:49:21,924 --> 00:49:22,959
right after we take
you to the sheriff.

771
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:25,754
[Dan grunting]

772
00:49:25,755 --> 00:49:29,172
- What, come on, get off me!
- I'm putting you

773
00:49:29,173 --> 00:49:31,105
under citizen's arrest.

774
00:49:31,106 --> 00:49:32,416
Now you guys better
get out of here unless

775
00:49:32,417 --> 00:49:34,798
you wanna be accessories
to this car-stealing,

776
00:49:34,799 --> 00:49:36,696
woman-abusing piece of shit!

777
00:49:36,697 --> 00:49:39,113
Stop it, no he's not!

778
00:49:39,114 --> 00:49:40,390
- Yes, he is.
- Yes, he is.

779
00:49:40,391 --> 00:49:42,599
Mandy, Mandy, let them
take him, we need to go.

780
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:44,911
The cops are gonna show up
and I'm not gonna be here.

781
00:49:44,912 --> 00:49:46,603
What, Jeff, shut
the fuck up man!

782
00:49:46,604 --> 00:49:47,845
This is what I've
been trying to tell you,

783
00:49:47,846 --> 00:49:49,675
he's nothing but
an abusive loser.

784
00:49:49,676 --> 00:49:51,573
You can do so much better.

785
00:49:51,574 --> 00:49:52,990
Let's go.

786
00:49:56,165 --> 00:49:58,857
Girl, you better not leave me!

787
00:49:59,893 --> 00:50:02,309
Mandy get back here!
- Shut up!

788
00:50:03,724 --> 00:50:04,794
[Dan] I'm gonna kick
your ass when we get home!

789
00:50:06,762 --> 00:50:09,936
[Dan mumbling]

790
00:50:09,937 --> 00:50:12,595
[Dan hollering]

791
00:50:16,634 --> 00:50:17,945
Get comfortable!

792
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:20,568
Piece of shit.
- Asshole.

793
00:50:20,569 --> 00:50:21,570
Woman abuser.

794
00:50:22,502 --> 00:50:25,160
[Dan hollering]

795
00:50:37,206 --> 00:50:40,347
[Dan breathing heavy]

796
00:50:43,730 --> 00:50:44,524
All right.

797
00:50:51,496 --> 00:50:54,120
Oh my gosh, please be careful.

798
00:50:59,849 --> 00:51:02,576
[Austin grunting]

799
00:51:05,717 --> 00:51:08,237
- No service.
- Me either.

800
00:51:10,205 --> 00:51:12,414
Well, Meghan won't
open the bathroom door.

801
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:17,763
She probably just
needs some time alone.

802
00:51:17,764 --> 00:51:19,489
That was a lot to take in.

803
00:51:19,490 --> 00:51:22,838
Some alone time doesn't sound
like a bad idea right now.

804
00:51:24,253 --> 00:51:25,529
Come.

805
00:51:25,530 --> 00:51:26,979
[Rick] Wait, where
are you guys going?

806
00:51:26,980 --> 00:51:30,155
Alone time as in
me and my girlfriend,

807
00:51:30,156 --> 00:51:32,641
not me, my girlfriend and you.

808
00:51:34,229 --> 00:51:36,576
Okay, you don't have to be rude.

809
00:51:42,651 --> 00:51:45,274
[ominous music]

810
00:52:00,738 --> 00:52:02,188
Don't be frightened
innocent one,

811
00:52:05,122 --> 00:52:10,127
you're safe here with me.

812
00:52:10,886 --> 00:52:12,301
This is our destiny.

813
00:52:21,897 --> 00:52:23,795
Lie back now young one.

814
00:52:26,971 --> 00:52:30,077
Dark master's told
me what I must do.

815
00:52:35,186 --> 00:52:37,982
[dramatic music]

816
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:51,892
Thank god we're away from him.

817
00:52:52,755 --> 00:52:54,446
- Who?
- Rick,

818
00:52:54,447 --> 00:52:56,759
he's so fucking annoying.

819
00:52:58,036 --> 00:53:01,247
- He's not that bad.
- Yes, he is.

820
00:53:02,834 --> 00:53:05,319
You know, sometimes I
wonder, do you really think

821
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:06,217
he's gay?
- What?

822
00:53:08,495 --> 00:53:11,048
He can't seem to
keep his hands off you.

823
00:53:11,049 --> 00:53:14,087
Oh come on, he's
as gay as they come.

824
00:53:16,089 --> 00:53:17,780
I think he has the hots for you.

825
00:53:20,197 --> 00:53:21,818
Do you think I could turn him?

826
00:53:21,819 --> 00:53:25,305
Maybe, you're awfully sexy.

827
00:53:26,479 --> 00:53:28,757
Why don't you show
me how sexy I am.

828
00:53:30,517 --> 00:53:32,105
Here?

829
00:53:33,486 --> 00:53:35,212
There's no one around for miles.

830
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:37,248
Good point.

831
00:53:46,188 --> 00:53:47,224
I know that look.

832
00:53:49,191 --> 00:53:52,229
Well, guess we don't
have any fuzzy handcuffs,

833
00:53:53,954 --> 00:53:55,093
guess we'll have to improvise,

834
00:53:57,544 --> 00:53:59,926
take what God's
green earth gave us.

835
00:54:00,754 --> 00:54:03,205
You're so kinky.

836
00:54:06,450 --> 00:54:08,174
Well, you know.

837
00:54:08,175 --> 00:54:10,487
[Anna giggling]

838
00:54:10,488 --> 00:54:13,733
Can't let a bad girl
like you get away.

839
00:54:24,261 --> 00:54:26,918
[ominous music]

840
00:54:31,958 --> 00:54:34,374
I love it when you do that.

841
00:54:39,759 --> 00:54:41,036
Why'd you stop?

842
00:54:44,729 --> 00:54:47,284
[Anna hollers]

843
00:54:48,664 --> 00:54:50,251
Satan.

[Anna hollers]

845
00:54:52,081 --> 00:54:53,772
I belong to you.

[Anna screaming]

847
00:54:55,602 --> 00:54:56,602
No, no, no, no!

848
00:54:56,603 --> 00:54:58,329
No, no, no, no, baby!

849
00:54:59,951 --> 00:55:03,541
Baby come on, come on,
come on, come on, no.

850
00:55:05,509 --> 00:55:06,441
No, no, no.

851
00:55:07,614 --> 00:55:08,443
No!

852
00:55:09,409 --> 00:55:10,272
No!

853
00:55:12,688 --> 00:55:13,517
No!

854
00:55:23,596 --> 00:55:24,768
No!

855
00:55:24,769 --> 00:55:25,598
No!

Oh, shit!

[James choking]

861
00:56:35,530 --> 00:56:38,222
[James gasping]

862
00:57:06,112 --> 00:57:07,389
James and Anna
should be back by now.

863
00:57:08,839 --> 00:57:11,635
I can't take this anymore,
I'm gonna go look for them.

864
00:57:16,398 --> 00:57:17,226
Come on.

865
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:27,685
Who's gonna guard the cabin?

866
00:57:31,827 --> 00:57:33,553
Fuck this man, shit.

867
00:57:34,934 --> 00:57:38,384
I don't think they
would have come this far,

868
00:57:38,385 --> 00:57:40,457
James is just too
much of a chicken.

869
00:57:41,630 --> 00:57:43,631
He was angry, I
mean, he might have

870
00:57:43,632 --> 00:57:44,461
walked back to the highway.

871
00:57:45,427 --> 00:57:47,602
Holy shit, what is that?

872
00:57:50,674 --> 00:57:53,746
What, is that blood?
- What the heck?

873
00:58:02,030 --> 00:58:05,032
Look at this picture
of Norman, can I have it?

874
00:58:05,033 --> 00:58:06,274
No, we have to stay invisible,

875
00:58:06,275 --> 00:58:07,413
keep things exactly
the way they left them

876
00:58:07,414 --> 00:58:09,070
and we can't let
anyone know we're here.

877
00:58:09,071 --> 00:58:10,555
Oh okay.

878
00:58:10,556 --> 00:58:11,936
We should probably go.

[door slams]
[girls screaming]

880
00:58:25,018 --> 00:58:26,467
Quiet, remember what Dad said,

881
00:58:26,468 --> 00:58:27,780
look for the light
and follow it.

882
00:58:37,168 --> 00:58:39,516
Oh, I miss you old friend.

883
00:58:41,069 --> 00:58:44,624
Don't worry man, I'm
here to finish your work.

884
00:58:46,799 --> 00:58:51,804
Yeah, yeah, I'll get it done.

[ominous music]

886
00:59:09,407 --> 00:59:14,066
Excuse me, yoo-hoo, over here.

887
00:59:14,067 --> 00:59:16,517
Is the spooky cabin close by?

888
00:59:16,518 --> 00:59:19,417
Spooky cabin, who told
you about a spooky cabin?

889
00:59:20,557 --> 00:59:22,281
It's one of the stops
on our hiking trail.

890
00:59:22,282 --> 00:59:24,145
What, this is private property,

891
00:59:24,146 --> 00:59:27,286
now you two get out of here.

892
00:59:27,287 --> 00:59:28,425
You don't have to be
rude, we were just trying

893
00:59:28,426 --> 00:59:30,427
to ask a question.

894
00:59:30,428 --> 00:59:33,430
You get out of here before
I make you sorry you're here.

895
00:59:33,431 --> 00:59:34,811
Get.
- Bite me,

896
00:59:34,812 --> 00:59:36,262
red state creeper.

897
00:59:39,610 --> 00:59:41,197
Did you see that trench
coat he's wearing,

898
00:59:41,198 --> 00:59:43,095
it's like 100 degrees out here.

899
00:59:43,096 --> 00:59:45,616
Let's get back to LA
where the normal people are.

900
00:59:47,514 --> 00:59:50,172
[ominous music]

901
01:00:02,529 --> 01:00:05,015
Oh, that's Anna's nose ring.

902
01:00:06,326 --> 01:00:07,120
It can't be.

903
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:10,572
Oh my god.

904
01:00:10,573 --> 01:00:12,160
- What?
- Oh my god.

905
01:00:13,402 --> 01:00:14,265
[Ashley screaming]

906
01:00:14,266 --> 01:00:15,852
- Oh, oh God!
- Oh!

907
01:00:15,853 --> 01:00:18,717
[Rita screaming]

908
01:00:18,718 --> 01:00:20,926
- Oh my god!
- Oh!

909
01:00:20,927 --> 01:00:21,928
Oh my god.

910
01:00:25,173 --> 01:00:26,623
- Oh!
- Oh my god!

911
01:00:27,485 --> 01:00:30,040
[Rick gagging]

912
01:00:33,181 --> 01:00:35,907
It's okay, it's okay.

913
01:00:35,908 --> 01:00:36,736
[Rick hollering]

914
01:00:36,736 --> 01:00:37,703
Oh god!

915
01:00:37,704 --> 01:00:40,152
Who could have done this?

916
01:00:40,153 --> 01:00:41,361
Oh god, oh god.

917
01:00:43,329 --> 01:00:45,883
[Rick hollers]

918
01:00:47,333 --> 01:00:49,541
Oh we gotta go, we
gotta go, go go!

919
01:00:49,542 --> 01:00:50,508
We gotta go!

920
01:00:52,165 --> 01:00:54,789
[ominous music]

921
01:01:15,223 --> 01:01:16,499
No sign of James anywhere.

922
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:18,501
- Maybe he got away.
- Let's hope he did.

923
01:01:18,502 --> 01:01:21,331
I can't believe
someone would hurt Anna,

924
01:01:21,332 --> 01:01:23,403
poor Anna who
wouldn't harm a fly.

925
01:01:26,165 --> 01:01:28,097
Wait, wait, wait,
no what are you doing?

926
01:01:28,098 --> 01:01:29,650
I'm letting him out.

927
01:01:29,651 --> 01:01:31,100
No, no, no, no, I don't
think that's a good idea.

928
01:01:31,101 --> 01:01:33,378
Are you serious, you can't
just leave him in there to die.

929
01:01:33,379 --> 01:01:35,933
Austin, what's gotten into you.

930
01:01:37,348 --> 01:01:39,764
If we untie him the
first thing he's gonna do

931
01:01:39,765 --> 01:01:40,697
is start a fight.

932
01:01:40,698 --> 01:01:41,870
We don't have time for that.

933
01:01:43,458 --> 01:01:45,114
He's right, Ashley, it's
just safer for everyone

934
01:01:45,115 --> 01:01:46,461
if he just stays in there.

935
01:01:48,705 --> 01:01:50,845
I can't believe you two.

936
01:02:24,741 --> 01:02:27,605
- Why what's wrong?
- I don't know.

937
01:02:42,551 --> 01:02:43,380
What?

938
01:02:58,119 --> 01:03:00,224
Guys, the car won't start.

939
01:03:03,814 --> 01:03:05,366
I never should have come here.

940
01:03:05,367 --> 01:03:07,506
All I wanted to do
was have a fun weekend

941
01:03:07,507 --> 01:03:09,405
and just meet a few new people

942
01:03:09,406 --> 01:03:11,821
and this phone, it
just won't work.

943
01:03:11,822 --> 01:03:13,719
No one knew this would happen.

944
01:03:13,720 --> 01:03:15,721
You girls were
messing with things

945
01:03:15,722 --> 01:03:17,068
that you shouldn't have.

946
01:03:17,069 --> 01:03:18,310
None of this would be
happening right now

947
01:03:18,311 --> 01:03:20,588
if it wasn't for
that seance, okay?

948
01:03:20,589 --> 01:03:23,039
We let him out and now
he's just gonna pick us off

949
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:24,800
one by one like he
did in that video.

950
01:03:24,801 --> 01:03:28,320
We still don't know
who is doing this, okay?

951
01:03:28,321 --> 01:03:29,805
For all we know someone
could have just been watching

952
01:03:29,806 --> 01:03:32,014
this place for years just
waiting for occupants

953
01:03:32,015 --> 01:03:34,223
to play their sick,
twisted games on.

954
01:03:34,224 --> 01:03:36,639
But you saw Anna, no human being

955
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:37,572
could have done that to her.

956
01:03:37,573 --> 01:03:39,607
I don't know what to think.

957
01:03:39,608 --> 01:03:42,058
Yeah, but there is always
a rational explanation

958
01:03:42,059 --> 01:03:44,268
for everything, none
of this is real.

959
01:03:47,237 --> 01:03:49,134
You said you believed it.

960
01:03:49,135 --> 01:03:50,826
I told you what you
wanted to hear, okay?

961
01:03:50,827 --> 01:03:53,035
[Ashley] You mean
you never believed me?

962
01:03:53,036 --> 01:03:54,968
It's just what
boyfriends do, okay,

963
01:03:54,969 --> 01:03:56,970
they bend the truth once
in awhile if it makes

964
01:03:56,971 --> 01:03:58,281
your loved ones feel better.

965
01:03:58,282 --> 01:04:01,975
It's just a little white
lie, it's no harm done.

966
01:04:01,976 --> 01:04:03,424
Ashley, Ashley
where are you going?

967
01:04:03,425 --> 01:04:05,462
I'm checking on Meghan,
okay, she needs me.

968
01:04:15,886 --> 01:04:17,853
We need to figure
out what to do.

969
01:04:17,854 --> 01:04:20,027
Night is approaching
and we're 30 miles away

970
01:04:20,028 --> 01:04:21,787
from civilization.

971
01:04:21,788 --> 01:04:23,997
Are you sure we
can't start the car?

972
01:04:23,998 --> 01:04:27,415
There's no battery,
Greg, someone took it.

973
01:04:31,626 --> 01:04:36,631
No, no, we stay here
and we hike out at dawn.

974
01:04:38,391 --> 01:04:40,634
If we stay then we're
just sitting ducks,

975
01:04:40,635 --> 01:04:42,498
okay, why don't we just
hike back to the highway

976
01:04:42,499 --> 01:04:44,777
and walk all night if
it takes us that long?

977
01:04:46,192 --> 01:04:47,675
No, we're safer here.

978
01:04:47,676 --> 01:04:52,681
Whoever killed Anna
is still out there

979
01:04:55,098 --> 01:04:59,032
and we have weapons
for protection.

980
01:04:59,033 --> 01:05:02,968
And we stay put and we
hike out at first light.

981
01:05:04,107 --> 01:05:07,350
Weapons, what weapons, this?

982
01:05:07,351 --> 01:05:10,113
[metal clanking]

983
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:23,298
[ominous music]

984
01:05:27,509 --> 01:05:30,167
[Dan hollering]

985
01:05:32,929 --> 01:05:35,621
[Dan hollering]

986
01:05:44,733 --> 01:05:47,391
[ominous music]

987
01:05:50,947 --> 01:05:55,952
[blood splatters]
[Dan moaning]

988
01:06:05,271 --> 01:06:06,582
Did you lock the kitchen window?

989
01:06:06,583 --> 01:06:09,585
- I locked it.
- Is everything else secure?

990
01:06:09,586 --> 01:06:10,863
As secure as can be.

991
01:06:13,348 --> 01:06:16,558
Nobody's gonna be able to reach
us here, we're too high up.

992
01:06:19,906 --> 01:06:21,286
How's she doing?

993
01:06:21,287 --> 01:06:22,806
- She's a little.
- I'm fine.

994
01:06:29,226 --> 01:06:33,437
Anna, I can't believe it.

995
01:06:35,784 --> 01:06:38,372
- Any word on James?
- Nothing.

996
01:06:38,373 --> 01:06:39,719
We've gotta do something.

997
01:06:43,620 --> 01:06:45,760
Before there were some
bullets for that gun.

998
01:06:47,003 --> 01:06:48,935
Yeah, there might
be some somewhere.

999
01:06:51,421 --> 01:06:53,112
Let's split up into groups
and search the house.

1000
01:07:08,714 --> 01:07:11,544
[climactic music]

1001
01:07:14,340 --> 01:07:17,067
[couple gasping]

1002
01:07:29,010 --> 01:07:31,909
[couple screaming]

1003
01:07:37,363 --> 01:07:40,090
[Jeff screaming]

1004
01:07:41,160 --> 01:07:44,542
[Jeff's girlfriend screaming]

1005
01:07:44,543 --> 01:07:48,477
[Jeff's girlfriend screaming]

1006
01:07:48,478 --> 01:07:51,136
[Jeff gurgling]

1007
01:07:52,137 --> 01:07:56,726
[Jeff's girlfriend screaming]

1008
01:07:56,727 --> 01:07:59,282
[Jeff gasping]

1009
01:08:10,776 --> 01:08:12,191
- Any luck?
- No.

1010
01:08:14,469 --> 01:08:17,576
Oh I think I see
something outside.

1011
01:08:23,202 --> 01:08:27,723
[door knocking]
[group hollers]

1012
01:08:27,724 --> 01:08:29,104
What is that?

1013
01:08:29,105 --> 01:08:32,141
- No, don't let it in.
- What, it?

1014
01:08:32,142 --> 01:08:33,591
No, no, no, what
if it was James?

1015
01:08:33,592 --> 01:08:35,869
Please, don't open the door,

1016
01:08:35,870 --> 01:08:37,802
you have to trust me okay?

1017
01:08:37,803 --> 01:08:40,185
Ashley, we need to
do a protection spell.

1018
01:08:44,499 --> 01:08:46,674
What's gotten into this?

1019
01:09:07,281 --> 01:09:12,044
We need to paint this symbol
next to every entry point.

1020
01:10:02,059 --> 01:10:06,201
You know, I was just
thinking the shed had

1021
01:10:06,202 --> 01:10:11,207
some better weapons,
saws, drills, power tools.

1022
01:10:12,380 --> 01:10:13,209
It's not safe out there.

1023
01:10:16,004 --> 01:10:17,385
I think it's worth a shot.

1024
01:10:18,283 --> 01:10:19,215
I'll go with you.

1025
01:10:37,543 --> 01:10:39,786
The spell won't protect
us unless we remain inside.

1026
01:10:39,787 --> 01:10:43,756
She's right, we're only
protected in this cabin.

1027
01:10:57,943 --> 01:11:00,532
[ominous music]

1028
01:11:14,235 --> 01:11:16,478
[person gagging]

1029
01:11:16,479 --> 01:11:19,171
[door slamming]

1030
01:11:36,326 --> 01:11:37,327
Damn kids.

1031
01:11:44,783 --> 01:11:46,853
Dispatch come in,
this is officer 299,

1032
01:11:46,854 --> 01:11:50,271
I have a 502 about
three miles north

1033
01:11:52,515 --> 01:11:53,309
of I-37 Park Bench Grill.

1034
01:11:54,689 --> 01:11:58,521
Possible 503 intoxication,
dispatch two over.

1035
01:12:00,695 --> 01:12:03,940
[Dispatch] Copy 299,
you need a bus, over.

1036
01:12:04,975 --> 01:12:07,046
Negative, dispatch, car's empty.

1037
01:12:08,634 --> 01:12:10,671
Starting a 10 mile
perimeter search over.

1038
01:12:22,786 --> 01:12:23,615
Damn kids.

1039
01:12:41,805 --> 01:12:43,151
Salt keeps out evil spirits.

1040
01:12:46,569 --> 01:12:48,225
- Oh my god, are you okay?
- I'm fine.

1041
01:12:52,989 --> 01:12:53,990
What about the guy in the shed?

1042
01:12:55,336 --> 01:12:56,130
He's uh.

1043
01:13:02,826 --> 01:13:04,033
So what do we do now?

1044
01:13:04,034 --> 01:13:05,242
We wait.

1045
01:13:12,180 --> 01:13:13,318
[door banging]

1046
01:13:13,319 --> 01:13:15,528
Help, let me in [indistinct]!

1047
01:13:15,529 --> 01:13:18,703
Well, we can't just
leave her out there.

1048
01:13:18,704 --> 01:13:23,157
I don't think that's such
a good idea, wait Austin.

1049
01:13:26,402 --> 01:13:28,437
He killed Jeff!

1050
01:13:28,438 --> 01:13:33,235
He pulled him away [indistinct].

1051
01:13:33,236 --> 01:13:35,375
I tried to hide but he found me.

1052
01:13:35,376 --> 01:13:37,791
He's been chasing me all night!

1053
01:13:37,792 --> 01:13:39,931
What about the
girl you were with?

1054
01:13:39,932 --> 01:13:42,417
We got separated I lost her.

1055
01:13:42,418 --> 01:13:44,246
And I saw your friend.

1056
01:13:44,247 --> 01:13:46,973
- James?
- Yes.

1057
01:13:46,974 --> 01:13:49,424
Lying in a ditch, he's dead.

1058
01:13:49,425 --> 01:13:50,735
- Oh my god.
- What?

1059
01:13:50,736 --> 01:13:55,741
No.
[teens crying]

1060
01:14:01,333 --> 01:14:03,230
[girl screaming]

1061
01:14:03,231 --> 01:14:04,060

This is all Esner's doing
and he wants us to do that.

1071
01:15:25,210 --> 01:15:30,077
So, he's just out there
killing and maiming our friends

1072
01:15:31,285 --> 01:15:32,182
and there's nothing
we can do about it?

1073
01:15:33,390 --> 01:15:36,392
We let him out, how
do we send him back.

1074
01:15:36,393 --> 01:15:38,498
Yeah, is there like
some way to recapture him?

1075
01:15:38,499 --> 01:15:42,882
There's spells but we've
never done anything like that.

1076
01:15:42,883 --> 01:15:44,884
Here we go, an entrapment spell.

1077
01:15:44,885 --> 01:15:45,713
What's that?

1078
01:15:47,543 --> 01:15:49,095
It's a spell to
capture a spirit.

1079
01:15:49,096 --> 01:15:51,269
We need to put a
soul into the item

1080

1083
01:16:01,039 --> 01:16:02,280
Now we just need
something to seal it with.

1084
01:16:02,281 --> 01:16:04,041
So once he's in
he can't get out.

was crazy but I didn't.

I saw something different,
misunderstood genius, a hero.

1119
01:19:45,401 --> 01:19:49,508
When I first moved over
here, no one noticed me,

1120
01:19:50,475 --> 01:19:51,476
but Norman did.

1121
01:19:52,857 --> 01:19:55,618
He could have kicked me off his
property but he let me stay.

taught me things no one else

I'm the one who
brought Norman back.

I collected some of
his blood in this vile.

1128
01:20:16,639 --> 01:20:18,019
And I made a promise to him

1129
01:20:18,020 --> 01:20:20,987
that I kept and I brought
him back, not you.

is inside Meghan's body,

then tied them and bagged them.

1135
01:20:49,465 --> 01:20:51,846
And then when they woke up,
I let them try and run away
