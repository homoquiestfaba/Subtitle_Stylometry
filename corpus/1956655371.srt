1
00:00:00,504 --> 00:00:03,337
(classical music)

2
00:01:14,008 --> 00:01:19,008
(radio static and mumbling)
(sirens wailing)

3
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:32,379
>> Ready for another one?

4
00:01:32,379 --> 00:01:34,100
>> Ready as I'm gonna be.

5
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:37,930
>> Landlord: I figured
something wasn't right.

6
00:01:46,041 --> 00:01:47,705
(knocking on door)

7
00:01:47,705 --> 00:01:50,705
>> LAPD, come out with your hands up.

8
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:14,863
>> Clear.

9
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:19,270
Ah shit.

10
00:02:20,277 --> 00:02:21,670
>> What?

11
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:22,840
>> We got a body.

12
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,673
>> What?

13
00:02:27,501 --> 00:02:30,251
(dramatic music)

14
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:38,140
>> Let's get out and secure
the room, call homicide.

15
00:03:10,404 --> 00:03:12,050
>> Do you have the young man's name?

16
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:13,940
>> Yeah, just moved in this morning.

17
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:16,000
>> Did he mention if he
had any family in the area?

18
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,833
>> I don't remember

19
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:19,110
but I can call his references if you like.

20
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:19,943
>> That'd be great.

21
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:23,822
And once the move was over,

22
00:03:23,822 --> 00:03:26,980
did you notice anything unusual
coming from the apartment?

23
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:29,040
>> No, I just saw the blood, that's all.

24
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:29,890
>> Here's my card.

25
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:32,280
I'll put the case number on it.

26
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:34,940
Call me if you find anything.

27
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:36,080
>> Okay.

28
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,582
You guys are gonna be
here for awhile, right?

29
00:03:37,582 --> 00:03:39,652
>> Dave: Yeah, yeah.

30
00:03:39,652 --> 00:03:41,985
>> Landlord: Okay.

31
00:03:41,985 --> 00:03:45,050
>> I just got word that the
FBI are coming to the scene.

32
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:45,998
>> Why?

33
00:03:45,998 --> 00:03:48,290
>> Apparently there was
some similar murders

34
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:49,560
in Oregon last month.

35
00:03:50,845 --> 00:03:54,090
>> I didn't hear anything about that.

36
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:55,180
>> Me neither.

37
00:03:56,174 --> 00:03:58,024
They probably tried to keep it quiet.

38
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:01,870
They said it was three weeks ago, same MO.

39
00:04:04,345 --> 00:04:06,595
I'll go to the front
door and let homicide in

40
00:04:07,576 --> 00:04:09,400
but it's gonna be awhile.

41
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,140
You don't mind the overtime?

42
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:12,500
>> No, no, no problem.

43
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,350
>> We haven't touched a thing,

44
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:38,501
just walked in, confirmed there
was a body and walked out.

45
00:04:38,501 --> 00:04:39,334
>> Okay.

46
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:44,130
Holy shit.

47
00:04:50,325 --> 00:04:51,903
>> The FBI is right behind us.

48
00:04:51,903 --> 00:04:52,736
>> Okay.

49
00:05:14,808 --> 00:05:16,458
>> This is Agent Taylor,

50
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:18,911
he's a psychic based out of Virginia.

51
00:05:18,911 --> 00:05:22,837
Agency holds his abilities in high regard

52
00:05:22,837 --> 00:05:25,640
so we had him come out
here and help with the case

53
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,650
which may be related
to a series of murders

54
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:29,610
we had in Oregon last month.

55
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,193
>> If we're gonna be here awhile,

56
00:05:33,193 --> 00:05:34,240
let's get some coffee.

57
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:43,150
>> Sorry, am I in the way?

58
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:43,983
>> Not at all.

59
00:05:45,034 --> 00:05:47,384
You haven't been doing
this job long, have you?

60
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:49,323
>> No.

61
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:54,180
>> You live alone, interested in sports

62
00:05:55,264 --> 00:05:56,930
and you have a secret.

63
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:02,120
>> I've got a report to write up.

64
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:07,120
>> I'm Robbie Taylor, nice
to meet you Officer Harris.

65
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:13,660
>> Dave, Dave Harris.

66
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:15,760
>> Agent Skinner: Taylor, let's go.

67
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,770
>> I'll be right there.

68
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:19,040
We'll meet again.

69
00:06:33,539 --> 00:06:36,000
>> So you're a psychic, huh?

70
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,677
>> Yeah, they call me in to
help with difficult cases.

71
00:06:39,677 --> 00:06:42,449
>> Never met a real psychic before.

72
00:06:42,449 --> 00:06:44,320
>> The feeling's mutual.

73
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:46,533
>> What?

74
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,010
>> I've got some more work to do inside

75
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:50,862
once the coroner removes the body.

76
00:06:50,862 --> 00:06:54,520
But like I said before,
I'll see you again.

77
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:58,440
Call me, day or night.

78
00:07:00,502 --> 00:07:03,720
And don't worry, your
secret's safe with me.

79
00:07:06,563 --> 00:07:07,396
>> Eric: There you are.

80
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:10,960
>> Nice working with you, Officer Harris.

81
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:17,780
>> Hey Eric.

82
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:18,871
>> So how bad was it?

83
00:07:18,871 --> 00:07:21,010
>> Bad.

84
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:21,880
>> The hell's going on?

85
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,990
What's with all the murders suddenly?

86
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:25,390
>> Yeah, they're crazy right?

87
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,450
>> Catch one murderer,
another one pops up.

88
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:34,740
Who's the suit?

89
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:35,850
Is he one of ours?

90
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:36,683
>> FBI.

91
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,160
There were some similar murders in Oregon.

92
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:44,450
They think it's the same guy, similar MO.

93
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:47,570
>> Alright Harris, time
for you to head home,

94
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:49,700
you worked enough overtime for one day.

95
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:50,960
>> Hey, I was just watching the scene

96
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,646
until homicide and the FBI showed up.

97
00:07:53,646 --> 00:07:54,920
I don't know what they'll
need you for but--

98
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,382
>> I'm not helping the
coroner lift the body,

99
00:07:57,382 --> 00:07:58,427
that's for damn sure.

100
00:07:58,427 --> 00:08:00,760
>> Dave: Okay, I'll see you.

101
00:08:48,446 --> 00:08:49,974
>> Dave!

102
00:08:49,974 --> 00:08:51,307
Dave, what's up?

103
00:08:52,705 --> 00:08:55,320
What do you think of the FBI profile?

104
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,600
>> White male, age 30,
50, tall average built.

105
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,610
>> Yeah, that's the one.

106
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:01,090
>> Could be anyone, right?

107
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:02,922
>> Right, except you and me.

108
00:09:02,922 --> 00:09:04,820
Hey, I'mma see you around.

109
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:05,653
>> See you man.

110
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:10,880
>> Dispatcher: Seven Lincoln 60.

111
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,170
>> Officer: Seven Lincoln 60.

112
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:14,120
>> Dispatcher: Meet seven Lincoln 48

113
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,498
at the location on your screen.

114
00:09:15,498 --> 00:09:17,964
You copy, seven Lincoln 48?

115
00:09:17,964 --> 00:09:19,420
>> Ten four.

116
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,258
This is insane.

117
00:09:29,258 --> 00:09:30,880
>> We should go public with the info,

118
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,690
and ask the community for help.

119
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:34,250
Keeping it secret isn't helping anyone.

120
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:35,800
>> Yeah, except the killer.

121
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,693
Hey, maybe you could talk to the captain.

122
00:09:38,693 --> 00:09:39,830
>> Yeah...

123
00:09:42,042 --> 00:09:43,270
You ready?

124
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:44,880
>> Yeah.

125
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,713
>> Let's go.

126
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:53,060
Hello mam, I'm Sergeant Wilson,

127
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:54,317
this is Officer Harris,

128
00:09:54,317 --> 00:09:57,133
we'd like to ask you
a couple of questions.

129
00:09:57,133 --> 00:09:57,966
>> You have any information

130
00:09:57,966 --> 00:09:59,470
on the young man that was
renting the apartment?

131
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:00,762
>> It wasn't occupied.

132
00:10:00,762 --> 00:10:02,050
The door was unlocked

133
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:03,860
so I guess that's how they got in.

134
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:05,270
I was gonna show it this afternoon

135
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:07,430
but then I saw blood on the door.

136
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:09,113
>> Did you see anybody?

137
00:10:09,113 --> 00:10:12,293
>> There were two men who
came in earlier today.

138
00:10:12,293 --> 00:10:13,810
I didn't know them

139
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:16,207
but I figured they were
going to visit a friend.

140
00:10:16,207 --> 00:10:17,807
>> Do you remember anything about them?

141
00:10:17,807 --> 00:10:19,663
>> One was a young Asian man,

142
00:10:19,663 --> 00:10:23,141
the other was white, maybe 30's.

143
00:10:23,141 --> 00:10:24,719
>> Anything else?

144
00:10:24,719 --> 00:10:26,550
>> He was kind of tall.

145
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:30,150
>> Would you recognize him if you saw him?

146
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,374
>> I think so.

147
00:10:31,374 --> 00:10:36,020
He was kind of weird, lots
of clothing, too much.

148
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:38,778
>> Did they have a car?

149
00:10:38,778 --> 00:10:43,180
>> Something light I
think, four doors, I think.

150
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:45,390
They parked where you are.

151
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:47,933
This is it.

152
00:10:50,822 --> 00:10:52,000
>> Both: Thank you.

153
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,250
>> LAPD, come out now.

154
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:12,533
Clear.

155
00:11:17,391 --> 00:11:18,224
Clear.

156
00:11:22,082 --> 00:11:24,165
(grunts)

157
00:11:26,309 --> 00:11:27,142
Don't.

158
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:33,573
Bolder.

159
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:42,110
>> They're leaving clues.

160
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,770
>> Sergeant Wilson: We could use 'em.

161
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:56,580
>> Tell the captain to put
some info out on this man.

162
00:12:05,168 --> 00:12:08,729
>> Word is most of these
young men are prostitutes,

163
00:12:08,729 --> 00:12:11,070
killer picks them up off the street.

164
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:14,180
So the FBI isn't in a hurry

165
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:16,430
to alert the general public for no reason.

166
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:17,730
>> They're still human beings.

167
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:21,080
>> The whole homo thing
makes everyone nervous.

168
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:25,560
I'll go let the detectives in,

169
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,120
stay put and guard the door.

170
00:12:38,892 --> 00:12:40,140
>> Dave: Do you have any suspects yet?

171
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:41,480
>> Agent Skinner: Too soon.

172
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:03,041
>> Told you we'd meet again.

173
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:07,990
>> Hey, you're good,
you're good, you're good.

174
00:13:18,228 --> 00:13:20,160
>> So everyone's upstairs?

175
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:20,993
>> Yeah.

176
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,418
The landlady saw the guy.

177
00:13:28,418 --> 00:13:31,554
Her description matches
the bureau's profile.

178
00:13:31,554 --> 00:13:33,490
>> Is she still here?

179
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:34,323
>> Yeah.

180
00:13:39,201 --> 00:13:42,150
>> I'll let homicide know
we have an eye witness.

181
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:43,800
Put what you've got down in your report,

182
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,189
same as you did yesterday.

183
00:13:45,189 --> 00:13:47,839
We'll try to get a composite
sketch from her as well.

184
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:57,653
>> He wants you to think you've got him.

185
00:13:57,653 --> 00:14:00,210
He's beginning to play.

186
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:02,750
>> What if the landlady can ID him?

187
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,260
>> She can't.

188
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,590
He's never been handled before,

189
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:07,659
the police don't know him,

190
00:14:07,659 --> 00:14:10,040
he's new to the area.

191
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,920
>> What about the word dragon?

192
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,626
>> That's about his
attraction to Asian men.

193
00:14:14,626 --> 00:14:17,120
>> Why do you think he's doing this?

194
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,390
>> Guilt.

195
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:19,777
He wanted to have sex with these guys

196
00:14:19,777 --> 00:14:23,125
and then probably got scared
that someone would find out

197
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:25,760
so he started killing them.

198
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:30,280
His routine is one a day
and then he moves on.

199
00:14:31,444 --> 00:14:34,270
These killers are really
OCD about their deeds.

200
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:42,760
>> What?

201
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,657
>> You want to grab a
coffee after we finish?

202
00:14:44,657 --> 00:14:47,370
>> Oh, I don't know.

203
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,700
>> You're not comfortable
in the open, I get it.

204
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:53,140
Your place, mine?

205
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:54,440
>> Oh shit man.

206
00:14:56,082 --> 00:14:59,920
>> I'm sorry, I thought
you were interested.

207
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,467
>> I am.

208
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:03,002
>> If I'm moving too
fast it's only because

209
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:05,402
you wouldn't want to be
seen together in public.

210
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:07,975
>> You like black men?

211
00:15:07,975 --> 00:15:11,780
>> I like men in general,
you in particular.

212
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:16,280
>> I never really done this before.

213
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:18,625
>> Hey, we're just gonna hang out,

214
00:15:18,625 --> 00:15:21,313
get to know each other, see what happens.

215
00:15:21,313 --> 00:15:22,560
Okay?

216
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:26,650
>> It's probably better
if I come to your place.

217
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:27,878
>> Not a problem.

218
00:15:27,878 --> 00:15:29,995
They rented me a place in Hollywood.

219
00:15:29,995 --> 00:15:31,973
You still got my card?

220
00:15:31,973 --> 00:15:34,960
Text me later and I'll
send you the address.

221
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,610
When are you off next?

222
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:37,970
>> Tomorrow.

223
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:39,659
>> Come after work.

224
00:15:39,659 --> 00:15:41,740
>> My sergeant's coming, I'll text you.

225
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,770
>> Did you finish that report?

226
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:49,730
>> Yeah.

227
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:52,490
You want me to copy
everyone I did last time?

228
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:56,870
>> Yeah, then go home.

229
00:16:39,368 --> 00:16:42,035
(phone ringing)

230
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:55,810
>> Hello.

231
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:58,010
>> Robbie: I'm looking
forward to tomorrow night too.

232
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:01,060
>> Reading my mind again, huh?

233
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:03,092
>> Robbie: I'll text you
my address right now.

234
00:17:03,092 --> 00:17:04,450
Sleep well.

235
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:27,330
>> Dispatcher: Seven Lincoln
48 on 1195, ten four.

236
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:28,470
Suspect with shorts.

237
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:29,570
Give me your message.

238
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:31,454
>> Officer: It's a
burglary for motor vehicle.

239
00:17:31,454 --> 00:17:32,287
>> Dispatcher: Description, please.

240
00:17:32,287 --> 00:17:34,620
>> Officer: Male Hispanic,
about five six, 160.

241
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:38,953
(officers mumbling over each other)

242
00:18:03,864 --> 00:18:07,150
>> License, registration and
proof of insurance, please.

243
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:09,170
>> What'd I do wrong, officer?

244
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:10,120
>> Broken taillight.

245
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:13,803
>> Yeah.

246
00:18:25,712 --> 00:18:26,712
Here you go.

247
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:31,870
>> I'll be right back.

248
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,460
>> Dispatcher: Seven Lincoln 60.

249
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:56,758
>> Officer: Seven Lincoln 60.

250
00:18:56,758 --> 00:18:58,341
>> Dispatcher: Seven Lincoln 44,

251
00:18:58,341 --> 00:19:01,290
meet seven Lincoln 60 at
the location on your screen.

252
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:02,651
>> Seven Lincoln 48.

253
00:19:02,651 --> 00:19:04,550
>> Dispatcher: Seven Lincoln 48.

254
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:06,330
>> Radio, I'll be done
with my stop in a minute,

255
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:07,950
just give it to me.

256
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:10,050
>> Dispatcher: Ten four, seven Lincoln 48.

257
00:19:10,885 --> 00:19:13,302
(rock music)

258
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:17,380
>> Dave: Here you go.

259
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:20,010
There's your license and
get your taillight fixed.

260
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:21,510
>> Oh, thank you, will Officer.

261
00:19:28,699 --> 00:19:33,366
>> Dispatcher: Suspect with
shorts, five, six, one, two.

262
00:19:40,811 --> 00:19:43,311
(tense music)

263
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,250
>> Agent Taylor.

264
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:55,710
>> How can I help you, Officer?

265
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:57,410
>> I didn't want to disturb you in there

266
00:19:57,410 --> 00:19:58,510
but did the detectives tell you

267
00:19:58,510 --> 00:20:00,254
about the money the manager gave me?

268
00:20:00,254 --> 00:20:02,132
I think the suspect
might've touched it too.

269
00:20:02,132 --> 00:20:04,490
>> Yeah, unfortunately,
it's not gonna help us.

270
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:07,050
There's gonna be a million
fingerprints on that money.

271
00:20:08,694 --> 00:20:09,980
See you around nine?

272
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:13,950
>> Yeah, I'll call you
when I'm almost there

273
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:15,000
so you can let me in.

274
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,410
>> See you then.

275
00:20:27,179 --> 00:20:28,250
>> Hot date tonight?

276
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:31,570
>> Uh, yeah, a date.

277
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:33,180
>> Good for you, man, have fun, bro.

278
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:35,090
>> Have a good weekend, man.

279
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:35,923
>> Thanks.

280
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:42,710
See you guys.

281
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:43,920
>> Alright, take it easy, bro.

282
00:20:45,622 --> 00:20:47,222
Hey, you got some deodorant
I could use to freshen up?

283
00:20:47,222 --> 00:20:48,055
>> No.

284
00:20:49,014 --> 00:20:51,597
(steamy music)

285
00:20:59,505 --> 00:21:02,172
(phone ringing)

286
00:21:03,566 --> 00:21:05,120
>> Hey, are you here?

287
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,320
>> Dave: I'm at the gate.

288
00:21:17,819 --> 00:21:18,690
>> Welcome.

289
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:20,670
>> Thanks.

290
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,670
>> You can put your gun down over there.

291
00:21:27,203 --> 00:21:29,353
>> How do you always
know what I'm thinking?

292
00:21:31,555 --> 00:21:33,320
>> I'm a psychic.

293
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,120
>> Yeah, but how does that work?

294
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:41,210
>> If I told you, you'd blow my cover.

295
00:21:46,397 --> 00:21:48,870
>> I won't, I promise.

296
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:01,230
>> I study human nature.

297
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:03,380
I don't read minds, per say,

298
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:06,483
I just understand they way people behave

299
00:22:06,483 --> 00:22:07,980
and the way they think.

300
00:22:08,842 --> 00:22:12,560
It's not a trick, it's just common sense.

301
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:15,336
>> Does the FBI know

302
00:22:15,336 --> 00:22:19,790
or do they think you hear
voices and see spirits?

303
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:22,611
>> They have a feeling I'm
just being clever and observant

304
00:22:22,611 --> 00:22:25,710
but they boast about me as if
I were some sort of profit.

305
00:22:26,685 --> 00:22:29,070
I'd hate to blow their illusions.

306
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:30,867
>> You solve a lot of crimes?

307
00:22:30,867 --> 00:22:33,747
>> Yeah, I help solve a bunch.

308
00:22:33,747 --> 00:22:37,400
I did all my studying in
abnormal human behavior.

309
00:22:39,476 --> 00:22:43,550
Like I said, it's just
about being observant

310
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:45,410
and understanding the human mind.

311
00:22:45,410 --> 00:22:48,200
They all have patterns, profiles.

312
00:22:50,031 --> 00:22:52,390
>> I'm impressed.

313
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:53,480
I don't know how many times

314
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,010
I thought you were reading my mind.

315
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:56,880
>> You'd be surprised
by how much information

316
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,270
a person gives about themselves

317
00:22:58,270 --> 00:23:02,700
just from facial
expressions, body language.

318
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,480
>> I've never thought of it like that.

319
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:13,210
Is that how you knew I was open to--

320
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:14,647
>> Me?

321
00:23:14,647 --> 00:23:15,660
>> Yeah.

322
00:23:17,957 --> 00:23:19,840
>> You weren't shy when
you were checking me out

323
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:20,730
the first day we met.

324
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:22,130
>> I didn't check you out.

325
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:24,730
>> You may not have
thought so but you did.

326
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,910
>> I gotta be more careful.

327
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:31,550
Do that to the wrong guy...

328
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:32,813
>> Don't worry.

329
00:23:32,813 --> 00:23:36,920
I doubt many men are tuned
in enough to catch it.

330
00:23:38,786 --> 00:23:39,736
I'm just glad I am.

331
00:23:41,215 --> 00:23:43,965
(romantic music)

332
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:09,953
>> What?

333
00:25:15,701 --> 00:25:17,509
>> Follow me.

334
00:25:17,509 --> 00:25:20,259
(romantic music)

335
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,080
Damn, you're sexy.

336
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,430
>> Yeah, you're one to talk.

337
00:26:03,149 --> 00:26:05,899
(romantic music)

338
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:55,710
>> Let's take these off.

339
00:28:17,744 --> 00:28:18,577
>> Damn.

340
00:28:19,505 --> 00:28:21,471
>> You like it?

341
00:28:21,471 --> 00:28:22,304
>> Yeah.

342
00:29:05,892 --> 00:29:08,059
>> Now let's get you naked.

343
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:09,930
>> Sure, sure.

344
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:13,210
>> Do you not want to do this?

345
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:21,040
>> I am, I just, I've never
done this before and...

346
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:25,790
>> Don't worry, I'll take the lead.

347
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:47,533
>> You have to get up early tomorrow?

348
00:30:47,533 --> 00:30:48,760
>> Yeah.

349
00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:51,280
>> What time?

350
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,113
>> Eightish.

351
00:30:54,423 --> 00:30:55,256
>> I'm off tomorrow.

352
00:30:55,256 --> 00:30:56,089
>> I remember.

353
00:30:57,645 --> 00:31:01,210
Too bad we couldn't take off
and hit the beach together.

354
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:02,043
>> I know

355
00:31:02,043 --> 00:31:03,820
but you're here to solve a case.

356
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,410
How many people were killed in Oregon?

357
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:12,960
>> Robbie: 20.

358
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,270
>> You're kidding, right?

359
00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:15,570
>> I wish I was.

360
00:31:15,570 --> 00:31:17,069
>> Dave: One a night?

361
00:31:17,069 --> 00:31:18,610
>> For 20 nights.

362
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:20,460
And then he stopped.

363
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:25,470
That's when we suspect he
had a cooling off period.

364
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:27,284
>> And then came here.

365
00:31:27,284 --> 00:31:29,130
Did it start in Oregon?

366
00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:32,919
>> San Francisco, as far as we know,

367
00:31:32,919 --> 00:31:35,071
the same pattern to a tee.

368
00:31:35,071 --> 00:31:37,030
>> Dave: How many there?

369
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:38,657
>> 20.

370
00:31:38,657 --> 00:31:43,657
>> God, I can't handle
20, it was bad enough.

371
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,030
How is he not getting caught?

372
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:49,370
>> He's smart and he knows how we work.

373
00:31:49,370 --> 00:31:51,960
>> Which is why everyone
thinks he's an ex cop.

374
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:56,852
>> Ex agent, ex cop, ex
evidence tech, ex something.

375
00:31:56,852 --> 00:31:58,550
And we still have no idea

376
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:01,150
where he puts his bloody
clothing after each murder.

377
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:04,630
None of the witnesses have ever
seen him carrying anything.

378
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:05,870
>> Well, the landlady I talked to

379
00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:07,170
said that he wears a lot of clothes.

380
00:32:07,170 --> 00:32:09,015
>> More things to get rid of, right?

381
00:32:09,015 --> 00:32:10,730
It's weird.

382
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:13,500
>> 40 victims, that's just insane.

383
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,280
>> That we're aware of.

384
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,340
Sometimes we don't find
out until after the arrest

385
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:20,550
that we've completely
underestimated the body count.

386
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:21,720
>> Have you guys ever tried using a decoy,

387
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:26,470
an off duty officer who
fits the description?

388
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:28,194
>> I haven't been on this case that long

389
00:32:28,194 --> 00:32:30,561
but yes, we've tried everything.

390
00:32:30,561 --> 00:32:32,978
It's like he's privy to inside info,

391
00:32:32,978 --> 00:32:35,090
he's always a step ahead of us

392
00:32:35,090 --> 00:32:40,034
and there's never a trace of
forensic evidence anywhere.

393
00:32:40,034 --> 00:32:42,300
I should get some sleep.

394
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:57,910
Morning, handsome.

395
00:32:57,910 --> 00:32:58,743
>> Morning.

396
00:33:06,962 --> 00:33:08,480
>> Time to get up.

397
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,720
>> Not so fast, mister.

398
00:33:23,816 --> 00:33:25,050
>> Robbie: Did I mention my colleagues

399
00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:26,250
are right down the hall?

400
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:28,433
>> No.

401
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:31,995
>> Agent Green and Agent
Skinner, they're roomies.

402
00:33:31,995 --> 00:33:34,407
>> Wait, they're not?

403
00:33:34,407 --> 00:33:35,970
>> Oh, hell no.

404
00:33:35,970 --> 00:33:37,220
>> I didn't think so.

405
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:39,210
>> Skinner's going through a divorce

406
00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:41,110
and he's staying with Green temporarily.

407
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:43,200
This place became
available and they just...

408
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,010
>> Makes it easy I guess.

409
00:33:45,010 --> 00:33:49,096
>> Yeah, except for unplanned
situations like this.

410
00:33:49,096 --> 00:33:52,120
>> We'll just have to be discrete.

411
00:33:54,684 --> 00:33:55,900
Will I see you again?

412
00:33:58,161 --> 00:33:59,540
>> How 'bout tonight?

413
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:08,013
>> See you later.

414
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,258
>> We got some DNA results
from the first crime scene,

415
00:34:20,258 --> 00:34:21,660
no matches found.

416
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:23,031
>> So it wasn't the suspect?

417
00:34:23,031 --> 00:34:24,140
>> Correct.

418
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:25,780
So I doubt it'll be any help.

419
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:27,690
>> These run down buildings
are loaded with DNA

420
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:29,220
from every tenant who's lived in 'em.

421
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:30,130
>> You mean they don't
steam clean in between?

422
00:34:30,130 --> 00:34:33,150
>> This fucker's really
getting on my nerves.

423
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:34,477
>> Yeah, it's killing him too.

424
00:34:34,477 --> 00:34:36,781
He hates himself for doing it,

425
00:34:36,781 --> 00:34:39,127
even though he can't stop himself.

426
00:34:39,127 --> 00:34:41,130
>> You sound sympathetic?

427
00:34:41,130 --> 00:34:42,537
>> Hardly.

428
00:34:42,537 --> 00:34:43,522
>> We need something concrete.

429
00:34:43,522 --> 00:34:46,600
So far all of your speculation
has gotten us nowhere.

430
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,410
>> Look, just because your wife's

431
00:34:48,410 --> 00:34:49,980
sucking some other guy's cock,

432
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:51,270
doesn't mean you can take it out on me.

433
00:34:51,270 --> 00:34:52,103
>> I never told you that.

434
00:34:52,103 --> 00:34:53,380
>> You didn't have to.

435
00:34:55,410 --> 00:34:56,559
Stop the car.

436
00:34:56,559 --> 00:34:59,309
(dramatic music)

437
00:35:12,175 --> 00:35:13,070
>> What?

438
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:14,120
What, what is it?

439
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:15,160
>> I saw them.

440
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:15,993
>> You what?

441
00:35:15,993 --> 00:35:18,630
>> Our eyes met and he just
took off down the alley.

442
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:20,490
>> How the hell do you know it was him?

443
00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:21,680
>> I know.

444
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,580
And now he knows that I know.

445
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:25,460
>> Did you get a good look at him?

446
00:35:26,361 --> 00:35:27,780
Get some back up.

447
00:35:29,153 --> 00:35:30,455
>> It was him.

448
00:35:30,455 --> 00:35:31,450
>> You're sure?

449
00:35:31,450 --> 00:35:32,910
>> Positive.

450
00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:33,743
>> Alright, when you're ready,

451
00:35:33,743 --> 00:35:34,940
we'll radio in your description.

452
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:36,260
>> Get me a canine unit.

453
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:37,303
>> That'll take time.

454
00:35:37,303 --> 00:35:38,470
>> Shit.

455
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:42,190
>> Agent Skinner: Hey, you need
to stay and start the track.

456
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:43,180
>> You stay.

457
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:57,280
Clever mother fucker.

458
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:03,740
>> Well, that was a waste of time.

459
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:06,230
>> Too late to contain him
but not a waste of time.

460
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:07,370
>> How do you figure?

461
00:36:07,370 --> 00:36:09,020
>> I know how he gets
out of the crime scenes.

462
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:10,708
>> How?

463
00:36:10,708 --> 00:36:12,924
>> Everyone says he
looks overdressed right?

464
00:36:12,924 --> 00:36:15,785
That's because he puts the
bloody clothing on first

465
00:36:15,785 --> 00:36:18,196
and then clean clothing on over it.

466
00:36:18,196 --> 00:36:19,604
>> Makes sense.

467
00:36:19,604 --> 00:36:22,076
>> Then he has to burn everything, right?

468
00:36:22,076 --> 00:36:23,500
Where's he doing that?

469
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:24,750
>> I don't know.

470
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:25,750
>> You think if you spot him,

471
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:27,063
he'll skip on killing someone tonight?

472
00:36:27,063 --> 00:36:30,450
>> Just the opposite, it's angered him,

473
00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:32,100
he's even more enraged now.

474
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:34,980
The next victim will be
the one to face his wrath.

475
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:36,514
I'm sick about it.

476
00:36:36,514 --> 00:36:37,560
>> It's not your fault.

477
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,375
You're the closest anyone's
ever gotten to him.

478
00:36:39,375 --> 00:36:42,042
(phone ringing)

479
00:36:43,236 --> 00:36:46,110
>> Give me a minute,
guys, I need to take this.

480
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:47,353
Hey.

481
00:36:47,353 --> 00:36:49,145
No, I'm glad you called.

482
00:36:49,145 --> 00:36:52,025
Look, are you gonna be
around later tonight?

483
00:36:52,025 --> 00:36:54,330
Cool.

484
00:36:54,330 --> 00:36:56,441
I'll give you a call
when I get home, okay?

485
00:36:56,441 --> 00:36:57,274
Bye.

486
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,620
>> Hurry up, dispatcher
just put out the call.

487
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:02,720
>> What did I tell you?

488
00:38:00,410 --> 00:38:01,243
Hey.

489
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:03,590
>> Dave: You home?

490
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:04,423
>> Yeah.

491
00:38:04,423 --> 00:38:05,615
Can you come by?

492
00:38:05,615 --> 00:38:08,879
>> Dave: I'll call you when
I'm outside the garage.

493
00:38:08,879 --> 00:38:11,000
>> Alright, I'm just
gonna jump in the shower.

494
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,120
So I'll see you soon?

495
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,080
>> Dave: Okay, bye.

496
00:38:48,370 --> 00:38:49,203
>> Drink?

497
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:51,473
>> Sure.

498
00:39:28,785 --> 00:39:30,292
It's getting worse, isn't it?

499
00:39:30,292 --> 00:39:33,200
>> Yeah, worst one yet.

500
00:39:34,430 --> 00:39:36,710
When I spotted him, he knew that I knew

501
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:38,680
and it made him really angry.

502
00:39:39,697 --> 00:39:43,470
I'm telling you, I can feel it.

503
00:39:43,470 --> 00:39:44,900
>> It's not your fault.

504
00:39:46,506 --> 00:39:48,890
You can't blame yourself.

505
00:39:48,890 --> 00:39:50,430
>> Sure I can.

506
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:51,510
It doesn't help but I...

507
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:53,100
>> You found the guy.

508
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:55,337
Talk about a needle in a haystack.

509
00:39:55,337 --> 00:39:57,180
You should be proud of yourself.

510
00:40:03,089 --> 00:40:04,640
You need this more than me.

511
00:40:06,188 --> 00:40:08,476
>> Trying to get my drunk?

512
00:40:08,476 --> 00:40:10,612
>> Maybe.

513
00:40:10,612 --> 00:40:11,750
>> Good plan.

514
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:17,340
I like that plan.

515
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:35,960
Let me off here.

516
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:36,793
I'm getting something

517
00:40:36,793 --> 00:40:37,920
but I can't think in this car.

518
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,240
>> Just sit tight, Taylor,

519
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:40,503
you'll find the guy.

520
00:40:40,503 --> 00:40:42,310
>> I said let me off.

521
00:40:45,201 --> 00:40:46,570
>> Agent Green: Call us when
you want us to pick you up.

522
00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:47,403
>> I will.

523
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:13,870
Unit 400, put this out.

524
00:41:14,923 --> 00:41:17,673
>> Dispatcher: Location unit 400.

525
00:41:19,763 --> 00:41:24,242
Location unit 400.

526
00:41:24,242 --> 00:41:25,825
Location, unit 400.

527
00:41:27,437 --> 00:41:28,270
>> Unknown.

528
00:41:29,645 --> 00:41:30,910
>> Officer: Last location for unit 400

529
00:41:30,910 --> 00:41:32,686
was Wilson and Vermont.

530
00:41:32,686 --> 00:41:35,519
(heavy breathing)

531
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:43,590
>> Stop running, you fucking coward.

532
00:41:47,909 --> 00:41:51,060
(bullets firing)

533
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:52,330
>> Unit 400.

534
00:41:52,330 --> 00:41:53,440
>> Dispatcher: Unit 400, go ahead.

535
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:57,014
>> Shots fired, all units use caution.

536
00:41:57,014 --> 00:41:58,246
>> Shit.

537
00:41:58,246 --> 00:42:00,895
(sirens wailing)

538
00:42:00,895 --> 00:42:03,645
(bullets firing)

539
00:42:05,121 --> 00:42:06,204
>> You fucker!

540
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:11,270
I'm on to you, I'm fucking on to you.

541
00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:14,020
(sirens wailing)

542
00:42:21,350 --> 00:42:22,340
>> Are you okay?

543
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:23,559
>> Yeah, but that fucker,

544
00:42:23,559 --> 00:42:25,830
he lured me away so he could nail me.

545
00:42:25,830 --> 00:42:26,890
>> Well, where are your buddies?

546
00:42:26,890 --> 00:42:28,419
>> I foolishly went off on my own.

547
00:42:28,419 --> 00:42:30,060
>> Which way did he go?

548
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:31,960
>> That way, about five minutes ago.

549
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:32,900
>> You want a canine?

550
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:35,707
>> No, he's gone, it's no use.

551
00:42:35,707 --> 00:42:38,040
>> Hey, I'm glad you're okay.

552
00:42:39,768 --> 00:42:41,669
Try and stay out of trouble.

553
00:42:41,669 --> 00:42:44,419
(sirens wailing)

554
00:42:52,357 --> 00:42:53,381
>> Why didn't you tell us

555
00:42:53,381 --> 00:42:54,576
where the hell you were going?

556
00:42:54,576 --> 00:42:55,830
>> Because I didn't know.

557
00:42:55,830 --> 00:42:58,920
I don't know this city,
I just use my instincts.

558
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:01,550
>> Yeah, your instincts
almost got you killed.

559
00:43:01,550 --> 00:43:03,180
>> No, they almost got our man.

560
00:43:05,290 --> 00:43:08,037
Expect another grisly
one today, gentlemen.

561
00:43:08,037 --> 00:43:10,787
(sirens wailing)

562
00:43:15,227 --> 00:43:16,640
>> Upstairs, first door to your left.

563
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:23,980
It's bad in there.

564
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:25,810
Last officer they sent threw up.

565
00:43:26,876 --> 00:43:28,326
Sergeant sent me to takeover.

566
00:43:29,930 --> 00:43:31,210
>> Robbie: It's always bad.

567
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:33,460
>> This time there's two.

568
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:35,610
>> Jesus.

569
00:43:35,610 --> 00:43:37,930
>> Has he ever done this before?

570
00:43:37,930 --> 00:43:38,763
>> No.

571
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:42,210
>> You're close to getting him, Robbie.

572
00:43:42,210 --> 00:43:44,176
>> I'm pissing him off.

573
00:43:44,176 --> 00:43:46,929
>> How does he do it, two against one?

574
00:43:46,929 --> 00:43:48,859
>> He drugs them.

575
00:43:48,859 --> 00:43:52,310
He feeds them and then puts
tranquilizers in their food.

576
00:43:52,310 --> 00:43:54,673
The coroner finds it in
their blood every time.

577
00:43:54,673 --> 00:43:55,960
>> Shit.

578
00:43:59,111 --> 00:44:01,080
>> I better head upstairs.

579
00:44:17,244 --> 00:44:18,320
Hey.

580
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:19,153
>> Hey.

581
00:44:25,448 --> 00:44:27,100
You okay?

582
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:29,400
>> Better now after some scotch.

583
00:44:30,318 --> 00:44:32,259
>> Can I be honest?

584
00:44:32,259 --> 00:44:34,240
>> Robbie: You hate scotch?

585
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:37,960
>> Hate's a strong word, I prefer beer.

586
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:39,060
>> Robbie: Now I know.

587
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:43,110
>> Fuck, you're hot.

588
00:44:44,209 --> 00:44:45,959
>> You're the hot one.

589
00:44:45,959 --> 00:44:47,420
Every time I look at you,

590
00:44:47,420 --> 00:44:49,009
I just want to rip your clothes off.

591
00:44:49,009 --> 00:44:50,567
>> And that's a bad thing?

592
00:44:50,567 --> 00:44:51,870
>> Hell no.

593
00:46:24,650 --> 00:46:26,450
Ever think about living in Virginia?

594
00:46:27,330 --> 00:46:29,230
I don't think I want you getting away.

595
00:46:39,150 --> 00:46:40,480
>> What?

596
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:42,110
>> You're wrong.

597
00:46:42,110 --> 00:46:43,690
>> Stop doing that.

598
00:46:44,526 --> 00:46:46,100
>> I can tell by your expression.

599
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:46,933
>> Tel what?

600
00:46:46,933 --> 00:46:50,160
>> You think I do this all the time,

601
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:51,230
whenever I'm on assignment.

602
00:46:51,230 --> 00:46:52,063
>> Don't you?

603
00:46:52,966 --> 00:46:54,830
>> I'm human.

604
00:46:54,830 --> 00:46:57,259
I don't screw around much.

605
00:46:57,259 --> 00:47:00,190
I'm either too busy or too tired.

606
00:47:02,388 --> 00:47:03,670
>> Once you're done with this case,

607
00:47:03,670 --> 00:47:05,134
you're going back home, right?

608
00:47:05,134 --> 00:47:07,857
And sent on the next case
and sent on the next case.

609
00:47:07,857 --> 00:47:08,690
>> And?

610
00:47:08,690 --> 00:47:09,523
>> And I'm just saying

611
00:47:09,523 --> 00:47:10,820
maybe I shouldn't get too close to you.

612
00:47:11,779 --> 00:47:12,890
If I do,

613
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:21,270
it's gonna suck when you have to leave.

614
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:31,920
>> Let's just enjoy the time that we have,

615
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:35,680
anything can happen.

616
00:47:37,970 --> 00:47:40,040
And it sounds as if a new location

617
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:42,190
might be an option for both of us.

618
00:47:44,450 --> 00:47:47,640
>> You're right, I'm
sorry, I'm new at this.

619
00:47:57,120 --> 00:47:58,060
>> And I get that.

620
00:48:18,381 --> 00:48:20,800
>> We're not letting you wander
around on your own again.

621
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:22,264
>> You just don't want me to make the call

622
00:48:22,264 --> 00:48:24,243
or you'd lose the glory.

623
00:48:24,243 --> 00:48:26,810
>> No, wise ass, we just
don't want to have to arrange

624
00:48:26,810 --> 00:48:29,440
for your body to be
shipped back to Quantico.

625
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:30,810
>> Nice.

626
00:48:30,810 --> 00:48:32,350
How am I supposed to find this asshole

627
00:48:32,350 --> 00:48:34,806
when I'm stuck in the back of a car, huh?

628
00:48:34,806 --> 00:48:35,660
>> I get what you're saying

629
00:48:35,660 --> 00:48:36,880
but we'll have to go with you.

630
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:39,000
>> Three men in black suits,

631
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,993
you call that inconspicuous?

632
00:48:40,993 --> 00:48:42,891
>> What's the difference?

633
00:48:42,891 --> 00:48:44,750
>> Yeah, he already knows
we're looking for him.

634
00:48:44,750 --> 00:48:45,760
>> My luck, I'll be sniped

635
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:47,820
as we crawl around the
same stupid streets.

636
00:48:47,820 --> 00:48:48,870
>> You're not going out alone.

637
00:48:48,870 --> 00:48:50,020
>> What are you, my mother?

638
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:53,222
>> No, the senior agent on this assignment

639
00:48:53,222 --> 00:48:54,720
and you answer to me.

640
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:59,558
>> You both cringed when I
was sent out here, didn't you?

641
00:48:59,558 --> 00:49:02,177
You probably shivered in revulsion.

642
00:49:02,177 --> 00:49:04,580
I'm not an idiot

643
00:49:04,580 --> 00:49:06,520
but I can find this lunatic

644
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:09,100
so let me before he kills someone else.

645
00:49:12,290 --> 00:49:13,840
I don't need a babysitter.

646
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:14,990
>> We're going with you.

647
00:49:17,979 --> 00:49:19,685
Just cruise around,

648
00:49:19,685 --> 00:49:21,660
I'll call you when our freak

649
00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:23,330
gets tired of being a jerk.

650
00:49:26,950 --> 00:49:28,800
>> One of us might look like a businessman

651
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:29,820
but two of us?

652
00:49:29,820 --> 00:49:31,830
Agents, instantly.

653
00:49:31,830 --> 00:49:34,090
>> We already had this conversation Taylor

654
00:49:34,090 --> 00:49:36,860
and we determined that he
already knows who you are

655
00:49:36,860 --> 00:49:38,000
so which way?

656
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,697
>> I'm beginning to hate this job.

657
00:49:39,697 --> 00:49:42,340
>> Stop your whining and find the bastard.

658
00:50:03,218 --> 00:50:04,682
I need coffee.

659
00:50:04,682 --> 00:50:06,130
>> So go.

660
00:50:06,130 --> 00:50:08,810
>> Come and I'll buy.

661
00:50:08,810 --> 00:50:09,860
>> I'll wait out here.

662
00:50:10,762 --> 00:50:11,595
>> No you won't.

663
00:50:11,595 --> 00:50:13,060
>> Just go get your coffee.

664
00:50:13,060 --> 00:50:16,411
>> Look, I come back out
here and you're gone,

665
00:50:16,411 --> 00:50:18,270
there's gonna be hell to pay.

666
00:50:19,812 --> 00:50:21,470
Do I make myself clear?

667
00:50:21,470 --> 00:50:22,510
>> Perfectly

668
00:50:22,510 --> 00:50:26,210
and if I do see the guy
and don't go after him,

669
00:50:26,210 --> 00:50:28,100
will there be hell to pay then too?

670
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,552
>> Are we gonna look down
every stupid alley in the area?

671
00:50:47,552 --> 00:50:49,048
>> Maybe.

672
00:50:49,048 --> 00:50:51,148
You don't have to go if you don't want to.

673
00:50:53,528 --> 00:50:55,430
>> I have to go pee now, too much coffee.

674
00:50:55,430 --> 00:50:57,100
>> Fine go.

675
00:50:57,100 --> 00:50:58,410
>> Stay here.

676
00:51:13,270 --> 00:51:15,770
(tense music)

677
00:52:21,390 --> 00:52:24,730
Oh, what are you doing, Taylor?

678
00:52:24,730 --> 00:52:27,110
>> You think this is
from the kitchen help?

679
00:52:27,110 --> 00:52:28,880
>> Shit, where the hell are we?

680
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:30,850
>> Somewhere in Korea Town.

681
00:52:30,850 --> 00:52:33,200
>> I'll go check for a
street sign or something.

682
00:52:35,035 --> 00:52:35,868
What the hell made you think

683
00:52:35,868 --> 00:52:37,770
to look here in the first place?

684
00:52:37,770 --> 00:52:40,490
>> The smell, for one
thing, but I had a feeling.

685
00:53:00,210 --> 00:53:01,043
Oh christ!

686
00:53:02,463 --> 00:53:03,486
>> Dispatcher: Seven Lincoln 60.

687
00:53:03,486 --> 00:53:05,151
>> Officer: Seven Lincoln 60.

688
00:53:05,151 --> 00:53:07,080
>> Dispatcher: Meet seven Lincoln 48

689
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:08,585
at the location on your screen.

690
00:53:08,585 --> 00:53:10,620
You copy seven Lincoln 48?

691
00:53:11,511 --> 00:53:12,530
>> Ten four.

692
00:53:18,716 --> 00:53:20,920
Why do you think we're
in front of an alley

693
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:22,390
instead of an apartment?

694
00:53:22,390 --> 00:53:23,640
>> I don't know.

695
00:53:32,750 --> 00:53:34,930
>> Hey, can one of you call homicide?

696
00:53:34,930 --> 00:53:36,000
>> What'd you find?

697
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,780
>> Intestines and a bloody shirt.

698
00:53:39,734 --> 00:53:40,784
>> I'll make the call.

699
00:53:46,874 --> 00:53:48,730
>> Are you okay?

700
00:53:48,730 --> 00:53:51,290
>> Yeah, but he's a sick fucker.

701
00:53:51,290 --> 00:53:53,645
>> How the hell did you
know to look in the alley?

702
00:53:53,645 --> 00:53:54,645
>> Intuition.

703
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:58,040
He's playing a lethal
game of chess with me.

704
00:54:01,230 --> 00:54:03,249
Do you have any evidence bags?

705
00:54:03,249 --> 00:54:05,310
>> Sure, I'll be right back.

706
00:54:10,570 --> 00:54:12,290
>> You like that guy, don't you?

707
00:54:14,550 --> 00:54:16,920
So what's up with you and that cop?

708
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:18,433
>> What do you mean?

709
00:54:18,433 --> 00:54:20,950
>> I didn't know you were gay.

710
00:54:20,950 --> 00:54:22,000
>> Now you do.

711
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,680
>> Boys in blue know that he's gay?

712
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:24,775
>> No.

713
00:54:24,775 --> 00:54:27,057
>> It's okay, I'm not gonna say anything.

714
00:54:27,057 --> 00:54:29,130
I'm cool with it.

715
00:54:29,130 --> 00:54:30,130
>> Robbie: Really?

716
00:54:30,130 --> 00:54:30,963
>> Yeah.

717
00:54:34,940 --> 00:54:37,190
>> I'm convinced this
creep finds them first,

718
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:39,393
probably when he's driving.

719
00:54:39,393 --> 00:54:41,170
>> You think he's driving around now?

720
00:54:42,725 --> 00:54:43,730
>> Maybe.

721
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:46,953
>> Hey!

722
00:54:55,583 --> 00:54:57,080
What are you doing, looking for his car?

723
00:54:57,080 --> 00:54:58,640
>> Yes, be quiet.

724
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:03,240
>> I'm gonna grab a quick coffee.

725
00:55:06,147 --> 00:55:08,647
(tense music)

726
00:55:21,607 --> 00:55:24,190
(shots firing)

727
00:55:28,529 --> 00:55:29,470
>> Oh fuck!

728
00:55:39,758 --> 00:55:41,310
Unit 400, alpha.

729
00:55:41,310 --> 00:55:42,810
>> Dispatcher: Unit 400 alpha, go ahead.

730
00:55:42,810 --> 00:55:44,528
>> Robbie: I've been shot.

731
00:55:44,528 --> 00:55:45,532
>> Shit!

732
00:55:45,532 --> 00:55:46,553
>> Robbie: I'm in a parking garage

733
00:55:46,553 --> 00:55:48,820
next to shadow reconciliation center.

734
00:55:48,820 --> 00:55:51,932
>> Seven Lincoln 48, code three.

735
00:55:51,932 --> 00:55:56,924
>> Dispatcher: Seven Lincoln
48, code three, ten four.

736
00:55:56,924 --> 00:55:59,174
(grunting)

737
00:56:04,012 --> 00:56:06,595
(upbeat music)

738
00:56:07,697 --> 00:56:10,447
(sirens wailing)

739
00:56:27,333 --> 00:56:28,520
>> Robbie!

740
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:29,944
>> Dave, get down.

741
00:56:29,944 --> 00:56:32,694
(sirens wailing)

742
00:56:41,008 --> 00:56:42,910
>> We need to get you to the hospital.

743
00:56:42,910 --> 00:56:45,040
>> It's not that bad I
can still feel my arm.

744
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:46,630
>> What happened?

745
00:56:46,630 --> 00:56:48,299
>> I was looking around at the cars.

746
00:56:48,299 --> 00:56:51,450
I found one that I think
would be a candidate

747
00:56:51,450 --> 00:56:53,110
and then I got hit.

748
00:56:54,855 --> 00:56:57,010
>> Agent Skinner's looking for you.

749
00:56:58,970 --> 00:57:00,440
>> Frank, you moron, get down.

750
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:12,750
>> Shit, Taylor, what happened?

751
00:57:12,750 --> 00:57:13,900
>> I got shot.

752
00:57:13,900 --> 00:57:15,660
If you would've fucking
turned your radio back up,

753
00:57:15,660 --> 00:57:16,921
you would've known.

754
00:57:16,921 --> 00:57:18,860
>> Do you know where the
suspect is shooting from?

755
00:57:18,860 --> 00:57:19,693
>> No.

756
00:57:22,090 --> 00:57:23,600
>> Agent Skinner: We need
to get you out of here.

757
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:25,430
>> My car's at the end of the road,

758
00:57:25,430 --> 00:57:27,930
I'll get him to the
hospital, it's close by.

759
00:57:27,930 --> 00:57:29,123
>> Good.

760
00:57:29,123 --> 00:57:31,610
You take the left, I'll take the right.

761
00:57:39,220 --> 00:57:40,053
Clear.

762
00:57:41,246 --> 00:57:42,079
>> Clear.

763
00:57:44,042 --> 00:57:46,465
(grunting)

764
00:57:46,465 --> 00:57:49,460
(sirens wailing)

765
00:57:49,460 --> 00:57:51,139
>> I want that car impounded

766
00:57:51,139 --> 00:57:53,027
and no one's allowed near
it until I get there.

767
00:57:53,027 --> 00:57:55,118
>> Don't worry about it,
I'll take care of it.

768
00:57:55,118 --> 00:57:56,334
>> Shit.

769
00:57:56,334 --> 00:57:57,400
>> What is it?

770
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:59,534
>> I stopped that car a few days ago.

771
00:57:59,534 --> 00:58:00,558
>> You did?

772
00:58:00,558 --> 00:58:02,840
>> Yeah, I'll look it up at the station.

773
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:04,163
>> Do you remember what he looked like?

774
00:58:04,163 --> 00:58:05,746
>> I don't remember.

775
00:58:21,740 --> 00:58:22,920
>> How's the patient?

776
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:23,753
>> Fine.

777
00:58:25,380 --> 00:58:26,280
>> We'll take it from here, Harris.

778
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:28,280
>> Its okay, I don't mind.

779
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:30,573
>> We're gonna take him back
to the apartment after this.

780
00:58:30,573 --> 00:58:32,670
Don't you have to stay on duty?

781
00:58:32,670 --> 00:58:34,370
>> I'll just hang out
till he's ready to go.

782
00:58:34,370 --> 00:58:36,400
>> They're gonna need you
at the next crime scene.

783
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:37,490
>> And there will be one.

784
00:58:37,490 --> 00:58:40,820
>> Okay, I get it, just
give me a minute, okay?

785
00:58:40,820 --> 00:58:41,653
>> Be careful, guys.

786
00:58:41,653 --> 00:58:43,050
>> Shut up and let the doctor finish.

787
00:58:43,050 --> 00:58:44,816
>> Thank you, I appreciate that.

788
00:58:44,816 --> 00:58:47,416
>> Dave's big enough to
squash you like a bug, Frank.

789
00:58:49,610 --> 00:58:54,610
>> Alright, there you go, good as new

790
00:58:54,782 --> 00:58:57,494
and make sure you keep
that wound clean, okay?

791
00:58:57,494 --> 00:58:58,640
>> Thanks, doc.

792
00:58:59,777 --> 00:59:01,334
>> You're all set.

793
00:59:01,334 --> 00:59:02,630
>> Thank you.

794
00:59:07,275 --> 00:59:08,725
>> You can't put that back on.

795
00:59:10,325 --> 00:59:12,410
>> I guess I'm just stuck
in this hospital gown

796
00:59:12,410 --> 00:59:13,290
till I get home.

797
00:59:13,290 --> 00:59:14,670
>> Well you should stay.

798
00:59:14,670 --> 00:59:16,920
>> Exactly, you need your rest.

799
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:18,650
>> We're hot on this asshole's trail.

800
00:59:18,650 --> 00:59:20,322
I just needed a change of clothes.

801
00:59:20,322 --> 00:59:23,910
>> After we drop you off,
you are taking the night off.

802
00:59:23,910 --> 00:59:25,430
Am I making myself clear?

803
00:59:25,430 --> 00:59:26,900
>> Why don't I just take him home

804
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:28,472
that way you guys can get back out there?

805
00:59:28,472 --> 00:59:30,270
>> Who put you in charge?

806
00:59:30,270 --> 00:59:32,290
>> Hey, I just thought it
would stop the argument, okay?

807
00:59:32,290 --> 00:59:35,050
>> Fine, let's go, come on.

808
00:59:39,567 --> 00:59:41,719
>> They hate you, don't they?

809
00:59:41,719 --> 00:59:43,481
>> It's just how they are.

810
00:59:43,481 --> 00:59:46,160
Never mind, just get me home,

811
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:47,670
I want you to take a look at that call

812
00:59:47,670 --> 00:59:48,620
and give me a name.

813
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:58,250
>> Here it is, Bob T. Stalker.

814
00:59:58,250 --> 00:59:59,170
>> You're joking, right?

815
00:59:59,170 --> 01:00:01,797
That's not his real name.

816
01:00:01,797 --> 01:00:03,540
Where's the address?

817
01:00:04,942 --> 01:00:07,930
>> 100 Ramrod Street, Boise, Idaho.

818
01:00:07,930 --> 01:00:08,820
>> Useless crap.

819
01:00:08,820 --> 01:00:09,740
>> All made up?

820
01:00:09,740 --> 01:00:11,130
>> Ramrod Street, come on.

821
01:00:11,130 --> 01:00:12,830
>> What about the car?

822
01:00:12,830 --> 01:00:14,210
There has to be something.

823
01:00:14,210 --> 01:00:15,043
>> It's a mess in there,

824
01:00:15,043 --> 01:00:17,436
they're never gonna find anything inside.

825
01:00:17,436 --> 01:00:20,014
Dead end after dead end.

826
01:00:20,014 --> 01:00:22,110
>> Well at least we have his car,

827
01:00:22,110 --> 01:00:23,140
he can't go too far.

828
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:33,593
>> Here.

829
01:00:33,593 --> 01:00:37,870
This'll make getting in and out
of my building a lot easier.

830
01:00:40,295 --> 01:00:41,128
>> Thanks.

831
01:00:44,980 --> 01:00:46,169
>> Dispatcher: Seven Lincoln 60.

832
01:00:46,169 --> 01:00:47,803
>> Officer: Seven Lincoln 60.

833
01:00:47,803 --> 01:00:49,900
>> Dispatcher: Meet seven Lincoln 48

834
01:00:49,900 --> 01:00:51,435
at the location on your screen.

835
01:00:51,435 --> 01:00:52,840
You copy, seven Lincoln 48?

836
01:00:56,110 --> 01:00:56,943
>> Ten four.

837
01:01:11,189 --> 01:01:12,239
You see where we are?

838
01:01:13,647 --> 01:01:14,870
>> No.

839
01:01:14,870 --> 01:01:17,610
>> We're right next to the
parking lot where you got shot.

840
01:01:17,610 --> 01:01:18,443
>> Figures.

841
01:01:20,290 --> 01:01:22,140
I bet he already murdered the victim

842
01:01:22,140 --> 01:01:23,860
before he shot at me

843
01:01:23,860 --> 01:01:25,430
and then waited for all
the excitement to die down

844
01:01:25,430 --> 01:01:26,725
before he walked away.

845
01:01:26,725 --> 01:01:28,800
>> At least he can't drive.

846
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:29,800
>> He'll steal another car.

847
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:33,000
That won't stop him.

848
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:34,250
>> Sergeant Wilson's here.

849
01:01:42,390 --> 01:01:43,720
Hey, you okay?

850
01:01:49,936 --> 01:01:53,021
>> So now we're looking for
a torso with no contents.

851
01:01:53,021 --> 01:01:55,410
How the hell did he get
the rest of the body out

852
01:01:55,410 --> 01:01:56,740
without being seen?

853
01:01:56,740 --> 01:01:57,778
>> Fuck.

854
01:01:57,778 --> 01:01:59,421
>> What?

855
01:01:59,421 --> 01:02:01,290
>> Robbie: In the trunk.

856
01:02:01,290 --> 01:02:02,200
>> The torso?

857
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:03,495
>> Yeah.

858
01:02:03,495 --> 01:02:05,480
>> Well, how could he
know you'd find his car?

859
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:06,313
>> He didn't.

860
01:02:06,313 --> 01:02:08,820
I have no idea if he shot me

861
01:02:08,820 --> 01:02:13,160
to get me away from
finding it or to kill me.

862
01:02:13,160 --> 01:02:14,650
We gotta go to the crime lab.

863
01:02:14,650 --> 01:02:15,710
>> He's never done this before.

864
01:02:15,710 --> 01:02:18,725
>> You think I put a damper on his plan?

865
01:02:18,725 --> 01:02:23,725
My guess is he wanted to put
the torso in the alley again

866
01:02:24,060 --> 01:02:26,205
so we'd stumble onto it.

867
01:02:26,205 --> 01:02:29,710
But then I think I pissed
him off when I found his car.

868
01:02:29,710 --> 01:02:31,430
>> Yeah, I bet you're right.

869
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:35,600
>> I'll have my guys take me to the lab.

870
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:37,021
They just got here

871
01:02:37,021 --> 01:02:39,276
so they'll probably want to
take a look around first.

872
01:02:39,276 --> 01:02:41,885
I'll go get 'em.

873
01:02:41,885 --> 01:02:42,718
>> No problem.

874
01:02:57,909 --> 01:02:58,854
>> How's your arm?

875
01:02:58,854 --> 01:03:00,495
>> Fine.

876
01:03:00,495 --> 01:03:02,800
You guys should probably go
take a look around inside.

877
01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:04,900
I'm gonna hang out here if you don't mind.

878
01:03:06,145 --> 01:03:07,878
>> So what are we in for this time?

879
01:03:07,878 --> 01:03:09,710
>> Be prepared.

880
01:03:09,710 --> 01:03:10,890
He emptied the chest cavity

881
01:03:10,890 --> 01:03:12,635
and left the organs all over the place.

882
01:03:12,635 --> 01:03:14,171
>> Charming.

883
01:03:14,171 --> 01:03:16,500
>> But I think the torso
may be in that trunk

884
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:17,850
of the car I had impounded.

885
01:03:19,590 --> 01:03:20,423
>> Wonderful.

886
01:03:21,750 --> 01:03:23,260
We'll be back in a few minutes.

887
01:03:44,510 --> 01:03:45,343
>> The guys upstairs

888
01:03:45,343 --> 01:03:47,658
said the tow truck only
brought it up an hour ago.

889
01:03:47,658 --> 01:03:49,410
>> So nobody's been near it?

890
01:03:50,745 --> 01:03:51,620
>> Not yet.

891
01:03:52,744 --> 01:03:53,950
>> Looks clean.

892
01:03:55,322 --> 01:03:57,690
>> But I can smell it.

893
01:03:57,690 --> 01:03:59,440
>> Think the rest of him's in there?

894
01:04:01,164 --> 01:04:03,250
>> Yep, it's him.

895
01:04:04,918 --> 01:04:07,357
But we better get the lab
guys down here anyway.

896
01:04:07,357 --> 01:04:09,870
No use screwing with the evidence.

897
01:04:11,396 --> 01:04:12,770
>> I'll take care of it.

898
01:04:18,122 --> 01:04:20,060
>> I don't understand why
the hell it took 'em so long

899
01:04:20,060 --> 01:04:21,230
to bring you in.

900
01:04:21,230 --> 01:04:22,900
You should've been here ages ago.

901
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:24,170
>> You think?

902
01:04:24,170 --> 01:04:25,256
>> You're on to this bastard.

903
01:04:25,256 --> 01:04:26,650
I just can't help thinking

904
01:04:26,650 --> 01:04:28,520
that we wouldn't be
standing here right now

905
01:04:28,520 --> 01:04:29,736
if you'd been brought in earlier.

906
01:04:29,736 --> 01:04:32,786
>> Well, the deputy
director needed convincing.

907
01:04:32,786 --> 01:04:35,002
I offered to come in early.

908
01:04:35,002 --> 01:04:36,080
I tried.

909
01:05:08,281 --> 01:05:09,114
(dramatic music)

910
01:05:09,114 --> 01:05:09,947
>> Fuck!

911
01:05:13,807 --> 01:05:16,307
(phone dings)

912
01:05:29,053 --> 01:05:32,303
(soft classical music)

913
01:05:39,748 --> 01:05:42,665
(knocking on door)

914
01:05:51,750 --> 01:05:53,340
>> Hey sexy.

915
01:05:53,340 --> 01:05:56,010
Obviously everything worked
out with the garage clicker.

916
01:05:56,010 --> 01:05:56,843
>> No problem.

917
01:05:58,066 --> 01:05:58,899
>> Come in.

918
01:06:09,657 --> 01:06:10,580
(romantic music)

919
01:06:10,580 --> 01:06:12,680
>> Oh sorry, how's the shoulder?

920
01:06:12,680 --> 01:06:14,950
>> Not bad, the scotch helped.

921
01:06:17,310 --> 01:06:18,710
I'm just mad that he got me.

922
01:06:20,840 --> 01:06:23,270
>> Man, I almost had a heart attack

923
01:06:23,270 --> 01:06:25,490
when I found out you had been shot.

924
01:06:25,490 --> 01:06:27,500
>> At least the bullet just grazed my arm.

925
01:06:27,500 --> 01:06:28,950
The lab guys removed it from the car.

926
01:06:28,950 --> 01:06:29,783
>> Hey,

927
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:37,080
I'm glad you're okay.

928
01:06:38,870 --> 01:06:41,497
Do you think you should
still be out there?

929
01:06:41,497 --> 01:06:43,660
I mean, he knows who you are.

930
01:06:43,660 --> 01:06:44,493
>> I have to.

931
01:06:44,493 --> 01:06:47,120
I'm the only one that can ID him.

932
01:06:47,120 --> 01:06:48,921
>> But he's a serial killer.

933
01:06:48,921 --> 01:06:50,756
He has it in for you

934
01:06:50,756 --> 01:06:54,000
and you guys never wear vests.

935
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,270
>> You're right, maybe I should.

936
01:06:57,241 --> 01:06:58,880
I mean, we're usually
investigating the scene

937
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:00,441
after the crime's done.

938
01:07:00,441 --> 01:07:02,511
I've never actually worn one.

939
01:07:02,511 --> 01:07:07,511
>> Get one, please, just for now.

940
01:07:08,655 --> 01:07:11,620
>> Alright, I will.

941
01:07:13,135 --> 01:07:14,130
Are you hungry?

942
01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:17,333
>> I am.

943
01:09:18,737 --> 01:09:20,340
>> Frank knows about us.

944
01:09:20,340 --> 01:09:21,680
>> Frank?

945
01:09:21,680 --> 01:09:22,930
>> Robbie: Agent Skinner.

946
01:09:23,857 --> 01:09:25,640
>> Is that why he and the other guy

947
01:09:25,640 --> 01:09:27,759
were giving me such a
hard time at the hospital?

948
01:09:27,759 --> 01:09:28,930
>> Probably.

949
01:09:30,883 --> 01:09:33,009
>> Do you even care that he knows.

950
01:09:33,009 --> 01:09:34,200
>> Not anymore.

951
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:36,470
Do you?

952
01:09:36,470 --> 01:09:38,770
>> No one at the police
station knows I'm gay.

953
01:09:38,770 --> 01:09:40,970
>> I understand but just so you know

954
01:09:40,970 --> 01:09:43,090
I don't go around telling
people that I'm gay.

955
01:09:43,090 --> 01:09:44,840
>> But you wouldn't deny it.

956
01:09:44,840 --> 01:09:45,673
>> True.

957
01:09:47,913 --> 01:09:49,905
>> I wonder what my squad
would think if they knew

958
01:09:49,905 --> 01:09:51,700
or my sergeant.

959
01:09:52,551 --> 01:09:55,665
>> Agent Skinner won't
say a word to your guys.

960
01:09:55,665 --> 01:09:57,520
Don't worry.

961
01:09:57,520 --> 01:09:58,887
>> Let me help.

962
01:09:58,887 --> 01:09:59,920
>> Okay.

963
01:10:09,639 --> 01:10:10,472
Fuck!

964
01:10:10,472 --> 01:10:11,305
>> Ah, sorry.

965
01:10:11,305 --> 01:10:13,860
I'm trying to be careful.

966
01:10:15,624 --> 01:10:16,840
It looks pretty raw.

967
01:10:19,286 --> 01:10:21,690
>> It should calm down by tomorrow.

968
01:10:23,187 --> 01:10:26,134
I could kill that bastard.

969
01:10:26,134 --> 01:10:29,520
>> Dave: Yeah, me too.

970
01:10:39,045 --> 01:10:39,878
Okay.

971
01:11:00,360 --> 01:11:01,610
>> Hi there, vest please.

972
01:11:02,550 --> 01:11:03,383
Thanks.

973
01:11:05,030 --> 01:11:05,930
Director's orders.

974
01:11:12,431 --> 01:11:13,710
>> You got to sign for it.

975
01:11:13,710 --> 01:11:14,543
>> Taylor.

976
01:11:21,583 --> 01:11:22,666
There you go.

977
01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:35,690
(grunting)

978
01:11:37,510 --> 01:11:39,093
You're such a mess.

979
01:11:41,960 --> 01:11:44,555
>> The jacket barely covers the thing.

980
01:11:44,555 --> 01:11:46,380
>> Shut up and let's go.

981
01:11:55,544 --> 01:11:57,070
>> I checked on the name Bob T. Stalker,

982
01:11:57,070 --> 01:11:58,370
no records were found.

983
01:11:58,370 --> 01:12:01,230
>> Seriously, why'd you bother?

984
01:12:01,230 --> 01:12:02,500
>> Well, we can't find the original owner

985
01:12:02,500 --> 01:12:04,580
on the sale of the vehicle.

986
01:12:04,580 --> 01:12:07,275
>> He's good, he's really good.

987
01:12:07,275 --> 01:12:10,120
>> Got plenty of DNA samples though,

988
01:12:10,120 --> 01:12:11,430
not from any of his victims.

989
01:12:11,430 --> 01:12:12,510
>> Yeah, they're so buried

990
01:12:12,510 --> 01:12:13,600
they can match anyone.

991
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:15,100
>> Who'd they match?

992
01:12:15,100 --> 01:12:16,148
>> No one.

993
01:12:16,148 --> 01:12:17,484
>> Unbelievable.

994
01:12:17,484 --> 01:12:21,300
>> Listen, you don't go out alone anymore.

995
01:12:21,300 --> 01:12:23,020
And from now on, if I
go to get some coffee,

996
01:12:23,020 --> 01:12:24,400
you're coming in with me.

997
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:25,233
Got that?

998
01:12:25,233 --> 01:12:26,866
>> Sure and the next time,

999
01:12:26,866 --> 01:12:29,300
make sure the volume on
your radio's turned up.

1000
01:12:31,770 --> 01:12:32,603
>> Deal.

1001
01:12:36,660 --> 01:12:37,950
>> I should just ride with Dave.

1002
01:12:37,950 --> 01:12:39,400
>> The guy you're sleeping with?

1003
01:12:39,400 --> 01:12:41,530
>> Yeah, at least I can trust him.

1004
01:12:41,530 --> 01:12:43,020
>> What's that supposed to mean?

1005
01:12:43,020 --> 01:12:44,460
>> Nothing.

1006
01:12:44,460 --> 01:12:47,370
>> Go ahead, ride with
him, we don't give a shit.

1007
01:12:47,370 --> 01:12:49,720
>> No, you can't ride with him.

1008
01:12:51,412 --> 01:12:52,518
>> What?

1009
01:12:52,518 --> 01:12:55,820
>> I just can't believe
big black guy is gay.

1010
01:12:55,820 --> 01:12:57,106
>> Why?

1011
01:12:57,106 --> 01:13:00,363
You think all gay guys are
delicate little flowers like you?

1012
01:13:00,363 --> 01:13:02,070
Then what?

1013
01:13:02,070 --> 01:13:04,396
>> He just looks more like
a football player than a--

1014
01:13:04,396 --> 01:13:05,310
>> Cop.

1015
01:13:05,310 --> 01:13:07,020
>> That wasn't what he was gonna say.

1016
01:13:07,020 --> 01:13:08,022
>> I know what he was gonna say

1017
01:13:08,022 --> 01:13:09,857
and I'm glad he didn't.

1018
01:13:09,857 --> 01:13:11,520
>> What kind of car is
our man driving now?

1019
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:13,600
>> A stolen one.

1020
01:13:18,210 --> 01:13:19,140
>> Hey bro.

1021
01:13:19,140 --> 01:13:20,865
>> Hey Ken, you good?

1022
01:13:20,865 --> 01:13:22,825
>> I'm good, man.

1023
01:13:22,825 --> 01:13:26,300
Hey, did they patch that old agent up?

1024
01:13:26,300 --> 01:13:28,118
>> Oh, yeah, it was just a graze.

1025
01:13:28,118 --> 01:13:30,440
>> Hey Dave, why were you there?

1026
01:13:30,440 --> 01:13:32,450
I mean, don't they have their own guys

1027
01:13:32,450 --> 01:13:33,558
to handle that type of shit?

1028
01:13:33,558 --> 01:13:35,240
Why are they wasting our time?

1029
01:13:35,240 --> 01:13:36,908
>> I just offered.

1030
01:13:36,908 --> 01:13:38,742
I was at the scene with him.

1031
01:13:38,742 --> 01:13:39,659
>> Say what?

1032
01:13:40,530 --> 01:13:43,630
>> Yeah, I've seen him at every call.

1033
01:13:43,630 --> 01:13:45,100
It's like I'm working with the dude.

1034
01:13:45,100 --> 01:13:46,560
>> That's fucked up.

1035
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:48,990
Hey, you're not thinking
bout trading forces, are you?

1036
01:13:48,990 --> 01:13:51,540
>> Who, me, FBI agent?

1037
01:13:51,540 --> 01:13:52,886
>> Why not?

1038
01:13:52,886 --> 01:13:54,690
Come on, man, they need more brothers.

1039
01:13:54,690 --> 01:13:55,660
>> See ya, man.

1040
01:13:55,660 --> 01:13:56,860
>> Alright, take it easy.

1041
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:01,060
>> Stay back and let me concentrate.

1042
01:14:06,621 --> 01:14:07,891
>> Dispatcher: Unit 400.

1043
01:14:07,891 --> 01:14:09,420
>> Robbie: Unit 400.

1044
01:14:09,420 --> 01:14:11,791
>> Dispatcher: Unit 400,
switch to southwest frequency.

1045
01:14:11,791 --> 01:14:13,413
>> He's moved south.

1046
01:14:13,413 --> 01:14:15,000
>> Agent Skinner: That's not good.

1047
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:16,660
>> Walden Hills, not too far.

1048
01:14:24,550 --> 01:14:25,674
>> Fuck me.

1049
01:14:25,674 --> 01:14:27,740
>> I've never seen anything like it.

1050
01:14:31,228 --> 01:14:32,628
>> You think he's still here?

1051
01:14:34,270 --> 01:14:37,230
>> Yeah, I can feel him.

1052
01:14:43,229 --> 01:14:45,130
Where are you, you fucking psycho?

1053
01:15:04,424 --> 01:15:07,174
(dramatic music)

1054
01:15:11,700 --> 01:15:14,310
400 alpha, behind the building,

1055
01:15:14,310 --> 01:15:15,800
switch to FBI frequency.

1056
01:15:17,210 --> 01:15:19,270
>> Officer: Coming up, you find something?

1057
01:15:19,270 --> 01:15:21,330
>> Yeah, bring a couple of lab guys.

1058
01:15:28,582 --> 01:15:30,220
>> We just had a chat

1059
01:15:30,220 --> 01:15:31,910
with the assistant chief of your director.

1060
01:15:31,910 --> 01:15:33,114
>> Why?

1061
01:15:33,114 --> 01:15:34,300
>> Well, we requested that you be able

1062
01:15:34,300 --> 01:15:35,970
to respond to scenes if at all possible,

1063
01:15:35,970 --> 01:15:38,910
even if they aren't
under your jurisdiction.

1064
01:15:39,852 --> 01:15:41,020
>> So far you're the only one

1065
01:15:41,020 --> 01:15:42,650
who seems to have a stomach to handle it.

1066
01:15:42,650 --> 01:15:43,650
>> See we're all a little concerned

1067
01:15:43,650 --> 01:15:45,274
about the crime scenes and how
they're affecting everybody

1068
01:15:45,274 --> 01:15:50,274
but you seem to be
handling it professionally.

1069
01:15:50,360 --> 01:15:51,240
>> Thanks sir.

1070
01:15:52,610 --> 01:15:54,230
I assumed you talked to my sergeant.

1071
01:15:54,230 --> 01:15:57,380
>> We have and he's letting our
head dispatcher know as well

1072
01:15:57,380 --> 01:16:00,267
so he'll be dispatching you as a priority

1073
01:16:00,267 --> 01:16:03,980
unless of course you're
on something else major.

1074
01:16:03,980 --> 01:16:04,813
>> Okay.

1075
01:16:06,233 --> 01:16:07,525
>> This is good news.

1076
01:16:07,525 --> 01:16:12,525
>> Indeed, thanks guys,
I'll see you out there.

1077
01:16:13,967 --> 01:16:16,550
(upbeat music)

1078
01:16:24,010 --> 01:16:26,550
>> Sergeant: Harris, I
need to speak to you.

1079
01:16:26,550 --> 01:16:28,070
>> It's fine, sarge.

1080
01:16:28,070 --> 01:16:29,408
>> You don't even know what I'm gonna say.

1081
01:16:29,408 --> 01:16:31,299
You might not think it's fine

1082
01:16:31,299 --> 01:16:32,132
after you hear--

1083
01:16:32,132 --> 01:16:33,986
>> I do know and I don't mind.

1084
01:16:33,986 --> 01:16:36,052
You want me to go on all
those homicide scenes, right?

1085
01:16:36,052 --> 01:16:38,657
>> How the hell did you know?

1086
01:16:38,657 --> 01:16:41,100
Only me, the captain
and the assistant chief

1087
01:16:41,100 --> 01:16:42,093
were supposed to know.

1088
01:16:42,093 --> 01:16:43,010
>> Someone mentioned it, that's all.

1089
01:16:43,010 --> 01:16:43,843
>> Who?

1090
01:16:45,729 --> 01:16:47,764
We didn't want the rest of
the team to know about this

1091
01:16:47,764 --> 01:16:50,733
or feel that they weren't capable.

1092
01:16:50,733 --> 01:16:53,630
>> I ran into that FBI agent, Skinner.

1093
01:16:55,332 --> 01:16:57,630
>> So he just tells you everything, huh?

1094
01:16:57,630 --> 01:17:01,580
>> No, sarge, we ran into each
other by accident yesterday.

1095
01:17:04,343 --> 01:17:05,941
>> So you're okay with it?

1096
01:17:05,941 --> 01:17:07,180
>> Fine.

1097
01:17:08,242 --> 01:17:09,230
>> Good man.

1098
01:17:09,230 --> 01:17:11,640
You know the captain appreciates it.

1099
01:17:13,690 --> 01:17:15,981
Too many of the other
guys were getting sick

1100
01:17:15,981 --> 01:17:18,860
or needing counseling.

1101
01:17:18,860 --> 01:17:20,300
>> It's no problem.

1102
01:17:20,300 --> 01:17:21,133
See you tomorrow.

1103
01:17:21,133 --> 01:17:21,966
>> Alright.

1104
01:17:28,138 --> 01:17:30,721
(upbeat music)

1105
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:36,310
>> Agent Skinner: Slow down, will you?

1106
01:17:36,310 --> 01:17:38,910
>> Robbie: You guys move
like snails, not my problem.

1107
01:17:38,910 --> 01:17:39,743
>> Agent Skinner: It
will be when you need us.

1108
01:17:39,743 --> 01:17:41,600
>> Shit, I left my phone in the car.

1109
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:42,440
Let me have the keys,

1110
01:17:42,440 --> 01:17:43,821
I'll go grab it

1111
01:17:43,821 --> 01:17:44,654
and then meet you guys back on the street.

1112
01:17:46,670 --> 01:17:48,070
Wait down there.

1113
01:17:50,100 --> 01:17:52,398
>> There he goes, off on his own again.

1114
01:17:52,398 --> 01:17:54,402
>> I don't like it.

1115
01:17:54,402 --> 01:17:57,319
(mysterious music)

1116
01:18:33,950 --> 01:18:35,000
>> Unit 400,

1117
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:36,923
suspect just tried to run me down.

1118
01:18:36,923 --> 01:18:40,560
I'm gonna try to intercept.

1119
01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:41,393
Give up.

1120
01:18:42,300 --> 01:18:43,700
You can't get away now.

1121
01:18:47,860 --> 01:18:48,750
Shit!

1122
01:18:56,378 --> 01:18:59,128
(sirens wailing)

1123
01:19:00,120 --> 01:19:01,220
>> Dave: Are you okay?

1124
01:19:03,433 --> 01:19:05,310
>> Robbie: No, I lost him.

1125
01:19:08,820 --> 01:19:10,500
>> Seven Lincoln 48.

1126
01:19:10,500 --> 01:19:12,370
>> Dispatcher: Seven Lincoln 48, go ahead.

1127
01:19:14,780 --> 01:19:15,700
>> Robbie, what is it?

1128
01:19:15,700 --> 01:19:17,845
>> I'm fine, we need to go after him.

1129
01:19:17,845 --> 01:19:19,820
>> Take a breath, man.

1130
01:19:19,820 --> 01:19:21,790
>> But I had him, I fucking had him.

1131
01:19:21,790 --> 01:19:23,750
>> How did you find him?

1132
01:19:23,750 --> 01:19:25,240
>> We were at the rec center.

1133
01:19:25,240 --> 01:19:26,270
I left my phone in the car.

1134
01:19:26,270 --> 01:19:27,850
He must've been looking
for his next victim.

1135
01:19:27,850 --> 01:19:30,260
I went in the parking garage

1136
01:19:30,260 --> 01:19:31,366
and he just came out of nowhere,

1137
01:19:31,366 --> 01:19:33,500
almost ran me down.

1138
01:19:36,477 --> 01:19:37,310
>> You okay?

1139
01:19:37,310 --> 01:19:38,200
>> Yeah.

1140
01:19:38,200 --> 01:19:39,280
>> Lost him again, huh?

1141
01:19:39,280 --> 01:19:40,219
>> No thanks to you.

1142
01:19:40,219 --> 01:19:41,800
>> You told us to park and walk

1143
01:19:41,800 --> 01:19:43,050
what the hell do you want from us?

1144
01:19:43,050 --> 01:19:45,253
>> We would've preferred
to just stayed in the car,

1145
01:19:45,253 --> 01:19:46,280
trust me.

1146
01:19:46,280 --> 01:19:47,298
>> Where do you hurt?

1147
01:19:47,298 --> 01:19:48,346
>> Robbie: My ribs.

1148
01:19:48,346 --> 01:19:49,720
>> Gotta go get some x-rays.

1149
01:19:49,720 --> 01:19:51,631
>> I'm not going back
to the fucking hospital.

1150
01:19:51,631 --> 01:19:54,450
>> Shut up and go get
checked out, that's an order.

1151
01:20:03,725 --> 01:20:06,223
>> This is becoming a habit, Agent Taylor.

1152
01:20:06,223 --> 01:20:08,895
(laughs)

1153
01:20:08,895 --> 01:20:10,061
>> Boy aren't you lucky,

1154
01:20:10,061 --> 01:20:13,005
only a cracked rib and a bruised pelvis.

1155
01:20:13,005 --> 01:20:14,816
>> You call that luck?

1156
01:20:14,816 --> 01:20:16,651
>> You could be dead.

1157
01:20:16,651 --> 01:20:17,690
>> Good point.

1158
01:20:18,552 --> 01:20:21,453
>> Hey, do you mind taking
me down to the impound later?

1159
01:20:21,453 --> 01:20:24,760
>> What you need to do
is go home and go to bed.

1160
01:20:24,760 --> 01:20:26,730
I don't want to see you back here.

1161
01:20:26,730 --> 01:20:28,520
>> I know, thanks doc.

1162
01:20:41,017 --> 01:20:42,690
>> Alright, here we go.

1163
01:20:44,053 --> 01:20:44,970
Easy, easy.

1164
01:20:46,590 --> 01:20:48,301
>> They have the car down there.

1165
01:20:48,301 --> 01:20:49,720
They want me to take a look inside.

1166
01:20:56,620 --> 01:20:57,760
Do you mind?

1167
01:20:57,760 --> 01:20:58,593
>> Of course not.

1168
01:21:07,948 --> 01:21:09,448
>> You're the best.

1169
01:21:20,033 --> 01:21:21,533
What have you got?

1170
01:21:22,539 --> 01:21:24,201
>> You okay?

1171
01:21:24,201 --> 01:21:25,938
>> You look like hell.

1172
01:21:25,938 --> 01:21:30,144
>> Thanks, I'm okay, what's up?

1173
01:21:30,144 --> 01:21:32,010
>> Take a look inside.

1174
01:21:34,010 --> 01:21:35,920
>> Robbie: Holy shit.

1175
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:37,230
>> Agent Skinner: Jackpot, huh?

1176
01:21:37,230 --> 01:21:39,570
>> The fucking jackpot.

1177
01:21:41,490 --> 01:21:44,737
This is gonna hit him
hard, it's his arsenal.

1178
01:21:44,737 --> 01:21:46,872
>> Gotta slow him down
a little bit, right?

1179
01:21:46,872 --> 01:21:49,510
>> I'm here to get this maniac.

1180
01:21:49,510 --> 01:21:50,730
>> We should just put
you out there on a hook

1181
01:21:50,730 --> 01:21:51,580
and wait for him.

1182
01:21:52,608 --> 01:21:54,120
>> Does this whole teasing thing

1183
01:21:54,120 --> 01:21:55,552
mean you're starting to like me?

1184
01:21:55,552 --> 01:21:57,120
>> Fuck no.

1185
01:21:57,120 --> 01:21:59,885
Besides, how many more
admirers can you handle?

1186
01:21:59,885 --> 01:22:00,830
>> Only one.

1187
01:22:08,236 --> 01:22:10,903
(phone ringing)

1188
01:22:22,235 --> 01:22:23,550
What is it Frank?

1189
01:22:24,920 --> 01:22:25,753
What?

1190
01:22:27,190 --> 01:22:29,140
Yeah, fine, just give me a few minutes.

1191
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:31,153
>> What's up?

1192
01:22:31,153 --> 01:22:32,964
>> Home invasion, he
just killed three people,

1193
01:22:32,964 --> 01:22:34,585
two adults and a kid.

1194
01:22:34,585 --> 01:22:35,918
>> Dave: Oh God.

1195
01:22:48,599 --> 01:22:50,862
>> Well at least it wasn't messy.

1196
01:22:50,862 --> 01:22:52,440
>> Just three dead people.

1197
01:22:53,358 --> 01:22:55,257
>> We sound jaded, don't we?

1198
01:22:55,257 --> 01:22:56,730
>> We are.

1199
01:22:58,497 --> 01:23:01,340
>> He strangled them
with a pair of nylons.

1200
01:23:01,340 --> 01:23:03,108
Must've found them in the bedroom.

1201
01:23:03,108 --> 01:23:05,390
>> Want to go looking for him again?

1202
01:23:05,390 --> 01:23:06,730
>> Maybe later.

1203
01:23:09,610 --> 01:23:11,660
>> Yeah I guess he's gotta sleep sometime.

1204
01:23:14,126 --> 01:23:17,220
>> Wait a second, we need to find a list

1205
01:23:17,220 --> 01:23:18,724
of all the cheap motels in the area

1206
01:23:18,724 --> 01:23:21,412
and then go check 'em
out as soon as we can.

1207
01:23:21,412 --> 01:23:24,380
My guess is he's on a week to week.

1208
01:23:26,011 --> 01:23:27,261
>> You're right.

1209
01:23:28,705 --> 01:23:30,896
Good thinking, Taylor.

1210
01:23:30,896 --> 01:23:32,660
I told Green to bring the car around.

1211
01:23:38,677 --> 01:23:41,250
>> FBI, we'd like to see a list

1212
01:23:41,250 --> 01:23:43,160
of today's registered guests.

1213
01:23:44,973 --> 01:23:47,473
(tense music)

1214
01:23:52,380 --> 01:23:53,220
Bingo.

1215
01:23:53,220 --> 01:23:54,853
>> We got 'em?

1216
01:23:54,853 --> 01:23:56,530
>> Mr. R. Stalker, number 27.

1217
01:23:56,530 --> 01:23:57,605
>> When did he check in?

1218
01:23:57,605 --> 01:23:58,990
>> About a week ago.

1219
01:23:58,990 --> 01:24:00,180
>> And paid how?

1220
01:24:00,180 --> 01:24:01,320
>> Cash, weekly.

1221
01:24:02,240 --> 01:24:03,856
>> We'd like a key to the room, please.

1222
01:24:03,856 --> 01:24:05,669
>> Afraid he checked out,

1223
01:24:05,669 --> 01:24:07,190
about an hour ago,

1224
01:24:07,190 --> 01:24:08,762
housekeeping's already cleaned the room.

1225
01:24:08,762 --> 01:24:09,595
>> Robbie: Damn it.

1226
01:24:09,595 --> 01:24:10,830
>> It's okay, we're getting close.

1227
01:24:25,180 --> 01:24:27,454
>> I heard they're
closing in on that sicko.

1228
01:24:27,454 --> 01:24:29,473
>> Won't be long now.

1229
01:24:29,473 --> 01:24:32,533
>> Too bad he wasn't
in his hotel room, huh?

1230
01:24:32,533 --> 01:24:34,680
Well at least they got his car, right?

1231
01:24:34,680 --> 01:24:35,513
>> It was stolen,

1232
01:24:35,513 --> 01:24:37,510
he'll probably just steal another.

1233
01:24:37,510 --> 01:24:38,546
>> And get out of town?

1234
01:24:38,546 --> 01:24:40,640
>> Let's hope not.

1235
01:24:40,640 --> 01:24:44,200
If he leaves town, who
knows when he'll get caught.

1236
01:24:47,245 --> 01:24:48,840
>> Have a good night, man.

1237
01:24:51,946 --> 01:24:53,450
>> Where to, Taylor?

1238
01:24:53,450 --> 01:24:54,421
>> I'm thinking.

1239
01:24:54,421 --> 01:24:56,610
>> If I were him, I'd be halfway to Idaho.

1240
01:24:58,700 --> 01:25:01,056
>> Well you're not and he isn't.

1241
01:25:01,056 --> 01:25:02,360
>> How do you know?

1242
01:25:02,360 --> 01:25:03,616
>> He's too damn mad,

1243
01:25:03,616 --> 01:25:06,330
he knows I've got his toys and souvenirs.

1244
01:25:07,960 --> 01:25:08,793
I don't think he's gonna leave

1245
01:25:08,793 --> 01:25:10,877
until he has the upper hand again.

1246
01:25:10,877 --> 01:25:13,781
>> Some loose teeth and
a few pieces of jewelry?-

1247
01:25:13,781 --> 01:25:18,080
>> Maybe, he certainly likes
playing with the victims things,

1248
01:25:18,080 --> 01:25:19,625
they remind him of the murders

1249
01:25:19,625 --> 01:25:22,790
when he's not at the crime scenes.

1250
01:25:22,790 --> 01:25:24,620
>> I think he'll leave.

1251
01:25:24,620 --> 01:25:26,260
It's too hot here.

1252
01:25:26,260 --> 01:25:28,629
>> That's just naive.

1253
01:25:28,629 --> 01:25:30,869
He wants revenge, trust me.

1254
01:25:30,869 --> 01:25:31,780
>> Where we going?

1255
01:25:31,780 --> 01:25:34,930
>> Fish hook, with me as the bait.

1256
01:25:39,781 --> 01:25:41,770
Forget it boys, he's not biting.

1257
01:25:41,770 --> 01:25:45,020
>> Agent Skinner: We'll be right there.

1258
01:25:55,957 --> 01:25:58,045
>> I thought for sure
he'd come looking for me.

1259
01:25:58,045 --> 01:26:00,690
>> Well it was worth the try.

1260
01:26:00,690 --> 01:26:01,523
>> It's almost six.

1261
01:26:01,523 --> 01:26:03,010
You boys want to stop for a bite

1262
01:26:03,010 --> 01:26:04,580
or head back to the apartment?

1263
01:26:04,580 --> 01:26:05,886
>> I'm starving.

1264
01:26:05,886 --> 01:26:07,010
>> What are you in the mood for?

1265
01:26:07,010 --> 01:26:08,340
>> Food, whatever.

1266
01:26:12,090 --> 01:26:13,771
>> I can't believe we
missed this asshole again.

1267
01:26:13,771 --> 01:26:15,728
>> Not by much.

1268
01:26:15,728 --> 01:26:17,650
>> Everything okay over here?

1269
01:26:17,650 --> 01:26:18,800
>> It's good, thank you.

1270
01:26:20,589 --> 01:26:23,533
>> We're doing the best we can

1271
01:26:23,533 --> 01:26:28,095
and your instincts were right.

1272
01:26:28,095 --> 01:26:29,972
>> Just like they were
about this restaurant.

1273
01:26:29,972 --> 01:26:30,940
Good choice, Taylor.

1274
01:26:30,940 --> 01:26:33,663
>> I just feel like my focus is off.

1275
01:26:33,663 --> 01:26:35,090
>> Maybe you cracked your head

1276
01:26:35,090 --> 01:26:36,009
when you cracked that rib.

1277
01:26:36,009 --> 01:26:37,240
>> This humor thing,

1278
01:26:37,240 --> 01:26:38,590
it's becoming a habit, huh?

1279
01:26:40,737 --> 01:26:43,049
I think I'm gonna go
take a look in the park.

1280
01:26:43,049 --> 01:26:45,040
You guys finish up here

1281
01:26:45,040 --> 01:26:46,990
and then come find me when you're done.

1282
01:26:47,970 --> 01:26:49,172
>> Waitress: Any room
for dessert you guys?

1283
01:26:49,172 --> 01:26:52,950
>> No, thank you but you can
leave these guys with the check.

1284
01:27:03,138 --> 01:27:05,805
(phone ringing)

1285
01:27:08,250 --> 01:27:09,083
>> How's it going?

1286
01:27:09,083 --> 01:27:10,780
>> Robbie: I'm over at Shadow Rec Center.

1287
01:27:10,780 --> 01:27:11,910
I think you should head over here.

1288
01:27:11,910 --> 01:27:12,790
>> I'm on my way.

1289
01:28:16,270 --> 01:28:17,880
>> Agent Taylor, what's your 20?

1290
01:28:21,660 --> 01:28:23,577
You know where he went?

1291
01:28:26,792 --> 01:28:28,542
>> Give up, it's over.

1292
01:28:30,106 --> 01:28:32,606
(tense music)

1293
01:28:39,390 --> 01:28:41,360
You can't get away this time, give up.

1294
01:28:43,032 --> 01:28:45,532
(tense music)

1295
01:28:58,570 --> 01:28:59,403
>> Shit!

1296
01:28:59,403 --> 01:29:00,810
>> Don't, not yet.

1297
01:29:00,810 --> 01:29:01,650
>> What's your plan?

1298
01:29:01,650 --> 01:29:03,050
>> Let me talk to him first.

1299
01:29:03,050 --> 01:29:03,900
>> Talk to him?

1300
01:29:03,900 --> 01:29:04,850
Are you kidding me?

1301
01:29:11,237 --> 01:29:13,950
>> Nobody gets too close.

1302
01:29:13,950 --> 01:29:15,418
>> That includes you, Robbie.

1303
01:29:15,418 --> 01:29:16,418
He's gonna kill him.

1304
01:29:21,120 --> 01:29:22,690
>> Seven Lincoln 48.

1305
01:29:22,690 --> 01:29:24,326
I have the suspect at gunpoint.

1306
01:29:24,326 --> 01:29:25,637
He has the victim,

1307
01:29:25,637 --> 01:29:27,950
he's holding him at knife point.

1308
01:29:27,950 --> 01:29:28,783
>> Dispatcher: Seven Lincoln 48.

1309
01:29:28,783 --> 01:29:30,330
One at gunpoint.

1310
01:29:30,330 --> 01:29:31,910
If you need to respond, code two.

1311
01:29:31,910 --> 01:29:34,202
>> Give it up, man, it's over.

1312
01:29:34,202 --> 01:29:38,860
Even if you claim him as
your own, you still lose.

1313
01:29:38,860 --> 01:29:42,120
>> Let me go and then I'll let him go.

1314
01:29:42,120 --> 01:29:43,075
>> Let you go?

1315
01:29:43,075 --> 01:29:45,670
You're joking, right?

1316
01:29:45,670 --> 01:29:48,218
Just put down the knife.

1317
01:29:48,218 --> 01:29:53,218
Look, we can sit down and
talk, write out your story,

1318
01:29:55,554 --> 01:29:58,350
you're already a star,

1319
01:29:58,350 --> 01:30:00,095
think of the publicity,

1320
01:30:00,095 --> 01:30:01,550
think of the book deals.

1321
01:30:06,265 --> 01:30:09,015
(bullets firing)

1322
01:30:14,137 --> 01:30:15,471
>> Officer: Seven Lincoln 44.

1323
01:30:15,471 --> 01:30:16,630
We have an injured victim.

1324
01:30:16,630 --> 01:30:17,678
Send in fire.

1325
01:30:17,678 --> 01:30:18,700
>> Dispatcher: Seven Lincoln 44,

1326
01:30:18,700 --> 01:30:19,533
as it apears,

1327
01:30:19,533 --> 01:30:20,616
sending fire.

1328
01:30:21,838 --> 01:30:22,838
>> Nice shot.

1329
01:30:24,296 --> 01:30:26,950
>> I've never had to
actually use my gun before.

1330
01:30:29,729 --> 01:30:32,090
>> Officer Harris, you did it,

1331
01:30:32,090 --> 01:30:33,340
you saved that boys life.

1332
01:30:43,689 --> 01:30:46,890
(slow music)

1333
01:30:46,890 --> 01:30:47,723
>> Nice work.

1334
01:30:47,723 --> 01:30:50,874
>> It wasn't me, it was Officer Harris,

1335
01:30:50,874 --> 01:30:52,980
congratulate him.

1336
01:30:52,980 --> 01:30:54,160
>> Really?

1337
01:30:54,160 --> 01:30:56,270
Shit, Taylor, what the hell good are you?

1338
01:30:56,270 --> 01:30:58,960
>> Just finding the
killer, Frank, that's all.

1339
01:30:58,960 --> 01:31:00,047
>> Nice work, Harris.

1340
01:31:00,047 --> 01:31:01,780
>> Thank you, sir.

1341
01:31:01,780 --> 01:31:02,613
>> You've been top notch

1342
01:31:02,613 --> 01:31:03,680
throughout this entire investigation.

1343
01:31:03,680 --> 01:31:07,290
I promise you it won't go unnoticed.

1344
01:31:09,280 --> 01:31:11,098
>> Which one of you shot him?

1345
01:31:11,098 --> 01:31:12,240
>> I did.

1346
01:31:13,524 --> 01:31:16,580
>> Right, give me your gun,

1347
01:31:16,580 --> 01:31:18,810
you're off now until an inquest.

1348
01:31:24,100 --> 01:31:27,164
You need to head over to
homicide and make a statement.

1349
01:31:27,164 --> 01:31:30,490
>> Don't worry, it's standard procedure.

1350
01:31:30,490 --> 01:31:31,750
You're a hero.

1351
01:31:32,871 --> 01:31:34,440
I'll go with you.

1352
01:31:43,510 --> 01:31:44,560
>> Let's get a coffee.

1353
01:31:48,606 --> 01:31:50,202
>> You know what this means?

1354
01:31:50,202 --> 01:31:52,655
>> You're going back to FBI headquarters.

1355
01:31:52,655 --> 01:31:56,460
>> Yeah, so why don't you go with me?

1356
01:31:58,095 --> 01:32:01,250
I can get you an interview
with one of the directors.

1357
01:32:01,250 --> 01:32:03,990
They'd love to have a guy like you.

1358
01:32:03,990 --> 01:32:05,770
>> Because they're short on black agents?

1359
01:32:05,770 --> 01:32:08,140
>> No, educated ones.

1360
01:32:08,140 --> 01:32:09,990
Smart fuckers like yourself.

1361
01:32:09,990 --> 01:32:12,570
You'd earn more, you'd be challenged,

1362
01:32:14,278 --> 01:32:15,510
you'll be with me.

1363
01:32:16,670 --> 01:32:18,300
>> You really want me there?

1364
01:32:19,151 --> 01:32:22,070
>> Yeah, I really do.

1365
01:32:24,131 --> 01:32:25,250
>> Let's do it.

1366
01:32:31,410 --> 01:32:35,640
>> Hey, Officer Harris, one more thing.

1367
01:32:54,786 --> 01:32:58,453
(radio static and mumbling)
