What are you
 guys talking about?

184
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:33,130
There's three of us.

185
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:34,170
It's perfect.

186
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:34,990
Three?

187
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:35,930
Yes.

188
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:38,270
Everything in magic is threes.

189
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:41,930
You end your votives
 with 3 times 3 times 3.

190
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:45,540
There's the holy trinity,
 the three wise men.

191
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:48,850
Three's company.

192
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:51,400
- Rose.
 - I'm sorry.

193
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:54,190
The whole idea is dumb.

194
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:55,460
No, this is great.

195
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,950
This is going to be
 great, because we're

196
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:59,410
going to videotape the ritual.

197
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:00,750
I can use this.

198
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,320
Are you serious?

199
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,590
I'm serious as a
 frickin' heart attack.

200
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:07,070
All right.

201
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:09,380
Can you at least let
 me get some pants on?

202
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:11,070
No, you look terrific.

203
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:13,560
Stevie, is this something bad?

204
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:19,310
Define bad.

205
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:22,520
Human sacrifice, the exorcist.

206
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,950
We're just going to
 read from this book.

207
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:26,030
I got it from a friend of mine.

208
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:28,970
He does antiquing up
 in Covington County.

209
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:30,140
What is that?

210
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:33,230
It's a book.

211
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:34,840
It's a book of spells.

212
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:56,280
We're going to have to
 mic this from the camera.

213
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,900
Damn it.

214
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:00,620
You're not going to dress up
 like that witch again, are you?

215
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:02,020
Shh.
 Girl at work here.

216
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:05,400
OK.

217
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:23,130
Let me guess.

218
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,670
Those aren't aromatherapy
 therapy candles.

219
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,670
Pretend I don't know
 anything about witchcraft.

220
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:38,340
What's the white candle for?

221
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:40,560
This is our travel candle.

222
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,320
This is what we focus
 on during the ritual,

223
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,170
right into the flame.

224
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:56,490
And the black one?

225
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:59,340
This is for protection.

226
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:01,610
Protection from what, Stevie?

227
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:04,450
You never know.

228
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:10,970
Evil spirits, demons, trolls.
 - OK.

229
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,460
You know what?
 Rose's right.

230
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:13,240
Let's just forget this.

231
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,970
Annie, this is just a ritual.

232
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:18,030
It's just like communion.

233
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:21,200
We light the candles, and
 we just go with the flow.

234
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,060
Nothing's going to happen.
 - Yeah?

235
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:26,030
Then why is that
 candle behind you?

236
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:28,260
It protects the whole
 god damn room, OK?

237
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:29,950
Can we just get on with this?

238
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,970
Um, we're not going to have
 to cut our palms or anything,

239
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:46,540
are we?

240
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:49,860
Annie, they, don't
 really do that, OK?

241
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:52,570
Our link is the fire.

242
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,950
And then what?

243
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:01,400
Then I read, and you
 help me concentrate.

244
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:16,920
I call upon forces greater
 than mine, the mother of Earth

245
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:19,350
and mistress of time.

246
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:24,010
Spirits, guide me fast and true.

247
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:27,850
Bid thy task, I ask of you.

248
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:31,870
Give unto thee thy
 demons' fire, and grant us

249
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:34,110
all our heart's desire.

250
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:40,530
What just happened
 to the lights?

251
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:41,650
I don't know.

252
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:43,740
Maybe the beach line's down.

253
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:45,550
Damn it.

254
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:46,440
The camera's on battery.

255
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,330
It's a low light, so
 don't worry about it.

256
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:49,070
Everything's OK.

257
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:51,520
This is actually perfect.

258
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,050
Stevie--

259
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:55,770
Annie, look into the fire.

260
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:58,380
I need you guys to
 help me on this part.

261
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:11,400
I call upon thy sacred name.

262
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:16,270
I call upon thy sacred name.

263
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:19,750
I call upon thy sacred name.

264
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:21,410
Repeat it to the fire.

265
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:27,730
(TOGETHER) I call
 upon thy sacred name.

266
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:30,310
I call upon thy sacred name.

267
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:32,780
I call upon thy sacred name.

268
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:35,970
I invoke thee on
 thy sacred name.

269
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:39,520
I invoke thee on
 thy sacred name.

270
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,090
I invoke thee on
 thy sacred name.

271
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:47,840
(TOGETHER) I invoke
 thee on thy sacred name.

272
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,110
I invoke thee on
 thy sacred name.

273
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:52,510
I invoke thee on
 thy sacred name.

274
00:18:55,410 --> 00:19:07,230
By the flame before
 thee, I speak thy name.

275
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:09,720
(TOGETHER) I speak thy name.

276
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:20,180
Thy name is Lilith.

[BREATHING HARD]
 - What was that?

281
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:19,930
I don't know.

282
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:21,500
It sounded like it came
 from under the house.

283
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,690
I think was a storm.

284
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:24,600
Hello?

285
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,770
Notice something?

286
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:28,620
No thunder, clear skies.

287
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:29,750
What do you want
 me to tell you?

288
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:31,910
What about those lights?

289
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:33,920
Something was
 in there with us.

290
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,060
It's that book.
 That book.

291
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:39,040
That book did something.

292
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,050
Yeah, that's right.

293
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:41,360
It's this book.

294
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,670
It's from Salem.

295
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:47,910
Over 300 years old, used to
 raise demons and cast spells.

296

Except for one thing.

297
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:54,260
I bought it at Pan Pipes
 in Riverton a week ago.

298
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:55,240
It's a gag gift.

299
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,570
I got it for $3.

300
00:20:57,570 --> 00:20:59,260
It was either this
 or the satanic Bible.

301
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,490
It's all bullshit.

302
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:09,910

303
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:11,660
Well, then, what
 about the ritual?

00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:13,280
I'm good with rhymes.

305
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,890
I do it all the time.
 Come on.

306
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:17,980
Don't get mad.
 I just wanted to prove a point.

 god damn scared back there.
