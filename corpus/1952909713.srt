2
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:11,066
Snohomish. Snohomish.

3
00:03:12,234 --> 00:03:14,361
Everett next.

4
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:26,081
Hey, gorgeous.

5
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,083
Hey.

6
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:30,752
How you doing?
How was the funeral?

7
00:03:32,087 --> 00:03:34,047
I can't talk about it yet.

8
00:03:34,256 --> 00:03:36,216
Well, I'm glad you're back.

9
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:37,593
Did you miss me?

10
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:39,344
Good.

11
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:43,015
- How's the office?
- Boring without you there.

12
00:03:43,182 --> 00:03:45,851
No office intrigue? I wouldn't want
to miss anything.

13
00:03:46,018 --> 00:03:50,772
Well, let's see. Jerry switched
from regular to decaffeinated.

14
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:55,027
Oh, Erica went out with some guy in
a rock band who bit her ass all night.

15
00:03:55,194 --> 00:03:56,820
- Interesting.
- She thought so.

16
00:03:56,987 --> 00:03:58,530
She's seeing him again.

17
00:03:58,697 --> 00:04:02,117
And Ben Jordan was released
on parole.

18
00:04:02,284 --> 00:04:05,162
Don't tell me they relocated
him in Snohomish.

19
00:04:05,329 --> 00:04:07,831
Well, there's good news,
and there's bad news.

20
00:04:07,998 --> 00:04:09,583
What's the bad news?

21
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:12,336
They've relocated him
to Snohomish.

22
00:04:12,503 --> 00:04:15,797
- What's the good news?
- He's your case and not mine.

23
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:35,544
Dorothy, your husband's missed
our last five sessions.

24
00:05:35,711 --> 00:05:38,463
He obviously doesn't
want to change.

25
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:42,009
Or can't change.

26
00:05:49,433 --> 00:05:52,936
I think it's time to consider
going to the shelter.

27
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:55,606
Miss Mathews, that's my home.

28
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:57,941
That's where I get my mail.

29
00:05:58,108 --> 00:06:00,777
That's my phone number.

30
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:08,493
I'm not saying he's a monster.
I'm saying he's sick...

31
00:06:08,744 --> 00:06:13,165
...and he needs help. I know it's hard,
but if you press charges...

32
00:06:13,332 --> 00:06:16,752
...the court will make him
get the help he needs.

33
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:21,006
I have to go.

34
00:06:22,174 --> 00:06:24,176
Before I miss my bus for work.

35
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:26,345
All right, Dorothy.

36
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:29,223
I'm making an appointment
for your husband...

37
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:32,392
...for next Wednesday at 3.

38
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:39,983
If he doesn't show, I'll be
at your apartment Thursday...

39
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:42,528
...and we'll settle it one way
or the other.

40
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:45,739
Miss Mathews, thank you.

41
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:14,142
I heard a couple of new jokes
while you were gone.

42
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:15,978
They're really offensive.

43
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:17,729
So, what else is new?

44
00:07:17,896 --> 00:07:21,066
Okay. You wanna hear
the dead-baby joke or the sexist joke?

45
00:07:21,233 --> 00:07:22,818
What? No black jokes?

46
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:25,946
Yeah, I got a racist joke,
but those aren't funny anymore.

47
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:30,033
Give me the...

48
00:07:34,288 --> 00:07:36,039
Give me the sexist joke.

49
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:39,835
Good. What's the difference
between a whore and a bitch?

50
00:07:40,002 --> 00:07:43,589
Gee, I'm not sure, Steve-O.
What is the difference?

51
00:07:43,755 --> 00:07:47,634
A whore will sleep with anybody, and
a bitch will sleep with anybody but me.

52
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:49,678
Oh, God.

53
00:07:52,264 --> 00:07:54,850
How you doing? Good to see you.

54
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:57,853
- We still on for dinner?
- I'll see you later.

55
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:05,944
- Can I help you?
- Yes, they say you can. Is this you?

56
00:08:08,864 --> 00:08:10,699
How old?

57
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:13,535
Four, maybe.

58
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,997
The eyes.

59
00:08:17,623 --> 00:08:19,249
They're very pretty.

60
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:27,049
What can I do for you?

61
00:08:27,216 --> 00:08:29,384
I'm here to see my social worker.

62
00:08:29,551 --> 00:08:33,180
My parole officer told me
to see you right away.

63
00:08:33,388 --> 00:08:34,848
Ben Jordan.

64
00:08:38,477 --> 00:08:41,021
You really should have called...

65
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:43,649
...and set up an appointment.

66
00:08:44,775 --> 00:08:46,902
All right.

67
00:08:48,487 --> 00:08:51,323
Since you're here,
you might as well sit down.

68
00:09:01,834 --> 00:09:04,086
Do you like mysteries?

69
00:09:06,088 --> 00:09:07,256
What?

70
00:09:07,965 --> 00:09:09,842
The book you're reading.

71
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:13,971
I like the Travis McGee novels a lot.

72
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:19,810
Maybe you should try David Goodis.
He wrote a book called The Burglar.

73
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:21,937
It's excellent.

74
00:09:22,437 --> 00:09:23,981
I'll keep an eye out for him.

75
00:09:24,147 --> 00:09:26,066
I've been reading your file.

76
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:27,776
Good reading?

77
00:09:28,569 --> 00:09:30,487
As a matter of fact, it is.

78
00:09:30,654 --> 00:09:33,407
Hundred and forty-six IQ.

79
00:09:33,574 --> 00:09:35,534
You're a pretty smart fella.

80
00:09:35,701 --> 00:09:37,578
Oh, I don't know.

81
00:09:37,953 --> 00:09:40,747
Ted Bundy had 150.

82
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:46,962
Mr. Jordan, I'm not here
to judge your past.

83
00:09:47,171 --> 00:09:49,214
I'm here to help you with your future.

84
00:09:49,965 --> 00:09:53,135
What you did in prison was
impressive, but I'm not gonna lie.

85
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:56,638
With your record, it's not gonna
be easy getting you work.

86
00:09:57,181 --> 00:10:00,225
Right now, the best you can expect
is minimum wage.

87
00:10:00,392 --> 00:10:04,646
Certainly nothing up to your
capabilities, but if we work together...

88
00:10:04,855 --> 00:10:06,315
Miss Mathews?

89
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:08,734
Is it all right if I smoke?

90
00:10:08,901 --> 00:10:10,360
What?

91
00:10:10,736 --> 00:10:13,113
It helps ease the frustration.

92
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:16,909
You're not taking this very seriously,
are you?

93
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:20,829
Can we skip the therapy?
I'm seeing a shrink for that.

94
00:10:20,996 --> 00:10:22,372
I need a job.

95
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:28,253
All right. I'll give you a referral
to EDD before you leave.

96
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:30,756
Can I have it now?

97
00:10:36,637 --> 00:10:38,555
All right.

98
00:10:40,057 --> 00:10:41,475
Ask for...

99
00:10:41,642 --> 00:10:44,228
...Walt Deeter.

100
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:51,318
Good. It's a start.
Are we done?

101
00:10:52,069 --> 00:10:53,779
I guess.

102
00:10:58,033 --> 00:11:00,327
Ben, what did you do
when you arrived in town?

103
00:11:02,538 --> 00:11:05,249
Went to see my parole officer.

104
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:08,043
After that.

105
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:10,128
Went for a walk.

106
00:11:10,754 --> 00:11:13,215
I tried calling my mom.

107
00:11:14,383 --> 00:11:15,926
Bought a pair of socks.

108
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:20,931
Oh, and I had pizza.

109
00:11:21,557 --> 00:11:23,517
How did it taste?

110
00:11:24,268 --> 00:11:27,062
The best cardboard pizza
I've ever had.

111
00:11:28,397 --> 00:11:30,148
I can imagine.

112
00:11:32,234 --> 00:11:34,069
No, you can't.

113
00:11:51,795 --> 00:11:53,922
What did you think of Jordan?

114
00:11:54,131 --> 00:11:56,675
What do you mean?
Did I think he was cute?

115
00:11:57,885 --> 00:12:01,805
Ever since I saw him today,
whenever I go pee, I just get...

116
00:12:01,972 --> 00:12:03,974
Look, I was surprised
when I saw him...

117
00:12:04,141 --> 00:12:07,186
...and I was wondering if you had
the same reaction.

118
00:12:07,352 --> 00:12:11,064
No, I think, for a serial killer,
he is a damn fine-looking guy.

119
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:13,066
He's not a serial killer.

120
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:15,402
Right. He only kills
the ones he loves.

121
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:18,780
Look, I didn't talk to him. You did.

122
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:20,449
What do you think?

123
00:12:22,284 --> 00:12:23,493
Good.

124
00:12:23,869 --> 00:12:26,830
I think maybe he's changed
over the years.

125
00:12:28,373 --> 00:12:31,585
I read all the paperwork on him.
He deserved that parole.

126
00:12:32,336 --> 00:12:34,546
He's intelligent.
He has a kind of charm.

127
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:38,967
He got his master's degree
in psychology while he was inside.

128
00:12:40,177 --> 00:12:43,847
I don't think he's the same man
he was 15 years ago.

129
00:12:44,014 --> 00:12:48,018
Look, if a kid robs
a liquor store, okay...

130
00:12:48,185 --> 00:12:50,562
...and he shoots the guy behind
the counter...

131
00:12:50,729 --> 00:12:54,525
...I can believe that, after 15 years,
that kid might not do it again.

132
00:12:55,025 --> 00:12:58,779
Whatever it was that made Jordan
pick up that knife, slaughter his wife...

133
00:12:58,987 --> 00:13:01,615
...and his unborn baby
scares the hell out of me.

134
00:13:02,491 --> 00:13:03,784
Why?

135
00:13:03,951 --> 00:13:06,703
Because I don't like
how it makes me feel.

136
00:13:07,246 --> 00:13:09,331
How's that?

137
00:13:09,915 --> 00:13:12,793
Like they should have executed him.

138
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:20,425
Yeah, he's back inside.

139
00:13:21,051 --> 00:13:24,179
Hauled him out of the house last week
with a couple of keys.

140
00:13:24,388 --> 00:13:26,265
- Mr. Samuels?
- Yeah.

141
00:13:26,431 --> 00:13:30,811
Hi. Laura Mathews.
Ben Jordan's social worker.

142
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:33,647
Look, my man, I'll call you later.

143
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:37,901
Damn. Old Ben ain't do too bad
for himself, did he?

144
00:13:38,569 --> 00:13:41,697
Most social workers I seen,
they look like...

145
00:13:41,864 --> 00:13:43,615
Well, you know.

146
00:13:44,241 --> 00:13:45,492
Well, now, let's see...

147
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:47,119
Jordan. Jordan.

148
00:13:47,286 --> 00:13:50,205
I have some questions I need
answered in order to find...

149
00:13:50,372 --> 00:13:52,416
...Mr. Jordan work
in my community.

150
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:55,169
Fine.

151
00:13:55,669 --> 00:13:58,505
- Is it Mrs. Or Ms.?
- Ms.

152
00:13:58,672 --> 00:14:01,216
Well, Ms. Mathews...

153
00:14:01,717 --> 00:14:05,053
...l'll help you, but you ain't gonna find
that boy a job.

154
00:14:05,304 --> 00:14:06,680
What makes you say that?

155
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:10,434
Well, if I owned a hardware store
or a little gas station somewhere...

156
00:14:10,642 --> 00:14:13,395
...I wouldn't want that sick S.O.B.
On my property.

157
00:14:13,604 --> 00:14:18,066
I'll find Ben work, all right.
I'm very good at my job.

158
00:14:18,233 --> 00:14:21,111
Well, go ahead and do that then.

159
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:23,655
And good luck to you. I mean that.

160
00:14:25,449 --> 00:14:29,119
So, what can you tell me
about the Kathy Tudor murder?

161
00:14:31,872 --> 00:14:36,418
On the night of August 4, 1975, Ben
Jordan took a kitchen carving knife...

162
00:14:36,627 --> 00:14:38,712
...and stabbed his better half
30 times.

163
00:14:38,921 --> 00:14:41,381
- Thirty-six.
- Oh, my mistake. She was...

164
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:43,800
Six months pregnant.

165
00:14:44,301 --> 00:14:46,803
Now tell me something I don't know.

166
00:14:47,596 --> 00:14:49,348
There was a witness...

167
00:14:49,515 --> 00:14:52,768
...who heard the girl scream
around 11:30.

168
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:56,813
She didn't think much about it, and
went back to watch Johnny Carson.

169
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:59,942
Then a little past midnight,
she hears something else.

170
00:15:00,025 --> 00:15:03,612
So she goes to her window and sees
Jordan stagger out of his house...

171
00:15:03,779 --> 00:15:06,448
...with what looks like
a carving knife in his hand...

172
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:10,327
...toss it on the front lawn,
get in his car and drive off.

173
00:15:10,536 --> 00:15:14,164
The cops found him passed out drunk
in his car a little before dawn.

174
00:15:14,373 --> 00:15:16,792
The knife was the murder weapon.

175
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,127
His prints was all over it.

176
00:15:19,294 --> 00:15:21,088
And...

177
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:25,843
...the movie camera he filmed
the murder with was his own.

178
00:15:26,093 --> 00:15:27,302
What movie camera?

179
00:15:27,511 --> 00:15:30,180
Cops found a Super-8 movie camera
at the scene.

180
00:15:30,848 --> 00:15:33,684
Jordan filmed the murder.

181
00:15:35,018 --> 00:15:39,064
It's in the police files in Ellensburg.
Way I understand it, it makes...

182
00:15:39,231 --> 00:15:42,401
...Nightmare on Elm Street
look like Charlotte's Web.

183
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:46,405
Still want to find him a job?

184
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:53,662
I'm sorry I'm late.
Could I sit down?

185
00:15:55,163 --> 00:15:57,916
Sure. Make yourself comfortable.

186
00:16:01,044 --> 00:16:02,379
I...

187
00:16:03,172 --> 00:16:05,174
I have a lot I'd like
to talk about.

188
00:16:05,549 --> 00:16:07,176
Good.

189
00:16:07,384 --> 00:16:09,511
Where would you like to start?

190
00:16:10,053 --> 00:16:13,932
I heard you were
at Lee Samuels' office.

191
00:16:14,099 --> 00:16:17,686
You were nosing around, weren't you?
I wish you wouldn't.

192
00:16:23,066 --> 00:16:26,987
I don't think you're in a position
to tell me how to do my job.

193
00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:31,700
It might not be much,
but it is my life.

194
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:34,203
Did he tell you about the film?

195
00:16:35,037 --> 00:16:38,332
- Yes.
- Do you want to know why?

196
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:42,836
- Sure.
- So do I.

197
00:16:49,801 --> 00:16:51,678
You want to talk about it?

198
00:16:53,013 --> 00:16:55,557
I'm only here because I have to be.

199
00:16:55,891 --> 00:16:59,561
If you can get me a job,
I'll be grateful, and I'll walk.

200
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:03,315
Would it make you feel better
if I told you I didn't kill her?

201
00:17:03,482 --> 00:17:06,443
- Did you?
- Are you saying you'd believe me?

202
00:17:06,944 --> 00:17:09,029
Give me a chance.

203
00:17:13,784 --> 00:17:17,079
Gee, I don't know.

204
00:17:17,538 --> 00:17:20,582
You've built up some pretty good
defenses, haven't you?

205
00:17:20,749 --> 00:17:25,671
Yeah. Avoidance, denial.
I know the terms. They don't apply.

206
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:28,966
- You sure?
- Yes. Are you?

207
00:17:33,387 --> 00:17:37,933
You know what we're doing?
A little yard-bird sparring.

208
00:17:38,141 --> 00:17:39,935
You mean you're playing games.

209
00:17:40,352 --> 00:17:42,855
I don't pry into your past.

210
00:17:43,021 --> 00:17:45,023
I have to know who you are.

211
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:47,609
You have my file.

212
00:17:48,443 --> 00:17:52,114
I can't help you if you won't let me.

213
00:17:52,823 --> 00:17:55,492
Let me tell you something.

214
00:17:56,368 --> 00:18:00,122
If we were to have this kind
of an exchange in the joint...

215
00:18:00,289 --> 00:18:04,626
...one of us would end up
with a shank between the ribs.

216
00:18:04,793 --> 00:18:06,920
That isn't funny.

217
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:11,508
No, it isn't.

218
00:18:36,742 --> 00:18:40,704
This was the stuff on the reel
he shot first.

219
00:18:40,871 --> 00:18:43,498
They found a shitload
of these little reels.

220
00:18:43,707 --> 00:18:45,584
Jordan was quite
the home-movie nut.

221
00:18:45,834 --> 00:18:47,669
And I don't mind telling you...

222
00:18:47,836 --> 00:18:49,671
...this film was a bitch to get.

223
00:19:09,608 --> 00:19:13,070
Perfect picture of American
white-trash marital bliss.

224
00:19:52,609 --> 00:19:56,029
- What happened?
- His camera must have run out of film.

225
00:19:56,196 --> 00:20:00,242
- So he didn't actually film the murder.
- Not for lack of trying.

226
00:20:00,409 --> 00:20:02,870
But you never see Jordan
actually kill her.

227
00:20:03,078 --> 00:20:05,038
Disappointed?

228
00:20:06,081 --> 00:20:09,168
You made this film sound
like proof positive that he did it.

229
00:20:09,334 --> 00:20:12,296
What do you need?
To see the knife jabbing her belly?

230
00:20:12,462 --> 00:20:16,300
Yeah, that is what I need.
That's what I was expecting to see.

231
00:20:16,466 --> 00:20:20,262
I was confused before I watched this,
and now I'm even more confused.

232
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:22,097
Confused?

233
00:20:22,306 --> 00:20:24,183
Confused about what? His guilt?

234
00:20:24,349 --> 00:20:27,519
Kathy not only knew the murderer,
she was comfortable with him.

235
00:20:27,686 --> 00:20:30,647
She offered him a beer.
She did this little dance for him.

236
00:20:30,814 --> 00:20:33,775
I seriously doubt she'd act
that way for just some burglar.

237
00:20:33,942 --> 00:20:35,777
Maybe it was somebody
else she knew.

238
00:20:35,944 --> 00:20:38,280
Yeah. You can say "maybe"
all goddamn day...

239
00:20:38,488 --> 00:20:41,450
...but I don't think you
really believe that.

240
00:20:41,909 --> 00:20:46,371
I'm playing devil's advocate here.
That wasn't a crime of passion.

241
00:20:46,538 --> 00:20:49,374
That was planned,
something a serial killer might do.

242
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,669
He planned to kill her,
he even filmed the event...

243
00:20:52,836 --> 00:20:55,464
...and after he did it,
he got blind stinking drunk?

244
00:20:55,631 --> 00:20:58,509
First, he uses method,
then he's out of control. Come on.

245
00:20:58,967 --> 00:21:02,346
Maybe you give too much credit.
Maybe he isn't a natural-born killer.

246
00:21:02,513 --> 00:21:06,391
Maybe he got himself all drunk
because what he did freaked him out.

247
00:21:06,558 --> 00:21:09,937
- Now who's Mr. Maybe?
- Yeah, maybe so.

248
00:21:10,145 --> 00:21:13,815
But my "maybes" is better than your
"maybes." I gotta get my butt home.

249
00:21:14,691 --> 00:21:17,861
Lee, I sure appreciate you getting
a copy of that film for me.

250
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:20,155
Like you said,
we're working together.

251
00:21:21,323 --> 00:21:24,576
Would you mind too terribly
if I borrowed it for a while?

252
00:21:25,202 --> 00:21:27,996
Would you mind if I ask you why?

253
00:21:34,878 --> 00:21:36,380
Good night, Ms. Mathews.

254
00:21:36,547 --> 00:21:39,675
Good night, Mr. Samuels.

255
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,333
Hello?

256
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,628
Yeah. Hi, it's Ben.

257
00:22:17,504 --> 00:22:19,423
Ben Jordan.

258
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:22,009
How did you get my number?

259
00:22:22,176 --> 00:22:24,511
Oh, from the phone book.

260
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:29,141
There were two L. Mathews.
One of them was a dentist.

261
00:22:30,142 --> 00:22:31,810
But I've been thinking...

262
00:22:32,769 --> 00:22:34,396
...maybe I haven't been fair.

263
00:22:34,605 --> 00:22:38,525
You're only trying to help,
and I've been slapping you around.

264
00:22:41,111 --> 00:22:42,779
Are you still there?

265
00:22:44,031 --> 00:22:45,365
Laura?

266
00:22:45,532 --> 00:22:47,201
Yes.

267
00:22:47,367 --> 00:22:49,453
I'm calling...

268
00:22:50,621 --> 00:22:53,081
...to say I'm sorry.

269
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:54,917
That's all.

270
00:22:58,086 --> 00:23:00,047
Good night.

271
00:23:00,797 --> 00:23:02,216
Good night.

272
00:23:38,168 --> 00:23:40,629
If you'd committed a crime and
the evidence was against you...

273
00:23:40,796 --> 00:23:43,465
...how long would it take
to bring a guilty verdict?

274
00:23:43,674 --> 00:23:46,301
- Laura.
- I'm just asking.

275
00:23:46,844 --> 00:23:48,095
A day or two.

276
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,682
Look, don't get emotional
about this one.

277
00:23:52,516 --> 00:23:54,351
Are you being protective?

278
00:23:54,518 --> 00:23:56,395
Yeah. I'm being a little protective.

279
00:23:56,562 --> 00:23:58,605
Well, bless your heart.

280
00:23:58,772 --> 00:24:01,817
Okay, Nancy Drew, listen.

281
00:24:02,025 --> 00:24:05,946
You know, one of these days, you're
gonna realize that this platonic shit...

282
00:24:06,154 --> 00:24:09,658
...is for the birds
and that it has been me all along.

283
00:24:09,867 --> 00:24:11,869
But that glorious and magical day...

284
00:24:12,077 --> 00:24:14,872
...is not going to happen
if Ben Jordan kills you.

285
00:24:15,038 --> 00:24:18,166
Did you ever suppose
that he might be innocent?

286
00:24:19,877 --> 00:24:21,378
Yeah.

287
00:24:22,004 --> 00:24:23,589
A man goes to trial...

288
00:24:23,755 --> 00:24:26,842
...and he is innocent
until proven guilty.

289
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:30,637
And then he's convicted, and he's
guilty unless proven innocent.

290
00:24:30,804 --> 00:24:33,390
So don't make me to be some
narrow-minded jerk...

291
00:24:33,557 --> 00:24:35,475
...because you're being naive.

292
00:24:35,642 --> 00:24:37,853
There are things
that don't make any sense.

293
00:24:38,061 --> 00:24:39,563
Yeah, I'm sure there are.

294
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:43,192
But you're not a detective.
You're a social worker. So...

295
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:48,530
...talk to him, give him advice,
find him a job. Speaking of which...

296
00:24:48,739 --> 00:24:50,741
...I think I got him one.
- You did?

297
00:24:50,949 --> 00:24:52,910
- Where?
- H & R Meats.

298
00:24:53,076 --> 00:24:56,955
Swing shift. Strong back stuff,
strictly donkey work.

299
00:24:57,122 --> 00:24:59,917
That's okay. He just needs a job.

300
00:25:00,501 --> 00:25:02,002
Did you tell him?

301
00:25:02,169 --> 00:25:04,588
No, I figured he'd rather
hear it from you.

302
00:25:05,714 --> 00:25:07,508
Thanks for the help, Steve.

303
00:25:07,674 --> 00:25:11,512
Sure. But if somebody ends up
hanging from a meat hook...

304
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:14,264
...I am not taking responsibility.

305
00:25:22,439 --> 00:25:25,442
I wanted to give you something...

306
00:25:25,609 --> 00:25:27,569
...for your help.

307
00:25:31,365 --> 00:25:33,408
I got it...

308
00:25:37,162 --> 00:25:39,414
This is beautiful.

309
00:25:40,415 --> 00:25:41,667
Did you do this?

310
00:25:42,417 --> 00:25:45,462
I noticed you like flowers.

311
00:25:50,008 --> 00:25:52,261
You should really thank Steve.

312
00:25:52,678 --> 00:25:55,055
When I get a chance, I will.

313
00:25:58,475 --> 00:26:01,270
It's been a while since I had a drink.

314
00:26:05,816 --> 00:26:07,442
I must admit I'm surprised.

315
00:26:07,651 --> 00:26:10,028
- About the job?
- That we're having dinner.

316
00:26:10,195 --> 00:26:12,781
I'm not exactly your mother's idea
of a date.

317
00:26:13,323 --> 00:26:14,825
You don't know my mother.

318
00:26:17,578 --> 00:26:19,997
Anyway, this isn't a date.

319
00:26:20,163 --> 00:26:21,456
Oh, what is it?

320
00:26:21,665 --> 00:26:24,960
Support for the poor
and misguided?

321
00:26:25,127 --> 00:26:27,462
You should put that on your wall.

322
00:26:29,423 --> 00:26:32,134
You're not making this easy.

323
00:26:33,886 --> 00:26:35,846
I didn't know it was supposed to be.

324
00:26:37,264 --> 00:26:38,473
I'm sorry.

325
00:26:39,349 --> 00:26:41,602
I'm doing it again.

326
00:26:41,768 --> 00:26:44,479
I've been away too long.

327
00:26:44,938 --> 00:26:47,691
I forget how to behave sometimes.

328
00:26:49,026 --> 00:26:51,320
You want to talk about
something else?

329
00:26:51,862 --> 00:26:53,238
What about you?

330
00:26:54,198 --> 00:26:57,117
Who is Laura Mathews?

331
00:26:57,326 --> 00:26:59,995
Or does it only go one way?

332
00:27:02,331 --> 00:27:05,292
I don't think I want to play.

333
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:09,630
I don't mean bare your soul.
I mean...

334
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:12,466
...little stuff like...

335
00:27:12,883 --> 00:27:15,010
...where were you born?

336
00:27:15,177 --> 00:27:17,930
Who would your mother approve of?

337
00:27:24,019 --> 00:27:26,063
Another time, maybe.

338
00:27:27,731 --> 00:27:29,691
Avoidance?

339
00:27:32,486 --> 00:27:34,404
Denial.

340
00:28:33,881 --> 00:28:35,757
I'm sorry.

341
00:28:35,966 --> 00:28:39,636
I didn't mean to scare you.
Door was open.

342
00:28:40,679 --> 00:28:44,349
Would it make you feel better
if we had some more light?

343
00:28:46,602 --> 00:28:48,478
I'd feel better.

344
00:29:00,324 --> 00:29:02,326
This is good work.

345
00:29:02,492 --> 00:29:07,581
My father did it. He died
before he could finish it.

346
00:29:07,789 --> 00:29:10,125
- Well, it's nice.
- What are you doing here?

347
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:22,054
I've been trying to understand
your interest in me.

348
00:29:22,221 --> 00:29:25,974
I've been turning it around in my head.
It doesn't make any sense.

349
00:29:26,183 --> 00:29:30,020
I mean, maybe it's this angel-of-mercy
picture on your wall.

350
00:29:30,187 --> 00:29:33,982
Or maybe you really
do like mysteries.

351
00:29:34,525 --> 00:29:37,569
So I thought I'd ask.

352
00:29:37,778 --> 00:29:40,906
We'll talk about it tomorrow
in the office.

353
00:29:41,949 --> 00:29:44,034
I don't think you're being honest.

354
00:29:45,035 --> 00:29:46,495
Please.

355
00:29:47,996 --> 00:29:50,082
I'm making you nervous.

356
00:29:51,875 --> 00:29:53,752
Yes.

357
00:29:55,838 --> 00:29:58,048
All right.

358
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:01,677
Give me a second.

359
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:10,477
You want to know if I'm innocent?

360
00:30:12,938 --> 00:30:17,901
The last time I was innocent
was 15 years ago in court.

361
00:30:18,235 --> 00:30:21,321
Innocence doesn't exist in prison.

362
00:30:21,697 --> 00:30:23,532
It doesn't matter.

363
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:25,242
And nobody cares.

364
00:30:26,827 --> 00:30:28,745
If you care...

365
00:30:30,247 --> 00:30:32,207
...stay away from me.

366
00:30:32,416 --> 00:30:34,168
Don't ask me out to dinner.

367
00:30:36,003 --> 00:30:38,338
I get confused.

368
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:47,139
You can't go out in that.
I'll give you a ride home.

369
00:30:48,432 --> 00:30:51,018
Rain's never killed anybody.

370
00:30:56,648 --> 00:30:59,985
Here. Take this.

371
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,577
Angel of mercy.

372
00:31:43,612 --> 00:31:45,280
Who the hell are you?

373
00:31:45,489 --> 00:31:47,574
- Mr. Tudor?
- Yeah. That's me.

374
00:31:47,741 --> 00:31:49,868
Hi. My name is Laura Mathews.

375
00:31:50,035 --> 00:31:52,120
I'd like to talk to you
about Ben Jordan.

376
00:31:52,329 --> 00:31:54,915
Hey, I'd love to talk
about that cocksucker.

377
00:31:55,123 --> 00:31:57,334
You want some cocoa?

378
00:31:57,501 --> 00:31:59,711
Oh, no, thanks.

379
00:31:59,878 --> 00:32:02,214
Five years early for good behavior.

380
00:32:02,381 --> 00:32:04,967
What the fuck is good
about his behavior?

381
00:32:05,175 --> 00:32:07,427
It's a slap in the face
to my daughter...

382
00:32:07,594 --> 00:32:10,430
...to me, to the whole community.

383
00:32:13,183 --> 00:32:17,604
Could you tell me a little
about Kathy's friends?

384
00:32:17,771 --> 00:32:19,648
She had a few girlfriends.

385
00:32:19,815 --> 00:32:21,275
Not too many.

386
00:32:21,483 --> 00:32:23,527
How could I get in touch with them?

387
00:32:23,694 --> 00:32:25,529
They got married and moved away.

388
00:32:25,737 --> 00:32:27,823
Besides, I was Kathy's best friend.

389
00:32:28,198 --> 00:32:31,201
It wasn't like the normal
father-daughter relationship.

390
00:32:31,994 --> 00:32:34,788
We were good friends.
The best.

391
00:32:38,083 --> 00:32:39,501
You look tired.

392
00:32:40,752 --> 00:32:42,004
I'm a little tired.

393
00:32:42,588 --> 00:32:44,381
Well...

394
00:32:44,548 --> 00:32:47,384
...I have got the cure for that.

395
00:32:47,885 --> 00:32:49,595
Magic hands.

396
00:32:49,761 --> 00:32:51,513
No, thanks. I'm ticklish.

397
00:32:51,722 --> 00:32:55,434
Do you have Kathy's high-school
yearbook or anything?

398
00:32:56,935 --> 00:32:59,438
It's buried somewhere in this stuff.

399
00:33:00,063 --> 00:33:02,691
What paper did you say
you work for?

400
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:05,903
I'm not a reporter.
I'm with Social Services.

401
00:33:06,111 --> 00:33:08,363
Up in Snohomish.

402
00:33:08,572 --> 00:33:10,073
Where they sent Ben Jordan?

403
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:13,368
Yeah. I'm Ben Jordan's
social worker.

404
00:33:13,577 --> 00:33:15,078
Get out of here.

405
00:33:15,245 --> 00:33:18,540
- Please...
- Get the hell off my property!

406
00:33:32,429 --> 00:33:36,141
Do I have to call the authorities?
I guess I do.

407
00:33:36,391 --> 00:33:40,062
No, you don't.
Thank you very much for your time.

408
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:15,472
Oh, you're a pretty lady, aren't you?

409
00:34:16,682 --> 00:34:20,143
Hello. I'm Laura Mathews.

410
00:34:20,936 --> 00:34:25,941
Hello. My name is Larry, and I am very
happy to make your acquaintance.

411
00:34:26,149 --> 00:34:30,362
Well, Larry, I'm very happy
to make your acquaintance too.

412
00:34:30,529 --> 00:34:34,867
I came here to ask you
some questions. Would you mind?

413
00:34:35,033 --> 00:34:37,578
- No.
- Good.

414
00:34:38,245 --> 00:34:44,084
A long time ago you were at a trial.
It was a murder trial for Ben Jordan.

415
00:34:44,751 --> 00:34:49,173
You told all the people that you saw
somebody else go into that house.

416
00:34:49,339 --> 00:34:51,258
Do you remember that?

417
00:34:52,092 --> 00:34:53,927
Yeah, but that...

418
00:34:55,095 --> 00:34:56,805
Yeah.

419
00:34:57,431 --> 00:35:00,017
L... I was...

420
00:35:01,143 --> 00:35:04,104
Well, that was when I was just a kid.

421
00:35:04,313 --> 00:35:10,110
It was a long time ago. I was hoping
you could tell me what it was you saw.

422
00:35:10,652 --> 00:35:12,654
Do you remember that night, Larry?

423
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:16,116
Sort of.

424
00:35:16,283 --> 00:35:18,744
Did you know Ben Jordan?

425
00:35:19,578 --> 00:35:21,288
He was...

426
00:35:21,455 --> 00:35:24,458
He was a friend of my brother's.

427
00:35:26,376 --> 00:35:29,421
Ben Jordan
was your brother's friend?

428
00:35:30,756 --> 00:35:33,592
But it wasn't Ben.

429
00:35:35,719 --> 00:35:39,139
It wasn't Ben you saw
go into the house?

430
00:35:39,348 --> 00:35:41,517
It was somebody else?

431
00:35:44,311 --> 00:35:46,647
You sure about that?

432
00:35:47,356 --> 00:35:51,485
Well, I swore on the Bible.

433
00:35:51,902 --> 00:35:56,990
And you can go to hell if you swear
on the Bible and it ain't the truth.

434
00:35:57,491 --> 00:36:00,202
What did the other person look like?

435
00:36:01,745 --> 00:36:06,708
Well, he was... He was older.

436
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,585
He was bigger.

437
00:36:12,172 --> 00:36:14,800
Well, I don't remember too good.

438
00:36:18,679 --> 00:36:22,558
Well, Larry, it's been
a pleasure talking with you.

439
00:36:22,766 --> 00:36:24,476
Likewise.

440
00:36:24,643 --> 00:36:26,103
Thanks very much.

441
00:36:43,787 --> 00:36:45,789
Listen, lady...

442
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:49,793
...if you wanna talk to somebody
around here, you talk to me.

443
00:36:50,878 --> 00:36:53,630
- What?
- Larry is very happy here.

444
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:56,884
I take good care of him,
and he takes good care of me.

445
00:36:57,134 --> 00:37:00,095
Mr. Canipe, I think you have me
confused with somebody else.

446
00:37:00,304 --> 00:37:02,639
- You're a social worker, aren't you?
- I am.

447
00:37:02,806 --> 00:37:07,186
Jesus Christ! How many fucking times
are you people gonna come out here?

448
00:37:07,352 --> 00:37:10,439
I'm not here about you
or Larry or your farm. L...

449
00:37:10,647 --> 00:37:12,649
- The county didn't send you here?
- No.

450
00:37:14,026 --> 00:37:17,738
I'm Ben Jordan's social worker.
He's living in Snohomish now.

451
00:37:17,905 --> 00:37:22,117
I thought I'd come down here and
find out what I could about his case.

452
00:37:22,284 --> 00:37:25,746
You came down here
to talk to Larry about Ben?

453
00:37:25,954 --> 00:37:27,414
Yeah.

454
00:37:31,126 --> 00:37:35,547
Sorry. I owe you a big apology.

455
00:37:38,008 --> 00:37:41,470
Oh, boy. I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.

456
00:37:41,678 --> 00:37:43,972
Well, I did mean to scare you...

457
00:37:44,181 --> 00:37:46,808
...but you're not the person
I wanted to scare.

458
00:37:46,975 --> 00:37:51,563
I'm a trucker, and every so often
I have to go off on long hauls...

459
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:54,066
...and leave Larry by himself here.

460
00:37:54,233 --> 00:37:57,569
Well, that's okay because Larry
can take care of himself.

461
00:37:57,778 --> 00:38:02,658
Once in a while they send somebody
to give us a hard time about it.

462
00:38:02,866 --> 00:38:06,662
- It's okay. I understand.
- Did Larry help you out?

463
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:09,414
Sort of. He said that
you and Ben were friends.

464
00:38:09,581 --> 00:38:13,585
Me and Ben were friends, all right.
He was a real hell-raiser.

465
00:38:13,752 --> 00:38:17,548
- I got him out of a lot of trouble.
- Yeah? What kind of trouble?

466
00:38:17,714 --> 00:38:23,971
I'm making it sound worse than it was.
Just kid stuff. Wildness.

467
00:38:24,388 --> 00:38:27,266
Do you think he killed Kathy Tudor?

468
00:38:29,309 --> 00:38:32,771
I don't want to. I don't know.

469
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:35,357
That was a long time ago.

470
00:38:35,607 --> 00:38:38,819
At the time, I knew he didn't do it.

471
00:38:38,986 --> 00:38:41,446
But now I don't know whether or not.

472
00:38:41,905 --> 00:38:45,075
If you thought he didn't do it,
do you have any ideas who did?

473
00:38:45,242 --> 00:38:47,327
I don't know.

474
00:38:48,036 --> 00:38:52,332
The guy Larry saw, I guess.
It could have been anybody.

475
00:38:52,499 --> 00:38:54,710
- Well, thank you very much.
- Sure.

476
00:38:54,877 --> 00:38:56,545
I appreciate it.

477
00:38:57,588 --> 00:39:00,507
If you're Ben's social worker,
you're gonna see him, right?

478
00:39:00,674 --> 00:39:01,884
Yeah, I'll see him.

479
00:39:02,092 --> 00:39:06,638
Would you tell him that Todd says...?
Oh, what does Todd say?

480
00:39:06,847 --> 00:39:11,268
Tell him Todd says good luck,
and he's an ugly son of a bitch.

481
00:39:11,476 --> 00:39:14,188
- Sure.
- All right. Thank you.

482
00:39:25,199 --> 00:39:29,161
Oh, Lord have mercy, I sure didn't
help Ben much during that trial.

483
00:39:29,328 --> 00:39:34,708
I was, at the time,
a little full of myself.

484
00:39:35,417 --> 00:39:39,755
Well, I've learned to loosen up
just a little since then.

485
00:39:39,963 --> 00:39:41,798
Here. It's Ben's file.

486
00:39:41,965 --> 00:39:44,968
Here we go. Ben's unemployed.
Been drinking.

487
00:39:45,135 --> 00:39:49,556
He has got
an 0.18 blood alcohol level.

488
00:39:49,723 --> 00:39:52,851
0.18. I mean, that's a heavy load
we're talking about.

489
00:39:53,018 --> 00:39:55,270
We're talking like
falling-down drunk.

490
00:39:55,479 --> 00:39:58,732
- The way I see it, Ben comes home...
- Excuse me for interrupting.

491
00:39:58,899 --> 00:40:02,528
But how'd you know Ben got drunk
before he got home, instead of after?

492
00:40:02,694 --> 00:40:06,782
The clerk that sold him the booze
saw him guzzling it out in the car.

493
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:10,452
All right. Listen to this.
Say I'm Ben, and you're Kathy, okay?

494
00:40:10,661 --> 00:40:12,746
I'm trying to stab you. All right.

495
00:40:12,955 --> 00:40:19,253
As drunk as I am, my thrusts are gonna
be all over the place. Am I right?

496
00:40:20,295 --> 00:40:21,964
They weren't.

497
00:40:22,297 --> 00:40:27,219
All of them were straight in.
Dead center.

498
00:40:28,512 --> 00:40:31,640
- Sorry. Am I upsetting you?
- I'll manage.

499
00:40:31,849 --> 00:40:36,770
Good. There's another thing.
Why in the hell the home movies?

500
00:40:36,979 --> 00:40:42,317
- Yeah. That's what I've been thinking.
- Then there's Kathy. Sweet Kathy.

501
00:40:42,526 --> 00:40:45,696
There she sits, smiling.

502
00:40:45,904 --> 00:40:47,573
Her husband comes home tanked...

503
00:40:47,781 --> 00:40:50,033
...and she's gonna offer him
another beer?

504
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:52,494
You're right.
It doesn't make any sense.

505
00:40:52,661 --> 00:40:56,373
You know what?
It never did make any sense.

506
00:40:56,540 --> 00:41:01,170
All they ever had on Ben
was circumstantial evidence.

507
00:41:01,795 --> 00:41:07,467
The bottom line to this is Bill Tudor,
a very powerful man in this town.

508
00:41:07,634 --> 00:41:10,846
Member of the Moose Lodge,
Masons.

509
00:41:11,054 --> 00:41:15,517
You see, he wanted action. Some
bastard had murdered his daughter...

510
00:41:15,726 --> 00:41:18,854
...and he wanted
some bastard to pay for it.

511
00:41:19,521 --> 00:41:23,859
- You saying Ben was framed?
- No, not intentionally framed. No.

512
00:41:24,067 --> 00:41:28,113
I mean Ben could have done it.
And that was good enough for them.

513
00:42:07,236 --> 00:42:11,073
They said you were gonna be
back this afternoon.

514
00:42:11,281 --> 00:42:16,870
- Called your office. You mind?
- That's okay. Sit down.

515
00:42:20,832 --> 00:42:23,627
I just got back from Ellensburg.

516
00:42:23,794 --> 00:42:27,089
- I talked with people.
- You did what?

517
00:42:27,297 --> 00:42:29,925
Carlton Daniels.
Larry and Todd Canipe.

518
00:42:30,133 --> 00:42:34,471
- I asked you not to nose around.
- Ben, I know you're innocent.

519
00:42:34,638 --> 00:42:37,683
I know you didn't kill Kathy.
It was somebody else.

520
00:42:37,850 --> 00:42:41,854
Why don't you leave me alone?
I don't need to go through this again...

521
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:46,775
...so you can feel like
the angel of fucking mercy! Damn!

522
00:42:48,527 --> 00:42:51,405
What's the big deal
about trusting me?

523
00:42:51,989 --> 00:42:54,950
Why do you want to go on hiding?

524
00:42:55,784 --> 00:42:57,995
You'd rather feel sorry for yourself...

525
00:42:58,203 --> 00:43:01,039
...than clear your name
or find out who killed your wife.

526
00:43:01,206 --> 00:43:02,624
What are you trying to do?

527
00:43:02,833 --> 00:43:05,210
Or does it feel safer
to stay behind bars?

528
00:43:05,377 --> 00:43:06,837
None of your damn business.

529
00:43:07,045 --> 00:43:09,006
You wanna stay there,
I won't stop you.

530
00:43:09,173 --> 00:43:11,466
Oh, psychology. Give me a break.

531
00:43:12,342 --> 00:43:14,261
Ben...

532
00:43:14,803 --> 00:43:17,514
...you didn't do it, did you?

533
00:43:18,974 --> 00:43:23,854
I know the truth.
I don't need to prove it to anybody.

534
00:43:24,021 --> 00:43:27,024
I don't care. I really don't.

535
00:43:28,901 --> 00:43:30,402
I do.

536
00:43:56,595 --> 00:43:58,764
I guess I'd better go.

537
00:45:33,275 --> 00:45:36,361
Following me is a little melodramatic,
don't you think, Steve?

538
00:45:36,528 --> 00:45:40,449
I'm not following you, okay? What
the hell do you think you're doing?

539
00:45:40,616 --> 00:45:43,577
I know our relationship hasn't
exactly been what you want.

540
00:45:43,744 --> 00:45:46,663
You think I'm jealous?!
Give me more credit than that!

541
00:45:46,830 --> 00:45:51,168
Look, if you were fucking a milkman,
I would be jealous. But you're not.

542
00:45:51,335 --> 00:45:54,755
- Jesus Christ, this guy is dangerous.
- Not to me.

543
00:45:54,922 --> 00:45:57,508
Because he hasn't left you
in a pool of blood yet?

544
00:45:57,674 --> 00:46:00,260
- You're melodramatic.
- Fucking-A, I'm melodramatic.

545
00:46:00,427 --> 00:46:03,639
- He wasn't guilty.
- It'd be nice if it was true, but it's not.

546
00:46:03,847 --> 00:46:08,727
Look, Steve, you don't know anything
about the trial, the case or the man.

547
00:46:08,894 --> 00:46:12,356
I know the facts, and I know my heart.
And they say he's innocent.

548
00:46:12,523 --> 00:46:15,651
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

549
00:47:17,671 --> 00:47:19,798
I got it working.

550
00:47:20,424 --> 00:47:23,010
I felt like doing something.

551
00:47:24,011 --> 00:47:28,682
I also wanted to say
I'm sorry for the last time.

552
00:47:29,224 --> 00:47:31,226
Don't worry about it.

553
00:47:47,618 --> 00:47:50,787
You have hands like my father's.

554
00:47:53,123 --> 00:47:56,335
Strong and beautiful hands.

555
00:47:59,463 --> 00:48:02,257
Like they're carved out of stone.

556
00:51:25,836 --> 00:51:28,797
- Morning.
- Hi.

557
00:51:30,090 --> 00:51:33,927
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. I had a nightmare.

558
00:51:34,344 --> 00:51:38,891
I woke up, didn't remember
where I was or how I got there.

559
00:51:39,725 --> 00:51:43,145
I watched you breathe for a while.

560
00:51:55,365 --> 00:51:59,119
- How long has he been there?
- Since I got up.

561
00:52:01,371 --> 00:52:03,790
It's what he does.

562
00:52:04,583 --> 00:52:06,335
I know.

563
00:52:24,770 --> 00:52:26,980
Jordan, come here.

564
00:52:30,275 --> 00:52:33,195
- Mr. Lundy.
- I want to talk to you.

565
00:52:33,904 --> 00:52:36,031
The boss is watching.

566
00:52:42,287 --> 00:52:46,041
Listen. I want you
to understand something.

567
00:52:46,208 --> 00:52:50,504
I am watching you. You do anything
to violate your parole...

568
00:52:50,671 --> 00:52:54,800
...and I mean anything, you are
back inside. Do you understand that?

569
00:52:54,967 --> 00:52:58,887
If anything happens to Laura,
you're not gonna make it to trial.

570
00:52:59,096 --> 00:53:00,389
I guarantee it.

571
00:53:05,602 --> 00:53:07,145
Mr. Lundy.

572
00:53:08,689 --> 00:53:10,274
Thanks for the job.

573
00:53:15,153 --> 00:53:18,407
The second he steps out of line,
I want to be the first to know.

574
00:53:28,750 --> 00:53:32,588
- Where did you meet her?
- In a bar.

575
00:53:32,796 --> 00:53:35,174
The kind of place
where the floor is covered...

576
00:53:35,340 --> 00:53:39,595
...with sawdust and busted teeth.
Real romantic.

577
00:53:41,388 --> 00:53:46,518
What about you?
You must have had guys, like Steve.

578
00:53:46,685 --> 00:53:50,105
- Steve is...
- Just a friend?

579
00:53:50,272 --> 00:53:53,609
Not always. We had an affair.
It lasted about a month...

580
00:53:53,775 --> 00:53:56,403
...before I decided
we were better off as friends.

581
00:53:56,570 --> 00:53:58,488
That figures.

582
00:54:00,490 --> 00:54:03,285
- Were you ever married?
- Once.

583
00:54:03,452 --> 00:54:06,914
He had an affair,
and so I threw him out.

584
00:54:12,669 --> 00:54:17,508
He did something, knowing if I found
out I'd be hurt, and he did it anyway.

585
00:54:18,217 --> 00:54:21,220
Are you wondering
if this is a mistake?

586
00:54:35,526 --> 00:54:39,154
Do you know what these taste like?
Come here.

587
00:54:40,656 --> 00:54:42,157
Oysters.

588
00:54:47,079 --> 00:54:49,873
How do you know it's not poisonous?

589
00:54:54,628 --> 00:54:56,129
You first.

590
00:54:56,839 --> 00:54:58,298
Me second.

591
00:55:02,386 --> 00:55:04,847
Like oysters, huh?

592
00:55:24,825 --> 00:55:26,535
You're right.

593
00:55:27,077 --> 00:55:29,329
It's delicious.

594
00:55:31,373 --> 00:55:32,749
Your turn.

595
00:55:34,042 --> 00:55:35,502
No.

596
00:55:36,378 --> 00:55:38,714
I'm gonna have some of yours.

597
00:56:08,744 --> 00:56:10,704
- Hi.
- Hi. Northwest Parcel.

598
00:56:10,913 --> 00:56:14,124
- Can you just sign right there?
- Sure.

599
00:56:14,458 --> 00:56:17,252
- Who's it from?
- Got me.

600
00:56:18,462 --> 00:56:20,839
- Great.
- Thanks. Bye.

601
00:56:49,993 --> 00:56:53,872
- Something wrong?
- Just some more stuff of my dad's.

602
00:56:54,081 --> 00:56:57,543
- I'm sorry. I gotta run.
- Okay.

603
00:56:59,294 --> 00:57:03,173
- Want some coffee?
- Oh, great.

604
00:57:04,216 --> 00:57:05,801
Thank you.

605
00:57:06,009 --> 00:57:07,511
So...

606
00:57:11,306 --> 00:57:13,141
I'll see you later.

607
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:19,147
- You call me.
- Sure.

608
00:57:47,801 --> 00:57:53,891
Got your gift the other day.
Am I supposed to say thanks?

609
00:57:54,057 --> 00:57:58,270
- What gift?
- Come on. Stop acting like a baby.

610
00:57:58,437 --> 00:58:03,317
The way you tried to deliver your
message was incredibly insulting.

611
00:58:03,483 --> 00:58:06,195
I don't know what
you're talking about.

612
00:58:12,117 --> 00:58:14,411
I can't be responsible
for your heart...

613
00:58:14,578 --> 00:58:17,289
...when it's out in the open
on your sleeve like that.

614
00:58:17,456 --> 00:58:19,124
Okay.

615
00:58:47,069 --> 00:58:48,862
Hi. Thanks for coming.

616
00:58:49,571 --> 00:58:52,407
Yeah. No trouble.
Glad I can help you out.

617
00:58:52,866 --> 00:58:55,369
Get you anything while you wait?
A cup of coffee?

618
00:58:55,577 --> 00:58:57,746
No, I'm fine.

619
00:58:59,414 --> 00:59:05,128
- Mr. Canipe, what are you doing here?
- I came to talk to you, ma'am.

620
00:59:05,295 --> 00:59:07,047
Sit down.

621
00:59:08,131 --> 00:59:11,260
- What about?
- Well...

622
00:59:13,387 --> 00:59:18,433
It's about my brother's testimony.
Larry was lying.

623
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:22,271
He was nowhere near that house
the night Kathy died.

624
00:59:23,355 --> 00:59:26,900
Why would your brother
perjure himself like that?

625
00:59:27,234 --> 00:59:29,611
He did it because I asked him to.

626
00:59:31,238 --> 00:59:32,447
Why?

627
00:59:32,614 --> 00:59:36,952
I guess it seems silly now, but
at the time, I was doing Ben a favor.

628
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:42,291
I was his best friend, and nobody with
good sense was gonna listen to me.

629
00:59:42,583 --> 00:59:44,501
You know, I hoped the fact...

630
00:59:44,668 --> 00:59:49,256
...that Larry was a kid and slow
would give him sympathy.

631
00:59:49,423 --> 00:59:52,301
Instead, the lawyers
just used it against him.

632
00:59:52,467 --> 00:59:54,803
Why didn't you tell me this
in Ellensburg?

633
00:59:55,012 --> 01:00:00,517
You came to the farm and asked
questions, and I just stuck to my story.

634
01:00:00,684 --> 01:00:05,939
Then, well, about a week ago,
Mr. Lundy there...

635
01:00:06,106 --> 01:00:10,152
...he came to the farm, and he said
you might be in some trouble.

636
01:00:10,819 --> 01:00:12,988
I got spooked.

637
01:00:13,447 --> 01:00:17,242
Well, thank you very much
for telling us your story.

638
01:00:18,660 --> 01:00:21,622
Have a pleasant trip back
to Ellensburg.

639
01:00:21,955 --> 01:00:25,042
- Good day, Mr. Canipe.
- So long.

640
01:00:29,213 --> 01:00:30,923
Let me call you back.

641
01:00:31,507 --> 01:00:34,051
- You think you're pretty clever.
- You are mad now.

642
01:00:34,218 --> 01:00:37,012
- Goddamn right I'm mad.
- You wanted the truth. I got it.

643
01:00:37,221 --> 01:00:39,473
I got the truth.
I got the truth about you.

644
01:00:39,640 --> 01:00:42,559
There's not a goddamn thing
you won't do!

645
01:00:42,726 --> 01:00:45,437
You want me to be the asshole?
Okay. I'm the asshole.

646
01:00:45,604 --> 01:00:46,855
Ben is innocent.

647
01:00:47,064 --> 01:00:50,442
I don't care if you bring 100
Todd Canipes through that door.

648
01:00:50,609 --> 01:00:53,445
Just stay the hell away from me
from now on!

649
01:01:10,963 --> 01:01:12,923
H & R Meats.

650
01:01:13,090 --> 01:01:16,051
- Ben Jordan, please.
- Jordan?

651
01:01:16,218 --> 01:01:18,720
He hasn't been here
in over a week.

652
01:01:22,015 --> 01:01:23,350
Hello?

653
01:01:24,351 --> 01:01:25,686
Hello?

654
01:02:39,510 --> 01:02:40,886
Then...

655
01:02:43,138 --> 01:02:45,182
...that's it, isn't it?

656
01:02:45,974 --> 01:02:47,267
Yeah.

657
01:02:48,936 --> 01:02:52,940
You know, if you don't mind
my saying it, I'm a little surprised.

658
01:02:53,148 --> 01:02:56,235
Didn't you think of using anything?

659
01:02:56,985 --> 01:03:00,322
At that moment
I wasn't thinking at all.

660
01:03:02,074 --> 01:03:04,618
Score one for passion, huh?

661
01:03:21,927 --> 01:03:24,179
Are you all right?

662
01:03:25,472 --> 01:03:26,849
No.

663
01:03:28,058 --> 01:03:29,852
No, I'm not.

664
01:03:50,497 --> 01:03:52,666
This is the residence
of Laura Mathews.

665
01:03:52,833 --> 01:03:55,127
I'm not home,
but if you leave a message...

666
01:03:55,294 --> 01:03:59,006
...I'll return your call right away.
Wait for the beep.

667
01:04:00,215 --> 01:04:02,551
Oh, damn it, Laura!

668
01:04:03,427 --> 01:04:05,888
What the hell's going on?

669
01:04:06,096 --> 01:04:10,184
I know you're there.
Pick up the phone.

670
01:04:12,519 --> 01:04:13,812
Laura?

671
01:04:16,899 --> 01:04:19,234
Call me. Okay?

672
01:04:21,737 --> 01:04:23,197
I miss you.

673
01:04:33,248 --> 01:04:34,583
Laura?

674
01:04:35,834 --> 01:04:37,252
Laura?

675
01:04:37,753 --> 01:04:42,591
Are you there?
Pick up the phone. Please.

676
01:04:50,140 --> 01:04:53,227
- Hello?
- Hi.

677
01:04:54,019 --> 01:04:58,106
I was worried. How have you been?

678
01:04:59,024 --> 01:05:01,109
I've been busy.

679
01:05:02,361 --> 01:05:03,820
Yeah, me too.

680
01:05:03,987 --> 01:05:07,950
Oh, yeah? You been busy at work?

681
01:05:08,492 --> 01:05:11,537
No. Not exactly. I'm just...

682
01:05:14,748 --> 01:05:15,999
Listen...

683
01:05:19,461 --> 01:05:21,713
...I need to talk to you.

684
01:05:22,840 --> 01:05:26,885
Okay. Give me a couple of minutes.
I'll be right there.

685
01:05:27,052 --> 01:05:28,303
No.

686
01:05:29,805 --> 01:05:31,306
Not here.

687
01:06:12,014 --> 01:06:15,601
- Just coffee, thanks.
- The same here.

688
01:06:17,728 --> 01:06:20,314
I'm sorry I lost my job.

689
01:06:20,522 --> 01:06:23,942
I was gonna tell you,
but you didn't give me enough time.

690
01:06:26,195 --> 01:06:28,280
It's not important.

691
01:06:30,741 --> 01:06:33,535
So, what did you
want to talk about?

692
01:06:39,374 --> 01:06:40,709
Laura?

693
01:06:46,006 --> 01:06:47,799
I'm pregnant.

694
01:06:51,011 --> 01:06:53,180
You keeping the baby?

695
01:06:57,726 --> 01:06:59,603
Are you?

696
01:07:02,981 --> 01:07:05,025
I don't know.

697
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:06,735
Why not?

698
01:07:06,902 --> 01:07:09,821
You afraid it's gonna
be a psychopath?

699
01:07:10,656 --> 01:07:13,617
I don't know what I'm afraid of.

700
01:07:14,117 --> 01:07:15,994
You think I killed her.

701
01:07:17,287 --> 01:07:19,790
What changed your mind?

702
01:07:20,123 --> 01:07:21,458
You know what I think?

703
01:07:21,625 --> 01:07:24,795
I think you've been slumming,
and now you're getting scared.

704
01:07:24,962 --> 01:07:28,590
God, are you lucky I didn't get drunk
one night. I could have killed you!

705
01:07:28,799 --> 01:07:30,592
Oh, stop! Please!

706
01:07:32,719 --> 01:07:34,221
Look at me.

707
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:38,308
All right.

708
01:07:38,475 --> 01:07:40,102
I'll stop.

709
01:09:05,103 --> 01:09:06,855
Laura? You all right?

710
01:09:08,815 --> 01:09:12,819
My God! Steve, what are you doing?

711
01:09:15,197 --> 01:09:19,326
I got a little worried when you
didn't answer your phone, so...

712
01:09:21,870 --> 01:09:26,792
So here I am. Good excuse as any for
a little early-morning fishing, I guess.

713
01:09:30,087 --> 01:09:33,549
Think there's ever gonna be
a time when you don't hate me?

714
01:09:34,258 --> 01:09:37,135
Steve, I don't hate you.

715
01:09:40,681 --> 01:09:45,686
It's just that right now,
I'm pretty pissed off at you.

716
01:09:46,645 --> 01:09:51,400
But I'm also kind of spooked,
so I'm glad you're here.

717
01:13:17,064 --> 01:13:19,566
Would it be all right if I talked to...

718
01:13:19,983 --> 01:13:22,903
...Miss Mathews for a second?

719
01:13:28,784 --> 01:13:30,244
Hi.

720
01:13:30,953 --> 01:13:33,956
Miss Mathews, I'm
Detective Allan Tobias.

721
01:13:34,164 --> 01:13:38,252
I know you've been through a lot, so
I'll make this short. I need to ask...

722
01:13:38,794 --> 01:13:43,465
...do you know anyone
who might have reason to...

723
01:13:43,632 --> 01:13:45,843
...kill Steve Lundy?

724
01:13:52,307 --> 01:13:53,600
All right.

725
01:13:53,767 --> 01:13:57,145
We'll try it again. Where were you?

726
01:13:57,938 --> 01:13:59,690
My room.

727
01:13:59,857 --> 01:14:01,817
At the motel?

728
01:14:02,109 --> 01:14:05,112
- Yeah.
- You didn't leave your room all night?

729
01:14:05,279 --> 01:14:06,780
You got it.

730
01:14:06,989 --> 01:14:09,157
What did you do last night?

731
01:14:09,366 --> 01:14:12,995
- I slept.
- How about this morning?

732
01:14:13,203 --> 01:14:15,080
I was still sleeping.

733
01:14:15,247 --> 01:14:16,498
Oh, you slept all night.

734
01:14:16,665 --> 01:14:19,084
Didn't get up to take a piss
or anything, right?

735
01:14:19,251 --> 01:14:20,502
Yeah, once.

736
01:14:20,669 --> 01:14:24,423
I don't suppose you have
any witnesses to that, huh?

737
01:14:24,840 --> 01:14:27,009
I piss alone.

738
01:14:28,635 --> 01:14:31,680
Ben, what'd you think
of Steve Lundy?

739
01:14:35,601 --> 01:14:37,686
I'm gonna miss him.

740
01:15:29,279 --> 01:15:32,115
- Hi.
- Hi.

741
01:15:32,282 --> 01:15:35,327
That was a... That was
a very nice service.

742
01:15:36,495 --> 01:15:39,581
- Jordan was released this morning.
- He was what?

743
01:15:39,748 --> 01:15:44,461
Public defender said that we had to
show cause if we wanted to hold him...

744
01:15:44,628 --> 01:15:46,588
...and well, we didn't have any.

745
01:15:47,881 --> 01:15:50,092
I just thought I'd let you know.

746
01:15:51,051 --> 01:15:52,803
Miss Mathews...

747
01:15:52,970 --> 01:15:55,180
...you don't have anything
to worry about...

748
01:15:55,347 --> 01:15:58,600
...because I have the man
staked out 24 hours a day.

749
01:16:04,398 --> 01:16:07,568
Oh, there's something
else I'd like to ask.

750
01:16:09,027 --> 01:16:13,574
People have been saying that there's
something between you and Jordan.

751
01:16:13,782 --> 01:16:17,286
Now, I know it's none of my business,
but it might help if I knew.

752
01:16:17,578 --> 01:16:19,621
There was something.

753
01:16:49,443 --> 01:16:51,278
Laura!

754
01:16:51,445 --> 01:16:53,071
Would you let me in?

755
01:16:53,280 --> 01:16:54,531
Laura!

756
01:16:54,740 --> 01:16:56,158
No!

757
01:16:56,325 --> 01:16:58,911
Before the cops get here.

758
01:16:59,328 --> 01:17:03,999
Laura, you believed in me.
You were the only one.

759
01:17:04,166 --> 01:17:05,792
Open this damn door!

760
01:17:06,001 --> 01:17:07,711
You stay the hell away from me!

761
01:17:08,378 --> 01:17:10,172
I've got a gun!

762
01:17:24,061 --> 01:17:28,649
It was pouring rain that night.

763
01:17:29,775 --> 01:17:34,988
I'd gotten laid off a week before,
so I was out looking for a job.

764
01:17:35,155 --> 01:17:37,616
Not having any luck.

765
01:17:38,534 --> 01:17:41,870
So I stopped off...

766
01:17:42,037 --> 01:17:44,706
...picked up a couple of six packs...

767
01:17:44,873 --> 01:17:48,961
...and just sat in the car, drinking.

768
01:17:51,046 --> 01:17:53,590
Trying to work things out
in my head.

769
01:17:55,008 --> 01:17:56,802
We were young.

770
01:17:56,969 --> 01:17:59,012
I was thinking...

771
01:18:00,180 --> 01:18:03,600
...maybe I wasn't ready for the baby.

772
01:18:04,852 --> 01:18:07,563
That I'd be a lousy father.

773
01:18:07,729 --> 01:18:11,525
Anyway, I tied one on.

774
01:18:12,609 --> 01:18:15,696
About 11, I figured I'd
better be getting on home...

775
01:18:15,863 --> 01:18:18,615
...while I could still drive.

776
01:18:20,409 --> 01:18:22,244
I found her.

777
01:18:26,081 --> 01:18:28,750
I didn't kill anybody.

778
01:18:29,668 --> 01:18:31,712
I just didn't.

779
01:19:17,257 --> 01:19:20,052
- Hi.
- Hi.

780
01:19:21,261 --> 01:19:23,180
For the baby.

781
01:19:27,893 --> 01:19:30,646
You're a little early, but thanks.

782
01:19:30,812 --> 01:19:33,148
Come on. Let's get out of here.

783
01:19:33,315 --> 01:19:36,610
You go ahead. I'll be a few minutes.

784
01:19:39,029 --> 01:19:42,032
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure.

785
01:19:43,325 --> 01:19:47,663
Why are you having the baby? I mean,
I know it's none of my business.

786
01:19:47,829 --> 01:19:49,498
But why?

787
01:20:01,176 --> 01:20:03,136
Because...

788
01:20:07,140 --> 01:20:10,102
I guess because...

789
01:20:10,894 --> 01:20:13,939
...in the middle of all this death...

790
01:20:15,190 --> 01:20:17,442
...it's a life.

791
01:20:21,989 --> 01:20:24,324
Thanks for the present.

792
01:23:18,498 --> 01:23:20,417
No!

793
01:23:21,251 --> 01:23:22,586
No!

794
01:23:22,961 --> 01:23:27,216
No!

795
01:23:31,386 --> 01:23:35,474
Dogs lost the scent.
We can't see a damn thing.

796
01:23:35,682 --> 01:23:37,809
Nothing so far.

797
01:23:38,769 --> 01:23:41,104
We're gonna call it a night.

798
01:23:41,563 --> 01:23:44,691
Gonna leave a couple of men here.
I think you'll be fine.

799
01:23:44,900 --> 01:23:46,985
- Lf you need me, call me.
- Okay.

800
01:23:47,152 --> 01:23:48,862
- Thanks.
- See you in the morning.

801
01:23:49,029 --> 01:23:50,989
- Good night, boys.
- Good night, sir.

802
01:23:51,156 --> 01:23:55,160
- I'll be in the studio.
- You want one of us to go with you?

803
01:23:55,327 --> 01:23:57,788
I'd rather be alone.

804
01:24:20,102 --> 01:24:22,604
This is the place...

805
01:24:23,647 --> 01:24:26,316
...where I fell in love with you.

806
01:24:29,278 --> 01:24:32,614
- Ben...
- I don't want to hear your voice.

807
01:24:33,282 --> 01:24:37,953
When you turned on me, the
first thing to go was your voice.

808
01:24:38,120 --> 01:24:40,497
You believed in me.

809
01:24:40,664 --> 01:24:42,666
I wonder...

810
01:24:42,875 --> 01:24:44,626
...why did you stop?

811
01:24:47,963 --> 01:24:49,506
Laura...

812
01:24:50,841 --> 01:24:53,635
...when I found my wife...

813
01:24:54,803 --> 01:24:57,931
...she was lying in a pool of blood...

814
01:24:58,432 --> 01:25:01,476
...eyes staring.

815
01:25:01,768 --> 01:25:05,772
God, I remember calling her name...

816
01:25:06,815 --> 01:25:10,777
...sitting there on my knees,
holding her.

817
01:25:11,445 --> 01:25:13,614
The knife...

818
01:25:14,031 --> 01:25:16,617
...was still in her belly.

819
01:25:17,159 --> 01:25:19,661
I had to pull it out.

820
01:25:21,914 --> 01:25:24,249
I just had to.

821
01:25:25,959 --> 01:25:28,170
Nothing else I could do.

822
01:25:40,265 --> 01:25:41,934
Come on.

823
01:26:14,341 --> 01:26:16,718
They got him, huh?

824
01:26:22,057 --> 01:26:23,684
Yeah.

825
01:26:24,226 --> 01:26:25,811
They...

826
01:26:26,019 --> 01:26:27,938
They got him.

827
01:26:31,817 --> 01:26:34,069
What are you doing here?

828
01:26:34,236 --> 01:26:35,779
I was out there with them.

829
01:26:36,196 --> 01:26:38,407
The others left because of the rain...

830
01:26:38,574 --> 01:26:41,410
...but I thought I'd try a little harder.

831
01:26:41,577 --> 01:26:44,121
I'm chilled to the bone.

832
01:26:46,999 --> 01:26:48,750
Could I have a cup of coffee?

833
01:27:16,570 --> 01:27:19,323
- Hello?
- Laura? Tobias.

834
01:27:19,489 --> 01:27:21,325
I'm sorry he got as far as he did...

835
01:27:21,491 --> 01:27:24,369
...but at least we got him
before he could do anything.

836
01:27:24,536 --> 01:27:26,622
- Daddy.
- What?

837
01:27:26,788 --> 01:27:28,790
So glad you called.

838
01:27:28,999 --> 01:27:33,587
All right, I hear you. If you're
in trouble, find a way to say yes.

839
01:27:33,795 --> 01:27:35,964
Yeah, very much.

840
01:27:36,131 --> 01:27:37,591
And I always will.

841
01:27:37,758 --> 01:27:40,093
Hang in there. I mean it, Laura.
Hang in there.

842
01:27:40,260 --> 01:27:41,845
Help's on the way.

843
01:27:42,012 --> 01:27:44,389
I have to go now.

844
01:27:45,599 --> 01:27:47,142
Love you.

845
01:27:50,354 --> 01:27:52,231
My father.

846
01:27:53,106 --> 01:27:54,608
I know.

847
01:27:57,069 --> 01:28:00,614
- Would you like some more coffee?
- No.

848
01:28:01,073 --> 01:28:03,617
Thank you very much.

849
01:28:21,134 --> 01:28:22,636
Please.

850
01:28:23,011 --> 01:28:24,888
No.

851
01:28:25,055 --> 01:28:28,350
Please, please, please.

852
01:28:56,712 --> 01:29:00,007
I got them, Ben! I got both of them!

853
01:29:00,132 --> 01:29:03,969
Now you stay right there.
You'll be safe.

854
01:29:04,136 --> 01:29:06,805
I'm going back in,
and I'm gonna take care of her.

855
01:29:06,972 --> 01:29:09,766
Todd! No!

856
01:29:09,975 --> 01:29:11,935
Christ!

857
01:29:12,853 --> 01:29:14,730
Laura!

858
01:29:55,771 --> 01:29:59,191
You should have blown
his head off like I said...

859
01:29:59,358 --> 01:30:01,360
...and we could have
avoided all this.

860
01:30:10,536 --> 01:30:12,412
Laura!

861
01:30:18,335 --> 01:30:21,380
Help me! Help me!

862
01:30:21,964 --> 01:30:25,509
Ben! Help me!

863
01:31:04,506 --> 01:31:06,717
Turn it on.

864
01:31:08,177 --> 01:31:10,429
Turn it on.

865
01:31:17,019 --> 01:31:20,856
Look at her. Look at her!

866
01:31:25,986 --> 01:31:28,822
She offered me a drink
and everything.

867
01:31:29,823 --> 01:31:33,285
Why not? I'm Ben's buddy.

868
01:31:57,351 --> 01:31:59,520
Ben came home...

869
01:32:00,020 --> 01:32:02,689
...30 minutes after I killed her.

870
01:32:02,898 --> 01:32:04,858
I just hid in the bedroom.

871
01:32:05,567 --> 01:32:08,028
He came in,
he saw her on the floor...

872
01:32:08,195 --> 01:32:10,364
...and he ran out.

873
01:32:16,453 --> 01:32:18,539
Poor Ben.

874
01:32:18,956 --> 01:32:20,958
Poor Kathy.

875
01:32:35,931 --> 01:32:38,559
There were others before her.

876
01:32:39,351 --> 01:32:42,062
And they all had these bellies.

877
01:32:42,229 --> 01:32:45,941
These big, round bellies.

878
01:32:47,526 --> 01:32:49,486
But don't misjudge me.

879
01:32:50,237 --> 01:32:52,906
I'm not a sex maniac.

880
01:32:53,156 --> 01:32:56,660
I'm not some Son of Sam asshole.

881
01:32:59,663 --> 01:33:00,831
I don't hear voices.

882
01:33:03,083 --> 01:33:05,085
It's not like I have to...

883
01:33:05,294 --> 01:33:07,546
...kill somebody every week.

884
01:33:25,480 --> 01:33:28,650
The first time Mama
made me put it in her...

885
01:33:29,234 --> 01:33:31,528
...I felt sick.

886
01:33:33,614 --> 01:33:36,325
Then as her belly swelled...

887
01:33:36,658 --> 01:33:39,661
...and she climbed on top of me...

888
01:33:40,621 --> 01:33:43,332
...it got so I couldn't breathe.

889
01:33:45,375 --> 01:33:47,377
I held my breath...

890
01:33:47,920 --> 01:33:50,297
...till she went away again...

891
01:33:50,923 --> 01:33:53,342
...and left me alone.

892
01:35:07,791 --> 01:35:10,085
No!
