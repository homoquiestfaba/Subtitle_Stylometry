- Hey, Arjun?
- Yes.

67
00:04:48,751 --> 00:04:51,003
I replied to your soleca
post for the rental.

68
00:04:51,053 --> 00:04:51,836
Arnab, right?

69
00:04:51,886 --> 00:04:53,170
- Yes.
- Hey, Arnab.

70
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,970
Did you have any problem
finding the house?

71
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,950
No, GPS got me right directly here.

72
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,350
Okay, wonderful, come on.

73
00:05:02,608 --> 00:05:04,210
(door squeaks)

74
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:05,710
Hey, good morning.

75
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,117
Yes, right and so yesterday

76
00:05:08,167 --> 00:05:11,710
all the pending tickets
that we had were resolved

77
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,173
and I sent them for testing.

78
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:17,260
Yes, I did clear that pending tickets.

79
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:22,310
So today's agenda will be going
through the phase two plan,

80
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,483
and I'll be developing that portfolio.

81
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,873
I do not see any risks or issues today.

82
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:30,460
Mm hmm.

83
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,007
Okay.

84
00:05:33,057 --> 00:05:37,219
(keyboard keys clacking)

85
00:05:37,269 --> 00:05:39,936
(sound from TV)

86
00:05:44,007 --> 00:05:45,007
- Hey, Arjun
- Hey.

87
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:47,080
How are you doing?

88
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:48,330
I'm good, how are you?

89
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:49,163
Good.

90
00:05:49,213 --> 00:05:50,260
So all set?

91
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:52,030
Yeah, I'm slowly settling down.

92
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,080
Yes.

93
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,570
If you need anything let me know, okay.

94
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:56,620
Sure, sure.

95
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:00,100
What are you watching?

96
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:02,943
Some Netflix, thought
to watch some Indian.

97
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:06,040
Do you have any preference?

98
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:08,733
No, I like Indian movies, we can watch.

99
00:06:09,804 --> 00:06:11,860
Did you start your job yet?

100
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:15,280
No, I took a week off, slowly
getting to know the place.

101
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:16,486
Probably I'll start next week.

102
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:18,850
- Okay.
- I'll start from Monday.

103
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:19,930
Oh, cool.

104
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:20,980
Nice.

105
00:06:27,432 --> 00:06:28,215
Arjun.

106
00:06:28,265 --> 00:06:29,048
[Arjun] Hello.

107
00:06:29,098 --> 00:06:29,881
Guess what?

108
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:30,714
What happened?

109
00:06:30,764 --> 00:06:31,764
We got the visa.

110
00:06:33,323 --> 00:06:35,260
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

111
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:36,730
Isn't that exciting?

112
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:38,230
I'm so excited.

113
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,120
Can you now hurry up and
book our flights so...

114
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:41,320
We really wanna go there.

115
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:43,090
Mm hmm, yeah.

116
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:44,050
I'm so happy.

117
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,700
Thank you so much.

118
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,283
Both of you, right?

119
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:48,333
Yes.

120
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:50,890
Okay.

121
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:51,970
No, no, not this week,

122
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:52,900
I have to go shopping first.

123
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:54,219
Next week?

124
00:06:54,269 --> 00:06:55,052
I'm so happy.

125
00:06:55,102 --> 00:06:57,190
Also so I'm gonna go
start fixing the house.

126
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,480
You start packing okay.

127
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:00,033
I'll see you soon, right.

128
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:03,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I, I'll do it.

129
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:04,273
Okay.

130
00:07:04,323 --> 00:07:05,526
I'm so excited.
Okay, I have to go.

131
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,887
I have to so many things, okay, bye, bye.

132
00:07:09,464 --> 00:07:12,631
(gentle upbeat music)

133
00:07:20,578 --> 00:07:24,573
Hey Arjun, thank you for
the coffee, it's very tasty.

134
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:27,580
By the way, this house looks so beautiful.

135
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:28,650
Do you own this house?

136
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:31,323
Oh no, no, I wish, I wish, I wish.

137
00:07:32,918 --> 00:07:35,080
I actually got a really
good deal on Craiglist.

138
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:37,630
The owner of this house, this American guy

139
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,020
wanted to, you know, go to
California for 15 months.

140
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:41,730
So I got it for half price.

141
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:43,540
Wow.

142
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:46,960
You know I mentioned my
wife is coming in two months,

143
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:50,449
so, that time you have to vacate my house.

144
00:07:50,499 --> 00:07:51,342
Sure.

145
00:07:51,392 --> 00:07:52,175
Not a problem.

146
00:07:52,225 --> 00:07:53,225
Thank you.

147
00:07:56,568 --> 00:07:59,318
(dramatic music)

148
00:08:46,053 --> 00:08:49,136
(car engine revving)

149
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,491
- Hey, Arjun.
- Hey.

150
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:55,206
Did you smoke?

151
00:08:55,256 --> 00:08:56,780
Yeah, how do you know?

152
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:58,000
Am I smelling?

153
00:08:58,050 --> 00:08:59,020
No, you're not.

154
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:02,513
Usually you drink coffee
after having a smoke, right?

155
00:09:02,563 --> 00:09:03,346
I got used to it.

156
00:09:03,396 --> 00:09:05,980
Man, you caught me, huh?

157
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:07,263
Yep, yep.

158
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:09,250
Cool.

159
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:12,490
Yeah, by the way, I want to
share with you a good news.

160
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:13,510
Yeah?

161
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:17,110
We are going to buy a house
nearby, so I might move soon.

162
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:17,990
Oh really?

163
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,419
Is it the next block
one you were looking at?

164
00:09:19,443 --> 00:09:22,390
- Yes, yes.
- Oh man, congratulations.

165
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,740
Thank you, thank you.

166
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:25,990
That's not the good news for me though.

167
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,370
No problem, man.

168
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:29,080
I'm not going anywhere far.

169
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:31,198
You're still going to be
in touch, don't worry.

170
00:09:31,248 --> 00:09:33,670
So your family, I know
your family is coming,

171
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,070
but your parents also moving?

172
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:40,353
No, we are a family of four,
me, my wife and two boys.

173
00:09:40,403 --> 00:09:42,977
Yeah, yeah, of course,
come on, I know that.

174
00:09:43,027 --> 00:09:44,950
I know, I was asking if parents too.

175
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,800
No, my dad and my mom,

176
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:50,110
they're back in India with my brother.

177
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,980
My dad is a businessman, does real estate,

178
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:56,230
builds and sells houses.

179
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,490
That's what he does.

180
00:09:58,738 --> 00:10:00,155
So how about you?

181
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:03,880
My dad is a clerk in private school

182
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:07,180
and my mom is a housewife,

183
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:09,813
planning the wedding for my sister.

184
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:11,710
- [Arnab] Yeah?
- Big things coming up.

185
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,760
So...

186
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,970
Nothing much.

187
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:18,693
But my wife's side is pretty rich though.

188
00:10:19,599 --> 00:10:21,055
Oh, interesting.

189
00:10:21,105 --> 00:10:21,888
(Arjun laughing)

190
00:10:21,938 --> 00:10:23,830
Clever boy and you got a lottery.

191
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,680
No, no, no, no.

192
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:27,700
You can say it's lottery, but yeah,

193
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:30,630
it's my father-in-law.

194
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,893
He really liked me.

195
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,343
He's my mentor.

196
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:38,080
He just gave me his daughter.

197
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:40,750
He says he sees potential in me.

198
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,932
I don't know what potential
he's talking about.

199
00:10:42,982 --> 00:10:44,410
(both laughing)

200
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:49,460
But he's like my mentor
and, but I respect that man.

201
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:52,810
And he's my father-in-law,

202
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,280
and my mentor.

203
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:56,294
Man, lucky you.

204
00:10:56,344 --> 00:10:57,127
Thank you.

205
00:10:57,177 --> 00:10:58,960
Oh, actually we need to celebrate

206
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:00,170
your house warming stuff huh?

207
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:01,690
Sure, definitely.

208
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:05,140
So where are we having dinner today?

209
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:06,400
What would you prefer?

210
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:07,544
What will we have?
Let's go, let's go.

211
00:11:07,568 --> 00:11:09,077
Come we'll discuss while going on.

212
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:10,754
[Arjun] Yeah.

213
00:11:10,804 --> 00:11:11,804
♪ Yeah you better ♪

214
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:15,160
Man, this work never ends.

215
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:16,510
How about you?

216
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,343
Yeah, fine.

217
00:11:17,393 --> 00:11:18,393
What happened?

218
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:22,090
For some reason my code gets hung.

219
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,283
I don't see any issue.

220
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:24,933
Ah, okay.

221
00:11:24,983 --> 00:11:27,010
You know what, let's do one thing.

222
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:29,380
Press control, alt, delete.
[Arnab] Okay?

223
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:30,388
And reboot.

224
00:11:30,438 --> 00:11:31,438
(Arjun laughing)
What?

225
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:34,390
Come on, stop kidding.

226
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,010
It's not the issue with laptop right,

227
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,810
it's an issue with the code.

228
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:38,860
Mm...

229
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:42,640
Okay, try to run the code one more time

230
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:45,040
and let's see what do you get now.

231
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:46,653
Okay, I'll try.

232
00:11:51,574 --> 00:11:54,790
(birds chirping)

233
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,410
Hey, always working.

234
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:57,612
Come, let's go out.

235
00:11:57,662 --> 00:11:58,445
Come.

236
00:11:58,495 --> 00:11:59,662
(chuckles)

237
00:11:59,712 --> 00:12:00,712
Okay.

238
00:12:01,856 --> 00:12:04,523
(melodic music)

239
00:12:25,357 --> 00:12:28,357
(keyboard clacking)

240
00:12:34,325 --> 00:12:35,892
Hey Arjun, beer?

241
00:12:35,942 --> 00:12:39,065
Yeah, sure.

242
00:12:39,115 --> 00:12:40,115
Let's go.

243
00:12:40,921 --> 00:12:42,055
Yeah, coming.

244
00:12:42,105 --> 00:12:43,263
(upbeat music)

245
00:12:43,313 --> 00:12:44,646
Cheers.
Cheers.

246
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,720
Hey, Arjun.

247
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:03,820
Hey Arnab.

248
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:05,830
I'm taking a move now,

249
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,420
movers did a good job.

250
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:10,863
All of my stuff is already
moved, so here is the key.

251
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,030
No, you keep the key.

252
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,317
You can come anytime.

253
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:15,150
No, no, no.

254
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:19,750
I'll take the key for your
own house, so keep this.

255
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,790
Along with that, I have one more key.

256
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,310
So I have a car and my wife,

257
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,610
she got a new one recently.
[Arjun] Oh.

258
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:29,560
So we have two cars
and this is an extra car.

259
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:31,690
So I keep your driving Toyota.

260
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,730
So this will not cut before babi.

261
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:35,680
So I know she's coming from India.

262
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:38,890
Keep this Audi car, and drive
it till you buy a new one.

263
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:40,595
Okay?
[Arjun] Man.

264
00:13:40,645 --> 00:13:41,770
(both laugh)

265
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,120
[Arnab] Cool.

266
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:44,440
But you can sell it, right?

267
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,480
We will sell it, once you get a new one.

268
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:48,730
Good car, we will definitely sell it.

269
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:49,563
[Arjun] Mm.

270
00:13:49,613 --> 00:13:51,220
So please keep in touch and come home

271
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:52,510
with your whole family.

272
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,770
Of course, of course.

273
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:55,570
Now I own your car.

274
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:56,590
(both laughing)
No problem.

275
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,630
Oh, actually, before you leave,

276
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:01,060
I know you love this Krishna, right?

277
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:01,893
- Yes sir.
- Why don't you

278
00:14:01,943 --> 00:14:03,006
take it while you're going.

279
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:03,813
Cool, thank you.

280
00:14:03,863 --> 00:14:05,590
I'll take it on my way, bye.
[Arjun] Okay.

281
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,490
[Arnab] See you.

282
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:07,903
All the best.

283
00:14:07,953 --> 00:14:11,536
(airplane engine whirring)

284
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:22,567
(tranquil music)

285
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:30,123
- Hey, I missed you.
- Mm, I missed you too.

286
00:14:33,274 --> 00:14:35,392
- [Arjun] Tired?
- Tired, yeah.

287
00:14:35,442 --> 00:14:37,540
All right, how is your life going?

288
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:38,950
How's my princess?

289
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:39,940
She's sleeping, right?

290
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:41,553
Yes, I have put her to bed.

291
00:14:43,796 --> 00:14:44,903
I missed you.

292
00:14:44,953 --> 00:14:46,603
I missed you too.

293
00:14:46,653 --> 00:14:48,880
Miss my parents already.

294
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:52,510
But, they're happy I'm
here, especially my dad.

295
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,976
Because he knows that you're going to take

296
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:54,783
care of me.

297
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:55,616
Of course.

298
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:57,003
So he's excited.

299
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:00,700
Your, your parents are doing good.

300
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:03,520
They're busy planning
your sister's wedding.

301
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:04,750
But everyone is fine.

302
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,453
I'm gonna miss them already.

303
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,610
Miss them, but you didn't miss me?

304
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,283
I missed you too, of course.

305
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:13,685
I missed you more.

306
00:15:13,735 --> 00:15:15,340
Oh, it's so good.

307
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:17,440
House looks good.
[Arjun] Thank you.

308
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:19,660
Yeah, how is work by the way?

309
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:22,030
- Work is good, uh...
- Yeah?

310
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:24,610
Trying really hard to make them happy.

311
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:27,700
Keep them happy so that they
can, of course, you know,

312
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:30,640
to extend my contract, hedge
fund and everything else.

313
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:31,960
They will.

314
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:33,430
Hope so.

315
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:37,390
But I've been working on
something of my own as well.

316
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,290
Really?

317
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:40,300
Mm hmm uh...

318
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:43,060
Talked to your dad also,
because he's my mentor, right?

319
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:46,270
So he's happy.
Uh huh.

320
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,440
So what is it, tell me?

321
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:49,390
It's a surprise, I'll tell you.

322
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,950
I want to know.

323
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,930
Fine, I'll tell you.

324
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:56,590
Basically I'm working on
a software application for

325
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,320
finances.
Mm.

326
00:15:58,370 --> 00:15:59,943
Uh...

327
00:15:59,993 --> 00:16:04,360
According to your dad and
a couple of his friends,

328
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:07,263
they think if it really
works out the plan,

329
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:09,970
it'll go really big.

330
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:12,130
Oh, how big?

331
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,682
In millions.

332
00:16:13,732 --> 00:16:15,400
No way.

333
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:17,600
I mean, I'm saying, I just don't know.

334
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:18,433
A lot okay.

335
00:16:18,483 --> 00:16:19,990
You know what that means, right?

336
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,146
That means we are going to go
to Disney World because she

337
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:24,303
wants to go really bad, so do I.

338
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,000
And California, because I
got a lot of friends there

339
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:29,560
and they're expecting me.

340
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:31,510
That means we are going
to get a bigger house,

341
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,670
like much bigger than this.

342
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,890
And brand new car for me.

343
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:37,630
Of course, nice car check.

344
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,350
Bigger house check, Orlando
Florida, Disneyland, all check.

345
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,600
Of course, for my princess.

346
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:46,630
But friends... I mean,
where is time for me?

347
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,040
I think there's nothing for me.

348
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,968
You can come too, of course.

349
00:16:50,018 --> 00:16:51,410
You can hang out with us.

350
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:53,013
We'll do another honeymoon.

351
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,872
Anyway...
I missed you.

352
00:16:55,922 --> 00:16:57,172
I missed you.

353
00:17:01,111 --> 00:17:03,861
(tranquil music)

354
00:17:12,323 --> 00:17:13,323
All good?

355
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:16,160
What are you thinking?

356
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:18,730
I don't know.

357
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:23,143
Expecting something bigger, more fancy.

358
00:17:23,193 --> 00:17:24,430
Oh.

359
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,380
Definitely not what I was expecting.

360
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:29,620
It's not the bad.

361
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,183
When are we going to
have our own house, hmm?

362
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,904
I don't know, I'm working on something.

363
00:17:36,954 --> 00:17:38,133
Oh... How long then?

364
00:17:40,266 --> 00:17:41,624
Very soon.

365
00:17:41,674 --> 00:17:42,674
Hmm.

366
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:44,800
Okay.

367
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:46,300
We'll figure out something.

368
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:48,480
Just gimme some time.

369
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,040
Okay.

370
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:53,110
Hey, it's nice on the other side too.

371
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,480
Let me show you, okay?

372
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:56,779
- Okay.
- Come.

373
00:17:56,829 --> 00:17:59,202
(keys beeping)

374
00:17:59,252 --> 00:18:00,558
(phone ringing)

375
00:18:00,608 --> 00:18:02,710
Hi Shweta.

376
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,023
Yes, I'm here.

377
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:08,140
It's okay, it's a nice house,

378
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:11,290
but we won't be here for long.

379
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:14,200
No, we are getting a bigger house.

380
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:17,560
No, he's getting me a $5 million house.

381
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:19,110
Yeah, mm hmm.

382
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,640
Yes, he has that kind of money.

383
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:23,650
And also he's going to buy me a Tesla.

384
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,653
So I'm really excited about that.

385
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:28,293
Yeah, I know.

386
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:30,380
Anyways...

387
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,240
I'm just arrived and I'm not
sure when I'm able to go to

388
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:35,170
California to see you.

389
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:39,880
But, I'll definitely plan it
so we can be there soon, okay?

390
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:41,740
But, but, but maybe next month.

391
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:42,910
I'll let you know okay?

392
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,710
I'll keep you posted.

393
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,683
Alright, that's it bye.

394
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:52,430
- [Arjun] Hi babe.
- Hi.

395
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:55,420
How did you like it?

396
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:56,470
It's okay.

397
00:18:57,594 --> 00:18:59,770
(foreign language) please.

398
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:01,383
Really, what do you expect?

399
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:04,879
Can you make some food please?

400
00:19:04,929 --> 00:19:05,938
Cook?

401
00:19:05,988 --> 00:19:07,071
I don't cook.

402
00:19:08,128 --> 00:19:10,930
I know, but we don't have maids here

403
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:13,720
and we have to do everything on ourselves.

404
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:15,610
So I have to cook every day?

405
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:18,220
Listen, I just finished
washing the clothes.

406
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:21,993
If you can help cook
food, if you can please?

407
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:26,842
I guess, what do you wanna eat?

408
00:19:26,892 --> 00:19:28,142
Dal and rice,

409
00:19:29,214 --> 00:19:30,160
hmm?

410
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,480
Okay.

411
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:32,313
Thank you.

412
00:19:32,363 --> 00:19:33,980
- I guess I'll cook.
- Thank you.

413
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:41,710
Guess what days today?

414
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,270

- Yeah.

415
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:46,000
So can we get some food?

416
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:47,091
What would you like to have?

417
00:19:47,115 --> 00:19:48,550
Anything.

418
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,360
Okay, um...

You know what, let's go.

420
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:55,630
Let's go outside.

421
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,940
No, I wanna stay here
just order some food for us,

422
00:19:57,990 --> 00:19:58,773

423
00:19:58,823 --> 00:20:00,010
Uh, okay.

424
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:01,583

428
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:08,853

(fast paced music)

431
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:36,133
[Caller] Hey Arjun,

432
00:20:36,183 --> 00:20:38,163

Yes, thank you sir.

433
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:40,794
Thank you.
[Caller] That's great.

00:20:40,844 --> 00:20:44,430
So you know the deliverables

00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,060
So can you get to send that today?

No and...

438
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:52,840
I had plans with my family, it's weekend.

00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:55,173
So can I send it to you on Monday?

440
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:57,490
[Caller] Arjun I understand.

441
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:59,406
But you know how many
people are waiting for this

442
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:01,720

Yes sir.

443
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:02,553
[Caller] Right?

444
00:21:02,603 --> 00:21:03,490
You got a good platform, man.

445
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:04,483
You gotta use it.
Yes sir.

446
00:21:04,533 --> 00:21:06,820
[Caller] Just cover it man.

447
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:09,130
Just finish it off, right?

448
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:11,680
Let's have that finished today, okay?

449
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:12,730
No problem, sir.

450
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:14,620
I'm getting started, right?

451
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:16,245
You'll have it by today.

452
00:21:16,295 --> 00:21:17,078
[Caller] That's perfect,

00:21:17,128 --> 00:21:17,911

Yes sir.

454
00:21:17,961 --> 00:21:18,961
[Caller] All right.

455
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:20,800
Bye.

456
00:21:21,825 --> 00:21:23,825
(sighs)

457
00:21:27,417 --> 00:21:28,417
Okay.

458
00:21:29,973 --> 00:21:30,973
Arjun...

459
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:34,690
- Hi babe.
- Hi.

460
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:36,070
Wow, you look amazing.

461
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:36,903
Thank you.

462
00:21:36,953 --> 00:21:39,130
Are you ready?

463
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:42,070
Sorry, I have still so much work to do.

464
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:42,903
What do you mean?

465
00:21:42,953 --> 00:21:44,770
You promise you're going
to take me out today,

466
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:46,630
to go eat, it's Friday.

467
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,460
I know, my boss called me and he said

468
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:51,550
something urgent so I have
to finish on something.

469
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,500
I bought all these pretty dresses

470
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:55,263
so that you can take me out.

471
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:57,790
Tomorrow, promise.

472
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,793
No, I wanna go today.

473
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:02,470
How about this?

474
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:05,080
Bring some dinner today, finish the job,

475
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:06,753
and then we'll watch Netflix.

476
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,270
Promise I'll take you tomorrow.

477
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,973
Whatever, it's up to you.

478
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:17,770
(slow somber music)

479
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,223
Dad I'm bored.

480
00:22:26,273 --> 00:22:28,300
Can I watch YouTube videos?
Hey...

481
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:31,180
You, you can watch on TV, right?

482
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:33,147
No, I wanna sit with you.

483
00:22:33,197 --> 00:22:34,697
Okay, come come.

484
00:22:36,858 --> 00:22:37,941
Okay right...

485
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:39,910
This one?

486
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:40,960
Yeah.

487
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:43,283
Thank you dad.

488
00:22:43,333 --> 00:22:45,243
You're welcome.

489
00:22:45,293 --> 00:22:48,696
(cartoon music)

490
00:22:48,746 --> 00:22:51,163
(both laugh)

491
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:56,620
(comical screaming)

492
00:23:02,666 --> 00:23:07,666
(tranquil music)
(birds chirping)

493
00:23:14,384 --> 00:23:15,384
Thank you.

494
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:27,880
So yesterday I finished
this development and

495
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:30,220
looking like we're interested.

496
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:32,073
The screen I'm sharing, yes.

497
00:23:34,233 --> 00:23:35,233
Nice.

498
00:23:36,266 --> 00:23:37,900
Thank you. (whispering)

499
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:40,120
Yeah, so if you click on the right side,

500
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:43,670
you see there is a security uh...

501
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:50,770
Can't believe I'm doing all this.

502
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:53,710
Used to be happy in India,
have maids, have everything.

503
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,030
Now look at me.

504
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:57,624
Why did I marry this guy?

505
00:23:57,674 --> 00:23:59,590
Oh, we need to find some maid.

506
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,480
I can't do this, my God.

507
00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:02,530
Look at this...

508
00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:04,773
So miserable.

509
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:10,773
I can't do this.

510
00:24:12,749 --> 00:24:14,082
I can't do this.

511
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:23,500
That was fun, right?
Yeah.

512
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,800
- So tired.
- [Arjun] Had a good time?

513
00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:28,270
Yes dad.

514
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,130
- Did you see that house?
- [Arjun] Uh huh.

515
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:32,380
Wasn't that big?
[Child] Yeah.

516
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:34,389
We want a house like that.

517
00:24:34,439 --> 00:24:35,736
(Arjun whimpers)
We need a house like that.

518
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,570
We need something bigger.

519
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:41,110
She needs a bigger room,
I need a bigger closet.

520
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,610
When is that going to happen?

521
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:46,960
Soon sometime.

522
00:24:47,010 --> 00:24:48,010
Soon, when?

523
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:50,230
I'm tired of renting this place.

524
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,363
So small.

525
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:57,430
I'm working on it.

526
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,743
You're working on it?

527
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,020
Can't you see all the cars they had?

528
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:05,080
Her jewelry, isn't it pretty?
[Child] Yeah.

529
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:06,850
You see, we want that.

530
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:08,625
We deserve that.

531
00:25:08,675 --> 00:25:10,900
Babe you are already so beautiful.

532
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:12,546
You, you were the most
beautiful in the party.

533
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:14,980
No, I, you know...

534
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:16,033
I don't even know why I bother, you,

535
00:25:16,057 --> 00:25:18,460
you don't understand us.

536
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:20,043
Going to sleep, goodnight.

537
00:25:24,775 --> 00:25:25,980
You okay?

538
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:27,030
Yeah.

539
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:30,397
You had something in the party?

540
00:25:30,447 --> 00:25:31,447
Hmm, yeah.

541
00:25:37,452 --> 00:25:40,103
You are my biggest treasure.

542
00:25:40,153 --> 00:25:41,495
You watch something?

543
00:25:41,545 --> 00:25:42,419
Yeah.

544
00:25:42,469 --> 00:25:44,885
Okay, let's do that.

545
00:25:44,935 --> 00:25:47,852
(slow tense music)

546
00:25:59,994 --> 00:26:00,836
Wow.

547
00:26:00,886 --> 00:26:03,471
Oh my gosh, looks beautiful.

548
00:26:03,521 --> 00:26:04,938
Looks good on me.

549
00:26:17,231 --> 00:26:18,231
Wow,

550
00:26:20,352 --> 00:26:21,352
I need that.

551
00:26:48,176 --> 00:26:50,843
(phone ringing)

552
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,320
Hello?

553
00:26:56,370 --> 00:26:58,270
Hi, can I speak to Arjun?

554
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,500
Yes, speaking.

555
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:02,410
Hi, this is Pushyami calling
you from your HR department.

556
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:04,059
Is this a good time to talk to you?

557
00:27:04,109 --> 00:27:05,110
Oh, yes ma'am.

558
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:07,480
I'm very sorry to inform
you that your contract will be

559
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:09,430
terminated by this month end Arjun.

560
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,050
What?

561
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:13,060
Due to ongoing budget cuts.

562
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:14,110
But why?

563
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:18,520
I've been working so
hard every day, you know?

564
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:19,660
Even on weekends.

565
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:21,220
No, we certainly understand,

566
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:23,230
this is not about your performance,

567
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:25,180
but I know this is all about the program

568
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:27,130
and budget related issues.

569
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:29,655
But I just, listen...

570
00:27:29,705 --> 00:27:30,773
Who can I talk to?

571
00:27:30,823 --> 00:27:33,580
Certainly, I mean this
has come from the program,

572
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:36,610
so you can feel free to
talk to the program manager,

573
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:39,040
but you will probably hear the same thing.

574
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:42,790
Listen to me, I just
had my family here...

575
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,950
And, they just moved.

576
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,870
I do understand.

577
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:47,920
What do you mean?

578
00:27:50,221 --> 00:27:52,000
(foreign language)

579
00:27:52,050 --> 00:27:53,890
I'm very sorry to say that.

580
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:57,220
I do understand that you are upset Arjun,

581
00:27:57,270 --> 00:28:00,163
but this is the situation.

582
00:28:00,213 --> 00:28:01,803
Have a nice day, thank you.

583
00:28:28,659 --> 00:28:30,220
- Hi
- [Arjun] Monica.

584
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:31,270
Hmm?

585
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:34,750
What happened?

586
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:37,408
I lost the job.

587
00:28:37,458 --> 00:28:39,055
What?

588
00:28:39,105 --> 00:28:40,514
How?

589
00:28:40,564 --> 00:28:43,699
I don't know why, they
said they got budget cutting,

590
00:28:43,749 --> 00:28:46,891
so they can't keep me anymore.

591
00:28:46,941 --> 00:28:48,024
Oh my gosh.

592
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:50,370
What are we going to do?

593
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:55,313
I think you and Naya
have to go back home.

594
00:28:55,363 --> 00:28:57,250
No, we are not going back to India.

595
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:58,300
We just got here.

596
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:01,750
See, I know, but I can't manage it.

597
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,160
Yeah, no, that's not happening.

598
00:29:03,210 --> 00:29:04,570
You have to figure it out.

599
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:06,670
Listen, it's just a matter of few days.

600
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,850
I'll figure out something
just, just for few days.

601
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:10,900
No.

602
00:29:12,221 --> 00:29:14,170
I can't believe you lost your job.

603
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:15,250
I didn't lose the job.

604
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:17,673
They said they can't keep me on this job.

605
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:19,960
That's going to be your problem.

606
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:22,110
We are staying here and you figure it out.

607
00:29:34,727 --> 00:29:37,644
(slow tense music)

608
00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:43,010
(keyboard clacking)

609
00:29:49,964 --> 00:29:52,631
(phone ringing)

610
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:03,903
Hello Arjun?

611
00:30:03,953 --> 00:30:05,500
Hello sir?

612
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:06,333
Yeah, tell me.

613
00:30:06,383 --> 00:30:10,120
No, I, I just wanted
to say I lost the job.

614
00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:11,770
Okay, no problem.

615
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:15,220
You send your resume to me,
that happened, don't worry.

616
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:16,810
I'll speak to your marketing team.

617
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:17,643
Okay?

618
00:30:17,693 --> 00:30:19,000
I, sure sir.

619
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:19,958
I'll send my resume.

620
00:30:20,008 --> 00:30:21,611
Thank you so much, thank you.

621
00:30:21,661 --> 00:30:22,661
Okay, bye.

database management, data administration

649
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:04,683

Thank you.

651
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:15,670
Okay.

652
00:32:17,850 --> 00:32:18,910
So what happened?

653
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,627
Did you get it?
No.

654
00:32:24,813 --> 00:32:25,813
It's okay.

655
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,430
I dunno what's wrong with me, just...

656
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:35,980
It's okay.

657
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:37,203
Coming more right?

658
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:40,280
One, next one is tomorrow.

659
00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:45,330
Okay.

660
00:32:46,922 --> 00:32:51,922
We'll get through, I got you.

661
00:33:00,722 --> 00:33:03,389
(phone ringing)

662
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,183
Hello sir.

663
00:33:15,233 --> 00:33:16,960
Hey my friend.

664
00:33:17,010 --> 00:33:18,100
How are you today?

665
00:33:18,150 --> 00:33:19,450
I'm good.

666
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,190
I'm pretty fine, thank you so much.

667
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,450
Hey.

668
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,796
Hey, you've been doing good paying me,

669
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:26,260
but you're behind this month.

670
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:27,490
I need that money.

671
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:29,740
Yeah, I know uh...

672
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:32,740
I haven't sent it, but...

673
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:34,840
When can you get it to me?

674
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:35,673
Within 10 days,

675
00:33:35,723 --> 00:33:38,050
I will definitely send it to you.

676
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:40,450
All right, I'm relying on you.

677
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:41,680
Yes, by Friday.

678
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:42,670
Yes, of course.

679
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,103
Few more days, thank you.

680
00:33:45,330 --> 00:33:46,330
Thank you.

681
00:33:57,267 --> 00:34:00,250
(phone ringing)

682
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:01,180
Hello?

683
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:03,970
[Caller] Hello, am I
speaking to Arjun Matta?

684
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:04,990
Yes, speaking.

685
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:07,660
[Caller] Congratulations,
you have been shortlisted,

686
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:10,270
but the position requires the
candidate to have either green

687
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,820
card or US citizenship.

688
00:34:12,870 --> 00:34:14,470
We hope you have either of them.

689
00:34:18,644 --> 00:34:20,050
No, I'm sorry.

690
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:23,163
I'm not a US citizen nor
do I have a green card.

691
00:34:29,201 --> 00:34:30,201
Okay.

692
00:34:33,411 --> 00:34:36,078
(sound from TV)

693
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:43,510
Hi baby.
[Monica] Hi babe.

694
00:34:49,290 --> 00:34:50,290
What's wrong?

695
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:52,173
No, it didn't work.

696
00:34:54,870 --> 00:34:57,700
They said they can't sponsor
me and since they can't sponsor

697
00:34:57,750 --> 00:34:59,980
me, they don't...

698
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:01,720
They don't have job for me.

699
00:35:01,770 --> 00:35:03,850
Oh, it's okay.

700
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:06,153
Don't you have other jobs lined up,

701
00:35:07,074 --> 00:35:08,830
other interviews?
I don't know.

702
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:11,590
I'm running out of options
and I'm trying to apply.

703
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:12,640
This was big one.

704
00:35:13,590 --> 00:35:15,460
It's okay, it's okay.

705
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:16,293
You're fine.

706
00:35:16,343 --> 00:35:17,260
And we are fine, okay?

707
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:18,483
It's going to be fine.

708
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:22,780
Just you gotta keep
pushing and keep up, fine.

709
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:24,250
We'll be fine, right?

710
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:25,300
Yeah.

711
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:27,250
It will be fine.

712
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:28,450
Yeah, it's fine.

713
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:30,880
Just relax, do you want some chips?

714
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:33,010
- No, I want you.
- [Monica] No, okay?

715
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:33,843
Now just lie down.

716
00:35:33,893 --> 00:35:37,450
Relax, relax and then tomorrow
we look at other options.

717
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:38,960
But we gonna be fine...

718
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:41,013
Right?

719
00:35:41,063 --> 00:35:41,846
With you, of course.

720
00:35:41,896 --> 00:35:42,933
I think we are.

721
00:35:44,149 --> 00:35:46,816
(sound from TV)

722
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:50,650
What are we watching?

723
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:52,510
I don't know, it's a new show.

724
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,723
Never watched, but it's good.

725
00:35:55,604 --> 00:35:56,604
Okay.

726
00:36:14,355 --> 00:36:17,272
(foreboding score)

727
00:36:21,810 --> 00:36:22,960
Hi sir, how are you?

728
00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:24,063
Hi, very good.

729
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:27,070
Can I get one butter chicken?

730
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:29,470
Butter chicken, spicy or normal?

731
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,090
Uh, spicy.

732
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:32,140
Okay, then.

733
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:35,050
[Arjun] One tandoori chicken.

734
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:36,153
You want spicy?

735
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,560
Of course.

736
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:39,610
Uh...

737
00:36:43,050 --> 00:36:44,743
I'll have one biryani as well.

738
00:36:44,793 --> 00:36:45,793
Also spicy?

739
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:49,473
[Arjun] Of course, and
two non-garlic naans.

740
00:36:53,370 --> 00:36:55,270
- Anything else?
- That's all, thank you.

741
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,590
Your good name sir?

742
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:57,640
Arjun.

743
00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:04,307
- [Teller] Pay now?
- Yeah, yeah, sure.

744
00:37:04,357 --> 00:37:07,113
$52.95 cents.

745
00:37:12,624 --> 00:37:15,624
(high pitched beep)

746
00:37:17,923 --> 00:37:20,890
Sorry sir, the card is declining.

747
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:21,940
What?

748
00:37:24,378 --> 00:37:26,493
Can you, can you try one more time please?

749
00:37:32,395 --> 00:37:34,630
(high pitched beep)

750
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:35,470
Sorry, sir.

751
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,910
Again, it's declined.

752
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,613
Do you have any other cards, sir?

753
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,710
No,

754
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,543
I'm sorry.

755
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:44,560
Yeah, you can cancel the order sorry.

756
00:37:44,610 --> 00:37:45,430
Are you sure?

757
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:46,480
Yeah.

758
00:37:48,942 --> 00:37:50,242
[Teller] Sorry sir.

759
00:37:50,292 --> 00:37:55,292
Okay.

760
00:38:27,837 --> 00:38:30,587
(dramatic score)

761
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:37,503
(engine whirs)

762
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:57,790
Hi, I'm back.

763
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,140
Hi, what happened?

764
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:00,625
Where is the food?

765
00:39:00,675 --> 00:39:04,233
I was thinking to cook
something special today for you.

766
00:39:05,370 --> 00:39:06,160
What do you mean?

767
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:07,960
But didn't you go pick up the food?

768
00:39:08,010 --> 00:39:09,863
Yeah, I, I,

769
00:39:09,913 --> 00:39:12,250
I just turned back so I thought

770
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:14,290
I will make something for you.

771
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:16,367
Oh, but it's Friday.

772
00:39:16,417 --> 00:39:18,177
We are supposed to eat out.

773
00:39:18,227 --> 00:39:20,193
Go and get food from outside.

774
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:23,830
I got you, let me try something special.

775
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:26,763
I have something's in my
mind, it's a surprise.

776
00:39:28,341 --> 00:39:29,341
Mm, okay.

777
00:39:36,519 --> 00:39:39,269
(birds chirping)

778
00:39:52,110 --> 00:39:54,400
I'm very sorry to inform
you that your contract will be

779
00:39:54,450 --> 00:39:56,950
terminated by this month end Arjun.

780
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,390
That's going to be your problem.

781
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:01,078
We are staying here and you figure it out.

782
00:40:01,128 --> 00:40:04,223
(foreign language)

783
00:40:04,273 --> 00:40:05,830
All right, I'm relying on you.

784
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:08,320
Sorry sir, again, it's declined.

785
00:40:37,219 --> 00:40:39,886
(phone ringing)

786
00:40:42,570 --> 00:40:43,896
Hi American Bank, how can I help you?

787
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:48,730
Hi, this is Arjun, and I was
trying to apply for a loan.

788
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:49,990
Uh, loan and a credit card?

789
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:51,430
Sure, I can do that.

790
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:53,130
Can I get your first name please?

791
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,720

792
00:40:55,770 --> 00:40:57,160

00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:07,188

798
00:41:08,349 --> 00:41:09,132
95,

799
00:41:09,182 --> 00:41:09,965
88,

800
00:41:10,015 --> 00:41:10,849
0, 5,

801
00:41:10,899 --> 00:41:12,070
49.

802
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:14,530
All right. I just
need your home address.

803
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:18,070
- 5311 Lakeview Avenue.
- Okay.

804
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:20,650
Now I just need to run a quick
credit check and I'll be with

805
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:22,702
you in just a second, hang on please.

806
00:41:22,752 --> 00:41:27,752
Okay, yeah.

807
00:41:31,064 --> 00:41:32,217
[Consultant] Hi, my friend.

808
00:41:32,241 --> 00:41:33,340
Oh, yes.

809
00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:35,710
I'm sorry you don't
qualify for either a loan

810
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,560
or a credit card because
of your credit score.

811
00:41:38,610 --> 00:41:39,663
I'm so sorry.

812
00:41:41,106 --> 00:41:42,606
Okay, thank you.

813
00:41:55,296 --> 00:41:58,713
(tense foreboding score)

814
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:06,183
Hey babe, what's happening?

815
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:10,233
Properties, since we
have to downsize, right?

816
00:43:12,570 --> 00:43:15,303
I'm sorry I know we are
looking at big houses.

817
00:43:16,170 --> 00:43:18,740
The dream houses and we're less...

818
00:43:21,870 --> 00:43:25,203
I was doing some math and I
think we may have a solution.

819
00:43:26,370 --> 00:43:27,573
What's your solution?

820
00:43:28,590 --> 00:43:32,590
Uh, I was thinking if
you could ask your father

821
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:34,000
for some money.

822
00:43:34,050 --> 00:43:35,591
What?

823
00:43:35,641 --> 00:43:36,843
Are you serious?

824
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:39,700
Ask my dad for money?

825
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:41,680
What's wrong with that?

826
00:43:41,730 --> 00:43:44,110
Everything is wrong with that.

827
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:45,340
No.

828
00:43:45,390 --> 00:43:46,870
Just listen, it shall help us...

829
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:49,690
No, that's not going to happen.

830
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:52,000
You didn't bring me from India for this.

831
00:43:52,050 --> 00:43:53,830
I left everything back home.

832
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:55,990
- [Arjun] But...
- For you.

833
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:57,096
- I know...
- I can't believe

834
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:58,660
you're asking me this.

835
00:43:58,710 --> 00:44:01,210
I'm not going to ask my dad for money,

836
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:05,675
no, you need to figure
this out yourself now.

837
00:44:05,725 --> 00:44:08,225
(tense music)

838
00:44:20,968 --> 00:44:23,718
(birds chirping)

839
00:44:39,990 --> 00:44:41,980
Hey, Arnab bro, how are you?

840
00:44:42,030 --> 00:44:43,060
Hey, Arjun.

841
00:44:43,110 --> 00:44:44,330
How are you?

842
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:46,780
I'm okay, man, something... You know?

843
00:44:46,830 --> 00:44:49,210
So how is your job hunt going on?

844
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:50,950
I'm applying for jobs, man.

845
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,350
It's just not happening,
I'm not getting anywhere.

846
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:55,116
Don't worry my friend,
you'll get the job.

847
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:58,330
Hey, uh... Need a favor, bro?

848
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:01,362
Can I, can you lend me $5,000 please?

849
00:45:01,412 --> 00:45:04,090
Okay, you said you need $5,000, right?

850
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:05,860
- [Arjun] Yeah.
- Okay, I'll send you,

851
00:45:05,910 --> 00:45:06,730
you'll get the money.

852
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:08,409
[Arjun] Oh, thank you.

853
00:45:08,459 --> 00:45:09,242
Yeah yeah.

854
00:45:09,292 --> 00:45:10,972
Thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you.

855
00:45:11,010 --> 00:45:12,370
Thank you, thank you so much.

856
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:15,250
I can't express how thankful I am to you.

857
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:17,290
Keep in touch, bye.

858
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:18,340
Thank you, boss.

859
00:45:27,870 --> 00:45:29,410
Yes, this is Arjun...

860
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:30,730
My name is Arjun...

861
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:32,350
Yes Arjun...

862
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:35,260
Yes, I have 10 years of
experience in database management,

863
00:45:35,310 --> 00:45:38,830
database administration
and database development.

864
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:41,133
Database management and administration.

865
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:45,850
No definitely, all those
applications we can develop.

866
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:49,300
Yes, I have done all those
things and always in operations.

867
00:45:49,350 --> 00:45:51,093
No, I don't have green card.

868
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:53,410
I understand.

869
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:54,460
Thank you.

870
00:45:55,162 --> 00:45:57,912
(sounds from TV)

871
00:46:33,570 --> 00:46:35,110
Babe.

872
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:36,340
Hmm?

873
00:46:36,390 --> 00:46:37,960
There's no food in the kitchen.

874
00:46:38,010 --> 00:46:39,860
What do you want me to do about it?

875
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:44,590
Of course, I'm hungry.

876
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:45,846
You haven't been doing anything,

877
00:46:45,870 --> 00:46:47,620
why don't you go and cook?

878
00:46:47,670 --> 00:46:48,453
- [Arjun] But...
- You really expect

879
00:46:48,503 --> 00:46:49,286
me to cook?

880
00:46:49,336 --> 00:46:51,400
- [Arjun] But...
- I'm not your maid.

881
00:46:51,450 --> 00:46:52,390
- I was just...
- I'm not your maid.

882
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:54,730
That's not why you
brought me here for, okay?

883
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:57,423
I was applying for
jobs, I just got free.

884
00:46:58,440 --> 00:46:59,840
You can go cook something.

885
00:47:02,730 --> 00:47:04,000
What would you like to eat?

886
00:47:04,050 --> 00:47:05,950
Anything, anything.

887
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,593
Just go cook, I'm busy.

888
00:47:10,290 --> 00:47:11,753
Arjun cooks.

889
00:47:11,803 --> 00:47:13,060
(laughs)

890
00:47:13,110 --> 00:47:14,463
I got you, I got you.

891
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:23,227
(phone ringing)

892
00:47:28,770 --> 00:47:29,770
Hello.

893
00:47:30,990 --> 00:47:32,253
Hey, how are you?

894
00:47:33,570 --> 00:47:35,590
I'm doing great, I'm doing excellent.

895
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:36,640
Yes.

896
00:47:37,470 --> 00:47:38,860
Oh, just, you know...

897
00:47:38,910 --> 00:47:41,380
We've been looking at houses
to move to California,

898
00:47:41,430 --> 00:47:45,250
so, I should be there maybe in two months.

899
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:46,566
Yes, you know, we've been looking

900
00:47:46,590 --> 00:47:49,773
at beautiful houses online,
like over 2 million.

901
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:51,850
Mm mm, yep.

902
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:54,220
And he's gonna buy me my Tesla soon too.

903
00:47:54,270 --> 00:47:56,950
So we'll be able to get
together once I'm there.

904
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,340
I'm thinking like two
months, two to three months.

905
00:48:00,390 --> 00:48:03,700
Yeah, I'm, I'm excited too.

906
00:48:03,750 --> 00:48:05,260
Okay.

907
00:48:05,310 --> 00:48:06,190
Yeah, I'll definitely,

908
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:08,530
I'll let you know when we
have the day and everything.

909
00:48:08,580 --> 00:48:10,540
I'll let you know okay?

910
00:48:10,590 --> 00:48:11,470
All right, got it.

911
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:13,263
Thanks for calling, bye.

912
00:48:18,771 --> 00:48:20,771
(sighs)

913
00:48:22,805 --> 00:48:25,472
(phone ringing)

914
00:48:30,270 --> 00:48:31,210
Hello sir.

915
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:32,835
Hello, Arjun.

916
00:48:32,885 --> 00:48:34,000
Yes.

917
00:48:34,050 --> 00:48:35,050
What's happening?

918
00:48:35,850 --> 00:48:37,323
It's almost three months.

919
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:40,180
You're not able to get a job?

920
00:48:40,230 --> 00:48:41,013
I'm trying, sir.

921
00:48:41,063 --> 00:48:44,530
It's, I have a lot of
interviews I have gave.

922
00:48:44,580 --> 00:48:46,680
I have also lined up some more interviews.

923
00:48:48,892 --> 00:48:50,020
Or if you're not able to

924
00:48:50,070 --> 00:48:52,930
get a job in...
I am sir.

925
00:48:52,980 --> 00:48:54,970
Definitely I can't help you, okay?

926
00:48:55,020 --> 00:48:56,020
Yes sir.

927
00:49:10,110 --> 00:49:11,620
Hello sir.

928
00:49:11,670 --> 00:49:12,670
Hi.

929
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:15,333
Yes Arjun, uh, myself.

930
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:18,520
Oh, thank you sir.

931
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:23,140
I saw this opportunity and
indeed I just had to go for it.

932
00:49:23,190 --> 00:49:26,013
So, uh, thank you for your opportunity.

933
00:49:30,570 --> 00:49:31,353
No, sir.

934
00:49:31,403 --> 00:49:33,670
I am grateful that you gave
me the opportunity for the

935
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:34,503
interview today.

936
00:49:34,553 --> 00:49:35,980
And...

937
00:49:36,030 --> 00:49:36,813
I'm here.

938
00:49:36,863 --> 00:49:39,520
I'm okay for operations too as well, sir.

939
00:49:39,570 --> 00:49:42,460
It's all part of the software
lifecycle, so, you know,

940
00:49:42,510 --> 00:49:43,863
whatever, wherever we need.

941
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:46,593
I'm pretty solid for all of that.

942
00:49:47,676 --> 00:49:49,926
(chuckles)

943
00:49:51,750 --> 00:49:52,750
Yes sir.

944
00:49:59,010 --> 00:50:00,490
No...

945
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:03,370
No sir I do not have green card,

946
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:05,680
and I do not see that in job description

947
00:50:05,730 --> 00:50:08,013
either or the previous round.

948
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:15,970
So why don't you tell this before?

949
00:50:16,020 --> 00:50:18,653
Why shouldn't this be the
first question don't you think?

950
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:23,530
You have been just wasting my
time, by all the interviews

951
00:50:23,580 --> 00:50:26,440
giving the false hope, just to
tell me that I just can't get

952
00:50:26,490 --> 00:50:28,240
this job because of the green card.

953
00:50:30,990 --> 00:50:31,990
Thank you.

954
00:50:42,150 --> 00:50:43,321
Hi.

955
00:50:43,371 --> 00:50:45,400
So, how did it go?

956
00:50:45,450 --> 00:50:47,680
Uh, I didn't like it.

957
00:50:47,730 --> 00:50:49,810
I mean, it's because of green card

958
00:50:49,860 --> 00:50:52,390
and they said they can't
sponsor green card.

959
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:54,700
Not having green card
is becoming an issue.

960
00:50:54,750 --> 00:50:56,250
What are we going to do now?

961
00:50:58,710 --> 00:51:01,510
Baby, I was thinking maybe
you could get a second job.

962
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:03,850
Are you kidding me?

963
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:05,530
I come from a rich family.

964
00:51:05,580 --> 00:51:06,820
I'm not working.

965
00:51:06,870 --> 00:51:08,647
No part-time job for me.

966
00:51:08,697 --> 00:51:10,870
But, but it, it's just for some time.

967
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:12,310
But see, I'm trying right?

968
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:13,800
All I was thinking is you could help,

969
00:51:13,824 --> 00:51:14,607
right?
(Monica whimpers)

970
00:51:14,657 --> 00:51:15,610
It would get us some time.

971
00:51:15,660 --> 00:51:18,543
Maybe you're the problem,
because you have no talent.

972
00:51:21,180 --> 00:51:23,230
Maybe you're right.

973
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:25,870
Maybe I, I don't have talent.

974
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:27,520
Dunno why my father chose you.

975
00:51:27,570 --> 00:51:29,103
I don't know why he likes you.

976
00:51:30,570 --> 00:51:32,800
See, I worship your father.

977
00:51:32,850 --> 00:51:35,100
I think he just started
like me from scratch.

978
00:51:36,090 --> 00:51:38,020
Before marriage...
You know...

979
00:51:38,070 --> 00:51:40,570
Can't believe you comparing
yourself to my father.

980
00:51:40,620 --> 00:51:43,060
He's my father, and you are my husband.

981
00:51:43,110 --> 00:51:45,850
There is no comparison, no comparison.

982
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:48,115
Do you hear me? No comparison.

983
00:51:48,165 --> 00:51:50,440
(Monica gasps)
What comparison huh?

984
00:51:50,490 --> 00:51:52,300
You don't do anything needed.

985
00:51:52,350 --> 00:51:54,370
Instead of supporting me.

986
00:51:54,420 --> 00:51:58,441
Always talking about
money, money, father...

987
00:51:58,491 --> 00:52:00,693
You make my life a living hell.

988
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:03,340
Do you understand that?

989
00:52:03,390 --> 00:52:05,770
There is no comparison, do you hear me?

990
00:52:05,820 --> 00:52:06,993
No comparison.

991
00:52:11,070 --> 00:52:13,030
What are you standing there for?

992
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:16,000
Go apply for more jobs, you need to work.

993
00:52:20,368 --> 00:52:22,868
(tense music)

994
00:52:28,172 --> 00:52:31,089
(Arjun whimpering)

995
00:52:43,096 --> 00:52:46,013
(silently sobbing)

996
00:52:56,219 --> 00:52:59,302
(crying intensifies)

997
00:53:25,427 --> 00:53:28,177
(birds chirping)

998
00:53:54,780 --> 00:53:57,780
(keyboard clacking)

999
00:54:22,950 --> 00:54:24,213
Did you find a job yet?

1000
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:27,040
Not yet.

1001
00:54:27,090 --> 00:54:28,930
Are you serious?

1002
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:31,060
I just had four interviews but...

1003
00:54:31,110 --> 00:54:32,200
I don't care.

1004
00:54:32,250 --> 00:54:33,900
When are you going to find a job?

1005
00:54:35,730 --> 00:54:36,993
You're good for nothing.

1006
00:54:38,670 --> 00:54:41,560
I don't know why my father
arranged for this marriage.

1007
00:54:41,610 --> 00:54:42,610
I'm trying.

1008
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:45,120
No, you're not trying hard enough.

1009
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:50,740
Seriously, you have one week to get a job.

1010
00:54:50,790 --> 00:54:52,990
If you don't get a job,
I'm gonna leave you.

1011
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:55,450
Do you hear me?

1012
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:56,500
I'm gonna leave you.

1013
00:54:56,550 --> 00:54:59,693
You can't do that to me.
(door slams)

1014
00:55:17,822 --> 00:55:19,120
(phone ringing)

1015
00:55:19,170 --> 00:55:20,876
Yeah this is Raj.

1016
00:55:20,926 --> 00:55:21,926
Hi Raj.

1017
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:25,780
This is Monica from matrimony.com

1018
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:28,030
Oh yeah...

1019
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:29,590
Tell me.

1020
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:31,900
I see you're looking for a wife,

1021
00:55:31,950 --> 00:55:34,630
and I'm interested in your profile.

1022
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:36,453
Oh wow, thanks.

1023
00:55:37,710 --> 00:55:39,220
Yeah.

1024
00:55:39,270 --> 00:55:41,650
Are those all your properties?

1025
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:43,390
They're beautiful.

1026
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:44,800
You own a business?

1027
00:55:44,850 --> 00:55:47,646
Yes, I own the business.

1028
00:55:47,696 --> 00:55:48,736
That's worth 20 million?

1029
00:55:50,067 --> 00:55:51,627
Yes, that's worth 20 million dollars.

1030
00:55:53,416 --> 00:55:54,953
Mm hmm, I like that.

1031
00:55:55,003 --> 00:55:57,370
You know I have a daughter?

1032
00:55:57,420 --> 00:55:58,720
Okay.

1033
00:55:58,770 --> 00:56:03,220
So um, you're gonna take
care of my daughter and I?

1034
00:56:03,270 --> 00:56:05,103
So we can get married tomorrow?

1035
00:56:07,980 --> 00:56:09,790
Yeah, sure.

1036
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:11,598
Send me the pictures.

1037
00:56:11,648 --> 00:56:14,076
Okay, I can do that.

1038
00:56:14,126 --> 00:56:17,338
And we can take it from there.

1039
00:56:17,388 --> 00:56:20,610
Yeah okay.
(door squeaks)

1040
00:56:20,660 --> 00:56:22,780
Uh, I'm gonna have to call you back, okay?

1041
00:56:22,830 --> 00:56:23,920
Okay.

1042
00:56:23,970 --> 00:56:27,200
Sounds good, See ya.
Yep, I'll call you back.

1043
00:56:28,701 --> 00:56:31,201
(tense music)

1044
00:56:32,324 --> 00:56:35,824
(phone keyboard clacking)

1045
00:56:43,467 --> 00:56:45,967
(tense music)

1046
00:56:57,419 --> 00:56:59,336
(gags)

1047
00:57:02,293 --> 00:57:03,880
H one life,

1048
00:57:03,930 --> 00:57:05,150
happy life...

1049
00:57:13,650 --> 00:57:16,250
America life, happy life...

1050
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:42,153
But who knows we need to face
all these kind of problems?

1051
00:58:05,070 --> 00:58:06,486
It go like half a brick. (rapping)

1052
00:58:06,510 --> 00:58:08,620
Oh, brick for brick, oh brick. (rapping)

1053
00:58:08,670 --> 00:58:10,540
Hey...

1054
00:58:10,590 --> 00:58:12,273
Yo, bro, you got a lighter?

1055
00:58:13,860 --> 00:58:14,794
Hey, keep it.

1056
00:58:14,844 --> 00:58:15,627
(indistinct) man.

1057
00:58:15,677 --> 00:58:17,230
What you smoking, cigarettes?

1058
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:18,839
That thing bad for your lungs.

1059
00:58:18,889 --> 00:58:19,672
Oh really?

1060
00:58:19,722 --> 00:58:22,783
Yeah, you gotta be smoking some of this.

1061
00:58:22,833 --> 00:58:25,685
This good for you.
No, thank you.

1062
00:58:25,735 --> 00:58:27,346
You need a eighth, a
quarter, a half time?

1063
00:58:27,370 --> 00:58:28,900
What's up, what you need?

1064
00:58:28,950 --> 00:58:29,860
I am... Thank you so much.

1065
00:58:29,910 --> 00:58:33,013
I sell you anything, I
got something under my hip.

1066
00:58:33,063 --> 00:58:37,030
Oh.
(gun clicks)

1067
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:38,017
This something you need.

1068
00:58:38,067 --> 00:58:39,520
You want 30, 33?

1069
00:58:39,570 --> 00:58:40,353
What you want?

1070
00:58:40,403 --> 00:58:41,403
I got a gun.

1071
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:43,247
Uh, how much?

1072
00:58:43,297 --> 00:58:45,213
$350, Glock 19.

1073
00:58:46,140 --> 00:58:47,860
Something cheaper?

1074
00:58:47,910 --> 00:58:49,863
Oh, I gotta revolver $250, boom.

1075
00:58:51,690 --> 00:58:54,430
Put a hole in your chest like binoculars.

1076
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:56,410
Okay, $200 right?

1077
00:58:56,460 --> 00:58:57,255
Lock me in, lock me in.

1078
00:58:57,305 --> 00:58:58,690
Lock me in...

1079
00:58:58,740 --> 00:59:00,100
Hey, you not a fed right?

1080
00:59:00,150 --> 00:59:01,150
No, no.

1082
00:59:07,883 --> 00:59:09,796
All right man, it's gon' keep you safe.

1083
00:59:09,846 --> 00:59:10,846
Aight...

1084
00:59:27,614 --> 00:59:30,281
(phone ringing)

1085
00:59:34,770 --> 00:59:36,190
Hello Arjun.

1086
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:37,420
Yes sir?

1087
00:59:37,470 --> 00:59:38,950
I'm really sorry, I can't help you.

1088
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,233
Sir I'm working sir.

1089
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:42,483
Give me some time.

1090
00:59:43,740 --> 00:59:45,422
It's almost five months.

1091
00:59:45,472 --> 00:59:47,320
You can't find a job.

1092
00:59:47,370 --> 00:59:49,450
You need to go back to India.

1093
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:50,733
I'm canceling your visa.

1094
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:52,863
Okay, don't call me.

1095
00:59:54,006 --> 00:59:55,006
Sir...

1096
01:00:19,136 --> 01:00:21,460
Hey Devon, how are you?

1097
01:00:21,510 --> 01:00:24,580
[Devon] Hey Arjun, long time man.

1098
01:00:24,630 --> 01:00:25,450
I'm fine.

1099
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:27,100
How about you?
Good.

1100
01:00:27,150 --> 01:00:29,163
Hey, I need a favor from you bro.

1101
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:31,690
Can you lend me about $5,000?

1102
01:00:33,450 --> 01:00:34,730
[Devon] I'm really sorry, bro.

1103
01:00:34,770 --> 01:00:37,720
Right now I'm not having

01:00:37,770 --> 01:00:40,120
Hope you can understand.
Anything,

1105
01:00:40,170 --> 01:00:41,920

I will give you $500 Arjun.

1125

But this is last time okay?

1126
01:02:12,930 --> 01:02:14,883
Please try to understand, don't repeat.

1127
01:02:17,130 --> 01:02:18,070
Thank you bro.

1128
01:02:18,120 --> 01:02:20,230
And also, can you please

1129
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:23,107
I got a good deal and I want to sell it.

01:02:25,971 --> 01:02:27,130
Okay.

01:03:17,190 --> 01:03:17,973
- Can I get the silent one?

1141
01:03:18,023 --> 01:03:21,160
No silencer, normal gun gotta boom.

Yeah.

1143
01:03:22,350 --> 01:03:23,133

[Caller] All right, take it easy.

1149
01:03:53,914 --> 01:03:56,747
(tires squealing)

1150
01:03:58,975 --> 01:04:01,975
(crickets chirping)

1151
01:05:10,073 --> 01:05:13,406
(sudden dramatic music)

1152
01:05:41,152 --> 01:05:43,735
(tires squeal)

1153
01:05:49,871 --> 01:05:52,371
(tense music)

1154
01:06:05,996 --> 01:06:08,579

1155
01:06:36,409 --> 01:06:39,930
(police sirens wailing)

1156
01:06:39,980 --> 01:06:42,980
(keyboard clacking)

1157
01:06:45,530 --> 01:06:47,590
Do you hear that cop siren?

1158
01:06:47,640 --> 01:06:48,890
What are they doing here?

1159
01:06:50,010 --> 01:06:51,460
They've been here all day,

1160
01:06:51,510 --> 01:06:52,990
Some governor speech.

1161
01:06:53,040 --> 01:06:56,170
They've been checking for guns and bombs.

1162
01:06:56,220 --> 01:06:58,750
You didn't see them with
the metal detectors?

1163
01:06:58,800 --> 01:06:59,920
No.

1164
01:06:59,970 --> 01:07:01,823
Yeah, there all day.

You okay?

Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

1167
01:07:09,840 --> 01:07:10,866
They just don't come this way.

1168
01:07:10,890 --> 01:07:12,140
That's why I'm...

1169
01:07:13,353 --> 01:07:16,520
That's for the governor, that's why.

1170
01:07:17,451 --> 01:07:20,868
(police sirens continue)

1171
01:07:40,557 --> 01:07:42,933
America is a beautiful country,

1172
01:07:44,430 --> 01:07:46,833
dream country for a lot
of people in the world.

1173
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:52,000
But if you don't have job,
impossible to survive.

1174
01:08:06,532 --> 01:08:09,459
(door squeaks)

1175
01:08:09,509 --> 01:08:12,176

1179
01:09:17,937 --> 01:09:20,520

1180
01:09:50,770 --> 01:09:52,937

1181
01:10:10,892 --> 01:10:13,559

1182
01:10:23,645 --> 01:10:26,228

(crickets chirping)

1212
01:12:00,719 --> 01:12:05,719
Maybe you're the problem
because you have no talent.

1213
01:12:06,170 --> 01:12:07,407
Do you hear me?

1214

(phone ringing)

1231
01:13:06,360 --> 01:13:07,360
[Father] Hello?

01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:09,996
Hi, dad. (voice shivering)

1233
01:13:10,020 --> 01:13:11,420
[Father] Yes, my dear son.

1234
01:13:12,780 --> 01:13:14,530
Dad, I want to come back to home.

1235
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:17,410
I want to come back.

1236
01:13:17,460 --> 01:13:18,549
[Father] All of a sudden, what happened?

1237
01:13:18,573 --> 01:13:19,803
What happened, son?

1238
01:13:20,910 --> 01:13:23,030
Dad nothing is happening.

Everything is ruined and
everything is messed step.

1240
01:13:29,820 --> 01:13:32,770
I give up dad, I just lost it dad.

1241
01:13:32,820 --> 01:13:35,290
[Father] Yeah, life
is difficult everywhere.

1242
01:13:35,340 --> 01:13:37,570
Not only there, even here.

1243
01:13:37,620 --> 01:13:39,940
Now, this is not the correct time to come.

1244
01:13:39,990 --> 01:13:42,580
You stay on there, you work very hard.

1245
01:13:42,630 --> 01:13:44,140
Prove your best.

1246
01:13:44,190 --> 01:13:47,530
I can't, I give up. (crying)

1247
01:13:47,580 --> 01:13:49,023
This is too much for me.

1248
01:13:50,430 --> 01:13:53,890
I can't be a good husband,
I can't be a good father.

1249
01:13:53,940 --> 01:13:56,493
I failed as a son dad, I'm sorry.

1250
01:13:57,328 --> 01:13:58,111
I'm sorry...
[Father] Unnecessarily...

1251
01:13:58,161 --> 01:14:00,700
You don't come here and don't put us down.

1252
01:14:00,750 --> 01:14:04,150
Don't bring our prestige
down, please, for God's sake,

1253
01:14:04,200 --> 01:14:05,347
don't come now.

1254
01:14:09,191 --> 01:14:10,858
Take care, be happy.

1255
01:14:11,971 --> 01:14:13,221
Okay?

(silently sobbing)

1258
01:14:26,572 --> 01:14:29,571
You're supposed to get me.

1259
01:14:29,621 --> 01:14:31,371
You don't understand.

1260
01:14:32,485 --> 01:14:34,318
Nobody understands me.

1261
01:14:41,121 --> 01:14:43,371
What choice do I have left?

1262
01:15:03,041 --> 01:15:06,374
(tense unnerving music)

1263
01:15:16,888 --> 01:15:19,721

1266
01:16:17,180 --> 01:16:19,113
Dad I had a bad dream.

1267
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:21,800
Oh, baby...

1268
01:16:23,285 --> 01:16:25,311
Papa'll just read a book.

1269
01:16:25,361 --> 01:16:26,444

(dark tense score)

1272
01:17:10,288 --> 01:17:11,288
No job...

1273
01:17:21,322 --> 01:17:22,572
And no money...

1274
01:17:24,778 --> 01:17:25,945
And no wife...

1275
01:18:07,099 --> 01:18:10,016
(insects chirping)

1276
01:18:25,698 --> 01:18:29,031

1308
01:21:29,790 --> 01:21:32,530

1315
01:21:41,365 --> 01:21:42,749
I can't stay, man.

1316
01:21:42,799 --> 01:21:44,349

1462
01:31:49,645 --> 01:31:52,250
Hey Arjun, this is the model you liked.

1463
01:31:52,300 --> 01:31:54,181
It's costing 2.8 million dollars.

1464
01:31:54,231 --> 01:31:56,217
It's supposed to be 2.7, right?

1465
01:31:56,267 --> 01:31:57,745
Sure, okay.

1466
01:31:57,795 --> 01:31:59,177
We can make it, we can work out.

1467
01:31:59,227 --> 01:32:00,328
We can make it that.
