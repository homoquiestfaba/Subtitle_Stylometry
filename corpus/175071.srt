1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
In the first years
of the 21 st century...

2
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,300
...a third World War broke out.

3
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,200
Those of us who survived knew

4
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:19,600
mankind could never survive...

5
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:23,300
a fourth...

6
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,900
that our own volatile natures

7
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:30,900
could simply no longer
be risked.

8
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,800
So we have created
a new arm of the law...

9
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,900
...the Grammaton Cleric,

10
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:45,500
whose sole task it is
to seek out and eradicate

11
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:51,300
the true source
of man's inhumanity to man.

12
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:57,600
His ability...

13
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,900
to feel.

14
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,100
Police!

15
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:18,900
You know what to do.

16
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:35,700
Get down!

17
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,200
We have an unknown number

18
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,800
barricaded in the southeast end
of the compound.

19
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,000
Read that.
Tetragrammaton team en route.

20
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,600
Cleric, lights out.
Maybe more than a dozen inside.

21
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:34,700
When the door's down,
blow the bulbs.

22
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,900
Yes, sir.

23
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,000
Go.

24
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:30,500
Where is he?

25
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,300
Shut up.

26
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,300
Anybody get him?
Did anybody hit him?

27
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:36,500
Shut up!

28
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,200
Listen.

29
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,200
This is it.

30
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,200
Where?

31
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,900
There.

32
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,500
It's real.

33
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,600
Burn it.

34
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,200
Why didn't you just leave it

35
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,800
for the evidentiary team
to collect and log?

36
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,900
They miss things sometimes.

37
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:25,500
And I thought
I'd take it down myself...

38
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,800
get it done properly.

39
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:35,300
How long, Preston,
till all this is gone?

40
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,500
Till we've burned
every last bit of it?

41
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,600
Resources are tight.

42
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,600
We'll get it all eventually.

43
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:55,300
Libria...

44
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:58,300
I congratulate you.

45
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,500
At last...

46
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,800
peace reigns
in the heart of man.

47
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,200
At last, war is but a word

48
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,200
whose meaning fades
from our understanding.

49
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:14,100
At last...

50
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:17,900
we... are... whole.

51
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,600
Librians... there is a disease
in the heart of man.

52
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,100
Its symptom is hate.

53
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:38,700
Its symptom... is anger.

54
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:43,400
Its symptom is rage.

55
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:48,400
Its symptom... is war.

56
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:54,900
The disease... is human emotion.

57
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:59,500
But, Libria...
I congratulate you.

58
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,800
For there is a cure
for this disease.

59
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,400
At the cost of the dizzying
highs of human emotion,

60
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:09,300
we have suppressed
its abysmal lows.

61
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:14,900
And you as a society
have embraced this cure.

62
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,800
Prozium.

63
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,200
Now we are at peace
with ourselves,

64
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,400
and humankind is one.

65
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,500
War is gone.

66
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:30,300
Hate, a memory.

67
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:33,300
We are our own conscience now.

68
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:37,900
And it is this conscience
that guides us to rate EC-10

69
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,400
for emotional content

70
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:45,000
all those things that might
tempt us to feel again...

71
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,300
and destroy them.

72
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:50,100
Librians, you have won.

73
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:54,700
Against all odds
and your own natures...

74
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,800
you have survived.

75
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,000
Every time we come
from the Nethers to the city,

76
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:25,500
it reminds why we do
what we do.

77
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,100
It does?

78
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,900
I beg your pardon.

79
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,000
It does.

80
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,200
The following items
have been rated EC-10...

81
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:54,800
condemned...

82
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,400
seven works of two-dimensional
illustrated material,

83
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,400
seven discs of musical content,

84
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:03,300
20 interactive strategy
computer programs.

85
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:06,300
Seven works
of two-dimensional...

86
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,400
Thank you
for coming, Cleric.

87
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,400
I assume you know who I am.

88
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,400
Yes, sir. Of course.

89
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:18,600
You are Vice-Council Dupont

90
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:21,100
of the Third Conciliarly
of the Tetragrammaton...

91
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:22,500
Father's voice.

92
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,300
Quite frankly, Cleric,

93
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:28,700
I am told that you are
very nearly a prodigal student,

94
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,800
knowing almost instantly
if someone is feeling.

95
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,400
I have a good record, sir.

96
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,000
Why, do you imagine,
that is, Cleric?

97
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,900
I'm not sure, Vice-Council.

98
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,900
Somehow...

99
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,900
I'm able, on some level,

100
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,800
to sense
how an offender thinks,

101
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:53,600
to... put myself
in their position.

102
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:58,600
If you had ceased
your interval,

103
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:02,500
if you were
a sense offender...

104
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,900
I suppose
you could say that, sir.

105
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,600
You're a family man, Cleric?

106
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,000
Yes, sir...
a boy and a girl.

107
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,800
The boy's in
the monastery himself,

108
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,800
on path to becoming a Cleric.

109
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,000
Good.

110
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,000
And the mother?

111
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,700
My spouse was arrested
and incinerated

112
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,700
for sense offense
four years ago, sir.

113
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:19,900
By yourself?

114
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:20,900
No, sir... by another.

115
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:25,500
How did you feel about that?

116
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,600
I'm sorry.

117
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,600
I don't...
fully understand, sir.

118
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,600
How did you feel?

119
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,500
I didn't feel anything.

120
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:40,700
Really?

121
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:43,300
How is it
that you came to miss it?

122
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,400
I...

123
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,300
I've asked myself
that same question, sir.

124
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,300
I don't know.

125
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:01,900
A nearly unforgivable lapse,
Cleric.

126
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,600
I trust you'll be
more vigilant in the future.

127
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,400
Yes, sir.

128
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,100
Every time we come
from the Nethers to the city,

129
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,100
it reminds why we do
what we do.

130
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,200
It does?

131
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,000
Every time we come
from the Nethers to the city,

132
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,800
it reminds why we do
what we do.

133
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,200
It does?

134
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,900
It does.

135
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:41,300
Prosecutorial evidence
for A.N.R. 136890.

136
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,000
I need it.

137
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,800
It was late this afternoon.

138
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,600
May not have showed up
in the records yet.

139
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:49,900
I'm very sorry, Cleric.

140
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,700
Nothing has been logged

141
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,700
and nothing is pending
under that entry.

142
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,500
It was an item of evidence
brought in personally

143
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:57,900
by Grammaton Errol Partridge.

144
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:58,800
Check again.

145
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Sir, Cleric Partridge has not
entered anything in for weeks.

146
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,400
You're mistaken.
It was a book of some kind.

147
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:07,800
Cleric...

148
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,500
...there's nothing.

149
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,500
Thank you.

150
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,400
He's been passing through
the gate into the Nether

151
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,400
every night
for the last two weeks.

152
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,600
We assumed it was
enforcement-related.

153
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,900
You always knew.

154
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,600
"But I, being poor...

155
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,800
have only my dreams."

156
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:27,300
"I have spread my dreams
under your feet.

157
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,500
"Tread softly...

158
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:34,500
because you tread
on my dreams."

159
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,600
I assume you dream, Preston.

160
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,600
I'll do what I can
to see they go easy on you.

161
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:49,100
We both know...
they never go easy.

162
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,500
Then I'm sorry.

163
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,400
No, you're not.

164
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:56,200
You don't even know
the meaning.

165
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,200
It's just a... vestigial word

166
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,400
for a feeling
you've never felt.

167
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:05,300
Don't you see, Preston?

168
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:08,100
It's gone.

169
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:11,100
Everything that makes us
what we are... traded away.

170
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,200
There's no war.

171
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,200
No murder.

172
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,200
What is it you think we do?

173
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,100
No.

174
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,300
You've been with me.

175
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,700
You've seen how it can be...
the jealousy, the rage.

176
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,100
A heavy cost.

177
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,800
I'd pay it gladly.

178
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:58,900
Don't.

179
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:44,100
You and your partner
were close?

180
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,200
I hope you're as pleased
to be assigned me

181
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,200
as I am the placement.

182
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,900
I was told this would be
a career-making advancement.

183
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:06,600
I'm like you, Cleric...
intuitive.

184
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,800
Sometimes I know
when a person's feeling

185
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,200
before they know it
themselves.

186
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,800
Cleric...

187
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,600
I can only hope one day
to be as...

188
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,400
uncompromising as you.

189
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:33,900
Good night.

190
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:38,700
The later 20th century

191
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:41,500
saw the fortuitous
and simultaneous rise

192
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
of two synergistic political
and psychological sciences.

193
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,000
The first, the revolutionary
precept of the hate crime.

194
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:54,700
John?

195
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:55,700
Yes?

196
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:59,100
I saw Robbie Taylor
crying today.

197
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,200
He didn't know, but I saw.

198
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:05,200
Do you think
I should report him?

199
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:12,300
Unquestionably.

200
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,000
...a single inescapable fact...

201
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,000
that mankind united with
infinitely greater purpose

202
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:27,000
in pursuit of war...

203
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:30,700
than he ever did
in pursuit of peace.

204
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,800
"But I, being poor...

205
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,800
have only my dreams."

206
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,800
I have spread my dreams
under your feet."

207
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,900
"Tread softly...

208
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:54,700
because you tread
on my dreams."

209
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,600
Don't move! Don't move!

210
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,400
Comply! Comply!

211
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,400
- Stop! Stop where you are!
- Get down! Get down!

212
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:50,100
Don't shoot.
This is a lawful entry.

213
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:51,500
We have a warrant
for your wife's arrest.

214
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,300
She's charged
with sense offense.

215
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,900
Get her!
Get her off him now!

216
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,000
Remember me.

217
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:27,900
- Libria...

218
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:29,900
Awake.

219
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:34,200
Awaken to triumph again
in the face of yet another day,

220
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,400
another step
in our unified march

221
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,400
- Into the unwavering purpose...

222
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,700
...move ahead together

223
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,200
into the certainty
of our collective destiny.

224
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:14,600
What are you doing?

225
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:20,300
I said, what are you doing?

226
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:23,900
I accidently dropped my...

227
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:25,500
morning interval.

228
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:28,100
I took it out
before I brushed my teeth.

229
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,200
I never take it out
before I brush my teeth.

230
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:35,800
Then you'll go by Equilibrium,
log the loss,

231
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,300
and get a replacement.

232
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:40,300
Yes.

233
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,100
Of course.

234
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:04,900
Your new partner called.

235
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,600
He says he'll pick you up
at 10:00 for the A.N.R.

236
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,000
I hope you don't mind.

237
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,800
I took the liberty
of telling him

238
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,600
you would be at Equilibrium,
replacing your dose.

239
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:16,900
No, of course not.

240
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:18,700
That was the right thing
to do.

241
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,700
Stop that.

242
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,600
Due to terrorist activity,

243
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:36,300
this site is
temporarily closed.

244
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:40,900
Proceed to the Equilibrium
Center in Sector 8A.

245
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,400
Due to terrorist activity,

246
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,400
this site is
temporarily closed.

247
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:50,200
This site is
temporarily closed.

248
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:54,000
Proceed to the Equilibrium
Center in Sector 8A.

249
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,300
More than punctual, Cleric.

250
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,400
Hop in.

251
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:17,100
How were the lines?

252
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:19,100
I'm surprised you were able
to get your interval

253
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,200
and get out so quickly.

254
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,800
No, they're...
they're fine today.

255
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,600
Maybe I'll drop by later,
get my interval adjusted.

256
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:34,900
You expecting Resistance?

257
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:38,700
That's something you'll find
about me, Cleric.

258
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,400
I'm a wary person,
cautious by nature.

259
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,600
Always expecting the worst.

260
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:49,900
You can't do this.
You cannot do this.

261
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:52,500
Tetragrammaton.
There's nothing we can't do.

262
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:56,700
How long have you been off
the dose?

263
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:57,800
Look at you.

264
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,600
Look at you!

265
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:08,700
Look at you.

266
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:13,300
The mirror's frame is illegal.
Destroy it.

267
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:24,200
We have suppression.
We're making entry.

268
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,400
Standard deployment.

269
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:29,100
Collecting catalog.
Illegal articles.

270
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,000
You're gonna burn it,
aren't you?

271
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,000
Eventually.

272
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,600
However, you couldn't have
accumulated all this

273
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:22,900
by yourself.

274
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:25,500
It'll all be sorted
and examined.

275
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:29,300
We'll discover
who your confederates are.

276
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:31,900
Gun!

277
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:51,500
We need her.

278
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,400
What's your name?

279
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,900
O'Brien, Mary.

280
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,900
Well, Mary...

281
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,100
you can either wait

282
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:29,700
and tell the technicians
at the Palace of Justice...

283
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,800
or you can tell me now.

284
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,000
Who are your friends?

285
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,900
I'm wondering if you have
any idea at all

286
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:43,700
what that word means...
"friend."

287
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,800
There's nothing
you don't feel?

288
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,000
How about guilt?

289
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,800
Let me ask you something.

290
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,400
Why are you alive?

291
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,600
I'm alive...

292
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:19,700
I live...

293
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:25,100
...to safeguard the continuity
of this great society.

294
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,400
To serve Libria.

295
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:28,600
It's circular.

296
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,200
You exist to continue
your existence.

297
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:32,600
What's the point?

298
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:36,500
What's the point
of your existence?

299
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:38,300
To feel.

300
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:41,100
'Cause you've never done it,
you can never know it.

301
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:44,100
But it's as vital as breath.

302
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:47,000
And without it...
without love,

303
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:50,000
without anger,
without sorrow...

304
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:54,600
breath is
just a clock ticking.

305
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:01,900
Then I have no choice
but to remand you

306
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,000
to the Palace of Justice
for processing.

307
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,200
Processing.

308
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:12,900
You mean execution, don't you?

309
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:16,900
Processing.

310
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,800
The Gun Katas.

311
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,600
Through analysis of thousands
of recorded gunfights,

312
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:31,700
the Cleric has determined

313
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:34,500
that the geometric distribution
of antagonists in any gun battle

314
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:37,500
is a statistically
predictable element.

315
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:40,500
The Gun Kata treats
the gun as a total weapon,

316
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,400
each fluid position
representing

317
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,400
a maximum kill zone,
inflicting maximum damage

318
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,600
on the maximum number
of opponents

319
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:49,700
while keeping
the defender clear

320
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:52,300
of the statistically
traditional trajectories

321
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:53,700
of return fire.

322
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:57,500
By the rote mastery
of this art,

323
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:00,300
your firing efficiency will rise
by no less than 120%.

324
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:03,200
The difference of a 63% increase
to lethal proficiency

325
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,400
makes the master
of the Gun Katas

326
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:10,000
an adversary not to be
taken lightly.

327
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,600
Without love...

328
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:06,400
breath is just a clock...
ticking.

329
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:50,400
Prozium...
the great nepenthe.

330
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:52,700
Opiate of our masses.

331
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:55,400
Glue of our great society.

332
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,600
Salve and salvation,

333
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:01,100
it has delivered us
from pathos, from sorrow,

334
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:05,100
the deepest chasms
of melancholy and hate.

335
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:08,300
With it, we anesthetize grief,

336
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:12,000
annihilate jealousy,
obliterate rage.

337
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:16,800
That those sister impulses
towards joy, love, and elation

338
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:19,300
are anesthetized in stride,

339
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:22,100
we accept as fair sacrifice.

340
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:27,500
For we embrace Prozium
in its unifying fullness

341
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:31,900
and all that it has done
to make us great.

342
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:25,800
Good morning, Cleric.

343
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,600
Good morning.

344
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,200
...intrinsically, humans,
as creatures of the Earth

345
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:37,500
were drawn inherently always
back to one thing... war.

346
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:41,300
And thus we seek to correct
not the symptom

347
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:44,200
but the disease itself.

348
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,200
We have sought to shrug off
individuality,

349
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:50,300
replacing it with conformity.

350
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:53,300
Replacing it...

351
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:56,200
with sameness...

352
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,300
with unity,

353
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:02,700
allowing each man, woman,
and child

354
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,200
in this great society

355
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:08,000
to lead identical lives.

356
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:13,700
The concept of identical
environment construction

357
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:16,900
allows each of us to head
confidently into each moment

358
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,100
with all the secure knowledge

359
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,800
it has been lived before.

360
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,000
What are you doing?

361
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,800
I'm rearranging my desk.

362
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:46,600
You didn't like
the way it was before?

363
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:49,700
I had no feelings about it.

364
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:51,700
I'm merely attempting
to optimize.

365
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:58,300
Sense offenders
holed up in the Nether.

366
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,400
We estimate...
we estimate 50 men, sir.

367
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,200
Intelligence tells us
they're all fully armed.

368
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:22,200
This is the group that bombed
the Prozium factories.

369
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,400
You clean, we'll sweep.

370
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:26,300
Yes, sir.

371
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:30,500
Go! Go! Go! Go!

372
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:31,700
Go!

373
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:36,100
Take it! Take the landings!

374
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,200
Cover me. I'm going in.

375
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:57,100
Nice grab, Cleric.

376
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:28,000
"Ludwig Van Beethoven."

377
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:27,300
Cleric...

378
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:30,200
Why didn't you leave that

379
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:33,000
for the evidentiary team
to collect and log?

380
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:40,300
They miss things sometimes.

381
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:42,900
I'll take it in myself...

382
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:45,900
make sure
it gets done properly.

383
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,000
You know, Preston...

384
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:54,900
If we keep burning
all this contraband,

385
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,600
eventually there won't be
anything left to burn.

386
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:00,600
What'll there be
for men like us?

387
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:03,000
Sir!

388
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,800
We got something out back.

389
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:16,600
We're gonna need
two more men on this.

390
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:24,500
These animals were defended
by women and children.

391
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:25,800
We put them down easily.

392
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,200
This isn't the first time
we've seen this.

393
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,600
Why do they keep
these animals?

394
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,600
What, do they...
do they eat them?

395
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:37,400
What do you want me
to do, sir?

396
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:39,400
Exterminate them, of course.

397
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:40,600
All right. Let's do it.

398
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,400
No.

399
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:43,500
What's wrong, Cleric?

400
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:49,400
Nothing.

401
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:05,400
Grab it.

402
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:06,400
Grab it!

403
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:16,100
Sir... toss it back in.

404
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:18,000
I'll finish it off.

405
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:24,100
Give it to me, sir.

406
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:25,900
Give it to him, Cleric.
He'll finish it.

407
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:41,000
Wait!

408
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:46,600
It seems to me that...

409
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,600
at least some of these animals
ought to be tested for disease.

410
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:51,700
If there's an epidemic
in the Nether,

411
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:54,700
it's best we know about it.

412
00:44:58,100 --> 00:45:01,200
I don't quite follow
your logic, Cleric.

413
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:02,700
They were Resistance.

414
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:04,500
They could have led us
to the Underground.

415
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:06,500
But instead of apprehension
and interrogation,

416
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:07,600
they were slaughtered.

417
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:10,300
Yes, but, Cleric,
given the circumstances,

418
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:12,500
the Father has decreed

419
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:16,100
that there will be no more
"process" for sense offenders.

420
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:18,500
They are either to be
shot on sight

421
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:20,400
or incinerated without a trial.

422
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:21,600
But it's counter to law.

423
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:23,400
You're a member
of the Council. Lf...

424
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:25,400
It is not the will
of the Council,

425
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:27,400
it is the will of Father...
and he is law.

426
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:32,100
Sir...

427
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:35,100
without the logic of process,
is it not just mayhem...

428
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:38,100
what we have worked so hard
to eradicate?

429
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:40,100
You must understand, Preston,

430
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:43,700
that while you... and even I...
may not always agree with it,

431
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:46,000
it is not the message
that is important,

432
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:49,700
it is our obedience to it.

433
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:52,100
Father's will.

434
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:54,100
Call it faith.

435
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:57,000
You have it, I assume?

436
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:03,000
Yes.

437
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:06,000
I have it.

438
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:07,100
Good.

439
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:31,500
Confiscated evidence
X23-T45...

440
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:33,700
Mary O'Brien.

441
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:37,800
Cleric John Preston
passing into the Nether...

442
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:40,000
enforcement-related.

443
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:44,100
Thank you, sir.

444
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,400
I don't know what else
to do with you.

445
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:22,700
Go on.

446
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:23,700
Go on.

447
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:27,300
Go!

448
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:04,200
Fine.

449
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,000
But you're going back
in the trunk.

450
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:21,100
Okay.

451
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:26,000
Here.

452
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:38,700
Step away from the vehicle!

453
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:40,700
Step away from the vehicle!

454
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:42,800
This is your last warning!

455
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,400
Step away from the vehicle!

456
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,600
Identification.

457
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,600
I'm a Cleric.

458
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,600
I'm here on official business.

459
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:52,700
Identification!

460
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:54,700
It's in my coat.

461
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:56,500
Where's the coat?
Where is it?

462
00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:00,500
I don't have it.

463
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:02,400
Unidentified individuals are
subject to summary destruction.

464
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:04,600
You're making
a very big mistake.

465
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:05,600
I'm a Grammaton Cleric,
first class.

466
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:06,600
We're gonna search
your vehicle.

467
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:09,400
No, you're not.
There's nothing in it.

468
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:10,500
Search it!

469
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:19,300
- Clear, sir.
- Keys to the trunk.

470
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:20,400
I'm trying to tell you.

471
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:23,000
I have a predawn combustion
to witness.

472
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:24,400
I'm not...

473
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:26,200
Captain, this is a waste
of my time.

474
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:27,400
My name is John Preston.

475
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:30,100
I'm the highest-ranking Cleric
of the Tetragramm...

476
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:32,100
Wait.

477
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:36,300
Stand off.

478
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:41,000
I'm sorry
I didn't recognize you, sir.

479
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:46,000
That's okay.
Just doing your job.

480
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:47,200
Thank you.

481
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:49,900
We'll escort you back
to the gate.

482
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:51,100
Thanks.

483
00:50:58,200 --> 00:50:59,000
Animals.

484
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:02,000
Nether's full of them.

485
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:03,800
Sounds like it came
from your trunk.

486
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:05,800
Impossible.

487
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:07,700
Just give me my keys.

488
00:51:08,100 --> 00:51:08,900
I'll be on my way.

489
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:15,900
Captain...

490
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,400
I'm asking you
one last time...

491
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:20,800
don't do this.

492
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:23,800
Down on your knees!

493
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,600
- Down on your knees!
- Down on your knees!

494
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:26,700
Drop down!

495
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:29,300
On the ground! Comply!

496
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:30,700
Do it!

497
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:32,700
No.

498
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:34,500
Fuck!

499
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:39,600
What?

500
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:42,200
Aw, shit! Shoot him!
Shoot him! Shoot him!

501
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:11,600
Always practicing, Cleric.

502
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:14,600
I guess that's why
you're the best.

503
00:54:18,100 --> 00:54:18,900
Maybe I'm just better.

504
00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:21,900
Something on your mind?

505
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:25,800
Why do you ask?

506
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,600
The intuitive arts, Cleric.

507
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,600
It's my job to know
what you're thinking.

508
00:54:40,900 --> 00:54:43,300
So, then...
what am I thinking?

509
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:51,200
About the murders
in the Nether last night...

510
00:54:57,700 --> 00:54:59,300
And if they know who did it.

511
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:06,400
Am I close?

512
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:11,200
So, tell me... do they know?

513
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:22,000
There are theories.

514
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:24,000
I have one or two of my own,
but at the moment...

515
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:26,000
they're premature!

516
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:32,100
I'm glad it happened.

517
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:38,100
Why?

518
00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:39,900
Because now
Father and the Council

519
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:43,400
have decreed an acceleration
in the crackdown on offenders.

520
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:45,800
Whoever did it...

521
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:48,600
all they accomplished was
a quicker end to the Resistance.

522
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,600
It's gonna be
a massacre, Cleric.

523
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:20,000
I came to tell you...
there's a raid in the Nether...

524
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:23,200
Sector 7.

525
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:26,400
So get ready.

526
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:09,100
That door behind you...

527
00:57:11,300 --> 00:57:12,100
Go.

528
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:15,000
Go, damn you!

529
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:21,800
Get out of here, God damn it!
If you don't, you're dead!

530
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:23,000
Don't do it.
He'll shoot us in the back.

531
00:57:24,100 --> 00:57:24,900
If I was gonna shoot you,
I'd shoot you in the face.

532
00:57:26,100 --> 00:57:26,900
Now go.

533
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,600
Damn you! Follow me.

534
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,400
Now! Let's go!

535
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:47,700
There will be no detention.

536
00:57:47,900 --> 00:57:51,100
Repeat...
no detention for any purpose.

537
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:55,000
All prisoners and apprehendees
are to be put down.

538
00:58:03,700 --> 00:58:05,300
Look out!

539
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:20,000
Cleric, what's happening?
We heard gunshots.

540
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:22,300
Go!

541
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:24,100
What are you doing?
Cleric!

542
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:26,100
They're Resistance fighters.

543
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:28,300
Cleric!

544
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:32,200
He's a sense offender!

545
00:59:15,900 --> 00:59:16,700
Cover all quadrants!

546
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:18,500
Secure the perimeter!

547
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:30,600
What is this?

548
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:33,400
What are you doing?

549
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:36,200
Nicely done, Cleric.

550
00:59:36,700 --> 00:59:38,300
You drive them
into the trap...

551
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:41,500
I close it.

552
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:51,600
The very definition
of... teamwork.

553
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:54,200
Don't you think?

554
00:59:56,500 --> 00:59:59,700
Why don't you take the honors
of the execution, Cleric?

555
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:05,800
These people should be taken
for clinical interrogation.

556
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:08,000
Cleric...

557
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:10,000
Father's rulings
are quite clear.

558
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:12,800
Offenders are to be shot
on sight.

559
01:00:13,300 --> 01:00:14,100
They have valuable information.

560
01:00:15,300 --> 01:00:16,100
Cleric...

561
01:00:16,300 --> 01:00:17,100
They can be put to
much better use.

562
01:00:17,300 --> 01:00:18,100
Cleric.

563
01:00:20,300 --> 01:00:22,700
If your weapon's low,
please, use mine.

564
01:01:12,700 --> 01:01:12,700
No.

565
01:01:16,700 --> 01:01:18,300
I think, in the end...

566
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:20,200
it'll be better
if you have it.

567
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:43,200
Captain.

568
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:45,000
Yes, sir. Firing positions.

569
01:01:50,300 --> 01:01:51,100
Ready...

570
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:01,000
Aim...

571
01:02:08,100 --> 01:02:08,900
Fire!

572
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,600
Sir?

573
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,600
Yes, Cleric?

574
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,400
You asked me to become
Father's instrument

575
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,600
against the Resistance.

576
01:02:24,900 --> 01:02:26,500
I'm ready.

577
01:02:27,900 --> 01:02:28,700
Today.

578
01:02:29,900 --> 01:02:30,700
I wish to show my faith.

579
01:02:32,900 --> 01:02:34,500
I wish, with your permission,

580
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:37,200
to locate the Underground
once and for all.

581
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:39,400
To destroy it.

582
01:02:42,700 --> 01:02:43,500
To destroy it.

583
01:02:43,700 --> 01:02:45,300
Good. Do it.

584
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:58,000
I'm so...

585
01:02:58,600 --> 01:03:00,200
so very sorry.

586
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:14,600
These are the possessions he had
on him at the time of death.

587
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:16,200
The illegal ones
will be burned with him.

588
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:17,200
Good.

589
01:03:58,900 --> 01:03:59,700
Errol Partridge.

590
01:04:03,900 --> 01:04:06,300
The name supposed to mean
something to me?

591
01:04:06,900 --> 01:04:08,500
He was a Grammaton Cleric,
first class. You knew him.

592
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:12,000
News bulletin...
I'm a sense offender.

593
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:14,400
I don't hang around much
with the Cleric.

594
01:04:21,700 --> 01:04:23,300
I want to know about him.

595
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:27,400
Well...

596
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:30,000
I suggest you go ask him.

597
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:35,000
But I understand
that he's dead...

598
01:04:35,500 --> 01:04:37,900
killed by your friends
at the Tetragrammaton.

599
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:40,900
Not by my friends.

600
01:04:41,500 --> 01:04:43,100
By me.

601
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:28,600
You were lovers.

602
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:48,400
The Underground is our foe,

603
01:05:49,800 --> 01:05:51,400
and greater
than even the threat

604
01:05:51,700 --> 01:05:54,900
of those who have forsaken
their Prozium for emotion

605
01:05:55,700 --> 01:05:59,700
is the threat of those
selfsame individuals united.

606
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:03,000
They are
the secret organization...

607
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:12,000
And thus, it is in the writing
of the Father

608
01:06:12,500 --> 01:06:13,300
that we find our greatest...

609
01:06:15,500 --> 01:06:17,100
Good afternoon, sir.

610
01:06:17,500 --> 01:06:19,900
What will it be for you?

611
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:22,000
The latest copy
of the inserts?

612
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:24,000
Revised edition
of the manifesto?

613
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:25,200
Errol Partridge.

614
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:27,800
What do you know about him?

615
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:29,200
I beg your pardon?

616
01:06:29,300 --> 01:06:30,900
Everyone out. Now.

617
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:46,800
I'm gonna ask you
one more time.

618
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:49,600
Errol Partridge...
what do you know about him?

619
01:06:50,100 --> 01:06:52,500
I'm sure this must be
some mis...

620
01:06:53,100 --> 01:06:54,700
- You're an offender.
- I'm not.

621
01:06:55,100 --> 01:06:57,500
No? Then why are you
so scared of me?

622
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,400
Now, you will tell me everything
you know about Errol Partridge,

623
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:02,600
or I will have a wagon
come to take you

624
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,400
to the Hall of Destruction
for summary combustion.

625
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:07,600
I really don't know...

626
01:07:07,900 --> 01:07:08,700
Speak!

627
01:07:08,900 --> 01:07:12,100
He... he'd come in here
with a fellow named Jurgen.

628
01:07:12,900 --> 01:07:13,700
Why?

629
01:07:13,900 --> 01:07:16,300
That's... that's all I know.
I swear.

630
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:18,600
Jurgen!

631
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:40,200
Interesting.

632
01:08:18,200 --> 01:08:20,600
We've been watching you,
Preston.

633
01:08:27,100 --> 01:08:28,700
You're Jurgen.

634
01:08:30,100 --> 01:08:32,500
You're feeling.

635
01:08:46,900 --> 01:08:48,500
Do you know why you came?

636
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:14,000
Welcome to the Underground.

637
01:09:24,500 --> 01:09:26,100
Polygraph.

638
01:09:26,500 --> 01:09:29,700
It detects fluctuations
of human emotion.

639
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:32,000
We have to be sure.

640
01:09:37,300 --> 01:09:38,900
Mary.

641
01:09:45,300 --> 01:09:46,900
You're carrying
in your left pocket

642
01:09:47,200 --> 01:09:49,600
a red ribbon
sprayed with her scent.

643
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:54,000
You breathe it in sometimes

644
01:09:55,200 --> 01:09:56,800
when you think
there's no one to see.

645
01:09:57,100 --> 01:10:00,300
But what you feel...

646
01:10:02,100 --> 01:10:03,700
what you feel
could only be satisfied

647
01:10:04,100 --> 01:10:06,500
by falling yourself into her.

648
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:15,200
She's scheduled
for combustion...

649
01:10:15,900 --> 01:10:17,500
tomorrow.

650
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:25,400
I know.

651
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:29,200
You know, I was like you.

652
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:33,000
But the first thing
you learn about emotion

653
01:10:33,700 --> 01:10:35,300
is that it has its price...

654
01:10:35,700 --> 01:10:38,100
a complete paradox.

655
01:10:38,700 --> 01:10:41,100
But without restraint...

656
01:10:41,700 --> 01:10:43,300
without control...

657
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:45,200
emotion is chaos.

658
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:47,200
But how is that diff...

659
01:10:48,600 --> 01:10:51,000
The difference being is
that when we want to feel,

660
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:53,200
we can.

661
01:10:53,500 --> 01:10:56,700
It's just that...

662
01:10:57,500 --> 01:11:00,700
some of us...

663
01:11:01,500 --> 01:11:03,100
some of us have to forgo
that luxury

664
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:05,800
so that the rest can have it.

665
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:08,000
Some very few of us

666
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:11,800
have to force ourselves
not to feel.

667
01:11:14,300 --> 01:11:15,100
Like me.

668
01:11:17,300 --> 01:11:18,900
Like you.

669
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:25,800
What can I do?

670
01:11:29,200 --> 01:11:30,800
You can kill Father.

671
01:12:05,800 --> 01:12:07,400
- Cleric John Preston...

672
01:12:07,700 --> 01:12:10,100
you are to come with us
immediately.

673
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:21,200
Cleric Preston.

674
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:23,200
Sir.

675
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:28,800
I've heard
the most disturbing rumor.

676
01:12:29,500 --> 01:12:30,300
Rumor, sir?

677
01:12:30,500 --> 01:12:31,300
Yes.

678
01:12:31,500 --> 01:12:33,100
A rumor maintaining
that one of us,

679
01:12:33,500 --> 01:12:35,100
one of the Cleric,

680
01:12:35,500 --> 01:12:38,700
has secretly taken it upon
himself to cease his dose,

681
01:12:39,400 --> 01:12:41,800
that one of our elite number

682
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:44,800
is actually feeling.

683
01:12:45,300 --> 01:12:46,900
Feeling, sir?

684
01:12:48,300 --> 01:12:50,700
Are you playing with me,
Cleric?

685
01:12:56,200 --> 01:12:57,800
No, sir.

686
01:13:03,200 --> 01:13:05,600
This person, I'm told,

687
01:13:06,100 --> 01:13:09,300
is actually attempting
to contact the Resistance.

688
01:13:12,100 --> 01:13:15,300
Now tell me,
if you'll be so kind,

689
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:17,600
how exactly...

690
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,400
have you been making use
of your time of late?

691
01:13:26,900 --> 01:13:29,300
Attempting to contact
the Resistance, sir.

692
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:36,400
Attempting?

693
01:13:37,800 --> 01:13:41,000
How is it that you intend
to expose this traitor

694
01:13:41,700 --> 01:13:44,100
if all you do is attempt?

695
01:13:50,700 --> 01:13:52,300
You're...

696
01:13:52,600 --> 01:13:53,400
absolutely...

697
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:56,200
100% right, sir.

698
01:13:57,600 --> 01:13:59,200
Of course I am.

699
01:14:02,500 --> 01:14:04,900
The Cleric is the final line
of defense.

700
01:14:05,500 --> 01:14:07,100
If the Resistance
compromises it,

701
01:14:08,500 --> 01:14:10,100
we are doomed.

702
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:13,600
Father is doomed.

703
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:16,800
I will redouble
my efforts, sir,

704
01:14:17,400 --> 01:14:18,200
to locate the Resistance,

705
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:20,000
to find this traitor,

706
01:14:20,300 --> 01:14:22,700
and bring them all to
the Council's fair justice.

707
01:14:28,300 --> 01:14:29,100
Do it.

708
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:13,600
What are you doing?

709
01:15:17,700 --> 01:15:18,500
What are you doing?

710
01:15:21,700 --> 01:15:23,300
I...

711
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:31,000
I was checking
to make sure you've been...

712
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:32,400
taking your interval.

713
01:15:34,600 --> 01:15:35,400
And are you satisfied?

714
01:15:39,500 --> 01:15:40,300
Yes, I am.

715
01:15:43,500 --> 01:15:45,100
Good night, Dad.

716
01:15:47,400 --> 01:15:48,200
I don't understand.

717
01:15:49,400 --> 01:15:51,000
My execution's set.

718
01:15:51,400 --> 01:15:53,800
Why are you here?

719
01:16:13,100 --> 01:16:13,900
Aren't you gonna dose?

720
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:29,600
My God.

721
01:16:31,900 --> 01:16:32,700
What...

722
01:16:35,900 --> 01:16:37,500
What'll you do?

723
01:16:39,900 --> 01:16:41,500
I don't know.

724
01:17:15,500 --> 01:17:17,100
50 sweepers, maybe more.

725
01:17:17,500 --> 01:17:19,100
What about an audience? Can you
arrange to meet with him?

726
01:17:19,400 --> 01:17:21,000
Father's never given a single
audience since the upheaval.

727
01:17:21,400 --> 01:17:23,000
The danger of assassination
is too great.

728
01:17:23,400 --> 01:17:25,000
They trained you your whole life
to fight these kind of odds.

729
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:27,000
Even if I could...

730
01:17:27,400 --> 01:17:29,000
even if I could
make it through,

731
01:17:29,300 --> 01:17:31,700
what guarantee is there
it would accomplish anything,

732
01:17:32,300 --> 01:17:33,100
that anything would be
different?

733
01:17:34,300 --> 01:17:35,900
We have a network that's larger
than you could ever imagine.

734
01:17:36,300 --> 01:17:37,900
Instant word comes
that Father is dead,

735
01:17:38,200 --> 01:17:39,800
that the Council is leaderless.

736
01:17:40,200 --> 01:17:41,800
Bombs that have already
been planted will be set off

737
01:17:42,200 --> 01:17:43,800
at Prozium clinics and factories
around Libria.

738
01:17:44,200 --> 01:17:46,600
If we can succeed
in disrupting the supply

739
01:17:47,100 --> 01:17:48,700
for even one day... one day...

740
01:17:50,100 --> 01:17:51,700
our cause will be won
by human nature itself.

741
01:17:52,100 --> 01:17:54,500
What about war, the everyday
cruelties that are all gone now?

742
01:17:55,100 --> 01:17:56,700
Replaced by the touch
of Grammaton.

743
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:02,600
Will you do it?

744
01:18:10,900 --> 01:18:12,500
Yes.

745
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:15,600
Can you?

746
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:20,600
I don't know.

747
01:18:31,700 --> 01:18:32,500
Don't...

748
01:18:34,600 --> 01:18:36,200
Seeing her one last time

749
01:18:36,600 --> 01:18:39,000
will only make it harder
to do what you have to do.

750
01:19:13,200 --> 01:19:15,600
...designed especially
to deal with it.

751
01:19:16,200 --> 01:19:17,800
The Cleric was implemented

752
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:19,800
and sent out to search
and destroy

753
01:19:20,200 --> 01:19:21,800
such objects that remained

754
01:19:22,100 --> 01:19:24,500
and, if necessary,
those who attempted to...

755
01:19:25,100 --> 01:19:25,900
File footage.

756
01:19:26,100 --> 01:19:29,300
The Council...

757
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:31,600
Viviana Preston.

758
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:33,600
Sentence and incineration.

759
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:37,800
Auditory.

760
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:39,600
Viviana Preston,

761
01:19:39,900 --> 01:19:41,500
for ceasing your interval,
for the crime of feeling,

762
01:19:41,900 --> 01:19:42,700
you stand condemned

763
01:19:42,900 --> 01:19:45,300
to suffer annihilation
in the city furnaces.

764
01:19:45,900 --> 01:19:48,300
You will be taken there
immediately, and you will burn.

765
01:20:05,700 --> 01:20:07,300
The Cleric was implemented

766
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:09,200
and sent out to search
and destroy

767
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:11,200
such objects that remained

768
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:14,800
and, if necessary,
those who attempted to...

769
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:17,200
The Council...

770
01:20:57,100 --> 01:20:58,700
The incineration...
has it gone through?

771
01:20:59,100 --> 01:21:00,700
It's going through now.

772
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:33,200
Machine turbines priming.

773
01:21:33,700 --> 01:21:34,500
Machine turbines priming.

774
01:21:34,700 --> 01:21:36,300
Tetragrammaton... I need
to speak to this woman!

775
01:21:37,700 --> 01:21:38,500
You're too late, sir.
The time lock is engaged.

776
01:21:38,700 --> 01:21:39,500
If we force the door now,

777
01:21:40,700 --> 01:21:41,500
the turbines will explode
at street level.

778
01:21:41,700 --> 01:21:44,900
...personnel,
clear the area immediately.

779
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:48,800
All unauthorized personnel,
clear the area immediately.

780
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:52,000
Turbines primed.

781
01:21:52,500 --> 01:21:54,900
Fire in 10 seconds...

782
01:21:55,500 --> 01:21:57,100
9 seconds...

783
01:21:57,500 --> 01:21:58,300
8 seconds...

784
01:21:58,500 --> 01:22:00,100
7 seconds...

785
01:22:00,500 --> 01:22:02,100
6 seconds...

786
01:22:02,400 --> 01:22:04,000
5 seconds...

787
01:22:04,400 --> 01:22:05,200
4 seconds...

788
01:22:05,400 --> 01:22:07,000
3 seconds...

789
01:22:07,400 --> 01:22:09,800
2 seconds...

790
01:22:10,300 --> 01:22:12,700
Turbines... fire.

791
01:23:03,900 --> 01:23:06,300
Cleric John Preston...

792
01:23:11,700 --> 01:23:13,300
You are under arrest.

793
01:23:15,700 --> 01:23:17,300
This man...

794
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:19,200
this senior Cleric...

795
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:21,200
has ceased the dose.

796
01:23:22,600 --> 01:23:25,000
He is feeling!

797
01:23:25,500 --> 01:23:28,700
He is the worm that has been
eating at the core

798
01:23:29,500 --> 01:23:31,900
of our great society!

799
01:23:32,500 --> 01:23:33,300
And I...

800
01:23:34,500 --> 01:23:36,100
I have brought him
for your justice.

801
01:23:41,400 --> 01:23:44,700
I told you I'd make my career
with you, Preston.

802
01:23:46,500 --> 01:23:48,100
Vice-Council...

803
01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:49,900
This man is guilty

804
01:23:50,300 --> 01:23:51,900
of consorting
with sense offenders,

805
01:23:52,300 --> 01:23:54,700
of having relations
with a female,

806
01:23:55,200 --> 01:23:57,600
of sense crime itself.

807
01:23:59,200 --> 01:24:00,800
Dispatch a search team
to the Cleric's quarters

808
01:24:01,200 --> 01:24:02,000
to search for unused...

809
01:24:02,200 --> 01:24:03,000
That won't be necessary, sir.

810
01:24:03,100 --> 01:24:04,700
If you'll run the trace
record on his side arm,

811
01:24:05,100 --> 01:24:06,700
you will find
that it was he

812
01:24:07,100 --> 01:24:09,500
who was with the sweeper team
when they were murdered.

813
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:16,800
Cleric...

814
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,400
I assume you have something
to say to me.

815
01:24:21,900 --> 01:24:23,600
I know...

816
01:24:24,100 --> 01:24:25,700
it's hard to believe...

817
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,300
...that a Cleric
of the Tetragrammaton

818
01:24:30,900 --> 01:24:34,100
could turn his back
on everything he's been taught,

819
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:36,400
would become associated
with the Resistance,

820
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:40,000
even becoming a champion
in its Underground.

821
01:24:40,700 --> 01:24:42,300
But it's true.

822
01:24:46,700 --> 01:24:50,700
I promised that I would
bring you that man.

823
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:52,400
And I have.

824
01:24:55,600 --> 01:24:57,200
- Cleric Brandt...
- Sir?

825
01:24:57,600 --> 01:25:00,000
The trace shows
that it was your gun

826
01:25:00,500 --> 01:25:03,000
in the Nether
with the sweepers.

827
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:04,400
That's impossible.

828
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:11,900
This is wrong.

829
01:25:12,400 --> 01:25:14,800
I think, in the end...

830
01:25:15,400 --> 01:25:17,800
it'll be better
if you have it.

831
01:25:18,300 --> 01:25:19,100
He switched them.

832
01:25:20,300 --> 01:25:21,900
He switched them.

833
01:25:22,300 --> 01:25:23,900
See, I have his gun now.

834
01:25:24,300 --> 01:25:26,700
Of course you do. You took it
when you arrested me.

835
01:25:27,300 --> 01:25:28,100
What?

836
01:25:28,200 --> 01:25:29,800
Take him
to the Hall of Destruction

837
01:25:30,200 --> 01:25:31,800
for summary judgment
and combustion.

838
01:25:33,200 --> 01:25:34,800
Wait, wait, wait. Wait!
I can explain this.

839
01:25:35,200 --> 01:25:37,600
Sir, I'm not feeling!

840
01:25:38,100 --> 01:25:40,500
He is the one who's feeling!

841
01:25:41,100 --> 01:25:41,900
This is a mistake!

842
01:25:44,200 --> 01:25:45,800
Of course...

843
01:25:46,200 --> 01:25:48,600
since a complaint
has been lodged,

844
01:25:49,100 --> 01:25:51,500
law and the letter
is that I allow a team

845
01:25:52,100 --> 01:25:54,400
to carry out the search
of your premises.

846
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:56,600
Do you think that's entirely
necessary, Cleric,

847
01:25:56,900 --> 01:26:00,100
or am I being
too... exacting?

848
01:26:00,900 --> 01:26:02,500
As you say, sir,

849
01:26:02,900 --> 01:26:04,500
it's the law and the letter.

850
01:26:04,900 --> 01:26:07,300
And it doesn't disturb you
in the least

851
01:26:07,800 --> 01:26:10,200
that your colleague
is going to his end?

852
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:12,400
The only thing
that disturbs me, sir,

853
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:15,200
is that I am Father's instrument
against the Underground,

854
01:26:15,700 --> 01:26:19,700
and yet... I've never had
the honor of meeting him.

855
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:24,400
Yes, but, Cleric, you know

856
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:27,200
that Father never grants
an audience to anyone.

857
01:26:27,700 --> 01:26:30,100
Even to the man
who brings him the Resistance?

858
01:26:42,500 --> 01:26:44,100
Sorry, sir.
Just a formality.

859
01:26:44,400 --> 01:26:46,000
The search team will be up
momentarily.

860
01:26:46,400 --> 01:26:48,800
Excellent.
I have nothing to hide.

861
01:27:09,300 --> 01:27:10,900
The search teams are
already inside, sir.

862
01:27:11,300 --> 01:27:12,100
Excellent.

863
01:27:32,900 --> 01:27:35,300
Looking for something?

864
01:27:39,800 --> 01:27:41,500
If I were you...

865
01:27:41,900 --> 01:27:45,900
I'd be more careful
in the future.

866
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:53,400
How long?

867
01:27:53,800 --> 01:27:55,400
Since Mom.

868
01:27:58,600 --> 01:27:59,400
And Lisa?

869
01:27:59,600 --> 01:28:00,400
Of course.

870
01:28:05,600 --> 01:28:07,200
How did you know?

871
01:28:07,600 --> 01:28:09,200
You forget...

872
01:28:10,500 --> 01:28:12,100
it's my job to know
what you're thinking.

873
01:28:15,500 --> 01:28:17,900
Then you know what
I'm gonna do now.

874
01:28:20,400 --> 01:28:20,400
You have a message
for the Vice-Council?

875
01:28:20,400 --> 01:28:22,900
You have a message
for the Vice-Council?

876
01:28:23,500 --> 01:28:25,100
It's done.

877
01:28:25,500 --> 01:28:28,700
I've located the Resistance.

878
01:28:29,400 --> 01:28:31,000
Come now.

879
01:28:31,400 --> 01:28:33,000
You'll have them all.

880
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,400
Do not address Father
unless first addressed by him.

881
01:28:59,000 --> 01:28:59,800
Avoid eye contact.

882
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,500
If you should break
his personal security zone,

883
01:29:03,100 --> 01:29:05,500
you will be immediately
put down by snipers.

884
01:29:06,100 --> 01:29:06,900
Is that understood?

885
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,400
You'll be required to surrender
your firearm, of course,

886
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:12,600
and then there's the test.

887
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:13,800
Test?

888
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,400
Yes.

889
01:29:17,900 --> 01:29:20,300
You didn't imagine
we would risk exposing Father

890
01:29:20,900 --> 01:29:22,400
to even such a dedicated servant
as yourself

891
01:29:22,800 --> 01:29:26,000
without first having
tested you, did you?

892
01:29:29,700 --> 01:29:31,300
Please.

893
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:46,400
Cleric...

894
01:29:47,600 --> 01:29:49,200
your weapon, please.

895
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:55,200
Here.

896
01:30:00,500 --> 01:30:01,300
Sit.

897
01:30:05,300 --> 01:30:06,900
We'll start with
a test question first.

898
01:30:07,300 --> 01:30:09,700
More of a riddle, actually.

899
01:30:12,200 --> 01:30:13,800
What would you say
is the easiest way

900
01:30:14,200 --> 01:30:15,800
to get a weapon away
from a Grammaton Cleric?

901
01:30:21,100 --> 01:30:23,600
You ask him for it.

902
01:30:31,200 --> 01:30:33,600
I told you I'd make
my career with you, Cleric.

903
01:30:38,100 --> 01:30:38,900
...to combine the capacity...

904
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:41,800
Preston...

905
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:43,600
Brandt's job was simple...

906
01:30:44,900 --> 01:30:46,500
to make you feel
like you'd won,

907
01:30:46,900 --> 01:30:49,300
to make you feel safe.

908
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:56,000
For years, I tried
to infiltrate an agent

909
01:30:56,800 --> 01:30:58,400
into the Underground...

910
01:30:59,700 --> 01:31:01,400
...until it hit me...

911
01:31:01,800 --> 01:31:05,000
in order to pass undetected
into their midst,

912
01:31:05,800 --> 01:31:08,200
in order to be trusted by them,

913
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:12,800
my provocateur would
have to think like them

914
01:31:13,700 --> 01:31:16,100
and would have to feel
like them.

915
01:31:16,700 --> 01:31:19,100
But where to find
such a man...

916
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:23,600
a man with the capacity to feel
who didn't yet know it?

917
01:31:27,400 --> 01:31:29,800
But...

918
01:31:30,400 --> 01:31:31,200
we've never met.

919
01:31:31,400 --> 01:31:33,000
No?

920
01:31:38,300 --> 01:31:40,800
Don't look so surprised,
Preston.

921
01:31:41,400 --> 01:31:43,000
Why should Father be more real

922
01:31:43,400 --> 01:31:45,000
than any other
political puppet?

923
01:31:45,400 --> 01:31:47,800
The real Father died
years ago.

924
01:31:48,300 --> 01:31:49,900
The Council simply elected me

925
01:31:50,300 --> 01:31:52,700
to pursue
his paternal tradition.

926
01:31:53,300 --> 01:31:55,700
And you, Preston,

927
01:31:56,200 --> 01:31:57,800
the supposed savior
of the Resistance,

928
01:31:59,200 --> 01:32:00,000
are now its destroyer,

929
01:32:01,200 --> 01:32:04,400
and, along with them,
you've given me yourself...

930
01:32:05,200 --> 01:32:06,800
calmly...

931
01:32:07,100 --> 01:32:08,600
cooly...

932
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:13,000
entirely without incident.

933
01:32:17,900 --> 01:32:18,700
No.

934
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:23,800
Shit.

935
01:32:25,900 --> 01:32:27,500
Not without incident.

936
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:35,600
I'm coming.

937
01:34:03,900 --> 01:34:05,500
You really should learn
to knock.

938
01:34:32,600 --> 01:34:35,000
How did it feel, Preston?

939
01:35:16,100 --> 01:35:18,500
Mind the uniform, Cleric.

940
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,400
I plan to be wearing it
for a long time.

941
01:36:02,600 --> 01:36:05,000
Be careful, Preston.

942
01:36:05,600 --> 01:36:07,200
You're treading on my dreams.

943
01:36:44,200 --> 01:36:45,000
Wait!

944
01:36:45,200 --> 01:36:46,800
Wait.

945
01:36:47,200 --> 01:36:48,000
Look at me.

946
01:36:48,100 --> 01:36:48,900
Look at me.

947
01:36:51,100 --> 01:36:52,700
I'm life.

948
01:36:53,100 --> 01:36:56,300
I live, I breathe...

949
01:36:59,000 --> 01:36:59,700
I feel.

950
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,400
Now that you know it...

951
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,400
can you really take it?

952
01:37:07,900 --> 01:37:09,500
Is it really worth the price?

953
01:37:15,900 --> 01:37:17,500
I pay it gladly.

in his conquest

more than one million

Three centuries later,

Gaius Germanicus, "Caligula,"
