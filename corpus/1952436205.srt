1
00:00:48,915 --> 00:00:51,179
Stick him, B, stick him!

2
00:00:53,319 --> 00:00:56,413
Come on, B!
Come on, B!

3
00:01:28,688 --> 00:01:31,418
Oh my God!

4
00:01:31,491 --> 00:01:33,482
Oh yeah!

5
00:01:35,128 --> 00:01:37,255
Put him to bed, son.
Put him to bed, B.

6
00:01:38,798 --> 00:01:40,732
There you go, son.

7
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,631
Put him to bed, B.
Come on, B.

8
00:01:42,702 --> 00:01:44,226
Put him to bed, B.
Put him to bed.

9
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:52,306
Yeah, there we go, son.

10
00:01:52,378 --> 00:01:54,243
There we go.
That's it.

11
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:00,450
# Bet your ass, motherfucker #

12
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,579
# You ain't know? #

13
00:02:02,655 --> 00:02:04,418
# Shit changed, pussy #

14
00:02:04,491 --> 00:02:06,823
# We running this shit now #

15
00:02:06,893 --> 00:02:08,656
# We can't run out here #

16
00:02:08,728 --> 00:02:10,787
# We got pushed a lot #

17
00:02:10,864 --> 00:02:13,958
# But you better get
your motherfucking weight up #

18
00:02:14,033 --> 00:02:16,092
# Pussy #

19
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:18,501
# Y'all leave the street now,
big mouth, you better take a seat now #

20
00:02:18,571 --> 00:02:21,005
# If you speak foul, you'll get
smacked up with the heat now #

21
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:23,508
# Keep it discreet
on the concrete now #

22
00:02:23,576 --> 00:02:25,771
# Kick all 100 feet,
catching a beatdown #

23
00:02:25,845 --> 00:02:28,473
# Y'all leave the street now, big mouth,
you better take a seat now #

24
00:02:28,548 --> 00:02:31,016
# If you speak foul, you'll get
smacked up with the heat now #

25
00:02:31,084 --> 00:02:33,314
# Keep it discreet
on the concrete now #

26
00:02:33,386 --> 00:02:35,820
# Kick all 100 feet,
catching a beatdown #

27
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:38,585
# It all started and really began
with this cold-hearted man #

28
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:41,149
# Who kept guns knowing
he wasn't nice with the hands #

29
00:02:41,227 --> 00:02:43,161
# And running pistols
was his whole plan #

30
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:44,856
# He was supposed
to be my fan #

31
00:02:44,931 --> 00:02:47,195
# How can I fuck with fam
who fucks a man? #

32
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:48,996
# Plus I
couldn't understand #

33
00:02:49,068 --> 00:02:51,502
# How some of these niggas
hopped on his bandwagon #

34
00:02:51,571 --> 00:02:53,835
# Braggin' about
bitches they was baggin' #

35
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:55,841
# And speaking like a deacon
with a dragon #

36
00:02:55,909 --> 00:02:58,503
# And bringing the agony
to me and my peon #

37
00:02:58,578 --> 00:03:00,910
# Every day bitch-ass shit
is what he be on #

38
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:03,642
# Nailing fat bitches
and Pathfinders and Neons #

39
00:03:03,716 --> 00:03:05,911
# Trying to be primetime
just like Deon #

40
00:03:05,985 --> 00:03:08,180
# Pulling the sock out,
talking about #

41
00:03:08,254 --> 00:03:10,154
# How he got clout
to rub cops out #

42
00:03:10,223 --> 00:03:12,589
# How niggas pull their Glocks out,
and clean the blocks out #

43
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:14,889
# Reaching in the sock
and pulling some rocks out #

44
00:03:14,961 --> 00:03:17,930
# And yelling he got into jail
on a serious felony #

45
00:03:17,997 --> 00:03:20,227
# Plus some other shit
he was telling me #

46
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,892
# I ignored him,
laid him to the side #

47
00:03:21,968 --> 00:03:23,595
# Told me, "Come on,
let's take a ride" #

48
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,638
# I had to dip and slide
to the left #

49
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:27,570
# He was wanted
by the angel of death #

50
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,767
# And I'll be damned if he be the cause
of my last breath #

51
00:03:29,842 --> 00:03:33,175
# My man Proctor says, "This dumbass
nigga should start wearing a vest" #

52
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:35,544
# Only to test my niggas
in the terrace #

53
00:03:35,615 --> 00:03:37,105
# Who came here
to put his ass to rest #

54
00:03:37,183 --> 00:03:39,777
# Yo, I suggest
he take my best advice #

55
00:03:39,852 --> 00:03:41,513
# Before he speaks once,
he better think twice #

56
00:03:41,588 --> 00:03:43,522
# Ain't it nice
in the terra-dome #

57
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:46,081
# The streets where the big-mouth cat
no longer moves #

58
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,457
# Y'all leave the street now, big mouth,
you better take a seat now #

59
00:03:48,528 --> 00:03:50,962
# If you speak foul, you'll get
smacked up with the heat now #

60
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:53,225
# Keep it discreet
on the concrete now #

61
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:55,790
# Kick all 100 feet,
catching a beatdown. #

62
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:04,101
Man, you were
fucking awesome, man.

63
00:04:04,177 --> 00:04:06,441
That guy was talking
so much shit,

64
00:04:06,512 --> 00:04:08,946
and you put on
a fucking clinic.

65
00:04:09,015 --> 00:04:10,949
But it looks like
he got you a little bit.

66
00:04:11,017 --> 00:04:13,212
- What's wrong with you, man?
- Easy easy.

67
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:14,947
Man, what did dad
used to say?

68
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:16,921
Walk it off.

69
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:18,753
What'd we clear anyway?

70
00:04:18,825 --> 00:04:20,918
Two Gs for the winner.

71
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:23,428
Two? Man, it's got to be
more than that.

72
00:04:23,496 --> 00:04:26,488
There is, there is.
Don't shit yourself.

73
00:04:26,566 --> 00:04:28,591
I got to give
Ganz's cut first.

74
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,401
Okay, well,
I'll go with you.

75
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:34,269
Huh-uh, no way, junior.

76
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,932
Plus I gotta
make a stop.

77
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:38,136
You didn't.

78
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:40,771
You did, didn't you?

79
00:04:40,847 --> 00:04:44,339
I told you you should have
put that money on me.

80
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:46,578
I love the ponies
better than you.

81
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:49,884
Plus after this
I'm straight.

82
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,890
Yeah, right.
I've heard that before.

83
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,425
It's cool, man.

84
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:55,427
All right?

85
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:57,087
Don't worry about it.

86
00:04:57,163 --> 00:05:00,496
You have got to go home
and get some sleep, killa.

87
00:05:00,566 --> 00:05:04,263
And then tomorrow morning we'll get
together and we'll do the split.

88
00:05:04,337 --> 00:05:05,929
Thank you.

89
00:05:06,005 --> 00:05:07,905
Huh-uh.

90
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:09,965
I love you, man.

91
00:05:12,412 --> 00:05:14,403
Go home.

92
00:06:41,934 --> 00:06:44,494
Are you Brandon?

93
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,902
I'm Detective Harris.
I was the one that spoke to you

94
00:06:46,973 --> 00:06:49,373
about your
brother's case.

95
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:56,439
These are your brother's
belongings.

96
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:04,289
Not much for a life,
is it?

97
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:05,619
What did Dad used to say?

98
00:07:07,026 --> 00:07:09,859
Listen, like I told you,

99
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:11,954
the guys that did this
were just out on parole

100
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:14,295
and killed a cab driver
the same night

101
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:17,928
before we
picked them up.

102
00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:19,938
The D.A. told me
this morning

103
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:22,338
the state's going to seek
the death penalty.

104
00:07:26,546 --> 00:07:28,309
I'm sorry.

105
00:07:30,683 --> 00:07:34,084
Hey...

106
00:07:34,153 --> 00:07:36,883
I gotta get going.

107
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:39,220
- Thank you.
- You take care.

108
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:04,240
We need to talk.

109
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:09,811
A nice place
you got here.

110
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:12,517
Sit.

111
00:08:14,193 --> 00:08:16,354
Sure, come in.

112
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:28,134
Now I know you just
lost your brother,

113
00:08:28,207 --> 00:08:30,732
God rest his soul,

114
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:32,641
but now we got to
talk business.

115
00:08:32,712 --> 00:08:34,407
When your brother
passed on,

116
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,948
he was carrying a large
amount of my money-

117
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:41,544
$60,000 to be exact.

118
00:08:41,621 --> 00:08:44,784
Now I know you want to do
the right thing here, Brandon,

119
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:49,294
so out of the kindness
of my heart

120
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:52,092
I'm gonna give you a week
for you to get me my money.

121
00:08:52,164 --> 00:08:53,654
There's no way
we took in that much.

122
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:56,463
You guys cleared
20 grand,

123
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:59,505
but Frankie was into me

124
00:08:59,572 --> 00:09:03,565
for another 40
from betting on the ponies.

125
00:09:03,643 --> 00:09:06,271
That makes 60

126
00:09:06,345 --> 00:09:08,438
you owe me.

127
00:09:08,514 --> 00:09:10,778
Where the hell am I supposed
to get that kind of money?

128
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:13,114
Oh, I don't know,
rob a bank, deal drugs,

129
00:09:13,185 --> 00:09:16,052
blow niggers on the corner. I don't give
a shit. Just get me my fucking money.

130
00:09:16,122 --> 00:09:17,521
That's fucking bull-

131
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:24,195
Let me put it
in focus for you,

132
00:09:24,263 --> 00:09:26,458
you little
piece of shit-

133
00:09:26,532 --> 00:09:29,092
either I get
my fucking money

134
00:09:29,168 --> 00:09:32,103
or you're gonna be another
shit stain on the wall.

135
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:38,704
Picture that
for a moment.

136
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:41,476
Got it?

137
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:46,147
You got a week.

138
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:12,400
# I didn't really
even know #

139
00:10:12,478 --> 00:10:15,879
# To notice you went out
of your way to find a way #

140
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:18,917
# Inside someone,
feel better about yourself #

141
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:21,412
# I didn't care
to know your name #

142
00:10:21,487 --> 00:10:24,251
# But you made it a point
to try to dump mine #

143
00:10:24,323 --> 00:10:28,350
# And then the words slip #

144
00:10:28,427 --> 00:10:30,554
# Try my best
to find a way #

145
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:34,031
# To will this
bullshit past aside #

146
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,261
# Run through #

147
00:10:36,335 --> 00:10:37,802
# So hey #

148
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:39,929
# Don't you run away
from me #

149
00:10:40,006 --> 00:10:42,236
# So I can see
your face #

150
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:47,245
# I can lay a fortune
on the floor #

151
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:49,304
# Seems like you've found
your place #

152
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:51,441
# On a torture raid #

153
00:10:51,517 --> 00:10:54,975
# Now you're laying a fortune
on the floor #

154
00:10:55,054 --> 00:10:57,249
# You're bleeding #

155
00:10:57,323 --> 00:11:00,121
# Yeah yeah yeah yeah #

156
00:11:00,192 --> 00:11:03,184
# I didn't think
to realize #

157
00:11:03,262 --> 00:11:05,560
# But I know... #

158
00:11:20,946 --> 00:11:23,210
Hold on!

159
00:11:28,287 --> 00:11:30,983
Can I come in?

160
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:33,252
Suit yourself.

161
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:42,362
So how have you been?

162
00:11:42,435 --> 00:11:43,732
All right.

163
00:11:43,803 --> 00:11:45,737
I can get around
a lot better now.

164
00:11:45,805 --> 00:11:47,830
Things would be great
if the government would

165
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:50,398
stop messing with my
disability checks.

166
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:52,410
16 years in the service-

167
00:11:52,478 --> 00:11:55,379
I got to beg 'em
for money to eat.

168
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:00,141
Maybe I can help out
a little bit.

169
00:12:07,693 --> 00:12:09,251
Plan on staying a while?

170
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:12,422
For a little bit, till I can figure
something out.

171
00:12:12,498 --> 00:12:14,090
Well, it's 500 a month.

172
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:15,463
Jesus.

173
00:12:15,534 --> 00:12:17,468
Uh...

174
00:12:17,536 --> 00:12:19,527
there'll be no blasphemy
in my house.

175
00:12:19,605 --> 00:12:21,800
I thought I taught
you boys that.

176
00:12:21,874 --> 00:12:23,466
Taught us?

177
00:12:23,542 --> 00:12:25,305
The only thing I remember
you teaching us

178
00:12:25,377 --> 00:12:27,641
is how to take a punch.

179
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:32,550
Did Frankie have
a nice funeral?

180
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,517
Yeah.

181
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:44,894
I took a picture
of his headstone.

182
00:12:44,964 --> 00:12:47,228
Would have been nice
to see you there.

183
00:13:13,859 --> 00:13:16,794
You can bunk
in the spare bedroom.

184
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:59,232
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

185
00:13:59,305 --> 00:14:01,603
Hey hey, that's not
how I taught you.

186
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:03,073
We say grace.

187
00:14:08,214 --> 00:14:11,047
Father of mercy,
full of grace,

188
00:14:11,116 --> 00:14:13,050
we humbly thank you

189
00:14:13,118 --> 00:14:15,678
for this bounty
we are about to receive.

190
00:14:15,754 --> 00:14:19,713
And please
watch over my son

191
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:22,283
and lead him not astray.

192
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:24,022
Amen.

193
00:14:28,801 --> 00:14:30,962
You know, if you're
looking for work,

194
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:32,970
I have a friend of mine

195
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:37,065
that's doing some construction
that needs some help.

196
00:14:37,142 --> 00:14:38,837
I'll give him a call.

197
00:14:38,911 --> 00:14:41,106
Am I looking for work?

198
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:43,580
Well, you're not sitting
around here all day.

199
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:45,617
That's my job.

200
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:50,052
Now I told you guys
you gotta wear gloves, didn't I

201
00:14:50,122 --> 00:14:52,283
Didn't I tell you that?
Take them to the foreman

202
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:54,849
and get them some gloves,
all right? Thank you.

203
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:57,725
- You must be Brandon.
- Yes, sir.

204
00:14:57,796 --> 00:14:59,787
I've heard a lot about you
from your dad.

205
00:14:59,865 --> 00:15:01,628
I am sorry to hear
about your brother.

206
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:02,894
Thanks.

207
00:15:02,968 --> 00:15:05,061
You ever stack palettes?

208
00:15:05,137 --> 00:15:06,297
No, not really.

209
00:15:06,372 --> 00:15:08,431
Well, it's real
complicated.

210
00:15:08,507 --> 00:15:10,998
You see those?
You're on cleanup.

211
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:13,169
Those have to be moved
from there over to there

212
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:16,237
so they can be loaded up
and hauled off-site.

213
00:15:16,315 --> 00:15:19,751
And you are to wear these
at all times, understand?

214
00:15:19,818 --> 00:15:21,752
At all times.

215
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:24,721
I don't want any fines in case
the OSHA inspector drops by.

216
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:28,317
If you can hack it,
I'll take you on full-time.

217
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:31,295
If you can't, I'll fire
your ass just as quick.

218
00:15:31,363 --> 00:15:32,990
Friend or no friend,

219
00:15:33,065 --> 00:15:35,124
that's my name on the sign.
All right?

220
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,690
Understood.

221
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:39,636
Okay, well, get to it.

222
00:15:39,705 --> 00:15:41,935
- We're burning daylight.
- Thanks.

223
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:18,137
Hey.

224
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:20,770
- I'm Todd.
- Brandon.

225
00:16:20,846 --> 00:16:22,438
First day here?

226
00:16:22,514 --> 00:16:24,948
Yeah, the longest one
of my life.

227
00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:27,815
If you think it's bad now,
you should try living in this hellhole.

228
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:33,147
You new to town, right?

229
00:16:33,225 --> 00:16:35,056
Does it really
show that much?

230
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:36,594
A little.

231
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:39,756
Yeah, my dad moved here,
so I'm staying with him for a bit.

232
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:41,857
Cool.

233
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:43,629
Been into town yet?

234
00:16:44,937 --> 00:16:47,599
So that stop sign back there
is your town?

235
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:50,005
Is that all of it?

236
00:16:50,075 --> 00:16:51,667
Don't let it
fool you, man.

237
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:54,474
There's some crazy shit
goes on around here after dark.

238
00:16:54,546 --> 00:16:57,413
Oh really?
What, like naked cow tipping?

239
00:16:57,483 --> 00:16:59,383
No, man.

240
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:02,614
Look, you obviously need someone
to show you the sights, man.

241
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:04,656
- I'll hook you up.
- Appreciate that, man.

242
00:17:04,723 --> 00:17:07,886
So what do you guys do around here
on a Friday night anyway?

243
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,921
Funny you should ask.

244
00:17:16,668 --> 00:17:18,863
So there is
life after dark around here.

245
00:17:18,937 --> 00:17:20,461
Man, totally.

246
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,676
Who's that?

247
00:17:24,743 --> 00:17:27,678
Oh, that's Erin Dean.

248
00:17:27,746 --> 00:17:30,772
She's, like, perfect.

249
00:17:30,849 --> 00:17:32,612
She's also untouchable.

250
00:17:32,684 --> 00:17:34,652
Bro, there's no chick
untouchable.

251
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,449
Seriously, dude.

252
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:40,390
Do not pass go.
Do not collect $200, man.

253
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:42,393
I'm telling you,
she's got this brother

254
00:17:42,461 --> 00:17:44,554
who's like a grade-A
psycho hillbilly, all right?

255
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:47,098
He's roughed up more than
a few guys who've tried to tap that ass.

256
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:50,101
Bro, I can handle myself.
I'll be back.

257
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:52,137
All right, man,
it's your funeral.

258
00:17:57,209 --> 00:17:58,608
Hey there.

259
00:17:58,677 --> 00:17:59,837
- Hi.
- Hi.

260
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,903
- I'm Brandon.
- Erin.

261
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:04,642
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

262
00:18:04,716 --> 00:18:08,015
I'm super fucking drunk.
I can't even see straight.

263
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:09,850
But then she pulls
the whole, like,

264
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:12,686
"No no no, it's okay. I'm gonna
take care of you. " And I'm like-

265
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:14,692
Looks like your sister's
got a new friend.

266
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,092
Haven't seen
that dude before.

267
00:18:17,162 --> 00:18:19,630
Fuck that.

268
00:18:19,698 --> 00:18:21,632
You're not from here,
are you?

269
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,634
How can you tell?

270
00:18:23,702 --> 00:18:26,865
Well, I haven't
seen you here before...

271
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:29,271
We gotta go. We gotta go.
Hey, Erin.

272
00:18:29,341 --> 00:18:31,571
- Dude, what the fuck?
- We should go now.

273
00:18:31,643 --> 00:18:33,338
I told you about it.
We should go.

274
00:18:33,412 --> 00:18:35,846
- Where are you from?
- I'm from all over.

275
00:18:35,914 --> 00:18:38,314
- Really?
- Yeah.

276
00:18:38,383 --> 00:18:41,045
Hey, kids.

277
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,951
Hey, man.

278
00:18:45,757 --> 00:18:49,420
Um, what the fuck
do you think you're doing?

279
00:18:49,495 --> 00:18:50,860
Victor, come on,
stop it.

280
00:18:50,929 --> 00:18:52,123
Come on, just stop.

281
00:18:52,197 --> 00:18:53,289
- Stay out of this.
- No.

282
00:18:53,365 --> 00:18:55,299
Do you not speak?

283
00:18:55,367 --> 00:18:57,335
- I'm not staying out-
- Oh, you're a funny guy, huh?

284
00:18:57,402 --> 00:18:59,393
- I am pretty fucking funny.
- No no.

285
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:01,769
Erin, go home.

286
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,331
- Go the fuck home.
- Whoa whoa, get your hands off her.

287
00:19:04,409 --> 00:19:06,206
- Get the fuck out of here.
- Get your hands off her.

288
00:19:06,278 --> 00:19:08,143
That's my fucking sister.
Who the fuck are you?

289
00:19:08,213 --> 00:19:11,011
If anybody's going home,
it's your bitch ass, motherfucker.

290
00:19:13,418 --> 00:19:16,751
What the fuck are you doing?
I don't need your fucking help.

291
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:22,851
Doves don't mate with crows,
motherfucker.

292
00:19:24,263 --> 00:19:26,561
Go back where you came from.

293
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:42,135
Some skinny kid brought you
home last night around 1:00,

294
00:19:42,214 --> 00:19:44,444
said you were in a fight
and got beat up.

295
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:47,041
I hope that other guy
looks worse than you.

296
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:49,053
Other guy? What other guy?
I don't even know who hit me.

297
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:50,588
I was just talking
to this girl,

298
00:19:50,656 --> 00:19:52,647
and next thing you know,
I'm waking up here.

299
00:19:52,724 --> 00:19:56,683
Whatever you're into, I don't want you
bringing it back to my doorstep.

300
00:19:56,762 --> 00:19:59,287
I already told you
it was a party.

301
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:03,095
"He who seeks trouble
always finds it"-

302
00:20:03,168 --> 00:20:05,864
Proverbs, chapter one.

303
00:20:05,938 --> 00:20:07,803
Yeah, thanks.
That helps.

304
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:11,900
Well, you'd be good
to think about it.

305
00:20:11,977 --> 00:20:15,572
Just what I need-
a fucking bible lesson.

306
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:28,521
I thought you'd be taking a week off
after that beating you took.

307
00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:30,459
Man, hell no.

308
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:33,089
My old man won't let you
lay around the house.

309
00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:36,293
I want to thank you though
for getting me home last night.

310
00:20:36,368 --> 00:20:38,336
No problem, man.

311
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:41,998
You looked pretty jacked up.
I was afraid you were dead or something.

312
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:45,043
How did you know where my
old man's place was anyway?

313
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:47,044
I checked your wallet.

314
00:20:47,112 --> 00:20:49,046
I was looking for number
or something

315
00:20:49,114 --> 00:20:51,275
and found a piece of paper
with an address on it.

316
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:54,513
So I just took a chance
and cruised you out there.

317
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:56,110
Appreciate it.

318
00:20:56,188 --> 00:20:58,247
Yeah, no sweat, man.

319
00:20:58,323 --> 00:21:01,486
Oh, and I sneaked a 20
out of your wallet for gas.

320
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,960
You little bastard.

321
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:07,531
Just stay busy
today, man,

322
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:09,260
'cause I heard Garret's
was a bad mood

323
00:21:09,334 --> 00:21:11,598
after losing a wad of cash
at the fights Saturday.

324
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:13,467
Fights?
What fights?

325
00:21:13,538 --> 00:21:15,335
Underground.

326
00:21:15,407 --> 00:21:16,965
We've got a fight club
scene here.

327
00:21:17,042 --> 00:21:19,533
Are you fucking
kidding me?

328
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:21,841
Like real fights?
Money fights?

329
00:21:21,913 --> 00:21:25,781
Nah, we just sit around
and trade chickens.

330
00:21:25,851 --> 00:21:28,649
Yeah, real money fights, man.
We're not that hillbilly.

331
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:34,681
Well, some of us are.

332
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,318
Man, I want in.

333
00:21:36,395 --> 00:21:37,919
Oh yeah?
You like to gamble?

334
00:21:37,996 --> 00:21:40,760
Not really.
I'd rather fight.

335
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:44,735
What?

336
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:47,966
Bro, you didn't do so good
the other night, remember?

337
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:51,168
You want to climb in the ring
with those guys? They'll smear you.

338
00:21:51,243 --> 00:21:53,108
That one dude
that stomped you-

339
00:21:53,178 --> 00:21:55,510
that's Victor, man.
He's the top dog.

340
00:21:57,582 --> 00:21:59,709
Man, that wasn't
a fucking fight.

341
00:21:59,785 --> 00:22:01,776
Come on.

342
00:22:01,853 --> 00:22:05,084
I'm gonna fight his little ass.
You'd better believe that.

343
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:07,182
Man, if you're crazy enough
to get in the ring,

344
00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:08,920
you'll get your chance.

345
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:10,894
Just make sure
your insurance is paid up.

346
00:22:10,962 --> 00:22:13,897
Man, whatever.
Just set it up.

347
00:22:13,965 --> 00:22:16,661
All right.

348
00:22:16,735 --> 00:22:19,465
There's some fairgrounds
about five miles from here

349
00:22:19,538 --> 00:22:21,199
on the other side
of the highway.

350
00:22:21,273 --> 00:22:24,106
Meet me there
tomorrow night.

351
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:27,009
And don't embarrass me
by getting your ass kicked again, okay?

352
00:22:39,324 --> 00:22:41,019
Let's go, man.

353
00:22:41,093 --> 00:22:44,358
I want to get some bets in
before I go.

354
00:22:44,429 --> 00:22:46,294
Look at this.
This is nice.

355
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:48,299
All right, come on.

356
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:51,268
The wet T-shirt contest
is on!

357
00:22:51,336 --> 00:22:56,069
All right, it's time
to get wet.

358
00:22:57,509 --> 00:22:59,340
Wet it.
Wet it.

359
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:03,480
They set up
all sort of fights-

360
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:05,914
different weight divisions,
everything.

361
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:07,918
I've seen guys
come in here with 50 bucks

362
00:23:07,986 --> 00:23:10,011
and leave
with five grand.

363
00:23:19,631 --> 00:23:21,622
Look who it is.

364
00:23:28,173 --> 00:23:30,733
I'm going to grab a beer.
You want anything?

365
00:23:30,809 --> 00:23:32,299
Yeah yeah.

366
00:23:32,377 --> 00:23:35,278
Just be back quick, man.
The next fight's in five.

367
00:23:36,314 --> 00:23:37,906
Oh yeah.

368
00:23:37,983 --> 00:23:39,780
What a wet t-shirt.

369
00:23:39,851 --> 00:23:41,785
Oh, wet it up,
wet it up.

370
00:23:41,853 --> 00:23:44,754
Look at you.
Go, girl.

371
00:23:56,701 --> 00:23:57,793
Whoa.

372
00:23:57,869 --> 00:23:59,496
Brandon.
Oh my God,

373
00:23:59,571 --> 00:24:02,438
I'm so sorry.
I was so worried about you.

374
00:24:02,507 --> 00:24:04,407
Are you okay?
How is your head?

375
00:24:04,476 --> 00:24:06,671
Yeah, I'm okay.

376
00:24:06,745 --> 00:24:08,212
I'm so sorry.

377
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,373
I don't even know how to apologize
for something like that.

378
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:12,883
Don't worry about that.
It's not your fault.

379
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:15,442
You do owe me though.

380
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,920
- Do I?
- Yes, you do.

381
00:24:17,989 --> 00:24:21,254
And what do I owe you?

382
00:24:21,326 --> 00:24:24,124
A chance to get
to know you better,

383
00:24:24,196 --> 00:24:27,927
maybe a dinner
and a movie.

384
00:24:27,999 --> 00:24:30,024
I need a beer.

385
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:33,434
That one's for you.

386
00:24:33,505 --> 00:24:34,938
Thank you.
Cheers.

387
00:24:35,006 --> 00:24:36,496
Cheers.

388
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:41,036
Hello hello.

389
00:24:42,914 --> 00:24:45,314
$50 on Victor.

390
00:24:48,553 --> 00:24:50,043
How are you doing today?

391
00:24:50,121 --> 00:24:51,349
I'm very well.
I'm very well.

392
00:24:51,423 --> 00:24:53,357
I'll be better
after Victor wins.

393
00:24:53,425 --> 00:24:56,826
You got it, right?
Am I on the board?

394
00:24:56,895 --> 00:24:59,728
- Yeah.
- Cool.

395
00:24:59,798 --> 00:25:01,732
So I thought I'd come home
for a while,

396
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,030
you know, to get
my head together.

397
00:25:04,102 --> 00:25:05,763
And then you met me.

398
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:08,397
And then I met you.

399
00:25:08,473 --> 00:25:10,907
That's the part
of the story that I like.

400
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:14,077
Yeah, me too.

401
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:18,782
So I gotta get going.
Excuse me, do you have a pen?

402
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:21,182
What? Where are you going?
They fights haven't even started.

403
00:25:21,253 --> 00:25:24,120
Yeah, I know.

404
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:26,521
I'm late for my shift
at work.

405
00:25:26,591 --> 00:25:28,559
I was just stopping by
to drop of my brother.

406
00:25:28,627 --> 00:25:31,790
His car's in the shop.

407
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:34,593
Don't worry.
He's in the ring.

408
00:25:34,666 --> 00:25:35,860
Yeah, that's him.

409
00:25:35,934 --> 00:25:37,424
You don't want
to watch the fight?

410
00:25:37,502 --> 00:25:39,129
Nope.

411
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:45,472
Yeah, but anyway,
call me.

412
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:48,980
Yeah, that's for sure.
You can count on that.

413
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:51,174
Good.

414
00:25:51,249 --> 00:25:54,685
All right,
so I'll see you later.

415
00:25:54,753 --> 00:25:57,187
Do me a favor,

416
00:25:57,255 --> 00:25:59,246
stay away from him.

417
00:25:59,324 --> 00:26:02,088
He's not right
in the head.

418
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,957
And call me.

419
00:26:09,801 --> 00:26:11,860
Questions?
Touch him up, touch him down.

420
00:26:11,937 --> 00:26:13,905
Now back up.

421
00:26:13,972 --> 00:26:16,770
Ready?
Ready?

422
00:26:16,841 --> 00:26:18,172
Fight.

423
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:20,711
# My life #

424
00:26:20,779 --> 00:26:23,270
# This rage #

425
00:26:30,622 --> 00:26:34,353
# Made to crawl
through broken glass #

426
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:37,918
# A prisoner of
a jaded past #

427
00:26:37,996 --> 00:26:41,625
# A helping hand
out of reach #

428
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:45,227
# Forget what they tell you,
forget what they preach #

429
00:26:45,303 --> 00:26:49,899
# Oh yeah, this rage,
my life... #

430
00:26:49,975 --> 00:26:51,738
That's it.

431
00:26:53,979 --> 00:26:56,106
Yes! Yes!

432
00:26:56,181 --> 00:26:59,446
That's Jason.
He's the guy that bottled you.

433
00:26:59,517 --> 00:27:01,007
Yeah.

434
00:27:01,086 --> 00:27:03,077
Yes! You're the man!

435
00:27:03,154 --> 00:27:05,122
You are the man!

436
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:07,624
Yeah! Whoo!

437
00:27:07,692 --> 00:27:09,489
Love it!

438
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,601
This looks like
it could be good.

439
00:27:24,843 --> 00:27:27,505
Holy shit.
That's Drake Colby.

440
00:27:27,579 --> 00:27:29,171
Who?

441
00:27:29,247 --> 00:27:31,511
Drake Colby.
He's a fucking legend, bro.

442
00:27:31,583 --> 00:27:33,517
He dropped out of sight
years ago.

443
00:27:33,585 --> 00:27:35,712
Dude, bet it all.

444
00:27:35,787 --> 00:27:38,187
Bet it all on Drake Colby,
seriously.

445
00:27:38,256 --> 00:27:39,450
Go.

446
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:43,817
All right, guys, they came to watch
you fight, not the referee.

447
00:27:43,895 --> 00:27:46,295
You know the rules.
Any questions?

448
00:27:46,364 --> 00:27:48,298
All right, touch him up,
touch him down.

449
00:27:48,366 --> 00:27:50,596
Step back.

450
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:52,603
You ready?

451
00:27:53,638 --> 00:27:54,900
You ready?

452
00:27:54,973 --> 00:27:56,201
Fight!

453
00:28:13,725 --> 00:28:16,193
# Let's end this life #

454
00:28:16,261 --> 00:28:18,695
# With a bloody
knife fight #

455
00:28:18,763 --> 00:28:21,027
# Let's end this life #

456
00:28:21,099 --> 00:28:23,090
# With a bloody
knife fight... #

457
00:28:35,013 --> 00:28:36,480
We're set.

458
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:40,142
#... I got my blade,
switchblade switchblade #

459
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:42,311
# I got my blade,
switchblade switchblade #

460
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:44,321
# Let's end this life #

461
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:46,755
# With a bloody
knife fight #

462
00:28:46,825 --> 00:28:49,487
# Let's end this life #

463
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:51,586
# With a bloody
knife fight #

464
00:28:51,663 --> 00:28:54,257
# Let's end this life #

465
00:28:54,332 --> 00:28:56,562
# With a bloody
knife fight #

466
00:28:56,634 --> 00:28:58,932
# Let's end this life #

467
00:28:59,003 --> 00:29:00,994
# With a bloody
knife fight... #

468
00:29:10,949 --> 00:29:12,507
That's it.
That's it.

469
00:29:24,395 --> 00:29:26,693
#... Let's end this life. #

470
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:35,838
Brandon, bro.

471
00:29:37,976 --> 00:29:39,910
Dude, I've got your cash.

472
00:29:39,978 --> 00:29:42,071
Okay, I'll catch up
with you later.

473
00:29:43,181 --> 00:29:45,149
Uh, yeah, man.

474
00:29:54,526 --> 00:29:57,859
Hey, where's the money?

475
00:29:57,929 --> 00:29:59,863
- For fuck's sake.
- Come on.

476
00:29:59,931 --> 00:30:03,059
Hey hey, keep calm, all right?
Don't do anything stupid.

477
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:04,999
Prize money.
Come on.

478
00:30:05,069 --> 00:30:07,060
Hey!

479
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:13,944
Nice.

480
00:30:19,083 --> 00:30:21,017
So I take it
you're a fighter then.

481
00:30:21,085 --> 00:30:23,519
Yeah. Man, I used to
watch you on TV all the time.

482
00:30:23,588 --> 00:30:24,816
You're a goddamned legend.

483
00:30:24,889 --> 00:30:27,517
I don't know about legend.
That was a long time ago.

484
00:30:27,592 --> 00:30:29,685
Oh, not to me, bro.

485
00:30:29,761 --> 00:30:31,353
You're Drake Colby.

486
00:30:31,429 --> 00:30:33,920
Hey hey, keep it down.
Keep it down, all right?

487
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:37,058
I'm trying to keep
a low profile around here.

488
00:30:37,135 --> 00:30:39,433
All right, listen,
I think I owe you a beer.

489
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:41,870
- Want a beer?
- Yeah, sure.

490
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:44,704
Come on, man.
Asshole!

491
00:30:44,776 --> 00:30:47,244
- Let's go.
- Okay.

492
00:30:52,483 --> 00:30:55,213
Here.

493
00:31:03,962 --> 00:31:05,896
How bad is it?

494
00:31:05,964 --> 00:31:07,261
It ain't good.

495
00:31:07,332 --> 00:31:10,529
Either I hit too hard
or these hands are too soft.

496
00:31:10,602 --> 00:31:14,129
Either way I'm not having
these fights I've got booked.

497
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:16,002
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

498
00:31:16,074 --> 00:31:17,666
I really needed
that money.

499
00:31:17,742 --> 00:31:19,334
Maybe we can
help each other out.

500
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:21,037
Really?
How?

501
00:31:21,112 --> 00:31:23,842
What if you put me in
as a replacement?

502
00:31:23,915 --> 00:31:26,042
We'll split the winnings
down the middle, 50/50.

503
00:31:26,117 --> 00:31:28,585
You're a confident
little bastard, aren't you?

504
00:31:28,653 --> 00:31:30,814
Well, you know, fair enough.
I like your style.

505
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:34,188
Um, all right.

506
00:31:34,259 --> 00:31:37,956
These guys might be hicks,
but they know how to fight.

507
00:31:38,029 --> 00:31:40,361
Yeah, let me worry
about that.

508
00:31:40,431 --> 00:31:43,025
Okay okay, tough guy.

509
00:31:43,101 --> 00:31:45,035
No problem.

510
00:31:45,103 --> 00:31:47,435
But we're gonna need $5000
to get the ball rolling.

511
00:31:47,505 --> 00:31:48,767
That's the buy-in.

512
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,774
I have a few thousand
stashed.

513
00:31:50,842 --> 00:31:53,106
Okay, well, as I said,
we need $5000.

514
00:31:53,177 --> 00:31:54,769
We're going to need
$3000 more.

515
00:31:54,846 --> 00:31:56,814
I was hoping for
the "knockout of the night"

516
00:31:56,881 --> 00:31:58,576
but I smashed
my hand up.

517
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:00,277
I had to settle
for the submission.

518
00:32:00,351 --> 00:32:02,751
So you don't have any
to kick in?

519
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:06,722
I haven't got two pennies
to rub together, seriously.

520
00:32:06,791 --> 00:32:09,521
I don't live here because
I'm an eccentric millionaire.

521
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:11,425
Yeah, I wanted to ask you
about that.

522
00:32:11,496 --> 00:32:13,430
What are you doing
living out here

523
00:32:13,498 --> 00:32:15,398
in the middle
of fucking nowhere?

524
00:32:15,466 --> 00:32:17,798
Fucking hell, man.
What's with all the questions?

525
00:32:17,869 --> 00:32:22,499
We've just met. What, are you a fucking
policeman or something?

526
00:32:22,573 --> 00:32:24,336
So how are we gonna get
the rest of the cash?

527
00:32:24,409 --> 00:32:26,877
I'll have to work
on that.

528
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:29,846
All right, you do that.

529
00:32:29,914 --> 00:32:31,848
And when you've got it,
come and see me.

530
00:32:31,916 --> 00:32:34,248
We can talk
some more then.

531
00:32:38,756 --> 00:32:40,781
So where are you gonna
get that $3000?

532
00:32:40,858 --> 00:32:42,792
I don't know.

533
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:44,885
I know my old man
doesn't have it.

534
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:47,397
He wouldn't lend it to me
if he did.

535
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:48,659
What about you?

536
00:32:48,733 --> 00:32:51,759
I just paid my phone bill.
I'm skint.

537
00:32:51,836 --> 00:32:55,738
Man, you're a tightass.
That's only like 100 bucks.

538
00:32:55,807 --> 00:33:00,574
No, bro, I just ran up
a $1000 phone sex bill.

539
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:03,011
I'm paying my mom back
right now, so I can't.

540
00:33:03,081 --> 00:33:05,015
Oh, you're one of those guys.

541
00:33:05,083 --> 00:33:07,517
I'm glad you find it funny.
Yeah yeah, laugh it up.

542
00:33:07,585 --> 00:33:09,519
Did you have a full
bottle of lotion?

543
00:33:09,587 --> 00:33:12,055
Fuck you, man.
Come on.

544
00:33:12,123 --> 00:33:14,785
Wow.

545
00:33:14,859 --> 00:33:16,793
You're serious?

546
00:33:16,861 --> 00:33:19,261
I think I know where
you can get the money.

547
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:20,820
Where is that?

548
00:33:20,898 --> 00:33:22,297
Him.

549
00:33:24,068 --> 00:33:25,365
- Garret?
- Yeah.

550
00:33:25,436 --> 00:33:27,131
He was at the fights,
wasn't he?

551
00:33:27,205 --> 00:33:29,696
He likes to gamble.

552
00:33:29,774 --> 00:33:32,208
- Yeah, but I don't know.
- But what, man?

553
00:33:32,276 --> 00:33:34,403
Come on, it's not like
he's gonna turn us in or something.

554
00:33:34,479 --> 00:33:37,642
Let's just-
let's ask him.

555
00:33:37,715 --> 00:33:39,649
I'll ask him.

556
00:33:39,717 --> 00:33:41,582
All right.

557
00:33:41,652 --> 00:33:43,085
You think he'll really
go for that?

558
00:33:43,154 --> 00:33:45,019
You think you can
make him some money?

559
00:33:45,089 --> 00:33:46,886
$3000? No. No way.

560
00:33:46,958 --> 00:33:48,585
Garret,
this could be huge.

561
00:33:48,659 --> 00:33:50,286
Have you ever
seen him fight?

562
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:52,727
Well...

563
00:33:52,797 --> 00:33:54,287
Yeah, that's what
I thought.

564
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:56,526
Look, I'm willing to put down
a couple hundred,

565
00:33:56,601 --> 00:33:58,626
but $3000- no.

566
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:01,035
Listen, if I lose your money,
I'll work for free.

567
00:34:01,105 --> 00:34:04,131
What do I get
for my money?

568
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:06,142
50% of my cut.

569
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:08,201
Does your daddy know
about this?

570
00:34:08,279 --> 00:34:12,272
No, and he shouldn't either.
You know what I mean?

571
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:13,977
All right.

572
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:15,542
I'll tell you
what I'll to do.

573
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:17,520
I know a couple
of local guys.

574
00:34:17,588 --> 00:34:19,522
I'll set that fight up
for here,

575
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:21,148
Friday after work.

576
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:23,819
If you win,
the money's yours.

577
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:26,363
If not, you're gonna
be shoveling

578
00:34:26,431 --> 00:34:28,831
a lot of dirt
this summer.

579
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,767
- Deal?
- Sounds like a deal.

580
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:41,137
Hey, what's up, Drake?

581
00:34:41,212 --> 00:34:43,874
- Hey.
- How's the hand?

582
00:34:43,948 --> 00:34:47,111
Eh, feels like it's full
of broken glass, to be honest.

583
00:34:47,185 --> 00:34:49,119
What are you doing
chopping wood?

584
00:34:49,187 --> 00:34:51,280
That's a good question.
I think it must help me

585
00:34:51,355 --> 00:34:53,289
forget my financial
problems.

586
00:34:53,357 --> 00:34:55,291
Talking of which,

587
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:57,293
did you get
the rest of the money?

588
00:34:57,361 --> 00:34:58,760
Not exactly.

589
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:00,764
I have somebody who's
willing to put it up.

590
00:35:00,832 --> 00:35:02,766
So what's the problem?

591
00:35:02,834 --> 00:35:04,768
He wants
to see me fight.

592
00:35:04,836 --> 00:35:06,770
And how are we gonna
do that?

593
00:35:06,838 --> 00:35:09,568
It's already set up
for this Friday.

594
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,938
Sweet.
I'll be there.

595
00:35:23,754 --> 00:35:25,688
Did you get into
another fight?

596
00:35:25,756 --> 00:35:27,690
No.

597
00:35:27,758 --> 00:35:29,988
You gotta go to work
tomorrow.

598
00:35:30,061 --> 00:35:32,427
I don't want you
to get fired.

599
00:35:32,497 --> 00:35:34,931
Eat your dinner
and get some sleep.

600
00:35:34,999 --> 00:35:36,694
I can't.
I gotta make a phone call.

601
00:35:40,438 --> 00:35:43,930
Stop pushing me.
What's her name?

602
00:35:45,243 --> 00:35:47,336
What are you talking about?

603
00:35:48,713 --> 00:35:50,908
A man only misses dinner
for one reason.

604
00:36:11,068 --> 00:36:13,502
Hi, Erin.

605
00:36:13,571 --> 00:36:15,539
It's Brandon.

606
00:36:15,606 --> 00:36:18,200
I told you I'd call.

607
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:41,131
This is amazing.

608
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:43,133
Yeah, it is.

609
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:46,602
Yeah, I sometimes come
over here after work

610
00:36:46,671 --> 00:36:49,105
just to get away.

611
00:36:49,173 --> 00:36:51,664
It helps me forget.

612
00:36:51,742 --> 00:36:54,210
About what?

613
00:36:54,278 --> 00:36:58,078
Life, things, people,

614
00:36:58,149 --> 00:37:00,777
my stepfather.

615
00:37:00,851 --> 00:37:03,581
What about your mother?

616
00:37:05,856 --> 00:37:08,347
She passed away
a couple of years ago.

617
00:37:08,426 --> 00:37:10,360
I'm sorry.

618
00:37:10,428 --> 00:37:12,362
It's okay.

619
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:14,364
She was sick
for a really long time

620
00:37:14,432 --> 00:37:17,799
and in the end it was
almost like a blessing, you know?

621
00:37:17,868 --> 00:37:21,031
Was it cancer?

622
00:37:21,105 --> 00:37:23,039
Yeah.

623
00:37:23,107 --> 00:37:25,041
Yeah, my mom too.

624
00:37:25,109 --> 00:37:27,043
Wow.

625
00:37:27,111 --> 00:37:30,603
So do you have any
brothers or sister?

626
00:37:32,116 --> 00:37:34,084
Uh...

627
00:37:35,786 --> 00:37:38,254
yeah, I had a brother.

628
00:37:38,322 --> 00:37:41,485
What happened?

629
00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:43,925
He was murdered.

630
00:37:48,065 --> 00:37:50,659
Oh my God, Brandon,
I'm really sorry.

631
00:37:53,671 --> 00:37:56,299
This is a romantic
conversation?

632
00:37:59,977 --> 00:38:04,038
Well, it's like my dad
would say, you know,

633
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:06,675
God gives you
what you can handle.

634
00:38:06,751 --> 00:38:09,083
I don't know.
Maybe there's a lesson

635
00:38:09,153 --> 00:38:11,621
to be learned
in all this.

636
00:38:11,689 --> 00:38:14,123
I just haven't
found it yet.

637
00:38:17,428 --> 00:38:19,623
You have something
on your-

638
00:38:21,399 --> 00:38:23,833
What was that for?

639
00:38:23,901 --> 00:38:27,530
'Cause I think
you're kind of beautiful.

640
00:38:27,605 --> 00:38:29,368
Beautiful?

641
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,964
Yeah,

642
00:38:31,042 --> 00:38:34,876
like a sensitive,
beautiful soul.

643
00:38:34,945 --> 00:38:37,209
Wow, that's a first.

644
00:38:39,617 --> 00:38:41,676
Thank you.

645
00:38:43,721 --> 00:38:46,053
Don't worry.
I won't tell anyone.

646
00:38:46,123 --> 00:38:48,455
That's our
little secret.

647
00:38:48,526 --> 00:38:51,859
Yeah.

648
00:38:51,929 --> 00:38:54,261
I guess it is.

649
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:56,823
You're beautiful
as well.

650
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:39,703
# Hearing your words
out of my mouth again #

651
00:39:39,777 --> 00:39:43,474
# Leaves me stuck
with the key to #

652
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:47,608
# All these reasons
you got in my head again #

653
00:39:47,685 --> 00:39:51,451
# Buried here
inside of me #

654
00:39:51,522 --> 00:39:53,786
# Return #

655
00:39:53,858 --> 00:39:57,658
# All of this to sender #

656
00:39:57,728 --> 00:40:02,097
# The mirror spoke to me
and showed #

657
00:40:02,166 --> 00:40:06,000
# All of this pretending #

658
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:08,402
# Is catching up to me #

659
00:40:08,472 --> 00:40:12,602
# Lights out, wake up,
stay calm, decide #

660
00:40:12,676 --> 00:40:16,806
# Reach up, stand
or be an eyesore #

661
00:40:16,881 --> 00:40:20,817
# Lights out, wake up,
stay calm, decide #

662
00:40:20,885 --> 00:40:24,946
# Reach up, stand
or be an eyesore. #

663
00:40:41,806 --> 00:40:44,206
Aw fuck.

664
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:47,904
Dude, I think too late
to run, bro.

665
00:40:47,978 --> 00:40:50,503
Shut up.
I'm gonna enjoy this.

666
00:40:50,581 --> 00:40:53,015
All right,
let's get to it.

667
00:40:53,083 --> 00:40:54,243
You want time
to warm up?

668
00:40:54,318 --> 00:40:56,786
I don't need time to warm up
to drop this punk.

669
00:40:56,854 --> 00:40:59,049
Okay, the first man down
is out.

670
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:00,886
Ready?

671
00:41:04,595 --> 00:41:06,324
Ready?

672
00:41:09,567 --> 00:41:11,034
Fight!

673
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:47,694
I got this today.

674
00:41:49,974 --> 00:41:52,636
What?

675
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:56,737
The detective that was
handling Frankie's case.

676
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:08,291
It's Frankie's
death certificate.

677
00:42:09,827 --> 00:42:13,422
Ashes to ashes,
dust to dust.

678
00:42:13,497 --> 00:42:16,830
It's almost as if
God ordained Frankie-

679
00:42:16,901 --> 00:42:18,926
Bullshit.

680
00:42:19,003 --> 00:42:20,994
Fucking bullshit.

681
00:42:21,071 --> 00:42:23,005
Don't you dare.

682
00:42:23,073 --> 00:42:24,631
God?

683
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:28,075
What does God have
to do with anything?

684
00:42:28,145 --> 00:42:30,340
If He was in charge...

685
00:42:33,584 --> 00:42:36,417
why did He let Frankie
get killed that way?

686
00:42:36,487 --> 00:42:39,752
He put you
in that chair?

687
00:42:50,634 --> 00:42:53,364
And Mom?

688
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:58,267
Why did He let her
get cancer?

689
00:43:00,945 --> 00:43:02,242
Huh?

690
00:43:02,313 --> 00:43:05,077
Tell me.

691
00:43:05,149 --> 00:43:07,083
Answer me.

692
00:43:07,151 --> 00:43:09,619
You can't, can you?

693
00:43:12,189 --> 00:43:15,647
Can you?

694
00:43:15,726 --> 00:43:17,660
All you can do
is give me

695
00:43:17,728 --> 00:43:20,492
those bullshit
religious sayings...

696
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:27,794
so you don't have to
feel anything...

697
00:43:32,576 --> 00:43:35,636
so you don't have to
really talk to me.

698
00:43:35,713 --> 00:43:37,647
I am talking to you.

699
00:43:37,715 --> 00:43:40,240
You just don't want to hear
what I have to say.

700
00:43:40,317 --> 00:43:42,376
That's not fair.

701
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:44,387
Fair?

702
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:46,855
Life's not fair.

703
00:43:48,792 --> 00:43:50,726
Frankie's dead,

704
00:43:50,794 --> 00:43:52,989
and no amount of talking
is gonna bring him back.

705
00:43:53,063 --> 00:43:56,089
So you might as well
get used to it.

706
00:43:56,166 --> 00:43:58,157
You fucking bastard.

707
00:43:58,235 --> 00:44:00,533
You're right.

708
00:44:00,604 --> 00:44:03,471
I am a fucking bastard.

709
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:06,634
So what are you gonna
do about it?

710
00:44:08,912 --> 00:44:11,380
Are you gonna come over
and hit me?

711
00:44:11,448 --> 00:44:15,179
Come on, you've been
waiting your whole life.

712
00:44:15,252 --> 00:44:18,346
I'm in a chair.
Come on and hit me.

713
00:44:18,422 --> 00:44:20,390
I'm not going anywhere.

714
00:44:20,457 --> 00:44:22,925
Come over here
and hit me.

715
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:25,325
I'm in this chair.

716
00:44:25,396 --> 00:44:27,364
Now's your chance.

717
00:44:27,431 --> 00:44:29,865
So hit me.

718
00:44:32,603 --> 00:44:34,867
I'm nothing
fucking like you-

719
00:44:34,938 --> 00:44:37,702
nothing.

720
00:44:37,775 --> 00:44:40,300
I'm never gonna be
like you.

721
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:50,752
I'm not that little boy
anymore.

722
00:44:58,729 --> 00:45:00,663
Can I ask you
something?

723
00:45:00,731 --> 00:45:03,325
Yeah, what's up?

724
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:06,563
You ever thought
about just leaving,

725
00:45:06,637 --> 00:45:09,265
just packing
your bags

726
00:45:09,339 --> 00:45:13,070
and just go,
just leave?

727
00:45:13,143 --> 00:45:15,475
Like every day
of my life.

728
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:17,480
So why haven't you?

729
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:19,482
I don't know.

730
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:21,142
Come on.

731
00:45:21,218 --> 00:45:23,152
I don't know.
I don't know.

732
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:25,745
It's-
I'm scared.

733
00:45:25,823 --> 00:45:28,018
- Scared?
- Yeah.

734
00:45:28,092 --> 00:45:30,026
You?

735
00:45:30,094 --> 00:45:33,222
You're like the most confident person
I've ever met.

736
00:45:33,297 --> 00:45:35,322
It's very scary.

737
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:38,857
Besides,
where would I go?

738
00:45:38,936 --> 00:45:40,198
What would I do?

739
00:45:40,270 --> 00:45:42,238
Anything you wanted to.

740
00:45:45,943 --> 00:45:49,470
Do me a favor,
close your eyes.

741
00:45:49,546 --> 00:45:50,979
Trust me.

742
00:45:51,048 --> 00:45:53,482
They're closed.

743
00:45:55,285 --> 00:45:57,219
Pretend that you can
go anywhere,

744
00:45:57,287 --> 00:45:59,221
do anything.

745
00:45:59,289 --> 00:46:01,780
Where would you go?
What would you do?

746
00:46:04,795 --> 00:46:07,263
I'm right where
I want to be.

747
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:15,705
You know what's funny?

748
00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:17,707
When I was a kid

749
00:46:17,775 --> 00:46:20,938
I used to have
the map of the world

750
00:46:21,011 --> 00:46:22,945
above my bed.

751
00:46:23,013 --> 00:46:25,413
And when I was
really upset,

752
00:46:25,482 --> 00:46:27,780
I would just point

753
00:46:27,851 --> 00:46:29,785
at various places-

754
00:46:29,853 --> 00:46:33,050
close my eyes
and just point.

755
00:46:33,123 --> 00:46:35,057
And I promised myself
that I would go

756
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:37,059
visit those places.

757
00:46:37,127 --> 00:46:40,893
And now I'm older

758
00:46:40,964 --> 00:46:44,365
and I'm still here
in this small little town

759
00:46:44,434 --> 00:46:48,200
and I've never visited
those places.

760
00:46:51,542 --> 00:46:54,602
But, you know,
the funny thing is

761
00:46:54,678 --> 00:46:56,612
you actually got out.

762
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:59,205
You made a decision
and you just went,

763
00:46:59,283 --> 00:47:01,717
you followed a dream.

764
00:47:01,785 --> 00:47:04,219
I really admire that.

765
00:47:06,890 --> 00:47:09,324
You make it sound
romantic.

766
00:47:09,393 --> 00:47:11,657
It is.

767
00:47:11,728 --> 00:47:14,219
Isn't it?

768
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:20,236
My dad- he's a real
son of a bitch.

769
00:47:20,304 --> 00:47:22,238
He used to make
me and brother fight

770
00:47:22,306 --> 00:47:24,740
in the backyard
every day.

771
00:47:24,808 --> 00:47:27,333
He would come home

772
00:47:27,411 --> 00:47:29,345
and drink a beer
and watch us

773
00:47:29,413 --> 00:47:33,042
beat the shit
out of each other.

774
00:47:35,853 --> 00:47:37,787
And one day
we just decided-

775
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:39,948
Why fight each other?

776
00:47:40,023 --> 00:47:42,457
Why fight for free?

777
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:44,551
So we just left.

778
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:53,765
What else is going on
in that head of yours?

779
00:47:53,837 --> 00:47:56,362
I don't know.

780
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:59,034
I just can't help
thinking

781
00:47:59,109 --> 00:48:01,043
that I should have
been there for him.

782
00:48:01,111 --> 00:48:03,602
I should have been
there for Frankie.

783
00:48:05,249 --> 00:48:07,843
What could you have done?

784
00:48:07,918 --> 00:48:10,614
I don't know,
just been there.

785
00:48:10,687 --> 00:48:13,349
I wake up

786
00:48:13,423 --> 00:48:16,984
and just think,

787
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:20,552
"Why the hell
didn't I go with him?"

788
00:48:20,631 --> 00:48:24,499
I should have fucking
went with him.

789
00:48:24,568 --> 00:48:28,060
And then maybe that would
have been you too.

790
00:48:28,138 --> 00:48:30,606
Yeah.

791
00:48:35,445 --> 00:48:37,913
But it haunts me.

792
00:48:37,981 --> 00:48:40,643
I hear him
calling my name

793
00:48:40,717 --> 00:48:45,086
just like
when we were kids.

794
00:48:45,155 --> 00:48:47,680
And I'm not there.

795
00:48:49,192 --> 00:48:53,094
Understand, I loved
my brother Frankie.

796
00:48:54,965 --> 00:48:58,867
We used to watch out
for each other,

797
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:01,530
especially around
the old man.

798
00:49:04,508 --> 00:49:06,442
Have you forgiven him?

799
00:49:06,510 --> 00:49:08,978
I just-

800
00:49:09,046 --> 00:49:11,708
I'm not afraid of him
anymore.

801
00:49:16,653 --> 00:49:18,587
So what are you gonna do?

802
00:49:18,655 --> 00:49:21,556
Are you gonna stay here?

803
00:49:27,531 --> 00:49:30,261
Would you stay here
for me?

804
00:50:06,336 --> 00:50:08,270
Hey, what's up?

805
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:10,704
Yeah, I understand.

806
00:50:10,774 --> 00:50:13,208
Saturday?

807
00:50:13,276 --> 00:50:15,210
Okay.

808
00:50:15,278 --> 00:50:17,712
All right, yeah.

809
00:50:17,781 --> 00:50:20,249
Okay, all right.

810
00:50:20,317 --> 00:50:22,308
For sure. Bye.

811
00:50:26,390 --> 00:50:29,018
Drake set it up
for Saturday.

812
00:50:29,092 --> 00:50:31,026
Sweet.
Good.

813
00:50:31,094 --> 00:50:33,358
Now I can get
some sleep.

814
00:50:33,430 --> 00:50:35,364
What?

815
00:50:35,432 --> 00:50:38,663
Garret, man- that guy has been
calling me every night

816
00:50:38,735 --> 00:50:40,600
wanting to know
when it's gonna happen.

817
00:50:40,670 --> 00:50:43,036
Dude, he hit me up
like three times today.

818
00:50:43,106 --> 00:50:45,404
He's freaking crazy.

819
00:51:06,063 --> 00:51:08,861
Stop for a minute.

820
00:51:10,567 --> 00:51:12,000
What?

821
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:14,936
This boy
Erin's seeing-

822
00:51:15,005 --> 00:51:17,098
do you know anything
about him?

823
00:51:20,811 --> 00:51:23,644
Yeah.

824
00:51:23,713 --> 00:51:26,773
He's-

825
00:51:26,850 --> 00:51:30,149
he's new in town.
He works for Garret.

826
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:32,245
He's a fighter?

827
00:51:32,322 --> 00:51:35,416
I guess so.

828
00:51:35,492 --> 00:51:36,857
Could you
deal with him?

829
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:41,329
I already have once.

830
00:51:41,398 --> 00:51:43,923
In the ring, smartass.

831
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,696
Yeah.

832
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:48,795
Why?

833
00:51:48,872 --> 00:51:52,000
The word's up

834
00:51:52,075 --> 00:51:54,009
somebody's trying
to book him

835
00:51:54,077 --> 00:51:56,739
some big
money fights.

836
00:51:56,813 --> 00:51:59,441
I was thinking of bringing
some of my friends in.

837
00:51:59,516 --> 00:52:02,451
But before I do,

838
00:52:02,519 --> 00:52:05,454
I want to make sure
you can take this guy.

839
00:52:14,564 --> 00:52:16,691
Set it up.

840
00:52:52,335 --> 00:52:53,859
This is it?

841
00:52:53,937 --> 00:52:55,871
What the fuck
were you expecting?

842
00:52:55,939 --> 00:52:57,873
It's a private bout.
Come on.

843
00:52:57,941 --> 00:53:00,307
This should be interesting.

844
00:53:13,423 --> 00:53:14,913
Howdy, fellas.

845
00:53:14,991 --> 00:53:17,016
- How's it going?
- Good.

846
00:53:17,093 --> 00:53:18,822
This your man?

847
00:53:18,895 --> 00:53:20,692
Yeah, this is Brandon.

848
00:53:20,764 --> 00:53:23,426
That's my boy Lonnie
over there.

849
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:24,831
You'll be fighting him.

850
00:53:24,901 --> 00:53:28,393
$5000 buy-in.
Winner takes all.

851
00:53:28,471 --> 00:53:30,962
- Here's ours.
- Here's ours.

852
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:33,601
- I'll hold the money.
- I don't think so.

853
00:53:33,677 --> 00:53:36,737
That ain't
very neighborly.

854
00:53:36,813 --> 00:53:38,144
Sorry.

855
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:41,013
Alrighty.

856
00:53:41,084 --> 00:53:43,985
But don't be getting any ideas
about skipping without paying,

857
00:53:44,054 --> 00:53:45,612
'cause we wouldn't
like that.

858
00:53:45,689 --> 00:53:48,487
You understand
what I'm saying, boy?

859
00:53:48,558 --> 00:53:51,789
You just have
yours ready, okay?

860
00:53:51,861 --> 00:53:54,352
All right.
Let's do this.

861
00:53:57,267 --> 00:53:59,326
- What do you know about this guy?
- Not too much.

862
00:53:59,402 --> 00:54:00,835
I have seen him
fight before.

863
00:54:00,904 --> 00:54:02,667
He's sloppy,
but he can hit.

864
00:54:02,739 --> 00:54:04,798
You should keep your hands up, okay?
Come on.

865
00:54:04,874 --> 00:54:07,707
Bring your man out.

866
00:54:09,212 --> 00:54:11,146
You boys shake hands.

867
00:54:11,214 --> 00:54:13,648
- Come on, B.
- On me.

868
00:54:13,717 --> 00:54:15,742
Fight!

869
00:54:15,819 --> 00:54:19,846
# Now you're gonna wake #

870
00:54:19,923 --> 00:54:23,222
# Up to the bleeding #

871
00:54:23,293 --> 00:54:24,726
# Get down, yeah #

872
00:54:24,794 --> 00:54:27,354
# Get down, there's a wildfire
in the streets #

873
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:31,059
# Now you cannot fake #

874
00:54:31,134 --> 00:54:34,729
# What you are feeding #

875
00:54:34,804 --> 00:54:36,294
# Get down, yeah #

876
00:54:36,373 --> 00:54:38,671
# Get down, there's a wildfire
in the streets #

877
00:54:53,890 --> 00:54:57,986
# Now you're gonna wake #

878
00:54:58,061 --> 00:55:01,292
# Up to the bleeding #

879
00:55:01,364 --> 00:55:02,831
# Get down, yeah #

880
00:55:02,899 --> 00:55:05,527
# Get down, there's a wildfire
in the streets #

881
00:55:05,602 --> 00:55:09,163
# Now you cannot fake #

882
00:55:09,239 --> 00:55:12,606
# What you are feeding #

883
00:55:12,676 --> 00:55:14,166
# Get down, yeah #

884
00:55:14,244 --> 00:55:16,974
# Get down, there's a wildfire
in the streets. #

885
00:55:17,047 --> 00:55:18,981
Oh, shit.

886
00:55:19,049 --> 00:55:20,983
I lost my
motherfucking money.

887
00:55:21,051 --> 00:55:23,178
All right, you and Todd
get ready to leave.

888
00:55:23,253 --> 00:55:25,278
I'm going to get
our money.

889
00:55:27,257 --> 00:55:30,283
Your boy's good, but-

890
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:31,952
Our money?

891
00:55:38,768 --> 00:55:40,929
Your choice.

892
00:55:42,572 --> 00:55:43,869
Take it.

893
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:46,636
It's a pleasure
doing business with you.

894
00:55:46,710 --> 00:55:49,338
Let's get the fuck
out of here.

895
00:55:59,456 --> 00:56:02,254
So this is what
$10,000 looks like?

896
00:56:02,325 --> 00:56:04,725
This is
fucking awesome.

897
00:56:04,794 --> 00:56:07,126
Well, listen, this is
just the beginning, boys.

898
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:09,222
Our next fight's
a 10-grand buy-in.

899
00:56:09,299 --> 00:56:11,597
- But I got a question.
- What's that, Todd?

900
00:56:11,668 --> 00:56:14,637
When do I get some?

901
00:56:14,704 --> 00:56:17,195
I want in.
I mean, I discovered him.

902
00:56:17,273 --> 00:56:20,299
This fucking guy. How would you like
to discover this?

903
00:56:20,377 --> 00:56:22,140
I'm serious.

904
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:24,806
Listen, fighting's all
about getting paid, yeah?

905
00:56:24,881 --> 00:56:26,542
These fights today-
these private fights

906
00:56:26,616 --> 00:56:28,914
with fucking pig farmers-
that's bullshit, man.

907
00:56:28,985 --> 00:56:31,078
You want to fight in real fights-
proper fights

908
00:56:31,154 --> 00:56:32,883
with proper prize money
and betting money.

909
00:56:32,956 --> 00:56:34,719
That's how you make money
in fighting.

910
00:56:34,791 --> 00:56:37,760
- So when do we get some?
- I've already put the word out.

911
00:56:37,827 --> 00:56:41,263
When Brandon wins his next one,
we can book an open fight.

912
00:56:41,331 --> 00:56:44,459
I'm telling you, that's when we're all
gonna get paid.

913
00:56:44,534 --> 00:56:47,025
Hell yeah. That's what
I'm talking about.

914
00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:49,128
- Cheers.
- All right.

915
00:57:19,135 --> 00:57:21,968
Are you crazy?
What the hell are you doing, man?

916
00:57:23,373 --> 00:57:25,967
Where's your punk friend
of my sister's?

917
00:57:26,042 --> 00:57:27,976
Huh?

918
00:57:28,044 --> 00:57:29,568
How would I know?

919
00:57:29,646 --> 00:57:34,106
Dude, I'm gonna ask you
one more time nicely.

920
00:57:34,184 --> 00:57:35,776
I told you-
I don't know.

921
00:57:35,852 --> 00:57:39,447
See, that's not asking
very nice, all right?

922
00:57:39,522 --> 00:57:41,285
- Are you stupid?
- Come on, guys,

923
00:57:41,357 --> 00:57:43,825
I don't have anything to do
with your beef with Brandon.

924
00:57:43,893 --> 00:57:46,088
Shut up.
Shut up!

925
00:57:46,162 --> 00:57:48,756
Tell your friend to stay the fuck away
from my sister.

926
00:57:48,832 --> 00:57:50,732
You understand?

927
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:52,995
- You understand?
- Yeah.

928
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:02,642
You make sure
he gets the message.

929
00:58:02,712 --> 00:58:04,009
You got that?

930
00:58:10,453 --> 00:58:13,422
Do you, like,
clean your tools ever?

931
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:15,822
Can you hand me
a socket wrench?

932
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:20,396
Is this it?
What is this?

933
00:58:20,463 --> 00:58:22,397
Does this look like
a socket wrench?

934
00:58:22,465 --> 00:58:24,399
I don't know what that is.

935
00:58:24,467 --> 00:58:27,334
Look here-
socket, wrench.

936
00:58:27,403 --> 00:58:28,631
It's a socket wrench.

937
00:58:28,705 --> 00:58:30,639
How about I just sock you
with this-

938
00:58:30,707 --> 00:58:32,641
this giant hammer?

939
00:58:32,709 --> 00:58:35,837
I thought you were sweet
when I met you.

940
00:58:35,912 --> 00:58:37,846
You want to make me
a sandwich instead?

941
00:58:37,914 --> 00:58:40,382
- A sandwich?
- Do you want to make me a sandwich?

942
00:58:40,450 --> 00:58:42,441
Yeah, I'm gonna give you
a sandwich, honey.

943
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:44,749
Oh, I will give you a sandwich,
you know I will.

944
00:59:01,304 --> 00:59:03,238
Hey.

945
00:59:03,306 --> 00:59:05,536
- Hey, what's up?
- How's it going?

946
00:59:05,608 --> 00:59:08,202
I can book you
another fight,

947
00:59:08,278 --> 00:59:09,609
but it's tomorrow.

948
00:59:09,679 --> 00:59:11,772
- Are you up for it?
- Yeah, man, set it up.

949
00:59:11,848 --> 00:59:13,611
Are you sure?
Are you sure you can fit it in

950
00:59:13,683 --> 00:59:15,480
between your little
palettes there?

951
00:59:15,552 --> 00:59:16,746
- Yeah, book it.
- Yeah, all right then.

952
00:59:16,819 --> 00:59:18,946
I'll pick you up
at noon.

953
00:59:19,022 --> 00:59:20,614
Get your ass
back to work.

954
00:59:28,765 --> 00:59:31,495
Hey, Garret, boss,
I need a word with you.

955
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:34,230
- What is it?
- I need some time off.

956
00:59:34,304 --> 00:59:36,169
- You're not sick, are you?
- No no, nothing like that.

957
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:38,139
Drake booked another fight.
It's tomorrow.

958
00:59:38,207 --> 00:59:39,504
Oh, good. Of course.
Of course.

959
00:59:39,576 --> 00:59:41,703
Take the week off-
protecting my investment.

960
00:59:41,778 --> 00:59:43,109
I appreciate that.

961
00:59:43,179 --> 00:59:45,170
Hey, tell Todd
I hope he's feeling better.

962
00:59:45,248 --> 00:59:47,648
- What do you mean?
- You haven't heard?

963
00:59:47,717 --> 00:59:50,811
That Victor kid
kicked the crap out of him.

964
00:59:50,887 --> 00:59:52,912
His mom said he worked
him over really good.

965
00:59:52,989 --> 00:59:54,286
When the fuck
was this?

966
00:59:54,357 --> 00:59:56,825
Yesterday, I guess.
I thought you knew.

967
00:59:56,893 --> 00:59:59,327
No.
Thank you.

968
01:00:09,839 --> 01:00:12,307
Todd honey,

969
01:00:12,375 --> 01:00:14,866
one of your friends
is here to see you.

970
01:00:16,679 --> 01:00:18,909
Hey man, what's up?

971
01:00:18,982 --> 01:00:23,214
Not much, bro.

972
01:00:23,286 --> 01:00:25,379
But I don't think Victor
likes you very much-

973
01:00:25,455 --> 01:00:27,047
just the sense
I'm getting.

974
01:00:27,123 --> 01:00:29,785
Man, don't sweat him.

975
01:00:29,859 --> 01:00:31,793
It was him and Jason.

976
01:00:31,861 --> 01:00:34,091
You shouldn't be thinking
about that stuff right now.

977
01:00:34,163 --> 01:00:36,131
Are you all right?
Do you need anything?

978
01:00:38,534 --> 01:00:42,026
Just don't tell anybody
I still live with my mom,

979
01:00:42,105 --> 01:00:44,573
okay, please?

980
01:00:44,641 --> 01:00:47,405
You got it, bro.

981
01:00:47,477 --> 01:00:49,411
So when's
your next fight?

982
01:00:49,479 --> 01:00:51,413
It's tomorrow.

983
01:00:51,481 --> 01:00:53,210
I'll be there.

984
01:00:53,282 --> 01:00:55,045
Are you gonna be all right
to come?

985
01:00:55,118 --> 01:00:57,814
Yeah, man, don't worry.
Just get ready.

986
01:00:57,887 --> 01:01:00,412
Kick some ass,
all right?

987
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:03,152
Appreciate it.
You get better, okay?

988
01:01:25,214 --> 01:01:26,943
Eh, my ribs, man.

989
01:01:27,016 --> 01:01:29,177
- Are you gonna be okay?
- I'll be all right.

990
01:01:33,956 --> 01:01:36,584
- Hey, Connor.
- Hey, Price.

991
01:01:36,659 --> 01:01:39,594
I hope this isn't
your fighter.

992
01:01:39,662 --> 01:01:42,324
No. This is Brandon.

993
01:01:44,267 --> 01:01:46,132
Kyle.

994
01:01:47,403 --> 01:01:49,496
- All right.
- Let's get going.

995
01:01:49,572 --> 01:01:51,699
These boys came all the way
down here from Dallas.

996
01:01:51,774 --> 01:01:53,901
Okay, 10 large.

997
01:01:53,976 --> 01:01:56,638
Right.
Let's get it on.

998
01:02:00,083 --> 01:02:01,641
Now I know nothing
about this guy.

999
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:03,948
Take him out quick.

1000
01:02:04,987 --> 01:02:06,352
Ready?

1001
01:02:08,991 --> 01:02:10,117
Fight!

1002
01:02:53,136 --> 01:02:54,831
That's it.
That's it.

1003
01:03:10,386 --> 01:03:13,253
Hey, you look good, man.
You look really good.

1004
01:03:13,322 --> 01:03:15,153
Interested in coming up to Dallas,
doing some fighting?

1005
01:03:15,224 --> 01:03:17,158
I can make you
some good money, man.

1006
01:03:17,226 --> 01:03:19,592
Hey hey, he's already got
a partner, Price.

1007
01:03:19,662 --> 01:03:21,562
I hear ya.

1008
01:03:21,631 --> 01:03:23,360
No harm in asking.

1009
01:03:23,432 --> 01:03:26,230
- All right.
- Nice fight.

1010
01:03:26,302 --> 01:03:28,202
Thank you very much.

1011
01:03:28,271 --> 01:03:30,034
I'll be talking to ya.

1012
01:03:30,106 --> 01:03:31,573
See you, Price.

1013
01:03:39,315 --> 01:03:42,580
Oh, it's so nice
not having to go to work.

1014
01:03:42,652 --> 01:03:44,677
I could do this
every day.

1015
01:03:44,754 --> 01:03:47,552
You'd get bored.

1016
01:03:49,125 --> 01:03:50,683
No, I wouldn't.

1017
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:53,194
You would, honestly.

1018
01:03:53,262 --> 01:03:55,196
I do this
nearly every day.

1019
01:03:55,264 --> 01:03:57,255
You'd get bored.

1020
01:03:57,333 --> 01:03:59,767
A man needs a reason
to get up in the morning.

1021
01:03:59,836 --> 01:04:02,896
So is that why
you stopped fighting

1022
01:04:02,972 --> 01:04:04,906
and moved out
to this bumfuck town?

1023
01:04:04,974 --> 01:04:07,670
I didn't stop fighting.
And I certainly didn't move here.

1024
01:04:07,743 --> 01:04:10,303
I had no choice.

1025
01:04:10,379 --> 01:04:12,574
What do you mean?

1026
01:04:14,917 --> 01:04:19,115
Well, believe it or not,

1027
01:04:19,188 --> 01:04:21,986
I'm in the witness
protection program.

1028
01:04:25,695 --> 01:04:27,128
Are you serious?

1029
01:04:27,196 --> 01:04:29,357
Seriously. Seriously.

1030
01:04:29,432 --> 01:04:32,560
I'm glad you think it's funny.

1031
01:04:32,635 --> 01:04:34,569
Well, the story goes,

1032
01:04:34,637 --> 01:04:37,299
I was being backed by some
wise guys out of Jersey,

1033
01:04:37,373 --> 01:04:39,898
doing well, making money.

1034
01:04:39,976 --> 01:04:41,910
Then one day they came to me,

1035
01:04:41,978 --> 01:04:44,811
they said, "We want you
to throw a fight. "

1036
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:47,076
I said no.
One thing led to another.

1037
01:04:47,149 --> 01:04:50,744
It ended up with me
smashing the guy's head in.

1038
01:04:50,820 --> 01:04:52,981
When the guy died,

1039
01:04:53,055 --> 01:04:56,582
the Feds came to me,
offered me a deal.

1040
01:04:56,659 --> 01:04:58,593
They said if I testified,

1041
01:04:58,661 --> 01:05:00,788
they'd set me up with
a new life somewhere.

1042
01:05:04,467 --> 01:05:07,561
Yeah, this is somewhere all right.

1043
01:05:08,838 --> 01:05:12,035
Anyway, I fight once in a while.

1044
01:05:12,108 --> 01:05:14,303
It stops me
going out of my mind

1045
01:05:14,377 --> 01:05:16,242
and gives me
a bit of spare cash.

1046
01:05:16,312 --> 01:05:18,576
So what, the Feds
don't give you any money?

1047
01:05:18,648 --> 01:05:20,582
Shit.
Fucking hell, man.

1048
01:05:20,650 --> 01:05:23,949
No, the fucking
assholes-

1049
01:05:24,020 --> 01:05:26,386
they literally give me
just enough to survive.

1050
01:05:26,455 --> 01:05:28,616
That's why
I took your deal.

1051
01:05:32,495 --> 01:05:34,429
One minute, sweetheart.

1052
01:05:34,497 --> 01:05:36,124
I'll be right back.

1053
01:05:45,908 --> 01:05:49,309
Well...

1054
01:05:49,378 --> 01:05:51,369
it's good.

1055
01:05:51,447 --> 01:05:52,937
We are on.

1056
01:05:53,015 --> 01:05:54,983
And the money?

1057
01:05:55,051 --> 01:05:56,643
Open book.
Who knows?

1058
01:05:56,719 --> 01:05:59,745
Could go
as high as $50,000.

1059
01:05:59,822 --> 01:06:03,189
But there is one thing.

1060
01:06:03,259 --> 01:06:04,783
Yeah, what's that?

1061
01:06:04,860 --> 01:06:08,159
You're fighting Victor.

1062
01:06:19,875 --> 01:06:21,809
Do you really
have to do this?

1063
01:06:21,877 --> 01:06:23,868
Yeah.

1064
01:06:25,281 --> 01:06:27,442
I don't want
any part of it.

1065
01:06:29,251 --> 01:06:32,345
Forget about that shit.
Focus on the job at hand.

1066
01:06:32,421 --> 01:06:34,514
Come on.

1067
01:06:38,227 --> 01:06:39,819
Cool, man?

1068
01:06:39,895 --> 01:06:41,726
Of course he's cool.

1069
01:06:41,797 --> 01:06:44,322
I don't know how you're not nervous.
I'm freaking out.

1070
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:46,493
Will you
shut the fuck up?

1071
01:06:46,569 --> 01:06:48,799
You shouldn't even
be here.

1072
01:06:59,849 --> 01:07:02,409
Hey, man, I'm Kent.
I spoke with you on the phone.

1073
01:07:02,485 --> 01:07:03,918
- How's it going?
- Good good.

1074
01:07:03,986 --> 01:07:06,113
- This is pretty exciting, huh?
- Yeah.

1075
01:07:06,188 --> 01:07:08,622
Every high roller
in the county must be here.

1076
01:07:08,691 --> 01:07:10,818
- It is quite the event.
- Your boy ready?

1077
01:07:10,893 --> 01:07:12,986
He's always ready.

1078
01:07:13,062 --> 01:07:15,326
Good good.
You know, I was thinking-

1079
01:07:15,398 --> 01:07:18,834
Cut the shit, Kent.
Let's get this thing started.

1080
01:07:20,202 --> 01:07:22,170
All right.

1081
01:07:24,540 --> 01:07:26,167
Let's do it.

1082
01:07:26,242 --> 01:07:27,903
We need to get the bets in.

1083
01:07:27,977 --> 01:07:31,208
Bullshit. I'll cover anybody
lays off on Victor.

1084
01:07:39,121 --> 01:07:40,918
All right, boys,
let's have a good show.

1085
01:07:40,990 --> 01:07:42,753
Fight.

1086
01:07:42,825 --> 01:07:44,759
# Feel better
about yourself #

1087
01:07:44,827 --> 01:07:46,761
# I didn't care
to know your name #

1088
01:07:46,829 --> 01:07:49,696
# But you made it a point
to try to dump mine #

1089
01:07:49,765 --> 01:07:53,826
# And then the words slip #

1090
01:07:53,903 --> 01:07:55,837
# Try my best
to find a way #

1091
01:07:55,905 --> 01:07:58,635
# To will this bullshit
past aside... #

1092
01:07:58,707 --> 01:08:01,301
Boy, you got nothing!

1093
01:08:01,377 --> 01:08:03,311
# So hey #

1094
01:08:03,379 --> 01:08:05,370
# Don't you run away
from me #

1095
01:08:05,448 --> 01:08:07,746
# So I can see
your face #

1096
01:08:07,817 --> 01:08:12,413
# So I can lay a fortune
on the floor #

1097
01:08:12,488 --> 01:08:14,752
# Seems like you've found
your place #

1098
01:08:14,824 --> 01:08:17,019
# On a torture raid #

1099
01:08:17,093 --> 01:08:20,654
# Now you're laying a fortune
on the floor #

1100
01:08:20,729 --> 01:08:23,197
# You're bleeding #

1101
01:08:23,265 --> 01:08:25,756
# Yeah yeah yeah yeah #

1102
01:08:25,835 --> 01:08:28,360
# I didn't think
to realize #

1103
01:08:28,437 --> 01:08:32,533
# But I know if I'm wrong,
ways to figure out #

1104
01:08:32,608 --> 01:08:35,236
# What could have been
and what's just wrong #

1105
01:08:35,311 --> 01:08:37,245
# And I hate to be
the one #

1106
01:08:37,313 --> 01:08:39,781
# To fucking throw it
in your face #

1107
01:08:39,849 --> 01:08:41,817
# To put you
in your place #

1108
01:08:41,884 --> 01:08:43,818
# To show you
the other way #

1109
01:08:43,886 --> 01:08:45,820
# Try my best
to find a way #

1110
01:08:45,888 --> 01:08:49,722
# To will this
bullshit past aside #

1111
01:08:49,792 --> 01:08:51,817
# Run through #

1112
01:08:51,894 --> 01:08:55,694
# So hey, don't you run away
from me. #

1113
01:08:55,764 --> 01:08:57,698
Oh!

1114
01:08:57,766 --> 01:08:59,734
Did you see that?

1115
01:09:03,372 --> 01:09:05,237
- Told ya.
- You got him, B.

1116
01:09:05,307 --> 01:09:07,002
What's the matter? Get up!

1117
01:09:07,076 --> 01:09:10,534
You got him.
Man, good job.

1118
01:09:10,613 --> 01:09:12,547
That's the way, man.

1119
01:09:12,615 --> 01:09:14,378
Well done.

1120
01:09:39,475 --> 01:09:42,000
Can I come in?

1121
01:09:45,447 --> 01:09:47,438
Please.

1122
01:09:49,852 --> 01:09:52,286
So you're
a tough guy, huh?

1123
01:09:56,091 --> 01:09:58,559
Can I come in?

1124
01:10:09,104 --> 01:10:11,095
Are you okay?

1125
01:10:12,975 --> 01:10:15,876
I'm sorry.

1126
01:10:15,945 --> 01:10:18,436
I wouldn't hurt you.

1127
01:10:28,824 --> 01:10:30,815
I'm sorry.

1128
01:10:51,814 --> 01:10:53,748
Are you expecting
somebody?

1129
01:10:53,816 --> 01:10:55,807
No.

1130
01:11:05,261 --> 01:11:08,458
Can I talk to my sister
for a minute?

1131
01:11:10,132 --> 01:11:12,123
It's okay.

1132
01:11:42,865 --> 01:11:45,459
I had this whole
speech planned.

1133
01:11:51,273 --> 01:11:53,207
You know,

1134
01:11:53,275 --> 01:11:57,712
when Mom passed away,

1135
01:11:57,780 --> 01:12:01,272
you were all I had, so-

1136
01:12:01,350 --> 01:12:02,942
- Victor, I don't-
- No, wait wait.

1137
01:12:03,018 --> 01:12:04,781
Just-

1138
01:12:04,853 --> 01:12:08,016
what I'm trying
to say is

1139
01:12:08,090 --> 01:12:12,049
that I-

1140
01:12:12,127 --> 01:12:15,688
I know that I haven't been
the best brother,

1141
01:12:15,764 --> 01:12:18,995
but it wasn't
for lack of trying.

1142
01:12:19,068 --> 01:12:22,469
You know, Dad split...

1143
01:12:25,541 --> 01:12:29,102
and Mom passed away.

1144
01:12:29,178 --> 01:12:33,410
And we got stuck
with Rod.

1145
01:12:33,482 --> 01:12:35,473
And...

1146
01:12:38,187 --> 01:12:40,451
you were
my responsibility,

1147
01:12:40,522 --> 01:12:42,285
you know?

1148
01:12:42,358 --> 01:12:45,850
I'm not your
responsibility anymore.

1149
01:12:47,996 --> 01:12:50,487
I know that.

1150
01:12:53,102 --> 01:12:55,127
That's what
I came here to say.

1151
01:12:57,673 --> 01:13:01,404
I know you're not
a little girl anymore.

1152
01:13:01,477 --> 01:13:05,413
And...

1153
01:13:05,481 --> 01:13:08,450
you- you grew up

1154
01:13:08,517 --> 01:13:11,509
to be this really
beautiful woman.

1155
01:13:16,024 --> 01:13:18,686
And you deserve better.

1156
01:13:24,199 --> 01:13:26,133
And I'm gonna have to
learn to let you go.

1157
01:13:26,201 --> 01:13:28,135
And it's not
gonna be easy,

1158
01:13:28,203 --> 01:13:31,172
but I'm gonna try.

1159
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:33,640
I'm gonna try, okay?

1160
01:13:50,726 --> 01:13:54,890
Thank you.
Thank you.

1161
01:14:06,975 --> 01:14:08,909
He's not such a bad guy.

1162
01:14:08,977 --> 01:14:11,571
I know.

1163
01:14:15,350 --> 01:14:17,250
He's not.

1164
01:14:18,420 --> 01:14:20,411
I'm gonna go.

1165
01:14:39,508 --> 01:14:43,239
Are you okay?

1166
01:14:43,312 --> 01:14:45,473
Yeah, it was
my mom's ring.

1167
01:14:45,547 --> 01:14:48,277
I didn't know
he had it.

1168
01:14:53,689 --> 01:14:56,351
I'm gonna be leaving.

1169
01:15:00,462 --> 01:15:02,396
I want you to come
with me.

1170
01:15:02,464 --> 01:15:04,932
Of course.

1171
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,594
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1172
01:15:26,555 --> 01:15:28,648
"Dear Dad,

1173
01:15:28,724 --> 01:15:31,090
you always told Frankie and me
that a man is measured

1174
01:15:31,159 --> 01:15:33,491
by the strength
of his enemies.

1175
01:15:33,562 --> 01:15:35,496
But you're wrong.

1176
01:15:35,564 --> 01:15:39,000
A man is measured by the strength
of the love others have for him.

1177
01:15:39,067 --> 01:15:41,934
I hope one day you and I
can put away the pain

1178
01:15:42,004 --> 01:15:45,565
and actually talk
to each other.

1179
01:15:45,641 --> 01:15:47,575
Love,

1180
01:15:47,643 --> 01:15:49,634
your son Brandon. "

1181
01:16:08,897 --> 01:16:11,161
You're not gonna fucking
believe this shit.

1182
01:16:13,602 --> 01:16:17,129
Oh, the prodigal son
returns.

1183
01:16:17,205 --> 01:16:19,935
You got a lot of balls
coming in here, kid.

1184
01:16:20,008 --> 01:16:22,533
But then again, I take it
you got me something.

1185
01:16:22,611 --> 01:16:24,442
Not exactly.

1186
01:16:29,251 --> 01:16:31,583
Exactly what then?

1187
01:16:31,653 --> 01:16:33,848
A business proposal.

1188
01:16:33,922 --> 01:16:38,086
Unless this conversation

1189
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:42,221
starts and ends with me
getting my fucking money,

1190
01:16:42,297 --> 01:16:43,764
you ain't walking
out of here.

1191
01:16:43,832 --> 01:16:46,426
Just hear me out.

1192
01:16:50,005 --> 01:16:51,165
Sit.

1193
01:16:59,081 --> 01:17:01,276
What if I told you
I can get your money back,

1194
01:17:01,350 --> 01:17:02,612
plus a whole lot more?

1195
01:17:02,684 --> 01:17:04,117
I'm listening.

1196
01:17:04,186 --> 01:17:06,848
Okay, here's the deal...

1197
01:17:16,465 --> 01:17:19,434
Give me a call when you're ready
to make some money.

1198
01:17:27,843 --> 01:17:30,869
You don't really think this fucking
mug's gonna lie down, do you?

1199
01:17:30,946 --> 01:17:32,880
Why not?

1200
01:17:32,948 --> 01:17:35,416
He's as greedy
as his brother Frankie was.

1201
01:17:35,484 --> 01:17:39,648
But just in case,
follow him.

1202
01:17:39,721 --> 01:17:41,154
And another thing-

1203
01:17:41,223 --> 01:17:44,420
call around, see if
anybody heard anything.

1204
01:17:44,493 --> 01:17:46,586
If not,
book the fight.

1205
01:17:52,100 --> 01:17:54,034
When this is over,

1206
01:17:54,102 --> 01:17:55,899
I want to go as far away
as possible.

1207
01:17:55,971 --> 01:17:58,235
Yeah? Where would
you want to go?

1208
01:17:58,306 --> 01:18:01,764
Anywhere,
as long as it's sunny

1209
01:18:01,843 --> 01:18:04,676
and there's water

1210
01:18:04,746 --> 01:18:07,408
and there's
really nice beaches.

1211
01:18:07,482 --> 01:18:10,212
We can always take a ride
up the West Coast.

1212
01:18:10,285 --> 01:18:11,513
Yeah?

1213
01:18:11,586 --> 01:18:14,680
That would be
amazing.

1214
01:18:19,928 --> 01:18:21,919
Hey.

1215
01:18:24,466 --> 01:18:26,457
All right, good.

1216
01:18:30,572 --> 01:18:32,563
The day after tomorrow.

1217
01:18:51,093 --> 01:18:53,027
All right, kid,

1218
01:18:53,095 --> 01:18:55,029
you know what
you gotta do out there.

1219
01:18:55,097 --> 01:18:59,261
And just so you don't
do anything stupid,

1220
01:18:59,334 --> 01:19:02,132
we've decided to get
a little bit of insurance.

1221
01:19:10,912 --> 01:19:12,903
Don't fuck it up.

1222
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:40,974
All bets are closed.
All are closed.

1223
01:19:41,042 --> 01:19:43,203
All right,
are you ready?

1224
01:19:43,278 --> 01:19:45,769
Are you ready?
On my mark.

1225
01:19:45,847 --> 01:19:47,280
Fight!

1226
01:20:04,900 --> 01:20:09,337
# Hearing your words
out of my mouth again #

1227
01:20:09,404 --> 01:20:13,602
# Leaves me stuck
with the key to #

1228
01:20:13,675 --> 01:20:17,509
# All these reasons
you got in my head again #

1229
01:20:17,579 --> 01:20:21,208
# Buried here
inside of me #

1230
01:20:21,283 --> 01:20:23,877
# Return #

1231
01:20:23,952 --> 01:20:27,945
# All of this to sender #

1232
01:20:28,023 --> 01:20:32,187
# The mirror spoke to me
and showed #

1233
01:20:32,260 --> 01:20:36,060
# All of this pretending #

1234
01:20:36,131 --> 01:20:38,622
# Is catching up to me #

1235
01:20:38,700 --> 01:20:40,565
# Lights out, wake up- #

1236
01:20:58,486 --> 01:21:01,080
# -Or be an eyesore #

1237
01:21:01,156 --> 01:21:05,058
# Lights out, wake up,
stay calm, decide #

1238
01:21:05,126 --> 01:21:09,324
# Reach up, stand
or be an eyesore. #

1239
01:21:40,161 --> 01:21:43,028
Sweetheart,

1240
01:21:43,098 --> 01:21:45,464
you know how to pick 'em,
don't you?

1241
01:21:48,336 --> 01:21:51,533
That kid just chose

1242
01:21:51,606 --> 01:21:54,507
his ego

1243
01:21:54,576 --> 01:21:57,010
over your life.

1244
01:21:58,346 --> 01:22:00,712
Can you believe that?

1245
01:22:01,816 --> 01:22:05,650
I just can't
figure out why...

1246
01:22:05,720 --> 01:22:07,551
this fuck hole would choose

1247
01:22:07,622 --> 01:22:11,080
to get his goddamn neck slit
to keep a fucking win streak!

1248
01:22:11,159 --> 01:22:13,127
Can you tell me?
Can you tell me?

1249
01:22:13,194 --> 01:22:16,755
Can you fucking tell me?
Can anybody fucking tell me?

1250
01:22:35,483 --> 01:22:38,008
Give it to Jimmy.

1251
01:22:38,086 --> 01:22:40,213
Pay 'em their
fucking winnings.

1252
01:22:52,634 --> 01:22:57,003
I had this little
black dog

1253
01:22:57,072 --> 01:23:01,168
when I was a kid.

1254
01:23:01,242 --> 01:23:04,109
We tried like hell

1255
01:23:04,179 --> 01:23:08,206
to train that mutt,
but it was so stupid.

1256
01:23:08,283 --> 01:23:11,150
Maybe it was retarded.

1257
01:23:11,219 --> 01:23:13,187
They got retarded dogs?

1258
01:23:16,191 --> 01:23:18,216
I don't know.

1259
01:23:22,497 --> 01:23:24,431
I tried

1260
01:23:24,499 --> 01:23:27,024
to teach this little
nigger dog

1261
01:23:27,102 --> 01:23:28,626
for hours,

1262
01:23:28,703 --> 01:23:31,797
but he just
didn't get it.

1263
01:23:31,873 --> 01:23:35,775
Finally,

1264
01:23:35,844 --> 01:23:39,041
you know what that
little fucker did?

1265
01:23:39,114 --> 01:23:41,480
He bit me.

1266
01:23:43,151 --> 01:23:46,712
You know what happened
to that little dog?

1267
01:23:46,788 --> 01:23:50,417
My father

1268
01:23:50,492 --> 01:23:54,053
shot it

1269
01:23:54,129 --> 01:23:57,064
right in
the fucking head.

1270
01:24:02,637 --> 01:24:05,902
But you know what I remember
also about that day?

1271
01:24:09,110 --> 01:24:11,340
My father

1272
01:24:11,413 --> 01:24:15,474
was still not
satisfied.

1273
01:24:15,550 --> 01:24:19,816
So I'm not going to
kill you.

1274
01:24:19,888 --> 01:24:21,822
I don't think
I'm going to get

1275
01:24:21,890 --> 01:24:25,553
the emotional closure
I need out of that.

1276
01:24:25,627 --> 01:24:28,289
Instead I'm going to fuck

1277
01:24:28,363 --> 01:24:31,958
pointy tits over here

1278
01:24:32,033 --> 01:24:34,831
right in the mouth

1279
01:24:34,903 --> 01:24:37,838
while you watch.

1280
01:24:37,906 --> 01:24:39,840
And then I'm going
to have Carlo

1281
01:24:39,908 --> 01:24:41,933
shoot you
in the fucking head.

1282
01:24:42,010 --> 01:24:46,276
And then maybe,
just maybe,

1283
01:24:46,347 --> 01:24:49,805
I might get
some satisfaction

1284
01:24:49,884 --> 01:24:54,082
knowing that you'll go
to the great beyond

1285
01:24:54,155 --> 01:24:57,488
wondering if
I'm gonna keep her

1286
01:24:57,559 --> 01:24:59,686
or kill her.

1287
01:25:02,130 --> 01:25:06,226
That depends on
how good she is.

1288
01:25:11,439 --> 01:25:13,464
Fucking step over here now!

1289
01:25:35,196 --> 01:25:36,925
Nice doing business
with you boys.

1290
01:25:36,998 --> 01:25:38,625
Thank you very much.

1291
01:25:38,700 --> 01:25:40,793
- Take care of yourself, kid.
- You too.

1292
01:25:40,869 --> 01:25:42,234
Love to do it again
sometime.

1293
01:25:42,303 --> 01:25:44,703
See you around.

1294
01:25:49,511 --> 01:25:53,003
Cutting it a little close
back there, don't you think?

1295
01:25:53,081 --> 01:25:55,208
That's because dipshit got us lost
on the way over.

1296
01:25:55,283 --> 01:25:57,183
Hey, come on.

1297
01:25:57,252 --> 01:26:00,050
All right, man, don't hang
around here too long.

1298
01:26:00,121 --> 01:26:01,713
Take it easy.

1299
01:26:01,789 --> 01:26:03,347
You take care.

1300
01:26:05,126 --> 01:26:08,357
Hey, if you're ever
in town-

1301
01:26:08,429 --> 01:26:10,363
You got it.

1302
01:26:12,567 --> 01:26:14,000
Can I drive?

1303
01:26:14,068 --> 01:26:15,592
You're lucky
you're not walking.

1304
01:26:37,058 --> 01:26:39,390
That's a lot of money
you got there.

1305
01:26:39,460 --> 01:26:42,122
Yeah.

1306
01:26:42,197 --> 01:26:44,631
Are you really gonna
do this?

1307
01:26:44,699 --> 01:26:46,633
Yeah,

1308
01:26:46,701 --> 01:26:49,602
I think so.

1309
01:26:49,671 --> 01:26:52,003
Are you scared?

1310
01:26:56,377 --> 01:26:58,470
Not as long as
I have you.

1311
01:27:39,854 --> 01:27:42,687
# This is our time #

1312
01:27:42,757 --> 01:27:45,590
# This is our moment #

1313
01:27:45,660 --> 01:27:48,493
# After everything #

1314
01:27:48,563 --> 01:27:51,396
# That we have been through #

1315
01:27:51,466 --> 01:27:53,900
# This is my chance #

1316
01:27:53,968 --> 01:27:57,131
# To pull you in closer #

1317
01:27:57,205 --> 01:28:00,402
# We'll have it all #

1318
01:28:00,475 --> 01:28:02,409
# Yeah #

1319
01:28:02,477 --> 01:28:07,540
# Yeah, this is our time #

1320
01:28:34,642 --> 01:28:36,940
# This is our time #

1321
01:28:37,011 --> 01:28:39,775
# This is our moment #

1322
01:28:39,847 --> 01:28:42,645
# After everything #

1323
01:28:42,717 --> 01:28:45,709
# That we have been through #

1324
01:28:45,787 --> 01:28:48,153
# This is my chance #

1325
01:28:48,222 --> 01:28:50,884
# To pull you in closer #

1326
01:28:50,958 --> 01:28:54,826
# We'll have it all #

1327
01:28:54,896 --> 01:28:56,659
# Yeah #

1328
01:28:56,731 --> 01:29:01,691
# Yeah, this is our time. #
