7
00:06:16,832 --> 00:06:19,358
It was found nacked

12
00:06:33,951 --> 00:06:37,022
The ship will sail in the morning.
It is now or never.

13
00:06:37,052 --> 00:06:39,741
Where do you think
we gonna find a "mule"...

14
00:06:39,773 --> 00:06:42,876
that he speaks "Yurumbi", or what
language it is, they will rape us of?

15
00:06:42,911 --> 00:06:45,296
Don't worry.

00:06:51,165 --> 00:06:52,145

We need to talk.

20
00:07:20,088 --> 00:07:23,031
The worst happened.
Baaba is dead.

21
00:07:23,065 --> 00:07:26,073
- Paul, listen...
- Didn't you hear me? I Said Baaba died.

22
00:07:26,108 --> 00:07:28,724
- Who is Baaba?
- "Who is Baaba?"

23
00:07:32,532 --> 00:07:33,516

00:07:35,865 --> 00:07:37,080

25
00:07:37,114 --> 00:07:40,460
What happend with you?
Why are you acting like this?

26
00:07:41,268 --> 00:07:42,417
You dont remember?

27
00:07:43,062 --> 00:07:44,757
He would negotiate
with the Africans...

28
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:46,134
and steal the money.

29
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:49,075
To steal from who?

30
00:07:50,614 --> 00:07:51,821
Of my father.

31
00:07:52,979 --> 00:07:54,442
You gonna steal your fathers money?

32
00:07:56,531 --> 00:07:59,849
Everything was drifted.
We will split the money.

33
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:04,394
But he is your father.

34
00:08:05,202 --> 00:08:07,309
How do you think we will leave from here?

35
00:08:07,572 --> 00:08:10,319
With our beauty?
Our charm?

36
00:08:13,523 --> 00:08:16,912
I will find a way. Go home
and wait for me to call you.

37
00:08:16,947 --> 00:08:17,896
Paul...

38
00:08:19,058 --> 00:08:20,620
I need to speak with you.

39
00:08:26,062 --> 00:08:30,090
Don't worry, Angie.
We will leave tomorrow.

40
00:08:39,054 --> 00:08:40,265
Nothing changed.

58
00:11:15,099 --> 00:11:16,348

59
00:11:17,693 --> 00:11:18,908
It depends...

00:11:19,869 --> 00:11:21,530
How much money 

61
00:11:21,982 --> 00:11:25,591
So much that never again you will
need to wash plates as long as you live.

62
00:15:26,309 --> 00:15:29,378
Don't give the suitcase before receiving
the money. Did you understand?

63
00:15:29,412 --> 00:15:30,723
Yes, I understood.

64
00:15:33,635 --> 00:15:37,181

00:15:50,788 --> 00:15:51,801
Wemba...

69
00:15:53,758 --> 00:15:55,766
I dislike to do that...

70
00:15:56,291 --> 00:15:58,461
but I will need
of a guarrantee.

71
00:16:00,322 --> 00:16:02,587

- Your passport.

72
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:06,460
My passport.

73
00:16:21,019 --> 00:16:26,583
it is better to have it with me..

74
00:16:30,874 --> 00:16:33,019
I work for you

75
00:16:33,052 --> 00:16:35,516

77
00:16:38,141 --> 00:16:40,114
I don't do such thing...

78
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:48,596
I see you later.

79
00:17:11,702 --> 00:17:14,200
- What was?
- I don't believe that you trust him.

80
00:17:14,232 --> 00:17:16,402
I don't have choice.

81
00:17:17,687 --> 00:17:19,029
Drive.

82
00:17:33,237 --> 00:17:35,095
Wemba is a good man.
I trust him.

83
00:17:35,128 --> 00:17:36,787
How does you know that is reliable?

84
00:17:37,461 --> 00:17:40,940
They only negotiate with Africans
that you they speak loruba.

85
00:17:41,269 --> 00:17:42,701
Do you speak loruba?

86
00:17:43,412 --> 00:17:45,171
Just, stop complaining.

87
00:17:46,067 --> 00:17:48,242
Who guarantees that he wont
flee with the money?

88
00:17:48,277 --> 00:17:50,066
There you come again.

89
00:17:51,508 --> 00:17:53,397
God damned!

90
00:17:53,429 --> 00:17:56,465
He is on his way.
you cant bring him back.

91
00:17:56,501 --> 00:18:00,657
He will give the cocaine,
be back in a few hours...

92
00:18:00,692 --> 00:18:03,218
- and we will be rich.
- You will be rich.

93
00:18:03,251 --> 00:18:05,675
I will have luck
in paying off my debts.

94
00:18:06,164 --> 00:18:09,235
I never rised you to be come
a degenerate player.

95
00:18:09,267 --> 00:18:12,562
No, you created me
to be a pimp.

96
00:18:12,595 --> 00:18:14,257
- Stop the car.
- what?

97
00:18:14,292 --> 00:18:16,808
Stop the car. Pull over now.

I need to arrange packing.

99
00:18:22,479 --> 00:18:24,392
You need to go to the nightclub.

100
00:18:25,167 --> 00:18:27,556
I have a plenty time.
It is still early.

101
00:18:29,331 --> 00:18:30,735
Listen here...

102
00:18:30,769 --> 00:18:32,873
the nightclub is yours now.

103
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,974
Sell and skirt of Brazil. I only want
to go back to the United States.

104
00:18:37,007 --> 00:18:40,431
Sell that dirtbag. Return to
New York and start from zero.

105
00:18:40,466 --> 00:18:42,990
I am only tellingyou that this 
is your last chance.

106
00:18:43,025 --> 00:18:44,931
Dont destroy everything.

I will call you in the same moment.

110
00:19:11,914 --> 00:19:13,452
Is everything well?

111
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:16,103
Everything is perfect.

112
00:19:16,844 --> 00:19:20,106
I returned in businesses
with the dish washer.

113
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:23,552
Baaba did me a favor
by dropping dead.

114
00:19:24,077 --> 00:19:26,924
- what?
- I will split the money.

115
00:19:26,956 --> 00:19:29,642
I didn't make that agreement
with the dish washer.

116
00:19:29,675 --> 00:19:32,294
you made a business
with the dish washer?

117
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:35,428
Yes, we will get rid of him
when he returns with the money.

118
00:19:36,137 --> 00:19:38,789
Before he give them
to your father?

119
00:20:04,805 --> 00:20:05,787
Honey?

120
00:20:10,501 --> 00:20:11,548
Hi, babby.

121
00:20:13,285 --> 00:20:14,267
Hi.

122
00:20:15,716 --> 00:20:17,822
I can see you finished with the packing.

123
00:20:19,203 --> 00:20:22,462
Yes, the housemaid 
took care of almost everything.

124
00:20:24,836 --> 00:20:25,919
Are you well?

125
00:20:29,441 --> 00:20:33,665
I am great.
I am only having a headache.

126
00:20:34,368 --> 00:20:36,930
- Do you want an aspirin?
- No.

127
00:20:36,965 --> 00:20:38,210
I already took one.

128
00:20:39,686 --> 00:20:41,209
I will prepare the boy.

129
00:20:42,018 --> 00:20:43,327
How were the things?

130
00:20:44,735 --> 00:20:45,954
They were well.

131
00:20:45,986 --> 00:20:48,854
There was a small problem.

132
00:20:49,827 --> 00:20:52,030
But I already took care of everything.

133
00:20:56,068 --> 00:21:00,093
Our man should arrive there
at any minute.

134
00:21:24,575 --> 00:21:26,778
- Do you have the tickets?
- Yes.

135
00:21:26,816 --> 00:21:28,701
Everything is in this envelope.

136
00:21:28,736 --> 00:21:30,904
- Which is my new name?
- I don't remember.

137
00:21:31,578 --> 00:21:32,923
You don't remember me ?

138
00:21:57,145 --> 00:21:58,456

139
00:21:58,492 --> 00:22:01,916

141
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:07,148
- Tell me.
- We are moving away.

142
00:22:08,024 --> 00:22:11,950
- Right. Where are we moving?
- I forgot.

143
00:22:14,072 --> 00:22:17,078
We are going to a place...

144
00:22:17,113 --> 00:22:20,790
hot, sunny
and entertaining.

145
00:22:21,558 --> 00:22:23,152
Give a hug to your father.

146
00:22:29,239 --> 00:22:31,441
I love you
more than everything in life.

147
00:22:31,895 --> 00:22:32,941
Dad?

148
00:22:33,558 --> 00:22:35,384
Do the monkeys fly?

149
00:22:35,416 --> 00:22:38,063
- what?
- Do the monkeys fly?

150
00:22:38,582 --> 00:22:39,954
Mom said not.

151
00:22:43,125 --> 00:22:48,852
- Well, that is not true.
- But they don't have wings.

152
00:22:48,886 --> 00:22:51,405
They don't have wings...

153
00:22:53,173 --> 00:22:57,748
but your mother is not
specialist in primates...

154
00:22:57,781 --> 00:22:59,274
as your father is.

155
00:23:00,596 --> 00:23:02,322
you knows, Lazar...

156
00:23:02,354 --> 00:23:06,097
There was a rare race of monkeys
that actually can fly.

157
00:23:07,795 --> 00:23:11,023
Be looking. He will fly
direct to the moon.

158
00:23:15,762 --> 00:23:17,354
I lost my monkey.

159
00:23:18,641 --> 00:23:21,456
- I am sorry.
- We will find the monkey tomorrow, ok?

160
00:23:22,736 --> 00:23:23,716
I 'll get that.

161
00:23:31,728 --> 00:23:34,347
Angie, sorry
for that I did before.

162
00:23:36,273 --> 00:23:38,890
I was overreacted.

163
00:23:39,183 --> 00:23:40,589
- Everything is well now.
- Listen...

164
00:23:40,623 --> 00:23:44,111
I am with the passports
and the tickets.

165
00:23:44,143 --> 00:23:45,767
I cant make that.

166
00:23:47,725 --> 00:23:50,190

What did change your mind?

167
00:23:50,223 --> 00:23:51,530
I cant.

168
00:23:52,334 --> 00:23:53,347
I won't make that.

169
00:23:54,383 --> 00:23:55,429

170
00:23:59,212 --> 00:24:01,100
No, Is your son.

171
00:24:05,803 --> 00:24:07,016
What do you want?

172
00:24:12,812 --> 00:24:14,240
Do you have any news from Wemba?

173
00:24:15,114 --> 00:24:17,517
Not yet.
He will call soon.

174
00:24:17,548 --> 00:24:21,353
- How can you be sure?
- Christ! There you come again.

175
00:24:21,388 --> 00:24:23,342
I need the money
as much as you.

176
00:24:23,372 --> 00:24:26,953
- Nobody said the opposite.
- He should not have gone alone.

177
00:24:26,989 --> 00:24:30,403
Enough ! I will call you
when I have news.

178
00:24:46,375 --> 00:24:47,688
Calm!

179
00:24:47,722 --> 00:24:49,510
Be calm!
Nothing did happen!

180

Don't drive to fast, dont brake any traffic 
signal, put the safe belt in the car...

197
00:32:50,103 --> 00:32:51,411
Just take your time.

198
00:32:51,698 --> 00:32:53,426
We will be waiting for you at the nightclub.

199
00:32:55,187 --> 00:32:56,203
Wemba?

200
00:32:58,803 --> 00:32:59,818

205
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:57,703

206
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:02,828
And what will happend

207
00:34:04,906 --> 00:34:06,468

208
00:34:18,317 --> 00:34:20,457

00:34:20,491 --> 00:34:22,724

00:34:37,738 --> 00:34:39,176

225
00:35:34,851 --> 00:35:35,930
Now what?

226
00:35:39,201 --> 00:35:40,959
Get in the car and follow him.

227
00:35:42,372 --> 00:35:43,354
And me?

228
00:35:44,194 --> 00:35:45,689
Catch the motorcycle...

229
00:35:47,109 --> 00:35:49,244

230
00:36:29,372 --> 00:36:31,380
- Detective.
- Hi, man.

231
00:36:31,869 --> 00:36:33,779
- sit down.
- Thank you.

232
00:36:35,454 --> 00:36:36,501
So...

233
00:36:38,139 --> 00:36:41,849
Why You came to visit us here?

234
00:36:42,584 --> 00:36:45,979
- What happened to your head?
- That...

235
00:36:46,014 --> 00:36:50,364
It was nothing. it is only a scratch.

236
00:36:50,399 --> 00:36:52,403
you look very bad my friend.

237
00:36:53,882 --> 00:36:57,019
- I should congratulate him.
- To congratulate? Why?

238
00:36:57,053 --> 00:36:59,985
- You are taking over the nightclub ?
- Quite so.

239
00:37:04,506 --> 00:37:08,602
he will retire,
You know?

240
00:37:08,637 --> 00:37:10,904
He bought a house in the north.

241
00:37:10,937 --> 00:37:14,009
He will move there...

242
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:17,044
...sit by the pool...enjoy the sun..

243
00:37:17,079 --> 00:37:21,623
Good for him. He deserves that,
Your father is a good man.

244
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:24,727
Of course, A policeman's pension
cant allow him to do things like that...

245
00:37:24,758 --> 00:37:28,020
...A policeman needs to accept
a humbler destiny.

246
00:37:28,057 --> 00:37:32,114
They cant afort all to have a place in the sun.
Or do they have?

247
00:37:33,525 --> 00:37:38,706
- I don't know if I am understanding you.
- Stop fucking arount.

248
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:40,749
I already know about the business
that you have this night.

249
00:37:41,556 --> 00:37:44,973
I could have arrested you
6 months ago for dealing drugs.

250
00:37:47,892 --> 00:37:50,225
- How much?
- I want half.

251

Let me explain something to you,
detective.

253
00:37:58,516 --> 00:38:02,131
At this time, our "mule"

254
00:38:02,163 --> 00:38:05,425
I don't know where he is.
And is probably...

255
00:38:05,461 --> 00:38:08,819
...never see him again in my life.

256
00:38:08,852 --> 00:38:11,025
I want to be paid with one way or another.

257
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:15,474

300
00:43:19,473 --> 00:43:22,960
He is a damned pimp.
A pimp!

301
00:43:22,995 --> 00:43:27,218
He made you to suck
a thousand cocks before he marry you.

Everything that I did...

I did it for you...

309
00:44:10,825 --> 00:44:12,234
and for our son.

310
00:44:13,675 --> 00:44:15,683
All the plans that have made.

311
00:44:18,251 --> 00:44:22,114
- why we cant wait?
- I wish that we can wait, but we cant.

312
00:44:23,276 --> 00:44:25,216
Everything are collapsing.

313
00:44:27,338 --> 00:44:28,418
Please.

314
00:44:29,512 --> 00:44:30,823
I am beging you.

315
00:44:33,387 --> 00:44:34,499
Help me.

316
00:44:42,217 --> 00:44:46,090
I send a man to do a job
and he disappeared.

317
00:44:46,121 --> 00:44:47,874
He disappear with what?

318
00:44:48,774 --> 00:44:49,856
With everything.

319
00:44:51,945 --> 00:44:53,731
Be more specific.

320
00:44:55,238 --> 00:44:58,088
He disappeared with the money.
A lot of money.

321
00:44:58,121 --> 00:45:00,225
A million dollars
to be exact.

322
00:45:00,935 --> 00:45:04,680
6 months ago, one of mine
girls was entertained a Russian.

323
00:45:04,712 --> 00:45:06,816
His wife came from nowhere.

324
00:45:12,164 --> 00:45:15,361
She had a wild glance in her eyes
like she had drunk blood.

325
00:45:23,876 --> 00:45:26,142
It happened so fast.

326
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:38,720
Bang!

327
00:45:41,252 --> 00:45:43,768
Shut up.

328
00:45:58,559 --> 00:46:00,948
you could have given
them to the police.

329
00:46:01,470 --> 00:46:03,382
I know, the police.

330
00:46:04,351 --> 00:46:06,392
What the fuck you think they would have done?

331
00:46:07,777 --> 00:46:11,122
Why I don't deserve
a reward in my life?

332
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:15,961
- I needed that money.
- You became a drug dealer.

333
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:21,274
I cannot help
you in this thing.

334
00:46:22,203 --> 00:46:23,284
Clear.

335
00:46:24,382 --> 00:46:26,586
I know about that.

336
00:46:27,325 --> 00:46:31,166
I was hopping if you might make 
an exception this time.

337
00:46:31,198 --> 00:46:33,368
I 'am sorry, I am not able to do this.

338
00:46:36,317 --> 00:46:37,331
I know.

339
00:46:38,715 --> 00:46:40,210
I am leaving then.

340
00:46:40,668 --> 00:46:42,642
If you dont have anything else.. ?

341
00:46:52,123 --> 00:46:53,747
Maybe you can tell me.

342
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:58,164
Does My wife love me?

343
00:46:59,479 --> 00:47:00,822
And...

344
00:47:02,492 --> 00:47:04,727
does my little boy is my son?

345
00:47:22,264 --> 00:47:24,919
- Wemba is here.
- what?

346
00:47:24,952 --> 00:47:28,116
Wemba has just arrived here.
Come to the nightclub.

347
00:47:29,942 --> 00:47:31,185
Are you well?

348
00:47:31,732 --> 00:47:33,042
Everything is well.

349
00:47:33,654 --> 00:47:36,369
Just come back to the nightclub
because he is here.

350
00:47:39,768 --> 00:47:41,258
I am already coming.

351
00:47:52,437 --> 00:47:53,711
was my wife.

352
00:47:54,645 --> 00:47:56,266
My man returned back

353
00:47:56,562 --> 00:47:58,473
I have to leave.

354
00:47:59,315 --> 00:48:01,171
And that question...

355
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:06,028
..Just forget about it.
I am not interesting anymore?

356
00:48:08,849 --> 00:48:09,964
Any way...

357
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:13,553
Good-bye, friend.

358
00:48:14,609 --> 00:48:15,593
Good-bye.

359
00:48:25,775 --> 00:48:29,008
- What ?
- Your father has just left the house.

360
00:48:29,043 --> 00:48:31,534
- I know.
- How can you know?

361
00:48:31,568 --> 00:48:35,015
Go inside there
and discover what he said.

362
00:48:59,307 --> 00:49:00,487
Do you study?

363
00:49:01,708 --> 00:49:03,463
Yes, I study.

364
00:49:05,451 --> 00:49:06,760
What are you studying ?

365
00:49:10,156 --> 00:49:13,539
A lot of things.
I take several courses.

366
00:49:14,350 --> 00:49:17,345
- I don't know.
- You dont know or you dont want to tell me?

367
00:49:21,642 --> 00:49:22,821
Bookkeeping.

368
00:49:23,912 --> 00:49:25,190
What is bookkeeping?

369
00:49:25,834 --> 00:49:29,345
it is similar to accounting.

370
00:49:30,024 --> 00:49:31,935
Why you dont studying ccounting?

371
00:49:33,961 --> 00:49:36,906
When I was girl,
I wanted to become a doctor.

372
00:49:36,941 --> 00:49:40,841
But my grandmother said that was
easier to be a nurse.

373
00:49:40,875 --> 00:49:44,584
If I wanted to be an accountant,
I could be one.

374
00:49:44,619 --> 00:49:46,120
But you want to be a clerk.

375
00:49:46,152 --> 00:49:48,158
Yes, clerk.

376
00:49:50,724 --> 00:49:52,391
What kind of job do you do now?

377
00:49:52,423 --> 00:49:55,941
can you drive quite,
please?

378
00:49:55,976 --> 00:50:00,285
thank for your help,
but I don't want to talk.

379
00:50:05,699 --> 00:50:08,326
Can we stop here?
I need to go to the bathroom.

380
00:50:08,359 --> 00:50:11,433
I am not able to.
I cannot make that.

381
00:50:11,463 --> 00:50:13,252
I cannot stop now.

382
00:50:13,286 --> 00:50:17,821
- You have to Wait until we arrived to the city.
- Please, I am tight.

383
00:50:18,243 --> 00:50:20,132
I cannot make that.

384
00:50:20,744 --> 00:50:24,351
I don't have time to stop.
Do you understand?

385
00:50:28,323 --> 00:50:29,532
I will right back.

386
00:51:02,396 --> 00:51:04,338
I will drive now.

387
00:51:07,167 --> 00:51:09,340
- Are you fealing ok?
- I am great.

388
00:51:11,519 --> 00:51:15,827
Look, I am sorry for that I said befor.
You know about for you to being a clerk.

389
00:51:16,444 --> 00:51:18,713
It should be a legal job.

390
00:51:20,991 --> 00:51:22,931
Be silence. I don't want to talk.

391
00:51:23,835 --> 00:51:27,709
I will take you to the city.
And Then, do what ever you want.

392
00:51:27,742 --> 00:51:31,771
But for the rest of the ride I dont want to talk.

393
00:51:31,805 --> 00:51:34,009
I have things
very important to do.

394
00:51:36,124 --> 00:51:38,558
Shit! He doesn't want to speak!

395
00:51:38,590 --> 00:51:40,156
- what?
- I said...

396
00:51:40,189 --> 00:51:41,822
that he doesn't want to cooperate!

397
00:51:41,854 --> 00:51:44,788
- Make him to cooperate.
- What you want me to do?

398
00:51:46,650 --> 00:51:48,092
He is an old man!

399
00:51:48,123 --> 00:51:50,715
- I want to speak with him.
- He doesn't want to speak!

400
00:51:50,749 --> 00:51:53,371
Put the telephone
in his ear!

401
00:51:53,403 --> 00:51:56,087
I will try!
But you don't scream, ok ?

402
00:52:00,891 --> 00:52:02,583
Listen here, you old bastard...

403
00:52:02,618 --> 00:52:05,717
It was a man  just in
your store.

404
00:52:06,265 --> 00:52:07,890
I know that you spoke with him.

405
00:52:08,182 --> 00:52:10,550
I want to know exactly
what you said to him.

406
00:52:10,583 --> 00:52:12,209
And I want to know now.

407
00:52:15,925 --> 00:52:16,944
I am waiting.

408
00:52:18,422 --> 00:52:22,264
That bastard resistance 
doesn't work with me,

409
00:52:22,297 --> 00:52:25,145
This is your only chance to
come out of the game clean.

410
00:52:25,177 --> 00:52:29,048
I seek a missing African
named Wemba.

411
00:52:29,082 --> 00:52:33,396
I want you to Use what ever mystic 
powers you have and....

412
00:52:33,430 --> 00:52:36,081
...tell me where
I can find him.

413
00:52:38,485 --> 00:52:40,693
I can hear you fucking breathing,
friend.

414
00:52:40,729 --> 00:52:43,860
- Rodrigo!
- What I did tell you before?

415
00:52:43,892 --> 00:52:46,195
If he doesnt cooperate,
you must kill the dog.

416
00:52:46,835 --> 00:52:47,819
what?

417
00:52:48,662 --> 00:52:50,419
I won't kill the dog.

418
00:52:50,454 --> 00:52:54,547
- yes, you will kill his dog.
- Is not good,man.. is not good!

419
00:52:54,581 --> 00:52:56,691
Let me explain something to you.

420
00:52:56,722 --> 00:52:59,122
We are fucked
if we don't find the African.

421
00:52:59,157 --> 00:53:02,259
We won't have the money.
Nor you, nor me, nor nobody.

422
00:53:02,291 --> 00:53:04,722
it is the same as we placed ourselves
in front of a train!

423
00:53:04,757 --> 00:53:05,999
you are understanding?

424
00:53:06,610 --> 00:53:07,592
I am.

425
00:53:07,952 --> 00:53:12,301
Well, take the telephone
and put it in his ear.

426
00:53:12,336 --> 00:53:15,282
Then point the weapon
at the dog.

427
00:53:15,317 --> 00:53:18,314
When I say, shoot.

428
00:53:18,863 --> 00:53:19,845
Ready?

429
00:53:21,743 --> 00:53:25,808
Listen, old man. I told to my man
tol kill your dog...

430
00:53:25,841 --> 00:53:28,742
...if you don't cooperate
and answer my questions.

431
00:53:29,649 --> 00:53:31,536
This is your fucking last chance, old man.

432
00:53:31,567 --> 00:53:34,542
Say where I can
find Wemba...

433
00:53:34,577 --> 00:53:38,950
or else I will burst the inside out
of your dog. Did you understand?

434
00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:42,418
- Rodrigo!
- Yes!

435
00:53:42,448 --> 00:53:44,454
- Kill the dog.
- But me...

436
00:53:45,166 --> 00:53:46,148

534
01:07:49,332 --> 01:07:52,759
Monique, what happed to you?
Monique!

535
01:07:52,791 --> 01:07:53,774
Monique!

536
01:07:54,582 --> 01:07:55,920
Which is your problem?

537
01:09:52,136 --> 01:09:53,410
Where is Lazar?

538
01:09:53,925 --> 01:09:56,261
- Sleeping at the Room 3.
- Lazar is fine.

539
01:09:56,711 --> 01:09:58,683
you want to read him a bedstory, to sleep?

540
01:10:02,725 --> 01:10:07,166
You realy become a picture...

541
01:10:07,813 --> 01:10:12,322
..of an old and invalid father,
did you know?

542
01:10:13,543 --> 01:10:18,972
Yes, it is true. 
Dont you want the truth to come out?

543
01:10:21,539 --> 01:10:24,094
we are a family here, are we?

544
01:10:25,218 --> 01:10:27,459
The Secrets don't exist
in a family.

545
01:10:27,490 --> 01:10:31,738
All the cards should be 
open on the table.

546
01:10:33,441 --> 01:10:34,869
Where do you want to get at?

547
01:10:35,746 --> 01:10:36,927
Without secrets.

548
01:10:39,585 --> 01:10:41,920
The honesty is
the best politic.

549
01:10:42,274 --> 01:10:44,606
The truth sall let us free.

550
01:10:46,785 --> 01:10:48,511
"You won't lie. "

551
01:10:49,504 --> 01:10:51,741
"You won't commit adultery. "

552
01:10:53,727 --> 01:10:57,076
"You won't covet the woman
of the neighbor. "

553
01:11:00,031 --> 01:11:01,406
"You won't kill. "

554
01:11:03,197 --> 01:11:06,658
Paul, your father's head is bleeding...

555
01:11:06,690 --> 01:11:08,215
He needs a doctor right now.

556
01:11:10,688 --> 01:11:15,422
what about my head? you think
that deserve any compassion?

557
01:11:17,438 --> 01:11:20,370
Did you ever told her what happend
when momm was got sick?

558
01:11:20,862 --> 01:11:23,711
Why you dont do it? Come on, tell her.

559
01:11:24,796 --> 01:11:26,937
You cant?
Then, I will...

560
01:11:29,210 --> 01:11:31,356
When the doctors cut
my mother's breasts...

561
01:11:31,389 --> 01:11:33,211
and send her home to die...

562
01:11:33,563 --> 01:11:35,323
he hired a nurse...

563
01:11:35,355 --> 01:11:38,226
to change the diapers
and to give her  morphine injections.

564
01:11:39,866 --> 01:11:42,035
One day, I was in the back yard...

565
01:11:42,458 --> 01:11:43,834
and I heard a noise.

566
01:11:45,244 --> 01:11:46,355
it seemed to me...

567
01:11:48,763 --> 01:11:50,288
like a wounded animal.

568
01:11:51,450 --> 01:11:53,339
So. I went inside the house..

569
01:11:54,587 --> 01:11:57,398
I run to my mothers room...

570
01:11:59,065 --> 01:12:01,555
and there she was her...

571
01:12:05,114 --> 01:12:07,829
making some very strange sounts..

572
01:12:08,346 --> 01:12:10,321
I couldn't understand her.

573
01:12:11,030 --> 01:12:13,169
Where is the nurse?

574
01:12:13,720 --> 01:12:16,339
I went down running and I found her.

575
01:12:17,273 --> 01:12:18,449
She was...

576
01:12:19,415 --> 01:12:22,710
in the table of the dining room,
lying on the back...

577
01:12:23,542 --> 01:12:27,634
And he was siting on his knees..

578
01:12:28,918 --> 01:12:29,932
and doing her...

579
01:12:30,486 --> 01:12:34,283
something like a gynecological exam?

580
01:12:35,987 --> 01:12:37,264
With his tongue...

581
01:12:38,710 --> 01:12:40,568
Now you know everything!

582
01:12:40,598 --> 01:12:44,435
..you can hear her upstares,
she was griping...

583
01:12:44,469 --> 01:12:48,532
..from cancer in state of 4.

584
01:12:48,567 --> 01:12:50,036
4 - C.

585
01:12:50,068 --> 01:12:52,236
Doesnt have a fucking 5.

586
01:12:53,168 --> 01:12:56,785
She couldnt breathe
nor scream... she was...

587
01:12:59,282 --> 01:13:02,289
And you didn't make anything.
you only thought...

588
01:13:02,321 --> 01:13:05,604
..how to suck the vagina
of the damned nurse.

589
01:13:07,123 --> 01:13:10,156
And now you want my compassion?

590
01:13:10,415 --> 01:13:11,693
Stop with that.

591
01:13:13,009 --> 01:13:14,254
Just Shut up.

592
01:13:15,375 --> 01:13:17,581
- You wouldnt shoot me?
- Shut up!

593
01:13:18,353 --> 01:13:19,335
Alright...

594
01:13:24,752 --> 01:13:25,831
you can shoot me

595
01:16:13,309 --> 01:16:14,903
I tried to call you..

596
01:16:17,020 --> 01:16:18,776
Did you bring the money?

597
01:16:20,989 --> 01:16:23,639
Yes, I brought them

598
01:16:24,155 --> 01:16:25,400

599
01:16:33,340 --> 01:16:35,251
Do me a favor.

600
01:16:39,547 --> 01:16:43,129
- What is?
- Take my wife...

601
01:16:43,164 --> 01:16:45,429
and my son far away from here.

602
01:16:46,489 --> 01:16:49,591
Go now, before

603
01:16:50,329 --> 01:16:52,412
