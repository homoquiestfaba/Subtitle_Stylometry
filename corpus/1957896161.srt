1
00:00:02,066 --> 00:00:02,500
This program is rated G

2
00:00:04,233 --> 00:00:07,300
and is suitable for
general audiences.

3
00:00:09,667 --> 00:00:13,033
(gentle holiday music)

4
00:00:19,734 --> 00:00:20,800
As soon as we finish stuffing

5
00:00:20,934 --> 00:00:23,333
our bellies full of
turkey and stuffing,

6
00:00:23,467 --> 00:00:26,600
we're already mentally preparing
for the main attraction.

7
00:00:26,734 --> 00:00:29,867
We make wishlists,
start planning the
perfect holiday party,

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,867
dive into piles of
peppermint goodies

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,133
and tease our kids about being
on the naughty or nice list.

10
00:00:35,266 --> 00:00:37,600
It's hard to remember
that Christmas

11
00:00:37,734 --> 00:00:40,133
isn't about tracking down
the season's hottest gadget,

12
00:00:40,266 --> 00:00:42,734
or one upping our
neighbors decorations.

13
00:00:42,867 --> 00:00:47,567
It's about honoring our roots,
reveling in the present.

14
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,000
We all spend so much
time rushing around

15
00:00:51,133 --> 00:00:54,133
to meetings and
appointments and dates,

16
00:00:54,266 --> 00:00:56,700
and for Instagram posts.

17
00:00:56,834 --> 00:01:01,834
Christmas is about
peace, not productivity.

18
00:01:03,033 --> 00:01:04,200
It should be the
only time of year

19
00:01:04,333 --> 00:01:07,700
when we're allowed to just be.

20
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,734
And that's where
Harlow Furnishings'

21
00:01:11,867 --> 00:01:14,266
new holiday accessories
line comes in.

22
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,133
We'll do all the work for you.

23
00:01:16,266 --> 00:01:20,000
You just be, because in the end,

24
00:01:20,133 --> 00:01:23,867
family is always
your best decoration.

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,867
You nailed it.

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,266
family is always
your best decoration.

27
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,033
in a city like New York.

28
00:01:29,166 --> 00:01:30,266
The Rockefeller tree,

29
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,133
the festive department
store window displays.

30
00:01:33,266 --> 00:01:35,066
I mean, Radio City Music Hall?

31
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,400
The city just bursts
with Christmas cheer.

32
00:01:37,533 --> 00:01:39,767
Sure, the city does
Christmas in style,

33
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,400
and I'm sure you also had some
great Christmases growing up.

34
00:01:42,533 --> 00:01:45,133
Well, when you've never
had a real Christmas before,

35
00:01:45,266 --> 00:01:47,200
you have a lot of
time in between

36
00:01:47,333 --> 00:01:48,800
to fill in the
blanks (chuckles).

37
00:01:48,934 --> 00:01:51,734
Your family
doesn't do Christmas?

38
00:01:51,867 --> 00:01:54,133
Well, my family owns a
Chinese restaurant in Wichita.

39
00:01:54,266 --> 00:01:56,300
It's one of the only
restaurants open for Christmas.

40
00:01:56,433 --> 00:01:59,033
So, the holidays are the
busiest time of the year.

41
00:01:59,166 --> 00:02:02,367
(bright holiday music)

42
00:02:04,133 --> 00:02:07,066
(dishes clattering)

43
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,033
(music continues)

44
00:02:18,533 --> 00:02:20,834
Now, between
now and Christmas,

45
00:02:20,967 --> 00:02:22,800
we've make thousands
of this (chuckles).

46
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:25,200
By next year I'll have the
recipe perfected (laughs).

47
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:28,266
Hey.

48
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,400
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

49
00:02:32,533 --> 00:02:35,000
Someone's yearning for
her architecture days.

50
00:02:35,133 --> 00:02:37,100
(chuckles) The
designing maybe,

51
00:02:37,233 --> 00:02:39,967
but the deadlines and
neurotic clients, never.

52
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:41,200
Oh (chuckles).
(Jane chuckles)

53
00:02:41,333 --> 00:02:42,300
Oh, Jane.

54
00:02:43,834 --> 00:02:45,700
Mm.

55
00:02:45,834 --> 00:02:47,834
I am grateful
for your moo shu.

56
00:02:47,967 --> 00:02:49,367
It's depressing cooking for one.

57
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,066
Oh.

58
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,867
I can't believe Jerry's
been gone six months.

59
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,266
You know, that new Wichita
University basketball coach

60
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,300
is just, doesn't
have the same energy.

61
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,166
How is your
daughter holding up?

62
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,100
I haven't seen her
in here lately.

63
00:03:04,133 --> 00:03:04,166
It's like nothing happened.

64
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:11,900
just spending every
waking hour at work.

65
00:03:12,033 --> 00:03:14,467
Well, she's got
that fancy CFO job.

66
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,066
Lots of responsibility.

67
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,033
That she does.

68
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,200
Oh, I guess I better get going.

69
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:22,433
Lots of errands to run.

70
00:03:23,667 --> 00:03:26,200
Only a few more
days before our...

71
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:28,300
Before my annual holiday party.

72
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:31,900
(chuckles) See
you later, Jane.

73
00:03:32,033 --> 00:03:35,233
(bright holiday music)

74
00:03:38,066 --> 00:03:39,333
I know, I know.

75
00:03:39,467 --> 00:03:41,200
I know it's not your
fault that all flights

76
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:42,900
from Hawaii have been delayed.

77
00:03:43,033 --> 00:03:45,867
I know what active
volcano warning means.

78
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,867
Yes, sweetheart?

79
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,800
I know what active
volcano warning means.

80
00:03:48,934 --> 00:03:50,266
What am I supposed
to do for Christmas?

81
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,300
Is the food ready?

82
00:03:51,433 --> 00:03:52,934
I'm starving.

83
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:53,934
Sweetheart, I know.

84
00:03:54,066 --> 00:03:55,333
Just gimme one second, please.

85
00:03:55,467 --> 00:03:57,867
Girls, do you
wanna see me guess

86
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,266
what a fortune cookie says?

87
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,400
- Yeah!
- Yeah?

88
00:04:00,533 --> 00:04:01,533
Okay, here they are.

89
00:04:01,667 --> 00:04:03,867
Which one should we do?

90
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,934
Oh, this is a hard one.

91
00:04:06,066 --> 00:04:06,934
I can do it.

92
00:04:07,066 --> 00:04:11,000
Okay (grunting), I got it.

93
00:04:11,133 --> 00:04:14,066
This fortune cookie says
that a pleasant surprise

94
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,600
is coming your way.

95
00:04:15,734 --> 00:04:17,900
Shall we see? All right?

96
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,066
All right, you read
it and tell me.

97
00:04:25,667 --> 00:04:30,033
It says, " Pleasant
surprise is coming your way."

98
00:04:30,967 --> 00:04:32,333
(chuckles) Ta da.

99
00:04:32,467 --> 00:04:35,300
(music continues)

100
00:04:37,734 --> 00:04:39,600
- Hey, Nate.
- Oh.

101
00:04:39,734 --> 00:04:41,266
Extra duck sauce for Vivian,

102
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,133
no peanuts for the Kung Pao,

103
00:04:43,266 --> 00:04:46,500
and I know Jessa's allergic.

104
00:04:46,633 --> 00:04:50,233
It's sad how well you know
us, but oddly comforting.

105
00:04:50,367 --> 00:04:52,066
So, it's just
you and the girls?

106
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,200
Yep.

107
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:54,467
And I'm still
trying to figure out

108
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,867
how to make a decent lunch

109
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,133
while pulling off a
mediocre French braid.

110
00:04:58,266 --> 00:04:59,533
(Nate chuckles)
(Jim chuckles)

111
00:04:59,667 --> 00:05:01,900
I'm sorry, Nate (laughs).

112
00:05:02,033 --> 00:05:03,567
It's all good.

113
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,400
I promised the girls
the best holiday ever,

114
00:05:05,533 --> 00:05:07,567
and that's exactly what
I'm gonna give 'em.

115
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,300
Nonstop fun, fun, fun.

116
00:05:10,533 --> 00:05:12,433
Wish me luck.

117
00:05:12,567 --> 00:05:14,600
Working up a sweat and
it's not even dinner time.

118
00:05:14,734 --> 00:05:18,000
Busiest we've ever been,
and that's saying a lot.

119
00:05:18,133 --> 00:05:18,900
There you go.

120
00:05:19,033 --> 00:05:19,667
Oh.

121
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,266
Princeton?

122
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,533
And it's thick.

123
00:05:26,667 --> 00:05:27,700
You know what that means?

124
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,600
This is the fourth early
admission letter you've gotten,

125
00:05:31,734 --> 00:05:34,000
all from amazing colleges.

126
00:05:34,133 --> 00:05:35,400
Not like I can go anyways,
so what's the point?

127
00:05:35,533 --> 00:05:36,533
Oh, Miguel.

128
00:05:36,667 --> 00:05:38,200
My pops would
freak if he found out

129
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:41,200
I was getting accepted to
all these fancy schools.

130
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:44,000
Probably try and do something
crazy to gimme the money.

131
00:05:44,133 --> 00:05:46,600
Did you apply to that
scholarship Jane told me about?

132
00:05:46,734 --> 00:05:49,200
I got my interview tomorrow.

133
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:50,667
Oh, Miguel, that's wonderful.

134
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,066
(Miguel chuckles)

135
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:57,200
(bells jingling)
(bright holiday music)

136
00:05:57,333 --> 00:05:59,166
I thought your doctor
said you weren't supposed

137
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:02,133
to be eating anything
spicy, salty, or fried?

138
00:06:02,266 --> 00:06:05,734
I had a stroke, not
a taste bud removal.

139
00:06:05,867 --> 00:06:07,467
Besides, I'm fine.

140
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,600
How'd you sneak outta
your house anyways?

141
00:06:10,734 --> 00:06:13,400
My therapist thinks
I'm in the bathroom.

142
00:06:13,533 --> 00:06:14,667
Just gimme my pork fried rice.

143
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,600
(chuckles) Thanks, Mr. Barber.

144
00:06:20,133 --> 00:06:21,667
[Beth] Thank you.

145
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,967
Hey.

146
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:23,734
Thanks.

147
00:06:23,867 --> 00:06:25,467
You're such a lifesaver.

148
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,200
Oh, thank you.

149
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:28,667
Finally, you're
my last delivery,

150
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,500
so hopefully I'll be
able to feel my fingers

151
00:06:30,633 --> 00:06:31,367
before I go to bed.

152
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,333
Oh (chuckles).

153
00:06:32,467 --> 00:06:33,700
- See you.
- Bye.

154
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,333
(Miguel sighs)
(bright holiday music)

155
00:06:39,467 --> 00:06:41,333
Daily dose of lo mein.

156
00:06:41,467 --> 00:06:42,633
Oh, thank God.

157
00:06:42,767 --> 00:06:44,100
I skipped breakfast this morning

158
00:06:44,233 --> 00:06:46,200
to get an early start
and I have a late night.

159
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:48,066
Do you ever not
have a late night?

160
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,100
Tech is a 24/7 business.

161
00:06:50,233 --> 00:06:53,333
Innovation doesn't stop just
because it's late December,

162
00:06:53,467 --> 00:06:55,600
but just because I'm
burning the midnight oil

163
00:06:55,734 --> 00:06:58,000
doesn't mean
everyone needs to be.

164
00:06:58,133 --> 00:06:59,266
Head home early, Beth.

165
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,600
Your vacation starts tomorrow.

166
00:07:00,734 --> 00:07:02,333
The holidays with
three little ones?

167
00:07:02,467 --> 00:07:04,133
I'd hardly call that a vacation.

168
00:07:04,266 --> 00:07:07,533
You're so lucky you get to
have a nice simple Christmas.

169
00:07:07,667 --> 00:07:08,700
Lucky me.

170
00:07:08,834 --> 00:07:09,734
Merry Christmas, Beth.

171
00:07:09,867 --> 00:07:10,600
[Beth] You too.

172
00:07:10,734 --> 00:07:13,633
(melancholy music)

173
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:23,300
(Veronica exhales)

174
00:07:23,433 --> 00:07:25,200
Okay.

175
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:26,433
I wrote down like a dozen orders

176
00:07:26,567 --> 00:07:28,367
and they're all
over the city, so...

177
00:07:30,734 --> 00:07:32,266
Where'd you get that?

178
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,734
It was hidden in
the deep dark corner

179
00:07:33,867 --> 00:07:35,333
of the walk-in freezer.

180
00:07:35,467 --> 00:07:36,800
Oh.

181
00:07:36,934 --> 00:07:38,467
How'd you find that?

182
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,300
Saw you cook it
and hide it there.

183
00:07:41,433 --> 00:07:43,033
I was just messing around.

184
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:44,734
My dad's the chef.

185
00:07:44,867 --> 00:07:46,100
Come on, dude.

186
00:07:46,233 --> 00:07:48,367
My dad's the chef.

187
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:49,367
What is this? It's amazing.

188
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,333
It's tasty.

189
00:07:56,467 --> 00:07:57,734
Not like it matters.

190
00:07:57,867 --> 00:08:00,467
My dad doesn't even know
that I want to be a chef.

191
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,400
I mean, I could be wrong,

192
00:08:02,533 --> 00:08:04,600
but I think there are
other restaurants.

193
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:07,834
(contemplative music)

194
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:15,600
Let's see which annoying
customer interrupted
my only break.

195
00:08:15,734 --> 00:08:18,133
That annoying
customer would be me.

196
00:08:18,266 --> 00:08:19,367
Sadie!

197
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,367
Hi.

198
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,867
Rick, hey.

199
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:25,200
It's been awhile.

200
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:26,367
Yeah, it has.

201
00:08:28,533 --> 00:08:29,266
Is that mine (chuckles)?

202
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,100
Oh, yeah.

203
00:08:31,233 --> 00:08:32,667
Here you go (chuckles).

204
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,200
No big Hanukkah dinner tonight?

205
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:36,734
My dad always burns the latkes

206
00:08:36,867 --> 00:08:39,467
and the brisket is so dry
we could use it as kindling,

207
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,867
so these are reinforcements.

208
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,133
Just like the old days, huh?

209
00:08:44,266 --> 00:08:45,633
I remember when you
used to work here,

210
00:08:45,767 --> 00:08:47,734
there'd be a lot of leftovers
going to the Cohen house.

211
00:08:47,867 --> 00:08:50,100
This place definitely
saved my appetite

212
00:08:50,233 --> 00:08:51,633
and my sanity more than once.

213
00:08:52,767 --> 00:08:54,266
You still at UCLA?

214
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,233
Senior year.

215
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,734
What about you?

216
00:08:56,867 --> 00:08:58,233
When did you get back?

217
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:00,467
Oh no, I'm just
chilling here in Wichita.

218
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,433
Staying with my folks.

219
00:09:02,567 --> 00:09:05,533
(sighs) We haven't seen
each other in person since-

220
00:09:05,667 --> 00:09:07,433
You ditched me
right before prom.

221
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,333
Oh, I'm so sorry, Sadie.

222
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:12,567
I was already in college.

223
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:15,867
My frat brothers told me
it was a little pathetic

224
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,934
to be slow dancing in my
high school gym (chuckles).

225
00:09:18,066 --> 00:09:19,834
Could have shared that
with me before I bought

226
00:09:19,967 --> 00:09:21,934
a dress that I couldn't return

227
00:09:22,066 --> 00:09:24,967
because it was stained with
tears and Cheeto fingerprints.

228
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,567
I thought you only asked me

229
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:30,600
because you wanted your
first dance to be chill.

230
00:09:30,734 --> 00:09:32,633
Go with a friend, no pressure.

231
00:09:33,934 --> 00:09:35,934
Not exactly.

232
00:09:36,066 --> 00:09:42,433
Hey, can we catch up
maybe tonight or tomorrow?

233
00:09:42,567 --> 00:09:44,667
I'm pretty busy with family
stuff before I head back.

234
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,333
You gotta let me make
up for being such a jerk.

235
00:09:47,467 --> 00:09:48,567
We can reintroduce you

236
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:51,934
to good old Midwestern
holiday shenanigans.

237
00:09:52,066 --> 00:09:53,467
That does sound tempting.

238
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:59,734
(Rick chuckles)
(gentle music)

239
00:09:59,867 --> 00:10:01,934
I am loving the romantic
vibe, but you've done too much.

240
00:10:02,066 --> 00:10:04,533
I don't want to set off
your smoke detector.

241
00:10:04,667 --> 00:10:06,734
It's our last night
together before the holidays.

242
00:10:06,867 --> 00:10:09,800
I wanted to do
something special.

243
00:10:09,934 --> 00:10:11,600
You know, savor
her this last shred

244
00:10:11,734 --> 00:10:14,600
of cheer before soy sauce
servitude (chuckles).

245
00:10:14,734 --> 00:10:19,700
Okay, this may be crazy,
but come to Vermont with me.

246
00:10:21,433 --> 00:10:23,300
You want me to spend
Christmas with your family?

247
00:10:23,433 --> 00:10:26,266
I know it's a huge step
and it's totally last minute,

248
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,700
but I've already rented a car

249
00:10:27,834 --> 00:10:30,767
and my family's been wanting
to meet you for ages.

250
00:10:32,066 --> 00:10:35,467
That sounds so amazing.

251
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,567
It's just that it's
the busiest week

252
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:38,934
of the year for the restaurant,

253
00:10:39,066 --> 00:10:42,300
and my parents would
kill me for bailing.

254
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:43,867
Plus I would feel
horrible about having

255
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,567
so much fun while they were
knee deep in dumplings.

256
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:47,500
I get it.

257
00:10:48,867 --> 00:10:56,400
Maybe next year, hm?

258
00:10:56,533 --> 00:11:00,333
You remember the year Romy
wanted a Barbie Dreamhouse?

259
00:11:00,467 --> 00:11:02,834
The one with the pink
convertible (chuckles).

260
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,633
We didn't get to
the mall till New Year

261
00:11:06,767 --> 00:11:07,667
and it was all sold out.

262
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,533
(sighs) She cried all day.

263
00:11:09,667 --> 00:11:10,667
Yeah.

264
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,600
(Sue chuckles)
(Jim chuckles)

265
00:11:11,734 --> 00:11:13,000
Look, this from Mrs. Wilson.

266
00:11:13,133 --> 00:11:13,967
Oh.

267
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,767
Look, this from Mrs. Wilson.

268
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,934
All our lovely customers.

269
00:11:20,066 --> 00:11:21,533
I can't believe how
much they've added

270
00:11:21,667 --> 00:11:22,934
to this tree over the years.

271
00:11:23,066 --> 00:11:24,867
Yes, even if we didn't
have a tree at home,

272
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,600
we always got this one.

273
00:11:26,734 --> 00:11:29,500
(Sue chuckling)

274
00:11:31,667 --> 00:11:34,233
I wish there was a way
to make it up to the kids.

275
00:11:34,367 --> 00:11:36,467
Let them have a
proper Christmas.

276
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,000
Enjoy the season
without thinking

277
00:11:38,133 --> 00:11:41,934
about busing tables
or unloading supplies.

278
00:11:42,066 --> 00:11:45,467
(phone ringing)

279
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,400
Ah.

280
00:11:46,533 --> 00:11:47,533
It's Romy.

281
00:11:47,667 --> 00:11:50,867
Oh, the new tap's here.

282
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:51,900
Hi, honey.

283
00:11:52,033 --> 00:11:53,533
How are you?

284
00:11:53,667 --> 00:11:55,867
Crushed my presentation
and celebrated with Blake.

285
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,100
Ah!

286
00:11:57,233 --> 00:12:00,333
Crushed my presentation
and celebrated with Blake.

287
00:12:00,467 --> 00:12:01,800
Asked me to join.

288
00:12:01,934 --> 00:12:03,900
Oh, that's a huge
step (chuckles).

289
00:12:05,467 --> 00:12:07,800
It would've been so magical,
not just to meet his family,

290
00:12:07,934 --> 00:12:10,867
but to experience
a real Christmas.

291
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,467
(playful music)

292
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,100
Maybe you should go, honey.

293
00:12:16,834 --> 00:12:19,066
I think my wifi glitched

294
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:23,433
because I thought I heard you
say I should go with Blake.

295
00:12:23,567 --> 00:12:24,700
We've got the Dragon covered,

296
00:12:24,834 --> 00:12:27,333
so have an amazing
Christmas with Blake.

297
00:12:27,467 --> 00:12:28,066
Ah (squeals)!

298
00:12:30,867 --> 00:12:31,600
Really?

299
00:12:31,734 --> 00:12:34,967
(bright holiday music)

300
00:12:46,467 --> 00:12:47,867
Hey, Dr. Cohen.

301
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,800
(indistinct)

302
00:12:49,934 --> 00:12:52,066
Happiest of
holidays to you too.

303
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,033
We missed you at
our cocktail party.

304
00:12:55,867 --> 00:12:57,867
So, how did we do?

305
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,667
Unfortunately,
none of the embryos

306
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,033
made it through the blast.

307
00:13:02,633 --> 00:13:02,667
But we had four
of them this time.

308
00:13:06,066 --> 00:13:08,700
The numbers just
weren't on our side.

309
00:13:08,834 --> 00:13:11,867
I'm so sorry.

310
00:13:13,166 --> 00:13:16,600
I really wish that I
had better news for you.

311
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:21,934
It looks really fresh today.

312
00:13:22,066 --> 00:13:23,900
I got lucky at the
market this morning.

313
00:13:24,033 --> 00:13:26,467
(Rick laughs)
(Jim laughs)

314
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,467
Have you heard from
your sister yet?

315
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,467
Just phone taggin'.

316
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,600
Well, this is the first guy

317
00:13:31,734 --> 00:13:33,600
that she's been
really serious about.

318
00:13:33,734 --> 00:13:35,600
Yeah, he seems okay.

319
00:13:35,734 --> 00:13:37,600
Every time we talk
he's bugging me

320
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:40,400
to start an IRA or
buy mutual funds

321
00:13:40,533 --> 00:13:42,133
or something incredibly boring.

322
00:13:42,266 --> 00:13:43,734
He has a good career,

323
00:13:43,867 --> 00:13:45,667
and he's only a few
years older than you-

324
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,867
Dad.

325
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,667
and he's only a few
years older than you-

326
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,967
I have had a job,
at the restaurant.

327
00:13:54,867 --> 00:13:57,533
(sighs) Have you considered
that I actually like cooking?

328
00:13:57,667 --> 00:13:59,133
What would you
do with your life

329
00:13:59,266 --> 00:14:01,066
if the restaurant isn't around?

330
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,000
(chuckles) Yeah, right.

331
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:04,800
Like the two biggest
workaholics I know

332
00:14:04,934 --> 00:14:07,600
are gonna decide to
close up and relax?

333
00:14:07,734 --> 00:14:09,166
(laughs) Nice.

334
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,800
(gentle music)

335
00:14:30,266 --> 00:14:32,200
I think you dropped this.

336
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:33,867
Oh, thanks Jack.

337
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,600
Spec, Zuma and Spector?

338
00:14:36,734 --> 00:14:37,467
You actually read this?

339
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,800
Just keep it, okay?

340
00:14:38,934 --> 00:14:41,567
(gentle music)

341
00:14:44,567 --> 00:14:51,800
(music continues)

342
00:14:51,934 --> 00:14:52,767
Thank you for staying late.

343
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:55,100
(music continues)

344
00:14:58,133 --> 00:15:01,633
When Sue and I first
arrived in Kansas,

345
00:15:01,767 --> 00:15:04,133
we were petrified and we knew

346
00:15:04,266 --> 00:15:07,066
the bonds that the
food can create.

347
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,633
And over time,

348
00:15:08,767 --> 00:15:13,166
Wichita became home and
you became our family,

349
00:15:15,266 --> 00:15:17,767
which makes it even harder to...

350
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:20,266
We're closing the
restaurant for good.

351
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,934
The last day will
be Christmas Eve.

352
00:15:22,066 --> 00:15:27,033
(employees murmuring)
(melancholy music)

353
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,734
We know this is
tough news to hear.

354
00:15:29,867 --> 00:15:32,867
You know, we are
old, we are tired,

355
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,900
and we move slower
and we hurt more.

356
00:15:36,033 --> 00:15:37,800
We'd love to keep
the restaurant open,

357
00:15:37,934 --> 00:15:41,533
but you just know when
a chapter is ending.

358
00:15:41,667 --> 00:15:44,000
Your envelopes include
a month of severance.

359
00:15:44,133 --> 00:15:45,934
Why close the day
before Christmas?

360
00:15:46,066 --> 00:15:47,600
It's our busiest day.

361
00:15:47,734 --> 00:15:50,133
We want you to spend
Christmas with your loved ones.

362
00:15:50,266 --> 00:15:52,200
It's something you haven't
done for a long time.

363
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:54,266
But some of us need this job.

364
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,734
We'll help you
find other jobs,

365
00:15:56,867 --> 00:15:59,033
give you glowing recommendations.

366
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:00,367
What are you gonna do?

367
00:16:01,367 --> 00:16:01,400
This restaurant is your life.

368
00:16:05,266 --> 00:16:09,800
to some developers and we've
bought a house in Flagstaff.

369
00:16:09,934 --> 00:16:10,834
On a golf course.

370
00:16:14,233 --> 00:16:15,333
Seriously, guys?

371
00:16:15,467 --> 00:16:18,066
You sold the Dragon and
we're moving to Arizona

372
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,667
and you didn't
think it'd be nice

373
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,734
to tell me before you
drop that bomb in public?

374
00:16:21,867 --> 00:16:23,266
Sometimes it's hard for people

375
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,967
to move on without momentum.

376
00:16:26,934 --> 00:16:26,967
What's that supposed to mean?

377
00:16:32,367 --> 00:16:35,567
and ended up in Wichita
because I had a third cousin

378
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:36,967
who owned a restaurant here.

379
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,066
We didn't know
anything about cooking

380
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,600
or have passion for food really.

381
00:16:42,734 --> 00:16:45,100
But we learned our way
around the kitchen very quickly

382
00:16:45,233 --> 00:16:47,266
because we had to make a living

383
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:50,100
and provide a good
future for our kids.

384
00:16:50,233 --> 00:16:52,333
Thinking back, we
shouldn't have let the Dragon

385
00:16:52,467 --> 00:16:56,600
take over yours and
Romy's childhood.

386
00:16:56,734 --> 00:16:58,700
We wanted to keep
you guys close to us.

387
00:16:58,834 --> 00:17:00,934
We didn't want you to end
up toiling your lives away

388
00:17:01,066 --> 00:17:03,266
in a greasy kitchen like we did.

389
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,400
But I like working here.

390
00:17:05,533 --> 00:17:09,800
You've used a restaurant
as a crutch for too long.

391
00:17:09,934 --> 00:17:11,700
You need to create
your own path.

392
00:17:14,467 --> 00:17:14,500
Who's gonna tell Romy?

393
00:17:19,066 --> 00:17:20,133
in stupid Vermont?

394
00:17:20,266 --> 00:17:22,133
We'll tell her
after the holiday.

395
00:17:23,133 --> 00:17:27,066
No, I get it more than anyone,

396
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:30,133
but she would want to be
here for a real Christmas

397
00:17:30,266 --> 00:17:31,367
with her real family.

398
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:35,867
but she would want to be
here for a real Christmas

399
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,800
It's done, it's done.

400
00:17:40,066 --> 00:17:40,100
(Rick sighs)

401
00:17:53,934 --> 00:17:56,834
(music continues)

402
00:17:56,967 --> 00:17:59,333
I can't believe
you grew up here.

403
00:17:59,467 --> 00:18:03,533
Your Christmases must
have been so wonderful.

404
00:18:03,667 --> 00:18:06,433
Carols around the piano,
snowball fights in the yard,

405
00:18:06,567 --> 00:18:09,166
presents under a
freshly picked tree

406
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:12,000
with just the right ratio
of tinsel and ornaments.

407
00:18:12,133 --> 00:18:14,800
Somebody's watched too
many Christmas movies.

408
00:18:14,934 --> 00:18:17,133
All my life I've wanted
to anticipate Christmas

409
00:18:17,266 --> 00:18:18,467
instead of dreading it.

410
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,166
Other kids got to spend
Christmas baking cookies

411
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:24,200
and building snowmen
and opening presents.

412
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:26,433
We spent Christmas
slinging egg foo young

413
00:18:26,567 --> 00:18:28,300
and refilling jasmine tea.

414
00:18:30,033 --> 00:18:30,934
My parents were too busy

415
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:39,033
So, this will be my
first real Christmas,

416
00:18:39,166 --> 00:18:40,433
like ever (laughs).

417
00:18:44,133 --> 00:18:48,166
Oh!
- Mom, Dad, this is Romy.

418
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:49,033
Nice to meet you.

419
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:50,200
Welcome to our home.

420
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:52,033
We have heard such
wonderful things.

421
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:53,000
Oh!

422
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:55,333
So nice to meet you.

423
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:01,500
Wow, that is so
thoughtful, Romy.

424
00:19:01,633 --> 00:19:05,000
Would you mind if I keep
this outside on the porch?

425
00:19:07,633 --> 00:19:09,400
Our Moxie gets into everything

426
00:19:09,533 --> 00:19:12,100
and poinsettias can
be toxic to animals.

427
00:19:15,266 --> 00:19:17,500
Yeah, no worries
(laughs nervously).

428
00:19:17,633 --> 00:19:18,934
I totally get it.

429
00:19:19,066 --> 00:19:20,467
- Well, let's get inside.
- Yeah!

430
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,333
Great.

431
00:19:21,467 --> 00:19:23,967
(gentle music)

432
00:19:30,467 --> 00:19:33,633
(bright holiday music)

433
00:19:38,533 --> 00:19:41,467
You have such a lovely
home, Mrs. Bennett.

434
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,066
Thank you, but
please, call me Tinsley.

435
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:45,433
Oh my, and what
a beautiful tree.

436
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:54,066
Oh, but it looks so real.

437
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,233
Where is everybody?

438
00:19:56,367 --> 00:19:56,400
Outback building a snowman.

439
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,467
- Always look for-
- Uncle Blake!

440
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:05,400
Hey! Oh!
(Jen laughs)

441
00:20:05,533 --> 00:20:07,100
Hi, you must be Bridgett!

442
00:20:07,233 --> 00:20:08,967
- And who are you?
- Bridgett.

443
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,200
I am so sorry.

444
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:13,066
- And who are you?
- Bridgett.

445
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,467
I'm Dylan, Blake's brother.

446
00:20:15,533 --> 00:20:16,367
- I'm Jen, the sister-in-law.
- Oh!

447
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,200
- Hey.
- So nice

448
00:20:17,333 --> 00:20:18,233
to meet you in person.

449
00:20:18,367 --> 00:20:20,133
- Oh.
- Nice to meet you.

450
00:20:20,266 --> 00:20:22,133
Yeah, we were startin' to
think you were like Pearl.

451
00:20:22,266 --> 00:20:23,066
Pearl?

452
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,533
Blake's imaginary friend.

453
00:20:24,667 --> 00:20:26,400
Oh, from when he was little?

454
00:20:26,533 --> 00:20:27,266
[Dylan] Try 12.

455
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,633
Hey, let's zip it.

456
00:20:30,066 --> 00:20:31,133
You know what?

457
00:20:31,266 --> 00:20:33,200
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

458
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:34,200
Oh!

459
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:36,133
This is what you get!

460
00:20:36,266 --> 00:20:37,066
Oh!

461
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,500
Oh, oh, oh.

462
00:20:38,633 --> 00:20:39,767
Are you okay?

463
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:43,900
Oh, oh, oh.

464
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:46,467
I'm (chuckles)...

465
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,600
Sorry.
- It's all right.

466
00:20:47,734 --> 00:20:50,934
It's okay (chuckles).

467
00:20:51,066 --> 00:20:52,000
Yes, please, thank you.

468
00:20:52,133 --> 00:20:53,533
I'm gonna need those.

469
00:20:53,667 --> 00:20:55,266
Hey (speaking faintly).

470
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,367
Let's go.

471
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,600
- (gasps) Oh my gosh!
- Oh my God.

472
00:20:57,734 --> 00:20:59,600
- I'm so sorry, Nate.
- Oh no, I'm so sorry.

473
00:20:59,734 --> 00:21:01,533
[Veronica and Nate]
I didn't see you there.

474
00:21:01,667 --> 00:21:03,166
(Veronica laughs)
(Nate laughs)

475
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:04,133
Oh...

476
00:21:04,266 --> 00:21:05,333
Oh, thank you (chuckles).

477
00:21:05,467 --> 00:21:08,900
Oh...

478
00:21:09,033 --> 00:21:10,333
I thought you were
taking the week off

479
00:21:10,467 --> 00:21:12,200
for some family fun time.

480
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:13,133
Yeah-

481
00:21:13,266 --> 00:21:14,667
Daddy, can I have the markers?

482
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,000
Yes, you can.

483
00:21:16,133 --> 00:21:17,200
Yes, here honey.

484
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:19,000
Here. There you go.

485
00:21:19,133 --> 00:21:20,000
Hi, Veronica.

486
00:21:20,133 --> 00:21:21,567
- Hi.
- I like your shoes.

487
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,233
Oh, these old things?

488
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,400
They feel just like
butter on my feet.

489
00:21:26,533 --> 00:21:27,266
I'm kidding.

490
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,433
They're awful.

491
00:21:28,567 --> 00:21:29,667
Don't ever throw
away your sneakers.

492
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,333
So what are you guys doing here?

493
00:21:34,467 --> 00:21:35,333
We were just-

494
00:21:35,467 --> 00:21:37,400
So what are you guys doing here?

495
00:21:37,533 --> 00:21:40,066
Now dad wants to take us
to some boring museum.

496
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:44,033
(chuckles) The
Children's Museum.

497
00:21:44,166 --> 00:21:45,467
So, hosting an event

498
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,133
where they celebrate
Christmas traditions

499
00:21:47,266 --> 00:21:48,600
from around the world.

500
00:21:48,734 --> 00:21:51,400
It's gonna be nonstop
food and drink.

501
00:21:51,533 --> 00:21:52,934
Plenty of fun.

502
00:21:53,066 --> 00:21:55,066
Just the opposite
of boring, Jessa.

503
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,266
And they have a make your
own wreath competition,

504
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,667
which is why we are gathering
some supplies from reception.

505
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,500
I hope that's not
an HR violation.

506
00:22:04,767 --> 00:22:07,100
Well, last week I may
or may not have taken

507
00:22:07,233 --> 00:22:08,533
some paper towels
from the break room

508
00:22:08,667 --> 00:22:11,100
because I was too tired to
go to the grocery store,

509
00:22:11,233 --> 00:22:12,400
so your secret's safe with me.

510
00:22:12,533 --> 00:22:14,500
- Okay.
- Dad, I'm hungry.

511
00:22:14,633 --> 00:22:16,400
- Huh?
- I'm hungry.

512
00:22:16,533 --> 00:22:18,400
Right. Yes, yes, of course.

513
00:22:18,533 --> 00:22:21,233
Well, how about we
get some takeout

514
00:22:21,367 --> 00:22:22,467
from the Dragon on the way home?

515
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:25,233
(sighs) You better
savor those dishes.

516
00:22:25,367 --> 00:22:26,200
I know, right?

517
00:22:26,333 --> 00:22:27,333
Jim and Sue are like family.

518
00:22:27,467 --> 00:22:29,633
It's been like my second home.

519
00:22:29,767 --> 00:22:31,333
I thought this place
was your second home.

520
00:22:31,467 --> 00:22:32,734
Ha ha (chuckles).

521
00:22:32,867 --> 00:22:34,400
Sometimes it feels that way.

522
00:22:34,533 --> 00:22:36,367
Well, that's how
you became CFO,

523
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,400
which is awesome, by the way.

524
00:22:37,533 --> 00:22:38,266
Congratulations.

525
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,200
Not like me.

526
00:22:39,333 --> 00:22:40,467
I'm just a lowly engineer.

527
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,333
Lowly engineer? No way.

528
00:22:42,467 --> 00:22:44,066
Nate, you're brilliant.

529
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,533
You're one of the most talented
designers in the company.

530
00:22:46,667 --> 00:22:49,133
Oh, thank you for saying that.

531
00:22:49,266 --> 00:22:50,367
Daddy, look.

532
00:22:52,667 --> 00:22:54,400
No, no, sweetheart.

533
00:22:54,533 --> 00:22:55,467
No, no, no, no, no.

534
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,467
Do not do that.

535
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,066
Those are...

536
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,467
(sighs) I'm sorry.

537
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,200
It's okay.

538
00:23:02,333 --> 00:23:03,333
It's beautiful.

539
00:23:03,467 --> 00:23:06,100
(gentle music)

540
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,667
(line trilling)

541
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,667
[Sue] Golden Dragon.

542
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,266
Hi, Sue.

543
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,367
I wanted to order
something for my mom.

544
00:23:23,934 --> 00:23:26,400
Oh, I know your
interview is at three,

545
00:23:26,533 --> 00:23:28,200
but is there time
for you to squeeze

546
00:23:28,333 --> 00:23:29,800
in one more delivery
on your way?

547
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:38,734
(doorbell rings)
(Miguel knocking)

548
00:23:38,867 --> 00:23:39,600
What are you doing here?

549
00:23:39,734 --> 00:23:40,533
I didn't order anything.

550
00:23:40,667 --> 00:23:41,834
This is for you.

551
00:23:42,867 --> 00:23:42,900
This note came with it.

552
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:45,734
"Send

553
00:23:47,667 --> 00:23:50,400
before the Dragon
closes this week."

554
00:23:50,533 --> 00:23:51,367
Closes?

555
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,800
Sue never said a peep.

556
00:23:53,934 --> 00:23:55,533
Yeah, it was a
shock to all of us.

557
00:23:55,667 --> 00:23:57,333
(Jane gasps)

558
00:23:57,467 --> 00:23:58,834
Okay, I'll see you later.

559
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,200
That's really unsafe.

560
00:24:03,333 --> 00:24:06,367
I know, Jerry used to take
care of all those kinda things.

561
00:24:09,734 --> 00:24:10,867
Let me fix that for you.

562
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,266
- Really?
- Yeah, yeah.

563
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,367
[Jane] Aw.

564
00:24:16,233 --> 00:24:17,233
Okay, all set.

565
00:24:17,367 --> 00:24:18,200
(Jane chuckles)

566
00:24:18,333 --> 00:24:19,533
Thank you. Looks great.

567
00:24:19,667 --> 00:24:20,600
Now, if you'll excuse me,

568
00:24:20,734 --> 00:24:21,533
I'm running late for like

569
00:24:21,667 --> 00:24:23,633
Now, if you'll excuse me,

570
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,200
(fabric rips)
(Miguel gasps)

571
00:24:26,333 --> 00:24:27,467
Oh no!

572
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,600
Miguel, are you okay?

573
00:24:30,734 --> 00:24:32,734
(Miguel sighs)
(playful music)

574
00:24:32,867 --> 00:24:37,266
(gentle music)

575
00:24:44,734 --> 00:24:47,233
Ms. Roberts, I am so sorry.

576
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:48,400
(Miguel sighs)

577
00:24:54,867 --> 00:24:57,467
It is now 3:18.

578
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,467
- I was working and I-
- That's okay.

579
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,233
Let's just get on with it.

580
00:25:01,367 --> 00:25:02,633
Cool?
- Yeah.

581
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,934
Good grades,
great test scores.

582
00:25:08,066 --> 00:25:09,400
Thank you, Ma'am.

583
00:25:09,533 --> 00:25:11,900
But your extracurriculars,
where are they?

584
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,367
I work 30 hours a week,
plus all AP classes.

585
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:17,533
I don't exactly have time
for the debate team, so-

586
00:25:17,667 --> 00:25:19,867
What about your
community service?

587
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,033
Volunteer positions?

588
00:25:22,667 --> 00:25:25,233
Does playing bingo
with some feisty ladies

589
00:25:25,367 --> 00:25:27,000
at the nursing home
count (chuckles)?

590
00:25:33,867 --> 00:25:35,734
This scholarship is
given by my company

591
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:38,000
to someone who is involved
with their community

592
00:25:38,133 --> 00:25:39,834
in a deep and meaningful way.

593
00:25:41,867 --> 00:25:43,033
You're a nice young man, Miguel,

594
00:25:51,934 --> 00:25:54,700
Thanks.
(phone ringing)

595
00:25:56,934 --> 00:25:59,467
Hi, Mom.
- Thank you for the moo shu.

596
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,934
I know how much you love it.

597
00:26:01,066 --> 00:26:02,834
We had those lovely
Sunday night dinners

598
00:26:02,967 --> 00:26:04,934
there with your dad.

599
00:26:05,066 --> 00:26:07,500
On the rare occasions
when he would show up.

600
00:26:09,066 --> 00:26:11,400
Well, the portions are so big,

601
00:26:11,533 --> 00:26:13,700
wanna come over and
share it with me tonight?

602
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,066
How 'bout tomorrow?

603
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,333
I could help you
prep for the party.

604
00:26:18,467 --> 00:26:19,667
Be there in the afternoon.

605
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:20,600
(phone beeps)

606
00:26:20,734 --> 00:26:22,333
(phone beeping)
(Jane sighs)

607
00:26:22,467 --> 00:26:24,300
(solemn music)

608
00:26:24,433 --> 00:26:26,900
(Jane exhales)

609
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:37,066
Oh my gosh, I am so excited
for these roasts chestnuts.

610
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,000
They only have them
this time of year, Dad.

611
00:26:39,133 --> 00:26:40,567
Like only once.

612
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:41,533
I know.

613
00:26:41,667 --> 00:26:43,467
Like only once.

614
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,967
in cinnamon and sugar
or the spicy ones

615
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,533
that burn your tongue.

616
00:26:47,667 --> 00:26:48,533
Which are your favorite?

617
00:26:48,667 --> 00:26:51,667
that burn your tongue.

618
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,567
[Nate] Oh, how very
traditional of you.

619
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:55,066
I'm a traditional girl, Daddy.

620
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,667
You are, are ya?

621
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:57,867
Mom usually brings
us first thing

622
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,066
in the morning 'cause
they sell out fast.

623
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,934
Yeah, it'll be fine.
They're just chestnuts.

624
00:27:02,066 --> 00:27:05,000
Um...

625
00:27:05,133 --> 00:27:06,467
You've gotta be...

626
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,633
It's not even noon.

627
00:27:08,667 --> 00:27:11,533
Told you, Dad.

628
00:27:11,667 --> 00:27:12,600
Okay, a little less attitude
would be great, Jessa.

629
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,667
Having a fun vacation
would be great.

630
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:18,667
Are you?

631
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,066
All we've done is have fun.

632
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,000
Just because you take
us to lots of places

633
00:27:22,133 --> 00:27:24,533
and spend lots of money on
us does not make it fun.

634
00:27:24,667 --> 00:27:27,100
(solemn music)

635
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:29,633
Okay, fine.

636
00:27:33,467 --> 00:27:36,400
I wanna practice my lines
for the Christmas pageant,

637
00:27:36,533 --> 00:27:37,500
and just go home.

638
00:27:39,934 --> 00:27:42,934
Okay.

639
00:27:43,066 --> 00:27:43,800
Come on.

640
00:27:43,934 --> 00:27:46,834
(music continues)

641
00:27:53,934 --> 00:27:57,000
Sure this is your
childhood bedroom?

642
00:27:57,133 --> 00:27:58,200
Pretty sure, yeah.

643
00:27:58,333 --> 00:28:00,934
Sure this is your
childhood bedroom?

644
00:28:01,066 --> 00:28:03,967
and they fit right back into
their teenage environment.

645
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:09,033
You know, like walls plastered
with posters of muscle cars,

646
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:13,467
shelves lined with trophies,
beds with Star War sheets.

647
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,734
I wasn't really
a Star Wars fan.

648
00:28:14,867 --> 00:28:16,133
And we're supposed to
look at your yearbooks

649
00:28:16,266 --> 00:28:17,734
and make fun of your haircuts.

650
00:28:17,867 --> 00:28:18,667
You do that already.

651
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:21,066
Oh, and where is your desk?

652
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,867
I just use my
laptop on my bed.

653
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:24,834
Oh.

654
00:28:26,934 --> 00:28:26,967
I always wanted a desk so bad,

655
00:28:33,333 --> 00:28:36,000
because we were always at
the Dragon after school.

656
00:28:36,133 --> 00:28:37,867
So they gave us the table
to do our homework at,

657
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,834
and not the good corner table,

658
00:28:39,967 --> 00:28:42,066
but the bad one near
the men's bathroom.

659
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,133
I'm sorry, babe.

660
00:28:44,266 --> 00:28:47,200
It's where I did my homework
every day after school.

661
00:28:47,333 --> 00:28:49,100
It's where I studied
for the SATs.

662
00:28:49,233 --> 00:28:52,633
It's where I found out I
got into NYU (chuckles).

663
00:28:53,934 --> 00:28:56,600
It's where my first
boyfriend broke up with me.

664
00:28:56,734 --> 00:28:58,200
Sounds like The
Golden Dragon means more

665
00:28:58,333 --> 00:29:00,533
to you than you'd like to admit.

666
00:29:00,667 --> 00:29:03,934
(melancholy music)

667
00:29:04,066 --> 00:29:07,066
You are not going to
get me that easy, Blake.

668
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,667
No tears this holiday.

669
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:13,266
I am a ball of light and
love and holiday cheer.

670
00:29:15,734 --> 00:29:15,767
[Blake] Come here.

671
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,133
[All] Yeah!

672
00:29:22,266 --> 00:29:23,266
Yes!
(Tinsley laughing)

673
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,734
That's what I'm talking about.

674
00:29:24,867 --> 00:29:25,667
Woo!

675
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,066
Let's go!
- Yes.

676
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,934
I think this room needs
some Christmas sparkle.

677
00:29:31,066 --> 00:29:33,800
But babe, there's nothing
more Christmas than football.

678
00:29:33,934 --> 00:29:35,533
Oh, I just thought
it would be fun

679
00:29:35,667 --> 00:29:37,633
if we all built a
gingerbread house together.

680
00:29:37,767 --> 00:29:40,166
But we're already
together watching football.

681
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:42,000
That's a great idea, Romy.

682
00:29:42,133 --> 00:29:45,166
Let's all take a
break from the game.

683
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,133
(bright holiday music)

684
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:57,800
Maybe you didn't
add enough frosting.

685
00:29:57,934 --> 00:30:00,300
I don't know, I've
never built one before.

686
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,200
Oh, oh!

687
00:30:04,333 --> 00:30:07,266
(playful music)

688
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,900
(Romy sighs)

689
00:30:10,033 --> 00:30:11,000
Oh, oh!

690
00:30:11,133 --> 00:30:14,033
(music continues)

691
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,300
Yeah.

692
00:30:18,433 --> 00:30:21,166
My first gingerbread house
was a complete disaster.

693
00:30:22,767 --> 00:30:23,433
It wasn't a disaster, it
was just not up to code.

694
00:30:23,567 --> 00:30:27,700
(phone ringing)

695
00:30:30,066 --> 00:30:31,033
Oh, it's Rick.

696
00:30:31,166 --> 00:30:31,934
- I'm gonna go in.
- Yeah.

697
00:30:32,066 --> 00:30:33,200
(phone beeps)

698
00:30:33,333 --> 00:30:35,266
Hey.
- It is insanity over here.

699
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,800
I've only got a sec, but
I thought you should know,

700
00:30:37,934 --> 00:30:40,800
even though Mom and Dad
don't want me to tell you.

701
00:30:40,934 --> 00:30:43,633
This is sounding
pretty ominous.

702
00:30:43,767 --> 00:30:45,300
Mom and Dad sold
the restaurant.

703
00:30:47,734 --> 00:30:49,734
What?

704
00:30:49,867 --> 00:30:51,166
Yeah, Christmas
Eve is our last night

705
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:52,600
and then we're closed forever.

706
00:30:52,734 --> 00:30:54,734
(tray clattering)
(melancholy music)

707
00:30:54,867 --> 00:30:56,133
Hey, someone just
dropped a whole tray

708
00:30:56,266 --> 00:30:57,133
of steamed pork buns.

709
00:30:57,266 --> 00:30:58,600
I gotta go.
- Oh...

710
00:30:58,734 --> 00:31:01,667
(music continues)

711
00:31:05,467 --> 00:31:06,333
How's Rick?

712
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,567
My parents sold
the restaurant.

713
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,734
What?

714
00:31:13,867 --> 00:31:15,734
Romy, I am so sorry.

715
00:31:15,867 --> 00:31:18,867
Why didn't they tell me
sooner so that I could be there?

716
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:19,967
Are you okay?

717
00:31:21,967 --> 00:31:29,200
(mischievous music)

718
00:31:29,333 --> 00:31:30,066
Romy?

719
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,967
(music continues)

720
00:31:37,867 --> 00:31:39,066
[Romy] I said no tears.

721
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:41,133
Oh no.

722
00:31:41,266 --> 00:31:42,166
No way.

723
00:31:44,266 --> 00:31:51,266
(Blake sighs)

724
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,033
- Hey.
- You finally got it fixed.

725
00:31:53,166 --> 00:31:54,266
Yeah.

726
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,867
Go Mom, finding
your inner handyman.

727
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,166
No (chuckles), it was
actually the delivery driver

728
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:00,867
from The Golden Dragon.

729
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,934
He's such a nice young man.

730
00:32:03,066 --> 00:32:04,467
He was even running
late for an interview

731
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,834
and he still volunteered
to fix it for me.

732
00:32:06,967 --> 00:32:08,800
And then the poor kid
ripped his jacket.

733
00:32:08,934 --> 00:32:10,500
Had to loan him one
of Daddy's suits.

734
00:32:15,467 --> 00:32:18,500
(soft holiday music)

735
00:32:22,367 --> 00:32:25,266
(Veronica sighs)

736
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,734
When are you getting
rid of Dad's old chair?

737
00:32:27,867 --> 00:32:30,066
(sighs) Your Dad
sat in that chair

738
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,333
every night reviewing
his playbook.

739
00:32:32,467 --> 00:32:34,800
Well, you can redecorate now.

740
00:32:34,934 --> 00:32:36,767
Make the house more you.

741
00:32:39,467 --> 00:32:42,066
Maybe take down
some of Dad's stuff.

742
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,767
No, I'm proud of
his accomplishments.

743
00:32:45,867 --> 00:32:48,100
You were a
brilliant architect.

744
00:32:48,233 --> 00:32:51,066
The only woman on track
for partner at your firm.

745
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,734
You coulda kept working,

746
00:32:52,867 --> 00:32:54,967
actually done something
that made you happy.

747
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:59,467
I wanna get your idea on
party decorations, please.

748
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,133
Used to be quite the crafter.

749
00:33:01,266 --> 00:33:03,300
When I had a life
outside of work.

750
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:08,200
I remember staying up all
night with you before the party,

751
00:33:08,333 --> 00:33:11,266
making hundreds of origami
snowflakes, you remember?

752
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,000
You were so relentless.

753
00:33:13,133 --> 00:33:16,300
Had to make sure that every
fold was perfect and precise.

754
00:33:16,433 --> 00:33:18,834
Where do you think I
learned that from, huh?

755
00:33:20,333 --> 00:33:22,467
You should just relax this year.

756
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,767
Maybe even cancel.

757
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:24,867
People will understand.

758
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,133
I'm not canceling!

759
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:33,767
This party has
happened for 30 years.

760
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:36,033
Did you have your
appointment with Dr. Cohen?

761
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:37,533
Yep.

762
00:33:37,667 --> 00:33:38,900
[Jane] And?

763
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,467
And nothing.

764
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,834
It didn't take.

765
00:33:44,934 --> 00:33:46,133
Can you do another
round of IVF?

766
00:33:46,266 --> 00:33:48,300
I've already done four.

767
00:33:48,433 --> 00:33:52,066
The hormones are really messing
with my body and the cost,

768
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,200
well, I'd have to
get another promotion

769
00:33:54,333 --> 00:33:55,200
in order to afford it,

770
00:33:55,333 --> 00:33:56,867
but then I'll be
working too much

771
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,300
to even hang out with my kid.

772
00:33:59,467 --> 00:33:59,500
I know what that's
like, all too well.

773
00:34:03,767 --> 00:34:08,567
I'm sorry, Mom, I'm just...
(Jane sighs)

774
00:34:12,333 --> 00:34:14,000
It's been a hard day.

775
00:34:14,133 --> 00:34:15,300
Yeah, I know.

776
00:34:18,066 --> 00:34:20,266
(bright holiday music)

777
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,934
(Nate sighs)

778
00:34:26,333 --> 00:34:26,367
(Nate chuckles)

779
00:34:34,266 --> 00:34:35,533
Time to write your
note to Santa.

780
00:34:35,667 --> 00:34:36,567
No thanks.

781
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:39,367
We do this every year, Jessa.

782
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:41,500
Do you think Santa
knows about the time

783
00:34:41,633 --> 00:34:44,900
I hid my brussel sprouts
in the bushes outside?

784
00:34:46,133 --> 00:34:47,867
Or should I tell him about that?

785
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,934
I definitely wanna
be on the nice list.

786
00:34:50,066 --> 00:34:51,467
It's not gonna happen.

787
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,133
You're naughty all the way.

788
00:34:53,266 --> 00:34:55,834
Jessa, don't get your
tinsel in a tangle.

789
00:34:55,967 --> 00:34:57,066
Gimme that tablet.

790
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,433
I'm almost at level 33.

791
00:34:59,567 --> 00:35:03,133
Why don't we run your
lines for the pageant, hm?

792
00:35:03,266 --> 00:35:05,200
- Really?
- Absolutely.

793
00:35:05,333 --> 00:35:07,333
You said you were
getting nervous.

794
00:35:07,467 --> 00:35:08,333
Okay.

795
00:35:08,467 --> 00:35:10,000
You said you were
getting nervous.

796
00:35:10,133 --> 00:35:11,934
We're standing up
because we always

797
00:35:12,066 --> 00:35:14,934
must practice as we perform.

798
00:35:15,066 --> 00:35:16,100
- Okay.
- Go for it.

799
00:35:19,033 --> 00:35:19,066
"Let us...

800
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:27,633
Sweetheart?

801
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,400
It's okay.

802
00:35:34,467 --> 00:35:35,934
You don't.

803
00:35:36,066 --> 00:35:36,600
I?

804
00:35:36,734 --> 00:35:37,934
Are you kidding me?

805
00:35:38,066 --> 00:35:39,834
I don't?

806
00:35:39,967 --> 00:35:44,066
You are looking at someone
who once took four semesters

807
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:48,266
of French to get out of one
semester of public speaking.

808
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,266
I couldn't even barely watch
somebody else speak publicly.

809
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,166
Really?

810
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:52,667
Yeah.

811
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,133
Then I got a job at this company

812
00:35:55,266 --> 00:35:58,166
and I had to give a
lot of presentations,

813
00:36:01,066 --> 00:36:05,433
You wanna know my secret?

814
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:11,467
Hey Romy, if you ever
wondered how much I love you,

815
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:12,700
this is proof.

816
00:36:14,467 --> 00:36:15,734
I feel ridiculous.

817
00:36:15,867 --> 00:36:17,533
You feel ridiculous?

818
00:36:17,667 --> 00:36:18,533
So, how does this work?

819
00:36:18,667 --> 00:36:20,367
Do I just go knock on the door?

820
00:36:21,633 --> 00:36:23,333
I don't know.

821
00:36:23,467 --> 00:36:27,600
- I guess.
- We've never done it before.

822
00:36:27,734 --> 00:36:29,567
Okay, I'll go do it.

823
00:36:30,467 --> 00:36:31,333
All right.

824
00:36:31,467 --> 00:36:34,166
(playful music)

825
00:36:36,133 --> 00:36:36,166
(baby cries)

826
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:41,533
We're here to sing carols.

827
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,367
Why?

828
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:46,266
To spread holiday cheer.

829
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,767
Nope.

830
00:36:50,133 --> 00:36:53,600
♪ Good tidings we bring
to you and your kin ♪

831
00:36:53,734 --> 00:36:58,266

(Romy sighs)

838
00:37:22,467 --> 00:37:25,133
Sorry the caroling
was such a disaster.

839
00:37:25,266 --> 00:37:30,233
I mean, I knew it would
be, but I'm still sorry.

840
00:37:32,467 --> 00:37:35,266
What's the point of living
in this winter wonderland

841
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,700
if you're not swept up
in Christmas spirit?

842
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:40,800
Could this angst
have something

843
00:37:40,934 --> 00:37:42,700
to do with The Golden
Dragon closing?

844
00:37:44,333 --> 00:37:44,367
Of course not.

845
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:53,967
(bright holiday music)

846
00:37:56,667 --> 00:37:57,500
Thank you.

847
00:38:01,033 --> 00:38:03,266
I forget how beautiful
it can be here.

848
00:38:04,433 --> 00:38:06,867
You can always move
back after graduation.

849
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,367
I already have a job lined up.

850
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:10,867
Huh, really?

851
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,600
Yeah, I interned
with this really

852
00:38:12,734 --> 00:38:14,867
great political action
coalition over the summer,

853
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,967
so I'm going to start
as a coordinator,

854
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:19,500
get some experience
in a nonprofit space,

855
00:38:19,633 --> 00:38:22,367
and then go to law school
and clerk for a judge

856
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:23,667
and then run for office.

857
00:38:25,867 --> 00:38:28,500
Well, sounds like you've
got everything figured out.

858
00:38:28,633 --> 00:38:30,567
I guess college just
caught up to me.

859
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:32,867
Soon I'll be
homeless and jobless.

860
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,967
Really nailing that life thing.

861
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:36,967
Maybe it's for the best.

862
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:38,900
I know, my parents
have worked hard.

863
00:38:39,033 --> 00:38:40,734
They deserve a break.

864
00:38:40,867 --> 00:38:43,934
Well, sure, but I meant
for the best for you.

865
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,300
Yeah?

866
00:38:48,433 --> 00:38:50,300
I mean, you don't have
the best track record

867
00:38:50,433 --> 00:38:52,200
for taking charge
of your future.

868
00:38:52,333 --> 00:38:53,367
I can take charge.

869
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:56,900
(Rick laughs)
(Sadie laughs)

870
00:38:57,033 --> 00:38:58,967
There's actually
something I've been dying

871
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:01,533
to do since I got back home.

872
00:39:01,667 --> 00:39:02,767
If you're game?

873
00:39:06,767 --> 00:39:09,633
You know, you are
gonna have to let go

874
00:39:09,767 --> 00:39:12,667
of those presents at some point.

875
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,400
I'm fine just watching.

876
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,033
You know, my cousin told me

877
00:39:17,166 --> 00:39:19,367
that you missed all of
your classes sophomore year

878
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:20,900
and that's why you flunked out.

879
00:39:22,633 --> 00:39:22,667
I had everything
in high school,

880
00:39:28,767 --> 00:39:33,367
Better schools, better jobs.

881
00:39:35,667 --> 00:39:36,767
If you're not
happy with your life,

882
00:39:40,533 --> 00:39:44,367
Change what you can
and work on the rest.

883
00:39:46,066 --> 00:39:51,900
Take action.

884
00:39:52,033 --> 00:39:52,867
Oh, oh (laughs)!

885
00:39:54,633 --> 00:40:04,600
(bright holiday music)

886
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:06,967
When you promised
me a midnight snack,

887
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:09,834
this isn't quite
what I was thinking.

888
00:40:09,967 --> 00:40:11,767
I need to
decompress after that.

889
00:40:13,567 --> 00:40:14,000
And cooking is my meditation.

890
00:40:19,433 --> 00:40:24,500
So there's this kid's
Christmas event happening

891
00:40:27,033 --> 00:40:27,867
at the church tomorrow,

892
00:40:30,834 --> 00:40:34,300
Kids in foster care will
create this wish registry

893
00:40:34,433 --> 00:40:36,633
like a bridal or
a baby shower one,

894
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:39,633
and people will buy
the gifts anonymously

895
00:40:39,767 --> 00:40:42,033
and then we wrap
them and have Santa

896
00:40:42,166 --> 00:40:43,900
and his elves pass them out.

897
00:40:45,033 --> 00:40:46,367
Sounds really nice.

898
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:48,700
Well, my cousin was
supposed to go with me,

899
00:40:48,834 --> 00:40:50,633
but she's got the flu.

900
00:40:50,767 --> 00:40:54,600
So, do you wanna be my plus one?

901
00:40:56,033 --> 00:40:57,500
You'd have to dress up as a elf,

902
00:40:57,633 --> 00:40:59,734
but I promise you the tights
are super comfortable.

903
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:02,700
Sounds like fun.

904
00:41:02,834 --> 00:41:04,700
Minus the tights part.

905
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:06,133
Really?

906
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:10,433
I'd love to spend as much time

907
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,700
with you as I can
while you're home.

908
00:41:13,834 --> 00:41:16,934
(light holiday music)

909
00:41:23,767 --> 00:41:25,000
Nice job.

910
00:41:25,133 --> 00:41:27,367
I see you're makin' progress.

911
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:30,834
Jack, I don't know how you
talk me into these things.

912
00:41:30,967 --> 00:41:33,133
Well, you know, I usually
have my pal help me.

913
00:41:34,834 --> 00:41:35,767
Pal, huh?

914
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:36,967
[Jack] Mm hm.

915
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:38,633
Is there a lady friend
I should know about?

916
00:41:38,767 --> 00:41:40,433
It would take a
very special lady

917
00:41:40,567 --> 00:41:42,500
to live up to my Margaret,

918
00:41:42,633 --> 00:41:44,867
and I haven't met one yet
and I probably never will.

919
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,834
So, is this helper your
secret Santa gift or something?

920
00:41:47,967 --> 00:41:49,433
It's Miguel.

921
00:41:49,567 --> 00:41:50,367
Miguel?

922
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:51,600
From The Golden Dragon.

923
00:41:52,967 --> 00:41:54,700
- He shovels your snow?
- Yes.

924
00:41:54,834 --> 00:41:58,633
He cuts my grass, cleans my
ceiling fans, bears my gutters.

925
00:41:58,767 --> 00:42:00,633
(chuckles) Oh, you
know, actually,

926
00:42:00,767 --> 00:42:03,967
I gotta ask him about fixing
the screen on my back door.

927
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:07,934
Maybe power wash the back patio,
dust off the top cabinets.

928
00:42:08,066 --> 00:42:09,400
Saw someone used
the grill last night

929
00:42:09,533 --> 00:42:10,767
and didn't clean it again.

930
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:11,700
Sorry, dude.

931
00:42:11,834 --> 00:42:13,533
I had Sadie over last night

932
00:42:13,667 --> 00:42:15,667
and I totally
forgot to clean up.

933
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:18,066
Sadie? Nice, man.

934
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:19,767
When are you gonna
see her again?

935
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,633
Tonight.

936
00:42:22,767 --> 00:42:24,700
I'm helping her hand out
gifts at this toy drive.

937
00:42:24,834 --> 00:42:25,567
Tonight?

938
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:26,500
Are you crazy?

939
00:42:26,633 --> 00:42:27,433
Your dad is gonna kill you.

940
00:42:27,567 --> 00:42:28,367
Oh, no, no, no.

941
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:29,600
Your dad is gonna kill you.

942
00:42:29,734 --> 00:42:31,500
I already already double
or large table reservations, es

943
00:42:31,633 --> 00:42:33,166
so should be able to sneak out

944
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:35,533
for a couple hours
without anyone noticing.

945
00:42:39,166 --> 00:42:41,100
You know, maybe it
wouldn't be the worst thing

946
00:42:41,233 --> 00:42:44,433
your dad saw the mess,
found out that you cook.

947
00:42:44,567 --> 00:42:45,667
Just like it wouldn't
be the worst thing

948
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,066
if your dad found out
you've been hiding

949
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,867
your college acceptance letters?

950
00:42:50,166 --> 00:42:51,066
(bright holiday music)

951
00:42:58,033 --> 00:42:58,967
- Veronica.
- Hey.

952
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:00,133
Hey, how are ya?

953
00:43:00,266 --> 00:43:01,767
Good.

954
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:03,500
I don't think I've ever
seen you dress so casually.

955
00:43:03,633 --> 00:43:04,633
You're always in a power suit.

956
00:43:04,767 --> 00:43:06,000
(Veronica laughs)

957
00:43:06,133 --> 00:43:08,033
What are you doin' here, Nate?

958
00:43:08,166 --> 00:43:10,133
Well, I was just
dropping off the girls

959
00:43:10,266 --> 00:43:12,867
at pageant practice and I
thought I'd surprise them

960
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,767
with their mom's famous
roast chicken, but-

961
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:17,600
I'm guessing that
didn't go so well?

962
00:43:17,734 --> 00:43:19,767
No, no it didn't at all.

963
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:21,166
Let's just say
that a smoke alarm

964
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:23,567
may have been sacrificed
in the mayhem.

965
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:25,100
(Nate chuckles)
(Veronica chuckles)

966
00:43:25,233 --> 00:43:26,900
So.

967
00:43:27,033 --> 00:43:29,500
Don't try too hard
to be the fun parent.

968
00:43:29,633 --> 00:43:31,934
Sometimes just being
there to listen is enough.

969
00:43:33,633 --> 00:43:34,767
Wise words.

970
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:35,867
I know.

971
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:36,767
[Server] Here you go.

972
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:38,100
- Oh, thank you.
- Thanks.

973
00:43:41,166 --> 00:43:43,767
Actually, you know, I
don't have to pick them up

974
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:45,834
for at least another hour.

975
00:43:45,967 --> 00:43:47,734
Is there anywhere
you needed to be?

976
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:51,500
Are Jessa and Vivi
excited about the pageant?

977
00:43:51,633 --> 00:43:53,900
Oh, Vivi's a total ham.

978
00:43:54,033 --> 00:43:56,233
She cannot wait to be
the center of attention

979
00:43:56,367 --> 00:43:58,033
and be right up on that stage.

980
00:43:58,166 --> 00:44:00,100
Jessa on the other hand,

981
00:44:00,233 --> 00:44:02,667
she suffers from
terrible stage fright.

982
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,967
So, any production she's ever
been a part of growing up

983
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:07,033
has always ended up
in complete disaster.

984
00:44:07,166 --> 00:44:09,033
(chuckles) Yikes.

985
00:44:09,166 --> 00:44:13,967
Speaking of which, what
are you doing tomorrow night?

986
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:15,934
There's an extra special
pageant happening

987
00:44:16,066 --> 00:44:17,200
that you may know about.

988
00:44:18,367 --> 00:44:19,967
The girls would be
psyched to see you.

989
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:22,066
You wanna come?

990
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:26,700
Oh Nate, I would love to,
but tomorrow's my mom's party.

991
00:44:26,834 --> 00:44:29,700
I'm not really looking
forward to socializing

992
00:44:29,834 --> 00:44:31,934
with a hundred of her
and my dad's friends,

993
00:44:33,066 --> 00:44:35,066
but I need to be there for her.

994
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:36,033
And for you.

995
00:44:40,367 --> 00:44:45,333
(dishes clattering)
(food sizzling)

996
00:44:46,166 --> 00:44:46,900
Oh, there you are.

997
00:44:47,033 --> 00:44:48,033
Are you going someplace?

998
00:44:48,166 --> 00:44:49,166
Just a quick errand.

999
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:50,567
I'll be back before
the dinner rush.

1000
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:51,700
No, no, no, I need
you in the kitchen.

1001
00:44:51,834 --> 00:44:52,834
Just 30 minutes.

1002
00:44:52,967 --> 00:44:53,800
I have to tell
Sadie that I can't-

1003
00:44:53,934 --> 00:44:56,633
Just 30 minutes.

1004
00:44:58,767 --> 00:44:58,800
Let me text her.

1005
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:04,967
I'll promise you, you'll
get a break later, okay?

1006
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:07,800
(solemn music)

1007
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:19,734
[Rick] Hey, it's Rick.

1008
00:45:19,867 --> 00:45:20,900
I probably won't listen to this.

1009
00:45:21,033 --> 00:45:23,867
(music continues)

1010
00:45:39,433 --> 00:45:41,233
(door slams)

1011
00:45:41,367 --> 00:45:44,166
Hey man, everything okay?

1012
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:47,166
(sighs) She won't
return my calls.

1013
00:45:48,567 --> 00:45:49,934
I was supposed to meet her
at the church last night,

1014
00:45:50,066 --> 00:45:51,467
but I was stuck helping my dad.

1015
00:45:52,834 --> 00:46:01,166
I've blown my chance
with her, again.

1016
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:03,867
[Tinsley] Okay,
time to open presents.

1017
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
Oh, aren't we supposed
to open presents

1018
00:46:06,133 --> 00:46:10,433
on Christmas morning, not
10 a.m. on Christmas Eve?

1019
00:46:10,567 --> 00:46:13,233
The kids were always so
impatient with their presents

1020
00:46:13,367 --> 00:46:15,133
that they couldn't wait
till Christmas morning.

1021
00:46:15,266 --> 00:46:16,367
So, one year we decided

1022
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:18,767
to let them open
presents a day early.

1023
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:21,433
(chuckles) But then the
tradition just stuck.

1024
00:46:21,567 --> 00:46:24,033
Besides, we like to spend
our Christmas Eve night

1025
00:46:24,166 --> 00:46:25,166
at our favorite restaurant.

1026
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:26,500
We've been going
there for years.

1027
00:46:26,633 --> 00:46:29,834
- The Swan House.
- Oh, sounds very elegant.

1028
00:46:30,967 --> 00:46:32,834
Oh, thank you.

1029
00:46:32,967 --> 00:46:37,934
(wrapping tearing)
(bright holiday music)

1030
00:46:39,233 --> 00:46:39,266
Oh, it's beautiful.

1031
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:47,133
- Thank you.
- You're welcome, kiddo.

1032
00:46:48,266 --> 00:46:51,100
All right, all right,
time for my gift.

1033
00:46:51,233 --> 00:46:54,500
Oh, saving the best for last.

1034
00:46:54,633 --> 00:46:56,767
I can't wait to
see what's inside.

1035
00:46:56,900 --> 00:46:59,800
(music continues)

1036
00:47:08,233 --> 00:47:09,467
Do you like it?

1037
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:11,400
Blake,

1038
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:19,600
(music continues)

1039
00:47:21,967 --> 00:47:23,567
(Veronica exhales)

1040
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:26,600
(melancholy music)

1041
00:47:32,567 --> 00:47:33,834
(Jane sighs)

1042
00:47:33,967 --> 00:47:39,333
(Veronica knocks)
(music continues)

1043
00:47:39,467 --> 00:47:39,500
Mom, where are you?

1044
00:47:40,367 --> 00:47:43,767
(Veronica knocks)
(music continues)

1045
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:48,300
What happened to the party?

1046
00:47:51,367 --> 00:47:53,567
(sighs) Couldn't do it.

1047
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:54,533
Not alone.

1048
00:47:56,433 --> 00:48:00,300
I emailed out a
cancellation to everyone.

1049
00:48:00,433 --> 00:48:01,967
Except me?
(Jane chuckles)

1050
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:03,233
We both not
would've been buried

1051
00:48:03,367 --> 00:48:05,600
in your inbox until
St. Patrick's Day.

1052
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:06,734
I'll give you that one.

1053
00:48:11,533 --> 00:48:13,433
It's okay, it's just a party.

1054
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:16,066
It's not just a
party, it is my life.

1055
00:48:17,233 --> 00:48:18,166
I can't do this alone.

1056
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:26,533
but we both know the truth.

1057
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:32,300
Players needed him.

1058
00:48:32,433 --> 00:48:33,967
We needed him, too.

1059
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:36,500
Your father was very
important to this community,

1060
00:48:37,567 --> 00:48:37,600
and I had to be supportive.

1061
00:48:42,233 --> 00:48:44,367
before you gave it
all up to become

1062
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:46,033
some Division One coach's wife?

1063
00:48:46,166 --> 00:48:47,300
Veronica, raising a family

1064
00:48:47,433 --> 00:48:49,233
was the greatest joy in my life.

1065
00:48:49,367 --> 00:48:51,100
And your father was not perfect,

1066
00:48:51,233 --> 00:48:53,300
but he was my
partner for 30 years

1067
00:48:53,433 --> 00:48:57,467
and I can't just erase
all traces of him
the moment he dies.

1068
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:01,700
Why don't we do something?

1069
00:49:01,834 --> 00:49:03,100
Go out?

1070
00:49:03,233 --> 00:49:04,133
I just...

1071
00:49:06,233 --> 00:49:09,567
I'd just like to be
alone tonight, please.

1072
00:49:17,433 --> 00:49:18,500
(Jane sighs)

1073
00:49:18,633 --> 00:49:21,567
(melancholy music)

1074
00:49:22,767 --> 00:49:24,166
Oh.

1075
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:27,500
Do I want you or microwave
popcorn for dinner?

1076
00:49:27,633 --> 00:49:30,200
(Jack knocks)

1077
00:49:32,333 --> 00:49:32,367
Mom, I knew...

1078
00:49:34,667 --> 00:49:37,033
Do you need something?

1079
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:39,967
I saw your lights were on.

1080
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:42,633
How come you're not at your
mother's fancy shindig?

1081
00:49:42,767 --> 00:49:43,967
She canceled.

1082
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:49,066
Oh, missin' your dad?

1083
00:49:52,834 --> 00:49:54,066
but my niece hid everything.

1084
00:49:56,834 --> 00:49:59,300
Oh, don't Scrooge out on me.

1085
00:49:59,433 --> 00:50:01,000
It's Christmas.

1086
00:50:03,567 --> 00:50:07,700
(laughs) You did not tell
your physical therapist that.

1087
00:50:07,834 --> 00:50:09,100
I did.

1088
00:50:09,233 --> 00:50:11,233
The little dictator
deserved it, too.

1089
00:50:11,367 --> 00:50:13,233
(Veronica laughs)

1090
00:50:13,367 --> 00:50:17,233
Wow, somebody's getting
cozy with Mr. Claus.

1091
00:50:17,367 --> 00:50:19,500
I bought them all last
month in a fit of excitement

1092
00:50:19,633 --> 00:50:21,400
when I thought I might be...

1093
00:50:22,767 --> 00:50:22,800
Might be?

1094
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:29,100
Oh.

1095
00:50:29,233 --> 00:50:30,500
But I'm not.

1096
00:50:30,633 --> 00:50:33,200
I just, I couldn't bear to
send them back just yet.

1097
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:39,233
You know, Margaret and I
couldn't have children either.

1098
00:50:39,367 --> 00:50:41,967
I didn't know that, I
thought it was by choice.

1099
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:45,633
Oh, we both come
from big families,

1100
00:50:45,767 --> 00:50:48,533
but wasn't in the cards.

1101
00:50:50,233 --> 00:50:51,300
How did you deal with it?

1102
00:50:51,433 --> 00:50:53,967
The disappointment?

1103
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:56,166
14 nieces and nephews.

1104
00:50:56,300 --> 00:50:57,233
14?

1105
00:50:57,367 --> 00:50:59,633
(exhales) That's crazy.

1106
00:50:59,767 --> 00:51:01,700
And we had time to volunteer,

1107
00:51:01,834 --> 00:51:03,400
be parental figures
to those kids

1108
00:51:03,533 --> 00:51:05,533
who might not have anyone else.

1109
00:51:05,667 --> 00:51:06,600
Still.

1110
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:11,166
Choosing to make
meaning out of a loss

1111
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:13,734
is both empowering and healing.

1112
00:51:15,433 --> 00:51:16,767
Make this unexpected,

1113
00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:21,066
unplanned life meaningful
and fulfilling anyways.

1114
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:33,467
(bright holiday music)

1115
00:51:33,834 --> 00:51:36,767
(music continues)

1116
00:51:39,767 --> 00:51:41,367
Scooch over.

1117
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:42,467
- Hey.
- Hi.

1118
00:51:45,433 --> 00:51:47,367
I figured this was more
exciting than passing out

1119
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:50,500
in a bag of eggnog ice cream
to some holiday movie marathon.

1120
00:51:50,633 --> 00:51:52,300
(Nate chuckles)
(Veronica chuckles)

1121
00:51:52,433 --> 00:51:53,667
Yeah.

1122
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:55,467
You're just in time.

1123
00:51:57,900 --> 00:51:59,400
You got this, Jessa.

1124
00:51:59,533 --> 00:52:02,667
(anticipatory music)

1125
00:52:06,233 --> 00:52:08,567
(playful music)

1126
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:09,467
Oh no.

1127
00:52:11,333 --> 00:52:17,433
Excuse me a second.

1128
00:52:17,567 --> 00:52:19,166
Sweetheart, Jessa?

1129
00:52:19,300 --> 00:52:20,700
Dad, what are you doing?

1130
00:52:20,834 --> 00:52:22,500
Remember what I taught you?

1131
00:52:22,633 --> 00:52:25,667
(anticipatory music)

1132
00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:37,633
(music continues)

1133
00:52:37,767 --> 00:52:40,500
"Let us now go unto Bethlehem

1134
00:52:40,633 --> 00:52:42,633
to see this thing
which has come to pass,

1135
00:52:42,767 --> 00:52:45,300
which the Lord have
made known unto to us.

1136
00:52:45,433 --> 00:52:47,367
Make haste in this
glorious night."

1137
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:50,734
(gentle holiday music)

1138
00:53:00,834 --> 00:53:03,700
Yes, just right there
in the center banquet.

1139
00:53:03,834 --> 00:53:05,433
Enjoy your meal.

1140
00:53:05,567 --> 00:53:06,934
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1141
00:53:09,767 --> 00:53:10,700
(Sadie chuckles)

1142
00:53:10,834 --> 00:53:13,533
(gentle music)

1143
00:53:16,934 --> 00:53:19,700
All right, here's
the credit card slips.

1144
00:53:19,834 --> 00:53:20,700
I've gotta head off to church.

1145
00:53:20,834 --> 00:53:21,900
Okay.

1146
00:53:22,033 --> 00:53:23,400
Oh, what happened
with the interview?

1147
00:53:23,533 --> 00:53:25,233
You never told me how it went.

1148
00:53:25,367 --> 00:53:26,633
Total bust.

1149
00:53:26,767 --> 00:53:28,400
Maybe it's just not meant to be.

1150
00:53:32,367 --> 00:53:34,166
Hey, Sadie, I just
want to explain why-

1151
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:35,400
Save it.

1152
00:53:35,533 --> 00:53:38,800
Hey, Sadie, I just
want to explain why-

1153
00:53:38,934 --> 00:53:41,400
And I'm the dumb one
who cares about you.

1154
00:53:42,633 --> 00:53:42,667
I've cared about you for years

1155
00:53:46,667 --> 00:53:49,633
because I'm 3,000 miles
away and it's easy.

1156
00:53:49,767 --> 00:53:51,767
You don't do hard, ever.

1157
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:55,266
(bright holiday music)

1158
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:02,700
(attendees chattering)

1159
00:54:08,433 --> 00:54:10,333
- Oh, hey, Jessa.
- Not now, Dad.

1160
00:54:13,734 --> 00:54:13,767
(Nate sighs)

1161
00:54:18,734 --> 00:54:20,400
Hey, Jessa, please.

1162
00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:22,834
What's wrong?

1163
00:54:22,967 --> 00:54:24,900
Could you be
more embarrassing?

1164
00:54:25,033 --> 00:54:25,834
What?

1165
00:54:25,967 --> 00:54:27,000
I thought it was helping.

1166
00:54:29,467 --> 00:54:29,500
(Nate sighs)

1167
00:54:35,433 --> 00:54:37,333
I can't seem to
do anything right.

1168
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:40,900
Sometimes I feel like I'm
just not cut out for this.

1169
00:54:41,033 --> 00:54:42,834
Nate.
(Luis speaking in Spanish)

1170
00:54:42,967 --> 00:54:43,700
Miguel.

1171
00:54:43,834 --> 00:54:45,500
We're late already.

1172
00:54:45,633 --> 00:54:47,867
Ms. Roberts, good
to see you again.

1173
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:48,967
Merry Christmas.

1174
00:54:49,100 --> 00:54:50,433
You too, Miguel.

1175
00:54:50,567 --> 00:54:52,300
Merry Christmas.

1176
00:54:52,433 --> 00:54:53,600
You must be Luis.

1177
00:54:54,567 --> 00:54:55,900
I'm Nate.

1178
00:54:56,033 --> 00:54:57,600
Pleasure to finally meet you.

1179
00:54:57,734 --> 00:54:58,567
Hello, Nate.

1180
00:55:00,433 --> 00:55:01,767
How do you know my son?

1181
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:03,900
One too many orders of
sesame chicken (chuckles).

1182
00:55:04,033 --> 00:55:05,667
(chuckles) I see.

1183
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:06,934
The Chens have been
wonderful to Miguel.

1184
00:55:14,433 --> 00:55:15,700
where he can flourish.

1185
00:55:15,834 --> 00:55:16,900
Okay, Papa, let's
go get a seat.

1186
00:55:17,033 --> 00:55:18,900
Luis, you should
be incredibly proud

1187
00:55:19,033 --> 00:55:20,700
of the man you raised.

1188
00:55:20,834 --> 00:55:23,400
He goes above and
beyond every single day.

1189
00:55:23,533 --> 00:55:25,767
Even looked after my kids once
when I was late coming home

1190
00:55:25,900 --> 00:55:26,967
from the airport
at the restaurant.

1191
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:28,266
You remember that, Miguel?
- Yeah.

1192
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:29,667
Thank you.

1193
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:31,033
I still lawyer you for that.

1194
00:55:31,166 --> 00:55:32,033
Anytime.

1195
00:55:32,166 --> 00:55:35,700
I still lawyer you for that.

1196
00:55:35,834 --> 00:55:36,734
Yeah, sure.

1197
00:55:40,567 --> 00:55:42,367
So, you may not
have a resume full

1198
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:46,934
of sports and debate team
and co-op internships,

1199
00:55:47,066 --> 00:55:50,900
but that doesn't mean you don't
care about your community.

1200
00:55:51,033 --> 00:55:53,367
You've helped my
mom, Mr. Barber.

1201
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:54,300
(Veronica chuckles)
(Miguel chuckles)

1202
00:55:54,433 --> 00:55:56,500
Surely countless other people.

1203
00:55:57,967 --> 00:55:59,633
I may have made
the wrong judgment

1204
00:55:59,767 --> 00:56:01,567
about you on our
first interview.

1205
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:03,433
First? Does does that mean-

1206
00:56:03,567 --> 00:56:05,834
This means you get
another interview.

1207
00:56:05,967 --> 00:56:08,900
A do over, But you better
not be late this time.

1208
00:56:09,033 --> 00:56:10,033
Okay, I promise.

1209
00:56:10,166 --> 00:56:11,000
Okay.

1210
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:17,433
[Romy] I was expecting
holiday ham, not Peking duck.

1211
00:56:17,567 --> 00:56:19,767
[Blake] We always eat
Chinese food on Christmas Eve.

1212
00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:20,633
Evening folks.

1213
00:56:20,767 --> 00:56:21,867
Have we decided?

1214
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,333
Evening folks.

1215
00:56:24,467 --> 00:56:26,700
So let's do the orange chicken,

1216
00:56:26,834 --> 00:56:29,834
the crab rangoon, pot stickers,

1217
00:56:29,967 --> 00:56:31,867
chopped suey, egg foo young,

1218
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,500
oh, and the Mongolian beef.

1219
00:56:34,633 --> 00:56:35,600
Great choices.

1220
00:56:57,700 --> 00:56:59,367
Romy, Blake told us all about

1221
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:00,834
your family's
restaurant closing.

1222
00:57:00,967 --> 00:57:03,266
I know that must be hard.

1223
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:05,934
Now, Jade Palace may not
live up to The Golden Dragon,

1224
00:57:06,066 --> 00:57:07,500
but we wanted to
share it with you.

1225
00:57:07,633 --> 00:57:09,900
What was your family
restaurant like growing up?

1226
00:57:10,033 --> 00:57:11,800
Is Christmas as
crazy as it is here?

1227
00:57:11,934 --> 00:57:13,033
Oh, definitely (chuckles).

1228
00:57:13,166 --> 00:57:14,934
There were so many people,

1229
00:57:15,066 --> 00:57:18,500
nurses and doctors,
international students,

1230
00:57:18,633 --> 00:57:20,900
people who couldn't afford
to fly home for the holidays.

1231
00:57:21,033 --> 00:57:22,100
And because of the Dragon,

1232
00:57:22,233 --> 00:57:24,900
they had some place
to spend Christmas

1233
00:57:25,033 --> 00:57:27,433
along with all the other
holiday orphans in town.

1234
00:57:27,567 --> 00:57:31,967
We made a family, and
made new traditions.

1235
00:57:32,100 --> 00:57:34,567
[Tinsley] That
sounds lovely, Romy.

1236
00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:36,967
Yeah, actually it was.

1237
00:57:37,100 --> 00:57:39,800
(gentle music)

1238
00:57:42,166 --> 00:57:45,967
This Nate, he sure
thinks highly of you.

1239
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:48,033
Yeah, he's a great guy, so.

1240
00:57:48,166 --> 00:57:49,567
Mm hm.

1241
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:51,000
And the woman he was with,

1242
00:57:52,834 --> 00:57:55,433
what did you two sneak
off to talk about?

1243
00:57:55,567 --> 00:57:56,500
She's the administrator

1244
00:57:56,633 --> 00:57:58,066
of the scholarship I applied to.

1245
00:57:59,667 --> 00:58:06,166
I actually think I might have
a chance of getting it, so.

1246
00:58:06,300 --> 00:58:07,033
Papa?

1247
00:58:07,166 --> 00:58:10,533
(gentle holiday music)

1248
00:58:22,700 --> 00:58:24,567
How long have you had these?

1249
00:58:24,700 --> 00:58:29,667
A few weeks.

1250
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:34,900
(Miguel speaking in Spanish)

1251
00:58:35,033 --> 00:58:36,567
(Luis speaking in Spanish)

1252
00:58:36,700 --> 00:58:38,233
It's a terrible feeling

1253
00:58:38,367 --> 00:58:43,033
to see a child's dreams sleep
away because I'm a failure.

1254
00:58:43,166 --> 00:58:44,233
Are you serious?

1255
00:58:44,367 --> 00:58:45,567
You're not a failure.

1256
00:58:46,767 --> 00:58:48,233
You're the kind of
man I want to be,

1257
00:58:48,367 --> 00:58:51,567
the kind of man who sacrifices
everything for his family.

1258
00:58:51,700 --> 00:58:54,867
Yeah, sometimes it's
better to be selfish.

1259
00:58:58,033 --> 00:58:59,200
Now are we going to
look at these at schools

1260
00:59:02,166 --> 00:59:03,667
and burning our marshmallows?

1261
00:59:06,667 --> 00:59:11,633
Wow.

1262
00:59:11,767 --> 00:59:12,967
Oh, excuse me.

1263
00:59:13,100 --> 00:59:15,100
The paramedic that's
waiting for her food,

1264
00:59:15,233 --> 00:59:18,233
would you please put
her order on our bill,

1265
00:59:18,367 --> 00:59:21,667
and tell her that it's a thank
you from her secret Santa.

1266
00:59:23,834 --> 00:59:26,233
Wow, that's very nice.

1267
00:59:26,367 --> 00:59:27,633
Not everyone gets to be near

1268
00:59:27,767 --> 00:59:29,734
their loved ones
during the holidays.

1269
00:59:30,767 --> 00:59:37,967
(gentle music)

1270
00:59:38,100 --> 00:59:43,066
You all are amazing and I'm
so sorry, but I have to go.

1271
00:59:47,100 --> 00:59:47,934
Home.

1272
00:59:49,367 --> 00:59:50,100
To Kansas.

1273
00:59:50,233 --> 00:59:53,133
(music continues)

1274
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:57,100
I'll book your flight.

1275
00:59:57,233 --> 00:59:58,967
I'll drive you to the airport.

1276
00:59:59,100 --> 01:00:00,100
I'll make snacks for the road.

1277
01:00:00,233 --> 01:00:01,667
I'll help you pack.

1278
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:03,667
I'll lend you my new
noise canceling headphones

1279
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:04,600
for the plane.

1280
01:00:07,033 --> 01:00:08,200
And I'll go with you.

1281
01:00:08,333 --> 01:00:09,667
Really?

1282
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:10,834
[All] Yes!

1283
01:00:10,967 --> 01:00:15,633
(all laughing)
(emotional music)

1284
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:25,667
enjoying Christmas morning.

1285
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:28,934
(bright holiday music)

1286
01:00:34,066 --> 01:00:36,934
(music continues)

1287
01:00:41,233 --> 01:00:41,967
(phone chimes)

1288
01:00:42,100 --> 01:00:45,033
(melancholy music)

1289
01:00:52,100 --> 01:00:53,734
Rick, right here.

1290
01:00:54,967 --> 01:00:56,100
Romy, what are you doing?

1291
01:00:56,233 --> 01:00:58,767
Shh, I don't want
Mom and Dad to see.

1292
01:00:58,900 --> 01:01:00,633
Why?

1293
01:01:00,767 --> 01:01:02,367
Because we're opening
the restaurant today.

1294
01:01:03,767 --> 01:01:04,867
We're what now?

1295
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:06,767
Mom and Dad don't
realize how important

1296
01:01:06,900 --> 01:01:10,367
the Dragon is to
this town, and to me.

1297
01:01:11,967 --> 01:01:14,233
All those people who depend on
us for their Christmas meals,

1298
01:01:14,367 --> 01:01:18,100
the ones who are alone
or lost or abandoned,

1299
01:01:18,233 --> 01:01:21,834
or just want a nice meal
that they don't have to cook,

1300
01:01:21,967 --> 01:01:23,200
where will they go today?

1301
01:01:24,166 --> 01:01:26,000
Who will feed them?

1302
01:01:26,133 --> 01:01:27,900
We already gave the
staff the day off.

1303
01:01:28,033 --> 01:01:29,700
So we'll find temporary staff.

1304
01:01:34,100 --> 01:01:35,233
I'll be the chef.

1305
01:01:35,367 --> 01:01:36,200
Yes!

1306
01:01:37,367 --> 01:01:38,300
Good.

1307
01:01:40,834 --> 01:01:41,867
You already knew about that?

1308
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,667
I have spies all
over the Dragon.

1309
01:01:44,367 --> 01:01:45,967
Oh.

1310
01:01:46,100 --> 01:01:47,100
You must be Blake.

1311
01:01:47,233 --> 01:01:48,700
Hey, nice to finally
meet you, man.

1312
01:01:48,834 --> 01:01:49,700
You too, Rick.

1313
01:01:49,834 --> 01:01:51,767
Hey, nice to finally
meet you, man.

1314
01:01:51,900 --> 01:01:53,633
Romy's a little
tired of the one dish

1315
01:01:53,767 --> 01:01:55,367
I know how to make and I hear

1316
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:57,967
you have insane cooking skills.

1317
01:01:58,100 --> 01:02:00,200
I'd be totally down for that.

1318
01:02:00,333 --> 01:02:01,800
Let me grab a jacket.
- Go.

1319
01:02:03,166 --> 01:02:04,066
We're gonna do it.

1320
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:05,033
Okay.
(Romy squeals)

1321
01:02:05,166 --> 01:02:07,300
(Blake laughs)

1322
01:02:07,433 --> 01:02:09,233
Can't believe you got me this.

1323
01:02:09,367 --> 01:02:11,800
Yeah, well, you
mentioned it awhile ago.

1324
01:02:11,934 --> 01:02:13,100
Probably totally uncool by now,

1325
01:02:13,233 --> 01:02:16,433
but I think it's pretty awesome.

1326
01:02:16,567 --> 01:02:17,667
You were talking
about how you wanted

1327
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:19,834
to try to make some jewelry, so.

1328
01:02:19,967 --> 01:02:23,233
I didn't think you'd remember,
or that you were listening.

1329
01:02:23,367 --> 01:02:24,934
I'm always listening, kiddo.

1330
01:02:34,166 --> 01:02:38,166
I'm sorry, Dad, for yelling
at you after the pageant

1331
01:02:38,300 --> 01:02:40,934
and just being a
really big brat lately.

1332
01:02:41,066 --> 01:02:43,367
I've just been kinda
sad since Mom left.

1333
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:45,166
Your mom will be home soon.

1334
01:02:45,300 --> 01:02:47,767
I know, but then
we'll live in two houses

1335
01:02:47,900 --> 01:02:49,166
and have two birthdays and have

1336
01:02:49,300 --> 01:02:50,700
to pick between
you guys for stuff.

1337
01:02:50,834 --> 01:02:52,767
You never have
to pick between us.

1338
01:02:52,900 --> 01:02:54,900
Me and your mom may not
be together anymore,

1339
01:02:55,033 --> 01:02:56,867
but we'll still
always be a family.

1340
01:02:59,300 --> 01:03:01,367
I'll tell you what,

1341
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:04,400
why don't we try to make Mom's
famous cinnamon buns, hm?

1342
01:03:05,300 --> 01:03:06,100
Yeah.

1343
01:03:06,233 --> 01:03:09,400
(gentle holiday music)

1344
01:03:10,633 --> 01:03:10,667
Get your own bowl
of cereal, stealer.

1345
01:03:16,166 --> 01:03:18,900
Where did I put the...

1346
01:03:19,033 --> 01:03:19,867
No. Oh!

1347
01:03:23,166 --> 01:03:23,200
Ah ha.

1348
01:03:28,266 --> 01:03:29,834
make cinnamon rolls
like your mom,

1349
01:03:29,967 --> 01:03:33,367
so I think it's time we
start a new tradition.

1350
01:03:37,033 --> 01:03:38,266
(Vivi laughs)
(bright holiday music)

1351
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:42,367
Oo.

1352
01:03:43,633 --> 01:03:48,333
(girls laughing)

1353
01:03:51,900 --> 01:04:01,567
(music continues)

1354
01:04:01,700 --> 01:04:04,600
(music continues)

1355
01:04:10,166 --> 01:04:14,100
Romy, why aren't
you in Vermont?

1356
01:04:14,233 --> 01:04:16,200
Slight change of plans.

1357
01:04:16,333 --> 01:04:18,300
We're opening up
the Dragon today.

1358
01:04:18,433 --> 01:04:19,467
We need your help.

1359
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:23,200
I'd love to, but
it's Christmas.

1360
01:04:24,367 --> 01:04:26,166
He will be there.

1361
01:04:26,300 --> 01:04:28,900
You're okay with me leaving
the family on Christmas?

1362
01:04:29,033 --> 01:04:32,033
The Chen's have treated
you like a son for years.

1363
01:04:32,166 --> 01:04:34,433
That makes them
part of our family,

1364
01:04:34,567 --> 01:04:36,233
and we don't let family down.

1365
01:04:36,367 --> 01:04:39,567
(bright holiday music)

1366
01:04:44,333 --> 01:04:47,133
(doorbell rings)

1367
01:04:49,433 --> 01:04:50,800
Merry Christmas.

1368
01:04:50,934 --> 01:04:51,967
Mom.

1369
01:04:52,100 --> 01:04:54,066
Hi, what are you doing here?

1370
01:04:57,033 --> 01:04:57,066
I mean, Merry Christmas.

1371
01:05:11,033 --> 01:05:13,533
So, how's your morning been?

1372
01:05:16,367 --> 01:05:19,367
I've definitely lost the
touch over the past few years.

1373
01:05:19,500 --> 01:05:21,967
Oh, honey, you have
so many other talents.

1374
01:05:22,100 --> 01:05:24,467
Don't focus on the one
thing you're not perfect at.

1375
01:05:26,300 --> 01:05:26,333
Thanks, Mom.

1376
01:05:28,734 --> 01:05:32,633
Of course I did.

1377
01:05:38,767 --> 01:05:40,367
I want you to have this.

1378
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:42,166
You didn't have
to do this, Mom.

1379
01:05:42,300 --> 01:05:43,467
Just open it.

1380
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,367
I want you to know who I was

1381
01:05:54,500 --> 01:05:57,066
before I became a wife or a mom.

1382
01:05:58,533 --> 01:05:59,967
You were a partner?

1383
01:06:00,166 --> 01:06:02,500
Well, technically I
didn't accept the promotion.

1384
01:06:02,633 --> 01:06:04,700
I would've had to live
in Copenhagen for a year,

1385
01:06:04,834 --> 01:06:07,200
and that was right when your dad

1386
01:06:07,333 --> 01:06:09,066
was offered the
head coaching job.

1387
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:14,867
(Jane chuckles)
(melancholy music)

1388
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:19,367
I didn't call him back.

1389
01:06:22,166 --> 01:06:24,066
[Jane] Call who back?

1390
01:06:25,300 --> 01:06:27,967
Dad.

1391
01:06:28,100 --> 01:06:29,367
Two days before
his heart attack,

1392
01:06:29,500 --> 01:06:32,367
he dropped off a brochure,
some cruise in Europe.

1393
01:06:32,500 --> 01:06:35,033
I was focused on a
project and I figured

1394
01:06:35,166 --> 01:06:36,667
it was just the
same old routine,

1395
01:06:37,834 --> 01:06:40,033
making promises he
would never keep.

1396
01:06:40,166 --> 01:06:41,200
No.

1397
01:06:41,333 --> 01:06:43,734
He wanted me to
finally see Copenhagen,

1398
01:06:45,333 --> 01:06:49,233
and Paris and Prague
and all those places

1399
01:06:49,367 --> 01:06:51,066
that I always
dreamed of visiting.

1400
01:06:53,734 --> 01:06:53,767
He felt guilty, but
he didn't need to.

1401
01:06:59,367 --> 01:07:03,834
I knew what I was giving up,

1402
01:07:06,367 --> 01:07:09,266
but I also knew
what I was getting.

1403
01:07:10,433 --> 01:07:11,500
(Veronica chuckles)

1404
01:07:11,633 --> 01:07:13,500
He left me a voice message.

1405
01:07:13,633 --> 01:07:14,467
[Jane] Yeah?

1406
01:07:17,166 --> 01:07:22,133
He sounded really sad and
he really wanted to meet up.

1407
01:07:23,500 --> 01:07:25,066
But I, well, I was angry
and I didn't call him back.

1408
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:29,467
And then he was gone,

1409
01:07:33,300 --> 01:07:35,433
and now I'm just gonna be a
disappointment to you too.

1410
01:07:35,567 --> 01:07:36,567
- Oh, no!
- I'll never make

1411
01:07:36,700 --> 01:07:37,700
you a grandmother.

1412
01:07:37,834 --> 01:07:40,467
Honey, I am so proud of you.

1413
01:07:42,367 --> 01:07:44,433
And you'll get through
this and I will be there

1414
01:07:44,567 --> 01:07:46,633
every step of the
way right with you.

1415
01:07:48,567 --> 01:07:48,600
Okay?

1416
01:07:56,900 --> 01:07:57,767
Oh.

1417
01:07:57,900 --> 01:08:00,734
(phone ringing)

1418
01:08:01,767 --> 01:08:01,800
Okay.

1419
01:08:04,900 --> 01:08:06,500
Merry Christmas.

1420
01:08:06,633 --> 01:08:09,867
Right now?

1421
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,266
Sure, I could do that.

1422
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:15,266
Can I bring a plus one?

1423
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:18,133
This is good.

1424
01:08:19,367 --> 01:08:20,700
Mm.

1425
01:08:20,834 --> 01:08:23,734
I think I even like this
better than sour gummies.

1426
01:08:23,867 --> 01:08:25,500
(Nate chuckles)

1427
01:08:25,633 --> 01:08:29,433
How about tomorrow we'll go
get doughnuts and go sledding?

1428
01:08:29,567 --> 01:08:30,767
I call the biggest hill first.

1429
01:08:30,900 --> 01:08:33,700
(phone ringing)

1430
01:08:35,233 --> 01:08:36,734
Hello, this is...

1431
01:08:36,867 --> 01:08:37,867
Oh, hey Miguel.

1432
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:40,834
Yeah, sure, no problem.

1433
01:08:40,967 --> 01:08:42,233
We're on our way.

1434
01:08:42,367 --> 01:08:44,433
You guys, get your coats on.

1435
01:08:44,567 --> 01:08:45,533
Our friends need us.

1436
01:08:46,567 --> 01:08:54,300
Let's go.

1437
01:08:54,433 --> 01:08:55,700
Thank you all so
much for dropping

1438
01:08:55,834 --> 01:08:57,567
your Christmas
plans to come here.

1439
01:08:57,700 --> 01:09:00,600
It's going to be out of
all of our comfort zones,

1440
01:09:00,734 --> 01:09:03,967
but I think we owe the
Dragon one last hurrah.

1441
01:09:04,100 --> 01:09:05,300
We're gonna be busy.

1442
01:09:05,433 --> 01:09:06,700
Insane is more like it.

1443
01:09:06,834 --> 01:09:09,300
We already have dozens of
reservations for dinner.

1444
01:09:09,433 --> 01:09:11,467
Our usual vendors are closed,

1445
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:12,433
so we're gonna have to make do

1446
01:09:12,567 --> 01:09:14,233
with grocery meat and produce.

1447
01:09:14,367 --> 01:09:16,567
Romy and Blake, they're gonna
be on kitchen duty with me.

1448
01:09:16,700 --> 01:09:18,567
Nate, I'm gonna need
you to grab the sauce bins

1449
01:09:18,700 --> 01:09:20,367
from the fridge and fill
up all the dispensers.

1450
01:09:20,500 --> 01:09:21,433
Right.

1451
01:09:21,567 --> 01:09:22,834
from the fridge and fill
up all the dispensers.

1452
01:09:22,967 --> 01:09:25,333
so I'm gonna put you on dicing.

1453
01:09:25,467 --> 01:09:26,500
Hm.

1454
01:09:26,633 --> 01:09:27,867
Jess and Vivi,
I'm gonna teach you

1455
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,700
how to make the best hand
rolled dumplings ever.

1456
01:09:31,967 --> 01:09:34,900
Luis, I'm going to
need you to be mingling

1457
01:09:35,033 --> 01:09:37,900
in the dining room
entertaining our guests.

1458
01:09:38,033 --> 01:09:39,000
And what about me?

1459
01:09:40,333 --> 01:09:41,633
Host stand.

1460
01:09:41,767 --> 01:09:43,767
You wanna waste all this
pizazz on the host stand?

1461
01:09:43,900 --> 01:09:45,000
(all laughing)

1462
01:09:45,133 --> 01:09:47,467
You wanna waste all this
pizazz on the host stand?

1463
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:50,300
so our novice kitchen staff
doesn't get overwhelmed.

1464
01:09:50,433 --> 01:09:52,700
Oh, so I get to tell
people what to do.

1465
01:09:52,834 --> 01:09:56,700
Yes, but only
if you wear this.

1466
01:09:56,834 --> 01:10:00,500
Oh!
(all laughing)

1467
01:10:00,633 --> 01:10:03,867
May, I (throat clears)?

1468
01:10:05,867 --> 01:10:05,900
- Wow.
- That's perfect.

1469
01:10:11,900 --> 01:10:12,700
Let's get started.

1470
01:10:12,834 --> 01:10:13,700
- Ready.

1471
01:10:13,834 --> 01:10:14,900
- Let's go.
- Come on.

1472
01:10:15,033 --> 01:10:16,900
Here you are, a
fish fileting guru,

1473
01:10:17,033 --> 01:10:18,567
and yet for our first dinner,

1474
01:10:18,700 --> 01:10:20,734
you made me microwave popcorn?

1475
01:10:22,500 --> 01:10:24,500
Maybe I just
forgot how fun it is

1476
01:10:24,633 --> 01:10:25,934
to cook for people you love.

1477
01:10:27,100 --> 01:10:28,900
We have to break
them off like this

1478
01:10:29,033 --> 01:10:29,900
and throw them in here?

1479
01:10:30,033 --> 01:10:31,767
- Okay.
- Like it's a big tree

1480
01:10:31,900 --> 01:10:33,734
and you're taking
the branches off.

1481
01:10:33,867 --> 01:10:34,800
You're a natural.

1482
01:10:40,433 --> 01:10:45,400
Oh!
(knife thuds)

1483
01:10:46,567 --> 01:10:46,934
(knife chopping)
(upbeat holiday music)

1484
01:10:54,033 --> 01:10:55,300
- All right.
- You watching?

1485
01:10:55,433 --> 01:10:56,467
[Blake] I'm watching.

1486
01:10:57,767 --> 01:10:58,500
All right, you get a bundle.

1487
01:10:58,633 --> 01:10:59,500
Okay.

1488
01:10:59,633 --> 01:11:01,033
- And stir it.
- That's it?

1489
01:11:01,166 --> 01:11:01,900
That's all I have to do?

1490
01:11:02,033 --> 01:11:03,033
That's it,

1491
01:11:03,166 --> 01:11:04,367
and just wait a minute.
- I can do that.

1492
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:06,367
- Oh, oh!
- Jeez, all right.

1493
01:11:06,500 --> 01:11:07,800
Hey, guys, guys, hey, hey,

1494
01:11:07,934 --> 01:11:09,900
break it up, break it up,
break it up, break it up.

1495
01:11:11,500 --> 01:11:11,533
Dude, you're leaving?

1496
01:11:14,767 --> 01:11:16,033
There's just a stop
I have to make.

1497
01:11:16,166 --> 01:11:18,633
Well, what's more
important than this?

1498
01:11:18,767 --> 01:11:19,800
(exhales) My life.

1499
01:11:20,934 --> 01:11:20,967
What?

1500
01:11:24,633 --> 01:11:27,300
I don't think I can
live with regret.

1501
01:11:27,433 --> 01:11:29,867
(gentle music)

1502
01:11:37,033 --> 01:11:38,300
(music continues)

1503
01:11:38,433 --> 01:11:39,667
(Rick exhales)

1504
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:40,633
Rick?

1505
01:11:42,767 --> 01:11:44,800
What are you doing here?

1506
01:11:44,934 --> 01:11:48,000
And why are you dressed
like a 1980s wedding singer?

1507
01:11:49,900 --> 01:11:49,934
This was the last tie
they had at the shop.

1508
01:11:53,533 --> 01:11:56,000
Will you please go

1509
01:11:57,500 --> 01:12:01,433
to the Dragon tonight
at eight wearing this?

1510
01:12:03,633 --> 01:12:04,567
And that dress I never
got to see you in?

1511
01:12:04,700 --> 01:12:08,800
Sadie Cohen,

1512
01:12:08,934 --> 01:12:13,433
will you go to prom with me?

1513
01:12:14,834 --> 01:12:17,467
(gentle music)

1514
01:12:25,467 --> 01:12:28,133
(music continues)

1515
01:12:30,500 --> 01:12:34,100
You know, you can't
just do one big gesture

1516
01:12:34,233 --> 01:12:35,900
and then expect
everything to be forgiven.

1517
01:12:36,033 --> 01:12:36,867
I know that,

1518
01:12:38,133 --> 01:12:39,834
which is why I just
want this to be

1519
01:12:39,967 --> 01:12:44,867
the first teensy eensy littlest
possible step towards that.

1520
01:12:48,767 --> 01:12:49,500
That's it.

1521
01:12:49,633 --> 01:12:52,467
(music continues)

1522
01:12:58,900 --> 01:13:01,800
(all chattering)

1523
01:13:09,066 --> 01:13:10,033
Ta da.

1524
01:13:10,166 --> 01:13:12,100
My table.

1525
01:13:12,233 --> 01:13:14,033
So this is where
all the magic happens?

1526
01:13:14,166 --> 01:13:16,800
All the major milestones
in my life happened here.

1527
01:13:18,166 --> 01:13:18,200
Care to add one more?

1528
01:13:24,066 --> 01:13:26,767
Are you asking me what
I think you're asking me?

1529
01:13:26,900 --> 01:13:29,667
Because I am going
to be so mad at you

1530
01:13:29,800 --> 01:13:30,934
that my engagement
selfie is of me

1531
01:13:31,066 --> 01:13:33,433
in a sesame oil stained shirt.

1532
01:13:33,567 --> 01:13:35,533
Life isn't perfect.

1533
01:13:35,667 --> 01:13:40,500
Christmas isn't perfect,
couples aren't perfect.

1534
01:13:42,667 --> 01:13:44,900
But sometimes it's
the imperfections

1535
01:13:45,033 --> 01:13:47,934
that make something
so worthwhile.

1536
01:13:51,100 --> 01:13:51,133
You're right.

1537
01:13:56,066 --> 01:14:00,867
I want all the messy and
difficult and awkward things.

1538
01:14:02,367 --> 01:14:04,800
I wanna learn and grow and
remember and be grateful.

1539
01:14:04,934 --> 01:14:09,700
I wanna do all of that with you.

1540
01:14:09,834 --> 01:14:14,233
Romy Chen, will you marry me?

1541
01:14:15,734 --> 01:14:20,166
(Romy giggles)
(bright music)

1542
01:14:24,300 --> 01:14:28,600
(Romy laughs)

1543
01:14:28,734 --> 01:14:33,300
You may say there are
no perfect Christmases,

1544
01:14:35,900 --> 01:14:38,700
but I beg to differ.

1545
01:14:42,900 --> 01:14:45,033
(Blake laughs)

1546
01:14:45,166 --> 01:14:46,767
I love it.
- You do? Good.

1547
01:14:46,900 --> 01:14:51,867
I love it.
(Blake laughs)

1548
01:14:53,233 --> 01:14:56,033
I can't believe
that kid sneaking out

1549
01:14:56,166 --> 01:14:59,166
on Christmas and making me
come out in the cold like this.

1550
01:14:59,300 --> 01:15:00,200
He's lost, Jim.

1551
01:15:00,333 --> 01:15:02,033
He's still searching for his...

1552
01:15:08,233 --> 01:15:11,667
(customers chattering)

1553
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:15,767
(bright holiday music playing)

1554
01:15:21,834 --> 01:15:22,734
What's going on?

1555
01:15:23,700 --> 01:15:25,900
Your last dinner service.

1556
01:15:26,033 --> 01:15:29,200
Mom, Dad, I'll take
you to your table.

1557
01:15:33,233 --> 01:15:34,066
This way.

1558
01:15:35,767 --> 01:15:37,100
How did you pull this off?

1559
01:15:37,233 --> 01:15:39,900
It was mostly Romy's idea.

1560
01:15:40,033 --> 01:15:41,300
Romy?

1561
01:15:41,433 --> 01:15:44,633
I may be jet lagged and
I definitely need a shower,

1562
01:15:44,767 --> 01:15:47,166
but I would never miss
our last Christmas here!

1563
01:15:47,300 --> 01:15:49,200
Oh, Romy!

1564
01:15:52,100 --> 01:15:54,700
I invited some regulars.

1565
01:15:54,834 --> 01:15:56,100
Plus I texted every phone number

1566
01:15:56,233 --> 01:15:58,100
from last year's
Christmas reservations.

1567
01:15:58,233 --> 01:15:59,233
I might have carpal tunnel,

1568
01:15:59,367 --> 01:16:02,000
but it got us a
pretty decent crowd.

1569
01:16:02,133 --> 01:16:04,033
Oh, you didn't have
to do this for us.

1570
01:16:04,166 --> 01:16:07,266
You've served all of
us all of these years,

1571
01:16:07,400 --> 01:16:09,233
now it's time for
you to be served.

1572
01:16:12,100 --> 01:16:15,033
Ah, Ma, this is Blake.

1573
01:16:15,166 --> 01:16:17,834
Blake, meet my
wonderful parents.

1574
01:16:17,967 --> 01:16:18,834
Blake!

1575
01:16:18,967 --> 01:16:19,800
Hi (laughs).

1576
01:16:21,967 --> 01:16:24,033
Why aren't you
with your family?

1577
01:16:24,166 --> 01:16:27,667
Well, Romy is family now.

1578
01:16:29,100 --> 01:16:30,600
We're engaged!

1579
01:16:30,734 --> 01:16:33,133
Oh, Romy! That's wonderful.

1580
01:16:34,367 --> 01:16:35,333
Don't worry, the
real ring's coming

1581
01:16:38,500 --> 01:16:40,900
Welcome to the family, son.
(Romy laughs)

1582
01:16:41,033 --> 01:16:43,734
(all laughing)

1583
01:16:45,033 --> 01:16:45,300
Come, come.
- All right, all right.

1584
01:16:56,867 --> 01:17:00,433
(light jazzy holiday music)

1585
01:17:06,200 --> 01:17:07,033
Wow.

1586
01:17:08,567 --> 01:17:11,367
I can't believe I almost missed
seeing you in this dress.

1587
01:17:11,500 --> 01:17:13,900
I can't believe this dress
still actually fits me.

1588
01:17:14,033 --> 01:17:16,233
(Rick chuckles)

1589
01:17:16,367 --> 01:17:19,000
Don't leave me alone on
the dance floor, Rick Chen.

1590
01:17:19,900 --> 01:17:20,967
No, Ma'am.

1591
01:17:21,100 --> 01:17:26,033
(music continues)
(all chattering)

1592
01:17:42,233 --> 01:17:43,033
(upbeat music)
(singer vocalizing)

1593
01:17:43,166 --> 01:17:44,467
Oh, what is this?

1594
01:17:46,233 --> 01:17:47,667
Can I please have this dance?

1595
01:17:47,800 --> 01:17:51,667
(music continues)
(singer vocalizing)

1596
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:54,433
(all applauding)

1597
01:17:58,500 --> 01:18:00,266
♪ Got a little piece of heaven ♪

1598
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:02,900
So, I was thinking that
I might check out LA

1599
01:18:03,033 --> 01:18:05,934
and see if I can find a job
as a sous chef somewhere.

1600
01:18:07,367 --> 01:18:07,400
Do you know anyone with a couch
that I could crash on maybe?

1601
01:18:17,900 --> 01:18:19,333
I want you in my life, Sadie.

1602
01:18:20,300 --> 01:18:22,734
And if that means friendship,

1603
01:18:22,867 --> 01:18:25,500
and nothing romantic would
ever happen, that's fine.

1604
01:18:25,633 --> 01:18:28,033
That the price I pay.

1607
01:18:38,100 --> 01:18:39,166
Okay.

(singer vocalizing)
(music continues)

1609
01:18:47,166 --> 01:18:48,433
Oh, ah!

1610
01:18:48,567 --> 01:18:50,367
(Veronica laughs)

1611
01:18:50,500 --> 01:18:52,834
I'm gonna have the best
story to tell for the,

1612
01:18:52,967 --> 01:18:54,033
"What I did for my
Christmas vacation"

1613
01:18:54,166 --> 01:18:55,300
portion of the
company newsletter.

1614
01:18:55,433 --> 01:18:56,433
Don't you dare.

1615
01:18:56,567 --> 01:18:58,233
(Veronica laughs)
(Nate laughs)

1616
01:18:58,367 --> 01:19:01,934
Oh!

1617
01:19:09,233 --> 01:19:12,133

Hm.

1621
01:19:23,300 --> 01:19:23,333
Pretty impressive.

1622
01:19:28,433 --> 01:19:31,900
(chuckles) Creativity
is important,

1623
01:19:32,033 --> 01:19:35,367
but you have got to get
the basics down too.

1624
01:19:35,500 --> 01:19:37,900
You can show me
some tricks sometime.

1625
01:19:38,033 --> 01:19:39,467
I'd like nothing better, Son.

1626
01:19:40,500 --> 01:19:40,533
Thanks, Dad.

1627
01:19:45,100 --> 01:19:46,567
(Luis speaking in Spanish)

1628
01:19:46,700 --> 01:19:49,433
We understand that this tree

1629
01:19:49,567 --> 01:19:53,300
has ornaments from all
your customers and friends.

1630
01:19:53,433 --> 01:19:54,934
(Luis speaking in Spanish)

1631
01:19:55,066 --> 01:19:59,333
Before you turn that
sign to close for good,

1632
01:19:59,467 --> 01:20:01,333
we would like to
give you something.

1633
01:20:03,700 --> 01:20:06,567
Me abuelito, my
grandfather gave me this

1634
01:20:06,700 --> 01:20:08,166
when I was just a boy.

1635
01:20:09,700 --> 01:20:11,567
We were leaving Guadalajara

1636
01:20:11,700 --> 01:20:15,567
on Christmas Eve
to come to America,

1637
01:20:15,700 --> 01:20:18,033
and he knew then
that we probably

1638
01:20:18,166 --> 01:20:20,266
would not see each other again.

1639
01:20:23,233 --> 01:20:23,834
(speaking in Spanish)
Saint Christopher

1640
01:20:31,033 --> 01:20:32,333
I remember that feeling

1641
01:20:33,500 --> 01:20:37,367
when we left our homes
to come to the U.S.

1642
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:42,266
It was pure hope and pure
fear at the same time.

1643
01:20:43,433 --> 01:20:46,333
I was so anxious
that I accidentally

1644
01:20:46,467 --> 01:20:49,166
wore two different
shoes on the flight.

1645
01:20:49,300 --> 01:20:51,467
(all laughing)

1646
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:55,266
I remember that (laughs).

1647
01:20:56,700 --> 01:20:56,734
I made this in preschool
when I was two or three.

1648
01:21:08,233 --> 01:21:09,600
I made this special for you.

1649
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:16,133
Thank you.

1650
01:21:16,266 --> 01:21:19,967
This is symbolic
so that I remember

1651
01:21:20,100 --> 01:21:23,667
to love myself as much
as I love anyone else.

1652
01:21:29,100 --> 01:21:31,300
My mom got this from
me after my dad won

1653
01:21:31,433 --> 01:21:33,500
his first NCAA tournament game.

1654
01:21:34,700 --> 01:21:36,633
She was so proud of him,

1655
01:21:36,767 --> 01:21:39,333
but of course I never even
took it out of the box.

1656
01:21:43,100 --> 01:21:43,133
My dad loved it here,

1657
01:21:46,567 --> 01:21:50,633
Even though I didn't show it.

1658
01:21:52,433 --> 01:21:55,633
(bright holiday music)

1659
01:22:00,100 --> 01:22:00,967
Oh, honey.

1660
01:22:01,100 --> 01:22:03,700
(music continues)

1661
01:22:06,367 --> 01:22:06,400
We'll remember
that wherever we are,

1662
01:22:12,767 --> 01:22:14,467
this family with us.

1663
01:22:18,433 --> 01:22:21,266
(music continues)

1664
01:22:29,066 --> 01:22:31,734
(music continues)

1665
01:22:35,700 --> 01:22:37,467
[Romy] Here's the thing,

1666
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:40,300
Christmas looks
different for everyone.

1667
01:22:40,433 --> 01:22:41,967
Maybe it's embracing the change

1668
01:22:42,100 --> 01:22:43,433
to create new traditions,
- So impressive

1669
01:22:43,567 --> 01:22:44,400
you're bilingual.

1670
01:22:44,533 --> 01:22:46,233
to create new traditions,
- So impressive

1671
01:22:46,367 --> 01:22:48,967
a part of achieving our dreams.

1672
01:22:49,100 --> 01:22:50,600
It could be letting
go of expectations

1673
01:22:50,734 --> 01:22:53,633
around what you think
the holidays should be.

1674
01:22:53,767 --> 01:22:55,500
Pushing forward with
resilience and hope

1675
01:22:55,633 --> 01:22:57,233
to create a new normal,

1676
01:22:57,367 --> 01:23:01,767
and understanding that our
challenges don't define us.

1677
01:23:01,900 --> 01:23:06,000
Christmas makes us realize we
may actually find everything

1678
01:23:06,133 --> 01:23:09,233
we want if we adjust
our perspective.

1679
01:23:09,367 --> 01:23:12,033
And it doesn't matter if
we throw festive parties,

1680
01:23:12,166 --> 01:23:15,767
or watch football, or
even roll dumplings.

1681
01:23:15,900 --> 01:23:16,800
It's Mom.

1682
01:23:16,934 --> 01:23:18,100
or watch football, or
even roll dumplings.

1683
01:23:18,233 --> 01:23:20,367
if you spend it with family,

1684
01:23:20,500 --> 01:23:23,667
because the greatest gifts
can't be traveled to,

1685
01:23:23,800 --> 01:23:27,300
owned, earned,
worn, or consumed.

1686
01:23:27,433 --> 01:23:30,367
The greatest gift we can
give ourselves and others

1687
01:23:30,500 --> 01:23:32,433
is living in the present,

1688
01:23:32,567 --> 01:23:34,300
and being grateful
for the lessons

1689
01:23:34,433 --> 01:23:36,400
we've learned
throughout the year.

1690
01:23:36,533 --> 01:23:39,200
And maybe fry a few egg
rolls while you're at it.
