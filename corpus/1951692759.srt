1
00:00:17,584 --> 00:00:20,314
#I'll sleep all day,
out all night #

2
00:00:20,353 --> 00:00:23,117
# I know where you're going #

3
00:00:23,156 --> 00:00:25,647
# I don't think
that's acting right #

4
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:29,025
# You don't think it's showing #

5
00:00:31,097 --> 00:00:32,655
I'm hearing reservations.

6
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:34,690
Ten yards out, for you?

7
00:00:34,734 --> 00:00:36,668
Come on, man. It's like
hitting the side of a barn.

8
00:00:37,737 --> 00:00:39,364
Come on, Johnny. We're late.

9
00:00:39,839 --> 00:00:42,171
All right.
So then, let's sweeten the pot.

10
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:44,267
We'll back it up to twenty,
and I won't be the shooter.

11
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:46,278
My sister will be.

12
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,711
What? Her?

13
00:00:48,748 --> 00:00:49,737
Me?

14
00:00:49,783 --> 00:00:50,943
Yeah.

15
00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:55,352
Five bucks says it's so cake,
even my sister can do it.

16
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:56,650
There's no way I can hit that.

17
00:00:56,689 --> 00:00:57,781
She says she can't do it.

18
00:00:57,824 --> 00:00:58,813
I'll be right behind you.

19
00:00:58,858 --> 00:01:00,655
No, look.

20
00:01:00,693 --> 00:01:02,160
What's she doing?

21
00:01:02,195 --> 00:01:03,560
Flip-flops.

22
00:01:05,698 --> 00:01:06,858
Well, so, take 'em off.

23
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,299
#... all your plans #

24
00:01:08,334 --> 00:01:10,632
What you tryin'
to hand me?

25
00:01:13,673 --> 00:01:16,267
Five bucks. One shot.

26
00:01:16,309 --> 00:01:18,140
And the chick's
gonna shoot barefoot?

27
00:01:18,178 --> 00:01:19,475
Her name's Gracie.

28
00:01:19,512 --> 00:01:20,843
Yeah, whatever.

29
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,472
You're on.

30
00:01:22,515 --> 00:01:23,914
It's your money.

31
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:27,116
Okay, see the target?

32
00:01:27,153 --> 00:01:28,279
Yeah.

33
00:01:28,321 --> 00:01:29,310
You don't want to
look at the target.

34
00:01:29,355 --> 00:01:30,583
You want to keep
your ankle locked...

35
00:01:30,623 --> 00:01:32,181
and your toes pointing down.

36
00:01:32,225 --> 00:01:33,453
- Got it.
- Right. Okay, good.

37
00:01:33,493 --> 00:01:35,188
So when you strike the ball...

38
00:01:35,228 --> 00:01:36,820
you want to make solid contact
with your instep here.

39
00:01:36,863 --> 00:01:38,296
You're gonna follow
through the target.

40
00:01:38,331 --> 00:01:39,958
All right, come on, man.
Let's go.

41
00:01:39,999 --> 00:01:42,160
Okay. Now, your plant foot...

42
00:01:42,202 --> 00:01:43,794
you want
to keep even with the ball...

43
00:01:43,837 --> 00:01:45,998
and then your kicking foot
is gonna go over the ball.

44
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:47,165
It's too much to remember.

45
00:01:47,207 --> 00:01:48,299
Don't worry about it.

46
00:01:48,341 --> 00:01:50,366
Just wait till you're ready

47
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:52,469
You can do anything.

48
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:32,712
Fun game. What's it called?

49
00:02:37,857 --> 00:02:40,917
#Don't look back,
a new day is breaking #

50
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,949
# It's been too long #

51
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:43,189
Here.

52
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:46,062
# Since I felt this way
I don't mind #

53
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:47,760
Johnny, here.

54
00:02:49,302 --> 00:02:50,826
Johnny.

55
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:53,168
# Today is the day #

56
00:02:53,206 --> 00:02:54,696
Come on, come on.

57
00:02:54,741 --> 00:02:57,209
Over here. Whoops.

58
00:02:59,245 --> 00:03:03,147
# I'm much too strong
not to compromise #

59
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,810
Johnny. Here.

60
00:03:06,452 --> 00:03:08,443
Whoa.

61
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:12,588
Barefoot?

62
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:14,490
Never a doubt in my mind.

63
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:16,154
You owe me a pair of flip-flops.

64
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:17,185
Let's go.
Get back. Get back.

65
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,595
Shit.

66
00:03:18,631 --> 00:03:19,620
Come on. You got to move
your feet faster.

67
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:22,692
Mike, catch up.
Cross over. Get moving.

68
00:03:22,735 --> 00:03:24,066
That's it. That's it.

69
00:03:26,306 --> 00:03:27,933
Where the hell were you?

70
00:03:27,974 --> 00:03:30,738
I took off overtime hours.
Peter and your brothers made it.

71
00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:35,845
All right, Johnny.
Let's go. Pass and shoot drill.

72
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:37,213
I'll be the goalie.

73
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,649
Mike, Daniel, get in the goal.

74
00:03:38,685 --> 00:03:41,119
Hustle, hustle.

75
00:03:41,154 --> 00:03:42,883
Here you go, Peter.

76
00:03:42,922 --> 00:03:44,685
I want clean passes.
That's it.

77
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:46,055
And shot.

78
00:03:46,092 --> 00:03:47,354
All right, Johnny, let's see it.

79
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:49,020
And shot.
That's it. That's it.

80
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:50,689
I could shag balls.

81
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,960
Peter, get it to him.

82
00:03:52,999 --> 00:03:54,523
Oh, your mom
was calling you before.

83
00:03:55,468 --> 00:03:56,662
Shoot, Johnny.

84
00:03:56,703 --> 00:03:59,194
That's it. What a shot.

85
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,263
Good left foot.

86
00:04:03,376 --> 00:04:04,502
Here, honey.

87
00:04:04,544 --> 00:04:05,841
Paper says
you're gonna beat Kingston.

88
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:07,368
They're gonna take State.
It's a done deal.

89
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:10,007
No, no, no.
Johnny will take 'em down.

90
00:04:10,049 --> 00:04:11,539
They're animals.

91
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:13,176
They're bigger.
They're stronger.

92
00:04:13,219 --> 00:04:14,743
How's that view
from the bench?

93
00:04:14,787 --> 00:04:16,118
It's better than yours
from the stands.

94
00:04:16,155 --> 00:04:18,453
You gotta want it more, Johnny.

95
00:04:18,491 --> 00:04:19,719
Here, Dad.

96
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,192
But they've got the giant.

97
00:04:21,227 --> 00:04:22,421
But he can't play soccer.

98
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:24,089
He just knocks
everybody over. No skills.

99
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:25,290
This is our year.

100
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:27,526
Can we talk
about something else, please?

101
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:28,556
There is nothing else.

102
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:29,727
Oh, really?

103
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:32,397
We should play a 44-2 and
double-team that guy McMann?

104
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:34,338
And you read that
on what cereal box?

105
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:35,864
Daniel.

106
00:04:35,908 --> 00:04:38,274
Questions give the impression
one is interested.

107
00:04:38,311 --> 00:04:39,835
And you're not interested?

108
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:41,744
To what she says?

109
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:43,976
Girls lose their brains
when their boobs grow.

110
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:46,110
Then Grace must be really smart.

111
00:04:49,322 --> 00:04:50,584
You guys
both took four meatballs.

112
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:51,988
Fill that for her.

113
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:54,755
We played. She didn't.

114
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:56,489
It's not like
you eat here every night...

115
00:04:56,529 --> 00:04:58,224
just because the food's good.

116
00:04:58,264 --> 00:04:59,822
All right, fine.
It's her pick then.

117
00:04:59,866 --> 00:05:01,197
Take what you want, Grace.

118
00:05:02,502 --> 00:05:04,026
I'll take this one.

119
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:08,734
And I'll have this
for maximum boob growth.

120
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:10,965
Elmer's hungry, huh?

121
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:12,875
That bird's never gonna fly.

122
00:05:12,912 --> 00:05:14,937
Tell him that
and he never will.

123
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:16,414
You stretch out?

124
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:17,438
Yeah. Yeah.

125
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:19,280
Yeah. Yeah.

126
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:22,015
Well, don't stretch out too
fast, so you don't cramp up.

127
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:25,681
Is Johnny still
polishing his cleats?

128
00:05:26,893 --> 00:05:28,952
It's been almost
an hour already.

129
00:05:29,929 --> 00:05:31,863
He does it for luck.

130
00:05:31,898 --> 00:05:33,525
He does it because
he's afraid to lose.

131
00:05:33,566 --> 00:05:35,796
Could have
some rain tonight.

132
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:37,496
You know what they do
in baseball, of course.

133
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:38,970
They roll out a tarp
and everybody goes...

134
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:40,666
to the locker room
and put their street clothes on.

135
00:05:41,874 --> 00:05:43,205
Not in soccer, you know,
you just play through...

136
00:05:43,242 --> 00:05:45,574
and in football
they just keep stopping.

137
00:05:45,611 --> 00:05:46,873
You stretch out yet?

138
00:05:46,913 --> 00:05:48,005
Yeah, Dad. Yeah.

139
00:05:48,047 --> 00:05:49,241
Well, do it again
before the game starts...

140
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:50,408
and just do it slow.

141
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:51,439
You don't want to cramp up.

142
00:05:51,484 --> 00:05:54,419
Maybe they'll call it off.

143
00:05:57,623 --> 00:05:58,851
All right,
let's play some offense here!

144
00:06:00,827 --> 00:06:02,351
- Go! Let's go!
- To the side.

145
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:07,966
Watch where you're goin'!

146
00:06:08,968 --> 00:06:09,957
Look for him, Johnny.

147
00:06:10,002 --> 00:06:11,299
Look for him. He's open.

148
00:06:12,905 --> 00:06:13,929
Good hustle, Johnny!

149
00:06:19,645 --> 00:06:20,634
Come on!

150
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,704
Let's go.

151
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:27,243
Coming your way.

152
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:30,352
Hey.

153
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,985
What are you doing?
You don't even like soccer.

154
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:37,496
I'm here for Donny...

155
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:39,760
Teddy...

156
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:41,323
and Kyle.

157
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:44,200
All right, let's go!
Let's go! Let's go!

158
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:46,102
Move the ball!
Move the ball!

159
00:06:47,006 --> 00:06:49,702
Move it! Move it! Move it!
Pass it to Johnny!

160
00:06:55,448 --> 00:06:57,006
There it is! There it is1

161
00:06:58,050 --> 00:06:59,039
Yes!

162
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:00,109
Yeah!

163
00:07:07,994 --> 00:07:09,723
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

164
00:07:12,198 --> 00:07:13,825
For you.

165
00:07:13,866 --> 00:07:16,733
Dude, he totally likes you.

166
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:18,828
Why won't you go out with him?
You should.

167
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,071
Never said I didn't.

168
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:25,043
I mean, come on, the only guy
hotter is, like, your dad.

169
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,073
I'm just kidding.
Your dad is old.

170
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:29,172
Pick up your man!

171
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:30,771
That's it!

172
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:31,875
Yeah!

173
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:33,579
Pick up the giant!

174
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:35,814
Pick him up! Pick him up!

175
00:07:35,855 --> 00:07:37,379
Yeah!

176
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:39,424
He walked in there!

177
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,363
Yeah!

178
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:46,763
That's one.

179
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:48,391
That's it? We lost?

180
00:07:48,434 --> 00:07:51,130
No, we're going
into penalty kicks.

181
00:07:56,776 --> 00:07:58,073
Get 'em!
All right, let's go.

182
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:00,944
All right, all right,
all right.

183
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:21,857
Yes!

184
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:24,301
Chuck! Chuck!

185
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:28,530
Kingston! Kingston!

186
00:08:28,574 --> 00:08:30,769
Kingston! Kingston!

187
00:08:34,947 --> 00:08:36,471
Yeah!

188
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:37,881
Did Kingston win?

189
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:39,145
No.
They have the go-ahead goal.

190
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:40,880
If we don't score, we lose.

191
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:45,483
Let's go. Let's go.

192
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,152
Come on, now.
Shoot 'em dead, Johnny.

193
00:09:03,175 --> 00:09:04,506
Miss it!

194
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:32,303
Come on, Johnny!

195
00:09:33,606 --> 00:09:36,166
Wait till you're ready.

196
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:37,641
- You can do anything.
- You can do anything.

197
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:55,286
Kingston! Kingston!

198
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:58,195
Kingston! Kingston!
Kingston!

199
00:10:21,821 --> 00:10:23,413
Hey, is he in there?

200
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:24,480
Last one.

201
00:10:35,267 --> 00:10:36,529
Hey.

202
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:43,969
You scored a great goal.

203
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:46,069
Did Dad send you?

204
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:47,238
No.

205
00:10:49,248 --> 00:10:51,443
You're not supposed
to be in here.

206
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:52,917
Your team's waiting.

207
00:10:57,356 --> 00:10:59,847
It was supposed to go in.

208
00:10:59,892 --> 00:11:02,087
I put it right there.

209
00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:03,459
I blew it.

210
00:11:12,772 --> 00:11:14,501
"You know what, son?

211
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:17,509
"You win as a team
and you lose as a team."

212
00:11:17,543 --> 00:11:19,670
Yeah, screw Dad.

213
00:11:22,114 --> 00:11:23,604
You know what? You're right.

214
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:25,480
You really sucked out there.

215
00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:30,415
Yeah, I did. Big time.

216
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:36,118
Come on. Let's go.

217
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:52,838
Love you.

218
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,004
Come on, Johnny.
Let's roll.

219
00:12:21,373 --> 00:12:23,967
A drunk driver.
He was pulled from the car.

220
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:26,068
The other boys are banged up.

221
00:12:26,112 --> 00:12:29,081
Where's Johnny?
Which hospital is he in?

222
00:12:30,349 --> 00:12:31,816
Lindsay, Johnny didn't make it.

223
00:12:31,851 --> 00:12:33,250
I'm gonna get my purse.

224
00:12:33,285 --> 00:12:34,377
Lindsay, Johnny didn't make it.

225
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,320
No!

226
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:39,555
Oh, no!

227
00:12:43,295 --> 00:12:46,230
No! No!

228
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:19,483
Aah!

229
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:35,340
What color was the car?

230
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:38,138
It's the Walker's car.
It's maroon.

231
00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:39,303
How fast was it going?

232
00:14:39,345 --> 00:14:40,334
I don't know.

233
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:41,971
What if somebody
asks something?

234
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:43,481
Tell them the truth,
that he died in a car accident.

235
00:14:43,515 --> 00:14:44,914
What if they want details?

236
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:46,645
There are no details.

237
00:14:46,685 --> 00:14:49,654
He died instantly.
He didn't see it coming.

238
00:14:49,688 --> 00:14:50,780
And dying doesn't hurt.

239
00:14:50,823 --> 00:14:51,847
Was there lots of blood?

240
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:54,655
No. No more questions, okay?

241
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:57,256
Hey, Peter, come on in.

242
00:14:57,863 --> 00:14:59,831
Still giving rides to school?

243
00:14:59,865 --> 00:15:01,560
Do we have to go?

244
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,966
Yes. Everybody goes today...

245
00:15:05,604 --> 00:15:07,196
and tonight.

246
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:09,434
You're taking
your grandpa, okay?

247
00:15:09,475 --> 00:15:11,375
Here, Dad.

248
00:15:13,445 --> 00:15:16,608
The most improved
junior varsity player...

249
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:19,812
a player who surprised us all
this year with 15 assists...

250
00:15:19,852 --> 00:15:21,149
Neil Nielson.

251
00:15:21,186 --> 00:15:22,585
Come on up here, Neil.

252
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:25,982
Congratulations.

253
00:15:26,025 --> 00:15:27,322
Thanks, Mr. C.

254
00:15:27,359 --> 00:15:28,553
We're all proud of you, son.

255
00:15:33,966 --> 00:15:35,524
I couldn't let
this evening pass...

256
00:15:35,567 --> 00:15:38,331
without saying a few words
about a boy who is not here.

257
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:39,359
A boy who was not only...

258
00:15:39,405 --> 00:15:41,168
an extraordinarily
gifted athlete...

259
00:15:41,206 --> 00:15:44,972
but also the best
all-around human being...

260
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:47,205
I've ever had
the honor of coaching.

261
00:15:47,246 --> 00:15:49,771
Bryan, would you like to come
up here and say a few words?

262
00:15:54,586 --> 00:15:55,712
Thanks.

263
00:15:58,157 --> 00:15:59,715
Um, thanks, Coach.

264
00:15:59,758 --> 00:16:02,318
Um, Johnny
really loved you guys...

265
00:16:02,361 --> 00:16:04,556
and he loved this game.

266
00:16:04,596 --> 00:16:06,029
He loved this place.

267
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:09,759
More than anything...

268
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:13,033
he wanted to beat Kingston
and make our town proud.

269
00:16:14,006 --> 00:16:15,530
Never saw that win.

270
00:16:19,345 --> 00:16:21,142
But don't be sad for him.

271
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,145
You know what? Just go out
there next season...

272
00:16:27,186 --> 00:16:29,245
and beat those bastards,
all right?

273
00:16:31,457 --> 00:16:33,220
You can still do it.
It's what he wanted.

274
00:16:36,295 --> 00:16:39,492
You can make it happen...
for Johnny.

275
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:48,617
I have an announcement.

276
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,150
She got her period.

277
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:53,389
I know how to beat Kingston
next season.

278
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:55,423
I'm gonna play
in Johnny's place.

279
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:56,627
Dad's gonna train me.

280
00:18:56,668 --> 00:18:58,693
We have nine months
before tryouts.

281
00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:13,415
You had to laugh?

282
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,287
Grace, sweetie, I'm sorry.

283
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:17,310
You wouldn't have laughed
if it was Mike or Danny.

284
00:19:17,356 --> 00:19:19,290
Well, they're boys.

285
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:20,450
You said at the banquet...

286
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:21,789
you said, "Go out there
and beat Kingston."

287
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:23,089
I didn't mean you.

288
00:19:26,598 --> 00:19:28,532
Watch this. Top corner.

289
00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:31,503
Good, but not good enough.

290
00:19:31,537 --> 00:19:32,799
What are you talking about?

291
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:34,362
That was right
in the upper corner.

292
00:19:34,406 --> 00:19:35,703
There's no goalie.
Nobody blocking you.

293
00:19:35,741 --> 00:19:36,935
There's nothing on it.

294
00:19:36,975 --> 00:19:37,964
I drilled it.

295
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,740
It was a terrible shot.
You hit the post.

296
00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:41,768
That's crap.

297
00:19:41,813 --> 00:19:42,802
It was a meatball.

298
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:43,837
My grandmother could have
knocked it down...

299
00:19:43,882 --> 00:19:45,008
with her handbag.

300
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:48,679
Peter. Peter, get out here.
You're playin'.

301
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,620
Come on. I want you
one-on-one to the goal.

302
00:19:50,656 --> 00:19:51,680
You want to play soccer?

303
00:19:51,723 --> 00:19:52,985
Don't go easy on me.

304
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,583
There's the ball. Play ball.

305
00:19:54,626 --> 00:19:56,651
Wide right.

306
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:59,960
Again. Right now. Play ball.

307
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:03,333
Get around him.

308
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:04,357
Oh.

309
00:20:04,403 --> 00:20:05,597
Bryan, that's enough.

310
00:20:05,637 --> 00:20:06,831
Again.

311
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:07,861
You're gonna do it.

312
00:20:07,906 --> 00:20:09,806
Come on. Show me.

313
00:20:15,247 --> 00:20:16,578
Bryan, I said that's enough!

314
00:20:16,615 --> 00:20:17,604
Get out of here!

315
00:20:17,649 --> 00:20:19,776
Peter, get dry.
Get in the house.

316
00:20:19,818 --> 00:20:21,479
I'm calling it, Grace.

317
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,919
Dad, I can do this!

318
00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:24,616
- No. No, you can't.
- Yes, I can!

319
00:20:24,656 --> 00:20:26,920
You can't even beat him, and
he's not on the starting team!

320
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:27,983
Yes, I can!

321
00:20:28,026 --> 00:20:29,926
It's this simple.
You're not tough enough.

322
00:20:29,962 --> 00:20:30,986
They're gonna cream you.

323
00:20:31,863 --> 00:20:33,023
It's not gonna happen.

324
00:20:37,636 --> 00:20:41,766
Grace. Grace, sweetheart.

325
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:45,736
- Stop. Stop.

326
00:20:45,777 --> 00:20:46,869
- No.
- Stop it.

327
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:52,839
Daddy.

328
00:20:52,884 --> 00:20:55,546
Dad, please help me.

329
00:20:59,324 --> 00:21:00,518
No.

330
00:21:20,812 --> 00:21:22,609
Not everything's possible.

331
00:21:23,982 --> 00:21:25,643
It was for Johnny.

332
00:21:27,552 --> 00:21:28,951
It's different for you
because you're a girl.

333
00:21:28,987 --> 00:21:30,887
It's just a lot harder.

334
00:21:32,491 --> 00:21:34,891
You know, my mom used to say
that for us girls...

335
00:21:34,926 --> 00:21:38,657
life is one big shit sandwich,
and we all got to take a bite.

336
00:21:41,767 --> 00:21:43,894
Is that what you did?

337
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:50,228
It was a series
of personal hardships...

338
00:22:50,268 --> 00:22:51,257
and political defeats...

339
00:22:51,303 --> 00:22:53,168
that gave him
the moral courage to stand up...

340
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:54,467
and face
these presidential races.

341
00:22:54,506 --> 00:22:56,030
Hey, you know, I want
those outlines tomorrow.

342
00:22:56,074 --> 00:22:57,371
I have some exams here.

343
00:22:57,409 --> 00:22:59,900
Himmelman, Sanchez...

344
00:22:59,945 --> 00:23:01,572
Gracie, can I see you a sec?

345
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:07,584
Your exam was totally blank.
Should I fail you?

346
00:23:07,619 --> 00:23:10,782
Gracie, you're gonna have
to step up for the next one. L...

347
00:23:10,822 --> 00:23:12,483
I can overlook this one.

348
00:23:12,524 --> 00:23:14,116
I gotta get going.

349
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:17,322
Do you want to talk
to somebody? The nurse?

350
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:21,293
My mother is the nurse.

351
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:22,766
Gracie, like this.

352
00:23:22,801 --> 00:23:27,898
# Don't leave me hanging
on the telephone #

353
00:23:27,939 --> 00:23:29,839
This way, the smoke
won't burn your eyes.

354
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:31,274
Kyle's gonna be captain
next year.

355
00:23:31,309 --> 00:23:32,833
He tell you?

356
00:23:32,878 --> 00:23:35,972
Yeah, he told me when I told
him I'd be his girlfriend.

357
00:23:36,014 --> 00:23:37,709
Kyle?

358
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:41,845
He's gonna have expectations.

359
00:23:41,887 --> 00:23:43,821
I know.

360
00:23:43,855 --> 00:23:46,323
I can't miss Bio again.

361
00:23:47,492 --> 00:23:49,323
I can.

362
00:23:49,361 --> 00:23:52,853
# I like to talk when I can
show you my affection #

363
00:23:54,499 --> 00:23:56,490
So who gets the room?

364
00:23:58,703 --> 00:24:00,796
Daniel, Mike.

365
00:24:02,707 --> 00:24:04,140
It's mine!

366
00:24:04,176 --> 00:24:06,508
No, it's mine! I'm older!

367
00:24:06,545 --> 00:24:07,569
I'm smarter.

368
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:08,874
Yeah, right, dumbo.

369
00:24:08,914 --> 00:24:10,939
You're dumbo, too.

370
00:24:10,982 --> 00:24:14,884
You're the most dumbo.

371
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:17,184
I knew if I asked you,
you'd say no.

372
00:24:23,695 --> 00:24:25,788
From Hollywood...

373
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:36,630
- inviting you to join Johnny
and his guests George Carlin...

374
00:24:36,675 --> 00:24:39,667
Lola Falana,
Charles Grant, and...

375
00:25:03,635 --> 00:25:06,604
Grace just got
into Kyle Rhodes' car.

376
00:25:06,638 --> 00:25:07,832
What?

377
00:25:13,745 --> 00:25:17,442
I said that Grace just
drove off in Kyle Rhodes' car.

378
00:25:19,084 --> 00:25:20,574
I can't do it.

379
00:25:20,619 --> 00:25:21,711
I can't do it
all by myself, Bryan.

380
00:25:21,753 --> 00:25:22,913
I need your help.

381
00:25:22,954 --> 00:25:24,444
I'm not asking you to.

382
00:25:24,489 --> 00:25:28,118
Yes, you are. You're asking
me to do it all alone.

383
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:29,456
What do you want me to do?

384
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:32,429
I don't know. I don't know.

385
00:25:32,464 --> 00:25:33,590
But we're here.
We're still here.

386
00:25:33,632 --> 00:25:35,896
You've got three children
who are still here.

387
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:59,221
# Born under the wrong sign #

388
00:26:00,425 --> 00:26:01,585
# Trouble is my middle name #

389
00:26:01,626 --> 00:26:03,526
Wow.

390
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:06,326
Your skin is so soft.

391
00:26:08,433 --> 00:26:11,197
So, uh, do you have
these freckle things everywhere?

392
00:26:14,506 --> 00:26:16,906
Where are you going?

393
00:26:21,713 --> 00:26:23,977
Gracie.
Gracie, what are you doing?

394
00:26:29,354 --> 00:26:30,787
What are you, crazy?

395
00:26:30,822 --> 00:26:32,813
Gracie, what are you doing?

396
00:26:36,861 --> 00:26:38,829
Your g's backwards.

397
00:26:38,863 --> 00:26:40,660
It's a "j."

398
00:26:40,699 --> 00:26:42,166
Who for?

399
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,963
Johnny.

400
00:26:44,002 --> 00:26:47,665
Ah. Yeah,
that's... That's really...

401
00:26:47,706 --> 00:26:49,139
That's really sweet.

402
00:26:51,843 --> 00:26:53,970
Car. Gracie.

403
00:27:06,891 --> 00:27:12,295
Kyle, do you really like me?

404
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:15,493
Yeah, yeah.

405
00:27:15,533 --> 00:27:17,160
I really do.

406
00:27:18,336 --> 00:27:20,566
You think a girl
could ever play soccer?

407
00:27:21,506 --> 00:27:24,066
That's a good one.

408
00:27:24,109 --> 00:27:25,838
Gracie.

409
00:27:27,078 --> 00:27:29,478
What is up with you?

410
00:27:33,752 --> 00:27:35,151
...White House window box.

411
00:28:03,048 --> 00:28:05,039
I am tough enough.

412
00:28:11,956 --> 00:28:15,756
WPLJ music specials feature
on Saturday night at ten...

413
00:28:15,794 --> 00:28:18,024
oh, my,
Paul McCartney and Wings...

414
00:28:18,063 --> 00:28:20,190
Sunday night at ten,
the Rolling Stones.

415
00:28:20,231 --> 00:28:22,199
There you go.
I'm Carroll Miller.

416
00:28:22,233 --> 00:28:23,564
It's always great music
for you right here...

417
00:28:23,601 --> 00:28:28,038
with Bruce Springsteen on WPLJ,
New York's top album station.

418
00:28:28,073 --> 00:28:31,975
# Well, I stood stone-like
at midnight #

419
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:35,446
# Suspended in my masquerade #

420
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:39,041
# And I combed my hair
till it was just right #

421
00:28:39,084 --> 00:28:42,713
# And commanded
the night brigade

422
00:28:42,754 --> 00:28:46,815
# I was open to pain
and crossed by the rain #

423
00:28:46,858 --> 00:28:49,759
# And I walked
on a crooked crutch #

424
00:28:49,794 --> 00:28:53,992
# I strolled all alone
through a fallout zone #

425
00:28:54,032 --> 00:28:57,490
# And came out
with my soul untouched #

426
00:28:57,535 --> 00:29:00,936
# I hid in the clouded wrath
of the crowd #

427
00:29:00,972 --> 00:29:03,236
# When they said, "Sit down,"
I stood up #

428
00:29:03,274 --> 00:29:05,242
Hey, Gracie.

429
00:29:05,276 --> 00:29:06,868
# Ooh-ooh #

430
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:08,811
I'm not gonna wait forever.

431
00:29:08,847 --> 00:29:13,181
# Growin' up #

432
00:29:13,218 --> 00:29:14,242
When?

433
00:29:15,787 --> 00:29:19,018
# And the flag of piracy
flew from my mast #

434
00:29:19,057 --> 00:29:22,754
# My sails were set
wing to wing #

435
00:29:22,794 --> 00:29:26,696
# I had a jukebox graduate
for first mate #

436
00:29:26,731 --> 00:29:30,360
# She couldn't sail,
but she sure could sing #

437
00:29:30,401 --> 00:29:33,768
# And I pushed B-52
and bombed 'em with the blues #

438
00:29:33,805 --> 00:29:37,502
# With my gear set stubborn
on standing #

439
00:29:37,542 --> 00:29:41,137
# I broke all the rules,
strafed my old high school #

440
00:29:41,179 --> 00:29:44,478
# Never once
gave thought to landing #

441
00:29:44,516 --> 00:29:47,349
The weight room
doesn't open till eight.

442
00:29:47,385 --> 00:29:50,013
It's for boys only.

443
00:29:50,054 --> 00:29:53,854
Are these written policies
or just common practice?

444
00:29:56,761 --> 00:29:58,752
The girls' gym
doesn't have any weights.

445
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:01,061
I can be here early
and nobody would even know.

446
00:30:01,099 --> 00:30:02,157
I'd know.

447
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,895
Is that such a burden?

448
00:30:03,935 --> 00:30:06,267
I can't break rules for you.

449
00:30:08,206 --> 00:30:09,537
Fine.

450
00:30:09,574 --> 00:30:12,509
# But my feet they finally
took root in the earth #

451
00:30:12,544 --> 00:30:16,480
# But I got me a nice
little place in the stars #

452
00:30:16,514 --> 00:30:20,644
# And I swear I found the key
to the universe #

453
00:30:20,685 --> 00:30:24,086
# In the engine
of an old parked car #

454
00:30:24,122 --> 00:30:27,558
# I hid in the mother breast
of the crowd #

455
00:30:27,592 --> 00:30:31,892
# When they said, "Pull down,"
I pulled up #

456
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:35,457
# Ooh-ooh #

457
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:38,958
# Growin' up #

458
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:42,734
# Ooh-ooh #

459
00:30:42,774 --> 00:30:46,505
# Growin' up #

460
00:30:46,544 --> 00:30:48,444
- Hey.
- Hey, yourself.

461
00:30:48,479 --> 00:30:51,073
I so dig this music,
don't you?

462
00:30:54,152 --> 00:30:55,676
I'm burning
to ask you something.

463
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:58,018
- What's that?
- Don't you ever get a break?

464
00:30:58,056 --> 00:31:00,923
Working the door.

465
00:31:00,959 --> 00:31:02,756
'Cause if you did...

466
00:31:02,794 --> 00:31:05,456
I was thinking
that maybe we could dance.

467
00:31:06,998 --> 00:31:09,023
You got an I.D?

468
00:31:09,067 --> 00:31:10,261
No.

469
00:31:11,436 --> 00:31:13,961
Go on.

470
00:31:14,005 --> 00:31:17,463
# Baby, baby,
let's get together #

471
00:31:17,508 --> 00:31:18,736
# Party hearty #

472
00:31:18,776 --> 00:31:20,641
Where did you
learn to do that?

473
00:31:20,678 --> 00:31:22,646
From you.

474
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,807
Kyle's here.
You didn't tell me.

475
00:31:24,849 --> 00:31:26,407
I didn't know.

476
00:31:26,451 --> 00:31:27,816
Liar.

477
00:31:27,852 --> 00:31:29,911
# That we like to do #

478
00:31:29,954 --> 00:31:32,923
# Aw, do a little dance #

479
00:31:32,957 --> 00:31:36,688
# Make a little love,
get down tonight #

480
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:39,891
Hey, you showed.

481
00:31:39,931 --> 00:31:43,594
# Do a little dance,
make a little love #

482
00:31:43,635 --> 00:31:45,660
# Get down tonight #

483
00:31:45,703 --> 00:31:47,671
# Get down tonight, baby #

484
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:09,359
So are we gonna do this?

485
00:32:23,741 --> 00:32:25,538
Let's do this.

486
00:32:29,914 --> 00:32:32,212
Just relax.

487
00:32:33,084 --> 00:32:34,676
Stop.

488
00:32:34,719 --> 00:32:36,949
Hey, you're the one
who brought me out here.

489
00:32:36,988 --> 00:32:38,615
I mean,
look what you're wearing.

490
00:32:41,893 --> 00:32:43,190
Stop.

491
00:32:47,165 --> 00:32:50,498
Hey. I told you
a Bowen can't go all the way.

492
00:32:53,371 --> 00:32:55,100
You're way out
of your league, sweetheart.

493
00:32:56,174 --> 00:32:58,642
You owe me 20 bucks, Curt.

494
00:32:58,676 --> 00:33:01,110
Yeah, whatever.

495
00:33:03,581 --> 00:33:05,446
Oh, my God.

496
00:33:14,459 --> 00:33:16,586
Bryan.

497
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:22,199
Did anyone tell you
why we're here?

498
00:33:23,434 --> 00:33:25,368
Mr. Bowen? Lindsay.

499
00:33:25,403 --> 00:33:28,895
Your daughter Grace,
on her last History exam...

500
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:31,704
copied word for word
from Jena Walpen's paper.

501
00:33:31,743 --> 00:33:33,768
I hated to do it,
but I had to fail her.

502
00:33:33,811 --> 00:33:35,779
Both girls are on probation.

503
00:33:39,484 --> 00:33:41,213
Goal! Goal!

504
00:33:41,252 --> 00:33:43,777
Why is Peter here?

505
00:33:43,821 --> 00:33:46,722
I think the boys wanted
someone to practice with.

506
00:33:46,758 --> 00:33:50,091
Oh, yeah!
Yes! Oh! Yes!

507
00:33:50,128 --> 00:33:53,097
Would you like to go
with me on Saturday?

508
00:33:53,131 --> 00:33:54,155
I thought
we could get you a trim...

509
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:55,392
get the hair off your face.

510
00:33:55,433 --> 00:33:56,957
I like my hair.

511
00:33:58,436 --> 00:34:01,030
But, honey,
nobody can see you.

512
00:34:01,072 --> 00:34:03,302
We could go to the mall
and get you some new tops.

513
00:34:03,341 --> 00:34:05,366
I don't like the clothes
they have there.

514
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:07,241
Okay. Anything you want.
You choose.

515
00:34:07,278 --> 00:34:10,213
Honey, what is going on?

516
00:34:10,248 --> 00:34:11,909
I'm just busy.

517
00:34:11,949 --> 00:34:15,510
Well, with what?
A boy? Kyle?

518
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:16,815
Just things, you know.

519
00:34:16,854 --> 00:34:18,947
I don't know.
That's why I'm asking.

520
00:34:19,824 --> 00:34:23,021
We saw
Principal Enright today.

521
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:25,621
Grace, you flunked History.

522
00:34:25,663 --> 00:34:27,130
So what, I'm grounded?

523
00:34:27,165 --> 00:34:29,360
Uh, sh... well...
Uh, I didn't say that.

524
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:34,997
Well, not yet anyway.

525
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:36,939
Well, let me know when
you decide on something.

526
00:34:47,452 --> 00:34:48,919
What's going on?

527
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:51,612
Do I have to check
your homework every night?

528
00:34:51,656 --> 00:34:53,248
Good boy.

529
00:34:53,291 --> 00:34:55,725
If you're gonna act like a kid,
that's how I'll treat you.

530
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:00,564
Show me your homework.

531
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:02,623
- Didn't do it.
- Do it now.

532
00:35:02,667 --> 00:35:04,532
Can't.
Didn't bring my books home.

533
00:35:10,308 --> 00:35:12,674
You're grounded.
Come straight home from school.

534
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:14,541
And if your grades
don't come up, summer school.

535
00:35:18,649 --> 00:35:20,514
I want to do something
I've never done before.

536
00:35:20,551 --> 00:35:21,540
Really?

537
00:35:21,586 --> 00:35:23,417
Something you've
never done before.

538
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:24,887
I can think of a few things.

539
00:35:24,922 --> 00:35:26,981
I want to do 'em all at once,
right now.

540
00:35:30,161 --> 00:35:31,423
Come on. Go.

541
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:32,895
Come on.

542
00:35:34,398 --> 00:35:35,831
You got a license?

543
00:35:35,867 --> 00:35:37,562
Yeah.
Right here. My mom's.

544
00:35:37,602 --> 00:35:39,627
Let's go. Come on.

545
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:41,262
Shh! Shh!

546
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:42,738
Right here. Come on.

547
00:35:44,342 --> 00:35:46,776
Bye, boys.

548
00:35:51,516 --> 00:35:56,010
# I don't want
to know your name #

549
00:35:57,355 --> 00:36:00,791
# 'Cause you don't
look the same #

550
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:06,559
# The way you did before #

551
00:36:06,597 --> 00:36:08,895
# Fox on the run #

552
00:36:08,933 --> 00:36:10,161
# You scream #

553
00:36:10,201 --> 00:36:14,262
# And everybody comes
a-running #

554
00:36:14,305 --> 00:36:19,242
# Take a run
and hide yourself away #

555
00:36:50,074 --> 00:36:52,065
Enough sun.
Let's go to the club.

556
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:57,204
# Once I had a love,
and it was a gas #

557
00:36:57,248 --> 00:36:58,715
# Soon turned out #

558
00:36:58,749 --> 00:37:00,273
What college you go to?

559
00:37:00,318 --> 00:37:01,751
Up in Boston.

560
00:37:01,786 --> 00:37:03,014
Oh, cool. Which one?

561
00:37:04,622 --> 00:37:07,284
I want to go dance.
You want to come dance with me?

562
00:37:11,596 --> 00:37:14,394
All right.

563
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:19,597
# Once I had a love,
and it was divine #

564
00:37:19,637 --> 00:37:21,901
He majors in astrology
so he can read girls' hands.

565
00:37:21,939 --> 00:37:24,237
Like, you know, like...

566
00:37:24,275 --> 00:37:26,709
# Seemed like the real thing,
but I was so blind #

567
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:28,302
Like this is
your love line.

568
00:37:28,346 --> 00:37:30,678
It goes all the way up and...

569
00:37:30,715 --> 00:37:32,842
I'll be right back.

570
00:37:32,883 --> 00:37:35,443
Okay.

571
00:37:35,486 --> 00:37:38,944
# In between
what I find is pleasing #

572
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:41,356
# And I'm feeling fine #

573
00:37:41,392 --> 00:37:42,984
# Love is so confusing #

574
00:37:43,027 --> 00:37:47,487
# There's no peace of mind
if I fear I'm losing you #

575
00:37:47,531 --> 00:37:51,524
# It's just no good
you teasing like you do #

576
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:55,004
# Ooh-ooh, oh-oh #

577
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:59,334
# Ooh-ooh, oh-oh #

578
00:38:01,812 --> 00:38:03,074
So you're from Beantown?

579
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:04,979
Yeah. Yeah.

580
00:38:05,016 --> 00:38:07,382
I've been there a lot actually.
I go to college there.

581
00:38:07,418 --> 00:38:09,147
Oh, yeah? Which one?

582
00:38:09,186 --> 00:38:11,620
BBC.

583
00:38:13,157 --> 00:38:14,681
BBC?

584
00:38:14,725 --> 00:38:15,817
Mm-hmm.

585
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:17,521
Yeah. How old are you?

586
00:38:17,561 --> 00:38:18,687
I'm old enough.

587
00:38:20,164 --> 00:38:22,132
Yeah. I don't... I don't
think this is a good idea.

588
00:38:22,166 --> 00:38:23,224
Let's go back.

589
00:38:24,735 --> 00:38:26,999
No. Come on.

590
00:38:28,773 --> 00:38:30,104
I have a car.

591
00:38:31,175 --> 00:38:34,474
# Ooh-hoo, Jackie Blue #

592
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:39,316
# Making wishes
that never come true #

593
00:38:40,584 --> 00:38:43,815
# Going places
where you've never been #

594
00:38:45,022 --> 00:38:48,355
# Ooh, Jackie,
you're going again #

595
00:38:51,295 --> 00:38:53,923
Come on, baby.

596
00:38:53,964 --> 00:38:56,194
- What was that?
- Nothing.

597
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:02,097
Gracie. Gracie.

598
00:39:02,139 --> 00:39:03,936
- Oh, shit.
- Gracie, get out of the car.

599
00:39:03,974 --> 00:39:04,963
Who's that?

600
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:06,169
Out, out. Get out.

601
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:07,541
Where's my shirt?

602
00:39:07,578 --> 00:39:08,670
Come on, punk.
Get packing.

603
00:39:12,983 --> 00:39:15,918
Gracie, come on out.
Right now.

604
00:39:17,922 --> 00:39:19,412
Gracie, you all right?

605
00:39:19,457 --> 00:39:21,049
Oh, yeah. She's fine.

606
00:39:21,092 --> 00:39:22,320
I owe you one, Sal.

607
00:39:24,695 --> 00:39:26,060
You can stop
acting like you care.

608
00:39:26,097 --> 00:39:27,792
Nobody can see you.

609
00:39:27,832 --> 00:39:30,232
You're just lucky
you didn't get hurt.

610
00:39:30,267 --> 00:39:32,292
Gracie, what the hell
were you thinking?

611
00:39:32,336 --> 00:39:34,429
Do you really want to have
this conversation?

612
00:39:35,606 --> 00:39:37,096
I do.

613
00:39:37,141 --> 00:39:39,405
Then talk.

614
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:53,884
Come on, Dad.

615
00:40:38,302 --> 00:40:39,860
Gracie, get up. Come on.
Get dressed.

616
00:40:41,906 --> 00:40:44,272
Two feet on the floor.
Let's go.

617
00:40:45,676 --> 00:40:46,734
Dad.

618
00:40:48,712 --> 00:40:50,339
Don't make me get the ice water.

619
00:40:50,381 --> 00:40:51,405
Go away.

620
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:54,179
You want to talk?
This is me talking.

621
00:41:01,725 --> 00:41:04,125
I can't do anything
about the weight room.

622
00:41:04,161 --> 00:41:06,425
Grace wants to play
varsity soccer.

623
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:08,227
That's terrific.

624
00:41:08,265 --> 00:41:11,098
Really great, but Columbia
doesn't have a girls' team.

625
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:12,727
That's why she's trying out
for the boys' team.

626
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:14,863
- No, I'm not.
- Grace.

627
00:41:14,905 --> 00:41:16,566
You can't play a girl
on a boys' team.

628
00:41:16,607 --> 00:41:17,767
There's no law against it.

629
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:20,868
There's no law for it.
She could get injured.

630
00:41:20,911 --> 00:41:22,071
So what?

631
00:41:22,112 --> 00:41:23,340
Look.

632
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:25,746
I'm not risking the success
of my team for one girl.

633
00:41:25,783 --> 00:41:27,546
I've got the team this year
to win the whole thing.

634
00:41:27,585 --> 00:41:29,883
Well, maybe she can
help you do it.

635
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,478
Have you seen her play?

636
00:41:31,522 --> 00:41:33,149
Coach, we're not asking
for any special treatment.

637
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:35,681
Just a tryout. She can
either do it or she can't.

638
00:41:35,726 --> 00:41:39,594
It's not my call. Take it up
with the school board.

639
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:40,619
What the hell was that?

640
00:41:40,664 --> 00:41:42,495
You wanted to play,
let's petition the board.

641
00:41:42,533 --> 00:41:43,557
Like you care.

642
00:41:43,601 --> 00:41:44,590
You take summer school
in the morning...

643
00:41:44,635 --> 00:41:45,761
train with me
in the afternoon.

644
00:41:45,803 --> 00:41:47,168
Tryouts are in two months,
you know.

645
00:41:47,204 --> 00:41:49,695
Why now?

646
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:51,207
Where were you
when I was begging you?

647
00:41:51,242 --> 00:41:53,608
Where have you been
my entire freakin' life?

648
00:41:53,644 --> 00:41:55,236
Everything's always been
about Johnny, about your boys.

649
00:41:55,279 --> 00:41:58,407
You don't even care about me
because I'm not one of 'em.

650
00:41:58,449 --> 00:42:00,542
- Oh, come on, Gracie.
- Shut up!

651
00:42:00,584 --> 00:42:02,211
Hey, you can't talk
to me like that.

652
00:42:02,253 --> 00:42:03,584
Listen, you think anybody
got better on their own?

653
00:42:03,621 --> 00:42:04,918
I coached Johnny.

654
00:42:04,955 --> 00:42:06,217
Johnny was a natural.

655
00:42:06,257 --> 00:42:07,485
Johnny was a boy!

656
00:42:14,331 --> 00:42:16,663
You know, I never had
anybody care about me.

657
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:20,261
Nobody ever gave me
their damn time.

658
00:42:20,304 --> 00:42:22,795
My knee's killing me.

659
00:42:30,314 --> 00:42:33,875
Grace, I don't know if
you are good enough, but...

660
00:42:35,819 --> 00:42:38,117
let me help you.

661
00:43:30,207 --> 00:43:32,334
Here.
The school board letter.

662
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:34,635
You write this?

663
00:43:34,678 --> 00:43:35,838
Yeah. You sign it, too.

664
00:43:37,214 --> 00:43:39,842
The sooner we mail it,
the sooner they say yes.

665
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:42,809
Those boys are gonna
try and take you out.

666
00:43:42,853 --> 00:43:44,650
They're gonna go after you.

667
00:43:44,688 --> 00:43:47,452
So I'll teach you how to
take it, how to give it back.

668
00:43:47,491 --> 00:43:49,152
It's mental
as much as it is physical.

669
00:43:50,361 --> 00:43:53,353
First, we work on speed,
toughness...

670
00:43:53,397 --> 00:43:55,422
then we work with the ball.

671
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:56,956
You want to do this?

672
00:43:58,836 --> 00:44:00,827
Let's go.

673
00:44:02,806 --> 00:44:05,036
- Tired?
- No.

674
00:44:05,075 --> 00:44:06,440
'Cause if you want
to take a break.

675
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:07,967
- No. You?
- You seem a little sluggish.

676
00:44:08,012 --> 00:44:10,344
I'm just taking it easy on you.

677
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:14,614
Gracie.

678
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:20,722
Dad.

679
00:44:30,401 --> 00:44:31,868
Not done.

680
00:44:33,203 --> 00:44:35,694
Really fast speed now.
Double up. That's it.

681
00:44:35,739 --> 00:44:38,230
That's it.
Get your knees up.

682
00:44:39,543 --> 00:44:42,171
Dad's training her
for the boys' team.

683
00:44:44,915 --> 00:44:46,280
They're both delusional.

684
00:44:46,316 --> 00:44:49,217
Go, go, go, go.
Faster feet. Like this.

685
00:45:02,733 --> 00:45:05,031
My God,
I think I'm gonna puke.

686
00:45:05,069 --> 00:45:07,469
So puke.

687
00:45:07,504 --> 00:45:09,699
Finish your suicides.
You owe me four more.

688
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:12,706
You jerk.

689
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:18,341
Hundred and fifty dollars.

690
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:21,476
You know, your paychecks haven't
been going into the account.

691
00:45:21,518 --> 00:45:23,782
Have you been cashing them?

692
00:45:27,324 --> 00:45:29,019
I quit my job.

693
00:45:30,794 --> 00:45:32,625
What?

694
00:45:34,465 --> 00:45:37,059
You didn't even
talk to me about it?

695
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:41,466
Where have you been going?

696
00:45:41,505 --> 00:45:43,496
I just couldn't tell you.

697
00:45:45,976 --> 00:45:47,944
Something will turn up.

698
00:45:47,978 --> 00:45:49,809
What are we gonna live on?

699
00:45:51,048 --> 00:45:52,709
I'm not gonna lose
another child.

700
00:45:54,284 --> 00:45:56,684
Forty-seven.

701
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:58,881
Forty-eight.

702
00:45:58,922 --> 00:46:00,549
Forty-nine.

703
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:01,956
All right. Chin-up.

704
00:46:01,992 --> 00:46:03,857
- What?
- Let's go.

705
00:46:07,097 --> 00:46:08,894
All right, give me ten.

706
00:46:08,932 --> 00:46:10,422
Did Johnny do ten?

707
00:46:10,467 --> 00:46:11,695
At least. Let's go.

708
00:46:15,005 --> 00:46:17,064
One.

709
00:46:19,877 --> 00:46:21,469
Two.

710
00:46:21,512 --> 00:46:24,606
Check the pot pie
in about twenty minutes.

711
00:46:24,648 --> 00:46:26,775
Where are you going, Mom?

712
00:46:26,817 --> 00:46:28,182
My other job.

713
00:46:28,218 --> 00:46:30,345
Ask your father.

714
00:46:33,657 --> 00:46:35,124
'Cause I'm not working...

715
00:46:35,159 --> 00:46:38,856
she picked up a couple
extra shifts at the hospital.

716
00:46:39,997 --> 00:46:41,931
Let's go.

717
00:46:41,965 --> 00:46:43,489
Come on.

718
00:46:46,069 --> 00:46:47,764
Here's the itinerary.

719
00:46:49,173 --> 00:46:50,640
We get to this club...

720
00:46:50,674 --> 00:46:52,232
that's having
this battle of the bands, right?

721
00:46:52,276 --> 00:46:54,039
It's gonna be amazing.

722
00:46:54,077 --> 00:46:55,339
You're gonna love it.

723
00:46:55,379 --> 00:46:56,937
But, Jena,
it is a school night.

724
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:58,208
It's the summer.

725
00:46:58,248 --> 00:47:01,149
I have summer session,
plus I'm training.

726
00:47:01,185 --> 00:47:03,346
People are talking.

727
00:47:03,387 --> 00:47:05,548
You're committing
social suicide.

728
00:47:05,589 --> 00:47:06,783
I don't care.

729
00:47:06,824 --> 00:47:08,257
Hold my feet.

730
00:47:08,292 --> 00:47:13,286
Gracie, you've always had
your athletic interests.

731
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:14,627
But come on...

732
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:19,568
girls who play sports at our age
are considered lesbos.

733
00:47:21,071 --> 00:47:22,561
I can like boys and sports.

734
00:47:22,606 --> 00:47:24,631
I know that,
and you know that...

735
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:29,009
but that's not how they see it.

736
00:47:30,147 --> 00:47:31,774
They or you?

737
00:47:33,083 --> 00:47:34,607
Well, if they think
you're a dyke...

738
00:47:34,651 --> 00:47:37,449
then I am, too,
by association.

739
00:47:37,487 --> 00:47:39,114
Well, then, don't associate.

740
00:47:40,557 --> 00:47:43,526
Fine. You know what?
Maybe you are a lesbo.

741
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:45,118
You were just
the last one to know.

742
00:47:46,496 --> 00:47:49,226
And that bird's too freaking big
for that cage, by the way.

743
00:47:51,335 --> 00:47:52,597
Come here.

744
00:47:52,636 --> 00:47:54,263
What?

745
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:58,032
I'm gonna toss this little guy.
Catch and cradle it.

746
00:47:58,075 --> 00:48:00,805
- Don't let it break.
- Okay.

747
00:48:00,844 --> 00:48:02,869
With your foot.

748
00:48:02,913 --> 00:48:04,676
With my foot?

749
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:05,977
Watch.

750
00:48:08,652 --> 00:48:10,677
Soft as a pillow.

751
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:12,780
Ooh, ooh, ooh.
Here you go. Ready?

752
00:48:14,791 --> 00:48:16,486
You try.

753
00:48:22,766 --> 00:48:23,790
Oh.

754
00:48:26,970 --> 00:48:28,904
Just cradle it.

755
00:48:30,641 --> 00:48:33,542
Okay, here. You try.

756
00:48:37,114 --> 00:48:39,708
So boys' varsity team...

757
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:41,240
think I can do it?

758
00:48:41,285 --> 00:48:42,912
Try out or make the team?

759
00:48:42,953 --> 00:48:45,183
The boys are just...

760
00:48:45,222 --> 00:48:46,780
Worried about all of them
or just one?

761
00:48:49,626 --> 00:48:52,220
Kyle's a jerk.

762
00:48:52,262 --> 00:48:54,492
If you want to
play with boys...

763
00:48:54,531 --> 00:48:56,158
you're gonna have to start
training with them.

764
00:49:00,837 --> 00:49:04,102
# Tonight there's gonna be
a jailbreak #

765
00:49:04,141 --> 00:49:07,577
# Somewhere in this town #

766
00:49:07,611 --> 00:49:10,978
# See, me and the boys
we don't like it #

767
00:49:11,014 --> 00:49:14,677
# So we're getting up
and going down #

768
00:49:14,718 --> 00:49:18,279
# Hiding low,
looking right to left #

769
00:49:18,322 --> 00:49:22,088
# If you see us coming,
I think it's best to move away #

770
00:49:22,125 --> 00:49:27,529
# Do you hear what I say
from under my breath? #

771
00:49:27,564 --> 00:49:30,863
# Tonight there's
gonna be a jailbreak #

772
00:49:30,901 --> 00:49:33,096
Hey, Gracie.
Did you see that, huh?

773
00:49:33,136 --> 00:49:37,004
That's how you do it,
unless you did.

774
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:39,338
All right,
set it up again, boys.

775
00:49:39,376 --> 00:49:42,174
Okay.

776
00:49:42,212 --> 00:49:46,512
Hey, if you're going, go.
Forget Kyle.

777
00:49:51,788 --> 00:49:53,312
Gracie's gonna play.

778
00:49:56,293 --> 00:49:58,693
- All right. You take it.
- All right.

779
00:49:58,729 --> 00:49:59,923
Yeah.

780
00:49:59,963 --> 00:50:01,726
Curt, step out for a second.
Donny, Scott.

781
00:50:01,765 --> 00:50:03,630
Craig, step back.

782
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:05,498
No, no, no, no.

783
00:50:05,535 --> 00:50:06,627
Let Gracie take it.

784
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:07,932
Yeah.

785
00:50:07,971 --> 00:50:09,233
You gotta have some
natural talent in there, right?

786
00:50:09,272 --> 00:50:10,739
Yeah, come on, Gracie.
Show us what you got.

787
00:50:10,774 --> 00:50:12,401
She is a Bowen.

788
00:50:12,442 --> 00:50:13,773
Oh, oh, oh.

789
00:50:13,810 --> 00:50:15,641
Oh, come on.

790
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:18,614
- Yeah, she got you beat, man.
- You can, Gracie.

791
00:50:18,648 --> 00:50:21,048
Come on, Gracie.

792
00:50:21,084 --> 00:50:23,052
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

793
00:50:27,124 --> 00:50:29,058
There you go.

794
00:50:29,092 --> 00:50:30,889
You gotta be quicker, Gracie.

795
00:50:30,927 --> 00:50:32,121
Man, that's all right.

796
00:50:32,162 --> 00:50:34,153
Ooh hoo hoo hoo!

797
00:50:37,034 --> 00:50:39,559
Yeah, yeah.
You gotta be good.

798
00:50:39,603 --> 00:50:42,401
Hey, Donny.
Show her your moves.

799
00:50:42,439 --> 00:50:43,531
Boogie-woogie. Boogie.

800
00:50:47,310 --> 00:50:49,175
Come on. Come on.

801
00:50:49,212 --> 00:50:50,611
Here it is. You comin'?

802
00:50:50,647 --> 00:50:52,046
Here it is!

803
00:50:52,082 --> 00:50:53,174
Take it, come on.

804
00:50:53,784 --> 00:50:54,773
Boo.

805
00:50:54,818 --> 00:50:56,615
You want the ball?
Go get it.

806
00:50:59,723 --> 00:51:00,781
Whoo.

807
00:51:00,824 --> 00:51:03,520
Oh, oh, oh.

808
00:51:06,563 --> 00:51:07,552
Gracie.

809
00:51:07,597 --> 00:51:09,565
What the hell are you doing?

810
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:10,861
It wasn't hard.

811
00:51:12,002 --> 00:51:15,096
- You all right?
- Gracie, don't go.

812
00:51:17,174 --> 00:51:18,937
Is that all she's got?

813
00:51:18,975 --> 00:51:20,840
Bye-bye, Gracie.

814
00:51:24,381 --> 00:51:25,541
Watch it.

815
00:51:27,217 --> 00:51:28,844
I'm ready
for my real training.

816
00:51:28,885 --> 00:51:30,182
Oh, you think you're ready?

817
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:32,518
With the ball.

818
00:51:32,556 --> 00:51:34,490
I don't want to just
barely survive out there.

819
00:51:34,524 --> 00:51:36,992
I want you to train me
like you did Johnny.

820
00:51:38,728 --> 00:51:40,161
If you want to
compete, Gracie...

821
00:51:40,197 --> 00:51:42,290
- Yeah?
- You gotta win the ball.

822
00:51:42,332 --> 00:51:45,824
You gotta take position.
Ready? Get the ball.

823
00:51:45,869 --> 00:51:48,030
Go, go, go, go.
Peter. Peter.

824
00:51:48,071 --> 00:51:49,231
You're not
helping anybody.

825
00:51:49,272 --> 00:51:50,899
What did he do?

826
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:52,101
He let you get the ball.

827
00:51:52,142 --> 00:51:53,268
- All right?
- No, he didn't.

828
00:51:53,310 --> 00:51:55,175
Don't do that.
You get it, all right?

829
00:51:55,212 --> 00:51:56,736
Just so much...
Be aggressive, tougher.

830
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:58,805
You gotta want and believe
that you can take the ball.

831
00:51:58,849 --> 00:52:00,248
Go, go, go.

832
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:04,280
Did you hear me?

833
00:52:04,321 --> 00:52:05,811
You gotta get your body
in front of his.

834
00:52:05,856 --> 00:52:07,721
Just like that, all right?
Help me out here.

835
00:52:07,757 --> 00:52:08,849
You played with Johnny,
right?

836
00:52:08,892 --> 00:52:11,156
- We goofed around.
- You did drills.

837
00:52:11,194 --> 00:52:12,593
We didn't really
call them that.

838
00:52:12,629 --> 00:52:14,290
Gracie.

839
00:52:14,331 --> 00:52:15,525
How did you teach Johnny?

840
00:52:15,565 --> 00:52:17,999
I didn't.
He was a natural, remember?

841
00:52:28,411 --> 00:52:30,572
Wow. Is that Johnny?

842
00:52:30,614 --> 00:52:32,104
That's me.

843
00:52:32,149 --> 00:52:33,377
You guys had
the same number?

844
00:52:33,416 --> 00:52:34,781
Yeah, number seven,
both of us.

845
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:40,112
It's junior year.
You saw this before, Grace.

846
00:52:40,157 --> 00:52:41,749
Never.

847
00:52:41,791 --> 00:52:43,759
That was before
I hurt my knee.

848
00:52:43,793 --> 00:52:47,422
Oh, oh, wait. Wait.
You gotta watch this move.

849
00:52:49,633 --> 00:52:51,123
- Ooh.
- Whoa.

850
00:52:51,168 --> 00:52:53,102
Smoked him.

851
00:52:53,136 --> 00:52:54,125
Baff. Right there.

852
00:52:54,171 --> 00:52:56,571
- Oh!
- Smoked that guy.

853
00:52:56,606 --> 00:52:58,233
You were like a star.

854
00:52:58,275 --> 00:52:59,640
Well, not so much.

855
00:53:00,844 --> 00:53:02,971
Didn't have anybody
looking out for me.

856
00:53:03,013 --> 00:53:04,571
What about Granddad?

857
00:53:04,614 --> 00:53:07,344
What about him?

858
00:53:08,552 --> 00:53:10,281
He never saw anything in me.

859
00:53:22,799 --> 00:53:24,130
This is what I used to do.
Simple move.

860
00:53:24,167 --> 00:53:25,429
You just wait for the guy's
weight to shift...

861
00:53:25,468 --> 00:53:26,901
and then cut the ball.
Simple like this.

862
00:53:26,937 --> 00:53:28,700
Come on.
Come on. Come on. Right?

863
00:53:28,738 --> 00:53:30,433
Bam. Baff.

864
00:53:30,473 --> 00:53:31,497
I'm gonna try
and take it from you.

865
00:53:31,541 --> 00:53:33,202
If the angle's not sharp enough,
I'm gonna take it.

866
00:53:33,243 --> 00:53:34,972
Just look at what I do
and do it.

867
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:40,346
No, no, Grace. No.
Now, try this. Ready?

868
00:53:40,383 --> 00:53:42,078
- Are you paying attention?
- Yeah.

869
00:53:42,118 --> 00:53:43,551
Good. You gotta get it.
Watch this.

870
00:53:43,587 --> 00:53:45,282
Like that. Block, and over.

871
00:53:45,322 --> 00:53:46,516
Baff. Goal.

872
00:53:46,556 --> 00:53:48,490
Come on.

873
00:53:48,525 --> 00:53:50,390
You see what I did, right?

874
00:53:53,163 --> 00:53:54,357
Come on, Grace.

875
00:53:54,397 --> 00:53:56,957
One last time,
I'll show you. Ready?

876
00:53:58,335 --> 00:54:00,599
Baff. Goal.

877
00:54:00,637 --> 00:54:02,798
Kingston, October 23rd.

878
00:54:02,839 --> 00:54:04,500
I think it's time to stop.

879
00:54:04,541 --> 00:54:06,372
We got a couple more minutes.

880
00:54:06,409 --> 00:54:08,502
I think
it's too much for her.

881
00:54:08,545 --> 00:54:09,910
Too much for her?

882
00:54:09,946 --> 00:54:11,743
Does it look like
it's too much for her, huh?

883
00:54:12,949 --> 00:54:16,009
One, two...

884
00:54:16,052 --> 00:54:17,576
three...

885
00:54:17,621 --> 00:54:19,452
four...

886
00:54:19,489 --> 00:54:20,683
five.

887
00:54:20,724 --> 00:54:24,091
Carp, carp, shift.

888
00:54:24,127 --> 00:54:25,389
Carp, carp, shift.

889
00:54:29,899 --> 00:54:30,991
# Rock steady, baby #

890
00:54:31,034 --> 00:54:32,228
Stretch it! Stretch it!

891
00:54:32,269 --> 00:54:34,897
Stretch!

892
00:54:34,938 --> 00:54:35,927
# Let's call this song #

893
00:54:35,972 --> 00:54:38,964
Yeah! Yeah! Goal!

894
00:54:39,009 --> 00:54:39,998
Whoo-hoo!

895
00:54:40,043 --> 00:54:41,169
# Step n' move your hips
with a feelin' #

896
00:54:41,211 --> 00:54:43,873
# From side to side #

897
00:54:43,913 --> 00:54:46,143
# Sit yourself down
in your car #

898
00:54:46,182 --> 00:54:48,650
# And take a ride,
and while you're movin' #

899
00:54:48,685 --> 00:54:52,121
# Rock steady,
rock steady, baby #

900
00:54:53,256 --> 00:54:56,282
# Let's call this song
exactly what it is #

901
00:54:56,326 --> 00:54:57,350
# What it is,
what it is, what it is #

902
00:54:57,394 --> 00:54:58,588
Come on, Grace.
Quicker, quicker.

903
00:54:58,628 --> 00:55:00,789
# And, Lord, I feel it #

904
00:55:00,830 --> 00:55:02,024
# Come dance around #

905
00:55:02,065 --> 00:55:04,761
# What it is
'cause I might be doin' #

906
00:55:04,801 --> 00:55:06,928
# This funky dance
all night, oh #

907
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:09,530
Three, four, five.

908
00:55:09,572 --> 00:55:12,973
Three, four, five.

909
00:55:13,009 --> 00:55:15,773
One, two, three.

910
00:55:15,812 --> 00:55:17,803
One, two...

911
00:55:17,847 --> 00:55:21,749
Six... come on... seven, eight.

912
00:55:22,986 --> 00:55:25,216
Strike it.

913
00:55:25,789 --> 00:55:28,155
Go. Strike it.

914
00:55:34,197 --> 00:55:36,256
# Rock #

915
00:55:36,299 --> 00:55:38,494
# Steady #

916
00:55:38,535 --> 00:55:40,799
# Rock #

917
00:55:40,837 --> 00:55:43,271
# Steady #

918
00:55:43,306 --> 00:55:45,501
# Rock #

919
00:55:45,542 --> 00:55:47,874
# Steady #

920
00:55:47,911 --> 00:55:49,970
# Rock #

921
00:55:50,013 --> 00:55:51,207
# Steady #

922
00:55:59,022 --> 00:56:00,922
Good. Good.

923
00:56:03,727 --> 00:56:05,752
You're doin' good, Grace.

924
00:56:21,144 --> 00:56:23,305
What?

925
00:56:23,346 --> 00:56:25,678
This came today
from the school board.

926
00:56:25,715 --> 00:56:27,239
Here, Mike.

927
00:56:29,152 --> 00:56:30,744
They're not
gonna let you play.

928
00:56:30,787 --> 00:56:33,017
What?

929
00:56:33,056 --> 00:56:35,320
No.

930
00:56:35,358 --> 00:56:37,349
No.

931
00:56:39,195 --> 00:56:40,628
How could they turn me down?

932
00:56:40,663 --> 00:56:44,190
Gracie, you're in great shape,
and if you want...

933
00:56:44,234 --> 00:56:45,258
Dad talked to Mr. C...

934
00:56:45,301 --> 00:56:46,996
and he said
you can play field hockey.

935
00:56:47,036 --> 00:56:49,129
Field hockey?

936
00:56:50,206 --> 00:56:53,698
You never thought
I was good enough.

937
00:56:53,743 --> 00:56:55,836
You didn't think
I could do this, did you?

938
00:57:00,383 --> 00:57:01,782
What?

939
00:57:01,818 --> 00:57:03,479
You went behind her back?

940
00:57:09,826 --> 00:57:10,884
My dad wants me
to play field hockey.

941
00:57:10,927 --> 00:57:13,088
This is unbelievable.

942
00:57:13,129 --> 00:57:15,029
Hey, Peter, you coming?

943
00:57:15,064 --> 00:57:17,055
We only got the field
for an hour.

944
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:18,590
I gotta go, Grace.

945
00:57:20,103 --> 00:57:22,162
Yeah, you better.

946
00:57:24,941 --> 00:57:26,203
I get it.

947
00:57:26,242 --> 00:57:27,903
You're hoping that Kyle's
gonna help you...

948
00:57:27,944 --> 00:57:29,309
get a spot on the team, right?

949
00:57:29,345 --> 00:57:31,745
And I was just there
to help improve your game.

950
00:57:31,781 --> 00:57:34,272
Peter, let's go.

951
00:57:42,525 --> 00:57:45,085
Shut up.

952
00:57:47,464 --> 00:57:49,022
Happy?

953
00:57:49,065 --> 00:57:50,999
This isn't you,
lying around here...

954
00:57:51,034 --> 00:57:52,763
when you could be fighting back.

955
00:57:52,802 --> 00:57:54,269
The tryouts are this Saturday.

956
00:57:54,304 --> 00:57:56,636
You don't want me to play.

957
00:57:56,673 --> 00:57:59,608
Yeah, that's true. I don't.

958
00:57:59,642 --> 00:58:01,132
That's not my choice.

959
00:58:03,246 --> 00:58:04,770
Do you know
what I wanted to be?

960
00:58:04,814 --> 00:58:06,679
What?

961
00:58:06,716 --> 00:58:08,513
I wanted to be a surgeon.

962
00:58:08,551 --> 00:58:09,540
You?

963
00:58:09,586 --> 00:58:10,746
Mm-hmm.

964
00:58:10,787 --> 00:58:13,950
I wanted to be
in the emergency room.

965
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:16,254
So now I'm a nurse.

966
00:58:16,292 --> 00:58:18,522
That's as close as I could get.

967
00:58:20,730 --> 00:58:23,927
So if you want to
limit yourself, that's fine.

968
00:58:23,967 --> 00:58:27,095
But don't let other people
do it for you.

969
00:58:36,446 --> 00:58:37,970
Excuse me.

970
00:58:38,014 --> 00:58:41,177
I'm here
to see a C. Bowsher.

971
00:58:41,217 --> 00:58:42,741
And you are?

972
00:58:42,785 --> 00:58:44,275
I really need to see him.

973
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:45,582
Her.

974
00:58:45,622 --> 00:58:47,453
I'm Connie Bowsher.

975
00:58:47,490 --> 00:58:49,685
Can we talk about this?

976
00:58:54,497 --> 00:58:55,987
Couldn't change their mind?

977
00:58:56,032 --> 00:58:57,897
I have to file an appeal
by tomorrow.

978
00:58:57,934 --> 00:59:00,869
- Need help?
- From you?

979
00:59:13,883 --> 00:59:14,907
Gracie.

980
00:59:19,589 --> 00:59:21,181
Gracie, come out.

981
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:45,514
Bowsher just called.

982
00:59:45,548 --> 00:59:47,345
The board's gonna hold
a hearing for her.

983
00:59:47,383 --> 00:59:49,146
Have you told her yet?

984
00:59:49,185 --> 00:59:51,312
I'm on my way.

985
00:59:51,354 --> 00:59:54,687
Bryan, is she good enough?

986
00:59:54,724 --> 00:59:57,386
If they let her play,
can she do it?

987
00:59:57,427 --> 01:00:00,123
Yeah. Sure.

988
01:00:00,163 --> 01:00:02,757
Well, if you don't
believe in her...

989
01:00:09,572 --> 01:00:13,941
And, finally, Title lx
of the federal mandate...

990
01:00:13,977 --> 01:00:17,037
requires equal access
to sports for girls.

991
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:19,571
Thank you.

992
01:00:19,616 --> 01:00:22,983
Coach Connors, tell us
what about Title lx?

993
01:00:23,019 --> 01:00:26,546
Title lx means there's money
for a girls' soccer team...

994
01:00:26,589 --> 01:00:27,817
but there's no interest.

995
01:00:27,857 --> 01:00:29,154
Why is that?

996
01:00:29,192 --> 01:00:31,387
Soccer's not considered
a girls' sport.

997
01:00:31,427 --> 01:00:34,123
The girls I know would rather
watch it than play it.

998
01:00:34,163 --> 01:00:36,723
We offer girls' gymnastics...

999
01:00:36,766 --> 01:00:41,601
field hockey, badminton,
tennis, swimming, softball.

1000
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:43,333
Any one of them could use
a skilled athlete...

1001
01:00:43,373 --> 01:00:44,601
like Miss Bowen.

1002
01:00:44,641 --> 01:00:46,871
Everyone would
be afraid to play hard...

1003
01:00:46,909 --> 01:00:49,742
because they'll be worried
about her breaking something...

1004
01:00:49,779 --> 01:00:51,269
or whining
'cause she's bleeding.

1005
01:00:51,314 --> 01:00:53,714
She can't run as fast.

1006
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:56,446
She can't kick as hard.

1007
01:00:56,486 --> 01:00:59,114
I don't want to lose
'cause of her.

1008
01:01:03,126 --> 01:01:05,094
Just because she's
Johnny's sister and he died...

1009
01:01:05,128 --> 01:01:06,618
doesn't mean
she should play.

1010
01:01:06,663 --> 01:01:10,827
I look for speed,
ball control, passing ability.

1011
01:01:10,867 --> 01:01:14,894
All abilities a girl could
demonstrate as well as a boy.

1012
01:01:14,937 --> 01:01:16,768
Never seen it.

1013
01:01:17,940 --> 01:01:19,339
I'd like to say something.

1014
01:01:21,344 --> 01:01:22,333
Yes?

1015
01:01:22,378 --> 01:01:23,902
I'm Lindsay Bowen.

1016
01:01:23,946 --> 01:01:25,538
I'm Gracie's mother.

1017
01:01:25,581 --> 01:01:27,515
You have to be
on the sheet to speak.

1018
01:01:30,687 --> 01:01:33,713
There. She's on the sheet.

1019
01:01:33,756 --> 01:01:36,953
Please, Mrs. Bowen,
go ahead.

1020
01:01:38,861 --> 01:01:43,594
I know that all of you
must be asking if you were me...

1021
01:01:43,633 --> 01:01:46,932
would you let your daughter play
on a boys' team?

1022
01:01:46,969 --> 01:01:49,870
Boys play really rough,
and, um, she could get hurt.

1023
01:01:49,906 --> 01:01:51,567
But I've seen her.

1024
01:01:51,607 --> 01:01:54,633
I've seen her go out
in the cold, in the rain...

1025
01:01:54,677 --> 01:01:56,076
in the dark.

1026
01:01:56,112 --> 01:01:57,602
She is fierce.

1027
01:01:57,647 --> 01:02:00,081
She wants to win.

1028
01:02:00,116 --> 01:02:03,142
She will not give up
because she has a dream.

1029
01:02:03,186 --> 01:02:06,622
For all of my boys,
soccer is and was...

1030
01:02:06,656 --> 01:02:08,089
the most important thing
in their life...

1031
01:02:08,124 --> 01:02:11,616
and it is
the same for Gracie.

1032
01:02:11,661 --> 01:02:13,185
She loves competing.

1033
01:02:13,229 --> 01:02:16,528
She loves
that win-or-lose life.

1034
01:02:16,566 --> 01:02:18,966
L... I don't.

1035
01:02:22,772 --> 01:02:24,603
It's been lonely.

1036
01:02:26,375 --> 01:02:28,309
Gracie's my only daughter...

1037
01:02:28,344 --> 01:02:30,574
but I would rather miss her
than have her miss something...

1038
01:02:30,613 --> 01:02:33,605
that is
so very part of her being.

1039
01:02:35,485 --> 01:02:37,453
Thank you.

1040
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:55,567
The board split.

1041
01:02:55,605 --> 01:02:57,539
I'm afraid I had
to cast the final vote.

1042
01:02:57,573 --> 01:02:58,597
She gets to play?

1043
01:02:58,641 --> 01:03:00,370
To try out.

1044
01:03:00,409 --> 01:03:02,400
Thank you so much.

1045
01:03:02,445 --> 01:03:03,935
It's up to Coach Colasanti...

1046
01:03:03,980 --> 01:03:05,914
to decide
if you'll make the team.

1047
01:03:05,948 --> 01:03:07,813
It's up to Gracie.

1048
01:03:07,850 --> 01:03:10,341
- You got to stretch out.
- Yeah, Dad.

1049
01:03:10,386 --> 01:03:12,411
Yeah. But don't
stretch out too fast.

1050
01:03:12,455 --> 01:03:13,615
I don't want you to cramp up.

1051
01:03:13,656 --> 01:03:14,850
I got it.

1052
01:03:19,028 --> 01:03:21,087
There's Johnny.

1053
01:03:21,130 --> 01:03:24,065
Dad, did you ever wish
I was a boy?

1054
01:03:24,100 --> 01:03:26,193
No. No.

1055
01:03:30,540 --> 01:03:32,337
Grace, it's different.

1056
01:03:44,420 --> 01:03:46,445
Just easier with Johnny.

1057
01:03:46,489 --> 01:03:48,423
I don't know why.

1058
01:03:51,194 --> 01:03:53,628
Sometimes I just
had trouble talking to you.

1059
01:03:59,168 --> 01:04:00,601
Is that
why you coached Johnny?

1060
01:04:04,707 --> 01:04:06,174
I coach you now.

1061
01:04:12,782 --> 01:04:16,013
Okay, boys, let's go.

1062
01:04:22,525 --> 01:04:25,221
Coach is gonna make
three cuts today...

1063
01:04:25,261 --> 01:04:27,126
this morning, after lunch,
then tonight.

1064
01:04:27,163 --> 01:04:29,859
So, uh, don't show him
everything in the first hour.

1065
01:04:29,899 --> 01:04:31,662
Can you hand me that?

1066
01:04:35,705 --> 01:04:37,866
Just pace yourself.
Be a team player.

1067
01:04:37,907 --> 01:04:40,341
Yeah, like I'm not gonna
stick out already.

1068
01:04:40,376 --> 01:04:42,970
Hey, Johnny once told me
about an amazing girl...

1069
01:04:43,012 --> 01:04:44,980
who hit a bottle off
the hood of a car...

1070
01:04:45,014 --> 01:04:47,039
barefooted
from twenty yards out.

1071
01:04:52,021 --> 01:04:57,186
Hey, Gracie,
I know you can do this.

1072
01:04:59,195 --> 01:05:03,962
Group A: Rhodes, Manley,
Jasko, Wicker, Fogel.

1073
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,730
Group B:
Keshawn, Mulstock...

1074
01:05:06,769 --> 01:05:09,567
Martho, McCarthy,
Abbott, Delilo...

1075
01:05:09,605 --> 01:05:12,733
Alston, Ross, Gracie Bowen.

1076
01:05:18,114 --> 01:05:19,206
All right, break.

1077
01:05:22,218 --> 01:05:24,277
Quicker, quicker, quicker.

1078
01:05:33,863 --> 01:05:35,728
Switch.

1079
01:05:47,043 --> 01:05:48,977
Come on.
Teddy, Teddy, come on.

1080
01:05:49,011 --> 01:05:51,104
Quicker, quicker. Switch.

1081
01:05:54,216 --> 01:05:56,377
Call for it. Call for it.

1082
01:05:56,419 --> 01:05:57,818
There you go.
Come on.

1083
01:05:57,853 --> 01:05:59,980
Quicker, quicker, quicker.

1084
01:06:02,425 --> 01:06:04,359
Right here.

1085
01:06:10,299 --> 01:06:12,859
She's not bad.

1086
01:06:12,902 --> 01:06:14,597
I've seen better.

1087
01:06:30,019 --> 01:06:31,953
Go. Come on, Teddy.
See some fight.

1088
01:06:31,988 --> 01:06:35,151
Go. Go.

1089
01:06:35,191 --> 01:06:36,783
See? Come on. Go.

1090
01:06:36,826 --> 01:06:38,487
Get there, Jerome. Get there.

1091
01:06:39,962 --> 01:06:42,624
How's she doin'?

1092
01:06:42,665 --> 01:06:44,724
Yeah.

1093
01:06:44,767 --> 01:06:47,702
Let's go. Let's go.

1094
01:06:47,737 --> 01:06:49,068
Who's gonna be first?

1095
01:06:50,439 --> 01:06:52,270
Let's go.

1096
01:06:53,142 --> 01:06:55,042
Let's go.

1097
01:06:55,978 --> 01:06:57,309
Go.

1098
01:07:00,449 --> 01:07:02,144
Go.

1099
01:07:08,257 --> 01:07:09,622
Shoot it. Shoot it.

1100
01:07:11,060 --> 01:07:13,927
Bowen, look at me.

1101
01:07:13,963 --> 01:07:16,864
When I say "shoot it,"
damn it, you shoot it.

1102
01:07:24,774 --> 01:07:28,107
I made it.
Only one more cut.

1103
01:07:28,144 --> 01:07:29,441
What's wrong?

1104
01:07:29,478 --> 01:07:31,537
You passed 'cause you
didn't want to get hit.

1105
01:07:31,580 --> 01:07:34,014
Yeah, because they were
kicking my butt.

1106
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:36,610
You got to take it, Gracie.
Then you got to give it.

1107
01:07:36,652 --> 01:07:39,621
You got to show 'em
you're no different.

1108
01:07:39,655 --> 01:07:41,953
What the hell's Mr. C.
Thinkin' anyway?

1109
01:07:41,991 --> 01:07:43,356
He has
to make it look real.

1110
01:07:43,392 --> 01:07:45,587
He'll cut her tonight.

1111
01:07:46,996 --> 01:07:49,157
Eat.

1112
01:07:49,198 --> 01:07:50,722
Go on. Eat.

1113
01:07:53,903 --> 01:07:56,201
No way she
finishes tonight.

1114
01:08:07,149 --> 01:08:10,676
Listen up.
I got four yellow shirts here.

1115
01:08:10,719 --> 01:08:14,746
I want to see
who can score a goal.

1116
01:08:14,790 --> 01:08:17,190
Only two of you make the team.

1117
01:08:18,561 --> 01:08:20,426
Break.

1118
01:08:21,730 --> 01:08:23,664
Ready?

1119
01:08:33,609 --> 01:08:35,907
Give me the ball!
Give me the ball!

1120
01:08:44,620 --> 01:08:46,212
- Oh!
- She can take it.

1121
01:08:46,255 --> 01:08:48,723
Sorry.

1122
01:08:48,757 --> 01:08:50,748
Bite me.

1123
01:08:52,228 --> 01:08:54,287
Good work.

1124
01:08:57,700 --> 01:09:00,362
Come on.
Here, here, here, here, here.

1125
01:09:00,402 --> 01:09:02,267
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

1126
01:09:02,304 --> 01:09:04,568
Coming left. Coming left.
Here.

1127
01:09:04,607 --> 01:09:06,165
Left.

1128
01:09:10,112 --> 01:09:12,706
Okay. Okay.

1129
01:09:13,382 --> 01:09:14,747
You all right?

1130
01:09:14,783 --> 01:09:16,375
I was wondering the same
about your whistle.

1131
01:09:16,418 --> 01:09:19,046
Feel free to blow it
at any time.

1132
01:09:19,088 --> 01:09:20,851
You wanted to play
with the boys.

1133
01:09:35,838 --> 01:09:37,567
Come on.

1134
01:09:39,008 --> 01:09:41,476
Come on.

1135
01:09:47,249 --> 01:09:48,739
Go, go, cross.

1136
01:09:48,784 --> 01:09:50,445
Pass it.

1137
01:09:54,790 --> 01:09:55,814
Yes.

1138
01:09:57,059 --> 01:09:59,755
- Yes! Yes! Yes!
- That's my girl!

1139
01:10:04,366 --> 01:10:06,095
All right.
Split into pairs.

1140
01:10:06,135 --> 01:10:08,160
We'll finish up with headers.

1141
01:10:08,204 --> 01:10:10,798
Last hour of tryouts.

1142
01:10:10,839 --> 01:10:12,898
Cutting it a little close,
aren't we?

1143
01:10:12,942 --> 01:10:15,536
Coach C. Said to switch.
Work with someone new.

1144
01:10:15,578 --> 01:10:17,603
I didn't hear him say nothin'.

1145
01:10:17,646 --> 01:10:20,547
That's 'cause you got your
head up your ass. Now, move.

1146
01:10:23,152 --> 01:10:25,382
All right. Let's go for it.

1147
01:10:33,896 --> 01:10:35,158
What was that?

1148
01:10:35,197 --> 01:10:38,257
I saw that, Rhodes!

1149
01:10:41,570 --> 01:10:43,504
Bowen, you're out.

1150
01:10:43,539 --> 01:10:45,063
Screw you.

1151
01:10:45,107 --> 01:10:48,543
- What did you say?
- "Good luck to all of you."

1152
01:10:48,577 --> 01:10:50,374
That's what I thought.

1153
01:10:50,412 --> 01:10:52,505
Get lost, Bowen, before
my hearing comes back.

1154
01:10:59,655 --> 01:11:02,715
Yeah, yeah. I know.

1155
01:11:02,758 --> 01:11:04,555
Yes.

1156
01:11:21,677 --> 01:11:22,939
Gracie. Gracie.

1157
01:11:28,050 --> 01:11:29,244
I know what you're gonna say.

1158
01:11:29,285 --> 01:11:30,718
I am good enough.

1159
01:11:30,753 --> 01:11:32,118
That's why your name's
on the board.

1160
01:11:32,154 --> 01:11:33,143
Yeah? Where?

1161
01:11:33,188 --> 01:11:35,588
- Junior varsity.
- Junior varsity.

1162
01:11:35,624 --> 01:11:37,148
If you're gonna be
the first girl on my team...

1163
01:11:37,192 --> 01:11:39,126
then you got
to be better than good.

1164
01:11:39,161 --> 01:11:40,992
And you got to act
like you deserve to be there.

1165
01:11:41,030 --> 01:11:43,590
- I do deserve it.
- I don't see it.

1166
01:11:45,534 --> 01:11:47,399
I offered your dad
a coaching job.

1167
01:11:57,212 --> 01:11:58,440
Hey.

1168
01:12:02,251 --> 01:12:04,048
I'm goin' back.

1169
01:12:04,086 --> 01:12:07,249
The supervisor put it down
as a leave of absence.

1170
01:12:07,289 --> 01:12:08,722
You hate that place.

1171
01:12:08,757 --> 01:12:12,921
Yep. And I'm working nights
at the warehouse.

1172
01:12:12,961 --> 01:12:16,089
But after work,
you get to coach.

1173
01:12:16,131 --> 01:12:18,065
I'm glad it
all worked out for you.

1174
01:12:19,168 --> 01:12:20,226
Hey.

1175
01:12:28,110 --> 01:12:29,771
Sometimes, you just take
what you're offered...

1176
01:12:29,812 --> 01:12:30,904
and make the best of it,
you know.

1177
01:12:30,946 --> 01:12:32,937
Yeah, and eat
the shit sandwich.

1178
01:12:32,981 --> 01:12:35,074
I'm not doin' it. I quit.

1179
01:12:37,386 --> 01:12:38,717
Johnny was a star...

1180
01:12:38,754 --> 01:12:40,415
I don't want to hear about
Johnny.

1181
01:12:40,456 --> 01:12:41,923
Johnny's dead.

1182
01:12:47,096 --> 01:12:50,293
Johnny played more for me
than he played for himself.

1183
01:12:50,332 --> 01:12:52,664
You're different.
You truly love this game.

1184
01:12:52,701 --> 01:12:54,464
That's coaching crap.

1185
01:12:54,503 --> 01:12:56,232
Quit, why don't you, then?

1186
01:12:56,271 --> 01:12:57,898
But quit 'cause
you're not good enough.

1187
01:12:57,940 --> 01:12:59,669
Quit 'cause you're never
gonna be good enough.

1188
01:12:59,708 --> 01:13:01,107
Don't quit because you got
your feelings hurt...

1189
01:13:01,143 --> 01:13:02,542
like a little girl!

1190
01:13:09,818 --> 01:13:12,343
You got to dig deep
and go out there...

1191
01:13:12,388 --> 01:13:14,117
as tough and strong as anyone.

1192
01:13:14,156 --> 01:13:15,316
I did.

1193
01:13:15,357 --> 01:13:17,917
No, you didn't.
I know what you can do.

1194
01:13:17,960 --> 01:13:19,291
But it's not enough
that I believe in you.

1195
01:13:19,328 --> 01:13:21,125
You got to make them all
believe in you.

1196
01:13:21,163 --> 01:13:23,723
And how do I do that?

1197
01:13:23,766 --> 01:13:25,996
You know what to do.

1198
01:13:58,233 --> 01:13:59,461
Good boy.

1199
01:14:20,522 --> 01:14:23,082
They practice today?

1200
01:14:23,125 --> 01:14:24,786
Are you gonna play J. V?

1201
01:14:24,827 --> 01:14:28,092
Yep. But I won't
be back till late.

1202
01:14:37,172 --> 01:14:38,901
Let's go, let's go.

1203
01:14:38,941 --> 01:14:40,067
- Down.
- G-O.

1204
01:14:40,108 --> 01:14:41,439
Let's go, let's go.

1205
01:14:41,477 --> 01:14:42,774
G-O.

1206
01:14:42,811 --> 01:14:44,904
Let's go, let's go.

1207
01:14:44,947 --> 01:14:45,936
G-O. Let's go, let's go.

1208
01:14:45,981 --> 01:14:48,176
Hey, Gracie.

1209
01:14:48,217 --> 01:14:50,276
Go get 'em.

1210
01:14:50,319 --> 01:14:51,616
G-O.

1211
01:14:51,653 --> 01:14:53,678
Let's go, let's go.

1212
01:14:58,794 --> 01:15:01,194
Down. Up.

1213
01:15:39,134 --> 01:15:41,227
Kyle didn't even want me
on the team, Gracie.

1214
01:15:41,270 --> 01:15:44,205
He just wanted to hang out
so we could talk about you.

1215
01:15:49,444 --> 01:15:51,912
I loved Johnny, Gracie.

1216
01:15:53,715 --> 01:15:55,683
He left me, too.

1217
01:15:58,520 --> 01:16:02,149
Anyway, I already have
a new best friend...

1218
01:16:02,190 --> 01:16:04,181
and I'm gonna stay here
with her until she's done.

1219
01:16:06,828 --> 01:16:10,628
If she decides she wants
some food, it's here, too.

1220
01:16:20,008 --> 01:16:22,067
Heard that's a good book.

1221
01:16:29,051 --> 01:16:30,541
We drew Kingston
for our first game.

1222
01:16:30,586 --> 01:16:31,814
The whole town's comin' out.

1223
01:16:34,323 --> 01:16:35,813
I want you there.

1224
01:16:35,857 --> 01:16:36,915
To play?

1225
01:16:36,959 --> 01:16:38,449
To support your team.

1226
01:16:38,493 --> 01:16:40,120
You mean to sit on the bench.

1227
01:16:43,332 --> 01:16:45,425
The team's
wearin' armbands for Johnny.

1228
01:17:14,863 --> 01:17:16,262
Go on.

1229
01:17:17,866 --> 01:17:19,458
Go.

1230
01:17:19,501 --> 01:17:21,696
You can do it.

1231
01:17:21,737 --> 01:17:23,728
Go.

1232
01:17:34,349 --> 01:17:35,475
You'll be fine.

1233
01:17:53,235 --> 01:17:54,224
- Let's go, boys.
- Yes, sir!

1234
01:17:54,269 --> 01:17:55,258
Go, go, go.

1235
01:17:55,303 --> 01:17:56,292
- Right.
- Let's move it up.

1236
01:17:56,338 --> 01:17:57,327
Yes...

1237
01:17:57,372 --> 01:17:59,397
We got a game to win.

1238
01:18:01,810 --> 01:18:04,335
G-O.

1239
01:18:04,379 --> 01:18:07,246
Let's go.

1240
01:18:19,628 --> 01:18:20,617
Let's go, boys.

1241
01:18:20,662 --> 01:18:22,323
Go, go, go!

1242
01:18:26,268 --> 01:18:27,792
I'm here
for the game, Coach.

1243
01:18:27,836 --> 01:18:28,825
Hey.

1244
01:18:28,870 --> 01:18:30,895
I got a jersey for you.

1245
01:18:38,714 --> 01:18:40,181
This was Johnny's.

1246
01:18:40,215 --> 01:18:42,911
Now it's yours.

1247
01:18:50,792 --> 01:18:52,623
Switch it. Switch it.

1248
01:18:52,661 --> 01:18:54,128
Close it up. Close it up.

1249
01:18:54,162 --> 01:18:56,255
Then move. Come on. Go on.

1250
01:18:56,298 --> 01:18:57,322
Take him out.

1251
01:18:58,767 --> 01:19:00,462
There it is.
There it is.

1252
01:19:01,770 --> 01:19:04,739
Oh!

1253
01:19:06,141 --> 01:19:07,699
Come on,
get back on defense!

1254
01:19:07,743 --> 01:19:08,971
Move it back!

1255
01:19:11,346 --> 01:19:14,076
Flatten out here.
Flatten out.

1256
01:19:15,617 --> 01:19:17,812
No cross.

1257
01:19:17,853 --> 01:19:19,377
Move it up.

1258
01:19:19,421 --> 01:19:21,252
Move it up, boys.

1259
01:19:23,125 --> 01:19:25,286
Switch it, switch it.
Switch the field.

1260
01:19:25,327 --> 01:19:27,090
Pressure.
Get pressure in there.

1261
01:19:28,864 --> 01:19:31,094
Yeah.

1262
01:19:37,272 --> 01:19:39,570
That's what we want!
That's what we want!

1263
01:19:39,608 --> 01:19:41,371
I'm on it. I'm on it.

1264
01:19:41,409 --> 01:19:43,809
I told you to cover
the far post.

1265
01:19:43,845 --> 01:19:46,837
Wicker, go in for Polo.

1266
01:19:48,016 --> 01:19:49,881
Move it, Wicker.

1267
01:19:49,918 --> 01:19:52,182
Pick him up.
Pick him up, pick him up.

1268
01:19:52,220 --> 01:19:53,949
Squeeze him, Donny,
squeeze him.

1269
01:19:56,658 --> 01:19:58,091
Pick it up. Pick it up.

1270
01:19:59,728 --> 01:20:01,127
Pick up the side.

1271
01:20:05,133 --> 01:20:06,361
Whoo-hoo!

1272
01:20:07,469 --> 01:20:08,834
Did you see that?

1273
01:20:08,870 --> 01:20:11,566
Did anybody pick him up?
No! He just walked in there!

1274
01:20:11,606 --> 01:20:12,937
Yeah!

1275
01:20:17,746 --> 01:20:20,544
It's sudden death overtime.
Whoever scores wins.

1276
01:20:20,582 --> 01:20:22,345
I'm not a moron.

1277
01:20:36,264 --> 01:20:37,322
That's a nice hit.

1278
01:20:39,801 --> 01:20:41,996
Peter. Peter.

1279
01:20:42,037 --> 01:20:43,402
Tell Kyle
to stay down. Hurry.

1280
01:20:46,074 --> 01:20:48,235
Ref, I'm makin' a change.

1281
01:20:48,276 --> 01:20:50,870
Coach, Coach, I'm fine.
I can still play.

1282
01:20:50,912 --> 01:20:52,641
Bowen.

1283
01:20:54,349 --> 01:20:56,214
Bowen.

1284
01:20:56,251 --> 01:20:57,980
Get up here.

1285
01:21:03,091 --> 01:21:05,992
I want you to take
the free kick.

1286
01:21:06,027 --> 01:21:07,551
Can you do it?

1287
01:21:13,168 --> 01:21:15,500
Okay, get in there.

1288
01:21:19,241 --> 01:21:21,971
Whatever you do,
hit the target.

1289
01:21:25,146 --> 01:21:27,444
Big freakin' mistake.

1290
01:21:27,482 --> 01:21:28,608
Colasanti.

1291
01:21:28,650 --> 01:21:30,117
Sit down.

1292
01:21:36,291 --> 01:21:37,758
What are you doing?

1293
01:21:37,792 --> 01:21:39,953
I'm taking the shot.

1294
01:21:39,995 --> 01:21:41,155
You got to be kidding me.

1295
01:21:41,196 --> 01:21:42,754
This better be good.

1296
01:21:46,167 --> 01:21:47,293
Don't blow it.

1297
01:21:50,171 --> 01:21:52,935
Come on, Gracie.

1298
01:21:54,542 --> 01:21:56,407
You can do this.

1299
01:22:13,495 --> 01:22:15,087
Wait till you're ready.

1300
01:22:17,065 --> 01:22:19,124
You can do anything.

1301
01:22:21,903 --> 01:22:23,131
I... I can't look.

1302
01:23:04,713 --> 01:23:06,442
Bowen, what are you doin'?

1303
01:23:06,481 --> 01:23:07,880
Get your head in the game.

1304
01:23:07,916 --> 01:23:09,110
You got corner.

1305
01:23:09,150 --> 01:23:10,845
You better be there.

1306
01:23:18,493 --> 01:23:20,188
Get back. Get back.

1307
01:23:20,228 --> 01:23:22,355
Let's get back!

1308
01:23:27,235 --> 01:23:28,793
Tighten up.

1309
01:23:42,951 --> 01:23:44,646
I told you to cover
the far post.

1310
01:23:44,686 --> 01:23:46,517
You don't want to do it,
you get off the field.

1311
01:23:46,554 --> 01:23:47,782
Give me the ball.

1312
01:23:47,822 --> 01:23:49,153
Bowen, what are you doin!?

1313
01:23:50,392 --> 01:23:51,825
You're playing forward.

1314
01:24:02,637 --> 01:24:06,198
Give me the ball.
Give me the ball.

1315
01:24:10,245 --> 01:24:12,213
Get rid of it, Bowen.
Get rid of it.

1316
01:24:18,186 --> 01:24:19,619
Oh!

1317
01:24:26,528 --> 01:24:28,291
Ref, that's a foul.

1318
01:24:41,509 --> 01:24:45,639
Come on, Bowen.
Get off the field.

1319
01:24:54,355 --> 01:24:56,846
Off the field.

1320
01:25:25,587 --> 01:25:27,987
Give me the ball.

1321
01:26:23,912 --> 01:26:26,676
Pass it. I'm open. Pass it.

1322
01:26:26,714 --> 01:26:28,204
Pass it! Pass it!

1323
01:26:42,197 --> 01:26:43,221
Finish it. Finish it.

1324
01:26:56,010 --> 01:26:57,238
Yeah!

1325
01:27:07,488 --> 01:27:09,581
She did it!

1326
01:27:09,624 --> 01:27:11,319
She did it!

1327
01:27:11,359 --> 01:27:14,157
She did it!

1328
01:27:39,387 --> 01:27:41,947
Yeah!

1329
01:28:08,483 --> 01:28:10,713
Gracie!

1330
01:28:15,089 --> 01:28:16,920
Dad!

1331
01:28:21,329 --> 01:28:23,820
Daddy!

1332
01:28:27,635 --> 01:28:29,865
Gracie!

1333
01:28:36,177 --> 01:28:37,303
Gracie!

1334
01:28:37,345 --> 01:28:39,142
Gracie! Gracie!

1335
01:28:39,180 --> 01:28:40,579
Gracie! Gracie!

1336
01:28:40,615 --> 01:28:42,310
Gracie! Gracie!

1337
01:28:42,350 --> 01:28:44,011
Gracie! Gracie!

1338
01:28:44,052 --> 01:28:45,644
Gracie! Gracie!

1339
01:28:45,687 --> 01:28:47,450
Gracie! Gracie!

1340
01:28:47,488 --> 01:28:49,217
Gracie!

1341
01:29:42,310 --> 01:29:46,041
# Well, I stood stone-like
at midnight #

1342
01:29:46,080 --> 01:29:49,641
# Suspended in my masquerade #

1343
01:29:49,684 --> 01:29:53,313
# And I combed my hair
till it was just right #

1344
01:29:53,354 --> 01:29:57,188
# And commanded
the night brigade #

1345
01:29:57,225 --> 01:30:01,218
# I was open to pain
and crossed by the rain #

1346
01:30:01,262 --> 01:30:03,890
# And I walked
on a crooked crutch #

1347
01:30:03,931 --> 01:30:07,992
# I strolled all alone
through a fallout zone #

1348
01:30:08,035 --> 01:30:12,165
# Came out
with my soul untouched #

1349
01:30:12,206 --> 01:30:15,300
# I hid in the clouded wrath
of the crowd #

1350
01:30:15,343 --> 01:30:19,439
# When they said, "Sit down,"
I stood up #

1351
01:30:19,480 --> 01:30:23,041
# Ooh #

1352
01:30:23,084 --> 01:30:28,021
# Growin' up #

1353
01:30:29,957 --> 01:30:33,290
# The flag of piracy
flew from my mast #

1354
01:30:33,327 --> 01:30:37,093
# My sails were set
wing to wing #

1355
01:30:37,131 --> 01:30:40,532
# I had a jukebox
graduate for first mate #

1356
01:30:40,568 --> 01:30:44,231
# She couldn't sail,
but she sure could sing #

1357
01:30:44,272 --> 01:30:48,140
# And I pushed b-52
and bombed them with the blues #

1358
01:30:48,176 --> 01:30:51,805
# With my gear set stubborn
on standing #

1359
01:30:51,846 --> 01:30:55,475
# I broke all the rules,
strafed my own high school #

1360
01:30:55,516 --> 01:30:59,179
# Never once gave thought
to landing #

1361
01:30:59,220 --> 01:31:02,087
# I hid in the clouded warmth
of the crowd #

1362
01:31:02,123 --> 01:31:06,685
# When they said, "Come down,"
I threw up #

1363
01:31:06,727 --> 01:31:10,288
# Ooh #

1364
01:31:10,331 --> 01:31:13,994
# Growin' up #

1365
01:31:14,035 --> 01:31:17,698
# Ooh #

1366
01:31:17,738 --> 01:31:21,003
# Growin' up #
