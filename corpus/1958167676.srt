1
00:00:09,611 --> 00:00:11,243
- Welcome back everyone.

2
00:00:11,245 --> 00:00:13,078
We've had even more
disappearances lately

3
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,680
that I believe is tied

4
00:00:14,682 --> 00:00:17,249
to the Brotherhood
of Darkness cult

5
00:00:17,251 --> 00:00:18,651
that are Satanic worshipers,

6
00:00:18,653 --> 00:00:20,285
and they're dressed
as hooded monks

7
00:00:20,287 --> 00:00:22,220
and they are led by
one Messiah Ward.

8
00:00:22,222 --> 00:00:24,524
Now, if you haven't
heard of these guys,

9
00:00:24,526 --> 00:00:26,024
they first popped up in
Wellsboro, Pennsylvania,

10
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:27,760
around a decade ago,

11
00:00:27,762 --> 00:00:30,428
but there's evidence that it
could be even further back.

12
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:32,565
They could have popped
up around in the 80s,

13
00:00:32,567 --> 00:00:34,232
and they've potentially spread

14
00:00:34,234 --> 00:00:36,502
to other rural areas
around the country.

15
00:00:36,504 --> 00:00:38,538
Now, as a Kaiju podcaster,

16
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:40,171
the reason I'm
talking about this

17
00:00:40,173 --> 00:00:42,073
is because there is
a higher than average

18
00:00:42,075 --> 00:00:45,645
number of disappearances in
areas that the cult is in,

19
00:00:45,647 --> 00:00:47,813
and the killings are brutal.

20
00:00:47,815 --> 00:00:50,616
I'm talking decapitation,
disembowelment, dismemberment,

21
00:00:50,618 --> 00:00:52,284
and there's never been any ties

22
00:00:52,286 --> 00:00:55,353
or convictions made
to the cult at all,

23
00:00:55,355 --> 00:00:57,355
and I believe I know why.

24
00:00:57,357 --> 00:01:00,260
The cult has enlisted the
help of something else,

25
00:01:01,428 --> 00:01:02,296
a lake monster.

26
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:53,581
- Tell me what you see.

27
00:01:55,415 --> 00:01:57,552
- What you ask
for is in a dark place.

28
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:00,653
- I need to know.

29
00:02:00,655 --> 00:02:02,220
- Silence.

30
00:02:02,222 --> 00:02:05,591
I need to concentrate
to send my soul

31
00:02:05,593 --> 00:02:08,730
to see in such a terrible place.

32
00:02:10,565 --> 00:02:12,700
- If you find it,
I can stop it here and now.

33
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:16,902
- Evil that
has existed for so long

34
00:02:16,904 --> 00:02:19,639
cannot be vanquished so easily,

35
00:02:19,641 --> 00:02:22,275
even by someone
with so much faith.

36
00:02:23,845 --> 00:02:28,583
I see, I see shadowy figures
full of hate and rage.

37
00:02:30,818 --> 00:02:35,188
I see twisted souls
with no way of escape.

38
00:02:36,924 --> 00:02:39,326
I see blood and carnage.

39
00:02:40,628 --> 00:02:42,260
- Where are they?

40
00:02:42,262 --> 00:02:43,898
What location is home
to this evil cancer?

41
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:47,735
- A deep
black pool of water.

42
00:02:49,436 --> 00:02:50,337
A dwelling nearby.

43
00:02:51,405 --> 00:02:52,740
It is all I can see.

44
00:02:54,474 --> 00:02:55,941
I cannot pass any further,

45
00:02:55,943 --> 00:02:57,945
and you, you must not
interfere by yourself.

46
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:00,746
- I must.

47
00:03:00,748 --> 00:03:02,313
It needs to end now.

48
00:03:02,315 --> 00:03:04,251
- Nothing ever ends.

49
00:03:05,853 --> 00:03:08,255
It takes on a different form
and continues on the same path.

50
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:10,925
Beware and be strong.

51
00:06:05,633 --> 00:06:09,034
- My children,
my flock, welcome.

52
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:13,839
We have been gathered here
for our final sacrifice,

53
00:06:13,841 --> 00:06:17,843
as our master calls
us to a darker place.

54
00:06:17,845 --> 00:06:21,549
Our shaman has seen
it in a vision.

55
00:06:22,817 --> 00:06:26,384
We have been prosecuted
through the ages

56
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,587
for our service to our Lord.

57
00:06:28,589 --> 00:06:32,691
Burned at the stake by infidels.

58
00:06:32,693 --> 00:06:37,698
Now the time has arrived
for our fiery transition.

59
00:06:38,498 --> 00:06:40,566
Do not fear.

60
00:06:40,568 --> 00:06:42,601
Do not fear.

61
00:06:42,603 --> 00:06:45,940
The brotherhood of
darkness shall reign.

62
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:23,210
Drink the life giving fluid
as the hour draws near.

63
00:07:54,175 --> 00:07:57,778
We welcome your cold
embrace, oh Master.

64
00:08:28,075 --> 00:08:31,145
We've been expecting
you, old friend.

65
00:08:38,019 --> 00:08:40,287
Do what you came here to do.

66
00:09:12,186 --> 00:09:14,753
- Relish in hell.

67
00:09:14,755 --> 00:09:16,057
Enjoy your journey
to the dark abyss.

68
00:10:00,101 --> 00:10:01,166
- What is it?

69
00:10:01,168 --> 00:10:02,036
- Huh?

70
00:10:03,938 --> 00:10:05,237
- Was it my beans from earlier?

71
00:10:05,239 --> 00:10:06,974
You're acting all distressed.

72
00:10:07,908 --> 00:10:08,843
- The air.

73
00:10:10,678 --> 00:10:11,912
It's so still, funny like.

74
00:10:13,714 --> 00:10:15,783
- Now you're just acting
like a scared little child.

75
00:10:17,184 --> 00:10:19,086
- Nothing been same
around here since...

76
00:10:21,322 --> 00:10:22,189
- Since?

77
00:10:23,624 --> 00:10:24,892
The suspense is killing me.

78
00:10:26,627 --> 00:10:29,363
- Since the massacre of
Messiah Ward and his followers.

79
00:10:30,965 --> 00:10:32,865
- That jerk and his clan
got what they deserved.

80
00:10:32,867 --> 00:10:35,169
Probably some secret op
came in and wiped 'em out.

81
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:37,204
None too soon.

82
00:10:38,772 --> 00:10:40,873
The Brotherhood of
Darkness.

83
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:41,909
They were no good for anybody.

84
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:48,347
- They say his spirit
still roams these parts

85
00:10:48,349 --> 00:10:50,784
in revenge for what
happened to 'em.

86
00:10:52,253 --> 00:10:53,120
Maybe we should go.

87
00:10:54,054 --> 00:10:55,356
- Stop acting silly.

88
00:10:56,957 --> 00:10:58,657
Catch some fish so we
can get on outta here.

89
00:10:59,793 --> 00:11:01,393
What the hell?!

90
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,200
- What is that?

91
00:11:08,202 --> 00:11:10,235
- It's another boat.

92
00:11:10,237 --> 00:11:11,403
- Is it?

93
00:11:11,405 --> 00:11:13,407
- And they don't see us.

94
00:11:15,409 --> 00:11:16,742
Wave your arms around.

95
00:11:16,744 --> 00:11:18,744
They're about to run us over!

96
00:11:18,746 --> 00:11:20,078
Yo, hey yo!

97
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,980
Yo, hey yo!
- Hey, yo!

98
00:11:21,982 --> 00:11:24,449
- Yo, over here!
- Right here!

99
00:11:27,054 --> 00:11:27,922
- Orville!

100
00:11:28,856 --> 00:11:30,291
Orville, oh my God.

101
00:11:34,328 --> 00:11:35,360
Where are you?

102
00:11:36,797 --> 00:11:37,798
Who are you?

103
00:13:21,335 --> 00:13:23,871
- Yes, old technology
you can count on.

104
00:13:29,243 --> 00:13:32,446
Lake Jude Patrol Chief,
Barney Rayl, speaking.

105
00:13:33,515 --> 00:13:34,381
How may I help you?

106
00:13:35,949 --> 00:13:39,086
What, a swamped boat
at Lodger's Point?

107
00:13:42,323 --> 00:13:43,591
Probably Ned and Orville's.

108
00:13:45,359 --> 00:13:47,127
You know they're illegally
fish in that spot all the time.

109
00:13:48,563 --> 00:13:49,430
Yep.

110
00:13:50,497 --> 00:13:51,932
Okay, I'll be right down.

111
00:13:57,838 --> 00:14:01,408
If that boat belongs to them,
I'll fine them both this time.

112
00:14:55,028 --> 00:14:56,928
Barney to HQ.

113
00:14:56,930 --> 00:15:00,332
I'm in boat number seven and
I'm heading to Lodger's Point

114
00:15:00,334 --> 00:15:02,000
to check on a swamped boat.

115
00:15:02,002 --> 00:15:04,302
I'll report in after
I assess the scene,

116
00:15:04,304 --> 00:15:07,207
but I'm sure it belongs
to Ned and Orville, out.

117
00:15:42,109 --> 00:15:44,111
- Smile and fog.

118
00:16:04,566 --> 00:16:07,032
- It's another
sunny day here in Wellsboro,

119
00:16:07,034 --> 00:16:08,433
as we mark the two
year anniversary

120
00:16:08,435 --> 00:16:11,205
of the Brotherhood
of Darkness massacre.

121
00:16:12,339 --> 00:16:14,272
Messiah Ward may be long gone,

122
00:16:14,274 --> 00:16:17,643
but his shadow still casts a
dark curtain over the town.

123
00:16:17,645 --> 00:16:22,650
However, our community is
strong and we continue to heal.

124
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:25,250
In lighter news,

125
00:16:25,252 --> 00:16:27,452
striper season is
in full swing here

126
00:16:27,454 --> 00:16:29,555
as fishermen from all
over descend on the lake

127
00:16:29,557 --> 00:16:32,226
for some of the finest
fishing in the Northeast.

128
00:17:09,062 --> 00:17:12,266
- This is their boat, but
where the hell are they?

129
00:17:16,671 --> 00:17:17,539
Damn!

130
00:17:28,516 --> 00:17:29,751
What the hell happened here?

131
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:04,282
- Two men are
dead in a boating accident

132
00:18:04,284 --> 00:18:07,385
during Wellsboro's annual
Striper Fishing Season event.

133
00:18:07,387 --> 00:18:09,354
In an apparent hit and run,

134
00:18:09,356 --> 00:18:11,456
police said the other
driver fled the scene

135
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:13,859
and were currently
investigating leads.

136
00:18:13,861 --> 00:18:15,493
Officials wouldn't
comment further

137
00:18:15,495 --> 00:18:17,095
due to the ongoing
investigation,

138
00:18:17,097 --> 00:18:18,598
but they asked if anyone
has any information

139
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,568
to call their local
police department.

140
00:18:22,235 --> 00:18:24,102
In weather, a cold front
is moving into the area

141
00:18:24,104 --> 00:18:25,238
later this week.

142
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:14,720
- It's happening again.

143
00:21:51,478 --> 00:21:52,477
- Nice.

144
00:22:47,467 --> 00:22:48,901
Hello?

145
00:22:48,903 --> 00:22:50,636
- Hey,
Lena, how's it going?

146
00:22:50,638 --> 00:22:52,504
You didn't call me this morning.

147
00:22:52,506 --> 00:22:54,441
- I decided to head over
to the lake a little early.

148
00:22:55,509 --> 00:22:56,775
Making the most of my day off.

149
00:22:56,777 --> 00:22:58,711
Are you coming out later?

150
00:22:58,713 --> 00:23:00,145
- I might.

151
00:23:00,147 --> 00:23:01,479
Where are you exactly?

152
00:23:01,481 --> 00:23:03,448
- I'm near Lodger's Point.

153
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:04,118
It's beautiful.

154
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:06,785
- Hmm, I'd be careful.

155
00:23:06,787 --> 00:23:08,453
- Why?

156
00:23:08,455 --> 00:23:10,155
- I just
heard on the news

157
00:23:10,157 --> 00:23:10,625
that the Lake Patrol found
some bodies near there.

158
00:23:11,959 --> 00:23:14,126
- Well, you wouldn't
know by looking around?

159
00:23:14,128 --> 00:23:15,129
What happened?

160
00:23:16,697 --> 00:23:18,831
- A boating
accident, I think.

161
00:23:18,833 --> 00:23:19,932
- Oh, well there you go.

162
00:23:19,934 --> 00:23:21,967
Nothing to worry about.

163
00:23:21,969 --> 00:23:24,972
I'm gonna swim, not boat,
so I should be fine.

164
00:23:26,641 --> 00:23:27,773
- Be careful
just the same.

165
00:23:27,775 --> 00:23:29,675
That place has a history.

166
00:23:29,677 --> 00:23:31,644
I don't know why you don't
use Bunk Beach instead.

167
00:23:31,646 --> 00:23:33,078
- It's too crowded over there.

168
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:35,917
Lots of noisy brats
and perverted learers.

169
00:23:37,417 --> 00:23:38,751
- The perverts
are the most fun.

170
00:23:38,753 --> 00:23:40,487
- Figured you'd say that.

171
00:23:41,856 --> 00:23:44,590
Listen, give me a ring
when you head over.

172
00:23:44,592 --> 00:23:45,724
- If I head over.

173
00:23:45,726 --> 00:23:47,128
- Okay, if you head over.

174
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:51,096
We can grab some lunch
by the concessions stand.

175
00:23:51,098 --> 00:23:52,665
- Okay,
catch you later, bye.

176
00:23:52,667 --> 00:23:53,534
- See you.

177
00:23:57,972 --> 00:24:02,977
Ah.

178
00:24:25,533 --> 00:24:26,200
That's a boat.

179
00:24:27,568 --> 00:24:28,934
Better watch out for rocks,

180
00:24:28,936 --> 00:24:29,937
it's pretty shallow
in this area.

181
00:24:41,782 --> 00:24:43,115
Hello?

182
00:24:43,117 --> 00:24:44,950
Hey asshole,

183
00:24:44,952 --> 00:24:47,621
you're not supposed mull
your top this close to shore.

184
00:24:48,889 --> 00:24:50,658
Where'd you come from, anyway?

185
00:24:53,761 --> 00:24:55,529
Well get the hell
outta here then!

186
00:25:02,269 --> 00:25:03,537
Ah, no, help!

187
00:25:43,711 --> 00:25:45,312
- Mm, that's some good Joe.

188
00:25:52,153 --> 00:25:56,121
Lake Jude Patrol Chief,
Barney Rayl, speaking.

189
00:25:56,123 --> 00:25:56,991
How may I help you?

190
00:25:58,325 --> 00:26:00,928
What, another body?

191
00:26:01,962 --> 00:26:03,330
That's three in one day.

192
00:26:05,032 --> 00:26:05,900
Where?

193
00:26:07,234 --> 00:26:08,702
Lodger's Point.

194
00:26:10,071 --> 00:26:13,806
Okay, close off the area
until further notice.

195
00:26:13,808 --> 00:26:14,675
I'll be right there.

196
00:26:18,979 --> 00:26:21,649
Dying around here is
becoming a bad habit.

197
00:26:50,744 --> 00:26:52,811
- Who was Messiah Ward?

198
00:26:52,813 --> 00:26:55,280
Leader of the Brotherhood
of Darkness cult.

199
00:26:55,282 --> 00:26:58,383
Very little is known about
the man and his followers

200
00:26:58,385 --> 00:27:00,252
who have maintained
a low profile

201
00:27:00,254 --> 00:27:03,689
since settling in the area
some 10 years earlier.

202
00:27:03,691 --> 00:27:05,290
They've been blamed
for the disappearance

203
00:27:05,292 --> 00:27:08,260
of several domestic animals
by nearby residents,

204
00:27:08,262 --> 00:27:10,395
but nothing was ever proven.

205
00:27:10,397 --> 00:27:14,766
Some had even accused
them of being behind

206
00:27:14,768 --> 00:27:18,070
the disappearance of two
hikers some four years ago

207
00:27:18,072 --> 00:27:19,273
near the Mount Tom Trail.

208
00:27:20,975 --> 00:27:22,209
But again, no connections
were ever made.

209
00:27:35,022 --> 00:27:37,122
- Well, what do you think?

210
00:27:37,124 --> 00:27:40,125
- It's obviously a
boating accident.

211
00:27:40,127 --> 00:27:42,763
She got too close
to the propeller.

212
00:27:44,431 --> 00:27:49,203
Whether it was a hit and run
or malicious, I don't know.

213
00:27:51,705 --> 00:27:55,040
- Three boating
accidents in 24 hours?

214
00:27:55,042 --> 00:27:56,343
Seems suspicious.

215
00:27:57,444 --> 00:27:59,077
- It does happen.

216
00:27:59,079 --> 00:28:01,213
When people drink
and get into boats,

217
00:28:01,215 --> 00:28:03,017
all kinds of stupid
things happen.

218
00:28:04,084 --> 00:28:07,019
It's a bad coincidence.

219
00:28:07,021 --> 00:28:09,990
- The question is, whose
propeller killed her?

220
00:28:18,065 --> 00:28:21,166
- Excuse me, may I give
this poor soul Last rights?

221
00:28:21,168 --> 00:28:24,069
No one should die
without absolution.

222
00:28:24,071 --> 00:28:26,171
- A little late for
that, don't you think?

223
00:28:26,173 --> 00:28:29,241
- The Lord is ready to
receive anyone's soul,

224
00:28:29,243 --> 00:28:30,842
even after death.

225
00:28:30,844 --> 00:28:34,215
- Sure, go ahead, but
be quick about it.

226
00:28:43,857 --> 00:28:44,725
- Please wait.

227
00:28:46,994 --> 00:28:48,327
- I'm not dead yet.

228
00:28:48,329 --> 00:28:49,728
I don't need last rights.

229
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:51,129
- I have some information

230
00:28:51,131 --> 00:28:56,070
that may shed some light
on these, accidents.

231
00:28:57,037 --> 00:29:00,105
- You hesitated, why?

232
00:29:00,107 --> 00:29:02,241
You don't think
they're accidents?

233
00:29:02,243 --> 00:29:04,912
Let me guess, the devil did it.

234
00:29:25,332 --> 00:29:27,399
That guy must be a ninja.

235
00:29:27,401 --> 00:29:28,869
I didn't see him leave.

236
00:30:02,504 --> 00:30:05,205
Lake Jude Patrol Chief,
Barney Rayl, speaking.

237
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:08,073
How may I help you?

238
00:30:08,075 --> 00:30:10,208
- Hey Barney, I have a full
report if you wanna listen.

239
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:11,810
- I'm all ears.

240
00:30:11,812 --> 00:30:14,514
- Officially these were
all boating related.

241
00:30:14,516 --> 00:30:18,185
In fact, the boys determined
it was the same propeller.

242
00:30:19,119 --> 00:30:20,254
- Then it is homicide.

243
00:30:21,589 --> 00:30:23,523
- You know what that
strange part is?

244
00:30:23,525 --> 00:30:26,391
- Other than we have a killer
chopping up people on the lake

245
00:30:26,393 --> 00:30:28,060
with an outboard motor?

246
00:30:28,062 --> 00:30:29,928
- The blade marks
aren't consistent

247
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:31,430
with any prop on the market.

248
00:30:31,432 --> 00:30:35,200
It's completely
new, maybe homemade.

249
00:30:35,202 --> 00:30:37,903
We're going to keep
delving into it.

250
00:30:37,905 --> 00:30:39,607
- Thanks, you do that.

251
00:30:43,077 --> 00:30:46,947
Great, just great.

252
00:30:56,558 --> 00:30:59,592
- Two years since the
Brotherhood of Darkness massacre

253
00:30:59,594 --> 00:31:02,160
and questions still remain.

254
00:31:02,162 --> 00:31:03,596
Police have revealed very little

255
00:31:03,598 --> 00:31:05,598
of what they know
about the cult,

256
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,534
and even a bigger
mystery still remains.

257
00:31:08,536 --> 00:31:11,870
Who killed Messiah
Ward and his followers

258
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:13,173
on that fateful night?

259
00:31:14,308 --> 00:31:15,610
We may never know.

260
00:31:59,353 --> 00:32:00,187
- No, no.

261
00:32:02,322 --> 00:32:05,056
- My children,
my flock, welcome.

262
00:32:05,058 --> 00:32:09,595
We have been gathered here
for our final sacrifice,

263
00:32:09,597 --> 00:32:13,599
as our master calls
us to a darker place.

264
00:32:13,601 --> 00:32:17,304
Our shaman has seen
it in a vision.

265
00:32:18,573 --> 00:32:22,174
We have been prosecuted
through the ages

266
00:32:22,176 --> 00:32:24,309
for our service to our Lord.

267
00:32:24,311 --> 00:32:27,247
Burned at the stake by infidels.

268
00:32:29,082 --> 00:32:33,287
Now the time has arrived
for our firey transition.

269
00:32:35,022 --> 00:32:36,089
Do not fear.

270
00:32:37,124 --> 00:32:39,424
Do not fear-
- No!

271
00:32:39,426 --> 00:32:41,729
- The Brotherhood
of Darkness shall reign.

272
00:32:59,246 --> 00:33:03,383
Drink the life giving fluid
as the hour draws near.

273
00:33:05,419 --> 00:33:07,522
- No, no, no.

274
00:33:37,417 --> 00:33:41,255
- We welcome your
cold embrace, oh Master.

275
00:33:42,389 --> 00:33:45,691
- No!

276
00:33:45,693 --> 00:33:48,628
- I warn
you, do not interfere.

277
00:34:22,195 --> 00:34:23,529
- Hello?

278
00:34:23,531 --> 00:34:25,130
This is Father Thomas.

279
00:34:25,132 --> 00:34:26,534
- I'm sorry
to call you so late,

280
00:34:28,168 --> 00:34:29,702
but we need to talk.

281
00:34:29,704 --> 00:34:32,372
- Yes, yes we do.

282
00:34:59,734 --> 00:35:02,537
- Okay, Father
Thomas, let's talk.

283
00:35:04,371 --> 00:35:06,674
Why don't you tell me what you
know that can help my case?

284
00:35:08,208 --> 00:35:10,241
These weren't accidents
we're dealing with.

285
00:35:10,243 --> 00:35:11,646
I'm calling it homicide.

286
00:35:13,548 --> 00:35:14,481
- You have every right to.

287
00:35:16,183 --> 00:35:17,150
- What's
your take on this?

288
00:35:18,553 --> 00:35:20,153
- You want to know the truth?

289
00:35:21,756 --> 00:35:24,759
Even if it questions everything
about the world around you?

290
00:35:26,628 --> 00:35:29,427
- I wouldn't expect someone in
your profession to lie to me.

291
00:35:29,429 --> 00:35:30,665
Yes, the truth.

292
00:35:32,499 --> 00:35:35,637
- What you, what we are
facing, is an evil force.

293
00:35:37,137 --> 00:35:40,173
An evil that has
lived on beyond death,

294
00:35:40,908 --> 00:35:42,407
and it's here now.

295
00:35:42,409 --> 00:35:43,876
- What we are dealing with?

296
00:35:43,878 --> 00:35:47,749
- Yes, you because it
affects you directly,

297
00:35:49,349 --> 00:35:51,719
and I, because of my
actions, it's here.

298
00:35:53,921 --> 00:35:56,423
- You're not making much
sense, Father Thomas.

299
00:35:59,292 --> 00:36:01,929
- Do you remember
the Brotherhood of
Darkness incident?

300
00:36:03,497 --> 00:36:05,767
- Of course, it
was headline news.

301
00:36:06,834 --> 00:36:09,336
But they're long gone, right?

302
00:36:10,738 --> 00:36:12,571
- The Death of Messiah Ward.

303
00:36:12,573 --> 00:36:14,207
The massacre of the cult.

304
00:36:15,409 --> 00:36:17,510
I had something to do with that.

305
00:36:17,512 --> 00:36:20,178
- You were involved
in the massacre?

306
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:24,585
- Yes, I, and I
alone am responsible

307
00:36:25,953 --> 00:36:27,820
for the demise of
that death cult.

308
00:36:27,822 --> 00:36:30,758
Before you tell the police,
we need to finish this.

309
00:36:32,627 --> 00:36:35,293
I will accept moral and legal
ramifications for my actions.

310
00:36:35,295 --> 00:36:39,598
- Well, a lot of folks might
see what you did as a favor,

311
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,500
not a crime.

312
00:36:41,602 --> 00:36:43,569
- It is what it is.

313
00:36:43,571 --> 00:36:46,605
I will answer to
God for my actions.

314
00:36:46,607 --> 00:36:49,476
But we must put a
stop to this, now.

315
00:36:50,812 --> 00:36:52,747
- Why don't you start
at the beginning?

316
00:36:54,882 --> 00:36:59,352
- Messiah Ward was my brother,
both men of the cloth.

317
00:37:00,988 --> 00:37:05,258
Look how we turned out, a
monster and a fallen priest.

318
00:37:06,627 --> 00:37:10,464
He, my brother, wanted
the ultimate power.

319
00:37:12,232 --> 00:37:14,432
Found what he was looking
for in Satan's palm.

320
00:37:14,434 --> 00:37:15,837
He enticed others to join him.

321
00:37:17,672 --> 00:37:20,405
And soon they were committing
despicable acts in his name.

322
00:37:20,407 --> 00:37:23,542
I had to put a stop before
it went any further.

323
00:38:36,349 --> 00:38:38,886
- We've been
expecting you, old friend.

324
00:38:47,562 --> 00:38:50,461
Do what you came here to do.

325
00:39:26,901 --> 00:39:28,002
- Relish in hell

326
00:39:29,537 --> 00:39:31,539
and enjoy your journey
to the dark abyss.

327
00:39:41,816 --> 00:39:42,984
So there you have it.

328
00:39:43,951 --> 00:39:44,819
That's how it went down.

329
00:39:45,853 --> 00:39:47,655
- Hm, okay.

330
00:39:49,489 --> 00:39:53,027
Assuming I believe you, which
I'm not certain I really do.

331
00:39:54,427 --> 00:39:56,061
- It's hard to swallow, I admit.

332
00:39:56,063 --> 00:39:57,064
- What can we do?

333
00:39:58,132 --> 00:40:00,431
How can we put this to rest?

334
00:40:00,433 --> 00:40:02,603
- The derelict building
at Lodger's Point.

335
00:40:04,105 --> 00:40:05,738
- Yeah?

336
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:08,574
We chase partying kids
from there twice a week.

337
00:40:08,576 --> 00:40:10,011
- That was their sanctuary.

338
00:40:11,045 --> 00:40:12,179
We must consecrate it

339
00:40:13,748 --> 00:40:15,848
so Messiah can never
go in there again.

340
00:40:15,850 --> 00:40:17,482
- What do you mean?

341
00:40:17,484 --> 00:40:18,684
- We must bless it
with the hand of God

342
00:40:18,686 --> 00:40:20,152
and make it pure again

343
00:40:20,154 --> 00:40:21,656
so he can never step
foot in there, ever.

344
00:40:22,657 --> 00:40:24,189
- You sure about that?

345
00:40:24,191 --> 00:40:25,059
- Positive.

346
00:40:26,594 --> 00:40:28,095
- And what if we don't find him?

347
00:40:29,664 --> 00:40:30,998
- He'll find us.

348
00:40:32,867 --> 00:40:36,502
- It is not exactly known when
Messiah Ward brought his cult

349
00:40:36,504 --> 00:40:38,170
to Wellsboro, Pennsylvania.

350
00:40:38,172 --> 00:40:41,573
Some estimates put his arrival
at about a decade earlier.

351
00:40:41,575 --> 00:40:42,977
But other reports do claim

352
00:40:44,545 --> 00:40:46,612
that he placed his roots
as early as the 1980s.

353
00:40:46,614 --> 00:40:49,715
Regardless, the Satanic church
has valued their privacy,

354
00:40:49,717 --> 00:40:53,719
though some residents
have feared rumors

355
00:40:53,721 --> 00:40:56,657
of strange cult activity in
the surrounding area of woods.

356
00:40:57,792 --> 00:40:59,758
We'll keep you updated.

357
00:41:25,086 --> 00:41:27,152
- You might wanna
slow it down a bit.

358
00:41:27,154 --> 00:41:29,657
I'd hate to have to write
you a speeding ticket.

359
00:41:31,491 --> 00:41:34,093
- I thought your authority
extended to the water only.

360
00:41:34,095 --> 00:41:35,730
- Just slow it down, okay?

361
00:41:42,236 --> 00:41:44,803
You just put in an Amazon order?

362
00:41:44,805 --> 00:41:45,740
- Our weapons.

363
00:41:47,108 --> 00:41:48,809
- Hm, I have my
weapon right here.

364
00:41:51,712 --> 00:41:53,214
- That gun will do you no good.

365
00:42:45,099 --> 00:42:46,732
- What about the big cross?

366
00:42:46,734 --> 00:42:48,333
- That'll be our last resort.

367
00:42:48,335 --> 00:42:49,904
This will do in the meantime.

368
00:42:51,272 --> 00:42:52,871
We're gonna have to grab
a few of these items.

369
00:42:52,873 --> 00:42:53,741
Holy water.

370
00:42:55,076 --> 00:42:56,944
Quickest and easiest
way to drive away evil.

371
00:42:57,845 --> 00:42:59,278
Cross.

372
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:01,180
Evil can't stand the
sight of a cross.

373
00:43:01,182 --> 00:43:02,249
Take a few of these.

374
00:43:04,251 --> 00:43:06,085
- You're really serious.

375
00:43:06,087 --> 00:43:09,590
- You don't understand the
magnitude of what is before us.

376
00:43:10,991 --> 00:43:13,892
I implore you, heed my
words and stay strong.

377
00:43:13,894 --> 00:43:15,763
- Okay, okay, I'm with you.

378
00:43:17,164 --> 00:43:21,202
But if all else fails,
I'm using my religion.

379
00:43:22,736 --> 00:43:24,369
- And like I said,
it'll do you no good.

380
00:43:24,371 --> 00:43:25,206
- We'll see.

381
00:44:09,316 --> 00:44:11,118
The Brotherhood doesn't
clean much, do they?

382
00:44:27,334 --> 00:44:28,934
You certainly know
your way around here.

383
00:44:28,936 --> 00:44:30,671
- Please stop talking.

384
00:44:56,130 --> 00:44:59,831
This is the epicenter of evil,

385
00:44:59,833 --> 00:45:03,402
the sacrificial room of the
Brotherhood of Darkness.

386
00:45:03,404 --> 00:45:05,940
Few have been here and
lived to talk about it.

387
00:45:07,741 --> 00:45:10,244
- Well, it's not much to
write home about either way.

388
00:45:16,116 --> 00:45:19,384
So do I just stand
here and look pretty?

389
00:45:19,386 --> 00:45:22,087
- You're lucky you
haven't been called upon

390
00:45:22,089 --> 00:45:23,424
to do anything, yet.

391
00:45:25,125 --> 00:45:26,860
- I don't like
how you said that.

392
00:45:38,305 --> 00:45:43,277
- Oh Father in heaven,
hear my prayer.

393
00:45:45,145 --> 00:45:48,880
I place myself at the
foot of your cross

394
00:45:48,882 --> 00:45:53,887
and ask you to cover me
with your precious blood

395
00:45:55,289 --> 00:45:57,525
which flows forth from
your most sacred heart

396
00:45:58,792 --> 00:46:00,227
and from your most holy wounds.

397
00:46:01,795 --> 00:46:03,230
Cleanse me Jesus, in
your most holy water.

398
00:46:05,065 --> 00:46:09,303
I ask you to surround me Lord
Jesus, with your holy light.

399
00:46:11,105 --> 00:46:14,806
Heavenly Father, with the
healing waters of my baptism,

400
00:46:14,808 --> 00:46:19,813
now flow back through
the maternal and
paternal generations

401
00:46:21,148 --> 00:46:23,417
to purify the evil
line of Satan and sin.

402
00:46:24,852 --> 00:46:26,251
I come before you, Father,

403
00:46:26,253 --> 00:46:29,121
and I ask forgiveness
for myself,

404
00:46:29,123 --> 00:46:31,959
my relatives, and my ancestors.

405
00:46:33,494 --> 00:46:37,431
For any powers that set
themselves in opposition to you

406
00:46:39,266 --> 00:46:44,002
or that do not offer true
honor to Lord Jesus Christ.

407
00:46:44,004 --> 00:46:48,175
I now reclaim any territory
that was handed over to Satan

408
00:46:49,977 --> 00:46:52,210
and place it under the
Lordship of Jesus Christ.

409
00:46:52,212 --> 00:46:54,848
By the power of
your Holy Spirit,

410
00:46:56,483 --> 00:47:00,354
I bind all evil spirits
of the air, water, ground,

411
00:47:01,422 --> 00:47:03,924
underground, and nether world.

412
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:10,331
In the holy name of Jesus,
I seal myself, my relatives,

413
00:47:11,865 --> 00:47:14,435
this building and
all sources of supply

414
00:47:15,969 --> 00:47:18,571
in the precious love
of Jesus Christ.

415
00:47:18,573 --> 00:47:20,174
In the holy name of Jesus

416
00:47:21,576 --> 00:47:23,442
I break and dissolve
any and all curses,

417
00:47:23,444 --> 00:47:28,449
hexes, spells, snares,
traps, lies, obstacles,

418
00:47:30,284 --> 00:47:33,588
deceptions, diversions,
spiritual influences,
evil wishes,

419
00:47:35,189 --> 00:47:39,491
evil desires, hereditary
seals known and unknown,

420
00:47:39,493 --> 00:47:44,096
and every dysfunction and
disease from any source

421
00:47:44,098 --> 00:47:45,633
including my mistakes and sins.

422
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:49,167
I sever the transmission of any

423
00:47:49,169 --> 00:47:52,940
and all Satanic vows,
pacts, spiritual bonds,

424
00:47:54,007 --> 00:47:56,009
soul ties, and satanic works.

425
00:47:56,910 --> 00:47:58,343
In Jesus' name,

426
00:47:58,345 --> 00:48:00,245
I break and dissolve
any and all links

427
00:48:00,247 --> 00:48:04,084
and effects of links with
the evil, Messiah Ward,

428
00:48:05,452 --> 00:48:08,453
his followers, and any
blackness that lingers.

429
00:48:08,455 --> 00:48:10,088
I bind it.

430
00:48:10,090 --> 00:48:12,226
Make it so, amen.

431
00:48:16,397 --> 00:48:17,264
- That's it?

432
00:48:18,666 --> 00:48:20,968
I thought it would
be more dramatic.

433
00:48:28,142 --> 00:48:29,274
- What the hell?

434
00:48:29,276 --> 00:48:31,546
- Hell is exactly what it is.

435
00:48:41,155 --> 00:48:42,622
- They don't die.

436
00:48:42,624 --> 00:48:44,692
- You can't kill
what's already dead.

437
00:48:45,959 --> 00:48:46,958
- Now what?

438
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:48,929
- We use God to help us.

439
00:49:02,042 --> 00:49:03,511
A little help here!

440
00:49:04,978 --> 00:49:06,546
Use the holy water!

441
00:49:06,548 --> 00:49:07,547
Do it!

442
00:49:16,524 --> 00:49:18,192
Use the holy water.

443
00:49:21,995 --> 00:49:23,261
We got one more task.

444
00:49:23,263 --> 00:49:24,131
Quickly.

445
00:49:54,762 --> 00:49:58,065
- You know, up until now, I
thought you were full of crap,

446
00:49:59,466 --> 00:50:01,634
but now I'm inclined
to believe you.

447
00:50:01,636 --> 00:50:04,737
- He won't be able to enter
this structure anymore

448
00:50:04,739 --> 00:50:06,338
and defile it with his evil.

449
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:08,340
- Hmm, this Messiah Ward.

450
00:50:08,342 --> 00:50:11,476
He sounds as if he isn't
going to take this lightly.

451
00:50:11,478 --> 00:50:14,479
- Now he can only
roam the lake waters.

452
00:50:14,481 --> 00:50:18,450
We've made a small victory, but
he still has the upper hand.

453
00:50:18,452 --> 00:50:20,087
- I don't like how that sounds.

454
00:51:09,671 --> 00:51:11,303
What's wrong?

455
00:51:11,305 --> 00:51:13,405
He at least has to
stick to the water.

456
00:51:13,407 --> 00:51:14,642
We'll have another chance.

457
00:51:15,710 --> 00:51:16,844
- Tired, my friend.

458
00:51:19,079 --> 00:51:22,249
- Well, this is what you
were called to do, right?

459
00:51:24,084 --> 00:51:27,755
- At seminary we were taught
about evil in it's basic form.

460
00:51:29,089 --> 00:51:30,656
But this evil is greater

461
00:51:30,658 --> 00:51:32,392
than any head diocese
could bear to battle.

462
00:51:33,761 --> 00:51:35,528
- Can we get help
from the church?

463
00:51:35,530 --> 00:51:38,332
You know, an army of
spiritual warriors?

464
00:51:39,534 --> 00:51:41,232
- I'm afraid not.

465
00:51:41,234 --> 00:51:42,668
- Why?

466
00:51:42,670 --> 00:51:45,236
You guys do exorcisms
and stuff like that.

467
00:51:45,238 --> 00:51:46,574
Why is this any different?

468
00:51:48,275 --> 00:51:50,578
- If I were, I'd have
to reveal my actions,

469
00:51:52,446 --> 00:51:54,714
and that's an even greater
evil in the church's eyes.

470
00:51:54,716 --> 00:51:56,414
- You
did them a favor.

471
00:51:56,416 --> 00:51:57,750
- Murder is murder.

472
00:51:57,752 --> 00:51:59,252
There's no distinction
in God's eyes.

473
00:52:00,622 --> 00:52:02,857
- Well, maybe you
have God all wrong.

474
00:52:04,525 --> 00:52:05,392
- How so?

475
00:52:06,326 --> 00:52:09,160
- Maybe, just maybe,

476
00:52:09,162 --> 00:52:12,531
it was in his plans for you
to be the advocate for good

477
00:52:12,533 --> 00:52:15,737
and erase this mess
despite what you had to do.

478
00:52:17,304 --> 00:52:19,137
- You think it's God's plan

479
00:52:19,139 --> 00:52:21,473
I was supposed to murder
Messiah Ward and his acolytes?

480
00:52:21,475 --> 00:52:25,176
- Hmm, erase, not murder, erase.

481
00:52:25,178 --> 00:52:27,647
- Maybe you should
join the clergy.

482
00:52:27,649 --> 00:52:28,516
- Hmm, no.

483
00:52:30,217 --> 00:52:32,350
I swear too much
and drink too much.

484
00:52:32,352 --> 00:52:34,352
- We all have our vices.

485
00:52:34,354 --> 00:52:35,621
Well, let's go.

486
00:52:35,623 --> 00:52:36,724
We'll be safe for now.

487
00:53:20,467 --> 00:53:22,335
- Now let's figure
out our next move.

488
00:53:23,738 --> 00:53:25,907
Hey, easy on the
the sauce, boss.

489
00:53:26,974 --> 00:53:28,273
- Another to clear my head.

490
00:53:28,275 --> 00:53:29,443
- And soak your soul.

491
00:53:42,389 --> 00:53:46,726
So now that the
boating barbarian is
relegated to the water,

492
00:53:46,728 --> 00:53:49,329
how do we send him to
the bottom for good?

493
00:53:51,498 --> 00:53:52,466
- Send him to the bottom?

494
00:53:53,433 --> 00:53:54,867
- Well yes.

495
00:53:54,869 --> 00:53:56,236
Think of Messiah
Ward as a vessel.

496
00:53:57,304 --> 00:53:58,539
How do you disable a vessel?

497
00:53:59,907 --> 00:54:02,510
You scuttle it or send
it to the watery bottom.

498
00:54:03,578 --> 00:54:06,547
- Hmm, excellent thought.

499
00:54:07,615 --> 00:54:08,683
That'd make a good sermon.

500
00:54:10,417 --> 00:54:12,685
If you could scuttle a
vessel, how would you do that?

501
00:54:12,687 --> 00:54:17,322
- Puncture its hull,
burn it, blow it up.

502
00:54:17,324 --> 00:54:18,325
They all would work.

503
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:21,560
- What, what if Messiah escaped,

504
00:54:21,562 --> 00:54:22,997
he didn't go downward the ship?

505
00:54:24,599 --> 00:54:25,465
- Possibly.

506
00:54:27,434 --> 00:54:31,637
Wait, when you put that
cross on the door earlier,

507
00:54:31,639 --> 00:54:33,973
couldn't we do the
same to Messiah Ward?

508
00:54:33,975 --> 00:54:36,441
- Latch a cross, a large one,

509
00:54:36,443 --> 00:54:38,944
to him and send
him to the bottom?

510
00:54:38,946 --> 00:54:40,679
That could work.

511
00:54:40,681 --> 00:54:42,480
Embracing the sign of the cross,

512
00:54:42,482 --> 00:54:43,818
he would be put to the end.

513
00:54:45,653 --> 00:54:47,987
- He's not just going to
let us tie a cross to him

514
00:54:47,989 --> 00:54:49,855
and dunk him in the lake.

515
00:54:49,857 --> 00:54:53,493
- No, but spontaneity
is our upper hand.

516
00:54:54,662 --> 00:54:55,528
- Just like that, huh?

517
00:54:55,530 --> 00:54:56,396
- Have faith.

518
00:54:57,765 --> 00:54:59,432
- I think I'll have
another drink instead.

519
00:56:54,815 --> 00:56:56,081
- Are we all set?

520
00:56:56,083 --> 00:56:57,484
- God be with us.

521
00:57:17,505 --> 00:57:18,637
- Let me guess.

522
00:57:18,639 --> 00:57:19,206
I don't even have to ask.

523
00:57:20,775 --> 00:57:22,910
He'll find us, we
won't find him.

524
00:57:24,211 --> 00:57:25,112
- Precisely.

525
00:57:26,681 --> 00:57:27,615
Keep your eyes peeled.

526
00:57:54,642 --> 00:57:57,076
- Police are currently
investigating reports

527
00:57:57,078 --> 00:57:59,011
of a black boat traveling
at unsafe speeds

528
00:57:59,013 --> 00:58:00,846
in Ness Muck Lake.

529
00:58:00,848 --> 00:58:03,549
It is striper season
here in lovely Wellsboro,

530
00:58:03,551 --> 00:58:08,556
and fishermen and women can
be seen dotting the waterways

531
00:58:09,890 --> 00:58:11,657
in hopes of landing
one of our prized fish.

532
00:58:11,659 --> 00:58:14,893
Please, you're doing any kind

533
00:58:14,895 --> 00:58:16,996
of recreational
activity on the water,

534
00:58:16,998 --> 00:58:20,566
exercise caution
and consideration

535
00:58:20,568 --> 00:58:23,237
for our local and
visiting anglers.

536
00:58:26,140 --> 00:58:27,806
- Hey Radcliff,
where are the sodas?

537
00:58:32,146 --> 00:58:33,614
What died in here?

538
00:58:34,648 --> 00:58:35,647
- Shut up, man.

539
00:58:35,649 --> 00:58:36,648
They're right there.

540
00:58:36,650 --> 00:58:37,516
Open up your eyes.

541
00:58:37,518 --> 00:58:37,918
- Oh, thanks.

542
00:58:39,553 --> 00:58:41,186
- Dude, it stinks.

543
00:58:41,188 --> 00:58:42,189
I'm going outside.

544
00:59:13,220 --> 00:59:14,789
- Hey, did you see that?

545
00:59:15,823 --> 00:59:16,690
- What?

546
00:59:18,059 --> 00:59:20,626
- A, a boat.

547
00:59:20,628 --> 00:59:22,061
- So what?

548
00:59:22,063 --> 00:59:23,195
A boat.

549
00:59:23,197 --> 00:59:26,000
- It just, it just...

550
00:59:26,934 --> 00:59:28,801
- Just what?

551
00:59:28,803 --> 00:59:31,038
- Jed, it just appeared
like a mirage or something.

552
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:36,911
- Yeah, that's it,
Radcliff, mirage.

553
00:59:38,279 --> 00:59:39,914
- Well, I'm gonna
go check it out.

554
00:59:41,248 --> 00:59:43,082
- Yeah, you do that.

555
00:59:43,084 --> 00:59:44,349
You just do that.

556
00:59:44,351 --> 00:59:45,786
I'm gonna rest right here.

557
01:00:13,981 --> 01:00:14,849
- Hello?

558
01:00:15,783 --> 01:00:17,017
Hey, is anyone in there?

559
01:00:18,619 --> 01:00:19,653
Hello in there.

560
01:00:23,023 --> 01:00:24,058
Anybody there?

561
01:00:26,260 --> 01:00:28,129
That ain't very neighborly like.

562
01:00:39,073 --> 01:00:40,875
Damn, that's hot!

563
01:00:44,812 --> 01:00:46,311
No, no!

564
01:00:52,653 --> 01:00:54,021
- Where'd that idiot get to?

565
01:01:01,228 --> 01:01:02,096
Oh.

566
01:01:10,004 --> 01:01:12,004
Idiot fell asleep.

567
01:01:12,006 --> 01:01:13,672
Better drag him back to shore

568
01:01:13,674 --> 01:01:16,210
before he washes out to
see and drowns himself.

569
01:02:00,154 --> 01:02:02,221
Radcliff, get up, you idiot,

570
01:02:02,223 --> 01:02:05,226
before your sorry washes out
into the lake and you drown.

571
01:02:15,169 --> 01:02:17,037
What the hell is that?

572
01:02:21,008 --> 01:02:22,274
Hey!

573
01:02:22,276 --> 01:02:23,477
Hey, slow down!

574
01:03:15,095 --> 01:03:18,032
- So why did you decide to
eliminate the cult on your own?

575
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:21,033
- No one was willing to help.

576
01:03:21,035 --> 01:03:23,268
- I know you said the
diocese wouldn't assist,

577
01:03:23,270 --> 01:03:25,804
but what about local
law enforcement?

578
01:03:25,806 --> 01:03:27,272
- Did it ever occur to you

579
01:03:27,274 --> 01:03:29,941
that maybe some of the
high ranking officials

580
01:03:29,943 --> 01:03:32,311
were part of the
Brotherhood of Darkness?

581
01:03:32,313 --> 01:03:33,879
- Yeah, that would explain

582
01:03:33,881 --> 01:03:36,250
all of the job vacancies
a few years back.

583
01:03:37,851 --> 01:03:39,484
I still think what
you did was right.

584
01:03:39,486 --> 01:03:42,923
Had I busted in there that
night, I would've done the same.

585
01:03:43,991 --> 01:03:45,492
- Thanks, that's reassuring.

586
01:03:47,328 --> 01:03:49,928
I guess we'll figure it
all out on the other side.

587
01:03:49,930 --> 01:03:50,831
- That's deep.

588
01:03:54,435 --> 01:03:55,901
What does it want?

589
01:03:55,903 --> 01:03:57,871
- Messiah Ward's challenging us.

590
01:03:59,273 --> 01:04:01,609
- Then let's catch his
and send him to hell.

591
01:05:39,674 --> 01:05:41,339
It's disappeared.

592
01:05:41,341 --> 01:05:43,041
- He's lured us out into
the middle of the lake.

593
01:05:43,043 --> 01:05:44,943
He has something planned.

594
01:05:44,945 --> 01:05:45,946
Stay alert.

595
01:05:47,181 --> 01:05:48,248
- The time has come.

596
01:05:53,320 --> 01:05:54,319
- Let's finish this.

597
01:05:54,321 --> 01:05:55,657
Come on, Messiah Ward!

598
01:06:16,578 --> 01:06:19,010
- Name of God, be gone!

599
01:06:33,427 --> 01:06:34,428
- It's over.

600
01:06:35,362 --> 01:06:37,262
- It appears it is.

601
01:06:47,174 --> 01:06:49,341
Latch him to me quickly!

602
01:06:49,343 --> 01:06:50,342
- But-

603
01:06:50,344 --> 01:06:52,145
- There's no other way!

604
01:06:57,384 --> 01:06:58,753
I'll see you on the other side.

605
01:07:00,287 --> 01:07:02,655
And you, you're going to hell!

606
01:09:17,659 --> 01:09:19,558
- You forgot these.
