184

run him down with my dogs.

220
00:19:50,088 --> 00:19:53,023
I found a strange medallion
among Ben's belongings.

221
00:19:54,025 --> 00:19:58,121
Yes, Saint Columbanus.
He was an Eastern saint.

222
00:19:58,497 --> 00:20:00,260
He was also a gypsy.

223
00:20:01,066 --> 00:20:03,728
So did Ben have dealings
with the gypsies?

224
00:20:06,238 --> 00:20:10,607
Yes, he was our negotiator.

225
00:20:11,209 --> 00:20:12,938
The local gentry
would pay a fee,

226
00:20:13,044 --> 00:20:16,741
and the gypsies would keep
their criminal activities
to a minimum.

227
00:20:17,616 --> 00:20:23,111
