1
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:23,943
<i>I never dreamed
that the life of my grandsons...</i>

2
00:01:24,283 --> 00:01:27,150
<i>which began with such love and comfort...</i>

3
00:01:27,787 --> 00:01:31,052
<i>would turn to see
so much violence and bloodshed.</i>

4
00:01:35,594 --> 00:01:39,189
<i>This is their story, as it was told to me.</i>

5
00:02:10,196 --> 00:02:11,959
We should disappear.

6
00:02:14,867 --> 00:02:17,700
Go someplace where we can see everything.

7
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:23,040
Let me see your knife.

8
00:02:24,276 --> 00:02:26,710
Can I carve my name in your face?

9
00:03:39,251 --> 00:03:41,378
You goddamn son of a bitch!

10
00:03:44,957 --> 00:03:46,185
Chris!

11
00:04:48,887 --> 00:04:49,979
God!

12
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:16,547
Brandy, get over here. Come here!

13
00:05:49,915 --> 00:05:51,246
He's getting away.

14
00:05:51,316 --> 00:05:53,648
That son of a bitch
broke my goddamn window!

15
00:05:53,719 --> 00:05:55,050
Calm down.

16
00:06:28,854 --> 00:06:30,913
You angry about something?

17
00:06:33,025 --> 00:06:34,083
No.

18
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:44,263
He said that he...

19
00:06:45,337 --> 00:06:47,669
has just about had it with you.

20
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:52,138
You want the truth?

21
00:06:52,945 --> 00:06:56,312
I think you pushed your old man
just about as far as you can push him.

22
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:06,558
<i>I drive down here once a week
to bail your ass out of some mess.</i>

23
00:07:06,625 --> 00:07:09,719
<i>I don't want to hear your excuse.
Go on outside and get in the car.</i>

24
00:07:09,795 --> 00:07:10,819
<i>Just wait.</i>

25
00:07:10,896 --> 00:07:13,057
What? What am I waiting for, buddy?

26
00:07:13,565 --> 00:07:16,227
You gonna collect yourself,
show me some respect?

27
00:07:16,301 --> 00:07:17,461
What's it gonna take, Chris?

28
00:07:17,536 --> 00:07:19,766
- I'm not going!
- I said, get in the goddamn car.

29
00:07:25,144 --> 00:07:27,078
Today was supposed to be
about your brother.

30
00:07:27,146 --> 00:07:29,671
It's his birthday. It's not about you.

31
00:07:34,052 --> 00:07:36,418
Bad enough we're waiting
with our party hats on...

32
00:07:36,488 --> 00:07:39,355
to get a call like that,
how do you think that makes Tim feel?

33
00:07:39,424 --> 00:07:40,413
It's all right, Dad.

34
00:07:42,494 --> 00:07:44,428
No, it's not all right.

35
00:07:44,596 --> 00:07:47,429
Don't you care about anybody but yourself?

36
00:07:59,611 --> 00:08:02,808
<i>...searching for an escaped inmate
after yesterday's prison break...</i>

37
00:08:02,881 --> 00:08:05,315
<i>at the County Penitentiary.</i>

38
00:08:05,384 --> 00:08:09,013
<i>Two guards were stripped and killed
in the incident following the riot.</i>

39
00:08:09,087 --> 00:08:10,714
<i>In college basketball...</i>

40
00:08:41,186 --> 00:08:43,245
You can forget about
that girlfriend of yours.

41
00:08:43,322 --> 00:08:46,314
Duck out on your responsibility again,
I'll bury you alive.

42
00:08:46,391 --> 00:08:48,916
- You never let me leave this place.
- You wanna leave?

43
00:08:48,994 --> 00:08:52,054
- You wanna leave this place?
- We can't even have friends!

44
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:55,156
What kind of birthday is it
with just the three of us?

45
00:08:55,267 --> 00:08:57,792
It's like we're being locked up,
and for what?

46
00:08:58,403 --> 00:09:00,928
What are you afraid we're gonna do?

47
00:09:48,854 --> 00:09:51,254
I'm sorry I ruined your birthday.

48
00:09:52,524 --> 00:09:55,755
I thought my birthday party
would be a lot of fun.

49
00:09:57,529 --> 00:10:01,329
You and Dad and me,
we'd all have a good time.

50
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:05,768
But it didn't happen like that.

51
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,871
Before you know it...

52
00:10:11,109 --> 00:10:12,770
things you say...

53
00:10:14,913 --> 00:10:16,813
nobody's gonna listen.

54
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:20,775
I know what you feel.

55
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,581
You're just a kid.

56
00:10:27,092 --> 00:10:29,083
Enjoy it while it lasts.

57
00:10:30,696 --> 00:10:33,529
<i>Now I'd like to introduce a special trio.</i>

58
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:37,835
<i>The Rebecca Trio have come,
and have a song...</i>

59
00:10:37,903 --> 00:10:42,033
<i>about what wonderful grace
the Lord Jesus Christ gives us to live with.</i>

60
00:10:45,877 --> 00:10:49,108
<i>I feel the touch</i>

61
00:10:49,181 --> 00:10:53,675
<i>Of hands so kind and tender</i>

62
00:10:53,752 --> 00:10:56,983
<i>They're leading me</i>

63
00:10:57,155 --> 00:11:01,114
<i>In paths that I must trod</i>

64
00:11:01,393 --> 00:11:04,328
<i>I'll have no fear</i>

65
00:11:04,496 --> 00:11:08,489
<i>When Jesus walks beside me</i>

66
00:11:09,034 --> 00:11:12,731
<i>For I'm sheltered in</i>

67
00:11:12,804 --> 00:11:15,272
<i>The arms of God</i>

68
00:11:15,507 --> 00:11:19,307
<i>So let the storms rage high</i>

69
00:11:19,378 --> 00:11:21,676
<i>The dark clouds rise</i>

70
00:11:21,747 --> 00:11:24,307
<i>They don't worry me</i>

71
00:11:24,383 --> 00:11:27,375
<i>For I'm sheltered safe</i>

72
00:11:27,486 --> 00:11:32,446
<i>Within the arms of God</i>

73
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:36,219
<i>He walks with me</i>

74
00:11:36,361 --> 00:11:40,491
<i>And none other shall harm me</i>

75
00:11:40,599 --> 00:11:44,365
<i>For I'm sheltered in</i>

76
00:11:44,536 --> 00:11:47,266
<i>The arms of God</i>

77
00:11:58,216 --> 00:11:59,183
Chris.

78
00:12:02,187 --> 00:12:04,985
I'm going into town. I won't be back till late.

79
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:08,419
- Where's Tim at?
- I don't know.

80
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:13,194
- You put salt water in the feed?
- Yeah, but I can't do all this by myself.

81
00:12:13,265 --> 00:12:16,428
Why don't you send Tim out here
to help for once?

82
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:20,134
He's no good at work.

83
00:12:20,572 --> 00:12:22,472
Not much for strength.

84
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:26,000
I'm gonna have some of his birthday cake.

85
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:30,879
Not until you're done working here.
There's a lot to be done.

86
00:12:56,675 --> 00:12:58,905
It won't work. It won't blow.

87
00:13:13,892 --> 00:13:16,326
- Got a hole in your foot.
- I know.

88
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:20,395
It smells.

89
00:13:24,736 --> 00:13:27,637
Can I stick my finger in it? In the hole?

90
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:29,364
No.

91
00:13:29,908 --> 00:13:33,002
I would just wiggle it around,
it would be cool.

92
00:16:24,382 --> 00:16:26,179
You're up awful late.

93
00:16:27,385 --> 00:16:28,477
Dad?

94
00:16:29,854 --> 00:16:30,980
Yeah.

95
00:16:34,659 --> 00:16:36,092
You're home.

96
00:16:38,463 --> 00:16:40,090
I'm pretty beat.

97
00:16:43,001 --> 00:16:46,801
I know I've been hard on you, Chris,
but you know I love you.

98
00:16:51,576 --> 00:16:56,343
You must have looked pretty classic
with that board sticking out of your foot.

99
00:16:56,514 --> 00:16:58,345
Wished I'd seen that.

100
00:16:59,818 --> 00:17:01,080
It hurt.

101
00:17:04,222 --> 00:17:05,917
It hurt like crap.

102
00:17:10,161 --> 00:17:13,653
Sometimes it's the strange moments
that stick with you.

103
00:17:19,471 --> 00:17:21,268
I'm gonna go to bed.

104
00:17:26,911 --> 00:17:28,538
Good night, Dad.

105
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:53,260
Tim, wake up.

106
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,953
It's a gift.

107
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:20,695
I like it.

108
00:19:08,913 --> 00:19:11,040
<i>You're trying to... Don't spit on me!</i>

109
00:19:11,115 --> 00:19:15,518
I'm tired of looking at your head.
Come up here and bring me some nails.

110
00:19:15,787 --> 00:19:17,914
I don't like being up there.

111
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:20,355
Who's that?

112
00:19:35,106 --> 00:19:36,767
I think I'm lost.

113
00:19:37,642 --> 00:19:39,667
Does John Munn live here?

114
00:19:40,945 --> 00:19:44,210
- He's somewhere.
- Who are you, little man?

115
00:19:44,415 --> 00:19:47,009
He's here. Dad!

116
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:50,178
Can I help you?

117
00:19:50,588 --> 00:19:51,680
John?

118
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:55,254
Put that booger down, brother,
and come give me a kiss.

119
00:19:56,394 --> 00:19:59,420
Well, I'll be. Deel.

120
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:02,693
It's a shocker, ain't It?

121
00:20:02,934 --> 00:20:04,526
I found you.

122
00:20:06,337 --> 00:20:07,770
These yours?

123
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,566
Yeah.

124
00:20:12,443 --> 00:20:13,842
Come on in.

125
00:20:20,218 --> 00:20:23,676
- That Dad's brother?
- Never seen him before.

126
00:20:23,755 --> 00:20:26,781
- You like his car?
- Shut up.

127
00:20:31,162 --> 00:20:32,891
What are you doing?

128
00:20:33,464 --> 00:20:36,262
Organizing my books by the way they smell.

129
00:20:39,203 --> 00:20:41,569
<i>This one's about a guy...</i>

130
00:20:44,542 --> 00:20:47,477
Thought a lot about you, I got to say, Deel.

131
00:20:49,981 --> 00:20:53,041
Yeah, well, I never did get
no valentines, John.

132
00:20:56,154 --> 00:20:59,180
I didn't know if you'd want
to hear from me...

133
00:21:00,892 --> 00:21:04,384
the way you blamed me for things.
Don't say you didn't.

134
00:21:06,998 --> 00:21:08,260
I won't.

135
00:21:13,771 --> 00:21:15,762
Then when Audrey died...

136
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:21,037
I just couldn't bear it.

137
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:23,670
Took the kids out of school,
didn't tell nobody.

138
00:21:23,748 --> 00:21:26,342
Moved out here to live
in the sticks like hermits.

139
00:21:27,719 --> 00:21:29,084
<i>Because people...</i>

140
00:21:30,321 --> 00:21:33,848
Sort of no reminders
when you tear away from people.

141
00:21:42,734 --> 00:21:44,668
I couldn't handle it...

142
00:21:46,537 --> 00:21:49,267
the thought of you stuck in that place.

143
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,374
I was gonna go see you.

144
00:21:52,076 --> 00:21:55,239
I even made plans, but I didn't. I just...

145
00:21:55,313 --> 00:21:57,781
You don't gotta say nothing, John.

146
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:01,277
I feel like if I forgive...

147
00:22:02,353 --> 00:22:04,378
then I'll be forgiven.

148
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:10,823
Lice gets everywhere.

149
00:22:12,797 --> 00:22:14,196
Stay still.

150
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:16,224
Was she pretty?

151
00:22:17,001 --> 00:22:18,366
- Who?
- Mom.

152
00:22:20,705 --> 00:22:23,902
She was kind of good-looking,
I guess, for a mom.

153
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:28,035
She had a little moustache, though.

154
00:22:28,279 --> 00:22:31,112
I always thought that was weird for a lady.

155
00:22:31,315 --> 00:22:33,647
I remember her kind of perfume.

156
00:22:36,387 --> 00:22:38,912
- You wanna smell my armpit?
- No.

157
00:22:43,127 --> 00:22:45,152
I wanna get me a haircut.

158
00:22:46,197 --> 00:22:48,631
What are you gonna do now?
Got any plans?

159
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,428
- I always got plans.
- Here, wear that.

160
00:22:51,502 --> 00:22:53,629
Long as I stay in the state, I'm good.

161
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:56,799
Check in with the parole officer
every once in a while.

162
00:22:56,874 --> 00:22:58,705
I got some masonry work lined up...

163
00:22:58,776 --> 00:23:02,007
Watch your step there.
Tim's got a rough stomach.

164
00:23:10,655 --> 00:23:12,486
Got to admit, John...

165
00:23:13,324 --> 00:23:16,555
you look like you're doing
all right for yourself.

166
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:19,720
We're doing well enough.

167
00:23:21,399 --> 00:23:22,423
We really are.

168
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:27,130
I sold all six hogs to this Korean farmer
last week, just to clear the place out.

169
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:32,871
I've been looking for a good man
to keep up around here.

170
00:23:32,944 --> 00:23:37,313
I got some work at this little taxidermy shop.
It's way out in Bilton.

171
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:42,351
Tell you what, why don't you stick around
till your work starts?

172
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:43,853
You could...

173
00:23:46,324 --> 00:23:48,087
be a help to me.

174
00:23:50,428 --> 00:23:51,827
How's that?

175
00:23:53,264 --> 00:23:55,596
Well, those kids are a handful.

176
00:24:00,671 --> 00:24:03,970
Tim's got health problems.
They're getting serious.

177
00:24:05,843 --> 00:24:09,335
And when I'm gone, I worry
Chris is gonna get into trouble...

178
00:24:09,413 --> 00:24:11,574
and not take care of his responsibility.

179
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:14,079
Seems like every time I turn around...

180
00:24:14,152 --> 00:24:16,620
the cops got him picked him up
for something or other.

181
00:24:16,888 --> 00:24:20,688
<i>Breaking windows...
He popped this kid in the face with a rake.</i>

182
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,955
Then he breaks into a church.

183
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:30,230
The preacher finds him asleep on the altar,
drunk on wine.

184
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:37,570
I could use another pair of eyes
around here.

185
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:42,272
I couldn't pay you, but you get
a roof over your head, and I'll feed you.

186
00:24:45,583 --> 00:24:48,950
That way me and you could spend
some time together, like you said.

187
00:24:49,253 --> 00:24:50,777
I'd like that.

188
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:54,554
It's all the same to me.

189
00:24:57,328 --> 00:24:59,853
A chicken ain't nothing but a bird.

190
00:25:01,899 --> 00:25:03,833
Remember them old Mexican gold coins...

191
00:25:03,901 --> 00:25:06,665
Dad stole from that museum
when we was kids?

192
00:25:07,271 --> 00:25:11,674
He always said when he died,
you and me should split up the worth...

193
00:25:13,911 --> 00:25:16,175
and treat ourselves like kings.

194
00:25:19,584 --> 00:25:23,315
When he died, they raided this place.
They took everything.

195
00:25:26,023 --> 00:25:28,583
They even took those old Indian ashtrays.

196
00:25:30,928 --> 00:25:33,260
Old man was a hell of a pirate.

197
00:25:35,032 --> 00:25:36,966
But the worst taste in art.

198
00:25:41,105 --> 00:25:42,800
I like them boots.

199
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:46,673
They're pretty cool.

200
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,370
You're cool.

201
00:25:53,784 --> 00:25:56,753
<i>I don't think he's got anyplace else to stay.</i>

202
00:25:59,323 --> 00:26:02,190
He's gonna stay with us for a little while.

203
00:26:02,793 --> 00:26:04,693
We'll see how it goes.

204
00:26:06,397 --> 00:26:08,058
What are you doing?

205
00:26:15,206 --> 00:26:17,538
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.

206
00:26:17,608 --> 00:26:20,236
Y'all sleep tight. I'm gonna hit it.

207
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:22,375
It's good to be here.

208
00:26:22,713 --> 00:26:24,112
Good night.

209
00:26:25,383 --> 00:26:29,444
<i>Oh, this here's the boat I've hoped for</i>

210
00:26:30,621 --> 00:26:33,522
<i>Oh, land, please pardon me</i>

211
00:26:33,958 --> 00:26:36,586
That's a song my father used to sing.

212
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:41,494
I haven't heard that in years.

213
00:27:24,742 --> 00:27:26,232
What's wrong?

214
00:27:26,844 --> 00:27:30,041
<i>I'm just... I'm scared of the way
you make me feel.</i>

215
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:35,919
- I think I might be too young for my head.
- I didn't touch you.

216
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:42,656
It's your dad, right?

217
00:27:44,662 --> 00:27:46,926
I don't know what we're doing.

218
00:27:55,406 --> 00:27:57,738
I care about you, Chris, but...

219
00:27:59,043 --> 00:28:00,305
I can't.

220
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:11,143
Hot enough for you?

221
00:29:14,251 --> 00:29:16,719
It ain't the heat that gets to me.

222
00:29:17,388 --> 00:29:18,685
It's the stupidity.

223
00:29:18,756 --> 00:29:21,122
Goddamn, this is a beautiful land.

224
00:29:28,599 --> 00:29:31,568
I used to take days like this for granted.

225
00:29:35,072 --> 00:29:37,063
We've had a lot of rain.

226
00:29:37,875 --> 00:29:39,308
So it's like...

227
00:29:40,478 --> 00:29:42,002
all this life.

228
00:29:42,847 --> 00:29:46,305
It's like living in a fishbowl.
That's what it's like.

229
00:29:46,617 --> 00:29:47,675
What?

230
00:29:49,186 --> 00:29:53,623
I said it's like living in a fishbowl,
being stuck here like a workhorse.

231
00:29:55,025 --> 00:29:57,755
Must get kind of cramped being a slave.

232
00:29:58,162 --> 00:30:00,926
Me, I gotta get away now and then.
What about you?

233
00:30:05,603 --> 00:30:07,434
God, I love to drive.

234
00:30:08,439 --> 00:30:10,236
Has he changed much?

235
00:30:10,474 --> 00:30:13,500
- From when y'all were kids?
- Old John?

236
00:30:13,577 --> 00:30:15,875
No, he's pretty much the same.

237
00:30:16,013 --> 00:30:19,278
He's got a few silly new fur coats,
kind of queer.

238
00:30:20,951 --> 00:30:23,749
Did you know my mom?

239
00:30:23,854 --> 00:30:26,618
I knew your mom first. She was my girl.

240
00:30:27,958 --> 00:30:31,121
He didn't mention
that little detail, though, huh?

241
00:30:31,195 --> 00:30:33,527
No, I shouldn't think he would.

242
00:30:33,764 --> 00:30:36,028
What did he tell you about me?

243
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:43,299
He said you were in prison.

244
00:30:43,741 --> 00:30:47,006
- You got a girlfriend?
- Not really.

245
00:30:47,878 --> 00:30:48,970
That's smart, boy.

246
00:30:49,346 --> 00:30:52,645
You gotta live a little first.
Girls mess with your head.

247
00:30:52,716 --> 00:30:54,707
Make you do crazy things.

248
00:30:58,055 --> 00:30:59,955
Did you hurt somebody?

249
00:31:03,894 --> 00:31:06,658
You wanna drive? I'll work the gearshift.

250
00:31:07,231 --> 00:31:09,699
- Nah.
- Somebody better take the wheel.

251
00:31:09,767 --> 00:31:11,234
- Better take the wheel.
- No!

252
00:31:11,302 --> 00:31:15,170
Come on, champ. Take it.
Somebody better take the wheel, kiddo.

253
00:31:18,943 --> 00:31:20,672
Shit, yeah!

254
00:31:27,985 --> 00:31:30,180
I forgot what it feels like.

255
00:31:30,287 --> 00:31:31,914
What feels like?

256
00:31:35,192 --> 00:31:36,750
Are you scared?

257
00:32:00,918 --> 00:32:02,977
Here, Tim, try some sweet potatoes.

258
00:32:03,621 --> 00:32:04,849
Tim don't eat much.

259
00:32:04,922 --> 00:32:07,152
What, is he afraid he'll get fat or something?

260
00:32:07,224 --> 00:32:11,058
He's already got a bunch of cellulite.
Look at all that goop.

261
00:32:11,762 --> 00:32:13,559
It's about affinity.

262
00:32:14,298 --> 00:32:16,459
Doctor says his brain ain't ready for it.

263
00:32:16,533 --> 00:32:18,763
- It's an anxiety disorder.
- Freaks out his ulcer.

264
00:32:18,836 --> 00:32:20,895
It's called an anxiety disorder.

265
00:32:20,971 --> 00:32:23,337
Take your hat off at the table.
It ain't Thanksgiving.

266
00:32:23,407 --> 00:32:26,672
When I was a boy,
I used to worry about Pilgrims.

267
00:32:26,744 --> 00:32:29,440
I had this nightmare
that a whole bunch of you bastards...

268
00:32:29,513 --> 00:32:31,743
would bust into my room
with your shirts off...

269
00:32:31,815 --> 00:32:33,874
and you'd tickle me crazy.

270
00:32:34,084 --> 00:32:38,418
You'd make me walk the plank
or eat turkey until I got fat.

271
00:32:39,156 --> 00:32:41,989
You'd force me to just eat and eat.

272
00:32:42,993 --> 00:32:46,121
Till all of a sudden
I realized I was an animal.

273
00:32:47,097 --> 00:32:49,224
An animal eating an animal.

274
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:52,060
Then I'd wake up with a start...

275
00:32:52,936 --> 00:32:55,234
and find I'd pissed my pajamas.

276
00:32:58,509 --> 00:33:02,673
It is kind of funny now.
It wasn't so funny then.

277
00:33:02,746 --> 00:33:04,646
How much work did you guys
get done today?

278
00:33:04,715 --> 00:33:06,342
Not as much as we hoped.

279
00:33:08,018 --> 00:33:10,851
We had to run into town, get some supplies.

280
00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:14,819
Come on, now. Dish up.

281
00:33:15,426 --> 00:33:17,257
Y'all say grace?

282
00:33:17,728 --> 00:33:20,663
Occasionally. Feel free.

283
00:33:20,831 --> 00:33:23,891
Thank you for this food.
Hope everybody has a nice time. Amen.

284
00:33:23,967 --> 00:33:26,435
- Hallelujah.
- I want a leg.

285
00:33:30,007 --> 00:33:31,872
Supplies in town, huh?

286
00:33:32,976 --> 00:33:37,242
Well, tell you the truth,
Chris wanted to take a ride in my car...

287
00:33:37,848 --> 00:33:42,444
and I could've said no, but I didn't want
to get off on the wrong foot with him.

288
00:33:42,519 --> 00:33:44,146
You went driving?

289
00:33:44,521 --> 00:33:46,751
I get home and nothing's done.

290
00:33:48,225 --> 00:33:51,456
You're sure right about them two.
They ain't exactly fond of work.

291
00:33:51,528 --> 00:33:55,692
I kept having to stop what I was doing
to go and track them down.

292
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,366
Don't put it all on the boys, Deel.

293
00:33:59,436 --> 00:34:03,202
That's not what we agreed on.
You're supposed to look after them.

294
00:34:03,273 --> 00:34:07,039
I'm just trying to give the kids
some elbow room.

295
00:34:08,345 --> 00:34:11,075
We were not exactly angels
when we were their age, John.

296
00:34:11,148 --> 00:34:13,548
That's right.

297
00:34:15,686 --> 00:34:17,779
You don't trust me, do you?

298
00:34:18,822 --> 00:34:23,020
- Lf you want me to leave, just say so.
- No.

299
00:34:29,933 --> 00:34:33,630
For the longest time out here,
just me and the boys, I was sure...

300
00:34:34,471 --> 00:34:36,496
I'd made a wreck of things.

301
00:34:38,308 --> 00:34:40,105
You know what I mean?

302
00:34:40,878 --> 00:34:43,210
I just wanted us to be a family.

303
00:34:43,947 --> 00:34:46,279
Well, anyhow, now you're here.

304
00:34:48,385 --> 00:34:50,512
Maybe I got a second chance.

305
00:34:51,054 --> 00:34:53,522
- Let's not mess it up.
- Okay.

306
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,955
- Are you gonna eat that?
- What?

307
00:34:58,028 --> 00:35:01,327
- That.
- No, go on. Help yourself.

308
00:35:05,769 --> 00:35:07,760
Big old piece of gristle.

309
00:35:12,042 --> 00:35:14,033
Hurry up. Dad wants you.

310
00:35:15,479 --> 00:35:16,503
Hi.

311
00:35:26,423 --> 00:35:27,515
Yeah?

312
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:29,517
Dad?

313
00:35:31,995 --> 00:35:34,725
Remember when we had
that painting made?

314
00:35:35,332 --> 00:35:39,860
Had to stand still, without sleeping.
It took a night and a day.

315
00:35:40,938 --> 00:35:42,303
What did I do now?

316
00:36:02,593 --> 00:36:03,719
Fuck.

317
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:25,914
So I hear you just had a birthday.

318
00:36:26,884 --> 00:36:28,977
How old does that make you?

319
00:36:29,186 --> 00:36:30,676
- Ten years old.
- Ten.

320
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:37,555
Well, you're a heck of a lot smarter
than most 10-year-olds I know.

321
00:36:38,262 --> 00:36:40,389
That is a sharp-looking jet.

322
00:36:40,964 --> 00:36:43,057
- Chris made it by hand.
- Damn nice.

323
00:36:46,803 --> 00:36:50,534
You're daddy's got
a lot of real nice things, too, don't he?

324
00:36:52,943 --> 00:36:54,433
You know, when I was your age...

325
00:36:54,511 --> 00:36:58,607
my daddy, he had a collection
of old Mexican coins.

326
00:36:59,249 --> 00:37:02,150
He used to let me and John
play with them sometimes.

327
00:37:02,319 --> 00:37:04,378
They were solid gold.

328
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:06,455
Dad has some like that.

329
00:37:08,091 --> 00:37:09,490
I knew that.

330
00:37:11,795 --> 00:37:16,755
You know, your granddaddy,
he gave them to John and me, his two sons.

331
00:37:18,068 --> 00:37:21,435
Your dad, he probably just forgot
that half are mine.

332
00:37:22,806 --> 00:37:24,899
Where does he keep them at?

333
00:37:25,642 --> 00:37:27,166
Keeps them hid.

334
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:29,106
Well, where does he hide them at?

335
00:37:29,179 --> 00:37:30,669
It's a secret.

336
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:35,215
Well, see, I'm family
and I'm pretty good at keeping secrets.

337
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:39,681
It's a secret from me, too.

338
00:37:40,257 --> 00:37:41,747
You don't say?

339
00:37:53,337 --> 00:37:55,202
You shouldn't do that.

340
00:37:56,840 --> 00:38:00,241
You shouldn't open a can like that.
You'll bust your knife blade.

341
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:03,842
What are you doing?

342
00:38:03,947 --> 00:38:08,475
I found your stack of nudie books
in a chest under a rock back here.

343
00:38:09,586 --> 00:38:13,147
- You got good taste.
- That stuff ain't mine.

344
00:38:13,357 --> 00:38:15,382
I ain't gonna say nothing.

345
00:38:16,093 --> 00:38:19,392
I ain't got no business
busting in on dirty secrets.

346
00:38:20,530 --> 00:38:23,226
Besides, me and you is friends.
Ain't that right?

347
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:28,702
- That's right.
- Yeah.

348
00:38:29,339 --> 00:38:32,069
I never had all the advantages like John.

349
00:38:34,344 --> 00:38:37,177
I got the leavings and was told to like it.

350
00:38:39,182 --> 00:38:42,618
I see the way your daddy
looks at your little brother.

351
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:45,449
You know there's something.

352
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:50,024
He sees himself.
Like looking in a goddamn mirror.

353
00:38:51,294 --> 00:38:52,921
Then there's you.

354
00:38:54,698 --> 00:38:57,189
You're just one of his little pigs.

355
00:38:57,668 --> 00:38:59,465
A hole in the ground.

356
00:39:03,073 --> 00:39:04,734
I like you, Chris.

357
00:39:05,308 --> 00:39:07,105
You don't play games.

358
00:39:10,447 --> 00:39:14,508
Don't ever let the same dog bite you twice.
You know what I mean?

359
00:39:23,827 --> 00:39:26,489
- Knock-knock.
- Who's there?

360
00:39:26,563 --> 00:39:28,360
- Interrupting cow.
- Interrupting-cow who?

361
00:39:28,432 --> 00:39:29,524
Moo!

362
00:39:37,307 --> 00:39:38,968
It doesn't work.

363
00:39:40,877 --> 00:39:43,209
You've got the wrong tool.

364
00:39:45,415 --> 00:39:48,384
Did you and Uncle Deel fight a lot
when you were kids?

365
00:39:48,585 --> 00:39:51,611
We had our problems...

366
00:39:51,688 --> 00:39:54,657
but our dad didn't put up
with too much nonsense.

367
00:39:54,958 --> 00:39:58,485
He was nice too, right?
He gave you that treasure.

368
00:39:59,262 --> 00:40:03,062
You mean those coins? That's right, he did.

369
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:06,528
You know those coins ain't ordinary coins?

370
00:40:06,603 --> 00:40:08,161
What do you mean?

371
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:13,137
- It's a long story.
- It's from pirates?

372
00:40:13,410 --> 00:40:17,847
No, not exactly. Do you know about Charon,
the ferryman of the dead?

373
00:40:20,217 --> 00:40:23,914
According to a legend,
when you pass into the realm of the dead...

374
00:40:23,987 --> 00:40:27,946
your spirit has to pay passage
to cross the river Styx into Hades.

375
00:40:28,091 --> 00:40:32,221
You have to pay Charon.
He's the ferryman. He's this winged demon.

376
00:40:32,529 --> 00:40:35,054
The price, one gold coin per soul.

377
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:38,593
If you don't have a coin...

378
00:40:38,668 --> 00:40:42,604
then you're condemned to wander
the banks of the river for 100 years.

379
00:40:42,672 --> 00:40:44,162
Like in hell?

380
00:40:47,677 --> 00:40:48,701
No.

381
00:40:49,746 --> 00:40:51,213
Just waiting.

382
00:40:54,151 --> 00:40:57,678
<i>A long time ago,
my father went for a walk to the river.</i>

383
00:40:57,754 --> 00:41:02,418
At the ferry crossing, he sees this old
Mexican ferryman, all dressed in rags...

384
00:41:03,593 --> 00:41:07,222
pays him a nickel, crosses over,
doesn't think much of it.

385
00:41:07,364 --> 00:41:10,424
When he gets home,
he reaches his hand in his pocket...

386
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:14,334
and pulls out a gold coin
that hadn't been there before.

387
00:41:14,971 --> 00:41:18,407
But my dad couldn't stop thinking
about that poor man.

388
00:41:19,409 --> 00:41:21,843
How much food that coin would buy.

389
00:41:22,379 --> 00:41:25,280
So the next day, he crosses the river again.

390
00:41:26,249 --> 00:41:28,444
<i>He gives the man a gold coin.</i>

391
00:41:28,785 --> 00:41:31,811
The man thanks him
and takes him across the river.

392
00:41:31,888 --> 00:41:35,051
But when he got home, he reaches in...

393
00:41:35,692 --> 00:41:38,058
and now he's got two gold coins.

394
00:41:38,295 --> 00:41:40,991
Same thing happened the next day,
and the day after:

395
00:41:41,064 --> 00:41:42,463
Five coins.

396
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:46,533
Then 10, and 20 and 40. On and on.

397
00:41:46,603 --> 00:41:48,730
His pockets grew fat.

398
00:41:50,407 --> 00:41:52,204
Then one day, the river dried up...

399
00:41:52,275 --> 00:41:54,675
the ferryman was gone
and never came back.

400
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:59,378
My dad said he thought that was Charon.

401
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:02,516
<i>And that he was paying the living...</i>

402
00:42:03,019 --> 00:42:04,384
<i>what he kept from the dead.</i>

403
00:42:04,454 --> 00:42:08,288
<i>That's why I saved them all this time.
Those coins are cursed.</i>

404
00:42:10,193 --> 00:42:12,787
They're the debt the dead had to pay.

405
00:42:13,964 --> 00:42:18,401
If they're worth so much, why don't you
just sell them so we can get rich?

406
00:42:18,668 --> 00:42:21,034
I pawned one off last year
to buy that station wagon.

407
00:42:21,104 --> 00:42:24,870
You see what a pain in the ass that's been,
it went to prove my point.

408
00:42:25,475 --> 00:42:27,102
<i>There are demons.</i>

409
00:42:28,845 --> 00:42:31,336
And they got a sick sense of humor.

410
00:42:34,417 --> 00:42:38,012
Go on, now. Get washed up, you sculp.

411
00:42:40,056 --> 00:42:42,081
Dad, why was Deel in jail?

412
00:42:51,968 --> 00:42:54,198
Before our parents died...

413
00:42:56,506 --> 00:42:59,202
he got some bad news that upset him.

414
00:43:02,012 --> 00:43:03,912
It was something I did.

415
00:43:05,382 --> 00:43:07,247
I let my brother down.

416
00:43:08,485 --> 00:43:10,453
But I'm not proud of it.

417
00:43:12,289 --> 00:43:14,621
He came to find me for a reason.

418
00:43:46,856 --> 00:43:48,585
What are you doing?

419
00:43:51,528 --> 00:43:53,655
Dressing up in your clothes.

420
00:43:54,097 --> 00:43:55,826
Pretending I'm you.

421
00:43:56,766 --> 00:43:59,326
Your boots are a little
too big, though, honestly.

422
00:44:00,370 --> 00:44:04,807
- I thought things were good between us.
- You lied to me, John. I knew it.

423
00:44:05,075 --> 00:44:08,169
Always twisting things around
so you come out on top.

424
00:44:08,478 --> 00:44:12,073
I show up and you got a second chance?
Well, I never had a first chance.

425
00:44:12,148 --> 00:44:14,776
You and the old man saw to that.

426
00:44:15,085 --> 00:44:19,488
First my girl, now my money.
Everything that belongs to me is here.

427
00:44:20,924 --> 00:44:22,482
Don't bring Audrey into this.

428
00:44:22,625 --> 00:44:26,186
You brought her into it.
When I was pinned down.

429
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:30,163
When I walk into my own bedroom
and see you with my girl.

430
00:44:30,233 --> 00:44:32,201
Seen you with her, John!

431
00:44:32,769 --> 00:44:34,236
That's right.

432
00:44:35,372 --> 00:44:37,897
She's an old case and you won, John.

433
00:44:38,508 --> 00:44:41,671
But Chris is my son
and you've always known that.

434
00:44:43,613 --> 00:44:45,376
Get out of my house.

435
00:44:48,084 --> 00:44:50,109
I can't let this go, John.

436
00:44:53,189 --> 00:44:57,489
- I'm not gonna stand here and listen to this.
- That's because you never listen.

437
00:44:58,328 --> 00:45:00,091
You never listen to me.

438
00:45:01,931 --> 00:45:03,660
As for what I did, we were young.

439
00:45:03,733 --> 00:45:06,167
I'm sorry. Is that what you want me to say?

440
00:45:06,236 --> 00:45:07,635
I want my money.

441
00:45:07,704 --> 00:45:10,639
Put those coins down.
You think that's gonna make it better?

442
00:45:12,308 --> 00:45:14,674
Those coins are greed, Deel.

443
00:45:14,911 --> 00:45:17,744
It's your own greed
you're trying to disguise.

444
00:45:18,448 --> 00:45:20,609
You're scared of this world.

445
00:45:20,784 --> 00:45:23,844
You think if you hide everything,
it'll be easy.

446
00:45:28,091 --> 00:45:30,992
Don't ever hit me again. You hear me?

447
00:46:14,404 --> 00:46:16,065
Son of a bitch!

448
00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:33,111
No!

449
00:47:42,058 --> 00:47:43,389
Open it.

450
00:47:47,830 --> 00:47:49,354
Come here.

451
00:47:51,868 --> 00:47:53,495
What's happening?

452
00:47:57,307 --> 00:47:58,934
Is it Uncle Deel?

453
00:48:18,361 --> 00:48:19,726
Let's move.

454
00:48:20,196 --> 00:48:21,720
What about Dad?

455
00:49:18,354 --> 00:49:19,981
He's out there...

456
00:49:22,258 --> 00:49:23,725
somewhere.

457
00:49:25,762 --> 00:49:26,786
Go.

458
00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:35,638
Let's go out the back.

459
00:49:42,712 --> 00:49:43,804
Dad!

460
00:50:19,382 --> 00:50:20,474
Hell!

461
00:50:23,986 --> 00:50:26,955
- Out the window! Come on!
- I can't, Chris. It's too high.

462
00:50:27,023 --> 00:50:31,187
Yes, you can! It's in your head. Quick.
Climb down the ladder. Come on. Get down.

463
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:32,989
- Are you coming?
- Just go.

464
00:50:33,329 --> 00:50:34,728
I can't!

465
00:51:05,128 --> 00:51:06,925
This is how it looks.

466
00:51:07,730 --> 00:51:09,664
Nobody knows I'm here.

467
00:51:11,901 --> 00:51:14,768
The law already has an opinion of you.

468
00:51:16,305 --> 00:51:18,170
And it's your knife...

469
00:51:19,575 --> 00:51:21,475
that killed my brother.

470
00:51:22,912 --> 00:51:24,641
It's a pity, too.

471
00:51:25,114 --> 00:51:26,979
You and I was friends.

472
00:51:30,787 --> 00:51:32,721
Chris!

473
00:52:03,686 --> 00:52:04,880
Get in!

474
00:52:14,297 --> 00:52:16,026
I can't drive stick.

475
00:52:16,265 --> 00:52:17,789
The coins!

476
00:52:20,303 --> 00:52:21,998
Give me those.

477
00:52:22,839 --> 00:52:24,602
Get out. Move!

478
00:52:25,741 --> 00:52:27,003
His keys.

479
00:52:31,714 --> 00:52:33,113
Come on!

480
00:53:57,333 --> 00:53:59,392
Are we gonna tell the police?

481
00:53:59,468 --> 00:54:01,732
He's got my knife and my fingerprints.

482
00:54:05,708 --> 00:54:07,699
Cops will think I did it.

483
00:54:20,356 --> 00:54:23,450
Everybody's looking for a reason
to put me away.

484
00:54:38,908 --> 00:54:40,170
You okay?

485
00:54:42,945 --> 00:54:44,537
Did he hurt you?

486
00:54:46,182 --> 00:54:47,206
No.

487
00:54:53,789 --> 00:54:55,279
We got nobody.

488
00:54:57,526 --> 00:54:59,391
Where are we gonna go?

489
00:55:01,697 --> 00:55:03,665
We'll shave our heads...

490
00:55:03,866 --> 00:55:06,460
grow beards and only speak Apache.

491
00:55:06,602 --> 00:55:08,069
I don't know.

492
00:55:10,106 --> 00:55:12,006
We should go to Mexico.

493
00:55:12,541 --> 00:55:14,202
Gold's good there.

494
00:55:19,081 --> 00:55:21,914
We can't sell them. It's bad luck.

495
00:55:26,522 --> 00:55:28,922
I'll take all the luck I can get.

496
00:56:26,882 --> 00:56:28,281
I got an idea.

497
00:56:29,385 --> 00:56:30,613
Come on.

498
00:56:39,395 --> 00:56:40,726
Excuse us!

499
00:56:43,632 --> 00:56:47,762
If you need any work done,
we'll give you a hand for a bite to eat.

500
00:57:39,789 --> 00:57:41,051
Nice hat.

501
00:57:48,697 --> 00:57:49,789
Boys!

502
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:53,024
Lunch is ready.

503
00:57:54,370 --> 00:57:56,998
Okay, y'all. Eat some of this shit.

504
00:58:08,184 --> 00:58:10,152
You want to hear a joke?

505
00:58:10,486 --> 00:58:12,613
It's a Mexican weather joke.

506
00:58:13,122 --> 00:58:15,556
What's the weather like in Mexico?

507
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:18,493
Chili today, hot tamale.

508
00:58:22,364 --> 00:58:24,559
- Aw, come on...
- You and your jokes!

509
00:58:24,633 --> 00:58:27,101
It's a damn funny joke.

510
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:33,536
There's some damn fine food up in here.

511
00:58:33,776 --> 00:58:35,437
Really? Think so?

512
00:58:36,111 --> 00:58:39,638
It's been a long time
since somebody treated us so good.

513
00:58:40,449 --> 00:58:41,780
Thank you.

514
00:58:42,218 --> 00:58:46,985
It's been a long time
since we had some young people...

515
00:58:48,224 --> 00:58:49,623
sit with us.

516
00:58:52,928 --> 00:58:55,158
We're unable to have children.

517
00:59:02,271 --> 00:59:04,762
We had us a little one for a while.

518
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:12,641
A little baby boy.

519
00:59:13,949 --> 00:59:16,179
But he wouldn't take my milk.

520
00:59:19,688 --> 00:59:24,523
I tried and tried, but my breasts
were strangers to him.

521
00:59:25,594 --> 00:59:29,621
What we do now is
we count the blessings that we do have.

522
00:59:31,467 --> 00:59:32,695
My baby.

523
00:59:35,538 --> 00:59:36,630
Amen.

524
00:59:38,474 --> 00:59:40,533
Praise Jesus.

525
00:59:44,113 --> 00:59:46,013
Little man, eat.

526
00:59:47,616 --> 00:59:51,450
Because you don't eat,
you won't be able to grow up like this.

527
01:00:59,555 --> 01:01:00,715
Hello.

528
01:01:06,095 --> 01:01:08,222
You know what Wadsworth did?

529
01:01:09,231 --> 01:01:10,323
What?

530
01:01:10,399 --> 01:01:14,733
Pulled a nickel out of my armpit.
Can't buy much with a nickel.

531
01:01:19,308 --> 01:01:20,935
I like this goat.

532
01:01:32,054 --> 01:01:35,581
You don't look so good
and you didn't hardly eat.

533
01:01:36,158 --> 01:01:38,183
You don't like my cooking?

534
01:01:42,264 --> 01:01:46,598
Now, you boys look exhausted.
Why don't you stay here and rest a while?

535
01:02:28,177 --> 01:02:29,804
My shoulder hurt.

536
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:34,110
That little one looks so sick.

537
01:02:36,752 --> 01:02:38,481
What about my pain?

538
01:02:43,792 --> 01:02:46,022
He said keep an eye on them...

539
01:02:46,895 --> 01:02:48,795
that he'd be here soon.

540
01:02:50,165 --> 01:02:52,156
I hope I done the right thing.

541
01:02:52,234 --> 01:02:53,701
Be all right.

542
01:02:53,869 --> 01:02:57,771
They probably just lost and hungry,
forgot where their home was.

543
01:02:58,173 --> 01:02:59,902
I done that myself.

544
01:03:00,809 --> 01:03:03,073
Where they at, anyway?

545
01:03:03,245 --> 01:03:07,204
- They're in a hammock, resting.
- Out back?

546
01:03:10,385 --> 01:03:12,717
I told him they would be there.

547
01:04:02,971 --> 01:04:04,131
Howdy.

548
01:04:05,474 --> 01:04:06,736
Mr. Pela?

549
01:04:10,045 --> 01:04:11,410
Nice place.

550
01:04:13,015 --> 01:04:14,744
It's a damn nice place you got.

551
01:04:14,817 --> 01:04:16,910
Them boys is pretty smooth.

552
01:04:16,985 --> 01:04:19,215
I ain't surprised
they got one over on you, either.

553
01:04:19,288 --> 01:04:20,550
Didn't take me over.

554
01:04:20,622 --> 01:04:24,752
They ran out this morning when they seen
the workload I had for them.

555
01:04:24,827 --> 01:04:26,021
Really?

556
01:04:28,430 --> 01:04:31,160
- What's wrong?
- Howdy, ma'am. How're you doing?

557
01:04:31,233 --> 01:04:34,430
They're gone. They disappeared.
They ran off.

558
01:04:34,503 --> 01:04:38,269
What you mean, they're gone?
When's the last time you seen them?

559
01:04:38,340 --> 01:04:41,104
- I don't know.
- Did they tell you where they're going?

560
01:04:41,176 --> 01:04:43,940
They said they were
going down to Watertown...

561
01:04:44,012 --> 01:04:45,809
working on the water.

562
01:04:47,115 --> 01:04:50,414
We should call the sheriff.
Get a couple of cars out looking for them.

563
01:04:50,485 --> 01:04:53,818
- They couldn't have got far.
- Don't be calling the sheriff, damn it!

564
01:05:07,436 --> 01:05:09,063
- Tim.
- Yeah?

565
01:05:10,205 --> 01:05:11,866
- Guess what?
- What?

566
01:05:14,343 --> 01:05:16,573
- There's a cow.
- I know.

567
01:05:19,748 --> 01:05:22,182
I want to milk the hell out of it.

568
01:05:46,241 --> 01:05:47,640
Get them up!

569
01:06:23,211 --> 01:06:24,678
I miss Dad...

570
01:06:25,580 --> 01:06:27,241
and the hogs...

571
01:06:27,616 --> 01:06:29,140
and my books...

572
01:06:29,518 --> 01:06:31,179
and my shower cap.

573
01:06:32,120 --> 01:06:33,314
I know.

574
01:06:34,389 --> 01:06:37,950
When Dad died,
you think he got across the river?

575
01:06:40,429 --> 01:06:42,329
We should keep the coins.

576
01:06:42,397 --> 01:06:45,662
Dad might need them
for the ferryman and come back.

577
01:06:50,339 --> 01:06:52,671
I think you might have chiggers.

578
01:06:53,809 --> 01:06:57,404
They're too small to see,
so it's just from the bites.

579
01:06:57,713 --> 01:06:59,704
The bites are really big.

580
01:07:01,550 --> 01:07:03,347
You know, chiggers...

581
01:07:03,618 --> 01:07:08,351
they're, like, the smallest animals on earth
to have such a harmful bite.

582
01:07:08,657 --> 01:07:11,455
<i>They hurt a lot and it's like poison ivy.</i>

583
01:07:13,695 --> 01:07:15,993
<i>I read a book about them...</i>

584
01:07:16,064 --> 01:07:18,259
<i>but it was a long time ago...</i>

585
01:07:18,734 --> 01:07:20,531
<i>and I forget now.</i>

586
01:07:21,203 --> 01:07:24,900
<i>But I do remember that they don't
bite your skin, they just...</i>

587
01:07:24,973 --> 01:07:27,874
<i>Well, they bite your skin,
they don't feed off of it.</i>

588
01:07:27,943 --> 01:07:31,106
<i>They just bite it,
and that's where their nest is...</i>

589
01:07:31,813 --> 01:07:35,442
<i>that little red dot.
And if you smush them, they die.</i>

590
01:07:36,018 --> 01:07:38,680
<i>They're all red, but in the middle,
it's even redder...</i>

591
01:07:38,754 --> 01:07:42,212
<i>like flowers, you know, with the thorns.</i>

592
01:07:44,226 --> 01:07:48,890
<i>But on the outside they're just pink,
like your bumps right there.</i>

593
01:07:55,337 --> 01:07:57,805
<i>If we were like big-size chiggers...</i>

594
01:07:57,873 --> 01:08:01,468
<i>if I bit you, there'd be a big lump
on your head.</i>

595
01:08:01,843 --> 01:08:03,208
<i>Really big.</i>

596
01:08:05,981 --> 01:08:08,882
<i>Because the bites are bigger than they are.</i>

597
01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:14,220
<i>So it would hurt a lot.</i>

598
01:08:16,825 --> 01:08:20,659
<i>If we moved to some country
like Iceland or Nebraska...</i>

599
01:08:23,198 --> 01:08:26,190
<i>...there it's too cold for them,
so we'd be safe.</i>

600
01:08:28,003 --> 01:08:30,631
<i>And they'd all either die or run away.</i>

601
01:08:43,652 --> 01:08:46,587
I couldn't tell if that was a man or a woman.

602
01:08:46,888 --> 01:08:49,516
There are a lot of red ants over here.

603
01:09:17,018 --> 01:09:18,280
Do you like books?

604
01:09:19,121 --> 01:09:20,110
Yup.

605
01:09:22,824 --> 01:09:25,918
<i>The Jinx of Payrock Canyon.
That's a really good book.</i>

606
01:09:26,027 --> 01:09:29,827
<i>It's about this guy who's just going around,
and then he finds this treasure.</i>

607
01:09:29,898 --> 01:09:32,992
<i>And he doesn't know what it is
and he has to go find it.</i>

608
01:09:33,068 --> 01:09:36,401
<i>When he opens it up, it puts a curse on him.</i>

609
01:09:38,840 --> 01:09:41,070
<i>And he avenges the guy...</i>

610
01:09:41,877 --> 01:09:43,902
<i>that put the curse on him.</i>

611
01:10:02,497 --> 01:10:04,465
Nothing personal, Chris.

612
01:10:06,234 --> 01:10:09,328
I've got labor laws to deal with around here.
Labor laws.

613
01:10:09,404 --> 01:10:12,271
They'll take me off in handcuffs
if I hire someone like you.

614
01:10:12,340 --> 01:10:13,932
We have nothing here for you.

615
01:10:14,342 --> 01:10:16,037
I appreciate your stopping by.

616
01:10:18,013 --> 01:10:19,002
Shut up!

617
01:10:35,830 --> 01:10:37,957
- Who was that?
- I don't know.

618
01:10:39,834 --> 01:10:41,961
- What did he want?
- Money.

619
01:10:42,671 --> 01:10:47,233
All I have is the nickel Wadsworth gave me.
So I gave him my book.

620
01:10:47,909 --> 01:10:50,434
- Why did you do that?
- I don't know.

621
01:10:51,646 --> 01:10:53,511
I didn't get that job.

622
01:10:55,217 --> 01:10:58,584
Do they have whores,
I mean horses, in Mexico?

623
01:11:00,855 --> 01:11:02,220
Hell, yeah.

624
01:11:07,696 --> 01:11:09,755
Goddamn it. Shit.

625
01:11:10,665 --> 01:11:11,996
Backwards.

626
01:11:18,873 --> 01:11:21,398
Turn off the goddamn engine, retard.

627
01:11:26,681 --> 01:11:29,479
Hey, man, don't I know you
from someplace?

628
01:11:31,152 --> 01:11:32,744
I don't think so.

629
01:11:32,821 --> 01:11:37,224
Did you ever hear of a singing
and dancing group called "The Historics"?

630
01:11:38,293 --> 01:11:39,726
Look man, I'm in a hurry.

631
01:11:39,794 --> 01:11:43,355
It's kind of like a play on words,
like storks, like the bird...

632
01:11:43,598 --> 01:11:45,361
but "Historics" because they...

633
01:11:45,433 --> 01:11:47,731
Like I said, I'm in a hurry, and this car...

634
01:11:47,802 --> 01:11:50,396
keeps conking out on me
every time I try to get anywhere.

635
01:11:50,472 --> 01:11:53,100
<i>You think you can persuade it
to give me a little more...</i>

636
01:11:53,174 --> 01:11:55,142
It needs torque. You know about...

637
01:11:55,210 --> 01:11:58,668
There was another wreck the other day.

638
01:11:58,813 --> 01:12:02,579
An ice cream truck wiped out on the road.
We had to tow it.

639
01:12:02,651 --> 01:12:04,312
It still had the ice cream in it.

640
01:12:04,586 --> 01:12:07,146
It was melted, but we ate it anyway.

641
01:12:08,556 --> 01:12:11,525
Why are you standing
right behind me, Retardoe?

642
01:12:11,593 --> 01:12:13,390
Go back in the truck.

643
01:12:15,330 --> 01:12:17,127
You ever do any time?

644
01:12:19,501 --> 01:12:21,833
Look, I'm in a hurry.
Where you want me to sit?

645
01:12:21,903 --> 01:12:24,531
I just got out of charm school myself.

646
01:12:24,739 --> 01:12:27,469
- You can sit...
- Can I sit in the back of my car?

647
01:12:27,609 --> 01:12:30,373
You could, but there's always a danger
of a disconnect...

648
01:12:30,445 --> 01:12:31,935
and the car would roll out.

649
01:12:32,013 --> 01:12:35,278
You wouldn't be able to drive it
because it's dead.

650
01:12:35,550 --> 01:12:39,350
- You're coming over here now.
- I ain't sitting in the middle.

651
01:12:39,487 --> 01:12:43,719
Those boots are awesome.
I think they're awesome.

652
01:12:45,060 --> 01:12:47,790
- We can sit in...
- I'll sit in the middle.

653
01:12:47,862 --> 01:12:50,228
There's this one song that The Historics do.

654
01:12:51,399 --> 01:12:53,196
<i>There's a monster in the canyon</i>

655
01:12:53,268 --> 01:12:57,364
<i>Don't you know
That there's a monster in the canyon</i>

656
01:13:36,511 --> 01:13:38,741
Think you'll ever get married?

657
01:13:39,214 --> 01:13:40,681
I don't know.

658
01:13:42,550 --> 01:13:44,245
They look happy...

659
01:13:45,453 --> 01:13:47,387
but you never can tell.

660
01:14:04,973 --> 01:14:06,338
Thank you.

661
01:14:07,742 --> 01:14:08,834
Shit.

662
01:14:13,515 --> 01:14:16,143
You seen two kids hanging around here?

663
01:14:18,420 --> 01:14:20,445
I saw a kid up the street.

664
01:14:21,990 --> 01:14:25,619
Tied his babysitter to a tree
with a thing of barbed wire.

665
01:14:28,196 --> 01:14:30,061
What did he look like?

666
01:14:30,999 --> 01:14:32,762
Just a kid, I guess.

667
01:14:34,569 --> 01:14:36,366
He had a double chin.

668
01:14:37,806 --> 01:14:39,205
Bad sunburn.

669
01:14:45,814 --> 01:14:47,281
What's wrong?

670
01:14:47,782 --> 01:14:49,511
I swallowed my gum.

671
01:14:50,452 --> 01:14:51,544
Shit.

672
01:14:53,121 --> 01:14:56,022
How did you come by
that thing on your face?

673
01:14:59,861 --> 01:15:01,590
I choked on my gum.

674
01:15:04,799 --> 01:15:06,289
Kind of weird.

675
01:15:09,170 --> 01:15:11,798
Got that radiator fixed up
as quick as we could.

676
01:15:11,873 --> 01:15:12,965
Cool.

677
01:15:13,508 --> 01:15:15,339
It should last a good while.

678
01:15:15,710 --> 01:15:18,270
Keep her fervid.

679
01:15:18,346 --> 01:15:19,677
All right.

680
01:15:20,782 --> 01:15:21,840
Bye.

681
01:15:23,051 --> 01:15:26,248
- See you later.
- Thanks again.

682
01:15:30,692 --> 01:15:32,717
What, are you crying now?

683
01:15:33,628 --> 01:15:35,687
What does it look like I'm doing?

684
01:15:35,763 --> 01:15:38,561
Throwing up boogers.

685
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:43,232
I'll give you a booger.
I'll give you a booger right where you...

686
01:15:43,304 --> 01:15:47,400
This is going in your big, fat,
stupid, baby mouth.

687
01:16:04,259 --> 01:16:05,726
Check it out.

688
01:16:05,793 --> 01:16:09,092
The old clerk thought I just went in
to take a leak.

689
01:16:09,797 --> 01:16:11,526
Where are we going?

690
01:16:12,133 --> 01:16:13,623
I'll get work.

691
01:16:15,637 --> 01:16:19,334
We'll get set up and then head south
till we get to Mexico...

692
01:16:21,476 --> 01:16:23,569
go eat cheese or something.

693
01:16:25,780 --> 01:16:27,771
- You want some?
- No.

694
01:16:31,119 --> 01:16:34,953
You got the wrong damn end. Hurry up.
Come on, man!

695
01:16:35,323 --> 01:16:38,190
If I was looking for work out here,
who would I talk to...

696
01:16:38,259 --> 01:16:40,659
like working on boats or whatever?

697
01:16:40,728 --> 01:16:43,322
You can talk to any of these guys
on a boat around here.

698
01:16:43,398 --> 01:16:44,592
If he's got a boat.

699
01:16:44,666 --> 01:16:48,864
I got a crew right now.
If I can get them to work. They won't work.

700
01:16:48,937 --> 01:16:52,668
They stand around jawing their mouth,
talking about hurricanes and stuff.

701
01:16:52,740 --> 01:16:55,675
Let me tell you the truth.
I'm looking for two boys.

702
01:16:55,743 --> 01:16:57,608
My boys, they run out on me.

703
01:16:57,679 --> 01:17:00,170
I figure they might be working out here.
You seen them?

704
01:17:00,248 --> 01:17:02,113
No. What they look like?

705
01:17:02,183 --> 01:17:04,174
A little bit like me, just smaller.

706
01:17:08,756 --> 01:17:10,223
Anybody here?

707
01:17:24,138 --> 01:17:25,628
Anybody here?

708
01:19:18,853 --> 01:19:22,084
I wish we had a knife
so we could kill animals that come around.

709
01:19:22,156 --> 01:19:24,784
You never killed nothing in your life.

710
01:19:28,162 --> 01:19:29,527
A mosquito.

711
01:19:31,599 --> 01:19:34,193
It's not a mosquito. It's a firefly.

712
01:19:36,537 --> 01:19:39,370
There was something
Granddaddy used to say.

713
01:19:41,676 --> 01:19:44,270
Something he told me a long time ago.

714
01:19:45,880 --> 01:19:47,609
He was Mama's dad.

715
01:19:50,151 --> 01:19:52,381
He was walking in the woods...

716
01:19:54,188 --> 01:19:56,281
and there were fireflies.

717
01:19:56,657 --> 01:19:59,182
A bunch of them, blinking off and on.

718
01:20:01,596 --> 01:20:04,121
He called them nature's nightlights.

719
01:20:05,032 --> 01:20:07,933
To help animals find their way in the dark.

720
01:20:11,372 --> 01:20:12,964
Can't keep them.

721
01:20:13,808 --> 01:20:16,299
They need to be able to fly around.

722
01:20:17,979 --> 01:20:20,004
They'll die if they can't.

723
01:20:22,083 --> 01:20:24,779
He had a way to calm me with his words.

724
01:20:24,952 --> 01:20:28,149
I couldn't tell half the time
if he was talking...

725
01:20:28,956 --> 01:20:31,151
or you were reading his mind.

726
01:20:33,561 --> 01:20:35,756
- Why don't we go see him?
- Who?

727
01:20:36,731 --> 01:20:38,528
Granddad and Grandma.

728
01:20:40,101 --> 01:20:42,433
Maybe they don't want us anyhow.

729
01:20:43,337 --> 01:20:45,362
You ever think about that?

730
01:20:52,046 --> 01:20:54,241
They didn't like Dad's style.

731
01:20:55,750 --> 01:20:58,913
And then after Mom died,
they stopped showing up.

732
01:21:51,939 --> 01:21:54,134
She really got a nice voice, though.

733
01:21:54,208 --> 01:21:57,143
She gets the right break,
she'll be here in a hurry.

734
01:21:59,347 --> 01:22:01,076
What year was that?

735
01:22:01,148 --> 01:22:03,946
That was just last year
that this picture was taken.

736
01:22:16,197 --> 01:22:19,394
Her brother is a corporate airplane pilot.

737
01:22:20,868 --> 01:22:23,302
She's 16 and he's about 19. So young.

738
01:22:24,705 --> 01:22:28,072
You love to see young people
like that do so well...

739
01:22:28,142 --> 01:22:30,975
because a lot of them don't.

740
01:22:31,045 --> 01:22:34,173
<i>I did, too. I used to have two...</i>

741
01:22:49,330 --> 01:22:50,388
Tim!

742
01:22:57,872 --> 01:22:59,237
Scoot over.

743
01:23:05,713 --> 01:23:08,511
This is medicine for intestinal problems.

744
01:23:18,926 --> 01:23:20,723
Can you hold it down?

745
01:23:24,532 --> 01:23:26,124
Make you better.

746
01:23:30,738 --> 01:23:33,332
I'm thinking we should stay here for a while.

747
01:23:33,407 --> 01:23:35,637
Just until you get a little better, okay?

748
01:23:36,644 --> 01:23:39,135
Until your medicine starts working.

749
01:23:40,748 --> 01:23:42,716
What does it taste like?

750
01:23:43,684 --> 01:23:45,777
You're getting weak.

751
01:23:45,853 --> 01:23:48,378
If you get weak, you got to tell me.

752
01:23:48,856 --> 01:23:50,585
How's that now?

753
01:23:54,628 --> 01:23:56,095
Is it good?

754
01:23:58,866 --> 01:24:00,891
It's Deel. Move.

755
01:24:01,535 --> 01:24:02,832
This way!

756
01:24:05,106 --> 01:24:06,971
God damn it. Chris!

757
01:24:13,214 --> 01:24:16,741
Why don't you boys come out
and let me look at you?

758
01:24:19,653 --> 01:24:21,416
We're family, right?

759
01:24:22,623 --> 01:24:24,955
Family looks after each other.

760
01:24:26,327 --> 01:24:28,090
Protects each other.

761
01:24:33,034 --> 01:24:35,229
They even forgive each other.

762
01:24:47,248 --> 01:24:49,842
I'm here to ask for your forgiveness.

763
01:25:07,935 --> 01:25:09,095
Chris!

764
01:25:22,783 --> 01:25:25,775
Chris, look what you're putting Tim through.

765
01:25:26,754 --> 01:25:28,619
Running him around.

766
01:25:30,958 --> 01:25:32,926
Let's stop all this.

767
01:26:28,282 --> 01:26:30,375
<i>I was thinking about Dad...</i>

768
01:26:31,785 --> 01:26:33,753
<i>how he spoke to us...</i>

769
01:26:35,089 --> 01:26:37,148
<i>like he was afraid.</i>

770
01:26:39,593 --> 01:26:41,959
When he looked me in the eye...

771
01:26:45,900 --> 01:26:47,299
sometimes...

772
01:26:49,336 --> 01:26:51,964
I believe he had no idea who I was.

773
01:26:56,210 --> 01:26:57,768
Or didn't care.

774
01:27:00,347 --> 01:27:01,974
<i>Who was this kid?</i>

775
01:27:04,185 --> 01:27:06,210
<i>How did he spring from me?</i>

776
01:27:15,729 --> 01:27:18,630
<i>I like the questions you ask yourself.</i>

777
01:27:34,648 --> 01:27:36,309
It's my money.

778
01:27:49,763 --> 01:27:51,890
- Violet, are you okay?
- I am.

779
01:27:51,966 --> 01:27:55,026
He's an asshole.
Can we please get out of here?

780
01:28:01,408 --> 01:28:03,308
- You're bleeding.
- Yeah.

781
01:28:15,823 --> 01:28:17,017
Thanks.

782
01:29:04,938 --> 01:29:06,303
That's Gus.

783
01:29:08,309 --> 01:29:09,571
Hey, Gus.

784
01:29:10,878 --> 01:29:11,936
Hey.

785
01:29:16,250 --> 01:29:18,582
I want, like, a thousand babies.

786
01:29:19,787 --> 01:29:23,587
A whole force of them, so that you're a team
and when you walk anywhere...

787
01:29:23,657 --> 01:29:26,558
people always have to pay attention to you.

788
01:29:27,061 --> 01:29:30,155
<i>But maybe some more boys
than girls, because...</i>

789
01:29:56,457 --> 01:29:58,186
Where are you from?

790
01:30:00,427 --> 01:30:01,655
Nowhere.

791
01:30:12,973 --> 01:30:14,873
He's not doing so good.

792
01:30:18,445 --> 01:30:20,174
He'll fight it off.

793
01:30:21,148 --> 01:30:22,672
He always does.

794
01:30:24,318 --> 01:30:25,410
Here.

795
01:30:49,910 --> 01:30:52,242
You got something to write with?

796
01:30:57,317 --> 01:30:59,842
I met this gypsy once.

797
01:31:04,858 --> 01:31:07,918
She told me that you write down a wish.

798
01:31:07,995 --> 01:31:12,193
Like whatever you want most in the world.
You write it down.

799
01:31:17,438 --> 01:31:18,530
Here.

800
01:31:22,976 --> 01:31:25,274
Don't tell me what it is, okay?

801
01:31:33,620 --> 01:31:35,588
Then you put it in here.

802
01:31:37,491 --> 01:31:39,220
Don't look at mine.

803
01:31:42,963 --> 01:31:44,487
Put it in here.

804
01:31:51,271 --> 01:31:53,000
You see this river?

805
01:31:53,941 --> 01:31:55,738
It goes to the ocean.

806
01:31:55,843 --> 01:31:58,903
And so you throw your bottle in the ocean.

807
01:31:59,012 --> 01:32:01,037
Well, you don't, you throw it in the river...

808
01:32:01,114 --> 01:32:05,016
and if it makes it all the way to the ocean,
then everything comes true.

809
01:32:06,787 --> 01:32:08,254
But a lot can go wrong...

810
01:32:08,322 --> 01:32:12,258
because it could just get pulled down.

811
01:32:13,494 --> 01:32:15,689
Something could pull it down.

812
01:33:09,216 --> 01:33:10,945
Have you seen them?

813
01:33:11,351 --> 01:33:14,946
- I ain't seen them.
- I'll make it worth your while.

814
01:33:25,832 --> 01:33:27,959
Where did you get that book?

815
01:33:32,172 --> 01:33:33,264
Well?

816
01:34:49,216 --> 01:34:52,913
Your bag is right there,
if that's what you're looking for.

817
01:35:10,404 --> 01:35:12,133
What are you doing?

818
01:35:14,608 --> 01:35:16,599
Those belonged to my dad.

819
01:35:16,943 --> 01:35:18,706
They're worth a lot.

820
01:35:19,579 --> 01:35:21,774
I figured you could use them.

821
01:35:32,192 --> 01:35:34,217
I ain't got nowhere to go.

822
01:35:37,497 --> 01:35:40,398
No one to be with me. See?

823
01:35:44,705 --> 01:35:47,037
Where did you say you were from?

824
01:36:05,258 --> 01:36:08,125
I didn't know if I'd ever see you again, Chris.

825
01:36:08,195 --> 01:36:10,390
Gather up them coins, boy.

826
01:36:10,997 --> 01:36:12,157
Do it.

827
01:36:12,766 --> 01:36:16,133
- I said gather up them coins, boy.
- I ain't your boy.

828
01:36:17,738 --> 01:36:19,433
You know, Chris...

829
01:36:22,175 --> 01:36:24,439
your ma and me, we had
some beautiful good times.

830
01:36:24,511 --> 01:36:28,174
- Don't talk about her.
- We had some beautiful nights, boy.

831
01:36:28,248 --> 01:36:31,183
And you were gonna be
our gift to each other.

832
01:36:32,686 --> 01:36:34,017
You don't know nothing!

833
01:36:34,087 --> 01:36:38,524
I know your daddy,
that stranger he always saw in you, Chris...

834
01:36:39,559 --> 01:36:41,823
was because you weren't his.

835
01:36:42,362 --> 01:36:45,991
You're my seed, and he had no right.
No right at all.

836
01:36:47,267 --> 01:36:50,828
Now, let's take them coins
and let's start over, just you and me.

837
01:36:50,904 --> 01:36:52,064
Chris!

838
01:36:58,211 --> 01:36:59,473
Come on.

839
01:37:03,216 --> 01:37:05,047
Tim!

840
01:37:06,119 --> 01:37:07,552
Come on.

841
01:37:18,698 --> 01:37:20,290
Come one, Tim!

842
01:37:21,501 --> 01:37:22,661
Run!

843
01:37:47,060 --> 01:37:48,152
Wait!

844
01:37:50,764 --> 01:37:52,959
Are you okay? Come on!

845
01:37:53,033 --> 01:37:54,523
<i>- I can't.
- He can't. He's too...</i>

846
01:37:54,601 --> 01:37:57,001
You have to keep up. Now go.

847
01:37:57,537 --> 01:37:58,765
- Come on.
- Hide!

848
01:38:13,787 --> 01:38:16,221
Here, stay down, okay? Keep still.

849
01:38:17,057 --> 01:38:18,319
I'll get help.

850
01:38:19,593 --> 01:38:20,821
Come on.

851
01:38:24,297 --> 01:38:25,889
You want this?

852
01:38:31,538 --> 01:38:33,802
Just hand them to me, Chris.

853
01:38:35,175 --> 01:38:36,870
Nobody gets them.

854
01:39:47,080 --> 01:39:48,411
<i>Frickin'...</i>

855
01:41:44,531 --> 01:41:46,431
<i>I used to get confused.</i>

856
01:41:48,268 --> 01:41:52,864
<i>I used to get confused
where things begin and when they end.</i>

857
01:41:54,107 --> 01:41:56,507
<i>Or what happens before and after.</i>

858
01:41:59,112 --> 01:42:01,012
<i>What about Mom and Dad?</i>

859
01:42:01,648 --> 01:42:03,343
<i>Did they cross the river?</i>

860
01:42:03,416 --> 01:42:05,407
<i>Are they watching us now?</i>

861
01:42:06,252 --> 01:42:07,844
<i>Where will I go?</i>

862
01:42:11,191 --> 01:42:13,921
<i>Sometimes I wonder if I'm superstitious.</i>

863
01:42:14,661 --> 01:42:18,927
<i>Do I believe in broken mirrors,
demons, and curses?</i>

864
01:42:20,100 --> 01:42:23,695
<i>Because sometimes, it's a comfort.</i>

865
01:42:25,972 --> 01:42:27,701
<i>Everything is okay.</i>

866
01:42:30,210 --> 01:42:32,178
<i>You're safe with us now.</i>

867
01:42:41,221 --> 01:42:42,552
<i>Grandpa...</i>

868
01:42:44,090 --> 01:42:45,455
<i>he's awake.</i>

869
01:42:53,199 --> 01:42:55,167
You're safe with us now.

870
01:42:58,037 --> 01:43:01,097
The doctor said
you almost could have drowned.

871
01:43:07,947 --> 01:43:10,677
- How you feel?
- Coins.

872
01:43:13,453 --> 01:43:15,250
- Coins.
- You cold?

873
01:43:18,358 --> 01:43:20,883
Your grandmother is gonna
cook us up some good food...

874
01:43:20,960 --> 01:43:23,394
and I want you to eat real good.

875
01:43:23,596 --> 01:43:25,564
Will you do that for me?

876
01:43:26,032 --> 01:43:27,294
Hell, yeah.

877
01:43:27,901 --> 01:43:32,133
You ever eat any alligator?
It's good. Makes you strong.

878
01:43:32,205 --> 01:43:34,639
They been around 200 million years.

879
01:43:36,576 --> 01:43:39,409
What about venison? Buffalo?

880
01:43:39,913 --> 01:43:42,177
They're all good for you. We'll have all that.

881
01:43:42,248 --> 01:43:43,875
Your grandmother can cook so good...

882
01:43:43,950 --> 01:43:47,113
makes your tongue turn around
and slap your brains.
