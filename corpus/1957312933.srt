All right, I wanna be here too.

00:02:35,995 --> 00:02:38,665
[both moaning]

5
00:02:38,698 --> 00:02:41,334
- You better get up there then.
- Okay, all right, I'm coming.

6
00:02:41,368 --> 00:02:44,405
Oh, watch it! [laughs]

- Get up there.

8
00:02:46,673 --> 00:02:48,008
[woman] Coming.

00:02:55,849 --> 00:02:58,886
Happy anniversary, my love.
[laughs]

10
00:02:58,918 --> 00:03:00,855
- [both moan]
- That was nice.

11
00:03:00,887 --> 00:03:03,056
Yeah, that was really nice.

12
00:03:03,089 --> 00:03:05,325
And there's plenty more
where that's coming from, baby.

13
00:03:05,358 --> 00:03:08,395
- Okay, mm.
- [both laughing]

00:03:08,429 --> 00:03:11,599
- Mm-hmm!
- [both chuckling]

15
00:03:11,631 --> 00:03:16,503
To a beautiful and unforgettable
anniversary, Mrs. Miller.

16
00:03:16,536 --> 00:03:18,538
Mm, I love it
when you call me that.

17
00:03:18,572 --> 00:03:19,940
- [man growls]
- Mm!

18
00:03:19,972 --> 00:03:21,809
[both laughing]

19
00:03:29,016 --> 00:03:32,585
Mm, okay, all right now.

20
00:03:32,619 --> 00:03:35,323
- Mmm.
- All right, come on, baby.

21
00:03:35,356 --> 00:03:38,726
There's plenty of sugar
where that came from.

22
00:03:38,758 --> 00:03:40,428
[laughs] I know it is.

23
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:42,897
Oh, behave.

24
00:03:45,465 --> 00:03:47,701
[both sigh happily]

25
00:03:48,635 --> 00:03:50,404
Here we go, my love.

26
00:03:50,436 --> 00:03:52,639
Mm, thank you.

27
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:57,945
[laughs] Here's to a fresh start

28
00:03:57,977 --> 00:03:59,746
for the three of us.

29
00:04:03,716 --> 00:04:09,556
Mm. I hope Zion
doesn't give Dad a hard time.

30
00:04:09,589 --> 00:04:11,958
You know,
he wasn't feeling this move.

31
00:04:11,992 --> 00:04:13,893
I think he misses
his city friends.

32
00:04:13,927 --> 00:04:16,697
Yeah, but it's better
for Zion, Walt.

33
00:04:16,729 --> 00:04:18,532
It's better for us.

34
00:04:19,832 --> 00:04:21,068
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

35
00:04:22,736 --> 00:04:24,738
- You know...
- Hm?

36
00:04:24,772 --> 00:04:27,642
I was thinking we should open up
a bed and breakfast.

37
00:04:29,409 --> 00:04:31,779
Bed and breakfast.
[laughs]

38
00:04:31,812 --> 00:04:34,582
Come on,
we have the rooms, honey.

39
00:04:34,615 --> 00:04:36,117
[man] You been saying
this all night.

40
00:04:36,149 --> 00:04:38,551
- [woman] Mm, I know.
- [man] You know what my answer is.

41
00:04:38,584 --> 00:04:40,421
[woman] Please.

42
00:04:41,555 --> 00:04:42,724
Anything for you.

00:05:12,452 --> 00:05:15,822
Jed, hello.

47
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:18,959
You there?

48
00:05:18,991 --> 00:05:21,561
Yes, it's your brother.

49
00:05:21,594 --> 00:05:25,965
Listen,
I'm sending my Tommy over,

50
00:05:25,998 --> 00:05:28,802
and you gather your two boys

51
00:05:28,836 --> 00:05:32,740
because I got a job
for them to do.

52
00:05:32,772 --> 00:05:37,411
Do you understand?
Do you understand?!

00:05:40,781 --> 00:05:42,950
[film projector rattling]

54
00:06:20,721 --> 00:06:23,090
[breathing heavily]

55
00:06:24,892 --> 00:06:27,795
I need your strength, Lord,

56
00:06:27,827 --> 00:06:32,599
to say no when I'm tempted
to surrender

57
00:06:32,632 --> 00:06:35,669
to harmful things.

58
00:06:37,671 --> 00:06:43,209
Or when selfishness clings
and won't let go.

59
00:06:43,243 --> 00:06:46,880
I need your strength, Lord,
to say yes.

60
00:06:46,913 --> 00:06:53,687
Yes... when cowardice and fear,

61
00:06:54,687 --> 00:06:56,557
they nudge me.

62
00:06:58,791 --> 00:07:01,628
No, no!

63
00:07:01,661 --> 00:07:03,029
No!

64
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:06,032
[sobbing]

65
00:07:07,334 --> 00:07:12,038
You must do it, you must.

66
00:07:13,673 --> 00:07:14,741
He ordered you to do it.

67
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:18,779
[sobbing]

68
00:07:25,719 --> 00:07:28,088
[man] Hey, Uncle Jed!

69
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:31,024
- Hello, Unc!
- Is that you, Tommy?

70
00:07:31,058 --> 00:07:32,927
Yeah, man,
I heard you yelling outside.

71
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:34,928
Is everything okay,
are you all right?

72
00:07:34,962 --> 00:07:36,930
I been waiting for you!

73
00:07:36,964 --> 00:07:38,632
I know, Pop just sent me over...

74
00:07:38,664 --> 00:07:40,567
Shut up, boy!

75
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,937
Come here.

76
00:07:42,969 --> 00:07:44,804
[whispering indistinct]

77
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,106
All right, you got...

78
00:07:49,108 --> 00:07:51,945
You... all right, all right.
All right.

79
00:07:51,978 --> 00:07:55,214
And your two cousins
are gonna be there with you,

80
00:07:55,248 --> 00:07:56,851
to make sure you do it right.

81
00:07:57,985 --> 00:07:59,252
Get outta here!

82
00:08:01,087 --> 00:08:05,292
No, no, no!

83
00:08:09,695 --> 00:08:10,864
Tommy, come back here.

84
00:08:12,765 --> 00:08:16,803
Now this here
will make too much of a mess.

85
00:08:17,837 --> 00:08:19,339
Now this is iron.

86
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:23,744
It'll knock her out

87
00:08:23,776 --> 00:08:26,913
and finish her too quickly,
no good.

88
00:08:26,947 --> 00:08:31,752
- [hammer thuds]
- This, this is wood.

89
00:08:33,653 --> 00:08:35,788
This'll work just fine.

90
00:08:35,821 --> 00:08:40,893
Now your father, he just had
the rugs cleaned in room nine.

91
00:08:40,926 --> 00:08:43,029
That won't leave much of a mess.

92
00:08:43,696 --> 00:08:45,031
But wait...

93
00:08:47,099 --> 00:08:49,936
You need to finish with this.

94
00:08:52,204 --> 00:08:55,809
All right,
what about the husband?

95
00:08:55,842 --> 00:08:57,712
Tommy, don't worry
about the husband.

96
00:08:58,945 --> 00:09:00,781
The boys will be there
to hold him.

97
00:09:02,114 --> 00:09:03,683
- Oh.
- Wait.

98
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:07,153
I need you to close your eyes.

99
00:09:09,222 --> 00:09:10,992
Keep 'em closed.

100
00:09:19,733 --> 00:09:22,902
Perfect. Now open them.

101
00:09:25,906 --> 00:09:28,976
Your father does not want her
to see your face

102
00:09:29,008 --> 00:09:33,379
when you cleanse her
of her sins.

103
00:09:33,412 --> 00:09:37,984
Go and make her
pure again, Tommy.

104

[woman screaming]

105
00:10:11,017 --> 00:10:13,119
[Tommy]
Now grab him, make him watch!

106
00:10:13,152 --> 00:10:14,988
[woman sobs]
Stop!

107
00:10:15,021 --> 00:10:16,256
- No!
- Louise!

108
00:10:16,289 --> 00:10:18,158
- Settle down, settle down!
- Stop, stop!

109
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:19,493
- Walt, help!
- Get off her!

110
00:10:19,526 --> 00:10:21,161
- Don't fight. [laughing]
- Stop, no!

111
00:10:21,194 --> 00:10:22,896
Walt, help me!

112
00:10:22,929 --> 00:10:25,199
- Let her go!
- [Tommy] Shut him up!

113
00:10:25,232 --> 00:10:26,767
Let her go!

114
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,469
[grunting]

115
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:30,738
Shut up,
or you're both gonna die!

[Louise]
Pocketbook is over there.

117
00:10:32,004 --> 00:10:34,006
Just-just take it,
take what you want.

118
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,809
- Just let us go!
- [Tommy laughs]

119
00:10:35,842 --> 00:10:37,778
You hear that boys,
take what we want?

120
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:39,879
No, I think it's quite
the opposite, ma'am.

121
00:10:39,912 --> 00:10:42,749
My family thinks
you're trying to take from us.

122
00:10:42,782 --> 00:10:45,918
I-I don't understand.
What do you want from us?

123
00:10:45,951 --> 00:10:47,520
It ain't what we want, darlin'.

124
00:10:47,554 --> 00:10:49,156
It's what we gotta do.

125
00:10:49,189 --> 00:10:53,794
You see, I was sent here
to clean you of your sins.

126
00:10:53,826 --> 00:10:55,261
This is all we got.

127
00:10:55,295 --> 00:10:58,232
And you ain't gonna
take it from us!

128
00:10:58,265 --> 00:11:00,134
- No!

Wise...

137

Bring calm in the end.

138
00:12:45,204 --> 00:12:49,943
Lord, forgive me...
[sobbing]

139
00:12:49,975 --> 00:12:52,312

but I know
who you are, Tommy Johnson.

- What's that, Tommy?
- Let me go! [groans]

Who are you,
and how do you know my name?

153
00:15:59,799 --> 00:16:04,204
[man] I'm the one who's going to
dissolve you of your sins.

154
00:16:04,871 --> 00:16:07,240
What...?

155
00:16:07,272 --> 00:16:09,409
What does it mean?

Does that name ring a bell?

I've been following you
for quite some time, Tommy.

161
00:16:27,493 --> 00:16:30,629
I finally found out
what no one else could.

162
00:16:30,662 --> 00:16:33,700

I did...

I didn't do it,
I didn't do it, I didn't do it.

00:18:47,267 --> 00:18:50,603
I had him...
not being my fault.

182
00:18:50,636 --> 00:18:55,241
[sobs] No, no, no, no!

183
00:18:56,409 --> 00:18:58,645
[groaning]

184
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,383
Please, please, no!

185
00:19:04,417 --> 00:19:06,586
[man] As was I, Tommy.

186
00:19:06,619 --> 00:19:08,455
As was I.

187
00:19:08,488 --> 00:19:11,391
[Tommy groaning]

188
00:19:13,058 --> 00:19:15,362
[muffled yelling]

189
00:19:22,969 --> 00:19:25,671
[Tommy gurgling]

190
00:20:23,395 --> 00:20:27,933
John Doe, Caucasian male,
early to mid-70s.

191
00:20:29,469 --> 00:20:32,905
Victim was strangled,
seemed personal.

192
00:20:33,972 --> 00:20:35,974
Dead at least a week or so,

193
00:20:36,007 --> 00:20:39,813
the body left
in almost a staged manner,

194
00:20:39,845 --> 00:20:43,849
as though the killer
wanted our John Doe to be found.

195
00:20:46,451 --> 00:20:50,055
- [man] Detective. Detective.
- Yeah?

196
00:20:50,088 --> 00:20:51,490
You should come down.

197
00:20:51,524 --> 00:20:53,426
The coroner's here
to pick up the body, sir.

198
00:20:53,459 --> 00:20:55,394
- All right, I'll be right there.
- All right.

199
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,402
[detective] And the next day
she says, "Enough."

200
00:21:03,436 --> 00:21:05,472
- I can't figure her out.
- What are you gonna do?

201
00:21:05,505 --> 00:21:08,141
I don't know, we'll see what
happens, all right?

202
00:21:08,173 --> 00:21:10,443
- All right.
- Oh, and by the way,

203
00:21:11,443 --> 00:21:12,878
I want you to do me a favor.

204
00:21:12,911 --> 00:21:14,948
- Hm?
- Take care of the paperwork

205
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:17,383
on this case... [mutters]

206
00:21:17,417 --> 00:21:19,586
- [sighs]
- Don't give me no shush.

207
00:21:19,619 --> 00:21:21,588
- [grunts]
- Come on, I got two cases coming up.

208
00:21:21,621 --> 00:21:22,722
I gotta go out of town.

209
00:21:22,755 --> 00:21:24,023
Take care of this for me,

210
00:21:24,055 --> 00:21:25,959
and I'll take care of you
next week...

211
00:21:25,991 --> 00:21:27,826
- I'm not doing any more paperwork after that.
- No, just...

212
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:29,728
- No papers on another case.
- Of course not.

213
00:21:29,761 --> 00:21:31,998
I'll reward you,
all right, just do this.

214
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:33,665
- All right? Thank you.
- Yeah.

215
00:21:33,699 --> 00:21:35,168
- All right.
- All right, I'll see you tomorrow.

216
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,603
- All right, you got it.
- All right.

217
00:21:38,103 --> 00:21:40,373
- Hey, Guz.
- Yeah?

218
00:21:42,107 --> 00:21:43,876
- Good job today.
- I'll see you later.

219
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:45,178
See you tomorrow, drive safe.

220
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:47,613
[engine starts]

221
00:21:54,953 --> 00:21:57,723
"The property was left to you
by your father."

222
00:22:00,092 --> 00:22:03,764
My father...
What the heck is this?

223
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:08,934
"Go to 1382 River Drive,
bah-bah bah-bah bah-bah bah,

224
00:22:08,968 --> 00:22:12,639
ask for Willy, he'll give you
directions to the old inn."

225
00:22:17,142 --> 00:22:18,944
Thirteen eighty-two.

226
00:22:21,881 --> 00:22:24,584
[chuckles]
A thousand miles away.

227
00:22:25,684 --> 00:22:27,152
[sighs]

228
00:22:27,186 --> 00:22:30,524
Well, road trip it is then.

229
00:23:32,951 --> 00:23:34,921
[man indistinct]

230
00:23:59,344 --> 00:24:02,015
[man] Hey! Hey!

231
00:24:02,047 --> 00:24:03,983
You're in our way, move!

232
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:05,919
Hey!

233
00:24:05,951 --> 00:24:07,886
Yo, what's your problem, dude?

234
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,822
My girl's having a baby,
man, move!

235
00:24:09,854 --> 00:24:12,057
All right...
All right, I'm moving now.

236
00:24:12,091 --> 00:24:13,727
Thanks, mister!

237
00:24:15,827 --> 00:24:18,597
- [engine starts]
- [grinder whirring]

238
00:24:26,671 --> 00:24:28,141
Can I help you, son?

239
00:24:29,808 --> 00:24:31,610
Yeah, I'm looking for Willy.

240
00:24:32,277 --> 00:24:33,746
You found him.

241
00:24:33,778 --> 00:24:37,049
Um, looking for
the old Johnson Inn.

242
00:24:38,084 --> 00:24:39,952
I'm coming around, hold on now.

243
00:24:39,986 --> 00:24:40,987
All right.

244
00:24:42,121 --> 00:24:44,224
[grinder whirring]

245
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:00,739
- Hey.
- You scared me.

246
00:25:07,712 --> 00:25:09,681
Well, good luck to you, son.

247
00:25:09,715 --> 00:25:11,284
And I'm sorry for my grandson,

248
00:25:11,316 --> 00:25:14,886
but his girlfriend's
about ready to burst.

249
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,156
Good luck with that.

250
00:25:28,267 --> 00:25:30,202
[engine stalling]

251
00:25:41,046 --> 00:25:43,048
Goddamnit, come on!

252
00:25:43,082 --> 00:25:44,883
Not now, not now!

253
00:25:44,917 --> 00:25:46,786
- [horn honks]
- Fuck!

254
00:25:48,988 --> 00:25:51,257
- [sighs]
- [horn honks]

255
00:25:56,062 --> 00:25:57,697
What's the matter?

256
00:25:57,729 --> 00:25:59,065
What's the matter?

257
00:25:59,097 --> 00:26:01,166
This damn truck
is what's the matter!

258
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,336
It's all I got, it's everything.

259
00:26:05,403 --> 00:26:07,105
[Willy] I'll take a look at it.

260
00:26:07,139 --> 00:26:09,776
Junior, why don't you
take him down to Miller's B&B?

261
00:26:11,209 --> 00:26:12,711
Bed and breakfast.

262
00:26:12,745 --> 00:26:15,014
Yeah, I know
what it means, thank you.

263
00:26:15,046 --> 00:26:16,449
I thought that's where
the Johnson's live.

264
00:26:16,481 --> 00:26:18,316
Miller's bought it
ten years back.

265
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:20,420
I'll be right back.

266
00:26:20,452 --> 00:26:23,822
[scoffs] Just gonna take off,
huh, walk away?

267
00:26:33,431 --> 00:26:35,701
Soon as we get
an update on your truck,

268
00:26:35,735 --> 00:26:37,303
we'll give you a call
and let you know.

269
00:26:40,773 --> 00:26:42,375
[door beeps]

270
00:26:51,984 --> 00:26:53,420
Hello?

271
00:26:54,987 --> 00:26:56,855
Hello, anyone home?

272
00:26:57,789 --> 00:26:59,358
Gonna rob your house.

273
00:27:40,365 --> 00:27:42,301
What the heck is this place?

274
00:27:46,572 --> 00:27:49,342
Oh, shit, coffin plane.

275
00:28:09,929 --> 00:28:12,498
"Louise Lee, 45 years old,

276
00:28:12,530 --> 00:28:17,002
was remembered by family,
friends as a beautiful soul.

277
00:28:17,036 --> 00:28:19,872
Sources say her and her husband
had a checkered past

278
00:28:19,904 --> 00:28:22,174
but recently moved last year
to pursue a better life

279
00:28:22,208 --> 00:28:24,043
for themselves and their son.

280
00:28:25,344 --> 00:28:28,014
No motive or arrests
have emerged yet."

281
00:28:28,046 --> 00:28:29,181
Wow.

282
00:28:30,882 --> 00:28:33,286
Looks like Louise
must've pissed somebody off.

283
00:28:37,021 --> 00:28:39,057
[faint squeaking]

284
00:28:40,491 --> 00:28:42,127
Anybody there?

285
00:29:05,884 --> 00:29:07,853
[door creaking]

286
00:29:20,431 --> 00:29:22,267
What the heck is this place?

287
00:29:37,348 --> 00:29:39,451
[muttering]

288
00:29:49,428 --> 00:29:51,363
[crickets chirping]

289
00:29:54,266 --> 00:29:55,969
You Jason?

290
00:29:57,670 --> 00:30:01,073
Uh, who's asking?

291
00:30:01,105 --> 00:30:04,209
Willy called, said your car's
gonna be another day or two.

292
00:30:06,277 --> 00:30:10,415
What? What-what happened?

293
00:30:10,449 --> 00:30:13,185
- What happened to the car?
- Ignition plate blew.

294
00:30:13,218 --> 00:30:15,388
But don't worry,
he bought you another one.

295
00:30:17,256 --> 00:30:19,959
Uh, by the way, I'm Nisha.

296
00:30:19,991 --> 00:30:22,127
My family owns the property.

297
00:30:22,161 --> 00:30:24,397
I mean, how-how am I gonna pay for
this, where am I gonna sleep?

298
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:25,931
I was planning on
sleeping in there.

299
00:30:25,965 --> 00:30:27,967
[sighs] I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

300
00:30:27,999 --> 00:30:29,469
You want a drink?

301
00:30:31,970 --> 00:30:33,538
[sighs]

302
00:30:33,572 --> 00:30:34,974
Hell, yeah.

303
00:30:35,007 --> 00:30:36,609
- [both laugh]
- Please, thank you.

304
00:30:36,642 --> 00:30:39,679
Have a seat, got this.

305
00:30:44,482 --> 00:30:46,286
- For you.
- Thanks.

306
00:30:49,488 --> 00:30:52,725
It's just been one of those days
where you just kind of like, uh,

307
00:30:52,757 --> 00:30:55,728
you drive your car
into oncoming traffic.

308
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,028
Except you don't have a car.

309
00:30:57,062 --> 00:30:58,163
- Yeah, exactly.
- [laughs]

310
00:30:58,197 --> 00:31:02,735
Now I have to get rides from
people that smell really bad

311
00:31:02,767 --> 00:31:05,504
or just walk
in this humidity.

312
00:31:05,536 --> 00:31:06,972
- Yeah.
- Oh.

313
00:31:07,006 --> 00:31:08,173
- Anyway, cheers?
- Cheers.

314
00:31:08,207 --> 00:31:09,441
Okay.

315
00:31:09,475 --> 00:31:12,478
- Yes, very bad.
- To everything. Oh...

316
00:31:14,013 --> 00:31:15,214
If you don't mind.

317
00:31:16,148 --> 00:31:17,350
Let me lay back.

318
00:31:18,616 --> 00:31:23,055
So where are you from, Jason...

319
00:31:23,087 --> 00:31:24,556
Jason Brooks.

320
00:31:26,624 --> 00:31:28,526
Guess, where am I from?

321
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:30,061
Where do you think I'm from?

322
00:31:30,094 --> 00:31:31,764
- Wisconsin.
- No, actually,

323
00:31:31,796 --> 00:31:33,332
I'm from, like, all over.

324
00:31:33,364 --> 00:31:34,499
- All over?
- Yeah.

325
00:31:34,533 --> 00:31:39,205
I jumped from foster home
to foster home to foster home...

326
00:31:41,407 --> 00:31:46,012
before this nice couple,
the Brooks, they adopted me.

327
00:31:46,778 --> 00:31:48,680
Then when I turned 18,

328
00:31:48,713 --> 00:31:51,116
that's when I went searching
for my real parents.

329
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:52,517
Mm-hm.

330
00:31:53,719 --> 00:31:55,455
[soft chuckle]

331
00:31:56,521 --> 00:31:58,089
Because that's when I found out

332
00:31:58,123 --> 00:32:01,026
that my mom was killed
in a car accident.

333
00:32:01,059 --> 00:32:03,194
And then, uh,
then my father gave me up.

334
00:32:03,228 --> 00:32:04,430
[chuckles] Sorry.

335
00:32:04,462 --> 00:32:05,998
[coughs]

336
00:32:07,799 --> 00:32:09,301
But, uh...

337
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:16,741
Johnson. Yeah.

338
00:32:16,775 --> 00:32:18,377
- You okay?
- Yeah, no, I'm good, thanks.

339
00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:21,413
Uh... Hey, what... [chuckles]

340
00:32:21,447 --> 00:32:24,650
What is up with that
haunted house back there?

341
00:32:24,682 --> 00:32:27,353
- What's...
- Well, technically, we don't own it.

342
00:32:27,385 --> 00:32:29,320
- Right.
- It's been here

343
00:32:29,353 --> 00:32:31,690
since the last family lived
here, and they owned it.

344
00:32:31,722 --> 00:32:33,191
My uncle tried to remodel it,

345
00:32:33,225 --> 00:32:35,728
but the family
that lived there before

346
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,797
threatened to sue,
so we left it untouched.

347
00:32:45,636 --> 00:32:50,142
Hey, sorry, do you mind if I just
kinda sleep out here for the night?

348
00:32:50,174 --> 00:32:53,611
I already told you you can
sleep in one of the open rooms.

349
00:32:53,644 --> 00:32:55,413
I think room nine
is under construction,

350
00:32:55,447 --> 00:32:56,782
but you can sleep there.

351
00:32:56,815 --> 00:32:57,783
Are you sure it's cool?

352
00:32:57,815 --> 00:32:58,784
- Yeah.
- Are you sure?

353
00:32:58,816 --> 00:33:00,685
- Fine.
- All right, thank you.

354
00:33:00,719 --> 00:33:02,154
Mm-hmm.

355
00:33:07,292 --> 00:33:08,794
Oh.

356
00:33:08,826 --> 00:33:11,630
Okay, see,
that there was a mistake.

357
00:33:11,662 --> 00:33:14,165
- Yeah.
- That was a lot at once.

358
00:33:14,199 --> 00:33:16,134
I mean,
I gave you my good stuff too.

359
00:33:16,168 --> 00:33:17,603
Yeah, sorry.

360
00:33:19,371 --> 00:33:22,141
Well, if you don't mind, just...
If you just...

361
00:33:22,173 --> 00:33:23,776
- Oh, yeah. Mm-hm.
- I appreciate it. Thank you.

362
00:33:23,808 --> 00:33:25,677
[upbeat music playing]

363
00:34:28,806 --> 00:34:30,743
[muted dialogue]

364
00:34:59,738 --> 00:35:02,241
[Jason muttering]

365
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:07,613
[Walt] Let her go!

366
00:35:07,645 --> 00:35:10,216
[Tommy]
Should've kept her quiet, Walt.

367
00:35:10,248 --> 00:35:11,917
We're the only place in town!

368
00:35:13,384 --> 00:35:15,587
You can't take it from us!

369
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:17,455
You... You won't!

370
00:35:32,803 --> 00:35:34,539
[pants]

371
00:35:34,573 --> 00:35:37,210
Help! Help me!

372
00:35:39,544 --> 00:35:41,714
[panting]

373
00:36:05,303 --> 00:36:06,604
[gasps]

374
00:36:06,638 --> 00:36:08,841
[panting]

375
00:36:20,484 --> 00:36:22,354
[birds chirping]

376
00:36:40,439 --> 00:36:42,308
- Nah, that'd be bad.
- [man] Jason!

377
00:36:47,978 --> 00:36:49,781
- Jason.
- Yeah.

378
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,997
- Just leave 'em here?
- [man] Yeah.

379
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:11,769
Got a little, uh, crazy last night.
[laughs]

380
00:37:11,803 --> 00:37:13,939
[man] I see.
[laughs]

381
00:37:13,971 --> 00:37:15,873
You hungry?

382
00:37:15,906 --> 00:37:18,977
- I'm hungover.
- [man] Mm, sit down.

383
00:37:19,009 --> 00:37:21,513
Scramble some eggs,
I'll make you a plate.

384
00:37:21,546 --> 00:37:22,781
Okay.

385
00:37:27,718 --> 00:37:32,724
Oh, uh, Willy called,
said your ignition plate

386
00:37:32,757 --> 00:37:33,859
will be in this evening.

387
00:37:33,892 --> 00:37:35,893
Oh, thank God, thank you.

388
00:37:35,926 --> 00:37:37,829
[sighs]
[clears throat]

389
00:37:39,464 --> 00:37:42,567
Oh, hey, where's Nisha?

390
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,469
You're probably dehydrated.

391
00:37:48,038 --> 00:37:49,507
Drink up.

392
00:37:54,178 --> 00:37:56,147
What's with the spoon?

393
00:37:56,181 --> 00:38:00,119
I put some lemon juice in there.
It'll help with the hangover.

394
00:38:08,692 --> 00:38:11,629
And Nisha went into town
to visit her grandma.

395
00:38:11,663 --> 00:38:12,998
Mm-hm.

396
00:38:13,031 --> 00:38:15,500
Look, I'm gonna run now.

397
00:38:15,533 --> 00:38:16,901
I'll be outta town
for a couple of days.

398
00:38:16,935 --> 00:38:18,603
Nisha'll be back later.

399
00:38:18,636 --> 00:38:22,408
You feel free to hang out
till your truck is ready, okay?

400
00:38:25,576 --> 00:38:27,578
- Uh, excuse me, sir?
- Hm?

401
00:38:27,611 --> 00:38:31,115
Um, look, thank you again
for your hospitality.

402
00:38:31,149 --> 00:38:32,750
I appreciate it.

403
00:38:32,783 --> 00:38:36,654
Uh, doesn't happen
so often around here.

404
00:38:38,223 --> 00:38:39,825
Also, look, uh...

405
00:38:41,926 --> 00:38:43,161
I don't really got much on me,

406
00:38:43,194 --> 00:38:45,397
but I can try
and reimburse you soon.

407
00:38:46,531 --> 00:38:49,768
Soon. And I was thinking,
you know,

408
00:38:49,801 --> 00:38:52,603
maybe I can stick around
a couple of extra days

409
00:38:52,636 --> 00:38:56,975
and help Nisha out, you know,
while you're... while you're gone.

410
00:38:57,007 --> 00:38:59,078
You done enough already.

411
00:39:01,111 --> 00:39:02,914
You cleaned up out back,
remember?

412
00:39:02,948 --> 00:39:04,882
- Oh.
- [both laughing]

413
00:39:04,915 --> 00:39:09,220
- That was... that was, the voice, you scared me.
- [both laughing]

414
00:39:09,254 --> 00:39:11,857
- Luke, I am your father.
- See, that-that...

415
00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:13,859
- That would scare somebody.
- [laughs]

416
00:39:13,892 --> 00:39:15,828
It's fine, eat up.

417
00:39:15,861 --> 00:39:18,564
- All right, thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

418
00:40:04,009 --> 00:40:06,045
[Jason] Help, help!

419
00:40:07,212 --> 00:40:11,116
Help! Somebody help me!

420
00:40:14,685 --> 00:40:16,955
What-what do you want from me?

421
00:40:17,721 --> 00:40:19,190
Who are you?!

422
00:40:19,223 --> 00:40:23,595
[man] The real question is
do you know who you are?

423
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:29,701
You come from a long line
of evil people.

424
00:40:29,734 --> 00:40:32,871
Bad people... [indistinct]

425
00:40:32,904 --> 00:40:35,806
Wait, look-look, I saw...
I saw what happened, all right?

426
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:37,308
I'm sorry for what happened!
I'm sorry, okay?

427
00:40:37,341 --> 00:40:40,645
I'm sorry,
but what do you want from me?

428
00:40:40,678 --> 00:40:42,980
Where... Where are you going?

429
00:40:43,013 --> 00:40:45,316
Where are you going?!

430
00:40:45,350 --> 00:40:47,819
What does this
have to do with me?

431
00:40:47,852 --> 00:40:51,857
Please, let me go!

432
00:40:55,192 --> 00:40:58,296
[muttering]

433
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:00,766
Louise must've
pissed somebody off.

434
00:41:00,799 --> 00:41:03,067
Louise must've
pissed somebody off.

435
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:07,171
You can't take it from us,
you-you won't!

436
00:41:16,714 --> 00:41:20,751
I jumped from foster home
to foster home.

437
00:41:20,785 --> 00:41:22,955
My mom was killed
in a car accident.

438
00:41:22,988 --> 00:41:25,890
Mm-hm. And then, uh,
then my father gave me up.

439
00:41:34,031 --> 00:41:36,267
"The property was
left to you by your father."

440
00:41:36,301 --> 00:41:38,703
"The property was left to you
by your father."

441
00:41:39,803 --> 00:41:41,839
[man] You're a Johnson!

442
00:41:41,872 --> 00:41:42,974
[hammer thuds]

443
00:41:44,341 --> 00:41:45,843
Johnson!

444
00:41:45,877 --> 00:41:47,046
[hammer thuds]

445
00:41:58,422 --> 00:42:01,993
There hasn't been a murder
around here in 40 years.

446
00:42:04,728 --> 00:42:06,330
I should've
known better back then.

447
00:42:06,364 --> 00:42:08,334
[metal clanking]

448
00:42:25,049 --> 00:42:26,685
[officer] Shit, get out.

449
00:42:28,886 --> 00:42:32,991
So who'd you piss off now there,
Mr. John Doe?

450
00:42:34,259 --> 00:42:36,061
Who'd you piss off?

451
00:42:39,230 --> 00:42:41,400
[metal clanging]

452
00:42:45,969 --> 00:42:48,939
Yeah, Johnson,
how you doing, it's Dakota.

453
00:42:48,973 --> 00:42:51,009
Yeah, I'm good, I'm good.

454
00:42:51,942 --> 00:42:54,312
Listen, uh...

455
00:42:54,344 --> 00:42:58,250
you find anything on this-this
old John Doe we found last week?

456
00:43:01,486 --> 00:43:05,323
Right. Hey, man, look,
I know all this already, okay.

457
00:43:05,355 --> 00:43:08,759
But it... I
get it, it's personal.

458
00:43:08,792 --> 00:43:12,463
You know, the body
was left in a staged manner.

459
00:43:12,497 --> 00:43:16,734
All I wanna know is do we have a
positive ID on the guy, that's all.

460
00:43:19,770 --> 00:43:21,272
You got nothing, okay.

461
00:43:21,306 --> 00:43:23,809
Well, why don't you call me
when you do, all right.

462
00:43:23,841 --> 00:43:26,411
All right, anytime
between now and Christmas.

463
00:43:30,748 --> 00:43:31,950
[man] Dakota!

464
00:43:33,884 --> 00:43:36,120
- Earth to Dakota!
- What?

465
00:43:36,154 --> 00:43:38,323
Can't you see
I'm working over here?

466
00:43:38,355 --> 00:43:40,359
You know he's getting out today.

467
00:43:41,493 --> 00:43:42,695
Who?

468
00:43:44,129 --> 00:43:46,297
- [gavel taps]
- [man] Court's in session.

469
00:43:46,330 --> 00:43:50,367
Beau Johnson,
you've served 25 years

470
00:43:50,401 --> 00:43:53,437
of a 25 to 40 year sentence.

471
00:43:53,471 --> 00:43:56,475
The court and the parole board

472
00:43:56,507 --> 00:44:00,444
finds you have met the
requirements for early release.

473
00:44:00,477 --> 00:44:03,981
The court will begin
the necessary paperwork today

474
00:44:04,015 --> 00:44:05,783
for your early release.

475
00:44:05,817 --> 00:44:09,221
We'll inform
your lawyer later today

476
00:44:09,254 --> 00:44:11,223
of the date of your release.

477
00:44:13,558 --> 00:44:15,294
Court is adjourned.

478
00:44:21,399 --> 00:44:24,002
So he finally got paroled, huh?

479
00:44:24,035 --> 00:44:25,536
[laughing]

480
00:44:25,569 --> 00:44:27,439
Told you
you would get you paroled.

481
00:44:27,471 --> 00:44:29,540
Who loves ya, huh?

482
00:44:29,573 --> 00:44:31,809
It's about time, Johnny.

483
00:44:31,843 --> 00:44:33,812
I paid you enough money, man.

484
00:44:33,844 --> 00:44:36,448
You should not be
walking outta this place.

485
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:40,852
Do you realize how many strings
I pulled to get you free?

486
00:44:40,884 --> 00:44:44,890
I'm the one
who did you a favor, asshole.

487
00:44:44,922 --> 00:44:48,359
Just have my money.

488
00:44:49,861 --> 00:44:52,230
You'll be out next week.

489
00:45:20,859 --> 00:45:21,927
[sighs]

490
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:24,096
[man]
Johnson, stop right there.

491
00:45:25,363 --> 00:45:27,399
Get your hands up.

492
00:45:27,431 --> 00:45:29,834
I said
get your hands up, higher!

493
00:45:31,902 --> 00:45:33,437
Don't turn around.

494
00:45:36,875 --> 00:45:39,844
Turn around again, get shot.

495
00:45:41,011 --> 00:45:42,881
[laughs]

496
00:45:42,913 --> 00:45:45,482
Oh, son of a bitch!

497
00:45:45,515 --> 00:45:48,485
[exhales] Oh, I thought
they totally screwed up,

498
00:45:48,518 --> 00:45:50,388
and I was going
right back inside.

499
00:45:50,421 --> 00:45:53,257
Bobby D.
Oh, good to see ya.

500
00:45:53,290 --> 00:45:54,993
Oh, just the guy
I wanted to see.

501
00:45:55,026 --> 00:45:57,328
[energetic rock music]

502
00:46:25,323 --> 00:46:27,292
[Beau] Twenty-five years.

503
00:46:29,326 --> 00:46:31,161
Good to have my freedom back.

504
00:46:31,194 --> 00:46:32,864
Cheers.

505
00:46:34,933 --> 00:46:37,235
[exhales]

506
00:46:37,268 --> 00:46:38,536
So what do you know
about my brother?

507
00:46:38,569 --> 00:46:41,239
I haven't heard from him
in years.

508
00:46:41,272 --> 00:46:43,507
I was hoping you
weren't gonna bring this up,

509
00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:47,278
but last I heard,
he was 302'ed a while back.

510
00:46:47,312 --> 00:46:50,382
- So you...
- I wanted to tell you.

511
00:46:50,415 --> 00:46:52,451
You were facing
the parole board, I...

512
00:46:53,651 --> 00:46:56,254
Yeah, he was never the same

513
00:46:56,286 --> 00:46:58,555
after Pop killed himself.

514
00:46:58,589 --> 00:47:02,393
I don't know why he can't
just leave it in the past.

515
00:47:02,426 --> 00:47:04,695
Dump it there, I did.

516
00:47:04,728 --> 00:47:07,165
- He's not like you, bro. You know that.
- Yeah.

517
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:12,570
Don't, don't.
Don't waste your time with them.

518
00:47:12,602 --> 00:47:14,639
They're with
those jerk-offs out back.

519
00:47:16,473 --> 00:47:19,010
Nah. Watch.

520
00:47:27,085 --> 00:47:29,654
[indistinct chatter]

521
00:47:29,687 --> 00:47:32,089
What the heck do you think
you're doing, asshole?

522
00:47:32,122 --> 00:47:35,059
Shut your mouth, I was gonna
buy you another drink.

523
00:47:35,093 --> 00:47:36,527
Right.

524
00:47:38,261 --> 00:47:40,431
What are you thinkin',
Grizzly Adams?

525
00:47:42,165 --> 00:47:44,969
What about you, girlie,
you want a drink?

526
00:47:46,370 --> 00:47:49,407
Come on.
Something else maybe.

527
00:47:50,774 --> 00:47:53,377
You would love it.

528
00:47:53,410 --> 00:47:56,246
You will be sore, though,
I'll tell you that.

529
00:47:56,279 --> 00:47:58,049
- [scoffs]
- Come on, let me get you a drink.

530
00:48:00,618 --> 00:48:02,253
[Beau] I'm not giving up.

531
00:48:02,285 --> 00:48:04,588
- [man 1] Yo, yo!
- [man 2] Yo, yo!

532
00:48:04,622 --> 00:48:09,094
Yo! Yo, asshole,
got a problem with my girl?

533
00:48:10,428 --> 00:48:11,563
- Nope.
- Yo, asshole!

534
00:48:12,562 --> 00:48:14,999
No problem, no problem.

535
00:48:15,033 --> 00:48:16,601
All right, good.
You got a problem with her,

536
00:48:16,634 --> 00:48:19,070
you got a problem with me, bro.

537
00:48:19,102 --> 00:48:21,071
- Got it?
- No problem.

538
00:48:21,105 --> 00:48:23,007
I was just offering
to buy her a drink, that's all.

539
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:24,743
Why don't you buy your
little bitch boy over there,

540
00:48:24,776 --> 00:48:27,544
Bobby, a drink
and leave me and my girl alone.

541
00:48:27,578 --> 00:48:29,982
I saw you
eyeing her up out back.

542
00:48:31,248 --> 00:48:33,618
- All right.
- That's what I thought.

543
00:48:36,286 --> 00:48:37,288
[grunts]

544
00:48:41,259 --> 00:48:43,395
- [mutters]
- Are you crazy, man?

545
00:48:43,428 --> 00:48:44,629
You just home.

546
00:48:46,464 --> 00:48:48,299
You messed with
the wrong crew, bro.

547
00:48:48,332 --> 00:48:50,368
Get outta here,
get outta here!

548
00:48:50,401 --> 00:48:52,736
You're always
pushing my customers away!

549
00:48:52,770 --> 00:48:55,440
- Me?
- Fine, we're out.

550
00:48:55,473 --> 00:48:58,243
Not you, them.

551
00:48:58,276 --> 00:49:01,178
All right.

552
00:49:01,212 --> 00:49:03,214
You messed with
the wrong crew, bro.

553
00:49:03,247 --> 00:49:05,116
Bobby, keep your boy
in check.

554
00:49:05,149 --> 00:49:06,551
- Get out, asshole.
- [scoffs] Oh, Roy.

555
00:49:06,584 --> 00:49:08,585
[biker] Come on,
bring that shit out, come on.

556
00:49:08,618 --> 00:49:10,521
You're lucky I'm on parole.

557
00:49:10,555 --> 00:49:11,723
- Come on out.
- You're lucky.

558
00:49:11,756 --> 00:49:13,290
- Come on outside, man.
- You're lucky, bro.

559
00:49:13,323 --> 00:49:15,225
- Come on, come on.
- You too, man.

560
00:49:15,259 --> 00:49:16,527
- You're lucky, bro.
- Yeah, right here.

561
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:19,064
- I'll see you later.
- Come on, bro.

562
00:49:19,096 --> 00:49:22,200
- Yeah, you two.
- Yeah, and she's leaving with me, bitch.

563
00:49:22,232 --> 00:49:24,134
- Yeah, come on.
- Yeah, I'll be seeing you at the mill.

564
00:49:24,167 --> 00:49:25,536
[muttering]

565
00:49:25,569 --> 00:49:27,538
[laughing]

566
00:49:27,571 --> 00:49:29,173
- [Beau] Oh!
- [man] Hey!

567
00:49:29,207 --> 00:49:32,676
- Todd!
- Hey, what's going on, big guy?

568
00:49:32,710 --> 00:49:34,412
I haven't seen you
in forever, man.

569
00:49:34,444 --> 00:49:36,280
It's been forever,
good to be out.

570
00:49:36,314 --> 00:49:38,450
- Here's the 20.
- From back then, you remember?

571
00:49:38,482 --> 00:49:41,385
[laughs] Yeah.
Yes, I never forget.

572
00:49:41,419 --> 00:49:43,721
- You're a trip, good man.
- Todd, what's your last name?

573
00:49:43,754 --> 00:49:46,190
- Risto.
- Oh, yeah, right.

574
00:49:46,790 --> 00:49:48,526
[both laughing]

575
00:49:48,558 --> 00:49:51,763
- Good try, good try.
- Good to see ya.

576
00:49:51,796 --> 00:49:55,265
- [coughs] Excuse me. Don't mind him.
- He's a trip.

577
00:49:55,299 --> 00:49:57,402
[bartender]
These are on the house, guys.

578
00:49:58,569 --> 00:50:00,439
- Thanks, bro.
- You got it.

579
00:50:01,172 --> 00:50:02,507
Thank you.

580
00:50:08,446 --> 00:50:10,248
It's good stuff.

581
00:50:13,350 --> 00:50:15,186
Can I buy you another one, stud?

582
00:50:16,786 --> 00:50:18,288
What am I, chopped liver?

583
00:50:18,321 --> 00:50:19,524
[laughs]

584
00:50:20,825 --> 00:50:22,127
Yeah.

585
00:50:26,730 --> 00:50:28,767
One more, bro,
then you gotta go.

586
00:50:29,734 --> 00:50:31,669
Four AM gets here too early,

587
00:50:31,701 --> 00:50:33,604
and I don't... I don't need
another hit and run charge.

588
00:50:33,638 --> 00:50:35,640
I'll give him a ride,
don't worry about it.

589
00:50:38,241 --> 00:50:39,743
[blues music playing]

590
00:50:54,325 --> 00:50:56,160
All right,
I'm gonna take off.

591
00:50:57,562 --> 00:51:01,900
Here's your key,
little extra cash.

592
00:51:01,933 --> 00:51:05,270
All I can say is,
one lucky bastard.

593
00:51:05,303 --> 00:51:06,805
Hey, you take care of him.

594
00:52:04,794 --> 00:52:06,597
[blues music fades

595
00:52:52,643 --> 00:52:55,013
[man] You should've
stayed in jail, Beau.

596
00:52:56,013 --> 00:52:57,781
You would've been safer.

597
00:52:59,517 --> 00:53:01,886
<i>The parole board
may have forgiven you,</i>

598
00:53:02,786 --> 00:53:04,656
<i>but I never will.</i>

599
00:53:15,966 --> 00:53:19,304
[grunting]

600
00:53:20,437 --> 00:53:22,039
I'm gonna get outta here.

601
00:53:22,073 --> 00:53:25,643
- [man laughs]
- And when I do, I'm gonna kill you.

602
00:53:26,777 --> 00:53:28,613
[grunting]

603
00:53:30,714 --> 00:53:33,550
I shoulda kicked your ass
back at that bar.

604
00:53:34,752 --> 00:53:37,355
[man] When I'm through with you,

605
00:53:37,388 --> 00:53:40,292
you're gonna wish I was
that biker at the bar.

606
00:53:41,091 --> 00:53:42,559
Where are you going?

607
00:53:43,493 --> 00:53:45,363
Get back here!

608
00:53:45,395 --> 00:53:48,299
Get back over here, you bitch!
Come here!

609
00:53:56,439 --> 00:53:57,841
[Jed] <i>Say no.</i>

610
00:54:01,879 --> 00:54:03,315
<i>Say no.</i>

611
00:54:07,151 --> 00:54:11,955
Say no
when I'm tempted to surrender

612
00:54:11,989 --> 00:54:15,093
<i>to harmful things.</i>

613
00:54:15,993 --> 00:54:18,796
[rock music playing]

614
00:54:18,828 --> 00:54:21,799
[man] I'm finally done with you,
Beau Bedford.

615
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:26,837
[Beau grunting, wheezing]

616
00:54:44,020 --> 00:54:45,589
You got anything?

617
00:54:45,622 --> 00:54:48,392
This is fresh blood,
he still has his socks on.

618
00:54:48,792 --> 00:54:49,861
Hm.

619
00:54:49,893 --> 00:54:51,763
[phone ringing]

620
00:54:54,531 --> 00:54:58,803
Yeah?
Yeah, it's our boy, Detective.

621
00:55:00,504 --> 00:55:02,140
Me and the kid just got done
securing the area

622
00:55:02,172 --> 00:55:03,473
about a half hour ago.

623
00:55:03,506 --> 00:55:05,609
We're just giving it
last looks now.

624
00:55:06,643 --> 00:55:08,680
Okay, see you soon.

625
00:55:10,547 --> 00:55:11,950
He'll be here shortly.

626
00:55:21,459 --> 00:55:22,727
Hey, Dak.

627
00:55:24,995 --> 00:55:26,964
What's going on?

628
00:55:26,997 --> 00:55:29,466
- How are you?
- Let me tell you something.

629
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:31,803
You guys did
a real good job today.

630
00:55:31,835 --> 00:55:34,038
I'm really proud of you,
you know that?

631
00:55:34,672 --> 00:55:35,907
Thank you.

632
00:55:35,939 --> 00:55:37,741
Here's the next assignment.

633
00:55:37,774 --> 00:55:39,977
The station called, right,

634
00:55:40,009 --> 00:55:43,814
and that... the bartender who
was on duty yesterday with Beau,

635
00:55:43,848 --> 00:55:46,717
he's gonna come down
and answer some questions.

636
00:55:46,750 --> 00:55:48,119
- All right? We need that.
- Okay.

637
00:55:48,152 --> 00:55:49,520
What about the biker?

638
00:55:49,553 --> 00:55:50,821
Do we know where him
and his friends are?

639
00:55:50,855 --> 00:55:54,025
The bikers?
The bikers are in jail.

640
00:55:54,757 --> 00:55:56,960
They screwed up.

641
00:55:56,993 --> 00:55:59,196
Right after they left
Beau and Bobby,

642
00:55:59,230 --> 00:56:00,832
after they had the fight
at the bar,

643
00:56:00,864 --> 00:56:03,600
they went to another bar,
and guess what?

644
00:56:03,634 --> 00:56:07,004
- What?
- Big surprise.

645
00:56:07,036 --> 00:56:10,507
They got into another fight.
[laughs]

646
00:56:10,540 --> 00:56:12,809
What are you gonna do?
All right.

647
00:56:12,843 --> 00:56:16,013
So let's go down to the station,

648
00:56:16,046 --> 00:56:19,616
check out this bartender,
see if he knows anything.

649
00:56:19,649 --> 00:56:21,117
- Understand?
- Sounds like a plan.

650
00:56:21,151 --> 00:56:22,886
Sure does.

651
00:56:22,919 --> 00:56:24,821
[knocking on door]

652
00:56:24,855 --> 00:56:26,591
Yeah, it's open.

653
00:56:26,623 --> 00:56:27,959
[Christian] Hey, boss,
the bartender's here.

654
00:56:27,991 --> 00:56:29,160
You want me to send him in?

655
00:56:29,192 --> 00:56:31,930
Uh, give me two minutes, okay?

656
00:56:41,038 --> 00:56:43,007
[sighs]

657
00:56:45,776 --> 00:56:46,944
[knocking on door]

658
00:56:46,977 --> 00:56:48,179
[Dakota] Yeah, come in.

659
00:56:54,218 --> 00:56:55,585
Thanks, kid.

660
00:56:55,618 --> 00:56:57,721
[bartender sighs]

661
00:56:57,754 --> 00:56:58,955
- What's up?
- We got a hold of Bobby.

662
00:56:58,989 --> 00:57:00,658
- He's gonna come in.
- Right, right.

663
00:57:00,690 --> 00:57:02,192
[Christian] Doesn't seem
too happy, either.

664
00:57:02,225 --> 00:57:04,528
That's understandable, thanks.

665
00:57:07,096 --> 00:57:09,033
Okay, so, uh...

666
00:57:12,201 --> 00:57:13,872
Let's see what we have here.

667
00:57:15,605 --> 00:57:20,111
So I understand that, uh,
you were working on the day

668
00:57:20,143 --> 00:57:22,580
that Beau Johnson
came to your place.

669
00:57:22,613 --> 00:57:23,982
Is that correct?

670
00:57:26,283 --> 00:57:29,821
Excuse me, uh,
I didn't get your full name.

671
00:57:34,892 --> 00:57:36,027
Dre.

672
00:57:37,727 --> 00:57:40,297
Andre Miller, sir.

673
00:57:41,698 --> 00:57:45,168
Okay, well,
I'm Detective Dakota, Andre.

674
00:57:45,201 --> 00:57:46,970
- Yeah.
- That's what you can call me.

675
00:57:47,004 --> 00:57:49,272
Okay. Okay, Detective Dakota.

676
00:57:49,306 --> 00:57:51,309
What am I doing here,
what's this all about?

677
00:57:51,341 --> 00:57:53,544
I got two words for you:

678
00:57:54,611 --> 00:57:55,779
Beau...

679
00:57:57,348 --> 00:57:58,882
Johnson.

680
00:58:04,654 --> 00:58:06,256
And who's that?

681
00:58:06,290 --> 00:58:08,659
- Who's that?
- Yeah.

682
00:58:08,692 --> 00:58:11,029
Beau Johnson was found
murdered this morning.

683
00:58:15,832 --> 00:58:19,803
Well, I didn't do it,
so, what's...?

684
00:58:19,837 --> 00:58:21,772
[soft chuckle]

685
00:58:21,805 --> 00:58:24,875
Well, I think he was
drinking at your bar yesterday.

686
00:58:24,908 --> 00:58:26,310
You were on duty, right?

687
00:58:26,343 --> 00:58:28,913
Yeah, but I get a lot
of customers every shift,

688
00:58:28,946 --> 00:58:30,815
so, what's...?

689
00:58:30,848 --> 00:58:33,250
Well, come on, I mean,
there was a big fight yesterday.

690
00:58:33,283 --> 00:58:34,852
You had to notice the fight.

691
00:58:34,884 --> 00:58:37,821
He was involved,
he knocked out a biker.

692
00:58:37,855 --> 00:58:39,357
Come on, man,
you didn't see this?

693
00:58:39,390 --> 00:58:41,692
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I know who you mean.

694
00:58:41,725 --> 00:58:43,661
I just hadn't heard
that he was murdered.

695
00:58:43,694 --> 00:58:44,829
Right.

696
00:58:44,861 --> 00:58:46,096
So what happened?

697
00:58:47,131 --> 00:58:48,833
Well, if I knew what happened,

698
00:58:48,866 --> 00:58:50,801
then we wouldn't be here
having this meeting.

699
00:58:50,834 --> 00:58:53,404
[scoffs] Look, I'm just
trying to help you out.

700
00:58:53,437 --> 00:58:55,072
Yeah, I get that,
I understand that.

701
00:58:55,105 --> 00:58:56,641
I appreciate that, but you know,

702
00:58:56,674 --> 00:58:59,710
all I wanna do is get to the...
get to the bottom of this.

703
00:58:59,743 --> 00:59:03,848
I mean, I just want to know
was there anything peculiar,

704
00:59:03,881 --> 00:59:06,317
anything particular
that went on with Beau

705
00:59:06,350 --> 00:59:08,185
when he had his friend Bobby
come in with him?

706
00:59:08,218 --> 00:59:10,053
He did come in with him, right,
his friend Bobby?

707
00:59:10,087 --> 00:59:12,790
Yeah. No, I mean,
Bobby D. was there

708
00:59:12,823 --> 00:59:15,192
with this Beau guy
you're talking about.

709
00:59:15,225 --> 00:59:16,993
- Right.
- They threw back some shots,

710
00:59:17,027 --> 00:59:19,196
flirted with some girls
at the bar.

711
00:59:19,228 --> 00:59:21,198
Then the fight broke out,
as you know,

712
00:59:21,230 --> 00:59:22,966
and, uh, that's pretty much it.

713
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,436
You think these bikers might've
had something to do with it?

714
00:59:25,468 --> 00:59:27,103
I mean, they...

715
00:59:27,136 --> 00:59:29,140
Yeah, absolutely.

716
00:59:30,908 --> 00:59:33,310
'Cause I know
after they left your bar,

717
00:59:34,777 --> 00:59:37,848
they went over
to the Old Eagle Inn,

718
00:59:37,881 --> 00:59:40,116
got themselves in a little
trouble over there,

719
00:59:40,149 --> 00:59:42,318
got into another fight,

720
00:59:42,352 --> 00:59:43,888
but the cops were there,
luckily.

721
00:59:43,921 --> 00:59:47,959
Took 'em away, case closed.

722
00:59:50,893 --> 00:59:52,363
But something's bothering me.

723
00:59:52,395 --> 00:59:54,832
Why didn't you call us, I mean,
to fill out a report?

724
00:59:54,864 --> 00:59:57,701
I mean, that would've been the
obvious thing to do, don't you think?

725
00:59:57,734 --> 01:00:00,403
Look, Miss Wendy,
as you know, is the bar owner.

726
01:00:00,437 --> 01:00:04,241
She broke up the fight and she
didn't want to involve you.

727
01:00:04,274 --> 01:00:05,942
She signs my check, so...

728
01:00:06,777 --> 01:00:07,912
[knocking on door]

729
01:00:07,944 --> 01:00:09,180
Yeah?

730
01:00:09,212 --> 01:00:11,716
[Christian]
Detective, Bobby D's here, sir.

731
01:00:11,748 --> 01:00:14,752
- Okay, two minutes.
- All right.

732
01:00:16,419 --> 01:00:19,156
I only have
one more question to ask you.

733
01:00:21,225 --> 01:00:25,096
When Beau left the bar
after the fight,

734
01:00:25,129 --> 01:00:27,131
did you see anything,
anybody go with him?

735
01:00:27,163 --> 01:00:28,432
Was he by himself?

736
01:00:29,799 --> 01:00:31,035
There was a girl.

737
01:00:31,067 --> 01:00:33,169
- A girl?
- Yeah.

738
01:00:33,203 --> 01:00:34,939
What, the biker girl again?

739
01:00:34,971 --> 01:00:37,040
No, no, no, no,
there was another girl,

740
01:00:37,073 --> 01:00:38,441
a real hot filly.

741
01:00:38,475 --> 01:00:41,978
Um, she paid with cash, and, uh,

742
01:00:42,011 --> 01:00:44,948
she bought Bobby
and this other guy a shot.

743
01:00:44,982 --> 01:00:49,253
Then Bobby left, and, uh,
they stayed and continued to party.

744
01:00:49,285 --> 01:00:53,189
So, that's about
all I can remember.

745
01:00:53,223 --> 01:00:56,527
Okay, well, listen, Andre,

746
01:00:56,560 --> 01:01:00,364
I appreciate you
coming down here today.

747
01:01:00,397 --> 01:01:03,901
You were...
you were a lot of help, and, uh...

748
01:01:07,203 --> 01:01:09,939
If I need you, I will call you.

749
01:01:09,973 --> 01:01:12,210
- All right.
- Thank you again.

750
01:01:15,078 --> 01:01:17,248
How'd he get killed,
Detective?

751
01:01:23,486 --> 01:01:25,021
You don't wanna know.

752
01:01:26,056 --> 01:01:27,425
It wasn't pretty.

753
01:01:29,225 --> 01:01:31,928
Poor bastard.

754
01:01:31,962 --> 01:01:34,031
- You take it easy.
- All right.

755
01:01:44,875 --> 01:01:46,110
[Guzman] Sit down.

756
01:01:48,411 --> 01:01:51,482
Well, look who it is,
Bobby D.

757
01:01:51,515 --> 01:01:52,549
Mm-hm.

758
01:01:54,350 --> 01:01:57,988
[Dakota] Just relax, Bobby,
try to get comfortable.

759
01:01:59,890 --> 01:02:01,592
Can I offer you anything?

760
01:02:01,625 --> 01:02:05,329
I tell you what, why don't you
just cut the shit?

761
01:02:05,361 --> 01:02:08,431
My best friend just died
and you call me in here

762
01:02:08,464 --> 01:02:11,100
to offer me coffee?

763
01:02:11,134 --> 01:02:14,205
[scoffs] Ask me the questions,
all right?

764
01:02:16,272 --> 01:02:21,377
Your best friend in prison,
25 years in prison,

765
01:02:21,410 --> 01:02:26,883
gets out and is murdered
on the first night?

766
01:02:26,917 --> 01:02:29,386
That's a little crazy,
don't you think, Bobby?

767
01:02:29,419 --> 01:02:31,455
Something going on here.

768
01:02:31,488 --> 01:02:33,591
I'm the one that should be
doing the talking

769
01:02:33,623 --> 01:02:35,993
and asking the questions here.

770
01:02:37,093 --> 01:02:39,095
You been through this before.

771
01:02:39,129 --> 01:02:42,098
You know the routine,
you know the setup.

772
01:02:42,131 --> 01:02:44,100
Yeah, I have been here before.

773
01:02:44,134 --> 01:02:46,103
Why don't you just
tell me what you wanna hear

774
01:02:46,136 --> 01:02:48,372
or what you wanna know,

775
01:02:48,404 --> 01:02:50,173
and this way,
I can get outta here

776
01:02:50,207 --> 01:02:53,611
and go home and make
the funeral arrangements

777
01:02:53,643 --> 01:02:56,013
for my best friend
that just died.

778
01:02:58,649 --> 01:03:03,286
Listen, he wasn't the best guy,
you know that.

779
01:03:03,319 --> 01:03:08,992
And I'm not either,
so just ask your questions.

780
01:03:09,026 --> 01:03:11,562
Tell me, Bobby,
tell me the truth now.

781
01:03:13,330 --> 01:03:15,299
Anybody on the inside

782
01:03:16,700 --> 01:03:18,368
that might've wanted
to come after Beau

783
01:03:18,402 --> 01:03:19,937
when he got out of prison?

784
01:03:21,305 --> 01:03:23,239
No, not that I know of.

785
01:03:23,272 --> 01:03:25,041
Everybody liked us.

786
01:03:25,075 --> 01:03:27,477
If someone wanted him dead,

787
01:03:27,511 --> 01:03:31,616
he would've been dead on the
inside, but this is different.

788
01:03:34,283 --> 01:03:37,954
How was he killed, Detective?
How?

789
01:03:46,129 --> 01:03:50,401
I'd say it looks pretty personal
to me, don't you think?

790
01:03:52,069 --> 01:03:54,238
Somebody wanted
a vendetta on him.

791
01:03:55,672 --> 01:03:59,009
Enough to...
to poke something

792
01:03:59,042 --> 01:04:02,913
through his neck
in his carotid artery.

793
01:04:04,513 --> 01:04:07,183
Sounds a little
suspicious there, Bobby.

794
01:04:09,285 --> 01:04:10,453
You know, Bobby,

795
01:04:12,388 --> 01:04:15,492
I was reading
all your reports on the inside.

796
01:04:16,493 --> 01:04:18,161
You know what I found out?

797
01:04:19,596 --> 01:04:21,665
You took the fall.

798
01:04:21,698 --> 01:04:24,435
You took the fall for Beau,
didn't you?

799
01:04:26,002 --> 01:04:28,972
Beau broke one of our
correctional officer's arms.

800
01:04:29,006 --> 01:04:33,377
He claimed it was self-defense,
but come on, Bobby.

801
01:04:33,410 --> 01:04:37,181
Both you and I
know that wasn't true.

802
01:04:37,214 --> 01:04:39,049
You and I
know what really happened.

803
01:04:39,082 --> 01:04:40,984
He blamed you, Bobby.

804
01:04:41,018 --> 01:04:43,988
He said it was your idea.

805
01:04:44,020 --> 01:04:48,624
And you did a... extra two years
for that, didn't you, huh?

806
01:04:48,658 --> 01:04:50,761
Yeah, I did.

807
01:04:50,794 --> 01:04:53,430
And actually, what bothers me,
I read in the report

808
01:04:53,462 --> 01:04:56,132
that you said,
"I'm gonna kill Beau."

809
01:04:56,165 --> 01:04:57,734
- Isn't that correct?
- Yeah.

810
01:04:57,768 --> 01:04:59,370
You said you
were gonna kill him!

811
01:04:59,402 --> 01:05:01,305
Isn't that right, Bobby?

812
01:05:01,337 --> 01:05:03,439
Yeah, it is right, okay?

813
01:05:03,473 --> 01:05:06,509
I was angry, man, I was pissed.

814
01:05:06,542 --> 01:05:09,712
I did two extra years for him
'cause I loved him.

815
01:05:09,745 --> 01:05:12,415
If he got written up again,

816
01:05:12,448 --> 01:05:14,717
he woulda definitely
lost his parole.

817
01:05:14,750 --> 01:05:16,786
I was not
letting that happen, man.

818
01:05:16,819 --> 01:05:18,087
[Guzman] Detective, we gotta go.

819
01:05:18,120 --> 01:05:19,422
All right, just calm down,

820
01:05:19,455 --> 01:05:21,591
I'll be right there.
Give me a couple of minutes.

821
01:05:22,325 --> 01:05:23,660
It's Huck, sir.

822
01:05:23,692 --> 01:05:26,162
He's been missing for two days
from the psych ward.

823
01:05:26,196 --> 01:05:29,400
Wait a minute, you mean Huck,
Beau's brother?

824
01:05:29,433 --> 01:05:31,635
Hey... listen, Bobby,
we're done here, okay?

825
01:05:31,667 --> 01:05:33,169
Listen, it was nice seeing ya.

826
01:05:33,203 --> 01:05:35,706
Just grab a coffee and doughnut
on your way out.

827
01:05:35,739 --> 01:05:38,409
Why don't you take the doughnut
and give it to your sister?

828
01:05:38,442 --> 01:05:41,379
[laughs]
Keep an eye on him, will ya.

829
01:05:53,122 --> 01:05:55,158
- [clock bell tolling]
- Hm.

830
01:05:58,395 --> 01:06:00,697
Come on, Zion,

831
01:06:00,730 --> 01:06:04,135
only 14 more hours to go
then you'll be home.

832
01:06:06,236 --> 01:06:08,605
I hate being away
from the kids this long.

833
01:06:13,210 --> 01:06:15,579
I promised you
I'd keep them safe, sis.

834
01:06:17,214 --> 01:06:18,681
They're all I got left.

835
01:06:25,522 --> 01:06:27,357
I'm missing you, too.

836
01:06:46,877 --> 01:06:48,746
[woman groans]

837
01:07:01,625 --> 01:07:03,527
Wait, that way?

838
01:07:08,797 --> 01:07:11,102
[turn signal clicking]

839
01:07:46,602 --> 01:07:48,371
- Hey!
- [man] Hey, how are you?

840
01:07:48,404 --> 01:07:50,173
- Good.
- Welcome to Cream King.

841
01:07:50,207 --> 01:07:51,642
What can I get you, hon?

842
01:07:51,674 --> 01:07:53,910
Uh, what do you recommend,
chocolate or vanilla?

843
01:07:53,944 --> 01:07:55,478
I'd go with the vanilla.

844
01:07:55,511 --> 01:07:56,812
All right,
large vanilla, please.

845
01:07:56,846 --> 01:07:58,782
- [indistinct]
- No, actually, no, plain.

846
01:08:08,725 --> 01:08:10,294
[horn honking]

847
01:08:10,326 --> 01:08:11,594
Little bit extra for you.

848
01:08:11,627 --> 01:08:13,830
- Thank you.
- Here you go.

849
01:08:13,863 --> 01:08:15,399
- There you go.
- Thank you, dear. Thank you.

850
01:08:15,431 --> 01:08:17,768
Thanks.
Have a good day.

851
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:19,803
- Oh, you too.
- Thanks.

852
01:08:36,318 --> 01:08:37,520
Hey, ma'am?

853
01:08:38,721 --> 01:08:40,389
Um, do you happen to know

854
01:08:40,422 --> 01:08:42,826
where the Miller
Bed and Breakfast is?

855
01:08:42,858 --> 01:08:44,727
I'm not even from here,
I'm so sorry.

856
01:08:44,760 --> 01:08:46,295
- Oh, that's okay.
- Good luck!

857
01:08:46,328 --> 01:08:47,797
I'll find it, thanks.

858
01:08:58,774 --> 01:09:02,578
Hey, hey, sir,
are you from here?

859
01:09:02,612 --> 01:09:04,448
Are you...
are you from this area?

860
01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:06,015
Born and raised,
where you headed?

861
01:09:06,049 --> 01:09:08,452
I'm trying to find the
Miller Bed and Breakfast.

862
01:09:08,484 --> 01:09:11,354
- I know it's around here.
- Oh, that's an easy one.

863
01:09:11,388 --> 01:09:15,358
Look, head up three lights,
hang a left on Old England Road.

864
01:09:15,392 --> 01:09:16,859
- Okay.
- It'll be up about a mile.

865
01:09:16,893 --> 01:09:18,862
- Old England Road?
- Old England Road.

866
01:09:18,894 --> 01:09:20,830
- Thank you.
- You're very welcome.

867
01:09:20,863 --> 01:09:23,233
Hope you get where you're going.
Take care.

868
01:09:38,514 --> 01:09:40,383
[engine stalling]

869
01:09:45,587 --> 01:09:46,956
[sighs]

870
01:09:46,989 --> 01:09:50,794
Come on... don't do this!

871
01:09:52,828 --> 01:09:54,797
- [engine starts]
- Oh, thank God.

872

- Oh, hey.

877
01:10:43,645 --> 01:10:45,815
- You need a ride?
- Uh, if you don't mind.

878
01:10:45,849 --> 01:10:47,885
Uh, I'm only
a couple miles up the road.

879
01:10:49,152 --> 01:10:51,020
Yeah, sure, I'll drop you off.

880
01:10:55,657 --> 01:10:58,828
[exhales]
Thanks, appreciate that.

881
01:10:59,996 --> 01:11:02,065
I didn't
catch your name earlier.

882
01:11:02,098 --> 01:11:04,768
I'm Ty, nice to meet you.

883
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:06,336
Nice to meet you.

884
01:11:10,639 --> 01:11:12,375
What... what are you doing?

885
01:11:15,711 --> 01:11:16,846
You need to go.

886
01:11:22,786 --> 01:11:25,756
Star, that's a cute name.

887
01:11:28,892 --> 01:11:31,560
Get out of the car, creep.

888
01:11:31,594 --> 01:11:34,096
[gasps] No! Get off!

889
01:11:34,130 --> 01:11:36,767
Off! Get off me!
[screams]

890
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:39,403
- Hey! Hey! Are you okay?
- No, no!

891
01:11:39,435 --> 01:11:40,937
[Zion] Hey, it's okay,
I just called the cops.

892
01:11:40,970 --> 01:11:44,541
I got this, all right, go ahead.
I got this.

893
01:11:44,573 --> 01:11:47,544
Miss, I heard you screaming,
you all right?

894
01:11:47,577 --> 01:11:48,779
- No!
- She's fine, she's fine.

895
01:11:48,812 --> 01:11:50,013
I asked her.

896
01:11:50,045 --> 01:11:51,647
You know what,
get out the car, man.

897
01:11:51,680 --> 01:11:53,015
Come on, get out the car!

898
01:11:53,049 --> 01:11:54,618
- Look, man, she's-
- Get out here!

899
01:11:54,651 --> 01:11:56,153
Leave her alone!

900
01:11:56,185 --> 01:11:58,854
- [engine stalling]
- Dang car's not starting!

901
01:11:58,888 --> 01:12:00,857
All right, calm down, calm down.

902
01:12:00,889 --> 01:12:03,192
Take your time,
now start the car.

903
01:12:03,225 --> 01:12:06,462
It's okay, he's gone, okay?

904
01:12:08,965 --> 01:12:10,901
- All right, listen, listen, listen...
- [Star sobs]

905
01:12:10,934 --> 01:12:12,769
I called the cops,
they're on their way, all right?

906
01:12:12,801 --> 01:12:13,769
It's gonna take 'em
a little while,

907
01:12:13,803 --> 01:12:14,970
but I'm right down the road.

908
01:12:15,004 --> 01:12:17,107
My car's right over there, okay?

909
01:12:17,139 --> 01:12:22,011
I'm Mr. Miller.
I'm a good guy, Scout's honor.

910
01:12:22,045 --> 01:12:26,550
We can just wait for them
down there, okay?

911
01:12:26,582 --> 01:12:31,455
Get the car towed and get
the car looked at, all right?

912
01:12:31,487 --> 01:12:32,822
Just... I know you
been through a lot.

913
01:12:32,855 --> 01:12:34,090
It's terrible
what he tried to do to you.

914
01:12:34,122 --> 01:12:35,724
Just-just calm down,
I know you're upset.

915
01:12:35,757 --> 01:12:37,727
- Okay?
- Okay.

916
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:39,629
Take your time.

917
01:12:39,662 --> 01:12:41,131
Watch out for traffic.

918
01:12:45,734 --> 01:12:48,737
Right down the road here, okay?

919
01:12:48,770 --> 01:12:51,575
Watch out. It's okay.
It's over here.

920
01:12:51,608 --> 01:12:54,945
Take your time.
You look rattled.

921
01:12:54,978 --> 01:12:57,047
Where'd that guy
come from anyway?

922
01:12:57,080 --> 01:12:58,982
I was just giving him a ride.

923
01:12:59,014 --> 01:13:01,684
What? You...
A young lady by yourself

924
01:13:01,718 --> 01:13:03,953
can't be picking up hitchhikers.

925
01:13:05,889 --> 01:13:07,724
Here we are.

926
01:13:07,756 --> 01:13:09,259
The cops are on their way.

927
01:13:09,291 --> 01:13:12,127
I gave them my address,
so don't worry.

928
01:13:12,161 --> 01:13:14,498
You wanna come back in the kitchen
and get something to drink?

929
01:13:15,297 --> 01:13:17,000
- Yeah.
- Follow me.

930
01:13:17,901 --> 01:13:19,001
Right through here.

931
01:13:20,903 --> 01:13:22,938
Who was that creep?

932
01:13:22,971 --> 01:13:28,111
He said that his name was Ty or
something when he attacked me.

933
01:13:28,144 --> 01:13:31,048
I don't know,
but you're safe now.

934
01:13:37,653 --> 01:13:39,188
Thanks for helping me out.

935
01:13:42,090 --> 01:13:43,759

937
01:13:47,830 --> 01:13:49,166
Nice to meet you, Star.

938
01:13:53,236 --> 01:13:54,770
What's wrong?

939
01:13:54,804 --> 01:13:57,574
[groans] I-I left
the letter in the car.

940
01:13:57,607 --> 01:13:59,843
It has the address
that I was going to.

941
01:13:59,876 --> 01:14:02,679
It's the Bedford place,
do you know it?

942
01:14:02,711 --> 01:14:04,080
Yeah, I've heard of it,

943
01:14:04,112 --> 01:14:06,148
but they sold that
a few years back.

944
01:14:06,181 --> 01:14:08,251
It's about a mile
or so down the road.

945
01:14:10,153 --> 01:14:12,689
Maybe the cops'll take me.

946
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:19,296
You have a bathroom?

947
01:14:19,328 --> 01:14:21,031
Sure, right through there
to the left.

948
01:14:23,099 --> 01:14:24,801

- You okay?
- Don't feel so good.

952
01:14:39,616 --> 01:14:41,984
- Just need to sit down.
- Yeah, yeah. Sit down.

953
01:14:42,852 --> 01:14:44,086
Relax.

954
01:14:46,322 --> 01:14:49,926
Just gonna rest my eyes
for a sec.

Yeah, you had a rough day.

- What a nice place you have.
- Mm-hm.

It's good to be back.

Please, don't do that.

and not pay for it?

983
01:18:19,935 --> 01:18:21,871

I was in the hospital

01:24:41,382 --> 01:24:43,818
Tough old bird.

1048
01:24:43,852 --> 01:24:47,223
Since when do you
check up on me like that?

1049
01:24:47,255 --> 01:24:49,524
He's gonna be fine,
just had a nasty cut.

1050
01:24:49,558 --> 01:24:52,761
They're gonna fix him up.
He'll be out of here in no time.

1051
01:24:52,795 --> 01:24:55,464
Looks like more than
a nasty cut to me.

1052
01:24:55,496 --> 01:24:57,632
I mean, I just talked to
one of the nurses.

1053
01:24:57,666 --> 01:24:59,535
She said they're getting
another room for you.

1054
01:24:59,568 --> 01:25:02,205
You're gonna be
admitted here very shortly.

1055
01:25:02,237 --> 01:25:06,274
Yeah, like my niece said,
I'll be fine.

1056
01:25:06,308 --> 01:25:08,344
Listen,
I'm gonna get going, okay?

1057
01:25:08,376 --> 01:25:11,279
Dre'll be here soon
to come pick you up.

1058
01:25:11,313 --> 01:25:13,248
Um, you gonna be all right?

1059
01:25:13,282 --> 01:25:14,684
Yeah, I'll be all right,
baby girl.

1060
01:25:14,716 --> 01:25:16,484
- Okay.
- Take care.

1061
01:25:16,518 --> 01:25:17,953
- Detective.
- Nice meeting you.

1062
01:25:19,354 --> 01:25:21,323
Thanks for coming by.

1063
01:25:21,357 --> 01:25:22,825
You take care, Nisha.

1064
01:25:27,595 --> 01:25:29,565
So let me ask you something.

1065
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,703
What were you
doing out late last night

1066
01:25:33,736 --> 01:25:35,537
running around the woods?

1067
01:25:36,604 --> 01:25:37,872
Just doesn't make sense.

1068
01:25:37,906 --> 01:25:40,843
[laughs] Damn deer.

1069
01:25:41,644 --> 01:25:43,613
Uh... deer?

1070
01:25:43,645 --> 01:25:45,014
Yeah.

1071
01:25:45,046 --> 01:25:47,782
They're getting bad around here.

1072
01:25:47,815 --> 01:25:49,785
I've been setting traps
and putting up fences

1073
01:25:49,818 --> 01:25:52,521
to keep them
from entering my property.

1074
01:25:52,554 --> 01:25:54,023
It's getting cold, Detective.

1075
01:25:54,055 --> 01:25:55,957
I'm running out of time
to harvest my veggies.

1076
01:25:55,991 --> 01:25:57,859
[chuckles]

1077
01:25:57,893 --> 01:26:01,596
Anyway, I was checking on
my traps and my fences,

1078
01:26:01,630 --> 01:26:04,433
and as luck would have it,
I misstepped

1079
01:26:04,465 --> 01:26:06,368
and I tripped
one of my devices.

1080
01:26:06,402 --> 01:26:08,605
[laughs]
One of my own devices.

1081
01:26:10,471 --> 01:26:13,509
I guess karma's
a real bitch, huh?

1082
01:26:13,541 --> 01:26:15,844
It always catches you
in the end.

1083
01:26:17,779 --> 01:26:18,880
Yeah.

1084
01:26:20,715 --> 01:26:22,451
Yeah, karma's a bitch.

1085
01:26:24,385 --> 01:26:27,822
So listen, you take care
of that, uh, that leg, okay?

1086
01:26:27,855 --> 01:26:31,059
I'll be seeing you around.

1087
01:26:31,093 --> 01:26:32,795
- Hey, Dakota.
- What?

1088
01:26:33,696 --> 01:26:36,332
It's kinda crazy, huh?

1089
01:26:36,364 --> 01:26:41,837
There hasn't been a murder
around here in what, 40 years?

1090
01:26:43,505 --> 01:26:47,644
We did our best, just know that.

1091
01:26:49,478 --> 01:26:53,448
All these years later, what,
like four or five murders

1092
01:26:53,482 --> 01:26:55,852
all of a sudden just happen?

1093
01:26:57,019 --> 01:26:58,521
I don't know about you,
Detective,

1094
01:26:58,554 --> 01:27:02,958
but to me,
somebody pissed someone off.

1095
01:27:02,991 --> 01:27:06,696
Or maybe bad luck
just caught up with some people.

1096
01:27:09,997 --> 01:27:11,567
Yeah.

1097
01:27:11,599 --> 01:27:14,069
Hey, Mr. Miller,
how you feeling?

1098
01:27:14,103 --> 01:27:17,473
- Ah, a little sore.
- Well, I have some meds...

1099
01:27:17,505 --> 01:27:19,642
- Thanks.
- For your pain.

1100
01:27:19,675 --> 01:27:21,377
They'll take care of that.

1101
01:27:21,410 --> 01:27:23,578
- Okay.
- And while I'm here,

1102
01:27:23,612 --> 01:27:26,748
I'm going to check your wound
before we move you.

1103
01:27:26,782 --> 01:27:28,884
I'll let you
do what you gotta do.

1104
01:27:28,916 --> 01:27:31,120
You have any idea what room
they're moving me to,

1105
01:27:31,153 --> 01:27:35,591
so I can let my niece and nephew
know where I'm gonna be at?

1106
01:27:37,393 --> 01:27:40,630
Yeah, that, uh, that's...
will be room nine.

1107
01:27:47,068 --> 01:27:49,471
[laughing]

1108
01:27:52,808 --> 01:27:54,410
Karma, Mama.

1109
01:27:55,510 --> 01:27:56,545
[laughs]

1110
01:27:57,845 --> 01:28:01,017
- Say again?
- Uh... Just, nothing.

1111
01:28:03,050 --> 01:28:04,920
These meds got me loopy.

1112
01:28:06,955 --> 01:28:08,424
Thanks.

1113
01:28:11,760 --> 01:28:13,963
[laughing]

1114
01:28:16,898 --> 01:28:18,700
[shouting]

1115
01:28:18,733 --> 01:28:21,770
- [Star grunting
- [Zion groaning]

1116
01:28:34,983 --> 01:28:38,087
My grandfather didn't wanna be
a part of what happened.

1117
01:28:40,121 --> 01:28:43,459
I'm sorry for what happened
to your mother,

1118
01:28:43,492 --> 01:28:45,395
but he didn't wanna do it.

1119
01:28:46,828 --> 01:28:48,430
[grunts] Fuck!

1120
01:28:48,464 --> 01:28:49,765
How do you know
what happened to my mother?

1121
01:28:49,797 --> 01:28:53,536
My grandfather wrote a journal
before he died.

1122
01:28:59,140 --> 01:29:03,578
He wrote everything that happened
before he killed himself.

1123
01:29:14,956 --> 01:29:17,192
[panting]

1124
01:29:17,225 --> 01:29:18,960
I've had that since I was a kid.

1125
01:29:19,995 --> 01:29:22,532
[groans] Fuck.

1126
01:29:23,599 --> 01:29:26,902
I got a letter...
[panting]

1127
01:29:26,934 --> 01:29:31,005
and it told me that I
inherited part of his land

1128
01:29:31,038 --> 01:29:33,142
and that I needed
to come in town.

1129
01:29:36,644 --> 01:29:40,715
I've been looking for you
this whole time.

1130
01:29:43,551 --> 01:29:47,122
My grandfather wrote about you.

1131
01:29:48,657 --> 01:29:50,193
He wrote about you.

1132
01:29:53,929 --> 01:29:55,931
I had no idea it was you.

1133
01:30:01,036 --> 01:30:03,206
I can't let you go, Star.

1134
01:30:05,640 --> 01:30:08,611
You come from a long line
of bad people.

1135
01:30:08,644 --> 01:30:11,581
I have to cleanse
your bloodline...

1136
01:30:12,648 --> 01:30:14,617
so it can be cured of evil.

1137
01:30:16,318 --> 01:30:18,754
I have to finish what I started.

1138
01:30:18,787 --> 01:30:20,523
[Star shouts]

1139
01:30:23,692 --> 01:30:26,828
[Zion] <i>My father never
talked about what happened</i>

1140
01:30:26,862 --> 01:30:30,666
<i>on that fateful night
in room nine.</i>

1141
01:30:30,698 --> 01:30:35,071
<i>But 40 years later,
someone finally did.</i>

1142
01:30:36,904 --> 01:30:40,009
<i>When the Johnson/Bedford place
went up for sale,</i>

1143
01:30:40,041 --> 01:30:43,144
<i>I bought it in my mom's honor.</i>

1144
01:30:43,178 --> 01:30:46,114
<i>Even though
she lost her life there,</i>

1145
01:30:46,148 --> 01:30:50,986
<i>she always wanted to own one,
so now she does.</i>

1146
01:30:51,019 --> 01:30:55,757
You know, I was thinking we should
open up a bed and breakfast.

1147
01:30:59,126 --> 01:31:03,131
[Zion] <i>Then one day
I was digging in the garden</i>

1148
01:31:04,099 --> 01:31:05,935
<i>and found that hood.</i>

1149
01:31:13,908 --> 01:31:15,310
<i>The bogeyman.</i>

1150
01:31:18,846 --> 01:31:24,018
<i>And the next day, an old man stopped
by to welcome me to the neighborhood</i>

1151
01:31:24,051 --> 01:31:26,788
<i>and mentioned he had to get
something off his chest,</i>

1152
01:31:26,822 --> 01:31:31,627
<i>a secret he's been hiding
for 40 years.</i>

1153
01:31:33,060 --> 01:31:35,931
<i>Forty damn years!</i>

1154
01:31:37,366 --> 01:31:40,636
<i>That's a long time
to keep a secret.</i>

1155
01:31:43,170 --> 01:31:46,274
<i>My mother was killed
'cause crazy Charlie Johnson</i>

1156
01:31:46,308 --> 01:31:50,312
<i>overheard her saying she wanted
her own bed and breakfast.</i>

1157
01:31:50,345 --> 01:31:54,650
[Louise] I was thinking we should
open up a bed and breakfast.

1158
01:31:54,683 --> 01:31:58,252
[Zion] <i>Charlie thought that
would take away his customers</i>

1159
01:31:58,286 --> 01:32:00,922
<i>and he would lose business,</i>

1160
01:32:00,956 --> 01:32:03,859
<i>so that's when he called
his brother Jed</i>

1161
01:32:03,892 --> 01:32:06,162
<i>and ordered her murder.</i>

1162
01:32:08,929 --> 01:32:13,234
<i>After old man Willy broke down
and told me his secret,</i>

1163
01:32:13,268 --> 01:32:16,872
<i>that he knew what happened
that night to my mom,</i>

1164
01:32:16,904 --> 01:32:21,643
<i>that she was killed over greed,
over damn greed!</i>

1165
01:32:23,178 --> 01:32:25,848
<i>But he couldn't say anything.</i>

1166
01:32:25,880 --> 01:32:29,351
<i>He was just too scared
to say anything.</i>

1167
01:32:30,751 --> 01:32:33,955
<i>Well, that's when he helped me</i>

1168
01:32:33,988 --> 01:32:36,090
<i>put my plan into motion.</i>

1169
01:32:36,123 --> 01:32:37,893
[saw whirring]

1170
01:32:37,925 --> 01:32:41,663
<i>I wanted them to suffer,</i>

1171
01:32:41,697 --> 01:32:45,034
<i>just like they made
my father suffer.</i>

1172
01:32:45,067 --> 01:32:49,005
<i>They killed his wife
right in front of him.</i>

1173
01:32:50,337 --> 01:32:53,975
<i>So I made the murder bench.</i>

1174
01:32:54,009 --> 01:32:58,346
<i>I would make them suffer
just like Mom did.</i>

1175
01:33:01,817 --> 01:33:05,354
<i>That's when I became him.</i>

1176
01:33:07,288 --> 01:33:09,791
<i>They created him.</i>

1177
01:33:12,993 --> 01:33:15,230
<i>Tommy was the first to go.</i>

1178
01:33:16,297 --> 01:33:20,335
[laughing]

1179
01:33:20,367 --> 01:33:23,138
<i>I had fun with him.</i>

1180
01:33:24,105 --> 01:33:26,442
<i>Then came Beau.</i>

1181
01:33:26,474 --> 01:33:30,278
<i>I had fun plunging that stake
through his throat.</i>

1182
01:33:32,214 --> 01:33:34,716
<i>Then came Huck.</i>

1183
01:33:34,750 --> 01:33:37,086
<i>I saved him for last.</i>

1184
01:33:38,385 --> 01:33:40,354
<i>See, good old Huck,</i>

1185
01:33:40,388 --> 01:33:42,757
<i>well, he killed two people,</i>

1186
01:33:42,791 --> 01:33:46,295
<i>my mother and my sister.</i>

1187
01:33:46,327 --> 01:33:50,398
<i>Sis died a couple of years back
by a drunk driver.</i>

1188
01:33:50,431 --> 01:33:53,868
<i>That's when I took custody
of my niece and nephew.</i>

1189
01:33:55,103 --> 01:33:57,105
<i>Huck pleaded innocent,</i>

1190
01:33:57,139 --> 01:33:58,940
<i>that it was insanity</i>

1191
01:33:58,974 --> 01:34:03,879
<i>and the booze
that killed my sister, not him!</i>

1192
01:34:03,912 --> 01:34:06,749
<i>But it was the guilt
of my mother's death</i>

1193
01:34:06,782 --> 01:34:09,251
<i>that turned him
into an alcoholic.</i>

1194
01:34:11,553 --> 01:34:15,323
<i>Now let's not forget
you and Jason.</i>

1195
01:34:15,357 --> 01:34:20,962
<i>I sent you two the letters
to lure you both here.</i>

1196
01:34:20,996 --> 01:34:23,465
<i>You see, Jason is a Johnson,</i>

1197
01:34:23,497 --> 01:34:26,201
<i>and you're a Bedford, Star.</i>

1198
01:34:28,135 --> 01:34:30,404
You're a Johnson!

1199
01:34:30,438 --> 01:34:34,408
<i>You see, evil is in your blood</i>

1200
01:34:34,442 --> 01:34:37,412
<i>and there's no help
for you, Star.</i>

1201
01:34:39,346 --> 01:34:42,917
[groaning]
I can help you, though.

1202
01:34:44,286 --> 01:34:46,322
[laughing]

1203
01:34:47,087 --> 01:34:48,323
Help me?

1204
01:34:51,091 --> 01:34:54,362
You're the last of
the Bedford/Johnson bloodline.

1205
01:34:55,863 --> 01:34:59,834
After I'm finished with you,
I'm done.

1206
01:35:01,469 --> 01:35:04,006
I have to finish
what I started.

1207
01:35:05,573 --> 01:35:08,076
[grunts] I can help you finish.

1208
01:35:09,944 --> 01:35:11,447
There's more of them.

1209
01:35:13,447 --> 01:35:14,950
What?

1210
01:35:14,983 --> 01:35:17,953
My Uncle Beau had three boys

1211
01:35:17,986 --> 01:35:19,321
before he went to jail.

1212
01:35:20,522 --> 01:35:23,192
They're bad.

1213
01:35:23,224 --> 01:35:25,560
They're bad
like the rest of them.

1214
01:35:27,295 --> 01:35:29,832
They hurt people.

1215
