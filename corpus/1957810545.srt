1
00:00:43,574 --> 00:00:47,536
Looking back on the horrific events

2
00:00:47,538 --> 00:00:49,893
that happened on your family farm,

3
00:00:51,672 --> 00:00:54,908
do you ever worry that
they never found the body?

4
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:00,173
It's a fear I live with every day.

5
00:01:02,135 --> 00:01:03,251
Hmm.

6
00:01:03,253 --> 00:01:06,406
Speaking of fear, do you also fear

7
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:08,669
that he may come after you?

8
00:01:10,274 --> 00:01:14,417
You know, for some type
of revenge or retaliation?

9
00:01:16,955 --> 00:01:18,732
I personally don't.

10
00:01:21,321 --> 00:01:23,502
Total random act of violence.

11
00:01:23,504 --> 00:01:25,305
- Mm-hmm.
- Could have been anyone.

12
00:01:26,947 --> 00:01:29,518
Just so, it happened to be us.

13
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,721
Wrong place, wrong time,

14
00:01:32,553 --> 00:01:33,553
but totally random.

15
00:01:35,399 --> 00:01:39,067
You know, there is a big hysteria

16
00:01:39,069 --> 00:01:41,842
about what happened to you guys

17
00:01:43,468 --> 00:01:45,784
And Adam, it's, it's
interesting that you talk

18
00:01:45,786 --> 00:01:48,471
about random acts of violence.

19
00:01:49,369 --> 00:01:52,160
It wasn't long ago, I
was reading some material

20
00:01:52,162 --> 00:01:53,541
that talked about out,

21
00:01:54,845 --> 00:01:59,172
sometimes violence incites more violence.

22
00:02:01,111 --> 00:02:05,213
Do you think that the
actions of Colin Miller

23
00:02:05,215 --> 00:02:10,220
would inspire more acts
of random violence?

24
00:02:11,011 --> 00:02:13,063
I would hope that wouldn't be the case,

25
00:02:14,675 --> 00:02:16,600
but in today's society,

26
00:02:17,558 --> 00:02:19,688
people do tend to feed
off negative energy.

27
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:21,700
- Mm.
- So while I hope

28
00:02:21,702 --> 00:02:25,383
that doesn't happen, I
could see where others

29
00:02:25,385 --> 00:02:28,188
could tap into the darkness
that possessed Colin Miller.

30
00:02:31,248 --> 00:02:33,654
It's a scary world we live in.

31
00:02:46,426 --> 00:02:49,277
This is it. Don't be chickenshit.

32
00:02:49,279 --> 00:02:50,979
Come on. We've talked
about this for days.

33
00:02:50,981 --> 00:02:54,192
Myles, you're scared of
your own fucking shadow.

34
00:02:54,194 --> 00:02:55,599
I am not, Maddy.

35
00:02:56,767 --> 00:02:58,587
No going back now.

36
00:02:58,589 --> 00:02:59,653
No going back.

37
00:03:01,702 --> 00:03:03,654
I wonder if there'll be a lot of blood.

38
00:03:05,255 --> 00:03:07,958
Hopefully.

39
00:03:13,018 --> 00:03:15,023
Is it necessary to
always make that noise

40
00:03:15,025 --> 00:03:16,555
every time you brush your teeth?

41
00:03:16,557 --> 00:03:18,797
What's up with the kids?

42
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:19,928
What do you mean?

43
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:22,818
Eh, there's something off.

44
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:25,544
Look who their father is.

45
00:03:25,546 --> 00:03:27,447
There's always gonna be something off.

46
00:03:28,478 --> 00:03:31,710
They barely said a word all evening.

47
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,805
Yeah, they're probably
just tired from playing.

48
00:04:04,447 --> 00:04:06,513
Maddy.

49
00:04:06,515 --> 00:04:09,350
Shit! I almost my pissed my pants.

50
00:04:10,851 --> 00:04:12,357
Why aren't you in bed?

51
00:04:15,896 --> 00:04:16,896
Maddy?

52
00:04:19,893 --> 00:04:21,174
Are you okay?

53
00:04:22,863 --> 00:04:23,863
Never better.

54
00:04:34,465 --> 00:04:37,406
That's it.

55
00:04:37,408 --> 00:04:38,492
Myles! Maddy!

56
00:04:50,821 --> 00:04:51,821
Honey?

57
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:28,880
Oh my God!

58
00:05:29,603 --> 00:05:34,608
J.P? Oh, oh my God!

59
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:43,039
911. What's your emergency?

60
00:05:46,192 --> 00:05:48,360
Somebody's killed him!

61
00:05:48,362 --> 00:05:49,377
Please!
- Ma'am, I need you

62
00:05:49,379 --> 00:05:50,676
to stay on the line.
- Please help me!

63
00:05:50,678 --> 00:05:51,958
Attention all units we have a...

64
00:05:52,611 --> 00:05:54,349
1034 in progress.

65
00:05:54,351 --> 00:05:56,241
Ma'am, ma'am,

66
00:05:56,243 --> 00:05:57,740
are you all right?

67
00:05:57,742 --> 00:05:59,337
I need to know where you are.

68
00:05:59,339 --> 00:06:01,622
- Maddy!
- What should we do with her?

69
00:06:01,624 --> 00:06:03,154
- No!
- Hello?

70
00:06:03,156 --> 00:06:04,673
Make her squeal like a bitch.

71
00:06:13,844 --> 00:06:15,216
Rita Wanayo with Channel 26,

72
00:06:15,218 --> 00:06:17,826
and we are standing in front of the home

73
00:06:17,828 --> 00:06:22,420
on Poplar Bluff Road in the
small town of Carpenter Falls,

74
00:06:22,422 --> 00:06:24,973
where police have just taken into custody

75
00:06:24,975 --> 00:06:28,547
two young children who
have allegedly committed

76
00:06:28,549 --> 00:06:31,620
a series of ritualistic murders.

77
00:06:31,622 --> 00:06:34,102
Sadly, this is not the first time

78
00:06:34,104 --> 00:06:37,185
this town has seen tragedy.

79
00:06:37,187 --> 00:06:39,728
I am being informed by authorities

80
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:42,040
that these crimes may have been influenced

81
00:06:42,042 --> 00:06:45,634
by those of Colin Miller,
a notorious serial killer

82
00:06:45,636 --> 00:06:48,581
known to many as The Wicked One.

83
00:11:12,034 --> 00:11:13,732
Minnesota.

84
00:11:13,734 --> 00:11:16,449
Dad, we stopped playing miles ago.

85
00:11:17,504 --> 00:11:18,672
Well it still counts.

86
00:11:18,674 --> 00:11:23,128
Just cuz you guys are so
losers doesn't mean anything.

87
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:26,599
This drive is taking forever.

88
00:11:26,601 --> 00:11:27,796
If the Nova was a busted,

89
00:11:27,798 --> 00:11:30,273
I could have been there hours ago.

90
00:11:30,275 --> 00:11:32,410
Is that complaining I hear back there?

91
00:11:32,412 --> 00:11:34,690
Yeah, I do believe it is.

92
00:11:34,692 --> 00:11:36,374
And how many times
did your father tell you

93
00:11:36,376 --> 00:11:38,371
to stay up-to-date on your oil changes?

94
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:41,252
It's so lame that at 17 years old,

95
00:11:41,254 --> 00:11:44,087
I have to get a ride
with my parents to a gig.

96
00:11:45,526 --> 00:11:49,180
But honey, we love
taking you to your gigs.

97
00:11:49,182 --> 00:11:52,147
- It's embarrassing.
- Not for us.

98
00:11:52,149 --> 00:11:54,122
I'm gonna tear Valentine's
head off when I see

99
00:11:54,124 --> 00:11:56,545
his Joey Ramone wanna-be ass.

100
00:11:56,547 --> 00:11:58,256
Daniel, there is no way that Valentine

101
00:11:58,258 --> 00:12:00,458
would've known that your
car was gonna kerplunk

102
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:01,990
because of your negligence.

103
00:12:01,992 --> 00:12:03,682
Do you think GG All in ever had to drive

104
00:12:03,684 --> 00:12:05,824
to CBGB's with his parents?

105
00:12:05,826 --> 00:12:08,737
Well, considering his
father was a religious freak

106
00:12:08,739 --> 00:12:11,489
who named his son Jesus Christ,

107
00:12:11,491 --> 00:12:13,812
uh, you know, beat him,

108
00:12:13,814 --> 00:12:16,124
threatened murder and bury him in cellar,

109
00:12:16,126 --> 00:12:19,207
I'm gonna have to take
a wild guess and say no.

110
00:12:19,209 --> 00:12:21,689
Impressive knowledge of
punk rock there, good sir.

111
00:12:21,691 --> 00:12:24,594
I'm not as old
as lame as Daniel thinks I am.

112
00:12:25,687 --> 00:12:28,014
Mm, nah, you're still pretty lame.

113
00:12:28,016 --> 00:12:30,118
Hey, don't forget who taught you

114
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,820
the chords to "Holiday in Cambodia."

115
00:12:31,822 --> 00:12:33,356
Yeah, yeah.

116
00:12:33,358 --> 00:12:35,679
How much further?

117
00:12:37,067 --> 00:12:39,492
About 22 more Taylor
Swift tracks, honey.

118
00:12:42,943 --> 00:12:44,533
- Daddy?
- Yes, Snoops?

119
00:12:44,535 --> 00:12:48,486
Did Taylor Swift's dad
threaten to kill her too?

120
00:12:48,488 --> 00:12:50,028
No, hon.

121
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:51,682
The music world is not that lucky

122
00:13:20,116 --> 00:13:22,031
I'm gonna go get the key.

123
00:13:22,033 --> 00:13:22,865
All right.

124
00:13:22,867 --> 00:13:25,653
This definitely isn't the Four Seasons.

125
00:13:25,655 --> 00:13:30,148
You know your
father, anything to save a buck,

126
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:31,448
but we are a mile from the venue,

127
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:32,846
so you know, that's good.

128
00:13:32,848 --> 00:13:33,952
- We're a mile away?
- Yeah.

129
00:13:33,954 --> 00:13:37,618
And there's cell service. Thank God.

130
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:39,036
Oh, let's go to the vending machine.

131
00:13:39,038 --> 00:13:41,283
Okay, we'll be back.

132
00:13:41,285 --> 00:13:42,991
Hello, Earth to Mother.

133
00:13:42,993 --> 00:13:44,477
Can you pass me in my bag?

134
00:13:46,524 --> 00:13:48,442
Your bag, yeah. Here.

135
00:14:21,642 --> 00:14:23,151
You're still staring
at the board, hey, Burke?

136
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:24,863
Tromer. Come on in.

137
00:14:24,865 --> 00:14:27,395
I was just dropping off the
report you requested, sir.

138
00:14:27,397 --> 00:14:30,493
Hmm? Oh, desk's fine.

139
00:14:35,245 --> 00:14:36,245
What's it say?

140
00:14:37,237 --> 00:14:38,237
Sir?

141
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,299
The report.

142
00:14:41,301 --> 00:14:44,482
Oh, uh, some lady on the
outskirts of town called in

143
00:14:44,484 --> 00:14:47,055
and said that some homeless man
was going through her trash.

144
00:14:47,057 --> 00:14:50,113
And then she changed her
story and it was a Bigfoot.

145
00:14:51,301 --> 00:14:53,206
Mm-hmm, and what do you think?

146
00:14:54,054 --> 00:14:56,690
Ah, if I had to guess,
I'd, I'd say a bear.

147
00:15:02,746 --> 00:15:04,132
Do you know how many people have died

148
00:15:04,134 --> 00:15:07,070
at the hands of Colin Miller?
- Colin Miller is dead.

149
00:15:11,211 --> 00:15:12,681
So show me his body.

150
00:15:12,683 --> 00:15:14,077
It's been 10 years.

151
00:15:16,687 --> 00:15:18,406
Four murders in the past 24 months,

152
00:15:18,408 --> 00:15:19,948
nine missing persons cases

153
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:23,011
from surrounding counties, all unsolved.

154
00:15:23,013 --> 00:15:25,734
And all unrelated, different motives,

155
00:15:25,736 --> 00:15:26,885
different causes of death.

156
00:15:26,887 --> 00:15:28,346
Hell, we caught the guy
who did one of them.

157
00:15:28,348 --> 00:15:29,399
It was the boyfriend.

158
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:32,741
That one was circumstantial
and you know it,

159
00:15:32,743 --> 00:15:35,078
All of these crimes
encircle Carpenter Falls.

160
00:15:37,397 --> 00:15:38,411
He's out there.

161
00:15:39,781 --> 00:15:43,117
Where, I don't know, but he's out there.

162
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:52,109
Today, we have got a marvelous guest.

163
00:15:52,111 --> 00:15:53,542
Oh, I'm just so excited.

164
00:15:53,544 --> 00:15:56,562
I wanna talk about the best
selling author with her hit,

165
00:15:56,564 --> 00:15:59,918
The story of Colin Miller."

166
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:04,142
Yes, look, The National Book
Club, an official selection.

167
00:16:04,144 --> 00:16:05,504
Whoop-whoop!
- Thank you.

168
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:07,052
- Oh yes, I'm just...
- Thank you for having me.

169
00:16:07,054 --> 00:16:08,697
Yes. I just wanna dive right in.

170
00:16:08,699 --> 00:16:11,119
Can we just do that?
- The story of Carpenter Falls

171
00:16:11,121 --> 00:16:13,301
- Mm, yes.
- Is a tragic one.

172
00:16:13,303 --> 00:16:15,463
- Mm.
- Okay, this is a town

173
00:16:15,465 --> 00:16:19,437
that has been marred
with horrifying events

174
00:16:19,439 --> 00:16:22,480
and there are a lot of
unanswered questions.

175
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:24,763
- Ooh.
- My book

176
00:16:24,765 --> 00:16:27,536
- Mm.
- Dives deep into the story

177
00:16:27,538 --> 00:16:32,060
and uncovers facts about the occult,

178
00:16:32,062 --> 00:16:33,415
the ritualistic blood sacrifices.

179
00:16:33,417 --> 00:16:34,417
Turn it.

180
00:16:35,384 --> 00:16:38,790
What are you doing?

181
00:16:38,792 --> 00:16:41,362
- Getting into character.
- Those people online

182
00:16:41,364 --> 00:16:44,803
were right, you are a poser.

183
00:16:44,805 --> 00:16:45,974
- Uncovered the truth about
- What?

184
00:16:45,976 --> 00:16:48,296
- The disappearances.
- Someone said I was a poser?

185
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:50,841
Kendall, cool it with the jumping.

186
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:53,317
I think it's best if you not do that.

187
00:16:53,319 --> 00:16:54,312
Am I the only one who thinks

188
00:16:54,314 --> 00:16:55,506
going into a terrain
- Poser.

189
00:16:55,508 --> 00:16:57,986
We know nothing
about without any knowledge

190
00:16:57,988 --> 00:16:59,320
of its conditions or schematics,

191
00:16:59,322 --> 00:17:00,869
- Okay.
- A little bit

192
00:17:00,871 --> 00:17:02,120
intimidating?
- Yeah,

193
00:17:02,122 --> 00:17:03,928
you know, I'd follow you into hell...

194
00:17:05,678 --> 00:17:07,884
But with this...

195
00:17:07,886 --> 00:17:08,886
Um...

196
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:11,339
How do I look?

197
00:17:11,341 --> 00:17:14,152
- Honey, it's...
- My Mom will kill me.

198
00:17:14,154 --> 00:17:15,193
Well, as it turns out, we might

199
00:17:15,195 --> 00:17:17,636
have a guide.
- Revealing.

200
00:17:17,638 --> 00:17:19,147
Mia Bates,
Helen Bates's daughter.

201
00:17:19,149 --> 00:17:20,989
- Oh my God.
- We're gonna track her down.

202
00:17:20,991 --> 00:17:22,643
Daniel, are you ready?

203
00:17:22,645 --> 00:17:23,992
Ready as I'm ever gonna be.

204
00:17:23,994 --> 00:17:27,566
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow your role, guys.

205
00:17:27,568 --> 00:17:29,497
Where are you going?
- I've seen this movie before.

206
00:17:29,499 --> 00:17:31,400
We're gonna get attacked by
some backwoods hillbillies.

207
00:17:31,402 --> 00:17:35,188
Well, we're just gonna
walk it to the venue.

208
00:17:37,029 --> 00:17:41,099
Now? But it doesn't
start for several hours.

209
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:42,101
Right.

210
00:17:43,313 --> 00:17:46,324
The band's already there
and we have rehearsals.

211
00:17:46,326 --> 00:17:48,293
But I wanted us all to go
get something to eat tonight.

212
00:17:48,295 --> 00:17:49,638
This seems
legitimately dangerous.

213
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:52,851
Oh, Mexican? We need more queso.

214
00:17:52,853 --> 00:17:55,193
- Oh God, no queso.
- Come on guys.

215
00:17:55,195 --> 00:17:56,351
You stick your grubby
little fingers in it,

216
00:17:56,353 --> 00:17:58,406
nobody can have any.

217
00:17:58,408 --> 00:17:59,928
Yeah, pass.

218
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:00,849
- Fuck it.
- I'll just get

219
00:18:00,851 --> 00:18:01,910
something at the venue.
- Let's do it.

220
00:18:01,912 --> 00:18:04,052
I'm sure they'll have concessions.

221
00:18:04,054 --> 00:18:06,725
Yeah, I'll probably
just grab a Power Bar.

222
00:18:06,727 --> 00:18:08,607
Don't eat anything to big
before my performance.

223
00:18:08,609 --> 00:18:10,861
- Be careful.
- Of course.

224
00:18:11,941 --> 00:18:12,966
It's cool. We get it.

225
00:18:12,968 --> 00:18:14,910
You two be careful.

226
00:18:14,912 --> 00:18:17,275
I am not comfortable with this.

227
00:18:17,277 --> 00:18:19,992
Geez, Mom, we're 17 and 18 years old.

228
00:18:19,994 --> 00:18:23,687
And 17 And 18 year olds go
missing all the time, Daniel.

229
00:18:23,689 --> 00:18:25,131
Alex.

230
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:32,621
Fine, but straight to the venue.

231
00:18:32,623 --> 00:18:33,652
Do you understand?
- Mm-hmm.

232
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:34,654
- Yep.
- Yeah.

233
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:39,818
They'll be fine. They got each other.

234
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:42,232
The three of us will go
get something to eat.

235
00:18:42,234 --> 00:18:44,420
Someplace with queso?

236
00:18:44,422 --> 00:18:46,508
Child, you're obsessed.

237
00:18:48,471 --> 00:18:50,135
Stopped answering my calls

238
00:18:50,137 --> 00:18:52,309
and you clearly didn't take my hint.

239
00:18:52,311 --> 00:18:54,313
They'll be good. Okay?

240
00:18:55,706 --> 00:18:56,745
Look, I
know what you're thinking,

241
00:18:56,747 --> 00:18:58,852
and no, I don't live here.

242
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:02,581
It's just somewhere I come
when I need to get away.

243
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:03,766
Clear my head.

244
00:19:10,322 --> 00:19:12,809
- Boo, you suck!
- Well, well, well.

245
00:19:12,811 --> 00:19:13,992
I thought I was gonna have to Phil Collins

246
00:19:13,994 --> 00:19:14,994
this shit tonight.

247
00:19:15,966 --> 00:19:17,015
Hey, hey.
- Hmm.

248
00:19:17,017 --> 00:19:18,266
Do you even know who that is?

249
00:19:18,268 --> 00:19:19,257
Of course I know who that is.

250
00:19:19,259 --> 00:19:21,199
- Hmm.
- "No Jacket Required"

251
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:24,462
was required listening in
my household growing up.

252
00:19:24,464 --> 00:19:27,055
The old man loved that Limey bastard.

253
00:19:27,057 --> 00:19:28,667
Dude, the Nova totally keeled over.

254
00:19:28,669 --> 00:19:30,118
- Fuck.
- Hopefully we have

255
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,700
a decent crowd tonight.

256
00:19:31,702 --> 00:19:33,079
I could use the fucking money.

257
00:19:33,081 --> 00:19:34,032
- Mm.
- And by the way,

258
00:19:34,034 --> 00:19:35,734
thanks for leaving me behind, dick.

259
00:19:35,736 --> 00:19:37,237
Well, don't be so damn late.

260
00:19:38,148 --> 00:19:39,067
I don't know, man.

261
00:19:39,069 --> 00:19:40,989
The dude said the pre-sales
were actually pretty rad,

262
00:19:40,991 --> 00:19:43,682
so we might have a full house tonight.

263
00:19:43,684 --> 00:19:44,803
Ooh, don't tell him that.

264
00:19:44,805 --> 00:19:47,305
He's had the bubble
guts the whole way here.

265
00:19:47,307 --> 00:19:49,788
Well, I didn't think you
were even gonna be here,

266
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:52,541
work or something.
- Mm, totally charmed

267
00:19:52,543 --> 00:19:53,438
my way out of it.
- Mm?

268
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,793
- Mm-hmm.
- Well you picked

269
00:19:54,795 --> 00:19:56,224
a pretty good one.

270
00:19:56,226 --> 00:19:58,517
I can feel it coming in the air tonight.

271
00:19:58,519 --> 00:20:01,753
Yes, that is an intentional
Phil Colland reference.

272
00:20:01,755 --> 00:20:02,681
- Mm.
- Mm.

273
00:20:02,683 --> 00:20:06,785
And the only pretty girl is
gonna be showing some support.

274
00:20:06,787 --> 00:20:08,366
- Holly.
- Hi.

275
00:20:08,368 --> 00:20:09,447
- Hey, how are you?
- Good.

276
00:20:09,449 --> 00:20:10,989
Thank God we made it.

277
00:20:10,991 --> 00:20:14,242
If I had to hear Holly mention
Daniel's name one more time,

278
00:20:14,244 --> 00:20:16,053
I was going to slip my own throat.

279
00:20:18,048 --> 00:20:18,927
How you doing today? You good?

280
00:20:18,929 --> 00:20:20,328
Good. Are you nervous?

281
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:22,581
Yeah, Pike said it's
gonna be a full house, so...

282
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:24,546
That's good for y'all, though.

283
00:20:24,548 --> 00:20:25,379
- Yeah.
- It'll be fun, it looks like

284
00:20:25,381 --> 00:20:26,598
a good venue.
- Yeah, it's really cool.

285
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,817
I love all the lights.

286
00:20:28,819 --> 00:20:30,729
It's cool. I'm excited.

287
00:20:30,731 --> 00:20:32,352
Me too. Thanks for coming.

288
00:20:32,354 --> 00:20:33,934
Yeah, I mean, Jenna would have killed me

289
00:20:33,936 --> 00:20:35,872
if I didn't come, so...
- Yeah.

290
00:20:35,874 --> 00:20:38,577
- I'm glad you came.
- Yeah, uh, me too.

291
00:20:50,828 --> 00:20:52,671
You know, I've driven more crazies

292
00:20:52,673 --> 00:20:54,973
across the Midwest than I care to mention.

293
00:20:54,975 --> 00:20:56,975
Hell, I'll be happy when
they transfer my ass

294
00:20:56,977 --> 00:20:58,747
in a couple weeks.
- You and me both.

295
00:20:58,749 --> 00:20:59,918
Having to listen to your crabby-ass

296
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,500
on these trips is excruciating.

297
00:21:01,502 --> 00:21:03,992
Uh, come on, man. Twisted clown killers.

298
00:21:03,994 --> 00:21:05,263
Crazy ex-lovers.

299
00:21:05,265 --> 00:21:08,196
Just about every other flavor
of insane you could imagine.

300
00:21:08,198 --> 00:21:10,150
It's like a Baskin-Robbins for loonies.

301
00:21:11,271 --> 00:21:13,502
So do you actually think
that these two did it?

302
00:21:13,504 --> 00:21:15,053
What, kill their folks?

303
00:21:15,055 --> 00:21:16,725
- Yeah.
- I mean,

304
00:21:16,727 --> 00:21:19,677
the rumor is that Miller
fuck made 'em do it.

305
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:21,449
The kids were scary.

306
00:21:21,451 --> 00:21:23,451
Gives me the heebie-jeebies
even thinking about it.

307
00:21:29,247 --> 00:21:30,649
I have nightmares all
the time about my son

308
00:21:30,651 --> 00:21:32,501
- killing me in my sleep.
- I would too.

309
00:21:32,503 --> 00:21:33,992
That creepy little bastard.

310
00:21:33,994 --> 00:21:35,794
Ever since I seen him,
I knew you were fucked.

311
00:21:40,165 --> 00:21:41,814
Oh, shit!

312
00:21:41,816 --> 00:21:44,605
Oh, holy fuck, man! Was that a woman?

313
00:21:44,607 --> 00:21:46,152
Shit! Wait in the van!

314
00:22:02,883 --> 00:22:04,442
Jesus.

315
00:22:04,444 --> 00:22:06,697
What happened to you, lady?

316
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:30,681
Hello?

317
00:22:36,933 --> 00:22:38,101
What the fuck?

318
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:11,525
They're dead!

319
00:23:11,527 --> 00:23:12,527
Oh!

320
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,623
That's the most terrifying
thing I've ever seen.

321
00:24:06,627 --> 00:24:09,087
No, you, you go ahead and finish it.

322
00:24:09,089 --> 00:24:11,904
I like my cheese dip finger-free
and less strep-throated.

323
00:24:19,349 --> 00:24:22,343
Honey, you okay? You want something eat?

324
00:24:22,345 --> 00:24:25,133
No, I just don't feel like eating.

325
00:24:25,135 --> 00:24:26,386
You can have something.

326
00:24:28,248 --> 00:24:30,400
You wanna go find me
a good, stiff drink?

327
00:24:33,375 --> 00:24:37,616
Look, I once heard it
said that you can't conquer

328
00:24:37,618 --> 00:24:39,486
what you can't confront.

329
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:44,693
Did you get that out
of a fortune cookie?

330
00:24:44,695 --> 00:24:46,685
- So, no.
- Mm.

331
00:24:46,687 --> 00:24:48,011
It's still good advice.

332
00:24:51,655 --> 00:24:53,366
Are you sure you don't want anything?

333
00:24:54,224 --> 00:24:56,304
Not unless you wanna get a big bag

334
00:24:56,306 --> 00:24:57,676
of those fortune cookies in case

335
00:24:57,678 --> 00:24:59,611
I need some more good advice.

336
00:24:59,613 --> 00:25:00,613
Mm-hmm.

337
00:25:05,659 --> 00:25:07,204
Did you get enough?

338
00:25:24,284 --> 00:25:28,892
The darkness takes
you, Makes you do things.

339
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:31,825
Corrupts your soul.

340
00:25:33,133 --> 00:25:34,873
One moment, I was all happy

341
00:25:34,875 --> 00:25:36,434
and the next,

342
00:25:36,436 --> 00:25:38,436
Horror, terror.
- Chief wants to see you.

343
00:25:38,438 --> 00:25:41,785
Once the darkness has
you, there's no escaping it.

344
00:25:49,351 --> 00:25:50,869
Chief, you wanted to see me?

345
00:25:50,871 --> 00:25:53,490
Come on in, Burke.
Close the door behind you.

346
00:26:03,179 --> 00:26:04,432
Do you mind telling me what's up

347
00:26:04,434 --> 00:26:05,794
with the Colin Miller shrine

348
00:26:05,796 --> 00:26:07,598
hanging on your wall in your office?

349
00:26:08,639 --> 00:26:10,564
Just research.

350
00:26:11,411 --> 00:26:12,981
Research?

351
00:26:12,983 --> 00:26:13,983
Yes, sir.

352
00:26:19,149 --> 00:26:21,239
Look Burke, I like you.

353
00:26:21,241 --> 00:26:22,541
You're one of my best officers.

354
00:26:22,543 --> 00:26:24,545
So I'm not gonna sugarcoat this for you.

355
00:26:26,306 --> 00:26:27,908
Your boys are worried about you.

356
00:26:28,849 --> 00:26:31,069
They think you're taking
this Miller obsession

357
00:26:31,071 --> 00:26:32,215
a little too far.

358
00:26:33,423 --> 00:26:35,445
Chief, I, I just...

359
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:43,957
This has brought a lot of
eyes onto Carpenter Falls again.

360
00:26:46,206 --> 00:26:51,064
Everything we do is under
the microscope, overanalyzed.

361
00:26:52,252 --> 00:26:54,533
Now the last thing we
need is a media shit-storm

362
00:26:54,535 --> 00:26:56,675
on how a police officer
believes the boogeyman

363
00:26:56,677 --> 00:27:00,128
is still out there biding his time,

364
00:27:00,130 --> 00:27:01,795
preparing to attack again.

365
00:27:07,027 --> 00:27:09,918
The blow-back from that
would be catastrophic.

366
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:13,081
Public panic, media surges.

367
00:27:13,083 --> 00:27:16,129
Have you ever seen evil, Chief Ellis?

368
00:27:20,961 --> 00:27:23,391
I know you have a personal
connection to this case.

369
00:27:23,393 --> 00:27:25,293
Dammit! It was my fault that he escaped!

370
00:27:25,295 --> 00:27:27,636
He did it on my watch!

371
00:27:27,638 --> 00:27:32,626
And that's, that's a fuck
up no one can ever fix.

372
00:27:35,786 --> 00:27:37,480
It is time to move on, Burke.

373
00:27:38,428 --> 00:27:41,289
Colin Miller is long gone.

374
00:27:41,291 --> 00:27:43,491
Now I am asking that you
take the contents down

375
00:27:43,493 --> 00:27:45,979
off your wall and put them away.

376
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:50,279
Are we clear?

377
00:28:11,247 --> 00:28:13,617
We're gonna kill something.

378
00:30:12,003 --> 00:30:14,012
I'm getting too old for this.

379
00:30:14,014 --> 00:30:15,108
That's obvious.

380
00:30:16,176 --> 00:30:17,881
Our boy's killing it though.

381
00:30:17,883 --> 00:30:20,809
I know. I'm so proud of proud of him.

382
00:30:20,811 --> 00:30:21,965
I'm proud of you.

383
00:30:24,568 --> 00:30:25,568
Um...

384
00:30:27,848 --> 00:30:31,519
Is it...

385
00:30:47,708 --> 00:30:49,197
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

386
00:30:49,199 --> 00:30:50,788
Okay.

387
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:53,291
Kendall, sweetie, do you
need to go to the bathroom?

388
00:30:53,293 --> 00:30:56,510
No way. This is my
favorite of Daniel's songs.

389
00:30:58,766 --> 00:31:00,935
Watch her. I'll be back.

390
00:31:54,033 --> 00:31:56,062
Get a grip, Alex.

391
00:31:56,064 --> 00:31:57,588
Get a fucking grip!

392
00:32:20,683 --> 00:32:21,683
Liv?

393
00:32:22,745 --> 00:32:24,528
You shouldn't have come here, Alex.

394
00:32:25,743 --> 00:32:27,886
I don't understand.

395
00:32:27,888 --> 00:32:31,369
You, your family.

396
00:32:31,371 --> 00:32:34,161
None of you are safe
here in Carpenter Falls.

397
00:32:39,402 --> 00:32:42,638
Leave this place, Alex.

398
00:32:57,183 --> 00:33:00,812
I gotta get outta here.

399
00:33:08,375 --> 00:33:10,667
I need to go. Keep an eye on them.

400
00:33:10,669 --> 00:33:12,504
Wait, what happened?

401
00:33:19,579 --> 00:33:21,291
Mommy, you're hurting my arm.

402
00:33:21,293 --> 00:33:22,293
Alex.

403
00:33:23,757 --> 00:33:26,275
What in God's name is going on?

404
00:33:26,277 --> 00:33:28,296
I gotta get outta here.

405
00:33:28,298 --> 00:33:30,362
I thought I could do this, but I can't.

406
00:33:32,921 --> 00:33:33,921
Mom?

407
00:33:36,316 --> 00:33:38,346
Guys, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

408
00:33:38,348 --> 00:33:42,092
I know I've let you
down, but I, I'm trying.

409
00:33:42,094 --> 00:33:43,679
I just can't do it.

410
00:33:45,391 --> 00:33:47,370
I'm just gonna get
her back to the motel.

411
00:33:47,372 --> 00:33:48,767
Yeah, that, that's okay.

412
00:33:48,769 --> 00:33:50,890
We'll just catch a ride back with them.

413
00:33:50,892 --> 00:33:51,813
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

414
00:33:51,815 --> 00:33:54,057
- Okay, good.
- I wanna stay too.

415
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:56,456
Uh...

416
00:34:03,053 --> 00:34:04,053
Hey, rascal.

417
00:34:06,056 --> 00:34:09,000
I need you to do me a solid
and go to the hotel with Mom.

418
00:34:09,002 --> 00:34:11,488
Well why do I have to do that?

419
00:34:11,490 --> 00:34:12,909
Why can't I stay?

420
00:34:14,073 --> 00:34:16,925
Don't tell Jenna, but you're secretly

421
00:34:16,927 --> 00:34:18,572
their favorite child.

422
00:34:18,574 --> 00:34:20,493
Well, I already kind of knew that.

423
00:34:21,852 --> 00:34:22,852
For me?

424
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:24,640
Please?

425
00:34:26,101 --> 00:34:27,101
Fine.

426
00:34:28,954 --> 00:34:31,957
It's gonna be, it's gonna be fine.

427
00:34:35,222 --> 00:34:37,536
I'm so sorry, Daniel.

428
00:34:37,538 --> 00:34:39,623
I know I've let you down. I'm so sorry.

429
00:34:40,473 --> 00:34:42,320
Mom, it's okay.

430
00:34:42,322 --> 00:34:43,386
You get a pass.

431
00:34:44,845 --> 00:34:46,479
You go. I'll be fine.

432
00:34:47,658 --> 00:34:49,687
I'll catch up with you guys
back to the motel later.

433
00:34:49,689 --> 00:34:51,279
Okay.

434
00:34:51,281 --> 00:34:52,281
It's okay.

435
00:34:53,133 --> 00:34:54,497
Come on, hon. Let's go.

436
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:56,884
Come on. I'm sorry.

437
00:34:56,886 --> 00:34:57,858
It's okay.

438
00:34:57,860 --> 00:34:59,064
You guys be careful.

439
00:34:59,066 --> 00:35:00,066
Okay.

440
00:35:28,153 --> 00:35:29,758
Every time you perform, it's like

441
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,462
I can't control myself.

442
00:35:31,464 --> 00:35:32,594
Because I'm fucking awesome.

443
00:35:54,918 --> 00:35:56,097
I want you so bad.

444
00:35:56,099 --> 00:35:57,934
Not as much as I do.

445
00:36:39,406 --> 00:36:41,344
You're gonna kill me.

446
00:36:41,346 --> 00:36:44,203
Oh my God. Don't tell
me you forgot a rubber.

447
00:36:44,205 --> 00:36:45,921
What? No.

448
00:36:45,923 --> 00:36:48,346
I just gotta piss real bad.
- Seriously?

449
00:36:48,348 --> 00:36:52,395
Just hold it or I can
go join Greg in shower.

450
00:36:52,397 --> 00:36:54,066
Shut the fuck up.

451
00:36:56,207 --> 00:36:57,207
Here

452
00:36:58,345 --> 00:37:00,819
Uh, better hurry or I'll
have to handle myself.

453
00:37:00,821 --> 00:37:02,258
Don't you fucking dare.

454
00:37:13,183 --> 00:37:16,767
Come on, fucker. We're
gonna have fun tonight.

455
00:37:18,356 --> 00:37:19,775
What, what is up?

456
00:37:51,675 --> 00:37:54,110
Holy fuck, you scared
the shit out of me.

457
00:37:55,736 --> 00:37:57,354
I should be going now.

458
00:37:59,369 --> 00:38:00,618
The room's all yours.

459
00:38:04,404 --> 00:38:07,316
I wanna play with you.

460
00:38:10,791 --> 00:38:13,721
Shh.

461
00:38:13,723 --> 00:38:14,723
Shh.

462
00:38:17,374 --> 00:38:21,128
God, no!

463
00:38:24,886 --> 00:38:26,957
Yes!

464
00:38:26,959 --> 00:38:29,277
Kill her for daddy! Kill her for daddy!

465
00:38:29,279 --> 00:38:32,933
You fucking freak.

466
00:38:32,935 --> 00:38:35,104
I wanna look pretty too.

467
00:38:38,481 --> 00:38:39,481
Help!

468
00:38:40,210 --> 00:38:41,210
Wait.

469
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,538
- Right here.
- What's this? No.

470
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:12,368
Yeah, I think it's...

471
00:39:12,370 --> 00:39:14,392
I'm an agony.

472
00:39:14,394 --> 00:39:15,428
She's killing me.

473
00:39:16,326 --> 00:39:17,327
I'm beat.

474
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:22,048
You know what the beautiful thing is?

475
00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:23,982
In some alternate universe,

476
00:39:23,984 --> 00:39:25,584
she's totally my girlfriend.

477
00:39:25,586 --> 00:39:28,797
Yeah, and then in another
universe, she's totally not.

478
00:39:28,799 --> 00:39:30,423
She's blown two other dudes.

479
00:39:31,822 --> 00:39:33,323
She's the girl in my dreams.

480
00:39:34,235 --> 00:39:37,961
Time. Speaking of dreams.

481
00:39:38,829 --> 00:39:40,544
So last night I had this dream.

482
00:39:41,682 --> 00:39:43,391
I go to college and I'm in my dorm

483
00:39:43,393 --> 00:39:46,745
and standing there is Carrie
Fisher, butt-ass naked.

484
00:39:46,747 --> 00:39:48,116
And I know she's dead and all,

485
00:39:48,118 --> 00:39:51,219
but it's like this weird social situation.

486
00:39:51,221 --> 00:39:53,473
I mean, she is Princess
Leia, for fuck sakes.

487
00:39:55,405 --> 00:39:57,911
But at the same time, it's
like, I'm fucking a zombie.

488
00:40:00,631 --> 00:40:01,855
You boned her.

489
00:40:02,956 --> 00:40:04,322
Tonight's the perfect night to make

490
00:40:04,324 --> 00:40:06,204
a move on her though, dude.

491
00:40:06,206 --> 00:40:08,096
And I mean, if that doesn't
work, you can always

492
00:40:08,098 --> 00:40:09,658
slip her one of those pixie sticks

493
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:11,234
and get that wet leg going.

494
00:40:14,524 --> 00:40:16,606
Tonight's the night.

495
00:40:16,608 --> 00:40:18,089
I'm gonna do it.

496
00:40:18,091 --> 00:40:19,447
Need some tips, bro?

497
00:40:19,449 --> 00:40:21,930
I can show you a thing or two.

498
00:40:21,932 --> 00:40:23,186
Fuck off.

499
00:40:24,054 --> 00:40:26,850
Hey, man. It's all in the hips.

500
00:40:27,968 --> 00:40:29,207
All right, on that note,

501
00:40:29,209 --> 00:40:30,899
let's get the rest of this shit packed up

502
00:40:30,901 --> 00:40:33,411
before he starts humping my guitar case.

503
00:40:33,413 --> 00:40:34,983
What about Pike and Blair?

504
00:40:34,985 --> 00:40:37,105
They left like 20, 30 minutes ago.

505
00:40:37,107 --> 00:40:39,377
Probably booty banging out
in the parking lot right now.

506
00:40:39,379 --> 00:40:41,790
Typical, the least
reliable asshole I know.

507
00:40:41,792 --> 00:40:44,262
Besides this asshole's Nova.

508
00:40:44,264 --> 00:40:47,025
- All right, fuck you guys.
- All right.

509
00:40:47,027 --> 00:40:48,027
I'm out.

510
00:41:09,692 --> 00:41:11,850
I feel so bad about Daniel.

511
00:41:11,852 --> 00:41:12,852
He understands.

512
00:41:13,727 --> 00:41:16,139
I wish, I wish that made me
feel better, but it doesn't.

513
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:20,143
You gotta stop beating
yourself up over this.

514
00:41:21,351 --> 00:41:24,543
We all knew it was a bad decision
for you to come back here.

515
00:41:24,545 --> 00:41:26,770
I tried to tell you, but you're stubborn.

516
00:41:27,628 --> 00:41:29,808
One of your better traits by the way.

517
00:41:29,810 --> 00:41:30,911
Well you were right.

518
00:41:31,982 --> 00:41:34,492
How does that taste
coming outta your mouth?

519
00:41:34,494 --> 00:41:37,400
Fucking terrible.

520
00:41:40,701 --> 00:41:42,786
Look, it's all to be expected.

521
00:41:43,844 --> 00:41:45,746
What we went through was unimaginable,

522
00:41:47,203 --> 00:41:48,812
but none of it, your fault.

523
00:41:54,254 --> 00:41:58,729
Chris, Quentin, Trevor, Olivia.

524
00:42:01,501 --> 00:42:02,703
Honey, they're all gone.

525
00:42:03,724 --> 00:42:08,729
And Olivia, I will never
forgive myself for that.

526
00:42:11,321 --> 00:42:13,406
You gotta let that shit go.

527
00:42:14,515 --> 00:42:16,617
That's the bad shit that's happened to us.

528
00:42:17,703 --> 00:42:20,005
You gotta focus on the
positive, all the good.

529
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:22,834
Your family adores you,

530
00:42:22,836 --> 00:42:25,018
your kids think you're over the moon.

531
00:42:26,276 --> 00:42:28,577
You got three amazing kids.

532
00:42:28,579 --> 00:42:30,781
Daniel's in a band and
stays out of trouble.

533
00:42:34,214 --> 00:42:38,156
Jenna goes to school and works,

534
00:42:38,158 --> 00:42:39,860
and she still wants to be at home.

535
00:42:41,041 --> 00:42:44,342
Kendall's funny. Cute.

536
00:42:44,344 --> 00:42:46,046
A little terrifying when she eats.

537
00:42:47,387 --> 00:42:48,897
And they all look like they're dad.

538
00:42:48,899 --> 00:42:51,540
So I'm calling it a win.

539
00:42:51,542 --> 00:42:53,223
You're lucky I love you.

540
00:42:55,203 --> 00:42:56,992
And I love you.

541
00:42:56,994 --> 00:42:58,796
Now let's get your mind on something

542
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:03,522
a little bit more stimulating.

543
00:43:03,524 --> 00:43:06,405
Like what? Oh, okay.

544
00:43:06,407 --> 00:43:10,792
Oh!

545
00:43:10,794 --> 00:43:11,851
Mm.

546
00:43:14,204 --> 00:43:15,897
Quit it. We gotta be quiet.

547
00:43:15,899 --> 00:43:16,965
Well I'll be quick and quiet.

548
00:43:16,967 --> 00:43:18,807
Besides, she's in a queso coma.

549
00:43:18,809 --> 00:43:20,270
She's not waking up anytime soon.

550
00:43:38,048 --> 00:43:39,713
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

551
00:43:41,632 --> 00:43:44,813
I can't believe we actually
just did that, but...

552
00:43:44,815 --> 00:43:45,815
But what?

553
00:43:46,837 --> 00:43:48,937
It's just a tad awkward with my sister

554
00:43:48,939 --> 00:43:51,009
and Valentine in the backseat.

555
00:43:51,011 --> 00:43:53,742
I mean, if the car starts
rocking, I'm outta here.

556
00:43:53,744 --> 00:43:55,343
There's a trail over there.

557
00:43:55,345 --> 00:43:56,697
Do you wanna go for a walk?

558
00:43:57,921 --> 00:43:59,472
What is it?

559
00:44:00,450 --> 00:44:02,803
You and hiking seem
like kind of an oxymoron.

560
00:44:03,714 --> 00:44:05,516
I was a girl scout for nine years.

561
00:44:07,157 --> 00:44:08,697
You were a girl scout?

562
00:44:08,699 --> 00:44:09,699
Sure was.

563
00:44:11,893 --> 00:44:13,932
You still got one of those vests?

564
00:44:13,934 --> 00:44:15,834
We could totally role play.

565
00:44:15,836 --> 00:44:19,417
So Daniel Lawson fantasizes
about little girl scouts?

566
00:44:19,419 --> 00:44:22,921
No, I'm fantasizing
about you and your vest

567
00:44:22,923 --> 00:44:24,583
trying to sell me your cookie.

568
00:44:24,585 --> 00:44:26,815
Oh, so now you want my cookie, huh?

569
00:44:26,817 --> 00:44:28,346
Maybe even your brownie.

570
00:44:28,348 --> 00:44:29,750
Stay away from my brownie.

571
00:44:31,387 --> 00:44:34,556
We can go for that walk though.

572
00:44:34,558 --> 00:44:36,004
Hey, where y'all about to go?

573
00:44:36,006 --> 00:44:37,783
- We'll be back.
- Yeah, you know

574
00:44:37,785 --> 00:44:41,038
black people don't belong in the woods?

575
00:44:41,927 --> 00:44:44,680
Everybody getting laid and shit.

576
00:44:45,907 --> 00:44:47,627
Guess it's time to loosen up the wrist.

577
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,022
- So I'm serious now.
- Mm-hmm.

578
00:44:54,049 --> 00:44:58,742
Have you given more thought
to, um, getting our own place?

579
00:44:58,744 --> 00:45:01,727
You know, leaving the
nest and getting a place

580
00:45:01,729 --> 00:45:05,837
with your boy Valentine?

581
00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:07,596
Of course I have.

582
00:45:07,598 --> 00:45:12,236
I just wanna make sure the time is right.

583
00:45:12,238 --> 00:45:14,680
It's just the time is right.

584
00:45:14,682 --> 00:45:17,636
I mean, all right. Think about this.

585
00:45:17,638 --> 00:45:22,363
We could fuck like jack
rabbits all day and all night.

586
00:45:22,365 --> 00:45:23,732
- Yeah?
- And not have to worry

587
00:45:23,734 --> 00:45:26,787
about your schizo mother walking in on us.

588
00:45:28,235 --> 00:45:29,787
What?

589
00:45:29,789 --> 00:45:31,757
Be nice.

590
00:45:31,759 --> 00:45:32,927
But she is.

591
00:45:33,778 --> 00:45:35,538
- Oh my God.
- I'm sorry.

592
00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:37,792
Listen, listen. Hey, hey.

593
00:45:40,271 --> 00:45:43,727
I just, I want
you more in my life,

594
00:45:45,235 --> 00:45:49,688
and in my bed more, and in my car more,

595
00:45:49,690 --> 00:45:53,090
- Mm?
- And in my shower more.

596
00:45:53,092 --> 00:45:54,677
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

597
00:45:58,849 --> 00:46:00,368
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

598
00:46:00,370 --> 00:46:04,763
Take it off. Mm.

599
00:46:04,765 --> 00:46:06,129
- Wait, wait.
- What?

600
00:46:08,358 --> 00:46:10,108
Is Weezer still out there?

601
00:46:10,110 --> 00:46:14,069
You know he's a perv and
he's fucking blending.

602
00:46:14,071 --> 00:46:17,503
What?

603
00:46:17,505 --> 00:46:19,006
Are you serious?

604
00:46:20,153 --> 00:46:22,844
Gonna get you wet like a gremlin.

605
00:46:25,225 --> 00:46:28,757
So what's the deal with
your mom and this place?

606
00:46:28,759 --> 00:46:30,524
She kinda flipped her shit earlier.

607
00:46:31,501 --> 00:46:33,338
It's not really something we talk about.

608
00:46:36,587 --> 00:46:38,016
You're gonna make me tell you, aren't you?

609
00:46:38,018 --> 00:46:40,298
I mean, I'm not gonna make you tell me,

610
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:41,952
but I would kind of like to know.

611
00:46:44,595 --> 00:46:46,046
Jenna and I were just kids.

612
00:46:47,097 --> 00:46:49,077
My parents and some
friends decided to head up

613
00:46:49,079 --> 00:46:53,080
to a property here for a
weekend away in Carpenter Falls.

614
00:46:54,665 --> 00:46:56,659
Some crazy dude from
here went on the warpath

615
00:46:56,661 --> 00:46:59,508
"Helter Skelter" style and
carved up their friends.

616
00:46:59,510 --> 00:47:00,747
My parents

617
00:47:00,749 --> 00:47:02,921
were the only survivors.

618
00:47:02,923 --> 00:47:05,974
Okay, yeah, I can see
why that would be something

619
00:47:05,976 --> 00:47:07,715
you don't wanna talk about.

620
00:47:07,717 --> 00:47:09,218
It messed mom up pretty bad.

621
00:47:10,055 --> 00:47:12,761
Apparently the dude was
into some cult-like stuff.

622
00:47:12,763 --> 00:47:14,823
Killed his parents as a boy and shit.

623
00:47:14,825 --> 00:47:16,945
Claimed some demon made him do it.

624
00:47:16,947 --> 00:47:17,947
That's awful.

625
00:47:18,889 --> 00:47:20,398
Dad seemed to have gotten over it fine,

626
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:22,786
but mom, not so much.

627
00:47:24,755 --> 00:47:25,755
Look.

628
00:47:28,312 --> 00:47:29,711
Oh, jackpot.

629
00:47:29,713 --> 00:47:31,880
What do you mean jackpot?

630
00:47:31,882 --> 00:47:33,481
This is creepy as shit.

631
00:47:33,483 --> 00:47:34,483
It's abandoned.

632
00:47:36,286 --> 00:47:37,816
Don't tell me you're actually afraid.

633
00:47:37,818 --> 00:47:39,988
I mean yeah, kind of.

634
00:47:39,990 --> 00:47:42,821
- It's an old, empty house.
- Exactly, old, empty house.

635
00:47:42,823 --> 00:47:46,244
It's probably full of
snakes and spiders and rats.

636
00:47:46,246 --> 00:47:48,181
Come on. I'll protect you, princess.

637
00:48:00,350 --> 00:48:02,615
Smells like mildew and bacon.

638
00:48:02,617 --> 00:48:05,094
It's not that bad.

639
00:48:05,096 --> 00:48:07,435
I really hope you don't think
you're getting laid in here.

640
00:48:07,437 --> 00:48:08,437
Why not?

641
00:48:09,369 --> 00:48:10,854
I'm joking. Chill.

642
00:48:12,170 --> 00:48:13,170
Oh, come on.

643
00:48:17,054 --> 00:48:21,146
I knew I shouldn't
have listened to my ma.

644
00:48:21,148 --> 00:48:24,843
"Don't get the guitar, Weezer.
Play the drums, Weezer.

645
00:48:24,845 --> 00:48:27,115
Girls dig the drummer, Weezer."

646
00:48:27,117 --> 00:48:29,207
Fucking piece of shit.

647
00:48:29,209 --> 00:48:31,189
Maybe if I got that guitar, I wouldn't be

648
00:48:31,191 --> 00:48:33,146
in these hillbilly-ass backwoods.

649
00:48:34,254 --> 00:48:35,754
I wouldn't be about to jerk off

650
00:48:35,756 --> 00:48:37,977
and I'll probably have any bitch I want.

651
00:48:43,013 --> 00:48:45,714
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

652
00:48:45,716 --> 00:48:46,910
A graveyard?

653
00:48:51,441 --> 00:48:53,225
Kasie Miller.

654
00:49:05,606 --> 00:49:08,311
I blaze here today in your honor.

655
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:12,460
I hope you were at least a
bad bitch when you were alive,

656
00:49:12,462 --> 00:49:14,132
because before this night's over,

657
00:49:14,134 --> 00:49:17,701
I'm gonna cover your grave
with my baby gravy.

658
00:49:20,380 --> 00:49:22,279
It's all a fucking pathetic

659
00:49:22,281 --> 00:49:24,906
I'm really about to beat
off to a dead bitch.

660
00:49:24,908 --> 00:49:27,078
It's a damn shame.

661
00:49:39,168 --> 00:49:40,464
Naughty girl

662
00:49:40,466 --> 00:49:42,479
No!

663
00:49:42,481 --> 00:49:44,237
- Naughty girl.
- No!

664
00:49:44,239 --> 00:49:46,992
Let me go!
- When he was reviled,

665
00:49:50,641 --> 00:49:54,357
he did not revile in return.

666
00:49:56,296 --> 00:49:57,701
When he suffered,

667
00:50:01,572 --> 00:50:06,577
he did not threaten, but entrusted.

668
00:50:08,078 --> 00:50:11,622
He who would judge him just.

669
00:50:17,007 --> 00:50:19,509
Fuck you, shoelace bandit.

670
00:50:21,660 --> 00:50:25,063
Shut the fuck up!

671
00:50:25,065 --> 00:50:27,736
What the fuck do you people want?

672
00:50:27,738 --> 00:50:30,978
I said, what the fuck do you people want?

673
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:32,623
Bill, watch out!

674
00:50:34,519 --> 00:50:36,637
Bill, no!

675
00:50:41,769 --> 00:50:42,769
Bill!

676
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:52,071
Don't worry.

677
00:50:52,073 --> 00:50:54,408
We'll take good care of her.

678
00:50:59,740 --> 00:51:02,631
I always love checking
out abandoned houses.

679
00:51:02,633 --> 00:51:04,739
If these walls could talk,

680
00:51:04,741 --> 00:51:07,425
I bet they have plenty of stories to tell.

681
00:51:07,427 --> 00:51:10,133
Yeah, somehow I don't think
this would be a good one.

682
00:51:14,114 --> 00:51:16,840
Oh, shit, Kasie. Fuck.

683
00:51:17,738 --> 00:51:19,778
I'm tired about this fucking
band getting no pussy.

684
00:51:19,780 --> 00:51:23,161
Making me bust up on a fucking grave.

685
00:51:23,163 --> 00:51:26,064
Oh shit. Fuck!

686
00:51:26,066 --> 00:51:28,622
Oh yeah. Here it comes, Kasie.

687
00:51:34,134 --> 00:51:36,099
Okay. That's enough
creepy for one night.

688
00:51:36,101 --> 00:51:38,909
Can we just go back to the car?

689
00:51:38,911 --> 00:51:41,246
Listen. Someone's coming.

690
00:51:42,536 --> 00:51:44,244
Okay. Turn the light off.

691
00:51:45,982 --> 00:51:46,982
Jenna.

692
00:51:50,758 --> 00:51:51,900
Daniel, what are you gonna do?

693
00:51:51,902 --> 00:51:53,842
- They have my sister.
- Yeah, no shit, Sherlock,

694
00:51:53,844 --> 00:51:55,183
but you can't just run out there.

695
00:51:55,185 --> 00:51:56,525
They'll kill you.
- Holly, that's my

696
00:51:56,527 --> 00:51:58,383
fucking sister.

697
00:51:58,385 --> 00:52:00,727
Daniel, you can't, that's suicide.

698
00:52:00,729 --> 00:52:02,516
Shit, fuck.

699
00:52:17,706 --> 00:52:18,874
Here I come!

700
00:52:23,727 --> 00:52:24,727
Whee!

701
00:52:36,113 --> 00:52:37,113
Shh.

702
00:52:43,413 --> 00:52:44,413
Boo!

703
00:52:59,456 --> 00:53:01,959
Daniel, don't open the door.

704
00:53:14,859 --> 00:53:17,704
Daniel, we can go call
somebody then can come back.

705
00:53:17,706 --> 00:53:19,207
Please, let's go.

706
00:53:21,351 --> 00:53:22,469
I can't leave her.

707
00:53:47,878 --> 00:53:49,207
There isn't much time, Alex.

708
00:53:49,209 --> 00:53:50,884
What are you talking about?

709
00:53:52,673 --> 00:53:53,673
Jenna?

710
00:53:54,635 --> 00:53:55,635
Alex.

711
00:53:57,774 --> 00:54:00,313
To save them, you'll have
to face your darkest fears.

712
00:54:23,143 --> 00:54:24,402
Your call has been forwarded

713
00:54:24,404 --> 00:54:25,906
to an automatic voice message.

714
00:54:30,971 --> 00:54:32,210
Your call has been forwarded

715
00:54:32,212 --> 00:54:34,134
to an automatic voice message.

716
00:54:36,327 --> 00:54:37,327
Fuck.

717
00:54:47,814 --> 00:54:50,252
What the hell is that?

718
00:55:12,804 --> 00:55:14,889
Look. Get a load of this.

719
00:55:19,126 --> 00:55:20,961
Maybe they hit a deer.

720
00:55:22,586 --> 00:55:25,589
You don't suspect foul play, do you?

721
00:55:29,218 --> 00:55:30,218
Maybe.

722
00:56:16,210 --> 00:56:18,045
- It's him.
- It's who?

723
00:56:19,061 --> 00:56:22,565
The guy I was telling you about earlier.

724
00:56:29,794 --> 00:56:31,329
We have to find Jenna.

725
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:54,052
Alex, what are you doing?

726
00:56:55,486 --> 00:56:58,634
Kids aren't back yet.
Think something's wrong.

727
00:56:58,636 --> 00:57:01,499
Maybe not. They're just
out doing what teenagers do.

728
00:57:01,501 --> 00:57:03,081
It's 2:00 AM, Adam.

729
00:57:03,083 --> 00:57:05,283
They should have been
back long before now.

730
00:57:05,285 --> 00:57:07,245
I can't get either one of
'em on their cell phones

731
00:57:07,247 --> 00:57:10,348
plus this dream or
warning or I don't know,

732
00:57:10,350 --> 00:57:11,386
call it whatever you wanna call it,

733
00:57:11,388 --> 00:57:13,802
but she's trying to tell me something.

734
00:57:13,804 --> 00:57:15,534
Who's trying to tell you what?

735
00:57:15,536 --> 00:57:19,207
Look, I know that
this sounds crazy, okay?

736
00:57:19,209 --> 00:57:21,368
But ever since we got back here,

737
00:57:21,370 --> 00:57:25,576
I've been seeing her and I know
it's not just a coincidence.

738
00:57:26,724 --> 00:57:30,008
Hey, you're gonna have
to help me out here.

739
00:57:30,010 --> 00:57:31,010
I'm not following.

740
00:57:35,555 --> 00:57:39,156
Olivia.

741
00:57:39,158 --> 00:57:41,540
Olivia. As in dead, Olivia?

742
00:57:41,542 --> 00:57:43,742
Look, I know how it sounds.

743
00:57:43,744 --> 00:57:44,873
No, I don't think you do

744
00:57:44,875 --> 00:57:47,410
She showed me the kids
at the old Miller house.

745
00:57:48,468 --> 00:57:49,788
- Alex.
- I know, okay?

746
00:57:49,790 --> 00:57:52,571
I know that this is
insane. Believe me, I do.

747
00:57:52,573 --> 00:57:56,254
But something is wrong. I can feel it.

748
00:57:56,256 --> 00:57:58,507
Is this is what we talked about earlier?

749
00:57:58,509 --> 00:58:00,890
No, dammit, this,

750
00:58:00,892 --> 00:58:02,544
this has nothing to do with that.

751
00:58:05,134 --> 00:58:07,581
Then this is nuts
then. That's what it is.

752
00:58:07,583 --> 00:58:08,887
You're talking

753
00:58:08,889 --> 00:58:11,284
to a ghost and shit, it's gotta stop.

754
00:58:12,352 --> 00:58:14,663
I have to protect them.

755
00:58:14,665 --> 00:58:17,490
From who? He's dead.

756
00:58:18,739 --> 00:58:20,624
I have to be sure, Adam.

757
00:58:22,103 --> 00:58:23,432
Fine.

758
00:58:23,434 --> 00:58:24,613
You wanna be chained to Colin Miller

759
00:58:24,615 --> 00:58:27,015
for the rest of your life, go ahead.

760
00:58:27,017 --> 00:58:28,466
I refuse.
- And what is that

761
00:58:28,468 --> 00:58:30,819
supposed to mean?
- It means look at what

762
00:58:30,821 --> 00:58:32,861
this is doing to your children.

763
00:58:32,863 --> 00:58:36,124
They shouldn't have to see
the mom going through this.

764
00:58:36,126 --> 00:58:38,877
If you can't get past it for yourself,

765
00:58:38,879 --> 00:58:40,574
get past it for them at least.

766
00:58:42,283 --> 00:58:44,889
But what if I can't?

767
00:58:44,891 --> 00:58:46,430
I don't know how!

768
00:58:57,768 --> 00:58:59,520
Come here. Come on.

769
00:59:08,989 --> 00:59:11,525
You act like like if I
wasn't even there with you,

770
00:59:13,113 --> 00:59:15,465
like I didn't go through
the same shit you did.

771
00:59:16,817 --> 00:59:20,023
When I look in the mirror
every day, I see the scars.

772
00:59:21,612 --> 00:59:23,764
I know what that monster
did to our family,

773
00:59:24,905 --> 00:59:28,258
but I made a choice to move on

774
00:59:31,692 --> 00:59:32,893
because my kids need me,

775
00:59:34,138 --> 00:59:36,029
and goddammit, I need my kids.

776
00:59:38,443 --> 00:59:39,443
I know.

777
00:59:40,362 --> 00:59:42,558
I know. I'm sorry.

778
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:46,429
I'm sorry. This is total bullshit.

779
00:59:48,118 --> 00:59:49,998
I just want this to be over.

780
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,164
I want you to be okay.

781
00:59:53,965 --> 00:59:54,965
Okay.

782
00:59:56,610 --> 00:59:58,328
I'll try harder, I promise.

783
01:00:04,724 --> 01:00:09,092
Look, I think I'm just
gonna go for a walk.

784
01:00:10,250 --> 01:00:12,205
I just wanna go clear my head.

785
01:00:13,574 --> 01:00:17,165
Get some air, maybe a cup of coffee.

786
01:00:17,167 --> 01:00:18,896
You, you want one?

787
01:00:20,473 --> 01:00:22,811
I wouldn't say no to a cup of coffee

788
01:00:22,813 --> 01:00:24,484
or whiskey at this point.

789
01:00:24,486 --> 01:00:27,390
Okay. Okay.

790
01:00:28,415 --> 01:00:29,714
You want me to come with you?

791
01:00:29,716 --> 01:00:30,716
No, no.

792
01:00:33,190 --> 01:00:35,025
I just wanna be alone.

793
01:00:36,716 --> 01:00:38,818
Plus, I don't want you to wake up Kendall.

794
01:00:41,379 --> 01:00:42,463
I'll be fine.

795
01:00:43,466 --> 01:00:44,466
Okay.

796
01:00:49,405 --> 01:00:51,003
I love you.

797
01:00:51,005 --> 01:00:52,423
I love you too.

798
01:01:02,792 --> 01:01:06,907
We love

799
01:01:08,188 --> 01:01:10,654
because he first loved us.

800
01:01:13,991 --> 01:01:16,714
I promise you'll love her.

801
01:01:17,836 --> 01:01:22,149
And I would say you're
a nasty Carrie.

802
01:01:25,850 --> 01:01:30,319
Do you ever hear the voices?

803
01:01:30,321 --> 01:01:33,401
Hmm? You hear the voices?

804
01:01:33,403 --> 01:01:35,593
You do.

805
01:01:35,595 --> 01:01:37,514
You do, you do, you do.

806
01:01:39,533 --> 01:01:40,701
- No.
- You do!

807
01:01:41,816 --> 01:01:45,707
Because, because we all hear the voices.

808
01:01:47,128 --> 01:01:50,064
Even, even you.

809
01:01:50,066 --> 01:01:53,152
Oh, you turn your back on the voices.

810
01:01:55,669 --> 01:02:00,674
Why? I don't know why.

811
01:02:00,959 --> 01:02:03,253
You need bloody listen!

812
01:02:03,255 --> 01:02:05,045
- No, no!
- Huh?

813
01:02:05,047 --> 01:02:07,741
Oh, and they want me to do

814
01:02:07,743 --> 01:02:08,907
No, please.

815
01:02:08,909 --> 01:02:11,078
Horrible, horrible things.

816
01:02:16,917 --> 01:02:18,001
Do you, uh...

817
01:02:19,776 --> 01:02:21,360
Oh, you're so warm.

818
01:02:22,539 --> 01:02:24,123
Don't fight.
- No.

819
01:02:26,956 --> 01:02:28,602
Don't fight, don't fight.

820
01:02:28,604 --> 01:02:30,017
Please, please.

821
01:02:30,019 --> 01:02:32,187
No, don't fight.

822
01:02:32,189 --> 01:02:33,936
No, no, no.

823
01:02:33,938 --> 01:02:36,071
- It'll hurt less.
- No!

824
01:02:36,073 --> 01:02:39,600
No, no!

825
01:02:43,996 --> 01:02:45,424
Please, please don't.

826
01:02:46,828 --> 01:02:48,752
It's Jenna.

827
01:02:48,754 --> 01:02:49,754
No!

828
01:03:01,836 --> 01:03:02,836
Fuck!

829
01:03:04,931 --> 01:03:07,517
Fuck!

830
01:03:10,087 --> 01:03:14,458
Fuck!

831
01:03:17,758 --> 01:03:19,299
- Ow.
- Daniel here.

832
01:03:22,353 --> 01:03:24,786
- It's okay.
- You okay?

833
01:03:24,788 --> 01:03:27,457
We're gonna get you out of here.

834
01:03:29,008 --> 01:03:30,768
Come on. It's okay.

835
01:03:58,665 --> 01:04:00,489
You're okay.

836
01:04:00,491 --> 01:04:01,993
Yay, new lovers!

837
01:04:22,506 --> 01:04:24,813
Officer, I need your
help. My kids are missing.

838
01:04:24,815 --> 01:04:25,984
Ma'am, what's going on?

839
01:04:25,986 --> 01:04:28,056
They, they disappeared and
I think they're in trouble.

840
01:04:28,058 --> 01:04:29,988
Oh, okay. How long they've been missing?

841
01:04:29,990 --> 01:04:31,349
I, I don't know. A few hours.

842
01:04:31,351 --> 01:04:34,329
Okay. 48 hours is typical
for missing persons report.

843
01:04:34,331 --> 01:04:36,314
Fuck that!

844
01:04:36,316 --> 01:04:38,567
I need your help now!

845
01:04:38,569 --> 01:04:40,644
And I need you to calm down.

846
01:04:42,875 --> 01:04:44,738
Fine.

847
01:04:47,177 --> 01:04:49,479
Listen, I know that this
is gonna sound crazy,

848
01:04:50,811 --> 01:04:53,732
but I think they're at
the old Miller house.

849
01:04:53,734 --> 01:04:56,840
The Miller house?

850
01:04:58,776 --> 01:05:00,483
You fucking listen to me!

851
01:05:01,734 --> 01:05:03,862
I need your help now!

852
01:05:03,864 --> 01:05:07,701
And I need you to take
your hands off of me.

853
01:05:09,039 --> 01:05:11,454
Alex, Alex Curtis?

854
01:05:16,887 --> 01:05:17,887
Lawson.

855
01:05:18,649 --> 01:05:21,740
Yeah, whatever. What the
hell is going on out here?

856
01:05:21,742 --> 01:05:23,742
No idea, she came
barging through the door,

857
01:05:23,744 --> 01:05:24,993
said her kids were at the Miller house, I-

858
01:05:24,995 --> 01:05:26,705
Look, my kids are missing, and I think

859
01:05:26,707 --> 01:05:28,356
they're at the old
Miller house in trouble.

860
01:05:28,358 --> 01:05:29,778
Have you taken her statement?

861
01:05:29,780 --> 01:05:30,749
- No, I haven't.
- Yeah,

862
01:05:30,751 --> 01:05:31,583
hard to believe, right?

863
01:05:31,585 --> 01:05:33,196
Look, before we do anything,

864
01:05:33,198 --> 01:05:34,132
we're gonna have to sort through-

865
01:05:34,134 --> 01:05:36,394
We don't have time to
sort through shit, okay?

866
01:05:36,396 --> 01:05:38,657
We need to go, please!

867
01:05:38,659 --> 01:05:41,179
Look, you can do this with my help

868
01:05:41,181 --> 01:05:42,761
or you can do it on your own.

869
01:05:42,763 --> 01:05:43,763
It's up to you.

870
01:05:59,230 --> 01:06:01,494
Daniel. Daniel!

871
01:06:03,353 --> 01:06:04,353
Can you hear me?

872
01:06:11,030 --> 01:06:13,061
Where are we?

873
01:06:13,063 --> 01:06:18,068
I don't know.

874
01:06:45,118 --> 01:06:48,038
I'm gonna hurt you, Colin Miller?

875
01:06:50,852 --> 01:06:51,852
Hi kids.

876
01:06:56,906 --> 01:06:57,906
Yes.

877
01:07:02,082 --> 01:07:03,772
Don't you fucking touch her.

878
01:07:03,774 --> 01:07:06,429
Oh, you are so dramatic.

879
01:07:12,358 --> 01:07:14,878
Ooh, look at 'em, look at 'em go.

880
01:07:22,419 --> 01:07:24,884
What are you gonna do to me?

881
01:07:24,886 --> 01:07:27,857
I'm just gonna get you all clean.

882
01:07:31,356 --> 01:07:32,775
Oh no. Don't cry.

883
01:07:34,981 --> 01:07:38,017
If you cry then I'm gonna cry.

884
01:07:45,815 --> 01:07:48,305
Oh, this is so much fun.

885
01:07:58,549 --> 01:08:01,004
All clean.

886
01:08:02,583 --> 01:08:04,007
All clean for daddy.

887
01:08:07,333 --> 01:08:09,217
I should be home in bed.

888
01:08:09,219 --> 01:08:10,849
Not dealing with this.

889
01:08:10,851 --> 01:08:12,200
Chief, you didn't
have to come down here.

890
01:08:12,202 --> 01:08:13,461
I could have handled this.

891
01:08:13,463 --> 01:08:16,635
Excuse me. When can I see my wife?

892
01:08:16,637 --> 01:08:18,326
Thank you for coming down, Mr. Lawson.

893
01:08:18,328 --> 01:08:21,389
Just give us a few with your
wife and we'll get back to you.

894
01:08:21,391 --> 01:08:22,391
Thank you.

895
01:08:23,180 --> 01:08:24,713
What are we gonna do with her?

896
01:08:24,715 --> 01:08:26,663
You tell me, kiddo.

897
01:08:28,999 --> 01:08:31,835
Alex, long time. No, see.

898
01:08:33,271 --> 01:08:34,271
Chief.

899
01:08:35,465 --> 01:08:37,726
I'd say it we're good
to see you if it were

900
01:08:37,728 --> 01:08:39,502
under any other circumstances.

901
01:08:43,213 --> 01:08:44,693
All right.

902
01:08:44,695 --> 01:08:46,194
Why don't we start with you telling me

903
01:08:46,196 --> 01:08:47,942
why you are back here in Carpenter Falls?

904
01:08:47,944 --> 01:08:50,228
It doesn't matter why I'm back.

905
01:08:50,230 --> 01:08:52,050
My kids are missing.

906
01:08:52,052 --> 01:08:54,484
Okay. When did they go missing?

907
01:08:54,486 --> 01:08:56,389
After the music thing downtown.

908
01:08:58,048 --> 01:08:59,878
I think they're at the old Miller house.

909
01:08:59,880 --> 01:09:01,429
We actually found a
car tonight abandoned

910
01:09:01,431 --> 01:09:02,457
about a mile from the Miller property.

911
01:09:02,459 --> 01:09:04,593
It was a white Toyota.

912
01:09:04,595 --> 01:09:06,184
Had the back window broken out.

913
01:09:06,186 --> 01:09:08,639
Oh my God, that's them.
They were with friends.

914
01:09:10,120 --> 01:09:14,563
Okay, Alex, I
shouldn't be telling you this

915
01:09:14,565 --> 01:09:16,230
given your connection to this case.

916
01:09:16,232 --> 01:09:17,280
Telling me what?

917
01:09:18,769 --> 01:09:20,799
The Mathis siblings escaped during

918
01:09:20,801 --> 01:09:25,213
a transfer this evening,
people were killed.

919
01:09:25,215 --> 01:09:26,915
Now we don't know this for sure,

920
01:09:26,917 --> 01:09:28,236
but there's a chance they could be

921
01:09:28,238 --> 01:09:29,234
heading back to Carpenter Falls.

922
01:09:29,236 --> 01:09:30,618
Oh my, oh my God.

923
01:09:31,672 --> 01:09:33,842
Now we have every
available officer in town

924
01:09:33,844 --> 01:09:36,835
looking for them, and
we don't know for sure.

925
01:09:36,837 --> 01:09:38,797
I have to find my kids!

926
01:09:38,799 --> 01:09:41,250
Okay. And we're gonna help you.

927
01:09:41,252 --> 01:09:42,541
Then quit fucking around

928
01:09:42,543 --> 01:09:45,133
and get me to the old Miller house.

929
01:09:45,135 --> 01:09:50,140
I'll take her. I mean,
I'll accompany her.

930
01:09:50,430 --> 01:09:51,499
Not alone, you won't.

931
01:09:51,501 --> 01:09:54,663
Tromer, you go with Burke.

932
01:09:54,665 --> 01:09:57,513
See if you guys can locate the kids.

933
01:10:07,522 --> 01:10:10,559
You get lost on your
way to the coffee shop?

934
01:10:10,561 --> 01:10:11,765
What the hell's going on?

935
01:10:16,166 --> 01:10:18,106
It's the kids.

936
01:10:18,108 --> 01:10:22,153
They found Valentine's car out
by the old Miller property.

937
01:10:22,155 --> 01:10:23,771
What?

938
01:10:23,773 --> 01:10:27,355
Adam, the Mathis kids escaped.

939
01:10:27,357 --> 01:10:28,517
There's been murders.

940
01:10:28,519 --> 01:10:30,170
We have to find Daniel and Jenna.

941
01:10:37,257 --> 01:10:39,120
We're gonna go out there now.

942
01:10:39,122 --> 01:10:40,223
Me and those officers.

943
01:10:41,431 --> 01:10:44,252
Okay, well I'm coming with.

944
01:10:44,254 --> 01:10:45,254
Can I come?

945
01:10:47,417 --> 01:10:48,417
Baby bug.

946
01:10:49,770 --> 01:10:52,748
Oh, here. Let me save you some time.

947
01:10:52,750 --> 01:10:55,623
"Kendall, you can't go with us."

948
01:10:58,438 --> 01:10:59,438
Correct.

949
01:11:00,250 --> 01:11:01,802
Where we're going is dangerous.

950
01:11:02,663 --> 01:11:05,493
What's going on anyways?
Where's Daniel and Jenna?

951
01:11:05,495 --> 01:11:08,291
Sweetie, we're going to
get them right now. Okay?

952
01:11:09,329 --> 01:11:11,231
Are they gonna be grounded?

953
01:11:11,233 --> 01:11:12,716
For life.

954
01:11:14,575 --> 01:11:16,508
I wanna come with you guys.

955
01:11:16,510 --> 01:11:18,627
I know. I'm sorry.

956
01:11:18,629 --> 01:11:20,328
But we won't be gone very long.

957
01:11:20,330 --> 01:11:24,442
Stay here, watch TV, eat
donuts, drink coffee.

958
01:11:24,444 --> 01:11:25,444
We'll be back soon.

959
01:11:28,529 --> 01:11:29,529
Love you, girl.

960
01:11:32,106 --> 01:11:33,426
I love you, baby bug.

961
01:11:34,785 --> 01:11:36,104
We'll see you in little bit. Okay?

962
01:11:36,106 --> 01:11:37,616
Go with this nice lady.

963
01:11:37,618 --> 01:11:38,747
Yeah. Yeah.

964
01:11:38,749 --> 01:11:43,441
I better get rewarded for
this, like major rewarded.

965
01:11:43,443 --> 01:11:44,889
Anything you want.

966
01:11:44,891 --> 01:11:47,190
It's gonna be expensive.

967
01:11:48,178 --> 01:11:49,479
I'd expect nothing less.

968
01:11:53,270 --> 01:11:54,785
All clean.

969
01:11:54,787 --> 01:11:55,927
Holly.

970
01:12:04,390 --> 01:12:05,892
Please don't hurt her. Please.

971
01:12:07,563 --> 01:12:09,838
Please, please.

972
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:12,743
And I thought you knew how
this would end for each of you.

973
01:12:13,814 --> 01:12:17,470
But who goes first?

974
01:12:21,742 --> 01:12:23,757
Holly, Holly, Holly, Holly.

975
01:12:28,498 --> 01:12:31,024
You can do whatever you
want to me, just let her go.

976
01:12:32,653 --> 01:12:34,563
Please?
- Daniel, no!

977
01:12:34,565 --> 01:12:35,565
Shut up, Jenna!

978
01:12:39,391 --> 01:12:40,391
Please.

979
01:12:41,815 --> 01:12:44,128
No, stop!

980
01:12:44,130 --> 01:12:45,214
Colin, stop.

981
01:12:47,558 --> 01:12:48,949
Please, just stop.

982
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:53,915
Colin, please stop!

983
01:12:55,374 --> 01:12:58,018
Just stop, Colin, please,
just stop!

984
01:13:01,022 --> 01:13:04,923
He can't save you. You're all alone.

985
01:13:04,925 --> 01:13:08,344
And it's telling me to spill
your putrid fucking guts!

986
01:13:09,761 --> 01:13:11,652
Fuck yes!

987
01:13:42,292 --> 01:13:43,666
Hmm.

988
01:13:43,668 --> 01:13:45,583
Holly!

989
01:13:45,585 --> 01:13:46,585
No!

990
01:13:54,493 --> 01:13:55,493
Holly!

991
01:14:04,098 --> 01:14:05,098
Holly.

992
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:07,719
Holly.

993
01:14:35,325 --> 01:14:37,781
I did it. Killed her.

994
01:14:39,262 --> 01:14:40,262
I killed them all.

995
01:14:50,120 --> 01:14:52,452
Oh fuck, I'm a killer.

996
01:14:55,104 --> 01:14:57,244
I'll be fucking damned.

997
01:14:57,246 --> 01:14:59,749
So this is what it feels like.

998
01:15:01,926 --> 01:15:04,468
I said I fucking killed
them! They're all dead!

999
01:16:08,286 --> 01:16:09,621
Daniel? Jenna?

1000
01:16:12,590 --> 01:16:13,841
Oh God.
- Kids!

1001
01:16:16,408 --> 01:16:17,577
Daniel! Jenna!

1002
01:16:19,843 --> 01:16:21,482
How far is the Miller house from here?

1003
01:16:21,484 --> 01:16:23,486
It's less than a mile.

1004
01:16:26,261 --> 01:16:29,097
Oh, oh, Holly! Oh, Holly, Holly!

1005
01:16:30,369 --> 01:16:33,510
Holly, Holly, Holly!
- Don't you fucking touch her!

1006
01:16:33,512 --> 01:16:35,604
- Don't you touch her!
- I'll fucking kill you!

1007
01:16:35,606 --> 01:16:37,355
He might kill me.

1008
01:16:37,357 --> 01:16:39,765
Oh, do it. Come on, come
on, come on, come on.

1009
01:16:39,767 --> 01:16:42,423
- I'm gonna fucking do it!
- No, Holly, oh, poor Holly.

1010
01:16:42,425 --> 01:16:44,905
Oh, where you going? No.

1011
01:16:44,907 --> 01:16:46,223
Get off!

1012
01:16:46,225 --> 01:16:48,818
You wanna know what
Holly tastes like?

1013
01:16:48,820 --> 01:16:49,820
No, no!

1014
01:16:51,494 --> 01:16:54,511
Taste her, taste
her, see what she tastes like.

1015
01:16:54,513 --> 01:16:55,847
Jenna! Jenna!

1016
01:16:59,224 --> 01:17:02,305
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

1017
01:17:03,207 --> 01:17:05,178
- Jenna, run!
- Oh yes.

1018
01:17:05,180 --> 01:17:06,666
- Go!
- No, no,

1019
01:17:06,668 --> 01:17:08,681
no, Jenna, really.

1020
01:17:08,683 --> 01:17:11,575
Jenna, bad, bad girl.

1021
01:17:12,422 --> 01:17:14,605
- Jenna, just go.
- You better run.

1022
01:17:15,475 --> 01:17:19,813
Jenna, run.

1023
01:17:21,381 --> 01:17:23,341
Oh Holly, do you miss Holly?

1024
01:17:23,343 --> 01:17:24,506
Look, here's Holly right here.

1025
01:17:24,508 --> 01:17:27,829
Did you ever taste Holly? Oh.

1026
01:17:27,831 --> 01:17:32,095
She really, she tastes
good, doesn't she?

1027
01:17:34,660 --> 01:17:35,866
Mm.
- Oh.

1028
01:17:35,868 --> 01:17:38,409
- Jenna, run!
- Jenna, run!

1029
01:17:38,411 --> 01:17:40,837
One, two...

1030
01:17:40,839 --> 01:17:44,553
You're so cute.

1031
01:17:52,736 --> 01:17:53,736
Let's go.

1032
01:18:01,240 --> 01:18:02,823
The basement, Alex.

1033
01:18:13,663 --> 01:18:14,953
There ain't nothing here.

1034
01:18:14,955 --> 01:18:16,039
They're here, Adam.

1035
01:18:17,751 --> 01:18:20,203
This is exactly what she
showed me in the vision.

1036
01:18:23,303 --> 01:18:24,303
Check the door.

1037
01:18:36,562 --> 01:18:38,230
Burke, the basement!

1038
01:18:42,916 --> 01:18:47,921
Mm.

1039
01:18:50,621 --> 01:18:51,621
Alex.

1040
01:18:55,516 --> 01:18:57,816
Just be careful firing
that thing down there.

1041
01:18:57,818 --> 01:18:59,251
Could cause an explosion.

1042
01:18:59,253 --> 01:19:00,253
Okay.

1043
01:19:07,458 --> 01:19:12,115
Oh, are you worried
about your big sister?

1044
01:19:14,625 --> 01:19:19,127
You can't imagine the
things that I did to her.

1045
01:19:19,129 --> 01:19:20,719
And my sister,

1046
01:19:20,721 --> 01:19:25,659
oh, she's gonna do so much more.

1047
01:19:27,010 --> 01:19:30,038
I thought your freaks
were supposed to be mutes.

1048
01:19:30,040 --> 01:19:31,319
You talk too much.

1049
01:19:31,321 --> 01:19:35,536
You hurt my little feelings,
but it's okay,

1050
01:19:38,028 --> 01:19:42,125
because everything that
I did to your sister,

1051
01:19:43,369 --> 01:19:48,125
I'm gonna do so much worse.

1052
01:19:51,832 --> 01:19:55,305
Fucking try it, Buffalo Bill.

1053
01:19:58,955 --> 01:20:02,012
Oh, tastes like Holly.

1054
01:20:04,235 --> 01:20:06,422
Holly, mm, Holly.

1055
01:20:11,111 --> 01:20:16,023
Yeah, there he is!

1056
01:20:49,218 --> 01:20:50,218
No!

1057
01:20:58,445 --> 01:21:00,133
Drop the knife!

1058
01:21:00,135 --> 01:21:01,386
Drop the knife!

1059
01:21:13,969 --> 01:21:15,220
Jenna. Jenna.

1060
01:21:16,192 --> 01:21:17,193
It's okay.

1061
01:21:19,123 --> 01:21:24,128
They killed everybody.

1062
01:21:32,756 --> 01:21:36,638
Jenna, Jenna, baby, where's you brother?

1063
01:21:36,640 --> 01:21:37,974
They have him.

1064
01:21:41,550 --> 01:21:43,111
Have to get her up.

1065
01:21:45,756 --> 01:21:47,275
Adam, she's really hurt.

1066
01:21:47,277 --> 01:21:48,742
Can, can you walk?

1067
01:21:49,627 --> 01:21:50,731
My legs.

1068
01:21:50,733 --> 01:21:52,652
This is Burke. This is,
I need, this is Burke.

1069
01:21:52,654 --> 01:21:55,530
I need to back up. Goddamn,
I can't get a signal.

1070
01:21:55,532 --> 01:21:57,405
Me either.

1071
01:21:57,407 --> 01:21:59,327
Look, I know you wanna find your son,

1072
01:21:59,329 --> 01:22:00,629
but we need to get her out of here.

1073
01:22:00,631 --> 01:22:02,801
She needs medical attention.
- No, I am not

1074
01:22:02,803 --> 01:22:04,203
leaving here without my son.

1075
01:22:04,205 --> 01:22:06,808
Alex, he's right. She
needs to go to the hospital.

1076
01:22:10,096 --> 01:22:12,911
Tromer, you go with Mr.
Lawson and his daughter.

1077
01:22:12,913 --> 01:22:15,023
When you get to service, call for backup.

1078
01:22:15,025 --> 01:22:17,773
Alex and I will find your son.

1079
01:22:17,775 --> 01:22:19,287
No, Alex, you take her.

1080
01:22:19,289 --> 01:22:21,640
No, I can't. I can't carry her.

1081
01:22:21,642 --> 01:22:23,301
She's too heavy. You have to do it.

1082
01:22:23,303 --> 01:22:24,743
I'm not leaving you down here.

1083
01:22:24,745 --> 01:22:27,511
I am not leaving here
without both of our children!

1084
01:22:29,191 --> 01:22:31,026
All right. Come on.

1085
01:22:35,190 --> 01:22:36,525
Goddammit, Alex.

1086
01:22:37,987 --> 01:22:39,527
Go.

1087
01:23:41,801 --> 01:23:43,886
Uh, I am the boogeyman.

1088
01:23:56,050 --> 01:23:59,278
How many are left? Check that.

1089
01:23:59,280 --> 01:24:01,941
Shit.

1090
01:24:01,943 --> 01:24:03,679
There's no bullets.

1091
01:24:06,152 --> 01:24:07,921
What is that?

1092
01:24:07,923 --> 01:24:08,923
Shit.

1093
01:24:10,244 --> 01:24:11,244
Yeah.

1094
01:24:26,048 --> 01:24:28,776
It's okay, baby, it's okay.

1095
01:24:28,778 --> 01:24:32,504
You guys wait here. I'm gonna
make sure everything's okay.

1096
01:24:32,506 --> 01:24:34,206
It's all right, sweetie.

1097
01:24:34,208 --> 01:24:36,210
He's gonna check it out.

1098
01:24:38,738 --> 01:24:40,684
The coast is clear.

1099
01:24:42,315 --> 01:24:43,969
- Fuck.
- Fuck.

1100
01:24:43,971 --> 01:24:45,261
Come on, come on!

1101
01:24:54,210 --> 01:24:56,379
Keep going.
- Dad, I can't!

1102
01:25:09,048 --> 01:25:11,893
You stay the fuck away from my son!

1103
01:25:11,895 --> 01:25:13,063
Danny.
- Mom.

1104
01:25:15,356 --> 01:25:17,776
Burke, help me get him up.

1105
01:25:22,040 --> 01:25:24,280
Baby, baby, are you okay?

1106
01:25:24,282 --> 01:25:26,108
- Yes.
- Yeah?

1107
01:25:26,110 --> 01:25:28,118
We're gonna get you outta here. Okay?

1108
01:25:28,120 --> 01:25:30,825
- Yeah.
- Okay, okay we're gonna go.

1109
01:25:30,827 --> 01:25:32,996
Okay. Let's go, let's go.

1110
01:25:35,278 --> 01:25:38,907
Daniel, Daniel, come on. Let's go.

1111
01:25:38,909 --> 01:25:40,327
It's my fault.

1112
01:25:41,247 --> 01:25:42,247
What?

1113
01:25:43,138 --> 01:25:44,807
It's all my fault.

1114
01:25:46,008 --> 01:25:47,786
No, no, baby.

1115
01:25:47,788 --> 01:25:49,067
This is not your fault.

1116
01:25:49,069 --> 01:25:50,721
They're all dead because of me.

1117
01:25:52,550 --> 01:25:54,302
Honey, you didn't do this?

1118
01:25:54,304 --> 01:25:56,520
This is not your fault.
- Yes, I did!

1119
01:25:58,138 --> 01:26:00,539
If I hadn't have booked
that stupid fucking gig,

1120
01:26:00,541 --> 01:26:02,903
none of this shit would've happened!

1121
01:26:02,905 --> 01:26:04,156
It's not, no.

1122
01:26:05,816 --> 01:26:06,816
Baby, no.

1123
01:26:11,401 --> 01:26:13,348
You know how sometimes
people will look at you

1124
01:26:13,350 --> 01:26:15,664
and they'll say they know how you feel

1125
01:26:15,666 --> 01:26:16,850
when they really don't?

1126
01:26:19,740 --> 01:26:21,154
Dammit, Daniel, look at me!

1127
01:26:23,183 --> 01:26:24,988
I know how you feel.

1128
01:26:27,190 --> 01:26:28,190
I do. Okay?

1129
01:26:30,071 --> 01:26:31,356
Okay.

1130
01:26:31,358 --> 01:26:34,047
But right now you have
got to listen to me.

1131
01:26:34,915 --> 01:26:36,375
Your dad and Jenna are waiting.

1132
01:26:36,377 --> 01:26:39,406
We've gotta get the
hell out of this place.

1133
01:26:39,408 --> 01:26:41,065
Okay?
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

1134
01:26:41,067 --> 01:26:42,902
Okay? Okay, come on.

1135
01:26:52,888 --> 01:26:55,026
Stop hitting me!

1136
01:26:59,834 --> 01:27:01,002
No, get out!

1137
01:27:18,668 --> 01:27:21,243
Oh, dispatch?

1138
01:27:21,245 --> 01:27:23,953
I need to report a murder.

1139
01:27:30,288 --> 01:27:34,743
Whoo.

1140
01:27:36,866 --> 01:27:39,490
Good day to you, officer.

1141
01:27:54,751 --> 01:27:55,751
You fuck.

1142
01:27:59,296 --> 01:28:00,296
Oh, fuck.

1143
01:28:02,903 --> 01:28:03,903
Dammit.

1144
01:28:12,339 --> 01:28:13,339
Huh?

1145
01:28:16,268 --> 01:28:17,268
Fuck.

1146
01:28:20,292 --> 01:28:21,292
Ha-ha! Oh.

1147
01:28:25,449 --> 01:28:26,618
Where are you?

1148
01:28:31,830 --> 01:28:35,333
Where are you my little sweet, oh, oh, oh!

1149
01:28:43,935 --> 01:28:47,694
Oh, all this killing
people makes me so thirsty.

1150
01:28:49,279 --> 01:28:51,928
I'm just so parched.

1151
01:29:09,383 --> 01:29:10,977
Shit.

1152
01:29:10,979 --> 01:29:11,979
Daniel.

1153
01:29:12,713 --> 01:29:13,964
Daniel! Daniel!

1154
01:29:21,495 --> 01:29:23,605
Get off of me!

1155
01:29:23,607 --> 01:29:24,775
Get off him.

1156
01:29:28,575 --> 01:29:30,705
Nice little brother, huh!

1157
01:29:30,707 --> 01:29:32,798
Daniel! Daniel!

1158
01:30:42,538 --> 01:30:43,538
Myles!

1159
01:31:15,242 --> 01:31:16,994
'Tis a flesh wound.

1160
01:31:19,550 --> 01:31:20,550
No.

1161
01:31:52,478 --> 01:31:55,148
I know what it's like someone.

1162
01:32:41,095 --> 01:32:42,847
What is this place?

1163
01:32:44,901 --> 01:32:45,901
Home.

1164
01:32:48,264 --> 01:32:50,600
This is where you grew up?

1165
01:32:53,520 --> 01:32:54,372
Yeah.

1166
01:32:54,374 --> 01:32:55,789
We don't have much time.

1167
01:33:02,182 --> 01:33:03,350
Come on, babe.

1168
01:33:04,990 --> 01:33:07,863
I got ya, I got ya.
- Thanks, daddy.

1169
01:33:13,714 --> 01:33:14,714
Alex.

1170
01:34:04,935 --> 01:34:06,086
What are we gonna do?

1171
01:34:07,417 --> 01:34:08,907
We're gonna set a trap.

1172
01:34:08,909 --> 01:34:10,298
A trap?

1173
01:34:10,300 --> 01:34:12,622
Find something you can use as a weapon.

1174
01:34:24,982 --> 01:34:26,734
- No.
- What's wrong?

1175
01:34:31,613 --> 01:34:34,448
Just a lot of bad memories here.

1176
01:34:36,153 --> 01:34:39,156
Well, they weren't all bad, right?

1177
01:34:43,195 --> 01:34:45,979
No, no, baby, they weren't all bad.

1178
01:34:55,183 --> 01:34:56,183
Found it.

1179
01:35:07,205 --> 01:35:09,227
We got one shot at this,

1180
01:35:09,229 --> 01:35:10,925
so let's make a count.

1181
01:35:35,835 --> 01:35:37,003
He's coming.

1182
01:35:47,848 --> 01:35:50,926
Uh!

1183
01:35:55,710 --> 01:35:58,379
Come and get me, motherfucker.

1184
01:36:05,444 --> 01:36:06,529
No, no, no!

1185
01:36:11,933 --> 01:36:13,432
No!

1186
01:36:20,674 --> 01:36:21,674
Colin.

1187
01:36:32,011 --> 01:36:33,657
Colin!

1188
01:36:48,627 --> 01:36:50,013
Mom!

1189
01:36:52,768 --> 01:36:54,116
Mom.

1190
01:36:54,118 --> 01:36:55,343
Dad!

1191
01:36:55,345 --> 01:36:56,381
Dad!

1192
01:36:56,383 --> 01:36:57,802
Get off of him!

1193
01:36:59,059 --> 01:37:00,644
- Get up!
- Get up!

1194
01:37:04,942 --> 01:37:06,107
Hit him!

1195
01:37:08,186 --> 01:37:10,649
Dad, Dad, Dad, get up, get up.

1196
01:37:45,795 --> 01:37:46,795
Come on!

1197
01:38:33,992 --> 01:38:35,076
Fuck.

1198
01:38:49,019 --> 01:38:50,019
Alex.

1199
01:39:08,874 --> 01:39:11,544
How does it feel to be scared?

1200
01:39:13,453 --> 01:39:15,155
How does it feel to be threatened?

1201
01:39:17,481 --> 01:39:20,360
To no longer have control?

1202
01:39:24,344 --> 01:39:25,726
I never had control.

1203
01:39:41,301 --> 01:39:42,301
Die! Die!

1204
01:40:33,718 --> 01:40:35,519
Okay. It's all right.

1205
01:40:35,521 --> 01:40:36,732
Let's go.
