1
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:24,000
- Um, hi.

2
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,893
Just a second, just a second.

3
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:30,900
Lily, Lily, we are not
banging things right now.

4
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,483
Put it down, Lily, put it down.

5
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,850
Hi.

6
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:37,340
I'm sorry.

7
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:39,180
My daughter found a hammer.

8
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:41,780
Now where the fuck she found
a hammer, I do not know,

9
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:43,943
but that's where we are.

10
00:00:43,943 --> 00:00:45,763
- It's okay, I understand.

11
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:50,420
- If you're trying to sell
me solar panels right now,

12
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:51,823
I'm going to shoot you in the face.

13
00:00:51,823 --> 00:00:52,820
- Wow.

14
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,665
No, I'm Eli.

15
00:00:54,665 --> 00:00:56,410
I work for the Regional
Center of Orange County.

16
00:00:56,410 --> 00:00:57,453
We received a call.

17
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:02,533
- You came, you finally came.

18
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:06,104
You know, I've called 10,000 agencies

19
00:01:06,104 --> 00:01:08,490
and no one's been listening to me.

20
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:09,450
As you can see,

21
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:11,780
I'm kind of in an out of
control situation here

22
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:12,943
with my young daughter.

23
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:17,352
To be perfectly honest.

24
00:01:17,352 --> 00:01:18,530
I want to kiss you right now.

25
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:21,187
- That won't be necessary.

26
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:25,300
- I didn't think anyone was going to come.

27
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:28,300
Can I at least uh, give you a hug?

28
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:29,133
- Well.

29
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:31,833
Okay.

30
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:34,043
Okay.

31
00:01:34,043 --> 00:01:35,256
- Thank you.

32
00:01:35,256 --> 00:01:36,860
Thank you.

33
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:38,920
Oh gosh, look at me, I'm a mess.

34
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,293
Oh, come in, come in.

35
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:46,503
Uh be careful, she
sometimes throws things.

36
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:48,930
Watch your step.

37
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:06,763
- Hey Maddie um,

38
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:11,413
look, I'm sorry about everything.

39
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:19,763
I think I left some shirts
and extra stuff at your place.

40
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,560
If you find any of my shit,

41
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,563
you can just uh, just mail it to my moms.

42
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:32,480
I uh, I think I'm going to
stay here a couple of days

43
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,223
if she uh, if she lets me.

44
00:03:39,432 --> 00:03:40,265
All right.

45
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:56,183
Mom!

46
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,173
Mom!

47
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:55,570
- Two hours yesterday.

48
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:57,363
I can't hold again today.

49
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:01,610
Please, I can give you my name.

50
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:03,784
My name is Claire Burrows.

51
00:06:03,784 --> 00:06:04,617
- Mom.

52
00:06:04,617 --> 00:06:06,430
- Oh Jesus Christ.

53
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:08,120
You scared me.

54
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,909
I'm on the phone with
the insurance company.

55
00:06:09,909 --> 00:06:10,959
- I don't have a key.

56
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:17,063
- Claire Burrows, B-U-R-R-O-W-S.

57
00:06:18,888 --> 00:06:20,163
I'm the mother to Lily.

58
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,603
I've called you a thousand times.

59
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:29,523
No, no, ma'am my daughter is autistic.

60
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,430
Look, my older son just
walked in the door,

61
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:33,563
I don't have all day.

62
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:37,430
No, I'm not going to give
you all the details again.

63
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:40,350
Play back all the messages,
you'll have all the details.

64
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:42,547
Oh, watch your step, Miles.

65
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,960
I have had a hundred
different doctors tell her,

66
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:49,793
a hundred.

67
00:06:49,793 --> 00:06:50,964
- Where's Lily?

68
00:06:50,964 --> 00:06:51,797
- I don't know.

69
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:57,030
I have had a hundred different doctors

70
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:58,963
tell me a hundred different things.

71
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:03,223
You want the list?

72
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:08,110
Oppositional defiant
disorder, conduct disorder,

73
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:10,770
intermittent explosive disorder.

74
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:14,070
Why don't you just tell me the
name of a god damn disorder

75
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:15,993
and she's probably got it?

76
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:23,113
No, she threw a glass at me this time.

77
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,503
The tantrums are becoming more severe.

78
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:28,793
Last week, you said

79
00:07:28,793 --> 00:07:31,610
that we needed some kind
of an evaluator out here

80
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:34,560
before we can get any kind of services.

81
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,473
Please, my little girl needs help.

82
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,323
Please send someone.

83
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:45,736
Ma'am, no, no, no, no, don't,
don't, don't hang up on me.

84
00:07:45,736 --> 00:07:46,856
No.

85
00:07:46,856 --> 00:07:48,120
Ma'am,

86
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:48,953
no.

87
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:56,680
- Hey, I um, I
got tied up with Maddie.

88
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:01,260
She's um, she's going out
of town a couple of days.

89
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:04,593
Um, I think I might need to
stay here for a little while.

90
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:18,703
- Hey,

91
00:08:20,376 --> 00:08:21,970
are you okay?

92
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:23,020
- Yeah, never better.

93
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:26,760
- You cut your hair.

94
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,903
- Oh, you don't like my look?

95
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:29,873
- Jar head.

96
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,093
- Exactly.

97
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:38,113
Where is everyone?

98
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:43,210
- Lily's birthday party was
supposed to be today at noon.

99
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:44,103
Nobody came.

100
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:46,860
- Nobody?

101
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:48,663
- Nope.

102
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:52,090
I started getting calls
at the last minute.

103
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:53,303
Moms canceling.

104
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:57,060
It triggered her, you know
how she gets on her birthdays.

105
00:08:58,770 --> 00:08:59,820
- What about grandma?

106
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,010
- Come on Miles,

107
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:04,093
grandma hasn't shown up in two years.

108
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:06,743
You know that.

109
00:09:30,549 --> 00:09:31,819
Lily Burrows!

110
00:09:31,819 --> 00:09:35,128
- You said we weren't coming!

111
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:42,502
- I'm gonna kill myself!

112
00:09:42,502 --> 00:09:43,910
- No!

113
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:45,174
- Hey, hey, deep breath.

114
00:09:45,174 --> 00:09:46,454
- No, Lily Burrows!

115
00:09:46,454 --> 00:09:48,694
- Mom, go in the kitchen.

116
00:09:55,183 --> 00:09:56,016
Lily!

117
00:09:56,016 --> 00:09:57,496
- It's always mom's fault!

118
00:09:57,496 --> 00:09:59,330
It's always her fault!

119
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:01,710
- Look at these decorations, okay?

120
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:03,570
Look at the decorations.

121
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:04,923
I want this on my birthday.

122
00:10:12,738 --> 00:10:13,571
Breathe.

123
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:43,893
- My animals are trained to attack,

124
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,363
but they like you so,

125
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:53,323
you're probably safe.

126
00:10:57,832 --> 00:10:59,013
Until you visit the San Diego zoo.

127
00:11:01,573 --> 00:11:02,790
- Is that the TV commercial?

128
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:05,813
- Yeah, it's her newest thing.

129
00:11:11,107 --> 00:11:15,920
- The Energizer Bunny keeps
going and going and going.

130
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,900
- They call it scripting.

131
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:20,223
She actually memorizes the commercials.

132
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:24,343
- Hey Lils,

133
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:26,613
Lily,

134
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:28,643
you calm now?

135
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:35,963
- Nobody came to my birthday,

136
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:42,200
but they're lucky 'cause my
animals will kill them all.

137
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,920
- Lily, Lily, we are not
talking about killing.

138
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:47,773
- Hey, hey, what am I, invisible?

139
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,310
I came to your party.

140
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,030
- Did you get me a present?

141
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:57,853
- No.

142
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:02,190
- Good, 'cause I hate presents,

143
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:04,093
'cause you have to say thank you.

144
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:07,813
People smile at you and say thank you.

145
00:12:08,821 --> 00:12:12,488
- I got you something
better than a present.

146
00:12:15,749 --> 00:12:17,203
- I was only kidding.

147
00:12:20,067 --> 00:12:22,234
- This is a magic unicorn.

148
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:28,050
Okay, she is much better
than the Energizer Bunny.

149
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:31,403
She will be the greatest
friend you ever have.

150
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:37,540
Hey, can I get a picture of you guys?

151
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:38,373
- Okay.

152
00:12:39,684 --> 00:12:41,330
Did you hear that?

153
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:44,275
He's gonna take a picture of us.

154
00:12:44,275 --> 00:12:45,108
Cheese.

155
00:12:47,557 --> 00:12:49,297
- Hey, hey!

156
00:12:55,828 --> 00:12:56,661
Lily.

157
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:59,943
She's been taking my phone now too.

158
00:13:02,485 --> 00:13:06,798
- 105, 55, 35, the most important call

159
00:13:06,798 --> 00:13:08,215
you'll ever make.

160
00:13:13,487 --> 00:13:15,173
How is she magic?

161
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:21,550
- Um, well she um, she
protects whoever's holding her.

162
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:25,093
- Can she sleep in my bed?

163
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:30,103
- Of course, that's what she does best.

164
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:36,770
- Hey Lily, I want to see her.

165
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:41,090
- No, no, she doesn't like moms.

166
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:43,140
You don't like moms, right?

167
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:46,240
- Well then I think the
unicorn might get put away

168
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,453
until you can learn to be a little nicer.

169
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:54,290
Lily, no, put that down now.

170
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:56,480
- I could stick this in your eye!

171
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,565
- I'm so tired of this.

172
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:04,820
- Hey, Lily, Lily, a fork,
a fork is a great idea,

173
00:14:06,916 --> 00:14:08,300
okay?

174
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:12,563
If you didn't have a fork,
how would we eat this cake?

175
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,203
So as soon as you apologize to mom,

176
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,063
you could have some cake.

177
00:14:45,748 --> 00:14:47,081
- I'm sorry mom.

178
00:14:55,213 --> 00:14:56,213
- It's okay.

179
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:03,650
Do you want some cake?

180
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:15,203
- I want it.

181
00:15:18,798 --> 00:15:19,631
- Hm.

182
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:23,590
- Mom.

183
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,140
- Yeah?

184
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:26,423
- I love the balloons.

185
00:15:27,829 --> 00:15:32,110
You got green because that's
my favorite color, right?

186
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:33,583
- I sure did, Lils.

187
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:36,910
- You want some cake?

188
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,233
What's that?

189
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:44,253
- It's Visine.

190
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,940
- Visine gets the red out.

191
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:48,597
- Yes it does.

192
00:15:48,597 --> 00:15:50,347
- Are we going to have a sleepover?

193
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:56,230
- I think we're going to
have a couple of sleepovers.

194
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:58,083
- Can you make me pancakes?

195
00:15:59,173 --> 00:16:01,760
- When are you gonna make me pancakes?

196
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,623
- I'm not allowed to use the stove.

197
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:07,390
- You got a point.

198
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:08,393
- Yeah, duh.

199
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:17,070
- So Lily, what's it like to be 11?

200
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:18,840
- How am I supposed to know?

201
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,573
I just had my birthday.

202
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:26,963
Why didn't anyone come?

203
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:34,773
- People, people get too busy.

204
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,250
- Is it because of me?

205
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:38,950
- No, no.

206
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:40,993
It's because people are assholes.

207
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:49,140
- Miles, what's, what's wrong with me?

208
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:52,130
- Hey, don't say that, okay?

209
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:53,723
Nothing is wrong with you.

210
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:58,063
Sometimes,

211
00:16:58,063 --> 00:17:00,483
you just see the world
differently than other people do.

212
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:03,033
- People like mom.

213
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,840
- You know mom loves you, right?

214
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:10,730
When you see her on
the phone all the time,

215
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:12,830
she's working really hard to get you help.

216
00:17:13,685 --> 00:17:15,610
- I don't need help.

217
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:17,270
- I say the same thing, okay?

218
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:19,350
But you know what the truth is?

219
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:22,661
Everybody needs help, we
all need help sometimes.

220
00:17:22,661 --> 00:17:24,230
- Like even you?

221
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:25,163
- Especially me.

222
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:31,113
See, you can change,
but you have to want to.

223
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:35,873
- My brain tells me that mom hates me.

224
00:17:37,137 --> 00:17:39,010
- You know how I know mom loves you?

225
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:40,420
- You're going to tell me a story.

226
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:41,790
Does it have a dragon?

227
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:44,440
- Because she spends all
her time thinking about you.

228
00:17:46,757 --> 00:17:49,660
- I wish she didn't think about me.

229
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:52,820
- Then you got to stop
doing all this stuff you do.

230
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:54,870
- My brain tells me to do that stuff.

231
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:57,330
- Okay, then you've got to
tell your brain to stop.

232
00:17:57,330 --> 00:17:59,273
- Then what do you tell your brain?

233
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:10,113
- I don't, I don't talk
to my brain enough.

234
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,730
Hey, tonight, let's um,

235
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:22,730
let's get some popcorn and rent a movie.

236
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:26,760
- Okay, well I get to pick

237
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,940
because you always pick crap movies.

238
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:30,483
- Okay, no I don't.

239
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:32,374
- Yes you do.

240
00:18:32,374 --> 00:18:33,207
- No.

241
00:18:33,207 --> 00:18:34,040
- Yeah.

242
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,060
- I pick great movies.

243
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:37,283
- I want something with a dragon.

244
00:18:39,847 --> 00:18:41,853
- You are so beautiful, Lily.

245
00:20:22,757 --> 00:20:26,085
- Miles, wake up,
wake up, wake up, wake up!

246
00:20:26,085 --> 00:20:27,283
- What the fuck?

247
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:30,177
- What the fuck?

248
00:20:30,177 --> 00:20:32,483
- You can't just jump on people like that.

249
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:34,673
- What the fuck?

250
00:20:34,673 --> 00:20:35,733
What the fuck?

251
00:20:35,733 --> 00:20:36,773
What the fuck?

252
00:20:36,773 --> 00:20:38,549
What the fuck?

253
00:20:38,549 --> 00:20:40,053
What the fuck?

254
00:20:40,053 --> 00:20:41,045
What the fuck?

255
00:20:41,045 --> 00:20:42,840
What the fuck?

256
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:45,621
- Hey, hey, Lily, do you
want broccoli for lunch?

257
00:20:45,621 --> 00:20:46,920
- Fuck no.

258
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:49,610
- Hey if I hear
that word one more time.

259
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:52,160
I'm going to give you
broccoli sandwiches all week.

260
00:20:54,506 --> 00:20:57,761
- Look, just grab your lunch
and get to the bus, please.

261
00:20:57,761 --> 00:20:59,511
- Bye Miles, bye mom.

262
00:21:10,468 --> 00:21:11,301
- Thanks.

263
00:21:17,957 --> 00:21:20,757
- I'm not sure what
you have planned for today.

264
00:21:22,882 --> 00:21:24,390
- I'm going to turn in my exams

265
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:26,093
all day.

266
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,933
- Very funny Miles.

267
00:21:31,044 --> 00:21:32,123
I've got an idea.

268
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:34,590
Why don't we go to the pond?

269
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:37,793
- Right now?

270
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:41,643
Uh,

271
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:44,603
okay.

272
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,980
- When was the last time we were here?

273
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:15,870
- Well, Lilly's 11, so 11 years.

274
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:20,920
- I used to bring you here every Saturday.

275
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:25,080
You were so excited about the ducks.

276
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,430
I swear, I thought you were going to go in

277
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:27,773
right after them, Miles.

278
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:32,930
- Yeah I uh, I remember
one time I got so excited,

279
00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:34,513
I rolled my pants up and I.

280
00:22:34,513 --> 00:22:35,840
- Look I'm, I'm sorry,

281
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,900
but I got to work tonight
and I just need to know,

282
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,850
are you going to be okay watching Lily?

283
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,020
- Where are you trying to go with this?

284
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:50,400
- Miles, I haven't
seen you since rehab.

285
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,393
What has it been, two, three months?

286
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,430
- This is the only talk we have.

287
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:57,830
- And I need to know if
you're going to be okay.

288
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:01,523
- I'm fine.

289
00:23:04,005 --> 00:23:04,838
I'm fine.

290
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:09,743
- You know, you are so, so good with her.

291
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:13,043
She would break most everyone.

292
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:16,173
Look at me for Christ's sake.

293
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:20,370
She listens to everything you say.

294
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:21,563
- Even when I say fuck.

295
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:26,000
- That was funny.

296
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:33,173
- Mom, can I ask you something?

297
00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:35,980
- I'm sorry,

298
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,920
I know you and I have had
our share of problems,

299
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:44,333
but Miles, I need you now more than ever.

300
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:46,990
Lily needs you

301
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,080
and I'm going to trust you one more time,

302
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,283
so don't fuck this up.

303
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:54,730
- It's only one night.

304
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:02,380
Last night you were singing to Lily.

305
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:04,773
I, I recognize that song.

306
00:24:07,778 --> 00:24:08,611
- Yeah,

307
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:12,453
I used to sing it to you every night.

308
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:15,463
You were always my melancholy baby.

309
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:18,710
You were so sensitive.

310
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:21,763
- Yeah well, I guess
some things never change.

311
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,193
- How is Maddie?

312
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:34,603
- She's, she's good.

313
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:43,690
Hey so um, if I'm watching Lily tonight,

314
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:47,600
I was thinking about getting
her pizza or something.

315
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:51,223
- Oh, well that sounds
like a pretty good idea.

316
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:55,750
- I could get her to
some wings and soda and stuff.

317
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:58,250
- Are you asking
me for money right now?

318
00:24:58,250 --> 00:25:00,310
- Do you want me to rob the place?

319
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:03,060
- Do you really think that I
should give you money, Miles?

320
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:05,930
- Mom, this is
Lily we're talking about.

321
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:08,593
All I need is 20 bucks.

322
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:19,763
Lily, let's go, dinner!

323
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:24,950
- What's my surprise?

324
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:29,103
- Your favorite, peanut butter and jelly.

325
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:37,760
- That's, that's not a surprise.

326
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,340
- Okay, well
here's the surprise part.

327
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:41,870
No parent would ever allow their kid

328
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:44,680
to have PB and J for dinner.

329
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,680
It's almost illegal.

330
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:52,360
- Fine, but can we sit on the
floor and have a picnic then?

331
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,433
- You read my mind.

332
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:57,183
Why don't we take this
into the other room,

333
00:25:58,610 --> 00:26:00,940
go get the red blanket,
spread it out on the floor

334
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:03,513
and I'll be there in a
couple seconds, okay?

335
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:05,963
- Okay Miles.

336
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:21,763
- Hey Maddie.

337
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:26,513
Yeah, yeah now's a good time.

338
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:32,117
I know we could work this out.

339
00:26:32,117 --> 00:26:34,323
- Miles, where's the red blanket?

340
00:26:36,090 --> 00:26:37,550
- Maddie, just a sec.

341
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:39,600
Lily, I need a few minutes here, okay?

342
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,963
Just check behind the couch.

343
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:48,373
Look, I know I've done some stupid things.

344
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:52,180
- It's not behind the couch.

345
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:53,557
- Can you try the closet?

346
00:26:53,557 --> 00:26:55,190
- It's not in the closet.

347
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:58,433
- Lily, a few minutes here, please.

348
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:01,410
I mean, all I had was a couple of drinks.

349
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:03,310
I mean, I don't see why you
lost your mind over this.

350
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:05,205
- I can't find it, I can't find it,

351
00:27:05,205 --> 00:27:06,325
I can't find my blanket.

352
00:27:06,325 --> 00:27:07,493
Miles, how are we
supposed to have a picnic

353
00:27:07,493 --> 00:27:08,501
without a red blanket?

354
00:27:08,501 --> 00:27:10,839
I need my red blanket, I need
to find it, I need to find it!

355
00:27:10,839 --> 00:27:11,913
- No Maddie.

356
00:27:11,913 --> 00:27:14,750
Maddie, I do want to talk to you, okay?

357
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:16,483
She's just going crazy here.

358
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:20,060
Maddie, you have to
understand my situation.

359
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:21,283
Okay, please?

360
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,353
Maddie.

361
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:25,043
Maddie.

362
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:26,933
Fuck!

363
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,990
- Why are you so mad at me?

364
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:37,573
- I'm not mad at you.

365
00:29:21,829 --> 00:29:24,680
- This one is a triceratops.

366
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:27,690
Her name is rainbow
because she likes rainbows,

367
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:29,029
but the problem is

368
00:29:29,029 --> 00:29:31,920
that many of the other
dinosaurs like this one,

369
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:35,010
like rainbows, because then it has to rain

370
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:37,390
and then the ground gets all muddy

371
00:29:37,390 --> 00:29:40,340
and everybody knows
dinosaurs hate the mud.

372
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:44,110
Ugh, I hate the mud, so they
try to kill the rainbow.

373
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:46,920
Ugh, I killed you rainbow.

374
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:51,525
She wants to stay alive,
she has to kill them first.

375
00:29:51,525 --> 00:29:54,245
Roar, roar, I'm gonna kill you!

376
00:29:54,245 --> 00:29:57,300
No you aren't, I'm gonna
kill you first, roar!

377
00:29:57,300 --> 00:30:01,337
Fine, well I'll get my other
dinosaurs to help me kill you.

378
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:06,510
- I got to go to the bathroom.

379
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,629
- Okay guys, let's kill!

380
00:30:16,629 --> 00:30:17,462
Roar!

381
00:30:18,485 --> 00:30:19,318
Roar!

382
00:30:21,147 --> 00:30:23,983
Ha ha, you guys didn't even hurt me,

383
00:30:23,983 --> 00:30:26,643
because I'm so strong, because I'm a tri.

384
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:38,633
Miles.

385
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:41,813
I heard a noise.

386
00:31:05,013 --> 00:31:07,180
Miles, what are you doing?

387
00:31:21,809 --> 00:31:24,600
Miles, you're making a mess everywhere.

388
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,150
You're going to get in trouble.

389
00:31:57,134 --> 00:31:58,134
Here you go.

390
00:33:25,547 --> 00:33:26,547
- Oh my God.

391
00:33:28,946 --> 00:33:30,597
Lils!

392
00:33:30,597 --> 00:33:32,706
Ah, fuck man.

393
00:33:32,706 --> 00:33:35,552
Lily!

394
00:33:35,552 --> 00:33:36,385
Lily!

395
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:52,373
Hey, Lils.

396
00:33:54,610 --> 00:33:55,443
Lily.

397
00:33:56,818 --> 00:33:59,711
Lils.

398
00:33:59,711 --> 00:34:02,639
Lily.

399
00:34:02,639 --> 00:34:03,472
Lils.

400
00:34:05,202 --> 00:34:06,035
Lily.

401
00:34:07,010 --> 00:34:07,843
Lils.

402
00:34:38,562 --> 00:34:39,645
I'm so sorry.

403
00:35:34,248 --> 00:35:35,581
- Hey, hey, hey.

404
00:35:38,434 --> 00:35:41,267
You gotta tell me the truth, okay?

405
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,620
Did you take any of the pills?

406
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:46,663
- No.

407
00:35:47,509 --> 00:35:50,192
I was gonna feed them to my animals,

408
00:35:50,192 --> 00:35:53,042
but then I was worried
they were gonna throw up

409
00:35:53,042 --> 00:35:55,292
and make a mess everywhere.

410
00:35:56,493 --> 00:35:57,326
- Okay.

411
00:35:58,254 --> 00:35:59,087
Okay.

412
00:36:02,343 --> 00:36:03,553
Okay.

413
00:36:03,553 --> 00:36:04,803
Where are they?

414
00:36:06,991 --> 00:36:09,933
- I put them in your room.

415
00:36:09,933 --> 00:36:11,808
Am I in trouble for going in your room?

416
00:36:11,808 --> 00:36:15,009
- No, no, no.

417
00:36:15,009 --> 00:36:17,380
No, you're not in trouble.

418
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,220
Can you make me a promise?

419
00:36:37,690 --> 00:36:41,373
I won't tell mom that you
fell asleep in the closet,

420
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:46,119
if uh,

421
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:50,603
if you don't tell her I fell
asleep in the bathroom, okay?

422
00:36:52,673 --> 00:36:53,506
Okay.

423
00:36:54,722 --> 00:36:56,363
- Can we have movie night?

424
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:06,500
- Anytime you want.

425
00:37:09,762 --> 00:37:11,167
- Can you carry me to bed?

426
00:37:14,450 --> 00:37:15,283
- Yeah.

427
00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:17,940
Yeah, come here kiddo.

428
00:38:08,245 --> 00:38:09,078
- Roar!

429
00:38:09,078 --> 00:38:10,513
- So why don't you like elephants?

430
00:38:10,513 --> 00:38:13,150
- Because triceratops
are so much better

431
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:14,386
'cause they have horns

432
00:38:14,386 --> 00:38:15,694
and they could beat all the things up.

433
00:38:15,694 --> 00:38:16,527
Roar!

434
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:20,190
No, that's not fair.

435
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:22,890
- You two look like
you're having a good time.

436
00:38:22,890 --> 00:38:26,060
- Yeah, we had a great night.

437
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:26,893
- Oh yeah?

438
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:28,963
- Right Miles?

439
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:40,020
- Miles honey, why don't
you go up and get some rest?

440
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:40,967
I can watch her.

441
00:38:42,386 --> 00:38:43,219
- All right.

442
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:47,173
Hey Lils,

443
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:51,280
thanks for being so good last night.

444
00:38:56,670 --> 00:39:01,670
Also, an elephant could
definitely beat up a triceratops.

445
00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:04,010
- No they can't.

446
00:39:04,010 --> 00:39:06,583
He doesn't know what he's
talking about, triceratops.

447
00:39:09,848 --> 00:39:12,389
- Hey.

448
00:39:12,389 --> 00:39:17,389
I missed you.

449
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:28,433
Lily, no!

450
00:39:38,562 --> 00:39:40,070
Um, hi.

451
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:40,903
Just a second.

452
00:39:41,828 --> 00:39:42,683
Be careful.

453
00:39:49,910 --> 00:39:53,840
So, what do you want to know?

454
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:58,573
As you can see, our lives
around here are pretty chaotic.

455
00:40:00,090 --> 00:40:01,750
This is Lily.

456
00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:03,970
She is 11 years old.

457
00:40:03,970 --> 00:40:06,313
She struggles with impulse control.

458
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:10,553
- Uh, there must be some mistake.

459
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:14,710
- No, no, no, no, there's no mistake.

460
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:16,220
This is Lily.

461
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:18,580
I'm Claire, Claire Burrows.

462
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:21,670
Sir, I've called you
about a thousand times.

463
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:23,540
I am not letting you walk out of here

464
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:24,913
until she gets some help.

465
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:31,190
- No, I have a referral, but
it's for a Miles Burrows.

466
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:36,580
- Wait, what's going on?

467
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:37,413
- Miles?

468
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,700
I'm from the Regional
Center of Orange County.

469
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:44,913
We contract with several recovery clinics.

470
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,700
- No, no, I, I
completed my program.

471
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:51,360
- I understand that,

472
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:54,403
but in cases of benzodiazepine addiction,

473
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:57,423
occurrences of relapses are pretty high.

474
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:04,290
- Did you call them on me?

475
00:41:04,290 --> 00:41:05,340
- Miles, no.

476
00:41:06,194 --> 00:41:07,670
No.

477
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:09,030
No Miles, I swear.

478
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:10,430
- Nobody's to blame here.

479
00:41:10,430 --> 00:41:11,410
- Shut the fuck up.

480
00:41:11,410 --> 00:41:13,903
- Not in front of Lily, Miles!

481
00:41:13,903 --> 00:41:15,833
- Wait, wait, hold on.

482
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:20,594
- You didn't even let me get
through two fucking days.

483
00:41:20,594 --> 00:41:23,850
- Miles, Miles, I swear
to God I didn't call.

484
00:41:23,850 --> 00:41:26,640
- How do you expect
me not to be an addict?

485
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:27,953
I grew up here!

486
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:34,973
You stopped caring about me 11 years ago!

487
00:41:36,050 --> 00:41:38,143
You don't give a fuck about me!

488
00:41:39,746 --> 00:41:43,586
- 105, 55, 35, the most
important call you'll ever make.

489
00:41:43,586 --> 00:41:47,856
105, 55, 35, the most important
call you'll ever make!

490
00:41:47,856 --> 00:41:48,962
- Fuck's sake.

491
00:41:48,962 --> 00:41:52,882
- 105, 55, the most important
call you'll ever make!

492
00:42:13,858 --> 00:42:16,441
- Ma'am, that's our commercial.

493
00:42:26,577 --> 00:42:28,077
- Am I in trouble?

494
00:42:29,830 --> 00:42:33,540
- Uh, we got a call
at30 in the morning.

495
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:35,800
Sources said it was from his number,

496
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:38,500
that's a red flag for us,
we came as soon as we could.

497
00:42:42,070 --> 00:42:42,903
- Lily,

498
00:42:45,430 --> 00:42:47,630
did you call someone
on my phone last night?

499
00:42:55,570 --> 00:43:00,003
- Sometimes, we have
to let other people help.

500
00:43:03,550 --> 00:43:04,383
- Miles.

501
00:43:05,762 --> 00:43:07,163
Are you using again?

502
00:43:09,234 --> 00:43:10,067
Miles.

503
00:43:14,148 --> 00:43:17,824
- I need my big brother back.

504
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,033
- We have,

505
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:27,933
we have openings in our
program right now, Miles.

506
00:43:29,310 --> 00:43:31,310
You fill out those forms,

507
00:43:31,310 --> 00:43:34,020
we can get you started within the week.

508
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:36,470
- I'm going to be there
for you this time, Miles.

509
00:43:38,271 --> 00:43:41,521
- Okay, I'm really, really good friends

510
00:43:42,450 --> 00:43:45,370
with the director of the
Children's Mental Help Office.

511
00:43:45,370 --> 00:43:47,458
If you want, I can call him right now

512
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:49,102
and we can tell them about Lily.

513
00:43:49,102 --> 00:43:51,435
- Yeah, I'd appreciate that.
