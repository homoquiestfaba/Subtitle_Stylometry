1
00:00:24,958 --> 00:00:26,687
Trick or treat.

2
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,094
Well, look at this.

3
00:00:29,162 --> 00:00:32,154
All the superheroes on our porch.
Ain't that cute?

4
00:00:32,932 --> 00:00:37,062
We got Superman here, and Batman...

5
00:00:37,737 --> 00:00:39,671
and his sidekick Robin.

6
00:00:40,273 --> 00:00:43,538
The Green Lantern.
And what about you, young man?

7
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:48,203
- What about what?
- Who are you supposed to be?

8
00:00:48,782 --> 00:00:51,683
- I'm Harvey Pekar.
- Pecker.

9
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:55,847
Harvey Pekar?
That doesn't sound like a superhero to me.

10
00:00:59,459 --> 00:01:00,983
I ain't no superhero, lady.

11
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:04,189
I'm just a kid
from the neighborhood, all right?

12
00:01:05,865 --> 00:01:07,298
Forget this!

13
00:01:15,775 --> 00:01:18,505
Why does everybody have to be so stupid?

14
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:39,886
Okay, this guy here, he's our man.

15
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:42,320
Okay, this guy here, he's our man.

16
00:03:42,755 --> 00:03:45,087
All grown up and going nowhere.

17
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:50,555
Always a pretty scholarly cat.
He never got much of a formal education.

18
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:55,299
For the most part, he's lived
in shit neighborhoods, held shit jobs...

19
00:03:55,535 --> 00:03:59,027
and is now knee-deep
into a disastrous second marriage.

20
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:02,470
So if you're the kind of person
looking for romance or escapism...

21
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:05,636
or some fantasy figure to save the day,
guess what?

22
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:09,009
- You got the wrong movie.
- That's great.

23
00:04:09,482 --> 00:04:13,714
So now you got four takes. You ought
to be able to patch one together from there.

24
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,356
Right? Let's go to the next one, all right?

25
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:20,085
Hold on a second.
Do you want some water or something?

26
00:04:20,159 --> 00:04:23,151
- No, I got lots of orange.
- Do you like orange soda?

27
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:24,958
Yeah, orange is all right.

28
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:27,864
All right, let's go to the next sequence.

29
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:30,334
Did you actually read the script?

30
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:32,329
No. A little bit.

31
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,440
Just to check the construction.

32
00:04:37,377 --> 00:04:40,107
You know, how the piece was constructed.

33
00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:42,247
I didn't read it word for word.

34
00:04:42,315 --> 00:04:44,078
Do you feel weird saying this stuff?

35
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:46,584
No, I don't feel weird saying it.

36
00:04:46,819 --> 00:04:49,652
I don't know how long
my voice is going to hold out.

37
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:51,681
Doc, you gotta help me, man.

38
00:04:53,092 --> 00:04:55,720
My old lady's dumping me
'cause I can't talk.

39
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:59,822
She says I'm a social embarrassment.

40
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:05,466
Now that she's got a PhD,
she's some hot-shit academic star...

41
00:05:05,705 --> 00:05:08,003
and I'm nothing but a file clerk.

42
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:12,644
Me being a file clerk was fine when I was
signing the damn checks for tuition.

43
00:05:12,712 --> 00:05:15,840
Harvey, stop talking, please, and open wide.

44
00:05:15,915 --> 00:05:18,475
I started worrying
my voice would never come back.

45
00:05:18,551 --> 00:05:20,246
Say "Aah," Mr. Pekar.

46
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,584
It's torture, I'm telling you.

47
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:35,062
What? Is it bad, Doc?

48
00:05:35,134 --> 00:05:36,465
It's not good.

49
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:39,369
It's cancer.

50
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:43,439
First I got marital problems, and now
you're telling me I got throat cancer.

51
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:48,344
- For Christ's sake, man.
- Harvey, calm down, it's not cancer.

52
00:05:49,115 --> 00:05:53,074
You have a nodule on your vocal cords,
probably from screaming and yelling.

53
00:05:53,152 --> 00:05:56,610
If you don't give it a rest,
you're gonna lose your voice completely.

54
00:05:56,689 --> 00:06:00,022
Okay. But for how long?

55
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:03,725
- A few months.
- Months?

56
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:51,910
- Hey, come on, what is this?
- Exactly what it looks like.

57
00:06:53,513 --> 00:06:56,744
What do you mean?
You mean you're dumping me? For what?

58
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:05,823
This plebeian lifestyle...

59
00:07:05,892 --> 00:07:08,725
just isn't working for me anymore, okay?

60
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:13,059
I gotta get out of here before I kill myself.

61
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,570
Just listen to what I have to say, okay?

62
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:33,474
Don't go.

63
00:07:35,521 --> 00:07:37,045
I need you, baby.

64
00:07:38,057 --> 00:07:39,991
Please don't go, okay?

65
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:02,772
Here's our man.

66
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:05,375
Yeah, all right, here's me.

67
00:08:05,785 --> 00:08:09,448
Or the guy playing me anyway,
though he don't look nothing like me.

68
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:11,080
But whatever.

69
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:16,259
So it's a few months later, and I'm working
my flunky file clerk gig at the VA hospital.

70
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,727
My voice still ain't back yet.

71
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:22,030
Thank you, Harvey, dear.

72
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:24,934
Things seem like they can't get any worse.

73
00:08:25,304 --> 00:08:26,601
"Plebeian"?

74
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:31,107
Where the hell did she get that shit, man?

75
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:43,755
"Avoid the reeking herd

76
00:08:45,424 --> 00:08:47,324
"Shun the polluted flock

77
00:08:47,393 --> 00:08:49,486
"Live like that stoic bird

78
00:08:49,996 --> 00:08:51,623
"The eagle of the rock"

79
00:08:51,731 --> 00:08:55,258
- Hey, Mr. Boats.
- You know what that means, son?

80
00:08:56,435 --> 00:09:00,132
Yeah, it's from an Elinor Hoyt Wylie poem.

81
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,599
It means... Excuse me.

82
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:07,435
It means stay away from the crowds
of common, ordinary people...

83
00:09:07,513 --> 00:09:10,505
- and do your own thing.
- No.

84
00:09:11,984 --> 00:09:16,080
It means don't compromise yourself
for women. It ain't gonna do you no good.

85
00:09:16,155 --> 00:09:18,715
Get away from them as soon as you can.

86
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:21,449
I ain't got no woman now.

87
00:09:22,361 --> 00:09:26,661
- I'm living like the stoic bird, man.
- It's the only way to live, son.

88
00:09:30,469 --> 00:09:32,266
Look at that fool there.

89
00:09:32,338 --> 00:09:36,775
Probably listening to that loud rock stuff.
Junk, it's all junk.

90
00:09:37,677 --> 00:09:39,702
I don't know. I mean...

91
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:42,441
rock music's got some good qualities.

92
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:46,047
It isn't jazz or nothing, but you know...

93
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:51,022
Say, when are you gonna bring me in
some of those good records?

94
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:55,459
- Some Nat King Cole with strings.
- I don't got any of that, Mr. Boats.

95
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:59,055
Yeah, you got that.
You're keeping them at home, though.

96
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:03,263
You won't turn loose the good stuff.
You just sell the junk.

97
00:10:08,074 --> 00:10:10,565
I keep the stuff I wanna keep.

98
00:10:11,844 --> 00:10:15,803
I sold a lot of good material
by people that he didn't like.

99
00:10:18,317 --> 00:10:21,753
Mr. Boats didn't like any blues
or anything like that.

100
00:10:23,522 --> 00:10:25,581
He played classical violin.

101
00:10:29,061 --> 00:10:33,225
I started record collecting
when I was 15 or 16 years old.

102
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:36,358
I started getting interested in jazz.

103
00:10:36,502 --> 00:10:39,130
Prior to that, I collected comic books.

104
00:10:39,405 --> 00:10:41,066
I was always a collector.

105
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:48,437
I admit to having
an obsessive-compulsive quality in me.

106
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:54,547
It's like The Treasure of the Sierra Madre
or something.

107
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:57,214
You go to thrift shops
and you go to the garage sales...

108
00:10:57,289 --> 00:11:01,157
because you think you're gonna find
something that's real rare.

109
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:05,760
And most of time, it's a total waste of time,
but once in a while...

110
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:09,733
you'll come up with something
that'll whet your appetite.

111
00:11:20,146 --> 00:11:21,272
In the early '60s...

112
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:24,783
I was with some buddies at a junk sale,
looking for some choice sides...

113
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:28,809
when I met this shy, retiring cat
from Philadelphia named Bob Crumb.

114
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:30,048
You know the guy.

115
00:11:30,122 --> 00:11:34,252
Fritz the Cat, Mr. Natural and all.
They made a movie about him, too.

116
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:38,591
Jay McShann.

117
00:11:44,236 --> 00:11:46,067
Come on, Harv, you gonna buy that,
or what?

118
00:11:46,138 --> 00:11:49,164
I don't know, Marty,
it's got a lamination crack.

119
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:50,901
A quarter.

120
00:11:52,678 --> 00:11:54,771
Maybe I could talk it down.

121
00:11:55,414 --> 00:11:58,474
- You are one cheap bastard, Harvey.
- I know I'm tight, man.

122
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:00,917
I live on a government wage.

123
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:04,685
You collect Jay McShann, man?

124
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:07,249
- Yeah, man, how about you?
- Yeah.

125
00:12:07,526 --> 00:12:10,222
But most of my records are back in Philly.

126
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:13,823
Harvey, meet my buddy, Bob Crumb.
He just moved to town.

127
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:16,766
He's an artist
with the American Greeting Card Company.

128
00:12:16,836 --> 00:12:19,862
You should see his comics, Harv.
They're out of sight.

129
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:23,941
I'm into comics myself.

130
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:37,982
So Crumb showed me this comic book novel
he was working on:

131
00:12:38,057 --> 00:12:39,581
Big Yum Yum Book.

132
00:12:39,658 --> 00:12:41,455
I'd never seen anything like it.

133
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:44,223
This is terrific. I really dig your work, man.

134
00:12:44,463 --> 00:12:48,695
This Peter Wheat book is by Walt Kelly.
It's pretty rare.

135
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:51,861
- Yeah? Can I get good bread for it?
- Not yet.

136
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:57,367
Let's get back to your book.
What are you gonna do with it?

137
00:12:57,443 --> 00:13:00,606
I haven't really thought about it.
It's just an exercise.

138
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:04,447
No, man. It's more than just an exercise.

139
00:13:05,584 --> 00:13:09,577
It's breaking ground, man.
There's some wild shit in here, Bob.

140
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:12,390
You're spitting on me, Harvey.

141
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,946
Crumb and I hung out a lot back then.

142
00:13:38,517 --> 00:13:40,883
We had records and comics in common.

143
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,457
Check it out, man.

144
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:52,463
Pretty scary.

145
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,991
You don't know the half of it, man.

146
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:00,630
Eventually, people got hip
to Crumb's artwork...

147
00:14:00,706 --> 00:14:04,005
and he started hanging out
with the bohemian crowd.

148
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:08,740
After a while, he got sick of greeting cards
and moved away to San Francisco...

149
00:14:08,814 --> 00:14:12,250
where he got the whole underground
comic scene off the ground.

150
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:19,350
He'd come back to Cleveland
every few years...

151
00:14:19,425 --> 00:14:22,326
and people would treat him like a celebrity.

152
00:14:33,772 --> 00:14:36,935
Once, he came to visit
when I was feeling real bad.

153
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:39,500
It was right after my wife left me.

154
00:14:39,678 --> 00:14:42,146
She got so mean to me at the end...

155
00:14:42,648 --> 00:14:46,015
like I tried to keep her captive
or anything like that.

156
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:49,611
I don't know, man.

157
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:53,716
But don't think
I'm buying any of this growth crap, man.

158
00:14:53,993 --> 00:14:57,451
Everybody's always talking about
how bad experiences cause you to grow...

159
00:14:57,529 --> 00:14:59,394
and all that cliched stuff.

160
00:14:59,965 --> 00:15:03,867
Man, I got enough bad experiences
and growth to last me plenty.

161
00:15:10,709 --> 00:15:12,108
Right now...

162
00:15:13,512 --> 00:15:16,413
I'd be glad to trade some growth
for happiness.

163
00:15:24,223 --> 00:15:26,589
How long you staying in Cleveland, man?

164
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:30,826
I don't know,
I got to see this chick in New York...

165
00:15:30,896 --> 00:15:33,660
and I'm really busy
with the comic book stuff.

166
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:37,664
It's good bread and all.
I'm just getting sick of the whole scene.

167
00:15:37,736 --> 00:15:39,499
What are you talking about?

168
00:15:39,571 --> 00:15:42,131
You make a good living
doing your art, right?

169
00:15:43,575 --> 00:15:46,100
How many guys get that lucky in their life?

170
00:15:47,646 --> 00:15:49,273
Listen, I'll tell you something.

171
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:51,908
People are starting
to know the name Crumb.

172
00:15:51,984 --> 00:15:54,976
When you croak, man,
you're gonna leave something behind.

173
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:56,578
Yeah, I guess.

174
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:00,982
It's not like I'm Blind Lemon Jefferson,
or Big Mama Thornton.

175
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,755
Come on, man.

176
00:16:02,828 --> 00:16:05,695
I tell you something,
it sure beats working a gig like mine...

177
00:16:05,764 --> 00:16:09,598
being a nobody flunky
and selling records on the side for $1.

178
00:16:11,737 --> 00:16:13,398
Well, that's true.

179
00:18:54,566 --> 00:18:56,295
Listen, girlie...

180
00:18:56,368 --> 00:19:01,328
these glasses are six for $2
because I couldn't carry 12.

181
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:05,709
But I wanted 12.
So today, I'm buying six more.

182
00:19:05,777 --> 00:19:08,712
But you should only charge me
$1.50 for them.

183
00:19:11,683 --> 00:19:14,652
It's all right. You can ask the manager.

184
00:19:16,421 --> 00:19:18,821
Frank, I need a price check.

185
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:25,119
Man, old Jewish ladies will argue forever
with a cashier about anything.

186
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:26,221
These glasses...

187
00:19:26,298 --> 00:19:28,960
You get behind them in line
and you're gonna wait forever.

188
00:19:29,034 --> 00:19:32,629
...because I couldn't carry 12. So today...

189
00:19:32,704 --> 00:19:34,331
I'm a yid myself...

190
00:19:34,406 --> 00:19:38,365
and women in my family are like that,
but I never got used to it.

191
00:19:38,944 --> 00:19:41,469
I mean, I may be cheap,
but I got limits, man.

192
00:19:41,547 --> 00:19:43,981
Let me explain one more time.

193
00:19:44,383 --> 00:19:48,114
These glasses are six for $2...

194
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:53,121
Wake up! Your whole life's
getting eaten away with this kind of crap.

195
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:55,160
What kind of existence is this?

196
00:19:55,661 --> 00:19:58,391
Is this all a working stiff
like you can expect?

197
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:03,292
You gonna suffer in silence for the rest
of your life, or are you gonna make a mark?

198
00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:15,312
Okay, I have the money right here.
Even money, $1.50.

199
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,848
You don't even have to
open the cash register.

200
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:19,975
Even change. And, dear...

201
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:28,480
Oh, shit!

202
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:32,981
Ever since I read your stuff, man,
I've been thinking...

203
00:21:33,158 --> 00:21:35,023
I can write comic book stories...

204
00:21:35,093 --> 00:21:38,324
that are different from anything
that's been done.

205
00:21:41,533 --> 00:21:44,969
I figure the guys who are doing
animal comics...

206
00:21:45,037 --> 00:21:48,165
and superhero stuff, they're really limited.

207
00:21:48,674 --> 00:21:51,165
Because they got to try to appeal to kids.

208
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:55,239
And underground stuff like yours
has been really subversive...

209
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:57,145
and it's opened things up politically...

210
00:21:57,215 --> 00:22:00,241
but there's still plenty more
to be done with them, too.

211
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,980
Pass the ketchup.

212
00:22:03,955 --> 00:22:07,618
The words, the pictures,
they could be more of an art form.

213
00:22:08,226 --> 00:22:10,660
You know, like those French movies...

214
00:22:12,764 --> 00:22:14,391
or De Sica over in Italy.

215
00:22:19,404 --> 00:22:21,634
So, anyway, I tried...

216
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:26,939
I tried writing some stuff about real life...

217
00:22:27,379 --> 00:22:30,041
stuff that the everyman's got to deal with.

218
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:34,280
These are all about you?

219
00:22:35,721 --> 00:22:36,949
Yeah.

220
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:40,214
You've turned yourself into a comic hero.

221
00:22:40,292 --> 00:22:43,159
Sort of, but there's no idealized shit.

222
00:22:43,962 --> 00:22:47,295
There's no phony bullshit.
This is the real thing, man.

223
00:22:49,101 --> 00:22:51,865
You know, ordinary life
is pretty complex stuff.

224
00:22:57,008 --> 00:22:59,670
These are really...

225
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:03,173
good.

226
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:08,811
Really, you think so?

227
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:11,378
Yeah, this is great stuff. I dig it.

228
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:15,923
Can I take them home and illustrate them?

229
00:23:24,136 --> 00:23:26,536
You'd really do that for me, man?

230
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:32,203
That would be great because
I can't even draw a straight line, Bob.

231
00:23:32,944 --> 00:23:36,744
What's up with your voice, Harv?
All of a sudden, you sound fine.

232
00:23:38,283 --> 00:23:42,185
I don't know, man. I guess you cured me.

233
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:02,934
That Bonnie, her legs go forever.

234
00:25:03,101 --> 00:25:04,728
How smart is she?

235
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:08,337
I don't know. I guess she's about average.

236
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:12,341
Average? Hey, man, average is dumb.

237
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:18,144
So what if she's dumb? I don't care.

238
00:25:20,585 --> 00:25:22,883
"Hey, man, average is dumb."

239
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:26,585
Fuck that. That's all stories by yours truly.

240
00:25:26,658 --> 00:25:28,819
- Hot off the presses?
- That's right.

241
00:25:28,894 --> 00:25:30,691
We have a regular Hemingway here.

242
00:25:30,762 --> 00:25:33,253
No way, I don't go in
for any of that macho crap.

243
00:25:33,331 --> 00:25:35,162
I didn't know you could draw.

244
00:25:35,233 --> 00:25:38,430
No, I don't draw, doc. I write the stories.

245
00:25:39,004 --> 00:25:43,134
- Harvey, am I in here?
- You're in there, all right? Take it easy.

246
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:47,106
A buddy of mine and some of his friends
do the art work.

247
00:25:47,178 --> 00:25:48,805
Let me see this.

248
00:25:49,147 --> 00:25:52,674
Mr. Boats, it's not polite to grab things.
Next time...

249
00:25:59,024 --> 00:26:00,548
It's not bad.

250
00:26:02,027 --> 00:26:03,892
Son, you done good.

251
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:08,322
But you know, I was up in Toronto
a few weeks back.

252
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,836
I saw the Red Chinese ballet.
Now, that was beautiful.

253
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:13,837
The way those people
were dancing together...

254
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:17,341
those Chinese, they work hard, I tell you.

255
00:26:19,277 --> 00:26:20,938
Where's everybody going?

256
00:26:29,521 --> 00:26:32,046
Where are you sick men rushing off to?

257
00:26:34,225 --> 00:26:36,557
You ain't going nowhere for now.

258
00:26:36,795 --> 00:26:38,990
Probably not for a long time.

259
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:43,063
But damn if they're not a rushing off
to get there.

260
00:26:58,984 --> 00:27:03,614
Harvey, how do your co-workers and friends
feel about you putting them in your comics?

261
00:27:03,688 --> 00:27:06,418
They love it. They can't get enough of it.

262
00:27:08,693 --> 00:27:12,754
They come up to me demanding to know
why I'm not in the new issue.

263
00:27:13,098 --> 00:27:14,565
Most of them.

264
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:18,592
What about overhearing what people say?
Are you always listening at work?

265
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:21,036
Were you listening riding the bus?

266
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:24,108
- The supermarket?
- Yeah, I listen.

267
00:27:25,844 --> 00:27:28,677
I fall asleep on people, too,
but I listen some.

268
00:27:43,795 --> 00:27:46,320
Here's our man, eight comics later.

269
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:51,767
A brand new decade, same old bullshit.

270
00:27:55,907 --> 00:27:58,899
Sure, he gets lots of recognition
for his writing now.

271
00:27:59,944 --> 00:28:04,574
His comics are praised by all the important
media types telling people what to think.

272
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:06,506
But so what?

273
00:28:06,818 --> 00:28:10,379
It's not like he makes
a living at it, like Bob Crumb.

274
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:13,957
He can't go and quit his day job or nothing.

275
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:20,891
Who am I kidding?

276
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:24,693
Truth is, I'd be lost without my work routine.

277
00:28:37,015 --> 00:28:38,448
I got a job.

278
00:28:51,763 --> 00:28:53,094
Hi, Harvey.

279
00:28:53,164 --> 00:28:55,291
Do you want these gourmet jelly beans?

280
00:28:55,366 --> 00:28:57,459
I gave up sweets for Lent.

281
00:28:58,436 --> 00:29:02,133
- Yeah, sure, I'll take them.
- I recommend the pina coladas.

282
00:29:02,607 --> 00:29:05,872
They're excellent and very authentic tasting.

283
00:29:10,281 --> 00:29:12,579
It's watermelon. That's pretty good.

284
00:29:12,684 --> 00:29:15,175
Wait till you try the pina coladas.

285
00:29:25,163 --> 00:29:26,824
Tell me something.

286
00:29:28,066 --> 00:29:30,432
Can you eat lentils during Lent?

287
00:29:32,137 --> 00:29:34,162
Sure, I don't see why not.

288
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:36,263
You can't eat meat on certain days...

289
00:29:36,341 --> 00:29:39,242
but lentils should be acceptable anytime.

290
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:45,879
Do you think there's any connection
between lentils and Lent?

291
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:50,387
I don't think so. But I'll ask Sister Mary Fred
at church on Sunday.

292
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:53,154
Sister Mary Fred, huh?

293
00:29:54,592 --> 00:29:58,551
Is she cute? She sounds kind of mannish,
but who the hell am I to be picky?

294
00:29:59,931 --> 00:30:02,729
You're funny. She's a nun.

295
00:30:03,434 --> 00:30:07,564
So what? Maybe she became a nun
because she couldn't get a guy.

296
00:30:09,007 --> 00:30:13,103
She became a nun
because she had a higher calling.

297
00:30:13,845 --> 00:30:16,109
Higher calling? What a crock of shit.

298
00:30:16,781 --> 00:30:19,579
I don't even know why you
bother praying anyway.

299
00:30:19,717 --> 00:30:23,483
I enjoy the ritual,
and I'm a very spiritual person.

300
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:28,220
You know, you should try
believing in something bigger than yourself.

301
00:30:28,393 --> 00:30:30,258
It might cheer you up.

302
00:30:34,732 --> 00:30:36,757
What, do I seem depressed?

303
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:57,913
Cut!

304
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:01,552
That was great, guys.
The bakery scene's next.

305
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,924
The bakery scene's next?
I didn't know of a bakery scene.

306
00:31:04,996 --> 00:31:07,521
Did you ever hear of a bakery scene?

307
00:31:09,434 --> 00:31:12,164
Bakery is my scene, but not in that way.

308
00:31:12,337 --> 00:31:15,135
Forget the bakery, let's eat some jelly beans.

309
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:20,033
I think one might be lime.
One might be mint.

310
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:23,843
What's the difference between this and this?

311
00:31:23,915 --> 00:31:25,849
One's cherry, one's cinnamon.

312
00:31:25,917 --> 00:31:28,147
You could tell that by just looking at them?

313
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:31,313
Not me. I have to put it in my mouth first.

314
00:31:36,294 --> 00:31:38,524
Loneliness can feel so bad.

315
00:31:39,297 --> 00:31:41,162
There have been times I've felt lonely...

316
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:44,167
'cause a lot of the time,
it was just me and my grandmother.

317
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:46,829
I'd just be sitting in my room all day...

318
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:49,635
watching television or reading books.

319
00:31:49,807 --> 00:31:52,537
That was before
I bought a computer, of course.

320
00:31:53,878 --> 00:31:56,278
How do you cope with loneliness, Harvey?

321
00:31:57,682 --> 00:32:00,981
- Did I say I watched television?
- You mentioned you watch TV...

322
00:32:01,052 --> 00:32:04,351
you listen to your jazz records, you read...

323
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:07,585
you write, you drew your stick figures...

324
00:32:08,993 --> 00:32:11,962
so you could plan for your next comic book.

325
00:32:13,898 --> 00:32:16,560
I've seen many of your stick figures.

326
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:19,495
That seems to be pretty interesting.

327
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:22,539
- Chocolate jelly beans, I'm gonna try one.
- Go ahead.

328
00:32:48,166 --> 00:32:49,895
Excuse me, can I help you?

329
00:32:53,037 --> 00:32:54,368
Give me...

330
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:56,606
two crullers...

331
00:32:58,042 --> 00:33:00,010
jelly doughnut with the powdered sugar.

332
00:33:00,078 --> 00:33:01,739
Thanks for coming.

333
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:05,112
- You got any of that day-old bread?
- I think so.

334
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:10,653
Here you go.

335
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:14,981
$3.

336
00:33:16,294 --> 00:33:18,057
You're Harvey Pekar?

337
00:33:19,964 --> 00:33:22,296
Alice Quinn, from school.

338
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:28,965
College, yeah.

339
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:31,873
We had a couple of Lit classes together.

340
00:33:31,943 --> 00:33:35,845
What happened to you?
You disappeared after two semesters.

341
00:33:36,114 --> 00:33:37,809
Yeah, I know.

342
00:33:38,883 --> 00:33:43,479
I got good grades and all,
but there was that required Math class...

343
00:33:43,554 --> 00:33:44,851
hanging over my head.

344
00:33:44,922 --> 00:33:47,948
Eventually, the pressure
got to be too much, so...

345
00:33:49,927 --> 00:33:51,417
You're doing okay, anyway.

346
00:33:51,496 --> 00:33:54,795
I heard all about
your jazz reviews and your comics.

347
00:33:55,433 --> 00:33:58,561
- You did?
- Sure, you're famous.

348
00:33:59,804 --> 00:34:03,570
Meanwhile, I got my degree
and I'm just a plain old wife and mother.

349
00:34:12,083 --> 00:34:14,608
I'm not doing as great as you think.

350
00:34:15,987 --> 00:34:18,922
My second wife divorced me,
I work a dead end job...

351
00:34:19,924 --> 00:34:21,619
as a file clerk.

352
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:25,128
Sometimes I hang out
with the guys on the corner...

353
00:34:25,196 --> 00:34:28,495
but most of the time
I just stay at home by myself and I read.

354
00:34:30,034 --> 00:34:31,968
You're luckier than you think.

355
00:34:32,103 --> 00:34:34,537
Between my husband and my kids...

356
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:38,004
it's impossible for me
to curl up with a good book.

357
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:45,545
I'm reading this book by Dreiser now.

358
00:34:46,951 --> 00:34:49,852
- Jennie Gerhardt.
- That's one of my favorites.

359
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:51,013
Yeah?

360
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:56,185
I hope that book don't end like
so many of those naturalist novels...

361
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:59,752
with someone getting crushed to earth...

362
00:34:59,831 --> 00:35:01,822
by forces he can't control.

363
00:35:01,899 --> 00:35:04,026
I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.

364
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:07,003
I mean, it's certainly
not your Hollywood happy ending...

365
00:35:07,071 --> 00:35:10,700
but it's pretty truthful,
which is rare these days.

366
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:14,869
- This is me.
- All right.

367
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:23,185
- Nice car.
- Thanks.

368
00:35:23,254 --> 00:35:26,621
- I don't have one yet.
- Can I give you a lift somewhere?

369
00:35:27,725 --> 00:35:30,751
No, that's all right.
It's a nice day, I'll just walk.

370
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:45,101
It was nice seeing you.

371
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:12,033
When I got home,
I finished reading Jennie Gerhardt.

372
00:36:12,937 --> 00:36:16,202
It was real good. That Alice was right.

373
00:36:18,876 --> 00:36:22,175
Sure, Lester, the main character,
croaks in the end...

374
00:36:23,314 --> 00:36:26,875
but at least he's old
and dies a natural, dignified death.

375
00:36:30,888 --> 00:36:33,584
I was more alone that weekend than any.

376
00:36:33,958 --> 00:36:36,927
Sometimes in my sleep,
I'd feel a body next to me...

377
00:36:37,094 --> 00:36:39,722
like an amputee feels a phantom limb.

378
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:46,598
All I did was think about Jennie Gerhardt
and Alice Quinn...

379
00:36:46,671 --> 00:36:49,469
and all the decades of people I had known.

380
00:36:50,074 --> 00:36:53,168
The more I thought,
the more I felt like crying.

381
00:36:54,512 --> 00:36:57,640
Life seemed so sweet and so sad...

382
00:36:57,715 --> 00:37:00,377
and so hard to let go of in the end.

383
00:37:01,652 --> 00:37:05,315
But hey, man,
every day is a brand new deal, right?

384
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:09,016
Just keep on working
and something's bound to turn up.

385
00:37:33,351 --> 00:37:36,013
What happened to
the new American Splendor?

386
00:37:36,621 --> 00:37:39,351
- I think we sold them, babe.
- All of them?

387
00:37:40,124 --> 00:37:41,250
Yeah.

388
00:37:42,226 --> 00:37:46,128
Rand, I put one aside for myself
next to the register.

389
00:37:46,197 --> 00:37:48,859
I haven't even had time to read it yet.

390
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:52,300
Sorry, Joyce, I didn't know
you were such a Splendor fan.

391
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:54,638
Next time, take it home.

392
00:38:02,046 --> 00:38:04,139
Maybe I'll call the publisher.

393
00:38:04,215 --> 00:38:06,149
It'll take so damn long. Shit!

394
00:38:07,151 --> 00:38:11,417
Why does everything in my life
have to be such a complicated disaster?

395
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:16,287
- Okay, maybe we can call someone...
- What is this?

396
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:18,590
All right. Okay.

397
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:22,896
I'm gonna hustle
before the vibe in here gets any worse.

398
00:38:24,335 --> 00:38:25,996
You can just hang.

399
00:38:37,615 --> 00:38:39,276
"Dear Mr. Pekar...

400
00:38:43,854 --> 00:38:47,312
"greetings from the second smallest state
in the Union...

401
00:38:50,961 --> 00:38:53,862
"an endless plastics and nylon plantation...

402
00:38:53,931 --> 00:38:56,559
"controlled by giant chemical corporations.

403
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:03,732
"To make matters more dismal, there are
no decent comic book stores in my town...

404
00:39:03,808 --> 00:39:07,107
"which is why my partner and I
opened one ourselves.

405
00:39:09,413 --> 00:39:11,711
"Despite our steadily faltering business...

406
00:39:11,782 --> 00:39:16,310
"my partner managed to sell the last copy
of American Splendor Number 8...

407
00:39:16,387 --> 00:39:18,116
"out from under me.

408
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:22,491
"I'm a big fan,
and I hate to wait for a new order.

409
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:25,290
"Is there any way
I can get it from you direct?

410
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:27,126
"Sincerely, Joyce Brabner."

411
00:39:27,231 --> 00:39:29,495
She's got good-looking handwriting.

412
00:39:33,738 --> 00:39:36,104
"Dear Joyce, thanks for the..."

413
00:39:46,117 --> 00:39:48,847
"Dear Joyce, thanks for the letter.

414
00:39:49,019 --> 00:39:50,987
"What do you do besides selling comics?"

415
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:54,547
Anybody in the room ever done
any creative writing of any sort?

416
00:39:56,660 --> 00:40:00,152
"I'm a sometime activist,
and I teach writing to prisoners.

417
00:40:00,631 --> 00:40:02,929
"I try to help them build an interior life...

418
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,333
"and make art out of
their monotonous, suffocating routine."

419
00:40:06,837 --> 00:40:08,634
This sounds familiar.

420
00:40:08,806 --> 00:40:10,831
"So you married or what?"

421
00:40:11,175 --> 00:40:13,075
"I'm divorced, thank God."

422
00:40:15,146 --> 00:40:18,775
Look, I think you and I
got a lot in common, you know?

423
00:40:20,117 --> 00:40:22,847
How am I gonna get you
to come visit me in Cleveland?

424
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,353
- Cleveland?
- Yeah.

425
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:26,219
You think that's a good idea?

426
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:28,053
It's a great idea.

427
00:40:28,125 --> 00:40:31,060
You should meet me
because I'm a great guy.

428
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:33,988
Despite the way my comics read...

429
00:40:34,064 --> 00:40:36,931
I got a lot of redeeming characteristics.

430
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:40,502
I don't know. Where would I stay?

431
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:42,398
I don't know. With me.

432
00:40:42,473 --> 00:40:45,704
Don't worry.
I'm not gonna put no moves on you.

433
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:47,243
I'm not worried about that.

434
00:40:47,311 --> 00:40:50,439
Hold on,
I just spilled my chamomile tea all over me.

435
00:40:51,849 --> 00:40:54,409
So what are you worried about then?

436
00:40:58,255 --> 00:41:01,918
It's the way all the different artists draw you.

437
00:41:01,992 --> 00:41:04,517
- What?
- I don't really know what to expect.

438
00:41:04,595 --> 00:41:07,063
Sometimes you look like a younger Brando.

439
00:41:07,231 --> 00:41:09,791
But then, the way Crumb draws you...

440
00:41:10,367 --> 00:41:12,858
you look like a hairy ape, with all these...

441
00:41:13,671 --> 00:41:17,198
wavy, stinky lines undulating off your body.

442
00:41:17,274 --> 00:41:19,105
I don't really know what to expect.

443
00:41:19,176 --> 00:41:21,804
No, those are motion lines.

444
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,507
I'm an active guy.

445
00:41:25,216 --> 00:41:27,650
Look, just come out here...

446
00:41:27,785 --> 00:41:31,721
and I will try to be anyone
that you want me to be, okay?

447
00:41:32,923 --> 00:41:36,552
That's a dangerous offer.
I'm a notorious reformer.

448
00:42:23,774 --> 00:42:25,298
Are you Joyce?

449
00:42:26,944 --> 00:42:28,434
- Hey, Harvey.
- Hey.

450
00:42:28,646 --> 00:42:30,944
- So we finally meet in person.
- Yeah.

451
00:42:34,418 --> 00:42:39,014
Look, before we get started with any of this,
you might as well know I had a vasectomy.

452
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:03,573
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

453
00:43:04,815 --> 00:43:07,875
Something's wrong.
You keep looking around everywhere.

454
00:43:08,385 --> 00:43:12,378
I guess I never imagined
you'd eat in a place like this.

455
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:15,821
What, me? No, I've never been here.

456
00:43:18,395 --> 00:43:20,556
I thought you'd like it.

457
00:43:22,132 --> 00:43:26,501
- But obviously you don't, do you?
- No, it's fine. What difference does it make?

458
00:43:29,506 --> 00:43:31,269
I don't know. None, I guess.

459
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,646
They got a lot of meat on this menu.

460
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:41,547
You're a vegetarian?

461
00:43:42,252 --> 00:43:44,447
Kind of, you know, I mean...

462
00:43:45,089 --> 00:43:47,421
Ever since I got a pet cat...

463
00:43:47,491 --> 00:43:50,358
I've had a lot of trouble eating animals.

464
00:43:54,798 --> 00:43:57,961
I support and identify
with groups like PETA...

465
00:43:58,035 --> 00:44:00,868
but unfortunately,
I'm a self-diagnosed anemic.

466
00:44:04,508 --> 00:44:07,272
Also, I have all these
food allergies to vegetables...

467
00:44:07,344 --> 00:44:09,869
which give me serious intestinal distress.

468
00:44:12,683 --> 00:44:15,151
I guess I have
a lot of borderline health disorders...

469
00:44:15,219 --> 00:44:18,052
that limit me politically
when it comes to eating.

470
00:44:21,525 --> 00:44:23,493
You're a sick woman.

471
00:44:24,161 --> 00:44:25,753
Not yet, but I expect to be.

472
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:29,287
Everyone in my family
has some sort of degenerative illness.

473
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:33,026
Good evening.

474
00:44:47,317 --> 00:44:49,080
I was gonna clean up...

475
00:44:49,153 --> 00:44:51,917
but why should I give you
any false notions?

476
00:44:52,256 --> 00:44:56,192
The truth is,
I got a serious problem with cleanliness.

477
00:44:57,394 --> 00:45:00,488
If I had to wash a dish 10 times,
it'd still be dirty.

478
00:45:01,231 --> 00:45:05,361
They even kicked me out of the army
'cause I couldn't learn to make a bed.

479
00:45:07,905 --> 00:45:09,304
I've seen worse.

480
00:45:14,445 --> 00:45:16,936
Could you get me some water
and a few aspirin?

481
00:45:17,014 --> 00:45:18,709
What, you got a headache?

482
00:45:19,116 --> 00:45:21,676
- No, but I want to avoid one.
- Yeah.

483
00:45:38,635 --> 00:45:41,035
Let me tell you something.

484
00:45:42,306 --> 00:45:44,570
Sure is nice to have company.

485
00:45:45,843 --> 00:45:47,708
You know, I mean...

486
00:45:48,445 --> 00:45:51,573
despite all your problems,
you seem like a great person.

487
00:45:52,816 --> 00:45:55,842
I'm sorry if my dating skills are a little rusty.

488
00:45:57,121 --> 00:46:00,454
It's just that I've been through hell and back
with women.

489
00:46:02,292 --> 00:46:05,056
That last one turned out
to be a real nasty bitch.

490
00:46:06,497 --> 00:46:09,091
- I had a nice time with you, too.
- Yeah?

491
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:11,267
You had a nice time?

492
00:46:11,869 --> 00:46:14,861
Don't make people repeat themselves.
That's annoying.

493
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:17,968
Sorry.

494
00:46:23,147 --> 00:46:24,546
Come here.

495
00:46:55,279 --> 00:46:57,076
Which way is the bathroom?

496
00:46:58,048 --> 00:47:00,448
Through the kitchen, on the right.

497
00:47:11,962 --> 00:47:14,328
Joyce, what's wrong? What is it?

498
00:47:15,299 --> 00:47:18,132
I don't know.
I think that yuppie food did me in.

499
00:47:21,605 --> 00:47:23,300
I feel terrible.

500
00:47:25,042 --> 00:47:27,704
Let me at least do something for you.

501
00:47:27,778 --> 00:47:29,837
Can I make you something?

502
00:47:31,481 --> 00:47:34,382
- How about some chamomile tea?
- Chamomile tea?

503
00:47:34,785 --> 00:47:39,188
What's a guy like you doing with that?
I thought you drank soda pop for breakfast.

504
00:47:39,756 --> 00:47:44,284
I just noticed you drank a lot of it
when we started talking on the phone.

505
00:47:44,928 --> 00:47:47,829
The girl at the food co-op...

506
00:47:48,732 --> 00:47:51,633
she picked me out all kinds
of this herbal stuff.

507
00:47:55,072 --> 00:47:57,632
One of these is good
for stomach aches. Here.

508
00:47:58,542 --> 00:48:01,443
Grandma Bear's Tummy Mint or something,
I think.

509
00:48:05,482 --> 00:48:07,211
Hey, are you still there?

510
00:48:18,262 --> 00:48:21,823
I think we should skip the whole
courtship thing and just get married.

511
00:48:32,075 --> 00:48:35,169
Man, am I glad
I talked you into coming up here.

512
00:48:35,545 --> 00:48:39,174
You know, any more time alone,
I really might have lost it.

513
00:48:40,017 --> 00:48:41,177
Me, too.

514
00:48:45,856 --> 00:48:48,825
You don't have any problems
with moving to Cleveland?

515
00:48:49,493 --> 00:48:50,482
Not really.

516
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:54,394
I find most American cities
to be depressing in the same way.

517
00:49:00,537 --> 00:49:03,370
And you're okay with the vasectomy thing?

518
00:49:24,695 --> 00:49:25,719
Hey, Toby.

519
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:28,822
No, you can't have
any of my White Castle hamburger...

520
00:49:28,899 --> 00:49:30,833
so please don't even ask.

521
00:49:31,702 --> 00:49:35,297
- Yeah? Can I have a fry?
- Okay, but just a couple, Harvey.

522
00:49:35,872 --> 00:49:38,363
I'm not going to be eating dinner
until very late...

523
00:49:38,442 --> 00:49:40,535
and this has got to hold me over.

524
00:49:40,610 --> 00:49:42,271
What have you got, a church function?

525
00:49:42,346 --> 00:49:46,806
No, I'm driving to Toledo to see a movie.
Would you like to come?

526
00:49:48,585 --> 00:49:52,419
No, I gotta go to Delaware tonight.
I'm getting married.

527
00:49:53,557 --> 00:49:57,323
- Why Delaware?
- The chick I'm marrying is from Wilmington.

528
00:49:57,861 --> 00:50:00,762
Plus, I got to help her
move her stuff back here.

529
00:50:02,766 --> 00:50:05,496
Why are you driving to Toledo
to see a movie?

530
00:50:05,569 --> 00:50:07,730
It's not playing at the Mapletown.

531
00:50:08,638 --> 00:50:12,267
- I didn't know you had a girlfriend.
- Yeah, we met last week.

532
00:50:22,119 --> 00:50:26,681
What movie could possibly be worth
driving 260 miles roundtrip for?

533
00:50:27,491 --> 00:50:31,018
It's a new film called Revenge of the Nerds.

534
00:50:31,328 --> 00:50:33,694
It's about a group of nerd college students...

535
00:50:33,764 --> 00:50:36,699
who are being picked on
all the time by the jocks.

536
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:38,825
So they decide to take revenge.

537
00:50:39,569 --> 00:50:43,300
So what you're saying is
you identify with those nerds?

538
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:46,473
Yes, I consider myself a nerd...

539
00:50:46,843 --> 00:50:49,243
and this movie has uplifted me.

540
00:50:51,348 --> 00:50:55,842
There's this one scene where a nerd
grabs the microphone during a pep rally...

541
00:50:56,086 --> 00:50:59,544
and announces that he is a nerd
and that he is proud of it...

542
00:50:59,623 --> 00:51:02,217
and stands up for the rights of other nerds.

543
00:51:02,325 --> 00:51:05,488
- Right on.
- Then he asks all the kids at the pep rally...

544
00:51:05,562 --> 00:51:08,087
who think they are nerds, to come forward.

545
00:51:11,201 --> 00:51:15,604
So nearly everyone in the place does.
That's the way the movie ends.

546
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:19,001
- So the nerds won?
- Yes.

547
00:51:20,577 --> 00:51:21,669
All right.

548
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:26,313
You know, you got this movie,
and I'm getting hitched.

549
00:51:26,383 --> 00:51:28,749
- We both had a good month.
- Right.

550
00:51:38,829 --> 00:51:40,490
- Harvey? Wait!
- Yeah?

551
00:51:40,997 --> 00:51:45,366
How long will you be in Delaware?
Because I'd like to see this movie with you.

552
00:51:47,537 --> 00:51:49,971
I don't know. I'm gonna be gone a week.

553
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:54,704
But then, I'm gonna have a wife.
So I'm going to have to bring her along, too.

554
00:51:55,145 --> 00:51:56,840
Is it a girl flick?

555
00:51:57,614 --> 00:52:01,141
Depends on the girl.
What kind of girl is your new bride?

556
00:52:01,651 --> 00:52:03,050
Is she a nerd?

557
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:05,647
I don't know, man.

558
00:52:06,223 --> 00:52:08,817
Maybe, yeah. She's into herbal tea.

559
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:26,334
I did end up becoming a character
in his comics.

560
00:52:28,845 --> 00:52:33,407
Harvey tends to push
the negative or the sour.

561
00:52:33,483 --> 00:52:38,113
And he can be very depressed,
and therefore very depressing.

562
00:52:40,357 --> 00:52:43,053
Harvey, do you think
you portray Joyce fairly?

563
00:52:43,126 --> 00:52:46,323
Yeah, I think I portray her fairly.

564
00:52:50,934 --> 00:52:54,392
There's some things that she does
that I don't put in there...

565
00:52:58,341 --> 00:53:01,504
for obvious reasons.
I don't wanna get my head cut off.

566
00:53:04,414 --> 00:53:08,748
I think my portrayal is generally
fairly accurate.

567
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:13,180
There've been stories
that I've participated in...

568
00:53:13,256 --> 00:53:16,748
or things that have happened,
and I've seen them...

569
00:53:17,961 --> 00:53:21,863
as a lot more happy things going on
in there. He just doesn't put that in...

570
00:53:21,932 --> 00:53:25,868
because he just doesn't think
that sunshine and flowers sell.

571
00:53:27,804 --> 00:53:29,294
Is that right?

572
00:53:29,673 --> 00:53:32,369
You always say, "Misery loves company."

573
00:53:35,278 --> 00:53:38,270
You know, I'm just a gloomy guy, that's all.

574
00:53:40,750 --> 00:53:43,310
It's my perspective: gloom and doom.

575
00:53:43,587 --> 00:53:47,353
And see, I thought I was marrying somebody
with a sense of humor.

576
00:53:49,192 --> 00:53:50,682
I guess I fooled you.

577
00:53:52,162 --> 00:53:53,925
What a crock of shit, man.

578
00:53:53,997 --> 00:53:54,898
- That's not the point.
- You missed the whole point of the movie.

579
00:53:54,898 --> 00:53:57,230
- That's not the point.
- You missed the whole point of the movie.

580
00:53:57,300 --> 00:54:01,293
Where the hell am I supposed to find
the point in garbage?

581
00:54:02,806 --> 00:54:06,264
I agree with Toby.
I think it's a story of hope and tolerance.

582
00:54:06,843 --> 00:54:11,041
Yes, it's about time that the people
who get picked on get to be the heroes.

583
00:54:11,281 --> 00:54:14,842
It's an entertaining flick and all,
and I can see why you like it, Toby.

584
00:54:14,918 --> 00:54:18,718
But those people on the screen
ain't even supposed to be you.

585
00:54:18,788 --> 00:54:20,722
They're college students...

586
00:54:20,790 --> 00:54:24,055
who live with their parents
in big houses in the suburbs.

587
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:28,460
They're gonna get degrees, get good jobs,
and they're gonna stop being nerds.

588
00:54:28,531 --> 00:54:32,092
Remember what I told you
about loud talking? Use your inside voice.

589
00:54:32,168 --> 00:54:34,728
Look, Toby, the guys in that movie...

590
00:54:34,804 --> 00:54:38,171
are not 28-year-old file clerks
who live with their grandmother...

591
00:54:38,241 --> 00:54:40,106
- in an ethnic ghetto.
- That's enough.

592
00:54:40,176 --> 00:54:42,701
They didn't get their computers
the way you did...

593
00:54:42,779 --> 00:54:46,681
by trading in a bunch of box tops
and $49.50 at the supermarket.

594
00:54:46,750 --> 00:54:48,377
You're funny, Harvey.

595
00:54:48,718 --> 00:54:50,242
I'm getting in the front.

596
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:54,147
Sure, Toby, fine.
You go to the movies and daydream...

597
00:54:54,224 --> 00:54:58,661
but this Revenge of the Nerds ain't reality.
It's Hollywood bullshit.

598
00:54:58,795 --> 00:55:00,353
Harvey, let him alone.

599
00:55:01,665 --> 00:55:06,159
The thing that I loved about it is
I was transported to another time in my life.

600
00:55:06,236 --> 00:55:09,637
- I like when they took the video cameras...
- lf everyone could see it...

601
00:55:09,706 --> 00:55:11,867
It's the same as the "I Have a Dream"
speech.

602
00:55:11,941 --> 00:55:13,067
It's very empowering.

603
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:17,045
Maybe I was being so harsh on Toby
on account of my own problems.

604
00:55:17,414 --> 00:55:19,211
You see, I wasn't even married a month...

605
00:55:19,282 --> 00:55:22,683
and my old lady
was already showing signs of trouble.

606
00:55:22,852 --> 00:55:27,346
Granted, I tend to get married fast,
'cause I'll take any woman that'll have me.

607
00:55:28,291 --> 00:55:30,589
But this time I really met my match.

608
00:55:32,829 --> 00:55:36,595
How about these old 78s? Can't you
sell them to one of your collectors?

609
00:55:36,666 --> 00:55:38,827
Are you kidding me, man? No way.

610
00:55:38,902 --> 00:55:41,336
I ain't getting rid of my 78s.

611
00:55:41,471 --> 00:55:43,166
Forget it, then. I give up.

612
00:55:43,239 --> 00:55:46,538
How can I make more storage space
if you won't get rid of anything?

613
00:55:46,609 --> 00:55:49,134
You know what? I'll get rid of stuff.

614
00:55:49,312 --> 00:55:52,247
- Just not my good stuff.
- Everything is your good stuff.

615
00:55:52,315 --> 00:55:55,113
How am I supposed to live here
if there's no room for me?

616
00:55:55,185 --> 00:55:56,675
Come on, baby.

617
00:55:57,354 --> 00:55:59,379
I'll make room for you, okay?

618
00:55:59,656 --> 00:56:02,648
You just have to give me time.
I'm not so good at these things.

619
00:56:02,726 --> 00:56:05,217
- Because you're obsessive-compulsive.
- Come on!

620
00:56:05,295 --> 00:56:07,229
I don't wanna hear that psycho-babble crap.

621
00:56:07,297 --> 00:56:11,199
I don't care if you don't wanna hear it.
You are the poster child for the DSM III.

622
00:56:11,267 --> 00:56:14,600
I'll have you know
I come from a very dysfunctional family.

623
00:56:14,671 --> 00:56:17,765
I can spot a personality disorder miles away.

624
00:56:21,378 --> 00:56:22,606
Hello, Joyce.

625
00:56:23,446 --> 00:56:25,038
Is Harvey home?

626
00:56:26,783 --> 00:56:28,273
Borderline autistic.

627
00:56:33,556 --> 00:56:36,821
Are you listening to me?
I tell you, that Toby is a spy.

628
00:56:41,097 --> 00:56:43,497
Paranoid personality disorder.

629
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:58,643
Polymorphously perverse.

630
00:57:02,252 --> 00:57:03,913
Hey, leave a message.

631
00:57:05,255 --> 00:57:07,348
This is me. Pick up the phone.

632
00:57:07,857 --> 00:57:09,950
You're not going to believe this...

633
00:57:10,026 --> 00:57:13,826
but some LA producer called
and wants to do a play about my life.

634
00:57:13,897 --> 00:57:15,865
Call me back. Call me here.

635
00:57:17,667 --> 00:57:19,567
Delusions of grandeur.

636
00:57:42,525 --> 00:57:46,222
See, I think comics
can pretty much be an art form, man.

637
00:57:46,296 --> 00:57:49,732
I mean, the pictures can be
as good as they want to be...

638
00:57:49,799 --> 00:57:52,267
and the words can be
as good as they want to be...

639
00:57:52,335 --> 00:57:55,566
and a man can do pretty much
anything he wants to.

640
00:57:58,408 --> 00:58:02,845
That's true, but I didn't come all the way
from Delaware to talk about comics.

641
00:58:33,409 --> 00:58:36,901
Where is my American splendor

642
00:58:37,780 --> 00:58:41,307
in a world that's cloudy and gray?

643
00:58:42,051 --> 00:58:47,045
Where life keeps passing by me day by day

644
00:58:50,193 --> 00:58:53,959
Where is my American splendor

645
00:58:54,597 --> 00:58:58,260
in a world that's cloudy and gray?

646
00:58:58,801 --> 00:59:03,795
Where life keeps passing by me day by day

647
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:10,577
If you think reading comics about your life
seems strange...

648
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:12,614
try watching a play about it.

649
00:59:13,449 --> 00:59:16,213
God only knows how I'll feel
when I see this movie.

650
00:59:20,690 --> 00:59:23,386
Things were going pretty good for a change.

651
00:59:23,459 --> 00:59:26,360
Variety called me
"the blue-collar Mark Twain."

652
00:59:26,462 --> 00:59:30,990
Doubleday was interested in publishing
an anthology of American Splendor.

653
00:59:32,035 --> 00:59:34,970
I hate checking bags, man.
It always takes forever.

654
00:59:36,139 --> 00:59:40,940
The bus is gonna leave soon. That means
I gotta shell out an extra $30 for a cab.

655
00:59:45,815 --> 00:59:49,307
Figures. That lucky yuppie
is gonna get the bus in time.

656
00:59:55,058 --> 00:59:59,427
- You know, vasectomies are reversible.
- Goddamn yuppies get everything, man.

657
00:59:59,495 --> 01:00:02,896
Are you listening to me?
I said vasectomies are reversible.

658
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:05,929
What? What are you talking about?

659
01:00:07,036 --> 01:00:08,401
I don't want no kids.

660
01:00:08,471 --> 01:00:11,838
And I came clean about my vasectomy
the first time I set eyes on you.

661
01:00:11,908 --> 01:00:14,570
I know, but I think things have changed.

662
01:00:14,711 --> 01:00:17,475
- I think we can be a family.
- Family?

663
01:00:18,081 --> 01:00:20,481
Right. What kind of family
could we possibly be?

664
01:00:20,550 --> 01:00:22,279
I ain't no good with kids.

665
01:00:22,352 --> 01:00:25,116
Christ, I can barely take care of myself.

666
01:00:25,355 --> 01:00:27,346
I can take care of the kid and you.

667
01:00:27,423 --> 01:00:29,948
No way, Joyce. Forget it.

668
01:00:30,927 --> 01:00:33,418
I can't have no kids. I can't do it.

669
01:00:44,974 --> 01:00:47,943
Where the hell
is that Ornette Coleman album?

670
01:00:48,878 --> 01:00:51,540
You know, I got a review due tomorrow.

671
01:00:51,681 --> 01:00:54,878
I didn't touch it, Harvey.
Would you please let me sleep?

672
01:00:58,388 --> 01:01:02,722
Come on, it's 1:00.
How late can a person sleep, man?

673
01:01:06,963 --> 01:01:09,727
It happens to be Saturday,
you selfish son of a bitch.

674
01:01:09,799 --> 01:01:11,391
That don't make no difference.

675
01:01:11,467 --> 01:01:14,300
- Don't tell me what to do.
- I'm not telling you what to do.

676
01:01:14,370 --> 01:01:17,931
I'm the one who moved into your city,
into your home...

677
01:01:18,975 --> 01:01:20,772
into your vasectomy...

678
01:01:21,944 --> 01:01:23,411
into your whole screwed-up life.

679
01:01:23,479 --> 01:01:27,210
The least you could do
is allow me to live here in my own way.

680
01:01:32,855 --> 01:01:34,322
I tried everything...

681
01:01:34,390 --> 01:01:37,052
but nothing could get this woman
out of bed.

682
01:01:38,027 --> 01:01:41,224
I mean, she wouldn't get a job,
wouldn't go out...

683
01:01:41,297 --> 01:01:43,458
wouldn't make friends, nothing.

684
01:01:48,271 --> 01:01:51,104
Joyce diagnosed herself
as clinically depressed.

685
01:01:53,176 --> 01:01:55,804
I didn't know
what the hell she was going through...

686
01:01:55,878 --> 01:01:58,506
but it was sure taking its toll on me.

687
01:01:59,115 --> 01:02:02,448
Joyce, we got a message here.
How come you didn't...

688
01:02:04,087 --> 01:02:05,554
Useless, man.

689
01:02:09,859 --> 01:02:13,886
Hi. This is a message for Harvey Pekar.
My name is Jonathan Greene...

690
01:02:13,963 --> 01:02:16,557
and I'm a producer
of Late Night with David Letterman.

691
01:02:16,632 --> 01:02:19,795
We want to talk to you about coming
on the show to plug your comics.

692
01:02:19,869 --> 01:02:23,703
Please give us a call at 212-555-3333.

693
01:02:24,273 --> 01:02:25,262
Thanks.

694
01:02:28,511 --> 01:02:30,877
Joyce finally got off the futon.

695
01:03:23,599 --> 01:03:24,588
No.

696
01:03:26,068 --> 01:03:28,093
Come on, who the hell cares?

697
01:03:29,438 --> 01:03:31,804
- Jesus Christ.
- Give that to me.

698
01:03:31,874 --> 01:03:34,035
What the hell are you doing?

699
01:03:34,177 --> 01:03:35,701
Merchandising.

700
01:03:52,495 --> 01:03:54,725
- People like this show?
- Yeah.

701
01:03:56,599 --> 01:03:58,260
I can't believe my voice is going.

702
01:03:58,334 --> 01:04:00,962
What's the matter?
You were fine in the hotel.

703
01:04:01,704 --> 01:04:03,535
You want something to drink?

704
01:04:03,606 --> 01:04:06,074
I'm hungry. Aren't you hungry?

705
01:04:06,142 --> 01:04:09,703
They should give you
doughnuts or something. Look at this.

706
01:04:09,779 --> 01:04:12,213
- Dave's ready for you now.
- He is?

707
01:04:12,281 --> 01:04:14,841
You got something to eat?
'Cause my stomach is growling.

708
01:04:14,917 --> 01:04:17,283
- There's no time to eat.
- Come on.

709
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:19,784
Wait, what about the doll?

710
01:04:21,090 --> 01:04:23,422
He's got it at the desk.
Would you relax about that?

711
01:04:23,492 --> 01:04:25,426
- Guys, we're in a hurry.
- Okay.

712
01:04:26,362 --> 01:04:28,125
- Which way?
- Right this way.

713
01:04:31,868 --> 01:04:33,665
Thank you, boys.

714
01:04:33,736 --> 01:04:37,263
Our next guest tonight works as a file clerk
at a Cleveland hospital.

715
01:04:37,340 --> 01:04:41,071
He also writes comic books which deal
with his day-to-day pains and pleasures.

716
01:04:41,143 --> 01:04:43,543
This is an anthology
of the nine of those comics.

717
01:04:43,613 --> 01:04:45,410
It's entitled American Splendor.

718
01:04:45,481 --> 01:04:49,144
From off the streets of Cleveland, folks,
please say hello to Harvey Pekar.

719
01:04:49,218 --> 01:04:50,913
Harvey, come out here.

720
01:04:52,555 --> 01:04:53,544
Hi, Harvey.

721
01:04:54,190 --> 01:04:56,385
Thanks for coming out here.

722
01:04:58,828 --> 01:05:00,261
Have a seat.

723
01:05:01,464 --> 01:05:05,423
What do you mean calling me "curious"?
I met you before the show.

724
01:05:05,835 --> 01:05:08,804
- I meant "curious" in a fascinating way.
- All right.

725
01:05:08,871 --> 01:05:11,806
A man who has the presence
of one who is quite fascinating.

726
01:05:11,874 --> 01:05:15,674
'Cause I met you before the show.
I thought you were a pretty nice guy.

727
01:05:15,745 --> 01:05:19,476
I thought, wait a minute,
I might be nursing a viper in my bosom.

728
01:05:19,548 --> 01:05:20,913
Something like that.

729
01:05:20,983 --> 01:05:22,610
You're a little defensive about this?

730
01:05:22,685 --> 01:05:25,415
Yeah, I'm waiting for those Cleveland jokes.
Go ahead.

731
01:05:25,488 --> 01:05:27,956
- All right, settle down.
- Yeah, all right.

732
01:05:29,759 --> 01:05:32,853
Let's explain to folks
who may not be familiar with your work...

733
01:05:32,929 --> 01:05:34,556
what it is you do here exactly.

734
01:05:34,630 --> 01:05:38,623
You have comic books
about you in your daily life.

735
01:05:38,734 --> 01:05:42,465
And you also have a regular job
in Cleveland working at a hospital.

736
01:05:42,538 --> 01:05:43,698
That's right.

737
01:05:43,773 --> 01:05:46,367
- You know this guy?
- I'm beginning to wonder.

738
01:05:46,442 --> 01:05:49,809
You could probably get by on
what you make selling your work.

739
01:05:49,879 --> 01:05:53,576
Because people want you to write more,
and you're publishing this anthology.

740
01:05:53,649 --> 01:05:56,618
Who? What people?
What are you talking about?

741
01:05:56,919 --> 01:06:00,116
- Where the hell do you get that stuff?
- I know that you...

742
01:06:04,060 --> 01:06:05,186
You know, that...

743
01:06:05,261 --> 01:06:08,628
I'm no show-biz phony. I'm telling the truth.
Go on, man.

744
01:06:08,698 --> 01:06:09,824
You can't...

745
01:06:09,899 --> 01:06:13,357
- At least he's keeping up with Letterman.
- Pandering is more like it.

746
01:06:13,436 --> 01:06:17,930
You mean to tell me that other people
haven't contacted you for writing literary...

747
01:06:22,311 --> 01:06:24,973
- I mean...
- You could making a living as a writer.

748
01:06:25,047 --> 01:06:27,538
What are you trying to do over there?

749
01:06:28,117 --> 01:06:31,245
I'm trying to get some news.
There's a big story about to break...

750
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:34,551
about the US selling arms to Iran
and the Contras.

751
01:06:35,825 --> 01:06:38,293
- Just relax.
- Don't worry about it.

752
01:06:38,661 --> 01:06:40,856
Finally, something good. Watch this.

753
01:06:41,697 --> 01:06:44,257
- I got a job.
- I know you've got a job. I've got a job.

754
01:06:44,333 --> 01:06:48,167
- We're both very lucky. We both have jobs.
- Then what's the matter?

755
01:06:49,038 --> 01:06:51,404
- Joke, man.
- We gotta go.

756
01:06:51,474 --> 01:06:55,103
Harvey, I like you. I'm on your side.
I enjoy the comic books.

757
01:06:55,177 --> 01:06:58,112
- Quickly, tell us about the little doll.
- My wife made it.

758
01:07:01,751 --> 01:07:03,742
- Am I giving you a hard time?
- No.

759
01:07:03,819 --> 01:07:05,548
- Am I making you nervous?
- No.

760
01:07:05,621 --> 01:07:08,351
We have to go now.
I wanted to mention these are for sale.

761
01:07:08,424 --> 01:07:10,619
- They're made out of your old clothing.
- Right.

762
01:07:10,693 --> 01:07:13,719
- What do these go for?
- $34.

763
01:07:16,399 --> 01:07:19,527
- $34 for this?
- What are you, cheaper than me?

764
01:07:19,602 --> 01:07:23,766
- Would you pay $34 for that?
- No, but I'm not asking it. My wife is.

765
01:07:27,877 --> 01:07:29,845
Such brilliant repartee.

766
01:07:33,482 --> 01:07:34,471
Shit.

767
01:07:38,821 --> 01:07:40,686
So, what do you think?

768
01:07:44,326 --> 01:07:45,691
Megalomaniac.

769
01:07:48,130 --> 01:07:50,496
Hi, this is a message for Harvey Pekar.

770
01:07:58,774 --> 01:08:02,039
From the streets of Cleveland,
ladies and gentlemen, please welcome...

771
01:08:02,111 --> 01:08:05,877
the one, the only Harvey Pekar.
Harvey, come on out, buddy.

772
01:08:08,451 --> 01:08:13,013
It became clear pretty fast that
I was invited on the show just for laughs.

773
01:08:13,322 --> 01:08:16,382
You look like a lot of guys
you see sleeping on buses.

774
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:20,085
- Sorry.
- It's all right, Dave, have a good time.

775
01:08:20,162 --> 01:08:24,030
- I know, we're doing what we can.
- It's your world. I'm just living in it.

776
01:08:28,070 --> 01:08:29,970
But what the hell did I care?

777
01:08:30,573 --> 01:08:33,872
Letterman was an okay guy.
Let him take potshots at me.

778
01:08:33,943 --> 01:08:36,503
So long as I got paid
and got to plug my comics.

779
01:08:36,579 --> 01:08:40,743
I think to myself, you look like every
police artist sketch I've ever seen.

780
01:08:42,051 --> 01:08:43,109
Funny thing is...

781
01:08:43,185 --> 01:08:46,086
something about me and Letterman
clicked for the viewers.

782
01:08:46,155 --> 01:08:47,554
He kept wanting me back.

783
01:08:47,623 --> 01:08:50,888
- It was about a year ago, this month...
- That's right.

784
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:51,984
No, last month.

785
01:08:52,061 --> 01:08:55,224
A year ago, last month, you made
your first appearance on the show.

786
01:08:55,297 --> 01:08:58,494
- What has happened to you since?
- Not much, David.

787
01:08:59,068 --> 01:09:01,059
It's slow going. I still have the same job.

788
01:09:01,137 --> 01:09:04,538
But see, Harvey, you're the embodiment
of the American Dream.

789
01:09:05,808 --> 01:09:08,641
And it wasn't just me
getting all the attention.

790
01:09:08,711 --> 01:09:09,905
Action.

791
01:09:12,181 --> 01:09:13,705
Are these free?

792
01:09:14,884 --> 01:09:17,250
As a result of my appearances
on Letterman...

793
01:09:17,319 --> 01:09:21,449
my buddy Toby Radloff,
landed a gig extolling the virtues of MTV.

794
01:09:25,861 --> 01:09:27,852
Watch where you're going.

795
01:09:28,597 --> 01:09:32,431
- All right, you fucking yuppie freak.
- Who the fuck is this on my set?

796
01:09:36,238 --> 01:09:38,763
Look at this, the man of the hour.

797
01:09:41,277 --> 01:09:45,077
This is my new do for the MTV generation.

798
01:09:49,652 --> 01:09:53,144
We came upon Toby Radloff
while doing a story in Cleveland last year...

799
01:09:53,222 --> 01:09:55,588
on his friend, the comic artist Harvey Pekar.

800
01:09:55,658 --> 01:09:59,219
Toby's a genuine nerd, and he doesn't care
if you have a problem with that.

801
01:09:59,295 --> 01:10:03,493
Hi, my name is Toby Radloff,
a genuine nerd from Cleveland, Ohio.

802
01:10:03,566 --> 01:10:06,057
And as you know, many hip people...

803
01:10:06,135 --> 01:10:10,765
including a lot of college students,
are going to be heading for spring break.

804
01:10:11,240 --> 01:10:15,074
But I have decided
to spend my own personal spring break...

805
01:10:15,144 --> 01:10:18,238
right here in beautiful Cleveland, Ohio.

806
01:10:21,283 --> 01:10:23,410
That day, I had an epiphany.

807
01:10:23,986 --> 01:10:27,285
It seemed that real salt-of-the-earth people,
like Toby and me...

808
01:10:27,356 --> 01:10:30,519
were getting co-opted
by these huge corporations.

809
01:10:31,193 --> 01:10:34,594
We were getting held up and ridiculed
as losers in the system.

810
01:10:35,197 --> 01:10:38,894
This is Toby Radloff,
genuine spring-break party nerd...

811
01:10:38,968 --> 01:10:40,401
signing off.

812
01:10:42,037 --> 01:10:44,631
What can I say? It was the '80s, man.

813
01:10:46,976 --> 01:10:49,001
Harvey, are you listening to me?

814
01:10:49,111 --> 01:10:53,275
I've been reading about these kids
who grew up in these war zones.

815
01:10:53,349 --> 01:10:55,647
You know, Palestinians, Israelis...

816
01:10:57,119 --> 01:11:00,111
El Salvadorians, Cambodians.
These kids are amazing...

817
01:11:00,189 --> 01:11:03,283
You're that guy
from the Letterman show, right?

818
01:11:03,359 --> 01:11:04,883
Yeah, that's me.

819
01:11:05,227 --> 01:11:09,254
That's so excellent.
You and Stupid Pet Tricks are a riot.

820
01:11:10,799 --> 01:11:14,235
Yeah? Then how about
you buy one of my comics, man?

821
01:11:14,670 --> 01:11:17,195
That's the only reason
I go on that dumb show, anyway.

822
01:11:17,273 --> 01:11:20,674
Right. Sure. Later, Harvey Pekar.

823
01:11:22,044 --> 01:11:25,502
- What an asshole!
- I want to write a political comic book...

824
01:11:25,581 --> 01:11:27,208
about these kids.

825
01:11:29,118 --> 01:11:32,417
Listen to me. There's a conference
in Jerusalem in a couple of weeks.

826
01:11:32,488 --> 01:11:35,252
I'm gonna start
by doing some interviews there.

827
01:11:35,357 --> 01:11:38,349
Wait a minute.
What are you talking about, Jerusalem?

828
01:11:38,427 --> 01:11:42,887
Lately I can barely drag you off the futon
to go with me to the Letterman show.

829
01:11:43,932 --> 01:11:45,866
Do you want to know why?

830
01:11:46,402 --> 01:11:48,962
Because I don't give a damn
about the Letterman show.

831
01:11:49,038 --> 01:11:52,872
I want to do something important to me,
something that matters.

832
01:11:55,177 --> 01:11:58,374
You know I only go on the show
for the extra bread.

833
01:11:59,715 --> 01:12:03,048
Maybe if you got your lazy ass up,
and got yourself a job...

834
01:12:03,118 --> 01:12:05,484
I could do something that matters, too.

835
01:12:05,621 --> 01:12:08,590
- Harvey, you're yelling.
- You ever think of that?

836
01:12:19,501 --> 01:12:20,729
Don't...

837
01:12:25,374 --> 01:12:26,773
I'm sorry.

838
01:12:28,777 --> 01:12:30,301
Joyce, I'm sorry.

839
01:12:37,686 --> 01:12:41,713
I guess it was good to finally see
Joyce excited about something of her own.

840
01:12:41,790 --> 01:12:45,157
This is crazy. Can't you just
do something here in Cleveland?

841
01:12:45,294 --> 01:12:48,320
You'll survive a couple of weeks by yourself.

842
01:12:49,431 --> 01:12:50,625
All right.

843
01:12:54,937 --> 01:12:57,906
Be careful out there, all right? I love you.

844
01:13:01,543 --> 01:13:05,035
Sure, I was happy for her,
but I was still upset for me.

845
01:13:11,987 --> 01:13:14,888
It was later that night
when I first found the lump.

846
01:13:28,170 --> 01:13:31,628
I was determined to put it out of my mind
until Joyce got back.

847
01:13:33,675 --> 01:13:35,267
Easier said than done.

848
01:13:36,111 --> 01:13:38,102
What do I care? Just give me the chart.

849
01:13:38,180 --> 01:13:40,614
- What is your problem?
- Miguel, look...

850
01:13:40,682 --> 01:13:43,242
I just don't want to keep
coming back here for it, okay?

851
01:13:43,318 --> 01:13:46,219
Harvey, that patient's due to be admitted
a week from now.

852
01:13:46,288 --> 01:13:49,121
- Why do you always fight?
- How often must we go through this?

853
01:13:49,191 --> 01:13:51,284
Just give me the fucking chart!

854
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:54,227
- We'll see what the doctor has to say.
- Fine.

855
01:14:07,075 --> 01:14:08,440
What?

856
01:14:34,970 --> 01:14:37,268
What do you mean, another two weeks?

857
01:14:37,973 --> 01:14:40,908
Jesus Christ.
You've got to come home sometime!

858
01:14:46,248 --> 01:14:47,442
Hello?

859
01:14:48,116 --> 01:14:50,175
Goddamn it.

860
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:13,774
Just walk straight out to the desk.

861
01:15:13,842 --> 01:15:15,139
I know. Okay, fine.

862
01:15:15,210 --> 01:15:16,837
- You all set?
- Yeah.

863
01:15:18,847 --> 01:15:20,576
I was starting to lose it.

864
01:15:21,283 --> 01:15:26,186
Between the lump, the loneliness,
I felt like everything was closing in on me.

865
01:15:27,556 --> 01:15:30,252
And with Joyce over there
saving the world...

866
01:15:30,325 --> 01:15:33,556
I never felt more like a sell-out hack
in my life.

867
01:15:33,896 --> 01:15:35,227
Okay.

868
01:15:37,165 --> 01:15:41,158
You know, folks, if it really is true
that misery loves company...

869
01:15:41,270 --> 01:15:44,865
our next guest must always have
a house full of people.

870
01:15:45,607 --> 01:15:47,097
Okay, asshole.

871
01:15:48,310 --> 01:15:50,437
You're gonna pay for that one, man.

872
01:15:52,414 --> 01:15:55,872
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome back Harvey Pekar.

873
01:15:57,019 --> 01:16:00,284
Harvey, this is not the forum.
This is not Meet The Press.

874
01:16:00,355 --> 01:16:03,290
You just want me to talk about
simple-minded bullshit, David.

875
01:16:03,358 --> 01:16:06,623
- I ain't co-opted like you. I got things to say.
- Relax, Harvey.

876
01:16:06,695 --> 01:16:09,892
For instance, I want to talk about
a conflict of interest situation.

877
01:16:09,965 --> 01:16:11,956
Can we do that, David? How about that?

878
01:16:12,034 --> 01:16:15,162
You know,
like GE owning this network, NBC.

879
01:16:15,237 --> 01:16:19,333
GE has basically become
a military, industrial, financial...

880
01:16:19,408 --> 01:16:22,741
Can we get the singing shitzu back here?
Has he left the building yet?

881
01:16:22,811 --> 01:16:25,746
You think NBC news is gonna cover
what they do fairly?

882
01:16:25,814 --> 01:16:28,374
- I got other things I wanna talk about.
- That's enough...

883
01:16:28,450 --> 01:16:30,714
Just shut up, man! Don't push me.

884
01:16:30,786 --> 01:16:33,152
- I'm doing my own thing.
- Harvey, this is not...

885
01:16:33,221 --> 01:16:34,848
Are you afraid of the truth, David?

886
01:16:34,923 --> 01:16:38,552
It's not about what you're saying.
It's about your choice of venue.

887
01:16:38,627 --> 01:16:41,824
It may come as a shock to you,
but this is a comedy show.

888
01:16:41,897 --> 01:16:44,991
- Not tonight, it ain't.
- Joe, come check this out.

889
01:16:45,067 --> 01:16:47,797
Take your winning personality
and go get your own show.

890
01:16:47,869 --> 01:16:51,862
- I don't want my own goddamn show.
- We've had you on this show many times.

891
01:16:51,940 --> 01:16:54,636
You sulk, complain,
and promote your comic book...

892
01:16:54,710 --> 01:16:56,507
and you really haven't been appreciative.

893
01:16:56,578 --> 01:16:59,206
You didn't do me any favors, okay?

894
01:16:59,548 --> 01:17:03,314
I'm still a file clerk.
I've always been a file clerk...

895
01:17:03,385 --> 01:17:07,481
and it's no thanks to you
or to your goddamn pathetic audience.

896
01:17:09,992 --> 01:17:11,584
We're gonna take a commercial.

897
01:17:11,660 --> 01:17:14,060
And when we come back,
guess who's not gonna be here.

898
01:17:14,129 --> 01:17:17,394
You want me to leave, David?
Come on, ask me like a man.

899
01:17:17,466 --> 01:17:20,833
- Don't go hiding behind a commercial.
- Are things okay at home, Harvey?

900
01:17:20,902 --> 01:17:23,962
Things are just great at home.
Okay, goodbye, Dave.

901
01:17:24,039 --> 01:17:26,098
Goodbye, America, and thanks for nothing.

902
01:17:26,174 --> 01:17:28,768
Harvey Pekar, ladies and gentlemen.
We'll be right back.

903
01:17:35,550 --> 01:17:39,213
- I guess you really did it this time.
- Who the hell cares?

904
01:17:40,155 --> 01:17:42,953
That show wasn't helping my sales anyway.

905
01:17:47,295 --> 01:17:48,284
Baby...

906
01:17:49,398 --> 01:17:51,161
please don't go away anymore.

907
01:17:52,134 --> 01:17:54,432
I just can't take being alone, you know?

908
01:17:54,636 --> 01:17:58,003
If you met those kids over there,
you wouldn't ask that of me.

909
01:17:58,073 --> 01:17:59,597
I'm telling you something...

910
01:17:59,675 --> 01:18:02,576
if you go away again, I'm gonna lose it.

911
01:18:02,644 --> 01:18:06,171
This is not up for discussion.
I need this in my life right now.

912
01:18:14,222 --> 01:18:17,453
I do appreciate the fact
that you missed me so much, baby.

913
01:18:29,538 --> 01:18:31,062
Harvey, what is that?

914
01:18:32,407 --> 01:18:33,874
I don't understand.

915
01:18:34,776 --> 01:18:38,974
Does "tumor" mean the same thing
as "cancer"?

916
01:18:40,682 --> 01:18:42,707
We know the growth is malignant.

917
01:18:42,818 --> 01:18:45,412
What we don't know
is how far it may have spread.

918
01:18:45,487 --> 01:18:49,355
Once we have the results, we can make
informed decisions about treatment.

919
01:18:49,424 --> 01:18:51,153
Cancer.

920
01:18:51,226 --> 01:18:52,784
Diagnosis.

921
01:18:52,861 --> 01:18:54,453
MRI.

922
01:18:54,529 --> 01:18:56,326
Cancer.

923
01:18:59,501 --> 01:19:01,162
How can I have cancer?

924
01:19:03,538 --> 01:19:07,338
- I don't feel sick at all.
- That's a positive thing.

925
01:19:10,412 --> 01:19:12,607
My cousin Norman died of lymphoma.

926
01:19:15,350 --> 01:19:18,376
He was 29. He was a brilliant oncologist.

927
01:19:18,453 --> 01:19:21,650
Stop it! You're not gonna die, Harvey.
You're not.

928
01:19:22,958 --> 01:19:26,291
What's gonna happen to you, baby?
Who's gonna take care of you...

929
01:19:26,361 --> 01:19:27,919
Look at me and focus.

930
01:19:30,966 --> 01:19:32,991
We are gonna get through this.

931
01:19:33,535 --> 01:19:37,062
I understand illness.
I know how to handle these things.

932
01:19:37,139 --> 01:19:40,370
Yeah, but that's you, you know?

933
01:19:40,442 --> 01:19:43,707
I'm not strong enough.
I don't know how to be positive.

934
01:19:43,779 --> 01:19:45,679
I can't do that. I can't do it.

935
01:19:45,747 --> 01:19:48,079
- Yes, you can.
- No, I can't.

936
01:19:49,484 --> 01:19:50,883
I'll tell you how.

937
01:19:52,587 --> 01:19:55,317
You'll make a comic book
of the whole thing.

938
01:19:55,924 --> 01:19:58,119
You'll document every detail.

939
01:19:58,727 --> 01:20:03,528
And that way, you'll remove yourself
from the experience until it's over.

940
01:20:09,204 --> 01:20:12,867
I can't do that. I'm just not strong enough.

941
01:20:14,943 --> 01:20:16,604
Man, I just wanna die.

942
01:20:19,247 --> 01:20:21,442
That's fine. I'll do it without you.

943
01:21:08,730 --> 01:21:12,097
I'm Fred.
You called me about the comic book.

944
01:21:13,668 --> 01:21:15,727
Right, the artist. Come in.

945
01:21:20,876 --> 01:21:23,310
This is my daughter, Danielle.

946
01:21:24,613 --> 01:21:27,343
I had to bring her along.
I hope you don't mind.

947
01:21:30,151 --> 01:21:33,951
Hi, Danielle. What's that you're holding?

948
01:21:35,423 --> 01:21:36,754
A pony.

949
01:21:37,492 --> 01:21:39,892
A pony? What's his name?

950
01:21:41,830 --> 01:21:44,856
She's a girl. Clarissa.

951
01:21:45,500 --> 01:21:47,263
Oh, I see.

952
01:21:47,602 --> 01:21:52,505
I'm Joyce, and I'm very pleased
to meet both you and Clarissa.

953
01:21:53,141 --> 01:21:56,542
I'm real sorry to hear about Harvey.
Is he here?

954
01:21:56,611 --> 01:21:59,375
He's going to work till next week
when he starts the chemo.

955
01:21:59,447 --> 01:22:01,506
That's why I want this project started...

956
01:22:01,583 --> 01:22:04,916
because once he's stuck here,
I know he'll take over.

957
01:22:15,130 --> 01:22:16,256
Shit.

958
01:22:26,241 --> 01:22:27,731
Fucking idiot.

959
01:22:28,209 --> 01:22:31,576
Hey, Joyce, open the door.

960
01:22:32,714 --> 01:22:34,978
I forgot my keys again.

961
01:22:38,820 --> 01:22:40,082
Hold the door.

962
01:22:57,906 --> 01:23:00,500
Open the fucking door, man!

963
01:23:04,946 --> 01:23:08,040
- Hey, Harvey.
- Fred.

964
01:23:17,525 --> 01:23:19,049
What's going on, man?

965
01:23:22,364 --> 01:23:24,389
You see, I thought it was a great idea.

966
01:23:24,466 --> 01:23:28,061
Joyce said if we try to just follow you
through your treatments...

967
01:23:28,136 --> 01:23:30,696
She thought it was a good idea, too,
didn't she?

968
01:23:30,772 --> 01:23:34,469
Here's some of the ideas
we've been batting around.

969
01:23:36,077 --> 01:23:37,408
All right.

970
01:23:41,349 --> 01:23:42,543
Jesus.

971
01:23:45,286 --> 01:23:47,754
Joyce has no idea what she's doing, man.

972
01:23:48,223 --> 01:23:50,919
There's too many words in these frames.

973
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:54,024
When are you coming back, Fred?

974
01:23:55,663 --> 01:24:00,157
She said something about next Tuesday,
which is fine with me. It's just...

975
01:24:00,902 --> 01:24:04,429
The only thing is,
I might have the kid again.

976
01:24:05,140 --> 01:24:09,577
My ex-wife is supposed to take her, but
I don't have much faith in her showing up.

977
01:24:10,779 --> 01:24:13,543
She's in worse shape than me these days.

978
01:24:21,823 --> 01:24:23,256
Next week...

979
01:24:24,292 --> 01:24:26,055
my treatment begins.

980
01:24:29,431 --> 01:24:32,332
Do me a favor, man. Bring the kid, will you?

981
01:26:10,732 --> 01:26:12,165
Thanks.

982
01:26:26,748 --> 01:26:28,238
I wanna die.

983
01:27:12,026 --> 01:27:13,493
- Joyce.
- What?

984
01:27:13,962 --> 01:27:15,589
What's wrong, Harvey?

985
01:27:16,431 --> 01:27:19,662
What are you doing up? What is it?

986
01:27:21,769 --> 01:27:23,464
Tell me the truth.

987
01:27:26,941 --> 01:27:29,569
Am I a guy who writes about himself...

988
01:27:30,411 --> 01:27:32,003
in a comic book?

989
01:27:37,252 --> 01:27:39,652
Or am I just a character in that book?

990
01:27:39,988 --> 01:27:42,957
What are you talking about?
What are you saying?

991
01:27:44,459 --> 01:27:47,724
If I die, will that character keep going?

992
01:27:50,131 --> 01:27:52,156
Or will he just fade away?

993
01:28:00,141 --> 01:28:02,200
Oh, my God. Harvey, wake up.

994
01:28:02,910 --> 01:28:04,901
Wake up, Harvey. Come on.

995
01:28:07,715 --> 01:28:10,206
Oh, no. Come on, wake up.

996
01:28:12,153 --> 01:28:13,711
Can you hear me?

997
01:28:23,965 --> 01:28:25,956
My name is Harvey Pekar.

998
01:28:27,101 --> 01:28:30,229
That's an unusual name: Harvey Pekar.

999
01:28:34,575 --> 01:28:39,376
1960 was the year I got my first apartment
and my first phone book.

1000
01:28:40,548 --> 01:28:43,779
Now, imagine my surprise
when I looked up my name...

1001
01:28:44,285 --> 01:28:48,312
and saw that in addition to me,
another Harvey Pekar was listed.

1002
01:28:50,591 --> 01:28:54,357
You know, I was listed as Harvey L. Pekar.

1003
01:28:54,429 --> 01:28:56,329
My middle name is Lawrence.

1004
01:28:56,698 --> 01:28:59,826
He was listed as Harvey Pekar.

1005
01:29:01,836 --> 01:29:04,532
Therefore, his was a pure listing.

1006
01:29:07,909 --> 01:29:09,570
Then in the '70s...

1007
01:29:10,011 --> 01:29:14,243
I noticed that a third Harvey Pekar
was listed in the phone book.

1008
01:29:14,649 --> 01:29:17,914
Now, this filled me with curiosity.

1009
01:29:19,487 --> 01:29:22,854
How can there be three people
with such an unusual name in the world...

1010
01:29:22,924 --> 01:29:24,755
let alone in one city?

1011
01:29:27,729 --> 01:29:29,128
Then one day...

1012
01:29:30,164 --> 01:29:34,567
a person I work with
expressed her sympathy to me...

1013
01:29:34,869 --> 01:29:37,929
concerning what she thought
was the death of my father.

1014
01:29:39,140 --> 01:29:42,507
She pointed out an obituary notice
in the newspaper...

1015
01:29:42,577 --> 01:29:44,602
for a man named Harvey Pekar.

1016
01:29:45,780 --> 01:29:49,079
And one of his sons was named Harvey.

1017
01:29:52,720 --> 01:29:54,881
These were the other Harvey Pekars.

1018
01:30:00,228 --> 01:30:03,356
And six months later, Harvey Pekar, Jr. died.

1019
01:30:04,399 --> 01:30:06,560
Although I'd met neither man...

1020
01:30:08,236 --> 01:30:10,227
I was filled with sadness.

1021
01:30:12,440 --> 01:30:14,772
"What were they like?" I thought.

1022
01:30:16,377 --> 01:30:20,473
It seemed our lives had been linked
in some indefinable way.

1023
01:30:22,617 --> 01:30:24,881
But the story does not end there.

1024
01:30:26,454 --> 01:30:31,323
For two years later, another Harvey Pekar
appeared in the phone book.

1025
01:30:34,829 --> 01:30:36,421
Who are these people?

1026
01:30:38,733 --> 01:30:40,598
Where do they come from?

1027
01:30:41,736 --> 01:30:43,328
What do they do?

1028
01:30:46,974 --> 01:30:48,498
What's in a name?

1029
01:30:51,813 --> 01:30:53,440
Who is Harvey Pekar?

1030
01:31:14,268 --> 01:31:17,101
We've got T-shirts for sale upstairs,
if you're interested.

1031
01:31:18,639 --> 01:31:20,766
Here's our man, a year later.

1032
01:31:22,343 --> 01:31:26,746
Somehow I made it through the treatments,
and the doctors are optimistic.

1033
01:31:27,815 --> 01:31:30,511
I guess Joyce was right
about doing a big comic book.

1034
01:31:31,686 --> 01:31:35,747
We published the thing as a graphic novel,
our first collaboration...

1035
01:31:36,190 --> 01:31:38,454
and ended up with rave reviews.

1036
01:31:39,160 --> 01:31:42,027
We even won
a couple of National Book Awards.

1037
01:31:42,763 --> 01:31:44,094
Go figure.

1038
01:31:45,666 --> 01:31:47,258
Those are beautiful.

1039
01:31:47,335 --> 01:31:51,101
Did you find this in there?
I didn't even see those.

1040
01:31:52,273 --> 01:31:54,764
Ever seen one of these flowers?

1041
01:31:54,842 --> 01:31:56,241
Are you finished?

1042
01:31:57,478 --> 01:32:00,470
Danielle, I love it. Very expressive colors.

1043
01:32:07,221 --> 01:32:08,950
What is it, Harvey?

1044
01:32:10,458 --> 01:32:11,982
That was the doctor.

1045
01:32:17,865 --> 01:32:19,730
He says I'm all clear.

1046
01:32:46,994 --> 01:32:50,452
The weirdest thing
that came out of my illness was Danielle.

1047
01:32:53,568 --> 01:32:56,696
With her real mother running around
who knows where...

1048
01:32:56,771 --> 01:32:59,604
and seeing how well her and Joyce got on...

1049
01:33:00,508 --> 01:33:03,477
Fred decided
she'd have a better life with us.

1050
01:33:13,487 --> 01:33:17,480
I was scared at first, but then I thought,
what the hell. She's a good kid.

1051
01:33:17,558 --> 01:33:18,786
Hi, Harvey.

1052
01:33:20,394 --> 01:33:23,795
So we ended up taking her
and raising her as our own.

1053
01:33:31,672 --> 01:33:35,733
- You keep reading them backwards.
- I like reading them backwards.

1054
01:33:36,644 --> 01:33:38,009
Is that one you?

1055
01:33:38,579 --> 01:33:41,343
I keep telling you, all of them's me, man.

1056
01:33:42,783 --> 01:33:44,580
You look like a monster.

1057
01:33:46,988 --> 01:33:49,582
Wait till you see
what you're gonna look like.

1058
01:33:49,657 --> 01:33:52,717
- Me?
- Yeah, you're part of the story, too, now.

1059
01:33:53,394 --> 01:33:54,554
What story?

1060
01:33:55,997 --> 01:33:57,658
The story of my life.

1061
01:34:00,534 --> 01:34:04,994
I know I'm not as interesting as The Little
Mermaid and all that magical crap...

1062
01:34:05,072 --> 01:34:07,540
I think I'm gonna write my own comic.

1063
01:34:08,209 --> 01:34:10,769
- Yeah? What about?
- I'm not sure yet.

1064
01:34:11,278 --> 01:34:13,178
But not about you.

1065
01:34:13,981 --> 01:34:16,575
I think you have enough already.

1066
01:34:25,626 --> 01:34:28,823
You should write about
things in your own life.

1067
01:34:29,497 --> 01:34:31,556
You know, like school...

1068
01:34:33,768 --> 01:34:36,703
and ponies. I don't know. Girl stuff.

1069
01:34:38,706 --> 01:34:40,867
Do you have to hold my hand?

1070
01:34:42,176 --> 01:34:44,474
What are you, embarrassed of me?

1071
01:34:45,813 --> 01:34:49,305
I know, I'm embarrassing.
I felt the same way about my father.

1072
01:34:49,817 --> 01:34:53,810
No. It's just, when you hold my hand,
you squeeze it too hard.

1073
01:34:56,290 --> 01:34:57,416
Go on.

1074
01:34:59,794 --> 01:35:02,729
Joyce is right.
You are obsessive-compulsive.

1075
01:35:03,831 --> 01:35:04,991
Go on.

1076
01:35:27,855 --> 01:35:30,756
Yeah, so I guess comics brought me to life.

1077
01:35:32,326 --> 01:35:35,124
But don't think
this is some sunny, happy ending.

1078
01:35:35,463 --> 01:35:37,988
Every day is still a major struggle.

1079
01:35:38,432 --> 01:35:41,959
Joyce and I fight like crazy.
And she barely works.

1080
01:35:42,636 --> 01:35:45,366
The kid's got ADD and is a real handful.

1081
01:35:46,006 --> 01:35:47,906
My life is total chaos.

1082
01:35:58,652 --> 01:36:03,453
With a little luck, I'll get a window
of good health between retiring and dying.

1083
01:36:04,158 --> 01:36:07,821
The golden years, right? Who knows?

1084
01:36:08,395 --> 01:36:12,297
Between my pension
and the chunk of change I get for this film...

1085
01:36:12,466 --> 01:36:14,934
I should be able to swing something.

1086
01:36:18,405 --> 01:36:20,896
Sure, I'll lose the war eventually.

1087
01:36:20,975 --> 01:36:25,469
But the goal is to win a few skirmishes
along the way, right?

1088
01:36:29,683 --> 01:36:31,378
Surprise!

1089
01:36:31,752 --> 01:36:36,416
For he's a jolly good fellow

1090
01:36:37,124 --> 01:36:39,684
Which nobody can deny

1091
01:36:40,561 --> 01:36:41,789
Surprise.
