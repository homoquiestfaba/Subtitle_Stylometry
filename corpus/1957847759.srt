1
00:00:20,005 --> 00:00:21,813
You want the legend of the Blair Witch.

2
00:00:21,843 --> 00:00:25,334
The legend of the Blair Witch is long and involved,

3
00:00:25,364 --> 00:00:30,578
and in my opinion it's mostly
just stories to scare children.

4
00:00:32,174 --> 00:00:35,038
Startedback in the 1700,

5
00:00:35,068 --> 00:00:41,090
the stories began circulating supposedly as
i understand about a witch in the area.

6
00:00:35,376 --> 00:00:39,583
{\an8}Chris Carrazzo
film archivist

7
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:45,194
Some old woman that was cursing
people that was doing things.

8
00:00:45,224 --> 00:00:49,267
I don't know all that but she
became the witch of the area,

9
00:00:49,297 --> 00:00:52,213
as I understand she might even have
been put to death over it.

10
00:00:52,243 --> 00:00:56,078
Years progressed from there every bad
thing that happened to the town

11
00:00:56,108 --> 00:01:00,233
it was the Blair Witch, causing people
just have to find something to tag,

12
00:01:00,263 --> 00:01:04,727
someone to label as the cause of things
the Blair Witch became that,

13
00:01:04,757 --> 00:01:06,522
for this area for Birkedsville.

14
00:01:06,552 --> 00:01:09,750
Quite some time again after
that a child drowned in a river,

15
00:01:10,185 --> 00:01:12,900
and people attributed that to the Blair Witch,

16
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:15,620
which there's absolutely nothing to substantiate that.

17
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:17,950
So I understand it, was a shallow part of the river,

18
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:22,378
but there were laims supposedly that
the child was seen being pulled down

19
00:01:22,408 --> 00:01:26,769
by a hand in the river. The fact is
there's a for sure drowning in shallow water.

20
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:29,813
I mean, i know people have
drowned in soup bowls,

21
00:01:30,294 --> 00:01:34,232
so you can't tell me that eight
inches of water is not too shallow

22
00:01:34,262 --> 00:01:35,830
for someone to drown in.

23
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:37,629
A child did go missing,

24
00:01:37,659 --> 00:01:41,199
after the child drowned and a young boy i believe,

25
00:01:41,635 --> 00:01:44,417
search party went out looking for the young boy,

26
00:01:44,867 --> 00:01:48,566
young boy was recovered, the
search party never came back.

27
00:01:48,596 --> 00:01:51,236
So they sent out a search party for the search party,

28
00:01:51,621 --> 00:01:54,850
and they came across the
bodies found on Coffin Rock,

29
00:01:54,984 --> 00:02:00,604
right by the river and every member of
the search party was dead.

30
00:02:00,634 --> 00:02:02,515
They were not just dead.

31
00:02:02,545 --> 00:02:05,392
They were mutilated, they were hacked to pieces.

32
00:02:05,422 --> 00:02:08,605
I'm not denying that that ever
happened that's a fact that happened,

33
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:11,029
but it got attributed to the Blair Witch,

34
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:13,566
and i don't see how that happened.

35
00:02:13,596 --> 00:02:18,230
There was the Ruston Parri incident which
became attributed to the Blair Witch,

36
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:20,739
in some way or another,
because Ruston Parr

37
00:02:20,769 --> 00:02:24,610
claimed that he did what he did
because an old woman told him.

38
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,554
To the old witch it's been said in different ways.

39
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:30,783
The most recent incident that we've had happen,

40
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:34,095
is these three college kids,

41
00:02:34,363 --> 00:02:38,665
went out into the woods in the Burkinsville area.

42
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:42,464
They were going to make themselves a
documentary concerning the Blair Witch,

43
00:02:43,034 --> 00:02:47,179
and they went missing and they were assumed dead,

44
00:02:47,602 --> 00:02:51,669
and then some time later their equipment was found.

45
00:02:52,201 --> 00:02:57,676
They pieced together the material found, there are a
lot of videotapes and film reels and stuff.

46
00:02:57,987 --> 00:03:01,105
And they managed to pieces together,
and what they think implies

47
00:03:01,135 --> 00:03:04,021
that the Blair Witch attacked them and killed them.

48
00:03:04,384 --> 00:03:09,926
This is just, really this is absolutely
more of the urban legend,

49
00:03:09,956 --> 00:03:12,524
being built up these kids aren't missing.

50
00:03:12,554 --> 00:03:15,227
They aren't dead, this is just a sick joke.

51
00:03:15,257 --> 00:03:20,132
It's the kind of stuff that sad sick people
perform on these kind of events.

52
00:03:20,372 --> 00:03:22,417
That's the blair Witch legend.

53
00:03:34,777 --> 00:03:39,481
The Burkittsville 7

54
00:03:39,951 --> 00:03:41,528
How long have you been in here?

55
00:03:43,406 --> 00:03:44,833
How long have you been in here?

56
00:03:45,187 --> 00:03:47,028
He was a boogeyman for the area.

57
00:03:47,058 --> 00:03:50,117
We were always told, don't do that.
Rustin Par is going to get you.

58
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:52,934
Go to sleep and be quiet or
Rustin Parr is going to get you.

59
00:03:53,173 --> 00:03:58,554
Well, this is my collection of cameras,
predominantly super 816 millimeter here.

60
00:03:58,584 --> 00:04:00,981
This is the camera that I got from my parents, though.

61
00:04:01,011 --> 00:04:02,540
Used to have a viewfinder on it.

62
00:04:02,934 --> 00:04:07,131
I kind of was just attracted to the odd angles in here.

63
00:04:07,161 --> 00:04:10,155
I think they had a gun. And part of the
roof is just a nice flat roof.

64
00:04:10,185 --> 00:04:12,051
And you come into another area
where the bedroom is,

65
00:04:12,081 --> 00:04:15,089
and it's a peaked roof, basically,
i've been working in film all my life,

66
00:04:15,119 --> 00:04:17,253
a projector that I've used for years.

67
00:04:17,283 --> 00:04:20,739
Not in Hollywood, not making it as a filmmaker.

68
00:04:21,105 --> 00:04:26,457
yeah, I have some stuff that
probably has not seen too many eyes.

69
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:32,316
Let's see.
Okay, we got it.

70
00:04:32,346 --> 00:04:33,846
We got it right here.

71
00:04:38,123 --> 00:04:39,419
This is...

72
00:04:41,696 --> 00:04:44,419
my Rustin Parr treasure box.

73
00:04:44,593 --> 00:04:46,612
Well, initially, it wasn't just Rustin parr,

74
00:04:46,642 --> 00:04:50,621
I just kind of always had
a fascination with serial killers.

75
00:04:50,651 --> 00:04:54,703
Convicted Murderer Ruston Parr
executed for Burkett'sville killings,

76
00:04:54,957 --> 00:04:59,361
Transcripts from the trial.
Here's Rustin giving his testimony.

77
00:04:59,391 --> 00:05:02,577
That was just one of the few times
i had someone like that,

78
00:05:02,691 --> 00:05:07,320
a serial killer of that repute that
was like in my own backyard,

79
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:10,691
that i could possibly find something out myself.

80
00:05:11,033 --> 00:05:12,724
Why did you do it, mister Parr?

81
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:16,150
I heard voices in my head.

82
00:05:28,941 --> 00:05:33,795
I'm Bill Barnes, executive director of
Burkittsville Historical Society,

83
00:05:33,825 --> 00:05:35,711
and the Historian of Burkketsville.

84
00:05:36,232 --> 00:05:41,011
It's my responsibility there to teach
the children the history of our area,

85
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:44,373
because we're at close to three larger towns:

86
00:05:44,403 --> 00:05:48,565
Rockville, Baltimore, and Washington, DC.

87
00:05:48,595 --> 00:05:50,711
Which are all fairly historical,

88
00:05:50,741 --> 00:05:55,687
but I don't want to lose touch with the fact that
we have a pretty good historical town too.

89
00:05:56,448 --> 00:06:00,147
Let's go back, say, to the fall of 1940.

90
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:02,678
The birth of a small town,

91
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:05,865
Everybody knew everybody, usually
most of them by their first name.

92
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:08,124
{\an8}Emily Hollands
abducted 13 november 1940

93
00:06:06,537 --> 00:06:09,109
But we've had some kids disappearing in town.

94
00:06:09,139 --> 00:06:11,511
They were mostly between the age of six and eight.

95
00:06:09,502 --> 00:06:12,272
{\an8}Kyle Brody
abducted 5 december 1940

96
00:06:12,302 --> 00:06:15,020
It went long after that Mr.
Parr came into town,

97
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:16,102
{\an8}Terra Shelly
abducted january 8 1941

98
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:19,220
and walked to Mr. Smith or Mr.
Striker's store, I don't know which one.

99
00:06:17,868 --> 00:06:20,619
{\an8}Steven Thompson
abducted february 20 1941

100
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:22,971
One of the general stores who titled, who
was telling the story as to where he went.

101
00:06:21,243 --> 00:06:23,731
{\an8}Michael Guldry
abducted march 5 1941

102
00:06:23,404 --> 00:06:30,343
But he come in and he said, the words that become
famous in Burkettville is that "I finally finished."

103
00:06:25,005 --> 00:06:27,803
{\an8}Eric Norris
abducted march 13 1941

104
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,681
{\an8}Julie Forsyth
abducted april 2 1941

105
00:06:31,711 --> 00:06:34,385
Well, they didn't know what he
meant, and they asked him.

106
00:06:32,601 --> 00:06:35,512
{\an8}Margaret Lowell
abducted may 20 1941

107
00:06:35,146 --> 00:06:37,146
He said, I've killed those children.

108
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:51,383
He was charged and convicted with
the abduction of eight children,

109
00:06:51,773 --> 00:06:54,806
and the murder of seven children in that area.

110
00:06:59,337 --> 00:07:03,384
Ruston was basically, up until that point,

111
00:07:03,534 --> 00:07:05,731
he was a pretty harmless guy.

112
00:07:05,872 --> 00:07:07,741
He was friendly.
He was nice.

113
00:07:08,459 --> 00:07:11,778
All of a sudden, he became this monster,
the demon of burkittsville,

114
00:07:11,808 --> 00:07:13,637
as they referred to him at times.

115
00:07:20,772 --> 00:07:24,321
I don't think anybody ever thoroughly
looked at the story.

116
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:26,763
People just assumed things about Rustin Parr.

117
00:07:26,899 --> 00:07:29,180
They decided that certain things were this way,

118
00:07:29,363 --> 00:07:32,030
and they never did a thorough investigation.

119
00:07:32,161 --> 00:07:35,307
Rustin's mother and father, they died around the 30s.

120
00:07:35,804 --> 00:07:37,908
At That time already Rustin was...

121
00:07:35,851 --> 00:07:41,100
{\an8}Leonard Torrington
Rustin Parr Relative

122
00:07:38,265 --> 00:07:41,034
Rustin was living out in the back woods.

123
00:07:41,443 --> 00:07:43,462
He was very uncomfortable in society,

124
00:07:43,598 --> 00:07:45,588
society was very uncomfortable with him.

125
00:07:45,757 --> 00:07:49,457
{\an8}Dominic Cazale
Former Priest

126
00:07:46,105 --> 00:07:49,513
When he was arrested for killing
seven children in Burkettville,

127
00:07:49,543 --> 00:07:52,994
I was serving that prison, I heard his confession,

128
00:07:53,172 --> 00:07:59,172
which I have kept as a private valve
for what, 50 years now?

129
00:07:59,571 --> 00:08:04,791
Just like all the other sort of tales to
scare children, that kind of thing.

130
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:10,696
Ruston had this reputation, just like the
old scary house in the neighborhood,

131
00:08:10,726 --> 00:08:12,414
where people say, you know:

132
00:08:12,596 --> 00:08:16,456
who everlives there, if you go near the house,
they'll put a curse on you, or something like that.

133
00:08:20,441 --> 00:08:22,113
That's what the voices told me.

134
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,699
I'm finally finished.

135
00:08:24,512 --> 00:08:27,066
Those were the words that are attributed to him.

136
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:32,431
I have asked around to anyone who
might have been a survivor of that time.

137
00:08:32,461 --> 00:08:37,746
I can't find anybody who's willing to say they
know that Ruston Parr said those words.

138
00:08:37,776 --> 00:08:39,080
I'm finally finished.

139
00:08:39,389 --> 00:08:41,343
He said, I'm finally finished.

140
00:08:42,184 --> 00:08:44,822
And that was his acceptance of death.

141
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:47,883
I think it had nothing to do with the crime,
Everybody said, oh,

142
00:08:48,545 --> 00:08:50,874
but I don't think it had
anything to do with the crime.

143
00:08:50,904 --> 00:08:53,926
So they got the sheriff come down
and he arrested him.

144
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:58,470
And he went up to the cabin and sure
enough he found seven bodies.

145
00:08:58,775 --> 00:09:00,616
Not eight. That's was seven.

146
00:09:00,868 --> 00:09:04,175
And the 8th one that they didn't find, was Kyle Brody.

147
00:09:04,316 --> 00:09:09,780
While they were looking for the bodies in
the home and uncovering those bodies,

148
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:13,752
kyle Brody comes walking back
into the town of Burkettville,

149
00:09:14,675 --> 00:09:18,675
and he starts telling people about Rustin Parr,

150
00:09:18,705 --> 00:09:21,144
and what Ruston Parr has been doing for the last year.

151
00:09:21,174 --> 00:09:23,862
How Rustin Parr held him captive there in his home,

152
00:09:23,892 --> 00:09:27,527
how Ruston Parr was committing these horrible,
unspeakable acts to these children.

153
00:09:27,557 --> 00:09:31,351
But he came back in town.
He testified against him at the trial.

154
00:09:31,731 --> 00:09:37,518
You know, I do I do not know
why they took me to that trial.

155
00:09:37,548 --> 00:09:42,262
I mean, what were they thinking
taking a child my age

156
00:09:38,065 --> 00:09:41,905
{\an8}Janine Brody
Kyle Brody Sister

157
00:09:42,292 --> 00:09:46,720
to hear someone testify about killings and murders?

158
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:49,096
And there were all these people.
They were all around.

159
00:09:49,126 --> 00:09:52,269
I just remember there were so many people
all around and they were staring at Kyle.

160
00:09:52,598 --> 00:09:54,448
I remember angry voices.

161
00:09:55,242 --> 00:10:02,228
I remember a tall man with glasses shouting and pointing
at someone who I think was Rustin Parr.

162
00:10:02,909 --> 00:10:06,346
And I remember, I guess it was the judge banging.

163
00:10:06,376 --> 00:10:14,359
And I remember Kyle sitting in this big box just staring
straight ahead, not looking at anyone.

164
00:10:15,049 --> 00:10:20,364
And those eyes are just looking straight ahead
and answering these questions.

165
00:10:20,837 --> 00:10:24,621
He begins telling everyone what
happened to him overthis time,

166
00:10:24,651 --> 00:10:29,720
that he's been locked into Rustin Parr's home,
into one of the rooms in the upstairs.

167
00:10:30,053 --> 00:10:33,931
And periodically he would be
brought out by Rustin Parr.

168
00:10:34,161 --> 00:10:38,377
And then, according to Kyle Brody,
Rustin Parr would face him into a corner,

169
00:10:38,489 --> 00:10:42,217
while Rustin Parr then performed
these atrocities on these children.

170
00:10:42,982 --> 00:10:47,330
I just remember Kyle's face all white and
pale and his eyes all blue gray,

171
00:10:47,493 --> 00:10:50,075
and almost as though he didn't want
to see what he had seen.

172
00:10:50,105 --> 00:10:52,113
He didn't want to say what he was about to say.

173
00:10:52,143 --> 00:10:54,244
He didn't want to know what he had come to know.

174
00:10:54,274 --> 00:10:57,742
He had details about Emily Holland's abduction.

175
00:10:57,888 --> 00:11:03,812
Emily Holland was abducted an entire two weeks
before the Kyle Brody went missing.

176
00:11:04,425 --> 00:11:07,880
And yet he knows events about the abduction,

177
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,603
about where Parr found her in the woods,

178
00:11:10,633 --> 00:11:13,157
and abducted her and brought
her back to his place.

179
00:11:13,187 --> 00:11:18,216
And justice being real swift, they took him
down in Rockville behind the jail,

180
00:11:18,329 --> 00:11:20,254
where the galas was and hung him.

181
00:11:20,444 --> 00:11:25,336
He seemed to get some pleasure from telling
them the stories they wanted to hear.

182
00:11:28,676 --> 00:11:30,366
They would have hung him anyway.

183
00:11:30,396 --> 00:11:34,260
I think that the decision was made
that Rustin Parr was guilty,

184
00:11:34,392 --> 00:11:38,359
before anybody had a chance to even look at the facts.

185
00:11:38,389 --> 00:11:43,331
It was all decided as they were marching
up the hills to Rustin Parr's home.

186
00:11:43,571 --> 00:11:47,325
And then with the boy coming in at
the same time and laying out his story.

187
00:11:47,542 --> 00:11:51,150
By the time they came back with what they
were looking at as conclusive evidence,

188
00:11:51,944 --> 00:11:53,285
it was done.

189
00:11:54,002 --> 00:12:00,605
Here's one on a young Parr's
victim put in institution living.

190
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:03,728
Parr's victim leading difficult life.

191
00:12:04,505 --> 00:12:07,398
Poor Kyle's suffering.
There's Kyle Brody.

192
00:12:08,415 --> 00:12:10,639
One of his many trips before the law.

193
00:12:15,731 --> 00:12:18,044
We had a boy there in town named Kyle Brody.

194
00:12:18,323 --> 00:12:20,335
A weird sort of kid.

195
00:12:21,173 --> 00:12:25,017
And being like he was, some of the
things he'd like to do is,

196
00:12:25,272 --> 00:12:27,954
he'd like to catch cats and
stuff them in a mailbox.

197
00:12:28,222 --> 00:12:31,887
Kyle Brody when we first saw him,

198
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:38,632
I determined almost immediately that
he belonged away from society.

199
00:12:38,662 --> 00:12:40,554
He belonged in the mental institution.

200
00:12:40,584 --> 00:12:44,085
He was obviously mentally ill.

201
00:12:40,744 --> 00:12:44,688
{\an8}Dr. Alvin Frasier
Psichologyst

202
00:12:44,282 --> 00:12:48,150
I remember I used to see him outside
playing by the stream all the time.

203
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:50,888
The classic tearing wings off a flies.
That's nothing.

204
00:12:50,918 --> 00:12:54,526
But he would also take the frogs out of the river.

205
00:12:54,794 --> 00:12:58,324
He'd capture them, and he would
chop the legs off of the frogs.

206
00:12:58,354 --> 00:12:59,855
He wouldn't kill the frogs first.

207
00:12:59,885 --> 00:13:04,352
And so apparently Kyle came home that
day and filled one of his buckets with frogs.

208
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:07,695
And he began cutting off the
legs of one of these frogs.

209
00:13:07,926 --> 00:13:12,686
So eventually all four legs were chopped
off and there was just this horrible,

210
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:16,043
painful creature writhing on the ground.

211
00:13:16,578 --> 00:13:18,465
My mother said, what are you doing?

212
00:13:18,724 --> 00:13:23,484
And he said, I'm trying to see
if frogs have feelings.

213
00:13:24,573 --> 00:13:26,414
Children who've been abused.

214
00:13:26,444 --> 00:13:29,292
They sometimes take things out
on small animals or insects.

215
00:13:30,186 --> 00:13:33,585
He said that's the first sign of
a psychological disturbance in a child.

216
00:13:33,895 --> 00:13:39,528
He believed that he was severely physically
beaten as a child by his father.

217
00:13:39,738 --> 00:13:45,691
My feeling is that this was probably not so.

218
00:13:46,169 --> 00:13:47,925
All I can tell you is he believed it.

219
00:13:48,282 --> 00:13:51,512
my father wanted Kyle to be a man.

220
00:13:51,799 --> 00:13:54,822
And he disciplined him very harshly at times.

221
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,153
With schizophrenic personality,

222
00:13:57,183 --> 00:14:00,527
there is no way to substantiate
what they're saying is true or not.

223
00:14:00,557 --> 00:14:04,610
Unless, of course, you have another
family member who will corroborate it.

224
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,231
In this case, we did not.

225
00:14:06,261 --> 00:14:10,633
There's history of the boy being a problem child,
a very difficult child to deal with.

226
00:14:10,895 --> 00:14:14,661
When he disappeared, the parents
thought he had run away,

227
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:18,442
so they were rather surprised when he came
back with his story of being abducted.

228
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:22,934
Rustin Parr abducted eight children.
One of them was my brother.

229
00:14:23,733 --> 00:14:26,291
Seven of those children were butchered by that man.

230
00:14:27,174 --> 00:14:33,040
My brother was forced to stand facing a wall
while other children were killed behind him.

231
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:36,091
He could hear the sounds,
he could hear them screaming,

232
00:14:36,121 --> 00:14:38,443
not knowing what was going to happen next.

233
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:44,874
What is the reasoning behind having a child face
a corner for all this, just is just illogical.

234
00:14:44,904 --> 00:14:47,365
And this man butchered these seven children.

235
00:14:47,395 --> 00:14:49,689
How Kyle ever got away, I have no idea.

236
00:14:50,019 --> 00:14:53,684
I think, in my opinion, from some
of the facts that I've gathered,

237
00:14:53,714 --> 00:14:56,422
from some of the experiences
i've had in my life as well,

238
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,768
that what might have happened actually,

239
00:14:58,902 --> 00:15:04,076
was that Kyle Brody had actually
planned this from the beginning.

240
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:07,585
Kyle was a beautiful child, though
perhaps this man fancied him.

241
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:10,200
Perhaps he thought he could
get sexual favors from Kyle.

242
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:13,664
Perhaps Kyle may even have provided
those to save his own life.

243
00:15:13,694 --> 00:15:15,004
I don't know.

244
00:15:15,034 --> 00:15:18,351
And then to turn around and say that
my brother killed those children.

245
00:15:18,636 --> 00:15:20,334
Those children were his friends.

246
00:15:21,099 --> 00:15:22,898
The seven children that died,

247
00:15:23,239 --> 00:15:27,675
none of these children knew each one of
the other children that were missing.

248
00:15:28,173 --> 00:15:30,955
The only person out of the entire group,

249
00:15:31,145 --> 00:15:35,312
that did know all eight of the children
abducted was Kyle Brodie.

250
00:15:35,731 --> 00:15:38,525
But he liked to fight. He'd always
fight with the other kids,

251
00:15:39,301 --> 00:15:42,396
and he didn't care how big he was.
He'd dump on and fight with them.

252
00:15:42,426 --> 00:15:45,072
He had past histories with them,
some of them troubled pastors.

253
00:15:45,102 --> 00:15:48,260
Some records, not records,

254
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:50,439
but knowledge from the people I've talked to

255
00:15:50,469 --> 00:15:54,070
of there being disturbances between
Kyle and some of the other kids.

256
00:15:54,195 --> 00:15:57,156
One day he tried to pick a fight with me,

257
00:15:57,324 --> 00:15:59,424
but I never thought nothing about fighting.

258
00:15:59,454 --> 00:16:02,899
Kyle Brody was involved with
the abduction of Emily Hollins.

259
00:16:02,929 --> 00:16:05,585
Hence he knows all these facts and details about it.

260
00:16:05,615 --> 00:16:08,558
Rustin Parr never threatened anyone in any way.

261
00:16:08,588 --> 00:16:13,577
He was a peaceful person, and I just don't believe
that he had it in him to perform these acts,

262
00:16:13,607 --> 00:16:16,962
these atrocious acts that were done to these children.

263
00:16:17,085 --> 00:16:21,185
This kid had it in him to develop these ideas,
these schemes, these plans.

264
00:16:21,215 --> 00:16:25,645
And I think that he is the one who led
Rustin Parr through every one of these things.

265
00:16:25,675 --> 00:16:29,209
I don't think he stood there with his
face facing a corner during all this.

266
00:16:29,239 --> 00:16:32,173
I think he was there taking Rustin Parr's hand,

267
00:16:32,203 --> 00:16:34,441
putting the knife in it and having him do this,

268
00:16:34,471 --> 00:16:38,481
because he wouldn't need someone with the
strength of an adult to do some of these acts.

269
00:16:38,725 --> 00:16:41,675
But he was the one that was making the decisions,

270
00:16:41,705 --> 00:16:44,245
and he was the one guiding Rustin parr through this.

271
00:16:52,695 --> 00:16:54,762
I met Cal Brody in the late 60s,

272
00:16:54,941 --> 00:17:01,723
I was assigned to the psychiatric ward of the
Maryland State Institute for the Criminally Insane.

273
00:17:03,786 --> 00:17:07,943
I heard about him before I got there
because he was quite infamous,

274
00:17:08,077 --> 00:17:12,010
and his case made quite a number of newspapers.

275
00:17:13,731 --> 00:17:18,043
The state of the mental institutions
when Kyle Brody was first incarcerated,

276
00:17:18,073 --> 00:17:22,300
of course, is nowhere near as
humane as they are now.

277
00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:27,455
He was a legendary dark figure in the hospital.

278
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:37,899
It was this last incarcerated link to this heinous
multiple murder that had taken place in 1940.

279
00:17:37,929 --> 00:17:43,245
Kyle Brody's pharmacological
chart was all over the place.

280
00:17:43,275 --> 00:17:45,926
When I first met him.
They tried everything,

281
00:17:44,082 --> 00:17:49,800
probably known to man,
and nothing was working.

282
00:17:46,089 --> 00:17:51,408
{\an8}Dr. David Hull    Dr. Harlan Miles
Co-case worker Kyle Brody

283
00:17:50,312 --> 00:17:52,368
And I read that and I said, this has got to stop.

284
00:17:53,086 --> 00:17:58,157
He had apparently been taking the medication
that had reduced him to Catatonia.

285
00:17:58,593 --> 00:18:00,190
And on the first day,

286
00:18:00,765 --> 00:18:05,832
They thought that the medication
itself had created the catatonia,

287
00:18:05,862 --> 00:18:08,133
or had created the climate for catatomic.

288
00:18:08,163 --> 00:18:10,144
I mean, just like rigid like that.

289
00:18:10,174 --> 00:18:16,075
I narrowed it down to two or three medications
that I felt we could zero in on.

290
00:18:16,209 --> 00:18:19,304
What would be the outcome
that we wouldn't looking for?

291
00:18:20,342 --> 00:18:22,073
I discussed it

292
00:18:24,476 --> 00:18:29,727
with Dr.Miles, and we decided to narrow it
down even more, which we did.

293
00:18:29,757 --> 00:18:36,064
I mean, these medications are so potent,
the side effects are unspeakable.

294
00:18:36,094 --> 00:18:38,500
And I remember him laying in his bed, rigid,

295
00:18:38,707 --> 00:18:42,684
and i remember looking down at
him and he couldn't speak.

296
00:18:42,809 --> 00:18:47,122
The medication I had originally
suggested, he finally agreed.

297
00:18:47,152 --> 00:18:50,753
Yes, we both agreed.
Let's try that. We did it.

298
00:18:50,904 --> 00:18:52,881
And there were some noticeable changes.

299
00:18:53,343 --> 00:18:58,740
Then I noticed he had changed.
He was back again.

300
00:18:59,128 --> 00:19:09,262
And I found out later that Dr.Hall had switched
the medication without consulting them.

301
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:12,749
And I remember looking down at the sheets,

302
00:19:12,779 --> 00:19:14,973
and I remember seeing that the sheets were wet,

303
00:19:15,163 --> 00:19:16,671
and they were sweat.

304
00:19:17,488 --> 00:19:22,303
And I was so upset, I called the orderly
and I said, you've got to change him.

305
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:25,030
And the orderly I get this.

306
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:30,683
The orderly said, we want to teach
him to go to the bathroom on his own.

307
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:33,901
We're dealing with human beings, not just patients.

308
00:19:34,638 --> 00:19:37,879
I would imagine that those that work there,

309
00:19:37,909 --> 00:19:45,382
particularly in subsidiary positions such
as guards andinterns and orderlies,

310
00:19:47,413 --> 00:19:54,195
can probably get carried away and
perhaps get into abuse of the patients.

311
00:19:54,871 --> 00:19:58,804
I told mom and dad and I said we had
to get him out of there, but they couldn't.

312
00:19:58,834 --> 00:20:00,177
I couldn't afford to.

313
00:20:00,207 --> 00:20:05,149
Kyle Brody's sister, I guess you could say,

314
00:20:05,179 --> 00:20:11,491
was one of the many thorns in the side of
a system that was already full of thorns.

315
00:20:12,703 --> 00:20:16,222
She was convinced the Kyle that
her brother was not insane,

316
00:20:17,215 --> 00:20:22,232
and did everything to the best of her ability
to keep him out of mental institution.

317
00:20:22,713 --> 00:20:28,947
Kyle Brody I'm not going to say that he had an
easy existence after the Rustin Parr trial,

318
00:20:29,383 --> 00:20:32,243
but certainly I think it's better than being hung,

319
00:20:32,273 --> 00:20:35,450
But he became a rather aggressive panhandler,

320
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:39,522
where it wasn't really an option for people
to walk away and not give him something.

321
00:20:39,552 --> 00:20:42,259
He also had incidents of shoplifting.

322
00:20:42,289 --> 00:20:48,796
He has robberies, not armed robberies,
but very violent, aggressive.

323
00:20:48,826 --> 00:20:53,355
So he tended to spend most of his time in
a couple of different institutions,

324
00:20:53,385 --> 00:20:57,137
and that's actually where he died as well.

325
00:21:05,659 --> 00:21:07,357
I'm not seeing anything.

326
00:21:07,387 --> 00:21:13,480
I have nothing to base my opinions
of the adult Kyle Brody on,

327
00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:16,829
until I hear about this film called "White Enamel".

328
00:21:21,835 --> 00:21:25,483
I don't call them documentaries.
I don't like the term documentary very much.

329
00:21:26,683 --> 00:21:30,873
It conjures up something stale
and boring to most people,

330
00:21:31,275 --> 00:21:33,253
so I call them nonfiction films.

331
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:34,716
{\an8}David Hooper
White Enamel Filmmaker

332
00:21:33,895 --> 00:21:36,476
White Enamel was a documentary,

333
00:21:36,506 --> 00:21:40,632
a black and white documentary
shot back in the 60s in

334
00:21:41,338 --> 00:21:45,494
various, in insane asylums in Maryland.

335
00:21:45,863 --> 00:21:49,623
They tend to center on one in particular which,

336
00:21:49,946 --> 00:21:56,046
wonder of wonders is the very same institution
that Kyle Brody spent a great deal of time at.

337
00:21:59,099 --> 00:22:03,602
I think I expected a certain thing when
i went in into the hospital there,

338
00:22:03,836 --> 00:22:07,233
andit was completely different than I thought.

339
00:22:08,903 --> 00:22:11,194
And I took a deep breath
and I jumped off the cliff.

340
00:22:11,224 --> 00:22:13,665
I let it happen as it was happening.

341
00:22:14,536 --> 00:22:18,358
Nixon, I should give you not.
I could be a general.

342
00:22:18,929 --> 00:22:20,683
I mean, yeah, I could, but no.

343
00:22:20,713 --> 00:22:23,700
Nixon and Kissinger, they don't want
to share no war at all.

344
00:22:23,879 --> 00:22:25,700
My father was in World War II.

345
00:22:26,125 --> 00:22:28,549
He was a gunners made on the USS Idaho.

346
00:22:28,835 --> 00:22:32,724
And I'm here because of Richard Milhous Nixon.

347
00:22:32,947 --> 00:22:35,238
And Mr. Kissinger.
I am here.

348
00:22:35,819 --> 00:22:38,456
They're hearing right now what I'm saying.
They don't fool me.

349
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:40,334
They're hearing what I'm saying.

350
00:22:41,082 --> 00:22:44,021
The mere man was bugging. Yeah.
Just not looking at a meal.

351
00:22:44,051 --> 00:22:45,842
He's bugging this whole place.

352
00:22:48,881 --> 00:22:53,887
David Hooper, I think when he made
the film, he was almost an innocent,

353
00:22:55,152 --> 00:22:59,342
and i think he was also heroic in a way.

354
00:23:00,302 --> 00:23:03,990
It's a heroic act to take on this kind of inhumanity.

355
00:23:04,345 --> 00:23:08,881
I doubt very highly that most people
know they're doing anheroic act,

356
00:23:08,911 --> 00:23:11,328
when they're in the middle of doing it.
It's just

357
00:23:11,358 --> 00:23:13,764
something propels you into this.

358
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:18,121
And you either have the balls
to follow it through or you don't.

359
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:19,658
And he did.

360
00:23:19,825 --> 00:23:21,501
How long have you been in here?

361
00:23:23,224 --> 00:23:24,934
How long have you been in here?

362
00:23:25,247 --> 00:23:28,275
I've been here a long time.

363
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:35,196
Why are you in here?

364
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:43,621
I don't know why, they should they told me.

365
00:23:43,895 --> 00:23:47,750
I asked David Hooper about that, how
he made the decision to do that.

366
00:23:48,526 --> 00:23:50,526
I knew he thought it was powerful.

367
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:54,185
He had no idea how powerful it was going to be,

368
00:23:54,215 --> 00:23:59,732
but he knew he had to say
something about how humankind

369
00:23:59,762 --> 00:24:01,889
in general can treat the unwanted,

370
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:04,704
and how this culture is a beautiful culture,

371
00:24:04,734 --> 00:24:06,889
and doesn't tolerate what's ugly.

372
00:24:07,375 --> 00:24:09,956
So that as this

373
00:24:11,286 --> 00:24:14,861
frame after frame after frame starts to stack up,

374
00:24:15,402 --> 00:24:18,464
at first you think, man, I just don't want to watch this.

375
00:24:18,494 --> 00:24:20,464
It's too tedious to be on words of this.

376
00:24:21,056 --> 00:24:23,067
And then all of a sudden you go,

377
00:24:23,748 --> 00:24:25,637
this would be very hard to live with.

378
00:24:26,764 --> 00:24:29,312
This would be a very difficult job to have.

379
00:24:29,502 --> 00:24:31,111
Who gets this job?

380
00:24:31,141 --> 00:24:32,787
Who wants this job?

381
00:24:33,163 --> 00:24:36,928
What are the families of the people
who treat these people this way?

382
00:24:37,861 --> 00:24:45,504
Whose dad shoves a tube down some guy's nose
and pours lunch into their stomach?

383
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:55,355
And what's the kid like that lives in that family?

384
00:24:55,757 --> 00:24:58,550
How far out do the ripples of this go?

385
00:24:58,768 --> 00:25:02,321
And all of a sudden questions are being asked
without you even knowing them.

386
00:25:02,351 --> 00:25:05,433
Because there is no linear context to this film,

387
00:25:05,463 --> 00:25:08,076
because it doesn't have a
beginning, middle, and an end.

388
00:25:08,106 --> 00:25:10,919
It has a beginning, middle, and end at all times.

389
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:16,280
So it is a life force that's coming at you.

390
00:25:16,548 --> 00:25:18,056
Not a tidy picture.

391
00:25:32,943 --> 00:25:38,206
White enamel is well, it is
a very exciting point for me.

392
00:25:38,507 --> 00:25:42,027
I get to look at this thing, and it's mind blowing.

393
00:25:42,518 --> 00:25:47,378
I mean, the film itself is an interesting film as
far as the information you can glean from it as,

394
00:25:47,408 --> 00:25:51,009
to how inmates are treated in insane
asylum, that's interesting, but

395
00:25:51,289 --> 00:25:53,277
I'm not really that interested in that.

396
00:25:53,399 --> 00:26:00,348
There is actually about five minutes worth of footage,
approximately, of Kyle Brody as an adult.

397
00:26:00,516 --> 00:26:03,432
There is a scene of Kyle Brody in his cell,

398
00:26:03,885 --> 00:26:05,628
and he's chanting something.

399
00:26:07,464 --> 00:26:12,168
What he's chanting is the phrase, a two word phrase.

400
00:26:12,425 --> 00:26:14,134
Never given.

401
00:26:15,397 --> 00:26:17,576
Never given.

402
00:26:18,766 --> 00:26:20,620
Never given.

403
00:26:57,133 --> 00:27:00,452
Never given.

404
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:04,474
He's chanting that and what this means.

405
00:27:04,504 --> 00:27:10,825
The importance to this is there's actually 
reported fact from the guards

406
00:27:10,855 --> 00:27:17,115
that watched over Rustin Parr on a suicide 
watch while he was waiting to be killed.

407
00:27:17,145 --> 00:27:23,511
They have reports of Rustin Parr 
screaming the words never given.

408
00:27:23,541 --> 00:27:25,913
The same two words "never given".

409
00:27:26,601 --> 00:27:28,746
To say Kyle Brody creeped me out.

410
00:27:29,059 --> 00:27:31,036
I'd be putting it mildly. Kyle Brody,

411
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:34,640
was every nightmare you've 
ever had as a kid.

412
00:27:34,941 --> 00:27:38,126
That guy played with my head.

413
00:27:38,759 --> 00:27:41,463
Everything I asked him to do, 
he would do the opposite.

414
00:27:43,742 --> 00:27:46,860
I don't know what the phrase means, "never given".

415
00:27:47,106 --> 00:27:49,106
But here is another connection.

416
00:27:49,418 --> 00:27:53,485
Rustin Parr is chanting never given 
or screaming, yelling never given.

417
00:27:53,609 --> 00:27:58,302
Kyle Brody is chanting it in his cell.
So I didn't stop there.

418
00:27:58,461 --> 00:28:05,299
I know enough about filmmaking to know that if you 
have less than five minutes of Kyle Brody in your film,

419
00:28:05,569 --> 00:28:11,860
there could probably be another, maybe an hour's worth of 
footage of Kyle Brody that was never put into the film.

420
00:28:12,195 --> 00:28:16,809
Filmmakers overshoot.
So I began to look for David Hooper.

421
00:28:16,839 --> 00:28:20,306
He was very forthcoming with information.
He did remember Kyle Brody.

422
00:28:20,336 --> 00:28:23,139
Kyle Brody made it quite an impression on him in the film.

423
00:28:23,169 --> 00:28:25,362
He's a very intense figure.

424
00:28:26,104 --> 00:28:30,238
And then he told me that he 
had other footage of Kyle Brody.

425
00:28:30,618 --> 00:28:35,758
Chris is a maniac. And I recognize 
myself at the same age.

426
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:41,825
It takes brass balls to do some 
of the stuff that he's doing.

427
00:28:42,039 --> 00:28:46,218
I begged, I pleaded, I joeled, 
I bribed everything I could.

428
00:28:46,248 --> 00:28:50,665
And he was willing to send me 
the extra footage that he had.

429
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:52,771
This stuff was a mess.

430
00:28:52,801 --> 00:28:56,218
I did everything I could to restore this 
before Ieven began to look at it,

431
00:28:56,248 --> 00:28:59,739
built it up into the best shape 
i could watch this stuff.

432
00:29:00,365 --> 00:29:03,080
And there i found another very interesting key.

433
00:29:04,292 --> 00:29:08,404
There was a shot in the rec room of this insane asylum.

434
00:29:08,583 --> 00:29:13,007
And Kyle Brody is there with this large art notepad, 

435
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,245
and he's writing on the notepad.

436
00:29:15,636 --> 00:29:20,474
And what is being written on that notepad 
being written from right to left.

437
00:29:20,504 --> 00:29:24,617
The way it is supposed to 
be written is transitus fluviate.

438
00:29:24,647 --> 00:29:27,376
The language, the witchcraft language.

439
00:29:27,406 --> 00:29:30,639
This is not a common language.
It's not known all around the world.

440
00:29:30,669 --> 00:29:34,611
Very few people know this.
And here is Kyle Brody.

441
00:29:34,641 --> 00:29:38,362
To the best of my knowledge that that is 
what he's writing in his transit is fluviate.

442
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:42,720
I took this footage and I took whatever
stills I could grab from it,

443
00:29:42,983 --> 00:29:46,805
and try to find people who could substantiate this.

444
00:29:47,042 --> 00:29:50,304
Chris Carrasco found me through my website,

445
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:52,946
and he sent me an email and it said,

446
00:29:51,209 --> 00:29:55,410
{\an8}Sarah Didonna
photo analyst

447
00:29:52,976 --> 00:29:55,080
I have this piece of footage from the late 60's,

448
00:29:55,128 --> 00:29:57,813
and I needyou to analyze it and take a look at it.

449
00:29:58,358 --> 00:30:04,104
He wanted me to figure out and analyze 
what this particular gentleman was drawn.

450
00:30:04,134 --> 00:30:05,910
And he was convinced that I could do it.

451
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:11,065
And I was equally convinced that there was no 
way that you could conclusively say

452
00:30:11,095 --> 00:30:13,272
what this individual was drawn.

453
00:30:13,302 --> 00:30:19,395
She got some improvements, but she could 
not verify for sure from what she found

454
00:30:19,618 --> 00:30:22,989
that it was what I was hoping, the .

455
00:30:23,219 --> 00:30:30,534
I found another woman at Kendra Fineman,
who actually is relatively fluent in this.

456transit of Fluvia
00:30:30,564 --> 00:30:33,599
Chris brought that to me and asked if 
i could tell him what that was.

457
00:30:33,767 --> 00:30:39,682
So after examining that footage, we determined that this 
gentleman actually was writing in transit of Fluvia.

458
00:30:33,814 --> 00:30:37,119
{\an8}Kendra Fineman
Philosophy professor

459
00:30:39,762 --> 00:30:43,151
You can see very clearly the little
circle embellishments at the end,

460
00:30:43,181 --> 00:30:44,944
the little loops at the end of the letters.

461
00:30:44,974 --> 00:30:51,841
And she looked at this, and she fairly quickly was able 
to decide that this was transit as Fluviae.

462
00:30:51,871 --> 00:30:57,941
That language was mostly really used in secret 
societies and cults and different sects,

463
00:30:57,971 --> 00:31:02,922
and with witches that lived and practiced in Europe.

464
00:31:03,048 --> 00:31:07,659
This is what Kyle Brody is writing from right to left,

465
00:31:07,689 --> 00:31:11,039
the way transit from Fluviae is written, as if,

466
00:31:11,069 --> 00:31:13,232
as in the Hebrew language.

467
00:31:13,262 --> 00:31:16,067
They're saying that there are occult in alphabet,

468
00:31:16,545 --> 00:31:20,394
or they can tell what they're writing 
because that's what they want to believe.

469
00:31:20,424 --> 00:31:23,803
That's their theory. And so that's 
what they're bearing out.

470
00:31:24,028 --> 00:31:25,981
I saw him writing.
I saw how he was writing.

471
00:31:26,011 --> 00:31:32,365
And I, based on my own knowledge on the language, 
could decipher those characters.

472
00:31:32,395 --> 00:31:36,705
Cannot start the theory and then 
look for it in the photograph,

473
00:31:36,735 --> 00:31:41,381
have to take the photograph or the 
piece of film as aseparate entity,

474
00:31:41,508 --> 00:31:44,005
analyze it on its merits alone.

475
00:31:44,794 --> 00:31:48,043
Then if there's some correspondence
with the theorem, then great.

476
00:31:48,073 --> 00:31:50,893
But if there isn't, you need to let it go.

477
00:31:51,089 --> 00:31:57,164
Now, this is the exact same language that we find 
on the walls of the upstairs of Rustin Parr's home.

478
00:31:57,194 --> 00:32:03,305
Transit is Fluvi, written by this kid who has a high IQ,

479
00:32:03,335 --> 00:32:07,164
and might have somehow picked this 
up at some stage in his life,

480
00:32:07,328 --> 00:32:10,427
as compared to the possibility of Rustin Parr,

481
00:32:10,457 --> 00:32:16,316
a man who was illiterate, could not 
read or write at all in English.

482
00:32:16,507 --> 00:32:23,108
The idea of him writing transit, his Fluvia language 
all over the walls of his home, it's absurd.

483
00:32:23,702 --> 00:32:30,697
This is a very important key piece of evidence that I've 
found that I think links Kyle Brody to these murders.

484
00:32:31,785 --> 00:32:34,442
And it's not really being considered that seriously.

485
00:32:34,949 --> 00:32:37,991
As I was pouring over the ideas of the Rustin Parr case,

486
00:32:38,021 --> 00:32:42,254
and thinking about Rustin, who is 
a rather simple fellow. Actually.

487
00:32:42,284 --> 00:32:45,212
A simpleton. And this child,

488
00:32:45,242 --> 00:32:49,624
This magnetic, charming child of Kyle Brody.

489
00:32:49,654 --> 00:32:52,920
Who I think has manipulated Rustin Parr.

490
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:54,911
Made him do his bidding.

491
00:32:54,941 --> 00:32:57,872
If not actually holding his hand and leading him to it.

492
00:32:57,902 --> 00:33:02,567
Directing him still through every action 
through the abduction of Emily Hollins.

493
00:33:02,597 --> 00:33:06,264
Which Kyle Brody should not have 
known anything about. But he did.

494
00:33:06,564 --> 00:33:10,996
To all the actions of each of the deaths 
within the basement of that house.

495
00:33:11,026 --> 00:33:14,443
I think it was Kyle Brody leading him through this.

496
00:33:14,734 --> 00:33:19,607
Now, this story of what happened in Rustin Parr's 
cabin is being told by an unreliable witness,

497
00:33:19,637 --> 00:33:23,130
who is insane, who is also 
the person, in my opinion,

498
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:25,937
responsible for every one of the murderers.

499
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:29,566
These are things that once you 
start putting them together,

500
00:33:29,596 --> 00:33:31,444
once you start thinking of all the facts,

501
00:33:31,672 --> 00:33:35,784
it'll shape your beliefs and 
everything that you know so far.

502
00:33:38,872 --> 00:33:41,492
One short time ago, there was a guy from Ohio,

503
00:33:42,318 --> 00:33:45,210
started researching the death of those seven children.

504
00:33:46,072 --> 00:33:49,218
And he came up with a theory that 
nobody else had ever come up with.

505
00:33:49,753 --> 00:33:53,302
That Mr.Parr did not kill those children.

506
00:33:53,923 --> 00:33:55,951
That Kyle Brody was actually a murderer.

507
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:59,951
Rustin Parr was tired of living 
in the way he was living.

508
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:03,783
But I guess I've told you something 
of what he told me in confession.

509
00:34:03,896 --> 00:34:06,131
But he told me that he had killed no one.

510
00:34:06,253 --> 00:34:10,366
Not just me. He told his God 
that he had killed no one.

511
00:34:11,071 --> 00:34:14,283
And I asked him, I said, let me 
go to the judge for this story,

512
00:34:14,313 --> 00:34:15,757
let me tell the people.

513
00:34:16,292 --> 00:34:18,837
And he said, no, this is my confession.

514
00:34:19,658 --> 00:34:22,719
You have no right to take it anywhere.

515
00:34:23,751 --> 00:34:28,417
Kyle Brody is caught up in a situation that no
twelve year old should ever have to live through.

516
00:34:28,701 --> 00:34:35,509
And I think that's what triggered some deep seated 
illnesses that manifested itself later in life.

517
00:34:35,539 --> 00:34:38,213
I think he lived in a world of his own.

518
00:34:40,185 --> 00:34:42,851
who can say what goes on inside a person's head?

519
00:34:42,881 --> 00:34:45,574
But perhaps that world got to be too much for him.

520
00:34:45,725 --> 00:34:48,401
Kyle Brody he wasn't much older 
than the kid that kept killed.

521
00:34:48,431 --> 00:34:51,445
He was a kid himself. 
He was mean. That's true.

522
00:34:51,821 --> 00:34:54,600
I don't think he'd ever had 
to stomach to kill those kids.

523
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:57,051
Searching for the truth is not an easy thing.

524
00:34:57,370 --> 00:35:00,037
It's not something that most people want to face.

525
00:35:01,195 --> 00:35:04,848
I have generally found that once people 
set their mindson what has happened,

526
00:35:05,157 --> 00:35:07,787
if you start offering them any sort of alternate idea,

527
00:35:07,817 --> 00:35:12,404
especially if it's something that really goes against 
this happy world that they've set up forthemselves,

528
00:35:12,789 --> 00:35:15,484
you become hated for it.

529
00:35:15,808 --> 00:35:20,437
Chris Carasco is a blooming fucking idiot.

530
00:35:21,833 --> 00:35:27,786
He's just some bozo who is trying to 
drum up publicity for himself,

531
00:35:28,064 --> 00:35:33,379
with his preposterous hypothesis about 
a very inflammatory subject, anyway.

532
00:35:34,111 --> 00:35:37,247
I've talked to people that i 
could that might have known Kyle.

533
00:35:37,277 --> 00:35:38,945
People that would talk to me.

534
00:35:38,975 --> 00:35:42,006
His sister won't have anything to do with
me after she found out my ankle.

535
00:35:42,036 --> 00:35:43,959
Janine Brody has just closed herself up,

536
00:35:43,989 --> 00:35:46,419
but i think she hasn't information 
that would be very handy.

537
00:35:46,449 --> 00:35:48,837
I would love to talk to her in an open, free way.

538
00:35:49,039 --> 00:35:52,306
I guess I would like to see 
Chris Carrasco and just deck him.

539
00:35:56,273 --> 00:35:58,996
You can make what you want of it.
I don't tell you that,

540
00:35:59,026 --> 00:36:00,712
This is absolutely what happened that.

541
00:36:00,742 --> 00:36:03,409
This is the only way it could happen, 
that this is God's honest truth.

542
00:36:03,638 --> 00:36:08,295
I'm not saying that. All I'm offering 
you is my viewpoint on it.

543
00:36:08,605 --> 00:36:12,586
Do I think Kyle Brody is a killer?
Could be.

544
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:18,238
Kyle is simply was simply incapable 
of doing violence to someone.

545
00:36:18,698 --> 00:36:21,487
I mean, finally he did violence for himself.

546
00:36:22,303 --> 00:36:25,636
I've looked at everything with an open mind.
I did not set myself on anything,

547
00:36:25,666 --> 00:36:27,655
and I've gotten every fact I could.

548
00:36:31,441 --> 00:36:33,798
And then i put them together into a hypothesis.

549
00:36:33,995 --> 00:36:36,802
Now, you tell me anyone else that does it, 
you introduce them to me,

550
00:36:36,832 --> 00:36:40,028
you show me their material material,
and then I'll be happy to change my opinion.

551
00:36:40,058 --> 00:36:41,775
Nobody else has done the work I've done.

552
00:36:41,805 --> 00:36:43,709
You're welcome to go off and 
think whatever you want.

553
00:36:43,739 --> 00:36:45,268
I'm not telling you what to think, 

554
00:36:45,298 --> 00:36:48,199
but this is what I've come to 
and this is a conclusion that i found.

555
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:49,795
That's it. 

556
00:36:53,124 --> 00:36:58,786
I do take them out and i do, 
as I said, experimental pieces.

557
00:36:58,927 --> 00:37:03,655
I'm not so much into storytelling 
now as capturing imagery.

558
00:37:03,685 --> 00:37:05,693
Some of it may be a little on the disturbing side.

559
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:08,923
Here's Rustin being hung on the gallows.

560
00:37:09,139 --> 00:37:10,388
Nice close up.

561
00:37:10,562 --> 00:37:13,895
Basically, I go out and I will capture images,

562
00:37:14,618 --> 00:37:17,050
and occasionally annoy the hell out of people.

563
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,149
These are my babies.

564
00:37:18,179 --> 00:37:24,551
This is an actual copy of the newsreel footage 
announcing Rustin Parr's execution,

565
00:37:24,815 --> 00:37:28,336
and going overthe testimony, 
the court case as well.

566
00:37:28,366 --> 00:37:30,918
This was extremely difficult to come across.

567
00:37:32,895 --> 00:37:36,312
I have never felt that I've gone overboard on this.

568
00:37:37,524 --> 00:37:41,589
And once you start looking into this and 
getting a glimmer of what's going on here,

569
00:37:41,619 --> 00:37:44,997
I findit really hard to turn myself away.

570
00:37:45,027 --> 00:37:49,692
And it amazes me that these other people 
don't want to find out more about this.

571
00:37:49,722 --> 00:37:52,049
He's creating pain for these parents,

572
00:37:59,304 --> 00:38:02,553
he's taking my brother's name 
and fame, to put it mildly.

573
00:38:02,583 --> 00:38:06,309
I can be touched by someone walking down the street,

574
00:38:06,339 --> 00:38:10,991
to know one of those fabulous geeky guys 
with penholders in their pockets,

575
00:38:11,021 --> 00:38:15,226
and too many wallets and lumpy 
pockets, and then you go,

576
00:38:15,896 --> 00:38:18,629
oh, my God, they have the cards just to be who they are.

577
00:38:19,229 --> 00:38:26,092
And then I think of that guy standing 
in the corner, and it isn't voluntary.

578
00:38:27,173 --> 00:38:30,300
He is that naked guy standing in the corner.

579
00:38:30,704 --> 00:38:36,150
It's a human tendency to let sleeping 
dogs lie, but his instincts are right.

580
00:38:37,617 --> 00:38:38,978
It takes one to no one.

581
00:38:39,008 --> 00:38:43,100
And this guy has a reason and a 
need for finding this stuff out.

582
00:38:43,373 --> 00:38:45,448
And if I can help him, I'm happy to do it.

583
00:38:45,615 --> 00:38:49,981
I have gone to Burkittsville trying to 
open up information on this,

584
00:38:50,011 --> 00:38:53,502
trying to get newideas, trying to 
interview some people.

585
00:38:53,636 --> 00:38:54,998
They're not interested.

586
00:38:55,028 --> 00:38:57,233
It took quite some time to get 
some people to open up at all.

587
00:38:57,263 --> 00:38:58,885
Some people never will.

588
00:38:58,915 --> 00:39:02,021
Basically, you're trying to burst everyone's illusions,

589
00:39:02,187 --> 00:39:05,107
and people don't take kindly to that.

590
00:39:05,305 --> 00:39:07,342
But if you care about what you're doing,

591
00:39:07,372 --> 00:39:09,915
if you believe in what you're 
doing if you think you have 

592
00:39:09,945 --> 00:39:12,028
a shred of the truth in your hands,

593
00:39:12,145 --> 00:39:13,657
you want to fill the hand up.

594
00:39:13,687 --> 00:39:16,512
You just want to get more, 
you need more information,

595
00:39:16,681 --> 00:39:20,239
you need to find more and you hope to get 
the truth out in the light of day.
