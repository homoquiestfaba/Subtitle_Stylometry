Mark: Caitlyn,
this is a process, okay?

3
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:32,490
But it's important
for you to remember

4
00:00:32,491 --> 00:00:37,078
that the only person
who can save us is ourselves.

5
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:38,788
Caitlyn:
He's a monster.

6
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:40,831
A goddamn fucking monster.

7
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:42,750
That's what he is.

(Heavy, shuddering breaths)

9
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:46,629
But I can't seem
to get away from him.

10
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:50,007
Do you remember what drew you
to Mitch in the first place?

11
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:52,261
We met at work, and...

12
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:59,476
He was charming and mysterious.

13
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:04,814
He wined and dined me
and took me traveling,

14
00:01:04,815 --> 00:01:06,399
and...

15
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,611
He told me it was me and him
against the world.

16
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,031
He made me feel important.

17
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:15,449
Renfield:
Hello.

My name is

all these decent folks,

20
00:01:20,247 --> 00:01:23,082
I am in

Renfield: When I met him,
I was a real estate lawyer

30
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:51,319
hoping to make a deal
that would change my life

31

and my family's lives forever.

32
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:54,697
Oh, and it most certainly did.

33
00:01:54,698 --> 00:01:59,785
You will make a very good
assistant, Mr. Renfield.

34
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:02,371
Renfield:
I understand how Caitlyn feels.

35
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:04,665
I never drink wine.

36
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:06,500
Renfield:
He also wined and dined me.

37
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:08,169
He made me feel important.

38
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:12,006
He introduced me
into high society.

39
00:02:12,007 --> 00:02:13,800
- We went to the theater.

40

41

And then he made me
his familiar.

42
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:25,228
Which means that I take care
of master's every need.

43

Including staff changes

44
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:30,149

46
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:35,404

The bugs. This comes up a lot.

54
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:51,504
Dracula's powers come from
consuming human life.

55
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:53,297
Mine come from eating bugs.

The moment I'm gone,

71
00:03:40,804 --> 00:03:44,516

I am your only salvation.

00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:56,903
I am your only friend.

I am the only one

From now on, every drop of blood
Dracula spills

86

No.

91
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:08,015
Yeah.

92
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:09,975
This is a fairly typical result.

93
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:12,311
At the peak of his powers,
Dracula goes on

94
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,355
a full-tilt
blood-sucking bender,

95
00:05:14,356 --> 00:05:16,982
the good guys show up
and do their thing,

96
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:19,693
and then it's up to me
to clean up the mess.

97
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:23,239
-(Thunder rumbling) -It's what
I call our transitional period.

98
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,909
So I take him to a new city,
nurse him back to full power,

99
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:29,078
find a decent place
to ride it out

100
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:32,289
until the whole cycle starts
all over again.

101
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:33,999
Uh, excuse me. H-Hi.

102
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,627
May I borrow a pen, please?

103
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:38,713
Thank... you.

104
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:43,259
Which brings us back here.

105
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:46,679
In the meantime, I come here
and listen to these poor souls

106
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,056
talk about their monsters.

107
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:50,849
You were just talking
about Mitch, what...

108
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:54,353
I know this is, like,
way down the list of bad stuff,

109
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:57,022
but he's also really into ska.

110
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:59,483
- The kind of music?
- Yes.

111
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:02,695
Fishbone, mustard plug,
voodoo glow skulls.

112
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:04,614
I fucking hate that shit!

113
00:06:06,575 --> 00:06:08,075
I'm so sorry, Caitlyn. I'm so...

114
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:10,661
- Mark, I am... I'm so sorry.
- Mark: It's okay.

115
00:06:10,662 --> 00:06:13,372
Is that the one
that's 99% horns?

116
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:14,665
Yeah, see,
that's what I was thinking.

117
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:16,792
No.
That's a huge oversimplification

118
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:19,461
of ska's innovative contribution
to music.

119
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:21,755
(Crying):
Oh, my god, who am I?

120
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:23,340
(Coughing)

121
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:25,594
- Renfield?
- Hmm?

122
00:06:26,595 --> 00:06:29,848
Sorry, no, I swallowed a bug.

123
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:32,891
Unintentionally.

124
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:34,435
What-what other way
is there to...

125
00:06:34,436 --> 00:06:36,021
Would you like
to share your story?

126
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:39,898
No. Thank-thank you.
I don't think you'd understand.

127
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:42,651
I know it's scary.

128
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:45,946
And you think things
are never gonna change,

129
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:48,324
but I promise you,
one day you're gonna realize

130
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:50,577
that you can have
the life that you want.

131
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:55,122
But in the meantime, I just hope

132
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:57,792
that you get something
out of coming here.

133
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:02,963
I am.

134
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:04,923
That's great.

135
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:07,134
Renfield:
Oh, yes, I'm getting something

136
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:09,386
out of coming here: Victims.

137
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:10,888
But not these victims.

138
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:12,556
Mark:
Let's do our affirmations.

139
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:14,099

Group:
I am enough, and I have enough.

141
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:19,521
I deserve happiness.

142
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:21,732
I am grateful for all that I am,

143
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:24,526
and I take full charge
of my life today.

144
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:26,028
Renfield:
They can repeat these

145
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:27,905
- affirmations all they want.
- (Applause)

146
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:30,742
It'll never make
their problems go away.

147
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:33,786
But I can.

148
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:36,288
Now, no one's ever gonna
call me a hero,

149
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:39,583
but I've come up with
a mutually beneficial solution

150
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:41,710
for people like Caitlyn:

151
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:47,050
Get rid of their monsters
by giving mine what he needs.

152
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:50,552
("The same everyday"
by the slackers playing)

153
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:53,305
Hey, Doug. What are you doing
over there, buddy?

154
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:54,848
There's somebody
out there, Mitch.

155
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:57,017
Oh, my god, there's no one
out there, Doug!

156
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:59,311
Bro, do you think
the lobo family is gonna

157
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:00,437
let us get away with this?

158
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:02,356
We stole
their fucking drugs, man.

159
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:04,358
I don't want to hear it, Doug!

160
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:06,235
(Music stops)

161
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:07,319
Goddamn it.

162
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,320
- What the fuck?
- Oh, fuck.

163
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:09,530
That was the best part.

164
00:08:09,531 --> 00:08:11,031
What the fuck, man?

165
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:13,325
This is exactly why
you never set your picnic up

166
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:15,119
next to a pile of dog...

167
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,453
Shit! Okay.

168
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:18,080
Hello, Mitch.

169
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:20,082
Uh, look.

170
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:21,543
Wait, wait, wait!

171
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:25,003
Okay, hold on. I'm-I'm sorry.

172
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:26,588
Okay? I'm sorry.

173
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:27,881
It's too late for sorrys.

174
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:29,717
You took something
you can never give back.

175
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:32,594
Well, we can give it back.
That's not a problem.

176
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:34,972
We'll just give it all
back to you. There it is.

177
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:36,056
Go ahead.

178
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:38,392
- Have it. No problem.

00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:42,521
Th-the drugs we stole
from your boss, sir.

181
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:44,189
I'm sorry.

182
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,858
Uh, who do you think I am?

183
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:48,193
A-A hit man sent to kill us.

I am something much,

186
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:57,996
much worse.

187
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:02,667
I'm a friend of Caitlyn.

Wait. What did you say about
a hit man sent to kill you?

199
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,127
Oh.

200
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,545
(Deep voice):
Who are you?

201
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:50,006
A friend of Caitlyn's.

Uh, more of an acquaintance.

Yeah, of course
the hit is going well.

chased away
from every corner of the globe,

our options and bank account
have become a little limited.

It's not exactly a castle,

280

but it is exactly
the kind of place

281
00:13:14,836 --> 00:13:18,630
no one tends to notice

That's Doug, I believe.

This one doesn't even
have a head.

Oh, no, he did have a head.

306
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:19,524
You know, I don't ask
for much, renfield.

307
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:22,611
Just the blood
of a few dozen innocent people.

308
00:14:22,612 --> 00:14:23,987
I know. I'm sorry, master.

309
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:25,405
Let's-let's get you sat down,
and then...

310
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:28,158
I want happy couples,
unsuspecting tourists,

311
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:33,163
a handful of nuns, a-a...
A busload of cheerleaders.

312
00:14:33,164 --> 00:14:35,582
A busload of cheerleaders?

313
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,125
A busload of cheerleaders

314
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:40,212
will get me back to full power
like that.

315
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:42,214
Do you mean female cheerleaders?

316
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:45,634
Don't make it a sexual thing.

317
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:47,719
No, no. I did not say it was.

318
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:51,389
You know it's not the gender
I'm concerned with.

319
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:54,851
You know, i-I'll eat boys,
I'll eat girls.

320
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:56,394
It's the purity.

321
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:59,898
It alone will bring me
back to...

322
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,567
Full power.

323
00:15:02,527 --> 00:15:03,568
I get it, master.

324
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:06,863
You deserve better.

325
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:09,700
But the modern world
is a dangerous place.

326
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:13,453
Maybe if we were just
a little bit more careful,

327
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:17,082
we could, you know,
stop running.

328
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:20,169
You know, settle down,
and I could have...

329
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:25,174
We could have a life again.

330
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:29,303
(Grunts)

331
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:35,183
It must be difficult

332
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:39,479
to be caught between
their rules and mine.

333
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,149
(Groaning)

334
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:47,904
Their rules offer
a confusing tangle of morality,

335
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:50,657
whereas mine are very simple.

336
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:53,785
You can kill and eat

337
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:56,746
whatever you want and never die.

338
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:59,082
And it truly is a gift.

339
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:01,543
And yet, you seem to think
it makes you

340
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:04,045
some sort of a monster.

341
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:07,299
Do you have any idea
how inconsiderate that is?

342
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,509
(Crying):
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

343
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:14,306
My needs are the only thing
that matters, servant.

344
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:16,308
And what exactly are my needs?

345
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:19,644
Um, your needs, your needs
were the, uh...

346
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:25,025
Uh, happy couples,
u-unsuspecting tourists, uh...

347
00:16:25,026 --> 00:16:28,320
Nuns, nuns
and a-a busload of cheerleaders.

348
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:30,823
Indeed.

349
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:34,659
Renfield: I suppose this is what
you'd call my health-care plan.

350
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,371
His blood has the power
to heal the injured.

351
00:16:38,206 --> 00:16:40,165
And there's not even a copay.

352
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:42,375
Unless you consider my soul.

353
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:47,673

exactly what I want.

Teddy:
I cannot go to jail.

355
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:51,218
I'll tell you anything
you want to know.

356
00:16:51,219 --> 00:16:52,094
What do you want to know?

357
00:16:52,095 --> 00:16:53,720
Murders! Murders.

358
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:56,514
We fucking murdered so many
fucking people in cold blood.

359
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:59,142
Like last night, for example,
we murdered these people

360
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:01,353
for trying to steal our drugs.

361
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:03,980
That's a twofer, my man.
That is a fucking twofer.

362
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:06,691
Nobody's been in the room yet,
and he's already confessing.

363

You see that?

364
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:10,195

the entire fucking lobo empire

365
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:11,947
off of one traffic stop.

367

369

- Let's go.

by the way. -What the f...

371

- I'm out, baby!
- What the fuck is this?

372
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,792
Excuse me, everybody.
Guess what.

373
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:25,043
Fuck you!

374
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,420

375

Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
What is this?

376
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:31,132
He was about to give up
everything.

377
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:32,759
He was ready to say anything

378
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,719
because of the trauma
you put him through.

379
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,429
He was already traumatized
when I found him.

380
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,223
For crying out loud, Quincy.

381
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:39,557
-(Stammers) -Your job is
to bust drunk drivers,

382
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:41,142
not single-handedly
bring down the mob.

383
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:42,560
He was running
from something, sir.

384
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:44,729
And then he crashed
into a dui checkpoint,

385
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,231
committed ten felonies,

386
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:48,275
and not to mention eff-you-ing
a room full of cops.

387
00:17:48,276 --> 00:17:51,152
- You eff-you me all the time.
- Fuck you, Kyle!

388
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:53,072
Look, Quincy.

389
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:57,158
Your father was
one of the most honest

390
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:59,744
and incorruptible cops I knew.

391
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:01,746
And you're a lot like him.

392
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:03,957
And before he passed,
I promised your father that

393
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:05,667
I would do my best
to take care of you.

394
00:18:05,668 --> 00:18:08,920
But sometimes, you got to know
when to play ball.

395
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:11,214
This ain't your stepping stone.

396

402

Catch Teddy lobo
committing a crime, and then:

403
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:51,713
What? Oh, surprise,
he got away with it again.

404
00:18:51,714 --> 00:18:54,632
And what about your-your little
FBI, uh, task force up there?

405

I want revenge

00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:28,527
(Grunting, yelling)

535
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:37,995
(Pained yelling)

536
00:25:38,996 --> 00:25:40,122
(Screams)

537
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:55,012
- (Grunts)
- (Screams)

538
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:08,859
(Screams)

539
00:26:11,904 --> 00:26:13,989
- (Man yells)
- (Gasps)

540
00:26:16,492 --> 00:26:17,785
(Man yells)

541
00:26:27,336 --> 00:26:29,254
Fuck! Shit!

542
00:26:33,509 --> 00:26:35,219
(Gasps)

543
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:39,723
(Men screaming)

544
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:49,900
(Panting)

545
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:52,902
- (Man groans)
- Oh.

546
00:26:52,903 --> 00:26:55,030
- (Gunshot)
- (Man groans, body thuds)

547
00:26:55,948 --> 00:26:57,323
Renfield:
Are you okay?

548
00:26:57,324 --> 00:26:58,574
Yeah. Yeah. Oh...

549
00:26:58,575 --> 00:27:00,159
That was amazing.
You were amazing.

550
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,786
What you did.

551
00:27:01,787 --> 00:27:03,914
You stood up to him.

552
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:06,582
How did you do that?

553
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:07,917
What kind of life would I lead

554
00:27:07,918 --> 00:27:09,627
under the thumb
of one of those assholes?

555
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:13,214
A very... a very sad one.

556
00:27:13,215 --> 00:27:14,465
Yeah.

557
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:16,133
Did I watch you
cut a guy's arms off

558
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:17,635
with a decorative
serving platter?

559
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:20,179
Oh, uh, y-yeah.

560
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,430
That was adrenaline.

561
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:23,641
Uh, it was awesome.

562
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:25,852
(Chuckles softly)

563
00:27:25,853 --> 00:27:27,979
Um, i-i'm-I'm Rebecca Quincy.

564
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,605
Officer... officer Quincy.

565
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:32,441
Robert montague renfield.

566
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:34,610
Oh, uh, montague. Cool.

567
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:36,320
Are you from around here or...

568
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:38,489
Oh, no. I'm...

569
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:40,324
Uh, everywhere.

570
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:41,909
Ah, military.

571
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:44,203
That-that would explain
all the moves.

572
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:47,707
Yeah, but forever ago...
The great war.

573
00:27:47,708 --> 00:27:49,917
Uh... Iraq.

574
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:51,335
Maybe not great, uh, you know,

575
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:53,462
but overall pretty good...
Three out of five stars.

576
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:54,839
Woman:
I'm sorry.

577
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:58,676
I don't mean to interrupt
whatever this is,

578
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:00,469
but...

579
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:02,430
Can we get up now?

580
00:28:02,431 --> 00:28:04,181
Uh, yeah.

581
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:06,058
If I could have everyone
please, uh,

582
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:08,144
just line up for me
for witness statements.

583
00:28:08,145 --> 00:28:10,646
And if we could all thank
Mr. Renfield

584
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:13,649
for his brave, uh,
efforts today.

585
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:15,276
Group:
Thank you, Mr. Renfield.

586
00:28:15,277 --> 00:28:17,194
Man:
You are the man, Mr. Renfield.

587
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:19,323
And, um, thank you.

588
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:22,408
Y-You... you saved my life.

589
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:24,702
I...

590
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:26,914
Saved a life?

591
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:29,833
You saved all our lives.

592
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,544
You must really not be
from around here,

593
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:36,672
'cause we certainly don't see
your kind very often.

594
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:38,591
I'm sorry, what kind is that?

595
00:28:38,592 --> 00:28:40,844
Heroes.

596
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:46,391
Hmm.

597
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:52,897
Renfield:
Wow. That was amazing.

598
00:28:52,898 --> 00:28:55,901
She is amazing.

599
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:58,235
And she saw me.

600
00:28:58,236 --> 00:29:00,696
She really saw me.

601
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:03,282
That hasn't happened in ages.

602
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:05,326
I'd forgotten
what it feels like.

603
00:29:05,327 --> 00:29:07,453
- Maybe there is hope.
- Oh, god bless you.

604
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:08,746
Maybe she can...

605
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:10,456
Renfield.

606
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:13,668
What are you doing?

607
00:29:13,669 --> 00:29:16,087
Get here now.

608
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:17,922
Renfield:
Ah, fuck.

609
00:29:17,923 --> 00:29:20,050
Do you think it's too late
to grab one of those nuns?

610
00:29:22,928 --> 00:29:26,138
What did we talk about
yesterday?

611
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:27,264
U-Um...

612
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:30,935
I've been up all day
thinking about it.

613
00:29:30,936 --> 00:29:33,562
Oh. What's this?

614
00:29:33,563 --> 00:29:36,023
Ah. My plan.

615
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:37,608
Renfield:
Your plan?

616
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:40,569
But your plan has always been
to just drink blood.

617
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:42,029
Exactly.

618
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:44,532
What have I been doing
all these years?

619
00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:47,952
I mean, look at me,
lurking in the shadows and filth

620
00:29:47,953 --> 00:29:50,037
like some kind
of a diseased animal.

621
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:52,081
You said it yourself...
I deserve better.

622
00:29:52,082 --> 00:29:57,504
So, why am I not embracing
what I truly am?

623
00:29:58,505 --> 00:29:59,798
Which is?

624
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:04,010
A god, renfield.

625
00:30:04,011 --> 00:30:07,805
An immortal, insatiable...

626
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:11,392
Whoo! All-powerful being.

627
00:30:11,393 --> 00:30:14,311
Everything you said about
the modern world is true.

628
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:18,232
- It is a dangerous place.
- Hmm.

629
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:20,484
Only not for us.

630
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:25,197
For them, it's a dangerous,
sad, broken place

631
00:30:25,198 --> 00:30:27,700
full of fear and desperation.

632
00:30:27,701 --> 00:30:29,201
It's weak.

633
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:32,747
Longing for a powerful force
to guide it,

634
00:30:32,748 --> 00:30:37,710
control it, dominate it.

635
00:30:37,711 --> 00:30:39,545
- Like you.
- Hmm. (Chuckles)

636
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:44,008
I mean, this entire society
was designed by renfields,

637
00:30:44,009 --> 00:30:45,843
for renfields.

638
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:49,805
So, why should I
have to adapt to it?

639
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:52,892
It should have to adapt to me.

640
00:30:52,893 --> 00:30:54,226
(Chuckling)

641
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:56,353
- I owe it all to you, servant.
- Oh, no.

642
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:58,230
I think you actually might have
read between the lines

643
00:30:58,231 --> 00:30:59,690
- a little bit there.
- Indeed.

644
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:01,817
We're in this together,

645
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:03,945
Dracula and renfield.

646
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:07,573
From now on, humanity
will no longer be divided

647
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:10,034
by the good and the evil,

648
00:31:10,035 --> 00:31:14,205
only by followers...

649
00:31:14,206 --> 00:31:16,624
And food.

650
00:31:16,625 --> 00:31:19,002
(Slurping)

651
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:24,799
You and I forever,
until the end of time.

652
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,927
Bloody hell.

653
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:30,387
Carol:
How is my life?

654
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:32,556
My life is like a...

655
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:37,103
Never-ending hallway
of fun house mirrors, but...

656
00:31:37,104 --> 00:31:39,396
All the clowns are me.

657
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:40,898
Uh, hey, everyone.

658
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:42,900
I need your help.

659
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:44,068
Are you okay?

660
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:45,904
Renfield:
No.

661
00:31:47,072 --> 00:31:49,740
I need to get out
of a toxic relationship.

662
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:53,661
Okay. Well, well, well, well,
take a seat and let her rip.

663
00:31:53,662 --> 00:31:55,246
Okay, thanks.

664
00:31:55,247 --> 00:31:57,248
Okay, yeah. Fuck Carol, I guess.

665
00:31:57,249 --> 00:31:58,707
It's...

666
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:00,251
I hate her, too.

667
00:32:00,252 --> 00:32:02,169
Mark: Why don't you start
by telling us

668
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:04,088
what brought you here
in the first place.

669
00:32:04,089 --> 00:32:06,006
I was on the job.

670
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:07,633
Uh, for my boss.

671
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:09,844
Uh, well, and I was
actually following Bob,

672
00:32:09,845 --> 00:32:11,887
because I thought
that Bob would make

673
00:32:11,888 --> 00:32:13,932
a very good, um, uh...

674
00:32:15,517 --> 00:32:17,018
Friend?

675
00:32:17,853 --> 00:32:19,728
Yes. Thank you, Bob.

676
00:32:19,729 --> 00:32:20,980
Thank you, renfield.

677
00:32:20,981 --> 00:32:23,649
And then, you know,
I started to hear

678
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:27,529
all of your stories and...

679
00:32:31,158 --> 00:32:34,285
I mean, they were all so sad.

680
00:32:34,286 --> 00:32:35,619
(Laughter)

681
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,246
That's us.

682
00:32:37,247 --> 00:32:42,168
And, you know,
for the first time in years,

683
00:32:42,169 --> 00:32:44,171
I felt like I wasn't alone.

684
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:47,381
-You realized you're
a codependent. -Mm-hmm.

685
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:49,633
I need to change. I can see
that I-I need to change,

686
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:52,303
and, uh, I want to, but my boss,

687
00:32:52,304 --> 00:32:54,054
he's pretty delusional, I think.

688
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:56,682
Uh, he thinks
he can take over the world.

689
00:32:56,683 --> 00:32:59,268
- (Light laughter)
- He's a narcissist, renfield.

690
00:32:59,269 --> 00:33:00,644
We all know exactly
how you feel.

691
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:01,770
- Yes.
- Exactly.

692
00:33:01,771 --> 00:33:03,355
No, he's different.

693
00:33:03,356 --> 00:33:05,357
-You can't get him
out of your head. -No.

694
00:33:05,358 --> 00:33:06,859
Ooh, and you feel like
he could kill you

695
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,235
with the snap of his fingers.

696
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:10,112
-Yes. Wouldn't even
need to snap. -Oh.

697
00:33:10,113 --> 00:33:12,656
He controls rats with his mind.

698
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:14,033
Uh...

699
00:33:14,034 --> 00:33:15,201
It's okay, it's okay.
He's on medication.

700
00:33:15,202 --> 00:33:19,246
Renfield, this is
codependency 101.

701
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:21,248
A narcissist will take
full advantage

702
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:23,292
of a codependent's
low self-esteem,

703
00:33:23,293 --> 00:33:27,838
but you're the one
with the real power.

704
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:31,175
And all you got to do
is take it back.

705
00:33:31,176 --> 00:33:32,676
How do I do that?

706
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:35,262
Focus on your needs.

707
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:38,140
I mean, I just haven't
thought about

708
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:39,934
any of my needs in years.

709
00:33:39,935 --> 00:33:42,811
But if you were to stop focusing
on his needs, what would happen?

710
00:33:42,812 --> 00:33:44,855
If I don't...

711
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:45,856
Yeah, what would happen?

712
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:47,066
Stop focusing on his needs.

713
00:33:47,067 --> 00:33:48,651
What would happen?

714
00:33:48,652 --> 00:33:50,319
- He won't grow to full power.

715
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,696
Exactly.
He won't grow to full power.

716
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:54,240
What? That's so weird.

717
00:33:54,241 --> 00:33:56,033
Why would you phrase it
like that?

718
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:58,118
But yes, he's right.

719
00:33:58,119 --> 00:33:59,828
He's absolutely right.

720
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:01,580
He won't grow to full power.

721
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:04,416
You can take all that energy
you've spent on him

722
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:06,335
and put it toward yourself.

723
00:34:06,336 --> 00:34:11,757
And then you will be the one
who grows to full power.

724
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:13,259

- Man: Full power.

I-I'm gonna grow to full power?

726
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:16,971
I want to hear you say it.

727
00:34:16,972 --> 00:34:19,139
Say, "I'm gonna grow
to full power."

728
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:21,225
I-i-I'm gonna grow
to full power.

729
00:34:21,226 --> 00:34:23,644
I heard you say it,
but I didn't believe you.

730
00:34:23,645 --> 00:34:25,604
- Nope.
- Let me hear you say it again.

731
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:27,731
- I'm gonna grow to full power.
- Group: Yes!

732
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:29,566
I see a smile there
because you like it.

733
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:31,902
Now, say it like
the world needs to hear it.

734
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:34,571

in front of a bunch of witnesses

769
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:47,603

to put Teddy lobo behind bars.

I don't know
how many of you assholes

are on the lobos' payroll,

773
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:55,819
but there's only so much
evidence you can tamper with

774
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:57,821
and so many witnesses
you can intimidate.

775
00:35:57,822 --> 00:35:59,365
All right? Because eventually,

776
00:35:59,366 --> 00:36:01,575
someone brave enough
is going to step forward,

777
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:03,994
and they're going to help me
take down the lobos

00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:05,871

yes, at your service.

Um, I'm here to give

Thank you for coming in,
Mr. Renfield.

798

It really means a lot.

799
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:02,177
Yeah, it means a lot
that I can actually

800
00:37:02,178 --> 00:37:04,721
do the right thing, for once.

801
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:08,725
Well, if I could just stress
how appreciative I am

802
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:13,188
that you're here, uh,
because without you,

803
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:14,982
- I think I'd be a bit lost.
- No.

804
00:37:14,983 --> 00:37:18,652
You stood up for everyone
who's ever lived in fear

805
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:21,822
of the powerful forces
shaping their lives.

806
00:37:21,823 --> 00:37:24,408
Okay? And you need
to keep doing that,

807
00:37:24,409 --> 00:37:26,910
because when
people like you stop

808
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:29,621
standing up to people like them,

809
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:31,916
that's when
the monsters take over.

810
00:37:32,876 --> 00:37:35,378
So... (Sighs)

811
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:38,882
You are not lost.

812
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:42,801
You're an inspiration.

813
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:45,637
Thank you, Mr. Renfield.

814
00:37:45,638 --> 00:37:47,222
It's Robert.

00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:51,393
Bellafrancesca:
This is the same prick

817
00:37:51,394 --> 00:37:53,979
who took out everyone
in the restaurant.

818
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:55,606
Who does he work for?

819
00:37:55,607 --> 00:37:58,275
- The five fucking families?
- Teddy: I-I don't know.

820
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:00,235
But we've hacked into
the NSA's eye in the sky,

821
00:38:00,236 --> 00:38:01,778

822

using all these other cameras
throughout the city.

823
00:38:03,448 --> 00:38:05,073

Yeah, and then we enhance.

- It guy: We got a trace on him.
- Teddy: Boom!

826
00:38:08,328 --> 00:38:10,747
We did it.
Now we can track his every move.

827
00:38:11,748 --> 00:38:14,291
It guy: His last known location
is at the old charity hospital.

828
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:17,002
You have until the end of the
day to find him and kill him.

829
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:19,297
Give me ten minutes.

830
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:21,633
I'll take the end of the day.

831
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:25,928
Can you run the DNA on this pen
through the bureau's database?

832
00:38:25,929 --> 00:38:27,554
And Interpol.

833
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:31,017
I can't trust this with anyone
who works in my department.

834
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,353
This pen was found
near a location

835
00:38:34,354 --> 00:38:37,022

went missing.

836

when I arrested him.

838
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:42,319
Huh.

839
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,988
Word on the street is
these are the three guys

840
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:47,824
who allegedly stole drugs
from the lobos.

841
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:48,701

And the DNA evidence on this pen

843
00:38:50,912 --> 00:38:54,790

to that crime scene.

00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:33,073
and killed some of our guys

889
00:41:33,074 --> 00:41:35,075
trying to save
a bunch of innocent people.

890
00:41:35,076 --> 00:41:37,661
So, what is he,
like, your fucking roommate?

891
00:41:37,662 --> 00:41:40,080
He's my servant.

892
00:41:40,081 --> 00:41:42,499
He doesn't seem
to be serving you very well.

893
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,584
(Grunts)

894
00:41:44,585 --> 00:41:46,838
(Bats squeaking)

895
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:50,006
Rebecca (recorded):
You've reached officer Quincy.

896
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:52,008
Please state your emergency
at the sound of the beep.

897
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:53,927
- (Beep)
- Renfield: Uh, hi, Rebecca.

898
00:41:53,928 --> 00:41:56,096
It's not an emergency.
It-it's me, Robert.

899
00:41:56,097 --> 00:41:59,808
What, uh, I was trying
to ask was, um,

900
00:41:59,809 --> 00:42:02,436
maybe you'd like
to get a bite to eat...

901
00:42:02,437 --> 00:42:04,813
Hello, renfield.

902
00:42:04,814 --> 00:42:06,690
I've been expecting you.

903
00:42:06,691 --> 00:42:08,525
Please, come in.

904
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:10,236
Close the door.

905
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:15,533
Shit.

906
00:42:16,743 --> 00:42:20,036
Marvelous attire.

907
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:21,830
Very colorful.

908
00:42:21,831 --> 00:42:24,833
You look like the sort of boy
who has to fight 'em off.

909
00:42:24,834 --> 00:42:25,918
(Laughs)

910
00:42:26,753 --> 00:42:29,963
So, I suppose that's a no

911
00:42:29,964 --> 00:42:33,258
as to you bringing me
my dinner tonight, hmm?

912
00:42:33,259 --> 00:42:34,718
- A no? No.
- No?

913
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:36,344
(Chuckles):
No, not a no.

914
00:42:36,345 --> 00:42:38,430
- No, not no?
- Uh, yes.

915
00:42:38,431 --> 00:42:39,556
(Chuckles)

916
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:41,433
Big yes to dinner.

917
00:42:41,434 --> 00:42:43,977
Ooh. Um, a feast.
A full feast, master.

918
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:45,729
In fact,
I'm so glad you're here.

919
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:49,399
Um, I was actually, um...
I was on my way to see you.

920
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,901
Oh, you were on your way.

921
00:42:50,902 --> 00:42:54,112
Yes, but I had, um,
too many bodies.

922
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:56,239
- Oh, you-you have bodies, huh?
- Yeah, too... too many.

923
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,867
Well, uh, so many bodies, um,
that I couldn't carry them all.

924
00:42:58,868 --> 00:43:00,410
- Uh, you should have seen it.
- Mm. Mm-hmm.

925
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:02,954
The problem is my back
has really been playing up.

926
00:43:02,955 --> 00:43:05,457
Anyway, the-the plan is
to rent a u-haul, and that way,

927
00:43:05,458 --> 00:43:07,417
-I'll be able to get all
the bodies... -Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

928
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:10,003
You know what? It's so silly,
but you don't have to worry,

929
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:13,173
um, and I-I won't bother you
with my-my problems.

930
00:43:13,174 --> 00:43:14,841
No, no.

931
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:18,762
Please, tell me
all about your problems.

932
00:43:18,763 --> 00:43:23,600
Tell me all about
the gun-wielding criminals

933
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:25,477
who came after you
for killing their men

934
00:43:25,478 --> 00:43:31,025
because you were protecting
so-called innocent people.

935
00:43:31,776 --> 00:43:33,985
I'm-I'm sorry.

936
00:43:33,986 --> 00:43:36,613
I'm sorry, master.
I never meant to hurt you.

937
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:39,282
Hurt me?

938
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:41,284
Are you actually suggesting

939
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:45,330
that anything you could do
would hurt...

940
00:43:45,331 --> 00:43:46,957
Me?!

941
00:43:46,958 --> 00:43:48,708
No. No, no, no, no, no.
No, master, I'm sorry.

942
00:43:48,709 --> 00:43:50,126
I didn't mean...
I didn't mean that.

943
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:51,419
No, no, it's-it's all right.
It's all right.

944
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:52,754
- Really?
- No, it's... yeah.

945
00:43:52,755 --> 00:43:54,130
Let me explain
something to you, okay?

946
00:43:54,131 --> 00:43:56,925
- Okay.
- I was wrong about you.

947
00:43:56,926 --> 00:44:00,470
I should've realized
what you were capable of

948
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:02,848
when you were so eager
to join me.

949
00:44:02,849 --> 00:44:04,683
I-I don't think I was eager.

950
00:44:04,684 --> 00:44:06,059
I think that you caught me
at a low moment

951
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:07,644
-and you maybe manipulated me,
too. -No, no, no,

952
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:09,437
-no, no... -And you just
caught me at a low moment

953
00:44:09,438 --> 00:44:11,481
- and used some of your power...
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

954
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:14,568
I use my power
for a lot of things,

955
00:44:14,569 --> 00:44:16,528
but I didn't need
to use it on you.

956
00:44:16,529 --> 00:44:18,905
You were a lawyer
who wanted to get rich

957
00:44:18,906 --> 00:44:20,949
off a real estate deal.

958
00:44:20,950 --> 00:44:22,826
You're the one who used me!

959
00:44:22,827 --> 00:44:26,830
You used my power
because you're a husk.

960
00:44:26,831 --> 00:44:30,125
An empty void
that nothing can fill.

961
00:44:30,126 --> 00:44:34,838
The only thing that gave your
life any meaning was my power.

962
00:44:34,839 --> 00:44:37,966
The power you used
to bring me victims

963
00:44:37,967 --> 00:44:40,427
while you pretended
to be one yourself.

964
00:44:40,428 --> 00:44:41,636
(Exhales heavily)

965
00:44:41,637 --> 00:44:45,181
However,
I'm the real victim here!

966
00:44:45,182 --> 00:44:48,936
I'm the one
you swore to protect!

967
00:44:50,313 --> 00:44:52,355
And you...

968
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:54,150
Abandoned me!

969
00:44:55,151 --> 00:44:56,568
No.

970
00:44:56,569 --> 00:44:58,361
That's not true.

971
00:44:58,362 --> 00:45:01,740
Just like you abandoned

972
00:45:01,741 --> 00:45:05,411
your wife and your daughter.

973
00:45:07,747 --> 00:45:09,497
That's not... I didn't...

974
00:45:09,498 --> 00:45:11,041
I didn't abandon them.

975
00:45:11,042 --> 00:45:14,753
Look into your own eyes,
renfield.

976
00:45:14,754 --> 00:45:19,091
You're the monster, renfield,
not me.

977
00:45:22,803 --> 00:45:24,722
It's you.

978
00:45:25,514 --> 00:45:27,849
No. No.

979
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:31,312
That's enough. That's enough.

980
00:45:36,484 --> 00:45:37,525
What?

981
00:45:37,526 --> 00:45:39,362
(Sighs)

982
00:45:42,073 --> 00:45:44,407
I will no longer tolerate abuse.

983
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:46,284
(Laughing)

984
00:45:46,285 --> 00:45:47,744
Stop laughing.

985
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:49,246
I deserve love.

986
00:45:50,247 --> 00:45:51,665
I deserve happiness.

987
00:45:51,666 --> 00:45:53,960
You deserve only suffering.

988
00:45:55,086 --> 00:45:58,421
Um, oh. I know being undead,
it's a painful existence...

989
00:45:58,422 --> 00:46:00,924
It is... and I empathize
with your pain.

990
00:46:00,925 --> 00:46:02,550
Oh, please. Illuminate me.

991
00:46:02,551 --> 00:46:03,927
Let me learn from you.

992
00:46:03,928 --> 00:46:07,597
I will find everyone
you have ever loved,

993
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:09,933
and I will drain them.

994
00:46:09,934 --> 00:46:13,311
- I will reduce this... this...
- S-Studio apartment?

995
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:16,731
Studio apartment until it's ash!

996
00:46:16,732 --> 00:46:19,527
Uh... uh...

997
00:46:21,529 --> 00:46:23,321
Affirmations, affirmations.

998
00:46:23,322 --> 00:46:26,866
Uh, I'm enough, and, um,
I deserve some happiness.

999
00:46:26,867 --> 00:46:29,244
There is some other stuff
that I have to say.

1000
00:46:29,245 --> 00:46:32,289
Who put these ideas
in your head?

1001
00:46:35,126 --> 00:46:37,211
(Sighs)

1002
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:40,214
Of course.

1003
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:43,801
(Whooshing)

1004
00:46:45,094 --> 00:46:46,429
What?

1005
00:46:52,226 --> 00:46:53,811
Shit.

1006
00:46:55,521 --> 00:46:58,690
You think Doug was murdered?

1007
00:46:58,691 --> 00:47:01,192
I can't say for sure, but I...

1008
00:47:01,193 --> 00:47:04,154
I hope he was fucking murdered.

1009
00:47:04,155 --> 00:47:08,283
I hope he was torn to
itty-bitty pieces and then...

1010
00:47:08,284 --> 00:47:11,995
I shouldn't be saying that
to a cop, right?

1011
00:47:11,996 --> 00:47:14,414
Caitlyn:
Karla, margaritas are ready!

1012
00:47:14,415 --> 00:47:16,583
Caitlyn! Oh, god. This...

1013
00:47:16,584 --> 00:47:17,751
Caitlyn:
Try this.

1014
00:47:17,752 --> 00:47:18,877
Are you Caitlyn berggren?

1015
00:47:18,878 --> 00:47:20,503
I can be anybody I want now.

1016
00:47:20,504 --> 00:47:22,172
That's right. Yes, you can.

1017
00:47:22,173 --> 00:47:25,050
Did you file a missing persons
report for Mitch Flaherty?

1018
00:47:25,051 --> 00:47:26,968
- Maybe.
- Are you Caitlyn?

1019
00:47:26,969 --> 00:47:28,553
H-How do you two
know each other?

1020
00:47:28,554 --> 00:47:31,347
-Um, from this support group
thing. -(Snickers)

1021
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:34,059
Uh, for people addicted
to assholes.

At the livespring church.

1025
00:47:40,024 --> 00:47:44,194
Carol: I realized that
I can identify healthy love.

1026
00:47:44,195 --> 00:47:47,447
I just don't think I deserve it.

1027
00:47:47,448 --> 00:47:49,657
Um, and that's partially
the shame talking,

1028
00:47:49,658 --> 00:47:50,867
but also the rash...

1029
00:47:50,868 --> 00:47:52,243
Renfield?

1030
00:47:52,244 --> 00:47:54,788
Can I get through
one fucking share, please?

1031
00:47:54,789 --> 00:47:56,498
Is, uh... is everyone okay?

1032
00:47:56,499 --> 00:47:58,166
-If that's what you want to
call it. -Mark: We're all fine.

1033
00:47:58,167 --> 00:48:00,001
-What's going on?
What's going on? -We, uh...

1034
00:48:00,002 --> 00:48:01,419
We need to leave. Now.

1035
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:03,254
I mean, where's the rule
that says we have to talk

1036
00:48:03,255 --> 00:48:05,048
about our feelings in a gym?
Come on, please.

1037
00:48:05,049 --> 00:48:07,342
Up. Up. Let's go somewhere safe
till morning.

1038
00:48:07,343 --> 00:48:08,885
Come on, up.
Everybody, move. Come on.

1039
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:10,220
Renfield,
just take a deep breath.

1040
00:48:10,221 --> 00:48:12,222
We are all fine. I promise...

1041
00:48:12,223 --> 00:48:14,099
Mark, we need to leave now.

1042
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:15,893
- All right...

1043
00:48:18,437 --> 00:48:22,649
Hi. Uh, are you here
for the meeting?

1044
00:48:22,650 --> 00:48:23,983
Well, come on in.

1045
00:48:23,984 --> 00:48:26,444
No! No! No!

Feeling much better.

Don't.

Would you like to introduce
yourself to the group?

I am known simply as...

1061
00:49:37,349 --> 00:49:39,643
- Renfield's boss!
- (Snarling)

1062
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:55,241
I am Dracula.

1063
00:49:55,242 --> 00:49:57,243
Okay.
Obviously, we're dealing with

1064
00:49:57,244 --> 00:49:59,329
a little bit more than
just narcissism here.

1065
00:49:59,330 --> 00:50:00,747
Master.

1066
00:50:00,748 --> 00:50:02,040
Please.

1067
00:50:02,041 --> 00:50:04,210
I should never
have forsaken you.

1068
00:50:10,007 --> 00:50:13,092
You could've had everything.

1069
00:50:13,093 --> 00:50:15,220
I gave you the choice between

1070
00:50:15,221 --> 00:50:18,264
(echoes loudly):
The power of a god

1071
00:50:18,265 --> 00:50:22,519
and the pathetic desperation
of humanity.

1072
00:50:24,396 --> 00:50:26,189
Why?

1073
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:29,525
Why would you choose this?

1074
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:31,570
Because...

1075
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:35,783
That's what I am.

1076
00:50:38,577 --> 00:50:41,079
Master, please.

1077
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:42,789
These are good people.

1078
00:50:42,790 --> 00:50:47,336
Good. You've finally brought me
what I've been asking for.

1079

The fact that you are
the only person that I can trust

- What?!

been to a couple of meetings...

Oh, you've-you've been
to some meetings? Yeah?

1218
00:59:00,537 --> 00:59:02,621
Where the people come in,
they're like, "oh, hi.

1225
00:59:13,675 --> 00:59:15,801
I graduated top of my class,

1226

daiquiri drive-throughs.

1228

I bust my ass
for a city that is corrupt

1229
00:59:24,561 --> 00:59:26,562
and lets the people
that killed my father

1230
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:28,230
get away with anything
they want to do.

1231
00:59:28,231 --> 00:59:31,233
But unlike you,
I can't go and take out my anger

1232
00:59:31,234 --> 00:59:34,654
by killing every asshole on the
street who I think deserves it.

1233
00:59:35,405 --> 00:59:38,073

1407
01:07:43,101 --> 01:07:45,061
What I thought I deserved.

1408
01:07:47,021 --> 01:07:50,525
I let them down in so many ways.

1409
01:07:56,197 --> 01:07:59,574
You know,
that's his greatest power.

1410
01:07:59,575 --> 01:08:02,411
He looks into your eyes
and finds

1411
01:08:02,412 --> 01:08:06,290
what you think you need
to make your life whole.

1412
01:08:06,291 --> 01:08:09,251
Your... your dreams
and your desires

1413
01:08:09,252 --> 01:08:13,756
and your... greed.

1414
01:08:14,882 --> 01:08:16,425
Your shame.

1415
01:08:16,426 --> 01:08:21,888
I blamed him for forcing me
to abandon my family,

1416
01:08:21,889 --> 01:08:24,433
but that... that's not true.

1417
01:08:24,434 --> 01:08:26,601
I...

1418
01:08:26,602 --> 01:08:30,647
I wanted all those things,
and I chose to follow him.

1419
01:08:30,648 --> 01:08:31,940
I'm not a victim. I'm...

1420
01:08:31,941 --> 01:08:34,777
I made all those mistakes
on my own.

1421
01:08:36,571 --> 01:08:39,324
Look, I don't think
you're such a bad guy.

1422
01:08:40,408 --> 01:08:42,409
Life throws
a lot of shit at you,

1423
01:08:42,410 --> 01:08:44,453
but sometimes
you fall under the thrall

1424
01:08:44,454 --> 01:08:46,455
of a vampire for a few decades,

1425
01:08:46,456 --> 01:08:50,334
and sometimes you call
your sister an unbearable twat

1426
01:08:50,335 --> 01:08:53,003
at grandma's birthday party.

1427
01:08:53,004 --> 01:08:54,838
(Chuckles softly)

1428
01:08:54,839 --> 01:08:57,966
You should make things right
with your sister while you can.

1429
01:08:57,967 --> 01:08:59,302
Hmm?

1430
01:09:00,803 --> 01:09:02,805
Speaking of.

1431
01:09:05,183 --> 01:09:07,310
I'm gonna call her.

1432
01:09:10,563 --> 01:09:12,522
Dracula:
Renfield. It's so wonderful

1433
01:09:12,523 --> 01:09:14,483
that you have finally
found someone

1434
01:09:14,484 --> 01:09:19,071
who does inspire you
to grow as a person.

1435
01:09:19,072 --> 01:09:20,530
Hey, where are you?

1436
01:09:20,531 --> 01:09:22,199
Dracula:
I have found some people

1437
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:24,326
who will unleash my potential
as well.

1438
01:09:24,327 --> 01:09:26,453
They understand this world

1439
01:09:26,454 --> 01:09:29,748
for what it is
and what it needs.

1440
01:09:29,749 --> 01:09:33,210
Bellafrancesca (over phone):
Hello, Rebecca.

1441
01:09:33,211 --> 01:09:34,836
Looking for someone?

1442
01:09:34,837 --> 01:09:36,296
Where's my sister?

1443
01:09:36,297 --> 01:09:39,341
I offered you so much, Rebecca,

1444
01:09:39,342 --> 01:09:43,345
but you put your faith
in such fragile institutions

1445
01:09:43,346 --> 01:09:47,015
instead of something
far more enduring.

1446
01:09:47,016 --> 01:09:48,850
We've got your sister.

1447
01:09:48,851 --> 01:09:51,187
She doesn't have much time.

1448
01:09:52,063 --> 01:09:54,398
Rebecca, where are you going?

1449
01:09:54,399 --> 01:09:56,525
- To get my sister.
- Rebecca, you don't understand.

1450
01:09:56,526 --> 01:09:58,777
It's not just the lobos. It's...

1451
01:09:58,778 --> 01:10:00,362
Dracula is with them.

1452
01:10:00,363 --> 01:10:02,864
- Fine. I'll go myself.
- Look, please.

1453
01:10:02,865 --> 01:10:04,449
I tried to stand up to him,

1454
01:10:04,450 --> 01:10:08,537
and he killed people
I cared about.

1455
01:10:08,538 --> 01:10:10,872
I can't let that happen again.

1456
01:10:10,873 --> 01:10:13,250
You want to be a hero, renfield?

1457
01:10:13,251 --> 01:10:15,210
You have to risk everything.

1458
01:10:15,211 --> 01:10:17,879
And as someone
that cares about you,

1459
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:20,841
you're never really gonna
be free until you face him.

1460
01:10:20,842 --> 01:10:22,467
You care about me?

1461
01:10:22,468 --> 01:10:24,261
Is that what it takes
to get you in the car?

1462
01:10:24,262 --> 01:10:26,054
All right,
if we're gonna do this,

1463
01:10:26,055 --> 01:10:29,057
we need to prepare, and
we need to do it before sunset.

1464
01:10:29,058 --> 01:10:30,684
I'm ready to do it before lunch.

1465
01:10:30,685 --> 01:10:32,394
Okay.

1466
01:10:32,395 --> 01:10:34,563
Rebecca: Let's face it,
they know we're coming,

1467
01:10:34,564 --> 01:10:36,565
so let's go in style.

1468
01:10:36,566 --> 01:10:38,316
(Engine revving,
tires squealing)

1469
01:10:38,317 --> 01:10:40,528
Yeah, just guns won't be enough.

1470
01:10:42,280 --> 01:10:46,074
I'm gonna need bugs...
Lots of bugs...

1471
01:10:46,075 --> 01:10:47,742
Wooden stakes,

1472
01:10:47,743 --> 01:10:49,744
uh, crucifixes,

1473
01:10:49,745 --> 01:10:52,330
and, uh,
maybe a protection circle.

1474
01:10:52,331 --> 01:10:53,665
What the fuck is
a protection circle?

1475
01:10:53,666 --> 01:10:55,500
It's a circle
made of powder that...

1476
01:10:55,501 --> 01:10:57,752
It-it traps demons
if you say the right,

1477
01:10:57,753 --> 01:11:00,172

- Forget it.

I won't hurt you.

It's nice to finally meet you.

1535
01:14:37,306 --> 01:14:42,060
I can only imagine what
you might have heard about me

1536
01:14:42,061 --> 01:14:44,187
from poor renfield.

1537
01:14:44,188 --> 01:14:47,982
Besides making him bring you
people to eat?

1538
01:14:47,983 --> 01:14:53,989
(Chuckling): Well, we did have
a complicated relationship.

1539
01:14:55,157 --> 01:14:58,576
However, when I saw you
through his eyes,

1540
01:14:58,577 --> 01:15:01,996
I knew I had
to make things right.

1541
01:15:01,997 --> 01:15:04,499
Having Dracula powers
is fucking amazing.

1542
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:07,086
Stop saying "Dracula powers."

1543
01:15:08,129 --> 01:15:10,171
Fine. What do you call it?

1544
01:15:10,172 --> 01:15:11,674
It's a curse.

1545
01:15:12,675 --> 01:15:15,886
God, you're such
a fucking drama queen.

1546
01:15:17,096 --> 01:15:19,431
Would you please listen?

1547
01:15:19,432 --> 01:15:21,182
They come with a cost, okay?

1548
01:15:21,183 --> 01:15:22,726
You'll become his slave.

1549
01:15:22,727 --> 01:15:26,021
See, that's where you're wrong,
because master told me...

1550
01:15:27,231 --> 01:15:28,398
Shit.

1551
01:15:28,399 --> 01:15:29,942
Mm-hmm.

1552
01:15:31,736 --> 01:15:36,072
For half a millennium,
I've seen only weakness

1553
01:15:36,073 --> 01:15:38,534
in the hearts of men.

1554
01:15:40,536 --> 01:15:45,207
And then I looked into yours.

1555
01:15:49,628 --> 01:15:54,966
Renfield used only
the smallest taste of my power

1556
01:15:54,967 --> 01:15:57,218
to do what he thought was good.

1557
01:15:57,219 --> 01:16:01,973
Imagine what I could do,
Rebecca, with you by my side.

1558
01:16:01,974 --> 01:16:04,684
We could bring
the justice you seek

1559
01:16:04,685 --> 01:16:07,271
to those who've escaped it
for too long.

1560
01:16:11,275 --> 01:16:12,902
(Groans)

1561
01:16:16,697 --> 01:16:20,242
- And I can heal your sister.

1562
01:16:23,996 --> 01:16:27,708
My blood will bring her back.

1563
01:16:28,584 --> 01:16:29,918
No.

1564
01:16:29,919 --> 01:16:32,003
Dracula:
Say the word, Rebecca,

1565
01:16:32,004 --> 01:16:35,799
and I will undo
what the lobos have done.

1566
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:38,384
All I ask in exchange...

1567
01:16:38,385 --> 01:16:40,638
(Sniffling)

1568
01:16:41,597 --> 01:16:44,974
Is for you

1569
01:16:44,975 --> 01:16:47,185
to join me.

1570
01:16:47,186 --> 01:16:48,520
No, don't listen to him.

1571
01:16:48,521 --> 01:16:51,148
He said the same shit to me.

1572
01:17:00,074 --> 01:17:01,617
Can you save her?

1573
01:17:02,409 --> 01:17:04,035
Yes.

1574
01:17:04,036 --> 01:17:05,913

1575
01:17:09,792 --> 01:17:11,459
Teddy:
What did he call you again?

1576
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:12,710
An empty fucking husk?

1577
01:17:12,711 --> 01:17:14,629
See, that... that is why

1578
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:16,589
Dracula and I work
so well together.

1579
01:17:16,590 --> 01:17:18,299
I'm a full husk,

1580
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:20,218
