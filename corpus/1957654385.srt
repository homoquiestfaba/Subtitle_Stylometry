the old, the sick, you who've
been ignored by your country.

Why have they forgotten you?

16
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:38,525
Because they've been there
too long, with their hands

out, their fingers
taking your money,

18

Thank you, Barney,
and welcome to my home.

00:06:13,673 --> 00:06:16,976
You are pitching the
most controversial program

seems to be responding.

the way the campaign is going.

of my success to my book.

for mass consumption.

127
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:52,798
So I thought I'd look
into the details.

128
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:55,067
You know anything about
the Northern Militia?

129

00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:57,503

in the office.

00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:00,840
They're very good
at what they do.

134
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:01,807
Now, they've linked
that militia's funding

135
00:09:01,908 --> 00:09:03,576
to campaign contributions.

136
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:05,311
Yeah, that's right--
your campaign.

137
00:09:05,411 --> 00:09:07,113
This is ridiculous.

138
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:09,181
Carvell's interested in
a seat in the Senate,

139
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:11,017
not in some kind of a war.

140
00:09:11,117 --> 00:09:12,518

Did you ever hear anything
unusual or see anything?

145
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,326
Uh, conversations,
documents, anything

146
00:09:20,426 --> 00:09:23,029
that would implicate Carvell
or anyone on the campaign?

147
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:24,163
No.

148
00:09:24,263 --> 00:09:27,466

man with dirty shoes.

154
00:09:35,608 --> 00:09:36,976
Yeah?

155
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:40,646
You don't really believe
any of this shit, do you?

156
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:43,482
All right, look, maybe
our information's wrong.

157
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:44,917
OK?

158
00:09:45,017 --> 00:09:47,920
Maybe someone's using
Carvell's money, an insider.

159
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,722
But if this fiction
becomes fact,

160
00:09:49,822 --> 00:09:52,592
major shit's gonna go down.

161
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:55,561
These are dangerous people.

162
00:09:55,661 --> 00:09:58,598
I'd just hate to
see you get burned.

163
00:09:58,698 --> 00:10:00,866
Yeah, thanks.

164
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:03,736
All right, I tell you
what-- um, I'll let you

165
00:10:03,836 --> 00:10:04,904
know if I hear anything more.

166
00:10:08,174 --> 00:10:10,910
Oh, and, uh, you
owe me a shoeshine.

167
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:36,602
FRANK: They're religious
extremists, Carla.

168
00:10:36,702 --> 00:10:38,270
They have to say that.

169
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:39,205
No.

170
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,707
No, listen.

171
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:43,242
Listen to me.

172
00:10:43,342 --> 00:10:44,910
Use the quote from "The LA
Times" to launch the campaign.

173
00:10:45,011 --> 00:10:45,645
Spin.

174
00:10:45,745 --> 00:10:46,545
Spin, Carla.

175
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,514
This is why I hired you.

176
00:10:48,614 --> 00:10:49,715
All right, look-- yeah.

177
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:50,616
Get some rest.

178
00:10:50,716 --> 00:10:53,386
I'll call you tomorrow.

Talk to me.

182
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:12,271
Hi.

The, uh, ratings from the talk
show are through the roof.

184
00:11:14,874 --> 00:11:16,742
Networks have been running
our sound bites all day.

185
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:17,743
Everything's just great.

186
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:19,545
Love it.

187
00:11:19,645 --> 00:11:20,846
Car's ready.

188
00:11:20,946 --> 00:11:22,748
I'll be right there.

189
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:24,417
I'm going to Colorado.
I'll be back Sunday.

190
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:25,351
Well, I'll pack.

191
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:26,619
No, no, no.

192
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:28,220
It's a family thing.

193
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,922
You got a copy of
Friday night's speech

194
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:31,190
I can look at on the plane?

195
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:33,726
FRANK: Uh, I'm working
on it as we speak.

196
00:11:33,826 --> 00:11:34,994
Can I see it now?

197
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:38,564
Uh, well, you can
see it when it's done.

198
00:11:38,664 --> 00:11:39,532
Better be great.

199
00:11:39,632 --> 00:11:40,466
It'll be great.

200
00:11:40,566 --> 00:11:41,700
It'll be incredible.

201
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:45,271
[music playing]

202
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:33,152
Over there.

203
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:36,122
[music playing]

204
00:12:42,628 --> 00:12:45,998
Agent Luckenbill, FBI!

205
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:48,134
That's Agent Green.

206
00:12:48,234 --> 00:12:50,336
You're Frank
Jennings, aren't you?

207
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:51,604
You all right?

208
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:52,905
What do you want?

209
00:12:53,005 --> 00:12:55,741
Fitzpatrick said we
should talk to you.

210
00:12:55,841 --> 00:12:57,076
Said we could help each other.

211
00:12:57,176 --> 00:12:58,844
If this is gonna be a
conversation about this,

212
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:01,347
uh, secret militia stuff,
you got the wrong man.

213
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:02,414
Yeah?

214
00:13:02,515 --> 00:13:05,451
We can trace six arms
transactions back

215
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:06,786
to his campaign accounts, Frank.

216
00:13:06,886 --> 00:13:09,054
So he can what, blow
up all the districts

217
00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:09,955
that don't vote for him?

218
00:13:10,055 --> 00:13:10,890
I mean, come on, guys.

219
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,191
Give me a break.

220
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,093
It appears that this
group is responsible

221
00:13:14,193 --> 00:13:17,496
for several high-tech
military ordinance burglaries.

222
00:13:17,596 --> 00:13:20,733
We think Aidan Carvell is
up to his ass involved.

223
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:22,268
Well, you're wrong.

224
00:13:22,368 --> 00:13:26,805
Aidan Carvell is an honest
man, and he loves his country.

225
00:13:26,906 --> 00:13:29,608
We did a little homework
on you, Lieutenant.

226
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:31,477
Snuck a peak at
your Naval records.

227
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:32,978
Quite impressive.

228
00:13:33,078 --> 00:13:35,648
Graduated with honors
from the Academy, Naval

229
00:13:35,748 --> 00:13:37,950
Intelligence for five years.

230
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:39,952
It also said you're
a principled man

231
00:13:40,052 --> 00:13:41,520
with extremely high standards.

232
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,355
AGENT GREEN: Please
understand what it is we're

233
00:13:43,455 --> 00:13:44,323
dealing with here.

234
00:13:44,423 --> 00:13:46,125
This group is
stockpiling weapons.

235
00:13:46,225 --> 00:13:48,794
I mean, as crazy as this
sounds, these people are trying

236
00:13:48,894 --> 00:13:50,429
to take over the country.

237
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:51,730
You're right.

238
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:54,400
It does sound crazy,
and I don't believe it.

239
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,736
Matt McCaster,
Carvell's security chief?

240
00:13:57,836 --> 00:13:59,271
Ex FBI.

241
00:13:59,371 --> 00:14:02,608
Foiled a political assassination
attempt eight years ago.

242
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:04,910
Got a big promotion
until the Bureau

243
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:07,413
found out he staged
the whole thing.

244
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:08,781
That sound familiar?

245
00:14:08,881 --> 00:14:11,617
[music playing]

246
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:14,687
Can you guys
prove any of this?

247
00:14:14,787 --> 00:14:16,488
Not yet.

248
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:18,924
That's why we need your help.

249
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:20,326
We need access to
Carvell's computer.

250
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:21,994
AGENT GREEN: And on the
off chance Carvell comes

251
00:14:22,094 --> 00:14:23,863
up clean, we pack up and leave.

252
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:25,965
No harm, no foul.

253
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:26,932
Think about it.

254
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:30,436
[music playing]

255
00:14:31,503 --> 00:14:32,771
Keep in touch.

256
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:35,908
[music playing]

257
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:41,847
Hey.

258
00:14:41,947 --> 00:14:42,982
Hi.

259
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:44,250
What are you
doing up so early?

260
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:46,652
Mmm, couldn't stop
thinking about what

261
00:14:46,752 --> 00:14:47,620
you told me last night.

262
00:14:51,156 --> 00:14:52,524
I just can't believe
what's going on.

263
00:14:55,194 --> 00:14:57,496
Aidan's been like a
second father to me.

264
00:14:57,596 --> 00:14:58,430
Well, can you talk to him?

265
00:14:58,530 --> 00:14:59,632
Um, maybe there's a--

266
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:02,468
a logical explanation.

267
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:05,137
Yeah, maybe.

268
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:06,972
Problem is, what if there's not?

269
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:10,542
[music playing]

270
00:15:14,046 --> 00:15:15,948
I love you, honey.

271
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:19,551
[music playing]

272
00:17:03,322 --> 00:17:05,391
My triumph is your triumph.

273
00:17:05,491 --> 00:17:08,794
[music playing]

274
00:18:37,182 --> 00:18:38,083
[door closing]

[music playing]

276
00:18:47,192 --> 00:18:49,061
Well, working late?

277
00:18:49,161 --> 00:18:50,662
[elevator dinging]

278
00:18:50,762 --> 00:18:51,663
Yeah.

279
00:18:51,763 --> 00:18:54,666
[music playing]

280
00:19:06,345 --> 00:19:08,847
Hey, Frank.

281
00:19:08,947 --> 00:19:10,382
How'd you do?

282
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:13,385
I got into the computer,
but the data was encrypted.

283
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:16,121
Came up with this
roster and what I think

284
00:19:16,221 --> 00:19:17,990
are some financial
reports for the Northern

285
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:20,526
California Committee.

286
00:19:20,626 --> 00:19:24,062
I think your people can
probably do something with this.

287
00:19:24,162 --> 00:19:26,298
I hope so.

288
00:19:26,398 --> 00:19:28,200
Listen, Frank,
we're gonna need you

289
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,902
to wear a wire
till we get a court

290
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:31,670
order to bug Carvell's office.

291
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:32,804
Forget about it.

292
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:33,939
You got the disk.

293
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:34,940
I'm done.

294
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,309
I'm through.

295
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:38,477
I'll call you.

296
00:19:43,382 --> 00:19:46,852
[music playing]

297
00:20:19,217 --> 00:20:22,688
[phone ringing]

298
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:26,858
FITZPATRICK (ON
MACHINE): Fitzpatrick.

299
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:27,793
Leave a message.

300
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:28,594

301
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:30,329
FRANK: Hey, Fitz, it's Jennings.

302
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:31,263
Give me a call, will you?

303
00:20:31,363 --> 00:20:32,264
It's important.

304
00:20:32,364 --> 00:20:35,434

305
00:20:57,122 --> 00:20:58,256
Oh, my god.

306
00:20:58,357 --> 00:21:00,592
I'm dying.

307
00:21:00,692 --> 00:21:02,394
How 'bout a saucer of milk
for my little sex kitten?

308
00:21:02,494 --> 00:21:06,098
Uh, how 'bout a double
orange juice in the shower?

309
00:21:06,198 --> 00:21:07,666
Mmm, OK.

310
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:10,669

[music playing]

313
00:22:38,056 --> 00:22:39,358
Got a problem.

314
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:40,759
Frank Jennings
was in your office

315
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:43,762
last night accessing
information.

316
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:48,600
- Are you sure?
- Our FBI source confirmed it.

317
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,736
Well, you'd better find
out what he was looking for.

318
00:23:05,283 --> 00:23:07,586
What the hell happened here?

319
00:23:07,686 --> 00:23:11,056
You accessed some of
our confidential files.

320
00:23:11,156 --> 00:23:12,124
I want you to tell me about it.

321
00:23:14,693 --> 00:23:16,094
Well, I didn't do it.

322
00:23:16,194 --> 00:23:17,262
You got it all wrong.

323
00:23:17,362 --> 00:23:18,296
Oh, no, no.

324
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:19,631
No, see, you got it all wrong.

325
00:23:26,471 --> 00:23:28,340
Oh, goddamn it!

326
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:31,910
[music playing]

327
00:23:48,627 --> 00:23:50,095
Come on, Frank.

328
00:23:50,195 --> 00:23:51,263
Look, there's nowhere to go.

329
00:23:51,363 --> 00:23:52,264

all the lobby exits.

Seal off the garage.

MAN: I'm on 13 and descending.

I don't see him.

342
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:34,072
MATT (ON RADIO): He
must be going up.

343
00:24:34,172 --> 00:24:35,407
Get after him!

345
00:24:41,613 --> 00:24:43,114
Security base,
this is security one.

346
00:24:43,215 --> 00:24:44,416
Over.

347
00:24:44,516 --> 00:24:46,718
MAN: He's in the south
stairwell going up.

348
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:48,920

let him out of here.

00:26:12,971 --> 00:26:15,073

[music playing]

352
00:26:24,549 --> 00:26:26,818
That's the guy!

353
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:29,020
We got him cornered on the roof.

354

[music playing]

355
00:26:38,496 --> 00:26:40,999
This is not good.

356
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:42,000
It's not good.

357
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,401
Oh, shit!

00:26:43,501 --> 00:26:46,972
[music playing]

359
00:27:18,003 --> 00:27:20,205
Aidan?

360
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:21,106
We've got trouble.

361
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:27,812
You're making a big mistake.

362
00:27:27,912 --> 00:27:28,813
What's going on?

363
00:27:28,913 --> 00:27:30,015
Why have you been arrested?

364
00:27:30,115 --> 00:27:31,850
Like two of our
illustrious forefathers,

365
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:35,387
Washington and Jefferson,
I've been unjustly accused.

00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:38,757
But our constitution
assures my imminent freedom.

367
00:27:38,857 --> 00:27:40,825
So please go back to work.

368
00:27:40,925 --> 00:27:45,230
We're gonna need every penny
to pay for these lawyers.

369
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:46,931
MAN (ON RADIO): You're
on with City Talk.

370
00:27:47,032 --> 00:27:49,300
MAN (ON RADIO): The charges
against Carvell are crazy.

371
00:27:49,401 --> 00:27:51,269
I wouldn't be surprised to
find out the whole thing

372
00:27:51,369 --> 00:27:52,804
was a setup by the CIA.

373
00:27:52,904 --> 00:27:54,939
WOMAN (ON RADIO): The American
people are behind Carvell.

374
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,274
He fights for the
working class--

375
00:27:56,374 --> 00:27:57,776
MAN (ON RADIO): Carvell
would run the country

376
00:27:57,876 --> 00:27:59,210
the way it should be run.

377
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:00,445
WOMAN (ON RADIO): Polls
say Carvell lost 10 points.

378
00:28:00,545 --> 00:28:01,713
I don't believe it.

379
00:28:01,813 --> 00:28:03,281
They tell us what
they want us to here.

380
00:28:03,381 --> 00:28:05,150
MAN (ON RADIO): Maybe Frank
Jennings is telling the truth.

381
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:06,951
Maybe some of this stuff
about Carvell is true.

382
00:28:07,052 --> 00:28:08,086
MAN (ON RADIO): Hey, hey.

383
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:09,988
Frank Jennings is
a weak man who's

384
00:28:10,088 --> 00:28:11,289
trying to make a
name for himself

385
00:28:11,389 --> 00:28:13,825
by dragging a great
man through the gutter.

386
00:28:13,925 --> 00:28:15,727
Frank Jennings belongs in jail.

387

FRANK: You don't understand.

388
00:28:20,298 --> 00:28:22,667
This is not about a
Senate race anymore.

389
00:28:22,767 --> 00:28:24,636
Fitz and Helene are dead.

They're murdered.

391
00:28:26,571 --> 00:28:28,873
I have to testify!

392
00:28:28,973 --> 00:28:31,042
Frank, you have a
son to think about.

393
00:28:31,142 --> 00:28:34,379
I know that I have
a son to think about.

394
00:28:34,479 --> 00:28:35,613
I'm terrified.

395
00:28:35,713 --> 00:28:36,881
What's gonna happen
when you testify?

396
00:28:36,981 --> 00:28:38,783
The FBI will protect us.

397
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:40,652
Well, then why don't
you let the FBI hang him?

398
00:28:40,752 --> 00:28:42,921
Aidan Carvell is not
your responsibility!

399
00:28:43,021 --> 00:28:45,657
These people are
dead because of me!

400
00:28:45,757 --> 00:28:47,425
This is my responsibility.

401
00:28:50,995 --> 00:28:53,431
Mr. Carvell, what will
this do to your campaign?

402
00:28:53,531 --> 00:28:55,867
Will you go to jail?

403
00:28:55,967 --> 00:28:58,203
First of all, let me tell
my people from free America

404
00:28:58,303 --> 00:29:01,106
that I am absolutely innocent
of these ridiculous charges

405
00:29:01,206 --> 00:29:03,675
brought against me by
our corrupt government.

406
00:29:03,775 --> 00:29:08,213
These are evil people
trying to defame me.

407
00:29:08,313 --> 00:29:13,251
But I will not be silenced,
and the truth will be heard.

408
00:29:13,351 --> 00:29:16,921
I will fight.

409
00:29:17,021 --> 00:29:19,390
And with your help,
we all will win.

Tell me about Jennings.

this is happening.

This is turning into
a goddamn nightmare.

No, it's-- it's not
gonna be that bad.

No, it'll be like our
family no longer exists.

read the grand jury's decision?

The grand jury

charges of conspiracy

441

to commit murder and treason
against the US government.

Well done, Frank.

I think that idiot

Carvell, I want
to talk to you.

Well, Frank, you don't
have to stop believing.

Free America's still the
best thing for this country.

Yeah.

I'll assign a couple of my

be safer here, Frank.

you've been involved.

is pretty clear.

475
00:32:15,166 --> 00:32:19,203

00:36:21,913 --> 00:36:24,515
Yeah, maybe not.

546
00:36:24,615 --> 00:36:28,119
Can we stop for ice cream?

547
00:36:28,219 --> 00:36:29,253
Sure.

548
00:36:36,394 --> 00:36:37,728
Maybe we should go to
a hotel or something.

549
00:36:37,828 --> 00:36:39,664
FRANK: Oh, it was
probably nothing.

550

I'm calling Thornton.

561
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,735
RANDY: You want
chocolate sauce, Dad?

00:37:17,835 --> 00:37:18,669
Yeah, sure.

563
00:37:21,272 --> 00:37:23,207
Uh, Thornton, this
is Jack Springer.

564
00:37:23,307 --> 00:37:24,408
I need to talk to
you immediately.

565
00:37:24,508 --> 00:37:26,577
This is an emergency.

566
00:37:26,677 --> 00:37:28,212
Well, he's
supposed to be there.

567
00:37:28,312 --> 00:37:30,781
Goddamn right he is.

568
00:37:30,881 --> 00:37:33,384
I'll page him.

569
00:37:33,484 --> 00:37:34,986
Maybe we should
call the police.

570
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:36,153
No, we just wait.

571
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:37,355
Police are just
gonna ask questions.

577
00:38:01,646 --> 00:38:04,715
Why hasn't Thornton called back?

578
00:38:04,815 --> 00:38:05,716
I don't know.

579
00:38:10,187 --> 00:38:12,657
Frank.

580
00:38:12,757 --> 00:38:14,025
All right.

581
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:14,925

what the question is.

Yeah.

668
00:46:42,666 --> 00:46:43,467
Yeah.

669
00:46:55,279 --> 00:46:57,581
I think we're
starting to overheat.

670
00:46:57,681 --> 00:46:58,816
I think it's had enough.

671
00:46:58,916 --> 00:47:03,020
Yeah, well, I
can relate to that.

672
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:04,354
Oh, I know it's not that funny.

673
00:47:04,454 --> 00:47:06,890
I just-- it's the only
emotional I have left.

674
00:47:22,506 --> 00:47:24,575
Well?

675
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:27,411
Said it's gonna take about,
uh, four hours to fix it.

676
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:29,146
Oh.

677
00:47:29,246 --> 00:47:31,448
Why don't we go find a
hotel and get some sleep, huh?

678
00:47:31,548 --> 00:47:32,850
OK, good.

679
00:47:32,950 --> 00:47:33,984
Maybe I can get a hot bath.
- Would you please?

680
00:47:34,084 --> 00:47:36,086
You need one.

Everything's gonna be OK, son.

701
00:48:53,096 --> 00:48:55,399
I'll protect us.

702
00:48:55,499 --> 00:48:58,568
I'm not gonna let
anybody hurt you.

00:48:58,669 --> 00:49:01,571
OK, come on, now.

704
00:49:01,672 --> 00:49:03,941

That's it.

707
00:49:08,645 --> 00:49:09,513
I'm not going anywhere.

708
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:11,515
I'm gonna be right here.

Thornton's here.

726

He saw the car.

727
00:51:06,563 --> 00:51:07,297
All right.

728
00:51:07,397 --> 00:51:08,632
He should have been here by now.

729
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:09,566
Take Richards.

730
00:51:09,666 --> 00:51:11,368
Check the bus depot.

out the motels.

00:51:16,606 --> 00:51:17,441
Go.

735
00:51:19,376 --> 00:51:20,610
All right.
OK.

736
00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:21,545
We'll wait here.

737
00:51:21,645 --> 00:51:22,813
Just hurry.

738
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:25,415
They're sending
some agents over.

739
00:51:25,515 --> 00:51:27,417
How do we know
we can trust 'em?

740
00:51:27,517 --> 00:51:29,786
We don't.

741
00:51:29,886 --> 00:51:31,154
I'll get Randy up.

We've got to go.

OK, you ready?

All right, now.

Well, you said you
wanted a bigger car.

753
00:52:35,085 --> 00:52:35,919
Let's go.

754
00:52:36,019 --> 00:52:37,921
Turn around!

00:52:38,021 --> 00:52:40,690
Let's go back and
join the party.

look, we're gonna

757

do exactly what he says, OK?

758
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:50,800
Get to the bus!

759
00:53:15,025 --> 00:53:15,926

Let's go.

00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:16,860

Go, go.

767
00:53:38,648 --> 00:53:40,283
You've been a good
friend to Free America.

768
00:53:40,383 --> 00:53:43,587
Mmm, but, uh, who's gonna
pay for the broken door?

769
00:53:43,687 --> 00:53:45,889
Well, you've got
the account number.

770
00:53:45,989 --> 00:53:47,190
Use it.

771
00:53:47,290 --> 00:53:48,391
Put this on there, too.

772
00:53:52,062 --> 00:53:53,363
What do you got?

773
00:53:53,463 --> 00:53:54,931
They've stolen a bus, and
they're headed down 128.

774
00:53:55,031 --> 00:53:56,132
A bus.

775
00:53:56,232 --> 00:53:59,102
Very creative.

776
00:53:59,202 --> 00:54:00,203
Are they following us?

Not yet.

778
00:54:05,375 --> 00:54:06,276
OK, I got him.

779
00:54:06,376 --> 00:54:07,277
He's heading through the city.

could just reach out,

01:03:40,516 --> 01:03:43,352

start getting ready for school.

I'm not gonna testify.

Randy out of here.

And you think Carvell's
just gonna leave us alone?

When he knows I'm not
gonna testify, yeah.

He'll-- he'll leave us alone.

This isn't about whether
you testify or not.

defection personally.

He's not gonna back down now.

have to testify.

to tell the truth

and nothing but the
truth in this matter

Uh, Mr. Carvell.

904
01:05:34,497 --> 01:05:36,198
Mr. Carvell, it
would seem that Frank

905
01:05:36,299 --> 01:05:38,968
Jennings's testimony today was
a very damaging moment for you.

906
01:05:39,068 --> 01:05:40,970
The-- the government
really scored big.

907
01:05:41,070 --> 01:05:42,104
Any comment on that?

908
01:05:42,204 --> 01:05:43,172
Frank Jennings
is a pathetic man.

909
01:05:43,272 --> 01:05:44,340
- You think so?
- Oh, yes.

910
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:46,309
I fell for his
false credibility.

911
01:05:46,409 --> 01:05:49,612
But I can assure you that the
government's plot to defame me

912
01:05:49,712 --> 01:05:50,913
is coming apart at the seams.

913
01:05:51,013 --> 01:05:52,615
But more important than
me are these people

914
01:05:52,715 --> 01:05:55,351
who come out to support me
and their great country.

915
01:05:55,451 --> 01:05:56,452

01:05:56,552 --> 01:05:57,353

So you think you
have a chance, hey?

920
01:06:03,059 --> 01:06:05,227
Uh, this man has confidence
that never stops,

921
01:06:05,328 --> 01:06:06,696
no matter what goes on.

922
01:06:06,796 --> 01:06:09,398
I mean, despite Judge
Bamber's surprise ruling today

923
01:06:09,498 --> 01:06:11,667
not to allow the computer
records into evidence

924
01:06:11,767 --> 01:06:14,970
on a technicality, it sure
seems that the prosecution's

925
01:06:15,071 --> 01:06:16,605
case is stronger than ever.

926
01:06:16,706 --> 01:06:20,609
And a conviction seems
very, very likely.

927
01:06:20,710 --> 01:06:21,544
All rise.

928
01:06:29,752 --> 01:06:33,622
Will the defendant please
rise and face the bench?

929
01:06:38,561 --> 01:06:43,165
To the charge of
conspiring to commit murder

930
01:06:43,265 --> 01:06:46,669
and to the charge of
treason against the United

931
01:06:46,769 --> 01:06:53,442
States of America, the
defendant is found not guilty.

932
01:06:53,542 --> 01:06:54,810
[cheering]

933
01:06:54,910 --> 01:06:55,745
No.

934
01:07:01,083 --> 01:07:04,653
Court is adjourned.

935
01:07:04,754 --> 01:07:06,021
Best defense money could buy.

936
01:07:06,122 --> 01:07:09,225
[music playing]

937
01:07:11,694 --> 01:07:13,596
What the hell happened?

938
01:07:13,696 --> 01:07:14,563
We just got decked.

939
01:07:14,663 --> 01:07:16,432
We had a lock on a conviction.
Ah.

940
01:07:16,532 --> 01:07:17,166
Mr. Carvell.

941
01:07:17,266 --> 01:07:18,567
Mr. Carvell, you, uh--

942
01:07:18,667 --> 01:07:20,002
you are obviously very
pleased with this verdict.

943
01:07:20,102 --> 01:07:21,237
Does this mean you're
going to continue

944
01:07:21,337 --> 01:07:22,571
your campaign for the Senate?

945
01:07:22,671 --> 01:07:23,806
Yes, I'm very pleased.

946
01:07:23,906 --> 01:07:26,675
And yes, yes, yes, I'm going
to continue my campaign.

947
01:07:26,776 --> 01:07:30,312
I have felt the iron fist
of out-of-control officials

948
01:07:30,413 --> 01:07:32,148
who think that once
elected, they don't

949
01:07:32,248 --> 01:07:33,115
have to answer to the people.

950
01:07:33,215 --> 01:07:34,450
I say that's wrong.

951
01:07:34,550 --> 01:07:38,788
I say free America, then
live in a free America.

952
01:07:38,888 --> 01:07:40,790
That sick bastard.

953
01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:44,059
I think I'm gonna puke.

954
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:45,094
Thank you.

955
01:07:45,194 --> 01:07:46,061
Oh, Frank.

956
01:07:46,162 --> 01:07:47,363
Isn't it amazing?

957
01:07:47,463 --> 01:07:48,631
I mean how justice works?

958
01:07:48,731 --> 01:07:50,132
Who'd have thought?

959
01:07:50,232 --> 01:07:53,436
Frank, I'm sorry
about your family.

960
01:07:53,536 --> 01:07:56,172
But hey, things will get worse.

961
01:08:01,510 --> 01:08:04,580
AGENT LUCKENBILL: The DA
thinks the judge took a dive.

962
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:05,514
How sure is he?

963
01:08:05,614 --> 01:08:06,649
Oh, he's sure.

964
01:08:06,749 --> 01:08:09,084
He's convinced Bamber
is on Carvell's payroll.

965
01:08:09,185 --> 01:08:10,386
Damn it.

966
01:08:10,486 --> 01:08:11,954
I put everything on
the line for you guys,

967
01:08:12,054 --> 01:08:14,123
and you come up with
a crooked judge.

968
01:08:14,223 --> 01:08:16,492
Frank, everything
remains the same.

969
01:08:16,592 --> 01:08:17,293
We have a deal.

970
01:08:17,393 --> 01:08:18,794
We'll take care of you.

971
01:08:18,894 --> 01:08:20,963
Yeah, what, like maybe, uh,
another witness protection

972
01:08:21,063 --> 01:08:22,264
program?

973
01:08:22,364 --> 01:08:23,999
We're opening a new
investigation, Frank.

974
01:08:24,099 --> 01:08:26,168
We're prepared to
go the distance.

975
01:08:26,268 --> 01:08:27,503
Carvell will go to jail.

976
01:08:27,603 --> 01:08:28,537
Yeah.

977
01:08:28,637 --> 01:08:30,473
You know, you guys
are so full of shit.

978
01:08:33,909 --> 01:08:36,178
You're right Carvell is crazed.

979
01:08:36,278 --> 01:08:39,215
He won't stop.

980
01:08:39,315 --> 01:08:41,383
I'm gonna sell all the stocks,
clear the bank accounts,

981
01:08:41,484 --> 01:08:42,618
get our passports in order--

982
01:08:42,718 --> 01:08:43,486
What?

983
01:08:43,586 --> 01:08:46,355
Just listen to
me for a second.

984
01:08:46,455 --> 01:08:50,092
As soon as Randy's
well, we're leaving.

985
01:08:50,192 --> 01:08:51,193
We're leaving the country.

986
01:08:54,263 --> 01:08:55,798
Oh, you can't do
anything to that man.

987
01:08:55,898 --> 01:08:56,699
You know that, Frank.

988
01:08:56,799 --> 01:08:59,101
Tell me you know that.

989
01:08:59,201 --> 01:09:02,738
Anne, I'm just going
to get our money.

990
01:09:02,838 --> 01:09:04,039
Oh, no.

991
01:09:04,139 --> 01:09:05,140
No, no, no, no.

992
01:09:05,241 --> 01:09:06,408
I know you.

993
01:09:06,509 --> 01:09:07,543
You're up to something.
- All right, look.

994
01:09:07,643 --> 01:09:09,144
I don't have time
for this again.

995
01:09:09,245 --> 01:09:10,913
I'm meeting with the stock
broker in 20 minutes.

996
01:09:11,013 --> 01:09:12,414
I love you.

997
01:09:12,515 --> 01:09:13,716
- Frank--
- I love you.

998
01:09:13,816 --> 01:09:14,650
Frank.

999
01:09:40,042 --> 01:09:43,946
I called about putting
together some packages for me.

1000
01:09:44,046 --> 01:09:44,847
Target?

1001
01:09:47,850 --> 01:09:49,251
12,000 square foot house.

1002
01:09:49,351 --> 01:09:50,853
I'm gonna need 'em by 6:00 PM.

1003
01:09:50,953 --> 01:09:52,288
Uh, sorry, partner.

1004
01:09:52,388 --> 01:09:56,091
Uh, I can't hear you unless
you're looking at me.

1005
01:09:56,191 --> 01:09:58,394
I said I'm gonna
need them by 6:00 PM.

1006
01:10:01,730 --> 01:10:03,032
Cash on delivery.

1007
01:10:03,132 --> 01:10:06,068
$10,000.

1008
01:10:06,168 --> 01:10:06,969
OK.

1009
01:10:10,072 --> 01:10:14,510
Hey, uh, where's the party?

1010
01:10:14,610 --> 01:10:18,013
Maybe I could come
along and help you out.

1011
01:10:20,549 --> 01:10:22,851
Maybe next time, huh?

1012
01:10:22,952 --> 01:10:24,219
Next time.

1013

1014
01:10:51,380 --> 01:10:52,982

requested of the Northern

1015
01:10:53,082 --> 01:10:54,283
California Committee.

1016
01:10:54,383 --> 01:10:57,553
As you can see, the
money's been well spent.

1017
01:10:57,653 --> 01:10:59,588
I'll be sending you tapes
of the Minnesota and Alabama

1018
01:10:59,688 --> 01:11:01,190

01:11:18,407 --> 01:11:20,042
They're looking good.

1021
01:11:20,142 --> 01:11:20,943
Yeah.

1022
01:11:25,414 --> 01:11:26,849
So talk to me.

1023
01:11:26,949 --> 01:11:29,952
Our friend sold his stock
and closed his bank accounts.

1024
01:11:30,052 --> 01:11:32,187
He's getting ready to run.

1025
01:11:32,288 --> 01:11:33,989
AIDAN: Do they know
where he is now?

1026
01:11:34,089 --> 01:11:35,124
MATT: No, but we'll find him.

1027
01:11:35,224 --> 01:11:36,291
It won't take long.

1028
01:11:36,392 --> 01:11:38,360
Watch his wife and kid.

1029
01:11:38,460 --> 01:11:40,262
He's not going
anywhere without them.

Questions?

01:13:00,609 --> 01:13:03,412
No, I-- I think I got it.

1035
01:13:03,512 --> 01:13:05,047
Don't get cocky.

1036
01:13:05,147 --> 01:13:08,150
These detonators are a
delicate proposition.

1037
01:13:08,250 --> 01:13:10,119
Very bad for the complexion.

1038
01:13:15,791 --> 01:13:17,059
Drink?

1039
01:13:17,159 --> 01:13:18,060
No, thanks.

1040
01:13:21,530 --> 01:13:26,468
Hey, uh, I can help out.

1041
01:13:26,568 --> 01:13:29,171
I'm a very good helper.

1042
01:13:29,271 --> 01:13:32,141

when they go boom.

01:16:19,074 --> 01:16:20,375
I'm sorry I didn't
call you earlier.

1048
01:16:20,475 --> 01:16:21,777
Things got a little hectic.

1049
01:16:21,877 --> 01:16:22,711
What's the matter?

1050
01:16:22,811 --> 01:16:24,112
You sound funny?

1051
01:16:24,212 --> 01:16:25,180
No, I'm fine.

1052
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:26,882
I just got something
caught in my throat.

1053
01:16:26,982 --> 01:16:30,852
I-- I think I'm coming down
with a cold or something.

1054
01:16:30,953 --> 01:16:32,287
I wish I could get
out of this chair

1055
01:16:32,387 --> 01:16:35,223
and make you some chicken soup.

1056
01:16:35,324 --> 01:16:36,191
You should come see Randy.

1057
01:16:36,291 --> 01:16:37,593
I think he's doing better.

1058
01:16:37,693 --> 01:16:40,295
No, I-- I think I should
stay in a hotel tonight.

1059
01:16:40,395 --> 01:16:43,432
I don't want you and Randy
catching what I have.

1060
01:16:43,532 --> 01:16:44,599
But Frank--

1061
01:16:44,700 --> 01:16:47,102
Honey, listen--

1062
01:16:47,202 --> 01:16:48,737
I want you to know
how much I love you.

1063
01:16:48,837 --> 01:16:54,009
And I want you to tell
Randy that I love him, too.

1064
01:16:54,109 --> 01:16:56,211
Frank?

1065
01:16:56,311 --> 01:16:57,279
Look, I'll, I'll, I'll--

1066
01:16:57,379 --> 01:16:58,280
I'll call you in the morning.

1067
01:16:58,380 --> 01:16:59,247

01:21:14,002 --> 01:21:16,137
We don't know what he's up to.

1099
01:21:16,238 --> 01:21:17,272
MAN: You, check the basement.

1100
01:21:17,372 --> 01:21:18,874
Archer, you check
the guest rooms.

1101
01:21:18,974 --> 01:21:19,874
You come with me.

1103
01:22:05,754 --> 01:22:07,422
We've got a problem.

1104
01:22:07,522 --> 01:22:08,823
There's a bomb in
the hall closet.

1106
01:22:13,728 --> 01:22:14,996
How much time do we have?

1107
01:22:15,096 --> 01:22:16,665
Three minutes and 12 seconds.

1108
01:22:16,765 --> 01:22:23,638
I want a man stationed out
front and a man in back in case

1109
01:22:23,738 --> 01:22:24,940
he's still in here.

1110
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:25,840
What about the chopper?

1111
01:22:25,941 --> 01:22:28,343
It's on the way.

1112
01:22:28,443 --> 01:22:29,344
Let's go.

1114
01:22:42,624 --> 01:22:46,461
Goddamn it.

1115
01:22:46,561 --> 01:22:48,263
My antiques, my house.

1116
01:22:50,899 --> 01:22:51,833
Find the son of a bitch.

1117
01:22:51,933 --> 01:22:53,501
I'll rip his fucking head off.

OK.

1140
01:30:29,357 --> 01:30:31,926
Do it.

1141
01:30:32,026 --> 01:30:32,860
Kill me.

1142
01:30:36,130 --> 01:30:41,969
That won't happen with a
man like you, a good man.

1143

You haven't got
the balls, Frank.

1144
01:30:51,879 --> 01:30:55,149
You lose.

1145
01:30:55,249 --> 01:30:56,150
I win.

1146
01:30:59,253 --> 01:31:00,488

Oh, Randy.

01:32:33,714 --> 01:32:35,616
Oh, Randy.

01:32:35,716 --> 01:32:38,286
Hi, duck.

1155
01:32:38,386 --> 01:32:39,186
Quack.

01:32:45,293 --> 01:32:46,193
That's my boy.

1157
01:32:51,832 --> 01:32:53,167
The Justice
Department officially

1158
01:32:53,267 --> 01:32:56,037
closed the case on the Aidan
Carvell drowning today.

1159
01:32:56,137 --> 01:32:58,706
After an intensive
investigation by the FBI,

1160
01:32:58,806 --> 01:33:01,142
the death has been
declared accidental.

1161
01:33:01,242 --> 01:33:03,210
It seems that Mr. Carvell's
private helicopter

1162
01:33:03,311 --> 01:33:07,214
crashed into his own house, and
then landed in a nearby pond.
