1
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,676
Pretty windy out.

2
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:04,796
-That better not be the violent one.
-It's not, Mom.

3
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,511
Dad, look what I can do.

4
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,639
I've been practicing.

5
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,959
-Spectacular, kiddo.
-Cool.

6
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,590
You're inside out.

7
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:29,793
I knew that.
Doesn't work for you?

8
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:33,069
I can't believe you taught him that.

9
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:36,391
I didn't. He did it on his own.

10
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:40,118
-Charlie, did you brush your teeth?
-Yes.

11
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,356
-Charlie.
-I brushed them.

12
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,350
-Look at this, Con.
-Let's go. I'm serious.

13
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:49,478
You're driving me bonkers, Mom.

14
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:54,232
Remember when you said no
to buying Omnidell?

15
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,830
-Remember what the price was?
-One fifty.

16
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,432
Close. Sixty-one.

17
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,949
-I'll do it, Mom.
-No, I'll do it.

18
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,071
You know what it's going for now?

19
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,833
-Say "E. "
-E.

20
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:11,916
-Guess, Con.
-Edward, I don't know, all right?

21
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,111
-Now rinse.
-Seventy-four.

22
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,038
Really rinse. And pee.

23
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,438
Seventy-four. Should have bought it.
Shit.

24
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,469
-So buy some.
-Too late, Con. Too late.

25
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,155
Lift the seat, honey.

26
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,149
Don't forget to put it down.

27
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,710
When you finish.

28
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:44,037
-Do you really need all that stuff?
-Mom, no one wears these dorky hats.

29
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:47,596
-You do and you're not a dork.
-How do I look?

30
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,109
Very handsome.

31
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,872
Love you.
Okay, come on, let's go.

32
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,029
Come on.

33
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,874
You shouldn't go in.

34
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:04,709
I have stuff to do for the auction.
And there's a birthday soon.

35
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:08,549
Latrell Sprewell jersey, Mom.
Don't forget.

36
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:14,079
-He's on the Yankees, right?
-Mom, you're driving me bonkers.

37
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:17,192
You're driving him bonkers.

38
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,672
Jesus.

39
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,595
Taxi! Shit.

40
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,310
Taxi!

41
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,389
I'm so sorry.

42
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,355
I'm so sorry.

43
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,559
I'm sorry.

44
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,316
I'll get your things.

45
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,189
Taxi! Taxi!

46
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,992
My books.

47
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:20,033
-Could you help me get a taxi?
-Okay.

48
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,955
-I'll watch your books.
-Thanks.

49
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:47,472
-Bad day for taxis.
-It's this horrible wind.

50
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,759
Yeah, you shot down there
like a bullet!

51
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,394
If you flapped your arms,
you'd be home now.

52
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:56,472
I'll remember that next time.

53
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,914
-That's not good.
-I know.

54
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:04,631
Listen, that's me up there.
The flowerpot.

55
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,633
I'll get you a Band-Aid, okay?

56
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,557
Hold onto something.
Don't blow away.

57
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,597
Or you can come on up
and clean it off, no?

58
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,672
Come on.

59
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:26,390
I'm not an ax murderer. I promise.

60
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,389
Shit.

61
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,554
Fucking elevator.

62
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,878
One more.

63
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:14,119
-Pardon the mess.
-Are you a writer?

64
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,630
I'm a book dealer.

65
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:23,636
Bathroom's right down there,
on the left.

66
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:29,594
Go ahead. There's a medicine cabinet.

67
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:33,349
You can sneak a peek
at my prescriptions.

68
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,437
Hello?

69
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:52,754
-I made you some tea.
-Thank you.

70
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:58,590
-Do you box?
-I used to, when I was young.

71
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,069
This is an amazing place.

72
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,190
-Yeah, but it's not mine.
-No?

73
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,637
The owner is a friend, a sculptor.
He's in Paris.

74
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:14,112
That's cool.
We can stay here, me and my books.

75
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,791
Can I use your phone?
I have to call home.

76
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,514
Sure, there's a phone just behind you.

77
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,517
Thank you.

78
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,791
Gloria? Hi, it's me.

79
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:37,670
Good, good. How's Charlie?

80
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,599
Hi, honey. How was your day at school?

81
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,837
Yeah? What was the best part?

82
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:47,635
Guess what? Can you believe it?
Mommy missed her train.

83
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,519
Ice.

84
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,834
About an hour.

85
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,837
You should start your homework.

86
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:07,157
I promise to tell you all about it
when I see you. I love you. Bye.

87
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:13,515
That was my son, Charlie.
He's 8. He'll be 9 next week.

88
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:17,759
I'm Paul Martel. I'll be 28 in July.

89
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:22,432
I'm Constance.
And I'm late. I have to go.

90
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:26,709
Before you go, take a book.

91
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:31,277
No. I couldn't.

92
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:34,830
Sure you can. A souvenir.

93
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,430
Go down there. You know, like before.

94
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,437
Okay.

95
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:51,316
Keep going. Stop.

96
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,313
Now right.

97
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,636
No, right.

98
00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:00,753
Okay, now the second shelf
from the top. . .

99
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:03,639
. . .take the fourth one from the left.

100
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,717
Got it?

101
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:09,351
-Think so.
-Open to page 23.

102
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,558
Drink wine, this is life eternal

103
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:24,951
This, all that youth will give to you

104
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:29,756
It is the season for wine, roses
And drunken friends

105
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,951
Be happy for this moment

106
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:35,476
This moment is your life

107
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:47,235
I have to go. Thank you.

108
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,910
-Can you find your way out?
-I hope so.

109
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,797
That's my bedroom.

110
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,876
It was nice meeting you, Constance.

111
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:05,314
Come back if you need more books
or medical attention.

112
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,636
Hey, Glo.

113
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:49,473
-That wouldn't be the TV on, would it?
-I was just turning it off.

114
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:52,110
Sure you were.

115
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,915
-The wind knocked me down.
-Yeah?

116
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,675
You all right? You need anything?

117
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:09,077
-Gross. Were you in a fight?
-No, just fell over.

118
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,390
-Does it hurt?
-Little bit.

119
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,160
-Cool!
-Where are you going?

120
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:17,909
-To get the camera!
-Try this.

121
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:23,991
-Why do you need the camera?
-It's for school. We're doing blood.

122
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:27,397
Okay, now look like it really hurts.

123
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,556
-Ready?
-Yeah.

124
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,313
This will be great.

125
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:37,628
The wind blew her down.
She bled and everything.

126
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:41,674
-Everybody's hats blew off.
-Quite the war photographer. You okay?

127
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:44,599
Yeah. It took me down
like an old lady.

128
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:49,550
-It was humiliating.
-Dad, look at the pictures.

129
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:52,473
At least we got the evidence.
Anyone we can sue?

130
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:56,428
No. There was this nice guy
who helped me.

131
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:59,717
It was like this, Dad.
It was a twister.

132
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:04,917
Dad, look. It was like this.

133
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,196
-Wow.
-It's a tornado.

134
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:12,633
He lived around there. He got me
some Band-Aids and put me in a taxi.

135
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,876
Was he good-looking?

136
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,079
I feel sick.

137
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:24,117
-You do your homework?
-I can't. I don't know how to do it.

138
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:28,313
Come on, I'll help you.
Then you can help me with mine.

139
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,398
Did you get his name, this guy?

140
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,194
We could send him a bottle of wine.

141
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,796
Cheap wine.

142
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:54,791
Con, stand there a second.
Wait a minute.

143
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:58,790
Stay there a second.
I'm trying to figure out the. . . .

144
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:03,513
The thing I can't figure out
is the zoom-thing.

145
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:06,029
There it is.
Okay, hold on, stay there.

146
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:10,273
Got the zoomy-thingy zooming.

147
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:16,756
Stay there. I'm trying to figure
this out. I wanna see if it focuses.

148
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,277
Cool. Very cool.

149
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:26,597
So beautiful. If you only knew.

150
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:30,679
Look at you. God, what a beauty.

151
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,549
Something the matter?

152
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:47,395
Nothing. Nothing at all.

153
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:08,272
-This is really good.
-No, it isn't. Go away.

154
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:17,629
I think I'm really zooming.
I found the zoom. Found it.

155
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,796
Dad.

156
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,195
-Shit.
-Mom.

157
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:25,557
I can't sleep.

158
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:33,194
I'll be back. I'll be back.
Don't fall asleep.

159
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,589
It works.

160
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:43,874
Mom, are you nuts?
You forgot my lunch.

161
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:48,159
I did not. It's by the door.
Come with me.

162
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:51,272
-What are you chewing?
-Nothing.

163
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:54,040
Spit that out. What is that?

164
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,273
-That's lovely.
-Mom?

165
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,596
I don't want to be a dumb bunny.

166
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:06,510
Honey, it's a play. There's lots
of other bunnies. It'll be cool.

167
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,468
-You're bonkers, Mom.
-So you tell me.

168
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:12,672
-Love you.
-Love you too. What's that?

169
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,836
Thank you.

170
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,349
Bye.

171
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:24,555
Hi, this is Paul Martel. Leave
a message after the beep. Thanks.

172
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,432
Hello? Hello?

173
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,871
-Hello?
-Hello?

174
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:32,429
You're there.

175
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:36,070
This is Connie Sumner,
the one from the windy day.

176
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:38,714
Oh, that one.

177
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,551
How's the knee? Did you ice it?

178
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:45,799
Yes, I iced it and I elevated it.
You name it, I did it.

179
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:51,120
It's much better.
I just wanted to call and thank you.

180
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:53,959
I wanted your address
because I wanted...

181
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,832
-Where are you?
-What?

182
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:58,270
I said, where are you?

183
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:04,196
I'm in Grand Central.
It's really hard to hear you.

184
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,954
-Come and see me.
-What?

185
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:10,436
Yeah, take a break.
I'll make you some coffee.

186
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,597
Coffee?

187
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,949
-Okay.
-Okay.

188
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,878
See you. Bye.

189
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,632
Fuck.

190
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,553
No permanent damage, I see.

191
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:48,836
-We take Medicaid, Blue Cross. . . .
-I'm uninsured.

192
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:52,911
No. I'm afraid we don't
take charity cases.

193
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,596
It was a joke.

194
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,671
Look at this. Jack London.

195
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:14,549
First edition of White Fang,
in the original dust jacket.

196
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:17,515
And I got it for a buck fifty.

197
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:21,673
-What's it worth?
-About 4000 times more.

198
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:30,155
-Those are in French.
-I took it in school.

199
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,115
Do I want to take off something?

200
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:43,153
Your coat. Would you like
to take off your coat?

201
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,715
Yes, my coat.

202
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,037
Thank you.

203
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:59,792
But I can't stay very long.
I have some errands I have to run.

204
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:03,637
-I'll get the coffee.
-Okay.

205
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,549
-It's in Braille.
-Braille.

206
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,672
No, no, Braille.
He was French.

207
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,632
Close your eyes.

208
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:37,230
-What?
-Close your eyes.

209
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,031
My mother makes me chicken

210
00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:00,115
Her chicken makes me cough

211
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:04,039
I wish that when she made it

212
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:07,752
She took the feathers off

213
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:15,154
It doesn't say that.

214
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:26,554
-I had better go.
-Yeah?

215
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,910
I'd better go.

216
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,636
Take care. Don't fall.

217
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:40,794
-Thanks for the coffee.
-You didn't drink it.

218
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:59,317
-Lindsay, hi.
-Connie.

219
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,556
-Let me buzz him.
-Thanks.

220
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:07,954
Hey, what a surprise. Look at you.

221
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,712
-Hi, Bill.
-Hi, Connie.

222
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:12,235
-Am I interrupting?
-No, I'm leaving.

223
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:15,716
-I'll get you the budget later.
-All right, thanks.

224
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:19,310
-Would you like a coffee?
-No, thank you.

225
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,990
That's nice.

226
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,872
I didn't know
you were coming in today.

227
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,435
You're freezing.
What is that?

228
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:38,030
I was around the corner
and I brought you a present.

229
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,760
Wow. What's the occasion?

230
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:43,718
Nothing. I don't know.

231
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,310
It's a medium,
but they said it runs large.

232
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:50,837
-Look at that.
-You don't have to try it on.

233
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:54,198
I'm the boss.
I can do whatever I want.

234
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:03,312
What do you think?

235
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,235
Hold on just a second.

236
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,998
Yeah?

237
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:14,030
Okay, but hold the other calls.

238
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,352
-You're busy. I'll go.
-Sit.

239
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,590
-I'll go.
-No, sit.

240
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:22,833
Hello, Henry?
So, what is this suspension problem?

241
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:25,395
No, I never received it.

242
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:29,638
Well, get it to me.

243
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:34,591
It's not good enough. I'm sitting here
with 200 trucks I can't use.

244
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:38,588
Well, set up a meeting.
And I want Frank Birnbaum there.

245
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:43,396
Because when I tell someone
to do something, I want it done.

246
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,397
I'm sure you will.

247
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:53,038
So, what else you up to?

248
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:57,428
-Auction.
-Yeah? Who'd you hit on?

249
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:02,518
The usual suspects.

250
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,518
Who?

251
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,875
-Bob Gaylord.
-Bob?

252
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:15,553
Get Bob to pledge and they should
send you to the Middle East.

253
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:23,310
So tell me.

254
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,591
What?

255
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:30,518
What do you think?
It's a keeper.

256
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:35,879
-Hello.
-Hello.

257
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:45,112
Here I am again. I brought muffins.

258
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:02,517
-What is this music?
-Do you like it?

259
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,472
Yes.

260
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:08,678
Do you want to dance?

261
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,950
-Now?
-Yeah.

262
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,153
Okay.

263
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:22,514
-I have to warn you, I tend to lead.
-Of course. You are American.

264
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:37,072
-You've done this before.
-What?

265
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,793
How many girlfriends have you had?

266
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,592
Two.

267
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:52,032
-Really?
-Would I lie to you?

268
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:54,954
I don't know. Would you?

269
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:17,877
Your eyes are amazing. You should
never shut them, not even at night.

270
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:21,390
You should learn to sleep
with your eyes open.

271
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:27,517
-I'll work on that.
-Will you?

272
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,911
Hang on.

273
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:39,228
I think this is a mistake.

274
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:46,309
There are no mistakes. There's what
you do, and what you don't do.

275
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,395
I can't do this.

276
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:04,114
Forgot my coat.

277
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,953
-I can't.
-What?

278
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:17,275
What's wrong?

279
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:20,119
I don't know how to do this.
It's wrong.

280
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:22,396
-Hit me.
-What?

281
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,749
Hit me.

282
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,149
Hit me.

283
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,312
-Hey, Ed.
-Hey, Bob.

284
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:06,511
-Haven't seen you in a while.
-No.

285
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:10,434
-I've been working late this week.
-Really? How's the boy?

286
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,312
-It's his birthday.
-How old?

287
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:13,509
Nine.

288
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:16,360
So any major armed robberies?

289
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,949
No. No, not this week.

290
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:21,754
Speaking of which,
watch out for Connie.

291
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:25,111
-She'll have you sign over your mortgage.
-What?

292
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:28,835
-Did she try to hit on you for money?
-No.

293
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:33,636
I thought she talked to you about
this school auction, or whatever.

294
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,034
Not me.

295
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:38,232
I've been out of town.
Maybe she talked to Maggie.

296
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,709
Yeah, I guess I got it wrong.

297
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,990
Anyway, we owe you a dinner.

298
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,073
Yeah.

299
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,399
He's out.

300
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,798
Can I get you anything?

301
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,878
No. No, I'm fine, thanks.

302
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:11,238
-Tough day?
-No, not really.

303
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:16,113
What about you? How was your day?

304
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,993
It was good.

305
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:20,839
You know, the usual stuff.

306
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,550
Sure you don't want anything?

307
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,313
No.

308
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,949
-Con?
-Yeah?

309
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,275
Do you love me?

310
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:41,188
Of course I love you.

311
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,594
What a silly question.

312
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,953
I guess. . .

313
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:49,720
. . .I'm just feeling silly.

314
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:56,476
I'll be up in a minute.

315
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,592
Okay.

316
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,832
Oh, sorry.

317
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:02,191
What are we doing here?

318
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,431
Having lunch.

319
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:10,829
-I shouldn't be doing this.
-You shouldn't have lunch?

320
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:14,030
Not with you.

321
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:16,350
I think we should leave.

322
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:22,993
Listen.

323
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:26,152
See those guys over there
paying the check?

324
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:31,358
-Yes.
-Okay. If the guy on the right pays. . .

325
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:35,314
. . .we leave right now.
If the guy on the left pays. . .

326
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:37,312
. . .we stay.

327
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,391
And I kiss you.

328
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,632
No.

329
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:52,478
Give me that.

330
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:56,433
I win.

331
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,354
-No.
-C'est la vie.

332
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:05,638
Don't do it. Don't.

333
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:20,078
-Room for two?
-Of course.

334
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:58,199
Nice music. What is it?

335
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:01,711
It's. . .

336
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:04,474
. . .African, I think.

337
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,478
I like it.

338
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:34,593
Here.

339
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:07,310
Let's go to bed.

340
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,875
-Come on.
-Stay here with me.

341
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:12,435
-I'm cold.
-Stay.

342
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:19,548
-Stay here with me.
-I'm cold.

343
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:21,554
Let's go.

344
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:49,877
How about lunch today?

345
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:51,832
You free?

346
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:55,829
I have all this fundraiser stuff.
Auction things to pick up.

347
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:59,589
We can do an early one if you want.
How about 1 2:00?

348
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:01,392
1 2:00?

349
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:02,549
Yeah.

350
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:08,715
Will I be hungry at 1 2:00?

351
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:17,838
We could go in together.

352
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:19,837
I'll wait for you.

353
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:25,438
-I won't be ready for another hour.
-That's all right. I'll wait.

354
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:40,432
-Oh, shit.
-What?

355
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:42,352
I just remembered. . .

356
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:47,515
. . .I have a facial at 1 2:30
at Georgianna's today.

357
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:49,839
Oh, well.

358
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:53,629
You gotta stay beautiful, right?

359
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:59,830
Georgianna's, huh?

360
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:03,313
Waste of money.

361
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:22,317
Yeah, Manhattan.

362
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:26,470
A beauty salon called Georgina.

363
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:31,870
Oh, yeah, right. Yes, Georgianna's.
That's right.

364
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:35,393
Thank you.

365
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:46,351
Hello, I'm calling to confirm
an appointment today at 1 2:30.

366
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:49,030
Sumner. Connie Sumner.

367
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:50,912
S-U-M-N-E-R.

368
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:59,592
Could she be down for another time?

369
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:05,952
No, thank you.

370
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,752
Connie?
It's Connie.

371
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:30,359
Connie?

372
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:32,754
Tracy?

373
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:35,718
-Hi. I was gonna call you.
-They all say that. . .

374
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:40,152
. . .when I call about bunny costumes.
You know Sally from Planned Parenthood.

375
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:42,390
-Hi. It's been a while.
-Too long.

376
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:45,308
-You look amazing.
-So where you headed?

377
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:49,638
I was going to look for some
window shades for the kitchen.

378
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:53,515
We're gonna go and have coffee.
Why don't you join us?

379
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:57,395
-Oh, I'm gonna be late.
-For window shades?

380
00:47:58,040 --> 00:48:00,429
-Come on.
-Okay.

381
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:07,950
Hi, how are you?

382
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:15,950
I'm just gonna make a phone call.

383
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:18,509
-Sure.
-Let me get that for you.

384
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:22,711
-She could've used my cell phone.
-Oh, you're right.

385
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:27,392
Hi, it's me.

386
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:31,639
You won't believe this.
I'm at that café around the corner.

387
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:35,799
Why do you introduce me
as Sally from Planned Parenthood?

388
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,878
It makes it sound like
I'm handing out condoms.

389
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:41,356
I'm stuck here.

390
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:45,232
Will you wait for me?

391
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:46,754
Wait for me.

392
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:55,719
I called Gloria to remind her
to pick up the dry cleaning.

393
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:00,829
Charlie is so adorable.

394
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:02,519
Thank you.

395
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:20,316
I can't eat.

396
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:25,994
-I'll have a coffee.
-Well, I guess I'll have coffee too.

397
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:29,559
Excuse me again. Ladies' room.

398
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:34,518
God, she looks good.

399
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:38,753
-You think she's had work?
-Why would she? She's still gorgeous.

400
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:41,793
They do it early now
before it goes to shit.

401
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:59,633
I have friends out there.

402
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:08,109
You take me to the best places.

403
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:11,513
Let me.

404
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:19,468
-She's not like that. She's really nice.
-Of course she is.

405
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:22,837
That makes it worse.
She's nice and she's sweet.

406
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:26,515
And her ass is in exactly
the same place it was in college.

407
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:34,518
Are you taking tennis?

408
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:38,474
Oh, I wouldn't call what I do
"taking tennis. "

409
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:45,073
-There you are. I was starting to worry.
-No, I'm fine.

410
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:47,959
We thought that heartthrob
abducted you.

411
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:50,029
What heartthrob?

412
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:54,229
You didn't see him at the counter?
He was gorgeous.

413
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,878
-I miss everything.
-Your button's undone.

414
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:00,315
Oh. Thank you.

415
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:06,792
That's him.

416
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,513
I can see the appeal.

417
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:19,393
If he looked at me twice,
I'd be on my back.

418
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:21,875
-You would not.
-I would so. Why not?

419
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:24,753
A couple of reasons:
Adam and your kids.

420
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:27,913
You know, Trace,
they wouldn't have to know.

421
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:32,910
It could be something I did for myself,
to broaden my horizons.

422
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:34,991
Like taking a pottery class.

423
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:38,477
-An affair isn't like taking pottery.
-Could be.

424
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:42,389
It would start out like that.
Then something would happen. . .

425
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:47,799
. . .someone finds out or someone
falls in love and it ends disastrously.

426
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:51,634
They always end disastrously.

427
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:04,398
No.

428
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:06,193
When?

429
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:08,990
It was a long time ago.

430
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:13,239
And it's the one thing in my life
I would undo if I could.

431
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:23,473
Did you just fuck me
across the street?

432
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:25,875
I did.

433
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:30,031
We could end this now
and no one would get hurt.

434
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:35,189
Yeah. I think if we ended this now,
I'd get hurt.

435
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:40,917
-So no matter what, someone gets hurt?
-Maybe not.

436
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:43,719
Maybe we'll get tired of each other.

437
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:46,593
God, I hope I get tired of you.

438
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:52,630
You're in my mind.

439
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:57,789
You're the only thing in my mind
when I wake up every morning.

440
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:02,117
You're in my brain
before I even open my eyes.

441
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:05,073
-What do you think of?
-That depends.

442
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:10,189
If it's a day when I don't know if I'm
gonna get to see you, I'm anxious. . .

443
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:13,750
. . .thinking of excuses to come to
the city to see you.

444
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:19,790
And the days you know we'll meet?

445
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:21,712
On those days. . .

446
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:24,119
. . .I'm. . .

447
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:28,196
. . .calm and hating myself.

448
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:40,634
This is what we have over here.

449
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:43,514
I'll have it ready for you
this afternoon.

450
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:49,913
Ed, what's up? Sounded important.

451
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:55,636
I've heard you're talking with
Dunbar and Brinks and other companies.

452
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:57,558
Where did you hear that?

453
00:53:58,640 --> 00:53:59,959
Well, look.

454
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:04,073
I suppose they could be wooing me,
if that's what you mean.

455
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:08,592
Apparently a lot of people
are wooing you. Or who's wooing who?

456
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:12,595
What are you talking about?
So I talked to some people.

457
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:15,473
-So what?
-This is about loyalty, Bill.

458
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:20,911
I'm letting you go. You'll have
my recommendation if you need it.

459
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:25,391
I have a family, Ed.

460
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:28,189
You had a family here.

461
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:32,279
No, wait a minute.
You're telling me about family?

462
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:36,150
You don't know the first
goddamn thing about it.

463
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:43,000
Look at your own fucking family, Ed.

464
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:45,833
Take a goddamn look at that.

465
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:05,631
-Ed.
-Frank.

466
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:10,793
Thanks for coming on such short notice.

467
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:13,640
This is personal, it's not business.

468
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:17,630
Think about it.
You might not want to get involved.

469
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:19,956
But I need someone I can trust.

470
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:22,509
I want you to follow somebody.

471
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:27,837
I want you to follow my wife.
