Carsen and Mikey were roughing up

177

This dude,
he just lives there. He...

180
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:33,031
He come around
and he fucked up Tony.

181
00:15:33,033 --> 00:15:35,166

Shoved Mikey's knife up his throat.

187

Mikey's dead too... asphyxiated.

188

00:15:59,591 --> 00:16:01,159
What about Tony?

190

He'll make it.

191
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:05,063
One of his testicles got
crushed and infected,

192
00:16:05,065 --> 00:16:06,998

You gotta cut off his balls, too.

195

Yeah, he lived two doors down

Excuse me. Detective Mitchell.

352
00:26:59,752 --> 00:27:01,118
- Yes sir?
- Got a minute?

353
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,353
Yes, I do.

354
00:27:02,355 --> 00:27:04,254
So are you staying in this place?

355
00:27:04,256 --> 00:27:06,390
Yes sir, in 205.

356

- John nguyen.
- John.

357
00:27:07,994 --> 00:27:09,093
Can I inspect some I.D.?

358
00:27:16,668 --> 00:27:18,135
That's a different address.

359
00:27:18,137 --> 00:27:19,670
It's my parents.

360
00:27:19,672 --> 00:27:21,805

- Military?
- Yes sir. Army.

362
00:27:23,976 --> 00:27:26,644
Kind of figured that.

- Thank you for your service.
- Of course.

364

I don't mean to pry, but I'm
just trying to figure out

365

what the hell you're doing here.

366
00:27:33,753 --> 00:27:35,319
It's just temporary.

367
00:27:35,321 --> 00:27:40,124
Well, not for nothing,
but it's kind of a bad place.

368

369

370
00:27:46,064 --> 00:27:48,899
Eh, just a couple of scumbags
wasting taxpayers' money.

371

- All right.

- You?
- Nothing like that.

Nothing like what?

387
00:28:34,813 --> 00:28:36,447
You see, he's starting this

388
00:28:36,449 --> 00:28:39,817
- video production company.
- Let me see if I remember:

389
00:28:39,819 --> 00:28:42,786
He's starting this
production company.

390
00:28:42,788 --> 00:28:45,389

copyrighted and everything.

391

Hmm? He's gonna
make you the big star.

392
00:28:47,727 --> 00:28:50,461
You'll make, like, six figures

out, show 'em a good time,

they tip really really well.

398
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:03,140
And it'll get the company
up and running.

399
00:29:03,142 --> 00:29:05,809
Is that about right?

rusted pickup truck

00:36:19,378 --> 00:36:21,211
If I knew,

524
00:36:21,213 --> 00:36:23,947
I wouldn't be standing here.

525
00:36:23,949 --> 00:36:25,749
Yeah.

526
00:36:25,751 --> 00:36:27,851
But you know something.

527
00:36:27,853 --> 00:36:29,853
Like what?

528
00:36:29,855 --> 00:36:31,855
Like what kind of shit
are you mixed up in?

529
00:36:31,857 --> 00:36:34,357
Who'd have a reason
to do something like this?

530
00:36:36,294 --> 00:36:38,762
What makes you think I know?

531
00:36:38,764 --> 00:36:42,365
That look on your
face, your reaction.

532
00:36:43,768 --> 00:36:46,269
You think this is the first
time I've seen a burned body?

533
00:36:46,271 --> 00:36:48,838
No. But this is your family.

534
00:36:53,911 --> 00:36:56,413
Where were you night before last?

535
00:36:56,415 --> 00:36:58,248
At my friend's place.

536
00:36:58,250 --> 00:36:59,783
Had a couple of drinks,

537
00:36:59,785 --> 00:37:02,452
couldn't drive. I told you.

538
00:37:03,854 --> 00:37:05,822
Am I a suspect?

539
00:37:05,824 --> 00:37:07,524
No, not yet.

540
00:37:08,826 --> 00:37:11,628
Don't walk away, John.
I'm trying to help you here.

541
00:37:14,966 --> 00:37:16,433
Help?

542
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:19,302
What help can you give me?

543
00:37:22,873 --> 00:37:25,342
Come on, kid. You gotta talk to me.

544
00:37:26,477 --> 00:37:27,811
Johnny, come on.

00:37:27,813 --> 00:37:29,546

your dad's workbench.</i>

00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:40,357
<i>I need his shotgun too.</i>

548
00:37:40,359 --> 00:37:43,260
John, get a grip. This ain't
the time to do dumbass shit.

549
00:37:47,999 --> 00:37:51,301
<i>You need to step off and
think right now, John.</i>

550
00:37:53,838 --> 00:37:55,805
<i>You got cops here.</i>
<i>Real cops</i>

551

554
00:38:01,613 --> 00:38:03,580
I need that shotgun.

555

<i>That ain't gonna bring 'em back.</i>

556
00:38:12,024 --> 00:38:13,790
John: <i>What do you

557
00:38:13,792 --> 00:38:15,425

- Farragut: <i>Yeah. (Laughs)</i>

They'll burn a family alive,

- (Farragut laughs) Yeah.
- No kidding.

578
00:39:45,851 --> 00:39:48,451
Looks like the intruder blasted
his way right in here.

579
00:39:48,453 --> 00:39:50,487
Clever son of a bitch
loaded a 12-gauge shell up

Don't shoot. (Sobbing)

Looks like he, uh,
caught up with our man here

while he was watching TV...
Homemade kiddie porn.

593
00:40:25,123 --> 00:40:26,689
Little boy, about eight.

594
00:40:26,691 --> 00:40:28,792
That's some fucked-up

595

I say, I don't pay for this.

No no no. I know it's wrong.

Bang, hit Schlinger

This whole thing is
loaded with rock salt.

The shit went right
through the cushions.

All right, so our guy's got a plan.

specialized round for the target.

Why you got me tied up?

621

Why'd you fuckin' shoot me, man?

dump him in a car, drive off.

- So we got a witness?
- No.

632
00:41:57,849 --> 00:41:59,549
Couldn't see the perp.

633
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:02,185

- Car?

So you in business with Hollis now.

703
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:02,765
So are you.

704
00:45:03,801 --> 00:45:05,802
That's a bad habit.

705
00:45:05,804 --> 00:45:08,337
And I don't allow
smoking in my car.

706
00:45:08,339 --> 00:45:11,007
Oh, it's your car now.

707
00:45:11,009 --> 00:45:14,477
Well, I just deposited
200 gs on the backseat

708
00:45:14,479 --> 00:45:16,746
for the drugs in the trunk.

709
00:45:16,748 --> 00:45:18,981
So, yeah, I think
that makes it mine.

710
00:45:21,852 --> 00:45:25,288
There are no drugs
in the trunk, <i>Inglaterra.</i>

(Magic laughs)

712
00:45:27,759 --> 00:45:30,727
Did I ever tell you I had
a cat named magic once?

713
00:45:31,895 --> 00:45:34,464
And it was a pussy too,
just like you.

714
00:45:36,467 --> 00:45:39,435
Maybe you don't
understand American.

715
00:45:39,437 --> 00:45:41,804
I'm the last thing
you're ever going to see.

716
00:45:43,006 --> 00:45:44,741
Well, that's depressing.

717
00:45:46,777 --> 00:45:48,845
- I'm going to keep the money.

718
00:45:48,847 --> 00:45:50,780
Yeah.

720
00:45:53,784 --> 00:45:54,917

Whoa, easy easy. Calmate, bro.

722
00:45:56,921 --> 00:45:59,322
Now I'll put that down
to stupidity.

723
00:45:59,324 --> 00:46:02,024
Now, you listen

You back off.

725

And you start walking
down that street.

Okay, <i>calmate, calmate,</i> brother.

We still friends?

731
00:46:18,776 --> 00:46:20,076
All right.

732
00:46:20,078 --> 00:46:22,078
(Speaks Spanish)
I'll catch you on the flipside.

733

- Yeah, you will, yeah.

You've just broken a deal.

735

I'm taking me business elsewhere!

736
00:46:27,852 --> 00:46:29,252

You'll let me go after this, right?
If I do you right?

744
00:47:07,292 --> 00:47:10,092
Maybe your friend might have
some fucking painkillers too.

1048
01:07:14,798 --> 01:07:17,065
Yeah, I need those painkillers.

1049
01:07:17,067 --> 01:07:18,951
You're gonna need it a
little bit more after this.

1050
01:07:18,977 --> 01:07:19,801
Oh fuck fuck fuck.

1051
01:07:19,803 --> 01:07:22,637
- All right, hold your breath.
- (Moans) Motherfucker.

1052

I think soldier boy's
hit our supply lines.

1061
01:08:32,708 --> 01:08:34,542

1065
01:09:37,740 --> 01:09:40,275
- I can't, man.
- Your mom can.

1066
01:09:40,277 --> 01:09:42,210
And if she gets fired?

1067
01:09:42,212 --> 01:09:43,912
How's she gonna get fired?

1068

1069
01:09:46,716 --> 01:09:48,816
Dude, this is mad fucking illegal.

1070
01:09:48,818 --> 01:09:50,498
And you're out there
killing motherfuckers.

1071
01:09:50,512 --> 01:09:51,586
Just get me the address.

1072
01:09:51,588 --> 01:09:53,521
Dude, it's her job.

1073
01:09:59,228 --> 01:10:00,929
It's my family.

1074
01:10:00,931 --> 01:10:03,264
They burned them alive.

1075
01:10:08,637 --> 01:10:11,506
It's fucked up, I know,

1076
01:10:11,508 --> 01:10:14,309
but we can't keep doing this shit.

1077
01:10:14,311 --> 01:10:16,311
You know what's fucked up?

1078
01:10:16,313 --> 01:10:19,614
The fact that you're not doing
everything that you could to help me.

1079
01:10:19,616 --> 01:10:22,450
John, this is insane. This
is the real fucking world.

1080
01:10:22,452 --> 01:10:25,320
- This ain't Afghanistan.
- What happened to you?

1081
01:10:25,322 --> 01:10:27,488
You lose your leg
and your nutsack too?

1082
01:10:28,457 --> 01:10:30,658
- Fuck you, man!
- Help me.

1083
01:10:33,395 --> 01:10:35,296
I'll get you your damn address.

1084
01:10:35,298 --> 01:10:37,966
Forget the address!
Let's get these guys!

1085
01:10:37,968 --> 01:10:41,436
What the fuck is my
handicapped ass gonna do?

1086
01:10:41,438 --> 01:10:43,771
What are you gonna do? Play games
for the rest of your life?

1087
01:10:43,773 --> 01:10:45,640
- What do you care?
- I care.

1088
01:10:47,309 --> 01:10:48,943
And I only trust you.

1089
01:10:48,945 --> 01:10:51,312
I'll get you the address,

1090
01:10:51,314 --> 01:10:52,981
but why can't you understand

1091
01:10:52,983 --> 01:10:55,984
I ain't that fucking guy anymore?

1092
01:11:01,590 --> 01:11:03,691
John.

1093
01:11:08,998 --> 01:11:11,466
You'd really want me
to roll with you?

1094
01:11:11,468 --> 01:11:13,268
Hell yeah.

1095
01:11:16,372 --> 01:11:17,672
Give me an hour.

1096
01:11:17,674 --> 01:11:19,774
I'll get the address.

1097
01:11:23,312 --> 01:11:25,880
Angeles, take a walk around and
see what you can find, okay?

1098
01:11:25,882 --> 01:11:27,482
Thanks, man.

1099
01:11:31,020 --> 01:11:33,321
Protect and serve, my ass.

1100
01:11:33,323 --> 01:11:35,890
Just picking up
the pieces here, pal.

1101
01:11:35,892 --> 01:11:37,759
This is a big lab.

1102
01:11:37,761 --> 01:11:39,961
Somebody's gonna feel this.

1103
01:11:39,963 --> 01:11:42,363
Any idea who's running it?

1104
01:11:42,365 --> 01:11:43,731
None.

1105
01:11:43,733 --> 01:11:46,401
Still counting the bodies upstairs.

1106
01:11:46,403 --> 01:11:48,036
A fuckin' video game in there.

1107
01:11:48,038 --> 01:11:50,605
Check this out. The one
outside, he was a lookout.

1108
01:11:52,007 --> 01:11:54,809
Right through the back, into the
lungs, across the carotid...

1109
01:11:54,811 --> 01:11:57,779
Straight out of the special forces
hand-to-hand combat manual.

1110
01:12:00,949 --> 01:12:02,884
Nguyen.

1111
01:12:02,886 --> 01:12:04,952
Yeah, he's out of control.

1112
01:12:06,355 --> 01:12:07,522
All right, put it out...

1113
01:12:07,524 --> 01:12:08,890
Name, description,

1114
01:12:08,892 --> 01:12:10,858
last known location.

1115
01:12:10,860 --> 01:12:11,993
Shit.

1116
01:12:13,696 --> 01:12:16,664
Any luck with the known
associates for the motel guys?

1117
01:12:16,666 --> 01:12:18,466
No. Not a thing.

1118
01:12:19,535 --> 01:12:21,035
- See you later.
- All right.

1119
01:12:23,605 --> 01:12:26,040
Mitchell: <i>Angel, over there. Yeah.</i>

1120
01:12:26,042 --> 01:12:27,775

1121
01:12:30,713 --> 01:12:32,747
- Farragut: Hey.
- <i>(Engine starts)</i>

1122
01:12:32,749 --> 01:12:34,716
Look, I'm holding 'em off
as long as I can.

1123
01:12:34,718 --> 01:12:36,451
What do you wanna hear from me?

1124
01:12:36,453 --> 01:12:38,453
What do I wanna hear?

1125
01:12:38,455 --> 01:12:41,022
I'll tell you what the fuck
I wanna hear.

1126
01:12:41,024 --> 01:12:43,491
What I wanna hear is, "thanks
for all the fucking money

1127
01:12:43,493 --> 01:12:45,460
you've been sending
my way, Hollis."

1128
01:12:45,462 --> 01:12:47,729
That's what I wanna hear.
Don't tell me what you can't do.

1129
01:12:47,731 --> 01:12:51,099
Look, who's the cop
and who's the felon here, okay?

1130
01:12:51,101 --> 01:12:53,868
What, do you think
I'm gonna drop your money

1131
01:12:53,870 --> 01:12:56,771
in my checking account
like some green asshole?

1132
01:12:56,773 --> 01:13:00,475
I can nail your ass any time
I want, okay? You savvy that?

1133
01:13:00,477 --> 01:13:02,977
Okay, tell me
what you have in mind.

1134
01:13:02,979 --> 01:13:05,380
You want nguyen.

1135
01:13:05,382 --> 01:13:07,382
I need to solve
a triple murder, okay?

1136
01:13:07,384 --> 01:13:10,151
I need names, I need evidence.
I need 'em all.

1137
01:13:11,587 --> 01:13:13,121
Okay, I'll think about it.

1138
01:13:13,123 --> 01:13:15,123
This isn't a negotiation.

Jean Paul Mcintyre?

Yes sir. Can I help you?

1155
01:14:47,150 --> 01:14:50,218
I got some questions
about John nguyen.

1156
01:14:50,220 --> 01:14:52,220
He's a friend of yours, right?

1157
01:14:52,222 --> 01:14:54,522
Did you find out
who killed his family?

1158
01:14:54,524 --> 01:14:56,057
We're working on it.

1159
01:14:56,059 --> 01:14:58,893
Look, John has got himself

1160
01:14:58,895 --> 01:15:02,530
mixed up with some very
dangerous individuals.

1161
01:15:02,532 --> 01:15:04,265
Heh.

1162
01:15:04,267 --> 01:15:06,601
That's funny to you?

1163
01:15:07,636 --> 01:15:09,270
You ever been in combat?

1164
01:15:10,806 --> 01:15:13,107
This is what danger looks like.

1165

Um, thank you for your service.

1166
01:15:20,583 --> 01:15:23,618
I'm sorry about the leg, but
what the fuck is your point?

1167
01:15:23,620 --> 01:15:26,087
What would you do
if it was your family?

1168
01:15:28,857 --> 01:15:30,791
What is it with you guys?

1169
01:15:30,793 --> 01:15:33,895
I need information to do my job.

1170
01:15:33,897 --> 01:15:36,597
I can't help if you don't
tell me something.

1171
01:15:36,599 --> 01:15:38,533
Tell you something about what?

1172

- <i>(Cellphone ringing)</i>
<i>- Excuse me.</i>

1179
01:16:50,006 --> 01:16:52,206
I was his C.O.

1180
01:16:53,709 --> 01:16:56,310
So you understand,
I'm not here officially.

1181
01:16:58,947 --> 01:17:00,748
Roger that.

1182
01:17:02,017 --> 01:17:04,986
Army never should have let him out
in the world the way they did.

1183
01:17:04,988 --> 01:17:08,022
They treated him like
surplus equipment,

1184
01:17:09,291 --> 01:17:12,093
like a car more expensive
to repair than replace.

1185
01:17:14,730 --> 01:17:16,631
How you doing, major?

1186
01:17:16,633 --> 01:17:18,866
I ain't broken-down
enough yet, sir,

1187
01:17:18,868 --> 01:17:21,769
- so I'm doing just fine.
- Good.

1188
01:17:21,771 --> 01:17:24,705
Is there a particular reason

1189
01:17:24,707 --> 01:17:27,408
- you're here?
- You're gonna hunt him down.

1190
01:17:27,410 --> 01:17:30,077
That's what you do.
That's your function.

1191
01:17:30,079 --> 01:17:32,680
Before you do,

1192
01:17:32,682 --> 01:17:35,816
I thought you might like to
know in another time and place

1193
01:17:35,818 --> 01:17:38,285
you'd be thanking
the lord almighty Jesus Christ

1194
01:17:38,287 --> 01:17:39,887
he was on your side.

1195
01:17:41,056 --> 01:17:43,658
John was a born leader.

1196
01:17:43,660 --> 01:17:46,694
And he's a true killer. Cold
as fuck if you're down range.

1197
01:17:46,696 --> 01:17:48,863
But, man,

1198
01:17:48,865 --> 01:17:50,998
he'd take candy bars,

1199
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,267
hand 'em out to little kids

1200
01:17:53,269 --> 01:17:55,336
just to see the look
on their faces.

1201
01:17:55,338 --> 01:17:57,838
Volunteer for vaccination details.

1202
01:17:57,840 --> 01:18:01,809
You just don't get many men like that.
You know this, Mr. Mitchell.

1203
01:18:03,078 --> 01:18:05,746
I just thought someone
should know who he was.

1204
01:18:06,682 --> 01:18:08,416
You understand me?

1205
01:18:09,351 --> 01:18:11,719
I think someone out there

1206
01:18:11,721 --> 01:18:13,954
should know who he is.

1207
01:18:17,192 --> 01:18:19,093
I'm sorry for your loss.

1208
01:18:21,430 --> 01:18:23,431
Hey, Griggs.

1209
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:26,867
What's your recommendation?

1210
01:18:26,869 --> 01:18:29,203
I'd find the men
who killed his family

1211
01:18:29,205 --> 01:18:31,305
and I'd put 'em away.

1212
01:18:31,307 --> 01:18:34,341
Then I'd wait for John
to turn himself in,

1213
01:18:34,343 --> 01:18:35,976
because that's what he'll do.

1214
01:18:35,978 --> 01:18:38,079
He won't run from what he's done.

1215
01:18:38,081 --> 01:18:40,214
He's just not wired that way.

1216
01:18:40,216 --> 01:18:43,484
He believes in justice.

1217
01:18:43,486 --> 01:18:46,287
And if you can't
deliver it, well then,

1218
01:18:46,289 --> 01:18:49,256
you can be sure as hell John will.

1219
01:18:50,759 --> 01:18:52,960
Good day, Mr. Mitchell.

1220
01:19:08,343 --> 01:19:11,112
What you said really hurt, man,

1221
01:19:11,114 --> 01:19:13,781
but I needed to hear that shit.

1222
01:19:15,951 --> 01:19:18,486
I haven't left this house in weeks.

Fuckin' weeks.

01:19:21,090 --> 01:19:23,491
Every time I go out, some
motherfucker's gotta remind me

1225
01:19:23,493 --> 01:19:25,826
I got my goddamn leg blown off.

1226
01:19:25,828 --> 01:19:27,394
"Oh, we're so proud of you."

1227
01:19:27,396 --> 01:19:29,930
"God bless you, you're so brave."

1228
01:19:29,932 --> 01:19:32,867
I see those motherfuckers
eyeballing my prosthetic,

1229
01:19:32,869 --> 01:19:34,969
thinking, "this poor guy."

1230
01:19:36,972 --> 01:19:39,807
I've been home for over a year now,

1231
01:19:39,809 --> 01:19:42,276
just sitting around getting soft,

1232
01:19:42,278 --> 01:19:45,146
letting all that pity
make a bitch out of me.

1233
01:19:46,248 --> 01:19:48,149
But fuck that shit.

1234
01:19:48,151 --> 01:19:49,850

- John: What you got?
- Got another baldy with an a.K.

1237

That makes 12.

1238

Not including Hollis.

1239
01:20:18,313 --> 01:20:19,814

1396
01:31:22,910 --> 01:31:25,245
John: I'm sorry, man.

1397
01:31:26,881 --> 01:31:28,648
We fucked 'em up though.

1398
01:31:28,650 --> 01:31:30,517
We got 'em.

1399
01:31:31,486 --> 01:31:33,253
(Sniffles)

1400
01:31:34,589 --> 01:31:36,122
(Whispers) Fuck 'em.

1401
01:31:47,535 --> 01:31:49,569
You still alive, kid?

1402
01:31:55,276 --> 01:31:57,844
Still wanna know what
happened at the motel?

1403
01:32:03,150 --> 01:32:05,685
I got a pretty good idea
what happened there, kiddo.

1404
01:32:07,054 --> 01:32:09,589
Let's go. Let's get out of here.

1405
01:32:10,758 --> 01:32:13,260
- What about all this?
- What about all this?

1406
01:32:14,729 --> 01:32:19,099
I call this in, you're going
to jail for a very long time.

1407
01:32:21,102 --> 01:32:22,736
I know.

1408
01:32:23,738 --> 01:32:26,740
It's not gonna happen.
Not on my watch.

1409
01:32:26,742 --> 01:32:28,608
But you're a cop.

1410
01:32:28,610 --> 01:32:30,710
Yeah, I am.

1411
01:32:30,712 --> 01:32:32,679
And that's not justice.

1412
01:32:37,985 --> 01:32:42,088
This is a, uh,
certain kind of justice.

1413
01:32:43,124 --> 01:32:46,226
Everybody here got exactly
what they deserved.

1414
01:32:52,567 --> 01:32:54,301
Except for him.

1415
01:32:57,271 --> 01:32:59,606
He's my friend.

1416
01:33:02,243 --> 01:33:05,245
Yeah. He was.

1417
01:33:08,149 --> 01:33:10,283

John: <i>I know that J.P.
Died with honor.</i>

1421
01:34:10,177 --> 01:34:12,846

1422
01:34:16,751 --> 01:34:20,286
<i>I won't be ashamed and afraid</i>

<i>I don't know if that's true,</i>

1425
01:34:32,300 --> 01:34:34,901
