00:01:26,442 --> 00:01:28,501
I've lived in this city all my life.

2
00:01:29,244 --> 00:01:33,203
I'm Max. And I am the luckiest dog in New York.

3
00:01:33,282 --> 00:01:36,308
Because of her. That's Katie.

4
00:01:36,352 --> 00:01:40,254
Katie and I, well, we have the perfect relationship.

5
00:01:40,289 --> 00:01:41,483
We met a few years ago.

6
00:01:41,523 --> 00:01:46,256
And, boy, let me tell you, we got along right away.

7
00:01:46,295 --> 00:01:50,425
It's one of those relationships where...  where you just know.

8
00:01:51,433 --> 00:01:55,529
And get this, she was looking for a roommate. And so was I.

9
00:01:56,238 --> 00:01:59,230
So I just moved in that same day.

10
00:01:59,274 --> 00:02:01,265
It was perfect.

11
00:02:01,377 --> 00:02:04,346
We've been together every since.

12
00:02:05,414 --> 00:02:07,473
Katie will do anything for me.

13
00:02:07,516 --> 00:02:10,383
And I'm her loyal protector.

14
00:02:15,524 --> 00:02:19,255
Our love is... Our love is... how do I put this.

15
00:02:19,294 --> 00:02:21,489
Our love is stronger than words.

16
00:02:21,497 --> 00:02:24,227
Or shoes.

17
00:02:24,466 --> 00:02:27,264
It's me and Katie.

I'm not going to say that we're soul mates, even though any sane person who saw us would.

There's just one little problem.

- Pretty much everyday, she leaves. 

23
00:03:10,412 --> 00:03:14,473
- I'll see you tonight 
- Sometimes I try stuff to get her to stay.

00:03:14,483 --> 00:03:20,388

00:03:31,366 --> 00:03:34,267
What could she possibly be doing?

I'm sleeping on the floor. Like a dog. Why would Katie do this to me?

150
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,361
Because she's a dog person, Max.

151
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:13,306
And dog people do weird and inexplicable things.

00:15:47,302 --> 00:15:51,466
Who's your new friend? Is he good or bad, I do not care.

175
00:15:51,472 --> 00:15:54,407
Oh, he's not who anybody, he just came to visit.

176
00:15:54,442 --> 00:15:58,276
Yeah, he'll be leaving soon.

177
00:16:07,288 --> 00:16:09,483
- Hey, how are you? - Oh, hi.

178
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:13,426
- You're the most beautiful girl I've ever seen. - Hey. Excuse me.

179
00:16:13,461 --> 00:16:17,261
Genius. You're forgetting my rope.

180
00:16:17,465 --> 00:16:20,263
Forget it.

181
00:16:20,435 --> 00:16:22,494
Hi, friends .. how are you ..

182
00:16:23,338 --> 00:16:25,499
Hi, friends .. how are you ..

183
00:16:25,506 --> 00:16:28,373
Hi, friends .. how are you ..

184
00:16:28,476 --> 00:16:31,343
- To, Duke .. - Iya?

185
00:16:31,379 --> 00:16:33,279
Be a good friend and bring me a twig that.

186
00:16:33,314 --> 00:16:38,479
You want, is not it? That would make me happy to chew the twigs.

187
00:16:38,486 --> 00:16:41,387
You've heard of.

188
00:16:44,459 --> 00:16:48,361
No, not that one. That it will not make me happy.

189
00:16:48,363 --> 00:16:51,457
Look for a nice, Duke.

190
00:16:55,303 --> 00:16:58,295
Yes. There he is.

191
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:02,500
U.KAN K.EK T.UKANG JU.AL F.ILM
K.HUSUS E P.ANGKALPINANG, B.ANGKA

192
00:17:03,311 --> 00:17:07,475
Hey, Max. Oh, there are so many branches here, Max.

193
00:17:07,515 --> 00:17:09,449
You must come here and see it.

194
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:12,248
I want to make sure I choose the right branch.

195
00:17:12,287 --> 00:17:15,484
Oh okay.

196
00:17:17,458 --> 00:17:20,427
Look at all these branches.

197
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:24,489
Help! Help!

198
00:17:24,532 --> 00:17:27,228
Hey, did you hear that?

199
00:17:27,268 --> 00:17:31,398
- Text-message. Text-message. - Text-message. Text-message.

200
00:17:36,244 --> 00:17:38,337
What..

201
00:17:44,552 --> 00:17:46,383
Oh!

202
00:17:47,555 --> 00:17:49,284
Uh?

203
00:17:57,465 --> 00:17:59,365
Please, please, please!

204
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,459
- Bye! - Do not leave me here!

205
00:18:01,502 --> 00:18:03,367
Should not be like this, Max.

206
00:18:03,404 --> 00:18:05,497
- Wait! - Do not be upset.

207
00:18:05,506 --> 00:18:07,497
Please help!

208
00:18:07,542 --> 00:18:10,477
Jeez, what happened here?

209
00:18:10,478 --> 00:18:13,276
Mind your own business! Jeez, what happened to you?

210
00:18:13,281 --> 00:18:17,411
I fight, okay? With a big dog.

211
00:18:17,452 --> 00:18:18,419
He lost.

212
00:18:18,453 --> 00:18:22,412
Oh, you headed a dangerous area, a small cat!

213
00:18:22,457 --> 00:18:25,324
I'll be watching your town, man.

214
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,329
And that I do, I'll tie you up,

215
00:18:28,329 --> 00:18:31,389
pull, and pull for hours.

216
00:18:31,399 --> 00:18:34,334
The game is just incomprehensible to me.

217
00:18:34,335 --> 00:18:36,326
Oh, that's nice.

218
00:18:36,371 --> 00:18:39,238
- I'll take it! - Ah?

219
00:18:39,273 --> 00:18:41,298
Uh!

220
00:18:41,342 --> 00:18:44,539
Ooh!

221
00:18:45,246 --> 00:18:47,271
You want to fight me, little cat?

222
00:18:47,515 --> 00:18:52,350
Okay, get ready, the cat, because I'm going to attack!

223
00:18:52,353 --> 00:18:57,484
Lightning and gunturnya right in the face!

224
00:19:01,295 --> 00:19:03,490
Gosh, there are a lot of guys number.

225
00:19:03,498 --> 00:19:08,333
I'm talking about lightning and thunder that will attack you all.

226
00:19:08,403 --> 00:19:10,371
Attacking on the count of three!

227
00:19:10,371 --> 00:19:12,271
2!

228
00:19:12,306 --> 00:19:14,331
Ah!

229
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:19,446
I just remembered I have to go somewhere!

230
00:19:19,447 --> 00:19:21,244
That..

231
00:19:21,282 --> 00:19:24,445
The dog was, uh. I was right?

232
00:19:25,353 --> 00:19:27,412
Okay, I .. You know, I would ..

233
00:19:27,422 --> 00:19:30,323
No offense, but, bye!

234
00:19:58,519 --> 00:20:00,510
Hei!

235
00:20:01,255 --> 00:20:03,416
Hey, you little ..

236
00:20:12,266 --> 00:20:13,494
Duke?

237
00:20:14,368 --> 00:20:17,360
- You are back? - Run!

238
00:20:21,342 --> 00:20:24,505
It was the catcher! Run!

239
00:20:33,454 --> 00:20:35,445
Wait!

240
00:20:38,459 --> 00:20:41,394
2, 4, 6, 8? Hm..

241
00:20:41,429 --> 00:20:44,398
- See you tomorrow, Gerald. - You know it.

242
00:20:44,432 --> 00:20:47,401
10 .. Okay.

243
00:20:47,401 --> 00:20:50,370
Correct.

244
00:20:50,404 --> 00:20:52,463
- A-ha. - Gosh, you see that?

245
00:20:52,507 --> 00:20:56,409
- Yes, I saw it. - Throw it using your hands, slacker!

246
00:20:56,444 --> 00:20:59,379
I would not take it, I like the old way.

247
00:21:10,324 --> 00:21:12,349
Oh, thank you very much, Duke.

248
00:21:12,393 --> 00:21:15,419
I do not like to use this expression, because this offends our species,

249
00:21:15,429 --> 00:21:17,420
but you naughty dog!

250
00:21:17,465 --> 00:21:19,365
Katie is not going to like this.

251
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:22,267
I .. I can not get to the shelter!

252
00:21:22,537 --> 00:21:25,370
What? What is wrong with you?

253
00:21:25,373 --> 00:21:29,434
Well, Katie, Katie just got me out of the shelter.

254
00:21:29,477 --> 00:21:31,445
And if I go back ..

255
00:21:32,413 --> 00:21:35,382
That was the end of my life.

256
00:21:42,356 --> 00:21:45,257
'' The Passion of the Pasion ''

257
00:21:45,293 --> 00:21:47,318
Yes! Hmm ..

258
00:21:47,328 --> 00:21:49,455
Why? Why?!

259
00:21:49,463 --> 00:21:51,294
What is it, Maria?

260
00:21:51,332 --> 00:21:54,460
Maria, your face. It was full of suffering.

261
00:21:54,502 --> 00:21:56,265
What is wrong?

262
00:21:56,304 --> 00:22:00,468
I faced the worst thing in his world!

263
00:22:00,474 --> 00:22:02,442
What? Oh, tell me, Maria!

264
00:22:02,476 --> 00:22:06,344
Tell me now! I can not wait without knowing it again!

265
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:09,406
- Loneliness .. - Ah!

266
00:22:09,417 --> 00:22:11,351
Ah!

267
00:22:11,385 --> 00:22:14,252
- Mary, you can not be lonely. - Max, Max!

268
00:22:14,288 --> 00:22:16,279
Max! Uh?

269
00:22:16,324 --> 00:22:19,259
Hey, I see you, squirrel! This is not your land!

270
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:20,386
We've marked it down!

271
00:22:21,429 --> 00:22:24,330
You should not hide, I can see ..

272
00:22:24,365 --> 00:22:25,423
What's that? How dare you!

273
00:22:25,433 --> 00:22:26,457
Dude, where's Max?

274
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:29,367
No! No one likes you, squirrel!

275
00:22:29,403 --> 00:22:31,303
No!

276
00:22:31,539 --> 00:22:34,372
Friends, really, where is Max?

277
00:22:34,375 --> 00:22:37,344
Come down, man, he's .. Uh?

278
00:22:37,378 --> 00:22:39,278
- He is not here. - Oh, he's fine.

279
00:22:39,313 --> 00:22:43,374
I heard her screaming after she disappeared in the bushes.

280
00:22:44,318 --> 00:22:46,343
Max disappeared?

281
00:22:46,387 --> 00:22:49,413
- This is bad. This is very bad .. - Maria.

282
00:22:49,457 --> 00:22:53,325
If he's true love, you have to go!

283
00:22:53,361 --> 00:22:56,228
Save him! Save him!

284
00:22:56,263 --> 00:23:00,393
- Yes! Yes! I had the love of my life! - Go, go!

285
00:23:00,434 --> 00:23:02,402
I'm coming, Max!

286
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:17,307
Hi Chloe, if anyone asks, I'll find Max.

287
00:23:18,452 --> 00:23:20,477
Oke see you.

288
00:23:28,462 --> 00:23:31,260
Waw, you see that?

289
00:23:31,265 --> 00:23:33,324
Yes, give me some time.

290
00:23:35,336 --> 00:23:37,463
Oh, hey cute rabbit.

291
00:23:37,471 --> 00:23:41,237
What are you doing in the middle of the road?

292
00:23:43,444 --> 00:23:45,503
Help me!

293
00:23:45,546 --> 00:23:47,514
Jay!

294
00:23:47,515 --> 00:23:50,245
- Rabbits! - Huh?

295
00:23:50,284 --> 00:23:52,343
- No! - Hey, what's up?

296
00:23:53,287 --> 00:23:54,481
What the hell?

297
00:23:55,389 --> 00:23:58,290
- Save yourself! - Shut up, man!

298
00:23:58,325 --> 00:24:02,261
Let's do this! Yes!

299
00:24:08,369 --> 00:24:10,269
Wait!

300
00:24:10,304 --> 00:24:12,465
Away from me, pig!

301
00:24:13,407 --> 00:24:15,307
Out of the way!

302
00:24:24,452 --> 00:24:27,421
- What happened? - I do not know!

303
00:24:30,291 --> 00:24:33,283
Ripper! Ripper, you are?

304
00:24:33,327 --> 00:24:36,387
Let's go, Ripper! I'm out of here!

305
00:24:41,335 --> 00:24:44,429
The revolution has begun! Freed forever!

306
00:24:44,438 --> 00:24:48,397
Never maintained! Yes!

307
00:24:50,444 --> 00:24:53,379
Who's driving this truck?

308
00:25:20,407 --> 00:25:22,432
Oh..

309
00:25:24,445 --> 00:25:27,414
Come on! Come on, come on, come on!

310
00:25:30,351 --> 00:25:32,319
- Who are you? - Huh?

311
00:25:32,353 --> 00:25:35,447
Who are we? Who are we?

312
00:25:35,489 --> 00:25:38,458
We are pet waste.

313
00:25:38,459 --> 00:25:42,452
Discarded by our owner, and now we want revenge!

314
00:25:42,463 --> 00:25:46,263
It's like a club, but with violence.

315
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:48,291
Take us with you.

316
00:25:49,403 --> 00:25:51,371
I do not think so, Pets!

317
00:25:51,372 --> 00:25:54,273
Yes, you smell like a pet.

318
00:25:54,308 --> 00:25:57,243
You choose your side, and now you regret it.

319
00:25:57,244 --> 00:25:58,268
No, stop!

320
00:25:58,312 --> 00:26:00,371
Who would you call a pet? I'm not a pet.

321
00:26:00,414 --> 00:26:02,405
You're all wrong, we're just like you.

322
00:26:02,449 --> 00:26:04,383
- We hate humans. - Oh, yes!

323
00:26:04,385 --> 00:26:05,352
- I hate them. - That's right!

324
00:26:05,386 --> 00:26:07,411
Oh man, do not get me started talking about people.

325
00:26:07,421 --> 00:26:08,410
- I was right, Duke? - Yes.

326
00:26:08,455 --> 00:26:10,480
That's why we burn our necklaces, man!

327
00:26:10,491 --> 00:26:12,425
We burn it!

328
00:26:12,459 --> 00:26:14,484
- And kill its owner! - Yes! Wait a minute..

329
00:26:14,495 --> 00:26:16,429
- Maybe it's too much? - No, they loved it.

330
00:26:16,463 --> 00:26:18,454
- Yes, we beat them! - Yes, it is true.

331
00:26:18,465 --> 00:26:20,330
Bang, bang, with a shotgun.

332
00:26:20,367 --> 00:26:22,392
If I got money for every owner that I had killed ..

333
00:26:22,436 --> 00:26:25,462
- Oh, yes. - I got one chip,

334
00:26:25,472 --> 00:26:27,497
because I only killed one person.

335
00:26:27,541 --> 00:26:30,271
Oh waw!

336
00:26:30,277 --> 00:26:31,437
You're a cold-blooded!

337
00:26:31,478 --> 00:26:34,276
Ah, you remind me of my friend, Ricky.

338
00:26:34,315 --> 00:26:37,478
But he was already dead. Rest in peace, Ricky!

339
00:26:37,518 --> 00:26:40,487
In fact, this struggle takes more energy.

340
00:26:40,521 --> 00:26:42,318
I'll tell you.

341
00:26:42,356 --> 00:26:45,348
We will expel you both from here, but from now you work for me.

342
00:26:45,392 --> 00:26:48,225
- No problem. - Sounds like a fun challenge.

343
00:26:50,364 --> 00:26:52,389
All right, let's do this!

344
00:26:55,536 --> 00:26:59,302
- To selokannya! - Selokannya?

345
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:02,275
What are you waiting for? I do not play!

346
00:27:02,276 --> 00:27:06,269
I say: to selokannya!

347
00:27:12,353 --> 00:27:16,346
Living revolution, bastard!

348
00:27:20,294 --> 00:27:22,228
I can do it.

349
00:27:25,366 --> 00:27:26,424
Oh!

350
00:27:27,434 --> 00:27:29,368
Max!

351
00:27:29,503 --> 00:27:31,266
Max?

352
00:27:31,305 --> 00:27:34,331
Max! Max! Max!

353
00:27:34,375 --> 00:27:36,366
Max? Max!

354
00:27:49,323 --> 00:27:52,224
You no where, Max?

355
00:27:53,427 --> 00:27:56,294
Looks like you need help.

356
00:27:56,330 --> 00:27:59,265
- Who says so? - Right here.

357
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:02,531
In the dark this forbidden place.

358
00:28:09,543 --> 00:28:12,410
Uh, halo?

359
00:28:12,446 --> 00:28:14,471
I could see only a few miles.

360
00:28:14,481 --> 00:28:17,507
If you get me out, I'll find your friend.

361
00:28:17,518 --> 00:28:21,352
Waw! Is it true? Oh, you're very good.

362
00:28:21,388 --> 00:28:24,380
- You're too sweet. - Oh oh!

363
00:28:24,391 --> 00:28:26,222
Thank you, stranger.

364
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:30,492
But not too sweet. Also there saltiness.

365
00:28:30,497 --> 00:28:34,524
Yes, that's me. Let's get out of here.

366
00:28:35,402 --> 00:28:36,494
Yes, that is so.

367
00:28:36,537 --> 00:28:39,267
A pile of bones Langkahi.

368
00:28:39,273 --> 00:28:41,434
A pile of bones. OK.

369
00:28:41,475 --> 00:28:43,534
Ah, I hope Max is fine.

370
00:28:44,244 --> 00:28:46,303
You are very wise food.

371
00:28:46,347 --> 00:28:48,440
Food? I did not say that, I told a friend.

372
00:28:48,482 --> 00:28:52,316
I told you, I mean food. Friend..

373
00:28:52,353 --> 00:28:56,289
- You know what I mean. - I believe I was lucky to meet you.

374
00:28:56,290 --> 00:29:02,388
Tiberius, and yes, and there is a very good thing for you, whatever you want.

375
00:29:02,429 --> 00:29:05,330
Remove the head cover.

376
00:29:17,444 --> 00:29:20,345
Katie!

377
00:29:20,381 --> 00:29:24,283
- You want to eat me? - Sorry.

378
00:29:24,318 --> 00:29:27,310
You must apologize, you deserve in parentheses.

379
00:29:27,321 --> 00:29:29,516
- You're a naughty bird! - I can not help it.

380
00:29:29,523 --> 00:29:33,425
- I was born with a killer instinct. - It is not an excuse.

381
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:36,395
You're right, even for a predator I'm selfish.

382
00:29:36,397 --> 00:29:39,230
I'm a selfish predators.

383
00:29:39,233 --> 00:29:41,258
No wonder I do not have friends.

384
00:29:41,301 --> 00:29:43,394
Nothing anyone.

385
00:29:43,504 --> 00:29:48,237
- It's useless. - Oh, no, no need to cry.

386
00:29:48,275 --> 00:29:50,334
I'm sorry, you've cried before ..

387
00:29:50,344 --> 00:29:55,475
Please remove these chains, this time I'll help you, I promise.

388
00:29:55,516 --> 00:30:00,385
Tiberius, this is going to sound really scary but,

389
00:30:00,387 --> 00:30:03,447
I do not fully believe in you.

390
00:30:05,325 --> 00:30:08,488
Oh, no .. no .. but, I think all deserve a second chance

391
00:30:08,495 --> 00:30:10,463
and you're just a lonely old bird

392
00:30:10,497 --> 00:30:14,433
and has a strange attitude because you live in a strange cage on the roof.

393
00:30:14,468 --> 00:30:20,270
So I tell you, if you find Max, I'll be your best friend.

394
00:30:20,274 --> 00:30:22,299
A good friend?

395
00:30:22,342 --> 00:30:24,435
You and me?

396
00:30:41,528 --> 00:30:44,361
Yeah, that sounds good.

397
00:30:44,364 --> 00:30:45,388
Let's do this.

398
00:30:45,399 --> 00:30:47,458
Okay.

399
00:30:53,373 --> 00:30:55,500
So what it looks like Max?

400
00:30:55,542 --> 00:30:58,340
Brown and white, she has short hair.

401
00:30:58,345 --> 00:31:04,284
- Very handsome, flickering in his eyes .. - It sounds obvious he was not.

402
00:31:04,284 --> 00:31:09,347
You do not know at all, I mean, whatever, silent.

403
00:31:11,325 --> 00:31:15,284
If the lord come to wear headgear and pretending to be me.

404
00:31:15,295 --> 00:31:18,230
Okay, thanks.

405
00:31:27,274 --> 00:31:30,471
Ah, the smell is disgusting ..

406
00:31:30,511 --> 00:31:35,505
Nice, is also remarkable. I love being here.

407
00:31:44,458 --> 00:31:48,292
What's the password?

408
00:31:48,328 --> 00:31:51,354
Password? Look at me!

409
00:31:51,431 --> 00:31:55,390
I am your leader, the leader did not say a password.

410
00:31:55,402 --> 00:31:59,463
Leaders who create a password, stupid! Okay, I'll create a new password now.

411
00:31:59,473 --> 00:32:04,501
The new password is not asking the password to the leader!

412
00:32:06,346 --> 00:32:08,314
Follow me.

413
00:32:14,521 --> 00:32:21,324
Welcome to the Brotherhood bladder, homes for the pets.

414
00:32:43,283 --> 00:32:44,443
Brothers and sisters dear ..

415
00:32:44,451 --> 00:32:48,478
As you can see I've been back from the surface along with two new members.

416
00:32:48,522 --> 00:32:52,253
These animals are master assassin.

417
00:32:52,392 --> 00:32:55,486
Hei! Hei! Tenang!

418
00:32:55,529 --> 00:32:58,464
Friends, I want you to tell them how you did it.

419
00:32:58,498 --> 00:33:01,433
Please tell all of them about how you killed your master.

420
00:33:01,435 --> 00:33:04,404
Do story short, we liked the sadistic detail here.

421
00:33:04,438 --> 00:33:06,303
- Oh, yes. - Tell us.

422
00:33:06,306 --> 00:33:09,366
- True. Okay. Okay, so - Tell them, Max.

423
00:33:09,409 --> 00:33:13,436
- I like .. Accept it. Mr. stupid! - We like .. Yes!

424
00:33:13,447 --> 00:33:17,406
So it .. that is what we are facing.

425
00:33:17,417 --> 00:33:19,282
That story makes me bored.

426
00:33:19,319 --> 00:33:22,220
- Boring. - Tell me the details to us!

427
00:33:22,256 --> 00:33:23,518
Okay, Max!

428
00:33:23,523 --> 00:33:25,388
OK, it's, um ..

429
00:33:25,425 --> 00:33:30,328
- So stuff in the kitchen .. flat shape - Yes, table. Toaster.

430
00:33:30,364 --> 00:33:33,390
- And the round ends. - A scoop?

431
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,300
- Yes, spoon. - Exactly.

432
00:33:35,335 --> 00:33:39,294
You can not hurt anyone with a spoon, you shovel with a spoon.

433
00:33:39,306 --> 00:33:42,400
How can we kill someone with a spoon?

434
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:48,407
Ah, okay, well, we put a spoon, and pressing a button this machine.

435
00:33:48,415 --> 00:33:50,383
- Correct. True, and it is .. - On the counter. In..

436
00:33:50,417 --> 00:33:52,442
- You know, uh .. it's true. - Knives.

437
00:33:52,486 --> 00:33:55,250
What's that blender?

438
00:33:55,355 --> 00:33:58,256
You blend a person?

439
00:33:58,258 --> 00:34:01,250
It blender, friends. Oh, please tell me if it's a blender.

440
00:34:01,261 --> 00:34:03,491
Hey, man, I know what the name of that machine, we just do away with the machine.

441
00:34:03,530 --> 00:34:05,430
But it is a blender.

442
00:34:05,432 --> 00:34:07,400
Well, you all hear this?

443
00:34:07,434 --> 00:34:09,334
You know who that looks like this?

444
00:34:09,336 --> 00:34:12,362
Ricky, rest in peace.

445
00:34:12,372 --> 00:34:17,309
Ricky, represented the only soldier I've ever had, which is ready to kill a human in sight.

446
00:34:17,344 --> 00:34:19,369
Everything takes practice.

447
00:34:19,379 --> 00:34:22,314
Not the brothers.

448
00:34:23,350 --> 00:34:27,480
See, we all, had suffered at the hands of humans.

449
00:34:27,521 --> 00:34:29,352
I mean, take me as an example.

450
00:34:29,356 --> 00:34:31,517
I used rabbit magician for children's parties.

451
00:34:31,525 --> 00:34:35,256
But then, the rabbit trick failed.

452
00:34:35,262 --> 00:34:40,199
So what did my master? My Lord, leave me magic and disappear.

453
00:34:40,233 --> 00:34:42,224
Of life.

454
00:34:42,269 --> 00:34:44,533
Uh-huh, I live in a tattoo,

455
00:34:44,538 --> 00:34:47,473
first people who practice I often use as a training tool.

456
00:34:47,474 --> 00:34:50,500
Until they get to the space.

457
00:34:51,278 --> 00:34:53,337
I mean, yes, people say they love us.

458
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:55,507
But then they turned and threw us out like garbage.

459
00:34:55,515 --> 00:34:57,449
That's right, is not it? Marcus.

460
00:34:57,451 --> 00:35:00,352
Hey, this is not our fault if we do not look like you.

461
00:35:00,387 --> 00:35:01,479
Yes.

462
00:35:01,488 --> 00:35:05,254
Okay, you guys join this fraternity.

463
00:35:05,292 --> 00:35:07,283
This is the time of initiation.

464
00:35:07,294 --> 00:35:08,488
- What? - Sorry, what time?

465
00:35:08,495 --> 00:35:12,329
Call the rattlesnake!

466
00:35:14,368 --> 00:35:19,362
What is poisonous rattlesnakes? Because I'm allergic to poison!

467
00:35:28,415 --> 00:35:31,316
Okay, show him!

468
00:35:36,456 --> 00:35:39,254
Necklace, Max. No where is she?

469
00:35:39,292 --> 00:35:41,283
What .. what happened to him?

470
00:35:41,294 --> 00:35:43,387
I will not say anything.

471
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:48,458
You're going to tell us there where the max, and you're going to tell us now.

472
00:35:49,369 --> 00:35:51,234
What is it to scare me?

473
00:35:51,271 --> 00:35:53,296
I have a cat, I landed with my legs.

474
00:35:53,306 --> 00:35:57,265
It is always the case, because the head looks often landed.

475
00:35:57,310 --> 00:36:02,247
You want me to catch you, because I'll catch it this way ..

476
00:36:02,249 --> 00:36:06,413
Okay, he's too stupid to talk, too bad to eat.

477
00:36:06,486 --> 00:36:11,423
I'm sick of being nice, where Max?

478
00:36:11,425 --> 00:36:14,326
- Uh .. - Tell me!

479
00:36:14,361 --> 00:36:17,421
I .. let me finish,

480
00:36:17,464 --> 00:36:19,261
Help me!

481
00:36:19,266 --> 00:36:23,225
Do not look at him, look at me, there is no one who can help you.

482
00:36:23,270 --> 00:36:25,397
There is where the Max!

483
00:36:25,405 --> 00:36:27,464
Okay, okay, he's in the sewers.

484
00:36:27,474 --> 00:36:29,305
Let me go, please ..

485
00:36:29,342 --> 00:36:33,278
Forgive me, beautiful dog.

486
00:36:48,261 --> 00:36:54,461
As proof of your loyalty, you will receive a sting from one canine, rattlesnakes blonde.

487
00:36:54,468 --> 00:37:01,271
as a symbol of anti-human!

488
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:21,259
Who wants to go first?

489
00:37:21,294 --> 00:37:25,492
- Uh, here's the problem, I mean, it's .. well .. - A small dog.

490
00:37:25,499 --> 00:37:29,299
What should I call you little dog? It suits you, more or less so.

491
00:37:29,336 --> 00:37:31,463
Listen, between you and the dog fat ..

492
00:37:31,471 --> 00:37:34,269
- I'm more like you. - Why, thank you.

493
00:37:34,307 --> 00:37:38,243
Small dogs will start first, everything, the little dog will start first.

494
00:37:38,278 --> 00:37:43,306
No, no, no small dog wants to go first, take the dog with fat.

495
00:37:43,383 --> 00:37:45,283
No, no .. stop!

496
00:37:45,318 --> 00:37:48,481
Sting sting .. ..

497
00:37:48,488 --> 00:37:52,219
No, no ..

498
00:37:53,426 --> 00:37:57,260
What are you guys doing, initiate a pet?

499
00:37:57,297 --> 00:37:58,264
Pet?

500
00:37:58,298 --> 00:38:02,257
Yeah, just being chased by two dogs in the gang, was killed his master.

501
00:38:02,269 --> 00:38:05,329
No, no, that's not true. You said it was killing the host.

502
00:38:05,338 --> 00:38:10,435
Well, burned, lost, stolen by the cat, it's just a play on words, right?

503
00:38:10,477 --> 00:38:13,344
You do not deserve the mark by a rattlesnake,

504
00:38:13,346 --> 00:38:18,374
- Oh no. We will go out alone. - You guys deserve it eaten by rattlesnakes.

505
00:38:18,418 --> 00:38:22,286
Catch a pet it!

506
00:38:26,359 --> 00:38:28,350
Hold on.

507
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:34,500

00:38:35,335 --> 00:38:36,529
Come on, fight them man.

509
00:38:36,536 --> 00:38:39,300
Wah!

510
00:39:14,274 --> 00:39:17,300
Ah, friends it was an accident.

511
00:39:17,344 --> 00:39:21,280
You crushed the sacred rattlesnake?

512
00:39:21,281 --> 00:39:23,215
He flattened.

513
00:39:23,249 --> 00:39:27,276
Oh, rattlesnakes rattlesnake .. you were in a better place.

514
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:29,413
Hey, Ricky.

515
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:35,453
You never do anything to others.

516
00:39:35,462 --> 00:39:38,226
Well, you've bit off more people than they had been in the viper bite.

517
00:39:38,264 --> 00:39:41,495
You may deserve, accept this, it should have done from the first.

518
00:39:41,501 --> 00:39:45,494
But, it should not happen like this, he's not in my leadership.

519
00:39:45,538 --> 00:39:48,439
Exit!

520
00:39:51,277 --> 00:39:52,437
Come on!

521
00:40:10,363 --> 00:40:12,456
Wait Duke!

522
00:40:16,236 --> 00:40:19,364
Forgive us, this will soon be over now.

523
00:40:19,406 --> 00:40:24,503
- We have a problem. - We've got a lot of problems, which mean?

524
00:40:29,482 --> 00:40:32,542
Stop right there! Stop right now!

525
00:40:32,552 --> 00:40:35,419

He is my friend. And some say he was my boyfriend.

705
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:48,348
Nobody said that.

706
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:50,294
I can not believe you know the little dog.

707
00:56:50,329 --> 00:56:53,492
The world is so small, it's a funny thing ya.

708
00:56:53,532 --> 00:56:55,261
Catch!

709
00:56:55,267 --> 00:56:56,393
Let's go!

710
00:57:02,341 --> 00:57:03,399
Not good!

711
00:57:07,546 --> 00:57:09,480
I'll see ya later.

712
00:57:14,319 --> 00:57:16,412
It all makes!

713
00:57:20,492 --> 00:57:25,361
Derrick, you're stupid! Are they all blurred?

714
00:57:26,398 --> 00:57:29,265
That was almost alone!

715
00:57:29,301 --> 00:57:30,461
Oh sial!

716
00:57:30,502 --> 00:57:33,403
Yes, we got one!

717
00:57:33,439 --> 00:57:36,306
Oh good for you guys!

718
00:57:37,242 --> 00:57:40,405
Oh yes, the little dog, we get a neighbor.

719
00:57:40,412 --> 00:57:43,347
Derrick in the mouth!

720
00:57:45,384 --> 00:57:48,251
Just ignore what just happened, okay?

721
00:57:50,322 --> 00:57:51,448
Ya!

722
00:57:56,261 --> 00:58:01,324
Do you know? I mean it may chatter sausage, but you're okay.

723
00:58:01,366 --> 00:58:03,391
That's right folks!

724
00:58:03,435 --> 00:58:08,338
You know when you first met me like 'oh I do not like it' '.

725
00:58:08,340 --> 00:58:12,367
But now that I've known I was like 'I love her!' '.

726
00:58:14,313 --> 00:58:18,477
You know I've seen this place from the outside.

727
00:58:18,484 --> 00:58:26,448
If I knew what treasures that are here, I'm going to break down the door of her from the first.

728
00:58:26,492 --> 00:58:28,483
What are you talking about?

729
00:58:28,527 --> 00:58:31,325
Pemilikku used to live here.

730
00:58:31,330 --> 00:58:34,424
Dude, wait, you said you used to have an owner?

731
00:58:34,466 --> 00:58:39,233
Well, it's been a long time, I do not want to talk about it.

732
00:58:39,304 --> 00:58:41,363
Yes talk, come on!

733
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:43,305
I do not know..

734
00:58:44,243 --> 00:58:48,304
but what do you know? He used to be very cool.

735
00:58:48,380 --> 00:58:50,245
Ya?

736
00:58:50,282 --> 00:58:54,275
Yes, he's the best.

737
00:59:06,365 --> 00:59:08,356
And we have fun.

738
00:59:10,502 --> 00:59:13,300
We played catch throwing!

739
00:59:18,377 --> 00:59:20,436
Our streets!

740
00:59:22,314 --> 00:59:27,274
We both slept. We both like to sleep.

741
00:59:40,432 --> 00:59:44,425
I went out one night, chasing butterflies or car.

742
00:59:44,436 --> 00:59:47,234
When I catch it and eat it ..

743
00:59:47,272 --> 00:59:48,330
Then maybe butterflies.

744
00:59:48,340 --> 00:59:53,403
I know I've gone too far from home and I can not go back.

745
00:59:53,512 --> 00:59:57,346
A few days later I was arrested animal control.

746
01:00:00,385 --> 01:00:03,411
My past was great, but ..

747
01:00:04,256 --> 01:00:06,417
I've blown it.

748
01:00:07,426 --> 01:00:09,394
Duke, we have to go to your house!

749
01:00:09,428 --> 01:00:13,262
- No. - You know, your master will be pleased.

750
01:00:13,265 --> 01:00:18,225
Really? But he never find me.

751
01:00:18,370 --> 01:00:22,363
Maybe he .. he does not like me.

752
01:00:22,407 --> 01:00:25,376
Of course he likes you, he is your master.

753
01:00:25,410 --> 01:00:28,311
I mean maybe she is very worried.

754
01:00:28,347 --> 01:00:31,373
- I do not know. - I know, and we'll find.

755
01:00:31,383 --> 01:00:35,217
Your master will be pleased, I've just loved the thought.

756
01:00:37,322 --> 01:00:38,482
Okay.

757
01:00:38,523 --> 01:00:40,286
Let's do it.

758
01:00:40,325 --> 01:00:41,383
There they are!

759
01:00:42,261 --> 01:00:44,354
Let the dog, come here.

760
01:00:46,498 --> 01:00:48,432
You think you're going where?

761
01:00:48,467 --> 01:00:50,435
Do not!

762
01:01:02,247 --> 01:01:04,408
Rabbit, he and his crazy eyes!

763
01:01:04,449 --> 01:01:07,384
No one knows what's wrong with that thing!

764
01:01:07,419 --> 01:01:09,478
Listen, this is my opinion.

765
01:01:09,488 --> 01:01:13,481
Maybe there's a dog in the neighborhood that are similar Max.

766
01:01:13,492 --> 01:01:19,328
Begin acquainted with them, after a while you will forget him.

767
01:01:19,364 --> 01:01:24,427
We will not give up, we are dedicated, we are loyal, we are the best pets.

768
01:01:24,469 --> 01:01:25,493
We are a dog!

769
01:01:25,537 --> 01:01:27,471
- Cat. - Eagle.

770
01:01:28,373 --> 01:01:32,207
Congratulations! Today you are a dog, whether you like it or not.

771
01:01:32,244 --> 01:01:33,268
Nice.

772
01:01:33,278 --> 01:01:35,439
Now let's find the rabbit Max before it.

773
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:38,347
Let's go!

774
01:01:43,422 --> 01:01:45,356
Hey, this is ...

775
01:01:46,491 --> 01:01:48,516
Damn it.

776
01:01:53,432 --> 01:01:55,332
Well, they're here.

777
01:01:55,467 --> 01:02:01,303
Nice. We're close. It is dasarjahat action, people.

778
01:02:01,306 --> 01:02:04,298
- Destruction. - This is it. That.

779
01:02:04,343 --> 01:02:06,504
- I know. - Hey. Here, I think ..

780
01:02:10,449 --> 01:02:13,475
Oh, lightweight bombs just melt my brain.

781
01:02:14,319 --> 01:02:16,378
The hare had an idea.

782
01:02:19,358 --> 01:02:20,484
Okay, so, how do I look?

783
01:02:21,326 --> 01:02:22,486
You look great.

784
01:02:23,495 --> 01:02:26,293
- How do I smell her? - Like a dog, pal.

785
01:02:26,398 --> 01:02:27,524
Relaxed, buddy.

786
01:02:30,502 --> 01:02:32,470
There it was.

787
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:39,308
Well, there. Scratching the door.

788
01:02:44,249 --> 01:02:47,412
Remember the sausage factory? It was fun, right?

789
01:02:47,452 --> 01:02:48,476
Are you step-back?

790
01:02:49,287 --> 01:02:51,448
No, why do you think so?

791
01:02:51,490 --> 01:02:54,391
Let's walk to talk about what you think I reverse-reverse?

792
01:02:54,426 --> 01:02:58,487
Friend, you do not have anything to be nervous. They will be glad to see you.

793
01:03:01,366 --> 01:03:03,425
Okay.

794
01:03:07,372 --> 01:03:09,397
A new car.

795
01:03:16,481 --> 01:03:18,415
Can I help you?

796
01:03:20,552 --> 01:03:22,520
No, we're good. thanks.

797
01:03:23,288 --> 01:03:27,281
You're not good, you look gross. I have to ask again, away from my place.

798
01:03:27,426 --> 01:03:30,520
Before I became dumb. You know. What are you already.

799
01:03:31,296 --> 01:03:34,390
- This is my house. - Buddy, maybe we should go.

800
01:03:34,499 --> 01:03:39,266
And why, why Fred wanted a cat? He hates cats.

801
01:03:39,271 --> 01:03:40,465
It is one of the things I liked about him.

802
01:03:40,539 --> 01:03:45,306
Fred, the old people? He..

803
01:03:46,445 --> 01:03:48,470
She died.

804
01:03:50,248 --> 01:03:54,344
Duke, maybe I made a mistake here. Come on, let's go.

805
01:03:54,386 --> 01:03:58,220
You are a liar. Cats can lie all the time.

806
01:03:58,323 --> 01:04:00,291
Do not blown it.

807
01:04:05,330 --> 01:04:07,355
Who are they?

808
01:04:09,501 --> 01:04:13,335
Hey, this is my home. Go.

809
01:04:17,442 --> 01:04:20,309
Duke, it's time to go.

810
01:04:21,379 --> 01:04:25,315
Duke, let's go. Come on. It's not your house anymore.

811
01:04:25,383 --> 01:04:29,513
- Why did you bring me here, Max? - Wait a minute. It is my fault?

812
01:04:29,521 --> 01:04:34,390
- You know, I'm trying to help you. - You're trying to get rid of me.

813
01:04:35,293 --> 01:04:39,457
Yes, you know what, Duke. I do not need this. I .. See you later.

814
01:04:41,266 --> 01:04:43,291
Wow. Wow. Come on, calm down.

815
01:04:46,271 --> 01:04:48,398
Go home, Max.

816
01:04:49,274 --> 01:04:52,266
- Hey, help me here. - Hold, here I come.

817
01:04:55,480 --> 01:05:01,316
Time to take you, big fella. Come on. Just it. You.

818
01:05:07,325 --> 01:05:08,485
Duke!

819
01:05:33,318 --> 01:05:37,220
Oh, the house-house-house.

820
01:05:49,501 --> 01:05:51,332
Small dog.

821
01:05:51,536 --> 01:05:53,265
Ya!

822
01:05:53,371 --> 01:05:55,464
Oh, are you kidding?

823
01:05:55,473 --> 01:05:58,237
You think this is over, the little dog?

824
01:06:11,423 --> 01:06:13,414
- Attack karate! - Wait!

825
01:06:13,491 --> 01:06:17,291
You do not! Can you get away from me!

826
01:06:18,463 --> 01:06:21,296
Tattoo?

827
01:06:22,367 --> 01:06:25,302
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

828
01:06:29,507 --> 01:06:35,412
OTD. It killed me to say. We must join forces, pal.

829
01:06:36,348 --> 01:06:39,408
# Not bedtime #

830
01:06:39,500 --> 01:06:45,500
Ukan | KEK | TUKANG | SELL | FILM SPECIAL | E | PANGKALPINANG | BANGKA

831
01:06:47,525 --> 01:06:52,360
We became a great team, a small dog! Most of whom I do work hard.

832
01:06:52,430 --> 01:06:55,422
- But you helped. - Yes, yes, good. Just keep looking over the street.

833
01:06:55,467 --> 01:06:57,264
You're driving like an animal.

834
01:07:00,538 --> 01:07:05,237
- What is that? You rammed it intentionally. - Oh, it was a hole.

835
01:07:05,477 --> 01:07:07,468
You do not know me very well, OTD.

836
01:07:07,512 --> 01:07:10,379
I always check.

837
01:07:17,389 --> 01:07:18,481
Did you see Van her?

838
01:07:18,490 --> 01:07:22,221
That is all. We're going to hit.

839
01:07:46,518 --> 01:07:48,452
Relaxed, Snowball, I got you.

840
01:07:48,520 --> 01:07:50,488
There he is!

841
01:07:50,488 --> 01:07:52,353
She caught Snowball.

842
01:08:01,266 --> 01:08:03,325
Yey!

843
01:08:09,341 --> 01:08:12,401
Look, pal. This is not apparently.

844
01:08:12,410 --> 01:08:15,243
Shut up.

845
01:08:15,447 --> 01:08:17,415
You will take the boss.

846
01:08:17,482 --> 01:08:20,280
No, no, no. Snowball and I were in the same time now.

847
01:08:20,285 --> 01:08:22,276
Tell him, Snowball, tell them.

848
01:08:22,420 --> 01:08:26,447
Raccoon was lying. He is not the president.

849
01:08:28,526 --> 01:08:32,326
I I..

850
01:08:45,276 --> 01:08:46,402
Gadgets?

851
01:09:21,379 --> 01:09:24,473
- Go, Max. - Good. Okay, I gotta go. thanks.

852
01:09:24,549 --> 01:09:27,245
thanks.

853
01:09:27,352 --> 01:09:28,512
Remains below!

854
01:09:43,301 --> 01:09:45,462
Duke, hold on!

855
01:10:00,318 --> 01:10:01,410
- Duke!
- Max?

856
01:10:01,453 --> 01:10:05,219
- Max! Okay! Take the key! - Good!

857
01:10:38,356 --> 01:10:40,256
Come on. Come on!

858
01:10:40,291 --> 01:10:41,519
I get them!

859
01:10:45,296 --> 01:10:46,490
Max!

860
01:11:20,431 --> 01:11:24,299
Remember me!

861
01:12:15,386 --> 01:12:17,320
I was a hero!

862
01:12:17,388 --> 01:12:22,416
And handsome! A little wet, but I'm still good. I look good.

863
01:12:27,465 --> 01:12:30,229
Are you? Are you okay?

864
01:12:30,501 --> 01:12:33,299
I am good. I am good.

865
01:12:34,472 --> 01:12:36,440
Thank you for coming to save me, Max.

866
01:12:39,477 --> 01:12:45,347
- Max! Oh, Max!
- Lobidubedo!

867
01:12:49,253 --> 01:12:50,481
You need a ride?

868
01:12:50,521 --> 01:12:54,321
Yes, we needed a ride! Let's go, Tattoo!

869
01:12:59,297 --> 01:13:01,356
Taksi!

870
01:13:10,441 --> 01:13:15,344
NO. BERPARKIR ANYTIME

871
01:13:20,318 --> 01:13:24,516
- Hey, hey, Gadgets, wait. - Oh. hi, Max.

872
01:13:25,256 --> 01:13:28,316
Yes, hi. Quiet, quiet!

873
01:13:28,459 --> 01:13:32,418
Yes, I, I just want to ..

874
01:13:33,331 --> 01:13:37,427
See, what you lived by the person throughout life.

875
01:13:37,535 --> 01:13:41,369
But you do not appreciate them up.

876
01:13:41,439 --> 01:13:45,500
I did not know until he beat up dozens of animals at the Brooklyn Bridge.

877
01:13:46,277 --> 01:13:49,269
I guess, I am trying to say is .. If you want to ..

878
01:13:50,281 --> 01:13:52,442
- Okay. - Oh, great. You're in love.

879
01:13:52,517 --> 01:13:55,350
All repugnant to everyone. Let's go!

880
01:13:55,386 --> 01:13:57,251
- Goodbye. - Goodbye.

881
01:13:57,321 --> 01:13:58,447
Does anyone know where we are?

882
01:13:58,523 --> 01:14:01,287
- Goodbye, Max. - Goodbye, Gadgets.

883
01:14:01,359 --> 01:14:04,385
- Oke good bye. - See you later, guys.

884
01:14:04,462 --> 01:14:08,455
Friend, I feel sorry for them. Must go home, sorry!

885
01:14:08,466 --> 01:14:15,429
Not us. Now. Back to our main mission. The fallout of the human race.

886
01:14:15,506 --> 01:14:20,307
That all men! That's all!

887
01:14:22,280 --> 01:14:24,441
Mom, can I have a rabbit?

888
01:14:25,516 --> 01:14:28,485
And pigs and crocodiles and lizards?

889
01:14:32,356 --> 01:14:34,290
Yey! Kelinci!

890
01:14:34,425 --> 01:14:37,292
When! When! When! Body blow! Body blow!

891
01:14:37,295 --> 01:14:38,455
Retreat!

892
01:14:40,364 --> 01:14:41,422
What happened? What did he do?

893
01:14:41,499 --> 01:14:45,333
Rabbits I will love you forever!

894
01:14:47,371 --> 01:14:50,431
Oh, hare!

895
01:14:59,517 --> 01:15:03,351
# I wake up in the morning #

896
01:15:04,489 --> 01:15:07,458
# And the sunlight hurts my eyes #

897
01:15:09,460 --> 01:15:12,486
# And something I want to know #

898
01:15:14,398 --> 01:15:17,265
# And you're in my mind #

899
01:15:18,436 --> 01:15:20,404
# Then I saw #

900
01:15:22,406 --> 01:15:26,240
# We fine #

901
01:15:28,346 --> 01:15:31,247
# Just to see you once #

902
01:15:32,250 --> 01:15:34,445
# And I knew this would happen #

903
01:15:37,321 --> 01:15:39,380
# Love comedy #

904
01:15:40,424 --> 01:15:47,421
# Love within me, within me #

905
01:15:48,299 --> 01:15:52,360
# Love within me, within me #

906
01:15:52,503 --> 01:15:57,440
# Love within me, within me #

907
01:15:58,442 --> 01:16:01,343
# In the light of the next day about #

908
01:16:03,247 --> 01:16:06,341
# Looking possibility #

909
01:16:08,386 --> 01:16:11,287
# When someone in front #

910
01:16:13,257 --> 01:16:16,385
# Always know how #

911
01:16:17,361 --> 01:16:19,420
# And then I saw #

912
01:16:21,265 --> 01:16:24,428
# And everything was fine #

913
01:16:27,271 --> 01:16:29,330
# Just to see you once #

914
01:16:30,474 --> 01:16:34,410
# And I knew that would happen #

915
01:16:35,546 --> 01:16:39,346
# A love comedy, eternity, immortality #

916
01:16:39,383 --> 01:16:45,515
# Eternity, eternity #

917
01:16:45,523 --> 01:16:47,514
# A love comedy, eternity, immortality #

918
01:16:49,327 --> 01:17:01,296
# Eternity, eternity #

919
01:17:04,408 --> 01:17:07,377
Duke, this is the best part of this day.

920
01:17:07,511 --> 01:17:13,347
- Oh, what is he? - Ah, no, that, wait. Yes. It was he, he.

921
01:17:14,418 --> 01:17:16,386
- Hey! - Hey!

922
01:17:16,454 --> 01:17:20,481
There they are! Max and Duke. Come here.

923
01:17:21,359 --> 01:17:24,351
As usual. So how?

924
01:17:24,428 --> 01:17:27,363
Great right? I..

925
01:17:27,398 --> 01:17:34,429
Ah. So maybe some. But I knew this would work.

926
01:17:34,538 --> 01:17:38,235
So, who's hungry?

927
01:17:49,487 --> 01:17:52,320
Welcome home, Duke.

928
01:17:52,323 --> 01:17:54,416
Thank you, Max.
