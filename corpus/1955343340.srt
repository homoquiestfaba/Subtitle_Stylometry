   maybe I would drive her out

115
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:04,770

     for the summer.

So between,
say, 7 and 7:03.

132
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:43,408
        Though I can only stay
        the weekend. I have to--

Yeah, but-- It's just...

            Well, we've, uh,

139
00:05:54,955 --> 00:05:56,655
        been divorced
        for ten years, Stephen,

140
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:57,856
                    so it--

141
00:05:57,891 --> 00:05:59,758
       No. I just thought
       you should know.

142
00:05:59,793 --> 00:06:01,293
   - Thanks.
   - So there wouldn't be any

143
00:06:01,328 --> 00:06:02,260
               Yeah. Thank you.

144
00:06:02,296 --> 00:06:05,530
  And she has a daughter, too,

145
00:06:05,566 --> 00:06:07,632
      a couple months
      younger than Dulcie.

146
00:06:07,668 --> 00:06:09,701
            Oh, well, as luck
            would have it, huh?

     As luck would have it.

148
00:06:12,806 --> 00:06:14,139
            Anyway--

149
00:06:15,776 --> 00:06:17,442
        I don't know
        how Dulcie feels

150
00:06:17,478 --> 00:06:20,579
  about a summer on the farm,
  but I think it's great.

00:06:40,334 --> 00:06:41,733
            Right side or left?

155
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:47,272
           Don't let this Angela
           thing bother you.

156
00:06:47,307 --> 00:06:49,808
            Of all the times
            for her to call--

157
00:06:49,843 --> 00:06:51,276
Did you tell her about us?

158
00:06:51,311 --> 00:06:53,578
        Sure, but it's none
        of her business anyway.

159
00:06:53,614 --> 00:06:54,646
            We're divorced.

160
00:06:54,681 --> 00:06:56,148
      I know. You told me.

161
00:06:56,183 --> 00:06:57,482
                      Yeah. So?

162
00:06:57,518 --> 00:06:59,918
   But you didn't tell me why.

163
00:07:01,155 --> 00:07:03,622
    How about when it's not
    our first night

164
00:07:03,657 --> 00:07:06,124
         and I put on my
        best sweatpants?

165
00:07:07,728 --> 00:07:13,865
 Well, we used to look at these
 real estate catalogs, ya know?

166
00:07:13,901 --> 00:07:16,067
            Uh, country places.

167
00:07:16,103 --> 00:07:20,038
          Uh, no special reason,
          but I don't know.

168
00:07:20,073 --> 00:07:21,673
            This place seemed--

169
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:26,278
       See, it was just supposed
       to be for a few years.

170
00:07:26,313 --> 00:07:27,412
            That was the deal,

171
00:07:27,448 --> 00:07:28,847
            and then we'd go
            back to the city

172
00:07:28,882 --> 00:07:30,582
            and she'd get
            her law degree.

173
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:32,551
            I don't know.

174
00:07:32,586 --> 00:07:34,486
            Something
            happened to me.

175
00:07:35,456 --> 00:07:37,122
                    I just--

176
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:40,192
            I couldn't leave.

177
00:07:40,227 --> 00:07:42,461
        I felt I owed the cows.

178
00:07:42,496 --> 00:07:43,895
                    [chuckle]

179
00:07:43,931 --> 00:07:45,263
            That's silly.

180
00:07:45,299 --> 00:07:49,034
   Uh, then it all just kinda--

181
00:07:51,271 --> 00:07:52,604
            You had to ask.

182
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,207
    No. No, it's--

183
00:07:55,242 --> 00:07:57,509
    it's-- it's fine.
    I wanted to know.

184
00:08:06,186 --> 00:08:07,352
              Wow.

185
00:08:09,456 --> 00:08:12,657
  I'll bet that that's the only
 nightgown in the entire county

186
00:08:12,693 --> 00:08:14,125
        that isn't flannel.

187
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:18,597
        [laughing]

188
00:08:23,237 --> 00:08:25,537
    The left side.

189
00:08:32,045 --> 00:08:35,780
        Well, it's a very long
        day to the farm.

190
00:08:35,816 --> 00:08:38,216
            What do you want
            to talk about?

191
00:08:40,287 --> 00:08:42,821
How about the way
you're ruining my life

192
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:46,024
by making me spend the summer
in Cow Dung, Idaho?

193
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:48,393
You know what
the license plates say?

194
00:08:48,428 --> 00:08:50,462
"Famous Potatoes."

195
00:08:50,497 --> 00:08:53,331
Famous freaking
potatoes, mom.

196
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:54,633
         You'll survive.

197
00:08:54,668 --> 00:08:56,368
I'll miss everything.
I'll come back,

198
00:08:56,403 --> 00:08:57,903
and no one
will remember me.

199
00:08:57,938 --> 00:08:59,571
        We can only hope.

200
00:09:14,555 --> 00:09:17,355
    There was an Arby's
    right by the exit.

201
00:09:19,493 --> 00:09:21,159
        But just make sure
        you file the papers

202
00:09:21,194 --> 00:09:23,328
       with Judge Nusbaum, okay?
       Nobody else.

203
00:09:23,363 --> 00:09:25,931
        Now, the Don McAllister
        thing--

204
00:09:25,966 --> 00:09:28,199
        I don't know, just do
        whatever follow-up--

205
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,944
  What did you do to your hair?

206
00:09:45,152 --> 00:09:47,285
    It was dirty.

207
00:09:48,956 --> 00:09:50,422
           You wash dirty hair.

208
00:09:50,457 --> 00:09:52,657
You wouldn't let me take
a shower this morning.

209
00:09:52,693 --> 00:09:54,225
This is what you get.

210
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:56,628
        You wouldn't wake up.
        I called you ten times.

211
00:09:56,663 --> 00:09:58,830
    It's my hair!

212
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:21,052
      Angela: Almost there.

213
00:10:23,023 --> 00:10:26,691
    Look. They still
    have that sign.

214
00:10:26,727 --> 00:10:29,127
         Oh, yeah. The Coffees.

215
00:10:30,764 --> 00:10:34,132
We'd have totally different
lives if we'd stayed here.

216
00:10:34,167 --> 00:10:37,369
We'd be totally
different people.

217
00:10:39,773 --> 00:10:40,839
              Hmm?

218
00:10:44,411 --> 00:10:46,811
     You know, it makes me
     nervous coming back.

219
00:10:46,847 --> 00:10:48,780
You know what I wish?

220
00:10:50,183 --> 00:10:53,018
      - Sometimes I wish--
      - Here we are.

221
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:14,773
                    Daddy!

222
00:11:14,808 --> 00:11:16,307
              Ahh!

223
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:19,944
           Oh, so big.

224
00:11:20,781 --> 00:11:22,080
             So big.

225
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:25,817
Oh, Leah, Roxanne.

226
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:27,752
         - Angela, hi.
         - Hi.

227
00:11:27,788 --> 00:11:29,988
Uh, I'm afraid the couch
is all we have left.

228
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:31,623
            Oh, that's fine.

229
00:11:31,658 --> 00:11:33,458
      Oh, and, Dulcie,
      your room is just--

230
00:11:34,394 --> 00:11:36,728
   You-- You know that. Sorry.

231
00:11:46,106 --> 00:11:49,908
Um, so anyway, uh,
we'll talk tomorrow.

232
00:11:49,943 --> 00:11:51,576
        - Yeah.
        - Oh, I'm, uh--

233
00:11:51,611 --> 00:11:54,379
      I'm, uh, fixing up
      a barbecue tomorrow

234
00:11:54,414 --> 00:11:57,415
   while the menfolks are out,
  you know, cutting the wheat.

235
00:11:57,451 --> 00:11:58,917
      Angela, Stephen: Hay.

236
00:11:58,952 --> 00:12:00,719
           - The hay.
            - Well...

237
00:12:00,754 --> 00:12:03,588
       That's right.
       Hay for the cows.

238
00:12:06,593 --> 00:12:08,193
        Okay, good night.

239
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:16,167
         Are you sure this whole
         thing's gonna be--

240
00:12:16,203 --> 00:12:19,871
Yeah. No, it's fine.
It's fine.

241
00:12:21,174 --> 00:12:22,307
                    Okay.

242
00:12:22,342 --> 00:12:23,675
                    Well...

243
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:27,746
    welcome home.

244
00:13:22,202 --> 00:13:23,434
       This one's perfect.

245
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:24,869
I hope it's enough.

246
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:29,440
          - Hi.
          - Henrietta.

247
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:32,310
           Hey, Angela. Oh, it's
           been a long time.

248
00:13:32,345 --> 00:13:33,545
    Oh my God.
    It's good to see you.

249
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:35,213
       - You look good.
       - Yeah, so do you.

250
00:13:35,248 --> 00:13:36,915
        - A little thin.
        - Oh.

251
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:38,883
         - Asa.
         - Look at her.

252
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:41,119
        Nice to see you.

253
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:42,654
   Oh this isn't Will, is it?

254
00:13:42,689 --> 00:13:43,721
                That's the boy.

255
00:13:43,757 --> 00:13:44,989
        - Hi, Will.
        - Will the weed.

256
00:13:45,025 --> 00:13:46,991
    Mom, can I have the keys?

257
00:13:47,027 --> 00:13:48,827
        - A church group.
       - Drive carefully.

258
00:13:48,862 --> 00:13:50,161
Well, it's all ready,
everybody.

259
00:13:50,197 --> 00:13:51,563
         - Come dig in.
         - All right.

260
00:13:51,598 --> 00:13:53,898
      - Uh, Angela helped.
      - Well--

261
00:13:53,934 --> 00:13:55,333
   Where's little Miss Dulcie?

262
00:13:55,368 --> 00:13:57,569
   - I haven't seen her in--
   - Dulcie.

263
00:13:57,604 --> 00:13:59,103
Does this bring back
memories?

264
00:13:59,139 --> 00:14:00,071
          Oh, does it.

265
00:14:00,106 --> 00:14:01,573
We had the two families,
the Roberts--

266
00:14:01,608 --> 00:14:03,308
    And the Wilwards.
    See, we'd barbecue out,

267
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:05,009
     the whole bunch of us,
     after a day's work.

268
00:14:05,045 --> 00:14:06,644
           Oh, when all the kids
           were to home.

269
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,179
Now it's only Will left,

270
00:14:08,215 --> 00:14:09,681
but he's decided
on farming.

271
00:14:09,716 --> 00:14:10,882
He says--
Did you know that?

272
00:14:10,917 --> 00:14:12,517
    - Oh, you must be happy.
    - Praise the Lord.

273
00:14:12,552 --> 00:14:15,186
               Praise Him,
               but only He knows

274
00:14:15,222 --> 00:14:16,588
         who'll be left
         on this road

275
00:14:16,623 --> 00:14:17,856
                by the time
                Will takes over.

276
00:14:17,891 --> 00:14:19,390
              All the young ones
              are gone anymore.

277
00:14:19,426 --> 00:14:21,159
            Did you see when you
            were comin' on in?

278
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:22,727
            Folks are moving up
            from the city,

279
00:14:22,762 --> 00:14:23,828
            buying a couple
            of acres.

280
00:14:23,864 --> 00:14:25,296
       No intention of farming.

281
00:14:25,332 --> 00:14:26,831
            And those acreage
            people,

282
00:14:26,867 --> 00:14:28,499
              you can't neighbor
              with them.

283
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:29,834
        Nope.

284
00:14:35,675 --> 00:14:38,710
    Dear Lord, we thank you
    for this bounty

285
00:14:38,745 --> 00:14:42,080
  and especially for bringing
  old friends back to us

286
00:14:42,115 --> 00:14:43,281
     on this beautiful day.

287
00:14:43,316 --> 00:14:44,382
             - Amen.
             - Amen.

288
00:14:44,417 --> 00:14:46,517
         - Amen.
         - [door opens]

289
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:48,253
        What about ants?

290
00:14:48,288 --> 00:14:50,154
No ants in Idaho, Dolly.
You know that.

291
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:51,656
            Come on, say hello.

292
00:14:51,691 --> 00:14:54,292
            You remember
            Mr. and Mrs. Coffee.

293
00:14:54,327 --> 00:14:55,793
       Dulcie, let me
       get you something.

294
00:14:55,829 --> 00:14:57,295
               Asa:
               Boy, she's grown.

295
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:59,464
    Ah. Wienies.

296
00:15:02,269 --> 00:15:04,769
     So what am I gonna do
     here all summer?

297
00:15:04,804 --> 00:15:08,106
Well, Will's church social
group has kids your age.

298
00:15:08,141 --> 00:15:10,275
      There's a water slide
      over in Meridian that is--

299
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:12,310
    Chores.

300
00:15:12,345 --> 00:15:13,378
              Pass.

301
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:15,847
 I won't do anything with cows.

302
00:15:15,882 --> 00:15:17,315
        Um, why not?

303
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:18,917
Their heads are way too big.

304
00:15:18,952 --> 00:15:20,785
    I mean, come on.

305
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:23,254
      [Imitating Marlee Matlin]
      Are you capable of speech?

306
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:24,956
            Stop it.

307
00:15:28,561 --> 00:15:30,995
        You forget how beautiful
        it is here.

308
00:15:31,031 --> 00:15:33,064
       Then why don't you
        spend the summer?

309
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:34,832
It's your home, Dulcie.

310
00:15:34,868 --> 00:15:36,200
        This is not my home.

311
00:15:36,236 --> 00:15:37,535
It's the first house
you ever lived in.

312
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:40,571
    - The only house until--
    - Until she left you?

313
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:41,806
                    Stop.

314
00:15:41,841 --> 00:15:43,041
How--
How is everybody doing?

315
00:15:43,076 --> 00:15:44,175
Can I get you anything?

316
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:45,977
    No, it's all wonderful,
    really.

317
00:15:46,012 --> 00:15:49,147
            And why do you still
            have that...thing?

318
00:15:49,182 --> 00:15:52,317
           I mean, it's not like
           anybody's ever going
           to use it again.

319
00:15:52,352 --> 00:15:55,753
Not supposed to use it.
It's a sculpture.

320
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:58,756
    You got it for me
    out of a Sears catalog.

321
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:00,725
           I remember.

322
00:16:01,695 --> 00:16:03,127
      You used to push me.

323
00:16:03,163 --> 00:16:06,631
Yeah, when you were
little and human.

324
00:16:21,948 --> 00:16:22,981
        What?

325
00:16:24,617 --> 00:16:27,485
   This is the same tea I bought
   15 years ago, isn't it?

326
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,987
            I guess.

327
00:16:29,022 --> 00:16:30,355
   You've never used any of it?

328
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:31,856
            You never bought
            any new ones?

329
00:16:31,891 --> 00:16:33,091
        I guess not.

330
00:16:34,694 --> 00:16:36,494
        It's pathetic, Stephen.

331
00:16:37,597 --> 00:16:40,031
I take it you can't sleep.

332
00:16:42,902 --> 00:16:44,802
    I'm leaving in the morning.

333
00:16:45,638 --> 00:16:47,138
       You don't have to.

334
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:49,807
     Well, I think that Leah may
     disagree with that, but--

335
00:16:49,843 --> 00:16:51,609
But you haven't even
walked around the place.

336
00:16:51,644 --> 00:16:53,745
Don't you want to see
all the changes?

337
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:55,546
           What, now?

338
00:16:55,582 --> 00:16:56,647
        Okay.

339
00:16:57,717 --> 00:17:00,284
            I have a plan
            to improve the herd.

340
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,554
          I'm gonna bring in
          a big Siminthol bull
          that the Leesons have.

341
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:04,956
    Yeah.

342
00:17:04,991 --> 00:17:06,491
           Maybe I'll breed them
           all up to purebred,

343
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:07,759
            take them around
            to state fairs,

344
00:17:07,794 --> 00:17:09,160
            and make a fortune.

345
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:13,831
Are you, um--
I mean, you know, is it--

346
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:15,700
do you think it's going
to be hard financially--

347
00:17:15,735 --> 00:17:17,869
   - What? No.
   - ...to have Dulcie here?

348
00:17:17,904 --> 00:17:19,170
Because I can send money.

349
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:20,338
               I don't need it.

350
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:21,606
Well, I know, but you
can always use it.

351
00:17:21,641 --> 00:17:23,608
        I don't need your money,
        Angela.

352
00:17:23,643 --> 00:17:25,143
    I got it.

353
00:17:26,012 --> 00:17:27,445
                    Good.

354
00:17:29,115 --> 00:17:31,482
Gee, feels just like
old times, doesn't it?

355
00:17:31,518 --> 00:17:34,118
           There were some good
           old times here, too.

356
00:17:34,154 --> 00:17:37,255
    You're a million miles away,
    so it's easy to forget,

357
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:38,890
            but I'm still here.

358
00:17:38,925 --> 00:17:43,194
      I see places and things
      every day, and I remember.

359
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:45,463
           We had
           some good years here.

360
00:17:46,633 --> 00:17:48,466
    I know that.

361
00:17:48,501 --> 00:17:51,002
What do you think, Steve,
that I would--

362
00:17:52,038 --> 00:17:54,172
What, you think
I'd forget that?

363
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:58,543
I remember all the years,

364
00:17:58,578 --> 00:18:02,814
every one, and...
they were the best.

365
00:18:02,849 --> 00:18:04,115
    They were.

366
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:05,283
The best years were here.

367
00:18:05,318 --> 00:18:06,284
              Yeah.

368
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:07,885
                    Wait.

369
00:18:10,323 --> 00:18:11,622
             Dulcie.

370
00:18:11,658 --> 00:18:13,224
She's screwed up.
She hates you.

371
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:15,059
She's flunking out of school.
What did I miss?

372
00:18:15,095 --> 00:18:16,894
           It's just that I'm--

373
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:20,598
           I'm, uh,
           I'm giving her to you

374
00:18:20,633 --> 00:18:23,601
            and running away,

375
00:18:23,636 --> 00:18:25,736
            and it's not fair

376
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:28,339
          because she's gonna
          ruin your relationship

377
00:18:28,374 --> 00:18:31,442
            with--
            oh, what's her name,

378
00:18:31,478 --> 00:18:34,712
        but I'm doing it anyway

379
00:18:34,747 --> 00:18:39,217
            because I don't want
            to see her anymore.

380
00:18:39,252 --> 00:18:41,018
            I don't want to see
            my own daughter.

381
00:18:41,054 --> 00:18:43,454
          How do you like that?

382
00:18:44,757 --> 00:18:46,257
            So I'm, uh...

383
00:18:57,337 --> 00:18:59,137
    I'm glad she came.

384
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:04,742
I mean, maybe just being
here will help.

385
00:19:05,912 --> 00:19:07,612
               Do you think so?

386
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:09,614
        Maybe.

387
00:19:11,017 --> 00:19:13,384
             Don't count on it.

388
00:19:16,789 --> 00:19:18,756
    Oh, bye, Leah.
    Thanks so much.

389
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:20,191
    Nice to meet you.
    Roxanne.

390
00:19:20,226 --> 00:19:22,393
     - Have a nice summer.
     - You, too.

391
00:19:22,428 --> 00:19:23,761
             - Okay.
             - Okay.

392
00:19:25,131 --> 00:19:26,297
        All right.

393
00:19:42,749 --> 00:19:44,182
           Goodbye, sweetheart.

394
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,754
        Please try to be
        good, huh?

395
00:19:51,157 --> 00:19:52,890
           I hate you.

396

    [snort]

399
00:20:34,667 --> 00:20:36,200
        You want something?

400
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:39,170
       I'll give you something.

401
00:20:42,809 --> 00:20:44,375
           You hungry?

402
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:45,710
           Is that it?

403
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:49,247
            Huh? Is that it?
            Are you hungry?

404
00:20:49,282 --> 00:20:50,414
                        Easy.

405
00:20:51,651 --> 00:20:52,950
                        Here.

406
00:20:54,354 --> 00:20:55,686
           That's it.

407
00:20:55,722 --> 00:20:57,922
              That's it. Drink.

408
00:20:57,957 --> 00:20:59,824
               Drink, you ugly,
               jug-headed freak.

409
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,216
    Where are you taking her?

410
00:21:25,251 --> 00:21:26,951
                To the butcher.

411
00:21:26,986 --> 00:21:28,986
               I don't like
               the looks of her.

412
00:21:29,956 --> 00:21:31,022
          It could be hardware,

413
00:21:31,057 --> 00:21:33,024
            but she hasn't bred
            in a while.

414
00:21:33,059 --> 00:21:35,626
            You can't keep
            an open cow.

415
00:21:35,662 --> 00:21:37,395
               It costs too much
               in feed.

416
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:40,831
            I hate to lose them,
            especially her,

417
00:21:40,867 --> 00:21:43,901
   but I get 600 bucks from
   the butcher if she's alive

418
00:21:43,936 --> 00:21:45,536
      and zero from
      the rendering works

419
00:21:45,571 --> 00:21:48,406
   if she just happens
   to keel over one day, so--

420
00:21:48,441 --> 00:21:50,174
What's the rendering works?

421
00:21:50,209 --> 00:21:52,310
    It's where they
    turn them into soap.

422
00:21:52,345 --> 00:21:55,212
         It's a business, baby.

423
00:21:56,316 --> 00:21:58,482
Hey, you want to come with me?

424
00:21:58,518 --> 00:22:00,584
    We could all go.

425
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:02,720
    Have lunch after.

    - Taco Bell?

           - Dominos.

00:22:30,216 --> 00:22:32,750
Girls, would you please
stop complaining?

434
00:22:32,785 --> 00:22:34,485
All you've done
since we got here

435
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:37,822
is sit on your rear ends
and complain every wak--

436
00:22:37,857 --> 00:22:39,757
            Are you mocking me?

437
00:22:39,792 --> 00:22:41,559
You do not mock your mother.

438
00:22:41,594 --> 00:22:44,228
Now, listen, I-- Oh.

439
00:22:44,263 --> 00:22:45,296
    What--

440
00:22:46,933 --> 00:22:48,599
         Look, hold on.

441
00:22:49,535 --> 00:22:51,068
                    Stay here.

442
00:22:52,271 --> 00:22:53,337
         The rope broke.

443
00:22:53,373 --> 00:22:56,340
      Uh, stay back.
      It's dangerous here.

444
00:22:56,376 --> 00:22:58,109
                I got to get her
                tied off.

445
00:23:08,921 --> 00:23:10,354

00:31:17,443 --> 00:31:19,276
    if you want to go fishing.

602
00:31:19,311 --> 00:31:20,344
    Is he kidding?

603
00:31:27,253 --> 00:31:29,453
It's a phoenix, Beefheart.

604
00:31:31,924 --> 00:31:34,491
     It rises from the dead,

605
00:31:34,526 --> 00:31:37,160
        just like me.

606
00:31:42,568 --> 00:31:45,002
           Hey, hey,
           don't go too far out.

607
00:31:46,639 --> 00:31:47,871
           It's deep.

608
00:31:49,341 --> 00:31:51,174
    Then come and save me.

609
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:52,409
            I-- I can't.

610
00:31:52,444 --> 00:31:54,144
    I've got my dress pants on.

611
00:31:55,147 --> 00:31:56,413
           Candy boy!

612
00:31:56,448 --> 00:31:57,881
           Candy boy!

613
00:31:57,917 --> 00:31:59,950
           Candy boy!

614
00:31:59,985 --> 00:32:01,785
           Candy boy.

615
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:03,420
    Candy boy!

616
00:32:03,455 --> 00:32:05,656
            Candy boy! Aah!

617
00:32:09,962 --> 00:32:11,194
        [Dulcie squeals]s]

618
00:32:11,931 --> 00:32:12,696
     Hey!

619
00:32:12,898 --> 00:32:16,366
        Come on. Come on.

620
00:32:16,402 --> 00:32:17,734
              Guys.

621
00:32:28,681 --> 00:32:30,013
         I touched one.

622
00:32:30,049 --> 00:32:32,049
No, you did not.
It's 60 feet down.

623
00:32:32,084 --> 00:32:33,483
           I did, too.

624
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:35,052
    I touched one, candy boy.

625
00:32:35,087 --> 00:32:37,688
         A 1975 Mustang.

626
00:32:37,723 --> 00:32:40,223
      - Convertible.
      - Four on the floor!

627
00:32:40,259 --> 00:32:41,458
        You know what?

628
00:32:42,594 --> 00:32:44,561
    This is a good place.

629
00:32:44,596 --> 00:32:47,264
    This is the first good
    place I've been to

630
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:49,399
    in all of frickin' Idaho!

631
00:32:49,435 --> 00:32:51,335
         [boys whooping]

632
00:32:54,306 --> 00:32:56,406
        Okay. Clutch out.

633
00:32:56,442 --> 00:32:57,641
         Slowly, slowly.

634
00:32:57,676 --> 00:32:59,109
      Clutch in, clutch in.

635
00:33:00,312 --> 00:33:02,112
     Don't worry, it's okay.

636
00:33:02,147 --> 00:33:03,981
         You ready? Ah!

637
00:33:04,016 --> 00:33:05,382
           I've always
           been ready.

638
00:33:05,417 --> 00:33:06,183
              Okay.

639
00:33:06,218 --> 00:33:08,385
       Clutch out. Slowly.

640
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:11,288
        There you go.
        Okay, gas, gas.

641
00:33:11,323 --> 00:33:12,723
              Gas!

642
00:33:13,692 --> 00:33:15,092
            There you go.

643
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:17,861
           That's it.

644
00:33:17,896 --> 00:33:19,563
        [laughing]

645
00:33:19,598 --> 00:33:20,564

647
00:33:22,334 --> 00:33:23,300
              Aah!

648
00:33:23,335 --> 00:33:24,368
               Oh.

649
00:33:26,405 --> 00:33:28,238
    Okay. Second gear.

650
00:33:28,273 --> 00:33:30,107
    It's pretty good
    for the first lesson.

651
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:34,011
          Dork attack.

652

           [honk honk]

653
00:33:35,647 --> 00:33:38,482
   Uh, Dulcie, what are you--

654
00:33:38,517 --> 00:33:40,817
    Oh, yeah. Okay, come on.

655
00:33:40,853 --> 00:33:43,053
Stop before we get
to that truck.

656
00:33:44,089 --> 00:33:45,622
You heard that,
didn't you, Dulcie?

657
00:33:45,657 --> 00:33:47,724
           - What?
           - Dulcie.

658
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,159
            [honking]

659
00:33:49,194 --> 00:33:50,861
            - Brake.
            - Ho--

660
00:33:50,896 --> 00:33:51,895
        Aah!

661
00:33:53,098 --> 00:33:54,798
              Whoa!

662
00:33:57,403 --> 00:33:59,236
     Hilarious. Very funny.

663
00:34:07,246 --> 00:34:10,247
    Whoa, does he need
    a new tractor or what?

664
00:34:13,052 --> 00:34:14,184
                    [honk honk]

665
00:34:24,963 --> 00:34:26,530
              Ahh.

666
00:34:28,801 --> 00:34:30,567
       Leah:
       Hey, is that you?

667
00:34:30,602 --> 00:34:32,369
    What have you been doing?

668
00:34:32,404 --> 00:34:34,438
    Oh, I'm making
    that pasta you like.

669
00:34:34,473 --> 00:34:35,739
    It's the penne arrabiata,

670
00:34:35,774 --> 00:34:37,674
    You know, the one
    with the spice--

671
00:34:37,709 --> 00:34:38,542
                    [grunt]

672
00:34:38,577 --> 00:34:40,610
What is the matter?

673
00:34:40,646 --> 00:34:43,747
    Oh, nothing.
    It's just farmer's back.

674
00:34:43,782 --> 00:34:46,817
    I slipped going after
    that brindle calf.

675
00:34:46,852 --> 00:34:48,718
    The pinheaded one.

676
00:34:48,754 --> 00:34:51,221
    What did you say?
    "Pan Arabian?"

677
00:34:51,256 --> 00:34:54,758
   Great, just give it to me
   here on the floor.

678
00:34:54,793 --> 00:34:57,961
        Ohh. You work too hard.

679
00:34:57,996 --> 00:34:59,896
        - You know what?
        - Hmm.

680
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,933
            I want you to relax
            tonight.

681
00:35:02,968 --> 00:35:04,835
            I'll take care
            of everything.

682
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:07,671
            I will...feed you.

683
00:35:07,706 --> 00:35:10,340
            I will
            tuck you into bed.

684
00:35:10,375 --> 00:35:13,376
          Oh, will you?

685
00:35:13,412 --> 00:35:15,178
           Oh, I will.

686
00:35:15,214 --> 00:35:16,480
                    I will.

687
00:35:16,515 --> 00:35:18,014
              - Mm.
             - Uh--

688
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:19,149
            Hi.

689
00:35:19,184 --> 00:35:20,383
            - Uh--
            - Sorry.

690
00:35:20,419 --> 00:35:22,385
              - Hi.
             - Bye.

691
00:35:22,421 --> 00:35:24,221
                       Uh, bye.

692
00:35:26,325 --> 00:35:27,958
     Dulcie, the boys are here.

693
00:35:27,993 --> 00:35:31,261
    She's not here.
    She went out with Tony
    a couple of hours ago.

694
00:35:31,296 --> 00:35:33,096
          We are alone.

695
00:35:33,132 --> 00:35:35,832
        Uh, you mean they're not
        all going out together?

696
00:35:35,868 --> 00:35:38,802
   I don't know. You think
   Dulcie tells me anything?

697
00:35:38,837 --> 00:35:41,771
  Does Roxy tell you anything?

698
00:35:41,807 --> 00:35:44,941
            She always did
            before we came here.

699
00:35:44,977 --> 00:35:46,176
            Hmm.

700
00:35:49,848 --> 00:35:53,517
         Uh, Stephen...

701
00:35:53,552 --> 00:35:55,285
            I know
            Dulcie has problems,

702
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:58,989
       and I feel sorry for her,
       you know that, but--

703
00:35:59,024 --> 00:36:00,757
       This is about Will?

704
00:36:00,792 --> 00:36:02,993
  But I don't want her problems

705
00:36:03,028 --> 00:36:04,728
   to become Roxy's problems.

706
00:36:04,763 --> 00:36:06,596
       She's going though
       a rough time.

707
00:36:06,632 --> 00:36:07,664
        Give her a break.

708
00:36:07,699 --> 00:36:08,798
            That's what you do.

709
00:36:08,834 --> 00:36:10,867
            You want to know
            what else you do?

710
00:36:11,703 --> 00:36:12,802
       Do I have a choice?

711
00:36:12,838 --> 00:36:14,271
        You laugh at her jokes.

712
00:36:14,306 --> 00:36:16,506
    That's it. That's the extent
    of your parenting.

713
00:36:16,542 --> 00:36:17,741
Well, I think she's funny.

714
00:36:17,776 --> 00:36:19,142
        She's naming the cows.

715
00:36:19,178 --> 00:36:20,644
       Well, that's good.
       Isn't that good?

716
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:22,846
        And so far, she's gotten
        "Knocked up,"

717
00:36:22,881 --> 00:36:25,448
        "Humper," and "Fart."

718
00:36:26,818 --> 00:36:28,185
            Roxanne listens.

719
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:31,288
Yeah. And pretty soon
she'll be smoking crack

720
00:36:31,323 --> 00:36:32,856
just to be like Dulcie.

721
00:36:34,326 --> 00:36:35,859
        I hate that, Stephen.

722
00:36:35,894 --> 00:36:37,561
    But it's okay
    to slam my daughter?

723
00:36:37,596 --> 00:36:39,296
      Dulcie needs a firm hand.

724
00:36:39,331 --> 00:36:41,865
    Come on. Don't give me
    curfews and grounding.

725
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:42,966
    Angela did that.

726
00:36:43,001 --> 00:36:46,503
            Yeah? Well,
            I'm not Angela.

727
00:37:07,259 --> 00:37:08,725
What's the matter, man?

728
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,560
You're supposed to help
with the wood, too, you know.

729
00:37:10,596 --> 00:37:13,063
This is going to be
a pitiful fire.

730
00:37:14,766 --> 00:37:16,233
                        Rox?

731
00:37:17,302 --> 00:37:19,135
I have to tell you something.

732
00:37:20,005 --> 00:37:21,871
Something secret.

733
00:37:24,643 --> 00:37:28,411
    I think I'm--
    I-- I think I'm--

734
00:37:28,447 --> 00:37:29,479
                    Pregnant.

735
00:37:29,514 --> 00:37:31,147
        What did you say?

736
00:37:32,918 --> 00:37:35,652
We-- We bought a...

737
00:37:35,687 --> 00:37:37,621
pregnancy test thing.
Can you help me?

738
00:37:37,656 --> 00:37:40,190
         Yeah, sure.
         Just pee on it.

739
00:37:40,225 --> 00:37:41,891
          That's all, and then,

740
00:37:41,927 --> 00:37:43,927
               if it turns blue,
               then--

741
00:37:45,964 --> 00:37:47,831
     Okay, what is going on?

742
00:37:47,866 --> 00:37:48,898
                   Take a hike.

743
00:37:48,934 --> 00:37:52,235
    No, w-we're not ashamed.

744
00:37:52,271 --> 00:37:53,303
                    It speaks.

745
00:37:53,338 --> 00:37:55,505
          You tell him.

746
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:57,407
   She thinks she's knocked up.

747
00:37:57,442 --> 00:38:00,010
        - With child?
        - No, with calf.

748
00:38:00,045 --> 00:38:02,012
          Come with me.

749
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:14,057
She's going to have a baby?

750
00:38:15,494 --> 00:38:17,294
           I hope so.

751
00:38:17,329 --> 00:38:19,129
You hope so?

752
00:38:31,043 --> 00:38:32,509
              Blue.

753
00:38:44,723 --> 00:38:46,289
      This is the best news

754
00:38:46,325 --> 00:38:48,892
        I have ever heard
       in my entire life.

755
00:38:49,895 --> 00:38:51,695
         Oh, I love you.

756
00:38:53,565 --> 00:38:55,365
  I want you to have our child.

757
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,734
    I want you to be my wife.

758
00:38:59,771 --> 00:39:01,237
        [sobbing]

759
00:39:02,007 --> 00:39:04,240
        You're crazier than me.

760
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:13,717
         First of all...

761
00:39:13,752 --> 00:39:16,953
  I-- I want to tell you that--

762
00:39:16,988 --> 00:39:19,322
    that I've been born again.

763
00:39:20,425 --> 00:39:22,425
                        Oh.

764
00:39:22,461 --> 00:39:26,096
           Uh, well, you're
           half Jewish, Roxanne.

765
00:39:27,265 --> 00:39:29,632
     It's all one faith in God.

766
00:39:34,473 --> 00:39:36,639
           And, um...

767
00:39:36,675 --> 00:39:38,375
          And second...

768
00:39:41,279 --> 00:39:42,312
               I--

769
00:39:43,782 --> 00:39:45,482
       I'm gonna
       have Will's baby.

770
00:39:45,517 --> 00:39:47,851
We're going
to get married.

771
00:39:51,356 --> 00:39:52,956
They're in love.

772
00:39:52,991 --> 00:39:54,858
Ever heard of it?

773
00:39:57,996 --> 00:40:00,397
                 Go home, Will.

774
00:40:00,432 --> 00:40:02,399
        I want him to stay.

775
00:40:03,402 --> 00:40:06,302
           Go... home.

776
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:23,386
            We don't even
            have a doctor.

777
00:40:23,422 --> 00:40:25,288
             We don't even
             have a doctor here.

778
00:40:25,323 --> 00:40:27,123
              Uh...

779
00:40:27,159 --> 00:40:30,693
        not that I would let
        a doctor here touch her.

780
00:40:30,729 --> 00:40:34,030
            Uh, okay, so we're
            going to have to go
            back to Seattle.

781
00:40:34,065 --> 00:40:35,865
        We're gonna have to call
        Shepherd because...

782
00:40:35,867 --> 00:40:38,568
            And you are not
            getting married.

783
00:40:38,603 --> 00:40:42,572
    And you are not born again.

784
00:40:42,607 --> 00:40:45,942
What do you think, she was,
like, brainwashed by a cult?

785
00:40:45,977 --> 00:40:49,212
She actually wants to get
married and have a baby

786
00:40:49,247 --> 00:40:50,547
and stay here in Cowville,

787
00:40:50,582 --> 00:40:52,048
which I wouldn't do
if you took my liver out.

788
00:40:52,083 --> 00:40:54,184
            Shut up!

789
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:59,022
    For once,
    this is not about you.

790
00:40:59,057 --> 00:41:01,825
     This is my baby's life,

791
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:03,993
      and you have nothing
      to do with it.

792
00:41:05,864 --> 00:41:07,130
             Don't.

793
00:41:10,602 --> 00:41:13,036
       I want to be alone
        with my daughter.

794
00:41:18,009 --> 00:41:19,409
                    Now.

795
00:41:19,444 --> 00:41:22,579
        I should be there.
        I told Rox I'd be there.

796
00:41:22,614 --> 00:41:25,048
            What do you think
            Leah's doing to her?

797
00:41:25,083 --> 00:41:27,083
        She is reminding her,
        I would guess,

798
00:41:27,118 --> 00:41:30,353
        that she was only 17
        when Roxanne was born.

799
00:41:30,388 --> 00:41:31,387
             Really?

800
00:41:31,423 --> 00:41:32,989
And that she didn't
finish high school

801
00:41:33,024 --> 00:41:34,324
or go to college,

802
00:41:34,359 --> 00:41:36,326
and maybe that's why
she wants a better life

803
00:41:36,361 --> 00:41:38,328
for her daughter.
Help me with the nails.

804
00:41:38,363 --> 00:41:39,762
          I hate nails.

805
00:41:39,798 --> 00:41:42,031
        Anyway, what she wants
        isn't the point.

806
00:41:42,067 --> 00:41:45,068
        Her parents didn't want
        her to get knocked up,
        but she did.

807
00:41:45,103 --> 00:41:47,303
    You should just let a person
    do what they want to do.

808
00:41:47,339 --> 00:41:49,005
       Not if they're 16,
       you shouldn't.

809
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:51,508
    Well, people
    used to get married when
    they were, like, 10.

810
00:41:51,543 --> 00:41:54,344
Yeah, and they used to die
when they were, like, 18.

811
00:41:54,379 --> 00:41:56,913
     Well, how old were you guys
     when you got married?

812
00:41:56,948 --> 00:41:58,147
          A lot older.

813
00:41:58,183 --> 00:42:00,917
              See? Your marriage
              was still a flop.

814
00:42:00,952 --> 00:42:02,585
It wasn't a flop.

815
00:42:02,621 --> 00:42:05,088
      We had some
      good years together.

816
00:42:05,123 --> 00:42:07,524
We had you.

817
00:42:07,559 --> 00:42:09,559
            Your bad luck.

818
00:42:11,229 --> 00:42:13,196
    They were the best
    years of my life.

819
00:42:13,231 --> 00:42:16,599
      Well, then you should just
      leave Will and Rox alone.

820
00:42:16,635 --> 00:42:18,101
        Maybe
        they'll get a divorce,

821
00:42:18,136 --> 00:42:19,669
        but they can have
        some good years, too,

822
00:42:19,704 --> 00:42:22,405
            and they'll
            still have the baby.

823
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:25,241
            Is Leah sorry
            she had Rox?

824
00:42:25,277 --> 00:42:27,076
       I'm sure she isn't.

825
00:42:27,112 --> 00:42:29,012
               And are you sorry
               you had me?

826
00:42:29,047 --> 00:42:30,446
        Every day.

827
00:42:46,331 --> 00:42:48,431
       You're very smart,
       you know that?

828
00:42:49,734 --> 00:42:53,670
Of course you're wrong,
but you're very smart.

829
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:05,748
          [phone rings]

830
00:43:07,018 --> 00:43:08,117
             [ring]

831
00:43:08,153 --> 00:43:09,118
             Hello.

832
00:43:09,154 --> 00:43:10,420
          Are you sitting down?

833
00:43:10,455 --> 00:43:13,489
    - Dulcie. What--
    - <i> No, believe it or not.</i>

834
00:43:13,525 --> 00:43:16,793
    Roxanne is pregnant
    with Will Coffee's baby.

835
00:43:16,828 --> 00:43:19,562
        <i> They're getting married</i>
        <i> on Labor Day.</i>

836
00:43:19,598 --> 00:43:21,364
       Oh, you're kidding.

837
00:43:21,399 --> 00:43:23,866
       - God's been busy.
       -<i> Who?</i>

838
00:43:23,902 --> 00:43:26,769
           Hey, Dulcie
           is the maid of honor

839
00:43:26,805 --> 00:43:28,905
           and the godmother.

840
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:31,174
<i>[laughing]</i>
<i>She's the godmother?</i>

841
00:43:31,209 --> 00:43:34,644
      Well, out this way,
      it's not so funny.

842
00:43:34,679 --> 00:43:37,013
           No, no, of course.
           I'm sorry. I wasn't--

843
00:43:37,983 --> 00:43:40,216
       So, um, how's poor Leah?

844
00:43:40,251 --> 00:43:42,552
            Not good.

845
00:43:42,587 --> 00:43:45,555
    I can't believe she's
    allowing Roxanne to do this.

846
00:43:45,590 --> 00:43:48,625
  Well, I think it came down
  to letting it happen

847
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:50,259
  or losing her daughter.

848
00:43:51,730 --> 00:43:53,162
                    Yeah.

849
00:43:54,366 --> 00:43:56,099
                    So, um...

850
00:43:56,134 --> 00:44:00,203
        are you, um-- I mean,
        are you two okay?

851
00:44:02,707 --> 00:44:04,240
               No.

852
00:44:04,275 --> 00:44:06,509
            This isn't Dulcie's
            fault, is it?

853
00:44:06,544 --> 00:44:09,212
        No. It has nothing
        to do with Dulcie.

854
00:44:09,247 --> 00:44:10,613
             Well, that's good.

855
00:44:10,649 --> 00:44:12,849
      -<i> Yeah, she's fine.</i>
      - I miss her.

856
00:44:12,884 --> 00:44:15,918
    Well, she'll be flying back
    right after the wedding.

857
00:44:17,422 --> 00:44:18,521
        I could come out.

858
00:44:18,556 --> 00:44:20,223
              What?

859
00:44:20,258 --> 00:44:23,359
    Or, you know,
    I don't know. I just--

860
00:44:23,395 --> 00:44:26,195
        You want to come out
        for Roxanne's wedding?

861
00:44:26,231 --> 00:44:27,296
             Well...

862
00:44:29,467 --> 00:44:31,434
            I think
            that would be great.

863
00:44:31,469 --> 00:44:32,635
             You do?

864
00:44:33,605 --> 00:44:34,704
                    Yeah.

865
00:44:34,739 --> 00:44:36,205
    Because then I could
    just drive her back,

866
00:44:36,241 --> 00:44:37,674
    and there's no planes,
    no tickets.

867
00:44:37,709 --> 00:44:38,741
                    Sure.

868
00:44:40,278 --> 00:44:41,911
        You tell Dulcie.

869
00:44:41,946 --> 00:44:43,813
      Don't worry about Dulcie.

870
00:44:43,848 --> 00:44:45,181
            It sucks.

871
00:44:45,216 --> 00:44:46,949
It's very generous offer.

872
00:44:46,985 --> 00:44:48,418
    Dad, it's the 21st century.

873
00:44:48,453 --> 00:44:49,619
       They have airplanes now.

874
00:44:49,654 --> 00:44:51,220
Well, tickets ain't cheap.

875
00:44:51,256 --> 00:44:53,756
I'm pretty low, Dulce.

876
00:44:53,792 --> 00:44:55,525
I mean, the wedding and--

877
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:57,860
         - Me?
         - Absolutely.

878
00:44:57,896 --> 00:45:00,963
    You've been nothing
    but trouble and money.

879
00:45:03,101 --> 00:45:05,334
Bear with her, Dulce.
She loves you.

880
00:45:05,370 --> 00:45:07,403
She wants you home.

881
00:45:07,439 --> 00:45:09,005
I mean,
I'm gonna miss you, but--

882
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:11,474
             Right.

883
00:45:11,509 --> 00:45:12,575
        Now...

884
00:45:14,979 --> 00:45:16,679
I wish you could stay.

885
00:45:16,715 --> 00:45:20,149
I like
having a daughter again.

886
00:45:22,754 --> 00:45:25,054
You do want to go home,
don't you?

887
00:45:28,093 --> 00:45:29,926
                    Well...

888
00:45:32,630 --> 00:45:35,631
            But I'll miss
            the manure festival.

889
00:46:13,505 --> 00:46:14,504
    You look--

890
00:46:14,539 --> 00:46:16,405
        Yeah, so do you.

891
00:46:16,441 --> 00:46:18,541
    I hope you don't mind me
     staying here this time.

892
00:46:18,576 --> 00:46:20,109
   - Ah.
   - Last time was so tough,

893
00:46:20,145 --> 00:46:21,944
       and I thought Leah was--

894
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:23,846
            She's not with you.

895
00:46:23,882 --> 00:46:25,548
               No.

896
00:46:39,964 --> 00:46:41,864
      Another perfect day
      on the farm.

897
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:43,232
I think she's stuck.

898
00:46:43,268 --> 00:46:44,901
            Oh, yeah.

899
00:46:44,936 --> 00:46:47,036
         She's stuck real good.

900
00:46:47,071 --> 00:46:49,005

00:55:57,555 --> 00:55:59,054
     Why aren't you working?

1053
00:55:59,090 --> 00:56:00,055
        It's Saturday.

1054
00:56:00,091 --> 00:56:02,024
           So? [chuckling]

1055
00:56:02,059 --> 00:56:03,959
     Stephen, please.

1056
00:56:03,994 --> 00:56:05,861
   You know what? I need help.

1057
00:56:05,896 --> 00:56:07,496
       What's the matter?

1058
00:56:07,531 --> 00:56:09,965
 <i> I saw one of Dulcie's essays,</i>

1059
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:13,035
  and it-- I don't know.
  It just doesn't make sense.

1060
00:56:13,070 --> 00:56:16,338
    It's all about
    wanting us to disappear

1061
00:56:16,374 --> 00:56:18,674
        and a cow's head
         and antifreeze.

1062
00:56:18,709 --> 00:56:22,344
  <i> And it's not that she's</i>
  <i> doing anything bad anymore.</i>

1063
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:23,946
        - Well, that's--
        - <i> Stephen,</i>

1064
00:56:23,981 --> 00:56:25,481
         she's not doing
        anything at all.

1065
00:56:25,516 --> 00:56:26,648
         She just sits.

1066
00:56:26,684 --> 00:56:29,251
        <i> She doesn't-- And I'm--</i>

1067
00:56:29,286 --> 00:56:31,220
  I'm just afraid that she's--

1068
00:56:31,255 --> 00:56:33,655
      might-- I don't know.

1069
00:56:33,691 --> 00:56:37,025
             What? Oh, come on.

1070
00:56:37,061 --> 00:56:38,894
      <i> I said I don't know.</i>

1071
00:56:38,929 --> 00:56:40,195
   <i> I'm asking for your help.</i>

1072
00:56:40,231 --> 00:56:42,030
                I don't, either.
                I'm not--

1073
00:56:42,066 --> 00:56:44,833
    Here. No. You're not.
    You're not here.

1074
00:56:44,869 --> 00:56:46,802
      But I did spend the entire
      summer with her,

1075
00:56:46,837 --> 00:56:48,237
         and she was just fine.

1076
00:56:48,272 --> 00:56:49,671
     - Don't--
     - [call waiting beeps]

1077
00:56:49,707 --> 00:56:50,773
            Hang on.

1078
00:56:53,878 --> 00:56:55,778
            [grumble]

1079
00:56:55,813 --> 00:56:57,413
    Dulcie.

1080
00:56:57,448 --> 00:56:58,447
                    Hmm.

1081
00:56:58,482 --> 00:57:00,048
It's Roxanne
on the phone.

1082
00:57:00,084 --> 00:57:01,650
She sounds upset.

1083
00:57:05,389 --> 00:57:06,488
               Mm?

1084
00:57:06,524 --> 00:57:08,223
       Dulcie, are you--
       are you awake?

1085
00:57:08,259 --> 00:57:09,925
    Are you listening to me?

1086
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:11,794
            Mm-hmm. Rox?

1087
00:57:11,829 --> 00:57:14,296
    There's something wrong
    with the baby.

1088
00:57:16,233 --> 00:57:18,534
            Um, the--

1089
00:57:18,569 --> 00:57:21,603
      the heartbeat was--
      was-- was wrong,

1090
00:57:21,639 --> 00:57:23,739
    <i> and they did some tests,</i>

1091
00:57:23,774 --> 00:57:26,008
             <i> and...</i>

1092
00:57:26,043 --> 00:57:27,276
           <i> they said</i>

1093
00:57:27,311 --> 00:57:29,011
    that, um, it was genetic

1094
00:57:29,046 --> 00:57:30,412
           and, um...

1095
00:57:31,916 --> 00:57:33,782
    he's gonna die.

1096
00:57:33,818 --> 00:57:34,850
           Are-- Are they sure?

1097
00:57:34,885 --> 00:57:36,318
         <i> I don't know.</i>

1098
00:57:36,353 --> 00:57:38,353
I don't know. I--

1099
00:57:38,389 --> 00:57:41,123
I can feel him kicking,
just the same as always.

1100
00:57:41,158 --> 00:57:42,491
            <i> Well...</i>

1101
00:57:42,526 --> 00:57:44,193
        [car door closes]

1102
00:57:44,228 --> 00:57:45,360
Here comes Will.

1103
00:57:45,396 --> 00:57:48,263
I have to go.
I have to tell him.

1104
00:57:48,299 --> 00:57:49,431
<i>He doesn't know.</i>

1105
00:57:49,467 --> 00:57:51,133
        - Wait, Rox.
        - <i> I have to go.</i>

       [click, dial tone]

1107
00:57:54,572 --> 00:57:56,572
        What? What is it?

1108
00:58:13,991 --> 00:58:15,190
         Hey, stranger.

1109
00:58:15,226 --> 00:58:16,692
             Daddy!

1110
00:58:18,963 --> 00:58:20,362
               Ah.

1111
00:58:21,732 --> 00:58:23,866
            Oh, geez.

1112
00:58:23,901 --> 00:58:26,268
           There's hypothermia.

1113
00:58:26,303 --> 00:58:28,103
            Here. Put this on.

1114
00:58:29,673 --> 00:58:31,340
           Yeah. Okay?

1115
00:58:32,643 --> 00:58:33,842
          Now, listen--

1116
00:58:33,878 --> 00:58:35,043
Let me stay
till Sunday, please.

1117
00:58:35,045 --> 00:58:36,111
           You scared your mom,

1118
00:58:36,146 --> 00:58:37,446
 - you stole her credit card--
 - Saturday.

1119
00:58:37,481 --> 00:58:38,881
            ...you are flunking
            out of school.

1120
00:58:38,916 --> 00:58:40,048
Friday. Friday night.

1121
00:58:40,084 --> 00:58:41,049
I got a good deal
on the tickets.

1122
00:58:41,085 --> 00:58:43,018
I saved her
a hundred bucks.

1123
00:58:43,053 --> 00:58:44,653
            They took Roxy
            to the hospital

1124
00:58:44,688 --> 00:58:45,654
        a couple of hours ago.

1125
00:58:45,689 --> 00:58:47,689
The baby.
I'm in time for the baby?

1126
00:58:47,725 --> 00:58:49,725
Well, come on, hit it.

1127
00:58:50,961 --> 00:58:53,962
        Okay, but
        the baby's not gonna--

1128
00:58:53,998 --> 00:58:56,798
What? It's gonna be okay.

1129
00:58:59,503 --> 00:59:01,803
    Just don't expect too much.

1130
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:05,541
           [murmuring]

1131
00:59:09,179 --> 00:59:11,713
Dulcie, sweetie.

1132
00:59:15,219 --> 00:59:17,085
        Where's the baby?

1133
00:59:17,121 --> 00:59:19,288
They're still working
on her, honey.

1134
00:59:19,323 --> 00:59:21,056
"It's time the baby comes"
is what they said.

1135
00:59:21,091 --> 00:59:25,093
So, uh, they're, um...
What do they call it?

1136
00:59:25,129 --> 00:59:27,195
    Inducing her.

1137
00:59:28,866 --> 00:59:30,432
        But it's gonna be fine.

1138
00:59:30,467 --> 00:59:33,835
     We've been praying
     ever since we heard, and...

1139
00:59:33,871 --> 00:59:36,538
     he's gonna be okay.

1140
00:59:40,811 --> 00:59:42,778
                Hello, Stephen.

1141
00:59:42,813 --> 00:59:44,379
    How are you?

1142
00:59:47,384 --> 00:59:49,284
         It's not real.

1143
01:00:20,351 --> 01:00:23,085
    Okay, the lecture.

1144
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:24,653
                    Spare me.

1145
01:00:24,688 --> 01:00:26,622
         I'm a flunk-out
         rave queen.

1146
01:00:26,657 --> 01:00:27,756
    A what?

1147
01:00:27,791 --> 01:00:29,858
                    Nothing.

1148
01:00:29,893 --> 01:00:32,094
You scare me, baby.

1149
01:00:32,129 --> 01:00:34,596
You don't know what it's
like to have a child.

1150
01:00:34,632 --> 01:00:36,298
It changes you completely.

1151
01:00:36,333 --> 01:00:41,436
Before we had you,
I just-- I was like ice.

1152
01:00:41,472 --> 01:00:43,672
Nothing could touch me,

1153
01:00:43,707 --> 01:00:48,877
and then you were born,
and I melted that minute.

1154
01:00:50,447 --> 01:00:51,513
        Uh...

1155
01:00:54,985 --> 01:00:57,452
    I look at you,
    and I see danger.

1156
01:00:57,488 --> 01:01:01,556
I think "My God,
she flew up here alone.

1157
01:01:01,592 --> 01:01:05,494
She hitched at night, alone."

1158
01:01:05,529 --> 01:01:08,196
And I just want to shrivel up.

1159
01:01:08,232 --> 01:01:10,332
    You don't know.

1160
01:01:10,367 --> 01:01:12,000
You're not supposed to know.

1161
01:01:12,036 --> 01:01:17,105
You're 16 and you're gonna
live forever, and that's good.

1162
01:01:19,176 --> 01:01:21,543
    And I don't yell,
    you know that.

1163
01:01:21,578 --> 01:01:23,345
    I don't make rules.

1164
01:01:23,380 --> 01:01:28,050
    But, baby, look at me.

1165
01:01:30,020 --> 01:01:34,656
    You're not crazy, Dulce,
    are you?

1166
01:01:36,827 --> 01:01:38,794
            Not here.

1167
01:01:44,601 --> 01:01:46,168
          [door opens]

1168
01:01:50,541 --> 01:01:51,773
           It's a boy.

1169
01:01:51,809 --> 01:01:53,041
                    [gasps]

1170
01:01:53,077 --> 01:01:54,810
        - You knew that.
        - [laughter]

1171
01:01:54,845 --> 01:01:57,112
    His name is
    William Asa Coffee III.

1172
01:01:57,147 --> 01:02:01,349
   - Man: Praise the Lord.
   - He was born at 3:12 a.m.

1173
01:02:01,385 --> 01:02:04,219
    He's 5 pounds, 2 ounces.

1174
01:02:04,254 --> 01:02:05,620
       He's kind of small.

1175
01:02:05,656 --> 01:02:08,824
      - Asa: Hallelujah.
      - Group: Hallelujah.

1176
01:02:29,279 --> 01:02:30,812
           I love you.

1177
01:02:30,848 --> 01:02:33,815
     So is that the little guy?

1178
01:02:42,359 --> 01:02:45,627
       Doesn't look like there's
       anything wrong with it--

1179
01:02:45,662 --> 01:02:47,496
                    him.

1180
01:02:48,365 --> 01:02:49,931
           What's the tube for?

1181
01:02:49,967 --> 01:02:51,700
     It's how they feed him.

1182
01:02:51,735 --> 01:02:53,168
                        Oh.

1183
01:02:53,203 --> 01:02:55,170
I'm allowed to hold him.

1184
01:02:57,341 --> 01:02:59,641
Would you like
to see me hold him?

1185
01:02:59,676 --> 01:03:01,143
                    Sure.

1186
01:03:09,019 --> 01:03:13,421
    So, um, I was thinking first
    thing when he leaves here,

1187
01:03:13,457 --> 01:03:15,190
            we should take him
            down to the quarry,

1188
01:03:15,225 --> 01:03:17,359
            you know,
            where it all began.

1189
01:03:17,394 --> 01:03:19,461
Would you
like to hold him?

1190
01:03:21,899 --> 01:03:25,433
        Isn't it against the law
        or something?

1191
01:03:44,955 --> 01:03:46,421
Smell his breath.

1192
01:03:46,456 --> 01:03:47,422
                        What?

1193
01:03:47,457 --> 01:03:50,325
He's never had
anything to eat.

1194
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:53,361
There's nothing to smell
but pure life.

1195
01:04:12,249 --> 01:04:14,149
                Maybe you better
                take him.

1196
01:04:14,184 --> 01:04:16,051
                    I, uh...

1197
01:04:19,857 --> 01:04:21,857
      I'll be right back, okay?

1198
01:04:28,832 --> 01:04:30,465
            [sobbing]

1199
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:48,416
 You spent so little time
 on earth, yet were you loved.

1200
01:04:48,452 --> 01:04:51,086
       And though you be
       born into sin,

1201
01:04:51,121 --> 01:04:54,122
      you should be
      raised up from sin,

1202
01:04:54,157 --> 01:04:57,025
    that the grace
    of Jesus Christ almighty

1203
01:04:57,060 --> 01:04:58,660
   may shine upon thy soul...

1204
01:05:01,965 --> 01:05:04,332
     in the sure
     and certain knowledge

1205
01:05:04,368 --> 01:05:07,535
  that you shall be born again
  into God's world.

1206
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:12,107
          Let us pray.

1207
01:05:14,211 --> 01:05:17,379
      Our father,
      who art in heaven--

1208
01:05:17,414 --> 01:05:18,413
                   Oh, Will.

1209
01:05:18,448 --> 01:05:20,015
      Hallowed be thy name.

1210
01:05:21,051 --> 01:05:23,251
        Thy kingdom come.

1211
01:05:23,287 --> 01:05:27,155
   Thy will be done on earth
   as it is in heaven.

1212
01:05:32,262 --> 01:05:34,296
    <i> Man: In local weather,</i>
    <i> I understand</i>

1213
01:05:34,331 --> 01:05:36,097
    <i> you have some bad news</i>
    <i> for us, Lisa.</i>

1214
01:05:36,133 --> 01:05:38,099
<i>Well, you're right</i>
<i>as always, David.</i>

1215
01:05:38,135 --> 01:05:39,534
<i>It looks like</i>
<i>a wet night here</i>

1216
01:05:39,569 --> 01:05:40,869
<i>in central</i>
<i>and southern Idaho--</i>

1217
01:05:40,971 --> 01:05:42,070
            What the?

1218
01:05:42,105 --> 01:05:43,305
<i>...with a squall</i>
<i>moving down--</i>

1219
01:05:43,340 --> 01:05:44,906
    What are you doing here?

1220
01:05:44,942 --> 01:05:45,941
      Why didn't you call?

1221
01:05:45,976 --> 01:05:47,709
           She didn't tell you.

1222
01:05:47,711 --> 01:05:49,110
              What?

1223
01:05:49,146 --> 01:05:50,712
      - What?
      - I'm staying here.

1224
01:05:50,747 --> 01:05:52,514
    - No, she's not staying.
    - You're staying?

1225
01:05:52,549 --> 01:05:54,349
      - I'm staying here.
      - You are not.

1226
01:05:54,384 --> 01:05:57,752
  I'll put on a pot of coffee,
  and we'll talk about this.

1227
01:05:57,788 --> 01:05:59,454
            I am not talking
            about anything.

1228
01:05:59,489 --> 01:06:01,723
            I am exhausted.
            I'm going to bed,

1229
01:06:01,758 --> 01:06:03,725
      and tomorrow morning, I am
      flying back to the city,

1230
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:06,661
            and Dulcie
            is coming with me.

1231
01:06:06,697 --> 01:06:07,829
                    The end.

1232
01:06:07,864 --> 01:06:09,664
         I am using the bedroom,
         Stephen.

1233
01:06:09,700 --> 01:06:11,933
   - You sleep on the couch.
   - Stop!

1234
01:06:16,573 --> 01:06:18,173
You can't do that.

1235
01:06:19,609 --> 01:06:22,644
You can't come
into my house and do that.

1236
01:06:22,679 --> 01:06:24,012
If Dulcie wants to stay,

1237
01:06:24,047 --> 01:06:26,314
we'll sit down,
and we'll talk about it.

1238
01:06:26,350 --> 01:06:27,816
        But she is not staying.

1239
01:06:27,851 --> 01:06:29,718
And you know what?
Maybe she should stay.

1240
01:06:29,753 --> 01:06:31,753
I can see what this place
is doing for her.

1241
01:06:31,788 --> 01:06:33,388
         - Oh, please.
         - The place.

1242
01:06:33,423 --> 01:06:35,991
    Forget me. Look at her
    and tell me I'm wrong.

1243
01:06:36,026 --> 01:06:37,659
            I don't have to
            tell you anything.

1244
01:06:37,694 --> 01:06:39,928
Tell me this lousy little
farm isn't good for her.

1245
01:06:39,963 --> 01:06:41,162
            I don't have to
            tell you anything

1246
01:06:41,198 --> 01:06:42,564
            because she's mine
            legally.

1247
01:06:42,599 --> 01:06:45,000
    Oh. Don't give me legal.

1248
01:06:45,035 --> 01:06:46,868
    Just tell me the last time

1249
01:06:46,903 --> 01:06:49,738
      she did anything
      for you willingly--

1250
01:06:49,773 --> 01:06:52,574
     cooked a can of soup,
     anything,

1251
01:06:52,609 --> 01:06:56,211
    or just sat
    and watched TV with you.

1252
01:06:56,246 --> 01:06:57,946
              I'm going to bed.

1253
01:06:57,981 --> 01:06:59,114
And didn't hate you.

1254
01:07:06,757 --> 01:07:08,256
               Oh.

1255
01:07:14,431 --> 01:07:16,164
           [knocking]

1256
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:45,894
Do you know
why she can't stay here?

1257
01:07:45,929 --> 01:07:47,829
                        Why?

1258
01:07:47,864 --> 01:07:49,964
    Because...

1259
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,067
I'll be alone then.

1260
01:07:52,102 --> 01:07:54,569
There won't be anybody
in my house--

1261
01:07:54,604 --> 01:07:57,038
    no child...

1262
01:07:57,074 --> 01:08:00,341
no man...just me--

1263
01:08:00,377 --> 01:08:05,413
and I don't think
I can stand that.

1264
01:08:05,449 --> 01:08:08,149
        But if you take Dulcie,
        I'll be alone.

1265
01:08:08,185 --> 01:08:10,685
            That's what I was
            for ten years.

1266
01:08:13,190 --> 01:08:15,256
           No sounds when I came
           in the house.

1267
01:08:15,292 --> 01:08:16,825
            Nobody else's dishes
            in the sink.

1268
01:08:16,860 --> 01:08:18,226
     No one to cook dinner for,

1269
01:08:18,261 --> 01:08:22,397
    and you know what I thought
    about all the time?

1270
01:08:22,432 --> 01:08:24,032
        Remember
        when Dulcie was little?

1271
01:08:24,067 --> 01:08:25,967
        She'd play in the sink,

1272
01:08:26,002 --> 01:08:28,937
      standing on that red stool
      you bought her,

1273
01:08:28,972 --> 01:08:32,740
    pouring water back and forth
    and singing to herself.

1274
01:08:36,980 --> 01:08:39,013
      I was at your front door.

1275
01:08:40,650 --> 01:08:43,318
         Once, a long time ago.

1276
01:08:43,353 --> 01:08:44,486
            Did you know that?

1277
01:08:45,455 --> 01:08:46,921
               No.

1278
01:08:49,192 --> 01:08:51,893
       I could've walked in,
       and we'd be a family now,

1279
01:08:51,928 --> 01:08:56,498
      and I wouldn't be alone,
      and I wouldn't have this--

1280
01:08:58,535 --> 01:09:01,402
       this regret
       that I cannot get rid of,

1281
01:09:01,438 --> 01:09:05,707
            this regret that
            I failed you both

1282
01:09:05,742 --> 01:09:08,109
       because it was my fault.

1283
01:09:08,145 --> 01:09:11,479
            Not yours, Angela.

1284
01:09:11,515 --> 01:09:14,215
             And...

1285
01:09:14,251 --> 01:09:16,484
        And no matter
        how foolish it was,

1286
01:09:16,520 --> 01:09:21,789
    I still kept thinking maybe
    someday they'll come home.

1287
01:09:21,825 --> 01:09:23,892
        One day
        they'll walk in my door,

1288
01:09:23,927 --> 01:09:28,930
            and it'll all be
            like it was before,

1289
01:09:28,965 --> 01:09:35,803
       and then...Dulcie walks
       right in out of the blue,

1290
01:09:35,839 --> 01:09:38,006
          and then you walk in,

1291
01:09:38,041 --> 01:09:42,477
        and I let myself think
        "Could it be?

1292
01:09:42,512 --> 01:09:48,483
        Is it...possible
        she's coming back, too?"

1293
01:09:50,954 --> 01:09:55,823
           And it'll all be
           like it was before...

1294
01:09:55,859 --> 01:09:58,893
           because...

1295
01:09:58,929 --> 01:10:00,762
           you see...

1296
01:10:03,934 --> 01:10:05,867
         the thing is...

1297
01:10:07,771 --> 01:10:09,571
           I love you.

1298
01:10:12,008 --> 01:10:14,209
          And that's the truth,

1299
01:10:14,244 --> 01:10:17,979
           and we always told
           each other the truth.

1300
01:10:18,014 --> 01:10:23,117
     I never stopped loving you,
     even when I hated you.

1301
01:10:23,153 --> 01:10:25,119
        You have my heart.

1302
01:10:27,891 --> 01:10:30,425
            I gave it to you
            when I was young,

1303
01:10:30,460 --> 01:10:32,594
       and I can't get it back.

1304
01:10:38,068 --> 01:10:40,268
      Is that you, Stephen?

1305
01:10:42,606 --> 01:10:45,873
   Because I remember someone
    from a thousand years ago

1306
01:10:45,909 --> 01:10:47,775
        with that voice.

1307
01:10:47,811 --> 01:10:52,080
    But I'd forgotten that
    his words could be so--

1308
01:10:52,115 --> 01:10:53,314
                    What?

1309
01:10:55,652 --> 01:10:57,118
        Sweet.

1310
01:10:59,522 --> 01:11:01,155
        So sweet.

1311
01:11:28,752 --> 01:11:30,451
            [thunder]

1312
01:11:33,189 --> 01:11:34,856
         [wind howling]

1313
01:12:00,283 --> 01:12:01,349
                    Hmm.

1314
01:12:01,384 --> 01:12:03,017
            Cold.

1315
01:12:03,053 --> 01:12:05,019
           I'm sorry.

1316
01:12:05,055 --> 01:12:06,454
              Here.

1317
01:12:09,125 --> 01:12:12,560
          Mmm. I remember this.

1318
01:12:12,595 --> 01:12:14,429
        Raise your arms.

1319
01:12:19,102 --> 01:12:20,935
          High school football.

1320
01:12:20,970 --> 01:12:23,237
           Third string center.

1321
01:12:23,273 --> 01:12:24,772
Stole it.

1322
01:12:26,676 --> 01:12:28,176
                  I can't stay.

1323
01:12:31,081 --> 01:12:31,946
    I know.

1324
01:12:31,981 --> 01:12:34,782
            I made a life there.
            I have clients.

1325
01:12:34,818 --> 01:12:35,650
    I know.

1326
01:12:35,685 --> 01:12:37,085
         I have 43 cases
         right now.

1327
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:38,486
          I just can't
          abandon them.

1328
01:12:38,521 --> 01:12:39,520
    I know.

1329
01:12:40,657 --> 01:12:42,090
    I know.

1330
01:12:46,363 --> 01:12:47,995
                    But, um...

1331
01:12:49,799 --> 01:12:53,434
               Dulcie can stay.

1332
01:12:53,470 --> 01:12:55,370
           Of course.

1333
01:12:55,405 --> 01:12:58,172
      It is better for her here.
      I know that.

1334
01:12:58,208 --> 01:12:59,974
         I do. I just--

1335
01:13:02,946 --> 01:13:04,345
                    I know it.

1336
01:13:08,852 --> 01:13:10,351
            I don't want to go.

1337
01:13:11,654 --> 01:13:13,921
            I want to stay here
            with you.

1338
01:13:15,125 --> 01:13:17,658
        And I want things
        just the way they were.

1339
01:13:18,661 --> 01:13:20,328
            Dulcie
            playing in the sink,

1340
01:13:20,363 --> 01:13:24,632
            just a little girl
            with no problems.

1341
01:13:25,735 --> 01:13:27,602
         And this place,

1342
01:13:27,637 --> 01:13:31,105
        like it was,
        exactly the way it was.

1343
01:13:36,045 --> 01:13:37,412
            And you.

1344
01:13:39,149 --> 01:13:40,648
          Oh, and you.

1345
01:13:53,029 --> 01:13:54,796
          Oh, Stephen,

1346
01:13:54,831 --> 01:13:57,598
             I love this place.

1347
01:13:57,634 --> 01:14:00,134
           I loved it.

1348
01:14:04,307 --> 01:14:06,407

01:20:45,808 --> 01:20:46,807
        Will: Look at it.

1496
01:20:46,843 --> 01:20:48,275
               Oh, look at her.

1497
01:20:53,449 --> 01:20:55,516
Nice heifer.

1498
01:20:56,352 --> 01:20:57,618
                        Yeah.

1499
01:20:58,654 --> 01:20:59,520
                    Hi.

1500
01:20:59,555 --> 01:21:01,822
            Oh, what a sweetie.

1501
01:21:26,015 --> 01:21:27,481
         She likes you.

1502
01:21:27,516 --> 01:21:29,984
   Of course she does.
   What's not to like, right?

1503
01:21:50,740 --> 01:21:52,339
           Here you are, Dulce.

1504
01:21:52,375 --> 01:21:53,674
           Here, girl.

1505
01:21:53,709 --> 01:21:55,442
          Ready? Go. That's it.

1506
01:21:55,478 --> 01:21:56,977
          There you go.

1507
01:21:57,013 --> 01:21:58,512
                        Wow.

1508
01:22:04,921 --> 01:22:07,221
          I'd better
          get the cow into town.

1509
01:22:09,592 --> 01:22:11,892
            Thanks. Red truck.

1510
01:22:32,515 --> 01:22:33,814
        Wait.

1511
01:22:56,772 --> 01:22:59,173
   Come on,
   you got to get some milk.

1512
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:05,813
               Isn't that cute?

1513
01:23:05,848 --> 01:23:07,481
            Drink.

1514
01:23:07,516 --> 01:23:09,149
There we go, girl.

1515
01:23:12,521 --> 01:23:13,954
    Whoa.
