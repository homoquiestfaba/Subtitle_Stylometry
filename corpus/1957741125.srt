1
00:00:07,924 --> 00:00:10,635
I keep having this dream

2
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:15,348
that I'm driving down the highway
in a white Mustang.

3
00:00:20,603 --> 00:00:24,024
I'm with this man dressed in white,

4
00:00:24,065 --> 00:00:25,734
and we're going down the shore

5
00:00:25,775 --> 00:00:27,902
to Point Pleasant.

6
00:00:27,944 --> 00:00:30,780
<i>I need you bad, I need some help</i>

7
00:00:30,822 --> 00:00:33,742
<i>Can't you feel, I'm breaking down</i>

8
00:00:33,783 --> 00:00:35,910
<i>I need your love</i>

9
00:00:35,952 --> 00:00:38,913
<i>Please, baby, please</i>

10
00:00:38,955 --> 00:00:42,751
<i>Shoo-whop</i>

11
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:46,921
<i>Your love is taking me over</i>

12
00:00:46,963 --> 00:00:49,924
<i>Can't control, I'm losing it...</i>

13
00:00:49,966 --> 00:00:51,760
In this dream,

14
00:00:51,801 --> 00:00:53,636
I am both who I am

15
00:00:53,678 --> 00:00:57,098
and who I want to be.

16
00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:08,359
But...

17
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:10,361
it's just a dream.

18
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:23,541
Hey, can we...

19
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:25,210
can we try something else?

20
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:28,670
Okay.

21
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,134
Like that.

22
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,319
- Hey.
- Hey, baba.

23
00:01:52,695 --> 00:01:54,948
Thank you so much.

24
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:57,658
You can come back any time.

25
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,702
<i>Now I don't mean to diss you</i>

26
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:01,871
<i>I'd like to be your mister</i>

27
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:04,374
<i>I miss ya, I kiss ya</i>

28
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:06,751
What a herb.

29
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:09,074
I just rolled a blunt.
You wanna go smoke it?

30
00:02:09,795 --> 00:02:11,589
Yeah, I'm cutting back.

31
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:13,299
What?

32
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:15,291
- Since when?
- Since right now.

33
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:16,553
Okay.

34
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:24,352
Damn. - You look hot.

35
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:26,020
Thank you.

36
00:02:26,062 --> 00:02:29,357
Vinny's taking me to Red Lobster.

37
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:31,526
How fancy.

38
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:36,030
Those don't match.

39
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:40,108
Hey. - Hey.

40
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:41,234
- Hey, hey, drop the socks.
- What?

41
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:42,829
Drop the socks.

42
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:44,372
You're gonna find somebody.

43
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:46,239
Not one of these fuckboy riffraffs

44
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:47,740
that comes crawling up in here all sweaty.

45
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:48,877
No, not one of those.

46
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:51,171
Not one of those sweaty guys.

47
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:53,580
You're gonna find someone
that treats you like a queen.

48
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:54,549
You think so?

49
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:56,009
I do.

50
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:58,219
By the tip of these French tips.

51
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:01,890
There we go.

52
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:03,631
You know, I just hope he's
as good a man as Vinny,

53
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:04,893
'cause that man...

54
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:08,021
he's got a cock like this.

55
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:09,846
And you know, I've seen him
put up a TV in under,

56
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:11,931
like, 20 seconds, I swear to God.

57
00:03:12,741 --> 00:03:15,403
What's up, ladies?

58
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:17,488
Hey... Oh, shit.

59
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,949
Girl, you look sexy as fuck.

60
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:21,900
- Turn around.
- Oh, you like it?

61
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,401
- Oh, I like it.
- You like it?

62
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:25,111
- So fucking fine.
- Special for you.

63
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:27,165
Mm. - Mm, mm.

64
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:29,209
Mm, mm.

65
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,283
- Oh.
- Happy Valentine's Day.

66
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:31,920
You're so sweet.

67
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:33,453
- You're just the sweetest.
- Mm, I am.

68
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:34,422
You're like a butterscotch.

69
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:35,788
Mm!

70
00:03:35,798 --> 00:03:36,915
Ready to go?

71
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:38,081
- Let's go.
- Um... yeah.

72
00:03:38,091 --> 00:03:39,260
Let me just get my coat.

73
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:41,262
- Okay, okay.
- All right, babe.

74
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:46,226
'Sup, Ponyboi?

75
00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:51,439
Did you get my chocolates?

76
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:52,982
Your Russell Stovers?

77
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:54,974
You really know how to treat a girl, Vinny.

78
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:57,987
Oh, you know I treat my bitches right.

79
00:03:58,029 --> 00:03:59,614
I ain't your bitch.

80
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:00,990
Oh... my bad.

81
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:02,283
That's right.

82
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:04,494
You're my princess, Ponyboi.

83
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:08,706
<i>My Little Pony</i>

84
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:11,125
- Stop.
- My Little Pony...

85
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:15,505
All right, baby, I'm ready.

86
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:16,829
All right, let's go.

87
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:17,798
- Let's do this.
- I'm ready

88
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:18,800
for all that shrimp...

89
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:20,301
endless shrimp, shrimp.

90
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:22,053
Oh, honey?

91
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:24,597
Can you finish, 'cause I gotta...

92
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:25,797
Yep.

93
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:27,225
Thank you.

94
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:31,010
- All you can eat, baby.
- Mm.

95
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,470
You walk like that on purpose for me

96
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,763
- Yeah.
- - Mm-hmm.

97
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:35,973
All right, all right.
Come on, let's go.

98
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:52,332
<i>Your body aches from a pain
you can't explain</i>

99
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:55,295
<i>I wish I could be the change</i>

100
00:04:55,336 --> 00:04:59,340
<i>But you need somebody brave</i>

101
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:02,468
<i>Your mind, it wanders like a bird</i>

102
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:05,847
<i>Without its wings,
if I could give you anything</i>

103
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:08,766
<i>Just a free-falling grace</i>

104
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:12,312
<i>Just keep your head up</i>

105
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:14,939
<i>Even when there's too much weight</i>

106
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:17,859
Go each time, don't wait for fate

107
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:22,989
<i>You know I could do you wrong</i>

108
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:25,533
<i>That's my fault, I'm a stupid one</i>

109
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:16,918
Hi.

110
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:18,461
Howdy.

111
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:28,304
Can I help you?

112
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:30,264
I can manage.

113
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:32,266
Thanks.

114
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:34,769
Okay, well, you know,
if you need anything, I'm...

115
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:36,312
here.

116
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:02,672
Sweet car you got out there.

117
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:05,508
Thanks, Ponyboi.

118
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,301
How do you know my name?

119
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:12,515
Oh, right.

120
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:19,564
I'm Bruce.

121
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:20,815
Like Springsteen

122
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:22,984
You a fan

123
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:24,277
Every Jersey girl is.

124
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:36,289
Tell you what.

125
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:38,666
There is something you could do for me.

126
00:07:43,045 --> 00:07:46,132
My buddy, Phil, referred me.

127
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:47,206
Thought I might have a little fun

128
00:07:47,216 --> 00:07:49,041
before I head to Vegas tomorrow.

129
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:50,178
Oh.

130
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:52,597
Phil's a good guy.

131
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:55,308
You ever been to Vegas?

132
00:07:55,349 --> 00:07:57,810
Mm, no, but...

133
00:07:57,852 --> 00:08:00,021
I've always wanted to go, um,

134
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:03,024
if I ever got married,
on my honeymoon or something.

135
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:04,609
I know it's a stupid dream.

136
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,277
No.

137
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,113
I'm a sucker for
those pretty lights myself.

138
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:12,867
So, um, what do you say...

139
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:20,666
Ponyboi

140
00:08:20,707 --> 00:08:22,752
Sorry.

141
00:08:22,793 --> 00:08:24,879
It's a bit of a shit show in here.

142
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:26,547
I like it.

143
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:29,592
Very...

144
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:30,885
you.

145
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:36,265
What's the deal with that name

146
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:40,520
I know your mama didn't name you Ponyboi.

147
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:43,898
No, um...

148
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,150
my daddy did.

149
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:48,226
And how'd he ever come up with that?

150
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:51,656
Well, when I was little, I...

151
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:55,243
hated going to the doctor's.

152
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:59,080
And I loved ponies,
so whenever I went with my dad,

153
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:02,833
he said if I was a good boy,
he'd get me a pony.

154
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,252
And did he ever get you one?

155
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:06,796
No, but, um...

156
00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:08,538
we'd go to the boardwalk arcade,

157
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:11,759
and we'd win knockoff My Little Ponies.

158
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,221
Over there.

159
00:09:18,849 --> 00:09:21,477
That's quite a collection you got there.

160
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:26,399
Why were you at the doctor's so much?

161
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:38,828
I guess I was...
born a little different.

162
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:42,164
That's okay.

163
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,627
I like that you're different.

164
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:53,884
Want some music?

165
00:10:16,657 --> 00:10:18,117
You know, I've seen you before.

166
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:20,161
Oh, yeah?

167
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:22,663
In a dream.

168
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:24,196
You're crazy.

169
00:10:24,206 --> 00:10:27,001
I'm serious.

170
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:28,502
Hmm.

171
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:33,174
I feel like a prom queen.

172
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:39,639
Imagine us...

173
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,183
rolling up in that white Mustang of yours.

174
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:44,977
Oh, that old thing.

175
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:47,897
I love that old thing.

176
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:49,982
It's yours if you want it.

177
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:52,026
Don't fuck with me.

178
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:56,155
You can have whatever you want.

179
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:00,576
You just have to think you deserve it.

180
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:06,040
What do you want, Ponyboi?

181
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:31,065
Too many nights...

182
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:34,725
The doctor's gonna help you be a man.

183
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:36,435
- Don't you wanna be a man
- No!

184
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:49,208
12-year-old intersex male.

185
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,961
He needs surgical intervention.

186
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:58,426
<i>We'll always be in love</i>

187
00:11:58,467 --> 00:12:00,594
<i>Don't fear</i>

188
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:03,848
<i>Too young to feel this way</i>

189
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:07,685
<i>Too young to run away</i>

190
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:09,687
<i>Too young</i>

191
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:46,098
My Little Pony!

192
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:48,100
Hey.

193
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:49,643
You good?

194
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:51,270
Oh, yeah.

195
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:53,022
I am better than ever.

196
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:54,648
You fucking reek.

197
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:57,359
You know you like it.

198
00:12:57,401 --> 00:12:59,278
Where's Angel?

199
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,781
I dropped her off at my place.

200
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:03,324
Puked at Red Lobster.

201
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:05,826
What the fuck?

202
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:08,329
She's, uh...

203
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:09,747
she's pregnant.

204
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:13,000
What? - Mm.

205
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,790
Looks like I'm gonna be a daddy.

206
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:26,347
You know you want Daddy's dick.

207
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:28,766
S... st...

208
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:30,476
Where you going?

209
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:54,198
"Ponyboi,

210
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:55,751
"meet me at the boardwalk.

211
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:58,212
Yours, Bruce."

212
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:03,384
Baby, baby, baby, I'm sorry.

213
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:04,677
W-wait, where you going?

214
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:06,470
Get the fuck off me.

215
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:08,045
No, what, are you just gonna run away again?

216
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:09,765
Get the fuck off me!

217
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:11,006
You won't last a second out there

218
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:12,550
before you start
sucking dicks in bathrooms.

219
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,634
You know why 'cause that's all you're

220
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:14,728
fucking good for.

221
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:19,483
Well, you're just a closeted fucking loser.

222
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:22,611
And you're gonna
be a terrible fucking father.

223
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:29,410
I don't know whether to fuck you...

224
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:31,579
like a bitch...

225
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,747
or a faggot.

226
00:15:56,997 --> 00:16:01,502
<i>There she goes</i>

227
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:09,176
<i>Under the sun</i>

228
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:14,556
<i>Some question there...</i>

229
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:31,240
<i>Roll her eyes</i>

230
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:37,705
<i>Blonde, your hair</i>

231
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:46,213
<i>Fake eyelashes</i>

232
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:15,617
<i>It's a whisper</i>

233
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:20,329
<i>It's just a whisper</i>

234
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:24,126
<i>It's just a whisper</i>

235
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:24,728
<i>In the</i>

236
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:28,524
<i>Holding pattern</i>

237
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:35,614
<i>We liked to call</i>

238
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:39,535
<i>Our lies</i>

239
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:45,082
<i>Perfectly content</i>

240
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:50,003
<i>With our chaos</i>

241
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:55,926
<i>It's all golden</i>

242
00:18:55,968 --> 00:19:00,681
<i>Golden, golden</i>
