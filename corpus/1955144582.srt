1
00:00:15,891 --> 00:00:18,310
I can't... How do you...?

2
00:00:18,393 --> 00:00:21,104
Where's the entrance? Is it not...?

3
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:33,200
<i>Into the camera. Hello.</i>

4
00:00:35,619 --> 00:00:38,664
<i>My name. Right.</i>

5
00:00:38,747 --> 00:00:42,668
<i>My name is Marni Olivia Olsen,</i>

6
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:47,673
<i>and I'm a senior
here at Ridgefield High.</i>

7
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:51,009
<i>What's life like for a
high school student in 2002?</i>

8
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:55,264
<i>Well, for starters, my initials spell...</i>

9
00:00:55,347 --> 00:00:58,183
<i>Moo!</i>

10
00:00:58,267 --> 00:00:59,643
<i>Life is hard.</i>

11
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:06,692
<i>With a little luck,
you'll rise above it.</i>

12
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:44,354
<i>Unfortunately, I never had much luck.</i>

13
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:50,736
<i>Not even a little.</i>

14
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:54,948
<i>Dating all the way back
to my freshman year...</i>

15
00:01:55,032 --> 00:01:57,451
Sorry. Saved.

16
00:02:02,414 --> 00:02:03,707
Sorry. Saved.

17
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,460
<i>I come from a small town
in Northern California,</i>

18
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:09,338
- <i>and in</i> a <i>school as small as mine...</i>
- <i>Oh, sorry. Saved.</i>

19
00:02:09,421 --> 00:02:12,341
<i>...there's always one person
that is so famous</i>

20
00:02:12,424 --> 00:02:14,009
<i>that they outshine all the others.</i>

21
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:25,062
<i>In my class, I was that person.</i>

22
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:26,938
Were you on the squad last year?

23
00:02:27,022 --> 00:02:29,775
All right, ladies,
let's do this! Here we go!

24
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:32,277
Five, six, seven and eight.

25
00:02:32,361 --> 00:02:35,489
And one, cross two, three, four,

26
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:38,700
five, turn, six, seven and eight. Kick!

27
00:02:40,077 --> 00:02:41,828
All right, let's go this time.

28
00:02:41,912 --> 00:02:43,622
- Good luck, girls!
- Big smiles! Here we go!

29
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:46,249
Five, six, seven and eight. And one...

30
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:48,502
<i>I read somewhere that
who you are in high school</i>

31
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:51,213
<i>determines who you'll be
for the rest of your life.</i>

32
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:52,547
Kick!

33
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:57,219
<i>I seriously hope that's not the case.</i>

34
00:02:57,928 --> 00:03:01,098
<i>Then again, the odds
aren't exactly in my favor.</i>

35
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,433
<i>That's my big brother, Will.</i>

36
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:07,437
<i>He's the greatest.
At, like, everything.</i>

37
00:03:09,648 --> 00:03:12,359
Let's go, Gators, let's go!

38
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:17,197
Out of my way!

39
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:20,242
Go, go, Gators!

40
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:24,496
Go, go, go, Gators!
Go, go, go, Gators!

41
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:36,591
Nice work, Gator!

42
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:40,387
P.S., you were prettier
with the mask on.

43
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:02,576
Are you speaking to me yet?

44
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:06,705
I'm not in the mood right now, Marni.

45
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:11,293
I just wanted you to know
that I'm really sorry.

46
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:16,339
And those girls are right.
I am a loser. You know?

47
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:19,634
- Whoa, whoa. Which girls?
- What? No.

48
00:04:19,718 --> 00:04:22,262
No, no, no, no. Who called you a loser,
Marni? I'll talk to them right now.

49
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:23,930
- Who called you a loser?
- Doesn't matter, Will.

50
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:27,642
You can't always protect me from it.
It's true.

51
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:33,106
I wish you could see how
incredible you are, Marni.

52
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:36,443
You just have to believe in yourself,
'cause once you do that,

53
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:39,196
you're gonna be able
to do anything you want.

54
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:43,450
<i>And, of course, Will was right.</i>

55
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:47,704
<i>Once I changed the way I saw myself,
the past was history.</i>

56
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:49,831
<i>I ditched the braces, I got contacts</i>

57
00:04:49,915 --> 00:04:53,376
<i>and I started spending more
than eight dollars on a haircut.</i>

58
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:57,714
I've come a long way
since those horrible days.

59
00:04:57,798 --> 00:05:01,885
But if it weren't for the determination
of that little girl from Ridgefield,

60
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:04,554
the woman standing in front of you
wouldn't be here today,

61
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:07,641
working at one of the top
PR firms in Los Angeles,

62
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:10,602
telling a bunch of
junior publicists about the days

63
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:13,480
when I was the poster child
for the geek squad.

64
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,859
You can't control the things
that happen to you,

65
00:05:17,943 --> 00:05:21,154
but you can control
the way you react to them.

66
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:22,781
It's all perception.

67
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:26,201
That is what public relations
is all about.

68
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:32,415
Thank you. And good luck.

69
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:38,046
- Nice job.
- Thank you.

70
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,970
Great speech. Inspiring.

71
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:48,223
Thank you, sir, very much.

72
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:50,517
Now, I'm gonna need you
to pack up your office.

73
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:55,063
What? Did... Did you just say
that I need to pack up my office?

74
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:58,525
- That's right.
- But I only asked for two days off,

75
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:00,735
and it's for my brother's wedding.

76
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:05,407
There's an opening
in the New York office.

77
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:08,785
VP. It's yours.

78
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:13,957
It... You...

79
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,543
I... The VP for...

80
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:19,129
Unless, of course, you have
a problem with a huge promotion.

81
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:23,842
No, I don't!
I certainly do not. I don't.

82
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:26,845
- Thank you, sir!
- You've earned it.

83
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:34,060
I am excited to see everyone, too, Mom.

84
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:36,563
I can't believe how quickly
this all came together.

85
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:40,358
I know, and it's gonna be so beautiful.

86
00:06:40,442 --> 00:06:43,653
Joanna's Aunt Mona is spending
a fortune for this wedding.

87
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:46,615
I tried to get in touch with her
to say I thought it was too much,

88
00:06:46,698 --> 00:06:48,658
and I got back a text saying,

89
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:51,494
<i>"Happy to do it,
can't wait to meet you all."</i>

90
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:54,247
<i>I just feel bad
that I haven't met Joanna yet.</i>

91
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:56,458
I know. Isn't it funny?

92
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:59,669
You guys all went to high school
together, you don't know each other.

93
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:01,671
Wait, we all went
to high school together?

94
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:03,381
I thought you knew.

95
00:07:03,465 --> 00:07:06,176
No. Well, all Will did
was send me a picture,

96
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:09,471
but she didn't look familiar.
Ridgefield High was really small.

97
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:10,931
I don't remember a Joanna.

98
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:14,142
<i>That's because she didn't
go by Joanna in high school.</i>

99
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:15,936
<i>She went by a nickname.</i>

100
00:07:19,481 --> 00:07:20,523
Deedee.

101
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:23,902
- Deedee?
- No...

102
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:25,862
- Titi?
- Titi?

103
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:29,491
No... I can't believe
I'm blanking on this.

104
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:35,705
<i>- M'?
- That's it! JJ!</i>

105
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:37,332
<i>Joanna,JJ,yeah!</i>

106
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:44,756
No!

107
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:47,801
No! No!

108
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:52,847
No. Nope.

109
00:07:52,931 --> 00:07:56,977
Ma'am? "Fasten your seat belt" sign's
on. I need you to return to your seat.

110
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,312
Mom, are you
telling me that Will is...

111
00:07:59,396 --> 00:08:02,357
Please! I've listened to you talk about
how your "cats are just like people"

112
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,485
- for the last 45 minutes.
- Ma'am, you must remain seated.

113
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:08,822
- It's for your own safety.
- Mom, hold on one second.

114
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:14,744
I'm sorry... Heather.
This is an emergency.

115
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:16,955
My brother is about to marry the girl

116
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:19,207
who single-handedly
ruined my life in high school.

117
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:21,835
So, if you don't mind,
would you please back off?

118
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:26,381
- Sorry, Mom. I...
- I'm sorry, do we have a problem?

119
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:30,760
I don't know, do we have a problem?

120
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:33,555
Is your brother marrying
your arch nemesis?

121
00:08:34,723 --> 00:08:36,641
So you didn't know
it was the same girl?

122
00:08:36,725 --> 00:08:38,727
Nobody knew.

123
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:41,271
My brother was a senior
when I was a sophomore.

124
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:45,734
I can't blame him for not keeping up
with my high school soap opera.

125
00:08:45,817 --> 00:08:47,318
Pretzel?

126
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:52,073
There are seven billion
people on this planet,

127
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:56,327
and I get stuck with
Satan's spawn as my sister-in-law.

128
00:08:56,411 --> 00:08:59,789
She is the reason I
left home in the first place.

129
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:02,459
Marni, let me tell you about bullies.

130
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:06,796
They're just like terrorists,
only they're emotional terrorists.

131
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,465
You can never let them
get the upper hand,

132
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:11,051
so the best thing that you can do
in this situation is remain calm

133
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:13,261
and show her that you are in control.

134
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:16,347
Besides, I don't care if the Ridgefield
mascot getting ploughed got over

135
00:09:16,431 --> 00:09:17,515
- a thousand hits on YouTube.
- A million.

136
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:18,933
- A million hits?
- Yeah.

137
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:20,727
Wow, you gotta get me that link.

138
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,937
- Will do.
- The bottom line is,

139
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:25,023
things have changed since then.

140
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:27,942
You need to go back, and
you show JJ what you're made of.

141
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:31,654
Maybe you're right.
Maybe I'm just overreacting.

142
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:34,240
Hey. You got this.

143
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:37,410
- I have got this.
- You got it.

144
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:44,459
There she is!

145
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:48,713
- Oh, my little girl is home!
- Hi.

146
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:52,550
Oh, sweetheart,
four months is too long!

147
00:09:52,634 --> 00:09:54,844
- Hey.
- Hi. Why are you so tall?

148
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:57,931
Look at you! You look so great!
And we miss you so much.

149
00:09:58,014 --> 00:10:00,975
- I miss you guys, too.
- Oh, yeah? Well, not as much

150
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:02,936
- as you're about to miss shotgun.
- In your dreams.

151
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:05,563
- Ben!
- What, Mom?

152
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:07,899
Joanna always lets me sit shotgun.

153
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,360
You guys do a lot of stuff with Joanna?

154
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:13,947
- We do everything with Joanna.
- We don't do everything...

155
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,074
Take your sister's bag, be a gentleman.

156
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:18,368
You're home!

157
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:29,629
Mark! Honey, she's home!

158
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,298
Ben, will you get the phone, please?

159
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:35,760
- Yeah, sure.
- Coco Puff! Come here, buddy!

160
00:10:35,844 --> 00:10:37,053
- Sweetheart...
- Coco!

161
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:38,847
Joanna took Coco to the groomer's.

162
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:41,474
Everybody needs to look
their best for this wedding,

163
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:45,019
including Coco Puff.
Hey, Mark, she's home!

164
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:50,316
Hey,babe.
We're a full house this weekend.

165
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,360
You and Joanna are gonna have to
bunk in, I hope you don't mind.

166
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:56,072
- Oh, come on, Mom!
- Oh, Marni Olivia Olsen.

167
00:10:56,156 --> 00:11:00,410
OK. it will just be like the
slumber party I was never invited to.

168
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:03,496
I'm gonna get dinner.
Honey! She's home!

169
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:25,685
- Busted!
- Oh, you scared me! There he is!

170
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:28,938
- Come here!
- Ridgefield's legal golden boy!

171
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:31,107
- Look at you. You look gorgeous.
- Thank you.

172
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:34,152
Can you believe this? Because, Marni,
it wasn't that long ago, you remember?

173
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:37,071
We were kids up in that tree house,
swearing we'd never get married.

174
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:38,948
I guess some things change, huh?

175
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:42,243
- I'm counting on it.
- Is that my little mover and shaker?

176
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:45,079
- Baby.
- Hi, Daddy! Hi.

177
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:47,332
Oh, my gosh, you look great!
You're so thin!

178
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:51,002
I have lost a couple of pounds.
Thank you for noticing.

179
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:52,128
- You look fantastic.
- Thanks.

180
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:54,964
Joanna's back. Your mom wants
everyone downstairs. Chop-chop!

181
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:59,135
One of those. Off to the side.

182
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:03,181
And, while rolling, it is
so crucial to have one inch wide

183
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:08,853
and nine inches in length.
And you finish it just like that.

184
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:16,236
- You are a culinary wonder.
- Hey, hey. Look who I found.

185
00:12:31,626 --> 00:12:35,421
Marni, Marni, Marni.

186
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:41,594
Look at you!

187
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:47,558
- You are so beautiful!
- Thank you?

188
00:12:47,642 --> 00:12:50,937
Do you know that I have waited
so long for this moment?

189
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,313
It's finally here.

190
00:12:52,397 --> 00:12:54,732
You think you waited long? 'Cause I...

191
00:12:54,816 --> 00:12:58,403
- There's just so much to say.
- Believe me, I know.

192
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:00,571
But I don't want to do it
in front of them.

193
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:03,616
But first, let me just say

194
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,452
- how nice it is to finally...
- It's OK.

195
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:08,496
...meet you!

196
00:13:09,998 --> 00:13:12,625
- Excuse me?
- Will has told me so much about you,

197
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:16,629
but now here you are! I cannot
wait to spend the next four days

198
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:21,384
learning all about my
brand-new sister! Hugsies!

199
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:26,973
- Never mind.
- Yeah.

200
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:29,767
The salad looks good.

201
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:35,815
There he is!
Coco Puff! Come here, buddy!

202
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:40,653
Coco Puff! Come to Mommy!

203
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:45,033
- Yeah! That's my boy.
- Coco Puff, dinner time.

204
00:13:45,116 --> 00:13:47,869
Joanna, I'm not sure I feel comfortable
starting dinner without your aunt.

205
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:49,662
- I think it's very rude.
- Oh, no, no, no.

206
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:51,998
Don't worry about Aunt Mona.
She's just running late.

207
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:53,207
- OK. You ready, honey?
- Ready!

208
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:54,375
Batter up.

209
00:13:55,752 --> 00:13:57,670
I'm sorry, are we executing Dad tonight?

210
00:13:57,754 --> 00:14:00,214
You know how your father's
always been so interested

211
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:02,675
in the whole mind-body connection?

212
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:05,553
And since we can't have Will's
best man looking fat on Saturday...

213
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:07,305
- That's right.
- You do not look fat!

214
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:08,890
...I'm trying the Yamaguchi diet.

215
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:10,516
A colleague at the hospital
told me about it.

216
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,019
Most people don't realize
when they're full.

217
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:15,188
They need an empty plate to tell them.

218
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:18,232
Scientific fact:
when you wear a blindfold,

219
00:14:18,316 --> 00:14:21,402
you rely on your stomach.
I've already lost six pounds.

220
00:14:21,486 --> 00:14:23,488
And where did you go to medical school?

221
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:26,157
- Ben!
- Well, I think it's a very smart way

222
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,159
- to stay fit.
- Thank you, Joanna.

223
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:29,535
Let's eat!

224
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:36,417
Wow. So how did you two meet?

225
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:39,379
We were at this little
karaoke bar at the beach,

226
00:14:39,462 --> 00:14:43,132
and Will was onstage
doing his best Hall & Oates.

227
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:44,967
- Not my finest moment.
- Really?

228
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:47,512
- No, it wasn't.
- Ben.

229
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:49,931
He was so cute, I just had to save him.

230
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:52,850
So I got onstage
and we sang it together.

231
00:14:52,934 --> 00:14:55,853
- And she has been saving me ever since.
- That's right.

232
00:14:55,937 --> 00:14:59,649
You know, I just think it's unbelievable
that in a small town like Ridgefield

233
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,818
Will and Joanna could grow up

234
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,861
practically down the block
from each other

235
00:15:03,945 --> 00:15:06,739
and not run into each other until now.
It's funny, isn't it?

236
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:08,199
It's hilarious!

237
00:15:11,202 --> 00:15:16,457
Isn't it? I mean, that
our paths haven't crossed till now?

238
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:20,128
- Isn't that funny?
- Yeah. It's so funny!

239
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:24,757
Weird. So, Marni, Will tells me

240
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:28,219
that you work for this
big, fancy PR firm in LA?

241
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:34,392
Guilty. Actually, since you
mentioned it, I have news.

242
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:36,394
- I got a promotion.
- What?

243
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:39,313
And I am now VP of our
New York office. And I was...

244
00:15:39,397 --> 00:15:41,983
- A promotion in New York?
- Yes.

245
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:44,569
Oh, honey, congratulations!
That's fantastic!

246
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:46,446
- We're so proud of you!
- That is awesome.

247
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:49,824
You get to meet real celebrities?
Like, that is really cool!

248
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:51,784
You know, enough about me.

249
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:54,370
I'm dying to know
what you're doing. You know?

250
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:55,788
I mean, what have you been up to?

251
00:15:55,872 --> 00:16:01,043
- My life is dull by comparison.
- Oh, I doubt it.

252
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:05,173
I'm sure you keep it just as interesting
as you did in high school, right?

253
00:16:05,256 --> 00:16:09,469
I mean, I'd love to hear how your
wonderful life has turned out.

254
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:13,931
Well...

255
00:16:14,015 --> 00:16:16,476
Yeah. After my parents died,

256
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:20,521
I took a hard look at my life,
and realized I wasn't

257
00:16:20,605 --> 00:16:25,359
really making the right choices.
So I enrolled in nursing school,

258
00:16:25,443 --> 00:16:29,780
and I decided to focus all of my energy
into helping those less fortunate.

259
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:33,242
Wow. Good... Good for you.

260
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:36,204
No, "good" doesn't even
begin to describe it.

261
00:16:36,287 --> 00:16:39,207
Yeah, I kind of became obsessed
with helping people in need.

262
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:43,461
Well, since, Will and I love children.

263
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:50,259
...as an entry-level RN, they
promoted me to head clinical nurse.

264
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:51,928
I tried to put in a good word.
She wouldn't let me.

265
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:55,473
- Oh, Dad.
- Oh, Dad.

266
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:57,558
Between the hospital...
Yeah, it, actually...

267
00:16:57,642 --> 00:17:00,019
It helps build the self-esteem of...

268
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:03,231
Let's be honest, you can only
run a suicide hotline so long

269
00:17:03,314 --> 00:17:05,316
before it starts to take its toll.

270
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:07,401
- Do you still have that number?
- Ben!

271
00:17:07,485 --> 00:17:10,363
Oh, my gosh, I have been
talking about myself way too much.

272
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:12,406
- No, no, no. Baby, it's fine. Trust me.
- I, for one,

273
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:17,286
had no idea you were such a giver.

274
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:21,874
I know, right? I'm so proud of her.
I'm so proud to call you my bride.

275
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:25,169
Bride! He said it again!

276
00:17:25,253 --> 00:17:28,839
Gail! He's getting married! I know!

277
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:33,219
- I really need a refill.
- He has been saying bride.

278
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:35,805
- Today, I think it's 16...
- Anybody need anything?

279
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:39,350
- How many more days?
- Does anybody want anything?

280
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:42,520
- Of course we will. But...
- Great.

281
00:17:43,688 --> 00:17:44,730
Oh, my gosh!

282
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,573
The Lambada!

283
00:17:54,699 --> 00:17:57,868
Jeez, Mom, you scared me!

284
00:17:57,952 --> 00:18:02,790
- So that Joanna's pretty great, right?
- Yeah, almost too good to be true.

285
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:05,459
I think so, too.
I think it's her sweetness.

286
00:18:05,543 --> 00:18:06,836
You know, her genuine warmth.

287
00:18:06,961 --> 00:18:10,840
- Where is the recycling?
- Come with me, please.

288
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:14,802
There's the recycling, and...

289
00:18:16,387 --> 00:18:18,598
Wow, this looks beautiful.

290
00:18:18,681 --> 00:18:22,226
- Maybe Joanna could sleep out here.
- Marni.

291
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:28,482
Listen. How come you
didn't mention New York?

292
00:18:28,566 --> 00:18:31,152
I'm really proud of you.
That's fantastic.

293
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:35,281
Thank you. I don't know.
I think I've just been preoccupied

294
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:40,786
with the whole... Joanna thing, and...

295
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:43,039
Don't you think it's odd
that she doesn't remember me?

296
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:45,166
Ridgefield High was not that big.

297
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:47,793
I don't remember half the people
I went to high school with.

298
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:52,173
Yeah, but you're Gail Byer.
Everyone loved you.

299
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:54,008
You can't relate to what I went through.

300
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:56,510
Really? You wanna bet?

301
00:18:56,594 --> 00:19:00,723
Listen, nobody gets through
high school unscathed, Marni. Nobody.

302
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:03,768
You didn't tell me
you had problems in high school.

303
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:06,771
Because what's past is past.

304
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:11,651
Look, if you had a problem with Joanna
in the past, you can fix it now.

305
00:19:11,734 --> 00:19:12,985
Remember...

306
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:17,239
- Everyone deserves a second chance.
- ...deserves a second chance. I know.

307
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:21,994
Joanna's Aunt Mona is here!

308
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:25,164
I can't believe my
little Joanna's getting married.

309
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:27,291
- I know. It's crazy, right?
- I'm so happy for you.

310
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:30,336
Come meet the family. Aunt Mona...

311
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:36,801
...this is Will's sister, Marni.

312
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:38,678
- What a pleasure.
- Nice to meet you.

313
00:19:38,761 --> 00:19:40,888
And this is Will's mom.

314
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:45,309
- Gail?
- Ramona.

315
00:19:45,393 --> 00:19:47,311
Whoa! You guys know each other?

316
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:54,110
- Gail!
- Ramona!

317
00:19:58,114 --> 00:20:00,074
How long has it been?

318
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:02,535
Well, don't tell,
or I'll have to strangle you.

319
00:20:11,836 --> 00:20:14,213
- Who can remember?
- How do you two know each other?

320
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:18,259
- We went to school together.
- We were best friends.

321
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:21,554
Very, very close.

322
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:27,435
Wow. You look... great.

323
00:20:27,518 --> 00:20:29,520
- Stop.
- No, no, really.

324
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:32,106
You look amazing.
You haven't aged at all.

325
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:34,442
- Oh, well...
- She looks computer-generated.

326
00:20:34,525 --> 00:20:38,487
- Ben.
- Thank you. You must be Ben.

327
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:42,450
You know, I have something
that I think you will like.

328
00:20:45,536 --> 00:20:49,123
Fallout Four? This doesn't
even come out until the summer!

329
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:52,042
- What do you say, young man?
- Thank you!

330
00:20:54,712 --> 00:20:57,673
I cannot wait to go play this!
I got... I gotta go!

331
00:20:57,757 --> 00:21:01,093
Have fun. And Marni.

332
00:21:01,177 --> 00:21:04,346
You know, I think I have the right size.

333
00:21:06,891 --> 00:21:10,144
- Is this Brian Reyes?
- Brian who?

334
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:11,854
And this is from his new collection?

335
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:14,106
'Cause I thought
that it was pre-sold out.

336
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:16,609
Brian is a doll.
He always stays at my hotels.

337
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:20,821
He always stays at the Sullenger.
You own the Sullenger Hotel?

338
00:21:20,905 --> 00:21:24,366
The Sullenger Group.
Actually, we now own 14 properties.

339
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:25,910
I can't believe it myself.

340
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:28,454
I can't believe
that my mom didn't tell me

341
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:32,291
that she was friends with one of
Forbes' 100 most powerful women.

342
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:34,627
Please, that silly list
changes all the time.

343
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:36,504
Yeah, but you've been on it
for, like, ten years.

344
00:21:36,587 --> 00:21:38,798
Eleven. But, you know,
what's most important to me

345
00:21:38,881 --> 00:21:42,176
is that when someone stays at my hotel,
they feel right at home.

346
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:45,930
"Like home but better," I always say.
Which reminds me...

347
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:49,058
You two have worked
so hard on this wedding.

348
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:53,062
It would mean so much to me if you would
spend a week at any one of my resorts.

349
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:56,232
Bali, Maui, Paris.

350
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:57,608
- Yes!
- No. No.

351
00:21:57,691 --> 00:21:59,318
- Yes.
- I insist.

352
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:01,529
Now, Ramona, you know
you did not have to do all this.

353
00:22:01,612 --> 00:22:02,738
You've already done
so much for the wedding.

354
00:22:02,822 --> 00:22:05,032
Do you think I'm trying
to buy people's affection?

355
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:07,201
- Did it work?
- Yeah!

356
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:12,373
This is so exciting. I mean, doesn't
it feel like we're already family?

357
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:15,042
Let's not just stand here.
Come on in, family!

358
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:18,420
Put your feet up.
Have a drink, Ramona.

359
00:22:18,504 --> 00:22:20,631
I think we've got
some French champagne.

360
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:23,759
There are cowbells on every door,
and we have no beds.

361
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:27,263
I have 400 beds stranded
somewhere in the Indian Ocean.

362
00:22:28,973 --> 00:22:31,642
I mean, it's still beautiful.
It's Switzerland.

363
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:34,144
- I love Switzerland.
- You've never been to Switzerland.

364
00:22:34,228 --> 00:22:37,898
Yeah, but I love chocolate.
I love cheese. I love clocks!

365
00:22:37,982 --> 00:22:41,443
Well, then we all have to
spend some time at my new place.

366
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:45,364
- How about Christmas in Gstaad?
- Yes!

367
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:47,116
- We can take the jet.
- Count me in.

368
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:49,743
No way! You own your own plane?

369
00:22:49,827 --> 00:22:52,788
Oh, darling,
sometimes I think it owns me.

370
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:57,585
I am on it non-stop just flitting
from one continent to the next.

371
00:22:57,668 --> 00:23:00,379
Not to mention all the
back-and-forth with my divorce.

372
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:04,258
Michael and I have been
in litigation 14 months.

373
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:06,635
We were only married for seven, so...

374
00:23:06,719 --> 00:23:09,471
Ramona, I'm sorry.
That must be so difficult.

375
00:23:09,555 --> 00:23:11,515
Yeah, it is, but, you know,

376
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:15,394
it's nothing that a delicious piece
of whatever this is can't fix.

377
00:23:18,314 --> 00:23:21,525
Mark has been doing
this kind of program that...

378
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:26,113
As the eyes are the
window to the stomach...

379
00:23:28,324 --> 00:23:30,951
So shall we pull the curtain.

380
00:23:31,035 --> 00:23:32,411
How did you know that?

381
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:36,498
I had no idea the Yamaguchi Diet
had come to the States!

382
00:23:36,582 --> 00:23:39,335
- I simply swear by it!
- Me, too!

383
00:23:44,173 --> 00:23:49,845
Hello. Hello, darling.
Georgia King, the wedding planner.

384
00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:52,514
Geor... Georgia King
is the wedding planner?

385
00:23:52,598 --> 00:23:54,850
She is like Southern royalty.

386
00:23:54,934 --> 00:23:57,561
Every single one of our clients
wants her to do their wedding.

387
00:23:57,645 --> 00:23:59,563
Thank you, darling.

388
00:24:02,024 --> 00:24:05,945
Look at these two.
You guys are so adorable.

389
00:24:06,028 --> 00:24:09,448
Gail, doesn't that just take you
right back to when you were young?

390
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:13,911
You know, your mother may not have
told you this, but back in high school,

391
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:17,581
- she was quite the superstar.
- Oh, no, she told us. I mean, we know.

392
00:24:17,665 --> 00:24:22,544
- I... was hardly a superstar.
- You were a supernova.

393
00:24:22,628 --> 00:24:24,630
Every girl wanted
to be just like your mother.

394
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:29,468
She was prom queen. She was
homecoming queen. Cheerleading captain.

395
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:31,971
Well, not all at the same time.

396
00:24:32,054 --> 00:24:34,765
Wait. You were cheerleading
captain at Ridgefield?

397
00:24:35,099 --> 00:24:36,809
My senior year, I was varsity.

398
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:38,352
- Me, too!
- Joanna!

399
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:40,479
I was cheerleading captain
at Ridgefield!

400
00:24:40,562 --> 00:24:42,606
How come I didn't know that?

401
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:45,693
Joanna, have you ever
heard of the... Byer Flyer?

402
00:24:45,776 --> 00:24:48,862
Well, yeah, I mean, it's the
signature move of the varsity squad.

403
00:24:48,946 --> 00:24:49,989
Yeah?

404
00:24:52,116 --> 00:24:54,702
You were the "Byer" in the Byer Flyer?

405
00:24:54,785 --> 00:24:56,328
I mean, I originated the move.

406
00:24:56,412 --> 00:24:59,748
Oh, my gosh! Your mother is a legend!

407
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:01,750
I'm not a legend. I'm not a legend.

408
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:04,962
- Gator Power. Let's do it!
- Oh, no, no. They still do it?

409
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:07,881
- Go, Gators! Go, go, go, Gators!
- I haven't done it in 30 years!

410
00:25:07,965 --> 00:25:10,384
Dad, can I please
borrow your blindfold?

411
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:12,219
- Come on! Go, go, Gators!
- Get in line.

412
00:25:12,302 --> 00:25:16,348
Go, go, go, Gators! Go, go, go, Gators!

413
00:25:16,432 --> 00:25:18,392
No, I haven't done it
in such a long time!

414
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:23,522
- Go, go, go, Gators!
- Go, go, Gators! Go, go, go, Gators!

415
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:26,442
Ready? OK!

416
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:29,028
Ridgefield Gators are out tonight.

417
00:25:29,111 --> 00:25:31,864
We're gonna dribble
and fight, fight, fight!

418
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:35,075
- Yeah!
- Snap those jaws, let's begin.

419
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:37,494
Ridgefield Gators gonna win, win, win!

420
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:42,416
Go... Gators!

421
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:49,339
- Unbelievable!
- I haven't done that in 30 years!

422
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:52,551
Boy, the two of you together again.

423
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:55,179
Must feel like you're
right back at Ridgefield High.

424
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:59,266
Yes, it feels... just like old times.

425
00:26:00,017 --> 00:26:01,727
- Gator Power!
- Mom!

426
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:03,729
Yeah!

427
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:12,196
- All I want is an apology.
- You can't prove it was me.

428
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:16,492
I suppose I should commend Joanna
for changing her life

429
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:21,205
and just do what Mom says
and forget about it and move on.

430
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:26,668
Yeah. You know, that's probably a good
idea. I mean, you two are roommates now.

431
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,671
Ben!

432
00:26:29,755 --> 00:26:32,424
- Thank you.
- Let me help you.

433
00:26:32,508 --> 00:26:34,301
How gallant.

434
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:39,223
You know, Joanna is my
only family now, and...

435
00:26:40,516 --> 00:26:43,811
...it's been hard to imagine this
wedding without her parents here.

436
00:26:43,894 --> 00:26:46,730
- Of course.
- So it means the world to me to be able

437
00:26:46,814 --> 00:26:49,191
to share it with you
and your beautiful family.

438
00:26:49,358 --> 00:26:50,400
It means a lotto us, too.

439
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:55,656
- Good night.
- Good night, Ramona.

440
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:04,373
- Well, that was normal. Right?
- Yeah. You seem surprised.

441
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:07,793
- You two were friends, weren't you?
- Yeah, we were best friends.

442
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:09,586
Yeah, all the way
through grade school,

443
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:12,464
and then we were close in high school.

444
00:27:12,548 --> 00:27:15,342
Right up until our senior prom, and...

445
00:27:15,425 --> 00:27:20,097
...then she... she kind
of had a little breakdown,

446
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:22,724
and something happened, and I...

447
00:27:22,808 --> 00:27:24,268
She said she never
wanted to see me again.

448
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:26,854
I don't know what happened, really.

449
00:27:27,396 --> 00:27:30,274
Honey, it was...
That's a long time ago.

450
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:33,902
And you always say
everyone deserves a second chance.

451
00:27:33,986 --> 00:27:35,654
So stop worrying about it.

452
00:27:35,737 --> 00:27:38,240
You honestly don't
remember me from high school?

453
00:27:40,576 --> 00:27:43,579
No, I... I'm so sorry.

454
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:47,958
High school was such a blur.
Please don't take it personally.

455
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:52,754
Slumber party! Oh, look at you two.

456
00:27:52,838 --> 00:27:56,592
Now, I'm not interrupting
any pillow fights, am I?

457
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:59,511
- Not yet.
- I just came to say goodnight

458
00:27:59,595 --> 00:28:01,513
to my lady.

459
00:28:01,597 --> 00:28:04,183
- My favorite!
- Yeah?

460
00:28:04,266 --> 00:28:07,603
- Does that smell good?
- Don't you just love this?

461
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:09,313
I'll give you two a minute.

462
00:28:22,576 --> 00:28:25,871
Wow. Love what
you've done with the place.

463
00:28:27,414 --> 00:28:33,128
Oh, my curtains!
Did you know I made those from scratch?

464
00:28:33,212 --> 00:28:36,089
Yeah. I thought you said
you were going to bed.

465
00:28:38,175 --> 00:28:41,178
My room is a little crowded right now.

466
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:44,890
I thought I would just hang up here
with you, if that's cool.

467
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:48,018
Yeah. It's cool.

468
00:28:50,479 --> 00:28:51,563
Thanks.

469
00:28:56,902 --> 00:28:58,904
I thought you said his sister was hot.

470
00:29:01,907 --> 00:29:03,325
Oh, I accept.

471
00:29:04,326 --> 00:29:06,870
- Mark, do you remember Denmark?
- Of course I do.

472
00:29:06,954 --> 00:29:08,163
- Yeah.
- I was there.

473
00:29:08,247 --> 00:29:10,332
I know. Do you remember
the room service?

474
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:12,417
No, I really don't.

475
00:29:12,501 --> 00:29:15,462
- Hey! Good morning, sunshine.
- Hey.

476
00:29:15,545 --> 00:29:19,132
Oh, Coco Puff, there's my boy!

477
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:23,929
Coco Puff, no!
We do not growl at guests.

478
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:26,765
I am so sorry. He'll warm up to you.

479
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:29,476
He probably just doesn't recognize you.

480
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:31,853
Yeah. I get that a lot.

481
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:36,108
Check it out, Marni. The Hawaii trip.

482
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:39,152
Remember when you got nailed
in the face by that baby octopus.

483
00:29:39,236 --> 00:29:42,155
You were like...
It wouldn't come off!

484
00:29:42,239 --> 00:29:45,993
She was so sad. She was so brave,
though. She was so brave.

485
00:29:47,536 --> 00:29:52,457
- Let's turn the page.
- Hello, we need to go right now

486
00:29:52,541 --> 00:29:54,584
because we have a lotto do
before our dance lesson.

487
00:29:54,668 --> 00:29:57,254
- Dance lesson?
- If the bride and groom want dancing,

488
00:29:57,337 --> 00:29:59,298
we're gonna give them dancing. Hey!

489
00:29:59,381 --> 00:30:01,466
That means you need
to pick up Grandma.

490
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:03,969
Oh, honey, she can't wait to see you.

491
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:06,388
- Come on, Coco. Let's go.
- She really can't.

492
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:09,182
That was all she would talk about
the other day at the mall, Marni.

493
00:30:09,266 --> 00:30:10,892
You go shopping with our grandma?

494
00:30:10,976 --> 00:30:13,979
Oh, yeah. Bunny and I,
we're like sorority sisters.

495
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:16,815
All right, ladies, come on. We're
wastin' time. Let's go. Let's do it.

496
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:21,445
- Yes! I'm so excited about our dance.
- Come on, Marni. Chop-chop.

497
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:23,405
Marni, seriously, don't worry about it.

498
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:27,159
You'll have plenty of time to wash up
before my bridal shower this afternoon.

499
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:32,789
So, Will, how'd you pop the question?

500
00:30:34,124 --> 00:30:36,710
I... I proposed in the
tree house, actually.

501
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:40,339
- Our tree house?
- It's my wedding gift to Joanna.

502
00:30:40,422 --> 00:30:42,424
I'm having it moved from
Mom and Dad's to our new place,

503
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:44,676
- once it's finally built.
- You're moving the tree...?

504
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,261
You can't move the tree house, Will.

505
00:30:46,345 --> 00:30:48,889
You and I built that with Dad
with our bare hands.

506
00:30:48,972 --> 00:30:50,849
- That's like Olsen family history.
- OK, Marni, how about

507
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:53,727
when you come in town,
you can come visit it at our place.

508
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:58,690
- OK? How's that?
- Honey, our song! It's fate.

509
00:31:17,459 --> 00:31:19,127
Stop!

510
00:31:23,632 --> 00:31:27,552
Sorry. I thought that
plastic bag was a kitten.

511
00:31:29,262 --> 00:31:32,432
- What?
- Check it out. Ridgefield High.

512
00:31:32,516 --> 00:31:36,436
So many... fond memories.

513
00:31:37,479 --> 00:31:40,273
But, you know,
if I knew then what I know now,

514
00:31:40,357 --> 00:31:42,651
I would've done a lot
of things differently.

515
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:46,071
How about you, Joanna? Any regrets?

516
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:49,199
Well, actually, yeah.

517
00:31:49,282 --> 00:31:52,369
I mean, if I could start
all over, I would probably

518
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:56,415
get a head start on my community service
and charitable outreach programs.

519
00:31:58,291 --> 00:32:03,171
I would've had a boyfriend. You probably
had lots of boyfriends, right, Joanna?

520
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:08,009
- No, I wouldn't say "lots."
- I heard that one of the cheerleaders

521
00:32:08,093 --> 00:32:10,720
had a different boyfriend
in each school in the district,

522
00:32:10,804 --> 00:32:14,307
and that when she'd bleed one dry,
she'd just move on to the next one.

523
00:32:14,391 --> 00:32:17,144
Hey, Joanna, you were
on the cheerleading squad.

524
00:32:17,227 --> 00:32:18,728
Do you remember who that was?

525
00:32:18,812 --> 00:32:21,273
- What's your point, Marni?
- No point.

526
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:25,944
Just wondered if she remembered who
this low self-esteem gold-digger was.

527
00:32:26,027 --> 00:32:28,613
I heard she even dated the Wilson
High School principal for a while.

528
00:32:28,697 --> 00:32:29,865
She did not!

529
00:32:34,161 --> 00:32:38,290
I mean, that's just a rumor I heard
that Judy Karbash made up

530
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:41,418
because she was jealous
of said cheerleader.

531
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:44,713
Do you guys mind
if I change the music?

532
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:02,731
Love this song! Don't
you guys just love this song?

533
00:33:43,188 --> 00:33:44,814
Joanna!

534
00:33:51,321 --> 00:33:55,784
I said, "'Cougar?' I'm old enough
to be your grandmother!"

535
00:33:58,411 --> 00:34:02,457
Well, we better get going if we wanna
make it on time for our dance lesson.

536
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:04,292
Bunny, can I help you get ready?

537
00:34:04,376 --> 00:34:06,127
- That would be delightful.
- OK.

538
00:34:06,211 --> 00:34:08,380
You know what? You've done enough.
I'll help her get ready.

539
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:10,632
Don't be silly. I'm happy
to help Grandma Bunny.

540
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:15,387
Well, she's my Grandma Bunny, by blood.
I've got this.

541
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:18,557
They're fighting over me.

542
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:21,810
So, Grandma, is there
anything I can help you with?

543
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:25,188
Here, dear. They were a little loose.

544
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:27,566
We can't have them
falling out on the dance floor.

545
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:31,486
- I don't think... I don't know how.
- They're just dentures! Get over it.

546
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:34,197
Now, and be sure and press hard, dear.

547
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:37,784
We need a tight seal.
I might be kissing later.

548
00:34:39,244 --> 00:34:43,582
- OK.
- There we go. OK.

549
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:51,756
- Oh, seriously?
- Oh, dear!

550
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:55,427
I can fix that.

551
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:58,847
- Now, hold still.
- Grandma, no!

552
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:05,395
I really gotta give you credit.
You've got this whole good girl act

553
00:35:05,478 --> 00:35:07,731
- down to a T, don't you?
- Excuse me?

554
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:10,525
You even had me believing
that you didn't remember who I was.

555
00:35:10,609 --> 00:35:12,736
<i>But We Are The Champions?</i>

556
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:15,739
You really showed your true colors,
didn't you, JJ?

557
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:17,407
Joanna.

558
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:20,118
Tim!

559
00:35:22,329 --> 00:35:23,913
Tim!

560
00:35:23,997 --> 00:35:28,668
- Wow! You look well!
- Thank you.

561
00:35:28,752 --> 00:35:31,713
Thank you for saying that. You... Wow.

562
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:35,050
I wasn't expecting to see you.
What... how...

563
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:37,594
Well, you look...
You changed your hair.

564
00:35:37,677 --> 00:35:41,431
No, I didn't, but Tim, this is Will,
Marni and Grandma Bunny.

565
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:45,769
- We go way back.
- Way back. Seattle Space Needle.

566
00:35:46,603 --> 00:35:48,980
- It was great seeing you. It's awesome.
- Oh, my gosh.

567
00:35:49,064 --> 00:35:51,399
I mean, but, unfortunately,
we've gotta get going. So...

568
00:35:51,483 --> 00:35:53,860
We don't need to rush. They're
not gonna start without you guys.

569
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:56,529
Let's talk to Tim
and hear about way back.

570
00:35:56,613 --> 00:36:00,241
What is your phone number? Someone
keeps blocking your number on my phone.

571
00:36:00,325 --> 00:36:03,495
- I think it's a glitch.
- It's 555-0172.

572
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:07,999
That's my cell. I'm also on Facebook.
And the Twitter.

573
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:10,126
What about you, Joanna? Do you Twitter?

574
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:13,171
Can we Twitter together?
You wanna, maybe... I have a pool.

575
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:14,881
You wanna catch a movie sometime?

576
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:18,635
Tim, Will and I are getting married.

577
00:36:19,052 --> 00:36:21,721
- I hadn't heard about this.
- Yup, this Saturday.

578
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:24,974
This Saturday?

579
00:36:25,058 --> 00:36:28,311
That is great!
That is so soon for a marriage.

580
00:36:29,062 --> 00:36:31,606
That is so soon. Lovebirds.

581
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:35,527
That is great.
Gotta give you one of these, then.

582
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:39,322
Married to... And you're
sure that's this Saturday?

583
00:36:39,406 --> 00:36:43,952
Hey, man. Keep it real.
And you got a terrific girl here. Move.

584
00:36:46,371 --> 00:36:49,499
Bye, Tim. Call me!

585
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:53,336
That was awkward.
We dated in college.

586
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:55,797
Long story. Right.
We're not gonna go into that.

587
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:58,591
- Let's go dance!
- You guys dated?

588
00:37:00,844 --> 00:37:02,595
Here they are. Hi!

589
00:37:02,679 --> 00:37:07,350
It's happening! Marni!
Did you get a haircut?

590
00:37:07,434 --> 00:37:13,314
You did. Let me see!
It's... It's cute.

591
00:37:13,398 --> 00:37:16,484
It's cute, bangs. You haven't
had bangs since high school.

592
00:37:16,568 --> 00:37:20,071
- I know.
- It's cute. How was Grandma's?

593
00:37:20,155 --> 00:37:25,577
It was fun... when Grandma wasn't
fawning all over her new BFF, Joanna.

594
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:30,206
Honey. Your grandma loves you.

595
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:32,667
Don't turn everything
into a competition.

596
00:37:32,751 --> 00:37:37,297
Ho/a, everyone! I am so sorry I'm late.

597
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:40,383
Oh, look at this!

598
00:37:41,843 --> 00:37:44,596
Oh, Gail, when was the
last time we danced together?

599
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:46,890
Could it have been... prom?

600
00:37:49,434 --> 00:37:50,560
Is that what you're wearing?

601
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:54,689
- Yes. Why?
- You know what I love

602
00:37:54,773 --> 00:37:57,400
about your look is it's so sporty.

603
00:37:57,484 --> 00:37:59,569
- Thank you.
- So American.

604
00:38:03,865 --> 00:38:07,535
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
your wedding extraordinator,</i>

605
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:11,372
<i>Miss Georgia King!</i>

606
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:32,435
Hi!

607
00:38:37,524 --> 00:38:38,608
Whack!

608
00:38:55,959 --> 00:38:58,169
Heart!

609
00:39:02,966 --> 00:39:04,717
- <i>Brava.</i>
- Yes!

610
00:39:06,261 --> 00:39:09,722
<i>Bonjour. Guten tag. Hola.
Aloha. Konichiwa.</i>

611
00:39:09,806 --> 00:39:14,727
Hi, y'all. I'm Georgia King.
And I am your wedding extraordinator.

612
00:39:16,938 --> 00:39:19,816
And this lovely man
to my right is the owner

613
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:24,362
of this Off-Broadway dance studio,
and my personal helper, Timothy.

614
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:28,783
- Oh, look, it's Tim!
- I want you to think of me

615
00:39:28,867 --> 00:39:31,744
as the engine room to your Love Boat.

616
00:39:31,828 --> 00:39:35,999
And our first "port of call"
is the crucial wedding dance.

617
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:40,420
Now, since Will and Joanna first
said "I love you" at the Mardi Gras,

618
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:45,300
I have choreographed a Brazilian
Carnival Lambada dance number.

619
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:47,719
Now, this dance number
is the forbidden dance

620
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:50,763
that bestows good luck
and fertility on the happy couple.

621
00:39:50,847 --> 00:39:55,018
And now, I'm gonna teach it to
all y'all. Do you get what I'm sayin'?

622
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:59,314
All right! Let's get this party started!

623
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:10,033
Oh, Marni! I'm so sorry.
We were expecting more people.

624
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:11,743
It's fine. Don't worry about it.

625
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:14,621
- Olsen!
- Charlie! You made it!

626
00:40:14,704 --> 00:40:17,624
Hey, I'm sorry I'm late.
The flight was delayed...

627
00:40:17,707 --> 00:40:20,376
Don't even worry about it.
Marni, you remember Charlie, right?

628
00:40:30,887 --> 00:40:32,472
Sorta.

629
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:35,892
Come here, you!
Come here, man.

630
00:40:35,975 --> 00:40:37,644
- Hey!
- Hey.

631
00:40:37,727 --> 00:40:38,770
Good to see you.

632
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:41,064
- You, too.
- Hi!

633
00:40:41,147 --> 00:40:42,607
Marni!

634
00:40:44,317 --> 00:40:47,737
Wow. You look... grown-up!

635
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:50,949
That's what I did. Couldn't stop it.

636
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:53,326
At last!

637
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:56,621
For every lovely lady,
there is a gentleman.

638
00:40:56,704 --> 00:40:59,582
Marcie, I want you
to dance with Charlie.

639
00:40:59,666 --> 00:41:02,627
And, you two, I want you to work
on that bride and groom dance.

640
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:05,129
Right over there.
I'm gonna come help you.

641
00:41:05,213 --> 00:41:07,674
Just right that way, that's it.

642
00:41:07,757 --> 00:41:10,593
Remember, you're a swan. Long neck.

643
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:16,975
You might wanna bend
your knees a little bit there.

644
00:41:17,058 --> 00:41:19,352
It's... it's the Lambada,
not the foxtrot.

645
00:41:19,435 --> 00:41:21,813
- OK.
- He's acting like it's a foxtrot.

646
00:41:23,606 --> 00:41:25,149
So, what am I doing?

647
00:41:26,275 --> 00:41:30,905
I'll just teach you what we learned.
It's... your left hand,

648
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:35,618
foot, goes... forward,
together, back and together.

649
00:41:35,702 --> 00:41:38,579
Forward and together,
back and together.

650
00:41:38,663 --> 00:41:40,832
Don't be intimidated.
I've had two hours more practice.

651
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:41,916
OK. Thank you.

652
00:41:43,126 --> 00:41:45,128
Mind if I drive for a while?

653
00:41:57,598 --> 00:41:59,350
I mean, what is she trying to prove?

654
00:41:59,434 --> 00:42:01,477
- Well, if I had her body...
- You'd what?

655
00:42:01,602 --> 00:42:04,856
I'd shut my mouth before
the next stupid thing comes out.

656
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:09,569
Don't try this at home.
It's strictly for professionals.

657
00:42:13,281 --> 00:42:15,116
Roar!

658
00:42:18,411 --> 00:42:22,040
Right and left, and right and left.

659
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:46,606
Bang,bang!

660
00:42:58,618 --> 00:43:03,331
Forget this. Mark, "Byer Flyer,"
on my count. Spot me.

661
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:06,626
- What?
- Tim!

662
00:43:11,964 --> 00:43:14,050
- You ready?
- No!

663
00:43:28,523 --> 00:43:32,026
Two scoops of crazy
with a side of coo-coo-cachoo.

664
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:35,113
I guess this means
you didn't get your apology?

665
00:43:35,196 --> 00:43:37,907
I don't think there's
gonna be an apology.

666
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:39,951
But she remembers me.

667
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:43,079
Oh, yeah, and this is all
just part of her little act.

668
00:43:43,162 --> 00:43:46,749
Everybody loves a good story, and
that's exactly what she's giving 'em.

669
00:43:46,833 --> 00:43:49,043
She has got Will totally brainwashed.

670
00:43:49,127 --> 00:43:51,963
Come on, Marni.
Don't you think you're overreacting?

671
00:43:52,797 --> 00:43:54,549
He's giving her the tree house.

672
00:43:56,425 --> 00:43:58,052
What?

673
00:44:13,192 --> 00:44:16,529
Ben! I need to leave a little early
for baseball practice.

674
00:44:16,612 --> 00:44:20,658
I'm gonna run by Ramona's hotel!
We'll leave in about five minutes, OK?

675
00:44:21,742 --> 00:44:25,663
We gotta save him, Benny.
Will has protected us his entire life.

676
00:44:25,746 --> 00:44:29,667
- Now, it's our turn to protect him.
- What are we supposed to do, Marni?

677
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:32,211
He's getting married
in, like, 48 hours.

678
00:44:32,295 --> 00:44:37,341
Ben. Ben. In PR, 48 hours is a lifetime.

679
00:44:37,425 --> 00:44:40,303
All we have to do
is isolate the problem,

680
00:44:40,386 --> 00:44:43,472
calculate a plan
and institute a solution.

681
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:46,851
We gotta get him alone.

682
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:51,856
Hey, Will. What are you doing right now?
Can I talk to you?

683
00:44:51,939 --> 00:44:54,483
Actually, can it wait?
Because Joanna's gonna be back soon,

684
00:44:54,567 --> 00:44:56,694
- and I wanna sneak in a quick run here.
- No way!

685
00:44:56,777 --> 00:45:00,448
I was just thinking that... that I need
to sneak in a run. I'll come with you.

686
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:02,950
Yeah, OK, great, Marn,
but I'm warning you,

687
00:45:03,075 --> 00:45:04,785
I'm training for a marathon.
Five miles OK?

688
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:08,289
This is so weird.
It's like we're twins!

689
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:11,959
I'm actually training for a triathlon,
which is a little bit harder,

690
00:45:12,043 --> 00:45:14,462
but five miles is perfect.

691
00:45:18,507 --> 00:45:21,385
- Charlie! Are you ready?
- Charlie?

692
00:45:26,182 --> 00:45:28,559
- You all right?
- Oh, yeah.

693
00:45:28,643 --> 00:45:32,271
No, I'm just stretching my hamstrings,
you know. Safety first.

694
00:45:36,067 --> 00:45:37,693
There's someone at the door. Hold on.

695
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:42,114
- Hi.
- Hi.

696
00:45:42,198 --> 00:45:45,660
Ramona, I'm sorry
to just sort of barge in.

697
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:49,789
I just, I was kind of hoping...
Do you have a minute?

698
00:45:49,872 --> 00:45:53,626
- Oh, yes, absolutely. Come in.
- Wonderful. Thanks.

699
00:45:55,670 --> 00:45:57,421
- I'm on the phone.
- Oh, you know what?

700
00:45:57,505 --> 00:46:00,758
I need to use the restroom.
It was a long drive.

701
00:46:00,841 --> 00:46:03,678
It's up the stairs and to the left.

702
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:06,013
Wow. OK.

703
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:10,893
Hi. Sorry, Will's mother...

704
00:46:56,063 --> 00:47:00,401
No! No! No.

705
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:06,032
No!

706
00:47:08,409 --> 00:47:09,618
No!

707
00:47:14,165 --> 00:47:15,624
Oh, come on.

708
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:36,687
Well, your lawyer has the paperwork,
so... that's that.

709
00:47:44,904 --> 00:47:46,405
Ramona?

710
00:47:48,616 --> 00:47:50,451
Is everything OK?

711
00:47:51,369 --> 00:47:53,162
Oh, yes.

712
00:47:53,245 --> 00:47:58,209
You know, Ridgefield gives me
such terrible allergies.

713
00:48:01,879 --> 00:48:03,839
Did you take a shower?

714
00:48:05,299 --> 00:48:09,512
Yes. Yes, I did.

715
00:48:10,679 --> 00:48:15,726
I did. I did.
I hope you don't mind. I...

716
00:48:15,810 --> 00:48:20,064
Really I just came by because...

717
00:48:20,147 --> 00:48:22,566
...I believe in closure.

718
00:48:22,650 --> 00:48:26,946
And I just wanted to come by here

719
00:48:27,029 --> 00:48:31,784
and tell you that
whatever happened between us

720
00:48:31,867 --> 00:48:36,497
is in the past,
and as far as I'm concerned...

721
00:48:37,998 --> 00:48:39,834
...it's over.

722
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:44,255
Well, I appreciate that.
Good for you, Gail. Brava.

723
00:48:44,338 --> 00:48:47,258
So we're good, right? We're...

724
00:48:49,093 --> 00:48:51,095
- Is that good?
- Yes.

725
00:48:51,178 --> 00:48:53,139
Good.

726
00:48:58,018 --> 00:49:02,690
I should take that, so...
Thanks for stopping by and...

727
00:49:05,693 --> 00:49:09,280
- See you later.
- Alligator.

728
00:49:12,908 --> 00:49:14,702
Yes.

729
00:49:17,455 --> 00:49:21,459
Sven? <i>Guten</i> tag. How are you?

730
00:49:33,846 --> 00:49:35,973
- How you holding up, champ?
- Oh, great!

731
00:49:36,056 --> 00:49:38,851
I love it. I love running!

732
00:49:41,353 --> 00:49:45,691
Hey, Will. Earlier, at the house,
I wanted to talk to you about Joanna.

733
00:49:45,774 --> 00:49:47,902
Actually, I'm glad
you're bringing this up.

734
00:49:47,985 --> 00:49:49,570
- You are? Good.
- Yeah, sure. I mean, Marn,

735
00:49:49,695 --> 00:49:51,989
- how can we not talk about this, right?
- Right! Because

736
00:49:52,072 --> 00:49:54,408
she's not just marrying you,
Will, she's marrying all of us.

737
00:49:54,533 --> 00:49:56,827
- We all have to put up with her.
- But I couldn't do it

738
00:49:56,911 --> 00:49:58,412
unless I knew I had
your support on this thing.

739
00:49:58,496 --> 00:50:02,416
In that case, Will, William...

740
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:04,585
- Cramp!
- I know what you're about to say,

741
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:08,172
and it means the world to me
that you'd actually open up your heart

742
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:10,424
and bring her into
our family like that. Seriously.

743
00:50:10,549 --> 00:50:12,760
What's going on, kids? I thought
we were training for a marathon.

744
00:50:12,885 --> 00:50:15,846
- Charlie!
- Hey, you cool with this pace, Marni?

745
00:50:15,930 --> 00:50:16,931
- Yeah!
- You sure?

746
00:50:17,056 --> 00:50:18,849
- Oh, yeah. It's good.
- In that case,

747
00:50:18,933 --> 00:50:20,559
- what do you say we sprint to the end!
- Let's do it.

748
00:50:21,268 --> 00:50:24,104
- Yeah? Let's go!
- Yeah? Yeah...

749
00:50:24,230 --> 00:50:26,065
Come on!

750
00:50:31,111 --> 00:50:33,280
Maybe I'll give you guys a head start.

751
00:50:43,582 --> 00:50:43,665
Come on, honey, come on.
Here, sit here.

752
00:50:43,666 --> 00:50:46,210
Come on, honey, come on.
Here, sit here.

753
00:50:46,293 --> 00:50:49,547
- Watch my carpet.
- Make the burning stop!

754
00:50:49,630 --> 00:50:52,216
I'll get Marni one of my back pills.
One of those babies,

755
00:50:52,299 --> 00:50:55,094
- she'll be able to taste sunlight.
- Gross!

756
00:50:55,177 --> 00:50:58,055
<i>- Go get me my rag bag.
- Mam, what happened to you'?</i>

757
00:50:58,138 --> 00:51:00,933
- I took a shortcut.
- Through a woodchipper?

758
00:51:01,016 --> 00:51:03,477
No, through an ant bed.

759
00:51:03,561 --> 00:51:05,896
- I knew we shouldn't have left her.
- Oh, Charlie. You're here.

760
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:09,400
I'm here, actually.
Blurred vision. That can't be good.

761
00:51:09,483 --> 00:51:11,652
No. The ants carried away her contacts.

762
00:51:12,611 --> 00:51:14,989
- What kind of ants were they?
- I forgot to ask them,

763
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:18,534
but I will next time. And, really, this
is not a big deal, you guys. I'm fine.

764
00:51:18,617 --> 00:51:20,703
She's not. The bad news
is she hurt her leg.

765
00:51:20,786 --> 00:51:22,580
The good news is she can't
feel it 'cause of the ant bites.

766
00:51:22,663 --> 00:51:25,416
Mom, stop being so dramatic. It's not...

767
00:51:25,874 --> 00:51:28,210
- That did not sound good.
- You know what?

768
00:51:28,294 --> 00:51:30,337
That was completely my fault.
I shouldn't have been standing here.

769
00:51:30,421 --> 00:51:33,257
- I'm sorry. I can take care of these...
- No, no, no, no...

770
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:37,469
OK, I'm actually gonna
get you to a safety zone.

771
00:51:37,553 --> 00:51:38,929
That looked like it hurts.

772
00:51:39,013 --> 00:51:41,223
You guys will not believe
what just happened. I think my...

773
00:51:41,307 --> 00:51:43,851
- So itchy everywhere!
- What is going on?

774
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:46,186
- Marni fell into an ant bed.
- Oh, no.

775
00:51:46,270 --> 00:51:48,772
Well, with this many bites,
she could go into anaphylactic shock.

776
00:51:48,856 --> 00:51:51,483
- You're the nurse. What should we do?
- We need lard. Stat!

777
00:51:51,567 --> 00:51:56,030
- I need lard, stat!
- Who are you talking to?

778
00:52:11,211 --> 00:52:14,590
There you go. Get her, Coco!
Get her, Coco!

779
00:52:27,186 --> 00:52:30,606
Honey, stop with the picking.
You look fine.

780
00:52:30,689 --> 00:52:33,233
How lucky for me, that you kept
my glasses from tenth grade.

781
00:52:33,317 --> 00:52:37,363
Well, I can't get your contacts
until tomorrow morning.

782
00:52:37,446 --> 00:52:39,740
I thought you'd like to see.

783
00:52:43,535 --> 00:52:46,497
Look at them, Mom!
They look like pimples!

784
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:50,668
And my bangs? It's literally like
nothing has changed since high school.

785
00:52:50,751 --> 00:52:54,880
Marni, I know.
But they're just ant bites,

786
00:52:54,963 --> 00:52:57,299
and they will go away.

787
00:52:57,383 --> 00:53:00,135
And, before you know it,
everything's gonna be fine,

788
00:53:00,219 --> 00:53:02,137
and you're gonna live
happily ever after.

789
00:53:03,389 --> 00:53:06,767
"Happily ever after"
is in fairy tales, Mom.

790
00:53:06,892 --> 00:53:10,354
High school was a horror movie.
This weekend is the sequel.

791
00:53:10,437 --> 00:53:13,607
It's times like this
that I like to then go back...

792
00:53:13,691 --> 00:53:15,401
Mom, do you always have to offer up

793
00:53:15,484 --> 00:53:18,779
some sweet little perfect
nugget of self-help advice?

794
00:53:18,904 --> 00:53:20,656
Because I'm just
really not in the mood.

795
00:53:20,739 --> 00:53:24,451
Well, someday you're gonna
appreciate my wisdom.

796
00:53:39,299 --> 00:53:44,888
Marni, being a mom is hard.
There is no rule book.

797
00:53:44,972 --> 00:53:47,307
Every day, you wake up and hope...

798
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:50,352
You have to trust your instincts and
hope you're not messing up your kids.

799
00:53:51,478 --> 00:53:56,066
It's a lot of pressure. And I feel a
profound sense of responsibility that...

800
00:53:56,150 --> 00:54:02,156
...that everything I do greatly affects
you and your brothers' lives.

801
00:54:02,489 --> 00:54:04,950
And that's why I want you to know

802
00:54:05,033 --> 00:54:08,787
that what I'm about to do is deeply,

803
00:54:08,871 --> 00:54:12,416
deeply wrong!

804
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:16,837
- Mom, what are you doing?
- Oh, you know I hate being late!

805
00:54:17,671 --> 00:54:20,924
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

806
00:54:21,008 --> 00:54:22,509
Yes!

807
00:54:29,016 --> 00:54:33,270
Bonjour, <i>guten</i> tag, ho/a, aloha,
konichiwa! Hi, y'all.

808
00:54:33,353 --> 00:54:35,898
Welcome to Joanna's bridal shower.

809
00:54:40,819 --> 00:54:44,948
Now, listen, ladies.
Will and Joanna first met on the beach.

810
00:54:45,032 --> 00:54:49,953
So it seems only fitting that we begin
their wedding story in a sea of love.

811
00:54:50,037 --> 00:54:55,334
<i>Viva</i> la romance. Enjoy it, enjoy it.

812
00:54:55,417 --> 00:54:58,796
A little over the top. I'm gonna
just check on your grandma, OK?

813
00:54:58,879 --> 00:54:59,880
- OK.
- You OK?

814
00:55:00,005 --> 00:55:02,633
- Yep.
- All right. Hi, Mom.

815
00:55:10,641 --> 00:55:13,060
Marni, there you are!
I was getting worried.

816
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:16,688
Girls, girls,
this is Will's sister, Marni.

817
00:55:16,772 --> 00:55:19,525
She actually graduated
from Ridgefield High with us.

818
00:55:19,608 --> 00:55:21,652
Oh, right. I remember you.

819
00:55:21,735 --> 00:55:24,363
We were in... homeroom together.

820
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:30,702
History, fifth period, Mrs Barker.
But who's keeping track?

821
00:55:34,206 --> 00:55:35,999
So when are you guys due?

822
00:55:36,083 --> 00:55:37,417
- August 23rd.
- August 23rd.

823
00:55:37,501 --> 00:55:40,671
Wow. Is that such a weird coincidence?

824
00:55:40,754 --> 00:55:42,506
Oh, no, no. We planned it in college.

825
00:55:46,552 --> 00:55:47,553
Oh, you're serious.

826
00:55:47,636 --> 00:55:49,596
And Joanna won't be far behind.

827
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:51,765
You know you will!

828
00:55:51,849 --> 00:55:54,017
Stop talking about my stomach!

829
00:55:54,101 --> 00:55:57,062
So, how about you, Marni?
Any little ones?

830
00:55:58,272 --> 00:56:00,524
Not that I know of.

831
00:56:04,611 --> 00:56:08,782
And now I'd like to give
a special thanks to my bridesmaids.

832
00:56:08,866 --> 00:56:11,660
Thank you for standing
by my side this weekend.

833
00:56:11,743 --> 00:56:15,122
Here's just a small token
of my appreciation.

834
00:56:15,205 --> 00:56:19,459
- That is so sweet.
- Oh, so sweet.

835
00:56:19,543 --> 00:56:21,587
I will cherish this forever.

836
00:56:25,799 --> 00:56:27,968
I hope you like it.

837
00:56:31,471 --> 00:56:35,726
I told your mother Olivia
was a terrible middle name.

838
00:56:38,437 --> 00:56:40,355
Grandma, does it ever get any easier?

839
00:56:40,439 --> 00:56:43,108
- What, dear?
- This!

840
00:56:43,191 --> 00:56:47,487
- Life, everything.
- Marni, don't let the way

841
00:56:47,613 --> 00:56:50,908
those girls treated you bring you down.

842
00:56:50,991 --> 00:56:53,243
We are our experiences.

843
00:56:53,327 --> 00:56:56,580
That terrible time made you
the woman you are today.

844
00:56:56,663 --> 00:56:59,666
You're right.

845
00:56:59,791 --> 00:57:02,336
You're absolutely right, Grandma.

846
00:57:03,503 --> 00:57:04,671
I'll be right back.

847
00:57:08,342 --> 00:57:12,262
- Amuse-bouche?
- Not since college.

848
00:57:15,974 --> 00:57:18,602
Hey, sis. Isn't this a blast?

849
00:57:18,685 --> 00:57:22,856
Look, sis,
I've had enough of this game.

850
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:25,067
You can make this
real easy on yourself.

851
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:26,777
All you have to do is apologize.

852
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:29,905
If you apologize, I'll keep
my mouth shut about everything.

853
00:57:29,988 --> 00:57:32,032
Fine. Sorry.

854
00:57:33,075 --> 00:57:36,495
That's it? That...
That's your big apology?

855
00:57:36,578 --> 00:57:40,207
All right. Well,
you've made your trundle.

856
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:43,710
Maybe Will should lie in it
and hear a few of the details.

857
00:57:45,963 --> 00:57:49,800
I'd think very carefully
before I did anything crazy, sis.

858
00:57:49,883 --> 00:57:52,928
Who do you honestly think
your brother will believe?

859
00:57:53,011 --> 00:57:56,431
No. You're not doing this to me again.

860
00:57:56,515 --> 00:57:58,809
I am not the same four-eyed,
acne-covered girl

861
00:57:58,892 --> 00:58:00,143
you pushed around in high school.

862
00:58:00,227 --> 00:58:04,898
Really? Have you taken
a look in the mirror lately?

863
00:58:30,298 --> 00:58:33,051
I gotta admit, the first
few rounds went to Joanna.

864
00:58:33,135 --> 00:58:35,971
She played some very good hands.
Very good. But I'm glad.

865
00:58:36,054 --> 00:58:39,891
It made me realize that we have to step
it up, take it to a whole new level.

866
00:58:39,975 --> 00:58:44,688
Whoa. "We?"
No, she's your arch nemesis.

867
00:58:44,771 --> 00:58:47,983
I'm not gonna be a part
of your evil plan.

868
00:58:48,066 --> 00:58:49,651
- I'll give you 20 bucks.
- Done.

869
00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:54,281
Will may not believe his own sister,

870
00:58:54,364 --> 00:58:57,492
but I think he'll have a hard time
not believing his own eyes.

871
00:58:59,578 --> 00:59:00,829
Start digging-

872
00:59:04,249 --> 00:59:06,626
Hey, where is Mom?
It's getting kind of late.

873
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:08,837
She said she got tied up in town.
I'm sure she's on her way.

874
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:11,298
Well, with the way she drives,
she'll be here in a second.

875
00:59:11,423 --> 00:59:13,008
- She drives like a maniac.
- I know.

876
00:59:13,091 --> 00:59:14,968
We're co-hosting this party.
She's got to be here any minute.

877
00:59:15,052 --> 00:59:16,094
She will.

878
00:59:22,267 --> 00:59:24,978
Honey, you look amazing!

879
00:59:27,814 --> 00:59:28,940
Stay right there.

880
00:59:29,691 --> 00:59:32,778
Wow! Mom, you look great.

881
00:59:39,743 --> 00:59:40,744
Thank you.

882
00:59:42,621 --> 00:59:44,122
Hey!

883
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:49,002
Thank you.

884
00:59:54,508 --> 00:59:59,888
Sadly, my dress was ruined, and I had to
find a replacement on very short notice.

885
01:00:00,013 --> 01:00:04,643
Quick, somebody call Us <i>Weekly.</i>
Let's find out "Who Wore It Best?"

886
01:00:07,104 --> 01:00:08,522
Joanna!

887
01:00:08,605 --> 01:00:12,567
- You look divine!
- Thank you.

888
01:00:15,862 --> 01:00:18,115
Hi, guys.

889
01:00:18,198 --> 01:00:21,660
I'm sorry. What is he doing here?

890
01:00:21,743 --> 01:00:23,370
Who?

891
01:00:24,913 --> 01:00:26,832
Sausages.

892
01:00:26,915 --> 01:00:30,752
Look, I hope you guys
don't mind that I invited Tim.

893
01:00:30,836 --> 01:00:34,131
Yeah, well, I sorta do.

894
01:00:34,214 --> 01:00:36,800
It's just, it's so awkward
to come to these things alone,

895
01:00:36,883 --> 01:00:40,053
and you said that you and Tim
were never serious,

896
01:00:40,137 --> 01:00:42,013
so I figured that
it wouldn't be a big deal.

897
01:00:43,765 --> 01:00:46,434
I thought...
You know what? You're right.

898
01:00:46,518 --> 01:00:48,145
I should have asked. I'm sorry.

899
01:00:48,228 --> 01:00:51,898
I'll go ask Tim to leave.
And that... That will be fine.

900
01:00:52,023 --> 01:00:54,568
You know what? I don't really care.
It's... I'm used to...

901
01:00:54,651 --> 01:00:56,695
being the solo girl, so it's...

902
01:00:56,778 --> 01:00:58,488
Marni, you don't have to ask him
to leave. I mean, Tim can stay.

903
01:00:58,572 --> 01:01:01,366
- It's not that big of a deal.
- Really?

904
01:01:05,996 --> 01:01:09,374
You know, I... I will be right back.

905
01:01:09,457 --> 01:01:11,835
- Thank you.
- No biggie.

906
01:01:23,013 --> 01:01:25,015
- Hi.
- Hey.

907
01:01:26,933 --> 01:01:29,311
- Let's move that.
- I think that's mine.

908
01:01:30,145 --> 01:01:32,689
- Danger...
- It goes to the right.

909
01:01:32,772 --> 01:01:36,276
Danger... Sharp.

910
01:01:36,401 --> 01:01:38,195
- Yes. What are you doing?
- Yes.

911
01:01:38,278 --> 01:01:40,280
I'm just... I'm creating
a safe zone for you.

912
01:01:40,405 --> 01:01:42,949
Oh, for me? I won't! I'm not gonna...

913
01:01:43,074 --> 01:01:45,076
- I'm... I'm totally safe, I promise.
- You won't what?

914
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:49,039
Safe? My lip, my head and my big toe

915
01:01:49,122 --> 01:01:54,127
would beg to differ with that statement.
There is nothing safe about you, Olsen.

916
01:01:54,211 --> 01:01:55,712
- I got you three times?
- Three times.

917
01:01:55,795 --> 01:01:58,173
- I'm so embarrassed.
- One time was my big toe,

918
01:01:58,256 --> 01:02:00,508
- my favorite feature on my body.
- Oh, no.

919
01:02:00,592 --> 01:02:02,802
- You have so much flesh on it.
- It still hurts, to be honest. I know.

920
01:02:02,928 --> 01:02:04,554
It is the big one.

921
01:02:06,514 --> 01:02:10,310
I believe this seat is reserved for Tim.
Are you a Tim?

922
01:02:10,393 --> 01:02:12,520
- No.
- Yeah, it's a wedding.

923
01:02:12,604 --> 01:02:14,314
You have to sit in the seats
that they reserve for you.

924
01:02:14,397 --> 01:02:16,107
It's not like a
normal restaurant or anything.

925
01:02:16,191 --> 01:02:19,236
- That's my seat, so...
- Yeah. Sorry.

926
01:02:20,654 --> 01:02:22,697
- Yeah.
- I have a drink, so you should...

927
01:02:22,781 --> 01:02:25,617
- I'm gonna head over to this table.
- OK, I'll...

928
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:28,828
- I'm a "Charlie," by the way.
- I don't know where the Charlies are.

929
01:02:28,912 --> 01:02:29,955
It's not my responsibility.

930
01:02:30,038 --> 01:02:31,414
I'll be with the Charlies,
if you need me.

931
01:02:31,498 --> 01:02:34,501
I'll come to over to... after.

932
01:02:41,424 --> 01:02:43,760
Wow. Thanks, Tim.

933
01:02:44,719 --> 01:02:46,388
What is it?

934
01:02:46,471 --> 01:02:50,308
- It's an umbrella drink.
- I see that.

935
01:02:50,392 --> 01:02:52,936
Joanna and I went to Cancun once.

936
01:02:59,609 --> 01:03:03,530
What are you doing
over here all by yourself?

937
01:03:03,613 --> 01:03:09,202
Oh, nothing.
Just missing Mom and Dad.

938
01:03:09,286 --> 01:03:11,204
I still can't believe
they aren't here for this.

939
01:03:11,288 --> 01:03:14,916
I mean, I always thought Daddy
would walk me down the aisle.

940
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:20,171
I know, sweetheart. I miss them, too.

941
01:03:28,722 --> 01:03:30,390
Anything else bothering you?

942
01:03:33,226 --> 01:03:36,146
- Aunt Mona...
- Yeah?

943
01:03:36,229 --> 01:03:39,149
Have you ever done something
you wish you could take back?

944
01:03:39,232 --> 01:03:41,318
My last two marriages.

945
01:03:41,401 --> 01:03:44,654
And I'm starting
to rethink these heels.

946
01:03:46,656 --> 01:03:47,991
Why?

947
01:03:49,743 --> 01:03:51,828
I made a mistake.

948
01:03:51,911 --> 01:03:55,665
Big, big mistake, and I...

949
01:03:55,749 --> 01:03:57,751
I don't... I don't
know what to do about it.

950
01:03:57,834 --> 01:04:02,005
You're human, Joanna.
Making mistakes is part of what we do.

951
01:04:02,088 --> 01:04:04,883
It's how we go about
fixing them that matters.

952
01:04:06,593 --> 01:04:12,599
I know that whatever you do,
it will be the right thing. OK?

953
01:04:13,933 --> 01:04:18,688
I'm so proud of you.
And I know your parents are, too.

954
01:04:18,772 --> 01:04:21,191
Yeah, I'm not so sure about that.

955
01:04:22,359 --> 01:04:23,233
<i>Bonsoir, guten abend,
buenas noches, shalom, konbanwa,</i>

956
01:04:23,234 --> 01:04:28,281
<i>Bonsoir, guten abend,
buenas noches, shalom, konbanwa,</i>

957
01:04:28,365 --> 01:04:31,076
good evening. I'm Georgia King!

958
01:04:36,706 --> 01:04:39,542
Will, I have a big
surprise for the groom.

959
01:04:39,626 --> 01:04:42,128
Tomorrow, you and Joanna
are going to give yourselves

960
01:04:42,253 --> 01:04:44,381
to one another through wedding vows.

961
01:04:44,464 --> 01:04:48,093
But tonight, Joanna is going
to pledge herself to you...

962
01:04:48,176 --> 01:04:50,261
...in song.

963
01:04:54,057 --> 01:04:56,601
Honey, what are they doing?
I'm frightened.

964
01:05:01,940 --> 01:05:03,191
Hi.

965
01:05:04,901 --> 01:05:08,696
This is for you, Will.
I love you so much, baby.

966
01:05:18,665 --> 01:05:19,874
You have got to be kidding me.

967
01:05:33,179 --> 01:05:34,848
Finally, something she can't do.

968
01:05:36,182 --> 01:05:38,184
Forget this!

969
01:05:41,980 --> 01:05:43,440
WOW!

970
01:06:18,475 --> 01:06:21,394
<i>My girls are wicked, wicked
We're slammin' and we're jammin'</i>

971
01:06:21,478 --> 01:06:24,397
<i>So kick it, kick it
This bride is feeiin' butterflies inside</i>

972
01:06:24,481 --> 01:06:27,609
<i>Can't be denied
I'll make 'em bow, make 'em wow</i>

973
01:06:27,692 --> 01:06:29,360
<i>It's my wedding day
Kiss my man</i>

974
01:06:29,444 --> 01:06:30,987
<i>Throw some rice
And a big buffet</i>

975
01:06:31,070 --> 01:06:33,364
<i>From now on
we're gonna live so happily</i>

976
01:06:33,448 --> 01:06:35,783
<i>My way'll make you J-U-M-P</i>

977
01:06:40,079 --> 01:06:41,080
<i>Check it out</i>

978
01:06:41,164 --> 01:06:43,625
<i>Homies want a man
but there's no man like mine</i>

979
01:06:43,708 --> 01:06:46,211
I cannot believe my brother
is falling for this.

980
01:06:46,294 --> 01:06:48,463
<i>He's a miggida-miggida-miggida
miggida mac daddy</i>

981
01:06:48,546 --> 01:06:52,342
Oh, honey, this is not my first
barbecue, rodeo or canoe trip.

982
01:06:52,425 --> 01:06:55,178
I know true love when I see it,
and this, my dear sweet bridesmaid,

983
01:06:55,261 --> 01:06:58,556
is true love. Now, come on!
This is a party! Have fun!

984
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:01,893
<i>Jump, uh-huh, uh-huh
Jump, jump</i>

985
01:07:04,812 --> 01:07:07,815
I love you! I love you so much!

986
01:07:07,899 --> 01:07:09,484
Joanna.

987
01:07:15,573 --> 01:07:18,952
OK, OK, OK. I knew we were
getting a new daughter,

988
01:07:19,035 --> 01:07:22,163
I had no idea we were
getting a rap star!

989
01:07:24,415 --> 01:07:28,545
- Bravo!
- Will, I love you.

990
01:07:28,628 --> 01:07:31,881
Your mother and I
could not be more proud of you.

991
01:07:31,965 --> 01:07:36,803
Not only are you one heck of a lawyer,
you are compassionate, you are caring,

992
01:07:36,928 --> 01:07:39,973
and, most importantly, you're honest.

993
01:07:40,056 --> 01:07:45,061
To see that you have found someone
with all those same qualities

994
01:07:45,144 --> 01:07:49,065
makes me the happiest man
in this room.

995
01:07:49,148 --> 01:07:52,902
Joanna, while technically
I'm the best man,

996
01:07:52,986 --> 01:07:56,489
you should know that tomorrow
the real best man

997
01:07:56,614 --> 01:07:59,325
will be standing right next to you.

998
01:08:01,995 --> 01:08:03,955
- To Will and Joanna.
- To Will and Joanna.

999
01:08:04,038 --> 01:08:05,999
- To Will and Joanna.
- To Will and Joanna.

1000
01:08:11,296 --> 01:08:13,089
- Will?
- Yeah?

1001
01:08:13,172 --> 01:08:15,008
I have something I need
to tell you. I haven't...

1002
01:08:15,091 --> 01:08:16,759
- Sure.
- I haven't been totally honest...

1003
01:08:16,843 --> 01:08:18,094
ls there anyone else
who would like to make a toast?

1004
01:08:18,177 --> 01:08:20,680
- Tim does!
- Oh, no.

1005
01:08:23,516 --> 01:08:25,101
OK.

1006
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:36,613
Joanna, congratulations
on a very special evening.

1007
01:08:36,696 --> 01:08:40,199
I just wanted to say tonight
is an amazing occasion,

1008
01:08:40,325 --> 01:08:42,619
and it's special for many reasons.

1009
01:08:42,702 --> 01:08:44,662
One of them being that
Joanna and I finally

1010
01:08:44,746 --> 01:08:46,497
get to share
a rehearsal dinner together.

1011
01:08:47,707 --> 01:08:51,377
Of course I would rather it
had been our rehearsal dinner,

1012
01:08:51,461 --> 01:08:53,087
but beggars can't be choosers.

1013
01:08:54,380 --> 01:08:59,218
But in all seriousness, Joanna,

1014
01:08:59,344 --> 01:09:05,350
after many, many, many,
many hours of therapy,

1015
01:09:05,516 --> 01:09:07,560
I know now why you
didn't show up that night.

1016
01:09:07,685 --> 01:09:10,480
- The two of you were engaged?
- And I even know that it's my fault.

1017
01:09:10,563 --> 01:09:12,899
It was right after college.
I was young and immature.

1018
01:09:13,066 --> 01:09:14,859
That's OK.

1019
01:09:17,195 --> 01:09:20,281
I missed you, Joanna.

1020
01:09:21,407 --> 01:09:23,826
I miss your voice, I miss the...

1021
01:09:23,910 --> 01:09:27,580
Oh, God, she used to make
this sound when we would...

1022
01:09:27,664 --> 01:09:29,123
When we would snuggle.

1023
01:09:32,585 --> 01:09:34,545
Remind me to change my phone number.

1024
01:09:34,629 --> 01:09:36,923
I got cold feet. He wigged out!

1025
01:09:37,006 --> 01:09:39,050
- How could you not tell me this?
- I'm sorry.

1026
01:09:39,133 --> 01:09:41,052
I'd like to dedicate a song to you.

1027
01:09:42,512 --> 01:09:43,763
This was our song.

1028
01:09:46,432 --> 01:09:50,895
<i>Overnight scenes
Dinner and wine</i>

1029
01:09:50,978 --> 01:09:53,064
<i>Saturday girls</i>

1030
01:09:53,147 --> 01:09:57,402
<i>I was never in love
Never had the time</i>

1031
01:09:57,485 --> 01:10:00,697
<i>In my hustle and hurry world</i>

1032
01:10:00,780 --> 01:10:03,783
<i>Laughing myself to sleep</i>

1033
01:10:03,866 --> 01:10:06,327
<i>Waking up lonely</i>

1034
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:12,041
<i>I needed someone to hold me, Joanna</i>

1035
01:10:12,125 --> 01:10:18,965
<i>Girl, you're every woman
in the world to me</i>

1036
01:10:20,675 --> 01:10:26,013
<i>You're my fantasy
You're my reality</i>

1037
01:10:26,097 --> 01:10:31,894
<i>Girl, you're every woman
in the world to me</i>

1038
01:10:32,645 --> 01:10:34,647
<i>You're everything I see</i>

1039
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:39,318
<i>You're everything to me
Oh, yeah</i>

1040
01:10:49,912 --> 01:10:51,789
Thanks, Tim...

1041
01:10:56,502 --> 01:10:58,004
...for that.

1042
01:10:59,505 --> 01:11:05,094
And now we have a special video
for Joanna from the bridal party.

1043
01:11:05,178 --> 01:11:07,680
A video? Did you know about this?

1044
01:11:07,805 --> 01:11:10,933
Engaged, Joanna? To that guy?

1045
01:11:25,072 --> 01:11:26,866
<i>OK, I'm ready.</i>

1046
01:11:28,326 --> 01:11:32,663
<i>Hi, I'm JJ Clark and
I'm a senior at Ridgefield High.</i>

1047
01:11:32,789 --> 01:11:36,375
<i>We're supposed to tell all you losers
what life is like in 2002</i>

1048
01:11:36,501 --> 01:11:38,920
<i>so you can see how much
things have changed.</i>

1049
01:11:39,045 --> 01:11:40,171
How did they find this?

1050
01:11:40,254 --> 01:11:43,216
<i>Wanna know what life's like
for an 18-year-old in high school?</i>

1051
01:11:43,341 --> 01:11:45,927
<i>Life is easy.</i>

1052
01:11:46,052 --> 01:11:47,720
This was for the time capsule.

1053
01:11:47,845 --> 01:11:50,348
They said no one would
see it for 50 years.

1054
01:11:50,431 --> 01:11:53,309
<i>I mean, sure you gotta
work at it to be number one.</i>

1055
01:11:53,392 --> 01:11:57,730
<i>But high school's not brain surgery.
It's more like prison.</i>

1056
01:11:59,690 --> 01:12:02,235
<i>And, in this prison, I'm the warden.</i>

1057
01:12:02,360 --> 01:12:05,404
<i>So it's my job to keep
all the inmates in line.</i>

1058
01:12:06,572 --> 01:12:09,408
<i>Oh, look, here's one now.</i>

1059
01:12:10,743 --> 01:12:12,995
<i>In high school, only the strong survive.</i>

1060
01:12:13,079 --> 01:12:15,998
<i>The meek shall not inherit the earth.</i>

1061
01:12:18,334 --> 01:12:20,753
<i>Moo!</i>

1062
01:12:25,049 --> 01:12:26,884
<i>High school's a four-year sentence.</i>

1063
01:12:26,968 --> 01:12:29,929
<i>They don't let you out early
for good behavior.</i>

1064
01:12:30,054 --> 01:12:33,391
<i>So, take it from me,
it's better to be bad.</i>

1065
01:12:35,101 --> 01:12:36,686
<i>Out of my Way!</i>

1066
01:12:49,574 --> 01:12:54,036
Will. I'm so sorry.

1067
01:12:54,120 --> 01:12:59,083
I was a stupid kid, and you know
that's not who I am any more.

1068
01:12:59,166 --> 01:13:01,460
No...

1069
01:13:01,586 --> 01:13:04,797
See, I don't think I know
who anyone is anymore, Joanna.

1070
01:13:04,881 --> 01:13:07,466
So I'm just gonna get some air here.

1071
01:13:10,970 --> 01:13:15,850
Wait! Wait, don't...
Where are you going?

1072
01:13:15,975 --> 01:13:17,143
Will?

1073
01:13:29,780 --> 01:13:31,574
Still no answer?

1074
01:13:31,657 --> 01:13:34,201
What a mess. Maybe we should
head home, see if Will's there.

1075
01:13:34,327 --> 01:13:35,578
- OK.
- Come on, Bunny.

1076
01:13:35,661 --> 01:13:36,871
Ben, let's get the car.

1077
01:13:38,039 --> 01:13:39,415
Let's go.

1078
01:13:41,125 --> 01:13:43,961
Oh, wait...
Miss, don't forget your video.

1079
01:13:45,463 --> 01:13:47,757
- Your video? What...
- I'm sorry.

1080
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:52,637
I just wanted Will to know the truth.
I was trying to protect him.

1081
01:13:53,804 --> 01:13:56,599
Mom, I know you said to put it
behind me, but I guess I just couldn't.

1082
01:14:00,436 --> 01:14:03,522
- I'll get the car.
- I'll go see if I can find Will.

1083
01:14:06,192 --> 01:14:07,902
Oh, Marni, what have you done?

1084
01:14:12,949 --> 01:14:14,492
We'll talk about this at home.

1085
01:14:16,953 --> 01:14:18,621
OK.

1086
01:14:47,316 --> 01:14:49,360
Just go away! OK?

1087
01:14:51,237 --> 01:14:53,280
Look, I didn't intend for that to be...

1088
01:14:53,364 --> 01:14:57,910
You have got a lot of nerve.
You know that?

1089
01:14:58,035 --> 01:15:00,663
I'm sorry, I've got a lot of nerve?

1090
01:15:00,746 --> 01:15:03,249
Because you're the one
who came in here

1091
01:15:03,332 --> 01:15:05,501
pretending like
nothing had ever happened.

1092
01:15:05,584 --> 01:15:07,294
Pretending like we didn't
even know each other.

1093
01:15:07,378 --> 01:15:11,674
And Tim? How did
you know about that?

1094
01:15:11,757 --> 01:15:14,552
I didn't know Tim was a freak.
None of us did.

1095
01:15:14,635 --> 01:15:17,346
Please. That's why you invited him.

1096
01:15:19,974 --> 01:15:21,892
But that video?

1097
01:15:23,352 --> 01:15:25,229
Now, that was genius.

1098
01:15:26,230 --> 01:15:31,777
You know... I really
underestimated you.

1099
01:15:31,861 --> 01:15:36,449
I thought we could start over, but no.

1100
01:15:36,532 --> 01:15:39,368
You were so completely stuck in the past

1101
01:15:39,452 --> 01:15:41,245
that you just couldn't let it go,
could you?

1102
01:15:41,328 --> 01:15:45,416
Hey, I wanted a real apology,
and I deserved one.

1103
01:15:45,499 --> 01:15:48,502
- It was high school.
- You don't get to belittle this.

1104
01:15:48,586 --> 01:15:52,339
Do you have any idea what all
those years of torment did to me?

1105
01:15:52,423 --> 01:15:53,883
Every day after school,

1106
01:15:53,966 --> 01:15:57,636
I came home feeling horrible
about myself thanks to you.

1107
01:15:57,720 --> 01:16:00,681
You can't just ruin someone's life
and pretend like it didn't happen.

1108
01:16:00,765 --> 01:16:04,602
You just ruined my life!
Do you get that?

1109
01:16:05,311 --> 01:16:08,022
The fact that you're
standing here right now,

1110
01:16:08,105 --> 01:16:13,194
asking me to feel sorry for you,
is priceless.

1111
01:16:16,155 --> 01:16:18,824
Oh, I'm sorry.
Are you walking away from me?

1112
01:16:21,035 --> 01:16:24,622
Nice work. Like mother, like daughter?

1113
01:16:24,705 --> 01:16:27,416
- Excuse me?
- Your daughter just ruined

1114
01:16:27,500 --> 01:16:29,960
what should have been
the happiest night of Joanna's life.

1115
01:16:30,044 --> 01:16:32,171
Just broke her heart, just like that.

1116
01:16:32,254 --> 01:16:33,756
Sound familiar?

1117
01:16:35,049 --> 01:16:36,801
Did you see the video?

1118
01:16:36,884 --> 01:16:40,513
I did. Nice timing, too,
at the rehearsal dinner.

1119
01:16:40,596 --> 01:16:42,765
Did you...?

1120
01:16:44,767 --> 01:16:49,563
- I'm not doing this in here.
- Fine with me. Let's go.

1121
01:16:55,611 --> 01:16:57,071
Marni!

1122
01:16:58,781 --> 01:17:00,449
Marni!

1123
01:17:09,458 --> 01:17:12,920
- Are you insane?
- What do you think?

1124
01:17:13,045 --> 01:17:16,048
I think my brother was smart
to get out when he did.

1125
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:24,682
Oh, kitty likes to scratch.

1126
01:17:24,765 --> 01:17:27,059
Well, two can play at this game.

1127
01:17:37,278 --> 01:17:38,612
Warm-up.

1128
01:17:38,696 --> 01:17:40,865
- Just gettin' loose.
- Yeah?

1129
01:17:48,789 --> 01:17:53,419
Presents! Don't you just love this?

1130
01:17:54,712 --> 01:17:58,924
Marni, let's just... not do that.

1131
01:17:59,425 --> 01:18:01,969
No, no, no! Marni, please don't!

1132
01:18:02,052 --> 01:18:05,306
That was a wedding gift.
It cost a fortune! Don't...

1133
01:18:05,389 --> 01:18:08,267
Don't do it. Just... Marni?

1134
01:18:08,350 --> 01:18:10,269
One less thank-you note to send.

1135
01:18:18,068 --> 01:18:20,738
You are so gonna regret that.

1136
01:18:23,407 --> 01:18:26,243
I always wished I was
strong enough to stand up to you.

1137
01:18:26,327 --> 01:18:28,871
But you know what I
finally realized today?

1138
01:18:28,954 --> 01:18:31,248
I don't need to stand up to you.

1139
01:18:31,332 --> 01:18:34,877
It's not worth it.
You're a liar, and you're a phony.

1140
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:36,837
My family's better off without you.

1141
01:18:36,921 --> 01:18:39,215
Will is better off without you.

1142
01:18:40,132 --> 01:18:43,719
I'm done with you. My feet hurt.

1143
01:18:58,817 --> 01:19:02,696
- Yeah!
- Stop it!

1144
01:19:02,821 --> 01:19:04,949
What are you doing, Joanna?

1145
01:19:05,032 --> 01:19:08,410
I came back in here to see if you
were OK. I was concerned about you.

1146
01:19:08,494 --> 01:19:10,871
I was worried about you,
but from the looks of it,

1147
01:19:10,955 --> 01:19:13,207
I would say that you are more than
capable of taking care of yourself.

1148
01:19:13,332 --> 01:19:16,085
I just can't believe
that I fell for that.

1149
01:19:16,168 --> 01:19:18,212
That whole Meals on Wheels,
Mother Teresa act.

1150
01:19:18,295 --> 01:19:22,091
You are so good, and I'm so stupid
because I fully believed you!

1151
01:19:22,174 --> 01:19:24,093
I thought I knew exactly
who you were. Do you know that?

1152
01:19:24,176 --> 01:19:28,555
- You do know who I am, Will! You do!
- Yes, Joanna, I do know who you are.

1153
01:19:29,640 --> 01:19:32,101
You're a bully.
You're a liar. You are...

1154
01:19:32,184 --> 01:19:33,852
- An emotional terrorist!
- You stay out of this, Marni!

1155
01:19:33,978 --> 01:19:35,437
Do you know that you are
just as much to blame?

1156
01:19:35,521 --> 01:19:38,732
- No, Will, I needed to...
- No... No! Stop talking to me!

1157
01:19:38,816 --> 01:19:43,153
Going behind my back,
helping to orchestrate this thing,

1158
01:19:43,237 --> 01:19:45,781
how could you do that to me?
How could you do that to me?

1159
01:19:45,864 --> 01:19:47,283
What is wrong with both of you?

1160
01:19:47,366 --> 01:19:52,788
I'm sorry, Will. I'm sorry.
I never meant to hurt you.

1161
01:19:52,871 --> 01:19:56,000
I wanted to tell you the truth
about who I was back then. I swear.

1162
01:19:56,083 --> 01:19:58,836
You don't get it, do you?
No, you don't get it.

1163
01:19:58,919 --> 01:20:02,172
You still don't get it. No, because I
don't care who you were in high school.

1164
01:20:02,256 --> 01:20:05,801
I don't care that you were engaged.
I don't care about anything!

1165
01:20:05,884 --> 01:20:10,014
I care that you lied to me about it!
You lied to me!

1166
01:20:11,557 --> 01:20:15,644
You lied to me. And who was I
supposed to be marrying tomorrow?

1167
01:20:15,728 --> 01:20:18,355
Now, who is that? Is that the girl
that I sang karaoke with on the beach?

1168
01:20:18,439 --> 01:20:21,191
'Cause I liked that girl.
I liked that girl so much.

1169
01:20:21,275 --> 01:20:24,403
Or the warden of Ridgefield High School?

1170
01:20:28,490 --> 01:20:33,996
Wait! Will, please don't!
Please! Wait!

1171
01:20:37,416 --> 01:20:40,836
You have been playing me since
the moment you walked in my house.

1172
01:20:40,919 --> 01:20:43,464
- Playing you?
- Why? What happened between us?

1173
01:20:43,547 --> 01:20:45,841
- Tell me.
- You honestly don't remember?

1174
01:20:45,924 --> 01:20:47,384
I remember everything!

1175
01:20:47,468 --> 01:20:50,095
You don't remember
that we were best friends,

1176
01:20:50,179 --> 01:20:52,598
and then all through high school,
every single time,

1177
01:20:52,681 --> 01:20:55,267
- I was runner-up to you?
- Runner-up to me?

1178
01:20:55,351 --> 01:20:57,936
- Ramona, it wasn't a competition.
- Of course it wasn't.

1179
01:20:58,062 --> 01:21:02,399
- You always won.
- I won because they voted for me!

1180
01:21:02,483 --> 01:21:05,694
Do you remember cheerleading?
You made me try out.

1181
01:21:05,778 --> 01:21:08,405
You got on the squad.
I got laughed out the door.

1182
01:21:08,489 --> 01:21:10,616
Oh, come on. You were great!

1183
01:21:10,699 --> 01:21:12,701
Oh, please. And let's
not forget about Grease.

1184
01:21:12,785 --> 01:21:15,454
You knew how badly
I wanted to be Sandy.

1185
01:21:15,579 --> 01:21:17,706
But no, of course
you just had to audition.

1186
01:21:18,374 --> 01:21:20,959
I always wanted to be
in a musical, Ramona. Always.

1187
01:21:21,043 --> 01:21:24,880
Oh, please. You don't even sing.
You were already prom queen.

1188
01:21:24,963 --> 01:21:28,133
You were already head cheerleader.
Drama was supposed to be mine.

1189
01:21:28,217 --> 01:21:29,968
But no, you didn't think about me.

1190
01:21:30,052 --> 01:21:32,679
All you cared about,
when you got to high school, was you.

1191
01:21:32,763 --> 01:21:36,475
Oh, what was I supposed to do, Ramona?
Slow down so you could catch up?

1192
01:21:36,558 --> 01:21:38,852
- That's mean.
- Don't push me.

1193
01:21:38,936 --> 01:21:40,396
Don't you...

1194
01:21:45,484 --> 01:21:47,653
Are you insane?

1195
01:21:49,279 --> 01:21:53,450
After all that, you stole
Richie Phillips from me!

1196
01:21:53,534 --> 01:21:56,245
Richie Phillips? From high school?

1197
01:21:56,328 --> 01:22:00,082
- I was in love with him!
- You were in love with him?

1198
01:22:00,165 --> 01:22:01,750
And you went to the prom with him.

1199
01:22:01,834 --> 01:22:04,837
- He asked me, Ramona!
- You were my friend.

1200
01:22:04,962 --> 01:22:07,047
You were supposed to say no!

1201
01:22:07,131 --> 01:22:09,299
That's when I knew
I could never count on you.

1202
01:22:09,383 --> 01:22:13,554
I promised myself I would never let
anyone make me feel the way you did.

1203
01:22:13,637 --> 01:22:15,264
You know what? I should thank you.

1204
01:22:15,347 --> 01:22:18,350
If it weren't for you,
I wouldn't have worked so hard,

1205
01:22:18,475 --> 01:22:20,436
and I wouldn't have
achieved what I have.

1206
01:22:20,519 --> 01:22:22,855
Well, good for you.

1207
01:22:22,938 --> 01:22:25,691
Come off it. it just
makes you crazy that I've...

1208
01:22:25,816 --> 01:22:28,318
...that I've done all this
and that I look so good.

1209
01:22:28,402 --> 01:22:31,196
You know what, Ramona?
Honestly, I'm proud of you.

1210
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:33,782
I am proud of what
you've accomplished in your life.

1211
01:22:33,866 --> 01:22:38,620
I think you've done amazingly.
But my family is my accomplishment.

1212
01:22:38,704 --> 01:22:41,290
So I'm not jealous of you.
I have a family.

1213
01:22:41,373 --> 01:22:43,959
They love me. I'm happy!

1214
01:22:44,042 --> 01:22:47,629
Well, happiness isn't everything.

1215
01:22:50,048 --> 01:22:52,634
OK. I'm outta here.

1216
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:56,472
I was jealous. You had it all.

1217
01:22:56,555 --> 01:23:01,560
You were pretty, you were smart,
everyone wanted to be your friend.

1218
01:23:02,728 --> 01:23:06,273
Just seeing you the other night
with all your family just...

1219
01:23:06,356 --> 01:23:11,320
...reminded me of...
My marriages haven't worked out,

1220
01:23:11,403 --> 01:23:14,573
and Joanna's all I have.

1221
01:23:14,698 --> 01:23:16,909
Now, you want to take her away, too.

1222
01:23:17,034 --> 01:23:19,244
And I knew that would happen
as soon as I found out

1223
01:23:19,328 --> 01:23:21,705
that she was marrying your son.

1224
01:23:25,417 --> 01:23:28,921
I'm sorry, Ramona. Honestly.

1225
01:23:29,755 --> 01:23:33,008
And I shoulda been
a better friend, obviously.

1226
01:23:33,091 --> 01:23:35,260
I knew what I was doing.

1227
01:23:35,385 --> 01:23:38,931
I was so busy

1228
01:23:39,014 --> 01:23:42,893
being Gail Byer
and everything that that meant.

1229
01:23:42,976 --> 01:23:45,145
I just... I was insensitive.

1230
01:23:45,229 --> 01:23:48,232
I wasn't a good friend. And I'm sorry.

1231
01:23:55,364 --> 01:23:59,576
I can't believe I got
a makeover because of you.

1232
01:23:59,660 --> 01:24:02,287
- You did?
- Of course I did!

1233
01:24:02,412 --> 01:24:04,456
I almost got hair extensions.

1234
01:24:06,041 --> 01:24:08,544
Your hair flips around,
and I was jealous.

1235
01:24:08,627 --> 01:24:10,671
Oh, I'm so glad.

1236
01:24:13,924 --> 01:24:16,134
I feel like I can breathe again.

1237
01:24:16,218 --> 01:24:20,264
Really? I can't breathe!
I'm underwater!

1238
01:24:23,225 --> 01:24:25,394
What is going on out here?

1239
01:24:31,108 --> 01:24:34,152
I'm very disappointed
with the behavior I saw tonight.

1240
01:24:35,487 --> 01:24:37,406
I don't pretend
to have the slightest clue

1241
01:24:37,489 --> 01:24:40,450
about how things work in the girl world.

1242
01:24:41,910 --> 01:24:44,454
To be perfectly honest,
it frightens and confuses me.

1243
01:24:44,538 --> 01:24:47,165
But here's what I do know.

1244
01:24:47,249 --> 01:24:49,918
A wedding is a time
for a family to come together.

1245
01:24:50,002 --> 01:24:54,172
But, for whatever reason, this wedding
is tearing our family apart.

1246
01:24:54,881 --> 01:24:56,592
Will is missing.

1247
01:24:56,675 --> 01:24:59,261
Ramona's out searching
the streets for Joanna.

1248
01:24:59,344 --> 01:25:02,514
This weekend is a disaster.
And I, for one, have had it.

1249
01:25:02,598 --> 01:25:05,684
You two are completely out of control.

1250
01:25:06,268 --> 01:25:08,520
But nothing!

1251
01:25:14,484 --> 01:25:16,028
You're grounded. Go to your rooms.

1252
01:25:25,412 --> 01:25:26,955
What is it, Coco Puff?

1253
01:25:30,250 --> 01:25:31,668
What is it?

1254
01:26:00,864 --> 01:26:02,532
Oh, no.

1255
01:26:03,867 --> 01:26:05,243
No.

1256
01:26:07,245 --> 01:26:11,416
Joanna, don't do it. Don't...

1257
01:26:12,584 --> 01:26:15,003
Joanna, put down the spray cheese.

1258
01:26:16,088 --> 01:26:19,716
It's not worth it.
There are so many carbs.

1259
01:26:20,425 --> 01:26:23,512
What difference does it make?

1260
01:26:23,595 --> 01:26:26,765
It's not like
I'm getting married anymore.

1261
01:26:29,559 --> 01:26:33,647
I am an awful person.

1262
01:26:34,940 --> 01:26:36,775
Hey, remember me?

1263
01:26:36,858 --> 01:26:39,236
I'm the one who ruined
your rehearsal dinner.

1264
01:26:39,319 --> 01:26:44,116
- Think I'm the awful person.
- Marni, stop. Just...

1265
01:26:44,199 --> 01:26:46,451
Just stop apologizing.

1266
01:26:47,285 --> 01:26:50,205
I deserved it.

1267
01:26:50,288 --> 01:26:53,583
I deserve all of it!

1268
01:26:57,379 --> 01:27:00,090
Hey! OK, wait. Joanna.

1269
01:27:00,173 --> 01:27:03,260
Hand that over. Give her here.

1270
01:27:03,343 --> 01:27:06,346
Why don't we share?
Hey, that's nice.

1271
01:27:06,430 --> 01:27:08,890
Let's see. Looks... It looks good.

1272
01:27:08,974 --> 01:27:12,811
That's right, we can share that.
Looks good.

1273
01:27:22,487 --> 01:27:25,782
I just spent so many years,

1274
01:27:25,866 --> 01:27:30,203
so many years trying to
distance myself from the person I was.

1275
01:27:32,914 --> 01:27:38,545
I just wanted to be a person
my parents were proud of, you know?

1276
01:27:38,628 --> 01:27:41,173
Hey-

1277
01:27:43,842 --> 01:27:48,555
I'm sure your parents
would be very proud of you.

1278
01:27:50,891 --> 01:27:52,601
Yeah, they would've been proud of me

1279
01:27:52,684 --> 01:27:56,855
if I would've apologized to you the
moment you walked through that door.

1280
01:27:59,566 --> 01:28:02,277
I just didn't want Will
or your parents to know

1281
01:28:02,360 --> 01:28:05,363
how awful I was back then.

1282
01:28:06,615 --> 01:28:09,367
I love them all so much.

1283
01:28:12,037 --> 01:28:16,792
And it's been such a long time
since I've had a real family.

1284
01:28:16,875 --> 01:28:19,711
I just didn't wanna lose them.

1285
01:28:19,795 --> 01:28:22,172
I panicked.

1286
01:28:22,255 --> 01:28:25,634
You panicked? I freaked out.

1287
01:28:25,717 --> 01:28:29,471
I went all... Marni dearest on you guys.

1288
01:28:32,891 --> 01:28:36,228
You're never gonna lose them.
They adore you.

1289
01:28:38,188 --> 01:28:40,816
You fit into my family better than I do.

1290
01:28:40,899 --> 01:28:43,235
Well, that's not true.

1291
01:28:44,236 --> 01:28:47,531
But I think the reason why they love me

1292
01:28:47,614 --> 01:28:51,576
is because they really miss you.

1293
01:28:55,205 --> 01:28:57,249
Look, Marni,

1294
01:28:57,374 --> 01:29:01,586
I don't expect you to ever forgive me,

1295
01:29:01,670 --> 01:29:07,551
but I do want you to know that
I am truly sorry.

1296
01:29:13,598 --> 01:29:16,309
Would you mind saying
that just one more time,

1297
01:29:16,393 --> 01:29:22,357
- just, like, slower or something?
- I'm sorry, Marni, for being so evil.

1298
01:29:22,440 --> 01:29:26,820
For... For pushing you
onto that basketball court.

1299
01:29:26,903 --> 01:29:30,323
For... Oh, gosh, for everything.

1300
01:29:31,491 --> 01:29:35,745
I really, l... l really apologize.

1301
01:29:38,707 --> 01:29:40,917
Thank you, Joanna.

1302
01:29:42,752 --> 01:29:45,797
Oh, gosh.

1303
01:29:45,881 --> 01:29:48,008
I just don't know what I'm gonna do.

1304
01:29:48,091 --> 01:29:51,720
I really don't. Will won't talk to me.

1305
01:29:51,803 --> 01:29:55,515
I have made such a mess of things.

1306
01:29:55,599 --> 01:30:00,103
I've really...
I can't live without him, Marni.

1307
01:30:01,313 --> 01:30:03,899
I think...

1308
01:30:03,982 --> 01:30:09,487
...everything is gonna
turn out just fine. Trust me.

1309
01:30:11,823 --> 01:30:14,075
You got this.

1310
01:30:20,457 --> 01:30:22,125
- Will?
- Go away.

1311
01:30:22,208 --> 01:30:23,668
- No, Will!
- Go away!

1312
01:30:23,752 --> 01:30:27,172
Wait! Would you just
wait for a second? Will!

1313
01:30:29,090 --> 01:30:30,634
- My leg!
- Are you OK? Which leg is it?

1314
01:30:30,717 --> 01:30:31,927
It's the same leg from the other day!

1315
01:30:32,010 --> 01:30:34,095
- It's my bad leg!
- Marni, guess what?

1316
01:30:34,179 --> 01:30:35,805
You hurt your left leg the other day,

1317
01:30:35,889 --> 01:30:37,557
- but really, good try, Marni.
- Wait, Will, hear me out.

1318
01:30:37,641 --> 01:30:39,184
Marni, I don't wanna hear you out!

1319
01:30:39,267 --> 01:30:40,769
I don't wanna hear anything
you have to say, OK?

1320
01:30:40,852 --> 01:30:43,313
You ruined what should have been
the best day of my life.

1321
01:30:43,396 --> 01:30:46,858
- Do you understand that?
- Yes, I do. And I'm really sorry.

1322
01:30:47,400 --> 01:30:49,694
I'm really, really sorry, Will.

1323
01:30:49,819 --> 01:30:52,530
Please try to accept my apology

1324
01:30:52,614 --> 01:30:57,619
because the last thing that I intended
was for you to get hurt.

1325
01:30:57,702 --> 01:31:02,499
You've just always protected me,
and I was trying to protect you...

1326
01:31:02,582 --> 01:31:07,045
...from the girl that
I thought Joanna was.

1327
01:31:08,129 --> 01:31:10,423
But she's not that girl anymore.

1328
01:31:11,341 --> 01:31:13,927
She's really not.

1329
01:31:14,010 --> 01:31:18,348
She's a girl who loves you
very, very much.

1330
01:31:20,016 --> 01:31:22,227
And you love her, too, dummy.

1331
01:31:24,479 --> 01:31:26,314
And that's all that matters.

1332
01:31:34,406 --> 01:31:36,241
I'm really sorry.

1333
01:31:47,919 --> 01:31:52,590
I guess we'll just have to wait it out,
'cause I told Will the truth.

1334
01:31:54,217 --> 01:31:56,845
- I don't know what else...
- No! Will and Joanna!

1335
01:31:56,928 --> 01:31:58,096
They're up in the tree house!

1336
01:31:58,179 --> 01:32:00,223
Why are you flipping out?
That's a good thing.

1337
01:32:00,306 --> 01:32:03,560
- They're probably hugging it out.
- No, I didn't want him

1338
01:32:03,643 --> 01:32:07,522
to give the tree house to her so
I was gonna take it apart and hide it!

1339
01:32:07,605 --> 01:32:10,025
Where did you suppose you were
gonna hide the tree house?

1340
01:32:10,108 --> 01:32:12,777
Look, the point is,
I loosened the bolts,

1341
01:32:12,902 --> 01:32:15,238
but didn't get a chance to finish.

1342
01:32:16,031 --> 01:32:17,157
That's not good.

1343
01:32:17,240 --> 01:32:20,535
Hey, guys! Can you
come down here for a second?

1344
01:32:20,618 --> 01:32:22,412
We have to talk to you!
It's important!

1345
01:32:22,495 --> 01:32:27,083
- Sure. How's it going, guys?
- Hi, guys!

1346
01:32:27,167 --> 01:32:28,710
- We're good!
- You know what,

1347
01:32:28,793 --> 01:32:30,962
this is kind of important, too, so we're
gonna be down in a minute, all right?

1348
01:32:31,046 --> 01:32:33,673
- Just give us one second.
- Yeah, we'll be down. Come on.

1349
01:32:34,257 --> 01:32:36,426
You're gonna be down
sooner than you think.

1350
01:32:45,101 --> 01:32:47,562
Well, darlings,
at least you're together.

1351
01:32:47,645 --> 01:32:50,190
- I'm so sorry, you guys.
- What are you sorry for, Marni?

1352
01:32:50,273 --> 01:32:52,484
Mom said it was probably termites,
and they've been meaning to get

1353
01:32:52,567 --> 01:32:53,902
that tree checked out anyways, you know?

1354
01:32:53,985 --> 01:32:56,821
Termites are the silent killers.

1355
01:32:58,239 --> 01:33:00,325
- Tammy!
- Hey, girl.

1356
01:33:00,408 --> 01:33:02,494
Hi, honey. So, what's the update?

1357
01:33:02,577 --> 01:33:04,913
Well, good news.
Your broken bones are gonna heal.

1358
01:33:04,996 --> 01:33:07,791
- That's good.
- The bad news:

1359
01:33:07,874 --> 01:33:09,709
we're gonna have to
postpone the wedding.

1360
01:33:09,793 --> 01:33:14,089
I'm sorry, nobody is
leaving this hospital today.

1361
01:33:14,172 --> 01:33:17,967
Except for all of you. OK,
everybody out. These two need some rest.

1362
01:33:18,051 --> 01:33:20,011
- Dad, that's ridiculous...
- Doctor's orders.

1363
01:33:20,095 --> 01:33:21,262
We're not tired, you guys.

1364
01:33:21,346 --> 01:33:23,348
- You do not have to leave.
- Everybody out.

1365
01:33:39,697 --> 01:33:41,032
Joanna?

1366
01:33:42,867 --> 01:33:46,371
Joanna? Joanna?

1367
01:33:47,038 --> 01:33:49,707
Wakey wakey, eggs and bakey.

1368
01:33:54,420 --> 01:33:58,216
My dress.
What's... What's going on?

1369
01:33:58,299 --> 01:33:59,551
Trust me.

1370
01:34:01,386 --> 01:34:02,971
Seriously, what is going on?

1371
01:34:03,054 --> 01:34:06,015
- Don't peek.
- I'm not, I'm not, I'm not.

1372
01:34:06,099 --> 01:34:08,059
- I'm serious.
- OK, but what's going on?

1373
01:34:08,184 --> 01:34:10,311
If I find out you peeked...

1374
01:34:10,395 --> 01:34:13,606
- Just, just... OK, all right.
- Are you...? OK.

1375
01:34:13,731 --> 01:34:16,734
- I can open? Can I open?
- Yes. Open.

1376
01:34:20,405 --> 01:34:23,825
I know it's not the fairy tale wedding
that you always planned in your head,

1377
01:34:23,908 --> 01:34:26,161
but, hopefully...

1378
01:34:28,371 --> 01:34:30,165
It's perfect.

1379
01:34:30,248 --> 01:34:32,417
- How do I look?
- You look beautiful.

1380
01:34:32,500 --> 01:34:34,252
Oh, wow...

1381
01:34:34,377 --> 01:34:36,379
<i>Well, you look magnifique, too.</i>

1382
01:34:36,462 --> 01:34:40,592
Which is good, because there's somebody
here who would like to see you.

1383
01:34:46,055 --> 01:34:48,057
Richie Phillips?

1384
01:34:49,517 --> 01:34:51,352
Wow.

1385
01:34:51,436 --> 01:34:55,440
Ramona, you haven't changed
a bit since high school.

1386
01:34:55,523 --> 01:34:59,110
Well, hopefully I've changed a little.

1387
01:35:01,279 --> 01:35:02,780
Welcome home.

1388
01:35:04,282 --> 01:35:05,283
Are you ready?

1389
01:35:07,827 --> 01:35:10,496
Marni, will you
walk me down the aisle?

1390
01:35:14,918 --> 01:35:16,920
I would be honored to.

1391
01:35:20,298 --> 01:35:22,258
I can't guarantee I won't trip.

1392
01:35:24,177 --> 01:35:25,553
OK.

1393
01:36:01,339 --> 01:36:04,425
Maybe one of these days
we'll be dancing at your wedding.

1394
01:36:04,509 --> 01:36:07,178
Oh, I don't know, Grandma. I...

1395
01:36:07,303 --> 01:36:09,681
I think I need to get a boyfriend first.

1396
01:36:09,806 --> 01:36:12,141
It seems to me you already have one.

1397
01:36:13,685 --> 01:36:16,187
Charlie? No,
Charlie's not my boyfriend.

1398
01:36:16,312 --> 01:36:18,189
Charlie thinks I'm a disaster.

1399
01:36:18,314 --> 01:36:22,735
Are you kidding? That boy
can't take his eyes off of you.

1400
01:36:22,819 --> 01:36:26,614
If you don't go for him, I will.

1401
01:36:26,698 --> 01:36:28,866
All right. Easy, tiger.

1402
01:36:33,913 --> 01:36:35,707
Oh, Joanna?

1403
01:36:35,790 --> 01:36:39,544
Mrs Sullivan, I'd like
to introduce you to Will's grandma.

1404
01:36:47,510 --> 01:36:50,263
- Helen?
- Bunny?

1405
01:36:52,390 --> 01:36:55,560
- You again?
- Wait, you two know each other?

1406
01:37:05,570 --> 01:37:07,697
Helen!

1407
01:37:09,741 --> 01:37:12,618
You look nice. Who dressed you,

1408
01:37:12,744 --> 01:37:17,081
- the Great Depression?
- You look lovely, Helen.

1409
01:37:17,206 --> 01:37:21,294
I'm so sorry I couldn't
attend your funeral last year.

1410
01:37:24,088 --> 01:37:26,174
Care to dance, miss?

1411
01:37:26,257 --> 01:37:29,218
Yes, I'd love to.

1412
01:37:31,137 --> 01:37:34,390
This ain't over, Bunny.

1413
01:37:35,600 --> 01:37:37,602
Don't get up in my grill, sister.

1414
01:37:46,277 --> 01:37:50,782
Ladies and gentlemen,
I am Marni Olsen, sister of the groom.

1415
01:37:50,907 --> 01:37:54,619
And now, sister of the bride.
And I struggled for a long time

1416
01:37:54,744 --> 01:37:58,956
with what to get the bride and groom.
And then it hit me.

1417
01:37:59,082 --> 01:38:03,628
Ladies and gentlemen,
Daryl Hall and John Oates.

1418
01:38:07,382 --> 01:38:08,800
That's our song!
