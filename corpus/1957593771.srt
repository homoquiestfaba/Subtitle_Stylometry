1
00:00:01,141 --> 00:00:03,891
(ethereal music)

2
00:00:13,862 --> 00:00:16,612
(majestic music)

3
00:00:30,738 --> 00:00:33,321
(upbeat music)

4
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:08,487
(contemplative music)

5
00:03:11,214 --> 00:03:14,881
(kids shouting in distance)

6
00:03:37,038 --> 00:03:40,205
(basketball thudding)

7
00:03:42,421 --> 00:03:43,304
(net rustling)

8
00:03:43,304 --> 00:03:45,479
- Nothing, but net.

9
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:46,930
- How'd you do that?
- Do what?

10
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:50,180
- Make that shot with your eyes closed?

11
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,912
(net rustling)

12
00:03:54,912 --> 00:03:57,829
I'd like to see you try that again.

13
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:07,730
(net rustling)
OK, eight apiece.

14
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:08,563
- [Desi] What?

15
00:04:08,563 --> 00:04:09,396
- Eight, eight.

16
00:04:09,396 --> 00:04:10,517
- Legget, why do you always do this.

17
00:04:10,517 --> 00:04:11,350
That was six.

18
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:12,183
- That was eight.

19
00:04:12,183 --> 00:04:13,016
- That was six.

20
00:04:13,016 --> 00:04:13,849
If you paid better attention

21
00:04:13,849 --> 00:04:15,250
maybe you'd get abetter grade in math.

22
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:17,290
- I got a C plus last quarter.

23
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:19,957
(both laughing)

24
00:04:21,567 --> 00:04:22,647
- Isn't this sweet.

25
00:04:22,647 --> 00:04:25,647
This is so sweet I'm getting
a cavity just standing here.

26
00:04:25,647 --> 00:04:26,698
- Hey, Tyler, what's up?

27
00:04:26,698 --> 00:04:28,358
- Sorry, Legs, I didn't mean
to interfere with anything

28
00:04:28,358 --> 00:04:30,608
between you and Pokey here.

29
00:04:32,285 --> 00:04:33,118
- Pokey?

30
00:04:33,118 --> 00:04:33,951
- What's the matter?

31
00:04:33,951 --> 00:04:35,667
Haven't you read the
latest issue of "Spycat?"

32
00:04:35,667 --> 00:04:36,525
- No.

33
00:04:36,525 --> 00:04:37,358
- Oh, it's great.

34
00:04:37,358 --> 00:04:40,447
Spycat makes friends with
this girl named Pokey.

35
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:43,164
She's just about to blossom into a woman.

36
00:04:43,164 --> 00:04:46,015
"Spycat" helps her with her training bra.

37
00:04:46,015 --> 00:04:48,682
(boys laughing)

38
00:04:50,116 --> 00:04:50,949
- Oh, no.

39
00:04:54,843 --> 00:04:56,926
- Forget about her, Legs.

40
00:05:00,306 --> 00:05:03,306
(bluesy jazz music)

41
00:05:27,826 --> 00:05:28,659
- Dad!

42
00:05:34,384 --> 00:05:35,989
Dad, how could you do this to me?

43
00:05:35,989 --> 00:05:37,035
- What did I do now?

44
00:05:37,035 --> 00:05:38,533
- Pokey, Pokey?

45
00:05:38,533 --> 00:05:40,927
I'm the laughing stock of
the entire eighth grade.

46
00:05:40,927 --> 00:05:44,246
Now everybody knows about you know.

47
00:05:44,246 --> 00:05:45,116
- Honey, about what?

48
00:05:45,116 --> 00:05:46,184
- Don't say it!

49
00:05:46,184 --> 00:05:47,842
Just don't even say it.

50
00:05:47,842 --> 00:05:50,592
(ethereal music)

51
00:05:52,033 --> 00:05:54,964
- Is there anyway I can help?

52
00:05:54,964 --> 00:05:57,918
- Desi, every girl goes
through this kind of a stage

53
00:05:57,918 --> 00:06:00,062
and I just thought Spycat could offer

54
00:06:00,062 --> 00:06:02,460
some helpful hints on the situation.

55
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:04,627
- Maybe we can find a way.

56
00:06:07,737 --> 00:06:09,278
- But why didn't you ask me?

57
00:06:09,278 --> 00:06:11,150
Now everybody's gonna call me Pokey.

58
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:12,732
Did you ever think about that?

59
00:06:12,732 --> 00:06:14,202
(phone rings)

60
00:06:14,202 --> 00:06:15,652
- I gotta get that.

61
00:06:15,652 --> 00:06:16,892
- Fine.

62
00:06:16,892 --> 00:06:18,071
- Desi!

63
00:06:18,071 --> 00:06:19,154
Oh, "Spycat."

64
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:22,493
What?

65
00:06:22,493 --> 00:06:23,699
Oh, hi, Peyton.

66
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:25,949
No, I haven't been jogging.

67
00:06:29,292 --> 00:06:31,622
No, it's just Desi.

68
00:06:31,622 --> 00:06:35,622
She's a little upset about
last week's "Spycat."

69
00:06:39,728 --> 00:06:40,719
Yeah, I know.

70
00:06:40,719 --> 00:06:42,130
It's a coming of age thing.

71
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:45,130
She's a little shy about developing.

72
00:06:46,558 --> 00:06:47,391
What?

73
00:06:48,788 --> 00:06:49,621
Really?

74
00:06:50,549 --> 00:06:51,860
Wait a minute.

75
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:53,749
You're kidding, me?

76
00:06:53,749 --> 00:06:55,979
Well, yeah, sure I'm
interested in meeting them.

77
00:06:55,979 --> 00:06:57,062
Tell me more.

78
00:06:59,349 --> 00:07:00,182
- [Tyler Voiceover] What's the matter?

79
00:07:00,182 --> 00:07:01,496
Haven't you read the
latest issue of "Spycat?"

80
00:07:01,496 --> 00:07:02,329
Oh, it's great.

81
00:07:02,329 --> 00:07:04,696
Spycat makes friends with
this girl named Pokey.

82
00:07:04,696 --> 00:07:07,234
She's a just about to
blossom into a woman.

83
00:07:07,234 --> 00:07:09,933
Spycat helps her with her training bra.

84
00:07:09,933 --> 00:07:12,502
(contemplative music)
(birds calling)

85
00:07:12,502 --> 00:07:14,422
- Well, no that's great.

86
00:07:14,422 --> 00:07:16,172
Well, tonight at six?

87
00:07:17,262 --> 00:07:18,954
Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure, sure.

88
00:07:18,954 --> 00:07:21,458
No, no, no, no six is fine.

89
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:23,864
Yeah, all right, I'll see you then.

90
00:07:23,864 --> 00:07:24,697
Bye bye.

91
00:07:30,733 --> 00:07:33,955
- [Desi Voiceover] Now
everybody knows about you know.

92
00:07:33,955 --> 00:07:34,788
- [Cameron Voiceover] Honey, about what?

93
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:35,743
- [Desi Voiceover] Don't say it!

94
00:07:35,743 --> 00:07:37,975
Just don't even say it.

95
00:07:37,975 --> 00:07:38,975
- 13 stinks.

96
00:07:40,691 --> 00:07:43,858
I don't see how 14 can be much better.

97
00:07:50,508 --> 00:07:51,410
(doorbell rings)

98
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:53,077
- Oh, no, not again.

99
00:07:54,201 --> 00:07:57,118
(doorbell chiming)

100
00:08:10,009 --> 00:08:10,842
- Oh, no.

101
00:08:12,631 --> 00:08:14,317
- I'll get it.

102
00:08:14,317 --> 00:08:16,867
Nobody moves, nobody gets hurt.

103
00:08:16,867 --> 00:08:19,017
Here we go again.

104
00:08:19,017 --> 00:08:20,034
- [Girl] Oh, and she was, like--

105
00:08:20,034 --> 00:08:21,687
- I know, they were fake, they're fake.

106
00:08:21,687 --> 00:08:22,645
Have you seen them?

107
00:08:22,645 --> 00:08:23,912
All over it.

108
00:08:23,912 --> 00:08:26,209
- Can you believe Rhonda
served hotdogs and hamburgers

109
00:08:26,209 --> 00:08:27,735
at her birthday party?

110
00:08:27,735 --> 00:08:29,705
- Like, hello, Earth to Rhonda.

111
00:08:29,705 --> 00:08:32,535
- No kidding, like I'm having
Cannelloni from Vito's.

112
00:08:32,535 --> 00:08:33,934
- Oh, really, is it fat free?

113
00:08:33,934 --> 00:08:36,063
- Please.
(clears throat)

114
00:08:36,063 --> 00:08:38,896
- The offer expires in 10 seconds.

115
00:08:39,755 --> 00:08:43,085
- Anyway, as I was saying
did you see her face?

116
00:08:43,085 --> 00:08:44,168
It was so--
- I know, it's like she--

117
00:08:44,168 --> 00:08:45,267
- Good afternoon, ladies.

118
00:08:45,267 --> 00:08:46,612
How was school?

119
00:08:46,612 --> 00:08:49,108
- [Girl] Hi Mr. Brooks.

120
00:08:49,108 --> 00:08:50,540
- Nice talking to you ladies.

121
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:53,049
- Oh my gosh, that is so gross.

122
00:08:53,049 --> 00:08:54,978
- Oh, no, I could never do that.

123
00:08:54,978 --> 00:08:57,157
I can't believe you actually saw her.

124
00:08:57,157 --> 00:08:58,115
That is so gross.

125
00:08:58,115 --> 00:09:00,764
But I told you, don't believe Alice.

126
00:09:00,764 --> 00:09:02,905
- I swear, I never know what
those two are talking about.

127
00:09:02,905 --> 00:09:05,430
They have a language all their own.

128
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:07,079
Like my father always said.

129
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:10,058
Children should be seen and not spoken to.

130
00:09:10,058 --> 00:09:11,919
Think about it.

131
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:14,095
- Miss Morningside, can I
speak to you for a moment?

132
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:15,230
- Yes, Mr. Brooks?

133
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:19,631
- Well, I guess you know
things have been, well,

134
00:09:19,631 --> 00:09:24,011
kind of rough around here
since my wife passed on,

135
00:09:24,011 --> 00:09:26,542
well, I'm not sure how to say this.

136
00:09:26,542 --> 00:09:28,297
You've been such a blessing for Desi,

137
00:09:28,297 --> 00:09:31,260
but I don't know if I can afford you--

138
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:33,238
- Mr. Brooks, don't worry about me.

139
00:09:33,238 --> 00:09:35,329
You can pay me when things work out.

140
00:09:35,329 --> 00:09:36,309
- Oh, Miss Morningside I--

141
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:39,308
- I've said my peace and
that's all I'm gonna say.

142
00:09:39,308 --> 00:09:41,598
There are some thing that are
more important than money,

143
00:09:41,598 --> 00:09:42,598
like family.

144
00:09:44,749 --> 00:09:47,238
Now, what do you want for lunch?

145
00:09:47,238 --> 00:09:50,091
I've got a very nice brisket.

146
00:09:50,091 --> 00:09:52,025
- With a glass of milk?

147
00:09:52,025 --> 00:09:54,489
- Glass of milk coming up.

148
00:09:54,489 --> 00:09:57,406
Oh, and one more thing, Mr. Brooks.

149
00:09:58,468 --> 00:10:00,288
My father always told me,

150
00:10:00,288 --> 00:10:04,135
it's always darkest right
after you turn out the light.

151
00:10:04,135 --> 00:10:05,385
Think about it.

152
00:10:10,906 --> 00:10:12,461
- What's this?

153
00:10:12,461 --> 00:10:13,756
- It's an Vera Wang dress.

154
00:10:13,756 --> 00:10:16,142
Don't you just love the sequins.

155
00:10:16,142 --> 00:10:18,692
Desi, it's an invitation
to a birthday party.

156
00:10:18,692 --> 00:10:19,525
- Birthday party?

157
00:10:19,525 --> 00:10:21,340
- Not just any birthday party.

158
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:22,533
It's my birthday party.

159
00:10:22,533 --> 00:10:26,150
- And I have exactly one week
to get this guy to notice me,

160
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:27,921
strike up a meaningful conversation,

161
00:10:27,921 --> 00:10:31,932
begin a relationship and
then, ask him to the party.

162
00:10:31,932 --> 00:10:34,075
I just don't have any margin for error

163
00:10:34,075 --> 00:10:35,240
so please.

164
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,281
- Geez, Pleasance, get a grip.

165
00:10:37,281 --> 00:10:39,590
It's just a birthday
party, not the playoffs.

166
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:41,412
- Just because you don't like boys--

167
00:10:41,412 --> 00:10:43,122
- Breathe, breathe.

168
00:10:43,122 --> 00:10:44,952
One, two, three.

169
00:10:44,952 --> 00:10:45,941
See what you've done.

170
00:10:45,941 --> 00:10:47,265
- You started it.

171
00:10:47,265 --> 00:10:49,864
Why do you have to have
a boy-girl party anyway?

172
00:10:49,864 --> 00:10:51,258
Why can't it just be us?

173
00:10:51,258 --> 00:10:53,288
- That was last year.

174
00:10:53,288 --> 00:10:55,220
Desi, darling, how can I say this to you

175
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:58,024
without hurting your little feelings?

176
00:10:58,024 --> 00:11:00,254
Our birthday's may only be two days apart,

177
00:11:00,254 --> 00:11:03,464
but in milestone's there is an
eon of difference between us.

178
00:11:03,464 --> 00:11:05,542
I've grown out of all that nonsense.

179
00:11:05,542 --> 00:11:06,875
- Nonsense, huh?

180
00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:09,945
- Desi, sweetie, it's a
time to put down your toys

181
00:11:09,945 --> 00:11:11,176
and become a woman.

182
00:11:11,176 --> 00:11:13,964
It's a time to stop dribbling and dance.

183
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:15,576
Boys don't go with girls
who compete with them

184
00:11:15,576 --> 00:11:17,051
at sweaty games.

185
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:18,694
- Gaynor, three weeks
ago you wouldn't go out

186
00:11:18,694 --> 00:11:20,593
for intramural swimming because
we have to share the pool

187
00:11:20,593 --> 00:11:21,569
with the boys team.

188
00:11:21,569 --> 00:11:22,853
- That's exactly my point.

189
00:11:22,853 --> 00:11:23,989
- What is?

190
00:11:23,989 --> 00:11:25,740
- You are so naive.

191
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:27,341
Do you really think boys
let you play basketball

192
00:11:27,341 --> 00:11:29,508
because you're good at it?

193
00:11:31,771 --> 00:11:35,281
There'll be a band, no jeans,
no sneakers, no baseball caps.

194
00:11:35,281 --> 00:11:37,551
And don't bring anything embarrassing.

195
00:11:37,551 --> 00:11:40,958
No pink shirts, no teddy
bears, no ghost stories,

196
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:43,053
oh, and just one more thing.

197
00:11:43,053 --> 00:11:44,541
You have to come with a boy.

198
00:11:44,541 --> 00:11:46,238
No boy, no party.

199
00:11:46,238 --> 00:11:47,071
Coming?

200
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:53,050
Pleasance, time to motivate.

201
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:54,457
Are we gonna the mall or not?

202
00:11:54,457 --> 00:11:55,457
- Of course.

203
00:11:57,697 --> 00:12:01,165
- Oh, yeah, and Desi, don't
forget to bring gifts.

204
00:12:01,165 --> 00:12:04,698
I mean it is a birthday party after all.

205
00:12:04,698 --> 00:12:05,737
Did you see Rhonda?

206
00:12:05,737 --> 00:12:08,404
- [Pleasance] I know, but Alice.

207
00:12:11,555 --> 00:12:14,828
- What have I gotten myself into now?

208
00:12:14,828 --> 00:12:15,929
- [Pleasance] Can you believe her?

209
00:12:15,929 --> 00:12:16,762
- I know, she wears this red cap,

210
00:12:16,762 --> 00:12:19,335
that was like so five years ago.

211
00:12:19,335 --> 00:12:21,093
- I know, that was,

212
00:12:21,093 --> 00:12:21,926
she's been wearing that
for years and years.

213
00:12:21,926 --> 00:12:24,611
- I know, she totally needs a change.

214
00:12:24,611 --> 00:12:26,118
- Oh, definitely, she is so--

215
00:12:26,118 --> 00:12:27,899
- We need to take her to the mall.

216
00:12:27,899 --> 00:12:29,109
- That would be so cool.

217
00:12:29,109 --> 00:12:30,908
- I know and let's get her a make over.

218
00:12:30,908 --> 00:12:32,584
- Oh, that would be great.

219
00:12:32,584 --> 00:12:36,020
- Oh, Miss Melanie,
it's very hard to be 14.

220
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:36,936
Remember?

221
00:12:36,936 --> 00:12:38,134
- Yes, I do.

222
00:12:38,134 --> 00:12:41,152
- And there's only so much
I can do from up here.

223
00:12:41,152 --> 00:12:43,812
- Maybe this is a good time
to ask Peter for a favor.

224
00:12:43,812 --> 00:12:46,712
You know he loved your hollyhocks.

225
00:12:46,712 --> 00:12:49,261
They were the most
beautiful we've ever seen.

226
00:12:49,261 --> 00:12:50,221
- Really?

227
00:12:50,221 --> 00:12:51,281
I can hardly believe it.

228
00:12:51,281 --> 00:12:52,821
They were my first you know.

229
00:12:52,821 --> 00:12:54,776
For so many years I've gone with roses.

230
00:12:54,776 --> 00:12:57,435
- Gabriel was truly delighted.

231
00:12:57,435 --> 00:12:59,852
And Peter was beside himself.

232
00:13:01,227 --> 00:13:03,600
And I think a tiny bit envious.

233
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,859
- So you think he might let me?

234
00:13:05,859 --> 00:13:07,113
- I can't promise anything.

235
00:13:07,113 --> 00:13:08,613
But you may have to share

236
00:13:08,613 --> 00:13:11,065
all your gardening secrets with him.

237
00:13:11,065 --> 00:13:12,715
- I sing to them.

238
00:13:12,715 --> 00:13:14,345
- Sing to them.

239
00:13:14,345 --> 00:13:17,801
- Lullabies.
(both giggling)

240
00:13:17,801 --> 00:13:20,355
- Oh, I cannot wait to
see the look on his face

241
00:13:20,355 --> 00:13:22,744
when I tell him that.

242
00:13:22,744 --> 00:13:24,270
I'll see what I can do.

243
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:26,687
- Oh, thank you Miss Melanie.

244
00:13:29,772 --> 00:13:31,532
Um, do you think there's anyway

245
00:13:31,532 --> 00:13:33,487
we could kind of hurry it up?

246
00:13:33,487 --> 00:13:34,320
- RJ.

247
00:13:37,122 --> 00:13:40,039
(Melanie laughing)

248
00:13:41,191 --> 00:13:44,935
- [Gaynor Voiceover] No
boy, no party, coming?

249
00:13:44,935 --> 00:13:46,018
- Pokey here.

250
00:13:52,271 --> 00:13:53,104
- [Gaynor Voiceover] Sweetie,

251
00:13:53,104 --> 00:13:57,354
it's time to put down your
toys and become a woman.

252
00:14:08,531 --> 00:14:11,114
(sultry music)

253
00:14:15,832 --> 00:14:19,082
(contemplative music)

254
00:14:24,371 --> 00:14:26,180
Do you really think boys let
you play basketball with them

255
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:28,347
because you're good at it?

256
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:32,447
(Legget laughs)

257
00:14:35,565 --> 00:14:36,970
- [Desi Voiceover] Why
can't it just be us?

258
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:41,470
- [Gaynor Voiceover] Just
because you don't like boys.

259
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:44,319
(doorbell rings)

260
00:14:44,319 --> 00:14:45,998
- Now what?

261
00:14:45,998 --> 00:14:47,748
- I got it, I got it.

262
00:14:52,436 --> 00:14:55,019
(sultry music)

263
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:57,347
Hello, Peyton.

264
00:14:58,291 --> 00:14:59,613
- Cameron.

265
00:14:59,613 --> 00:15:01,902
- Well, come in, come in.

266
00:15:01,902 --> 00:15:03,034
How are you?

267
00:15:03,034 --> 00:15:04,539
- I'm excellent.

268
00:15:04,539 --> 00:15:07,255
Oh, Cameron, it's so
good to see you again.

269
00:15:07,255 --> 00:15:08,921
- Well, likewise.

270
00:15:08,921 --> 00:15:10,671
Whew, you look great.

271
00:15:11,721 --> 00:15:13,108
- Don't I though?

272
00:15:13,108 --> 00:15:14,708
It's a brand-new dress.

273
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:15,541
Italian.

274
00:15:16,449 --> 00:15:17,782
- Uh, very nice.

275
00:15:20,193 --> 00:15:22,408
Here, let me show you
next week's "Spycat."

276
00:15:22,408 --> 00:15:23,303
- Oh, excellent.

277
00:15:23,303 --> 00:15:25,016
- Over here.

278
00:15:25,016 --> 00:15:25,849
- I'm honored.

279
00:15:25,849 --> 00:15:28,770
You know I absolutely
adored last week's strip.

280
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:31,709
You know the one about Pokey.

281
00:15:31,709 --> 00:15:32,542
- Really?

282
00:15:40,629 --> 00:15:43,997
- So, this is where the magic takes place.

283
00:15:43,997 --> 00:15:45,664
- Uh, yeah, I guess.

284
00:15:46,602 --> 00:15:48,748
- No, I'm serious.

285
00:15:48,748 --> 00:15:53,478
I really think your work strikes
a chord in today's youth.

286
00:15:53,478 --> 00:15:55,419
I really think with my help

287
00:15:55,419 --> 00:15:57,965
we can quadruplet its distribution.

288
00:15:57,965 --> 00:16:00,407
- Yeah, well, I've never been very good

289
00:16:00,407 --> 00:16:01,585
at presenting my work.

290
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:03,631
- Well you just leave that to me.

291
00:16:03,631 --> 00:16:05,244
That's what I'm here for.

292
00:16:05,244 --> 00:16:07,071
I'll wrap those distributors

293
00:16:07,071 --> 00:16:09,404
around my little finger over drinks,

294
00:16:09,404 --> 00:16:13,444
by dessert we'll be selling
"Spycat" in Venezuela.

295
00:16:13,444 --> 00:16:14,277
- Wow.

296
00:16:14,277 --> 00:16:16,454
I've always wanted to go to Caracas.

297
00:16:16,454 --> 00:16:20,605
- Oh, no dear, we're
eating Pierre's a tonight.

298
00:16:20,605 --> 00:16:22,513
- Right, Pierre's.

299
00:16:22,513 --> 00:16:23,346
Hey, listen.

300
00:16:23,346 --> 00:16:24,213
Make yourself comfortable.

301
00:16:24,213 --> 00:16:26,317
I want you to meet someone.

302
00:16:26,317 --> 00:16:27,400
- Hurry back.

303
00:16:31,606 --> 00:16:35,113
(knocking on door)

304
00:16:35,113 --> 00:16:36,530
- [Desi] Come in.

305
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:40,706
- Hey, Desi, I want you to come downstairs

306
00:16:40,706 --> 00:16:41,991
and meet somebody.

307
00:16:41,991 --> 00:16:43,009
- Who?
- My new agent.

308
00:16:43,009 --> 00:16:43,842
Her name's Peyton.

309
00:16:43,842 --> 00:16:45,307
Come on, I want you to meet her.

310
00:16:45,307 --> 00:16:48,137
- Looks like your new agent's
out of luck tonight, Dad.

311
00:16:48,137 --> 00:16:48,970
- What?

312
00:16:53,213 --> 00:16:54,713
- Mmm, how quaint.

313
00:16:57,338 --> 00:16:58,738
- Hey.

314
00:16:58,738 --> 00:17:00,607
Come on, Desi.

315
00:17:00,607 --> 00:17:01,456
Hey look.

316
00:17:01,456 --> 00:17:06,267
I'm sorry for not asking you
about your, uh, well, you know.

317
00:17:06,267 --> 00:17:08,599
But I really need you to come
down and meet my new agent.

318
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:10,501
She's got some great ideas about "Spycat."

319
00:17:10,501 --> 00:17:12,690
She thinks it's gonna be huge.

320
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:15,138
Hey, she thinks it's gonna be so huge

321
00:17:15,138 --> 00:17:18,721
that maybe we won't
have to sell the house.

322
00:17:21,629 --> 00:17:22,462
Come on.

323
00:17:25,106 --> 00:17:26,538
Gotcha!
( Desi laughing)

324
00:17:26,538 --> 00:17:27,788
Come on.
- Stop!

325
00:17:37,163 --> 00:17:38,996
- I should have known.

326
00:17:40,435 --> 00:17:41,913
- Thanks, Desi, I owe you one.

327
00:17:41,913 --> 00:17:42,746
- You owe me two.

328
00:17:42,746 --> 00:17:43,579
- One.
- Two.

329
00:17:43,579 --> 00:17:44,579
- One.
- Dad.

330
00:17:45,524 --> 00:17:46,357
- OK, two.

331
00:17:49,942 --> 00:17:53,252
Peyton, I want to
introduce you to someone.

332
00:17:53,252 --> 00:17:56,847
Peyton, this is my--
- What an adorable little boy.

333
00:17:56,847 --> 00:17:58,552
- No, Peyton, he is a she.

334
00:17:58,552 --> 00:17:59,385
- What?

335
00:17:59,385 --> 00:18:00,591
- This is Desi, my daughter.

336
00:18:00,591 --> 00:18:01,721
I told you about her on the phone.

337
00:18:01,721 --> 00:18:02,953
My little girl.

338
00:18:02,953 --> 00:18:04,709
- Oh my goodness.

339
00:18:04,709 --> 00:18:06,229
I'm so sorry.

340
00:18:06,229 --> 00:18:07,396
I had no idea.

341
00:18:09,177 --> 00:18:10,010
- Desi, hold on.

342
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:12,144
- Oh, Cameron, we really should go.

343
00:18:12,144 --> 00:18:12,977
- But, but I have to talk to--

344
00:18:12,977 --> 00:18:13,971
- No buts.

345
00:18:13,971 --> 00:18:15,421
Desi will be just fine.

346
00:18:15,421 --> 00:18:17,237
It's just a phase that we all go through.

347
00:18:17,237 --> 00:18:19,606
Even I went through it.

348
00:18:19,606 --> 00:18:20,856
- [Cameron] OK.

349
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:25,238
- I'm sorry if I hurt her feelings.

350
00:18:25,238 --> 00:18:29,227
But you have to admit
it was kind of funny.

351
00:18:29,227 --> 00:18:32,270
Anyway, I promise I
will make it up to her.

352
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:35,949
But right now we need to make you famous.

353
00:18:35,949 --> 00:18:37,335
Here.

354
00:18:37,335 --> 00:18:39,450
- Please tell me you're not buying this.

355
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:42,950
- All right, I guess you know what's best.

356
00:18:44,235 --> 00:18:46,582
- Now you're talking turkey.

357
00:18:46,582 --> 00:18:49,810
- It's a just been so hard since.

358
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:51,593
Well, since her mother passed away.

359
00:18:51,593 --> 00:18:54,262
Sometimes I have no idea
what's going on with her.

360
00:18:54,262 --> 00:18:55,953
- After tonight's meeting

361
00:18:55,953 --> 00:18:58,622
you will have the hottest
publication on the market

362
00:18:58,622 --> 00:19:03,052
and you'll be able to hire
the best child psychologist.

363
00:19:03,052 --> 00:19:04,252
- What?

364
00:19:04,252 --> 00:19:06,252
- Just kidding, darling.

365
00:19:08,593 --> 00:19:10,160
No, seriously, Cam.

366
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,422
If you ever need any
help with your daughter

367
00:19:12,422 --> 00:19:14,991
please don't be afraid to ask me.

368
00:19:14,991 --> 00:19:18,764
As your new partner,
that's what I'm here for.

369
00:19:18,764 --> 00:19:20,181
I'm here for you.

370
00:19:21,927 --> 00:19:24,337
- Well, thanks, Peyton.

371
00:19:24,337 --> 00:19:27,258
You know, I might just
take you up on that offer.

372
00:19:27,258 --> 00:19:28,973
- Excellent.

373
00:19:28,973 --> 00:19:31,556
Now, lets get down to business.

374
00:19:35,059 --> 00:19:38,398
Cameron, do you have bats in here?

375
00:19:38,398 --> 00:19:39,231
- Bats?

376
00:19:40,393 --> 00:19:41,351
- Never mind.

377
00:19:41,351 --> 00:19:42,184
Let's go.

378
00:19:43,469 --> 00:19:45,136
- Desi, I'm leaving.

379
00:19:49,331 --> 00:19:52,331
(melancholy music)

380
00:20:04,329 --> 00:20:06,912
(Desi sobbing)

381
00:20:10,892 --> 00:20:13,725
(papers rustling)

382
00:20:27,355 --> 00:20:30,105
(ethereal music)

383
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:34,617
- Peter wants me to tell you good luck.

384
00:20:34,617 --> 00:20:37,215
- Oh, Miss Melanie, thank you so much.

385
00:20:37,215 --> 00:20:39,003
- You're welcome RJ.

386
00:20:39,003 --> 00:20:40,306
But first we're gonna have to do something

387
00:20:40,306 --> 00:20:42,223
about the way you look.

388
00:20:43,844 --> 00:20:46,844
(magical twinkling)

389
00:20:50,722 --> 00:20:53,305
(gentle music)

390
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:29,637
(pensive music)

391
00:21:33,618 --> 00:21:36,201
(net rustling)

392
00:21:41,368 --> 00:21:43,645
(net rustling)

393
00:21:43,645 --> 00:21:45,285
- Three points, all net.

394
00:21:45,285 --> 00:21:46,868
How's that, Brooks?

395
00:21:48,037 --> 00:21:48,870
Hey, Desi.

396
00:21:54,765 --> 00:21:55,598
Nice shot.

397
00:21:55,598 --> 00:21:56,846
How about some one on one.

398
00:21:56,846 --> 00:21:57,679
What do you say?

399
00:21:57,679 --> 00:21:59,856
- I say, why don't you
go soak your head, Legs?

400
00:21:59,856 --> 00:22:01,106
- [Legget] Oh, come on.

401
00:22:01,106 --> 00:22:03,472
You're still not mad about yesterday.

402
00:22:03,472 --> 00:22:04,638
- Yesterday?

403
00:22:04,638 --> 00:22:07,019
What happened yesterday?

404
00:22:07,019 --> 00:22:08,390
- [Legget] OK, fine.

405
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:11,188
If you're afraid to play me, I understand.

406
00:22:11,188 --> 00:22:13,438
Sorry to bother you, Pokey.

407
00:22:15,291 --> 00:22:18,223
- Do you really think by calling that

408
00:22:18,223 --> 00:22:20,574
you're gonna bait me into
playing one on one with you?

409
00:22:20,574 --> 00:22:21,657
- Absolutely.

410
00:22:23,388 --> 00:22:24,221
- Winner's out.

411
00:22:24,221 --> 00:22:25,308
Got to win by two.

412
00:22:25,308 --> 00:22:27,017
- [Legget] Oh boy, you're going down hard.

413
00:22:27,017 --> 00:22:28,128
- You better pinch yourself.

414
00:22:28,128 --> 00:22:29,166
I think you're dreaming.

415
00:22:29,166 --> 00:22:29,999
- Ha, ha.

416
00:22:32,291 --> 00:22:33,612
Who's dreaming?

417
00:22:33,612 --> 00:22:34,612
It's my out.

418
00:22:49,225 --> 00:22:50,175
Who's dreaming?

419
00:22:50,175 --> 00:22:52,925
- [Desi] Throw me the ball, Legs.

420
00:22:56,243 --> 00:22:57,367
Who's going down?

421
00:22:57,367 --> 00:22:58,450
- Yeah, yeah.

422
00:23:03,062 --> 00:23:05,595
Come on, make your move.

423
00:23:05,595 --> 00:23:07,249
Ow!

424
00:23:07,249 --> 00:23:08,729
What the heck was that for, Brooks?

425
00:23:08,729 --> 00:23:11,362
- What did you think
you were doing, Legget?

426
00:23:11,362 --> 00:23:12,195
- Guarding.

427
00:23:12,195 --> 00:23:15,028
- Yeah, well, you better watch it.

428
00:23:16,402 --> 00:23:17,735
- What did I do?

429
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,516
(Desi sobbing)

430
00:23:25,516 --> 00:23:28,266
(ethereal music)

431
00:23:34,981 --> 00:23:36,731
- [RJ] Here, take it.

432
00:23:44,531 --> 00:23:45,454
- You don't really want me

433
00:23:45,454 --> 00:23:47,265
to blow my nose into this, do you?

434
00:23:47,265 --> 00:23:49,913
- Sure, it's what hankies were made for.

435
00:23:49,913 --> 00:23:52,746
It eases sneezes and clears tears.

436
00:23:55,294 --> 00:23:56,334
- You're the only person I ever met

437
00:23:56,334 --> 00:23:59,774
who really carried a handkerchief.

438
00:23:59,774 --> 00:24:01,191
Except my mother.

439
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:06,213
Here, I just couldn't.

440
00:24:08,507 --> 00:24:10,418
That's what sleeves are for.

441
00:24:10,418 --> 00:24:11,764
Thanks, anyway.

442
00:24:11,764 --> 00:24:14,083
- I was watching you guys play basketball.

443
00:24:14,083 --> 00:24:15,000
Nice elbow.

444
00:24:16,008 --> 00:24:18,645
I think you caught him a little off guard.

445
00:24:18,645 --> 00:24:19,478
- Oh, me too.

446
00:24:19,478 --> 00:24:21,262
I don't know what happened.

447
00:24:21,262 --> 00:24:22,547
One second I felt like crying

448
00:24:22,547 --> 00:24:26,538
and the next thing I knew my
elbow just flew into his eye.

449
00:24:26,538 --> 00:24:29,280
- I don't think he does either.

450
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:32,307
- Lately my head will say one
thing and my body will ends up

451
00:24:32,307 --> 00:24:34,726
doing something completely different.

452
00:24:34,726 --> 00:24:36,366
- It's an emotional response.

453
00:24:36,366 --> 00:24:40,708
Often triggered by sugar,
anger, or good looking boys.

454
00:24:40,708 --> 00:24:42,335
- Legget?

455
00:24:42,335 --> 00:24:43,965
Good looking?

456
00:24:43,965 --> 00:24:46,906
- I thought he was kind of cute.

457
00:24:46,906 --> 00:24:49,295
- Maybe, I never really
thought about it before.

458
00:24:49,295 --> 00:24:50,767
- Uh-huh.

459
00:24:50,767 --> 00:24:53,197
- OK, maybe a little bit.

460
00:24:53,197 --> 00:24:54,530
For a blockhead.

461
00:24:55,975 --> 00:24:57,078
Do you go to Memorial High?

462
00:24:57,078 --> 00:24:58,638
I don't remember seeing you around.

463
00:24:58,638 --> 00:25:00,984
- No, I'm kind of new here.

464
00:25:00,984 --> 00:25:02,919
Well, sort of.

465
00:25:02,919 --> 00:25:04,810
I used to live here.

466
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:07,975
- Oh, well things don't
change much around here.

467
00:25:07,975 --> 00:25:10,857
- Oh, things rarely change.

468
00:25:10,857 --> 00:25:11,690
But we do.

469
00:25:12,617 --> 00:25:14,599
- Yeah, I know.

470
00:25:14,599 --> 00:25:15,432
- I'm RJ.

471
00:25:16,268 --> 00:25:17,529
- Destiny.

472
00:25:17,529 --> 00:25:19,761
- Nice to know you, Desi.

473
00:25:19,761 --> 00:25:21,145
- Well, I got to go.

474
00:25:21,145 --> 00:25:21,978
Thanks.

475
00:25:24,945 --> 00:25:28,778
Hey, how did you know
everybody calls me Desi?

476
00:25:37,516 --> 00:25:42,035
(ethereal music)
(vocalizing)

477
00:25:42,035 --> 00:25:45,035
(doorbell chiming)

478
00:25:58,774 --> 00:25:59,985
- Yes?

479
00:25:59,985 --> 00:26:01,235
- Oh, hi there.

480
00:26:02,206 --> 00:26:03,872
Cam?
- Excuse me.

481
00:26:03,872 --> 00:26:04,705
- Cameron.

482
00:26:04,705 --> 00:26:05,575
- Lady you better start explaining.

483
00:26:05,575 --> 00:26:08,304
You can't just walk in here--
- I know you're in there.

484
00:26:08,304 --> 00:26:09,683
They went for it.

485
00:26:09,683 --> 00:26:13,063
Spycat's going to be
syndicated nationwide.

486
00:26:13,063 --> 00:26:15,102
- Syndication, Peyton, you're amazing!

487
00:26:15,102 --> 00:26:17,931
- Oh, I agree, I agree, I agree!

488
00:26:17,931 --> 00:26:19,590
- Oh, excuse me, Peyton.

489
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:20,891
This is Miss Morningside.

490
00:26:20,891 --> 00:26:22,742
- Oh, we met, Cam.

491
00:26:22,742 --> 00:26:23,575
- Charming.

492
00:26:23,575 --> 00:26:26,898
- They want to start
with next week's strip.

493
00:26:26,898 --> 00:26:27,965
- Next week's strip?

494
00:26:27,965 --> 00:26:29,279
Well, that's no problem,
it's almost finished.

495
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:30,690
- Oh, excellent.

496
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:33,450
And I can't wait to tell
you about the changes.

497
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:34,771
- Changes?

498
00:26:34,771 --> 00:26:37,839
- Oh, minor, small, tiny,
subtle shadings, you know?

499
00:26:37,839 --> 00:26:40,580
- Well, Peyton, I don't
know about changes.

500
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:42,210
- Shh.

501
00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:44,127
Nothing to worry about.

502
00:26:47,759 --> 00:26:48,592
- Dad.

503
00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:50,650
- Desi.

504
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:53,400
- Desi, what an interesting look.

505
00:26:54,679 --> 00:26:55,867
- What happened to you?

506
00:26:55,867 --> 00:26:58,158
- Nothing, I was shooting baskets.

507
00:26:58,158 --> 00:27:01,258
I got into a little scuffle
with Legget, that's all.

508
00:27:01,258 --> 00:27:02,882
- What, what do you mean scuffle?

509
00:27:02,882 --> 00:27:05,043
- I elbowed him in the eye.

510
00:27:05,043 --> 00:27:07,961
- Darling, that only
works in kindergarten.

511
00:27:07,961 --> 00:27:09,611
If you want a boy's attention--

512
00:27:09,611 --> 00:27:11,550
- I didn't want his attention.

513
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:13,400
I wanted to beat him.

514
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,040
- Desi, I don't want
you fighting with boys.

515
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:17,128
- It was an accident, Dad.

516
00:27:17,128 --> 00:27:18,768
- Yeah, well, we'll talk about that later.

517
00:27:18,768 --> 00:27:20,977
Peyton and I have some
business to discuss.

518
00:27:20,977 --> 00:27:22,325
Now she's gonna be joining us for dinner

519
00:27:22,325 --> 00:27:23,596
so why don't you go upstairs,

520
00:27:23,596 --> 00:27:25,414
get cleaned up and look presentable.

521
00:27:25,414 --> 00:27:26,926
- Oh, joy.

522
00:27:26,926 --> 00:27:29,356
- Oh, I know you must
look perfectly adorable

523
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:30,836
when you want to.

524
00:27:30,836 --> 00:27:32,801
- Yeah, adorable.

525
00:27:32,801 --> 00:27:36,034
I'll see if I can find something pink.

526
00:27:36,034 --> 00:27:38,148
Better yet, mesh.

527
00:27:38,148 --> 00:27:38,981
- Desi.

528
00:27:40,076 --> 00:27:43,407
Oh, I don't know, she's at that age.

529
00:27:43,407 --> 00:27:44,908
Whatever that means.

530
00:27:44,908 --> 00:27:48,687
- Maybe, I should have a talk with her.

531
00:27:48,687 --> 00:27:50,825
You know, girl talk.

532
00:27:50,825 --> 00:27:52,235
Maybe take her shopping.

533
00:27:52,235 --> 00:27:55,032
- Oh, well, Peyton, I
couldn't ask you to do that.

534
00:27:55,032 --> 00:27:56,865
- Oh, no, I'd love to.

535
00:27:58,013 --> 00:27:58,846
Really.

536
00:28:00,144 --> 00:28:03,144
- Oh, well, now that you mention it.

537
00:28:04,278 --> 00:28:07,732
Maybe a female influence would be helpful.

538
00:28:07,732 --> 00:28:09,244
- Great then.

539
00:28:09,244 --> 00:28:11,986
Now, I'll go talk to Miss
Morningbreath about tonight's--

540
00:28:11,986 --> 00:28:13,883
- Morningside, Miss Morningside.

541
00:28:13,883 --> 00:28:16,521
- Right, right, Morningside.

542
00:28:16,521 --> 00:28:18,721
I'll go talk to her about tonight's menu.

543
00:28:18,721 --> 00:28:20,523
- Wait Peyton, I wanted to talk
to you about those changes.

544
00:28:20,523 --> 00:28:21,848
- Oh, tomorrow, darling.

545
00:28:21,848 --> 00:28:23,360
Tomorrow, I promise.

546
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:26,443
(Cameron stammering)

547
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:30,446
(contemplative music)

548
00:28:31,651 --> 00:28:33,279
- Get used to it, honey.

549
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:35,679
Eventually it'll be an asset.

550
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:38,799
- Oh, Morningside, what am I gonna do.

551
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:41,119
Everything is so strange.

552
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:43,068
My friends are acting weird.

553
00:28:43,068 --> 00:28:45,818
Legget looks at me like
I'm from another planet.

554
00:28:45,818 --> 00:28:47,000
And I feel different.

555
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,311
- That's because you are different.

556
00:28:49,311 --> 00:28:50,631
You're growing up.

557
00:28:50,631 --> 00:28:52,209
- I don't Want to grow up.

558
00:28:52,209 --> 00:28:54,464
- Oh, you will, dear.

559
00:28:54,464 --> 00:28:56,714
Look how beautiful you are.

560
00:28:57,596 --> 00:29:00,195
- How come I don't feel
so beautiful right now?

561
00:29:00,195 --> 00:29:03,112
- Don't worry, you will, I promise.

562
00:29:04,718 --> 00:29:06,998
- What do I do in the meantime?

563
00:29:06,998 --> 00:29:07,831
- Destiny.

564
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:14,706
If you wanna see a rainbow,
you gotta put up with the rain.

565
00:29:28,409 --> 00:29:30,992
(sultry music)

566
00:30:00,991 --> 00:30:03,399
Can I help you with something?

567
00:30:03,399 --> 00:30:06,399
- Yes, are those free-range chickens?

568
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:09,740
- Nope, they go for about $4 a pound.

569
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:12,809
- Right, it's a good thing
I caught you in time.

570
00:30:12,809 --> 00:30:14,488
- In time for what?

571
00:30:14,488 --> 00:30:16,391
- The menu for tonight's dinner.

572
00:30:16,391 --> 00:30:17,706
I've offered to handle things

573
00:30:17,706 --> 00:30:20,697
while Mr. Brooks is working
on some last minute changes.

574
00:30:20,697 --> 00:30:22,107
- I have dinner planned.

575
00:30:22,107 --> 00:30:24,690
- Oh, I'm sorry Miss, whatever.

576
00:30:26,118 --> 00:30:29,118
But we're gonna have to cancel that.

577
00:30:32,708 --> 00:30:34,336
- There's a 13 year old girl in this house

578
00:30:34,336 --> 00:30:36,706
that's gonna turn up
her nose at this stuff.

579
00:30:36,706 --> 00:30:38,306
Radicchio?

580
00:30:38,306 --> 00:30:40,258
- Well, I think it's just about time

581
00:30:40,258 --> 00:30:43,206
that Desi started behaving like an adult.

582
00:30:43,206 --> 00:30:47,305
She cannot be adorable little
Desi there rest of her life.

583
00:30:47,305 --> 00:30:51,413
And part of being an adult
is eating adult foods.

584
00:30:51,413 --> 00:30:52,823
See the connection?

585
00:30:52,823 --> 00:30:56,331
- Well, maybe I'm blind, because
I don't see any connection

586
00:30:56,331 --> 00:30:59,539
between Radicchio and a 13 year old girl.

587
00:30:59,539 --> 00:31:01,308
- I'm sorry.

588
00:31:01,308 --> 00:31:05,808
Besides, everything on
that menu is 99% fat free.

589
00:31:06,687 --> 00:31:08,576
- Sounds delicious.

590
00:31:08,576 --> 00:31:10,909
- Dinner, promptly at eight.

591
00:31:14,087 --> 00:31:18,174
- Connection, I'll show
you connection, blondie.

592
00:31:18,174 --> 00:31:21,091
(cleaver pounding)

593
00:31:23,248 --> 00:31:25,081
- Hey, Des, come here.

594
00:31:26,078 --> 00:31:28,726
You know, I realize it's been a long time

595
00:31:28,726 --> 00:31:31,904
since you've gone out
and bought anything new.

596
00:31:31,904 --> 00:31:32,874
Your birthday's coming up

597
00:31:32,874 --> 00:31:34,248
and Gaynor's party's in a few days.

598
00:31:34,248 --> 00:31:36,605
- How do you know about Gaynor's party?

599
00:31:36,605 --> 00:31:39,765
- Oh, I, uh, found the
invitation on the staircase.

600
00:31:39,765 --> 00:31:41,634
It says you have to bring a boy?

601
00:31:41,634 --> 00:31:44,328
Well, anyway, Peyton wants
to take you out shopping

602
00:31:44,328 --> 00:31:45,420
as your birthday present.

603
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:47,350
She wants you to look nice for your party.

604
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:48,569
- How's Saturday?

605
00:31:48,569 --> 00:31:49,788
- Well, great.

606
00:31:49,788 --> 00:31:52,641
Hey look, take my credit
card, buy something pretty.

607
00:31:52,641 --> 00:31:54,779
And have a great time.

608
00:31:54,779 --> 00:31:55,612
OK?

609
00:31:57,809 --> 00:31:58,726
- Shopping?

610
00:32:00,129 --> 00:32:01,879
Buy something pretty?

611
00:32:03,909 --> 00:32:05,478
(Desi sighing)

612
00:32:05,478 --> 00:32:06,470
- Jake?

613
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:07,430
Mabel.

614
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:11,089
Listen, what in tarnation
is a free-range chicken?

615
00:32:11,089 --> 00:32:14,398
And why in the Sam Hill
are they so expensive?

616
00:32:14,398 --> 00:32:15,898
Yeah, yeah, right.

617
00:32:18,189 --> 00:32:20,361
You mean to tell me they roam around free

618
00:32:20,361 --> 00:32:21,690
and eat what they can find

619
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:25,298
and I have to pay more for
their bohemian lifestyle?

620
00:32:25,298 --> 00:32:26,131
I don't know, Jake.

621
00:32:26,131 --> 00:32:27,525
Sounds like a bum deal to me.

622
00:32:27,525 --> 00:32:31,095
Yeah, Jake, listen, do me a favor.

623
00:32:31,095 --> 00:32:32,959
Take two regular stupid chickens

624
00:32:32,959 --> 00:32:36,329
and wrap them up in a free-range
package and send them over.

625
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:39,321
Yeah, Jake, like my father always said,

626
00:32:39,321 --> 00:32:43,176
a chicken without feathers is still bald.

627
00:32:43,176 --> 00:32:44,426
Think about it.

628
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:52,430
- OK, there's this girl in my class.

629
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:55,422
She thinks she's all a valley
girl, I think she really is.

630
00:32:55,422 --> 00:32:56,981
But she.

631
00:32:56,981 --> 00:32:58,347
- She thinks she is?

632
00:32:58,347 --> 00:32:59,180
Oh my god.

633
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:01,461
- She's all, she said, I
don't accept that serve to me

634
00:33:01,461 --> 00:33:03,341
when I was playing handball with her.

635
00:33:03,341 --> 00:33:04,650
- Playing handball?

636
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:07,170
(talking over each other)

637
00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:08,978
- [Girl] Valley girl
doing playing handball.

638
00:33:08,978 --> 00:33:11,084
- I know, she goes, she goes.
- She's such a wannabe.

639
00:33:11,084 --> 00:33:12,715
- She goes, "I don't accept that serve."

640
00:33:12,715 --> 00:33:15,247
And I go "I don't care,
get off the court."

641
00:33:15,247 --> 00:33:18,286
- You should go, I don't accept you.

642
00:33:18,286 --> 00:33:20,119
Go I don't accept you.

643
00:33:21,908 --> 00:33:24,825
(melancholy music)

644
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:34,013
- Desi?

645
00:33:35,647 --> 00:33:37,356
Is everything OK?

646
00:33:37,356 --> 00:33:38,888
- Yeah, Dad.

647
00:33:38,888 --> 00:33:40,555
Everything's peachy.

648
00:33:46,368 --> 00:33:49,201
- Well, if there was ever anything

649
00:33:51,513 --> 00:33:53,636
that you wanna talk about.

650
00:33:53,636 --> 00:33:54,969
- I'm fine, Dad.

651
00:33:58,585 --> 00:34:03,002
- Yeah, hey, you know if
you'd feel more comfortable,

652
00:34:05,204 --> 00:34:06,703
maybe you could talk to Peyton.

653
00:34:06,703 --> 00:34:07,536
- Pass.

654
00:34:09,414 --> 00:34:11,581
Just forget about it, Dad.

655
00:34:13,784 --> 00:34:15,885
- You know, Desi, she's a very nice lady.

656
00:34:15,885 --> 00:34:18,552
I wish you two could be friends.

657
00:34:22,504 --> 00:34:23,504
- Why?
- Why?

658
00:34:24,555 --> 00:34:26,404
Because we work together.

659
00:34:26,404 --> 00:34:27,573
She's gonna be spending a lot of time

660
00:34:27,573 --> 00:34:29,805
working with me on "Spycat."

661
00:34:29,805 --> 00:34:30,853
Look, Desi.

662
00:34:30,853 --> 00:34:32,728
With her help everything is gonna change.

663
00:34:32,728 --> 00:34:35,693
We won't have to move out of this house.

664
00:34:35,693 --> 00:34:39,213
It would be easier, more comfortable

665
00:34:39,213 --> 00:34:42,365
if you two could just get along.

666
00:34:42,365 --> 00:34:44,152
- Do you like her?

667
00:34:44,152 --> 00:34:46,333
- Yes, of course.

668
00:34:46,333 --> 00:34:49,451
- Do you think she's pretty.

669
00:34:49,451 --> 00:34:52,701
- I, uh, I think she's very attractive.

670
00:34:55,195 --> 00:34:57,283
- She's staying for dinner again?

671
00:34:57,283 --> 00:34:59,395
- Possibly, if we work late.

672
00:34:59,395 --> 00:35:00,895
Is that a problem?

673
00:35:01,865 --> 00:35:04,448
- If that's what you want, Dad.

674
00:35:48,778 --> 00:35:52,361
Why couldn't we just
stay that way forever?

675
00:37:40,716 --> 00:37:42,133
- May I help you?

676
00:37:43,967 --> 00:37:45,525
- I'm just looking.

677
00:37:45,525 --> 00:37:49,127
- Perhaps if I knew what
you were looking for.

678
00:37:49,127 --> 00:37:51,044
- I'm not exactly sure.

679
00:37:52,967 --> 00:37:55,505
- I believe you'd be more comfortable

680
00:37:55,505 --> 00:37:58,255
with the athletic store upstairs.

681
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,150
- Maybe you're right.

682
00:38:03,381 --> 00:38:06,464
(gentle piano music)

683
00:38:37,459 --> 00:38:39,768
- I like this one.

684
00:38:39,768 --> 00:38:41,851
The diamond is exquisite.

685
00:38:42,694 --> 00:38:44,378
- It looks good on you.

686
00:38:44,378 --> 00:38:46,668
But then again, anything does.

687
00:38:46,668 --> 00:38:50,251
- Oh, Derrick, you say
the sweetest things.

688
00:38:51,122 --> 00:38:53,986
- Do you really think this
chump's gonna buy you this ring?

689
00:38:53,986 --> 00:38:56,007
- I've got him wrapped around my finger.

690
00:38:56,007 --> 00:38:57,257
Just like this.

691
00:39:03,122 --> 00:39:05,958
- How much longer is this gonna take?

692
00:39:05,958 --> 00:39:07,918
- Soon we're going to be rich.

693
00:39:07,918 --> 00:39:09,676
Just as soon as I can convince Cameron

694
00:39:09,676 --> 00:39:11,926
to change his insipid little cartoon

695
00:39:11,926 --> 00:39:14,874
we will be rolling in dough.

696
00:39:14,874 --> 00:39:17,675
I figure he'll ask me to
marry him within six months.

697
00:39:17,675 --> 00:39:19,066
I'll divorce him within eight

698
00:39:19,066 --> 00:39:22,315
and start collecting
alimony in Tahiti by nine.

699
00:39:22,315 --> 00:39:23,351
(Peyton laughing)

700
00:39:23,351 --> 00:39:24,934
- I love your mind.

701
00:39:26,075 --> 00:39:27,545
- Now, if I can just figure out a way

702
00:39:27,545 --> 00:39:30,628
to get rid of that bratty little kid.

703
00:39:36,875 --> 00:39:37,972
- [Derrick] Come here.

704
00:39:37,972 --> 00:39:41,222
(contemplative music)

705
00:39:46,373 --> 00:39:49,123
(ethereal music)

706
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:52,204
- [RJ] Hi, Desi.

707
00:39:52,204 --> 00:39:53,037
- Hi.

708
00:39:53,037 --> 00:39:54,485
- I didn't see you at the park today.

709
00:39:54,485 --> 00:39:57,914
- No, didn't feel much like basketball.

710
00:39:57,914 --> 00:39:59,711
- I saw Legget at the basketball court.

711
00:39:59,711 --> 00:40:02,133
He's got quite a shiner.

712
00:40:02,133 --> 00:40:05,047
- I guess I should feel kind
of guilty about that, but.

713
00:40:05,047 --> 00:40:06,304
- But you don't?

714
00:40:06,304 --> 00:40:08,662
- I don't know what I feel.

715
00:40:08,662 --> 00:40:10,472
I want to apologize,
but whenever I see him

716
00:40:10,472 --> 00:40:12,238
I just feel like smacking him.

717
00:40:12,238 --> 00:40:15,114
- I think boys have that same
effect on girls your age.

718
00:40:15,114 --> 00:40:17,423
I know, I felt the same way.

719
00:40:17,423 --> 00:40:18,963
- How old are you?

720
00:40:18,963 --> 00:40:20,693
- What would you guess?

721
00:40:20,693 --> 00:40:21,610
- 16 or 17.

722
00:40:23,883 --> 00:40:24,966
- Good guess.

723
00:40:26,242 --> 00:40:28,355
- You're so pretty I don't see why boys

724
00:40:28,355 --> 00:40:30,945
wouldn't automatically like you.

725
00:40:30,945 --> 00:40:33,694
- What makes you think
boys don't like you?

726
00:40:33,694 --> 00:40:35,343
- Look at me.

727
00:40:35,343 --> 00:40:37,454
- You should have seen me at your age.

728
00:40:37,454 --> 00:40:41,258
I was taller than all the
other girls, all arms and legs.

729
00:40:41,258 --> 00:40:43,615
All I had to do was look at French fries

730
00:40:43,615 --> 00:40:46,031
and my skin would break out.

731
00:40:46,031 --> 00:40:47,262
My hair was frizzy when it rained

732
00:40:47,262 --> 00:40:49,504
and like a dishrag when it was hot.

733
00:40:49,504 --> 00:40:52,619
I was clumsy, self-conscious,
nothing fit right.

734
00:40:52,619 --> 00:40:54,614
And what's more, I was sure
boys were staring at me

735
00:40:54,614 --> 00:40:57,391
for all the wrong reasons.

736
00:40:57,391 --> 00:41:01,782
- But, it seems so easy
for Gaynor and Pleasance.

737
00:41:01,782 --> 00:41:03,198
We used to be best friends,

738
00:41:03,198 --> 00:41:05,154
but now all they like are clothes

739
00:41:05,154 --> 00:41:07,122
and hanging out at the mall.

740
00:41:07,122 --> 00:41:09,789
All they ever talk about are boys.

741
00:41:09,789 --> 00:41:13,950
- Everyone has to come into
their own in their own time.

742
00:41:13,950 --> 00:41:16,057
It's just their turn now.

743
00:41:16,057 --> 00:41:17,220
Look.

744
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:22,138
Everyone has a perfect age
when everything changes.

745
00:41:22,138 --> 00:41:23,231
You wake up one morning,

746
00:41:23,231 --> 00:41:26,258
you look in the mirror
and you see the best you.

747
00:41:26,258 --> 00:41:30,019
When everything has caught
up with everything else.

748
00:41:30,019 --> 00:41:32,274
- I just can't believe that
I could ever be anything

749
00:41:32,274 --> 00:41:34,631
like you and I just can't ever imagine

750
00:41:34,631 --> 00:41:37,642
ever wanting to hang out at the mall.

751
00:41:37,642 --> 00:41:39,801
- You don't have to like those things.

752
00:41:39,801 --> 00:41:41,650
And you don't have to give
up the things you love.

753
00:41:41,650 --> 00:41:44,792
Play basketball 'til you're a
hundred if it makes you happy.

754
00:41:44,792 --> 00:41:46,603
- But it's a hard to imagine any boy

755
00:41:46,603 --> 00:41:49,781
wanting to spend time with a point guard.

756
00:41:49,781 --> 00:41:52,079
- If you're honest about who you are

757
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:54,431
people will start to see you as special.

758
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:55,764
Especially boys.

759
00:41:58,239 --> 00:42:00,879
- My mother was very beautiful.

760
00:42:00,879 --> 00:42:05,212
She always loved being
outdoors and riding bicycles.

761
00:42:07,323 --> 00:42:08,598
Oh no.

762
00:42:08,598 --> 00:42:09,705
- What?

763
00:42:09,705 --> 00:42:11,177
- Peyton.

764
00:42:11,177 --> 00:42:12,808
My father's agent.

765
00:42:12,808 --> 00:42:13,876
- You don't like her?

766
00:42:13,876 --> 00:42:15,436
- What's to like.

767
00:42:15,436 --> 00:42:18,177
I keep wanting to scratch
off that plastic layer

768
00:42:18,177 --> 00:42:19,453
to see what's underneath

769
00:42:19,453 --> 00:42:22,088
but I'm afraid some gooey green monster

770
00:42:22,088 --> 00:42:24,459
wearing bright pink
lipstick is gonna ooze out

771
00:42:24,459 --> 00:42:27,498
all over the ground and ruin the lawn.

772
00:42:27,498 --> 00:42:29,819
I think my father likes her.

773
00:42:29,819 --> 00:42:30,652
I don't trust her.

774
00:42:30,652 --> 00:42:32,456
I think she's up to something.

775
00:42:32,456 --> 00:42:33,289
- Really?

776
00:42:35,868 --> 00:42:38,868
(car alarm wailing)

777
00:42:46,353 --> 00:42:47,194
(Peyton screams)

778
00:42:47,194 --> 00:42:49,944
(girls laughing)

779
00:42:52,203 --> 00:42:53,574
- Would you stay for dinner?

780
00:42:53,574 --> 00:42:54,407
- Oh, I don't know.

781
00:42:54,407 --> 00:42:55,240
- Please.

782
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:56,760
Come on, I always feel outnumbered.

783
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:58,290
At least there'd be someone to talk to

784
00:42:58,290 --> 00:42:59,968
instead of watching my father and Peyton

785
00:42:59,968 --> 00:43:02,635
make goo-goo eyes at each other.

786
00:43:09,639 --> 00:43:10,472
- I'd love to.

787
00:43:10,472 --> 00:43:11,861
- Great, let's go around back.

788
00:43:11,861 --> 00:43:13,059
I'll show you my room.

789
00:43:13,059 --> 00:43:14,761
- Now, this is what I came with.

790
00:43:14,761 --> 00:43:16,929
This new character, per
your suggestions of course,

791
00:43:16,929 --> 00:43:20,029
which were very imaginative.

792
00:43:20,029 --> 00:43:22,380
Now, it's a just
preliminary you understand.

793
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:23,543
- They're fabulous.

794
00:43:23,543 --> 00:43:25,922
Exactly what I had in mind.

795
00:43:25,922 --> 00:43:27,866
Oh, I just love Dumb Dog.

796
00:43:27,866 --> 00:43:30,285
- Yeah, well I guess I
kinda warmed up to the idea.

797
00:43:30,285 --> 00:43:33,226
- I still think there's something missing.

798
00:43:33,226 --> 00:43:34,059
- Missing?

799
00:43:34,059 --> 00:43:34,995
I thought the addition of Dumb Dog was--

800
00:43:34,995 --> 00:43:36,955
- I still think it needs something bold.

801
00:43:36,955 --> 00:43:38,624
Something powerful.

802
00:43:38,624 --> 00:43:40,874
Something je ne sais quois.

803
00:43:42,073 --> 00:43:43,255
I've got it.
- What?

804
00:43:43,255 --> 00:43:46,164
- Why don't you have
a panel showing Spycat

805
00:43:46,164 --> 00:43:50,475
pushing Dumb Dog into a
gigantic cheese grater?

806
00:43:50,475 --> 00:43:51,972
- A cheese grater?

807
00:43:51,972 --> 00:43:54,473
- The distributors are gonna love it.

808
00:43:54,473 --> 00:43:58,071
The eternal struggle
between cats and dogs.

809
00:43:58,071 --> 00:44:01,272
Think about the conflict,
think about the triumph.

810
00:44:01,272 --> 00:44:03,105
Think about the sales.

811
00:44:05,554 --> 00:44:08,263
You're on the edge of greatness.

812
00:44:08,263 --> 00:44:10,452
Children will be reading "Spycat"

813
00:44:10,452 --> 00:44:12,869
from Los Angeles to New York.

814
00:44:13,812 --> 00:44:16,234
We make a great team, Cameron.

815
00:44:16,234 --> 00:44:17,234
- You think?

816
00:44:18,133 --> 00:44:18,966
- I know.

817
00:44:20,673 --> 00:44:23,812
(clears throat)

818
00:44:23,812 --> 00:44:25,412
- Daddy, this is my friend RJ.

819
00:44:25,412 --> 00:44:27,382
Can she please stay for dinner?

820
00:44:27,382 --> 00:44:28,846
- Sure.

821
00:44:28,846 --> 00:44:30,322
Nice to meet you RJ.

822
00:44:30,322 --> 00:44:32,540
- Nice to meet you too, sir.

823
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:33,856
Ma'am.

824
00:44:33,856 --> 00:44:35,649
- That's Peyton.

825
00:44:35,649 --> 00:44:37,103
- Girls.

826
00:44:37,103 --> 00:44:39,341
- And, uh, you are.

827
00:44:39,341 --> 00:44:40,291
- Very funny, Dad.

828
00:44:40,291 --> 00:44:41,612
I hope you have the same sense of humor

829
00:44:41,612 --> 00:44:43,080
when report cards come out.

830
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:45,783
- Well, I was about to
say the same thing to you.

831
00:44:45,783 --> 00:44:47,464
(phone rings)

832
00:44:47,464 --> 00:44:50,547
You girls go ahead, I'll be right in.

833
00:44:51,483 --> 00:44:55,566
No, go ahead with the
girls, I'll be right there.

834
00:44:57,245 --> 00:44:58,078
"Spycat."

835
00:45:01,324 --> 00:45:02,157
- Ah.

836
00:45:05,641 --> 00:45:06,960
So, Desi, darling.

837
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:08,393
Disguising yourself as a girl

838
00:45:08,393 --> 00:45:11,972
to avoid any further scuffle
with the opposite sex?

839
00:45:11,972 --> 00:45:14,321
- You know, you have the
most beautiful blond hair

840
00:45:14,321 --> 00:45:15,740
I've seen in a while.

841
00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:17,823
- Why thank you, darling.

842
00:45:19,672 --> 00:45:22,455
I do admit it is luxurious.

843
00:45:22,455 --> 00:45:25,636
- Do you mind if I ask what shade that is?

844
00:45:25,636 --> 00:45:28,610
- Oh, my dear, this is my natural color.

845
00:45:28,610 --> 00:45:30,193
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

846
00:45:31,386 --> 00:45:33,654
I saw the dark roots and
just assumed it was dyed.

847
00:45:33,654 --> 00:45:35,154
Please forgive me.

848
00:45:38,454 --> 00:45:42,537
- [Cameron] Well, sorry
to keep everyone waiting.

849
00:45:45,101 --> 00:45:46,962
So, RJ, where are you from?

850
00:45:46,962 --> 00:45:49,861
- My family's from all
over the Pacific Northwest,

851
00:45:49,861 --> 00:45:51,890
but I grew up in Montana.

852
00:45:51,890 --> 00:45:55,468
- Really, well, my wife,
Desi's mother was from Montana.

853
00:45:55,468 --> 00:45:58,329
Actually, that's where
I met Regan, my wife.

854
00:45:58,329 --> 00:46:02,357
She, uh was bicycling along a dirt road

855
00:46:02,357 --> 00:46:06,524
and I was driving on my
way to a business meeting.

856
00:46:07,589 --> 00:46:10,898
All of a sudden I hit this huge
mud puddle and blew a tire.

857
00:46:10,898 --> 00:46:12,749
Well, it scared her so
much she fell off the bike.

858
00:46:12,749 --> 00:46:15,119
She was all covered with mud.

859
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:17,086
And I went over to try to help her.

860
00:46:17,086 --> 00:46:18,746
All I did was make it worse.

861
00:46:18,746 --> 00:46:22,316
But before I could even
speak she looked up at me

862
00:46:22,316 --> 00:46:25,316
with these big beautiful brown eyes.

863
00:46:26,727 --> 00:46:28,810
I fell in love like that.

864
00:46:33,968 --> 00:46:34,801
Oh, well.

865
00:46:34,801 --> 00:46:37,459
(all laughing)

866
00:46:37,459 --> 00:46:39,122
I guess got a little carried away.

867
00:46:39,122 --> 00:46:41,369
Don't mean to bore you with old sentiment.

868
00:46:41,369 --> 00:46:44,215
- Oh, I love hearing that story.

869
00:46:44,215 --> 00:46:47,440
But Mom told a slightly different tale.

870
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:49,791
- Oh, I'm sure that's true.

871
00:46:49,791 --> 00:46:53,708
- Will someone please
pass the mashed potatoes?

872
00:46:58,768 --> 00:47:02,518
I don't see what's so
romantic about the mud.

873
00:47:04,021 --> 00:47:06,040
(Peyton screaming)

874
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:08,957
(Peyton screaming)

875
00:47:11,361 --> 00:47:12,848
Oh, my dress.

876
00:47:12,848 --> 00:47:13,765
- My salad.

877
00:47:14,907 --> 00:47:17,407
- A little dressing with that.

878
00:47:20,250 --> 00:47:21,758
(Peyton screaming)

879
00:47:21,758 --> 00:47:23,008
- Who did that?

880
00:47:24,092 --> 00:47:25,793
Who did that?

881
00:47:25,793 --> 00:47:28,448
- Would you like me to
get you some Club Soda?

882
00:47:28,448 --> 00:47:31,702
(Peyton screaming)

883
00:47:31,702 --> 00:47:32,535
- Peyton.

884
00:47:33,667 --> 00:47:35,492
You guys, come on.

885
00:47:35,492 --> 00:47:38,075
(all laughing)

886
00:47:50,022 --> 00:47:51,892
- Like my father always said,

887
00:47:51,892 --> 00:47:53,731
what goes around comes around

888
00:47:53,731 --> 00:47:57,057
is better served up with mashed potatoes.

889
00:47:57,057 --> 00:47:58,307
Think about it.

890
00:48:01,642 --> 00:48:05,675
(girls laughing)
(Melanie chuckling)

891
00:48:05,675 --> 00:48:08,092
(bell rings)

892
00:48:09,353 --> 00:48:11,936
(bus rumbling)

893
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:14,969
- Desi, Desi, where have you been?

894
00:48:14,969 --> 00:48:16,591
I've been calling you for three days.

895
00:48:16,591 --> 00:48:17,640
- I've been around.

896
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:19,409
- I need you to give this to Tyler for me.

897
00:48:19,409 --> 00:48:20,617
- Why me?

898
00:48:20,617 --> 00:48:23,200
- Because I'm being coy, dummy.

899
00:48:25,331 --> 00:48:26,280
- Hey, Desi.

900
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:27,881
Peyton wants to show me a condo she found.

901
00:48:27,881 --> 00:48:28,839
You girls want to come?

902
00:48:28,839 --> 00:48:30,471
- Condo, what condo?

903
00:48:30,471 --> 00:48:31,621
- Is this your car?

904
00:48:31,621 --> 00:48:32,454
Come on, Desi.

905
00:48:32,454 --> 00:48:34,123
Let's go for a ride in the Jag.

906
00:48:34,123 --> 00:48:35,111
Definitely, Mr. Brooks.

907
00:48:35,111 --> 00:48:36,361
- OK, let's go.

908
00:48:39,101 --> 00:48:40,168
- [Gaynor] Great car.

909
00:48:40,168 --> 00:48:41,001
- Thanks.

910
00:48:46,375 --> 00:48:49,042
Is this a fabulous view or what?

911
00:48:54,662 --> 00:48:55,912
- Unbelievable.

912
00:48:57,118 --> 00:49:00,817
- Cameron, look at this
perfect morning light.

913
00:49:00,817 --> 00:49:03,638
And everyone who's anyone lives here.

914
00:49:03,638 --> 00:49:04,975
- Looks great.

915
00:49:04,975 --> 00:49:06,587
Can you afford this?

916
00:49:06,587 --> 00:49:08,206
- Me?

917
00:49:08,206 --> 00:49:10,596
- Wow, I think this is Greek marble.

918
00:49:10,596 --> 00:49:12,507
Greek marble is the best.

919
00:49:12,507 --> 00:49:14,180
My mom says so.

920
00:49:14,180 --> 00:49:15,013
- Really?

921
00:49:16,054 --> 00:49:17,387
- Look, darling.

922
00:49:18,294 --> 00:49:20,127
It's partly furnished.

923
00:49:21,404 --> 00:49:23,735
- You mean you want me to buy this place?

924
00:49:23,735 --> 00:49:25,174
- Well, of course.

925
00:49:25,174 --> 00:49:27,463
You need a place like
this to promote the image

926
00:49:27,463 --> 00:49:29,854
of a successful artist.

927
00:49:29,854 --> 00:49:33,135
An image I'm working so
very hard to build for you.

928
00:49:33,135 --> 00:49:37,094
- Well, but, but, this place
doesn't even have a bedroom.

929
00:49:37,094 --> 00:49:39,761
(Peyton laughs)

930
00:49:45,455 --> 00:49:46,870
(bed booming)

931
00:49:46,870 --> 00:49:48,002
- Voila.

932
00:49:48,002 --> 00:49:50,071
You sleep here.

933
00:49:50,071 --> 00:49:51,842
And they even have daily maid service

934
00:49:51,842 --> 00:49:54,722
so you can get rid of Miss Morningface.

935
00:49:54,722 --> 00:49:56,071
- Morningside.

936
00:49:56,071 --> 00:49:58,271
And what about Desi.

937
00:49:58,271 --> 00:50:00,258
- With the kind of money you'll be making

938
00:50:00,258 --> 00:50:03,810
you can afford to send her
to the best private schools

939
00:50:03,810 --> 00:50:05,482
in this country.

940
00:50:05,482 --> 00:50:07,181
Or Switzerland.

941
00:50:07,181 --> 00:50:08,348
- Switzerland?

942
00:50:12,711 --> 00:50:13,544
- Come on, Desi.

943
00:50:13,544 --> 00:50:14,668
Let's go check out the pool.

944
00:50:14,668 --> 00:50:17,539
There might be some cute boys up there.

945
00:50:17,539 --> 00:50:19,189
- No, I don't want to.

946
00:50:19,189 --> 00:50:20,654
- Come on, Desi.

947
00:50:20,654 --> 00:50:22,638
- Gaynor, can you just
hold off on chasing boys

948
00:50:22,638 --> 00:50:24,227
for like two seconds.

949
00:50:24,227 --> 00:50:25,687
- I'm just doing it for you.

950
00:50:25,687 --> 00:50:28,016
You know, everyone's saying
how you can't find a boy

951
00:50:28,016 --> 00:50:29,244
to take to my party.

952
00:50:29,244 --> 00:50:31,756
Frankly, you're embarrassing me.

953
00:50:31,756 --> 00:50:32,839
- Is that so?

954
00:50:36,106 --> 00:50:36,939
- Come on.

955
00:50:38,218 --> 00:50:40,500
- But Peyton, I can't take
Desi away from her school

956
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:41,804
and all of her friends.

957
00:50:41,804 --> 00:50:43,700
- I told you not to say anything

958
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:46,260
'til you've seen the whole thing.

959
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:48,843
Wait 'til you see the bathroom.

960
00:50:50,620 --> 00:50:52,620
Well, what do you think?

961
00:50:57,370 --> 00:51:01,953
- Well, maybe living here
wouldn't be so bad after all.

962
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:09,021
- Wow, you can see the mall from here.

963
00:51:09,021 --> 00:51:12,521
- I've never seen a pool on a roof before.

964
00:51:18,496 --> 00:51:19,329
- Hi.

965
00:51:20,869 --> 00:51:21,702
- Hi.

966
00:51:22,990 --> 00:51:24,899
- Are you moving in?

967
00:51:24,899 --> 00:51:27,738
- No, but my friend here might be.

968
00:51:27,738 --> 00:51:29,040
- You're kidding?

969
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:30,327
- No, really.

970
00:51:30,327 --> 00:51:32,298
- Can your family afford it?

971
00:51:32,298 --> 00:51:33,967
- My father's an artist.

972
00:51:33,967 --> 00:51:36,634
- Artist's don't have any money.

973
00:51:37,679 --> 00:51:39,359
- He does a comic strip called "Spycat."

974
00:51:39,359 --> 00:51:41,159
Have you seen it?

975
00:51:41,159 --> 00:51:42,471
- We don't read comics.

976
00:51:42,471 --> 00:51:45,471
(bluesy jazz music)

977
00:51:52,848 --> 00:51:55,328
(water splashing)

978
00:51:55,328 --> 00:51:58,377
- Just think about the condo.

979
00:51:58,377 --> 00:51:59,915
But don't take too long.

980
00:51:59,915 --> 00:52:01,968
I have them at an advantage.

981
00:52:01,968 --> 00:52:06,468
It's now a buyers market
with lower capital gains tax.

982
00:52:17,018 --> 00:52:20,018
(jazzy piano music)

983
00:52:27,952 --> 00:52:30,845
- Yeah, give me the meat department.

984
00:52:30,845 --> 00:52:33,012
(humming)

985
00:52:36,847 --> 00:52:38,966
Yeah, Jake, it's Mabel.

986
00:52:38,966 --> 00:52:41,116
Give me four pounds ground round,

987
00:52:41,116 --> 00:52:42,977
one pound bacon, lean.

988
00:52:42,977 --> 00:52:44,537
Oh yeah, and another
one of those briskets.

989
00:52:44,537 --> 00:52:46,948
Mr. Brooks really liked it.

990
00:52:46,948 --> 00:52:49,988
Yeah, wrap it up and put it on my account.

991
00:52:49,988 --> 00:52:52,797
Yeah, I know it's overdue.

992
00:52:52,797 --> 00:52:55,125
How long have you been my butcher?

993
00:52:55,125 --> 00:52:56,955
And you've always gotten paid haven't you?

994
00:52:56,955 --> 00:52:59,684
Well, then wrap it up and
I'll see you this afternoon.

995
00:52:59,684 --> 00:53:04,434
Oh, and remember, Jake, people
in need are people indeed.

996
00:53:05,454 --> 00:53:06,704
Think about it.

997
00:53:15,916 --> 00:53:18,583
(ball bouncing)

998
00:53:28,802 --> 00:53:31,317
- Hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey, that was traveling.

999
00:53:31,317 --> 00:53:34,004
- Come on, Dad, they never
call traveling now days.

1000
00:53:34,004 --> 00:53:35,404
- Oh yeah, since when?

1001
00:53:35,404 --> 00:53:38,313
- [Desi] Since the last
time you played, maybe.

1002
00:53:38,313 --> 00:53:39,407
Get with it, Dad.

1003
00:53:39,407 --> 00:53:41,074
- [Cameron] Oh yeah.

1004
00:53:44,868 --> 00:53:48,239
(magical twinkling)

1005
00:53:48,239 --> 00:53:51,087
(net rustling)

1006
00:53:51,087 --> 00:53:52,418
- [Desi] Nice shot.

1007
00:53:52,418 --> 00:53:53,539
- [Cameron] My ball.

1008
00:53:53,539 --> 00:53:54,703
- New rules, Dad.

1009
00:53:54,703 --> 00:53:58,370
- Hey, hey, hey, no
way, my house, my rules.

1010
00:54:00,901 --> 00:54:04,151
So, what did you think about the condo?

1011
00:54:08,006 --> 00:54:10,139
Yeah, I thought so.

1012
00:54:10,139 --> 00:54:11,017
Probably think the same thing

1013
00:54:11,017 --> 00:54:14,664
about the new changes in "Spycat," huh?

1014
00:54:14,664 --> 00:54:16,727
Hey, come here.

1015
00:54:16,727 --> 00:54:19,246
I know I'm not any good at this.

1016
00:54:19,246 --> 00:54:20,382
Not like your mother would have been,

1017
00:54:20,382 --> 00:54:22,799
but you're a young woman now.

1018
00:54:24,795 --> 00:54:26,378
We can always talk.

1019
00:54:27,791 --> 00:54:29,939
I don't know, sometimes I,

1020
00:54:29,939 --> 00:54:33,022
I think you and I are drifting apart.

1021
00:54:36,317 --> 00:54:38,628
Hey, you know what?

1022
00:54:38,628 --> 00:54:42,179
I think I miss her laugh
more than anything.

1023
00:54:42,179 --> 00:54:46,346
No matter how badly I felt,
gosh I miss her laugh.

1024
00:54:48,663 --> 00:54:50,151
- I miss her singing.

1025
00:54:50,151 --> 00:54:51,818
- Oh, yeah, exactly.

1026
00:54:53,162 --> 00:54:57,782
Whenever we'd hear her sing,
it'd always cheer us up.

1027
00:54:57,782 --> 00:54:59,948
- I miss her, Dad.

1028
00:54:59,948 --> 00:55:02,350
(Cameron sighing)

1029
00:55:02,350 --> 00:55:03,870
- I do too.

1030
00:55:03,870 --> 00:55:04,703
Come on.

1031
00:55:12,206 --> 00:55:13,956
Hey, I love you, Des.

1032
00:55:15,093 --> 00:55:17,892
- I love you too, Daddy.

1033
00:55:17,892 --> 00:55:19,179
- Don't stay up too late, huh?

1034
00:55:19,179 --> 00:55:20,179
- OK, Daddy.

1035
00:55:24,967 --> 00:55:28,717
Daddy.
(contemplative music)

1036
00:55:46,822 --> 00:55:49,494
(phone rings)

1037
00:55:49,494 --> 00:55:52,059
- Hello, Brooks residence.

1038
00:55:52,059 --> 00:55:53,801
Yeah, who is this?

1039
00:55:53,801 --> 00:55:54,910
Jake the Butcher.

1040
00:55:54,910 --> 00:55:55,743
Yeah, I'm sorry.

1041
00:55:55,743 --> 00:55:57,733
You got the wrong number.

1042
00:55:57,733 --> 00:55:59,491
Think about it.

1043
00:55:59,491 --> 00:56:01,970
(insects chirping)

1044
00:56:01,970 --> 00:56:05,637
(contemplative piano music)

1045
00:57:59,342 --> 00:58:00,175
- Oh, no.

1046
00:58:02,782 --> 00:58:03,865
What do I do?

1047
00:58:07,096 --> 00:58:08,179
What do I do?

1048
00:58:16,436 --> 00:58:19,019
(Desi sighing)

1049
00:58:20,295 --> 00:58:21,795
No guts, no glory.

1050
00:58:53,619 --> 00:58:54,536
Hey, Tyler?

1051
00:58:56,125 --> 00:58:57,614
Tyler!

1052
00:58:57,614 --> 00:58:59,075
- Not now.

1053
00:58:59,075 --> 00:59:03,828
Can't you see, I'm trying
to school this little punk.

1054
00:59:03,828 --> 00:59:05,073
- Sorry.

1055
00:59:05,073 --> 00:59:06,240
Suit yourself.

1056
00:59:11,996 --> 00:59:12,996
Hey, Legget.

1057
00:59:15,368 --> 00:59:16,550
- Hey.

1058
00:59:16,550 --> 00:59:18,691
I don't think I want to
play with you anymore.

1059
00:59:18,691 --> 00:59:21,531
- I, I know, I'm really,
really sorry about your eye.

1060
00:59:21,531 --> 00:59:22,990
- Oh, that's OK.

1061
00:59:22,990 --> 00:59:24,406
You play tough.

1062
00:59:24,406 --> 00:59:26,401
- So have you heard about Gaynor's party?

1063
00:59:26,401 --> 00:59:28,417
- Yeah, Tyler told me about it.

1064
00:59:28,417 --> 00:59:30,639
He's pretty steamed Gaynor
hasn't asked him yet.

1065
00:59:30,639 --> 00:59:31,722
- No kidding.

1066
00:59:33,668 --> 00:59:38,418
So, um, you think, maybe, do
you think you might want to,

1067
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:43,153
I mean.

1068
00:59:44,844 --> 00:59:45,844
- Hi, Perry.

1069
00:59:48,877 --> 00:59:49,987
- Hi, Pleasance.

1070
00:59:49,987 --> 00:59:51,665
- My mom said she'd take us to the party

1071
00:59:51,665 --> 00:59:53,709
if that's OK with you.

1072
00:59:53,709 --> 00:59:55,126
- Sure, whatever.

1073
00:59:56,966 --> 00:59:58,568
- Hi, Desi.

1074
00:59:58,568 --> 00:59:59,901
- Hi, Pleasance.

1075
01:00:01,248 --> 01:00:03,679
- Want to go to Eleven?

1076
01:00:03,679 --> 01:00:05,666
(car horn honks)

1077
01:00:05,666 --> 01:00:06,499
- I, I.

1078
01:00:09,488 --> 01:00:12,071
(horn honking)

1079
01:00:17,739 --> 01:00:19,039
I gotta go.

1080
01:00:19,039 --> 01:00:20,372
- Yeah, see you.

1081
01:00:25,149 --> 01:00:27,570
- I promised your father
I'd take you shopping.

1082
01:00:27,570 --> 01:00:28,403
Get in.

1083
01:00:43,728 --> 01:00:44,969
Listen, Desi.

1084
01:00:44,969 --> 01:00:46,927
I think we got off to a bad start.

1085
01:00:46,927 --> 01:00:50,997
So, let's just set the record straight.

1086
01:00:50,997 --> 01:00:52,745
I'm here to help your father.

1087
01:00:52,745 --> 01:00:56,539
He's on the verge of becoming
an incredible success.

1088
01:00:56,539 --> 01:01:00,130
Which is good for both me and you.

1089
01:01:00,130 --> 01:01:02,981
The only thing that stands
in the way of his success

1090
01:01:02,981 --> 01:01:04,461
is your approval.

1091
01:01:04,461 --> 01:01:06,219
He feels you're unhappy with the changes

1092
01:01:06,219 --> 01:01:08,139
going on in his life.

1093
01:01:08,139 --> 01:01:12,088
So, having said that, let
me put it to you this way.

1094
01:01:12,088 --> 01:01:15,395
Those changes will be made
with or without your help.

1095
01:01:15,395 --> 01:01:20,228
It might take longer, but the
end result will be the same.

1096
01:01:22,420 --> 01:01:23,805
I knew there was a smart little girl

1097
01:01:23,805 --> 01:01:27,222
hiding under that baseball cap someplace.

1098
01:01:28,077 --> 01:01:31,237
Now let's get that
shopping thing done with.

1099
01:01:31,237 --> 01:01:34,237
(bluesy rock music)

1100
01:03:08,267 --> 01:03:09,350
Hello, hello?

1101
01:03:12,552 --> 01:03:14,731
- Well, I hope you had fun

1102
01:03:14,731 --> 01:03:17,451
and I hope I still have credit left.

1103
01:03:17,451 --> 01:03:21,688
- We have transformed your
daughter into a fashion plate.

1104
01:03:21,688 --> 01:03:23,181
It was a rousing success.

1105
01:03:23,181 --> 01:03:24,140
Wasn't it, Desi?

1106
01:03:24,140 --> 01:03:25,017
- Yes.

1107
01:03:25,017 --> 01:03:27,324
- You may want to let this cool off

1108
01:03:27,324 --> 01:03:29,507
before you put it in your wallet.

1109
01:03:29,507 --> 01:03:32,528
- Well, if it makes Desi happy,
I'm sure it's well worth it.

1110
01:03:32,528 --> 01:03:33,749
- Happy?

1111
01:03:33,749 --> 01:03:35,568
Of course she's happy.

1112
01:03:35,568 --> 01:03:36,829
- Now may I please go upstairs?

1113
01:03:36,829 --> 01:03:37,912
- Yeah, sure.

1114
01:03:41,530 --> 01:03:44,210
- You've got some kid there.

1115
01:03:44,210 --> 01:03:45,629
Well, I'm off.

1116
01:03:45,629 --> 01:03:47,945
I've got a million things to do.

1117
01:03:47,945 --> 01:03:50,128
I'm putting in your bid on the condo.

1118
01:03:50,128 --> 01:03:52,277
I'll be back later for the unveiling.

1119
01:03:52,277 --> 01:03:54,167
I promised the girls I'd
drive them to the party

1120
01:03:54,167 --> 01:03:55,827
in the Jaguar.

1121
01:03:55,827 --> 01:03:58,444
Their friends will be green with envy.

1122
01:03:58,444 --> 01:03:59,277
Bye now!

1123
01:04:05,688 --> 01:04:07,177
- [RJ] Desi, Desi, are you there?

1124
01:04:07,177 --> 01:04:10,344
(contemplative music)

1125
01:04:11,790 --> 01:04:12,841
- Oh, come on up.

1126
01:04:12,841 --> 01:04:16,258
Just wait until I tell you about my plan.

1127
01:04:24,531 --> 01:04:25,630
The only thing I'm worried about

1128
01:04:25,630 --> 01:04:28,932
is if my dad would like
me better this way.

1129
01:04:28,932 --> 01:04:31,980
Sure seems to like Peyton the way she is.

1130
01:04:31,980 --> 01:04:34,090
- Your father is caught up in a place

1131
01:04:34,090 --> 01:04:36,280
that says you have to be a certain way

1132
01:04:36,280 --> 01:04:39,469
and act a certain way in
order to be successful.

1133
01:04:39,469 --> 01:04:42,388
He doesn't see things
the way they really are.

1134
01:04:42,388 --> 01:04:43,747
He means well.

1135
01:04:43,747 --> 01:04:46,060
And he really is only thinking of you.

1136
01:04:46,060 --> 01:04:50,463
But right now, all he can see
is the shine on the apple.

1137
01:04:50,463 --> 01:04:53,218
But you are gonna help him clear the fog.

1138
01:04:53,218 --> 01:04:55,486
And get a real good look at things to come

1139
01:04:55,486 --> 01:04:57,798
if they're left in certain hands.

1140
01:04:57,798 --> 01:04:59,798
If you know what I mean.

1141
01:05:14,158 --> 01:05:16,741
(tire hissing)

1142
01:05:21,675 --> 01:05:23,585
(Peyton groans)

1143
01:05:23,585 --> 01:05:26,041
(phone rings)

1144
01:05:26,041 --> 01:05:28,895
- Hello, Brooks residence.

1145
01:05:28,895 --> 01:05:30,687
Who's calling?

1146
01:05:30,687 --> 01:05:33,093
Clayton, oh, excuse me, Peyton.

1147
01:05:33,093 --> 01:05:34,593
One moment please.

1148
01:05:35,677 --> 01:05:38,010
- [Peyton] Cameron, Cameron?

1149
01:05:43,286 --> 01:05:44,119
- [Desi] Where are they?

1150
01:05:44,119 --> 01:05:45,040
- I don't know.

1151
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:45,901
Miss Morningside?

1152
01:05:45,901 --> 01:05:47,120
Mr. Brooks.

1153
01:05:47,120 --> 01:05:49,037
Hold on a second, Desi.

1154
01:05:51,430 --> 01:05:55,207
Miss Morningside must
have gone to the market.

1155
01:05:55,207 --> 01:05:57,374
Oh, this might explain it.

1156
01:05:58,981 --> 01:06:01,058
(jazzy piano music)

1157
01:06:01,058 --> 01:06:03,160
- [Desi] What's going on?

1158
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:06,039
- Desi, Peyton called, had a flat tire,

1159
01:06:06,039 --> 01:06:07,208
asked me to pick her up.

1160
01:06:07,208 --> 01:06:08,989
Sit tight, we'll be back very shortly

1161
01:06:08,989 --> 01:06:11,069
to give you a ride to
the party, love, Dad.

1162
01:06:11,069 --> 01:06:14,657
- Of course she calls my
father instead of a garage.

1163
01:06:14,657 --> 01:06:16,157
- Wait, I have an idea.

1164
01:06:16,157 --> 01:06:17,491
Do you have a camera?

1165
01:06:17,491 --> 01:06:19,324
- Yeah, in the closet.

1166
01:06:27,929 --> 01:06:29,012
- Say cheese.

1167
01:06:30,653 --> 01:06:31,486
- Cheese.

1168
01:06:33,909 --> 01:06:35,742
Let me write the note.

1169
01:06:42,739 --> 01:06:46,315
Great idea RJ, this ought to
shake things up a bit more.

1170
01:06:46,315 --> 01:06:48,722
- Oh, but where are you going?

1171
01:06:48,722 --> 01:06:50,531
- Well, I wouldn't go
to the party like this.

1172
01:06:50,531 --> 01:06:51,780
- Of course.

1173
01:06:51,780 --> 01:06:53,113
Let me help you.

1174
01:07:14,609 --> 01:07:16,040
- I think the number for the garage

1175
01:07:16,040 --> 01:07:18,250
is by the phone in the kitchen.

1176
01:07:18,250 --> 01:07:20,998
Just let me see if Desi's ready.

1177
01:07:20,998 --> 01:07:21,831
What?

1178
01:07:25,231 --> 01:07:26,747
"Daddy, wanted to surprise you

1179
01:07:26,747 --> 01:07:29,798
"with the new things Peyton
bought me, but it got late.

1180
01:07:29,798 --> 01:07:32,329
"So I hitched a ride to the party.

1181
01:07:32,329 --> 01:07:35,049
"I'll see you when I get
home but don't wait up.

1182
01:07:35,049 --> 01:07:35,882
Left a picture.

1183
01:07:35,882 --> 01:07:36,804
"Tell Peyton I said thanks.

1184
01:07:36,804 --> 01:07:38,655
Bye, for now, Desi."

1185
01:07:38,655 --> 01:07:40,645
Hitched a ride?

1186
01:07:40,645 --> 01:07:41,812
Don't wait up?

1187
01:07:44,343 --> 01:07:47,414
(dramatic music)

1188
01:07:47,414 --> 01:07:48,473
Peyton!

1189
01:07:48,473 --> 01:07:49,414
Peyton!

1190
01:07:49,414 --> 01:07:51,493
- What on earth are you screaming about?

1191
01:07:51,493 --> 01:07:52,442
- What have you done?

1192
01:07:52,442 --> 01:07:53,565
Are you out of your mind?

1193
01:07:53,565 --> 01:07:54,893
- Cameron, you're scaring me.

1194
01:07:54,893 --> 01:07:56,023
What are you talking about?

1195
01:07:56,023 --> 01:07:58,801
- This, I am talking about this!

1196
01:07:58,801 --> 01:08:00,775
- Oh, black really isn't her color.

1197
01:08:00,775 --> 01:08:02,824
(Cameron exclaiming)

1198
01:08:02,824 --> 01:08:04,074
Cameron, calm down.

1199
01:08:04,074 --> 01:08:05,241
You're raving.

1200
01:08:06,082 --> 01:08:07,574
Look, what's the problem?

1201
01:08:07,574 --> 01:08:09,085
For the first time in
her dreary little life

1202
01:08:09,085 --> 01:08:11,545
she's showing some promise.

1203
01:08:11,545 --> 01:08:14,141
- Desi is a 13 year old girl.

1204
01:08:14,141 --> 01:08:16,496
- Well, I happen to like those clothes.

1205
01:08:16,496 --> 01:08:18,082
- We are gonna find my baby girl

1206
01:08:18,082 --> 01:08:20,142
and you are gonna put her back
just the way you found her.

1207
01:08:20,142 --> 01:08:21,892
Do you understand me?

1208
01:08:23,362 --> 01:08:26,290
- She was gonna go with that boy, Legget.

1209
01:08:26,290 --> 01:08:29,484
Maybe she got a ride with him.

1210
01:08:29,484 --> 01:08:30,942
- A ride?

1211
01:08:30,942 --> 01:08:31,775
A boy?

1212
01:08:33,580 --> 01:08:36,913
She's with a boy and
she's dressed like this?

1213
01:08:36,913 --> 01:08:37,746
You!

1214
01:08:39,012 --> 01:08:39,845
Move!

1215
01:08:43,454 --> 01:08:44,324
- [Peyton] Cameron, please,

1216
01:08:44,324 --> 01:08:47,324
everything is going to be just fine.

1217
01:08:49,737 --> 01:08:52,454
(girls laughing)

1218
01:08:52,454 --> 01:08:53,616
- I think it worked.

1219
01:08:53,616 --> 01:08:55,805
- Your father sounded pretty upset.

1220
01:08:55,805 --> 01:08:56,805
- You think?

1221
01:08:58,094 --> 01:08:59,964
Wait, they went to
Gaynor's to look for me.

1222
01:08:59,964 --> 01:09:04,297
We have to find them before
he does something crazy.

1223
01:09:05,906 --> 01:09:07,730
- What is this?

1224
01:09:07,730 --> 01:09:10,640
(playful tone)

1225
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:12,473
Good heavens, my baby!

1226
01:09:15,939 --> 01:09:19,022

1238
01:10:04,453 --> 01:10:08,219
You haven't seen anything yet, hotpants.

1239
01:10:08,219 --> 01:10:09,760
There's the little squirt.

1240

1243
01:10:18,811 --> 01:10:21,246
- OK, if you say so, Mr. Brooks.

1244
01:10:21,246 --> 01:10:22,651
- Are you out of your mind?

1245
01:10:22,651 --> 01:10:24,119
- I, I don't know.

1246
01:10:24,119 --> 01:10:25,319
- You're not Desi.

1247
01:10:25,319 --> 01:10:26,152
- No, sir.

1248
01:10:27,758 --> 01:10:29,008
- Where's Desi?

1249
01:10:30,257 --> 01:10:34,090
- Just what do you think
you're doing, Brooks?

1250
01:10:35,576 --> 01:10:36,756
- Dad!

1251
01:10:36,756 --> 01:10:38,207
- Desi!

1252
01:10:38,207 --> 01:10:39,040
Hey!

1253
01:10:41,128 --> 01:10:42,718
Watch it!

1254
01:10:42,718 --> 01:10:43,668
- Daddy, Daddy!

1255
01:10:43,668 --> 01:10:45,202
Stop it, stop it!

1256
01:10:45,202 --> 01:10:47,190
You're ruining my party!

1257
01:10:47,190 --> 01:10:49,460
(men screaming)

1258
01:10:49,460 --> 01:10:54,460
(crowd laughing)
(playful music)

1259
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:00,787
- Get me the police!

1260
01:11:05,424 --> 01:11:10,424
(Cameron screams)
(man laughing)

1261
01:11:10,594 --> 01:11:12,726
(pie squishing)

1262
01:11:12,726 --> 01:11:14,476
- Stop it, Daddy!

1263
01:11:14,476 --> 01:11:17,626
(all laughing)

1264
01:11:17,626 --> 01:11:19,709
- This is better than TV.

1265
01:11:26,836 --> 01:11:27,669
- Dad.

1266
01:11:28,826 --> 01:11:29,768
- What?

1267
01:11:29,768 --> 01:11:30,601
- [Mr. Martin] Hey, Brooks.

1268
01:11:30,601 --> 01:11:34,018
- What?
(pie splattering)

1269
01:11:36,081 --> 01:11:37,664
- Stop it, stop it!

1270
01:11:41,710 --> 01:11:42,968
- I saw that.

1271
01:11:42,968 --> 01:11:44,273
I saw that.

1272
01:11:44,273 --> 01:11:45,926
You get out of here, get out!

1273
01:11:45,926 --> 01:11:48,464
Out, oh!
(woman screaming)

1274
01:11:48,464 --> 01:11:49,297
Oh!

1275
01:11:50,276 --> 01:11:51,752
- Leave him alone.

1276
01:11:51,752 --> 01:11:54,502
(crowd laughing)

1277
01:12:00,627 --> 01:12:03,460
(woman screaming)

1278
01:12:06,879 --> 01:12:08,228
(cake splattering)
(Peyton screaming)

1279
01:12:08,228 --> 01:12:09,266
- My cake!

1280
01:12:09,266 --> 01:12:11,099
Somebody do something!

1281
01:12:12,656 --> 01:12:14,456
- Look at me!

1282
01:12:14,456 --> 01:12:15,289
My hair!

1283
01:12:16,674 --> 01:12:18,424
These are $300 shoes.

1284
01:12:20,365 --> 01:12:21,964
They're ruined!

1285
01:12:21,964 --> 01:12:24,381
(all laughs)

1286
01:12:25,306 --> 01:12:26,665
- My party!

1287
01:12:26,665 --> 01:12:28,796
- Bite me, will you!

1288
01:12:28,796 --> 01:12:33,796
(playful music)
(Peyton screams)

1289
01:12:37,532 --> 01:12:39,615
- I'm gonna sue somebody.

1290
01:12:40,467 --> 01:12:41,300
Anybody.

1291
01:12:41,300 --> 01:12:42,467
- Oh, shut up.

1292
01:12:43,445 --> 01:12:45,041
- What?

1293
01:12:45,041 --> 01:12:46,918
(pie splattering)
(Peyton screams)

1294
01:12:46,918 --> 01:12:51,918
(water splashing)
(all laughing)

1295
01:13:05,277 --> 01:13:06,110
Why, you.

1296
01:13:10,648 --> 01:13:12,858
They're designer.

1297
01:13:12,858 --> 01:13:15,685
(magical twinkling)

1298
01:13:15,685 --> 01:13:20,685
(water splashing)
(crowd laughing)

1299
01:13:24,268 --> 01:13:25,473
- [Cameron] Desi?

1300
01:13:25,473 --> 01:13:26,306
Desi?

1301
01:13:28,133 --> 01:13:28,971
- Des--
- Dad?

1302
01:13:28,971 --> 01:13:30,450
- Oh, thank God.

1303
01:13:30,450 --> 01:13:33,131
I saw the picture and you with the hat

1304
01:13:33,131 --> 01:13:35,298
then the pie and the cake.

1305
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:37,433
Oh no.

1306
01:13:40,321 --> 01:13:43,071
(Peyton wailing)

1307
01:13:44,084 --> 01:13:45,513
- Hurry, officers.

1308
01:13:45,513 --> 01:13:46,471
Come on.

1309
01:13:46,471 --> 01:13:49,961
There's the man who ruined
my little girl's party.

1310
01:13:49,961 --> 01:13:51,721
Get him, get him.

1311
01:13:51,721 --> 01:13:52,721
Lock him up.

1312
01:13:54,500 --> 01:13:55,798
- Dad!
- Wait, wait!

1313
01:13:55,798 --> 01:13:56,786
Wait I can explain everything.

1314
01:13:56,786 --> 01:13:58,437
- Dad.

1315
01:13:58,437 --> 01:14:00,662
(all laughing)

1316
01:14:00,662 --> 01:14:01,641
- In the car.

1317
01:14:01,641 --> 01:14:03,343
- You can tell us all about it downtown.

1318
01:14:03,343 --> 01:14:05,602
- Meet me at home.

1319
01:14:05,602 --> 01:14:06,435
Bye.

1320
01:14:06,435 --> 01:14:09,185
(crowd laughing)

1321
01:14:17,408 --> 01:14:18,788
- [Peyton] Excuse me.

1322
01:14:18,788 --> 01:14:21,568
Will someone please help me out of here?

1323
01:14:21,568 --> 01:14:22,768
Hello?

1324
01:14:22,768 --> 01:14:23,601
Hello?

1325
01:14:23,601 --> 01:14:26,684
(upbeat dance music)

1326
01:14:33,011 --> 01:14:35,500
(vocalizing)

1327
01:14:35,500 --> 01:14:40,500
♪ She's daddy's little girl ♪

1328
01:14:41,951 --> 01:14:45,861
♪ She's daddy's girl ♪

1329
01:14:45,861 --> 01:14:48,192
♪ She's 13, you know what it means ♪

1330
01:14:48,192 --> 01:14:51,151
♪ She's got a point to prove ♪

1331
01:14:51,151 --> 01:14:53,984
(engine rumbling)

1332
01:14:56,208 --> 01:14:58,958
(Cameron groans)

1333
01:15:01,294 --> 01:15:03,017
- Gracias, amigo.

1334
01:15:03,017 --> 01:15:04,532
Adios.

1335
01:15:04,532 --> 01:15:05,365
- Adios?

1336
01:15:05,365 --> 01:15:07,782
What do you mean, adios, $10.

1337
01:15:13,413 --> 01:15:14,246
Adios.

1338
01:15:15,933 --> 01:15:19,011
(engine rumbling)

1339
01:15:19,011 --> 01:15:20,948
(gentle piano music)

1340
01:15:20,948 --> 01:15:21,781
- Daddy!

1341
01:15:21,781 --> 01:15:23,114
- Oh, hey, baby.

1342
01:15:26,503 --> 01:15:29,618
Boy, I really made a
mess of things didn't I?

1343
01:15:29,618 --> 01:15:30,891
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

1344
01:15:30,891 --> 01:15:33,078
I was so worried about you.

1345
01:15:33,078 --> 01:15:33,971
It's all my fault.

1346
01:15:33,971 --> 01:15:34,888
- Hey, hey.

1347
01:15:36,391 --> 01:15:38,778
It's not your fault.

1348
01:15:38,778 --> 01:15:40,176
It's mine.

1349
01:15:40,176 --> 01:15:42,565
I had some time to think about things.

1350
01:15:42,565 --> 01:15:44,784
Next to a guy named Spider.

1351
01:15:44,784 --> 01:15:45,617
- Daddy.

1352
01:15:46,956 --> 01:15:48,517
Peyton didn't put me up to this.

1353
01:15:48,517 --> 01:15:50,467
I did it myself.

1354
01:15:50,467 --> 01:15:51,896
I'll apologize.

1355
01:15:51,896 --> 01:15:53,227
- Oh, hey, hey, hey.

1356
01:15:53,227 --> 01:15:56,894
It's all right, you
don't have to apologize.

1357
01:15:58,234 --> 01:16:01,743
Somewhere, sometime last night I,

1358
01:16:01,743 --> 01:16:03,145
I got a really good look at Peyton

1359
01:16:03,145 --> 01:16:05,978
and I didn't much like what I saw.

1360
01:16:07,716 --> 01:16:10,771
When I saw that picture of you

1361
01:16:10,771 --> 01:16:14,070
I saw Peyton rubbing off on our lives.

1362
01:16:14,070 --> 01:16:17,101
And I saw something I truly loved

1363
01:16:17,101 --> 01:16:19,684
being spoiled by some illusion.

1364
01:16:22,649 --> 01:16:24,791
You know what's even worse?

1365
01:16:24,791 --> 01:16:28,031
I got a real good picture of myself.

1366
01:16:28,031 --> 01:16:29,948
I liked that even less.

1367
01:16:31,040 --> 01:16:33,290
Hey, look, baby, I'm sorry.

1368
01:16:35,401 --> 01:16:40,401
I want you to be the beautiful
girl that you've always been.

1369
01:16:40,520 --> 01:16:43,930
I want you to be the best you possible.

1370
01:16:43,930 --> 01:16:46,347
Don't you change for anybody.

1371
01:16:47,589 --> 01:16:48,422
Come here.

1372
01:16:56,009 --> 01:16:58,676
You want to know something else.

1373
01:17:00,661 --> 01:17:02,863
I don't wanna change where we live.

1374
01:17:02,863 --> 01:17:04,853
And I don't want to change "Spycat."

1375
01:17:04,853 --> 01:17:07,343
I don't want anything to change.

1376
01:17:07,343 --> 01:17:08,587
- But, how are we gonna be--

1377
01:17:08,587 --> 01:17:09,420
- Hey.

1378
01:17:10,696 --> 01:17:13,478
You let me worry about the house.

1379
01:17:13,478 --> 01:17:17,016
I think you and me, we've got
to stick with what works, huh?

1380
01:17:17,016 --> 01:17:17,923
- Me do.

1381
01:17:17,923 --> 01:17:20,840
(Cameron chuckles)

1382
01:17:48,984 --> 01:17:50,443
- [RJ Voiceover] Dear, Destiny.

1383
01:17:50,443 --> 01:17:54,116
I'm sorry I couldn't stay for
your party, but I had to go.

1384
01:17:54,116 --> 01:17:56,374
You are your perfect age.

1385
01:17:56,374 --> 01:17:57,994
Everything will fall into place

1386
01:17:57,994 --> 01:18:01,579
and the world will start to
make a little more sense.

1387
01:18:01,579 --> 01:18:03,905
Believe in yourself,
trust in your own feelings

1388
01:18:03,905 --> 01:18:06,265
and remember that you are beautiful.

1389
01:18:06,265 --> 01:18:09,006
And special and very much loved.

1390
01:18:09,006 --> 01:18:13,076
You own that and no one can
ever take that away from you.

1391
01:18:13,076 --> 01:18:15,326
With all my heart, love RJ.

1392
01:19:07,387 --> 01:19:08,636
- Isn't this neat?

1393
01:19:08,636 --> 01:19:09,554
My mom wrapped it.

1394
01:19:09,554 --> 01:19:10,424
- Beautiful job.

1395
01:19:10,424 --> 01:19:12,984
Your mom's a regular artist.

1396
01:19:12,984 --> 01:19:14,711
- Hey, Brooks.

1397
01:19:14,711 --> 01:19:15,878
- Hey, Legget.

1398
01:19:17,055 --> 01:19:18,364
- You look really--

1399
01:19:18,364 --> 01:19:20,197
- Don't even go there.

1400
01:19:21,444 --> 01:19:22,277
Where's Dad?

1401
01:19:22,277 --> 01:19:24,404
- He just got an important phone call.

1402
01:19:24,404 --> 01:19:26,376
- Hey, guys, guys, great news!

1403
01:19:26,376 --> 01:19:27,976
You'll never guess what just happened.

1404
01:19:27,976 --> 01:19:30,785
I just got a call from a big
publishing house in New York.

1405
01:19:30,785 --> 01:19:32,085
They want "Spycat."

1406
01:19:32,085 --> 01:19:33,524
We're gonna be nationally syndicated

1407
01:19:33,524 --> 01:19:35,464
and we got our own comic book.

1408
01:19:35,464 --> 01:19:37,531
(all cheering)

1409
01:19:37,531 --> 01:19:38,856
- [Desi] Does that mean we don't--

1410
01:19:38,856 --> 01:19:39,689
- Yep.

1411
01:19:39,689 --> 01:19:42,356
We don't have to sell the house.

1412
01:19:43,425 --> 01:19:46,258
(camera clicking)

1413
01:19:47,689 --> 01:19:49,847
I just wish your mother could see you.

1414
01:19:49,847 --> 01:19:52,257
She'd be so proud of you.

1415
01:19:52,257 --> 01:19:53,905
- She can, Daddy.

1416
01:19:53,905 --> 01:19:55,155
She really can.

1417
01:19:56,786 --> 01:19:58,487
- OK, one more shot, all three of you.

1418
01:19:58,487 --> 01:19:59,320
Go on.

1419
01:20:00,646 --> 01:20:02,628
Ready, smile, say cheese.

1420
01:20:02,628 --> 01:20:04,617
- [All] Cheese!

1421
01:20:04,617 --> 01:20:06,308
- OK, this calls for a big celebration.

1422
01:20:06,308 --> 01:20:07,141
Come on!

1423
01:20:09,669 --> 01:20:12,252
(bright music)

1424
01:20:37,243 --> 01:20:38,430
- Here, here.

1425
01:20:38,430 --> 01:20:39,880
We're not brooding are we?

1426
01:20:39,880 --> 01:20:41,721
- No, not brooding.

1427
01:20:41,721 --> 01:20:43,380
Just thinking.

1428
01:20:43,380 --> 01:20:45,649
- You should be happy with
the way things turned out.

1429
01:20:45,649 --> 01:20:48,274
I think you did a wonderful job.

1430
01:20:48,274 --> 01:20:51,546
Although, you did take too many,

1431
01:20:51,546 --> 01:20:55,056
shall we say, heavenly liberties.

1432
01:20:55,056 --> 01:20:55,936
Don't worry.

1433
01:20:55,936 --> 01:20:58,107
It'll be our little secret.

1434
01:20:58,107 --> 01:20:59,536
I love the cake.

1435
01:20:59,536 --> 01:21:00,942
Nice touch.

1436
01:21:00,942 --> 01:21:01,775
