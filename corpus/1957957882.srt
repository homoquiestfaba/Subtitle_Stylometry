1
00:00:01,006 --> 00:00:03,589
(wind howling)

2
00:00:05,705 --> 00:00:09,038
(muffled radio chatter)

3
00:00:10,493 --> 00:00:15,493
(static noise)
(suspenseful music)

4
00:00:31,063 --> 00:00:34,230
(cameraman sniffling)

5
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:36,700
- Are we ready?

6
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:39,700
- Three, two, one, action.

7
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:42,300
- This evening, at the
infamous Amityville house,

8
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,400
something is about to go down,

9
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,830
and we at KC Channel
9, are here to report.

10
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:49,860
We've been following the
infamous goings on here

11
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,400
for several years.

12
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:54,870
From the hauntings, to the
murders, to the priest,

13
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:57,930
who has made it his mission
to stop whatever evil resides

14
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:02,396
in this house, on this
property, and in our nightmares.

15
00:01:02,396 --> 00:01:05,479
(car engine roaring)

16
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:08,280
Oh, here comes someone now.

17
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,294
Follow me.

18
00:01:09,294 --> 00:01:12,294
(suspenseful music)

19
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:17,573
Uh, excuse me, could you
tell us what's going on here?

20
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,764
- Salvation is what's going on here.

21
00:01:20,764 --> 00:01:23,040
(reporter gasping)
- You're Father Benna.

22
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,883
Are you here to perform an exorcism?

23
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:26,853
- Much greater.

24
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:32,360
This place, this house is evil incarnate.

25
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:35,120
Its evil has spread like a plague.

26
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:38,907
To stop it, we must strike at its roots.

27
00:01:38,907 --> 00:01:40,343
- Can you elaborate?

28
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:43,730
- I have followed its pathways

29
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:46,680
to extinguish its cancerous reach.

30
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,630
Home to home, family to family.

31
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:51,063
A path of devastation.

32
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:55,630
It's led me back here,
for a final confrontation

33
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:57,563
of good and evil.

34
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,110
- Is there anything else
you'd like to tell us?

35
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:08,083
- Yes, if I were you, I'd leave now.

36
00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:17,091
(door creaking open)

37
00:02:22,729 --> 00:02:25,054
(groaning noise)

38
00:02:25,054 --> 00:02:27,170
(door bangs shut)

39
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:28,310
- Did you see that?

40
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:30,203
The door shut on its own.

41
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:34,696
Hey, get back here, you chicken shit.

42
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:37,446
(groaning noise)

43
00:02:41,856 --> 00:02:44,147
- Yes, I know you are present,

44
00:02:44,147 --> 00:02:45,883
and you sense your time is up.

45
00:02:46,977 --> 00:02:49,498
- What sayeth you, man of the clothe?

46
00:02:49,498 --> 00:02:54,067
I was at the side of the
Christ you follow at one time.

47
00:02:54,067 --> 00:02:58,502
You can only dream of
being as omnipotent as he.

48
00:02:58,502 --> 00:02:59,419
You'll bow.

49
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:03,340
- You are a mere shadow of the Christ.

50
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:06,070
A failure, licking his wounds

51
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:10,531
and waiting for the day you
will be smote out for good.

52
00:03:10,531 --> 00:03:12,971
- And you are the one who are before me

53
00:03:12,971 --> 00:03:15,721
to execute this task, little man?

54
00:03:16,797 --> 00:03:19,714
(thunder crashing)

55
00:03:24,423 --> 00:03:27,356
- What the hell is going on in there?

56
00:03:27,356 --> 00:03:28,479
(suspenseful music)

57
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:29,520
- Hell is what's going on in there.

58
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,620
You need to step back.

59
00:03:31,834 --> 00:03:35,090
(bass filled laughing)

60
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:38,090
(suspenseful music)

61
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,330
- You, Beelzebub,

62
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:47,495
the dark one, Satan,

63
00:03:47,495 --> 00:03:48,453
Asmodeus,

64
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:54,630
I command you in the power of the almighty

65
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:58,393
that you hence leave
this house, this town.

66
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,127
As I command you, so does the living God.

67
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:07,379
- No one commands me, you little man.

68
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:09,373
Your god has left you.

69
00:04:09,373 --> 00:04:12,233
Now you serve at my side.

70
00:04:12,233 --> 00:04:15,260
(bass filled laughing)

71
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:18,813
- Never, my God will give me strength.

72
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:24,135
The cross compels you,
the cross compels you.

73
00:04:24,135 --> 00:04:27,005
(suspenseful music)

74
00:04:27,005 --> 00:04:29,672
(hissing sound)

75
00:04:31,077 --> 00:04:36,077
(Father Benna screaming)
(cracking sound)

76
00:04:46,447 --> 00:04:48,163
Dear God, dear God in heaven,
send it away from this earth.

77
00:04:53,366 --> 00:04:55,980
In spirit and in place.

78
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:57,897
In spirit and in place.

79
00:04:58,868 --> 00:05:03,868
(exploding noise)
(bass filled laughing)

80
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,646
- I am who you want.

81
00:05:10,646 --> 00:05:12,229
I cannot be lifted.

82
00:05:13,553 --> 00:05:15,713
- In spirit and in place.

83
00:05:15,713 --> 00:05:16,977
(loud hissing sound)

84
00:05:16,977 --> 00:05:18,060
Take it away.

85
00:05:18,965 --> 00:05:20,882
In spirit and in place.

86
00:05:21,776 --> 00:05:26,608
I sacrifice myself to rid
the world of this evil.

87
00:05:26,608 --> 00:05:28,108
Send us away, now.

88
00:05:29,858 --> 00:05:34,091
- [Legion] I can leave
with you, my priest.

89
00:05:34,091 --> 00:05:35,856
You will follow me in the veil.

90
00:05:35,856 --> 00:05:38,226
- What the fuck is going on here?

91
00:05:38,226 --> 00:05:41,309
(loud hissing noise)

92
00:05:42,686 --> 00:05:46,103
(Father Benna screaming)

93
00:05:49,106 --> 00:05:52,189
(upbeat tense music)

94
00:06:03,331 --> 00:06:06,581
(bass filled laughing)

95
00:06:13,003 --> 00:06:16,586
(upbeat suspenseful music)

96
00:08:46,148 --> 00:08:48,981
(machine beeping)

97
00:08:55,194 --> 00:08:58,027
(machine beeping)

98
00:09:00,578 --> 00:09:03,411
(machine beeping)

99
00:09:05,751 --> 00:09:08,584
(machine beeping)

100
00:09:11,082 --> 00:09:13,915
(machine beeping)

101
00:09:16,257 --> 00:09:19,090
(machine beeping)

102
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:33,823
(machine beeping)

103
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:39,773
- Deep breath.

104
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:44,663
(machine beeping)

105
00:09:47,187 --> 00:09:49,960
Well, that's interesting.

106
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:50,893
- Am I gonna live?

107
00:09:51,754 --> 00:09:54,860
- Oh, your blood pressure's
slightly elevated

108
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,360
as is your pulse.

109
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:59,150
- Well, I can tell you
the prognosis for that.

110
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:00,410
- What's that?

111
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:01,820
- It's from being too close to you

112
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:03,913
in this med lab all alone.

113
00:10:05,387 --> 00:10:07,880
- I think it's just space stress.

114
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,740
Come on, get dressed.

115
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:10,573
Zip up.

116
00:10:10,573 --> 00:10:11,860
- Oh, thanks doc.

117
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:14,760
Guess I don't get shipped home
because of medical reasons.

118
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:18,320
- Nope, you're in it for the long haul.

119
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,560
Just like the rest of us, Captain.

120
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,270
- Thank goodness this
mission is almost over.

121
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:25,913
These deep space runs
seem like an eternity.

122
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,110
How old's your son by now?

123
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:30,535
- He's three now, thanks.

124
00:10:30,535 --> 00:10:32,694
Thanks for asking.

125
00:10:32,694 --> 00:10:34,451
- Oh, hang in there.

126
00:10:34,451 --> 00:10:37,451
(suspenseful music)

127
00:10:45,175 --> 00:10:47,210
(beeping noise)

128
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:49,170
- My friend there's a black hole out there

129
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:50,613
with your name all over it.

130
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:02,830
Star log, 12478.

131
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:05,680
Black hole destroyer 52 pre-programmed

132
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,893
and armed for whenever duty calls for it.

133
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:16,350
- Ah, there's nothing more relaxing

134
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:19,430
than cruising through the stars.

135
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:21,257
- That is your job, is it not?

136
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:26,940
- Yes, it's my job, Vox.

137
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:29,870
Why do you have to ruin someone's fun

138
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:32,500
with your analytical logic?

139
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,460
- That is my job, Maitland.

140
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:38,560
At least 22.6% of my duties.

141
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,913
33%-
- You know what, Vox?

142
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:42,020
Stow it, Vox.

143
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:45,730
I don't need a rundown of your duties.

144
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:48,120
That's one thing's for sure.

145
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,243
- What is that?

146
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:55,003
- You're a pain in the
A-S-S 100% of the time.

147
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:58,517
- If you say so, Maitland.

148
00:11:58,517 --> 00:12:01,517
(suspenseful music)

149
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,044
- Greetings, Captain Halstead.

150
00:12:13,044 --> 00:12:14,390
- Greetings, Madam Tyse.

151
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:17,780
- The Space Conglomeration
extends our warmest gratitude

152
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:19,850
and admiration for the wonderful job

153
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:22,420
you and your crew are performing.

154
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:26,220
Thanks to your service,
space is safe for exploration

155
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:27,463
and colonization.

156
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:30,310
- Thank you, Madam Tyse.

157
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:32,437
I do have some concerns.

158
00:12:32,437 --> 00:12:34,110
- Please, continues.

159
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:37,210
- The long time in space is
taking its toll on the crew

160
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:38,780
and on me.

161
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:40,700
We're also down to our
last destroyer missile

162
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:43,490
and after we nuke another black hole,

163
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:46,133
we will be out of armaments.

164
00:12:46,133 --> 00:12:49,130
- Then I see no reason why
you can't return to Aquarius

165
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:52,110
for an extended break and a bonus.

166
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:53,120
- You are too kind, Madam Tyse,

167
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:58,120
- It's the least we can
do, and drinks at my tower

168
00:12:58,250 --> 00:12:59,597
once you land?

169
00:12:59,597 --> 00:13:03,010
- That might go against
corporation policy.

170
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:05,123
- Not when I'm calling shots, Captain.

171
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:10,870
- I might be able to manage
some time on reentry.

172
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:12,850
- That's what I like about you, Captain.

173
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:15,593
You're always so accommodating.

174
00:13:20,091 --> 00:13:23,174
(upbeat tense music)

175
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,840
- Damn, would you get a load of that?

176
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,090
That's the largest black
hole I've ever seen.

177
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:34,973
- By my calculations the
largest one on record.

178
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:38,313
- Either way Jacowitz's warhead imploded.

179
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,393
Hey Jacowitz, check out your monitor.

180
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:49,230
- I see it, but I don't believe my eyes.

181
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:51,980
I can't wait to shove this
bomb buster down its throat.

182
00:13:53,048 --> 00:13:53,881
(beeping sound)

183
00:13:53,881 --> 00:13:56,530
- Hey Captain, you better
to get to the bridge.

184
00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:58,930
Looks like we can finally
dust off this missile.

185
00:14:02,054 --> 00:14:05,137
(upbeat tense music)

186
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,340
- What is it, guys?

187
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:10,373
- Look at that.

188
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:12,520
- [Captain Halstead] She's a beauty.

189
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,353
- [Maitland] You ain't kidding.

190
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:14,966
Shall we nuke it now?

191
00:14:14,966 --> 00:14:16,720
- [Captain Halstead] Why not?

192
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:21,633
Jacowitz, lock your coordinates
on 2517, full thrust.

193
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:25,530
- Locked and ready.

194
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:26,563
Awaiting your order.

195
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:28,723
- On my command.

196
00:14:28,723 --> 00:14:33,450
In five, four, three, two.

197
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:35,723
- Captain, recall the launch.

198
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,780
- Why?

199
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:42,680
- There's something else out there.

200
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,520
- Your circuits are fried.

201
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:47,167
- Bringing it up on the main monitor now.

202
00:14:48,452 --> 00:14:51,869
(eerie electronic music)

203
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:04,670
- Cancel the launch.

204
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:05,563
We have an issue.

205
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,073
- Yes, sir.

206
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:12,100
- Why is that?

207
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:15,950
Space debris from some
kind of derelict ship?

208
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:20,950
- My scans show no known
vessel in the Aquarius quadrant

209
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:22,333
it could belong to.

210
00:15:23,447 --> 00:15:26,000
- I've never seen anything like it.

211
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,753
Vox, scan it for any form
of life, even bodies.

212
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,293
- Yes, sir.

213
00:15:33,746 --> 00:15:36,413
(beeping noise)

214
00:15:43,222 --> 00:15:44,472
- Are you okay?

215
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,103
- I don't know, something
about that object

216
00:15:50,103 --> 00:15:52,223
it just gives me a scared feeling.

217
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:58,300
- Vox, any info on its origin?

218
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:02,560
- Captain, it is made of
a plant-based material

219
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:06,327
processed and compressed, some metal and-

220
00:16:08,156 --> 00:16:09,560
- And?

221
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,853
- some type of life form.

222
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:16,683
- Nothing could survive
in that, whatever that is.

223
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:20,550
- That's what my bio scan states.

224
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:22,440
There's something else.

225
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,533
A high energy field.

226
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:29,030
- It's probably coming
from the black hole.

227
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:30,724
- No, something else.

228
00:16:30,724 --> 00:16:33,060
(buzzing sound)

229
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:34,910
- [Maitland] What was that?

230
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:37,130
- Energy shock wave.

231
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:37,963
- From what, Vox?

232
00:16:37,963 --> 00:16:39,163
- From that.

233
00:16:44,486 --> 00:16:46,986
(eerie sound)

234
00:16:48,624 --> 00:16:51,010
- Well, this is turning
into a wonderful day.

235
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,333
Derelict ships and space symbols.

236
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,170
- You know, I had a
friend that had a tattoo.

237
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:58,054
It looked just like that.

238
00:16:58,054 --> 00:17:02,740
- Database scan shows
it is an ancient symbol

239
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:06,273
representing evil, a pentagram.

240
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:11,420
- Space law dictates we have
to investigate the derelict.

241
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:13,200
We can't blow up a black hole

242
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:16,640
unless we rescue any survivors,

243
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,777
find out exactly what that is.

244
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:22,280
- I'll ready the med lab.

245
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:25,370
- I'll volunteer, Captain.

246
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:28,080
I can't do much till we clear this up.

247
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:28,913
- I need you here

248
00:17:28,913 --> 00:17:31,010
in case we have to launch
a retaliatory strike

249
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:32,443
against the pentagram.

250
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:35,700
Change your coordinates and lock in on it.

251
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,050
- You think it's dangerous?

252
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:41,250
- Could be a space anomaly,
but let's just be safe.

253
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:44,520
- Send Vox, I mean, if there's
something sinister on board,

254
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:47,070
he's easy to repair if we're attacked.

255
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:49,390
- Thank you for your concern.

256
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:51,330
- Sure thing, Vox.

257
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:53,160
- Vox, get down to the transport.

258
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:56,170
Maitland lock in on the object's
coordinates for transfer.

259
00:17:56,170 --> 00:17:57,730
- Sure thing, Captain.

260
00:17:57,730 --> 00:17:59,740
- Vox, let me know when you're prepped.

261
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:01,453
- Yes, Captain Halstead.

262
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:06,760
(mechanical whirring noise)

263
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,270
- I thought we were going home.

264
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:09,640
- What was that?

265
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,473
- Oh, nothing.

266
00:18:10,473 --> 00:18:11,947
Just thinking out loud.

267
00:18:11,947 --> 00:18:14,947
(suspenseful music)

268
00:18:33,032 --> 00:18:36,532
- Whatever you are, I sense your presence.

269
00:18:44,868 --> 00:18:47,258
(gasping)
(upbeat tense music)

270
00:18:47,258 --> 00:18:50,258
(suspenseful music)

271
00:19:03,856 --> 00:19:05,914
(Nurmi screaming)

272
00:19:05,914 --> 00:19:10,914
(eerie electronic music)
(grunting sound)

273
00:19:16,202 --> 00:19:17,563
- What was that?

274
00:19:17,563 --> 00:19:20,563
(suspenseful music)

275
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:27,307
(mechanical whirring)

276
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:33,570
- I am ready, Captain.

277
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,058
- All right, transfer beginning now.

278
00:19:38,058 --> 00:19:41,141
(high pitched sound)

279
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:45,600
- Transfer in progress.

280
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,080
I wonder what he'll find.

281
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,163
- Hopefully, nothing.

282
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:51,100
Make sure his onboard camera is on screen

283
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,650
and recording for the duration.

284
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:54,700
- Oh, you're just in time.

285
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,290
Show's about to begin.

286
00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:58,040
Vox should be on board momentarily.

287
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:00,293
- Halstead,

288
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:07,990
I just felt a presence in the halls

289
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:09,560
where I saw nothing,

290
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:13,060
and then in the med lab,
I was- I was attacked

291
00:20:15,861 --> 00:20:17,157
by a tentacle monster.

292
00:20:17,157 --> 00:20:21,127
It was strange and then it was just gone.

293
00:20:21,127 --> 00:20:22,766
- What?

294
00:20:22,766 --> 00:20:25,670
The spooky stuff must be
getting on your nerves.

295
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:27,893
Let's figure this out one step at a time.

296
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:30,410
- Sure.

297
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:34,031
- Transfer in three, two, one, complete.

298
00:20:34,031 --> 00:20:37,114
(high pitched sound)

299
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:44,773
- Onboard and safe.

300
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50,730
- Pan the camera around
so we can get a good look.

301
00:20:51,902 --> 00:20:54,485
(static sound)

302
00:21:00,184 --> 00:21:02,615
- That's not a space ship.

303
00:21:02,615 --> 00:21:06,433
- That looks like a- a
primitive living quarters.

304
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:10,110
- Are your readings picking anything up?

305
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:11,703
- Yes, oxygen.

306
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:15,330
- That's impossible.

307
00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:17,470
You need to be re-calibrated, Vox.

308
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:19,730
- That's what my sensors are reading.

309
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:22,293
I am not programmed to exaggerate.

310
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:24,700
- That's enough, both of you.

311
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,790
Vox, keep exploring.

312
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:29,890
We're watching you on the monitor.

313
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:30,950
- Yes, sir.

314
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:33,950
(suspenseful music)

315
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:38,795
(static sound)

316
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:47,150
(suspenseful music)

317
00:21:53,385 --> 00:21:55,999
(static sound)

318
00:21:55,999 --> 00:21:58,999
(suspenseful music)

319
00:22:09,391 --> 00:22:11,974
(static sound)

320
00:22:32,831 --> 00:22:35,700
(grunting)

321
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:36,793
Identify yourself.

322
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:40,866
- Say that again, Vox?

323
00:22:40,866 --> 00:22:42,620
Did you say "identify yourself"?

324
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:47,620
- Affirmative, humanoid figure
standing two meters away.

325
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:50,770
- We see nothing on the monitor.

326
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:51,983
Must be a malfunction.

327
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:53,873
- Negative.

328
00:22:55,931 --> 00:22:59,260
- What is this place?

329
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:02,963
- You are in Aquarius system, Regula.

330
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:06,050
- He's malfunctioning.

331
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:08,763
- Space pressure must be
affecting his sensors.

332
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:12,469
- Vox, with whom are you conversing?

333
00:23:12,469 --> 00:23:15,180
- Unidentified humanoid.

334
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:16,903
What is your name?

335
00:23:18,307 --> 00:23:19,640
- We are Legion.

336
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:23,008
- Legion?

337
00:23:23,008 --> 00:23:24,443
Does not compute.

338
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:29,260
- Vox, we still can't see
who you are conversing with.

339
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:30,233
Please describe.

340
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:33,933
- Tall, dark, garbed in black.

341
00:23:36,231 --> 00:23:39,479
(electrical sound)

342
00:23:39,479 --> 00:23:41,969
(static sound)

343
00:23:41,969 --> 00:23:43,133
- Vox.

344
00:23:43,133 --> 00:23:45,450
Vox, your image capture is damaged.

345
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:46,420
What's going on?

346
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:47,253
Vox.

347
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,530
- We lost him.

348
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:53,380
I'm not even getting a sensor
reading from his functions.

349
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:57,300
- Looks like we're going
on a rescue mission.

350
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:58,530
- Are you kidding?

351
00:23:58,530 --> 00:23:59,510
He's not one of us.

352
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:00,690
He's a bot.

353
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:03,460
Let's just blow that
structure outta the stars.

354
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:05,440
- Vox is one of us.

355
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,770
Maitland, you stay at the
helm to transport us there

356
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:08,800
and back.

357
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,090
Jacowitz, stay at the ready

358
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:12,420
in case we have to nuke all this madness.

359
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:13,570
- Yes, sir.

360
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:14,433
Sure, Captain.

361
00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:17,087
- Let's go, Nurmi.

362
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:22,743
(upbeat tense music)

363
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:45,989
- Transport three, two, one, activate.

364
00:24:45,989 --> 00:24:47,150
(beeping sound)

365
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:50,233
(high pitched sound)

366
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:57,140
- I've got a bad feeling about this.

367
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:59,108
- You have a bad feeling about everything.

368
00:24:59,108 --> 00:25:02,191
(high pitched sound)

369
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:06,613
- Are you okay?

370
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:08,393
- Affirmative.

371
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:12,833
- Maitland, we made it
stay put and stay frosty.

372
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:16,093
- I'm at the ready, good luck.

373
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:27,603
- This place, so strange.

374
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:33,204
- But what a view.

375
00:25:33,204 --> 00:25:36,287
(upbeat tense music)

376
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:26,050
- Not very comfortable.

377
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,472
- Check out this monitor.

378
00:26:29,472 --> 00:26:34,472
(Halstead laughing)
(Nurmi laughing)

379
00:26:35,059 --> 00:26:35,892
(Nurmi clearing throat)

380
00:26:35,892 --> 00:26:38,975
(upbeat tense music)

381
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:10,870
- This looks like a nutrition center.

382
00:27:12,943 --> 00:27:16,026
We use this in the ship of some kind.

383
00:27:17,452 --> 00:27:20,083
(gasping)

384
00:27:20,083 --> 00:27:20,916
- What?

385
00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:25,756
- I thought I saw hand scuttle that way.

386
00:27:25,756 --> 00:27:28,839
(upbeat tense music)

387
00:27:53,044 --> 00:27:53,961
Poor thing.

388
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:57,470
What could have done
something like this to him?

389
00:27:57,470 --> 00:27:59,083
- Well, he didn't disintegrate.

390
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:03,910
There's no electrical residue on him.

391
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:07,798
Looks like something tore him to pieces.

392
00:28:07,798 --> 00:28:10,298
(eerie sound)

393
00:28:15,608 --> 00:28:17,108
What is it, Nurmi?

394
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:21,433
Nurmi, Nurmi.

395
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,433
Answer me.

396
00:28:30,530 --> 00:28:31,473
That's an order.

397
00:28:33,247 --> 00:28:36,330
(tense upbeat music)

398
00:28:58,812 --> 00:28:59,645
Nurmi.

399
00:29:09,395 --> 00:29:10,424
- In there.

400
00:29:10,424 --> 00:29:13,507
(tense upbeat music)

401
00:29:31,523 --> 00:29:34,305
(Nurmi gasping for air)

402
00:29:34,305 --> 00:29:35,138
- Calm down.

403
00:29:35,138 --> 00:29:36,173
It's okay, you're all right.

404
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:38,850
- What happened?

405
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:39,693
Who is he?

406
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,680
- Don't you remember?

407
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,380
You walked up here, you found him.

408
00:29:45,401 --> 00:29:50,401
- I remember leaning over
Vox and then I woke up here.

409
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:56,023
- Strange, very strange.

410
00:29:57,810 --> 00:29:59,150
Maitland, transport us back.

411
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:00,690
We're bringing a guest.

412
00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:01,523
- What?

413
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:03,950
- You heard me.

414
00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:05,963
We found a humanoid, Vox is gone.

415
00:30:07,724 --> 00:30:10,807
(high pitched sound)

416
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:20,520
- Well?

417
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,670
- Well what?

418
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:22,503
- Is he dead?

419
00:30:24,970 --> 00:30:27,003
- No, not quite.

420
00:30:28,090 --> 00:30:31,253
I'm getting life signals,
but nothing definitive.

421
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:37,890
- I think he holds the
key to all this craziness.

422
00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:39,190
- What makes you say that?

423
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:41,763
- Just a hunch.

424
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:46,600
- I could be wrong, but it
would seem that he's in a state

425
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,023
of suspended animation.

426
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:54,180
- Keep me updated on his progress.

427
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:55,140
- Yeah, I will.

428
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:56,240
I'll keep an eye on him.

429
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,073
- Thanks.

430
00:30:57,073 --> 00:30:58,870
I have to report this to Madam Tyse.

431
00:31:05,928 --> 00:31:09,200
(eerie sound)

432
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:14,200
- A giant black hole, a fiery
pentagram, a strange craft

433
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:17,593
and a derelict humanoid
in suspended animation?

434
00:31:19,290 --> 00:31:21,223
Captain, you've had a hell of a day.

435
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:25,050
Are you sure you're not
to avoid coming back

436
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:26,350
so you can break our date?

437
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:29,410
- Trust me, that's not the case.

438
00:31:29,410 --> 00:31:32,670
We've never come across anything
like this in space before.

439
00:31:32,670 --> 00:31:36,290
All this, it can't be a coincidence.

440
00:31:36,290 --> 00:31:38,830
Madam Tyse, I think there's
something more sinister

441
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:40,280
at play here.

442
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:42,610
- Do you think you're in danger?

443
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:43,890
- I'm not sure.

444
00:31:43,890 --> 00:31:45,500
It's just a feeling.

445
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:48,693
- We can't operate on
feelings, Captain, only facts.

446
00:31:49,610 --> 00:31:52,260
Send me all the data you
have on the abnormalities

447
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:54,713
and we'll run a check to
see if we find anything.

448
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,240
- Yes, Madam Tyse.

449
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,700
- In the meantime, sit tight.

450
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:01,340
Black hole, the pentagram,

451
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:03,220
and the derelict ship
aren't going anywhere

452
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:05,030
anytime soon.

453
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:07,683
Report back to me if you
have any new information.

454
00:32:07,683 --> 00:32:08,912
Tyse out.

455
00:32:08,912 --> 00:32:11,579
(beeping sound)

456
00:32:13,261 --> 00:32:15,761
(eerie sound)

457
00:32:23,278 --> 00:32:25,778
(tense music)

458
00:32:29,288 --> 00:32:30,863
(Nurmi screaming)

459
00:32:30,863 --> 00:32:31,696
- No.

460
00:32:34,411 --> 00:32:36,244
No, in God's name, no.

461
00:32:38,603 --> 00:32:42,097
(Nurmi coughing)

462
00:32:42,097 --> 00:32:44,730
- Halstead, we have an emergency.

463
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:45,563
- What is it?

464
00:32:46,401 --> 00:32:48,668
- The humanoid has escaped.

465
00:32:48,668 --> 00:32:50,111
He's loose on the ship.

466
00:32:50,111 --> 00:32:52,282
(alarm going off)

467
00:32:52,282 --> 00:32:54,782
(eerie sound)

468
00:32:55,958 --> 00:32:58,458
(tense music)

469
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:21,220
- Hey pal, what do you think you're doing?

470
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:22,333
Who the hell are you?

471
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:23,211
Whoa.

472
00:33:23,211 --> 00:33:26,044
(alarm going off)

473
00:33:28,588 --> 00:33:31,338
(blaster firing)

474
00:33:32,814 --> 00:33:33,647
(machine beeping)

475
00:33:33,647 --> 00:33:35,400
All right, I stopped it.

476
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,373
- You okay?

477
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:40,260
- Ye- yeah, damn, how did he
even know the launch sequence?

478
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:44,410
Well, someone better
keep a better eye on him

479
00:33:44,410 --> 00:33:46,355
or we're all gonna end up atomized.

480
00:33:46,355 --> 00:33:49,438
(upbeat tense music)

481
00:34:24,209 --> 00:34:28,292
- There are so many other
places to rule unheard.

482
00:34:38,850 --> 00:34:40,883
- I'm sorry for the trouble I caused.

483
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:43,630
Where am I?

484
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:45,860
- We'll ask the questions, thank you.

485
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:47,490
- They better be the right answers

486
00:34:47,490 --> 00:34:50,750
or I'm going to melt your face
off with this laser pistol.

487
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:52,430
- Easy, Maitland.

488
00:34:52,430 --> 00:34:54,630
Why don't you and
Jacowitz get back on duty?

489
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:58,450
- What, we can't
interrogate this fool too?

490
00:34:58,450 --> 00:35:00,110
- That's a Captain's job.

491
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:00,943
Beat it.

492
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:02,863
- Sure, Captain.

493
00:35:11,330 --> 00:35:12,730
- You tried to kill an officer

494
00:35:12,730 --> 00:35:15,790
and launch a warhead at the
structure we found you in.

495
00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:18,763
That's punishable by death
in several star systems.

496
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:22,660
- Star systems?

497
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:23,643
I'm from earth.

498
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:25,873
- Earth.

499
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:30,800
That was, uh, that was
in the prime galaxies.

500
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:34,433
It was destroyed by an imploding
sun, hundreds of years ago.

501
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:39,333
- That's simply not possible.

502
00:35:40,770 --> 00:35:43,030
I am Father Benna from earth.

503
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:44,470
The year 2021.

504
00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:47,470
(suspenseful music)

505
00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:54,480
- The year is 3015.

506
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:59,000
You are millions of light
years away from the location

507
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,373
that Earth once was.

508
00:36:03,490 --> 00:36:07,923
We found you on the structure
and we brought you here.

509
00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:10,810
- Start from the beginning.

510
00:36:10,810 --> 00:36:12,580
You said your name's Father Benna.

511
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:13,530
What title is that?

512
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:20,503
- A priest, a holy person, a man of God.

513
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:25,330
- Part of the ancient religions,

514
00:36:25,330 --> 00:36:28,060
believing in a one true God, heaven, hell.

515
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:29,123
That sort of thing.

516
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:33,013
- We are going to need God's help,

517
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:37,523
even here in the outer reaches of space.

518
00:36:38,770 --> 00:36:39,720
- Be more specific.

519
00:36:43,210 --> 00:36:47,503
- The place you found me,
it's a house, not a spaceship.

520
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,020
You see on earth,

521
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:52,833
an evil destructive
force plagued the earth.

522
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:55,443
It was my mission to defeat it.

523
00:36:56,490 --> 00:36:58,423
That house was the epicenter.

524
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:02,073
I made one last ditch effort to stop it.

525
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:06,143
The evil took my hand.

526
00:37:07,970 --> 00:37:10,350
I begged God to assist

527
00:37:10,350 --> 00:37:12,923
and we were suddenly
whisked into the heavens.

528
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,283
We ended up here.

529
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:17,413
- Ravings of a lunatic.

530
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:22,890
- Believe what you want,
but we are in great danger.

531
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:24,623
The signs are already here.

532
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:27,390
- The signs.

533
00:37:27,390 --> 00:37:30,636
The signs in the stars
like that pentagram?

534
00:37:30,636 --> 00:37:31,734
- Yes, yes.

535
00:37:31,734 --> 00:37:34,020
- And the presence on the ship.

536
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:35,090
- What presence?

537
00:37:35,090 --> 00:37:36,183
- Stand down.

538
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:40,083
- All right, I'm sorry.

539
00:37:43,604 --> 00:37:45,354
But if what you say, Miss, is true.

540
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:47,960
It's already beginning again.

541
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:50,000
- What, what is beginning?

542
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,330
- The destruction of you

543
00:37:51,330 --> 00:37:53,723
and everything in your known galaxies.

544
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:57,630
It won't stop until it destroys everything

545
00:37:57,630 --> 00:37:59,233
with its vile touch.

546
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,584
- What if he says is true?

547
00:38:06,584 --> 00:38:09,143
- You don't actually believe
his nonsense, do you?

548
00:38:10,083 --> 00:38:12,680
- I'm just saying there's
something going on here

549
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:13,950
we know nothing about.

550
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:16,913
That house, the pentagram.

551
00:38:18,650 --> 00:38:20,460
Its- there's something happening.

552
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:23,180
W- why can't it be evil?

553
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:25,430
- 20th century fairy tales.

554
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:28,170
What's going on is a
series of coincidences

555
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:30,253
that we'll figure out in a logical way.

556
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:34,400
Meanwhile, Father Benna,

557
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,352
we're going to lock
you up for safekeeping.

558
00:38:37,352 --> 00:38:40,352
(suspenseful music)

559
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:49,990
Sit tight for a while.

560
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:53,800
Someone will bring you
nourishment later and behave.

561
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,323
I wouldn't want to jettison
you out into space.

562
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:04,720
- So it begins again.

563
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,383
This time I'll finish it.

564
00:39:08,490 --> 00:39:09,900
- How is he?

565
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:11,563
- Resting in his detainment cell.

566
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:15,330
- We're gonna need his help.

567
00:39:15,330 --> 00:39:16,163
You know that.

568
00:39:19,250 --> 00:39:20,950
Just hope he's willing to give it.

569
00:39:22,327 --> 00:39:24,283
- I'm not sure of anything anymore.

570
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:29,380
All of us, including you have
been on a 48 hour rotation.

571
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:30,343
We need rest.

572
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:34,470
In Vox's absence we'll
take turns on the bridge.

573
00:39:36,882 --> 00:39:39,632
(Nurmi laughing)

574
00:39:40,810 --> 00:39:41,810
- Are we going home?

575
00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:50,533
- Sure, we are.

576
00:39:50,533 --> 00:39:53,366
(slow calm music)

577
00:39:56,364 --> 00:40:01,364
(eerie sounds)
(suspenseful music)

578
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,320
- Hello, Halstead.

579
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,783
What is your progress rep...

580
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:57,090
You're not Halstead.

581
00:40:57,090 --> 00:40:57,977
Who are you?

582
00:41:00,179 --> 00:41:05,179
(electrical sounds)
(Madam Tyse choking)

583
00:41:06,258 --> 00:41:08,758
(eerie sound)

584
00:41:13,544 --> 00:41:16,211
- A new vessel in the new world.

585
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:20,523
(upbeat tense music)

586
00:41:40,472 --> 00:41:45,329
- What the fu-
(mid pitched humming sound)

587
00:41:45,329 --> 00:41:48,246
(Maitland gasping)

588
00:41:49,206 --> 00:41:50,539
- W- Where am I?

589
00:41:54,637 --> 00:41:55,470
Who are you?

590
00:41:55,470 --> 00:41:56,667
How did I get here?

591
00:41:56,667 --> 00:41:59,584
(Maitland gasping)

592
00:42:02,487 --> 00:42:04,904
(indistinct)

593
00:42:06,371 --> 00:42:07,905
- Let me go.

594
00:42:07,905 --> 00:42:09,435
- I will not restrain you.

595
00:42:09,435 --> 00:42:10,268
- No.

596
00:42:10,268 --> 00:42:13,015
(Maitland screaming)
(crunching noise)

597
00:42:13,015 --> 00:42:14,918
No, make it stop.

598
00:42:14,918 --> 00:42:19,918
(crunching noise)
(Maitland gasping)

599
00:42:31,881 --> 00:42:33,048
What the fuck.

600
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:36,993
(gasping for air)

601
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:44,183
(eerie sounds)

602
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:13,073
- Hello?

603
00:43:15,190 --> 00:43:16,140
Where is everybody?

604
00:43:17,841 --> 00:43:19,327
I don't know how I got here.

605
00:43:19,327 --> 00:43:21,910
(eerie sounds)

606
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:24,170
You stay away.

607
00:43:24,170 --> 00:43:25,710
You're crazy.

608
00:43:25,710 --> 00:43:26,910
- I only need your help.

609
00:43:28,420 --> 00:43:30,163
I seem to have misplaced my hand.

610
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:33,294
It's painful, you know.

611
00:43:33,294 --> 00:43:35,877
(eerie sounds)

612
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:41,620
- Damn you, die already.
(blaster firing)

613
00:43:49,363 --> 00:43:51,571
No, get it off me.

614
00:43:51,571 --> 00:43:52,738
Get it off me.

615
00:43:55,712 --> 00:43:57,295
- Suicide is a sin.

616
00:43:58,951 --> 00:44:03,515
(Father Benna laughing)
- Get it off me.

617
00:44:03,515 --> 00:44:07,033
(blaster firing)

618
00:44:07,033 --> 00:44:10,366
- What the- what the hell just happened?

619
00:44:19,562 --> 00:44:22,145
(eerie sounds)

620
00:44:32,453 --> 00:44:35,370
(thunder clapping)

621
00:44:40,332 --> 00:44:43,165
(Nurmi screaming)

622
00:44:44,332 --> 00:44:47,415
- Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

623
00:44:49,987 --> 00:44:52,570
(eerie sounds)

624
00:44:56,267 --> 00:44:59,387
(Nurmi gasping)

625
00:44:59,387 --> 00:45:00,513
What are you doing?

626
00:45:00,513 --> 00:45:02,061
Let go go.

627
00:45:02,061 --> 00:45:04,014
- Welcome to hell.

628
00:45:04,014 --> 00:45:07,597
I think someone has a
doctor's appointment.

629
00:45:10,051 --> 00:45:12,311
- [Nurmi] Please, stop this.

630
00:45:12,311 --> 00:45:14,228
No, what are you doing?

631
00:45:16,553 --> 00:45:19,386
(Nurmi screaming)

632
00:45:20,361 --> 00:45:21,194
Wh- why?

633
00:45:23,169 --> 00:45:24,002
Why?

634
00:45:28,572 --> 00:45:30,239
- Because I want to.

635
00:45:33,572 --> 00:45:34,634
(crunching noise)

636
00:45:34,634 --> 00:45:37,301
(Nurmi gasping)

637
00:45:45,917 --> 00:45:48,500
(Nurmi crying)

638
00:45:56,530 --> 00:45:57,363
- No.

639
00:45:58,670 --> 00:45:59,513
Stay away.

640
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:01,293
Stay away.

641
00:46:01,293 --> 00:46:03,750
(eerie sound)

642
00:46:06,715 --> 00:46:08,723
No, no, stay away.

643
00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:10,923
Stay away.

644
00:46:13,460 --> 00:46:15,073
Stay away.

645
00:46:15,073 --> 00:46:16,301
Stay away.

646
00:46:16,301 --> 00:46:18,801
(eerie sound)

647
00:46:38,740 --> 00:46:41,657
(thunder clapping)

648
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:49,333
- What?

649
00:46:55,135 --> 00:46:56,702
How did I get here?

650
00:46:56,702 --> 00:46:59,702
(suspenseful music)

651
00:47:16,183 --> 00:47:18,683
(eerie sound)

652
00:47:27,803 --> 00:47:29,542
What the hell?

653
00:47:29,542 --> 00:47:30,875
- Exactly, hell.

654
00:47:34,062 --> 00:47:35,505
- Who are you?

655
00:47:35,505 --> 00:47:40,505
- I go by many names, none
of which you would recognize.

656
00:47:40,949 --> 00:47:43,532
I am, shall we say, malevolent.

657
00:47:45,766 --> 00:47:50,144
What that little man,
Benna, has told you is true.

658
00:47:50,144 --> 00:47:52,598
He is a warrior of the light

659
00:47:52,598 --> 00:47:55,194
but even in his finest hour,

660
00:47:55,194 --> 00:47:59,473
his light could not pierce
the darkness that I bore.

661
00:47:59,473 --> 00:48:04,038
His own God forsake him
and banished us both here.

662
00:48:04,038 --> 00:48:06,038
Somewhere far, far away.

663
00:48:07,173 --> 00:48:10,814
A place where God has
no meaning or purpose.

664
00:48:10,814 --> 00:48:13,231
All the more for evil to win.

665
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:17,420
- But there is goodness.

666
00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:19,086
That is light.

667
00:48:19,086 --> 00:48:21,529
- That is simply not enough.

668
00:48:21,529 --> 00:48:23,641
Hundreds of years have past,

669
00:48:23,641 --> 00:48:26,862
but it was a mere blink of an eye for me.

670
00:48:26,862 --> 00:48:29,945
I have been alive since the creation.

671
00:48:30,882 --> 00:48:32,465
- Creation of what?

672
00:48:34,365 --> 00:48:36,278
- Of everything.

673
00:48:36,278 --> 00:48:39,413
I sat on the right side of the creator.

674
00:48:39,413 --> 00:48:41,537
I watched it all.

675
00:48:41,537 --> 00:48:44,704
All the air, all the new, all he rule.

676
00:48:46,729 --> 00:48:49,285
He banished me to dark place

677
00:48:49,285 --> 00:48:53,535
and since then we wage war
in humans for our cause.

678
00:48:55,137 --> 00:48:59,020
Do you like to play
games, Captain Halstead?

679
00:48:59,020 --> 00:49:02,853
- No, especially when
others' lives are at risk.

680
00:49:03,876 --> 00:49:08,184
- Right now, you only need
worry about your own life.

681
00:49:08,184 --> 00:49:10,434
(grunting)

682
00:49:13,065 --> 00:49:15,334
(Halstead groaning)

683
00:49:15,334 --> 00:49:16,917
- No, it's burning.

684
00:49:19,180 --> 00:49:22,180
(suspenseful music)

685
00:49:50,410 --> 00:49:51,363
- We meet again.

686
00:49:52,340 --> 00:49:53,444
- Yes.

687
00:49:53,444 --> 00:49:56,970
I'm afraid it's over for you,
but you are a worthy opponent.

688
00:49:58,990 --> 00:50:00,820
- It is not over.

689
00:50:00,820 --> 00:50:02,710
It is never over.

690
00:50:02,710 --> 00:50:07,210
The war between good and
evil continues here, now.

691
00:50:08,780 --> 00:50:10,584
We are proof of that.

692
00:50:10,584 --> 00:50:12,161
- Think about it, Benna.

693
00:50:12,161 --> 00:50:14,027
Your world is gone.

694
00:50:14,027 --> 00:50:16,116
Your faith is gone.

695
00:50:16,116 --> 00:50:18,328
Your God is gone.

696
00:50:18,328 --> 00:50:22,911
In this place, it does not
exist, therefore it is over.

697
00:50:24,197 --> 00:50:27,216
- And I suppose that it's your plan?

698
00:50:27,216 --> 00:50:28,820
- Plan?

699
00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:31,820
My dear Benna, what do you refer to?

700
00:50:33,130 --> 00:50:35,480
- You know what I'm talking about.

701
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:40,008
I know you see this new world
as a place to reign supreme.

702
00:50:40,008 --> 00:50:43,360
- Yes, it did cross my mind.

703
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:46,107
These people are like your kind eons ago.

704
00:50:47,237 --> 00:50:50,904
Weak, without belief,
easily led like sheep.

705
00:50:53,210 --> 00:50:55,210
- I won't let you do that.

706
00:50:55,210 --> 00:50:58,060
Not here, not now.

707
00:50:58,060 --> 00:51:00,172
- No one believes in you.

708
00:51:00,172 --> 00:51:02,080
The fight is over.

709
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:05,183
Join me, you can sit on my right side.

710
00:51:07,432 --> 00:51:09,432
Wouldn't that be ironic?

711
00:51:10,770 --> 00:51:14,726
- Never, never in
eternity would I do that.

712
00:51:14,726 --> 00:51:17,992
- Eternity is all I have, Benna.

713
00:51:17,992 --> 00:51:19,520
What do you have?

714
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:23,262
A mere 30 years left if you are lucky.

715
00:51:23,262 --> 00:51:28,179
You won't be around to witness
my conquering of the cosmos.

716
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:32,865
- Then all hope is lost.

717
00:51:32,865 --> 00:51:34,910
(Legion laughing)

718
00:51:34,910 --> 00:51:38,327
- Now you see the light, no pun intended.

719
00:51:39,428 --> 00:51:42,428
(suspenseful music)

720
00:51:49,620 --> 00:51:52,760
- The pentagram, what does that mean

721
00:51:54,010 --> 00:51:58,260
here, now, in this time?

722
00:51:58,260 --> 00:52:01,770
- It is a sign to those
who are already receptive

723
00:52:01,770 --> 00:52:03,647
to a whole new change.

724
00:52:04,554 --> 00:52:08,558
This was foretold in a
different book than your Bible.

725
00:52:08,558 --> 00:52:11,761
A black prophesy for these times.

726
00:52:11,761 --> 00:52:13,737
All will speak of the glowing red star

727
00:52:13,737 --> 00:52:17,097
that ushered in a cosmic
change for all time.

728
00:52:22,286 --> 00:52:27,003
Your cross, your pious symbol,
is gone with your hand.

729
00:52:35,860 --> 00:52:39,593
- Oh Lord, why have you forsaken me?

730
00:52:40,971 --> 00:52:44,283
(Legion laughing)

731
00:52:44,283 --> 00:52:46,720
(computer beeping)

732
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:49,583
- Captain Halstead, you look distraught.

733
00:52:49,583 --> 00:52:51,700
Is there a problem?

734
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:54,000
- Some very strange
things are happening here.

735
00:52:56,010 --> 00:52:57,780
I think the person we
found in the derelict

736
00:52:57,780 --> 00:52:59,900
may be a harbinger of evil.

737
00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:01,350
- What?

738
00:53:01,350 --> 00:53:03,530
Do you need to be
relieved of your command?

739
00:53:03,530 --> 00:53:05,420
What nonsense is this?

740
00:53:05,420 --> 00:53:06,410
Explain.

741
00:53:06,410 --> 00:53:08,220
- I can't, not yet.

742
00:53:08,220 --> 00:53:09,430
I'm putting the pieces together.

743
00:53:09,430 --> 00:53:10,860
Give me some time.

744
00:53:10,860 --> 00:53:13,223
- I'm afraid time is
something you don't have.

745
00:53:14,490 --> 00:53:16,210
- What's that supposed to mean?

746
00:53:16,210 --> 00:53:17,780
- I spoke with the high council

747
00:53:17,780 --> 00:53:20,320
after you sent the
information on the derelict.

748
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:23,420
You are to tow it back
to Aquarius immediately.

749
00:53:23,420 --> 00:53:24,680
- What?

750
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:25,670
What for?

751
00:53:25,670 --> 00:53:28,360
- Because they feel it
is of some significance

752
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:31,660
and should be studied
by our learned elders.

753
00:53:31,660 --> 00:53:33,580
- No, that's a mistake.

754
00:53:33,580 --> 00:53:35,260
I think we should shove
it into the black hole

755
00:53:35,260 --> 00:53:36,860
and obliterate them both.

756
00:53:36,860 --> 00:53:38,330
- You'll do no such thing.

757
00:53:38,330 --> 00:53:40,780
You'll bring it back to
Aquarius as requested

758
00:53:40,780 --> 00:53:43,120
and forget about the black hole for now.

759
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:45,570
It poses no immediate threat.

760
00:53:45,570 --> 00:53:47,950
- And the pentagram, what
do the elders think of that?

761
00:53:47,950 --> 00:53:49,600
- They have determined it is nothing more

762
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:53,053
than a cosmic anomaly and it
will burn itself out soon.

763
00:53:54,060 --> 00:53:56,950
- I disagree with you and
the council on every count.

764
00:53:56,950 --> 00:53:58,300
- I don't care what you think.

765
00:53:58,300 --> 00:53:59,910
If you deviate from your orders,

766
00:53:59,910 --> 00:54:02,730
I have the authority to
blow you from the sky.

767
00:54:02,730 --> 00:54:03,943
Is that clear?

768
00:54:04,940 --> 00:54:06,520
- Very clear.

769
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:09,759
- Good, now get back to work.

770
00:54:09,759 --> 00:54:12,676
(computer beeping)

771
00:54:13,950 --> 00:54:16,200
- Things just keep
getting better and better.

772
00:54:19,690 --> 00:54:21,090
This is Captain Halstead.

773
00:54:21,090 --> 00:54:25,053
I'm calling an emergency meeting
on the bridge immediately.

774
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:29,232
Out.
(computer beeping)

775
00:54:29,232 --> 00:54:31,732
(eerie sound)

776
00:54:38,945 --> 00:54:41,695
(blaster firing)

777
00:54:45,859 --> 00:54:48,600
(blaster firing)

778
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:51,131
(eerie sound)

779
00:54:51,131 --> 00:54:54,131
(suspenseful music)

780
00:55:03,937 --> 00:55:05,020
Come with me.

781
00:55:07,850 --> 00:55:08,683
We need to talk.

782
00:55:13,750 --> 00:55:16,250
(eerie sound)

783
00:55:22,989 --> 00:55:25,600
- Captain, there's some
weird shit going on here.

784
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:27,423
Yeah, weirder than the other shit.

785
00:55:28,350 --> 00:55:30,680
- Why is he out of containment?

786
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:34,373
- Because I believe him and he can help.

787
00:55:35,341 --> 00:55:37,260
- Why the change of heart?

788
00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:39,260
- You've all seen visions.

789
00:55:39,260 --> 00:55:42,460
Hallucinations that
shook you to your core.

790
00:55:42,460 --> 00:55:44,210
- You're not kidding.

791
00:55:44,210 --> 00:55:49,210
- Another thing, Madam Tyse,
she summoned me on the telecom

792
00:55:49,570 --> 00:55:52,203
and she looked different, unnatural.

793
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:54,720
- What did she say?

794
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:56,970
- She wants us to forget
about the black hole

795
00:55:58,040 --> 00:56:01,023
and bring the house and the
derelict ship back to Aquarius.

796
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:03,230
- That bitch is off her rocker.

797
00:56:03,230 --> 00:56:05,400
We need to nuke that black hole.

798
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:08,760
- She has fallen under the
influence of the evil one.

799
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:11,070
That house must be destroyed.

800
00:56:11,070 --> 00:56:12,840
No questions.

801
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:16,080
If not, the evil will
spread across this galaxy

802
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:17,113
like a plague.

803
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:19,930
Don't you see?

804
00:56:19,930 --> 00:56:23,523
The house is its life
source for whatever reason.

805
00:56:24,490 --> 00:56:27,023
- All right, we need to plan.

806
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:30,700
- We can't waste the missile on the house.

807
00:56:30,700 --> 00:56:32,940
- We can destroy the house from within.

808
00:56:32,940 --> 00:56:35,317
Thermal charges planted by us

809
00:56:35,317 --> 00:56:37,900
and then detonated once we transport back.

810
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:40,030
- No, that's too risky.

811
00:56:40,030 --> 00:56:44,060
The evil, once we are at the
house, it'll know we're there.

812
00:56:44,060 --> 00:56:45,050
Then what?

813
00:56:45,050 --> 00:56:47,683
- I can go and act as a deterrent.

814
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:49,930
- Okay.

815
00:56:49,930 --> 00:56:54,930
So we go to the house, we set the charges,

816
00:56:55,160 --> 00:56:57,110
we blow up the house when we get back

817
00:56:57,110 --> 00:56:58,710
and then we nuke the black hole.

818
00:56:59,963 --> 00:57:03,040
- Guess we're not getting
that overtime pay, huh.

819
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:07,330
- Please be warned, the evil
one knows what scares you.

820
00:57:07,330 --> 00:57:10,630
It will use every trick
in its book to stop us.

821
00:57:10,630 --> 00:57:13,343
Deception, doubt and fear are its weapon.

822
00:57:14,890 --> 00:57:16,460
- Right.

823
00:57:16,460 --> 00:57:17,940
Right, well, that's your department.

824
00:57:17,940 --> 00:57:19,890
Just watch our backs.

825
00:57:19,890 --> 00:57:23,490
- Don't worry, we've got a score to settle

826
00:57:23,490 --> 00:57:24,880
and I not finished yet.

827
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:27,250
- Looks like it did a
number on you the last time.

828
00:57:27,250 --> 00:57:28,083
Your hand.

829
00:57:30,070 --> 00:57:35,070
- Oh, yes, well, this
bite is from the soul.

830
00:57:36,830 --> 00:57:39,723
- Remember that when that
vision twist your head off.

831
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:45,531
- All right, let's go.

832
00:57:45,531 --> 00:57:46,364
(computer beeping)

833
00:57:46,364 --> 00:57:48,550
- Captain Halstead, answer immediately.

834
00:57:48,550 --> 00:57:50,580
The council and I need
to have a word with you

835
00:57:50,580 --> 00:57:54,230
to make sure our instructions
are being followed.

836
00:57:54,230 --> 00:57:57,829
- Uh, sorry, we're having
a problem with reception.

837
00:57:57,829 --> 00:57:58,713
(computer beeping)

838
00:57:58,713 --> 00:58:01,796
(upbeat tense music)

839
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:11,110
- Good luck, everyone.

840
00:59:11,110 --> 00:59:12,320
We'll need it.

841
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:15,403
(high pitched noise)

842
00:59:23,890 --> 00:59:27,000
- I guess that's what dying
and crossing over feels like.

843
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,823
- You get used to it
after a few transports.

844
00:59:37,010 --> 00:59:37,843
- Set at 180.

845
00:59:39,401 --> 00:59:40,234
- Mm.

846
00:59:44,317 --> 00:59:46,560
- What is it, Benna?

847
00:59:46,560 --> 00:59:47,960
- I thought I saw something.

848
00:59:51,950 --> 00:59:53,930
Nevermind, it was nothing.

849
00:59:53,930 --> 00:59:55,100
- Stay focused.

850
00:59:55,100 --> 00:59:57,725
We don't need to be wasting
our time chasing ghosts.

851
00:59:57,725 --> 01:00:00,808
(upbeat tense music)

852
01:00:22,274 --> 01:00:24,250
(computer beeping)

853
01:00:24,250 --> 01:00:25,593
- All right, big guy.

854
01:00:26,930 --> 01:00:30,800
Ready to kick another
black hole in the ass?

855
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:32,550
- Where is Captain Halsted?

856
01:00:32,550 --> 01:00:34,640
I need to speak with him immediately.

857
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:37,230
I am sending a detachment to your vessels

858
01:00:37,230 --> 01:00:38,770
to take over operations.

859
01:00:38,770 --> 01:00:41,493
You and your crew are to stand down.

860
01:00:42,700 --> 01:00:44,247
- But he's a- already..

861
01:00:45,510 --> 01:00:47,423
- He's doing what?

862
01:00:48,544 --> 01:00:51,630
- I- I, um...

863
01:00:51,630 --> 01:00:53,480
- Stop stalling.

864
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:55,450
- He- he's...

865
01:00:56,620 --> 01:00:57,453
- Yes?

866
01:00:58,700 --> 01:01:01,030
- He's preparing to destroy the house.

867
01:01:01,030 --> 01:01:01,863
- I see.

868
01:01:03,110 --> 01:01:05,523
Well, there's something you can do.

869
01:01:06,550 --> 01:01:08,790
This changes everything.

870
01:01:09,696 --> 01:01:12,196
(eerie sound)

871
01:01:17,727 --> 01:01:20,810
(upbeat tense music)

872
01:02:05,900 --> 01:02:07,550
- Done with missile prep already?

873
01:02:10,630 --> 01:02:11,463
What goes here?

874
01:02:11,463 --> 01:02:13,182
Put that blaster down.

875
01:02:13,182 --> 01:02:14,165
(blaster firing)

876
01:02:14,165 --> 01:02:15,673
(Maitland grunting)

877
01:02:15,673 --> 01:02:16,506
(blaster firing)

878
01:02:16,506 --> 01:02:20,132
(Maitland grunting)

879
01:02:20,132 --> 01:02:22,037
(blaster firing)

880
01:02:22,037 --> 01:02:24,537
(eerie sound)

881
01:02:27,877 --> 01:02:30,377
- Maitland, transport us back.

882
01:02:32,110 --> 01:02:34,190
Maitland, this is Halstead.

883
01:02:34,190 --> 01:02:35,953
Beam us back immediately.

884
01:02:38,792 --> 01:02:40,249
- Something's wrong.

885
01:02:40,249 --> 01:02:42,381
(Nurmi screaming)

886
01:02:42,381 --> 01:02:44,337
Get it off, get it off, get it off.

887
01:02:44,337 --> 01:02:45,254
- Blast it.

888
01:02:46,328 --> 01:02:49,078
(blaster firing)

889
01:02:51,305 --> 01:02:54,375
Thanks for lending me a hand.

890
01:02:54,375 --> 01:02:55,208
- Very funny.

891
01:02:55,208 --> 01:02:57,857
(loud rumbling)

892
01:02:57,857 --> 01:02:59,024
What was that?

893
01:03:05,762 --> 01:03:08,762
(creature growling)

894
01:03:14,543 --> 01:03:15,564
- Fire.

895
01:03:15,564 --> 01:03:18,397
(blasters firing)

896
01:03:20,245 --> 01:03:21,955
- Up that way.

897
01:03:21,955 --> 01:03:24,788
(blasters firing)

898
01:03:25,958 --> 01:03:28,933
(creature growling)

899
01:03:28,933 --> 01:03:31,766
(blasters firing)

900
01:03:39,360 --> 01:03:40,263
- Brace the door.

901
01:03:44,790 --> 01:03:45,623
- Captain.

902
01:03:46,850 --> 01:03:48,400
- Jacowitz, where's Maitland?

903
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:49,390
We have a situation here

904
01:03:49,390 --> 01:03:51,960
and we need transportation immediately.

905
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:53,923
- I'm afraid I can't do that, Captain.

906
01:03:55,120 --> 01:03:57,820
Madam Tyse gave me strict
orders to stand down.

907
01:03:57,820 --> 01:04:00,290
- Don't listen to her, you fool.

908
01:04:00,290 --> 01:04:03,940
- She's sending a new team
to handle the situation.

909
01:04:03,940 --> 01:04:05,300
Sit tight.

910
01:04:05,300 --> 01:04:07,333
- It's no use, he's corrupted by it.

911
01:04:08,390 --> 01:04:10,571
- I'll deal with you later.

912
01:04:10,571 --> 01:04:15,571
(upbeat tense music)
(creature growling)

913
01:04:19,938 --> 01:04:22,938
(creature growling)

914
01:04:24,544 --> 01:04:25,576
- What are we gonna do?

915
01:04:25,576 --> 01:04:28,398
It's gonna rip us apart.

916
01:04:28,398 --> 01:04:29,981
- I'll handle this.

917
01:04:34,597 --> 01:04:38,740
Foul spirit, go back to whence you came.

918
01:04:38,740 --> 01:04:41,799
The power of God commands you.

919
01:04:41,799 --> 01:04:44,882
(creature screaming)

920
01:04:53,670 --> 01:04:56,410
Just a little something
from the good old days.

921
01:04:56,410 --> 01:04:58,697
- We could have used that a little sooner.

922
01:04:58,697 --> 01:05:02,525
(upbeat tense music)

923
01:05:02,525 --> 01:05:04,120
- What are we gonna do?

924
01:05:04,120 --> 01:05:06,543
We need to get back to the ship.

925
01:05:07,780 --> 01:05:08,613
- Sit tight.

926
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:12,113
- What's that?

927
01:05:13,660 --> 01:05:15,260
- You have a photon decelerator?

928
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:18,000
- What's that?

929
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,100
- It relocates molecular structures

930
01:05:20,100 --> 01:05:22,390
and moves them across a light beam.

931
01:05:22,390 --> 01:05:23,223
- What's that?

932
01:05:24,090 --> 01:05:26,143
- We can get back to the ship manually.

933
01:05:27,550 --> 01:05:28,750
- Why didn't you say so?

934
01:05:29,950 --> 01:05:31,423
- All right, here we go.

935
01:05:32,380 --> 01:05:33,673
Let's hope this works.

936
01:05:35,308 --> 01:05:38,391
(high pitched sound)

937
01:05:43,660 --> 01:05:44,897
- Good work.

938
01:05:44,897 --> 01:05:46,260
We did it.

939
01:05:46,260 --> 01:05:47,350
- Now what do we do?

940
01:05:47,350 --> 01:05:48,550
Your crew man Jacowitz

941
01:05:48,550 --> 01:05:50,800
is running around this ship possessed.

942
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:51,820
- First thing's first.

943
01:05:51,820 --> 01:05:54,957
We need to get to the bridge
and detonate the bomb.

944
01:05:54,957 --> 01:05:58,040
(upbeat tense music)

945
01:06:01,906 --> 01:06:04,906
(Jacowitz grunting)

946
01:06:07,065 --> 01:06:07,898
- No.

947
01:06:10,140 --> 01:06:11,964
Don't fight it, it's not use.

948
01:06:11,964 --> 01:06:13,041
- Hey.

949
01:06:13,041 --> 01:06:15,100
(Jacowitz screaming)

950
01:06:15,100 --> 01:06:17,012
(loud thud)

951
01:06:17,012 --> 01:06:18,650
(computer beeping)

952
01:06:18,650 --> 01:06:21,483
(house exploding)

953
01:06:23,532 --> 01:06:24,365
- No, no.

954
01:06:26,438 --> 01:06:29,521
(upbeat tense music)

955
01:06:34,980 --> 01:06:35,930
- Where's Jacowitz.

956
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:39,230
- Damn, I bet he's headed
to launch the missile.

957
01:06:39,230 --> 01:06:40,413
- We gotta stop him.

958
01:06:40,413 --> 01:06:43,496
(upbeat tense music)

959
01:06:51,105 --> 01:06:53,890
- The evil wasn't destroyed.

960
01:06:53,890 --> 01:06:54,892
Still here.

961
01:06:54,892 --> 01:06:57,475
(upbeat music)

962
01:07:03,363 --> 01:07:04,511
(computer beeping)

963
01:07:04,511 --> 01:07:07,178
(loud rumbling)

964
01:07:18,680 --> 01:07:20,253
- Step away from the console.

965
01:07:21,670 --> 01:07:23,270
- Too late, Captain.

966
01:07:23,270 --> 01:07:27,070
The launch sequence has been
started and can't be stopped.

967
01:07:27,070 --> 01:07:28,589
You lose.

968
01:07:28,589 --> 01:07:31,256
(loud rumbling)

969
01:07:32,589 --> 01:07:35,339
(blaster firing)

970
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:37,753
- What?

971
01:07:37,753 --> 01:07:39,644
He was asking for it.

972
01:07:39,644 --> 01:07:42,070
- We can't stop the warhead from firing.

973
01:07:42,070 --> 01:07:44,440
- But you can alter its direction.

974
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:46,220
- Yes, we can accomplish that.

975
01:07:46,220 --> 01:07:47,263
- Good, do it.

976
01:07:48,340 --> 01:07:49,740
- Wait, where are you going?

977
01:07:54,290 --> 01:07:55,827
- This is where our paths end.

978
01:07:57,100 --> 01:07:59,053
Good luck and godspeed.

979
01:08:00,230 --> 01:08:02,970
- Wait.
- He knows what he must do.

980
01:08:02,970 --> 01:08:06,951
Come, let's change the
direction of that missile.

981
01:08:06,951 --> 01:08:10,034
(upbeat tense music)

982
01:08:18,511 --> 01:08:21,511
(missile exploding)

983
01:08:31,793 --> 01:08:32,793
- We did it.

984
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:34,833
We did it.

985
01:08:38,904 --> 01:08:39,920
What is it?

986
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:41,523
- Ship's engines have failed.

987
01:08:41,523 --> 01:08:43,170
Blast must have taken them out.

988
01:08:43,170 --> 01:08:45,093
- So we're just adrift.

989
01:08:45,093 --> 01:08:47,927
We just have to wait until
new ship comes to get us.

990
01:08:49,270 --> 01:08:50,290
- There isn't enough time.

991
01:08:50,290 --> 01:08:51,123
We'll be...

992
01:08:54,760 --> 01:08:57,245
- We'll be pulled into the black hole

993
01:08:57,245 --> 01:08:59,467
before anybody comes to get us.

994
01:09:01,226 --> 01:09:04,352
- Yes.

995
01:09:04,352 --> 01:09:05,185
I'm sorry.

996
01:09:06,949 --> 01:09:09,654
There's nothing more we can do.

997
01:09:09,654 --> 01:09:12,141
(upbeat tense music)

998
01:09:12,141 --> 01:09:13,474
- Yes, there is.

999
01:09:14,341 --> 01:09:15,174
- What?

1000
01:09:16,650 --> 01:09:17,483
- Pray.

1001
01:09:20,556 --> 01:09:23,280
- Halstead, listen carefully.

1002
01:09:23,280 --> 01:09:26,250
I'm going to lure the
evil into the transport.

1003
01:09:26,250 --> 01:09:28,880
When I give the word direct us into space.

1004
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:31,191
- Okay, good luck, Benna.

1005
01:09:31,191 --> 01:09:34,274
(upbeat tense music)

1006
01:09:37,197 --> 01:09:40,614
(high pitched screaming)

1007
01:09:56,493 --> 01:09:59,493
- [Legion] No, no, you will not win.

1008
01:10:06,141 --> 01:10:08,090
- Now, Halstead.

1009
01:10:08,090 --> 01:10:09,240
Ready the laser cannon.

1010
01:10:14,856 --> 01:10:15,941
(computer beeping)

1011
01:10:15,941 --> 01:10:19,024
(high pitched sound)

1012
01:10:22,932 --> 01:10:23,765
- Do it.

1013
01:10:25,020 --> 01:10:30,020
(computer beeping)
(loud explosion)

1014
01:10:30,060 --> 01:10:32,893
(slow calm music)

1015
01:10:38,614 --> 01:10:41,482
- Welcome home, Father Benna.

1016
01:10:41,482 --> 01:10:42,362
Good job.

1017
01:10:42,362 --> 01:10:45,195
(slow calm music)

1018
01:10:54,376 --> 01:10:56,612
- Where do you think they went?

1019
01:10:56,612 --> 01:10:57,445
- Home.

1020
01:10:58,988 --> 01:11:03,821
- Where do you think we're
gonna go once we get sucked in?

1021
01:11:04,700 --> 01:11:07,653
- Beyond today and past tomorrow.

1022
01:11:18,381 --> 01:11:22,131
(space ship engines roaring)

1023
01:11:23,660 --> 01:11:27,010
- Madam Tyse, we've
arrived at the location

1024
01:11:27,010 --> 01:11:29,633
and nothing remains except the black hole.

1025
01:11:30,490 --> 01:11:32,390
- No traces of anything?

1026
01:11:32,390 --> 01:11:37,390
- No derelict structure, no
pentagram and no Wyoming 227.

1027
01:11:39,470 --> 01:11:43,710
- Very well, you may return to Aquarius.

1028
01:11:43,710 --> 01:11:45,810
- Would you like us to make another sweep?

1029
01:11:47,850 --> 01:11:49,973
- That won't be necessary.

1030
01:11:49,973 --> 01:11:53,320
(laughing maniacally)

1031
01:11:53,320 --> 01:11:56,000
Everything has gone to plan.

1032
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:59,500
(upbeat electronic music)

1033
01:14:30,010 --> 01:14:32,510
(eerie sound)
