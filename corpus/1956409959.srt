1
00:00:07,591 --> 00:00:10,659
Attention, everybody,
please. Hello. Phyllis,

2
00:00:10,702 --> 00:00:13,052
bang on a bigger glass.

3
00:00:13,096 --> 00:00:16,360
Hello. You give people food,
they won't shut up.

4
00:00:16,404 --> 00:00:18,536
Rabbi. Rabbi braverman.

5
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:19,885
Can I have a little help here?

6
00:00:19,929 --> 00:00:22,540
I'm trying to make a toast
at my son's bar mitzvah.

7
00:00:22,584 --> 00:00:25,935
Attention, please!
Ladies and gentlemen,

8
00:00:25,978 --> 00:00:30,447
let's all now take a moment
and look to our family.

9
00:00:30,592 --> 00:00:32,376
Thank you, rabbi.

10
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,204
To my son David.

11
00:00:34,247 --> 00:00:36,032
L'Chaim!

12
00:00:36,075 --> 00:00:38,251
Mazel tov!

13
00:00:38,295 --> 00:00:42,167
I think the only time I ever danced
with my sister was at my bar mitzvah,

14
00:00:42,299 --> 00:00:45,563
and she was not happy about it.

15
00:00:45,607 --> 00:00:48,261
She couldn't wait for
that song to end, and I

16
00:00:48,305 --> 00:00:52,526
remember thinking, "who is this strange
girl in a dress who looks like me?"

17
00:00:52,657 --> 00:00:53,789
She was a total mystery.

18
00:01:01,187 --> 00:01:03,102
God! Look at us!

19
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:05,757
That's how we spent our childhood,

20
00:01:05,801 --> 00:01:08,978
competing for mom and dad's
affection, which never ran out.

21
00:01:09,021 --> 00:01:11,633
Or, at least, it seemed
that way at the time.

22
00:01:14,853 --> 00:01:17,465
Suzanne could have gone
to a better college than

23
00:01:17,508 --> 00:01:20,163
she did, but she didn't want
the pressure.

24
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:37,223
The first sign that life
might not go exactly

25
00:01:37,267 --> 00:01:39,443
according to plan came
when Suzanne announced that

26
00:01:39,487 --> 00:01:41,750
she was giving up on
medical school. She said

27
00:01:41,793 --> 00:01:44,013
it was too hard, and she hated
being tested. Mom and dad

28
00:01:44,056 --> 00:01:47,843
thought that perhaps she was
making a big mistake.

29
00:01:47,886 --> 00:01:51,063
In the end, Suzanne prepared
for a career in retail.

30
00:01:51,107 --> 00:01:54,850
She now manages a clothing store.

31
00:01:54,893 --> 00:01:56,329
I, on the other hand,

32
00:01:56,373 --> 00:01:58,462
am irresponsible and happy.

33
00:01:58,506 --> 00:02:02,726
No chance of me being a doctor
or managing a clothing store.

34
00:02:02,858 --> 00:02:05,338
I'm an artist,
which my father says is defined

35
00:02:05,382 --> 00:02:08,178
as "one who doesn't make any money."

36
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:14,390
My dream, to direct and design
Wagner's opera the ring cycle.

37
00:02:14,522 --> 00:02:17,002
I'm not sure what Suzanne's dream is.

38
00:02:17,046 --> 00:02:19,056
Maybe she's already lived it.

39
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,663
Rob was her first real boyfriend.

40
00:02:25,707 --> 00:02:28,187
He was determined to win
the nobel prize...

41
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:31,669
for what, he hadn't decided.

42
00:02:31,713 --> 00:02:33,976
At least mom and dad finally
got a doctor in the family.

43
00:02:40,417 --> 00:02:44,290
As I watched them dance that night,
I remembered that other dance,

44
00:02:44,421 --> 00:02:46,641
at my bar mitzvah, and I wondered

45
00:02:46,684 --> 00:02:51,036
whether Suzanne and I
would stay that close.

46
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,343
Or, if we were ever close at all.

47
00:02:55,214 --> 00:02:59,392
Congratulations,
Suzanne, you're pregnant!

48
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:03,396
Suzanne, congratulations.
You're pregnant.

49
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,528
Suzanne, congratulations.

50
00:03:04,572 --> 00:03:06,051
You're pregnant. Pregnant.

51
00:03:06,095 --> 00:03:07,270
Congratulations, Suzanne.

52
00:03:07,313 --> 00:03:08,401
I'm very excited.

53
00:03:08,445 --> 00:03:09,533
You're pregnant.

54
00:03:46,788 --> 00:03:48,267
Suzanne!

55
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:50,226
Hi, sweetheart!

56
00:03:50,269 --> 00:03:52,141
Here she is!

57
00:03:52,184 --> 00:03:54,230
Finally!

58
00:03:55,405 --> 00:03:57,538
Oh, this is for you.

59
00:03:57,581 --> 00:03:58,582
Give me that coat.

60
00:03:58,626 --> 00:03:59,757
For the two of you.

61
00:03:59,801 --> 00:04:00,889
Mazel tov.

62
00:04:00,932 --> 00:04:02,455
It's a tablecloth.

63
00:04:02,499 --> 00:04:03,587
Same one we have.

64
00:04:03,631 --> 00:04:05,676
You always liked it,
so I figured it was safe.

65
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:08,397
You're just making it easier
for us to become like you.

66
00:04:08,398 --> 00:04:09,833
- Of course.
- Of course. Your dream.

67
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:10,967
Oh, I heard that!

68
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:12,770
Look at those chubby cheeks!

69
00:04:12,814 --> 00:04:16,295
Happy anniversary,
my sweet baby!

70
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:17,949
Come, sit down!

71
00:04:17,993 --> 00:04:19,777
Congratulations, Dr. Roth.

72
00:04:19,821 --> 00:04:20,952
Thank you, Walter.

73
00:04:20,996 --> 00:04:22,127
How long you been here, roth?

74
00:04:22,171 --> 00:04:23,302
Oh, 35 minutes.

75
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:25,566
I was watching the basketball game.

76
00:04:25,609 --> 00:04:27,219
Heck of a game. Where's David?

77
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:30,614
He'll be here any minute.
You know, he's, uh...

78
00:04:31,488 --> 00:04:35,271
Did you tell Suzanne who you
met at the beauty parlor?

79
00:04:45,194 --> 00:04:47,152
It's him! Is it?

80
00:04:47,196 --> 00:04:50,634
Yes! Aha! Wunderkind!

81
00:04:50,678 --> 00:04:52,984
Come in, come in.

82
00:04:53,028 --> 00:04:54,159
How are you, kiddo?

83
00:04:54,203 --> 00:04:55,770
Good to see you.

84
00:04:55,813 --> 00:04:57,293
Come in, sit down.

85
00:04:57,336 --> 00:04:58,424
Congratulations.

86
00:04:58,468 --> 00:04:59,556
Happy anniversary.

87
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,820
We're counting on you
to stick this out, Rob.

88
00:05:02,864 --> 00:05:04,169
There you are. For you.

89
00:05:04,213 --> 00:05:06,757
Oh, no, not again.

90
00:05:06,823 --> 00:05:08,691
This is Wilhelm Furtwangler's

91
00:05:08,692 --> 00:05:11,176
recording of Richard Wagner's
complete 4-opera cycle,

92
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:12,351
the ring of the nibelungen.

93
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:13,483
Enjoy!

94
00:05:14,658 --> 00:05:15,703
It'll go with the others.

95
00:05:15,746 --> 00:05:16,878
Yeah, the unopened others.

96
00:05:16,921 --> 00:05:18,357
I hate when he does this.

97
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:20,664
I'm trying to enrich your lives.

98
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:22,884
So, doesn't he look great, Phyllis?

99
00:05:22,927 --> 00:05:24,015
He's too thin.

100
00:05:24,059 --> 00:05:25,190
He's. Not. Too. Thin.

101
00:05:25,234 --> 00:05:27,018
- Come, come, come.
- Yum.

102
00:05:27,062 --> 00:05:28,193
We're never gonna open 'em.

103
00:05:28,237 --> 00:05:31,501
David, when are you gonna come to
the club and play tennis with me?

104
00:05:31,632 --> 00:05:34,384
Couldn't stand a chance on the court
with you, dad. You're a demon!

105
00:05:34,618 --> 00:05:35,085
So, guys...

106
00:05:35,118 --> 00:05:36,158
He's right, you're a demon.

107
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,073
...three years.

108
00:05:38,116 --> 00:05:39,204
Congratulations.

109
00:05:39,248 --> 00:05:40,123
Thanks.

110
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:43,527
Steven sends his regards. He would
have come, but he wasn't invited.

111
00:05:50,085 --> 00:05:53,435
Rob, you want to come in and
watch the basketball game with me?

112
00:05:53,566 --> 00:05:56,047
Good idea! And you two,
just like old times,

113
00:05:56,091 --> 00:05:58,008
come and help me with the dinner.

114
00:05:58,041 --> 00:06:01,052
Suzanne, the salad dressing,
your speciality,

115
00:06:01,096 --> 00:06:04,796
and sweetheart David,
the rolls in the basket, all right?

116
00:06:04,926 --> 00:06:07,189
Smells good, kasha!

117
00:06:07,232 --> 00:06:09,452
I think I need a bigger knife.

118
00:06:09,495 --> 00:06:10,583
No, not the knife again.

119
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:13,586
Ah! Be careful with that.

120
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:15,588
I'll be fine.

121
00:06:15,632 --> 00:06:17,721
So. How are you really?

122
00:06:17,765 --> 00:06:18,896
What?

123
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:20,071
You have lost weight, David.

124
00:06:20,115 --> 00:06:22,932
I can't wait for the day to come
that I can lose a few pounds,

125
00:06:22,933 --> 00:06:23,859
maybe catch a cold,

126
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,636
without everyone worrying about
what to read at the memorial.

127
00:06:26,737 --> 00:06:29,139
Oh, god! You're so dramatic!

128
00:06:31,648 --> 00:06:33,302
Well, how are you?

129
00:06:34,911 --> 00:06:36,392
I have a surprise.

130
00:06:36,435 --> 00:06:37,436
Thank god!

131
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,438
You're going back to medical school.

132
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:42,659
Mother, behave yourself
or we will put you in a home.

133
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:43,747
Stir.

134
00:06:43,791 --> 00:06:44,966
Stir? I've already stirred.

135
00:06:45,009 --> 00:06:46,184
They won't have kasha there.

136
00:06:46,228 --> 00:06:47,316
To Rob and Suzanne.

137
00:06:47,359 --> 00:06:49,753
To Rob and Suzanne.

138
00:06:49,797 --> 00:06:52,756
To my favorite
legally recognized couple.

139
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,978
May you have 35 years
together, and more,

140
00:06:57,021 --> 00:06:59,236
the way Phyllis and I have.

141
00:06:59,937 --> 00:07:01,330
Thank you, daddy.

142
00:07:01,373 --> 00:07:02,635
Thank you, Walter.

143
00:07:02,679 --> 00:07:05,464
Three years is very good.

144
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:07,771
Let's talk about Rob.

145
00:07:07,815 --> 00:07:10,643
Rob, how are things at the lab?

146
00:07:10,687 --> 00:07:12,776
Good. Actually, very good.

147
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:15,686
The genome project's a lot further
along than everybody thinks.

148
00:07:15,719 --> 00:07:17,953
- The what?
- Genome project.

149
00:07:17,954 --> 00:07:19,356
What... what is that?

150
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:22,481
Well, um...

151
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:27,095
We're in the process of identifying
all the human genetic information.

152
00:07:27,138 --> 00:07:28,226
Oh, I read about this.

153
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:29,358
This is for, um...

154
00:07:29,401 --> 00:07:30,968
Curing genetic diseases,

155
00:07:31,012 --> 00:07:32,622
gene therapy, prenatal testing.

156
00:07:32,665 --> 00:07:35,668
Have you got a test for a guy
who can't make a free-throw

157
00:07:35,712 --> 00:07:37,714
in the last two seconds?

158
00:07:37,758 --> 00:07:40,369
That's the test I'd like to see.

159
00:07:40,412 --> 00:07:41,674
My life is basketball.

160
00:07:41,718 --> 00:07:42,806
You okay?

161
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:44,025
David, we're playing tennis!

162
00:07:44,068 --> 00:07:46,157
All right, we'll play tennis.

163
00:07:46,201 --> 00:07:49,552
Sounds exciting, Rob.
I hope they pay you more money for it.

164
00:07:49,595 --> 00:07:51,467
We're doing fine, Walter.

165
00:07:52,642 --> 00:07:54,818
Friends and I are working
very hard. We're mounting

166
00:07:54,862 --> 00:07:58,169
our own production
of Wagner's ring cycle.

167
00:07:58,213 --> 00:07:59,344
Well, the ring cycle!

168
00:07:59,388 --> 00:08:00,476
Why?

169
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:02,173
There you go! Here we go.

170
00:08:02,217 --> 00:08:05,176
Most people ask the same
why the ring cycle?

171
00:08:06,221 --> 00:08:09,486
The situation in opera today is that
it's so dead and boring and dry...

172
00:08:10,616 --> 00:08:11,617
I vote for that, yes.

173
00:08:11,661 --> 00:08:13,968
And it's just
reserved for old rich people.

174
00:08:14,011 --> 00:08:15,970
What we're going to do
is we're going to reconceive it.

175
00:08:16,013 --> 00:08:16,971
We're bringing it up to speed.

176
00:08:17,014 --> 00:08:20,889
We're going to, uh, essentially make it
much more interesting for a younger crowd.

177
00:08:21,018 --> 00:08:22,106
Rich young people?

178
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:24,979
Well, if they have money
or not is entirely immaterial.

179
00:08:25,022 --> 00:08:25,980
But the point is...

180
00:08:26,023 --> 00:08:27,982
I would like to know what
it's going to cost me.

181
00:08:28,025 --> 00:08:28,983
Dollars!

182
00:08:29,026 --> 00:08:30,985
Bear in mind, Wagner never
had any money either.

183
00:08:31,028 --> 00:08:31,986
Tell them the story.

184
00:08:32,029 --> 00:08:35,293
Mother, if I told them the
story, we'd be here all night.

185
00:08:35,424 --> 00:08:36,555
Wake me when it's over.

186
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:37,687
We all know the story.

187
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:39,384
...reader's digest version.

188
00:08:39,428 --> 00:08:43,345
It's about this gold ring, Rob,
where everybody runs around...

189
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,870
and screaming, fighting over the ring.

190
00:08:46,914 --> 00:08:49,351
For this, you have to sit for a week.

191
00:08:49,394 --> 00:08:50,874
Twenty-three hours.

192
00:08:50,918 --> 00:08:52,615
With intermissions.

193
00:08:52,658 --> 00:08:55,792
This is what he does with
his talent, this talented boy.

194
00:08:55,836 --> 00:08:59,795
How long are they gonna sit to watch
amateurs with horns on their heads?

195
00:08:59,927 --> 00:09:01,711
Tell me! Tell me!

196
00:09:01,754 --> 00:09:02,843
That is ridiculous.

197
00:09:02,886 --> 00:09:05,062
Aren't you lucky that we
condensed it to 6 1/2 hours,

198
00:09:05,106 --> 00:09:08,109
and we're calling it the mini ring.

199
00:09:08,152 --> 00:09:09,893
Oh, I'd better not blink!

200
00:09:09,937 --> 00:09:12,156
Wagner, he was...
wasn't he an anti-semite?

201
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,942
An egocentric genius,
but that's a simplification.

202
00:09:14,985 --> 00:09:17,248
Wagner might have had Jewish blood.

203
00:09:17,292 --> 00:09:19,511
Jewish anti-semites, they're the worst.

204
00:09:19,555 --> 00:09:21,745
Suzanne, don't eat from his mouth!

205
00:09:28,185 --> 00:09:32,045
Listen, we can afford for everyone
to have their own macaroon.

206
00:09:32,356 --> 00:09:34,091
So, um...

207
00:09:34,135 --> 00:09:37,442
I want to, um,
hear more about Rob's project.

208
00:09:37,486 --> 00:09:41,490
Rob, so, tell us, what are you, um,
what are you testing for, again?

209
00:09:41,533 --> 00:09:42,621
Everything.

210
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:46,582
Physical, psychological,
emotional characteristics.

211
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:48,504
That's pretty scary, if you think about it.

212
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:50,340
Well, the more we know,
the more we can do.

213
00:09:50,374 --> 00:09:53,743
I read in The Times
that there were women who had

214
00:09:53,744 --> 00:09:56,983
abortions when they found out they
were having girls instead of boys.

215
00:09:57,114 --> 00:09:58,072
What about that?

216
00:09:58,115 --> 00:09:59,073
Yes.

217
00:09:59,116 --> 00:10:01,075
Oh, that's...
a world with more boys.

218
00:10:01,118 --> 00:10:02,076
You'd like that!

219
00:10:02,119 --> 00:10:03,120
Easy with the jokes, Rob!

220
00:10:03,164 --> 00:10:05,122
We don't do no jokes in this family!

221
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:06,123
All I'm saying, David...

222
00:10:06,167 --> 00:10:07,472
No, we're giving people choices.

223
00:10:07,516 --> 00:10:10,387
Do you have any idea what horrible
defects can strike a person?

224
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:12,477
I can't listen to this anymore.

225
00:10:12,521 --> 00:10:14,479
I didn't mean to offend
your brother. I'm sorry.

226
00:10:14,523 --> 00:10:15,480
Can you just stop?

227
00:10:15,524 --> 00:10:16,800
Sweetheart, what's the matter?

228
00:10:16,867 --> 00:10:20,659
What? Are you sick?

229
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:22,313
I'm pregnant.

230
00:10:29,016 --> 00:10:31,105
- I can't believe it!
- Ohh!

231
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:36,545
The golds rule!

232
00:10:36,588 --> 00:10:37,546
Are you kidding me?

233
00:10:37,589 --> 00:10:40,157
I knew it when we...
when we were in the kitchen.

234
00:10:40,201 --> 00:10:41,158
You're mad!

235
00:10:41,202 --> 00:10:43,204
Yes, well, why shouldn't I be mad?

236
00:10:43,247 --> 00:10:44,292
Why shouldn't you be mad?

237
00:10:44,335 --> 00:10:45,475
I just thought it would be nice.

238
00:10:45,576 --> 00:10:47,469
I thought it would be nice
to share it with everybody.

239
00:10:47,599 --> 00:10:48,687
You didn't even look at me.

240
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:49,688
Yes, I did!

241
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:53,560
Honey, I was waiting for your father to ask
me what my involvement was, for god's sake!

242
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:55,172
You're just so paranoid!

243
00:10:55,216 --> 00:10:57,807
Look, all I'm saying is
there's some things between

244
00:10:57,808 --> 00:10:59,524
you and me that don't have
to revolve around the Golds.

245
00:10:59,568 --> 00:11:01,874
Look, just because you don't
get along with your parents

246
00:11:01,918 --> 00:11:03,876
doesn't mean that you have
to take it out on me.

247
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,115
Listen, if you reject your family
before they reject you,

248
00:11:06,216 --> 00:11:07,918
which they will,
you're gonna be better off.

249
00:11:24,245 --> 00:11:25,550
Chuckles died.

250
00:11:25,594 --> 00:11:26,725
When's the funeral?

251
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,380
How was dinner?

252
00:11:29,424 --> 00:11:30,991
Well, let me put it this way:

253
00:11:31,034 --> 00:11:32,275
Suzanne's pregnant.

254
00:11:33,076 --> 00:11:33,643
No!

255
00:11:33,744 --> 00:11:34,745
Yeah, she's pregnant.

256
00:11:34,811 --> 00:11:35,945
So she and Rob actually...

257
00:11:35,946 --> 00:11:37,040
...Do. Have. Sex.

258
00:11:37,084 --> 00:11:38,737
Oh, god! Can you imagine?

259
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:41,914
Oh, god! That's great.

260
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:42,915
Congratulations.

261
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:44,004
You were born to be an uncle.

262
00:11:44,047 --> 00:11:45,005
Thank you.

263
00:11:45,048 --> 00:11:47,007
Um, did my name come up, by chance?

264
00:11:49,444 --> 00:11:50,401
Sorry.

265
00:11:50,445 --> 00:11:51,428
- Yeah.
- Sorry.

266
00:11:51,595 --> 00:11:52,762
I got it.

267
00:11:52,763 --> 00:11:56,600
Could you get chuckles there? Walter's
kind of looking at him like, um...

268
00:11:57,452 --> 00:11:58,975
Guess we need another fish.

269
00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:00,977
I hope these things cost about 20 bucks.

270
00:12:01,021 --> 00:12:05,895
You gotta make my eyebrows
a little darker, grandma!

271
00:12:05,938 --> 00:12:07,766
Wouldn't it be nice...

272
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:10,073
if they give Rob...

273
00:12:10,117 --> 00:12:13,250
a raise in salary,
with the baby on the way, huh?

274
00:12:13,717 --> 00:12:16,036
Well, maybe. If not,
I'll give him more money.

275
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,342
Between the opera and the baby,

276
00:12:18,386 --> 00:12:22,259
I may have to get a nighttime
job driving a cab.

277
00:12:23,304 --> 00:12:24,783
General practice.

278
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:27,438
That's where the bucks are.

279
00:12:27,482 --> 00:12:30,666
If only Suzanne
would have stuck with it.

280
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:31,442
But she didn't.

281
00:12:31,486 --> 00:12:34,706
We let our children
live their own lives.

282
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:37,274
I should have just let her eat it.

283
00:12:37,318 --> 00:12:38,275
What?

284
00:12:38,319 --> 00:12:39,972
The macaroon.

285
00:12:40,016 --> 00:12:42,627
Why did I open my mouth?

286
00:12:42,671 --> 00:12:45,326
Oh, sweetheart, nobody noticed.

287
00:12:45,369 --> 00:12:46,849
David had a wonderful time.

288
00:12:46,892 --> 00:12:50,113
David and Suzanne,
I worry about 'em, so...

289
00:12:50,157 --> 00:12:51,288
Oh...

290
00:12:51,332 --> 00:12:52,463
David's gonna be fine.

291
00:12:52,556 --> 00:12:54,424
Just needs a haircut.

292
00:13:00,689 --> 00:13:02,866
Grandma!

293
00:13:05,172 --> 00:13:06,903
Grandma!

294
00:13:39,036 --> 00:13:40,685
What are you doing?

295
00:13:40,729 --> 00:13:41,686
What is that?

296
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:43,166
What, you made coffee?

297
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:44,559
How long you been up?

298
00:13:44,602 --> 00:13:45,560
What is this?

299
00:13:45,603 --> 00:13:47,562
Ooh, very hot. Hot.

300
00:13:47,605 --> 00:13:49,041
What are you doing?

301
00:13:49,085 --> 00:13:50,414
What are you doing?

302
00:14:00,749 --> 00:14:01,706
I'm sorry.

303
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:02,707
No, I'm sorry.

304
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:03,708
No, I am.

305
00:14:03,752 --> 00:14:04,796
No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry,

306
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,058
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

307
00:14:06,102 --> 00:14:07,059
Honey, honey.

308
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:08,713
No, I was a jerk.

309
00:14:08,757 --> 00:14:09,714
No, you weren't. No.

310
00:14:09,758 --> 00:14:10,715
You were right.

311
00:14:10,759 --> 00:14:11,716
I should've. I should've.

312
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,804
I should've told you first.

313
00:14:12,848 --> 00:14:14,371
That was stupid. I'm sorry.

314
00:14:14,415 --> 00:14:17,006
You know, I just... I...
with everybody, I just got scared...

315
00:14:17,007 --> 00:14:19,008
Honey, honey, honey, honey.

316
00:14:19,009 --> 00:14:21,987
...and then I felt like I should
rally the troops, you know?

317
00:14:22,118 --> 00:14:23,206
That's what I felt like.

318
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:25,208
And I think it was because...
You know why?

319
00:14:25,252 --> 00:14:26,427
Honey, honey, honey, honey.

320
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:28,385
I... I was worried that I...

321
00:14:28,429 --> 00:14:30,220
Honey, hey. Shh.

322
00:14:32,259 --> 00:14:34,217
It's a good thing.

323
00:14:34,261 --> 00:14:35,218
Really?

324
00:14:35,262 --> 00:14:36,219
This is a great thing.

325
00:14:36,263 --> 00:14:37,220
Are you happy?

326
00:14:37,264 --> 00:14:38,221
I am so happy.

327
00:14:38,265 --> 00:14:39,222
Really?

328
00:14:39,266 --> 00:14:40,864
I am so happy!

329
00:14:50,277 --> 00:14:51,582
Rob!

330
00:14:51,626 --> 00:14:52,583
Congratulations.

331
00:14:53,343 --> 00:14:54,585
- Thank you.
- Got a minute?

332
00:14:54,629 --> 00:14:57,109
Sure. It's just...
it's all a little overwhelming.

333
00:14:57,153 --> 00:14:58,110
Oh, this is nothing.

334
00:14:58,154 --> 00:15:01,685
Wait till we clone the kid...
that's the party I'm waiting for!

335
00:15:05,689 --> 00:15:06,890
Hi.

336
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:11,123
Are you and Suzanne
going to test for the sex,

337
00:15:11,167 --> 00:15:13,604
or... do you want a surprise?

338
00:15:13,648 --> 00:15:15,780
Oh, we haven't even
talked about that yet.

339
00:15:15,824 --> 00:15:18,130
You've got an obstetrician.

340
00:15:18,174 --> 00:15:20,611
Yeah, an old friend of Suzanne's dad.

341
00:15:21,271 --> 00:15:23,205
You all right with that?

342
00:15:23,206 --> 00:15:26,643
Well, they've played tennis
at the club for years.

343
00:15:30,186 --> 00:15:32,144
Well, uh, you're Jewish.

344
00:15:32,188 --> 00:15:36,496
I think we should test for Tay-Sachs,
and I think we should do it here...

345
00:15:36,627 --> 00:15:38,673
the entire genetic series.

346
00:15:38,716 --> 00:15:41,893
Oh, I don't know if we need
to do a whole genetic series.

347
00:15:41,937 --> 00:15:44,828
We have all the technology
at our fingerprints, Rob.

348
00:15:44,995 --> 00:15:46,289
Well, I appreciate the offer, but, um...

349
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:50,119
aren't we, um, hypocrites
to test only on strangers?

350
00:15:51,001 --> 00:15:53,165
You stand by the work
we've done, don't you?

351
00:15:53,209 --> 00:15:54,166
Well, of course.

352
00:15:54,738 --> 00:15:56,647
- Of course I do.
- That's what matters.

353
00:15:56,691 --> 00:15:59,824
That, and a healthy baby.

354
00:16:01,278 --> 00:16:02,653
I'm gonna be an aunt?

355
00:16:02,697 --> 00:16:05,221
Oh, suze, congratulations!

356
00:16:05,265 --> 00:16:06,222
Thank you.

357
00:16:06,266 --> 00:16:07,876
Okay, we're having a shower.

358
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:08,877
Oh, god.

359
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:09,965
Yes, don't try to stop me.

360
00:16:10,008 --> 00:16:12,794
I am throwing you a baby shower,

361
00:16:12,837 --> 00:16:14,274
with tons of champagne.

362
00:16:14,317 --> 00:16:15,492
I can't even drink champagne!

363
00:16:15,536 --> 00:16:17,494
Well, it's not for you,
it's for me. Cristal.

364
00:16:17,538 --> 00:16:19,670
Only the best. And I think
we should have a male stripper.

365
00:16:19,714 --> 00:16:21,759
Oh, god! I think I could do
without the stripper!

366
00:16:21,803 --> 00:16:23,805
Yeah, well, that's also not for you.

367
00:16:23,848 --> 00:16:24,806
Sable and pearls!

368
00:16:24,849 --> 00:16:26,764
Try to sell it, Brandon.

369
00:16:26,808 --> 00:16:27,765
Sable and pearls!

370
00:16:27,809 --> 00:16:30,039
Come on, sell it. Sell it!

371
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,240
Sable and pearls!

372
00:16:31,241 --> 00:16:32,335
I know it's kind of personal,

373
00:16:32,379 --> 00:16:34,555
but I would like to know,

374
00:16:34,598 --> 00:16:36,252
do you want a boy or a girl?

375
00:16:36,296 --> 00:16:38,776
Well, it doesn't really
matter if it's a boy or girl.

376
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:41,213
Really, the most important
thing is if the baby is healthy.

377
00:16:41,257 --> 00:16:42,345
I know. Everybody says that.

378
00:16:42,389 --> 00:16:44,347
Do you want a boy or do you want a girl?

379
00:16:44,391 --> 00:16:45,348
Girl.

380
00:16:45,392 --> 00:16:46,349
Oh, god, a girl!

381
00:16:46,393 --> 00:16:49,559
I'm so happy! I wanted you
to want a girl! Oh, god!

382
00:16:49,626 --> 00:16:50,726
Suze, look at these.

383
00:16:50,727 --> 00:16:53,182
We could get them...
very good deal.

384
00:16:53,225 --> 00:16:55,358
Hand-woven Peruvian alpaca?

385
00:16:55,402 --> 00:16:56,359
Mm-hmm.

386
00:16:56,403 --> 00:16:57,360
I don't think so.

387
00:16:57,404 --> 00:17:00,537
You wash this once, it'll make
a nice hand puppet. Not for you.

388
00:17:00,581 --> 00:17:02,365
You know, you're good.

389
00:17:02,409 --> 00:17:05,542
I'm not kidding. You really are.
You're really good.

390
00:17:05,586 --> 00:17:08,153
Now, listen, what do you say
we go out tonight and celebrate?

391
00:17:08,197 --> 00:17:09,154
I can't.

392
00:17:09,198 --> 00:17:10,417
What do you mean you can't?

393
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:13,681
We're breaking the news
to Rob's parents.

394
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:21,079
Amen.

395
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:22,259
Amen.

396
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:28,913
So. The baby.

397
00:17:28,957 --> 00:17:30,567
We're gonna raise it orthodox.

398
00:17:30,611 --> 00:17:31,568
Oh, come on, dad.

399
00:17:31,612 --> 00:17:32,569
It'll be bar mitzvahed.

400
00:17:32,613 --> 00:17:33,570
That should be fine.

401
00:17:33,614 --> 00:17:34,919
We raised you orthodox.

402
00:17:34,963 --> 00:17:37,269
Yeah, look how well I turned out.

403
00:17:37,313 --> 00:17:41,143
Well, we think that the child should
feel free to choose the way that he...

404
00:17:41,186 --> 00:17:44,189
or she wants to worship.

405
00:17:46,453 --> 00:17:48,890
Maybe that came out wrong.

406
00:17:48,933 --> 00:17:54,154
God gives you a child to raise for him,
not to let run wild in the streets.

407
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:56,332
Dad, don't talk to Suzanne
that way, all right?

408
00:17:56,376 --> 00:17:58,116
You hear that? Disobedient.

409
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,292
Rude.

410
00:18:00,336 --> 00:18:03,383
That's what you get when you allow
a child to live however he wants.

411
00:18:03,426 --> 00:18:05,602
Fine. Maybe there's some
things you don't like about me,

412
00:18:05,646 --> 00:18:07,735
pop, but there's some things
I don't like about you.

413
00:18:07,778 --> 00:18:09,780
This is what you get,
a son who turns his back

414
00:18:09,824 --> 00:18:13,110
on his faith, who makes a living
performing medical experiments.

415
00:18:13,143 --> 00:18:14,916
See, here we go.
This is why I don't come here.

416
00:18:14,959 --> 00:18:18,215
He wanted to be a doctor,
to heal people. So wonderful!

417
00:18:19,834 --> 00:18:23,794
So be a doctor, but don't...
don't do god's work!

418
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:27,145
Dad, could we please not do this now?

419
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:28,451
You're a Jew!

420
00:18:28,495 --> 00:18:30,627
Do you know how dangerous
it is, what you're doing?

421
00:18:30,671 --> 00:18:31,802
Knowledge is neutral, dad!

422
00:18:31,846 --> 00:18:34,022
It's what bad people do with
that knowledge that's dangerous.

423
00:18:34,065 --> 00:18:35,589
God, you're so young.

424
00:18:36,566 --> 00:18:39,724
Let me tell you, it's the "good"
people you have to watch out for.

425
00:18:39,854 --> 00:18:42,857
I'm not gonna let you get to me anymore.

426
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:43,858
Mom, I'm sorry.

427
00:18:43,901 --> 00:18:45,175
Don't you turn your back on me!

428
00:18:47,035 --> 00:18:49,994
We have a very happy life, dad.

429
00:18:50,038 --> 00:18:51,082
I don't need your approval.

430
00:18:51,126 --> 00:18:53,650
Yes, you do, Mr. Big shot!

431
00:18:53,694 --> 00:18:55,852
Oh, you think you can go your own way.

432
00:18:55,952 --> 00:18:57,888
You cannot escape from what you are.

433
00:19:00,657 --> 00:19:02,354
Come on, now, let's go.

434
00:19:02,398 --> 00:19:03,794
Listen.

435
00:19:04,879 --> 00:19:08,532
I used to thank god for the day
he decided to become a doctor.

436
00:19:10,928 --> 00:19:13,496
Now I curse it.

437
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:15,706
Medical experiments!
Did you hear him say that?

438
00:19:15,772 --> 00:19:18,341
I know, but you can't
let that get to you.

439
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:20,677
Is that what you think I do?

440
00:19:20,721 --> 00:19:23,313
I respect what you do, you know that.

441
00:19:24,899 --> 00:19:26,030
I spoke to Adrian.

442
00:19:26,074 --> 00:19:29,119
He said, um, that he could run
the new tests on you and the baby.

443
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:31,906
You know, check for tay-sachs,
down syndrome, stuff like that.

444
00:19:31,949 --> 00:19:34,517
I hate... I hate even
talking about this.

445
00:19:34,561 --> 00:19:37,227
It's just... you know, when it's
your own baby, it just isn't very...

446
00:19:37,361 --> 00:19:39,730
I shouldn't have
even brought it up. Forget it.

447
00:19:47,504 --> 00:19:48,772
I'll do it.

448
00:19:49,924 --> 00:19:51,942
I will. I want to do it.

449
00:19:54,578 --> 00:19:56,947
It's better to know, don't you think?

450
00:19:58,759 --> 00:20:01,239
Hello! I said I will do it!

451
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:03,854
You don't have to be mopey anymore.

452
00:20:05,461 --> 00:20:07,257
I love you.

453
00:20:07,357 --> 00:20:09,526
- All right?
- Yeah. I'm better than you.

454
00:20:09,626 --> 00:20:10,422
I'm fine.

455
00:20:11,194 --> 00:20:13,864
Sure. Yeah.

456
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:16,907
Just take it easy. Relax.

457
00:20:19,606 --> 00:20:20,563
Okay?

458
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:22,072
Mm-hmm.

459
00:20:28,078 --> 00:20:29,046
Hey.

460
00:20:52,536 --> 00:20:54,304
Amazing.

461
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:03,171
Hi, I'm from out of town,
just visiting here,

462
00:21:03,214 --> 00:21:06,522
but I saw your ad in the paper,
and I just love opera.

463
00:21:06,566 --> 00:21:09,525
And I am such a fan of
your work, Mr. Wagner,

464
00:21:09,569 --> 00:21:11,554
but, um, I don't know
any arias, but I can...

465
00:21:11,555 --> 00:21:14,965
I can sing popular songs, like opera.

466
00:21:15,009 --> 00:21:15,966
Like what?

467
00:21:27,021 --> 00:21:30,807
I think you'll find
I'm the perfect hero type.

468
00:21:42,732 --> 00:21:43,690
Hi.

469
00:21:43,733 --> 00:21:44,691
Good afternoon.

470
00:21:44,734 --> 00:21:46,562
My name's Cheery Robinson.

471
00:21:46,606 --> 00:21:48,390
That's Cheery with two "e's."

472
00:21:48,433 --> 00:21:49,391
Make a note of that.

473
00:21:49,434 --> 00:21:50,392
I'm sorry I'm late.

474
00:21:50,435 --> 00:21:54,657
I wanted to change my uniform, but I...
was having a really bad day, so I was...

475
00:21:54,701 --> 00:21:58,835
my chain broke as I was on my way here.

476
00:21:58,879 --> 00:22:00,924
Do you, um,
do you need to take a minute?

477
00:22:00,968 --> 00:22:01,925
No, I'm all right.

478
00:22:01,969 --> 00:22:03,144
Okay, do you have a piece...?

479
00:22:03,187 --> 00:22:07,365
I had a different pen,
but I have a marker.

480
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:08,366
I'm just...

481
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:10,673
You have a... a what?

482
00:22:10,717 --> 00:22:13,197
A marker. I'm sorry.

483
00:22:13,241 --> 00:22:14,198
Okay, I'm ready.

484
00:22:14,242 --> 00:22:15,243
All right!

485
00:22:15,286 --> 00:22:17,767
It's okay. She's just a little upset.

486
00:22:17,811 --> 00:22:20,724
Listen, why don't you
take a deep breath?

487
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:25,340
Good!

488
00:22:27,385 --> 00:22:28,343
Yeah.

489
00:22:28,386 --> 00:22:29,866
- You feel better?
- Yeah.

490
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:31,346
- Do you have a song for me?
- Mm-hmm.

491
00:22:31,535 --> 00:22:33,136
Okay, what is it?

492
00:22:40,644 --> 00:22:41,545
David, no.

493
00:22:41,611 --> 00:22:44,228
We are not naming
our firstborn Siegfried.

494
00:22:44,272 --> 00:22:46,404
It's heroic? It's ridiculous!

495
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:48,276
People are gonna call him Ziggy.

496
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:49,581
You go back to work.

497
00:22:49,625 --> 00:22:50,713
Yeah, go make some money.

498
00:22:50,757 --> 00:22:52,410
We're all so ashamed of you!

499
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:54,458
I'm kidding!

500
00:22:54,524 --> 00:22:56,066
God!

501
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:57,494
'Bye.

502
00:22:57,938 --> 00:23:00,244
David's more excited than we are.

503
00:23:00,397 --> 00:23:04,634
Look, I found the perfect fabric
for the bumper.

504
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:07,104
See? Bears.

505
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:09,573
Bumper.

506
00:23:11,952 --> 00:23:12,909
What?

507
00:23:13,343 --> 00:23:14,878
We should talk.

508
00:23:17,247 --> 00:23:18,915
Oh, god.

509
00:23:20,134 --> 00:23:22,092
It's deformed.
It's deformed, isn't it?

510
00:23:22,136 --> 00:23:23,615
No, honey, no, no, no.

511
00:23:23,659 --> 00:23:25,095
It's got no arms, right?

512
00:23:25,139 --> 00:23:26,618
And it's blind.

513
00:23:26,662 --> 00:23:27,663
It's nothing like that.

514
00:23:27,707 --> 00:23:28,925
Well, what?

515
00:23:28,969 --> 00:23:29,926
Let's go through it.

516
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:31,754
It's, uh...

517
00:23:31,798 --> 00:23:32,755
We...

518
00:23:35,802 --> 00:23:36,759
It's a boy.

519
00:23:40,458 --> 00:23:42,765
No physical deformities.

520
00:23:42,809 --> 00:23:43,766
Ten fingers?

521
00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:45,289
Ten fingers, ten toes.

522
00:23:45,333 --> 00:23:49,119
Well, then, what?
What is it? What? Is it...

523
00:23:49,163 --> 00:23:51,581
is it, um, retarded?

524
00:23:51,818 --> 00:23:54,908
No, as a matter of fact, it looks
like it will be quite intelligent.

525
00:23:55,686 --> 00:23:57,127
Probably left-handed.

526
00:23:57,171 --> 00:23:58,128
Really?

527
00:23:58,321 --> 00:23:59,890
You can tell that?

528
00:24:00,957 --> 00:24:01,915
Well, then, what?

529
00:24:01,958 --> 00:24:03,994
What is the... the problem?

530
00:24:04,061 --> 00:24:05,353
No, it's, uh...

531
00:24:05,396 --> 00:24:08,231
It'll probably be... like David.

532
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:10,867
What does that mean?

533
00:24:11,001 --> 00:24:12,316
Well, we, uh...

534
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,405
We matched the chromosomes
from the test with the data

535
00:24:14,449 --> 00:24:18,322
we've compiled, and we've found
the presence of those genes

536
00:24:18,366 --> 00:24:24,381
that statistically have been
linked to that trait.

537
00:24:26,026 --> 00:24:27,851
Oh...

538
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:32,815
I... I didn't...

539
00:24:32,859 --> 00:24:34,948
I didn't even know that
you could do a test like that.

540
00:24:34,991 --> 00:24:38,516
Well, Adrian estimates a 90% certainty.

541
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:43,347
Although he has a very big ego,
so who knows?

542
00:24:43,391 --> 00:24:44,348
Ninety?

543
00:24:44,392 --> 00:24:45,349
Ninety? Ninety percent?

544
00:24:45,535 --> 00:24:47,237
I believe him.

545
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:12,376
So, do you get nauseous yet?

546
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:13,725
Please, I'm eating here.

547
00:25:13,769 --> 00:25:14,726
Oh, stop.

548
00:25:14,770 --> 00:25:16,728
Did the doctor check everything out?

549
00:25:16,772 --> 00:25:18,078
Everything is fine.

550
00:25:18,121 --> 00:25:19,079
Oh, good!

551
00:25:19,122 --> 00:25:21,429
Mom, you're making me nervous.

552
00:25:21,472 --> 00:25:22,430
Hi, Suzanne.

553
00:25:22,473 --> 00:25:23,431
Hi, Debbie.

554
00:25:23,673 --> 00:25:26,869
Oh, isn't he adorable?

555
00:25:26,913 --> 00:25:28,392
How old is he?

556
00:25:28,436 --> 00:25:29,393
It's she.

557
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:32,749
Seventeen months already.
Can you believe it?

558
00:25:32,816 --> 00:25:34,572
Well, we'll be joining you soon.

559
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:35,878
No kidding? Mazel tov.

560
00:25:35,922 --> 00:25:36,879
Congratulations.

561
00:25:36,923 --> 00:25:37,880
Thank you.

562
00:25:37,924 --> 00:25:40,187
I have a lot of stuff in
storage, Suzanne. I'll call you.

563
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:42,754
Yes, call her, or Suzanne will call you.

564
00:25:42,798 --> 00:25:43,886
Where's David?

565
00:25:43,930 --> 00:25:46,193
David is working hard on an opera.

566
00:25:46,596 --> 00:25:48,064
Oh, that's interesting.

567
00:25:48,108 --> 00:25:50,240
We just saw phantom again.

568
00:25:50,284 --> 00:25:53,069
Enjoy the rest of your meal,
Walter. Tennis tomorrow?

569
00:25:53,113 --> 00:25:54,971
Ten o'clock, Ed.

570
00:25:55,942 --> 00:25:57,900
Not everyone has to know
that I'm pregnant.

571
00:25:57,944 --> 00:25:59,946
Sweetheart, we're very excited.

572
00:25:59,989 --> 00:26:00,947
We're very proud.

573
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:03,079
We just didn't want to tell
a lot of people right away.

574
00:26:03,123 --> 00:26:03,814
Oh, really?

575
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:06,116
I don't think
Mrs. Glaser heard you.

576
00:26:06,216 --> 00:26:07,605
Glaser's deaf, right?

577
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:08,606
No, she fakes it.

578
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:09,912
She hears everything.

579
00:26:09,956 --> 00:26:11,566
Okay, we're sorry.

580
00:26:11,609 --> 00:26:14,917
Am I crazy, or did you
get a load of that Klein kid?

581
00:26:14,961 --> 00:26:17,627
Mmm! Ugly as sin!

582
00:26:18,486 --> 00:26:19,835
I thought he was a boy!

583
00:26:20,964 --> 00:26:23,404
You'll show 'em.
Yours'll be perfect.

584
00:26:24,801 --> 00:26:26,737
Let's get some dessert.

585
00:26:27,321 --> 00:26:29,279
All I'm saying is
the test could be wrong.

586
00:26:29,323 --> 00:26:30,367
Yeah, no, it's possible.

587
00:26:30,411 --> 00:26:32,587
I'm saying it's very unlikely,
according to Adrian.

588
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:33,588
You know, enough.

589
00:26:33,631 --> 00:26:34,589
Enough with Adrian.

590
00:26:34,632 --> 00:26:35,590
What do you think?

591
00:26:35,633 --> 00:26:38,749
What? I think it's
very convincing. I said that.

592
00:26:39,986 --> 00:26:41,291
Oh, honey, I'm not saying that...

593
00:26:41,335 --> 00:26:44,206
Look, if you feel up to raising this
kid, of course, that's what we'll do.

594
00:26:44,338 --> 00:26:47,296
I'm just saying it's not exactly
how we pictured it, you know?

595
00:26:47,428 --> 00:26:49,726
Well, nothing is, you know?

596
00:26:50,431 --> 00:26:52,912
You know, what about...
what about environment?

597
00:26:52,955 --> 00:26:56,131
I mean, if we know before,
couldn't we raise it in such a way...?

598
00:26:56,263 --> 00:26:57,220
How?

599
00:26:57,264 --> 00:26:59,309
Well, aren't there psychiatrists
who say that...?

600
00:26:59,353 --> 00:27:01,311
Judging how clearly it shows
up in the statistical evidence,

601
00:27:01,355 --> 00:27:03,966
there'd just be a lot of
nature to nurture against.

602
00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:06,316
Yes, but we could try
something like that.

603
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:09,413
If that's what you want to do,
if you'll be happy with that.

604
00:27:11,181 --> 00:27:12,916
Are you mad at me?

605
00:27:14,184 --> 00:27:17,220
No, of course not.
It's a stupid thing to say.

606
00:27:18,546 --> 00:27:20,983
He's my brother.

607
00:27:21,027 --> 00:27:21,984
I...

608
00:27:24,261 --> 00:27:25,726
Hello?

609
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:27,337
Hello, Steven.

610
00:27:27,381 --> 00:27:28,338
It's Phyllis calling.

611
00:27:28,382 --> 00:27:31,341
Oh, hi, Mrs. Gold!

612
00:27:31,385 --> 00:27:32,995
Is David there?

613
00:27:34,671 --> 00:27:36,707
Uh... is David here?

614
00:27:39,219 --> 00:27:42,222
Yeah. Yeah, sure. He's here.

615
00:27:45,921 --> 00:27:46,750
Hello, mother.

616
00:27:46,783 --> 00:27:48,085
Hi, sweetheart.

617
00:27:48,228 --> 00:27:50,186
We went to the club for dinner.

618
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:51,187
Saw the Kleins.

619
00:27:51,231 --> 00:27:53,363
And how are the Kleins?
Still perfect?

620
00:27:55,092 --> 00:27:58,151
So, your sister's...
acting peculiar.

621
00:27:58,194 --> 00:28:00,153
That's because she's pregnant, mother.

622
00:28:00,196 --> 00:28:01,502
Isn't that normal?

623
00:28:01,545 --> 00:28:02,503
No, that's menopause.

624
00:28:02,546 --> 00:28:04,984
You have a lot to learn about women.

625
00:28:05,135 --> 00:28:06,903
Apparently.

626
00:28:07,943 --> 00:28:09,673
You think there's something wrong?

627
00:28:09,706 --> 00:28:12,165
Honestly, I don't think
that that's any of our business.

628
00:28:12,208 --> 00:28:13,510
Good boy!

629
00:28:13,949 --> 00:28:15,679
You'll talk to her?

630
00:28:17,814 --> 00:28:20,017
This family talks too much.

631
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:22,914
What, did she send you
as her little spy?

632
00:28:24,287 --> 00:28:26,389
Hmm? I mean, have you ever not
done what she asked you to do?

633
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:29,356
Once, but... it was a biggie.

634
00:28:29,399 --> 00:28:31,532
Free spritz!
It's now or never, ladies...!

635
00:28:31,762 --> 00:28:34,056
Is it something between you and Rob?

636
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:36,276
Okay, fine! I'm
going on my break! It's never!

637
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:38,669
I can't... I can't
talk to you about this.

638
00:28:38,713 --> 00:28:39,670
Okay.

639
00:28:39,714 --> 00:28:40,671
Hel-lo!

640
00:28:40,715 --> 00:28:41,672
Hello.

641
00:28:41,716 --> 00:28:43,674
Aren't you supposed
to be out on the floor?

642
00:28:43,718 --> 00:28:45,937
Oh, bosslady, don't go there.

643
00:28:45,981 --> 00:28:46,938
I need my caffeine.

644
00:28:46,982 --> 00:28:48,070
- Hi.
- Hi.

645
00:28:48,114 --> 00:28:50,246
I'm David, Suzanne's brother.

646
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:51,247
Oh. Well, I could tell.

647
00:28:51,291 --> 00:28:52,770
- Yeah?
- Well, sure.

648
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:53,771
How?

649
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:55,425
You have the same smile.

650
00:28:55,469 --> 00:28:58,037
Well, not at the moment, but... oh.

651
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,734
I'm the postman now.

652
00:28:59,777 --> 00:29:01,040
Well, nice meeting you.

653
00:29:01,083 --> 00:29:02,041
Bye-bye.

654
00:29:02,084 --> 00:29:04,086
So, gee, do you think Brandon's gay?

655
00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:06,436
Would you please just go away? Just...

656
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,569
You... you failed your mission.
I didn't crack.

657
00:29:08,612 --> 00:29:09,570
- All right.
- All right?

658
00:29:09,613 --> 00:29:10,571
I'm going.

659
00:29:10,614 --> 00:29:11,572
Now? Soon?

660
00:29:11,615 --> 00:29:14,444
Listen, it's your life,
and we should all butt out.

661
00:29:14,488 --> 00:29:15,445
I understand.

662
00:29:15,489 --> 00:29:17,447
But, you know, every time you get upset,

663
00:29:17,491 --> 00:29:21,103
it's because you don't deal
with what's bothering you.

664
00:29:21,147 --> 00:29:23,580
Don't pretend that everything's okay.

665
00:29:26,516 --> 00:29:29,619
Can we pretend like we never heard this?

666
00:29:30,025 --> 00:29:31,621
Can you?

667
00:29:34,508 --> 00:29:37,467
No.

668
00:29:43,734 --> 00:29:46,002
We could get rid of it.

669
00:29:48,696 --> 00:29:50,707
We could.

670
00:29:53,048 --> 00:29:56,224
I mean, I never thought I would
have to do something like that.

671
00:29:56,356 --> 00:29:59,837
Ah, we don't have to decide right away.

672
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:02,840
No, of course not.

673
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:04,146
But...

674
00:30:04,190 --> 00:30:07,584
You can't take too much time
if you make that decision.

675
00:30:18,268 --> 00:30:20,684
I wish it were deformed.

676
00:30:20,728 --> 00:30:22,033
Suzanne!

677
00:30:22,077 --> 00:30:24,688
It's just that it wouldn't
be so complicated, that's all.

678
00:30:24,732 --> 00:30:26,676
It's just so complicated.

679
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:45,729
Mom, say something.

680
00:30:47,581 --> 00:30:51,889
Well, you know,
it's not such a terrible thing,

681
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:55,739
when you think of what they
could have told you, you know?

682
00:30:57,765 --> 00:30:59,375
Here, sit down.

683
00:30:59,419 --> 00:31:01,445
Have some tea. Right here.

684
00:31:08,602 --> 00:31:11,605
You're not thinking of, uh...

685
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:16,218
Oh, Susie...

686
00:31:16,262 --> 00:31:18,960
Don't look so sad.

687
00:31:19,003 --> 00:31:21,098
I don't know what to do.

688
00:31:23,269 --> 00:31:25,227
Maybe that makes me a horrible person.

689
00:31:25,271 --> 00:31:28,404
No! No! It doesn't!

690
00:31:31,799 --> 00:31:33,276
No, honey! Shh, shh, shh...!

691
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:39,110
No, listen to me.

692
00:31:39,154 --> 00:31:40,111
Now, listen to me.

693
00:31:40,155 --> 00:31:42,418
What does Rob say?

694
00:31:42,462 --> 00:31:44,115
What does he say?

695
00:31:44,354 --> 00:31:47,024
He wanted this baby so badly.

696
00:31:50,165 --> 00:31:53,124
Yeah. Yeah.

697
00:31:53,168 --> 00:31:54,952
And, uh...

698
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:57,259
Does David know?

699
00:31:58,101 --> 00:31:59,435
Are you crazy?

700
00:31:59,479 --> 00:32:00,958
What?

701
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:03,396
And I don't want him
to find out, either.

702
00:32:03,439 --> 00:32:04,397
Is that clear?

703
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:06,743
Yeah, sure, sure.

704
00:32:07,177 --> 00:32:08,912
Yeah, that's clear.

705
00:32:13,188 --> 00:32:15,146
Why did they have to tell you, huh?

706
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:18,488
I mean, years ago, you go in the
hospital, they put you out...

707
00:32:18,555 --> 00:32:20,390
Tell me what to do.

708
00:32:21,805 --> 00:32:24,808
Tell me what to do.

709
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:40,998
It's all right.

710
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:43,044
You're gonna find
you're gonna be all right.

711
00:32:43,087 --> 00:32:45,348
We'll... we'll work this out.

712
00:33:07,721 --> 00:33:10,332
Hi. What a day,

713
00:33:10,376 --> 00:33:12,542
but I made a few dollars.

714
00:33:13,553 --> 00:33:17,339
They got the tests back from the lab.

715
00:33:17,383 --> 00:33:19,689
What?

716
00:33:19,733 --> 00:33:23,653
Please don't be dramatic,
Phyllis. Spit it out.

717
00:33:25,389 --> 00:33:27,257
It's gay.

718
00:33:30,527 --> 00:33:33,224
That's ridiculous.
Are... are they sure?

719
00:33:33,397 --> 00:33:35,226
Well, they're doctors.

720
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:38,229
They never say they're sure, they
just tell you enough to destroy you.

721
00:33:38,435 --> 00:33:40,231
But how could they possibly...?

722
00:33:40,275 --> 00:33:43,373
They say they can identify the genes
that have some connection with this.

723
00:33:43,507 --> 00:33:45,236
I don't want to hear about this.

724
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:47,282
Rob says there have been studies...

725
00:33:47,326 --> 00:33:49,284
When do we eat?
I am starving!

726
00:33:49,328 --> 00:33:50,285
She was here.

727
00:33:50,329 --> 00:33:51,286
She's thinking...

728
00:33:51,330 --> 00:33:52,374
It's none of our business.

729
00:33:52,418 --> 00:33:53,723
Suzanne was here today,

730
00:33:53,767 --> 00:33:55,725
and... and she... Walter!

731
00:33:56,053 --> 00:33:57,320
What?

732
00:33:58,598 --> 00:34:01,862
She might not keep it.

733
00:34:03,951 --> 00:34:04,995
You with the money again.

734
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:07,730
The Grant proposals are in, but there's
something that we need to talk about.

735
00:34:07,731 --> 00:34:10,261
- What?
- Is there going to be a meal break?

736
00:34:10,305 --> 00:34:13,352
A meal break? What, like,
brunnhilde burgers or something?

737
00:34:13,395 --> 00:34:17,073
"Why must we waste our hunger
on food?" Who said that?

738
00:34:17,074 --> 00:34:19,096
- Karen Carpenter.
- Minnie Kahnertovsky.

739
00:34:19,309 --> 00:34:22,057
Listen, who's gonna sit for
seven hours without a meal break?

740
00:34:22,186 --> 00:34:24,714
- Six and three quarters, right?
- It'll be longer by then.

741
00:34:24,715 --> 00:34:26,717
I'm working on a corporate
tie-in with burger king.

742
00:34:26,783 --> 00:34:27,951
Burger king?

743
00:34:28,018 --> 00:34:29,486
I've got a connection at Blimpie...?

744
00:34:29,519 --> 00:34:31,326
What is the point?

745
00:34:31,370 --> 00:34:32,327
Where are we?

746
00:34:32,371 --> 00:34:35,765
Some sort of remedial course
for generation-x whiners?

747
00:34:35,809 --> 00:34:36,766
This is the ring.

748
00:34:36,810 --> 00:34:38,551
This is an opera.

749
00:34:38,594 --> 00:34:39,552
This is about us.

750
00:34:39,595 --> 00:34:41,075
It's about heroism.

751
00:34:41,118 --> 00:34:43,382
It's about being separated
from your parents, your family,

752
00:34:43,425 --> 00:34:44,383
your loved ones, god.

753
00:34:44,426 --> 00:34:46,385
It's about what people do
to figure out who they are

754
00:34:46,428 --> 00:34:48,905
so that they can change the world,
and that's what we're going to do.

755
00:34:48,972 --> 00:34:52,782
Do not fear, children,
Randy is here! Sorry I'm late!

756
00:34:52,826 --> 00:34:54,131
My casting director supreme.

757
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:56,133
Yes, our Benetton ad is complete.

758
00:34:56,177 --> 00:34:58,135
So, tell me, did you find Siegfried?

759
00:34:58,179 --> 00:34:59,136
Okay, here it is.

760
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:01,817
I've been through every music
school and church choir

761
00:35:01,818 --> 00:35:04,272
in the city. Nobody can sing this
Nazi shit anymore, I'm telling you.

762
00:35:04,315 --> 00:35:06,274
I know. But did you find me a siegfried?

763
00:35:06,317 --> 00:35:07,275
Okay, point taken.

764
00:35:07,318 --> 00:35:09,277
- You'll keep looking?
- I will. I'm sorry.

765
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:11,327
He's beautiful. Nature's child.

766
00:35:11,328 --> 00:35:13,195
- You got it.
- An underwear model who sings.

767
00:35:13,196 --> 00:35:13,803
Ooh! Yes!

768
00:35:13,847 --> 00:35:14,891
Can you find him?

769
00:35:14,935 --> 00:35:16,700
If I can, I'm keeping him.

770
00:35:19,505 --> 00:35:20,462
What?

771
00:35:20,506 --> 00:35:22,172
No group hug?

772
00:35:23,707 --> 00:35:24,901
Here it is.

773
00:35:24,945 --> 00:35:27,469
I'm so glad your mother called me.

774
00:35:27,513 --> 00:35:31,181
Now, this is for a girl,
obviously, but some of it's

775
00:35:31,281 --> 00:35:34,738
unisex. I can't believe you don't want
to find out before. I couldn't wait!

776
00:35:34,868 --> 00:35:36,415
You should go through this stuff.

777
00:35:36,516 --> 00:35:39,927
You can get it back to me before I have
another one... which may be never.

778
00:35:40,924 --> 00:35:43,397
Oh, no, Samantha, no,
let's not pull out the diapers.

779
00:35:43,529 --> 00:35:44,995
Okay, come on here. Let's play.

780
00:35:45,062 --> 00:35:46,429
Where's the fuzzy bunny?

781
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:47,315
Oh, here it is!

782
00:35:48,131 --> 00:35:50,013
You know, actually,
I think I should, um,

783
00:35:50,434 --> 00:35:53,335
I should probably wait
on this stuff. I don't want to...

784
00:35:53,336 --> 00:35:54,757
I don't want to jinx anything.

785
00:35:54,801 --> 00:35:55,758
Oh, poo poo poo.

786
00:35:55,802 --> 00:35:59,935
God forbid. I mean, you should get
everything tested, checked out.

787
00:36:00,067 --> 00:36:01,198
I mean, there's this little boy

788
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:04,981
in Samantha's "mommy and me" class
that has, like, gnarled feet.

789
00:36:05,048 --> 00:36:06,290
He can't really walk!

790
00:36:06,334 --> 00:36:07,640
I mean, you just feel like,

791
00:36:07,683 --> 00:36:11,121
why did they do that to this
sweet little kid, you know?

792
00:36:11,252 --> 00:36:12,688
I would kill myself.

793
00:36:13,256 --> 00:36:15,038
Oh, there's the bunny.

794
00:36:15,625 --> 00:36:16,518
Debbie, I'm sorry.

795
00:36:17,527 --> 00:36:19,869
Um, you know, I'm not...
I'm not feeling very well.

796
00:36:19,913 --> 00:36:20,870
I know how it is.

797
00:36:21,231 --> 00:36:24,308
When I was carrying her,
I used to puke my guts out.

798
00:36:24,352 --> 00:36:26,049
We'll do this another time.

799
00:36:26,093 --> 00:36:27,050
Ready?

800
00:36:27,094 --> 00:36:29,879
Okay, say goodbye to Suzanne.

801
00:36:29,923 --> 00:36:32,795
Notice the food at the club
has been horrible lately?

802
00:36:32,839 --> 00:36:35,045
It's, like, dry and overcooked.

803
00:36:35,178 --> 00:36:36,407
Yeah.

804
00:36:36,451 --> 00:36:40,063
You know, I'm really sorry
about this. I just...

805
00:36:40,107 --> 00:36:43,220
You know, it was really
nice of you to come by.

806
00:36:43,763 --> 00:36:47,070
Hey, you know, I really
know how you're feeling.

807
00:36:47,257 --> 00:36:49,760
I mean, when I found out I was pregnant,

808
00:36:49,826 --> 00:36:52,795
I, like, panicked.
I mean, how are we gonna afford it?

809
00:36:52,796 --> 00:36:55,557
How am I gonna
handle the responsibility?

810
00:36:55,601 --> 00:36:57,733
But, you know...

811
00:36:57,777 --> 00:36:59,735
it's really worth it.

812
00:37:08,135 --> 00:37:10,713
Sweetheart, I can't tell you what to do.

813
00:37:10,714 --> 00:37:12,487
You're... you're a grown woman!

814
00:37:12,531 --> 00:37:14,489
All I want for you is that you're happy.

815
00:37:14,533 --> 00:37:15,577
That's all.

816
00:37:15,621 --> 00:37:17,057
You make it sound so easy.

817
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:19,102
Oh, I'm not.

818
00:37:19,146 --> 00:37:20,756
When David was...

819
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:24,107
was in college, his sophomore year,

820
00:37:24,327 --> 00:37:26,457
his... his boyfriend...

821
00:37:26,501 --> 00:37:29,591
whatever... dumped him.

822
00:37:29,635 --> 00:37:30,897
Broke up with him.

823
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:32,768
David was very, very upset.

824
00:37:32,812 --> 00:37:33,769
Bradley?

825
00:37:33,813 --> 00:37:35,728
Yes, Bradley. Bradley.

826
00:37:35,771 --> 00:37:38,295
And, uh, David called us,

827
00:37:38,575 --> 00:37:41,951
and... and said he wanted to...

828
00:37:41,995 --> 00:37:45,346
He said he wanted to come home
so we could cheer him up

829
00:37:45,389 --> 00:37:47,391
and make him feel better

830
00:37:47,551 --> 00:37:49,986
and get him through it all.

831
00:37:51,526 --> 00:37:54,311
And I told him no,

832
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:56,879
that he'd have to get
through it on his own.

833
00:37:56,923 --> 00:37:58,272
And what did mom say?

834
00:37:58,315 --> 00:38:00,796
Mom said it was my decision.

835
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:03,146
She was relieved, but...

836
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:05,714
I was holding the phone and listening...

837
00:38:05,758 --> 00:38:09,152
to my son cry, and...

838
00:38:09,196 --> 00:38:11,742
there was nothing I could do.

839
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:17,080
It made me sick, it really did.
It made me sick.

840
00:38:19,216 --> 00:38:21,251
There's nothing we can do.

841
00:38:22,862 --> 00:38:25,995
When my son needed me the most,

842
00:38:26,790 --> 00:38:31,174
I wasn't... I wasn't there for him.

843
00:38:31,218 --> 00:38:33,530
I wasn't there.

844
00:38:36,223 --> 00:38:38,301
What if I...

845
00:38:39,052 --> 00:38:41,010
decide to have it, hm?

846
00:38:41,054 --> 00:38:42,406
I mean, it'll be your grandkid.

847
00:38:42,506 --> 00:38:47,016
Sure. You... you always
love your own family,

848
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:49,579
even with all the crap!

849
00:38:50,716 --> 00:38:52,674
I mean, I love you and David so much,

850
00:38:52,718 --> 00:38:55,024
I just... I want to burst.

851
00:38:55,068 --> 00:38:59,156
I'm so happy that you're my daughter.

852
00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:05,948
But if you and Rob have a chance
to avoid some of the crap,

853
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:08,165
why not take it?

854
00:39:21,845 --> 00:39:23,313
Yes?

855
00:39:24,147 --> 00:39:25,011
On the counter?

856
00:39:25,054 --> 00:39:28,217
The satchel and the leather
and the wet and the rain?

857
00:39:28,218 --> 00:39:29,251
Thanks a lot, darling.

858
00:39:29,252 --> 00:39:33,019
I made blintzes on Sunday,
and I saved you some.

859
00:39:33,062 --> 00:39:35,717
They're your favorites, right?

860
00:39:35,761 --> 00:39:36,718
Okay.

861
00:39:37,394 --> 00:39:41,897
I... I just have something
I want to talk to you about, okay?

862
00:39:41,941 --> 00:39:43,725
All right.

863
00:39:44,034 --> 00:39:47,938
Your father will be home
from work soon.

864
00:39:50,123 --> 00:39:51,080
Get you a fork.

865
00:39:51,208 --> 00:39:53,110
Okay, there you go.

866
00:39:54,211 --> 00:39:55,645
Now, what is it?

867
00:39:57,130 --> 00:40:00,384
Well, I, uh...

868
00:40:01,787 --> 00:40:05,616
I went to see my cousin,

869
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:07,224
Gloria Myers.

870
00:40:07,724 --> 00:40:09,838
I don't remember her.

871
00:40:09,882 --> 00:40:12,841
I haven't seen her
since you were a little boy.

872
00:40:12,885 --> 00:40:14,843
Uh, you know, we used to be close.

873
00:40:16,671 --> 00:40:21,196
All these years,
I told myself we grew apart.

874
00:40:25,308 --> 00:40:27,177
That wasn't it.

875
00:40:30,163 --> 00:40:31,947
That wasn't it.

876
00:40:31,991 --> 00:40:33,450
I dropped her.

877
00:40:35,995 --> 00:40:38,622
I saw her mother die
in the most awful way...

878
00:40:38,689 --> 00:40:41,691
spasms, and uncontrollable
Huntington's disease.

879
00:40:41,692 --> 00:40:42,693
It's genetic.

880
00:40:42,793 --> 00:40:45,308
Not on our side of the family,
thank god.

881
00:40:45,529 --> 00:40:48,231
But I knew someday Gloria...

882
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:51,234
Gloria might get it too.

883
00:40:52,533 --> 00:40:56,667
I might have to go through it with her.

884
00:40:56,711 --> 00:40:59,322
I was afraid that...

885
00:41:00,277 --> 00:41:01,890
I wasn't strong enough.

886
00:41:01,934 --> 00:41:04,214
Oh, no.

887
00:41:06,721 --> 00:41:08,157
So...

888
00:41:08,201 --> 00:41:12,595
I'm afraid that Suzanne might
make the same mistake...

889
00:41:12,923 --> 00:41:13,390
Wait.

890
00:41:13,457 --> 00:41:14,685
...and never know it.

891
00:41:14,729 --> 00:41:16,126
What are you saying?

892
00:41:17,627 --> 00:41:21,170
Is... is there something
wrong with the baby... mom?

893
00:41:21,214 --> 00:41:23,825
Well... there's a problem.

894
00:41:25,369 --> 00:41:28,873
What? Did she miscarry or something?
Nobody's told me anything.

895
00:41:29,004 --> 00:41:31,746
Yeah, I can't say.
I'm not supposed to say.

896
00:41:31,790 --> 00:41:33,110
Suzanne would kill me!

897
00:41:33,276 --> 00:41:35,411
I'm gonna call her
right now if you don't tell me.

898
00:41:35,412 --> 00:41:36,011
Don't do that.

899
00:41:36,055 --> 00:41:38,148
She may not keep it.

900
00:41:43,553 --> 00:41:47,370
She went to the lab,
and the did that test, you know?

901
00:41:47,414 --> 00:41:48,545
Rob took her.

902
00:41:48,825 --> 00:41:50,027
And?

903
00:41:52,662 --> 00:41:54,164
What?

904
00:41:54,698 --> 00:41:56,933
It's gonna be like you.

905
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:18,855
David...

906
00:42:19,022 --> 00:42:20,534
I had to tell you, David.

907
00:42:20,577 --> 00:42:22,726
That's why I called.

908
00:42:23,093 --> 00:42:25,362
Here. Come on.

909
00:42:26,453 --> 00:42:29,238
What would you have done...

910
00:42:29,282 --> 00:42:31,001
If you had known?

911
00:42:33,870 --> 00:42:37,856
It was... a different time,
you know? Different...

912
00:42:37,899 --> 00:42:39,076
Different attitudes.

913
00:42:39,109 --> 00:42:40,844
Not so different.

914
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:43,600
David, you...

915
00:42:43,644 --> 00:42:46,429
No, David, we love you.

916
00:42:46,473 --> 00:42:48,127
Oh, god.

917
00:42:48,170 --> 00:42:50,987
You were always a joy.

918
00:42:51,957 --> 00:42:54,785
Window's down on my car.

919
00:42:54,829 --> 00:42:56,744
I told you a million times,

920
00:42:56,787 --> 00:42:59,921
the delivery was a breeze, huh?

921
00:42:59,965 --> 00:43:03,011
You came out singing and dancing.

922
00:43:03,367 --> 00:43:05,927
That's why you can't
talk to her yourself,

923
00:43:05,971 --> 00:43:06,703
'cause...

924
00:43:06,770 --> 00:43:09,806
- No, wait...
- ...you would have done the same thing.

925
00:43:10,976 --> 00:43:12,242
You would have killed me.

926
00:43:12,978 --> 00:43:14,478
You stop that.

927
00:43:15,212 --> 00:43:16,780
You stop that.

928
00:43:17,581 --> 00:43:20,282
I raised you!
I wiped your tush!

929
00:43:20,283 --> 00:43:22,585
Then tell Suzanne to keep the baby.

930
00:43:22,586 --> 00:43:23,597
I can't!

931
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:26,469
She knows what I've been
through with you!

932
00:43:26,656 --> 00:43:29,226
What have you "been through" with me?

933
00:43:30,794 --> 00:43:33,530
I saw my son...

934
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:38,035
become something...

935
00:43:39,169 --> 00:43:40,904
different.

936
00:43:42,137 --> 00:43:44,400
That hurts, David.

937
00:43:44,841 --> 00:43:48,078
If you were a parent, you'd understand.

938
00:43:50,189 --> 00:43:52,516
This isn't what I wanted for you.

939
00:43:53,714 --> 00:43:55,185
Well, get over it!

940
00:43:55,819 --> 00:43:56,853
I can't?

941
00:43:57,020 --> 00:43:58,980
Oh, you could,
but you just don't want to,

942
00:43:59,024 --> 00:44:01,852
so what you're doing
is you're letting her kill me.

943
00:44:02,059 --> 00:44:03,680
You're killing me!

944
00:44:03,724 --> 00:44:04,855
No, I'm not! I'm not, David!

945
00:44:04,899 --> 00:44:05,996
Yes, you are!

946
00:44:06,163 --> 00:44:08,337
There's no difference. It's the sa...

947
00:44:08,532 --> 00:44:12,302
First it's raining,
then it's not raining.

948
00:44:12,472 --> 00:44:13,429
Hello, sweetheart.

949
00:44:13,473 --> 00:44:14,430
Hello!

950
00:44:14,474 --> 00:44:15,431
I'm home.

951
00:44:15,475 --> 00:44:16,432
What's happening?

952
00:44:16,476 --> 00:44:18,434
We're having dinner in the garage?

953
00:44:18,478 --> 00:44:21,611
Hey, Mr. Mini ring,
should I get out my checkbook?

954
00:44:21,829 --> 00:44:23,874
Mom told me about Suzanne.

955
00:44:25,182 --> 00:44:27,116
I thought she told you
not to say anything.

956
00:44:27,117 --> 00:44:28,451
I had to. It wasn't right.

957
00:44:28,452 --> 00:44:30,453
He's part of the family, he has to know.

958
00:44:30,454 --> 00:44:32,356
All right, he knows.

959
00:44:32,656 --> 00:44:33,536
So what? He knows.

960
00:44:33,580 --> 00:44:38,019
But it's still...
it's Rob and Suzanne's decision.

961
00:44:38,063 --> 00:44:40,891
If you got married and you had a family,

962
00:44:40,935 --> 00:44:43,894
then it would be your decision.

963
00:44:43,938 --> 00:44:47,236
We are liberal people, David,
maybe too much so some...

964
00:44:47,237 --> 00:44:48,377
Watch. That's wet.

965
00:44:48,421 --> 00:44:49,770
I like it wet.

966
00:44:49,813 --> 00:44:51,728
What would you have done?

967
00:44:51,772 --> 00:44:53,034
He wants to know what...

968
00:44:53,078 --> 00:44:54,731
if we had known...

969
00:44:54,775 --> 00:44:57,212
What nonsense! We didn't know!

970
00:44:57,256 --> 00:44:58,822
You know this garage is a mess!

971
00:44:58,866 --> 00:44:59,823
Goddamn it!

972
00:44:59,867 --> 00:45:03,827
Why is it so hard for you people
to just answer me?!

973
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:05,394
What would you have done?!

974
00:45:05,956 --> 00:45:09,050
For a smart kid, David,
you're a little stupid sometimes.

975
00:45:09,094 --> 00:45:09,893
Walter, please.

976
00:45:10,694 --> 00:45:12,575
Why do you want to do this, huh, David?

977
00:45:12,619 --> 00:45:15,926
I think that I have a right to know.

978
00:45:15,970 --> 00:45:17,406
A right?!

979
00:45:17,450 --> 00:45:18,755
The nerve! A right!

980
00:45:18,799 --> 00:45:22,063
Since you were a little kid,
we gave you everything you ever wanted.

981
00:45:22,107 --> 00:45:24,239
You have no more rights!

982
00:45:25,042 --> 00:45:26,676
Boys, you're fighting over nothing.

983
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:28,026
No, we're not. No, we're not.

984
00:45:28,178 --> 00:45:31,615
You're just upset because you
don't know how I feel inside.

985
00:45:31,748 --> 00:45:33,161
Well, tough.

986
00:45:34,017 --> 00:45:35,772
I don't know how I feel inside.

987
00:45:35,919 --> 00:45:36,887
Bullshit, Walter!

988
00:45:36,953 --> 00:45:38,722
You know exactly how you feel!

989
00:45:38,755 --> 00:45:41,525
You just don't have the guts to tell me!

990
00:45:42,170 --> 00:45:45,173
All right. All right!

991
00:45:48,350 --> 00:45:50,831
You want the truth, you got it!

992
00:45:50,874 --> 00:45:53,486
The answer is, who knows?

993
00:45:53,529 --> 00:45:56,489
Maybe you would be here,
and maybe you would not be here.

994
00:45:56,740 --> 00:45:59,622
Maybe Suzanne would be an only child.

995
00:45:59,666 --> 00:46:03,844
Maybe we wouldn't have to think about
the things that you make us think about.

996
00:46:04,181 --> 00:46:06,847
And how do I really feel?

997
00:46:07,150 --> 00:46:08,719
I'll tell you.

998
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:12,548
I think you're sick and diseased,

999
00:46:12,923 --> 00:46:15,959
and if there were a cure,
I'd want you cured.

1000
00:46:17,994 --> 00:46:20,864
That's how I really feel.

1001
00:46:23,951 --> 00:46:25,735
David!

1002
00:46:26,236 --> 00:46:28,521
And even though your mother
wouldn't admit it,

1003
00:46:28,564 --> 00:46:30,523
deep down she feels the same way too!

1004
00:46:30,566 --> 00:46:31,524
Don't you speak for me!

1005
00:46:31,567 --> 00:46:33,076
Listen to me...

1006
00:46:33,110 --> 00:46:35,846
David! David!

1007
00:46:37,095 --> 00:46:38,879
David, David.

1008
00:46:38,922 --> 00:46:41,447
- ¡David!
- David, David, listen to me.

1009
00:46:41,490 --> 00:46:42,970
Nothing has changed.

1010
00:46:43,013 --> 00:46:43,971
David... David, look at me.

1011
00:46:44,014 --> 00:46:45,668
Please, please.

1012
00:46:45,712 --> 00:46:47,540
You are our only son...

1013
00:46:47,583 --> 00:46:49,063
David!

1014
00:46:49,107 --> 00:46:50,717
...and we love you.

1015
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:54,068
We always have, and we always will.

1016
00:46:54,431 --> 00:46:56,070
Do you understand
what I'm saying, David?

1017
00:46:56,114 --> 00:46:58,072
He doesn't mean any of
that that he said!

1018
00:46:58,869 --> 00:47:00,727
Please, Phyllis.
He... he can handle it.

1019
00:47:00,770 --> 00:47:02,598
He... he's... he's a man.

1020
00:47:02,642 --> 00:47:03,599
He's tough.

1021
00:47:03,643 --> 00:47:06,385
I'm getting tougher by the minute.

1022
00:47:06,428 --> 00:47:07,473
Attaboy.

1023
00:47:07,516 --> 00:47:10,040
Listen, mister,
how 'bout a little money...?

1024
00:47:10,084 --> 00:47:12,042
I don't need any money, thank you.

1025
00:47:12,086 --> 00:47:13,417
Would you want to take something?

1026
00:47:13,483 --> 00:47:15,133
No, I don't need anything.

1027
00:47:15,176 --> 00:47:15,819
Some food?

1028
00:47:15,886 --> 00:47:17,621
No, I'm fine.

1029
00:47:21,258 --> 00:47:24,094
Oh, David! Dav...!

1030
00:47:51,555 --> 00:47:53,990
David, look, I know I should
probably get all militant

1031
00:47:54,024 --> 00:47:56,692
and say right on, hell with
your parents, who needs 'em?

1032
00:47:56,693 --> 00:47:57,461
But you love 'em.

1033
00:47:58,395 --> 00:47:59,786
Doesn't have to end this way.

1034
00:47:59,829 --> 00:48:01,266
I know how they feel now.

1035
00:48:01,309 --> 00:48:03,268
It's just the way it is.

1036
00:48:03,311 --> 00:48:05,270
All right, well, what about Suzanne?

1037
00:48:05,313 --> 00:48:07,141
I'm not supposed to know.

1038
00:48:07,185 --> 00:48:08,142
Oh, Jesus Christ.

1039
00:48:08,186 --> 00:48:10,623
Your family sure picked
a great time to stop meddling.

1040
00:48:10,666 --> 00:48:11,972
What should I do?

1041
00:48:12,015 --> 00:48:12,973
You gotta stop her.

1042
00:48:13,643 --> 00:48:14,627
You gotta tell her she's wrong.

1043
00:48:14,670 --> 00:48:15,746
Oh, stop it, please.

1044
00:48:15,812 --> 00:48:17,978
Come on, you're more pro-choice
than I am.

1045
00:48:18,181 --> 00:48:22,619
David, come on, this is
different, and you know it.

1046
00:48:23,462 --> 00:48:26,595
Why are you being so reluctant?
Is this because you think she's right...

1047
00:48:26,639 --> 00:48:28,491
maybe the kid's gonna be
better off dead?

1048
00:48:28,492 --> 00:48:29,492
Stop it.

1049
00:48:29,493 --> 00:48:31,895
Are you still ashamed of who you are?

1050
00:48:32,896 --> 00:48:34,498
'Cause if so...

1051
00:48:36,039 --> 00:48:38,034
I'd like to know what the fuck
you're doing here.

1052
00:48:38,035 --> 00:48:38,969
Steven...

1053
00:48:40,218 --> 00:48:42,307
I love you.

1054
00:48:42,350 --> 00:48:44,265
This isn't easy.

1055
00:48:44,309 --> 00:48:46,876
When Suzanne brought Rob
home for the first time,

1056
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:49,314
they took him out to brunch
on Sunday, they took him

1057
00:48:49,357 --> 00:48:52,186
to a show, they took him to the club.

1058
00:48:52,230 --> 00:48:55,185
And the only thing I could think was,
they'll never be this happy for me.

1059
00:48:55,285 --> 00:48:58,889
And now I'm supposed to fight so that
some kid can feel the same way? Forget it.

1060
00:49:00,542 --> 00:49:03,093
And besides...

1061
00:49:03,241 --> 00:49:05,678
Am I so great?

1062
00:49:05,721 --> 00:49:08,065
Should there really be
more of me in the world?

1063
00:49:09,899 --> 00:49:11,435
I think so.

1064
00:49:14,077 --> 00:49:15,772
I love you.

1065
00:49:21,737 --> 00:49:22,695
I'll see you tonight.

1066
00:49:22,738 --> 00:49:24,114
Quit hitting me.

1067
00:49:26,742 --> 00:49:28,552
I need a shower.

1068
00:49:32,922 --> 00:49:34,424
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

1069
00:49:40,408 --> 00:49:42,715
Oh. I guess the spring formals arrived.

1070
00:49:42,758 --> 00:49:44,020
They've arrived.

1071
00:49:44,064 --> 00:49:45,370
And they're hideous.

1072
00:49:45,413 --> 00:49:47,241
Oh, Suze, will ya look at 'em?

1073
00:49:47,285 --> 00:49:49,722
They're like drag from hell!

1074
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:53,073
Why does everything have
to go wrong today?

1075
00:49:53,210 --> 00:49:54,911
Jackie, what's the matter with you?

1076
00:49:54,945 --> 00:49:55,979
Nothing's the matter.

1077
00:49:56,012 --> 00:49:57,556
Nothing's the matter, I'm fine.

1078
00:49:57,714 --> 00:49:58,915
I'm fine!

1079
00:49:59,732 --> 00:50:02,285
Okay. Brian and I broke up last night.

1080
00:50:02,517 --> 00:50:03,475
- Really?
- Yeah.

1081
00:50:03,518 --> 00:50:04,476
I'm sorry.

1082
00:50:04,519 --> 00:50:05,912
Don't be. He's a jerk.

1083
00:50:05,955 --> 00:50:08,262
He is. He's a jerk.
I called the cops on him.

1084
00:50:08,306 --> 00:50:09,263
You didn't!

1085
00:50:09,307 --> 00:50:11,309
I did too. I said
he was a prowler, you know,

1086
00:50:11,352 --> 00:50:13,795
but they didn't believe me
because he had keys to the house,

1087
00:50:13,896 --> 00:50:15,197
and all his clothes were in there.

1088
00:50:15,198 --> 00:50:16,633
I wasn't really thinking.

1089
00:50:16,733 --> 00:50:18,403
Now I have to call this schmuck

1090
00:50:18,446 --> 00:50:22,581
and tell him that I don't want
his piece-of-taffeta-puke gowns.

1091
00:50:22,873 --> 00:50:24,908
Oy! What a day.
Give me the phone, please.

1092
00:50:25,008 --> 00:50:26,043
I'll call.

1093
00:50:26,076 --> 00:50:26,676
Excuse me?

1094
00:50:26,743 --> 00:50:28,761
No, give it to me. I'll call.

1095
00:50:28,979 --> 00:50:30,197
Oh, well, Suze, it's...

1096
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:32,082
Give it to me. I'll call.

1097
00:50:34,651 --> 00:50:35,851
You know...

1098
00:50:35,852 --> 00:50:36,943
Just... I'm gon'...

1099
00:50:36,986 --> 00:50:40,730
No, it's fine, but I'm just saying that
sometimes you have to be a little bit...

1100
00:50:40,860 --> 00:50:41,817
You know...

1101
00:50:41,861 --> 00:50:45,430
More... uh, no. Okay.

1102
00:50:45,473 --> 00:50:47,127
Marty.

1103
00:50:47,170 --> 00:50:48,607
Yes, we got the gowns in.

1104
00:50:48,650 --> 00:50:49,608
And we hate them.

1105
00:50:49,651 --> 00:50:51,610
And I need for you to take them back.

1106
00:50:51,653 --> 00:50:52,611
All of them.

1107
00:50:52,654 --> 00:50:53,960
She's so cool. You're very cool.

1108
00:50:54,304 --> 00:50:57,340
Marty, you cannot force me to accept
merchandise that I don't want.

1109
00:50:57,374 --> 00:50:59,487
Exactly. That's in some
rulebook somewhere.

1110
00:50:59,531 --> 00:51:01,282
No, there's nothing wrong
with them, technically,

1111
00:51:01,383 --> 00:51:02,578
but they're just not what I ordered.

1112
00:51:02,579 --> 00:51:04,880
They're disgusting.
That could be something wrong.

1113
00:51:04,881 --> 00:51:06,799
I'm not paying. How's that?

1114
00:51:06,842 --> 00:51:08,453
No one's paying.

1115
00:51:08,496 --> 00:51:09,802
So sue me. That's fine.

1116
00:51:09,845 --> 00:51:11,804
Yeah, you pick 'em up
by six tomorrow night

1117
00:51:11,847 --> 00:51:14,067
or they're out in the alley
with the other garbage.

1118
00:51:14,458 --> 00:51:16,660
Yes. Garbage.

1119
00:51:16,852 --> 00:51:17,810
Marty...

1120
00:51:17,853 --> 00:51:19,830
You say thank you to me.

1121
00:51:21,598 --> 00:51:23,333
You're welcome.

1122
00:51:24,301 --> 00:51:25,502
'Bye.

1123
00:51:26,035 --> 00:51:28,168
Done. Anything else?

1124
00:51:28,338 --> 00:51:31,650
Suze. I am impressed.

1125
00:51:31,693 --> 00:51:34,845
Smooth! Who knew you had it in you?

1126
00:51:34,878 --> 00:51:36,045
That kid better watch out.

1127
00:51:36,089 --> 00:51:38,081
He's got a super tough
mommy, do you know that?

1128
00:51:38,115 --> 00:51:38,949
Really?

1129
00:51:38,982 --> 00:51:40,310
Who knew? I didn't know.

1130
00:51:40,354 --> 00:51:42,008
"Say thank you, Marty"?

1131
00:51:42,219 --> 00:51:44,388
You're getting a promotion,
like it or not.

1132
00:51:47,405 --> 00:51:48,362
What are you doing here?

1133
00:51:48,406 --> 00:51:50,027
- Hi.
- Hi.

1134
00:51:51,028 --> 00:51:52,863
Gift for junior.

1135
00:51:53,541 --> 00:51:56,501
Thanks. Look, I... I have
a lot of stuff on my mind.

1136
00:51:56,544 --> 00:51:57,801
I just want to get home.

1137
00:51:57,834 --> 00:51:58,503
Like what?

1138
00:51:58,546 --> 00:52:00,679
Okay? Um, just stupid stuff.

1139
00:52:00,722 --> 00:52:02,572
No, wait. I got something for you.

1140
00:52:04,808 --> 00:52:06,043
For you.

1141
00:52:07,903 --> 00:52:09,383
Another Sondheim collection?

1142
00:52:09,427 --> 00:52:12,212
- Mm-hmm.
- God, how many of them are there?

1143
00:52:12,616 --> 00:52:14,562
You know, you should really
stop giving us this stuff.

1144
00:52:14,606 --> 00:52:15,868
Nobody ever listens to it.

1145
00:52:15,911 --> 00:52:17,217
It's not for you anymore.

1146
00:52:17,260 --> 00:52:18,871
Well, Rob has no interest.

1147
00:52:19,089 --> 00:52:20,791
Somebody will.

1148
00:52:31,579 --> 00:52:32,537
Mom told you?

1149
00:52:32,580 --> 00:52:33,637
Mm-hmm.

1150
00:52:34,638 --> 00:52:36,440
I can't just sit by and let this happen.

1151
00:52:36,473 --> 00:52:37,542
David...

1152
00:52:37,585 --> 00:52:40,633
David, really,
you have no right to tell me what to do.

1153
00:52:40,762 --> 00:52:43,243
You and Rob wanted this baby,

1154
00:52:43,286 --> 00:52:46,638
and now, because you know something
about this person that you don't care for,

1155
00:52:46,768 --> 00:52:48,074
you're ending his life.

1156
00:52:48,117 --> 00:52:50,187
How can you talk to me like that?

1157
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:53,557
I mean, especially after Marnie Eisner.

1158
00:52:53,657 --> 00:52:54,257
What?

1159
00:52:54,391 --> 00:52:55,734
Marnie Eisner.

1160
00:52:56,026 --> 00:52:57,431
My god.

1161
00:52:57,475 --> 00:53:00,739
I can't believer you're
throwing that in my face!

1162
00:53:00,782 --> 00:53:01,740
Marnie Eisner.

1163
00:53:01,783 --> 00:53:02,741
I was in high school.

1164
00:53:02,784 --> 00:53:03,742
That was... that was a mistake.

1165
00:53:03,785 --> 00:53:06,603
As I recall, you came to me in a panic.

1166
00:53:06,636 --> 00:53:08,094
I couldn't have a child!

1167
00:53:08,372 --> 00:53:10,923
"Oh, my god, Suzanne,
what am I gonna do?"

1168
00:53:10,966 --> 00:53:12,402
That's what you said to me.

1169
00:53:12,446 --> 00:53:13,578
What did I do?

1170
00:53:13,621 --> 00:53:15,754
I took you to the clinic.

1171
00:53:15,797 --> 00:53:19,115
I held your hand, I held her hand.

1172
00:53:19,116 --> 00:53:20,367
- You remember that?
- Yes, I remember that!

1173
00:53:20,410 --> 00:53:23,588
It was a horrible, awful experience, and I
hope I never have to think about it again!

1174
00:53:23,631 --> 00:53:26,523
Do you remember how afraid you were
that mom and dad were gonna find out?

1175
00:53:26,556 --> 00:53:27,853
Now it's what they pray for.

1176
00:53:27,896 --> 00:53:30,116
The point is, I supported you.

1177
00:53:30,159 --> 00:53:31,628
David, I supported you,

1178
00:53:31,661 --> 00:53:33,946
no questions asked.

1179
00:53:34,164 --> 00:53:36,166
Now, I think you should
do the same thing.

1180
00:53:36,199 --> 00:53:38,301
This isn't the same thing.

1181
00:53:39,703 --> 00:53:42,607
This is a decision that
no one has had to make before.

1182
00:53:42,650 --> 00:53:43,707
No one.

1183
00:53:45,523 --> 00:53:47,960
You think I don't know that?

1184
00:53:48,003 --> 00:53:51,704
I mean, this is the most difficult
decision of my entire life,

1185
00:53:51,833 --> 00:53:53,966
and I am being very careful.

1186
00:53:54,084 --> 00:53:56,795
But, David, there are a lot
of things to consider here.

1187
00:53:56,838 --> 00:53:59,589
Like how can you do this to me?

1188
00:54:03,192 --> 00:54:04,150
God, I just...

1189
00:54:04,193 --> 00:54:07,109
I love the way everyone
makes this about them.

1190
00:54:07,631 --> 00:54:09,599
How could you do this to me?

1191
00:54:10,467 --> 00:54:12,569
David, you don't play
these games with me.

1192
00:54:12,769 --> 00:54:14,137
It's not gonna work.

1193
00:55:29,757 --> 00:55:31,214
Take this?

1194
00:55:32,107 --> 00:55:34,981
I still think moving out is just
going a little bit overboard.

1195
00:55:35,110 --> 00:55:37,984
There's no way we can afford this
place, and you know it.

1196
00:55:38,113 --> 00:55:39,419
We don't have enough help.

1197
00:55:39,462 --> 00:55:41,658
Just got another letter from your mom.

1198
00:55:43,393 --> 00:55:44,428
Throw it away.

1199
00:55:44,642 --> 00:55:47,035
You should read, it, David.
It's heartbreaking.

1200
00:55:47,079 --> 00:55:48,733
You read my mail?

1201
00:55:48,776 --> 00:55:51,650
It was addressed to both of us,
which I thought was a very lovely touch.

1202
00:55:52,035 --> 00:55:52,737
I don't want to see it.

1203
00:55:52,936 --> 00:55:55,654
Oh, come on, David,
how long are you gonna keep this up?

1204
00:55:55,783 --> 00:55:56,741
Forever.

1205
00:55:56,784 --> 00:55:59,395
Look, if they don't
want me as their son,

1206
00:55:59,439 --> 00:56:01,920
then I'm going to give them their wish.

1207
00:56:05,314 --> 00:56:06,272
What?

1208
00:56:06,315 --> 00:56:08,840
David, I know you think
you're being all courageous,

1209
00:56:08,883 --> 00:56:11,843
cutting them off
no matter how much it hurts,

1210
00:56:11,886 --> 00:56:14,934
but did you ever think it might be more
courageous to make things right again?

1211
00:56:15,659 --> 00:56:16,456
To forgive 'em?

1212
00:56:16,499 --> 00:56:21,031
I think that we passed that
point around "sick and diseased."

1213
00:56:21,330 --> 00:56:22,288
All right, look.

1214
00:56:22,331 --> 00:56:24,116
Maybe I'll, um...

1215
00:56:24,159 --> 00:56:25,434
I'll do it. I'll write back.

1216
00:56:25,435 --> 00:56:27,206
- No, you won't.
- Somebody's gotta do it.

1217
00:56:27,249 --> 00:56:30,140
No. Don't. Do that.

1218
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:32,124
You should read the letter.
She is in pain.

1219
00:56:32,167 --> 00:56:34,300
I mean it, I mean it. No.

1220
00:56:34,343 --> 00:56:36,279
David, come... David...!

1221
00:56:52,361 --> 00:56:54,494
We're... we're closing now.

1222
00:56:54,537 --> 00:56:55,974
What are you doing here?

1223
00:56:56,017 --> 00:56:57,633
That seems to be the question.

1224
00:56:57,634 --> 00:57:00,195
What if Michelangelo's mother thought
the same way that you do?

1225
00:57:00,239 --> 00:57:02,371
What if Tennessee Williams'
mother thought the same way

1226
00:57:02,415 --> 00:57:05,547
that you do, or Herman melville,
Cole Porter, martina navratilova?

1227
00:57:05,679 --> 00:57:08,594
What if Stephen Hawking's mother
didn't want a handicapped child?

1228
00:57:08,726 --> 00:57:10,480
They didn't know.
This is all theory.

1229
00:57:10,514 --> 00:57:12,548
Orson Welles' didn't want
a fat one. The point is,

1230
00:57:12,549 --> 00:57:15,341
you have got to stop looking
at this as some sort of curse.

1231
00:57:15,384 --> 00:57:18,170
It isn't. What it is, is a challenge.

1232
00:57:18,213 --> 00:57:20,215
I don't have the strength for it.

1233
00:57:20,259 --> 00:57:22,459
I wish that I were as strong
as you are, but I'm not.

1234
00:57:22,492 --> 00:57:23,218
Yes, you are. You are.

1235
00:57:23,262 --> 00:57:26,831
But you just haven't found it yet
'cause you haven't had any reason to.

1236
00:57:26,961 --> 00:57:29,007
You could live the life
that we were programmed for.

1237
00:57:29,050 --> 00:57:31,009
I couldn't, and I had
to figure that out.

1238
00:57:31,052 --> 00:57:32,010
That was my gift.

1239
00:57:32,402 --> 00:57:33,970
Maybe this is yours.

1240
00:57:36,057 --> 00:57:38,103
Maybe this is yours.

1241
00:57:38,146 --> 00:57:39,844
This is your chance...

1242
00:57:39,887 --> 00:57:41,846
your chance to find your own greatness.

1243
00:57:41,889 --> 00:57:43,412
Oh! You are not being fair.

1244
00:57:43,413 --> 00:57:44,114
Neither are you.

1245
00:57:44,115 --> 00:57:46,024
Look, David, I know
how hard your life has been.

1246
00:57:46,067 --> 00:57:48,517
I've heard you tell me
how lonely and scared you were.

1247
00:57:48,518 --> 00:57:49,585
And you never feel that way.

1248
00:57:49,586 --> 00:57:52,379
I've heard you talk about people with
aids, about people getting bashed.

1249
00:57:52,508 --> 00:57:54,510
I'm not gonna put somebody
else through that.

1250
00:57:54,554 --> 00:57:56,034
Everybody has problems.

1251
00:57:56,077 --> 00:57:57,165
Not like that, they don't.

1252
00:57:57,209 --> 00:57:58,950
Now, why isn't it more humane

1253
00:57:58,993 --> 00:58:03,041
for me to wait until I can bring a child
with no disadvantages into the world?

1254
00:58:03,084 --> 00:58:05,102
Because we'd lose too much.

1255
00:58:06,403 --> 00:58:09,773
Everything that you love
about me is tied

1256
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:12,709
to that one element
that makes you queasy.

1257
00:58:13,878 --> 00:58:15,836
Every human being is a tapestry.

1258
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:18,752
If you pull one thread
or one undesirable color,

1259
00:58:18,796 --> 00:58:22,652
then the whole fucking thing falls apart,
and you wind up staring at the walls.

1260
00:58:30,794 --> 00:58:32,462
Suzanne...

1261
00:58:35,595 --> 00:58:37,902
You know, tell him
it's none of his business!

1262
00:58:38,402 --> 00:58:39,904
You know, really, he of all people

1263
00:58:39,947 --> 00:58:42,080
should know how
to respect people's privacy.

1264
00:58:42,123 --> 00:58:44,082
Yeah, well, at least
I know how he feels.

1265
00:58:44,125 --> 00:58:45,083
What?

1266
00:58:45,475 --> 00:58:48,434
Well, at least David tells me
what he thinks. My husband won't.

1267
00:58:48,477 --> 00:58:50,012
What is that supposed...
what are you talking about?

1268
00:58:50,013 --> 00:58:51,213
I tell you how I feel!

1269
00:58:51,214 --> 00:58:53,526
- No, you haven't!
- Yes, I have!

1270
00:58:53,569 --> 00:58:54,527
You just drop hints!

1271
00:58:54,985 --> 00:58:56,752
You know, everybody is
trying to influence me.

1272
00:58:56,753 --> 00:58:58,139
Everybody has their own agenda.

1273
00:58:58,183 --> 00:59:00,141
I'm getting sent all these signals,

1274
00:59:00,185 --> 00:59:02,143
and I still feel like I'm in this alone!

1275
00:59:02,187 --> 00:59:03,318
I'm sorry you feel that way.

1276
00:59:03,362 --> 00:59:05,364
What do you want? I'm here.
I will support you.

1277
00:59:05,407 --> 00:59:07,366
Could you just stop playing this game?

1278
00:59:07,964 --> 00:59:10,151
Just tell me the truth!

1279
00:59:10,195 --> 00:59:12,632
What do you want?

1280
00:59:12,675 --> 00:59:15,287
I think you should do
what you think is right!

1281
00:59:15,330 --> 00:59:17,550
Look, honey, it's hard enough
to raise a family these days.

1282
00:59:17,593 --> 00:59:20,814
Why enter into a no-win situation?

1283
00:59:20,858 --> 00:59:21,946
You're easily disappointed.

1284
00:59:21,989 --> 00:59:24,863
This kid is not gonna feel wanted.
I know how that feels, Suzanne!

1285
00:59:24,992 --> 00:59:26,472
Stop it! Stop it!

1286
00:59:26,515 --> 00:59:27,473
You're doing it again!

1287
00:59:27,516 --> 00:59:28,953
You're making it my problem!

1288
00:59:28,996 --> 00:59:31,956
Stop making it my problem!
Right now!

1289
00:59:31,999 --> 00:59:33,479
I don't want that kid!

1290
00:59:33,522 --> 00:59:36,438
I don't want him!

1291
00:59:43,706 --> 00:59:47,623
I think we should wait for the next one.

1292
00:59:52,890 --> 00:59:53,847
I feel ashamed.

1293
00:59:53,891 --> 00:59:57,852
I feel ashamed of how I feel,
but the idea of a gay kid bothers me.

1294
00:59:57,982 --> 01:00:00,941
Am I horrible person? Am I terrible
for that? I can't help how I feel.

1295
01:00:00,985 --> 01:00:04,254
I can't help how I was raised
or how I think.

1296
01:00:07,491 --> 01:00:09,393
I feel ashamed!

1297
01:00:19,536 --> 01:00:21,238
That's how I feel.

1298
01:00:23,746 --> 01:00:26,643
If I decide to have the baby...

1299
01:00:28,926 --> 01:00:31,381
then what'll happen to us?

1300
01:00:40,938 --> 01:00:43,160
If I decide to have this baby,

1301
01:00:43,226 --> 01:00:45,629
what will happen to us?

1302
01:00:48,075 --> 01:00:50,133
I don't know.

1303
01:01:31,108 --> 01:01:33,677
She's not gonna keep it. It's over.

1304
01:03:01,556 --> 01:03:03,558
The idea of a gay kid bothers me.

1305
01:03:03,602 --> 01:03:05,647
I can't change how I think,
how I feel.

1306
01:03:05,691 --> 01:03:07,214
I don't want it!

1307
01:03:07,258 --> 01:03:08,372
I don't want it!

1308
01:03:08,438 --> 01:03:10,304
I don't want it!

1309
01:03:13,076 --> 01:03:17,414
You know, I'd like you to feel free
to tell me what you're going through.

1310
01:03:17,514 --> 01:03:18,815
I'd like to know.

1311
01:03:21,551 --> 01:03:22,786
Okay.

1312
01:03:23,553 --> 01:03:25,711
I think the test was a mistake.

1313
01:03:25,856 --> 01:03:28,225
Why? Because you didn't like the result?

1314
01:03:29,593 --> 01:03:31,828
This is what we've been
working for. I mean,

1315
01:03:31,895 --> 01:03:33,719
a lot of people would be very happy

1316
01:03:33,762 --> 01:03:36,733
to have this kind of
information ahead of time.

1317
01:03:37,244 --> 01:03:39,135
Well, I think a lot of
people should think twice.

1318
01:03:39,136 --> 01:03:41,248
When it's your own life,
it's not that simple.

1319
01:03:41,292 --> 01:03:44,599
Well, you do some soul-searching,
and then you take the appropriate action.

1320
01:03:44,643 --> 01:03:46,043
That's what I would do.

1321
01:03:46,109 --> 01:03:48,734
You've never been married,
never had children.

1322
01:03:48,777 --> 01:03:50,562
No, but...

1323
01:03:50,605 --> 01:03:51,563
if I did...

1324
01:03:51,606 --> 01:03:52,564
You're so sure?

1325
01:03:52,607 --> 01:03:54,218
Yeah.

1326
01:03:54,261 --> 01:03:56,053
Trust your instincts.

1327
01:03:58,955 --> 01:04:01,921
Suze, I ordered moss,
and I said "moss" two times.

1328
01:04:02,125 --> 01:04:04,576
I spelled it once... "m-o-s-s"...

1329
01:04:04,619 --> 01:04:06,230
and they send me beige.

1330
01:04:06,273 --> 01:04:08,580
Who would ever buy this jacket in beige?

1331
01:04:08,732 --> 01:04:09,833
Is that the baby?

1332
01:04:11,278 --> 01:04:12,236
Can I see?

1333
01:04:12,279 --> 01:04:13,237
Yeah.

1334
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:14,538
Oh, will you...

1335
01:04:14,604 --> 01:04:17,707
Look at him. He is gorgeous.

1336
01:04:17,708 --> 01:04:18,764
Look at the fingers.

1337
01:04:18,807 --> 01:04:22,768
Right here is his cute little
face, cuter than the Gerber baby.

1338
01:04:22,811 --> 01:04:24,770
You could put him on the Pamper box.

1339
01:04:24,813 --> 01:04:26,424
And how bout this?

1340
01:04:26,467 --> 01:04:28,118
That's the best butt I've ever seen.

1341
01:04:28,469 --> 01:04:30,950
Oh, Jackie, stop it.

1342
01:04:30,993 --> 01:04:31,951
I already love him.

1343
01:04:31,994 --> 01:04:33,223
Look at him.

1344
01:04:34,171 --> 01:04:35,292
You know what?

1345
01:04:36,093 --> 01:04:37,427
I want to be you.

1346
01:04:38,028 --> 01:04:39,663
Oh, please.

1347
01:04:40,002 --> 01:04:40,960
I do.

1348
01:04:41,003 --> 01:04:42,232
You are one lucky lady.

1349
01:04:42,265 --> 01:04:44,267
Well, it's complicated.

1350
01:04:44,572 --> 01:04:45,965
You'll see when you have one.

1351
01:04:46,008 --> 01:04:47,053
No, actually, I won't see.

1352
01:04:47,096 --> 01:04:48,794
I...

1353
01:04:48,972 --> 01:04:50,107
Well, I can't have any kids.

1354
01:04:56,018 --> 01:04:57,547
God, I'm sorry.

1355
01:04:59,283 --> 01:05:00,851
Yeah, me too.

1356
01:05:18,035 --> 01:05:20,173
So, um, are you scared of labor?

1357
01:05:20,217 --> 01:05:21,479
Are you kidding?

1358
01:05:21,522 --> 01:05:22,871
Of course!

1359
01:05:22,915 --> 01:05:25,208
I know it's a dumb question,
but... mmm...

1360
01:05:25,526 --> 01:05:26,832
Are you doing a video?

1361
01:05:26,875 --> 01:05:28,007
God, no!

1362
01:05:28,050 --> 01:05:29,008
Okay.

1363
01:05:29,051 --> 01:05:30,379
No.

1364
01:05:30,380 --> 01:05:32,011
Okay. Smart choice.

1365
01:05:32,054 --> 01:05:34,274
Never go on camera
without proper hair and makeup.

1366
01:05:34,318 --> 01:05:37,669
That's right. Especially for
that kind of close-up.

1367
01:05:37,888 --> 01:05:39,756
Nurse, she's dilating!
More mascara, stat!

1368
01:05:46,997 --> 01:05:48,999
Somebody's a frowny-face.

1369
01:05:55,339 --> 01:05:56,296
What?

1370
01:05:56,540 --> 01:05:59,376
You know what really,
really concerns me?

1371
01:06:02,512 --> 01:06:04,114
The responsibility.

1372
01:06:05,174 --> 01:06:06,828
You're a responsible person.

1373
01:06:06,872 --> 01:06:09,119
At work, everyone says that you're...

1374
01:06:09,152 --> 01:06:12,789
No, you have to put
someone else first all the time.

1375
01:06:12,923 --> 01:06:15,141
Ah, but there, you're
worrying about it already.

1376
01:06:15,184 --> 01:06:16,693
You'll make a great mother.

1377
01:06:18,295 --> 01:06:19,296
You think?

1378
01:06:19,580 --> 01:06:20,497
Yes.

1379
01:06:21,331 --> 01:06:22,191
Really?

1380
01:06:22,235 --> 01:06:23,454
Yes.

1381
01:06:23,497 --> 01:06:24,455
You ready to go?

1382
01:06:24,498 --> 01:06:25,669
Yes.

1383
01:06:26,935 --> 01:06:28,372
It's a lovely place.

1384
01:06:28,415 --> 01:06:30,548
Thinking of starting a tab.

1385
01:06:30,591 --> 01:06:32,245
Such decor.

1386
01:06:32,642 --> 01:06:34,444
Early bowling alley.

1387
01:06:36,293 --> 01:06:39,416
Didn't your mother teach you
it's not polite to stare?

1388
01:06:39,948 --> 01:06:42,819
I can't go anywhere without being ogled.
It's exhausting!

1389
01:06:47,956 --> 01:06:49,915
Well, here's a weird question.

1390
01:06:50,093 --> 01:06:51,795
Ooh, those are the best kind.

1391
01:06:54,441 --> 01:06:56,400
Is there...

1392
01:06:56,443 --> 01:07:02,015
Is there something that your parents
could have done to make your life easier?

1393
01:07:02,144 --> 01:07:03,407
Yeah. Little things,

1394
01:07:03,450 --> 01:07:06,672
like they shouldn't have thrown
me out of the house when I was 15.

1395
01:07:06,801 --> 01:07:08,412
Right, but I mean, you know,

1396
01:07:08,455 --> 01:07:10,881
say... say your parents

1397
01:07:10,947 --> 01:07:15,419
wanted to really make you feel like you
were part of the family. Like, you know,

1398
01:07:15,462 --> 01:07:17,421
they really... they really
wanted to make you feel...

1399
01:07:17,464 --> 01:07:18,288
More accepted?

1400
01:07:18,321 --> 01:07:20,424
Yeah. Yeah, right.

1401
01:07:24,194 --> 01:07:25,429
I just...

1402
01:07:26,863 --> 01:07:29,733
I just wanted them to treat me the
same way they treated my brothers.

1403
01:07:29,833 --> 01:07:32,044
That should be simple enough.

1404
01:07:32,087 --> 01:07:33,045
- Go figure.
- Hey.

1405
01:07:33,937 --> 01:07:35,787
What'd you say to me in there?

1406
01:07:35,830 --> 01:07:37,832
It was a joke, all right?
Just forget it.

1407
01:07:37,876 --> 01:07:40,577
No, no. I want to know
what you said to me, faggot.

1408
01:07:40,677 --> 01:07:41,445
I want to know.

1409
01:07:41,478 --> 01:07:42,315
Just forget it.

1410
01:07:42,446 --> 01:07:43,316
Hey, hold it.

1411
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:44,317
I'm talking to you.

1412
01:07:44,361 --> 01:07:46,319
Yeah, well, he's not talking to you.

1413
01:07:46,363 --> 01:07:47,320
This is stupid.

1414
01:07:48,365 --> 01:07:49,322
Hey, let go of me!

1415
01:07:49,366 --> 01:07:52,978
Suzanne, run! Come on!

1416
01:07:53,021 --> 01:07:55,154
Look, damn it! Come on!

1417
01:07:55,197 --> 01:07:56,764
Stop it!

1418
01:07:56,893 --> 01:07:59,062
What the hell's wrong with you?

1419
01:08:00,681 --> 01:08:01,639
Oh, my god!

1420
01:08:01,682 --> 01:08:02,640
I'm so sorry!

1421
01:08:02,799 --> 01:08:04,201
I shouldn't have said anything.

1422
01:08:04,501 --> 01:08:05,643
No, it's my fault.

1423
01:08:05,686 --> 01:08:06,992
I should have just let it go.

1424
01:08:07,035 --> 01:08:07,993
Oh, god.

1425
01:08:08,036 --> 01:08:09,647
I think there's something wrong.

1426
01:08:10,273 --> 01:08:11,344
Oh, god!

1427
01:08:11,388 --> 01:08:13,433
I think there's something wrong!

1428
01:08:13,677 --> 01:08:14,911
Oh, god!

1429
01:08:19,221 --> 01:08:20,832
Rob, how is she?!

1430
01:08:21,651 --> 01:08:22,953
What's happened?

1431
01:08:23,053 --> 01:08:25,021
I haven't seen her yet.
They told us to wait.

1432
01:08:25,022 --> 01:08:27,360
- Where? Wait out here?
- The baby. What about the baby?

1433
01:08:27,404 --> 01:08:29,362
I don't know. They said
Suzanne was bleeding.

1434
01:08:29,406 --> 01:08:30,363
Where were you?

1435
01:08:30,407 --> 01:08:31,364
Where were you?

1436
01:08:31,408 --> 01:08:32,365
I was at home.

1437
01:08:32,409 --> 01:08:34,672
She went out with Brandon,
this guy from work, after.

1438
01:08:34,715 --> 01:08:35,673
Brandon?!

1439
01:08:35,716 --> 01:08:37,805
She is a pregnant woman, goddamn it!

1440
01:08:37,849 --> 01:08:40,460
If you can't take care of your
own wife, what are you doing here?

1441
01:08:40,504 --> 01:08:43,421
Walter, don't talk to me that way.
I'm not one of your children.

1442
01:08:43,550 --> 01:08:45,051
Did you hear how he speaks to me?

1443
01:08:45,152 --> 01:08:47,611
I've got a sick daughter,
and he's starting up like this?

1444
01:08:47,728 --> 01:08:48,816
What am I doing here?

1445
01:08:48,860 --> 01:08:50,580
There's never any room
for me, Walter.

1446
01:08:50,614 --> 01:08:52,820
You spoil your children.
You've smothered Suzanne.

1447
01:08:52,864 --> 01:08:54,866
Maybe you're right...
maybe I don't belong here at all.

1448
01:08:54,909 --> 01:08:55,867
What are you saying?

1449
01:08:55,910 --> 01:08:56,868
Of course you belong here.

1450
01:08:56,911 --> 01:08:57,869
Your wife needs you.

1451
01:08:57,912 --> 01:08:58,870
No, she needs you.

1452
01:08:58,913 --> 01:09:00,045
That's the problem, Phyllis.

1453
01:09:00,088 --> 01:09:01,046
Don't talk like this!

1454
01:09:01,089 --> 01:09:03,396
If he wants to leave, let him go!

1455
01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:04,528
We'll take care of ourselves!

1456
01:09:04,571 --> 01:09:06,660
You always do, don't you?

1457
01:09:06,704 --> 01:09:10,011
Rob, you're not going anywhere,
and Walter, you leave him alone.

1458
01:09:10,055 --> 01:09:12,369
I'm dying from all this!

1459
01:09:16,278 --> 01:09:17,441
Okay.

1460
01:09:17,758 --> 01:09:18,716
Where... where's David?

1461
01:09:18,759 --> 01:09:20,644
Rob, did you call David?

1462
01:09:23,246 --> 01:09:24,373
Walter, call him.

1463
01:09:24,417 --> 01:09:25,810
You got a quarter?

1464
01:09:25,853 --> 01:09:27,584
I got my credit card.

1465
01:09:27,751 --> 01:09:29,386
You never should have told David.

1466
01:09:31,598 --> 01:09:33,957
I... had to. He's my son.

1467
01:09:34,057 --> 01:09:35,646
We would have been fine,

1468
01:09:35,689 --> 01:09:37,648
but you all had to say something.

1469
01:09:37,691 --> 01:09:38,736
You just can't stop calling.

1470
01:09:38,779 --> 01:09:41,740
You just can't stop screwing up
your children's lives, can you?

1471
01:09:41,869 --> 01:09:43,915
You couldn't stop
pushing us apart, could you?

1472
01:09:44,201 --> 01:09:45,438
Everything would have been fine.

1473
01:09:45,482 --> 01:09:48,180
We would have taken care of this
on our own, our way. Our way.

1474
01:09:48,223 --> 01:09:50,530
That's what I was afraid of.

1475
01:09:50,774 --> 01:09:53,491
Phyllis, will you please leave me
alone for one lousy minute, all right?

1476
01:09:53,620 --> 01:09:55,579
Leave you alone... for one minute?

1477
01:09:55,622 --> 01:09:57,755
Yes, I... I'll leave you.

1478
01:09:57,798 --> 01:09:59,104
Phyllis...

1479
01:09:59,147 --> 01:09:59,983
What?

1480
01:10:00,050 --> 01:10:02,953
David's phone is disconnected.
Is disconnected.

1481
01:10:03,053 --> 01:10:04,321
Disconnected?

1482
01:10:04,388 --> 01:10:06,656
I need to see Suzanne's husband.

1483
01:10:11,986 --> 01:10:14,064
Your wife can see you now.

1484
01:10:23,006 --> 01:10:25,242
Aw, jeez, Suzanne.

1485
01:10:25,522 --> 01:10:26,784
Hey.

1486
01:10:26,827 --> 01:10:28,307
What happened?

1487
01:10:30,831 --> 01:10:33,083
Are my parents out there?

1488
01:10:35,919 --> 01:10:37,521
Yeah.

1489
01:10:40,490 --> 01:10:42,392
Yeah, they're...

1490
01:10:48,699 --> 01:10:49,763
I'll go get 'em.

1491
01:10:49,933 --> 01:10:51,535
No, wait, wait.

1492
01:10:51,568 --> 01:10:53,437
I want to talk to you alone.

1493
01:10:56,030 --> 01:10:58,141
I'm gonna be okay,

1494
01:10:59,409 --> 01:11:02,179
but I could lose the baby.

1495
01:11:04,915 --> 01:11:06,283
I know.

1496
01:11:14,701 --> 01:11:17,127
I don't want to lose it, Rob.

1497
01:11:23,200 --> 01:11:24,668
I know.

1498
01:11:35,879 --> 01:11:37,681
More...

1499
01:11:37,724 --> 01:11:41,206
than anything...

1500
01:11:41,249 --> 01:11:42,816
I want you...

1501
01:11:42,860 --> 01:11:45,622
to want this baby.

1502
01:11:49,736 --> 01:11:52,262
But if you can't...

1503
01:11:54,393 --> 01:11:59,803
I am not selling myself short anymore.

1504
01:12:02,923 --> 01:12:05,926
I am going to do this.

1505
01:12:42,846 --> 01:12:47,651
How many times do you have
to have your heart broken?

1506
01:12:48,316 --> 01:12:51,276
Sweetheart, I'm not a dramatic person.

1507
01:12:51,319 --> 01:12:54,279
I cut my losses, and I move on.

1508
01:12:54,322 --> 01:12:56,259
Now, thank god, she's okay.

1509
01:12:56,326 --> 01:12:57,627
That'swhat's important.

1510
01:12:57,661 --> 01:12:58,631
Oh, god...

1511
01:12:58,675 --> 01:13:01,155
And, as far as the other
thing goes, it's not

1512
01:13:01,199 --> 01:13:03,157
the end of the world.

1513
01:13:03,201 --> 01:13:04,681
If it was meant to be,

1514
01:13:04,724 --> 01:13:06,036
it was meant to be.

1515
01:13:07,304 --> 01:13:09,381
We're not completely
out of the woods yet.

1516
01:13:09,424 --> 01:13:10,273
We're not?

1517
01:13:10,307 --> 01:13:13,176
Is this your soothing
bedside manner, Dr. Sachs?

1518
01:13:13,210 --> 01:13:15,779
There are no guarantees, even now.

1519
01:13:27,138 --> 01:13:29,096
Albert, I don't know what to tell you.

1520
01:13:29,140 --> 01:13:31,962
Just make it work.
This isn't the ring...

1521
01:13:32,029 --> 01:13:34,058
If I don't have a ring,
I don't have an opera.

1522
01:13:34,197 --> 01:13:36,266
Just keep trying.

1523
01:13:36,867 --> 01:13:39,977
David Gold, it's past your bedtime!

1524
01:13:40,020 --> 01:13:41,979
Oh, god, I'm sorry!

1525
01:13:42,022 --> 01:13:42,980
Where have you been?

1526
01:13:43,023 --> 01:13:44,982
I was supposed to pick up Kevin.

1527
01:13:45,025 --> 01:13:46,984
You were? I'm sorry.
We're working late.

1528
01:13:47,027 --> 01:13:48,463
This is, uh...

1529
01:13:48,507 --> 01:13:49,464
This is the ring,

1530
01:13:49,508 --> 01:13:52,772
and you're just in time
to... see it do nothing.

1531
01:13:52,816 --> 01:13:53,773
What are you doing?

1532
01:13:53,817 --> 01:13:56,167
It's supposed to smoke
and make flames and... just...

1533
01:13:56,210 --> 01:13:57,168
It's working.

1534
01:14:00,040 --> 01:14:00,998
That's great!

1535
01:14:02,042 --> 01:14:04,027
Good job! That's wild!

1536
01:14:10,572 --> 01:14:12,069
Giving up?

1537
01:14:16,873 --> 01:14:18,942
I don't look at it that way.

1538
01:14:19,233 --> 01:14:21,144
I just, uh...

1539
01:14:21,888 --> 01:14:24,047
I don't believe in this anymore.

1540
01:14:24,369 --> 01:14:28,981
Oh, come down off the cross, Rob. You were
right there at my side the whole time.

1541
01:14:29,113 --> 01:14:31,115
Adrian, I think there's
a difference between

1542
01:14:31,158 --> 01:14:34,458
what we can do and what we should do.

1543
01:14:34,524 --> 01:14:36,760
But you've devoted your whole
career to being a scientist,

1544
01:14:36,793 --> 01:14:38,557
to objectivity.

1545
01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:41,498
Now you're making an emotional
value judgment and running scared.

1546
01:14:41,531 --> 01:14:43,233
I can't discuss this with you.

1547
01:14:45,433 --> 01:14:47,270
Rob, listen.

1548
01:14:48,939 --> 01:14:52,209
Every time we're on the verge
of making a positive change,

1549
01:14:52,275 --> 01:14:54,486
we run into fear and prejudice,

1550
01:14:54,529 --> 01:14:57,414
and then we end up taking
two steps back.

1551
01:14:58,446 --> 01:14:59,950
I'm disappointed.

1552
01:15:00,817 --> 01:15:01,580
You let me down.

1553
01:15:01,623 --> 01:15:03,387
Don't do that, Adrian.

1554
01:15:04,554 --> 01:15:08,058
I have enough disappointed
father figures in my life.

1555
01:15:09,283 --> 01:15:11,595
I need to do something else now.

1556
01:15:14,636 --> 01:15:16,166
I'm sorry.

1557
01:15:24,374 --> 01:15:25,675
Don't strain yourself.

1558
01:15:25,876 --> 01:15:26,909
Strain myself?

1559
01:15:26,910 --> 01:15:27,677
Just let me do that.

1560
01:15:27,678 --> 01:15:31,392
You heard what as long as I'm
not rock-climbing, I'm fine.

1561
01:15:31,523 --> 01:15:33,481
Even my parents get the message.

1562
01:15:34,700 --> 01:15:36,086
Rob, I'm okay.

1563
01:15:36,153 --> 01:15:37,137
I'm... I'm okay.

1564
01:15:37,181 --> 01:15:38,356
Rob... Robert, Robert, Robert.

1565
01:15:38,399 --> 01:15:40,358
I'm cleaning up.

1566
01:15:40,401 --> 01:15:41,881
I'm cleaning up, that's all.

1567
01:15:41,925 --> 01:15:43,448
It's okay, okay?

1568
01:15:43,491 --> 01:15:46,530
Just leave... leave this all here.

1569
01:15:47,321 --> 01:15:49,628
Just sit down, Robert.

1570
01:15:49,671 --> 01:15:51,586
Listen to me.

1571
01:15:51,802 --> 01:15:53,588
I really appreciate

1572
01:15:53,737 --> 01:15:56,173
what you've been doing for me.

1573
01:15:56,606 --> 01:15:58,108
I do.

1574
01:15:59,333 --> 01:16:03,180
But I can take care
of myself now, okay?

1575
01:16:05,015 --> 01:16:06,883
And right now...

1576
01:16:08,690 --> 01:16:13,523
what I need more than anything
else is just to be alone.

1577
01:16:14,324 --> 01:16:15,959
You know?

1578
01:16:18,962 --> 01:16:20,597
It's time.

1579
01:16:29,189 --> 01:16:30,140
Okay?

1580
01:16:31,641 --> 01:16:33,009
Okay.

1581
01:16:37,514 --> 01:16:39,116
Okay.

1582
01:16:49,209 --> 01:16:50,894
I've got, uh...

1583
01:16:51,211 --> 01:16:52,865
I've got most of my stuff out,

1584
01:16:52,909 --> 01:16:54,431
and, uh...

1585
01:16:58,001 --> 01:16:59,435
You know where I am,

1586
01:16:59,436 --> 01:17:01,004
so...

1587
01:17:01,569 --> 01:17:03,006
if I forgot anything...

1588
01:17:03,049 --> 01:17:04,529
Rob.

1589
01:17:04,572 --> 01:17:05,530
If you need anything.

1590
01:17:05,573 --> 01:17:06,777
Rob...

1591
01:18:35,032 --> 01:18:37,701
Oh, god, what a gorgeous day.

1592
01:18:38,144 --> 01:18:40,404
I can't believe I have to rehearse.

1593
01:18:44,041 --> 01:18:46,043
So, why won't you tell me
where you're going?

1594
01:18:46,143 --> 01:18:47,744
Meeting somebody.

1595
01:18:48,645 --> 01:18:49,634
Who?

1596
01:18:49,677 --> 01:18:52,289
You don't have to know everything.

1597
01:18:52,332 --> 01:18:53,290
Somebody cute?

1598
01:18:53,333 --> 01:18:54,987
Oh, god!

1599
01:18:55,031 --> 01:18:55,988
What?

1600
01:18:56,032 --> 01:18:57,990
What are you getting
all pissy with me for?

1601
01:18:58,034 --> 01:18:58,991
I'm very vulnerable.

1602
01:18:59,035 --> 01:19:00,993
All right, David, look,

1603
01:19:01,037 --> 01:19:02,458
you can make any excuses you want.

1604
01:19:02,459 --> 01:19:04,997
You know you can't move on
with so much unresolved.

1605
01:19:05,041 --> 01:19:06,477
Please, will you stop it.

1606
01:19:06,520 --> 01:19:08,479
I don't want to talk about them.

1607
01:19:08,699 --> 01:19:10,481
No, you're gonna have
to talk about 'em, David.

1608
01:19:10,524 --> 01:19:14,137
I mean, come on, this is ridiculous.
Nobody can live without a past.

1609
01:19:14,180 --> 01:19:16,008
You lose all definition.

1610
01:19:16,052 --> 01:19:18,175
You lose yourself.

1611
01:19:18,208 --> 01:19:19,316
No, I don't.

1612
01:19:19,359 --> 01:19:20,317
They lost me.

1613
01:19:20,360 --> 01:19:22,845
David, I know this is gonna sound
a little dopey to you, okay,

1614
01:19:22,846 --> 01:19:25,982
but no matter how far away you go,
they're still your family, okay?

1615
01:19:26,049 --> 01:19:27,017
You're connected to 'em.

1616
01:19:27,050 --> 01:19:29,386
There's always gonna be that
little twitch upon the thread.

1617
01:19:29,453 --> 01:19:31,288
You're gonna have to deal with it.

1618
01:19:31,755 --> 01:19:33,623
I don't have to do anything.

1619
01:19:35,859 --> 01:19:37,794
Well, that's real mature.

1620
01:19:38,795 --> 01:19:40,896
Okay, well, look, you're gonna
have to deal with me, then.

1621
01:19:40,897 --> 01:19:44,297
And, you know, I don't know
what's going on with you,

1622
01:19:44,341 --> 01:19:47,871
but I don't know how I feel about living
with only what's left of you. I mean, I...

1623
01:19:48,910 --> 01:19:50,974
I miss the rest.

1624
01:19:54,311 --> 01:19:55,879
You got it, you got it, you got it!

1625
01:20:00,313 --> 01:20:01,485
Leave it.

1626
01:20:02,010 --> 01:20:05,188
Yes! Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

1627
01:20:05,789 --> 01:20:06,957
Good game, man!

1628
01:20:07,024 --> 01:20:08,713
Howard, very nice!

1629
01:20:08,756 --> 01:20:10,594
Off his tuches!

1630
01:20:11,846 --> 01:20:13,065
Oh, that's fine.

1631
01:20:13,109 --> 01:20:13,964
More than fine.

1632
01:20:13,997 --> 01:20:17,069
When you whip the Kleins bad,
it's more than fine!

1633
01:20:17,200 --> 01:20:18,070
Oh, man.

1634
01:20:18,114 --> 01:20:21,378
Say, you're...
you're, uh, quite an athlete.

1635
01:20:21,571 --> 01:20:22,806
Thanks.

1636
01:20:23,440 --> 01:20:27,558
I try to get David, you know, to be
interested in tennis, take it seriously,

1637
01:20:27,601 --> 01:20:31,548
but he was always interested
in music and all that.

1638
01:20:32,082 --> 01:20:34,217
Oh, I know. It drives me crazy.

1639
01:20:34,260 --> 01:20:36,741
Yeah? You're not an opera aficionado?

1640
01:20:36,784 --> 01:20:38,055
No, no. I hate it.

1641
01:20:38,588 --> 01:20:39,890
Yeah?

1642
01:20:43,704 --> 01:20:44,961
Thank you.

1643
01:20:46,359 --> 01:20:48,274
My favorite opera is Tosca...

1644
01:20:48,318 --> 01:20:49,933
they all die!

1645
01:20:53,279 --> 01:20:55,238
So, uh...

1646
01:20:55,372 --> 01:20:57,107
Can I buy you lunch?

1647
01:21:00,410 --> 01:21:01,845
Lunch?

1648
01:21:02,946 --> 01:21:04,381
Together?

1649
01:21:07,351 --> 01:21:08,903
Uh... well, you know...

1650
01:21:09,586 --> 01:21:12,124
Uh, how 'bout if, um,
you come over to the house,

1651
01:21:12,168 --> 01:21:14,358
and maybe Phyllis will make us
some lunch or something.

1652
01:21:14,424 --> 01:21:16,607
Okay. Great, yeah.

1653
01:21:16,650 --> 01:21:18,428
Okay. Have you ever been to our house?

1654
01:21:18,495 --> 01:21:19,610
No, no, I haven't.

1655
01:21:19,653 --> 01:21:20,611
No, I didn't...

1656
01:21:20,654 --> 01:21:21,960
I didn't think so.

1657
01:21:22,003 --> 01:21:24,000
We've never been to your house.

1658
01:21:25,068 --> 01:21:27,139
You know, you play very good tennis...!

1659
01:21:38,248 --> 01:21:41,109
So, as our journey comes to an end, um,

1660
01:21:41,153 --> 01:21:42,633
and a beginning again...

1661
01:21:42,676 --> 01:21:45,201
hence this cycle, this ring cycle...

1662
01:21:46,680 --> 01:21:49,259
...let's remember that
we all bear a responsibility

1663
01:21:49,292 --> 01:21:53,697
for what's going to happen tonight
and on consequent nights, and, um,

1664
01:21:53,797 --> 01:21:56,066
we can all be blamed,
and we all will be.

1665
01:21:57,067 --> 01:21:58,605
So, uh, break legs,

1666
01:21:59,069 --> 01:22:02,000
and, uh, in our world,
in the opera world,

1667
01:22:02,043 --> 01:22:03,175
in bocca al Lupo!

1668
01:22:03,219 --> 01:22:05,308
In bocca al Lupo!

1669
01:22:05,351 --> 01:22:06,309
Let's make art!

1670
01:22:09,355 --> 01:22:11,481
There's some people I want you to meet.

1671
01:22:11,515 --> 01:22:12,315
Critics?

1672
01:22:12,358 --> 01:22:13,383
Uh... used to be. Come on.

1673
01:22:13,684 --> 01:22:14,665
Come on.

1674
01:22:14,708 --> 01:22:15,666
This is important.

1675
01:22:15,709 --> 01:22:16,754
Where are you taking me?

1676
01:22:16,797 --> 01:22:17,755
Ah, you'll see.

1677
01:22:17,798 --> 01:22:20,290
- Why are we panicking upstairs?
- Follow me.

1678
01:22:23,891 --> 01:22:25,850
I had a feeling you'd
try something like this.

1679
01:22:25,893 --> 01:22:28,932
Well, you didn't
tell me not to, specifically.

1680
01:22:31,159 --> 01:22:32,509
Oh, my god, look at you.

1681
01:22:32,636 --> 01:22:34,271
You're huge!

1682
01:22:35,472 --> 01:22:36,707
Yep.

1683
01:22:40,410 --> 01:22:42,379
What are you doing here?

1684
01:22:43,013 --> 01:22:45,348
Well, you know how we love Wagner.

1685
01:22:48,568 --> 01:22:50,657
Well, where's Rob?

1686
01:22:50,701 --> 01:22:52,522
Rob is not here.

1687
01:22:55,923 --> 01:22:57,260
I'm sorry.

1688
01:23:01,277 --> 01:23:02,998
So, uh, why did you come here, anyway?

1689
01:23:02,999 --> 01:23:04,367
Do you want my sympathy, or...?

1690
01:23:04,468 --> 01:23:05,672
David...

1691
01:23:05,769 --> 01:23:07,471
David, come on.

1692
01:23:08,980 --> 01:23:10,307
I knew we shouldn't have come.

1693
01:23:10,374 --> 01:23:12,375
No. Suzanne, please.

1694
01:23:12,576 --> 01:23:14,845
Stop it, both of you.

1695
01:23:14,942 --> 01:23:16,553
David...

1696
01:23:16,713 --> 01:23:19,583
Don't be so quick to judge us.

1697
01:23:20,917 --> 01:23:23,086
You know, we did do something right...

1698
01:23:23,687 --> 01:23:27,624
We raised two perfect children.

1699
01:23:28,759 --> 01:23:31,394
Well, mother, this is not
the time or the place,

1700
01:23:31,437 --> 01:23:34,231
and it's kind of late for that
conversation right now, isn't it?

1701
01:23:34,297 --> 01:23:35,766
No, don't say that.

1702
01:23:35,832 --> 01:23:39,603
It's never too late
for your own family, David.

1703
01:23:40,637 --> 01:23:43,206
Are we really that terrible?

1704
01:23:43,974 --> 01:23:47,932
I was telling Steven
at the club, we do come around.

1705
01:23:48,045 --> 01:23:49,194
The club?

1706
01:23:49,546 --> 01:23:51,181
Yeah. We play tennis.

1707
01:23:51,936 --> 01:23:53,250
You what?

1708
01:23:54,751 --> 01:23:57,454
We beat the shit out of the Kleins!

1709
01:23:58,508 --> 01:23:59,656
Well, he did.

1710
01:23:59,890 --> 01:24:02,125
And then, uh, we went over to
the house for a little lunch.

1711
01:24:04,027 --> 01:24:06,530
He doesn't eat much, this one,

1712
01:24:06,697 --> 01:24:08,498
but I'm working on him!

1713
01:24:09,366 --> 01:24:10,934
I don't believe it.

1714
01:24:11,101 --> 01:24:13,603
Just don't expect me
to march in a parade.

1715
01:24:16,139 --> 01:24:18,005
Come on, we've got
to get to our seats, okay?

1716
01:24:18,049 --> 01:24:19,042
It's curtain time.

1717
01:24:19,142 --> 01:24:21,313
So... we'll talk?

1718
01:24:21,357 --> 01:24:22,546
We'll talk.

1719
01:24:22,662 --> 01:24:24,247
We'll talk.

1720
01:24:24,360 --> 01:24:25,882
Break a leg.

1721
01:24:28,919 --> 01:24:31,088
This isn't gonna be easy, you know?

1722
01:24:31,621 --> 01:24:33,023
I know.

1723
01:24:34,291 --> 01:24:36,927
But that's the way it is, so...

1724
01:24:40,130 --> 01:24:41,898
I don't need any help.

1725
01:24:43,367 --> 01:24:44,868
Did I offer?

1726
01:24:48,872 --> 01:24:49,973
Fine.

1727
01:24:50,340 --> 01:24:51,541
Fine.

1728
01:24:52,142 --> 01:24:53,143
Great.

1729
01:24:53,677 --> 01:24:54,678
Excellent.

1730
01:24:54,911 --> 01:24:55,612
Fabulous.

1731
01:24:55,746 --> 01:24:57,247
Fabulous.

1732
01:24:58,382 --> 01:24:59,950
Lovely.

1733
01:25:03,653 --> 01:25:05,422
Oh, beautiful.

1734
01:25:28,712 --> 01:25:30,781
So the story goes
that Siegfried can only find

1735
01:25:30,847 --> 01:25:33,817
love by walking through
the magic fire. So...

1736
01:25:34,017 --> 01:25:35,652
What is the magic fire?

1737
01:25:36,153 --> 01:25:40,044
It's the fire of hell that will burn
you if you question what you're told.

1738
01:25:40,087 --> 01:25:44,615
It's everything you're afraid of
because you're supposed to be.

1739
01:25:44,744 --> 01:25:46,904
But then how come Siegfried
walks right through it

1740
01:25:47,005 --> 01:25:48,565
without so much as singeing an eyebrow?

1741
01:25:48,632 --> 01:25:51,708
It's because the magic fire is a fraud.

1742
01:25:51,751 --> 01:25:53,231
It can't hurt you.

1743
01:25:53,274 --> 01:25:55,605
Mankind will keep creating
new and better worlds,

1744
01:25:55,706 --> 01:25:57,975
and there will always be those
who are left, for whatever

1745
01:25:58,018 --> 01:25:59,977
reason, on the other side
of the magic fire.

1746
01:26:00,020 --> 01:26:02,813
But those who are brave enough
to walk through that fire

1747
01:26:02,879 --> 01:26:05,515
will awaken another part of their soul,

1748
01:26:05,615 --> 01:26:08,420
and they will know
what it means to truly love,

1749
01:26:08,552 --> 01:26:10,287
without question.

1750
01:26:25,959 --> 01:26:28,919
So, I guess that's
the end of this story.

1751
01:26:28,962 --> 01:26:30,268
Dad was right...

1752
01:26:30,311 --> 01:26:34,272
sometimes people do
come around, even me.

1753
01:26:34,315 --> 01:26:36,579
He and mom are back
to calling three times a week,

1754
01:26:36,622 --> 01:26:39,451
mostly to talk to Steven.

1755
01:26:39,495 --> 01:26:43,193
As for Rob, he shows up on the
weekends to take care of his son.

1756
01:26:43,324 --> 01:26:46,823
He's good with him, so, you never know.

1757
01:26:48,982 --> 01:26:50,594
And Suzanne?

1758
01:26:51,637 --> 01:26:52,943
Well...

1759
01:26:52,986 --> 01:26:55,365
