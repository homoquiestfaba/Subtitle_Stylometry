1
00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:17,118
01 Beyond The Sky English.

2
00:00:20,219 --> 00:00:21,899
[GIRL ALLIE] My mother
always talked to me

3
00:00:22,139 --> 00:00:24,049
a lot about the sky.

4
00:00:24,258 --> 00:00:26,214
She liked to watch
the clouds in the day

5
00:00:26,419 --> 00:00:30,810
and the stars at night...
especially the stars.

6
00:00:31,219 --> 00:00:33,653
We would play a game sometimes.

7
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:37,090
A game called
What's Beyond the Sky?

8
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:40,655
We would imagine darkness
or a blinding light

9
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:43,653
or something else that
we didn't know how to name.

10
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:47,649
But. Of course.
That was just a game.

11
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:50,055
There's nothing beyond the sky.

12
00:00:50,261 --> 00:00:53,411
The sky just is. And it goes on and on.

13
00:00:53,621 --> 00:00:55,930
And we play all of our games
beneath it.

14
00:00:59,901 --> 00:01:01,892
Coming in. Twelve o'clock high!

15
00:01:02,102 --> 00:01:04,741
Tail gunner. Get the bogey!

16
00:01:05,142 --> 00:01:06,655
Gunners...

17
00:01:06,902 --> 00:01:09,096
give 'em short bursts
when they're in range.

18
00:01:09,303 --> 00:01:10,655
Do not waste ammunition.

19
00:01:14,342 --> 00:01:15,775
Watch out!

20
00:01:17,623 --> 00:01:20,091
Bandit, twelve o'clock.

21
00:01:20,503 --> 00:01:22,971
Watch out,
they'll come back around.

22
00:01:23,383 --> 00:01:25,374
There's one! There's one!

23
00:01:27,223 --> 00:01:29,783
- That was too close!
- Roger that!

24
00:01:31,664 --> 00:01:32,937
Nine o'clock!

25
00:01:35,385 --> 00:01:36,864
He's coming around. I'm on him!

26
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:39,858
Come on. You lousy Kraut!
Come to papa! Yeah!

27
00:01:40,264 --> 00:01:41,413
Whoo! I got him!

28
00:01:41,625 --> 00:01:44,185
Nine o'clock.
Keep your eyes open!

29
00:01:46,906 --> 00:01:48,133
There's another one!

30
00:01:48,345 --> 00:01:49,743
Whoo-hoo!

31
00:01:52,026 --> 00:01:53,378
Captain!

32
00:01:53,585 --> 00:01:54,654
What do you got, Toland?

33
00:01:54,866 --> 00:01:57,174
Lights... blue ones.

34
00:01:57,386 --> 00:01:58,660
- We see them. Too!
- Holy Mary!

35
00:01:59,066 --> 00:02:01,122
- What the hell are they?
- Let's get a look at these.

36
00:02:01,146 --> 00:02:03,785
- Are they Germans?
- They're too bright. I can't see!

37
00:02:04,187 --> 00:02:05,665
Three bogeys. Moving fast!

38
00:02:06,027 --> 00:02:08,665
Everybody keep calm.
We're gonna take care of this.

39
00:02:09,067 --> 00:02:11,348
- Bandit. Twelve o'clock!
- F-1s coming down on our left.

40
00:02:11,387 --> 00:02:13,503
Head right. Full throttle!

41
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:18,940
- I'm hit!
- Oh, Christ! Russ!

42
00:02:24,148 --> 00:02:26,537
- We're losing altitude!
- We're losing engines!

43
00:02:26,748 --> 00:02:28,100
Co-pilot. Take the plane!

44
00:02:28,308 --> 00:02:30,219
- Co-pilot, take the plane!
- Yes, sir!

45
00:02:30,429 --> 00:02:31,656
Captain Keys is on fire!

46
00:02:31,989 --> 00:02:34,059
Cover his tail!

47
00:02:34,269 --> 00:02:36,907
You hang on. Russ!
We're getting out of here!

48
00:02:37,309 --> 00:02:39,869
- We lost an engine!
- Shut it down!

49
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:43,664
They're coming back!

50
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:46,337
Christ. All around us!
Keys is going down!

51
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:49,666
She's breaking up!

52
00:02:50,871 --> 00:02:54,386
We're going down!
Get a parachute!

53
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:55,740
We gotta get out of here!

54
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:58,061
Let's go. Guys!

55
00:02:58,271 --> 00:03:00,579
We've gotta bail out now!

56
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:02,701
Captain, we've got to bail out!

57
00:03:02,912 --> 00:03:04,469
I don't want to die!

58
00:03:04,671 --> 00:03:07,902
Trust me, Johnson... we won't die.

59
00:04:21,637 --> 00:04:23,593
[ALLIE] Russell Keys
came home from the war

60
00:04:23,798 --> 00:04:25,516
like a lot of other soldiers.

61
00:04:25,718 --> 00:04:27,116
He was tired of fighting.

62
00:04:27,318 --> 00:04:29,433
And he was very glad
to be coming home.

63
00:04:29,638 --> 00:04:31,318
There were things
that had happened to him.

64
00:04:31,758 --> 00:04:33,635
And he knew that
he was not the same person

65
00:04:33,838 --> 00:04:35,430
he had been when he left.

66
00:04:35,638 --> 00:04:36,912
He had changed.

67
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:39,513
And he wondered about
all the things here at home

68
00:04:39,719 --> 00:04:41,913
that might have changed. Too.
While he'd been away.

69
00:04:42,119 --> 00:04:44,394
But sometimes
when you go somewhere far away

70
00:04:44,599 --> 00:04:45,793
and then come back.

71
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:47,712
The part that bothers you most

72
00:04:48,119 --> 00:04:50,587
is not the things that have changed.

73
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:53,273
But the way that other things
have stayed the same.

74
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,948
Like you hadn't been anywhere
or done anything at all.

75
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,554
Hello, Mum.

76
00:04:59,601 --> 00:05:01,795
The kids would still play ball
on the vacant lot

77
00:05:02,201 --> 00:05:04,760
where he and his friends
had played every summer.

78
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,549
The high-school band would
still play every Friday night

79
00:05:07,761 --> 00:05:09,479
in the park downtown.

80
00:05:09,681 --> 00:05:11,672
And old Mrs Parker
would still be waiting.

81
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:13,633
As the kids
came home from school.

82
00:05:13,961 --> 00:05:17,033
To yell at them
if they stepped on her flowers.

83
00:05:17,241 --> 00:05:19,675
All of that might still be the same.

84
00:05:19,922 --> 00:05:21,274
But he was different.

85
00:05:21,482 --> 00:05:23,598
And so nothing would really
be the same at all.

86
00:05:23,802 --> 00:05:25,440
- I know you will.
- Miss?

87
00:05:25,643 --> 00:05:28,281
Who do I talk to about getting
one of those G. I. Loans?

88
00:05:47,404 --> 00:05:49,793
I remember the day
I proposed to your mother.

89
00:05:50,205 --> 00:05:52,513
I was nervous as hell.

90
00:05:52,725 --> 00:05:55,114
I can't picture anything
making you nervous.

91
00:05:55,325 --> 00:05:57,679
I had to walk
around the block five times,

92
00:05:57,965 --> 00:06:00,195
and then I walked
halfway home after that

93
00:06:00,405 --> 00:06:02,635
before I finally managed
to get my nerve up.

94
00:06:05,326 --> 00:06:08,716
Of course, I hadn't had
the life experience that you've had.

95
00:06:16,967 --> 00:06:19,434
- Dad.
- Hmm?

96
00:06:19,646 --> 00:06:22,319
My car looked real nice.

97
00:06:22,727 --> 00:06:26,356
Well, we hid her
from a couple of scrap drives.

98
00:06:26,567 --> 00:06:28,206
Kind of unpatriotic, I guess,

99
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:31,679
but we did our bit in other ways.

100
00:06:38,288 --> 00:06:39,880
Was it very terrible?

101
00:06:43,368 --> 00:06:44,960
Nah, it wasn't so bad.

102
00:06:50,329 --> 00:06:51,761
[RUSSELL]
What do you got. Toland?

103
00:06:52,169 --> 00:06:54,399
Lights! Blue ones!

104
00:06:54,609 --> 00:06:56,166
What the hell are they?!

105
00:06:56,689 --> 00:06:58,644
[MACHINE-GUN FIRE]

106
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:01,725
[JOHNSON]
Captain. We've got to bail out!

107
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:03,443
I don't want to die!

108
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:07,086
Trust me. Johnson... we won't die.

109
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:16,126
[ALLIE] They say some men

110
00:07:16,331 --> 00:07:18,686
carry their war with them
for the rest of their lives.

111
00:07:19,091 --> 00:07:23,209
And some men put it behind them
like an old pair of shoes.

112
00:07:23,412 --> 00:07:26,688
And then. I guess. There are
others who go on fighting.

113
00:07:26,892 --> 00:07:29,928
Even if they have no idea
who their fight is with

114
00:07:30,132 --> 00:07:33,203
or why it's so important
not to give up.

115
00:07:42,213 --> 00:07:44,328
[MAN] Some people
will tell you the war was won

116
00:07:44,534 --> 00:07:45,683
by superior manpower.

117
00:07:45,933 --> 00:07:48,002
Some people say that it was strategy

118
00:07:48,213 --> 00:07:49,805
or a just cause

119
00:07:50,214 --> 00:07:52,489
or the fact that
we're so damn tough.

120
00:07:52,694 --> 00:07:53,694
None of that is true.

121
00:07:54,054 --> 00:07:57,683
What won the war was secrets...

122
00:07:57,975 --> 00:08:00,967
knowing theirs and keeping ours.

123
00:08:01,175 --> 00:08:03,642
Gentlemen, meet the Enola Gay.

124
00:08:06,455 --> 00:08:08,810
When the Enola Gay dropped
her payload on Hiroshima,

125
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:11,683
only 107 men in the entire country

126
00:08:11,895 --> 00:08:13,931
knew what that specific payload was.

127
00:08:14,135 --> 00:08:16,649
The B-29 had been redesigned
to carry its load,

128
00:08:16,856 --> 00:08:20,815
and a new crew, selected
to carry an atomic bomb, was on board.

129
00:08:21,016 --> 00:08:23,405
They were carrying out
a mission so secret

130
00:08:23,616 --> 00:08:25,971
that even they didn't know
what it was.

131
00:08:26,377 --> 00:08:28,527
The secret was kept
until the ultimate moment.

132
00:08:28,857 --> 00:08:32,247
As a result, the war was won.

133
00:08:33,817 --> 00:08:35,853
As members of the Intelligence Corps,

134
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:38,412
it will be your job to keep secrets.

135
00:08:38,618 --> 00:08:40,130
Here at the 509th Bomb Group,

136
00:08:40,538 --> 00:08:42,607
that responsibility
is made all the more awesome

137
00:08:42,817 --> 00:08:44,808
by the fact that we are
the only base authorised

138
00:08:45,018 --> 00:08:46,371
to store atomic weapons.

139
00:08:46,578 --> 00:08:47,692
At any given moment,

140
00:08:47,898 --> 00:08:49,695
your ability to keep your mouth shut

141
00:08:49,978 --> 00:08:52,287
and, if necessary,
to lie through your teeth

142
00:08:52,499 --> 00:08:55,012
may very well determine
the course of history.

143
00:08:57,139 --> 00:08:59,208
Group, ten-hut!

144
00:08:59,419 --> 00:09:01,694
We had 18 more sightings today.

145
00:09:01,979 --> 00:09:03,970
Dancing lights, mostly.

146
00:09:04,179 --> 00:09:07,455
The bulk of them
over the Pacific Northwest

147
00:09:07,659 --> 00:09:10,014
and three, I think,
over the Great Lakes.

148
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:12,932
Something Russian?

149
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:15,376
I heard something on the radio.

150
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:18,856
People were saying that they're
from another planet.

151
00:09:19,261 --> 00:09:21,491
We used to hear that
a lot at Los Alamos.

152
00:09:21,701 --> 00:09:23,692
We never knew if it was
something of ours

153
00:09:23,901 --> 00:09:25,380
or something
the Germans had going.

154
00:09:25,581 --> 00:09:29,129
That's right, Owen, I forgot.
You were at Los Alamos.

155
00:09:32,221 --> 00:09:34,416
We got a new mare in at the stables.

156
00:09:34,622 --> 00:09:36,897
I thought you might like
to join me for a ride.

157
00:09:37,302 --> 00:09:39,577
- I'd like that very much.
- Fine.

158
00:09:39,902 --> 00:09:41,699
Will you be joining us?

159
00:09:41,982 --> 00:09:43,381
No. She doesn't ride.

160
00:09:43,582 --> 00:09:45,254
Her constitution...

161
00:09:45,662 --> 00:09:47,698
it's a little too delicate.

162
00:09:50,303 --> 00:09:51,703
He's a bit of a bully, your father.

163
00:09:51,903 --> 00:09:54,895
It's not personal.
He just... he's like that.

164
00:09:55,103 --> 00:09:57,696
Captain, are you gonna ride
or stand around yapping?

165
00:09:57,903 --> 00:09:59,302
If he doesn't let you ride,

166
00:09:59,504 --> 00:10:01,698
how does he feel about you
going to the movies?

167
00:10:16,145 --> 00:10:17,498
Man named Kenneth Arnold...

168
00:10:17,705 --> 00:10:20,172
Private pilot out of Boise
flying over the Cascades...

169
00:10:20,586 --> 00:10:23,497
Says he saw nine
saucer-shaped disks in the sky.

170
00:10:24,706 --> 00:10:26,218
This is all over the Seattle papers.

171
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,826
Wire services picked it up,
and they're running with it.

172
00:10:28,986 --> 00:10:30,426
And they're running with it, sir.

173
00:10:30,626 --> 00:10:32,266
You don't want to forget
about the sir.

174
00:10:32,546 --> 00:10:33,898
Some officers around here

175
00:10:34,307 --> 00:10:36,945
that can really get their shorts
in a bunch over that, Howard.

176
00:10:37,347 --> 00:10:39,383

00:53:34,508 --> 00:53:35,860
at his bar mitzvah.

709
00:53:36,068 --> 00:53:37,819
He saw his father.

710
00:53:38,029 --> 00:53:40,098
Apparently, that's what killed him.

711
00:53:40,308 --> 00:53:42,378
And the... visitor.

712
00:53:44,549 --> 00:53:46,106
You've been a lot of help,

713
00:53:46,508 --> 00:53:48,028
and, doctor, I think
you can appreciate

714
00:53:48,429 --> 00:53:49,657
how important it could be

715
00:53:49,869 --> 00:53:51,938
that you say nothing about this
to anyone.

716
00:53:54,790 --> 00:53:56,905
They can appear
as people, you say?

717
00:53:57,150 --> 00:53:59,617
Yes, as unbelievable
as that seems.

718
00:53:59,829 --> 00:54:01,429
And exposure to one
of these apparitions,

719
00:54:01,790 --> 00:54:04,065
that's what killed Dr Goldin?

720
00:54:04,430 --> 00:54:07,580
It's not safe to spend
too much time with one of them.

721
00:54:07,790 --> 00:54:09,223
Whoa.

722
00:54:14,831 --> 00:54:16,822
How do you feel?

723
00:54:17,031 --> 00:54:20,148
Like I'm floating.

724
00:54:30,512 --> 00:54:31,910
Headaches?

725
00:54:32,272 --> 00:54:33,864
Anything like that?

726
00:54:34,073 --> 00:54:35,904
Nothing like that.

727
00:54:37,832 --> 00:54:40,346
That's good. That's good.

728
00:54:40,753 --> 00:54:41,902
[footsteps]

729
00:54:54,474 --> 00:54:55,668
Tom?

730
00:54:59,114 --> 00:55:00,433
Becky?

731
00:55:05,275 --> 00:55:08,904
Wimmy, wammy, woo!

732
00:55:14,516 --> 00:55:16,585
That was amazing.

733
00:55:23,116 --> 00:55:25,835
[BECKY] Mama,
John's been doing magic tricks

734
00:55:26,037 --> 00:55:28,266
that are much better than Tom's.

735
00:55:29,877 --> 00:55:30,911
You're not hungry?

736
00:55:31,317 --> 00:55:32,715
- No, I...
- He's never hungry.

737
00:55:32,917 --> 00:55:33,917
Tom, that's enough.

738
00:55:34,197 --> 00:55:35,311
No, it's all right.

739
00:55:36,557 --> 00:55:38,787
How are you feeling?
Your headache?

740
00:55:38,997 --> 00:55:41,511
I'm fine. I hadn't even
thought about it. Thank you.

741
00:55:41,718 --> 00:55:43,230
Good. That's good.

742
00:55:43,638 --> 00:55:45,238
[TOM] So where did you
come from, anyway?

743
00:55:45,598 --> 00:55:48,795
- Tom...
- I don't mind.

744
00:55:48,998 --> 00:55:49,998
I come from Des Moines.

745
00:55:50,199 --> 00:55:52,588
That's like 1,000 miles
away from here.

746
00:55:52,799 --> 00:55:53,913
How'd you know that?

747
00:55:54,118 --> 00:55:55,756
It's where
my magic kit came from.

748
00:55:55,959 --> 00:55:58,267
Tom, Becky, sit up
and watch your manners.

749
00:55:58,479 --> 00:56:00,549
I come from there originally.

750
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:03,991
I've just been working
any place I could since then.

751
00:56:04,399 --> 00:56:05,673
Farm work, mainly.

752
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:07,916
What happened to you
that got you so messed up?

753
00:56:08,279 --> 00:56:09,792
Machine accident.

754
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,831
Why are you being
so mean to John?

755
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:13,995
- He's our friend.
- He's not my friend.

756
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:16,839
You certainly seem
to be recovering nicely.

757
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:21,352
Like I told you,
I just needed a little rest.

758
00:56:21,561 --> 00:56:23,201
[SALLY] So now that
you're feeling better,

759
00:56:23,481 --> 00:56:24,879
I guess you'll be moving on?

760
00:56:25,081 --> 00:56:26,081
[JOHN] I guess so.

761
00:56:26,282 --> 00:56:27,953
I just need a few more days.

762
00:56:38,002 --> 00:56:41,074
Everyone knows
not to stare into the sun.

763
00:56:41,283 --> 00:56:43,921
It's something your mother
tells you when you're a kid.

764
00:56:44,242 --> 00:56:46,881
Don't look at the sun.
Or you'll go blind.

765
00:56:47,083 --> 00:56:49,802
But sometimes you want to
understand something so badly

766
00:56:50,003 --> 00:56:52,563
that you'll risk going blind
for just a glimpse

767
00:56:52,763 --> 00:56:54,719
of what it all might be about.

768
00:57:04,924 --> 00:57:05,924
Damn.

769
00:57:08,484 --> 00:57:10,394
I brought you something.

770
00:57:12,765 --> 00:57:13,914
Thanks, Captain.

771
00:57:14,325 --> 00:57:15,917
You got married, huh?

772
00:57:17,405 --> 00:57:18,917
Same girl?

773
00:57:19,245 --> 00:57:21,361
The one that worked at the bank?

774
00:57:22,686 --> 00:57:24,004
Yeah, same one.

775
00:57:33,967 --> 00:57:36,321
What the hell
are you doing here, Captain?

776
00:57:38,567 --> 00:57:40,797
Not that I'm not glad to see you.

777
00:57:43,207 --> 00:57:45,437
Do you know about the other men?

778
00:57:47,647 --> 00:57:49,000
What about them?

779
00:57:51,928 --> 00:57:53,077
They're dead.

780
00:57:56,088 --> 00:57:57,123
Same thing?

781
00:57:58,369 --> 00:57:59,926
Yeah, more or less.

782
00:58:03,169 --> 00:58:04,283
What about you?

783
00:58:04,489 --> 00:58:07,481
How come you're
the walking one and only?

784
00:58:10,289 --> 00:58:11,847
I don't know.

785
00:58:14,369 --> 00:58:16,563
Do you believe in God, Captain?

786
00:58:19,690 --> 00:58:21,600
Yes. Yes, I do.

787
00:58:24,130 --> 00:58:25,529
How about you?

788
00:58:26,890 --> 00:58:29,245
Not in any way that helps.

789
00:58:33,571 --> 00:58:35,481
Look, I'm sorry, Captain.

790
00:58:35,811 --> 00:58:37,722
I don't mean to sound bitter.

791
00:58:37,932 --> 00:58:39,842
I should be thanking you.

792
00:58:41,092 --> 00:58:44,528
After all, you saved my life.

793
00:58:44,732 --> 00:58:47,963
The thing is, Johnson, um...

794
00:58:51,893 --> 00:58:56,841
Except for these dreams...
I've been having...

795
00:58:58,894 --> 00:59:01,805
I don't remember a thing
about what happened.

796
00:59:02,013 --> 00:59:05,050
Aw, well, hell, Captain,
that's a damn shame,

797
00:59:05,254 --> 00:59:08,802
cause you were an A-1,
Audie Murphy hero.

798
00:59:12,094 --> 00:59:14,324
Whatever they did to us,

799
00:59:14,535 --> 00:59:16,809
they did for a long time.

800
00:59:20,134 --> 00:59:22,853
Whenever I'd stop screaming,

801
00:59:23,055 --> 00:59:25,363
I'd hear one of the other guys.

802
00:59:27,495 --> 00:59:29,963
It seemed like we were there for days.

803
00:59:30,376 --> 00:59:32,412
You were on the cot next to mine.

804
00:59:32,615 --> 00:59:35,288
I don't know,
maybe it was sloppy,

805
00:59:35,696 --> 00:59:38,927
maybe they thought we were
just too far gone to care,

806
00:59:39,296 --> 00:59:41,332
that we wouldn't fight back,

807
00:59:41,536 --> 00:59:43,606
but they put
that machine gun down

808
00:59:43,817 --> 00:59:45,409
right across from your cot...

809
00:59:48,617 --> 00:59:50,811
And they left the clip in the gun,

810
00:59:51,017 --> 00:59:52,769
almost like they
didn't quite understand

811
00:59:52,978 --> 00:59:54,808
how a machine gun worked.

812
00:59:56,298 --> 00:59:58,528
Well, you sure as hell
showed them, Captain.

813
01:00:05,498 --> 01:00:06,931
Only one thing.

814
01:00:09,258 --> 01:00:13,251
You and I both know it wasn't
Germans you killed that day.

815
01:00:14,779 --> 01:00:16,929
It wasn't Germans at all.

816
01:00:21,899 --> 01:00:23,299
How are you coming with the canvass

817
01:00:23,659 --> 01:00:25,172
for the fifth occupant
of the craft?

818
01:00:25,580 --> 01:00:26,932
We haven't had much luck, sir.

819
01:00:27,340 --> 01:00:29,729
You might be interested to know
there was another live one,

820
01:00:30,060 --> 01:00:32,096
at least he was
when he was brought in.

821
01:00:32,300 --> 01:00:34,814
Our scientists have learned
that they have certain abilities.

822
01:00:35,021 --> 01:00:36,852
What kind of abilities?

823
01:00:37,061 --> 01:00:38,573
In good time.

824
01:00:38,780 --> 01:00:41,248
Colonel Campbell...
he's a small and petty man.

825
01:00:41,661 --> 01:00:43,174
I don't like him. He's an idiot!

826
01:00:43,581 --> 01:00:44,934
In an attempt to control

827
01:00:45,262 --> 01:00:48,219
the most important revelation
of the century, if not all time,

828
01:00:48,422 --> 01:00:49,934
the colonel
has confiscated the bodies

829
01:00:50,342 --> 01:00:52,492
and initiated
a high-level cover-up.

830
01:00:52,702 --> 01:00:53,929
He froze you out,

831
01:00:54,182 --> 01:00:55,694
just like he did to us in that field.

832
01:00:55,902 --> 01:00:58,814
He doesn't share the limelight,
and I'm not a person you freeze out.

833
01:00:59,023 --> 01:01:00,741
I'm gonna take
this project from him.

834
01:01:00,943 --> 01:01:02,934
In the process,
I hope to ruin his career.

835
01:01:03,183 --> 01:01:05,856
I will also take down anyone
who stands with him.

836
01:01:06,063 --> 01:01:07,461
I'm under the impression

837
01:01:07,663 --> 01:01:10,177
that the two of you
would never make that mistake.

838
01:01:10,583 --> 01:01:11,583
No, sir.

839
01:01:13,104 --> 01:01:15,776
If you were to have
a bit of luck in your canvass

840
01:01:15,984 --> 01:01:17,939
for what is now
the only live visitor,

841
01:01:18,144 --> 01:01:20,612
I would hope you'd share
that information with someone

842
01:01:20,784 --> 01:01:22,821
who's more forthcoming
than the colonel.

843
01:01:23,025 --> 01:01:24,980
- We would, sir.
- Yes, sir.

844
01:01:26,145 --> 01:01:27,145
Good, Howard.

845
01:01:31,225 --> 01:01:33,692
Oh, I mentioned that they
had certain abilities.

846
01:01:33,905 --> 01:01:35,941
Don't confine your search
to little grey men.

847
01:01:36,306 --> 01:01:39,298
Look for someone
who's a little bit more...

848
01:01:39,506 --> 01:01:40,825
human.

849
01:01:45,266 --> 01:01:47,939
Ah, this is beautiful country.

850
01:01:48,306 --> 01:01:49,944
I guess it is.

851
01:01:50,266 --> 01:01:51,938
Live in a place long enough,

852
01:01:52,306 --> 01:01:54,262
you forget to notice
that sort of thing.

853
01:01:56,147 --> 01:01:58,502
I think it's important
to always try and see

854
01:01:58,707 --> 01:02:00,743
as much as you can.

855
01:02:00,947 --> 01:02:03,507
Sometimes a person's life
can spoil the view.

856
01:02:07,468 --> 01:02:09,776
You're a really special woman.

857
01:02:09,988 --> 01:02:12,707
You need to believe me
when I tell you that.

858
01:02:12,908 --> 01:02:14,864
[CHUCKLES]

859
01:02:15,068 --> 01:02:17,457
You don't know
what you're talking about.

860
01:02:17,669 --> 01:02:18,943
Yes, I do.

861
01:02:24,149 --> 01:02:27,380
You know, I've...

862
01:02:27,589 --> 01:02:31,264
I've done some things
I didn't mean to do.

863
01:02:34,710 --> 01:02:36,302
You don't have to tell me.

864
01:02:36,830 --> 01:02:38,228
And I've...

865
01:02:38,751 --> 01:02:43,381
I've had to learn
to control my emotions.

866
01:02:44,711 --> 01:02:45,711
It's okay...

867
01:02:45,871 --> 01:02:49,147
It's all been worth it...

868
01:02:52,951 --> 01:02:55,067
Cause it brought me to you.

869
01:03:51,516 --> 01:03:53,950
Oh, I don't know
what's happening here...

870
01:03:55,877 --> 01:03:58,311
But I sure as heck don't care.

871
01:04:07,157 --> 01:04:10,512
And when the Indians
first saw the Spaniards,

872
01:04:10,718 --> 01:04:14,073
they thought
they were gods or devils.

873
01:04:14,478 --> 01:04:15,957
Because to the Indians,

874
01:04:16,318 --> 01:04:18,956
white man
did not look like man at all.

875
01:04:19,358 --> 01:04:20,756
I don't like him.

876
01:04:20,958 --> 01:04:21,958
I think he's nice.

877
01:04:22,398 --> 01:04:24,514
Ahem!

878
01:04:30,199 --> 01:04:31,393
[whispers]

879
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:37,674
Children...

880
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:40,393
these gentlemen are
from the United States Army.

881
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:43,917
They are searching West Texas
for a deserter.

882
01:04:44,120 --> 01:04:46,076
This man ran away from his post.

883
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:50,075
These men think he might be
hiding around here somewhere.

884
01:04:51,840 --> 01:04:54,308
If anyone has seen a stranger
