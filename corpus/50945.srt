1
00:02:32,767 --> 00:02:35,361
Craig, honey, it's time for bed.

2
00:02:38,807 --> 00:02:42,846
<i>Craig, honey, time to get up</i>.

3
00:02:42,927 --> 00:02:46,442
Craig, honey, time to get up.

4
00:02:46,767 --> 00:02:49,804
I'm sorry. I didn't know Orrin Hatch
was out of his cage.

5
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:52,555
- Come here. Morning, sweetheart.
- Morning.

6
00:02:53,167 --> 00:02:54,885
What are you gonna do today, honey?

7
00:02:54,967 --> 00:02:56,605
Working in the workshop.

8
00:02:56,767 --> 00:02:59,964
I was thinking, maybe you'd feel better
if you got a job.

9
00:03:00,687 --> 00:03:01,881
We've been over this.

10
00:03:01,967 --> 00:03:05,721
Nobody's looking for a puppeteer
in today's wintry economic climate.

11
00:03:06,727 --> 00:03:09,639
I know, honey, but I thought, you know...

12
00:03:11,007 --> 00:03:14,363
...maybe something else
until this puppet thing turns around.

13
00:03:14,447 --> 00:03:16,358
Derek Mantini doesn't need a day job.

14
00:03:16,447 --> 00:03:19,883
Not everybody can be Derek Mantini.

15
00:03:20,847 --> 00:03:24,317
I gotta get to the shop. We have
a shipment of kitty litter coming in.

16
00:03:24,407 --> 00:03:27,365
Will you do me a favor?
Will you take a look at Elijah today?

17
00:03:27,447 --> 00:03:30,837
- He's not feeling very good again.
- Which one is Elijah again?

18
00:03:32,207 --> 00:03:34,084
- The chimp, honey.
- Yeah, okay.

19
00:03:38,527 --> 00:03:41,644
<i>On the lighter side of the news</i>
<i>in Westchester County today</i>...

20
00:03:41,727 --> 00:03:45,276

21
00:03:45,367 --> 00:03:48,837

<i>"How public, like a frog</i>

24
00:03:58,607 --> 00:03:59,960
Gimmicky bastard.

25
00:04:03,407 --> 00:04:05,967
You don't know how lucky you are,
being a monkey.

26
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,885
Because consciousness...

27
00:04:09,687 --> 00:04:11,325
...is a terrible curse.

28
00:04:12,447 --> 00:04:15,837
I think, I feel, I suffer.

29
00:04:18,327 --> 00:04:21,637
And all I ask in return
is the opportunity to do my work.

30
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:26,165
And they won't allow it...

31
00:04:28,127 --> 00:04:29,845
...because I raise issues.

37
00:04:56,687 --> 00:04:58,279
Look, a puppet show!

38
00:04:59,607 --> 00:05:02,075
Okay, honey, just for a minute.
Mommy's waiting.

39
00:05:02,167 --> 00:05:06,319

Oh, Craig!

49
00:06:15,487 --> 00:06:17,443
Honey, not again!

50
00:06:18,287 --> 00:06:21,006
Why do you do this to yourself, honey?

51
00:06:21,447 --> 00:06:22,766
I'm a puppeteer.

52
00:07:51,247 --> 00:07:52,726
Seven and a half, right?

53
00:07:52,807 --> 00:07:55,116
- Yeah.
- I'll take you through it.

54
00:08:13,887 --> 00:08:15,206
Seven and a half.

55
00:08:16,247 --> 00:08:17,316
Thank you.

56
00:08:49,287 --> 00:08:52,165
Welcome to Lestercorp.
How may we meet your filing needs?

57
00:08:52,247 --> 00:08:54,807
No. My name's Craig Schwartz.

58
00:08:54,887 --> 00:08:57,037
I have an interview with Dr. Lester.

59
00:08:57,487 --> 00:09:00,001
- Please have a seat, Mr. Juarez.
- Schwartz.

60
00:09:00,807 --> 00:09:02,206
- Pardon?
- Schwartz.

61
00:09:02,887 --> 00:09:06,243
I'm sorry, I have no idea
what you're saying to me right now.

62
00:09:07,247 --> 00:09:09,807
- My name is Schwartz.
- "My name is Warts."

63
00:09:19,247 --> 00:09:20,316
Mr. Juarez?

64
00:09:22,167 --> 00:09:23,077
Yes?

65
00:09:23,167 --> 00:09:25,362
- Chest?
- I said, "Yes."

66
00:09:25,527 --> 00:09:26,880
You suggest what?

67
00:09:27,487 --> 00:09:31,844
I'm sorry. I have no time for piddling
suggestions from mumbling job applicants.

68
00:09:32,247 --> 00:09:34,477
Besides, Dr. Lester will see you now.

69
00:09:36,927 --> 00:09:38,724
Come in, Mr. Juarez.

70
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:43,360
My name is Craig Schwartz, Dr. Lester.

71
00:09:44,007 --> 00:09:44,883
Security!

72
00:09:44,967 --> 00:09:48,004
No, sir, it's just a little mix-up
with your secretary.

73
00:09:48,167 --> 00:09:51,045
My name is Craig Schwartz.
I tried to explain that to her.

74
00:09:51,127 --> 00:09:52,765
She's not my secretary.

75
00:09:53,087 --> 00:09:55,521
She's what they call an executive liaison.

76
00:09:55,687 --> 00:09:58,565
And I am not banging her,
if that's what you're implying.

77
00:09:58,647 --> 00:10:01,798
No, sir, not at all.
I think I must have simply misspoke.

78
00:10:10,647 --> 00:10:13,445
Well, now, tell me, Dr. Schwartz...

79
00:10:13,527 --> 00:10:16,246
...what do you feel
you can bring to Lestercorp?

80
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:19,797
Well, sir, I'm an excellent filer.

81
00:10:20,047 --> 00:10:22,766
Are you? All right. Let's see about that.

82
00:10:28,447 --> 00:10:32,281
Which of these two letters comes first?
This one or this one?

83
00:10:35,967 --> 00:10:38,527
The symbol on the left is not a letter, sir.

84
00:10:38,647 --> 00:10:40,046
Damn, you're good.

85
00:10:40,567 --> 00:10:42,637
- I was trying to trick you.
- I see.

86
00:10:43,007 --> 00:10:47,080
- Well then, put these in order.
- Yes, sir.

87
00:10:52,567 --> 00:10:54,637
Floris, get Guinness on the phone.

88
00:10:54,967 --> 00:10:57,242
<i>Yes, sir. Genghis Khan Capone. Fine</i>.

89
00:10:57,767 --> 00:10:59,041
Damn fine woman, Floris.

90
00:10:59,127 --> 00:11:02,642
I don't know how she puts up
with this speech impediment of mine.

91
00:11:04,487 --> 00:11:07,081
You don't have a speech impediment,
Dr. Lester.

92
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:10,156
Flattery will get you everywhere, my boy.

93
00:11:10,687 --> 00:11:13,326
I'm afraid I have to trust Floris on that one.

94
00:11:13,687 --> 00:11:15,439
You see, she's got her doctorate...

95
00:11:15,527 --> 00:11:17,802
...in Speech lmpedimentology
from Case Western.

96
00:11:18,407 --> 00:11:20,967
I apologize if you can't understand
a word I'm saying.

97
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:22,799
No, I understand perfectly.

98
00:11:23,767 --> 00:11:25,644
It's very kind of you to lie.

99
00:11:26,127 --> 00:11:28,004
You see, I've been very lonely...

100
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:31,363
...in my isolated tower
of indecipherable speech.

101
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:38,766
You got the job.

102
00:11:39,687 --> 00:11:41,757
- Any questions?
- Well, just one.

103
00:11:42,727 --> 00:11:44,638
Why are these ceilings so low?

104
00:11:45,007 --> 00:11:47,919
Low overhead, my boy!
We pass the savings on to you.

105
00:11:49,327 --> 00:11:52,285
But seriously, that'll all be covered
in orientation.

106
00:12:21,087 --> 00:12:23,840
<i>Welcome to the 71/2 floor</i>
<i>of the Mertin-Flemmer building</i>.

107
00:12:23,927 --> 00:12:26,122
<i>As you'll now be spending</i>
<i>your workday here</i>...

108
00:12:26,207 --> 00:12:30,200
...<i>it's important that you learn a bit</i>
<i>about the history of this famous floor</i>.

109
00:12:30,287 --> 00:12:31,959
<i>-Hello, Don</i>.
<i>-Hello, Wendy</i>.

110
00:12:32,047 --> 00:12:34,402
<i>Don, I was wondering, do you know why</i>...

111
00:12:34,527 --> 00:12:36,643
...<i>our workplace has such low ceilings? </i>

112
00:12:36,727 --> 00:12:40,242
<i>It's an interesting story</i>.
<i>Many years ago in the late 1800s</i>...

113
00:12:40,527 --> 00:12:44,122
...<i>James Mertin, an Irish ship captain, </i>
<i>came to this town</i>...

114
00:12:44,207 --> 00:12:46,721
...<i>and decided to erect an office building</i>.

115
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:50,163
<i>He called this building the Mertin-Flemmer</i>
<i>building after himself and</i>...

116
00:12:50,247 --> 00:12:53,284
...<i>someone else, who local legend</i>
<i>has it was named Flemmer</i>.

117
00:12:53,367 --> 00:12:56,643
<i>Well, one day, old Captain Mertin received</i>
<i>an unexpected visitor</i>.

118
00:12:56,727 --> 00:12:59,719
- <i>Captain Mertin? </i>
- <i>Aye. What want ye, girl child? </i>

119
00:13:00,407 --> 00:13:04,002
<i>I'm not a child, but rather an adult lady</i>
<i>of miniature proportions</i>.

120
00:13:04,407 --> 00:13:07,638
<i>I see. Well, if it's charity you're after</i>...

121
00:13:07,767 --> 00:13:09,883
...<i>be gone with ye, you foul demon! </i>

122
00:13:10,327 --> 00:13:12,124
<i>I'm not asking for alms, Captain</i>...

123
00:13:12,207 --> 00:13:15,119
...<i>but, rather, the ear of a kind man</i>
<i>with a noble heart</i>.

124
00:13:15,207 --> 00:13:17,846
<i>Well, speak then, if you must</i>.

125
00:13:17,927 --> 00:13:21,602
<i>Captain Mertin, I'm afraid that the world</i>
<i>was not built with me in mind</i>.

126
00:13:21,687 --> 00:13:24,281
<i>Doorknobs are too high, </i>
<i>chairs are unwieldy</i>...

127
00:13:24,487 --> 00:13:27,001
...<i>and high-ceilinged rooms</i>
<i>mock my stature</i>.

128
00:13:27,327 --> 00:13:31,161
<i>Why cannot there be a place for me</i>
<i>to work that's safe and comfortable? </i>

129
00:13:31,287 --> 00:13:33,517
<i>Thy story has moved me like no other</i>.

130
00:13:33,847 --> 00:13:37,681
<i>Therefore, I shall make ye me wife</i>.

131
00:13:38,447 --> 00:13:40,677
<i>And I shall build a floor for ye</i>...

132
00:13:40,887 --> 00:13:44,197
...<i>between the seventh and the eighth</i>
<i>in me own building</i>...

133
00:13:44,687 --> 00:13:47,997
...<i>so at least there'll be one place</i>
<i>on God's green earth</i>...

134
00:13:48,287 --> 00:13:51,199
...<i>where ye and your accursed kind</i>
<i>can live in peace</i>.

135
00:13:53,167 --> 00:13:55,556
<i>So that's the story of 71/2</i>.

136
00:13:55,847 --> 00:13:59,237
<i>Since the rents are considerably lower, </i>
<i>this floor has been adopted</i>...

137
00:13:59,327 --> 00:14:02,717
...<i>by businesses which have been forced</i>
<i>to cut corners</i>.

138
00:14:02,807 --> 00:14:04,957
<i>After all, the overhead is low</i>.

139
00:14:16,087 --> 00:14:17,486
Moving story, huh?

140
00:14:19,287 --> 00:14:21,437
Unfortunately, the story's bullshit.

141
00:14:25,407 --> 00:14:28,399
Listen, I'm Craig Schwartz.
I'm just starting out at Lestercorp.

142
00:14:28,487 --> 00:14:30,239
Where are you starting out?

143
00:14:34,727 --> 00:14:36,445
<i>Shut up! Shut up! </i>

144
00:14:37,207 --> 00:14:39,198
- Shut up! Shut up!
- Hey, shut up!

145
00:14:39,327 --> 00:14:42,205
- Shut up!
- I'm sorry, honey.

146
00:14:42,727 --> 00:14:43,921
Sorry, honey.

147
00:14:44,847 --> 00:14:46,041
Sorry, honey.

148
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:48,679
- Shut up!
- Sorry!

149
00:14:48,967 --> 00:14:51,606
- Help! She's locking me in a cage.
- Isn't that cute?

150
00:14:51,687 --> 00:14:54,679
- I just taught him that today.
- Yeah, that's adorable.

151
00:14:56,887 --> 00:14:59,640
- You want to do some dishes for me?
- Put that down.

152
00:14:59,727 --> 00:15:01,843
Here, Elijah. Here you go.

153
00:15:01,967 --> 00:15:05,562
You know, I have an appointment
tomorrow with Elijah's shrink.

154
00:15:06,087 --> 00:15:08,601
I think we're finally getting down
to the bottom...

155
00:15:08,687 --> 00:15:11,645
...of this acid stomach, aren't we?
Come here.

156
00:15:14,887 --> 00:15:16,115
Get down from the...

157
00:15:16,207 --> 00:15:19,279
She thinks that it's some sort
of childhood trauma.

158
00:15:21,407 --> 00:15:23,921
Feelings of inadequacy as a chimp,
you know?

159
00:15:25,167 --> 00:15:27,635
Careful. Isn't that interesting?

160
00:15:29,567 --> 00:15:31,444
I find it really interesting.

161
00:15:35,847 --> 00:15:39,157
So, honey, have you thought any more
about us having a baby?

162
00:15:43,327 --> 00:15:46,763
I think it's just so tough right now,
economically and all...

163
00:15:47,527 --> 00:15:51,679
...that I think maybe we should just wait
and see if this job thing pays off.

164
00:15:53,127 --> 00:15:54,162
You know?

165
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:03,687
I was thinking about what you said
the other day...

166
00:16:03,767 --> 00:16:06,759
...about the orientation film being bullshit.
- Yes?

167
00:16:07,087 --> 00:16:08,918
I think maybe you're on to something.

168
00:16:09,007 --> 00:16:12,682
- And 50 other lines to get in a girl's pants.
- No, no!

169
00:16:12,967 --> 00:16:16,198
No, I was just talking about the film.

170
00:16:16,527 --> 00:16:17,880
Here's the thing.

171
00:16:19,207 --> 00:16:23,564
If you ever got me, you wouldn't
have a clue what to do with me.

172
00:16:27,407 --> 00:16:29,796
I wasn't. I was talking about the film.

173
00:16:35,407 --> 00:16:38,717
What magic those fingers could work
on the right cabinet.

174
00:16:39,847 --> 00:16:41,803
Maybe you could alphabetize me.

175
00:16:42,567 --> 00:16:43,886
And don't forget...

176
00:16:43,967 --> 00:16:47,118
..."l" comes before "U."

177
00:16:49,447 --> 00:16:51,563
Floris, I think you're very nice...

178
00:16:52,447 --> 00:16:55,837
...but the truth is that I'm in love
with someone else.

179
00:16:56,847 --> 00:16:59,725
I'm afraid I have no idea
what you're saying to me.

180
00:17:00,607 --> 00:17:02,359
- You bastard.
- What?

181
00:17:03,687 --> 00:17:06,565
- Don't toy with Floris, Schwartz.
- No.

182
00:17:06,647 --> 00:17:09,445
If I was 80 years younger, I'd box your ears.

183
00:17:09,527 --> 00:17:12,087
I wasn't toying with her, sir. I wouldn't...

184
00:17:12,727 --> 00:17:15,195
- Pardon me. How old are you, sir?
- 105.

185
00:17:16,527 --> 00:17:18,438
Carrot juice, and lots of it.

186
00:17:19,127 --> 00:17:22,199
I swear, sometimes it's not worth it.
I piss orange.

187
00:17:22,807 --> 00:17:24,684
And I have to piss sitting down...

188
00:17:24,767 --> 00:17:27,520
...like a goddamn girly-girl,
every 15 minutes.

189
00:17:28,327 --> 00:17:29,965
But nobody wants to die.

190
00:17:31,327 --> 00:17:33,602
To be a young man again.

191
00:17:34,447 --> 00:17:36,597
Maybe then Floris would care for me.

192
00:17:38,327 --> 00:17:41,558
The elderly have so much to offer.
They're our link with history.

193
00:17:41,647 --> 00:17:43,956
I don't wanna be your goddamn link,
damn ya.

194
00:17:44,047 --> 00:17:47,323
I want to feel Floris's naked thighs
next to mine.

195
00:17:47,927 --> 00:17:50,157
I want my body to inspire lust...

196
00:17:50,247 --> 00:17:52,397
...in that beautiful, complex woman.

197
00:17:52,847 --> 00:17:55,725
I want her to shiver
with a spasm of ecstasy...

198
00:17:55,807 --> 00:17:57,843
...as I penetrate her wet...

199
00:17:57,927 --> 00:18:01,476
Dr. Lester, while I'm flattered
you would share your feelings with me...

200
00:18:01,567 --> 00:18:05,924
...the workplace isn't the most suitable
environment for this type of discussion.

201
00:18:06,007 --> 00:18:07,679
You're right. I'll tell you what.

202
00:18:07,767 --> 00:18:11,646
Meet me after work today
at Jerry's Juiceteria on Lex...

203
00:18:11,727 --> 00:18:14,161
...and I'll spill my goddamn guts for ya.

204
00:18:16,927 --> 00:18:19,964
No, I won't be late, Lotte.
I just have to, you know...

205
00:18:20,127 --> 00:18:23,676
...listen to Lester's sexual fantasies
and drink carrot juice for a while.

206
00:18:23,767 --> 00:18:25,439
It's a job thing, really.

207
00:18:28,327 --> 00:18:31,444
So, I'll talk to you later, okay?
Yeah. You, too.

208
00:18:31,887 --> 00:18:33,878
Gotta go back to work. Okay, bye.

209
00:18:36,287 --> 00:18:39,962
Hi. Do you know that I don't even know
your name or where you work?

210
00:18:40,287 --> 00:18:41,276
Yeah.

211
00:18:45,047 --> 00:18:46,241
How about this?

212
00:18:46,487 --> 00:18:51,117
If I can guess your name in three tries,
you have to have a drink with me tonight.

213
00:18:52,247 --> 00:18:53,236
Why not?

214
00:18:54,287 --> 00:18:55,163
Okay.

215
00:18:56,807 --> 00:18:58,206
You look like a...

216
00:19:02,007 --> 00:19:04,760
...Bar...

217
00:19:04,847 --> 00:19:07,725
...Ru...

218
00:19:07,807 --> 00:19:10,685
...Bell...

219
00:19:10,767 --> 00:19:13,486
...Carol...

220
00:19:13,567 --> 00:19:16,320
...Ta, Cher...

221
00:19:16,407 --> 00:19:18,602
...Susan...

222
00:19:18,687 --> 00:19:22,282
...Emily...

223
00:19:22,367 --> 00:19:24,835
...Marlar...

224
00:19:25,167 --> 00:19:28,045
...Maxine. Maxine?

225
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:30,597
Yeah! Who told you?

226
00:19:30,887 --> 00:19:35,039
Nobody told me.
That just came out. Isn't that odd?

227
00:19:36,647 --> 00:19:38,603
So where do you live and stuff?

228
00:19:39,407 --> 00:19:40,635
I am dubious...

229
00:19:41,167 --> 00:19:42,680
...but I don't welsh.

230
00:19:42,967 --> 00:19:45,606
Okay, meet me at The Stuck Pig, 7:00.

231
00:19:46,807 --> 00:19:48,445
If you're late, I walk.

232
00:19:48,887 --> 00:19:50,878
Nubile. Blonde.

233
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:53,442
Wet with desire. Me in leather.

234
00:19:53,887 --> 00:19:55,320
A harness, if you like.

235
00:19:55,407 --> 00:19:58,444
And all eyes, Craig,
are upon me as I speak.

236
00:19:58,927 --> 00:20:00,280
"Ladies," I begin.

237
00:20:00,767 --> 00:20:03,918
"I am the love god Eros." They like that.

238
00:20:04,567 --> 00:20:05,966
"I intoxicate you.

239
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:09,325
"My spunk is, to you, manna from heaven."

240
00:20:09,487 --> 00:20:12,479
Dr. Lester, this is all really fascinating
and stuff...

241
00:20:12,567 --> 00:20:15,286
...but I gotta get back home to my wife.

242
00:20:15,367 --> 00:20:17,881
- You have a wife. I'd like to meet her.
- Yes, sir.

243
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:19,798
Shall we say dinner Thursday?

244
00:20:20,847 --> 00:20:22,758
You can come, too, if you like.

245
00:20:22,847 --> 00:20:26,203
Get that? That was a joke.
You hear what I said? You can come, too.

246
00:20:26,287 --> 00:20:27,766
That was a good one.

247
00:20:27,887 --> 00:20:29,923
- All right. Thank you.
- Yeah.

248
00:20:39,087 --> 00:20:40,725
Maxine.

249
00:20:41,167 --> 00:20:42,805
- I made it, Maxine.
- Just.

250
00:20:43,407 --> 00:20:45,045
Buy you a drink, Maxine?

251
00:20:45,487 --> 00:20:46,806
Are you married?

252
00:20:48,967 --> 00:20:51,083
- Yeah. But enough about me.
- Yeah.

253
00:20:53,367 --> 00:20:56,484
- What'll you have?
- I'll have more of the same, please, Barry.

254
00:20:56,567 --> 00:20:59,320
And I'll have a light beer, or something.

255
00:21:03,647 --> 00:21:04,443
So...

256
00:21:06,287 --> 00:21:09,324
I don't know, I like you.

257
00:21:09,407 --> 00:21:12,080
- I don't know what it is about you. I just...
- My tits?

258
00:21:12,167 --> 00:21:14,442
- No!
- No?

259
00:21:14,527 --> 00:21:16,995
It's your energy,
the way you carry yourself.

260
00:21:17,087 --> 00:21:18,600
You're not a fag, are you?

261
00:21:18,687 --> 00:21:20,598
No. I am really attracted to you.

262
00:21:20,687 --> 00:21:23,076
"I am really attracted to you."
You are a fag.

263
00:21:23,167 --> 00:21:25,283
Well, we can share recipes, Darlene.

264
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:29,918
- Wait! I love your tits. I wanna fuck 'em.
- Now we're gettin' somewhere.

265
00:21:30,207 --> 00:21:31,401
Not a chance.

266
00:21:33,167 --> 00:21:34,885
So tell me about yourself.

267
00:21:36,327 --> 00:21:39,797
If you can get your mind
out of the gutter long enough, dog boy.

268
00:21:40,407 --> 00:21:42,284
Well, I'm a puppeteer.

269
00:21:42,567 --> 00:21:44,046
- I've been...
- Check.

270
00:21:52,567 --> 00:21:56,685
I'm sorry I'm so late.
Lester just wouldn't let me get away.

271
00:21:57,647 --> 00:22:00,957
Hi, Elijah. We're supposed to have dinner
with him on Thursday...

272
00:22:01,047 --> 00:22:03,163
...but I can get us out of it, if you want.

273
00:22:03,247 --> 00:22:07,001
It's amazing. He's like this insane old lech,
and it's kind of amusing...

274
00:22:07,087 --> 00:22:09,760
...once you get past
how disgusting it actually is.

275
00:22:09,847 --> 00:22:11,883
- Did you eat?
- No. I'm not hungry.

276
00:22:12,007 --> 00:22:14,726
I'm sorry I didn't call.
It was just hard to get away.

277
00:22:14,807 --> 00:22:16,923
- I was worried.
- I'm sorry.

278
00:22:19,767 --> 00:22:20,882
You know...

279
00:22:23,207 --> 00:22:24,879
...you wanted me to work.

280
00:22:28,367 --> 00:22:30,278
How was your evening?

281
00:22:31,687 --> 00:22:33,837
Tom-Tom's puncture wound is infected.

282
00:22:34,207 --> 00:22:36,562
- The ferret?
- The iguana.

283
00:22:38,447 --> 00:22:40,039
So I just dressed the wound...

284
00:22:40,127 --> 00:22:43,802
...and I've just been feeding everyone
and putting everybody to bed.

285
00:22:45,687 --> 00:22:48,724
- You want a beer?
- No. I think I'm going to go to bed.

286
00:22:49,247 --> 00:22:51,477
Elijah's gonna sleep with us tonight.

287
00:22:51,687 --> 00:22:54,247
- I don't think he's feeling very well.
- Okay.

288
00:22:56,687 --> 00:23:00,566
You know what? I'm gonna go
in my workshop for a little while.

289
00:23:00,927 --> 00:23:03,316
- But I'll be in in a little while.
- Okay.

290
00:23:44,127 --> 00:23:46,721
Tell me, why do you love puppeteering?

291
00:23:49,727 --> 00:23:52,560
Well, Maxine, I'm not sure exactly.

292
00:23:53,567 --> 00:23:56,843
Perhaps it's the idea of becoming
someone else for a little while.

293
00:23:56,927 --> 00:23:58,758
Being inside another skin...

294
00:23:59,527 --> 00:24:02,166
...thinking differently, moving differently...

295
00:24:02,687 --> 00:24:04,325
...feeling differently.

296
00:24:05,367 --> 00:24:06,800
Interesting, Craig.

297
00:24:07,927 --> 00:24:10,202
Would you like to be inside my skin...

298
00:24:10,727 --> 00:24:14,163
...think what I think, feel what I feel?

299
00:24:17,407 --> 00:24:19,398
More than anything, Maxine.

300
00:24:23,127 --> 00:24:24,799
It's good in here, Craig.

301
00:24:25,847 --> 00:24:28,315
It's better than your wildest dreams.

302
00:24:55,567 --> 00:24:57,637
<i>You're not somebody</i>
<i>I could get interested in</i>.

303
00:24:57,927 --> 00:24:59,406
You play with dolls.

304
00:25:00,007 --> 00:25:01,326
Puppets, Maxine.

305
00:25:01,607 --> 00:25:04,485
It's the idea of being inside
someone else's skin...

306
00:25:04,887 --> 00:25:08,084
...and seeing what they see
and feeling what they feel.

307
00:25:08,487 --> 00:25:09,397
Yikes!

308
00:25:09,847 --> 00:25:12,236
It's just that, well...
Please, let me explain.

309
00:25:12,327 --> 00:25:14,443
I've never done this before, but...

310
00:25:14,727 --> 00:25:18,322
...I feel something for you,
and I've never felt this way before...

311
00:25:19,087 --> 00:25:22,124
...you know, about anybody,
not even my wife.

312
00:25:22,927 --> 00:25:24,076
And I just...

313
00:25:24,767 --> 00:25:27,725
I really feel that you and I belong together.

314
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:54,803
Shit.

315
00:27:21,407 --> 00:27:22,760
What's the file number?

316
00:29:20,447 --> 00:29:23,484
You know what?
The puppeteer told me he loved me today.

317
00:29:24,207 --> 00:29:26,926
I know. I can't think
of anything more pathetic.

318
00:29:28,207 --> 00:29:29,276
I'm sorry.

319
00:29:31,607 --> 00:29:32,835
Afternoon, sir.

320
00:29:44,407 --> 00:29:46,363
The Broadhurst Theatre, please.

321
00:29:53,647 --> 00:29:56,525
Say, ain't you that actor guy?

322
00:29:56,607 --> 00:29:57,437
Yes.

323
00:29:58,567 --> 00:30:00,603
John, what is, John...

324
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:04,639
Don't tell me. Maplethorpe?

325
00:30:04,727 --> 00:30:07,958
- Malkovich.
- Malkovich. Right.

326
00:30:09,007 --> 00:30:11,601
Yeah. I thought you were all right
in that one movie.

327
00:30:11,687 --> 00:30:12,756
Thank you.

328
00:30:13,087 --> 00:30:15,362
The one where you played a jewel thief.

329
00:30:15,447 --> 00:30:17,961
- I never played a jewel thief.
- No?

330
00:30:18,967 --> 00:30:21,117
- Who am I thinkin' of?
- I don't know.

331
00:30:24,487 --> 00:30:27,081
No, no, I'm pretty sure it was you.

332
00:31:04,567 --> 00:31:06,000
Yeah. Absolutely, doll.

333
00:31:07,487 --> 00:31:11,765
I'm just about to close up.
Wanna meet at The Pig in 20 minutes?

334
00:31:12,687 --> 00:31:13,802
Cool. Bye.

335
00:31:15,127 --> 00:31:18,437
I'm splittin' for the day, puppet man.
Lock up for me, okay?

336
00:31:18,527 --> 00:31:20,757
Don't you wanna know
what happened to me?

337
00:31:20,847 --> 00:31:21,643
No.

338
00:31:21,727 --> 00:31:24,605
- Please, this is important.
- Better be.

339
00:31:25,127 --> 00:31:26,037
It is.

340
00:31:32,167 --> 00:31:34,601
There's a tiny door in my office, Maxine.

341
00:31:34,727 --> 00:31:38,640
It's a portal, and it takes you
inside John Malkovich.

342
00:31:39,207 --> 00:31:41,721
You see the world
through John Malkovich's eyes...

343
00:31:41,807 --> 00:31:44,275
...and then after 15 minutes,
you're spit out...

344
00:31:44,367 --> 00:31:47,006
...into a ditch on the side
of the New Jersey Turnpike.

345
00:31:47,087 --> 00:31:49,885
Sounds great!
Who the fuck is John Malkovich?

346
00:31:50,447 --> 00:31:54,042
He's an actor. He's one of the great
American actors of the 20th century.

347
00:31:54,127 --> 00:31:55,879
Oh, yeah? What's he been in?

348
00:31:56,447 --> 00:31:58,642
Lots of things. That jewel thief movie.

349
00:31:58,727 --> 00:32:01,480
He's very well-respected.
Anyway, the point is...

350
00:32:01,967 --> 00:32:04,197
...this is a very odd thing.

351
00:32:04,967 --> 00:32:07,800
It's supernatural, for lack of a better word.

352
00:32:07,887 --> 00:32:12,199
I mean, it raises all sorts
of philosophical-type questions...

353
00:32:12,287 --> 00:32:15,484
...about the nature of self,
about the existence of a soul.

354
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:18,201
You know, am I me?
Is Malkovich Malkovich?

355
00:32:19,607 --> 00:32:21,757
I had a piece of wood in my hand, Maxine.

356
00:32:21,847 --> 00:32:24,156
I don't have it any more. Where is it?

357
00:32:25,327 --> 00:32:27,522
Did it disappear? How could that be?

358
00:32:27,647 --> 00:32:30,480
Is it still in Malkovich's head?
I don't know!

359
00:32:32,447 --> 00:32:35,962
Do you see what a metaphysical
can of worms this portal is?

360
00:32:40,567 --> 00:32:44,560
I don't see how I could go on living my life
the way I've lived it before.

361
00:33:01,047 --> 00:33:01,684
Yeah?

362
00:33:01,767 --> 00:33:04,645
<i>So I've been thinking, </i>
<i>is this Malkovich fellow appealing? </i>

363
00:33:04,727 --> 00:33:07,525
Maxine! Yes, of course, Maxine.
He's a celebrity.

364
00:33:08,007 --> 00:33:09,838
<i>Good. We'll sell tickets</i>.

365
00:33:11,047 --> 00:33:13,436
- Tickets to Malkovich?
- <i>Exactly</i>.

366
00:33:14,007 --> 00:33:15,725
<i>$200 a pop</i>.

367
00:33:17,247 --> 00:33:20,478
But, Maxine, there's something,
I don't know, like, profound here.

368
00:33:20,567 --> 00:33:23,559
I don't know if we should exploit it.
You think?

369
00:33:24,967 --> 00:33:28,118
<i>I need you for this, Craigy</i>.
<i>You're my man on the inside</i>.

370
00:33:28,487 --> 00:33:30,876
You need me? I'm your man?

371
00:33:33,127 --> 00:33:34,355
<i>Sure, whatever</i>.

372
00:33:36,327 --> 00:33:38,557
Hey everybody, I'm home.

373
00:33:38,647 --> 00:33:40,842
- Treats for everyone.
- Maxine?

374
00:33:41,127 --> 00:33:44,881
- <i>Yeah? </i>
- We don't know the significance of this.

375
00:33:45,487 --> 00:33:47,557
It might be dangerous to toy with?

376
00:33:48,807 --> 00:33:50,877
<i>I'll protect you, doll face</i>.

377
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:53,436
<i>Bye-bye</i>.

378
00:33:57,367 --> 00:33:58,561
Who was that?

379
00:33:59,767 --> 00:34:03,123
I'm going to be working a lot of late nights
with this partner...

380
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:06,995
...'cause Lestercorp's open during the day,
so I'll be working a lot of nights.

381
00:34:07,087 --> 00:34:10,045
It's a good thing. It'll get us
out of the hole financially...

382
00:34:10,127 --> 00:34:12,322
...'cause we're gonna turn it
into a business.

383
00:34:12,407 --> 00:34:14,602
But I don't understand.

384
00:34:15,287 --> 00:34:19,599
There's no such thing as a hole,
or a portal into somebody's brain.

385
00:34:19,687 --> 00:34:23,475
Yes, there is. A brain or soul or whatever.

386
00:34:23,807 --> 00:34:26,196
I was inside John Malkovich lookin' out.

387
00:34:27,327 --> 00:34:28,442
- Really?
- Yep.

388
00:34:28,727 --> 00:34:30,763
- I wanna try it then.
- Pardon?

389
00:34:31,447 --> 00:34:33,961
I want to be John Malkovich tomorrow.

390
00:34:34,047 --> 00:34:36,720
That'd be perfect,
'cause then I can meet your partner.

391
00:34:36,807 --> 00:34:40,766
The thing is, Lestercorp's open during
the day, so we can't go during the day.

392
00:34:41,047 --> 00:34:43,686
But if you want to, we can do it right now.

393
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:47,040
- Now? Right now?
- Tonight, on the way to Lester's.

394
00:34:59,287 --> 00:35:02,802
I'll meet you on the side of the road
by the New Jersey Turnpike.

395
00:35:08,487 --> 00:35:09,602
I'm scared.

396
00:35:11,287 --> 00:35:13,437
You don't have to do this, you know.

397
00:35:15,847 --> 00:35:16,643
No.

398
00:35:17,447 --> 00:35:19,119
No, I wanna go.

399
00:35:20,047 --> 00:35:21,765
- You sure?
- Yeah.

400
00:35:41,767 --> 00:35:42,802
<i>It's wet</i>.

401
00:35:44,967 --> 00:35:45,877
<i>Weird</i>.

402
00:35:54,007 --> 00:35:55,156
<i>That's nice</i>.

403
00:36:03,687 --> 00:36:06,155
<i>God, I feel sexy</i>.

404
00:36:13,767 --> 00:36:15,439
Lotte, are you all right?

405
00:36:20,687 --> 00:36:22,518
Craig, I gotta go back!

406
00:36:22,607 --> 00:36:24,677
- No!
- Maybe tomorrow.

407
00:36:24,767 --> 00:36:28,726
- No! I gotta go back now!
- We'll talk about it later.

408
00:36:32,167 --> 00:36:34,237
Being inside did something to me.

409
00:36:35,367 --> 00:36:36,720
I knew who I was.

410
00:36:41,767 --> 00:36:45,043
It's like everything made sense.
I knew who I was.

411
00:36:45,287 --> 00:36:47,847
But you weren't you.
You were John Malkovich.

412
00:36:48,087 --> 00:36:50,726
God, I was. I was, wasn't I?

413
00:36:55,807 --> 00:36:57,320
I was John Malkovich.

414
00:36:59,567 --> 00:37:02,320
I was John fucking Malkovich!

415
00:37:06,367 --> 00:37:08,927
- Take me back, Craig.
- We're late for Lester.

416
00:37:13,687 --> 00:37:16,759
So tell me, Lotte,
can you understand a word I'm saying?

417
00:37:18,087 --> 00:37:19,964
Oh, yes, Dr. Lester. Absolutely.

418
00:37:20,047 --> 00:37:23,198
You were just explaining
the nutritional value...

419
00:37:23,447 --> 00:37:27,884
...of ingesting minerals through a colloidal
form which I couldn't agree more with.

420
00:37:28,247 --> 00:37:29,680
Be still, my heart.

421
00:37:33,927 --> 00:37:37,397
Dr. Lester, would you point me
in the direction of the restroom?

422
00:37:37,527 --> 00:37:41,486
With the greatest pleasure, my dear.
You go up the grand <i>escalier</i>...

423
00:37:43,007 --> 00:37:47,444
...and once atop the stairs you'll want
to enter the fifth door on my left.

424
00:37:47,687 --> 00:37:51,157
- Watch the step down. It's sunken.
- Okay. Thank you.

425
00:39:02,527 --> 00:39:05,963
What do you think Lester's relationship
with John Malkovich is?

426
00:39:08,687 --> 00:39:10,564
That portal's been boarded up forever.

427
00:39:10,647 --> 00:39:14,845
I bet Lester's not even aware of it, him,
the portal. Why?

428
00:39:15,447 --> 00:39:17,085
No reason. I was just thinking.

429
00:39:17,167 --> 00:39:20,842
Do you think that it's kind of weird
that John Malkovich has a portal?

430
00:39:20,927 --> 00:39:24,078
Do you think it might have some sort
of significance, for example?

431
00:39:24,167 --> 00:39:25,998
I don't know. Why do you think that?

432
00:39:27,007 --> 00:39:28,406
I don't even care.

433
00:39:28,607 --> 00:39:32,043
I think it's kind of sexy
that John Malkovich has a portal.

434
00:39:32,167 --> 00:39:34,397
Sort of like he's a vagina.

435
00:39:34,607 --> 00:39:36,643
It's sort of vaginal, like he has a...

436
00:39:36,727 --> 00:39:39,116
...he has a penis and a vagina.

437
00:39:40,047 --> 00:39:41,526
It's sort of like...

438
00:39:42,087 --> 00:39:43,964
...Malkovich's feminine side.

439
00:39:46,327 --> 00:39:47,476
I like that.

440
00:39:51,127 --> 00:39:53,243
"Visit J.M. Inc., Mertin-Flemmer Building...

441
00:39:53,327 --> 00:39:56,125
"...nightly from 9:00 p.m. to 4:00 a.m."

442
00:39:56,247 --> 00:39:59,125
Sounds good. Oblique, but intriguing.
Phone it in.

443
00:39:59,207 --> 00:40:01,038
- Want me to phone it in?
- No.

444
00:40:03,847 --> 00:40:06,281
- Lotte!
- Hi.

445
00:40:06,647 --> 00:40:09,241
- I heard your voice.
- What are you doing here?

446
00:40:10,647 --> 00:40:12,797
Is this your partner? She's pretty.

447
00:40:13,927 --> 00:40:17,283
I had to do the Malkovich ride again,
you know? Is this her?

448
00:40:17,487 --> 00:40:19,318
- Hi. You're Craig's wife?
- Yeah. Hi.

449
00:40:19,407 --> 00:40:21,204
Lotte, Maxine. Maxine, Lotte.

450
00:40:22,127 --> 00:40:26,279
- Have you done Malkovich yet?
- Hi. Yeah, I want to place an ad.

451
00:40:27,007 --> 00:40:28,918
Okay. "Ever want to be someone else?"

452
00:40:29,007 --> 00:40:32,158
No, that's the ad, but we can talk
about you in a minute.

453
00:40:32,287 --> 00:40:34,243
"Ever want to be someone else?

454
00:40:34,407 --> 00:40:36,716
"Now you can. Visit J.M. Inc.

455
00:40:37,367 --> 00:40:38,561
"Inc. Mertin.

456
00:40:39,007 --> 00:40:40,486
"M-E-R-T-I-N. Flemmer."

457
00:40:40,567 --> 00:40:42,444
You should really be at work.

458
00:40:45,567 --> 00:40:49,037
I've been going over and over
my experience last night, Craig.

459
00:40:51,127 --> 00:40:52,355
It was amazing.

460
00:40:54,567 --> 00:40:55,795
I've decided...

461
00:40:57,407 --> 00:40:58,920
...that I'm a transsexual.

462
00:40:59,007 --> 00:41:02,158
- I know it's the craziest thing, Craig!
- Are you fuckin' nuts?

463
00:41:02,247 --> 00:41:05,956
No. It's just that for the first time,
everything just felt right.

464
00:41:07,447 --> 00:41:09,005
I've got to make sure.

465
00:41:09,847 --> 00:41:11,963
But if the feeling is still there...

466
00:41:14,087 --> 00:41:17,921
...l'm going to talk to Dr. Feldman
about sexual reassignment surgery.

467
00:41:18,047 --> 00:41:20,766
This is absurd!
Besides, Feldman is an allergist.

468
00:41:20,847 --> 00:41:23,407
If you're going to do something, do it right.

469
00:41:23,567 --> 00:41:26,365
You get these half-assed ideas
and do a half-assed job.

470
00:41:26,447 --> 00:41:27,436
Just drop it.

471
00:41:27,527 --> 00:41:30,837
It's just that I really like Dr. Feldman.
All right?

472
00:41:30,927 --> 00:41:33,521
So I thought
that I would ask him his opinion.

473
00:41:33,647 --> 00:41:35,842
Is there something so terrible about that?

474
00:41:35,927 --> 00:41:39,283
- Why do you always yell at me like this?
- Sweetie, I'm sorry.

475
00:41:39,567 --> 00:41:43,606
It's just a phase. It's the thrill of seeing
through somebody else's eyes.

476
00:41:43,967 --> 00:41:45,366
Okay? Lt'll pass.

477
00:41:46,447 --> 00:41:49,359
Don't stand in the way
of my actualization as a man.

478
00:41:50,647 --> 00:41:52,046
Let her go, Craig.

479
00:41:52,407 --> 00:41:53,806
- Okay.
- I mean him.

480
00:41:55,247 --> 00:41:56,316
Right now?

481
00:42:00,527 --> 00:42:03,564
It's the middle of the day.
How will I get her past Lester?

482
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:05,285
- Yawn. Figure it out.
- Okay.

483
00:42:05,367 --> 00:42:06,720
Let's go. Come on.

484
00:42:07,727 --> 00:42:09,080
- Bye.
- Bye.

485
00:42:19,767 --> 00:42:21,086
Davey, it's Max.

486
00:42:22,247 --> 00:42:25,080
Listen, can you get me
John Malkovich's home phone?

487
00:42:26,247 --> 00:42:28,124
"But what I had been through.

488
00:42:29,047 --> 00:42:30,799
"I am hungry as the winter.

489
00:42:31,087 --> 00:42:34,762
"I am sick, anxious, poor as a beggar.

490
00:42:35,847 --> 00:42:38,156
"Fate has tossed me hither and thither.

00:42:38,647 --> 00:42:41,036
"I have been everywhere. Everywhere.

- <i>So strong</i>.
- "But wherever I have been...

00:42:43,647 --> 00:42:46,320
- "...every minute, day and night...

- <i>"My soul has been full</i>...

495
00:42:50,367 --> 00:42:53,643
- <i>"</i>... <i>of mysterious anticipation. "</i>
- "I feel the approach of happiness.

496
00:42:53,727 --> 00:42:56,161
"Anya, I see it coming."

497
00:43:01,167 --> 00:43:03,203
- Yeah?
- <i>Mr. John Malkovich? </i>

498
00:43:04,007 --> 00:43:06,567
- Yeah. Who's calling?
- <i>Oh, my goodness! </i>

499
00:43:06,647 --> 00:43:08,717
<i>You don't know me, but I know you</i>.

00:43:09,287 --> 00:43:11,164
<i>I'm a great admirer of yours</i>.

501
00:43:11,807 --> 00:43:13,604
How did you get this number?

502
00:43:13,687 --> 00:43:16,520
<i>It'sjust that</i>...

503
00:43:17,287 --> 00:43:18,561
...<i>I dream about you</i>.

504
00:43:18,647 --> 00:43:22,686
<i>And well, even speaking to you now</i>
<i>has gotten me sort of excited, you know? </i>

505
00:43:23,567 --> 00:43:26,127
<i>The way this woman's talking to him</i>.

506
00:43:26,967 --> 00:43:31,165
Listen, I really don't find this amusing.
Don't call here anymore, okay?

507
00:43:32,127 --> 00:43:35,039
<i>My nipples are at attention, </i>
<i>General Malkovich, sir</i>.

508
00:43:35,687 --> 00:43:37,040
<i>What, her nipples? </i>

509
00:43:37,127 --> 00:43:39,687
<i>So why don't we have dinner tonight? </i>

510
00:43:39,767 --> 00:43:41,723
<i>Bernardo's? 8:00? </i>

511
00:43:42,407 --> 00:43:46,161
<i>I really want to see you</i>.
<i>I just loved you in that jewel thief movie</i>.

512
00:43:50,807 --> 00:43:53,605
<i>You're not gonna meet her there? </i>
<i>Come on! </i>

513
00:43:54,047 --> 00:43:56,402
<i>Meet her. Meet here there</i>.

514
00:43:56,487 --> 00:43:58,318
<i>-Meet her there! </i>
<i>-"</i>... <i>as the winter</i>.

515
00:43:58,407 --> 00:44:02,161
<i>"I am sick, anxious, poor as a beggar</i>.

516
00:44:03,247 --> 00:44:05,920
<i>-Meet her there! </i>
<i>-"Fate has tossed me hither and thither</i>.

517
00:44:06,007 --> 00:44:08,282
<i>"I have been everywhere. Everywhere</i>.

518
00:44:09,607 --> 00:44:12,838
<i>"But wherever I have been, </i>
<i>every minute, day and night</i>... <i>"</i>

519
00:44:12,967 --> 00:44:15,481
<i>Meet her there. Meet her there</i>.

520
00:44:15,767 --> 00:44:16,756
<i>Yes! </i>

521
00:44:22,927 --> 00:44:27,159
- How was it?
- I have to go back at 8:00 exactly tonight.

522
00:44:28,607 --> 00:44:31,405
- Why?
- Don't crowd me, Craig.

523
00:44:40,727 --> 00:44:43,878
- Excuse me. Are you John Malkovich?
- Yes, I am.

524
00:44:43,967 --> 00:44:48,324
Wow. You really are great in that movie
where you play that retard.

525
00:44:48,407 --> 00:44:50,363
Thank you very much.

526
00:44:50,447 --> 00:44:53,245
- I have a cousin who's a retard.
- Thank you.

527
00:44:53,327 --> 00:44:56,603
So, as you might imagine,
it means a lot to me...

528
00:44:56,687 --> 00:44:59,155
...to see retards...

529
00:44:59,247 --> 00:45:02,284
...portrayed on the silver screen
so compassionately.

530
00:45:02,367 --> 00:45:04,835
Well, thank you very much. I appreciate it.

531
00:45:05,447 --> 00:45:06,596
Good night.

532
00:45:09,607 --> 00:45:12,804
- <i>Maxine? It's Maxine</i>.
- Hi.

533
00:45:13,647 --> 00:45:16,525
I'm so glad you decided to come.
I'm Maxine.

534
00:45:17,007 --> 00:45:18,645
I'm John. How do you do?

535
00:45:19,447 --> 00:45:20,323
Good.

536
00:45:24,047 --> 00:45:28,438
I wasn't sure I was going to come,
but I felt oddly compelled.

537
00:45:30,487 --> 00:45:32,239
<i>You're so beautiful</i>.

538
00:45:32,687 --> 00:45:35,918
<i>The way you're looking at me, </i>
<i>I mean, at him, at us</i>.

539
00:45:40,767 --> 00:45:43,759
<i>I've never been looked at like this</i>
<i>by a woman before</i>.

540
00:45:44,887 --> 00:45:46,400
<i>I think I'm sweating</i>.

541
00:45:46,487 --> 00:45:48,955
I must say, I was intrigued by your voice.

542
00:45:49,767 --> 00:45:52,156
And the funny thing is, Mr. Malkovich...

543
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:56,077
...my voice is probably
the least intriguing thing about me.

544
00:46:00,967 --> 00:46:04,118
So, I mean, how was it?
What was he doing?

545
00:46:05,287 --> 00:46:09,075
He wasn't doing anything, really.
He was just hanging around his apartment.

546
00:46:09,167 --> 00:46:12,876
I think he's probably
just a really lonely guy.

547
00:46:13,487 --> 00:46:17,639
See, men can feel unfulfilled too, Lotte.
I'm glad you're finally realizing that.

548
00:46:17,727 --> 00:46:20,036
You shouldn't assume
that switching bodies...

549
00:46:20,127 --> 00:46:22,595
...is gonna be the answer to your problems.

550
00:46:23,887 --> 00:46:25,957
You're right, Craig. You're right.

551
00:46:28,407 --> 00:46:31,205
You know what I was thinking?
I was thinking that maybe...

552
00:46:31,287 --> 00:46:33,847
...we should invite Maxine
over for dinner one night...

553
00:46:33,927 --> 00:46:37,556
...because you're partners and
I thought it might be a really nice gesture.

554
00:46:37,647 --> 00:46:39,877
- I think she'd like that.
- Maxine?

555
00:46:40,807 --> 00:46:44,163
The thing is, there's been some tension
between us at work...

556
00:46:44,447 --> 00:46:47,484
...business stuff,
and I would hate to expose you to that.

557
00:46:47,567 --> 00:46:48,886
It'll be okay.

558
00:46:49,207 --> 00:46:51,960
I'll cook my lasagna,
we'll smoke a joint, and...

559
00:46:53,727 --> 00:46:55,718
...tensions will just melt away.

560
00:46:56,887 --> 00:47:00,926
Now, when you say that I can be
somebody else, what do you mean exactly?

561
00:47:01,567 --> 00:47:03,603
Well, we mean exactly that.

562
00:47:04,967 --> 00:47:08,880
We can put you inside someone else's body
for 15 minutes.

563
00:47:09,727 --> 00:47:11,797
Can I be anybody that I wanna be?

564
00:47:15,847 --> 00:47:18,407
- Actually...
- You can be John Malkovich.

565
00:47:18,487 --> 00:47:22,878
That's perfect!
It's my second choice, but it's wonderful.

566
00:47:26,927 --> 00:47:29,964
I'm a fat man. I am sad and fat...

567
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:31,116
$200?

568
00:47:33,967 --> 00:47:34,797
Yes.

569
00:47:42,967 --> 00:47:45,401
Okay. You gotta crawl in there.

570
00:47:46,087 --> 00:47:47,202
Oh, my God.

571
00:48:04,847 --> 00:48:08,681
No, that's what I'm saying.
See, I don't really need an extra bath mat.

572
00:48:08,767 --> 00:48:11,520
So if I get the set, would it be possible...

573
00:48:11,607 --> 00:48:13,802
...if I could just get maybe three...

574
00:48:13,887 --> 00:48:16,276
...extra hand towels...

575
00:48:17,647 --> 00:48:19,877
...if I get the set, instead of the bath mat?

576
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:23,596
<i>-Yes, sir. Sure, we can do that</i>.
- Great. That sounds good.

577
00:48:23,687 --> 00:48:26,759
And for the color: periwinkle?

578
00:48:27,287 --> 00:48:31,360
<i>I'm sorry. We're out of stock in periwinkle</i>.
<i>Do you want to back order? </i>

579
00:48:32,127 --> 00:48:35,597
No. I'll go with the loden.

580
00:48:36,007 --> 00:48:37,918
<i>Would you like to order anything else? </i>

581
00:48:38,007 --> 00:48:43,604
What is the difference between
the foot-pampering, looped cotton rug...

582
00:48:44,687 --> 00:48:46,120
...and the bath mat?

583
00:49:01,087 --> 00:49:03,078
You're my friends. Thank you.

584
00:49:03,687 --> 00:49:06,997
Did you know that Eskimos have not one...

585
00:49:08,047 --> 00:49:09,082
...but...

586
00:49:10,127 --> 00:49:11,765
...forty-nine words for snow?

587
00:49:13,887 --> 00:49:16,117
It's because they have so much of it.

588
00:49:20,407 --> 00:49:21,601
So much snow.

589
00:49:23,847 --> 00:49:26,156
After dinner, I'll show you my puppets.

590
00:49:27,127 --> 00:49:30,244
After dinner, I'll introduce you
to my chimp Elijah.

591
00:49:32,007 --> 00:49:35,443
He has an ulcer right now
due to suppressed childhood trauma...

592
00:49:36,247 --> 00:49:38,238
...but we're working through it.

593
00:49:40,927 --> 00:49:42,121
Psychotherapy.

594
00:50:02,167 --> 00:50:04,476
- This the bedroom?
- Yeah.

595
00:50:07,327 --> 00:50:09,602
<i>The thing is, the way that I see it</i>...

596
00:50:10,127 --> 00:50:12,960
...I think the world is divided...

597
00:50:13,047 --> 00:50:17,723
...into those who go after what they want
and then those who don't, right?

598
00:50:17,847 --> 00:50:19,405
- Right.
- The passionate ones...

599
00:50:19,487 --> 00:50:21,557
...the ones who go after what they want...

600
00:50:21,647 --> 00:50:24,719
...well, they may not get what they want.

601
00:50:27,687 --> 00:50:30,485
But at least they remain vital.

602
00:50:30,567 --> 00:50:31,522
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

603
00:50:31,607 --> 00:50:36,761
So when they lie on their death beds,
they have few regrets.

604
00:50:37,607 --> 00:50:38,517
Right?

605
00:50:43,647 --> 00:50:46,400
And the ones who don't go after
what they want...

606
00:50:46,647 --> 00:50:50,117
...well, who gives a shit
about them anyway?

607
00:50:52,967 --> 00:50:55,356
- Lotte!
- Craig!

608
00:50:56,527 --> 00:50:58,324
I don't find you attractive.

609
00:50:59,327 --> 00:51:02,285
And, Lotte, I'm smitten with you.

610
00:51:03,207 --> 00:51:05,437
I am. But only when you're in Malkovich.

611
00:51:05,527 --> 00:51:08,963
When I looked into his eyes last night,
I could feel you peering out.

612
00:51:09,047 --> 00:51:10,685
- Really?
- Yeah.

613
00:51:11,007 --> 00:51:15,125
Behind the stubble and the too-prominent
brow and the male-pattern baldness...

614
00:51:15,207 --> 00:51:17,277
...I sensed your feminine longing.

615
00:51:18,407 --> 00:51:19,886
And it just slew me.

616
00:51:21,167 --> 00:51:22,282
Oh, my God!

617
00:51:25,127 --> 00:51:28,005
Only as John, sweetie. Sorry.

618
00:51:30,567 --> 00:51:32,478
Thanks for a wonderful dinner.

619
00:51:34,207 --> 00:51:35,925
No hard feelings, partner?

620
00:51:53,047 --> 00:51:54,002
J.M. Inc.

621
00:51:54,087 --> 00:51:55,406
<i>Hi. It's Lotte</i>.

622
00:51:56,207 --> 00:51:58,357
<i>I'd like very much to see you again</i>.

623
00:51:59,167 --> 00:52:01,635
<i>Can you call him and invite yourself over? </i>

624
00:52:03,487 --> 00:52:04,681
When?

625
00:52:08,087 --> 00:52:10,396
<i>Tonight after you close? </i>

626
00:52:10,487 --> 00:52:13,240
Okay, 4:11.

627
00:52:14,967 --> 00:52:16,320
4:11?

628
00:52:16,807 --> 00:52:19,446
- <i>Thank you, Maxine</i>.
- You're welcome.

629
00:52:47,967 --> 00:52:50,527
Thanks so much for having me over,
sugarplum.

630
00:52:50,767 --> 00:52:52,246
I'm glad you called.

631
00:52:52,607 --> 00:52:54,245
Shall we to the <i>boudoir</i>?

632
00:52:58,007 --> 00:52:59,998
A couple of minutes. I'm early.

633
00:53:15,007 --> 00:53:18,522
So do you enjoy being an actor?

634
00:53:21,487 --> 00:53:24,285
Sure. It's very rewarding.

635
00:53:41,447 --> 00:53:43,756
- Hi.
- Hi.

636
00:53:58,527 --> 00:54:00,165
<i>My sweet Maxine</i>.

637
00:54:01,087 --> 00:54:03,043
- <i>My darling</i>.
- I love you, Lotte.

638
00:54:09,447 --> 00:54:11,005
Did you call me Lotte?

639
00:54:16,487 --> 00:54:17,636
Do you mind?

640
00:54:20,727 --> 00:54:21,955
No, not really.

641
00:54:24,327 --> 00:54:28,286
- <i>Oh, God</i>.
- My sweet, beautiful Lotte.

642
00:54:28,367 --> 00:54:29,482
<i>Maxine! </i>

643
00:54:30,207 --> 00:54:32,562
Yes, Maxine. Yes.

644
00:54:32,687 --> 00:54:35,247
<i>Maxine, this is so right</i>.

645
00:55:22,847 --> 00:55:25,407
- You were him, weren't you?
- Yeah.

646
00:55:26,207 --> 00:55:27,686
And he was with her!

647
00:55:28,967 --> 00:55:30,241
We love her, Craig.

648
00:55:30,327 --> 00:55:32,443
- "We"?
- John and me.

649
00:55:32,527 --> 00:55:33,755
Don't forget about me!

650
00:55:33,847 --> 00:55:36,486
You have the Maxine action figure
to play with!

651
00:55:38,127 --> 00:55:40,516
I'm sorry. That was nasty.

652
00:56:09,127 --> 00:56:11,083
You are late, my little cowboy.

653
00:56:14,087 --> 00:56:16,078
Are you torturing me on purpose?

654
00:56:17,327 --> 00:56:20,717
- I've fallen in love.
- I don't think so.

655
00:56:21,327 --> 00:56:23,841
You know why?
Because I've fallen in love!

656
00:56:24,207 --> 00:56:26,721
This is what people
who've fallen in love look like.

657
00:56:26,807 --> 00:56:30,686
You picked the unrequited variety.
It's very bad for the skin.

658
00:56:35,167 --> 00:56:36,919
You're evil, Maxine.

659
00:56:37,567 --> 00:56:40,843
Do you have any idea what it's like
to have two people look at you...

660
00:56:40,927 --> 00:56:42,724
...with total lust and devotion...

661
00:56:42,807 --> 00:56:44,877
...through the same pair of eyes?

662
00:56:48,727 --> 00:56:50,638
No, I don't suppose you would.

663
00:56:50,847 --> 00:56:52,678
It's quite a thrill, Craigy.

664
00:57:39,287 --> 00:57:40,720
What are you doing?

665
00:57:41,087 --> 00:57:43,601
- Oh, my God! Is that real? What is that?
- Yes!

666
00:57:43,687 --> 00:57:47,726
I don't know how to use it very well,
so don't make any sudden moves!

667
00:57:50,127 --> 00:57:52,357
I'm serious! I'm serious.

668
00:57:52,927 --> 00:57:54,246
Suck my dick!

669
00:57:56,047 --> 00:57:58,641
Shut up, okay? Just shut up.

670
00:58:13,887 --> 00:58:16,481
- Craig!
- Tell her you need to see her.

671
00:58:17,407 --> 00:58:19,921
<i>J.M. Inc. Be all that someone else can be</i>.

672
00:58:21,447 --> 00:58:23,005
I need to see you.

673
00:58:23,087 --> 00:58:24,076
<i>Sweetie! </i>

674
00:58:25,007 --> 00:58:27,441
<i>I had so much fun with you last night</i>.

675
00:58:27,527 --> 00:58:29,483
<i>Shoot. But it's business hours</i>.

676
00:58:31,207 --> 00:58:34,802
Tell her, "What the hell,
close early, live dangerously."

677
00:58:34,967 --> 00:58:35,922
Say it.

678
00:58:38,207 --> 00:58:40,641
What the hell, you know?

679
00:58:42,647 --> 00:58:45,525
Live dangerously. Close early.

680
00:58:45,687 --> 00:58:46,563
<i>Doll</i>.

681
00:58:47,207 --> 00:58:49,721
<i>I love this new devil-may-care side of you</i>.

682
00:58:51,167 --> 00:58:55,445
<i>All right. I'll track down lover-boy</i>
<i>and see both of you in one hour</i>.

683
00:58:55,527 --> 00:58:56,721
Exactamundo.

684
00:59:04,767 --> 00:59:09,841
- What's the matter with you? Stop it!
- Sit up, okay? Just sit up. Just sit up.

685
00:59:17,607 --> 00:59:21,122
Help! He's locking me in a cage!

686
00:59:21,207 --> 00:59:23,038
Shut the hell up!

687
00:59:24,567 --> 00:59:26,239
Shut up!

688
00:59:37,047 --> 00:59:39,959
<i>"Was ever woman in this humor wooed? </i>

689
00:59:40,447 --> 00:59:43,564
"Was ever woman in this humor won?"

690
00:59:48,807 --> 00:59:50,718
Tommy, can I take 15?

691
00:59:52,767 --> 00:59:56,282
Good night, everybody.
See you back here at 9:00 p.m. tomorrow.

692
01:00:06,447 --> 01:00:08,722
Lotte, this is so good!

693
01:00:10,287 --> 01:00:13,438
<i>My God! This is amazing</i>.

694
01:00:13,887 --> 01:00:16,447
<i>I want to touch her breast</i>.
<i>Touch her breast</i>.

695
01:00:16,967 --> 01:00:19,003
<i>Move right hand across left breast now</i>.

696
01:00:19,087 --> 01:00:21,442
<i>Move right hand across left breast now! </i>

697
01:00:21,607 --> 01:00:23,677
<i>Move right hand across left breast now! </i>

698
01:00:23,767 --> 01:00:26,156
- <i>Holy shit, yes! </i>
- Holy shit, yes!

699
01:00:26,447 --> 01:00:30,235
- <i>Holy shit, he said what I said! </i>
- Shit, he said what I said!

700
01:00:30,327 --> 01:00:34,036
- Lotte? Is that you?
- <i>Yes, yes, sweetheart</i>.

701
01:00:34,167 --> 01:00:36,203
Yes, sweetheart, yes.

702
01:00:36,727 --> 01:00:40,197
What the fuck is going on?
That's not me! I didn't say that.

703
01:00:40,567 --> 01:00:42,080
- Lotte.
- <i>Maxine</i>.

704
01:00:44,967 --> 01:00:47,083
Something was making me talk.

705
01:00:47,167 --> 01:00:50,000
Some goddamn thing
was making me move.

706
01:00:50,087 --> 01:00:52,442
- I've gotta get out of here.
- Doll face!

707
01:00:52,527 --> 01:00:55,997
It was just your passion for me taking hold.

708
01:00:56,087 --> 01:01:00,763
No, doll face. I know what
my passion taking hold feels like.

709
01:01:00,847 --> 01:01:01,677
Bye!

710
01:01:02,207 --> 01:01:03,242
I did it!

711
01:01:04,607 --> 01:01:08,885
I made him move his arm
across your girlfriend's glorious tit!

712
01:01:10,567 --> 01:01:12,922
And I made him talk, sort of.

713
01:01:14,207 --> 01:01:16,846
It's just a matter of practice
before Malkovich...

714
01:01:16,927 --> 01:01:20,681
...is nothing more than another puppet
hanging next to my work table.

715
01:01:23,127 --> 01:01:25,925
I'll tell you about it when I get home, okay?
All right?

716
01:01:26,007 --> 01:01:28,567
Craig! I wanna...

717
01:01:38,687 --> 01:01:40,757
No, man, I'm sorry...

718
01:01:40,847 --> 01:01:44,965
...l'm sorry to have called you like that,
but I was just really scared.

719
01:01:45,647 --> 01:01:47,000
I was so freaked out.

720
01:01:47,087 --> 01:01:52,241
I mean, it was like, somebody was
just moving all the way through me...

721
01:01:52,367 --> 01:01:55,040
...moving my arms, moving my hands,
talking for me.

722
01:01:55,127 --> 01:01:58,164
I mean, literally,
I feel like I'm going crazy, Charlie.

723
01:01:58,247 --> 01:02:00,203
I'm sure you're not going crazy.

724
01:02:00,287 --> 01:02:04,121
You don't understand, man.
It was like nothing I've ever felt before.

725
01:02:04,207 --> 01:02:06,960
- Were you stoned?
- Yes, I was...

726
01:02:07,047 --> 01:02:07,957
Jesus.

727
01:02:10,087 --> 01:02:12,317
Yes, I was stoned.

728
01:02:13,007 --> 01:02:15,646
But that doesn't have
anything to do with it.

729
01:02:15,727 --> 01:02:18,082
Charlie, someone was talking
through my mouth.

730
01:02:18,167 --> 01:02:21,398
You were stoned.
Case closed. End of story.

731
01:02:22,927 --> 01:02:25,157
- How hot is this babe?
- You know what?

732
01:02:25,887 --> 01:02:28,276
Maybe it was this Lotte woman talking...

733
01:02:28,607 --> 01:02:31,326
...because it could have been her
talking through me.

734
01:02:31,407 --> 01:02:33,637
Because the weird thing is...

735
01:02:33,727 --> 01:02:36,195
...this Maxine likes to call me Lotte.

736
01:02:37,047 --> 01:02:39,322
Ouch. That is hot.

737
01:02:39,927 --> 01:02:42,919
Maybe she's using you
to channel some dead, lesbian lover.

738
01:02:43,407 --> 01:02:46,160
She's my kind of gal.
Tell me when you're done with her.

739
01:02:46,247 --> 01:02:49,956
What are you talking about,
"done with her"? Tonight freaked me out.

740
01:02:50,047 --> 01:02:53,437
You're nuts to let a girl go
that calls you Lotte.

741
01:02:53,647 --> 01:02:58,084
I don't know anything about the girl.
She could be a fucking witch or something.

742
01:02:58,367 --> 01:02:59,800
That's even better!

743
01:03:00,087 --> 01:03:03,318
Hot, lesbian witches.
Think about it. It's fucking genius.

744
01:03:05,687 --> 01:03:07,678
I gotta know the truth, Charlie.

745
01:03:08,967 --> 01:03:11,197
The truth is for suckers, Johnny boy.

746
01:03:53,807 --> 01:03:54,876
Thanks.

747
01:03:55,607 --> 01:03:56,642
This way.

748
01:04:41,967 --> 01:04:46,882
Excuse me. Exactly what type of service
does this company provide?

749
01:04:47,367 --> 01:04:49,881
You get to be John Malkovich
for 15 minutes.

750
01:04:50,407 --> 01:04:51,806
200 clams.

751
01:04:54,727 --> 01:04:55,716
I see.

752
01:04:56,647 --> 01:04:59,525
- No cutting, by the way.
- No cutting!

753
01:05:04,687 --> 01:05:07,884
Come on! Break it up!
Break it up! Cut it out!

754
01:05:08,047 --> 01:05:10,766
Everybody gets...
It's him. It's John Malkovich.

755
01:05:10,847 --> 01:05:13,645
Sorry, Mr. Malkovich.
Hope we didn't hurt you too terribly.

756
01:05:13,727 --> 01:05:14,842
Get inside!

757
01:05:16,607 --> 01:05:18,757
- Darling!
- What the fuck is going on?

758
01:05:20,447 --> 01:05:22,483
John Malkovich. Mr. Malkovich, sir.

759
01:05:26,327 --> 01:05:29,683
- Mr. Malkovich, I think I can explain.
- Yeah, explain.

760
01:05:30,247 --> 01:05:32,078
My name is Craig Schwartz...

761
01:05:32,407 --> 01:05:34,875
...and we operate a little business here...

762
01:05:34,967 --> 01:05:38,277
...that simulates for our clientele...

763
01:05:38,727 --> 01:05:40,365
...the experience...

764
01:05:40,567 --> 01:05:42,762
...of being you, actually.

765
01:05:42,967 --> 01:05:45,117
- Simulates?
- Yeah, after a fashion.

766
01:05:45,847 --> 01:05:49,476
- What exactly does that mean?
- Well, it's hard to describe.

767
01:05:49,567 --> 01:05:50,682
I want to do it.

768
01:05:50,767 --> 01:05:52,758
That'd pale compared
to the real experience.

769
01:05:52,847 --> 01:05:55,645
- I want to do it!
- Right now Mr. Hiroshi's in the tube...

770
01:05:55,727 --> 01:05:58,480
- Let him do it, Craig.
- Of course.

771
01:05:58,607 --> 01:06:01,280
Right this way, Mr. Malkovich,
compliments of the house.

772
01:06:09,567 --> 01:06:10,477
Jesus.

773
01:06:25,967 --> 01:06:28,879
What happens when a man
goes through his own portal?

774
01:06:30,247 --> 01:06:31,282
We'll see.

775
01:07:01,487 --> 01:07:03,045
Malkovich.

776
01:07:04,087 --> 01:07:05,645
Malkovich. Malkovich.

777
01:08:08,007 --> 01:08:10,237
- How was it?
- It was amazing this time.

778
01:08:10,567 --> 01:08:13,240
- That was no simulation!
- I know. I'm sorry.

779
01:08:14,527 --> 01:08:15,437
It's an honor.

780
01:08:15,527 --> 01:08:19,361
I have been to the dark side.
I've seen a world that no man should see!

781
01:08:19,447 --> 01:08:22,598
Really? For most people,
it's a rather pleasant experience.

782
01:08:22,687 --> 01:08:26,316
That portal is mine,
and it must be sealed forever...

783
01:08:26,407 --> 01:08:28,045
...for the love of God.

784
01:08:29,287 --> 01:08:32,597
But, Mr. Malkovich, sir,
with all due respect...

785
01:08:32,967 --> 01:08:34,798
...I discovered that portal.

786
01:08:35,287 --> 01:08:37,084
It's my livelihood. You understand?

787
01:08:37,167 --> 01:08:40,921
It's my head, Schwartz! It's my head!

788
01:08:42,367 --> 01:08:44,403
I will see you in court!

789
01:08:47,007 --> 01:08:49,919
What makes you think
I won't be seeing what you're seeing...

790
01:08:50,007 --> 01:08:51,156
...in court?

791
01:08:51,407 --> 01:08:53,125
Hey, Malkovich, think fast!

792
01:08:55,567 --> 01:08:56,443
Fuck!

793
01:08:57,727 --> 01:08:58,637
Dinner.

794
01:09:00,047 --> 01:09:03,164
You know, Craig,
once this was a relationship...

795
01:09:04,047 --> 01:09:05,400
...built on love.

796
01:09:06,287 --> 01:09:08,118
Well, you gave up that claim...

797
01:09:08,207 --> 01:09:11,165
...after the first time you stuck your dick
in Maxine, Lotte.

798
01:09:11,247 --> 01:09:13,317
You fell in love with her first, Craig.

799
01:09:13,407 --> 01:09:17,400
But I didn't do anything about it,
out of respect for our marriage.

800
01:09:17,687 --> 01:09:20,360
You didn't do anything about it, Craig...

801
01:09:20,927 --> 01:09:24,966
...because she wouldn't let you near her
with a 10-foot pole!

802
01:09:31,807 --> 01:09:32,956
That's true.

803
01:09:37,487 --> 01:09:39,398
God, Lotte, what have I become?

804
01:09:42,287 --> 01:09:44,278
My wife, in a cage with a monkey.

805
01:09:46,247 --> 01:09:48,886
I need to go to the bathroom
and take a shower.

806
01:09:55,647 --> 01:09:58,081
What am I, some kind of monster?

807
01:09:59,647 --> 01:10:02,366
I don't want to be a monster, Lotte,
I don't want to.

808
01:10:02,447 --> 01:10:04,802
Craig, you're not a monster. No.

809
01:10:05,367 --> 01:10:07,517
I know you're not a monster, honey.

810
01:10:07,607 --> 01:10:09,643
You're just...

811
01:10:09,927 --> 01:10:13,806
...a very, very confused man.

812
01:10:16,247 --> 01:10:17,965
I love you so much.

813
01:10:21,727 --> 01:10:23,319
I love you.

814
01:10:32,567 --> 01:10:34,046
Come on, Craig.

815
01:10:42,207 --> 01:10:44,198
- J.M. Inc.
- <i>Maxine</i>.

816
01:10:45,327 --> 01:10:46,237
Lotte.

817
01:10:47,287 --> 01:10:49,755
I've been thinking about us, you know?

818
01:10:49,847 --> 01:10:51,166
<i>We have to meet</i>.

819
01:10:52,247 --> 01:10:54,556
Okay, I'll see you in Malkovich in one hour.

820
01:10:55,087 --> 01:10:56,679
Craig!

821
01:10:59,447 --> 01:11:00,516
I hate you.

822
01:12:18,007 --> 01:12:18,962
Elijah!

823
01:12:19,287 --> 01:12:21,198
You really are magnificent.

824
01:12:25,367 --> 01:12:27,119
- J.M. Inc.
- <i>Maxine! </i>

825
01:12:27,287 --> 01:12:29,960
Honey pie! I was just heading
out the door to meet you.

826
01:12:30,047 --> 01:12:30,957
<i>Listen, Maxine</i>.

827
01:12:31,167 --> 01:12:35,126
It hasn't been me in Malkovich last time.
It's been that son of a bitch Craig.

828
01:12:35,207 --> 01:12:38,404
He had me locked in a cage with my chimp,
holding a gun to my head.

829
01:12:38,487 --> 01:12:40,205
- <i>Oh, my God! </i>
- He made me call you.

830
01:12:40,287 --> 01:12:42,721
<i>I'm sorry, Maxine</i>.
<i>It's been him the whole time</i>.

831
01:12:42,807 --> 01:12:44,604
I'm so sorry. That's horrible.

832
01:12:45,167 --> 01:12:46,919
I miss you so much, Maxine.

833
01:12:47,287 --> 01:12:48,515
So, but...

834
01:12:49,127 --> 01:12:52,915
...that was Craig inside of Malkovich?
- <i>Yes, it was him</i>.

835
01:12:53,007 --> 01:12:55,237
It's because he's a puppeteer, I think.

836
01:12:55,327 --> 01:12:56,646
Well, boy, I'm...

837
01:12:58,407 --> 01:13:00,477
I'm surprised. That's pretty impressive.

838
01:13:00,567 --> 01:13:04,355
- What?
- <i>So if Craig can control Malkovich</i>...

839
01:13:04,447 --> 01:13:06,961
...<i>and I can control Craig... </i>
- But, Maxine...

840
01:13:07,207 --> 01:13:09,482
...I thought it was me that you loved!

841
01:13:10,247 --> 01:13:11,282
I do.

842
01:13:16,047 --> 01:13:19,403
It's confusing, you know?
This is a very confusing situation.

843
01:13:20,487 --> 01:13:21,442
<i>I know</i>.

844
01:13:25,127 --> 01:13:28,676
Listen, I should really get going, okay?

845
01:13:28,767 --> 01:13:31,235
'Cause I'm gonna be late
for Malkovich now.

846
01:13:31,327 --> 01:13:33,477
- What?
<i>-We'll talk about this later</i>.

847
01:13:34,167 --> 01:13:37,523
- <i>Maxine! Wait! </i>
- Okay?

848
01:14:09,407 --> 01:14:11,125
What the fuck do you want?

849
01:14:11,847 --> 01:14:14,236
I can explain about the portal, darling.

850
01:14:18,127 --> 01:14:20,038
Listen, don't con me, Maxine.

851
01:14:20,247 --> 01:14:24,445
I don't know who the hell you people are,
but this insanity is now over.

852
01:14:24,527 --> 01:14:25,516
Shut up.

853
01:14:27,127 --> 01:14:29,482
Craigy. Craig.

854
01:14:29,887 --> 01:14:31,764
Schwartzy, are you in there?

855
01:14:36,607 --> 01:14:38,359
How did you know it was me?

856
01:14:39,047 --> 01:14:41,959
Lotte called me.
She escaped your evil clutches.

857
01:14:43,687 --> 01:14:46,485
Really? Well, I'm really sorry
I did that, Maxine...

858
01:14:46,567 --> 01:14:50,765
...but I'm really in love with you,
and I didn't know how else to be with you.

859
01:14:53,487 --> 01:14:56,081
Apparently you can control
this Malkovich fellow now?

860
01:14:56,167 --> 01:14:58,283
Yes, I'm getting better all the time.

861
01:14:58,447 --> 01:14:59,960
I'll say you are.

862
01:15:00,127 --> 01:15:03,199
Hey, let's do it on his dining room table.

863
01:15:03,687 --> 01:15:05,917
Then we'll make him
eat an omelet off of it.

864
01:15:06,007 --> 01:15:06,883
No!

865
01:15:07,167 --> 01:15:09,317
Shut up, you overrated sack of shit!

866
01:15:11,807 --> 01:15:12,796
Craigy.

867
01:15:37,087 --> 01:15:38,042
Yes?

868
01:15:39,447 --> 01:15:40,482
Hi, Dr. Lester.

869
01:15:40,567 --> 01:15:44,480
It's Lotte Schwartz, Craig's wife.

870
01:15:46,007 --> 01:15:46,723
Yes.

871
01:15:46,807 --> 01:15:49,037
Oh, my God.
You'll catch your death out here.

872
01:15:49,127 --> 01:15:52,324
Look at you. You're soaking wet.
Please come in, come in.

873
01:15:59,287 --> 01:16:02,040
- Here you are, my dear.
- Thank you.

874
01:16:03,767 --> 01:16:04,882
How's that?

875
01:16:05,367 --> 01:16:07,005
Much better, thank you.

876
01:16:07,567 --> 01:16:08,761
So, my dear...

877
01:16:09,527 --> 01:16:13,600
...what is it that brings you to my doorway
on such an inhospitable evening?

878
01:16:13,767 --> 01:16:15,200
Well, Dr. Lester...

879
01:16:15,647 --> 01:16:16,762
See, I...

880
01:16:18,487 --> 01:16:21,559
I have a very unhealthy obsession
with John Malkovich.

881
01:16:23,607 --> 01:16:24,517
I see.

882
01:16:25,127 --> 01:16:27,118
You mean, the performer.

883
01:16:28,287 --> 01:16:29,117
Yes.

884
01:16:29,487 --> 01:16:33,400
And what prompted you
to come to me with this issue?

885
01:16:33,807 --> 01:16:36,685
Well, when I was here
with my husband for dinner...

886
01:16:38,207 --> 01:16:42,246
...I came upon a room that seemed to be
some sort of John Malkovich museum.

887
01:16:43,287 --> 01:16:45,596
So I thought, perhaps, maybe you would...

888
01:16:45,967 --> 01:16:48,606
...have some appreciation
for my state of mind.

889
01:16:51,487 --> 01:16:53,398
You look so lovely, my dear...

890
01:16:53,647 --> 01:16:56,798
...standing before the fire
in my oversized man's robe.

891
01:16:59,607 --> 01:17:01,165
Thank you, Dr. Lester.

892
01:17:03,807 --> 01:17:04,876
Tell me...

893
01:17:05,847 --> 01:17:08,964
...what is this strange power
that Malkovich exudes?

894
01:17:09,927 --> 01:17:14,159
You've gotta help me understand.
All I think about is wanting to be him.

895
01:17:16,087 --> 01:17:18,396
- Wanting to what?
- Wanting to be him.

896
01:17:18,927 --> 01:17:20,758
Wanting to be John Malkovich.

897
01:17:22,847 --> 01:17:23,882
I see.

898
01:17:25,407 --> 01:17:28,046
Well, perhaps you can.

899
01:17:29,207 --> 01:17:30,322
But, Dr. Lester...

900
01:17:30,407 --> 01:17:33,524
I am not Dr. Lester.

901
01:17:34,247 --> 01:17:35,839
I am Captain Mertin.

902
01:17:37,367 --> 01:17:38,800
I don't understand.

903
01:17:38,967 --> 01:17:43,165
It was 90 years ago
that I discovered a strange portal.

904
01:17:43,407 --> 01:17:47,480
And I found that this portal led
to a vessel body...

905
01:17:47,567 --> 01:17:51,321
...and that I could live forever
by leaping from vessel to vessel.

906
01:17:54,767 --> 01:17:58,043
- So Dr. Lester is such a vessel?
- Yes, he is.

907
01:17:59,887 --> 01:18:01,525
You still there, sweets?

908
01:18:05,847 --> 01:18:08,964
I figured out how to hang on
as long as I want.

909
01:18:09,407 --> 01:18:12,399
It's all a matter of making friends
with the Malkovich body.

910
01:18:12,487 --> 01:18:16,685
Rather than thinking of it as an enemy
that has to be pounded into submission...

911
01:18:16,767 --> 01:18:19,964
...l've begun imagining it
as a really expensive suit...

912
01:18:20,047 --> 01:18:21,685
...that I enjoy wearing.

913
01:18:29,527 --> 01:18:31,358
This illustrates...

914
01:18:31,447 --> 01:18:34,723
...how I will move
into my next vessel, Malkovich...

915
01:18:34,887 --> 01:18:36,525
...on his 44th birthday.

916
01:18:36,967 --> 01:18:38,605
That's when he becomes ripe.

917
01:18:38,687 --> 01:18:41,406
But I must enter by midnight on that day.

918
01:18:41,527 --> 01:18:45,964
After that, I'd get diverted
into the next newly forming infant vessel.

919
01:18:46,567 --> 01:18:48,125
I don't want that to happen.

920
01:18:48,207 --> 01:18:51,836
- I'd be absorbed.
- Absorbed? What does that mean?

921
01:18:51,967 --> 01:18:55,926
Well, trapped, held prisoner,
if you like, in the host's brain...

922
01:18:56,327 --> 01:18:57,965
...unable to control anything...

923
01:18:58,047 --> 01:19:01,562
...forever doomed to watch the world
through someone else's eyes.

924
01:19:04,247 --> 01:19:06,397
Now I'd like you to meet some friends.

925
01:19:06,487 --> 01:19:08,682
See, I got lonely in Lester by myself...

926
01:19:08,767 --> 01:19:12,282
...so I figured out a way this time
to take others along with me.

927
01:19:12,447 --> 01:19:13,323
Come.

928
01:19:18,767 --> 01:19:20,723
Everyone, this is Lotte.

929
01:19:20,847 --> 01:19:23,998
- Hi, Lotte!
- She's a new friend of mine.

930
01:19:29,607 --> 01:19:32,485
Do a puppet show for me, Craig, honey.

931
01:19:33,487 --> 01:19:35,159
You mean, with Malkovich?

932
01:19:35,967 --> 01:19:38,162
- I'd love to see your work.
- Really?

933
01:19:41,687 --> 01:19:42,563
Okay.

934
01:19:51,607 --> 01:19:53,837
This is something that I call:

935
01:19:54,047 --> 01:19:57,676
"Craig's Dance of Despair
and Disillusionment."

936
01:21:26,487 --> 01:21:30,196
That was incredible! You're brilliant!

937
01:21:30,727 --> 01:21:34,003
You see, Maxine,
it isn't just playing with dolls.

938
01:21:34,887 --> 01:21:37,037
My darling, it's so much more!

939
01:21:37,127 --> 01:21:38,799
It's playing with people.

940
01:21:44,687 --> 01:21:46,166
Stay in him forever.

941
01:21:49,127 --> 01:21:53,882
How will we make a living
if our clientele can't access to our product?

942
01:21:53,967 --> 01:21:57,323
Well, we'll have all the money
in Malkovich's bank account...

943
01:21:57,727 --> 01:21:59,877
...plus he does get
acting work occasionally.

944
01:21:59,967 --> 01:22:01,082
No, please!

945
01:22:02,047 --> 01:22:04,515
Shut up! We're trying to think here.

946
01:22:06,847 --> 01:22:10,806
It is sort of like puppeteering.

947
01:22:11,487 --> 01:22:14,285
- I like that about it.
- Exactly!

948
01:22:15,687 --> 01:22:19,362
And no one would ever even
have to know it's not him.

949
01:22:22,007 --> 01:22:24,760
And I could use Malkovich's
existing notoriety...

950
01:22:24,887 --> 01:22:27,276
...to launch my own puppeteering career.

951
01:22:27,647 --> 01:22:30,286
Craigy, that's brilliant.

952
01:22:31,727 --> 01:22:35,515
So lovely. I've always wondered
what it would be like to have a penis.

953
01:22:35,607 --> 01:22:37,837
- Now I'll know.
- Really? I know it's very...

954
01:22:37,927 --> 01:22:40,566
Lotte? We like you.

955
01:22:41,367 --> 01:22:43,927
We can see you're a kind
and decent woman...

956
01:22:44,607 --> 01:22:45,756
...and so...

957
01:22:46,247 --> 01:22:50,445
...we've decided to offer you a place
in John Malkovich with us...

958
01:22:50,967 --> 01:22:52,195
...if you like.

959
01:22:56,927 --> 01:22:58,076
Dr. Lester...

960
01:22:59,047 --> 01:23:01,038
...you've been so kind to me...

961
01:23:01,567 --> 01:23:02,886
...and trusting.

962
01:23:03,527 --> 01:23:04,437
And...

963
01:23:05,607 --> 01:23:09,759
...there's something I think you should
know about the Malkovich vessel.

964
01:23:10,007 --> 01:23:12,043
<i>John's here to see you</i>.
<i>Should I send him in? </i>

965
01:23:12,127 --> 01:23:16,439
Of course send him right in. Don't ever
keep him waiting again, you understand?

966
01:23:19,127 --> 01:23:20,924
Hey, John.

967
01:23:21,207 --> 01:23:24,119
Great to see you.
Sorry about the cunt at reception.

968
01:23:24,447 --> 01:23:28,156
- This is my fiance, Maxine.
- Great to see you, Maxine.

969
01:23:28,247 --> 01:23:31,284
Sorry about the cunt at reception.
Please, have a seat.

970
01:23:35,967 --> 01:23:38,800
Can I get you anything? Coffee? Water?

971
01:23:39,247 --> 01:23:40,441
No, thank you.

972
01:23:41,127 --> 01:23:43,243
- Teresa, get me chicken soup.
- <i>Okay</i>.

973
01:23:43,407 --> 01:23:45,125
Chicken soup?

974
01:23:51,527 --> 01:23:55,361
Larry? I want to get right to the point.

975
01:23:55,447 --> 01:23:58,405
From now on, I'm no longer an actor.
I'm a puppeteer.

976
01:23:59,807 --> 01:24:01,001
Okay. Great.

977
01:24:06,167 --> 01:24:09,204
And I would like to redirect my career...

978
01:24:09,367 --> 01:24:12,120
...so that from now on
the name John Malkovich...

979
01:24:12,207 --> 01:24:15,005
...will be synonymous with puppets.

980
01:24:16,327 --> 01:24:18,124
Sure. No problemo.

981
01:24:18,207 --> 01:24:21,643
Poof, you're a puppeteer.
Just let me make a couple calls.

982
01:24:44,087 --> 01:24:47,762
Honey? Maxine?

983
01:24:48,527 --> 01:24:49,482
Maxine?

984
01:24:49,967 --> 01:24:51,002
I'm busy.

985
01:24:54,047 --> 01:24:55,765
Maxine, honey, it's on!

986
01:25:04,327 --> 01:25:06,602
<i>Yeah, there's the truth, and there are lies</i>...

987
01:25:06,687 --> 01:25:09,838
...<i>and, art always tells the truth, </i>
<i>even when it's lying</i>.

988
01:25:10,047 --> 01:25:12,163
<i>The enigmatic John Malkovich</i>...

989
01:25:12,487 --> 01:25:16,036
...<i>one of the world's greatest entertainers</i>
<i>and the man who reinvented</i>...

990
01:25:16,127 --> 01:25:17,606
...<i>how we view puppeteering</i>.

991
01:25:17,687 --> 01:25:20,247
<i>Tonight we look at the man</i>
<i>above the strings</i>...

992
01:25:20,327 --> 01:25:22,318
...<i>and the woman behind the man</i>.

993
01:25:22,967 --> 01:25:27,324
<i>Raised in Evanston, Illinois, Malkovich</i>
<i>had a lifelong interest in theatre arts</i>...

994
01:25:27,487 --> 01:25:30,126
...<i>and as a young man, </i>
<i>was one of the founding members</i>...

995
01:25:30,207 --> 01:25:33,324
...<i>of Chicago's world-renowned</i>
<i>Steppenwolf Theatre Company</i>.

996
01:25:33,407 --> 01:25:36,797
<i>From there, it was a simple transition</i>
<i>to Broadway accolades</i>...

997
01:25:36,887 --> 01:25:38,366
...<i>and Hollywood stardom</i>.

998
01:25:38,447 --> 01:25:42,406
<i>But nothing could prepare the public</i>
<i>for what was to come next</i>.

999
01:25:43,127 --> 01:25:45,561
<i>And so it was, </i>
<i>that just eight short months ago</i>...

1000
01:25:45,647 --> 01:25:48,764
...<i>John Malkovich dropped the bombshell</i>
<i>that sent shock waves</i>...

1001
01:25:48,847 --> 01:25:50,803
...<i>through the entertainment community</i>.

1002
01:25:50,887 --> 01:25:54,960
<i>Turning his back on his former profession, </i>
<i>Malkovich had to start from scratch</i>...

1003
01:25:55,047 --> 01:25:58,517
...<i>and pay his dues all over again</i>
<i>as a fledgling puppeteer</i>.

1004
01:25:59,047 --> 01:26:01,720
<i>Hello, ladies and gentlemen, </i>
<i>I'm John Malkovich</i>.

1005
01:26:05,247 --> 01:26:06,965
<i>I'm really John Malkovich</i>.

1006
01:26:07,047 --> 01:26:09,003
<i>From these inauspicious beginnings</i>...

1007
01:26:09,087 --> 01:26:13,239
...<i>John Malkovich's rise to stardom</i>
<i>was fast and furious</i>.

1008
01:26:13,327 --> 01:26:16,285
<i>His breakout performance was</i>
<i>at this year's Emmy Awards</i>...

1009
01:26:16,367 --> 01:26:19,279
It's really good! I look really amazing.

1010
01:26:19,447 --> 01:26:20,596
I'd fuck me.

1011
01:26:20,847 --> 01:26:23,077
<i>If there's anything that upsets me</i>
<i>about it</i>...

1012
01:26:23,167 --> 01:26:25,727
...<i>it's feeling like if I move</i>
<i>into it too quickly</i>...

1013
01:26:25,807 --> 01:26:28,162
...<i>l'll be, you know, deemed an imitator</i>.

1014
01:26:28,247 --> 01:26:31,125
<i>But, I think that</i>
<i>once we all get the courage</i>...

1015
01:26:31,207 --> 01:26:34,199
...<i>to follow through on our instincts, </i>
<i>like Malkovich has</i>...

1016
01:26:34,287 --> 01:26:36,881
...<i>I think that a lot of us</i>
<i>will move into puppetry</i>.

1017
01:26:36,967 --> 01:26:40,755
<i>Malkovich's rise to fame brought about</i>
<i>a renaissance in puppeteering</i>.

1018
01:26:40,847 --> 01:26:43,315
<i>No, no, no. What are you doing? </i>

1019
01:26:43,607 --> 01:26:45,006
<i>I'm making him weep, John</i>.

1020
01:26:45,087 --> 01:26:47,726
<i>You're making him weep, </i>
<i>but you're not weeping</i>.

1021
01:26:48,007 --> 01:26:49,679
<i>Don't ever</i>... <i>with your audience</i>.

1022
01:26:49,767 --> 01:26:52,725
<i>Until the puppet becomes</i>...

1023
01:26:52,847 --> 01:26:55,486
...<i>an extension of you, it's a novelty act</i>.

1024
01:26:55,567 --> 01:26:58,035
<i>It's Topo Gigio</i>.

1025
01:26:58,367 --> 01:26:59,163
<i>No? </i>

1026
01:27:02,367 --> 01:27:04,164
<i>He's a technical genius</i>.

1027
01:27:04,527 --> 01:27:06,916
<i>He breathes life into inanimate objects</i>.

1028
01:27:07,607 --> 01:27:09,643
<i>It's a very godlike thing</i>...

1029
01:27:09,727 --> 01:27:13,561
...<i>to be able to take something and, </i>
<i>you know, make it live</i>.

1030
01:27:13,807 --> 01:27:15,763
<i>He was the talk of the town</i>...

1031
01:27:16,127 --> 01:27:18,197
...<i>from the Beltway to Broadway</i>...

1032
01:27:18,807 --> 01:27:22,595
...<i>aided in no small part by his new wife</i>
<i>and manager, Maxine Lund</i>.

1033
01:27:23,287 --> 01:27:26,006
<i>In Maxine, </i>
<i>Malkovich had found his mentor</i>...

1034
01:27:26,087 --> 01:27:28,476
...<i>his muse, his inspiration</i>.

1035
01:27:29,047 --> 01:27:32,722
<i>In Malkovich, </i>
<i>Maxine had found the love of her life</i>.

1036
01:27:34,567 --> 01:27:36,603
There, there, my dear. Relax.

1037
01:27:37,487 --> 01:27:40,684
This travesty will all be over with
by morning.

1038
01:27:40,767 --> 01:27:43,327
<i>And the crowds have been</i>
<i>absolutely sensational</i>...

1039
01:27:43,407 --> 01:27:46,763
...<i>and I'djust like to thank God</i>
<i>for giving us this opportunity</i>...

1040
01:27:46,847 --> 01:27:48,678
...<i>to share our creative vision</i>.

1041
01:27:48,767 --> 01:27:52,123
<i>Nothing was impossible for John</i>
<i>and Maxine in the early days</i>.

1042
01:27:52,407 --> 01:27:55,843
<i>Their union was a joyous one, </i>
<i>and together they worked tirelessly</i>...

1043
01:27:55,927 --> 01:27:58,202
...<i>to further Malkovich's</i>
<i>puppeteering career</i>.

1044
01:27:58,287 --> 01:28:00,164
<i>John Malkovich, the artist</i>...

1045
01:28:00,567 --> 01:28:02,717
...<i>and Maxine, the entrepreneur</i>...

1046
01:28:02,887 --> 01:28:04,923
...<i>they make this character</i>...

1047
01:28:05,007 --> 01:28:08,283
...<i>this protean figure</i>
<i>that we call John Malkovich</i>.

1048
01:28:08,487 --> 01:28:12,002
<i>But some say Maxine has changed</i>
<i>since becoming pregnant</i>...

1049
01:28:12,567 --> 01:28:14,523
...<i>recoiling from the limelight</i>...

1050
01:28:14,607 --> 01:28:17,679
...<i>and, rumor has it, </i>
<i>from her husband's affections</i>.

1051
01:28:26,127 --> 01:28:27,401
I'm so sorry.

1052
01:28:33,367 --> 01:28:35,756
<i>Malkovich shows us</i>...

1053
01:28:36,287 --> 01:28:39,597
...<i>a reflection of ourselves, our frailties</i>...

1054
01:28:39,687 --> 01:28:44,807
...<i>and our, you know, desperate humanity</i>.

1055
01:28:45,287 --> 01:28:48,916
<i>That's what makes him one</i>
<i>of the most relevant artists of our time</i>.

1056
01:28:49,927 --> 01:28:53,158
<i>And what does the future hold</i>
<i>for John Horatio Malkovich? </i>

1057
01:28:53,527 --> 01:28:57,725
<i>Well, to quote the Bard, </i>
<i>"He's got the world on a string. "</i>

1058
01:28:57,887 --> 01:29:02,961
<i>As the poet said, "The puppeteer's voice</i>
<i>need not merely be the record of man</i>.

1059
01:29:03,047 --> 01:29:05,242
<i>"It can be one of the pillars, the props</i>...

1060
01:29:05,327 --> 01:29:08,399
<i>"</i>... <i>to help him endure and prevail,"</i>
<i>and I believe that</i>.

1061
01:29:09,847 --> 01:29:10,916
It's over!

1062
01:29:13,527 --> 01:29:14,357
Max?

1063
01:29:15,447 --> 01:29:17,677
I've gotta head down to ABT now.

1064
01:29:18,167 --> 01:29:20,920
I've got the "Swan Lake" benefit tonight.

1065
01:29:21,007 --> 01:29:23,885
But when I come back,
we can maybe celebrate...

1066
01:29:23,967 --> 01:29:26,197
...Malkovich's big four-four.

1067
01:29:27,447 --> 01:29:28,323
Okay?

1068
01:29:29,327 --> 01:29:32,842
Jesus! Why couldn't I have found
the portal to a younger body?

1069
01:29:33,087 --> 01:29:35,647
What if I fall tonight and break my hip?

1070
01:30:25,207 --> 01:30:26,845
Like that, little girl?

1071
01:30:28,607 --> 01:30:29,676
Huh, lamb?

1072
01:30:32,167 --> 01:30:33,316
I love you.

1073
01:31:06,607 --> 01:31:07,756
Bravo!

1074
01:31:15,207 --> 01:31:16,162
Maxine?

1075
01:31:35,567 --> 01:31:37,205
Hello? Hello?

1076
01:31:37,527 --> 01:31:39,677
- <i>We have Maxine</i>.
- Oh, my God.

1077
01:31:39,767 --> 01:31:41,723
Please, please, don't hurt her.

1078
01:31:42,087 --> 01:31:45,124
Listen, I'll give you
anything you want. Please.

1079
01:31:45,287 --> 01:31:48,199
<i>You listen to me, asshole</i>.
<i>I don't want your fucking money</i>.

1080
01:31:48,287 --> 01:31:51,165
<i>What I want is for you</i>
<i>to leave John Malkovich now! </i>

1081
01:31:52,407 --> 01:31:54,637
- Who is this, Lester?
<i>-Does it matter? </i>

1082
01:31:54,967 --> 01:31:58,403
<i>We're gonna kill Maxine</i>
<i>if you don't leave the body immediately! </i>

1083
01:31:58,487 --> 01:32:00,364
But I can't do that.

1084
01:32:00,687 --> 01:32:04,362
I mean, if I leave Malkovich,
then I'm Craig Schwartz again.

1085
01:32:04,447 --> 01:32:07,280
No career, no money.
Maxine will have nothing to do...

1086
01:32:07,367 --> 01:32:09,517
She barely has anything
to do with me now.

1087
01:32:09,607 --> 01:32:12,804
<i>Jesus, we're going to kill your wife, </i>
<i>you fucking lunatic! </i>

1088
01:32:14,487 --> 01:32:15,317
God.

1089
01:32:15,407 --> 01:32:18,365
<i>Listen, Schwartz, Malkovich is our vessel</i>.
<i>We're old</i>.

1090
01:32:18,447 --> 01:32:21,439
<i>We're going to die if we don't</i>
<i>get into him by midnight... </i>

1091
01:32:36,567 --> 01:32:38,046
He called our bluff.

1092
01:32:40,447 --> 01:32:41,277
Shit!

1093
01:32:42,407 --> 01:32:45,479
Can't we just go inside the portal
and push Craig out?

1094
01:32:45,607 --> 01:32:47,404
No, he's much too powerful.

1095
01:32:47,487 --> 01:32:50,877
Schwartz would just jam us down
into Malkovich's subconscious.

1096
01:33:14,487 --> 01:33:15,397
Lotte.

1097
01:33:19,247 --> 01:33:21,761
If I can't have you, no one will.

1098
01:33:24,487 --> 01:33:25,886
Lotte, no!

1099
01:33:27,367 --> 01:33:30,006
No, Lotte!
God, no, we can't really kill her!

1100
01:33:30,127 --> 01:33:33,722
She's carrying Malkovich's seed!
My next vessel!

1101
01:33:41,367 --> 01:33:43,039
Hey! Help me!

1102
01:33:46,887 --> 01:33:50,357
- Where the fuck am I?
- We're in Malkovich's subconscious.

1103
01:33:51,247 --> 01:33:53,556
The last thing you'll ever see, Maxine.

1104
01:33:56,007 --> 01:33:57,156
Fag-o-vitch!

1105
01:33:57,767 --> 01:33:59,246
Johnny, baby, Johnny.

1106
01:34:04,007 --> 01:34:05,998
Bad. I am bad. I am bad.

1107
01:34:28,767 --> 01:34:31,201
Maxine, I am gonna kill you!

1108
01:34:35,127 --> 01:34:36,276
<i>You're creepy</i>.

1109
01:34:47,167 --> 01:34:48,998
"Little Johnny Malk-o-pee!"

1110
01:35:16,487 --> 01:35:18,398
I loved you so much!

1111
01:35:20,047 --> 01:35:23,084
Why did you have to hurt me like that?

1112
01:35:23,567 --> 01:35:24,920
I'm sorry, Lotte.

1113
01:35:25,407 --> 01:35:29,082
I guess I loved you, too, in my way.

1114
01:35:29,687 --> 01:35:33,396
You are so full of shit, Maxine!

1115
01:35:34,007 --> 01:35:34,962
I know.

1116
01:35:36,327 --> 01:35:37,282
I know!

1117
01:35:42,167 --> 01:35:43,680
It's your baby, okay?

1118
01:35:44,927 --> 01:35:45,803
What?

1119
01:35:46,847 --> 01:35:49,407
The baby, it's yours.

1120
01:35:50,727 --> 01:35:53,764
It's ours. I got pregnant
when you were in Malkovich.

1121
01:35:54,047 --> 01:35:57,483
- You can't fuck with me any more, Maxine!
- I'm not!

1122
01:35:58,847 --> 01:36:01,486
I kept it because I knew
you were the father...

1123
01:36:04,487 --> 01:36:06,205
...the other mother, whatever...

1124
01:36:06,287 --> 01:36:08,403
...because it was yours.

1125
01:36:11,847 --> 01:36:13,200
So, we're parents?

1126
01:36:15,567 --> 01:36:16,602
Together?

1127
01:36:19,007 --> 01:36:19,883
Yeah.

1128
01:36:41,127 --> 01:36:43,197
- Aren't you John Malkovich?
- No.

1129
01:36:43,487 --> 01:36:44,920
- Yeah, you are.
- No.

1130
01:36:45,887 --> 01:36:48,117
I can't believe you're in this shithole, man.

1131
01:36:48,207 --> 01:36:51,438
- This is John Malkovich.
- I'm not John Malkovich.

1132
01:36:51,527 --> 01:36:55,281
- This is John Malkovich.
- I am not John Malkovich!

1133
01:37:11,407 --> 01:37:12,203
Yes?

1134
01:37:12,287 --> 01:37:15,245
<i>Lester, please don't do it</i>.
<i>Please don't kill Maxine</i>.

1135
01:37:15,327 --> 01:37:18,239
- So you'll leave?
<i>-Yes, I am leaving</i>.

1136
01:37:18,447 --> 01:37:21,803
All right. Do it now
while I'm on the phone so I can hear...

1137
01:37:22,407 --> 01:37:24,159
...and your lovely bride walks.

1138
01:37:24,847 --> 01:37:26,803
Okay. Okay.

1139
01:37:27,607 --> 01:37:28,676
I'm going.

1140
01:37:38,727 --> 01:37:41,195
Now, my friends. The time is now.

1141
01:38:12,487 --> 01:38:13,476
I'm free.

1142
01:38:17,527 --> 01:38:19,483
I'm back!

1143
01:38:35,287 --> 01:38:36,481
Lotte.

1144
01:39:12,087 --> 01:39:13,884
Hello. Hello, young lady.

1145
01:39:17,687 --> 01:39:19,882
We're Malkovich.

1146
01:39:22,887 --> 01:39:24,878
Maxine! I did it, Maxine!

1147
01:39:25,207 --> 01:39:27,084
I left Malkovich for you, sweetie!

1148
01:39:27,167 --> 01:39:29,283
It's no good being Malkovich without you.

1149
01:39:29,367 --> 01:39:31,244
- It proves I love you!
- Fuck off!

1150
01:39:31,327 --> 01:39:33,238
- Doesn't it?
- He's not with us.

1151
01:39:43,087 --> 01:39:45,043
Maxine, I love you!

1152
01:39:46,047 --> 01:39:48,959
I'm gonna go right back into Malkovich,
and kick Lester out!

1153
01:39:49,047 --> 01:39:51,515
And then you'll love me again! Maxine!

1154
01:40:06,887 --> 01:40:09,879
- Machine.
- Hey. Malcatraz.

1155
01:40:11,287 --> 01:40:13,278
- How are you?
- I'm very well. And you?

1156
01:40:13,367 --> 01:40:14,925
- Good, good.
- You look well.

1157
01:40:15,007 --> 01:40:16,725
Thank you. How's Celeste?

1158
01:40:16,847 --> 01:40:19,441
She's good.
She's sorry she couldn't make it today.

1159
01:40:19,527 --> 01:40:21,643
- She had to go to the store.
- That's okay.

1160
01:40:21,727 --> 01:40:24,241
Charlie, hi! I didn't even hear the door.

1161
01:40:24,407 --> 01:40:27,717
- Lookin' great, Flo.
- I'm looking grateful?

1162
01:40:30,247 --> 01:40:32,636
Charlie, we are not getting any younger.

1163
01:40:33,327 --> 01:40:34,885
Well, don't rub it in.

1164
01:40:35,647 --> 01:40:38,400
Listen, Charlie,
I know this is going to sound crazy...

1165
01:40:38,487 --> 01:40:41,604
...but what would you think
if I told you that I'd found a way...

1166
01:40:41,687 --> 01:40:43,518
...for us to live forever?

1167

Celeste, Floris, you, me.
Gary Sinise, maybe.

01:40:54,127 --> 01:40:55,845
I don't really understand.

1171
01:41:02,967 --> 01:41:06,437
Charlie, this is Emily.

Are you gonna throw up?
Are you gonna vomit?

Okay, you can swim.
