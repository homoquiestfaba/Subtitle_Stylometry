about whatever deal he made

You, uh, own a house one block

A house people might actually
want to live in.

00:07:15,442 --> 00:07:16,576
More illegal than nepotism?

140

Nepotism isn't illegal.

for the people
of the 18th ward.

What have you been doing
to improve the lives

152
00:07:37,863 --> 00:07:39,064
of the people of Chicago?

153
00:07:39,298 --> 00:07:41,166
I bet your reputation's
a real problem

154
00:07:41,168 --> 00:07:42,201
for your communications team.

155
00:07:42,435 --> 00:07:44,637
Maybe you the one who need
the communications team.

makes a $104,000 a year.

Shit, we make
more than that in a week.

But then you add in
the juice, right?

- thank you.
- The Green Line

to business like this

598

can take tired workers home.

of infrastructure

about this neighborhood.

overlooked for so long.

2058
02:02:16,002 --> 02:02:20,039
"Come on, you guys.
The season is just starting."

2059
02:02:28,782 --> 02:02:30,184

02:02:30,650 --> 02:02:31,885
- Uh-huh.
- WOMAN: Yeah?

2061
02:02:32,118 --> 02:02:34,419

VERONICA:
I want you to listen to me.

2069
02:02:57,010 --> 02:02:59,813

2070
02:03:00,846 --> 02:03:02,780
I want you to use that money

2071
02:03:02,782 --> 02:03:04,885
to help rebuild
the school library.

2072
02:03:06,351 --> 02:03:07,520
All I ask...

2073
