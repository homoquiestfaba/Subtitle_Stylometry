1
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:20,437
Are you sure I will not get into trouble, Bill?

2
00:01:22,099 --> 00:01:23,887
Don't be a wu-wu-wuss

3
00:01:24,233 --> 00:01:28,012
I'd come with you if I weren't (coughing) dying

4
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:30,429
You're not dying!

5
00:01:31,097 --> 00:01:34,204
you didn't see the v-v-vomit coming out of my nose this morning?

6
00:01:34,539 --> 00:01:36,771
That's disgusting

7
00:01:38,169 --> 00:01:40,069
Ok, go get the wax

8
00:01:41,881 --> 00:01:43,383
In the cellar?

9
00:01:43,582 --> 00:01:46,325
You want to fl-fl-float, dont' you?

10
00:01:46,824 --> 00:01:48,304
(whining) Fine

11
00:02:49,485 --> 00:02:50,685
(feedback from walkie-talkie) Hurry up

12
00:02:58,299 --> 00:03:00,767
ok, don't worry

13
00:03:21,958 --> 00:03:22,958
Where is the wax?

14
00:03:24,369 --> 00:03:25,403
There it is

15
00:03:26,503 --> 00:03:27,503
Yes.

16
00:03:48,494 --> 00:03:50,095
What was that? What is that?

17
00:03:50,707 --> 00:03:51,736
Heavens.

18
00:04:10,804 --> 00:04:12,066
alright

19
00:04:12,266 --> 00:04:14,179
sh-sh-she's all ready, captain

20
00:04:16,562 --> 00:04:17,562
she?

21
00:04:17,843 --> 00:04:20,411
you always call a b-boat, she

22
00:04:21,721 --> 00:04:22,721
she?

23
00:04:23,176 --> 00:04:24,276
Thanks, Billy.

24
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:35,028
See you later. Bye.

25
00:05:01,318 --> 00:05:03,018
Be careful.

26
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:53,053
No!

27
00:05:54,252 --> 00:05:55,252
No!

28
00:05:57,224 --> 00:05:58,623
Bill's gonna kill me

29
00:06:08,817 --> 00:06:10,816
Hiya Georgie

30
00:06:13,218 --> 00:06:14,617
what a nice boat

31
00:06:15,598 --> 00:06:16,718
do you want it back?

32
00:06:17,764 --> 00:06:19,162
Yes please.

33
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,673
You look like a nice boy. I bet you have a lot of friends.

34
00:06:24,112 --> 00:06:26,360
Three, but my brother is the bestest

35
00:06:27,002 --> 00:06:28,253
Where's he?

36
00:06:28,512 --> 00:06:30,576
Home, sick

37
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:34,279
I bet I could cheer him up. I'll give him a balloon.

38
00:06:36,978 --> 00:06:38,498
do you want a balloon too Georgie?

39
00:06:39,888 --> 00:06:42,902
I'm not supposed to take stuff from strangers

40
00:06:44,244 --> 00:06:47,643
oh well, I'm Pennywise the dancing clown

41
00:06:49,165 --> 00:06:53,048
Pennywise yes meet Georgie

42
00:06:53,248 --> 00:06:55,414
Georgie meet Pennywise

43
00:06:57,578 --> 00:07:00,187
Now we are not strangers, are we?

44
00:07:20,297 --> 00:07:22,194
what are you doing in the sewer?

45
00:07:22,395 --> 00:07:24,767
A storm blew me away

46
00:07:25,556 --> 00:07:28,355
Blew the whole circus away

47
00:07:30,991 --> 00:07:33,598
Can you smell the circus, Georgie?

48
00:07:35,055 --> 00:07:38,833
There are peanuts, cotton candy ...

49
00:07:39,427 --> 00:07:40,926
hot dogs ...

50
00:07:41,201 --> 00:07:42,815
annnnnnd

51
00:07:43,878 --> 00:07:44,927
Popcorn?

52
00:07:45,127 --> 00:07:47,226
Popcorn! Is that your favorite?

53
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:50,140
Uh huh. Mine too!

54
00:07:51,249 --> 00:07:54,111
Because they pop. Pop, pop, pop.

55
00:07:55,618 --> 00:07:56,654
Pop, pop, pop

56
00:07:56,886 --> 00:07:57,886
Pop!

57
00:08:08,177 --> 00:08:10,188
I should get going now.

58
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:13,577
Without your boat?

59
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:16,582
You don't want to lose it Georgie

60
00:08:16,982 --> 00:08:18,881
Bill's gonna kill you

61
00:08:22,391 --> 00:08:23,908
Here

62
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:26,253
Take it.

63
00:08:29,942 --> 00:08:32,041
Take it, Georgie

64
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:54,566
Help!

65
00:09:03,742 --> 00:09:04,828
Billy!

66
00:10:08,286 --> 00:10:09,286
Pull it, Mike.

67
00:10:12,761 --> 00:10:14,413
Go on now, pull it

68
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:26,558
Here, reload it

69
00:10:26,758 --> 00:10:29,617
You need to start takin' more responsibility around here, Mike

70
00:10:29,817 --> 00:10:31,340
Your dad was younger than you when ...

71
00:10:31,539 --> 00:10:33,741
I'm not my dad, okay?

72
00:10:34,471 --> 00:10:35,477
Yeah

73
00:10:37,422 --> 00:10:39,021
Look at me, son.

74
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:41,041
Look at me!

75
00:10:43,466 --> 00:10:46,166
There are two places you can be in this world.

76
00:10:46,366 --> 00:10:49,189
You can be here like us or you can be there ...

77
00:10:49,669 --> 00:10:51,172
like them.

78
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,196
If you waste your time hemming and hawing

79
00:10:53,396 --> 00:10:56,693
somebody else will make that choice for you

80
00:10:57,722 --> 00:11:01,530
Except that you will not know until you feel that bolt between your eyes.

81
00:11:11,335 --> 00:11:12,914
There is a church full of Jews.

82
00:11:13,113 --> 00:11:15,196
And Stan has to take the super Jew-y test

83
00:11:15,396 --> 00:11:16,858
But how does it work?

84
00:11:17,277 --> 00:11:18,745
They slice the tip of his dick off

85
00:11:18,947 --> 00:11:20,351
But then you'll have nothing left!

86
00:11:20,551 --> 00:11:22,192
- It is true. - Wait, you guys!

87
00:11:22,391 --> 00:11:24,870
Hey, Stan, what happens at the bar mitzvah anyways?

88
00:11:25,069 --> 00:11:28,426
Ed says you slice the tip of the d-d-d-dick off

89
00:11:28,627 --> 00:11:30,828
Yes, Rabbi's gonna pull down your pants

90
00:11:31,026 --> 00:11:33,125
and he will tell the crowd: "Where's the beef?".

91
00:11:33,825 --> 00:11:36,315
At he bar mitzvah, I read from the Torah ...

92
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:38,787
and then I make a speech, and suddenly I become a man

93
00:11:38,987 --> 00:11:40,634
There's more funner ways to become a man.

94
00:11:40,834 --> 00:11:42,088
"More fun ways", you mean.

95
00:11:42,112 --> 00:11:43,127
Fuck.

96
00:11:49,225 --> 00:11:51,341
Do you think they'll sign my yearbook?

97
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:52,540
"Dear Richie ...

98
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:55,341
sorry for taking a hot, steaming dump in your backpack last month

99
00:11:55,941 --> 00:11:57,277
"Have a good summer".

100
00:12:07,784 --> 00:12:09,383
Are you in there by yourself, Beaver-ly

101
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:12,041
Or do you have half the guys in the school with you, huh slut?

102
00:12:13,043 --> 00:12:15,643
I know you're in there, you little shit, I can smell you.

103
00:12:15,865 --> 00:12:17,597
No wonder you don't have any friends.

104
00:12:17,798 --> 00:12:21,707
Which is it, Greta? Am I a slut or a little shit

105
00:12:22,176 --> 00:12:23,375
Make up your mind

106
00:12:23,575 --> 00:12:24,580
You're trash.

107
00:12:27,338 --> 00:12:28,458
We just wanted to remind you.

108
00:12:28,638 --> 00:12:29,638
Such a loser.

109
00:12:33,323 --> 00:12:35,322
At least now you'll smell better.

110
00:12:35,557 --> 00:12:36,559
Gross.

111
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,699
Let's go girls.

112
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:40,623
Have a nice summer, Beaver-ly

113
00:12:40,823 --> 00:12:41,823
Pathetic.

114
00:12:51,073 --> 00:12:52,235
The best feeling ever

115
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:53,170
Yes?

116
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:54,986
Try tickling your pickle for the first time

117
00:12:55,497 --> 00:12:56,537
What do you guys wanna do tomorrow?

118
00:12:56,631 --> 00:12:57,843
I start my training.

119
00:12:58,043 --> 00:12:59,642
- What training? - Street Fighter.

120
00:12:59,874 --> 00:13:02,373
Is that how you want to spend your summer, stuck in an arcade

121
00:13:02,815 --> 00:13:04,187
Better than inside your mother.

122
00:13:05,089 --> 00:13:06,188
What if we go the the quarry?

123
00:13:07,045 --> 00:13:09,823
Guys, we can g-go to the barrens

124
00:13:11,173 --> 00:13:12,173
Right

125
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:14,434
Betty Ripsom's mom

126
00:13:16,152 --> 00:13:18,307
Does she really expect to see her coming out of the school?

127
00:13:19,506 --> 00:13:20,506
I don't know

128
00:13:20,705 --> 00:13:22,865
As if Betty Ripsom's been hiding in HomeEc for the last few weeks

129
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:24,381
Do you think they'll actually find her?

130
00:13:24,581 --> 00:13:25,581
Sure

131
00:13:25,811 --> 00:13:28,011
In a ditch. All decomposed, covered in worms and maggots, smelling ...

132
00:13:28,282 --> 00:13:29,470
like Eddie's mom's underwear.

133
00:13:29,494 --> 00:13:30,894
Shut up! Gross.

134
00:13:31,094 --> 00:13:34,016
She's not dead. She m-m-m-missing.

135
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:36,060
Sorry Bill, she's missing

136
00:13:38,923 --> 00:13:40,651
You know the barrens aren't that bad

137
00:13:40,851 --> 00:13:43,513
Who doesn't love splashing around in shitty water

138
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:48,766
Nice frisbee, flamer

139
00:13:48,965 --> 00:13:49,965
Give it back

140
00:13:50,935 --> 00:13:51,935
Fuckin' losers

141
00:13:56,192 --> 00:13:57,192
Loser.

142
00:13:57,572 --> 00:14:00,208
You s-s-s-suck, Bowers

143
00:14:00,508 --> 00:14:01,588
Shut up, Bill.

144
00:14:06,891 --> 00:14:10,740
Did you s-s-s-say something, B-b-b-b-Billy

145
00:14:11,494 --> 00:14:14,192
You got a free ride this year cuz of your little brother

146
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:17,000
Ride's over, Denbrough.

147
00:14:24,568 --> 00:14:27,267
This summer will be a hurt-train, for you and your faggot friends.

148
00:14:40,464 --> 00:14:42,161
I wish he'd go missing.

149
00:14:42,361 --> 00:14:43,861
He's probably the one doing it.

150
00:14:55,857 --> 00:14:56,557
Will you let me go by?

151
00:14:56,757 --> 00:14:58,401
or is there a secret password or something?

152
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:02,075
- Sorry. - Sorry is not ...

153
00:15:05,085 --> 00:15:06,195
password.

154
00:15:14,233 --> 00:15:17,070
Henry and his goons are over by the west entrance.

155
00:15:17,269 --> 00:15:18,387
So you should be fine.

156
00:15:18,588 --> 00:15:19,686
I wasn't...

157
00:15:19,885 --> 00:15:21,709
Everyone knows he's looking for you.

158
00:15:23,706 --> 00:15:25,327
Whatchu listening to?

159
00:15:31,571 --> 00:15:32,795
New Kids on the Block.

160
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:34,321
I don't even like them, I was just

161
00:15:34,527 --> 00:15:37,785
Wait. You're the new kid, right? Now I get it.

162
00:15:38,244 --> 00:15:39,544
There's nothing to get.

163
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:41,718
I'm just messing with you

164
00:15:43,313 --> 00:15:44,331
I'm Beverly Marsh.

165
00:15:44,531 --> 00:15:47,860
Yes. I know that because we're in the same class.

166
00:15:48,086 --> 00:15:50,209
Social Studies. And you were ...

167
00:15:51,267 --> 00:15:54,764
I'm Ben. But almost everyone calls me ...

168
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:56,330
The new kid.

169
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:59,670
Well, Ben, there are worse things to be called

170
00:16:00,199 --> 00:16:01,598
Let me sign this.

171
00:16:22,718 --> 00:16:24,887
Stay cool, Ben from Soc class

172
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:26,387
Yeah

173
00:16:27,039 --> 00:16:28,395
You too, Beverly.

174
00:16:28,595 --> 00:16:30,594
Hang tough, new kid on the block.

175
00:16:33,972 --> 00:16:35,326
"Please don't go girl"

176
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:40,583
That's the name of another New Kids on the Block song

177
00:16:50,842 --> 00:16:52,442
He thrusts his fists  against the post

178
00:16:54,506 --> 00:16:57,033
He thrusts his fists against the...

179
00:17:00,823 --> 00:17:01,823
shit. p-p-post

180
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:14,781
Need some help?

181
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,647
I thought we agreed.

182
00:17:22,148 --> 00:17:23,648
- Before you say anything ... - Bill.

183
00:17:23,848 --> 00:17:26,277
Let me show you something first.

184
00:17:43,532 --> 00:17:44,741
The barrens

185
00:17:45,893 --> 00:17:48,654
It is the only place where Georgie could have ended

186
00:17:48,853 --> 00:17:50,201
He's gone, Bill

187
00:17:52,255 --> 00:17:55,157
But if the storm swept Georgie in, we should have gone ...

188
00:17:55,383 --> 00:17:58,383
HE'S GONE, HE'S DEAD!

189
00:17:59,455 --> 00:18:03,252
He's dead! There is nothing we can do! Nothing!

190
00:18:06,741 --> 00:18:09,848
Now take this down before your mother sees it.

191
00:18:16,075 --> 00:18:18,573
Next time you want to take something from my office

192
00:18:20,607 --> 00:18:21,706
ask

193
00:18:27,175 --> 00:18:29,222
I guess you get your tunnels back.

194
00:18:59,188 --> 00:19:00,188
Come in.

195
00:19:10,579 --> 00:19:11,579
Oh, Jesus.

196
00:19:42,705 --> 00:19:43,740
Mike

197
00:19:48,566 --> 00:19:49,595
Hurry up, son!

198
00:19:49,743 --> 00:19:51,479
Help! I'm burning!

199
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:55,208
Mike

200
00:20:24,897 --> 00:20:26,796
Stay the fuck out of my town!

201
00:20:34,368 --> 00:20:35,368
Mike?

202
00:20:35,543 --> 00:20:36,549
Are you okay, son?

203
00:20:54,943 --> 00:20:56,787
You're not studying, Stanley.

204
00:20:58,131 --> 00:20:59,629
How's it gonna look,

205
00:20:59,828 --> 00:21:03,051
the rabbi's son can't finish his own Torah reading.

206
00:21:04,074 --> 00:21:05,574
Take the book to my office,

207
00:21:05,724 --> 00:21:07,582
Obviously you're not using it.

208
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:05,070
Take everything but the delicious deals, guys.

209
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:06,270
My mom loves them.

210
00:23:06,469 --> 00:23:10,169
Hey, first you said the barrens and now you're saying the sewer

211
00:23:10,496 --> 00:23:12,974
I mean, if we get caught?

212
00:23:13,174 --> 00:23:15,674
We won't, Eds. The sewers are public works.

213
00:23:15,824 --> 00:23:17,122
We are the public, aren't we?

214
00:23:17,629 --> 00:23:19,967
Eddie, are these your birth control pills?

215
00:23:20,744 --> 00:23:23,748
Yes, I'm saving it for your sister. This is private stuff.

216
00:23:24,001 --> 00:23:27,655
Hello, welcome to The Children's Hour Derry.

217
00:23:28,331 --> 00:23:31,948
Eddie, dear, where you boys off to in such a rush?

218
00:23:32,163 --> 00:23:34,770
Our word of the day is "clown". They know what it means!

219
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:38,154
Uhm, just m-m-my backyard, Mrs. K

220
00:23:38,523 --> 00:23:40,256
I got a new...

221
00:23:41,848 --> 00:23:46,577
A new croquet set. Jeez spit it out blubber Bill

222
00:23:46,777 --> 00:23:47,777
Okay

223
00:23:48,583 --> 00:23:50,882
Oh and sweetie, don't go rolling around in the grass

224
00:23:51,082 --> 00:23:52,780
especially if it's just been cut

225
00:23:53,563 --> 00:23:55,463
you know how bad your allergies can get.

226
00:23:55,664 --> 00:23:57,077
Yes mom. Come on.

227
00:23:57,277 --> 00:23:58,376
Aren't you forgetting something?

228
00:23:58,576 --> 00:24:01,573
Water surrounds us. Even it is upon us.

229
00:24:06,155 --> 00:24:07,455
They do not believe me?

230
00:24:07,769 --> 00:24:09,069
Try it at home.

231
00:24:09,993 --> 00:24:11,154
When outside ...

232
00:24:12,217 --> 00:24:13,427
Do you want one from me too, Mrs. K?

233
00:24:13,627 --> 00:24:15,128
No.

234
00:24:16,664 --> 00:24:17,863
Sorry mom.

235
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:42,598
"Your hair is winter fire, January embers ...

236
00:24:43,397 --> 00:24:44,730
"My heart burns there too."

237
00:24:44,754 --> 00:24:45,764
Slower!

238
00:24:45,964 --> 00:24:47,764
Hi-yo Silver awaaay!

239
00:24:48,064 --> 00:24:49,064
Let's move on!

240
00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:51,270
Your old lady bike's too fast for us.

241
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,298
I found it.

242
00:24:53,499 --> 00:24:55,247
Isn't it summer vacation?

243
00:24:55,447 --> 00:24:58,297
I'd think you'd be ready to take a break from the books.

244
00:24:58,496 --> 00:24:59,595
I like it in here.

245
00:25:00,562 --> 00:25:03,399
A boy should be spending his summer outside with his friends.

246
00:25:04,726 --> 00:25:05,955
Don't you have any friends?

247
00:25:06,948 --> 00:25:08,547
Can I have the book now?

248
00:28:10,672 --> 00:28:12,082
Egg boy!

249
00:28:15,902 --> 00:28:17,021
What on Earth are you doing?

250
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:39,310
Where you off to, Tits?

251
00:28:42,535 --> 00:28:43,535
Got ya!

252
00:28:43,958 --> 00:28:45,011
Wait.

253
00:28:45,683 --> 00:28:46,983
- Hold him. - Leave me alone!

254
00:28:47,183 --> 00:28:48,423
- Hit him. -you will not escape.

255
00:28:48,581 --> 00:28:49,581
Help!

256
00:28:50,301 --> 00:28:51,301
Hold him!

257
00:28:52,647 --> 00:28:55,043
-Hold him, Hockstetter. -Grab him, Belch.

258
00:28:58,362 --> 00:29:00,964
- Leave me alone. - Look all that blubber.

259
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:05,105
I'm gonna light his hair like Michael Jackson

260
00:29:05,805 --> 00:29:06,805
Hold him

261
00:29:07,005 --> 00:29:09,004
Get off me, get off me

262
00:29:17,605 --> 00:29:18,605
Help!

263
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:21,467
Help!

264
00:29:26,541 --> 00:29:27,641
Okay, new kid.

265
00:29:28,164 --> 00:29:29,723
This is why us locals call this the kissing bridge

266
00:29:30,521 --> 00:29:33,021
It's for two things: sucking face

267
00:29:34,779 --> 00:29:35,951
and cutting names.

268
00:29:36,153 --> 00:29:37,452
Henry, please.

269
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:45,093
Stop! Henry!

270
00:29:45,293 --> 00:29:46,393
Shut up!

271
00:29:47,151 --> 00:29:49,648
I'm gonna carve my whole name into his cottage cheese

272
00:29:54,349 --> 00:29:56,549
I'm gonna cut your fucking tits off. I swear to god!

273
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:57,880
Get him!

274
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,400
Come on!

275
00:30:03,044 --> 00:30:04,044
Get him!

276
00:30:04,561 --> 00:30:05,561
You can't run!

277
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:08,668
- No. - We must find the fatso.

278
00:30:15,718 --> 00:30:18,315
My knife. My old man will kill me!

279
00:30:21,714 --> 00:30:23,594
-. You two, get him! - Come on!

280
00:30:25,957 --> 00:30:27,385
Move your fucking ass!

281
00:30:28,884 --> 00:30:31,322
Go that way

282
00:30:33,805 --> 00:30:35,073
He's down there.

283
00:31:07,521 --> 00:31:09,146
I don't know. I guess.

284
00:31:11,215 --> 00:31:15,213
That's poison ivy. And that's poison ivy.

285
00:31:15,413 --> 00:31:16,567
And that's poison ivy.

286
00:31:16,767 --> 00:31:18,465
Where? Where's the poison ivy?

287
00:31:18,665 --> 00:31:22,504
No where, not every fucking plant is poison ivy, Stanley.

288
00:31:22,904 --> 00:31:26,105
Ok well I'm starting to get itchy now and I'm pretty sure this is not good for me

289
00:31:26,305 --> 00:31:28,943
Do you use the same bathroom as your mother?

290
00:31:29,094 --> 00:31:30,200
Sometimes, yeah.

291
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:31,900
Then you probably have crabs.

292
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,100
That's not funny.

293
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,381
Aren't you guys coming in?

294
00:31:40,356 --> 00:31:42,168
Uhuh that's gray water.

295
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:43,516
What the hell is gray water?

296
00:31:43,517 --> 00:31:46,329
It's basically piss and shit. So I'm just telling you...

297
00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:51,004
You guys are splashing around in millions of gallons of Derry pee.

298
00:31:51,105 --> 00:31:52,207
Are, are you serious?

299
00:31:52,308 --> 00:31:54,440
Doesn't smell like caca to me, Senor

300
00:31:54,641 --> 00:31:56,481
O-o-okay I can smell it from here.

301
00:31:56,582 --> 00:31:58,810
It's probably just your breath wafting back into your face

302
00:31:59,911 --> 00:32:01,412
Have you ever heard of a staph infection?

303
00:32:01,513 --> 00:32:02,744
I'll show you a "staff" infection.

304
00:32:02,944 --> 00:32:04,541
That's so unsanitary. These...

305
00:32:04,641 --> 00:32:06,806
you guys are like swimming in a toilet bowl right now

306
00:32:06,907 --> 00:32:08,295
Have you ever heard of listeria?

307
00:32:10,254 --> 00:32:11,273
Are you retarded?

308
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:13,194
You're the reason we're in this situation

309
00:32:13,296 --> 00:32:14,594
Guys!

310
00:32:16,858 --> 00:32:18,892
Shit. Don't tell me that's ...

311
00:32:19,502 --> 00:32:20,590
No.

312
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:23,050
Georgie was wearing galoshes.

313
00:32:24,774 --> 00:32:25,928
Who's sneaker is it?

314
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:30,068
It's Betty Ripsoms.

315
00:32:30,468 --> 00:32:31,767
Shit!

316
00:32:31,891 --> 00:32:33,293
Shit, oh god, oh fuck

317
00:32:33,328 --> 00:32:34,482
I don't like this

318
00:32:34,683 --> 00:32:36,452
How do you think Betty feels,

319
00:32:37,053 --> 00:32:39,729
going around these tunnels with only one fucking shoe.

320
00:32:43,918 --> 00:32:45,415
What if she's still here?

321
00:32:50,667 --> 00:32:52,061
Eddie, come on!

322
00:32:52,162 --> 00:32:54,970
My mom will have an aneurysm if she finds out we were playing down here.

323
00:32:55,172 --> 00:32:56,172
I'm serious.

324
00:32:57,702 --> 00:32:58,705
Bill?

325
00:33:01,991 --> 00:33:04,117
If I were Betty Ripsom, I would want us to find me.

326
00:33:06,546 --> 00:33:08,052
Georgie too.

327
00:33:09,546 --> 00:33:10,946
What if I don't want to find them?

328
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:16,526
I mean, no offense, Bill, but I do not want to end up like ...

329
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:21,131
I don't want to go missing either

330
00:33:21,831 --> 00:33:24,195
- You're right. - You too?

331
00:33:24,395 --> 00:33:25,794
It's summer,

332
00:33:25,896 --> 00:33:27,176
we're supposed to be having fun.

333
00:33:28,446 --> 00:33:30,011
This isn't funny.

334
00:33:30,652 --> 00:33:31,817
This is scary and disgusting

335
00:33:38,651 --> 00:33:40,618
Holy shit, what happened to you?

336
00:34:23,388 --> 00:34:25,493
I hear you, tits.

337
00:34:42,012 --> 00:34:45,280
Don't think you can stay down here all damn day

338
00:34:58,734 --> 00:35:01,173
(whispering) You found us, Patrick.

339
00:35:01,274 --> 00:35:04,256
You found us, Patrick

340
00:35:07,189 --> 00:35:08,189
Patrick.

341
00:35:24,118 --> 00:35:25,118
Shit.

342
00:35:56,705 --> 00:35:58,297
I think it's great that we're helping the new kid

343
00:35:58,321 --> 00:35:59,792
but we also need to think about our own safety.

344
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:01,578
I mean, he's bleeding all over

345
00:36:01,779 --> 00:36:03,950
and you guys know there's an AIDS epidemic happening right now as we speak

346
00:36:04,051 --> 00:36:07,527
I mean my mom's friend in New York City got it just by touching a dirty pole in the subway

347
00:36:07,628 --> 00:36:10,924
and she got AIDS blood into her system through a hangnail, a hangnail!

348
00:36:11,026 --> 00:36:13,708
And they can amputate legs and arms.

349
00:36:13,909 --> 00:36:16,667
But how do you amputate waist?

350
00:36:16,867 --> 00:36:19,232
You know that there are alleys full of AIDS infected needles, right?

351
00:36:19,256 --> 00:36:20,256
You. Know that.

352
00:36:21,167 --> 00:36:22,167
We're dead.

353
00:36:23,021 --> 00:36:24,101
Richie, wait here. Come on.

354
00:36:28,604 --> 00:36:30,466
Glad I got to meet you before you died.

355
00:36:38,451 --> 00:36:39,780
Good.

356
00:36:41,701 --> 00:36:43,039
Can we afford that?

357
00:36:43,139 --> 00:36:44,140
It's all we got.

358
00:36:44,241 --> 00:36:45,539
You kidding me?

359
00:36:47,925 --> 00:36:50,153
Wait, you have an account here don't you?

360
00:36:50,654 --> 00:36:52,815
If my mom finds out I bought all this stuff for myself

361
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:56,374
I'll spend the whole rest of the week in the emergency room.

362
00:37:10,335 --> 00:37:11,463
See you later, dad.

363
00:37:11,565 --> 00:37:13,563
See ya, Greta.

364
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:20,584
You okay?

365
00:37:22,223 --> 00:37:24,029
I'm fine, what's wrong with you?

366
00:37:24,629 --> 00:37:25,684
None of your business.

367
00:37:25,786 --> 00:37:28,190
New kid outside looks like someone killed him.

368
00:37:29,090 --> 00:37:32,343
We need some s-s-s-supplies

369
00:37:32,446 --> 00:37:35,209
but we don't have enough money.

370
00:37:40,536 --> 00:37:42,231
I like your glasses, Mr. Keene

371
00:37:42,831 --> 00:37:45,061
You look just like Clark Kent.

372
00:37:46,866 --> 00:37:48,449
I don't know about that.

373
00:37:48,549 --> 00:37:49,757
Can I try them on?

374
00:37:52,596 --> 00:37:53,596
Sure.

375
00:37:59,666 --> 00:38:01,335
What do you think?

376
00:38:02,375 --> 00:38:04,596
Well how about that,

377
00:38:04,897 --> 00:38:07,151
you look just like Lois Lane.

378
00:38:09,461 --> 00:38:10,461
Really?

379
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:16,577
Well, here you go.

380
00:38:18,198 --> 00:38:19,343
Shoot, I'm so sorry. It's okay.

381
00:38:34,289 --> 00:38:35,514
Just suck the wound.

382
00:38:35,815 --> 00:38:37,725
I need to focus right now. You need to focus?

383
00:38:37,825 --> 00:38:38,870
Yeah, can you go get me something?

384
00:38:38,971 --> 00:38:41,174
Jesus. Oh, what do you need?

385
00:38:41,210 --> 00:38:42,367
Go get my bifocals, they're in my second fanny pack.

386
00:38:42,569 --> 00:38:44,205
Why do you have two fanny pack?

387
00:38:44,406 --> 00:38:45,851
I need to focus right now, it's a long story.

388
00:38:45,875 --> 00:38:46,977
I don't want to hear it.

389
00:39:00,024 --> 00:39:01,024
uhmm, th-th-thanks.

390
00:39:01,551 --> 00:39:02,695
Even Steven.

391
00:39:02,796 --> 00:39:05,147
Oh god, he's bleeding.

392
00:39:05,348 --> 00:39:06,480
Oh my god, Ben from Soc?

393
00:39:06,582 --> 00:39:09,134
You have to suck the wound before you apply the bandage.

394
00:39:09,186 --> 00:39:11,129
- It's basic. - What are you talking about?

395
00:39:11,228 --> 00:39:13,247
Are you okay, that looks like it hurts.

396
00:39:13,846 --> 00:39:15,377
No, I'm good. I just fell.

397
00:39:15,478 --> 00:39:16,876
Yeah, right into Henry Bowers.

398
00:39:17,079 --> 00:39:18,618
Shut it, R-R-Richie!

399
00:39:18,718 --> 00:39:20,357
Why? It's the truth.

400
00:39:21,594 --> 00:39:25,056
You sure they got "The Right Stuff" to fix you up?

401
00:39:28,408 --> 00:39:30,988
You know w-w-w-w-we'll take care of him.

402
00:39:31,188 --> 00:39:32,547
Thanks again, Beverly.

403
00:39:32,648 --> 00:39:35,653
Sure, maybe I'll see you around.

404
00:39:35,754 --> 00:39:39,525
Yeah, we were maybe thinking about going to the q-q-q-quarry tomorrow,

405
00:39:39,846 --> 00:39:41,545
if you wanna

406
00:39:42,148 --> 00:39:43,148
come?

407
00:39:43,723 --> 00:39:46,001
Good to Know. Thanks.

408
00:39:49,718 --> 00:39:51,558
Nice going, bringing up Bowers in front of her.

409
00:39:51,759 --> 00:39:52,852
Yeah, did you hear what she did?

410
00:39:54,022 --> 00:39:55,129
What'd she do?

411
00:39:55,228 --> 00:39:56,627
Well, from what

412
00:39:56,729 --> 00:39:58,631
I heard that the list is longer than my wang.

413
00:39:59,031 --> 00:40:00,544
That's not saying much.

414
00:40:00,645 --> 00:40:03,165
They're j-j-just rumors.

415
00:40:03,768 --> 00:40:05,482
Anyway, Bill had her back in third grade.

416
00:40:06,764 --> 00:40:08,044
They kissed in the school play.

417
00:40:08,105 --> 00:40:10,655
The reviews said that you can't fake that kind of passion.

418
00:40:10,756 --> 00:40:13,112
Now, pip pip and tally-ho my good fellows,

419
00:40:13,714 --> 00:40:15,721
I do believe this chap requires our utmost attention.

420
00:40:15,822 --> 00:40:17,372
Now get in there Dr. K and fix him up!

421
00:40:17,573 --> 00:40:19,611
Why don't you shut the fuck up, Einstein, because I know what I'm doing

422
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:21,232
and I don't want you doing the British guy.

423
00:40:21,450 --> 00:40:22,901
Suck the wound. Get in there.

424
00:40:23,002 --> 00:40:27,325
toilet and tub water travels down drains into sewers.

425
00:40:27,427 --> 00:40:30,982
Culverts are fun to play with all your friends.

426
00:40:31,083 --> 00:40:35,686
Just keep the water into drains and sewers reach.

427
00:40:35,787 --> 00:40:40,583
When you are there with friends, you can have fun like a clown!

428
00:40:40,685 --> 00:40:42,916
That's right, it is the word of the day.

429
00:40:46,441 --> 00:40:47,441
Hi daddy.

430
00:40:47,707 --> 00:40:48,954
Hey Bevvie

431
00:40:49,453 --> 00:40:50,654
What you got there?

432
00:40:53,092 --> 00:40:54,302
Just some things.

433
00:40:54,844 --> 00:40:56,165
Like what?

434
00:41:17,784 --> 00:41:20,076
Tell me you're still my little girl.

435
00:41:20,676 --> 00:41:21,945
Yes daddy.

436
00:41:24,787 --> 00:41:26,067
Good.

437
00:41:26,368 --> 00:41:28,898
A high ball to the left. His last batting.

438
00:41:29,099 --> 00:41:30,573
He brushed the post.

439
00:41:31,273 --> 00:41:34,414
Wade Booggs, of course, leads the league in such long shots.

440
00:41:49,007 --> 00:41:52,681
This is what you did. This is what...

441
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:28,903
Do it!

442
00:42:34,753 --> 00:42:35,802
Oh my god!

443
00:42:36,502 --> 00:42:38,017
- Piece of cake. - Poor tree.

444
00:42:38,117 --> 00:42:39,415
So easy!

445
00:42:40,242 --> 00:42:42,112
Oh my god, that was terrible. I win.

446
00:42:42,213 --> 00:42:43,313
You won? Yeah

447
00:42:43,414 --> 00:42:45,565
You see my loogie, it went the farthest.

448
00:42:45,765 --> 00:42:47,351
It's about distance. It's mass.

449
00:42:47,375 --> 00:42:48,653
What is mass?

450
00:42:48,854 --> 00:42:50,235
It doesn't matter how far it goes.

451
00:42:50,436 --> 00:42:53,212
It's how cool it looks, and it's green or it's white.

452
00:42:53,714 --> 00:42:54,649
Alright.

453
00:42:54,687 --> 00:42:56,007
Who's first?

454
00:43:00,302 --> 00:43:01,415
I'll go.

455
00:43:05,856 --> 00:43:06,856
Sissies!

456
00:43:10,247 --> 00:43:12,040
What the fuck?

457
00:43:16,454 --> 00:43:18,725
Ahhh, holy shit, we just got shown off by a girl.

458
00:43:18,925 --> 00:43:20,329
We have to do that now?

459
00:43:20,430 --> 00:43:21,430
Yes.

460
00:43:21,648 --> 00:43:22,648
Come on!

461
00:43:23,543 --> 00:43:24,906
Oh shit!

462
00:43:35,006 --> 00:43:36,970
I already won! Already we won!

463
00:43:39,147 --> 00:43:40,673
They fell! Yes!

464
00:44:08,235 --> 00:44:09,294
Oh,shit! W-w-w-wait, wait, wait.

465
00:44:09,429 --> 00:44:10,909
- Ah fuck! What was that? - It just touched my foot.

466
00:44:14,266 --> 00:44:14,966
Does that work?

467
00:44:15,067 --> 00:44:16,809
- Where? - Here.

468
00:44:17,009 --> 00:44:18,070
It's a turtle.

469
00:44:51,292 --> 00:44:53,441
News flash, Ben, School's out for summa

470
00:44:53,641 --> 00:44:54,712
Oh that, that's not school stuff.

471
00:44:56,218 --> 00:44:57,832
- Who sent you this? - No one.

472
00:44:58,233 --> 00:44:59,331
No one.

473
00:45:03,327 --> 00:45:04,525
What's with the history project?

474
00:45:05,672 --> 00:45:09,481
Oh well, when I first moved here, I really didn't have anyone to hang out with

475
00:45:09,482 --> 00:45:11,615
so I just started spending time in the library.

476
00:45:12,723 --> 00:45:13,835
You went to the library?

477
00:45:14,936 --> 00:45:16,227
On purpose?

478
00:45:16,343 --> 00:45:17,741
I wanna see.

479
00:45:20,844 --> 00:45:22,102
What's the Black Spot?

480
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:23,851
The Black Spot was a nightclub that was burned down years ago by

481
00:45:24,051 --> 00:45:25,151
that racist cult.

482
00:45:25,899 --> 00:45:26,899
The what?

483
00:45:27,015 --> 00:45:28,028
Don't you watch Geraldo?

484
00:45:29,883 --> 00:45:31,229
Y-y-y-y-your hair...

485
00:45:33,628 --> 00:45:35,326
Your hair looks beautiful. Beverly.

486
00:45:37,723 --> 00:45:39,491
Oh, hey thanks.

487
00:45:42,881 --> 00:45:44,819
Here, pass.

488
00:45:49,325 --> 00:45:50,845
Why's it all murders and missing kids?

489
00:45:51,527 --> 00:45:53,799
Derry's not like any town I've ever been in before

490
00:45:54,845 --> 00:45:57,639
They did a study once ...

491
00:45:58,564 --> 00:46:01,893
it turns out people die or disappear six times the national average.

492
00:46:04,025 --> 00:46:05,429
You read that?

493
00:46:06,027 --> 00:46:07,752
Not just grown-ups

494
00:46:07,897 --> 00:46:09,532
Kids are like worse

495
00:46:10,032 --> 00:46:11,229
way, way worse.

496
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:15,807
I've got more stuff, if you want to see it.

497
00:46:46,282 --> 00:46:47,866
Do not freak out, just tell us.

498
00:46:48,167 --> 00:46:50,593
Yes. I heard he has a roller coaster and a chimpanzee ...

499
00:46:50,695 --> 00:46:53,384
and the bones of an old man. Yes.

500
00:46:54,992 --> 00:46:56,191
Heavens.

501
00:46:56,492 --> 00:46:57,624
Woah, woah, woah, wow!

502
00:46:57,721 --> 00:46:58,756
Cool, huh?

503
00:46:59,501 --> 00:47:01,644
No, nothing cool.

504
00:47:01,844 --> 00:47:03,751
There's nothing cool.

505
00:47:05,465 --> 00:47:08,284
Well this is cool, wait, no it's not.

506
00:47:08,384 --> 00:47:09,938
What's that?

507
00:47:09,939 --> 00:47:12,781
That? That's the charter for Derry Township

508
00:47:12,981 --> 00:47:14,481
Nerd alert.

509
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:17,108
Actually, it's really interesting.

510
00:47:17,210 --> 00:47:18,770
Derry started as a beaver trapping camp.

511
00:47:18,871 --> 00:47:21,230
Still is, am I right, boys?

512
00:47:21,511 --> 00:47:24,128
Ninety-one people signed the charter that made Derry.

513
00:47:24,229 --> 00:47:28,124
But later that winter, they all disappeared without a trace.

514
00:47:28,252 --> 00:47:29,627
The entire camp?

515
00:47:29,981 --> 00:47:31,607
There were rumors of Indians...

516
00:47:31,708 --> 00:47:34,002
but no sign of an attack.

517
00:47:34,976 --> 00:47:37,824
Everyone thought it was a plague or something.

518
00:47:38,025 --> 00:47:39,324
But it's like ...

519
00:47:40,024 --> 00:47:42,899
one day everybody just woke up and left.

520
00:47:43,935 --> 00:47:48,259
The only clue was a trail of clothes leading to the well-house.

521
00:47:48,860 --> 00:47:50,931
Jesus, we can go on "Unsolved Mysteries"

522
00:47:51,031 --> 00:47:52,471
- Let's do it. You are brilliant. - Maybe.

523
00:48:01,584 --> 00:48:02,660
I don't know.

524
00:48:02,761 --> 00:48:05,229
Maybe he's  just trying to make friends, Stanley.

525
00:48:05,868 --> 00:48:07,333
Where was the well house?

526
00:48:08,378 --> 00:48:10,565
I don't know, somewhere in town, I guess.

527
00:48:10,966 --> 00:48:12,058
Why?

528
00:48:12,159 --> 00:48:13,459
Nothing.

529
00:48:16,057 --> 00:48:20,903
Nobody knows the trouble I've seen no one knows my pain

530
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:14,205
Eddie...

531
00:49:17,479 --> 00:49:19,941
What are you looking for?

532
00:49:24,729 --> 00:49:27,076
Fuck. My mom will kill me.

533
00:49:38,213 --> 00:49:40,661
Do you think this will help me, Eddie?

534
00:49:55,676 --> 00:49:58,323
Help!

535
00:50:18,381 --> 00:50:20,446
Where are you going, Eds?

536
00:50:21,047 --> 00:50:23,698
If you lived here, you'd be home right now.

537
00:50:25,962 --> 00:50:28,255
Come join the clown, Eds.

538
00:50:28,857 --> 00:50:30,282
You'll float down here.

539
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:32,636
We all float down here,

540
00:50:32,837 --> 00:50:34,137
yes we do.

541
00:51:29,351 --> 00:51:31,964
"Your hair is winter fire ...

542
00:51:32,765 --> 00:51:35,108
"January embers..."

543
00:51:35,907 --> 00:51:38,400
"My heart burns there too."

544
00:51:51,109 --> 00:51:52,439
Beverly...

545
00:51:56,417 --> 00:51:58,402
Beverly.

546
00:51:59,923 --> 00:52:00,923
Help me.

547
00:52:05,467 --> 00:52:06,843
Please help me.

548
00:52:10,788 --> 00:52:15,080
We all want to meet you, Beverly.

549
00:52:15,981 --> 00:52:19,634
All we float down here.

550
00:52:23,436 --> 00:52:26,611
Hello? Who you are?

551
00:52:26,813 --> 00:52:28,859
- I'm Veronica. - Betty Rapsom.

552
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:30,659
Patrick Hockstetter.

553
00:52:31,259 --> 00:52:32,281
Come closer.

554
00:52:32,382 --> 00:52:34,714
- You want to see? - We float.

555
00:52:34,815 --> 00:52:36,889
We changed.

556
00:53:46,854 --> 00:53:47,898
Daddy!

557
00:53:47,999 --> 00:53:49,297
Help!

558
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:50,876
Help!

559
00:54:26,779 --> 00:54:27,989
What the hell's goin' on?

560
00:54:31,606 --> 00:54:32,832
The sink...

561
00:54:36,260 --> 00:54:37,853
There's blood, it's...

562
00:54:38,251 --> 00:54:40,067
What blood?

563
00:54:41,509 --> 00:54:45,779
The sink, you don't see it?

564
00:54:47,189 --> 00:54:48,306
There was blood.

565
00:54:57,182 --> 00:54:58,746
You worry me, Bevvie.

566
00:55:00,116 --> 00:55:02,027
You worry me a lot.

567
00:55:02,128 --> 00:55:05,004
But you don't see?

568
00:55:05,206 --> 00:55:07,471
Why'd you do this to your hair?

569
00:55:08,783 --> 00:55:10,855
Makes you look like a boy.

570
00:58:23,121 --> 00:58:25,882
I lost it, Billy. Don't be mad.

571
00:58:28,805 --> 00:58:31,196
I'm not mad at you.

572
00:58:39,906 --> 00:58:41,899
Just floated off.

573
00:58:46,712 --> 00:58:49,347
But, Bill, if you come with me ...

574
00:58:49,549 --> 00:58:51,674
You'll float too.

575
00:58:51,875 --> 00:58:53,074
Georgie.

576
00:58:54,128 --> 00:58:56,046
You'll float too!

577
00:58:56,147 --> 00:58:58,046
You'll float too!

578
00:58:58,245 --> 00:59:00,077
You'll float too!

579
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:03,359
You'll float too!

580
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:04,768
You'll float too!

581
00:59:04,870 --> 00:59:08,712
You'll float too!

582
00:59:08,814 --> 00:59:10,126
You'll float too!

583
00:59:10,228 --> 00:59:11,892
You'll float too!

584
00:59:12,574 --> 00:59:14,200
You'll float too!

585
00:59:30,196 --> 00:59:30,950
We must not go down the alley.

586
00:59:31,086 --> 00:59:32,938
- It takes a lot down the alley. - No. is faster.

587
00:59:32,962 --> 00:59:34,242
It is more dangerous and unpleasant.

588
00:59:35,359 --> 00:59:38,553
- What do you mean it's more dangerous? - It smells of urine and is disgusting.

589
00:59:38,653 --> 00:59:39,606
All right. Can you tell me exactly what she said?

590
00:59:39,640 --> 00:59:42,232
Just you guys need to hurry over.

591
00:59:42,300 --> 00:59:43,300
- Good. - Good.

592
00:59:44,084 --> 00:59:45,879
You came.

593
00:59:46,078 --> 00:59:47,702
I-I need to show you something.

594
00:59:47,903 --> 00:59:49,204
What is it?

595
00:59:49,304 --> 00:59:50,464
More than we saw at the quarry?

596
00:59:50,488 --> 00:59:51,728
Shut up! Just shut up, Richie.

597
00:59:52,401 --> 00:59:56,000
My dad will kill me if he finds out that I had boys in the apartment.

598
00:59:56,790 --> 00:59:58,800
W-w-w-w-we'll leave a lookout.

599
00:59:58,824 --> 01:00:01,100
Now Richie, just stay here.

600
01:00:01,201 --> 01:00:03,405
Woah, woah, woah, what if her dad comes back?

601
01:00:04,217 --> 01:00:06,618
Do what you always do. Start talking.

602
01:00:08,651 --> 01:00:09,893
It is a gift.

603
01:00:19,125 --> 01:00:20,128
In there...

604
01:00:21,512 --> 01:00:23,098
What is it?

605
01:00:23,198 --> 01:00:24,500
You'll see.

606
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:26,468
Great, bringing us to the bathroom.

607
01:00:26,571 --> 01:00:28,822
You know that 89% of the worse accidents

608
01:00:29,020 --> 01:00:30,857
occur in the bathroom and kitchen

609
01:00:31,060 --> 01:00:33,894
And that's where all the bacteria and fungi are ...

610
01:00:33,995 --> 01:00:36,172
and it is not a hygienic place ...

611
01:00:39,672 --> 01:00:41,006
I knew it!

612
01:00:41,208 --> 01:00:42,317
Do you see it?

613
01:00:42,418 --> 01:00:43,418
Yes.

614
01:00:44,347 --> 01:00:45,671
What happened in here?

615
01:00:45,672 --> 01:00:49,447
My dad couldn't see it, I thought that I might be crazy.

616
01:00:50,372 --> 01:00:53,681
Well if you're crazy, then we're all crazy.

617
01:00:53,879 --> 01:00:56,999
We c-c-c-can't leave it like this.

618
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:13,277
You never went to the Summer Fair Derry?

619
01:02:13,362 --> 01:02:15,482
No, I think not.

620
01:02:16,568 --> 01:02:17,813
That I know.

621
01:02:19,614 --> 01:02:21,819
I go every year ...

622
01:02:22,019 --> 01:02:25,173
but once I went with Richie and I won because I hit the target.

623
01:02:25,375 --> 01:02:28,998
But there were so many prizes I didn't know which one to choose.

624
01:02:33,490 --> 01:02:35,695
It's not true, you know...

625
01:02:35,896 --> 01:02:37,155
What they say about me.

626
01:02:39,927 --> 01:02:42,211
I was only ever kissed by one guy.

627
01:02:45,131 --> 01:02:46,976
It was a long time ago.

628
01:02:47,997 --> 01:02:49,973
But it was a nice kiss though.

629
01:02:54,808 --> 01:02:56,567
"January embers"

630
01:03:00,306 --> 01:03:02,195
W-w-w-w-was that in the play?

631
01:03:04,192 --> 01:03:05,952
No, the poem.

632
01:03:07,612 --> 01:03:10,727
Oh, I really don't read much p-p-poetry.

633
01:03:14,017 --> 01:03:16,088
Oh I just,

634
01:03:18,210 --> 01:03:19,221
never mind.

635
01:03:25,311 --> 01:03:28,113
Oh, just so you know,

636
01:03:28,213 --> 01:03:30,397
I never believed any of the rumors.

637
01:03:31,516 --> 01:03:34,740
None of us losers do.

638
01:03:37,303 --> 01:03:38,459
We like hanging with you.

639
01:03:41,223 --> 01:03:42,447
Thanks.

640
01:03:42,548 --> 01:03:44,555
You should not thank us too much

641
01:03:44,755 --> 01:03:46,782
hanging out with us makes you a loser too.

642
01:03:48,473 --> 01:03:49,852
I can take that.

643
01:03:54,529 --> 01:03:56,530
No, I love being your personal doorman.

644
01:03:56,732 --> 01:03:58,278
Really could you idiots have taken any longer?

645
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:00,478
- Shut up, Richie. - Yeah, shut up, Richie.

646
01:04:00,578 --> 01:04:02,883
Oh okay, trash the trash-mouth, I get it.

647
01:04:03,186 --> 01:04:05,137
Hey I wasn't the one scrubbing the bathroom floor

648
01:04:05,238 --> 01:04:08,516
imagining that her sink went all Eddie's mom's vagina on halloween.

649
01:04:08,717 --> 01:04:10,610
She didn't imagine.

650
01:04:15,617 --> 01:04:17,696
I also saw something too.

651
01:04:18,896 --> 01:04:20,000
You saw blood, too?

652
01:04:21,886 --> 01:04:23,038
Not blood,

653
01:04:24,861 --> 01:04:28,869
I saw G-g-Georgie.

654
01:04:30,409 --> 01:04:32,459
It seemed so real,

655
01:04:32,661 --> 01:04:34,564
I mean it seemed like him but there was this...

656
01:04:35,535 --> 01:04:36,535
A clown.

657
01:04:41,669 --> 01:04:42,950
Yeah, I saw him too.

658
01:04:50,067 --> 01:04:52,635
Wait, can only virgins see this stuff?

659
01:04:52,736 --> 01:04:54,294
Is that why I'm not. seeing this shit?

660
01:04:57,482 --> 01:04:58,922
Oh shit, that's Belch Huggins car.

661
01:04:59,840 --> 01:05:01,600
We, we should probably get outta here. -yes

662
01:05:01,701 --> 01:05:04,097
Wait isn't that the home schooled kids bike?

663
01:05:04,298 --> 01:05:05,376
Yeah, that's Mikes.

664
01:05:07,463 --> 01:05:08,863
We have to help him.

665
01:05:08,965 --> 01:05:10,265
We should?

666
01:05:10,466 --> 01:05:11,566
Yes.

667
01:05:18,589 --> 01:05:20,131
Come on.

668
01:05:21,885 --> 01:05:22,672
Take that!

669
01:05:22,873 --> 01:05:24,502
- Take that, bitch! - Damn fool!

670
01:05:24,603 --> 01:05:26,284
- Bitch! - Motherfucker!

671
01:05:26,386 --> 01:05:27,616
- Take that bitch!

672
01:05:28,992 --> 01:05:29,992
Damned...

673
01:05:30,530 --> 01:05:31,438
What are you going to do?

674
01:05:31,439 --> 01:05:32,440
Get up!

675
01:05:35,746 --> 01:05:36,943
Raise that ass!

676
01:05:38,370 --> 01:05:39,370
Fucking idiot!

677
01:05:48,227 --> 01:05:49,393
Come on, Henry, do it harder!

678
01:05:49,495 --> 01:05:50,595
Times.

679
01:05:53,706 --> 01:05:55,910
-Nice throw. -Thanks.

680
01:06:02,053 --> 01:06:03,475
You losers are trying too hard.

681
01:06:04,357 --> 01:06:05,411
She'll do you,

682
01:06:05,612 --> 01:06:07,323
You just gotta ask nicely

683
01:06:08,145 --> 01:06:10,092
like I did.

684
01:06:16,243 --> 01:06:17,488
The fuck?

685
01:06:21,282 --> 01:06:22,499
Come on, get him!

686
01:06:22,700 --> 01:06:24,000
ROCK WAR!!!!

687
01:06:26,053 --> 01:06:27,917
- Give them hard! - Watch out!

688
01:06:28,409 --> 01:06:30,123
Drop dead, you fuckers.

689
01:06:33,652 --> 01:06:34,879
Eddie!

690
01:06:38,098 --> 01:06:39,098
Get out of here!

691
01:06:41,976 --> 01:06:42,976
Shit!

692
01:06:43,510 --> 01:06:45,610
(slowly) FUCK YOU BITCH!

693
01:06:49,784 --> 01:06:50,904
Come on guys!  Harder!

694
01:06:52,436 --> 01:06:53,947
Go to the hell, losers!

695
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:07,290
GO BLOW YOUR DAD, YOU MULLET-WEARING ASSHOLE!

696
01:07:16,513 --> 01:07:18,335
Thanks guys, but you shouldn't have done that,

697
01:07:18,437 --> 01:07:19,958
he'll be after you guys too now.

698
01:07:20,159 --> 01:07:23,716
Ah, now Bowers, he's always after us.

699
01:07:24,217 --> 01:07:28,319
I guess that's one th-th-thing we all have in common.

700
01:07:28,521 --> 01:07:31,716
Yes son, welcome to the loser's club.

701
01:07:35,938 --> 01:07:36,989
Here.

702
01:07:41,954 --> 01:07:44,144
They said they found part of his hand all chewed up near the standpipe.

703
01:07:45,864 --> 01:07:47,696
He asked to borrow a pencil once.

704
01:07:51,797 --> 01:07:54,178
It's like she's been f-f-f-forgotten

705
01:07:54,280 --> 01:07:56,659
because Corcoran's missing.

706
01:07:58,434 --> 01:07:59,485
Is it ever gonna end?

707
01:07:59,585 --> 01:08:00,884
What the fuck, dude?

708
01:08:01,284 --> 01:08:02,684
What are you guys talking about?

709
01:08:03,085 --> 01:08:04,872
What they always talk about.

710
01:08:05,073 --> 01:08:06,514
I actually think it will end,

711
01:08:06,716 --> 01:08:08,273
for a little while, at least.

712
01:08:08,474 --> 01:08:09,474
What do you mean?

713
01:08:10,752 --> 01:08:12,465
So I was going over all of my data research

714
01:08:12,666 --> 01:08:14,306
and I charted out all of the big events

715
01:08:14,386 --> 01:08:16,526
The Ironworks explosion in 1908

716
01:08:16,628 --> 01:08:18,433
The Bradley Gang in '35

717
01:08:18,634 --> 01:08:20,737
and The Black Spot in '62.

718
01:08:20,838 --> 01:08:22,808
And now the kids being...

719
01:08:25,854 --> 01:08:28,485
I realized that this stuff seems to happen

720
01:08:28,687 --> 01:08:30,221
(Bill and Ben) every 27 years.

721
01:08:34,189 --> 01:08:35,814
Ok so let me get this straight

722
01:08:35,914 --> 01:08:38,192
IT comes out from wherever to eat kids for like a year

723
01:08:38,292 --> 01:08:40,280
and then what? IT just goes into hibernation?

724
01:08:40,482 --> 01:08:42,822
Maybe it's like ... What do you call it?

725
01:08:43,024 --> 01:08:44,382
Cicadas.

726
01:08:44,482 --> 01:08:46,381
You know, the bugs that come out once every 17 years.

727
01:08:47,671 --> 01:08:49,431
My grandfather thinks this town is cursed

728
01:08:50,514 --> 01:08:51,548
He says

729
01:08:51,749 --> 01:08:53,545
that all the bad things that happened in this town

730
01:08:53,746 --> 01:08:55,403
are because of one thing

731
01:08:55,603 --> 01:08:58,247
An evil thing that feeds off the people of Derry.

732
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:00,632
But it can't be one thing.

733
01:09:01,775 --> 01:09:03,387
We all saw something different.

734
01:09:04,069 --> 01:09:05,111
Maybe

735
01:09:05,311 --> 01:09:07,741
Or maybe IT knows what scares us most and that's what we see.

736
01:09:08,142 --> 01:09:09,930
I-I saw a leper.

737
01:09:11,095 --> 01:09:13,147
He was like a walking infection.

738
01:09:13,909 --> 01:09:15,024
But you didn't

739
01:09:16,767 --> 01:09:18,317
Because IT isn't real.

740
01:09:18,718 --> 01:09:19,992
None of this is.

741
01:09:20,851 --> 01:09:22,140
Not Eddie's leper

742
01:09:22,340 --> 01:09:24,433
or Bill seeing Georgie

743
01:09:24,934 --> 01:09:27,151
or the woman I keep seeing.

744
01:09:27,451 --> 01:09:28,451
Is she hot?

745
01:09:30,089 --> 01:09:31,214
No. Richie.

746
01:09:31,915 --> 01:09:32,915
She's not hot

747
01:09:33,476 --> 01:09:36,014
Her face is all messed up.

748
01:09:37,450 --> 01:09:39,910
None of this makes any sense.

749
01:09:40,720 --> 01:09:42,224
They're all like bad dreams.

750
01:09:42,424 --> 01:09:47,139
I don't think so, I know the difference between a bad dream and real life, okay?

751
01:09:48,029 --> 01:09:50,302
What did you see? You saw something too?

752
01:09:50,403 --> 01:09:51,403
Yes.

753
01:09:53,197 --> 01:09:55,803
You guys know that burnt down house on Harris Avenue?

754
01:09:57,506 --> 01:09:59,692
I was inside when it burned down

755
01:10:02,897 --> 01:10:04,087
Before I rescued ...

756
01:10:04,188 --> 01:10:07,654
my mom and dad were trapped in the next room over from me.

757
01:10:07,812 --> 01:10:12,397
They were pushing and pounding on the door

758
01:10:14,717 --> 01:10:16,208
trying to get to me.

759
01:10:16,410 --> 01:10:17,410
Hurry up, son!

760
01:10:17,709 --> 01:10:18,910
I'm burning!

761
01:10:19,917 --> 01:10:21,194
But it was too hot

762
01:10:22,862 --> 01:10:24,939
When firefighters found them

763
01:10:28,166 --> 01:10:32,704
the skin on their hands melted down to the bone.

764
01:10:35,449 --> 01:10:37,073
We're all afraid of something.

765
01:10:37,577 --> 01:10:38,987
got that right.

766
01:10:39,622 --> 01:10:41,660
Why Rich? What are you afraid of?

767
01:10:45,069 --> 01:10:46,371
Clowns.

768
01:11:14,929 --> 01:11:15,929
Okay.

769
01:11:17,021 --> 01:11:18,159
Look.

770
01:11:19,771 --> 01:11:20,771
Storm drain

771
01:11:20,914 --> 01:11:22,799
That's were Georgie disappeared,

772
01:11:23,099 --> 01:11:24,984
there's the Ironworks,

773
01:11:25,185 --> 01:11:26,669
and the Black Spot.

774
01:11:27,537 --> 01:11:30,896
Everywhere IT happens it's-it's all connected by the sewers

775
01:11:33,722 --> 01:11:34,782
and they all meet up at the

776
01:11:34,806 --> 01:11:36,006
(Ben) the well-house.

777
01:11:39,178 --> 01:11:40,378
You mean the house on Neibolt Street

778
01:11:41,302 --> 01:11:44,312
You mean the creepy-ass house where all the junkies and hobos like to sleep?

779
01:11:45,588 --> 01:11:46,939
I hate that place.

780
01:11:47,584 --> 01:11:49,727
Always feels like it's watching me.

781
01:11:50,228 --> 01:11:51,301
That's where I saw IT

782
01:11:52,100 --> 01:11:53,652
There I saw a clown.

783
01:11:56,708 --> 01:11:58,134
Tha-tha-tha-that's where IT lives.

784
01:12:00,111 --> 01:12:02,424
I can't imagine anything ever wanting to live there.

785
01:12:02,620 --> 01:12:03,943
Can we stop talking about this?

786
01:12:04,043 --> 01:12:06,001
I can barely breathe

787
01:12:06,202 --> 01:12:07,402
It's summer.

788
01:12:07,562 --> 01:12:09,327
we're kids, I can barely breathe

789
01:12:09,428 --> 01:12:10,796
having a fucking asthma attack

790
01:12:11,317 --> 01:12:12,525
and fuck doing this.

791
01:12:13,124 --> 01:12:14,732
What the hell! Put the map back!

792
01:12:23,163 --> 01:12:24,565
What happened?

793
01:12:24,966 --> 01:12:26,256
What's going on?

794
01:12:27,074 --> 01:12:28,208
I don't know, look!

795
01:12:30,343 --> 01:12:31,071
guys...

796
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:38,658
Georgie.

797
01:12:40,369 --> 01:12:41,369
Bill?

798
01:12:58,087 --> 01:12:59,225
WHAT THE FUCK!

799
01:12:59,961 --> 01:13:01,245
It's IT

800
01:13:02,446 --> 01:13:05,509
WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT?

801
01:13:05,909 --> 01:13:07,127
I DON'T FUCKING KNOW!

802
01:13:11,532 --> 01:13:13,358
Turn it off!

803
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:15,444
Yes, Turn it off!

804
01:13:34,617 --> 01:13:35,814
Run, Stanley!

805
01:13:37,980 --> 01:13:39,328
What is that?

806
01:13:39,766 --> 01:13:40,766
What's up?

807
01:13:55,706 --> 01:13:56,805
Thanks, Ben.

808
01:13:58,940 --> 01:14:00,278
IT saw us

809
01:14:01,328 --> 01:14:02,992
IT saw us and It knows where we are.

810
01:14:03,493 --> 01:14:04,526
IT always knew.

811
01:14:04,925 --> 01:14:06,525
Alright Stan, so let's go.

812
01:14:07,654 --> 01:14:08,654
Go?

813
01:14:09,151 --> 01:14:10,359
Go where?

814
01:14:10,360 --> 01:14:11,460
Neibolt.

815
01:14:11,945 --> 01:14:15,030
That's where G-g-g-Georgie is.

816
01:14:15,331 --> 01:14:16,506
After that?

817
01:14:17,206 --> 01:14:19,705
Yeah, it's summer, we should be outside...

818
01:14:19,764 --> 01:14:22,633
If you say it's summer one more f-f-f-fucking time

819
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:29,400
Bill?

820
01:14:30,362 --> 01:14:31,564
Wait!

821
01:15:01,777 --> 01:15:05,377
"He t-t-t-thrusts his fists

822
01:15:05,478 --> 01:15:07,378
"Against the p-p-post"

823
01:15:07,579 --> 01:15:10,952
"and still insists he sees the g-g-g-ghost"

824
01:15:12,140 --> 01:15:13,140
Bill!

825
01:15:14,116 --> 01:15:16,062
Bill, you can't go in there.

826
01:15:16,264 --> 01:15:17,264
This is crazy.

827
01:15:17,364 --> 01:15:19,169
Look, you don't have to come in with me,

828
01:15:20,070 --> 01:15:23,415
but what happens when another Georgie goes missing,

829
01:15:25,401 --> 01:15:28,685
or another Betty or another Ed Corcoran or one of us?

830
01:15:29,385 --> 01:15:32,690
Are you just going to pretend it didn't happen like everyone else in this town?

831
01:15:33,703 --> 01:15:35,649
Because I can't.

832
01:15:38,246 --> 01:15:42,528
I go home and all I see is that Georgie isn't there,

833
01:15:43,683 --> 01:15:47,570
his clothes, his toys, his stupid stuffed animals

834
01:15:48,350 --> 01:15:49,891
but he isn't.

835
01:15:51,290 --> 01:15:53,300
So walking into this house

836
01:15:56,264 --> 01:15:58,021
for me...

837
01:15:58,223 --> 01:16:00,628
it's easier that walking into my own.

838
01:16:05,054 --> 01:16:06,064
Wow.

839
01:16:06,165 --> 01:16:07,165
What?

840
01:16:07,519 --> 01:16:09,053
He didn't stutter once.

841
01:16:12,982 --> 01:16:14,100
Wait!

842
01:16:17,081 --> 01:16:20,316
Uhhh, shouldn't we have some people keep watch,

843
01:16:22,630 --> 01:16:25,238
just in case something bad happens?

844
01:16:28,307 --> 01:16:30,737
Wh-wh-wh-who wants to stay out here?

845
01:16:38,361 --> 01:16:39,361
Fuck.

846
01:16:48,103 --> 01:16:50,035
I can't believe i pulled the short straw

847
01:16:51,143 --> 01:16:52,993
you guys are lucky you're not measuring dicks.

848
01:16:53,194 --> 01:16:54,584
Shut up, Richie.

849
01:16:58,055 --> 01:16:59,700
I can smell that.

850
01:17:00,198 --> 01:17:01,683
Don't breathe through your mouth.

851
01:17:01,882 --> 01:17:02,882
Home come?

852
01:17:03,484 --> 01:17:05,021
Cause then you're eating it. (Eddie retching)

853
01:17:31,765 --> 01:17:32,785
What?

854
01:17:33,511 --> 01:17:35,188
It, it says I'm missing.

855
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:38,331
Y-y-y-you're not missing, Richie.

856
01:17:40,247 --> 01:17:42,839
Then why's it say it there, it's my shirt, that's my hair, that's my face...

857
01:17:42,940 --> 01:17:44,041
Calm down, this isn't real.

858
01:17:44,141 --> 01:17:45,519
That's my name, that's my age, that's the date...

859
01:17:45,619 --> 01:17:46,659
This isn't real, Richie

860
01:17:46,732 --> 01:17:48,353
What the fuck? It says I'm missing.

861
01:17:48,454 --> 01:17:51,094
- Am I missing? Will I disappear? - Take it easy.

862
01:17:51,196 --> 01:17:52,991
Look at me, Richie. Look at me.

863
01:17:54,058 --> 01:17:55,982
This isn't real.

864
01:17:56,183 --> 01:17:58,120
IT's playing tricks on you.

865
01:17:58,950 --> 01:18:00,232
Hello?

866
01:18:03,596 --> 01:18:05,037
Hello?

867
01:18:09,299 --> 01:18:11,242
Help me please!

868
01:18:47,648 --> 01:18:48,670
Betty?

869
01:18:49,147 --> 01:18:50,231
Ripsom?

870
01:19:00,633 --> 01:19:01,837
Eddie...

871
01:19:04,484 --> 01:19:06,950
What are you looking for?

872
01:19:09,202 --> 01:19:10,819
Guys, do you hear that?

873
01:19:32,119 --> 01:19:35,137
She was just here, where the fuck did she go?

874
01:19:35,939 --> 01:19:36,939
Guys?

875
01:19:45,131 --> 01:19:46,621
Guys!

876
01:19:47,913 --> 01:19:50,268
-Guys! -Eddie!

877
01:19:52,154 --> 01:19:53,684
What the fuck!

878
01:20:03,017 --> 01:20:05,761
Time to take your pill, Eddie.

879
01:20:19,300 --> 01:20:21,785
- Eddie. Open the door! - Richie.

880
01:20:22,623 --> 01:20:23,791
Are you okay?

881
01:20:24,687 --> 01:20:25,687
Eddie, what's going on?

882
01:20:26,113 --> 01:20:27,113
Eds.

883
01:20:27,841 --> 01:20:28,888
Eddie.

884
01:20:29,488 --> 01:20:30,530
Hiya Richie.

885
01:20:31,172 --> 01:20:32,284
Eddie.

886
01:20:34,664 --> 01:20:35,854
Eddie.

887
01:20:41,117 --> 01:20:42,400
Eddie.

888
01:20:43,167 --> 01:20:44,622
Where the fuck are you

889
01:20:45,952 --> 01:20:47,672
We're not playing hide and seek, dipshit.

890
01:20:51,180 --> 01:20:52,208
Richie?

891
01:20:55,054 --> 01:20:56,661
Richie!

892
01:20:56,760 --> 01:20:57,961
Bill, open the door.

893
01:20:58,062 --> 01:20:59,062
It won't open.

894
01:20:59,161 --> 01:21:00,833
- What's going on? Richie! - I can't!

895
01:21:00,933 --> 01:21:02,033
Open the door, Rich.

896
01:21:08,126 --> 01:21:09,242
Oh shit.

897
01:21:38,804 --> 01:21:40,042
Stupid clowns.

898
01:21:47,855 --> 01:21:49,237
Oh fuck.

899
01:22:29,390 --> 01:22:30,631
Beep-beep, Richie.

900
01:22:36,044 --> 01:22:37,044
Let's get out of here.

901
01:22:44,234 --> 01:22:45,490
You wanna play loogie?

902
01:23:35,516 --> 01:23:36,678
Time to float.

903
01:24:14,453 --> 01:24:15,516
Where's my shoe?

904
01:24:20,505 --> 01:24:21,596
Where the fuck were her legs?

905
01:24:22,550 --> 01:24:24,376
What about that?

906
01:24:24,577 --> 01:24:25,612
This isn't real.

907
01:24:25,713 --> 01:24:27,078
Remember the missing kid poster

908
01:24:27,179 --> 01:24:28,804
that wasn't real, so this isn't real

909
01:24:30,550 --> 01:24:33,710
Tasty, tasty, beautiful fear.

910
01:24:36,994 --> 01:24:38,068
Come on. Ready?

911
01:24:38,169 --> 01:24:39,169
No.

912
01:24:41,576 --> 01:24:42,601
No.

913
01:24:46,213 --> 01:24:47,535
No!

914
01:24:48,637 --> 01:24:49,848
Oh thank fuck.

915
01:24:50,374 --> 01:24:51,448
Where's Eddie?

916
01:24:51,749 --> 01:24:53,147
Help!

917
01:24:55,489 --> 01:24:56,489
Eddie!

918
01:24:58,328 --> 01:25:00,061
Oh fuck.

919
01:25:00,163 --> 01:25:01,262
Eddie?

920
01:25:03,530 --> 01:25:05,720
This isn't real enough for you, Billy?

921
01:25:07,220 --> 01:25:08,742
I'm not real enough for you?

922
01:25:08,943 --> 01:25:10,542
Holy shit!

923
01:25:10,698 --> 01:25:13,160
It was real enough for Georgie.

924
01:25:25,573 --> 01:25:27,093
-Get Eddie -Get Eddie

925
01:25:30,375 --> 01:25:32,663
Whoops! Let's get outta here.

926
01:25:39,360 --> 01:25:40,732
Go for Eddie. Come on!

927
01:25:40,833 --> 01:25:41,933
Guys, watch out!

928
01:25:42,084 --> 01:25:44,182
-Don't -Eddie, look at me

929
01:25:44,282 --> 01:25:46,082
Guys!

930
01:25:46,183 --> 01:25:47,618
No!

931
01:25:52,901 --> 01:25:54,606
- I! - I!

932
01:26:02,331 --> 01:26:03,430
Let's get outta here!

933
01:26:04,568 --> 01:26:05,955
Let's get outta here!

934
01:26:16,425 --> 01:26:17,792
Bill, we have to help Eddie.

935
01:26:17,994 --> 01:26:19,607
Nooooo, Nooooo!

936
01:26:21,338 --> 01:26:23,279
- I put the arm in place. - Don't fucking touch me!

937
01:26:23,380 --> 01:26:26,765
- Well, one, two, three. - Don't fucking touch me!

938
01:26:28,876 --> 01:26:30,168
Shit!

939
01:26:32,112 --> 01:26:34,370
You, you did this,

940
01:26:34,852 --> 01:26:36,684
You know how delicate he is.

941
01:26:36,785 --> 01:26:39,786
-We were attacked, Mrs. K

942
01:26:40,721 --> 01:26:42,492
No, don't, don't try to blame anyone else...

943
01:26:45,090 --> 01:26:46,359
-Let me -Get back!

944
01:26:48,736 --> 01:26:50,702
Oh, I've heard of you Miss Marsh...

945
01:26:50,857 --> 01:26:53,838
and I don't want a dirty girl like you touching my Eddie.

946
01:26:56,303 --> 01:26:57,820
Ms. K, I ...

947
01:26:57,921 --> 01:27:00,976
No, you are all monsters, all of you,

948
01:27:01,276 --> 01:27:05,091
Now Eddie's done with you, you hear, done!

949
01:27:30,103 --> 01:27:31,141
I saw the well

950
01:27:31,342 --> 01:27:33,224
W-w-w-w-we know where it is

951
01:27:33,425 --> 01:27:36,082
and next time we'll be better prepared.

952
01:27:36,338 --> 01:27:37,627
NO!

953
01:27:38,211 --> 01:27:39,291
No next time, Bill.

954
01:27:40,772 --> 01:27:42,582
You're insane.

955
01:27:42,683 --> 01:27:45,327
Why? We all know nobody else is going to do anything

956
01:27:45,427 --> 01:27:47,805
Eddie was nearly killed and look at this motherfucker,

957
01:27:48,005 --> 01:27:49,832
he's leaking hamburger helper.

958
01:27:49,933 --> 01:27:51,093
We can't pretend it's going to go away

959
01:27:51,135 --> 01:27:53,949
Ben, you said yourself it comes back every 27 years.

960
01:27:54,149 --> 01:27:56,977
Fine! I'll be 40 and far away from here.

961
01:27:58,077 --> 01:27:59,974
I thought you said you wanted to get out of this town too.

962
01:28:00,276 --> 01:28:03,020
Because I want to run towards something, not away.

963
01:28:03,720 --> 01:28:05,608
I'm sorry but who invited Molly Ringwald into the group?

964
01:28:06,936 --> 01:28:09,085
- Richie ... - I'm just saying, lets face facts

965
01:28:09,286 --> 01:28:10,286
real world

966
01:28:10,387 --> 01:28:13,081
Georgie is dead, stop trying to get us killed too.

967
01:28:13,182 --> 01:28:14,279
Georgie's not dead.

968
01:28:15,562 --> 01:28:17,916
You couldn't save him but you could still save yourself.

969
01:28:18,417 --> 01:28:20,977
No! T-t-t-take it back,

970
01:28:22,803 --> 01:28:25,973
you're scared and we all are but take it back.

971
01:28:28,538 --> 01:28:29,640
Bill!

972
01:28:31,451 --> 01:28:33,263
You're such a loser.

973
01:28:33,462 --> 01:28:34,793
- Richie, just.

974
01:28:34,895 --> 01:28:36,978
You're a bunch of losers, get us all killed...

975
01:28:37,079 --> 01:28:39,159
- while trying to catch a clown. - Stop!

976
01:28:42,014 --> 01:28:43,926
This is what IT wants,

977
01:28:44,028 --> 01:28:45,424
IT wants to divide us.

978
01:28:48,111 --> 01:28:50,939
When we're all together, when we heard it, that's why we're still alive.

979
01:28:51,140 --> 01:28:53,181
Yeah, well I plan to keep it that way.

980
01:29:07,767 --> 01:29:09,673
- Mike ... - Guys ...

981
01:29:10,874 --> 01:29:12,914
I can't do this.

982
01:29:14,534 --> 01:29:16,239
My granddad was right.

983
01:29:16,440 --> 01:29:19,240
I'm an outsider, gotta stay that way.

984
01:30:17,903 --> 01:30:19,712
Yeah, there we go.

985
01:30:19,813 --> 01:30:21,170
Put the next target there.

986
01:30:33,472 --> 01:30:35,150
Just hold it.

987
01:30:37,651 --> 01:30:39,484
What the hells going on here?

988
01:30:42,130 --> 01:30:45,287
Cleaning your gun, like you asked.

989
01:30:45,820 --> 01:30:47,949
You're cleaning my gun, huh?

990
01:30:51,752 --> 01:30:53,869
- Dad ... - Hey!

991
01:31:05,376 --> 01:31:06,769
Look at him now, boys.

992
01:31:07,945 --> 01:31:11,405
Ain't nothing like a little fear that'll make a paper man crumble.

993
01:31:21,887 --> 01:31:23,224
Here for the refills, Eddie?

994
01:31:23,426 --> 01:31:24,426
Yeah.

995
01:31:32,463 --> 01:31:33,918
You know it's all bullshit, right?

996
01:31:34,119 --> 01:31:35,119
What is?

997
01:31:36,018 --> 01:31:37,022
Your medication,

998
01:31:37,623 --> 01:31:38,874
they're placebos.

999
01:31:39,177 --> 01:31:40,177
What's "pa-cee-bo" mean?

1000
01:31:40,259 --> 01:31:41,764
Placebo means bullshit.

1001
01:31:44,755 --> 01:31:46,051
No friends, huh?

1002
01:31:46,973 --> 01:31:47,973
Your cast?

1003
01:31:48,379 --> 01:31:50,002
No signatures or anything?

1004
01:31:50,502 --> 01:31:51,503
So sad.

1005
01:31:52,850 --> 01:31:54,307
I don't want it to get dirty.

1006
01:31:55,326 --> 01:31:56,639
Oh, I'll sign it for ya.

1007
01:32:14,015 --> 01:32:15,388
You okay, Henry?

1008
01:33:24,988 --> 01:33:28,276
My most favorite part of the afternoon is

1009
01:33:28,378 --> 01:33:31,291
Learn all about many of you.

1010
01:33:31,492 --> 01:33:33,564
Is there anything you want to share?

1011
01:33:33,590 --> 01:33:35,498
- what most they enjoyed today?

1012
01:33:35,599 --> 01:33:36,720
How about you?

1013
01:33:36,820 --> 01:33:38,096
I enjoyed seeing the clown.

1014
01:33:38,197 --> 01:33:40,126
Really? Would you like to see the clown?

1015
01:33:40,227 --> 01:33:41,127
Yes!

1016
01:33:41,227 --> 01:33:42,915
What about it anyway?

1017
01:33:43,116 --> 01:33:44,552
I liked the bubbles floating.

1018
01:33:44,654 --> 01:33:46,482
Really? Me too.

1019
01:33:46,683 --> 01:33:48,971
I love seeing things float.

1020
01:33:49,171 --> 01:33:50,270
All float.

1021
01:33:50,372 --> 01:33:51,672
We all float,

1022
01:33:51,773 --> 01:33:53,918
and you will too, Henry.

1023
01:33:54,118 --> 01:33:55,929
Make it a wonderful day.

1024
01:33:56,029 --> 01:33:57,430
Kill him.

1025
01:33:58,231 --> 01:34:00,617
Kill him.

1026
01:34:01,117 --> 01:34:02,919
Kill him.

1027
01:34:03,020 --> 01:34:05,791
Kill him.

1028
01:34:06,800 --> 01:34:10,117
Oh no, give him a big round of applause.

1029
01:34:17,125 --> 01:34:18,875
Well done, Henry.

1030
01:34:18,900 --> 01:34:22,098
Kill them all.

1031
01:34:23,840 --> 01:34:25,383
Kill them all!

1032
01:34:25,584 --> 01:34:28,428
Kill them all!

1033
01:34:30,865 --> 01:34:32,845
Kill them all! (chanting)

1034
01:34:54,884 --> 01:34:57,150
Where are you sneaking off to?

1035
01:35:03,217 --> 01:35:04,857
No-nowhere, Daddy.

1036
01:35:06,582 --> 01:35:08,558
You look prettied up.

1037
01:35:09,787 --> 01:35:11,867
I'm not prettied up, daddy. I wear this almost every day.

1038
01:35:13,150 --> 01:35:14,389
Come here.

1039
01:35:30,066 --> 01:35:32,818
You know I worry about you Bevvie.

1040
01:35:33,220 --> 01:35:34,562
I know.

1041
01:35:34,921 --> 01:35:39,691
People in town have been saying some things to me about you.

1042
01:35:40,720 --> 01:35:43,813
Sneaking around all summer ling with a bunch of boy.

1043
01:35:44,476 --> 01:35:46,247
Only girl in the pack.

1044
01:35:46,448 --> 01:35:48,857
They're just friends, I swear.

1045
01:35:49,136 --> 01:35:54,843
I know what's in boys minds when they look at you Bevvie.

1046
01:35:55,185 --> 01:35:57,252
I know it all too well.

1047
01:35:57,429 --> 01:35:59,222
My hand...

1048
01:35:59,422 --> 01:36:04,835
Are you doing womanly things down in the woods with those boys?

1049
01:36:04,937 --> 01:36:08,508
N-n-n-nothing, you don't have to worry. I promise.

1050
01:36:09,248 --> 01:36:10,248
What's this?

1051
01:36:11,749 --> 01:36:13,803
It's nothing, it's just a poem.

1052
01:36:15,492 --> 01:36:16,712
Just a poem?

1053
01:36:16,813 --> 01:36:19,104
That you were hiding in your underwear drawer?

1054
01:36:20,037 --> 01:36:22,747
Why would you have to hide it there?

1055
01:36:24,938 --> 01:36:26,424
Are you still my girl?

1056
01:36:26,926 --> 01:36:27,926
No.

1057
01:36:28,112 --> 01:36:29,235
What did you say?

1058
01:36:29,737 --> 01:36:31,546
I said no!

1059
01:36:34,742 --> 01:36:35,742
No!

1060
01:36:37,302 --> 01:36:39,053
Get away, no!

1061
01:36:41,028 --> 01:36:42,308
No, get off!

1062
01:36:42,727 --> 01:36:43,727
No!

1063
01:36:46,634 --> 01:36:50,074
Those boys, do they know that you're...

1064
01:38:15,440 --> 01:38:16,943
Beverly?

1065
01:38:41,996 --> 01:38:43,674
Beverly!

1066
01:38:52,211 --> 01:38:54,471
- Richie. - What do you want?

1067
01:38:55,105 --> 01:38:57,339
You see that guy I'm hitting, I'm pretending it's you.

1068
01:38:58,681 --> 01:38:59,724
IT got Beverly.

1069
01:38:59,937 --> 01:39:01,411
What are you talking about?

1070
01:39:02,937 --> 01:39:04,377
IT, Richie.

1071
01:39:04,991 --> 01:39:06,560
IT got Beverly.

1072
01:39:21,272 --> 01:39:22,608
Hello?

1073
01:39:25,514 --> 01:39:26,812
Okay

1074
01:39:28,421 --> 01:39:29,876
I'll be there.

1075
01:39:36,468 --> 01:39:38,022
And just where do you thing you're off to?

1076
01:39:38,324 --> 01:39:39,364
Out with my friends.

1077
01:39:40,233 --> 01:39:42,664
Sweetie, you can't go,

1078
01:39:42,865 --> 01:39:44,505
you're getting over your sickness, remember?

1079
01:39:45,308 --> 01:39:46,824
My sickness?

1080
01:39:46,925 --> 01:39:48,784
Ok, what, what sickness, Mom?

1081
01:39:51,310 --> 01:39:53,788
Do you know what these are? They're "gazebos".

1082
01:39:53,889 --> 01:39:54,989
They're bullshit!

1083
01:40:01,500 --> 01:40:03,293
They help you, Eddie.

1084
01:40:04,334 --> 01:40:06,079
I had to protect you.

1085
01:40:06,180 --> 01:40:07,579
Protect me?

1086
01:40:07,781 --> 01:40:10,739
By lying to me and keeping me locked inside of this hell-hole?

1087
01:40:10,840 --> 01:40:14,840
I'm sorry but the only people trying to protect me are my friends.

1088
01:40:14,941 --> 01:40:17,107
and you made me turn my back when I really needed them.

1089
01:40:17,308 --> 01:40:18,308
So I'm going.

1090
01:40:18,427 --> 01:40:21,323
Eddie. No.

1091
01:40:21,424 --> 01:40:22,517
You get right back here.

1092
01:40:22,717 --> 01:40:24,642
I'm going to see my friends. -Eddie

1093
01:40:24,749 --> 01:40:26,530
Don't do this to me, Eddie.

1094
01:40:51,992 --> 01:40:53,147
Guys, spikes.

1095
01:41:42,783 --> 01:41:43,783
Stan?

1096
01:41:46,281 --> 01:41:48,081
Stan, we all have to go,

1097
01:41:48,337 --> 01:41:50,513
Bevvie was right.

1098
01:41:51,414 --> 01:41:55,090
If we split up like last time, that clown will kill us, one by one,

1099
01:41:56,091 --> 01:41:58,899
but if we stick together,

1100
01:42:00,412 --> 01:42:01,758
all of us...

1101
01:42:03,479 --> 01:42:04,976
we'll win.

1102
01:42:05,735 --> 01:42:06,866
I promise.

1103
01:42:33,514 --> 01:42:36,189
Eddie, you got a quarter?

1104
01:42:37,656 --> 01:42:40,041
I wouldn't want to make a wish in that fucking thing.

1105
01:42:44,932 --> 01:42:46,701
Beverly (echoing)

1106
01:42:46,766 --> 01:42:47,927
How are we supposed to get down there?

1107
01:42:50,101 --> 01:42:51,653
Alright lets go.

1108
01:43:08,570 --> 01:43:09,844
Alright buddy.

1109
01:44:50,014 --> 01:44:52,091
Guys, help?

1110
01:44:54,297 --> 01:44:55,726
- You're good? - I'm fine.

1111
01:45:00,355 --> 01:45:03,544
Step right up, Beverly. Step right up.

1112
01:45:04,669 --> 01:45:08,376
Come change, come cold,

1113
01:45:08,578 --> 01:45:12,028
You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll cheer, you'll die

1114
01:45:12,940 --> 01:45:16,762
Introducing Pennywise the dancing clown.

1115
01:45:52,072 --> 01:45:53,608
I'm not afraid of you.

1116
01:46:00,657 --> 01:46:02,102
You will be...

1117
01:46:14,906 --> 01:46:17,365
Help me!

1118
01:46:28,538 --> 01:46:30,217
Go dead!

1119
01:46:33,248 --> 01:46:34,153
Mike!

1120
01:46:34,254 --> 01:46:35,721
-Mike! -Mike!

1121
01:46:36,422 --> 01:46:38,147
You okay, Mike?

1122
01:46:38,647 --> 01:46:39,674
Bowers.

1123
01:46:40,343 --> 01:46:41,643
Mike. Fuck.

1124
01:46:42,382 --> 01:46:44,187
- Mike! - Where is?

1125
01:46:45,480 --> 01:46:46,719
We're next.

1126
01:46:47,245 --> 01:46:48,537
No!

1127
01:46:48,639 --> 01:46:49,915
-Grab it, get the rope

1128
01:46:50,579 --> 01:46:51,609
Shit

1129
01:46:53,133 --> 01:46:54,403
Mike!

1130
01:46:55,325 --> 01:46:56,836
Leave him alone!

1131
01:46:58,555 --> 01:47:00,624
You didn't listen to what I told ya did ya?

1132
01:47:01,982 --> 01:47:04,547
You should've stayed out of Derry.

1133
01:47:04,849 --> 01:47:07,708
Your parents didn't' and look what happened to them.

1134
01:47:08,766 --> 01:47:11,358
I still get sad every time I pass that pile of ashes,

1135
01:47:11,728 --> 01:47:13,032
sad,

1136
01:47:14,083 --> 01:47:15,475
that I couldn't have done it myself.

1137
01:47:16,455 --> 01:47:18,046
Run, Mike!

1138
01:47:24,533 --> 01:47:25,718
Mike!

1139
01:47:26,999 --> 01:47:28,173
Down!

1140
01:47:31,054 --> 01:47:33,090
I sh-sh-sh-should get up there.

1141
01:47:33,491 --> 01:47:35,442
Are you insane? With what?

1142
01:48:03,944 --> 01:48:05,378
Holy shit!!!

1143
01:48:07,565 --> 01:48:09,233
- God ... - Mike!

1144
01:48:09,935 --> 01:48:11,245
I'm okay.

1145
01:48:11,946 --> 01:48:12,997
I'm okay.

1146
01:48:16,995 --> 01:48:18,202
Shit.

1147
01:48:19,629 --> 01:48:21,283
Stanley.

1148
01:48:22,256 --> 01:48:23,593
Beverly.

1149
01:48:26,535 --> 01:48:27,893
Is that you?

1150
01:48:36,685 --> 01:48:37,685
Guys?

1151
01:48:41,125 --> 01:48:42,354
Guys?

1152
01:48:46,787 --> 01:48:48,839
Come on, guys, where's Stan?

1153
01:48:48,941 --> 01:48:49,941
Stanley

1154
01:48:50,141 --> 01:48:51,640
Stanley

1155
01:48:51,742 --> 01:48:52,742
Stan

1156
01:48:54,293 --> 01:48:55,831
Oh shit, gray water.

1157
01:48:58,812 --> 01:48:59,812
Stan?

1158
01:49:00,723 --> 01:49:01,835
Stan?

1159
01:49:03,046 --> 01:49:04,046
Stanley!

1160
01:49:29,005 --> 01:49:30,537
- Stan!- Wow! Stanley!

1161
01:49:31,605 --> 01:49:32,641
Stanley!

1162
01:49:33,442 --> 01:49:35,202
- Now come on, man! - Here we go! Quiet.

1163
01:49:38,536 --> 01:49:40,909
-Stan? - Stanley! Stan!

1164
01:49:41,010 --> 01:49:42,073
Your flashlight!

1165
01:49:45,854 --> 01:49:47,803
What the fuck is that thing?

1166
01:49:48,104 --> 01:49:49,104
Oh shit!

1167
01:49:55,339 --> 01:49:56,398
Fuck.

1168
01:50:03,757 --> 01:50:04,779
Shit!

1169
01:50:05,765 --> 01:50:06,787
Holy shit!

1170
01:50:07,976 --> 01:50:08,857
Stanley!

1171
01:50:08,958 --> 01:50:10,832
Stanley! -Stan! -Stanley

1172
01:50:11,034 --> 01:50:14,280
No!

1173
01:50:14,281 --> 01:50:15,281
It's okay.

1174
01:50:15,482 --> 01:50:18,443
You left me,

1175
01:50:18,444 --> 01:50:19,814
you aren't my friends.

1176
01:50:19,880 --> 01:50:21,759
You made me go, you made me go!

1177
01:50:21,860 --> 01:50:22,951
I'm sorry.

1178
01:50:23,079 --> 01:50:24,642
You made me go to Neibolt.

1179
01:50:26,743 --> 01:50:28,188
This is your fault.

1180
01:50:31,085 --> 01:50:34,253
We would never let anything happen to you. We're here.

1181
01:50:34,354 --> 01:50:37,645
You know I wouldn't do that. Come on.

1182
01:50:37,747 --> 01:50:39,746
Bill!

1183
01:50:40,915 --> 01:50:41,915
Bill!

1184
01:50:41,955 --> 01:50:43,269
Bill!

1185
01:51:15,217 --> 01:51:16,368
Beverly!

1186
01:51:42,974 --> 01:51:44,615
I'll come back for you. Bev.

1187
01:51:52,287 --> 01:51:53,498
Bill?

1188
01:51:56,522 --> 01:51:57,549
Bill

1189
01:52:00,456 --> 01:52:01,470
Bill

1190
01:52:02,782 --> 01:52:04,821
Come on, get out of there Ed, That's gray water.

1191
01:52:05,023 --> 01:52:07,068
W-w-w-wait, where's my fucking flashlight?

1192
01:52:07,789 --> 01:52:08,850
Eddie!

1193
01:52:13,437 --> 01:52:15,766
Let's get the fuck outta here, come on.

1194
01:52:33,189 --> 01:52:34,883
Bev? Bev?

1195
01:52:35,923 --> 01:52:37,463
Bev? Oh shit

1196
01:52:38,294 --> 01:52:39,325
Bev.

1197
01:52:45,413 --> 01:52:47,127
How is she in the air?

1198
01:52:49,271 --> 01:52:50,656
Guys,

1199
01:52:52,202 --> 01:52:53,202

1200
01:52:54,102 --> 01:52:55,422
the missing kids,

1201
01:52:56,442 --> 01:52:57,519
Floating.

1202
01:52:59,158 --> 01:53:01,015
Just let me grab her.

1203
01:53:06,664 --> 01:53:07,977
I'm slipping

1204
01:53:16,354 --> 01:53:17,354
Bev.

1205
01:53:18,763 --> 01:53:20,013
Beverly.

1206
01:53:20,113 --> 01:53:21,924
Why isn't she waking up?

1207
01:53:22,125 --> 01:53:23,857
What's wrong with her?

1208
01:53:23,957 --> 01:53:26,137
Beverly, please! Come on!

1209
01:53:39,400 --> 01:53:40,485
Woah, woah, woah...

1210
01:53:45,104 --> 01:53:46,311
Bev?

1211
01:53:50,865 --> 01:53:52,391
"January embers?"

1212
01:53:52,892 --> 01:53:55,113
"My heart burns there too."

1213
01:53:57,209 --> 01:53:58,991
Jesus, fuck...

1214
01:54:00,415 --> 01:54:01,929
oh, god.

1215
01:54:11,063 --> 01:54:12,484
Where is Bill?

1216
01:54:16,945 --> 01:54:18,317
Georgie.

1217
01:54:21,984 --> 01:54:23,326
What took you so long?

1218
01:54:27,610 --> 01:54:30,539
I was looking for you this whole time.

1219
01:54:31,910 --> 01:54:34,806
I couldn't find my way outta here.

1220
01:54:37,623 --> 01:54:40,127
He saidI could have my boat back, Billy.

1221
01:54:45,786 --> 01:54:47,096
Was she fast?

1222
01:54:47,830 --> 01:54:50,111
I couldn't keep up with it.

1223
01:54:52,328 --> 01:54:53,492
"she" Georgie.

1224
01:54:56,643 --> 01:54:58,173
They call boats, She.

1225
01:55:00,956 --> 01:55:02,852
Take me home, Billy.

1226
01:55:10,111 --> 01:55:11,768
I wanna go home.

1227
01:55:15,421 --> 01:55:19,141
I miss you, I wanna be with mom and dad.

1228
01:55:21,071 --> 01:55:24,582
I want more than anything for you to be home,

1229
01:55:26,934 --> 01:55:29,841
With Mom and Dad.

1230
01:55:31,925 --> 01:55:34,452
I miss you so much.

1231
01:55:39,254 --> 01:55:40,995
I love you, Billy.

1232
01:55:42,643 --> 01:55:43,898
I love you too,

1233
01:55:52,991 --> 01:55:54,528
But you're not Georgie.

1234
01:56:40,373 --> 01:56:41,568
Kill him now, Billy! Kill him!

1235
01:56:41,669 --> 01:56:42,707
Shit!

1236
01:56:42,908 --> 01:56:44,614
Kill him, Bill

1237
01:56:45,515 --> 01:56:46,735
Kill him, Bill

1238
01:56:47,503 --> 01:56:48,591
Kill him!

1239
01:56:48,792 --> 01:56:49,892
Kill him! (all screaming)

1240
01:56:50,093 --> 01:56:51,093
Kill IT!

1241
01:56:51,393 --> 01:56:52,449
It's not loaded

1242
01:56:52,550 --> 01:56:54,895
Do it, Bill! Kill him!

1243
01:56:56,245 --> 01:56:57,811
Hey, it's not loaded!

1244
01:57:00,840 --> 01:57:02,182
Dammit.

1245
01:57:03,563 --> 01:57:04,596
Fuck.

1246
01:57:12,167 --> 01:57:13,167
Bill, watch out!

1247
01:57:16,815 --> 01:57:17,840
Leave him alone!

1248
01:57:20,110 --> 01:57:20,872
Beverly, no!

1249
01:57:20,974 --> 01:57:21,974
Mike!

1250
01:57:27,548 --> 01:57:28,548
Help him!

1251
01:57:29,468 --> 01:57:30,468
Shit

1252
01:57:32,288 --> 01:57:33,288
Ben!

1253
01:57:38,770 --> 01:57:39,770
Stanley!

1254
01:57:46,308 --> 01:57:47,594
Bill!

1255
01:57:48,796 --> 01:57:49,896
Bill!

1256
01:57:50,665 --> 01:57:51,970
No, don't let him go!

1257
01:57:52,732 --> 01:57:53,732
Let him go.

1258
01:57:54,117 --> 01:57:55,121
No.

1259
01:57:55,221 --> 01:57:57,121
I'll take him.

1260
01:57:57,322 --> 01:57:59,295
I'll take all of you.

1261
01:57:59,996 --> 01:58:04,279
and I'll feast on your flesh as I feed on your fear...

1262
01:58:07,808 --> 01:58:09,462
Oooooorrrrr

1263
01:58:11,157 --> 01:58:13,463
you'll just leave us be

1264
01:58:13,564 --> 01:58:16,617
I'm taking him, only him

1265
01:58:17,267 --> 01:58:19,396
And then I'll have my long rest

1266
01:58:19,596 --> 01:58:23,845
and you will all live to grow old

1267
01:58:24,104 --> 01:58:27,406
and drive and lead happy lives

1268
01:58:28,271 --> 01:58:31,721
until old age takes you back to the weeds.

1269
01:58:35,607 --> 01:58:36,809
Leave...

1270
01:58:39,129 --> 01:58:41,247
I'm the one who dragged you all into this

1271
01:58:42,663 --> 01:58:44,189
I'm s-s-s-s-, I'm s-s-sorry.

1272
01:58:44,290 --> 01:58:45,391
S-s-s-s-sorry (Pennywise laughs)

1273
01:58:49,840 --> 01:58:51,065
Go!

1274
01:58:53,668 --> 01:58:55,073
Guys, we can't.

1275
01:58:56,949 --> 01:58:58,711
Sorry, Bill.

1276
01:59:01,263 --> 01:59:02,716
I told you, Bill.

1277
01:59:03,207 --> 01:59:04,382
I fucking told you,

1278
01:59:05,375 --> 01:59:07,449
I don't want to die...

1279
01:59:08,164 --> 01:59:09,357
It's your fault.

1280
01:59:11,864 --> 01:59:13,715
You punched me in the face,

1281
01:59:13,916 --> 01:59:15,517
you made me walk through shitty water,

1282
01:59:15,618 --> 01:59:17,138
you brought me to a fucking crackhead-house.

1283
01:59:18,681 --> 01:59:20,071
And now...

1284
01:59:23,682 --> 01:59:25,437
I'm gonna have to kill this fucking clown!

1285
01:59:26,257 --> 01:59:27,876
Welcome to the losers club, asshole!!!!!

1286
01:59:35,484 --> 01:59:36,968

1287
01:59:42,802 --> 01:59:44,006
Stan, look out!

1288
01:59:46,752 --> 01:59:47,752
Mike!

1289
01:59:57,288 --> 01:59:58,325
Kill him

1290
02:00:26,726 --> 02:00:28,546
I'm gonna kill you

1291
02:00:34,104 --> 02:00:36,955
Hey Bevvie, are you still my little girl?

1292
02:00:46,533 --> 02:00:47,533
Holy shit!

1293
02:01:07,511 --> 02:01:09,496
That's why you didn't kill Beverly,

1294
02:01:10,833 --> 02:01:13,974
Cause s-s-s-s-she wasn't afraid

1295
02:01:14,973 --> 02:01:16,472
and we aren't either

1296
02:01:17,373 --> 02:01:18,811
not anymore.

1297
02:01:21,181 --> 02:01:23,342
Now you're the one that's afraid,

1298
02:01:25,031 --> 02:01:26,527
because you're gonna starve.

1299
02:01:33,691 --> 02:01:36,330
"He thrusts his hands against the post...

1300
02:01:36,431 --> 02:01:39,831
"and still insists he sees the ghost.

1301
02:01:40,032 --> 02:01:43,139
"He thrusts his hands against the p-p-p-p-post"

1302
02:02:02,665 --> 02:02:03,773
Fear...

1303
02:02:15,686 --> 02:02:18,418
I know what I'm doing for my summer experience essay.

1304
02:02:31,198 --> 02:02:33,280
Hey guys.

1305
02:02:34,854 --> 02:02:37,081
The kids are floating down.

1306
02:03:46,827 --> 02:03:49,859
September

1307
02:03:55,546 --> 02:03:58,012
I only remember parts, but ...

1308
02:03:59,287 --> 02:04:00,981
I thought i was dead.

1309
02:04:02,352 --> 02:04:04,067
That's what it felt like.

1310
02:04:05,267 --> 02:04:08,530
I saw us, saw us together, back in the cistern,

1311
02:04:08,730 --> 02:04:10,277
but we were older ...

1312
02:04:11,278 --> 02:04:13,333
I mean our parents ages.

1313
02:04:14,322 --> 02:04:17,695
W-w-w-what were we all doing there?

1314
02:04:18,196 --> 02:04:20,196
I just remembered how we felt,

1315
02:04:21,951 --> 02:04:23,675
how scared we were,

1316
02:04:23,787 --> 02:04:26,093
I don't think I can ever forget that.

1317
02:04:31,550 --> 02:04:32,563
Swear,

1318
02:04:33,531 --> 02:04:34,844
swear

1319
02:04:35,445 --> 02:04:37,357
if IT isn't dead,

1320
02:04:38,058 --> 02:04:41,484
if IT ever comes back, we'll come back too.

1321
02:06:06,283 --> 02:06:07,336
I gotta go...

1322
02:06:10,235 --> 02:06:11,235
I hate you.

1323
02:06:21,528 --> 02:06:23,265
I'll see you later.

1324
02:06:23,653 --> 02:06:24,653
Goodbye, Stan.

1325
02:06:30,293 --> 02:06:31,293
Good bye guys.

1326
02:06:31,537 --> 02:06:32,537
Goodbye, Mike.

1327
02:06:32,638 --> 02:06:33,638
See you later, loser

1328
02:06:35,721 --> 02:06:36,857
See you, Bill.

1329
02:06:36,958 --> 02:06:37,958
See you, Rich.

1330
02:06:38,057 --> 02:06:39,257
See you later.

1331
02:06:40,850 --> 02:06:42,338
Goodbye, Ben.

1332
02:06:46,836 --> 02:06:49,643
You all packed for Portland?

1333
02:06:50,674 --> 02:06:52,916
Yeah pretty much.

1334
02:06:53,218 --> 02:06:54,624
I'm going tomorrow morning.

1335
02:06:54,794 --> 02:06:56,470
How long will you be gone?

1336
02:06:58,333 --> 02:07:02,258
My aunt said I can stay for as long as I want.

1337
02:07:05,458 --> 02:07:06,869
Just so you know,

1338
02:07:08,966 --> 02:07:11,172
I never felt like a loser when I was with all of you.

1339
02:07:21,544 --> 02:07:22,987
See you around.

1340
02:08:10,663 --> 02:08:11,680
Bye.

1341
02:08:34,399 --> 02:08:38,354
IT
