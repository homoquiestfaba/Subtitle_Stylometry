1
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,321
War.

2
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:44,403
It's been a part of humanity
in every age.

3
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,009
We fight for power,

4
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,811
for riches,

5
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,287
for rights or for freedom.

6
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,566
There always seems to be
something to fight for.

7
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:01,485
But one thing has remained
true of every war.

8
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:07,810
Behind the field of battle,
someone has developed a strategy.

9
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,807
This was part of my husband's role
in the army.

10
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,880
He would look at what
the enemy was doing,

11
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,720
then begin putting together
the resources

12
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,611
and a plan to fight against them.

13
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,211
He was a crucial part of this process

14
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,000
until a heart attack claimed his life.

15
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,404
That was a hard time for me and our son.

16
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:43,605
I was reminded that death
is a part of life,

17
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:48,245
and that the life we're given
should never be taken for granted.

18
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,244
It's been 40 years since Leo passed,

19
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:00,767
but I still hold on to the many lessons
I learned from that time.

20
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:08,807
I find myself amazed that
of the many battles we engage in today,

21
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,126
be it money, control or matters
of the heart,

22
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:17,603
very few of us
know how to fight the right way,

23
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:22,001
or understand
who we're really fighting against.

24
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,609
To win any battle,

25
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:29,090
you've got to have
the right strategy and resources,

26
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:33,884
because victories
don't come by accident.

27
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,300
Hey, Mom, I gotta go. Yeah.

28
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,686
All right, okay. Bye.

29
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:01,130
Jason and David, get rid of the ball
and help me with these boxes!

30
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,220
I am so sorry.
You must be Elizabeth Jordan.

31
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,220
- I am. And you're Melissa?
- Yes.

32
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,846
I'm sorry. We just started packing.

33
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,740
No problem. Can I help you with that?

34
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:17,100
Honey. Honey, I gotta be
in Knoxville at 2:00.

35
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,363
But I finished the closet.
That was in the refrigerator.

36
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,128
- Real estate agent.
- Software rep.

37
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,260
How did you know that?

38
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,169
It's on that folder
you're holding in your hand.

39
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,020
I would love to stay.
I'm very sorry I have to leave.

40
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,140
My wife can answer everything
about the house.

41
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,660
We realize it's a disaster
and we've agreed to blame it on the kids.

42
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,762
- So, I'll call you later.
- Love you!

43
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:41,882
I understand. My husband does
the same thing. Pharmaceuticals.

44
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,449
Does he ever get tired of the travel?

45
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,921
No, I do not.

46
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,300
I enjoy the drive.

47
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,300
Well, we're excited to do business
with you, Tony.

48
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,940
- Hey, tell Coleman I said hello.
- I'll do it.

49
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,740
And thanks for the new driver.

50
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:55,980
Hey, you enjoy it, okay?

51
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,180
- I will.
- All right.

52
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,420
Good to see you.

53
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,727
Gentlemen, we'll be in touch.

54
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,771
I see you made the sale.

55
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,123
- Of course.
- I'm impressed.

56
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:13,211
Most guys run out
with their tail between their legs.

57
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,801
I'm Tony Jordan.

58
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,806
Veronica Drake. I work for Mr. Barnes.

59
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,045
I'll be your contact for the purchase.

60
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,100
Okay. Well, Veronica Drake,

61
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,567
I guess I'll be seeing you again
when I return in two weeks.

62
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,524
I look forward to it.

63
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,980
Mom?

64
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,491
I'm in here, Danielle.

65
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,082
Here's my last report card.

66
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,170
I still got one C.

67
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,540
Baby. You have an A in everything else.

68
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,820
One C in math is not that bad.

69
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,161
At least you get a break
for the summer, right?

70
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,620
Is that your feet?

71
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,722
I'm sorry, baby,
I ran out of foot powder.

72
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,540
That smells terrible!

73
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:05,611
I know, Danielle. I just needed
to take my shoes off for a minute.

74
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,801
That's, like, awful.

75
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,565
Well, don't just sit there
looking at them.

76
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,762
Why don't you give me a hand
and rub them right there?

77
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,761
No way.

78
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,980
Girl, go set the table for dinner.

79
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,540
When your daddy gets home,
you can show him your report card. Okay?

80
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,971
- Yes, ma'am.
- All right.

81
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,122
I just heard him pull in, Danielle.

82
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,083
Will he be mad about my C?

83
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:34,449
I already told you, baby,
a C is not that bad. It's okay.

84
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,700
Hey, Daddy.

85
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,926
Hey, Danielle.

86
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:44,500
I got my last report card.
I made all A's except for one C.

87
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,100
So, I just got a notification
that you moved $5,000

88
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,601
from our savings
into your checking account.

89
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:52,100
That better not be
so you can prop up your sister again.

90
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,646
You just gave that much money
to your family last month.

91
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,820
And my sister needs it
more than your parents do.

92
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,410
My parents are elderly. Okay?

93
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,620
Your sister married a bum,

94
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,580
and I'm not supporting someone
who's too lazy to work.

95
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,580
Darren is not a bum.

96
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,162
- He's just having a hard time finding a job.
- Liz, he is a bum.

97
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,251
Look, I can't even remember
the last time he had a job.

98
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,406
Can we talk about this later?

99
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,971
No, we'll talk about it now.

100
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,961
Because if you want to give them
what you make, that's fine.

101
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,700
- But you're not giving them my money.
- Your money?

102
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,500
The last time I checked,
we both put money into that account.

103
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:27,180
And the last time I checked,
I make four times what you do.

104
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,965
So you don't move a cent out
of that account without asking me first.

105
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,369
Can we please just eat dinner?

106
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,405
You know what? Go ahead.

107
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,525
I'm going to the gym.

108
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,210
Ballgame!

109
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,928
That was sick, man! That was sick.

110
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,928
- You all right, dog?
- Yeah. Why?

111
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,580
You look like you're playing
a little mad tonight.

112
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,489
So? You know that means I play better.

113
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,210
Better means ball hog?

114
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:39,489
Dude, I can't get a pass from you.
It'd be easier to baptize a cat.

115
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,020
I just needed to blow off
a little steam. Okay?

116
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,122
- Well, I hope you're done.
- I gotta go.

117
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:47,364
- Yo, yo, yo, you're coming to church, right?
- Maybe.

118
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,086
Maybe means no.

119
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,980
Hey, Tony, man. You gotta hit me one.

120
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,811
- Come on, man. I gotta go.
- Dude, I just told all these guys. Just one.

121
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,646
Watch this.

122
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,401
Told you!

123
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:05,645
The favor of God can't be bought,
traded or manipulated.

124
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,609
Because people still come to church

125
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,540
with their hearts
totally distant from the Lord.

126
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,860
But they think they could put on
their Sunday best,

127
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:16,487
and throw a super spiritual smile
on their face and impress God.

128
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:22,364
God is looking for people
who will seek him with a whole heart.

129
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:26,540
So it all comes down to this.
We either seek Him or we don't.

130
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,565
And God surely knows the difference
between the two, and so should we.

131
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,740
Danielle, I have to meet a client
in the morning,

132
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,220
so I'm going to drop you off early
at the community center, okay?

133
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,891
Okay. Can we pick up Jennifer
on the way?

134
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,380
Sure, if it's okay with her mother.

135
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,811
Who's Jennifer?

136
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,764
She's on my Double Dutch team.

137
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,326
I thought you were playing basketball.

138
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,500
I wanted to jump rope again.

139
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,060
Tony, you should go see her practice
tomorrow. She's really very good.

140
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,810
I'm out of town this week.

141
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,926
When were you gonna tell me?

142
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,246
I just did.

143
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,820
Tony, I know you're
the company's top salesman,

144
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,049
but in order for this family to function,
we have to communicate.

145
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,100
I thought you'd be here this week.

146
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,780
Well, if you want to continue to live
in this house, I have to make sales.

147
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,769
And that means being flexible.

148
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,131
Aren't you a little too old
to be jumping rope?

149
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,681
Here you go.

150
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:38,802
Now there's 5, 10, 15, 20.

151
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:42,290
And here's 5 extra
'cause I like your haircut.

152
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,500
Thank you, Ms. Williams.

153
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,060
I'm tired of seeing all these young boys
with sloppy hair

154
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,844
and pants around their knees.

155
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:52,140
- A man wears his pants around his waist.
- Yes, ma'am.

156
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,300
Well, tell your mama I said hello.
And I'll see you next week.

157
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,562
- Yes, ma'am. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

158
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,401
Ms. Williams?

159
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,801
That's me.

160
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,780
You must be Elizabeth.

161
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,740
Well, it's so good to meet you.

162
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,444
You can call me Clara.

163
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:10,131
Well, come on in.
Let me show you the house.

164
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,540
I got to put my coffee pot on.
Can I get you something?

165
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,642
No, thank you. I had mine at home.

166
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,444
This is a beautiful house.

167
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,405
I think so, too.

168
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,763
Built in 1905.

169
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,327
And I've lived here almost 50 years.

170
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:29,449
Leo added that sun porch on the back
all by himself.

171
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,330
This must be Leo.

172
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,247
That's Leo.

173
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,283
We were married
for 14 years before he died.

174
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,327
He had just been promoted to captain
before that picture was taken.

175
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:47,366
He was so handsome in that uniform.

176
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,130
He's fine, ain't he?

177
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:53,540
Yes, we wanted five or six children,

178
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:58,043
but the Lord only gave us Clyde,
'cause he was all I could handle.

179
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:01,060
You see that big crack
over there on the wall?

180
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,660
That was Clyde.

181
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:06,446
Now, this is my third favorite place.

182
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,171
It's my sitting room.

183
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,886
- What do you do in here?
- Mainly sit.

184
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:17,210
Well, come on in here.
Let me show you the dining room.

185
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:22,961
Now this is my second favorite place.

186
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,724
I love this room.

187
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,645
This is beautiful.

188
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,168
And I love this fireplace.

189
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,126
I've got a lot of good memories in here.

190
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,680
Yes, I do.

191
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,091
Lot of laughter.

192
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,489
And a few tears, too.

193
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:45,842
Now this is why I'm moving in with Clyde
a few blocks away.

194
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,684
It's getting harder
to negotiate these stairs.

195
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,020
Okay, so three bedrooms
and two full baths.

196
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,930
- Do you mind if I take some pictures?
- Go ahead, that's fine.

197
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:00,211
You got one of those smart phones.

198
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:03,060
I've been meaning
to get me one of those.

199
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:06,100
Can't do nothing with my phone
but call folks.

200
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,725
Must be a dumb phone.

201
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,444
- You got it?
- I do.

202
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,780
They say if you live in a house
with stairs, you'll live longer.

203
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:18,087
So I should make it to 180.

204
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,404
This is fascinating, Ms. Clara.

205
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,562
That's my Wall of Remembrance.

206
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,442
And when things aren't going so well,
I look back on it,

207
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:32,766
and I'm reminded that God
is still in control.

208
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,045
It encourages me.

209
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,042
I sure could use some of that.

210
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,220
I'm sorry.

211
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,220
Okay. So, I've got
a few questions about utilities,

212
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,140
and then we should probably talk
about the asking price.

213
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,287
All right.

214
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,300
Okay. So, I think I got everything
that I need for now.

215
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,925
So nice to meet you, Ms. Clara.

216
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,340
Listen, if you're available tomorrow,

217
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:55,140
I'd like to come by and show you
some comparisons in the area.

218
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:58,260
Well, why don't you come by for coffee
tomorrow morning

219
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,727
and we'll talk about it then? Say 10:00?

220
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,411
Okay. Yeah, I can do that.
I'll see you at 10:00.

221
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,921
By the way,
what's your most favorite room?

222
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,523
I'll tell you tomorrow.

223
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,129
Then I look forward to tomorrow.

224
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,841
How you doing?

225
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,580
- Mr. Jordan?
- Yes.

226
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:27,900
- Samples closet?
- Yes, please.

227
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,809
- Right this way.
- All right.

228
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:34,020
You can just use the third shelf down
and just leave the door open,

229
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,566
- and I'll come back and get it later.
- All right. Thank you.

230
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,220
You must be Mr. Jordan.

231
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,700
Dr. Morris, yes. I'm Tony Jordan,
Brightwell Pharmaceuticals.

232
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,881
We met last March.

233
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,260
- I remember. How are you?
- I'm doing fine.

234
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:03,420
I saw your write-up on new stimulants
and you showed interest in Predizim.

235
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,420
So I just left you a case
in your samples closet.

236
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,180
That's fantastic. I appreciate that.

237
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:11,171
It's no problem. You'll easily find them.
It's the third shelf, blue caps.

238
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:14,330
Now what I need you to do though,
is just sign this receipt.

239
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,700
And it just shows
that I left them with you.

240
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,060
Now, Dr. Morris, if you need any more,
you just let me know

241
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,540
and I'll be glad to bring some over.

242
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,060
Thank you, Tony. We'll try them out.

243
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,660
- All right. Sounds good. We'll see you again.
- Right.

244
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,205
And I'll be looking forward
to that next article.

245
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,651
Thank you.

246
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,561
And he thinks it's my sister's fault.
Can you even believe that?

247
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:36,170
Well, if my man said that to me,
I'd be angry, too.

248
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,100
We don't fight that much anymore.

249
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:41,140
After 31 years of stalemates, girl,
it just is not worth it.

250
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,620
I wouldn't put up with it.

251
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,246
His money became your money
the minute he said, "I do."

252
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,684
So I'd give it to my sister anyway.

253
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,530
I don't even like my sister.

254
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,700
Just be careful, Elizabeth.

255
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,723
You do not want World War III
to break out in your home.

256
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,725
No. No, I don't.

257
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:59,365
But there are days, Mandy.
There are days.

258
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,900
It's hard to submit to a man like that.

259
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,525
You know what my mama used to say to me?

260
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,540
She used to say that sometimes
submission is learning to duck

261
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,880
so God can hit your husband.

262
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,241
It's tough being a woman.

263
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,041
You got that right.

264
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:35,084
Veronica, this is Tony Jordan.

265
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:38,331
We met a few days ago
after I met with Mr. Barnes.

266
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,740
Hey, listen, I'll be coming
through town next week

267
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:44,049
and I was wondering if you could
recommend a couple of nice restaurants.

268
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,888
Feel free to call me back
at this number.

269
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,641
Take care.

270
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:58,047
I appreciate you coming this morning.

271
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,020
- Coffee will be ready in a couple of minutes.
- Sounds good.

272
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,060
I ran a sales report from the area.

273
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,130
I wrote down a suggested asking price
for the house.

274
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,930
Well, what do you think?

275
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,161
Now, what did you say
your husband did for a living?

276
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,780
Well, we actually
haven't talked about that,

277
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,963
but he's a sales rep
for Brightwell Pharmaceuticals.

278
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,650
And where did you say
you attended church?

279
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:32,604
Well, we occasionally attend
Riverdale Community.

280
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,890
So you would say you know the Lord.

281
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,323
Yes! I would say I know the Lord.

282
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,765
You think the Lord is okay
with this asking price?

283
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,969
And you have children?

284
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:51,340
Ms. Clara, my husband, Tony, and I
have been married for 16 years.

285
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,740
We have one daughter.
Her name is Danielle and she's 10.

286
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:58,162
She enjoys pop music and ice cream
and jumping rope.

287
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,528
Well, that's good to know.

288
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:05,729
Now, you say
you attend church occasionally.

289
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:09,580
Is that because your pastor
only preaches occasionally?

290
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:13,420
Ms. Clara, I really would like
to help you sell your house.

291
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,900
That's why I'm here.

292
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,740
As far as my faith is concerned,
I believe in God, just like most people.

293
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:21,047
He's very important to me.

294
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:24,243
Well, let me get our coffee.

295
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,681
So, if I asked you
what your prayer life was like,

296
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,609
would you say that it was hot or cold?

297
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,602
I don't know that I would say it's hot.

298
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:42,009
I mean, we're like most people.
We have full schedules. We work.

299
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,780
But I would consider myself
a spiritual person.

300
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:49,700
I'm not hot, but I'm not cold either.
Just, you know, somewhere in the middle.

301
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,211
Here you go.

302
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:56,207
- I've got cream or sugar if you need it.
- No, thank you. I like it black.

303
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,406
Ms. Clara, you like your coffee
room temperature?

304
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,649
No, baby, mine's hot.

305
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,287
Elizabeth,

306
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,248
people drink their coffee hot or cold,

307
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:20,207
but nobody likes it lukewarm,
not even the Lord.

308
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,380
Point taken, Ms. Clara.

309
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,980
But why do you feel the need
to examine my personal life?

310
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,765
Because I've been where you are.

311
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:31,762
And you don't have to step
on the same land mines that I did.

312
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,810
That's a waste of time.

313
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,484
And this asking price is just fine.

314
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,286
Let me get you a hot cup of coffee.

315
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:46,126
I was a little sneaky last time.

316
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,322
What land mines do you think
I might step on?

317
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,325
You tell me.

318
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:06,128
Now, if there was one thing in your life
that you could make better,

319
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,166
what would it be?

320
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,811
Just one?

321
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,180
Well, I'd probably have
to say my marriage.

322
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,965
If there's one thing
we do well, it's fight.

323
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,124
No, I don't think you do.

324
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,891
I'm sorry?

325
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:24,644
Just because you argue a lot
doesn't mean that you fight well.

326
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,641
Every couple has some friction
every now and then.

327
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:32,780
But I bet that you never
feel like you've won

328
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,451
after you've had an argument
with your husband.

329
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:42,051
Can I ask you how much
you pray for your husband?

330
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,446
Well, very little.

331
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,011
Elizabeth,

332
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:55,528
I think it's time for me to show you
my favorite place in this house.

333
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,846
Now, this is where I do my fighting.

334
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,366
A closet?

335
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,762
I call it my war room.

336
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:31,886
So...

337
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,728
So, you wrote prayers
for each area of your life?

338
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,241
A prayer strategy. Yes.

339
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,620
Now, I used to do
what you and your husband are doing,

340
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,700
but it got me nowhere.

341
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:46,900
And then I really started studying
what the scriptures say.

342
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,642
And God showed me that it wasn't my job
to do the heavy lifting. No.

343
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,924
That was something
that only He could do.

344
00:21:55,320 --> 00:22:00,326
It was my job to seek Him, to trust Him
and to stand on His word.

345
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,820
Ms. Clara, I've never seen
anything like this.

346
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:07,571
And I admire it, I really do. I just...

347
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,340
I don't have time to pray
that much every day.

348
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:14,411
But you apparently have time
to fight losing battles with your husband.

349
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,446
Elizabeth,

350
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:21,760
if you will give me one hour a week,

351
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:27,406
I can teach you how to fight
the right way with the right weapons.

352
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:34,580
Since you're good with the asking price,
I'll go ahead and list the house.

353
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:38,127
I'd like to think about
our other discussion.

354
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:43,524
Elizabeth, please forgive me
for being so direct,

355
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:46,890
but I see in you a warrior

356
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,128
that needs to be awakened.

357
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:53,940
But I will respect
whatever decision you make.

358
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,441
Thank you, Ms. Clara.
I hope you have a good day.

359
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,641
You, too.

360
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,900
Don't let me push too hard, Lord.

361
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,480
I know I got a big mouth.

362
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,900
If they do that stunt
in the competition, they'll win.

363
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,860
Why don't you ask your dad
about helping us get uniforms?

364
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,962
He's not here.
It's not like he would care anyway.

365
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,766
Can you ask your mom?
My mom already gave part of the money.

366
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,923
Come on, we can go to my room.

367
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:52,526
So, I told my dad that he could jump with us,
and he totally started laughing.

368
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:55,300
He said he would only do it
if Mom did it with him,

369
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,580
which, of course, she would never do.

370
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:01,420
So, they, like, start talking
about doing the worst routine ever.

371
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,851
Like, in a funny way.

372
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,940
And she starts laughing so hard,
her face turned bright red.

373
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:08,725
Then she starts squeaking
'cause she couldn't breathe.

374
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,524
It was hilarious.

375
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,604
I wish I lived at your house.

376
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,724
Whenever my parents are together,
they just fight.

377
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,010
Jennifer, how's your family?

378
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,727
Fine.

379
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,360
Would you like to stay for dinner?
You're welcome to eat with us.

380
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,047
Okay.

381
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:34,009
Okay, well, I'm gonna go change.

382
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:37,048
I'll call you girls down
in a few minutes.

383
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,446
Danielle...

384
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,442
You know we love you, right?

385
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,803
That wasn't very convincing.

386
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:46,285
Well, I think you love me a little bit.

387
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,120
A little bit?

388
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,804
Danielle, you're my daughter.

389
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:53,420
You're the most important thing
in the whole world to me.

390
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,931
You gotta believe that.

391
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,325
What's my team name?

392
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,171
The Firecrackers.

393
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,290
That was last year.

394
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,165
What are our colors?

395
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,925
What jump rope tricks
did I just learn to do?

396
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,770
Who's my new coach?

397
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,567
What award did I win
last week on my team?

398
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,682
You won an award last week?

399
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,689
Danielle, I'm so sorry.

400
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,570
I'm so sorry.

401
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,364
I'm so sorry.

402
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:57,441
I'm sorry.

403
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,929
Well, good morning.

404
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:15,060
Her heart is just breaking
and I was completely unaware.

405
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:17,891
Tony, he's completely unaware.

406
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:20,020
That man is running
out of time, Ms. Clara.

407
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:22,700
He's off in his own world
being top salesman somewhere

408
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:25,620
while his daughter is growing
more and more calloused to him every day.

409
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:28,740
He shows no interest
in anybody but himself.

410
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,700
And another thing.
I don't have proof of this,

411
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:33,980
but if he's not getting it from me,
he's got to be getting it from somebody.

412
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,820
He makes all these little flirtatious
comments to other women...

413
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:39,526
Elizabeth, just so I know,

414
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:43,562
how much of the one hour
we got together today

415
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:46,331
are you gonna spend
whining about your husband?

416
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:49,940
And how much we gonna spend
on what the Lord can do about it?

417
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:54,284
I'm sorry, Ms. Clara. I just get so wound up
the more I think about it.

418
00:27:54,720 --> 00:28:00,060
Your thoughts about your husband
are almost entirely negative, aren't they?

419
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,924
He acts like an enemy to me.

420
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:05,330
See, you're fighting the wrong enemy.

421
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:09,731
Now, your husband certainly has
his issues, but he's not your enemy.

422
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,200
When I fought against my husband,

423
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:17,611
I was fighting against my own marriage
and my family.

424
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:22,363
Now, I tried for years to fix Leo,
but I couldn't do it.

425
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,523
Well, I haven't got anywhere with Tony.

426
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,928
'Cause it's not your job.

427
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:31,530
Who said that it was your responsibility
to fix Tony?

428
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:36,648
It's your job to love him, to respect him
and to pray for the man.

429
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,962
God knows he needs it.

430
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:43,240
And men don't like it when
their woman's always trying to fix them.

431
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,326
Elizabeth,

432
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:51,167
you got to plead with God
so that He can do what only He can do.

433
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:55,167
And then you got to get out of the way
and let Him do it!

434
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,489
I don't even know where to start.

435
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,126
Here.

436
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:05,451
You will find some
of my favorite scriptures in here.

437
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:09,203
They were my battle plan
to pray for my family.

438
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,205
You can start with that.

439
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,127
Mom?

440
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,686
I'm in here, Danielle.

441
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,209
Mom, are you okay?

442
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,804
Yes. What do you need?

443
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:37,930
Why are you eating chips in the closet?

444
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:41,447
I'm just having some private time. Okay?

445
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:43,927
Okay.

446
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:47,620
Jennifer wanted to know
if I could spend the night.

447
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:50,963
I already did my chores,
and it's okay with her parents.

448
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,340
Okay, but I want you home
by lunch tomorrow. Okay?

449
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:57,125
- Yes, ma'am.
- And, Danielle,

450
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:02,521
don't tell anybody
I was eating chips in this closet.

451
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:06,682
Don't tell anyone my mom
was eating chips in the closet, okay?

452
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:09,485
- Who are you talking to?
- Jennifer.

453
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,440
Jennifer?

454
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:16,446
Yes, ma'am?

455
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:22,124
I'm asking you not to tell anybody
I was eating chips in my closet.

456
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:25,731
- Okay.
- Thank you.

457
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,804
What's that smell?

458
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,660
That would be my shoes, Jennifer.

459
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:36,321
And if you girls would kindly shut the door,
you won't have to smell it anymore.

460
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,900
Is she not allowed to eat chips?

461
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,163
I can have all the chips I want!
This is my house!

462
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,321
Great.

463
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,250
Hello, Tony. How are you?

464
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,900
- Julia, how're you doing?
- I'm doing well, thanks.

465
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,300
- Having a good day?
- I am, thank you.

466
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:12,540
Coleman's expecting you
and Tom's in there, too.

467
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,420
- Thanks for the heads up.
- You're welcome. Right this way.

468
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:16,726
All right, thank you.

469
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:24,580
- Tony! How's my favorite rep?
- Real good. How're you doing?

470
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,540
- Heard we got the Holcombe account.
- Yes, we did.

471
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,780
- That's fantastic. You did it again.
- Appreciate that. Thank you.

472
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:32,420
Even Tom was impressed,
and you know that's hard to do.

473
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,060
- Good work.
- Thank you.

474
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:37,420
Look, I know you're on your way home,
but we just wanted to say thanks.

475
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,488
And you got a nice bonus check
coming your way.

476
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,140
- I like that.
- Yeah, you do.

477
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,860
- How's Elizabeth?
- She's good.

478
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,180
- Tell her I said hello.
- I'll do it.

479
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,850
- Good to see you.
- All right.

480
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:57,100
Cynthia, it's not gonna do you any good
to fight about it.

481
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,300
You can't get the job for him.

482
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,020
Well, is he trying at all?

483
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:04,044
Is he sending out resumes
or making calls, anything?

484
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,081
I know.

485
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:12,888
Well, I'm sorry, but he's making it hard,
not just on you but everybody around you.

486
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:17,722
No, I'm not saying that we're not gonna help.
We're still talking about it. Okay?

487
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,961
Listen, Tony just got home.
I need to call you later.

488
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:25,969
Yeah. I love you, too. Bye.

489
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,889
- How was your trip?
- It was good.

490
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,081
- I take it that was your sister.
- Yep.

491
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,729
Darren getting a job?

492
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,561
Not yet.

493
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,660
Not yet as in he's trying?

494
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:43,620
Or not yet as in he's still sitting
on the couch playing video games?

495
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,768
Tony, what he does
is not Cynthia's fault.

496
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,860
Listen, she just needs one month's rent
and a car payment.

497
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,460
I think we should at least do that.

498
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:52,220
Cynthia married a loser. Okay?

499
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,260
That was her choice
when everybody told her not to.

500
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:57,330
- It is her fault.
- Tony, she cannot control him.

501
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,802
She's got a job, but it's not enough.

502
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,700
Listen, I'm not asking
for $5,000 anymore.

503
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:05,460
I'm asking for one month's rent
and a car payment.

504
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:08,100
And the next month you'll be asking
for the same thing, Liz.

505
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,804
So the answer is still no.

506
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:12,363
And what is that smell in here?

507
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,930
I'm putting powder in my shoes.

508
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:19,411
- Well, can't you do that outside?
- Yes.

509
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:26,162
Tony, if you won't do it for her,

510
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:28,241
do it for me.

511
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:33,887
No.

512
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,885
- You got another bonus?
- Yes, sir.

513
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:16,202
Dude, I went in the wrong line of work.

514
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:20,968
Well, I couldn't have been a paramedic.

515
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:25,690
- You got that right, bro.
- And you too calm to be a salesman.

516
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:29,540
Yeah. Yeah, but could you imagine

517
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:32,405
if I got bonuses
every time I saved somebody's life?

518
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:36,460
Check it out. Heimlich, $200.

519
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:39,740
Right? CPR, $400.

520
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:40,887
Right.

521
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:44,006
Like $1,000, if they're ugly.

522
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:47,620
Dude, you remember that one lady who had
swallowed that garlic and she choked,

523
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,700
and I had to give her mouth-to-mouth?

524
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:52,326
- Yeah.
- That should've been a Hawaiian vacation.

525
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:55,260
- I couldn't have done it.
- Yeah. You could do it.

526
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:58,887
You're not gonna let somebody die
in front of you while you eat your salad.

527
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:04,000
I don't do CPR, Mike.
I'd have just called 911.

528
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:07,409
That's just cold.
You just gonna let somebody die?

529
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,524
What if it was your wife?

530
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,885
Hold on, brother. What? What's that?

531
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:19,084
- What is that?
- What's what?

532
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:21,089
Dude, what's up with you and Liz?

533
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,001
Nothing.

534
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,940
Nothing?
Look at you getting all uptight.

535
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:27,441
You got extra veins popping out
that wasn't even there before.

536
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:31,842
Mike, I'm just tired of her. Okay?
All right? I said it.

537
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:35,047
- I'm just tired of her junk.
- Her junk?

538
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,500
Dude, you married her, junk and all.

539
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:41,860
It's not some sort of buffet where you
get to pick and choose what you want.

540
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,450
You get all of her, bro.

541
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:47,411
And you better not have somebody
on the side.

542
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:50,686
So, you're trying to do CPR
on my personal life now?

543
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,740
Okay. Yeah, I'm a paramedic.
But I'm also a Christian,

544
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:58,049
which means I help people
while I'm helping people.

545
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:02,020
Mike, look, we've been friends
for a long time,

546
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:04,460
but some things
are just none of your business.

547
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,900
True, and since we've been friends
a long time,

548
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,260
I'm not just gonna
watch your marriage die.

549
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:12,648
So if it's bleeding,
I'm not gonna keep eating my salad.

550
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,251
I'll see you in church.

551
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,082
I'd like to see the church in you, bro.

552
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,767
Hey, somebody need to come move this.

553
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:44,889
This was a treat for me, Elizabeth.

554
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:50,286
I enjoy coming here.
And your daughter is precious.

555
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,167
She is.

556
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:56,650
You know, there are days
I wish she had a brother or sister.

557
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:59,481
We were just too busy
chasing our careers.

558
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,940
I don't know that that was
a wise thing to do.

559
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,042
You don't enjoy your job?

560
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:08,926
There are days I do. Sold a house
this morning, so that was good.

561
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,407
I'd just rather have a good marriage
than more money.

562
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,940
Mom! Can we go get ice cream?

563
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,963
They sell it right over there.

564
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,884
Ms. Clara, would you like
some ice cream?

565
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,085
I'll tell you what.

566
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:27,980
If you go get the ice cream
and let your mother walk me to the car,

567
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:30,860
- I'll pay for it.
- Oh, no, no, no. I'm paying for it.

568
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:35,260
And rob me of a blessing?
I'm paying, we're all eating.

569
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:39,206
And I'll take two scoops
of Butter Pecan, please. In a cup.

570
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:42,020
I'll have one scoop
of Cookies and Cream, okay?

571
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,140
And listen, just stay right there,

572
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:45,580
'cause we're gonna pull the car around
and pick you up at the entrance.

573
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:49,287
Okay. Can I have strawberry sherbet with
gummy worms and chocolate syrup on top?

574
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:53,660
So, what does a normal week
in your life look like?

575
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:57,140
Well, my son drops in for an hour or two
during the week.

576
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:00,289
I go grocery shopping,
an occasional doctor's visit,

577
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:05,020
and my girlfriends and I get together
on Friday afternoons for coffee.

578
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:09,380
Other than that, I read a lot
and I spend time with Jesus.

579
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,926
I used to spend so much time
with my girlfriends before my job...

580
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,700
Give me your money right now.

581
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,380
Did you hear me?
Both of you, give it to me now.

582
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,260
Okay. Okay, we will.
Just please, put the knife down.

583
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:19,646
Do it, and do it now!

584
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:21,660
No.

585
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:27,051
Now you put that knife down right now
in the name of Jesus.

586
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,169
And you believe he was early 20s?

587
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:39,129
Yeah. Maybe 25.

588
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,730
So, let me get this straight.

589
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,500
He was pointing a knife at you

590
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:48,207
and you told him to put it down
in Jesus' name?

591
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:52,220
Right. Now when you write that down,
don't leave out Jesus.

592
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,780
People always leaving Jesus out.

593
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,531
That's one of the reasons
we're in the mess we in.

594
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,420
Yes, ma'am.

595
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:05,540
You know, what concerns me
is that you could've easily been killed.

596
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:09,940
Well, I know a lot of people probably
would've given him their money.

597
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:13,010
I understand that,
but that's their decision.

598
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:19,020
Are you not eating
your ice cream, Elizabeth?

599
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:20,580
No. I'm not hungry anymore.

600
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:25,527
Well, let me help you with that.
No reason to waste perfectly good ice cream.

601
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,129
Now that's good!

602
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:43,250
I'm sorry, I just thought
I should call Tony.

603
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:44,900
I understand.

604
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,580
You'd think he'd be more alarmed.

605
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:48,380
He just kept saying
that since we were all okay,

606
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,580
I should just calm down.

607
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:52,260
I'm having trouble calming down myself.

608
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:54,140
Really? You seemed calm earlier.

609
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:57,740
Yeah, but I got a huge sugar-rush
from all that ice cream.

610
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:01,686
I feel like I can run around
the block a few times.

611
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:07,460
While we on the subject of Tony,
I have something for you to do.

612
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:08,580
What's that?

613
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:13,447
I want you to write down everything
that you can think of that he's done wrong.

614
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,940
Ms. Clara, if I did that,
I'd be writing a long time.

615
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,180
Well, then just write
down the highlights.

616
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:21,886
And I'll be back to check on you
in a little while.

617
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:39,020
Well, that's almost three pages.

618
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:41,980
And I could write more, but you'll get
the gist of it when you read it.

619
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:44,287
Actually, I'm not gonna read it.

620
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:48,120
My question to you is this.

621
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:53,931
In light of all these wrongs,
does God still love Tony?

622
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,925
We both know he does.

623
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:59,400
Do you?

624
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,762
Now, Ms. Clara, you're meddling.

625
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:10,207
There's love in my heart for Tony,
but it's just buried under a lot of frustration.

626
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:13,170
- So he needs grace.
- Grace?

627
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,260
I don't know that he deserves grace.

628
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:17,124
Do you deserve grace?

629
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:22,300
Ms. Clara, you have a habit of backing me up
in a corner and making me squirm.

630
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,164
I felt the same way.

631
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:29,204
But the question still remains.
Do you deserve grace?

632
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:34,809
The Bible says that no one is righteous,
not even one.

633
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:40,610
For we have all sinned.
So, really, none of us deserve grace.

634
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:44,688
But we all still want God's forgiveness.

635
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:48,608
Elizabeth, it comes down to this.

636
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:52,540
Jesus shed his blood on the cross.

637
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:57,820
He died for you.
Even when you did not deserve it.

638
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:02,060
And He rose from the grave
and offers forgiveness and salvation

639
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:05,323
for anyone who turns to Him.

640
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:08,408
But the Bible also says

641
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:13,162
that we can't ask Him to forgive us
while refusing to forgive others.

642
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:16,900
I know, Ms. Clara.
But that's just so hard to do.

643
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,580
Yes, it is. Yes, it is.

644
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:22,206
But that's where grace comes in!

645
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:24,682
He gives us grace!

646
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:29,564
And He helps us to give it to others,
even when they don't deserve it.

647
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:33,140
We all deserve judgment.

648
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:40,044
And that is what a holy God gives us
when we don't repent and believe in His Son.

649
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:47,568
I had to forgive Leo for some things,
and it wasn't easy.

650
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:49,370
But it freed me.

651
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:55,980
Elizabeth, there's not room for you
and God on the throne of your heart.

652
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:59,766
It's either Him or it's you.
You need to step down.

653
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:05,366
Now, if you want victory,
you're gonna have to first surrender.

654
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:07,171
But, Ms. Clara,

655
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:12,620
do I just back off and choose to forgive
and then just let him walk all over me?

656
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:17,886
God is a good defense attorney.
Trust it to Him.

657
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:22,020
And then you can turn your focus
to the real enemy.

658
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:23,500
The real enemy?

659
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:25,820
The one that wants to remain hidden.

660
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:28,060
The one that wants to distract you

661
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:33,371
and deceive you and divide you
from the Lord and your husband!

662
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:35,448
You see, that's how he works.

663
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:40,980
Satan comes to steal, kill and destroy.

664
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:43,660
And he is stealing your joy.

665
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:48,846
He is killing your faith
and he's trying to destroy your family.

666
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:54,123
If I were you,
I would get my heart right with God.

667
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:58,685
And you need to do
your fighting in prayer!

668
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:04,888
And you need to kick the real enemy
out of your home with the word of God.

669
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:08,286
It's time for you to fight, Elizabeth.

670
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:11,620
It's time for you to fight
for your marriage!

671
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:14,500
It's time for you to fight
the real enemy!

672
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:18,525
It's time for you
to take off the gloves and do it!

673
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,060
There's no magic
in the location you pray.

674
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:47,530
But scripture does say to go
into your inner room and pray in secret.

675
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:53,204
And your heavenly Father, who sees
what's done in secret, will reward you.

676
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:59,370
Now get rid of any distractions
and focus your heart and mind on Him.

677
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:04,170
Acknowledge that He is God,
and that you desperately need Him.

678
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:11,240
Now, be grateful for your blessings,
but lift your needs and requests to Him.

679
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:15,180
If you've got something to confess,
then confess it.

680
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:18,860
Ask Him for forgiveness.
Then choose to believe Him

681
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:22,420
when He says that He loves you
and will take care of you.

682
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:25,780
Then pray for the heart of your husband,

683
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:30,283
your daughter and anyone else
that the Lord brings to your mind.

684
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:32,444
And don't rush it.

685
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:37,043
You take your time, and then you listen.

686
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:45,411
God...

687
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:50,089
God, I need you.

688
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:56,727
I know I haven't prayed like I should.

689
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:03,851
I know that I haven't...
I haven't followed you like I should.

690
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:07,521
But I need you, right now.

691
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:14,961
Lord, I've been so angry at Tony,

692
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:19,327
and I'm still so angry at him.

693
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:25,687
But I don't want to lose my marriage.

694
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:33,089
Lord, forgive me.

695
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:36,286
Forgive me.

696
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:39,522
I'm not his judge, you are.

697
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,446
But I'm asking you, please,

698
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:48,445
please don't let him do this.

699
00:48:57,920 --> 00:48:59,046
Take over.

700
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:02,970
Please, take over.

701
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:11,048
Take my heart and take all this anger.

702
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:15,769
Help him love me again.

703
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:21,409
And help me love him.

704
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:30,689
If he's doing something wrong,
don't let him get away with it.

705
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:35,607
Stand in his way.

706
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:38,648
I'm asking you, please,

707
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:41,885
to help me.

708
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:04,567
"The thief comes only to steal

709
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:07,527
"to kill and destroy.

710
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:13,445
"But I've come that you may have a life,
and have it abundantly."

711
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,529
"But the Lord is faithful.

712
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:24,563
"He will strengthen
and protect you from the evil one.

713
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:31,208
"Submit to God.

714
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:34,609
"Resist the devil,

715
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:38,883
"and he will flee."

716
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,525
"Submit to God.

717
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:54,444
"Resist the devil, and he will flee."

718
00:50:57,840 --> 00:50:59,490
"Submit to God.

719
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:04,490
"Resist the devil,

720
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:09,323
"and he will flee."

721
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:44,241
I don't know where you are, Devil,

722
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:47,242
but I know you can hear me.

723
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:52,331
You have played with my mind

724
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:55,482
and had your way long enough.

725
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:00,170
No more.

726
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:03,284
You are done!

727
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:15,204
Jesus is the Lord of this house.

728
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:19,964
And that means there's no place
for you here anymore.

729
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:27,920
So take your lies, your schemes
and your accusations,

730
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:31,886
and get out in Jesus' name!

731
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:43,500
You can't have my marriage.

732
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:45,660
You can't have my daughter.

733
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:48,140
And you sure can't have my man.

734
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:53,201
This house is under new management
and that means you are out!

735
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:05,500
And another thing.

736
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:10,300
I am so sick of you stealing my joy,
but that's changing, too.

737
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:12,660
My joy doesn't come from my friends.

738
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:14,842
It doesn't come from my job.

739
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:17,340
It doesn't even come from my husband.

740
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:19,920
My joy is found in Jesus.

741
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:24,286
And just in case you forgot,
he has already defeated you.

742
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:30,366
So go back to Hell where you belong
and leave my family alone.

743
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:50,482
You know what I'd really like right now?

744
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:51,801
Tell me.

745
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:54,608
A glass of my favorite wine.

746
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:57,766
Okay, we can do that. What is it?

747
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:00,330
It's not here.

748
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:02,485
It's at my apartment.

749
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:07,243
Well, if it's your favorite,
I'd like to try it.

750
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:11,300
Here you are, sir.
Hope you both have a wonderful evening.

751
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:13,687
Thank you. We will.

752
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:26,527
Veronica, listen.

753
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:31,361
I need a minute. All right?
I'll be right back.

754
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:33,841
Okay.

755
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:53,361
Mom?

756
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,140
Danielle?

757
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:21,368
What happened to your closet?

758
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:38,250
I'm doing something
I should've done a long time ago.

759
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:41,689
I'm learning how to pray

760
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:44,486
and fight

761
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:46,646
and trust.

762
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:49,660
By cleaning out your closet?

763
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:52,180
No. Well, yes. But no.

764
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:55,409
I mean, it needed to be cleaned out.

765
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:58,606
But that's not why I did it. I did it...

766
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:01,370
I did it to fight in prayer.

767
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:03,660
You're fighting God?

768
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:05,340
No, I'm not...

769
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:08,140
Well, sometimes I do fight God.

770
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:11,483
But I shouldn't 'cause He always wins.

771
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:16,180
So, you know, I'm praying
for God to fight for me

772
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:18,123
'cause I am just sick of losing.

773
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:21,420
But not against God.
I need to lose against God.

774
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:24,980
I'm sick of losing in other areas
where I'm just fighting

775
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:27,686
but I just keep losing all the time.

776
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:30,001
It's exhausting.

777
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:34,700
So I'm learning how not to fight God

778
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:37,963
and how to let Him fight for me
so that we can all win.

779
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:39,811
Does that make any sense?

780
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:41,486
No.

781
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:46,849
You know what?
I don't make much sense when I'm tired.

782
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:49,004
You must be really tired.

783
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:53,220
Let's just go get a late night snack.
Okay? And I'll try it again.

784
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:54,651
Okay.

785
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:43,364
Now see, you're already influencing
your daughter.

786
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:45,900
This can change everything for her.

787
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:50,460
I admit, when I first started praying in there,
10 minutes seemed like an eternity.

788
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:52,847
Now I have a hard time
even wanting to leave.

789
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:30,281
Hello.

790
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:34,762
I just need you to sign
for this package.

791
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:38,845
Thank you so much.

792
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:42,740
This is a present for my daughter.
I can't wait to give it to her.

793
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:45,650
Well, I hope it takes your breath away.

794
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:50,764
Have a nice day, ma'am.

795
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:02,300
- I like it. And you got one, too?
- Yep, I sure did.

796
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:05,220
And you can write your prayer requests
in there, your favorite verses.

797
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:08,369
- We can journal, anything we want.
- Hey, Daddy.

798
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:09,620
- Hey, Danielle.
- Hey.

799
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:11,700
I didn't think you were coming home
till tonight.

800
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:15,043
Yeah. I finished up everything
pretty early, so...

801
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:18,723
- You got enough for me?
- Sure.

802
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:21,087
Jennifer's mom is coming
to pick Danielle up in a few minutes,

803
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:23,441
- but you and I can eat.
- All right.

804
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:26,481
- I'll take my stuff to the room.
- All right.

805
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:42,220
- Hey, how are you?
- I'm good. How are you?

806
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:43,820
You and the girls hanging out today?

807
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:45,740
Yeah. We're gonna go to the park
for a couple hours,

808
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:49,606
and then I thought we could grab
a milkshake at Chick-fil-A's, if that's okay?

809
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:13,940
So, what's been going on here?

810
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:16,060
Well, I sold another house on Tuesday.

811
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:18,208
And I already told you
about getting held up, so...

812
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:20,169
Yeah, look, about that.

813
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:23,443
It's not that I didn't care.

814
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:27,020
I just got really busy,

815
01:00:27,120 --> 01:00:28,660
so when I saw
that you were all right...

816
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:32,287
I understand. It's all right.
I'm sorry for getting so worked up about it.

817
01:00:32,560 --> 01:00:33,580
You're sorry?

818
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:37,100
Yeah. I knew you were at work,
probably in a meeting.

819
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:39,780
I should've just waited
till later to bring it up.

820
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:42,780
My mind was just racing,
so I took it out on you.

821
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:45,740
But you know what?
I really think it was good for Danielle.

822
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:49,811
I think it helped her to realize how important
it is to be aware of who's around you, so...

823
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:52,251
You want hot sauce?

824
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:56,090
- Yeah, that's fine.
- You want mild or Wrath of God?

825
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:58,687
I don't want Wrath of God.
Let me have the other one.

826
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:14,730
What do you want, Liz?

827
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:19,446
- You mean, right now?
- Yeah.

828
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:24,330
Well, I would kill for

829
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:26,930
a hot fudge sundae.

830
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:28,886
Just

831
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:31,926
fudge everywhere.

832
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:35,240
And two scoops of ice cream,
Cookies and Cream.

833
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:40,726
Whipped cream. Just mounds,
mounds of whipped cream on top.

834
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:45,328
And one cherry. One cherry.

835
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:49,483
And my feet are killing me.

836
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:51,329
Man, I would love a foot rub.

837
01:01:56,920 --> 01:01:58,843
Liz, I'm not rubbing your feet.

838
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:00,966
Okay.

839
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:03,490
Well, you wanna pray?

840
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:05,966
Yeah.

841
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:09,969
God, we thank you for this food.

842
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:13,127
And we thank you
for taking care of our family.

843
01:02:14,320 --> 01:02:16,380
- Amen.
- Amen.

844
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:18,323
I'm starving. Let's eat.

845
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:24,687
It's good.

846
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:30,940
And you double checked your numbers.

847
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:34,060
Twice. Tony's inventory is off, Rick.

848
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:37,164
We saw the same thing last week
when he left Asheville.

849
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:41,003
He may just be padding numbers,
but there's a pattern here.

850
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:44,900
You're the district manager.
You gotta call this in.

851
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:48,846
- Yeah. Thanks, Greg.
- Sorry, man. Later.

852
01:02:59,240 --> 01:03:00,321
Why, Tony?

853
01:03:10,080 --> 01:03:11,900
Hey, Danielle. Where's Daddy?

854
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,970
He left. He got a call
from his boss and had to go.

855
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:17,644
- From Rick?
- I think so.

856
01:03:18,520 --> 01:03:20,966
- Did he say when he'd be back?
- No, ma'am.

857
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:25,325
I hear him.

858
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:55,686
Hey.

859
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:04,820
Tony?

860
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:07,260
First off,
I don't want any grief from you. Okay?

861
01:04:07,360 --> 01:04:09,931
'Cause I'm really not in the mood
to talk about this right now.

862
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:15,884
Tony, what's going on?

863
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:19,531
I just lost my job!

864
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:31,331
Okay. So, we'll just do
what we gotta do.

865
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:33,802
What, no sarcastic comment?

866
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:38,285
Tony, I think we'll be fine.

867
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:41,725
Liz, you heard me, right?
I just got fired!

868
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:46,980
Okay? So that means no income.
No company car. No health coverage.

869
01:04:47,080 --> 01:04:49,003
We can't even afford this house anymore.

870
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:54,420
I understand.

871
01:04:54,520 --> 01:04:58,570
Listen, I'll just pick up some new properties
while you look for a different job. Okay?

872
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:03,766
So, that's it?

873
01:05:05,320 --> 01:05:06,845
You just gonna roll with it?

874
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:10,609
What else am I supposed to do?

875
01:05:13,320 --> 01:05:15,243
Sometimes I don't get you, Liz.

876
01:05:18,560 --> 01:05:20,005
I'll go start dinner.

877
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:35,681
Tony!

878
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:38,961
Please help me! Please!

879
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:40,886
Tony!

880
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:43,683
Tony, help me, please!

881
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:47,961
Tony!

882
01:05:49,160 --> 01:05:51,322
Tony, no! No!

883
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:25,651
Danielle, have you seen my gym bag?

884
01:06:26,560 --> 01:06:27,641
No, sir.

885
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:07,606
"Lord, I pray for Tony,
that you would turn his heart back to you.

886
01:07:08,120 --> 01:07:12,460
"Help me to love him,
and give him a fresh love for me.

887
01:07:12,560 --> 01:07:14,980
"I surrender my rights to you as Lord

888
01:07:15,080 --> 01:07:20,740
"and ask you to bless him as he honors you
and to expose him if he walks in deceit.

889
01:07:20,840 --> 01:07:24,260
"Build him up as the man
you intend him to be.

890
01:07:24,360 --> 01:07:29,127
"Help me to support and respect him.
I ask for your help to love him.

891
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:31,700
"In Jesus' name I pray."

892
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:32,926
Daddy?

893
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:36,980
I found your gym bag
next to the washing machine.

894
01:07:37,080 --> 01:07:39,651
Okay. You can just set it
right there, Danielle.

895
01:07:42,760 --> 01:07:44,091
Hey, Danielle.

896
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:49,048
When did Mama do this to her closet?

897
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:51,970
A few weeks ago.

898
01:07:58,320 --> 01:08:02,211
- So, the whole closet was empty?
- Yeah, except the papers on the wall.

899
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:05,120
And what did she do with her clothes?

900
01:08:05,480 --> 01:08:09,060
Mike, I don't know, man. Some other closet.
What does that matter?

901
01:08:09,160 --> 01:08:11,740
Dude, I don't think you understand
how important this is.

902
01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:15,401
When was the last time you heard
of a woman giving up some closet space?

903
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:21,084
All I know is, you can fight against
your wife and probably hold your own.

904
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:22,440
But if God is fighting for her,

905
01:08:23,840 --> 01:08:25,569
you can hit the gym
all you want to, bro.

906
01:08:26,680 --> 01:08:28,170
It's not looking good for you.

907
01:08:29,560 --> 01:08:30,607
Man!

908
01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:33,482
I wish my wife would pray
for me like that.

909
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:38,051
Plus, I could use the closet space.

910
01:08:40,280 --> 01:08:42,940
All right, man, you good, yo.
I'm about to bounce.

911
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:44,087
- See you later, bro.
- All right.

912
01:08:51,880 --> 01:08:52,881
Excuse me.

913
01:08:53,320 --> 01:08:55,540
Can you tell Danielle
I'll be back to get her after practice?

914
01:08:55,640 --> 01:08:56,820
- Sure, I'll tell her.
- All right.

915
01:08:56,920 --> 01:08:58,251
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

916
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:50,966
Tony! Please help me! Please!

917
01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:40,766
Jesus,

918
01:10:44,280 --> 01:10:45,884
I'm not a good man.

919
01:10:55,680 --> 01:10:57,011
I'm selfish.

920
01:11:01,240 --> 01:11:02,685
I'm prideful.

921
01:11:08,520 --> 01:11:10,488
And I'm hurting this family.

922
01:11:12,360 --> 01:11:14,966
But this, this is not
who I wanted to be.

923
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:19,488
I don't like the man I've become,

924
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:24,528
but I don't know how to fix it.

925
01:11:27,320 --> 01:11:28,970
I don't know what to do.

926
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:36,163
Forgive me, please.

927
01:11:44,440 --> 01:11:46,044
Forgive me, Jesus.

928
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:09,460
One, two, three, go.

929
01:12:09,560 --> 01:12:11,324
Left, left, right.

930
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:14,804
Left, left, right.

931
01:12:18,280 --> 01:12:19,361
Yes! Go!

932
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:28,164
One, two, three.

933
01:12:28,600 --> 01:12:30,090
Left, left, right.

934
01:12:33,320 --> 01:12:34,401
Hey, you know what?

935
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:39,210
I thought your jump roping routine
was gonna be something simple.

936
01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:42,608
But it wasn't. It's pretty difficult.

937
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:47,882
But you were really good, Danielle.
I mean, I was impressed.

938
01:12:49,680 --> 01:12:51,045
You're really good.

939
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:53,126
Thanks.

940
01:13:03,080 --> 01:13:04,923
Daddy, why are they here?

941
01:13:05,640 --> 01:13:07,802
They've come to get this car, Danielle.

942
01:13:14,440 --> 01:13:15,646
Excuse me.

943
01:13:21,680 --> 01:13:23,011
- Rick.
- Tony.

944
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:24,806
I'm sorry about this.

945
01:13:25,320 --> 01:13:26,481
It's not your fault, Rick.

946
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,526
Listen, I need you to sign
that we came for the car.

947
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:31,445
And clean out any items
that belong to you.

948
01:13:32,120 --> 01:13:33,167
Yep.

949
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:35,286
Already did.

950
01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:38,724
You're a talented guy, Tony.

951
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:41,331
I was sorry to see this happen.

952
01:13:43,320 --> 01:13:44,845
- You take care.
- Yeah.

953
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:48,527
Why are they taking Daddy's car?

954
01:13:49,080 --> 01:13:51,100
We'll talk about it later, baby, okay?

955
01:13:51,200 --> 01:13:52,260
Listen, why don't you go inside

956
01:13:52,360 --> 01:13:55,011
and knock out some chores
before lunch, all right? Okay.

957
01:14:12,120 --> 01:14:14,780
I picked up a couple more houses
to sell this morning.

958
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:17,963
Asked Mandy to give me everything
she could for the next couple months.

959
01:14:19,160 --> 01:14:20,286
That's good, Liz.

960
01:14:22,280 --> 01:14:23,441
Can we talk?

961
01:14:24,240 --> 01:14:25,321
Sure.

962
01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:38,527
I just don't understand
why you treat me this way.

963
01:14:41,960 --> 01:14:44,140
When I told you
what happened with my job,

964
01:14:44,240 --> 01:14:45,620
I expected you to hit the ceiling, Liz.

965
01:14:45,720 --> 01:14:49,406
So, in my mind, I was ready
to defend myself.

966
01:14:52,840 --> 01:14:54,922
Except this time, I can't.

967
01:14:58,360 --> 01:15:00,249
And I hate saying this...

968
01:15:05,240 --> 01:15:07,208
But I deserved to get fired.

969
01:15:09,480 --> 01:15:10,766
I was deceiving them.

970
01:15:13,160 --> 01:15:14,844
And I was deceiving you.

971
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:22,448
I almost cheated on you, Liz.

972
01:15:26,080 --> 01:15:27,445
I thought about it.

973
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:31,171
I almost did it.

974
01:15:36,280 --> 01:15:37,964
But you know all this.

975
01:15:40,280 --> 01:15:42,044
And you're still here.

976
01:15:43,960 --> 01:15:45,689
Then I see your closet,

977
01:15:48,520 --> 01:15:50,249
and the way you praying for me.

978
01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:55,330
Why would you do that

979
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:01,407
when you see the type
of man I've become?

980
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:05,763
'Cause I'm not done with us.

981
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:10,847
I will fight for our marriage.

982
01:16:12,520 --> 01:16:15,285
But I've learned that my contentment
can't come from you.

983
01:16:17,320 --> 01:16:19,846
Tony, I love you.

984
01:16:23,320 --> 01:16:25,687
But I am His before I'm yours.

985
01:16:27,440 --> 01:16:32,401
And because I love Jesus,
I'm staying right here.

986
01:16:44,280 --> 01:16:45,805
I'm sorry, Liz.

987
01:16:54,440 --> 01:16:56,204
I asked God to forgive me,

988
01:16:58,240 --> 01:17:00,004
but I need you to forgive me.

989
01:17:02,360 --> 01:17:04,283
I don't want you to quit on me, Liz.

990
01:17:05,880 --> 01:17:06,881
I will.

991
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:09,925
I forgive you.

992
01:17:11,280 --> 01:17:12,645
I forgive you.

993
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:15,961
I'm sorry.

994
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:17,880
Thank you, Lord.

995
01:17:26,160 --> 01:17:28,083
And this just happened now?

996
01:17:28,480 --> 01:17:29,606
He did?

997
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:32,085
Well, what'd he say?

998
01:17:33,320 --> 01:17:35,641
Oh, sweet Jesus. Lord!

999
01:17:37,560 --> 01:17:42,327
See, I told you, Elizabeth.
I told you that God would fight for you.

1000
01:17:43,360 --> 01:17:46,284
Oh, Jesus!
All right, baby, I'll talk to you soon.

1001
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:55,564
Devil, you just got your butt kicked!

1002
01:17:56,800 --> 01:17:58,962
My God is faithful.

1003
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:02,165
And my God is powerful.

1004
01:18:02,280 --> 01:18:04,780
And my God is in charge.

1005
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:08,580
You can't fire Him
and He'll never retire!

1006
01:18:08,680 --> 01:18:10,887
Thank you, Jesus. Glory Hallelujah!

1007
01:18:11,560 --> 01:18:14,020
My God is good

1008
01:18:14,120 --> 01:18:18,011
My God is good, and He's faithful

1009
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:20,940
Hey, Danielle.

1010
01:18:21,040 --> 01:18:22,121
Hey, Daddy.

1011
01:18:32,280 --> 01:18:34,248
Listen, I need to tell you something.

1012
01:18:38,920 --> 01:18:41,651
I don't think I've been
a very good dad to you.

1013
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:50,646
And I haven't been very loving
to your mother either.

1014
01:18:56,400 --> 01:18:58,243
I can do better, Danielle.

1015
01:18:59,160 --> 01:19:01,481
You both deserve better from me.

1016
01:19:04,360 --> 01:19:05,805
But you know what?

1017
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:08,483
I've asked God to help me.

1018
01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:11,481
And

1019
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:14,604
I wanted to ask you

1020
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:17,888
if you would forgive me

1021
01:19:18,760 --> 01:19:20,728
and give me another chance.

1022
01:19:22,720 --> 01:19:24,006
Think you can do that?

1023
01:19:32,600 --> 01:19:34,648
Listen, I do love you, Danielle.

1024
01:19:37,320 --> 01:19:38,845
I love you too, Daddy.

1025
01:20:00,360 --> 01:20:03,060
We're sorry. You have reached a number
that has been disconnected

1026
01:20:03,160 --> 01:20:05,242
or is no longer in service.

1027
01:20:15,080 --> 01:20:18,243
Slow down, I'm old. You know, I'm old now.
Okay, here we go.

1028
01:20:20,080 --> 01:20:22,287
Okay! I'm in there!

1029
01:20:23,120 --> 01:20:24,420
- Keep going!
- You got it!

1030
01:20:24,520 --> 01:20:25,965
Okay. I'm trying! My knees!

1031
01:20:26,720 --> 01:20:28,580
Here we go. Got the turn.

1032
01:20:28,680 --> 01:20:30,921
What's the other move, Danielle?
Okay, wait.

1033
01:20:31,680 --> 01:20:34,100
- Good grief!
- Daddy, why don't you jump with us?

1034
01:20:34,200 --> 01:20:35,860
Yeah, that would be awesome!

1035
01:20:35,960 --> 01:20:37,883
No, no. I don't think
they let parents do that.

1036
01:20:38,240 --> 01:20:41,220
Yeah, they do. But no parents
do 'cause they can't keep up.

1037
01:20:41,320 --> 01:20:43,322
- Oh, really?
- Dad, it's an open league.

1038
01:20:43,440 --> 01:20:45,761
You can jump in the freestyle competition.
They'll let you.

1039
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:49,004
Look, tell you what.
Let me think about it, okay?

1040
01:20:49,360 --> 01:20:50,740
Okay, I'll think about it. All right?

1041
01:20:50,840 --> 01:20:52,980
Now if I'm gonna do it, I wanna do it right.
So let's try it again.

1042
01:20:53,080 --> 01:20:54,740
Get it going. Get it going for me.

1043
01:20:54,840 --> 01:20:57,300
Okay, here we go.
Here we go. Okay. Okay.

1044
01:20:57,400 --> 01:20:59,880
All right, here we go.
Turn. And we turn...

1045
01:21:15,160 --> 01:21:16,241
Tony?

1046
01:21:25,120 --> 01:21:26,645
Tony, what are you doing?

1047
01:21:29,400 --> 01:21:30,731
I'm struggling.

1048
01:21:35,480 --> 01:21:36,641
With what?

1049
01:21:47,160 --> 01:21:48,321
What is this?

1050
01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:51,331
It was my bonus plan.

1051
01:21:52,600 --> 01:21:54,011
Where did you get these?

1052
01:21:55,920 --> 01:21:59,367
I've been keeping some for myself
each time I take samples to a client.

1053
01:22:01,160 --> 01:22:02,969
I thought they had to sign
for what you gave them.

1054
01:22:03,240 --> 01:22:05,129
There's ways around that, Liz.

1055
01:22:08,080 --> 01:22:10,128
Tony, you gotta take these back.

1056
01:22:10,680 --> 01:22:12,842
Liz, I could be prosecuted for this.

1057
01:22:18,040 --> 01:22:19,929
Look, I've already lost my job.

1058
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:24,281
So, now I'm supposed to go and tell Danielle
her daddy might be going to jail?

1059
01:22:28,280 --> 01:22:30,169
Then why are you struggling?

1060
01:22:46,640 --> 01:22:48,020
What you have there
is fourth-quarter projections.

1061
01:22:48,120 --> 01:22:49,700
Now, if anything's off on that, don't...

1062
01:22:49,800 --> 01:22:52,246
Coleman, Tony Jordan's here to see you.

1063
01:22:54,680 --> 01:22:56,820
- Do you know what he wants?
- He didn't say.

1064
01:22:56,920 --> 01:22:59,241
Just said he wants five minutes
of your time.

1065
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:09,483
Tony? Coleman's waiting for you
in the conference room.

1066
01:23:10,480 --> 01:23:11,606
Thank you.

1067
01:23:28,520 --> 01:23:29,726
Hello, Tony.

1068
01:23:31,240 --> 01:23:32,765
Coleman. Tom.

1069
01:23:34,440 --> 01:23:36,602
Look, I appreciate you guys
meeting with me.

1070
01:23:37,280 --> 01:23:40,460
I just need to bring you something back
that belongs to the company,

1071
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:41,891
and apologize for taking it.

1072
01:23:42,840 --> 01:23:44,285
What's in the box?

1073
01:23:55,320 --> 01:23:57,340
You weren't just padding your numbers,

1074
01:23:57,440 --> 01:24:01,570
you were stealing samples
and selling them. Is that right?

1075
01:24:05,920 --> 01:24:07,763
Let me get this straight.

1076
01:24:08,400 --> 01:24:12,485
We give you a high salary
with awards and benefits and trips,

1077
01:24:13,200 --> 01:24:16,488
and you decide to thank us
by taking even more for yourself?

1078
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,082
Do you realize
we could have you prosecuted for this?

1079
01:24:20,200 --> 01:24:21,281
Tom.

1080
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:36,809
Why would you bring this in now?

1081
01:24:39,480 --> 01:24:43,644
Because I needed to confess what I've done
and ask for your forgiveness.

1082
01:24:44,280 --> 01:24:45,691
Forgiveness?

1083
01:24:47,080 --> 01:24:49,580
I mean, how long
have you been doing this?

1084
01:24:49,680 --> 01:24:51,170
How much money did you make?

1085
01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:53,481
About $19,000.

1086
01:24:54,040 --> 01:24:55,166
19,000?

1087
01:24:56,360 --> 01:24:58,089
- Is that all? Really?
- Tom.

1088
01:25:06,320 --> 01:25:07,924
Tony, it doesn't make sense
that you would do this

1089
01:25:08,040 --> 01:25:09,929
after you've already been terminated.

1090
01:25:11,640 --> 01:25:12,971
I realize that.

1091
01:25:14,040 --> 01:25:17,089
But I've gotten right with my family.
I've gotten right with God.

1092
01:25:18,200 --> 01:25:19,929
But I need to get right with you.

1093
01:25:21,520 --> 01:25:24,046
So I'm ready to accept
whatever decision you make.

1094
01:25:26,040 --> 01:25:27,610
Including arrest?

1095
01:25:29,240 --> 01:25:30,605
Whatever the consequence.

1096
01:25:32,600 --> 01:25:34,020
That makes it easier for us.

1097
01:25:34,120 --> 01:25:36,805
- Coleman, it's time to call the authorities.
- Not yet.

1098
01:25:38,880 --> 01:25:40,803
Tony, are you willing
to sign a statement?

1099
01:25:42,320 --> 01:25:43,401
I am.

1100
01:25:44,200 --> 01:25:45,850
Then I want two days to think about it.

1101
01:25:46,200 --> 01:25:47,645
- Two days?
- Yes.

1102
01:25:50,280 --> 01:25:51,725
You'll hear from me by then.

1103
01:25:53,240 --> 01:25:54,287
Thank you.

1104
01:26:04,360 --> 01:26:07,100
Hey, girls. Why don't you go inside
and grab something cold to drink?

1105
01:26:07,200 --> 01:26:08,531
Okay? We can start back in a little bit.

1106
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:09,926
- Okay. Thanks, Ms. Jordan.
- All right.

1107
01:26:11,560 --> 01:26:12,891
Hey. Hey.

1108
01:26:15,880 --> 01:26:17,041
Well?

1109
01:26:18,800 --> 01:26:20,086
I don't know.

1110
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,651
I mean, Tom just wanted
to throw me in jail.

1111
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,048
But Coleman says he wants two days
to think about it.

1112
01:26:28,040 --> 01:26:30,850
- Really? Did he seem angry?
- I couldn't tell.

1113
01:26:33,920 --> 01:26:36,060
Liz, this was the most awkward thing
I've ever done.

1114
01:26:36,160 --> 01:26:37,491
Yeah, but you did it.

1115
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,128
Listen, you did the right thing.

1116
01:26:41,400 --> 01:26:43,129
Now we just have to pray and wait.

1117
01:26:45,400 --> 01:26:48,380
Hey, why don't you go change?
Just come practice with your daughter.

1118
01:26:48,480 --> 01:26:50,780
Liz, why should I practice
for a competition when I might be in jail?

1119
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:52,644
You don't know that.

1120
01:26:53,680 --> 01:26:55,967
Whatever happens, we trust God, right?

1121
01:26:57,680 --> 01:26:58,761
Right.

1122
01:27:03,640 --> 01:27:05,688
This is crazy. You know that, right?

1123
01:28:15,200 --> 01:28:16,281
You're nervous.

1124
01:28:18,240 --> 01:28:19,810
Trying not to think about it.

1125
01:28:20,240 --> 01:28:21,924
What time are you supposed to be there?

1126
01:28:23,680 --> 01:28:24,806
9:00.

1127
01:28:38,160 --> 01:28:40,083
- Coleman?
- Hello, Tony.

1128
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:43,167
- Hi, Elizabeth.
- Hi, Coleman. How are you?

1129
01:28:43,400 --> 01:28:44,580
I'm fine, thank you.

1130
01:28:44,680 --> 01:28:48,765
I know this is unexpected, but I wondered
if you might give me a few minutes to talk.

1131
01:28:49,400 --> 01:28:51,926
- Yeah, sure. Come on in.
- Thank you.

1132
01:28:58,520 --> 01:29:00,921
Tony, I've been thinking
about your visit.

1133
01:29:02,240 --> 01:29:05,449
It's probably all I've thought about
the past two days.

1134
01:29:06,440 --> 01:29:08,090
What you did was wrong.

1135
01:29:09,080 --> 01:29:10,764
And I was disappointed.

1136
01:29:12,400 --> 01:29:17,486
But we've fired salesmen before,
and well, life goes on.

1137
01:29:20,080 --> 01:29:22,082
But then you showed back up.

1138
01:29:24,520 --> 01:29:28,605
And, Tony, I've never seen anybody do
what you did.

1139
01:29:31,360 --> 01:29:35,020
I've never seen a man take total
responsibility for his wrongdoing,

1140
01:29:35,120 --> 01:29:36,963
no matter the consequence.

1141
01:29:38,920 --> 01:29:40,843
And I kept asking myself, why?

1142
01:29:41,920 --> 01:29:43,490
Why would you do that?

1143
01:29:45,800 --> 01:29:47,643
The only answer I can come up with

1144
01:29:48,760 --> 01:29:51,445
is that you were sincere
in your desire to make it right,

1145
01:29:52,120 --> 01:29:54,282
and that you regret what you've done.

1146
01:29:55,520 --> 01:29:57,488
So I've chosen to believe you.

1147
01:29:59,640 --> 01:30:01,483
I can't give you your job back,

1148
01:30:04,400 --> 01:30:06,482
but I've decided not to prosecute.

1149
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:19,691
I do think it would be appropriate
to return the $19,000 back to the company.

1150
01:30:22,440 --> 01:30:26,240
- Yeah, we've already decided to do that.
- Very good.

1151
01:30:26,880 --> 01:30:30,009
Well, if you'll sign an agreement
to that effect,

1152
01:30:30,720 --> 01:30:32,609
I think we should all move on.

1153
01:30:33,880 --> 01:30:38,841
So if you don't mind me seeing myself out,
I'll give you your evening back.

1154
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:45,500
- Thank you, Tony.
- Thank you.

1155
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:47,284
- Elizabeth.
- Thank you.

1156
01:31:06,720 --> 01:31:08,722
Tony, that was grace!

1157
01:31:13,200 --> 01:31:15,885
That was God's grace toward us.

1158
01:31:22,680 --> 01:31:24,250
Thank you, Jesus.

1159
01:31:55,440 --> 01:31:58,125
I just love these old houses.
They have so much character.

1160
01:31:58,240 --> 01:31:59,340
Yeah. I agree.

1161
01:31:59,440 --> 01:32:05,020
Well, the master bath was updated recently,
but she kept the original tub.

1162
01:32:05,120 --> 01:32:07,420
And all the tiles are brand new.

1163
01:32:07,520 --> 01:32:11,445
And, you know, I think this is best of all,
the floor is original hardwoods.

1164
01:32:12,240 --> 01:32:15,020
- I love hardwood floors.
- And you know what I found?

1165
01:32:15,120 --> 01:32:17,420
The neighborhood is so great
because it's established.

1166
01:32:17,520 --> 01:32:21,684
And quiet, you know? It seems mature.
How long have you guys been in ministry?

1167
01:32:22,640 --> 01:32:25,803
Charles pastored the same church
for 35 years.

1168
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:29,780
But, you know, we loved it,
but we knew it was time for a change,

1169
01:32:29,880 --> 01:32:33,726
and we wanted to be near our kids
and grandkids to help mentor them.

1170
01:32:34,480 --> 01:32:37,290
Charles, what are you doing?

1171
01:32:40,560 --> 01:32:42,483
Someone's been praying in this closet.

1172
01:32:43,360 --> 01:32:46,648
That's right. That was her prayer closet.
How did you know that?

1173
01:32:48,400 --> 01:32:51,165
It's almost like it's baked in.

1174
01:32:57,160 --> 01:32:59,640
Ma'am, we'll take the house.

1175
01:33:09,520 --> 01:33:11,740
Well, hello. Come on in.
You must be Elizabeth.

1176
01:33:11,840 --> 01:33:14,810
- Yes, thank you.
- Hey, there, young lady.

1177
01:33:15,760 --> 01:33:19,481
- You're C.W. Williams, the city manager.
- I am.

1178
01:33:19,840 --> 01:33:22,220
- You're Clyde?
- I'm Clyde.

1179
01:33:22,320 --> 01:33:25,740
- You got to be kidding me.
- Hey, Elizabeth!

1180
01:33:25,840 --> 01:33:28,420
- Hey, Danielle!
- Nice to meet you.

1181
01:33:28,520 --> 01:33:29,931
I'll let you all catch up.

1182
01:33:30,880 --> 01:33:33,804
You never told me that your son
was the city manager!

1183
01:33:33,920 --> 01:33:37,083
I didn't? My son's the city manager.

1184
01:33:38,080 --> 01:33:40,287
Okay. I got some good news for you.

1185
01:33:40,440 --> 01:33:43,205
I bet you gonna tell me

1186
01:33:44,160 --> 01:33:49,724
that a retired pastor from Texas
and his wife wanna buy my house.

1187
01:33:50,080 --> 01:33:51,320
Now see,

1188
01:33:51,880 --> 01:33:53,860
see, that's the kind of relationship
with God I want.

1189
01:33:53,960 --> 01:33:56,281
I want Him speaking to me like that.
What did He say?

1190
01:33:56,400 --> 01:33:58,140
Well, it was actually your daughter.

1191
01:33:58,240 --> 01:34:01,562
She texted me on my new smart phone
on the way over here.

1192
01:34:03,480 --> 01:34:06,300
Don't be mad, Mom!
I hardly get to text anybody!

1193
01:34:06,400 --> 01:34:08,380
And this thing is so handy.

1194
01:34:08,480 --> 01:34:11,700
I've already downloaded
a couple prayer apps,

1195
01:34:11,800 --> 01:34:14,121
and got a couple gospel songs.

1196
01:34:18,920 --> 01:34:19,980
All right, guys.

1197
01:34:20,080 --> 01:34:22,580
Wanna take these popsicles outside,
eat them on the back porch?

1198
01:34:22,680 --> 01:34:26,969
Here we go. Two hot cups of coffee.

1199
01:34:27,960 --> 01:34:29,962
Well, if it's hot, then I'll drink it.

1200
01:34:33,760 --> 01:34:36,180
Now, we're still gonna get together
for our little chats, right?

1201
01:34:36,280 --> 01:34:37,420
Oh, yes!

1202
01:34:37,520 --> 01:34:41,140
- But now it can't just be the both of us.
- What do you mean?

1203
01:34:41,240 --> 01:34:45,928
You need to find a young woman
to invest in, and I'll do the same.

1204
01:34:46,640 --> 01:34:49,405
We all need help every now and then.

1205
01:34:49,720 --> 01:34:54,540
Ms. Clara, I really can't tell you
how much your friendship means to me.

1206
01:34:54,640 --> 01:34:56,580
That goes for the both of us.

1207
01:34:56,680 --> 01:35:00,844
No, really. I wasn't willing to admit
how much help I needed.

1208
01:35:01,520 --> 01:35:04,220
And I needed somebody to wake me up

1209
01:35:04,320 --> 01:35:07,767
from the insanity of doing
the same thing over and over.

1210
01:35:08,440 --> 01:35:10,442
You've been a gift from God to me.

1211
01:35:10,960 --> 01:35:13,725
Don't you think that
this has been one-sided.

1212
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:17,980
This has meant more to me than you know.

1213
01:35:18,080 --> 01:35:19,161
Well, good.

1214
01:35:20,480 --> 01:35:23,740
I can't imagine how much your prayers
and your passion for God

1215
01:35:23,840 --> 01:35:25,220
must have meant to your husband.

1216
01:35:25,320 --> 01:35:27,129
Gosh, I wish I could've met him.

1217
01:35:28,360 --> 01:35:29,566
No.

1218
01:35:30,320 --> 01:35:31,651
No, you don't.

1219
01:35:32,600 --> 01:35:35,126
See, I wasn't the same woman back then.

1220
01:35:36,320 --> 01:35:40,086
When Leo died,
we were not on good terms.

1221
01:35:41,240 --> 01:35:47,327
I always felt pushed to the back burner
while the military took first place in his life.

1222
01:35:48,040 --> 01:35:52,602
And I was... I was bitter, Elizabeth.
I was so bitter.

1223
01:35:53,800 --> 01:35:57,646
But even then,
God was showing me what to do.

1224
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:04,803
He was prompting me to fight for Leo,
to pray for Leo, and I refused.

1225
01:36:05,720 --> 01:36:10,203
And I kept pushing it back
and pushing it back until it was too late.

1226
01:36:11,960 --> 01:36:18,809
And there's no grief as great
as denying the truth until it's too late.

1227
01:36:20,280 --> 01:36:22,328
It was my selfish pride, Elizabeth.

1228
01:36:24,720 --> 01:36:26,688
My selfish pride!

1229
01:36:29,800 --> 01:36:31,848
And I confessed it.

1230
01:36:33,240 --> 01:36:37,848
And I repented,
and I begged God to forgive me.

1231
01:36:39,240 --> 01:36:41,288
But I still have a scar.

1232
01:36:43,640 --> 01:36:47,361
And then I started spending more time
with the Lord,

1233
01:36:47,880 --> 01:36:49,564
and in His word.

1234
01:36:51,240 --> 01:36:53,846
And I learned how to fight

1235
01:36:54,880 --> 01:36:56,484
in prayer first.

1236
01:37:00,520 --> 01:37:02,124
I'm an old woman now.

1237
01:37:03,600 --> 01:37:09,084
And I realized that I have not passed on
what I had learned.

1238
01:37:11,440 --> 01:37:14,205
And when I last visited Leo's grave,

1239
01:37:15,320 --> 01:37:18,403
I asked God to send me someone
that I could help.

1240
01:37:19,680 --> 01:37:23,048
Someone that I could teach to fight
the right way.

1241
01:37:25,200 --> 01:37:28,488
And He sent me Elizabeth Jordan.

1242
01:37:32,480 --> 01:37:35,211
So you see, you,

1243
01:37:39,720 --> 01:37:42,121
you were the answer to my prayer.

1244
01:37:44,640 --> 01:37:50,966
Well, now you've got to teach
other people to seek the Lord.

1245
01:37:51,920 --> 01:37:55,288
You've got to teach other young wives
how to fight.

1246
01:37:56,520 --> 01:37:58,682
Yeah. I will.

1247
01:38:00,440 --> 01:38:01,646
I will.

1248
01:38:10,120 --> 01:38:13,420
- Mom, did you bring my snack?
- Yeah, baby, I got it right here.

1249
01:38:13,520 --> 01:38:16,330
- Hey, Danielle, are you nervous?
- Very.

1250
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:19,167
- Are you nervous?
- Oh, yeah!

1251
01:38:19,640 --> 01:38:22,340
But I'll be fine just as long as
I don't fall on my face.

1252
01:38:22,440 --> 01:38:24,060
Are you still gonna do that flip?

1253
01:38:24,160 --> 01:38:26,580
Yeah, I'm gonna do the flip.
And that's not all.

1254
01:38:26,680 --> 01:38:30,220
Huh, Danielle?
You ain't seen nothing yet, Liz.

1255
01:38:30,320 --> 01:38:32,004
Now I'm nervous.

1256
01:38:35,400 --> 01:38:36,970
Tony, isn't that Tom?

1257
01:38:39,680 --> 01:38:41,045
Yeah, it is.

1258
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:43,365
Looks like a flat.

1259
01:38:44,160 --> 01:38:47,209
No. No! No. No, I can't wait that long!

1260
01:38:47,840 --> 01:38:51,811
Why do you promote helping out
in 30 minutes when it takes 45 to get here?

1261
01:38:53,680 --> 01:38:55,300
Listen, you guys stay put.

1262
01:38:55,400 --> 01:38:58,085
You know, I don't care.
Just send someone!

1263
01:39:57,800 --> 01:39:59,529
Why did you do that?

1264
01:40:00,440 --> 01:40:03,046
'Cause that's how
I wanna be treated, Danielle.

1265
01:40:22,680 --> 01:40:23,761
Wow!

1266
01:40:25,200 --> 01:40:27,220
I'm so proud of you
for everything that you've done.

1267
01:40:27,320 --> 01:40:29,780
And I just can't wait to see
what you guys do out there.

1268
01:40:29,880 --> 01:40:31,300
- You wanna say something to them?
- Yeah, yeah.

1269
01:40:31,400 --> 01:40:34,180
- Okay, good.
- Listen, I just spoke with the judges. Okay?

1270
01:40:34,280 --> 01:40:36,681
- They've agreed to let us go last. All right?
- Yes!

1271
01:40:36,800 --> 01:40:39,380
Remember what we talked about?
We'll be the last thing they see.

1272
01:40:39,480 --> 01:40:42,740
We'll be impressive. All right?
Listen, I know you guys are nervous.

1273
01:40:42,840 --> 01:40:44,100
Believe me, I am, too.

1274
01:40:44,200 --> 01:40:47,540
But we're gonna take that nervous energy
and we're gonna turn it into rocket fuel.

1275
01:40:47,640 --> 01:40:48,860
- All right? You guys are with me?
- Yeah.

1276
01:40:48,960 --> 01:40:50,020
All right, let's blow them away.

1277
01:40:50,120 --> 01:40:52,820
Here we go. Comets on three.
All right, one, two, three.

1278
01:40:52,920 --> 01:40:54,160
Comets!

1279
01:40:56,480 --> 01:40:58,700
Welcome to the
Double Dutch Citywide Championship.

1280
01:40:58,800 --> 01:41:00,564
Who's ready for an awesome day?

1281
01:41:03,840 --> 01:41:07,640
All right. We're getting started right now
with the speed round. Here we go!

1282
01:41:37,360 --> 01:41:40,500
All right, so the speed scores
will be added to the freestyle scores.

1283
01:41:40,600 --> 01:41:42,820
So let's start
the freestyle competition.

1284
01:41:42,920 --> 01:41:44,763
First up is the Moon Jumpers.

1285
01:41:54,040 --> 01:41:56,281
Next up is the Mustangs!

1286
01:42:10,520 --> 01:42:12,966
Now let's give it up for the Tigers!

1287
01:42:26,280 --> 01:42:28,567
Here come the SkipSations!

1288
01:42:45,560 --> 01:42:47,767
Now for the Speed Angels!

1289
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:11,606
Let's hear it for the Super Skippers!

1290
01:43:38,280 --> 01:43:40,940
And now for the final team
in our freestyle competition.

1291
01:43:41,040 --> 01:43:42,963
Let's hear it for the Comets!

1292
01:44:57,560 --> 01:45:00,325
That's my dad! That's my dad!

1293
01:45:07,480 --> 01:45:08,660
The judges' scores are in.

1294
01:45:08,760 --> 01:45:12,810
Ln third place this year,
let's hear it for the Super Skippers!

1295
01:45:19,840 --> 01:45:23,765
And in second place, it was so close!
Let's hear it for the Comets!

1296
01:45:37,720 --> 01:45:41,220
And now our Double Dutch
Citywide Champions for this year,

1297
01:45:41,320 --> 01:45:43,891
let's hear it for the Speed Angels!

1298
01:45:58,320 --> 01:45:59,970
Hey, what are you doing?

1299
01:46:00,080 --> 01:46:02,811
- Hey, hey.
- What's going on?

1300
01:46:05,520 --> 01:46:08,300
I'll tell you in a minute, okay?
How was dinner?

1301
01:46:08,400 --> 01:46:09,686
It was good.

1302
01:46:09,800 --> 01:46:12,020
Cynthia actually agreed to meet with me
on a regular basis.

1303
01:46:12,120 --> 01:46:13,180
Good. Good.

1304
01:46:13,280 --> 01:46:15,567
- We'll try Tuesday afternoons to start.
- Okay.

1305
01:46:15,720 --> 01:46:18,740
Now listen, did they forgive me
for not helping them out?

1306
01:46:18,840 --> 01:46:20,649
Yeah. I think so.

1307
01:46:21,320 --> 01:46:24,220
You know, they really appreciated
the $500 we gave them though.

1308
01:46:24,320 --> 01:46:27,420
I told her we really wanted to do more
but we just couldn't right now

1309
01:46:27,520 --> 01:46:29,249
the way things are tight with money.

1310
01:46:29,360 --> 01:46:31,886
She understood. But we did skip dessert.

1311
01:46:32,280 --> 01:46:33,611
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1312
01:46:34,840 --> 01:46:37,460
Well, listen, I got something
I need to tell you. Okay?

1313
01:46:37,560 --> 01:46:40,140
Now I want you to think about it
before you respond, okay?

1314
01:46:40,240 --> 01:46:41,526
What is it?

1315
01:46:42,720 --> 01:46:46,520
I had an interview today.
And I got offered the job on the spot.

1316
01:46:47,080 --> 01:46:48,286
To do what?

1317
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,480
To be the new director
at the community center.

1318
01:46:53,760 --> 01:46:56,001
Liz, we know this place so well.
You know?

1319
01:46:57,240 --> 01:47:00,130
I'm telling you, I can do this job.

1320
01:47:00,480 --> 01:47:03,086
Gosh. You would be closer to home.

1321
01:47:04,120 --> 01:47:08,330
It's only half the pay,
but if we're wise, I know we can make it.

1322
01:47:11,040 --> 01:47:12,485
Listen to me.

1323
01:47:13,600 --> 01:47:17,810
I would rather have a man chasing Jesus
than a house full of stuff.

1324
01:47:20,320 --> 01:47:21,401
Okay.

1325
01:47:22,400 --> 01:47:24,129
All right, then I'll accept it.

1326
01:47:26,040 --> 01:47:28,660
You know what, I'm kind of glad
you didn't have that dessert tonight.

1327
01:47:28,760 --> 01:47:29,940
Why?

1328
01:47:30,040 --> 01:47:34,045
I got something for you.
Why don't you have a seat on the couch?

1329
01:47:34,320 --> 01:47:36,260
- What?
- Just head to the couch.

1330
01:47:36,360 --> 01:47:38,203
I got this, don't worry about it.

1331
01:47:42,880 --> 01:47:44,086
Where's Danielle?

1332
01:47:44,200 --> 01:47:48,420
She's fine. She's over at Jennifer's house.
They're having a sleepover. Yeah.

1333
01:47:48,520 --> 01:47:49,931
What is this?

1334
01:47:51,080 --> 01:47:52,286
You'll see.

1335
01:47:52,680 --> 01:47:55,100
No, no, no. Tony, don't touch my feet.

1336
01:47:55,200 --> 01:47:58,647
Hey. Just roll with it. Okay?
All right, come on now.

1337
01:48:09,560 --> 01:48:11,608
Oh, my goodness, it feels so good.

1338
01:48:14,080 --> 01:48:16,526
Now it's time I give you
what you deserve.

1339
01:48:17,960 --> 01:48:21,931
This is for the woman I don't deserve.

1340
01:48:27,920 --> 01:48:29,980
You go ahead and work on that,

1341
01:48:30,080 --> 01:48:34,608
and I am gonna get started on that
foot massage you've been asking for.

1342
01:48:35,920 --> 01:48:37,160
Really?

1343
01:48:38,400 --> 01:48:41,290
- Are you really doing this for me?
- Yeah, come on now.

1344
01:48:42,760 --> 01:48:45,820
No, no, no, Tony!
I don't want you to smell my feet.

1345
01:48:45,920 --> 01:48:50,369
Babe, look. I told you,
I got this. You... Look.

1346
01:48:51,920 --> 01:48:55,845
You need to trust me, okay?
So, like that.

1347
01:48:58,800 --> 01:49:01,020
I'm ready to go. You hear me?

1348
01:49:01,120 --> 01:49:02,804
- You're terrible.
- Yeah.

1349
01:49:06,880 --> 01:49:07,961
What's wrong?

1350
01:49:08,600 --> 01:49:10,648
I'm eating my favorite dessert

1351
01:49:12,640 --> 01:49:15,291
while my husband is rubbing my feet.

1352
01:49:20,280 --> 01:49:22,806
There has got to be a God in Heaven!

1353
01:50:04,800 --> 01:50:06,564
You've done it again, Lord.

1354
01:50:07,600 --> 01:50:09,170
You've done it again.

1355
01:50:11,680 --> 01:50:16,971
You are good and You are mighty
and You are merciful!

1356
01:50:18,880 --> 01:50:23,260
And You keep taking care of me
when I don't deserve it.

1357
01:50:23,360 --> 01:50:25,408
Praise You, Jesus!

1358
01:50:26,320 --> 01:50:28,448
You are Lord.

1359
01:50:32,320 --> 01:50:34,243
Give me another one, Lord.

1360
01:50:35,560 --> 01:50:39,167
Guide me to who You want me to help.

1361
01:50:40,560 --> 01:50:44,121
Raise up more that will call upon
Your name!

1362
01:50:45,040 --> 01:50:49,820
Raise up those that love You
and seek You and trust You!

1363
01:50:49,920 --> 01:50:52,730
Raise them up, Lord! Raise them up!

1364
01:50:53,800 --> 01:51:00,081
Lord, we need a generation of believers
who are not ashamed of the gospel.

1365
01:51:00,920 --> 01:51:04,083
We need an army of believers, Lord,

1366
01:51:05,080 --> 01:51:07,447
that hate to be lukewarm

1367
01:51:08,240 --> 01:51:11,940
and will stand on Your word
above all else.

1368
01:51:12,040 --> 01:51:14,964
Raise them up, Lord. Raise them up.

1369
01:51:16,520 --> 01:51:20,081
I pray for unity among
those that love You.

1370
01:51:21,200 --> 01:51:26,445
I pray that You open their eyes
so that they can see Your truth, Lord.

1371
01:51:27,200 --> 01:51:31,967
I pray for Your hand
of protection and guidance!

1372
01:51:33,920 --> 01:51:39,370
Raise up a generation, Lord,
that will take light into this world.

1373
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:43,340
That will not compromise
when under pressure!

1374
01:51:43,440 --> 01:51:47,968
That will not cower, Lord,
when others fall away!

1375
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:52,980
Raise them up, Lord,
that they will proclaim

1376
01:51:53,080 --> 01:51:57,881
that there is salvation
in the name of Jesus Christ!

1377
01:51:58,160 --> 01:52:02,688
Raise up warriors, Lord,
who will fight on their knees,

1378
01:52:03,120 --> 01:52:06,647
who will worship You
with their whole hearts, Lord.

1379
01:52:07,080 --> 01:52:09,765
Lord, call us to battle,

1380
01:52:10,040 --> 01:52:15,649
that we may proclaim You
King of Kings and Lord of Lords!

1381
01:52:16,840 --> 01:52:20,367
I pray these things with all my heart!

1382
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:25,049
Raise them up, Lord! Raise them up!
