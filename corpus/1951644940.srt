00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:46,980
GOYA'S GHOSTS

2
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,980
HOLY OFFICE OF THE INQUISITION

3
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:10,340
And these are actually for sale
in the bookshops?

4
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:14,300
And in the streets as well,
Father.

5
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,690
- And in Toledo?
- In Toledo. In Salamanca,

6
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,800
Sevilla.

7
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,020
And in the Port of Cádiz.

8
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,460
So these prints
are sent abroad?

9
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,050
These are sold in Rome.

10
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,300
Even as far as Mexico.

11
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,290
This is how the world sees us.

12
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,570
This,
this is how the world is seeing us.

13
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,530
What is the name of the artist?

14
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,980
Francisco Goya.

15
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:53,780
Isn't he the man you commissioned
to paint your portrait?

16
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,540
He is, Father.

17
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,290
Why did you choose him?

18
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,370
In all humility, Father,

19
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,850
I chose him for the same reason
our King and the Queen

20
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:07,010
have appointed him
to be the Court painter.

21
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,410
They consider him the greatest
painter in Spain.

22
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:15,900
These prints are quite disturbing,
I must say.

23
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,680
Disturbing?

24
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,450
Yes, yes, of course they are.

25
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,860
But, Father, these prints

26
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:28,660
show us
the true face of our world.

27
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,050
Maybe your world,
Brother Lorenzo.

28
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,330
How can you call
these hideous images

29
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,220
"the true face of our world"?

30
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,130
There is but one world, Brother,

31
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:45,210
and it is neither yours, nor mine.
It is the Lord's.

32
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,450
Have you lost your sight,
Brother?

33
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,530
Do you not see what demonic filth
and degradation

34
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,620
this Goya is selling?

35
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,890
He's an agent
of the darkest powers!

36
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,890
Granted that he's decorated
chapels.

37
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,380
He's painted angels, yes,

38
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,610
but when your mother raises her
eyes to pray to God

39
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:08,340
whom do you think she sees?

40
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,610
Whom do you think Goya
is using as models

41
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,140
for his angels?

42
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,680
Harlots!

43
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:20,250
Those are whores smiling down
at your mother from the ceiling!

44
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,360
I assert

45
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,940
before all of you

46
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:28,860
that Goya is a valuable
member of the Church.

47
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,040
How so?

48
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:34,050
Father, I have met women

49
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,490
who cannot recite
a single prayer.

50
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,780
It's them...

51
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,810
We have to seek them out,

52
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,850
but what is our response?

53
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,860
Condemn this great
Spanish artist instead?

54
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,610
Or do you think,
by burning Goya's canvases

55
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,530
the evil this artist
has depicted

56
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,700
will go up in flames?

57
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,610
Why don't we look at ourselves?

58
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,370
What have we accomplished

59
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,540
in the last 50 years?

60
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,610
How many heretics
have we sent to the stake?

61
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,170
I will tell you exactly how many,
Father. Eight.

62
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,740
Eight burned at the stake.

63
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,980
Are you proposing we show

64
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,100
greater severity?

65
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:19,770
Yes, Father, yes.
We have to return to the old ways.

66
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:24,980
I'm talking about the God- fearing
ways of the past.

67
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:29,620
Are you prepared
to join this battle?

68
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,700
Never mind join,

69
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:36,020
grant me the wisdom to lead it,
Father.

70
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:53,940
Why doesn't that painting
have a face?

71
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,060
Because he's a ghost.

72
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,980
No, he is not!

73
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,970
Have you ever seen a ghost?

74
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,080
No.

75
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,370
But I have seen a witch.

76
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:15,090
- Oh, did you?
- Yes, but she had a face.

77
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,420
What did she look like?

78
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,980
She was all bent and creepy,

79
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,820
and she stank... Phew!

80
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,090
That's interesting.
Because the witch that I know

81
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,370
she's young, very lovely,

82
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,530
and she smells of jasmine.

83
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,490
- She does?
- She does.

84
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:38,740
And I'm working on her portrait
right now.

85
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,460
I'm no witch!

86
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,460
How do you know?

87
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,420
Am I allowed to say something?

88
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,060
- Please.
- I know that face.

89
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,650
She would not be
one of your angels

90
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:19,010
in the Florida chapel, would she?

91
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:23,180
Yes, she is.
You're dangerously perceptive.

92
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,330
This is probably a very naive

93
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:31,300
but I am a man of the cloth.

94
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,440
Do you...?

95
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:41,300
Do you painters not become very
intimate with your models?

96
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,100
It must be very...

97
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:45,920
tempting...

98
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,410
when you spend hours
and hours alone with,

99
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,260
not only beautiful,

100
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,980
but young girl.

101
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,890
Would you like me to include
your hands in the portrait?

102
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,370
- I'll leave that up to you.
- No, it's up to you to decide.

103
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,570
Hands are not easy to paint

104
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:09,130
and not everybody will spend
the extra money.

105
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,090
Well, what is the difference?

106
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:16,540
One hand, two thousand reales.
Two hands, three thousand.

107
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:26,010
Why did you agree to paint
my portrait?

108
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,120
Why not?

109
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:32,290
You have the reputation of mocking
the men of cloth in your work.

110
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,700
And harshly, I must say.

111
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,160
Do I?

112
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:42,050
Are you aware of how many powerful
enemies you have, Goya?

113
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:47,180
Fortunately, I also have
a few very powerful friends.

114
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,650
How have you been, dear Goya?

115
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:07,570
- As always, Your Majesty
- So don't complain.

116
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,730
I endeavor not to, Your Majesty.

117
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,980
Is this the wild steed

118
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,820
that I am to conquer today?

119
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,240
Oh, dear!

120
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:29,570
So how do you want me to ride?

121
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,410
How do you want history to perceive
you, madam?

122
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,860
The way I am,

123
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,780
young and beautiful.

124
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:30,020
Which one do you wish for supper,
my dear?

125
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,680
Maybe...

126
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,860
the vulture.

127
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,220
May I stay

128
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:49,300
and watch you work for a while?

129
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,610
Why, if I may have any say
in the matter, Your Majesty,

130
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:58,850
I'd prefer no- one see the work
before it's finished.

131
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,380
Am I intruding?

132
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,600
Yes,

133
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,420
you are, my dear.

134
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,260
Oh, I see.

135
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,700
As you wish,

136
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,780
as you will,

137
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,860
whatever is your pleasure.

138
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:54,260
How long do I have to sit up here?

139
00:11:55,840 --> 00:12:00,780
For as long as I may need you there,
Your Majesty.

140
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,540
See what I am carrying?

141
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:09,290
I must be a pious man, right?

142
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:13,220
But look at what
is really inside this.

143
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,680
Voltaire!

144
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,640
Voltaire!

145
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:21,700
The Dark Prince
of the darkest principles!

146
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,380
Devious. Devious.

147
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,580
Be vigilant, use your ears.

148
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,060
People talk.

149
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,330
You might hear somebody
claiming that matter

150
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:37,740
consists of very small elements,
called atoms.

151
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,300
Get his name.

152
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,890
He's a heretic

153
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,860
spreading these diabolical ideas

154
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:48,100
to poison the souls
of God- fearing people.

155
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:52,770
If you hear somebody talking
about 'The Temple',

156
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,100
instead of 'The Church',

157
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:59,530
he is either a Judaiser,
or, even worse, a Protestant.

158
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,900
Get his name.

159
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:04,170
If you are in a public place
and see a man

160
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:08,660
hiding his penis with his hand
while urinating

161
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:11,700
the man is probably circumcised.

162
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,050
And he's a Judaiser!

163
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,660
I am giving you
just a few examples

164
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:21,370
of what to look for,
whom to identify.

165
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:24,610
Bring their names to the attention
of Holy Office.

166
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,730
Your eyes, your ears,
your brain.

167
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,620
They are the servants of God.

168
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:14,210
Come on, Inés.
Taste it, it's good.

169
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,320
Come on.

170
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:45,580
- Hey, where are you going?
- Oh, she's going to the dwarf.

171
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,220
What did you do?

172
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:56,340
- Inés, wipe your mouth.
- No.

173
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:21,900
You have received a summons
from the Holy Office.

174
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,410
Do you have any idea
what it might be about?

175
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,520
No.

176
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,530
Where did you go with your brothers
last night?

177
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:30,660
The Tavern.

178
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,280
Think!

179
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,690
Did you say something sacrilegious?

180
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:36,800
No.

181
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,690
Was there an incident
they could hold against her?

182
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,690
She kissed the feet of a dwarf.

183
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,570
- You did?
- She did.

184
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:49,810
- Everyone did!
- You know, they can summon her

185
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,530
just to testify
against someone else?

186
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,820
Someone else?

187
00:15:54,920 --> 00:16:00,100
Is there someone you know
they might be interested in?

188
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,820
I don't know.

189
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:03,680
No!

190
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,540
Do not worry, my child.

191
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,120
My child.

192
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,650
In the name of the Father, and
of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.

193
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:50,760
Amen.

194
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,660
Sit down, please.

195
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,380
Are you Inés Bilbatua,

196
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,970
begat by one
Tomás Pio Bilbatua

197
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,130
and his wife María Isabel?

198
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,490
- Yes, I am.
- We have only a few questions

199
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,090
and we expect you
to answer truthfully.

200
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,200
I will.

201
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:17,610
Is it true that on Wednesday,
the 16th of this month

202
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:21,220
you dined at the inn
of Dona Julia?

203
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,660
Yes, it is.

204
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,540
What were you served that evening?

205
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:31,140
- For dinner?
- Oh, yes.

206
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:35,860
You actually want to know
what we ate?

207
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,020
For dinner.

208
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,860
I had chicken.

209
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,360
Onions,

210
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,560
chickpeas.

211
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,200
Chickpeas.

212
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:05,920
And?

213
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,400
Potatoes.

214
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,780
Green peppers.

215
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,700
Were you served pork?

216
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:20,330
Yes, but I didn't have any.

217
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:24,020
- Why not?
- I don't like the taste.

218
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,970
Are you prepared to swear
on the Holy Cross

219
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,490
that you're telling the truth?

220
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,020
About the pork?

221
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,880
Are you?

222
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:38,930
I swear on Jesus's sacred wounds,
I'm telling you the truth.

223
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:41,610
And I suppose
that you would not object

224
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:44,290
if we gave you an opportunity
to prove it?

225
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,700
No, I would be grateful.

226
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,340
How would you like me to prove it?

227
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,570
Did you tell us the truth?

228
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,260
Yes! Yes, I did!

229
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,970
We have reason
to suspect otherwise.

230
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,080
Why?

231
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:23,610
We suspect the reason you avoid pork
is because you are secret Judaiser.

232
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:24,720
What?

233
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,940
- Are you?
- What is that?

234
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:31,010
You practice Jewish rituals.

235
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,460
No, I do not!

236
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,770
You have something to confess.
Do it now.

237
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,860
But I...
What do you want me to confess?

238
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,520
The truth.

239
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,460
But I did!

240
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,660
Tell me what the truth is!

241
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:56,020
Tell me what the truth is!

242
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:23,690
Hey, Tomás, how wonderful
to see you, my friend.

243
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:28,100
- How are you, Francisco?
- Come in, come in.

244
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:34,570
- Can I offer you anything?
- No, nothing, thank you.

245
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,940
Are we alone?

246
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,200
Yes.

247
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:44,930
I need to speak with this man,
Francisco.

248
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,040
Why?

249
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:52,620
My daughter Inés has been summoned
by the Holy Office.

250
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,780
- Inés?
- Yes.

251
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,260
That's preposterous.

252
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:01,930
She went in this morning
and she hasn't come out yet.

253
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:05,620
And we haven't heard
a word, either.

254
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,210
Do you know why they
wanted to talk to her?

255
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:13,250
No. That's why I would like
to speak with this man.

256
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:17,890
Francisco, I'm very sorry
to have to ask you this,

257
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,980
but is there any way
you can arrange it?

258
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:31,050
But I'm in no position to curry
favors from the Inquisition...

259
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:34,650
No, no favors.
I'm simply trying to learn

260
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:39,450
if there is anything at all
I can do to help my daughter.

261
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,660
I wish I...

262
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:49,050
No! I cannot talk
to the Holy Office

263
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,660
about any matter

264
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,850
that does not pertain directly
to me.

265
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:54,980
I'm sorry.

266
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,100
I beg you, Francisco.

267
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,540
Father Lorenzo.

268
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,240
Come in.

269
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,280
This way.

270
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,250
If I were to meet this man
on the street,

271
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:04,020
I would never recognize myself
in him.

272
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:09,580
One has such a different idea
of oneself.

273
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:14,610
You think you might like him?

274
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,890
I know I like the painting of him.

275
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,020
Yes, yes...

276
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,690
I'm very pleased
with it, Francisco.

277
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:27,770
- Shall I choose a frame for it?
- Yes, please, do.

278
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:31,570
- And there's no need to send money.
- What do you mean?

279
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:35,490
- Somebody's paying for it.
- Who's paying for it?

280
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,140
His name is Tomás Bilbatua.

281
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:42,180
He's a very rich merchant.

282
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,290
He also intends to underwrite

283
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:48,330
the reconstruction of the Convent
of Saint Tomás.

284
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:51,690
He's also asked me to paint
frescos throughout the Convent,

285
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:55,490
which is a very welcome
commission, I must admit.

286
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,540
- What is his name?
- Bilbatua.

287
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:02,980
What does Senor Bilbatua want
from me?

288
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,970
He's the father of...

289
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:12,930
You recall seeing her face on the
ceiling in the Florida chapel?

290
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,040
Yes?

291
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:18,580
She's been arrested
by the Holy Office.

292
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:26,180
I know him quite well.
He's a very honorable man.

293
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,340
Don't be afraid.

294
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:01,180
- Inés Bilbatua?
- Yes.

295
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:12,580
I am hereto see if I can...

296
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,770
possibly be of some assistance.

297
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,700
May I go home now?

298
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:23,370
I don't have the power
to decide that, Inés.

299
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,060
I wanna go home.

300
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:31,420
Do not fear, my child.

301
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:40,290
I can deliver a message
to your family...

302
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,050
Do you want me to?

303
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,160
Please.

304
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:47,860
Will you tell them
that I love them?

305
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,500
I love them so much.

306
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,380
And please,

307
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,300
tell them that always,

308
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:59,180
when I shut my eyes

309
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,260
and I pray to God

310
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:05,210
I beseech Him
to let me see my mother

311
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,580
and my father

312
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,900
and my brothers,

313
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,700
when I open my eyes...

314
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:18,900
- Do you want me to pray with you?
- Yes, please.

315
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,980
<i>Glory to God on high.</i>

316
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:34,010
<i>And on earth peace
to men of good will.</i>

317
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:38,010
<i>We praise You, we bless You,
we adore You, we glorify You.</i>

318
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:41,130
<i>We give You thanks
for Your great Glory.</i>

319
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:45,610
<i>O Lord God, heavenly King,
God the Father Almighty.</i>

320
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:48,970
<i>O Lord Jesus Christ,
the only- begotten Son.</i>

321
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:52,370
<i>O Lord Jesus Christ, Lord God,
Lamb of God...</i>

322
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,980
Very good, Inés.

323
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,100
I'll take care of you.

324
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:00,460
It's all right, it's all right.

325
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,370
- Hello! Welcome.
- Tomás!

326
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,130
<i>- Gracias, Padre.
- Thank you, Jose.</i>

327
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:15,050
- How are you, Francisco?
- I'm very well, thank you.

328
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,500
Father Lorenzo.

329
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:21,570
It's a great honor for me to welcome
you in my house, Father Lorenzo.

330
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:24,450
This way, please.
These are my sons.

331
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:26,380
Ángel... and Álvaro.

332
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,380
Hello, Ángel.

333
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:32,060
And this is my dear wife...

334
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,220
María Isabel.

335
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:38,260
Father Lorenzo,

336
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,730
welcome to our house.

337
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:42,900
- Thank you.
- Please.

338
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,660
Francisco, thank you.

339
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:49,170
The time has come for me
to repay

340
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:51,290
the Lord
for all his kindness

341
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:55,220
by restoring the Convent
of Saint Tomás.

342
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:58,780
You know,
Tomás being my own name,

343
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:11,580
I'm very sorry that my daughter
cannot dine with us tonight.

344
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,320
A most...

345
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:17,700
a most marvelous work indeed,
Goya.

346
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:18,880
Thank you.

347
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,290
As I was saying,

348
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:25,010
the time has come for me to repay
the Lord for all His kindness

349
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:28,940
by restoring the Convent
of Saint Tomás.

350
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:34,500
<i>Bless us, o Lord,</i>

351
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,820
<i>and your gifts,</i>

352
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:41,370
<i>which from your bounty we are about
to receive through Christ our Lord.</i>

353
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,480
Amen.

354
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:52,380
To the successful restoration
of the Convent of Saint Tomás.

355
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:58,170
This wine is excellent.

356
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:02,370
It was aged on a ship that has gone
twice around the world.

357
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,650
It takes constant motion

358
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:07,050
to bring out the flavor
in this particular wine.

359
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:09,010
I didn't know that.

360
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:12,620
And these are anchovies
from Santoña.

361
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:16,930
I presume that you're anxious
to have some news of your daughter.

362
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,040
Oh, yes,

363
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:19,940
extremely so.

364
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:23,770
She has never ever been away.
Did you see her?

365
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:24,980
Yes, I did.

366
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:26,900
How is she?

367
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:30,340
She's in fine spirits

368
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:34,140
and sends her love
to all of you.

369
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:37,290
When can we expect her home?

370
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:41,130
I couldn't say.
She must first stand trial.

371
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,340
Stand trial?

372
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,520
Why?

373
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,770
For what she has confessed.

374
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,860
What did she confess?

375
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:54,170
That she had secretly practiced

376
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:56,290
the Jewish rituals
of her forbears.

377
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,460
But that's impossible.

378
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:03,930
We are an old Christian family.

379
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:06,340
Correct me if I'm wrong

380
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:09,490
but the Brothers in charge
of the archives...

381
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:13,530
informed me that your
grandmother's great- grandfather

382
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:16,810
converted from Judaism to
Christianity when he came to Spain

383
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:19,060
from Amsterdam in 1624.

384
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:22,420
Is that true?

385
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,520
Yes.

386
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:31,050
But I am the only person
in the family who knows that.

387
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:34,290
Then why has your daughter
confessed to it?

388
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:38,170
Inés couldn't possibly confess to
something she has no knowledge of.

389
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,280
Excuse me,

390
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:42,730
was my sister put
to 'The Question'?

391
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,100
Yes, she was.

392
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,700
My daughter was tortured?

393
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:50,810
She was put to 'The Question'.

394
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:53,050
I thought that kind
of 'investigation'

395
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:55,610
had been abandoned years ago.

396
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:56,900
Yes, it was,

397
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:02,090
but now
in these troubled times,

398
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:05,650
in its quest for the truth,
the Church is bringing it back.

399
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:06,760
So...

400
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:11,250
you maintain that a confession
obtained by the means of

401
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:16,210
as you call it 'The Question'
is valid proof of anything?

402
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:19,890
This is not an opinion
of one simple monk, sir.

403
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,850
It is a tenet of Church
teaching that a confession

404
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:27,810
attained by 'The Question'
constitutes ultimate proof.

405
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,740
I'm sorry, Lorenzo,

406
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:33,450
but how can this sort
of confession be an ultimate proof?

407
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:36,890
If I were tortured, I'd confess
to anything.

408
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,090
I'd confess
I was the Turkish sultan.

409
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,770
No, you wouldn't.

410
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:44,130
I would confess to anything
to avoid pain.

411
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,900
No, you wouldn't.

412
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:50,610
You're a God- fearing man, Goya,
aren't you?

413
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,220
Of course I am.

414
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:56,730
So, your fear of God would prevent
you from making a false confession.

415
00:35:56,840 --> 00:36:00,130
But what ifthe pain obscured
my senses?

416
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:03,050
What if my fear of pain
became bigger

417
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:05,140
than my fear of God?

418
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:08,690
If you are innocent of the charge,
God will give you the strength

419
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,770
to withstand the pain.

420
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,450
- Are you sure of that?
- Yes.

421
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,650
Forgive me, Father Lorenzo,

422
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:19,340
but have you ever been
put to the...

423
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:22,540
to 'The Question' yourself?

424
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:26,170
- Have I ever been?
- Yes.

425
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:29,850
Have you ever been subjected
to 'The Question'?

426
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:31,300
Of course not.

427
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:34,290
Do you think that if you were

428
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,650
and they asked you to confess

429
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:39,300
something grotesquely absurd,

430
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:40,720
say...

431
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:46,740
say you were told to confess that
you are really a monke...

432
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,250
are you sure that God

433
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:52,850
would grant you the fortitude
to deny it?

434
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,570
Or would you rather confess
to being a monkey

435
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,420
to avoid the pain?

436
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,020
I know I would.

437
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:02,180
I know you would.
So would I.

438
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:05,880
Would you?

439
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:14,250
What is this? Are you playing some
sort of silly game with your guest?

440
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:18,450
Nobody would ever ask Father Lorenzo
to confess something so absurd.

441
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,560
I would.

442
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:40,780
- Is he serious?
- Oh, I'm sure he's not.

443
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:43,420
Álvaro, go get your father.

444
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:50,610
Sometimes I don't understand
his humor.

445
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,820
Nobody does.

446
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:55,410
Because my father doesn't have
a sense of humor.

447
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,180
Oh, yes, he does.

448
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:02,810
- More wine?
- No, thank you.

449
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:03,920
Francisco?

450
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:14,500
"I, Lorenzo Casamares,

451
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:19,850
hereby confess that, contrary
to my human appearance,

452
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,140
am, in fact,

453
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:25,290
the bastard son of a chimpanzee
and an orangutan

454
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:28,730
and I have schemed
to join the Church in order

455
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:31,860
to do harm to the Holy Office."

456
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:48,160
Sign it.

457
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:55,340
This is a joke, Tomás, right?

458
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,320
Sign it.

459
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,860
Ángel, block the door.

460
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:15,610
Francisco, escort me out
of this house.

461
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,220
Stop Senor Goya.

462
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:24,210
- Are you crazy?
- Francisco, please stay out of this.

463
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,650
- Let us go.
- You can go.

464
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:30,290
What do you mean I can go?
And Father Lorenzo?

465
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,940
Did he let my daughter go?

466
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:37,740
Did you let my innocent daughter
go?

467
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,160
Did he?

468
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:44,540
Keep him here.
Let Senor Goya go.

469
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,500
Release him!

470
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:51,700
<i>Escort Señor Goya out.</i>

471
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,160
Tomás!

472
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:57,850
Take your hands off me!
This is outrageous.

473
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:01,540
Are you ready to sign
the confession?

474
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,140
María Isabel.

475
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:35,500
Bring him here.

476
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,480
Sign it.

477
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,340
Tie his hands.

478
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:57,780
Will you sign?

479
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:06,120
All right.

480
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:08,770
Let's find out if God will give
you the strength

481
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:11,090
to resist 'The Question'.

482
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,380
Lift him up.

483
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,140
I will burn this paper

484
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:06,370
the moment
my daughter returns home.

485
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,940
But I won't wait forever.

486
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:11,900
You must understand that.

487
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,340
All right, you are free to go now.

488
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:29,580
Father Lorenzo?

489
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:32,740
You're forgetting something.

490
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:39,500
This might be of great help
to both of us.

491
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:55,140
This is a very generous
contribution, indeed.

492
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:59,300
We are grateful for your efforts,

493
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:01,140
Brother Lorenzo.

494
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:05,380
There is a request, Father.

495
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:07,500
There usually is.

496
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:10,820
Let us hear the particulars.

497
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:12,900
The merchant

498
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:16,450
would like
to have his daughter back.

499
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:20,140
- Is she with us?
- Yes, Father. Yes.

500
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:24,620
- What is her status?
- A Judaiser.

501
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:29,980
How did you respond
to this request?

502
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:33,660
I promised
to plead for her release.

503
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:38,740
- On what grounds?
- I took into consideration...

504
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:42,970
the size of the endowment as well
as the fact

505
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:45,300
that she is very young.

506
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:47,820
Did she confess?

507
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:49,780
Yes, Father.

508
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:53,540
She was put to 'The Question'.

509
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:59,490
We shall accept
this magnanimous gift

510
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:01,580
with humble gratitude.

511
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:06,970
We shall also carve the name
of the donor

512
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:10,650
in the Convent in stone
to commemorate

513
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:12,820
his generosity forever.

514
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,620
As for the daughter,

515
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:22,130
I will pray to the Lord He may
bestow His mercy on her.

516
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:25,530
Of course, releasing her would
contradict

517
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:28,290
the basic principles
of our faith,

518
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,810
because it would suggest
that the Church

519
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:34,260
doubts the power
of 'The Question'.

520
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:37,220
We are concluded.

521
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:52,490
- Did you see my parents?
Yes, I did, I did.

522
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:54,930
They are doing everything
they can to get you out.

523
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:56,040
And?

524
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
And...

525
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:04,340
they love you very much, Inés.

526
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:10,380
Shall we pray together, Inés?

527
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:40,940
I can't believe it.

528
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:44,860
"I am, in fact,
the bastard son

529
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:48,380
of a chimpanzee
and an orangutan...

530
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:51,780
Can you believe this idiot?

531
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:54,060
He's crazy.

532
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:58,340
Your Majesty,

533
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:01,340
I am a desperate father

534
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:05,970
and this was done only to prove
that, if put to 'The Question'

535
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:08,570
even the most innocent man
of cloth

536
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:13,300
will confess to the most
preposterous absurdities.

537
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:16,320
Yes.

538
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:19,650
We beg you, Your Majesty,
please use your authority

539
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:22,620
to restore our daughter to us.

540
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:26,780
Yes,
I will see what I can do for her.

541
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:31,770
I had a good look at the signature.

542
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:36,260
- There can be no mistake?
- It is Lorenzo's.

543
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:40,010
Where is Brother Lorenzo?

544
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:44,500
All the brothers are looking
for him, Father).

545
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:49,850
- Yes?
- Francisco Goya y Lucientes?

546
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:51,460
At your service.

547
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:53,770
We have been told
that you are painting

548
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:55,930
a portrait
of Lorenzo Casamares.

549
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:57,940
Yes, please come in.

550
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:00,810
It's already finished.
This way.

551
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:02,770
I hope Father Lorenzo

552
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:07,420
is pleased with the frame
we've chosen for it.

553
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:11,890
Lorenzo Casamares
disgraced himself

554
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,290
and he is now a fugitive.

555
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:15,420
A fugitive?

556
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:17,160
I see.

557
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:21,260
We're here to confiscate
the portrait.

558
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:23,620
Yes, of course.

559
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:28,010
If he were to contact you,

560
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:30,490
we would like
to be notified immediately.

561
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:32,020
Well, certainly.

562
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:37,380
Oh, incidentally,

563
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:43,610
I have not yet been paid
for the painting.

564
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:47,060
If we find him,
we'll remind him.

565
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:29,620
As the image of the man

566
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,300
vanishes into thin air...

567
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:36,820
may his name forever vanish

568
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:38,460
from all memory.

569
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:42,420
Whosoever pronounces his name

570
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:46,300
may he burn in the fires

571
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:48,500
of eternal damnation.

572
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:33,970
She will like this frame.
You've done beautiful work.

573
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:37,530
I've never been this close
to our Queen.

574
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:40,580
But... is she really that ugly?

575
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:44,610
What's your point?
It's a beautiful painting.

576
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:49,180
Yes, but that does not make
a Queen beautiful.

577
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:42,410
<i>Don Francisco,</i>

578
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:48,180
Her Majesty wishes for you
to go to His Majesty's chamber.

579
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:02,780
Please, sit.

580
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:06,740
Sit, please.

581
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:09,220
Please, sit

582
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:07,330
How did you like it?

583
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:10,650
Very much, Your Majesty.
Very much.

584
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:15,010
- Are you telling me the truth?
- I am, I am. I was very...

585
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:16,940
moved, Your Majesty.

586
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:18,370
Not now.

587
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:21,650
Do you know
who composed that piece?

588
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:23,740
No, not really, sire.

589
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:28,620
Mozart, maybe? No.

590
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:32,320
Händel?

591
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:36,500
- I did.
- Really?

592
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:41,570
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

593
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:45,900
Excellent and beautifully
performed. performed.

594
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:48,930
- So much for art.
- Now, sire,

595
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:52,730
I wonder if I could have
your opinion on my...

596
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:54,660
All right, come in.

597
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:04,420
Your Majesty...
I have come from Paris.

598
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,580
The French rabble

599
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:10,570
has decapitated the King
of France.

600
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:12,500
The King of France?

601
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:15,530
Yes, Your Majesty.
King Louis.

602
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:18,690
He was guillotined
in a public execution

603
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:20,060
six days ago.

604
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:23,020
My cousin Louis?

605
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:24,880
Yes, sire.

606
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:51,970
15 YEARS LATER

607
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:55,370
Our soldiers must comprehend
the noble purpose of their mission.

608
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:58,650
They carry a personal message
from me, Napoleon Bonaparte,

609
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:02,130
that I will not stand by
and watch our Spanish neighbors

610
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:04,450
continue to suffer the tyranny

611
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:06,650
of corrupt and decadent kings,

612
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:09,850
repressive clergy
and foreign imposters.

613
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:13,010
Yes, the King of Spain
is not even Spanish.

614
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:15,330
He is French.
And the Queen of Spain...

615
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:16,860
She is Italian!

616
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:21,330
No wonder the Spanish people
hate the Royal Family

617
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:25,020
as much as they hate
the Inquisition.

618
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:27,260
You have never fought

619
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:30,260
an easier campaign, soldiers!

620
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:34,570
The common folk will greet you
with flowers and kisses

621
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:36,970
on the streets of Madrid!

622
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:40,690
The Spaniard cannot wait
to break his chains

623
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:42,940
and become a free man.

624
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:45,900
Long live Napoleon.

625
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:55,330
<i>I can see these explosions
but I can't hear them.</i>

626
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:56,440
<i>I'm deaf.</i>

627
00:55:57,480 --> 00:56:01,370
<i>I am completely deaf now,
but every morning</i>

628
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:05,250
<i>I thank the Lord that
He hasn't taken my sight away</i>

629
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:07,810
<i>that I've been able to witness</i>

630
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:11,740
<i>and record
what has been happening here.</i>

631
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:18,900
<i>These are French soldiers.</i>

632
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:20,380
<i>The Mamelukes.</i>

633
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:24,170
<i>Special cavalry recruited
from Egypt by Napoleon</i>

634
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:26,420
<i>to help liberate Spain.</i>

635
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:31,450
<i>To bring us the noble ideas
of the French Revolution.</i>

636
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:32,560
<i>Liberty,</i>

637
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:34,200
<i>equality,</i>

638
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:35,540
<i>brotherhood.</i>

639
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:40,570
<i>Then to defend the ideas
of the Revolution</i>

640
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:43,780
<i>Napoleon, this scourge of royalty,</i>

641
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:48,210
<i>made his own brother,
Joseph, the King of Spain.</i>

642
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:50,370
<i>But to my fellow Spaniard,</i>

643
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:54,690
<i>Napoleon's armies are nothing
but foreign invaders,</i>

644
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:55,800
<i>occupiers.</i>

645
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:17,700
Who is in command
of this place?

646
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:21,200
God

647
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:24,340
is in command of this

648
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:29,300
and every other place
on this earth, my son.

649
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:33,650
- In the name of Emperor Napoleon...
- Continue.

650
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:37,340
...and by the letter
of the Rights...

651
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,500
Brother? Brother?

652
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:55,260
Brothers, give him air,
let him breathe here.
