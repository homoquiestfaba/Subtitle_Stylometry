1
00:00:08,468 --> 00:00:10,971
(lion roaring)

2
00:00:17,185 --> 00:00:20,814
(pleasant orchestral music)

3
00:01:42,812 --> 00:01:44,981
- [Patou] Once upon a time,

4
00:01:44,981 --> 00:01:49,069
back before I knew how to tie
my shoes, the sun came up.

5
00:01:53,114 --> 00:01:55,408
Now, I know an everyday sunrise

6
00:01:55,408 --> 00:01:59,079
may not seem like such a
big deal to some folks.

7
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:01,372
But, imagine for a moment,

8
00:02:01,372 --> 00:02:04,167
if instead of rising up like this,

9
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,213
one morning where you lived,

10
00:02:08,213 --> 00:02:12,342
she took a look around and
decided to go back to sleep.

11
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:15,386
It happened once to us.

12
00:02:16,304 --> 00:02:18,681
Let me tell you all about it.

13
00:02:25,146 --> 00:02:28,066
♫ Cock-a-doo

14
00:02:28,066 --> 00:02:30,318
♫ Hoo hoo hoo hoo

15
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:32,195
♫ Whoa

16
00:02:33,404 --> 00:02:36,449
♫ Ohdeohdelayhee hee

17
00:02:37,742 --> 00:02:40,286
♫ Cock-a-doo, what a day

18
00:02:40,286 --> 00:02:41,913
♫ The sun is shining brightly

19
00:02:41,913 --> 00:02:44,124
♫ Cock-a-doo, sunny day

20
00:02:44,124 --> 00:02:46,126
♫ Down here on the farm

21
00:02:46,126 --> 00:02:48,128
♫ Cock-a-doo, stay away

22
00:02:48,128 --> 00:02:50,004
♫ You big ol' wet ol' rain cloud

23
00:02:50,004 --> 00:02:51,339
♫ Or I'll cry out loud

24
00:02:51,339 --> 00:02:54,801
♫ With this voice of mine

25
00:02:56,344 --> 00:02:58,721
- [Patou] This was our
rooster, Chanticleer.

26
00:02:58,721 --> 00:03:02,100
And though it was true that
he like to horse around some,

27
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,644
fact was, that boy could sing.

28
00:03:04,644 --> 00:03:05,478
♫ Sun do shine

29
00:03:05,478 --> 00:03:08,148
♫ Sun do shine, sun do shine, sun do shine

30
00:03:08,148 --> 00:03:10,316
♫ Well, my daddy taught me how to sing,

31
00:03:10,316 --> 00:03:12,777
♫ And that's why this
voice means everything

32
00:03:12,777 --> 00:03:14,195
♫ Sun do shine

33
00:03:14,195 --> 00:03:16,030
- [Patou] We all had our jobs on the farm,

34
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:19,159
and Chanticleer's was to wake up the sun.

35
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:21,786
And when he crowed, up she came.

36
00:03:22,787 --> 00:03:24,497
♫ Let it shine, let it shine

37
00:03:24,497 --> 00:03:25,582
♫ Let it shine

38
00:03:25,582 --> 00:03:27,333
- [Patou] Hey, look,
here's me tying my shoes.

39
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:29,002
- Hi, Patou, what you doin'?

40
00:03:29,002 --> 00:03:32,005
- I'm trying to tie these doggone shoes.

41
00:03:32,005 --> 00:03:33,131
- (laughs) Again?

42
00:03:33,131 --> 00:03:34,007
(chickens clucking)

43
00:03:34,007 --> 00:03:35,258
Well, hi ladies.

44
00:03:35,258 --> 00:03:37,135
- Oh, he's so handsome.

45
00:03:38,261 --> 00:03:40,096
- [Hen In Polka Dots] Sings like a dream.

46
00:03:40,096 --> 00:03:41,264
- He's a dream.

47
00:03:41,264 --> 00:03:43,141
- And he's single, too.

48
00:03:45,476 --> 00:03:47,645
- [Patou] He maybe wasn't the
smartest bird that ever lived,

49
00:03:47,645 --> 00:03:51,357
but when he crowed, there was
plenty of peace and harmony.

50
00:03:51,357 --> 00:03:52,400
- Hey!

51
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,528
- [Patou] Well, plenty of harmony, anyway.

52
00:03:55,528 --> 00:03:57,488
And lots of sunshine.

53
00:03:57,488 --> 00:03:59,032
♫ Well, my daddy taught me how to sing

54
00:03:59,032 --> 00:04:01,659
♫ And that's why this
voice means everything

55
00:04:01,659 --> 00:04:05,330
♫ Sun do shine, you
better shine, better shine

56
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:08,166
♫ Well, the sun do shine, you better shine

57
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:15,381
♫ You better shine

58
00:04:15,381 --> 00:04:19,510
♫ You better shine, sun, you better shine

59
00:04:24,265 --> 00:04:26,976
♫ Digidigidigidowdow

60
00:04:26,976 --> 00:04:29,187
(laughing)

61
00:04:31,231 --> 00:04:33,691
- [Patou] There was no doubt about it.

62
00:04:33,691 --> 00:04:37,695
Old Chanticleer kept us
animals up and shining.

63
00:04:37,695 --> 00:04:39,239
- [All] Good day, Mr. Chanticleer.

64
00:04:39,239 --> 00:04:41,658
- [Patou] But all that
was about to change.

65
00:04:41,658 --> 00:04:45,078
One morning, before
Chanticleer was even awake.

66
00:04:45,078 --> 00:04:46,079
- Hey, Chanticleer.

67
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:47,997
- [Patou] A stranger snuck onto our farm

68
00:04:47,997 --> 00:04:50,625
to stop Chanticleer from crowing.

69
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:53,711
Of course, Chanticleer wouldn't
give up without a fight.

70
00:04:53,711 --> 00:04:55,421
But what he didn't know

71
00:04:55,421 --> 00:04:57,632
was that this stranger had been sent

72
00:04:57,632 --> 00:04:59,759
by the Grand Duke of Owls.

73
00:05:00,885 --> 00:05:01,844
Nasty fella.

74
00:05:03,346 --> 00:05:05,556
(grunting)

75
00:05:07,517 --> 00:05:11,271
The good news here was that
Chanticleer had won the fight.

76
00:05:11,271 --> 00:05:13,439
The bad news was, the Grand Duke's bully

77
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:18,278
had done his dirty deed,
for in all the commotion

78
00:05:18,278 --> 00:05:21,239
Chanticleer had plum forgot to crow.

79
00:05:23,449 --> 00:05:27,078
And the sun was comin' up without him.

80
00:05:27,078 --> 00:05:28,955
(gasping)

81
00:05:28,955 --> 00:05:32,834
When Chanticleer saw
this, it broke his heart.

82
00:05:32,834 --> 00:05:36,963
He reckoned maybe his crow
never did raise the sun.

83
00:05:38,214 --> 00:05:41,884
- Look, it's comin' up without him.

84
00:05:41,884 --> 00:05:43,261
- You're a phony.

85
00:05:43,261 --> 00:05:45,221
- He's a fake!

86
00:05:45,221 --> 00:05:47,181
- Hey, everybody, cock-a-doodle-doo!

87
00:05:47,181 --> 00:05:48,683
(laughing)

88
00:05:48,683 --> 00:05:51,436
- [Patou] The Grand Duke's
evil plan had worked.

89
00:05:51,436 --> 00:05:55,398
He had turned us against
our very best friend.

90
00:05:55,398 --> 00:05:58,943
And without a reason to
crow, poor Chanticleer

91
00:05:58,943 --> 00:06:03,364
left the farm to look
for work in the city.

92
00:06:03,364 --> 00:06:07,493
Then came the rain, and
our troubles with the Duke.

93
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:15,251
- [Edmond] Who's that, Mom?

94
00:06:15,251 --> 00:06:17,003
- That's the Grand Duke.

95
00:06:17,003 --> 00:06:20,006
He's the one who's
causing all the trouble.

96
00:06:20,006 --> 00:06:21,799
He sent that mean old rooster

97
00:06:21,799 --> 00:06:24,427
to Chanticleer's farm to pick a fight.

98
00:06:24,427 --> 00:06:25,595
- Hm, how come?

99
00:06:26,721 --> 00:06:29,932
- Because he didn't like
Chanticleer doing all that crowing

100
00:06:29,932 --> 00:06:31,601
and bringing up the sun.

101
00:06:31,601 --> 00:06:32,477
- How come?

102
00:06:33,561 --> 00:06:37,690
- Well, like most owls, he
likes the darkness and the rain.

103
00:06:41,277 --> 00:06:42,695
- I'm not afraid of the dark.

104
00:06:42,695 --> 00:06:44,864
(gasps)

105
00:06:44,864 --> 00:06:46,866
- Oh, it's you.

106
00:06:46,866 --> 00:06:48,242
You scared me!

107
00:06:48,242 --> 00:06:50,203
- Dory, we got big problems.

108
00:06:50,203 --> 00:06:51,496
Have you looked out there?

109
00:06:51,496 --> 00:06:52,413
If that rain doesn't stop,

110
00:06:52,413 --> 00:06:53,915
we're all gonna go
floatin' down the river.

111
00:06:53,915 --> 00:06:55,958
- [Patou] This is my
favorite part of the story.

112
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:57,335
His name is Edmond, of course

113
00:06:57,335 --> 00:07:00,088
he didn't look quite like
this when I first met him.

114
00:07:00,088 --> 00:07:03,424
Anyhow, we weren't the only
folks having our troubles.

115
00:07:03,424 --> 00:07:06,969
Poor Edmond's family was
having their share too.

116
00:07:06,969 --> 00:07:07,929
- [Father] The river's widened too fast,

117
00:07:07,929 --> 00:07:09,639
we gotta reinforce the sandbags.

118
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:10,765
- [Mother] Oh, you think that'll work?

119
00:07:10,765 --> 00:07:12,058
- [Father] We'll make it work.

120
00:07:12,058 --> 00:07:12,892
I'll get the boys.

121
00:07:12,892 --> 00:07:13,726
- Me too!

122
00:07:13,726 --> 00:07:15,937
- You stop right there.

123
00:07:15,937 --> 00:07:18,064
- Aw Mom, I'm one of the boys.

124
00:07:18,064 --> 00:07:19,816
- He meant the big boys.

125
00:07:19,816 --> 00:07:21,109
- I'm big enough.

126
00:07:21,109 --> 00:07:22,985
- Not yet you're not, darling.

127
00:07:22,985 --> 00:07:24,737
- [Radio] The U.S. Weather
Bureau is expecting

128
00:07:24,737 --> 00:07:25,613
yet another--

129
00:07:25,613 --> 00:07:26,781
(static)

130
00:07:26,781 --> 00:07:30,076
Downpour in the areas worst
hit by this week's flooding.

131
00:07:30,076 --> 00:07:31,577
- [Older Boy] Dad, Mom, come on,

132
00:07:31,577 --> 00:07:33,246
bring the stuff around to the front.

133
00:07:33,246 --> 00:07:34,372
- [Radio] Governor Dale declared

134
00:07:34,372 --> 00:07:35,915
a state of national emergency--

135
00:07:35,915 --> 00:07:37,083
- Come on, guys, move it.

136
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:38,793
I need some help, we've
gotta get the animals inside.

137
00:07:38,793 --> 00:07:40,044
- [Patou] So while Scott and Mark

138
00:07:40,044 --> 00:07:42,630
got to help protect the
house against the flood,

139
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:44,298
poor Edmond was left behind where

140
00:07:44,298 --> 00:07:47,135
he'd be safe and out of trouble.

141
00:07:47,135 --> 00:07:49,387
- It's my house too, I wanna help.

142
00:07:49,387 --> 00:07:52,432
- Well then, pray for the rain
to stop, and that'll help.

143
00:07:52,432 --> 00:07:53,474
- [Father] Dory, I can't
find the flashlight!

144
00:07:53,474 --> 00:07:54,725
- Coming!

145
00:07:54,725 --> 00:07:56,269
Now you stay here where
it's safe, pumpkin.

146
00:07:56,269 --> 00:07:58,271
I'm gonna help your father
and I'll be right back.

147
00:07:58,271 --> 00:07:59,105
- [Older Boy] Come on, dad.

148
00:07:59,105 --> 00:08:00,314
- [Father] Great, let's go!

149
00:08:00,314 --> 00:08:01,190
- Hey Dad, they said on the radio

150
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:02,733
the National Guard might come.

151
00:08:02,733 --> 00:08:04,444
- I am too a big boy.

152
00:08:11,075 --> 00:08:15,788
"And without a reason to crow,
Chanticleer left the farm.

153
00:08:15,788 --> 00:08:17,498
"Then came the rain."

154
00:08:19,584 --> 00:08:21,711
(thunder)

155
00:08:26,841 --> 00:08:27,800
- Mom, here!

156
00:08:32,638 --> 00:08:34,223
- How is she, Frank?

157
00:08:34,223 --> 00:08:38,019
- Just start the truck, she'll be okay.

158
00:08:38,019 --> 00:08:38,811
Hey, hey!

159
00:08:40,271 --> 00:08:41,647
- I know what we need here.

160
00:08:41,647 --> 00:08:43,691
We need Chanticleer.

161
00:08:43,691 --> 00:08:46,194
(thunder)

162
00:08:46,194 --> 00:08:48,779
(water rushing)

163
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:49,780
(gasps)

164
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:50,615
Mom!

165
00:08:50,615 --> 00:08:52,992
- Boys, the levee's breaking!

166
00:08:54,702 --> 00:08:55,828
- Chanticleer!

167
00:08:57,538 --> 00:08:58,498
Chanticleer!

168
00:08:59,749 --> 00:09:01,459
(explosion)

169
00:09:01,459 --> 00:09:04,545
- [Patou] Edmond had the right
idea to call for Chanticleer,

170
00:09:04,545 --> 00:09:08,549
but he never coulda guessed
who was gonna answer.

171
00:09:18,976 --> 00:09:21,771
(heavy footsteps)

172
00:09:24,315 --> 00:09:25,942
- Chanticleer?

173
00:09:25,942 --> 00:09:28,152
- No, it's not Chanticleer.

174
00:09:30,613 --> 00:09:31,906
- Who...

175
00:09:31,906 --> 00:09:33,366
Who are you?

176
00:09:33,366 --> 00:09:37,495
- You put your finger in
the Duke's face, remember?

177
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,707
These are expensive, brat!

178
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:47,171
But that is not why the
Duke is going to eat you.

179
00:09:48,673 --> 00:09:49,966
- Eat me?

180
00:09:49,966 --> 00:09:53,010
- Oh dear, now I've gone
and spoiled the surprise.

181
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:54,804
Oh, always doing that.

182
00:09:56,472 --> 00:09:59,850
But you see, we creatures of the night

183
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:03,563
have worked very hard
to make absolutely sure

184
00:10:05,356 --> 00:10:07,900
that that bird does not return.

185
00:10:09,569 --> 00:10:13,698
You, you, with no regard
for the feelings of others,

186
00:10:15,116 --> 00:10:18,744
had the nerve to call
him back here by name!

187
00:10:20,871 --> 00:10:24,750
And besides, I positively
loathe rock and roll.

188
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:30,339
(laughing maniacally)

189
00:10:30,339 --> 00:10:31,632
- You're not gonna eat me!

190
00:10:31,632 --> 00:10:34,427
- [Patou] And that's when
the Duke hit the ceiling.

191
00:10:34,427 --> 00:10:37,638
If Edmond wanted to bring
Chanticleer back to raise the sun,

192
00:10:37,638 --> 00:10:41,225
the Duke was gonna have
somethin' to say about it.

193
00:10:41,225 --> 00:10:43,686
- Kittens are more digestible.

194
00:10:45,104 --> 00:10:46,480
- [Patou] Young Edmond was about to have

195
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,443
the most amazing adventure
he'd ever dreamed of.

196
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,989
(yowling)

197
00:10:54,989 --> 00:10:57,575
(evil laughter)

198
00:11:12,798 --> 00:11:14,675
- Mom, Dad, wake me up!

199
00:11:15,718 --> 00:11:17,720
- [Patou] This is where I come in.

200
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,554
(chomp)

201
00:11:18,554 --> 00:11:20,681
(yelling)

202
00:11:22,558 --> 00:11:25,019
- You'll pay for this, Patou!

203
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:26,437
This does not concern you.

204
00:11:26,437 --> 00:11:28,105
- It does if it's about Chant--

205
00:11:28,105 --> 00:11:31,150
- The light, the owls hate the light!

206
00:11:33,861 --> 00:11:36,489
(+screams)

207
00:11:38,949 --> 00:11:39,742
- Whew.

208
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:41,952
Hey, hey boy.

209
00:11:43,412 --> 00:11:44,955
We were this close.

210
00:11:46,207 --> 00:11:50,002
Oh, that flashlight biz was
quick thinking on your part.

211
00:11:50,002 --> 00:11:51,629
What's your name, little fella?

212
00:11:51,629 --> 00:11:53,214
- Edmond.

213
00:11:53,214 --> 00:11:54,131
Is he gone?

214
00:11:54,131 --> 00:11:55,633
- Yeah, he's gone, but he'll be back

215
00:11:55,633 --> 00:11:57,843
and he won't be alone, the coward.

216
00:11:57,843 --> 00:12:01,597
I woulda whopped him if
I'da had my shoes tied.

217
00:12:01,597 --> 00:12:03,599
But you know something, tying shoes

218
00:12:03,599 --> 00:12:05,935
is harder than dry dog food.

219
00:12:05,935 --> 00:12:07,937
- Whatcha wearing shoes for?

220
00:12:07,937 --> 00:12:09,188
- Bunions.

221
00:12:09,188 --> 00:12:13,317
I got a load of bunions,
and them shoes help my feet.

222
00:12:14,318 --> 00:12:17,071
- Here, let me show you how to tie 'em.

223
00:12:17,071 --> 00:12:18,072
(gasps)

224
00:12:18,072 --> 00:12:19,949
Jeepers, I'm all furry!

225
00:12:20,825 --> 00:12:22,284
- Well, kittens are furry.

226
00:12:22,284 --> 00:12:25,204
- But, but, I'm a little boy.

227
00:12:25,204 --> 00:12:26,622
(yowling scream)

228
00:12:26,622 --> 00:12:27,748
(gulp)

229
00:12:27,748 --> 00:12:29,625
Did that come outta me?

230
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:34,213
I'm, I'm a cat, he turned me into a cat!

231
00:12:34,213 --> 00:12:36,090
Help me, do something!

232
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:38,592
I can't be a cat, I'm a boy!

233
00:12:38,592 --> 00:12:39,927
Patou, what'll I do?

234
00:12:39,927 --> 00:12:42,763
- Alright, steady boy, keep your pants on.

235
00:12:42,763 --> 00:12:44,724
(gasps)

236
00:12:54,817 --> 00:12:55,901
- Yuck!

237
00:12:55,901 --> 00:12:58,904
What am I doing, I'm licking myself.

238
00:12:58,904 --> 00:13:01,949
(sniffing)

239
00:13:01,949 --> 00:13:02,825
- [Peepers] Patou!

240
00:13:02,825 --> 00:13:03,951
- I'm in here.

241
00:13:06,662 --> 00:13:10,458
- By my calculations, this
can't possibly be the city.

242
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:12,752
Let's see. 367 southeast...

243
00:13:15,838 --> 00:13:16,881
Or is it 676?

244
00:13:18,507 --> 00:13:20,301
(gasps)

245
00:13:20,301 --> 00:13:21,927
(laughing)

246
00:13:21,927 --> 00:13:25,055
- It's okay Peepers, it's Edmond.

247
00:13:25,055 --> 00:13:26,432
He's a nice kitty.

248
00:13:26,432 --> 00:13:27,641
- I'm a boy!

249
00:13:27,641 --> 00:13:29,268
And I almost ate a mouse.

250
00:13:29,268 --> 00:13:30,686
I must be crazy.

251
00:13:30,686 --> 00:13:33,689
- You bet your sweet whiskers.

252
00:13:33,689 --> 00:13:34,482
- Wow.

253
00:13:36,275 --> 00:13:37,359
- Ain't no city around here.

254
00:13:37,359 --> 00:13:38,486
- Oh, sadness.

255
00:13:40,571 --> 00:13:43,157
- Hey, aren't you gonna tie my shoes?

256
00:13:43,157 --> 00:13:45,951
- I can't, I can't help anybody.

257
00:13:45,951 --> 00:13:47,161
I'm too little.

258
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,331
I'm a scrawny furball runt.

259
00:13:51,665 --> 00:13:55,002
Mom and Dad won't even recognize me!

260
00:13:55,002 --> 00:13:56,212
Mom, Dad, help!

261
00:13:57,922 --> 00:14:00,049
(thunder)

262
00:14:03,344 --> 00:14:05,513
Oh, Chanticleer.

263
00:14:05,513 --> 00:14:06,347
- What?

264
00:14:06,347 --> 00:14:08,349
- If he doesn't come back and crow soon,

265
00:14:08,349 --> 00:14:12,144
it won't shine again and the
rain will keep coming down

266
00:14:12,144 --> 00:14:13,938
and the water will get higher and higher

267
00:14:13,938 --> 00:14:15,773
'til, 'til...

268
00:14:15,773 --> 00:14:16,816
We all drown.

269
00:14:19,068 --> 00:14:21,612
- Wowie wow wow wow wow!

270
00:14:21,612 --> 00:14:23,155
Are we close, are we near the city?

271
00:14:23,155 --> 00:14:24,907
Us magpies are just made for the city.

272
00:14:24,907 --> 00:14:25,991
Come on already, hurry up, Peepers!

273
00:14:25,991 --> 00:14:28,285
- We are not looking for the city.

274
00:14:28,285 --> 00:14:30,454
We are looking for Chanticleer.

275
00:14:30,454 --> 00:14:32,456
- Well he's in the city, isn't he?

276
00:14:32,456 --> 00:14:33,791
- Then he is in the city.

277
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:35,376
- Girls, they think they know everything.

278
00:14:35,376 --> 00:14:37,545
Why don't you run home, be
a mousewife, make cheese.

279
00:14:37,545 --> 00:14:40,339
- Snipes, you think you're so superior.

280
00:14:40,339 --> 00:14:41,173
- "Thuperior."

281
00:14:41,173 --> 00:14:42,007
Nice lisp.

282
00:14:42,007 --> 00:14:44,969
- My lisp isolates and elevates me,

283
00:14:44,969 --> 00:14:47,096
and makes me a rare specimen.

284
00:14:47,096 --> 00:14:48,472
- Ah, this is flippin' garbage!

285
00:14:48,472 --> 00:14:50,349
(arguing)

286
00:14:50,349 --> 00:14:51,851
- Pipe down, you two.

287
00:14:51,851 --> 00:14:53,310
- The story's true!

288
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:55,855
You all laughed at him and he went away.

289
00:14:55,855 --> 00:14:57,147
- You're right, son.

290
00:14:57,147 --> 00:15:00,985
We done wrong, and that's why
we're searchin' for the city.

291
00:15:00,985 --> 00:15:03,612
We gotta find Chanti and apologize.

292
00:15:03,612 --> 00:15:05,072
- Then he'll forgive us...

293
00:15:05,072 --> 00:15:05,865
- Come home...

294
00:15:05,865 --> 00:15:07,449
- [Chicks] And raise the sun!

295
00:15:07,449 --> 00:15:09,702
- Well, I know where the city is.

296
00:15:09,702 --> 00:15:11,787
I've been there lots of times as a boy.

297
00:15:11,787 --> 00:15:12,621
- A boy?

298
00:15:12,621 --> 00:15:15,708
- Before that big owl
turned me into a cat!

299
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:16,542
- Owl?

300
00:15:16,542 --> 00:15:17,877
(snorts) Owl?

301
00:15:17,877 --> 00:15:21,171
- Edmond, would you take us to the city?

302
00:15:21,171 --> 00:15:21,964
- I can't.

303
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:25,301
Look at me, I'm a cat.

304
00:15:25,301 --> 00:15:27,011
No, a little kitty.

305
00:15:27,011 --> 00:15:28,137
What can I do?

306
00:15:30,222 --> 00:15:33,392
- I can do lots of things, and
I'm a lot smaller than you.

307
00:15:33,392 --> 00:15:37,271
And furthermore, I could
forgive you for being a cat

308
00:15:37,271 --> 00:15:39,732
if you would take us to the city.

309
00:15:39,732 --> 00:15:41,150
Of course, if you're a fraidy-cat...

310
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:42,693
- I'm not afraid!

311
00:15:42,693 --> 00:15:44,695
- Or like, a scaredy-cat...

312
00:15:44,695 --> 00:15:46,572
- Me, scared?
- Hey, guys...

313
00:15:46,572 --> 00:15:48,324
- Lay off the boy.

314
00:15:48,324 --> 00:15:49,450
- Hey, hey guys...

315
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:50,409
- Okay, okay!

316
00:15:50,409 --> 00:15:52,328
I'm not afraid of anything.

317
00:15:52,328 --> 00:15:55,915
I'll take you to the city
and find Chanticleer.

318
00:15:55,915 --> 00:15:57,833
(animals laughing)

319
00:15:57,833 --> 00:16:02,630
And bring him home, and save
Dad and Mom and the farm.

320
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:05,966
- Alright, hope you can swim, guys.

321
00:16:05,966 --> 00:16:07,343
- [Edmond] Oh no!

322
00:16:09,511 --> 00:16:12,473
(coughing)

323
00:16:12,473 --> 00:16:14,725
We don't have to swim,

324
00:16:14,725 --> 00:16:16,060
we'll go by boat.

325
00:16:17,478 --> 00:16:19,980
- Oh, this is serious.

326
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:24,443
- Peepers, you'll need
this if those owls return.

327
00:16:24,443 --> 00:16:25,653
- Here!

328
00:16:25,653 --> 00:16:26,820
- Owls?

329
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,948
- I'm sticking with you.

330
00:16:28,948 --> 00:16:30,574
- Well fellas, this is it.

331
00:16:30,574 --> 00:16:31,617
(gulps)

332
00:16:31,617 --> 00:16:32,868
- [Snipes] The city!

333
00:16:32,868 --> 00:16:34,578
The lights, the chicks, the food.

334
00:16:34,578 --> 00:16:37,122
- Bye, good luck with the owls!

335
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:40,584
- Owls?

336
00:16:40,584 --> 00:16:42,795
(whimpers)

337
00:16:44,254 --> 00:16:45,798
(thunder)

338
00:16:45,798 --> 00:16:47,633
- [Patou] Yep, owls.

339
00:16:47,633 --> 00:16:52,346
While Edmond set our course
for the city in the USS Toybox,

340
00:16:52,346 --> 00:16:55,224
the Duke and his owls
were back in their lair

341
00:16:55,224 --> 00:16:57,977
stirrin' up some powerful nasty weather.

342
00:16:57,977 --> 00:17:00,771
(low organ music)

343
00:17:11,073 --> 00:17:13,659
- So he turns on the Duke, and with what

344
00:17:13,659 --> 00:17:16,578
do you suppose he turns on the Duke?

345
00:17:16,578 --> 00:17:17,871
- [All] What, Master?

346
00:17:17,871 --> 00:17:19,415
- A flashlight!

347
00:17:19,415 --> 00:17:20,749
♫ What a horrible thing to do

348
00:17:20,749 --> 00:17:22,376
♫ ♫ What a horrible thing to do

349
00:17:22,376 --> 00:17:24,628
♫ Thing to doooo

350
00:17:24,628 --> 00:17:27,131
- But then, when my back is turned,

351
00:17:27,131 --> 00:17:29,299
what four-legged flea-bitten louse

352
00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:30,634
comes sneaking through the window

353
00:17:30,634 --> 00:17:33,178
and has the nerve to bite me on the leg?

354
00:17:33,178 --> 00:17:35,639
♫ Who, who, who, who, who?

355
00:17:35,639 --> 00:17:36,932
- Who?
- Patou.

356
00:17:36,932 --> 00:17:37,766
(gasps)

357
00:17:37,766 --> 00:17:38,600
Yes!

358
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,770
♫ Patou, Patou

359
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:43,897
- Destroy the farm,
destroy the cat, the dog,

360
00:17:43,897 --> 00:17:45,274
or do you want the chicken back?

361
00:17:45,274 --> 00:17:46,316
♫ No, we hate the sun

362
00:17:46,316 --> 00:17:49,194
♫ The answer's noooo

363
00:17:49,194 --> 00:17:52,614
It'll make my leg feel so much better

364
00:17:52,614 --> 00:17:54,908
if that rooster never crows!

365
00:17:57,244 --> 00:18:01,081
(laughs maniacally)

366
00:18:01,081 --> 00:18:02,499
♫ We hate the sun

367
00:18:02,499 --> 00:18:03,375
♫ That much we know

368
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:04,460
Rain!

369
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:06,837
♫ We hate the rooster.
we'll never let it crow

370
00:18:06,837 --> 00:18:07,671
Never let him crow!

371
00:18:07,671 --> 00:18:09,048
♫ We hate the sun

372
00:18:09,048 --> 00:18:10,424
♫ From head to toe

373
00:18:10,424 --> 00:18:11,258
From head to toe!

374
00:18:11,258 --> 00:18:15,929
♫ We hate the rooster,
we'll never let it crow.

375
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:18,891
♫ Never let it crow

376
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:24,938
Never let it crow.

377
00:18:24,938 --> 00:18:27,149
(crashing)

378
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:28,942
Aaahhh!

379
00:18:35,157 --> 00:18:36,408
- Uncle Dukey, Uncle Dukey.

380
00:18:36,408 --> 00:18:38,786
(yells)

381
00:18:38,786 --> 00:18:40,454
I wish you wouldn't do that.

382
00:18:40,454 --> 00:18:43,916
- Hunch, I told you never to call me that.

383
00:18:45,084 --> 00:18:46,210
- Yes, sir.

384
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:47,169
No sir, sir.

385
00:18:48,253 --> 00:18:49,630
But guess what I just saw,

386
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:52,174
Patou the dog floating in
a toybox down the river,

387
00:18:52,174 --> 00:18:53,926
and he has this cute little
white kitty with him--

388
00:18:53,926 --> 00:18:55,886
(yells)

389
00:18:57,387 --> 00:19:00,015
- Hunch, my little pygmy nephew.

390
00:19:03,852 --> 00:19:05,395
Come to your uncle.

391
00:19:07,606 --> 00:19:08,816
(jumbled organ notes)

392
00:19:08,816 --> 00:19:09,608
- Ah!

393
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:14,321
- [Patou] Meanwhile, bound for the city,

394
00:19:14,321 --> 00:19:17,950
Edmond steered us through the
perils of the flooded river.

395
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:19,827
- [Peepers] Starboard ho!

396
00:19:19,827 --> 00:19:20,786
- [Snipes] Starboard who?

397
00:19:20,786 --> 00:19:21,787
Left or right?

398
00:19:21,787 --> 00:19:23,705
- [Edmond] Uh-oh.

399
00:19:23,705 --> 00:19:27,751
Giant tree, a hundred feet and closing!

400
00:19:27,751 --> 00:19:29,378
- Jumpin' Jehosaphat!

401
00:19:29,378 --> 00:19:31,755
We need wind power!

402
00:19:31,755 --> 00:19:32,673
- 40 feet!

403
00:19:32,673 --> 00:19:35,217
- Well guys, I-I think
I'm slowing you down.

404
00:19:35,217 --> 00:19:36,760
Yeah, I'll see you later, guys.

405
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,303
- 30 feet!

406
00:19:38,303 --> 00:19:39,138
- Ahh!

407
00:19:39,138 --> 00:19:41,682
- Come on, Patou, pull on this.

408
00:19:45,894 --> 00:19:47,521
It worked!
- Turn now!

409
00:19:48,981 --> 00:19:51,275
(screaming)

410
00:19:52,609 --> 00:19:54,862
This is the right way, guys!

411
00:19:54,862 --> 00:19:58,991
(humming "Ride of the Valkyries")

412
00:20:02,661 --> 00:20:04,371
- Okay guys, you heard the Duke.

413
00:20:04,371 --> 00:20:07,666
Total and complete, oh-ho, annihilation.

414
00:20:09,751 --> 00:20:10,627
Bombs away!

415
00:20:12,087 --> 00:20:12,880
- Aah!

416
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:16,133
Hey!

417
00:20:16,133 --> 00:20:18,177
- Bombs away, bombs away!

418
00:20:19,595 --> 00:20:22,181
- Edmond, grab ahold!

419
00:20:22,181 --> 00:20:23,640
- Ooh ho ho, gotcha--

420
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,433
Oow!

421
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:26,643
- Get my camera!

422
00:20:27,561 --> 00:20:28,395
- Huh?

423
00:20:28,395 --> 00:20:30,355
What does he want with a camera?

424
00:20:30,355 --> 00:20:32,566
- Get that camera.

425
00:20:32,566 --> 00:20:33,859
- Ooh, I gotcha, kitty.

426
00:20:33,859 --> 00:20:34,985
- Put me down!

427
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:37,696
(growling)

428
00:20:37,696 --> 00:20:39,281
- Say cheese!

429
00:20:39,281 --> 00:20:40,407
- Oooh!

430
00:20:40,407 --> 00:20:42,451
- Ha ha, we got 'em.

431
00:20:42,451 --> 00:20:43,327
- Uh-oh...

432
00:20:46,663 --> 00:20:48,457
- Oh no!
- Get the lid.

433
00:20:52,669 --> 00:20:54,463
- Ahah, adequate pipe.

434
00:20:59,968 --> 00:21:01,762
- L-Let me outta here.

435
00:21:03,931 --> 00:21:05,265
I can't breathe!

436
00:21:05,265 --> 00:21:06,099
Help, I need air.

437
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:06,934
- What's wrong with him?

438
00:21:06,934 --> 00:21:08,393
- He's claustrophobic.

439
00:21:08,393 --> 00:21:12,522
Teeny-weeny tight spaces
make him very, very nervous.

440
00:21:14,441 --> 00:21:16,068
- Uh-oh.

441
00:21:16,068 --> 00:21:16,860
Uh-oh!

442
00:21:18,195 --> 00:21:20,489
- Get him away from the lid.

443
00:21:22,991 --> 00:21:26,870
- Help, we're trapped,
we're trapped like rats.

444
00:21:27,871 --> 00:21:29,623
We're trapped, we're
trapped, we're trapped.

445
00:21:29,623 --> 00:21:30,457
Trapped like rats...

446
00:21:30,457 --> 00:21:31,959
- Come back here, you crazy bird.

447
00:21:31,959 --> 00:21:36,129
Now settle down, you're rockin' the boat.

448
00:21:36,129 --> 00:21:37,839
- I can't breathe...

449
00:21:39,633 --> 00:21:42,844
- Don't make me lose my temper, Snipes.

450
00:21:44,638 --> 00:21:47,432
- I need air, I don't wanna swim.

451
00:21:48,475 --> 00:21:49,518
Mommy, we're trapped Mommy!

452
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:52,396
- Settle down.

453
00:21:53,438 --> 00:21:54,815
- Patou!
- Oh, no.

454
00:22:04,574 --> 00:22:05,367
- Aah!

455
00:22:14,793 --> 00:22:17,004
(coughing)

456
00:22:18,338 --> 00:22:19,923
That was close.

457
00:22:22,968 --> 00:22:24,052
Mercy.

458
00:22:24,052 --> 00:22:24,845
- Oh no!

459
00:22:27,973 --> 00:22:30,100
- [Peepers] Abandon ship, abandon ship!

460
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:32,394
(screaming)

461
00:22:35,856 --> 00:22:39,401
(coughing and spluttering)

462
00:22:41,903 --> 00:22:43,071
- What's that smell?

463
00:22:43,071 --> 00:22:43,905
- Garbage.

464
00:22:43,905 --> 00:22:44,990
Ah, this is pathetic.

465
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:46,199
I risk my life and what do I get?

466
00:22:46,199 --> 00:22:47,034
Garbage!

467
00:22:47,034 --> 00:22:48,327
Why, I've never been so--

468
00:22:48,327 --> 00:22:49,119
Wow!

469
00:22:53,248 --> 00:22:54,124
- The city!

470
00:22:55,208 --> 00:22:56,001
- Wow!

471
00:22:59,463 --> 00:23:01,089
- It's so beautiful.

472
00:23:02,841 --> 00:23:07,220
- Now, all we got to
do is find Chanticleer

473
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:11,350
and that's gonna be like hunting
for a needle in a haystack.

474
00:23:26,531 --> 00:23:28,658
(yawning)

475
00:23:35,248 --> 00:23:37,334
(clattering)

476
00:23:37,334 --> 00:23:38,126
- Ow!

477
00:23:40,003 --> 00:23:41,588
- Uncle Dukey, Uncle Dukey!

478
00:23:41,588 --> 00:23:42,381
I got 'em.

479
00:23:43,673 --> 00:23:48,387
- If I killed my nephew, would
that be murder or charity?

480
00:23:48,387 --> 00:23:50,180
- I got 'em, I really got 'em!

481
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:51,681
No more kitty, sir.

482
00:23:51,681 --> 00:23:53,809
Mission, oohoh, accomplished.

483
00:23:53,809 --> 00:23:54,643
- And the dog?

484
00:23:54,643 --> 00:23:56,520
- Gone, wiped out, sir.

485
00:23:57,396 --> 00:24:01,483
Total and complete, ohoh, annihilation.

486
00:24:01,483 --> 00:24:02,651
- Annihilation.

487
00:24:04,611 --> 00:24:06,071
How did you do it?

488
00:24:06,988 --> 00:24:08,407
- Adequately.

489
00:24:08,407 --> 00:24:09,241
- Ahe--

490
00:24:09,241 --> 00:24:10,784
Wait, what's that supposed to mean?

491
00:24:10,784 --> 00:24:14,371
- Well, Uncle, we sucked
them into an adequate pipe.

492
00:24:14,371 --> 00:24:15,372
- A what?

493
00:24:15,372 --> 00:24:16,623
- That's what it said.

494
00:24:16,623 --> 00:24:18,583
"Danger, adequate pipe."

495
00:24:20,293 --> 00:24:21,169
- Oh, dear.

496
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,006
Come to Uncle.

497
00:24:26,466 --> 00:24:27,843
- Aaah.

498
00:24:27,843 --> 00:24:29,386
- You imbecile!

499
00:24:29,386 --> 00:24:33,515
That's not an adequate
pipe, it's an aqueduct pipe!

500
00:24:35,434 --> 00:24:37,310
It leads straight into the city!

501
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:38,478
(gulps)

502
00:24:38,478 --> 00:24:41,940
The Duke gives you one last chance, Hunch.

503
00:24:43,358 --> 00:24:44,317
Them or you.

504
00:24:47,904 --> 00:24:49,197
Get to the city!

505
00:24:49,197 --> 00:24:50,198
- Oh, not the city, sir.

506
00:24:50,198 --> 00:24:51,032
Oh no.

507
00:24:51,032 --> 00:24:52,742
It's too bright, I'll go blind.

508
00:24:52,742 --> 00:24:54,536
- Oh, say it isn't so.

509
00:25:15,348 --> 00:25:18,602
- Chamer, Chanta, Chantilly, Chantz.

510
00:25:18,602 --> 00:25:19,978
He's not in here.

511
00:25:23,857 --> 00:25:24,649
Let's go.

512
00:25:29,988 --> 00:25:31,490
- [Patou] You ever get
that feeling when you're

513
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:35,035
;ookin' for something that
it's right under your sniffer?

514
00:25:35,035 --> 00:25:38,330
I know it seems crazy,
but it was almost like

515
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:41,458
we could hear his voice calling to us.

516
00:25:43,627 --> 00:25:45,045
You know, like he was just waiting

517
00:25:45,045 --> 00:25:47,756
for us to come and ask him back.

518
00:25:47,756 --> 00:25:52,177
But we looked everywhere,
and we talked with everyone,

519
00:25:52,177 --> 00:25:55,805
but nobody had heard
of Chanticleer, nobody.

520
00:25:57,641 --> 00:26:02,521
Funny thing was, he was right
under our nose the whole time.

521
00:26:02,521 --> 00:26:05,398
Or should I say, we were under his.

522
00:26:14,241 --> 00:26:16,993
- No, Patou, that's not how it goes.

523
00:26:16,993 --> 00:26:20,455
For the hundredth time, it's over, around,

524
00:26:22,874 --> 00:26:27,003
under and through, that's
how Patou ties his shoe.

525
00:26:28,421 --> 00:26:29,589
Now you say it.

526
00:26:30,757 --> 00:26:32,884
(humming)

527
00:26:38,431 --> 00:26:40,141
- Ooh, there you are!

528
00:26:41,476 --> 00:26:44,229
Pilot to bombardier, enemy target below!

529
00:26:44,229 --> 00:26:46,690
I'm going in for a closer look, cover me!

530
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:49,734
(makes vroom noises)

531
00:26:51,695 --> 00:26:52,529
(gasps)

532
00:26:52,529 --> 00:26:53,822
- What was that?

533
00:26:58,451 --> 00:27:00,579
(giggles)

534
00:27:01,496 --> 00:27:03,540
- Complete attrocitation.

535
00:27:07,377 --> 00:27:10,171
- Alright you guys, we've
left it long enough.

536
00:27:10,171 --> 00:27:12,757
They're counting on us back at the farm.

537
00:27:12,757 --> 00:27:14,092
- Well, if you ask me--

538
00:27:14,092 --> 00:27:15,510
- We didn't.

539
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:17,554
- Jumpin' Jehosaphat!

540
00:27:17,554 --> 00:27:18,388
- What?

541
00:27:18,388 --> 00:27:19,764
- It's him!

542
00:27:19,764 --> 00:27:20,599
- [Snipes] Who?

543
00:27:20,599 --> 00:27:22,434
- [Peepers] No wonder
we couldn't find him,

544
00:27:22,434 --> 00:27:24,311
he's changed his name.

545
00:27:24,311 --> 00:27:26,396
- [Patou] Chanticleer is the King?

546
00:27:26,396 --> 00:27:27,355
- [Edmond] The King?

547
00:27:27,355 --> 00:27:29,899
- [Patou] Ooh, your Highness.

548
00:27:29,899 --> 00:27:33,653
- [Announcer] Ladies
and gentlemen, the King!

549
00:27:33,653 --> 00:27:35,739
- [Patou] Old Chanticleer
may have stopped crowin'

550
00:27:35,739 --> 00:27:38,533
but he hadn't stopped
using that voice of his.

551
00:27:38,533 --> 00:27:40,869
♫ Let me be your rooster

552
00:27:40,869 --> 00:27:42,704
♫ And let me roost with you

553
00:27:42,704 --> 00:27:44,164
(screaming)

554
00:27:44,164 --> 00:27:45,999
♫ Let me be your rooster

555
00:27:45,999 --> 00:27:49,586
♫ Let me hear your sweet voice coo

556
00:27:49,586 --> 00:27:53,006
♫ Girl, you've thrown me for a loop

557
00:27:53,006 --> 00:27:55,967
♫ You're the number one
chick in this chicken coop

558
00:27:55,967 --> 00:27:59,387
- [Patou] Chanticleer had become a star.

559
00:27:59,387 --> 00:28:01,514
♫ I wanna rock, rock, rock
'til the day is through

560
00:28:01,514 --> 00:28:04,351
♫ I want to rock,
rock-a-doodle-doo tonight

561
00:28:04,351 --> 00:28:07,228
♫ I wanna rock, rock, rock
'til the morning light

562
00:28:07,228 --> 00:28:09,981
♫ Well it ain't right to rock alone

563
00:28:09,981 --> 00:28:12,942
♫ It takes two, I do believe

564
00:28:12,942 --> 00:28:15,236
♫ I'm gonna rock-a-doodle-doodle to you

565
00:28:15,236 --> 00:28:16,071
♫ To you

566
00:28:16,071 --> 00:28:18,865
♫ Like you rock-a-doodle-doodle to me

567
00:28:18,865 --> 00:28:20,825
♫ I'm gonna rock-a-doodle-doodle to you

568
00:28:20,825 --> 00:28:21,660
♫ To you

569
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:23,703
♫ Like you rock-a-doodle-doodle to me

570
00:28:23,703 --> 00:28:24,746
♫ Rock-a-doodle-doodle

571
00:28:24,746 --> 00:28:26,998
- [Patou] But not
everybody liked the King.

572
00:28:26,998 --> 00:28:28,833
Goldie here was jealous of him.

573
00:28:28,833 --> 00:28:31,419
- Less my manager's fee of 60%.

574
00:28:31,419 --> 00:28:35,256
- Look, Pinky, I just have to know when.

575
00:28:35,256 --> 00:28:39,135
- Oooh, Goldie, will you not
bother me with this right now?

576
00:28:39,135 --> 00:28:41,262
You've gotta go on in two minutes.

577
00:28:41,262 --> 00:28:44,057
- But I'm too good for the chorus.

578
00:28:45,308 --> 00:28:47,936
What's he got that I ain't got?

579
00:28:47,936 --> 00:28:49,062
- A voice.

580
00:28:49,062 --> 00:28:51,606
♫ I wanna rock, rock-a-doodle
through the night

581
00:28:51,606 --> 00:28:55,193
♫ I wanna rock, rock, rock
'til the morning light

582
00:28:55,193 --> 00:28:57,237
- [Patou] Fortunately
for us, Goldie was a lot

583
00:28:57,237 --> 00:29:00,907
smarter than she sounded,
and a lot nicer too.

584
00:29:00,907 --> 00:29:03,201
She just didn't know it yet.

585
00:29:03,201 --> 00:29:05,036
♫ Like you rock-a-doodle-doodle to me

586
00:29:05,036 --> 00:29:08,081
♫ Rock-a-doodle, rock-a-doodle,
rock-a-doodle-doo to me

587
00:29:08,081 --> 00:29:11,418
- Lookie, Goldie, when I
found him, he was a nobody.

588
00:29:11,418 --> 00:29:14,045
Nobody wanted him, nobody cared about him,

589
00:29:14,045 --> 00:29:16,464
but I picked him up out of the gutter

590
00:29:16,464 --> 00:29:18,466
and now look at him.

591
00:29:18,466 --> 00:29:22,303
♫ Well it ain't right to rock alone

592
00:29:22,303 --> 00:29:24,848
Everybody starts in the chorus. Goldie.

593
00:29:24,848 --> 00:29:28,351
Of course, you could
give up show business.

594
00:29:29,394 --> 00:29:30,478
- Pinky!

595
00:29:30,478 --> 00:29:33,064
♫ I wanna rock-a-doodle-doodle to you

596
00:29:33,064 --> 00:29:37,444
♫ Just like you rock-a-doodle-doodle to me

597
00:29:37,444 --> 00:29:39,487
- Thank you, thank you very much.

598
00:29:39,487 --> 00:29:41,030
I love you, I love you.

599
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:42,866
(audience cheering)

600
00:29:42,866 --> 00:29:44,284
- [Edmond] Now that we found him,

601
00:29:44,284 --> 00:29:46,536
how do we get in to see him?

602
00:29:46,536 --> 00:29:47,704
- [Announcer] Ladies and gentlemen,

603
00:29:47,704 --> 00:29:50,623
the King is leaving the building.

604
00:29:50,623 --> 00:29:51,416
- Ow!

605
00:29:52,625 --> 00:29:53,918
- Out of the way!

606
00:29:53,918 --> 00:29:56,171
Move it, move it, move it!

607
00:29:56,171 --> 00:29:57,797
Don't touch the frogs.

608
00:29:57,797 --> 00:29:59,299
♫ Try it, you won't get very far

609
00:29:59,299 --> 00:30:01,217
♫ We'll bounce you once, bounce you twice

610
00:30:01,217 --> 00:30:03,136
♫ If you get out of
line, we're not very nice

611
00:30:03,136 --> 00:30:05,180
♫ We'll bounce, bounce
you all over the place

612
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:09,434
♫ Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce,
if we don't like your face

613
00:30:09,434 --> 00:30:11,603
Get away from the star!

614
00:30:11,603 --> 00:30:13,980
- [Patou] Chanticleer was a star alright,

615
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:15,857
but it's hard to be happy without friends

616
00:30:15,857 --> 00:30:18,151
even if you are famous.

617
00:30:18,151 --> 00:30:20,945
I reckon he'd be awfully glad to see us,

618
00:30:20,945 --> 00:30:24,741
if we could just figure
a way to get near him.

619
00:30:26,034 --> 00:30:27,160
- Aggravation.

620
00:30:31,956 --> 00:30:34,083
- You were fantastic tonight, really!

621
00:30:34,083 --> 00:30:35,752
What can I get for ya, kid?

622
00:30:35,752 --> 00:30:37,295
You name it, anything

623
00:30:37,295 --> 00:30:38,838
You want a beach house in Maui?

624
00:30:38,838 --> 00:30:41,007
Ooh, I'll buy you the whole island.

625
00:30:41,007 --> 00:30:42,884
Cars, yachts, what?

626
00:30:42,884 --> 00:30:44,511
Name it, it's yours.

627
00:30:46,763 --> 00:30:47,597
- Ah, thanks.

628
00:30:47,597 --> 00:30:49,974
- Say, what's eatin' you?

629
00:30:49,974 --> 00:30:51,392
- Well, I...

630
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:53,102
Well, I just don't know.

631
00:30:53,102 --> 00:30:55,021
I guess I'm just a little
lonely, that's all.

632
00:30:55,021 --> 00:30:55,772
- Lonely?

633
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:58,817
Are you crazy?

634
00:30:58,817 --> 00:31:01,861
There's 20,000 people out
there screaming your name

635
00:31:01,861 --> 00:31:03,321
and you're lonely?

636
00:31:04,364 --> 00:31:05,615
(glass breaking)

637
00:31:05,615 --> 00:31:07,200
I love this guy.

638
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,994
- Yeah, but back on the farm...

639
00:31:09,994 --> 00:31:13,748
- Hey, you told me yourself
what they did to ya on the farm.

640
00:31:13,748 --> 00:31:15,834
They don't love you.

641
00:31:15,834 --> 00:31:17,710
Murray, give us a roll.

642
00:31:19,087 --> 00:31:19,879
See that?

643
00:31:21,756 --> 00:31:23,216
They love you, eh?

644
00:31:29,347 --> 00:31:30,557
You were incredible.

645
00:31:30,557 --> 00:31:32,767
Mm-mm-mm, the King!

646
00:31:32,767 --> 00:31:34,894
Murray, get us outta here.

647
00:31:36,479 --> 00:31:37,856
Hello, Goldie?

648
00:31:37,856 --> 00:31:41,150
How'd you like to get out of the chorus?

649
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:45,488
- [Patou] Meanwhile, back on the farm...

650
00:31:45,488 --> 00:31:47,907
(whimpering)

651
00:31:50,243 --> 00:31:51,411
- She's fading fast.

652
00:31:51,411 --> 00:31:52,996
How many more batteries have we got?

653
00:31:52,996 --> 00:31:54,330
- Just these two.

654
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:55,456
- Oh, sadness.

655
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:57,250
(phone ringing)

656
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:59,377
(squeals)

657
00:32:01,212 --> 00:32:02,839
- Whoa, sorry ma'am.

658
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:04,966
Who is it, who is it?

659
00:32:04,966 --> 00:32:05,800
What do you want?

660
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:06,634
We've got an emergency here.

661
00:32:06,634 --> 00:32:08,344
Yeah, yeah, Edmond?

662
00:32:08,344 --> 00:32:09,888
Anybody here named Edmond?

663
00:32:09,888 --> 00:32:11,347
- I'm Edmond!

664
00:32:11,347 --> 00:32:12,432
The little boy who--

665
00:32:12,432 --> 00:32:13,766
I mean, the kitty.

666
00:32:13,766 --> 00:32:14,809
Who's this?

667
00:32:14,809 --> 00:32:17,061
- Stuey, Stuey the pig.

668
00:32:17,061 --> 00:32:17,979
It's the kitty!

669
00:32:17,979 --> 00:32:20,607
- Stuey, the light's going out.

670
00:32:20,607 --> 00:32:22,233
- The lights are going out,
the lights are going out!

671
00:32:22,233 --> 00:32:24,110
Kitty, look, we're
running out of time here.

672
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:25,653
We need Chanticleer, quick!

673
00:32:25,653 --> 00:32:27,739
- We'll be there as soon as we can!

674
00:32:27,739 --> 00:32:29,073
- Stuey!

675
00:32:29,073 --> 00:32:30,450
- Yeah, yeah, I hear ya, I hear ya.

676
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:31,784
Sorry kitty, gotta go, gotta go.

677
00:32:31,784 --> 00:32:33,286
(squeals) Good-bye.

678
00:32:33,286 --> 00:32:35,997
- Stuey, what about my family?

679
00:32:35,997 --> 00:32:37,582
Are they alright?

680
00:32:37,582 --> 00:32:38,625
Soeey, Soeey?

681
00:32:40,501 --> 00:32:41,336
Stuey!

682
00:32:41,336 --> 00:32:43,630
(chuckling)

683
00:32:47,091 --> 00:32:48,301
- Hello, kitty?

684
00:32:50,345 --> 00:32:52,055
It's the Duke.

685
00:32:52,055 --> 00:32:55,350
I have some rather bad news, I'm afraid.

686
00:32:57,685 --> 00:33:01,648
When the batteries expire,
so will your friends.

687
00:33:03,608 --> 00:33:05,902
Toodle-oo, cheerio, bye.

688

690
00:33:09,322 --> 00:33:10,114

Oh howdy, boss, how are you?

Uh-huh, huh?

701

Did you say a cat, a
dog, a bird and a mouse?

702
00:33:57,495 --> 00:33:58,788
What is this?

703
00:33:58,788 --> 00:34:00,707
(laughs)

704
00:34:00,707 --> 00:34:02,333
Some kinda joke, huh?

705
00:34:02,333 --> 00:34:04,919
- Well I don't think it's funny, Pinky.

706
00:34:04,919 --> 00:34:09,424
they want to bring
Chanticleer back to the farm.

707
00:34:09,424 --> 00:34:12,260
You don't want that, he
makes you lots of money.

708
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:14,887
I don't want that, he makes me miserable.

709
00:34:14,887 --> 00:34:18,641
- [Pinky] Right boss,
what should I do about it?

710
00:34:18,641 --> 00:34:22,770
- Your chicken thinks they
don't want him on the farm.

711
00:34:23,855 --> 00:34:25,231
That's good.

712
00:34:25,231 --> 00:34:29,360
All you have to do is make
sure he keeps thinking that.

713
00:34:30,653 --> 00:34:33,740
It's not good that the
kitty and his friends

714
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:36,701
should talk to your chicken, capice?

715
00:34:38,453 --> 00:34:40,455
- Yeah, thanks a million.

716
00:34:40,455 --> 00:34:43,082
This has been most enlightening.

717
00:34:58,723 --> 00:35:00,183
- Penguin suits, two for a dollar.

718
00:35:00,183 --> 00:35:02,602
You wanna see the King, come
and get your penguin suits.

719
00:35:02,602 --> 00:35:05,980
Remember, no dogs, cats, birds or meeses.

720
00:35:12,236 --> 00:35:14,947
- "Dear Chanticleer, we're sorry.

721
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,367
"Come home, your friends."

722
00:35:20,328 --> 00:35:22,789
Here guys, come on, sign this.

723
00:35:24,165 --> 00:35:24,999
Here.

724
00:35:24,999 --> 00:35:26,375
- Must you bother me whilst I dine?

725
00:35:26,375 --> 00:35:27,710
- Snipes, sign this.

726
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:29,170
- Oh heavens.

727
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:30,797
Where have you been all my life?

728
00:35:30,797 --> 00:35:32,924
Lasagna a la pasta.

729
00:35:32,924 --> 00:35:33,758
- Just sign it.

730
00:35:33,758 --> 00:35:34,634
- Ah, sure.

731
00:35:36,803 --> 00:35:39,180
- Excuse me, sir, would you please

732
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:40,932
see that the King gets this?

733
00:35:40,932 --> 00:35:42,892
- Yeah, it's really important.

734
00:35:42,892 --> 00:35:44,018
- Oh, and waiter?

735
00:35:44,018 --> 00:35:48,231
We asked for light cola,
this stuff weighs a ton!

736
00:35:48,231 --> 00:35:49,774
- Hmm.

737
00:35:49,774 --> 00:35:51,067
Get me the boss.

738
00:35:52,235 --> 00:35:54,112
- It sounds bad, Pinky.

739
00:35:55,071 --> 00:35:58,991
- It's only a little bad, not a big bad.

740
00:35:58,991 --> 00:36:02,495
Look, he's lonely, he needs a friend.

741
00:36:02,495 --> 00:36:05,873
And that bad little kitty
wants to steal him away.

742
00:36:05,873 --> 00:36:08,084
You don't want that, do ya?

743
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:10,419
- [Announcer] Ladies and gentlemen,

744
00:36:10,419 --> 00:36:13,798
Pinky's Palace proudly presents the King!

745
00:36:18,719 --> 00:36:21,722
- Thank you, thank you very much.

746
00:36:21,722 --> 00:36:24,684
(cheering)

747
00:36:24,684 --> 00:36:27,228
- [Patou] Would you look at that.

748
00:36:27,228 --> 00:36:28,396
- Chanticleer?

749
00:36:28,396 --> 00:36:30,273
♫ Well down in Tupelo

750
00:36:30,273 --> 00:36:32,108
♫ I was so alone

751
00:36:32,108 --> 00:36:35,278
♫ I never had no money to
have no honey for my own

752
00:36:35,278 --> 00:36:37,613
♫ That's why I'm treasure hunting

753
00:36:37,613 --> 00:36:38,447
♫ Whaa-Oo

754
00:36:38,447 --> 00:36:40,241
♫ Treasure hunting for my love

755
00:36:40,241 --> 00:36:43,244
♫ He's treasure hunting for his love

756
00:36:43,244 --> 00:36:47,039

00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:50,334
♫ But I ain't found no rainbow
yet that had a pot of gold

758
00:36:50,334 --> 00:36:52,503
♫ Well, I'm treasure hunting

759
00:36:52,503 --> 00:36:54,547
- You know, I think he died of fear.

760
00:36:54,547 --> 00:36:56,424
- Hey, what are you doing little fella?

761
00:36:56,424 --> 00:36:58,092
- Something I learned in school.

762
00:36:58,092 --> 00:36:59,260
- Cats don't go to school.

763
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:00,970
- But boys do.

764
00:37:00,970 --> 00:37:01,804
- Hey!

765
00:37:01,804 --> 00:37:04,182
You boys is dead meat.

766
00:37:04,182 --> 00:37:05,892

00:37:13,274 --> 00:37:17,403
♫ He introduced me to
every single purty mermaid

770

00:37:19,822 --> 00:37:21,282
♫ So I keep treasure hunting

772
00:37:21,282 --> 00:37:22,617

773
00:37:22,617 --> 00:37:24,869
- No one gets hurt.

774
00:37:24,869 --> 00:37:27,622
You just do the number, make him happy

775
00:37:27,622 --> 00:37:30,458

00:37:39,508 --> 00:37:41,135
Get them outta here!

780
00:37:42,136 --> 00:37:44,805
Wait a minute, don't spoil the show, huh?

781
00:37:44,805 --> 00:37:46,641

(applause)

795
00:38:14,627 --> 00:38:15,419
- Now.

796
00:38:28,015 --> 00:38:32,853
♫ Deep deep, the trouble you're in

797
00:38:32,853 --> 00:38:36,983
♫ I've thrown you to the
sharks and you can't swim

798
00:38:40,278 --> 00:38:41,070
- Oh no.

799
00:38:54,375 --> 00:38:57,253
Well, you can take the
rooster out of the country

800
00:38:57,253 --> 00:39:00,506
but you can't take the
country out of the rooster.

801
00:39:00,506 --> 00:39:02,842
Old Chanticleer had found
himself a city perch

802
00:39:02,842 --> 00:39:07,096
sorta tailored to remind him
of the farm he'd left behind.

803
00:39:07,096 --> 00:39:09,890
Trouble was, with Goldie on the scene

804
00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:13,686
he wasn't feelin' so
lonesome for us anymore,

805
00:39:13,686 --> 00:39:16,981
which was exactly the way Pinky wanted it.

806
00:39:16,981 --> 00:39:21,110
'Cause that was exactly the
way the Grand Duke wanted it.

807
00:39:23,321 --> 00:39:26,949
There was just one problem
with their plan, of course.

808
00:39:26,949 --> 00:39:29,785
Goldie was only supposed to pretend

809
00:39:29,785 --> 00:39:32,788
to fall in love with Chanticleer,

810
00:39:32,788 --> 00:39:35,750
but she was falling in love for real

811
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:40,838
and that can really change a pheasant.

812
00:39:42,882 --> 00:39:46,927
♫ Love has said hello, you don't know

813
00:39:49,388 --> 00:39:53,517
♫ What that means, really means to me

814
00:39:55,102 --> 00:39:57,730
- Ooooh, I think we've lost him.

815
00:39:58,606 --> 00:39:59,815
- What do you mean?

816
00:39:59,815 --> 00:40:01,150
He's right there.

817
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:03,235
- Oh, no, no he ain't.

818
00:40:03,235 --> 00:40:05,321
He's a thousand miles away.

819
00:40:05,321 --> 00:40:06,155
- Huh?

820
00:40:06,155 --> 00:40:08,449
(sighs)

821
00:40:08,449 --> 00:40:10,076
- Isn't it romantic?

822
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:15,206
When roosters fall in
love, they lose all reason.

823
00:40:16,248 --> 00:40:18,751
- Aaah, enough mush, let's go eat.

824
00:40:18,751 --> 00:40:19,668
- Eat?

825
00:40:19,668 --> 00:40:22,171
How can you think of
food at a time like this?

826
00:40:22,171 --> 00:40:23,339
- Lasagna!

827
00:40:23,339 --> 00:40:24,298
Mm-mm-mm-mm.

828
00:40:25,424 --> 00:40:27,635
- Chanticleer, Chanticleer!

829
00:40:30,054 --> 00:40:33,182
- Oh Goldie, when I left the farm,

830
00:40:33,182 --> 00:40:35,518
I had such a big hole in my heart.

831
00:40:35,518 --> 00:40:38,020
You coulda put a John Deere
tractor through there.

832
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:40,147
- Oh, you poor thing.

833
00:40:40,147 --> 00:40:41,857
- My heart is so full I could,

834
00:40:41,857 --> 00:40:44,860
I could just explode like a bloated lamb.

835
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:47,905
- Oh King, you say the nicest things.

836
00:40:49,115 --> 00:40:50,866
- [Edmond] Chanticleer!

837
00:40:50,866 --> 00:40:54,495
♫ This song is our treasure

838
00:40:55,496 --> 00:40:59,625
♫ that we'll share our whole life through

839
00:41:00,543 --> 00:41:02,002
- Chanticleer!

840
00:41:02,002 --> 00:41:05,423
- I'm Sorry, Little Buddy,
but We're just no match

841
00:41:05,423 --> 00:41:07,550
for that painted feather duster.

842
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:08,676
- Oh yeah?

843
00:41:08,676 --> 00:41:10,803
- Uh, hey, where you goin'?

844
00:41:10,803 --> 00:41:13,973
- Well if I can't talk
to him, I'll talk to her.

845
00:41:13,973 --> 00:41:17,601
♫ As I kiss and coo

846
00:41:17,601 --> 00:41:21,397
♫ Kiss, kiss and coo with you

847
00:41:34,118 --> 00:41:38,664
- [Newsboy] Read all about it,
mysterious rains spreading!

848
00:41:38,664 --> 00:41:40,958
Sun don't shine for farmers!

849
00:41:49,925 --> 00:41:54,054
- "Goldie Pheasant to co-star
in King's new picture."

850
00:41:56,390 --> 00:42:00,144
You know, I think I'm too
little to get over those gates.

851
00:42:00,144 --> 00:42:01,437
- Well, I'm not.

852
00:42:03,898 --> 00:42:07,860
- [Patou] Hey, I think that's
her trailer over there.

853
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:09,945
(humming)

854
00:42:17,828 --> 00:42:18,996
(clears throat)

855
00:42:18,996 --> 00:42:19,830
- Excuse me, ma'am?

856
00:42:19,830 --> 00:42:21,081
(gasps)

857
00:42:21,081 --> 00:42:22,541
- Oh, who are you?

858
00:42:24,001 --> 00:42:25,961
- Ma'am, I, I--

859
00:42:25,961 --> 00:42:26,795
(sneezes)

860
00:42:26,795 --> 00:42:28,339
- Oh my goodness.

861
00:42:28,339 --> 00:42:31,217
(sneezing continues)

862
00:42:31,217 --> 00:42:33,135
Oh, you poor thing!

863
00:42:33,135 --> 00:42:37,264
There, now what are you
doing in my dressing room?

864
00:42:40,142 --> 00:42:42,686
- Please ma'am, you're the
only one who can help us.

865
00:42:42,686 --> 00:42:44,688
We have to talk to Chanticleer.

866
00:42:44,688 --> 00:42:45,981
I mean, the King.

867
00:42:45,981 --> 00:42:47,358
There's a terrible flood, and

868
00:42:47,358 --> 00:42:48,859
if he doesn't come home and crow...

869
00:42:48,859 --> 00:42:51,529
- Wait a minute, wait a minute!

870
00:42:51,529 --> 00:42:55,783
You're the bad little
kitty Pinky told me about.

871
00:42:55,783 --> 00:42:56,742
- Bad, me?

872
00:42:56,742 --> 00:42:57,701
I'm not bad.

873
00:42:59,370 --> 00:43:01,747
- You go away or I'll scream!

874
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,041
(screams)

875
00:43:04,041 --> 00:43:06,669
- Please, if you'd just listen--

876
00:43:08,087 --> 00:43:10,381
(screaming)

877
00:43:16,512 --> 00:43:17,763
What happened?

878
00:43:17,763 --> 00:43:19,515
- Ah, she's a woman.

879
00:43:19,515 --> 00:43:20,307
- W-what?

880
00:43:23,352 --> 00:43:26,355
That's the last straw, I've had it!

881
00:43:26,355 --> 00:43:28,399
- I wasn't talking to you--

882
00:43:28,399 --> 00:43:30,025
Aah!

883
00:43:30,025 --> 00:43:33,112
(Pinky laughing)

884
00:43:33,112 --> 00:43:34,738
- Well, well, well.

885
00:43:34,738 --> 00:43:38,117
The dog, the cat, the bird and the mouse.

886
00:43:39,034 --> 00:43:41,328
We meet at last, eh?

887
00:43:41,328 --> 00:43:42,663
(laughing)

888
00:43:42,663 --> 00:43:43,622
- Let us go!

889
00:43:44,957 --> 00:43:47,751
- Max, take 'em to my
trailer, lock 'em up.

890
00:43:47,751 --> 00:43:51,630
Make sure the King doesn't
get a whiff of this.

891
00:43:52,798 --> 00:43:54,925
- Oh no, what have I done?

892
00:43:56,010 --> 00:43:58,220
(laughing)

893
00:44:01,932 --> 00:44:04,643
- No dogs, cats, boids or meeses.

894
00:44:05,561 --> 00:44:06,353
- Ahah!

895
00:44:08,897 --> 00:44:11,650
- [Patou] Now I gotta admit,
as bad guys go, the Duke's

896
00:44:11,650 --> 00:44:15,779
nephew Hunch was more a
hoot than he was horrible.

897
00:44:18,282 --> 00:44:20,451
- (gurgling) Oh, boy.

898
00:44:20,451 --> 00:44:22,286
- [Patou] But still, he was a nuisance

899
00:44:22,286 --> 00:44:24,204
and as we were tied up at the moment,

900
00:44:24,204 --> 00:44:27,249
we weren't all that happy to see him.

901
00:44:28,417 --> 00:44:29,209
- Ahah!

902
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:40,179
♫ I will always think of you

903
00:44:40,179 --> 00:44:43,766
♫ Ma, I miss your apple pie

904
00:44:43,766 --> 00:44:46,810
♫ Ma, I miss your stew

905
00:44:46,810 --> 00:44:50,856
♫ But most of all Ma, I miss you

906
00:44:53,651 --> 00:44:56,278
Look at that, ooh, anticipation!

907
00:44:57,863 --> 00:44:58,656
Ow!

908
00:45:03,494 --> 00:45:04,286
Ah, oh!

909
00:45:12,252 --> 00:45:14,463
(crashing)

910
00:45:20,969 --> 00:45:23,764
♫ Let's get away, you and me together

911
00:45:23,764 --> 00:45:25,474
♫ Two birds of a feather flying--

912
00:45:25,474 --> 00:45:27,434
- [Pinky] Cut, cut, cut!

913
00:45:28,352 --> 00:45:31,313
Murray, what's with the snow here?

914
00:45:31,313 --> 00:45:32,690
Take five, everybody.

915
00:45:32,690 --> 00:45:35,984
And Miss Pheasant, how 'bout a smile, hmm?

916
00:45:35,984 --> 00:45:37,986
Oh, it's supposed to be
summer, for cryin' out loud!

917
00:45:37,986 --> 00:45:39,697
- King, may I talk to you?

918
00:45:39,697 --> 00:45:42,116
- Ah honey, don't pay no mind.

919
00:45:42,116 --> 00:45:43,534
You're gonna do just fine.

920
00:45:43,534 --> 00:45:44,368
- Yeah, but--

921
00:45:44,368 --> 00:45:45,911
- Now, now, no buts about it, honey.

922
00:45:45,911 --> 00:45:48,706
- King, I've done something awful.

923
00:45:49,832 --> 00:45:51,375
- What is it, baby?

924
00:45:53,419 --> 00:45:55,295
Patou, Snipes, Peepers.

925
00:45:56,547 --> 00:45:57,840
Goldie, where'd you get this?

926
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:00,759
- From you, that night we first met.

927
00:46:00,759 --> 00:46:02,553
- They were here?

928
00:46:02,553 --> 00:46:04,263
- They're still here.

929
00:46:07,224 --> 00:46:09,268
- Why didn't you tell me?

930
00:46:10,728 --> 00:46:12,688
- 'Cause she wasn't supposed to!

931
00:46:12,688 --> 00:46:14,398
(gasps)

932
00:46:14,398 --> 00:46:16,942
Goldie, I'm disappointed in ya.

933
00:46:18,110 --> 00:46:22,322
I said to entertain
him, not to educate him.

934
00:46:22,322 --> 00:46:24,074
- Entertain me?

935
00:46:24,074 --> 00:46:25,242
What's this all about?

936
00:46:25,242 --> 00:46:27,661
- Calm down, kid, your
friends are just fine.

937
00:46:27,661 --> 00:46:28,787
- No they're not, King.

938
00:46:28,787 --> 00:46:30,622
He's got them tied up in his--

939
00:46:30,622 --> 00:46:31,915
- Shut up!

940
00:46:31,915 --> 00:46:32,708
- What?

941
00:46:36,754 --> 00:46:38,338
Where are they?

942
00:46:38,338 --> 00:46:40,382
What have you done with 'em?

943
00:46:40,382 --> 00:46:43,093
- Don't hurt him boys,
he's got a movie to make.

944
00:46:43,093 --> 00:46:44,636
- I ain't making nothin' with you.

945
00:46:44,636 --> 00:46:48,682
- Oh but King, I got a lotta
money tied up in this picture.

946
00:46:48,682 --> 00:46:50,684
I don't wanna lose my money,

947
00:46:50,684 --> 00:46:53,061
and you don't wanna lose your friends.

948
00:46:53,061 --> 00:46:54,104
- That's blackmail!

949
00:46:54,104 --> 00:46:55,939
- That's showbiz!

950
00:46:55,939 --> 00:46:56,732
Make-up!

951
00:46:57,858 --> 00:46:59,568
- Here, kitty, kitty.

952
00:47:01,737 --> 00:47:03,447
Ohhoho, acceleration!

953
00:47:06,909 --> 00:47:07,701
Ow!

954
00:47:10,954 --> 00:47:13,332
(TV playing)

955
00:47:32,768 --> 00:47:33,560
Aah!

956
00:47:38,732 --> 00:47:39,566
- Stand by

957
00:47:39,566 --> 00:47:40,400
- Stand by!

958
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:41,276
- Quiet on the set.

959
00:47:41,276 --> 00:47:42,110
- Quiet on the set!

960
00:47:42,110 --> 00:47:43,612
- Hey, shut up.

961
00:47:43,612 --> 00:47:44,947
- King, I'm sorry.

962
00:47:44,947 --> 00:47:46,281
- Don't talk to me, I'm thinkin'.

963
00:47:46,281 --> 00:47:47,658
- Roll sound.

964
00:47:47,658 --> 00:47:49,159
- Speed.

965
00:47:49,159 --> 00:47:49,993
- Where are they?

966
00:47:49,993 --> 00:47:52,079
- They're in Pinky's trailer outside.

967
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:52,871
- Mark it.

968
00:47:53,831 --> 00:47:55,290
42A, take two.

969
00:47:55,290 --> 00:47:57,251
(clack)

970
00:47:58,710 --> 00:47:59,503
- Oh yeah!

971
00:48:01,171 --> 00:48:02,965
Hang on, honey.

972
00:48:02,965 --> 00:48:05,676
(engine revving)

973
00:48:07,886 --> 00:48:09,930
That's not in the script.

974
00:48:11,181 --> 00:48:13,350
- Stop those birds!

975
00:48:13,350 --> 00:48:14,476
Get them back!

976
00:48:16,937 --> 00:48:18,522
- Look, there it is!

977
00:48:20,732 --> 00:48:23,986
- Hoohoho, annihilation, abominations.

978
00:48:23,986 --> 00:48:25,195
Hold still, ow.

979
00:48:27,614 --> 00:48:29,908
(screaming)

980
00:48:31,410 --> 00:48:32,828
Watch out, King!

981
00:48:32,828 --> 00:48:33,620
- Whoa!

982
00:48:41,211 --> 00:48:43,589
- Oh no, no, I've killed him.

983
00:48:44,464 --> 00:48:46,091
- Chanticleer!

984
00:48:46,091 --> 00:48:47,134
- Hi, fellas.

985
00:48:48,302 --> 00:48:50,512
- He's dead, he's dead,
he's dead, he's dead!

986
00:48:50,512 --> 00:48:53,557
- Hey fellas, I'm sorry about this.

987
00:48:53,557 --> 00:48:55,767
- Jumpin' Jehosaphat!

988
00:48:55,767 --> 00:48:57,895
- He's not dead, untie me!

989
00:48:59,271 --> 00:49:01,440
(engines roaring)

990
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:02,274
Oh no!

991
00:49:02,274 --> 00:49:05,277
- Let's get him out of here.

992
00:49:05,277 --> 00:49:06,403
- Who's there?

993
00:49:22,628 --> 00:49:24,838
- Oh no, not Pinky's Caddy.

994
00:49:30,010 --> 00:49:31,595
- Can you drive a car?

995
00:49:31,595 --> 00:49:32,721
- Piece of cake.

996
00:49:32,721 --> 00:49:34,473
Edmond, you steer.

997
00:49:34,473 --> 00:49:35,307
- Steer?

998
00:49:35,307 --> 00:49:37,351
I can't, I've n ever driven a car,

999
00:49:37,351 --> 00:49:38,518
- Edmond, do it.

1000
00:49:38,518 --> 00:49:39,353
- We'll crash.

1001
00:49:39,353 --> 00:49:41,730
- Don't be such a fraidy-cat!

1002
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:45,692
- Hey!

1003
00:49:54,701 --> 00:49:55,494
- Whoa!

1004
00:50:12,135 --> 00:50:14,221
- Edmond, open your eyes!

1005
00:50:14,221 --> 00:50:15,347
- Uh-oh, look!

1006
00:50:18,225 --> 00:50:19,643
- Abomination!

1007
00:50:19,643 --> 00:50:20,435
Oww!

1008
00:50:22,187 --> 00:50:24,815
- Come on, Edmond, we
gotta lose that trailer.

1009
00:50:24,815 --> 00:50:25,649
- How?

1010
00:50:25,649 --> 00:50:27,693
- Edmond, cats are climbers.

1011
00:50:27,693 --> 00:50:28,944
- I'm a boy!

1012
00:50:28,944 --> 00:50:29,987
- Just climb down there--

1013
00:50:29,987 --> 00:50:31,571
- What? I can't.

1014
00:50:31,571 --> 00:50:33,031
- Don't be such a sissy!

1015
00:50:33,031 --> 00:50:33,865
- I'll fall!

1016
00:50:33,865 --> 00:50:35,742
- You're a cat, you won't fall!

1017
00:50:35,742 --> 00:50:36,576
- I will!

1018
00:50:36,576 --> 00:50:38,203
- Oh, I'll do it myself.

1019
00:50:38,203 --> 00:50:40,330
You're such a scaredy-cat.

1020
00:50:49,131 --> 00:50:51,258
(screams)

1021
00:50:52,968 --> 00:50:53,760
Edmond!

1022
00:50:55,345 --> 00:50:56,471
- Patou, help!

1023
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:00,892
Hold on!

1024
00:51:05,105 --> 00:51:06,398
(screams)

1025
00:51:06,398 --> 00:51:07,190
Help!

1026
00:51:09,860 --> 00:51:10,652
Peepers!

1027
00:51:13,405 --> 00:51:15,407
- Don't be a fraidy-cat.

1028
00:51:15,407 --> 00:51:16,450
Fraidy-cat...

1029
00:51:16,450 --> 00:51:17,701
- I'm not afraid of anything.

1030
00:51:17,701 --> 00:51:20,746
(voices overlapping)

1031
00:51:26,084 --> 00:51:26,877
- No!

1032
00:51:27,836 --> 00:51:28,628
Stop!

1033
00:51:36,011 --> 00:51:39,389
Guys, we're gonna go back and get her!

1034
00:51:39,389 --> 00:51:42,017
(tires screech)

1035
00:51:44,186 --> 00:51:45,562
(horn honking)

1036
00:51:45,562 --> 00:51:48,190
- Oh sure, they wanna play chicken, eh?

1037
00:51:48,190 --> 00:51:49,775
- Don't worry, boss, I ain't turnin'.

1038
00:51:49,775 --> 00:51:51,610
- Idiot, that's my car!

1039
00:51:55,197 --> 00:51:55,989
- Whoa!

1040
00:51:57,449 --> 00:51:59,076
- Snipes, the brake!

1041
00:52:04,247 --> 00:52:06,500
I think she landed up here.

1042
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:07,292
Peepers!

1043
00:52:08,919 --> 00:52:11,129
Come on, we gotta find her!

1044
00:52:17,719 --> 00:52:19,304
- Ooh, my baby!

1045
00:52:19,304 --> 00:52:20,764
My beautiful baby.

1046
00:52:21,807 --> 00:52:23,350
What are you lookin' at?

1047
00:52:23,350 --> 00:52:24,601
Get up there!

1048
00:52:24,601 --> 00:52:25,352
- Peepers!

1049
00:52:29,106 --> 00:52:30,649
- Oh King, wake up.

1050
00:52:31,525 --> 00:52:32,567
Oh, my shoes!

1051
00:52:35,362 --> 00:52:38,198
(grunting)

1052
00:52:38,198 --> 00:52:38,990
- Bozo!

1053
00:52:40,158 --> 00:52:41,451
- Snipes!

1054
00:52:41,451 --> 00:52:43,995
- We're trapped, we're
trapped, we're trapped.

1055
00:52:43,995 --> 00:52:45,914
- Don't look down!

1056
00:52:45,914 --> 00:52:48,625
(metal creaking)

1057
00:52:51,086 --> 00:52:53,797
- This is it, fellas, we're goin' down.

1058
00:52:53,797 --> 00:52:55,632
- Snipes, do something!

1059
00:53:01,388 --> 00:53:02,597
- Don't let go!

1060
00:53:03,557 --> 00:53:05,851
(screaming)

1061
00:53:11,565 --> 00:53:12,858
- What a catch!

1062
00:53:14,109 --> 00:53:15,819
Bring 'em in, Murray.

1063
00:53:15,819 --> 00:53:16,611
Murray?

1064
00:53:17,863 --> 00:53:19,072
- Murray, who's Murray?

1065
00:53:19,072 --> 00:53:19,906
- Peepers!

1066
00:53:19,906 --> 00:53:20,740
- Edmond!

1067
00:53:20,740 --> 00:53:23,702
Let's have some help up
here, this is the Quirky X62

1068
00:53:23,702 --> 00:53:26,079
and these things are craaazy!

1069
00:53:27,747 --> 00:53:30,792
- The King, he's gone and I'm ruined!

1070
00:53:39,718 --> 00:53:41,261
- Oh no no no!

1071
00:53:41,261 --> 00:53:42,888
- Oh, yes, yes, yes.

1072
00:53:44,848 --> 00:53:48,768
Gentlemen, go down and
invite our friends to dinner.

1073
00:53:48,768 --> 00:53:50,061
- Hoo, hoo, hoo!

1074
00:53:51,104 --> 00:53:53,523
♫ We are the creatures of the night

1075
00:53:53,523 --> 00:53:55,692
♫ And we invite you all for dinner

1076
00:53:55,692 --> 00:53:57,903
♫ There's plenty of food to go around

1077
00:53:57,903 --> 00:54:00,739
♫ When the food is you

1078
00:54:00,739 --> 00:54:01,615
- Who, me?

1079
00:54:01,615 --> 00:54:02,616
♫ Yes, you

1080
00:54:02,616 --> 00:54:05,035
♫ We thought a picnic would be nice

1081
00:54:05,035 --> 00:54:07,704
♫ And we're so pleased
that you could join us

1082
00:54:07,704 --> 00:54:09,789
♫ We're glad you're home, trick or treat

1083
00:54:09,789 --> 00:54:10,999
♫ Fa la la la la la

1084
00:54:10,999 --> 00:54:12,042
♫ How sweet

1085
00:54:12,042 --> 00:54:15,128
♫ Now's the time, say your prayers

1086
00:54:15,128 --> 00:54:15,962
♫ Time's up

1087
00:54:15,962 --> 00:54:17,756
♫ Fa la la la la la, how sweet

1088
00:54:17,756 --> 00:54:21,009
♫ Fa la la la la, let's eat

1089
00:54:21,009 --> 00:54:22,969
- Please, pass the pork.

1090
00:54:29,517 --> 00:54:30,560
(laughing)

1091
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:33,230
Excellent, gentlemen, excellent.

1092
00:54:33,230 --> 00:54:35,523
(screaming)

1093
00:54:36,483 --> 00:54:39,236
- Alright you owls, this is Edmond.

1094
00:54:39,236 --> 00:54:42,948
It's over for you, we've got Chanticleer!

1095
00:54:42,948 --> 00:54:45,158
(cheering)

1096
00:54:48,411 --> 00:54:49,704
Where's my mom and dad?

1097
00:54:49,704 --> 00:54:51,164
I can't see them.

1098
00:54:51,164 --> 00:54:53,458
- Don't worry, we'll find them.

1099
00:54:53,458 --> 00:54:56,419
(rotors whirring)

1100
00:54:56,419 --> 00:54:58,546
(screams)

1101
00:55:02,050 --> 00:55:02,884
- Ooh...

1102
00:55:02,884 --> 00:55:03,718
- How is he, Goldie?

1103
00:55:03,718 --> 00:55:05,512
(groaning)

1104
00:55:05,512 --> 00:55:07,472
- I think he's waking up.

1105
00:55:07,472 --> 00:55:10,267
- Good, let's go in for a landing.

1106
00:55:10,267 --> 00:55:11,059
- Hold on!

1107
00:55:13,228 --> 00:55:15,021
- Ta-da, annihilation!

1108
00:55:17,190 --> 00:55:17,983
- Oh!

1109
00:55:21,194 --> 00:55:22,487
(humming "Ride of the Valkyries")

1110
00:55:22,487 --> 00:55:23,238
- Aah!

1111
00:55:30,829 --> 00:55:33,540
- [Peepers] She's going down!

1112
00:55:33,540 --> 00:55:35,750
Abandon ship, abandon ship!

1113
00:55:40,088 --> 00:55:42,299
(laughing)

1114
00:56:01,443 --> 00:56:02,402
- Is it time for the show?

1115
00:56:02,402 --> 00:56:03,862
- King, you're heavy.

1116
00:56:03,862 --> 00:56:07,240
- Show me that stage, and gimme that mic.

1117
00:56:08,825 --> 00:56:10,201
Oooh, where am I?

1118
00:56:11,369 --> 00:56:13,455
- Chanti, you're home.

1119
00:56:13,455 --> 00:56:14,247
- Huh?

1120
00:56:17,959 --> 00:56:22,088
Ooh, I feel like I've been
hit by a 800-pound mule.

1121
00:56:23,298 --> 00:56:24,132
What's happening?

1122
00:56:24,132 --> 00:56:25,091
- There's no time to explain.

1123
00:56:25,091 --> 00:56:27,510
- Chanticleer, you gotta
crow and you gotta crow now.

1124
00:56:27,510 --> 00:56:29,763
- The owls could be here any second.

1125
00:56:29,763 --> 00:56:30,847
- Who are you?

1126
00:56:30,847 --> 00:56:32,807
- He's a friend, now please, crow!

1127
00:56:32,807 --> 00:56:36,311
- Oh, I can't, I don't know if I ever did.

1128
00:56:36,311 --> 00:56:37,520
- Of course you did!

1129
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:39,230
- Chanti, we were wrong.

1130
00:56:39,230 --> 00:56:40,899
- It's your job to bring up the sun.

1131
00:56:40,899 --> 00:56:43,193
- It hasn't shined since you left.

1132
00:56:43,193 --> 00:56:44,903
- Ah, but look.

1133
00:56:44,903 --> 00:56:46,571
(wheezing)

1134
00:56:46,571 --> 00:56:47,697
Cock-a-doo...

1135
00:56:47,697 --> 00:56:48,490
Doo...

1136
00:56:50,158 --> 00:56:51,451
- Uh-oh.

1137
00:56:51,451 --> 00:56:53,870
- Aw, guys, it's no use.

1138
00:56:53,870 --> 00:56:55,914
All I do now is sing the blues.

1139
00:56:55,914 --> 00:56:57,374
Hmph, "the King."

1140
00:56:57,374 --> 00:57:01,169
- We don't want the King,
we want Chanticleer!

1141
00:57:03,338 --> 00:57:04,756
(gasping)

1142
00:57:04,756 --> 00:57:05,590
- The Duke!

1143
00:57:05,590 --> 00:57:07,634
(growls)

1144
00:57:18,603 --> 00:57:21,439
(laughing)

1145
00:57:21,439 --> 00:57:25,568
- I know it's frightfully
impolite to eavesdrop like this,

1146
00:57:27,112 --> 00:57:31,241
but are you by any chance
having trouble with your throat?

1147
00:57:33,618 --> 00:57:34,828
Nothing to say?

1148
00:57:40,917 --> 00:57:42,377
Cock-a-doodle-doo?

1149
00:57:44,087 --> 00:57:44,879
- Stop it!

1150
00:57:46,089 --> 00:57:47,132
Chanti, crow!

1151
00:57:49,092 --> 00:57:49,926
- Shut up, you!

1152
00:57:49,926 --> 00:57:51,386
- Come on, you guys!

1153
00:57:51,386 --> 00:57:52,887
Show him we believe.

1154
00:57:52,887 --> 00:57:54,097
- I told you to be quiet!

1155
00:57:54,097 --> 00:57:57,183
- Chanticleer, Chanticleer, Chanticleer,

1156
00:57:57,183 --> 00:57:59,227
Chanticleer, Chanticleer!

1157
00:58:03,148 --> 00:58:04,357
(choking)

1158
00:58:04,357 --> 00:58:08,486
- Duke, leave him alone,
it's me you want, not him.

1159
00:58:12,031 --> 00:58:14,242
(laughing)

1160
00:58:30,300 --> 00:58:32,510
- Chanticleer...

1161
00:58:32,510 --> 00:58:34,304
Chanticleer.

1162
00:58:34,304 --> 00:58:36,014
- Very stupid, Patou.

1163
00:58:38,266 --> 00:58:41,519
- Chanticleer, Chanticleer, Chanticleer.

1164
00:58:42,937 --> 00:58:43,771
- Look here, quiet!

1165
00:58:43,771 --> 00:58:47,567
- [All] Chanticleer,
Chanticleer, Chanticleer.

1166
00:58:48,776 --> 00:58:51,321
(all chanting)

1167
00:58:53,239 --> 00:58:55,325
- Fools, all of you.

1168
00:58:55,325 --> 00:58:56,117
Silence!

1169
00:58:58,244 --> 00:59:00,371
I'll give you Chanticleer!

1170
00:59:01,664 --> 00:59:05,460
- [All] Chanticleer,
Chanticleer, Chanticleer!

1171
00:59:27,690 --> 00:59:31,486
(maniacal laughter)

1172
00:59:31,486 --> 00:59:34,280
- Look, it's comin' up without him

1173
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:35,823
- You're a phony.

1174
00:59:35,823 --> 00:59:36,658
- Are you by any chance having

1175
00:59:36,658 --> 00:59:39,285
a little trouble with your throat?

1176
00:59:39,285 --> 00:59:40,703
- You're a phony.

1177
00:59:40,703 --> 00:59:42,830
- It's coming up without him.

1178
00:59:42,830 --> 00:59:44,541
- It's your job to bring up the sun.

1179
00:59:44,541 --> 00:59:47,877
- It hasn't shined since you left.

1180
00:59:47,877 --> 00:59:50,421
(gasping)

1181
00:59:50,421 --> 00:59:54,509
- Chanticleer, you gotta
crow and you gotta crow now.

1182
01:00:03,059 --> 01:00:04,352
- Cock-a-dooooo,

1183
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:10,567
Cock-a-dooooo,

1184
01:00:13,736 --> 01:00:14,862
Cock-a-dooooo.

1185
01:00:21,244 --> 01:00:23,371
(yelling)

1186
01:00:35,133 --> 01:00:37,343
(coughing)

1187
01:00:46,978 --> 01:00:47,854
- Hehehehe!

1188
01:00:49,439 --> 01:00:51,899
- Hunch, it's me, Uncle Dukey.

1189
01:00:52,942 --> 01:00:54,068
- Uncle Dukey?

1190
01:00:56,112 --> 01:00:56,904
Come here.

1191
01:00:58,072 --> 01:00:59,198
- Hunch, no!

1192
01:00:59,198 --> 01:01:00,074
(chuckling)

1193
01:01:00,074 --> 01:01:03,286
- Animation, it's music to my ears.

1194
01:01:03,286 --> 01:01:05,580
Hold still, you little twerp!

1195
01:01:05,580 --> 01:01:08,791
Aggravation, abomination, alienation.

1196
01:01:08,791 --> 01:01:11,002
(laughing)

1197
01:01:21,638 --> 01:01:24,557
- [Patou] Well, our journey
had finally come to an end.

1198
01:01:24,557 --> 01:01:28,978
Old Chanticleer was back
to stay, the sun was up,

1199
01:01:28,978 --> 01:01:33,107
the rain had stopped, and
the owls were gone for good.

1200
01:01:35,109 --> 01:01:39,614
Everything seemed to be
turning out just fine,

1201
01:01:39,614 --> 01:01:41,991
except for one thing, Edmond.

1202
01:01:44,952 --> 01:01:47,914
We just didn't know how to help him.

1203
01:02:07,433 --> 01:02:08,393
(gasps)

1204
01:02:08,393 --> 01:02:10,186
- He was a little boy.

1205
01:02:12,563 --> 01:02:15,441
- Oh, he was a handsome little boy.

1206
01:02:17,193 --> 01:02:18,653
Edmond, Edmond...

1207
01:02:24,492 --> 01:02:25,868
- Edmond, Edmond.

1208
01:02:31,207 --> 01:02:31,999
Edmond...

1209
01:02:37,130 --> 01:02:40,341
Edmond, Edmond, come on honey, wake up.

1210
01:02:43,886 --> 01:02:46,264
(whimpering)

1211
01:02:50,768 --> 01:02:51,978
Wake up, honey.

1212
01:02:53,521 --> 01:02:54,397
- Mom, Mom!

1213
01:02:56,399 --> 01:02:58,901
Look, I'm not furry anymore!

1214
01:02:58,901 --> 01:03:00,319
I'm a boy!

1215
01:03:00,319 --> 01:03:02,864
- Lie down, sweetheart.

1216
01:03:02,864 --> 01:03:04,240
- Mom, is that the sun?

1217
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:05,867
- Mm-hmm.

1218
01:03:05,867 --> 01:03:08,661
Edmond, Edmond, get back into bed.

1219
01:03:09,787 --> 01:03:10,621
- Wow.

1220
01:03:10,621 --> 01:03:12,248
- Okay, take a look.

1221
01:03:13,958 --> 01:03:16,586
- Look, Mom, Chanticleer raised the sun.

1222
01:03:16,586 --> 01:03:19,172
- Hi Edmond, how you doing, son?

1223
01:03:19,172 --> 01:03:22,049
- Fine, but what happened
to Chanti and the gang?

1224
01:03:22,049 --> 01:03:23,843
Mom, where are they?

1225
01:03:23,843 --> 01:03:26,888
- Edmond, Chanticleer is just a storybook.

1226
01:03:26,888 --> 01:03:28,931
Those characters are only make-believe.

1227
01:03:28,931 --> 01:03:30,266
Now come on, let's get back to bed.

1228
01:03:30,266 --> 01:03:33,060
- No mom, no they're not, I saw them.

1229
01:03:33,060 --> 01:03:35,521
I bet they're wondering
what happened to me.

1230
01:03:35,521 --> 01:03:37,315
I wanna tell them I'm okay.

1231
01:03:37,315 --> 01:03:38,608
- I'm sure they know.

1232
01:03:38,608 --> 01:03:39,817
- Ypu think so?

1233
01:03:43,154 --> 01:03:44,947
- They'll be just fine.

1234
01:03:44,947 --> 01:03:46,866
- [Patou] Edmond's mom
was right, of course,

1235
01:03:46,866 --> 01:03:48,993
but she didn't know why.

1236
01:03:48,993 --> 01:03:52,622
She also never knew just what
stopped the rain that night,

1237
01:03:52,622 --> 01:03:54,332
but that just goes to show you,

1238
01:03:54,332 --> 01:03:56,501
with a little help from your friends,

1239
01:03:56,501 --> 01:03:58,586
you can do just about anything.

1240
01:03:58,586 --> 01:04:01,255
- Welcome home, Chanticleer.

1241
01:04:01,255 --> 01:04:03,800
Thanks for bringing back the sun.

1242
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:08,262
♫ Cock-a-doooo-doodle-doodle-dooo-dooo

1243
01:04:08,262 --> 01:04:09,388
- [Edmond] Chanticleer!

1244
01:04:09,388 --> 01:04:10,807
- Hey, Edmond!

1245
01:04:10,807 --> 01:04:11,599
Whoowee!

1246
01:04:12,850 --> 01:04:14,852
♫ Cock-a-doo, what a day

1247
01:04:14,852 --> 01:04:16,813
♫ The sun is shinin' brightly,

1248
01:04:16,813 --> 01:04:18,731
♫ Cock-A-doo sunny day,

1249
01:04:18,731 --> 01:04:20,817
♫ Down here on the farm

1250
01:04:20,817 --> 01:04:22,944
♫ Cock-a-doo stay away

1251
01:04:22,944 --> 01:04:24,946
♫ You big ol' wet ol' rain cloud

1252
01:04:24,946 --> 01:04:29,075
♫ Or I'll cry out loud
with this voice of mine

1253
01:04:30,827 --> 01:04:31,911
♫ Sun do shine

1254
01:04:31,911 --> 01:04:34,705
♫ Sun do shine, sun do shine, sun do shine

1255
01:04:34,705 --> 01:04:36,123
♫ Sun do shine

1256
01:04:36,123 --> 01:04:38,918
♫ Sun do shine, sun do shine, sun do shine

1257
01:04:38,918 --> 01:04:40,127
♫ Sun do shine

1258
01:04:40,127 --> 01:04:43,297
♫ Sun do shine, sun do shine, sun do shine

1259
01:04:43,297 --> 01:04:45,258
♫ Well, my daddy taught me how to sing

1260
01:04:45,258 --> 01:04:47,677
♫ And that's why this
voice means everything

1261
01:04:47,677 --> 01:04:50,096
♫ Sun do shine, you better shine

1262
01:04:50,096 --> 01:04:51,180
♫ You better shine

1263
01:04:51,180 --> 01:04:54,100
♫ Well, the sun do shine, you better shine

1264
01:04:54,100 --> 01:05:01,524
♫ You better shine

1265
01:05:01,524 --> 01:05:02,650
♫ Sun do shine

1266
01:05:02,650 --> 01:05:05,361
♫ Sun do shine, sun do shine, sun do shine

1267
01:05:05,361 --> 01:05:06,612
♫ Sun do shine

1268
01:05:06,612 --> 01:05:09,532
♫ Sun do shine, sun do shine, sun do shine

1269
01:05:09,532 --> 01:05:10,575
♫ Well, the sun do shine

1270
01:05:10,575 --> 01:05:13,578
♫ Sun do shine, sun do shine, sun do shine

1271
01:05:13,578 --> 01:05:15,746
♫ Well, my daddy taught me how to sing

1272
01:05:15,746 --> 01:05:18,207
♫ And that's why this
voice means everything

1273
01:05:18,207 --> 01:05:20,668
♫ Sun do shine, you better shine

1274
01:05:20,668 --> 01:05:22,128
♫ You better shine

1275
01:05:22,128 --> 01:05:24,589
♫ Well, the sun do shine, you better shine

1276
01:05:24,589 --> 01:05:31,971
♫ You better shine

1277
01:05:31,971 --> 01:05:36,100
♫ You better shine, Sun, you better shine!

1278
01:05:40,813 --> 01:05:43,941
♫ Digidigidigidowdow!

1279
01:05:45,234 --> 01:05:49,363
♫ tyin' your shoes, tyin' your shoe

1280
01:05:50,406 --> 01:05:52,575
♫ shoe bah doo bah, shoebah,

1281
01:05:52,575 --> 01:05:56,704
♫ Tyin' your shoes, tyin' your shoe

1282
01:05:57,622 --> 01:06:01,459
♫ shoe bah doo bah, tyin' your shoes

1283
01:06:01,459 --> 01:06:05,171
♫ This old dog has paid his dues

1284
01:06:05,171 --> 01:06:08,633
♫ But I can still learn a new trick or two

1285
01:06:08,633 --> 01:06:12,762
♫ 'Cause I've been over,
around, under and through

1286
01:06:12,762 --> 01:06:13,679
♫ Tyin' your shoes

1287
01:06:13,679 --> 01:06:17,558
♫ Life is just like tyin' your shoes

1288
01:06:17,558 --> 01:06:20,269
♫ Now half the world is singin' the blues

1289
01:06:20,269 --> 01:06:21,354
♫ Singin' the blues

1290
01:06:21,354 --> 01:06:24,565
♫ But I've learned if you laugh
you've got nothing to lose

1291
01:06:24,565 --> 01:06:28,194
♫ Cause I've been over,
around, under and through

1292
01:06:28,194 --> 01:06:29,528
♫ Tyin' your shoes

1293

♫ Now when you try

1295

♫ When you try

1296
01:06:35,660 --> 01:06:37,662
♫ Something new

1297
01:06:37,662 --> 01:06:39,538
♫ Now, you're bound to make mistakes

1298
01:06:39,538 --> 01:06:40,831
♫ You'll make mistakes

1299
01:06:40,831 --> 01:06:44,794
♫ Hey, but, no use cryin',
just keep on tryin'

1300

♫ Tyin' your shoes

1302
01:06:49,423 --> 01:06:51,968
♫ Kid, you're never too old to learn

1303
01:06:51,968 --> 01:06:53,135
♫ Tyin' your shoes

1304
01:06:53,135 --> 01:06:56,430
♫ Now I's ready to roll and
I' all ready to burn, you see
