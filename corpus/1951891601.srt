JOHNNY SUEDE

2
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:55,949
"Some people call me a teenage idol

3
00:01:57,075 --> 00:02:02,080
Some people say they envy me..."

4
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:11,089
Some time near the end of the XXth century,
in the depths of a large American city...

5
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:16,053
...there lived a young man named John Beaman.
No one knew where he came from really...

6
00:02:16,053 --> 00:02:22,059
...or where he was going. But it
was clear, at least to him, he was going somewhere.

7
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:28,065
John had just about everything: the look,
the hair, the clothes... everything...

8
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:31,985
except one thing...
shoes.

9
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:38,951
And this made him feel incomplete. As if
he lacked one final crucial thing.

10
00:02:39,076 --> 00:02:43,956
Like a car without wheels, like
a rocket without fuel...

11
00:02:44,081 --> 00:02:51,964
...like a man without shoes. Everyone else seemed
to have it, everyone else seemed complete.

12
00:02:52,089 --> 00:02:59,972
Everyone except him. So he kept
looking for this one thing.

13
00:03:03,058 --> 00:03:09,064
Night after night...
Wandering... searching...

14
00:03:10,065 --> 00:03:15,070
This is the story of what
happened when he found it.

15
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:29,960
 - Hey, man!
- What!?

16
00:03:30,085 --> 00:03:31,962
 - Come in!
- Why!?

17
00:03:32,087 --> 00:03:35,966
 - Come and get the stuff! 
It is good. I'm telling you!

18
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:39,970
 - What's wrong with her?
- She's all right. She's digging it, man!

19
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:42,973
 - Hey, baby!
- See that, man?

20
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:47,978
 - She wants it, man!
Come on over here!

21
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:08,957
 - Yes? Police. 
- Something funny going on...

22
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:12,085
 ..on the corner of Lincoln and the 46.

23
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:19,987
"Some people call me a teenage
idol. Some people say...

24
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:29,371
they envy me. I guess they got no way
of knowing how lonesome I can be.

25
00:05:31,165 --> 00:05:38,964
I need somebody to be my baby
Someone to tell my troubles to

26
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:47,055
I've got no time to ever find her
Cause I'm just passing through.

27
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:54,938
I travel around from town
to lonely town.

28
00:05:55,355 --> 00:06:02,571
I guess I'll always be just
a rolling stone...

29
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:12,247
If I find fortune and fame and
lots of people know my name...

30
00:06:12,581 --> 00:06:15,959
That won't mean a thing
if I'm all alone..."

31
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:36,980
 - Suede is a funny thing.

32
00:06:38,065 --> 00:06:43,987
 It's rough, but soft...
Is strong, but quiet...

33
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:49,952
 It doesn't wrinkle and it doesn't crack...

34
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:54,957
 And it doesn't stand up so much in the crowd of the leather...

35
00:06:57,084 --> 00:07:01,964
 You don't notice it at first but once
you do you can't take your eyes of...

36
00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:06,969
 and you wonder how the hell could
you overlook it in the first place?

37
00:08:59,081 --> 00:09:03,085
 - Who is it?
- It's your father!

38
00:09:09,174 --> 00:09:13,053
 - Hi, Mr. Clepp. How you doing?

39
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:21,061
 - I'm not bothering you?
- No, I've just practiced on my guitar and stuff...

40
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:26,066
 That's good.

41
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:31,989
 Know, I wrote a song once...

42
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:37,953
 It's called "The Rent Song".
Did you ever heard "The Rent Song"?

43
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:41,957
 "The Rent song"? No, I don't think so.

44
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:53,051
 It goes like this: hey, hey, today is the day
those that pay will get to stay.

45
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:58,056
 Those that don't, I hate to say,
they got to pack the shit...

46
00:09:58,056 --> 00:10:03,061
 ..and move, move away...

47
00:10:06,064 --> 00:10:10,068
 Practise that, Caruso.

48
00:10:57,074 --> 00:10:59,076
 - Hey, Johnny!

49
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:08,085
 I'm sorry I missed you last night
I was on the way to club but it's three girls...

50
00:11:08,085 --> 00:11:15,133
 pull up to me, asking me to take them
to the tunel...

51
00:11:15,259 --> 00:11:17,928
 The next thing I know, they're going through the tunnel...

52
00:11:18,053 --> 00:11:27,062
 ..with me still in the car. Ain't that..
they've parked in the woods. Ain't that interesting...?

53
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:32,985
 So how about you, you scored last night?
- What the fuck was I doing, man? Playing hockey?

54
00:11:33,068 --> 00:11:37,990
 - Jesus, what's the matter with you?
- What's the matter with me!? I just pawned my guitar, that's what.

55
00:11:38,073 --> 00:11:39,950
 - Why!?
- So I have something else to eat besides...

56
00:11:40,075 --> 00:11:46,957
 goddamned cabbage!
I tell you, if I had a gun, right now...

57
00:11:47,082 --> 00:11:49,960
 - I'd do something!
- Like what!?

58
00:11:50,085 --> 00:11:56,049
 - Like what? See that barber's shop over there?
I bet there's 300 dollars in the register. We walk in...

59
00:11:56,049 --> 00:12:00,053
 ..show him the gun and he gives us
the cash, right?

60
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:06,059
 - Yeah... Hey, that's not a bad idea, Johnny! 
- I know! I can get my guitar back!

61
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:12,065
 - I can get me a new keyboard!
- I would to start the band!

62
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:17,070
 - So when are we gonna get the band started?
- I just told you, as soon as we get a gun.

63
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:23,076
 Listen! I know the guy, he is a apartment painter.
So like you help me, I split with you 50/50?

64
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:27,080
 - 50/50?

65
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:32,961
 No. These hands weren't made to hold a goddamned paintbrush!

66
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:37,966
 - All right, you know what's the case!
- I do.

67
00:12:44,056 --> 00:12:49,978
 - All right, see you later tonight in the club!
- No, I'm not going.

68
00:12:50,062 --> 00:12:56,985
 Hey man!
Come on, come about 7, sooner or later.

69
00:12:57,069 --> 00:12:59,988
 Johnny? Johnny Suede?

70
00:13:38,068 --> 00:13:39,987
 - Freak! 
 - Slick.

71
00:13:44,074 --> 00:13:46,952
 - We need to talk...
Really, we need to talk.

72
00:13:47,077 --> 00:13:51,957
 - I'd like to talk to you too, Slick, but not right now?
- What do you man can't right now? When?

73
00:13:52,082 --> 00:13:58,964
 - I don't know, man. I'm totally booked!
This record company (...) is on my ass to get this album out.

74
00:13:59,089 --> 00:14:02,968
 - I need my money.
I mean I need my money!

75
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:05,971
 - Yeah, well, I'm sure you do.

76
00:14:10,058 --> 00:14:16,064
 - You know with that shoehorn,
you remind me of a prince in a faery-tale?

77
00:14:17,065 --> 00:14:23,071
 - Well, with this dress remind me
of a strawberry ice cream!

78
00:14:29,077 --> 00:14:32,956
 - Looking for something?
- Yeah, I just ordered a beer and now it's gone.

79
00:14:33,081 --> 00:14:37,961
 - I'll buy you one. May I have a beer, please!
- Thanks.

80
00:14:40,088 --> 00:14:41,965
 - Are you with the band?

81
00:14:44,051 --> 00:14:47,971
 I knew it! They had a show last week.

82
00:14:48,055 --> 00:14:53,977
 - No, we can't play there yet.
- You should. I know my mom's a...

83
00:14:54,061 --> 00:14:56,980
 - a records distibutor.
- Really?

84
00:14:57,064 --> 00:15:07,950
 - Yeah,  but ... because I write a poetry
 ..anyway I'd like to say that music and poetry...

85
00:15:08,075 --> 00:15:12,955
 - ...are alike
- I've always thought so.

86
00:15:14,081 --> 00:15:17,084
 - What's the name of your band again?

87
00:15:19,086 --> 00:15:23,090
 - I'm not supposed to go to that club
- Why not?

88
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:27,052
 - It really upsets, my boyfriend.

89
00:15:28,053 --> 00:15:31,974
 - Who is Flip?
- He is my boyfriend.

90
00:15:49,074 --> 00:15:52,953
 "Glooming darkness like
constant shadows...

91
00:15:53,078 --> 00:16:01,962
 where'er I go to shores afar,
a prince of dreams on horse of white...

92
00:16:02,087 --> 00:16:06,967
 please, bring me a blinding beams of light."

93
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:14,975
 - God, that's beautiful! Listen, I'd better be going
- Why?

94
00:16:15,058 --> 00:16:18,979
 - I don't feel right here with
your boyfriend and all...

95
00:16:19,062 --> 00:16:24,067
 - Yeah, he is pretty jealous
He'd get crazy if he finds you here.

96
00:16:24,067 --> 00:16:29,948
 - Is he coming over?
- I hope not. I'm a little affraid of him.

97
00:16:30,073 --> 00:16:34,953
 - Why?
- He hits me sometimes.

98
00:16:39,082 --> 00:16:41,960
 - Do you think maybe you could stay?

99
00:16:55,057 --> 00:16:59,978
 - What about her boyfriend?
- She's gonna dump him.

100
00:17:00,062 --> 00:17:06,026
 But she's got to take it easy
because the guy's got a temper.

101
00:17:06,151 --> 00:17:09,988
 You know, he hits her and shit, has black and bluemarks on.
- Jesus!

102
00:17:10,072 --> 00:17:14,952
 - What's his kinda problem?
- I don't know, he's just crazy I guess.

103
00:17:15,077 --> 00:17:18,956
 - He's famous photographer, Flip Doubt.
- Flip Doubt?

104
00:17:19,081 --> 00:17:22,960
 - It's what she said.
- What a fucking idiot, man!

105
00:17:23,085 --> 00:17:26,964
 - Yeah, and a fucking idiot lives right across the street.

106
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:32,970
 - Too bad, Johnny! I mean now you've got to start
 sneaking around and shit, man.

107
00:17:33,053 --> 00:17:41,979
 - Are you finished? I don't sneak around, you
know that. Come on. We worked out a schedule.
He'll see her...

108
00:17:42,062 --> 00:17:47,985
 on Monsday, Wednesday and Friday and I
will see her, on Tuesady, Thursday
and Saturday. See?

109
00:17:48,068 --> 00:17:53,949
 - What about Sunday?
- Well, she's leaving for herself(???), you know.

110
00:17:54,074 --> 00:18:02,958
 I was thinkng, if you loan me $40,00
I get back my guitar and we will
have rehearsal on Sunday.

111
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:07,963
 - You're serious?
- Said I'd start the band, that's what I'm gonna do!

112
00:18:08,088 --> 00:18:11,967
 - Yep. You got any songs?
- No!

113
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:18,974
 - No? You better get on it. I got a couple,
but we got it,  we got it going.

114
00:18:19,057 --> 00:18:24,980
 I didn't tell you the best part.
Ready? Toile's mom...

115
00:18:25,063 --> 00:18:28,984
 works for the High Tone Record's producer!

116
00:18:29,067 --> 00:18:34,948
 - That's smooth Johnny!
- But I'm not gonna push it...

117
00:18:35,073 --> 00:18:40,078
 - you know me, Mr. Easy-Going.
- Just let it come to you, Johnny.

118
00:18:40,078 --> 00:18:46,084
 - Let it come to you.
- You're so right. Like a little bird...

119
00:18:46,084 --> 00:18:49,087
 ...a beautiful  little bird.

120
00:19:43,058 --> 00:19:46,061
 Poor guy...

121
00:19:46,061 --> 00:19:49,064
 Doing fine
before I came on.

122
00:19:51,066 --> 00:19:57,072
 Well, Flip, got to say it,
the game only started...

123
00:19:57,072 --> 00:20:03,078
 Don't you know...with an open end?

124
00:20:12,087 --> 00:20:15,048
 Hi, babe!

125
00:20:15,048 --> 00:20:22,055
 - Has anybody ever swept these stairs?
- No, no since I've been here.

126
00:20:23,182 --> 00:20:25,058
 - This is for you.

127
00:20:26,185 --> 00:20:28,061
 - Oh! Wow!

128
00:20:30,063 --> 00:20:32,983
  They are really beautiful.
- I should go now.

129
00:20:33,066 --> 00:20:37,988
 - Why!? You just got here!
- I don't feel well.

130
00:20:39,072 --> 00:20:41,950
 - Are you sick?
- No, I am not sick.

131
00:20:42,075 --> 00:20:47,956
 - Then what's the matter?
- Flip slapped me again last night.

132
00:20:49,082 --> 00:20:52,085
 - What for!?
- No reason.

133
00:20:52,085 --> 00:20:58,050
 - That's it. I'm gonna teach
that fucking scum back about slapping women!
I'm gonna kick the shit out of him!

134
00:20:58,050 --> 00:21:01,053
 - He's got a gun!

135
00:21:16,068 --> 00:21:26,078
 "This is for a never-girl.
The girl I never knew... the one that I pledge to love...

136
00:21:26,161 --> 00:21:31,959
 I promised to be true.

137
00:21:33,085 --> 00:21:42,970
 The one who will never hurt me.
Ear. That one that never...

138
00:21:43,053 --> 00:21:45,973
 I thought about kissing, pleasing...

139
00:21:46,056 --> 00:21:52,980
 And if I ever find her, I know just what I say.

140
00:21:53,063 --> 00:22:04,950
 What I will say. ...to take you far away."

141
00:22:11,081 --> 00:22:19,089
 Not bad! But why we just like gas a tempo, Johnny, like...

142
00:22:23,051 --> 00:22:29,057
 ...it is right now, like: hey, hey...

143
00:22:29,057 --> 00:22:32,728
 "This is for a never-girl. The girl I never knew;
The one who never... I promised to be true...

144
00:22:32,811 --> 00:22:36,982
 - I'll never, I'll never. I'l never..!!"
- No! Hey!

145
00:22:40,068 --> 00:22:41,570
 Ok...

146
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:51,371
 - It's a lovesong, man - Yeah, I know it's a love song
but it's, you know, it's sound is oldfashioned
and we must have new, right? I mean, you know...

147
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:54,708
 - No, wrong! You know I mean I'm not into it now!
Now it's a...

148
00:22:55,125 --> 00:22:57,461
 voice fared in the wind...

149
00:22:57,753 --> 00:23:02,049
 I mean my music just comes out of me, anytime, anywhere

150
00:23:02,049 --> 00:23:04,718
 It's got no date on it!

151
00:23:04,718 --> 00:23:07,179
 <mumble>

152
00:23:07,846 --> 00:23:12,643
 - So you're in love, huh? - Why you said that? - You just said it's a love song.

153
00:23:12,643 --> 00:23:17,064
 - This song is not about me, man! I just made it up..

154
00:23:17,064 --> 00:23:20,067
 Yeah... let's take a break.

155
00:23:21,068 --> 00:23:23,070
 - Ok.

156
00:23:28,075 --> 00:23:32,955
 - Where did you get that plant?
Darlette...

157
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:38,961
 She's.. redoing my apartment, man
for free..! whole thing..!

158
00:23:39,086 --> 00:23:42,965
 - That's nice!
- Yea! And I guess she told old lady about me...

159
00:23:43,298 --> 00:23:45,968
 Now she wants to meet me.

160
00:23:46,051 --> 00:23:52,975
 - Yeah, yeah.. that's cool, you know.. but be careful, man
this one thing I learned from experience, that..

161
00:23:53,058 --> 00:23:57,980
 if your girlfriend mother likes you,
 chances are...

162
00:23:58,063 --> 00:24:02,985
 - ..it's serious, ok?
- Thanks, man. I gotta remember that.

163
00:25:00,083 --> 00:25:02,961
 - Who is this?
- are you kidding?

164
00:25:03,086 --> 00:25:05,964
 Mick Nelson. Great voice, huh?

165
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:10,969
 Yeah... some people say I sound like him.

166
00:25:11,053 --> 00:25:15,974
 - Is it something else you can play?
- Sure is.

167
00:25:30,072 --> 00:25:32,950
 Don't you have anything else?

168
00:25:33,075 --> 00:25:37,955
 - You don't like it?
- Well, it's boring...

169
00:25:39,081 --> 00:25:42,960
 Well, hey, I just take it off than..

170
00:25:44,086 --> 00:25:46,964
 - Jeremy Freak Storm!
- Who?

171
00:25:47,089 --> 00:25:50,968
 - Freak Storm.  He's great! Flip has his records.

172
00:25:51,051 --> 00:25:55,973
 - Never heard of him. ..said this
plant didn't need much attention.

173
00:25:56,056 --> 00:25:57,975
 - Well have you been watering it?

174
00:25:58,058 --> 00:26:02,980
 - Of course I have been watering it! I think
it was dead when you gave it to me.

175
00:26:05,065 --> 00:26:10,988
 - I wouoldn't give you a dead plant!
- Does this plant look dead or not?!

176
00:26:29,089 --> 00:26:30,966
 - Where are you going?

177
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:37,973
 - To grab a beer.
- I will wait up the stairs until you come back...

178
00:26:38,056 --> 00:26:43,979
 - If you want...

179
00:27:16,053 --> 00:27:21,975
 - Where are you from, Johnny?
- Oh no particular place, lady.

180
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:28,982
 - I assume you were born somewhere?
- Dakota. I only lived there a month.

181
00:27:29,066 --> 00:27:34,988
 Like a Rolling Stone. You know, with Dakota
being primarily settled by Swedish emigrants

182
00:27:35,072 --> 00:27:42,955
 I'm wandering if the original pronunciation
of your name isn't Swede. Ian Swede.

183
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:48,961
 No, it's Suede, Mr. Fontaine.
Always has been and always will be.

184
00:27:49,086 --> 00:27:52,965
 - Dalton is not Mr. Fontaine, Johnny.
- Is not?

185
00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:56,969
 ..I'm... I'm a friend, John. I'm ... friend.

186
00:27:58,053 --> 00:28:00,973
 - Where is your dad?
- Gone.

187
00:28:01,056 --> 00:28:04,977
 - Gone?
- Mr. Fountain disappeared shortly before Darlete's 15th birthday.

188
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:08,981
 But a month later the divorce papers arrived post marked 'Buenos Aires'..

189
00:28:09,064 --> 00:28:14,987
 ..and I haven't seen him ever since.

190
00:28:18,073 --> 00:28:21,952
 Well, he's probably living in a tree house
somewhere surrounded by a bare breasted...

191
00:28:22,077 --> 00:28:24,955
 ...young. (??)

192
00:28:26,081 --> 00:28:28,959
 - See I was kind of a lone wolf my day - Oh yeah?

193
00:28:29,084 --> 00:28:35,966
 - Yeah. I randled wild, ...loved hard
- Do you know what I say? - I do.

194
00:28:36,049 --> 00:28:40,053
 Oh, I know you do...

195
00:28:41,054 --> 00:28:44,057
 To the lonely wolf.

196
00:28:44,057 --> 00:28:49,062
 - What they are you toasting?
- Animal behaviour, my dear.

197
00:28:49,062 --> 00:28:53,066
 - Have some coffee.
- Right.

198
00:28:55,068 --> 00:29:00,073
  Mrs. Fontaine, is that
Nancy Sinatra in that picture there?

199
00:29:00,073 --> 00:29:07,080
 - No, that's me
- That's amazing, becasue I thought... you look just like Nancy Sinatra!

200
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:12,085
 - What are you doing with Frankie Lindou?
- Frankie gives High Tone his first record

201
00:29:12,169 --> 00:29:18,050
 -"Let's Live on Love", right?
- ... I thought he was before your time.

202
00:29:18,175 --> 00:29:23,055
 - Well, Mrs. Fountain, good music has no time. That's my philosophy.

203
00:29:24,181 --> 00:29:31,980
 Darlette tells me that you are musician yourself?
What kind of music do you play?

204
00:29:32,064 --> 00:29:38,987
 Well I actually don't have a name for it.
I just pick up my guitar and play whatever comes out as what it is.

205
00:29:39,071 --> 00:29:43,951
 Kind of free form, experimentals..
That's what you're saying, John?

206
00:29:44,076 --> 00:29:47,079
 - Not exactly.
- Johnny has a beautiful voice and...

207
00:29:47,079 --> 00:29:55,087
 ...and he writes songs. - How sweet... 
You've already got a fan. I assume you have a tape?

208
00:29:55,087 --> 00:29:59,049
 - ... 
- Well send it to me next weekend...

209
00:29:59,049 --> 00:30:05,055
 Maybe I can persuade Jack Collins,
our director, to give it a listen.

210
00:30:05,055 --> 00:30:09,059
 - Thank you very much,
- THere's only one thing I ask in return...

211
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:16,066
 It's to let me try on one of those beautiful shoes...

212
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:46,972
 - Babe, what's the matter?
- Darling...

213
00:30:47,055 --> 00:30:53,979
 I told you she hates me. She always has.
Wants to take you away from me.

214
00:30:54,062 --> 00:30:59,067
 - No way, babe! Never happen!
- My father didn't disappear...

215
00:30:59,067 --> 00:31:08,076
 She drove him away!... Because she knew
how much I loved him.

216
00:31:08,076 --> 00:31:15,083
 When I was young I remember staring at the door,
praying that it would open...

217
00:31:16,084 --> 00:31:24,051
 ..and he'd be there to take me away forever
- Oh babe, I'm never gonna leave you, I thought...

218
00:31:26,178 --> 00:31:29,056
 Will you take me home..?

219
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:30,951
 Babe... you look so beautiful, right now

220
00:32:32,077 --> 00:32:33,954
 Thanks.

221
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,957
 - Anymore crackers?
- No...

222
00:32:37,082 --> 00:32:38,959
 No?

223
00:32:48,051 --> 00:32:50,971
 Got anymore tea?

224
00:32:59,062 --> 00:33:02,983
 - Did I ever show you this picture?
- No.

225
00:33:03,066 --> 00:33:09,072
 - Wow, that's a great picture! Who took it?
- Flip.

226
00:33:09,072 --> 00:33:15,078
 We had so much fun dressing up and
taking pictures of each other.

227
00:33:15,078 --> 00:33:25,088
 Yeah..? Babe, it's a little hard to me to understand
how you could be having so much fun with...

228
00:33:25,088 --> 00:33:32,971
 - a guy who's supposed to be beating a shit out of you?
- Well, I'm sorry Johnny! But we had fun.

229
00:33:33,055 --> 00:33:37,976
 - What do you want me to say?
- Well maybe I should slap you a couple times...

230
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:42,981
 - and we'll have some fun too?
- I can't believe that you said that!

231
00:33:43,065 --> 00:33:49,988
 - I was just joking. I'd never...
- It's over, Johnny.

232
00:33:50,072 --> 00:33:57,955
 - What!?
- I can't pretend anymore. I don't love you.

233
00:34:00,082 --> 00:34:04,962
 I'm sorry Johnny but I won't be able to see you again.

234
00:34:05,087 --> 00:34:07,965
 - No!
- Good bye, Johnny!

235
00:36:07,084 --> 00:36:10,963
 - So you're in a relationship yet?
- No, not yet, but I'm working on it.

236
00:36:11,088 --> 00:36:12,965
 - Good for you.
It's just a matter of time.

237
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:16,969
 - Oh yeah, she's out there... somewhere...

238
00:36:17,469 --> 00:36:23,976
 - Know what? You're right, she is out there. In fact
I just saw her in the next train-coach,

239
00:36:24,059 --> 00:36:29,064
 dressed up like Cinderella, asking everybody
if he's seen a stupid fucking idiot who looks like you.

240
00:36:48,083 --> 00:36:50,961
 - Hey! What the hell are you doing? Huh?

241
00:36:55,048 --> 00:36:57,968
 - Man! I'm gonna get you for that.
- Shut up!

242
00:36:58,051 --> 00:37:04,975
 - You wait, sucker! you better die!
- Next time you keep your nose out
of other people's bussines.

243
00:37:09,062 --> 00:37:12,983
 - Hey! you alright? you ok?
- Keep away your fucking ass, pal!

244
00:37:13,066 --> 00:37:16,987
 - What!?
- You're .. fucking man, picking up a little goddamned hands!

245
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:20,949
 - That wasn't a kid that was a guy trying to get up your dress!
- Get the fuck out of here!

246
00:37:21,074 --> 00:37:25,954
 - He got an antenna trying to lift up your dress!
- I haven't seen any fucking antenna! Where?

247
00:37:28,081 --> 00:37:32,961
 You didn't see any antenna and nothing happened here
and your underwear, excuse me for saying so..

248
00:37:33,086 --> 00:37:36,965
 ...is not white with a little blue rabbits on!

249
00:37:39,051 --> 00:37:40,969
 Hey!

250
00:37:41,053 --> 00:37:43,972
 - Hey, what!?
- I'm sorry, ok? I'm sorry I thought that...

251
00:37:44,056 --> 00:37:49,978
 - you pushed him down the stairs, I'm sorry
- No, I didn't push him. He trooped over my foot.

252
00:37:50,062 --> 00:37:52,981
 Good he haven't got any knife you know?

253
00:37:53,065 --> 00:37:57,986
 I'm not worried about knives.
But these shoes are pretty light...

254
00:38:01,073 --> 00:38:06,954
 - What are these, bedroom slippers?
- No, they are not bedroom slippers. Look!

255
00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:11,959
 One of the kind - black suede shoes.
My name is Suede, by the way.

256
00:38:12,084 --> 00:38:15,963
 - Johnny Suede.
- You're kidding me, right?

257
00:38:16,088 --> 00:38:20,968
 - No, I'm not kidding.. why would I be kidding?
- Yvonne!

258
00:38:23,053 --> 00:38:24,972
 - Ok!

259
00:38:25,055 --> 00:38:29,977
 - That's a name you got, Yvonne?
- Yes. What, what about it?

260
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:31,979
 Yvonne...

261
00:38:33,063 --> 00:38:36,984
 I knew a girl named Yvonne.
She was a dancer in the Blue Bar.

262
00:38:37,067 --> 00:38:42,072
 - Yvonne!
- I gotta go.

263
00:38:42,072 --> 00:38:45,075
 - Who is that guy?
- It's...

264
00:38:46,076 --> 00:38:48,078
 ..a friend.

265
00:38:48,078 --> 00:38:52,082
 See, I was just gonna say
you looks kinda like a friend.

266
00:38:53,083 --> 00:38:58,088
 I gotta go. My band's practising
cross the street.

267
00:38:58,088 --> 00:39:00,048
 Ok.

268
00:39:00,048 --> 00:39:06,054
 Maybe you'd like to come by?
- I am, but I can't. I gotta go.

269
00:39:06,054 --> 00:39:13,061
 Alright. But do me a favor, try to be a little more
careful because I hate to say it there are guys around here..

270
00:39:13,187 --> 00:39:17,065
 ..that would like to do a lot more that looking up your dress.

271
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:20,068
 Take care.

272
00:39:35,083 --> 00:39:38,962
 Hey, guys, I'm sorry I'm late, you're not gonna believe what happened.

273
00:39:39,087 --> 00:39:43,967
 I'm going in in the subway, this crazy guy
pulls a nailbomb this long...

274
00:39:44,051 --> 00:39:47,054
 - What you do man?
- Kicked that fucker right down the stairs!

275
00:39:47,054 --> 00:39:50,057
 - ...got man pushed down the train last night.

276
00:39:50,057 --> 00:39:54,061
 - Killed?
- Cut his arm off!

277
00:39:54,061 --> 00:39:58,065
 - I've seen a cat cut in half, once. - Saw it happened?

278
00:39:58,065 --> 00:40:03,070
 - No, but I've seen putting him in the bags, though
- Alright boys, let's make some music!

279
00:40:04,071 --> 00:40:07,074
 We start at...

280
00:40:07,074 --> 00:40:09,076
 One and two...

281
00:40:11,078 --> 00:40:13,080
 Hold it guys.

282
00:40:14,081 --> 00:40:19,086
 Hi! You showed up! Have a seat!

283
00:40:20,170 --> 00:40:28,053
 Guys, this is this is Yvonne. Yvonne
this is B-Bop, a baseman, over here we got Conan...

284
00:40:28,178 --> 00:40:33,976
 ..the King of Acordeon, and over here is Deke
my right-hand man... ok?

285
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:37,980
 Deke, give me some rocky beat.

286
00:42:35,055 --> 00:42:41,979
 - You're coming, Johnny?
- No, I'm gonna stick around. I call you later!

287
00:42:52,072 --> 00:42:57,953
 - So what do you think?
- Is there a phone round here?
I really should call my friend!

288
00:42:58,078 --> 00:43:05,961
 - Come on, I can take criticism...
- Well... I don't... really...

289
00:43:06,086 --> 00:43:12,968
 Forget it. I know what you're trying to say.
I agree with you.These guys are terrible!

290
00:43:15,053 --> 00:43:22,060
 Even Deke, he's no help... He thinks being
in band is all fun and games!

291
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:28,066
 I write all the songs,
I set up all the rehearsals, God...

292
00:43:29,067 --> 00:43:35,240
 - I mean the way I feel right now I'm ready
to give all the thing up!..
- Don't you dare!

293
00:43:35,324 --> 00:43:40,704
 - Why not?
- I liked the song. I'm not really sure...

294
00:43:40,829 --> 00:43:47,961
 ..what is it about, but I liked it.
I just say you guys need a little more practise, that's all

295
00:43:49,087 --> 00:43:52,966
 - You've got a pretty good voice!
 - Yeah?

296
00:43:53,050 --> 00:43:54,968
 I think so.

297
00:43:55,052 --> 00:44:01,975
 Yeah... yeah, you're right! I am being too hard
on these guys!

298
00:44:02,059 --> 00:44:07,981
 Yeah... I just can't help it, I mean, this is my life!...

299
00:44:09,066 --> 00:44:15,072
 You know what I can tell about you? You really got good head on the shoulders.

300
00:44:15,072 --> 00:44:20,077
 - Do I?
- Yea, I like that...

301
00:44:25,082 --> 00:44:30,963
 Seat down pal, I've got a secret news!
Corina's brother's getting married...

302
00:44:31,088 --> 00:44:33,549
 ..and wants us to play on the wedding!
50 $ a piece!

303
00:44:33,632 --> 00:44:37,553
 That's great, man! That's great!
Eee.. The B-bop called you?

304
00:44:37,636 --> 00:44:39,346
 No, why?

305
00:44:39,346 --> 00:44:44,351
 Cause he's saying he's got this kick on a cruiseship
and he's like leaving tomorrow...

306
00:44:44,351 --> 00:44:47,980
 - For how long?
- Three months.

307
00:44:50,065 --> 00:44:52,985
 Unbelievable!

308
00:44:53,068 --> 00:44:55,988
 Just when things are starting to click, you know..!

309
00:44:57,072 --> 00:45:02,953
 - Yea, but can't we do a gig without?
- No, I'm not playing without a goddamned base-player!

310
00:45:03,078 --> 00:45:07,958
 I guess, I can tell the photographer that we will paint the studio?...

311
00:45:08,083 --> 00:45:13,964
 - Without me - I'm sick of that shit!
- Well I guess it's a time we took a trip

312
00:45:14,089 --> 00:45:19,052
 - to a barbershop...
- What are you talking about, man?

313
00:45:19,052 --> 00:45:23,015
 Barbershop? ...have
some good news!

314
00:45:23,015 --> 00:45:26,018
 That's what I'm trying to tell you, Johnny!

315
00:45:33,025 --> 00:45:34,943
 Is it loaded?

316
00:45:36,028 --> 00:45:37,946
 No, I didn't  have any bullets.

317
00:45:38,030 --> 00:45:41,950
 Ok. We got to find a bullets...

318
00:45:42,034 --> 00:45:46,955
 ..for 38. That'sa plan, ok?

319
00:45:49,041 --> 00:45:55,964
 - ...hold on to it
- Ok...

320
00:46:00,052 --> 00:46:02,971
 So let's go to the club tonight
knowing that you're free man again!

321
00:46:03,055 --> 00:46:05,974
 - I got plans tonight.
- You're seeing Darlette?

322
00:46:06,058 --> 00:46:10,979
 - Yvonne.
- I just think I will place tonight and have dinner...

323
00:46:11,063 --> 00:46:14,983
 You know, I met a schoolteacher once, man
- She's a not schoolteacher!

324
00:46:15,067 --> 00:46:19,988
 She works with retarded kids and shit.
I mean that's a big difference.

325
00:46:22,074 --> 00:46:27,079
 He said that he was gonna divorce his wife but
waited for the right time, you know...

326
00:46:27,079 --> 00:46:33,919
 ..years later, he was still waiting
so I just left, I didn't even

327
00:46:34,086 --> 00:46:40,926
 say goodbye, leave a note or anything
Did you ever lived with anybody?

328
00:46:41,009 --> 00:46:45,931
 Yeah, sure! Say, this is some good meal, you know!

329
00:46:46,014 --> 00:46:49,935
 - It's not even done!
- Of course it is  done!

330
00:46:50,018 --> 00:46:53,939
 - I put it back in the oven.

331
00:46:56,024 --> 00:46:59,945
 - Know what? That's ok! Because...

332
00:47:00,028 --> 00:47:03,949
 ..it's getting late and I should be moving along!

333
00:47:05,033 --> 00:47:09,955
 - It's 9:30!
- Hard to believe, isn't it?

334
00:47:11,039 --> 00:47:15,961
 - Did I say something wrong?
- No... no!

335
00:47:16,044 --> 00:47:19,965
 I just have lot on my mind,
that's all.

336
00:47:20,048 --> 00:47:23,969
  ...B-bop is really upseting and...

337
00:47:24,052 --> 00:47:29,975
 - Oh well, ok. Well, thanks for coming up.
- Thank you! I will call you and...

338
00:47:29,975 --> 00:47:36,982
 we'll do it again, sometime... How come you got
black and blue marks on you?

339
00:47:40,027 --> 00:47:44,907
 - Kids. They're carried away sometimes
- Kids did that to you?! I hope you smacked them back!

340
00:47:45,032 --> 00:47:52,915
 - That's it, you know... popped as I am..
- No, you didn't?! God! It's really funny!

341
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:55,918
 I guess I'm in a funny mood.

342
00:47:56,043 --> 00:47:58,921
 - Ok... So Long! - So long!

343
00:48:03,008 --> 00:48:06,929
  (??) ...real kissing.

344
00:48:08,013 --> 00:48:10,933
 Mine as well.

345
00:48:17,022 --> 00:48:20,943
 - So I'll see you!
- Bye.

346
00:48:32,037 --> 00:48:38,919
 - I find that I obtain, girl
-É? Hold on a second. - Why?

347
00:48:42,047 --> 00:48:44,007
 My turn.

348
00:48:52,015 --> 00:48:54,017
 Ok.

349
00:49:12,119 --> 00:49:15,038
 - Eee... hold it..! - What!?

350
00:49:17,124 --> 00:49:21,044
 - What are you doing?
- What's it feel like I'm doing?

351
00:49:22,129 --> 00:49:28,010
 - Well, it feels like you're trying to pick up a watermelon, see...
- Well, do it your-damned-self, than!.

352
00:49:28,135 --> 00:49:29,928
 - Come here. - What!?

353
00:49:30,012 --> 00:49:32,931
 _ Come here, give me a hand...
Come here...

354
00:49:41,023 --> 00:49:43,942
 - Ok, you feel that?
- Yes.

355
00:49:44,026 --> 00:49:46,028
 That's my lip.

356
00:49:46,028 --> 00:49:48,030
 Ok?

357
00:49:51,033 --> 00:49:53,035
 You feel that?

358
00:49:56,038 --> 00:49:58,040
 That's it.

359
00:50:01,043 --> 00:50:05,047
 This is it... and this is not it..!

360
00:50:05,047 --> 00:50:11,011
 - This is it but this is not.
- Yes.

361
00:50:18,143 --> 00:50:22,856
 See, what I made my mistake with Darlette
is I let her see my hand...

362
00:50:23,023 --> 00:50:26,985
 I mean as soon as she found out that I like her...

363
00:50:27,110 --> 00:50:31,156
 - ...she flew like a goddamned bird. - She will sit on the ground one day.

364
00:50:31,198 --> 00:50:39,414
 - I know she will. But my point is that I learned
an extremaly valueable lesson here...

365
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:48,090
 - now with Yvonne, I can take it or leave it.
- Yes, man, that's right, that's the way it is, Johnny!
Just let them come to you.

366
00:50:48,257 --> 00:50:55,264
 I went to the class the other day,
you know, just to take a glimpse of her lifestyle...

367
00:50:55,389 --> 00:51:02,771
 ...and the moment I went in the kids start
crawling all over me, messing up my clothes, messing up my hair...

368
00:51:02,896 --> 00:51:13,031
 ...and than this girl comes up, with no reason
reaping my favourite shirt! You know, I was so pissed.
I just get out of there...

369
00:51:13,031 --> 00:51:17,035
 - I didn't even say goodbye, you know
- Take it or leave it, right?

370
00:51:17,035 --> 00:51:24,042
 - Exactly! And that's the way
I'm handling this one, man!

371
00:51:24,042 --> 00:51:28,797
 - You're not making love?
- Of course we're making love!..

372
00:51:28,922 --> 00:51:38,932
 - You just see me the other night, man
I was like a wild man,
I was doing all kinds of things! - Like what?

373
00:51:39,016 --> 00:51:46,940
 - Like, well... she showed me where that little button is
inside there, you know... - You didn't know where that was?

374
00:51:47,024 --> 00:51:53,947
 Yeah, I knew where it was.
But know I can find it in the dark if I have to! And that...

375
00:51:54,031 --> 00:51:57,910
 ..is a good thing for a guy to know!

376
00:51:59,036 --> 00:52:04,041
 - You know, Johnny, I'm glad we had this conversation. - Anytime.

377
00:52:04,041 --> 00:52:10,047
 I'm sorry man, I didn't mean to laugh but...
I am really glad we had this conversation..

378
00:52:10,047 --> 00:52:12,007
 Me to.

379
00:53:00,013 --> 00:53:05,936
 Turn on your TV, quick!
There's a cowboy movie on with nobody <adult?>

380
00:53:06,019 --> 00:53:06,937
 That's only kids, man!

381
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:10,941
 - Yeah man, wven the horses are matched!
- I'll look...

382
00:53:11,024 --> 00:53:14,903
 Damn! You just missed it!
It's over.

383
00:53:19,032 --> 00:53:21,910
 Yea, I'm almost ready.

384
00:53:22,911 --> 00:53:26,915
 You didn't tell anyone of the meeting? Not? Good.

385
00:53:29,459 --> 00:53:32,921
 Just yell up to the window when you get here...

386
00:53:40,929 --> 00:53:43,932
 - Who is it?
- Yvonne!

387
00:53:43,932 --> 00:53:45,934
 God!

388
00:53:46,935 --> 00:53:48,937
 I'm coming.

389
00:53:55,027 --> 00:53:57,905
 Hi! What a great surprise!

390
00:53:58,030 --> 00:54:00,908
 - Am I disturbing you?
- No! Go in.

391
00:54:05,037 --> 00:54:10,918
 I'm just getting ready to go out with friends
You just happened to be in the neighbourhood?

392
00:54:11,001 --> 00:54:15,923
 - No, I planned this actually. - Good.

393
00:54:18,008 --> 00:54:21,929
 - Hairdrier?
- Yeah, doesn't work though.

394
00:54:22,012 --> 00:54:31,939
 - Too bad. Listen, are you avoiding me?
- Why would I be avoiding you? No, god!

395
00:54:31,939 --> 00:54:38,904
 - Cause I haven't heard from you in a week.
- Well I've been really busy! you know...

396
00:54:38,904 --> 00:54:42,908
 ...practicing! 
Are you still pissed about Ginger reaping your shirt?

397
00:54:42,908 --> 00:54:47,913
 No, no... I mean I was pissed, you know
for a second, it's my favourite shirt.

398
00:54:48,747 --> 00:54:52,918
 Well... she made this for you.

399
00:54:57,005 --> 00:54:59,925
 It's really  nic-...
SORRY I RIP YOU SHIT

400
00:55:00,008 --> 00:55:05,931
 Now, it's not funny. She reaps my shirt and calls me a shit. Chocking.

401
00:55:06,014 --> 00:55:09,935
 It's supposed to by shirt, you see: I'm sorry I ripped you shirt.

402
00:55:11,019 --> 00:55:13,939
 Oh, that's very nice.

403
00:55:15,023 --> 00:55:18,902
 And this is from me and rest of the class...

404
00:55:19,027 --> 00:55:22,823
 - Johnny?!
- Just a sec...

405
00:55:27,911 --> 00:55:29,913
 Hey, Steve, I'll be down in a second!

406
00:55:29,913 --> 00:55:33,917
 Come on! The girl's legs are getting cold!

407
00:56:06,033 --> 00:56:07,910
 Hi!

408
00:56:10,037 --> 00:56:14,917
 - What happened to your friends?
- I remembered I didn't like them very much.

409
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:22,841
 And I thought: hell, I haven't seen you for a while
, maybe I can go up here and take a ride...

410
00:56:22,925 --> 00:56:27,804
 - Oh, thanks but I've already eaten
- Oh no, I meant dancing!

411
00:56:27,930 --> 00:56:34,812
 - No, I get to get up in the morning
 - We'll not stay late and I'll have you home in a flash..

412
00:56:34,937 --> 00:56:38,941
 I'll wait out here while you get dressed..

413
00:56:38,941 --> 00:56:40,901
 What are you fucking choir-boy (?) ?

414
00:56:53,914 --> 00:56:55,916
 Ok!

415
00:56:55,916 --> 00:56:57,918
 - Ready?
- What!?

416
00:56:57,918 --> 00:57:03,924
 - Don't you wanna put that black stuff around your eyes?
- Eyeliner?

417
00:57:03,924 --> 00:57:06,927
 - All the girls wear it in the club.
Pretty sexy.

418
00:57:06,927 --> 00:57:10,931
 - Well I don't wear eyeliner.
- Really? Why not?

419
00:57:11,014 --> 00:57:12,933
 I don't like it.

420
00:57:13,016 --> 00:57:15,936
 That's a pretty good reason.

421
00:57:16,019 --> 00:57:19,940
 - Which shoes should I wear?
- One you want.

422
00:57:20,023 --> 00:57:23,902
 - Do you like these?
- Yes, they're alright.

423
00:57:24,027 --> 00:57:25,904
 Or do you like these better?

424
00:57:26,029 --> 00:57:30,909
 Babe, you were dressing yourself long before I came on
so why stop now?

425
00:57:31,034 --> 00:57:36,915
 - Only asking which of these you like
- And I'm just saying. Wear the ones you like best, ok?!

426
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:43,922
 - Why just you don't tell which shoes you like better? - Cause I guess I don't like either ones.

427
00:57:45,007 --> 00:57:49,928
 Those are fucking shoes that I have, ok?
This is the way I dress and you know, goddamned what I wear...

428
00:57:50,012 --> 00:57:52,931
 - ...shit around my eyes!
- Ok!

429
00:57:53,015 --> 00:57:55,934
 - What's the big deal?
- No big deal.

430
00:57:57,019 --> 00:57:59,938
 - Let's just stop seeing each other, right?
- Why!?

431
00:58:00,022 --> 00:58:10,908
 - Because it's very obvious to me there's nothing
about me that you wants!- If it is so obvious,
what the hell am I doing standing here, than?

432
00:58:13,035 --> 00:58:20,918
 - I don't have any idea.
- Well, I guess I have to spell it out for you!
I'm standing here...

433
00:58:24,004 --> 00:58:25,923
 ..because I like you!

434
00:58:26,006 --> 00:58:28,926
 ...it's a funny way you're showing it.

435
00:58:33,013 --> 00:58:36,934
 - It is ok?
- No.

436
00:58:43,023 --> 00:58:44,900
 Sabe?

437
00:58:48,028 --> 00:58:52,908
 You've got kind of eyes that
don't need any make-up at all!

438
00:58:56,036 --> 00:58:58,914
 - Shut up.
- I'm serious.

439
00:58:59,039 --> 00:59:03,919
 Look, hey! I'm serious. You're beautiful.

440
00:59:05,003 --> 00:59:07,923
 I'm sorry I've threw a shoe at you.

441
00:59:08,006 --> 00:59:19,935
 It's ok. It's all right. Just please don't do it again
cause I hate when people throw shoes at me.

442
00:59:20,018 --> 00:59:21,937
 I won't.

443
00:59:42,040 --> 00:59:44,918
 Wise person who was missed...

444
00:59:50,007 --> 00:59:52,926
 - Get a smoke?
- No, I'm out.

445
01:00:10,027 --> 01:00:12,905
 You Freak Storm, huh?

446
01:00:13,030 --> 01:00:17,910
 That's right. I've seen you before!
What's your name?

447
01:00:18,035 --> 01:00:20,913
 John. Johnny Suede.

448
01:00:22,915 --> 01:00:26,919
 - What are you doing back here, Freak?
- Meet someone that I wanna see.

449
01:00:26,919 --> 01:00:33,926
 - Nice shoes you have here, Johnny.
- Thanks. I like your boots.

450
01:00:34,009 --> 01:00:37,930
 - Where did you get them?
- I found them when I was living in Wyomming.

451
01:00:39,014 --> 01:00:42,935
 - What were you doing in Wyomming?
- I've been all over, man.

452
01:00:43,018 --> 01:00:44,937
 - Me too
- Yeah?

453
01:00:48,023 --> 01:00:51,902
 - I was born in a goddamned motel room
- Really?

454
01:00:52,027 --> 01:00:56,907
 - Your dad was a traveling sellsman.
- Daddy?

455
01:00:58,033 --> 01:01:02,913
 I don't know too much about my daddy, man except
he was shot 5 minutes after I was born.

456
01:01:03,038 --> 01:01:06,917
 - Wow, you're kiddin!
- No, I am not fucking kidding.

457
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:12,923
 Even tried to write a song about it, once.
But I just didn't finish it.

458
01:01:14,007 --> 01:01:15,926
 It goes like this...

459
01:01:19,012 --> 01:01:28,939
 I was born in motel room
When my daddy lost his job.

460
01:01:29,940 --> 01:01:37,906
 Just after one
He pulled a gun and blew the brain down the...

461
01:01:38,031 --> 01:01:42,911
 They call me mamma'.. they call me mamma'...

462
01:01:43,036 --> 01:01:49,918
 The call me mamma's boy. But I don't care.

463
01:01:50,002 --> 01:01:57,926
 I'll be a mamma, I'll be a mamma's boy!

464
01:01:58,010 --> 01:02:04,933
 Since daddy get the electric chair!

465
01:02:08,020 --> 01:02:13,484
 - Pretty music, Freak.
- No, it ain't. It's all piece of bubble.

466
01:02:13,567 --> 01:02:19,907
 - No man, you should finish it. - I can't, it's too very personal.

467
01:02:21,033 --> 01:02:23,911
 Did your daddy really get a chair?

468
01:02:23,911 --> 01:02:28,916
 - Well Johnny I don't really like talking about that.
- I can understand that.

469
01:02:30,918 --> 01:02:34,922
 - You really liked that song Johnny?
- Yeah, I do like...

470
01:02:34,922 --> 01:02:36,924
 - You can have it.

471
01:02:36,924 --> 01:02:38,926
 - Thanks!

472
01:02:38,926 --> 01:02:41,929
 Thanks, Freak.

473
01:02:42,012 --> 01:02:44,932
 - You know I'm trying to start a band myself.
- You do that? - Yeah!

474
01:02:45,015 --> 01:02:48,936
 The High Tone was interested for a while
but that didn't go through.

475
01:02:49,019 --> 01:02:51,939
 - I sympathize with that
- It's hard you know.

476
01:02:52,022 --> 01:02:57,903
 - I sympathize
- Sometims I feel like giving up

477
01:02:58,028 --> 01:03:01,907
 - Do you, Johnny?
- Yea, I do Freak.

478
01:03:03,033 --> 01:03:07,913
 I like you. Wanna turn you on for something.
Check this out.

479
01:03:08,038 --> 01:03:09,915
 What is it?

480
01:03:11,041 --> 01:03:12,918
 MAKE YOUR OWN HIT ALBUM - $20 - CALL RUDY AT HIT-12345

481
01:03:13,001 --> 01:03:17,923
 This guy, Rudy, is a friend...
to my first album.

482
01:03:19,007 --> 01:03:21,093
 You got a tape?

483
01:03:21,176 --> 01:03:24,930
 -Well send it to him right away, make sure you send cash (...)

484
01:03:24,930 --> 01:03:26,932
 Wait a minute!

485
01:03:27,933 --> 01:03:32,938
 I'm gonna go and see this guy tomorrow.
If you give me the money than I can give it to him.

486
01:03:32,938 --> 01:03:35,941
 Hey, that's great! That's fine by my!

487
01:03:38,902 --> 01:03:40,904
 I got it!

488
01:03:43,907 --> 01:03:45,909
 - You give it to him, man
- Why!?

489
01:03:45,909 --> 01:03:50,497
 I don't want to bother with that... Oh hell I'll give it to him!
I'll tell him you're a friend of mine.

490
01:03:50,706 --> 01:03:54,918
 - Special treatment.
-Yes...

491
01:03:55,002 --> 01:03:57,921
 Thanks. That's great!

492
01:03:58,005 --> 01:04:01,925
 Don't mention it!
Maybe one day you can make me a favor.

493
01:04:02,009 --> 01:04:06,930
 - Here! Have some chicken!
- I can't, Freak! I gotta split.

494
01:04:08,015 --> 01:04:09,933
 - You have to split?

495
01:04:10,017 --> 01:04:14,938
 I start your fucking career for you and you gotta split?!

496
01:04:15,022 --> 01:04:17,941
 That's why your life's going fucking nowhere Johnny! Cause you gotta show a little bit goddamned gratitude!

497
01:04:18,025 --> 01:04:20,903
 - No, I am grateful, Freak! Really!

498
01:04:21,028 --> 01:04:22,821
 I am.

499
01:04:26,909 --> 01:04:32,915
 - This is good chicken.
- It should be man I only found it this morning.

500
01:04:32,915 --> 01:04:34,917
 Just kidding.

501
01:04:41,924 --> 01:04:48,931
 "I was born in motel room
When my daddy lost his job.

502
01:04:48,931 --> 01:04:56,939
 Just after one
He pulled a gun, his brain out...

503
01:04:57,022 --> 01:05:07,908
 Cops pulling me down the...
(...)

504
01:05:12,204 --> 01:05:17,918
 That was the day my mamma told, since I could understand

505
01:05:21,421 --> 01:05:27,803
 ...could take no pride,
and the daddy killed a man.

506
01:05:27,928 --> 01:05:32,933
 They call me mamma..mamma...mamma's boy.

507
01:05:32,933 --> 01:05:40,941
 But hey, I just don't care! I've been a mamma...mamma..mamma's boy...

508
01:05:40,941 --> 01:05:44,903
 Since daddy
got the electric chair."

509
01:06:46,924 --> 01:06:48,926
 - I'll make some tea.

510
01:07:02,940 --> 01:07:04,900
 - She still loves you...

511
01:07:04,900 --> 01:07:08,904
 - Does she?
- She talks about you all the time.

512
01:08:22,019 --> 01:08:25,939
 - I told you I'd get you, didn't I?!

513
01:08:27,024 --> 01:08:28,901
 - Johnny...

514
01:08:33,030 --> 01:08:37,910
 - How do you feel?
- Terrible.

515
01:08:40,037 --> 01:08:45,918
 - What's that smell?
- I made some soup. Do you want some?

516
01:08:46,001 --> 01:08:49,922
 - What type?
- Vegetable.

517
01:08:50,005 --> 01:08:54,927
 - What type of vegetables?
- Do you want some soup or not?

518
01:08:57,012 --> 01:08:59,932
 - Ok, I'll have some soup.

519
01:09:03,018 --> 01:09:06,939
 - Aren't you supposed to be in school?
- Yeah...

520
01:09:07,022 --> 01:09:09,900
 I took a day off.

521
01:09:16,031 --> 01:09:21,912
 - I hope you know shaving the face is not like shaving legs
- Why it says this?

522
01:09:23,038 --> 01:09:26,917
 - Already made this before?
- Once or twice...

523
01:09:29,002 --> 01:09:33,924
 - With that married guy?
- Why are you so curious?

524
01:09:36,009 --> 01:09:41,932
 - Have you guys been in tub?
- No, we were in a jacuzzi.

525
01:09:42,015 --> 01:09:47,938
 - Anything else you wanna tell me?
- Only this: you keep asking me a stupid questions...

526
01:09:48,021 --> 01:09:52,901
 - and I'm gonna smack you!
- Big talk for a girl..!

527
01:09:53,026 --> 01:10:00,909
 - ...

528
01:10:01,034 --> 01:10:02,911
 ...

529
01:10:10,002 --> 01:10:11,920
 God...

530
01:10:16,008 --> 01:10:17,926
 Funny...

531
01:10:23,932 --> 01:10:27,936
 - I hope you know shaving a leg
is not like shaving a face.

532
01:10:27,936 --> 01:10:31,940
  ...I've done this a million times...

533
01:10:36,028 --> 01:10:39,907
 - You're going a wrong way.
- Look, lady.

534
01:10:40,032 --> 01:10:43,911
 You go your way, I go my way.

535
01:10:51,001 --> 01:10:52,920
 I love you, Johnny.

536
01:10:57,007 --> 01:10:58,926
 Thanks.

537
01:11:05,015 --> 01:11:06,934
 Certain.

538
01:11:07,017 --> 01:11:12,940
 - For moving...
...against moving.

539
01:11:13,023 --> 01:11:18,904
 I'd suggest that you start with the reasons for moving
 ???.

540
01:11:19,029 --> 01:11:22,908
 - So let me have a couple! - Ok...

541
01:11:22,908 --> 01:11:29,915
 - She's got a color TV.
- Here you go! Color TV... Next?!

542
01:11:35,587 --> 01:11:40,926
 - She's got an extra room. She says I can play my guitar in
, kind like my own private room.

543
01:11:41,009 --> 01:11:43,929
 - That's nice!... private room...

544
01:11:47,015 --> 01:11:52,938
 - Next!
- She's always got things around to eat...

545
01:11:53,021 --> 01:11:55,941
 like nuts, come crackers and shit...

546
01:11:56,024 --> 01:11:59,903
 - Hey, why you watch TV? You know what I'm saying?

547
01:12:00,028 --> 01:12:02,906
 - Yeah...
- So.. we call it snacks!

548
01:12:04,032 --> 01:12:05,909
 - Anything else?

549
01:12:07,035 --> 01:12:10,914
 - Nope, no.
- Let's proceed to the reasons against!

550
01:12:11,039 --> 01:12:15,919
 - I'd move into, I'd be locked up for 24 hours a day!
You know, go to bed...

551
01:12:16,003 --> 01:12:18,922
 there she is,
wake up - there she is again!

552
01:12:19,006 --> 01:12:23,927
 - So you say you're feeling like a...
- ...like I was in prison!

553
01:12:24,928 --> 01:12:28,932
 - Ok... prison.... -similarities!

554
01:12:28,932 --> 01:12:31,935
 - Good.
- Next..?

555
01:12:31,935 --> 01:12:40,903
 I couldn't do any of the things the guys does, you know...
I mean... say, I wanna walk around in my underwear!

556
01:12:40,903 --> 01:12:45,908
 No, say I had to make a fart!
I'd have to go to my private room just to make a fart!

557
01:12:46,033 --> 01:12:52,915
 Yeah, you probably would..!
Ok, things a guy does!

558
01:12:54,041 --> 01:12:56,919
 - Ok, next?
- She threw a shoe in me once..!

559
01:12:57,002 --> 01:13:01,924
 That's bad, that's very bad...!
Shoe-throwing things.

560
01:13:04,009 --> 01:13:07,930
 - How many is that?
- It's tied up, 3 and 3.

561
01:13:09,014 --> 01:13:16,939
 - Ok... Let's face it: she is probably the exact opposite
type of girl I'd normally met, you know!

562
01:13:17,022 --> 01:13:22,903
 She's got weird job, she dresses funny, she can't even put on make-up!

563
01:13:23,904 --> 01:13:27,908
 - Opposite types.
- That's us!...

564
01:13:30,911 --> 01:13:36,917
 - Here it is, pal! Three reasons for, four reasons against!..

565
01:13:36,917 --> 01:13:40,921
 - ... - Numbers don't lie!

566
01:13:40,921 --> 01:13:46,927
 - And hey, just because I don't move in
doesn't mean I can't still see her, right?

567
01:13:46,927 --> 01:13:52,933
 - I don't know, man...
- I mean... I DO like a girl...

568
01:13:53,016 --> 01:14:01,900
 Sometimes when I'm sitting around... she keeps
grabing my ear really soft... I like that.

569
01:14:06,029 --> 01:14:10,909
 - That's not a reason for, man!
- I don't know man, I mean the way you described it...

570
01:14:11,034 --> 01:14:13,912
 makes me wanna meet a girl like that.

571
01:14:14,037 --> 01:14:18,917
 - Tied up again, Johnny...
- I know!...I gotta think!...

572
01:14:21,003 --> 01:14:26,925
 Ok. See that, color TV, never watch it!

573
01:14:26,925 --> 01:14:29,928
 - Are you sure?
- Absolutely.

574
01:14:29,928 --> 01:14:33,932
 Now I just gotta find a way to break it to her...

575
01:14:47,905 --> 01:14:50,908
 - What is it you're thinking about?

576
01:14:52,910 --> 01:14:56,914
 - Well I guess I was thinking about a few things...

577
01:14:59,041 --> 01:15:03,921
 What I wanna say, is...

578
01:15:51,927 --> 01:15:59,935
 <shouting>

579
01:16:05,023 --> 01:16:08,902
 - He better give up
calling me "Pain"..! <?>

580
01:16:09,027 --> 01:16:15,909
 - I don't know maybe thought you'd paint a place... -...

581
01:16:17,035 --> 01:16:21,915
 - If you don't like it why just you don't go home?

582
01:16:28,922 --> 01:16:34,803
 - Can I help you with something?
- Yes, sir, you can get out of way so I may open the door.

583
01:16:34,928 --> 01:16:39,933
 - I prefer that you don't use this bathroom...
- Ok, which one should I use?

584
01:16:39,933 --> 01:16:44,938
 - Well, if I'm not mistaken, there's a close little gas station around...

585
01:16:44,938 --> 01:16:48,901
 - Fine, thanks...
- You'll find a rear door.

586
01:16:55,908 --> 01:16:58,911
 - The scum doesn't want me to use his bathroom...

587
01:16:58,911 --> 01:17:01,914
 - Relax, piss in the bucket.

588
01:17:01,914 --> 01:17:05,918
 - Where?
- In the closet.

589
01:17:23,018 --> 01:17:27,940
 - Deke! ... a gun!
- ...?

590
01:17:30,025 --> 01:17:32,903
 - Where did you get that?

591
01:17:44,039 --> 01:17:45,916
 - What are you doing?
- Shit.

592
01:17:46,041 --> 01:17:47,918
 - What?!

593
01:17:48,001 --> 01:17:50,921
 - Just talking!
- That's nice.

594
01:17:54,007 --> 01:17:55,926
 - I can't believe it!
- What!?

595
01:17:56,009 --> 01:17:59,930
 - This wall is covered with nips.
- What are nips?

596
01:18:00,013 --> 01:18:06,937
 - This little item is a nip.
...

597
01:18:07,020 --> 01:18:12,901
 ...my walls. Here's one... and here's another...

598
01:18:13,026 --> 01:18:19,032
 - We haven't paint it yet, man!
- You're gonna to still this down and repeat for entire...

599
01:18:19,032 --> 01:18:22,035
 - the thing I detest is little nipes on the wall...

600
01:18:25,038 --> 01:18:26,915
 - Sucker!

601
01:18:29,001 --> 01:18:31,920
 - What did you say?
- He said "Mark those nips!"

602
01:18:32,004 --> 01:18:36,925
 - He did not! He said "Suck my dick!"
- No, no, he said "Mark those nips!", that way we

603
01:18:37,009 --> 01:18:42,931
 - ...can start painting right away, sir!... - ...

604
01:18:48,020 --> 01:18:56,904
 - Come on man, it was just a joke! - Tomorrow, man, just,
just don't even look at the guy, man, just...

605
01:18:57,029 --> 01:18:59,907
 paint a wall so we get the hell out of there!

606
01:19:00,032 --> 01:19:01,909
 Alright.

607
01:19:04,036 --> 01:19:05,913
 Health.

608
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:13,921
 - Today is my birthday. - Happy birthday...

609
01:19:14,004 --> 01:19:17,925
 - Come on...- Look, I might ask Boccelli now... <?>

610
01:19:19,009 --> 01:19:21,929
 - I joined a band.

611
01:19:22,012 --> 01:19:26,934
 - When?
- Last week. I got tired wailing around, man.

612
01:19:30,020 --> 01:19:33,941
 - You pissed off?
- No... no!

613
01:19:36,026 --> 01:19:41,907
 - Why should I be pissed off?
- When are we gonna start one together, you know..?

614
01:19:42,032 --> 01:19:51,917
 - Forget it. Hey man, you got $5 I can borrow? I got to
pick some things up on my way home...

615
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:56,922
 - Guess you're doing a shopping now..?
- That's... really funny, man...

616
01:19:57,005 --> 01:19:58,924
 - Why!?

617
01:19:59,007 --> 01:20:02,928
 - You know what? I'll tell you something,
I'm getting sick of you...

618
01:20:03,011 --> 01:20:07,933
 - Look man, I'm just trying to make some conversation.
You don't like it? Go talk to someone else...

619
01:20:09,017 --> 01:20:11,937
 - You have a beer,
that's 2 dollars, pal!

620
01:20:12,020 --> 01:20:14,940
 - I can't believe it, man!

621
01:20:15,023 --> 01:20:19,820
 - It's my fucking birthday! And some guy who's
supposed to be my best friend can't buy me a fucking beer!

622
01:22:27,906 --> 01:22:35,914
 ...really gonna sound silly and I hope you don't
take this wrong way but I saw you in a train...

623
01:22:35,914 --> 01:22:43,922
 ...and I just wanna tell you you have the most
beautiful legs I've ever seen.

624
01:23:08,030 --> 01:23:11,909
 - Thanks for everything, I had a lovely time!

625
01:23:12,034 --> 01:23:14,912
 - Wait a second..! - What?

626
01:23:33,931 --> 01:23:38,936
 <cursing>

627
01:23:39,937 --> 01:23:41,939
 - Yvonne!
- Honey! <?>

628
01:23:41,939 --> 01:23:43,941
 - Glad I see you!
- Where have you been?

629
01:23:43,941 --> 01:23:46,902
 - You're not gonna believe this!
- What? Are you alright?

630
01:23:46,902 --> 01:23:50,906
 Yeah, I'm ok, but just fored a guy in a train...back guy got shot!...

631
01:23:51,031 --> 01:23:52,491
 - Oh god, oh my God! Was he killed?

632
01:23:52,533 --> 01:23:57,955
 - No, but he was hurt pretty bad!
Of course cops kept everybody down there asking...

633
01:23:58,205 --> 01:24:02,084
 - the same questions, over and over again!
- Well, why didn't you call me?!

634
01:24:02,125 --> 01:24:07,089
 - I tried! I said "Cops, I gotta use a phone!"
they even wouldn't let me make a call, can you believe it...

635
01:24:07,172 --> 01:24:10,926
 - Fucking asshole!
- I know! I ran all the way home...

636
01:24:11,009 --> 01:24:15,305
 - as I knew you'd be worried! 
- Oh, you must be starved. I'm glad you're ok...

637
01:24:15,389 --> 01:24:19,309
 - ...I've got a dinner in the fridge..
- yeah, I need to take a shower!..

638
01:24:19,393 --> 01:24:24,815
 - All right.
- You bought me a cake?

639
01:24:24,940 --> 01:24:28,902
 - No baby, I made it!
- You made me a cake?

640
01:24:31,905 --> 01:24:35,909
 - Are you sure you're ok?
- Yeah, I'm ok.

641
01:24:35,909 --> 01:24:38,912
 <It's just horrible to see a man going down...?>

642
01:24:41,915 --> 01:24:45,919
 - Look at all the presents! What is this, Christmas?

643
01:24:47,921 --> 01:24:49,923
 - Open it!

644
01:24:51,925 --> 01:24:57,931
 - Yeah? No, I'm gonna wait til we have our cake.
I can't believe that you made this for me! It's perfect!

645
01:25:02,019 --> 01:25:08,025
 - What have you  done?
- Me? Nothing! Deke must have put those there...

646
01:25:08,108 --> 01:25:09,902
 ...as some kind of birthday joke!...
. I tell you that guy...

647
01:25:10,027 --> 01:25:13,489
 - ...has got sick sense of humour...
- Stop it, Johnny. I could smell it all over you...

648
01:25:13,572 --> 01:25:16,909
 - since you've been walking thru' door! - I don't know
what you smell, but I smell a guy's been working all day!

649
01:25:17,034 --> 01:25:24,833
 - You fucked somebody, ok?! I cut your shit!

650
01:25:24,917 --> 01:25:30,923
 Why!? Why?! You just tell me why you did it!

651
01:25:33,926 --> 01:25:37,930
 - Only thing I can say is I know you're gonna think this is stupid.

652
01:25:38,931 --> 01:25:40,933
 But...

653
01:25:44,937 --> 01:25:53,904
 It felt like something was behind me all day, you know, pushing me and shoving...
Do you know what I mean?

654
01:25:54,905 --> 01:25:56,907
 - No.

655
01:25:57,908 --> 01:26:04,915
 - Like a giant hand...
pushing me from behind and I couldn't stop it.

656
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:16,927
 And I started following this girl, nothing special
about her, really, but every time I tried to stop...

657
01:26:17,010 --> 01:26:25,811
 the giant hand gave me another shov. And...
somehow I ended up in her kitchen and we did it...

658
01:26:25,936 --> 01:26:32,818
 - So, she cooked you dinner?
- Yeah, see what I mean? The whole thing is like a dream...

659
01:26:32,901 --> 01:26:40,826
 ...and than we were in bed... But it's not like
I enjoyed it or anything!

660
01:26:40,909 --> 01:26:47,833
 But for the first time in my life,
I felt like I was home..!

661
01:26:48,917 --> 01:26:54,923
 - Well, Johnny, that's the biggest pile
of shit I ever heard in my life!

662
01:26:55,924 --> 01:26:59,928
 - I tried to explain how I feel
and you don't even try to understand!

663
01:26:59,928 --> 01:27:05,934
 - Oh, no, I understand! You saw a girl, you fucked her,
she made you feel at home...

664
01:27:05,934 --> 01:27:09,938
 - and than you lie to me about the whole fucking... - When I said she made me...

665
01:27:09,938 --> 01:27:12,941
 - ...feel at home, I said, it felt like I was home! - Get out!

666
01:27:13,025 --> 01:27:16,904
 - What?
- I can't even look at your fucking face, get out!

667
01:27:17,029 --> 01:27:20,908
 - I'm out of here, man. You think I need this shit? No!

668
01:27:21,033 --> 01:27:24,912
 - I am my own man!
- You are a lying piece of shit!

669
01:27:25,037 --> 01:27:31,919
 - You know what I am?! I'm stupid for ever letting you
talk me into moving into this scope in the first place!
 I got places...

670
01:27:32,002 --> 01:27:36,924
 I wanna go, I got things I gotta do!.. You think
I want to be stacked here with a chick...

671
01:27:37,007 --> 01:27:40,928
 ...who can't even put a fucking make-up?! No!

672
01:27:53,023 --> 01:27:57,903
 - Did I tell you about throwing shoes?! Did I?!

673
01:28:58,005 --> 01:28:59,923
 - Hey...

674
01:29:01,008 --> 01:29:02,926
 - Hi...

675
01:29:05,012 --> 01:29:09,933
 - I've been looking all over for you.
Deke saw you from across the street.

676
01:29:10,017 --> 01:29:14,938
 Have been asking everybody if he's seen a guy
who wears a suede shoe that looks like this...

677
01:29:15,022 --> 01:29:19,902
 - Where did you find it?
- On the roof of the car.

678
01:29:20,027 --> 01:29:25,908
 - I looked all over 20 minutes for this thing!
I can't believe you found it!

679
01:29:30,037 --> 01:29:34,917
 - What happened to you?
- I don't know.

680
01:29:37,002 --> 01:29:40,923
 - I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
- Alright.

681
01:29:49,014 --> 01:29:50,933
 - No...
- Calm.

682
01:31:39,041 --> 01:31:41,919
 - Yvonne, sorry...

683
01:31:44,004 --> 01:31:47,925
 And so our story ends.
Did she forgive him?

684
01:31:48,008 --> 01:31:51,929
 Did they stay together?
No-one knows.

685
01:31:52,012 --> 01:31:55,933
 And the one thing
he was looking for...

686
01:31:57,017 --> 01:31:59,937
 Some people say
he found it.

687
01:32:00,020 --> 01:32:03,941
 Other people say it ended up
on side of the road...

688
01:32:04,024 --> 01:32:07,903
 somewhere just outside
of Delaware.
