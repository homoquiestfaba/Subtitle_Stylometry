(beeping)

4
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:56,056
- [Man On Message] Hello, Josh.

5
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:57,223
Josh, are you there?

6
00:00:57,223 --> 00:01:00,101
It's your father, pick
up the goddamn phone.

7
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:00,977
Your mother just showed me

8
00:01:00,977 --> 00:01:03,605
last week's Backpage Josh,
and I can't believe it.

9
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:04,731
Three weeks after your acquittal

10
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:06,524
and you placed another goddamn ad.

11
00:01:06,524 --> 00:01:08,026
Are you outta your fuckin' mind?

12
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:11,071
Well, this time I swear,
I'll cut you off completely.

13
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:13,990
Hear me? Completely, not another dime.

14
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:15,367
You'll be out in the goddamn streets

15
00:01:15,367 --> 00:01:16,618
and the next time you're arrested,

16
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:18,411
you're gonna rot with the other trash.

17
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:20,413
So don't expect your
mother to save you either.

18
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:21,331
I won't let her.

19
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:22,415
We've had it, Josh.

20
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:24,334
You've brought too much
shame to this family,

21
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:25,585
but now it's gonna stop.

22
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:30,173

23
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:32,008

fine for me after all.

00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:43,561
Okay, I'll see you then.

29
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:45,855

30
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:49,192

00:02:13,717 --> 00:02:16,344

Let her do it.

133
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:40,937
- Jennifer.

(lyrics muffled)

135
00:08:58,246 --> 00:09:00,081
- Hey, you okay?

136
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:00,957
Do you need anything?

137
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:03,126
A beer, something stronger maybe.

138
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:05,003
- A glass of wine would be great.

139
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:06,004
- No problem.

140
00:09:06,004 --> 00:09:07,505
- Do you wanna see a doctor? Did they?

141
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:08,673
- No.

142
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:11,009
Pretty lucky you guys
got there when you did.

143
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:14,637
Jesus Christ, those guys are really dead.

144
00:09:16,848 --> 00:09:18,099
- At least you're alive.

145
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:20,643
- You know, it's no wonder
those scumbag picked you up.

146
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:22,479
You gotta sucker written all over you.

147
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:23,355
- What do you mean?

148
00:09:23,355 --> 00:09:24,731
- Your clothes? Look at 'em.

149
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:27,650
- [Woman] Yeah, they all dress
that way where you're from?

150
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:28,902
- Yeah, pretty much.

151
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:30,320
- Where you from, anyway?

152
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,156
- Ohio, Steubenville.

153
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:34,366
- Stupidville.

154
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:38,787
- Steubenville.

155
00:09:38,787 --> 00:09:40,914
- I'm sorry, it just sounded like that.

156
00:09:42,165 --> 00:09:44,417
- So what brings you
to New York, Jennifer?

157
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:45,794
Any friends or family here?

158
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:50,632
- You married?

159
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:54,636
(sinister music)

160
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:00,100
- It's a simple question, Jennifer.

161
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,103
- No, not anymore.

162
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:04,562
Not after last night, anyway.

163
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:05,980
- What happened last night?

164
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,692
- Leave her alone, Priss.

165
00:10:08,692 --> 00:10:09,901
- We just saved her ass.

166
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:12,821
The least she can do is
answer a few simple questions.

167
00:10:12,821 --> 00:10:15,532
- I walked out, I
couldn't take it anymore.

168
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:17,575
Look, do we have to talk
about this right now?

169
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:19,494
- Yeah, why not? It's interesting.

170
00:10:19,494 --> 00:10:21,830
- Leave her alone, Priss.

171
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:24,082
- I left my husband, he was crazy.

172
00:10:24,082 --> 00:10:26,084
He was trying to kill me.

173
00:10:26,084 --> 00:10:28,003
- So you just packed up and left?

174
00:10:28,003 --> 00:10:29,337
- Yeah, like I said.

175
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:31,131
- Fuck him, serves him right.

176
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:32,424
- Good for you, Jennifer.

177
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,597
- [Woman] Look, where are you gonna stay?

178
00:10:42,017 --> 00:10:43,184
- I dunno.

179
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:46,396
I'm sure I can find a cheap
hotel, if it's clean at least.

180
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:49,399
- [Woman] Clean and
cheap? Not in this town.

181
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:51,109
- Hey, how about staying with us?

182
00:10:51,109 --> 00:10:53,194
I have a sofa bed at my place.

183
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:54,529
You can crash with me.

184
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:55,739
- I don't wanna be any trouble.

185
00:10:55,739 --> 00:10:56,781
- No trouble.

186
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:58,908
Let me fix you up with some clothes.

187
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:01,703
We'll get rid of that Betty
Crocker poster child look.

188
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:02,579
- [Woman] You know, if you want

189
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:03,872
some extra cash or something,

190
00:11:03,872 --> 00:11:06,458
you could probably pick a few tips here.

191
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:08,793
- I don't think I could take
my clothes off for strangers.

192
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:10,628
- [Woman] You only have to
do that if you dance silly.

193
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:13,423
- She'll be fine as long as she's smart,

194
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:14,966
and keeps her mouth shut.

195
00:11:16,968 --> 00:11:18,511
You understand, don't you Jen?

196
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:21,890
- Yeah, I think so.

197
00:11:28,563 --> 00:11:32,817
(muffled voices on police radio)

198
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,571
- Well, look what the cat dragged in.

199
00:11:36,571 --> 00:11:38,365
- Good morning, Detectives (indistinct).

200
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:39,783
- Hey Perez.
- Cahill.

201
00:11:39,783 --> 00:11:42,285
- God, what'd they do to this bastard?

202
00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:44,287
- That's Gilby, the rapist.

203
00:11:44,287 --> 00:11:46,164
- Yeah, that's Josh Gilby.

204
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:48,792
- Just thought we'd drop
in on you and the rookie.

205
00:11:48,792 --> 00:11:50,543
- Hey look, enough with that shit, okay?

206
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:51,920
It's been over three months.

207
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,254
- Over three months.

208
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:55,340
Can't teach him another damn thing, huh?

209
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:57,842
- You know, fuck you Cahill.

210
00:11:57,842 --> 00:11:59,803
This is probably one of your friends.

211
00:12:02,931 --> 00:12:05,100
(muffled police radio)

212
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,935
- Christ, I don't believe this shit.

213
00:12:06,935 --> 00:12:08,061
Three in one day.

214
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:09,229
- Three?

215
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:11,022
- Castrations.

216
00:12:11,022 --> 00:12:12,565
First thing this morning, we get a call

217
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:15,360
about a couple of stiffs
over by the Port Authority.

218
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,321
Two young punks, beaten
to a pulp and shot.

219
00:12:18,321 --> 00:12:19,989
One of them had his balls shot off.

220
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:22,033
The other one had 'em
cut off with a knife.

221
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:22,909
- What'd you find?

222
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:24,703
- A woman's wallet with
the stiff's fingerprints

223
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:25,829
all over 'em.

224
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:28,123
They must have mugged her
before they got whacked.

225
00:12:28,123 --> 00:12:29,541
- Was there anything on the woman?

226
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:32,085
- Ohio driver's license, mid-20's.

227
00:12:37,632 --> 00:12:38,508
- But what about the stiffs?

228
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:39,384
Did you run their sheets?

229
00:12:39,384 --> 00:12:41,428
- We ID-ed one so far.

230
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:42,554
- Any rapes?

231
00:12:42,554 --> 00:12:45,098
- A couple. Why?

232
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:46,683
Don't tell me you think
there's some connection

233
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:47,559
with this guy?

234
00:12:48,852 --> 00:12:50,103
Come on, Billie.

235
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:52,105
We're talking about a
couple of street punks

236
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:53,606
that got in over their head.

237
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,275
They crashed the wrong party.

238
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:57,360
The next thing you know, boom.

239
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,695
- What about Josh Gilby?

240
00:12:58,695 --> 00:12:59,738
- What about him?

241
00:12:59,738 --> 00:13:02,365
- Look Tony, he beat
up and raped 11 women.

242
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:05,118
That's 11 that we know for
sure, and what happened to him?

243
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:06,578
- Just bullshit psych counseling,

244
00:13:06,578 --> 00:13:08,038
thanks to daddy's millions.

245
00:13:08,038 --> 00:13:10,540
- I'm familiar with the fuckin' case.

246
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:11,499
- Who ain't?

247
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:12,792
I mean, it was on the front of the Post

248
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,169
for about five straight weeks.

249
00:13:14,169 --> 00:13:15,128
- You can read?

250
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:18,173
- Grady, show him the Polaroids.

251
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:22,052
Now here's the evidence

252
00:13:22,052 --> 00:13:24,554
that should have convicted
that son of a bitch.

253
00:13:24,554 --> 00:13:26,681
- These were scattered all over
the floor when we found him.

254
00:13:26,681 --> 00:13:29,100
- So these are the missing photos.

255
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,894
- These are pretty wild.

256
00:13:30,894 --> 00:13:33,730
Tony, what do you think hard
copy would pay for these?

257
00:13:37,025 --> 00:13:39,778
- So you think it's a vigilante killing?

258
00:13:39,778 --> 00:13:40,945
- Yes I do.

259
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:42,906
- I think you're pressin' it, Perez.

260
00:13:42,906 --> 00:13:44,949
- I think all the years
you worked in sex crimes

261
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:46,659
has left you a tad biased, okay?

262
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:48,328
- I'm not crying over Josh Gilby.

263
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:50,372
- Yeah, well let's just
remember one thing.

264
00:13:50,372 --> 00:13:53,208
Nobody forced those women up
there, they went willingly.

265
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:55,293
- You are such an asshole, Cahill.

266
00:13:55,293 --> 00:13:56,628
- An asshole.

267
00:13:56,628 --> 00:14:00,006
- Relax Billie, Cahill's just nervous.

268
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:01,633
- What are you talking about?

269
00:14:01,633 --> 00:14:03,385
- Well, they're whacking rapists, right?

270
00:14:03,385 --> 00:14:04,678
- Yeah, so?

271
00:14:04,678 --> 00:14:06,429
- So, if they find out about you

272
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:07,472
and that 12-year-old hooker,

273
00:14:07,472 --> 00:14:09,265
you gonna wind up on the list.

274
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:10,684
- And I'm gonna take
your fuckin' head off.

275
00:14:10,684 --> 00:14:11,559
- How's that pal?

276
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:12,852
Come on, Cahill.
- You little-

277
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:13,937
- Come on, here I am.

278
00:14:13,937 --> 00:14:15,146
- You laugh, you little prick.

279
00:14:15,146 --> 00:14:16,564
You think you're hot shit up there

280
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:18,400
in homicide with the big boys, huh?

281
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,651
You better watch you don't wind up

282
00:14:19,651 --> 00:14:21,319
like her last partner, pal.

283
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:22,153
- Hey, what the fuck?

284
00:14:22,153 --> 00:14:24,030
You know IA ruled in my favor.

285
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,699
- Come on, tell him about Charlie Moran.

286
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:26,991
Boy's got the right to know.

287
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:28,743
- Al, get the fuck out of here.

288
00:14:28,743 --> 00:14:30,328
You watch your back, wise guy.

289
00:14:30,328 --> 00:14:32,497
You'll get your ass killed too, all right.

290
00:14:32,497 --> 00:14:34,332
- Tony, get him off my crime scene.

291
00:14:39,337 --> 00:14:41,339
- Chill out, I can take care of myself.

292
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:42,507
- Yeah, let's hope so.

293
00:14:45,969 --> 00:14:47,095
- Sorry, Trish.

294
00:14:47,095 --> 00:14:49,514
I'm really grateful to you
for all you've done for me,

295
00:14:49,514 --> 00:14:50,974
but I just don't belong.

296
00:14:58,148 --> 00:14:59,649
- I know it's been rough Jen.

297
00:15:01,735 --> 00:15:03,111
Give us a chance.

298
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:06,990
I know you've got more in common with us

299
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:08,241
than you want to admit.

300
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:09,868
- Maybe, but I still don't fit in

301
00:15:09,868 --> 00:15:10,827
with your crazy little gang.

302
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:15,749
- We just wanna see justice
done, set things straight.

303
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:17,751
- I don't care about any of that crap.

304
00:15:17,751 --> 00:15:20,128
All I wanna do is live a normal life.

305
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:22,422
- And where are you gonna live it?

306
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:24,966
Back in Ohio, or wherever
it is you're from?

307
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:29,054
I know you haven't told me everything.

308
00:15:29,054 --> 00:15:30,847
You really can't go back, can you?

309
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,601
- I'm probably safer on my own, Trish.

310
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:38,897
- They won't just let you go.

311
00:15:38,897 --> 00:15:40,523
- What do you mean?

312
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:42,067
- You could burn us.

313
00:15:42,067 --> 00:15:43,485
- I'd never say anything.

314
00:15:43,485 --> 00:15:46,279
Christ, I'm the one that killed
that guy that attacked me.

315
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:47,489
Jesse made sure of that.

316
00:15:47,489 --> 00:15:49,741
She made sure that I was the
one that pulled the trigger.

317
00:15:49,741 --> 00:15:51,159
- They won't take the risk.

318
00:15:52,535 --> 00:15:54,079
- What would they do, kill me?

319
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:59,084
Jesus Christ, I don't believe this shit.

320
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:01,336
- I'm sorry.

321
00:16:03,713 --> 00:16:05,840
You can stay with me as long as you want.

322
00:16:13,682 --> 00:16:15,975
- Let's go Jen, you gotta get up.

323
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,018
- What are you doing?

324
00:16:19,771 --> 00:16:21,815
Oh God, what time is it?

325
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:39,624
- Okay, all clear.

326
00:16:43,628 --> 00:16:46,256
(gun firing)

327
00:16:54,222 --> 00:16:55,724
Hey Jen, get over here.

328
00:16:55,724 --> 00:16:57,017
We got something for you.

329
00:16:59,978 --> 00:17:01,354
Come on Jen, hurry up.

330
00:17:04,232 --> 00:17:06,151
- Man, we don't have all
day, now get over here.

331
00:17:06,151 --> 00:17:07,027
- Okay, what?

332
00:17:07,986 --> 00:17:08,862
- Take it.

333
00:17:09,988 --> 00:17:11,448
- Oh, I don't.

334
00:17:11,448 --> 00:17:12,323
- It's years, yeah.

335
00:17:12,323 --> 00:17:13,450
- See how it feels.

336
00:17:15,243 --> 00:17:16,369
- Go ahead, feel it.

337
00:17:17,454 --> 00:17:18,621
- Feel what?

338
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:19,873
- The power man.

339
00:17:19,873 --> 00:17:23,001
Go ahead, feel it, and aim
over there at the target.

340
00:17:23,001 --> 00:17:23,960
- The target.

341
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,671
I really don't like guns.

342
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:29,132
- Look, Jen you got a
lot of catching up to do.

343
00:17:29,132 --> 00:17:31,301
Becky's gonna run you through the basics.

344
00:17:32,302 --> 00:17:35,638
You know Jen, if you're not
with us 100% you're a liability.

345
00:17:37,974 --> 00:17:39,100
So go ahead, Becky.

346
00:17:40,268 --> 00:17:42,729
- Just listen to everything I say, okay.

347
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:43,605
- Yeah.

348
00:17:43,605 --> 00:17:45,982
- Remember, a gun is a powerful weapon,

349
00:17:45,982 --> 00:17:48,068
but you have control over it.

350
00:17:49,277 --> 00:17:50,487
- Okay.
- Okay?

351
00:17:51,446 --> 00:17:53,490
Now line up your front sight

352
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:55,533
with the slot of your rear sight.

353
00:17:55,533 --> 00:17:56,368
- Okay.

354
00:17:56,368 --> 00:17:58,328
- Aim it at the target
where you wanna shoot.

355
00:17:59,662 --> 00:18:00,580
- Okay?

356
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:03,416
- Okay, now kick your legs
apart, steady yourself.

357
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:06,544
Straighten your back, extend your arms.

358
00:18:06,544 --> 00:18:07,754
- Okay.
- All right.

359
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:09,214
Line up both your sites.

360
00:18:09,214 --> 00:18:11,716
- Got it.
- Aim at the target.

361
00:18:11,716 --> 00:18:13,385
Okay, take a deep breath in,

362
00:18:14,552 --> 00:18:17,055
breathe out slowly and
squeeze the trigger.

363
00:18:19,474 --> 00:18:21,101
Squeeze the trigger.

364
00:18:21,101 --> 00:18:24,479
(gun firing)

365
00:18:24,479 --> 00:18:26,272
- [Jen] Did I hit it?

366
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:28,608
(laughing)

367
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:35,323
(gun firing)

368
00:18:35,323 --> 00:18:37,200
- That's how you fuckin' do it.

369
00:18:38,118 --> 00:18:40,203
- [Woman] So Priss is a show off now, huh?

370
00:18:46,209 --> 00:18:51,339
- There was this one time I
was cooking with tomato sauce,

371
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:54,217
and he came over to check on it,

372
00:18:54,217 --> 00:18:57,303
and he thought I made it too spicy.

373
00:18:58,221 --> 00:19:01,850
So he hit me and he hit me in
such a way that I hit the pot,

374
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:05,186
and the pot went and it splattered
all over the front of me,

375
00:19:05,186 --> 00:19:07,022
and I could feel it like burning my legs

376
00:19:07,022 --> 00:19:08,481
and I started screaming

377
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:11,484
and I was like brushing my pants off.

378
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:14,612
And so he made me take off all my clothes

379
00:19:14,612 --> 00:19:17,323
and crawl on the floor
and wipe everything up.

380
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:18,950
- [Woman] That's pretty fucked up.

381
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:22,370
- So why did you stay with him so long?

382
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:23,538
You didn't answer that.

383
00:19:26,124 --> 00:19:28,251
- 'Cause I didn't have anyone else.

384
00:19:29,753 --> 00:19:30,628
- Actually, that's the first thing

385
00:19:30,628 --> 00:19:32,130
that ever came outta your
mouth that I believe,

386
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:34,382
'cause I understand that.

387
00:19:34,382 --> 00:19:37,135
One of my first boyfriends was like that.

388
00:19:37,135 --> 00:19:37,969
He was like,

389
00:19:37,969 --> 00:19:39,429
he got me into all sorts of shit,

390
00:19:39,429 --> 00:19:40,764
and I just like sort
of went along with it,

391
00:19:40,764 --> 00:19:43,433
and I actually thought
that he was helping me out,

392
00:19:43,433 --> 00:19:44,976
even though I was getting
more and more fucked up,

393
00:19:44,976 --> 00:19:47,020
you know, I thought.

394
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,772
- Well, there's nothing
wrong with men, okay?

395
00:19:48,772 --> 00:19:51,441
It's just the things that some
people do are unforgivable,

396
00:19:51,441 --> 00:19:53,151
but men in general.

397
00:19:53,151 --> 00:19:55,153
- Well, you know what's funny
is that it's usually men

398
00:19:55,153 --> 00:19:56,905
who do those unforgivable things,

399
00:19:56,905 --> 00:19:58,948
and I have never met one who isn't capable

400
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:00,367
or hasn't done some shit.

401
00:20:00,367 --> 00:20:01,576
They all do some shit.

402
00:20:01,576 --> 00:20:03,328
(cross-talking)

403
00:20:03,328 --> 00:20:04,537
If they can get away
with it, they'll do it.

404
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:05,997
- You know, we're out here in the woods,

405
00:20:05,997 --> 00:20:07,707
and we end up talking
about men again, man,

406
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:09,626
I get so sick.

407
00:20:09,626 --> 00:20:12,295
- Why, why does his opinion matter?

408
00:20:12,295 --> 00:20:14,422
As far as like dancing is beautiful.

409
00:20:14,422 --> 00:20:16,216
- I've got nothing against you dancing,

410
00:20:16,216 --> 00:20:17,884
but I just don't understand it.

411
00:20:17,884 --> 00:20:18,760
I can't do it.
- What do you mean

412
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,136
you don't understand?

413
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:21,012
(laughing)

414
00:20:21,012 --> 00:20:23,807
You're like showing these
guys bodies and everything

415
00:20:23,807 --> 00:20:25,183
and they're thinking

416
00:20:25,183 --> 00:20:26,935
that they're gonna get sex or something.

417
00:20:26,935 --> 00:20:28,436
I don't understand, I mean.

418
00:20:28,436 --> 00:20:30,647
- Hey just 'cause I have a good
body and I like to show it,

419
00:20:30,647 --> 00:20:32,607
that doesn't mean someone
can just hop on me

420
00:20:32,607 --> 00:20:33,525
whenever they want to.

421
00:20:33,525 --> 00:20:36,528
- The thing is, you know, we're
making a living for ourself

422
00:20:36,528 --> 00:20:39,322
and not depending on
anybody else do it for us.

423
00:20:39,322 --> 00:20:40,990
- Hell, I used to a prostitute.

424
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:42,492
I know many other skills.

425
00:20:43,451 --> 00:20:46,955
- God, if he ever saw me
do something like that,

426
00:20:46,955 --> 00:20:48,039
if he knew that I,

427
00:20:48,039 --> 00:20:50,500
if I was like a waitress
in a place like that.

428
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,377
- I think you guys are missing the point.

429
00:20:52,377 --> 00:20:54,921
The point is that the
job is not the dance.

430
00:20:54,921 --> 00:20:56,089
The dance is the front.

431
00:20:56,089 --> 00:20:59,217
The job is the justice, so
the dance doesn't even matter.

432
00:21:00,719 --> 00:21:02,512
- What's so bad about a go-go bar?

433
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:08,184
(rock music)

434
00:21:29,414 --> 00:21:32,834
(lyrics muffled)

435
00:21:32,834 --> 00:21:35,128
- Hey, how about some service?

436
00:21:35,128 --> 00:21:36,004
- Yeah, yeah.

437
00:21:36,004 --> 00:21:38,006
Any one of you sweet things
wanna bring me and my brother

438
00:21:38,006 --> 00:21:38,882
a brewski please?

439
00:21:42,385 --> 00:21:43,970
- So what do you guys want?

440
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:47,098
- Make it two shots of
Cuervo and two Dos Equis.

441
00:21:47,098 --> 00:21:50,393
- No Dos Equis, just Bud,
Heineken, and Miller.

442
00:21:52,187 --> 00:21:54,898
- All right, give me two
Heinekens and the shots.

443
00:21:54,898 --> 00:21:57,859
Make sure it's Cuervo too,
'cause I can tell the difference.

444
00:21:57,859 --> 00:21:58,777
What (indistinct)?

445
00:22:05,408 --> 00:22:06,284
- Yes.

446
00:22:15,627 --> 00:22:16,961
- Just keep it.

447
00:22:17,879 --> 00:22:21,007
- Hey hey hey, why don't
you pull up a chair,

448
00:22:21,007 --> 00:22:21,883
have a drink with us?

449
00:22:21,883 --> 00:22:23,468
What do you say?

450
00:22:23,468 --> 00:22:24,636
- Yeah baby.

451
00:22:24,636 --> 00:22:25,512
Right here.

452
00:22:30,183 --> 00:22:31,184
- She got intimidated by it.

453
00:22:31,184 --> 00:22:33,770
She saw us on TV, got nervous, right?

454
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:43,488
- [Bartender] Last call, drink up.

455
00:22:43,488 --> 00:22:45,990
(rock music)

456
00:22:52,539 --> 00:22:55,417
(lyrics muffled)

457
00:22:58,128 --> 00:23:00,422
- Hey, sweetheart?

458
00:23:00,422 --> 00:23:03,216
That's kind of a big G-string
you're wearing there.

459
00:23:03,216 --> 00:23:05,301
You've got some kids, yeah?

460
00:23:05,301 --> 00:23:06,469
- What?

461
00:23:06,469 --> 00:23:08,430
- Well, usually a big G-string

462
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:10,724
means that you've had some babies.

463
00:23:10,724 --> 00:23:12,892
- Why, you think there's
something wrong with my body?

464
00:23:12,892 --> 00:23:13,768
- Oh no, no, no.

465
00:23:13,768 --> 00:23:18,023
I'm just wondering, C-sections
and scars and nasty shit.

466
00:23:19,357 --> 00:23:20,900
- No. Okay?

467
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:23,319
I haven't had a fucking C-section,

468
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:25,113
all right you fucking bastard.

469
00:23:25,113 --> 00:23:25,989
- Okay.

470
00:23:31,202 --> 00:23:34,456
- Yo, another round over here.

471
00:23:34,456 --> 00:23:37,751
- Sorry guys, we had last call, remember?

472
00:23:37,751 --> 00:23:39,419
- Go ahead, give 'em what they want.

473
00:23:47,844 --> 00:23:49,888
- You fuckin' bitch.

474
00:23:49,888 --> 00:23:52,015
- Keep your fucking hands off me.

475
00:23:52,015 --> 00:23:53,850
Hey, she only spilled it
'cause you grabbed her,

476
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:55,602
you fucking prick.

477
00:23:55,602 --> 00:23:56,895
- Take it easy, all right?

478
00:23:56,895 --> 00:23:59,272
- [Prick] Look at this fucking
coat, it costs me 500 bucks.

479
00:23:59,272 --> 00:24:00,148
- It's not so bad.

480
00:24:00,148 --> 00:24:02,192
Hey, be cool, all right?

481
00:24:02,192 --> 00:24:05,028
Listen, there's a lotta
pussy about this place, man.

482
00:24:05,028 --> 00:24:06,237
These guys have been checking out

483
00:24:06,237 --> 00:24:07,864
since we walked in, all right?

484
00:24:07,864 --> 00:24:10,408
Don't fuck it up by decking one of them.

485
00:24:10,408 --> 00:24:12,869
Please? All right, sit down.

486
00:24:17,457 --> 00:24:18,375
Excuse me?

487
00:24:19,542 --> 00:24:20,377
Everybody.

488
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:25,423
I would like to apologize
on behalf of my buddy here.

489
00:24:27,008 --> 00:24:28,426
We're sorry about the disturbance.

490
00:24:28,426 --> 00:24:31,304
We didn't mean to cause
any trouble, all right?

491
00:24:31,304 --> 00:24:33,932
We apologize, no hard feelings, okay?

492
00:24:33,932 --> 00:24:34,891
- Oh no sweat.

493
00:24:35,809 --> 00:24:38,269
Actually, the next two rounds are on us.

494
00:24:39,646 --> 00:24:40,855
- All right.

495
00:24:40,855 --> 00:24:41,731
Thank you.

496
00:24:46,236 --> 00:24:47,404
Did you hear that, man?

497
00:24:48,321 --> 00:24:49,698
I tell you this is a lock.

498
00:24:52,534 --> 00:24:55,120
(rock music)

499
00:25:03,253 --> 00:25:05,130
- Hey guys, can I ask you something?

500
00:25:06,589 --> 00:25:07,674
- Tell me what, baby.

501
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:10,802
- You know the girl
who spilled the drinks.

502
00:25:10,802 --> 00:25:13,221
- Stupid bitch, what about her?

503
00:25:13,221 --> 00:25:16,057
- Well, today's her birthday.

504
00:25:16,057 --> 00:25:17,183
- Oh.

505
00:25:17,183 --> 00:25:19,227
Working on her birthday,
knowing that she's pissed off.

506
00:25:19,227 --> 00:25:20,270
- Too bad.

507
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:21,771
- Yeah, you know?

508
00:25:21,771 --> 00:25:23,481
Oh, we were thinking about
having a party for her,

509
00:25:23,481 --> 00:25:25,483
you know, after we close,

510
00:25:25,483 --> 00:25:28,028
and I was thinking it'd
be a really great idea if

511
00:25:29,529 --> 00:25:34,617
maybe you guys hung out and
helped us celebrate, you know?

512
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:37,954
- Yeah, that's perfect actually,

513
00:25:37,954 --> 00:25:38,830
because my friend and I

514
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:40,582
are doing a little celebrating ourselves.

515
00:25:40,582 --> 00:25:42,959
We just signed on for two
more years on Dark of Night.

516
00:25:42,959 --> 00:25:43,835
Thank you.

517
00:25:43,835 --> 00:25:45,211
- Oh yeah?

518
00:25:45,211 --> 00:25:47,797
- It's one of the longest
running soaps in New York.

519
00:25:47,797 --> 00:25:50,258
- Hey wow, I can't wait to tell the girls.

520
00:25:50,258 --> 00:25:52,469
They're gonna be really
excited about this.

521
00:25:57,932 --> 00:25:59,017
- Be careful Jess.

522
00:25:59,017 --> 00:25:59,893
- Now, don't worry.

523
00:25:59,893 --> 00:26:01,019
Everything will be all right.

524
00:26:01,019 --> 00:26:02,896
- No, I mean it, Jess.

525
00:26:02,896 --> 00:26:05,190
You don't need any more
trouble from the cops.

526
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:06,900
- Look, go home, get some sleep.

527
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,860
I'll call you tomorrow, okay?

528
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:11,029
- Ah, Annie, don't leave.

529
00:26:11,029 --> 00:26:14,824
We're gonna have a party. (laughing)

530
00:26:24,918 --> 00:26:26,544
- What's wrong, boys?

531
00:26:26,544 --> 00:26:29,214
- Just waiting for the party to start.

532
00:26:29,214 --> 00:26:30,090
- [Woman] Let's go, start it, come on.

533
00:26:32,967 --> 00:26:35,261
- Well, what do you got in mind, huh?

534
00:26:35,261 --> 00:26:36,429
- Well you know, I was thinking
that we would do something

535
00:26:36,429 --> 00:26:38,807
just a little bit special,
a little different.

536
00:26:41,476 --> 00:26:42,560
- I have an idea.

537
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,979
One of you babes come up here with us.

538
00:26:44,979 --> 00:26:46,022
- Some of you come up
here and dance with me,

539
00:26:46,022 --> 00:26:47,357
the more the merrier, right?

540
00:26:47,357 --> 00:26:49,651
I'm gonna everything
in this building, dude.

541
00:26:51,069 --> 00:26:52,278
- You're really gonna love this, Jen.

542
00:26:52,278 --> 00:26:53,154
Go boys.

543
00:26:54,906 --> 00:26:58,326
- Hey, let me see some skin.

544
00:26:58,326 --> 00:27:01,121
(indistinct)

545
00:27:01,121 --> 00:27:02,831
- What the fuck?

546
00:27:02,831 --> 00:27:03,998
You see that bitch?

547
00:27:03,998 --> 00:27:06,459
- Go on you little fucks,
you're starting to bore me.

548
00:27:06,459 --> 00:27:07,877
- Take it off.

549
00:27:07,877 --> 00:27:10,672
That's right boys, all the way off.

550
00:27:12,215 --> 00:27:13,591
- I don't want to stay anymore, let's go.

551
00:27:13,591 --> 00:27:14,467
Come on.

552
00:27:14,467 --> 00:27:15,343
- What, you nuts man?

553
00:27:15,343 --> 00:27:16,553
This is beautiful.

554
00:27:16,553 --> 00:27:17,679
Look at them, they want to see your meat.

555
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:19,180
Show 'em your meat.

556
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:23,268
- Yeah I want to see you with
the cover off. (laughing)

557
00:27:23,268 --> 00:27:24,644
- Are you pricks deaf?

558
00:27:24,644 --> 00:27:27,856
We said to take off your
clothes, now take 'em off.

559
00:27:27,856 --> 00:27:29,983
We want to see if you're really big men.

560
00:27:29,983 --> 00:27:32,027
- I told you that's what they wanted, man.

561
00:27:32,027 --> 00:27:32,902
- Yeah.

562
00:27:34,779 --> 00:27:36,573
- Check it out, baby.

563
00:27:40,368 --> 00:27:41,244
What?

564
00:27:42,662 --> 00:27:43,496
What!

565
00:27:45,331 --> 00:27:47,208
Fuck me, this is fucking humiliating.

566
00:27:47,208 --> 00:27:49,210
Let's get the fuck out.

567
00:27:53,089 --> 00:27:55,550
- Get over against the wall.

568
00:27:57,635 --> 00:27:58,762
- What the fuck?

569
00:27:58,762 --> 00:27:59,637
What the fuck?

570
00:27:59,637 --> 00:28:00,638
- I don't care you fucker.

571
00:28:00,638 --> 00:28:02,390
(indistinct) huh?

572
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:03,641
What are you gonna do now?

573
00:28:03,641 --> 00:28:06,770
You gonna talk about G-strings now?

574
00:28:08,021 --> 00:28:11,649
- Didn't anybody ever tell
you not to hit a lady?

575
00:28:12,692 --> 00:28:13,568
- Fuck!

576
00:28:13,568 --> 00:28:16,696
(muffled speaking)

577
00:28:18,239 --> 00:28:19,199
- Don't worry little boy,

578
00:28:19,199 --> 00:28:21,326
we're just gonna teach you
some manners, that's all.

579
00:28:21,326 --> 00:28:22,744
- What the fuck are you doing?

580
00:28:22,744 --> 00:28:25,246
- Trish, get me the pool cue.

581
00:28:26,748 --> 00:28:28,625
Did you say, fuck you?

582
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:35,548
Look at the size of that.

583
00:28:41,137 --> 00:28:43,556
(screaming)

584
00:28:59,072 --> 00:28:59,948
- Here he is.

585
00:28:59,948 --> 00:29:01,491
Come on, let's go.

586
00:29:03,076 --> 00:29:04,994
Can we have a word with you, sir?

587
00:29:04,994 --> 00:29:07,288
Can we have a word from you, sir?

588
00:29:07,288 --> 00:29:08,915
Can we have a word from you?

589
00:29:08,915 --> 00:29:11,584
Please sir, can we have a word?

590
00:29:13,545 --> 00:29:15,755
How does it feel in there, sir?

591
00:29:15,755 --> 00:29:17,841
- I will tell you only one thing.

592
00:29:17,841 --> 00:29:21,219
I am completely believing in
the American justice system.

593
00:29:22,429 --> 00:29:23,722
I know in the end I will be vindicated.

594
00:29:23,722 --> 00:29:26,057
- [Woman] Somebody aught
to waste that fucker.

595
00:29:26,057 --> 00:29:26,933
- [Woman] Who is he?

596
00:29:26,933 --> 00:29:28,101
- [Woman] Carl Varna, real scum.

597
00:29:28,101 --> 00:29:29,644
- Yeah, he buys and he sells kids,

598
00:29:29,644 --> 00:29:32,230
gets them into pornography
and prostitution, you name it.

599
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:33,606
This guy's filthy rich.

600
00:29:33,606 --> 00:29:35,567
- Heard he does snuff films, too.

601
00:29:35,567 --> 00:29:36,443
- What's that?

602
00:29:36,443 --> 00:29:38,528
- Ladies, can we change the subject, here?

603
00:29:38,528 --> 00:29:39,446
- Well what's gonna happen to him?

604
00:29:39,446 --> 00:29:40,321
- Not enough.

605
00:29:40,321 --> 00:29:42,615
You know I'm afraid they're
just gonna deport the prick.

606
00:29:42,615 --> 00:29:45,243
- He's with the Coretta crime
family, very well connected.

607
00:29:45,243 --> 00:29:46,453
- [Woman] Yeah, and well protected.

608
00:29:46,453 --> 00:29:49,330
He never goes anywhere without
his (indistinct) Jesse.

609
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:52,125
- Look, I know where he
lives, I saw it on TV.

610
00:29:52,125 --> 00:29:53,668
- Jesse.

611
00:29:53,668 --> 00:29:56,588
This is not the time or
the place for that shit.

612
00:30:11,811 --> 00:30:14,314
(punk music)

613
00:30:21,988 --> 00:30:23,031
- So how you doing tonight, Jen?

614
00:30:23,031 --> 00:30:24,157
- Great.

615
00:30:24,157 --> 00:30:25,658
God, I made more money tonight

616
00:30:25,658 --> 00:30:27,202
than my husband did in a week.

617
00:30:27,202 --> 00:30:29,329
(gun firing)

618
00:30:29,329 --> 00:30:31,790
(screaming)

619
00:30:33,792 --> 00:30:35,502
(gun firing)

620
00:30:35,502 --> 00:30:38,713
- Don't fucking move, or
I'll blow you all to hell.

621
00:30:38,713 --> 00:30:39,589
Listen up.

622
00:30:39,589 --> 00:30:41,341
I'm looking for whoever the fuck it was

623
00:30:41,341 --> 00:30:43,134
that fucked up my kid brother.

624
00:30:43,134 --> 00:30:44,302
- You looking for somebody?

625
00:30:44,302 --> 00:30:45,261
- Fuck that gun, bitch,

626
00:30:45,261 --> 00:30:47,681
or I'll blow her fucking head off.

627
00:30:47,681 --> 00:30:49,641
Hear me cunt, I'll waste her.

628
00:30:49,641 --> 00:30:51,267
- You kill her, and I kill you.

629
00:30:52,352 --> 00:30:54,145
- No please.

630
00:30:54,145 --> 00:30:55,939
- Okay, make it a fucking stand off.

631
00:30:55,939 --> 00:30:57,649
When the cops bust in,

632
00:30:57,649 --> 00:31:00,652
I'll tell 'em all I know
about this goddamn joint.

633
00:31:00,652 --> 00:31:02,946
I'll tell 'em what you
did to my kid brother.

634
00:31:02,946 --> 00:31:05,532
(sirens approaching)
(tires squealing)

635
00:31:05,532 --> 00:31:08,910
(gun firing)
(Jen screaming)

636
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:10,537
- Police, drop the fucking gun.

637
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,582
(dark music)

638
00:31:18,461 --> 00:31:19,546
- Whoa.

639
00:31:19,546 --> 00:31:22,257
We hear that was quite
a shot you made, Jesse.

640
00:31:22,257 --> 00:31:24,217
You're a regular Dirty Harry.

641
00:31:24,217 --> 00:31:25,844
How'd you get to be so good with a gun?

642
00:31:25,844 --> 00:31:28,430
- Well, I've been around
guns my whole life.

643
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:30,181
My daddy was a Green Beret.

644
00:31:32,058 --> 00:31:33,393
Good old dad.

645
00:31:33,393 --> 00:31:36,646
Wanted to make sure I learned
how to shoot properly,

646
00:31:36,646 --> 00:31:38,440
even if I was just a girl.

647
00:31:40,358 --> 00:31:42,360
Came pretty naturally to me, actually.

648
00:31:43,737 --> 00:31:45,488
Okay, so everything's cool.

649
00:31:45,488 --> 00:31:46,990
You guys, the gun's licensed.

650
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:48,283
You have all the paperwork.

651
00:31:48,283 --> 00:31:49,868
- Oh yeah, everything's cool.

652
00:31:49,868 --> 00:31:51,369
The gun's legal.

653
00:31:51,369 --> 00:31:52,245
It's not in your name.

654
00:31:52,245 --> 00:31:53,747
- Oh no shit.

655
00:31:53,747 --> 00:31:55,373
It's Annie's gun.

656
00:31:59,002 --> 00:32:01,004
What did you guys expect
me to go hide in the back

657
00:32:01,004 --> 00:32:03,757
and wait for you heroes in
blue to come and save the day?

658
00:32:03,757 --> 00:32:05,300
I mean that fucking nut case

659
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:07,844
could have killed everyone in here.

660
00:32:07,844 --> 00:32:09,763
I bet I saved a few lives.

661
00:32:09,763 --> 00:32:11,639
- So why did Annie give you her gun?

662
00:32:11,639 --> 00:32:14,142
- Because I manage this place for her.

663
00:32:14,142 --> 00:32:16,186
I'm the one that risks her ass every night

664
00:32:16,186 --> 00:32:17,854
to make the goddamn bank drop.

665
00:32:17,854 --> 00:32:19,147
- Listen, Jesse,

666
00:32:19,147 --> 00:32:21,775
you can't carry a gun in
this city without a permit.

667
00:32:21,775 --> 00:32:22,901
That's gonna get you cute little ass

668
00:32:22,901 --> 00:32:25,028
a year minimum at Rikers.

669
00:32:25,028 --> 00:32:27,864
- Well, I guess I'm lucky I
never got caught then, huh?

670
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,784
Look, could we wrap this up?

671
00:32:30,784 --> 00:32:32,285
- No, you still haven't
told us why the shooter,

672
00:32:32,285 --> 00:32:33,328
what was his name, partner?

673
00:32:33,328 --> 00:32:34,204
- Eddie Jarvis.

674
00:32:34,204 --> 00:32:36,039
- Yeah, why'd Jarvis want
to kill everybody in here?

675
00:32:36,039 --> 00:32:37,665
Now, why was he so angry, Jesse?

676
00:32:37,665 --> 00:32:39,250
- How the fuck should I know?

677
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:41,461
maybe he propositioned
a bunch of the dancers

678
00:32:41,461 --> 00:32:43,713
and they all turned him down.

679
00:32:43,713 --> 00:32:46,424
That usually pisses 'em off pretty good.

680
00:32:46,424 --> 00:32:49,052
I mean they all have such
delicate little egos.

681
00:32:49,052 --> 00:32:50,428
- Jesse cut the shit.

682
00:32:50,428 --> 00:32:51,513
- How should I know?

683
00:32:51,513 --> 00:32:52,430
He was a junkie.

684
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:54,140
Why don't you take blood samples?

685
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:55,517
- Look sweetie, cut the bullshit.

686
00:32:55,517 --> 00:32:57,185
- Don't fucking call me sweetie!

687
00:32:59,187 --> 00:33:02,315
- If he was on anything,
forensics will let us know.

688
00:33:02,315 --> 00:33:05,151
Now, why don't you be a good girl

689
00:33:05,151 --> 00:33:07,987
and tell us what he was saying
right before you capped him?

690
00:33:07,987 --> 00:33:10,031
- So does he call you girl on the job?

691
00:33:10,031 --> 00:33:11,616
- Answer the question, Jesse.

692
00:33:13,326 --> 00:33:14,202
- All right.

693
00:33:16,663 --> 00:33:18,581
What was the question?

694
00:33:18,581 --> 00:33:20,834
- What was he saying
before you capped him?

695
00:33:20,834 --> 00:33:22,669
- He was talking bullshit.

696
00:33:22,669 --> 00:33:24,462
- Yeah well, a few of
the a customers claim

697
00:33:24,462 --> 00:33:25,839
that they heard Jarvis said

698
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:27,757
he wanted revenge for his brother.

699
00:33:27,757 --> 00:33:29,300
Now, why would he say that Jesse?

700
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:31,344
- [Grady] Yeah Jesse,
why would he say that?

701
00:33:31,344 --> 00:33:33,596
- Look, I've told you everything I know.

702
00:33:33,596 --> 00:33:35,515
I don't have the time or the interest

703
00:33:35,515 --> 00:33:37,142
to keep track of every nut and his brother

704
00:33:37,142 --> 00:33:38,601
who comes in this place.

705
00:33:43,273 --> 00:33:44,149
- All right.

706
00:33:46,067 --> 00:33:48,028
That'll be enough for now.

707
00:33:48,028 --> 00:33:49,487
But you say in town

708
00:33:49,487 --> 00:33:52,824
because we may need to speak
to you again in a few days.

709
00:33:52,824 --> 00:33:55,493
- You got a problem with that, Jesse?

710
00:33:55,493 --> 00:33:56,911
- Do I have a choice?

711
00:34:03,626 --> 00:34:04,669
- What do you think?

712
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,213
- I think she doesn't like cops.

713
00:34:07,213 --> 00:34:08,798
- Yeah, we should
definitely check her out,

714
00:34:08,798 --> 00:34:10,383
and Jarvis's brother, too.

715
00:34:10,383 --> 00:34:11,217
- Oh yeah.

716
00:34:12,218 --> 00:34:13,636
- What about that waitress?

717
00:34:14,763 --> 00:34:16,222
- [Grady] What about her?

718
00:34:16,222 --> 00:34:17,390
- I've seen her somewhere before.

719
00:34:17,390 --> 00:34:18,683
Did anybody get a statement out of her?

720
00:34:18,683 --> 00:34:20,060
- No.

721
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:21,895
The woman that owns a place
that she just started last week,

722
00:34:21,895 --> 00:34:23,146
she's not gonna know anything.

723
00:34:23,146 --> 00:34:24,189
Besides, we oughta leave her alone

724
00:34:24,189 --> 00:34:25,523
after what she's been through.

725
00:34:25,523 --> 00:34:26,358
- What's you mean, leave her alone?

726
00:34:26,358 --> 00:34:28,026
What, you turning soft
on me already, Grady?

727
00:34:28,026 --> 00:34:30,612
- Jesus Christ Billie, look at her.

728
00:34:30,612 --> 00:34:33,281
They're cleaning Jarvis's
brains out of her hair, okay?

729
00:34:33,281 --> 00:34:36,201
We'll come back in a couple
of days and get a statement.

730
00:34:36,201 --> 00:34:37,786
- I've seen her somewhere.

731
00:34:37,786 --> 00:34:39,913
- [Grady] All I wanna
see now is breakfast.

732
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:45,377
His name's Raleigh.

733
00:34:45,377 --> 00:34:46,378
- Who?

734
00:34:46,378 --> 00:34:48,505
- Raleigh Jarvis, Eddie's younger brother.

735
00:34:48,505 --> 00:34:49,381
And just like Eddie,

736
00:34:49,381 --> 00:34:52,342
he's a card-carrying Hell's
Angel 3rd Street chapter.

737
00:34:52,342 --> 00:34:53,760
- Does he have a sheet?

738
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,178
- OD-ed four weeks ago.

739
00:34:55,178 --> 00:34:58,640
- Shit, stay on the right, right?

740
00:34:58,640 --> 00:34:59,599
So was it suicide?

741
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:02,018
- Well, it sure as hell looks like it.

742
00:35:02,018 --> 00:35:04,187
See Eddie found him unconscious, right?

743
00:35:04,187 --> 00:35:06,690
Takes him over to Beth Israel,
gets his stomach pumped,

744
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:07,649
and there was so many fuckin' pills

745
00:35:07,649 --> 00:35:08,566
it was like a drug store,

746
00:35:08,566 --> 00:35:11,444
not to mention traces
of cocaine and booze.

747
00:35:11,444 --> 00:35:13,822
- Yeah, Eddie said he wanted
revenge for his brother, right?

748
00:35:13,822 --> 00:35:14,698
- Yeah.

749
00:35:14,698 --> 00:35:15,615
- Maybe something happened
at the Widow's Den

750
00:35:15,615 --> 00:35:17,033
that pushed him to suicide.

751
00:35:17,951 --> 00:35:19,202
- Like?

752
00:35:19,202 --> 00:35:20,286
- I don't know.

753
00:35:20,286 --> 00:35:22,163
Maybe they messed him up or something.

754
00:35:22,163 --> 00:35:23,248
- Hm.

755
00:35:23,248 --> 00:35:24,499
I don't know about that,

756
00:35:24,499 --> 00:35:27,293
but I did get the low down on Jesse.

757
00:35:29,129 --> 00:35:30,505
- So spit it out, partner.

758
00:35:32,298 --> 00:35:35,510
- [Grady] Jesse Skinner
shot and killed her father,

759
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:38,346
Colonel Frank Skinner,
at the tender age of 14.

760
00:35:39,973 --> 00:35:41,766
She claimed the old man
started molesting her

761
00:35:41,766 --> 00:35:44,477
and her younger sister Trish
right after their mother died.

762
00:35:44,477 --> 00:35:45,854
- Jesus, looks like daddy taught her

763
00:35:45,854 --> 00:35:47,188
to shoot pretty good, huh?

764
00:35:47,188 --> 00:35:49,357
- [Grady] Colonel Frank
was a real John Wayne type.

765
00:35:49,357 --> 00:35:50,316
Fought in two wars,

766
00:35:50,316 --> 00:35:52,027
got every medal there is to get.

767
00:35:52,027 --> 00:35:53,945
At Fort Benning, they
practically worshiped the guy,

768
00:35:53,945 --> 00:35:56,281
so nobody believed Jesse's story.

769
00:35:56,281 --> 00:35:57,532
- [Billie] What a surprise.

770
00:35:57,532 --> 00:35:59,200
- [Grady] Jesse ended
up at the Elvira home

771
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,493
for disturbed children.

772
00:36:00,493 --> 00:36:02,787
She kept busting out,
fighting with other inmates,

773
00:36:02,787 --> 00:36:04,205
even stabbed the doctor.

774
00:36:04,205 --> 00:36:05,081
So they bumped her up

775
00:36:05,081 --> 00:36:07,959
to the Georgia State
Correctional Facility for Women.

776
00:36:07,959 --> 00:36:10,670
- [Billie] A 15-year-old
girl in the Georgia pen?

777
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:12,255
- [Grady] Jesse spent three years there,

778
00:36:12,255 --> 00:36:14,049
finally released on her 18th birthday,

779
00:36:14,049 --> 00:36:15,759
considered fully rehabilitated.

780
00:36:16,676 --> 00:36:18,636
- [Billie] What about her sister?

781
00:36:18,636 --> 00:36:20,305
- [Grady] Trish was bounced
from one foster home

782
00:36:20,305 --> 00:36:22,515
to the other, nobody wanted her.

783
00:36:22,515 --> 00:36:25,101
She ran off to New York
as soon as she turned 18.

784
00:36:25,101 --> 00:36:28,021
Her record's clean except for
a few shoplifting charges.

785
00:36:29,564 --> 00:36:32,400
(women yelling)

786
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,486
- [Billie] Anything big on the others?

787
00:36:34,486 --> 00:36:35,904
- [Billie] Grace Ferrell was a call girl

788
00:36:35,904 --> 00:36:37,113
on the upper east side.

789
00:36:37,113 --> 00:36:39,449
One time she beat the shit
out of a British diplomat

790
00:36:39,449 --> 00:36:41,034
with a spike-heeled pump.

791
00:36:41,034 --> 00:36:43,870
Could have done time, only the
guy wouldn't press charges.

792
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:45,580
Didn't want his wife to find out.

793
00:36:46,664 --> 00:36:49,167
Vice busted Priscilla
Soto over a dozen times

794
00:36:49,167 --> 00:36:50,293
for street walking.

795
00:36:50,293 --> 00:36:52,045
She was the prime suspect in the murder

796
00:36:52,045 --> 00:36:53,797
of a west side pimp a few years ago,

797
00:36:53,797 --> 00:36:56,883
only the prick wasn't too
popular with the boys downtown.

798
00:36:56,883 --> 00:36:59,219
They called it self-defense
and let her walk.

799
00:37:00,553 --> 00:37:02,722
Now get this, back in '88,

800
00:37:02,722 --> 00:37:05,392
the FBI caught Becky Greer
and a gang of militants

801
00:37:05,392 --> 00:37:08,144
breaking into a National
Guard armory in the Bronx.

802
00:37:08,144 --> 00:37:10,188
Feds claimed Becky and
her friends were planning

803
00:37:10,188 --> 00:37:12,816
to arm terrorist groups
in the US and Mexico.

804
00:37:12,816 --> 00:37:14,651
She was lucky, only got five years

805
00:37:14,651 --> 00:37:16,444
at the federal lockup in Pennsylvania.

806
00:37:16,444 --> 00:37:18,571
Out in three for good behavior.

807
00:37:18,571 --> 00:37:19,823
She was the youngest of the bunch.

808
00:37:19,823 --> 00:37:21,449
- [Billie] Was Jesse involved?

809
00:37:21,449 --> 00:37:22,450
- [Grady] Not that we know of.

810
00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:24,494
Jesse dropped outta
sight till the late 70's

811
00:37:24,494 --> 00:37:27,372
when she came to New York to
hook up with her sister Trish.

812
00:37:27,372 --> 00:37:30,458
She worked odd jobs, took classes at NYU,

813
00:37:30,458 --> 00:37:32,210
finally ended up running the Widow's Den,

814
00:37:32,210 --> 00:37:35,630
which by the way happens to
be owned by Annie Friedlander,

815
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:39,050
former rape counselor, big
time activist in the 60's.

816
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:41,386
- [Billie] A feminist running a go-go bar?

817
00:37:41,386 --> 00:37:43,805
- [Grady] LCB says the bar
used to belong to her brother

818
00:37:43,805 --> 00:37:46,474
until he died of a stroke
at 75 and willed to her.

819
00:37:46,474 --> 00:37:48,601
That place is a real cash cow,

820
00:37:48,601 --> 00:37:50,395
pulls in nearly 200 G's a year,

821
00:37:50,395 --> 00:37:51,646
and that's on the books.

822
00:37:52,522 --> 00:37:53,690
- [Billie] So what have
they all been up to

823
00:37:53,690 --> 00:37:55,608
since Annie took them in?

824
00:37:55,608 --> 00:37:57,402
- [Billie] Nothing illegal, apparently,

825
00:37:57,402 --> 00:37:58,987
turned into a bunch of angels.

826
00:38:03,241 --> 00:38:04,909
- [Billie] Maybe they found religion.

827
00:38:04,909 --> 00:38:06,077
- [Grady] Yeah, right.

828
00:38:10,248 --> 00:38:12,292
- [Billie] Well, if this town's
got a vigilante hit squad,

829
00:38:12,292 --> 00:38:15,086
these women are the perfect suspects.

830
00:38:15,086 --> 00:38:15,962
Thanks.

831
00:38:19,924 --> 00:38:23,011
Well, you know, this doesn't
prove anything, right partner?

832
00:38:23,011 --> 00:38:25,263
But I think we're headed
in the right direction.

833
00:38:25,263 --> 00:38:27,807
- Well, it sure as hell looks like it.

834
00:38:27,807 --> 00:38:29,768
- So what do you say, you with me on this?

835
00:38:29,768 --> 00:38:31,895
- Yeah, of course, you're
goddamn right I am.

836
00:38:31,895 --> 00:38:34,814
Look, if we solve these
killings, we'll be legends.

837
00:38:34,814 --> 00:38:36,149
They'll make fucking movies about us.

838
00:38:36,149 --> 00:38:38,651
- Yeah right, my part'll
be played by Bridget Fonda,

839
00:38:38,651 --> 00:38:40,403
or somebody like her.

840
00:38:42,113 --> 00:38:44,741
(rock music)

841
00:38:47,994 --> 00:38:49,496
♪ You say she was a slut ♪

842
00:38:49,496 --> 00:38:51,331
♪ She wanted your sex ♪

843
00:38:51,331 --> 00:38:54,292
(lyrics muffled)

844
00:40:15,790 --> 00:40:18,418
- Last night in Manhattan's
lower east side,

845
00:40:18,418 --> 00:40:20,754
a 14-year-old girl was found unconscious

846
00:40:20,754 --> 00:40:22,756
in the trunk of an abandoned car.

847
00:40:22,756 --> 00:40:25,133
She was apparently abducted
on her way home from school,

848
00:40:25,133 --> 00:40:27,260
and repeatedly raped and beaten.

849
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:28,928
Police suspect a local drug gang,

850
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:31,723
but are receiving little
cooperation from the neighborhood.

851
00:40:31,723 --> 00:40:32,974
There's speculation residents-

852
00:40:32,974 --> 00:40:34,017
- Those bastards.

853
00:40:34,893 --> 00:40:36,144
They should choke on their fucking balls.

854
00:40:36,144 --> 00:40:38,188
- [News Reporter] The girl
is now in critical condition

855
00:40:38,188 --> 00:40:39,981
at Saint Vincent's hospital.

856
00:40:39,981 --> 00:40:41,524
More from Natalie Ramone (indistinct).

857
00:40:41,524 --> 00:40:43,943
- Priscilla, you know that
area pretty well, don't you?

858
00:40:43,943 --> 00:40:46,404
- [Priss] Yeah, my sister
and her family live there.

859
00:40:46,404 --> 00:40:47,947
The neighborhood was never really great,

860
00:40:47,947 --> 00:40:49,324
but since the crack gangs moved in,

861
00:40:49,324 --> 00:40:51,534
it went straight down the toilet.

862
00:40:51,534 --> 00:40:53,078
- So do you think that you and Becky

863
00:40:53,078 --> 00:40:54,287
could maybe hit the streets

864
00:40:54,287 --> 00:40:56,664
and find out more than these cops know?

865
00:40:56,664 --> 00:40:58,041
- My pleasure.

866
00:40:58,041 --> 00:40:59,793
- Okay, I'll cover your shift.

867
00:41:06,132 --> 00:41:08,635
- Hey Jen, Looks like
you're gonna see some action

868
00:41:08,635 --> 00:41:09,844
sooner than we thought.

869
00:41:13,765 --> 00:41:16,643
(dramatic music)

870
00:41:22,315 --> 00:41:25,777
- All right everybody, lock and load.

871
00:41:25,777 --> 00:41:27,320
- So Jennifer, you're
gonna stay in the van,

872
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:28,613
and you're gonna keep the engine running.

873
00:41:28,613 --> 00:41:30,073
And as soon as you hear gunshots,

874
00:41:30,073 --> 00:41:32,575
you're gonna pull up to the
door and you're gonna wait.

875
00:41:32,575 --> 00:41:33,868
And if there's any sign of trouble,

876
00:41:33,868 --> 00:41:36,121
don't hesitate to use this.

877
00:41:36,121 --> 00:41:36,955
You understand me?

878
00:41:36,955 --> 00:41:37,914
- Yeah, Prissy sure.

879
00:41:37,914 --> 00:41:38,832
- Do you understand me?

880
00:41:38,832 --> 00:41:40,166
- Yes, I understand.

881
00:41:40,166 --> 00:41:41,084
- Good.

882
00:41:41,084 --> 00:41:42,711
- All right, it's time to move.

883
00:41:46,047 --> 00:41:49,718
(tense orchestral music)

884
00:41:52,095 --> 00:41:54,889
You fuck this up and so help
me I'll shoot you myself.

885
00:42:01,730 --> 00:42:03,106
- That's bullshit, Caesar.

886
00:42:03,106 --> 00:42:04,524
Don't you bullshit me.

887
00:42:04,524 --> 00:42:06,609
What kind of dumbass
prick do you take me for?

888
00:42:06,609 --> 00:42:08,778
- I swear on my mother,
I never shorted you.

889
00:42:08,778 --> 00:42:09,821
I never shorted you man.

890
00:42:09,821 --> 00:42:11,448
- For two years, I was the only one

891
00:42:11,448 --> 00:42:12,532
that ever fronted you anything.

892
00:42:12,532 --> 00:42:13,867
This is the thanks I get?

893
00:42:13,867 --> 00:42:16,703
I should string you up
by your fucking balls.

894
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:18,079
(knocking on door)

895
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:19,289
- Ola, I'm Maria.

896
00:42:19,289 --> 00:42:22,083
I'm calling you, are you guys
partying tonight or what?

897
00:42:22,083 --> 00:42:24,127
- I don't think this a
good time now, honey.

898
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:25,962
- Oh, come on baby, I
wanna party with you.

899
00:42:25,962 --> 00:42:27,756
I wanna make you happy.

900
00:42:27,756 --> 00:42:31,885
- Poison, let in the bitch. (indistinct)

901
00:42:31,885 --> 00:42:33,219
- Tell the whore to get lost.

902
00:42:33,219 --> 00:42:35,138
- Relax, relax, relax.

903
00:42:35,138 --> 00:42:36,014
Is she alone?

904
00:42:36,014 --> 00:42:37,682
- There's some bitch here, man.

905
00:42:37,682 --> 00:42:39,434
- Yeah man.

906
00:42:39,434 --> 00:42:41,644
- Who the fuck you letting in here?

907
00:42:41,644 --> 00:42:43,772
- That woman buys drugs,
okay, she buys my drugs.

908
00:42:43,772 --> 00:42:46,191
Be cool man, be cool.

909
00:42:46,191 --> 00:42:48,109
Let her in, it's okay.

910
00:42:50,904 --> 00:42:53,406
(gun firing)

911
00:42:55,950 --> 00:43:00,997
(guns firing)
(screaming)

912
00:43:14,177 --> 00:43:16,554
(yelling)

913
00:43:18,139 --> 00:43:19,849
- We're missing one.

914
00:43:21,601 --> 00:43:22,477
- Come on.

915
00:43:29,984 --> 00:43:31,611
- Shut the fuck up.

916
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:41,705
(muffled shouting)

917
00:43:44,749 --> 00:43:45,625
- No.

918
00:43:45,625 --> 00:43:48,044
(screaming)

919
00:44:16,865 --> 00:44:17,741
- Let's go!

920
00:44:17,741 --> 00:44:18,575
- What about the girl?

921
00:44:18,575 --> 00:44:20,410
- She chose her friends poorly, kill her.

922
00:44:20,410 --> 00:44:24,330
(screaming)
(gun firing)

923
00:44:24,330 --> 00:44:25,498
- Fuck.

924
00:44:25,498 --> 00:44:26,374
Shit.

925
00:44:26,374 --> 00:44:27,751
- You okay?

926
00:44:27,751 --> 00:44:30,045
- Come on, let's go.

927
00:44:30,045 --> 00:44:31,087
Come on you guys, get in the van,

928
00:44:31,087 --> 00:44:33,757
let's get the fuck out of here, go!

929
00:44:33,757 --> 00:44:34,841
- Buenos Noches, Maria.

930
00:44:34,841 --> 00:44:36,718
(screaming)

931
00:44:36,718 --> 00:44:38,553
(gun firing)

932
00:44:38,553 --> 00:44:39,721
Holy shit!

933
00:44:39,721 --> 00:44:40,847
She fucking blew them away.

934
00:44:40,847 --> 00:44:43,308
- [Woman] Come on, let's go.

935
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:49,981
- I guess the press didn't
buy our rival gang theory.

936
00:44:49,981 --> 00:44:52,901
- Lieutenant, the word on the
street says it's vigilantes.

937
00:44:52,901 --> 00:44:53,735
(phone ringing)

938
00:44:53,735 --> 00:44:55,487
- Lieutenant, that's bullshit.

939
00:44:55,487 --> 00:44:57,530
There is no way that this gang massacre

940
00:44:57,530 --> 00:45:00,033
is vengeance for the rape of that girl.

941
00:45:00,033 --> 00:45:02,243
- Why is that so hard
for you to believe, Tony?

942
00:45:02,243 --> 00:45:03,661
- We're cursed.

943
00:45:03,661 --> 00:45:06,289
- Lieutenant, listen to me
for a minute, all right?

944
00:45:06,289 --> 00:45:08,917
We're talking about an area
where they got more homicides

945
00:45:08,917 --> 00:45:10,043
than we can count, all right.

946
00:45:10,043 --> 00:45:12,754
Listen to me, half of them
are in broad daylight.

947
00:45:12,754 --> 00:45:14,881
Keeping that in mind, sir.

948
00:45:14,881 --> 00:45:17,550
What makes the rape at
this girl so special?

949
00:45:17,550 --> 00:45:19,552
- Tony look, maybe it was the last straw,

950
00:45:19,552 --> 00:45:20,845
but whatever the reason,

951
00:45:20,845 --> 00:45:23,014
forensics is certain that a straight razor

952
00:45:23,014 --> 00:45:26,810
was used to castrate both
Josh Gilby and Ramon Garcia,

953
00:45:26,810 --> 00:45:28,311
the leader of the murdered gang.

954
00:45:28,311 --> 00:45:29,688
- It's gotta be a coincidence.

955
00:45:29,688 --> 00:45:32,315
Rival gangs are cutting
themselves up all the time.

956
00:45:32,315 --> 00:45:33,566
This is nothing new.

957
00:45:33,566 --> 00:45:37,320
- Listen gang, let's think
long term here for a change.

958
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:38,780
All right?

959
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:41,199
Follow what I'm talking about.

960
00:45:41,199 --> 00:45:42,784
You got a nut running around the streets.

961
00:45:42,784 --> 00:45:45,620
All right, the guy commits
some heinous sex crime,

962
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:48,957
a rape or sodomy, whatever it
is, the guy takes a collar.

963
00:45:48,957 --> 00:45:49,833
Lot of press on it.

964
00:45:49,833 --> 00:45:50,709
He winds up in court,

965
00:45:50,709 --> 00:45:52,919
for some bullshit technicality he walks.

966
00:45:52,919 --> 00:45:54,963
The guy's not home an hour
before my phone rings.

967
00:45:54,963 --> 00:45:57,465
I got a DOA with a dick in a bottle.

968
00:45:57,465 --> 00:45:58,717
Follow me?

969
00:45:58,717 --> 00:46:01,136
Now, let's think back a little bit.

970
00:46:01,136 --> 00:46:03,221
You got the gang massacre last night.

971
00:46:03,221 --> 00:46:05,181
You got the Gilby homicide.

972
00:46:05,181 --> 00:46:06,933
Before that you got the gynecologist.

973
00:46:06,933 --> 00:46:09,519
You remember the guy that
raped the six patients?

974
00:46:09,519 --> 00:46:11,104
Okay, and before that Farentino,

975
00:46:11,104 --> 00:46:13,481
the gym teacher's probably our first one.

976
00:46:13,481 --> 00:46:15,900
You remember him with the
rapes of them little boys?

977
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:17,861
That's called a pattern.

978
00:46:17,861 --> 00:46:19,112
And I got news for you.

979
00:46:19,112 --> 00:46:20,363
Not only do we got a pattern here,

980
00:46:20,363 --> 00:46:21,322
but we got a crew of people

981
00:46:21,322 --> 00:46:23,199
that are getting more
violent with every case.

982
00:46:23,199 --> 00:46:26,161
- Okay Lieutenant, following
that train of thought,

983
00:46:26,161 --> 00:46:28,371
Perez's been investigating the case.

984
00:46:28,371 --> 00:46:30,665
She says they're vigilantes.

985
00:46:30,665 --> 00:46:32,042
Who are they?

986
00:46:32,042 --> 00:46:32,917
- Billie?

987
00:46:32,917 --> 00:46:34,336
- I think they're women.

988
00:46:34,336 --> 00:46:36,296
- Oh, she's out of her mind.

989
00:46:36,296 --> 00:46:37,422
- This is getting too wild.

990
00:46:37,422 --> 00:46:39,132
I mean now we got a bunch of crazed chicks

991
00:46:39,132 --> 00:46:40,258
running around with guns.

992
00:46:40,258 --> 00:46:41,760
It's attack of the killer bimbos

993
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:42,635
or something here, Lieutenant.

994
00:46:42,635 --> 00:46:45,096
- Cahill, Cahill, shut your
hole a minute, all right?

995
00:46:45,096 --> 00:46:46,264
- Okay.

996
00:46:46,264 --> 00:46:47,140
- Grady, what do you think about

997
00:46:47,140 --> 00:46:48,516
what your partner's got to say?

998
00:46:48,516 --> 00:46:49,976
- My senior partner's got a gut feeling.

999
00:46:49,976 --> 00:46:51,686
Who am I to questioned it, right?

1000
00:46:52,562 --> 00:46:53,646
- Listen, Billie's been the only one

1001
00:46:53,646 --> 00:46:55,690
that's been consistent
on this from day one.

1002
00:46:55,690 --> 00:46:57,609
You tie that in with her
background in sex crimes

1003
00:46:57,609 --> 00:46:58,777
before she came to homicide,

1004
00:46:58,777 --> 00:47:00,445
I like her as the number one on this.

1005
00:47:00,445 --> 00:47:02,405
Billie, you carry the
ball from here on in.

1006
00:47:02,405 --> 00:47:04,282
- Lieutenant, that's bullshit.

1007
00:47:04,282 --> 00:47:05,867
- Excuse me.

1008
00:47:05,867 --> 00:47:10,246
Detective Perez is number one
on this case from here on in.

1009
00:47:10,246 --> 00:47:12,707
- Boss, boss, Tony and I have seniority

1010
00:47:12,707 --> 00:47:14,626
over detective Perez and Grady here.

1011
00:47:14,626 --> 00:47:17,003
- Cahill, unless you'd
like to take that seniority

1012
00:47:17,003 --> 00:47:18,046
down to the Lincoln Tunnel,

1013
00:47:18,046 --> 00:47:19,673
where you're gonna be
wearing a reflecting belt

1014
00:47:19,673 --> 00:47:20,924
with a whistle stock in your mouth

1015
00:47:20,924 --> 00:47:22,133
for the rest of your career,

1016
00:47:22,133 --> 00:47:24,260
I advise you to shut your mouth.

1017
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:25,136
- I know.

1018
00:47:25,136 --> 00:47:26,012
Look, what I want.
- Shut.

1019
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:30,392
All right, now the four of you
get the fuck outta my office.

1020
00:47:30,392 --> 00:47:31,267
Get to work.

1021
00:47:36,898 --> 00:47:39,442
(muffled speaking)

1022
00:47:39,442 --> 00:47:42,570
- [Grady] I guess just being
you Cahill is all it takes.

1023
00:47:42,570 --> 00:47:43,947
- [Cahill And Tony] Fuck you.

1024
00:47:43,947 --> 00:47:46,449
(rock music)

1025
00:47:56,501 --> 00:48:00,005
♪ Gonna make you blush ♪

1026
00:48:04,009 --> 00:48:06,553
- Well, have you guys
read the papers today?

1027
00:48:06,553 --> 00:48:08,847
- Yeah, I think we made the
front page on all of them.

1028
00:48:08,847 --> 00:48:10,223
- Oh, that's right.

1029
00:48:10,223 --> 00:48:11,349
- So what's wrong?

1030
00:48:11,349 --> 00:48:13,226
You don't seem very happy about that.

1031
00:48:13,226 --> 00:48:15,645
- I'm not very happy, Grace,

1032
00:48:15,645 --> 00:48:17,188
Look, you guys are so
pleased with yourself

1033
00:48:17,188 --> 00:48:19,190
'cause you wasted a few pieces of shit?

1034
00:48:19,190 --> 00:48:21,026
- Yeah, we are, aren't we happy?

1035
00:48:21,026 --> 00:48:22,444
- Well, while you're here partying,

1036
00:48:22,444 --> 00:48:24,612
the whole world is sinking into the sewer.

1037
00:48:25,780 --> 00:48:28,116
- Jesse, what is wrong?

1038
00:48:28,116 --> 00:48:29,993
- What's wrong? Look at that, Trish.

1039
00:48:35,832 --> 00:48:38,001
- Judge Sawyer is acquitted.

1040
00:48:38,001 --> 00:48:40,003
- They let the fucking bastard off.

1041
00:48:40,879 --> 00:48:42,047
- Who is that?

1042
00:48:42,047 --> 00:48:43,965
- Judge Phillip Sawyer, the state justice

1043
00:48:43,965 --> 00:48:46,051
that raped and beat a young call girl.

1044
00:48:46,051 --> 00:48:48,345
- Wait a minute, I thought
she dropped the charges.

1045
00:48:48,345 --> 00:48:49,387
Oh, come on Grace,

1046
00:48:49,387 --> 00:48:51,056
you don't actually believe that shit.

1047
00:48:51,056 --> 00:48:52,307
Man, they leaned on her.

1048
00:48:53,516 --> 00:48:55,477
We can't let them get away with this.

1049
00:48:56,853 --> 00:49:00,148
- Christ, Jesse, he's on
the state Supreme Court.

1050
00:49:01,066 --> 00:49:02,817
- He raped and beat a woman.

1051
00:49:02,817 --> 00:49:05,320
I don't care if he's
the fuckin' president.

1052
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:07,322
- Calm down, Jess.

1053
00:49:07,322 --> 00:49:08,281
- Okay, all right.

1054
00:49:08,281 --> 00:49:09,532
You know, we've gotta act on it.

1055
00:49:09,532 --> 00:49:10,867
We gotta send a message out there

1056
00:49:10,867 --> 00:49:12,660
that nobody gets away with rape,

1057
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:13,953
no matter who they are.

1058
00:49:22,671 --> 00:49:26,049
- Hey Tony, did you see
anything out of the ordinary?

1059
00:49:26,049 --> 00:49:27,342
- Nothing.

1060
00:49:27,342 --> 00:49:30,303
Four straight days, not a fucking thing.

1061
00:49:30,303 --> 00:49:33,014
This whole gig's a bust.

1062
00:49:33,014 --> 00:49:36,184
- Hey rookie, you got any
messages for your fiance?

1063
00:49:36,184 --> 00:49:37,352
Going to her house now.

1064
00:49:38,395 --> 00:49:39,270
Goodnight.

1065
00:49:43,817 --> 00:49:45,777
- Thanks Billie, for volunteering
us for the night shift.

1066
00:49:45,777 --> 00:49:48,113
It's nice, 'cause I don't
fight with my fiance anymore.

1067
00:49:48,113 --> 00:49:50,448
Maybe 'cause I don't
fucking see her anymore.

1068
00:49:50,448 --> 00:49:53,201
- Grady, you think those two
clowns would've stayed awake?

1069
00:49:53,201 --> 00:49:54,077
Huh?

1070
00:50:03,169 --> 00:50:05,839
(dog barking)

1071
00:50:09,843 --> 00:50:10,677
- Four days.

1072
00:50:13,096 --> 00:50:15,140
Four goddamn days, you'd
think they'd give us a radio

1073
00:50:15,140 --> 00:50:16,349
so we can listen to some music.

1074
00:50:16,349 --> 00:50:17,475
- Grady, fuck the radio.

1075
00:50:17,475 --> 00:50:19,352
Just keep your eyes open, all right?

1076
00:50:22,105 --> 00:50:24,232
- Fuckin' eyelids feel like
they're made outta lead.

1077
00:50:27,152 --> 00:50:30,405
(dog barking)

1078
00:50:30,405 --> 00:50:31,281
Sure.

1079
00:50:32,532 --> 00:50:34,159
That's nice, we're out of coffee.

1080
00:50:34,159 --> 00:50:35,118
Ain't it the best?

1081
00:50:35,994 --> 00:50:39,497
(dog barking)

1082
00:50:39,497 --> 00:50:40,957
What makes you so goddamn sure

1083
00:50:40,957 --> 00:50:42,125
they're gonna whack this judge?

1084
00:50:42,125 --> 00:50:43,668
- Grady, I told you.

1085
00:50:43,668 --> 00:50:46,004
The case is all over the
TV and the newspapers,

1086
00:50:46,004 --> 00:50:48,298
and besides that son
of a bitch deserves it.

1087
00:50:50,008 --> 00:50:50,925
- Cahill's right.

1088
00:50:52,218 --> 00:50:53,928
You're on their side.

1089
00:50:53,928 --> 00:50:56,014
- Grady, you know you're
my fucking partner.

1090
00:50:56,014 --> 00:50:57,140
Now, why don't you try giving me

1091
00:50:57,140 --> 00:50:58,266
a little support for a change,

1092
00:50:58,266 --> 00:51:00,018
instead of beating me down
with the rest of them.

1093
00:51:00,018 --> 00:51:00,894
- I'm sorry.

1094
00:51:07,067 --> 00:51:08,568
Look, I'm just really fucking tired, okay?

1095
00:51:08,568 --> 00:51:09,444
I'm sorry.

1096
00:51:14,657 --> 00:51:17,118
I'm gonna go out and
take a piss, all right?

1097
00:51:17,118 --> 00:51:19,245
- One of the many
advantages of being a man,

1098
00:51:19,245 --> 00:51:21,331
just pull it out and the street, right?

1099
00:51:25,627 --> 00:51:27,962
- Well I can't really
argue with that now, can I?

1100
00:51:27,962 --> 00:51:30,090
- Grady, come on, it's a
respectable neighborhood.

1101
00:51:30,090 --> 00:51:31,841
Now go in the judge's
house and take a piss.

1102
00:51:31,841 --> 00:51:32,717
You have the key.

1103
00:51:35,053 --> 00:51:36,596
- You're nagging me here, you know that,

1104
00:51:36,596 --> 00:51:37,639
like we're married, you're nagging me.

1105
00:51:37,639 --> 00:51:38,932
- Yeah, in your dreams.

1106
00:51:38,932 --> 00:51:40,558
Come on Grady, make it fast.

1107
00:51:42,435 --> 00:51:45,563
(car alert dinging)

1108
00:51:49,234 --> 00:51:51,069
- Might as well hit up
your honor for some coffee

1109
00:51:51,069 --> 00:51:52,028
while I'm in there.

1110
00:51:59,285 --> 00:52:00,161
- Grady?

1111
00:52:01,204 --> 00:52:02,038
Grady!

1112
00:52:04,207 --> 00:52:05,542
Left his damn radio.

1113
00:52:09,129 --> 00:52:11,631
It's 3:30, what the
hell are we doing here?

1114
00:52:17,012 --> 00:52:19,597
(dog barking)

1115
00:52:22,726 --> 00:52:26,062
Damn it Grady, you got
the worst fucking timing.

1116
00:52:26,062 --> 00:52:28,023
This is Detective Perez,

1117
00:52:28,023 --> 00:52:31,985
requesting backup at 5250 Riverdale Drive.

1118
00:52:31,985 --> 00:52:35,238
Repeat, this is Detective
Perez, requesting backup,

1119
00:52:35,238 --> 00:52:37,115
5250 Riverdale Drive.

1120
00:52:38,158 --> 00:52:40,118
- [Dispatcher] Detective
Perez, there is a 1013

1121
00:52:40,118 --> 00:52:43,246
already in progress in that quarter.

1122
00:52:48,918 --> 00:52:50,879
- [Woman] Come on, get the lead out.

1123
00:52:50,879 --> 00:52:53,465
(guns firing)

1124
00:53:01,681 --> 00:53:04,267
(guns firing)

1125
00:53:10,607 --> 00:53:11,900
- They got Trish.

1126
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:12,776
- No!

1127
00:53:12,776 --> 00:53:14,277
- Try the house.

1128
00:53:14,277 --> 00:53:16,112
Grab her fucking leg.

1129
00:53:21,159 --> 00:53:22,619
- [Billie] Grady.

1130
00:53:25,830 --> 00:53:28,875
(tires squealing)

1131
00:53:31,836 --> 00:53:34,214
- Call the police.

1132
00:53:34,214 --> 00:53:35,757
My God.

1133
00:53:35,757 --> 00:53:36,675
Are you all right?

1134
00:53:36,675 --> 00:53:38,468
- Get away from him.

1135
00:53:38,468 --> 00:53:41,930
Get the fuck away from him, you bastard.

1136
00:53:41,930 --> 00:53:42,806
Get away.

1137
00:53:44,724 --> 00:53:47,602
(dog barking)

1138
00:53:47,602 --> 00:53:50,522
(sirens blaring)

1139
00:53:56,695 --> 00:53:58,822
- Oh Trish, (indistinct).

1140
00:53:58,822 --> 00:54:00,573
No, just stay with us.

1141
00:54:00,573 --> 00:54:03,410
We're gonna get you to the hospital.

1142
00:54:03,410 --> 00:54:05,829
(coughing)

1143
00:54:09,833 --> 00:54:12,419
We're taking her to the
hospital now, right Jesse?

1144
00:54:13,461 --> 00:54:15,380
Jesse, she's your sister.

1145
00:54:15,380 --> 00:54:16,256
Jesse!

1146
00:54:17,590 --> 00:54:18,967
Jesse.

1147
00:54:18,967 --> 00:54:20,260
- Will you shut up?

1148
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:22,846
We can't go the hospital, all right?

1149
00:54:22,846 --> 00:54:24,222
Don't you understand?

1150
00:54:24,222 --> 00:54:25,640
(muffled cross-talk)

1151
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:26,599
- Fuck you.

1152
00:54:27,767 --> 00:54:30,895
(confused shouting)

1153
00:54:40,905 --> 00:54:41,781
- Shit.

1154
00:54:48,204 --> 00:54:50,457
(crying)

1155
00:54:59,674 --> 00:55:00,800
- She's dead.

1156
00:55:03,053 --> 00:55:05,347
(yelling)

1157
00:55:07,098 --> 00:55:10,477
It's your fault, it's
all your fault, together.

1158
00:55:10,477 --> 00:55:11,519
Let her die.

1159
00:55:14,397 --> 00:55:16,649
(crying)

1160
00:55:48,098 --> 00:55:49,724
- It's getting late.

1161
00:55:49,724 --> 00:55:50,600
We better go.

1162
00:56:08,201 --> 00:56:10,995
(horn honking)

1163
00:56:14,416 --> 00:56:15,500
- How's the leg?

1164
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:16,418
- It's only through and through,

1165
00:56:16,418 --> 00:56:17,460
but it's fucking killing me.

1166
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:18,336
You know how it is.

1167
00:56:18,336 --> 00:56:19,629
- Yeah, I know how it is.

1168
00:56:20,505 --> 00:56:21,381
Listen.

1169
00:56:22,424 --> 00:56:24,342
You ever think about retiring?

1170
00:56:24,342 --> 00:56:27,762
You know that I could almost
guarantee you disability.

1171
00:56:27,762 --> 00:56:28,638
- Forget it.

1172
00:56:30,890 --> 00:56:33,226
- Billie, you're off the case.

1173
00:56:33,226 --> 00:56:35,228
I want you to find yourself
a nice beach someplace,

1174
00:56:35,228 --> 00:56:37,313
park your butt there
for a while and relax.

1175
00:56:37,313 --> 00:56:38,189
Okay?

1176
00:56:38,189 --> 00:56:41,359
You get back, we'll discuss
your future with the department.

1177
00:56:41,359 --> 00:56:42,902
- What the hell are you talking about?

1178
00:56:42,902 --> 00:56:46,489
- Look, I took a call
less than an hour ago.

1179
00:56:46,489 --> 00:56:49,492
Internal affairs is
handling the investigation.

1180
00:56:49,492 --> 00:56:51,953
Billie, I ain't gotta tell you.

1181
00:56:51,953 --> 00:56:53,496
Grady was your second partner you lost

1182
00:56:53,496 --> 00:56:54,873
since you came to homicide.

1183
00:56:59,210 --> 00:57:00,712
They suspended you.

1184
00:57:00,712 --> 00:57:02,255
I did everything I could for you.

1185
00:57:03,506 --> 00:57:05,258
- You gotta be fucking kidding me.

1186
00:57:06,593 --> 00:57:07,844
Look.

1187
00:57:07,844 --> 00:57:10,847
Lou, I really liked Grady,
but you know he was green.

1188
00:57:10,847 --> 00:57:12,349
Look didn't you read my report.

1189
00:57:12,349 --> 00:57:14,267
He went in the house
without his damn radio.

1190
00:57:14,267 --> 00:57:16,186
It could have happened no
matter who he was with.

1191
00:57:16,186 --> 00:57:18,521
- Listen, I know that, I told him that.

1192
00:57:20,023 --> 00:57:21,316
Billie, there's more to it than that.

1193
00:57:21,316 --> 00:57:22,192
- What?

1194
00:57:23,902 --> 00:57:25,862
I got a call from Judge Sawyer, also.

1195
00:57:27,322 --> 00:57:30,033
He says, you threatened
him with your piece?

1196
00:57:30,033 --> 00:57:31,409
Did you do that, Billie?

1197
00:57:31,409 --> 00:57:33,286
- You know what state of mind I was in.

1198
00:57:33,286 --> 00:57:34,871
- Look, I send you to guard the guy,

1199
00:57:34,871 --> 00:57:36,414
not to stick a gun in his face.

1200
00:57:36,414 --> 00:57:38,792
- I did guard him and look what it got me.

1201
00:57:41,044 --> 00:57:42,921
You know it makes me
sick the shit I see guys

1202
00:57:42,921 --> 00:57:45,173
get away with in this department.

1203
00:57:45,173 --> 00:57:46,716
But what happens to them, huh?

1204
00:57:47,592 --> 00:57:49,594
Barely a slap on the
wrist, and you know why?

1205
00:57:49,594 --> 00:57:51,513
'Cause it's a fucking boys' club.

1206
00:57:51,513 --> 00:57:53,390
I swear you don't have a
dick between your legs,

1207
00:57:53,390 --> 00:57:55,392
then honey you'd better stay on your toes,

1208
00:57:55,392 --> 00:57:56,726
because you're not one of the boys,

1209
00:57:56,726 --> 00:57:58,228
and you don't belong here, right?

1210
00:57:58,228 --> 00:57:59,646
- I'm sorry.

1211
00:57:59,646 --> 00:58:00,522
- Yeah,

1212
00:58:02,148 --> 00:58:03,733
fuck,

1213
00:58:03,733 --> 00:58:05,276
me too.

1214
00:58:05,276 --> 00:58:07,237
But I'm not quitting.

1215
00:58:07,237 --> 00:58:09,072
And if they don't want me
here, that's tough shit,

1216
00:58:09,072 --> 00:58:10,699
'cause I'm not quitting.

1217
00:58:13,993 --> 00:58:15,412
- Detective Perez.

1218
00:58:17,330 --> 00:58:19,207
I need every piece of paper you have

1219
00:58:19,207 --> 00:58:21,001
in the vigilante homicides.

1220
00:58:22,627 --> 00:58:24,337
Billie, where you going?

1221
00:58:24,337 --> 00:58:26,381
Perez, get the fuck in here.

1222
00:58:29,968 --> 00:58:32,971
- We killed a fucking cop
for Christ's sake, Jesse.

1223
00:58:32,971 --> 00:58:35,348
When one of their own
gets hit, they go berserk.

1224
00:58:35,348 --> 00:58:37,350
- Cops got nothing on us.

1225
00:58:37,350 --> 00:58:40,270
- Chris, don't you
remember Detective Perez?

1226
00:58:40,270 --> 00:58:42,439
We killed her goddamn partner.

1227
00:58:42,439 --> 00:58:43,732
- Becky, what do you say we do?

1228
00:58:43,732 --> 00:58:47,652
- Jesse, you know I'd march
straight down to hell with you,

1229
00:58:47,652 --> 00:58:49,612
but Grace is right.

1230
00:58:49,612 --> 00:58:51,573
After losing Trish and killing that cop,

1231
00:58:51,573 --> 00:58:52,866
we got no choice.

1232
00:58:52,866 --> 00:58:54,409
We gotta lay low.

1233
00:58:55,744 --> 00:58:57,370
- Man, you guys all talk about Trish

1234
00:58:57,370 --> 00:58:58,580
as if I didn't care, man,

1235
00:58:58,580 --> 00:59:00,498
as if I didn't feel responsible.

1236
00:59:00,498 --> 00:59:02,083
Well you're all fucking wrong.

1237
00:59:02,083 --> 00:59:02,959
- [Woman] Oh you are wrong, Jesse.

1238
00:59:02,959 --> 00:59:04,627
We never meant that.

1239
00:59:04,627 --> 00:59:07,380
- She was my sister for Christ's sakes.

1240
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:09,382
You think I don't feel bad, man.

1241
00:59:09,382 --> 00:59:11,468
You think it doesn't bother me?

1242
00:59:11,468 --> 00:59:13,678
It's tearing my goddamn guts out.

1243
00:59:13,678 --> 00:59:17,390
- Jesse, there's too much
fucking heat right now.

1244
00:59:17,390 --> 00:59:19,768
We murdered a police officer,

1245
00:59:21,478 --> 00:59:23,229
a detective no less.

1246
00:59:24,397 --> 00:59:26,733
You know about the time
I spent up in the joint,

1247
00:59:26,733 --> 00:59:28,526
and I ain't going back.

1248
00:59:28,526 --> 00:59:30,904
- So Becky, what are you trying to say?

1249
00:59:30,904 --> 00:59:32,864
What the fuck are you trying to say to me?

1250
00:59:32,864 --> 00:59:34,699
- I'm saying I'm with Grace.

1251
00:59:34,699 --> 00:59:37,160
We gotta split up until
the heat cools off.

1252
00:59:38,787 --> 00:59:40,789
- This is bigger than all of us.

1253
00:59:40,789 --> 00:59:43,667
We can't end it now, we've come too far.

1254
00:59:43,667 --> 00:59:46,336
We made the TV, the newspapers,

1255
00:59:46,336 --> 00:59:47,879
we've even got national coverage.

1256
00:59:47,879 --> 00:59:50,131
We're finally starting
to make an impression.

1257
00:59:50,131 --> 00:59:51,841
- Shut the fuck up Chris.

1258
00:59:51,841 --> 00:59:53,677
- You know she's right.

1259
00:59:53,677 --> 00:59:55,011
I'm gonna tell you something.

1260
00:59:55,011 --> 00:59:56,763
Man, Trish wouldn't step down.

1261
00:59:59,432 --> 01:00:02,560
- Well, whatever you all
decide, I'm outta here.

1262
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:03,436
- Where are you going?

1263
01:00:03,436 --> 01:00:05,605
- I've just had enough
of this fucking town.

1264
01:00:05,605 --> 01:00:06,648
- Is that so?

1265
01:00:07,649 --> 01:00:10,026
Funny, that doesn't surprise me at all.

1266
01:00:10,026 --> 01:00:12,570
Just when things start heating
up, you wanna run away.

1267
01:00:12,570 --> 01:00:14,072
Put it away, Chris.

1268
01:00:14,072 --> 01:00:15,865
- You never really were
one of us, were you?

1269
01:00:15,865 --> 01:00:17,492
- Jesus Christ, Chris.

1270
01:00:17,492 --> 01:00:19,327
- We've had nothing but
trouble since we picked her up.

1271
01:00:19,327 --> 01:00:21,454
- Go ahead, try it.

1272
01:00:21,454 --> 01:00:22,872
Just try it.

1273
01:00:22,872 --> 01:00:25,458
I've had all I can take
of your hard ass bullshit,

1274
01:00:25,458 --> 01:00:27,502
always riding me.

1275
01:00:27,502 --> 01:00:30,964
- All right, both of
you, put it away, now!

1276
01:00:33,091 --> 01:00:33,967
I mean it.

1277
01:00:36,219 --> 01:00:38,346
- Look at you guys, man.

1278
01:00:38,346 --> 01:00:40,223
You're all so scared and mixed up

1279
01:00:40,223 --> 01:00:42,517
you're at each other's throats.

1280
01:00:42,517 --> 01:00:45,770
- I mean, don't you remember
when we felt invincible?

1281
01:00:45,770 --> 01:00:47,272
Because we were United.

1282
01:00:50,150 --> 01:00:52,527
Long ago women had real power.

1283
01:00:53,570 --> 01:00:58,408
We were the elders, the
shaman, the mystics,

1284
01:00:59,784 --> 01:01:02,537
you know, life givers.

1285
01:01:03,413 --> 01:01:04,956
- So what's your point, Jesse?

1286
01:01:04,956 --> 01:01:07,375
- The point is I want us to unite again,

1287
01:01:07,375 --> 01:01:09,878
one more time please, just for Trish.

1288
01:01:09,878 --> 01:01:11,338
- Jesse, it's over.

1289
01:01:11,338 --> 01:01:12,464
- Look, okay.

1290
01:01:12,464 --> 01:01:14,382
Okay, you guys wanna call it quits.

1291
01:01:14,382 --> 01:01:16,426
You wanna end this thing, huh?

1292
01:01:16,426 --> 01:01:18,511
So let's do it in style.

1293
01:01:18,511 --> 01:01:20,764
I say we kill Carl Varna.

1294
01:01:20,764 --> 01:01:21,639
- Yeah.

1295
01:01:21,639 --> 01:01:23,808
Varna, they'll give us a fucking medal.

1296
01:01:23,808 --> 01:01:25,769
- Carl Varna.

1297
01:01:25,769 --> 01:01:28,021
Are you out your minds?

1298
01:01:28,021 --> 01:01:30,231
He's with the mob for Christ's sake.

1299
01:01:30,231 --> 01:01:33,193
He's got armed goons all over the place.

1300
01:01:33,193 --> 01:01:34,569
- Jesse, it's over.

1301
01:01:34,569 --> 01:01:36,321
It's over, Jesse.

1302
01:01:36,321 --> 01:01:37,197
- Fuck you!

1303
01:01:38,365 --> 01:01:39,949
Fuck all of you, man.

1304
01:01:42,077 --> 01:01:43,495
And you, Becky.

1305
01:01:44,537 --> 01:01:46,956
I mean, I thought outta all of 'em,

1306
01:01:46,956 --> 01:01:48,541
that you would've stuck by me,

1307
01:01:50,460 --> 01:01:54,547
but you're just as weak and
pathetic is the rest of them.

1308
01:01:54,547 --> 01:01:57,092
- You're way outta line,
Jesse, way outta line.

1309
01:01:58,927 --> 01:02:01,638
- Get the fuck outta here.

1310
01:02:01,638 --> 01:02:03,223
- Jesse, just cool it.

1311
01:02:03,223 --> 01:02:04,766
- Get the fuck outta here.

1312
01:02:04,766 --> 01:02:06,559
- Wait, Jesse, I'm with (indistinct).

1313
01:02:06,559 --> 01:02:08,812
- Get the fuck outta here!

1314
01:02:10,563 --> 01:02:12,482
- Oh Jesse, please don't do this.

1315
01:02:12,482 --> 01:02:15,068
She's dead to you two times.

1316
01:02:15,068 --> 01:02:20,240
- All of you get the fuck out of here!

1317
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:22,409
(crying)

1318
01:02:24,285 --> 01:02:27,497
(high-tension music)

1319
01:02:39,134 --> 01:02:41,136
- Goodbye honey.

1320
01:02:41,136 --> 01:02:43,054
Take care of yourself.

1321
01:02:47,475 --> 01:02:49,811
- Go on, we don't need you.

1322
01:02:51,146 --> 01:02:52,022
- Careful.

1323
01:03:01,406 --> 01:03:03,575
(crying)

1324
01:03:10,331 --> 01:03:13,209
(dramatic music)

1325
01:03:45,700 --> 01:03:47,160
- Police, freeze!

1326
01:03:50,580 --> 01:03:51,456
Shut up.

1327
01:03:51,456 --> 01:03:54,751
- What the hell are you doing?

1328
01:03:54,751 --> 01:03:56,461
You're making a big mistake, really.

1329
01:03:56,461 --> 01:03:57,712
- No don't bother Allison.

1330
01:03:57,712 --> 01:04:00,674
You know, you got a nice dye job.

1331
01:04:00,674 --> 01:04:02,300
Come on, lets get in the car.

1332
01:04:02,300 --> 01:04:03,134
Come on.

1333
01:04:07,305 --> 01:04:09,474
I saw your file from Steubenville.

1334
01:04:11,685 --> 01:04:13,687
Now he beat you pretty bad, didn't he?

1335
01:04:15,355 --> 01:04:17,440
- What are you gonna do,
send me back to Ohio?

1336
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:18,608
- I don't know.

1337
01:04:18,608 --> 01:04:20,276
You know, maybe I should
let 'em fry you here,

1338
01:04:20,276 --> 01:04:21,820
for killing my partner.

1339
01:04:21,820 --> 01:04:23,405
- What are you talking about?

1340
01:04:23,405 --> 01:04:24,280
- Come on, Allison.

1341
01:04:24,280 --> 01:04:25,740
Now you've done a lot more than waitress,

1342
01:04:25,740 --> 01:04:27,575
since you rolled into town.

1343
01:04:27,575 --> 01:04:28,702
Look, I got you dead to rights.

1344
01:04:28,702 --> 01:04:30,745
I can make sure you'll
never see daylight again.

1345
01:04:30,745 --> 01:04:31,705
- So what's stopping you?

1346
01:04:31,705 --> 01:04:33,498
What do you want from me?

1347
01:04:33,498 --> 01:04:36,835
- I don't want you Allison.
I want your girlfriends.

1348
01:04:36,835 --> 01:04:38,712
- Sorry, I don't know
what you're talking about.

1349
01:04:38,712 --> 01:04:40,338
- Look, don't fuck with me, Allison.

1350
01:04:40,338 --> 01:04:41,548
I will crucify you.

1351
01:04:41,548 --> 01:04:42,549
- I want a lawyer.

1352
01:04:42,549 --> 01:04:43,675
- Fuck the lawyer.

1353
01:04:43,675 --> 01:04:47,554
You listen, you help me
with this, you'll go free.

1354
01:04:47,554 --> 01:04:50,223
- Come on, you really
think I'm that stupid?

1355
01:04:50,223 --> 01:04:52,308
You'd say anything to get what you want.

1356
01:04:52,308 --> 01:04:54,144
- Well, you'll just have to trust me.

1357
01:04:54,144 --> 01:04:55,186
- Right.

1358
01:04:55,186 --> 01:04:57,272
- Allison, you don't have a choice.

1359
01:04:57,272 --> 01:04:58,148
Now, I made you.

1360
01:04:58,148 --> 01:05:01,484
How far do you think you'll
get if you try to run, huh?

1361
01:05:01,484 --> 01:05:02,902
Every cop in this nation

1362
01:05:02,902 --> 01:05:05,155
will be gunning for you, Feds included.

1363
01:05:05,155 --> 01:05:06,906
You'll never make it out of the city.

1364
01:05:06,906 --> 01:05:08,908
- So what am I supposed to do?

1365
01:05:08,908 --> 01:05:10,285
- You go back to your girlfriends,

1366
01:05:10,285 --> 01:05:12,454
and you act like nothing's changed,

1367
01:05:12,454 --> 01:05:15,707
but the minute they make
a move, Allison, any move,

1368
01:05:15,707 --> 01:05:16,666
you let me know.

1369
01:05:17,542 --> 01:05:18,585
You call me.

1370
01:05:19,502 --> 01:05:22,380
I'm gonna give you my
numbers to my mobile phone,

1371
01:05:22,380 --> 01:05:25,550
to reach me at any hour, day or night.

1372
01:05:25,550 --> 01:05:26,968
Now let me see your wrists.

1373
01:05:29,554 --> 01:05:30,430
(Allison yelling)

1374
01:05:30,430 --> 01:05:33,224
Don't even think about crossing me, girl.

1375
01:05:33,224 --> 01:05:35,101
'Cause I'll be watching you.

1376
01:05:35,101 --> 01:05:36,686
You try to bolt and I will nail

1377
01:05:36,686 --> 01:05:38,021
your fucking ass to the wall,

1378
01:05:38,021 --> 01:05:40,190
harder than the rest of them, you hear me?

1379
01:05:40,190 --> 01:05:41,691
I said, do you hear me?

1380
01:05:41,691 --> 01:05:43,568
- Yes, yes, I hear you.

1381
01:05:43,568 --> 01:05:44,444
- Good.

1382
01:05:49,366 --> 01:05:51,409
Go on back to your psycho friends.

1383
01:06:05,340 --> 01:06:07,842
(rock music)

1384
01:06:28,822 --> 01:06:30,240
- Jesse?

1385
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:33,201
I thought I heard someone
down here, what's going on?

1386
01:06:33,201 --> 01:06:35,453
What are you doing
dressed like that, Jess?

1387
01:06:37,622 --> 01:06:38,498
Jess?

1388
01:06:41,292 --> 01:06:42,460
Oh no.

1389
01:06:42,460 --> 01:06:43,795
Now come on, wait Jesse.

1390
01:06:43,795 --> 01:06:46,131
Where the fuck do you
think you're going Jesse?

1391
01:06:46,131 --> 01:06:47,674
Jesse no, don't do this.

1392
01:06:47,674 --> 01:06:49,300
Jesse, don't do this.

1393
01:06:49,300 --> 01:06:52,303
Please Jesse, don't go.

1394
01:06:52,303 --> 01:06:54,889
Jesse!

1395
01:06:54,889 --> 01:06:57,767
(phone ringing)

1396
01:07:01,938 --> 01:07:04,566
- Yeah?

1397
01:07:04,566 --> 01:07:05,734
Whoa, Annie.

1398
01:07:05,734 --> 01:07:08,361
Annie, I don't understand you.

1399
01:07:13,033 --> 01:07:13,867
Jesse?

1400
01:07:15,994 --> 01:07:16,870
Shit.

1401
01:07:18,538 --> 01:07:21,082
(punk music)

1402
01:07:48,651 --> 01:07:52,280
- You have made me very angry, young lady.

1403
01:07:53,907 --> 01:07:55,533
Very angry, indeed.

1404
01:07:58,036 --> 01:07:59,454
You have killed my gunta.

1405
01:07:59,454 --> 01:08:01,206
Do you have any idea how hard it is

1406
01:08:01,206 --> 01:08:02,916
to find a man like that today?

1407
01:08:04,709 --> 01:08:05,794
Who the fuck are you?

1408
01:08:06,711 --> 01:08:08,254
A cop?

1409
01:08:08,254 --> 01:08:09,589
Federal agent, perhaps?

1410
01:08:09,589 --> 01:08:11,299
- She had no ID.

1411
01:08:11,299 --> 01:08:12,467
Wasn't wearing vest.

1412
01:08:14,219 --> 01:08:15,178
- So who sent you?

1413
01:08:16,429 --> 01:08:17,931
Santini?

1414
01:08:17,931 --> 01:08:19,140
The Montrose brothers?

1415
01:08:21,267 --> 01:08:22,769
Answer me!

1416
01:08:24,270 --> 01:08:25,146
- Fuck you.

1417
01:08:27,023 --> 01:08:28,525
- Well,

1418
01:08:28,525 --> 01:08:29,401
it speaks.

1419
01:08:30,944 --> 01:08:34,698
This strange creature seems
to think she's rather tough.

1420
01:08:34,698 --> 01:08:35,699
Doesn't she, Anton?

1421
01:08:44,916 --> 01:08:46,001
Well, if you were a cop,

1422
01:08:46,001 --> 01:08:49,212
your colleagues would come
here by now to your defense.

1423
01:08:50,338 --> 01:08:54,426
But alas, you are all alone

1424
01:08:54,426 --> 01:08:56,386
with me and my boys.

1425
01:08:56,386 --> 01:08:57,595
(man chuckling)

1426
01:08:57,595 --> 01:08:59,222
- [Man] Hey, maybe she's
one of those vigilantes

1427
01:08:59,222 --> 01:09:00,515
we've been hearing about.

1428
01:09:02,017 --> 01:09:03,727
- You are so naive, Anton.

1429
01:09:03,727 --> 01:09:07,355
Those stories are invented
by the media in this country.

1430
01:09:08,732 --> 01:09:10,692
But why don't we ask her all the same?

1431
01:09:13,445 --> 01:09:15,155
Is that how you see yourself,

1432
01:09:16,031 --> 01:09:19,117
as an angry vigilante
with God on your side?

1433
01:09:20,118 --> 01:09:24,330
Some angel of death come to
vanquish the horrible devil.

1434
01:09:25,457 --> 01:09:27,876
(laughing)

1435
01:09:28,835 --> 01:09:32,380
Oh, I am sorry to disappoint you, my dear.

1436
01:09:32,380 --> 01:09:33,840
Don't believe the press.

1437
01:09:34,841 --> 01:09:36,176
I am not a devil.

1438
01:09:37,635 --> 01:09:39,012
I am just a businessman.

1439
01:09:39,888 --> 01:09:41,931
I know what people want,

1440
01:09:41,931 --> 01:09:43,475
and I sell it to them.

1441
01:09:46,311 --> 01:09:50,982
Bring her downstairs, but
keep her alive for the party.

1442
01:09:56,696 --> 01:09:59,824
(voice on intercom)

1443
01:10:34,067 --> 01:10:34,943
- Allison.

1444
01:10:36,861 --> 01:10:38,655
Get in here, Allison.

1445
01:10:41,491 --> 01:10:43,493
What is wrong with you?

1446
01:10:44,369 --> 01:10:47,747
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1447
01:10:47,747 --> 01:10:50,291
Fucking stupid fucking bitch.

1448
01:10:52,002 --> 01:10:53,753
- I'm sorry.

1449
01:10:53,753 --> 01:10:54,671
I'm sorry.

1450
01:10:54,671 --> 01:10:57,632
- What the fuck is wrong with you?

1451
01:11:32,250 --> 01:11:33,960
- [Becky] I thought you were leaving.

1452
01:11:33,960 --> 01:11:36,087
- Annie saw her leave
about four in the morning.

1453
01:11:36,087 --> 01:11:37,255
She had all her gear with her.

1454
01:11:37,255 --> 01:11:38,340
- So what are we gonna do?

1455
01:11:38,340 --> 01:11:39,215
- What do you think?

1456
01:11:39,215 --> 01:11:40,467
We're gonna go get her.

1457
01:11:40,467 --> 01:11:41,509
- Are you with us?

1458
01:11:42,761 --> 01:11:44,179
- Oh, come on, she's worthless, I knew it.

1459
01:11:44,179 --> 01:11:46,264
- Oh shut the fuck up, Chris.

1460
01:11:46,264 --> 01:11:48,892
I'm in, but there's something
I gotta go take care of first.

1461
01:11:48,892 --> 01:11:51,561
- Bullshit, we'll never see her again.

1462
01:11:51,561 --> 01:11:53,813
- Chris, she said she's with us, okay?

1463
01:11:53,813 --> 01:11:56,191
- Okay, Jen, you go and
do what you gotta do.

1464
01:11:56,191 --> 01:11:58,902
If you ain't back by midnight,
we know you ain't showing.

1465
01:11:58,902 --> 01:12:00,070
- I'll be here.

1466
01:12:02,197 --> 01:12:04,032
- Bet you a grand she doesn't show.

1467
01:12:06,201 --> 01:12:07,786
(phone ringing)

1468
01:12:07,786 --> 01:12:09,245
- Son of a bitch.

1469
01:12:10,288 --> 01:12:13,041
(phone ringing)

1470
01:12:13,041 --> 01:12:13,917
Yeah?

1471
01:12:15,335 --> 01:12:16,252
Allison?

1472
01:12:16,252 --> 01:12:18,797
- Meet me under the
Manhattan Bridge in one hour.

1473
01:12:18,797 --> 01:12:21,591
I can't talk right now, just
meet me there in an hour.

1474
01:12:22,550 --> 01:12:23,426
- Wait.

1475
01:12:24,511 --> 01:12:29,724
Shit.

1476
01:12:42,404 --> 01:12:46,741
Allison?

1477
01:12:46,741 --> 01:12:47,617
Allison?

1478
01:12:50,704 --> 01:12:51,579
- Drop the gun.

1479
01:12:51,579 --> 01:12:52,997
- Shit.

1480
01:12:52,997 --> 01:12:53,998
- Drop the gun.

1481
01:12:53,998 --> 01:12:56,042
- What the fuck are you doing, Allison?

1482
01:12:56,042 --> 01:12:58,461
- Shut up.

1483
01:12:58,461 --> 01:12:59,462
Shut up and move.

1484
01:12:59,462 --> 01:13:01,381
- What is this, payback Allison?

1485
01:13:01,381 --> 01:13:02,257
Huh?

1486
01:13:03,299 --> 01:13:05,135
You and the girl's gonna
hit somebody, is that it?

1487
01:13:05,135 --> 01:13:06,219
- Shut the fuck up.

1488
01:13:07,220 --> 01:13:08,304
Shut up.
- What now?

1489
01:13:09,180 --> 01:13:10,432
Shit.

1490
01:13:10,432 --> 01:13:12,100
- Now cuff yourself to that fence.

1491
01:13:12,100 --> 01:13:12,934
Do it.

1492
01:13:13,852 --> 01:13:15,729
Cuff yourself to that fence.

1493
01:13:24,487 --> 01:13:25,488
Now gimme the keys.

1494
01:13:27,782 --> 01:13:28,992
Don't make me shoot you.

1495
01:13:28,992 --> 01:13:31,036
You already pinned one dead cop on me,

1496
01:13:31,036 --> 01:13:32,328
I got nothing to lose.

1497
01:13:40,628 --> 01:13:42,839
- Who's it gonna be
this time, Allison, huh?

1498
01:13:42,839 --> 01:13:44,007
You can't finish the judge.

1499
01:13:44,007 --> 01:13:46,926
He fled to Florida the day
after you tried to waste him.

1500
01:13:46,926 --> 01:13:47,802
Shit.

1501
01:13:49,012 --> 01:13:50,597
Let me think.

1502
01:13:50,597 --> 01:13:53,016
Trials, acquittals.

1503
01:13:53,016 --> 01:13:54,851
It's gotta be somebody in the news.

1504
01:13:54,851 --> 01:13:56,478
Somebody worth the trouble.

1505
01:13:58,104 --> 01:13:59,773
Carl Varna.

1506
01:13:59,773 --> 01:14:02,817
(knocking on door)

1507
01:14:03,818 --> 01:14:06,946
(knocking on door)

1508
01:14:19,668 --> 01:14:21,920
- Well, well, well Chris, look who's here.

1509
01:14:24,506 --> 01:14:25,757
All right guys.

1510
01:14:25,757 --> 01:14:27,300
Enough of this bullshit.

1511
01:14:29,594 --> 01:14:31,680
Let's go get Jesse.

1512
01:14:31,680 --> 01:14:34,057
(drumming)

1513
01:14:57,872 --> 01:14:59,708
- Later, I have a surprise for you.

1514
01:15:00,875 --> 01:15:01,751
Do you want a surprise, darling?

1515
01:15:04,462 --> 01:15:07,549
Tell me you want a surprise.

1516
01:15:07,549 --> 01:15:09,801
(moaning)

1517
01:15:15,765 --> 01:15:16,891
- Look, look.

1518
01:15:18,643 --> 01:15:21,604
That's what happens to naughty girls.

1519
01:15:21,604 --> 01:15:24,983
Some of them are pretty girls like you.

1520
01:15:26,735 --> 01:15:28,319
You're a nice girl.

1521
01:15:28,319 --> 01:15:29,946
They cut you apart.

1522
01:15:31,489 --> 01:15:35,744
(muffled speaking in background)

1523
01:16:00,852 --> 01:16:01,728
- Hi.
- Hi.

1524
01:16:01,728 --> 01:16:05,231
How you doing? Do you have
an invitation or party here?

1525
01:16:05,231 --> 01:16:06,566
- An invitation?

1526
01:16:06,566 --> 01:16:07,859
- Yeah, an invitation.

1527
01:16:07,859 --> 01:16:08,693
- Yeah.

1528
01:16:08,693 --> 01:16:10,236
- Know what an invitation is?

1529
01:16:10,236 --> 01:16:11,613
- Yeah, I know what an invitation is.

1530
01:16:11,613 --> 01:16:14,199
- Look like you know.

1531
01:16:14,199 --> 01:16:17,619
- Here's your fucking invitation.

1532
01:16:17,619 --> 01:16:19,371
- Where's Varna?

1533
01:16:19,371 --> 01:16:21,247
Where are they keeping Jesse?

1534
01:16:21,247 --> 01:16:23,249
- I don't know what the
fuck you're talking about.

1535
01:16:23,249 --> 01:16:24,918
- Listen, we're gonna kill you.

1536
01:16:24,918 --> 01:16:26,711
So why don't you just
tell us where Varna is,

1537
01:16:26,711 --> 01:16:28,672
and I might let you live?

1538
01:16:28,672 --> 01:16:29,798
- All right they're downstairs, man.

1539
01:16:29,798 --> 01:16:32,175
There's a party downstairs.

1540
01:16:32,175 --> 01:16:33,051
- Sucker.

1541
01:16:38,723 --> 01:16:41,768
(traffic overhead)

1542
01:16:50,944 --> 01:16:51,820
- Damn.

1543
01:17:01,830 --> 01:17:04,416
(gun firing)

1544
01:17:22,976 --> 01:17:23,852
- Ladies.

1545
01:17:25,979 --> 01:17:27,105
Nice clothes.

1546
01:17:28,606 --> 01:17:30,942
Where you supposed to be, huh?

1547
01:17:30,942 --> 01:17:31,818
- Death.

1548
01:17:37,449 --> 01:17:39,868
(tires squealing)

1549
01:17:39,868 --> 01:17:40,744
- Police.

1550
01:17:58,053 --> 01:18:00,388
(laughing)

1551
01:18:14,361 --> 01:18:16,613
- I'll rip your fucking balls off.

1552
01:18:17,697 --> 01:18:20,116
(laughing)

1553
01:18:37,092 --> 01:18:39,928
- Carl, is this part of the game?

1554
01:18:39,928 --> 01:18:42,055
- Die motherfucker.

1555
01:18:42,055 --> 01:18:44,641
(guns firing)

1556
01:19:07,497 --> 01:19:08,331
- Come on!

1557
01:19:09,541 --> 01:19:11,584
Let's go here, you fucking dykes.

1558
01:19:11,584 --> 01:19:12,460
Come on.

1559
01:19:13,712 --> 01:19:16,214
(gun firing)

1560
01:19:17,716 --> 01:19:21,261
(guns firing)

1561
01:19:21,261 --> 01:19:24,472
- You promised me total security, Carl.

1562
01:19:24,472 --> 01:19:25,682
You promised me that.

1563
01:19:25,682 --> 01:19:28,226
(gun firing)

1564
01:19:30,020 --> 01:19:31,438
(gun firing)

1565
01:19:31,438 --> 01:19:32,313
- Becky!

1566
01:19:49,247 --> 01:19:51,875
(guns firing)

1567
01:19:53,710 --> 01:19:56,338
(guns firing)

1568
01:20:02,469 --> 01:20:04,929
(screaming)

1569
01:20:12,771 --> 01:20:15,982
(somber organ music)

1570
01:20:23,823 --> 01:20:24,657
- Jesse?

1571
01:20:26,201 --> 01:20:28,870
(gun clicking)

1572
01:20:32,374 --> 01:20:33,875
- No please.

1573
01:20:33,875 --> 01:20:36,586
Please don't don't don't.

1574
01:20:36,586 --> 01:20:38,296
Let me go. Let me go.

1575
01:20:38,296 --> 01:20:39,589
I can give you money.

1576
01:20:39,589 --> 01:20:41,800
I can give you millions.

1577
01:20:41,800 --> 01:20:42,926
Millions, I can give you millions.

1578
01:20:42,926 --> 01:20:44,219
Please don't kill me.

1579
01:20:46,262 --> 01:20:49,307
(heavy rock music)

1580
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:19,129
(crying)

1581
01:21:27,512 --> 01:21:30,098
- Freeze.

1582
01:21:30,098 --> 01:21:34,227
Put the gun down, put the down now.

1583
01:21:40,775 --> 01:21:41,651
- No way.

1584
01:21:42,819 --> 01:21:44,070
(gun firing)

1585
01:21:44,070 --> 01:21:45,030
- Ow, shit!

1586
01:21:47,198 --> 01:21:49,576
Put the gun down, put it down.

1587
01:21:51,244 --> 01:21:53,538
- So what are you gonna do, kill us both?

1588
01:21:53,538 --> 01:21:56,207
You'd never make it, and you know it.

1589
01:21:56,207 --> 01:21:57,751
Just let us go.

1590
01:21:57,751 --> 01:21:59,127
All the bad guys are dead.

1591
01:21:59,127 --> 01:22:00,670
They'll make you a big hero.

1592
01:22:00,670 --> 01:22:02,464
- What about you Allison, huh?

1593
01:22:02,464 --> 01:22:05,884
Justify killing my partner,
you justify that shit.

1594
01:22:05,884 --> 01:22:06,718
- I'm sorry.

1595
01:22:06,718 --> 01:22:08,970
We never meant to kill cops,

1596
01:22:08,970 --> 01:22:11,765
but it happened and there's
nothing we can do about it, now.

1597
01:22:11,765 --> 01:22:12,724
- I'm gonna waste her, Jen.

1598
01:22:12,724 --> 01:22:13,600
I'm gonna do it.

1599
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:15,852
- You're gonna kill me
and have her kill you,

1600
01:22:15,852 --> 01:22:16,728
or are you gonna be smart?

1601
01:22:16,728 --> 01:22:18,646
Use your head, let us go, come on.

1602
01:22:18,646 --> 01:22:20,648
What's it gonna be?

1603
01:22:20,648 --> 01:22:21,524
- Can't trust her.

1604
01:22:21,524 --> 01:22:23,068
- No Chris, don't.

1605
01:22:23,068 --> 01:22:24,361
Chris, it's gonna be okay.

1606
01:22:24,361 --> 01:22:27,739
She's gonna let us go, right cop?

1607
01:22:32,410 --> 01:22:35,205
You gonna put me away for
killing my maniac husband?

1608
01:22:35,205 --> 01:22:37,582
Or a sick fuck, like Carl Varna?

1609
01:22:37,582 --> 01:22:40,543
Come on cop, you know what he's done.

1610
01:22:40,543 --> 01:22:41,711
Tell me there's not a side of you

1611
01:22:41,711 --> 01:22:42,712
that would've liked to join us.

1612
01:22:42,712 --> 01:22:43,880
Come on, tell me that.

1613
01:22:50,637 --> 01:22:52,180
You've got no choice.

1614
01:22:57,268 --> 01:22:58,144
- Yeah.

1615
01:23:01,898 --> 01:23:03,983
Go before it's too late.

1616
01:23:21,251 --> 01:23:23,169
You just stay the fuck outta my city.

1617
01:23:24,879 --> 01:23:27,465
(tense music)

1618
01:23:36,975 --> 01:23:39,853
(sirens blaring)

1619
01:23:54,492 --> 01:23:55,452
- Welcome, come in.

1620
01:24:10,759 --> 01:24:11,885
- Hello, Ma.

1621
01:24:15,889 --> 01:24:17,265
Pretty lady,

1622
01:24:17,265 --> 01:24:18,433
just keep them coming.

1623
01:24:19,351 --> 01:24:21,561
- Hey, aren't you that lady cop?

1624
01:24:21,561 --> 01:24:23,813
The one that stops all those murders?

1625
01:24:23,813 --> 01:24:25,273
- Yeah.

1626
01:24:25,273 --> 01:24:27,150
- I saw you on TV.

1627
01:24:27,150 --> 01:24:28,902
Oh, that was some story.

1628
01:24:30,153 --> 01:24:31,946
Didn't you get shot of something?

1629
01:24:31,946 --> 01:24:33,740
- Yeah, I did, but it's getting better.

1630
01:24:33,740 --> 01:24:35,158
Thanks.

1631
01:24:35,158 --> 01:24:36,409
- Well, all right girl.

1632
01:24:36,409 --> 01:24:37,285
All right.

1633
01:24:38,536 --> 01:24:40,830
- I like her, I see you like her too, huh?

1634
01:24:40,830 --> 01:24:42,916
- I like her a lot.

1635
01:24:42,916 --> 01:24:43,750
You know she's right.

1636
01:24:43,750 --> 01:24:44,793
- What?

1637
01:24:44,793 --> 01:24:46,294
- That was some story.

1638
01:24:46,294 --> 01:24:47,545
- Come on Lou, don't start that now,

1639
01:24:47,545 --> 01:24:48,713
we're having a good time.

1640
01:24:48,713 --> 01:24:49,798
Let's just do it.

1641
01:24:49,798 --> 01:24:52,175
- Billie, Billie, Billie, you know me.

1642
01:24:52,175 --> 01:24:55,345
I'm never gonna put this
to bed till you come clean.

1643
01:24:55,345 --> 01:24:57,430
- Lou, let it go.

1644
01:24:57,430 --> 01:25:00,141
- Hey, I got you promoted, right?

1645
01:25:00,141 --> 01:25:02,185
That dog and pony show with the Maisels,

1646
01:25:02,185 --> 01:25:04,604
I handled that for you, right?

1647
01:25:04,604 --> 01:25:05,480
Huh?

1648
01:25:05,480 --> 01:25:07,440
So indulge me for a minute.

1649
01:25:07,440 --> 01:25:09,317
I know you heard all of this before.

1650
01:25:11,277 --> 01:25:12,946
I got a street guy.

1651
01:25:12,946 --> 01:25:15,240
He says he saw two people
come out of Varna's pad

1652
01:25:15,240 --> 01:25:17,283
right before the uniforms show up.

1653
01:25:17,283 --> 01:25:19,202
To back that mud up,

1654
01:25:19,202 --> 01:25:20,787
I get a fresh trail of blood,

1655
01:25:20,787 --> 01:25:23,289
runs out the building and
halfway up the street.

1656
01:25:23,289 --> 01:25:25,083
Billie, I even had the forensic guys

1657
01:25:25,083 --> 01:25:26,793
do DNA tests on the blood.

1658
01:25:26,793 --> 01:25:27,669
You know what they give me?

1659
01:25:27,669 --> 01:25:28,586
Huh?

1660
01:25:28,586 --> 01:25:30,839
A negative with every stiff in that pad.

1661
01:25:30,839 --> 01:25:34,009
Now, you're a detective, Detective.

1662
01:25:34,009 --> 01:25:35,593
Where'd the blood come from?

1663
01:25:35,593 --> 01:25:37,220
- Lou, what do you want from me, huh?

1664
01:25:37,220 --> 01:25:38,722
What the hell do you want from me?

1665
01:25:38,722 --> 01:25:41,349
Now, I gave your report, you
signed it, you sent it up.

1666
01:25:41,349 --> 01:25:42,225
What do you want?

1667
01:25:42,225 --> 01:25:43,351
- No, you know I signed the report.

1668
01:25:43,351 --> 01:25:45,311
I'll back you up on that.

1669
01:25:45,311 --> 01:25:47,188
I want you to tell me the truth.

1670
01:25:47,188 --> 01:25:48,606
Just tell me the truth, okay?

1671
01:25:48,606 --> 01:25:50,900
It's me and you, we're having
a couple drinks together.

1672
01:25:50,900 --> 01:25:52,485
- You want the truth?

1673
01:25:52,485 --> 01:25:53,778
- This ain't Internal Affairs.

1674
01:25:53,778 --> 01:25:54,779
Tell me the truth.

1675
01:25:54,779 --> 01:25:57,407
- The truth is, it's over.

1676
01:25:57,407 --> 01:25:58,992
There's nothing else to say, Lou.

1677
01:25:58,992 --> 01:25:59,909
It's over.

1678
01:26:08,168 --> 01:26:10,837
(men mumbling)

1679
01:26:14,674 --> 01:26:16,926
- Say Sally.

1680
01:26:16,926 --> 01:26:18,762
Say Sally, the hips or the lips.

1681
01:26:19,763 --> 01:26:22,098
(laughing)

1682
01:26:25,727 --> 01:26:29,814
(country music on the jukebox)

1683
01:26:36,613 --> 01:26:38,615
- [Sally] Can I get you anything?

1684
01:26:38,615 --> 01:26:40,075
- Two coffees, black.

1685
01:26:46,623 --> 01:26:49,250
- You watch man, I'm gonna
get me a bitch tonight.

1686
01:26:53,463 --> 01:26:54,964
Come on man, are you scared?

1687
01:27:08,186 --> 01:27:09,604
Hey there ladies.

1688
01:27:09,604 --> 01:27:11,106
How are y'all doing tonight?

1689
01:27:11,106 --> 01:27:12,357
- Evening ladies.

1690
01:27:15,193 --> 01:27:18,321
- Y'all ain't from
around here now, are you?

1691
01:27:18,321 --> 01:27:20,407
- Well, when you're through eating,

1692
01:27:20,407 --> 01:27:21,616
what do you say we take you out

1693
01:27:21,616 --> 01:27:24,077
and show you some of the sites, huh?

1694
01:27:24,077 --> 01:27:27,122
- Grab a couple of beers,
make a night of it?

1695
01:27:27,122 --> 01:27:28,832
- Why don't you go fuck yourself?

1696
01:27:28,832 --> 01:27:29,666
- [Man] Put him out.

1697
01:27:29,666 --> 01:27:31,292
- Well, excuse me, miss?

1698
01:27:31,292 --> 01:27:32,168
- What a bitch.

1699
01:27:32,168 --> 01:27:34,295
She sure ain't friendly, huh Clyde?

1700
01:27:34,295 --> 01:27:35,714
- Strike one.
- Oh yeah.

1701
01:27:36,965 --> 01:27:39,509
- What are y'all, a
couple of fuckin' Lesbos?

1702
01:27:39,509 --> 01:27:41,177
- Leave 'em alone, Clyde.

1703
01:27:41,177 --> 01:27:42,721
- Shut your mouth, Sally.

1704
01:27:42,721 --> 01:27:45,849
Unless you want me to have
another talk with your old man?

1705
01:27:45,849 --> 01:27:46,725
- We'll do it.

1706
01:27:46,725 --> 01:27:47,851
Now go on, get.

1707
01:27:49,686 --> 01:27:52,605
(laughing)

1708
01:27:52,605 --> 01:27:53,982
- What are you laughing at?

1709
01:27:55,984 --> 01:27:57,485
- Fuck them man.

1710
01:27:57,485 --> 01:27:59,612
Only one way to handle this kind of bitch.

1711
01:27:59,612 --> 01:28:00,864
- How's that, huh?

1712
01:28:00,864 --> 01:28:03,366
- Drag their fuckin' dyke asses out back,

1713
01:28:03,366 --> 01:28:04,826
and fuck their goddamn brains out.

1714
01:28:04,826 --> 01:28:05,827
- Hell yes.

1715
01:28:05,827 --> 01:28:09,956
What are you too smart-ass
bitches think of that, huh?

1716
01:28:09,956 --> 01:28:11,708
- Man's talking to ya.

1717
01:28:11,708 --> 01:28:12,751
- Well?

1718
01:28:12,751 --> 01:28:13,752
- Answer him.

1719
01:28:20,550 --> 01:28:23,094
(rock music)

1720
01:28:33,438 --> 01:28:36,399
(lyrics muffled)
