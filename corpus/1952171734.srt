2
00:00:18,953 --> 00:00:20,454
I'm right here,
Marisol.

3
00:00:21,587 --> 00:00:22,920
Right next to you.

4
00:00:24,254 --> 00:00:26,187
Don't ever leave me.

5
00:00:26,254 --> 00:00:27,287
Never.

6
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:45,047
CAINE:
What happened?
A car's
blocking the way.

7
00:00:46,714 --> 00:00:47,948
They're not moving.
I don't understand.

8
00:00:50,581 --> 00:00:51,581
They're here for me.

9
00:00:52,747 --> 00:00:53,814
I'm getting out.

10
00:00:53,881 --> 00:00:56,214
Sweetheart, I have
to get out here.

11
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,514
They'll take you
to the hospital,

12
00:00:57,581 --> 00:00:59,013
but I'll meet you
there, all right?

13
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,948
You hang in there.

14
00:01:10,214 --> 00:01:11,781
We can spend
a weekend in the country.

15
00:01:11,848 --> 00:01:12,881
It'll be great.

16
00:01:15,247 --> 00:01:18,781
So are you happy with
your new husband?

17
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:20,414
Yeah.

18
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:26,080
Marisol, there's something
I have to tell you.

19
00:01:27,948 --> 00:01:29,080
This officer will be

20
00:01:29,147 --> 00:01:30,848
escorting you
until the trial is over.

21
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:34,814
I don't understand.

22
00:01:34,881 --> 00:01:37,180
These are very, very
dangerous people.

23
00:01:37,247 --> 00:01:38,814
Anyone connected
to this case

24
00:01:38,881 --> 00:01:42,047
must have police protection,
including families.

25
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,414
So this is what
remission feels like.

26
00:01:45,481 --> 00:01:48,881
I need to remind you that you
fought and you won, didn't you?

27
00:01:48,948 --> 00:01:51,647
Yeah.

28
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:54,814
Listen, tonight
I was thinking...

29
00:01:55,581 --> 00:01:56,447
Casa... Tua?

30
00:01:56,514 --> 00:01:58,214
Casa Tua. Sounds good.

31
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,681
Are you up?

32
00:01:59,747 --> 00:02:01,814
I'm up.

33
00:02:05,481 --> 00:02:06,481
See you later?

34
00:02:06,547 --> 00:02:07,747
I'll see you tonight.

35
00:02:07,814 --> 00:02:09,280
Love you.

36
00:02:09,347 --> 00:02:11,047
I love you.

37
00:02:11,113 --> 00:02:13,080
You, uh...

38
00:02:13,147 --> 00:02:15,013
You don't let her out
of your sight, right?

39
00:02:16,447 --> 00:02:19,347
CSI Wolfe, what exactly
is your role in this case?

40
00:02:19,414 --> 00:02:20,481
I processed

41
00:02:20,547 --> 00:02:22,047
the firearm evidence
on the day

42
00:02:22,113 --> 00:02:23,948
the Mala Noches
were apprehended.

43
00:02:24,013 --> 00:02:26,414
Can you confirm that
this was the weapon

44
00:02:26,481 --> 00:02:28,314
seized from the defendant
Raphael Sifuentes

45
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:30,280
on the afternoon of the
shootout at the Quarry?

46
00:02:31,347 --> 00:02:32,280
Get on the ground!

47
00:02:32,347 --> 00:02:33,380
Get on the ground! Now!

48
00:02:35,347 --> 00:02:36,781
Move! Move! Move!

49
00:02:36,848 --> 00:02:38,914
So, Raphael,

50
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:40,781
you and your buddies
shot up the cemetery

51
00:02:40,848 --> 00:02:43,380
and then broke
into the Livingston house.

52
00:02:43,447 --> 00:02:45,848
You got some
good story there, B.

53
00:02:47,447 --> 00:02:48,614
Yes.

54
00:02:48,681 --> 00:02:49,881
I can.

55
00:02:49,948 --> 00:02:51,547
Thank you.

56
00:02:51,614 --> 00:02:54,447
The Prosecution
calls Antonio Riaz.

57
00:02:54,514 --> 00:02:56,481
BAILIFF:
Do you swear to tell
the truth, the whole truth...

58
00:02:56,547 --> 00:02:58,980
<i>You're a Mala Noche member,</i>

59
00:02:59,047 --> 00:03:00,013
correct, Mr. Riaz?

60
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,747
Yeah.
And yet,

61
00:03:01,814 --> 00:03:02,781
you're testifying
against them.

62
00:03:02,848 --> 00:03:03,781
Couldn't that
get you killed?

63
00:03:03,848 --> 00:03:05,681
I need to do the right thing.

64
00:03:05,747 --> 00:03:08,980
Is this the gun you
gave to Mr. Sifuentes?

65
00:03:09,047 --> 00:03:10,347
You're a dead man, Riaz!

66
00:03:10,414 --> 00:03:12,180
You hear me? A dead man!

67
00:03:16,681 --> 00:03:19,113
I ask you again.

68
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:21,314
Is this the gun?

69
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:25,314
I-I-I'm not sure.

70
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:27,948
You're saying
this isn't the gun?

71
00:03:28,047 --> 00:03:32,013
No, I-I don't think it is.

72
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,447
But you stated to detectives
that it was, Mr. Riaz.

73
00:03:35,514 --> 00:03:37,347
Can-Can I see it again?

74
00:03:37,414 --> 00:03:38,914
Maybe, maybe
I didn't see it right.

75
00:03:53,214 --> 00:03:54,047
Head's up!

76
00:04:02,914 --> 00:04:04,881
Security 911! Bailiff!

77
00:04:06,414 --> 00:04:08,280
Code 73. Security,
Courtroom 12, stat.

78
00:04:26,047 --> 00:04:28,547
Lieutenant Caine.

79
00:04:28,614 --> 00:04:31,747
You help me and I'll help you.

80
00:04:31,814 --> 00:04:33,380
You're already dead, brother.

81
00:04:36,848 --> 00:04:39,080
Join the club.

82

Cync by xxy
www.1000fr.com

83
00:05:29,994 --> 00:05:31,294
How many people were killed?

84
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,661
Were any of the assailants
foreign nationals?

85
00:05:32,727 --> 00:05:35,028
What sort of leads
do you have in this case?

86
00:05:35,093 --> 00:05:37,127
<i>Has the bailiff's family</i>
<i>been notified?</i>

87
00:05:37,193 --> 00:05:38,794
Horatio.

88
00:05:38,861 --> 00:05:40,193
The fugitives are

89
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:42,894
Raphael Sifuentes
and Antonio Riaz,

90
00:05:42,961 --> 00:05:44,794
both Noches,
both dangerous.

91
00:05:44,861 --> 00:05:45,794
Who's the shooter?

92
00:05:45,861 --> 00:05:47,028
Jose Torillo,

93
00:05:47,093 --> 00:05:48,494
farther down
the Noche food chain.

94
00:05:48,561 --> 00:05:51,160
Frank, it looks like
the witness faked testimony

95
00:05:51,227 --> 00:05:52,794
to get close to the gun.

96
00:05:52,861 --> 00:05:54,494
We put out a BOLO
on the escape vehicle.

97
00:05:54,561 --> 00:05:55,494
We're blanketing the city.

98
00:05:55,561 --> 00:05:57,827
We've gotta find them.

99
00:06:10,494 --> 00:06:11,694
Great.

100
00:06:16,527 --> 00:06:17,894
Eric.

101
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:20,193
Your girlfriend just
broke my window.

102
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:21,527
Hey, hey, slow down.
What girlfriend?

103
00:06:21,594 --> 00:06:22,594
What window?

104
00:06:22,661 --> 00:06:24,060
My car window.
Gloria broke it.

105
00:06:24,127 --> 00:06:26,193
You're sure it was Gloria?
Who else?

106
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,294
She called me the entire
time we were seeing each other.

107
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,761
She's, like,
the hang-up queen.

108
00:06:29,827 --> 00:06:31,327
Somebody might want to tell
her about caller ID..

109
00:06:31,394 --> 00:06:32,861
All right, look.
I'm gonna call her

110
00:06:32,928 --> 00:06:34,193
and tell her to back off.

111
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:36,227
Well, I dealt with this
when we were together.

112
00:06:36,294 --> 00:06:37,861
But now? I mean, seriously,

113
00:06:37,928 --> 00:06:40,260
I don't even know how you
put up with somebody so crazy.

114
00:06:40,327 --> 00:06:41,727
I've told you, I didn't.

115
00:06:41,794 --> 00:06:43,327
I went out with her
a few times.

116
00:06:43,394 --> 00:06:44,761
She's crazy, I moved on.

117
00:06:44,827 --> 00:06:46,360
Well, somebody didn't
give her that message

118
00:06:46,427 --> 00:06:48,093
and now she owes
me a window.

119
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,527
I said I will take care of it.

120
00:06:49,594 --> 00:06:51,894
Yeah, I mean, you better.

121
00:06:57,694 --> 00:06:59,360
All right,
well we know

122
00:06:59,427 --> 00:07:01,294
how the gun
got in here,

123
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,594
but evidence is cleared
before it's stored.

124
00:07:03,661 --> 00:07:06,894
So I guess the question is
how'd the bullets get in here?

125
00:07:06,961 --> 00:07:09,127
SWAT checked the courtroom,
didn't they?

126
00:07:09,193 --> 00:07:10,594
Yeah, it was swept
immediately before

127
00:07:10,661 --> 00:07:12,060
the trial started--
everything was clean.

128
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:13,928
Well, it got dirty.

129
00:07:13,994 --> 00:07:14,994
Where was the shooter sitting?

130
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,160
Over there.

131
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:25,761
Packing tape.

132
00:07:25,827 --> 00:07:28,794
A loaded magazine was
taped under there.

133
00:07:28,861 --> 00:07:31,093
Our shooter knew exactly
where to find it.

134
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:34,527
BAILIFF:
<i>Do you swear to tell the truth,</i>
<i>the whole truth,</i>

135
00:07:34,594 --> 00:07:37,928
<i>and nothing but the truth</i>
<i>so help you God?</i>

136
00:07:39,227 --> 00:07:41,627
But who put it there
for him to find?

137
00:07:41,694 --> 00:07:43,594
Someone on the inside.

138
00:07:44,761 --> 00:07:45,928
Let me see the tape,

139
00:07:45,994 --> 00:07:48,260
I'll have Delko
check it for prints.

140
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,260
Got something?

141
00:08:23,327 --> 00:08:24,661
Yeah.

142
00:08:24,727 --> 00:08:26,861
Let's hope it leads
to something else.

143
00:08:26,928 --> 00:08:29,227
I heard you're
having girl trouble.

144
00:08:29,294 --> 00:08:32,060
Everyone hears everything
in this place?

145
00:08:32,127 --> 00:08:34,594
Yeah. Still, is
the rumor true?

146
00:08:36,627 --> 00:08:38,193
You remember Gloria?

147
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:42,160
Oh, the crazy one.

148
00:08:42,227 --> 00:08:43,861
She was into Raike massage.

149
00:08:43,928 --> 00:08:45,527
Uh-huh, and skydiving.

150
00:08:45,594 --> 00:08:47,127
And hunting if I recall.

151
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:48,561
That's quite
a potent combination.

152
00:08:48,627 --> 00:08:50,093
Yeah, well it didn't
hurt that she looked

153
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,327
the way she did, either.

154
00:08:51,394 --> 00:08:52,794
Yeah, well,
see that's the problem.

155
00:08:52,861 --> 00:08:55,360
You love crazy
until crazy loves you.

156
00:08:55,427 --> 00:08:57,861
Well, crazy has messed with

157
00:08:57,928 --> 00:08:59,394
every girl
I've been with since.

158
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:02,060
And I think she just
busted up Boa Vista's car.

159
00:09:02,127 --> 00:09:03,994
So I've got to put a stop to it.

160
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:08,494
My advice: talk to her
once as Eric Delko.

161
00:09:08,561 --> 00:09:10,093
And then?

162
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,761
Talk to her again as a cop.

163
00:09:12,894 --> 00:09:14,594
I like you,
you're ruthless.

164
00:09:15,894 --> 00:09:17,394
Take a look.

165
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:19,594
It's from the courthouse
employees' database.

166
00:09:20,794 --> 00:09:22,727
DUQUESNE:
Alan Parker,

167
00:09:22,794 --> 00:09:24,360
the janitor at the courthouse.

168
00:09:24,427 --> 00:09:26,093
That's their inside man.

169
00:09:28,727 --> 00:09:30,928
You have to understand, okay.

170
00:09:30,994 --> 00:09:32,260
They threatened me.

171
00:09:32,327 --> 00:09:33,928
DUQUESNE:
A bailiff was was killed

172
00:09:33,994 --> 00:09:35,394
as a result of your actions.

173
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:36,761
And that's so far;
there's still

174
00:09:36,827 --> 00:09:37,961
two dangerous
killers out there.

175
00:09:38,028 --> 00:09:39,694
They knew my daughters' names.

176
00:09:39,761 --> 00:09:41,260
Their schools, their friends.

177
00:09:41,327 --> 00:09:43,360
They said I'd never
see them again.

178
00:09:43,427 --> 00:09:44,794
So you cooperated.

179
00:09:44,861 --> 00:09:46,527
I had to.

180
00:09:46,594 --> 00:09:49,961
Look, all right, I'm sorry
that people got hurt.

181
00:09:50,028 --> 00:09:51,861
But I still have
a family, okay?

182
00:09:51,928 --> 00:09:53,227
I kept them safe.

183
00:09:53,294 --> 00:09:54,627
Who approached you?

184
00:09:54,694 --> 00:09:56,894
Some guy,
some Latino guy.

185
00:09:58,694 --> 00:10:00,794
Was it this guy?

186
00:10:00,861 --> 00:10:03,193
Um, yeah. Yeah, that's the guy.

187
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:06,127
It's Truillo. It's a dead end.

188
00:10:06,193 --> 00:10:07,994
CALLEIGH:
How'd you get
into the courthouse

189
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:09,827
after SWAT swept and secured it?

190
00:10:09,894 --> 00:10:11,994
About five minutes
into the trial,

191
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:13,561
one of the gallery members
got sick.

192
00:10:13,627 --> 00:10:16,761
So they cleared the court
while I cleaned it.

193
00:10:16,827 --> 00:10:19,661
JUDGE:
<i>Ten minute recess;</i>
<i>jurors are to remain</i>

194
00:10:19,727 --> 00:10:21,360
<i>in the break area</i>
<i>pending notification.</i>

195
00:10:30,127 --> 00:10:32,028
Five minutes in,
that's not a coincidence.

196
00:10:32,093 --> 00:10:34,227
Do you still have
what you cleaned up?

197
00:10:34,294 --> 00:10:35,794
Um, yeah.

198
00:10:35,861 --> 00:10:38,127
I mean, it's-it's still
in the janitor's closet.

199
00:10:38,193 --> 00:10:40,694
Could help us find another
piece of the puzzle.

200
00:10:40,761 --> 00:10:42,794
You're gonna make me
collect that, aren't you?

201
00:10:42,861 --> 00:10:44,093
Mm-hmm.

202
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,827
Rank has its privileges.

203
00:10:47,861 --> 00:10:49,661
I came as soon as you called.

204
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:51,028
Gloria,

205
00:10:51,093 --> 00:10:52,994
if you're going to call
and bother people, okay,

206
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:54,627
I'd appreciate it
if you just called me.

207
00:10:54,694 --> 00:10:56,193
You miss me?

208
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:58,727
No, I don't.

209
00:10:58,794 --> 00:11:00,727
Well, that's good.

210
00:11:00,794 --> 00:11:02,327
'Cause what would
your wife think?

211
00:11:02,394 --> 00:11:03,394
My wife?

212
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:04,627
What are you
talking about?

213
00:11:04,694 --> 00:11:06,594
Oh, that's sweet.

214
00:11:06,661 --> 00:11:09,093
It still feels weird
to say it, huh?

215
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,294
Wife.

216
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,527
What, are you crazy?

217
00:11:11,594 --> 00:11:12,994
You see a ring on my finger?

218
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:17,527
Guy like you won't wear a ring.

219
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:19,994
Or maybe he
doesn't want to.

220
00:11:21,527 --> 00:11:24,160
I saw you at the courthouse.

221
00:11:24,227 --> 00:11:25,427
You've been following me?

222
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:29,060
Well, I got news for you:
that was my sister.

223
00:11:29,127 --> 00:11:30,394
She got married.

224
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:32,227
You told me
you didn't have siblings.

225
00:11:32,294 --> 00:11:34,160
I didn't tell you
a lot of things, Gloria.

226
00:11:34,227 --> 00:11:36,894
You know why? Because with you,
information is dangerous.

227
00:11:36,961 --> 00:11:40,627
With me, a lot of things
are dangerous.

228
00:11:40,694 --> 00:11:43,227
You come near me
or anyone that I know,

229
00:11:43,294 --> 00:11:44,861
and I'm going to arrest you.

230
00:11:44,928 --> 00:11:50,427
Mm...

231
00:11:57,961 --> 00:12:01,227
So, guess what I found
in my pile of puke.

232
00:12:01,294 --> 00:12:02,394
Do I have to?

233
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:03,928
Coal.

234
00:12:03,994 --> 00:12:05,427
And...?

235
00:12:05,494 --> 00:12:06,561
And it's the active
ingredient in ipecac.

236
00:12:06,627 --> 00:12:08,360
Ipecac.
Induces vomiting.

237
00:12:08,427 --> 00:12:09,694
It also confirms

238
00:12:09,761 --> 00:12:11,694
that our puker was in on
the courthouse shootout.

239
00:12:11,761 --> 00:12:14,227
It was a diversionary tactic.

240
00:12:14,294 --> 00:12:15,861
So this, my friend, is for you.

241
00:12:15,928 --> 00:12:17,661
A vial of bile.

242
00:12:17,727 --> 00:12:18,928
You're too good to me.

243
00:12:18,994 --> 00:12:21,093
The force of vomit
scrapes the esophagus,

244
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:24,127
taking bits of the puker's skin
along with his stomach content.

245
00:12:24,193 --> 00:12:26,060
I'll let you know
if I find a conspirator.

246
00:12:26,127 --> 00:12:27,327
Thank you.

247
00:13:03,193 --> 00:13:05,093
What?

248
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,761
So you're the upchuck
specialist.

249
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:09,060
Didn't think we'd find
you, did you, Benito?

250
00:13:09,127 --> 00:13:10,661
Didn't know you guys
were looking.

251
00:13:10,727 --> 00:13:12,494
You were at the courthouse
today, weren't you, Benito,

252
00:13:12,561 --> 00:13:14,694
helping bust out Sifuentes?

253
00:13:17,494 --> 00:13:19,394
Clear the court.
Ten minute recess.

254
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:21,561
I'm happy to have the rep.
Yeah, well,
you're not

255
00:13:21,627 --> 00:13:23,160
gonna be too happy
where you're headed.

256
00:13:23,227 --> 00:13:25,827
So you want me to snitch, huh?

257
00:13:25,894 --> 00:13:27,327
Like Antonio Riaz?

258
00:13:27,394 --> 00:13:28,627
Where is he Benito?

259
00:13:28,694 --> 00:13:30,160
And Raphael Sifuentes?

260
00:13:30,227 --> 00:13:32,127
Hey, you'll never find them.

261
00:13:32,193 --> 00:13:33,894
So that tells me
one thing, Benito.
What?

262
00:13:33,961 --> 00:13:35,093
You know where they are.

263
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,527
So where are they?

264
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,994
Not saying.

265
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:43,127
Well, then let me tell you
where you'll find yourself--

266
00:13:43,193 --> 00:13:45,794
in lockup, tagged with a rep
as a snitch.

267
00:13:45,861 --> 00:13:46,961
What?

268
00:13:47,028 --> 00:13:48,028
But I didn't say nothing.

269
00:13:48,093 --> 00:13:49,527
Not yet.

270
00:13:50,827 --> 00:13:54,028
I assume you can write.

271
00:13:57,827 --> 00:13:58,827
Let's go.

272
00:14:12,127 --> 00:14:14,394
TRIPP:
Japanese restaurant?

273
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:16,060
That's a good front.

274
00:14:16,127 --> 00:14:18,093
Outside of Noche territory.

275
00:14:52,754 --> 00:14:55,054
Eric.
I-I-I can't find him.

276
00:14:55,121 --> 00:14:56,353
I can't find Horatio anywhere.

277
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:57,854
Mari, Mari, listen, slow down.

278
00:14:57,921 --> 00:14:58,987
Slow down, okay?

279
00:14:59,054 --> 00:15:00,320
I need to get a hold of him.

280
00:15:00,387 --> 00:15:01,587
What happened?

281
00:15:01,654 --> 00:15:02,587
Somebody vandalized my car.

282
00:15:02,654 --> 00:15:04,320
They, um, they stole my purse.

283
00:15:04,387 --> 00:15:06,587
I just ran into the store
for a second.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

284
00:15:06,654 --> 00:15:08,021
Vandalized how?

285
00:15:08,087 --> 00:15:09,620
They broke my window.

286
00:15:09,687 --> 00:15:11,987
Do you think they're trying
to send Horatio a message?

287
00:15:12,054 --> 00:15:14,487
No. No, this has nothing
to do with him.

288
00:15:14,554 --> 00:15:15,720
It has to do with me.

289
00:15:15,787 --> 00:15:17,188
You?

290
00:15:17,254 --> 00:15:18,754
Yeah, it's personal.

291
00:15:18,821 --> 00:15:19,954
I'll explain later.

292
00:15:20,021 --> 00:15:22,188
I want you to take
your car to the shop

293
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:24,288
and I'll call you
when I get your purse.

294
00:15:24,353 --> 00:15:26,188
Yeah. Okay.

295
00:15:26,254 --> 00:15:27,487
Thanks, little brother.

296
00:15:27,554 --> 00:15:29,021
Sorry.

297
00:15:38,387 --> 00:15:41,054
Gloria.
Eric.

298
00:15:41,121 --> 00:15:43,154
Two visits in one day.

299
00:15:43,221 --> 00:15:44,587
I never understood, Gloria.

300
00:15:44,654 --> 00:15:47,921
You got all of this,
and you still want to harass me?

301
00:15:47,987 --> 00:15:50,687
Money can't
buy you love.
I warned you.

302
00:15:50,754 --> 00:15:54,520
Guess we're both spending
the day warning people, huh?

303
00:15:54,587 --> 00:15:57,188
No, you're threatening people,
innocent people.

304
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:00,554
Now, where is Marisol's purse?

305
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:01,887
Oh.

306
00:16:01,954 --> 00:16:03,154
You're here for
your wife's stuff?

307
00:16:03,221 --> 00:16:05,254
I told you,
she's not my wife.

308
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,520
Then I don't
have her stuff.

309
00:16:06,587 --> 00:16:07,887
She's my sister.

310
00:16:07,954 --> 00:16:09,221
All right?

311
00:16:09,288 --> 00:16:11,387
Look, I've seen you
and her together.

312
00:16:11,453 --> 00:16:12,954
She has a
wedding ring.

313
00:16:13,021 --> 00:16:14,154
Her last name's Delko.

314
00:16:14,221 --> 00:16:15,987
I can do the math.
Good.

315
00:16:16,054 --> 00:16:17,487
Then you can do the time.

316
00:16:17,554 --> 00:16:20,054
I'll let the state attorney know
to give you the max.

317
00:16:22,154 --> 00:16:25,154
Okay, I'll get her purse.

318
00:16:25,221 --> 00:16:26,720
You want to come in?

319
00:16:29,821 --> 00:16:31,420
Get your checkbook, too.

320
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:33,254
For the window?
Yeah.

321
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,987
For both of them.

322
00:16:42,887 --> 00:16:43,921
Horatio.

323
00:16:43,987 --> 00:16:45,254
Get the warrant, Frank?

324
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,854
Fastest I got one
from anybody.

325
00:16:46,921 --> 00:16:49,453
Gunfire in a courtroom
will do that.

326
00:16:52,221 --> 00:16:53,887
MAN ( <i>over radio</i> ):
Surrounding
Japanese restaurant.

327
00:16:53,954 --> 00:16:56,720
Four suspected Mala Noche gang
members <i>believed to be inside.</i>

328
00:16:56,787 --> 00:16:59,021
They are heavily armed
and extremely dangerous.

329
00:16:59,087 --> 00:17:03,420
Repeat, they are heavily armed
and extremely dangerous.

330
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:06,787
Team seven to the flank;
watch triangulation and fire.

331
00:17:06,854 --> 00:17:10,021
OFFICER:
One... two... three.
( <i>gunshots</i> )

332
00:17:10,087 --> 00:17:13,154
All clear.

333
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:16,554
Restaurant's close
to the courthouse.

334
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:19,121
Good place
to disappear quickly.

335
00:17:19,188 --> 00:17:20,554
Yes, and the cigarettes
are still burning.

336
00:17:23,987 --> 00:17:25,188
And there are the clothes.

337
00:17:25,254 --> 00:17:26,720
Someone tipped them off
we were coming.

338
00:17:26,787 --> 00:17:28,221
Well, it
wasn't Benito.

339
00:17:28,288 --> 00:17:30,320
I've had guys sitting on him
since we hooked him up.

340
00:17:30,387 --> 00:17:32,154
No phone calls,
no visitors.

341
00:17:32,221 --> 00:17:33,353
Who else knew?

342
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:35,654
Only the judge
who signed the warrant.

343
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,620
Who else?

344
00:17:37,687 --> 00:17:39,654
I don't know-- clerk,
state attorney?

345
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,821
What about
the janitor, Frank?

346
00:17:44,854 --> 00:17:46,821
What's going on?

347
00:17:46,887 --> 00:17:48,921
Cops picked me up,
told me nothing.

348
00:17:48,987 --> 00:17:52,420
HORATIO:
That's because you're going to
do all the talking, Mr. Parker.

349
00:17:52,487 --> 00:17:54,487
Hey, look, why
don't we go inside

350
00:17:54,554 --> 00:17:56,420
or someplace else?
What's the problem?

351
00:17:56,487 --> 00:17:57,954
It's a beautiful day out here.

352
00:17:58,021 --> 00:18:00,387
And it could be your last
with the Mala Noches

353
00:18:00,453 --> 00:18:01,353
floating around,
Mr. Parker.

354
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:02,921
We did some checking.

355
00:18:02,987 --> 00:18:07,288
You have no daughters, no wife,
which means no one to threaten.

356
00:18:16,387 --> 00:18:18,587
All right, all right,
it's true, all right?

357
00:18:18,654 --> 00:18:20,353
I was in it for the money.

358
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:22,520
How did you tip them to us?

359
00:18:22,587 --> 00:18:24,921
Every day, I get cell phone
numbers from the Noches.

360
00:18:24,987 --> 00:18:26,453
Burners.

361
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,254
I call them if I got a lead.

362
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,854
I saw your
warrant issue--

363
00:18:30,921 --> 00:18:32,453
confirmed copies, clerk's mail.

364
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,221
That was a hot tip?

365
00:18:34,288 --> 00:18:35,854
Hey, listen, guys, all right?
I don't know where

366
00:18:35,921 --> 00:18:36,954
they went-- I'm telling you.

367
00:18:37,021 --> 00:18:38,754
Frank, check his cell phone.

368
00:18:48,453 --> 00:18:50,221
MARISOL:
Hey.

369
00:18:52,188 --> 00:18:53,687
Where's your protection?

370
00:18:53,754 --> 00:18:57,154
No, I just told him I was
going to come see you.

371
00:18:57,221 --> 00:18:58,620
You got my purse back.

372
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:01,554
Yeah. Look, I'm sorry
it was taken in the first place.

373
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:02,754
Thank u.

374
00:19:02,821 --> 00:19:03,821
Is everything
still inside?

375
00:19:03,887 --> 00:19:05,520
Yeah, the motive
was never robbery.

376
00:19:05,587 --> 00:19:07,154
This girl thought
you were my wife.

377
00:19:07,221 --> 00:19:09,087
Your wife?

378
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:13,687
She's not balanced, okay?

379
00:19:13,754 --> 00:19:15,188
I'm actually glad
that she didn't

380
00:19:15,254 --> 00:19:16,487
do something more serious.

381
00:19:16,554 --> 00:19:18,520
Your girlfriend.

382
00:19:22,754 --> 00:19:24,687
What? What's up?

383
00:19:24,754 --> 00:19:28,353
I thought I saw a glint
or something.

384
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:30,254
Eric! Eric!

385
00:19:44,254 --> 00:19:45,754
Francis.
Horatio.

386
00:19:45,821 --> 00:19:47,453
Shots were fired;
The Delkos were hit.

387
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,188
Mari. Mari, you're
going to be okay.

388
00:19:55,254 --> 00:19:56,654
Sit down here,
come on.

389
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,021
Eric, you okay?

390
00:19:58,087 --> 00:19:59,121
I'm fine-- Marisol's been hit.

391
00:19:59,188 --> 00:20:00,420
MAN:
Lieutenant.
Talk to me.

392
00:20:00,487 --> 00:20:01,520
Projectile entered her abdomen.

393
00:20:01,587 --> 00:20:02,754
It's still in her.

394
00:20:02,821 --> 00:20:04,854
Okay, load her,
I'm going with her.

395
00:20:04,921 --> 00:20:06,620
All right, load her.
Sweetheart, here we go.

396
00:20:06,687 --> 00:20:08,121
I'm here.

397
00:20:08,188 --> 00:20:09,654
We're going to go
for a little ride.

398
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,720
Load her! Let's go!

399
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:23,787
Don't ever leave me.

400
00:20:23,854 --> 00:20:24,987
Never.

401
00:20:38,188 --> 00:20:39,587
What happened?

402
00:20:39,654 --> 00:20:41,087
A car's blocking the way.

403
00:20:41,154 --> 00:20:42,420
They're not moving--
I don't understand.

404
00:20:45,021 --> 00:20:46,121
They're here for me.

405
00:20:47,353 --> 00:20:48,487
I'm getting out.

406
00:20:58,353 --> 00:20:59,254
Whoa, whoa, hold on!

407
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,188
I got you.

408
00:21:06,487 --> 00:21:08,320
Radio the E.R.

409
00:21:08,387 --> 00:21:09,921
Inbound G.S.W. is diving.

410
00:21:09,987 --> 00:21:11,620
We have uncontrollable
abdominal bleeding.

411
00:21:30,587 --> 00:21:32,654
Stay down.

412
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,188
Stay down.

413
00:21:43,887 --> 00:21:46,087
( <i>mouthing</i> )
I'm trying to get this
back into you.'

414
00:21:46,154 --> 00:21:47,420
I can't find a vein!

415
00:21:47,487 --> 00:21:50,254
Inserting subclavian line.

416
00:22:11,808 --> 00:22:13,674
Lieutenant.

417
00:22:13,741 --> 00:22:15,140
What do you think?

418
00:22:15,207 --> 00:22:16,973
We were able
to extract the bullet.

419
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,441
It entered her kidney and
then penetrated her spleen,

420
00:22:19,507 --> 00:22:21,541
but we lost
precious time with her.

421
00:22:21,607 --> 00:22:23,940
Okay.
In some way,
I'm sorry to say,

422
00:22:24,007 --> 00:22:25,940
that car was
more dangerous
than the bullet.

423
00:22:26,007 --> 00:22:27,507
What about her chances?

424
00:22:27,574 --> 00:22:29,240
Well, she's stable right now.
( <i>door opens</i> )

425
00:22:29,307 --> 00:22:30,940
I'll call you if
her condition changes.

426
00:22:31,007 --> 00:22:32,607
Thank you, doctor.

427
00:22:38,374 --> 00:22:41,073
I can't believe this, H.

428
00:22:43,674 --> 00:22:46,240
Did you call
your parents yet?

429
00:22:46,307 --> 00:22:49,441
Yeah. They're on the way.

430
00:22:49,507 --> 00:22:50,474
Okay.

431
00:22:50,541 --> 00:22:51,874
Eric...

432
00:22:55,474 --> 00:22:57,741
You get the shooter,
I'll get the driver.

433
00:23:18,374 --> 00:23:21,541
You fight, Mari, okay?

434
00:23:21,607 --> 00:23:24,073
You fight.

435
00:23:34,707 --> 00:23:37,140
REPORTER:
<i>Three members of</i>
<i>the Mala Noche gang</i>

436
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:39,107
<i>have been taken into custody</i>
<i>for attempted murder.</i>

437
00:23:39,174 --> 00:23:42,507
<i>One is still at large,</i>

438
00:23:44,207 --> 00:23:45,674
WOODS:
The city's going crazy today.

439
00:23:45,741 --> 00:23:47,274
Shooting up a courtroom,

440
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:49,474
trying to kill Horatio
in broad daylight?

441
00:23:49,541 --> 00:23:50,741
Eric and Marisol!

442
00:23:50,808 --> 00:23:52,073
Most dangerous
kind of criminal

443
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:54,307
is the one
that doesn't care.

444
00:23:54,374 --> 00:23:56,841
Well, at least they're down
two for two.

445
00:23:56,908 --> 00:23:57,973
Yeah, drop
in the bucket.

446
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:00,574
How is she,
Horatio?

447
00:24:00,641 --> 00:24:02,774
She's in good hands, Alexx,
but thank you for asking.

448
00:24:02,841 --> 00:24:04,507
If there's anything I can do.

449
00:24:04,574 --> 00:24:05,808
I appreciate it.

450
00:24:15,274 --> 00:24:16,874
Mr. Wolfe, what is that?

451
00:24:23,207 --> 00:24:25,607
It's a contact lens.

452
00:24:25,674 --> 00:24:28,240
The force of the skid
must have knocked it out.

453
00:24:28,307 --> 00:24:30,240
Maybe that's why
he didn't shoot at you--

454
00:24:30,307 --> 00:24:31,274
couldn't see you.

455
00:24:40,641 --> 00:24:42,574
Either way, this will have
plenty of DNA

456
00:24:42,641 --> 00:24:43,741
from his tear ducts.

457
00:24:43,808 --> 00:24:44,874
Let's get it to the lab.

458
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:46,541
I'll do it right away.

459
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,274
How's your sister?

460
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:55,073
My parents are
with her right now.

461
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:57,841
I just figured I could do
more for her out here,

462
00:24:57,908 --> 00:24:58,973
helping to find her shooter.

463
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:01,207
All right.

464
00:25:01,274 --> 00:25:04,240
Well, let's get to work
and see what we find.

465
00:25:04,307 --> 00:25:06,340
It's most likely
a Mala Noche shooter,

466
00:25:06,407 --> 00:25:08,174
but we have to follow
the evidence.

467
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,841
We believe that the shots came

468
00:25:09,908 --> 00:25:11,140
from across the street.

469
00:25:11,207 --> 00:25:13,107
We found the bullet
that grazed your arm

470
00:25:13,174 --> 00:25:14,340
embedded in the post.

471
00:25:14,407 --> 00:25:15,707
Why, what's up?

472
00:25:15,774 --> 00:25:18,874
Nothing, I thought saw
a glint or something.

473
00:25:26,841 --> 00:25:28,441
Bullet traveled at
a downward trajectory.

474
00:25:28,507 --> 00:25:30,874
What caliber round
was the shooter using?

475
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:33,441
A .308.
It's a sniper caliber,

476
00:25:33,507 --> 00:25:37,073
which expands our
search area considerably...

477
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:38,374
into Noche territory.

478
00:25:38,441 --> 00:25:40,240
Judging by the depth and
the angle of the bullet,

479
00:25:40,307 --> 00:25:42,274
I believe that
the shots were fired

480
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:43,474
from an elevated platform.

481
00:25:46,808 --> 00:25:48,140
The bullet
came from that building.

482
00:25:48,207 --> 00:25:49,908
I saw a glint

483
00:25:49,973 --> 00:25:51,240
right before the shots rang out.

484
00:25:51,307 --> 00:25:53,574
We have to extrapolate
from the variables.

485
00:25:53,641 --> 00:25:55,374
Depending on the distance,

486
00:25:55,441 --> 00:25:58,340
there are several
different trajectories.

487
00:26:10,641 --> 00:26:12,674
Well, if this is
where your shooter was,

488
00:26:12,741 --> 00:26:15,808
they never expected us
to find this spot.

489
00:26:15,874 --> 00:26:18,441
Well, let's hope
there's more to find.

490
00:26:23,607 --> 00:26:25,641
Oh, I've got something.

491
00:26:28,674 --> 00:26:29,841
It's a woman's fingernail.

492
00:26:29,908 --> 00:26:31,274
Is there any chance

493
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:33,140
the Noches are using
female assassins?

494
00:26:34,973 --> 00:26:36,541
No.

495
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,808
Those are Gloria's.

496
00:26:39,874 --> 00:26:41,607
I saw them
on her today.

497
00:26:41,674 --> 00:26:43,174
I'm going to find her.

498
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,874
Eric?

499
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:48,474
If you find her... follow
procedure, don't make it worse.

500
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,207
Valera. Status on
the contact lens?

501
00:26:53,274 --> 00:26:54,973
You were right,
it was brimming with DNA.

502
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,874
Who'd we get?
Your guy with
the bad vision?

503
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:58,973
"Memmo Fierro."

504
00:26:59,040 --> 00:26:59,973
That's the driver.

505
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,841
The guy who
cut you off.

506
00:27:01,908 --> 00:27:04,207
Problem is, there's
no last known address.

507
00:27:04,274 --> 00:27:05,541
We don't need it,
we've got his car.

508
00:27:05,607 --> 00:27:06,908
Thank you.

509
00:27:36,073 --> 00:27:37,940
I ran a brand check
on those cigarettes

510
00:27:38,007 --> 00:27:39,407
we got in the car ashtray.

511
00:27:39,474 --> 00:27:40,674
They're Venenos.

512
00:27:40,741 --> 00:27:41,841
Salvadoran.

513
00:27:41,908 --> 00:27:44,073
These are
Panamanian,

514
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:45,741
and these
are Bolivian.

515
00:27:45,808 --> 00:27:48,307
And this car's registered
in New York.

516
00:27:48,374 --> 00:27:50,174
So it looks like everyone's
headed to Miami,

517
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,641
and I'm guessing
not for vacation.

518
00:27:51,707 --> 00:27:54,574
Not for a vacation,
for a Universal, Mr. Wolfe.

519
00:27:54,641 --> 00:27:57,174
Meeting of all the Noche heads.

520
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,407
It's why they broke
Sifuentes out.

521
00:27:59,474 --> 00:28:02,073
He must be a really big
deal in the Noches.

522
00:28:04,574 --> 00:28:06,474
What is this?

523
00:28:07,641 --> 00:28:08,774
On the front tire rim?

524
00:28:10,441 --> 00:28:11,507
It's blood.

525
00:28:11,574 --> 00:28:13,374
I'll have DNA
confirm it.

526
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:15,841
No, nobody was shot
up there.

527
00:28:25,574 --> 00:28:26,874
So what is it?

528
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:28,407
I don't know, get it to trace.

529
00:28:42,207 --> 00:28:44,107
Get out of the car.

530
00:28:44,174 --> 00:28:45,574
Get the hell
out of the car!

531
00:28:45,641 --> 00:28:46,874
What are you doing here?

532
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:48,808
Wh you mean is,
you thought you got me

533
00:28:48,874 --> 00:28:50,940
with that shot, right?
Tried to kill my sister, too!

534
00:28:51,007 --> 00:28:52,407
Now open the trunk!

535
00:28:52,474 --> 00:28:54,207
I didn't shoot her.

536
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:55,240
Open the trunk!

537
00:29:00,674 --> 00:29:02,174
If you didn't shoot her,
then what's this?

538
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,641
That isn't mine.

539
00:29:03,707 --> 00:29:04,908
You're going to tell me
you don't remember

540
00:29:04,973 --> 00:29:06,908
showing me that
on our first date?

541
00:29:06,973 --> 00:29:08,973
And you used it
this afternoon?!

542
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:11,240
Hey. You... you have
no proof of that.

543
00:29:11,307 --> 00:29:12,340
No, but I will.

544
00:29:12,407 --> 00:29:13,607
You know what?

545
00:29:13,674 --> 00:29:15,340
I am beginning to remember
why we broke up!

546
00:29:15,407 --> 00:29:16,874
I never forgot!

547
00:29:24,774 --> 00:29:25,973
You were right,
the red substance

548
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,207
you found
on the wheel rim,

549
00:29:27,274 --> 00:29:28,407
wasn't biological.

550
00:29:28,474 --> 00:29:30,174
So I ran it
through the mass spec.

551
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,973
It's dye.

552
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,441
The city runs select tests
to ensure

553
00:29:33,507 --> 00:29:35,374
that parasites
and other foreign substances

554
00:29:35,441 --> 00:29:36,707
aren't transported
through our water system.

555
00:29:36,774 --> 00:29:38,707
They use it to check
flow patterns.

556
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:47,707
So that's what this is.

557
00:29:47,774 --> 00:29:49,541
Came from
the sprinkler system.

558
00:29:49,607 --> 00:29:52,207
So I called the WASD,
and they told me

559
00:29:52,274 --> 00:29:53,474
only one part of
the county

560
00:29:53,541 --> 00:29:55,174
is currently
being tested.

561
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,707
Star Island.

562
00:29:56,774 --> 00:29:58,107
That narrows it down,
doesn't it?

563
00:29:58,174 --> 00:29:59,340
Figured if there's a Universal,

564
00:29:59,407 --> 00:30:00,808
there's gonna be
a lot of cars there.

565
00:30:00,874 --> 00:30:03,040
And a lot of heat
from those cars.

566
00:30:03,107 --> 00:30:05,707
They'll use a house as
a base of operations.

567
00:30:05,774 --> 00:30:09,007
Be holed up there
probably 24-36 hours.

568
00:30:09,073 --> 00:30:10,674
So I had the
satellite search

569
00:30:10,741 --> 00:30:12,340
for multiple
heat sources.

570
00:30:15,407 --> 00:30:16,340
Bingo.

571
00:30:16,407 --> 00:30:18,441
"351 Star Island."

572
00:31:28,374 --> 00:31:29,374
Don't move!
Don't move!

573
00:31:31,808 --> 00:31:33,307
OFFICER:
Do it now!
Hands behind your head!

574
00:31:33,374 --> 00:31:35,474
Hands behind
your head!

575
00:32:04,174 --> 00:32:06,274
The party's over, Raphael.

576
00:32:20,204 --> 00:32:22,370
You guys are pretty good.

577
00:32:22,437 --> 00:32:24,871
The same can't be said
about you, my friend.

578
00:32:24,938 --> 00:32:26,404
TRIPP:
Bad idea, Sifuentes.

579
00:32:26,471 --> 00:32:29,504
Having that Universal
the same day you bust out.

580
00:32:29,571 --> 00:32:32,504
Well, you know,
time ain't cheap.

581
00:32:32,571 --> 00:32:34,204
Neither is life.

582
00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:36,404
TRIPP:
As we speak, sweeps are
happening nationwide.

583
00:32:36,471 --> 00:32:38,437
Noche's are
going down.

584
00:32:38,504 --> 00:32:39,737
They can thank
you for that.

585
00:32:41,771 --> 00:32:43,237
What you still
talking to me for?

586
00:32:43,304 --> 00:32:45,237
I want Memmo Fierro.

587
00:32:45,304 --> 00:32:47,270
Memmo?

588
00:32:47,337 --> 00:32:48,571
He's down in Mexico.

589
00:32:48,637 --> 00:32:50,537
That's not true, is it, Raphael?

590
00:32:50,604 --> 00:32:52,871
He ran an ambulance
off the road,

591
00:32:52,938 --> 00:32:55,170
and my wife may die
because of it.

592
00:32:55,237 --> 00:32:56,404
Then why ask?

593
00:32:56,471 --> 00:32:58,838
Because you know where he .

594
00:32:58,904 --> 00:33:00,103
You tell us,
you can help yourself.

595
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:02,404
Got nothing on us.

596
00:33:02,471 --> 00:33:05,337
On the contrary, Raphael,
I've got your safe house.

597
00:33:05,404 --> 00:33:06,370
Frank.

598
00:33:06,437 --> 00:33:08,070
Officer Jessop's already on it.

599
00:33:08,137 --> 00:33:10,571
We're going to find
your compadre.

600
00:33:13,604 --> 00:33:14,970
Calleigh, you have anything?

601
00:33:15,037 --> 00:33:18,170
Yeah. I just finished my
test fire of Gloria's rifle.

602
00:33:18,237 --> 00:33:19,304
And?

603
00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:20,604
And I was about
to compare it

604
00:33:20,671 --> 00:33:22,537
to the bullet that we got
from the wall.

605
00:33:22,604 --> 00:33:25,204
But I can tell you
that typical magazine

606
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:27,571
to bolt action .308
holds five rounds.

607
00:33:27,637 --> 00:33:29,704
I emptied this one,
and I got three.

608
00:33:29,771 --> 00:33:31,037
Which is consistent

609
00:33:31,103 --> 00:33:32,571
with two shots
being fired at you and Marisol.

610
00:33:35,604 --> 00:33:38,838
I never thought that it would go
from breaking windows to this.

611
00:33:45,170 --> 00:33:46,170
Wait a minute.

612
00:33:49,103 --> 00:33:50,237
I don't think she did.

613
00:33:50,304 --> 00:33:51,737
Why?

614
00:33:51,804 --> 00:33:53,504
The striations don't match.

615
00:33:53,571 --> 00:33:55,370
This isn't your gun,
Gloria isn't your shooter.

616
00:33:57,103 --> 00:33:59,103
I told you it wasn't me.

617
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:02,103
My sister's in the
hospital, okay?

618
00:34:02,170 --> 00:34:04,270
And whoever shot her
is still out there.

619
00:34:04,337 --> 00:34:06,170
I know you were
there, okay?

620
00:34:06,237 --> 00:34:07,704
We found your fingernail
at the scene.

621
00:34:07,771 --> 00:34:09,737
Now, tell me what
the hell you saw.

622
00:34:09,804 --> 00:34:12,604
Look, I followed you
from my house.

623
00:34:12,671 --> 00:34:15,771
I was all set up.

624
00:34:15,838 --> 00:34:18,637
I had Marisol
in my sights, and I...

625
00:34:18,704 --> 00:34:20,237
Look, my mind was
just screaming...

626
00:34:22,604 --> 00:34:26,304
.but I couldn't
pull the trigger.

627
00:34:26,370 --> 00:34:31,070
And then I heard a shot.

628
00:34:31,137 --> 00:34:33,504
I couldn't believe that that's
what I was thinking of doing.

629
00:34:35,871 --> 00:34:38,838
Eric, I'm so sorry.

630
00:34:38,904 --> 00:34:42,204
Stop being sorry, okay,
and start being helpful.

631
00:34:43,704 --> 00:34:45,471
Where did the shot come from?

632
00:34:53,304 --> 00:34:55,170
Where did the shot come from?

633
00:34:55,237 --> 00:34:58,304
From the right, above me.

634
00:34:58,370 --> 00:34:59,604
Did it echo?

635
00:34:59,671 --> 00:35:00,871
Yes.

636
00:35:00,938 --> 00:35:02,504
Okay, then it came
from a covered balcony.

637
00:35:02,571 --> 00:35:05,103
Does that help?

638
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:07,504
You better hope so.

639
00:35:43,404 --> 00:35:44,904
Officer Jessop.

640
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:46,904
That Universal safe house
was a gold mine.

641
00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:48,003
Found a ton of money

642
00:35:48,070 --> 00:35:49,304
and an arsenal in there, sir.

643
00:35:49,370 --> 00:35:51,137
Yes, and a .308, I see.

644
00:35:51,204 --> 00:35:52,370
Get it to
Firearms, please.

645
00:35:52,437 --> 00:35:53,437
Yes, sir.

646
00:35:55,471 --> 00:35:57,838
So it was the Noches
that shot Mari, huh?

647
00:35:57,904 --> 00:35:59,070
Certainly looks
that way, Eric.

648
00:35:59,137 --> 00:36:00,838
We got to get
them for this.

649
00:36:00,904 --> 00:36:03,737
We're going to get them.

650
00:36:06,771 --> 00:36:08,070
Delko.

651
00:36:08,137 --> 00:36:10,871
Yes, Doctor.

652
00:36:10,938 --> 00:36:13,170
I'll tell him.

653
00:36:13,237 --> 00:36:14,871
Is that the hospital?

654
00:36:14,938 --> 00:36:16,838
Yeah.

655
00:36:16,904 --> 00:36:17,838
She's asking for you.

656
00:36:17,904 --> 00:36:19,504
I'm on my way.

657
00:36:19,571 --> 00:36:21,170
I'm gonna run with this.

658
00:36:21,237 --> 00:36:23,604
Calleigh thinks she found
where the shooter really was.

659
00:36:23,671 --> 00:36:25,737
Eric, wait for me.

660
00:37:03,604 --> 00:37:06,804
Don't be sad.

661
00:37:08,804 --> 00:37:12,671
I have dinner plans tonight.

662
00:37:14,704 --> 00:37:15,637
Casa Tua?

663
00:37:15,704 --> 00:37:17,404
Casa Tua.
8:30?

664
00:37:17,471 --> 00:37:19,170
8:30.

665
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:21,471
Did you get the good table?

666
00:37:21,537 --> 00:37:22,804
Got the good table.

667
00:37:29,204 --> 00:37:31,838
You, um...

668
00:37:31,904 --> 00:37:35,370
You're not planning to...

669
00:37:35,437 --> 00:37:39,337
You're not planning
to stand me up, are you?

670
00:37:43,003 --> 00:37:45,337
Never.

671
00:38:46,637 --> 00:38:48,704
Should have accounted for the
slight variance in trajectory

672
00:38:48,771 --> 00:38:50,437
when the bullet
grazed your arm.

673
00:38:50,504 --> 00:38:51,671
We were off
by six degrees.

674
00:38:51,737 --> 00:38:53,871
We were looking
on the wrong floor.

675
00:38:53,938 --> 00:38:54,871
There it is.

676
00:38:54,938 --> 00:38:57,103
What?

677
00:38:57,170 --> 00:38:58,103
GSR cone.

678
00:38:58,170 --> 00:38:59,370
When a gun like this

679
00:38:59,437 --> 00:39:01,137
is fired,
the escaping gasses settle.

680
00:39:09,370 --> 00:39:11,737
So Memmo was
definitely here.

681
00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:17,204
Well, they took their gun
back to the safe house,

682
00:39:17,270 --> 00:39:18,571
but not everything.

683
00:39:19,604 --> 00:39:21,304
What is it?

684
00:39:21,370 --> 00:39:23,737
<i>Lo mas dulce</i>
<i>de la cana.</i>

685
00:39:23,804 --> 00:39:27,237
It's two boutique-sized
bottles of Yarmy rum.

686
00:39:27,304 --> 00:39:29,404
Memmo must have tried
to calm his nerves.

687
00:39:29,471 --> 00:39:32,370
Only one hotel in Miami
that uses these as a guest perk.

688
00:39:32,437 --> 00:39:33,604
That's the Marano.

689
00:39:33,671 --> 00:39:35,304
That must be where
he's staying.

690
00:39:35,370 --> 00:39:37,270
I imagine that you and Horatio

691
00:39:37,337 --> 00:39:38,938
are gonna want
to take it from here.

692
00:39:39,003 --> 00:39:41,003
Yeah.

693
00:39:50,003 --> 00:39:51,003
H.

694
00:40:00,970 --> 00:40:02,804
Okay.

695
00:40:04,838 --> 00:40:08,871
I am so sorry.

696
00:41:09,137 --> 00:41:10,370
We got Memmo Fierro.

697
00:41:10,437 --> 00:41:11,671
Mm.

698
00:41:11,737 --> 00:41:13,871
Tripp picked him up
at the Marano Hotel,

699
00:41:13,938 --> 00:41:15,637
just like we thought.

700
00:41:15,704 --> 00:41:16,704
Let's go.

701
00:41:18,804 --> 00:41:20,871
FIERRO:
<i>Hey, let me out of here!</i>

702
00:41:37,103 --> 00:41:38,270
FIERRO ( <i>muffled</i> ):
Hey, let me out!

703
00:41:38,337 --> 00:41:39,404
Let me out of here!

704
00:41:39,471 --> 00:41:40,604
Hey, I confessed already!

705
00:41:40,671 --> 00:41:41,871
CAINE:
Come on, let's go.

706
00:41:44,037 --> 00:41:47,270
Memmo, in the unlikely event

707
00:41:47,337 --> 00:41:50,804
that I haven't
made myself clear,

708
00:41:50,871 --> 00:41:54,737
you deserve to know
that this is your last chance.

709
00:41:54,804 --> 00:41:55,871
Hey, I already
confessed.

710
00:41:55,938 --> 00:41:58,103
I shot her.

711
00:42:04,137 --> 00:42:07,304
Who put the hit on my sister?

712
00:42:07,370 --> 00:42:09,671
Who gave the order?

713
00:42:16,170 --> 00:42:18,504
Riaz. Antonio Riaz.

00:42:18,571 --> 00:42:21,103
The snitch that was
on the stand today?

715
00:42:22,737 --> 00:42:24,304
<i>Si.</i>

716
00:42:24,370 --> 00:42:25,938
He wanted you to know...

717
00:42:27,804 --> 00:42:30,970
...it's his city now.

718
00:42:31,037 --> 00:42:35,437
Memmo, now that you work for me,
here's what I want you to do.

719
00:42:35,504 --> 00:42:39,571
I want you to tell Mr. Riaz
that I said he's a dead man.
