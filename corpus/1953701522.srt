1
00:00:27,711 --> 00:00:29,761
Your very first princess summit.

2
00:00:29,761 --> 00:00:31,493
You must be over the moon, Twilight.

3
00:00:32,225 --> 00:00:34,266
Oh, I am excited.

4
00:00:34,266 --> 00:00:36,923
But, to be honest, I'm a little nervous, too.

5
00:00:36,923 --> 00:00:38,479
You're nervicited!

6
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:41,754
It's like you wanna jump up and down and yell "YAY ME!!"

7
00:00:42,107 --> 00:00:44,839
But you also wanna curl up in a teeny-tiny ball

8
00:00:44,839 --> 00:00:46,970
and hide at the same time!

9
00:00:49,845 --> 00:00:51,665
We've all been there!

10
00:00:52,336 --> 00:00:54,255
I'm there almost every day.

11
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:57,243
You've got no reason to fret, Twi.

12
00:00:57,243 --> 00:00:58,870
Everything's gonna be just...

13
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:00,270
TWILIGHT!

14
00:01:00,293 --> 00:01:03,403
Oh, sorry, darling, but I just realized

15
00:01:03,403 --> 00:01:04,926
you're not wearing your crown.

16
00:01:04,969 --> 00:01:07,869
You haven't forgotten it back in Ponyville, have you?

17
00:01:07,869 --> 00:01:09,136
It's in my bag.

18
00:01:10,318 --> 00:01:12,791
Just feel a little self-conscious about wearing it.

19
00:01:12,791 --> 00:01:15,761
Haven't really gotten accustomed to these yet, either...

20
00:01:18,562 --> 00:01:20,980
You are a princess now, Twilight.

21
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:21,944
Embrace it!

22
00:01:22,278 --> 00:01:24,894
I'm telling you, if I had a crown like that,

23
00:01:24,894 --> 00:01:26,387
I would never take it off.

24
00:01:26,387 --> 00:01:27,912
Why, I'd sleep in the thing.

25
00:01:41,958 --> 00:01:45,619
Her highness, Princess Twilight Sparkle!

26
00:01:47,059 --> 00:01:48,172
Twilight!

27
00:01:48,172 --> 00:01:50,697
I haven't seen you since the coronation!

28
00:01:50,697 --> 00:01:52,932
We have so much to discuss.

29
00:01:52,932 --> 00:01:55,199
But it can wait until tomorrow.

30
00:01:55,199 --> 00:01:57,578
You all look tired from your journey.

31
00:01:57,578 --> 00:01:59,517
Now, off to bed, all of you.

32
00:02:16,744 --> 00:02:18,014
What's wrong, Twilight?

33
00:02:18,188 --> 00:02:19,759
I don't know, Spike.

34
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:21,795
I'm just... worried, I guess.

35
00:02:21,795 --> 00:02:24,975
Princess Cadance was given the Crystal Empire to rule over.

36
00:02:24,975 --> 00:02:26,648
What if now that I'm a princess,

37
00:02:26,648 --> 00:02:29,076
Celestia expects me to lead a kingdom of my own?

38
00:02:29,489 --> 00:02:31,671
That would be awesome!

39
00:02:31,671 --> 00:02:33,641
No, it would not!

40
00:02:33,641 --> 00:02:35,955
Just because I have this crown and these wings,

41
00:02:35,955 --> 00:02:37,997
it doesn't mean I'll be a good leader!

42
00:02:38,809 --> 00:02:40,863
Aw, sure you will, Twilight.

43
00:02:40,863 --> 00:02:43,117
Now come on, you should get some shut-eye

44
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:44,519
Big day tomorrow!

45
00:02:54,062 --> 00:02:54,745
Can't...

46
00:02:54,785 --> 00:02:55,442
tuck...

47
00:02:58,451 --> 00:03:01,207
Just trying to get comfortable!

48
00:05:47,418 --> 00:05:48,818
Huh? What?

49
00:05:52,688 --> 00:05:53,547
My crown!

50
00:05:53,547 --> 00:05:54,759
She's got my crown!

51
00:05:56,824 --> 00:05:57,559
Stop!

52
00:05:57,559 --> 00:05:58,271
Thief!

53
00:05:59,331 --> 00:06:00,742
She's stolen my crown!

54
00:06:03,975 --> 00:06:04,753
Stop!

55
00:06:20,049 --> 00:06:21,998
What did you do with my crown?

56
00:06:21,998 --> 00:06:23,851
Sorry it had to be this way...

57
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:26,858
Princess!

58
00:06:29,503 --> 00:06:30,910
Who was that?

59
00:06:34,091 --> 00:06:35,256
Sunset Shimmer.

60
00:06:35,256 --> 00:06:36,962
A former student of mine.

61
00:06:36,962 --> 00:06:40,711
She began her studies with me not long before Twilight.

62
00:06:40,711 --> 00:06:43,595
But when she did not get what she wanted as quickly as she liked,

63
00:06:43,595 --> 00:06:45,657
she turned cruel and dishonest.

64
00:06:46,111 --> 00:06:47,232
I tried to help her,

65
00:06:47,232 --> 00:06:49,999
but she eventually decided to abandon her studies

66
00:06:49,999 --> 00:06:51,404
and pursue her own path.

67
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:53,968
One that has sadly led to her stealing your crown.

68
00:06:54,022 --> 00:06:57,140
She replaced Twilight's with this one.

69
00:06:57,967 --> 00:07:00,699
I suppose Sunset Shimmer thought you wouldn't notice right away

70
00:07:00,699 --> 00:07:01,863
that this was not yours.

71
00:07:01,924 --> 00:07:03,257
And by the time you did,

72
00:07:03,257 --> 00:07:06,770
it would be too late to go after your crown and Element of Harmony.

73
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:08,269
But I don't understand!

74
00:07:08,269 --> 00:07:09,788
Where did she go?

75
00:07:09,788 --> 00:07:11,242
Why did she take the crown?

76
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:14,573
You'll soon know more about this place than even I do.

77
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:19,956
This is no ordinary mirror.

78
00:07:19,956 --> 00:07:22,372
It is a gateway to another world.

79
00:07:22,372 --> 00:07:25,808
A gateway that opens once every thirty moons.

80
00:07:26,329 --> 00:07:27,578
Sparkly!

81
00:07:28,541 --> 00:07:31,586
It has always been kept in the throne room of Canterlot Castle.

82
00:07:31,586 --> 00:07:34,196
But when Princess Cadance took over the Crystal Empire,

83
00:07:34,196 --> 00:07:36,278
we sent it here for her to watch over.

84
00:07:36,813 --> 00:07:40,227
I had always hoped that Sunset Shimmer would someday use it to return,

85
00:07:40,227 --> 00:07:43,345
to come back to Equestria seeking my guidance.

86
00:07:43,345 --> 00:07:45,957
Obviously, this is not what has happened.

87
00:07:46,732 --> 00:07:47,588
Twilight,

88
00:07:47,995 --> 00:07:50,898
you must use the mirror  to go into this other world

89
00:07:50,898 --> 00:07:52,697
and retrieve your crown.

90
00:07:53,069 --> 00:07:55,893
Without it, the other Elements of Harmony have no power

91
00:07:55,893 --> 00:07:59,577
and Equestria is left without one of its most important means of defense.

92
00:08:02,716 --> 00:08:07,012
Your crown does not belong in the place Sunset Shimmer now calls home.

93
00:08:07,522 --> 00:08:09,031
And in her possession,

94
00:08:09,031 --> 00:08:11,797
your Element of Harmony will no doubt be used to bring

95
00:08:11,797 --> 00:08:14,010
harm to the inhabitants of this other realm.

96
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:17,413
They will not have the power to defend themselves.

97
00:08:19,389 --> 00:08:21,603
You understand the importance of your task?

98
00:08:21,929 --> 00:08:23,215
Of course.

99
00:08:23,573 --> 00:08:24,281
Good.

100
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:25,728
Then you must go at once.

101
00:08:29,657 --> 00:08:31,582
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

102
00:08:31,582 --> 00:08:33,999
She's going, we're going with her!

103
00:08:33,999 --> 00:08:35,153
Right, girls?

104
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:38,280
I'm so nervicited!

105
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:41,277
You do realize that's not a real word, right?

106
00:08:42,466 --> 00:08:44,362
I'm afraid I can't let you go.

107
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:45,324
What?!

108
00:08:45,324 --> 00:08:46,514
Why not?!

109
00:08:46,738 --> 00:08:50,040
Sending all of you could upset the balance of this alternate world.

110
00:08:50,726 --> 00:08:53,248
Creating havoc that would make it impossible for Twilight

111
00:08:53,248 --> 00:08:55,183
to get the crown back from Sunset Shimmer.

112
00:08:55,674 --> 00:08:58,675
This is something Princess Twilight must do alone.

113
00:08:58,981 --> 00:09:00,413
Time is of the essence.

114
00:09:00,413 --> 00:09:01,796
On the third day,

115
00:09:01,796 --> 00:09:04,484
when the moon reaches its peak in the night sky,

116
00:09:04,484 --> 00:09:06,420
the gateway will close,

117
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,567
and once it does,

118
00:09:07,567 --> 00:09:08,918
it will be another thirty moons

119
00:09:08,918 --> 00:09:11,501
before you will be able to use it to return.

120
00:09:26,201 --> 00:09:27,913
Spike, NO!

121
00:09:37,944 --> 00:09:39,631
Uh, Twilight?

122
00:09:40,423 --> 00:09:41,178
Spike!

123
00:09:41,545 --> 00:09:42,778
You're not supposed to...

124
00:09:44,026 --> 00:09:44,951
Spike?

125
00:09:45,393 --> 00:09:47,263
Are you a dog?

126
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:49,777
I...

127
00:09:49,987 --> 00:09:50,875
think so.

128
00:09:51,513 --> 00:09:52,148
But...

129
00:09:52,148 --> 00:09:54,509
I have no idea what you are!

130
00:10:15,209 --> 00:10:16,090
Twilight,

131
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:17,442
you have to get it together!

132
00:10:21,683 --> 00:10:22,563
What...

133
00:10:22,563 --> 00:10:24,189
does the rest of me look like?

134
00:10:24,189 --> 00:10:25,844
Um, like you.

135
00:10:25,844 --> 00:10:27,436
Only not you.

136
00:10:27,436 --> 00:10:28,972
Your muzzle's really small.

137
00:10:29,426 --> 00:10:30,563
My muzzle?!?

138
00:10:32,902 --> 00:10:34,549
Are you gonna scream again?

139
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:39,919
Where are we?

140
00:10:42,321 --> 00:10:43,328
I don't know.

141
00:10:43,328 --> 00:10:46,138
But that must serve as the gateway back to Equestria.

142
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:49,895
We need to find my crown as soon as possible

143
00:10:49,895 --> 00:10:50,807
and get back there.

144
00:10:53,098 --> 00:10:55,489
I suggest we start searching the castle first.

145
00:10:56,134 --> 00:10:56,992
Works for me.

146
00:11:06,453 --> 00:11:06,879
Yeah,

147
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:09,472
I don't think that's how the new you is supposed to...

148
00:11:21,805 --> 00:11:23,120
Come on, Spike.

149
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,961
I do not wanna be like this for longer than I have to.

150
00:11:26,652 --> 00:11:27,713
Look on the bright side.

151
00:11:27,713 --> 00:11:30,148
You don't have those pesky wings to worry about anymore!

152
00:11:42,507 --> 00:11:43,365
My magic!

153
00:11:43,365 --> 00:11:44,512
It isn't working!

154
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:45,932
Makes sense.

155
00:11:45,932 --> 00:11:47,949
You don't exactly have your horn.

156
00:11:47,949 --> 00:11:48,921
WHAT?

157
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,858
We really need to find you a mirror.

158
00:12:02,804 --> 00:12:03,935
What do you think, Spike?

159
00:12:03,935 --> 00:12:06,313
Other artifacts she's stolen from Equestria?

160
00:12:09,197 --> 00:12:10,647
What am I?

161
00:12:29,491 --> 00:12:30,238
Whoa.

162
00:12:30,321 --> 00:12:31,499
You okay?

163
00:12:40,338 --> 00:12:42,303
I don't think this is a castle.

164
00:12:47,248 --> 00:12:48,944
<i>I've never seen a place</i>

165
00:12:48,944 --> 00:12:50,759
<i>That's quite like this.</i>

166
00:12:50,759 --> 00:12:52,948
<i>Everything is turned around,</i>

167
00:12:52,948 --> 00:12:54,979
<i>This crazy world is upside-down.</i>

168
00:12:54,979 --> 00:12:56,552
<i>Getting on my feet,</i>

169
00:12:56,552 --> 00:12:58,479
<i>It's the hand that I was dealt.</i>

170
00:12:58,479 --> 00:13:00,750
<i>But I don't have much time with them</i>

171
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,556
<i>Got to learn all that I can.</i>

172
00:13:10,278 --> 00:13:12,009
<i>They don't use any magic,</i>

173
00:13:12,009 --> 00:13:13,884
<i>Fly with any wings.</i>

174
00:13:13,884 --> 00:13:15,990
<i>I don't get these funny clothes,</i>

175
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:17,962
<i>Skinny legs or tiny nose.</i>

176
00:13:17,962 --> 00:13:19,429
<i>Everything's confusing</i>

177
00:13:19,429 --> 00:13:21,476
<i>When it seems so new.</i>

178
00:13:21,476 --> 00:13:23,211
<i>But I look a little closer and</i>

179
00:13:23,211 --> 00:13:25,478
<i>It starts to feel familiar too.</i>

180
00:13:31,796 --> 00:13:36,946
<i>What a strange new world.</i>

181
00:13:36,946 --> 00:13:39,386
<i>I'm trying to make heads or tails</i>

182
00:13:39,386 --> 00:13:44,398
<i>Of this strange new world.</i>

183
00:13:44,398 --> 00:13:47,040
<i>Sorting through the small details</i>

184
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,653
<i>Of a strange new world.</i>

185
00:13:50,653 --> 00:13:54,960
<i>What a strange new world.</i>

186
00:14:03,288 --> 00:14:04,620
I'm really sorry.

187
00:14:05,136 --> 00:14:06,344
I just found it,

188
00:14:06,344 --> 00:14:07,953
and I thought I should give it to her.

189
00:14:08,191 --> 00:14:10,144
I didn't know you had dropped it.

190
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,656
Well, I did!

191
00:14:11,656 --> 00:14:12,484
And I was about to get it

192
00:14:12,484 --> 00:14:14,882
before you swooped in and ruined everything!

193
00:14:14,882 --> 00:14:17,754
You shouldn't pick up things that don't belong to you.

194
00:14:17,754 --> 00:14:20,150
It... doesn't really belong to you, either.

195
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,839
Excuse me?!?

196
00:14:23,004 --> 00:14:23,989
N-n-nothing...

197
00:14:24,081 --> 00:14:25,433
That's what I thought.

198
00:14:25,433 --> 00:14:27,643
It's as good as mine and you know it.

199
00:14:27,643 --> 00:14:29,155
You really are pathetic.

200
00:14:29,155 --> 00:14:31,725
It's no wonder your best friends are all stray animals.

201
00:14:32,644 --> 00:14:34,966
How dare you speak to her that way!

202
00:14:36,336 --> 00:14:37,851
What did you say?

203
00:14:38,156 --> 00:14:41,725
I said - how dare you speak to her that way!

204
00:14:45,148 --> 00:14:46,856
You must be new here.

205
00:14:47,673 --> 00:14:51,039
I can speak to anyone any way I want.

206
00:14:54,747 --> 00:14:57,092
I can't believe you did that!

207
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,937
I couldn't just stand there.

208
00:14:58,937 --> 00:15:03,139
Well, it's just that nobody ever stands up to Sunset Shimmer.

209
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,714
Sunset Shimmer!?

210
00:15:07,075 --> 00:15:08,099
You've heard of her?

211
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:09,552
Sort of...

212
00:15:09,552 --> 00:15:11,613
I don't think I've seen you around before.

213
00:15:11,613 --> 00:15:14,890
Did you just transfer to Canterlot High from another school?

214
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:16,741
Um... yes!

215
00:15:17,104 --> 00:15:18,290
Another...

216
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:19,373
heh, school!

217
00:15:19,373 --> 00:15:20,766
My name's Twilight.

218
00:15:22,229 --> 00:15:24,190
I'm... Fluttershy.

219
00:15:24,554 --> 00:15:26,456
Sorry, what was that?

220
00:15:27,019 --> 00:15:27,964
It's Fluttershy!

221
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:31,844
It sounds like you're saying Fluttershy, but how can that...?

222
00:15:33,075 --> 00:15:34,852
Oh, my goodness!

223
00:15:34,852 --> 00:15:37,543
Who's this sweet little guy?

224
00:15:37,543 --> 00:15:38,857
That's Spike!

225
00:15:38,857 --> 00:15:39,812
My, uh...

226
00:15:39,812 --> 00:15:40,826
dog!

227
00:15:40,826 --> 00:15:43,648
Oh, he's so cute!

228
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:46,112
Go on, eat up, little pup!

229
00:15:50,407 --> 00:15:52,912
Oh, wouldn't you just give anything to know

230
00:15:52,912 --> 00:15:54,419
what they're really thinking?

231
00:15:54,546 --> 00:15:56,272
He usually just tells me.

232
00:15:57,019 --> 00:15:58,075
Oh, what do you mean?

233
00:16:00,857 --> 00:16:02,659
Oh, uh, nothing!

234
00:16:02,659 --> 00:16:03,649
Never mind.

235
00:16:03,649 --> 00:16:06,122
Sunset Shimmer said you picked something up.

236
00:16:06,122 --> 00:16:07,832
Something that belonged to her.

237
00:16:07,832 --> 00:16:09,902
It wasn't a crown, was it?

238
00:16:10,191 --> 00:16:11,613
How did you know?

239
00:16:11,613 --> 00:16:13,235
Uh, lucky guess?

240
00:16:13,235 --> 00:16:14,543
Do you still have it?

241
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:17,812
But you know what happened to it.

242
00:16:19,129 --> 00:16:19,817
This morning,

243
00:16:19,817 --> 00:16:22,436
I was passing out flyers for the animal shelter

244
00:16:22,436 --> 00:16:24,133
like I do every Wednesday.

245
00:16:24,513 --> 00:16:27,421
Canterlot's animal shelter needs more volunteers.

246
00:16:27,421 --> 00:16:30,299
Won't you help an animal that can't help itself?

247
00:16:39,835 --> 00:16:41,857
I have no idea how it got there.

248
00:16:41,857 --> 00:16:43,734
But I didn't want anything to happen to it,

249
00:16:43,734 --> 00:16:46,202
so I decided to give it to Principal Celestia.

250
00:16:46,823 --> 00:16:49,015
Principal Celestia?

251
00:16:49,015 --> 00:16:50,419
She's the ruler here?

252
00:16:50,419 --> 00:16:52,461
You could say that.

253
00:16:52,461 --> 00:16:56,826
Technically, I guess she and Vice-Principal Luna do make the rules.

254
00:16:56,826 --> 00:16:58,068
Where is she now?

255
00:16:58,068 --> 00:16:59,406
Probably in her office.

256
00:17:02,309 --> 00:17:03,701
Third door on your left.

257
00:17:03,763 --> 00:17:04,628
Thank you!

258
00:17:05,261 --> 00:17:06,000
Oh, wait!

259
00:17:06,948 --> 00:17:09,438
You're not really supposed to have pets on school grounds.

260
00:17:10,226 --> 00:17:12,439
Might wanna tuck him into your backpack.

261
00:17:12,439 --> 00:17:13,864
That's what I do!

262
00:17:16,722 --> 00:17:19,899
They just get so lonely when I'm in school all day.

263
00:17:20,298 --> 00:17:21,737
Oh, okay!

264
00:17:21,737 --> 00:17:22,963
Thank you!

265
00:17:23,265 --> 00:17:23,870
Oh, no!

266
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:25,110
I'm late for class!

267
00:17:30,074 --> 00:17:30,844
Come in.

268
00:17:34,243 --> 00:17:35,294
How may I help you?

269
00:17:46,185 --> 00:17:47,926
My name's Twilight Sparkle.

270
00:17:47,926 --> 00:17:48,877
I'm new here,

271
00:17:48,877 --> 00:17:49,865
and well,

272
00:17:49,865 --> 00:17:52,454
I understand that Fluttershy found a crown this morning

273
00:17:52,454 --> 00:17:53,457
and gave it to you.

274
00:17:53,729 --> 00:17:54,611
Yes.

275
00:17:54,611 --> 00:17:57,519
I've had Vice-Principal Luna put it somewhere for safekeeping.

276
00:17:57,519 --> 00:18:00,239
No idea how it ended up in the front lawn.

277
00:18:00,764 --> 00:18:04,273
Were you interested in running for Princess of the Fall Formal this year?

278
00:18:04,273 --> 00:18:05,159
Uh, no.

279
00:18:05,159 --> 00:18:06,502
Not exactly.

280
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:07,773
The truth is...

281
00:18:07,773 --> 00:18:09,112
Well, the truth is I...

282
00:18:09,112 --> 00:18:11,411
You see, the crown is actually...

283
00:18:11,411 --> 00:18:13,912
Princess of the Fall Formal?

284
00:18:13,912 --> 00:18:15,886
It's Canterlot High's big Fall dance.

285
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:17,512
Like the Grand Galloping Gala!

286
00:18:17,512 --> 00:18:20,186
Uh, Grand Galloping Gala?

287
00:18:20,186 --> 00:18:24,958
Oh, uh, it was a big deal at my old school.

288
00:18:25,314 --> 00:18:26,844
And was there a princess?

289
00:18:26,844 --> 00:18:29,702
Yes, but she wasn't exactly a student.

290
00:18:29,744 --> 00:18:31,288
Here at Canterlot High,

291
00:18:31,288 --> 00:18:33,914
the students select one of their peers to represent them.

292
00:18:33,914 --> 00:18:35,863
She receives a crown at the Fall Formal.

293
00:18:37,602 --> 00:18:40,531
You asked me if I was interested in running for Princess.

294
00:18:40,859 --> 00:18:42,039
Can anyone run?

295
00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:42,655
Yes,

296
00:18:42,655 --> 00:18:45,268
you just need to let the head of the Fall Formal planning committee know

297
00:18:45,268 --> 00:18:46,567
you'd like to be on the ballot.

298
00:18:46,567 --> 00:18:47,998
Was there anything else?

299
00:18:47,998 --> 00:18:49,418
Um, nope!

300
00:18:49,418 --> 00:18:50,807
That was it!

301
00:18:50,807 --> 00:18:52,604
Well, if you do need anything else,

302
00:18:52,604 --> 00:18:53,925
my door is always open.

303
00:18:56,328 --> 00:18:57,007
Twilight,

304
00:18:57,007 --> 00:18:58,756
why didn't you just tell her the crown was yours

305
00:18:58,756 --> 00:18:59,733
and ask for it back?

306
00:18:59,733 --> 00:19:01,567
Oh, I was going to,

307
00:19:01,567 --> 00:19:04,429
but imagine if one of them showed up in Equestria

308
00:19:04,429 --> 00:19:05,775
saying they came from a place filled with

309
00:19:05,775 --> 00:19:08,298
tall, bushy, two-legged creatures with these?

310
00:19:08,633 --> 00:19:10,023
We'd think they were crazy!

311
00:19:11,907 --> 00:19:13,500
Hmm. You make a good point.

312
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,190
Looks like if I want my crown back,

313
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:18,682
I'll have to become Princess of the Canterlot High Fall Formal.

314
00:19:18,682 --> 00:19:20,482
So that's what I'm gonna do!

315
00:19:22,103 --> 00:19:24,894
And how exactly do you plan on doing that?

316
00:19:24,894 --> 00:19:26,675
I have no idea!

317
00:19:41,871 --> 00:19:43,248
I know we've just met,

318
00:19:43,248 --> 00:19:46,304
but I was wondering if you might be able to help me with something.

319
00:19:46,304 --> 00:19:47,359
Of course!

320
00:19:49,443 --> 00:19:52,550
I've decided to run for Princess of the Fall Formal, and...

321
00:19:54,575 --> 00:19:55,304
Oh, gosh!

322
00:19:56,084 --> 00:19:56,721
Sorry.

323
00:19:56,721 --> 00:19:57,858
It's just, oh,

324
00:19:57,858 --> 00:20:01,412
running for Fall Formal Princess is a REALLY bad idea.

325
00:20:01,412 --> 00:20:02,186
Why?

326
00:20:02,186 --> 00:20:05,091
Sunset Shimmer wants to be Fall Formal Princess,

327
00:20:05,091 --> 00:20:08,001
and when she wants something, she gets it!

328
00:20:08,001 --> 00:20:11,526
She'll make life awful for anyone who stands in her way.

329
00:20:11,526 --> 00:20:15,768
Just ask the girl that ran against her for Princess of the Spring Fling.

330
00:20:16,347 --> 00:20:17,571
I have to try!

331
00:20:18,544 --> 00:20:20,214
I don't think you understand.

332
00:20:20,214 --> 00:20:23,714
You'd have to convince everyone here to vote for you instead of her:

333
00:20:23,909 --> 00:20:25,170
the athletes,

334
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:26,955
the fashionistas,

335
00:20:26,955 --> 00:20:28,632
the dramas,

336
00:20:28,632 --> 00:20:30,486
the eco kids,

337
00:20:30,486 --> 00:20:31,978
the techies,

338
00:20:31,978 --> 00:20:33,099
the rockers.

339
00:20:33,534 --> 00:20:34,993
Why is everypony...

340
00:20:35,981 --> 00:20:39,932
uhh, everybody separated this way?

341
00:20:39,932 --> 00:20:41,821
Maybe it was different at your old school,

342
00:20:41,821 --> 00:20:45,457
but at C.H.S., everybody sticks to their own kind.

343
00:20:45,457 --> 00:20:48,598
One thing that they do have in common is that they know

344
00:20:48,598 --> 00:20:52,306
Sunset Shimmer is going to rule the school until we graduate.

345
00:20:52,653 --> 00:20:54,024
Not if I can help it!

346
00:21:00,688 --> 00:21:01,763
So, uh,

347
00:21:01,763 --> 00:21:04,843
where would I find the head of the party planning committee?

348
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:10,142
Fluttershy said she'd probably be in here.

349
00:21:12,485 --> 00:21:13,885
Incoming!

350
00:21:23,253 --> 00:21:25,712
Hi, my name's Twilight Sparkle and...

351
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:27,441
Pinkie Pie?

352
00:21:30,578 --> 00:21:31,935
Huh, are you psychic?

353
00:21:31,935 --> 00:21:33,059
Uh, no.

354
00:21:33,059 --> 00:21:34,451
I don't think so,

355
00:21:34,451 --> 00:21:36,617
unless of course that's something you can do here.

356
00:21:37,141 --> 00:21:38,218
Eh, not usually.

357
00:21:40,501 --> 00:21:41,989
Fluttershy said this is where I'd find

358
00:21:41,989 --> 00:21:43,949
the head of the Fall Formal planning committee.

359
00:21:43,949 --> 00:21:45,456
Fluttershy, huh?

360
00:21:46,273 --> 00:21:48,564
Don't let the whole "shy" thing fool you.

361
00:21:48,564 --> 00:21:50,370
She can be a real meanie.

362
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:52,120
You two aren't friends?

363
00:21:52,468 --> 00:21:54,607
Waited a bit to get your name on the ballot, huh?

364
00:21:54,607 --> 00:21:56,215
Dance is day after tomorrow.

365
00:21:56,215 --> 00:21:57,530
I'm brand new here.

366
00:21:57,530 --> 00:21:58,531
Oooh!

367
00:21:59,972 --> 00:22:01,757
I thought you didn't look familiar.

368
00:22:01,757 --> 00:22:04,093
Though, now that I'm really lookin' at you,

369
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:07,520
do you have a twin sister who lives in the city,

370
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,700
has a pet dog named Spike

371
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,527
that looks just like that one?

372
00:22:11,526 --> 00:22:13,258
Uh, maybe?

373
00:22:13,258 --> 00:22:14,214
Thought so.

374
00:22:14,512 --> 00:22:16,369
Anywho, just need to fill this out

375
00:22:16,369 --> 00:22:20,549
and you are officially up for the coveted Princess of the Fall Formal crown.

376
00:22:35,722 --> 00:22:36,750
Wow!

377
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:39,385
You have really bad handwriting.

378
00:22:39,385 --> 00:22:41,579
It's like you've never held a pen before.

379
00:22:43,583 --> 00:22:44,309
Is it?

380
00:22:44,493 --> 00:22:47,336
Somebody order a dozen cases of fizzy apple cider?

381
00:22:47,336 --> 00:22:48,571
Oh! Oh! Me,

382
00:22:48,571 --> 00:22:49,454
me-me-me,

383
00:22:49,454 --> 00:22:51,274
me, yeah, ha ha, me!

384
00:22:53,303 --> 00:22:54,536
Can you bring in the rest?

385
00:22:54,999 --> 00:22:55,880
Eeyup.

386
00:22:59,352 --> 00:23:01,140
Hey, I know you.

387
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:02,343
You do?

388
00:23:02,343 --> 00:23:03,265
Sure,

389
00:23:03,265 --> 00:23:06,306
you're the new girl who gave Sunset Shimmer the what for today.

390
00:23:07,523 --> 00:23:09,426
Twilight Sparkle here is going

391
00:23:09,426 --> 00:23:12,773
to run against Sunset Shimmer for Princess of the Fall Formal.

392
00:23:14,788 --> 00:23:16,712
I'd think twice about that.

393
00:23:16,712 --> 00:23:20,212
I'm sure she'll probably approach you all friendly like...

394
00:23:22,879 --> 00:23:26,475
I sure am lookin' forward to some friendly competition.

395
00:23:26,475 --> 00:23:28,271
That's so good to hear.

396
00:23:28,271 --> 00:23:30,909
But then, here comes the backstabbin'.

397
00:23:31,939 --> 00:23:35,236
About the only girl in this school you can trust less than Sunset Shimmer

398
00:23:35,236 --> 00:23:36,197
is Rainbow Dash.

399
00:23:36,558 --> 00:23:37,669
Rainbow Dash?

400
00:23:38,244 --> 00:23:39,742
She's the captain of, like,

401
00:23:39,742 --> 00:23:41,921
every team at Canterlot High.

402
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:45,429
She's also the captain of sayin' how she's going to do somethin' for ya,

403
00:23:45,429 --> 00:23:48,299
and turnin' around and not even botherin' to show up.

404
00:23:48,299 --> 00:23:49,608
Thanks for the advice, Applejack,

405
00:23:49,608 --> 00:23:52,082
but this is something I really need to do.

406
00:23:52,082 --> 00:23:53,564
Huh, suit yourself.

407
00:23:53,564 --> 00:23:56,944
Hey, how'd you know my name is Applejack?

408
00:23:57,557 --> 00:23:58,957
Um, I uh...

409
00:23:59,724 --> 00:24:00,478
Didn't you say?

410
00:24:01,078 --> 00:24:02,657
Nnnope.

411
00:24:02,973 --> 00:24:05,294
Well, it sure was nice meeting you both.

412
00:24:05,294 --> 00:24:06,823
I'm sure I'll be seeing you around.

413
00:24:08,492 --> 00:24:10,586
That one's trying to hide a secret,

414
00:24:10,586 --> 00:24:12,686
but I am totally on to her.

415
00:24:13,594 --> 00:24:15,469
She's psychic!

416
00:24:15,923 --> 00:24:18,187
Uh-huh. If you say so.

417
00:24:19,664 --> 00:24:21,950
This looks terrible!

418
00:24:23,407 --> 00:24:26,477
There should be more streamers near the stage and fewer balloons.

419
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:29,801
Yeah, streamers!

420
00:24:30,431 --> 00:24:32,360
And fewer balloons!

421
00:24:34,011 --> 00:24:35,707
Fizzy apple cider?

422
00:24:35,707 --> 00:24:36,569
Ugh!

423
00:24:36,569 --> 00:24:38,917
This is my coronation, not a hoedown.

424
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:41,159
Well, now,

425
00:24:41,159 --> 00:24:45,679
it ain't necessarily gonna be your coronation this time around.

426
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:47,891
Oh, is that so?

427
00:24:47,891 --> 00:24:50,732
You country folk really aren't that bright.

428
00:24:50,732 --> 00:24:54,395
Must be why the other students say such awful things about you.

429
00:24:56,791 --> 00:24:59,403
Obviously it's gonna be MY coronation.

430
00:24:59,403 --> 00:25:01,542
I'm running unopposed.

431
00:25:01,542 --> 00:25:03,244
Not this time.

432
00:25:03,244 --> 00:25:05,053
The new girl just signed up!

433
00:25:05,247 --> 00:25:05,892
What?!

434
00:25:07,189 --> 00:25:10,023
I know, her handwriting is really bad.

435
00:25:10,728 --> 00:25:13,433
Where is this Twilight Sparkle?

436
00:25:16,389 --> 00:25:19,578
I'm look forward to meeting the competition!

437
00:25:32,782 --> 00:25:35,259
Can't believe I didn't recognize you earlier.

438
00:25:36,675 --> 00:25:37,258
Should've known

439
00:25:37,258 --> 00:25:41,065
Princess Celestia would send her prized pupil here after my crown,

440
00:25:41,065 --> 00:25:42,667
and her little dog, too.

441
00:25:42,667 --> 00:25:44,750
It's my crown!

442
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:45,866
Whatever.

443
00:25:45,866 --> 00:25:47,924
This is just a minor setback for me.

444
00:25:47,924 --> 00:25:49,979
You don't know the first thing about this place,

445
00:25:49,979 --> 00:25:52,407
and I already rule it.

446
00:25:52,407 --> 00:25:54,738
If that's so, why do you even need my crown?

447
00:25:54,738 --> 00:25:58,569
You went to an awful lot of trouble to switch it with the one that belongs here.

448
00:25:58,569 --> 00:26:02,065
Pop quiz: what happens when you bring an Element of Harmony

449
00:26:02,065 --> 00:26:03,347
into an alternate world?

450
00:26:04,652 --> 00:26:05,930
You don't know?

451
00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:07,329
Seriously?

452
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:12,599
And you're supposed to be Princess Celestia's star student?

453
00:26:14,091 --> 00:26:17,749
Then again, what were the chances she'd find somepony as bright as me

454
00:26:17,749 --> 00:26:20,815
to take under her wing after I decided to leave Equestria?

455
00:26:21,157 --> 00:26:24,484
Bit embarrassing that you were the best she could do.

456
00:26:25,815 --> 00:26:28,944
Oh, and I'd keep an eye on your mutt.

457
00:26:28,944 --> 00:26:31,805
Hate for him to be taken away from you.

458
00:26:31,997 --> 00:26:33,878
Is that a threat?

459
00:26:33,878 --> 00:26:35,963
Oh, of course not.

460
00:26:36,927 --> 00:26:40,189
But I'd cut down on the chatter if I were you.

461
00:26:40,189 --> 00:26:44,078
Don't want everyone to know you don't belong here, now would you?

462
00:26:44,078 --> 00:26:46,450
You want to be a princess here?

463
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:47,525
Please.

464
00:26:48,769 --> 00:26:51,308
You don't know the first thing about fitting in.

465
00:27:04,606 --> 00:27:06,367
I want you to follow her.

466
00:27:06,367 --> 00:27:07,893
Bring me something I can use

467
00:27:07,893 --> 00:27:09,727
just like I did with that last girl

468
00:27:09,727 --> 00:27:11,342
who thought she could challenge me.

469
00:27:11,342 --> 00:27:13,855
You got it, Sunset Shimmer.

470
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,893
When the crown and its power are mine,

471
00:27:16,893 --> 00:27:20,785
Twilight Sparkle will be sorry she ever set hoof into this' world.

472
00:27:20,785 --> 00:27:24,326
Not that she would've been much safer if she stayed in Equestria.

473
00:27:25,505 --> 00:27:28,028
Yeah, in Equestria.

474
00:27:28,373 --> 00:27:29,937
What are you still doing here?

475
00:27:29,937 --> 00:27:30,815
Go!

476
00:27:55,527 --> 00:27:56,757
Excuse me.

477
00:27:57,810 --> 00:28:01,070
The Great and Powerful Trixie!

478
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,096
Needs some peanut butter crackers.

479
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:08,398
Voila!

480
00:28:11,091 --> 00:28:12,615
Sunset Shimmer is right.

481
00:28:13,099 --> 00:28:15,104
I don't know the first thing about this place.

482
00:28:15,441 --> 00:28:17,385
If I'm gonna really fit in and win votes,

483
00:28:17,385 --> 00:28:19,209
we need to do some research.

484
00:28:20,021 --> 00:28:20,973
Research?

485
00:28:21,204 --> 00:28:22,610
This place has a school.

486
00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:24,183
I have to believe it's got a...

487
00:28:24,889 --> 00:28:26,197
library!

488
00:28:29,519 --> 00:28:30,675
Got your phone?

489
00:28:32,036 --> 00:28:33,010
Got yours?

490
00:28:45,059 --> 00:28:45,943
So,

491
00:28:45,943 --> 00:28:48,092
I just push the letters here

492
00:28:48,528 --> 00:28:52,103
and then the words and moving pictures will come up here?

493
00:28:56,162 --> 00:28:57,424
That's right.

494
00:28:59,491 --> 00:29:02,020
Maybe this place does have magic.

495
00:29:10,522 --> 00:29:12,815
<i>«When you're a younger...»</i>

496
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:15,789
Uh, girls, what are you doing?

497
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:19,071
We're just seeing how many hits our new music video has gotten.

498
00:29:19,706 --> 00:29:22,578
<i>«So the three of us will fight the fight...»</i>

499
00:29:23,075 --> 00:29:24,195
No, just...

500
00:29:25,084 --> 00:29:26,050
No.

501
00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:29,504
The school computers are for research purposes only.

502
00:29:29,921 --> 00:29:31,519
It's just as well, y'all.

503
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:34,364
Some of the comments about our song were really awful:

504
00:29:34,678 --> 00:29:35,815
"Epic Fail",

505
00:29:36,409 --> 00:29:38,095
"Funniest thing I've ever seen!"

506
00:29:38,456 --> 00:29:40,990
Funniest thing they've ever seen, huh?

507
00:29:42,147 --> 00:29:45,316
Uh, I don't know that that's what you should take from...

508
00:30:34,424 --> 00:30:37,448
The library will be closing in five minutes.

509
00:30:40,262 --> 00:30:43,152
I hadn't even thought about where we're going to sleep tonight!

510
00:30:44,913 --> 00:30:46,018
Way ahead of you.

511
00:30:50,441 --> 00:30:51,454
It's a little...

512
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:52,722
dusty.

513
00:30:52,722 --> 00:30:55,280
But it doesn't seem like anybody comes up here.

514
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:58,498
It's perfect, Spike.

515
00:31:03,248 --> 00:31:05,110
So, how did your research go?

516
00:31:05,229 --> 00:31:06,237
I found this book.

517
00:31:06,533 --> 00:31:08,256
It's called a yearbook.

518
00:31:08,256 --> 00:31:11,070
It seems to be something they use to keep a record of things

519
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:12,440
that have happened at the school.

520
00:31:12,698 --> 00:31:13,588
Look.

521
00:31:13,667 --> 00:31:15,090
That's Pinkie Pie,

522
00:31:15,090 --> 00:31:15,942
Rainbow Dash,

523
00:31:15,942 --> 00:31:16,617
Applejack,

524
00:31:16,872 --> 00:31:18,028
Fluttershy,

525
00:31:18,028 --> 00:31:20,794
and I'm gonna bet the girl on the far right is Rarity.

526
00:31:21,073 --> 00:31:22,320
There's a Rarity here!?

527
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,209
Uh, I mean, uh...

528
00:31:24,904 --> 00:31:25,955
interesting photo!

529
00:31:26,272 --> 00:31:29,431
It's interesting because they look like they're friends.

530
00:31:29,431 --> 00:31:30,927
They do look like our friends.

531
00:31:30,927 --> 00:31:33,389
But I thought we figured that out already.

532
00:31:33,389 --> 00:31:34,694
No, I mean...

533
00:31:34,694 --> 00:31:36,886
they look like they're friends with each other.

534
00:31:37,749 --> 00:31:39,884
But it doesn't seem like they're friends now.

535
00:31:40,355 --> 00:31:41,758
Not so much.

536
00:31:42,044 --> 00:31:43,662
I just can't help but get the feeling

537
00:31:43,662 --> 00:31:45,956
that Sunset Shimmer had something to do with it.

538
00:31:46,531 --> 00:31:48,060
I wouldn't put it past her.

539
00:31:49,119 --> 00:31:50,520
But she wanted your crown

540
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:52,347
'cause she's planning on doing something even worse!

541
00:31:53,432 --> 00:31:54,399
If you're gonna stop her,

542
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:56,625
you have to focus on making friends here.

543
00:31:56,625 --> 00:31:59,034
Can't worry about why these girls aren't friends anymore.

544
00:31:59,428 --> 00:32:03,922
Even if they do remind you of your Ponyville friends.

545
00:32:04,585 --> 00:32:05,855
You're right, Spike.

546
00:32:07,094 --> 00:32:08,598
Eye on the prize.

547
00:32:13,182 --> 00:32:15,350
Good morning, students, and happy Thursday.

548
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:17,017
Just a reminder to pick up your ballots

549
00:32:17,017 --> 00:32:19,059
for the Princess of the Fall Formal today.

550
00:32:19,147 --> 00:32:21,388
They are due at the time the dance starts tomorrow night,

551
00:32:21,388 --> 00:32:23,781
so don't forget to turn them in and make your voice heard.

552
00:32:24,177 --> 00:32:26,740
Fluttershy said I'd need to win over all those different groups

553
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:28,851
if I want to become Princess of the Fall Formal.

554
00:32:28,851 --> 00:32:31,020
So I've compiled a list of talking points.

555
00:32:32,537 --> 00:32:33,688
You made a list?

556
00:32:34,153 --> 00:32:35,488
That's so unlike you!

557
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:41,446
Please. Continue.

558
00:32:41,716 --> 00:32:43,165
I'll start introducing myself.

559
00:32:43,165 --> 00:32:46,777
Sprinkle in some things I learned about their world into the conversation,

560
00:32:46,777 --> 00:32:48,638
show them how I fit in here!

561
00:32:52,039 --> 00:32:53,254
Okay, Spike.

562
00:32:53,436 --> 00:32:56,053
Time to make a good first impression on my fellow students.

563
00:32:59,345 --> 00:33:01,502
The whole world sort of depends on it.

564
00:33:02,289 --> 00:33:03,604
Hey, look.

565
00:33:11,313 --> 00:33:13,241
Why is everybody looking at me funny?

566
00:33:15,069 --> 00:33:15,779
What're you...?

567
00:33:15,979 --> 00:33:17,799
Why did you...?

568
00:33:17,873 --> 00:33:18,678
Rarity?

569
00:33:25,658 --> 00:33:26,358
Perfect!

570
00:33:28,093 --> 00:33:30,673
Oh, yes. This is good!

571
00:33:30,673 --> 00:33:32,213
No one will recognize you!

572
00:33:32,213 --> 00:33:33,862
Why wouldn't I want to be...?

573
00:33:33,862 --> 00:33:36,980
And we'll need a disguise for your dog, which is too bad.

574
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:39,884
He really is so adorable!

575
00:33:40,563 --> 00:33:41,631
You know, with a little work,

576
00:33:41,631 --> 00:33:43,359
I think I could make it look like a rabbit, instead.

577
00:33:44,381 --> 00:33:45,491
A rabbit?

578
00:33:45,839 --> 00:33:47,659
There you are, Twilight.

579
00:33:48,083 --> 00:33:49,581
So much for the disguise.

580
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:51,658
I've been lookin' all over for ya!

581
00:33:51,658 --> 00:33:52,774
Me too.

582
00:33:52,774 --> 00:33:54,044
Me three!

583
00:33:55,466 --> 00:33:56,638
I like your new look!

584
00:33:56,638 --> 00:33:59,153
I do have an eye for these sorts of things.

585
00:33:59,153 --> 00:34:00,601
Not that you seem to care.

586
00:34:00,601 --> 00:34:01,350
WHAT?!?

587
00:34:01,744 --> 00:34:03,260
Why do you think she doesn't care?

588
00:34:05,035 --> 00:34:06,448
No, never mind.

589
00:34:06,448 --> 00:34:08,094
Why were you all looking for me?

590
00:34:08,094 --> 00:34:09,092
What's going on?

591
00:34:09,414 --> 00:34:11,765
Oh, she hasn't seen it yet.

592
00:34:12,172 --> 00:34:13,269
Seen what?

593
00:34:15,792 --> 00:34:17,671
Oh, it's really not that bad.

594
00:34:18,682 --> 00:34:22,326
Twilight Sparkle wants to be your Fall Formal Princess.

595
00:34:24,812 --> 00:34:29,494
What does it say about our school if we give someone like this...

596
00:34:31,489 --> 00:34:33,774
such an important honor?

597
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,160
Wha... I?

598
00:34:38,612 --> 00:34:39,913
I take that back.

599
00:34:39,913 --> 00:34:41,283
It's pretty bad!

600
00:34:41,456 --> 00:34:43,341
But this all happened yesterday!

601
00:34:43,341 --> 00:34:44,784
At the library!

602
00:34:44,784 --> 00:34:47,486
Has everyone in the school seen this?

603
00:34:47,486 --> 00:34:49,940
Is that why they were all looking at me that way?

604
00:34:51,812 --> 00:34:53,325
What am I gonna do?

605
00:34:53,325 --> 00:34:55,776
No one is gonna vote for me after seeing this!

606
00:34:55,923 --> 00:34:57,788
Not that it'll make any difference,

607
00:34:57,788 --> 00:34:59,474
but I'll still vote for you.

608
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:02,000
You were so nice to stand up for me

609
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,495
when Sunset Shimmer was picking on me yesterday.

610
00:35:05,191 --> 00:35:06,492
If you still wanna run,

611
00:35:06,492 --> 00:35:08,129
maybe there's something I can do to help!

612
00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:10,999
Word of advice: Don't accept her help.

613
00:35:10,999 --> 00:35:13,512
She doesn't take anything seriously!

614
00:35:13,512 --> 00:35:16,294
Ugh! Why do you have to be so awful to me?

615
00:35:17,574 --> 00:35:19,528
Don't play innocent, Pinkie Pie!

616
00:35:19,528 --> 00:35:21,445
You are no better than she is!

617
00:35:21,445 --> 00:35:24,143
And WHAT is that supposed to mean?

618
00:35:24,378 --> 00:35:27,761
I am happy to offer up my assistance as well.

619
00:35:27,761 --> 00:35:31,209
To someone who would APPRECIATE what I have to offer!

620
00:35:38,007 --> 00:35:39,475
Listen to y'all carryin' on!

621
00:35:39,475 --> 00:35:41,083
Get over it and move on!

622
00:35:41,603 --> 00:35:45,431
You mean like how you've gotten over what happened with Rainbow Dash?

623
00:35:45,802 --> 00:35:49,132
She said she'd get the softball team to make an appearance at my bake sale.

624
00:35:49,132 --> 00:35:52,584
I tell everybody they're comin', and then not one of them shows up!

625
00:35:52,584 --> 00:35:54,010
She made a liar outta me!

626
00:35:54,010 --> 00:35:55,356
That's different!

627
00:35:55,356 --> 00:35:56,626
Is not!

628
00:35:56,626 --> 00:35:57,643
Is too!

629
00:36:04,172 --> 00:36:05,649
STOP!

630
00:36:05,649 --> 00:36:07,004
All of you!

631
00:36:07,601 --> 00:36:08,906
I wanna show you something.

632
00:36:10,525 --> 00:36:11,995
You were friends once.

633
00:36:14,454 --> 00:36:15,675
The Freshman Fair.

634
00:36:16,009 --> 00:36:17,014
Y'all remember?

635
00:36:17,318 --> 00:36:18,512
Yes.

636
00:36:18,695 --> 00:36:19,967
But something happened.

637
00:36:19,967 --> 00:36:22,354
I think that something was Sunset Shimmer.

638
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:24,635
Well, it's a nice theory, darling,

639
00:36:24,635 --> 00:36:26,959
but Sunset Shimmer had nothing to do with it.

640
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:28,353
She's right.

641
00:36:28,353 --> 00:36:29,863
Sunset Shimmer isn't the one

642
00:36:29,863 --> 00:36:31,913
who ruined my silent auction for the animal shelter

643
00:36:31,913 --> 00:36:33,934
by bringing fireworks and noisemakers!

644
00:36:34,683 --> 00:36:36,759
It was supposed to be a serious event,

645
00:36:36,759 --> 00:36:38,916
but Pinkie Pie ruined it!

646
00:36:38,916 --> 00:36:40,538
What are you talking about?

647
00:36:40,538 --> 00:36:43,349
I got a text from you saying that you didn't want a silent auction,

648
00:36:43,349 --> 00:36:45,311
you wanted a big party!

649
00:36:45,965 --> 00:36:47,988
I never sent you a text!

650
00:36:47,988 --> 00:36:48,988
You didn't?

651
00:36:49,189 --> 00:36:51,999
You don't think she's the one who's been sending me those e-mails, do you?

652
00:36:51,999 --> 00:36:54,928
Every time I volunteer to help with the decorations at a school function,

653
00:36:54,928 --> 00:36:58,519
I get an e-mail from Pinkie Pie saying she has plenty of volunteers!

654
00:36:58,519 --> 00:37:01,726
And then I find out she's done everything herself.

655
00:37:01,969 --> 00:37:04,262
I never sent you any e-mails!

656
00:37:04,788 --> 00:37:08,403
Maybe she's the reason Rainbow Dash didn't show up for my bake sale!

657
00:37:08,673 --> 00:37:11,673
Didn't you ever ask Rainbow Dash why she didn't show up?

658
00:37:12,047 --> 00:37:15,515
Heh, I guess I kinda stopped talking to her at all after that.

659
00:37:16,188 --> 00:37:18,547
Maybe now would be a good time to start.

660
00:37:28,204 --> 00:37:29,802
They're actually talking!

661
00:37:29,802 --> 00:37:31,040
That's a good sign!

662
00:37:36,471 --> 00:37:37,374
Hugs!

663
00:37:37,374 --> 00:37:38,970
Ooh, hugs are always good!

664
00:37:39,289 --> 00:37:42,590
Somebody, and I think we can all guess who,

665
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:46,164
told Rainbow Dash that my bake sale had been moved to a different day.

666
00:37:46,164 --> 00:37:49,969
Dash showed up with all the softball team and thought I'd cancelled on her!

667
00:37:49,969 --> 00:37:52,312
So you're looking to dethrone Sunset Shimmer

668
00:37:52,312 --> 00:37:54,860
and become Princess of the Fall Formal, huh?

669
00:37:56,451 --> 00:37:59,846
Gotta say, I'd really love to see that happen.

670
00:37:59,846 --> 00:38:01,297
I'll totally help you out!

671
00:38:01,297 --> 00:38:05,124
All you gotta do is beat me in a game of one-on-one.

672
00:38:05,124 --> 00:38:05,925
What?

673
00:38:06,386 --> 00:38:08,249
First to five goals wins.

674
00:38:09,814 --> 00:38:10,950
One-zip!

675
00:39:05,322 --> 00:39:06,578
That's game!

676
00:39:08,119 --> 00:39:12,430
I... really thought you were gonna... pull it off there in the end!

677
00:39:14,808 --> 00:39:16,234
So what's the plan?

678
00:39:16,234 --> 00:39:18,742
How can I help you be princess instead of Sunset Shimmer?

679
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:19,975
But...

680
00:39:20,518 --> 00:39:21,174
I...

681
00:39:21,636 --> 00:39:22,756
lost!

682
00:39:23,104 --> 00:39:24,729
Of course you lost.

683
00:39:24,729 --> 00:39:25,565
I'm awesome!

684
00:39:25,565 --> 00:39:28,868
But I'm not going to ask just anyone to try and beat Sunset Shimmer.

685
00:39:28,868 --> 00:39:33,333
The Fall Formal Princess should be someone with heart and determination.

686
00:39:33,333 --> 00:39:35,124
You've proved that you've got 'em both!

687
00:39:50,652 --> 00:39:52,948
And... could I get mine with extra oats?

688
00:39:53,383 --> 00:39:54,436
Oats?

689
00:39:54,988 --> 00:39:56,548
Uh, scratch that.

690
00:39:56,548 --> 00:39:58,742
However you normally make it is fine.

691
00:40:07,245 --> 00:40:10,501
Oh! We've got to stop bumping into each other like this.

692
00:40:13,904 --> 00:40:15,163
You know me!

693
00:40:15,646 --> 00:40:18,490
Always trying to make a big splash around here.

694
00:40:18,768 --> 00:40:20,694
'Cause my drink kinda splashed...

695
00:40:20,953 --> 00:40:21,964
on the ground.

696
00:40:26,479 --> 00:40:28,111
I'm gonna go over there now.

697
00:40:32,878 --> 00:40:35,087
Don't even think about it!

698
00:40:35,087 --> 00:40:37,247
You're already trying to get a crown.

699
00:40:37,247 --> 00:40:38,996
Who knows what Sunset Shimmer would do

700
00:40:38,996 --> 00:40:41,192
if you ended up getting her ex-boyfriend too?

701
00:40:41,311 --> 00:40:43,742
I'm not trying to, I don't even know...

702
00:40:43,742 --> 00:40:45,032
We just accidentally...

703
00:40:45,032 --> 00:40:46,414
Ex-boyfriend?

704
00:40:46,771 --> 00:40:49,597
Flash Sentry broke up with her a few weeks ago.

705
00:40:49,597 --> 00:40:52,714
I can't believe she hasn't done something awful to him yet.

706
00:40:57,598 --> 00:41:01,724
Maybe she's just waiting until she has the power to do something really awful.

707
00:41:02,008 --> 00:41:03,252
All right, girls.

708
00:41:03,252 --> 00:41:05,353
Dance is tomorrow night and we still don't know how

709
00:41:05,353 --> 00:41:07,991
we're gonna get Twilight the vote she needs to be named princess.

710
00:41:07,991 --> 00:41:10,111
Right now, folks only know the Twilight

711
00:41:10,111 --> 00:41:12,327
from the videos Sunset Shimmer posted online.

712
00:41:12,790 --> 00:41:14,963
We need to help them see her differently.

713
00:41:17,404 --> 00:41:18,550
I'VE GOT IT!

714
00:41:23,304 --> 00:41:26,134
I mean, um, perhaps I have a solution.

715
00:41:26,241 --> 00:41:28,858
Now this may be an absolutely preposterous idea, but

716
00:41:28,858 --> 00:41:32,682
what if we all wore these as a sign of unity?

717
00:41:33,805 --> 00:41:35,919
Freshman year, they were very, very popular.

718
00:41:35,919 --> 00:41:37,891
A way for everybody to show their school spirit!

719
00:41:37,891 --> 00:41:38,628
You know?

720
00:41:38,628 --> 00:41:40,286
"Go, Canterlot Wondercolts!"

721
00:41:42,256 --> 00:41:43,711
I haven't sold any in ages.

722
00:41:44,209 --> 00:41:47,207
I mean, the five of us are obviously very different,

723
00:41:47,207 --> 00:41:49,770
but deep down, we're all Canterlot Wondercolts!

724
00:41:50,270 --> 00:41:52,490
Sunset Shimmer is the one who divided us,

725
00:41:52,490 --> 00:41:55,034
Twilight Sparkle is the one who united us.

726
00:41:55,034 --> 00:41:57,125
And we're gonna let everyone know it!

727
00:41:58,455 --> 00:41:59,776
What do you think?

728
00:42:59,409 --> 00:43:02,342
<i>Hey! Hey! Everybody!</i>

729
00:43:02,342 --> 00:43:04,452
<i>We've got something to say.</i>

730
00:43:04,452 --> 00:43:07,235
<i>We may seem as different,</i>

731
00:43:07,235 --> 00:43:09,429
<i>As the night is from day.</i>

732
00:43:09,429 --> 00:43:12,015
<i>But you look a little deeper,</i>

733
00:43:12,015 --> 00:43:13,811
<i>And you will see:</i>

734
00:43:13,811 --> 00:43:16,210
<i>That I'm just like you</i>

735
00:43:16,210 --> 00:43:18,356
<i>And you're just like me.</i>

736
00:43:18,356 --> 00:43:18,923
<i>Yeah!</i>

737
00:43:23,862 --> 00:43:26,348
<i>Hey! Hey! Everybody!</i>

738
00:43:26,348 --> 00:43:27,709
<i>We're here to shout,</i>

739
00:43:27,709 --> 00:43:30,043
<i>That the magic of friendship</i>

740
00:43:30,043 --> 00:43:31,858
<i>Is what it's all about.</i>

741
00:43:31,858 --> 00:43:34,284
<i>Yeah, we thought we were different,</i>

742
00:43:34,284 --> 00:43:36,143
<i>As the night is from the day.</i>

743
00:43:36,143 --> 00:43:38,482
<i>Until Twilight Sparkle</i>

744
00:43:38,482 --> 00:43:40,309
<i>Helped us see another way.</i>

745
00:43:40,309 --> 00:43:42,605
<i>So get up, get down.</i>

746
00:43:42,605 --> 00:43:44,743
<i>If you're gonna come around.</i>

747
00:43:44,743 --> 00:43:47,082
<i>We can work together,</i>

748
00:43:47,082 --> 00:43:49,025
<i>Helping Twilight win the crown.</i>

749
00:43:49,025 --> 00:43:51,137
<i>So get up, get down.</i>

750
00:43:51,137 --> 00:43:53,276
<i>'Cause it's gonna make a sound.</i>

751
00:43:53,276 --> 00:43:55,548
<i>If we work together,</i>

752
00:43:55,548 --> 00:43:58,082
<i>Helping Twilight Sparkle win the crown.</i>

753
00:43:58,082 --> 00:44:00,340
<i>Hey! Hey! Hands up now!</i>

754
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:02,499
<i>We're sending a message to the crowd!</i>

755
00:44:02,499 --> 00:44:04,493
<i>Hands way up, then come down,</i>

756
00:44:04,493 --> 00:44:06,712
<i>We party together all around!</i>

757
00:44:06,712 --> 00:44:07,855
<i>Generous,</i>

758
00:44:07,855 --> 00:44:08,888
<i>Honesty.</i>

759
00:44:08,888 --> 00:44:09,538
<i>Laughter,</i>

760
00:44:09,538 --> 00:44:10,148
<i>Kindness,</i>

761
00:44:10,148 --> 00:44:10,915
<i>Loyalty.</i>

762
00:44:10,915 --> 00:44:13,056
<i>Twilight helped us each to see.</i>

763
00:44:13,056 --> 00:44:14,940
<i>All that we can be. So</i>

764
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:17,031
<i>Get up, get down.</i>

765
00:44:17,031 --> 00:44:18,898
<i>If you're gonna come around.</i>

766
00:44:18,898 --> 00:44:21,310
<i>We can work together,</i>

767
00:44:21,310 --> 00:44:23,295
<i>Helping Twilight win the crown.</i>

768
00:44:23,295 --> 00:44:25,521
<i>So get up, get down.</i>

769
00:44:25,521 --> 00:44:27,595
<i>'Cause it's gonna make a sound.</i>

770
00:44:27,595 --> 00:44:29,873
<i>If we work together,</i>

771
00:44:29,873 --> 00:44:32,499
<i>Helping Twilight Sparkle win the crown.</i>

772
00:44:32,499 --> 00:44:34,801
<i>I'm gonna be myself</i>

773
00:44:34,801 --> 00:44:37,044
<i>No matter what I do.</i>

774
00:44:37,044 --> 00:44:38,770
<i>And if we're different, yeah,</i>

775
00:44:38,770 --> 00:44:41,251
<i>I want you to be true to you.</i>

776
00:44:41,251 --> 00:44:43,145
<i>If you follow me,</i>

777
00:44:43,145 --> 00:44:45,655
<i>We'll put our differences aside.</i>

778
00:44:45,655 --> 00:44:47,229
<i>We'll stick together and</i>

779
00:44:47,229 --> 00:44:51,032
<i>Start working on that school pride!</i>

780
00:44:51,032 --> 00:44:53,835
<i>Jump up, make a sound. Hey!</i>

781
00:44:53,835 --> 00:44:56,100
<i>Stomp your hooves, turn around.</i>

782
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:58,205
<i>Start now, make a change,</i>

783
00:44:58,205 --> 00:44:59,845
<i>Gonna come around.</i>

784
00:44:59,845 --> 00:45:02,455
<i>Jump up, make a sound. Hey!</i>

785
00:45:02,455 --> 00:45:04,617
<i>Stomp your hooves, turn around.</i>

786
00:45:04,617 --> 00:45:06,755
<i>Canterlot Wondercolts</i>

787
00:45:06,755 --> 00:45:08,304
<i>Help her win the crown.</i>

788
00:45:08,304 --> 00:45:11,040
<i>Jump up, make a sound. Hey!</i>

789
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:13,222
<i>Stomp your hooves, turn around.</i>

790
00:45:13,222 --> 00:45:15,302
<i>Start now, make a change,</i>

791
00:45:15,302 --> 00:45:16,990
<i>Gonna come around.</i>

792
00:45:16,990 --> 00:45:19,582
<i>Jump up, make a sound. Hey!</i>

793
00:45:19,582 --> 00:45:21,811
<i>Stomp your hooves, turn around.</i>

794
00:45:21,811 --> 00:45:23,893
<i>Canterlot Wondercolts</i>

795
00:45:23,893 --> 00:45:25,355
<i>Help her win the crown.</i>

796
00:45:25,355 --> 00:45:28,300
<i>Jump up, make a sound. Hey!</i>

797
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:30,358
<i>Stomp your hooves, turn around.</i>

798
00:45:30,358 --> 00:45:32,532
<i>Start now, make a change,</i>

799
00:45:32,532 --> 00:45:34,150
<i>Gonna come around.</i>

800
00:45:38,593 --> 00:45:40,365
Take those off!

801
00:45:40,897 --> 00:45:43,406
I have something I need you to do.

802
00:45:56,714 --> 00:45:58,681
Doesn't everyone look just fabulous?

803
00:45:58,681 --> 00:46:00,921
It was a great idea, Rarity!

804
00:46:02,798 --> 00:46:04,503
Don't know what she's smilin' about.

805
00:46:04,771 --> 00:46:07,785
Twilight's the one that's gonna be princess of the Fall Formal.

806
00:46:14,596 --> 00:46:15,998
Vice-Principal Luna!

807
00:46:15,998 --> 00:46:18,098
Something terrible has happened!

808
00:46:22,011 --> 00:46:23,863
Isn't this just awful?

809
00:46:24,090 --> 00:46:28,323
And after Pinkie Pie worked so hard to make things so perfect!

810
00:46:28,477 --> 00:46:32,157
Why would Twilight Sparkle do something like this?

811
00:46:32,157 --> 00:46:35,377
Why would you think Twilight was responsible for something like this?

812
00:46:35,753 --> 00:46:37,282
Because I have proof.

813
00:46:43,528 --> 00:46:44,459
But...

814
00:46:45,005 --> 00:46:46,080
I don't understand!

815
00:46:46,431 --> 00:46:49,566
This is clearly you in the photographs, is it not?

816
00:46:53,711 --> 00:46:54,888
Yes, but...

817
00:46:55,031 --> 00:46:56,789
I think it should be fairly obvious

818
00:46:56,789 --> 00:46:59,539
that the school cannot let someone who would do something like this

819
00:46:59,539 --> 00:47:01,631
compete for the Fall Formal crown.

820
00:47:06,603 --> 00:47:07,725
Vice-Principal Luna.

821
00:47:08,356 --> 00:47:10,340
I found these in the trash can in the library.

822
00:47:10,675 --> 00:47:11,947
Thought you should see them.

823
00:47:13,126 --> 00:47:16,071
Someone obviously combined these photos to make it look

824
00:47:16,071 --> 00:47:18,142
like Twilight was the one who trashed the gym.

825
00:47:18,142 --> 00:47:21,143
I appreciate you bringing these to my attention, Flash.

826
00:47:22,288 --> 00:47:26,044
In light of this new evidence, you may of course continue your bid

827
00:47:26,044 --> 00:47:28,625
to be crowned the princess of the Fall Formal.

828
00:47:29,003 --> 00:47:29,860
Thank you!

829
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:32,670
You have no idea how important this is to me!

830
00:47:34,007 --> 00:47:35,565
What was I gonna do?

831
00:47:35,565 --> 00:47:37,049
Not prove your innocence?

832
00:47:37,049 --> 00:47:39,715
Wouldn't be much of a Canterlot Wondercolt, would I?

833
00:47:39,715 --> 00:47:42,680
I am afraid enough damage has been done to the gym

834
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:45,878
that we will have to postpone the dance until tomorrow night.

835
00:47:45,878 --> 00:47:47,467
If you will excuse me,

836
00:47:47,467 --> 00:47:50,765
I need to let my sister know about this latest development.

837
00:47:52,011 --> 00:47:53,946
So, uh, I was wondering.

838
00:47:53,946 --> 00:47:56,247
If you aren't already going with somebody,

839
00:47:56,247 --> 00:47:58,882
wanna go to the Fall Formal with me tomorrow night?

840
00:48:01,353 --> 00:48:02,592
That would be...

841
00:48:02,910 --> 00:48:04,194
Tomorrow night!?

842
00:48:04,194 --> 00:48:07,338
No, no no no no no, no no no no no!

843
00:48:07,338 --> 00:48:07,895
I can't!

844
00:48:07,895 --> 00:48:08,609
The portal!

845
00:48:08,609 --> 00:48:09,477
That'll be too late!

846
00:48:11,064 --> 00:48:12,923
One "no" would have been fine!

847
00:48:23,403 --> 00:48:24,934
Everything okay in there?

848
00:48:25,166 --> 00:48:25,850
Yes!

849
00:48:26,156 --> 00:48:27,777
Only it's not okay.

850
00:48:27,777 --> 00:48:29,126
It's not okay at all!

851
00:48:29,126 --> 00:48:30,873
If I don't get my crown tonight,

852
00:48:30,873 --> 00:48:32,685
I won't be able to go back to Equestria

853
00:48:32,685 --> 00:48:34,243
for another thirty moons!

854
00:48:34,243 --> 00:48:36,794
Oh, what are we gonna do?

855
00:48:38,820 --> 00:48:40,299
We tell them the truth.

856
00:48:40,299 --> 00:48:42,330
Let them know what's really at stake

857
00:48:42,330 --> 00:48:43,633
if you don't get the crown tonight.

858
00:48:43,633 --> 00:48:45,375
They'll help us figure something out.

859
00:48:45,518 --> 00:48:46,948
What if they won't?

860
00:48:46,948 --> 00:48:50,088
What if when they find out how different I really am...?

861
00:48:51,651 --> 00:48:54,218
Twilight, these girls rallied around you

862
00:48:54,218 --> 00:48:55,994
'cause they saw what was in your heart!

863
00:48:55,994 --> 00:48:57,711
They aren't going to feel any differently about you

864
00:48:57,711 --> 00:49:00,361
when they find out you're a pony princess in Equestria.

865
00:49:02,835 --> 00:49:04,900
I'm glad you followed me here, Spike.

866
00:49:05,362 --> 00:49:06,074
Me too.

867
00:49:06,074 --> 00:49:09,412
Unless of course we get stuck here for another thirty moons.

868
00:49:11,739 --> 00:49:12,695
You okay?

869
00:49:13,181 --> 00:49:15,485
The Fall Formal isn't happening tonight.

870
00:49:15,485 --> 00:49:16,664
WHAT!?

871
00:49:16,664 --> 00:49:18,106
It had to be postponed

872
00:49:18,106 --> 00:49:19,915
because Sunset Shimmer had Snips and Snails

873
00:49:19,915 --> 00:49:22,080
ruin all of Pinkie Pie's decorations.

874
00:49:22,183 --> 00:49:23,322
WHAT?!?

875
00:49:23,322 --> 00:49:26,086
But the Fall Formal has to happen tonight.

876
00:49:26,086 --> 00:49:26,719
Wha...

877
00:49:31,433 --> 00:49:32,652
You see...

878
00:49:33,721 --> 00:49:35,881
You're from an alternate world and you're a pony princess there

879
00:49:35,881 --> 00:49:37,655
and the crown actually has a magical element

880
00:49:37,655 --> 00:49:39,704
embedded in it that helps power up other magical elements

881
00:49:39,704 --> 00:49:40,828
and without it they don't work anymore,

882
00:49:40,828 --> 00:49:42,348
and you need them all to help protect your magical world,

883
00:49:42,348 --> 00:49:43,675
and if you don't get the crown tonight,

884
00:49:43,675 --> 00:49:44,844
you'll be stuck in this world

885
00:49:44,844 --> 00:49:46,009
and you won't be able to get back for like

886
00:49:46,009 --> 00:49:47,451
a really, really long time!

887
00:49:51,723 --> 00:49:55,291
Yeah, I'm pretty sure that isn't the reason.

888
00:49:55,291 --> 00:49:57,195
Nope, she's pretty much spot-on.

889
00:49:57,195 --> 00:49:58,406
He can talk!?

890
00:49:58,749 --> 00:50:01,083
Yeah, and back where I come from,

891
00:50:01,083 --> 00:50:02,205
I'm not even a dog!

892
00:50:02,205 --> 00:50:05,959
I'm a ferocious, fire-breathing dragon!

893
00:50:06,730 --> 00:50:08,853
This is so amazing!

894
00:50:08,853 --> 00:50:11,012
Tell me, what are you thinking right now?

895
00:50:14,615 --> 00:50:17,415
Sure would love a scratch behind the old ears!

896
00:50:18,641 --> 00:50:19,934
Uh, maybe later.

897
00:50:20,277 --> 00:50:21,728
How did you know all that?

898
00:50:21,815 --> 00:50:22,896
Just a hunch.

899
00:50:22,896 --> 00:50:24,344
Wait a minute!

900
00:50:24,344 --> 00:50:25,722
Let me get this straight.

901
00:50:25,722 --> 00:50:27,593
You're a pony?

902
00:50:27,593 --> 00:50:29,601
You're a princess?

903
00:50:29,601 --> 00:50:31,326
You're from another world?

904
00:50:33,739 --> 00:50:34,633
That...

905
00:50:34,633 --> 00:50:35,735
is...

906
00:50:35,735 --> 00:50:37,641
awesome!

907
00:50:40,452 --> 00:50:41,288
See?

908
00:50:41,288 --> 00:50:42,025
Told you.

909
00:50:45,432 --> 00:50:48,625
I simply cannot believe they did all this.

910
00:50:48,625 --> 00:50:51,511
If I only had some kind of party cannon

911
00:50:51,511 --> 00:50:53,591
that could decorate everything super fast!

912
00:50:53,996 --> 00:50:55,940
I know it seems impossible, but,

913
00:50:55,940 --> 00:50:58,162
maybe if we all work together?

914
00:50:58,317 --> 00:51:00,520
Now that's the kind of can-do spirit

915
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:03,075
I'm lookin' for in a Fall Formal princess!

916
00:51:03,075 --> 00:51:04,822
Let's do it, y'all!

917
00:51:04,822 --> 00:51:06,250
Absolutely!

918
00:51:06,250 --> 00:51:07,071
Rock on!

919
00:51:07,071 --> 00:51:08,099
Yes, indeedily!

920
00:51:08,099 --> 00:51:09,777
Yay!

921
00:51:10,777 --> 00:51:13,296
<i>It's time for us to come together.</i>

922
00:51:14,333 --> 00:51:17,483
<i>It's the only way that things will get better.</i>

923
00:51:17,928 --> 00:51:20,031
<i>It's time for us to take a stand.</i>

924
00:51:21,297 --> 00:51:25,164
<i>So come on and lend a helping hand.</i>

925
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,806
<i>Fix it up,</i>

926
00:51:28,806 --> 00:51:30,417
<i>Yeah, it's all right.</i>

927
00:51:30,417 --> 00:51:33,964
<i>We'll get it ready by tonight.</i>

928
00:51:33,964 --> 00:51:35,672
<i>Mix it up,</i>

929
00:51:35,672 --> 00:51:37,390
<i>Yeah, help a friend.</i>

930
00:51:37,390 --> 00:51:40,902
<i>We'll come together in the end.</i>

931
00:51:45,751 --> 00:51:49,058
<i>It's time to show that we've got school spirit.</i>

932
00:51:49,058 --> 00:51:52,552
<i>Raise your voice and let everyone hear it.</i>

933
00:51:52,552 --> 00:51:55,678
<i>It's time to show that we're strong.</i>

934
00:51:55,678 --> 00:51:59,792
<i>So come on, everybody, sing along.</i>

935
00:52:01,914 --> 00:52:08,069
<i>Look how we've all come together.</i>

936
00:52:09,152 --> 00:52:14,794
<i>Things are only just starting to get better</i>

937
00:52:15,888 --> 00:52:21,895
<i>Look how we've all come together</i>

938
00:52:22,902 --> 00:52:26,024
<i>Things are only gonna get better,</i>

939
00:52:26,024 --> 00:52:26,952
<i>Things are only gonna get better, better,</i>

940
00:52:26,952 --> 00:52:27,923
<i>Things are only gonna get better, better, better,</i>

941
00:52:27,923 --> 00:52:29,043
<i>Things are only gonna get better, better, better, better!</i>

942
00:52:29,838 --> 00:52:32,940
<i>Fix it up, yeah, it's all right.</i>

943
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:36,492
<i>We'll get it ready by tonight.</i>

944
00:52:36,492 --> 00:52:40,045
<i>Mix it up, yeah, help a friend.</i>

945
00:52:40,045 --> 00:52:43,731
<i>We'll come together in the end.</i>

946
00:52:43,731 --> 00:52:46,989
<i>Fix it up, yeah, it's all right.</i>

947
00:52:46,989 --> 00:52:50,476
<i>We'll get it ready by tonight.</i>

948
00:52:50,476 --> 00:52:53,929
<i>Mix it up, yeah, help a friend.</i>

949
00:52:53,929 --> 00:53:00,526
<i>We'll come together, together now!</i>

950
00:53:05,297 --> 00:53:06,095
This...

951
00:53:06,095 --> 00:53:07,199
looks...

952
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:08,839
sooooo...

953
00:53:08,839 --> 00:53:09,777
GOOD!

954
00:53:11,624 --> 00:53:13,089
All right, everyone!

955
00:53:13,089 --> 00:53:15,432
Fall Formal is back on for this evening.

956
00:53:17,998 --> 00:53:20,524
So you'd better get out of here and start getting ready.

957
00:53:20,524 --> 00:53:22,060
Don't forget to cast your ballots

958
00:53:22,060 --> 00:53:24,357
for the Fall Formal Princess on your way out!

959
00:53:24,683 --> 00:53:26,126
You got my vote, Twilight.

960
00:53:26,126 --> 00:53:27,426
Mine, too!

961
00:53:27,426 --> 00:53:28,945
Mine, too!

962
00:53:28,945 --> 00:53:30,214
Mine, too!

963
00:53:33,461 --> 00:53:36,067
You're lucky she was able to pull this off.

964
00:53:36,067 --> 00:53:38,532
Next time I ask you to make a mess of things,

965
00:53:38,532 --> 00:53:40,640
try to show a little restraint!

966
00:53:40,819 --> 00:53:44,383
I need this Formal to go on tonight just as much as she does.

967
00:53:46,552 --> 00:53:49,790
I still can't believe we pulled that off!

968
00:53:49,790 --> 00:53:50,738
I can!

969
00:53:50,738 --> 00:53:52,477
We're awesome!

970
00:53:52,477 --> 00:53:53,715
Enough chatter, girls.

971
00:53:53,715 --> 00:53:54,892
We need to get ready,

972
00:53:54,892 --> 00:53:57,464
and we need to look fabulous!

973
00:53:57,464 --> 00:54:00,761
<i>This is our big night.</i>

974
00:54:00,761 --> 00:54:01,899
<i>We're getting ready</i>

975
00:54:01,899 --> 00:54:04,739
<i>And we're doing it up right.</i>

976
00:54:04,739 --> 00:54:08,011
<i>This is our big night.</i>

977
00:54:08,011 --> 00:54:09,291
<i>Friendship's arrived,</i>

978
00:54:09,291 --> 00:54:12,220
<i>Now we'll start it out right.</i>

979
00:54:13,749 --> 00:54:14,729
<i>The time's right</i>

980
00:54:14,729 --> 00:54:16,356
<i>Gonna make you last for six</i>

981
00:54:16,356 --> 00:54:17,548
<i>The first night</i>

982
00:54:17,548 --> 00:54:18,857
<i>That we're ever gonna</i>

983
00:54:18,857 --> 00:54:21,155
<i>Start to just have fun together.</i>

984
00:54:21,155 --> 00:54:23,158
<i>We're so glad, so happy</i>

985
00:54:23,158 --> 00:54:25,060
<i> We could never be mad.</i>

986
00:54:25,060 --> 00:54:26,723
<i>Didn't brag now</i>

987
00:54:26,723 --> 00:54:28,462
<i>This our big night now.</i>

988
00:54:28,481 --> 00:54:35,802
<i>Six friends on their way up now.</i>

989
00:54:35,802 --> 00:54:41,932
<i>Six friends here to show you how.</i>

990
00:54:41,932 --> 00:54:45,091
<i>This is our big night.</i>

991
00:54:45,091 --> 00:54:46,569
<i>We're getting ready and we're</i>

992
00:54:46,569 --> 00:54:49,130
<i>Doing it up right.</i>

993
00:54:49,130 --> 00:54:52,512
<i>This is our big night.</i>

994
00:54:52,512 --> 00:54:53,649
<i>We made it happen </i>

995
00:54:53,649 --> 00:54:56,558
<i>Now let's party all night.</i>

996
00:54:56,558 --> 00:55:00,011
<i>This is our big night.</i>

997
00:55:00,011 --> 00:55:03,875
<i>This is our big night.</i>

998
00:55:03,875 --> 00:55:07,627
<i>This is our big night.</i>

999
00:55:07,627 --> 00:55:12,824
<i>This is our big night.</i>

1000
00:55:28,676 --> 00:55:29,732
Twilight!

1001
00:55:32,215 --> 00:55:34,710
Look, I know you said "no" about going to the Fall Formal with me,

1002
00:55:34,710 --> 00:55:37,650
but would you reconsider and at least have one dance?

1003
00:55:38,990 --> 00:55:40,781
I didn't say "no"!

1004
00:55:40,781 --> 00:55:43,014
I mean, I did, but...

1005
00:55:43,014 --> 00:55:45,385
I didn't mean no, to you.

1006
00:55:45,385 --> 00:55:47,701
I was, well, what I mean is...

1007
00:55:47,701 --> 00:55:48,985
yes.

1008
00:55:48,985 --> 00:55:50,500
I'd love to dance with you!

1009
00:56:13,532 --> 00:56:15,629
Anybody see Sunset Shimmer?

1010
00:56:15,629 --> 00:56:17,975
Maybe she was too embarrassed to show!

1011
00:56:17,975 --> 00:56:20,581
She's gotta know you won by a landslide!

1012
00:56:20,944 --> 00:56:22,257
Maybe...

1013
00:56:29,406 --> 00:56:32,621
First off, I want to say how wonderful everything looks tonight.

1014
00:56:32,621 --> 00:56:34,999
You all did a magnificent job pulling things together

1015
00:56:34,999 --> 00:56:37,614
after the unfortunate events of earlier.

1016
00:56:37,798 --> 00:56:40,024
And now, without further ado,

1017
00:56:40,024 --> 00:56:44,360
I'd like to announce the winner of this year's Fall Formal crown.

1018
00:56:46,727 --> 00:56:50,353
The Princess of this year's Fall Formal is...

1019
00:56:53,474 --> 00:56:55,380
Twilight Sparkle!

1020
00:57:03,616 --> 00:57:05,857
Congratulations, Twilight.

1021
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:13,028
Twilight, HELP!

1022
00:57:13,028 --> 00:57:13,741
Spike?

1023
00:57:17,729 --> 00:57:18,969
They've got Spike!

1024
00:57:41,591 --> 00:57:42,943
That's close enough!

1025
00:57:49,052 --> 00:57:49,988
Twilight!

1026
00:57:51,064 --> 00:57:52,649
Don't hurt him!

1027
00:57:52,649 --> 00:57:54,234
Oh, I wouldn't dream of it.

1028
00:57:54,234 --> 00:57:55,993
I'm not a monster, Twilight.

1029
00:57:55,993 --> 00:57:57,293
Let him go.

1030
00:58:02,064 --> 00:58:03,521
You don't belong here.

1031
00:58:03,521 --> 00:58:07,291
Give me the crown, and you can go back to Equestria tonight.

1032
00:58:07,291 --> 00:58:10,225
Or keep it, and never go home.

1033
00:58:11,847 --> 00:58:14,325
Tick-tock, Twilight, we haven't got all night.

1034
00:58:14,325 --> 00:58:17,136
The portal will be closing on its own in less than an hour.

1035
00:58:18,101 --> 00:58:20,840
So, what's your answer?

1036
00:58:24,848 --> 00:58:25,924
No.

1037
00:58:25,924 --> 00:58:27,111
What!?

1038
00:58:27,111 --> 00:58:27,955
Equestria.

1039
00:58:27,955 --> 00:58:29,010
Your friends.

1040
00:58:29,010 --> 00:58:30,467
Lost to you forever.

1041
00:58:30,467 --> 00:58:32,877
Don't you see what I'm about to do to the portal?

1042
00:58:32,877 --> 00:58:34,779
Yes, but I've also seen

1043
00:58:34,779 --> 00:58:37,022
what you've been able to do here without magic.

1044
00:58:37,346 --> 00:58:40,783
Equestria will find a way to survive without my Element of Harmony.

1045
00:58:41,012 --> 00:58:44,642
This place might not, if I allow it to fall into your hands.

1046
00:58:45,218 --> 00:58:47,782
So go ahead, destroy the portal.

1047
00:58:47,782 --> 00:58:50,048
You are not getting this crown!

1048
00:58:51,830 --> 00:58:52,558
Fine.

1049
00:58:53,169 --> 00:58:53,995
You win.

1050
00:58:57,939 --> 00:58:58,641
You...

1051
00:58:58,641 --> 00:58:59,454
are...

1052
00:58:59,454 --> 00:59:00,718
so awesome!

1053
00:59:00,718 --> 00:59:02,917
I can't believe you were going to do that for us!

1054
00:59:02,917 --> 00:59:06,148
It's no wonder you were a real live princess!

1055
00:59:07,733 --> 00:59:10,549
Oh, yes, she's so very special!

1056
00:59:20,046 --> 00:59:21,488
Grab him, you fools!

1057
00:59:32,036 --> 00:59:32,904
Spike!

1058
00:59:32,904 --> 00:59:33,853
Spike!

1059
00:59:40,637 --> 00:59:41,830
Fluttershy!

1060
00:59:54,764 --> 00:59:56,186
I'll take that!

1061
00:59:57,717 --> 00:59:58,673
At last,

1062
01:00:00,096 --> 01:00:03,876
more power than I have ever imagined.

1063
01:00:54,773 --> 01:00:56,607
This is going to be so cool!

1064
01:01:10,497 --> 01:01:12,886
I've had to jump through so many hoops tonight

1065
01:01:12,886 --> 01:01:15,675
just to get my hands on this crown,

1066
01:01:15,675 --> 01:01:18,929
and it really should have been mine all along.

1067
01:01:21,472 --> 01:01:24,520
But let's let bygones be bygones.

1068
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:27,823
I am your princess now,

1069
01:01:27,823 --> 01:01:31,572
and you will be loyal to me!

1070
01:01:50,592 --> 01:01:52,907
Round them up and bring them to the portal.

1071
01:01:57,492 --> 01:02:02,498
Spoiler alert: I was bluffing when I said I was going to destroy the portal.

1072
01:02:02,498 --> 01:02:05,654
I don't want to rule this pathetic little high school;

1073
01:02:05,654 --> 01:02:08,006
I want Equestria!

1074
01:02:08,006 --> 01:02:11,776
And with my own little teenage army behind me,

1075
01:02:11,776 --> 01:02:13,633
I am going to get it!

1076
01:02:16,698 --> 01:02:18,767
No, you're not!

1077
01:02:19,910 --> 01:02:20,822
Oh, please!

1078
01:02:20,822 --> 01:02:23,911
What exactly do you think you're going to do to stop me?

1079
01:02:23,911 --> 01:02:25,452
I have magic,

1080
01:02:25,452 --> 01:02:28,191
and you have nothing!

1081
01:02:29,288 --> 01:02:30,983
She has us!

1082
01:02:36,773 --> 01:02:41,036
Gee, the gang really is all back together again.

1083
01:02:43,310 --> 01:02:44,992
Now step aside!

1084
01:02:44,992 --> 01:02:49,746
Twilight has tried to interfere with my plans one too many times already

1085
01:02:49,746 --> 01:02:52,407
and she needs to be dealt with.

1086
01:02:58,788 --> 01:02:59,693
What!?

1087
01:03:09,619 --> 01:03:11,462
The magic contained in my Element

1088
01:03:11,462 --> 01:03:13,668
was able to unite with those that helped create it!

1089
01:03:26,778 --> 01:03:27,825
Honesty!

1090
01:03:34,773 --> 01:03:35,790
Kindness!

1091
01:03:43,518 --> 01:03:44,770
Laughter!

1092
01:03:50,662 --> 01:03:52,027
Generosity!

1093
01:03:58,076 --> 01:03:58,953
Loyalty!

1094
01:04:02,075 --> 01:04:03,130
Magic!

1095
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:06,926
Together with a crown,

1096
01:04:06,926 --> 01:04:09,830
they create a power beyond anything you could imagine,

1097
01:04:09,830 --> 01:04:12,848
and it is a power you don't have the ability to control!

1098
01:04:13,394 --> 01:04:15,877
The crown may be upon your head, Sunset Shimmer,

1099
01:04:15,877 --> 01:04:17,469
but you can not wield it,

1100
01:04:17,469 --> 01:04:20,523
because you do not possess the most powerful magic of all:

1101
01:04:20,523 --> 01:04:22,363
the magic of friendship!

1102
01:04:28,751 --> 01:04:30,235
No!

1103
01:04:31,932 --> 01:04:34,204
What is happening?

1104
01:04:37,861 --> 01:04:39,344
Here and in Equestria,

1105
01:04:39,344 --> 01:04:42,392
it is the only magic that can truly unite us all!

1106
01:05:27,143 --> 01:05:29,550
You will never rule in Equestria.

1107
01:05:29,550 --> 01:05:32,059
Any power you may have had in this world is gone.

1108
01:05:32,059 --> 01:05:35,543
Tonight, you've shown everyone who you really are.

1109
01:05:35,543 --> 01:05:37,756
You've shown them what is in your heart.

1110
01:05:39,352 --> 01:05:41,369
I'm sorry.

1111
01:05:42,170 --> 01:05:43,951
I'm so sorry.

1112
01:05:43,951 --> 01:05:45,978
I didn't know there was another way.

1113
01:05:45,978 --> 01:05:49,159
The magic of friendship doesn't just exist in Equestria.

1114
01:05:49,159 --> 01:05:51,017
It's everywhere.

1115
01:05:52,267 --> 01:05:53,694
You can seek it out,

1116
01:05:53,694 --> 01:05:55,660
or you can forever be alone.

1117
01:05:55,660 --> 01:05:57,678
The choice is yours.

1118
01:05:57,678 --> 01:05:58,347
But...

1119
01:05:59,028 --> 01:06:03,202
But all I've ever done since being here is drive everyone apart.

1120
01:06:03,202 --> 01:06:05,616
I don't know the first thing about friendship.

1121
01:06:08,014 --> 01:06:09,743
I bet they can teach you.

1122
01:06:10,655 --> 01:06:12,069
Those are my girls!

1123
01:06:12,069 --> 01:06:12,836
Woo-hoo!

1124
01:06:12,836 --> 01:06:14,253
Did that dog just talk?

1125
01:06:14,253 --> 01:06:14,953
Whoa.

1126
01:06:14,953 --> 01:06:15,591
Weird.

1127
01:06:15,820 --> 01:06:17,345
Seriously?

1128
01:06:17,345 --> 01:06:20,387
The talking dog is the weird thing about all this?

1129
01:06:20,387 --> 01:06:23,356
I, for one, think you're adorable.

1130
01:06:23,356 --> 01:06:24,395
Oh, yeah.

1131
01:06:25,055 --> 01:06:28,266
I believe this belongs to you.

1132
01:06:28,266 --> 01:06:30,820
A true princess in any world leads

1133
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:33,614
not by forcing others to bow before her,

1134
01:06:33,614 --> 01:06:37,242
but by inspiring others to stand with her.

1135
01:06:37,242 --> 01:06:41,146
We have all seen that you are capable of just that.

1136
01:06:41,146 --> 01:06:45,315
I hope you see it too, Princess Twilight.

1137
01:06:47,163 --> 01:06:48,283
I do.

1138
01:06:51,474 --> 01:06:55,680
Would now be a completely awkward time to ask you for that dance?

1139
01:07:04,358 --> 01:07:07,675
<i>This is our big night.</i>

1140
01:07:07,675 --> 01:07:08,787
<i>We made it happen</i>

1141
01:07:08,787 --> 01:07:11,758
<i>Now let's party all night.</i>

1142
01:07:13,158 --> 01:07:14,214
<i>We're here now</i>

1143
01:07:14,214 --> 01:07:17,219
<i>And we worked so hard to make it come around</i>

1144
01:07:17,219 --> 01:07:18,004
<i>To tonight.</i>

1145
01:07:18,004 --> 01:07:20,480
<i>So let's try to make it last forever.</i>

1146
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:22,617
<i>Cool lights so bright,</i>

1147
01:07:22,617 --> 01:07:24,290
<i>Beat is pumping through the night.</i>

1148
01:07:24,290 --> 01:07:25,470
<i>Party's starting,</i>

1149
01:07:25,470 --> 01:07:28,077
<i>DJ's got the music just right!</i>

1150
01:07:28,077 --> 01:07:35,111
<i>Six friends on their way up now.</i>

1151
01:07:35,111 --> 01:07:41,384
<i>Six friends here to show you how.</i>

1152
01:07:41,384 --> 01:07:44,599
<i>This is our big night.</i>

1153
01:07:44,599 --> 01:07:53,865
<i>This is our big night.</i>

1154
01:07:56,997 --> 01:07:58,548
You'll look out for her, won't you?

1155
01:07:58,981 --> 01:08:01,039
Of course we will.

1156
01:08:01,039 --> 01:08:04,169
Although I do expect some sort of apology for last spring's debacle.

1157
01:08:04,484 --> 01:08:08,165
I have a feeling she'll be handing out a lot of apologies.

1158
01:08:10,903 --> 01:08:12,001
We better get going.

1159
01:08:13,174 --> 01:08:15,893
I know we've only been friends for a short time,

1160
01:08:15,893 --> 01:08:18,202
but I'm going to miss all of you so much.

1161
01:08:23,633 --> 01:08:27,268
That crown really does suit you, Princess Twilight.

1162
01:08:27,268 --> 01:08:28,378
You know what, Spike?

1163
01:08:28,378 --> 01:08:31,731
I am starting to feel a little more comfortable wearing it.

1164
01:08:31,912 --> 01:08:33,121
And the wings?

1165
01:08:33,121 --> 01:08:36,698
I've been walking on two legs and picking things up with these.

1166
01:08:36,698 --> 01:08:37,772
Wings?

1167
01:08:37,772 --> 01:08:41,066
I'm thrilled that's all I'll be dealing with back in Equestria!

1168
01:08:54,312 --> 01:08:56,178
Oh, bummer!

1169
01:09:10,457 --> 01:09:11,999
Twilight!

1170
01:09:11,999 --> 01:09:13,605
Ah, you're back!

1171
01:09:13,605 --> 01:09:14,910
You've got your crown!

1172
01:09:15,597 --> 01:09:17,420
I knew you could do it!

1173
01:09:17,420 --> 01:09:19,325
Oh, we were so worried.

1174
01:09:19,325 --> 01:09:21,784
Sunset Shimmer, is she alright?

1175
01:09:21,784 --> 01:09:23,624
I think she's going to be fine.

1176
01:09:23,624 --> 01:09:26,498
I left her in good hands.

1177
01:09:27,527 --> 01:09:28,915
What are hands?

1178
01:09:34,944 --> 01:09:36,053
Where did you stay?

1179
01:09:36,053 --> 01:09:36,842
What did they wear?

1180
01:09:36,842 --> 01:09:37,855
Did you have fun?

1181
01:09:37,855 --> 01:09:38,572
What'd you eat?

1182
01:09:38,572 --> 01:09:40,946
Would you say she's just as awesome as me?

1183
01:09:40,946 --> 01:09:43,500
I want to tell you all everything, I do,

1184
01:09:43,500 --> 01:09:46,137
but I'm just so exhausted from all the dancing.

1185
01:09:46,137 --> 01:09:47,242
Dancing?

1186
01:09:50,220 --> 01:09:52,735
We've got to stop bumping into each other like this.

1187
01:09:56,175 --> 01:09:57,563
Who was that?

1188
01:09:57,563 --> 01:09:59,583
He's the new member of the castle guard.

1189
01:09:59,583 --> 01:10:01,261
Flash Sentry, I think.

1190
01:10:01,261 --> 01:10:02,399
Why?

1191
01:10:02,399 --> 01:10:03,898
Do you know him?

1192
01:10:03,898 --> 01:10:05,302
Not exactly.

1193
01:10:06,117 --> 01:10:09,719
Oooh! Somepony's got a crush on the new guy!

1194
01:10:09,719 --> 01:10:11,041
No. No, I don't.

1195
01:10:11,533 --> 01:10:12,613
She does!

1196
01:10:12,613 --> 01:10:14,667
She absolutely does!

1197
01:10:14,667 --> 01:10:15,702
Don't be ridiculous.

1198
01:10:15,702 --> 01:10:16,911
I don't even know him.

1199
01:10:16,911 --> 01:10:17,873
He just...

1200
01:10:17,873 --> 01:10:19,981
Totally reminds you of a guy you met in the other world

1201
01:10:19,981 --> 01:10:21,030
who played guitar,  was in a band,

1202
01:10:21,030 --> 01:10:23,480
and helped prove you didn't destroy all the decorations for a big dance,

1203
01:10:23,480 --> 01:10:25,335
so you could still run for princess of the big dance,

1204
01:10:25,335 --> 01:10:27,324
and asked you to dance at that dance!

1205
01:10:27,831 --> 01:10:28,712
Right?

1206
01:10:29,624 --> 01:10:31,011
How did you know that?

1207
01:10:31,011 --> 01:10:32,327
Just a hunch!
