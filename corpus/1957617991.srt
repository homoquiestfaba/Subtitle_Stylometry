(reggae continues)

00:00:44,634 --> 00:00:46,922
- [Narrator] Omari remembered
how it all started.

5
00:00:46,922 --> 00:00:48,500
When he was assisting his mentor Bill,

6
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,560
at prestigious TV award show.

7
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,349
Omari was helping Bill with B roll footage

8
00:00:52,349 --> 00:00:54,221
for the station he worked for.

9
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:56,194
Everybody who was somebody in TV

10
00:00:56,194 --> 00:00:58,111
was at this award show.

11
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:01,833
(reggae music)

12
00:01:18,471 --> 00:01:21,304
(music continues)

(music continues)

14
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:44,059
(funky music)

15
00:01:48,113 --> 00:01:51,446
(funky music continues)

16
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,648
- My old buddy Chris from college.

17
00:01:57,648 --> 00:01:58,590
- Omari?

18
00:01:58,590 --> 00:01:59,939
My Black brother.

19
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:00,928
- The fuck is going on, dog?

20
00:02:00,928 --> 00:02:01,761
- How are you, man?

21
00:02:01,761 --> 00:02:02,848
- Ah!

22
00:02:02,848 --> 00:02:04,019
(both inhale)

23
00:02:04,019 --> 00:02:04,852
(both laugh)

24
00:02:04,852 --> 00:02:06,352
Oh shit, shit man!

25
00:02:07,356 --> 00:02:09,189
- How've you been?
- So what's been going on?

26
00:02:09,189 --> 00:02:11,364
- I'm working for a public
access television station.

27
00:02:11,364 --> 00:02:12,995
KDEB TV?

28
00:02:12,995 --> 00:02:14,184
- Is that right?

29
00:02:14,184 --> 00:02:16,473
So you run it, what?

30
00:02:16,473 --> 00:02:19,285
- Well, I don't exactly
run it, but I manage it.

31
00:02:19,285 --> 00:02:20,734
I produce all the shows.

32
00:02:20,734 --> 00:02:22,485
I'm in charge of all the people we hire.

33
00:02:22,485 --> 00:02:25,054
As a matter of fact, we're
looking for full-time director.

34
00:02:25,054 --> 00:02:26,755
You wouldn't be interested
in that, would you?

35
00:02:26,755 --> 00:02:27,743
- Hell yeah!

36
00:02:27,743 --> 00:02:30,835
Man, I'm working at the
shoe barns, you know,

37
00:02:30,835 --> 00:02:34,776
but running a little video
business, but nothing big.

38
00:02:34,776 --> 00:02:36,936
- Well hey I'll give you my card.

39
00:02:36,936 --> 00:02:38,633
- Cool, okay.

40
00:02:38,633 --> 00:02:39,623
- Give me a call, if you want.

41
00:02:39,623 --> 00:02:42,125
I'll set up an interview
with my boss right away.

42
00:02:42,125 --> 00:02:44,355
You're a good director,
I know you'd get the job.

43
00:02:44,355 --> 00:02:46,704
We can tear it up here, man.

44
00:02:46,704 --> 00:02:49,224
Remember how we kicked up
the dust in college, right?

45
00:02:49,224 --> 00:02:51,462
- [Narrator] Omari and Chris
attended college together.

46
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:53,595
They both majored in TV production.

47
00:02:53,595 --> 00:02:55,216
Chris, when seeing Omari,

48
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:57,424
was interested in going
into business with Omari.

49
00:02:57,424 --> 00:03:00,474
But his intentions weren't
for Omari's best interest.

50
00:03:00,474 --> 00:03:01,307
- Come check it, man.

51
00:03:01,307 --> 00:03:02,340
- All right, man.
- Maybe we can do something.

52
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:03,439
- You better give me a call.

53
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:04,420
- Aight.
- You got to get rid of that

54
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:05,464
shoe box, shit.

55
00:03:05,464 --> 00:03:06,672
- Hey, lighten up, cap.

56
00:03:06,672 --> 00:03:07,630
(both laugh)

57
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:08,463
I'll talk to you.

58
00:03:08,463 --> 00:03:09,296
- All right.
- All right.

59
00:03:09,296 --> 00:03:11,562
See ya. You better call me.

60
00:03:11,562 --> 00:03:14,062
(funky music)

61
00:03:25,162 --> 00:03:27,745
(reggae music)

62
00:03:30,802 --> 00:03:32,253
- [Narrator] Omari knew within his heart

63
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:33,573
that hooking up with Chris again

64
00:03:33,573 --> 00:03:37,304
was going to mean Omari
putting in some serious work.

65
00:03:37,304 --> 00:03:39,887
(reggae music)

66
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,514
KDEB TV3, the Oakland
public access station.

67
00:03:50,514 --> 00:03:53,434
Where Chris worked as
supervising producer.

68
00:03:53,434 --> 00:03:55,601
(chatter)

69
00:03:57,743 --> 00:03:59,344
- I'll see you later.

70
00:03:59,344 --> 00:04:00,177
- Hi.

71
00:04:00,177 --> 00:04:01,554
- Hi, can I help you find someone?

72
00:04:01,554 --> 00:04:03,211
- Yes, I'm looking for Chris Williams?

73
00:04:03,211 --> 00:04:07,283
- Oh, sure, follow me, I'll
take you to his office.

74
00:04:07,283 --> 00:04:08,624
- Okay, thank you, Chris for your help.

75
00:04:08,624 --> 00:04:09,813
I'm going to go out there and get Donna

76
00:04:09,813 --> 00:04:10,984
and to get started on this.

77
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:12,984
- All right.
- All right.

78
00:04:13,914 --> 00:04:16,747
(person knocking)

79
00:04:18,017 --> 00:04:21,621
- [Receptionist] There's
someone here to see you.

80
00:04:21,621 --> 00:04:23,391
- Excuse me, are you Chris?

81
00:04:23,391 --> 00:04:24,224
- Yes, hi,

82
00:04:26,315 --> 00:04:28,148
would you like a seat?

83
00:04:29,712 --> 00:04:30,879
- I'm Marissa.

84
00:04:31,853 --> 00:04:34,381
ESL teacher at McChesney middle school.

85
00:04:34,381 --> 00:04:35,483
- ESL, that's?

86
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:37,243
- English as Second Language.

87
00:04:37,243 --> 00:04:39,493
`I'm also the president
for the science fair.

88
00:04:39,493 --> 00:04:40,791
I called in to talk about you holding

89
00:04:40,791 --> 00:04:42,152
a science fair in my school.

90
00:04:42,152 --> 00:04:44,432
- Oh okay, now I remember.

91
00:04:44,432 --> 00:04:47,211
For some reason, I pictured
you looking a lot different.

92
00:04:47,211 --> 00:04:49,349
You do look like a model.

93
00:04:49,349 --> 00:04:51,477
How many apples do you get everyday?

94
00:04:51,477 --> 00:04:53,318
- Um, about 10.

95
00:04:53,318 --> 00:04:55,179
(Chris chuckles)

96
00:04:55,179 --> 00:04:56,731
- [Narrator] When Chris
laid eyes upon Marissa

97
00:04:56,731 --> 00:05:00,481
for the first time, he
fell in love with her.

98
00:05:01,389 --> 00:05:04,099
- Well, come on, let me
show you around the station.

99
00:05:04,099 --> 00:05:05,188
- [Eric] Hello, hello, hello!

100
00:05:05,188 --> 00:05:07,328
- Hey Eric, this is Marissa.

101
00:05:07,328 --> 00:05:09,869
She a teacher at McChesney middle school.

102
00:05:09,869 --> 00:05:10,949
- Nice to meet you, Marissa.

103
00:05:10,949 --> 00:05:11,859
- Nice to meet you, Eric.

104
00:05:11,859 --> 00:05:14,377
- Chris, you need to
get set up and get ready

105
00:05:14,377 --> 00:05:15,258
to input your non-linear.

106
00:05:15,258 --> 00:05:18,058
- All right, can you give
me like five minutes?

107
00:05:18,058 --> 00:05:19,787
I want to show her around the station.

108
00:05:19,787 --> 00:05:21,570
- Great, it's nice meeting you Marissa.

109
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:23,657
- Nice to meet you too.

110
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:26,907
(easy listening music)

111
00:05:38,823 --> 00:05:40,591
- Jesus, help me out here.

112
00:05:40,591 --> 00:05:42,751
I cannot work with Jessica anymore.

113
00:05:42,751 --> 00:05:44,823
No matter what I do,
it's never good enough!

114
00:05:44,823 --> 00:05:46,974
- They're not catching up, it's too slow.

115
00:05:46,974 --> 00:05:49,616
- Donna, Donna, I hear you
and we have discussed this

116
00:05:49,616 --> 00:05:51,111
to death, okay?

117
00:05:51,111 --> 00:05:52,383
I understand your point.

118
00:05:52,383 --> 00:05:55,701
The bigger point is that
Jessica is a major talent.

119
00:05:55,701 --> 00:05:59,225
- I hate to interrupt but...
- Major talent Ha!

120
00:05:59,225 --> 00:06:01,040
- Hey, you know, this is
actually perfect timing.

121
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,690
I'm sorry ladies, but we really need

122
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:04,320
to do this another time.

123
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,661
We have talked this into the dirt.

124
00:06:05,661 --> 00:06:06,494
- Perfect time.

125
00:06:06,494 --> 00:06:07,327
No offense, Chris, it's not you.

126
00:06:07,327 --> 00:06:09,160
- I hear your concerns
but right now I just have

127
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,760
too many other things going on.

128
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,741
We really need to sit down
when we can have some time

129
00:06:12,741 --> 00:06:14,309
to talk about ways of dealing with this.

130
00:06:14,309 --> 00:06:16,875
- Fine, let's talk about it this week.

131
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:18,235
- Okay, okay.

132
00:06:18,235 --> 00:06:19,888
- Check, check!

133
00:06:19,888 --> 00:06:22,380
You have my calendar, check
my schedule and go ahead,

134
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:25,338
let's do it later, two hours, okay?

135
00:06:25,338 --> 00:06:26,810
Not on Thursday.

136
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:28,500
- [Woman] Okay.
- Thank you.

137
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,400
- Jesus, this is Omari, the man
I've been telling you about.

138
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,620
- Good morning, nice to finally
to meet you, how are you?

139
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:34,453
- Nice to meet you.

140
00:06:34,453 --> 00:06:35,911
- Hey, have a seat, man.

141
00:06:35,911 --> 00:06:39,372
- [Jesus] You too, man,
you know the routine.

142
00:06:39,372 --> 00:06:40,380
Sorry I'm real jumbled.

143
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:44,850
I had, you see, more of the
usual drama happening, but...

144
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:46,610
- [Narrator] Jesus ran KDEB.

145
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:48,991
He was already aware
of Omari's work history

146
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:50,540
because Chris showed him his reel,

147
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:52,543
which included Omari's work.

148
00:06:52,543 --> 00:06:53,751
- You don't have to do a
whole lot of talking about it,

149
00:06:53,751 --> 00:06:55,410
looking at resumes or anything like that.

150
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:57,330
You want a job, you've got one.

151
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:58,324
You down?

152
00:06:58,324 --> 00:07:00,042
- Hey, I want that.

153
00:07:00,042 --> 00:07:01,410
- Just that quick, you take care of us,

154
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:02,570
we'll take care of you, okay?

155
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:03,403
- Thanks a lot, man.

156
00:07:03,403 --> 00:07:05,970
- Chris, why don't you have Pat get the

157
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:07,558
proper paperwork together

158
00:07:07,558 --> 00:07:09,277
and we'll get the ship sailing.

159
00:07:09,277 --> 00:07:11,939
Sound like a plan?
- Sounds great.

160
00:07:11,939 --> 00:07:13,279
- Probably the easiest
job you ever got, huh?

161
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:14,112
- Oh yeah.

162
00:07:14,112 --> 00:07:15,570
- Okay, well we'll make it work.

163
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:17,146
- All right.
- All right?

164
00:07:17,146 --> 00:07:18,210
- Let's do it.

165
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:20,587
- Hey, give me a holler later too, okay?

166
00:07:20,587 --> 00:07:21,420
- Cool.

167
00:07:22,487 --> 00:07:24,904
(jazz music)

168
00:07:36,657 --> 00:07:39,930
- Hey you know next week,
we've got some major projects.

169
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:42,638
- Hey, but you know the
records all I know, man.

170
00:07:42,638 --> 00:07:44,628
I love that shit dude, it keeps me bad.

171
00:07:44,628 --> 00:07:47,498
It makes my dick hard, you
know what I'm saying, for real.

172
00:07:47,498 --> 00:07:50,197
Speaking of that, I got a
major booty call tonight.

173
00:07:50,197 --> 00:07:51,738
- You ain't got no lady.

174
00:07:51,738 --> 00:07:53,508
- Man, I'm living the single life, cat.

175
00:07:53,508 --> 00:07:55,058
You know what I'm sayin'?

176
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:57,374
Like what I do, say what I do.

177
00:07:57,374 --> 00:07:59,198
All I do is produce.

178
00:07:59,198 --> 00:08:01,420
- Yeah, I know what you mean.

179
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:04,202
That helped me and Marissa click.

180
00:08:04,202 --> 00:08:06,620
We got lunch tomorrow. I'm excited.

181
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:09,491
- [Narrator] ...lure Omari
into the porn business.

182
00:08:09,491 --> 00:08:11,091
Chris needed a partner.

183
00:08:11,091 --> 00:08:13,008
Someone he could trust.

184
00:08:15,062 --> 00:08:15,982
- Okay.

185
00:08:15,982 --> 00:08:18,411
You remember when we used
to do parties in college?

186
00:08:18,411 --> 00:08:22,188
- Why wouldn't I? You almost
got expelled for that.

187
00:08:22,188 --> 00:08:25,090
Mother fucker had me struggling
to show up for auditions.

188
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:26,330
- I know she saw us.

189
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:27,959
She took all the equipment.

190
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:30,349
Hey that master tape was in there too.

191
00:08:30,349 --> 00:08:31,930
We never got to see it.

192
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:34,309
We had like 10 women up there naked.

193
00:08:34,309 --> 00:08:35,976
And then we go, man.

194
00:08:37,138 --> 00:08:40,754
- Hey, you ever thought
about doing it now?

195
00:08:40,754 --> 00:08:43,317
Or like all the time.

196
00:08:43,317 --> 00:08:46,157
- Yeah, of course, all the time.

197
00:08:46,157 --> 00:08:48,389
I just need a business partner.

198
00:08:48,389 --> 00:08:49,472
How about it?

199
00:08:50,709 --> 00:08:52,567
- I'm down but we gotta find

200
00:08:52,567 --> 00:08:54,309
a better way of gettin' talent.

201
00:08:54,309 --> 00:08:56,157
I don't want to get caught.

202
00:08:56,157 --> 00:08:57,578
- It's no problem.

203
00:08:57,578 --> 00:09:00,661
We got plenty of time to plan it out.

204
00:09:02,029 --> 00:09:04,890
- How do we distribute it?

205
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:06,519
- I got a couple of magazines.

206
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:08,589
They'll distribute for us.

207
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:12,260
They'll do all the advertising too.

208
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,309
- I guess I'm down.

209
00:09:13,309 --> 00:09:15,172
- All right, man.

210
00:09:15,172 --> 00:09:16,005
Let's do it.

211
00:09:16,005 --> 00:09:17,038
I guess we're in cahoots.

212
00:09:17,038 --> 00:09:17,871
- Sure.

213
00:09:23,318 --> 00:09:25,405
- Omari, what's up baby?

214
00:09:25,405 --> 00:09:28,108
Where else we gonna talk
about some porn flicks man?

215
00:09:28,108 --> 00:09:29,737
- [Narrator] This of
noxious character repo

216
00:09:29,737 --> 00:09:32,206
is what we consider a Buster.

217
00:09:32,206 --> 00:09:34,377
Always trying to be in
somebody's business.

218
00:09:34,377 --> 00:09:37,857
It seems like he can hear
it through the walls.

219
00:09:37,857 --> 00:09:41,075
- Excuse me. Don't put our
stuff like that on the street.

220
00:09:41,075 --> 00:09:42,352
Don't be exposing our business.

221
00:09:42,352 --> 00:09:44,305
Loose lips sink ships.

222
00:09:44,305 --> 00:09:45,804
- That's a pretty good point.

223
00:09:45,804 --> 00:09:47,985
Gentlemen, she just made
a real valid, good point.

224
00:09:47,985 --> 00:09:49,134
Loose lips do sink ships,

225
00:09:49,134 --> 00:09:49,967
you know what I'm saying?

226
00:09:49,967 --> 00:09:50,800
And it's like this.

227
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,111
Y'all I got to go knock some
boots, have her sit on my face,

228
00:09:53,111 --> 00:09:54,047
you know what I'm saying?
We keep it dirty man.

229
00:09:54,047 --> 00:09:56,880
- That's why she beating your ass.

230
00:09:59,051 --> 00:10:01,134
- Sucker'll do for pussy.

231
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,299
Hold on God.

232
00:10:05,299 --> 00:10:06,466
Be right back.

233
00:10:09,619 --> 00:10:12,202
(woman laughs)

234
00:10:16,352 --> 00:10:19,246
- Hello.
- How you doing?

235
00:10:19,246 --> 00:10:20,079
- Hey

236
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:21,964
- My names's Valaria, what's your name?

237
00:10:21,964 --> 00:10:25,184
- Omari.
- Nice to meet your Omari.

238
00:10:25,184 --> 00:10:28,684
- So is it true that you make adult films?

239
00:10:29,817 --> 00:10:31,046
- Maybe why do you ask?

240
00:10:31,046 --> 00:10:33,762
- I overheard the conversation.

241
00:10:33,762 --> 00:10:35,640
Do you mind buyin' me another drink?

242
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:39,160
- You must think I'm some
kind of sucker or something.

243
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,660
What you drinkin'?

244
00:10:42,028 --> 00:10:45,111
- The same thing, a double margarita.

245
00:10:50,385 --> 00:10:53,849
(people laughing)

246
00:10:53,849 --> 00:10:56,182
- [Offscreen] Oh honey wow.

247
00:11:00,161 --> 00:11:03,459
- (claps) Play time is over.

248
00:11:03,459 --> 00:11:04,292
Listen up.

249
00:11:04,292 --> 00:11:06,889
We got some important things
to cover this morning.

250
00:11:06,889 --> 00:11:08,671
By the way, who won?

251
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:12,618
- I think I'm going to have
to go with both of these guys.

252
00:11:12,618 --> 00:11:13,874
(group chattering and laughing)

253
00:11:13,874 --> 00:11:15,702
- I think we're ready
for the meeting Jesus.

254
00:11:15,702 --> 00:11:17,913
- Anyway, now that that's over.

255
00:11:17,913 --> 00:11:21,064
Jessica, my superstar what's happening?

256
00:11:21,064 --> 00:11:22,864
I'd like to take this time to introduce

257
00:11:22,864 --> 00:11:24,233
a new employee, everyone.

258
00:11:24,233 --> 00:11:25,433
This is the Omari Joan.

259
00:11:25,433 --> 00:11:27,235
A very talented director.

260
00:11:27,235 --> 00:11:28,595
- [Narrator] Jesus was a go-getter.

261
00:11:28,595 --> 00:11:29,715
All his ideas worked.

262
00:11:29,715 --> 00:11:30,802
Once he hired Omari,

263
00:11:30,802 --> 00:11:33,686
he knew the level of the
station was moving forward.

264
00:11:33,686 --> 00:11:34,519
- [Jesus] If anyone needs me,

265
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:36,187
I'll actually be meeting
with the superintendent

266
00:11:36,187 --> 00:11:38,227
for the unified school district.

267
00:11:38,227 --> 00:11:39,935
And I'm going to take Pat with me,

268
00:11:39,935 --> 00:11:43,093
stay busy and have a great day.

269
00:11:43,093 --> 00:11:45,760
(group chatter)

270
00:11:47,564 --> 00:11:48,863
- All right, everybody
have a good weekend?

271
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:50,172
- Tell us about your
date with Marissa man.

272
00:11:50,172 --> 00:11:51,741
- Oh, it was incredible.

273
00:11:51,741 --> 00:11:54,113
She is the one man.

274
00:11:54,113 --> 00:11:55,452
We ended up spending the whole afternoon

275
00:11:55,452 --> 00:11:58,810
and the night together, we slept together

276
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:00,263
but we didn't do anything.

277
00:12:00,263 --> 00:12:01,884
We just talked all night.

278
00:12:01,884 --> 00:12:03,452
You want to hear the biggest surprise?

279
00:12:03,452 --> 00:12:05,183
Her folks are loaded.

280
00:12:05,183 --> 00:12:06,100
- No, shit!

281
00:12:06,993 --> 00:12:10,463
- I'm telling you Omari I am a new man.

282
00:12:10,463 --> 00:12:12,932
- I can see it in your eyes man.

283
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:15,921
- We're going out to dinner
after the studio shoot tonight,

284
00:12:15,921 --> 00:12:18,543
schools are out this week.

285
00:12:18,543 --> 00:12:20,626
- Movin' kinda fast, huh?

286
00:12:22,089 --> 00:12:24,756
Hey, I think somebody's in love.

287
00:12:27,631 --> 00:12:29,974
- [Woman] Hey guys,
everything's ready to go.

288
00:12:29,974 --> 00:12:31,505
- You're on Omari.

289
00:12:31,505 --> 00:12:32,338
You're directing.

290
00:12:32,338 --> 00:12:33,985
I'm switching.

291
00:12:33,985 --> 00:12:35,818
- Let's rock and roll.

292
00:12:36,831 --> 00:12:38,174
- Okay. I'm with you.

293
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:41,363
I have tone and it felt good.

294
00:12:41,363 --> 00:12:42,983
- [Narrator] The crew at KDB TV3

295
00:12:42,983 --> 00:12:45,043
are preparing for a major TV interview

296
00:12:45,043 --> 00:12:47,473

00:12:47,473 --> 00:12:50,705
who starred in three movies
that did well at the box office,

298
00:12:50,705 --> 00:12:54,062
a famous actress for Devinare productions.

299
00:12:54,062 --> 00:12:56,342
- Is that one on the headset?

300
00:12:56,342 --> 00:12:57,923
Okay. Cool. Buckle up.

301
00:12:57,923 --> 00:12:59,955
This may be a bumpy ride.

302
00:12:59,955 --> 00:13:00,788
- I got ya.

303
00:13:00,788 --> 00:13:01,621
I got ya.

304
00:13:01,621 --> 00:13:02,772
Quiet on the set

305
00:13:02,772 --> 00:13:03,605
and we are on in 5, 4, 3, 2 and-

306
00:13:03,605 --> 00:13:07,510
(backstage chatter thorughout)

307
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:08,432
- [Omari] Good job people.

308
00:13:08,432 --> 00:13:11,443
- [Jessica] Hello, I'm Jessica
Healy, from KDB TV and today

309
00:13:11,443 --> 00:13:14,461
we have in our studio,
superintendent Renee Gonzolas.

310
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:16,803
Thanks for joining us here.

311
00:13:16,803 --> 00:13:18,435
- [Omari] Switcher, Capri on deck.

312
00:13:18,435 --> 00:13:19,291
- Superintendent. Renee.

313
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:21,563
I understand you're bringing
in a new innovative program

314
00:13:21,563 --> 00:13:22,904
to the Oakland school district.

315
00:13:22,904 --> 00:13:24,143
Can you tell me about it?

316
00:13:24,143 --> 00:13:26,915
- Yeah, we're going to be
introducing a new reading program,

317
00:13:26,915 --> 00:13:29,807
which we expect to increase our test rates

318
00:13:29,807 --> 00:13:31,682
at least 10 to 20% in the next year.

319
00:13:31,682 --> 00:13:32,603
- That's great.

320
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:34,813
How are you doing your job so far?

321
00:13:34,813 --> 00:13:35,832
- Oh, it's been wonderful.

322
00:13:35,832 --> 00:13:36,981
I really enjoy it.

323
00:13:36,981 --> 00:13:38,391
- {Jessica] This is your
first year and you've

324
00:13:38,391 --> 00:13:42,112
already made great strides and
changes within five months.

325
00:13:42,112 --> 00:13:43,669
- [Renee] Well, I'd like to
thank my leadership team.

326
00:13:43,669 --> 00:13:45,011
Who's worked under me.

327
00:13:45,011 --> 00:13:45,998
They've been great.

328
00:13:45,998 --> 00:13:48,171
And all our proposals as well.

329
00:13:48,171 --> 00:13:50,400
I'm always challenging them
and working closely with all

330
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,589
the department heads.

331
00:13:52,589 --> 00:13:53,581
- [Omari] Okay, cue the host

332
00:13:53,581 --> 00:13:55,581
and tell her to stretch the interview out.

333
00:13:55,581 --> 00:13:56,840
I need eight more minutes.

334
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,501
- [Jessica] How did you make
a difference so quickly?

335
00:13:58,501 --> 00:14:00,981
Was it because of your past acting show?

336
00:14:00,981 --> 00:14:02,837
Renee Gonzales starred

337
00:14:02,837 --> 00:14:04,989
in three Devonaire production movies in

338
00:14:04,989 --> 00:14:08,052
the '80s that all did
well at the box office.

339
00:14:08,052 --> 00:14:10,413
- [Renee] Well I'd just
like to thank Mauro Albano

340
00:14:10,413 --> 00:14:12,312
for taking me underneath his wings

341
00:14:12,312 --> 00:14:13,842
and teaching me how to be assertive

342
00:14:13,842 --> 00:14:15,621
and to believe in myself.

343
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:19,141
Working with him has made
me become a better person.

344
00:14:19,141 --> 00:14:22,133
Initially I graduated
into political science

345
00:14:22,133 --> 00:14:24,181
and minored in English literature.

346
00:14:24,181 --> 00:14:27,341
And when Mario approached
me and I debated it

347
00:14:27,341 --> 00:14:31,122
and then gave it a chance and enjoyed it.

348
00:14:31,122 --> 00:14:33,021
- I like to thank superintendent Renee

349
00:14:33,021 --> 00:14:34,938
for joining us on KDEB.

350
00:14:36,952 --> 00:14:40,831
(Indistinct talking)

351
00:14:40,831 --> 00:14:43,581
(Loud whistling)

352
00:14:49,756 --> 00:14:52,601
(jazz music)

353
00:14:52,601 --> 00:14:54,131
- See I told you we have the best producer

354
00:14:54,131 --> 00:14:55,478
and director in the business.

355
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:57,395
We'll take care of you.

356
00:14:58,251 --> 00:15:00,699
- Well gentlemen, it was
nice to meet you both.

357
00:15:00,699 --> 00:15:02,124
You guys made me look real good out there.

358
00:15:02,124 --> 00:15:05,916
Keep up the excellent work and good luck.

359
00:15:05,916 --> 00:15:07,329
- Hey, I need to get the superintendent

360
00:15:07,329 --> 00:15:11,662
and her lovely assistant
Donna back to their office.

361
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:20,090
- [Receptionist] Chris, Marissa's here.

362
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,150
- Hello, Marissa.

363
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:25,983
- [Marissa] Hi.

364
00:15:25,983 --> 00:15:26,939
- You remember Omari.

365
00:15:26,939 --> 00:15:27,979
- Definitely, hi Omari.

366
00:15:27,979 --> 00:15:29,646
- How are you doin'?

367
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:32,640
- Well I'm gonna go ahead
and break down the set.

368
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,819
Chris, I'll see ya later.

369
00:15:33,819 --> 00:15:35,160
- All right, man.

370
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:38,077
- Definitely good seeing you again.

371
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,211
- [Narrator] By now Marissa and Chris

372
00:15:40,211 --> 00:15:41,731
were in a relationship.

373
00:15:41,731 --> 00:15:45,029
Chris was crazy about Marissa.

374
00:15:45,029 --> 00:15:47,279
(R&B song)

375
00:15:56,205 --> 00:16:00,288
- Viv, let me know when
the interview is on okay?

376
00:16:02,818 --> 00:16:05,401
- Hey Shawna. It's on. It's on.

377
00:16:06,618 --> 00:16:10,536
- [On TV] Hello, I'm Jessica
here with superintendent....

378
00:16:10,536 --> 00:16:12,619
Hey, this is pretty good.

379
00:16:13,528 --> 00:16:15,877
This is really good.

380
00:16:15,877 --> 00:16:17,946
This is your work.
- Yes.

381
00:16:17,946 --> 00:16:21,029
Be right back, I'm gonna call my dad.

382
00:16:24,782 --> 00:16:26,932
Dad! You need to see this
interview on channel three

383
00:16:26,932 --> 00:16:28,795
it is off the hook.

384
00:16:28,795 --> 00:16:30,195
Take notice of the director.

385
00:16:30,195 --> 00:16:33,035
Maybe be interest to you someday.

386
00:16:33,035 --> 00:16:34,474
All right. Love you.

387
00:16:34,474 --> 00:16:35,307
Bye bye.

388
00:16:38,862 --> 00:16:41,043
The guys that are producing
this really have their stuff

389
00:16:41,043 --> 00:16:44,485
together. One of the guys'
named Omari, the director.

390
00:16:44,485 --> 00:16:45,652
He is so cute.

391
00:16:46,522 --> 00:16:48,352
- So what's up with this guy?

392
00:16:48,352 --> 00:16:49,970
- I don't know.

393
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:52,090
- [Narrator] Shawna was the
Superintendent's PR person.

394
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:54,450
Shawna was very successful
at the age of 26.

395
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:57,210
Her father was a top TV
executive in the bay area.

396
00:16:57,210 --> 00:16:59,781
Vivian was Shawna's good
friend from college and

397
00:16:59,781 --> 00:17:01,129
an established accountant.

398
00:17:01,129 --> 00:17:04,445
She came to visit for two
weeks, as quiet as it was kept,

399
00:17:04,445 --> 00:17:06,561
Shawna was attracted to Omari.

400
00:17:06,561 --> 00:17:08,536
(girls chanting a cheer)

401
00:17:08,536 --> 00:17:11,286
- [Both] Can I get a whoop whoop!

402
00:17:13,886 --> 00:17:16,573
(light music)

403
00:17:16,573 --> 00:17:20,573
- Girl's here man, start
shooting in 10 minutes.

404
00:17:21,848 --> 00:17:24,013
Yeah, I guess. Since Marissa and I

405
00:17:24,013 --> 00:17:24,983
have been get serious I feel

406
00:17:24,983 --> 00:17:29,863
little bit weird about this,
but she knows what we're doing.

407
00:17:29,863 --> 00:17:32,502
- You did tell her that
this was your idea, right?

408
00:17:32,502 --> 00:17:34,655
That you needed a partner. I mean,

409
00:17:34,655 --> 00:17:36,775
you conned me into doing this.

410
00:17:36,775 --> 00:17:39,103
- It's all good. It's all good.

411
00:17:39,103 --> 00:17:42,514
It's no big deal. I just
feel a little different.

412
00:17:42,514 --> 00:17:44,347
Let's go kick his ass.

413
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:49,785
(laughing and chatting)

414
00:17:49,785 --> 00:17:51,253
- Give it to me baby.

415
00:17:51,253 --> 00:17:55,033
- Give it to you? Hey we ain't
even started filming yet.

416
00:17:55,033 --> 00:17:56,283
You don't care.

417
00:17:58,557 --> 00:17:59,807
You don't care.

418
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:05,790
- All right you guys ready to roll now?

419
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:23,980
- Hey man, the footage we did is great.

420
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:25,558
I'm going to edit it tomorrow night.

421
00:18:25,558 --> 00:18:27,886
We'll have our first porn in the can.

422
00:18:27,886 --> 00:18:30,964
- Man, that was to easy,
make some real for this.

423
00:18:30,964 --> 00:18:32,165
- I know we just got to keep this quiet.

424
00:18:32,165 --> 00:18:33,096
All right.

425
00:18:33,096 --> 00:18:34,404
I'm going to a party at my friend's house.

426
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:35,866
He's having a rave.

427
00:18:35,866 --> 00:18:36,737
There's a band playing.

428
00:18:36,737 --> 00:18:38,958
They might want us to do their video.

429
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:42,604
- Well, I guess I'm going
to slide, but rave party?

430
00:18:42,604 --> 00:18:45,036
- I know it's different,
but you're open minded.

431
00:18:45,036 --> 00:18:47,276
You'll be all right.

432
00:18:47,276 --> 00:18:49,526
- Well I don't have a booty call tonight.

433
00:18:49,526 --> 00:18:50,806
So what the hell?

434
00:18:50,806 --> 00:18:51,639
- Cool.

435
00:18:51,639 --> 00:18:52,472
- What about your girl Marissa?

436
00:18:52,472 --> 00:18:54,796
- Ah she's out of town on a
teacher's resource program,

437
00:18:54,796 --> 00:18:56,708
she goes to all those things.

438
00:18:56,708 --> 00:18:57,541
I really like that.

439
00:18:57,541 --> 00:18:59,812
A woman who's doing
things and on the move.

440
00:18:59,812 --> 00:19:01,847
- Yeah you got a cool one
dawg, don't let her go.

441
00:19:01,847 --> 00:19:02,680
- Never.

442
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,291
- Check it out, I'll
stop by the crib so I can

443
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:06,372
get a sweater or something.

444
00:19:06,372 --> 00:19:07,451
- Sounds great.

445
00:19:07,451 --> 00:19:09,950
- Alright?
- Let's go.

446
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:12,130
- [Narrator] Well, this
isn't a rave party.

447
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:16,071
It's more like a band
playing in somebody's loft.

448
00:19:16,071 --> 00:19:19,571
(band playing rock style)

449
00:19:34,184 --> 00:19:37,767
(indistinct party chatter)

450
00:19:41,939 --> 00:19:43,398
Madeline is a mistress.

451
00:19:43,398 --> 00:19:44,460
She is with her two clients and

452
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:47,588
she is in for a pleasant surprise.

453
00:19:47,588 --> 00:19:50,838
(rock music continues)

454
00:19:59,377 --> 00:20:02,460
- Like I said, this party ain't shit.

455
00:20:06,277 --> 00:20:07,613
- Chris? What happened?

456
00:20:07,613 --> 00:20:11,991
Chris' old fling Dasia. She
was crazy for some Chris.

457
00:20:11,991 --> 00:20:12,991
- I'm sorry.

458
00:20:13,965 --> 00:20:15,814
- Why are you doing this to me for?

459
00:20:15,814 --> 00:20:18,896
- Look, I got a girlfriend.

460
00:20:18,896 --> 00:20:23,146
- Seriously, you got a
girlfriend? Oh yeah come on.

461
00:20:23,997 --> 00:20:25,334
Since when?

462
00:20:25,334 --> 00:20:27,334
(claps)

463
00:20:33,396 --> 00:20:36,229
(music continues)

464
00:20:40,179 --> 00:20:42,299
- [Woman] Let's dance.

465
00:20:42,299 --> 00:20:43,966
- To this?
- Come on.

466
00:20:51,712 --> 00:20:54,545
(music continues)

467
00:20:55,852 --> 00:20:57,658
- Come home with me tonight.

468
00:20:57,658 --> 00:20:59,449
- Come again?

469
00:20:59,449 --> 00:21:01,655
- You heard me. Don't make me beg.

470
00:21:01,655 --> 00:21:03,202
Come home with me tonight.

471
00:21:03,202 --> 00:21:06,063
- No, you tell somebody you
need to ask the something.

472
00:21:06,063 --> 00:21:08,480
- Yea. So. Why? I need a man.

473
00:21:09,762 --> 00:21:11,262
I need a real man.

474
00:21:13,251 --> 00:21:16,751
I guess I'd be a fool to pass this up. Yo.

475
00:21:24,593 --> 00:21:26,704
Wait right there.

476
00:21:26,704 --> 00:21:29,987
- So tell me, what are
you up to these days?

477
00:21:29,987 --> 00:21:31,312
- I'm working for the station.

478
00:21:31,312 --> 00:21:32,145
- Oh yeah which one?

479
00:21:32,145 --> 00:21:34,753
- Chris, chris, chris. I'm headed out.

480
00:21:34,753 --> 00:21:37,895
- Getting with that mistress,
don't let her tie you up man.

481
00:21:37,895 --> 00:21:40,211
You know, she's into that shit.

482
00:21:40,211 --> 00:21:41,944
(Omari mouths something at Chris)

483
00:21:41,944 --> 00:21:42,902
Well go take care of your business then

484
00:21:42,902 --> 00:21:46,368
- I am and I just want to
let you know, man alright?

485
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:49,168
- It's cool.
- Cool. Alright.

486
00:21:49,168 --> 00:21:53,251
(music resumes and party noises)

487
00:22:02,751 --> 00:22:05,584
(music continues)

488
00:22:17,381 --> 00:22:19,267
- Got some great news man, we got

489
00:22:19,267 --> 00:22:21,099
a distributor for the video.

490
00:22:21,099 --> 00:22:24,104
They cut us a check for 10 grand already.

491
00:22:24,104 --> 00:22:25,027
- No shit.

492
00:22:25,027 --> 00:22:26,396
And they broke us up?

493
00:22:26,396 --> 00:22:28,717
- Oh man. They loved our style.

494
00:22:28,717 --> 00:22:31,424
They said anything we do they'll buy.

495
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:32,525
- Great.

496
00:22:32,525 --> 00:22:35,064
- So when you write me off?

497
00:22:35,064 --> 00:22:36,874
- Let's do it at lunchtime.

498
00:22:36,874 --> 00:22:37,707
- Cool.

499
00:22:39,173 --> 00:22:40,536
Shit was too easy, dude.

500
00:22:40,536 --> 00:22:41,369
- I know.

501
00:22:42,314 --> 00:22:44,536
So we got to do some more. Definitely.

502
00:22:44,536 --> 00:22:45,576
I mean, this is just the beginning.

503
00:22:45,576 --> 00:22:48,325
I can see my dreams coming true.

504
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:50,616
- It's all good. Let's
get one thing straight.

505
00:22:50,616 --> 00:22:52,454
I don't plan on making this no career.

506
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:55,114
I just want some quick chips.
I can invest in some property.

507
00:22:55,114 --> 00:22:55,947
- I know. I know.

508
00:22:55,947 --> 00:22:58,586
That's exactly what I'm
thinking in and out.

509
00:22:58,586 --> 00:23:01,896
Cause my girl was definitely
not my a biggest fan.

510
00:23:01,896 --> 00:23:03,888
- Hey, my two favorite employees, listen,

511
00:23:03,888 --> 00:23:05,357
I got some great news.

512
00:23:05,357 --> 00:23:08,288
We have just been nominated
for the Peabody award.

513
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:10,738
Just get off the phone with
the superintendent's office.

514
00:23:10,738 --> 00:23:13,338
And it looks like we're one
of three finalists out of 100

515
00:23:13,338 --> 00:23:15,171
stations and get this.

516
00:23:16,098 --> 00:23:18,098
That's not even a big part if we win.

517
00:23:18,098 --> 00:23:21,765
We get a donation of over
$5 million to the studio.

518
00:23:21,765 --> 00:23:24,149
You know? I'm talking state
of the art equipment and

519
00:23:24,149 --> 00:23:26,928
of course raises for
everybody, including me.

520
00:23:26,928 --> 00:23:28,997
Listen, you guys are
doing some great work.

521
00:23:28,997 --> 00:23:31,287
Keep it up. And we're going to be on top.

522
00:23:31,287 --> 00:23:34,560
I mean that, I mean that for real.

523
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:37,224
I'm thinking I want to have a
four o'clock meeting all staff

524
00:23:37,224 --> 00:23:39,345
meeting, so please make
sure everybody's there.

525
00:23:39,345 --> 00:23:41,466
I got to go have lunch
with the superintendent.

526
00:23:41,466 --> 00:23:43,505
And if you lined that up for me,

527
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:45,125
I'm gonna make an announcement
to everybody. Okay?

528
00:23:45,125 --> 00:23:47,292
Later gentlemen.
- See ya.

529
00:23:50,422 --> 00:23:52,565
- I'm going to say today
was a good day, man.

530
00:23:52,565 --> 00:23:53,927
- It sure was.

531
00:23:53,927 --> 00:23:54,760
Man.

532
00:23:55,922 --> 00:23:57,224
We are coming up man.

533
00:23:57,224 --> 00:23:59,392
I told you when we hooked up,
we would kick up some dust.

534
00:23:59,392 --> 00:24:01,090
That's exactly what we're doing.

535
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:04,810
- Hey, Hey man, this is
Friday going on this weekend.

536
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:07,108
You owe me a party.

537
00:24:07,108 --> 00:24:09,901
I want to show you how real
mother fuckers do it. All right?

538
00:24:09,901 --> 00:24:11,042
- Can I bring my girl?

539
00:24:11,042 --> 00:24:13,560
- I ain't trippin, but you will come.

540
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,421
- If I can bring my woman. I'll be there.

541
00:24:15,421 --> 00:24:17,032
- Party is Friday night.

542
00:24:17,032 --> 00:24:18,362
Let's do it after work. All right.

543
00:24:18,362 --> 00:24:20,627
- Sounds like a plan.

544
00:24:20,627 --> 00:24:22,442
It's almost lunchtime.

545
00:24:22,442 --> 00:24:23,942
Let's go get paid.

546
00:24:26,453 --> 00:24:29,450
- I see this shit, but I don't believe it.

547
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:32,117
- Come on. Let's go to the bank.

548
00:24:37,192 --> 00:24:39,712
- [Narrator] The mobsters. These
guys run the porn industry.

549
00:24:39,712 --> 00:24:43,962
They need to speak with
Omari and Chris about fees.

550
00:24:51,104 --> 00:24:53,984
- Man what the fuck is this?

551
00:24:53,984 --> 00:24:56,913
- [Chris] The fuck are you guys?

552
00:24:56,913 --> 00:25:00,207
- Shut the fuck up and listen.

553
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:04,505
You guys are cutting
into our porn business.

554
00:25:04,505 --> 00:25:07,605
No, we want our cut or we'll put you punks

555
00:25:07,605 --> 00:25:08,905
out of the business forever.

556
00:25:08,905 --> 00:25:11,176
- Man fuck you. Don't tell him.

557
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:14,675
(men fighting and cussing)

558
00:25:14,675 --> 00:25:16,085
- That's enough

559
00:25:16,085 --> 00:25:17,252
That's enough.

560
00:25:20,285 --> 00:25:22,035
Hey kid, pick him up.

561
00:25:24,067 --> 00:25:26,984
I'm going to tell me one more time.

562
00:25:28,352 --> 00:25:31,664
We want 20% of every
single movie you guys make.

563
00:25:31,664 --> 00:25:35,475
And by the way we know you work at KDEB.

564
00:25:35,475 --> 00:25:38,142
Don't have us get them involved.

565
00:25:39,475 --> 00:25:41,475
It's just one like that.

566
00:25:42,355 --> 00:25:45,022
And that's your guys' ultimatum.

567
00:25:54,897 --> 00:25:57,456
- You know? (laughing)

568
00:25:57,456 --> 00:25:59,873
You guys do really good work.

569
00:26:01,642 --> 00:26:03,059
Nice pussy I see.

570
00:26:04,781 --> 00:26:06,614
Keep up the good work.

571
00:26:11,122 --> 00:26:14,789
- Well, I guess gentlemen,
we're in cahoots.

572
00:26:17,067 --> 00:26:20,317
(struggling, fighting)

573
00:26:32,403 --> 00:26:36,070
- I ain't take that
shit man. Fuck that man.

574
00:26:37,843 --> 00:26:42,260
- How the fuck did they find
us? Did you tell anyone?

575
00:26:44,881 --> 00:26:49,214
- Okay, maybe I might've
talked, but I'll handle it.

576
00:26:51,324 --> 00:26:54,157
- Loose lips sink ships man. Fuck!

577
00:26:57,742 --> 00:27:02,492
(party chatter and poker chips slamming)

578
00:27:03,343 --> 00:27:05,042
- You know what I'm saying?

579
00:27:05,042 --> 00:27:06,015
- Makes you, I get that man.

580
00:27:06,015 --> 00:27:07,764
- You know what I'm saying?
Doing too much over here.

581
00:27:07,764 --> 00:27:10,083
- You know what I'm saying?
I'm going to slow your roll.

582
00:27:10,083 --> 00:27:11,697
- Let's do this.

583
00:27:11,697 --> 00:27:14,864
(overlapping chatter)

584
00:27:17,572 --> 00:27:19,964
- Philippe, Omari's real
cousin in the black shirt

585
00:27:19,964 --> 00:27:22,693
and big time baller and
shot-caller in the town.

586
00:27:22,693 --> 00:27:24,975
Omar is the only one
that calls him Philippe.

587
00:27:24,975 --> 00:27:27,392
Everyone else calls him, bro.

588
00:27:28,645 --> 00:27:33,645
- [P] So, this is Omari, this
is Lay-Low, Raheem and Stack.

589
00:27:34,165 --> 00:27:37,705
Alright let's get back in his game, man.

590
00:27:37,705 --> 00:27:39,945
(overlapping chatter)

591
00:27:39,945 --> 00:27:41,388
- Come on dawg, it's on you.

592
00:27:41,388 --> 00:27:42,305
- Phillipe.

593
00:27:44,721 --> 00:27:46,331
- Yo, slow your roll.

594
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:47,910
Gentlemen, we need to
put this game on hold.

595
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:50,443
- What? What you mean? Come on, man.

596
00:27:50,443 --> 00:27:53,288
(overlapping arguing)

597
00:27:53,288 --> 00:27:55,316
- I gotta talk to my cousin.
You know what I'm saying?

598
00:27:55,316 --> 00:27:57,827
Come on man, let me have my business, man.

599
00:27:57,827 --> 00:27:59,243
- Hold on man. We can take a break, man.

600
00:27:59,243 --> 00:28:03,570
Let's just go and let
you handle your business.

601
00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:07,820
(overlapping chatting and arguing)

602
00:28:10,711 --> 00:28:11,544
All right.

603
00:28:14,644 --> 00:28:15,644
Have a seat.

604
00:28:17,859 --> 00:28:20,300
So what's on your mind.

605
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:21,966
- Man, I just got jumped
by some mother fuckers

606
00:28:21,966 --> 00:28:24,630
who said they run the porn business.

607
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:29,190
They know what the KDEB and
they know about my boss.

608
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:30,480
You're the only person
that knew about the porns

609
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:33,051
and where I worked at.

610
00:28:33,051 --> 00:28:35,811
It's like you set me up for something.

611
00:28:35,811 --> 00:28:37,563
- You know I wouldn't do that.

612
00:28:37,563 --> 00:28:40,963
And we'd family don't ever think that,

613
00:28:40,963 --> 00:28:43,363
but let me tell you something.

614
00:28:43,363 --> 00:28:47,946
It's my bad. Maybe I'll gave
up a little too much info.

615
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,160
Like you fuck me up before
I could even get started.

616
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:51,993
You know?

617
00:28:53,088 --> 00:28:55,350
I ain't got time for fucking with the mob.

618
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:56,501
The fuck am I supposed to do?

619
00:28:56,501 --> 00:28:57,798
- Man don't worry about that.

620
00:28:57,798 --> 00:28:59,048
I told y'all I'll handle it.

621
00:28:59,048 --> 00:29:02,465
I got you into this and I'll get you out.

622
00:29:03,509 --> 00:29:04,648
- What'd you saying?

623
00:29:04,648 --> 00:29:06,622
You got wires on these
phones or something?

624
00:29:06,622 --> 00:29:09,817
- Maybe, maybe not, but check it man.

625
00:29:09,817 --> 00:29:14,142
You know when I went out for
the baseball team in jr high?

626
00:29:14,142 --> 00:29:15,458
Man, the only reason I went out there,

627
00:29:15,458 --> 00:29:16,291
cause I wanted to hang
with, you know, you made

628
00:29:16,291 --> 00:29:19,624
the family proud, good grades in school.

629
00:29:22,098 --> 00:29:23,566
You did good on the team.

630
00:29:23,566 --> 00:29:25,858
And you finished college.

631
00:29:25,858 --> 00:29:27,867
You know, I started bragging,

632
00:29:27,867 --> 00:29:29,779
bragging to everybody about what you did.

633
00:29:29,779 --> 00:29:31,167
You know? The porn you guys was doing,

634
00:29:31,167 --> 00:29:34,091
you know things you guys was doing.

635
00:29:34,091 --> 00:29:37,421
And I guess now they want
a piece of your action.

636
00:29:37,421 --> 00:29:39,192
- I didn't even know these guys.

637
00:29:39,192 --> 00:29:42,651
- He wants to time up to sound real.

638
00:29:42,651 --> 00:29:44,079
And that's when I met him.

639
00:29:44,079 --> 00:29:46,408
He was investing in the porn industry,

640
00:29:46,408 --> 00:29:48,285
something onto his money.

641
00:29:48,285 --> 00:29:51,696
Now him and his boys is
running the whole bay area.

642
00:29:51,696 --> 00:29:52,734
- It's fine and everything.

643
00:29:52,734 --> 00:29:54,717
But how did he find out about my boss?

644
00:29:54,717 --> 00:29:56,358
- I don't know man.

645
00:29:56,358 --> 00:30:01,264
Well, what I do know is that
the so called friend of mine.

646
00:30:01,264 --> 00:30:04,431
Oh, he's going to straighten this out.

647
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:09,945
- You saying I can do my porns?

648
00:30:09,945 --> 00:30:11,123
- Handle your business.

649
00:30:11,123 --> 00:30:11,956
You know what I'm saying?

650
00:30:11,956 --> 00:30:16,347
Handle your business and I'll
handle mine. We family right?

651
00:30:16,347 --> 00:30:20,112
You know what I'm saying? It's cool.

652
00:30:20,112 --> 00:30:21,488
- I'm just nervous man.

653
00:30:21,488 --> 00:30:24,321
- I hear you, but I got your back.

654
00:30:25,758 --> 00:30:28,841
(sitcom style music)

655
00:30:29,798 --> 00:30:32,548
(doorbell rings)

656
00:30:35,521 --> 00:30:38,021
(rings again)

657
00:30:42,475 --> 00:30:45,308
(music continues)

658
00:30:58,904 --> 00:31:00,567
(knocking)

659
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:02,285
- [Chris] Who is it?

660
00:31:02,285 --> 00:31:04,285
- [Omari] It's me Omari.

661
00:31:05,836 --> 00:31:06,964
- Who is it?

662
00:31:06,964 --> 00:31:08,464
- [Omari] Oh-mar-i

663
00:31:13,392 --> 00:31:14,725
We need to talk.

664
00:31:21,071 --> 00:31:23,121
- All right. What's up.

665
00:31:23,121 --> 00:31:25,591
- I got a lot on my mind, dude.

666
00:31:25,591 --> 00:31:27,551
I got let some of this bullshit out.

667
00:31:27,551 --> 00:31:30,239
Let's go play some basketball.

668
00:31:30,239 --> 00:31:31,677
- Right now?

669
00:31:31,677 --> 00:31:33,148
It's midnight.

670
00:31:33,148 --> 00:31:34,439
Are you nuts?

671
00:31:34,439 --> 00:31:37,606
- Maybe, but that's what I need to do.

672
00:31:39,388 --> 00:31:42,417
- Alright. Yeah, we do need to talk.

673
00:31:42,417 --> 00:31:45,336
Maybe a game would ease my mind too.

674
00:31:45,336 --> 00:31:46,419
- Thanks man.

675
00:31:48,918 --> 00:31:52,027
- Go ahead and shoot,
we'll see who goes first.

676
00:31:52,027 --> 00:31:54,677
- We're playing 21 man, and
since you drug my ass out here,

677
00:31:54,677 --> 00:31:56,260
I'm shooting first.

678
00:32:00,707 --> 00:32:01,957
- Yeah. Oh man.

679
00:32:05,886 --> 00:32:10,235
(cheers of success and sounds
of basketball hoops swishing)

680
00:32:10,235 --> 00:32:13,318
(hip hop song plays)

681
00:32:29,122 --> 00:32:30,862
- [Narrator] I guess this game
represents the frustration

682
00:32:30,862 --> 00:32:33,445
of two people being in cahoots.

683
00:32:44,874 --> 00:32:49,207
(hip hop sing continues throughout)

684
00:33:11,901 --> 00:33:16,901
- Yo, found out what was going
for, shits gonna get hairy.

685
00:33:17,193 --> 00:33:19,504
- How'd you find out so fast?

686
00:33:19,504 --> 00:33:21,171
- No, I got my ways.

687
00:33:23,315 --> 00:33:26,195
- I hope that means we
won't see him anymore.

688
00:33:26,195 --> 00:33:27,195
- I hope so.

689
00:33:30,634 --> 00:33:31,467
I was kind of thinking about

690
00:33:31,467 --> 00:33:33,433
getting out of the porn business.

691
00:33:33,433 --> 00:33:35,766
- What you're joking. Right?

692
00:33:36,751 --> 00:33:39,142
- Man this shit is fucking crazy.

693
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:41,059
Not feeling it no more.

694
00:33:42,521 --> 00:33:44,841
- You're going to walk
away from all this money.

695
00:33:44,841 --> 00:33:46,174
We just started.

696
00:33:47,331 --> 00:33:50,581
- I want out man, I'm serious I'm done.

697
00:33:52,171 --> 00:33:53,793
- After all I've done for you.

698
00:33:53,793 --> 00:33:55,441
You're going to turn your back on me.

699
00:33:55,441 --> 00:33:56,832
Where's your integrity?

700
00:33:56,832 --> 00:33:58,999
- Fuck some integrity man.

701
00:34:01,010 --> 00:34:03,772
My gut feeling is telling
me not to do this dude.

702
00:34:03,772 --> 00:34:06,612
Besides, what about Jesus?

703
00:34:06,612 --> 00:34:07,702
- Man, I'll pay those goons,

704
00:34:07,702 --> 00:34:10,182
whatever they want to
keep our names out of it.

705
00:34:10,182 --> 00:34:13,332
It's only 20%. It's not that bad.

706
00:34:13,332 --> 00:34:14,790
- Well, I may have fucked that up too.

707
00:34:14,790 --> 00:34:16,957
- What?
- I told my cousin.

708
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:21,282
And he told the goons.

709
00:34:21,282 --> 00:34:22,623
- What were you thinking?

710
00:34:22,623 --> 00:34:23,476
- I don't know.

711
00:34:23,476 --> 00:34:25,516
I wasn't thinking.

712
00:34:25,516 --> 00:34:26,426
Look, I told him,

713
00:34:26,426 --> 00:34:31,053
but I didn't know what was
gonna lead to all this man.

714
00:34:31,053 --> 00:34:32,279
I just want to squash everything and

715
00:34:32,279 --> 00:34:34,118
get out plain and simple.

716
00:34:34,118 --> 00:34:36,889
- No, I'm not going to let
you walk away from this man.

717
00:34:36,889 --> 00:34:40,140
We can make way too much money
and we can invest that money.

718
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:43,254
Be set the rest of our lives, man.

719
00:34:43,254 --> 00:34:44,837
It's just one year.

720
00:34:45,919 --> 00:34:48,169
Let's do this for one year.

721
00:34:49,008 --> 00:34:50,479
- What about your girl?

722
00:34:50,479 --> 00:34:52,111
- My girl's got nothing
to do with this man.

723
00:34:52,111 --> 00:34:54,629
She knows what we're doing. She
also knows before I met her,

724
00:34:54,629 --> 00:34:58,122
this is what I wanted
to do to stack my money.

725
00:34:58,122 --> 00:35:01,122
I'm not going to ride her
back for financial success.

726
00:35:01,122 --> 00:35:02,522
She wants to leave me because of this.

727
00:35:02,522 --> 00:35:06,180
Well then I guess I can't stop her

728
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:07,981
- You're really serious about this shit.

729
00:35:07,981 --> 00:35:09,263
- Hell yeah. I'm serious.

730
00:35:09,263 --> 00:35:11,013
I want to go all out.

731
00:35:12,023 --> 00:35:13,006

00:37:05,626 --> 00:37:08,135

- Leave it alone. I was
wrong. We'll back off alright?

783

00:44:40,369 --> 00:44:43,702
You're going to burn up the whole store!

878
00:44:47,463 --> 00:44:49,963
I will call the police on you!

879
00:44:53,428 --> 00:44:54,828
- [Smoker] Is that Omari?

880
00:44:54,828 --> 00:44:59,809
- Yes girl, that's Omari. Let
me get you to the airport.

881
00:44:59,809 --> 00:45:02,809
(car engine starts)

882
00:45:04,159 --> 00:45:06,742
(sitcom music)

883
00:45:07,789 --> 00:45:09,979
- You are kidding me!

884
00:45:09,979 --> 00:45:11,062
We won? WOO~!

885
00:45:12,541 --> 00:45:13,374
Oh no!

886
00:45:14,770 --> 00:45:16,853
Great, great news. Happy!

887
00:45:18,099 --> 00:45:21,909
Man I'm elated. This is

Thank you so much. Hey, tell

00:45:26,477 --> 00:45:28,804
I appreciate it. And they won't regret it.

891
00:45:28,804 --> 00:45:30,646
We're going to keep up the good work.

892
00:45:30,646 --> 00:45:33,218
I can't wait to tell the staff. Yeah.

893
00:45:33,218 --> 00:45:34,135
Yeah. Okay.

00:45:35,858 --> 00:45:36,890
Thank you. You too.

895
00:45:36,890 --> 00:45:37,723
Bye. Bye.

896
00:45:44,206 --> 00:45:46,758
Hey! Listen up! Listen up.

897
00:45:46,758 --> 00:45:49,161

898
00:45:49,161 --> 00:45:50,295

899
00:45:50,295 --> 00:45:52,700

900
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:55,950
(all cheer and scream)

901
00:46:02,555 --> 00:46:04,055
- [Chris] Oh yeah.

902
00:46:07,137 --> 00:46:09,980
- Hey man. I need to take
the rest of the day off.

903
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:12,401
I got some things I need to
take care of if you know what I

904
00:46:12,401 --> 00:46:13,727
mean?

905
00:46:13,727 --> 00:46:16,967
- Yeah. You do need to
look into that matter.

906
00:46:16,967 --> 00:46:18,657
So go ahead.

907
00:46:18,657 --> 00:46:20,628
Just give me a call tomorrow.

908
00:46:20,628 --> 00:46:21,795
- No problem.
- Or later on tonight.

909
00:46:21,795 --> 00:46:22,952
Let me know. Everything's all good.

00:46:22,952 --> 00:46:26,253
- Alright. Thanks man.
- Alright.

911
00:46:26,253 --> 00:46:28,542
- Hello Omari, are you leaving?

912
00:46:28,542 --> 00:46:31,583
- Hello, and yes. All right.

913
00:46:31,583 --> 00:46:33,114
- Hi.
- Hi sweetheart.

914
00:46:33,114 --> 00:46:33,973
How are you?

915
00:46:33,973 --> 00:46:35,640
- Good. How are you?

916
00:46:37,053 --> 00:46:38,114
- So what's up?

917
00:46:38,114 --> 00:46:41,371
- We won the award for the
best public access station.

918
00:46:41,371 --> 00:46:43,574
I'm getting a raise.

919
00:46:43,574 --> 00:46:46,354
- That's fantastic. Let me
take you out to dinner tonight.

920
00:46:46,354 --> 00:46:48,784
Let's celebrate and you know what I mean?

921
00:46:48,784 --> 00:46:50,451
- That sounds great.

922
00:46:51,563 --> 00:46:52,445
- I'll pick you up at 7:00.

923
00:46:52,445 --> 00:46:53,774
- That's perfect.

924
00:46:53,774 --> 00:46:54,822
That's perfect.

925
00:46:54,822 --> 00:46:57,381
That'll give me enough time
to finish up around here.

926
00:46:57,381 --> 00:46:59,008
- Are you sure 7:00?

927
00:46:59,008 --> 00:47:00,639
- That's perfect.

928
00:47:00,639 --> 00:47:01,921
I'll see you then.

929
00:47:01,921 --> 00:47:03,431
- Bye

930
00:47:03,431 --> 00:47:04,264
- Bye

931
00:47:07,301 --> 00:47:09,016
(guitar music)

932
00:47:09,016 --> 00:47:13,016
(man sings in foreign language)

933
00:47:24,936 --> 00:47:29,227
- Marissa, when I'm with
you. I feel like a new man.

934
00:47:29,227 --> 00:47:30,065
Everything I do now,

935
00:47:30,065 --> 00:47:33,206
I feel like I'm just
wanting to do it for you.

936
00:47:33,206 --> 00:47:36,187
You make me want to be a better man.

937
00:47:36,187 --> 00:47:39,020
- You say the nicest things to me.

938
00:47:43,198 --> 00:47:45,615
(sexy music)

939
00:47:50,377 --> 00:47:52,210
- Let's go for a swim.

940
00:47:56,278 --> 00:47:59,185
(music continues)

941
00:47:59,185 --> 00:48:01,268
(splash)

942
00:48:03,277 --> 00:48:06,277
- Hurry up what are you waiting for?

943
00:48:16,096 --> 00:48:18,179
(splash)

944
00:48:20,916 --> 00:48:25,916
(music continues, laughing
and splashing water)

945
00:48:27,267 --> 00:48:30,856
- Marissa, I hope this night never ends

946
00:48:30,856 --> 00:48:34,096
being with you is incredible.

947
00:48:34,096 --> 00:48:37,455
I want to spend the rest of
my life right here with you.

948
00:48:37,455 --> 00:48:39,056
- Really?

949
00:48:39,056 --> 00:48:39,947
I was feeling the same way,

950
00:48:39,947 --> 00:48:42,237
but they didn't know how to bring it up.

951
00:48:42,237 --> 00:48:46,408
- I felt this way. Since the
first time I laid eyes on you,

952
00:48:46,408 --> 00:48:51,075
like I said before, you make
me want to be a better man.

953
00:48:59,456 --> 00:49:00,976
You tastes great.

954
00:49:00,976 --> 00:49:02,696
- You do too.

955
00:49:02,696 --> 00:49:04,426
I have something else
I wanted to show you,

956
00:49:04,426 --> 00:49:06,843
the best part of the evening.

957
00:49:08,677 --> 00:49:11,094
(sexy music)

958
00:49:26,496 --> 00:49:29,329
(music continues)

959
00:49:44,266 --> 00:49:47,099
(music continues)

960
00:50:02,722 --> 00:50:05,805
- [Chris] Marissa, will you marry me?

961
00:50:07,065 --> 00:50:09,648
(sitcom music)

962
00:50:12,154 --> 00:50:15,654
(indistinct conversation)

963
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:22,027
- Hey how you doing?

964
00:50:25,402 --> 00:50:26,735
- How you doing?

965
00:50:27,653 --> 00:50:29,893
And Omari! How you doing?

966
00:50:29,893 --> 00:50:31,222
- You looking good today.

967
00:50:31,222 --> 00:50:32,796
- Awe well thank you, you
say the nicest things.

968
00:50:32,796 --> 00:50:35,487
Honey you know I'm tired,
it's been a long day.

969
00:50:35,487 --> 00:50:37,009
But Omari don't be a
stranger, come back and

970
00:50:37,009 --> 00:50:40,616
you know how Bill loves
your company. You take care!

971
00:50:40,616 --> 00:50:43,233
- Alright take care!
- Okay Buh-bye.

972
00:50:43,233 --> 00:50:46,900
(music drowns out dialogue)

973
00:50:52,271 --> 00:50:54,288
- All right you guys,
here's the situation.

974
00:50:54,288 --> 00:50:56,192
Blackbird distribution wants
to give us half a million

975
00:50:56,192 --> 00:50:59,698
dollars for four videos.
I say we jump on this.

976
00:50:59,698 --> 00:51:02,128
If do it we're going to have to pay off.

977
00:51:02,128 --> 00:51:04,957
So as a group, we got to come
up with a decision on that.

978
00:51:04,957 --> 00:51:06,173
- I say, we take it.

979
00:51:06,173 --> 00:51:07,162
Let's give them all their cut.

980
00:51:07,162 --> 00:51:08,722
- [Narrator] Omari and Chris
had hired an accountant

981
00:51:08,722 --> 00:51:12,192
and lawyer to help them with
their finances and legal fees.

982
00:51:12,192 --> 00:51:13,312
- Really doesn't matter to me.

983
00:51:13,312 --> 00:51:14,145
I'm down either way.

984
00:51:14,145 --> 00:51:17,486
- [Omari] Yeah she will, she'll get paid.

985
00:51:17,486 --> 00:51:19,145
Man, you're not the one
out there doing the work

986
00:51:19,145 --> 00:51:21,056
or taking a beat down by the mob.

987
00:51:21,056 --> 00:51:23,104
- Look. Here's what I'm thinking.

988
00:51:23,104 --> 00:51:24,478
We can do 12 videos.

989
00:51:24,478 --> 00:51:27,487
Gross two million dollars, even
after the mob takes the cut.

990
00:51:27,487 --> 00:51:29,146
That's still half a
million in our pockets.

991
00:51:29,146 --> 00:51:32,392
I say we do this now or
it's never going to happen.

992
00:51:32,392 --> 00:51:34,921
- You guys really don't mind paying them?

993
00:51:34,921 --> 00:51:36,004
- Not at all.

994
00:51:37,772 --> 00:51:40,761
- You know once we get involved
they probably won't want to.

995
00:51:40,761 --> 00:51:43,542
- They don't work like
that. Only the skeezy stuff.

996
00:51:43,542 --> 00:51:47,625
Movies and TV. They don't
talk, a porn, no death.

997
00:51:48,662 --> 00:51:50,829
- So I guess she's all in.

998
00:51:52,676 --> 00:51:55,921
Alright count me in, but I'm
only here for one more year.

999
00:51:55,921 --> 00:52:00,150
I'm out I'm dealing with some
other shit, ya'll can have it

1000
00:52:00,150 --> 00:52:02,012
- Let's make some money gentlemen.

1001
00:52:02,012 --> 00:52:05,729
So what's the next shoot,
how bout some new talent?

1002
00:52:05,729 --> 00:52:06,885
- Sounds nice.

1003
00:52:06,885 --> 00:52:11,052
- Some new talent, we'll
mix them in with the old.

1004
00:52:12,989 --> 00:52:14,713
We'll have another meeting in three days.

1005
00:52:14,713 --> 00:52:17,926
Production a couple of days
after that. Is everyone agreed?

1006
00:52:17,926 --> 00:52:19,093
- Cool, great.

1007
00:52:22,979 --> 00:52:24,146
- You alright?

1008
00:52:27,773 --> 00:52:30,356
(sitcom music)

1009
00:52:33,471 --> 00:52:38,471
(all talking loudly,
overlapping, indistinct)

1010
00:52:43,653 --> 00:52:47,820
(continuing to talk indistinctly)

1011
00:52:52,772 --> 00:52:55,584
- Yo check it, this my partner man.

1012
00:52:55,584 --> 00:52:59,400
Laylow here's gonna put
together a music video

1013
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:00,693
and I'm gonna need you to hook him up.

1014
00:53:00,693 --> 00:53:01,903
Give him a good price,
you know what I'm saying?

1015
00:53:01,903 --> 00:53:04,693
- [Narrator] Laylow needed a
music video for his rap group

1016
00:53:04,693 --> 00:53:07,362
and needed Omari's professionalism.

1017
00:53:07,362 --> 00:53:09,103
- That's cool man, see
I thought you was gonna

1018
00:53:09,103 --> 00:53:10,642
say something like 50 Gs.

1019
00:53:10,642 --> 00:53:12,002
- You can give me 50 Gs.

1020
00:53:12,002 --> 00:53:14,297
- Oh nah, nah man, I ain't
trying to break myself, man.

1021
00:53:14,297 --> 00:53:15,780
I'm just trying to make
some money for me. Man.

1022
00:53:15,780 --> 00:53:16,930
You know what I'm saying?

1023
00:53:16,930 --> 00:53:18,430
- You capitalized.

1024
00:53:20,330 --> 00:53:25,330
(all talking loudly,
overlapping, indistinct)

1025
00:53:28,014 --> 00:53:29,974
- That's why I'm trying to
capitalize up on this here shit,

1026
00:53:29,974 --> 00:53:32,146
man I need that for my
video and my commercial.

00:53:32,146 --> 00:53:33,201
You know what I'm saying?

1028
00:53:33,201 --> 00:53:35,827
How long it take to make
something like that?

1029
00:53:35,827 --> 00:53:38,244
- For shooting? Two days max.

1030
00:53:39,855 --> 00:53:41,435

1031
00:53:41,435 --> 00:53:44,455
- Is that right? Uh. Who'd do the casting?

1032
00:53:44,455 --> 00:53:46,816
- Shit we could do the casting.

1033
00:53:46,816 --> 00:53:51,816
(all talking loudly,
overlapping, indistinct)

1034
00:53:58,475 --> 00:53:59,608
- This here, man.

1035
00:53:59,608 --> 00:54:00,566
How they look. So you

1036
00:54:00,566 --> 00:54:02,356
Let me know what you think.

1037

1045
00:55:06,606 --> 00:55:08,166
- You too.
- Hey.

1046
00:55:08,166 --> 00:55:09,136
- [Narrator] Omari and Chris were leaving

1047
00:55:09,136 --> 00:55:10,425
another porn shoot.

1048
00:55:10,425 --> 00:55:14,189
Marissa has been paging Chris all night.

1049
00:55:14,189 --> 00:55:15,598
- You wanna go grab a drink. Celebrate?

1050
00:55:15,598 --> 00:55:17,878
- I can't. Marissa's has been
blown up my pager all day.

1051
00:55:17,878 --> 00:55:19,724
I got to go by her
house and see what's up.

1052
00:55:19,724 --> 00:55:21,305
- Well. Have a good one.

1053
00:55:21,305 --> 00:55:22,138
- All right, man. You too.

1054
00:55:22,138 --> 00:55:24,221
- See you Monday.
- Peace.

1055
00:55:27,134 --> 00:55:29,551
(sexy music)

1056
00:55:32,286 --> 00:55:35,671
- Chris, there's something
I wanted to tell you.

1057
00:55:35,671 --> 00:55:38,207
- Well I know you've been
blowing my pager up all day.

1058
00:55:38,207 --> 00:55:40,401
I just hope it's good news.

1059
00:55:40,401 --> 00:55:43,830
- Well I don't know how
you're going to take it.

1060
00:55:43,830 --> 00:55:48,663
Here, let's go by the pool.
It's more intimate over there.

1061
00:55:49,740 --> 00:55:50,573
Chris.

1062
00:55:51,819 --> 00:55:52,902
I'm pregnant.

1063
00:55:55,926 --> 00:55:57,518
- You're pregnant?

1064
00:55:57,518 --> 00:56:01,095
I know we didn't expect it,
we always use protection.

1065
00:56:01,095 --> 00:56:03,348
- Marissa I feel blessed.

1066
00:56:03,348 --> 00:56:06,723
I mean, I want to spend the
rest of my life with you and

1067
00:56:06,723 --> 00:56:09,404
have children with you. And
now we're on our way there.

1068
00:56:09,404 --> 00:56:10,876
- You're not upset with me at all?

1069
00:56:10,876 --> 00:56:12,933
I mean, we didn't plan that.

1070
00:56:12,933 --> 00:56:15,548
- Marissa, I'm going to ask
you again from the bottom of my

1071
00:56:15,548 --> 00:56:18,317
heart, will you marry me?

1072
00:56:18,317 --> 00:56:19,484
- Yes, I will.

1073
00:56:22,460 --> 00:56:27,460
(all talking loudly,
overlapping, indistinct)

1074
00:56:31,127 --> 00:56:33,127
- Well beautiful people,

1075
00:56:34,632 --> 00:56:39,215
As you all know, time goes
by things change, they grow.

1076
00:56:40,531 --> 00:56:44,281
They evolve, and the
success of this station,

1077
00:56:45,169 --> 00:56:48,045
all of your hard work has got me an offer

1078
00:56:48,045 --> 00:56:51,712
on a general management
position in Georgia.

1079
00:56:52,812 --> 00:56:55,343
I decided to take the job.

1080
00:56:55,343 --> 00:56:58,714
And I wanna take Jessica with me.

1081
00:56:58,714 --> 00:56:59,547
Now hey, I see the concern out there and

1082
00:56:59,547 --> 00:57:02,417
I know you guys are worried, tripping.

1083
00:57:02,417 --> 00:57:04,900
Wondering who's going to be
your new supervisor and what are

1084
00:57:04,900 --> 00:57:06,433
things are going to be like around here.

1085
00:57:06,433 --> 00:57:09,011
And I'm taking that into
consideration and a lot of thoughts

1086
00:57:09,011 --> 00:57:10,928
and you ready for that?

1087
00:57:13,170 --> 00:57:15,471
Your new supervisor is going to be Chris.

1088
00:57:15,471 --> 00:57:20,471
(all talking loudly,
overlapping, indistinct)

1089
00:57:23,420 --> 00:57:27,087
- You definitely deserve
it. You deserve it.

1090
00:57:28,281 --> 00:57:33,281
(all talking loudly,
overlapping, indistinct)

1091
00:57:34,540 --> 00:57:37,097
- You'll be all right.

1092
00:57:37,097 --> 00:57:39,801
Listen, you folks take
the rest of the day off.

1093
00:57:39,801 --> 00:57:42,859
Tomorrow, your new
supervisor will take over

1094
00:57:42,859 --> 00:57:45,503
this meeting is adjourned.

1095
00:57:45,503 --> 00:57:50,503
(all talking loudly,
overlapping, indistinct)

1096
00:57:54,783 --> 00:57:57,366
(sitcom music)

1097
00:57:58,611 --> 00:58:00,172
- So how'd you do tonight?

1098
00:58:00,172 --> 00:58:02,532
- I did good, I made about 15.

1099
00:58:02,532 --> 00:58:04,282
- You did 15 tonight?

1100
00:58:07,782 --> 00:58:11,532
(static drowns out dialogue)

1101
00:58:14,940 --> 00:58:19,940
(all talking loudly,
overlapping, indistinct)

1102
00:58:25,989 --> 00:58:30,989
(all talking loudly,
overlapping, indistinct)

1103
00:58:34,077 --> 00:58:35,307
- Girl you better go over
there and handle your business,

1104
00:58:35,307 --> 00:58:36,997
go talk to that man. You be tripping.

1105
00:58:36,997 --> 00:58:38,605
- I don't know what to say.

1106
00:58:38,605 --> 00:58:42,736
- Hey, check this out, take a
shot of this liquid courage.

1107
00:58:42,736 --> 00:58:45,294
Now go walk your thick ass over there.

1108
00:58:45,294 --> 00:58:47,561
Bars closing, you feel me?

1109
00:58:47,561 --> 00:58:51,270
Handle your business. Bar's closing

1110
00:58:51,270 --> 00:58:54,270
Bar's closing, handle your business.

1111
00:58:55,882 --> 00:59:00,382
- They go hard, man he got
put in that shit like damn.

1112
00:59:01,842 --> 00:59:05,509
(music drowns out dialogue)

1113
00:59:08,304 --> 00:59:13,293
- Ashley, your name is Ashley.
I'm not trying to ignore you.

1114
00:59:13,293 --> 00:59:15,093
I'm just trying to run my establishment.

1115
00:59:15,093 --> 00:59:17,752
There's a lot of wanna be gangsters.

1116
00:59:17,752 --> 00:59:19,981
Part of shiesty individuals
trying to get around.

1117
00:59:19,981 --> 00:59:21,400
You know what I'm saying?
- Alright.

1118
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:24,853
- Women included. You can't take chances.

1119
00:59:24,853 --> 00:59:25,753
- Are you a thug?

1120
00:59:25,753 --> 00:59:27,773
- Yeah, I do what I have to do.

1121
00:59:27,773 --> 00:59:32,522
So if that means being a thug,
maybe about 80%, 10% matters.

1122
00:59:32,522 --> 00:59:35,189
10% being an entrepreneur.

1123
00:59:37,503 --> 00:59:39,653
- Well can I treat you to a private couch

1124
00:59:39,653 --> 00:59:41,486
dance in the backroom?

1125
00:59:42,583 --> 00:59:44,523
- When you say treat you talking about

1126
00:59:44,523 --> 00:59:46,523
I'm not paying no money?

1127
00:59:47,531 --> 00:59:50,502
You know, I don't pay for no lap dance.

1128
00:59:50,502 --> 00:59:55,123
And Ashley need to get the
dances and make that money.

1129
00:59:55,123 --> 00:59:57,400
I'm not sure, there's time
for that three hours ago,

1130
00:59:57,400 --> 00:59:59,419
this is my own time.

1131
00:59:59,419 --> 01:00:03,832
Besides I gotta to take
advantage of this situation.

1132
01:00:03,832 --> 01:00:05,232
I'm into, it's like:

1133
01:00:05,232 --> 01:00:08,741
a guy walking across the
floor of a club and asking the

1134
01:00:08,741 --> 01:00:11,216
girl of his dreams to dance.

1135
01:00:11,216 --> 01:00:14,384
And if she says no, the
rejection is detrimental.

1136
01:00:14,384 --> 01:00:15,704
Don't make me beg Phillipe.

1137
01:00:15,704 --> 01:00:17,765
- Well, I'm not gonna make you beg.

1138
01:00:17,765 --> 01:00:20,624
At least not right now,
but I tell you what,

1139
01:00:20,624 --> 01:00:23,044
I'm going to take you up on that offer.

1140
01:00:23,044 --> 01:00:24,623
You get me back there.

1141
01:00:24,623 --> 01:00:26,403
What are you going to do?

1142
01:00:26,403 --> 01:00:27,435
- Don't worry.

1143
01:00:27,435 --> 01:00:31,424
I won't hurt you. I only
want to bring you pleasure.

1144
01:00:31,424 --> 01:00:34,306
- I could use a little
bit of pleasure right now.

1145
01:00:34,306 --> 01:00:35,681
Let's take this in the back.

1146
01:00:35,681 --> 01:00:37,514
- You won't regret it.

1147
01:00:40,232 --> 01:00:42,455
- [Phillipe] Yo laylow, watch it.

1148
01:00:42,455 --> 01:00:45,818
- We ain't no friends, the
homies can't have none.

1149
01:00:45,818 --> 01:00:49,389
- All right, if that, is in
here. His black ass is mine.

1150
01:00:49,389 --> 01:00:51,391
He thinks he can come
into my club and diss me?

1151
01:00:51,391 --> 01:00:53,054
Fuck him.

1152
01:00:53,054 --> 01:00:55,887
I got something for his black ass.

1153
01:01:01,149 --> 01:01:03,223
- I say we let this shit go
man, let's go fuck with some

1154
01:01:03,223 --> 01:01:07,423
strippers, they got some fine
looking bitches in there man.

1155
01:01:07,423 --> 01:01:09,543
- Damn it Keith. Don't be a pussy.

1156
01:01:09,543 --> 01:01:11,753
And get the fuck out of here
and in that car, we're making

1157
01:01:11,753 --> 01:01:13,775
this club ours tonight.

1158
01:01:13,775 --> 01:01:15,585
If you're gonna be a spineless
mother fucker then get the

1159
01:01:15,585 --> 01:01:16,918
fuck outta here.

1160
01:01:18,226 --> 01:01:20,066
- That's what I'm fucking
talking about, you wanna start

1161
01:01:20,066 --> 01:01:21,718
that shit you're gonna fucking finish it.

1162
01:01:21,718 --> 01:01:22,968
Get with the fucking program will ya.

1163
01:01:22,968 --> 01:01:27,551
Hey man it's cool, I just
wanted some pussy that's all.

1164
01:01:29,532 --> 01:01:31,317
- We're here for business.

1165
01:01:31,317 --> 01:01:33,150
Let's take care of it.

1166
01:01:42,354 --> 01:01:45,437
(club music playing)

1167
01:02:06,694 --> 01:02:09,527
(music continues)

1168
01:02:15,923 --> 01:02:19,590
(music drowns out dialogue)

1169
01:02:24,794 --> 01:02:27,794
(multiple gunshots)

1170
01:02:31,883 --> 01:02:35,633
(gunshots, people screaming)

1171
01:02:42,344 --> 01:02:46,094
(gunshots, people screaming)

1172
01:02:51,148 --> 01:02:54,898
(gunshots, people screaming)

1173
01:02:59,291 --> 01:03:03,958
- SOMEBODY CALL AN AMBULANCE!!
I SAID CALL AN AMBULANCE!

1174
01:03:06,174 --> 01:03:11,036
(man breathing heavily
and trying to speak)

1175
01:03:11,036 --> 01:03:12,668
- [Phillipe] You're going
to be all right, man.

1176
01:03:12,668 --> 01:03:14,539
Remember what I said,
partners in crime for life.

1177
01:03:14,539 --> 01:03:15,640
Partners for life.

1178
01:03:15,640 --> 01:03:19,140
- I told you, I'd die for you. I told you.

1179
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:22,218
- You going to be all right, man.

1180
01:03:22,218 --> 01:03:23,705
GET HIM A DRINK, A DRINK.

1181
01:03:23,705 --> 01:03:26,315
You gonna be alright man. Come on.

1182
01:03:26,315 --> 01:03:27,565
Oh man. LAYLOW!

1183
01:03:28,456 --> 01:03:32,289
(crying and noises of sorrow)

1184
01:03:36,136 --> 01:03:41,136
- Mother fuckers coming
up in here. (gunshot)

1185
01:03:44,041 --> 01:03:46,874
(soft, sad music)

1186
01:03:57,769 --> 01:04:00,602
(music continues)

1187
01:04:12,850 --> 01:04:14,812
- [Narrator] Omari wasn't
able to attend the funeral

1188
01:04:14,812 --> 01:04:17,262
because his grandmother
passed away out of state.

1189
01:04:17,262 --> 01:04:18,151
He wasn't present,

1190
01:04:18,151 --> 01:04:22,401
but Chris and Marissa showed
up on behalf of Omari.

1191
01:04:24,819 --> 01:04:26,799
- I really appreciate you
showing up in your respects

1192
01:04:26,799 --> 01:04:28,890
to my man Laylow.

1193
01:04:28,890 --> 01:04:31,570
- Well Omari couldn't make
it downtown this weekend.

1194
01:04:31,570 --> 01:04:34,821
So we're here to pay our
respects for the both of us.

1195
01:04:34,821 --> 01:04:36,654
Laylow was a good man.

1196
01:04:37,509 --> 01:04:41,176
(music drowns out dialogue)

1197
01:04:42,710 --> 01:04:46,627
- You have a beautiful
angel. Take care of her.

1198
01:04:48,170 --> 01:04:49,837
Meet me at the spot.

1199
01:04:54,631 --> 01:04:56,048
- [Narrator] Rouge and his
crew were still upset about

1200
01:04:56,048 --> 01:05:00,689
Laylow's death and were
definitely going to retaliate.

1201
01:05:00,689 --> 01:05:03,689
(music gets louder)

1202
01:05:15,285 --> 01:05:18,118
(music continues)

1203
01:05:33,381 --> 01:05:36,214
(music continues)

1204
01:05:49,030 --> 01:05:50,772
(music continues underneath)

1205
01:05:50,772 --> 01:05:54,079
- Chris. There's something
I wanted to tell you.

1206
01:05:54,079 --> 01:05:57,361
- Please just no more bad news.

1207
01:05:57,361 --> 01:05:58,902
- Chris since we're
about to start a family

1208
01:05:58,902 --> 01:06:01,265
I want you to get out
of pornography business.

1209
01:06:01,265 --> 01:06:03,021
You said it yourself it's
getting too dangerous.

1210
01:06:03,021 --> 01:06:05,519
You don't think I need that
kind of stress right now?

1211
01:06:05,519 --> 01:06:07,521
I mean I want our child
to have a real father

1212
01:06:07,521 --> 01:06:08,938
not a bad memory.

1213
01:06:11,986 --> 01:06:16,486
- You're probably right,
it's getting way out of hand.

1214
01:06:18,583 --> 01:06:20,250
Omari wants out too.

1215
01:06:22,733 --> 01:06:27,733
- You just got the promotion,
it's just gonna be just fine.

1216
