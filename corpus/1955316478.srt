1
00:01:37,723 --> 00:01:39,393
<i>Home.</i>

2
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:43,850
<i>They say once gone,
you can never return.</i>

3
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:47,316
<i>But what about those like me?</i>

4
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:51,941
<i>Born in the dust,
whose home was the road?</i>

5
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:54,905
<i>No family with whom to share.</i>

6
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:58,411
<i>Like my family,</i>

7
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:04,161
<i>taken from me
by those whom I'd deceived.</i>

8
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:10,801
<i>Tent and totem, I sold them a promise,</i>

9
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:14,722
<i>and in return they sold me themselves.</i>

10
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:20,428
<i>You see, orphans without a god</i>

11
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:23,137
<i>will open their doors
to whomever might knock.</i>

12
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:27,194
<i>Hammer and nail,
we build our heaven.</i>

13
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:31,863
<i>Room by room... our hell.</i>

14
00:02:33,362 --> 00:02:35,322
<i>And so now we build.</i>

15
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:41,446
<i>What a magnificent structure
it will be.</i>

16
00:02:57,177 --> 00:03:00,597
- Look, if this is about my copy...
- It's terrific. You're the best I got.

17
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:02,772
You write like they wrote
back in the day.

18
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:06,771
Cigarettes, little brown hats. Things
that say: "Scoop." No, I love your copy.

19
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:08,685
- So what's this about?
- Your copy.

20
00:03:08,814 --> 00:03:09,984
Jesus, Chester!

21
00:03:10,107 --> 00:03:14,607
I put you on a story about
rising mortgage rates.

22
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:18,356
You are a real estate writer, Talben,
not Woodward at the goddamn post.

23
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:20,330
What I need from you are numbers.

24
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:23,330
Re-fis, jumbos, rates.
What I don't need is color.

25
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:26,833
Black's a color. White's a color.
It's all there in black and white.

26
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:30,087
I'm just trying to make it interesting
for our three readers.

27
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,800
This thing reads
like a murder investigation.

28
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:36,261
- Then put me on crime.
- Doug's on crime. He's got scars.

29
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:38,393
You got ambition and perfect skin.

30
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:43,308
Still no Pulitzer?

31
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:48,194
They don't give Pulitzers for commercial
occupancy rate reports, detective.

32
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:50,401
You don't write, you don't call.

33
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:54,072
I'd be writing now if I didn't have
a talkative cop giving me grief.

34
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:56,860
Ok.

35
00:03:56,987 --> 00:03:59,817
The least I can do,
after you ate all my breakfast cereal.

36
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:01,278
That was another lifetime.

37
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:04,288
- I seem to remember us both there.
- What are you doing here?

38
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:08,251
Eyewitness sketch for Doug. We're using
the press to flush out a suspect.

39
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:10,713
How's Charlie doing? Any improvement?

40
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:12,924
Working on it.

41
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:14,924
We should catch up.

42
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:17,086
Coffee? Bourbon?

43
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:20,675
Raincheck me.
I have dinner at Amanda's house tonight.

44
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:23,762
The sister who overcooks the vegetables.
Tsk.

45
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:25,349
See you later.

46
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:37,315
- There he is.
- Oh, you're home!

47
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,160
Oh, no place I'd rather be.

48
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:44,026
- Hey-
- hey-

49
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:47,412
dinner's almost ready.
Wanna go wash his hands?

50
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:50,037
- Sure. Come on, soldier.
- Yes, sir.

51
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:56,922
- Any response on the story yet?
- Nothing fit to print.

52
00:04:57,047 --> 00:05:01,127
I might have a lead. I got a call from
this adoption agency in the northeast.

53
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:03,589
The administrator read Charlie's story.

54
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:07,095
Any luck on the donor list?

55
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:08,774
Mom's our only hope.

56
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:12,650
Who abandons their children?

57
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:14,651
We're gonna find her.

58
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:17,903
Even if she doesn't wanna be found.
Charlie will be ok.

59
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:19,356
I promise.

60
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:27,538
Ok. Close your eyes.

61
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:29,501
Hands out.

62
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:31,751
- Are you peeking?
- No, I'm not.

63
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:34,383
Ok. Here.

64
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:37,881
- But mom and dad won't let me.
- That's why it's gotta be our secret.

65
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:43,719
Hey, look at me.

66
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:46,474
I'm not gonna let anything
happen to you.

67
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:51,019
I promise. Ok?

68
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:18,712
Lipstick on the collar is one thing.

69
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:21,087
But the ink on your fingertips
wasn't all that different.

70
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:23,884
The paper doesn't let its reporters
get engaged to cops,

71
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:26,509
especially with a history
as complicated as ours.

72
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:28,386
It's a fuck-all conflict of interest.

73
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:30,603
I have a husband and a six-year-old.

74
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:32,734
They conflict
with every interest I have.

75
00:06:34,436 --> 00:06:36,476
- Are you two gossiping?
- She's brooding.

76
00:06:36,605 --> 00:06:39,565
- I'm sulking. It's a whole new thing.
- About what?

77
00:06:39,691 --> 00:06:41,941
I'm ankle deep, and I'm going nowhere.

78
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:45,358
- Doug has crime. I've got nothing.
- That's not true.

79
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:47,278
You have us. Your family.

80
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:50,157
Ambition. Your tenacity.
You got your hopes and dreams.

81
00:06:50,285 --> 00:06:52,445
Hell, I'd kill to have
my hope and dream back.

82
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:54,369
Go start the laundry.

83
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,540
I swear I feel like
I have two children sometimes.

84
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:01,669
That's why I'm not married.

85
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:30,700
Are you following me, detective?

86
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:33,325
Stakeout.

87
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,333
Following a person of interest.

88
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:39,576
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know.
I shouldn't be here, but...

89
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:43,457
...l didn't care.

90
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:47,588
- You're right. You shouldn't be here.
- And I don't care.

91
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:51,300
Old habits die hard.

92
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:56,234
I need time, and you need to heal.

93
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:58,771
You need to stop blaming yourself.

94
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:01,015
You know, what happened...

95
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:03,567
It can't...
Couldn't have been prevented.

96
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:05,442
I sped it along.

97
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:12,424
Julia, her and I were through
before there ever was a you and me.

98
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,137
Aargh!

99
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:20,770
- Charlie?
- Help me! Get off me!

100
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:23,188
Charlie?

101
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:26,153
No! No!

102
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:49,509
There's a call for you. Line two.
The guy says it's urgent.

103
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:53,801
Ok. Kyle, I'm gonna have
to call you back in five.

104
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:04,805
<i>- This is Julia.
- Miss Talben?</i>

105
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:06,860
Who is this?

106
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:08,901
<i>I'm afraid
I've have done something terrible.</i>

107
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:12,815
- I'm sorry?
- So am I.

108
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:14,446
<i>Gravely.</i>

109
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:16,696
To whom am I speaking?

110
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:18,615
<i>I'm the man
who just killed your sister.</i>

111
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:36,263
Amanda! She's not answering.

112
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:42,772
Amanda!

113
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:44,182
Jules, wait.

114
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:51,478
Amanda?

115
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:57,414
- Charlie?!
- Jules, do not go up those stairs.

116
00:10:57,532 --> 00:11:01,202
Shit. What the fuck did you do?

117
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:04,793
Only what I had to.

118
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:06,544
Oh, no.

119
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,036
Amanda? Amanda?

120
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:10,540
Charlie?!

121
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:18,969
No...

122
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:22,805
- Get down! Get down! Don't you move!
- No...

123
00:11:22,974 --> 00:11:24,734
You fuck! Do not move!

124
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:28,482
- Jules?!
- ' No!

125
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:30,311
Moving up!

126
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:54,232
They were a beautiful family.

127
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:04,525
You're all that I have left.

128
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:06,829
You know the same is true for me, right?

129
00:13:08,246 --> 00:13:09,956
Come on. I'm driving.

130
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:21,627
You should eat something.
Why don't we stop at castles?

131
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:23,639
Get some of that pecan pie you like.

132
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:27,351
- I wanna go to Renshaw's.
- Whoa, whoa, absolutely not.

133
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:30,733
The last thing I wanna do
is bring more crazy into your life.

134
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:33,019
Ok.

135
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:36,476
I put my sister and her kid
in the ground today.

136
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:38,977
I need the why.

137
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:40,860
Renshaw is bat shit.

138
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:43,607
Guys like that don't give exposition.

139
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,700
No prize, no motive, no connection.

140
00:14:01,424 --> 00:14:04,804
- The bank sold the house?
- You said they were drowning in debt.

141
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:07,297
I didn't say "drowning."
I said they had bills.

142
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:09,390
Charlie's treatment is expensive.

143
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:14,228
Was expensive.

144
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:20,902
- They didn't own the house.
- The house owned them.

145
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:24,276
It's been less than a week.

146
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:26,315
You can't get through escrow that fast.

147
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:30,949
Not to mention appraisal,
inspection, title, hud-1 form.

148
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:35,040
It's just not possible.

149
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:37,166
Right. A real estate journalist.

150
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,110
Something doesn't feel right.

151
00:15:06,656 --> 00:15:07,736
Huh?

152
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:23,090
Ls somebody in the house?

153
00:15:23,214 --> 00:15:25,594
It sounds like
it's coming from Charlie's room.

154
00:15:28,803 --> 00:15:30,763
Grady?

155
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:38,649
Oh, you've gotta be kidding me.

156
00:15:44,152 --> 00:15:45,782
Goddammit.

157
00:16:02,253 --> 00:16:04,263
Ok, ok. I know I owe you a call.

158
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:08,010
Who the fuck buys a house, and cuts
the entire crime scene out of it?

159
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:12,014
How is that legal?
How do you close escrow in five days?

160
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:15,348
Give me the buyer.
Give me the information, Kyle.

161
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:17,805
Or I will have consumer affairs
so far up your ass,

162
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:19,935
they'll be brushing your teeth.

163
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:32,623
A Po box in town?

164
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:35,618
You need to start talking.

165
00:16:35,745 --> 00:16:38,535
Charlie's room is ripped
out of the goddamn house.

166
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:40,964
You coming in here
talking about rooms being taken,

167
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,923
that's like saying MacBeth
to a Broadway actor.

168
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:47,965
You're gonna tell me a fairytale?
"Once upon a time"?

169
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,930
Realtors are Glengarry guys.

170
00:16:50,051 --> 00:16:51,551
You don't have myths.

171
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:55,813
Right when I started,
I caught this lead.

172
00:16:55,932 --> 00:16:58,772
Some high rise downtown.

173
00:16:58,893 --> 00:17:01,983
Only hitch was
that it was slightly infamous.

174
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:06,364
Seems some husband went sideways
on his wife with a kitchen implement.

175
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:18,291
Ohh!

176
00:17:18,913 --> 00:17:20,413
It was a crime scene?

177
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,880
Oh, he made it one,
that's for damn sure.

178
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:38,524
Unsellable, right?

179
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:41,305
Two days later I'm closing escrow

180
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:44,645
with a guy old enough
to be my great-great-grandfather.

181
00:17:45,523 --> 00:17:48,323
Less than a week later,
the old guy, he flips for a loss.

182
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:51,282
- One renovation.
- The kill room is ripped out.

183
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:54,494
Whole fucking room, gone.

184
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:57,865
Now, you tell this tale,
you hear two more just like it.

185
00:17:57,994 --> 00:18:00,584
And the end of this fairytale
is always the same.

186
00:18:00,705 --> 00:18:04,995
Never heard from the buyer again.
I'd like to keep it that way.

187
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:14,627
Found this in the closing papers.
That's all I got.

188
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:23,853
Now wherever this leads,
make sure it's away from my office.

189
00:18:27,398 --> 00:18:30,858
Alright, you got the city records.
I did you a title search.

190
00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:34,235
12 hits on revelation holdings
over seven states.

191
00:18:37,325 --> 00:18:39,195
Your bus-bench huckster was right.

192
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:43,827
Half a dozen properties bought and sold
by revelation over a 50-year span.

193
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,750
And each one purchased...

194
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:49,707
After a tragic event
occurred in the house.

195
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:53,757
All of the homes did some sort of
remodeling after the crime took place.

196
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:55,933
- And the rooms?
- Taken.

197
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,967
So what's the explanation?

198
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:11,442
When I moved in,
I didn't even have a roof over my head.

199
00:19:12,193 --> 00:19:16,243
- Why? What used to be up there?
- Vaulted ceiling being reinforced.

200
00:19:16,364 --> 00:19:17,914
Antique chandelier.

201
00:19:18,032 --> 00:19:22,042
- I started hearing noises.
- What kind of noises?

202
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:26,331
It was in the hallway
across from the master bedroom.

203
00:19:26,457 --> 00:19:28,957
<i>There was an energy.</i>

204
00:19:29,085 --> 00:19:31,795
Family moved in late-'87, early-'88.

205
00:19:32,797 --> 00:19:35,797
Wasn't till three years later
that the tenants did the math.

206
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:37,675
Points out the obvious.

207
00:19:37,802 --> 00:19:41,762
To hear the neighbors tell it, it was
a speakeasy, a brothel, a drug house,

208
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:43,769
and who knows what else.

209
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:47,731
If something could be done
to offend heaven, it was done here.

210
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:50,693
- What's on the other side of this wall?
- Repairman was working late.

211
00:19:50,815 --> 00:19:53,475
<i>Forgot to cut the power on
the elevator. Crushed the poor bastard.</i>

212
00:19:54,944 --> 00:19:56,784
Damn near broke every bone in his body.

213
00:19:56,904 --> 00:20:00,624
I guess she reckoned she'd rather
go out above the ground than below it.

214
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:06,868
But I did some research that ten years
before I took over the ownership,

215
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:12,415
there was a nasty home invasion.

216
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:22,383
Let us go! Please! Let us go!

217
00:20:22,513 --> 00:20:25,063
Please? Let us go...

218
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,060
Shhh...

219
00:20:39,155 --> 00:20:43,525
Church bought the place back in '82
for a penny and a half.

220
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:46,499
Poisoned by a competing tycoon.

221
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:50,830
Someone came in and removed
the whole room, floor to ceiling.

222
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:53,168
To understand the story,
two days after it happened,

223
00:20:53,294 --> 00:20:54,964
someone offered to buy the building.

224
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:57,877
Owners wanted out,
didn't want the press, so they sold.

225
00:20:58,007 --> 00:21:01,587
And then someone just scampered off
with the entire ceiling?

226
00:21:01,719 --> 00:21:05,429
Two weeks later, elevator's gone,
and the building is back on the market.

227
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:09,063
In your email you mentioned
something about revelation holdings.

228
00:21:09,185 --> 00:21:12,395
The newspaper did take up the story.

229
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:16,981
And the day it went into print,
I get a knock at the door.

230
00:21:18,027 --> 00:21:20,817
<i>A man starts asking me questions.</i>

231
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:25,446
<i>He's more interested in the murders
than the real estate.</i>

232
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:32,620
<i>Two hours later, gives me a check
for 20 percent more than the value.</i>

233
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:39,460
<i>And then the next week, I remembered
that I left a box over there.</i>

234
00:21:53,938 --> 00:21:56,768
<i>And the hallway was gone.</i>

235
00:21:56,899 --> 00:21:58,439
So let me get this straight.

236
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:01,357
- The story bends.
- What do you mean it bends?

237
00:22:01,487 --> 00:22:03,987
Husband slits his wrists
after finding his wife dead in bed.

238
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:07,284
Along comes an old man, buys the house,
rips out the murder room.

239
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:10,999
Contractor shoots the carpenter
eight times in the head with a nail gun

240
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:13,081
before putting a nail into his own eyes.

241
00:22:13,207 --> 00:22:16,337
- Nice touch, tools of the trade.
- Christmas morning, 2004.

242
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:20,630
A husband and wife are opening presents
when their landlord axes them both.

243
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:23,006
- And get this...
- Takes off with the murder room?

244
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:24,433
Yes.

245
00:22:24,552 --> 00:22:26,472
Color me intrigued,
but that's about all.

246
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:29,175
Fucked-up people
collect fucked-up shit, right?

247
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:32,226
Part of his collection
happens to be my family.

248
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:36,402
Which is horrible, but it's faded news.

249
00:22:36,522 --> 00:22:39,362
You can't rewrite that story.
It's already gone to press.

250
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:42,033
Rewrite it?
I haven't even finished a rough draft.

251
00:22:43,821 --> 00:22:47,321
I get it. It's stranger than strange.
It's fucking nuts.

252
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:49,699
But these are all solved murders.

253
00:22:49,827 --> 00:22:53,707
Cases of people taking out
their loved ones, and then themselves.

254
00:22:53,831 --> 00:22:56,381
We had your guy in a padded cell.

255
00:22:57,209 --> 00:23:01,169
He's facing triple murder. That's it.

256
00:23:01,297 --> 00:23:03,877
Case open, case closed.
There's no mystery.

257
00:23:04,008 --> 00:23:06,138
You don't have to protect me, Grady.

258
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,310
I won't break.

259
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:13,774
- I want to see him.
- No.

260
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:14,983
- Yes.
- No.

261
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:18,112
You don't get to make that decision.
I want to see him.

262
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:21,148
Look...

263
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:23,937
I know you're trying to make this right.

264
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:27,779
But whatever it is you're doing,
it's not gonna bring them back.

265
00:23:28,866 --> 00:23:30,656
L just need to see him.

266
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:33,374
If I don't see him
I'm gonna be asking these questions

267
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:35,285
that I'm never gonna
have the answers to.

268
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:38,674
So, please, help me. Please?

269
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:44,132
Alright.
I'll... I'll make some calls, ok?

270
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:46,633
You'll make some calls?

271
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:48,389
You're a cop.

272
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:50,600
You're my cop.

273
00:23:50,721 --> 00:23:52,601
And that was my sister.

274
00:23:53,766 --> 00:23:55,426
Get me in front of him.

275
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:02,939
Shit. Fuck.

276
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:15,582
The adoption agency.

277
00:24:24,046 --> 00:24:26,206
Mother: Eulalia Howard.

278
00:24:27,633 --> 00:24:29,133
New English.

279
00:24:47,528 --> 00:24:49,698
Some people can't do what you're doing.

280
00:24:49,822 --> 00:24:52,162
Believe me, I know what you're doing.

281
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:55,985
43 stories I can confirm.

282
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,910
The earliest one going back to 1953.

283
00:24:59,665 --> 00:25:02,535
My family's death was not random.
It's connected.

284
00:25:04,128 --> 00:25:06,168
Each time a shell company.

285
00:25:06,296 --> 00:25:08,546
No picture, no face.

286
00:25:08,674 --> 00:25:11,844
The guy's a ghost collecting ghosts,
and one of them is my sister.

287
00:25:12,261 --> 00:25:15,681
And this is where I warn you.

288
00:25:15,806 --> 00:25:18,426
You're getting too close
to this one, kiddo.

289
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:23,104
And this is where I ignore you,
and chase it anyway.

290
00:25:29,987 --> 00:25:31,817
This came for you in today's mail.

291
00:25:35,993 --> 00:25:37,163
New English?

292
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:44,706
"Always forward never reverse."

293
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:10,898
I don't need to see anymore of this,
and nor do you. Who sent this?

294
00:26:16,742 --> 00:26:20,082
New English?
Renshaw's last address was new English.

295
00:26:20,204 --> 00:26:22,214
There's no such thing as a coincidence.

296
00:26:22,331 --> 00:26:26,711
The world broke, and you broke with it.
This is your head cobbling the pieces.

297
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:29,415
That repairman Brent Johnson,
who was crushed.

298
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:31,506
Guess where he was from? New English.

299
00:26:31,632 --> 00:26:33,932
The bathtub murders? New English.

300
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:38,257
Guess where I was born?

301
00:26:38,388 --> 00:26:40,468
There's a connection.

302
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:42,979
Look at the evidence and do the math.

303
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:46,097
That's my sister and her family
on that tape.

304
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:50,440
You have the monster behind bars
who did this. I am owed this, Grady.

305
00:26:50,818 --> 00:26:53,988
- What?
- The walls.

306
00:26:54,113 --> 00:26:55,703
What?

307
00:26:55,823 --> 00:26:57,913
Give me this.

308
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:04,962
Look. Look at the walls.
They're not connected.

309
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:09,169
The walls are not connected.

310
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:17,177
Wing's under construction.
I had him moved here for you.

311
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:19,512
A little more private, a lot more safe.

312
00:27:21,265 --> 00:27:24,425
Listen, he gets weird, you get scared,
I'll be right...

313
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,560
- I'm fine.
- Don't get too close.

314
00:27:33,819 --> 00:27:35,609
Could I talk to him alone?

315
00:27:35,737 --> 00:27:40,067
- That ain't happening.
- Please? Just for a few minutes.

316
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,950
I'm fine.

317
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:44,997
Best I can do is down the hall.

318
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:54,800
I don't remember the last time
I slept so well.

319
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:57,433
You fucking monster.

320
00:27:59,261 --> 00:28:03,521
I am. And I feel terrible
about what befell your kin.

321
00:28:06,643 --> 00:28:10,773
I feel worse knowing
what will soon befall you.

322
00:28:15,402 --> 00:28:17,952
I'll watch you burn in hell
for what you did to them.

323
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:21,201
I deserved that, and much worse.

324
00:28:21,325 --> 00:28:24,615
- That tape you sent me...
- I didn't send you any tape.

325
00:28:24,745 --> 00:28:26,615
Liar! Do not lie to me!

326
00:28:26,747 --> 00:28:28,367
I might have caused its creation,

327
00:28:28,498 --> 00:28:31,828
but I had no part in making it,
or sending it to you.

328
00:28:32,753 --> 00:28:36,303
I'm under lock and key here.

329
00:28:37,174 --> 00:28:39,554
- Her room was...
- Was taken.

330
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:42,006
Like so many before it.

331
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:44,717
I have made a barter with him.

332
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:48,848
And now I have a room he cannot take.

333
00:28:49,937 --> 00:28:53,147
He who? Crone?

334
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:56,282
Why did he take her room?

335
00:28:56,401 --> 00:29:00,111
Amanda's room fits into his puzzle.

336
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:03,409
One more tragedy
to add to his collection.

337
00:29:04,201 --> 00:29:08,701
And some souls don't go above a level.
They're stuck.

338
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:13,037
When a person dies unexpectedly,

339
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:17,628
they leave behind a tear in the fabric
of our world like a fracture.

340
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:22,256
You put enough cracks together,
like rooms in a house,

341
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:27,270
all the pain, all the fear,
all the emotions

342
00:29:27,391 --> 00:29:29,561
left behind after death...

343
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:33,516
...they start to turn acidic.

344
00:29:33,647 --> 00:29:38,147
And they echo on themselves
until finally it all collapses.

345
00:29:40,112 --> 00:29:42,282
Knock a hole in a prison wall,

346
00:29:42,406 --> 00:29:45,116
and walk out with all the prisoners.

347
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,000
I'm sorry for what's coming.

348
00:29:51,373 --> 00:29:54,543
God, make it stop!
I have done a horrible thing.

349
00:29:55,585 --> 00:29:58,085
Owl

350
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:02,014
agh!

351
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:05,554
What is he building?
Please just tell me what he's building!

352
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:07,599
The miracle of new English.

353
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:13,480
<i>Listen to me.
I know the sky is falling for you.</i>

354
00:30:14,354 --> 00:30:16,654
But you need to back off,
and let me do my job.

355
00:30:19,401 --> 00:30:21,321
Go home.
I'll be five minutes behind you.

356
00:31:22,923 --> 00:31:24,013
Shit.

357
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:36,603
License and registration.

358
00:31:38,814 --> 00:31:40,944
That's real clever. I like that.

359
00:31:42,192 --> 00:31:45,782
Care to put your feet up in our
well-appointed lounge while you wait?

360
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:04,090
- Are you ok?
- Do I not look ok?

361
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:06,723
Actually, no.

362
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:11,799
If you're looking for service,
you have to go back

363
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:14,310
about four miles in the other direction.

364
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:19,814
Well, I'm actually just passing through
on my way to new English, officer,

365
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:22,268
or is it trooper?

366
00:32:22,983 --> 00:32:24,783
It's sheriff.

367
00:32:24,901 --> 00:32:28,491
This is not a town you "pass through".
It's barely a town that you live in.

368
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:31,373
What brings you
to this part of the world?

369
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:34,791
I'm a real-estate reporter.
Just doing a little house-hunting.

370
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,750
Well, here's some free reporting.

371
00:32:37,873 --> 00:32:41,503
Nothing's been built, bought,
or sold in new English in decades.

372
00:32:42,502 --> 00:32:45,132
All the houses are family-owned,
and passed down.

373
00:32:45,255 --> 00:32:49,585
And if it wouldn't be for that,
you'd be walking through a ghost town.

374
00:32:49,718 --> 00:32:52,718
My advice? Act as if you were.

375
00:33:02,731 --> 00:33:06,361
Miss Talben, if I seem inhospitable,
take it for hospitality.

376
00:33:06,485 --> 00:33:09,065
This is a small town.
They don't take much to strangers.

377
00:33:09,196 --> 00:33:10,856
Why's that?

378
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:14,197
They're strange.

379
00:33:42,229 --> 00:33:43,649
Excuse me?

380
00:34:51,423 --> 00:34:53,513
Hello?

381
00:34:54,718 --> 00:34:56,258
Excuse me?

382
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:10,897
We close in five minutes.

383
00:35:11,026 --> 00:35:13,276
Good day.

384
00:35:13,403 --> 00:35:16,573
I just need
archived birth and death records.

385
00:35:16,698 --> 00:35:19,868
You might actually know the person
I'm trying to find.

386
00:35:19,993 --> 00:35:21,493
Eulalia Howard?

387
00:35:22,621 --> 00:35:24,621
I don't know her.

388
00:35:24,748 --> 00:35:26,538
Never heard of her.

389
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:30,790
Ok.

390
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:36,421
How about local newspaper archives?
Town records?

391
00:35:37,427 --> 00:35:39,177
Local histories?

392
00:35:45,018 --> 00:35:48,348
Alright. Thank you for your help.
I'm just gonna show myself around.

393
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:52,360
Well, as long as you show yourself
out that door in four minutes.

394
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:08,330
That's my car!

395
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:12,669
Goddammit!

396
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:32,269
Ok, Howard...

397
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:03,776
Jesus! You scared me.

398
00:38:03,907 --> 00:38:05,697
I have that effect on people.

399
00:38:06,576 --> 00:38:08,406
Alicia.

400
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:10,956
Call me Allie, or I will grimace!

401
00:38:12,081 --> 00:38:14,331
- Julia.
- On.

402
00:38:14,459 --> 00:38:15,999
Julia.

403
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:18,883
I don't meet many strangers.

404
00:38:19,756 --> 00:38:21,416
Oh.

405
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:23,839
You are making me uncomfortable, Julia.

406
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:25,428
Oh.

407
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:27,513
I'm sorry. I was starting to think that

408
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:30,139
no one in new English
had any social graces.

409
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:33,596
This town soured
long before you were born, dear.

410
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:35,058
I could tell by the warm welcome.

411
00:38:35,188 --> 00:38:37,688
Frigid, right? Well, fuck 'em!

412
00:38:37,816 --> 00:38:42,316
Town this small, this old,
you can measure its age in secrets.

413
00:38:43,613 --> 00:38:46,033
Like the rings on a redwood.

414
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:48,777
What brings you to me?

415
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:51,410
Eulalia Howard.

416
00:38:51,538 --> 00:38:53,538
She was my mother.

417
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:56,455
Julia.

418
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:59,424
Hate to be the one brings you this news.

419
00:38:59,546 --> 00:39:03,256
But cancer took Eulalia
about 30 years back.

420
00:39:03,383 --> 00:39:06,093
I bought her property back in '85.

421
00:39:06,845 --> 00:39:09,005
You knew her?

422
00:39:09,138 --> 00:39:11,138
In passing.

423
00:39:11,266 --> 00:39:13,976
A town this small,
everybody knows everybody.

424
00:39:18,898 --> 00:39:23,358
Well, I think it's time you headed back
to where you come from.

425
00:39:24,529 --> 00:39:25,659
I'm Sony?

426
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:29,070
Best thing you could do
is put this town in your rear view.

427
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,410
Now go.

428
00:39:31,536 --> 00:39:33,656
I buried my sister
and her entire family last week.

429
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:36,998
So, I will leave your porch,
but I am not leaving new English.

430
00:39:39,127 --> 00:39:41,127
Oh, Julia.

431
00:39:44,549 --> 00:39:47,219
Your face, as pretty as it is,

432
00:39:47,343 --> 00:39:51,183
it might be the last new thing
that I ever see.

433
00:39:51,306 --> 00:39:55,476
So, a blanket and a bed,
that's the least I could do, right?

434
00:39:55,602 --> 00:39:57,272
Come on in.

435
00:39:57,395 --> 00:40:00,015
After you, milady.

436
00:40:01,983 --> 00:40:03,233
So...

437
00:40:04,277 --> 00:40:06,647
At one point,
this was a bed and breakfast.

438
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:10,239
That being said, you are my first guest.

439
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:13,487
All these vintage things.

440
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:15,580
It's like the inside of my head.

441
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:19,789
Remind me to clean this place.

442
00:40:25,173 --> 00:40:27,223
Oh, forget that.

443
00:40:27,342 --> 00:40:30,762
You'd do better out here with a tin can
and a really long piece of string.

444
00:40:30,887 --> 00:40:33,597
- So, no-go on cellular, huh?
- No-go, no-go, no-go.

445
00:40:33,723 --> 00:40:36,563
No cable, no gridlock, no fast food.

446
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:41,184
And no deal till you drink with
the town witch. Come to poison you.

447
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:47,185
- How do you like your Whisky?
- In a glass.

448
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:49,200
Perfect.

449
00:40:52,909 --> 00:40:54,239
Thank you.

450
00:40:54,369 --> 00:40:55,789
Cheers, Julia.

451
00:40:55,912 --> 00:40:57,252
Cheers.

452
00:40:58,373 --> 00:41:00,043
So are you from new English, Allie?

453
00:41:02,627 --> 00:41:03,707
Mmm.

454
00:41:05,964 --> 00:41:08,844
Born, raised, and surely will die.

455
00:41:12,053 --> 00:41:14,723
Are they doing construction
out on the forest?

456
00:41:14,847 --> 00:41:18,927
- Cut right to the chase.
- Help me fill in the blanks, please.

457
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:26,034
You should have seen this town
in its day.

458
00:41:27,443 --> 00:41:30,653
Now it's dying by decades.
Year by year.

459
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:35,280
It's shrinking like the skin
on my bones. I'm an old woman now.

460
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:37,408
Old face, old hair, old hands.

461
00:41:37,537 --> 00:41:41,167
Big veins, feet that feel like
they're a thousand years old.

462
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:44,000
Wasting away just like this town.

463
00:41:46,295 --> 00:41:48,505
Allie, who's Jebediah Crone?

464
00:41:53,386 --> 00:41:57,886
What's the point of having secrets...
If you got no one to share them with?

465
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:06,980
Terrible thing to die before your time.

466
00:42:07,108 --> 00:42:10,028
The only thing worse
is dying on your feet.

467
00:42:10,153 --> 00:42:12,163
That was us back then.

468
00:42:17,326 --> 00:42:19,076
But worst of all...

469
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:23,461
...is watching your children
die before you.

470
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:30,089
You remember how
the dust bowl preachers of the 1930s,

471
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:34,714
they came into the wasteland,
and they gave people god?

472
00:42:34,886 --> 00:42:38,256
The <i>grapes</i> of wrath. I read the book.

473
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:40,099
Well, Jebediah Crone...

474
00:42:42,185 --> 00:42:46,265
He came from the wasteland,
and he took god from us.

475
00:42:46,606 --> 00:42:48,936
For a moment of his glory, this.

476
00:42:49,067 --> 00:42:51,647
There's the public record
you can see at the library.

477
00:42:51,778 --> 00:42:53,908
And then there is my record.

478
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:57,324
There's things that I save.

479
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:02,366
Things that this town...
Might wish lost.

480
00:43:03,289 --> 00:43:06,669
Should have burned this. Surely
would destroy a lot of people's lives.

481
00:43:06,793 --> 00:43:08,173
Here.

482
00:43:13,883 --> 00:43:15,433
Allow me.

483
00:43:16,511 --> 00:43:18,301
I love old things.

484
00:43:19,305 --> 00:43:22,555
Then you're gonna love new English.

485
00:43:27,313 --> 00:43:30,653
When the town fell, we all fell with it.

486
00:43:30,775 --> 00:43:32,435
We got broke. We got sick.

487
00:43:32,568 --> 00:43:35,448
We blamed each other.
We blamed ourselves.

488
00:43:35,571 --> 00:43:38,321
Then came Crone with an answer.

489
00:43:40,952 --> 00:43:44,002
He said: "Blame god."

490
00:43:50,086 --> 00:43:53,376
<i>So much has been taken from you,
from this town.</i>

491
00:43:53,506 --> 00:43:56,586
<i>From god-fearing people.</i>

492
00:43:57,677 --> 00:44:01,847
To understand Jebediah Crone,
you can't hear just about the man.

493
00:44:01,973 --> 00:44:03,893
You have to hear the man himself.

494
00:44:04,016 --> 00:44:06,136
<i>False scripture you have in your hands.</i>

495
00:44:06,269 --> 00:44:08,979
<i>Make a testament
to what you hold most dear.</i>

496
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:12,400
<i>The loved ones,
your homes, your children!</i>

497
00:44:12,525 --> 00:44:14,525
Write it down. Put it on parchment.

498
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:16,702
Hold it high
for this counterfeit god to see!

499
00:44:16,821 --> 00:44:18,531
Hallelujah!

500
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:22,196
<i>Now, my children,
in this time of destitution...</i>

501
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:25,079
<i>...tainted by ruin...</i>

502
00:44:25,872 --> 00:44:29,462
<i>...we have struggled,
and been stolen from.</i>

503
00:44:29,584 --> 00:44:32,004
<i>Denied ourselves and been left empty.</i>

504
00:44:33,171 --> 00:44:36,631
<i>Send up a prayer, like a child's
balloon, like prideful Icarus,</i>

505
00:44:36,757 --> 00:44:38,547
<i>and watch it burn before heaven.</i>

506
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:42,296
<i>But bury it deep in rot, in filth,
and watch it take root in hell.</i>

507
00:44:42,430 --> 00:44:45,680
He'd opened our eyes,
and blinded us at the same time.

508
00:44:45,808 --> 00:44:50,228
Gave us control without morals.
Or mercy.

509
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:54,784
It's unspeakable, the things
a person will do not to feel powerless.

510
00:44:54,901 --> 00:44:58,491
So imagine what
a thousand might do together?

511
00:44:58,988 --> 00:45:01,658
<i>That sacrifice is required.</i>

512
00:45:01,782 --> 00:45:04,582
<i>This ailing boy, so undeserving,
can indeed be healed!</i>

513
00:45:04,702 --> 00:45:08,962
<i>As this town can be made whole again
by power and pleasure!</i>

514
00:45:09,081 --> 00:45:13,581
<i>By wealth and dominion!
But first, lambs must rise to lions!</i>

515
00:45:14,045 --> 00:45:17,255
<i>Beg miracles from murder!
For hell demands a sacrifice!</i>

516
00:45:18,174 --> 00:45:21,514
<i>You, boy! You with your camera!</i>

517
00:45:21,636 --> 00:45:25,966
<i>Filming, judging, offering nothing.
Stealing souls one frame at a time!</i>

518
00:45:26,098 --> 00:45:27,598
You wait here.

519
00:45:31,187 --> 00:45:33,187
<i>Oh, god, please! Christ, no!</i>

520
00:45:34,607 --> 00:45:37,687
- May I help you?
- Ls Julia here?

521
00:45:37,818 --> 00:45:40,648
Julia who?

522
00:45:40,821 --> 00:45:43,491
I know she's here.
Are we gonna play this game?

523
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:45,870
Grady.

524
00:45:47,995 --> 00:45:50,535
- A friend of yours?
- Yeah.

525
00:45:56,921 --> 00:45:58,711
Call me if you need me.

526
00:46:00,841 --> 00:46:02,721
Jesus Christ. What happened to you?

527
00:46:02,843 --> 00:46:05,393
I've been trying to call you
for six goddamn hours.

528
00:46:05,513 --> 00:46:07,773
You're a writer.
Write me a list of your friends.

529
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:10,350
Not your sources, or contacts,
but your friends.

530
00:46:10,476 --> 00:46:13,146
I bet you it's a really short one.
Am I even on it?

531
00:46:13,271 --> 00:46:14,441
You're the last one.

532
00:46:15,982 --> 00:46:18,572
- How did you find me?
- Welcome to the 21st century.

533
00:46:18,693 --> 00:46:21,453
- I'm a cop and you're an open book.
- I'd make an awful criminal.

534
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:24,320
Yeah. Well, you'd make
an even worse victim.

535
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:26,068
Listen to me.

536
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:30,250
No matter how many times you leave,
or how far you go,

537
00:46:30,371 --> 00:46:34,291
turn around and look behind you,
that shadow's gonna be me, ok?

538
00:46:35,751 --> 00:46:38,801
Now, can I come in,
or do I have to go scare up a warrant?

539
00:46:38,921 --> 00:46:41,761
Please, join us.

540
00:46:42,883 --> 00:46:45,093
- Mister...?
- Detective Declan Grady, ma'am.

541
00:46:45,219 --> 00:46:47,139
Cut out the "ma'am" shit.

542
00:46:47,805 --> 00:46:51,595
My name is Allie. And this is my house.

543
00:46:53,102 --> 00:46:54,982
Now, if you'd like to come in.

544
00:46:56,897 --> 00:46:58,977
This way.

545
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:03,400
Hey, this dance we're doing
has a pretty short song.

546
00:47:03,529 --> 00:47:05,569
Comes a time, we don't move forward,

547
00:47:05,698 --> 00:47:08,868
we're just gonna be two people
standing in the dark, ok?

548
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:14,623
I need you to show you something.

549
00:47:17,710 --> 00:47:19,710
<i>Get off me! Christ, no!</i>

550
00:47:22,590 --> 00:47:24,590
<i>God doesn't come.
Your savior doesn't save!</i>

551
00:47:24,717 --> 00:47:26,637
<i>You're in his house,
and yet he turns his back.</i>

552
00:47:26,761 --> 00:47:28,801
<i>You call his name
and he does not answer.</i>

553
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:31,679
<i>Darkness, Grant life from life,
blood from blood</i>

554
00:47:31,807 --> 00:47:35,767
<i>that this useless flesh might yield
useful hands and do your work.</i>

555
00:47:35,895 --> 00:47:38,555
<i>- Will you fall with me, children?
- Yes!</i>

556
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:41,109
<i>Will you rip from this boy
as you would from the world?</i>

557
00:47:41,233 --> 00:47:43,443
<i>- Yes!
- So be it!</i>

558
00:47:53,079 --> 00:47:55,119
Ah, Jesus!

559
00:47:55,247 --> 00:47:59,287
Was nowhere to be found that day.
Or any day that followed.

560
00:47:59,418 --> 00:48:01,878
Jebediah Crone had been to hell.

561
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,920
And he brought back with him...

562
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:08,090
...some of his secrets.

563
00:48:09,303 --> 00:48:12,603
<i>Stand, son.
Receive the blessing due you.</i>

564
00:48:20,356 --> 00:48:24,776
Sacrificing that man
gave a cripple the ability to walk.

565
00:48:25,486 --> 00:48:29,986
And it was through sacrifice
that we would rebuild new English.

566
00:48:30,491 --> 00:48:33,701
<i>Let this be a testament
to the power of self.</i>

567
00:48:33,828 --> 00:48:36,158
<i>Now that you have seen this power,
know this:</i>

568
00:48:36,288 --> 00:48:40,328
<i>If heaven is a house of many rooms,
we shall build a hell of many more.</i>

569
00:48:41,419 --> 00:48:45,009
<i>To restore new English,
we shall build a great monument.</i>

570
00:48:46,048 --> 00:48:48,838
<i>Tall and terrible and absolute.</i>

571
00:48:48,968 --> 00:48:53,058
<i>That would make god writhe in awe,
and Satan weep with envy.</i>

572
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:57,560
<i>That will memorialize ourselves
in life and death.</i>

573
00:48:57,685 --> 00:49:02,145
<i>Are you willing to build this
foundation on the bones of angels?</i>

574
00:49:03,774 --> 00:49:06,404
<i>Anoint yourself. Deliver yourself.</i>

575
00:49:08,654 --> 00:49:10,324
What the hell is this?

576
00:49:12,283 --> 00:49:16,783
It's the miracle that Jebediah Crone
provided to new English.

577
00:49:18,497 --> 00:49:22,917
Better living through sin and sacrifice.

578
00:49:23,043 --> 00:49:26,463
- The town killed the man.
- And many more after that.

579
00:49:26,589 --> 00:49:28,589
The town made a pact with Crone.

580
00:49:28,716 --> 00:49:32,676
We all did, but we pledged more
than we had the power to give.

581
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:37,303
Oh, Julia. I've seen and done
far worse things than you.

582
00:49:37,683 --> 00:49:39,893
But I have lived past giving a shit.

583
00:49:41,854 --> 00:49:44,314
But this town has not.

584
00:49:46,692 --> 00:49:48,822
It's fearful.

585
00:49:50,905 --> 00:49:54,905
And there's nothing more dangerous
than something that's afraid.

586
00:50:48,671 --> 00:50:50,171
Hey.

587
00:50:50,297 --> 00:50:52,507
Put this on. You must be freezing.

588
00:50:55,761 --> 00:50:57,891
Do you believe me now?

589
00:50:59,014 --> 00:51:01,024
I always believed you.

590
00:51:02,351 --> 00:51:05,401
- Thought you didn't have service.
- I don't.

591
00:51:08,566 --> 00:51:12,316
- Just press play.
- Jules, I've already seen this video.

592
00:51:12,444 --> 00:51:14,114
I'm still trying to forget it.

593
00:51:14,238 --> 00:51:16,318
Please, watch it again.

594
00:51:16,448 --> 00:51:19,408
What am I looking for here?

595
00:51:19,535 --> 00:51:22,155
The walls were already bloody
before the attack.

596
00:52:10,878 --> 00:52:15,218
The room, it doesn't look right.
It doesn't look the same.

597
00:52:15,341 --> 00:52:18,261
It's like it's... staged.

598
00:52:19,303 --> 00:52:21,893
Alright, look. I did make some calls.

599
00:52:22,014 --> 00:52:24,774
Pulled some favors
and wound up with this.

600
00:52:30,856 --> 00:52:34,526
"Dorothy and Cecelia Crone were laid
to rest in Brookline cemetery today.

601
00:52:34,652 --> 00:52:36,902
Survived by reverend Jebediah Crone,

602
00:52:37,029 --> 00:52:39,909
still in a critical condition
at mercy falls hospital."

603
00:52:40,032 --> 00:52:44,042
- How did I miss this?
- Now get this fascinating little extra.

604
00:52:44,161 --> 00:52:45,831
Crone died twice.

605
00:52:45,954 --> 00:52:48,754
Flat-lined from a gunshot before
his ticker starting beating again.

606
00:52:48,874 --> 00:52:51,334
What the fuck is that?

607
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:53,550
Jesus Christ!

608
00:52:54,630 --> 00:52:58,550
Anyway, somebody didn't like
the snake oil the old man was selling,

609
00:52:58,676 --> 00:53:01,386
and he capped the whole fucking family
in front of him.

610
00:53:03,639 --> 00:53:05,599
What?

611
00:53:05,724 --> 00:53:07,814
That's what Allie said.

612
00:53:09,144 --> 00:53:11,904
"He went to hell,
and he brought back its secrets."

613
00:53:13,982 --> 00:53:15,902
You gotta be kidding me.

614
00:54:25,429 --> 00:54:26,759
Grady?

615
00:54:47,493 --> 00:54:49,753
Shall we finish what we started?

616
00:54:53,665 --> 00:54:55,285
Allie?

617
00:55:02,257 --> 00:55:06,427
- Grady?
- Shh. You stay here.

618
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:21,070
Allie? Allie?

619
00:55:24,738 --> 00:55:27,988
Allie? Shit!

620
00:55:29,576 --> 00:55:31,486
She stole my fucking car!

621
00:55:35,499 --> 00:55:36,749
Shit.

622
00:55:40,212 --> 00:55:41,592
Hey, you!

623
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:47,260
Don't move! Oh, god! Shit!

624
00:55:51,056 --> 00:55:52,966
Get back in the house. Go! Now!

625
00:56:03,318 --> 00:56:04,648
Grady?

626
00:56:26,758 --> 00:56:29,178
We have to get out of here.
Get away, get home, now.

627
00:56:29,303 --> 00:56:32,513
I can rain my own hellfire
on this place. SWAT, feds, whatever.

628
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:37,059
I can swing a big fucking hammer,
but not with you still here. Let's go.

629
00:56:45,444 --> 00:56:47,454
Who doesn't have a goddamn phone?

630
00:56:47,571 --> 00:56:49,991
Somebody that doesn't wanna be found.

631
00:56:50,115 --> 00:56:52,945
What's wrong? What?

632
00:56:55,203 --> 00:56:57,293
You know this person?

633
00:56:59,458 --> 00:57:01,208
Look at that woman.

634
00:57:03,587 --> 00:57:06,967
- Is this Allie?
- And Amanda, and me.

635
00:57:09,593 --> 00:57:12,353
She lied to me. She's my mother.

636
00:57:15,223 --> 00:57:18,813
Ok, look, we gotta go now.
Alright? Let's go. Come on.

637
00:57:20,145 --> 00:57:21,765
Jules...

638
00:57:23,815 --> 00:57:28,315
What kind of paper stops publishing in
1981, and then starts back up in 1987?

639
00:57:29,154 --> 00:57:31,704
No clue.
Can we talk about it on the way out?

640
00:57:32,908 --> 00:57:36,618
The school fire. It happened
two weeks after Crone showed up.

641
00:57:36,745 --> 00:57:38,405
February 11th, 1981.

642
00:57:38,538 --> 00:57:41,368
All of the kids died,
and there were no survivors.

643
00:57:42,417 --> 00:57:44,747
He collects tragedies.

644
00:57:44,878 --> 00:57:47,758
This entire town is a tragedy.

645
00:57:47,881 --> 00:57:50,631
Renshaw said Crone
was collecting cracks.

646
00:57:50,759 --> 00:57:53,929
"Put enough cracks together,
and they turn acidic."

647
00:57:54,054 --> 00:57:55,564
Fucking Renshaw.

648
00:57:55,681 --> 00:57:58,771
He said knock a hole in the prison wall,
and walk out with the prisoners.

649
00:57:58,892 --> 00:58:02,692
- How old was Amanda in '81?
- I don't know. Seven? Why?

650
00:58:02,813 --> 00:58:06,073
Old enough to attend that school, right?
If you match the dates.

651
00:58:08,819 --> 00:58:11,069
Amanda should have died in that fire.

652
00:58:13,198 --> 00:58:15,738
Alright, listen to me.
The town's three miles away.

653
00:58:15,867 --> 00:58:18,787
We're getting out, and I'm calling it
in. Let's go. Come on.

654
00:58:18,912 --> 00:58:22,542
I think my dad was onto something.
He tried running. Got us both out.

655
00:58:22,666 --> 00:58:25,086
- Out of new English?
- Yes, out of this town.

656
00:58:25,210 --> 00:58:28,090
No, dear. He was running from me.

657
00:58:29,047 --> 00:58:30,167
Fuck!

658
00:58:37,639 --> 00:58:40,349
Allow me to introduce myself.

659
00:58:40,475 --> 00:58:44,475
My name is Jebediah Crone,
and this is my card.

660
00:58:44,604 --> 00:58:48,364
One inch forward, six feet down.
You understand, old man?

661
00:58:48,483 --> 00:58:51,153
Oh, I've been there before.

662
00:58:51,695 --> 00:58:54,655
Minor inconvenience, death.

663
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:57,740
Make no mistake,
I will shoot you in the fucking head,

664
00:58:57,868 --> 00:59:00,368
and sleep like a baby tonight.

665
00:59:01,455 --> 00:59:03,745
I enjoy your writing, miss Talben.

666
00:59:03,874 --> 00:59:08,174
Especially the lovely tale
about the mother of the afflicted child

667
00:59:08,295 --> 00:59:10,955
searching for her birth parents.

668
00:59:11,089 --> 00:59:12,969
Made my heart weep.

669
00:59:13,091 --> 00:59:15,761
You collect words
the way I collect rooms,

670
00:59:15,886 --> 00:59:18,046
and the damned that wander them.

671
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:19,810
We are, both of us...

672
00:59:21,558 --> 00:59:24,348
...clear in our pursuits.

673
00:59:24,478 --> 00:59:28,358
We both want a reunion
with those close to our hearts.

674
00:59:28,482 --> 00:59:31,902
L just have to go further to get mine.

675
00:59:32,027 --> 00:59:36,527
Tell me, dear, have you found
what you're looking for yet?

676
00:59:36,782 --> 00:59:40,122
- I'm excited to know.
- You took them from me!

677
00:59:42,496 --> 00:59:45,786
I took nothing from you, miss Talben.

678
00:59:47,084 --> 00:59:49,344
Just purchased a piece of real estate.

679
00:59:49,461 --> 00:59:51,841
No crime in that.

680
00:59:51,963 --> 00:59:54,473
Don't you move.

681
00:59:59,471 --> 01:00:02,101
Amanda's death itself, a tragedy.

682
01:00:02,224 --> 01:00:04,434
True. Tragic.

683
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:08,599
But a promise fulfilled.
A debt collected.

684
01:00:08,730 --> 01:00:10,690
Don't you dare say her name.

685
01:00:11,525 --> 01:00:16,025
Ah, family is truly the only real
heaven you'll ever know.

686
01:00:18,949 --> 01:00:21,579
I'm gonna find out
what you're doing, I promise,

687
01:00:21,701 --> 01:00:24,041
and I'm gonna burn it
to the fucking ground.

688
01:00:24,913 --> 01:00:29,413
Oh, I know a few things about fire,
miss Talben.

689
01:00:30,043 --> 01:00:32,053
Spent time in the flames.

690
01:00:32,170 --> 01:00:36,670
Watched as they flickered
and danced and consumed things.

691
01:00:38,844 --> 01:00:42,934
Fire has a way of... motivating you.

692
01:00:44,099 --> 01:00:47,059
What kind of hold do you have
on these people and this town?

693
01:00:47,853 --> 01:00:52,353
I'm sure you've heard the old saying:
"Tragedy brings folks together".

694
01:00:53,358 --> 01:00:56,438
I can assure you the verity
of that statement.

695
01:00:57,237 --> 01:01:00,567
It was the tragedy that bound this town.

696
01:01:02,242 --> 01:01:06,622
It is one last tragedy
that will set them free.

697
01:01:07,789 --> 01:01:11,749
If it brings you any comfort,
miss Talben,

698
01:01:11,877 --> 01:01:15,297
know that Amanda and Charlie live on,
and Felix, too.

699
01:01:18,300 --> 01:01:21,930
- But you've seen the video.
- What the fuck did you just say?!

700
01:01:25,223 --> 01:01:27,353
Weapon on the deck! Now!

701
01:01:27,475 --> 01:01:29,765
Hands high, fingers spread,
so I can see 'em.

702
01:01:29,895 --> 01:01:34,355
- Do it, slick!
- I'm a cop, goddamn it!

703
01:01:34,524 --> 01:01:38,154
What'd you do? Call in reinforcements?
I thought I asked you to leave.

704
01:01:38,278 --> 01:01:41,698
Sheriff, you're harboring a criminal
who's just run off into the woods.

705
01:01:41,823 --> 01:01:45,373
The woods around these parts
tend to take more than they give.

706
01:01:45,493 --> 01:01:47,373
What do you two hope to accomplish?

707
01:01:47,495 --> 01:01:50,205
Aren't you the goddamn law in this town?
Huh?

708
01:01:50,332 --> 01:01:53,592
They're constructing something
in the forest.

709
01:01:54,586 --> 01:01:57,256
But you already know that, don't you?

710
01:01:57,380 --> 01:02:01,220
This town and its wellbeing
is my concern, not yours.

711
01:02:03,053 --> 01:02:04,643
And that out there...

712
01:02:06,181 --> 01:02:09,181
...that's the past unburying itself.

713
01:02:09,309 --> 01:02:13,099
And you do not lend it a shovel.
Do you read me?

714
01:02:13,230 --> 01:02:15,690
- Do you read me?
- Yeah, I read you.

715
01:02:24,407 --> 01:02:25,777
Alright.

716
01:02:27,035 --> 01:02:30,535
Eddie'll be here in about 45 minutes
to unhook you.

717
01:02:32,123 --> 01:02:36,133
Get your car. Be on your way.
Get out of town.

718
01:02:36,253 --> 01:02:39,013
Not later, not in a few hours. Now.

719
01:02:39,130 --> 01:02:42,170
I promise you, if I see you again
you'll be wearing handcuffs.

720
01:02:42,342 --> 01:02:45,762
Has anyone ever found this thing?
Whatever the fuck it is he's building?

721
01:02:45,887 --> 01:02:48,007
Do you think
you're the first one to look?

722
01:02:48,139 --> 01:02:51,139
First one to hear a rumor,
stretch a tall tale?

723
01:02:51,851 --> 01:02:55,601
Some folks come out,
their eyes all glassed over.

724
01:02:55,730 --> 01:02:58,440
Some folks come out
and put a bullet in their mouth.

725
01:02:59,776 --> 01:03:02,146
Most just come out
with a bad case of poison sumac,

726
01:03:02,279 --> 01:03:03,949
and they itch like the very devil.

727
01:03:05,115 --> 01:03:08,695
I'll keep an eye out for your car,
detective, but don't hold your breath.

728
01:03:09,244 --> 01:03:12,914
Follow the highway home.
Live a full life.

729
01:03:14,833 --> 01:03:17,253
Don't come back to new English.

730
01:03:18,169 --> 01:03:20,049
Thanks for the tip.

731
01:03:21,256 --> 01:03:23,166
Jerk-off.

732
01:03:37,105 --> 01:03:39,145
They're hiding something.

733
01:03:39,274 --> 01:03:40,944
This entire town.

734
01:03:45,739 --> 01:03:50,239
You know what? It's time we found out
what Jebediah Crone is building.

735
01:04:12,057 --> 01:04:15,017
I don't know if it's the fact
I don't know the difference

736
01:04:15,143 --> 01:04:18,483
between an oak or an elm,
or a Rockefeller center Christmas tree,

737
01:04:18,605 --> 01:04:22,185
or that we walked into the forest
version of the Bermuda triangle.

738
01:04:22,984 --> 01:04:25,244
Ok. Stop.

739
01:04:40,043 --> 01:04:41,923
What is this?

740
01:05:02,607 --> 01:05:04,477
"I pledge my son, Charles Eaton."

741
01:05:04,609 --> 01:05:07,399
"I pledge penny Marie Goodwin,
my daughter."

742
01:05:07,529 --> 01:05:09,859
"I pledge my daughter, Lexi,
and my son, Jeremy."

743
01:05:12,367 --> 01:05:15,157
"I pledge Lance Luther, my son."

744
01:05:20,834 --> 01:05:22,964
Grady, the school fire.

745
01:05:23,086 --> 01:05:27,256
Crone talked of sacrifice in that
sermon. This town pledged their kids.

746
01:05:29,175 --> 01:05:31,545
- This is awful.
- Jules, Jules...

747
01:05:33,430 --> 01:05:35,350
"I pledge Amanda Howard, my daughter."

748
01:05:38,101 --> 01:05:40,351
No. No!

749
01:05:40,478 --> 01:05:42,648
Jules, what can I do?

750
01:06:25,732 --> 01:06:28,112
What is this?

751
01:06:28,234 --> 01:06:30,364
His collection.

752
01:06:43,041 --> 01:06:45,211
Grady, look at this.

753
01:06:56,346 --> 01:06:58,176
Look at all these rooms.

754
01:07:06,773 --> 01:07:08,613
Look at this.

755
01:07:53,486 --> 01:07:56,236
- Julia...
- Her room is out here somewhere.

756
01:07:58,700 --> 01:07:59,740
Argh!

757
01:07:59,867 --> 01:08:04,077
- Grady, behind you!
- Drop the weapon! Drop it!

758
01:08:04,205 --> 01:08:05,785
The trigger...

759
01:08:05,915 --> 01:08:07,915
Go! Go!

760
01:08:08,042 --> 01:08:09,962
What is this? No!

761
01:08:10,795 --> 01:08:13,755
- Grady!
- That! That! What the fuck was that?

762
01:08:13,881 --> 01:08:15,421
Let's go! Let's go!

763
01:08:27,437 --> 01:08:29,857
Where's your boyfriend?

764
01:08:31,649 --> 01:08:34,069
- Where is he?!
- Right behind you, asshole.

765
01:08:36,946 --> 01:08:38,236
' - Grady!

766
01:08:43,703 --> 01:08:45,793
Grady!

767
01:08:53,212 --> 01:08:55,762
Tell me what the fuck is going on
in new English.

768
01:08:55,882 --> 01:08:58,682
- If I tell you, he kills me.
- If you don't, I will.

769
01:08:58,885 --> 01:09:01,505
Fuck!

770
01:09:01,679 --> 01:09:05,219
- Hey. Here. Put these on for me.
- You fucking kidding me?!

771
01:09:05,350 --> 01:09:07,770
Shut up! Put 'em on!
Put 'em on right now!

772
01:09:07,894 --> 01:09:09,734
- Julia, get in the car.
- What?

773
01:09:09,854 --> 01:09:11,814
Get in the car! Put 'em on!

774
01:09:18,738 --> 01:09:21,568
So tell me,
what the fuck is going on here?

775
01:09:21,699 --> 01:09:23,579
And I don't believe in ghosts.

776
01:09:23,701 --> 01:09:26,331
I gave you every opportunity to leave,

777
01:09:26,454 --> 01:09:28,794
and you had to kick over
the goddamn hornet's nest.

778
01:09:28,915 --> 01:09:32,075
- Fuck you. Book us.
- Afraid that option's off the table.

779
01:09:33,378 --> 01:09:36,128
Just do what he says, ok?
Just do what he says.

780
01:09:36,255 --> 01:09:38,545
Get out. Out.

781
01:09:40,802 --> 01:09:43,512
- Get the fuck off me!
- No, no, no, no!

782
01:09:43,638 --> 01:09:48,138
I stayed away from those woods half of
my goddamn life like a frickin' plague.

783
01:09:49,769 --> 01:09:52,769
Kids burning alive in a school building.
Tell me what happens next.

784
01:09:52,897 --> 01:09:57,147
What happens next? You have no idea
what this town was promised,

785
01:09:57,276 --> 01:09:58,686
or why we did what we did.

786
01:09:58,820 --> 01:10:00,910
I came all the way out here to die.
Just talk!

787
01:10:01,030 --> 01:10:04,990
- Get down on your knees.
- It wasn't an electrical fire, was it?

788
01:10:05,118 --> 01:10:08,248
You sacrificed your kids to him?
And for what?

789
01:10:08,371 --> 01:10:11,291
The miracle of new English?
Show me the miracle of new English.

790
01:10:11,416 --> 01:10:14,126
Show me the miracle of Jebediah Crone,
you stupid man.

791
01:10:16,629 --> 01:10:18,629
The ground needed to be consecrated.

792
01:10:19,507 --> 01:10:21,797
The foundations need to be laid.

793
01:10:22,885 --> 01:10:26,305
It started with a tragedy,
and it's gonna end with one. You...

794
01:10:26,431 --> 01:10:28,471
- No, no...
- You and your sister are leaving.

795
01:10:28,599 --> 01:10:32,769
It symbolized the one thing
that he was trying to remove: Hope.

796
01:10:32,895 --> 01:10:34,515
Please don't do this! Please!

797
01:10:34,647 --> 01:10:37,857
No, I'm gonna spare you both
from a very unfortunate life there.

798
01:10:38,901 --> 01:10:40,991
' <i>'</i> No!

799
01:10:41,112 --> 01:10:43,702
No, no, really.
I'm doing you a great kindness here.

800
01:10:43,823 --> 01:10:47,703
I don't expect you to understand,
but this is probably the last good deed

801
01:10:47,827 --> 01:10:50,247
I'm gonna do with my wretched life.
Believe me,

802
01:10:50,371 --> 01:10:54,871
the alternative they got planned for you
out in the forest is much, much worse.

803
01:10:56,085 --> 01:11:00,255
Julia Howard, this town
has awaited your return

804
01:11:00,381 --> 01:11:02,721
like lambs to the slaughter.

805
01:11:03,426 --> 01:11:06,006
The two that got away.

806
01:11:06,137 --> 01:11:08,307
The only blood in new English
that survived.

807
01:11:08,431 --> 01:11:12,771
Well, I'm gonna give you an out
that I couldn't give your sister.

808
01:11:12,894 --> 01:11:15,904
You just consider this bullet
to be the savior

809
01:11:16,022 --> 01:11:18,862
of what's waiting for you out there
in that forest.

810
01:11:20,943 --> 01:11:23,953
Because you can't build
a room out of water.

811
01:11:26,073 --> 01:11:29,243
- I wish you a peaceful, always forward.
- No.

812
01:11:39,587 --> 01:11:41,207
- No!
- Julia!

813
01:11:41,339 --> 01:11:43,049
Grady! No!

814
01:11:50,556 --> 01:11:52,426
This way...

815
01:12:23,756 --> 01:12:25,416
Grady?

816
01:12:33,015 --> 01:12:35,095
This way...

817
01:14:23,918 --> 01:14:26,088
Welcome, my dear.

818
01:14:29,215 --> 01:14:31,875
Please, allow me to offer you a deal.

819
01:14:32,009 --> 01:14:34,719
A compact, let's say.

820
01:14:34,845 --> 01:14:36,715
One time only.

821
01:14:36,847 --> 01:14:41,307
You can walk away.
Tell your story to the whole world.

822
01:14:41,435 --> 01:14:45,685
Oh, what a captivating story
it would be. What a scoop.

823
01:14:46,482 --> 01:14:50,282
Plucky writer exposes
some supernatural malefactor

824
01:14:50,403 --> 01:14:53,073
who makes a collection of ghosts,

825
01:14:53,197 --> 01:14:57,697
who opens a portal
to some fearful netherworld

826
01:14:58,619 --> 01:15:02,619
that exploits the denizens of a town

827
01:15:02,748 --> 01:15:06,038
that sacrifices their children.

828
01:15:06,168 --> 01:15:09,378
Front pager, for sure, but...

829
01:15:10,631 --> 01:15:13,051
...one without an ending.

830
01:15:13,551 --> 01:15:18,051
Or you may enter my house
upon your own free will.

831
01:15:19,849 --> 01:15:24,189
See your loved ones once again.
Be united.

832
01:15:24,770 --> 01:15:28,190
But that choice is entirely up to you.

833
01:15:28,315 --> 01:15:31,605
- The video of Amanda?
- Taken in this very house.

834
01:15:31,736 --> 01:15:34,356
They await you inside.

835
01:15:35,364 --> 01:15:38,284
- What did you do with Grady?
- He's alive.

836
01:15:38,409 --> 01:15:40,869
But that is neither here nor there.

837
01:15:41,495 --> 01:15:43,455
Decide, please.

838
01:15:44,957 --> 01:15:48,207
Forward... or reverse?

839
01:15:49,295 --> 01:15:51,955
Your sister awaits a reunion.

840
01:15:56,343 --> 01:15:59,473
As they say in the south: "Come on in."

841
01:16:06,145 --> 01:16:07,725
Forgive the disorder.

842
01:16:10,066 --> 01:16:11,976
They're unaccustomed to guests.

843
01:16:21,827 --> 01:16:26,327
Daddy dearest... did everything he could
to save his daughters.

844
01:16:26,791 --> 01:16:29,591
Only to have them to return to me.

845
01:16:29,710 --> 01:16:33,300
There was a time I thought
you burned with the rest.

846
01:16:33,422 --> 01:16:34,842
Clever that one.

847
01:16:34,965 --> 01:16:38,425
Years I spent wondering
where I went wrong.

848
01:16:38,552 --> 01:16:41,142
Never realizing the two that escaped.

849
01:16:41,263 --> 01:16:42,853
What do you want?

850
01:16:44,767 --> 01:16:47,137
Merely for you to listen.

851
01:16:47,269 --> 01:16:49,689
I'm a man of words after all.
Tongue tipped in silver.

852
01:16:51,107 --> 01:16:53,937
And I do not enjoy being misunderstood.

853
01:16:54,068 --> 01:16:56,528
When we first spoke,
I told you about the fire.

854
01:16:56,654 --> 01:16:58,914
I gather you figured out
how I got there.

855
01:16:59,740 --> 01:17:04,240
You killed innocent children,
and you corrupt an entire town. Why?

856
01:17:05,704 --> 01:17:08,964
I was a swindler swindled, miss Talben.

857
01:17:09,083 --> 01:17:11,633
That's a quote. You can quote me.

858
01:17:11,752 --> 01:17:16,252
One curries no favor with the devil.
It all truly is just flames.

859
01:17:16,674 --> 01:17:19,134
Divine irony.

860
01:17:19,260 --> 01:17:23,180
But like Christ,
the great deceiver, I ascended.

861
01:17:25,057 --> 01:17:28,637
You live amongst the shadows
of the past

862
01:17:28,769 --> 01:17:33,269
with your typewriter
and snappy repartee.

863
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:35,360
You carry your dearly departed around

864
01:17:35,484 --> 01:17:39,864
like... atlas bore the weight
of the world.

865
01:17:40,656 --> 01:17:44,986
I have seen what awaits on the other
side, and I have become proactive.

866
01:17:45,119 --> 01:17:49,539
You have hopes and dreams.

867
01:17:50,082 --> 01:17:52,752
Turn around. Walk away.

868
01:17:54,795 --> 01:17:56,665
Bother us no more.

869
01:17:58,382 --> 01:18:01,512
You killed my family. You poisoned them.

870
01:18:03,512 --> 01:18:06,602
Where did you put him? Where is he?!

871
01:18:08,350 --> 01:18:11,480
Would you like to see
my collection?

872
01:18:11,604 --> 01:18:15,654
Death and re-death
for the rest of all eternity.

873
01:19:18,587 --> 01:19:20,087
Why?

874
01:19:21,090 --> 01:19:23,300
I'm just connecting the dots.

875
01:19:23,425 --> 01:19:27,795
To combine these tragedies,
and create a discordancy.

876
01:19:27,930 --> 01:19:29,930
A crack within cracks.

877
01:19:30,057 --> 01:19:34,387
I'm a collector, miss Talben,
and this house is my collection.

878
01:19:35,729 --> 01:19:39,149
Small pieces combined
to form a greater whole.

879
01:19:40,192 --> 01:19:43,992
Each death collected,
one step closer to breaking the wall

880
01:19:44,113 --> 01:19:47,413
between this world and after.

881
01:19:49,243 --> 01:19:51,083
Goodbye, miss Talben.

882
01:19:51,912 --> 01:19:53,512
I hope you find what you're looking for.

883
01:20:14,727 --> 01:20:17,147

Amanda? Charlie?

889
01:21:10,783 --> 01:21:12,703
<i>Please help us!</i>

890
01:21:25,255 --> 01:21:27,165

Julia!

898
01:22:36,410 --> 01:22:37,870
Where the fuck is she?

899
01:22:37,995 --> 01:22:41,825
Before you enter,
of your own free will, dare I say,

900
01:22:41,957 --> 01:22:45,787
let me offer you a comeback, a bargain.

901
01:22:45,919 --> 01:22:47,919
- No strings.
- What?

902
01:22:48,046 --> 01:22:49,916
You may walk away, right now,

903
01:22:50,048 --> 01:22:53,968
as you have suggested yourself,
so many times before.

904
01:22:54,094 --> 01:22:57,894
Live your life fully and freely.

905
01:22:58,015 --> 01:23:01,385
Or you can continue to follow the woman
who has brought you nothing...

906
01:23:01,518 --> 01:23:04,308
- Shut the fuck up.
- ...But grief.

907
01:23:04,438 --> 01:23:06,898
Hasn't she brought you
enough pain already?

908
01:23:08,025 --> 01:23:12,525
It would be a tragedy
to go one step further, detective.

909
01:23:12,654 --> 01:23:15,074
Learn from your past mistakes.

910
01:23:16,200 --> 01:23:17,830
The future is that way, son.

911
01:23:19,161 --> 01:23:21,871
There's nothing in this house,
but the past.

912
01:23:56,198 --> 01:23:57,818
Oh, my god.

913
01:24:16,510 --> 01:24:18,300
Hey! Hey, you!

914
01:24:34,987 --> 01:24:36,987
Oh, my god!

915
01:24:38,031 --> 01:24:39,121
Help!

916
01:24:40,742 --> 01:24:43,292
No! No!

917
01:24:43,412 --> 01:24:45,412
No! No; “q!

918
01:24:45,539 --> 01:24:47,459
No, no, no, no! No!

919
01:24:49,626 --> 01:24:51,706
No!

920
01:25:03,599 --> 01:25:05,349
No!

921
01:25:17,988 --> 01:25:20,658
Grady!

922
01:25:48,769 --> 01:25:50,269
Fuck!

923
01:25:57,986 --> 01:26:00,406
Julia!

924
01:26:50,664 --> 01:26:54,634
<i>Mommy! Help me, mommy! Help me!</i>

925
01:26:57,087 --> 01:26:59,667
<i>Mommy, help me! Help me!</i>

926
01:27:07,180 --> 01:27:11,230

928
01:27:20,402 --> 01:27:24,412
Charlie? Charlie?

929
01:27:28,994 --> 01:27:31,964
Charlie? I'm here, Charlie.

930
01:27:39,838 --> 01:27:42,048
<i>This way...</i>

931
01:27:44,009 --> 01:27:48,259
- <i>Help!

932
01:27:53,393 --> 01:27:56,693
No, no.

933
01:28:07,616 --> 01:28:09,366

No!

939
01:28:38,688 --> 01:28:40,268
No...

01:29:11,888 --> 01:29:14,598
Julia!

942
01:29:17,352 --> 01:29:19,062
Julia!

943
01:29:21,439 --> 01:29:23,569
Julia, we've gotta go! Come on!

944
01:29:24,860 --> 01:29:26,490
Julia!

945
01:29:27,946 --> 01:29:30,696
Julia! Julia!

946
01:29:31,616 --> 01:29:33,326
Julia!

947
01:29:36,246 --> 01:29:37,616
Grady, no!

948
01:29:40,500 --> 01:29:44,710
Grady! What do I do?

949
01:29:45,171 --> 01:29:47,921
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

950
01:29:54,139 --> 01:29:57,269
No, this isn't happening.

951
01:30:00,020 --> 01:30:01,810
Touching, really.

952
01:30:02,480 --> 01:30:04,690
Poor miss Julia Talben.

953
01:30:04,816 --> 01:30:08,396
One so easily played.

954
01:30:09,195 --> 01:30:12,905
Julia Talben,
all ambition with nothing to lose,

955
01:30:13,033 --> 01:30:16,833
perfectly inclined
to be my willing guest.

956
01:30:16,953 --> 01:30:21,453
This house of a thousand tragedies
required only a single tragedy

957
01:30:21,750 --> 01:30:23,880
all its own to become complete.

958
01:30:24,002 --> 01:30:26,052
- Julia Talben...
- Grady.

959
01:30:26,171 --> 01:30:27,511
...murderess.

960
01:30:27,631 --> 01:30:30,221
Killed the man she loved.

961
01:30:30,342 --> 01:30:32,592
The only one in this world

962
01:30:32,719 --> 01:30:37,219
capable of loving her in return
just for who she is.

963
01:30:37,891 --> 01:30:42,391
I gave him every chance to walk away,
as I did you.

964
01:30:44,856 --> 01:30:47,436
L would never turn my back on my family.

965
01:30:48,026 --> 01:30:49,856
Nor me, mine.

966
01:30:58,620 --> 01:31:00,750
You did all of this for them.

967
01:31:00,872 --> 01:31:02,832
They were the first.

968
01:31:03,416 --> 01:31:05,536
The anchor to my abattoir.

969
01:31:07,837 --> 01:31:09,837
Your wife and daughter?

970
01:31:10,340 --> 01:31:12,380
Still in the flames.

971
01:31:14,386 --> 01:31:17,346
Paid the price for my sins.

972
01:31:17,472 --> 01:31:20,852
Burned because of my indiscretions.

973
01:31:21,601 --> 01:31:26,101
Sentenced to an eternity of suffering,
forever and ever indeed.

974
01:31:28,149 --> 01:31:32,649
You see, you and I are not so different,
miss Talben.

975
01:31:33,571 --> 01:31:37,031
You would brave a hell
for your loved ones.

976
01:31:37,158 --> 01:31:40,328
I would construct one for mine.

977
01:31:41,579 --> 01:31:44,619
And you are my final tragedy.

978
01:31:44,749 --> 01:31:47,209
The capstone to my foundation.

979
01:31:47,335 --> 01:31:49,795
Your sacrifice is what unlocks it all.

980
01:31:49,921 --> 01:31:53,261
You were pledged at birth,
and belong to this house.

981
01:31:53,383 --> 01:31:57,353
The final drop of blood
born from new English.

982
01:31:58,054 --> 01:32:01,604
My final stray come home at last.

983
01:32:05,311 --> 01:32:08,481
What did he have to do with your plan?
Why him?

984
01:32:08,606 --> 01:32:11,396
His blood is on your hands.

985
01:32:11,526 --> 01:32:16,026
The only family you have
is now at home with me.

986
01:32:16,239 --> 01:32:18,319
Think on it. Ponder it.

987
01:32:18,450 --> 01:32:22,910
Then spend the rest of your short life
regretting it.

988
01:32:28,334 --> 01:32:30,174
This is not real.

989
01:32:30,295 --> 01:32:34,465
You are just a nightmare.
This is just a nightmare.

990
01:32:34,591 --> 01:32:37,801
You're not real. You're not.

991
01:32:41,473 --> 01:32:45,733
It's too late for that brand
of histrionic denial.

992
01:33:05,830 --> 01:33:10,330
I pledge my daughter, Julia Howard.

993
01:33:18,510 --> 01:33:21,390
I'd love to stay,
and delve in this longer, ms Talben,

994
01:33:21,513 --> 01:33:26,013
but I cannot permit my family
to suffer one moment longer.

995
01:33:31,064 --> 01:33:32,364
Go.

996
01:33:37,821 --> 01:33:39,991
They're waiting for you.

997
01:33:44,494 --> 01:33:45,584
Go.

998
01:33:49,124 --> 01:33:51,384
Adieu, ms Talben.
