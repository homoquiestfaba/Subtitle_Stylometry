1
00:03:00,581 --> 00:03:04,051
Woman: Bless me, father, for i
have sinned. It has been a day
since my last confession.

2
00:03:04,051 --> 00:03:08,489
I saw Agnes Dunn as I was
entering the dry cleaners,

3
00:03:08,489 --> 00:03:11,859
and took the lord's name in
vain.

4
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:15,963
I disrespected sister Joan

5
00:03:15,963 --> 00:03:18,165
by daydreaming in our lady's
altar society meeting.

6
00:03:18,165 --> 00:03:22,703
I believed it was the lesser
of two evils.

7
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:26,173
Often, when I pay attention to
what she's saying,

8
00:03:26,173 --> 00:03:29,310
I begin to have doubts.

9
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:32,280
For this, and so much more,

10
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:36,149
I am terrified I am going to
hell.

11
00:03:39,387 --> 00:03:44,425
The body of Christ.

12
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:51,198
The body of Christ.

13
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:53,000
The blood of Christ.

14
00:03:55,503 --> 00:03:57,170
The body of Christ.

15
00:03:59,106 --> 00:04:00,708
( Loudly ) The blood of Christ.

16
00:04:05,813 --> 00:04:09,783
The body of Christ.

17
00:04:09,783 --> 00:04:12,119
The blood of Christ.

18
00:04:17,691 --> 00:04:22,730
- The body of Christ. - The
blood of Christ.

19
00:04:24,332 --> 00:04:25,466
The body of Christ.

20
00:04:56,530 --> 00:05:01,001
Mrs. cleary, is something
wrong?

21
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:04,472
I lost a contact.

22
00:05:04,472 --> 00:05:05,873
I had that Lasik procedure two
years ago.

23
00:05:05,873 --> 00:05:08,409
It changed my life.

24
00:05:08,409 --> 00:05:10,378
I'm glad to find you alone.

25
00:05:10,378 --> 00:05:12,245
As you know, this is the time
of year

26
00:05:12,245 --> 00:05:13,947
we nominate women for the
catholic woman of the year
award.

27
00:05:13,947 --> 00:05:18,118
Well, I want you.

28
00:05:22,623 --> 00:05:27,260
Thank you, monsignor.

29
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,629
Oh, don't be thankin' me yet.

30
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:29,797
Sister Joan nominated Agnes
Dunn.

31
00:05:29,797 --> 00:05:33,434
Agnes Dunn?

32
00:05:33,434 --> 00:05:35,736
The rest of the committee is
divided.

33
00:05:35,736 --> 00:05:37,905
So sister Joan suggested an
outside party

34
00:05:37,905 --> 00:05:40,441
make the decision.

35
00:05:40,441 --> 00:05:43,444
I offered bishop Donnelly.

36
00:05:43,444 --> 00:05:46,213
Oh. Head of catholic families
together.

37
00:05:46,213 --> 00:05:49,182
Exactly. That's where you're
strong.

38
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:51,218
You have the perfect family.

39
00:05:51,218 --> 00:05:53,821
We'll need frank and the kids

40
00:05:53,821 --> 00:05:55,322
to provide letters of
recommendation

41
00:05:55,322 --> 00:05:56,957
when they meet with bishop
Donnelly.

42
00:05:56,957 --> 00:05:58,759
Meet with him?

43
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:00,461
Oh, yes, yes, at the in-home
visit.

44
00:06:00,461 --> 00:06:02,229
That holds the most weight in
the decision.

45
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:04,898
- Oh. - Oh, Mrs. cleary.

46
00:06:04,898 --> 00:06:07,200
I've been blessed to take tea
at your home.

47
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,136
You could eat off the floors.

48
00:06:09,136 --> 00:06:11,038
Thank you, monsignor.

49
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:13,607
Oh, I probably shouldn't
divulge this,

50
00:06:13,607 --> 00:06:17,144
because it hasn't been
announced yet,

51
00:06:17,144 --> 00:06:19,513
but we're to have a special
guest at the ceremony.

52
00:06:19,513 --> 00:06:22,249
The archbishop of Dublin.

53
00:06:22,249 --> 00:06:23,784
- Oh! - Yes.

54
00:06:25,986 --> 00:06:27,354
The archbishop himself will
offer our most holy sacrament

55
00:06:27,354 --> 00:06:30,257
to the winner.

56
00:06:30,257 --> 00:06:31,592
The prayer of absolution.

57
00:06:31,592 --> 00:06:34,327
All sins forgiven.

58
00:06:35,362 --> 00:06:35,963
( Phone rings )

59
00:06:41,001 --> 00:06:41,835
Hey, ma.

60
00:06:44,938 --> 00:06:46,373
( Whispering ) Monsignor
Murphy has nominated me

61
00:06:46,373 --> 00:06:50,043
for catholic woman of the year.

62
00:06:50,043 --> 00:06:52,179
That's great, ma. No one does
more for the church than you.

63
00:06:52,179 --> 00:06:55,215
Why are you whispering?

64
00:06:55,215 --> 00:06:57,518
Oh, um...

65
00:06:57,518 --> 00:06:59,653
( Normal voice ) I'm still in
church.

66
00:06:59,653 --> 00:07:01,489
It's a sin to boast.

67
00:07:01,489 --> 00:07:03,256
It's Thursday.

68
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:05,659
Why are you still at church?

69
00:07:05,659 --> 00:07:06,827
Look, ma, I have to... I'm
gonna be late for work.

70
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:12,165
( Whispering ) No caffeine.

71
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:13,266
So we'll use the good China
tonight to celebrate.

72
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:16,069
Celebrate?

73
00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:18,872
The nomination.

74
00:07:18,872 --> 00:07:20,641
Shannon, I really wish you
would stop with the emails

75
00:07:20,641 --> 00:07:22,843
when I'm talking to you. This
is important.

76
00:07:22,843 --> 00:07:24,645
Ma, I'm really happy for you,
but I have to leave for work.

77
00:07:24,645 --> 00:07:27,881
All right. Dinner will be at
7:00.

78
00:07:27,881 --> 00:07:29,316
My youth ministry class got
pushed back an hour.

79
00:07:29,316 --> 00:07:33,754
Fine.

80
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:41,595
And Mr. o'Riley can't have any
red meat.

81
00:07:41,595 --> 00:07:44,031
His cholesterol is too high
for the living now.

82
00:07:44,031 --> 00:07:46,033
These are vegetable tamales,
Mrs. cleary.

83
00:07:46,033 --> 00:07:48,435
Here. I made you one.

84
00:07:51,705 --> 00:07:56,544
Lord Jesus, be our guest,

85
00:07:56,544 --> 00:07:57,545
that this food to us be
blessed. Amen.

86
00:07:57,545 --> 00:08:00,548
Amen.

87
00:08:01,248 --> 00:08:02,415
Mmm!

88
00:08:05,418 --> 00:08:07,354
I told you.

89
00:08:07,354 --> 00:08:09,322
How do I make these?

90
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:10,991
Well, I have ay chaparita.

91
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:14,695
- Is something the matter? -
My daughter marcella.

92
00:08:15,195 --> 00:08:16,764
Oh, my!

93
00:08:20,133 --> 00:08:24,037
Are we serving the homebound
cobbed corn?

94
00:08:24,037 --> 00:08:27,575
Um... tamales wrapped in corn
husks.

95
00:08:27,575 --> 00:08:31,411
And they are delicious.

96
00:08:31,411 --> 00:08:33,914
Oh. Well, wrap them up,
because sister Joan suggested

97
00:08:33,914 --> 00:08:37,484
that I take over Megan
O'Donnell's route

98
00:08:37,484 --> 00:08:39,620
since her mother's in hospice.

99
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:42,455
Mmm. Is she at meridian?

100
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:43,591
I have a prayer meeting there
this week, I could look in on
her.

101
00:08:43,591 --> 00:08:47,360
I have no idea.

102
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,430
Did you hear the good news?

103
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:52,966
What good news?

104
00:08:52,966 --> 00:08:54,935
Makes me think about the third
grade

105
00:08:54,935 --> 00:08:57,437
when we were both considered

106
00:08:57,437 --> 00:08:59,773
to lead the may procession,

107
00:08:59,773 --> 00:09:02,275
and then again, in high school.

108
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:04,077
Both considered to play Mary
in the Christmas pageant.

109
00:09:04,077 --> 00:09:06,614
Agnes and I have been
nominated for

110
00:09:06,614 --> 00:09:08,616
catholic woman of the year.

111
00:09:08,616 --> 00:09:10,684
Ah! Congratulations!

112
00:09:10,684 --> 00:09:12,485
And now, here we are again.

113
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:14,655
I have to be going.

114
00:09:14,655 --> 00:09:16,489
I just wanted to say good luck,

115
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:18,491
and I hope you win this time.

116
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:19,993
* it's a perfect day

117
00:09:22,362 --> 00:09:24,497
( humming along to radio )

118
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:26,299
* it's a perfect day

119
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:29,336
* it's a perfect day for you
and me... *

120
00:09:29,336 --> 00:09:32,205
( humming continues )

121
00:09:32,205 --> 00:09:33,807
* it's a perfect day

122
00:09:43,751 --> 00:09:48,789
these tamales better not be
too salty.

123
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:51,324
Congratulations on your
nomination.

124
00:09:53,827 --> 00:09:56,697
Mrs. punch, how on earth do
you know about that?

125
00:09:56,697 --> 00:09:59,900
O'Riley calls us all after you
leave.

126
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:02,903
He's more reliable than the
evening news.

127
00:10:02,903 --> 00:10:06,573
You know you're a shoo-in.

128
00:10:06,573 --> 00:10:08,909
How do you figure that?

129
00:10:08,909 --> 00:10:10,443
Agnes Dunn's cousin married a
protestant.

130
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:14,181
( Both laughing )

131
00:10:14,181 --> 00:10:15,382
Every time something good is
about to happen to me,

132
00:10:17,751 --> 00:10:21,722
Agnes Dunn pops up.

133
00:10:21,722 --> 00:10:23,657
Who lives a more divine life
than you?

134
00:10:23,657 --> 00:10:26,694
You do so much for the church,

135
00:10:26,694 --> 00:10:27,995
it makes St. Nicholas blush.

136
00:10:27,995 --> 00:10:30,563
Oh, Mary!

137
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:32,099
Every day mass, ministry to
shut-ins, meals on wheels.

138
00:10:32,099 --> 00:10:34,968
There isn't a person from two
to 92

139
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:36,770
you don't preach god's
blessings.

140
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:40,373
Thank you.

141
00:10:40,373 --> 00:10:42,776
Even mama would've been proud.

142
00:10:42,776 --> 00:10:45,746
She never had a kind word for
me.

143
00:10:45,746 --> 00:10:47,614
I didn't say she would tell
you she was proud.

144
00:10:47,614 --> 00:10:50,884
Mmm. She'd probably say,

145
00:10:50,884 --> 00:10:52,552
( Irish accent ) "Most people
get this award sooner or later,
Eileen,

146
00:10:52,552 --> 00:10:56,189
but most of them get it a lot
sooner."

147
00:10:58,391 --> 00:11:03,430
Well, wouldn't you be proud if
Shannon got an award like that?

148
00:11:05,232 --> 00:11:07,735
Oh, that's different.

149
00:11:07,735 --> 00:11:10,103
Shannon and I get along great.

150
00:11:10,871 --> 00:11:11,371
- Gonna eat that? - Go ahead.

151
00:11:15,876 --> 00:11:17,310
So Nick asked me if we're both
wearing tuxedos.

152
00:11:19,913 --> 00:11:23,616
Oh, no. He is so uninvited.

153
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:26,820
- Was he serious? - Mm-hmm.

154
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:29,222
Oh, my god.

155
00:11:29,222 --> 00:11:31,558
When do I get to see you in
your dress?

156
00:11:31,558 --> 00:11:34,895
I told you, I'm traditional.

157
00:11:34,895 --> 00:11:37,064
You're gonna have to wait.

158
00:11:37,064 --> 00:11:38,031
So unfair. My mom gets to see
you, and I don't. Not fair.

159
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:41,835
Sorry.

160
00:11:41,835 --> 00:11:43,370
Speaking of mothers...

161
00:11:45,572 --> 00:11:49,943
I know I...

162
00:11:49,943 --> 00:11:52,012
I keep thinking that there'll
be a moment

163
00:11:52,012 --> 00:11:54,815
that feels right, but...

164
00:11:54,815 --> 00:11:57,450
I know.

165
00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:00,120
I have to tell her.

166
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,389
I mean, it's bordering on
ridiculous at this point.

167
00:12:08,195 --> 00:12:13,233
How about you come with me to
dinner tonight?

168
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,603
Tonight?

169
00:12:16,603 --> 00:12:18,505
Yes.

170
00:12:18,505 --> 00:12:20,340
Hmm.

171
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:22,509
What?

172
00:12:22,509 --> 00:12:25,412
I'm just trying to picture it.

173
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:27,680
Me at the cleary family dinner
for the first time in six years.

174
00:12:34,955 --> 00:12:39,993
I could come for dessert.

175
00:12:41,628 --> 00:12:42,362
- That sounds perfect. - Okay.

176
00:12:44,832 --> 00:12:48,869
I have to go.

177
00:12:48,869 --> 00:12:49,602
I'm super behind on those
spring street grants.

178
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:52,339
Right.

179
00:12:52,339 --> 00:12:54,107
I love you.

180
00:12:56,409 --> 00:12:57,710
It's gonna be fine. I'll see
you later.

181
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:00,981
- Bye. - Bye.

182
00:13:15,162 --> 00:13:19,366
Frank!

183
00:13:19,366 --> 00:13:22,435
I've got news.

184
00:13:22,435 --> 00:13:23,871
I've been nominated for
catholic woman of the year.

185
00:13:23,871 --> 00:13:28,408
Yeah? That's great.

186
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:30,210
What's wrong?

187
00:13:32,712 --> 00:13:34,047
Patty called.

188
00:13:34,047 --> 00:13:36,216
He left her again.

189
00:13:38,451 --> 00:13:41,021
He'll be back.

190
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:48,028
Lord Jesus, please.

191
00:13:48,028 --> 00:13:50,530
Help our son frank junior

192
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:52,299
to stop being an idiot and go
back to his wife and children.
Amen.

193
00:13:53,266 --> 00:13:54,767
Where is he?

194
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:58,471
You need to stay out of it.

195
00:13:58,471 --> 00:14:01,508
- He's ruining his life. -
It's his life.

196
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:03,710
You need to let him make his
own decisions.

197
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:05,946
Oh, is that what you were busy
doing

198
00:14:05,946 --> 00:14:07,981
when he got Patty pregnant in
high school?

199
00:14:07,981 --> 00:14:09,549
We shouldn't have pushed him
into marrying somebody

200
00:14:09,549 --> 00:14:11,751
he didn't love.

201
00:14:11,751 --> 00:14:13,053
He's got another woman?

202
00:14:13,053 --> 00:14:15,288
It won't last.

203
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:19,392
He's not like you, frank.

204
00:14:19,392 --> 00:14:21,794
Who is she?

205
00:14:21,794 --> 00:14:23,696
Theresa hennessey.

206
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:26,299
The manicurist?

207
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:56,429
What is it?

208
00:14:56,429 --> 00:14:58,698
There's some bag lady staring
at us.

209
00:15:03,803 --> 00:15:08,441
- Uh... - What?

210
00:15:08,441 --> 00:15:10,843
- Just one second. - Where you
going?

211
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:13,180
I'll just be right back.

212
00:15:14,847 --> 00:15:18,986
Oh, no.

213
00:15:18,986 --> 00:15:21,221
Oh, no!

214
00:15:21,221 --> 00:15:21,888
Ma, what the hell are you
doin' here?

215
00:15:24,324 --> 00:15:27,060
What am I doing here? What are
you doing here?

216
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:29,196
I am not discussing this with
you.

217
00:15:29,196 --> 00:15:31,631
She's older than you are.

218
00:15:31,631 --> 00:15:33,733
You can't even have a mid-life
crisis right.

219
00:15:35,502 --> 00:15:36,769
Who's gonna teach the boys how
to drive?

220
00:15:39,572 --> 00:15:42,375
Ma, I am leaving Patty, I'm
not moving to Siberia.

221
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:45,678
You didn't tell monsignor
Murphy, did you?

222
00:15:45,678 --> 00:15:48,315
Why the hell would I tell him?

223
00:15:48,315 --> 00:15:51,318
Because if you want marriage
counseling,

224
00:15:51,318 --> 00:15:53,386
monsignor Murphy isn't very
good at it.

225
00:15:53,386 --> 00:15:54,721
I think you should go to
another priest, maybe another
parish.

226
00:15:54,721 --> 00:15:57,924
Ma, my marriage is over.

227
00:15:57,924 --> 00:16:00,160
It's been over a long time.

228
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:04,431
You took a vow.

229
00:16:04,431 --> 00:16:06,933
Once you say something, you
can't take it back.

230
00:16:06,933 --> 00:16:10,670
Once you do something, you
can't undo it.

231
00:16:11,704 --> 00:16:12,672
I'll see you at dinner tonight.

232
00:16:15,042 --> 00:16:17,177
Uh, it's at 7:00.

233
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:21,348
The youth group got pushed
back an hour.

234
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:31,624
Ma, do you want me to give him
a call or... ?

235
00:16:31,624 --> 00:16:35,228
( Door opens )

236
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:36,929
You're late.

237
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,069
Sorry. Theresa's sister got
engaged, so...

238
00:16:42,069 --> 00:16:45,072
There was a thing at
O'Malley's.

239
00:16:45,072 --> 00:16:47,207
You were at a bar?

240
00:16:47,207 --> 00:16:47,874
Yes. She got engaged today,
so...

241
00:16:49,942 --> 00:16:51,711
There was a thing.

242
00:16:53,646 --> 00:16:55,715
Okay. Let's eat.

243
00:16:57,117 --> 00:16:57,984
Bless us, o lord,

244
00:17:00,653 --> 00:17:02,655
for these, thy gifts,

245
00:17:02,655 --> 00:17:03,890
we are about to receive from
thy bounty,

246
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:06,159
through Christ our lord. Amen.

247
00:17:06,159 --> 00:17:08,928
All: Amen.

248
00:17:08,928 --> 00:17:09,829
All right, well, let's dig in.

249
00:17:11,831 --> 00:17:13,766
What are you waiting for?

250
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:15,235
What is it?

251
00:17:15,235 --> 00:17:17,570
It looks great, ma.

252
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:20,006
Thank you, Shannon.

253
00:17:20,006 --> 00:17:21,574
Yeah, I thought I'd try a new
recipe.

254
00:17:21,574 --> 00:17:23,743
Vegetarian tamales.

255
00:17:23,743 --> 00:17:26,113
No meat?

256
00:17:26,113 --> 00:17:28,948
Ma, this is excellent.

257
00:17:28,948 --> 00:17:30,250
( Mocking ) Ma, this is
excellent.

258
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:31,918
- ( Thudding sound ) - Ow!

259
00:17:31,918 --> 00:17:34,020
- Will you stop kicking me? -
Will you stop being a jerk?

260
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:35,755
Knock it off. You stop kicking
him,

261
00:17:35,755 --> 00:17:38,291
- you stop being a jerk. - How
am I a jerk?

262
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:40,993
Well, what do you call leaving
your wife and kids,

263
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:44,697
and going to a bar with a
girlfriend?

264
00:17:44,697 --> 00:17:47,167
Oh, boy, here it comes.

265
00:17:47,167 --> 00:17:48,801
Without Patty and the kids,

266
00:17:51,138 --> 00:17:53,406
we had to take a leaf out of
the table.

267
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:55,642
Your father almost strained
his back.

268
00:17:55,642 --> 00:17:58,378
So okay, so now I'm
responsible for dad's back.

269
00:17:58,378 --> 00:18:00,680
Be nice if you took
responsibility for something.

270
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,916
Eileen.

271
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,185
I don't understand what he's
doing.

272
00:18:05,185 --> 00:18:07,654
I'm just trying to be happy,
mom.

273
00:18:07,654 --> 00:18:09,889
Well, who cares if you're
happy?

274
00:18:09,889 --> 00:18:12,024
You need to do the right thing.

275
00:18:14,161 --> 00:18:17,797
Ma, why don't you tell us
about the award?

276
00:18:17,797 --> 00:18:20,333
Oh, well.

277
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:22,001
It's a great honor.

278
00:18:22,001 --> 00:18:24,471
- You deserve it. - Thank you,
Shannon.

279
00:18:24,471 --> 00:18:27,807
See, not only is it just being
nominated,

280
00:18:27,807 --> 00:18:30,543
but there is also a luncheon,

281
00:18:30,543 --> 00:18:34,080
and, um...

282
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,916
And the prayer of absolution.

283
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:37,684
Ma, I don't think you were the
only one who thought

284
00:18:40,253 --> 00:18:41,988
that corn dog was a fish stick.

285
00:18:41,988 --> 00:18:43,990
( Laughter )

286
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:45,892
I have other sins.

287
00:18:45,892 --> 00:18:47,594
Oh, I'll need all of you to
write a personal statement,

288
00:18:50,363 --> 00:18:54,100
a letter of recommendation,
for the monsignor.

289
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:57,770
I don't know much about your
church work.

290
00:18:57,770 --> 00:19:00,940
I think it's more sort of
personal reference.

291
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:04,010
Sure. We can do that for you.

292
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:04,944
And also, they...

293
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:09,549
They want to meet you, too.

294
00:19:09,549 --> 00:19:12,018
Why do they want to meet us?

295
00:19:12,018 --> 00:19:13,686
Well, just to see if, you know,

296
00:19:13,686 --> 00:19:17,690
everything's okay.

297
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:19,992
What does that mean?

298
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:22,262
Well, if everything is normal.

299
00:19:22,262 --> 00:19:25,598
Ma, what are you talking about?

300
00:19:25,598 --> 00:19:29,035
Well, that you are not married
and over 30.

301
00:19:31,238 --> 00:19:33,706
Is that a new sin I'm not
aware of?

302
00:19:33,706 --> 00:19:36,276
No, I just think it would be
nice

303
00:19:36,276 --> 00:19:38,711
if you told the committee

304
00:19:38,711 --> 00:19:39,712
you were dating a good
catholic man.

305
00:19:39,712 --> 00:19:42,815
Dad.

306
00:19:42,815 --> 00:19:45,452
So you want her to lie.

307
00:19:45,452 --> 00:19:46,886
Or you could start dating a
good catholic man.

308
00:19:46,886 --> 00:19:50,990
I want her to try.

309
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:53,593
Ma, it's never going to happen.

310
00:19:53,593 --> 00:19:56,028
Oh, if Fiona Doyle's obese
daughter can get a man,

311
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:59,999
well, so can you.

312
00:19:59,999 --> 00:20:03,470
Are you all right?

313
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:05,672
I'm fine. ( Clears throat )

314
00:20:05,672 --> 00:20:06,806
Maybe we should change the
subject.

315
00:20:06,806 --> 00:20:09,175
No.

316
00:20:09,175 --> 00:20:10,477
I don't need a man.

317
00:20:12,979 --> 00:20:15,482
I have Angela.

318
00:20:15,482 --> 00:20:18,251
Well, honey, friends are nice,

319
00:20:18,251 --> 00:20:22,389
but at your age,

320
00:20:22,389 --> 00:20:23,890
you should start thinking
about a family.

321
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:26,593
We are family.

322
00:20:26,593 --> 00:20:29,462
Angela and I are together,

323
00:20:29,462 --> 00:20:31,898
and I'm five months' pregnant.

324
00:20:40,373 --> 00:20:44,744
- That's not funny. - (
Doorbell rings )

325
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:49,148
It's true, ma.

326
00:20:51,318 --> 00:20:52,184
I don't know what you're
talking about.

327
00:20:53,953 --> 00:20:55,988
You know. You must know.

328
00:20:55,988 --> 00:20:59,125
I live with a woman.

329
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:01,027
- I never date men. - ( Door
opens )

330
00:21:01,027 --> 00:21:03,330
- Hi. - Hi.

331
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:05,197
Thanks.

332
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:07,867
Uh, I don't want to know about
this.

333
00:21:10,036 --> 00:21:13,473
What part, ma?

334
00:21:13,473 --> 00:21:14,541
What part don't you want to
know anything about?

335
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:17,844
Me? Your grandchild?

336
00:21:17,844 --> 00:21:19,346
You're talking crazy.

337
00:21:19,346 --> 00:21:23,750
Eileen.

338
00:21:24,917 --> 00:21:29,822
Great. All right then. I'm
going to go.

339
00:21:31,824 --> 00:21:32,992
I'll pray for you.

340
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:38,531
Pray for yourself.

341
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:44,103
Come on.

342
00:21:57,550 --> 00:22:02,154
You know, I got married to
frank in a thrift store gown

343
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:05,392
borrowed from cousin rose.

344
00:22:05,392 --> 00:22:08,127
I always dreamed better for
Shannon.

345
00:22:08,127 --> 00:22:10,430
She's a lawyer.

346
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:13,265
I'd say your dreams came true.

347
00:22:13,265 --> 00:22:14,601
It was monsignor Murphy who
made sure she got that
scholarship.

348
00:22:14,601 --> 00:22:19,038
Every good thing my family has,

349
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:21,741
the church has made possible,
and now...

350
00:22:22,842 --> 00:22:23,943
Did Shannon tell you about
those meetings,

351
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:30,450
you know, for families of gay
people?

352
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:33,553
You sound like frank.

353
00:22:33,553 --> 00:22:34,987
Meetings can be helpful.

354
00:22:34,987 --> 00:22:38,825
Like the al-anon meeting

355
00:22:38,825 --> 00:22:41,628
where that woman went on about
hiding money from her drunken
husband

356
00:22:41,628 --> 00:22:44,063
- in her douche bag? - That
was just one meeting.

357
00:22:44,063 --> 00:22:45,798
What kind of person does
something like that?

358
00:22:45,798 --> 00:22:48,034
Eileen...

359
00:22:48,034 --> 00:22:50,102
What sort of woman hides money
in a douche bag,

360
00:22:50,102 --> 00:22:52,439
- Eileen... - And then talks
about it in public?

361
00:22:52,439 --> 00:22:55,174
It's not about the douche bag.

362
00:22:56,943 --> 00:22:57,209
I don't need meetings.

363
00:23:00,447 --> 00:23:03,115
There's nothing wrong with me.

364
00:23:03,115 --> 00:23:05,051
I just need my family to
behave the way they're supposed
to.

365
00:23:06,285 --> 00:23:10,122
( Phone rings )

366
00:23:13,025 --> 00:23:17,864
Hello.

367
00:23:20,299 --> 00:23:25,004
My daughter is Shannon cleary.

368
00:23:25,004 --> 00:23:27,206
Eileen. Shannon's in with the
doctor,

369
00:23:27,206 --> 00:23:29,542
and frank is waiting around
the corner in the waiting room.

370
00:23:29,542 --> 00:23:32,545
Who are you?

371
00:23:32,545 --> 00:23:34,346
Oh, I'm Christina, Angela's
mom.

372
00:23:34,346 --> 00:23:36,382
- I'm Eileen's sister, Mary. -
Come on.

373
00:23:36,382 --> 00:23:38,485
Frank is right this way.

374
00:23:38,485 --> 00:23:39,852
They're here.

375
00:23:41,387 --> 00:23:44,791
What happened?

376
00:23:44,791 --> 00:23:46,726
Shannon called me on the way
to the hospital.

377
00:23:46,726 --> 00:23:48,495
- She called you. - Eileen.

378
00:23:48,495 --> 00:23:50,830
There was some blood.

379
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:53,199
The doctor told Angela to meet
her here.

380
00:23:53,199 --> 00:23:55,367
What did the doctor say?

381
00:23:55,367 --> 00:23:57,570
She hasn't come out yet.

382
00:23:57,570 --> 00:23:59,539
You must be Mrs. cleary.

383
00:23:59,539 --> 00:24:01,641
I'm Lou reyes, Angela's father.

384
00:24:01,641 --> 00:24:04,811
Nice to meet you.

385
00:24:08,414 --> 00:24:12,652
Maybe you should wait in the
car.

386
00:24:12,652 --> 00:24:15,321
- Yeah. - Okay.

387
00:24:17,123 --> 00:24:20,927
You've gotta be kidding me. An
insufficient cervix.

388
00:24:20,927 --> 00:24:24,430
( Laughter )

389
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:25,364
And the doctor said it could
also be referred to as an
incompetent cervix.

390
00:24:25,364 --> 00:24:28,835
Oh, great!

391
00:24:28,835 --> 00:24:30,269
I'm already insufficient and
incompetent,

392
00:24:30,269 --> 00:24:32,338
and the baby isn't even here
yet.

393
00:24:32,338 --> 00:24:35,174
- ( Laughter ) - It isn't
funny.

394
00:24:35,174 --> 00:24:38,811
( Laughter stops )

395
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:39,245
Sorry, folks. Visiting hours
are over.

396
00:24:41,914 --> 00:24:45,417
Oh, shoot.

397
00:24:45,417 --> 00:24:47,019
- Thanks, mom. - Thanks for
coming.

398
00:24:47,019 --> 00:24:49,556
Take care.

399
00:24:49,556 --> 00:24:50,456
- Bye, dad. - Get some sleep,
okay?

400
00:24:50,456 --> 00:24:52,892
I will. I'll try.

401
00:24:52,892 --> 00:24:54,794
- I'll bring the car around. -
All right.

402
00:24:57,664 --> 00:25:00,733
- See you later, frank. - See
ya.

403
00:25:01,568 --> 00:25:01,868
So I talked to the doctor.

404
00:25:05,004 --> 00:25:06,573
You have to take this
seriously.

405
00:25:06,573 --> 00:25:09,742
I do.

406
00:25:09,742 --> 00:25:12,178
She doesn't want you going to
the office.

407
00:25:12,178 --> 00:25:14,113
She wants you off your feet
most of the day.

408
00:25:14,113 --> 00:25:16,482
You're gonna have to get
someone to help.

409
00:25:16,482 --> 00:25:19,218
Eileen: I can help.

410
00:25:19,218 --> 00:25:20,887
We'll manage.

411
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:25,257
I can clean and shop, cook...

412
00:25:25,257 --> 00:25:30,062
When Angela's at work.

413
00:25:30,963 --> 00:25:32,832
Ma...

414
00:25:35,134 --> 00:25:37,770
You need me.

415
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:40,807
Shan, it would be a big help.

416
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:44,076
You've never even been to my
apartment.

417
00:25:46,613 --> 00:25:50,449
You hate highways.

418
00:25:52,084 --> 00:25:53,185
( Horn honking )

419
00:26:12,504 --> 00:26:16,909
Mrs. cleary.

420
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:19,045
- Come in. - Thank you.

421
00:26:19,045 --> 00:26:20,512
Sorry, I'm running late for a
meeting,

422
00:26:22,682 --> 00:26:24,250
or I'd give you the tour.

423
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:26,052
Oh, no, I'm fine.

424
00:26:26,052 --> 00:26:28,054
You go ahead.

425
00:26:28,054 --> 00:26:29,188
Shannon should be off the
phone soon.

426
00:26:29,188 --> 00:26:30,957
Right.

427
00:26:30,957 --> 00:26:34,326
We appreciate you being here.

428
00:26:34,326 --> 00:26:35,662
No, I gave Steve...

429
00:26:35,662 --> 00:26:38,665
Uh, I'm sorry.

430
00:26:38,665 --> 00:26:40,933
I gave Steve all the
instructions.

431
00:26:40,933 --> 00:26:44,170
And they're happy with the
contract as it is?

432
00:26:48,741 --> 00:26:53,412
Sorry, Robert. I didn't hear
you.

433
00:26:53,412 --> 00:26:55,281
Well, can't they push it up?

434
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:59,151
No, ma, leave those on the
rack.

435
00:27:01,754 --> 00:27:03,289
No, if you hang pots, they
just collect dust.

436
00:27:03,289 --> 00:27:07,193
Ma, I like

437
00:27:07,193 --> 00:27:08,861
but then, when you wanna use
'em, you have to wash 'em.

438
00:27:08,861 --> 00:27:10,863
Rob, let me call you back.

439
00:27:10,863 --> 00:27:12,965
Hand me the bread. I'll start
breakfast.

440
00:27:12,965 --> 00:27:15,935
Oh, no, I had coffee.

441
00:27:15,935 --> 00:27:19,371
Decaf.

442
00:27:19,371 --> 00:27:21,207
Half a cup of decaf.

443
00:27:23,175 --> 00:27:27,246
Okay.

444
00:27:27,246 --> 00:27:28,715
Eggs.

445
00:27:28,715 --> 00:27:31,718
Okay.

446
00:27:31,718 --> 00:27:34,220
Why are you wearing a suit?

447
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:36,522
Well, I'm working.

448
00:27:36,522 --> 00:27:38,457
From home, but I'm working.

449
00:27:40,026 --> 00:27:40,459
Were you going to make
Shepherd's pie?

450
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:46,999
I thought I would.

451
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:48,400
Yeah, after I make you
breakfast,

452
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,069
I'm gonna fix something for
lunch and dinner.

453
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:57,076
Her friend Maria put a skull
and crossbones on her arm.

454
00:27:57,076 --> 00:27:59,946
What does she think she is, a
pirate?

455
00:27:59,946 --> 00:28:02,749
Oh, Mrs. cleary, there you are.

456
00:28:02,749 --> 00:28:04,951
- Good day, carmelita. - Good
day, monsignor.

457
00:28:04,951 --> 00:28:06,853
Can I talk with you about the
home visit next week?

458
00:28:06,853 --> 00:28:09,488
Oh, yes, of course.

459
00:28:09,488 --> 00:28:11,423
The archbishop is a go.

460
00:28:11,423 --> 00:28:13,125
We have confirmation from the
pontifical council.

461
00:28:13,125 --> 00:28:15,895
- How exciting. - Yes, it is.

462
00:28:15,895 --> 00:28:18,330
It's put us all into a
pressure cooker.

463
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:20,099
The archdiocese wants to make
sure our choice is beyond
reproach.

464
00:28:20,099 --> 00:28:22,769
That's why it's so important
the home visit goes well,

465
00:28:22,769 --> 00:28:27,006
to ensure you're our choice.

466
00:28:27,006 --> 00:28:29,575
Everyone should be there,
frank, frank Jr., Shannon.

467
00:28:29,575 --> 00:28:33,279
The grandchildren.

468
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:34,881
Well, Shannon isn't feeling
very well.

469
00:28:34,881 --> 00:28:36,916
I don't know if she can make
it.

470
00:28:36,916 --> 00:28:39,018
Oh, that could be tricky.

471
00:28:39,018 --> 00:28:41,020
Well, if she can't make it, be
sure and explain why.

472
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:44,590
Talk about her church duties,

473
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:46,692
what her fianceé does.

474
00:28:46,692 --> 00:28:48,660
She's not officially engaged.

475
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:51,430
What is it with young men
these days?

476
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:53,599
What are they waiting for, the
second coming?

477
00:28:53,599 --> 00:28:55,401
- Hey, ma. - Yes.

478
00:28:57,837 --> 00:29:00,539
Dr. chen wanted me to ask you

479
00:29:00,539 --> 00:29:03,042
about your hysterectomy.

480
00:29:03,042 --> 00:29:07,346
Why?

481
00:29:07,346 --> 00:29:09,381
Well, she thinks it might be
relevant to my condition.

482
00:29:09,381 --> 00:29:13,820
It's not.

483
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:14,520
Well, you sure, because you
were pretty young?

484
00:29:18,257 --> 00:29:20,059
She just wants to know if my
condition is hereditary.

485
00:29:20,059 --> 00:29:24,330
I didn't have that short
cervix thing.

486
00:29:24,997 --> 00:29:26,565
So what did you have?

487
00:29:28,835 --> 00:29:31,003
Shannon, some things are
personal,

488
00:29:31,003 --> 00:29:34,706
and best left to prayer.

489
00:29:36,208 --> 00:29:37,309
What is this?

490
00:29:39,411 --> 00:29:41,313
That was a gift.

491
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:48,587
Is there anything that you
want to ask me?

492
00:29:48,587 --> 00:29:52,591
Hi. We're home.

493
00:29:52,591 --> 00:29:53,425
Oh, my, what did you get?

494
00:29:57,263 --> 00:29:59,398
It's from my sister in Miami,
for the baby.

495
00:29:59,398 --> 00:30:02,969
It's a little early for that,
isn't it?

496
00:30:02,969 --> 00:30:04,603
In my family, we celebrate
Christmas in July.

497
00:30:06,172 --> 00:30:07,206
Oh, my god. My feet are
killing me.

498
00:30:10,009 --> 00:30:13,812
This one schlepped me all over
town

499
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:15,882
looking for decorations for
the wedding.

500
00:30:15,882 --> 00:30:18,084
Oh. Somebody's getting married?

501
00:30:21,153 --> 00:30:25,524
Angela and I are getting
married

502
00:30:25,524 --> 00:30:28,494
next Sunday.

503
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:30,229
Lou and I, we insist that they
have a cer...

504
00:30:33,065 --> 00:30:36,502
A party, really,

505
00:30:36,502 --> 00:30:38,270
but being that the baby's
coming and all that...

506
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:40,940
We would love for you and
frank to be there.

507
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:43,042
I didn't mention it because i
didn't think

508
00:30:43,042 --> 00:30:45,644
that you would come.

509
00:30:45,644 --> 00:30:47,046
Of course you'll come.

510
00:30:49,248 --> 00:30:51,250
Possibly. If it's after church.

511
00:30:57,823 --> 00:31:02,694
Open it.

512
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:03,195
- Do you know what it is? -
Uh-uh.

513
00:31:04,997 --> 00:31:07,934
I have no idea.

514
00:31:07,934 --> 00:31:10,569
( All exclaiming )

515
00:31:10,569 --> 00:31:13,940
Oh, my...

516
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:16,208
That's beautiful. Are those
diapers?

517
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:18,844
It's so cheesy. It's cute,
it's cute. We'll use it.

518
00:31:18,844 --> 00:31:20,146
The call to marriage is woven
deeply into the human spirit.

519
00:31:24,516 --> 00:31:28,787
What makes a nun an expert on
marriage?

520
00:31:28,787 --> 00:31:30,322
If you would like to hear
bishop Reynolds' lecture on
marriage

521
00:31:30,322 --> 00:31:33,792
and the complementarity of the
sexes,

522
00:31:33,792 --> 00:31:35,694
here is all the information.

523
00:31:35,694 --> 00:31:37,496
I highly recommend it.

524
00:31:37,496 --> 00:31:40,532
It's about time

525
00:31:40,532 --> 00:31:42,534
I see our time is up.

526
00:31:42,534 --> 00:31:44,570
Oh, please remember, it is
girl scout cookie season.

527
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:47,839
Our parking lot will host
several tables this weekend.

528
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:52,044
Make sure you use the rear
parking lot

529
00:31:52,044 --> 00:31:54,413
when you come to mass this
Sunday.

530
00:31:54,413 --> 00:31:56,682
Mrs. cleary, does monsignor
Murphy have

531
00:31:56,682 --> 00:31:59,551
your letters of recommendation?

532
00:31:59,551 --> 00:32:01,720
Not yet, but I'm sure he will
soon.

533
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:04,356
See that he does.

534
00:32:04,356 --> 00:32:06,993
Yes, sister.

535
00:32:06,993 --> 00:32:08,660
I have to go deliver meals to
the homebound.

536
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:12,164
Oh, I'm done with all that.

537
00:32:12,164 --> 00:32:14,166
Megan O'Donnell's mother's
finally died,

538
00:32:14,166 --> 00:32:15,901
so she's got the time now.

539
00:32:15,901 --> 00:32:18,004
And giving her back her route

540
00:32:18,004 --> 00:32:21,407
really is the only Christian
thing to do.

541
00:32:21,407 --> 00:32:22,408
Did you hear that my youngest,
Peter's, been promoted to
lieutenant?

542
00:32:25,077 --> 00:32:28,247
- Congratulations. - Thanks.

543
00:32:28,247 --> 00:32:31,350
And Michael was promoted to
captain.

544
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:34,020
Of course, frank Jr.'s a
captain, isn't he?

545
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:36,122
- No, he's a lieutenant. - Oh?

546
00:32:36,122 --> 00:32:39,825
Speaking of frank Jr.,

547
00:32:39,825 --> 00:32:42,328
what is Patty's secret for
keeping him so well-groomed?

548
00:32:43,095 --> 00:32:44,630
What do you mean?

549
00:32:47,033 --> 00:32:48,767
Well, my cousin owns the real
estate office

550
00:32:48,767 --> 00:32:51,870
just right across the street
from Theresa hennessey's salon.

551
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:54,873
She said that she saw frank
Jr. there nearly every day this
week.

552
00:32:54,873 --> 00:32:59,178
And I can't even get Carl to
trim his nose hairs, so what is
her secret?

553
00:32:59,178 --> 00:33:03,149
I wouldn't know.

554
00:33:03,149 --> 00:33:05,817
Have a good day.

555
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:07,919
Oh, sorry.

556
00:33:15,061 --> 00:33:19,265
All right, so have you, um...

557
00:33:19,265 --> 00:33:22,668
Picked a color yet?

558
00:33:29,941 --> 00:33:34,813
Okay. That's a nice color.

559
00:33:38,617 --> 00:33:42,854
What did you do, ma?

560
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:44,890
We just talked.

561
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:47,126
Oh, you just talked.

562
00:33:47,126 --> 00:33:48,994
She not only broke up with me,

563
00:33:48,994 --> 00:33:50,596
she decided to close the salon
on Sundays.

564
00:33:50,596 --> 00:33:53,132
Theresa's not a catholic, is
she?

565
00:33:53,132 --> 00:33:56,435
Is that what this is about,

566
00:33:56,435 --> 00:33:58,104
- that she's not catholic? - (
Turns vacuum off )

567
00:33:58,104 --> 00:33:59,838
It's about, she's not your
wife.

568
00:34:02,108 --> 00:34:02,308
All right, just stay out of my
life, ma.

569
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:07,146
You are ruining your life.

570
00:34:07,146 --> 00:34:10,015
You never even liked Patty.

571
00:34:10,015 --> 00:34:12,751
This is about you.

572
00:34:12,751 --> 00:34:14,653
I don't want you walking
around with regrets.

573
00:34:14,653 --> 00:34:18,190
- They eat at your soul. - How
do you not see

574
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:20,692
that my whole life has been
one long regret?

575
00:34:20,692 --> 00:34:23,762
One stupid night.

576
00:34:23,762 --> 00:34:26,432
You have to live with the
choices you've made.

577
00:34:28,033 --> 00:34:29,368
I had one thing...

578
00:34:32,504 --> 00:34:35,874
And she meant something to me.

579
00:34:46,285 --> 00:34:51,223
I was just gonna do the same...

580
00:34:51,223 --> 00:34:52,991
Wear it the same way I wear it
every day.

581
00:34:52,991 --> 00:34:56,328
- Oh, honey. - What?

582
00:34:56,328 --> 00:34:57,329
- I could do it for you. - I
wanna look like myself.

583
00:34:57,329 --> 00:34:59,998
What are you doing here?

584
00:34:59,998 --> 00:35:01,567
Didn't you get my message?

585
00:35:01,567 --> 00:35:03,001
You nearly had a miscarriage.

586
00:35:03,001 --> 00:35:05,171
You have no business playing
baseball.

587
00:35:05,171 --> 00:35:07,005
I'm just watching Angela's
soccer game, ma.

588
00:35:07,005 --> 00:35:10,242
You should be in bed.

589
00:35:10,242 --> 00:35:11,543
The doctor said it's okay as
long as I sit.

590
00:35:11,543 --> 00:35:14,246
Did you make me a fruitcake?

591
00:35:14,246 --> 00:35:16,014
You have to go home now.

592
00:35:18,317 --> 00:35:20,085
Well, I'm pretty sure if we
play the game there,

593
00:35:20,085 --> 00:35:21,753
someone will knock the pans
off the wall.

594
00:35:21,753 --> 00:35:23,855
This is not a joke.

595
00:35:23,855 --> 00:35:26,458
Ma, ma, calm down. I feel fine.

596
00:35:26,458 --> 00:35:30,028
Well, you shouldn't have
walked here.

597
00:35:30,028 --> 00:35:31,730
Oh, Eileen, she didn't. I
drove her.

598
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:34,866
I was going stir crazy.

599
00:35:34,866 --> 00:35:36,668
We thought if she got out in
the sun, it would be good for
her.

600
00:35:37,703 --> 00:35:38,904
Well, I guess it's all right
then.

601
00:35:41,573 --> 00:35:44,576
Ma, why don't you release the
fruitcake

602
00:35:44,576 --> 00:35:47,646
and sit down?

603
00:35:47,646 --> 00:35:49,080
No, I can't stay. There's so
much to do

604
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:51,082
with the bishop's visit.

605
00:35:51,082 --> 00:35:53,419
- Oh! - Sorry.

606
00:35:53,419 --> 00:35:55,053
Ang, it's almost game time.

607
00:35:55,053 --> 00:35:57,223
Okay. Put it over here.

608
00:35:57,223 --> 00:35:59,225
Oh, honey, don't put it there.
Ants. Over there.

609
00:35:59,225 --> 00:36:01,893
Here, put it on the chair.

610
00:36:01,893 --> 00:36:04,596
Have a good game.

611
00:36:09,835 --> 00:36:14,240
She's worried about you.

612
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,842
* your mother loves you

613
00:36:23,415 --> 00:36:27,819
what are you doing here?

614
00:36:27,819 --> 00:36:30,589
Lookin' for you.

615
00:36:30,589 --> 00:36:32,291
Shannon said you went home,
but I knew better.

616
00:36:32,291 --> 00:36:35,093
She should not be here.

617
00:36:35,093 --> 00:36:37,396
Ah, you're a doctor now?

618
00:36:37,396 --> 00:36:38,697
She could be hit in the
stomach by a baseball.

619
00:36:38,697 --> 00:36:41,567
Yeah, that's unlikely in a
soccer game.

620
00:36:41,567 --> 00:36:44,002
Well, no balls should be
around her.

621
00:36:45,571 --> 00:36:46,472
Oh, you... you're sick.

622
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:55,347
Let's, uh...

623
00:36:55,347 --> 00:36:58,149
Let's go for a walk.

624
00:36:58,149 --> 00:37:00,619
I'm watching Shannon.

625
00:37:00,619 --> 00:37:03,522
Okay, let's watch Shannon.

626
00:37:05,156 --> 00:37:05,524
We have to talk about this
wedding.

627
00:37:08,193 --> 00:37:12,298
Why?

628
00:37:12,298 --> 00:37:13,432
I don't understand any of this.

629
00:37:15,534 --> 00:37:19,104
Maybe you don't have to.

630
00:37:19,104 --> 00:37:21,640
You think we should go, don't
you?

631
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:25,477
I do.

632
00:37:25,477 --> 00:37:26,678
It's probably at some woman's
commune.

633
00:37:29,315 --> 00:37:31,917
Worse. It's at Christina's
house.

634
00:37:32,818 --> 00:37:35,086
Oh, god.

635
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:49,368
The cleary clan!

636
00:37:49,368 --> 00:37:51,903
Hey! I love what you're
wearing.

637
00:37:51,903 --> 00:37:54,906
- Hi! - Hi.

638
00:37:54,906 --> 00:37:56,342
This is so beautiful.

639
00:37:56,342 --> 00:37:59,244
Eileen.

640
00:37:59,244 --> 00:38:00,346
You look fantastic.

641
00:38:00,346 --> 00:38:03,214
Oh...

642
00:38:03,214 --> 00:38:04,816
Frank, how about a hand, huh?

643
00:38:04,816 --> 00:38:06,151
You wanna eat? There's plenty
of food in there. Welcome.

644
00:38:06,151 --> 00:38:08,987
Welcome, welcome.

645
00:38:08,987 --> 00:38:11,357
Father Joe, this is frank and
Eileen cleary.

646
00:38:11,357 --> 00:38:16,194
Shannon's parents.

647
00:38:16,194 --> 00:38:17,363
Lovely to meet you, Mr. and
Mrs. cleary. It's a privilege
to be here.

648
00:38:17,363 --> 00:38:20,766
Thank you, father.

649
00:38:20,766 --> 00:38:21,800
Father Joe will be performing
the ceremony.

650
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:25,003
Woman: Christina!

651
00:38:25,003 --> 00:38:26,838
You'll notice that my full
name isn't in the program.

652
00:38:26,838 --> 00:38:29,475
It's kind of a risk for me to
be here.

653
00:38:29,475 --> 00:38:32,110
It's also an honor to
participate in

654
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:34,045
Angela and Shannon's holy
union.

655
00:38:34,045 --> 00:38:35,013
Mrs. cleary, I wanted to
actually give you my card,

656
00:38:37,883 --> 00:38:40,886
in case you ever feel like
talking.

657
00:38:40,886 --> 00:38:42,754
Would either of you like
something to drink?

658
00:38:44,523 --> 00:38:46,958
Frank's a drunk.

659
00:38:54,933 --> 00:38:59,771
Don't look at me.

660
00:38:59,771 --> 00:39:01,239
He asked to be left alone, I'm
leaving him alone.

661
00:39:02,641 --> 00:39:03,942
( Processional music begins )

662
00:39:37,509 --> 00:39:42,347
Please be seated.

663
00:39:43,715 --> 00:39:44,583
This is an occasion of great
joy.

664
00:39:47,653 --> 00:39:50,288
We gather to witness the
exchanging of vows

665
00:39:50,288 --> 00:39:53,559
between Angela and Shannon.

666
00:39:53,559 --> 00:39:56,127
As I pray that god invokes his
blessings on the couple,

667
00:39:56,127 --> 00:39:59,164
I invite each of you to
quietly, and in your own way,

668
00:39:59,164 --> 00:40:02,300
also pray that god blesses
Angela and Shannon

669
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:05,637
and their intentions.

670
00:40:05,637 --> 00:40:07,673
In the presence of god,

671
00:40:07,673 --> 00:40:09,808
and loving friends, do you,
Angela,

672
00:40:09,808 --> 00:40:12,611
take Shannon to be your spouse

673
00:40:12,611 --> 00:40:14,112
and your partner in life?

674
00:40:14,112 --> 00:40:15,346
I do.

675
00:40:18,116 --> 00:40:18,684
In the presence of god and
loved ones and loving friends,

676
00:40:21,319 --> 00:40:24,590
do you, Shannon, take Angela

677
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:26,057
to be your spouse and your
partner in life?

678
00:40:26,057 --> 00:40:27,959
I do.

679
00:40:30,095 --> 00:40:31,229
May I see your rings?

680
00:40:34,733 --> 00:40:35,300
I declare these rings to be a
symbol of your sacred vows.

681
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:42,107
Shannon...

682
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:48,113
I give you this ring as a
symbol

683
00:40:48,113 --> 00:40:50,949
of my commitment to you.

684
00:40:50,949 --> 00:40:53,752
May it remind you always that
you are surrounded

685
00:40:53,752 --> 00:40:56,087
( voice echoing ) By my
eternal love...

686
00:40:56,622 --> 00:41:00,492
And devotion.

687
00:41:00,492 --> 00:41:03,762
( Shannon's voice echoing )
Angela...

688
00:41:03,762 --> 00:41:07,533
I give you this ring as a
symbol of my commitment.

689
00:41:07,533 --> 00:41:11,803
May it remind you always

690
00:41:11,803 --> 00:41:14,172
that you are surrounded by my
enduring love

691
00:41:14,172 --> 00:41:17,108
and devotion.

692
00:41:17,108 --> 00:41:18,276
Father Joe: You may now
exchange a kiss

693
00:41:21,079 --> 00:41:23,348
as a sign of the sacred
sacrament.

694
00:41:29,054 --> 00:41:33,124
Are you okay?

695
00:41:33,124 --> 00:41:35,927
No cuts.

696
00:41:35,927 --> 00:41:37,362
Come on. Let's go get you
dried off.

697
00:41:43,935 --> 00:41:48,574
Here you go.

698
00:41:48,574 --> 00:41:50,208
- Thank you. - Oh, not a
problem.

699
00:41:50,208 --> 00:41:52,578
It's all good.

700
00:41:52,578 --> 00:41:54,746
How do you accept this?

701
00:41:54,746 --> 00:41:56,181
Shannon is a lovely girl.

702
00:42:00,919 --> 00:42:01,386
It was really hard for me

703
00:42:05,490 --> 00:42:08,594
when Angie first told me.

704
00:42:08,594 --> 00:42:11,930
But that's normal.

705
00:42:11,930 --> 00:42:13,665
You should talk to father Joe.

706
00:42:13,665 --> 00:42:15,767
Oh, he was a big help for me.

707
00:42:15,767 --> 00:42:18,203
He's a catholic priest.

708
00:42:18,203 --> 00:42:20,305
Father Joe believes

709
00:42:20,305 --> 00:42:21,607
that we all do the best we can.

710
00:42:21,607 --> 00:42:26,077
What does that mean?

711
00:42:27,212 --> 00:42:27,946
Come join the party,

712
00:42:30,415 --> 00:42:33,819
get cleaned up,

713
00:42:33,819 --> 00:42:36,254
'cause I can't wait to see you
in my track suit.

714
00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:58,209
You look nice in that outfit.

715
00:42:58,209 --> 00:43:02,013
( Huffs )

716
00:43:02,013 --> 00:43:03,214
You know, they've taken quite
a few cruises,

717
00:43:05,651 --> 00:43:08,019
and say they're a great
vacation.

718
00:43:08,019 --> 00:43:10,355
- Who? - Christina and Lou.

719
00:43:10,355 --> 00:43:11,857
Ah! Bless, o lord, and
sanctify the flesh of this bird.

720
00:43:11,857 --> 00:43:15,393
In Jesus Christ our lord. Amen.

721
00:43:15,393 --> 00:43:17,195
Amen. You know, on a big ship.

722
00:43:17,195 --> 00:43:19,497
Christina said the food is
wonderful.

723
00:43:19,497 --> 00:43:22,533
They go to great places,

724
00:43:22,533 --> 00:43:24,936
and there's dancing every
night.

725
00:43:24,936 --> 00:43:26,537
What are you talking about?

726
00:43:26,537 --> 00:43:28,674
A vacation.

727
00:43:28,674 --> 00:43:30,876
- A vacation? - Yeah.

728
00:43:30,876 --> 00:43:33,178
You know, like we used to.

729
00:43:33,178 --> 00:43:35,346
Vegas, Reno, Italy.

730
00:43:35,346 --> 00:43:37,348
We never went to Italy.

731
00:43:38,717 --> 00:43:40,886
I know that.

732
00:43:40,886 --> 00:43:43,088
But you always wanted to go,
remember?

733
00:43:43,088 --> 00:43:45,023
Hmm? You wanted to see the
David,

734
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:47,959
visit Rome.

735
00:43:47,959 --> 00:43:49,995
All those beautiful churches.

736
00:43:49,995 --> 00:43:52,463
That was a long time ago.

737
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:55,433
Yeah, but we could go, Eileen.

738
00:43:57,235 --> 00:43:57,568
I'm saying we could go.

739
00:44:01,606 --> 00:44:05,744
It would be good for us.

740
00:44:05,744 --> 00:44:07,345
It would've been good for us
20 years ago.

741
00:44:07,345 --> 00:44:10,849
I know.

742
00:44:10,849 --> 00:44:12,784
You wanna go on a vacation.

743
00:44:12,784 --> 00:44:15,954
Our family...

744
00:44:15,954 --> 00:44:18,724
Is falling apart...

745
00:44:18,724 --> 00:44:20,726
And you wanna take a cruise.

746
00:44:20,726 --> 00:44:23,361
You liked it before,

747
00:44:23,361 --> 00:44:24,763
Eileen, when I was drunk,
running around?

748
00:44:24,763 --> 00:44:27,365
Our children shared nothing
with us.

749
00:44:27,365 --> 00:44:30,401
Shannon is havin' a baby.

750
00:44:30,401 --> 00:44:32,437
This should be the best time
in our lives.

751
00:44:32,437 --> 00:44:34,740
All right, frank.

752
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:36,908
All right.

753
00:44:36,908 --> 00:44:39,010
Don't forget the circulars at
the end of the driveway.

754
00:44:56,427 --> 00:45:00,966
Can't that wait until you get
to the office?

755
00:45:00,966 --> 00:45:03,969
This isn't work stuff.

756
00:45:03,969 --> 00:45:05,436
This is us stuff.

757
00:45:05,436 --> 00:45:08,039
What is it?

758
00:45:08,039 --> 00:45:09,941
Well, she's gonna need a safe
place to play,

759
00:45:09,941 --> 00:45:12,643
but I wanna keep the open feel.

760
00:45:12,643 --> 00:45:15,313
Oh, carpets.

761
00:45:15,313 --> 00:45:17,315
Play mats.

762
00:45:17,315 --> 00:45:19,785
Aww.

763
00:45:19,785 --> 00:45:21,386
I think it looks perfect.

764
00:45:21,386 --> 00:45:24,956
Yeah.

765
00:45:30,061 --> 00:45:34,933
Yesterday was a nice day.

766
00:45:34,933 --> 00:45:39,137
Yeah, for everyone except my
mother.

767
00:45:39,137 --> 00:45:42,808
Why are you so hard on her?

768
00:45:42,808 --> 00:45:45,210
You didn't grow up with her.

769
00:45:45,210 --> 00:45:48,046
My mother threw me a party
when I got my first period.

770
00:45:48,046 --> 00:45:50,581
She invited all the relatives,
even the men.

771
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:54,552
Mortified.

772
00:45:54,552 --> 00:45:56,988
I'd be happy with mortified.

773
00:45:56,988 --> 00:45:58,223
At least I'd know that she was
invested in our lives.

774
00:45:58,223 --> 00:46:01,459
She's trying.

775
00:46:01,459 --> 00:46:03,094
( Door opens )

776
00:46:07,966 --> 00:46:12,637
Mrs. cleary, let me help you
with that.

777
00:46:12,637 --> 00:46:14,672
Oh, no, I've got it. It's fine.

778
00:46:14,672 --> 00:46:17,308
Okay, I should get going.

779
00:46:17,308 --> 00:46:19,744
Well, Angela, I wanted to show
you

780
00:46:19,744 --> 00:46:23,748
these freezer bags.

781
00:46:23,748 --> 00:46:25,716
You take a portion, and zip it
closed,

782
00:46:25,716 --> 00:46:28,653
and then, just put it in the
freezer.

783
00:46:28,653 --> 00:46:31,522
Okay.

784
00:46:31,522 --> 00:46:32,657
Yeah, like these.

785
00:46:32,657 --> 00:46:35,226
Wow. That's amazing.

786
00:46:35,226 --> 00:46:38,729
Well, that way, if I can't
come by for some reason,

787
00:46:38,729 --> 00:46:42,133
you and Shannon will have
plenty to eat.

788
00:46:42,133 --> 00:46:44,669
Well, thank you. That's great.

789
00:46:44,669 --> 00:46:47,638
It's convenient.

790
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:49,340
It meant a lot to the both of
us

791
00:46:51,109 --> 00:46:53,378
to have you at the wedding.

792
00:46:54,779 --> 00:46:55,513
Bye, baby.

793
00:46:56,882 --> 00:46:59,117
Bye.

794
00:47:05,390 --> 00:47:10,428
It's nice you're trying with
Angela.

795
00:47:13,798 --> 00:47:18,136
Are you feeling okay?

796
00:47:18,136 --> 00:47:19,670
I'm good. Ma, I'm good.

797
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:25,576
Today is the bishop's home
visit,

798
00:47:29,314 --> 00:47:32,083
so I won't be back this
afternoon.

799
00:47:32,083 --> 00:47:34,285
Do you want me to come?

800
00:47:36,487 --> 00:47:39,257
No. No, it's too far for you
to travel.

801
00:47:40,658 --> 00:47:41,792
Frank and Patty and your aunt
Mary will be there.

802
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:49,267
The perfect family.

803
00:47:50,735 --> 00:47:55,040
Good luck, ma.

804
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:56,441
Thank you, Shannon.

805
00:47:58,109 --> 00:47:59,410
Just stay calm.

806
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:14,092
* you've been far away from me
*

807
00:48:14,092 --> 00:48:16,761
* another land across the sea
*

808
00:48:16,761 --> 00:48:19,330
* and all this time, my heart
has been breakin' *

809
00:48:19,330 --> 00:48:21,832
* just waitin' round and
achin' for *

810
00:48:21,832 --> 00:48:24,269
* a letter or a telegram

811
00:48:24,269 --> 00:48:27,072
* tellin' me how sweet I am

812
00:48:27,072 --> 00:48:29,107
* you swear your heart will
never roam *

813
00:48:29,107 --> 00:48:31,276
* so till you come back home

814
00:48:31,276 --> 00:48:33,311
* I'll wear your colors, my
dear *

815
00:48:33,311 --> 00:48:35,813
* till you're standin' right
here *

816
00:48:35,813 --> 00:48:38,016
* next to the one who adores
you *

817
00:48:38,016 --> 00:48:41,119
* whose heart is beating for
you *

818
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:43,021
* like a lighthouse guides a
shipwrecked sailor... *

819
00:48:43,021 --> 00:48:45,656
would you take this junk and
hide it?

820
00:48:45,656 --> 00:48:48,026
They'll be here in two hours.

821
00:48:48,026 --> 00:48:49,694
There's nothing wrong with
being in a.A.

822
00:48:49,694 --> 00:48:51,396
I don't want the committee to
know you're an alcoholic.

823
00:48:51,396 --> 00:48:54,532
Eileen, I drank for 25 years.

824
00:48:54,532 --> 00:48:56,467
There is no one in this town
unaware that I'm an alcoholic.

825
00:48:56,467 --> 00:48:59,837
Are you crazy?

826
00:48:59,837 --> 00:49:02,740
* realize this love is strong
*

827
00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:04,475
* as it has been all along

828
00:49:04,475 --> 00:49:07,112
* for miles and miles can't
come between *

829
00:49:07,112 --> 00:49:08,913
* the kind of love we've seen
*

830
00:49:08,913 --> 00:49:10,648
( exhales loudly )

831
00:49:14,085 --> 00:49:14,685
Oh, don't touch. Don't touch
that.

832
00:49:17,622 --> 00:49:20,558
Where the hell is he?

833
00:49:20,558 --> 00:49:23,061
Patty will get him here.

834
00:49:23,061 --> 00:49:26,264
- ( Doorbell rings ) - Oh!

835
00:49:30,568 --> 00:49:35,140
Hi, mom. I'm home.

836
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:37,175
- Frank! - ( Frank Jr.
groaning )

837
00:49:37,175 --> 00:49:39,410
Jesus, Mary and Joseph!

838
00:49:41,546 --> 00:49:43,181
What are you doin' drunk in
the middle of the afternoon?

839
00:49:43,181 --> 00:49:45,783
Who cares what time he drinks?

840
00:49:45,783 --> 00:49:47,285
The bishop is gonna be here.

841
00:49:47,285 --> 00:49:48,753
What, they're not here yet?
Bishop!

842
00:49:48,753 --> 00:49:51,656
Frank, what are we gonna do?

843
00:49:51,656 --> 00:49:53,624
- Uh... bring him to the den.
- I am here

844
00:49:53,624 --> 00:49:56,327
oh, bishop! ( Laughs )

845
00:49:56,327 --> 00:49:57,962
- Put a sock in his mouth. -
Okay.

846
00:49:57,962 --> 00:49:59,064
Is my lezzie preggy sister
here?

847
00:49:59,064 --> 00:50:03,101
On your feet.

848
00:50:03,101 --> 00:50:04,402
One of the guys at the
firehouse told me

849
00:50:04,402 --> 00:50:06,571
those babies are called
Turkey-baster babies.

850
00:50:06,571 --> 00:50:08,339
- What? - ( All talking at
once )

851
00:50:08,339 --> 00:50:10,241
- ( Doorbell rings ) - Oh, my
god!

852
00:50:10,241 --> 00:50:12,077
- They're here. - ( All
exclaiming )

853
00:50:12,077 --> 00:50:15,046
- Turkey-baster babies. -
Yeah, it's funny.

854
00:50:15,046 --> 00:50:16,947
- ( Laughing ) Turkey
baster... - Yeah, yeah.

855
00:50:16,947 --> 00:50:19,384
- Whoa, whoa. - Gay-bies!

856
00:50:19,384 --> 00:50:22,853
Hey, when did you get here?

857
00:50:23,554 --> 00:50:24,722
Oh, god!

858
00:50:27,325 --> 00:50:28,759
Frank Jr. followed in his
father's footsteps.

859
00:50:28,759 --> 00:50:31,896
Both hero firemen.

860
00:50:31,896 --> 00:50:34,565
Thank you, monsignor.

861
00:50:34,565 --> 00:50:36,334
Frank got a medal of valor for
saving an entire family

862
00:50:37,034 --> 00:50:40,571
in an apartment fire.

863
00:50:40,571 --> 00:50:43,007
Mm, by the favor of the
heavens.

864
00:50:43,007 --> 00:50:45,443
We should do good deeds for
the glory of god, not to get
medals.

865
00:50:45,443 --> 00:50:47,878
He didn't save those people to
get medals, sister. It was his
job.

866
00:50:49,747 --> 00:50:50,915
Uh, would you like to see some
family pictures?

867
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:56,587
Oh, yes.

868
00:50:56,587 --> 00:50:58,589
This is frank Jr.'s wedding
picture.

869
00:50:58,589 --> 00:51:01,726
( Thudding sound, frank Jr.
groaning )

870
00:51:01,726 --> 00:51:03,128
What was that?

871
00:51:03,128 --> 00:51:04,429
The, uh... the plumbing.

872
00:51:04,429 --> 00:51:07,132
Isn't it lovely, your eminence?

873
00:51:07,132 --> 00:51:10,568
Yes. Is this your daughter?

874
00:51:10,568 --> 00:51:13,804
No. That's our son and his
wife.

875
00:51:15,206 --> 00:51:16,474
Where's your daughter's
wedding picture?

876
00:51:18,709 --> 00:51:21,612
There's no husband.

877
00:51:21,612 --> 00:51:24,849
No, but she's dating a very
nice young man,

878
00:51:24,849 --> 00:51:27,485
and we expect to hear that
they'll be married soon.

879
00:51:27,485 --> 00:51:31,489
Would you excuse me a moment?

880
00:51:31,489 --> 00:51:33,758
Well, what's the young man's
name?

881
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:36,294
Your eminence?

882
00:51:38,896 --> 00:51:41,332
The young man's name.

883
00:51:42,367 --> 00:51:43,534
What young man would that be?

884
00:51:46,304 --> 00:51:48,373
The young man your daughter is
about to marry.

885
00:51:48,373 --> 00:51:51,041
They're not officially engaged.

886
00:51:51,041 --> 00:51:53,978
Regardless, he has a name,
doesn't he?

887
00:51:53,978 --> 00:51:57,182
- Angelo. - Antonio.

888
00:51:57,182 --> 00:51:58,549
Angelo Antonio. He's one of
those people

889
00:51:58,549 --> 00:52:01,051
who has a first name for a
last name.

890
00:52:01,051 --> 00:52:04,522
Like my friend.

891
00:52:04,522 --> 00:52:05,823
She had the maiden name Riley,

892
00:52:05,823 --> 00:52:09,527
and she had a brother, John.

893
00:52:09,527 --> 00:52:11,028
Well, her daughter married a
man with the surname John.

894
00:52:11,028 --> 00:52:14,465
So she named her daughter
Riley.

895
00:52:14,465 --> 00:52:17,202
So she had a brother, John
Riley,

896
00:52:17,202 --> 00:52:19,337
and a granddaughter, Riley
John.

897
00:52:19,337 --> 00:52:22,707
( Weak chuckling )

898
00:52:24,809 --> 00:52:29,314
Oh! I think that went well.

899
00:52:29,314 --> 00:52:32,450
Bishop Donnelly is a good man.

900
00:52:32,450 --> 00:52:35,353
He seemed to focus on the
positive.

901
00:52:36,254 --> 00:52:37,121
What was positive?

902
00:52:39,790 --> 00:52:41,592
My work for the church.

903
00:52:43,328 --> 00:52:46,030
Our beautiful home.

904
00:52:48,299 --> 00:52:53,137
What are you doing?

905
00:52:54,104 --> 00:52:55,406
Where are you going?

906
00:52:57,775 --> 00:53:00,144
Do you remember when Shannon
was a baby,

907
00:53:00,144 --> 00:53:03,481
how people used to stop us in
the street?

908
00:53:03,481 --> 00:53:07,017
She had those blonde curls,

909
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:10,255
big, blue eyes.

910
00:53:10,255 --> 00:53:11,456
Why are you talking about this?

911
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:17,027
It's always the same word.

912
00:53:19,129 --> 00:53:22,533
She's... she's perfect.

913
00:53:24,168 --> 00:53:24,769
Not cute, not adorable.

914
00:53:26,337 --> 00:53:30,641
She's perfect.

915
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:31,842
Frank?

916
00:53:38,148 --> 00:53:42,987
I can't live like this anymore.

917
00:53:45,656 --> 00:53:49,560
Like what?

918
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:52,096
Well...

919
00:53:52,096 --> 00:53:55,300
We could start with the lying.

920
00:53:55,300 --> 00:53:56,967
Oh. What am I supposed to say?

921
00:53:56,967 --> 00:54:00,170
My daughter is a lesbian,

922
00:54:00,170 --> 00:54:01,639
and is having a Turkey-baster
baby?

923
00:54:01,639 --> 00:54:04,475
I'm not just talking about
today, Eileen.

924
00:54:04,475 --> 00:54:06,944
Oh, I don't think you want to
talk about the past, frank.

925
00:54:06,944 --> 00:54:08,746
I'm sober now.

926
00:54:11,148 --> 00:54:13,518
Things could be very different
for us,

927
00:54:13,518 --> 00:54:16,421
but no. See, you're stuck.
Stuck in the way it was.

928
00:54:16,421 --> 00:54:19,524
Oh, let me tell you about the
way it was, frank.

929
00:54:19,524 --> 00:54:22,327
I put up with your crap for 20
years.

930
00:54:22,327 --> 00:54:25,463
I held this family together on
my own,

931
00:54:25,463 --> 00:54:28,699
and I never once considered
leaving you.

932
00:54:30,601 --> 00:54:31,068
Maybe you should have.

933
00:54:55,626 --> 00:55:00,731
* there was a house halfway
around the world *

934
00:55:00,731 --> 00:55:03,033
* and I was invited in for a
small taste of gin *

935
00:55:03,033 --> 00:55:06,971
yes, could I...

936
00:55:06,971 --> 00:55:08,939
Please speak with, uh, father
Joe MacDonald?

937
00:55:08,939 --> 00:55:11,275
* cage too small

938
00:55:11,275 --> 00:55:14,244
uh, yes.

939
00:55:14,244 --> 00:55:16,213
* I asked the caretaker 'cause
he was the maker *

940
00:55:16,213 --> 00:55:18,583
* looked at me and laughed

941
00:55:18,583 --> 00:55:20,385
* took another sip from his
glass *

942
00:55:20,385 --> 00:55:21,952
* he said, open up your ears
and heart *

943
00:55:21,952 --> 00:55:24,455
* you put a big bird in a
small cage *

944
00:55:24,455 --> 00:55:27,157
* and it'll sing you a song

945
00:55:28,393 --> 00:55:28,993
* that we all love to sing
along *

946
00:55:33,831 --> 00:55:38,569
Mrs. cleary?

947
00:55:38,569 --> 00:55:40,771
* to the sound of the bird
that mourns *

948
00:55:56,487 --> 00:56:01,225
* put a big bird in a small
cage *

949
00:56:01,225 --> 00:56:03,628
* and it'll sing you a song

950
00:56:03,628 --> 00:56:05,630
* you put a big bird in a
small cage *

951
00:56:07,798 --> 00:56:10,801
* and it will sing you a song
*

952
00:56:11,769 --> 00:56:12,837
before we discuss our luncheon,

953
00:56:16,907 --> 00:56:18,443
Agnes Dunn would like to
update us on the petition drive

954
00:56:18,443 --> 00:56:21,512
to stop gay adoption.

955
00:56:21,512 --> 00:56:22,346
Who's adopting gay people?

956
00:56:25,115 --> 00:56:28,352
No one is, Greta.

957
00:56:28,352 --> 00:56:29,454
It's the gays that are trying
to indoctrinate our children.

958
00:56:29,454 --> 00:56:32,723
Nun: Mm, yes.

959
00:56:32,723 --> 00:56:34,459
The law currently states that
gays can adopt children.

960
00:56:34,459 --> 00:56:38,463
But we are working with the
catholic league

961
00:56:38,463 --> 00:56:40,531
of religious and civil rights

962
00:56:40,531 --> 00:56:43,233
to gather signatures to put

963
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:45,035
a "protect our children"
initiative

964
00:56:45,035 --> 00:56:47,605
on November's ballot.

965
00:56:47,605 --> 00:56:50,174
Is this really where we should
be focusing our energy?

966
00:56:50,174 --> 00:56:52,309
Well, we know where you stand,
miss "i have a gay big brother."

967
00:56:52,309 --> 00:56:56,681
Yes, I have a gay brother

968
00:56:56,681 --> 00:56:58,816
and I am going to start the
petition,

969
00:56:58,816 --> 00:57:01,986
and once we all have signed it,

970
00:57:01,986 --> 00:57:03,821
we will then circulate it
among the congregation.

971
00:57:03,821 --> 00:57:07,725
Well, then, let us move on

972
00:57:07,725 --> 00:57:09,860
to our catholic woman of the
year luncheon.

973
00:57:09,860 --> 00:57:12,096
As you all know, both Agnes
Dunn and Eileen cleary

974
00:57:12,096 --> 00:57:15,600
have been nominated.

975
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:18,836
However, there's only one
honored,

976
00:57:18,836 --> 00:57:21,371
and to receive sacramental
absolution

977
00:57:21,371 --> 00:57:24,108
from the sacred heart of Jesus.

978
00:57:24,108 --> 00:57:26,644
To quote Matthew 22:14,

979
00:57:26,644 --> 00:57:29,514
"many are called,

980
00:57:29,514 --> 00:57:30,681
but few are chosen."

981
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:07,918
Wonderful. Wonderful.

982
00:58:18,162 --> 00:58:22,867
- Oh, what are you doing? -
Ma, it's okay.

983
00:58:22,867 --> 00:58:25,703
You can't handle anything
toxic.

984
00:58:25,703 --> 00:58:28,172
It's a green product. It's
non-toxic.

985
00:58:32,977 --> 00:58:37,915
Why didn't you tell me daddy
left home?

986
00:58:37,915 --> 00:58:39,984
We had a little fight. He'll
be home soon.

987
00:58:44,622 --> 00:58:45,823
But he's never left you before.

988
00:58:47,424 --> 00:58:49,326
Shannon, everything is all
right.

989
00:58:49,326 --> 00:58:51,161
- Ma. - Nothing is wrong.

990
00:58:59,269 --> 00:59:03,908
You're working too hard.

991
00:59:03,908 --> 00:59:06,911
We've gotta pay for the baby,
ma.

992
00:59:06,911 --> 00:59:10,280
This baby is yours. No one can
take it away from you.

993
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:14,518
What are you talking about?

994
00:59:14,518 --> 00:59:17,121
Just that I'm glad you're
having the baby.

995
00:59:17,121 --> 00:59:19,957
It's yours. No one can dispute
that.

996
00:59:22,259 --> 00:59:23,260
No, this baby is mine and
Angela's. We planned it
together.

997
00:59:26,797 --> 00:59:28,799
Well, I know that, but some
people don't understand.

998
00:59:33,337 --> 00:59:35,773
Some people.

999
00:59:35,773 --> 00:59:37,507
Who doesn't understand, ma?

1000
00:59:40,778 --> 00:59:43,748
Some people at the church have
started a petition

1001
00:59:43,748 --> 00:59:46,651
against gay adoption.

1002
00:59:46,651 --> 00:59:49,386
Okay.

1003
00:59:49,386 --> 00:59:51,656
Most people think that a baby

1004
00:59:51,656 --> 00:59:54,859
needs a mother and a father.

1005
00:59:54,859 --> 00:59:57,327
Just because you've chosen an
alternative lifestyle

1006
00:59:57,327 --> 01:00:00,765
doesn't mean people accept it.

1007
01:00:00,765 --> 01:00:04,268
I don't care what those people
think.

1008
01:00:04,268 --> 01:00:07,337
I signed it.

1009
01:00:08,238 --> 01:00:08,906
You signed the petition?

1010
01:00:14,812 --> 01:00:18,749
How could you do that?

1011
01:00:18,749 --> 01:00:20,985
What if I don't agree with
your lifestyle?

1012
01:00:20,985 --> 01:00:23,320
You just assume I'll accept it.

1013
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:25,856
- What about accepting me? - I
don't petition against you.

1014
01:00:25,856 --> 01:00:29,593
That was Agnes Dunn's idea,
not mine.

1015
01:00:29,593 --> 01:00:32,229
But you signed it. You signed
it.

1016
01:00:32,229 --> 01:00:34,098
What is it about my life that
you find so reprehensible?

1017
01:00:34,098 --> 01:00:37,601
- You're living in sin. - Says
who?

1018
01:00:37,601 --> 01:00:39,970
The pope.

1019
01:00:39,970 --> 01:00:41,605
Well, what do you think?

1020
01:00:41,605 --> 01:00:43,841
I don't have to think. I'm a
catholic.

1021
01:00:47,712 --> 01:00:51,481
I don't know why I'm still
surprised by you.

1022
01:00:51,481 --> 01:00:54,651
I raised you in the church.

1023
01:00:54,651 --> 01:00:57,054
Why don't you understand?

1024
01:00:57,054 --> 01:01:00,090
I do.

1025
01:01:00,090 --> 01:01:03,193
Damn it.

1026
01:01:03,193 --> 01:01:07,231
I do.

1027
01:01:12,402 --> 01:01:17,241
That's why you have to leave.

1028
01:01:20,044 --> 01:01:25,082
I don't want my baby around
you.

1029
01:01:56,847 --> 01:02:01,618
* look out the window

1030
01:02:01,618 --> 01:02:04,454
* it's all horizons and halos
*

1031
01:02:06,323 --> 01:02:08,158
* holding a moment

1032
01:02:11,061 --> 01:02:13,430
* healing the scars so they
don't show *

1033
01:02:14,999 --> 01:02:16,700
* someone say something to
crush all the noise *

1034
01:02:19,569 --> 01:02:24,041
* that surrounds us

1035
01:02:25,042 --> 01:02:26,443
* if I catch a bullet

1036
01:02:29,013 --> 01:02:31,949
*then maybe we can make it
through this *

1037
01:02:39,156 --> 01:02:43,994
- oh... - Ah, Mrs. cleary.

1038
01:02:43,994 --> 01:02:46,263
Thank you so much for meeting
me here.

1039
01:02:46,263 --> 01:02:47,832
- I'll see you next week. -
Oh, thank you.

1040
01:02:47,832 --> 01:02:49,466
Sorry for not introducing you.

1041
01:02:51,969 --> 01:02:53,904
Anonymity is the spiritual
foundation

1042
01:02:53,904 --> 01:02:55,873
of all our traditions.

1043
01:02:55,873 --> 01:02:57,674
Oh, I understand.

1044
01:02:57,674 --> 01:02:58,675
Can I get you anything?

1045
01:02:58,675 --> 01:03:01,078
No.

1046
01:03:01,078 --> 01:03:03,013
Why don't you hold these
meetings in your own church?

1047
01:03:03,013 --> 01:03:06,483
Oh, I don't lead these
meetings. I attend them.

1048
01:03:06,483 --> 01:03:08,352
There was a sense of urgency
in your message.

1049
01:03:11,188 --> 01:03:12,522
I asked my sponsor if I could
use the room to meet with you.

1050
01:03:12,522 --> 01:03:17,127
Glad you called.

1051
01:03:17,127 --> 01:03:18,295
I just meant because you
didn't show up the last time.

1052
01:03:18,295 --> 01:03:21,866
I'm sorry, father.

1053
01:03:21,866 --> 01:03:25,502
Uh, let's have a seat.

1054
01:03:28,738 --> 01:03:33,577
So, how can I help you?

1055
01:03:34,678 --> 01:03:35,379
I've made a lot of mistakes.

1056
01:03:38,282 --> 01:03:41,218
We all struggle from time to
time.

1057
01:03:41,218 --> 01:03:44,188
What if it's all the time?

1058
01:03:46,891 --> 01:03:49,994
I think you're being a little
hard on yourself.

1059
01:03:49,994 --> 01:03:53,197
No. I'm not.

1060
01:03:53,197 --> 01:03:54,431
Why don't you tell me why
you're here today?

1061
01:03:57,434 --> 01:03:59,403
I've been nominated for
catholic woman of the year.

1062
01:03:59,403 --> 01:04:02,706
The archbishop of Dublin is
flying over

1063
01:04:02,706 --> 01:04:06,911
to sanctify the winner with a
prayer of absolution.

1064
01:04:06,911 --> 01:04:11,148
That's a great honor.

1065
01:04:11,148 --> 01:04:13,650
I want it so badly.

1066
01:04:13,650 --> 01:04:15,552
I sacrificed my family for it.

1067
01:04:17,321 --> 01:04:18,555
You think the church wouldn't
approve of them.

1068
01:04:20,624 --> 01:04:25,295
Do you?

1069
01:04:26,263 --> 01:04:27,431
Mrs. cleary, I think that,
uh...

1070
01:04:30,100 --> 01:04:33,370
God sits at the head of your
family,

1071
01:04:33,370 --> 01:04:34,804
and the only real obligation
you have is just to be one unit,

1072
01:04:34,804 --> 01:04:39,576
united in love.

1073
01:04:41,411 --> 01:04:42,112
I've been going to church my
whole life,

1074
01:04:45,215 --> 01:04:48,452
and I've never heard anybody
like you.

1075
01:04:52,356 --> 01:04:56,994
( Door opens )

1076
01:04:56,994 --> 01:04:58,195
- Frank. - Dad asked me to
wait for you.

1077
01:05:00,297 --> 01:05:02,699
Shannon was rushed to the
hospital.

1078
01:05:05,135 --> 01:05:10,174
( Monitor beeping )

1079
01:05:11,341 --> 01:05:11,608
Shannon.

1080
01:05:18,115 --> 01:05:23,153
* I've been finding puzzle
pces of us *

1081
01:05:23,853 --> 01:05:27,757
* kept in the dust

1082
01:05:27,757 --> 01:05:30,327
* I've been hiding letters and
photograph frames *

1083
01:05:31,228 --> 01:05:35,232
* to forget your name

1084
01:05:35,232 --> 01:05:37,801
* we were never meant to be
this damn broken *

1085
01:05:40,270 --> 01:05:45,275
* words were never meant to be
this half-spoken *

1086
01:05:46,343 --> 01:05:51,281
Eileen, you left the front
door wide open.

1087
01:05:51,281 --> 01:05:54,884
* ...The space between the
universe *

1088
01:05:56,086 --> 01:05:59,856
I brought in your mail.

1089
01:05:59,856 --> 01:06:01,925
* and all we see has gone away
*

1090
01:06:04,594 --> 01:06:09,433
* gone away

1091
01:06:34,891 --> 01:06:39,263
I'm so sorry, Eileen.

1092
01:06:39,263 --> 01:06:40,797
We're gonna take a walk.

1093
01:06:42,632 --> 01:06:44,334
Shannon's in the bedroom.

1094
01:06:44,334 --> 01:06:45,869
Okay.

1095
01:06:59,516 --> 01:07:03,720
Shannon.

1096
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:06,256
I'm so sorry.

1097
01:07:10,727 --> 01:07:15,565
They let me hold her.

1098
01:07:16,633 --> 01:07:17,701
It was so quiet, except for
Angela crying.

1099
01:07:21,738 --> 01:07:23,407
Even a moment can be a gift.

1100
01:07:27,344 --> 01:07:28,278
Is that a god's will thing?

1101
01:07:31,014 --> 01:07:35,119
We don't know his reasons.

1102
01:07:35,119 --> 01:07:37,887
Really, ma. You don't think
he's punishing me for having
this child with another woman?

1103
01:07:37,887 --> 01:07:42,326
Shannon, you are going to be a
wonderful mother.

1104
01:07:42,326 --> 01:07:46,230
It just wasn't in god's plan
right now.

1105
01:07:46,230 --> 01:07:49,133
That's your answer for
everything.

1106
01:07:49,133 --> 01:07:51,135
Sometimes, these things just
happen.

1107
01:07:51,135 --> 01:07:54,971
To me. It happened to me.

1108
01:07:54,971 --> 01:07:59,042
Nothing I'm going through
could you possibly understand.

1109
01:08:00,510 --> 01:08:05,382
I do.

1110
01:08:05,382 --> 01:08:06,015
No, you never had to imagine
what you could've had.

1111
01:08:09,253 --> 01:08:11,388
You never had to imagine what
her first smile,

1112
01:08:11,388 --> 01:08:14,524
her first steps, her first
word would've been.

1113
01:08:16,426 --> 01:08:18,362
I have.

1114
01:08:22,166 --> 01:08:22,732
I had an abortion.

1115
01:08:27,171 --> 01:08:27,971
I don't understand.

1116
01:08:30,740 --> 01:08:33,343
I thought your father was
leaving us.

1117
01:08:33,343 --> 01:08:36,280
So all these years of spewing
all this crap,

1118
01:08:36,280 --> 01:08:39,983
of putting all this morality
on dad, on frank, on me.

1119
01:08:41,785 --> 01:08:44,388
It's not that simple.

1120
01:08:44,388 --> 01:08:45,989
How could you have an abortion?

1121
01:08:45,989 --> 01:08:49,025
I never worked.

1122
01:08:49,025 --> 01:08:51,094
I married your father in high
school.

1123
01:08:51,094 --> 01:08:52,762
I didn't even know how to
drive.

1124
01:08:52,762 --> 01:08:55,365
Your father came home,

1125
01:08:55,365 --> 01:08:57,534
and told me he was in love.

1126
01:08:58,435 --> 01:08:59,903
I had two small children.

1127
01:09:02,038 --> 01:09:03,573
What was I supposed to do?

1128
01:09:03,573 --> 01:09:07,644
I didn't want another child.

1129
01:09:07,644 --> 01:09:11,080
I couldn't have another baby
alone.

1130
01:09:13,617 --> 01:09:14,083
I wasn't alone. I just didn't
know that.

1131
01:09:22,859 --> 01:09:27,331
You just lacked faith.

1132
01:09:27,331 --> 01:09:28,565
So that's what I need to do,
right, mom?

1133
01:09:31,268 --> 01:09:34,471
Turn to god, and it will be
all right.

1134
01:09:35,605 --> 01:09:36,506
I don't know.

1135
01:09:38,908 --> 01:09:40,477
I don't know anymore.

1136
01:09:48,017 --> 01:09:52,856
Turn to me.

1137
01:09:59,763 --> 01:10:03,833
You're quiet today.

1138
01:10:03,833 --> 01:10:07,170
Am I?

1139
01:10:07,170 --> 01:10:09,138
You excited about the award?

1140
01:10:09,138 --> 01:10:11,408
Mrs. punch, I haven't won it
yet.

1141
01:10:11,408 --> 01:10:14,611
Well, you believe you deserve
it, don't you?

1142
01:10:15,279 --> 01:10:16,646
Mrs. punch.

1143
01:10:19,849 --> 01:10:21,217
I think you deserve it.

1144
01:10:21,217 --> 01:10:24,488
Why?

1145
01:10:24,488 --> 01:10:27,891
Because you show up,

1146
01:10:27,891 --> 01:10:29,726
every day like clockwork.

1147
01:10:29,726 --> 01:10:32,462
You're one to be counted on,
Mrs. cleary.

1148
01:10:32,462 --> 01:10:36,199
That's not an unremarkable
thing.

1149
01:10:43,273 --> 01:10:47,877
Ah, Mrs. cleary.

1150
01:10:47,877 --> 01:10:50,113
Always our most faithful.

1151
01:10:50,113 --> 01:10:53,683
I don't wish to disturb your
prayer,

1152
01:10:53,683 --> 01:10:55,352
but I wanted to know when I'd
be getting your family's
letters.

1153
01:10:55,352 --> 01:10:59,623
I'm sure they'll be arriving
soon.

1154
01:10:59,623 --> 01:11:02,426
The bishop was disappointed
the children were not able to
make the in-home visit.

1155
01:11:02,426 --> 01:11:06,062
The letters will be most
helpful.

1156
01:11:06,062 --> 01:11:09,733
Yes, monsignor.

1157
01:11:09,733 --> 01:11:11,335
And you should know that he
was most impressed

1158
01:11:11,335 --> 01:11:14,170
with your record of service.

1159
01:11:14,170 --> 01:11:15,772
And I assured him that your
family

1160
01:11:15,772 --> 01:11:18,408
is a model of honest, faithful
catholic values.

1161
01:11:18,408 --> 01:11:22,512
I'll leave you to your prayer.

1162
01:11:31,921 --> 01:11:36,926
Dear monsignor Murphy and
members of the committee:

1163
01:11:36,926 --> 01:11:41,765
I have been giving a lot of
thought

1164
01:11:41,765 --> 01:11:44,033
to what it means to win the
award,

1165
01:11:44,033 --> 01:11:46,436
to be recognized by the church,

1166
01:11:46,436 --> 01:11:48,171
and, of course, to be absolved
of my sins.

1167
01:11:48,171 --> 01:11:52,576
I realize now that, in order
to be truly forgiven,

1168
01:11:52,576 --> 01:11:56,980
we must first come to terms

1169
01:11:56,980 --> 01:11:59,549
with our choices,

1170
01:11:59,549 --> 01:12:01,284
no matter how difficult that
might be.

1171
01:12:05,021 --> 01:12:10,026
My efforts to repair things
begins now.

1172
01:12:11,595 --> 01:12:12,729
Before you make your decision,

1173
01:12:15,732 --> 01:12:17,300
there's some things I'd like
you to know

1174
01:12:17,300 --> 01:12:19,603
about my family.

1175
01:13:31,741 --> 01:13:35,979
Thanks for bringing me my
watch.

1176
01:13:35,979 --> 01:13:39,015
Mmm.

1177
01:13:39,015 --> 01:13:40,650
How's frank Jr. doing?

1178
01:13:40,650 --> 01:13:44,654
Working a lot of overtime.

1179
01:13:45,555 --> 01:13:46,389
Frank, what happened to us?

1180
01:13:51,628 --> 01:13:53,730
You married an alcoholic.

1181
01:13:58,968 --> 01:14:03,640
I had an abortion.

1182
01:14:03,640 --> 01:14:05,408
- It was when you were seeing
- I know.

1183
01:14:05,408 --> 01:14:08,878
You know?

1184
01:14:10,413 --> 01:14:11,280
You were hemorrhaging.

1185
01:14:13,650 --> 01:14:16,753
It was pretty bad.

1186
01:14:16,753 --> 01:14:18,254
The only way they could stop
the bleeding

1187
01:14:18,254 --> 01:14:21,357
was with a hysterectomy.

1188
01:14:21,357 --> 01:14:23,426
The doctors didn't wanna do it
without your husband's consent.

1189
01:14:24,928 --> 01:14:25,428
It took Mary six hours to find
me.

1190
01:14:30,199 --> 01:14:30,967
You almost bled to death.

1191
01:14:35,271 --> 01:14:35,905
That night was the first time
i tried to get sober.

1192
01:14:41,545 --> 01:14:42,846
Oh, frank.

1193
01:14:46,115 --> 01:14:47,350
It took me 15 years to forgive
myself.

1194
01:14:50,754 --> 01:14:52,355
Can you forgive me?

1195
01:14:55,224 --> 01:14:58,194
I never blamed you.

1196
01:14:58,962 --> 01:14:59,462
Uh-uh.

1197
01:15:02,966 --> 01:15:05,134
No.

1198
01:15:06,469 --> 01:15:11,207
I got a meeting to go to.

1199
01:15:15,211 --> 01:15:19,683
Can I go with you sometime?

1200
01:15:19,683 --> 01:15:22,919
( Sighs ) It's not really...

1201
01:15:25,321 --> 01:15:30,059
Sure.

1202
01:15:31,227 --> 01:15:31,460
Well, this is highly unusual.

1203
01:15:35,198 --> 01:15:39,102
I have glowing recommendations
from frank and the children.

1204
01:15:39,102 --> 01:15:42,706
Yes, but you also have a
letter written by Mrs. cleary
herself.

1205
01:15:42,706 --> 01:15:46,610
I think the immodesty of the
family confessions in her
letter is

1206
01:15:46,610 --> 01:15:51,214
refreshing.

1207
01:16:00,790 --> 01:16:05,662
* somehow

1208
01:16:05,662 --> 01:16:06,763
* I'm leading someone else's
life *

1209
01:16:10,734 --> 01:16:14,771
* I cut her star down

1210
01:16:16,305 --> 01:16:16,806
* with my knife

1211
01:16:20,176 --> 01:16:20,409
* and right now

1212
01:16:23,813 --> 01:16:25,214
* I still see the way the moon
*

1213
01:16:30,186 --> 01:16:31,487
* plays this tune

1214
01:16:34,658 --> 01:16:37,426
* though our lights died

1215
01:16:40,730 --> 01:16:44,233
* my hands shake

1216
01:16:44,233 --> 01:16:46,002
* my knees quake

1217
01:16:49,739 --> 01:16:50,406
* it's every day

1218
01:16:53,209 --> 01:16:54,878
* the same way

1219
01:16:57,513 --> 01:17:00,483
* 'cause then came you

1220
01:17:02,351 --> 01:17:06,723
Mrs. cleary.

1221
01:17:06,723 --> 01:17:08,758
What are you doing here?

1222
01:17:08,758 --> 01:17:10,827
Well, I just thought I'd get
an early start,

1223
01:17:10,827 --> 01:17:14,798
you know, on account of the
luncheon.

1224
01:17:14,798 --> 01:17:17,701
Don't you remember?

1225
01:17:17,701 --> 01:17:19,302
You arranged with Mrs.
O'Donnell to deliver your meals
today,

1226
01:17:19,302 --> 01:17:20,603
on account of the luncheon.

1227
01:17:20,603 --> 01:17:23,606
Oh, I'm...

1228
01:17:23,606 --> 01:17:25,341
I'm glad you're here.

1229
01:17:25,341 --> 01:17:27,944
Come here.

1230
01:17:27,944 --> 01:17:29,713
I'm rooting for you, Mrs.
cleary.

1231
01:17:29,713 --> 01:17:31,715
I am preparing a special meal
for the occasion.

1232
01:17:31,715 --> 01:17:34,350
Pollo con crema, my mother's
recipe.

1233
01:17:34,350 --> 01:17:36,786
I prepared it this weekend for
my family,

1234
01:17:36,786 --> 01:17:39,022
just so I wouldn't be so rusty.

1235
01:17:39,022 --> 01:17:41,290
Oh, you have a beautiful
family.

1236
01:17:41,290 --> 01:17:44,460
Thank you.

1237
01:17:44,460 --> 01:17:45,729
I'm looking forward to meeting
your family today.

1238
01:17:45,729 --> 01:17:49,598
Aah!

1239
01:17:49,598 --> 01:17:53,002
( People talking quietly )

1240
01:18:02,511 --> 01:18:06,983
You hardly said a word to him.

1241
01:18:06,983 --> 01:18:10,319
- Who? - The archbishop.

1242
01:18:10,319 --> 01:18:12,655
Agnes Dunn's been circling
them all morning like a shark.

1243
01:18:24,768 --> 01:18:29,538
Can we all take our seats,
please?

1244
01:18:30,573 --> 01:18:31,107
They're not coming.

1245
01:18:35,044 --> 01:18:37,480
What are you talking about?

1246
01:18:37,480 --> 01:18:39,148
Try to enjoy yourself.

1247
01:18:39,148 --> 01:18:41,117
Welcome to a very special
commemoration

1248
01:18:41,117 --> 01:18:44,420
of what it means to be a
catholic woman.

1249
01:18:44,420 --> 01:18:46,990
We are exalted by the presence

1250
01:18:46,990 --> 01:18:49,225
of the archbishop of Dublin.

1251
01:18:49,225 --> 01:18:51,560
( Applause )

1252
01:18:59,869 --> 01:19:05,041
This year, we are particularly
blessed

1253
01:19:05,041 --> 01:19:08,044
to be honoring someone who
continually commits herself

1254
01:19:08,044 --> 01:19:11,114
to all manner of pastoral good
works in our community.

1255
01:19:11,114 --> 01:19:14,317
But community service alone
would not be enough.

1256
01:19:15,718 --> 01:19:17,987
We are lucky to have in our
parish

1257
01:19:20,456 --> 01:19:23,026
a woman who embodies both
faith and family.

1258
01:19:23,026 --> 01:19:26,896
She has been part of our
community for many years,

1259
01:19:26,896 --> 01:19:29,833
and in some ways, is our
community.

1260
01:19:29,833 --> 01:19:33,102
Her dedication and devotion
mirrors...

1261
01:19:33,102 --> 01:19:35,839
What are we doing here?

1262
01:19:35,839 --> 01:19:38,374
You're being honored.

1263
01:19:38,374 --> 01:19:39,742
Who cares?

1264
01:19:41,444 --> 01:19:44,313
Eileen?

1265
01:21:23,446 --> 01:21:28,284

1266
01:21:39,228 --> 01:21:43,866
*

1267
01:21:57,313 --> 01:22:02,151
*

1268
01:22:11,260 --> 01:22:15,898
*

1269
01:22:27,276 --> 01:22:31,914
*

1270
01:22:49,298 --> 01:22:53,936
*

1271
01:23:14,323 --> 01:23:18,961
