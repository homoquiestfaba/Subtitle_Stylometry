1
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:04,837
- Mom, just being here
with you like this,

2
00:00:04,838 --> 00:00:06,505
I feel better already.

3
00:00:06,506 --> 00:00:08,675
- Ooh, what I would
have given to hear that

4
00:00:08,676 --> 00:00:10,384
from you when you were 16!

5
00:00:10,385 --> 00:00:12,720
- Well, you handled the
troubled teen pretty well.

6
00:00:12,721 --> 00:00:14,764
- Oooh, maybe it
looked that way.

7
00:00:14,765 --> 00:00:18,392
I just remember it
as controlled panic.

8
00:00:18,393 --> 00:00:19,686
- I don't know.

9
00:00:19,687 --> 00:00:21,688
It, maybe that's why I
had to see you today.

10
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:24,315
I mean, maybe that troubled
teen is not far off.

11
00:00:24,316 --> 00:00:25,482
- What's the matter?

12
00:00:25,483 --> 00:00:26,318
- Nothing.

13
00:00:28,904 --> 00:00:30,197
It's complicated.

14
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:34,201
- A man?

15
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:37,537
- No, it's more than
just a guy problem.

16
00:00:38,706 --> 00:00:40,583
It's connected on
so many levels.

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,835
I don't know how to get out.

18
00:00:43,836 --> 00:00:45,920
- Heather, what's going on?

19
00:00:45,921 --> 00:00:48,089
- Can we go for a
coffee or something?

20
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:49,381
- Mmm.

21
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:51,093
- Let's just go
and try Rolanda's.

22
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:54,887
(tires screeching)

23
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:55,930
(screams)

24
00:00:55,931 --> 00:00:58,642
(dramatic music)

25
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:03,562
- Oh, my God!

26
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:05,733
Somebody, help me, please!

27
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:09,401
Please, help me!

28
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:11,946

- Jerry, you heard
me the first time.

47
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:15,487
7th Avenue and 23rd
for under 1.2 mil.

48
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:20,241
Two bedrooms, two
baths, 1700 square feet.

49
00:03:20,242 --> 00:03:22,535
Taxes and maintenance
are under 20 a year.

50
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:24,746
Jerry?

51
00:03:24,747 --> 00:03:26,663
Jerry, this is not a
deal you think about.

52
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:29,292
This is a deal you pounce
on and grab with two hands.

53
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:32,128
By the time this listing
gets to the street,

54
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:34,339
somebody else will
already be moving in.

55
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:40,678
Okay, I'll set up
a viewing at 11.

56
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:42,722
Bring your checkbook.

57
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:48,144
All right, I think I've
got a taker on 2527.

58
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:49,395
- What took you so long?

59
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:51,397
You've had that listing
for a whole 45 minutes.

60
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:53,565
- Oh, well, you're
right, I'm slipping.

61
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:54,942
- Well, before you
slip any further,

62
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:56,444
I have another listing for you.

63
00:03:57,445 --> 00:03:58,863
A gift.

64
00:03:58,864 --> 00:04:00,489
- Oh, I've heard that before.

65
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,908
- No, seriously.

66
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:04,577
How does a two-bedroom apartment
at 107 East 70th sound?

67
00:04:05,703 --> 00:04:07,538
- Like I've already
made the sale.

68
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:09,791
- The woman selling is
named Chantal Greco.

69
00:04:09,792 --> 00:04:12,877
The apartment is owned
by her daughter, Heather.

70
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:14,336
- The actress?

71
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:15,587
Who was killed in
the hit-and-run?

72
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:16,423
- Mm-hmm.

73
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:21,052
- I saw her in "The Tea Room,"

74
00:04:21,053 --> 00:04:22,887
on Broadway last year.

75
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:24,638
She was really great.

76
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:25,639
- The mom says she wants
to sell the apartment

77
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,266
as soon as possible.

78
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:30,269
So she'll be there for
the next couple of hours.

79
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,104
- I'm on my way.

80
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,773
I'll check in after
the inspection.

81
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:37,776
And, Rick, thanks.

82
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:39,236
- Yeah.

83
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:40,906
For the queen of Manhattan
real estate, anything.

84
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:45,035
(car horn honking)

85
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:47,495
- Thanks.

86
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:51,332
- Ms. Farrell, back again.

87
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:53,835
Not content until you sell
every apartment in the building?

88
00:04:53,836 --> 00:04:55,628
- It's all part
of the plan, Tim.

89
00:04:56,504 --> 00:04:58,630
I'm here to see Chantal Greco.

90
00:04:58,631 --> 00:04:59,798
She's thinking of selling.

91
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:01,175
- Yeah, Penthouse Six.

92
00:05:01,176 --> 00:05:03,260
Nice woman, Mrs. Greco.

93
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:04,971
Pity what happened
to her daughter.

94
00:05:04,972 --> 00:05:06,472
I hope you can help her out.

95
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:07,473
- Me, too.

96
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:08,308
Thanks.

97
00:05:12,354 --> 00:05:13,312
- [Mrs. Greco]
Thank you for coming

98
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,647
by so quickly, Ms. Farrell.

99
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:17,067
- No problem.

100
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:19,152
I'm happy to help.

101
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:23,364
It's a beautiful apartment.

102
00:05:23,365 --> 00:05:24,824
It's a shame you have to sell.

103
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:30,662
- I didn't really want to.

104
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:32,958
It's more my ex-husband's idea.

105
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:36,962
He thinks I'm obsessing
on our daughter's death.

106
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:41,341
He thinks selling the apartment
will be healthier for me.

107
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:45,177
He thinks it'll help me forget.

108
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:46,845
- I know it's something
you'll never forget,

109
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:49,892
but sometimes it is
better to try to move on.

110
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:52,185
- Maybe.

111
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:55,855
If it had been an accident.

112
00:05:57,024 --> 00:05:59,233
But the truth of it is
my daughter was murdered

113
00:05:59,234 --> 00:06:01,402
right in front of my very eyes.

114
00:06:01,403 --> 00:06:02,904
(dramatic orchestral music)

115
00:06:02,905 --> 00:06:04,239
How do I move on from that?

116
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:06,407
- I'm sorry.

117
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:07,699
I didn't know.

118
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:08,535
- You wouldn't.

119
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:12,246
Nobody believes them
when I tell them.

120
00:06:12,247 --> 00:06:14,999
Not the police, not
Heather's father.

121
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,250
Nobody.

122
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:18,252
- How can you be so sure?

123
00:06:18,253 --> 00:06:21,630
- He came up onto the
sidewalk right at us.

124
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:22,714
He wasn't out of control.

125
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:24,716
He knew what he was doing.

126
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:26,010
- But why?

127
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:27,262
- I don't know.

128
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:34,893
But something was
going on with Heather.

129
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:36,188
Something that scared her.

130
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:39,732
She was going to
tell me that day.

131
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:43,028
She never got the chance.

132
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:47,698
I found her journal
this morning.

133
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:48,907
And I've been reading it,

134
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:50,660
trying to make some
sense of it all.

135
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:52,786
When I told Jimmy about it,

136
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:54,497
he said I should
burn the journal.

137
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:56,791
Along with everything else.

138
00:07:00,087 --> 00:07:01,421
You think I'm crazy, too.

139
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:04,049
- No, I don't
think you're crazy.

140
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:07,970
But I don't know how you'd
ever prove what you believe.

141
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,015
- Maybe Jimmy's right.

142
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,352
Maybe it's best I
sell this place.

143
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:18,396
- [Lacey] Well, there's
something I can help you with.

144
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:29,281
(car horn beeps)

145
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:30,117
- Hi!

146
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:33,660
Aunt Lacey's here!

147
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:34,997
- [Lacey] Hello!

148
00:07:36,123 --> 00:07:37,456
- Aunt Lacey!

149
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:38,290
- Oh!

150
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,167
(laughs)

151
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:42,836
- I missed you so
much last weekend!

152
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:45,006
You didn't come for dinner!

153
00:07:45,007 --> 00:07:46,965
- I know, I was stuck at work.

154
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:48,884
- You're always working.

155
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:50,969
- Well, it sure feels
that way, doesn't it?

156
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,223
But I'm here now, so
let's go find your mom.

157
00:07:54,391 --> 00:07:56,225
Kit, you should have
seen this poor woman.

158
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:57,644
She was so broken up.

159
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:00,937
Like Mom after Dad died.

160
00:08:00,938 --> 00:08:02,023
- Poor thing.

161
00:08:02,024 --> 00:08:02,815
- Poor thing?

162
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:06,694
Do you know who
her ex-husband is?

163
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:08,988
Jimmy Greco.

164
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:11,823
Owns the Venezia
Restaurant downtown

165
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:13,034
and he's halfway home to getting

166
00:08:13,035 --> 00:08:15,037
his own casino license
in Atlantic City.

167
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,664
I mean, these people
could buy and sell us.

168
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:21,167
- Not everything's
about money, Jay.

169
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:22,918
- That's what people
who have money say.

170
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:24,961
- She lost her daughter.

171
00:08:24,962 --> 00:08:26,547
- Oh, and because we
feel sorry for her,

172
00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:28,507
you're going to give
her back your fees?

173
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:32,303
(dramatic orchestral music)

174
00:08:32,304 --> 00:08:34,139
Money, money, money.

175
00:08:39,561 --> 00:08:40,852
- I'm so sorry about Jay.

176
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:42,688
Ever since his
business went off--

177
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:43,897
- It's okay.

178
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:45,149
I know.

179
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,067
Listen, I'll call you tomorrow.

180
00:08:46,068 --> 00:08:47,526
- Okay.

181
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:50,028
- You aren't going to leave
without saying good-bye?

182
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:52,198
- Not on your life, kiddo.

183
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:54,241
As a matter of fact,
if mom doesn't mind,

184
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:55,867
I was going to come
up and tuck you in.

185
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:57,161
- Be careful she
doesn't rope you

186
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:59,330
into reading a bedtime story.

187
00:08:59,331 --> 00:09:02,167
- I'll take my chances,
come on, hop on.

188
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:05,294
- Giddy-up!

189
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:06,671
Just one story!

190
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:08,798
Good night!

191
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:12,219
(chuckling)

192
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:21,394
(phone ringing)

193
00:09:23,438 --> 00:09:25,063
- Hi, this is Lacey.

194
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:27,566
- Chantal Greco says
you got along great.

195
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,776
Says you filled her
with confidence.

196
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:31,445
- All part of the service.

197
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:34,448
- Listen, I've got
some more good news.

198
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:36,659
I got a call from Keller,
Roland and Smythe.

199
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:39,661
They've got an executive
being relocated to the city.

200
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:42,206
He needs to find
a place real fast.

201
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:44,167
The Greco apartment
fits his wish list,

202
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:47,586
and price seems to be no object.

203
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,630
- Great, do you have a name?

204
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:51,215
- [Ryan] Curtis Caldwell.

205
00:09:51,216 --> 00:09:53,885
He's already set up to meet
you there at 10 tomorrow.

206
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,599
- A lot of people are
apprehensive about
moving to New York,

207
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,727
but it's really not
as scary as it seems.

208
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:17,116
- This is nice.

209
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:18,951
Lots of space.

210
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:21,913
My wife would love it.

211
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:28,084
What's the asking on this?

212
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:30,421
- Well, they're asking 950,

213
00:10:30,422 --> 00:10:31,588
but they're looking to sell,

214
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:33,465
so I think if you offer
anything over 900,

215
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,259
you might have a deal.

216
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:37,179
And just wait until
you see the bedroom.

217
00:10:45,102 --> 00:10:45,937
- [Chantal] Lacey?

218
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:51,693
- Chantal?

219
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,986
I didn't realize you were here.

220
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:57,239
- My God, Lacey, she
really was in trouble!

221
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,657
(suspenseful orchestral music)

222
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:01,243
- I'll bring back my
client another time.

223
00:11:01,244 --> 00:11:03,704
- No, I think I've
changed my mind.

224
00:11:03,705 --> 00:11:04,664
I'm not selling.

225
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:13,589
- I'm sorry, did you hear?

226
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:14,715
I don't know what to say.

227
00:11:14,716 --> 00:11:16,175
- It's a little confusing.

228
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:19,511
- I'll try and get
her to reconsider.

229
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:20,762
- That'd be great.

230
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:22,390
It's exactly what
I'm looking for.

231
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:30,231
- Now, this is something
I never thought I'd see.

232
00:11:30,232 --> 00:11:32,900
Lacey Farrell talking
about giving up a sale.

233
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:37,738
- I don't know.

234
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:39,030
Maybe Chantal really isn't ready

235
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:40,782
to give up her memories
of her daughter.

236
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:43,994
Or maybe there really was
more to Heather's death.

237
00:11:43,995 --> 00:11:45,287
- Oh no, not you, too.

238
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:47,373
- You should have seen
her with that journal.

239
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:49,124
It was as if she was
getting confirmation

240
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,167
of everything she believed.

241
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:53,462
- Lacey, you're
not a psychologist.

242
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:55,046
You're a real estate agent.

243
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:56,923
- Hey, you should know
that sometimes in this job

244
00:11:56,924 --> 00:11:58,884
you have to be
part psychologist.

245
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:00,594
(phone rings)

246
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:03,096
All right, don't worry.

247
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:05,056
I won't get too involved.

248
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:06,267
- [Rick] Good.

249
00:12:06,268 --> 00:12:07,269
Now go and make that sale.

250
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:11,731
(phones ring)

251
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,243
(taps phone keypad)

252
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:28,914
(phone ringing)

253
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:29,831
- [Chantal] Hello.

254
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:31,667
- Hello, Chantal, it's Lacey.

255
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:33,877
I was wondering if you would

256
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:36,254
reconsider selling
the apartment.

257
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:38,214
It's just that Mr.
Caldwell was really excited

258
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:39,383
when he saw the place, and--

259
00:12:39,384 --> 00:12:40,842
- I've found something
in the journal,

260
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:42,761
and it's finally
starting to make sense.

261
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:44,555
I'm sure Heather
was murdered now,

262
00:12:44,556 --> 00:12:46,765
and I don't know who to go to.

263
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:49,435
Lacey, I need help.

264
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:50,644
- Chantal, it's all right.

265
00:12:50,645 --> 00:12:51,937
Just sit tight.

266
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:53,440
I'll come by as
quickly as I can.

267
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:58,611
(phone clicks in receiver)

268
00:13:09,246 --> 00:13:10,997
- [Heather] Sometimes I
think he might just kill me

269
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:12,375
just to keep me quiet.

270
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:17,713
- Lacey?

271
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:21,300
(dramatic music crescendos)

272
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:28,223
(screams)

273
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:31,143
(muffled shooting)

274
00:13:36,608 --> 00:13:39,318
(footsteps echo)

275
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:04,511
(elevator bell rings)

276
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:22,903
- Chantal!

277
00:14:22,904 --> 00:14:23,987
Chantal.

278
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:25,407
Hold on, Chantal.

279
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:32,497
(suspenseful orchestral music)

280
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:42,380
Tell them to hurry, please.

281
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:43,215
- Journal.

282
00:14:45,176 --> 00:14:46,010
Take it.

283
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:48,012
Show Jimmy.

284
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:52,224
Nobody else.

285
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:55,520
Please, swear.

286
00:14:56,521 --> 00:14:58,188
- I swear, I swear.

287
00:14:58,189 --> 00:14:59,606
Okay, it's all right.

288
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:00,733
Just hold on.

289
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:03,986
Chantal?

290
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:09,450
(all chattering)

291
00:15:09,451 --> 00:15:12,119
(siren wailing)

292
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:17,415
Her ex-husband is Jimmy Greco.

293
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,292
He owns the Venezia Restaurant.

294
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:21,712
I don't know about
any other family.

295
00:15:21,713 --> 00:15:23,254
- And you said that the
last time you spoke to her,

296
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:24,631
she was very concerned.

297
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:26,424
- She said she
knew something more

298
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:28,343
about her daughter's death.

299
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:30,721
Or why.

300
00:15:30,722 --> 00:15:33,890
- So she suggested that this
fellow Caldwell was the killer.

301
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:36,309
- She didn't get a chance to
tell me who she suspected.

302
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:37,520
- What else did she say?

303
00:15:39,481 --> 00:15:41,106
- Nothing.

304
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:43,149
She said it was all
in Heather's journal.

305
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:45,694
I saw Caldwell run out with it.

306
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:48,279
- And you have no idea
what was in there?

307
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,948
- Could I have a glass of water?

308
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,950
I'm not feeling very well.

309
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:52,909
- Sure.

310
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:56,288
(mysterious music pulses)

311
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:06,548
(singing in foreign language)

312
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:10,010
- Mr. Counselor,
enjoying the pescadora?

313
00:16:10,011 --> 00:16:10,845
Good.

314
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:12,888
I'll be calling you.

315
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:13,723
- Good.

316
00:16:15,892 --> 00:16:18,351
- Mrs. Molinaro,
beautiful as always.

317
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:19,812
The boys are treating you good?

318
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:22,022
They're going to bring you

319
00:16:22,023 --> 00:16:23,439
a little something
special afterwards.

320
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,399
- Oh, how lovely.

321
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,402
- Jimmy, there's a call.

322
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:34,242
- Greco.

323
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:35,326
- Yeah, Mr. Greco.

324
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,120
I'm Detective Sloane.

325
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:38,371
Something's happened.

326
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:40,165
I'm afraid your wife's
been hurt pretty bad.

327
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:41,166
I'm gonna need you to come down

328
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:42,458
to your daughter's apartment.

329
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:43,418
- I'll be right down.

330
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:44,253
- Thank you.

331
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:52,011
(ominous orchestral music)

332
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:03,230
(glass shatters)

333
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:15,033
- It's pretty good.

334
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:17,704
I think the eyes
were further apart.

335
00:17:20,832 --> 00:17:24,752
(suspenseful orchestral music)

336
00:17:29,591 --> 00:17:31,675
Yeah, that's pretty good.

337
00:17:31,676 --> 00:17:34,469
- You were right, she knew.

338
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:35,721
I know.

339
00:17:35,722 --> 00:17:37,890
Listen, we've got
a few problems.

340
00:17:38,725 --> 00:17:39,892
The pages are missing.

341
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,979
You think I don't know that?

342
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:45,607
There's something else.

343
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:48,776
The real estate
woman, she saw me.

344
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:52,904
Stop worrying, will you?

345
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:53,739
I know what to do.

346
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:54,616
I'll take care of her.

347
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:57,993
It's my butt on the line.

348
00:17:57,994 --> 00:18:01,873
(suspenseful orchestral music)

349
00:18:04,876 --> 00:18:07,210
- Like I said, we
do a lot of business

350
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:09,337
with Keller, Roland and Smythe.

351
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:10,588
That's why I didn't question it

352
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:12,674
when the girl called to
make the appointment.

353
00:18:12,675 --> 00:18:14,635
- Right, well, we've
already called them,

354
00:18:14,636 --> 00:18:17,178
and they've never heard
of anybody named Caldwell.

355
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:18,930
And nobody from their office

356
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:21,099
has called you in the past week.

357
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,601
- I didn't dream
the call, detective.

358
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:26,271
Somebody knows we do
business with them.

359
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:28,815
- All right, well, if we
have any more questions,

360
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:30,441
I'll call you, Mr. Parker.

361
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:31,568
Thanks for coming down.

362
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:39,118
- Lacey, how're you doing?

363
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:42,078
- It's like it's not real.

364
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:44,165
It's like it's happening
to somebody else.

365
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:48,460
- Listen, if you need
anything, you call me, okay?

366
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:58,636
- Look, there's something
we're gonna have to deal with.

367
00:18:58,637 --> 00:18:59,805
This was not a robbery.

368
00:18:59,806 --> 00:19:00,765
This guy was a pro.

369
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:04,642
The only thing that screwed
it up was your arrival.

370
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:07,520
And you're the only one
who can ID the killer.

371
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:08,480
That worries me.

372
00:19:10,607 --> 00:19:12,483
- So what do I do now?

373
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:14,027
- I don't know.

374
00:19:14,028 --> 00:19:16,905
For the short term, I'm gonna
assign you some protection,

375
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:20,033
and hopefully we'll
be able to get him.

376
00:19:20,034 --> 00:19:20,993
- And if you can't?

377
00:19:22,453 --> 00:19:25,371
- Let's cross that bridge
when we come to it, okay?

378
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:26,622
See that she gets home,

379
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:28,624
and have them call
me when she arrives.

380
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:29,542
- Sure.

381
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:33,089
(dramatic orchestral music)

382
00:19:35,632 --> 00:19:38,844
- [Reporter] In a luxury
apartment at 107 East 70th--

383
00:19:38,845 --> 00:19:40,511
- Mom, Mom, come quick!

384
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:42,181
Aunt Lacey is on TV!

385
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:45,141
- [Reporter] Police would not
comment on her involvement

386
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:47,185
but say they are
interviewing a witness.

387
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:48,187
- Oh my God!

388
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:51,440
- [Reporter] Victim
Chantal Greco--

389
00:20:03,828 --> 00:20:06,330
(phone rings)

390
00:20:14,505 --> 00:20:15,421
- Kit?

391
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:16,547
- Honey, are you all right?

392
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:18,383
- I'm fine, I'm fine.

393
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:20,052
- I just saw you on TV.

394
00:20:21,888 --> 00:20:24,514
- I didn't see the news.

395
00:20:24,515 --> 00:20:26,391
- They said that
there was a witness.

396
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:28,726
Somebody who can
identify the killer.

397
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:30,896
Honey, were you
the one who saw it?

398
00:20:30,897 --> 00:20:32,522
- It was, it was me.

399
00:20:32,523 --> 00:20:33,940
- Oh, my God.

400
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:34,941
- You know, I'm fine.

401
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:36,360
I'm fine, really.

402
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:39,946
- I wanna come over, but
Jay's not here, and--

403
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:40,864
- Stay where you are.

404
00:20:40,865 --> 00:20:42,241
Really, I'm fine.

405
00:20:43,117 --> 00:20:44,742
Kiss Bonnie for me.

406
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:45,576
- I will.

407
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:46,412
Take care.

408
00:20:58,382 --> 00:21:01,177
(mysterious music)

409
00:21:13,189 --> 00:21:15,357
(gasping)

410
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:18,694
(water runs)

411
00:21:28,913 --> 00:21:30,832
(sobs)

412
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:03,322
(buttons beep)

413
00:22:07,076 --> 00:22:09,661
(copier whirs)

414
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:16,251
- [Steve] I'm very sorry.

415
00:22:16,252 --> 00:22:17,668
Mr. Greco isn't
seeing anyone today.

416
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:19,004
- I need to talk to him.

417
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:20,171
- I understand,
but I'm very sorry.

418
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:21,506
- [Lacey] It's about his wife.

419
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:25,510
(singing in foreign language)

420
00:22:25,511 --> 00:22:26,345
- Follow me.

421
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:34,811
One moment.

422
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:40,025
Jimmy, somebody here to
talk to you about Chantal.

423
00:22:40,026 --> 00:22:40,859
- Okay.

424
00:22:42,403 --> 00:22:43,237
- Please.

425
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:48,617
- Please take a seat.

426
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:53,579
What do you have
to tell me, Miss--

427
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,207
- Farrell, Lacey Farrell.

428
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:57,708
I'm a real estate agent.

429
00:22:57,709 --> 00:23:00,295
I was selling Heather's
apartment for Chantal.

430
00:23:00,296 --> 00:23:02,172
- I don't care about
the apartment right
now, Ms. Farrell.

431
00:23:02,173 --> 00:23:05,175
I thought this
was about Chantal.

432
00:23:05,176 --> 00:23:06,010
- It is.

433
00:23:07,678 --> 00:23:10,555
I was with her when she died,

434
00:23:10,556 --> 00:23:12,223
when she was killed.

435
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:13,975
She gave me a message.

436
00:23:13,976 --> 00:23:15,394
She said it was only for you.

437
00:23:27,281 --> 00:23:28,115
- Go on.

438
00:23:33,287 --> 00:23:34,495
- This is from
Heather's journal.

439
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:38,417
(suspenseful orchestral music)

440
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:45,881
Chantal said she'd found proof
that Heather was murdered.

441
00:23:45,882 --> 00:23:48,718
And that if you read that,
you'll know who did it.

442
00:23:48,719 --> 00:23:51,054
- There's a lot of stuff
that's blacked out here.

443
00:23:51,055 --> 00:23:52,138
- I'm sorry.

444
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:53,390
It's her blood.

445
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:59,480
Her last words to give
these pages to you.

446
00:24:01,482 --> 00:24:02,774
- I thought she was crazy.

447
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:08,780
But I guess I was the one who
wasn't seeing things clearly.

448
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:14,786
Thank you.

449
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:23,962
Steve, get a cab
for Ms. Farrell.

450
00:24:32,929 --> 00:24:34,973
And Steve, check her out.

451
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:57,746
(suspenseful music)

452
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:01,833
- Oh!

453
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:16,182
(gasps)

454
00:25:33,324 --> 00:25:36,327
(breathing heavily)

455
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:44,500
- [Sloane] I take these
things very seriously.

456
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:46,878
- I'm sorry that I
didn't tell you before.

457
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:50,632
But I promised her I'd
get them to her husband.

458
00:25:52,426 --> 00:25:54,427
- Yeah, well if there's
anything in these damn pages

459
00:25:54,428 --> 00:25:58,055
that's relevant to
Chantal Greco's murder,

460
00:25:58,056 --> 00:25:59,724
you might have just
provided our killer

461
00:25:59,725 --> 00:26:02,978
with some nice lead
time to disappear.

462
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:05,896
- I'm sorry.

463
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:07,064
I promised.

464
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:09,525
- You had no right
to keep that promise.

465
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:10,985
All right?

466
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:12,445
I don't know how it works
downtown, Ms. Farrell,

467
00:26:12,446 --> 00:26:14,364
but here, if you lie to me,

468
00:26:14,365 --> 00:26:16,073
the next real estate
you're gonna be looking at

469
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:17,701
is a door with bars on it.

470
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:20,078
Now, is there anything else?

471
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:24,457
- That's everything she gave me.

472
00:26:24,458 --> 00:26:25,292
- Sloane,

473
00:26:31,257 --> 00:26:32,757
you're not going
to believe this.

474
00:26:32,758 --> 00:26:33,966
- Try me.

475
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:35,092
- The guy who hit her
was wearing gloves,

476
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:36,428
but they must have ripped.

477
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:39,096
He left a clean
right index print

478
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:40,973
on the doorknob
of the apartment.

479
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:42,475
- And you got a match?

480
00:26:42,476 --> 00:26:43,685
- That's the wacky part.

481
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:47,689
The guy the print matches
has been dead for two years.

482
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:50,775
David Blake.

483
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:52,277
Contract hitter.

484
00:26:52,278 --> 00:26:54,487
Supposedly died in a boat
explosion two years ago.

485
00:26:54,488 --> 00:26:55,738
- Mm-hmm.

486
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:58,158
Maybe somebody died
in that explosion.

487
00:26:58,159 --> 00:26:59,451
But it wasn't David Blake.

488
00:27:03,164 --> 00:27:06,333
Is this the man who
killed Chantal Greco?

489
00:27:10,296 --> 00:27:11,921
- He's different.

490
00:27:11,922 --> 00:27:13,173
- Of course.

491
00:27:13,174 --> 00:27:14,340
He's had some work
done on his face,

492
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:15,592
right after he
faked his own death.

493
00:27:18,304 --> 00:27:22,433
Lacey, you are the only
person who can identify him.

494
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:26,811
Now, there'll be some changes
in your lifestyle for a while,

495
00:27:26,812 --> 00:27:31,148
but our highest priority
is going to be your safety.

496
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:34,820
(dramatic orchestral music)

497
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:03,806
- [Bonnie] Hey, Mom,
Aunt Lacey's here!

498
00:28:03,807 --> 00:28:05,099
- [Lacey] Hey, come here!

499
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,100
- Aunt Lacey!

500
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:07,310
(gun firing)

501
00:28:07,311 --> 00:28:09,437
(suspenseful orchestral music)

502
00:28:09,438 --> 00:28:12,357
(gun firing)
(grunting)

503
00:28:12,358 --> 00:28:13,774
- Oh, my God!

504
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:16,612
(music cresendos)

505
00:28:19,365 --> 00:28:21,867
(sirens wail)

506
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:28,499
(voices buzz over intercom)

507
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:31,166
(phone rings)

508
00:28:31,167 --> 00:28:33,085
- [Woman] Paging Dr. Bender.

509
00:28:33,086 --> 00:28:34,588
Paging Dr. Bender.

510
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:40,968
- How is she?

511
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:43,346
- It was close, but she's okay.

512
00:28:43,347 --> 00:28:45,140
The doctor said
she's gonna be fine.

513
00:28:46,308 --> 00:28:48,435
Kids heal fast, and
they forget fast, too.

514
00:28:49,311 --> 00:28:50,144
Come on.

515
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:50,979
She wants to see you.

516
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:56,901
- I'll talk to you
later, sweetie.

517
00:28:56,902 --> 00:28:59,571
- Aunt Lacey, I knew you'd come.

518
00:29:00,781 --> 00:29:02,114
- I had to make
sure those doctors

519
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:03,408
were taking care of you, right?

520
00:29:03,409 --> 00:29:05,910
- I'm okay, but
my shoulder hurts.

521
00:29:05,911 --> 00:29:07,995
- Oh, baby.

522
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:09,830
- It's not so bad.

523
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:13,334
The doctor said he can make it
so there wouldn't be a scar.

524
00:29:13,335 --> 00:29:15,295
But I don't want him to.

525
00:29:15,296 --> 00:29:18,381
I want to show my friends.

526
00:29:18,382 --> 00:29:21,258
- You might want to
think twice about that.

527
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:22,176
- Do you think they're going to

528
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:24,929
keep me here for a long time?

529
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:27,599
- Long enough for me to
organize some ice cream runs.

530
00:29:29,059 --> 00:29:32,437
- Aunt Lacey, why did that
bad person try to hurt you?

531
00:29:32,438 --> 00:29:34,481
- It's because of
something I saw him do.

532
00:29:35,941 --> 00:29:38,275
He doesn't want me to help
the police to catch him.

533
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:40,528
- Are you going to
help the police?

534
00:29:40,529 --> 00:29:41,779
- Of course.

535
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:44,073
- They're going to
catch him, aren't they?

536
00:29:44,074 --> 00:29:44,907
- Yes, Bonnie.

537
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:45,741
They will.

538
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:47,243
- Are you scared?

539
00:29:48,704 --> 00:29:50,497
- Only when I thought
you were hurt.

540
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:52,915
Don't worry about me.

541
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:53,917
You just get better.

542
00:29:56,712 --> 00:29:59,172
We still have your
birthday party to plan.

543
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:09,850
- I'll be right back.

544
00:30:12,478 --> 00:30:15,312
(chattering over intercom)

545
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:17,523
- Now we're all in the
middle of this craziness.

546
00:30:17,524 --> 00:30:18,983
- Oh, Jay, I didn't think--

547
00:30:18,984 --> 00:30:20,901
- Yeah, that's the
problem, nobody thinks.

548
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:22,696
- Stop it, Jay,
you're being stupid.

549
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:26,074
- Lacey, excuse me.

550
00:30:27,493 --> 00:30:28,701
There've been some new
developments in the case.

551
00:30:28,702 --> 00:30:30,411
I'm gonna have to ask
you to come with us.

552
00:30:30,412 --> 00:30:31,245
(phone rings)

553
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:32,080
- I'll be right there.

554
00:30:33,582 --> 00:30:35,124
I'll call you.

555
00:30:35,125 --> 00:30:36,001
- Oh, okay.

556
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:40,422
(phones ring)

557
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,259
- Made a lot of waves

558
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:47,344
at the Attorney General's
office, Ms. Farrell.

559
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:49,514
David Blake, the man you
knew as Curtis Caldwell,

560
00:30:49,515 --> 00:30:51,015
was at the time of
his supposed death

561
00:30:51,016 --> 00:30:53,308
number three on the
FBI's Most Wanted list.

562
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:55,185
He's currently
number one on mine.

563
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:57,062
And as the only person who
can identify Blake's new face,

564
00:30:57,063 --> 00:30:58,856
that makes you a
valuable witness.

565
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:00,525
- I don't want to be
a valuable witness.

566
00:31:00,526 --> 00:31:01,776
I just want to get
on with my life,

567
00:31:01,777 --> 00:31:03,027
forget about all this.

568
00:31:03,028 --> 00:31:04,904
- Do you think Blake's
gonna let you forget?

569
00:31:04,905 --> 00:31:06,030
Our suspicion is
that he's killed

570
00:31:06,031 --> 00:31:07,364
25 people in the last 10 years

571
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:08,783
and I can promise you
he'll have no qualms

572
00:31:08,784 --> 00:31:10,118
about making that 26.

573
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:13,078
- What are you saying to me?

574
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:14,914
- We've decided to put you in
the Witness Protection program

575
00:31:14,915 --> 00:31:17,041
until such time as we
apprehend David Blake.

576
00:31:17,042 --> 00:31:18,793
- You mean I'll
have to leave town?

577
00:31:18,794 --> 00:31:19,960
- Leave everything and anything

578
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:20,920
that can help Blake
track you down

579
00:31:20,921 --> 00:31:22,130
and jeopardize my case.

580
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:24,715
- Your case?

581
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:27,342
I thought we were
talking about my life.

582
00:31:27,343 --> 00:31:29,387
- Both happen to be the
same issue at this point.

583
00:31:30,263 --> 00:31:32,057
- I'm not going anywhere.

584
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:35,059
- Lacey, you have no choice.

585
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:37,937
There's no way we can
protect you 24 hours a day,

586
00:31:37,938 --> 00:31:38,897
if you stay here.

587
00:31:40,273 --> 00:31:42,024
- Where can you protect me?

588
00:31:42,025 --> 00:31:45,654
(dramatic orchestral music)

589
00:31:53,829 --> 00:31:56,998
- Lacey, I'm afraid this is
going to have to stay here.

590
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:02,419
There's no personal photos,
no monogrammed clothing,

591
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:05,047
nothing that would give
away who you really are.

592
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:06,467
Your life could depend on it.

593
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:13,430
- Have you managed to
figure out anything

594
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:15,390
from Heather Greco's
journal pages?

595
00:32:15,391 --> 00:32:16,684
- Not yet.

596
00:32:16,685 --> 00:32:17,935
The pages were covered in blood.

597
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:20,145
We're trying to
lift the stains now.

598
00:32:20,146 --> 00:32:21,939
- There must be something.

599
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,440
- No.

600
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:25,442
We interviewed everyone she
was with, in the last few days.

601
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:30,072
They were all cooperative,
but they were all alibied.

602
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:32,242
(sighing)

603
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:42,919
Lacey, could I ask you
something about your boss?

604
00:32:44,505 --> 00:32:45,337
- Rick?

605
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:46,171
- Mm-hmm.

606
00:32:46,172 --> 00:32:47,840
- What about him?

607
00:32:47,841 --> 00:32:49,800
- Couple of things
have been bugging me.

608
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:52,261
He told you he got the
call from the law firm,

609
00:32:52,262 --> 00:32:54,179
Keller, Roland and Smythe,

610
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:56,808
about Caldwell
wanting the apartment.

611
00:32:58,434 --> 00:33:00,352
- We do a lot of
business with them, so--

612
00:33:00,353 --> 00:33:01,812
- But who would know
to use their name,

613
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:04,650
or who would have an intimate
knowledge of your company?

614
00:33:06,652 --> 00:33:08,904
- Maybe someone at
Keller, Roland and Smythe.

615
00:33:10,947 --> 00:33:13,491
- Did Rick have anything
to do with the Greco girl?

616
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:15,994
- Not professionally.

617
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:20,081
I can't believe Rick
would be involved in this.

618
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:22,457
- Lacey, somebody used you

619
00:33:22,458 --> 00:33:24,252
to get Caldwell
into that apartment.

620
00:33:26,755 --> 00:33:28,924
(sighing)

621
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:33,553
Look, for what it's worth,

622
00:33:33,554 --> 00:33:37,724
I'm gonna do my best to
help you get your life back.

623
00:33:48,694 --> 00:33:51,697
- I don't know what's gonna be
like without you around here.

624
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:58,411
(crying)

625
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:12,382
- Could you give me a moment?

626
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:16,679
I'd just like to take
a last look around.

627
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:21,685
- Okay.

628
00:34:32,863 --> 00:34:36,783
(suspenseful orchestral music)

629
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:48,085
- Lacey, there's no easy
way for me to tell you

630
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:50,420
what you're going to go through.

631
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:52,339
You see, who you
are is a product

632
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:55,801
of everything that you do
in your life on this planet.

633
00:34:55,802 --> 00:35:00,139
Friends, family,
school, work, hobbies.

634
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:04,102
But as of 24 hours ago,
those don't exist anymore.

635
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:07,772
Your continued survival
rests on our ability

636
00:35:07,773 --> 00:35:11,609
to hide you so completely that
the man who's hunting you,

637
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:13,778
with whatever
resources he may have,

638
00:35:13,779 --> 00:35:16,030
will not be able to find you.

639
00:35:16,031 --> 00:35:20,617
It also rests on your ability
to dive into your new identity

640
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:24,371
so fully that nobody you meet
or come into contact with

641
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:27,667
in your new life
will notice anything

642
00:35:27,668 --> 00:35:28,876
to make them believe that you

643
00:35:28,877 --> 00:35:31,046
are not exactly who
you say you are.

644
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:33,630
So, from now on,

645
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:35,716
when you see a reflection
of Lacey Farrell

646
00:35:35,717 --> 00:35:37,968
in a store window
or in a mirror,

647
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:41,431
you have to look away
because that's no longer you.

648
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,975
It's like that old
Jerry Vale song,

649
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:46,519
"Pretend You Don't See Her."

650
00:35:47,688 --> 00:35:49,314
Now, do you think that
you can do that, Lacey?

651
00:35:51,692 --> 00:35:52,943
- I don't know.

652
00:35:53,944 --> 00:35:55,152
- Well, I'd be pretty worried

653
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:57,571
if you had answered
any other way.

654
00:35:57,572 --> 00:35:59,324
Okay, let's get to work.

655
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:04,620
Your name is Alice Carroll.

656
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:10,209
You were born in Hartford,
Connecticut, August 23rd, 1971.

657
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:11,418
(camera clicks)

658
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:13,003
Your mother's name
was Sarah Amber King,

659
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:16,590
and your father was
Jordan Edgar Carroll.

660
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:18,759
They both died in a car accident

661
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,385
when you were 10 years old.

662
00:36:20,386 --> 00:36:22,596
You were raised by
your aunt Theresa

663
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:26,892
and lived at 615 Burton
Street in downtown Hartford,

664
00:36:26,893 --> 00:36:28,685
and your high school
and university

665
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:32,107
were spent in boarding
school in London, England.

666
00:36:45,411 --> 00:36:50,416
(opera music)
(singing in foreign language)

667
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:53,753
(light knocking at door)

668
00:36:53,754 --> 00:36:57,506
- Jimmy, it's almost five.

669
00:36:57,507 --> 00:36:59,384
We have the investor
meeting tonight.

670
00:37:03,889 --> 00:37:05,891
- There was somebody
she was scared of.

671
00:37:07,851 --> 00:37:10,019
But I can't figure
out who it is.

672
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:14,440
- Look, Jimmy, there is no
easy way for me to say this.

673
00:37:15,859 --> 00:37:18,068
The investors are
getting a little anxious.

674
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:20,070
We got 30 mill on the line here.

675
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:21,571
- I haven't lost
sight of the business.

676
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:22,949
That's something I never do.

677
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:25,951
- I know.

678
00:37:25,952 --> 00:37:28,537
I just , I just feel what
you're going through,

679
00:37:28,538 --> 00:37:31,373
and I just wish
I could help you.

680
00:37:31,374 --> 00:37:32,582
- You wanna help me, Steve,

681
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:34,126
you put the word
out on the street.

682
00:37:34,127 --> 00:37:36,046
I wanna know who did
this to my family.

683
00:37:38,548 --> 00:37:40,132
Let them know I'll
be more than generous

684
00:37:40,133 --> 00:37:42,551
to whoever helps me out on this.

685
00:37:42,552 --> 00:37:43,553
- I'm on it.

686
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:47,389
- And Steve?

687
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:48,598
- Yeah?

688
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:50,600
- I asked you to check
out Lacey Farrell.

689
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:52,853
I want to know
everything you found out.

690
00:37:52,854 --> 00:37:55,106
I think there's a chance she
knows more than she told me.

691
00:37:57,233 --> 00:38:02,155
Or told the cops.

692
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:10,454
- Alice Carroll,
215 Burton Street,

693
00:38:10,455 --> 00:38:12,290
Hartford, Connecticut.

694
00:38:13,959 --> 00:38:14,792
06, ugh.

695
00:38:16,878 --> 00:38:18,963
(mumbles)

696
00:38:18,964 --> 00:38:20,547
(knocking on door)

697
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:24,469
(suspenseful orchestral music)

698
00:38:36,481 --> 00:38:38,816
(screaming)

699
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:43,988
- Like they say, Miss,

700
00:38:43,989 --> 00:38:46,656
"You can run, but
you can't hide."

701
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:49,910
(gun firing)

702
00:38:49,911 --> 00:38:53,581
(dramatic orchestral music)

703
00:38:58,003 --> 00:39:00,005
(gasps)

704
00:39:04,634 --> 00:39:06,135
I told you not to worry.

705
00:39:06,136 --> 00:39:08,304
I've taken people out of
Witness Protection before.

706
00:39:10,223 --> 00:39:11,556
The Feds think
they've got it cooked,

707
00:39:11,557 --> 00:39:13,976
but people always
give themselves away.

708
00:39:13,977 --> 00:39:15,228
Dumb creatures of habit.

709
00:39:17,813 --> 00:39:18,648
All right.

710
00:39:21,401 --> 00:39:24,195
(airplane roars)

711
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,369
- [Woman] Southwest
Airlines flight 207-20

712
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:33,787
is now at gate, approaching.

713
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:36,541
Southwest Airlines
flight 207-20.

714
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:40,169
- How was the trip?

715
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:41,004
- The usual.

716
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:43,464
She's all yours now.

717
00:39:45,258 --> 00:39:46,092
Good luck, Alice.

718
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:50,762
- [Svenson] Here.

719
00:39:50,763 --> 00:39:51,597
I'll take this.

720
00:39:53,516 --> 00:39:54,559
- Where are we going?

721
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:57,227
- Name's Svenson.

722
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:59,563
I'll be your contact
here in Minneapolis.

723
00:39:59,564 --> 00:40:03,067
I'll help you get
settled in your new life.

724
00:40:03,068 --> 00:40:05,194
- Is your name really Svenson?

725
00:40:05,195 --> 00:40:07,697
- You don't think I'd choose
a name like that, do you?

726
00:40:10,158 --> 00:40:13,828
(dramatic orchestral music)

727
00:40:40,605 --> 00:40:42,065
Well, here we are.

728
00:40:43,483 --> 00:40:44,317
Home, sweet home.

729
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:50,240
- You have to be kidding.

730
00:41:14,055 --> 00:41:15,639
(door clicking)

731
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,891
- I'll let you get
settled a day or two

732
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:19,977
before we start trying
to get you a job.

733
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:24,064
Until you've got
yourself settled,

734
00:41:24,065 --> 00:41:26,901
we've got you a
regular allowance.

735
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:30,320
I know it's not much.

736
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:32,114
You're probably used to
paying more than that

737
00:41:32,115 --> 00:41:33,657
for a pair of shoes.

738
00:41:33,658 --> 00:41:36,244
But the rent's covered and
it's walking around money.

739
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:40,205
- Is there anyone
else here who knows?

740
00:41:40,206 --> 00:41:41,498
- Nobody.

741
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:44,334
And anybody you meet from now on

742
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:47,171
is only going to know
you as Alice Carroll.

743
00:41:47,172 --> 00:41:48,672
Over the next couple of months,

744
00:41:48,673 --> 00:41:51,675
you're gonna find yourself
becoming a pretty good liar.

745
00:41:51,676 --> 00:41:54,178
Every time somebody asks you

746
00:41:54,179 --> 00:41:56,763
about some aspect of
Alice Carroll's life,

747
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:58,890
you're going to come
up with an answer.

748
00:41:58,891 --> 00:42:00,684
If there's a mythical boyfriend,

749
00:42:00,685 --> 00:42:02,852
think of a real guy
you knew at one point,

750
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:06,856
or wanted to be with,
remembering details
about that guy,

751
00:42:06,857 --> 00:42:11,361
the way he moves, talks, looks
will help make your story

752
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:13,156
more credible and consistent.

753
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:17,201
- You seem to know
a lot about lying.

754
00:42:17,202 --> 00:42:19,078
- Well, that's the
job right now, Alice.

755
00:42:19,079 --> 00:42:20,163
Mine and yours.

756
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:23,207
- What about my family?

757
00:42:23,208 --> 00:42:24,458
When can I call them?

758
00:42:24,459 --> 00:42:27,836
- I'll set up a secure
connection once a week.

759
00:42:27,837 --> 00:42:31,215
Until then, you're on
your own here, Alice.

760
00:42:31,216 --> 00:42:32,258
Try to enjoy it.

761
00:42:33,426 --> 00:42:35,428
I promise, the time
will go smoother.

762
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:57,533
(dramatic orchestral music)

763
00:43:17,303 --> 00:43:19,096
- Why did all this
happen, Heather?

764
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:20,890
Who killed you?

765
00:43:22,267 --> 00:43:24,227
Who stole my life from me?

766
00:43:26,896 --> 00:43:27,812
- [Heather] I guess this weekend

767
00:43:27,813 --> 00:43:30,106
was when I knew it was all over.

768
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:33,109
I've had the feeling he
was using me for a while,

769
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:34,320
but now I'm sure of it.

770
00:43:35,488 --> 00:43:37,822
There were a bunch of
us up at Stowe, skiing.

771
00:43:37,823 --> 00:43:42,828
Ginny, Joy Moore, Ken
Lynch, Gary Kroll.

772
00:43:44,247 --> 00:43:46,623
Then afterwards he came
up, wanting us to be alone.

773
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:47,832
That was no more true

774
00:43:47,833 --> 00:43:49,752
than anything else
he's ever said to me.

775
00:43:51,796 --> 00:43:53,631
- Okay, so who's "he"?

776
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:57,176
- [Heather] Ginny and Gary
came back to New York,

777
00:43:57,177 --> 00:44:00,429
and Ken had to come home
for his radio show today.

778
00:44:00,430 --> 00:44:01,931
That's when I got a call from--

779
00:44:06,269 --> 00:44:07,102
- Man?

780
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:08,813
Manhattan?

781
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:12,192
Someone she knows in town?

782
00:44:14,444 --> 00:44:17,947
What were they warning
you about, Heather?

783
00:44:21,826 --> 00:44:23,785
- [Heather] Now that I
know what I know about him,

784
00:44:23,786 --> 00:44:25,246
I'm even more afraid.

785
00:44:26,331 --> 00:44:28,207
He's angry that I won't see him

786
00:44:28,208 --> 00:44:31,001
and scared that I'll
talk to my father.

787
00:44:32,169 --> 00:44:33,962
Sometimes I think he
might just kill me

788
00:44:33,963 --> 00:44:35,298
just to keep me quiet.

789
00:44:38,384 --> 00:44:40,886
(siren wails)

790
00:44:45,015 --> 00:44:48,227
- Sloane, congratulate
me on my hard work.

791
00:44:48,228 --> 00:44:50,186
- Well, usually I wait
until I hear the results.

792
00:44:50,187 --> 00:44:51,688
(laughs)

793
00:44:51,689 --> 00:44:53,565
- I think your hunch
on Rick Parker,

794
00:44:53,566 --> 00:44:56,526
Lacey's boss, might pan out.

795
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:58,653
I've been running
Parker's social contacts,

796
00:44:58,654 --> 00:45:00,405
and it turns out
he was on the board

797
00:45:00,406 --> 00:45:02,866
of the Forbidden
Theater Company.

798
00:45:02,867 --> 00:45:05,452
Heather Greco was
a principal player

799
00:45:05,453 --> 00:45:07,454
in the troupe last season.

800
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:08,706
Parker had to know her.

801
00:45:09,874 --> 00:45:11,375
- That's a long walk
from what he told us

802
00:45:11,376 --> 00:45:12,959
last time around, isn't it?

803
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,170
- Still, he wasn't
mentioned in her journal.

804
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:18,923
We'd have a hard time
making a solid connection.

805
00:45:18,924 --> 00:45:20,216
- Well, maybe it's
time for you and I

806
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:22,803
to do a little detective
work on Mr. Rick Parker.

807
00:45:56,671 --> 00:45:58,880
- Okay, here's the drill.

808
00:45:58,881 --> 00:46:01,550
This phone is connected
to a bounce network.

809
00:46:01,551 --> 00:46:04,803
It'll go through five cities
before it hits New York again.

810
00:46:04,804 --> 00:46:06,763
There's no way for
anybody to trace

811
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:09,350
where this call is coming
from unless you tell them.

812
00:46:11,018 --> 00:46:11,976
- I understand.

813
00:46:11,977 --> 00:46:13,186
- Remember.

814
00:46:13,187 --> 00:46:14,938
No matter how close
your sister is,

815
00:46:14,939 --> 00:46:18,442
no hints, no local
references, the weather,

816
00:46:18,443 --> 00:46:20,570
nothing that would give
away your location.

817
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:24,656
- What am I supposed
to tell her?

818
00:46:24,657 --> 00:46:26,115
The good news that
I can't get a job

819
00:46:26,116 --> 00:46:27,617
because I don't
have any references,

820
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:30,704
or about all my friends?

821
00:46:30,705 --> 00:46:31,955
That I'm trying to break into
a new city and not being able

822
00:46:31,956 --> 00:46:33,708
not to be truthful
with any of them?

823
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:37,961
- Alice, nobody
said this was easy.

824
00:46:37,962 --> 00:46:39,796
Just try to hang in there.

825
00:46:39,797 --> 00:46:41,297
Remember, it's
hard on them, too,

826
00:46:41,298 --> 00:46:43,968
so try to keep up a good front.

827
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:48,681
I'll be right here,
in case you need me.

828
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:56,146
(phone beeps and dials)

829
00:46:57,690 --> 00:47:00,109
(line rings)

830
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:05,321
- [Kit] Hello?

831
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:06,155
- Kit?

832
00:47:06,156 --> 00:47:08,658
- Oh, Lacey, oh, my God.

833
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:10,619
It's so good to hear your voice.

834
00:47:10,620 --> 00:47:12,162
- It's good to hear yours, too.

835
00:47:13,163 --> 00:47:14,664
- Are you okay?

836
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:16,250
Do you have everything you need?

837
00:47:17,627 --> 00:47:20,421
- Yeah, everything except
for you and Bonnie.

838
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:27,136
It's tough, trying to keep
myself together sometimes.

839
00:47:28,554 --> 00:47:30,179
It's all so weird.

840
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:31,140
- For me, too.

841
00:47:32,517 --> 00:47:35,477
For the first time I
feel so cut off from you.

842
00:47:35,478 --> 00:47:37,687
I don't know what
you're experiencing.

843
00:47:37,688 --> 00:47:40,149
I don't even know what the
weather's like where you are.

844
00:47:41,233 --> 00:47:43,818
- You know I can't
tell you anything, Kit.

845
00:47:43,819 --> 00:47:46,237
- I know, it's just--

846
00:47:46,238 --> 00:47:47,697
- I know.

847
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:49,157
How's Bonnie?

848
00:47:49,158 --> 00:47:51,367
- Oh, she's right here, pulling
the phone out of my hand.

849
00:47:51,368 --> 00:47:54,078
(laughs)

850
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:55,247
- [Bonnie] Aunt Lacey?

851
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:59,208
- Hi, kiddo, how's school?

852
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:00,544
- It sucks.

853
00:48:00,545 --> 00:48:01,712
I miss you.

854
00:48:02,588 --> 00:48:04,338
- I miss you, too.

855
00:48:04,339 --> 00:48:06,340
I hope I don't have
to be here too long.

856
00:48:06,341 --> 00:48:10,554
- You're still going to be back
for my birthday, aren't you?

857
00:48:10,555 --> 00:48:12,806
- Oh, I wouldn't miss that!

858
00:48:12,807 --> 00:48:14,223
- Do you promise?

859
00:48:14,224 --> 00:48:16,392
(dramatic orchestral music)

860
00:48:16,393 --> 00:48:19,646
- Oh, Bonnie, I've
gotta go now, okay?

861
00:48:19,647 --> 00:48:21,815
I'll try and call you next week?

862
00:48:21,816 --> 00:48:22,982
- Okay.

863
00:48:22,983 --> 00:48:24,610
I love you, Aunt Lacey.

864
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:27,279
- I love you, too.

865
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:30,407
Tell Mommy I'll call her later.

866
00:48:31,534 --> 00:48:32,366
Bye.

867
00:48:32,367 --> 00:48:33,202
- Bye.

868
00:48:35,079 --> 00:48:35,912
- Hel--

869
00:48:35,913 --> 00:48:38,749

875
00:49:11,073 --> 00:49:11,906
- Thanks.

876
00:49:11,907 --> 00:49:12,742
- You're welcome.

877
00:49:17,454 --> 00:49:19,331
You thinking of buying a house?

878
00:49:20,750 --> 00:49:24,002
- No, I just like to keep
up with local prices.

879
00:49:24,003 --> 00:49:25,294
- My boyfriend and
me are thinking

880
00:49:25,295 --> 00:49:26,796
about buying on the east side.

881
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:29,048
Maybe a condo or something.

882
00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:30,550
- A condo's okay for now,

883
00:49:30,551 --> 00:49:32,969
but if the market shifts,
it won't hold its value.

884
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:36,765
You'd be better off looking
at St. Paul, Midway District.

885
00:49:36,766 --> 00:49:38,432
You can still find
a three bedroom

886
00:49:38,433 --> 00:49:40,269
with property for under 100.

887
00:49:41,395 --> 00:49:42,979
- Wow, you sure
sound like you know

888
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:44,188
what you're talking about.

889
00:49:44,189 --> 00:49:46,025
Are you a real estate
agent or something?

890
00:49:47,109 --> 00:49:48,568
- Me?

891
00:49:48,569 --> 00:49:51,029
No, my dad was.

892
00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:52,656
I guess it runs in the family.

893
00:49:52,657 --> 00:49:54,742
(laughs)

894
00:50:00,455 --> 00:50:01,831
- [Ken] Hi, this is Ken Lynch

895
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:04,834
on your lunchtime show at WQUV.

896
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:06,335
What do you think of
this weather, folks?

897
00:50:06,336 --> 00:50:07,921
Isn't it great?

898
00:50:07,922 --> 00:50:09,589
Well, you better enjoy
it while it lasts,

899
00:50:09,590 --> 00:50:11,258
'cause you know what's coming.

900
00:50:12,677 --> 00:50:14,761
- [Heather] There were a bunch
of us up at Stowe, skiing.

901
00:50:14,762 --> 00:50:19,766
Ginny, Joy Moore, Ken
Lynch, Gary Kroll.

902
00:50:19,767 --> 00:50:21,685
Ginny and Gary came
back to New York,

903
00:50:21,686 --> 00:50:23,937
and Ken had to come home
for his radio show today.

904
00:50:23,938 --> 00:50:25,521
- [Ken] It's just around
the corner, you know,

905
00:50:25,522 --> 00:50:27,691
and if you want to
work up some body heat,

906
00:50:27,692 --> 00:50:29,317
then the best way to
do it is to join me

907
00:50:29,318 --> 00:50:31,069
at the Twin Times Gym.

908
00:50:31,070 --> 00:50:34,197
Woah, that was a sneaky way
to sneak in a sponsor's plug.

909
00:50:34,198 --> 00:50:35,364
- Excuse me.

910
00:50:35,365 --> 00:50:38,367
Do you know where the
Twin Times Gym is?

911
00:50:38,368 --> 00:50:41,537
(phone rings)

912
00:50:41,538 --> 00:50:42,956
- Hello?

913
00:50:42,957 --> 00:50:44,498
- Mrs. Gray, my
name is Jimmy Greco.

914
00:50:44,499 --> 00:50:45,417
We have never met.

915
00:50:46,586 --> 00:50:48,377
Your sister gave me
something from my wife.

916
00:50:48,378 --> 00:50:51,715
I have spent hours trying to
make sense of it, but I can't.

917
00:50:51,716 --> 00:50:53,549
- Lacey never discussed
anything like that

918
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:54,926
with me, Mr. Greco.

919
00:50:54,927 --> 00:50:57,721
- I see, but your sister
might know something

920
00:50:57,722 --> 00:51:00,682
about what happened to my wife.

921
00:51:00,683 --> 00:51:02,601
Something she doesn't
even realize is important,

922
00:51:02,602 --> 00:51:05,561
you know some clue as
to who she suspected.

923
00:51:05,562 --> 00:51:08,356
- If you want me to tell you
how to get in contact with her,

924
00:51:08,357 --> 00:51:10,024
I can't do that.

925
00:51:10,025 --> 00:51:12,151
I mean, even if I wanted to.

926
00:51:12,152 --> 00:51:13,402
- I see.

927
00:51:13,403 --> 00:51:15,071
But if you do hear
from your sister,

928
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:17,573
please, please tell
her what I said.

929
00:51:17,574 --> 00:51:18,783
- Okay.

930
00:51:18,784 --> 00:51:20,326
- And by the way, would
you and your husband

931
00:51:20,327 --> 00:51:22,871
like to have lunch
with me tomorrow?

932
00:51:22,872 --> 00:51:24,706
- Oh, I don't know.

933
00:51:24,707 --> 00:51:26,499
- Well, just think about it.

934
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:27,334
And let me know.

935
00:51:28,252 --> 00:51:29,252
- Okay.

936
00:51:29,253 --> 00:51:30,087
- Thank you.

937
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:33,757
- Who was that?

938
00:51:33,758 --> 00:51:35,591
- That was Jimmy Greco.

939
00:51:35,592 --> 00:51:37,301
He wanted to get in
touch with Lacey.

940
00:51:37,302 --> 00:51:38,804
- Guess he's not the only one.

941
00:51:40,555 --> 00:51:42,181
- He invited us
to lunch tomorrow,

942
00:51:42,182 --> 00:51:43,767
but I don't know
if we should go.

943
00:51:43,768 --> 00:51:45,226
- Are you kidding?

944
00:51:45,227 --> 00:51:46,519
Free meal at the owner's table?

945
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:47,937
Sweetheart, we don't
get to rub shoulders

946
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:49,648
with people like that very much.

947
00:51:49,649 --> 00:51:51,941
And with his new casino opening,

948
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:53,567
maybe he'll need some people
who know what they're doing.

949
00:51:53,568 --> 00:51:55,486
Maybe all this trouble
we got into lately

950
00:51:55,487 --> 00:51:57,071
can turn out to be profitable.

951
00:51:57,072 --> 00:51:59,033
(sighs)

952
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:03,162
(ambulance siren wails)

953
00:52:05,873 --> 00:52:07,373
- No, no, thank you.

954
00:52:07,374 --> 00:52:09,418
No, I'll get back to you if
I have any more questions.

955
00:52:11,295 --> 00:52:12,129
Oh, yeah.

956
00:52:13,297 --> 00:52:14,505
- Who was that?

957
00:52:14,506 --> 00:52:16,132
- That was Heather
Greco's agent.

958
00:52:16,133 --> 00:52:17,926
Seems Heather was
having some problems

959
00:52:17,927 --> 00:52:19,635
with contract negotiations,

960
00:52:19,636 --> 00:52:22,638
and it seemed to get better
when she had a private dinner

961
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:24,974
with one of the board members.

962
00:52:24,975 --> 00:52:26,267
- Let me guess.

963
00:52:26,268 --> 00:52:27,185
Rick Parker.

964
00:52:27,186 --> 00:52:28,603
- Found him very charming.

965
00:52:29,772 --> 00:52:30,689
- Did the agent
say anything else

966
00:52:30,690 --> 00:52:31,981
about an ongoing relationship?

967
00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:33,566
- No, didn't say where
it went from there,

968
00:52:33,567 --> 00:52:36,987
so maybe we should
go ask Mr. Parker.

969
00:52:46,163 --> 00:52:47,580
- And on the lower level,

970
00:52:47,581 --> 00:52:49,999
you'll find the pool,
whirlpool and the steam room.

971
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,500
- Looks really well-equipped.

972
00:52:51,501 --> 00:52:53,962
I'm glad you have the free
weights as well as the machines.

973
00:52:53,963 --> 00:52:55,421
- Any kind of work-out
you want to do, Alice,

974
00:52:55,422 --> 00:52:56,756
you can do here.

975
00:52:56,757 --> 00:52:58,925
Can I ask how you found
out about our club?

976
00:52:58,926 --> 00:53:02,136
- I was listening to WUQV,

977
00:53:02,137 --> 00:53:03,637
and the announcer
was talking about it.

978
00:53:03,638 --> 00:53:04,848
- Ken Lynch.

979
00:53:04,849 --> 00:53:06,349
- Right.

980
00:53:06,350 --> 00:53:07,350
- Ken comes in every night
at five, after his shift.

981
00:53:07,351 --> 00:53:08,267
And in case you're wondering,

982
00:53:08,268 --> 00:53:10,228
yes, he is as cute as he sounds.

983
00:53:10,229 --> 00:53:12,688
- Well, that sounds like
I'll be here about five.

984
00:53:12,689 --> 00:53:13,522
- Great.

985
00:53:13,523 --> 00:53:14,816
- Where do I sign?

986
00:53:14,817 --> 00:53:15,901
- Here and here.

987
00:53:20,781 --> 00:53:21,781
- [Lacey] I joined a gym today.

988
00:53:21,782 --> 00:53:22,824
- Well, that's good.

989
00:53:22,825 --> 00:53:24,826
Do you feel better?

990
00:53:24,827 --> 00:53:27,453
- I feel like I'm doing
something, anyway.

991
00:53:27,454 --> 00:53:28,955
- Lacey, I can't take
much more of this,

992
00:53:28,956 --> 00:53:30,790
not knowing where you are.

993
00:53:30,791 --> 00:53:33,334
Every time I hear
about an earthquake,

994
00:53:33,335 --> 00:53:34,836
a plane crash or a fire,

995
00:53:34,837 --> 00:53:37,713
I wonder if you're in it,
I wonder if you're okay.

996
00:53:37,714 --> 00:53:39,590
- Kit, we've been
through all this.

997
00:53:39,591 --> 00:53:41,384
- I know, I know, I know.

998
00:53:41,385 --> 00:53:42,802
You can't tell me
where you're at.

999
00:53:42,803 --> 00:53:44,720
But can you at least
give me a hint?

1000
00:53:44,721 --> 00:53:47,223
- You realize anything I
tell you could get me killed?

1001
00:53:47,224 --> 00:53:49,268
- I won't breathe
a word to anybody.

1002
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:53,021
(sighs)

1003
00:53:53,022 --> 00:53:55,565
- You remember where Daddy
did his basic training?

1004
00:53:56,608 --> 00:53:59,903
I might be somewhere near there.

1005
00:53:59,904 --> 00:54:00,653
(sighs)

1006
00:54:00,654 --> 00:54:01,695
- Thank you.

1007
00:54:01,696 --> 00:54:04,116
I won't say a word to anybody.

1008
00:54:04,992 --> 00:54:06,575
I'll be thinking about you.

1009
00:54:06,576 --> 00:54:07,911
- Me, too.

1010
00:54:07,912 --> 00:54:09,745
Send my love to Bonnie.

1011
00:54:09,746 --> 00:54:10,663
- Okay.

1012
00:54:10,664 --> 00:54:12,248
(dramatic orchestral music)

1013
00:54:12,249 --> 00:54:13,666
(phone beeping)

1014
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:15,836
(sighing)

1015
00:54:27,890 --> 00:54:29,432
- You okay?

1016
00:54:29,433 --> 00:54:30,850
- What do you want
me to say, Svenson?

1017
00:54:30,851 --> 00:54:32,311
No, I'm not okay.

1018
00:54:33,478 --> 00:54:34,979
- Alice.

1019
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:36,439
- Don't call me that.

1020
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:37,899
I'm not Alice.

1021
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:40,151
My name is Lacey Farrell.

1022
00:54:40,152 --> 00:54:41,444
Just because I happened to be

1023
00:54:41,445 --> 00:54:42,946
in the wrong place
at the wrong time,

1024
00:54:42,947 --> 00:54:46,115
and I happened to see some
monster kill Chantal Greco,

1025
00:54:46,116 --> 00:54:47,575
you people have taken everything

1026
00:54:47,576 --> 00:54:49,243
and everyone I ever
cared about away from me.

1027
00:54:49,244 --> 00:54:50,453
- Think about what
you're saying.

1028
00:54:50,454 --> 00:54:52,538
We didn't take those
things away from you.

1029
00:54:52,539 --> 00:54:53,747
- Oh, no?

1030
00:54:53,748 --> 00:54:55,124
- It was David Blake.

1031
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:57,251
(sighing)

1032
00:54:57,252 --> 00:55:00,296
- All I know is that I'm here,

1033
00:55:00,297 --> 00:55:03,216
living in some
rundown apartment,

1034
00:55:03,217 --> 00:55:04,467
always alone, always scared,

1035
00:55:04,468 --> 00:55:07,178
and he's out there on
the street somewhere,

1036
00:55:07,179 --> 00:55:10,140
free as a bird, and
it makes me mad.

1037
00:55:47,552 --> 00:55:48,387
Excuse me.

1038
00:55:49,304 --> 00:55:50,139
Excuse me?

1039
00:55:52,099 --> 00:55:53,599
Uh, sorry to bother you.

1040
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:56,435
Do you know how to
set the timer on this?

1041
00:55:56,436 --> 00:56:00,024
- Uh, you hit function
twice to get to the time,

1042
00:56:01,150 --> 00:56:03,110
and then you put in
the time and hit enter.

1043
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:09,823
- These things get more
complicated all the time.

1044
00:56:09,824 --> 00:56:11,450
- Uh, you know what they say.

1045
00:56:11,451 --> 00:56:12,785
To ere is human.

1046
00:56:12,786 --> 00:56:14,788
To really screw up,
you need a computer.

1047
00:56:19,334 --> 00:56:21,377
Haven't seen you
around here before.

1048
00:56:21,378 --> 00:56:22,546
- Oh, I just joined.

1049
00:56:26,091 --> 00:56:29,928
Name's Alice Carroll, and you?

1050
00:56:29,929 --> 00:56:31,595
- Ken, Ken Lynch.

1051
00:56:31,596 --> 00:56:33,598
- Well, thanks for
your help, Ken Lynch.

1052
00:56:50,824 --> 00:56:55,411
(singing in foreign language)

1053
00:56:55,412 --> 00:56:56,329
- Okay, come on.

1054
00:56:56,330 --> 00:56:57,080
We're already five minutes late.

1055
00:56:57,081 --> 00:56:58,497
Let's go.

1056
00:56:58,498 --> 00:56:59,749
- [Kit] Coming.

1057
00:57:05,005 --> 00:57:06,755
- Well, Mr. Greco was very
happy that you could make it.

1058
00:57:06,756 --> 00:57:08,757
- Oh, are you kidding?

1059
00:57:08,758 --> 00:57:10,051
We're happy to be here.

1060
00:57:10,052 --> 00:57:11,260
- It seems like a
very nice restaurant.

1061
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:12,179
- Well, thank you.

1062
00:57:15,432 --> 00:57:17,100
- Oh, I'm so glad
you could come.

1063
00:57:17,101 --> 00:57:18,309
- [Kit] Hello.

1064
00:57:18,310 --> 00:57:19,560
- Mrs. Gray, I'm
pleased to meet you.

1065
00:57:19,561 --> 00:57:20,394
Jimmy Greco.

1066
00:57:20,395 --> 00:57:21,812
- Jay, nice to meet you.

1067
00:57:21,813 --> 00:57:23,189
- Please make
yourselves at home.

1068
00:57:23,190 --> 00:57:24,023
- May I?

1069
00:57:24,024 --> 00:57:24,984
- Thank you.

1070
00:57:27,111 --> 00:57:28,486
- [Kit] Oh, that's
fine, thank you.

1071
00:57:28,487 --> 00:57:30,613
- [Jimmy] That'll be all, Carlo.

1072
00:57:30,614 --> 00:57:35,243
Well, would you like to
have a glass of wine or--

1073
00:57:35,244 --> 00:57:36,369
- [Kit] Yes, thank you.

1074
00:57:36,370 --> 00:57:39,456
- We have a nice
chateau briand, thanks.

1075
00:57:40,957 --> 00:57:42,459
- [Jay] Thank you.

1076
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:47,839
(suspenseful orchestral music)

1077
00:57:50,967 --> 00:57:53,762
(water splashes)

1078
00:58:06,525 --> 00:58:07,358
- Yeah, I just arrived.

1079
00:58:07,359 --> 00:58:08,402
Thanks for the lead.

1080
00:58:09,944 --> 00:58:11,280
It'll be easy from here.

1081
00:58:13,032 --> 00:58:15,116
People can change their
names but not their habits.

1082
00:58:15,117 --> 00:58:17,036
I'll check in tomorrow.

1083
00:58:18,912 --> 00:58:21,498
(change drops)

1084
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:42,351
- Ken, right?

1085
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:43,686
- Right.

1086
00:58:43,687 --> 00:58:44,520
Alice!

1087
00:58:44,521 --> 00:58:45,604
- Right!

1088
00:58:45,605 --> 00:58:47,190
Um, is this seat taken?

1089
00:58:47,191 --> 00:58:48,024
- No, please.

1090
00:58:49,901 --> 00:58:51,319
- Uh, would you like a drink?

1091
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:52,861
- Uh, carrot juice, please.

1092
00:58:52,862 --> 00:58:53,697
- Carrot.

1093
00:58:55,199 --> 00:58:57,616
So, how are you
enjoying Minneapolis?

1094
00:58:57,617 --> 00:58:58,867
- Oh, I love it.

1095
00:58:58,868 --> 00:59:00,494
- Well, that's just
because you moved in

1096
00:59:00,495 --> 00:59:03,664
after black fly season
and before winter.

1097
00:59:03,665 --> 00:59:04,999
- Don't scare me off.

1098
00:59:06,168 --> 00:59:08,461
The job market is
doing that already.

1099
00:59:08,462 --> 00:59:09,378
- Really?

1100
00:59:09,379 --> 00:59:10,629
What kind of work do you do?

1101
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:13,591
- I worked billing in a
pediatrician's office,

1102
00:59:13,592 --> 00:59:15,843
but I'm looking to do
something different.

1103
00:59:15,844 --> 00:59:17,386
Thank you.

1104
00:59:17,387 --> 00:59:18,846
All those forms.

1105
00:59:18,847 --> 00:59:20,264
By the time I got home,

1106
00:59:20,265 --> 00:59:23,184
I'd be filling out my
shopping list in triplicate.

1107
00:59:23,185 --> 00:59:24,643
- You know, somehow,

1108
00:59:24,644 --> 00:59:27,772
I can't see you stuck in the
back room of a doctor's office.

1109
00:59:28,898 --> 00:59:30,483
You'd be great at
something more social

1110
00:59:30,484 --> 00:59:32,944
like, um, sales, maybe.

1111
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:36,780
- Maybe I'll give that a try.

1112
00:59:36,781 --> 00:59:38,116
Thanks for the suggestion.

1113
00:59:38,117 --> 00:59:38,950
- You're welcome.

1114
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:41,076
- The first thing I have to do

1115
00:59:41,077 --> 00:59:42,579
is find my way around this town.

1116
00:59:43,747 --> 00:59:47,250
- Well, actually I have
another suggestion.

1117
00:59:47,251 --> 00:59:49,001
I could give you the $2 tour

1118
00:59:49,002 --> 00:59:51,796
and maybe we can even get
something to eat, afterwards.

1119
00:59:54,090 --> 00:59:55,591
- You know what?

1120
00:59:55,592 --> 00:59:58,887
Minneapolis is looking more
interesting all the time.

1121
01:00:19,658 --> 01:00:23,245
(ominous orchestral music)

1122
01:00:25,580 --> 01:00:26,539
- Do you have a moment?

1123
01:00:26,540 --> 01:00:27,415
- Sure.

1124
01:00:27,416 --> 01:00:28,417
- Thank you.

1125
01:00:30,252 --> 01:00:32,295
I'm actually not
here to buy a home.

1126
01:00:32,296 --> 01:00:33,254
- Okay.

1127
01:00:33,255 --> 01:00:35,130
- This is about my sister.

1128
01:00:35,131 --> 01:00:36,048
Her name is Lacey.

1129
01:00:36,049 --> 01:00:37,426
She left home a while ago.

1130
01:00:38,552 --> 01:00:39,802
There was an argument
with our mother,

1131
01:00:39,803 --> 01:00:41,720
and you know how
these things happen.

1132
01:00:41,721 --> 01:00:43,306
- I guess I do.

1133
01:00:43,307 --> 01:00:45,184
I've had a few tiffs
with my mom, too.

1134
01:00:46,310 --> 01:00:48,311
- Anyway, our mom
passed away last month,

1135
01:00:48,312 --> 01:00:51,689
and since Lacey worked in
real estate back in New York,

1136
01:00:51,690 --> 01:00:53,482
I've been making the rounds
of the brokerages here,

1137
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:54,525
trying to find her.

1138
01:00:54,526 --> 01:00:56,068
I just wanted to tell her.

1139
01:00:56,069 --> 01:00:58,321
Thought maybe at least the
two of us could make peace.

1140
01:00:58,322 --> 01:00:59,905
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

1141
01:00:59,906 --> 01:01:02,450
I haven't had anyone named
Lacey apply for work here.

1142
01:01:02,451 --> 01:01:03,660
I wish I could help you.

1143
01:01:05,370 --> 01:01:06,329
- Now, the friends who told me

1144
01:01:06,330 --> 01:01:08,331
she was moving to Minneapolis,

1145
01:01:08,332 --> 01:01:11,292
they thought she might
have changed her name.

1146
01:01:11,293 --> 01:01:12,210
This is her.

1147
01:01:12,211 --> 01:01:16,004
(suspenseful orchestral music)

1148
01:01:16,005 --> 01:01:17,674
- I'm sorry, I
wish I could help.

1149
01:01:19,676 --> 01:01:21,385
Maybe, if you leave your number,

1150
01:01:21,386 --> 01:01:23,053
if I see her, I could call you.

1151
01:01:23,054 --> 01:01:23,888
- Bless you.

1152
01:01:26,475 --> 01:01:28,351
(gentle piano music)

1153
01:01:28,352 --> 01:01:30,936
- So, what made you choose
Minneapolis, anyway?

1154
01:01:30,937 --> 01:01:33,815
- I don't know, my
mom and dad were gone,

1155
01:01:34,941 --> 01:01:37,109
I don't have any
brothers or sisters,

1156
01:01:37,110 --> 01:01:39,279
and my aunt moved out
West for the climate.

1157
01:01:40,739 --> 01:01:41,948
Why Minneapolis?

1158
01:01:43,617 --> 01:01:45,075
It wasn't Hartford, I guess.

1159
01:01:45,076 --> 01:01:47,536
That's not much of
a reason, is it?

1160
01:01:47,537 --> 01:01:49,414
- Well, Hartford's
loss is our gain.

1161
01:01:52,542 --> 01:01:55,002
How'd you like
what you saw today?

1162
01:01:55,003 --> 01:01:57,755
- The Institute of
Arts was fabulous.

1163
01:01:57,756 --> 01:01:59,965
I'd seen prints of
Gauguin's Tahitian Landscape

1164
01:01:59,966 --> 01:02:02,927
but the colors of the real
thing were so much more vivid!

1165
01:02:04,137 --> 01:02:05,095
- Well, if you liked
that, there's still

1166
01:02:05,096 --> 01:02:07,265
the Weisman Museum to see,

1167
01:02:07,266 --> 01:02:09,600
and the Nairobi Minneapolis.

1168
01:02:09,601 --> 01:02:10,976
- What about theater?

1169
01:02:10,977 --> 01:02:12,561
- They say there's
something like 30 companies

1170
01:02:12,562 --> 01:02:14,313
playing at any given time.

1171
01:02:14,314 --> 01:02:15,439
Do you like theater?

1172
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:16,940
- I do.

1173
01:02:16,941 --> 01:02:20,193
I made it to New York last
year, to see "The Tea Room."

1174
01:02:20,194 --> 01:02:21,737
I loved it.

1175
01:02:21,738 --> 01:02:22,572
Did you see it?

1176
01:02:24,073 --> 01:02:24,908
- Yes.

1177
01:02:26,075 --> 01:02:29,202
Actually, I knew the
actress, Heather Greco.

1178
01:02:29,203 --> 01:02:33,374
I met her, anyway, through some
mutual friends in the play.

1179
01:02:33,375 --> 01:02:34,208
- Really?

1180
01:02:35,084 --> 01:02:37,044
- Well, my cousin's an actress.

1181
01:02:37,045 --> 01:02:39,547
- It's terrible what
happened to her.

1182
01:02:39,548 --> 01:02:40,714
Especially since they're saying

1183
01:02:40,715 --> 01:02:42,551
her death was probably murder.

1184
01:02:45,887 --> 01:02:47,138
- Who's saying it was murder?

1185
01:02:48,097 --> 01:02:49,598
- Oh, it's just a rumor.

1186
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:51,099
You know how these things
get around in the press.

1187
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:53,811
- Well, people should learn
that rumors are dangerous.

1188
01:02:53,812 --> 01:02:54,938
People can get hurt.

1189
01:02:59,275 --> 01:03:00,276
- What was she like?

1190
01:03:02,779 --> 01:03:04,447
(laughs)

1191
01:03:04,448 --> 01:03:06,782
- I feel like I'm being
interviewed on a talk show.

1192
01:03:06,783 --> 01:03:09,242
(laughs)

1193
01:03:09,243 --> 01:03:12,621
- We don't get to
meet celebrities
much, where I'm from.

1194
01:03:12,622 --> 01:03:16,709
I guess I'm interested in
the kind of people you know,

1195
01:03:16,710 --> 01:03:17,877
what your life is like.

1196
01:03:19,003 --> 01:03:20,629
(laughs)

1197
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:22,465
- If I'm a celebrity,
then you really haven't

1198
01:03:22,466 --> 01:03:23,549
been getting around much.

1199
01:03:23,550 --> 01:03:25,968
(both laugh)

1200
01:03:25,969 --> 01:03:28,304
But let's see what
we can do about that.

1201
01:03:32,809 --> 01:03:35,978
- Detective Sloane, please.

1202
01:03:35,979 --> 01:03:37,270
- [Sloane] Hello.

1203
01:03:37,271 --> 01:03:39,107
- Detective Sloane,
it's Lacey Farrell.

1204
01:03:40,274 --> 01:03:41,984
- Right, how're
they treating you?

1205
01:03:41,985 --> 01:03:44,319
- Fine, if you
don't mind giving up

1206
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:47,114
absolutely everything
in your life.

1207
01:03:47,115 --> 01:03:49,241
Including all the little things.

1208
01:03:49,242 --> 01:03:50,493
I never knew how
important they were

1209
01:03:50,494 --> 01:03:52,160
until they took
them away from me.

1210
01:03:52,161 --> 01:03:53,829
- I know, Lacey, I know.

1211
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:54,663
You don't deserve it.

1212
01:03:54,664 --> 01:03:56,081
You were the victim.

1213
01:03:56,082 --> 01:03:58,166
Now, you're the one
who's suffering.

1214
01:03:58,167 --> 01:03:59,627
Now, but, listen.

1215
01:03:59,628 --> 01:04:00,544
We'll find this guy, and
then we'll get you back here.

1216
01:04:00,545 --> 01:04:01,670
All right?

1217
01:04:01,671 --> 01:04:02,630
- I'm sorry to say this,

1218
01:04:02,631 --> 01:04:04,423
but you're the only one I trust

1219
01:04:04,424 --> 01:04:06,133
in this investigation, Sloane.

1220
01:04:06,134 --> 01:04:07,385
I need somebody to help me.

1221
01:04:07,386 --> 01:04:08,428
- What can I do?

1222
01:04:09,763 --> 01:04:12,848
- Ken Lynch, the radio
announcer in Heather's diary?

1223
01:04:12,849 --> 01:04:15,017
What do you have on him?

1224
01:04:15,018 --> 01:04:17,895
- Lacey, this is a
police investigation.

1225
01:04:17,896 --> 01:04:20,105
You can't just go
butting around in it.

1226
01:04:20,106 --> 01:04:22,149
You have to leave that to
us and the Feds, all right?

1227
01:04:22,150 --> 01:04:25,152
If this guy's involved, just
imagine what he'll do to you.

1228
01:04:25,153 --> 01:04:26,695
- Lacey Farrell is already dead.

1229
01:04:26,696 --> 01:04:29,072
There's not much more that
they can take away from me.

1230
01:04:29,073 --> 01:04:32,034
- Lacey, please, for me, just
stay out of it, all right?

1231
01:04:32,035 --> 01:04:33,952
Our people have already
questioned Ken Lynch,

1232
01:04:33,953 --> 01:04:36,498
but I'll take another
crack at him, myself, okay?

1233
01:04:40,919 --> 01:04:45,464
- Try and find out who's behind
all this, will you please?

1234
01:04:45,465 --> 01:04:47,551
- Listen, it's my
number one priority.

1235
01:04:54,223 --> 01:04:57,893
(phone clicks in receiver)

1236
01:04:57,894 --> 01:04:58,852
- I don't know.

1237
01:04:58,853 --> 01:05:00,062
Ever since we went out together,

1238
01:05:00,063 --> 01:05:01,229
I haven't been
able to reach her.

1239
01:05:01,230 --> 01:05:02,147
- Is there something
we should know

1240
01:05:02,148 --> 01:05:03,357
about your eating habits, Ken?

1241
01:05:04,734 --> 01:05:06,234
(chuckles)

1242
01:05:06,235 --> 01:05:07,445
- There's gotta be a way I
can get in touch with her.

1243
01:05:07,446 --> 01:05:08,529
Do you have her
address or anything?

1244
01:05:08,530 --> 01:05:09,863
- Actually, I don't.

1245
01:05:09,864 --> 01:05:11,323
I thought it was strange,

1246
01:05:11,324 --> 01:05:13,159
but when she signed up,
she just gave a box number.

1247
01:05:15,286 --> 01:05:17,580
- Listen, if she calls, ask
her to call me, will you?

1248
01:05:17,581 --> 01:05:18,414
- Sure.

1249
01:05:24,337 --> 01:05:26,506
(sighing)

1250
01:05:29,342 --> 01:05:34,347
(suspenseful orchestral music)
(cellphone rings)

1251
01:05:35,599 --> 01:05:36,432
- Yes?

1252
01:05:39,393 --> 01:05:41,395
It's taking a little
longer than I thought.

1253
01:05:42,396 --> 01:05:43,606
She's smart enough to stay out

1254
01:05:43,607 --> 01:05:45,316
of the real estate
business, that's why.

1255
01:05:46,485 --> 01:05:48,528
Don't worry, I'm already
working another angle.

1256
01:05:50,238 --> 01:05:52,907
(phone beeping)

1257
01:05:56,244 --> 01:05:57,078
Excuse me.

1258
01:06:01,708 --> 01:06:04,459
- Oh, Alice, Ken Lynch
was looking for you.

1259
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:06,545
- Oh, I'll have to
give him a call later.

1260
01:06:06,546 --> 01:06:07,796
- Really?

1261
01:06:07,797 --> 01:06:09,840
Because he said he was
trying to reach you.

1262
01:06:09,841 --> 01:06:13,010
- Well, nothing stays
secret in here, does it?

1263
01:06:13,011 --> 01:06:15,764
- If somebody turns down
Ken Lynch, that's news.

1264
01:06:16,973 --> 01:06:18,850
- I wouldn't want to
hurt his reputation.

1265
01:06:36,576 --> 01:06:38,912
(dog barks)

1266
01:06:56,179 --> 01:06:57,137
(suspenseful orchestral music)
(shrieks)

1267
01:06:57,138 --> 01:06:58,389
- Alice, Alice!

1268
01:06:59,849 --> 01:07:02,727
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I
didn't mean to scare you.

1269
01:07:03,603 --> 01:07:05,520
- What are you doing here?

1270
01:07:05,521 --> 01:07:07,106
- You wouldn't return my calls.

1271
01:07:08,066 --> 01:07:09,693
I followed you from the club.

1272
01:07:10,902 --> 01:07:12,235
- You have to leave, Ken.

1273
01:07:12,236 --> 01:07:13,320
- Why?

1274
01:07:13,321 --> 01:07:14,279
Tell me what's going on.

1275
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:16,323
Why won't you talk to me?

1276
01:07:16,324 --> 01:07:18,742
I thought something
nice was starting.

1277
01:07:18,743 --> 01:07:20,493
- Well, you thought wrong.

1278
01:07:20,494 --> 01:07:21,954
I can't see you, Ken.

1279
01:07:21,955 --> 01:07:23,997
- Alice, what's wrong?

1280
01:07:23,998 --> 01:07:25,208
Are you seeing somebody?

1281
01:07:26,375 --> 01:07:27,292
- That's none of your business.

1282
01:07:27,293 --> 01:07:28,712
- Why all the damn secrecy?

1283
01:07:29,921 --> 01:07:31,673
- Just leave me alone, please.

1284
01:07:37,553 --> 01:07:39,973
(door slams)

1285
01:07:57,198 --> 01:08:01,159
(emergency sirens wail)

1286
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:02,786
(car horn beeps)

1287
01:08:02,787 --> 01:08:04,162
- I don't even know
what I'm doing here.

1288
01:08:04,163 --> 01:08:05,247
I told you everything I knew

1289
01:08:05,248 --> 01:08:07,625
at the Greco
apartment that night.

1290
01:08:07,626 --> 01:08:09,251
- Maybe I'll tell you some stuff

1291
01:08:09,252 --> 01:08:11,837
that I know that
even you don't know.

1292
01:08:11,838 --> 01:08:14,590
About your relationship
with Heather Greco.

1293
01:08:15,675 --> 01:08:16,884
- Relationship?

1294
01:08:16,885 --> 01:08:17,801
- Mm-hmm.

1295
01:08:17,802 --> 01:08:19,052
- I'd hardly call what I had

1296
01:08:19,053 --> 01:08:20,763
with Heather Greco
a relationship.

1297
01:08:20,764 --> 01:08:23,849
- Oh, that's not what
I've been hearing.

1298
01:08:23,850 --> 01:08:25,183
- We went for dinner once.

1299
01:08:25,184 --> 01:08:26,185
We talked business.

1300
01:08:27,603 --> 01:08:28,771
- Why didn't you tell us that

1301
01:08:28,772 --> 01:08:30,940
the night that
Chantal was murdered?

1302
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:33,608
- Tell you what?

1303
01:08:33,609 --> 01:08:35,778
That I knew Heather but
didn't know Chantal?

1304
01:08:35,779 --> 01:08:37,781
- All right, so you
didn't know Chantal.

1305
01:08:38,698 --> 01:08:39,948
But you meet the daughter,

1306
01:08:39,949 --> 01:08:41,617
and a few months
later, she's dead.

1307
01:08:42,702 --> 01:08:43,952
And the mother just so happens

1308
01:08:43,953 --> 01:08:46,039
to call you to sell her place.

1309
01:08:47,165 --> 01:08:49,291
And then, the killer
just so happens

1310
01:08:49,292 --> 01:08:51,584
to call you to get
into that place.

1311
01:08:51,585 --> 01:08:53,963
I mean, what am I
supposed to make of that?

1312
01:08:55,381 --> 01:08:56,631
- It's all coincidence.

1313
01:08:56,632 --> 01:08:58,050
- Oh, no, no, no.

1314
01:08:58,051 --> 01:09:01,054
Coincidence is when
things are not connected.

1315
01:09:02,764 --> 01:09:04,973
As far as I'm concerned,
there are too many

1316
01:09:04,974 --> 01:09:07,935
connected things here
for me not to believe

1317
01:09:07,936 --> 01:09:10,645
that you're involved
in something.

1318
01:09:10,646 --> 01:09:14,525
(suspenseful orchestral music)

1319
01:09:15,819 --> 01:09:20,072
- Either you arrest me,
or let me go, detective.

1320
01:09:20,073 --> 01:09:21,949
I'm not going to talk
to you any further

1321
01:09:21,950 --> 01:09:23,201
without a lawyer present.

1322
01:09:36,089 --> 01:09:38,758
(machine beeps)

1323
01:09:41,552 --> 01:09:42,386
- [Ken] Alice.

1324
01:09:45,431 --> 01:09:48,184
- I'm sorry about last
night, let me explain.

1325
01:09:49,352 --> 01:09:52,520
- Don't bother, he
explained everything.

1326
01:09:52,521 --> 01:09:55,858
(dramatic music crescendos)

1327
01:09:55,859 --> 01:09:56,817
(gasps)

1328
01:09:56,818 --> 01:09:57,986
- Nowhere to hide, Lacey.

1329
01:09:59,195 --> 01:10:01,364
(screams)

1330
01:10:04,868 --> 01:10:08,036
(handgun fires)

1331
01:10:08,037 --> 01:10:10,206
(screams)

1332
01:10:17,881 --> 01:10:19,883
(gasps)

1333
01:10:27,056 --> 01:10:27,890
- Hi.

1334
01:10:27,891 --> 01:10:28,974
- [Blake] Hi.

1335
01:10:28,975 --> 01:10:29,808
- Can I help you?

1336
01:10:29,809 --> 01:10:31,059
- I hope so.

1337
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:33,728
I'm actually trying
to find my sister.

1338
01:10:33,729 --> 01:10:35,022
Her name is Lacey,

1339
01:10:35,023 --> 01:10:36,900
and I believe she moved
here a short while ago.

1340
01:10:38,401 --> 01:10:40,735
Lacey had a fight with our
mother and left the family.

1341
01:10:40,736 --> 01:10:43,030
And our mom passed
away last month.

1342
01:10:43,031 --> 01:10:45,408
I'm looking for Lacey,
trying to patch things up.

1343
01:10:46,534 --> 01:10:47,785
She's a really physical girl.

1344
01:10:47,786 --> 01:10:49,119
I'm sure she'd be
joining a health club

1345
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:50,121
wherever she is, so,

1346
01:10:52,081 --> 01:10:52,916
this is her.

1347
01:10:58,379 --> 01:11:02,383
I'd really appreciate any
help you could give me.

1348
01:11:06,762 --> 01:11:09,891
- Gee, I'm really sorry,
but I haven't seen her.

1349
01:11:11,434 --> 01:11:12,851
- Thanks.

1350
01:11:12,852 --> 01:11:14,686
- You're welcome.

1351
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:15,687
- I'll get back to you.

1352
01:11:15,688 --> 01:11:16,522
- Okay.

1353
01:11:27,033 --> 01:11:28,491
What was that all about?

1354
01:11:28,492 --> 01:11:31,119
- Alice said she didn't have
any brothers or sisters.

1355
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:33,789
(ominous music)

1356
01:11:45,801 --> 01:11:48,429
- Like taking candy from a baby.

1357
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:52,141
(engine revs)

1358
01:12:10,618 --> 01:12:11,827
- Alice, Alice!

1359
01:12:14,413 --> 01:12:16,456
- What the hell
are you doing here?

1360
01:12:16,457 --> 01:12:17,707
- I need to talk to you.

1361
01:12:17,708 --> 01:12:19,167
- Ken, just let it go.

1362
01:12:19,168 --> 01:12:21,044
- You told me you didn't
have any brothers or sisters.

1363
01:12:21,045 --> 01:12:22,379
- What are you talking about?

1364
01:12:22,380 --> 01:12:23,671
- I just saw your brother.

1365
01:12:23,672 --> 01:12:25,007
Less than an hour
ago, at the club.

1366
01:12:25,008 --> 01:12:26,174
He was showing
your picture around

1367
01:12:26,175 --> 01:12:28,510
and asking questions about you.

1368
01:12:28,511 --> 01:12:29,344
- My God.

1369
01:12:29,345 --> 01:12:32,265
(lock clicks open)

1370
01:12:38,187 --> 01:12:39,187
- What is it?

1371
01:12:39,188 --> 01:12:40,022
What's going on?

1372
01:12:40,023 --> 01:12:41,689
Why are you so afraid?

1373
01:12:41,690 --> 01:12:43,400
- You should have
stayed out of it, Ken.

1374
01:12:43,401 --> 01:12:44,903
- He said your name was Lacey.

1375
01:12:45,987 --> 01:12:46,819
- It is.

1376
01:12:46,820 --> 01:12:48,238
- And he's your brother?

1377
01:12:48,239 --> 01:12:49,406
- He's not my brother.

1378
01:12:49,407 --> 01:12:50,698
He's a murderer.

1379
01:12:50,699 --> 01:12:52,034
He killed Heather's mother.

1380
01:12:52,035 --> 01:12:53,035
I saw him do it.

1381
01:12:53,036 --> 01:12:55,495
I'm in Witness Protection, Ken.

1382
01:12:55,496 --> 01:12:56,371
- What are you doing now?

1383
01:12:56,372 --> 01:12:57,664
Who are you calling?

1384
01:12:57,665 --> 01:12:59,082
- It's a beeper for
a Federal Marshall.

1385
01:12:59,083 --> 01:13:00,293
It's an emergency number.

1386
01:13:01,169 --> 01:13:02,420
He'll know I'm in trouble.

1387
01:13:09,593 --> 01:13:11,303
- Alice, Lacey, whatever.

1388
01:13:11,304 --> 01:13:13,263
If the police know,
then it's okay.

1389
01:13:13,264 --> 01:13:14,472
We just need to sit
tight and wait for them.

1390
01:13:14,473 --> 01:13:16,099
- It's too late, he's here.

1391
01:13:16,100 --> 01:13:16,976
He'll find me.

1392
01:13:22,898 --> 01:13:25,067
- Just wait for the police.

1393
01:13:25,068 --> 01:13:25,900
(shrieks)

1394
01:13:25,901 --> 01:13:26,901
(handgun fires)

1395
01:13:26,902 --> 01:13:30,864
(suspenseful orchestral music)

1396
01:13:42,043 --> 01:13:42,917
(guns firing)

1397
01:13:42,918 --> 01:13:45,295
(grunting)

1398
01:13:45,296 --> 01:13:47,839
(gun firing)

1399
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:49,424
- Oh, my God!

1400
01:13:49,425 --> 01:13:50,592
- I don't believe this.

1401
01:13:50,593 --> 01:13:52,010
I don't believe any of this.

1402
01:13:52,011 --> 01:13:53,261
- You've seen him.

1403
01:13:53,262 --> 01:13:54,179
Now he's gonna be
after you, too.

1404
01:13:54,180 --> 01:13:55,973
- All right, how can I help?

1405
01:13:55,974 --> 01:13:58,933
- Do you know who
Heather's boyfriend was?

1406
01:13:58,934 --> 01:14:00,435
- No.

1407
01:14:00,436 --> 01:14:02,312
- She wrote that on the last
night you were all in Stowe,

1408
01:14:02,313 --> 01:14:03,981
she got a call from a boyfriend.

1409
01:14:03,982 --> 01:14:05,607
You don't know who it was?

1410
01:14:05,608 --> 01:14:07,942
- Yeah, there was a call, but
it wasn't from the boyfriend.

1411
01:14:07,943 --> 01:14:10,820
It was somebody warning
her about the guy.

1412
01:14:10,821 --> 01:14:12,572
- She didn't mention a name?

1413
01:14:12,573 --> 01:14:14,699
- Uh, Holman or
something like that.

1414
01:14:14,700 --> 01:14:17,535
- Man, the word man was
in there, somewhere?

1415
01:14:17,536 --> 01:14:19,704
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, I think so.

1416
01:14:19,705 --> 01:14:23,833
Uh, Holman, uh, Hoffman.

1417
01:14:23,834 --> 01:14:25,544
The guy's name was Hoffman.

1418
01:14:31,967 --> 01:14:33,510
- Get yourself to the
nearest police station.

1419
01:14:33,511 --> 01:14:35,053
Tell them what's going on.

1420
01:14:35,054 --> 01:14:38,015
Tell them to contact a cop
named Sloane in New York.

1421
01:14:38,016 --> 01:14:40,017
He'll explain everything.

1422
01:14:40,018 --> 01:14:40,850
- Come on!

1423
01:14:40,851 --> 01:14:41,685
Move it!

1424
01:14:55,324 --> 01:14:57,576
- I need the next
flight out to New York.

1425
01:15:00,038 --> 01:15:02,830
No, wait, what do
you have for Boston?

1426
01:15:02,831 --> 01:15:05,542
- I have a flight leaving
for Boston in 12 minutes.

1427
01:15:05,543 --> 01:15:07,045
- That'll be fine.

1428
01:15:14,468 --> 01:15:15,385
Thanks.

1429
01:15:15,386 --> 01:15:19,014
(ominous orchestral music)

1430
01:15:21,850 --> 01:15:23,519
Detective Sloane, please.

1431
01:15:25,854 --> 01:15:27,689
(phone rings)

1432
01:15:27,690 --> 01:15:28,523
- Hello.

1433
01:15:28,524 --> 01:15:29,691
- Sloane, it's me.

1434
01:15:29,692 --> 01:15:32,235
He shot at the Marshall,
Marshall Svenson.

1435
01:15:32,236 --> 01:15:33,361
- Yeah, I know.

1436
01:15:33,362 --> 01:15:34,862
He's in the hospital,
he'll be okay.

1437
01:15:34,863 --> 01:15:37,115
Listen, you gotta get
yourself to a police station.

1438
01:15:37,116 --> 01:15:38,408
- No way.

1439
01:15:38,409 --> 01:15:40,034
- How else are they
gonna protect you?

1440
01:15:40,035 --> 01:15:43,538
- They're all doing such a
good job protecting me so far.

1441
01:15:43,539 --> 01:15:45,165
- What are you gonna do?

1442
01:15:45,166 --> 01:15:46,499
- I'm coming home.

1443
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:47,417
- All right, I'll meet ya.

1444
01:15:47,418 --> 01:15:49,545
- I'll call you when I get in.

1445
01:15:53,424 --> 01:15:56,134
(ominous orchestral music)

1446
01:15:56,135 --> 01:15:57,302
- Lacey!

1447
01:15:57,303 --> 01:15:58,511
Lacey!

1448
01:15:58,512 --> 01:16:00,597
- That gives me what,
like half an hour?

1449
01:16:00,598 --> 01:16:01,432
Thank you, here.

1450
01:16:10,816 --> 01:16:11,650
Excuse me.

1451
01:16:13,902 --> 01:16:14,737
It's me.

1452
01:16:15,738 --> 01:16:16,572
She's on the run.

1453
01:16:18,366 --> 01:16:19,532
Her weak point's her family.

1454
01:16:19,533 --> 01:16:21,369
Trust me, she's running
home to New York.

1455
01:16:22,578 --> 01:16:24,746
Yeah, I'll call
you when I get in.

1456
01:16:24,747 --> 01:16:28,416
(ominous orchestral music)

1457
01:16:28,417 --> 01:16:29,252
Thank you.

1458
01:16:35,090 --> 01:16:37,676
(techno music)

1459
01:16:49,104 --> 01:16:51,899
- Lacey Farrell is on
her way back to the city.

1460
01:16:53,108 --> 01:16:54,567
Now, every minute
she's on her own,

1461
01:16:54,568 --> 01:16:56,986
she's a walking target
for a professional killer.

1462
01:16:56,987 --> 01:16:58,613
At the present, all we can do

1463
01:16:58,614 --> 01:17:01,616
is cover her known
contacts here in the city.

1464
01:17:01,617 --> 01:17:04,494
These are composite
photos of David Blake.

1465
01:17:04,495 --> 01:17:06,454
He's been known
to use disguises,

1466
01:17:06,455 --> 01:17:08,165
so be cautious of anybody

1467
01:17:08,166 --> 01:17:10,625
approaching the
surveillance police.

1468
01:17:10,626 --> 01:17:13,711
The file's here,
hand out assignments.

1469
01:17:13,712 --> 01:17:16,549
(officers murmur)

1470
01:17:20,511 --> 01:17:21,637
Call me, huh?

1471
01:17:28,977 --> 01:17:31,730
(car horn beeps)

1472
01:17:33,691 --> 01:17:35,317
- Tim, I don't know how
to thank you for this.

1473
01:17:35,318 --> 01:17:37,569
- Ms. Farrell, it's nothing.

1474
01:17:37,570 --> 01:17:38,861
Look, I heard what
you went through

1475
01:17:38,862 --> 01:17:40,905
after Mrs. Greco's murder.

1476
01:17:40,906 --> 01:17:41,989
(sighing)

1477
01:17:41,990 --> 01:17:43,825
You need to catch a break here.

1478
01:17:43,826 --> 01:17:45,410
- You got that
right, look at me.

1479
01:17:45,411 --> 01:17:47,078
- Mr. Greco gave
orders that no one

1480
01:17:47,079 --> 01:17:48,288
was to show this apartment,

1481
01:17:48,289 --> 01:17:49,581
ever since Mrs. Greco's death.

1482
01:17:49,582 --> 01:17:51,333
Now, you should be safe here

1483
01:17:51,334 --> 01:17:53,000
for a couple of weeks, at least.

1484
01:17:53,001 --> 01:17:55,837
- Hopefully, what I have
to do won't take that long.

1485
01:17:55,838 --> 01:17:57,004
(sighing)

1486
01:17:57,005 --> 01:17:59,090
- Are you sure
you'll be all right?

1487
01:17:59,091 --> 01:18:00,925
- I'll be fine, thank you.

1488
01:18:00,926 --> 01:18:01,760
- Okay.

1489
01:18:06,139 --> 01:18:07,807

01:19:07,785 --> 01:19:09,076
- Greco.

1501
01:19:09,077 --> 01:19:10,788
- [Lacey] Mr. Greco,
it's Lacey Farrell.

1502
01:19:11,664 --> 01:19:12,789
- Ms. Farrell, we have to talk.

1503
01:19:12,790 --> 01:19:14,040
Where are you?

1504
01:19:14,041 --> 01:19:17,669
- I can't tell you, and
I can't talk for long.

1505
01:19:17,670 --> 01:19:18,920
I found out something new

1506
01:19:18,921 --> 01:19:20,422
about your wife and
daughter's murders.

1507
01:19:20,423 --> 01:19:21,923
- Go ahead, I'm listening.

1508
01:19:21,924 --> 01:19:24,258
- It has something to do
with a man called Hoffman.

1509
01:19:24,259 --> 01:19:26,303
- John Hoffman worked
for me at the restaurant

1510
01:19:26,304 --> 01:19:27,554
for 20 years.

1511
01:19:27,555 --> 01:19:29,263
He quit just after
Heather's death.

1512
01:19:29,264 --> 01:19:30,557
- I need to speak to him.

1513
01:19:30,558 --> 01:19:32,016
- You can't, he's dead.

1514
01:19:32,017 --> 01:19:34,811
(dramatic orchestral music)

1515
01:19:34,812 --> 01:19:35,978
- Was he married?

1516
01:19:35,979 --> 01:19:38,356
- His widow still lives
at the same place.

1517
01:19:38,357 --> 01:19:40,526
- Mr. Greco, I need the address.

1518
01:19:42,152 --> 01:19:44,363
- Two Adams Place, and
her name is Denise.

1519
01:19:46,490 --> 01:19:47,616
Hello, hello?

1520
01:19:53,246 --> 01:19:54,790
- What was all that about?

1521
01:19:55,999 --> 01:19:58,292
- I don't know, I just
know that Farrell girl

1522
01:19:58,293 --> 01:19:59,251
got herself into more trouble

1523
01:19:59,252 --> 01:20:00,796
than she can possibly know.

1524
01:20:20,483 --> 01:20:21,358
- Thanks.

1525
01:20:21,359 --> 01:20:22,192
- Thanks.

1526
01:20:33,245 --> 01:20:34,662
(phone rings)

1527
01:20:34,663 --> 01:20:35,663
- [Sloane] Detective Sloane.

1528
01:20:35,664 --> 01:20:36,498
- Sloane?

1529
01:20:36,499 --> 01:20:37,749
- Where are you?

1530
01:20:37,750 --> 01:20:38,708
- Sloane, I think
I'm on to something.

1531
01:20:38,709 --> 01:20:40,293
- Where the hell are you?

1532
01:20:41,462 --> 01:20:43,671
- I'm going to see
someone who might know

1533
01:20:43,672 --> 01:20:45,297
who Heather Greco was seeing

1534
01:20:45,298 --> 01:20:46,758
at the time of her death.

1535
01:20:46,759 --> 01:20:48,760
The man she was so afraid of.

1536
01:20:48,761 --> 01:20:50,512
- Lacey, you're a
target out there.

1537
01:20:50,513 --> 01:20:51,638
Let us help you.

1538
01:20:51,639 --> 01:20:54,181
- I have to do it this way.

1539
01:20:54,182 --> 01:20:56,351
As soon as I get what
I need, I'll call you.

1540
01:20:57,269 --> 01:20:58,352
(dial tone humming)

1541
01:20:58,353 --> 01:21:00,938
(dramatic orchestral music)

1542
01:21:00,939 --> 01:21:02,815
- Yeah, I just received
a call on this line.

1543
01:21:02,816 --> 01:21:04,984
I need the location
of the caller.

1544
01:21:04,985 --> 01:21:06,612
Yeah, I think it
was a pay phone.

1545
01:21:11,450 --> 01:21:13,201
All right, thank you.

1546
01:21:14,787 --> 01:21:17,039
Come on, we're on the move!

1547
01:21:27,466 --> 01:21:30,384
(knocking on door)

1548
01:21:30,385 --> 01:21:32,386
(locks click)

1549
01:21:32,387 --> 01:21:33,721
- Can I help you?

1550
01:21:33,722 --> 01:21:36,223
- Mrs. Hoffman, my
name is Lacey Farrell.

1551
01:21:36,224 --> 01:21:37,892
- Yes, what's this about?

1552
01:21:37,893 --> 01:21:39,185
- I need to talk to you

1553
01:21:39,186 --> 01:21:41,395
about your husband
and Heather Greco.

1554
01:21:41,396 --> 01:21:42,897
- I have nothing to say to you.

1555
01:21:42,898 --> 01:21:45,567
- Please, Mrs. Hoffman, I
don't mean you any harm.

1556
01:21:45,568 --> 01:21:47,234
I just need some information.

1557
01:21:47,235 --> 01:21:48,653
- I don't know anything.

1558
01:21:48,654 --> 01:21:49,904
I don't want to know anything.

1559
01:21:49,905 --> 01:21:51,072
You have to go.

1560
01:21:51,073 --> 01:21:53,115
- I have nowhere to go.

1561
01:21:53,116 --> 01:21:54,659
Someone is trying to kill me.

1562
01:21:54,660 --> 01:21:56,661
And I think it's the same person

1563
01:21:56,662 --> 01:21:59,371
who killed Heather
and Chantal Greco.

1564
01:21:59,372 --> 01:22:01,332
- They killed my husband, too.

1565
01:22:01,333 --> 01:22:03,084
All because of the Grecos.

1566
01:22:03,085 --> 01:22:04,461
I don't wanna die.

1567
01:22:04,462 --> 01:22:06,378
- This has to stop, and I think

1568
01:22:06,379 --> 01:22:08,255
you are the person
who can make it stop.

1569
01:22:08,256 --> 01:22:09,382
Please, help me.

1570
01:22:17,808 --> 01:22:19,934
(lock clicks)

1571
01:22:19,935 --> 01:22:21,895
- Come in and sit down.

1572
01:22:25,899 --> 01:22:29,778
(suspenseful orchestral music)

1573
01:22:38,996 --> 01:22:41,205
John worked as the
maitre d' for Jimmy Greco

1574
01:22:41,206 --> 01:22:43,374
for over 20 years.

1575
01:22:43,375 --> 01:22:45,167
He loved Jimmy like a brother

1576
01:22:45,168 --> 01:22:47,713
and Heather Greco like
she was his own daughter.

1577
01:22:48,964 --> 01:22:50,297
- What happened?

1578
01:22:50,298 --> 01:22:51,634
- Business was changing.

1579
01:22:52,843 --> 01:22:54,135
John felt that,
with Jimmy trying

1580
01:22:54,136 --> 01:22:55,803
to get the casino
off of the ground,

1581
01:22:55,804 --> 01:22:57,972
he was losing sight
of the restaurant,

1582
01:22:57,973 --> 01:23:00,266
and also felt that Jimmy
was getting himself involved

1583
01:23:00,267 --> 01:23:01,893
with the wrong crowd.

1584
01:23:01,894 --> 01:23:04,395
- Who, his investors?

1585
01:23:04,396 --> 01:23:06,649
- I don't know, John
wouldn't tell me.

1586
01:23:08,066 --> 01:23:11,277
All he said was to keep my
mouth shut and stay out of it.

1587
01:23:11,278 --> 01:23:14,155
He said whoever it
was was too dangerous.

1588
01:23:14,156 --> 01:23:15,072
(suspenseful orchestral music)

1589
01:23:15,073 --> 01:23:17,743
(car screeches)

1590
01:23:21,664 --> 01:23:23,290
- Yeah, this is it!

1591
01:23:24,792 --> 01:23:25,917
There's a lot of houses here.

1592
01:23:25,918 --> 01:23:27,376
We can't cover all of them.

1593
01:23:27,377 --> 01:23:28,586
- All right, I'll
call for backup.

1594
01:23:28,587 --> 01:23:29,797
We'll canvas the
whole neighborhood.

1595
01:23:32,883 --> 01:23:34,009
- Please think.

1596
01:23:35,177 --> 01:23:37,094
Is there anything else
your husband mentioned

1597
01:23:37,095 --> 01:23:37,930
about this man?

1598
01:23:39,514 --> 01:23:43,350
- Nothing, just that it
was someone close to Jimmy,

1599
01:23:43,351 --> 01:23:45,688
the last person Jimmy
would ever suspect.

1600
01:23:48,440 --> 01:23:52,610
- My God, it all makes sense.

1601
01:23:52,611 --> 01:23:55,030
It's why Heather kept the
relationship a secret.

1602
01:23:56,531 --> 01:23:58,325
Excuse me, I need
to use your phone.

1603
01:24:09,587 --> 01:24:10,712
(gasping)

1604
01:24:10,713 --> 01:24:13,131
(clattering)

1605
01:24:14,299 --> 01:24:15,968
Is there anyone
else living here?

1606
01:24:23,475 --> 01:24:24,892
(Mrs. Hoffman screams)

1607
01:24:24,893 --> 01:24:28,229
(suspenseful orchestral music)

1608
01:24:28,230 --> 01:24:29,981
(gun firing)

1609
01:24:29,982 --> 01:24:32,566
(screams)

1610
01:24:32,567 --> 01:24:33,401
- Run!

1611
01:24:42,077 --> 01:24:42,910
(gun clatters)

1612
01:24:42,911 --> 01:24:44,245
Nah, nah, nah!

1613
01:24:44,246 --> 01:24:47,498
- [Sloane] Don't make
this hard on yourself.

1614
01:24:47,499 --> 01:24:48,667
Give it to me.

1615
01:24:49,877 --> 01:24:51,252
- Get up!

1616
01:24:51,253 --> 01:24:53,587
(shouts)

1617
01:24:53,588 --> 01:24:54,422
Let's go!

1618
01:24:57,259 --> 01:24:58,093
Come on.

1619
01:25:04,516 --> 01:25:05,768
Move it, Blake.

1620
01:25:10,563 --> 01:25:11,689
- It's all over now.

1621
01:25:11,690 --> 01:25:14,442
- It's not over,
Sloane, not yet.

1622
01:25:36,965 --> 01:25:39,467
(lock clicks)

1623
01:25:50,854 --> 01:25:51,854
- All this time, I
didn't even think

1624
01:25:51,855 --> 01:25:53,981
you knew the combination.

1625
01:25:53,982 --> 01:25:55,983
You know the funny thing, Steve.

1626
01:25:55,984 --> 01:26:00,237
I would have given you
anything you wanted, anything.

1627
01:26:00,238 --> 01:26:04,784
You didn't have to kill
my little girl for it.

1628
01:26:04,785 --> 01:26:06,744
(laughs)

1629
01:26:06,745 --> 01:26:09,872
- Jimmy, you got it all wrong.

1630
01:26:09,873 --> 01:26:12,083
I was just coming up for a file.

1631
01:26:12,084 --> 01:26:13,250
I noticed the safe was open.

1632
01:26:13,251 --> 01:26:14,460
I was just making sure

1633
01:26:14,461 --> 01:26:15,336
the receipts were all
right, that's all.

1634
01:26:15,337 --> 01:26:16,670
- Don't waste a breath.

1635
01:26:16,671 --> 01:26:19,006
I just got a call
from the Farrell girl.

1636
01:26:19,007 --> 01:26:20,467
She told me it was you.

1637
01:26:21,468 --> 01:26:22,927
I didn't want to believe it.

1638
01:26:22,928 --> 01:26:24,721
But then I called the
partners in Atlantic City.

1639
01:26:24,722 --> 01:26:26,222
They said they'd given advances

1640
01:26:26,223 --> 01:26:27,724
they'd never gotten
receipts for.

1641
01:26:27,725 --> 01:26:31,018
They told me you handled the
transactions and told them

1642
01:26:31,019 --> 01:26:33,855
that I was too busy
to deal with it.

1643
01:26:33,856 --> 01:26:35,190
- You were too busy, Jimmy.

1644
01:26:36,399 --> 01:26:38,192
You're always too busy.

1645
01:26:38,193 --> 01:26:41,028
I carried the ball
for you, like always.

1646
01:26:41,029 --> 01:26:43,865
- Heather, and John, Chantal.

1647
01:26:43,866 --> 01:26:46,200
How many more would
you have killed, Steve?

1648
01:26:46,201 --> 01:26:47,494
You gonna kill me next?

1649
01:26:48,703 --> 01:26:49,661
- I'm outta here.

1650
01:26:49,662 --> 01:26:52,581
(suspenseful orchestral music)

1651
01:26:52,582 --> 01:26:54,835
(grunting)

1652
01:27:00,883 --> 01:27:02,884
(grunting)

1653
01:27:02,885 --> 01:27:03,718
- Enough!

1654
01:27:04,845 --> 01:27:07,347
(sirens wail)

1655
01:27:09,307 --> 01:27:13,102
(peaceful piano music)

1656
01:27:13,103 --> 01:27:15,938
Well, here we are, door to door.

1657
01:27:15,939 --> 01:27:17,107
How's that for service?

1658
01:27:18,859 --> 01:27:22,695
- I'm home, I'm really home.

1659
01:27:25,157 --> 01:27:27,408
(sighing)

1660
01:27:27,409 --> 01:27:29,202
I can hardly believe it's over.

1661
01:27:30,788 --> 01:27:33,122
I can hardly believe
I have my life back.

1662
01:27:33,123 --> 01:27:34,373
- Well, it wouldn't've happened

1663
01:27:34,374 --> 01:27:35,500
if you hadn't put
the pieces together.

1664
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:41,381
- I guess, I just, I just
keep thinking about Blake.

1665
01:27:43,258 --> 01:27:46,635
He never would've given up
coming after me, would he?

1666
01:27:46,636 --> 01:27:49,639
- No, no, no, guys like him
don't stop till the job is done.

1667
01:27:50,849 --> 01:27:52,767
- Do you think they'll
put him away forever?

1668
01:27:54,186 --> 01:27:56,312
(sighs)

1669
01:27:56,313 --> 01:27:57,814
What?

1670
01:27:57,815 --> 01:28:00,524
- Baldwin's already
made a deal with him.

1671
01:28:00,525 --> 01:28:02,318
Everything he knows
about Steve Smith

1672
01:28:02,319 --> 01:28:04,946
and his connections
in Atlantic City,

1673
01:28:04,947 --> 01:28:06,197
in exchange for a trip

1674
01:28:06,198 --> 01:28:07,991
through the Witness
Protection program.

1675
01:28:08,951 --> 01:28:10,492
- Great.

1676
01:28:10,493 --> 01:28:12,370
Do you think they'll give
him my old apartment?

1677
01:28:13,788 --> 01:28:16,208
- For guys like Baldwin,
the whole thing is a deal.

1678
01:28:17,625 --> 01:28:19,502
You know it's just another
step to the Governor's office.

1679
01:28:20,628 --> 01:28:22,171
How about you?

1680
01:28:22,172 --> 01:28:24,673
You gonna go back
into real estate, or--

1681
01:28:24,674 --> 01:28:25,508
- I guess so,

1682
01:28:27,469 --> 01:28:30,138
it's what I do, it's
what I'm good at.

1683
01:28:32,307 --> 01:28:35,434
But I was thinking I might
make a trip to Minneapolis.

1684
01:28:35,435 --> 01:28:37,394
See how Marshall
Svenson is doing.

1685
01:28:37,395 --> 01:28:39,021
- Oh, he's doing
great, doing great.

1686
01:28:39,022 --> 01:28:41,023
Thanks to that
bullet-proof vest.

1687
01:28:41,024 --> 01:28:42,067
- Oh, thank goodness.

1688
01:28:43,068 --> 01:28:44,861
And there are a few people there

1689
01:28:44,862 --> 01:28:49,073
who I'd like to
meet all over again.

1690
01:28:49,074 --> 01:28:51,326
As Lacey Farrell, this time.

1691
01:28:56,039 --> 01:28:56,874
Thank you.

1692
01:28:59,001 --> 01:29:02,378
Thank you, Sloane for
never giving up on me.

1693
01:29:02,379 --> 01:29:05,298
- Oh, come on, all
in a day's work.

1694
01:29:12,264 --> 01:29:13,639
No, that's all right.

1695
01:29:13,640 --> 01:29:15,182
I know the way out.

1696
01:29:15,183 --> 01:29:18,561
(light orchestral music)

1697
01:29:37,247 --> 01:29:39,249
(sighs)

1698
01:29:45,713 --> 01:29:49,176
(light orchestral music)

1699
01:30:01,396 --> 01:30:03,022
(all chattering)

1700
01:30:03,023 --> 01:30:04,231
- [Kit] What is that?

1701
01:30:04,232 --> 01:30:06,233
- [Bonnie] Mom, mom,
look what I got?

1702
01:30:06,234 --> 01:30:07,068
It looks so cool.

1703
01:30:07,069 --> 01:30:08,527
- Oh, my goodness.

1704
01:30:08,528 --> 01:30:11,405
(chimes ringing)

1705
01:30:11,406 --> 01:30:12,240
- Lacey!

1706
01:30:13,616 --> 01:30:14,742
- Aunt Lacey!

1707
01:30:16,369 --> 01:30:18,413
(laughs)

1708
01:30:24,419 --> 01:30:27,547
I knew you wouldn't
miss my birthday.

1709
01:30:38,933 --> 01:30:43,145
♪ Pretend you don't
see her, my heart ♪

1710
01:30:43,146 --> 01:30:44,356
- Welcome back.

1711
01:30:46,274 --> 01:30:51,238

coming our way ♪

1712
01:30:53,781 --> 01:30:58,286
