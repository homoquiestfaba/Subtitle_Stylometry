AT OUR COUSIN'S BACKYARD
TO THE NORTH.

172
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:44,245
OUR BIG, DUMB COUSIN,
CANADA.

173
00:08:44,278 --> 00:08:45,947
IT'S KIND OF LIKE
VISITING THE FAMILY.

174
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:47,215
IT'S KIND OF
AN OBLIGATION.

175
00:08:47,248 --> 00:08:51,219
GOTTA REMIND THESE CANADIANS
WHO'S BOSS.

176
00:08:51,252 --> 00:08:52,720
[coughs]

177
00:08:55,089 --> 00:08:59,594
THIS ISN'T A ROAST,
IT'S A THAW.

178
00:08:59,627 --> 00:09:01,462
MY [bleep] IS INSIDE MY STOMACH
RIGHT NOW,

179
00:09:01,495 --> 00:09:04,098
IT'S SO COLD OUT THERE.

180
00:09:04,131 --> 00:09:06,734
UH, I WATCHED A CANADIAN
PORNO MOVIE YESTERDAY.

181
00:09:06,767 --> 00:09:07,969
THAT WAS COOL.

182
00:09:08,002 --> 00:09:12,640
TWO GIRLS,
ONE STANLEY CUP.

183
00:09:12,673 --> 00:09:14,508
LAST TIME
I WAS IN MONTREAL,

184
00:09:14,542 --> 00:09:18,312
CELINE DION HAD JUST GIVEN BIRTH
TO IDENTICAL TWINS,

185
00:09:18,346 --> 00:09:22,550
WHICH WAS QUITE AN ACHIEVEMENT
GIVEN HER AGE AND FACE.

186
00:09:27,021 --> 00:09:32,159
TOO SOON
FOR THE CELINE DION JOKES?

187
00:09:32,193 --> 00:09:35,897
THERE GOES
MY MICHAEL J. FOX ROUTINE.

188
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:37,798
I'M NOT MAKING FUN
OF MICHAEL J. FOX.

189
00:09:37,832 --> 00:09:41,903
THAT'S SHAKY GROUND
RIGHT THERE.

190
00:09:44,138 --> 00:09:45,373
[laughs]

191
00:09:45,406 --> 00:09:46,974
OH, MY--HEY,
HOW ABOUT A HAND FOR THE BAND,

192
00:09:47,008 --> 00:09:52,547
DOING A GREAT JOB TONIGHT.

193
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:55,850
IF YOU'RE PREGNANT
OR WEIRD-LOOKING,

194
00:09:55,883 --> 00:09:58,519
YOU HAVE AN OBLIGATION
TO YOUR FELLOW CANADIANS

195
00:09:58,553 --> 00:10:00,821
TO COME ONSTAGE RIGHT NOW.

196
00:10:00,855 --> 00:10:02,290
ALL RIGHT,
THAT'S PROBABLY GOOD.

197
00:10:02,323 --> 00:10:05,293
WOW, THIS IS WORKING OUT.
COME ON.

198
00:10:05,326 --> 00:10:07,194
HOLY SHIT,
LET'S TALK TO THIS GUY.

199
00:10:07,228 --> 00:10:09,964
COME OVER HERE, SIR.

200
00:10:09,997 --> 00:10:11,866
SIR, WHEN I ASKED FOR PREGNANT
PEOPLE TO COME ONSTAGE,

201
00:10:11,899 --> 00:10:14,302
I WASN'T TRYING TO
REFER TO YOU,

202
00:10:14,335 --> 00:10:16,837
BUT--COME HERE.
COME HERE, DOLL.

203
00:10:16,871 --> 00:10:19,840
LET'S JUST--
LET'S JUST COMPARE YOU TWO.

204
00:10:19,874 --> 00:10:23,644
YOU GUYS ARE--JUST RUB BELLIES.
JUST RUB BELLIES A LITTLE BIT.

205
00:10:23,678 --> 00:10:27,982
THE THREE OF US.
THE THREE OF US.

206
00:10:28,015 --> 00:10:29,917
YOU GUYS ARE ALL SO CUTE.

207
00:10:29,951 --> 00:10:31,619
COME HERE, HOW YOU DOING?
- GOOD, HOW ARE YOU?

208
00:10:31,652 --> 00:10:32,920
- WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
- AMANDA.

209
00:10:32,954 --> 00:10:36,224
- AMANDA. YOU ARE SO
SEXILY PREGNANT RIGHT NOW.

210
00:10:36,257 --> 00:10:38,292
- THANKS.
- WHO'S THE BABY DADDY?

211
00:10:38,326 --> 00:10:41,829
- HE'S OUT THERE.

212
00:10:41,862 --> 00:10:45,666
- THIS WOMAN IS TOO PREGNANT
TO BE OUT IN PUBLIC RIGHT NOW.

213
00:10:45,766 --> 00:10:47,668
I'M SO H--CAN I TOUCH?
- YEAH, GO AHEAD.

214
00:10:47,768 --> 00:10:48,769
- DO YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE HAVING?

215
00:10:48,803 --> 00:10:50,771
- A BOY.
- OH, THAT'S AWESOME.

216
00:10:50,771 --> 00:10:52,206
I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE
BECAUSE THEY SAY

217
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,609
IT'S VERY HEALTHY
FOR THE BABY'S DEVELOPMENT

218
00:10:54,642 --> 00:10:57,211
TO HEAR PEOPLE LAUGHING,
TO HEAR THE MOTHER LAUGHING.

219
00:10:57,245 --> 00:10:58,479
- THAT'S RIGHT.

220
00:10:58,512 --> 00:11:02,116
- IMAGINE IF I WAS
LICKING YOUR [bleep] RIGHT NOW,

221
00:11:02,149 --> 00:11:07,288
HOW GOOD THAT WOULD BE
FOR THE UNBORN BABY.

222
00:11:07,321 --> 00:11:08,556
WHAT DO YOU SAY?
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

223
00:11:08,589 --> 00:11:10,892
- SURE.
[laughs]

224
00:11:10,925 --> 00:11:13,895
- MMM, I GOTTA JERK OFF AGAIN.
HOLD ON A SECOND.

225
00:11:13,928 --> 00:11:15,196
[laughs]

226
00:11:15,229 --> 00:11:17,265
OH, I DON'T EVEN KNOW.
COME HERE.

227
00:11:17,298 --> 00:11:19,433
YOU ARE SO--
LOOK AT YOU.

228
00:11:19,467 --> 00:11:21,068
WOW, YOU LOOK LIKE YOU WERE
[bleep] RAPED

229
00:11:21,102 --> 00:11:22,203
ON THE WAY HERE.

230
00:11:22,236 --> 00:11:25,039
WHAT HAPPENED
TO THIS [bleep] OUTFIT?

231
00:11:25,072 --> 00:11:28,042
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

232
00:11:28,075 --> 00:11:30,444
DID YOU MAKE IT IN OKAY?
WHAT HAPPENED, EXACTLY?

233
00:11:30,478 --> 00:11:34,916
THEY RIPPED YOUR--
HALF YOUR DRESS OFF.

234
00:11:34,949 --> 00:11:36,384
I WANT TO BITE YOUR SHOULDER
RIGHT NOW.

235
00:11:36,417 --> 00:11:37,618
- YOU'RE A CREEP.

236
00:11:37,652 --> 00:11:38,953
- WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
- SARAH.

237
00:11:38,986 --> 00:11:40,354
- SARAH WITH AN "H"?
- YES.

238
00:11:40,388 --> 00:11:44,759
- OH, I GOTTA JERK OFF.

239
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:46,294
WHAT DO YOU DO
ALL DAY, SARAH?

240
00:11:46,327 --> 00:11:47,461
- A STUDENT.
- OH, YEAH?

241
00:11:47,495 --> 00:11:49,597
OF WHAT?
- MBA.

242
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:52,099
- I KNOW
IT'S NOT FASHION.

243
00:11:52,133 --> 00:11:54,835
all: OH!

244
00:11:54,869 --> 00:11:56,404
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY, SARAH.

245
00:11:56,437 --> 00:11:58,539
YOU'RE HERE
AMONGST FRIENDS TODAY.

246
00:11:58,573 --> 00:12:01,876
MISS, IT WAS GREAT
TO MEET YOU.

247
00:12:01,909 --> 00:12:03,678
HONEY, I'LL SEE YOU--WHEN?
WHEN WILL I SEE YOU?

248
00:12:03,778 --> 00:12:05,680
- AFTER THE SHOW.
- AFTER THE SHOW?

249
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:11,085
DO YOU EVER SUCK [bleep]
FOR COKE?

250
00:12:11,118 --> 00:12:15,523
HOW ABOUT DIET PEPSI?
DO YOU TAKE DIET PEPSI?

251
00:12:15,556 --> 00:12:17,959
MAMALA, THANK YOU
FOR BEING A GOOD SPORT.

252
00:12:17,992 --> 00:12:19,160
- THANK YOU.
- THANK YOU FOR COMING UP HERE

253
00:12:19,193 --> 00:12:20,561
WHEN I ASKED FOR
A VOLUNTEER.

254
00:12:20,595 --> 00:12:25,466
GOOD LUCK WITH YOUR BABY
AND YOUR DADDY.

255
00:12:25,499 --> 00:12:26,601
OH, THAT WAS SO FUN.

256
00:12:28,537 --> 00:12:32,708
- WASHINGTON, D.C. HAS
A REPUTATION FOR BEING UPTIGHT.

257
00:12:32,741 --> 00:12:35,778
THAT WASN'T THE CASE WITH
THE PEOPLE I WAS RUNNING INTO.

258
00:12:35,811 --> 00:12:37,446
HEY, HONEST ABE!

259
00:12:37,479 --> 00:12:40,115
WANT TO COME HEAR ME
ROAST ABE LINCOLN?

260
00:12:40,149 --> 00:12:41,517
LAST TIME I ROASTED
SOMEBODY THIS STONED,

261
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:45,221
IT WAS CHARLIE SHEEN.

262
00:12:45,254 --> 00:12:47,323
ABE, YOU WERE AMERICA'S
BEST PRESIDENT EVER,

263
00:12:47,356 --> 00:12:50,226
AND OUR
WORST THEATERGOER EVER.

264
00:12:50,259 --> 00:12:51,894
- TOO SOON, TOO SOON.

265
00:12:51,927 --> 00:12:53,829
- TOO SOON?
 all: TOO SOON.

266
00:12:53,862 --> 00:12:55,097
- I HEARD THAT PLAY
WAS SO BAD,

267
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:56,899
HE WAS HOPING
TO GET SHOT IN THE HEAD.

268
00:12:56,932 --> 00:12:58,033
[laughter and groans]

269
00:12:58,067 --> 00:13:00,135
TOO SOON,
TOO SOON, TOO SOON.

270
00:13:00,169 --> 00:13:02,705
OF COURSE,
ABE LINCOLN FREED THE SLAVES.

271
00:13:02,738 --> 00:13:07,142
IS THAT WHY ALL BLACK PEOPLE
DRIVE LINCOLNS?

272
00:13:07,176 --> 00:13:09,144
NOW I'M GONNA GO ROAST
MARTIN LUTHER KING.

273
00:13:09,178 --> 00:13:11,580
COME ON!
- YEAH!

274
00:13:11,614 --> 00:13:13,349
- I HEARD THAT THEY
JUST APPROVED MEDICAL MARIJUANA

275
00:13:13,382 --> 00:13:16,852
HERE IN WASHINGTON TOO.
IS THAT TRUE?

276
00:13:16,886 --> 00:13:19,755
IT'LL BE
A BILLION-DOLLAR INDUSTRY.

277
00:13:19,788 --> 00:13:21,924
DOCTORS WILL START
ADVERTISING ON TV.

278
00:13:21,957 --> 00:13:27,963
"DO YOU HAVE TROUBLE
SLEEPING 12-14 HOURS A NIGHT?"

279
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:36,238
SOMETIMES I WAKE UP
AFTER NINE OR TEN HOURS.

280
00:13:36,272 --> 00:13:41,777
"ARE CARTOONS NOT AS FUNNY
AS THEY USED TO BE?"

281
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:43,045
WE'RE IN A POLITICAL AREA.

282
00:13:43,078 --> 00:13:45,314
DO YOU GUYS THINK, UH,
THE PRESIDENT

283
00:13:45,347 --> 00:13:46,682
SHOULD GET HIS JOB BACK?

284
00:13:46,782 --> 00:13:47,683
- NO!
[scattered boos]

285
00:13:47,783 --> 00:13:49,351
- REALLY?

286
00:13:49,385 --> 00:13:52,888
HE GETS A LOT OF CREDIT
FOR, UH, BEING ON THE LOOKOUT

287
00:13:52,922 --> 00:13:58,460
FOR OSAMA BIN LADEN AND KILLING
THAT MOTHER[bleep], RIGHT?

288
00:13:58,494 --> 00:14:02,264
OSAMA BIN LADEN, LIVING IN
THAT RUN-DOWN COMPOUND

289
00:14:02,298 --> 00:14:03,699
FOR YEARS

290
00:14:03,799 --> 00:14:06,869
WITH HIS 3 WIVES
AND 11 KIDS.

291
00:14:06,902 --> 00:14:08,871
I HAVE A THEORY
THAT OSAMA BIN LADEN

292
00:14:08,904 --> 00:14:12,241
CALLED THE NAVY SEALS
HIMSELF.

293
00:14:12,274 --> 00:14:16,645
"SOMEBODY [bleep] KILL ME

294
00:14:16,679 --> 00:14:19,882
"BEFORE I DO SOMETHING CRAZY.

295
00:14:19,915 --> 00:14:24,486
"I'M AT
1313 [gibberish] BOULEVARD,

296
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,588
"ABBOTTABAD.

A-A-A-B-B-B-A-A-

298
00:14:30,326 --> 00:14:34,830
B-B-B-A-A-B-A
AS IN AAH!

299
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:40,569
ANYBODY WHO WANTS TO
COME ONSTAGE.

300
00:14:40,603 --> 00:14:42,671
IT HAS TO BE
VOLUNTEER ONLY.

301
00:14:42,771 --> 00:14:45,774
THIS IS GONNA BE--
LOOK AT THIS GUY, WOW.

302
00:14:45,808 --> 00:14:51,113
YOU GOT [bleep] BALLS
FOR COMING OUT.

303
00:14:51,146 --> 00:14:53,782
THAT'S [bleep] AWESOME.

304
00:14:53,782 --> 00:14:57,853
YOU COULD STAY.
YOUR BUDDY COULD STAY.

305
00:14:57,887 --> 00:15:01,323
HOLY SHIT.
THIS IS TOO [bleep]--

306
00:15:01,357 --> 00:15:06,896
OH, MY GOD,
WHEN DID HAROLD [bleep] KUMAR?

307
00:15:06,929 --> 00:15:10,666
LOOK AT THIS, WE GOT THE [bleep]
BOB'S BIG BOY UP HERE.

308
00:15:10,699 --> 00:15:13,569
THE F--
[laughs]

309
00:15:13,602 --> 00:15:18,474
HOLY SHIT, YOU GOT
THE BIGGEST TITS UP HERE.

310
00:15:18,507 --> 00:15:19,909
WHAT'S UP, MAN, HOW YOU DOING?
- WHAT'S UP, BRO?

311
00:15:19,942 --> 00:15:21,243
- NICE TO SEE YOU, BUDDY.

312
00:15:21,277 --> 00:15:22,611
ARE YOU REALLY
ON THE REDSKINS?

313
00:15:22,645 --> 00:15:24,213
- DAMN RIGHT.

314
00:15:24,246 --> 00:15:25,548
- WHAT POSITION DO YOU PLAY?

315
00:15:25,581 --> 00:15:27,983
[bleep]... [laughs]

316
00:15:28,017 --> 00:15:31,086
BOTTOM?

317
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,621
YOU GOT BRASS BALLS
COMING UP HERE

318
00:15:32,655 --> 00:15:35,057
TO GET [bleep]
SPEED-ROASTED.

319
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:36,225
THIS GUY HAS SEEN
MORE LIFE EXPERIENCE

320
00:15:36,258 --> 00:15:37,359
THAN I'M EVER GONNA SEE

321
00:15:37,393 --> 00:15:38,794
OR MOST PEOPLE WILL EVER SEE
IN THEIR LIVES.

322
00:15:38,827 --> 00:15:41,163
I TALK SHIT FOR A LIVING.

323
00:15:41,196 --> 00:15:42,932
I LIVE IN A COUNTRY
WHERE FREE SPEECH

324
00:15:42,965 --> 00:15:45,067
IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING
TO ME.

325
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:47,903
SO THESE GUYS OVER HERE,

326
00:15:47,937 --> 00:15:50,773
AND THIS [bleep]
TOUGH MANIAC OVER HERE,

327
00:15:50,806 --> 00:15:54,143
PROTECTS MY RIGHT
FOR FREE SPEECH.

328
00:15:54,176 --> 00:15:58,180
[cheers and applause]
YEAH.

329
00:15:58,214 --> 00:16:01,150
YOU'RE THE FIRST PERSON
FROM THE HOSPITAL

330
00:16:01,183 --> 00:16:02,818
EVER TO COME UP ONSTAGE
DURING ONE OF MY SHOWS,

331
00:16:02,851 --> 00:16:05,821
AND HONESTLY, I DON'T KNOW WHAT
THE [bleep] HAPPENED TO YOU,

332
00:16:05,854 --> 00:16:08,791
BUT THIS IS A LONG WAY TO GO
TO LOSE WEIGHT.

333
00:16:08,824 --> 00:16:09,925
- I KNOW, RIGHT?

334
00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:12,361
- I HOPE YOU'RE HAVING
A [bleep] BLAST.

335
00:16:12,394 --> 00:16:14,363
- I DID, IN AFGHANISTAN.
- WHAT?

336
00:16:14,396 --> 00:16:16,065
- I SAID I DID HAVE A BLAST,
IN AFGHANISTAN.

337
