00:00:02,836 --> 00:00:05,304
Thanks for coming.
Would you like a receipt with that?

2
00:00:06,773 --> 00:00:08,138
Don't forget to take a mint.

3
00:00:11,578 --> 00:00:14,046
Thanks for coming.

4
00:00:14,114 --> 00:00:15,706
Don't forget to take a mint.

Thanks for coming.

6

Thanks for coming.
Would you like a receipt with that?

10
00:00:50,784 --> 00:00:51,944
Don't forget to...

11
00:00:55,522 --> 00:00:58,958
<i>Somebody,</i>
<i>I can't remember who it was,</i>

12
00:00:59,025 --> 00:01:02,961
<i>once said that every man's life</i>
<i>ends the same way.</i>

13
00:01:03,029 --> 00:01:06,328
<i>It's only the details</i>
<i>of how he lived and died</i>

14
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:09,027
<i>that distinguishes him</i>
<i>from the next guy.</i>

15
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:15,401
<i>... super waterbed blowout.</i>
<i>No mattress is...</i>

16
00:01:37,397 --> 00:01:38,887
<i>For most people nowadays,</i>

17
00:01:38,965 --> 00:01:41,331
<i>the American dream</i>
<i>doesn't really exist.</i>

18
00:01:42,335 --> 00:01:46,066
<i>For my friend, Ray Tuckby,</i>
<i>it was no different.</i>

19
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:11,594
<i>Trona, California, had to be about</i>
<i>the weirdest place I ever saw...</i>

20
00:02:12,999 --> 00:02:16,901
<i>like being on the moon</i>
<i>yet less than three hours from L.A.,</i>

21
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,598
<i>and it could get hot as hell...</i>

22
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,234
<i>in the summer,</i>
<i>up to 130.</i>

23
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:35,821
<i>At one time,</i>
<i>Trona was a town full of promise.</i>

24
00:02:38,558 --> 00:02:40,753
<i>That promise</i>
<i>had long been forgotten...</i>

25
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:44,797
<i>along with the movie theater,</i>
<i>the Ford dealership,</i>

26
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:46,126
<i>and the swimming hole.</i>

27
00:02:49,369 --> 00:02:51,929
<i>But it was still</i>
<i>where Ray called home.</i>

28
00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:03,705
<i>Now, home for most people</i>
<i>was a place of refuge.</i>

29
00:03:04,717 --> 00:03:06,708
<i>For Ray, it was anything but that.</i>

30
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,654
<i>In fact, it was just the opposite.</i>

31
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:13,225
Sixty for a sack.
You got three.

32
00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:14,419
All right.

33
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:15,756
What's it gonna cost?

34
00:03:17,297 --> 00:03:18,662
Hold on a second there, Ray.

35
00:03:22,101 --> 00:03:23,090
All right.

36
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:28,704
Afternoon there, Dirk.

37
00:03:28,775 --> 00:03:30,208
You're late on the rent, Ray.

38
00:03:30,276 --> 00:03:31,334
Really?

39
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:33,003
Damn, Dirk.
Sorry about that.

40
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:35,912
I'll fly a check on over to you
as soon as I get cleaned up.

41
00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:38,007
Don't make a habit out of it.

42
00:03:38,084 --> 00:03:39,517
You know I got a short temper.

43
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:49,387
<i>It was pretty much the same routine</i>
<i>day in and day out for Ray...</i>

44
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:53,194
<i>punch in at 9:00, out at 5:00.</i>

45
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:58,928
<i>By 5:30, he'd arrive</i>
<i>at his house on Cyril Street...</i>

46
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:04,136
<i>and every day, the welcome wagon</i>
<i>was there to greet him.</i>

47
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:08,107
You! Ray!

48
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:10,742
Oh, howdy, Selma.

49
00:04:10,817 --> 00:04:13,615
You might want to think about
cleanin' up your yard.

50
00:04:13,686 --> 00:04:17,053
Goddamn turtle
turned this place into a shithole.

51
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:25,022
Sure thing, Selma.
I'll get on it over the weekend.

52
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:27,999
You think you're such a big shot,
Mr. Something Special?

53
00:04:28,067 --> 00:04:29,125
Doubt it.

54
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:37,365
Ignore that old hag.

55
00:04:39,812 --> 00:04:41,211
Want a swig?

56
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,373
Nah. Thanks, Den.

57
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:46,350
Ray, how's Stevie there doin'?

58
00:04:47,353 --> 00:04:48,581
He's good.

59
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:50,020
Yo, Steve-o!

60
00:04:51,257 --> 00:04:52,451
Me and you, buddy.

61
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,227
Take care now.

62
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:56,592
Always do, Ray.

63
00:04:58,097 --> 00:04:59,291
Always do.

64
00:05:05,605 --> 00:05:07,004
Hi, Charlene.

65
00:05:07,073 --> 00:05:08,097
Hello, Ray.

66
00:05:08,174 --> 00:05:09,573
How was your day?

67
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:10,802
Just fine.

68
00:05:14,547 --> 00:05:16,242
Any thoughts on dinner?

69
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,308
I didn't know what you'd want.

70
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,119
Oh well, then.

71
00:05:22,188 --> 00:05:24,918
How 'bout I head on over
to the Rite-Valu and get us some?

72
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:26,686
What an inspired notion.

73
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,653
Any ideas?

74
00:05:33,032 --> 00:05:34,021
Pizza.

75
00:05:35,368 --> 00:05:36,630
Pizza's fine, Ray.

76
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:39,904
Want to come with?

77
00:05:45,778 --> 00:05:48,474
Might be nice for you
to get out once in a while.

78
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:52,313
<i>Let's just say</i>
<i>that Ray's wife Charlene</i>

79
00:05:52,385 --> 00:05:53,943
<i>had some issues,</i>

80
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:57,683
<i>which meant he handled</i>
<i>most of the domestic duties,</i>

81
00:05:57,757 --> 00:06:00,453
<i>like the daily trips</i>
<i>to the local market.</i>

82
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:06,789
<i>The Rite-Valu didn't have much,</i>
<i>but it did have one thing...</i>

83
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:08,834
<i>Nora McCalley.</i>

84
00:06:18,611 --> 00:06:19,600
Hey, Nora.

85
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:21,840
Oh, hey, Ray.

86
00:06:21,914 --> 00:06:23,848
That delivery of
frozen pizzas come in yet?

87
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:25,349
Supposed to have gotten them today,

88
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:27,784
but Cliff's engine blew up
on his way back from town.

89
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:31,186
Guess I'll go for
the Dinty Moore, then.

90
00:06:31,257 --> 00:06:32,690
That's heat-and-serve, ain't it?

91
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:34,886
Sure is.
Over on aisle five.

92
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:36,019
Right.

93
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:44,331
You notice that Chevron station
around the bend's nearly done?

94
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:45,393
It's a pretty sight.

95
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:47,735
About the prettiest thing
in this whole county.

96
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:50,139
- They puttin' in a mini-mart?
- Yep.

97
00:06:50,209 --> 00:06:52,609
If that doesn't do in this place,
I don't know what will.

98
00:06:52,678 --> 00:06:53,838
Well...

99
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:56,848
I'm sure they're not gonna have
fresh fruit and things.

100
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,907
Or, for that matter, you.

101
00:07:00,787 --> 00:07:02,345
Oh, that'll be $4.10.

102
00:07:03,489 --> 00:07:04,547
Five.

103
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:06,956
Keep the change.

104
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:10,026
Now, Ray,
you gotta stop doing that.

105
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:12,030
It's my pleasure, Nora.

106
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:14,692
If you're not the most
generous man I've ever met!

107
00:07:18,037 --> 00:07:22,030
Well, guess I'll be seeing
you... tomorrow.

108
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:24,735
I'll be here.

109
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:35,685
How many cars
did you process today, dear?

110
00:07:35,755 --> 00:07:37,017
146.

111
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,386
Quite a lot, isn't it?

112
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,154
Heavier than normal.

113
00:07:41,227 --> 00:07:42,421
And how was your day?

114
00:07:43,529 --> 00:07:46,521
I found a half-off coupon
on Bounty paper towels

115
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:48,294
with no expiration date.

116
00:07:49,502 --> 00:07:50,935
Isn't that something?

117
00:07:51,003 --> 00:07:52,903
I guess it is, yeah.

118
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:54,633
What about you, son?

119
00:07:54,707 --> 00:07:58,575
I busted some windows
on a couple of houses down the street.

120
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:01,477
I want to burn down
that shitbox up the street

121
00:08:01,547 --> 00:08:03,742
that that dead guy croaked in.

122
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:05,477
Now, son,
we talked about this.

123
00:08:05,551 --> 00:08:07,109
You got to work on your anger.

124
00:08:07,186 --> 00:08:09,450
I wouldn't have any
if you took me to Betsy's.

125
00:08:10,456 --> 00:08:11,718
We'll see, son.

126
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:13,622
All you say is "Soon, son."

127
00:08:13,693 --> 00:08:15,820
Do I look like
I'm getting any younger?

128
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:20,059
I'll get it.

129
00:08:25,238 --> 00:08:26,227
Hello?

130
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:29,641
No, this is his son Edward.

131
00:08:33,813 --> 00:08:35,007
Okay.

132
00:08:38,651 --> 00:08:40,175
Who was that, dear?

133
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:41,413
Aunt Penny.

134
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:49,960
What did she want?

135
00:08:51,163 --> 00:08:55,224
Grandma's in the hospital,
in a "comma" or something.

136
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:02,164
I wasn't really listening.

137
00:09:05,111 --> 00:09:09,047
This looks like a fun one, Ma.
Pigs in a Twinkie.

138
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:12,676
"Thinly slice one end
off each Twinkie.

139
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:16,648
"Stuff a cooked sausage
into each Twinkie.

140
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:19,452
"Place the Twinkies
in a shallow baking dish

141
00:09:19,525 --> 00:09:22,892
"and bake for 10 minutes
or until the Twinkies are warm.

142
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:24,793
Serve warm with syrup."

143
00:09:25,798 --> 00:09:26,924
Penny?

144
00:09:26,999 --> 00:09:28,125
Hey, Ray.

145
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,292
Oh, hey, Eddie.

146
00:09:29,368 --> 00:09:31,768
I came as soon as I heard.
What happened, anyhow?

147
00:09:31,837 --> 00:09:35,000
Well, I think she was trimming
a hangnail over the toilet,

148
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:37,304
passed out,
hit her head on the porcelain.

149
00:09:38,377 --> 00:09:41,141
I been here all day
trying to get her conscious enough

150
00:09:41,213 --> 00:09:42,942
to give me that meringue recipe.

151
00:09:45,818 --> 00:09:48,514
Hey, Ma.
How you feeling?

152
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,146
You comfortable?

153
00:09:50,222 --> 00:09:51,621
Guys.

154
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:53,955
Oh, here we go.

155
00:09:54,026 --> 00:09:55,254
Mark.

156
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:57,091
Hey, Uncle Mark.

157
00:09:57,163 --> 00:09:58,721
Hey.

158
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,933
The fruits from my loins.

159
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:04,992
Ma!

160
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:08,165
Your meringue recipe...
three parts lemon, two parts sugar?

161
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,229
Ma?

162
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:11,740
Oh, Mama...

163
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:13,278
Mama.

164
00:10:14,714 --> 00:10:17,581
He's been like this all day.

165
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:18,810
Hey, Mark.

166
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:21,411
How's business going?

167
00:10:22,421 --> 00:10:23,683
Pretty darn good.

168
00:10:24,757 --> 00:10:27,590
Introduced a new flavor
this week from Poland,

169
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,855
Champagne Silk.

170
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:31,590
It goes down real easy.

171
00:10:32,598 --> 00:10:33,792
Sounds great.

172
00:10:33,866 --> 00:10:37,529
Sauerkraut is, without question,
the superfood of the future.

173
00:10:37,603 --> 00:10:38,729
Daddy!

174
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:42,433
Hi, everyone.

175
00:10:42,508 --> 00:10:44,339
- Hey, Joanne.
- Joanne.

176
00:10:45,344 --> 00:10:48,142
Mark, can I have
a private word with you, please?

177
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:51,081
Joanne, get back in the car.

178
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,481
Your kids need you.

179
00:10:52,551 --> 00:10:54,280
You are coming home this instant!

180
00:10:54,353 --> 00:10:56,082
Would you shut them up, please?

181
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:59,089
Tommy, no!

182
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:01,991
Those kids have got germs!
Get them out of this room!

183
00:11:07,099 --> 00:11:12,867
<i>As we all know, family gatherings</i>
<i>can be quite taxing at times,</i>

184
00:11:12,938 --> 00:11:16,897
<i>but everything in Trona was taxing...</i>
<i>that was nothin' new.</i>

185
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:20,310
<i>Dirk and his posse,</i>
<i>for some time,</i>

186
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:23,439
<i>had a hold on most things in town...</i>

187
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:26,278
<i>but lately, it seemed that hold</i>

188
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:29,981
<i>was getting closer</i>
<i>and closer to home for Ray.</i>

189
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:34,558
Afternoon, Spoonie.

190
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:35,685
Toll road.

191
00:11:36,729 --> 00:11:37,855
How's that?

192
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:39,261
Five bucks to pass.

193
00:11:40,566 --> 00:11:41,760
You're joshin', right?

194
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:43,893
Do I look like I'm joshin' you, retard?

195
00:11:43,969 --> 00:11:47,268
Five bones or I beat the crap
out of your kid every day next week.

196
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:01,884
Don't hurt my boy, you hear?

197
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:04,185
He never did anything to you.

198
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:07,583
Good call, Ray-gay.

199
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,924
I might kick his ass
anyhow just for fun.

200
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:25,400
Dirk! Hey, Dirk!

201
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:27,002
Why you keep hounding me, woman?

202
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:29,138
I'm working on my bike.
Can't you see that?

203
00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:31,809
All you guys shut your mouths
and go in the house before...

204
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:34,250
Kid's a modern-day
Charles Manson.

205
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:56,339
You ever notice
how Dirk gets all them chicks?

206
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:00,010
He ain't as good-looking
as me, is he?

207
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,248
He's got the devil in him, Ed.

208
00:13:03,315 --> 00:13:05,783
Who cares when you're
that successful?

209
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,583
Who wants dessert?

210
00:13:08,654 --> 00:13:11,817
Dessert?
What a nice twist.

211
00:13:11,891 --> 00:13:13,654
Oh, I don't think
we have anything.

212
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:16,923
I was just interested
to see who might be...

213
00:13:16,996 --> 00:13:18,827
interested.

214
00:13:21,267 --> 00:13:22,962
I'll have a look anyway.

215
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:33,035
Hey, Dad, could we
go get my rocks off tonight?

216
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:36,377
Son, I don't like that kind of talk.
You know better than that.

217
00:13:36,448 --> 00:13:39,417
You keep saying you're going
to take me and never deliver.

218
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:41,180
You're just a bullshit artist.

219
00:13:41,253 --> 00:13:42,379
Who's an artist?

220
00:13:44,723 --> 00:13:46,554
Guess what I found in the freezer?

221
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,696
What do you say
to your mother, son?

222
00:13:55,734 --> 00:13:58,703
Gee, thanks, Ma.
This looks delicious.

223
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:15,610
<i>Now, Betsy's wasn't exactly</i>

224
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:18,179
<i>where Ray had hoped Eddie</i>
<i>would lose his virtue,</i>

225
00:14:18,257 --> 00:14:21,954
<i>but Ray still owed his son</i>
<i>a graduation present</i>

226
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:25,428
<i>and decided it was probably</i>
<i>as good a gift as any.</i>

227
00:14:25,497 --> 00:14:27,192
Evening, ladies.

228
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:29,063
What can we do for you, sugar?

229
00:14:29,134 --> 00:14:30,465
This here's my son Ed.

230
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,299
Need to get his cherry popped.

231
00:14:34,106 --> 00:14:35,198
I don't want that on my head.

232
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:37,003
But he's a good, clean kid, honest.

233
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:42,007
$50 for the full treatment,
and I'll be real gentle.

234
00:14:45,084 --> 00:14:46,745
Can't I have 'em both?

235
00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:49,151
Let's not get ahead
of ourselves, son.

236
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:51,382
Can you do $35?
That's all I got.

237
00:14:51,457 --> 00:14:52,981
Yeah, okay.

238
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:56,721
Meet me around the corner
at the Aloha, room 107.

239
00:14:56,795 --> 00:14:58,592
Give me a ten-minute head start.

240
00:15:00,499 --> 00:15:02,558
You sure this is
how you want to lose it, honey?

241
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:05,230
Don't worry about me, blood.

242
00:15:06,438 --> 00:15:08,463
Just lay back and enjoy the ride.

243
00:15:09,608 --> 00:15:12,475
Shit, I might have to watch this.

244
00:15:12,544 --> 00:15:14,307
Appreciate it, ma'am.

245
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:17,406
Any time you wanna come back...

246
00:15:45,344 --> 00:15:47,835
Well, this is a big day for you, son.

247
00:15:49,081 --> 00:15:50,070
I guess.

248
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:54,280
Remember what I told you.
Always be a gentleman.

249
00:15:54,353 --> 00:15:57,083
Never go poking around
without asking if it's okay first.

250
00:15:57,156 --> 00:15:59,090
They're human beings too,
these whores.

251
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:01,657
Brush your teeth today?

252
00:16:03,395 --> 00:16:04,487
I don't remember.

253
00:16:05,497 --> 00:16:06,555
Shower?

254
00:16:08,033 --> 00:16:09,523
Couple nights ago.

255
00:16:09,601 --> 00:16:12,001
Well... that'll do ya.

256
00:16:13,105 --> 00:16:15,573
Sounds to me like
you're ready for the big plunge.

257
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,603
It's about time.

258
00:16:18,677 --> 00:16:21,669
Most of the guys in school
got laid by third grade.

259
00:16:22,715 --> 00:16:25,684
Ed, we all march to the sound
of our own drummer.

260
00:16:25,751 --> 00:16:27,582
Don't ever forget that.

261
00:16:29,188 --> 00:16:30,416
Okay, then.

262
00:16:34,026 --> 00:16:37,518
Here's the cash
and some rubbers

263
00:16:37,596 --> 00:16:41,430
your Uncle Mark brought me back
from the Grenada conflict in '83.

264
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:46,197
You sure they're still good?

265
00:16:46,271 --> 00:16:48,466
U.S. Government issue.

266
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,201
I think they got Kevlar in 'em.

267
00:16:51,443 --> 00:16:53,934
Okay, I gotta run by the hospital,

268
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,537
check on your grandma.

269
00:16:55,614 --> 00:16:57,275
I'll see you in an hour, okay?

270
00:16:58,917 --> 00:16:59,975
Yeah?

271
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:03,588
Good luck, son.

272
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,489
You want some music?

273
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:30,201
You okay, honey?

274
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,476
I don't want to do this.

275
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,776
You mean have sex?

276
00:18:40,719 --> 00:18:45,213
I kept buggin' my dad
so he'd think I was normal.

277
00:18:47,826 --> 00:18:50,590
It's not that I don't have
any sex drive or nothin'.

278
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:53,624
It's just...

279
00:18:53,699 --> 00:18:56,634
You want the first time to be
with someone you care about.

280
00:19:02,674 --> 00:19:04,141
I wish I'd waited.

281
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:10,046
Where are you from?

282
00:19:10,115 --> 00:19:11,844
Born in Mobile,

283
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:14,215
came out here
a few months ago with my mama.

284
00:19:14,286 --> 00:19:15,878
She's what you call a medium.

285
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:18,449
What's that?

286
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:21,517
Well, you know, like, a psychic.

287
00:19:22,528 --> 00:19:24,758
Someone who predicts things.

288
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:27,321
Anyhow, me and her
had a falling out,

289
00:19:27,399 --> 00:19:30,232
as they say,
so I hit the trail,

290
00:19:30,302 --> 00:19:32,429
and now I live in this here motel.

291
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:36,767
Did she predict that?

292
00:19:38,544 --> 00:19:39,875
I don't know.

293
00:19:46,952 --> 00:19:48,681
You want to go out sometime?

294
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,214
Really?

295
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:57,354
Get a meal, or some...
something...

296
00:19:59,464 --> 00:20:00,624
Yeah.

297
00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:05,161
Let me give you my card.

298
00:20:06,171 --> 00:20:10,574
If you give me 24-hour notice,
I can arrange for a night off.

299
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:15,176
How do you say your name?

300
00:20:15,247 --> 00:20:16,544
Rochelle.

301
00:20:20,352 --> 00:20:21,649
Cool.

302
00:20:23,288 --> 00:20:26,451
<i>Dr. Habibi,</i>
<i>please report to room 243.</i>

303
00:20:26,525 --> 00:20:27,822
<i>Dr. Habibi.</i>

304
00:20:31,863 --> 00:20:34,161
<i>Dr. Richards,</i>
<i>please report to the O.R.</i>

305
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:35,700
<i>Dr. Richards.</i>

306
00:20:57,389 --> 00:20:58,947
Afternoon, Spoonie.

307
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:03,157
Let's go.
Cough it up, Ray-gay.

308
00:21:03,228 --> 00:21:05,287
You owes me
from last time, don't forget.

309
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:06,592
That I do.

310
00:21:11,737 --> 00:21:13,466
Here you be.

311
00:21:13,538 --> 00:21:14,732
See that?

312
00:21:14,806 --> 00:21:18,173
See how easy things is
when you understand who's boss?

313
00:21:18,243 --> 00:21:19,471
Oh, yeah.

314
00:21:30,088 --> 00:21:33,546
You dumb... son of a bitch.

315
00:21:40,165 --> 00:21:41,792
Well, lookie who's home early.

316
00:21:41,867 --> 00:21:43,232
Yo, Ray!

317
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:47,705
Double guards to the finish line.
Come to the yard. Come to the yard.

318
00:21:47,773 --> 00:21:49,968
- I got fancy wine coolers, man.
- Hey, guys.

319
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:56,740
Hey, Ed, what's up?

320
00:21:57,983 --> 00:21:59,541
That Uncle Mark's car outside?

321
00:22:01,186 --> 00:22:02,619
Where's your mother?

322
00:22:04,423 --> 00:22:06,983
Son, I asked you a question.

323
00:22:17,035 --> 00:22:18,900
- Touch my balls.
- You send me!

324
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:20,096
You send me.

325
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:22,640
- Touch my balls.
- You send me.

326
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:25,302
Yeah!
Touch my goddamned balls!

327
00:22:33,318 --> 00:22:34,410
Charlene?

328
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:37,879
Mark?

329
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:43,453
Dear... you're home early.

330
00:22:44,596 --> 00:22:47,565
How was your day?

331
00:22:47,632 --> 00:22:48,690
Hey, Ray.

332
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:55,697
Charlene, can I have
a word with you?

333
00:23:13,425 --> 00:23:15,359
Mind givin' your mom
and me a moment?

334
00:23:27,639 --> 00:23:29,903
Mark's been pretty tore up
about your mom.

335
00:23:31,777 --> 00:23:33,904
He just needed
a little compassion is all.

336
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,844
You never were very understanding,
were you, Ray?

337
00:23:43,155 --> 00:23:44,622
This been goin' on a while?

338
00:23:46,324 --> 00:23:47,484
Charlene.

339
00:23:49,161 --> 00:23:50,287
Since...

340
00:23:53,298 --> 00:23:56,734
'bout nine months
before Eddie was born.

341
00:24:00,238 --> 00:24:01,796
The boy know?

342
00:24:05,076 --> 00:24:06,771
I would imagine.

343
00:24:13,018 --> 00:24:15,885
Why'd you force me to be with you
if I wasn't his father?

344
00:24:17,355 --> 00:24:19,414
Damn, Charlene,
I wasn't even 18.

345
00:24:24,262 --> 00:24:26,457
All them pretty girls wanted you.

346
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:33,370
You need to leave, Charlene.

347
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:04,992
That you, Ray?

348
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:12,333
What are you doin' out here
all by yourself?

349
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:13,638
Not much.

350
00:25:13,712 --> 00:25:15,907
You want me to open back up
so you can get a soda?

351
00:25:15,981 --> 00:25:18,074
Got my paycheck today.
It'll be my treat.

352
00:25:18,149 --> 00:25:19,480
No. Thanks, though.

353
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:21,777
You okay?

354
00:25:22,988 --> 00:25:26,788
This oughta make you feel better...
I got your favorite dessert in today.

355
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:28,120
Banana instant pudding.

356
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:31,060
I hid half a case for you
in personal sundries,

357
00:25:31,129 --> 00:25:32,960
aisle two,
behind the deodorant.

358
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:35,966
Should be quite awhile
before anybody finds it.

359
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:37,661
Catch my meaning?

360
00:25:37,736 --> 00:25:39,431
That's awful sweet of you.

361
00:25:41,339 --> 00:25:43,830
Oh, Ray, what is it?
Tell me.

362
00:25:44,843 --> 00:25:46,401
Just some trouble at home,

363
00:25:46,478 --> 00:25:49,140
me and Charlene stuff.

364
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:51,148
That's horrible.

365
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:54,014
I just want to sit here for a while,
if you don't mind.

366
00:25:54,085 --> 00:25:55,245
'Course.

367
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,254
I better skedaddle, anyway.

368
00:25:57,322 --> 00:25:59,347
Don't wanna miss
"The Big Spin" on TV.

369
00:25:59,424 --> 00:26:01,619
I came within two numbers last time.

370
00:26:02,994 --> 00:26:05,121
Well... 'night, Ray.

371
00:26:05,196 --> 00:26:06,686
Goodnight.

372
00:27:30,615 --> 00:27:31,673
Yo, Ray.

373
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:35,316
Dirk shut off the power again.

374
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:37,952
Did you pay the rent, Den?

375
00:27:39,057 --> 00:27:40,888
My welfares check's late.

376
00:27:40,959 --> 00:27:42,324
You gotta pay the man, Den.

377
00:27:42,394 --> 00:27:45,363
It affects the whole block
if even one household ain't current.

378
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:47,489
You know how he is that way.

379
00:27:47,565 --> 00:27:50,966
That punk... he deserves
to have his face rearranged,

380
00:27:51,036 --> 00:27:53,027
stealin' our electricity.

381
00:27:53,104 --> 00:27:55,129
It's hotter than hell in there!

382
00:28:16,661 --> 00:28:18,322
Okay, good to go.

383
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:21,696
You can do it, Char.

384
00:28:22,934 --> 00:28:25,095
"One small step for man" type deal.

385
00:28:26,104 --> 00:28:27,093
No, I can't.

386
00:28:27,172 --> 00:28:30,801
It's... for... the... best!

387
00:28:31,976 --> 00:28:34,342
Yeah. See how easy that was?

388
00:28:36,981 --> 00:28:38,073
You look so pretty.

389
00:28:38,149 --> 00:28:39,946
You look so pretty in the sunshine.

390
00:28:40,018 --> 00:28:41,610
- We did it.
- You sure did.

391
00:28:41,686 --> 00:28:43,085
You did it all by yourself.

392
00:28:43,154 --> 00:28:44,951
We did it.
Oh, my God.

393
00:28:55,333 --> 00:28:57,267
<i>Funny thing about change...</i>

394
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:01,338
<i>it's kinda like pullin' off a bandage.</i>

395
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:07,239
<i>Hurts like hell when you do it,</i>
<i>but you always feel better after.</i>

396
00:29:26,898 --> 00:29:27,990
Yo, Ray.

397
00:29:29,501 --> 00:29:34,029
Was that Eddie I seen... headin' off
in your brother's car awhile back?

398
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:36,039
That'd be him.

399
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:38,166
Who was that woman with him?

400
00:29:39,711 --> 00:29:40,837
Charlene.

401
00:29:40,912 --> 00:29:41,901
Serious?

402
00:29:42,981 --> 00:29:45,347
Lord, I can't remember
the last time I seen her.

403
00:29:46,918 --> 00:29:48,249
She don't get out much.

404
00:29:49,387 --> 00:29:50,718
Not a lot, no.

405
00:29:52,924 --> 00:29:54,221
You all right, Ray?

406
00:29:57,495 --> 00:29:59,486
You know if you ever
need someone to talk to,

407
00:29:59,564 --> 00:30:01,259
you got a friend right here.

408
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,024
Just like that night in '89.

409
00:30:05,036 --> 00:30:06,298
Who made that key block,

410
00:30:06,371 --> 00:30:08,430
time runnin' out,
you sprintin' upfield?

411
00:30:08,506 --> 00:30:10,133
You did, Den.

412
00:30:10,208 --> 00:30:11,766
A thing of beauty that was.

413
00:30:12,777 --> 00:30:14,438
Me and you, Ray.

414
00:30:15,446 --> 00:30:17,471
We won that game together, we did.

415
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:21,975
Pay your rent, Den.

416
00:30:22,053 --> 00:30:23,680
Yeah. I know.

417
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:31,227
That's good, now stabilize it
so I can see it better.

418
00:30:31,296 --> 00:30:34,129
Okay. Yeah, now... now...
now just kinda...

419
00:30:34,199 --> 00:30:35,530
<i>I've never met a guy</i>

420
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,625
<i>who picked up trash</i>
<i>from the roadside</i>

421
00:30:37,702 --> 00:30:39,329
<i>who wasn't in a work program.</i>

422
00:30:39,404 --> 00:30:42,066
Excuse me.
This your place?

423
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:43,266
Yeah, I guess it is.

424
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:46,242
Just wondering if it'd be okay
to dump this trash in your bins.

425
00:30:46,311 --> 00:30:47,335
Oh, yeah, no problem.

426
00:30:47,412 --> 00:30:50,210
<i>But that's what I found</i>
<i>endearing about Ray.</i>

427
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:52,748
<i>At least he was tryin'.</i>

428
00:30:52,817 --> 00:30:54,876
You got it, boss.

429
00:30:54,953 --> 00:30:56,045
I don't know.

430
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:58,418
Everybody in town
keeps talkin' about this place.

431
00:30:58,489 --> 00:31:00,116
Yeah? You live around here?

432
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:01,715
Yep, just around the bend.

433
00:31:03,494 --> 00:31:05,086
Is there any traffic at all?

434
00:31:05,163 --> 00:31:06,630
- Hardly ever.
- None, huh?

435
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:09,792
Except during holidays, sometimes
folks head out to Death Valley.

436
00:31:11,402 --> 00:31:12,994
You own Chevron?

437
00:31:13,071 --> 00:31:14,265
Own it? No.

438
00:31:14,339 --> 00:31:16,170
I'm just an independent operator.

439
00:31:16,241 --> 00:31:18,436
I'm from Bakersfield.
My name's Merl Stryker.

440
00:31:18,509 --> 00:31:20,534
Ray Tuckby.
It's a pleasure, Merl.

441
00:31:20,612 --> 00:31:22,011
Welcome to Trona.

442
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,105
Thank you.
Yes, it's quite a place here.

443
00:31:24,182 --> 00:31:26,480
I've never seen anything quite like it.

444
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:30,954
It's just... pretty sorry-ass.

445
00:31:31,022 --> 00:31:33,149
I hope you don't mind, I mean...

446
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:34,521
nothing grows here.

447
00:31:34,592 --> 00:31:36,457
Well, soil's too poisoned.

448
00:31:36,527 --> 00:31:39,087
Plus, it hasn't rained here
in about forever.

449
00:31:39,163 --> 00:31:41,791
Used to be beautiful,
though, as I remember.

450
00:31:41,866 --> 00:31:45,825
Mid-'80s, state diverted our water
from Owens River to L.A.

451
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:48,771
The lake dried up,
the chemical companies moved in,

452
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,137
place went to hell.

453
00:31:50,208 --> 00:31:52,176
That's a sad story.

454
00:31:53,311 --> 00:31:56,178
Who's that little fucker
that charges me to get into town?

455
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:58,010
That'd be Dirk
or one of his boys.

456
00:31:58,082 --> 00:31:59,913
They sort of run things around here.

457
00:31:59,984 --> 00:32:01,417
Kids?

458
00:32:01,486 --> 00:32:03,852
They're responsible
for most of the revenue.

459
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:05,685
He got his own meth lab.

460
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:07,224
What about the cops?

461
00:32:07,292 --> 00:32:08,623
Ain't none here.

462
00:32:08,693 --> 00:32:12,094
When the state declared this area
a toxic waste site a few years back,

463
00:32:12,163 --> 00:32:14,222
anybody respectable cleared out.

464
00:32:14,299 --> 00:32:16,733
Then they offered
these places at a cut rate.

465
00:32:16,801 --> 00:32:18,666
Dirk near bought up the town.

466
00:32:18,736 --> 00:32:21,466
Story's gettin'
sadder and sadder.

467
00:32:21,539 --> 00:32:25,134
Hey, Ray, is there a place
around here to get a cup of joe?

468
00:32:25,209 --> 00:32:27,177
I'm hittin' my morning crash.

469
00:32:27,245 --> 00:32:30,305
Market in town has a coffee pot,
one of them bottomless jobs,

470
00:32:30,381 --> 00:32:33,009
and 'bout the prettiest gal
you'll ever set eyes on.

471
00:32:33,084 --> 00:32:36,053
Oh, yeah? I think that's
where we should go.

472
00:32:47,365 --> 00:32:48,798
- Mornin', Ray.
- Hey, Nora.

473
00:32:48,866 --> 00:32:51,699
This here's Merl Stryker,
owner of that Chevron station.

474
00:32:51,769 --> 00:32:54,863
- Nora McCalley.
- Well, it is an honor, Mr. Stryker.

475
00:32:54,939 --> 00:32:55,963
How do you do, ma'am.

476
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:58,440
That's quite a place
you're building out there.

477
00:32:59,444 --> 00:33:02,971
Ray was not telling a lie
when he said you are a fox.

478
00:33:05,116 --> 00:33:08,279
Well, maybe in contrast
to the surroundings.

479
00:33:08,353 --> 00:33:09,820
What can I get for you two?

480
00:33:09,887 --> 00:33:11,684
Couple cups of coffee if it's fresh.

481
00:33:11,756 --> 00:33:12,916
Just made a batch.

482
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:19,691
This place looks
like a cyclone hit it.

483
00:33:19,764 --> 00:33:22,198
There's not much
in the way of supplies.

484
00:33:22,266 --> 00:33:23,528
We get by basically.

485
00:33:24,535 --> 00:33:25,695
Here you go.

486
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:28,705
The Cremora's just behind you
on the counter, sir.

487
00:33:28,773 --> 00:33:30,206
Thank you, honeybunch.

488
00:33:34,545 --> 00:33:35,910
Do something with your hair?

489
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:37,072
Me?

490
00:33:45,757 --> 00:33:47,247
Got any dreams, Ray?

491
00:33:52,764 --> 00:33:53,890
Dreams?

492
00:33:54,932 --> 00:33:56,126
Yeah.

493
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:59,169
Dreams. A man's got to strive
for something big in life.

494
00:33:59,237 --> 00:34:02,638
Otherwise, he doesn't mean
a rat's ass to himself or society.

495
00:34:03,641 --> 00:34:06,439
To be honest, I basically just
go from one day to the next

496
00:34:06,511 --> 00:34:08,502
trying to feel good about myself.

497
00:34:08,579 --> 00:34:11,104
I'm 58 years old.
I still got big dreams.

498
00:34:11,182 --> 00:34:14,174
Mean to tell me you didn't have
big ones even when you were a kid?

499
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:17,146
Some.

500
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:21,453
What about what you
were telling me about before,

501
00:34:21,526 --> 00:34:25,929
how you thought it'd be great
if this area all came back.

502
00:34:25,997 --> 00:34:27,897
That's a big dream of sorts, isn't it?

503
00:34:30,668 --> 00:34:31,999
I guess.

504
00:34:34,872 --> 00:34:37,170
Maybe have that lake
full of trout and bass...

505
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:41,606
nice outdoor eatery
on that pier down yonder...

506
00:34:44,315 --> 00:34:46,840
a place where people
could get a cold drink,

507
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:48,579
admire the beauty again.

508
00:34:50,221 --> 00:34:53,190
Now you're talking.
It sounds pretty good to me.

509
00:34:58,729 --> 00:35:00,458
Well, Merl, I gotta get on to work.

510
00:35:00,531 --> 00:35:02,396
Nice to make your acquaintance.

511
00:35:02,467 --> 00:35:03,991
Pleasure was mine.

512
00:35:04,068 --> 00:35:05,399
Thank you for the coffee.

513
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:08,196
Keep the wheels turning.

514
00:35:12,577 --> 00:35:14,408
There you go.

515
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:22,809
If you eat a little more food,
you can be sleeping in your own bed.

516
00:35:22,887 --> 00:35:24,149
Won't that be nice?

517
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:30,090
Yeah, that's it.

518
00:35:31,095 --> 00:35:32,323
It's good, huh?

519
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:35,864
Vanilla custard, yes indeed.

520
00:35:37,502 --> 00:35:41,165
Yes, that's my good girl.

521
00:35:43,908 --> 00:35:46,274
I want you out of my house.

522
00:35:47,345 --> 00:35:48,403
What, Ma?

523
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:52,608
Get that crap away from me,
you kiss-ass.

524
00:35:52,683 --> 00:35:57,711
All you want is that meringue recipe,
and it'll never happen.

525
00:35:57,788 --> 00:36:01,121
You couldn't cook
your way out of a Ziploc.

526
00:36:01,192 --> 00:36:04,161
No wonder you could
never hold on to a man.

527
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:09,327
You're going to end up a lesbian
if you're not one already.

528
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:11,858
Evening, miss.

529
00:36:13,804 --> 00:36:14,964
Hello.

530
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:18,236
I hate your guts.

531
00:36:18,309 --> 00:36:19,936
I don't care.

532
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:22,844
I have never asked you
for one thing, God damn...

533
00:36:22,914 --> 00:36:24,040
Then don't.

534
00:36:24,115 --> 00:36:27,414
You are gonna cough up
that fucking recipe.

535
00:36:27,485 --> 00:36:29,919
Dream on, you old maid.

536
00:36:29,987 --> 00:36:31,511
Don't push me.

537
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:33,054
Don't push <i>me.</i>

538
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:08,718
Ma, I brought your favorite.

539
00:37:10,695 --> 00:37:11,787
Ma?

540
00:37:13,264 --> 00:37:14,390
Penny?

541
00:37:18,936 --> 00:37:24,670
For today we are mourning the loss
of two remarkable individuals...

542
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:30,343
Penny Varrow,
a willful woman of character

543
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:32,974
who led an independent life,

544
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:38,955
most recently running a crisis center
for abandoned spouses...

545
00:37:39,023 --> 00:37:40,786
and Ruth Tuckby,

546
00:37:40,858 --> 00:37:46,091
devoted mother, wife,
and local knitting legend,

547
00:37:46,163 --> 00:37:51,032
who strove to make
the lives of those around her richer.

548
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:54,560
They were both good women

549
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:58,871
who celebrated their differences
throughout a rocky relationship.

550
00:38:01,646 --> 00:38:05,446
Well, ultimately celebrated them
a little too much, I reckon.

551
00:38:13,357 --> 00:38:14,790
Mark. Mark!

552
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,594
Mark!

553
00:38:23,668 --> 00:38:24,657
Shut up.

554
00:38:24,735 --> 00:38:25,759
- Mark.
- Ray.

555
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:28,203
Hey, Clem.

556
00:38:28,272 --> 00:38:30,797
I'm... I'm sorry for your loss.

557
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:36,508
I know this is not the best time
to talk business, but...

558
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:37,842
That's okay.

559
00:38:37,915 --> 00:38:40,213
The bulk of the estate goes
to you and your brother.

560
00:38:40,284 --> 00:38:42,081
The house, as you may know,

561
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:44,451
was pretty heavily leveraged
awhile back,

562
00:38:44,522 --> 00:38:47,923
plus she didn't have much
in the way of medical coverage.

563
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:50,288
Right.

564
00:38:50,361 --> 00:38:54,195
Son, this here's your share.

565
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,958
Thanks for all your help, Clem.

566
00:38:58,035 --> 00:38:59,059
Sorry.

567
00:39:00,071 --> 00:39:02,062
Oh, I forgot to give you this.

568
00:39:02,139 --> 00:39:03,936
Your mama wanted you to have it.

569
00:39:06,644 --> 00:39:08,703
Well, if there's
anything else you need,

570
00:39:08,779 --> 00:39:11,612
I'll be in Ridgecrest,
bored to tears.

571
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:42,743
Eddie? You got a minute?

572
00:39:42,813 --> 00:39:44,371
Not today, Ray.
I'm busy.

573
00:39:46,083 --> 00:39:47,948
I need to speak to you, son.

574
00:39:48,018 --> 00:39:49,349
R'ch'lle, excuse us.

575
00:39:50,354 --> 00:39:51,412
Here you go.

576
00:39:55,526 --> 00:39:56,550
What is it?

577
00:39:57,628 --> 00:39:58,890
I got something for you.

578
00:39:59,764 --> 00:40:01,095
Like what?

579
00:40:01,165 --> 00:40:02,359
You should have this.

580
00:40:02,433 --> 00:40:04,993
Your grandma
would've wanted it that way.

581
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:06,229
Go on, take it.

582
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:13,274
Eleven hundred bucks?

583
00:40:13,344 --> 00:40:14,641
For college.

584
00:40:14,712 --> 00:40:16,179
College?

585
00:40:18,282 --> 00:40:20,147
What the hell's
the matter with you, Ray?

586
00:40:20,217 --> 00:40:23,050
I got better things to do
with this money and my time

587
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,985
than get some stupid education.

588
00:40:26,724 --> 00:40:28,783
Me and R'ch'lle
is moving in together.

589
00:40:31,729 --> 00:40:33,219
I just wanted to say that...

590
00:40:34,298 --> 00:40:37,699
even though we both know
you're not my own flesh and blood...

591
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:41,070
I still love you, son.

592
00:40:42,339 --> 00:40:45,172
Hey, let's get a move on.
I'm gonna be late for work.

593
00:40:48,512 --> 00:40:50,639
Dirk offered me a gig.

594
00:40:50,714 --> 00:40:52,579
I'm finally gonna make
some real coin.

595
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:54,049
That's a dead end, Ed.

596
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:55,278
Not to me, it ain't.

597
00:40:55,352 --> 00:40:58,219
Ed, this train is leaving the station.

598
00:40:59,557 --> 00:41:00,615
Ed...

599
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:03,987
I'll see you around.

600
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:07,154
If you need anything, son,
you let me know.

601
00:41:07,231 --> 00:41:09,358
Yeah. All right.

602
00:41:35,059 --> 00:41:37,391
Dirk's boys held up
the delivery truck again.

603
00:41:37,461 --> 00:41:39,691
All we got left
is Shake 'n Bake, aisle five.

604
00:41:40,698 --> 00:41:42,825
But... we're out of chicken.

605
00:41:44,568 --> 00:41:45,728
These'll do me.

606
00:41:46,937 --> 00:41:48,871
I was going to eat light
tonight anyhow.

607
00:41:53,444 --> 00:41:57,847
Pork rinds and a large bag
of ranch-flavored sunflower seeds.

608
00:41:59,083 --> 00:42:00,482
Anything to drink with that?

609
00:42:00,551 --> 00:42:03,577
Nah. Plenty of water in the tap,
I always say.

610
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:09,049
I bet you could use
a home-cooked meal one of these days.

611
00:42:09,126 --> 00:42:10,787
Yeah, well...

612
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:19,298
Sorry about you and Charlene...

613
00:42:20,337 --> 00:42:21,565
and your mom...

614
00:42:23,107 --> 00:42:24,506
and Penny.

615
00:42:25,609 --> 00:42:28,134
Trying to look at it
as a new beginning.

616
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:29,804
May take me awhile to get there.

617
00:42:31,315 --> 00:42:33,840
Anyway, thanks
for coming to the funeral.

618
00:42:33,918 --> 00:42:35,112
Saw you sitting in back.

619
00:42:35,185 --> 00:42:36,584
Oh, my pleasure, Ray.

620
00:42:38,188 --> 00:42:39,587
So, what are you doing later?

621
00:42:41,091 --> 00:42:43,753
Later, like... tonight later?

622
00:42:43,827 --> 00:42:46,318
Yeah, for a start.

623
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:48,627
Well, I'll probably just go home

624
00:42:48,699 --> 00:42:52,465
and sort through all
the death papers and stuff, I guess.

625
00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:54,459
You?

626
00:42:54,538 --> 00:42:57,996
I'd really like to go
into Ridgecrest and see a movie.

627
00:42:58,075 --> 00:42:59,804
- It's been awhile.
- Yeah?

628
00:42:59,877 --> 00:43:03,176
Maybe get a bite after at that
new Arby's folks are talking about?

629
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:05,647
Oh, yeah. I drove by it
a couple times.

630
00:43:05,716 --> 00:43:07,650
Might be worth checking out.

631
00:43:14,391 --> 00:43:16,951
Well... see you soon, Nora.

632
00:43:17,027 --> 00:43:18,551
Hope so, Ray.

633
00:44:55,592 --> 00:44:56,616
Nora.

634
00:44:58,162 --> 00:45:00,153
You wanna go on a date...

635
00:45:00,230 --> 00:45:01,561
with me?

636
00:45:01,632 --> 00:45:04,567
Been waiting 18 years
for you to ask.

637
00:46:50,974 --> 00:46:52,965
Where'd you get
all this fresh food?

638
00:46:53,043 --> 00:46:56,171
Got up bright and early this morning,
drove special out to Ridgecrest.

639
00:46:56,246 --> 00:46:57,304
Cook it yourself?

640
00:46:58,882 --> 00:47:01,942
That's about the sweetest thing
anyone's ever done for me.

641
00:47:02,019 --> 00:47:04,214
I mean, that is,
if you did do it for me.

642
00:47:04,288 --> 00:47:05,380
I did.

643
00:47:07,958 --> 00:47:11,086
Ray, how come you never got
out of here when you had the chance?

644
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:13,129
Me? I don't know.

645
00:47:14,298 --> 00:47:16,994
I know you got that offer
a few years back, going to L.A.,

646
00:47:17,067 --> 00:47:18,762
work for that friend of your dad's.

647
00:47:20,470 --> 00:47:21,732
Didn't suit me, I guess.

648
00:47:25,075 --> 00:47:26,235
This is my home.

649
00:47:27,711 --> 00:47:28,973
I used to love it here.

650
00:47:30,981 --> 00:47:32,471
Summers felt endless.

651
00:47:33,483 --> 00:47:34,814
Swimming, fishing,

652
00:47:34,885 --> 00:47:37,445
just being able to breath
all that cool, fresh air.

653
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:41,116
I hold on to those memories,
a lot of other ones, too.

654
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:44,083
Like that one in second grade

655
00:47:44,161 --> 00:47:47,130
when Mrs. Kinney took us
on that field trip to this very spot

656
00:47:47,197 --> 00:47:49,563
and I got a baked bean
stuck in my nose?

657
00:47:49,633 --> 00:47:51,328
You remember that?

658
00:47:51,401 --> 00:47:53,631
I wouldn't stop crying.

659
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:56,138
You came right over,
just like a little prince.

660
00:47:56,206 --> 00:47:57,867
You picked me up
and you carried me

661
00:47:57,941 --> 00:47:59,238
all the way back to the bus.

662
00:48:00,377 --> 00:48:03,278
I thought it was so romantic...

663
00:48:03,347 --> 00:48:05,747
except maybe that part
about you insisting

664
00:48:05,816 --> 00:48:07,306
on trying to fish the thing out

665
00:48:07,384 --> 00:48:09,784
with one of your dad's
pipe cleaners.

666
00:48:09,853 --> 00:48:12,048
Doctor said you nearly
gave me a lobotomy.

667
00:48:12,122 --> 00:48:14,352
Yeah, I managed to block
that out, actually.

668
00:48:14,424 --> 00:48:15,618
Oh, you did?

669
00:48:19,162 --> 00:48:20,925
I thought it was sweet.

670
00:48:20,998 --> 00:48:23,660
How concerned you were about me,
how much you cared.

671
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:25,827
Yeah, well...

672
00:48:28,672 --> 00:48:29,832
What about you?

673
00:48:30,841 --> 00:48:32,536
Didn't you ever think
about leaving?

674
00:48:32,609 --> 00:48:34,839
From time to time.

675
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:36,675
How come you never did, then?

676
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:38,681
That cheerleading scholarship to UOP

677
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:40,649
sure was a big deal
for you to turn down.

678
00:48:41,919 --> 00:48:43,386
A girl has her reasons.

679
00:49:04,174 --> 00:49:05,869
I had a wonderful afternoon, Ray.

680
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:07,103
Me, too, Nora.

681
00:49:08,478 --> 00:49:10,309
Now, I want you to keep
those leftovers.

682
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:12,405
I made extra
for you to take to work all week.

683
00:49:12,482 --> 00:49:13,506
You sure?

684
00:49:13,583 --> 00:49:16,017
You can't eat packaged food
the rest of your life.

685
00:49:16,086 --> 00:49:18,179
That stuff'll kill you.

686
00:49:18,255 --> 00:49:21,622
Getting a real home-cooked meal
like that sure was something else.

687
00:49:28,899 --> 00:49:34,166
Listen, I know how you must be
feeling about Eddie and all.

688
00:49:40,043 --> 00:49:42,477
You always had
the most beautiful heart, Ray.

689
00:49:47,417 --> 00:49:50,853
Well, I've got to get back to my shift,
so I'll talk on you?

690
00:49:51,755 --> 00:49:52,915
Okay.

691
00:50:59,556 --> 00:51:01,353
Where's my mom and dad?

692
00:51:13,036 --> 00:51:14,264
Yeah?

693
00:51:14,337 --> 00:51:15,599
Dirk here?

694
00:51:15,672 --> 00:51:18,106
Saw him around awhile ago.

695
00:51:18,175 --> 00:51:19,335
Dirk?

696
00:51:20,343 --> 00:51:21,469
Dirk!

697
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:26,579
Oh, I forgot.
He's up at the plant up the street,

698
00:51:26,650 --> 00:51:28,743
but you ain't supposed
to go up there.

699
00:51:33,490 --> 00:51:35,481
Adjust that... adjust that choke.

700
00:51:35,559 --> 00:51:37,390
Hand me that wrench.

701
00:51:43,867 --> 00:51:47,394
Boy, all these leaky drums sure look
like an accident waiting to happen.

702
00:51:47,471 --> 00:51:49,598
What are you doing here?
You ain't allowed.

703
00:51:49,673 --> 00:51:52,164
Well, I wanna talk
to you about my son.

704
00:51:53,176 --> 00:51:55,667
I'd like it if you didn't drag him
into your line of work.

705
00:51:55,745 --> 00:51:57,269
He ain't even yours, old man.

706
00:51:57,347 --> 00:51:59,747
I'm just saying you
don't need him working for you,

707
00:51:59,816 --> 00:52:01,113
all the guys you got.

708
00:52:03,186 --> 00:52:04,813
Do me this favor, Dirk.

709
00:52:06,756 --> 00:52:08,917
- Favor?
- Yeah, this one time.

710
00:52:08,992 --> 00:52:10,687
I ought to kick your ass right now.

711
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:12,159
I don't want trouble, Dirk.

712
00:52:12,229 --> 00:52:14,754
I'm just saying it'd be
a nice thing for you to do,

713
00:52:14,831 --> 00:52:17,356
letting him have
a proper shot at a future.

714
00:52:17,434 --> 00:52:18,799
He's a real good kid.

715
00:52:18,869 --> 00:52:21,235
I know. That's why
he's gonna be working for me.

716
00:52:21,304 --> 00:52:23,067
No, but see...

717
00:52:24,941 --> 00:52:28,342
Only thing I see is
a pathetic jerk who's trespassing.

718
00:52:28,411 --> 00:52:30,936
You tell your neighbors
to pay their rent.

719
00:52:32,182 --> 00:52:34,013
Get the fuck off my property.

720
00:52:34,084 --> 00:52:35,415
Bitch.

721
00:52:57,274 --> 00:52:59,139
You pay the rent yet, Den?

722
00:52:59,209 --> 00:53:01,143
Oh, not real... really.

723
00:53:01,211 --> 00:53:02,473
We've been through this.

724
00:53:02,546 --> 00:53:04,878
You're letting everybody down
when you don't.

725
00:53:06,216 --> 00:53:07,444
Ray, I know that.

726
00:53:07,517 --> 00:53:10,577
Denny, you better do something
about the heat, goddamn it.

727
00:53:10,654 --> 00:53:12,281
I'm bustin' a gasket in here.

728
00:53:14,658 --> 00:53:16,489
<i>I don't want him getting into drugs.</i>

729
00:53:18,428 --> 00:53:19,793
I don't care if I'm not...

730
00:53:21,431 --> 00:53:24,730
Then you tell his real father
to take responsibility for once

731
00:53:24,801 --> 00:53:26,530
and give the boy some guidance.

732
00:53:27,537 --> 00:53:28,663
Charlene?

733
00:53:54,698 --> 00:53:57,258
Here's your rent.
It's too hot to stand on ceremony.

734
00:53:57,334 --> 00:53:58,767
So you walk that over to Dirk's

735
00:53:58,835 --> 00:54:01,303
and you tell him to turn
the power back on, okay?

736
00:54:01,371 --> 00:54:03,032
Roger that, Ray.

737
00:54:03,106 --> 00:54:04,539
I'll make good.
I swear.

738
00:54:04,608 --> 00:54:07,099
Soon, Den.
I can't swing two rents.

739
00:54:07,177 --> 00:54:09,941
Get Selma to quit smoking the ice
and pay your bills.

740
00:54:10,013 --> 00:54:11,071
We clear?

741
00:54:11,147 --> 00:54:12,671
Oh, we're clear as day.

742
00:54:15,218 --> 00:54:18,119
Well, I'm gonna have to
put a shirt on.

743
00:54:18,188 --> 00:54:19,416
Then I'll get on it.

744
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:25,186
Twirling action, like this here.

745
00:54:25,262 --> 00:54:26,923
That's right.
You like that?

746
00:54:26,997 --> 00:54:29,431
See? Yeah? Help yourself.
Take everything.

747
00:54:29,499 --> 00:54:31,399
Next time bring your cars.

748
00:54:31,468 --> 00:54:32,560
You got 'em all?

749
00:54:32,636 --> 00:54:35,196
I got as many Huggies
as I can carry.

750
00:54:35,272 --> 00:54:37,467
I'm gonna sell this shit on eBay.

751
00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:40,100
The free washer fluid
sure was a nice touch.

752
00:54:40,176 --> 00:54:42,974
Look, Nora, you just
swipe your credit card and go.

753
00:54:43,046 --> 00:54:45,139
Kind of feels
like we're in the big city.

754
00:54:46,383 --> 00:54:47,714
Hey, you guys.

755
00:54:47,784 --> 00:54:49,581
- Hey, Stryker.
- Hi, Nora.

756
00:54:49,653 --> 00:54:51,450
This place is just gorgeous.

757
00:54:51,521 --> 00:54:54,115
Thank you.
I'm very, very proud of it.

758
00:54:54,190 --> 00:54:57,956
All I ask is every once in a while
you come on in and fill up a tank.

759
00:54:58,028 --> 00:54:59,757
- Sure.
- Yeah, okay.

760
00:54:59,829 --> 00:55:03,356
And Ray, how's
all that dreaming going, buddy?

761
00:55:03,433 --> 00:55:04,593
A little at a time.

762
00:55:04,668 --> 00:55:07,364
A little at a time,
that's all we can ask for.

763
00:55:08,371 --> 00:55:10,965
- Have fun.
- That man is something else.

764
00:55:14,377 --> 00:55:17,938
You might like to know Eddie's
been doing a real good job for me.

765
00:55:18,014 --> 00:55:19,311
You oughta be proud.

766
00:55:20,517 --> 00:55:22,610
So, are you all of a sudden
the big sugar daddy

767
00:55:22,686 --> 00:55:24,551
for anybody
who needs their rent paid?

768
00:55:24,621 --> 00:55:27,055
It's getting awful hot, Dirk.

769
00:55:27,123 --> 00:55:29,557
Some folks are having
a hard time making ends meet.

770
00:55:29,626 --> 00:55:31,753
Maybe you ought
to mind your own business.

771
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:33,318
It is my business.

772
00:55:33,396 --> 00:55:35,626
Shut off the power,
it hurts all of us.

773
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:39,965
Acting like a tough guy
in front of your new girlfriend here.

774
00:55:41,438 --> 00:55:43,929
Since you're such a rich man,
maybe I oughta raise your rent.

775
00:55:44,007 --> 00:55:46,635
Maybe I should buy a genny
so I don't need your power.

776
00:55:46,710 --> 00:55:48,610
You ain't allowed to do that.

777
00:55:48,678 --> 00:55:49,872
Is that a fact?

778
00:55:52,649 --> 00:55:55,311
I'm gonna lay this out for you
once and for all, old man.

779
00:55:56,319 --> 00:56:00,255
The way things work around here
is everybody does what I tell them to,

780
00:56:00,323 --> 00:56:01,722
and that goes for you double.

781
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:06,125
Now, you don't like it,
and you're gonna get your ass kicked.

782
00:56:07,163 --> 00:56:08,596
Hey, it's mine!

783
00:56:13,236 --> 00:56:14,965
Better hear what I say, Ray.

784
00:56:15,038 --> 00:56:18,235
Hey, knock it off, all of you,
before I lock you in the dog run again.

785
00:56:18,308 --> 00:56:19,400
Give me that!

786
00:56:19,476 --> 00:56:20,568
Sorry, Dirk.

787
00:56:20,643 --> 00:56:23,737
Fighting over a bottle of antifreeze?
What the fuck is that?

788
00:56:24,748 --> 00:56:25,908
It smells great.

789
00:56:25,982 --> 00:56:27,813
Hope I didn't overcook it.

790
00:56:41,297 --> 00:56:42,389
Okay.

791
00:56:45,301 --> 00:56:46,529
The moment of truth.

792
00:56:57,814 --> 00:56:59,145
Can I make a toast?

793
00:56:59,215 --> 00:57:00,204
Sure.

794
00:57:03,019 --> 00:57:06,011
To the only dinner party
this house has ever known,

795
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:09,684
and to you, Nora,
for being a part of it.

796
00:57:09,759 --> 00:57:11,488
That was beautiful, Ray.

797
00:57:11,561 --> 00:57:12,550
Thank you.

798
00:57:24,007 --> 00:57:26,601
You sit in the chair there,
and I'll sit on the floor.

799
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:34,781
Sorry all the proper furniture's gone.

800
00:57:34,851 --> 00:57:36,478
Yeah, it'd be nice

801
00:57:36,553 --> 00:57:38,885
if there was a place
we could be comfortable.

802
00:57:38,955 --> 00:57:39,979
Yeah.

803
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:58,668
Whoa, nearly 8:45.

804
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:02,377
Both got to work tomorrow
and everything.

805
00:58:02,445 --> 00:58:05,005
Actually, tomorrow's my day off.

806
00:58:06,516 --> 00:58:07,676
Is that a fact?

807
00:58:12,722 --> 00:58:14,121
Seem warm in here?

808
00:58:16,192 --> 00:58:17,716
I think it's fine, Ray.

809
00:58:18,728 --> 00:58:19,956
It's fine.

810
00:58:23,366 --> 00:58:24,458
What's that light?

811
00:58:25,768 --> 00:58:27,030
There, out front.

812
00:58:39,749 --> 00:58:41,046
Oh, Ray.

813
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:46,554
Things are gonna have
to change around here, Nora.

814
00:58:47,891 --> 00:58:49,381
<i>And he wasn't kidding.</i>

815
00:58:49,459 --> 00:58:50,790
<i>Everyone was gettin' fed up</i>

816
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:53,192
<i>with the whole deal in this town,</i>
<i>including me.</i>

817
00:58:53,263 --> 00:58:54,890
Where am I dropping you, Ray?

818
00:58:54,964 --> 00:58:56,329
Got to get in to work.

819
00:58:57,433 --> 00:59:00,630
Insurance guy said he'd drop
the check by end of the day.

820
00:59:00,703 --> 00:59:03,365
What kind of car you think
600 bucks buys these days?

821
00:59:04,374 --> 00:59:05,898
More than my Gremlin.

822
00:59:08,645 --> 00:59:10,442
Elmo, pull over a sec.

823
00:59:30,333 --> 00:59:32,528
- Merl?
- Damn.

824
00:59:38,708 --> 00:59:41,336
Son of a bitch.
Elmo, give me a hand here.

825
00:59:45,782 --> 00:59:46,976
Be right there.

826
00:59:47,050 --> 00:59:50,213
I'll get you.
Today would be nice.

827
00:59:51,721 --> 00:59:53,746
That punk Dirk.

828
00:59:53,823 --> 00:59:55,188
I got him good, though.

829
00:59:55,258 --> 00:59:57,226
I think I might've broken his nose.

830
00:59:57,293 --> 00:59:59,318
His... jerks...

831
01:00:00,330 --> 01:00:03,094
they just held me down,
beat the shit out of me.

832
01:00:03,166 --> 01:00:05,134
We gotta get you
to a hospital, Merl.

833
01:00:05,201 --> 01:00:07,635
No, just take me home.
My missus will clean me up.

834
01:00:24,621 --> 01:00:26,282
Quite a place you got here, Merl.

835
01:00:26,356 --> 01:00:27,516
Thank you, Ray.

836
01:00:28,858 --> 01:00:30,189
- Oh, honey.
- Oh, my word.

837
01:00:30,259 --> 01:00:31,726
There she is, my darling.

838
01:00:31,794 --> 01:00:34,854
What happened to you?
I have been worried sick.

839
01:00:34,931 --> 01:00:37,729
Bunch of thugs beat up
on your pop at the gas station.

840
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:39,324
Her pop?

841
01:00:39,402 --> 01:00:40,835
This is my old lady, son.

842
01:00:40,903 --> 01:00:43,736
I told you about
having big dreams, Ray.

843
01:00:43,806 --> 01:00:45,899
- Come on.
- Okay. Oh...

844
01:00:45,975 --> 01:00:47,567
Honey, I need a hot bath.

845
01:00:49,746 --> 01:00:53,443
Oh, yeah, honey, come on.
Gonna take care of Daddy?

846
01:00:53,516 --> 01:00:54,574
My goodness.

847
01:00:55,585 --> 01:00:56,574
Damn.

848
01:01:08,931 --> 01:01:10,796
Evening, gentlemen.

849
01:01:10,867 --> 01:01:12,198
Hi, Nora.

850
01:01:12,268 --> 01:01:14,759
Hey.
That the new car?

851
01:01:14,837 --> 01:01:18,364
Barely runs.
It'll be fine once we get done with it.

852
01:01:18,441 --> 01:01:20,909
Sorry to barge in on you,
but I could use some help.

853
01:01:20,977 --> 01:01:23,002
Sure. That's nice.
Where'd you get that?

854
01:01:23,079 --> 01:01:25,639
Thrift store in Ridgecrest.
You want to help me get it inside?

855
01:01:25,715 --> 01:01:26,807
Let me go lock up.

856
01:01:26,883 --> 01:01:29,818
No. It's for you, Ray.

857
01:01:31,554 --> 01:01:32,816
You got this for me?

858
01:01:34,424 --> 01:01:36,016
How come?

859
01:01:36,092 --> 01:01:39,391
Just thought it'd be nice for you
to have a place to get comfortable

860
01:01:39,462 --> 01:01:43,865
so you can have company,
to chat and things.

861
01:01:43,933 --> 01:01:45,093
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

862
01:01:47,670 --> 01:01:49,297
Think you could give
us a hand, Den?

863
01:01:49,372 --> 01:01:51,397
Got a couple of long necks
with your name on 'em.

864
01:01:52,408 --> 01:01:53,807
You got yourself a deal.

865
01:01:53,876 --> 01:01:55,400
Heavy little thing.

866
01:01:57,814 --> 01:02:00,282
Dang if that don't look just great.

867
01:02:00,349 --> 01:02:02,544
Man, that was quite a workout.

868
01:02:03,886 --> 01:02:05,217
I sure am thirsty.

869
01:02:05,288 --> 01:02:07,620
Oh, right.
Got you covered.

870
01:02:10,693 --> 01:02:11,853
Damn.

871
01:02:12,929 --> 01:02:15,397
This place is
a hell of a lot nicer than my hole.

872
01:02:18,968 --> 01:02:20,492
You know, I was thinking

873
01:02:20,570 --> 01:02:24,472
maybe me and you could
get together sometime...

874
01:02:26,008 --> 01:02:27,498
reminisce.

875
01:02:28,611 --> 01:02:29,908
About what?

876
01:02:30,947 --> 01:02:32,141
Here you go, Den.

877
01:02:32,215 --> 01:02:33,944
Oh, bitchin'.

878
01:02:34,016 --> 01:02:35,278
See you guys later.

879
01:02:37,987 --> 01:02:39,420
He's a character, that boy.

880
01:02:39,489 --> 01:02:41,218
He's harmless enough.

881
01:02:41,290 --> 01:02:43,087
His wife's another kettle of fish.

882
01:02:43,159 --> 01:02:45,184
- Was she in our class?
- Not for very long.

883
01:02:45,261 --> 01:02:48,662
Think she got thrown out for beating up
the vice principal or something.

884
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:52,097
Take it for a test drive.

885
01:03:00,143 --> 01:03:01,405
Well, what do you think?

886
01:03:01,477 --> 01:03:02,569
Feels good.

887
01:03:02,645 --> 01:03:04,306
Mmm, yeah.

888
01:03:08,684 --> 01:03:10,379
You're awful sweet, aren't you?

889
01:03:11,387 --> 01:03:13,184
Well, you tell me.

890
01:03:13,256 --> 01:03:14,780
Well, I think you are, yeah.

891
01:03:16,259 --> 01:03:17,521
Real sweet.

892
01:03:24,066 --> 01:03:26,227
Well, I didn't mean
to barge in like this...

893
01:03:27,603 --> 01:03:30,231
so you just enjoy
this here sofa,

894
01:03:30,306 --> 01:03:33,742
and maybe sometime
we'll get to share it together again.

895
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:36,836
I don't think I'll let anyone else
sit on it except for you and me.

896
01:03:38,014 --> 01:03:39,572
What's so funny?
I'm serious.

897
01:03:41,651 --> 01:03:43,516
Now, why are you looking
at me like that?

898
01:03:43,586 --> 01:03:46,214
- Like what?
- Just like that.

899
01:03:46,289 --> 01:03:49,053
Like I got something in my teeth.

900
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:53,026
Is that really
how I'm looking at you, Ray?

901
01:03:53,095 --> 01:03:55,893
Well, not exactly, I guess...

902
01:03:57,366 --> 01:03:59,834
but you sure look at me different
than any woman ever has.

903
01:03:59,902 --> 01:04:01,631
Oh, now...

904
01:04:01,704 --> 01:04:02,898
What's that about?

905
01:04:04,373 --> 01:04:05,840
Well, maybe I'm just enjoying

906
01:04:05,908 --> 01:04:08,968
being able to sit with you face to face
after all these years.

907
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:12,445
How, until recently,
I hadn't got to spend

908
01:04:12,515 --> 01:04:16,451
more than five or ten minutes
at a time with you since 11th grade,

909
01:04:16,519 --> 01:04:18,316
but how that was enough for me.

910
01:04:25,194 --> 01:04:27,856
Well, as you like say,
you got to get up early, so...

911
01:04:27,930 --> 01:04:29,295
I ain't saying it now.

912
01:04:30,333 --> 01:04:32,665
Yeah, well, maybe I am.

913
01:04:38,875 --> 01:04:40,775
Hey, Nora, let's get loaded.

914
01:04:58,694 --> 01:05:01,629
...in front of my house.
Eddie, come with me.

915
01:05:01,697 --> 01:05:03,756
Get the fuck away
from my bike, man.

916
01:05:03,833 --> 01:05:04,822
Seriously.

917
01:05:04,901 --> 01:05:06,493
All right.
Let's go.

918
01:05:58,788 --> 01:06:00,312
Hurry up. Hurry up, man.

919
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:12,289
Take it.

920
01:07:05,221 --> 01:07:07,519
Spoonie, you keep a lookout.
Eddie, come with me.

921
01:07:12,661 --> 01:07:16,119
Goddamn it, what did I tell you
about doing that in front of me!

922
01:07:16,198 --> 01:07:17,324
What are you, six?

923
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:18,526
Sorry, Dirk.

924
01:07:18,601 --> 01:07:19,761
It's fucking gross.

925
01:07:22,872 --> 01:07:24,840
Which one of you inbreds
left the door unlocked?

926
01:07:26,342 --> 01:07:27,502
Where's the lock?

927
01:07:28,811 --> 01:07:30,972
- For what?
- For the door, you idiot.

928
01:07:32,782 --> 01:07:35,649
- I ain't no idiot.
- You're such a fucking idiot!

929
01:07:35,718 --> 01:07:36,844
You're an idiot.

930
01:07:36,919 --> 01:07:38,511
- What?
- What?

931
01:07:59,041 --> 01:08:03,637
Denny, hey, dumbass!
The power's off again.

932
01:08:03,712 --> 01:08:06,340
- Denny!
- All right, woman, I hear you.

933
01:08:07,850 --> 01:08:10,717
Hey, Ray?
Power's off again.

934
01:08:10,786 --> 01:08:11,980
So's the water.

935
01:08:12,054 --> 01:08:13,612
Ray, I'm current on the rent.

936
01:08:13,689 --> 01:08:16,385
I swear everybody
in the neighborhood's all paid, too.

937
01:08:17,460 --> 01:08:19,325
Did you take out
the goddamn batteries?

938
01:08:19,395 --> 01:08:21,260
I think it's a plug-in.

939
01:08:21,330 --> 01:08:22,695
Plug it in to fucking what?

940
01:08:24,967 --> 01:08:28,960
Hello. I'm sweating
my balls off out here.

941
01:08:29,038 --> 01:08:32,405
Yeah, I was right in the middle
of my weekly shower.

942
01:08:32,475 --> 01:08:35,603
Well, there's nothing
we can do about it tonight, so...

943
01:08:35,678 --> 01:08:37,976
How abouts we just don't
pay our rents no more?

944
01:08:38,047 --> 01:08:40,777
- He'll have to do what we says.
- Want to risk being thrown out?

945
01:08:40,850 --> 01:08:43,683
- Where you gonna move, Den?
- In with you.

946
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:46,683
Then what are we supposed to do?

947
01:08:48,991 --> 01:08:50,754
You all just cope a little while,

948
01:08:50,826 --> 01:08:52,760
and we'll get squared soon,
I promise.

949
01:09:08,444 --> 01:09:09,672
Fucking...

950
01:09:11,046 --> 01:09:12,070
Bitch!

951
01:09:14,383 --> 01:09:15,975
Go to town and get the Huggies.

952
01:09:16,051 --> 01:09:17,450
Bitch, what do you think I'm doing?

953
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:20,011
- I'm a responsible-ass father.
- I asked you five hours ago.

954
01:09:20,089 --> 01:09:21,954
I know what the hell
I'm supposed to be doing.

955
01:09:22,024 --> 01:09:23,252
Get the Huggies!

956
01:09:23,325 --> 01:09:25,555
Just mind your own babies,
goddamn it.

957
01:09:53,789 --> 01:09:54,778
What?

958
01:09:54,857 --> 01:09:56,825
You wanna work off
the rent money you owe me?

959
01:09:58,294 --> 01:09:59,591
Like a... a job?

960
01:09:59,662 --> 01:10:03,655
Take this list, go in to Ridgecrest
to a Supply Sergeant.

961
01:10:03,732 --> 01:10:06,064
Well, Ray, I'm sort of busy today.

962
01:10:06,135 --> 01:10:08,069
Too bad.
Do it.

963
01:10:08,137 --> 01:10:09,866
Be at my house, 11:00.

964
01:10:10,973 --> 01:10:12,804
And tell Selma to bring her A game.

965
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:20,981
Scotty. Scotty.

966
01:10:22,985 --> 01:10:24,919
Got a little assignment for you.

967
01:10:28,324 --> 01:10:30,952
Don't you think "Happy Days"
is just the best?

968
01:10:32,094 --> 01:10:34,392
It is awfully good.

969
01:10:34,463 --> 01:10:36,055
There's no denying it.

970
01:10:39,235 --> 01:10:42,102
We really do have quite a lot
in common, don't you think?

971
01:10:43,272 --> 01:10:44,534
I do, Ray.

972
01:10:52,948 --> 01:10:55,007
Special Ops to the rescue.

973
01:10:58,554 --> 01:11:03,423
Now, Ray, this may be a little short,
but I let out the crotch.

974
01:11:08,931 --> 01:11:11,126
Den, there's just no way.

975
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:12,690
- No?
- No.

976
01:11:13,702 --> 01:11:15,033
Just a thought.

977
01:11:20,309 --> 01:11:22,436
Well, it's not
a Junior Miss pageant, Ray.

978
01:11:23,445 --> 01:11:24,503
Door's open.

979
01:11:26,582 --> 01:11:28,140
Hey, kids.

980
01:11:28,217 --> 01:11:29,479
Thanks for showing, Merl.

981
01:11:29,551 --> 01:11:31,143
I wouldn't miss this for the world.

982
01:11:31,220 --> 01:11:34,314
I can't wait to chew that jerk
a new set of butt cheeks.

983
01:11:34,390 --> 01:11:36,722
Howdy, folks.
Am I late?

984
01:11:36,792 --> 01:11:39,317
- Right on time.
- Well, how cool is that?

985
01:11:39,395 --> 01:11:42,023
I don't think I've been on time
my whole life.

986
01:11:45,567 --> 01:11:47,899
Who invited
the Chippendales reject?

987
01:11:47,970 --> 01:11:49,733
Scotty, you forget to change?

988
01:11:51,073 --> 01:11:53,769
Never mind.
Running behind schedule.

989
01:11:56,312 --> 01:11:57,745
Hey, everybody.

990
01:11:57,813 --> 01:12:00,577
Heard you folks need
a little ass kicked.

991
01:12:01,583 --> 01:12:05,383
Coming up on 2300 hours.
Everyone clear on their mission?

992
01:12:06,422 --> 01:12:08,014
- You bet.
- Yeah.

993
01:12:08,090 --> 01:12:10,888
All right, then.
Let's light this candle.

994
01:12:10,959 --> 01:12:11,789
Right.

995
01:12:12,828 --> 01:12:13,886
Okay, let's go.

996
01:12:15,698 --> 01:12:17,928
What has gotten into you,
Ray Tuckby?

997
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,594
Life, Nora.
Life's gotten into me.

998
01:12:28,043 --> 01:12:30,477
<i>I mean, can you just imagine</i>
<i>these dinosaurs thundering</i>

999
01:12:30,546 --> 01:12:33,640
<i>over the Earth in the Jurassic age?</i>

1000
01:12:33,716 --> 01:12:34,876
<i>Here we go.</i>

1001
01:12:37,419 --> 01:12:39,614
Let's go over here.
Get down.

1002
01:12:41,857 --> 01:12:43,722
Twenty bucks says it won't go off.

1003
01:12:45,327 --> 01:12:48,353
Make it 30, and it's a deal.

1004
01:12:54,002 --> 01:12:55,663
I'll have to owe you the extra ten.

1005
01:12:59,208 --> 01:13:01,335
Okay, I guess.

1006
01:13:05,748 --> 01:13:06,772
What the heck?

1007
01:13:06,849 --> 01:13:09,682
Didn't Dirk say nobody
was allowed up here?

1008
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:19,159
Excuse me.

1009
01:13:19,228 --> 01:13:22,129
I'm lost, and I cannot find my way.

1010
01:13:23,198 --> 01:13:24,961
Where you trying to get to?

1011
01:13:25,033 --> 01:13:26,398
Bakersfield.

1012
01:13:28,003 --> 01:13:31,666
Highway is just down yonder.

1013
01:13:31,740 --> 01:13:33,765
How can I ever repay you?

1014
01:13:55,831 --> 01:13:57,355
Hey, what are you doing here?

1015
01:14:02,805 --> 01:14:04,170
Coming!

1016
01:14:05,174 --> 01:14:06,163
Yeah?

1017
01:14:08,644 --> 01:14:10,942
Hey there! Excuse me.

1018
01:14:12,948 --> 01:14:15,280
What the hell you doing?
Get out of my house!

1019
01:14:26,662 --> 01:14:28,596
Never did appreciate that breed.

1020
01:14:44,413 --> 01:14:46,881
That's quite a talent
your wife's got there.

1021
01:14:48,417 --> 01:14:50,282
She do parties as well?

1022
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:53,283
Knock it off, you perv.

1023
01:14:53,355 --> 01:14:55,380
- Is he dead?
- Candy, get out here!

1024
01:14:55,457 --> 01:14:56,719
There's a dead guy.

1025
01:14:56,792 --> 01:14:58,692
Shut up!
You'll wake the baby.

1026
01:14:58,760 --> 01:15:00,625
Boy, am I glad Denny shoots blanks.

1027
01:15:02,030 --> 01:15:03,019
Okay, let's go.

1028
01:15:03,098 --> 01:15:05,498
I'll hand him up to you.
You start loading the truck.

1029
01:15:05,567 --> 01:15:08,434
Just so you know,
babies give me the heebie-jeebies.

1030
01:15:11,740 --> 01:15:13,935
Good job, Den.
Come on.

1031
01:15:17,279 --> 01:15:18,439
Come on.

1032
01:15:30,626 --> 01:15:32,491
Remember, Selma, be gentle.

1033
01:15:33,529 --> 01:15:34,655
Go on.

1034
01:15:37,633 --> 01:15:39,066
Yuck.

1035
01:15:42,638 --> 01:15:44,230
So what's it gonna be, tough guy?

1036
01:15:44,306 --> 01:15:46,103
Join the resistance
or get vaporized?

1037
01:15:52,281 --> 01:15:54,579
That's our cue.
Come on.

1038
01:15:54,650 --> 01:15:56,083
Just another minute.

1039
01:15:56,151 --> 01:15:57,482
Well, here goes.

1040
01:15:57,553 --> 01:16:00,113
Gonna make ourselves
a whole new future, gentlemen.

1041
01:16:01,990 --> 01:16:03,048
What's wrong?

1042
01:16:03,125 --> 01:16:06,617
I was just kinda hoping
I could push the button, Mr. Tuckby.

1043
01:16:07,629 --> 01:16:09,597
I really like blowin' shit up.

1044
01:16:09,665 --> 01:16:12,634
All right, but
no funny business, you hear?

1045
01:16:12,701 --> 01:16:14,032
Tits!

1046
01:16:18,273 --> 01:16:20,138
Get the truck
and take him to the dump.

1047
01:16:21,009 --> 01:16:22,203
For real, Dirk?

1048
01:16:22,277 --> 01:16:23,972
Deal with it, goddamn it!

1049
01:16:24,046 --> 01:16:26,913
This is for calling me an idiot
every day of my life, Dirk.

1050
01:16:34,790 --> 01:16:36,815
Go get a potato sack and some twine.

1051
01:16:36,892 --> 01:16:38,450
I'll go get the truck.

1052
01:16:42,998 --> 01:16:44,192
What the... hey!

1053
01:16:46,501 --> 01:16:49,527
That's for giving me
heat rash, mo-fo.

1054
01:16:49,605 --> 01:16:50,799
<i>It can go boy, it can go girl.</i>

1055
01:16:50,872 --> 01:16:53,136
Scotty, you do whatever
the hell you want with him.

1056
01:16:53,208 --> 01:16:55,733
<i>It's not just for a girly girl</i>
<i>or a boy.</i>

1057
01:16:56,778 --> 01:16:57,745
Do it again.

1058
01:17:11,493 --> 01:17:13,188
Oh, my Lord.

1059
01:17:13,261 --> 01:17:15,229
I think I fudged my pants.

1060
01:17:22,504 --> 01:17:23,766
Oh, those babies.

1061
01:17:23,839 --> 01:17:26,273
I just want to eat them up,
they're so precious.

1062
01:17:33,081 --> 01:17:34,605
There it is.

1063
01:17:38,353 --> 01:17:40,082
Shit, man, that was fun.

1064
01:17:43,025 --> 01:17:44,617
My God, we've done good, Ray.

1065
01:17:46,061 --> 01:17:49,292
Just like that game we won
against Solvang back in '89

1066
01:17:49,364 --> 01:17:53,323
when I made that key block
and basically walked into the end zone.

1067
01:17:54,870 --> 01:17:56,804
You remember, right, Ray?

1068
01:17:56,872 --> 01:17:58,032
My key block?

1069
01:17:59,141 --> 01:18:02,975
<i>Turned out the little twerp</i>
<i>wasn't that hard to take down.</i>

1070
01:18:03,045 --> 01:18:06,173
<i>Just a bit of guts</i>
<i>and determination from all of us,</i>

1071
01:18:06,248 --> 01:18:11,276
<i>Dirk and company went over faster</i>
<i>than a one-legged cat in a sand box.</i>

1072
01:18:16,258 --> 01:18:17,850
Let us down!

1073
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:26,126
Good job, guys.

1074
01:18:26,201 --> 01:18:27,668
Pleasure's right here, Ray.

1075
01:18:29,971 --> 01:18:32,439
Get this thing off of me.
Somebody help!

1076
01:18:33,542 --> 01:18:35,476
That hurts, goddamn it.

1077
01:18:37,813 --> 01:18:39,542
Let's get the record straight, punk.

1078
01:18:39,614 --> 01:18:41,275
You're going to apologize right now

1079
01:18:41,349 --> 01:18:44,477
for making life a dark, ugly experience
in this here community,

1080
01:18:44,553 --> 01:18:46,612
or Scotty's going to teach you
what true pain is.

1081
01:18:46,688 --> 01:18:48,155
We clear?

1082
01:18:48,223 --> 01:18:49,281
Eat me.

1083
01:18:50,592 --> 01:18:52,287
Got another surprise for you.

1084
01:18:52,360 --> 01:18:53,190
Merl?

1085
01:18:55,530 --> 01:18:58,260
Sasquatch Two,
this is Sasquatch One.

1086
01:18:58,333 --> 01:19:00,460
We're ready
for Operation Clean Sweep.

1087
01:19:00,535 --> 01:19:01,900
<i>Roger that, Sasquatch One.</i>

1088
01:19:01,970 --> 01:19:05,462
You and your cohorts
are going to take a nice long time out.

1089
01:19:05,540 --> 01:19:06,529
Gentlemen.

1090
01:19:06,608 --> 01:19:08,633
No fucking way.
I didn't do nothing.

1091
01:19:08,710 --> 01:19:10,371
Well, we don't see it that way.

1092
01:19:13,048 --> 01:19:14,743
Take care now.

1093
01:19:14,816 --> 01:19:15,840
Somebody help me.

1094
01:19:17,519 --> 01:19:20,886
Candy, Tammy, Wanda, Jeanine?

1095
01:19:20,956 --> 01:19:24,790
I made this town.
I made this town what it is.

1096
01:19:24,860 --> 01:19:26,919
You all have roofs over your head
because of me,

1097
01:19:26,995 --> 01:19:28,792
all of your ugly-ass heads.

1098
01:19:28,864 --> 01:19:31,458
Oh, no.
He's gonna be crying.

1099
01:19:31,533 --> 01:19:34,468
He's going to prison,
gonna learn his lesson.

1100
01:19:34,536 --> 01:19:37,471
He's off.
Oh, hey.

1101
01:19:37,539 --> 01:19:39,302
Hey, hold on, hold on.

1102
01:19:39,374 --> 01:19:41,501
Can I just say a few more things?

1103
01:19:42,744 --> 01:19:45,235
What if I, like, turn over
a whole new loaf,

1104
01:19:45,313 --> 01:19:47,144
or whatever that is,
and I'll change?

1105
01:19:47,215 --> 01:19:48,239
Sorry, Spoon.

1106
01:19:48,316 --> 01:19:51,217
You go clean up and come back,
and we'll make nice, deal?

1107
01:19:51,286 --> 01:19:53,811
All right, deal.
Wait, you're pinching my wrist.

1108
01:20:13,074 --> 01:20:16,168
Ray, you know, my wife is
in need of a little rehab herself.

1109
01:20:16,244 --> 01:20:18,610
I was thinking maybe
we could put her on a bus.

1110
01:20:18,680 --> 01:20:20,875
You're gonna have
to deal with that on your own.

1111
01:20:22,784 --> 01:20:25,048
God, I hate to piss that woman off.

1112
01:20:30,025 --> 01:20:31,583
Right on schedule.

1113
01:20:34,095 --> 01:20:36,063
Those girls over there.

1114
01:20:36,131 --> 01:20:37,462
Well, Ray...

1115
01:20:37,532 --> 01:20:39,022
I'll see you around.

1116
01:20:55,617 --> 01:20:57,448
Well, what now, Ray?

1117
01:20:58,887 --> 01:21:00,684
I guess that's up to us.

1118
01:21:07,195 --> 01:21:08,822
<i>You know how they say</i>

1119
01:21:08,897 --> 01:21:12,628
<i>"The more things change,</i>
<i>the more they stay the same"?</i>

1120
01:21:16,137 --> 01:21:17,365
<i>Well...</i>

1121
01:21:43,832 --> 01:21:46,096
Can you believe this?

1122
01:22:03,018 --> 01:22:04,952
Sounds nice.

1123
01:22:09,691 --> 01:22:10,851
Nora...

1124
01:22:13,895 --> 01:22:16,523
Remember awhile back,
you asked me why I never left Trona?

1125
01:22:16,598 --> 01:22:19,066
Yes, I do.

1126
01:22:19,134 --> 01:22:23,036
Well, it was 'cause of you.

1127
01:22:24,172 --> 01:22:26,732
This place is hell, Nora,

1128
01:22:26,808 --> 01:22:29,709
but knowing I'd get to come through
that Rite-Valu door every day

1129
01:22:29,778 --> 01:22:32,178
and see your sweet face
made it paradise.

1130
01:22:33,448 --> 01:22:34,642
Ditto.

1131
01:22:44,826 --> 01:22:46,350
What the hey was that?

1132
01:22:48,229 --> 01:22:49,992
It's called a French kiss.

1133
01:22:50,065 --> 01:22:51,259
A what?

1134
01:22:52,267 --> 01:22:55,259
It's a little more intimate
than a regular kiss.

1135
01:22:55,337 --> 01:22:58,932
I read about it recently
in one of those Harlequin books

1136
01:22:59,007 --> 01:23:01,567
over in the miscellaneous section,
aisle three.

1137
01:23:01,643 --> 01:23:03,338
It sure was different.

1138
01:23:04,346 --> 01:23:05,745
Kind of like a toothbrush...

1139
01:23:06,748 --> 01:23:07,772
but I liked it.

1140
01:23:08,783 --> 01:23:10,774
You can try it if you want to.

1141
01:23:10,852 --> 01:23:11,978
Okay.

1142
01:23:13,621 --> 01:23:14,645
You sure?

1143
01:23:14,723 --> 01:23:17,157
Whatever you're comfortable with.

1144
01:23:26,334 --> 01:23:27,892
I think I'm getting the hang of it.

1145
01:24:09,577 --> 01:24:11,772
<i>There are two types of heroes.</i>

1146
01:24:11,846 --> 01:24:14,007
<i>One changes himself,</i>

1147
01:24:14,082 --> 01:24:16,846
<i>the other changes</i>
<i>those around him.</i>

1148
01:24:16,918 --> 01:24:18,886
Is that some of your
famous lemon meringue?

1149
01:24:18,953 --> 01:24:20,978
Recipe's been in my family
for generations.

1150
01:24:21,056 --> 01:24:22,080
Bring on a slice or two.

1151
01:24:22,157 --> 01:24:23,317
Coming right up. Den?

1152
01:24:23,391 --> 01:24:26,952
<i>Well, I guess in the end,</i>
<i>Ray was both.</i>

1153
01:24:27,028 --> 01:24:28,188
I'll help you, darling.

1154
01:24:28,263 --> 01:24:30,026
Right this way, folks.

1155
01:24:33,535 --> 01:24:35,799
R'ch'lle, you're doing a great job.

1156
01:24:38,940 --> 01:24:40,635
How's the back holding up, hon?

1157
01:24:40,708 --> 01:24:42,198
Just fine, Ray.

1158
01:24:43,745 --> 01:24:47,146
Eddie, I think we're gonna need
to add another pastry chef.

1159
01:24:47,215 --> 01:24:48,682
I'm already on it, Pop.

1160
01:24:50,852 --> 01:24:54,686
Hey, where can a man and his missus
get something to eat around here?

1161
01:24:55,757 --> 01:24:58,089
- How have you been, friend?
- Ray, how you doin'?

1162
01:24:58,159 --> 01:25:00,184
It looks like
we're on the same schedule.

1163
01:25:00,261 --> 01:25:02,092
- Nora, you look really nice.
- Hi.

1164
01:25:02,163 --> 01:25:03,528
- You know Angel?
- Yes. Hi.

1165
01:25:03,598 --> 01:25:05,361
Well, we were just driving around,

1166
01:25:05,433 --> 01:25:07,264
and we thought
maybe we'd come to see

1167
01:25:07,335 --> 01:25:09,462
what kind of progress
you were making.

1168
01:25:09,537 --> 01:25:13,496
I wanna tell you, Ray,
you got it all.

1169
01:25:13,575 --> 01:25:15,167
I am so proud of you.

1170
01:25:15,243 --> 01:25:17,643
Well, couldn't have done it
without you.

1171
01:25:17,712 --> 01:25:19,373
I know that.

1172
01:25:21,015 --> 01:25:23,540
How about a table
for a couple hungry people?

1173
01:25:23,618 --> 01:25:25,279
Oh, by the way,

1174
01:25:25,353 --> 01:25:28,049
I heard that meringue is to die for.

1175
01:25:31,025 --> 01:25:32,049
Right this way.

1176
01:25:33,361 --> 01:25:37,991
<i>Maybe the American dream</i>
does <i>still exist,</i>

1177
01:25:38,066 --> 01:25:40,398
<i>even for my friend Ray...</i>

1178
01:25:40,468 --> 01:25:44,007
<i>and even in a place like Trona.</i>
