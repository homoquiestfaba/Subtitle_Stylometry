1
00:00:25,518 --> 00:00:27,513
Right now this is not working.

2
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:29,580
I am sorry.

3
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:34,448
You need to find a way
that works for both of us.

4
00:00:35,463 --> 00:00:37,150
We have done enough for you.

5
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:39,680
Okay?

6
00:00:44,053 --> 00:00:45,720
You do not have anything to say?

7
00:00:51,068 --> 00:00:53,120
I find this very embarrassing.

8
00:01:05,245 --> 00:01:06,315
Up and over, Alex.

9
00:01:06,318 --> 00:01:07,318
That's it.

10
00:01:08,131 --> 00:01:09,535
Good. Good, good...

11
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:13,170
Morning.

12
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:17,860
Nice. Deep, deep breathing.

13
00:01:18,048 --> 00:01:19,115
Good...

14
00:01:19,678 --> 00:01:20,536
Lovely.

15
00:01:20,652 --> 00:01:21,652
Thank you.

16
00:01:26,776 --> 00:01:29,602
Start pulling those ribs
down, your scapulas down...

17
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:31,050
Connect.

18
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,300
To fourth, please.

19
00:02:09,693 --> 00:02:11,080
This is an argument.

20
00:02:11,634 --> 00:02:12,066
Okay?

21
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,260
Can I please see something happening?
Anything?

22
00:02:14,573 --> 00:02:15,980
Take it from the grand jeté again.

23
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,710
Just do something today.

24
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:20,440
Why are we in this room?

25
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:29,600
Extend... More, more, more, more, more!

26
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:44,920
Hold, hold, hold!

27
00:02:45,192 --> 00:02:47,520
Like this, right here... these
are very simple moves.

28
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,240
It's a développé. Big
deal. Anybody can do one.

29
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:52,050
Why are you doing it? What's going on?

30
00:02:52,269 --> 00:02:54,920
This is the example of the tension
that is going on between you.

31
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:57,720
So you have to pull
that leg... Work for it.

32
00:02:57,741 --> 00:02:59,365
Rather than just going
'bom' and leaving it there.

33
00:02:59,389 --> 00:03:00,540
There's nothing happening.

34
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:03,500
It's really, really boring guys.
I'm sorry to say this, but...

35
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:14,930
Hey. I... I think your jump
should be more parabolic.

36
00:03:15,597 --> 00:03:17,200
Less like a bullet from a gun.

37
00:03:18,082 --> 00:03:20,962
Like when you bring your body
weight forward, you shouldn't plunge.

38
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:23,300
And I think you would land a lot better.

39
00:03:52,488 --> 00:03:59,656
And like, okay, maybe I'm not gonna the nicest,
cute little girl at the freakin' job everyday...

40
00:04:01,965 --> 00:04:03,336
Maybe it's because I don't like my job.

41
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,240
Maybe it's because it's a shitty job.

42
00:04:07,016 --> 00:04:08,040
Which isn't my fault.

43
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:12,290
At least I'm in fucking
school, gettin' that education...

44
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:14,010
On.

45
00:04:15,293 --> 00:04:19,220
Get myself together, get
that degree, get the better job.

46
00:04:19,389 --> 00:04:23,900
And they'll still be at that stupid
fuckin' job, laughing at the cool girl.

47
00:04:25,368 --> 00:04:26,368
You know?

48
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,048
I don't fuckin' care.

49
00:04:34,429 --> 00:04:35,549
Can you get me another beer?

50
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,200
You know?

51
00:07:28,274 --> 00:07:30,820
Hey. Do you mind if we sit here?

52
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:33,200
And then... and then she started
getting on my shit, like, uh, fuckin'...

53
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,560
'Why are you at a dance
club... a music club?'

54
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:38,480
'Like, how do you... you
can't even hear the music.'

55
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,756
Did you say that you felt it?

56
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:40,780
Yeah.

57
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:46,460
'And I was like, 'I can't hear
the music, but I can feel it!'

58
00:08:48,706 --> 00:08:49,933
I'm still talking like that.

59
00:08:51,501 --> 00:08:52,501
And then, uh...

60
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:54,370
Who are you?

61
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:55,420
Fuckin'...

62
00:08:57,810 --> 00:08:58,810
Who is...?

63
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:08,300
It would've been
fantastic if you didn't get it.

64
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:10,690
I'm a pro.

65
00:09:11,281 --> 00:09:12,281
I'm a pro.

66
00:09:18,834 --> 00:09:20,770
This is a good song. I like this song.

67
00:09:22,655 --> 00:09:23,660
Pass the joint.

68
00:09:24,531 --> 00:09:26,040
Alright, give me a second.

69
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:38,110
This music is so good.

70
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:41,310
Not as good as the weed in Cali.

71
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,720
You people and the fuckin' weed in Cali.

72
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:48,170
The weed gets you high in New
York and it gets you high in Cali.

73
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:49,910
It's the same fuckin' shit.

74
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:51,010
It's just weed.

75
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:54,810
It's the hydroponics. It's the rigs.

76
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:56,910
It's the detail.

77
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,280
It's the WEED.

78
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:01,720
So Cecilia, how do you know Tom?

79
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:04,790
I'm his sister.

80
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:10,650
She's not my sister. We go way back.

81
00:10:11,891 --> 00:10:12,939
That's cool.

82
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:25,920
I can't understand you.

83
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:29,470
Tiff, just...

84
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,840
No!

85
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:34,550
This fuckin' bitch.

86
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,180
Let's see them moves, dancer girl.

87
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,240
What?

88
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,330
Let's see what you got.

89
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,220
What are you talking about?

90
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:47,080
The fuck you go to Baltimore for?

91
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:48,110
Let's see it.

92
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,500
You got all seven second
of my attention span.

93
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:58,780
Is this it?

94
00:10:59,504 --> 00:11:00,504
Is this what you learned?

95
00:11:06,856 --> 00:11:07,900
Fuckin' vibe killer.

96
00:12:01,573 --> 00:12:02,640
Fuck those guys.

97
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,020
I could've done it... I could've taken 'em!

98
00:12:07,088 --> 00:12:08,230
Where are we going?

99
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:41,420
He's such a good guy
though. Like, trust me.

100
00:12:41,507 --> 00:12:45,000
If we still had Myspace,
you'd totally be on my Top Ten.

101
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:47,140
Maybe, like, number eleven.

102
00:13:45,193 --> 00:13:46,490
Alright, alright, right.

103
00:13:48,301 --> 00:13:49,301
You look...

104
00:13:51,576 --> 00:13:52,576
Healthy.

105
00:13:53,933 --> 00:13:56,205
At least I don't look boring like you.

106
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:57,610
Oh, shit.

107
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:08,800
You know, I thought
I finally got rid of you.

108
00:14:10,184 --> 00:14:11,370
Aren't you glad I'm back?

109
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,760
Yeah...

110
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:24,830
You know that... It's kind of funny.

111
00:14:25,682 --> 00:14:26,682
What?

112
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,500
You went to go live your
dream in Baltimore, right?

113
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,320
Well, I don't know, it's like...

114
00:14:33,064 --> 00:14:34,064
It's kinda...

115
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:38,098
It's cute, but it's,
like, sort of pathetic.

116
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:46,320
Yo, let me hit that shit.

117
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,400
Cecilia Romero.

118
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:58,640
What are you doing here, baby?

119
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:03,220
I call you and I text you
and you never text me back...

120
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,860
Because you left me.

121
00:15:04,989 --> 00:15:06,109
I'm sorry.

122
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,010
Did you know that I'm teaching now?

123
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:14,710
Um, by that place by the
White Castle... by the J Train!

124
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:16,250
Where we used to hang out...

125
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:21,000
Where I would be puking my fucking
guts out, and you would be dragging me...

126
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:30,940
So cute!

127
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:36,450
That guy Julian over
there wants to fuck you.

128
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,780
I know.

129
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,890
Hey, Ceelers.

130
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:45,230
Hi, Benni.

131
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:51,700
I miss you, Ceelers.

132
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:33,430
Ceelers?

133
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:37,510
Just checking if you're there.

134
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:42,410
Making sure you didn't leave me.

135
00:17:43,922 --> 00:17:45,698
You always leave me.

136
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:52,300
The tables have turned, haven't they.

137
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,870
Oh, god. Oh my god.

138
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:57,430
Oh my fucking god.

139
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:25,990
Where do you want me?

140
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:35,030
God... You taste so fucking good.

141
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:38,800
Are you serious? Is this real?

142
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:41,570
Wait, is this real? What did I do?

143
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,910
Easy, easy, easy...

144
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:47,740
Easy, easy slow rider!
Jesus christ, alright?

145
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:49,760
Hey.

146
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:56,290
I hope you don't mind a little
sprinkles on your birthday cone.

147
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:00,460
Oh, shit. What do you want from me?

148
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:03,410
Voilà.

149
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:05,380
Bon appétit.

150
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:13,270
What.

151
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:38,770
Stop!

152
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:41,820
Stop it!

153
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:44,190
Stop it!

154
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:41,220
Morning, stranger.

155
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,120
Hey.

156
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,640
You look like shit.

157
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:51,810
Sorry if we kept you up all night.

158
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:55,220
I didn't notice anything.

159
00:21:58,370 --> 00:21:59,370
That's good.

160
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:10,740
Hey, do you sleep in your funeral clothes?

161
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,570
You just eat my chin cupcake?

162
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:19,260
That's hot.

163
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:45,040
Hey, we're gonna go to Liv.
You going to be cool here?

164
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:52,200
Yeah, I'm fine.

165
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,440
Alright.

166
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:13,650
Let's go.

167
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:35,540
Oh my god.

168
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,640
Cecilia?

169
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:44,210
Are you watching?

170
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:47,720
I'm not watching anything.

171
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,720
Yeah, right.

172
00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:00,090
You could just say you wanted that.

173
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:02,140
Hm?

174
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,230
Said you could just say you want it.

175
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,600
What?

176
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:07,840
Shut up.

177
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:10,030
Don't say anything.

178
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:24,640
Don't fucking say anything.

179
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:35,420
Hi.

180
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:36,880
Hi.

181
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:41,890
What's up.

182
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:43,010
Nothing.

183
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,340
I got so fucked last night, dude.

184
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:50,760
So fucked.

185
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,790
Hi, Keanu Reeves.

186
00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:55,320
Do what you love, man, and let it kill you.

187
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:56,590
Hi.

188
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:06,930
Oh, sick espadrilles.

189
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:09,140
Those are really ugly, Jane.

190
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:20,820
Over, back, down, one plié.

191
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:26,320
Over, flat backs, up...

192
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,960
And again without me, guys.

193
00:25:29,810 --> 00:25:32,580
One, two, three...

194
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:38,810
Down...

195
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:40,850
Good.

196
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:44,260
Over and roll up.

197
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:45,810
Great job, guys.

198
00:25:50,810 --> 00:25:52,070
One plié.

199
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:35,850
I liked how energetic you were.

200
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:38,110
I thought that was really cool.

201
00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:43,970
Are you still auditioning and stuff?

202
00:28:44,610 --> 00:28:46,850
No way. Fuck that.

203
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:51,950
Rich, white assholes telling me what to do while
all the skinny bitches get the callbacks?

204
00:28:52,610 --> 00:28:53,700
No thank you.

205
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:00,310
The bags under my
eyes are getting really bad.

206
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:02,590
I don't think so.

207
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:04,250
They're getting really bad, bud.

208
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:08,330
Maybe you should stop getting
fucked up every single night.

209
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:09,510
Fuck that.

210
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:14,520
Maybe you should get plastic surgery.

211
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:18,030
Come on.

212
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:38,410
Hi!

213
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:39,040
Hi.

214
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,280
How are you?

215
00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:42,570
Hi, baby.

216
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:45,140
Hi, guys.

217
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:47,370
How's it going?

218
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,500
Good. How are you doing?

219
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:52,080
Good. Getting down on some popsicles.

220
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:56,020
Maybe she's come in a
couple times stoned, but like...

221
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:58,460
Whatever. Who gives a
shit? It's not his business.

222
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:01,360
And it's not, like, getting
in the way of anything.

223
00:30:01,370 --> 00:30:05,090
And then she took off all her shit, threw it in
the sink, and left and just didn't come back.

224
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:06,770
And no one's heard from her.

225
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:14,269
Yeah, so, it was kind of funny... But, like, at the same
time really awkward and uncomfortable for everyone.

226
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:19,060
And yeah, I'm just getting overwhelmed
about not accomplishing anything...

227
00:30:37,930 --> 00:30:39,170
You're doing that fuckin' look.

228
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:41,460
What look.

229
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:53,730
How's your bro, bro?

230
00:30:55,610 --> 00:30:57,010
I have no idea.

231
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:00,790
You don't talk to him?

232
00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:04,460
No. He's an asshole.

233
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:08,020
You know, you're an asshole too.

234
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:18,840
Are you fucking anyone?

235
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,021
No.

236
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:22,960
Are you?

237
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,550
Yes. I'm fucking Liv?

238
00:31:30,904 --> 00:31:31,904
Okay.

239
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:36,290
Why you gotta ask that?
You can't handle that shit.

240
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:39,500
Why can I not handle that?

241
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:41,070
I like Liv.

242
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:45,380
You always judge me
based on the past. And...

243
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:49,830
I'm not sixteen anymore. I'm not gonna freak
out just because you have a girlfriend.

244
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,200
The fuck are you talking about...

245
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,740
People change, Tom.

246
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:02,290
Let's not get into that.

247
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:05,630
But... I'm spinning tonight.

248
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:10,680
Oh, you're spinning?
Is that what you call it?

249
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:11,750
Oh my god...

250
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,590
Who the fuck are you?

251
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:15,380
Yo, did you see this?

252
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,320
Oh my god.

253
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:24,470
Fuck off.

254
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:38,420
Find me something, come on.

255
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:42,270
Ja?

256
00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:44,930
Ja.

257
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:46,260
Ja?

258
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:47,450
Ja.

259
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:48,170
Ja.

260
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:49,180
Ja.

261
00:32:53,090 --> 00:32:54,450
I'm having a panic attack.

262
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:56,470
What about some pants?

263
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:58,660
Yeah.

264
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:05,600
Ja?

265
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:07,580
Ja.

266
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:09,570
Can you see your face in these?

267
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:21,460
Enjoy your day.

268
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:23,470
You too, Lee.

269
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:28,820
What.

270
00:33:29,010 --> 00:33:30,010
Nothing.

271
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:53,370
I guess I knew when I
left that I would miss a lot.

272
00:33:53,710 --> 00:33:56,750
And that people would be different.

273
00:33:56,790 --> 00:33:58,170
But I guess that...

274
00:34:01,170 --> 00:34:05,160
Actually coming back and
seeing things change is...

275
00:34:07,050 --> 00:34:09,640
I don't know. It's kind of jarring.

276
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:17,570
People are doing different things and...

277
00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:22,840
Meeting new people and...

278
00:34:26,970 --> 00:34:32,080
I don't know. I guess it makes
me realize how insignificant I am.

279
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:40,100
Which makes sense because I wasn't really
ever friends with anybody in the first place.

280
00:34:40,890 --> 00:34:42,040
That's not true.

281
00:34:42,610 --> 00:34:43,640
No, it is.

282
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:48,060
I'm disconnected. I've
always been like that.

283
00:34:55,890 --> 00:35:01,290
But I think... I think I'm just
jealous that you're happy.

284
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:04,350
Or seem to be happy.

285
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:08,070
I feel like I should be.

286
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:15,370
I left New York on my
own terms to do what I love.

287
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:23,080
And do the thing that I feel most connected to and that
I can lose myself in and that makes me feel something.

288
00:35:25,470 --> 00:35:31,600
But I feel like I've been stuck doing this
version of it that makes me feel nothing.

289
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:41,660
And I don't even know why I'm
still there, or what I'm really doing.

290
00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:46,110
It makes me feel like a fraud.

291
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:54,530
I guess I just don't feel
connected to anything right now.

292
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:57,740
Um...

293
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:01,140
Do you want me to say
something encouraging?

294
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:07,240
No, you don't need to say anything.

295
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:08,760
Good.

296
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:09,830
Sorry.

297
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,080
Alright, it's cool.

298
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,970
I gotta finds me something sexy.

299
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:49,590
And I put it out there, and
yeah... That's why I'm awesome.

300
00:36:52,490 --> 00:36:53,490
But no.

301
00:36:54,710 --> 00:37:00,259
I think it's funny when an
artist will be doing an interview...

302
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:05,530
And he likes to talk
about his poetic process.

303
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,120
And he's like...

304
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:16,040
He'll say some bullshit like, "Ah, yeah, I need to
be in my Williamsburg loft pad listening to Bach..."

305
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:23,336
"Sipping on some chai tea after a
long, hard bike ride on my fixed gear..."

306
00:37:24,205 --> 00:37:26,420
"With the bike seat that's
kinda shaped like a cock."

307
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:31,240
"Yeah, it really gets
my artistic flow going."

308
00:37:33,170 --> 00:37:36,800
Nah, man. Fuck you!
You're all full of shit.

309
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:40,970
There's a formula. No one writes
their own shit anymore. Fuck you.

310
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,460
All the good artists are hidden anyway.

311
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:47,820
They just write for the people that have the
fattest asses and most followers on Instagram.

312
00:37:50,730 --> 00:37:53,330
Yeah. Whatever. Doesn't matter though.

313
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:58,230
As long as people come to my
show, and they like my music...

314
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,740
And they drink drinks...

315
00:38:00,848 --> 00:38:03,460
And I get laid afterwards.

316
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,549
That's fucking awesome.

317
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:10,670
If you don't like my music, fuck you. I don't give
a shit. I'm not original. I'm not gonna judge you.

318
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:16,910
Alright. Well, first of all, the way I get like
half the people to come to my shows anyway...

319
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:23,290
I never told anyone this. Alright, so
on Tinder I just swipe 'yes' to everyone.

320
00:38:23,610 --> 00:38:27,990
And... And, like... I'm mainly matched
with uggos because all uggos, you know...

321
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:34,920
Alright, whatever... So I fuckin'... I
swipe on the uggos and then I'm like...

322
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:38,710
Yo, you should come to my show.
It would be really cool if you came...

323
00:42:51,650 --> 00:42:53,490
Your hair totally smells like strawberries.

324
00:43:00,670 --> 00:43:01,670
No, it doesn't.

325
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:08,850
You know, like, how I was saying before.

326
00:43:09,930 --> 00:43:15,080
You know, how, like, this whole scene
is so, like, trivial with, like whole...

327
00:43:15,630 --> 00:43:17,710
I don't know... With the
music, and the drugs, and...

328
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:21,960
All I need is music. That's it.

329
00:43:24,250 --> 00:43:26,210
And maybe a little bit of hard alcohol.

330
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:33,840
So how about you Cecilia?

331
00:43:35,790 --> 00:43:36,790
What's going on with you?

332
00:43:38,350 --> 00:43:39,870
What's going on in that head of yours?

333
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:44,420
Nothing.

334
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:49,130
Nothing? Come on,
really, nothing is going on?

335
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:55,000
You're just... you're SO wound up!

336
00:43:55,750 --> 00:44:01,290
Like, I just wanna SHAKE YOU... I
just wanna, like, get you out of your skin.

337
00:44:03,270 --> 00:44:04,270
Let's do this.

338
00:44:06,630 --> 00:44:09,170
I don't give sex. Only blowjobs.

339
00:44:13,170 --> 00:44:13,780
Let's go!

340
00:44:14,090 --> 00:44:15,090
Come on, suck it.

341
00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:38,130
Dave, this is Cecilia... Cecilia, Dave...

342
00:44:38,330 --> 00:44:43,290
Dave is the best fucking promoter in New York
City... And this is his super hot girlfriend!

343
00:44:43,750 --> 00:44:45,960
You know what I'm gonna
do when I win all your money?

344
00:44:46,210 --> 00:44:47,330
I'm gonna buy your mom.

345
00:44:56,750 --> 00:44:58,960
Buying your mom! Buying your mom!

346
00:44:59,170 --> 00:45:01,606
Your mom... Let's just go straight
to your mom's house, alright?

347
00:45:01,630 --> 00:45:03,000
Take me there, take me there.

348
00:45:03,210 --> 00:45:06,630
It is a Tommy kind of day.

349
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:11,070
Want to do one for fun?

350
00:46:25,710 --> 00:46:26,710
Hey.

351
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:27,940
Hi.

352
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:29,220
You mind?

353
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:34,400
I've been looking for you all over...

354
00:46:37,530 --> 00:46:38,530
You have?

355
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:39,760
Uh-huh.

356
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:47,230
Don't be a dick, Cecilia.
Cut this autistic girl shit.

357
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:52,540
I wanna go.

358
00:47:00,450 --> 00:47:01,640
I wanna go!

359
00:47:02,850 --> 00:47:03,850
Now?!

360
00:47:06,390 --> 00:47:07,540
You're a fucked up person.

361
00:47:16,710 --> 00:47:18,170
Can I finish my beer at least?

362
00:47:21,950 --> 00:47:25,810
Alright, motherfuckers.
One last sip for the road.

363
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:28,290
That's what I like about you, Dave.

364
00:47:29,010 --> 00:47:30,170
You always know how to share.

365
00:47:38,290 --> 00:47:39,590
Omar is arriving now.

366
00:47:41,270 --> 00:47:42,270
Who's Omar?

367
00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:45,450
Fuckin' Uber driver.

368
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:50,520
Get up.

369
00:47:52,230 --> 00:47:53,230
Get up.

370
00:47:55,220 --> 00:47:56,220
Get up!

371
00:47:58,310 --> 00:47:59,310
Get up!

372
00:48:38,910 --> 00:48:40,900
I think there are ghosts in here.

373
00:48:41,090 --> 00:48:42,090
What?

374
00:48:43,990 --> 00:48:46,170
I think there are ghosts in here.

375
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:47,360
Shut up, come on.

376
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:49,340
Let's go, let's go.

377
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:20,750
What.

378
00:50:25,070 --> 00:50:26,070
What.

379
00:50:34,290 --> 00:50:35,290
It's pretty.

380
00:50:38,420 --> 00:50:39,440
Wait... Wait for it.

381
00:50:49,930 --> 00:50:51,790
I bet all your songs are about me.

382
00:50:59,260 --> 00:51:00,260
I got an idea.

383
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:17,700
Come here.

384
00:51:21,130 --> 00:51:22,130
Come here!

385
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:02,380
I'm really not tired at all.

386
00:54:14,180 --> 00:54:15,480
What are you doing tomorrow?

387
00:54:17,350 --> 00:54:18,350
Nothing.

388
00:54:34,290 --> 00:54:35,300
Do you miss me?

389
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:37,640
Mm-hm.

390
00:54:47,370 --> 00:54:48,640
Do you think about me?

391
00:54:51,190 --> 00:54:52,190
Uh-huh.

392
00:55:09,770 --> 00:55:10,900
Do you love me?

393
00:55:18,130 --> 00:55:19,130
Tom...

394
00:55:32,850 --> 00:55:34,960
I know you didn't fall asleep that fast.

395
00:55:44,210 --> 00:55:45,210
No.

396
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:53,120
Fuck off.

397
00:56:15,411 --> 00:56:17,317
That's probably a good idea...

398
00:56:37,940 --> 00:56:38,940
Wake up.

399
00:56:40,540 --> 00:56:41,540
Hm?

400
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:44,890
Wake up, get the fuck out.

401
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:47,500
What?

402
00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:51,360
Get the fuck up.

403
00:56:54,290 --> 00:56:55,290
What?

404
00:56:56,350 --> 00:56:57,460
You piece of shit.

405
00:56:58,350 --> 00:56:59,960
Get the fuck out of my apartment.

406
00:57:21,550 --> 00:57:22,880
Is it coming to you now?

407
00:57:27,890 --> 00:57:29,520
Don't act like a fucking child.

408
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:35,090
Get the fuck out of my apartment.

409
00:57:55,070 --> 00:58:00,530
You're the same fucking person you
were in high school, and you don't change!

410
00:58:02,210 --> 00:58:03,790
So get the fuck out!

411
00:59:01,330 --> 00:59:02,330
Come on, get out of here.

412
00:59:09,980 --> 00:59:10,980
Come on, come on.

413
00:59:16,580 --> 00:59:17,580
Cecilia.

414
01:00:00,330 --> 01:00:01,960
You just show up out of the blue?

415
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:06,500
And fuck with some guy that you used to know...
Is that not completely fucking psycho to you?!

416
01:00:07,870 --> 01:00:10,260
I don't know what the
fuck is going on right now.

417
01:00:13,740 --> 01:00:14,900
God, you're fucking pathetic.

418
01:00:17,290 --> 01:00:18,290
Fuck you.

419
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:20,240
No.

420
01:00:20,460 --> 01:00:21,460
No.

421
01:00:22,380 --> 01:00:25,290
You're fucking out of
your mind. Don't touch me.

422
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:27,440
And I'm not done talking to you.

423
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:29,660
I'm not interested.

424
01:00:33,460 --> 01:00:36,170
Cecilia, just STOP IT.

425
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:42,550
Stop being a psycho and talk to me like a HUMAN
BEING... because I'm trying to help you.

426
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:48,621
You fucking don't know me
and I have nothing to say to you.

427
01:00:48,994 --> 01:00:49,994
Okay?

428
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:54,460
Don't touch me.

429
01:00:55,700 --> 01:00:56,700
Then leave.

430
01:00:58,190 --> 01:01:00,420
I said don't fucking touch me!

431
01:01:00,910 --> 01:01:02,030
Go, come on, go.

432
01:01:04,590 --> 01:01:05,590
Fine.

433
01:01:32,440 --> 01:01:33,680
Tony.

434
01:01:34,980 --> 01:01:36,530
It's your sister.

435
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:03,280
My mouth tastes like puke.

436
01:04:07,350 --> 01:04:08,430
The fuck are you doing?

437
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:40,730
What's that smell?

438
01:04:42,624 --> 01:04:43,624
It's ME.

439
01:05:16,050 --> 01:05:18,020
Take the whole fucking bed, why don't you.

440
01:05:51,882 --> 01:05:55,330
You're going to take a number, sign
in, remember your number as well.

441
01:05:55,510 --> 01:05:56,560
Please don't lose it.

442
01:05:56,730 --> 01:06:00,916
Keep your things to one side... We're going to be looking
at technique, we're going to be looking at type...

443
01:06:00,940 --> 01:06:03,150
Don't waste our time, we're
not going to waste yours.

444
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:42,160
Good.

445
01:06:59,940 --> 01:07:02,409
Looking good, ladies,
looking good. Alright.

446
01:07:02,410 --> 01:07:03,410
Any questions?

447
01:07:03,890 --> 01:07:04,420
Yeah.

448
01:07:04,500 --> 01:07:06,000
What count do we switch the bevel on?

449
01:07:06,130 --> 01:07:06,780
On four.

450
01:07:06,784 --> 01:07:06,977
Great.

451
01:07:07,180 --> 01:07:08,362
Yeah, good. Anything else?

452
01:07:08,936 --> 01:07:10,460
Let's do it again, then
we're going to go in groups.

453
01:07:10,470 --> 01:07:11,290
Looks great everyone.

454
01:07:11,310 --> 01:07:13,170
Keep it up, here we go. Thank you.

455
01:07:16,870 --> 01:07:17,870
This is one...

456
01:07:18,840 --> 01:07:20,960
Five, six, seven, eight and hit it...

457
01:07:31,560 --> 01:07:33,020
Eyes never left me.

458
01:07:35,740 --> 01:07:37,833
No, don't be annoyed. You were SO fierce.

459
01:07:38,330 --> 01:07:39,800
He was looking at you too.

460
01:07:40,110 --> 01:07:41,280
Not as much as you though.

461
01:07:41,678 --> 01:07:42,980
I mean with that wrist...

462
01:07:44,390 --> 01:07:45,390
Pretty fierce, right?

463
01:07:49,120 --> 01:07:51,156
It was one of your best
auditions I think I've seen.

464
01:07:51,180 --> 01:07:52,640
Oh my god. Really?

465
01:07:52,670 --> 01:07:53,670
Absolutely.

466
01:07:54,060 --> 01:07:55,060
So sweet.

467
01:08:06,740 --> 01:08:08,160
Is Cecilia Romero in here?

468
01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:23,520
You alright?

469
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:25,800
In here.

470
01:08:36,547 --> 01:08:37,300
Nice work, ladies.

471
01:08:37,526 --> 01:08:42,580
Very good, very good. Okay, can we
see Sarah, Jessica, Cecilia and Kristen?

472
01:08:42,590 --> 01:08:43,930
That's the next group, please.

473
01:08:44,770 --> 01:08:47,410
Alright, thank you, group
two. Let's take it from the top?

474
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:49,000
Thank you.

475
01:08:52,160 --> 01:08:53,160
One.

476
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:19,160
Just keep going. Please keep dancing.

477
01:09:24,180 --> 01:09:26,986
- Great.
- Okay, that was amazing, great, thanks, good work.

478
01:09:29,260 --> 01:09:31,020
Everyone hold tight
for a few minutes, yeah?

479
01:09:31,680 --> 01:09:32,680
Thank you.

480
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:50,740
Alright, thank you everyone. We're gonna be
having you do another combination shortly.

481
01:09:51,220 --> 01:09:54,649
But just take a few minutes, get your breath, get
your mind right, and we'll start learning it.

482
01:09:54,650 --> 01:09:57,360
We'll make a cut before then
but just give us a few minutes.

483
01:09:57,650 --> 01:09:58,650
Thank you so much.

484
01:09:58,780 --> 01:10:01,230
Thank you, thank you,
ladies. Great, great work.

485
01:10:03,340 --> 01:10:04,540
Thanks for all your hard work.

486
01:10:05,180 --> 01:10:07,900
Make sure you have your personal
belongings with you when you leave.

487
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:43,030
Get the fuck out of my
house. Come on, dogs.

488
01:10:43,270 --> 01:10:44,110
Come on, man.

489
01:10:44,220 --> 01:10:45,439
You never wanna do shit.

490
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:47,850
Here, come on, we're gonna
do shots... We're gonna do shots.

491
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:52,840
Hey!

492
01:10:53,290 --> 01:10:54,290
Hey!

493
01:10:54,530 --> 01:10:55,530
Hey!

494
01:10:55,850 --> 01:10:57,879
Shots off of me, shots off of me.

495
01:10:57,880 --> 01:11:00,100
Come on, yeah, I'm serious, jackass!

496
01:11:00,150 --> 01:11:03,223
My fuckin' sister just
walked in the fuckin' door.

497
01:11:03,248 --> 01:11:04,848
You take too many damn hits of the weed!

498
01:11:11,130 --> 01:11:12,130
Aw.

499
01:11:15,050 --> 01:11:16,050
How you doin'?

500
01:11:20,090 --> 01:11:22,620
Fuckin' Christ, you're so fuckin' boring.

501
01:11:27,300 --> 01:11:28,530
Why are you so contorted?

502
01:11:31,730 --> 01:11:33,260
Why do you look so fucked up?

503
01:11:38,040 --> 01:11:39,040
How you doin'?

504
01:11:40,180 --> 01:11:41,180
You okay?

505
01:11:41,890 --> 01:11:44,000
Got some kinda fuckin'
problem goin' on in there?

506
01:11:46,850 --> 01:11:50,800
Got some fuckin' inflamed,
burning sensation?

507
01:11:52,073 --> 01:11:53,130
Some kind of infection?

508
01:12:00,770 --> 01:12:02,130
My fuckin' baby sister...

509
01:12:04,490 --> 01:12:07,520
The most beautiful
fuckin' girl on the block.

510
01:12:12,710 --> 01:12:14,830
Well, it's good to see you
and I'm glad you're alive.

511
01:12:16,730 --> 01:12:17,930
But you can't stay here.

512
01:12:19,090 --> 01:12:24,610
Because, uh, you know, other
people have their own fuckin' struggle.

513
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:28,600
So.

514
01:12:30,490 --> 01:12:31,490
You know.

515
01:12:31,810 --> 01:12:33,280
Hit the bricks soon.

516
01:12:35,580 --> 01:12:40,350
But I love you and, uh, I
know you're gonna be alright.

517
01:12:44,100 --> 01:12:45,360
Because you're fuckin' hot.

518
01:12:46,270 --> 01:12:49,282
And I know you were, like, watching kinda
with your eyes where I put that shit...

519
01:12:49,306 --> 01:12:53,728
If you touch my fuckin' weed, I swear to god
I'm gonna fuckin' come back into this room

520
01:12:54,641 --> 01:12:55,801
and I'm gonna fuckin' like...

521
01:12:56,720 --> 01:12:58,280
THROW YOU AROUND.
