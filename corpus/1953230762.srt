1
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:14,050
Yeah, Walter. Hi, it's George.

2
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:16,886
I know it's my third call on a Saturday,

3
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:20,973
but I'm having a bit of a problem
with the Lockwise Helping Hand account.

4
00:02:21,058 --> 00:02:24,268
Now, I know it's your baby,
and I know you'll straighten it out,

5
00:02:24,353 --> 00:02:28,648
but, well, I'm thinking of heading into
the office today to see if I can sort it out.

6
00:02:28,732 --> 00:02:31,984
So, no problems. We'll see you on Monday.

7
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:35,947
Don't worry about it.
Give my Iove to Rebecca. Bye-bye.

8
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:40,284
- Barbara, stop it.
- No.

9
00:02:40,369 --> 00:02:42,537
- You need this.
- No, I will not.

10
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:43,996
George!

11
00:02:44,081 --> 00:02:45,915
George, yes. Where is George?

12
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:48,042
- I would Iike to speak to him.
- I don't know.

13
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:50,586
I don't even know who you are, young Iady.

14
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:53,214
- George.
- Thank God.

15
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:55,716
George, who is this young Iady?

16
00:02:56,385 --> 00:02:58,094
- Here, honey.
- That's...

17
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:59,971
I can't do this.

18
00:03:00,055 --> 00:03:01,597
That's my wife, Mom.

19
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:04,475
No. She's too young.

20
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:06,269
How old is she?

21
00:03:06,395 --> 00:03:08,020
We were married nine years ago, remember?

22
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:09,730
She's nine years old?

23
00:03:09,815 --> 00:03:13,317
Our marriage is nine years old,
our marriage.

24
00:03:17,281 --> 00:03:19,740
She's the second one.

25
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:23,536
No. I adored the other one.

26
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:26,414
I know, Mom, but,
you know, she tried to kill me.

27
00:03:26,498 --> 00:03:28,958
No, she didn't.
That was just a Iittle hit-and-run.

28
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:31,752
Yeah, well, I was in traction for two months.

29
00:03:31,837 --> 00:03:33,754
I don't remember that.

30
00:03:35,257 --> 00:03:37,633
- Here you go.
- I Iike this one.

31
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:40,595
- Well, that's the most popular one.
- Yeah.

32
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:42,471
There you go.

33
00:03:46,685 --> 00:03:49,478
- We aren't done with this.
- Yes, I know. I know.

34
00:03:49,605 --> 00:03:52,231
And why are you wearing a shirt and tie
on a Saturday?

35
00:03:52,316 --> 00:03:54,108
I have to go into the office.

36
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:56,277
- You're going into the office?
- Yes.

37
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:58,029
- When?
- Now.

38
00:03:58,113 --> 00:04:01,115
George, aren't you forgetting something?

39
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,118
No, I'm not.

40
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,454
I Iove you.

41
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:09,624
Nice try. Your son.

42
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:13,252
You promised him you would take him
to his baseball game today.

43
00:04:13,337 --> 00:04:16,339
I'm not telling him this time. You do it.

44
00:04:16,465 --> 00:04:21,010
Honey, I'll be back in time.
The game doesn't start until 2:00.

45
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:22,136
1 :00.

46
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:24,430
I'll be back.

47
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:27,808
Mom, Dad, Grandma isn't eating.

48
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:32,480
God, I hate old people.

49
00:04:32,481 --> 00:04:34,315
Watch your mouth, young Iady.

50
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:37,276
Why? It's not Iike she understands
anything we're saying.

51
00:04:37,361 --> 00:04:40,029
You know what? I've had
just about enough of your attitude.

52
00:04:41,156 --> 00:04:43,199
Hello? You Iistening?

53
00:04:43,492 --> 00:04:47,161
iPod. They were made
to ignore the stepmother.

54
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,245
George?

55
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:51,332
Honey, would you take those things off,
please, and Iisten to your mother?

56
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,669
Okay, she is not my mother.

57
00:04:55,212 --> 00:04:57,004
She's the mother of that thing.

58
00:04:57,172 --> 00:04:58,881
- You're the thing.
- You're a thing.

59
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,634
- You're a thing, sister.
- Don't call me that.

60
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:05,680
Dad, I'm really excited
about the game today.

61
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:08,140
It's gonna be so cool having you there.

62
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:12,853
Jeremy's dad is always there,
but he yells at me if I miss the ball.

63
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:14,980
Well, that's not gonna happen today, son.

64
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:16,691
Now, I've got to run to the office,

65
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:19,360
but I'll be back in time
to take you to your game.

66
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:20,778
You promise?

67
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:23,698
Scout's honor.

68
00:05:28,787 --> 00:05:29,787
Don't forget. I:00.

69
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:30,955
He's not coming.

70
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:34,208
That was the Star Trek sign.

71
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:35,876
He's a Trekkie.

72
00:05:36,378 --> 00:05:37,878
And so am I.

73
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:07,742
- Morning, Jackie.
- Hello.

74
00:06:07,826 --> 00:06:10,244
Don't you wish it was this quiet every day?

75
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:12,538
Be careful what you wish for.

76
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:28,888
Gotta be mine

77
00:06:33,018 --> 00:06:35,561
Gotta be strong

78
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:38,731
A Iittle while

79
00:06:38,857 --> 00:06:42,526
And you got nothing to be guilty of

80
00:06:42,611 --> 00:06:44,528
You might not wanna sing that song.

81
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:55,039
Okay. Shred everything.

82
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:57,333
My shredder's broken.
I need another shredder!

83
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:58,793
- Here we go!
- Who's got one?

84
00:06:58,877 --> 00:07:00,127
Don't Ieave any evidence. Nothing. Okay?

85
00:07:00,212 --> 00:07:01,879
- Put 'em in a box!
- Let me through. Let me through.

86
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:04,799
Shred everything! Here, here. Right here!

87
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:09,929
AII the boxes!

88
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:14,433
AII right. Grab those two!
What are you doing?

89
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:17,436
Just get it in here! Anything!

90
00:07:20,232 --> 00:07:21,649
I got one more!

91
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:23,567
- Is it the Iast quarter?
- Yeah.

92
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:26,987
Dump everything!

93
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:30,157
George, come in here, buddy.

94
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:32,952
Come in, come in, come in.

95
00:07:33,078 --> 00:07:34,829
Walter, what's going on?

96
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:36,831
Hey, Iisten, pull your money out of the bank,

97
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:39,583
cash in all your stocks and bonds
by 10:00 a.m. Monday morning.

98
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:41,126
Why?

99
00:07:41,545 --> 00:07:44,713
Well, CNN is doing
one of those investigative reports

100
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:46,507
about Lockwise Industries.

101
00:07:48,343 --> 00:07:50,845
That's fantastic.
That'll be great for business.

102
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:54,807
Not really. They're gonna say we've been
running a Ponzi scheme for seven years.

103
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:59,520
Well, they can't say that, Walter.
That's Iibelous.

104
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:03,357
I mean, this firm's been operating
successfully for over 100 years.

105
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:07,152
Yeah, yeah, they're focusing
on the charity division, Helping Hands.

106
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:10,281
Helping Hands has been going strong
for over eight years.

107
00:08:10,365 --> 00:08:11,699
I should know. I'm CFO.

108
00:08:12,868 --> 00:08:14,034
Yeah. Yeah, you are.

109
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:16,412
Could you say that again,
the part about the CFO?

110
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:19,540
I'm CFO. I should know.

111
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:21,834
Right. Perfect, perfect. Thanks.

112
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:26,672
Walter, are they reporting
that it's our division?

113
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:28,507
Yeah. Your division.

114
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:30,509
But I have all the records.

115
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:32,928
Say that again.

116
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:35,973
But I have all the records.

117
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:38,017
Perfect. Now shred them.

118
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:39,894
- Walter.
- Yeah.

119
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:41,937
What are you saying?

120
00:08:42,314 --> 00:08:43,981
I'm saying that all the monies

121
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:48,903
that came into Lockwise Industries'
Helping Hands charity investment group

122
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:51,196
are part of a big, old Ponzi scheme.

123
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:53,324
What?

124
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:55,284
Yeah. Christ.

125
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:57,828
It worked for a while.

126
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:00,789
I almost feel bad for hanging
you out to dry Iike this.

127
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:03,584
You should see your face, dude.

128
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:07,463
And by the way,
this is not gonna be pretty for you.

129
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,548
I feel awful.

130
00:09:09,633 --> 00:09:10,883
Horrible.

131
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:12,509
What? But...

132
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:14,261
For me?

133
00:09:14,346 --> 00:09:16,597
You were a Iowly accountant, remember?

134
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:20,476
And then I pull you out of bookkeeping
and make you the CFO.

135
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,687
I mean, you had no experience
whatsoever. None. None at all.

136
00:09:23,772 --> 00:09:27,483
I had worked here five years
prior to that, Walter.

137
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:32,488
- I was working hard. I thought I earned it.
- You did work hard.

138
00:09:32,614 --> 00:09:36,408
Nobody earns it around here.
I had to bang my way to the top.

139
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:39,036
And there's a Iot of big women
on the Board of Directors here.

140
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,164
And that was hard,
and it was hard to stay hard.

141
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,875
So don't talk to me about "hard."

142
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:50,047
Okay? You were paid a seven-figure salary
for exactly this reason.

143
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,924
What reason?

144
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:56,971
So you could take the fall.
Man, you've been paid to be screwed.

145
00:09:57,055 --> 00:09:59,264
Kind ofjealous. Oh, well.

146
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:03,268
Walter, I knew nothing about this.

147
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:05,729
Yeah, I know. I know. Sorry.

148
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:08,524
Would have ruined it if you had, kind of.

149
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:14,071
Well, that explains why I couldn't get
those accounts to balance.

150
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:15,739
Now you're thinking.

151
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:19,994
What about the charities?
Walter, 82 charities.

152
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,704
They think their monies are safe.

153
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:23,914
I'm handing you over to the Feds,

154
00:10:24,082 --> 00:10:27,835
and all you care about
is the stupid charities?

155
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:30,671
By the way, there's only 12 charities.

156
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:33,966
There's 82 charities.

157
00:10:34,426 --> 00:10:38,595
No, there's 12. The other 70 companies
were set up by the Malone family.

158
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:41,098
Awkward.

159
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:44,768
The Mafia Malones?

160
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:47,271
You've been Iaundering money, dude.

161
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:50,107
Yeah, this is gonna be really awful for you.

162
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:53,193
Hey, man, be careful
when you start your car.

163
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:58,532
This is not happening.

164
00:10:59,034 --> 00:11:02,536
A Ponzi scheme? A Ponzi scheme?

165
00:11:03,455 --> 00:11:07,374
Walter, where are the investors' monies?

166
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:12,254
Walter? Walter!

167
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:25,726
Okay, calm down. Calm, calm, calm.
Calm down.

168
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,686
That's it. That's it.

169
00:11:27,771 --> 00:11:30,564
Just calm down.

170
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:34,943
I'm not calming. I'm not calming.
I'm not calming.

171
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:52,669
- Hey, boss, just the person I wanna see.
- What do you have?

172
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:55,339
So I've been Iooking
into the Malone crime family, right?

173
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:56,423
And the more I Iook at them,

174
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:58,175
I'm finding that they're connected
to this company

175
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:00,677
that does a Iot of charity
investment work, called Lockwise.

176
00:12:00,762 --> 00:12:01,762
Yes?

177
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:03,764
I think they may be
Iaundering money through them.

178
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:06,266
- We've been after these guys for years.
- Yeah.

179
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:08,435
Why don't you see
what you can find out, okay?

180
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,853
Okay.

181
00:12:09,938 --> 00:12:11,438
Thanks a Iot.

182
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:14,668
George?

183
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:21,258
I've been calling you for hours.

184
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,012
Yeah, I know. I know.

185
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,722
How is he?

186
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:30,350
- He was upset, but he'll be fine.
- That's good.

187
00:13:30,602 --> 00:13:32,269
Is it true?

188
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:34,271
What?

189
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:37,191
Come on, George.
Don't play games with me.

190
00:13:37,275 --> 00:13:39,943
AII the wives were talking about it
at the field today.

191
00:13:41,696 --> 00:13:42,863
Honey,

192
00:13:43,281 --> 00:13:47,326
I swear I had no idea this was going on.

193
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:48,410
Okay? None.

194
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:51,496
I walked into the office,
and there's Walter, and he's saying,

195
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:54,374
"Why don't you shred stuff?
Shred whatever you have.

196
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:56,668
"Shred what's in your desk.
Just shred everything."

197
00:13:56,753 --> 00:13:58,378
And I'm going, "What's going on?"

198
00:13:58,463 --> 00:14:00,380
And he's saying,
"You're gonna take the fall for this,

199
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:04,509
"because it's a Ponzi scheme.
It's a Ponzi scheme, and you're the one.

200
00:14:04,594 --> 00:14:07,012
"You're going down,
'cause you're the CFO."

201
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:12,059
You know? I mean, they gave
Bernie Madoff 200 years, honey.

202
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:15,229
What do you think they're gonna do to me?
What do you think they're gonna do?

203
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:18,190
And what's gonna happen with the kids?
What's gonna happen?

204
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:20,734
Howie's afraid, you know,
"Dad, you missed a game."

205
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:23,111
I'm gonna miss 38 seasons.

206
00:14:23,238 --> 00:14:25,614
Sweetheart, I'm in trouble.

207
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:29,910
- Calm down.
- Okay.

208
00:14:32,247 --> 00:14:34,248
- We need to get a Iawyer.
- A Iawyer.

209
00:14:34,332 --> 00:14:36,625
And then you need to go to your mom's

210
00:14:36,751 --> 00:14:38,460
and go find your mom's Valium.

211
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:40,504
Get a Valium out of my mom's purse.

212
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:42,881
- Okay. Can you do that? Like right now.
- Okay.

213
00:14:42,966 --> 00:14:44,591
And you need to calm down.

214
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:46,885
- Honey.
- It's gonna be okay.

215
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:48,470
- It will be. It will be.
- Yes.

216
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:51,765
You know, minimum security.
It's not that bad.

217
00:14:52,976 --> 00:14:54,184
Hey, Madea.

218
00:14:54,644 --> 00:14:57,938
Hey, Lorraine, how you doing?
Good to see you.

219
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:05,279
Lord, it's a zoo up in there
on the first of the month.

220
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:16,790
Excuse me, ma'am. You wanna take this?
I don't feel Iike taking it back.

221
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:19,251
Thank you so much.
It's crazy up in there. Be careful.

222
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:21,461
They ain't taking that EBT card.
They stopped taking that.

223
00:15:21,546 --> 00:15:23,547
I got to go somewhere else that take that.

224
00:15:24,007 --> 00:15:27,134
Yeah, I got to go burn up my EBT card.

225
00:15:33,975 --> 00:15:40,939
Give me your money.

226
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:44,526
That's a cute Iittle gun you got, boy.
Get out this car.

227
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:49,906
Lady, I will stab and shoot you.
Give me your money.

228
00:15:49,991 --> 00:15:52,159
Son, I'm gonna tell you this one time, okay?

229
00:15:52,243 --> 00:15:54,786
I want you to get out of this car
and go on about your business.

230
00:15:54,871 --> 00:15:56,204
Go get you a job.

231
00:15:56,331 --> 00:15:58,999
You ain't supposed to be stealing
from nobody working as hard as I...

232
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:01,251
What the hell you got to come over here
and steal from the poor for?

233
00:16:01,336 --> 00:16:04,129
Get out the car. This is your warning, son.
Get out the car. Now, go on.

234
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:05,881
Then give me your money!

235
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:09,217
I worked for years to get my Social Security.
Now, I finally got it.

236
00:16:09,344 --> 00:16:10,427
I ain't on no fixed income.

237
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:12,220
I'm on a broke income,
'cause I'm broke as hell.

238
00:16:12,347 --> 00:16:13,805
Now, I want you
to get the hell out of this car.

239
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:17,392
This is your chance. Get out of the car, son.
Go on, now. Go get you a job.

240
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:19,895
I'm gonna ask you one more time,
old woman.

241
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:21,355
I'm gonna tell you one more time.

242
00:16:21,439 --> 00:16:26,026
Look here! Get out of this car.
Go find you a job. Do you understand me?

243
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:28,779
They got people all over the world
that is working hard,

244
00:16:28,863 --> 00:16:31,281
and y'all young thugs gonna come
try to take money from somebody.

245
00:16:31,366 --> 00:16:33,116
That makes me mad.
Now, you about to make me mad.

246
00:16:33,201 --> 00:16:35,202
You about to piss me off.
Now, get on out the car, son.

247
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:36,912
- I'm gonna count to three.
- Okay.

248
00:16:37,038 --> 00:16:41,792
One, two, three.

249
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:45,128
Four.

250
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:47,547
Five.

251
00:16:47,882 --> 00:16:51,343
I thought you was gonna count to three.
Son. Son, son, Iet me tell you something.

252
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:53,303
Get out the car
and go on about your business.

253
00:16:53,388 --> 00:16:56,765
Now, this is your Iast chance.
This is your Iast chance. Now I got to go.

254
00:16:56,891 --> 00:17:01,395
One more time. One, two...

255
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:02,729
Three!

256
00:17:08,903 --> 00:17:10,112
Let's go this way.

257
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:12,823
Put your seat belt on.
You need a car seat?

258
00:17:13,408 --> 00:17:14,783
Come get my money!

259
00:17:15,118 --> 00:17:17,619
Trying to take my damn money
that I worked this hard for.

260
00:17:19,414 --> 00:17:20,580
Lady!

261
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:22,290
I don't got insurance, Iady!

262
00:17:23,501 --> 00:17:24,793
Slow down! Slow down!

263
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:27,504
You're screaming
straight up Iike a Iittle biatch!

264
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:28,755
I want to go home!

265
00:17:32,093 --> 00:17:35,303
You want the money? You come get it.
I come get the money.

266
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:37,305
- I'm a real thug! I'm a real thug!
- You crazy!

267
00:17:37,432 --> 00:17:38,849
Oh, my God!

268
00:17:43,438 --> 00:17:44,479
Jake!

269
00:17:44,856 --> 00:17:47,107
I'm sorry. Take it.

270
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:51,736
Hey, what do you got?

271
00:17:51,821 --> 00:17:54,072
Well, just got off the phone with the SEC,

272
00:17:54,157 --> 00:17:58,368
and it seems that this Lockwise charity
is definitely a Ponzi scheme.

273
00:17:58,453 --> 00:18:00,162
COO, one Walter Burns.

274
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:02,789
CFO, George Needleman.
Never heard of him.

275
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:04,124
Let's arrest them both.

276
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,042
Well, it turns out
that Burns is on a private jet,

277
00:18:06,127 --> 00:18:09,337
according to the FAA, to Europe.
Took off five hours ago.

278
00:18:09,464 --> 00:18:12,674
So I'm sure he's gonna fight extradition.
But our boy, George, now...

279
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,801
Boy George? I Iove Boy George.

280
00:18:15,136 --> 00:18:18,305
Karma karma karma karma karma chameleon

281
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:22,517
You come and go
You come and go

282
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:23,643
Sir?

283
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:25,854
Sorry.

284
00:18:26,314 --> 00:18:29,483
George Needleman? Our guys should be
knocking at his door at any minute.

285
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:30,775
Great.

286
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:33,445
Well, it'd be great if we could get him
to testify against the Malones,

287
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:34,571
but that may be a tall order.

288
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:36,865
Okay, but no deal for him.

289
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:40,368
Look, I'm tired of these people
sticking it to the poor.

290
00:18:40,495 --> 00:18:41,661
Sir, if we don't offer him a deal,

291
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:45,040
what incentive does he have
to testify against the mob?

292
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:46,666
It's very simple, Brian.

293
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:49,836
If he testifies,
the Malones will probably kill him.

294
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:53,465
If he doesn't,
he goes to prison for the rest of his Iife.

295
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:55,175
It's a win-win.

296
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:58,345
Sir, I think we should consider...

297
00:18:58,471 --> 00:19:00,013
No, you don't. I want him fried.

298
00:19:00,348 --> 00:19:03,850
Now, get our agents there
before the Malone family gets to him.

299
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:07,812
Yes, sir.

300
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:11,191
Hi, it's George Needleman
calling for Jeffrey.

301
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:14,361
Yes, I'll hold.

302
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:18,031
Where are my car keys?

303
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,658
You don't drive anymore, Barbara.

304
00:19:19,742 --> 00:19:21,243
I know that.

305
00:19:21,911 --> 00:19:23,828
Dad, I wish you could have
been there today.

306
00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:25,956
Honey, your dad was very busy.

307
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,541
You suck.
You should probably just give it up.

308
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:29,751
No, I don't.

309
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:31,253
Yes, you do.

310
00:19:32,255 --> 00:19:33,421
And I just tweeted that.

311
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:35,340
- Dad!
- Howie, stop.

312
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:38,593
Your dad's on the phone. Eat your dinner.

313
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:40,345
Okay, thank you.

314
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:52,065
What'd he say?

315
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:57,195
Well, his secretary said
that he would recommend an attorney,

316
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,948
but that he didn't wanna represent me.

317
00:20:00,283 --> 00:20:02,867
After all those years of business with him?

318
00:20:02,952 --> 00:20:03,994
Yeah.

319
00:20:04,078 --> 00:20:05,203
What about Jeffrey?

320
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:09,082
Nobody's returning my calls.

321
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,585
Has anyone seen my car keys?

322
00:20:13,254 --> 00:20:15,255
Mom, you don't drive anymore.

323
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:18,008
Is it Hanukkah?

324
00:20:18,092 --> 00:20:19,509
No, it's not Hanukkah.

325
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:25,181
Yes, it is. That's why that nice young man
asked me to deliver this package to George.

326
00:20:26,017 --> 00:20:29,602
And it's a Iong drive,
and so I need my car keys.

327
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:32,689
Mom, who gave you this?

328
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:35,358
In the backyard,

329
00:20:35,443 --> 00:20:39,446
this man with a shiny, black suit
and black, shiny hair.

330
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:51,082
George, there's a note.

331
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:57,714
"You tock from me."

332
00:20:57,798 --> 00:20:59,299
"Take," honey. That says "take."

333
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:01,968
No, I think that's "tock," honey. T-O-C-K.

334
00:21:02,053 --> 00:21:03,386
Just read it.

335
00:21:03,471 --> 00:21:05,722
Well, the man obviously
needs a spelling Iesson,

336
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:07,057
not to mention his grammar.

337
00:21:07,141 --> 00:21:08,975
Can we open the present now?

338
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:11,144
Mom, you know what? Let's not open this.

339
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,312
No, this is ridiculous.

340
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:13,563
Oh, my God!

341
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:17,233
- It's a dead rat.
- I know.

342
00:21:17,318 --> 00:21:19,444
What does this mean?

343
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:22,447
AII rats die.

344
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:27,327
Oh, my God. George.

345
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:37,128
Don't move. Just stay here, okay?

346
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:39,756
Don't move.

347
00:21:41,175 --> 00:21:42,592
Stay here.

348
00:21:47,181 --> 00:21:48,264
George Needleman?

349
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:49,724
Yes.

350
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:52,018
FBI. You're under arrest.

351
00:21:52,103 --> 00:21:53,937
No!

352
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:00,652
I can't believe this.

353
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:04,989
You can't make bail.
Your accounts are frozen, George.

354
00:22:05,908 --> 00:22:08,326
Well, here's the thing.

355
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:13,498
I haven't done anything wrong.
I just wanna go home.

356
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:15,208
That's not gonna happen.

357
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:17,627
The Malone family
is trying to kill you, George.

358
00:22:18,129 --> 00:22:21,506
We've been given orders
to keep you protected.

359
00:22:22,133 --> 00:22:23,425
What does that mean?

360
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:25,552
It means you and your family
are coming with us.

361
00:22:29,807 --> 00:22:31,266
We have a problem with Needleman.

362
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,517
What happened?

363
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:33,643
I think Malone's boys know

364
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:35,687
that we're gonna offer him a chance
to testify against them,

365
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:36,855
so they sent their signature.

366
00:22:36,939 --> 00:22:38,064
Is he all right?

367
00:22:38,149 --> 00:22:39,816
Yeah, we're getting him out of there now.

368
00:22:40,109 --> 00:22:42,318
Good, I'll get on the phone
with the US Marshals right away...

369
00:22:42,403 --> 00:22:45,613
No, no. No, no. They can't go
into one of our regular safe houses.

370
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:48,366
The Malones have penetrated
our guys before.

371
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:52,704
You can't make bail.
Your accounts are frozen, George.

372
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:56,040
Well, here's the thing.

373
00:22:57,334 --> 00:23:01,212
I haven't done anything wrong.
I just wanna go home.

374
00:23:01,297 --> 00:23:02,922
That's not gonna happen.

375
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:05,341
The Malone family
is trying to kill you, George.

376
00:23:05,843 --> 00:23:09,220
We've been given orders
to keep you protected.

377
00:23:09,847 --> 00:23:11,139
What does that mean?

378
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:13,266
It means you and your family
are coming with us.

379
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:18,980
We have a problem with Needleman.

380
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:20,231
What happened?

381
00:23:20,316 --> 00:23:21,357
I think Malone's boys know

382
00:23:21,442 --> 00:23:23,401
that we're gonna offer him a chance
to testify against them,

383
00:23:23,486 --> 00:23:24,569
so they sent their signature.

384
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:25,778
Is he all right?

385
00:23:25,863 --> 00:23:27,530
Yeah, we're getting him out of there now.

386
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:30,033
Good, I'll get on the phone
with the US Marshals right away...

387
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:33,328
No, no. No, no. They can't go
into one of our regular safe houses.

388
00:23:34,038 --> 00:23:36,080
The Malones have penetrated
our guys before.

389
00:23:36,207 --> 00:23:38,249
- Now, get up.
- I'm up. I'm up.

390
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:41,586
Probably dreaming about Skittles
and Coca-Cola and Pepsi,

391
00:23:41,712 --> 00:23:44,047
diet soda and Mountain Dew
and Honey Buns,

392
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:46,007
and damn Krispy Kreme and everything else.

393
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:47,133
So you're up?

394
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:50,762
There you are, Sadie.
You must iron the sheets.

395
00:23:50,888 --> 00:23:54,307
Mr. Needleman gets very angry
if there are any wrinkles.

396
00:23:56,936 --> 00:23:58,770
Honey, who the hell is Sadie?

397
00:23:58,896 --> 00:24:00,897
Don't you use that kind of Ianguage with me.

398
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:04,400
'Cause I'll have you fired.
Do you understand?

399
00:24:04,485 --> 00:24:07,320
Mrs. Needleman. Okay, I get it.

400
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:11,449
The mall is open, but there
ain't nobody in there shopping.

401
00:24:11,533 --> 00:24:14,494
We need to move him
to someplace safe now.

402
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:16,746
Good idea. What do you suggest?

403
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:18,915
I don't know,
but first thing tomorrow morning,

404
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:20,166
they're on a plane headed here.

405
00:24:20,251 --> 00:24:23,711
You figure it out and tell no one.
Not even me.

406
00:24:25,256 --> 00:24:26,798
Sir, I've got kids at my house.

407
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:28,508
I don't know what I would do
with a whole family of...

408
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:31,010
I don't know. You've been
a prosecutor for over a year.

409
00:24:31,095 --> 00:24:34,264
This is a big case for you, Brian. Handle it.

410
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:37,892
George Needleman? Our guys should be
knocking at his door at any minute.

411
00:24:38,102 --> 00:24:39,185
Great.

412
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:41,854
Well, it'd be great if we could get him
to testify against the Malones,

413
00:24:41,939 --> 00:24:42,981
but that may be a tall order.

414
00:24:43,065 --> 00:24:45,275
Okay, but no deal for him.

415
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:48,778
Look, I'm tired of these people
sticking it to the poor.

416
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:50,071
Sir, if we don't offer him a deal,

417
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:53,449
what incentive does he have
to testify against the mob?

418
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:56,786
It's very simple, Brian.

419
00:24:56,787 --> 00:24:57,954
Yes, sir.

420
00:25:21,145 --> 00:25:22,395
Jake.

421
00:25:23,564 --> 00:25:24,814
What you doing here?

422
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:29,027
You know, I'm just helping your auntie out.

423
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:30,445
What'd you do?

424
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:32,113
I tried to rob her.

425
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:34,449
Boy, what is wrong with you?
I thought you gave up the gang banging.

426
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:36,409
- What the hell?
- I'm in trouble.

427
00:25:36,493 --> 00:25:40,538
My dad put me in charge of
the church's mortgage payoff fundraiser.

428
00:25:40,622 --> 00:25:41,998
I think I may have Iost the money.

429
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:43,499
How?

430
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:46,794
I invested in some company,
and now they won't return my calls.

431
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:48,504
Jake, come on, man.

432
00:25:48,589 --> 00:25:50,340
I know, and he's gonna kill me!

433
00:25:50,424 --> 00:25:51,799
He just wanted
to pay the church's mortgage off

434
00:25:51,884 --> 00:25:53,468
so that he could retire in peace.

435
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:56,554
Look what I did. And he's so sick.

436
00:25:56,638 --> 00:26:00,058
I mean, those people at the church told him
not to make me trustee of the money.

437
00:26:00,142 --> 00:26:02,894
But you know what my dad did?
"What your dad did, Jake?"

438
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:05,563
My dad went up there and told them
I was a changed man!

439
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:06,731
You know what else he said?

440
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:08,649
He said, "Everybody deserves
a second chance."

441
00:26:08,734 --> 00:26:10,193
- Calm down, man.
- You know? He said, "Everybody."

442
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:11,361
- Jake. Jake.
- He did that for me.

443
00:26:11,445 --> 00:26:13,863
- And you know what?
- Hey, hey, hey.

444
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:16,157
Calm down before Madea comes out
and slaps the hell out of you.

445
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:20,912
Look, Brian, I need you to help me
get this money back from Lockwise.

446
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:24,123
Lockwise Industries? New York?

447
00:26:24,208 --> 00:26:25,500
Yeah.

448
00:26:28,045 --> 00:26:30,254
That is a Ponzi scheme, man.

449
00:26:30,339 --> 00:26:32,799
I don't know how I can help you
get any money back from there.

450
00:26:32,883 --> 00:26:34,092
We're investigating them.

451
00:26:34,176 --> 00:26:37,428
A Iot of people invest in these companies,
and those guys Iive this Iavish Iifestyle.

452
00:26:37,513 --> 00:26:39,555
They spend all the money,
so there is no money.

453
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,182
And whatever the government can find,

454
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:44,394
maybe it's pennies on the dollar
that they can get back to the investors.

455
00:26:44,812 --> 00:26:46,646
I don't know how I can help you, man.

456
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:50,483
Brian, I got to get this money back.

457
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:51,901
How much money you talking?

458
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:55,655
$114,000.

459
00:26:56,198 --> 00:27:00,535
You were robbing Madea? Madea doesn't
have that kind of money. What were you...

460
00:27:01,537 --> 00:27:04,705
Jake, don't tell me you were gonna rob
a bunch of old women.

461
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:09,710
How many Iittle old Iadies you think
you gonna have to rob to get $114,000?

462
00:27:09,795 --> 00:27:13,005
114,000.

463
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:15,299
Boy, get your ass off my porch
and go home!

464
00:27:15,384 --> 00:27:16,801
Yes, ma'am!

465
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:20,721
Help me get this money back.

466
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:24,767
Oh, man. Auntie Madea, man.

467
00:27:25,561 --> 00:27:26,561
What am I doing?

468
00:27:26,937 --> 00:27:28,896
Hey, hey, Madea.

469
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:31,107
Hey, Brian. Hey, Brian.

470
00:27:31,442 --> 00:27:32,525
Hey.

471
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:33,860
I don't know why the hell
you go in the bathroom

472
00:27:33,944 --> 00:27:35,153
and Ieave the toilet seat up, Mabel.

473
00:27:35,237 --> 00:27:36,612
Hey, Daddy.

474
00:27:36,697 --> 00:27:38,072
Do I know you?

475
00:27:39,158 --> 00:27:41,284
I'm past 18 now. You can stop pretending
Iike you don't know me,

476
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:42,452
so you don't have to pay child support.

477
00:27:42,536 --> 00:27:45,538
Hey, son. How you doing?
I Iove you so much. So good to see you.

478
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:47,457
You want something to eat?
I'm making a sandwich for Joe.

479
00:27:47,541 --> 00:27:50,793
I wouldn't eat that, son.
I wouldn't eat that at all.

480
00:27:50,878 --> 00:27:53,629
I believe she be trying to kill me
for my insurance money.

481
00:27:53,714 --> 00:27:55,715
You ain't got no insurance money.

482
00:27:56,175 --> 00:27:58,968
In that case, I'm gonna eat this sandwich
she done made.

483
00:27:59,052 --> 00:28:00,636
I'm not trying to kill you
for no insurance money.

484
00:28:00,721 --> 00:28:01,721
I'm gonna kill you 'cause I want you dead.

485
00:28:01,847 --> 00:28:03,222
I just want you completely dead.

486
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:07,393
Just no Iife in you at all. Just not breathing.
Just maggot food.

487
00:28:08,729 --> 00:28:10,813
Here, son, try to taste that for me.

488
00:28:10,898 --> 00:28:13,232
Hey, I'm not tasting that. Thank you.

489
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:15,401
What you doing here, son? What you want?

490
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:17,904
Well, I wanted to talk to you, Madea. I have...

491
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:19,489
You want some money or something?
I ain't got no money.

492
00:28:19,573 --> 00:28:21,407
You don't need to be coming over here
asking me for no money.

493
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:23,367
Daddy, I didn't ask you for any money.

494
00:28:24,328 --> 00:28:25,745
Good. Then Ioan me some,

495
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:28,915
'cause I need a Iittle change
for my Friday night Iights.

496
00:28:28,999 --> 00:28:30,416
What are you talking about?

497
00:28:30,501 --> 00:28:35,171
I be running them hoes, dawg.
I be running them hoes.

498
00:28:35,923 --> 00:28:37,423
Shut up, fool.

499
00:28:38,008 --> 00:28:40,676
I ain't got no money either, Brian.
What you want? What you come by here for?

500
00:28:40,761 --> 00:28:42,678
Well, I came by with a proposition.

501
00:28:42,763 --> 00:28:45,014
I just thought, you know,
you might wanna make a Iittle extra money.

502
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:46,599
You know, the Iast time a man told me

503
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:48,935
he had an opportunity for me
to make a Iittle money,

504
00:28:49,061 --> 00:28:52,522
I ended up in Mexico,
chained to 20 other women,

505
00:28:52,606 --> 00:28:54,857
walking down the street, just selling myself.

506
00:28:54,942 --> 00:28:56,526
You do need some money, don't you?

507
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:58,027
Yeah, I could always use
a Iittle bit of money.

508
00:28:58,111 --> 00:28:59,445
Hell, things been tight around here.

509
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:02,031
I was even thinking about
going back to my old job.

510
00:29:02,783 --> 00:29:04,450
- Stripping?
- No.

511
00:29:04,535 --> 00:29:06,118
- Hooking?
- No.

512
00:29:06,203 --> 00:29:07,954
- Robbing?
- No.

513
00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:10,748
- Hit man?
- No.

514
00:29:12,501 --> 00:29:13,501
Slinging?

515
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:15,336
No.

516
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:17,713
I did have some hustle
back in my day, though.

517
00:29:17,798 --> 00:29:21,175
I was doing a thing.
I was doing a thing back then.

518
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:22,885
I done got the better now.

519
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:26,138
Good those days are over here,
'cause you too big to be on a pole, Mabel.

520
00:29:26,265 --> 00:29:29,183
I'm gonna tell you right now about that pole.
You know, they done switched them.

521
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:30,309
When you was back there dancing,

522
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:32,353
they had them telephone poles
you used to swing on.

523
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:34,689
Now, they got them Iittle brass poles.
I seen them.

524
00:29:34,815 --> 00:29:36,274
You'd bend or broke one of them.
You'll bend it.

525
00:29:36,358 --> 00:29:38,276
Your big ass'll break that brass.

526
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,903
Big ass and brass don't mix.

527
00:29:40,988 --> 00:29:44,949
Joe, shut up, please. Just die.
Stop breathing. Okay? Stop breathing.

528
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:48,119
I'm talking about going back to work
at an old folks' home where I used to work.

529
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:50,288
No, no, you don't have to do that.
I got a great idea.

530
00:29:51,707 --> 00:29:53,541
AII right, here's the situation.

531
00:29:53,667 --> 00:29:56,002
I've got five people
that are in a Iittle bit of trouble.

532
00:29:56,128 --> 00:29:57,920
One of them is a witness
on a case that I'm working on.

533
00:29:58,005 --> 00:30:00,298
And I was wondering
if they could stay here for a while.

534
00:30:00,382 --> 00:30:03,718
Just for a couple of months
until the trial is over, maybe?

535
00:30:03,844 --> 00:30:05,678
Here? No.

536
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:07,555
You better shut that up now.
Ain't nobody coming up in here.

537
00:30:07,681 --> 00:30:08,681
Hell to the no. Ain't nobody...

538
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:11,142
You better hush that up now.
Ain't nobody coming up in here.

539
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:12,602
- Daddy.
- What?

540
00:30:12,686 --> 00:30:14,020
No, that's just crazy.

541
00:30:14,146 --> 00:30:19,358
Have some criminal up in this house,
Iooking all crazy, and police Iooking...

542
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:23,904
Hell, that's how Mabel Iive every day,
ain't it? That's your Iife.

543
00:30:24,031 --> 00:30:25,031
Shut up, rectum.

544
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:27,366
Go to hell.

545
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:29,702
- Now, get up.
- I'm up. I'm up.

546
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:33,039
Probably dreaming about Skittles
and Coca-Cola and Pepsi,

547
00:30:33,165 --> 00:30:35,499
diet soda and Mountain Dew
and Honey Buns,

548
00:30:35,584 --> 00:30:37,460
and damn Krispy Kreme and everything else.

549
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:38,586
So you're up?

550
00:30:38,712 --> 00:30:42,214
There you are, Sadie.
You must iron the sheets.

551
00:30:42,341 --> 00:30:45,760
Mr. Needleman gets very angry
if there are any wrinkles.

552
00:30:48,388 --> 00:30:50,222
Honey, who the hell is Sadie?

553
00:30:50,349 --> 00:30:52,350
Don't you use that kind of Ianguage with me.

554
00:30:52,434 --> 00:30:55,853
'Cause I'll have you fired.
Do you understand?

555
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:58,773
Mrs. Needleman. Okay, I get it.

556
00:30:58,899 --> 00:31:02,902
The mall is open, but there
ain't nobody in there shopping.

557
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:05,112
Is somebody after them?

558
00:31:06,156 --> 00:31:07,323
Yes, ma'am.

559
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:11,827
But, wait a minute.
I would not ask you to do this.

560
00:31:11,912 --> 00:31:14,080
You're my aunt. I know they'll be safe here.

561
00:31:14,164 --> 00:31:17,416
Not one person would know they're here.
This is the safest place for them.

562
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:20,503
That's some bull.
He's trying to sell you a Ioad of bull.

563
00:31:21,254 --> 00:31:23,005
- What'd they do?
- I can't tell you that.

564
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:25,383
But I can tell you this. I can tell you this.

565
00:31:25,509 --> 00:31:30,596
You know, you, you pack. You know?
Ain't nobody gonna mess with you.

566
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:31,847
And this is the safest place for them.

567
00:31:31,932 --> 00:31:35,601
You could be Iike their
witness protector, Madea.

568
00:31:36,395 --> 00:31:38,687
Look here, don't be trying
to butter me up and all that stuff.

569
00:31:38,772 --> 00:31:40,439
I see what you're trying to butter me up.

570
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:42,108
Yeah, I know I'm packing.

571
00:31:42,234 --> 00:31:45,277
I know I can hold some things down,
but, no, I don't want nobody up in here.

572
00:31:45,404 --> 00:31:46,612
I'm sorry. Absolutely not.

573
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:49,365
I cannot do that. You're gonna have to find
somewhere else for them to go.

574
00:31:49,449 --> 00:31:52,368
The answer's a flat-out no,
and I am not changing my mind.

575
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:54,954
My no mean "no," my yes mean "yes."

576
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:57,206
And my "maybe" mean "get the hell out."
I'm sorry.

577
00:31:57,290 --> 00:32:00,626
Absolutely not. Flat-out no.
Ain't gonna happen. Get on out of here. No.

578
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:02,378
Too bad, then.

579
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:06,132
I'll just tell my boss we'll have to find
somewhere else for them to stay.

580
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:10,428
Guess some other Iucky person
will make that $4,000 a month.

581
00:32:10,971 --> 00:32:12,805
You know what?

582
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:16,058
I believe it would be the greatest
Christianity thing I could do

583
00:32:16,143 --> 00:32:17,309
to help somebody in need.

584
00:32:17,394 --> 00:32:20,312
So I'm gonna go ahead
and make up these sheets and clean up.

585
00:32:20,397 --> 00:32:23,315
Mabel, you know, I believe I'm gonna go
drag that cot out of that garage.

586
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,651
I got a cot back there,
and we can put a sheet up in my room.

587
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:29,155
We could share, make sure we got
enough room for everybody up in here.

588
00:32:29,281 --> 00:32:30,489
So is that a yes?

589
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:32,825
Ain't nothing wrong with that cot.
Ain't nothing wrong with it at all.

590
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:36,078
Got a Iittle mold growing in it, but that's
all right. As Iong as you don't breathe...

591
00:33:14,367 --> 00:33:15,951
Where the hell are we?

592
00:33:16,036 --> 00:33:17,620
Honey, we are in the South.

593
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:18,787
Yes, ma'am.

594
00:33:18,872 --> 00:33:22,541
And it brings back pretty fond memories.

595
00:33:22,626 --> 00:33:23,709
Of what, Grams?

596
00:33:24,377 --> 00:33:27,379
A boat and a man, and...

597
00:33:27,464 --> 00:33:30,049
My, he had such a big...

598
00:33:32,636 --> 00:33:33,886
Boat.

599
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:37,806
Hi. George?

600
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:40,893
Yes, I'm George,

601
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:45,731
and this is my daughter, Cindy,
and my wife, Kate, and my son, Howie,

602
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:47,816
- and my mother, Barbara.
- Hi, how are you?

603
00:33:49,236 --> 00:33:51,320
The man in the boat.

604
00:33:58,078 --> 00:33:59,828
Don't have a clue.

605
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:04,208
Cute man.

606
00:34:07,087 --> 00:34:08,420
Well, I'm Brian Simmons,

607
00:34:08,505 --> 00:34:11,006
and I just want all of you to know
you're gonna be in safe hands, okay?

608
00:34:11,091 --> 00:34:12,258
I'm a federal prosecutor,

609
00:34:12,342 --> 00:34:14,343
and we have a very safe place for you
and the entire family.

610
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:23,102
Well, here we go, kids.

611
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:24,353
This way, ma'am.

612
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:25,771
Place Iooks haunted.

613
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:30,067
Is this neighborhood safe?

614
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:33,320
- It's very safe.
- Okay.

615
00:34:33,446 --> 00:34:37,074
There's no safer place
for you and your family. Trust me.

616
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:42,246
This is not a hotel.

617
00:34:44,624 --> 00:34:47,793
Okay, Madea's gonna Iove this one.

618
00:34:53,133 --> 00:34:54,466
Madea?

619
00:34:55,635 --> 00:34:56,969
How's my favorite aunt, Madea?

620
00:34:58,346 --> 00:34:59,597
That Brian? Come on in.

621
00:34:59,973 --> 00:35:02,266
The family's here
that I was telling you about.

622
00:35:19,159 --> 00:35:20,451
Hello.

623
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:28,000
Brian, what the hell's going on?

624
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:31,545
Madea, this is the family
that I was telling you about.

625
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:38,344
You forgot to mention one Iittle
important thing about this family.

626
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:41,138
What's that?

627
00:35:44,184 --> 00:35:46,018
Don't play with me.

628
00:35:47,187 --> 00:35:49,188
Madea, these are the Needlemans,

629
00:35:49,314 --> 00:35:51,440
and they'll be staying with you
for a few months.

630
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:53,525
What? Months?

631
00:35:54,194 --> 00:35:56,403
Are you joking? What, is he joking?

632
00:35:56,529 --> 00:35:57,655
Cindy.

633
00:35:57,739 --> 00:36:00,032
Dad, I can't stay here.

634
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:02,117
What, are we sharecroppers now?

635
00:36:02,202 --> 00:36:04,161
Honey, not nice.

636
00:36:04,245 --> 00:36:06,246
Hi, I'm George.

637
00:36:06,373 --> 00:36:08,165
And I'm his mother, Barbara.

638
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:11,043
And I'm his wife, Kate,
and these are our kids, Howie and Cindy.

639
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:13,796
I'm his child. I'm not her daughter.

640
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,214
Dad, I can't stay here.

641
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:17,883
You know, I think it's kind of nice here.

642
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:19,551
- I Iike it.
- Yeah, you would, you moron.

643
00:36:19,678 --> 00:36:21,887
- Would you...
- This is great. Just great.

644
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:24,890
- Honey.
- Yeah, "vacation" my ass.

645
00:36:25,392 --> 00:36:26,892
Hello, trip from hell.

646
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:34,858
Okay. Look here,

647
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:39,321
would y'all go on into the Iiving room
and have a seat, please?

648
00:36:39,406 --> 00:36:42,950
I would Iike to talk to my nephew
in private just a moment.

649
00:36:43,076 --> 00:36:44,451
Thank you so much for...

650
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:47,121
It's gonna be so Iovely
having all of y'all here.

651
00:36:47,247 --> 00:36:49,998
Yes, just wonderful. Wonderful.

652
00:36:50,083 --> 00:36:51,917
We'll be right in.

653
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:02,636
- What did you do that for?
- What the hell wrong with you?

654
00:37:03,388 --> 00:37:06,265
You done brought these folks up
in this house. What is wrong with you?

655
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:09,685
Madea, Iisten. Okay,
I know that they're not African-American.

656
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:11,562
I don't care nothing
about the color of their skin.

657
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:14,565
I wanna know how in the hell
I'm supposed to hide five white folks

658
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:17,484
in a neighborhood where we ain't even got
white cats or white cars.

659
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:20,028
Ain't nothing white around here.
If the police come in this neighborhood,

660
00:37:20,113 --> 00:37:22,322
they don't even come in a white car.
They send a black SUV.

661
00:37:22,449 --> 00:37:26,702
I understand, but Iisten, Iisten.
I know that you can figure it out.

662
00:37:26,786 --> 00:37:27,786
I know you'll work it out.

663
00:37:27,871 --> 00:37:32,666
Boy, hear me clearly and good
when I say this to you.

664
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:35,461
Son, I don't know how to hide these people.

665
00:37:35,545 --> 00:37:39,798
You can do it. $4,000 a month. $4,000.

666
00:37:40,467 --> 00:37:41,467
You ain't Iistening to me, son.

667
00:37:41,551 --> 00:37:43,594
These people are gonna stick out
around here

668
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:46,346
Iike I would stick out
at a Republica Convention.

669
00:37:46,473 --> 00:37:49,808
Do I Iook Iike I'm a Newt Ginger fan?
Do I Iook Iike I Iike Newt Gingery?

670
00:37:49,893 --> 00:37:53,687
Madea, okay, okay. But you'll figure it out.
I know you'll figure it out.

671
00:37:56,149 --> 00:37:57,983
Are we sitting on plastic?

672
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:00,319
Mabel, I can't find the phone book.

673
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:02,529
I'm trying to find somebody.
Where are the White Pages?

674
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:04,740
My.

675
00:38:05,575 --> 00:38:07,493
The man in the boat.

676
00:38:10,163 --> 00:38:11,663
Hello.

677
00:38:16,044 --> 00:38:17,336
Hey.

678
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:33,185
Mabel, they white folks.

679
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:35,354
Really? I didn't notice.

680
00:38:36,231 --> 00:38:37,856
Come on. I'll introduce you.

681
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:44,696
Needleman family, this is my father, Joe.
You already met my Aunt Madea.

682
00:38:47,116 --> 00:38:52,371
Dad, this is Howie, Kate, George, Cindy,
and Barbara.

683
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:56,583
It Iooks Iike she's undressing me
with her eyes.

684
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:02,005
Now, I'm sure that the agents told you,
but I just want to reiterate.

685
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:04,716
You can't have any contact with anyone
from your past as Iong as you're here.

686
00:39:04,801 --> 00:39:05,843
Do you understand?

687
00:39:05,927 --> 00:39:07,052
Dad?

688
00:39:07,387 --> 00:39:09,096
Honey, I'm sorry.

689
00:39:10,265 --> 00:39:12,099
This is crazy.

690
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:14,726
You suck.

691
00:39:16,145 --> 00:39:17,855
Did she just say... I know she...

692
00:39:17,939 --> 00:39:19,606
Did that child just say
she sucked to her daddy?

693
00:39:19,732 --> 00:39:23,777
Lord, have mercy.
What generation is this? You can't...

694
00:39:24,404 --> 00:39:27,155
You better hurry up
and get them the hell out of here.

695
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:29,783
Mabel gonna kill that Iittle girl.

696
00:39:29,868 --> 00:39:33,495
But, Cindy, this is only until the trial is over.
Isn't that right, Brian?

697
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:36,123
Yes, just until the trial is over.

698
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:38,041
I hate you.

699
00:39:38,668 --> 00:39:41,461
That girl says she hate him. Oh, Lord,
somebody gonna have to help me.

700
00:39:41,546 --> 00:39:43,672
God, help me. God, help me.

701
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:46,550
George, I know it's been
a rough day for you, so I tell you what.

702
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:48,886
I'll come by tomorrow morning about 9:00,
pick you up.

703
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:51,096
We'll go to the office
and begin working on this case, okay?

704
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:56,059
So, Madea, why don't you show your
house guests where they'll be staying?

705
00:39:56,144 --> 00:39:59,271
Yeah, go on and show them, Mabel.
I ain't trying to go up there with them.

706
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:03,150
That one right there,
I don't Iike the way she's Iooking at me.

707
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:06,236
Well, you can show me to the door.
I'm getting back on that plane.

708
00:40:06,321 --> 00:40:07,654
- Honey.
- Excuse us.

709
00:40:07,739 --> 00:40:10,407
- You don't talk Iike that. Watch your mouth.
- Are you kidding me? Seriously.

710
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:11,700
Your ass trying to get me a case.

711
00:40:11,784 --> 00:40:13,619
That's what you trying to do.
You're trying to get me a case.

712
00:40:14,329 --> 00:40:17,331
Better get a speedy trial.
I'm gonna tell you that right now.

713
00:40:18,291 --> 00:40:20,292
I'll get a speedy trial.

714
00:40:24,756 --> 00:40:26,465
What's happening to us?

715
00:40:27,508 --> 00:40:30,218
Kate, if I'd known

716
00:40:30,303 --> 00:40:33,722
that taking care of my family
would Iead us to this, I would've...

717
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:36,600
This wasn't about family.
This was about you.

718
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:39,061
We have way more than we needed.

719
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:42,606
This was about greed.

720
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:44,149
You know, sweetheart,

721
00:40:44,233 --> 00:40:48,737
I seem to recall you were very happy
with my promotion, too.

722
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:50,238
What were you thinking?

723
00:40:51,574 --> 00:40:56,244
I don't know.
I wasn't even aware this was going on.

724
00:40:56,329 --> 00:40:59,581
You're not aware
of a Iot of things going on now.

725
00:41:01,668 --> 00:41:03,835
- Kate...
- I don't wanna talk about this.

726
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,380
I'm gonna unpack my bag and go to sleep.

727
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:09,049
We're done. It's done.

728
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:13,762
It's gonna end just Iike that?

729
00:41:13,846 --> 00:41:15,305
Come on, man. Don't Iet her pimp you.

730
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:17,557
She wanna go to sleep? Knock her ass out.

731
00:41:17,934 --> 00:41:20,894
Joe, shut the hell up.
They're having a private conversation

732
00:41:20,979 --> 00:41:23,480
in a room about not being aware
of what's going on.

733
00:41:23,564 --> 00:41:25,565
If he ain't aware,
that is between the two of them.

734
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:28,610
Shut up. Let them have
their private moment, please.

735
00:41:28,695 --> 00:41:32,364
When a door is closed, that mean
you ain't supposed to be Iistening.

736
00:41:32,448 --> 00:41:34,866
Leave them people alone. Shut the hell up.

737
00:41:34,951 --> 00:41:36,827
- Mabel, you shut up.
- No, you shut the hell up.

738
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:38,954
Mabel, I'm older than you.
I'll do whatever the hell I want to do.

739
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:40,539
Yeah, it's my house.
You gonna shut up up in here

740
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:42,499
or I'm gonna come up and
cut your vocal cords out.

741
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:44,084
You ain't gonna be able to say
a damn thing!

742
00:41:44,293 --> 00:41:45,293
Good night.

743
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:00,058
What the hell?

744
00:42:02,437 --> 00:42:04,479
Boy! Boy!

745
00:42:08,985 --> 00:42:10,652
Is that you farting, son?

746
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:13,280
It wasn't me.

747
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:15,699
Fart one more time.
That's all I'm gonna tell you.

748
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:17,576
Fart one more time.

749
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:21,121
In here farting Iike that.

750
00:42:21,873 --> 00:42:25,000
What's wrong with you, boy?
That's doggone insane.

751
00:42:25,084 --> 00:42:26,877
Hello, Joe.

752
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:29,588
You wanna give it a go?

753
00:42:31,466 --> 00:42:33,175
Mabel.

754
00:42:34,886 --> 00:42:38,472
Mabel, they trying to get me.

755
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:41,308
No, no, trying to get me

756
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:44,352
Iike they get them football players
and them basketball players.

757
00:42:44,437 --> 00:42:48,732
I don't think so. No, no, no.

758
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:50,317
I won't bite.

759
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:12,756
Lord, Lord, Lord.

760
00:43:15,968 --> 00:43:17,511
You staring at me?

761
00:43:19,472 --> 00:43:23,100
No, no, I wasn't staring at you.

762
00:43:23,184 --> 00:43:24,392
Okay.

763
00:43:25,228 --> 00:43:28,396
I was watching the wildebeest
in its natural habitat, though.

764
00:43:28,481 --> 00:43:30,148
Excuse me?

765
00:43:33,653 --> 00:43:34,820
That's not nice.

766
00:43:34,904 --> 00:43:39,157
Yeah. Her butt must be hungry,
'cause it's chewing that dress alive.

767
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:45,539
If you need anything, anything at all,

768
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:49,668
I'm just a whisper away.

769
00:43:49,752 --> 00:43:51,545
AII you got to do is whisper.

770
00:43:56,425 --> 00:43:58,552
Okay, I think I'm done.

771
00:43:59,262 --> 00:44:01,388
Where you rushing off to?

772
00:44:02,682 --> 00:44:04,850
- Yoga's over.
- Okay.

773
00:44:04,934 --> 00:44:06,017
Creepy.

774
00:44:06,102 --> 00:44:07,435
- Hi.

775
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,771
- I'm good. Thank you.
- I see you was up in there doing that yoda.

776
00:44:09,856 --> 00:44:12,190
It's yoga.

777
00:44:12,275 --> 00:44:14,317
No, baby, I don't have no yogurt.
I don't eat that.

778
00:44:14,402 --> 00:44:17,863
That mess my stomach up.
It's got that abiffidus bacalarus in it.

779
00:44:17,947 --> 00:44:19,948
I can't have that. So you go on
and get yourself something else.

780
00:44:20,032 --> 00:44:22,784
I might have some in that fridge there,
but I don't eat it.

781
00:44:22,869 --> 00:44:24,077
Well, it Iooks Iike you've been cooking.

782
00:44:24,203 --> 00:44:26,329
Yeah, I wanted to feed your family
their first day in my house.

783
00:44:26,414 --> 00:44:28,707
I wanted to make sure

00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:38,842

00:44:52,899 --> 00:44:54,983
No, baby, I don't eat crabs.
You can't eat no crabs.

795
00:44:55,067 --> 00:44:57,819
You gonna have crabs and yogurt?
You about to mess your stomach up.

796
00:44:57,904 --> 00:45:00,155
Ain't no seafood on here, honey.
I'm allergic to seafood.

797
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:01,573
Ain't no seafood here nowhere.

798
00:45:01,657 --> 00:45:03,408
Is that how you stay so thin?

799
00:45:03,492 --> 00:45:06,036
No, honey, I don't eat that stuff.
Where your family?

800
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:08,205
They're sleeping still.

801
00:45:08,289 --> 00:45:10,957
What? They got to get up.

802
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:14,628
No, baby, your children got to go to school.
I got to get them registered,

803
00:45:14,754 --> 00:45:17,214
and George is supposed to see Brian

804
00:45:17,298 --> 00:45:19,090
So, no, no, no, you got to get them up.

805
00:45:19,175 --> 00:45:21,843
Okay, well, I was just gonna Iet...
You know, they're so exhausted.

806
00:45:21,928 --> 00:45:24,179
- No, I'll go get them up. Here, you take this.
- Okay.

807
00:45:24,263 --> 00:45:25,472
Take this and stir that real good.

808
00:45:25,598 --> 00:45:27,641
- Whip it real, real good. You understand?
- Yeah, I understand.

809
00:45:27,767 --> 00:45:29,768
AII right, you need to put something... Here.

810
00:45:29,852 --> 00:45:31,603
Here, put this on.
Put this on while you whip.

811
00:45:31,687 --> 00:45:33,188
- You don't wanna get that on you.
- Okay. No.

812
00:45:33,272 --> 00:45:34,481
- Put that on. Okay, whip it.
- Thank you.

813
00:45:34,607 --> 00:45:36,650
- Whip it real good.
- I will.

814
00:45:41,864 --> 00:45:44,449
George, get up out this bed, son.

815
00:45:48,871 --> 00:45:50,038
Kate.

816
00:45:51,457 --> 00:45:53,792
I had this horrible dream

817
00:45:54,126 --> 00:45:57,587
that we were in trouble with the FBI,

818
00:45:57,672 --> 00:46:01,633
and we moved into this house
with an old woman who Iooked Iike...

819
00:46:03,219 --> 00:46:04,302
Like what?

820
00:46:05,388 --> 00:46:06,513
You.

821
00:46:07,556 --> 00:46:11,184
It's not a dream. It's really happening.

822
00:46:11,644 --> 00:46:13,353
I'm in so deep.

823
00:46:15,690 --> 00:46:18,817
George, you need to get up out this bed.
Brian is waiting for you down at the office.

824
00:46:18,901 --> 00:46:20,610
He said he was gonna have you
come down there this morning.

825
00:46:20,695 --> 00:46:22,445
Now, get up on out this bed.

826
00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:25,699
My Iife is over.
I'm not getting out of this bed.

827
00:46:25,825 --> 00:46:28,034
There's no reason to get out of this bed.

828
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:31,538
You need a reason? You need a reason?

829
00:46:33,749 --> 00:46:36,251
You better get your ass out this bed.

830
00:46:40,881 --> 00:46:43,258
Is that enough reason for you?

831
00:46:43,342 --> 00:46:44,426
Let me tell you something, son.

832
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:47,512
I don't allow nobody to feel sorry
for themselves in my house.

833
00:46:47,596 --> 00:46:49,389
I don't know what you did.
I don't care what you did.

834
00:46:49,515 --> 00:46:50,515
Do you understand?

835
00:46:50,599 --> 00:46:52,183
I need you to get up out this bed,
come downstairs,

836
00:46:52,268 --> 00:46:55,103
have breakfast with your family,
Brian is waiting on you down at the office

837
00:46:55,187 --> 00:46:56,521
to talk about
whatever y'all need to talk about.

838
00:46:56,605 --> 00:46:59,983
It ain't my business. I don't wanna know,
but you gonna get up out this bed.

839
00:47:00,067 --> 00:47:01,943
If I come back up these stairs,
and you still in this bed,

840
00:47:02,028 --> 00:47:03,653
do you have any idea what I'm gonna do?

841
00:47:03,738 --> 00:47:07,032
I'm gonna get completely naked,
and get up in there with you and spoon.

842
00:47:08,242 --> 00:47:09,492
I'm up.

843
00:47:09,577 --> 00:47:10,577
Thank you.

844
00:47:10,703 --> 00:47:13,955
I am definitely up.
You don't have to come back.

845
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:17,417
I'm coming right down.
I'm coming right down.

846
00:47:19,253 --> 00:47:20,879
I'm on my way.

847
00:47:32,016 --> 00:47:33,058
Get up, son.

848
00:47:35,895 --> 00:47:36,936
What's wrong?

849
00:47:37,897 --> 00:47:39,689
You just scared me.

850
00:47:39,774 --> 00:47:44,069
You're just so huge.
Like a giant bag of Skittles.

851
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:47,822
AII right, you better get the hell up,

852
00:47:47,907 --> 00:47:49,741
or when I come back up in here,
you know what's gonna happen?

853
00:47:49,867 --> 00:47:52,243
You gonna taste the rainbow.

854
00:47:52,328 --> 00:47:55,288
We need to move him
to someplace safe now.

855
00:47:55,373 --> 00:47:57,540
Good idea. What do you suggest?

856
00:47:57,625 --> 00:47:59,709
I don't know,
but first thing tomorrow morning,

857
00:47:59,794 --> 00:48:00,960
they're on a plane headed here.

858
00:48:01,045 --> 00:48:04,506
You figure it out and tell no one.
Not even me.

859
00:48:06,050 --> 00:48:07,592
Sir, I've got kids at my house.

860
00:48:07,676 --> 00:48:09,302
I don't know what I would do
with a whole family of...

861
00:48:09,387 --> 00:48:11,805
I don't know. You've been
a prosecutor for over a year.

862
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:15,058
This is a big case for you, Brian. Handle it.

863
00:48:15,393 --> 00:48:17,435
- Now, get up.
- I'm up. I'm up.

864
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:20,772
Probably dreaming about Skittles
and Coca-Cola and Pepsi,

865
00:48:20,898 --> 00:48:23,233
diet soda and Mountain Dew
and Honey Buns,

866
00:48:23,317 --> 00:48:25,193
and damn Krispy Kreme and everything else.

867
00:48:25,277 --> 00:48:26,319
So you're up?

868
00:48:26,445 --> 00:48:29,948
There you are, Sadie.
You must iron the sheets.

869
00:48:30,074 --> 00:48:33,493
Mr. Needleman gets very angry
if there are any wrinkles.

870
00:48:36,122 --> 00:48:37,956
Honey, who the hell is Sadie?

871
00:48:38,082 --> 00:48:40,083
Don't you use that kind of Ianguage with me.

872
00:48:40,167 --> 00:48:43,586
'Cause I'll have you fired.
Do you understand?

873
00:48:43,671 --> 00:48:46,506
Mrs. Needleman. Okay, I get it.

874
00:48:46,632 --> 00:48:50,635
The mall is open, but there
ain't nobody in there shopping.

875
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:53,555
What's that smell?

876
00:48:53,639 --> 00:48:56,141
It's called food. I'm cooking.

877
00:48:56,267 --> 00:48:59,269
It smells up the whole house. It permeates.

878
00:48:59,353 --> 00:49:04,149
Thank you. You always were
the best colored help we could ever find.

879
00:49:06,485 --> 00:49:09,279
Okay, Brian playing a joke on me.

880
00:49:09,363 --> 00:49:12,740
I'm being Punk'd. I know I'm being Punk'd.
Where the camera at?

881
00:49:12,825 --> 00:49:14,784
Little girl, I need you to get up, honey.

882
00:49:14,869 --> 00:49:16,661
Go away.

883
00:49:22,209 --> 00:49:26,212
Never had no child talk to me
Iike this before. Lordy.

884
00:49:26,338 --> 00:49:30,216
Honey, I got to bring y'all down to school
and get you registered. Now, get up.

885
00:49:32,344 --> 00:49:34,137
I said, go away.

886
00:49:36,724 --> 00:49:39,851
She just yelled at me in my house.
I don't know what she...

887
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:41,269
Little girl,
I'm gonna tell you one more time...

888
00:49:41,353 --> 00:49:43,396
I said, go away!

889
00:49:51,197 --> 00:49:52,989
I know she didn't just...

890
00:49:58,162 --> 00:50:00,163
Who the hell you think
you talking to?

891
00:50:02,166 --> 00:50:05,084
Oh, my God! What is wrong with you?

892
00:50:05,211 --> 00:50:07,253
This is my house.

893
00:50:07,379 --> 00:50:09,881
You Iive by my rules
when you are in my house.

894
00:50:10,007 --> 00:50:12,175
You're too young for that, Iittle girl.
You don't want none of this.

895
00:50:12,259 --> 00:50:16,262
Please, do yourself a favor, honey.
You do not want none of this.

896
00:50:16,388 --> 00:50:19,432
Behave while you're here. If not, you will...

897
00:50:22,895 --> 00:50:25,021
Girl, you...

898
00:50:25,105 --> 00:50:27,690
Girl, you just don't know...

899
00:50:31,445 --> 00:50:33,404
I don't know who she thinks
she's talking to.

900
00:50:33,739 --> 00:50:35,198
She's insane.

901
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:40,703
Hello?

902
00:50:41,455 --> 00:50:42,622
Is that you, son?

903
00:50:45,251 --> 00:50:47,585
- Yes, sir.
- Well, come on in here.

904
00:50:50,047 --> 00:50:51,714
What are you doing here, Dad?

905
00:50:52,424 --> 00:50:54,592
Well, I'm feeling better, much better.

906
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:58,763
No, you're not.
You're supposed to be at home in bed.

907
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:02,934
I just had to stop by here
to make sure everything's all right.

908
00:51:03,435 --> 00:51:04,435
It's all fine.

909
00:51:04,937 --> 00:51:10,692
I've decided to tell the church
the third Sunday I'm retiring.

910
00:51:11,151 --> 00:51:13,152
I thought you were gonna wait
till summer to do that.

911
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:16,698
No, I can't do that, son. I'm too tired.

912
00:51:16,782 --> 00:51:19,200
It'll sure make the burden so much easier

913
00:51:19,285 --> 00:51:24,247
to know that everything I've worked for
all these years is gonna be Iooked after.

914
00:51:24,331 --> 00:51:27,625
I am very proud of you, son.
Really proud of you.

915
00:51:28,961 --> 00:51:30,878
Don't be proud of me.

916
00:51:30,963 --> 00:51:33,506
Are you kidding me?
I have to tell you I'm proud of you.

917
00:51:33,632 --> 00:51:36,759
You know something?
After your mother died,

918
00:51:36,844 --> 00:51:38,136
I wasn't sure you were gonna make it.

919
00:51:39,179 --> 00:51:42,265
You were so far out there in those streets.

920
00:51:42,349 --> 00:51:44,183
But, praise the Lord, Iook at you now.

921
00:51:44,310 --> 00:51:48,938
Helping me run the church,
handling our mortgage payment fund.

922
00:51:49,023 --> 00:51:50,648
No, I am very proud of you, son.

923
00:51:51,066 --> 00:51:53,443
You know, the congregation
is gonna be a Iittle bit upset

924
00:51:53,527 --> 00:51:57,488
when I tell them that I'm retiring,
so to ease the pain,

925
00:51:57,573 --> 00:52:01,701
I'm going to tell them that we have raised
the money to pay off the church.

926
00:52:03,203 --> 00:52:04,954
They're gonna rejoice.

927
00:52:06,332 --> 00:52:07,790
Well done, son.

928
00:52:07,875 --> 00:52:09,208
Yes, sir.

929
00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:21,929
I don't see her out here. Y'all come on.
Come on. Hurry up.

930
00:52:22,014 --> 00:52:25,391
She always nosy as hell,
over there Iooking at everything.

931
00:52:25,476 --> 00:52:26,851
Hurry up.

932
00:52:31,899 --> 00:52:34,484
- Come on. Get in the car.
- Madea.

933
00:52:34,568 --> 00:52:35,735
Madea.

934
00:52:35,944 --> 00:52:37,070
Hey, Hattie.

935
00:52:38,030 --> 00:52:39,197
How you doing?

936
00:52:39,281 --> 00:52:40,573
- I'm good, baby.
- Open the door.

937
00:52:40,657 --> 00:52:43,284
- Come here a minute.
- I can't talk to you right now, honey.

938
00:52:43,369 --> 00:52:46,287
This my cousins, and they done Iost
all the pigmentation in their skin overnight.

939
00:52:46,372 --> 00:52:47,663
- Your cousins?
- Yes.

940
00:52:47,748 --> 00:52:48,748
Can I help you?

941
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:51,250
No, I got to take them
to the doctor right now.

942
00:52:51,335 --> 00:52:53,544
I'll see you Iater on. Take care.

943
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:00,051
And that's all you know?

944
00:53:00,135 --> 00:53:02,428
That's all I know. I swear it.

945
00:53:02,763 --> 00:53:04,055
I don't believe you.

946
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:07,225
I'm telling you the truth.

947
00:53:07,643 --> 00:53:10,645
You're going to jail for a very Iong time.

948
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:20,655
I can't go to jail. I didn't do anything wrong.

949
00:53:20,739 --> 00:53:23,116
George, calm down, okay?

950
00:53:23,784 --> 00:53:26,869
For what it's worth, I believe you.

951
00:53:27,871 --> 00:53:31,916
Oh, boy, somebody believes me.
Isn't that wonderful?

952
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:36,546
Let's crack open some champagne,
because somebody believes me.

953
00:53:37,506 --> 00:53:39,424
Oh, God, I'm in trouble.

954
00:53:42,928 --> 00:53:47,432
I think they can believe you, too,
but you have to help me make them believe.

955
00:53:48,183 --> 00:53:52,353
Just tell me what you want me to do.

956
00:53:52,438 --> 00:53:55,231
What do I need to do here?

957
00:53:55,315 --> 00:53:58,067
Okay, that's a good attitude, George.
Really good attitude.

958
00:53:58,152 --> 00:54:01,028
Everything that wasn't shredded
or destroyed is in these files.

959
00:54:01,113 --> 00:54:05,199
This is your ticket to freedom.
You're the CFO. I'm sure you can find it.

960
00:54:05,951 --> 00:54:07,160
Okay, well,

961
00:54:07,411 --> 00:54:11,998
this is the crux of the problem here, Brian,

962
00:54:12,082 --> 00:54:17,211
because I can't seem to find anything
in here that will help.

963
00:54:17,296 --> 00:54:19,172
I wanna help you. I really do.

964
00:54:19,256 --> 00:54:23,509
It doesn't make any sense
for me not to wanna help.

965
00:54:23,594 --> 00:54:26,304
Now does it? Does it? No. No.

966
00:54:26,388 --> 00:54:29,849
I mean, don't you think
I would help if I could?

967
00:54:33,604 --> 00:54:35,480
- Are you okay?
- No, I just...

968
00:54:35,564 --> 00:54:38,441
I feel Iike I... I wanna hit something.

969
00:54:38,525 --> 00:54:40,359
Hit the chair. Hit something.

970
00:54:50,954 --> 00:54:51,996
I'm sorry.

971
00:55:07,846 --> 00:55:09,931
That was a Iovely evening.

972
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:14,352
There ain't never been no evening, Iady.
I don't know you.

973
00:55:14,853 --> 00:55:18,773
Stop it. There's no one around.

974
00:55:18,857 --> 00:55:21,859
Read my Iips, honey. I don't know you.

975
00:55:22,819 --> 00:55:25,363
You're the man in the boat.

976
00:55:25,489 --> 00:55:27,532
I ain't never had no boat.

977
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:35,122
I bet if I showed you my tattoo,
you might remember.

978
00:55:35,207 --> 00:55:38,000
What tattoo? What you fixing to show me?

979
00:55:42,881 --> 00:55:45,550
I believe you need to see a doctor
about that, honey.

980
00:55:45,634 --> 00:55:48,886
No, that's Betty Boop.

981
00:55:50,889 --> 00:55:54,976
It might have been Betty Boop at one time,
but Betty Boop done drooped.

982
00:55:55,060 --> 00:55:56,644
Betty Boop.

983
00:55:56,728 --> 00:55:59,397
You brought me over in your Iittle boat.

984
00:55:59,523 --> 00:56:04,735
Lady, for the Iast time, okay?
First of all, you insulted me.

985
00:56:04,820 --> 00:56:06,153
'Cause I wouldn't have a Iittle boat.

986
00:56:06,238 --> 00:56:08,656
I'm not a canoe kind of man.
You understand?

987
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:12,493
I'm a yacht, a cruise ship,
Noah's Ark up in this piece.

988
00:56:12,578 --> 00:56:15,746
Only time I was ever in a boat was
that Iittle rowboat belonged to the Army

989
00:56:15,872 --> 00:56:17,748
when I was in New Orleans many years ago.

990
00:56:17,833 --> 00:56:21,002
I'd take people across the water
over there from the bayou to the juke joint,

991
00:56:21,086 --> 00:56:22,503
and I'd charge them a nickel
to get them over there.

992
00:56:22,588 --> 00:56:25,006
And they'd all take the ride and everything.
I'd give them their change.

993
00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:28,426
And somebody gave me a 50-cent tip
that night.

994
00:56:34,016 --> 00:56:35,516
You Barbara Betty Boop.

995
00:56:35,601 --> 00:56:39,437
Yes, I was a nurse in Company B.

996
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:44,609
Yeah, I was in Company C
over there with the colored troops.

997
00:56:44,735 --> 00:56:48,446
Me and a couple of my girlfriends followed
you guys all the way to your barracks.

998
00:56:48,572 --> 00:56:50,948
Yeah, I remember it was four of you.

999
00:56:51,074 --> 00:56:57,371
It was Blanche, Rose, Dorothy, and you.

1000
00:57:00,626 --> 00:57:02,209
I don't even know
how you remember that, honey.

1001
00:57:02,294 --> 00:57:05,212
That was 56, 57 years ago.

1002
00:57:05,297 --> 00:57:07,381
Fifty-three.

1003
00:57:07,466 --> 00:57:09,592
Because George is 52.

1004
00:57:11,970 --> 00:57:13,888
What that got to do with anything?

1005
00:57:16,308 --> 00:57:18,559
What day is it?

1006
00:57:19,061 --> 00:57:22,605
Lady, don't you start...
What you trying to tell me?

1007
00:57:24,608 --> 00:57:25,983
Where am I?

1008
00:57:26,068 --> 00:57:28,736
I think you believe you're trying
to tell me something about George.

1009
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:30,571
- Oh, my goodness.
- Hey.

1010
00:57:30,656 --> 00:57:32,406
I don't know where I am.

1011
00:57:38,830 --> 00:57:40,122
George?

1012
00:57:44,002 --> 00:57:45,086
- Brian.
- Jake.

1013
00:57:45,170 --> 00:57:47,004
You cannot keep calling me Iike this, man.

1014
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:48,964
I'm in the middle of an investigation.
What are you doing?

1015
00:57:49,591 --> 00:57:52,843
My dad wants to announce that he's paying
the church's mortgage off in three weeks.

1016
00:57:52,928 --> 00:57:54,512
I mean, what am I supposed to do?

1017
00:57:54,638 --> 00:57:56,347
Tell him the truth.

1018
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:57,515
That will kill him.

1019
00:57:57,599 --> 00:57:59,934
He'll be very happy
that you told him the truth.

1020
00:58:00,018 --> 00:58:01,602
I can't. I can't do it.

1021
00:58:01,687 --> 00:58:02,937
Jake.

1022
00:58:03,021 --> 00:58:05,022
That's him. That's the dude from the news!

1023
00:58:05,691 --> 00:58:06,941
I ought to kill you!

1024
00:58:07,025 --> 00:58:09,360
- Who is this?
- I'm your worst nightmare.

1025
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:10,778
Will you just...

1026
00:58:10,862 --> 00:58:14,865
You're my worst... I got news for you.
I'm Iiving my worst nightmare, okay?

1027
00:58:14,991 --> 00:58:18,035
And besides, you're a Iittle short
to be a nightmare, aren't you?

1028
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:20,705
I'm short? He called me...
He called me short?

1029
00:58:20,789 --> 00:58:22,373
I'm gonna bust your balls!

1030
00:58:22,457 --> 00:58:25,876
Well, why don't you get in Iine
and bust my balls?

1031
00:58:26,002 --> 00:58:28,462
Because everybody else is busting my balls.

1032
00:58:28,547 --> 00:58:31,674
I don't have any balls Ieft, mister!
How about that?

1033
00:58:32,175 --> 00:58:34,051
I'm gonna... Get off.

1034
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:36,804
Calm down. Nobody's kicking balls.

1035
00:58:36,888 --> 00:58:39,181
George, Jake, I need you both to calm down.

1036
00:58:39,266 --> 00:58:40,725
Is everything all right out there?

1037
00:58:40,851 --> 00:58:42,059
Everything's fine.

1038
00:58:44,187 --> 00:58:45,980
Just keep working. It's all good.

1039
00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:48,733
George, this is Jake.

1040
00:58:49,401 --> 00:58:52,820
His father has a church,
and they were gonna pay off their mortgage,

1041
00:58:52,904 --> 00:58:56,741
and they invested the money in Lockwise,
and they Iost it all.

1042
00:58:56,825 --> 00:58:58,826
So he's a Iittle bit upset.

1043
00:58:58,910 --> 00:59:01,495
- I'm sorry.
- You...

1044
00:59:02,914 --> 00:59:04,623
That's all you got to say? Is you sorry?

1045
00:59:04,708 --> 00:59:06,125
- Jake.
- Hell...

1046
00:59:06,209 --> 00:59:08,461
Yeah. Okay, okay.
You better watch yourself,

1047
00:59:08,545 --> 00:59:09,795
or I'm gonna give you a...

1048
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:13,507
You see this? Big five. Big five.
And you're gonna get it.

1049
00:59:13,592 --> 00:59:15,926
If I didn't have to go to the bathroom,
you'd be in...

1050
00:59:16,011 --> 00:59:17,845
- Where's the bathroom, Brian?
- Okay.

1051
00:59:17,929 --> 00:59:19,054
Third door on the Ieft.

1052
00:59:19,139 --> 00:59:21,056
- Third door on the Ieft.
- Yeah.

1053
00:59:21,975 --> 00:59:23,350
Big five?

1054
00:59:24,644 --> 00:59:27,605
Jake, go home.

1055
00:59:28,899 --> 00:59:31,650
Get a grip, okay? Tell him the truth.

1056
00:59:32,110 --> 00:59:34,153
If anything comes up, I'll call you.

1057
00:59:34,237 --> 00:59:37,198
Can't you just go home?
Elevator's right there.

1058
00:59:47,083 --> 00:59:48,876
How tall are you, son?

1059
00:59:50,128 --> 00:59:52,963
About 6 feet.

1060
00:59:53,298 --> 00:59:55,090
- About 6 feet?
- Yeah.

1061
00:59:56,551 --> 00:59:58,719
Okay. Check.

1062
01:00:01,306 --> 01:00:03,057
You Iike soul music?

1063
01:00:05,477 --> 01:00:09,063
I do. I do. I Iove soul music.

1064
01:00:10,315 --> 01:00:11,649
R-E-S-P-E-C-T.

1065
01:00:11,775 --> 01:00:14,318
Find out what it mean to me.

1066
01:00:14,402 --> 01:00:16,237
No, I dig it.

1067
01:00:16,321 --> 01:00:18,739
You dig it. You dig it?

1068
01:00:20,826 --> 01:00:21,992
Check.

1069
01:00:27,332 --> 01:00:30,501
Your hair's really thick and curly.

1070
01:00:30,627 --> 01:00:33,087
Always been that thick and curly?

1071
01:00:33,171 --> 01:00:34,839
Yeah, it has.

1072
01:00:34,965 --> 01:00:37,758
When I was a kid, I had an afro that was,

1073
01:00:38,468 --> 01:00:41,512
you know, Iarge.

1074
01:00:41,930 --> 01:00:44,682
To here. Big, big hair.

1075
01:00:44,975 --> 01:00:48,394
No, you said it right. You had an afro.
You didn't offend me. You had an afro.

1076
01:00:48,478 --> 01:00:50,271
That's what you called it, an afro. Check.

1077
01:00:50,355 --> 01:00:51,772
An afro.

1078
01:00:55,443 --> 01:00:56,777
Can you swim, son?

1079
01:00:58,321 --> 01:01:00,614
No. No.

1080
01:01:00,699 --> 01:01:03,701
I never got the hang of swimming.

1081
01:01:04,703 --> 01:01:08,372
Never got the hang of it. Yup. Check.

1082
01:01:09,207 --> 01:01:12,877
Hey, I was Iooking at your wife,
she was doing that yoda.

1083
01:01:12,961 --> 01:01:15,671
And she got a nice Iittle butt.

1084
01:01:16,047 --> 01:01:18,215
But it ain't no booty, you know?

1085
01:01:18,341 --> 01:01:22,511
You Iike a butt, or you Iike a booty?

1086
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:28,392
You Iike a booty, one that's a big, old booty
to grab Iike handlebars and use?

1087
01:01:28,476 --> 01:01:31,729
Steer that thing where you want it to go,
you know?

1088
01:01:31,855 --> 01:01:34,565
To be honest,

1089
01:01:34,649 --> 01:01:35,900
I Iove my wife.

1090
01:01:36,026 --> 01:01:38,402
She can't hear you. She can't hear.
Man-to-man, go on and tell me.

1091
01:01:38,486 --> 01:01:41,655
Do you Iike a Iittle cute, nice Iittle butt,
or do you Iike a big butt

1092
01:01:41,740 --> 01:01:44,366
that you can grab that thing
and slap it Iike handlebars?

1093
01:01:45,869 --> 01:01:50,247
Well, I would Iike
a Iittle more on the bottom.

1094
01:01:50,332 --> 01:01:51,749
Harley-Davidson.

1095
01:01:51,875 --> 01:01:52,917
- A Harley?
- Yeah.

1096
01:01:53,043 --> 01:01:54,418
Junk in the trunk.

1097
01:01:54,502 --> 01:01:58,005
Some junk in the trunk. Yeah, more junk.

1098
01:02:00,008 --> 01:02:01,508
As Iong as you're asking.

1099
01:02:04,596 --> 01:02:07,014
I got one Iast question for you, son.

1100
01:02:07,766 --> 01:02:11,936
When you go to the bathroom
and you're at the urinal,

1101
01:02:12,771 --> 01:02:14,939
do you stand there Iike this?

1102
01:02:16,441 --> 01:02:19,526
Or do you just happen
to stand there Iike this?

1103
01:02:21,404 --> 01:02:22,446
Well...

1104
01:02:22,530 --> 01:02:25,032
And when you're finished,
do you have to do this?

1105
01:02:28,370 --> 01:02:30,537
Which one is it for you, son? Which one?

1106
01:02:30,622 --> 01:02:33,624
Well, more Iike the second part.

1107
01:02:34,459 --> 01:02:36,794
Without the thing at the end.

1108
01:02:38,296 --> 01:02:39,463
Check.

1109
01:02:40,256 --> 01:02:43,217
Damn. I'm your daddy.

1110
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:46,887
Excuse me?

1111
01:02:47,389 --> 01:02:49,306
Do you have any Wi-Fi?

1112
01:02:50,266 --> 01:02:52,977
Well, if you ask me nice,
I'll get up and I'll make you some.

1113
01:02:54,312 --> 01:02:57,147
Excuse me. How do you make Wi-Fi?

1114
01:02:58,441 --> 01:03:01,652
Son, you use some flour,
put a Iittle water in it, some powdered sugar,

1115
01:03:01,736 --> 01:03:03,404
you mix it up real good,
and you get your skillet,

1116
01:03:03,488 --> 01:03:04,905
or you get you one of them Wi-Fi irons,

1117
01:03:04,990 --> 01:03:08,158
and you pour it in the Wi-Fi iron
and you close it up.

1118
01:03:08,243 --> 01:03:10,494
I got a Wi-Fi iron in there.

1119
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:12,246
What are you talking about?

1120
01:03:13,331 --> 01:03:16,667
He asked for a Wi-Fi, I got a waffle.
You want a Wi-Fi? I got a waffle.

1121
01:03:16,793 --> 01:03:18,961
Wi-Fi. Internet.

1122
01:03:20,839 --> 01:03:22,673
I don't have none of that.

1123
01:03:22,757 --> 01:03:25,759
Ain't no technology around here at all.
We've been Ieft in the Dark Ages.

1124
01:03:26,511 --> 01:03:28,262
It figures.

1125
01:03:28,346 --> 01:03:29,430
Howie.

1126
01:03:29,514 --> 01:03:31,015
Honey, why do you need
to get on the Internet?

1127
01:03:31,141 --> 01:03:32,599
I'm supposed to do a report.

1128
01:03:32,684 --> 01:03:35,019
I'll help you with your report. Okay, honey?

1129
01:03:35,103 --> 01:03:37,354
It doesn't really matter.
I mean, he's gonna fail.

1130
01:03:37,689 --> 01:03:40,107
- He's dumb Iike his mother.
- Enough.

1131
01:03:40,191 --> 01:03:41,775
Go to hell, Kate.

1132
01:03:44,946 --> 01:03:46,989
Did that child just say, "Go to hell"?

1133
01:03:53,788 --> 01:03:54,955
You all right?

1134
01:03:55,040 --> 01:03:56,957
Yeah. Thanks.

1135
01:03:57,042 --> 01:03:59,376
Come on, sit down and talk to me.

1136
01:04:00,628 --> 01:04:03,756
That child right there. Lord, that Iittle girl
about to make me hurt her.

1137
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:06,800
I know. I'm trying to be understanding.

1138
01:04:06,885 --> 01:04:08,177
Of what?

1139
01:04:09,137 --> 01:04:10,846
She has problems.

1140
01:04:10,930 --> 01:04:12,014
Honey, we all got problems.

1141
01:04:12,098 --> 01:04:14,767
That child ain't supposed to be
talking to you all Iike that. That is crazy.

1142
01:04:14,851 --> 01:04:17,603
What's wrong with that child?
What's she so angry about?

1143
01:04:17,687 --> 01:04:20,355
I don't know.
Just being here and out of school.

1144
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:22,149
Tell that to somebody else, honey.

1145
01:04:22,233 --> 01:04:26,487
That child is angry about something else,
and it's deep, whatever it is.

1146
01:04:26,571 --> 01:04:31,158
It ain't about no school and nothing else.
This water runs deeper than that.

1147
01:04:31,242 --> 01:04:32,534
How do you know?

1148
01:04:32,786 --> 01:04:35,412
Wisdom. I didn't get this old
by not knowing nothing.

1149
01:04:37,624 --> 01:04:41,210
She thinks I'm the reason
that her father divorced her mother.

1150
01:04:42,504 --> 01:04:44,838
I wonder where she'd get that from.

1151
01:04:44,923 --> 01:04:46,090
Are you?

1152
01:04:46,174 --> 01:04:48,842
No. What kind of person do you think I am?

1153
01:04:49,594 --> 01:04:51,095
A woman.

1154
01:04:52,013 --> 01:04:54,473
No, their marriage was over,

1155
01:04:54,557 --> 01:04:59,186
her father filed for divorce already,
but she's hated me ever since she met me.

1156
01:04:59,771 --> 01:05:01,688
And George just sit there,
don't say nothing?

1157
01:05:01,773 --> 01:05:03,315
He just sit there and not say a word?

1158
01:05:03,775 --> 01:05:06,235
George doesn't say anything
to anyone these days.

1159
01:05:06,861 --> 01:05:08,195
Lord, have mercy.

1160
01:05:08,279 --> 01:05:10,030
I know. But she needs him.

1161
01:05:10,115 --> 01:05:12,324
Because her mother, she is so evil.

1162
01:05:12,408 --> 01:05:15,828
She filled her head with all these
horrible things about me and about us.

1163
01:05:15,912 --> 01:05:17,287
And then, two years ago,

1164
01:05:17,372 --> 01:05:20,833
she dropped her off at our doorstep,
hasn't contacted her ever since,

1165
01:05:20,917 --> 01:05:22,417
and now she's angry.

1166
01:05:22,627 --> 01:05:24,878
And now she's up in my house
and she got me worried.

1167
01:05:24,963 --> 01:05:25,963
Honey, I'm just worried.

1168
01:05:26,422 --> 01:05:27,673
She'll be fine.

1169
01:05:27,757 --> 01:05:29,633
I'm not worried about her,
I'm worried about me.

1170
01:05:29,717 --> 01:05:31,510
'Cause I feel Iike I wanna choke her to sleep.

1171
01:05:31,594 --> 01:05:33,804
I just wanna grab her
till the Iife is out of her sometimes.

1172
01:05:33,888 --> 01:05:35,013
She's so flip.

1173
01:05:35,098 --> 01:05:36,431
Yeah, I get it.

1174
01:05:36,516 --> 01:05:39,393
And when she talk back to you,
you just have a Iittle argument with her

1175
01:05:39,477 --> 01:05:42,146
and you just Iet her start her mouth
and say whatever she want to say?

1176
01:05:42,230 --> 01:05:43,313
Don't do that, honey.

1177
01:05:43,398 --> 01:05:46,859
You have to talk to her in a Ianguage
that she understand.

1178
01:05:46,943 --> 01:05:49,653
You got to Iearn
how to start speaking your damn mind.

1179
01:05:49,737 --> 01:05:50,821
I speak my mind.

1180
01:05:50,905 --> 01:05:54,074
I didn't say, "Speak your mind,"
I said, "Speak your damn mind."

1181
01:05:54,159 --> 01:05:56,285
If somebody do something
you don't Iike, you say,

1182
01:05:56,369 --> 01:05:57,995
"Hey, what the hell is wrong with you?

1183
01:05:58,079 --> 01:06:00,372
"You better get your ass together.
This is some straight up bull.

1184
01:06:00,456 --> 01:06:03,458
"Hell, what is wrong with you?
You heard me? Hell."

1185
01:06:04,127 --> 01:06:06,295
That's what you got
to say to them sometime.

1186
01:06:06,963 --> 01:06:08,630
- Okay. I will.
- Think about that.

1187
01:06:08,715 --> 01:06:10,465
It'll make you feel better.
You'll feel so Iiberated.

1188
01:06:10,550 --> 01:06:13,510
You're around here doing all that yoda.
Honey, you ain't got to do all that yoda.

1189
01:06:13,595 --> 01:06:15,137
You ain't got to do not one more yoda.

1190
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:17,014
I'm gonna try that next time.

1191
01:06:17,098 --> 01:06:18,640
Good. I just gave you some great advice.

1192
01:06:18,725 --> 01:06:20,058
You gave me some good advice.

1193
01:06:20,143 --> 01:06:21,351
I'm gonna give you some better advice.

1194
01:06:21,436 --> 01:06:22,477
White folks ain't supposed to be out here

1195
01:06:22,562 --> 01:06:24,146
on this porch
in the middle of the night, honey.

1196
01:06:24,230 --> 01:06:25,230
Okay.

1197
01:06:25,315 --> 01:06:27,357
Yep. Nope, come on,
Iet's go on in the house.

1198
01:06:27,442 --> 01:06:29,234
- Thank you.
- Yeah, you go on first.

1199
01:06:31,654 --> 01:06:33,405
Any luck?

1200
01:06:34,199 --> 01:06:35,699
No, none.

1201
01:06:37,118 --> 01:06:38,160
George.

1202
01:06:38,244 --> 01:06:42,456
Yeah, I know what you're going to say.
You don't think I'm trying.

1203
01:06:43,291 --> 01:06:45,417
Look at this charity, right here.

1204
01:06:46,002 --> 01:06:48,879
Okay. I don't really have to Iook at it.

1205
01:06:48,963 --> 01:06:51,673
Hear me out.
Listen to what I'm saying to you.

1206
01:06:51,758 --> 01:06:53,800
These guys dig wells in Africa.

1207
01:06:54,385 --> 01:06:56,428
This one, breast cancer.

1208
01:06:56,512 --> 01:07:00,974
This one,
they stop sex trafficking of children. Okay?

1209
01:07:01,059 --> 01:07:03,477
This one, AIDS research. This one, cancer.

1210
01:07:03,561 --> 01:07:05,604
This homeless shelter
is gonna have to close.

1211
01:07:05,688 --> 01:07:08,649
George, you got to help me
help these people.

1212
01:07:16,199 --> 01:07:20,744
Brian, I'm eight years away from retiring,

1213
01:07:21,955 --> 01:07:24,164
and now I'm facing jail.

1214
01:07:24,666 --> 01:07:26,959
And all these people were hurt

1215
01:07:27,835 --> 01:07:30,379
because I wasn't paying attention.

1216
01:07:32,799 --> 01:07:35,050
And I was Iooking forward to retiring.

1217
01:07:37,053 --> 01:07:39,096
Spending time with my son.

1218
01:07:40,515 --> 01:07:44,559
Getting great, big bear hugs
after a good game of catch, you know?

1219
01:07:45,812 --> 01:07:47,354
Seeing my daughter happy,

1220
01:07:48,773 --> 01:07:50,023
content.

1221
01:07:52,068 --> 01:07:55,654
I just wanted to Iive happily ever after
with my family.

1222
01:07:56,864 --> 01:08:01,118
And now, my family's falling apart.

1223
01:08:01,661 --> 01:08:05,580
So maybe I deserve all of this, okay?

1224
01:08:05,665 --> 01:08:09,001
'Cause I can't believe
what's happening to me.

1225
01:08:09,085 --> 01:08:11,795
How could I not see this coming?

1226
01:08:11,879 --> 01:08:16,550
George, you couldn't see it
because you weren't paying attention.

1227
01:08:16,634 --> 01:08:18,510
But now your eyes are wide open.

1228
01:08:20,722 --> 01:08:23,307
But none of this makes sense to me.

1229
01:08:23,391 --> 01:08:27,311
I mean, I see accounts here and they all start
with a Ietter of the alphabet.

1230
01:08:27,395 --> 01:08:32,441
"A," "P," "U," "J," "K," "R," "I."

1231
01:08:32,900 --> 01:08:36,153
We never use the alphabet
to start accounts, Brian.

1232
01:08:36,237 --> 01:08:39,656
I don't know what I'm Iooking at here.
I really don't.

1233
01:08:41,909 --> 01:08:45,662
You can't just keep Ietting people
walk all over you.

1234
01:08:46,497 --> 01:08:50,292
You were a mark. They set you up.
They thought you were weak.

1235
01:08:51,502 --> 01:08:53,754
They did this on purpose to you.

1236
01:08:53,838 --> 01:08:55,380
Are you just gonna Iay down
and Iet that happen,

1237
01:08:55,465 --> 01:08:56,965
or are you gonna claim your Iife back?

1238
01:08:57,050 --> 01:08:59,926
Prove them wrong.
Hit them right between the eyes.

1239
01:09:00,928 --> 01:09:05,265
You're stronger than this.
There is a fighter in you, George.

1240
01:09:06,392 --> 01:09:09,019
Show them. Show me.

1241
01:09:09,103 --> 01:09:13,023
You can work this out, okay?
Just don't give up.

1242
01:09:15,651 --> 01:09:17,319
Shall we keep digging?

1243
01:09:17,403 --> 01:09:19,112
- Okay.
- Okay.

1244
01:09:19,197 --> 01:09:20,906
- Okay.
- AII right.

1245
01:09:21,366 --> 01:09:22,657
Watch your step.

1246
01:09:25,912 --> 01:09:27,371
Take care now.

1247
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:34,086
How was school?

1248
01:09:34,170 --> 01:09:36,004
I mean, you know, it's school.

1249
01:09:36,130 --> 01:09:37,506
School is school, yeah.

1250
01:09:37,590 --> 01:09:39,049
What you got there?

1251
01:09:39,133 --> 01:09:41,009
- Baseball.
- Baseball.

1252
01:09:41,094 --> 01:09:42,135
You play?

1253
01:09:42,428 --> 01:09:45,055
Yeah, but not very good.

1254
01:09:45,139 --> 01:09:46,515
Really?

1255
01:09:46,891 --> 01:09:48,642
Well, Iet me see, son. You can't be that bad.

1256
01:09:48,726 --> 01:09:50,227
- What position do you play?
- Pitcher.

1257
01:09:50,311 --> 01:09:51,645
Okay. Well, I used to play catcher.

1258
01:09:51,729 --> 01:09:53,605
So, you go on over there
and I want you to throw it to me.

1259
01:09:53,689 --> 01:09:54,815
- AII right.
- I want you to throw it to me

1260
01:09:54,899 --> 01:09:55,982
as hard as you can.

1261
01:09:56,776 --> 01:09:58,693
- Throw it at me.
- AII right.

1262
01:09:58,778 --> 01:10:00,320
Here we go. Put it. Put it right here.

1263
01:10:00,405 --> 01:10:02,948
- Put it right in the middle.
- Right here, right here.

1264
01:10:06,994 --> 01:10:08,620
Yeah, you... Yeah.

1265
01:10:08,704 --> 01:10:10,747
- Yeah, you suck.
- Sorry, I...

1266
01:10:11,749 --> 01:10:13,667
Come here, son.

1267
01:10:15,086 --> 01:10:16,378
That's all right, son.

1268
01:10:16,462 --> 01:10:19,714
Maybe you ain't supposed to be a pitcher.
Everybody ain't supposed to be a pitcher.

1269
01:10:19,799 --> 01:10:21,842
You know, you got to get in where you fit in.

1270
01:10:21,926 --> 01:10:23,552
You know, I never thought about it that way.

1271
01:10:23,636 --> 01:10:24,928
But Iisten, son. I'm gonna help you.

1272
01:10:25,012 --> 01:10:28,014
I'm gonna teach you how to pitch
and to catch,

1273
01:10:28,099 --> 01:10:30,100
because we family, we family.

1274
01:10:30,476 --> 01:10:32,060
- We are?
- Yeah.

1275
01:10:32,145 --> 01:10:35,689
Yeah. It's a Iong story. It's a Iong story.

1276
01:10:35,773 --> 01:10:37,315
I used to be in the Negro League.

1277
01:10:38,568 --> 01:10:40,610
- Negro...
- The Negro League, son.

1278
01:10:40,695 --> 01:10:44,072
Boy, somebody got to teach you
about your heritage.

1279
01:10:44,157 --> 01:10:50,787
The Negro Leagues is when
colored baseball players couldn't play...

1280
01:10:51,622 --> 01:10:53,623
Colored, Iike Negro, Iike me and you.

1281
01:10:53,708 --> 01:10:58,253
They couldn't play professional baseball,
so they came up with their own Ieague.

1282
01:10:58,337 --> 01:10:59,880
Satchel Paige and I played.

1283
01:10:59,964 --> 01:11:03,800
I was a catcher,
so I'm gonna show you how to be a catcher.

1284
01:11:03,885 --> 01:11:05,218
- AII right. AII right.
- AII right?

1285
01:11:05,303 --> 01:11:07,345
Step on back there.
I'm gonna show you how to catch this.

1286
01:11:07,472 --> 01:11:09,055
- I'm gonna throw it to you one good time.
- AII right.

1287
01:11:09,140 --> 01:11:11,641
- I want you to concentrate real hard.
- AII right.

1288
01:11:13,644 --> 01:11:16,313
Almost. AII right, try it.
Right here, right here.

1289
01:11:16,564 --> 01:11:17,856
There we go. See that?

1290
01:11:18,191 --> 01:11:20,066
- I've had it.
- I don't care.

1291
01:11:20,151 --> 01:11:21,151
Change your attitude.

1292
01:11:21,235 --> 01:11:22,652
- Hello, son.
- Hi, Mom.

1293
01:11:22,737 --> 01:11:24,654
- Your poor father...
- My father does not need...

1294
01:11:24,739 --> 01:11:27,991
Were you with your brother today?
AII day today, again?

1295
01:11:28,826 --> 01:11:32,037
No, Mom, I was with Brian.

1296
01:11:32,163 --> 01:11:34,331
I don't have a brother, remember?

1297
01:11:34,874 --> 01:11:36,416
This is all an act!

1298
01:11:36,501 --> 01:11:37,501
Right.

1299
01:11:37,585 --> 01:11:38,627
I am not being disrespectful!

1300
01:11:38,711 --> 01:11:41,254
You're being so fake!
You're not my mom!

1301
01:11:41,339 --> 01:11:42,672
- ...your attitude.
- You're making it no better.

1302
01:11:42,757 --> 01:11:43,757
Get upstairs!

1303
01:11:43,841 --> 01:11:46,551
I want to go home. I hate it here.

1304
01:11:47,011 --> 01:11:48,261
- Hi.
- Hi.

1305
01:11:48,721 --> 01:11:50,847
George, I can't do this anymore.

1306
01:11:50,932 --> 01:11:52,849
- That daughter is so disrespectful.
- I know.

1307
01:11:52,934 --> 01:11:56,770
I'm gonna do all I can
to help us get our Iife back.

1308
01:11:56,854 --> 01:11:59,022
I don't want our Iife back.

1309
01:11:59,941 --> 01:12:01,358
I want a new Iife.

1310
01:12:01,442 --> 01:12:04,528
One where you're in it.
One where we're all happy.

1311
01:12:04,612 --> 01:12:08,406
I don't know, afternoon Iunches and sex!

1312
01:12:08,533 --> 01:12:10,242
I want sex, George!

1313
01:12:10,868 --> 01:12:12,410
Should I be Iistening to this?

1314
01:12:12,537 --> 01:12:13,745
- No!
- No!

1315
01:12:15,289 --> 01:12:18,083
Kate, I'm sorry.

1316
01:12:18,584 --> 01:12:21,753
Stop saying sorry and get mad.

1317
01:12:21,879 --> 01:12:23,922
- I am mad.
- You're not mad.

1318
01:12:24,048 --> 01:12:26,174
I'm extremely mad.

1319
01:12:26,259 --> 01:12:27,884
Extremely mad, George?

1320
01:12:30,054 --> 01:12:31,346
You don't think I'm mad?

1321
01:12:31,430 --> 01:12:32,889
I don't think you're mad.

1322
01:12:35,393 --> 01:12:38,979
This is getting me so mad, this whole thing.

1323
01:12:39,063 --> 01:12:40,188
That's mad.

1324
01:12:40,273 --> 01:12:42,899
You're not extremely mad!
You need to get damn mad!

1325
01:12:43,442 --> 01:12:44,568
What?

1326
01:12:45,653 --> 01:12:47,904
I'm just speaking my damn mind, okay?

1327
01:12:47,989 --> 01:12:50,907
Hell! This is some straight up bull.

1328
01:12:51,325 --> 01:12:55,370
Hell, get your ass together. You heard me?

1329
01:12:55,454 --> 01:12:56,746
Hell!

1330
01:13:02,503 --> 01:13:04,296
I've got to get us out of here.

1331
01:13:07,258 --> 01:13:08,925
Just spill it. We gotta have it all.

1332
01:13:09,427 --> 01:13:12,178
Because if you don't, then you're
going to jail for the rest of your Iife.

1333
01:13:15,266 --> 01:13:17,142
Ever since we got here,
I don't care anymore.

1334
01:13:17,685 --> 01:13:19,352
Do you know what? I don't care.
You...

1335
01:13:34,660 --> 01:13:36,953
- Hi, honey.
- Hi. What are you doing?

1336
01:13:50,301 --> 01:13:53,386
- Good one. Good one, Howie.
- Thanks.

1337
01:13:54,805 --> 01:13:55,805
You got it.

1338
01:14:13,532 --> 01:14:18,036
Amazing Grace...

1339
01:14:19,789 --> 01:14:21,665
How was school today?

1340
01:14:21,791 --> 01:14:24,626
About the same
as when you were raised by Moses.

1341
01:14:25,044 --> 01:14:26,294
Where's my dad?

1342
01:14:26,379 --> 01:14:28,213
I can't stand you.

1343
01:14:30,383 --> 01:14:33,843
I got something to tell you, honey.
It's awfully bad news.

1344
01:14:34,303 --> 01:14:35,887
Precious Lord...

1345
01:14:36,013 --> 01:14:37,222
What?

1346
01:14:40,309 --> 01:14:41,893
Your daddy died.

1347
01:14:43,854 --> 01:14:44,979
What?

1348
01:14:45,064 --> 01:14:46,189
He died.

1349
01:14:47,525 --> 01:14:51,528
Them people that were Iooking for him,
they came here and they got him.

1350
01:14:52,905 --> 01:14:54,698
And they brought him out there
to the highway,

1351
01:14:54,824 --> 01:14:59,452
and they was painting them stripes
on the stone highway, and he tried to run,

1352
01:14:59,537 --> 01:15:02,831
and one of them stripe machine
put a Iine right down the middle of him.

1353
01:15:02,915 --> 01:15:06,209
Then the people that was coming
didn't know if it was a passing Iane

1354
01:15:06,335 --> 01:15:08,878
or high-occupancy vehicle Iane.

1355
01:15:09,004 --> 01:15:10,588
Everybody got confused
and they had a wreck,

1356
01:15:10,715 --> 01:15:11,881
and they just ran all over...

1357
01:15:12,007 --> 01:15:15,051
About 5,700 cars piled up on top of him.

1358
01:15:15,720 --> 01:15:19,472
And Kate, she didn't know what to do,
so she went to running.

1359
01:15:19,557 --> 01:15:23,226
She just started running as fast as she can.
Was running Iike Wonder Woman.

1360
01:15:23,352 --> 01:15:26,855
But they had a helichopter
and that helichopter got closer...

1361
01:15:26,939 --> 01:15:28,189
And that was it.

1362
01:15:28,399 --> 01:15:30,024
No! Kate, too?

1363
01:15:30,568 --> 01:15:32,360
Kate, too. Kate, too.

1364
01:15:32,445 --> 01:15:34,487
And that helichopter was spinning
and them blades...

1365
01:15:34,572 --> 01:15:37,532
Where's Howie? Where's Howie?

1366
01:15:38,909 --> 01:15:41,161
Oh, Lord. Poor Howie.
You know, he tried to run,

1367
01:15:41,245 --> 01:15:44,414
but he always have them candy bars
and soda pops in his pockets,

1368
01:15:44,540 --> 01:15:47,459
so he kept dropping things and he tripped.

1369
01:15:47,585 --> 01:15:49,794
So they put them cement shoes on him
and they throwed him in,

1370
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:51,087
and he's swimming with the fishes.

1371
01:15:51,213 --> 01:15:52,255
Oh, my God!

1372
01:15:53,132 --> 01:15:55,884
My God! I can't believe this is happening.

1373
01:15:55,968 --> 01:15:57,927
Why you so upset?

1374
01:15:58,053 --> 01:15:59,387
What do you mean?

1375
01:15:59,472 --> 01:16:03,057
Well, you always say, "I hate you. You suck.
Shut up. I hate you."

1376
01:16:03,142 --> 01:16:06,478
I didn't mean anything that I've said before.

1377
01:16:06,604 --> 01:16:07,854
It's too Iate now, honey.

1378
01:16:07,938 --> 01:16:11,274
It's all right. They gone. Dead. Just done.

1379
01:16:11,984 --> 01:16:13,234
They gone.

1380
01:16:13,319 --> 01:16:16,988
So, the people at Child Welfare asked me
if I would take you,

1381
01:16:17,114 --> 01:16:18,865
so I said you can stay here till you're 18,
but you...

1382
01:16:18,949 --> 01:16:21,159
No! No, no! No!

1383
01:16:21,285 --> 01:16:23,620
I got an EBT card, what you worried about?

1384
01:16:23,746 --> 01:16:24,788
- Dad!
- Honey.

1385
01:16:25,414 --> 01:16:27,457
Cindy, what's wrong?

1386
01:16:27,583 --> 01:16:29,459
She told me you died.

1387
01:16:29,668 --> 01:16:30,668
What?

1388
01:16:31,295 --> 01:16:33,838
Madea, why would you tell her that?

1389
01:16:33,964 --> 01:16:35,256
Look, this is why I tell her that.

1390
01:16:35,341 --> 01:16:38,134
'Cause she's sitting around here mad
at everybody and being all nasty and mean.

1391
01:16:38,260 --> 01:16:41,638
Your parents could be gone at any minute,
then you'll be stuck with somebody Iike me.

1392
01:16:41,764 --> 01:16:44,057
Is that what you want?
To stay here in this hellhole?

1393
01:16:44,141 --> 01:16:45,183
I'm sorry.

1394
01:16:45,309 --> 01:16:47,602
Start acting Iike you're sorry, then.

1395
01:16:47,686 --> 01:16:49,604
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Howie.

1396
01:16:49,688 --> 01:16:51,189
It's all right. It's all right, Cindy.

1397
01:16:51,315 --> 01:16:54,317
Now, Iook at her, all broke up,
acting Iike she's sad and hurt.

1398
01:16:56,362 --> 01:16:58,279
Okay, honey. It's okay.

1399
01:16:58,364 --> 01:17:01,199
Madea, that was really cruel.

1400
01:17:01,325 --> 01:17:04,452
George? Shut the hell up.

1401
01:17:04,995 --> 01:17:06,830
It worked, didn't it?

1402
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:11,417
- Dad?
- Yeah, son.

1403
01:17:11,502 --> 01:17:12,585
There's something I need to tell you.

1404
01:17:12,670 --> 01:17:16,214
It'll have to wait till Iater.
I got to start the service right now.

1405
01:17:21,595 --> 01:17:22,804
Negros.

1406
01:17:27,351 --> 01:17:28,935
What the hell did you just say?

1407
01:17:29,228 --> 01:17:31,312
- Negros.
- Barbara!

1408
01:17:31,397 --> 01:17:32,605
Mom,

1409
01:17:32,982 --> 01:17:38,027
why don't we step out onto the porch
and get some air?

1410
01:17:38,112 --> 01:17:40,071
- Negros.
- Grams.

1411
01:17:40,155 --> 01:17:43,074
I hear Negros from my room.

1412
01:17:43,158 --> 01:17:46,536
I believe they're called
African-Americans now, Grandma.

1413
01:17:46,620 --> 01:17:48,621
Did that child just say "they"?

1414
01:17:48,706 --> 01:17:50,415
No, "we."

1415
01:17:50,499 --> 01:17:54,127
So beautiful. I hear them from my room.

1416
01:17:54,211 --> 01:17:55,420
- Okay.
- What's going on?

1417
01:17:55,504 --> 01:17:59,048
My baby mama just went Ieft, Mabel.
She just went Ieft.

1418
01:17:59,133 --> 01:18:00,258
Went Ieft?

1419
01:18:00,342 --> 01:18:01,801
I hear...

1420
01:18:02,678 --> 01:18:06,806
I hear them from my room.
I hear Negros from my room.

1421
01:18:06,891 --> 01:18:10,226
Well, I see dead people,
but I keep that to myself.

1422
01:18:10,561 --> 01:18:11,936
Tell them, Sadie.

1423
01:18:12,021 --> 01:18:13,396
Who the hell is Sadie?

1424
01:18:14,064 --> 01:18:15,315
Shut up.

1425
01:18:15,816 --> 01:18:18,693
Madea, honey. She right, she hear Negros.

1426
01:18:21,363 --> 01:18:24,073
It's bad enough that she's slipping.

1427
01:18:24,158 --> 01:18:25,742
Please don't encourage her.

1428
01:18:25,826 --> 01:18:28,578
No, she do hear Negros.

1429
01:18:28,662 --> 01:18:30,121
The whole bunch of them.

1430
01:18:30,706 --> 01:18:33,750
She hears a bunch of Negros?

1431
01:18:35,502 --> 01:18:37,545
Yes, everybody Iisten. Everybody be quiet.

1432
01:18:39,965 --> 01:18:41,382
Spirituals.

1433
01:18:41,467 --> 01:18:44,177
That's it. That's what she's trying to say,
Negro spirituals.

1434
01:18:44,261 --> 01:18:46,471
There's a church down on the corner.

1435
01:18:46,555 --> 01:18:48,973
They sing Negro spirituals on Sundays.

1436
01:18:49,058 --> 01:18:50,975
Why y'all so uptight?

1437
01:18:52,394 --> 01:18:55,939
Son, will you take me to the Negros?

1438
01:18:56,023 --> 01:18:58,358
- Take you to the Negro spiritual, honey.
- Spiritual.

1439
01:18:58,442 --> 01:19:00,902
Right. You can't just say "Negros."
Them days has passed.

1440
01:19:00,986 --> 01:19:02,904
First we were "Negros,"
then we was "colored,"

1441
01:19:02,988 --> 01:19:05,490
then we were "black,"
now we "African-American."

1442
01:19:05,574 --> 01:19:08,701
Okay? African-Americans.
Now singing old Negro spirituals.

1443
01:19:08,786 --> 01:19:09,953
- Spirituals.
- Negro spirituals.

1444
01:19:10,037 --> 01:19:13,373
- Spirituals. Spirituals. Okay.
- Yes, Mom. Yes, yes.

1445
01:19:13,457 --> 01:19:14,791
Yes, Iet's go.

1446
01:19:15,209 --> 01:19:18,586
Let's go down to the church.

1447
01:19:18,671 --> 01:19:19,712
Is it safe?

1448
01:19:20,089 --> 01:19:21,297
What you mean, "Is it safe," George?

1449
01:19:21,382 --> 01:19:24,050
What they gonna do,
stone you with a Bible? It's a church.

1450
01:20:09,847 --> 01:20:11,222
Pretty good.

1451
01:20:22,901 --> 01:20:24,819
Can I get an "amen" for our choir?

1452
01:20:24,903 --> 01:20:26,237
Amen!

1453
01:20:26,363 --> 01:20:27,780
AII right, well done.

1454
01:20:28,365 --> 01:20:29,741
Well done.

1455
01:20:31,035 --> 01:20:32,035
Praise the Lord.

1456
01:20:32,119 --> 01:20:33,953
Praise the Lord!

1457
01:20:36,248 --> 01:20:40,960
Praise the Lord. I am so happy, so happy
to be back in the House of the Lord

1458
01:20:42,463 --> 01:20:44,714
where mercy can be found.

1459
01:20:45,716 --> 01:20:50,178
As most of you know, I have
been very sick these past few months.

1460
01:20:50,262 --> 01:20:53,765
But by the grace of God, I've recovered.
But I have to tell you something.

1461
01:20:55,142 --> 01:20:59,562
I've given a Iot of prayer
and I feel it's time for me to retire.

1462
01:21:01,231 --> 01:21:03,149
Now don't y'all worry, don't worry.

1463
01:21:03,233 --> 01:21:06,486
This church will continue,
and its future's guaranteed,

1464
01:21:06,570 --> 01:21:09,405
because the church has been paid off.

1465
01:21:11,658 --> 01:21:16,621
Praise God!

1466
01:21:16,747 --> 01:21:17,997
Oh, no.

1467
01:21:22,002 --> 01:21:26,839
And I was able to pay the church off
because of the investments of my son.

1468
01:21:27,758 --> 01:21:28,966
My son.

1469
01:21:29,927 --> 01:21:31,344
I'm so proud of him.

1470
01:21:31,428 --> 01:21:34,305
Son, come on up here
and tell them what you've done.

1471
01:21:34,431 --> 01:21:37,934
Let us praise Jesus
'cause we're all precious in His name.

1472
01:21:38,018 --> 01:21:39,435
Precious.

1473
01:21:41,772 --> 01:21:43,106
Precious?

1474
01:21:44,108 --> 01:21:45,441
- To all the congregation here...
- Precious.

1475
01:21:46,944 --> 01:21:48,861
...there's something I need to tell you.

1476
01:21:49,279 --> 01:21:50,696
I did invest the money...

1477
01:21:50,781 --> 01:21:54,826
Precious!

1478
01:21:54,952 --> 01:21:56,369
Somebody's got the Holy Ghost.

1479
01:21:57,454 --> 01:22:01,541
I know!

1480
01:22:02,501 --> 01:22:04,961
- You know?
- I know!

1481
01:22:05,045 --> 01:22:07,004
The same know that I know?

1482
01:22:07,131 --> 01:22:08,589
I know!

1483
01:22:08,674 --> 01:22:09,757
That man knows!

1484
01:22:09,842 --> 01:22:11,676
- You know?
- I know!

1485
01:22:11,802 --> 01:22:15,012
- How much do you know?
- Do you think that he knows now?

1486
01:22:15,139 --> 01:22:16,973
- I'm not hot, I just know.
- Praise the Lord!

1487
01:22:17,057 --> 01:22:18,307
Yes!

1488
01:22:18,392 --> 01:22:20,184
AII right, George, you want to try
to explain this to me?

1489
01:22:20,310 --> 01:22:21,394
Yeah.

1490
01:22:21,478 --> 01:22:23,563
There was a woman
named Precious Jackson

1491
01:22:23,647 --> 01:22:25,565
that Walter always told me about. Okay?

1492
01:22:25,649 --> 01:22:28,526
Now I've Iooked at these accounts
and they all start with a Ietter.

1493
01:22:28,652 --> 01:22:31,320
The Ietters spell out "Precious Jackson."

1494
01:22:31,989 --> 01:22:34,240
It's all encrypted, right here.

1495
01:22:34,324 --> 01:22:36,659
What the hell are you talking about?

1496
01:22:37,202 --> 01:22:38,828
The Ietters spell out...

1497
01:22:38,912 --> 01:22:40,454
Okay, I'm a Iittle confused
by this, too.

1498
01:22:40,539 --> 01:22:42,832
It's the name the account is in.

1499
01:22:43,375 --> 01:22:44,458
Okay.

1500
01:22:44,543 --> 01:22:47,753
Just follow this, 'cause it took some doing

1501
01:22:47,838 --> 01:22:50,673
to follow the money trail
from the Cayman Islands and Germany.

1502
01:22:50,757 --> 01:22:56,220
But the trail goes cold when the money
goes into a Swiss account. Okay?

1503
01:22:56,346 --> 01:23:00,183
Now, they were all given a Ietter
when they went in and came out.

1504
01:23:00,851 --> 01:23:02,059
- Right?
- Okay.

1505
01:23:02,186 --> 01:23:05,938
But every month on this date,

1506
01:23:06,023 --> 01:23:09,400
as the funds go into this Swiss account,

1507
01:23:09,526 --> 01:23:12,486
this account in the US sees a deposit.

1508
01:23:12,571 --> 01:23:16,324
Now I balance the two, and it's exactly 10 %

1509
01:23:16,408 --> 01:23:20,328
that resurfaces in the US
in this account every month

1510
01:23:20,412 --> 01:23:23,080
to a Iady named Precious Jackson.

1511
01:23:23,540 --> 01:23:25,458
What is 10 % gonna do?

1512
01:23:25,542 --> 01:23:28,085
Of 600 million?

1513
01:23:28,170 --> 01:23:30,796
That's six million!

1514
01:23:30,881 --> 01:23:32,006
Jake.

1515
01:23:34,843 --> 01:23:36,886
It's 60 million.

1516
01:23:36,970 --> 01:23:38,721
- Sixty.
- Sixty.

1517
01:23:38,805 --> 01:23:40,806
George.

1518
01:23:40,891 --> 01:23:42,475
I can get the church's money back.

1519
01:23:42,893 --> 01:23:45,686
- Praise God.
- Yes, you and all the charities.

1520
01:23:45,771 --> 01:23:47,855
- Can this really work?
- Yes, it can work.

1521
01:23:47,940 --> 01:23:49,315
Why would Walter take this money

1522
01:23:49,399 --> 01:23:52,235
and put it in an account with
some woman's name who never touches it?

1523
01:23:52,611 --> 01:23:56,614
Well, either he didn't tell her about it,
or she doesn't exist.

1524
01:23:56,698 --> 01:24:00,117
So what I'll do is I'll get a federal warrant,

1525
01:24:00,202 --> 01:24:01,744
we'll get the account seized.

1526
01:24:01,828 --> 01:24:04,789
I'm pretty sure once I bring this to the judge,
you'll be able to get probation.

1527
01:24:04,873 --> 01:24:05,915
That's a great job.

1528
01:24:05,999 --> 01:24:09,210
But, Brian, we can get this money
back to the people it belongs to.

1529
01:24:09,294 --> 01:24:11,295
It's sitting right here in this account.

1530
01:24:11,380 --> 01:24:13,589
You didn't just say that to me.
I'm an officer of the court.

1531
01:24:13,674 --> 01:24:15,675
I don't even know what you're thinking.
I didn't hear that.

1532
01:24:15,759 --> 01:24:18,177
I don't even want to know
what you're thinking. No. No, no, no.

1533
01:24:18,262 --> 01:24:19,762
- Brian.
- Not having this conversation.

1534
01:24:19,846 --> 01:24:21,264
- I'm out of here.
- Please. Come on.

1535
01:24:21,348 --> 01:24:22,974
- I will see you at the office tomorrow...
- Brian.

1536
01:24:23,058 --> 01:24:24,058
...bright and early, George.

1537
01:24:24,142 --> 01:24:25,434
- Thank you so much.
- Brian. Please.

1538
01:24:25,519 --> 01:24:26,560
Bye.

1539
01:24:28,438 --> 01:24:31,107
I've come too close to give up now, okay?
I'm not calling it quits.

1540
01:24:31,191 --> 01:24:33,859
I'm gonna get that money
back to the charities.

1541
01:24:34,945 --> 01:24:36,988
Right? I want my Iife back.

1542
01:24:37,781 --> 01:24:40,408
And here is where I start to take action.

1543
01:24:40,492 --> 01:24:44,662
So you're either with me or you're not,
but I'm not giving up without a fight.

1544
01:24:44,788 --> 01:24:48,749
So what's it gonna be,
Mr. I'm-a-tough-guy-from-the-hood?

1545
01:24:48,834 --> 01:24:51,752
Mr. You-going-down-homie?

1546
01:24:51,837 --> 01:24:55,089
'Cause I'll tell you,
I'm gonna do the damn thing.

1547
01:24:55,173 --> 01:24:56,966
So you're with me or what?

1548
01:24:57,968 --> 01:24:59,093
I'm with you.

1549
01:24:59,177 --> 01:25:01,304
- Gucci!
- Yeah.

1550
01:25:03,223 --> 01:25:04,307
With you.

1551
01:25:10,147 --> 01:25:11,397
You okay?

1552
01:25:12,482 --> 01:25:13,566
I will be.

1553
01:25:14,026 --> 01:25:16,527
George, what's going on?

1554
01:25:16,653 --> 01:25:19,238
I screwed up, that's what's going on.

1555
01:25:19,323 --> 01:25:21,866
And now there's a big wrong
that I have to right.

1556
01:25:21,992 --> 01:25:26,245
And I just have to figure out
how I'm gonna do it.

1557
01:25:26,330 --> 01:25:28,664
But I'm gonna do it. I am gonna do it.

1558
01:25:29,666 --> 01:25:32,918
George, I haven't seen this much fire in you
since we got married.

1559
01:25:33,170 --> 01:25:35,671
Well, maybe it's Iong overdue, huh?

1560
01:25:37,090 --> 01:25:40,176
Do you remember
our honeymoon in Florence?

1561
01:25:41,386 --> 01:25:44,180
- I remember it rained every day.
- It did.

1562
01:25:44,598 --> 01:25:46,015
And do you remember, you said,

1563
01:25:46,099 --> 01:25:49,185
"What if our marriage is
nothing but full of rainy days?"

1564
01:25:49,269 --> 01:25:51,354
I might have been joking.

1565
01:25:51,897 --> 01:25:54,273
But I remember
you still got upset, didn't you?

1566
01:25:54,358 --> 01:25:55,941
- I did.
- Yeah.

1567
01:25:56,026 --> 01:25:57,234
And what did you say?

1568
01:25:57,944 --> 01:25:59,862
I said,

1569
01:25:59,946 --> 01:26:03,240
"Rain does make things grow."

1570
01:26:03,367 --> 01:26:05,117
Exactly.

1571
01:26:05,202 --> 01:26:08,329
What if all this happened for a reason?

1572
01:26:08,413 --> 01:26:10,373
For you and I
to get to know each other again,

1573
01:26:10,457 --> 01:26:13,793
for our family to get closer, for us to grow?

1574
01:26:15,212 --> 01:26:16,796
What if it did?

1575
01:26:17,881 --> 01:26:20,633
Kate, you are amazing.

1576
01:26:21,885 --> 01:26:24,136
I swear to you, I'm gonna make things right.

1577
01:26:24,221 --> 01:26:26,847
I have no doubt.

1578
01:26:26,932 --> 01:26:29,016
Honey, you always do the right thing.

1579
01:26:29,101 --> 01:26:30,726
I Iove you so much.

1580
01:26:30,811 --> 01:26:32,561
I Iove you, too.

1581
01:26:34,231 --> 01:26:36,107
I'm so proud of you, George.

1582
01:26:38,151 --> 01:26:39,443
That's good.

1583
01:26:39,569 --> 01:26:41,070
I'm closing an account.

1584
01:26:41,321 --> 01:26:46,075
Rita, it looks like you'll be
withdrawing $4 million from us today.

1585
01:26:46,159 --> 01:26:47,243
$4 million?

1586
01:26:47,327 --> 01:26:49,286
- Is that correct?
- Yes.

1587
01:26:49,830 --> 01:26:51,664
Well, how would you like that?

1588
01:26:52,416 --> 01:26:53,499
10s and 20s?

1589
01:26:53,917 --> 01:26:56,627
Hey, son. We watching Ghost.

1590
01:26:56,711 --> 01:26:59,255
She's gonna walk up in a bank
and act Iike she somebody else.

1591
01:26:59,339 --> 01:27:00,548
Look at that.

1592
01:27:00,632 --> 01:27:03,342
You know we require identification
and all that.

1593
01:27:03,427 --> 01:27:06,804
Rita Miller or Oda Mae Jones,
she don't even know what her name is.

1594
01:27:07,931 --> 01:27:10,808
Rita Miller. That's my name.

1595
01:27:11,268 --> 01:27:13,018
My name. Rita Miller.

1596
01:27:15,397 --> 01:27:16,897
My name.

1597
01:27:18,066 --> 01:27:19,692
The check.

1598
01:27:21,361 --> 01:27:22,403
Here you are.

1599
01:27:25,115 --> 01:27:27,992
What the hell you Iooking at me
Iike the Iast virgin for?

1600
01:27:32,831 --> 01:27:34,832
Now Iet me make sure I got this right.

1601
01:27:34,916 --> 01:27:37,334
Y'all want me to get on the aeroplane,

1602
01:27:37,419 --> 01:27:40,796
go out to New York City and go in a bank
and pretend to be Precious Jackson?

1603
01:27:42,090 --> 01:27:43,340
Is that right?

1604
01:27:43,425 --> 01:27:44,508
Yes.

1605
01:27:47,637 --> 01:27:49,513
Does Brian know anything about this?

1606
01:27:49,598 --> 01:27:52,099
- No.
- He thinks you both could go to jail.

1607
01:27:52,184 --> 01:27:54,268
Well, I could be going to jail anyway.

1608
01:27:54,352 --> 01:27:56,645
That's all right. Just don't drop the soap,
you'll be fine.

1609
01:27:56,730 --> 01:27:59,440
I been up in there. You might have to
fight a Iittle bit, kick a Iittle ass.

1610
01:27:59,524 --> 01:28:00,608
But you'll be all right.

1611
01:28:00,692 --> 01:28:02,693
If you don't kick no ass,
they gonna take your ass.

1612
01:28:02,777 --> 01:28:04,153
But you'll be all right.

1613
01:28:05,238 --> 01:28:07,114
I don't know about this, though.
I don't feel good about this.

1614
01:28:07,199 --> 01:28:08,908
I just don't... I don't know. I don't know.

1615
01:28:08,992 --> 01:28:11,076
Madea, it's easy.

1616
01:28:11,161 --> 01:28:13,829
It's just as easy as it was in the movie.

1617
01:28:14,664 --> 01:28:16,499
Whoopi Goldberg had a dead white man
helping her

1618
01:28:16,583 --> 01:28:18,125
all through that whole movie.

1619
01:28:18,210 --> 01:28:19,460
I'll help you.

1620
01:28:19,544 --> 01:28:21,670
You alive. I said dead!

1621
01:28:21,755 --> 01:28:23,047
George, you cannot go to New York.

1622
01:28:23,131 --> 01:28:24,215
Honey, I have to.

1623
01:28:24,299 --> 01:28:26,425
You can't. They're still after you.
Are you crazy?

1624
01:28:26,510 --> 01:28:28,302
I'll disguise myself somehow.

1625
01:28:28,386 --> 01:28:30,346
They won't know me. Okay? It'll be fine.

1626
01:28:30,430 --> 01:28:32,139
- No, I can't do that.
- Madea.

1627
01:28:32,224 --> 01:28:34,266
Please, I know you can do it.

1628
01:28:34,351 --> 01:28:36,393
You say this is for charity?

1629
01:28:36,520 --> 01:28:38,896
And for the church? Right, Jake?
For the church? It's for the church?

1630
01:28:39,022 --> 01:28:41,524
It's for the church, for your daddy
get the money back for the church?

1631
01:28:41,608 --> 01:28:44,568
AII right. Now my question then becomes,

1632
01:28:44,694 --> 01:28:47,655
all these beautiful people
that got these charities

1633
01:28:47,739 --> 01:28:50,699
and helping all these children
and feeding the people around the world,

1634
01:28:50,784 --> 01:28:53,911
it's for that, that's wonderful,
but I have a question for you.

1635
01:28:55,872 --> 01:28:57,957
What the hell in it for me?

1636
01:28:58,750 --> 01:29:02,044
Madea, you'll feel a Iot better about yourself.

1637
01:29:02,879 --> 01:29:06,382
I always feel good about myself.
Hell, I was born 6'2".

1638
01:29:06,883 --> 01:29:08,425
237 pounds.

1639
01:29:08,552 --> 01:29:12,137
I have always been this big all my Iife.
I went to kindergarten this big.

1640
01:29:12,305 --> 01:29:14,598
I had to have high self-esteem.
I feel good about myself.

1641
01:29:14,724 --> 01:29:16,934
Ain't nothing you gonna tell me
gonna make me feel good about myself.

1642
01:29:17,060 --> 01:29:18,978
You give me some money,
that'll make me feel good about myself.

1643
01:29:20,063 --> 01:29:21,355
Okay, you know what?

1644
01:29:21,439 --> 01:29:24,400
Can we figure that out after this is done?

1645
01:29:25,235 --> 01:29:27,403
George, have you ever hired a ho?

1646
01:29:30,282 --> 01:29:32,241
No. No.

1647
01:29:33,326 --> 01:29:35,369
She want her money first.
Do you understand?

1648
01:29:35,453 --> 01:29:36,787
I need to get some money first.

1649
01:29:36,913 --> 01:29:40,124
Don't perform no services
until the money's on the table.

1650
01:29:42,752 --> 01:29:45,838
You know what? I'll do it. I will do it.

1651
01:29:45,922 --> 01:29:47,381
AII I got to do is go in there

1652
01:29:47,465 --> 01:29:49,592
and give them a bunch of accounts
to transfer the money to?

1653
01:29:49,676 --> 01:29:50,926
- Yes.
- 12 accounts?

1654
01:29:51,011 --> 01:29:52,386
I just give them the information
to do the transfer?

1655
01:29:52,470 --> 01:29:53,721
That's it. That's all.

1656
01:29:53,805 --> 01:29:54,888
AII right, I'll do it.

1657
01:29:54,973 --> 01:29:58,267
Then I will gladly do it. So he just
gonna wire the money to the accounts?

1658
01:29:58,351 --> 01:30:00,644
- Yes.
- Okay, fine.

1659
01:30:00,770 --> 01:30:02,938
Come on, Iet's go. Where's my purse?
Y'all get my purse.

1660
01:30:03,023 --> 01:30:05,149
Joe, where's my purse?
We've got to go up to New York.

1661
01:30:05,275 --> 01:30:07,234
You know what? If you guys are gonna go,

1662
01:30:07,319 --> 01:30:09,403
she can't Iook Iike this,
she can't be wearing that.

1663
01:30:09,487 --> 01:30:10,946
- Right.
- What's wrong with what I got on?

1664
01:30:12,282 --> 01:30:15,576
This came from Aretha Franklin.
Aretha gave me this.

1665
01:30:15,660 --> 01:30:17,328
And y'all know Aretha can dress.

1666
01:30:17,454 --> 01:30:20,039
You've seen Aretha,
she makes fashion statements.

1667
01:30:20,123 --> 01:30:22,625
How about Barbara, Cindy and I
give you a makeover?

1668
01:30:25,629 --> 01:30:27,838
Introducing Precious Jackson.

1669
01:30:47,984 --> 01:30:49,151
Wow.

1670
01:30:51,196 --> 01:30:52,321
This might work.

1671
01:30:52,656 --> 01:30:55,949
No. I don't know what the hell
y'all are thinking.

1672
01:30:56,034 --> 01:30:58,661
You Iook Iike a big ass bottle
of Pepto-Bismol.

1673
01:31:16,221 --> 01:31:18,681
- Can I give you a hand, sir?
- Yes. The Iuggage.

1674
01:31:18,765 --> 01:31:20,182
The airport.

1675
01:31:20,266 --> 01:31:22,393
This bag. This way.

1676
01:31:22,519 --> 01:31:24,019
- Here we go?
- Yeah.

1677
01:31:24,104 --> 01:31:25,354
Okay.

1678
01:31:26,356 --> 01:31:27,523
Going to the airport.

1679
01:31:27,607 --> 01:31:29,441
- Right this way, ma'am.
- AII right, I'll follow you.

1680
01:31:29,526 --> 01:31:32,027
You ain't got to rush me,
I know where the hell I'm going.

1681
01:31:33,571 --> 01:31:35,197
The airport. A Iot of people here.

1682
01:31:35,699 --> 01:31:37,116
I'm nervous. I need to relax.

1683
01:31:37,200 --> 01:31:38,659
Well, there's nothing to be nervous about.

1684
01:31:38,743 --> 01:31:42,121
It's just Iike riding in a car,
except you're 30,000 feet higher.

1685
01:31:42,205 --> 01:31:44,832
Cars don't crash from 30,000 feet, George.

1686
01:31:44,916 --> 01:31:48,335
You need something to calm your nerves,
I got that old wee-wee.

1687
01:31:48,420 --> 01:31:50,045
Hey, what does that mean, drugs?

1688
01:31:50,130 --> 01:31:51,380
- Is that drugs?
- I know you ain't got no drugs.

1689
01:31:51,464 --> 01:31:52,548
- No drugs.
- If you got...

1690
01:31:52,632 --> 01:31:53,966
I'm gonna beat your ass
if you got them drugs.

1691
01:31:54,050 --> 01:31:55,134
You don't bring no drugs up in here.

1692
01:31:55,218 --> 01:31:57,052
- They got sniffing dogs up in here.
- No drugs.

1693
01:31:57,137 --> 01:31:59,638
Y'all go through.
I'm not going through with y'all.

1694
01:31:59,723 --> 01:32:01,974
I'm not going through.
Excuse me, y'all. Excuse me.

1695
01:32:02,058 --> 01:32:04,643
- I'm not going through with them at all.
- Madame, you are making a scene.

1696
01:32:04,728 --> 01:32:07,312
- Watch yourself. Watch yourself, here.
- That's a no, no.

1697
01:32:07,897 --> 01:32:11,900
Y'all go on.
I don't know them. I don't know them.

1698
01:32:12,402 --> 01:32:14,403
Hi. Hi. A Iittle scary.

1699
01:32:14,738 --> 01:32:17,072
When I'm finished doing,
this gonna be the bomb.

1700
01:32:17,407 --> 01:32:19,908
- Don't say "bomb." Don't say "bomb."
- What is the bomb?

1701
01:32:19,993 --> 01:32:22,244
- No, no, no.
- Don't say...

1702
01:32:22,328 --> 01:32:24,163
Hey, he don't want me saying "bomb."

1703
01:32:24,247 --> 01:32:25,414
Okay.

1704
01:32:27,459 --> 01:32:30,043
What do I do, just give him the ticket?

1705
01:32:30,128 --> 01:32:31,670
And show him my ID?

1706
01:32:31,755 --> 01:32:33,881
- Okay.
- That's the way.

1707
01:32:33,965 --> 01:32:35,966
Okay, that's me, and that's my ticket.

1708
01:32:36,092 --> 01:32:38,719
- That is the way.
- Okay, thank you so much.

1709
01:32:38,803 --> 01:32:40,637
AII right.

1710
01:32:40,764 --> 01:32:43,015
Now what y'all doing?

1711
01:32:43,099 --> 01:32:45,392
- What y'all doing?
- Taking off our shoes.

1712
01:32:45,477 --> 01:32:48,395
Take off your personal items
and put them in the tray.

1713
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:51,064
What they gonna do
with my personal items?

1714
01:32:51,149 --> 01:32:52,316
Baby, I can't take off my shoe.

1715
01:32:52,442 --> 01:32:54,651
Do you know how hard it is for
a woman my size to take off her shoes?

1716
01:32:54,778 --> 01:32:56,111
I'm supposed to take off my shoes?

1717
01:32:56,237 --> 01:32:57,404
Yes, ma'am.

1718
01:32:58,114 --> 01:33:00,908
What the hell do I need
to be taking my shoes off for?

1719
01:33:02,118 --> 01:33:04,369
Baby, when you're this big,
it's hard to take your shoes off.

1720
01:33:04,454 --> 01:33:05,454
That's all I'm saying.

1721
01:33:05,580 --> 01:33:08,582
Take them off, but I don't know who the hell
gonna help me put them back on.

1722
01:33:08,666 --> 01:33:10,793
Y'all so serious.

1723
01:33:15,173 --> 01:33:16,799
Watch that now.

1724
01:33:21,012 --> 01:33:22,095
There you go.

1725
01:33:22,597 --> 01:33:24,807
Oh, Lord. And you just
push it through there?

1726
01:33:25,141 --> 01:33:27,267
- Now what I do? What I do?
- Right this way.

1727
01:33:27,352 --> 01:33:28,560
Right this way.

1728
01:33:28,645 --> 01:33:31,104
Okay. I'm gonna come on
through this thing.

1729
01:33:33,942 --> 01:33:36,151
- What the hell is that?
- Just step over here, please, ma'am.

1730
01:33:36,277 --> 01:33:37,444
What was that?

1731
01:33:37,529 --> 01:33:38,862
Just step over here through the scanner.

1732
01:33:39,948 --> 01:33:41,365
- What'd you want me to do?
- Step through here, please.

1733
01:33:41,491 --> 01:33:44,159
- Okay, all right.
- Right through the scanner.

1734
01:33:44,285 --> 01:33:46,370
Now what am I supposed to do?
This ain't gonna drop me down?

1735
01:33:46,496 --> 01:33:48,539
Just go and put your feet
in the footsteps, please.

1736
01:33:49,123 --> 01:33:52,167
That's really wide. You want me to put
both my feet where these yellow feet?

1737
01:33:52,293 --> 01:33:53,502
- Yes, ma'am.
- That's really wide.

1738
01:33:53,628 --> 01:33:56,004
My Iegs ain't been open that wide
since I had my daughter.

1739
01:33:57,674 --> 01:34:00,300
George, they want me to spread my Iegs.

1740
01:34:00,552 --> 01:34:01,927
Okay, fine.

1741
01:34:02,011 --> 01:34:04,221
- Now what?
- Put your hands over your head, please.

1742
01:34:04,347 --> 01:34:05,472
- Like this?
- That's it.

1743
01:34:05,557 --> 01:34:08,016
Hands over your head.

1744
01:34:08,142 --> 01:34:10,435
Wow, this is really sexual.

1745
01:34:10,520 --> 01:34:13,105
Reminds me back of my stripping days.

1746
01:34:13,189 --> 01:34:15,524
They used to call me Magnitude.

1747
01:34:17,151 --> 01:34:18,694
You see anything?

1748
01:34:20,530 --> 01:34:22,030
Can I have you step outside, please?

1749
01:34:22,156 --> 01:34:23,490
Step outside.

1750
01:34:23,575 --> 01:34:24,658
Right this way. Put your hands down.

1751
01:34:24,742 --> 01:34:26,493
- Can I close my Iegs?
- Yes, please.

1752
01:34:26,578 --> 01:34:28,537
Okay, thank you so much.

1753
01:34:29,247 --> 01:34:30,956
- Now what?
- Stand right over here, please.

1754
01:34:31,040 --> 01:34:33,125
- Yes.
- I'm just gonna do a quick pat down.

1755
01:34:33,209 --> 01:34:34,918
- On my body?
- Yes.

1756
01:34:35,044 --> 01:34:36,670
- Go ahead and raise your hands.
- Am I under arrest?

1757
01:34:36,754 --> 01:34:38,171
- No, ma'am.
- Why you patting me down?

1758
01:34:38,256 --> 01:34:40,132
- Just standard procedure.
- A standard...

1759
01:34:40,216 --> 01:34:42,301
- I got to do all this to get on the airplane?
- Yes, please.

1760
01:34:42,385 --> 01:34:44,553
George, I got to do all this
to get on the airplane?

1761
01:34:44,679 --> 01:34:47,681
Ma'am, it's just standard procedure.
I need you to put your hands up, please.

1762
01:34:47,765 --> 01:34:50,350
- Thank you.
- Go on, pat me down.

1763
01:34:50,435 --> 01:34:51,560
Now, wait a minute.

1764
01:34:52,061 --> 01:34:54,813
You gonna find a roadmap to heaven.
You better come on from up there now.

1765
01:34:54,898 --> 01:34:56,273
Come on up.

1766
01:34:57,275 --> 01:34:58,567
Turn around.

1767
01:34:58,693 --> 01:34:59,902
Can I put my hands down?

1768
01:35:00,028 --> 01:35:02,696
Now wait. Now what the hell you doing?

1769
01:35:03,072 --> 01:35:04,406
Boy.

1770
01:35:05,408 --> 01:35:07,701
Something back here
that you wanna tell me about?

1771
01:35:07,785 --> 01:35:11,371
Yes, that's my ass.
It's from wall-to-wall in this skirt.

1772
01:35:12,749 --> 01:35:15,542
We're clear. Go right ahead.

1773
01:35:15,627 --> 01:35:19,338
You need to buy me a cigarette or a drink
or something after doing all that to me.

1774
01:35:19,422 --> 01:35:20,464
You don't know me.

1775
01:35:20,590 --> 01:35:22,174
I ain't felt that many hands
all over my body

1776
01:35:22,258 --> 01:35:23,634
since I got off that train from Mexico.

1777
01:35:23,760 --> 01:35:25,260
Where's my purse and my shoes?

1778
01:35:31,434 --> 01:35:33,852
Anybody ever told you
you Iook Iike Beyoncé?

1779
01:35:33,937 --> 01:35:34,937
No.

1780
01:35:35,063 --> 01:35:37,439
Madea, I found my wifey.

1781
01:35:40,068 --> 01:35:41,526
Shut the hell up back there. You in coach.

1782
01:35:41,611 --> 01:35:43,612
You ain't supposed to talk
to nobody in first class.

1783
01:35:43,738 --> 01:35:46,198
Didn't you see Titanic?

1784
01:35:46,282 --> 01:35:47,658
I'm nervous.

1785
01:35:47,784 --> 01:35:49,618
I know. But behave.

1786
01:35:51,245 --> 01:35:52,496
What the hell was that? What was that?

1787
01:35:53,790 --> 01:35:55,958
There better not be no terrorer on this plane.
Is there a terrorer?

1788
01:35:56,292 --> 01:35:59,127
Is there terrorer on here?
Better not be no terrorer.

1789
01:35:59,796 --> 01:36:01,797
Madea, it's a bump. Bump, bump.

1790
01:36:01,923 --> 01:36:03,715
What the hell a bump doing in the air?
Bumps are on the road.

1791
01:36:03,800 --> 01:36:05,717
- That's all.
- Bumps ain't in the air. Hell.

1792
01:36:05,802 --> 01:36:08,303
This thing just makes me nervous.
I don't Iike being on this thing.

1793
01:36:08,429 --> 01:36:12,224
I got to pee. I need something to relax me.
Calm me down.

1794
01:36:12,308 --> 01:36:13,600
What do you want? What do you want?

1795
01:36:13,685 --> 01:36:16,144
I want a joint.

1796
01:36:16,270 --> 01:36:19,523
- You need that good-good, Madea?
- Boy, shut up.

1797
01:36:19,649 --> 01:36:21,650
Just get me a drink. Can I get a drink?

1798
01:36:21,776 --> 01:36:24,027
Can they get a Iady a drink?
Can a colored woman get a drink?

1799
01:36:24,153 --> 01:36:25,487
I'll get a flight attendant.

1800
01:36:25,613 --> 01:36:28,281
I'll get her. Flight attendant?

1801
01:36:28,366 --> 01:36:32,160
Flight attendant? Flight attendant?
Flight attendant?

1802
01:36:32,286 --> 01:36:34,121
Ma'am, are you okay?

1803
01:36:34,205 --> 01:36:37,332
You're making the other passengers
just a Iittle bit nervous, okay?

1804
01:36:37,458 --> 01:36:38,542
I would Iike something to drink, please.

1805
01:36:38,668 --> 01:36:40,502
'Cause I need something
to relax me just a Iittle bit.

1806
01:36:40,628 --> 01:36:41,670
Okay. What would you Iike?

1807
01:36:41,796 --> 01:36:43,213
That depends. How much is it?

1808
01:36:43,339 --> 01:36:44,756
You're in first class, it's free.

1809
01:36:44,841 --> 01:36:46,758
Okay. Well, bring me every damn thing
you got back there.

1810
01:36:46,843 --> 01:36:47,884
If it's brown, pour it.

1811
01:37:07,822 --> 01:37:11,366
Lord have mercy, I ain't never
seen no place Iike this before.

1812
01:37:12,076 --> 01:37:14,578
They call it the Big Apple, huh?

1813
01:37:15,038 --> 01:37:18,331
I wonder why they call it the Big Apple.
I don't see no apples.

1814
01:37:18,416 --> 01:37:20,500
- Do you see the apples anywhere?
- No.

1815
01:37:24,005 --> 01:37:27,174
I wanna see that thing, too,
that thing with the torch on it.

1816
01:37:27,258 --> 01:37:30,302
The statue. The Statue of Limitations.

1817
01:37:31,179 --> 01:37:32,471
Lord, Iook at all these people.

1818
01:37:32,555 --> 01:37:34,389
I ain't never seen this many
people in one place

1819
01:37:34,474 --> 01:37:36,016
unless they be giving away
government cheese.

1820
01:37:36,100 --> 01:37:39,603
I don't understand why folk would be
all on top of each other Iike this.

1821
01:37:39,937 --> 01:37:42,105
This is too much.
I got to get back to Georgia.

1822
01:37:42,190 --> 01:37:43,982
Come on,
Iet's go get this business done.

1823
01:37:52,450 --> 01:37:55,077
New York!

1824
01:37:55,161 --> 01:37:56,995
Yes indeed, y'all. This is nice.

1825
01:37:57,080 --> 01:37:59,206
- Yeah, I'm in New York, baby.
- How you doing?

1826
01:37:59,290 --> 01:38:01,083
Hello, madame. May I take your bags?

1827
01:38:01,167 --> 01:38:03,251
- Where you gonna take it?
- I'll take it to your room, if you Iike.

1828
01:38:03,336 --> 01:38:06,922
- No. No. No, no.
- She is world-traveled.

1829
01:38:07,006 --> 01:38:10,592
She never think about the Iuggage.

1830
01:38:10,676 --> 01:38:11,843
I don't think about no Iuggage.

1831
01:38:11,928 --> 01:38:15,180
I don't think about no Iuggage
or the garbage or none of that stuff.

1832
01:38:15,264 --> 01:38:16,515
- This way.
- Okay.

1833
01:38:16,599 --> 01:38:19,017
Well, get on out of the way there.
Let a Iady pass.

1834
01:38:19,102 --> 01:38:22,354
You in the way, George, move.
Let them open the door for me.

1835
01:38:26,067 --> 01:38:28,235
Thank you. Thank you so much.

1836
01:38:28,903 --> 01:38:32,531
This place is Iovely. Hello.
Welcome. Thank you. Welcome.

01:38:32,615 --> 01:38:34,950
Welcome to me. My first time here.

01:38:35,034 --> 01:38:36,868
Hello. Hello.

1840
01:38:41,082 --> 01:38:42,582
This is Iovely.

1841
01:38:42,667 --> 01:38:45,377
Run into me one more time,

1842
01:38:45,461 --> 01:38:47,963
What the hell's wrong with you?

1843
01:38:48,047 --> 01:38:49,798
Good afternoon, sir.

And if you would be so kind as to sign here

Well, it was La Toya

01:39:25,251 --> 01:39:26,918

01:39:29,922 --> 01:39:32,090
Excuse me. Excuse me.

Back the hell up. Thank you.

1862
01:39:34,427 --> 01:39:39,181
If I have a phone call from Janet or La Toya
or Rebbie Jackson...

1863
01:39:39,265 --> 01:39:40,974
- Yes, madam?

1864
01:39:41,058 --> 01:39:43,393
- They're always calling me, all the time.
- I see.

1865
01:39:43,477 --> 01:39:45,395
'Cause they need makeup tips and advice.

1866
01:39:45,479 --> 01:39:47,105

1872
01:39:59,327 --> 01:40:01,995
You hit me with these bags one more time,
I will knock the hell out of you.

1873
01:40:02,079 --> 01:40:03,997
- What's in here?
- Get the hell on the elevator.

1874
01:40:04,081 --> 01:40:05,498
You got two midgets in here.

1875
01:40:08,836 --> 01:40:12,088
If Randy or Jermaine or Tito call,

1876
01:40:12,173 --> 01:40:16,092
tell them I just cannot talk right now,
I'm gonna have to call them Iater.

1877
01:40:16,177 --> 01:40:17,344
Very good, madam. I have that.

1878
01:40:17,428 --> 01:40:18,970
What the hell you

1879
01:40:23,851 --> 01:40:25,936
I know how to open the door, here. This...

1880
01:40:26,479 --> 01:40:28,146
This is nice.

1881
01:40:29,440 --> 01:40:32,067
Oh, Lord, this furniture nice.

1882
01:40:32,151 --> 01:40:34,277
Ain't got no plastic on it.
Can't be too nice, though.

1883
01:40:34,612 --> 01:40:36,029
- How you doing?
- Good.

1884
01:40:36,113 --> 01:40:38,490
- Wonderful. Hello.
- Hello.

1885
01:40:39,158 --> 01:40:40,909
Your chocolate.

1886
01:40:40,993 --> 01:40:42,994
Yes, I know I'm chocolate.

1887
01:40:43,704 --> 01:40:47,832
That's a new way of saying "black"?
I'm chocolate, yes. African-American.

1888
01:40:48,334 --> 01:40:53,338
Forgive madame.
She is, how you say, preoccupée.

1889
01:40:53,798 --> 01:40:57,050
You gonna stop calling me madame.
My name is Madea, not madame.

1890
01:40:57,551 --> 01:40:58,885
Zip it.

1891
01:40:59,762 --> 01:41:02,514
- For you, monsieur. Thank you.
- Thank you. Thank you.

1892
01:41:04,058 --> 01:41:05,308
What the hell was he just
standing up here for,

1893
01:41:05,393 --> 01:41:07,018
just Iooking all scary and weird?

1894
01:41:07,103 --> 01:41:08,353
I thought I had
checked into the Bates Motel.

1895
01:41:08,437 --> 01:41:09,437
He's standing there Iike that.

1896
01:41:09,772 --> 01:41:12,148
- What was he waiting for?
- A gratuity.

1897
01:41:12,858 --> 01:41:15,026
- What is that?
- A tip.

1898
01:41:15,111 --> 01:41:17,195
Why didn't you just say "tip"?
I know what the hell a tip is.

1899
01:41:17,280 --> 01:41:20,407
Now, George, how much did you just
give that man? You gave him paper money.

1900
01:41:20,491 --> 01:41:22,409
- How much was that?
- Twenty.

1901
01:41:23,577 --> 01:41:24,953
Twenty what?

1902
01:41:25,037 --> 01:41:26,579
Dollars. $20.

1903
01:41:27,623 --> 01:41:29,374
Have you Iost your mind, George?

1904
01:41:29,458 --> 01:41:31,918
Waiter! Excuse me. Excuse me, sir.

1905
01:41:32,003 --> 01:41:35,755
Hello, mister. Can I talk to you
forjust a second?

1906
01:41:35,840 --> 01:41:38,091
Mister? I'm tired as hell.

1907
01:41:38,175 --> 01:41:41,177
Here. Hold this for me, baby,
and Iet me hold that. That's $20.

1908
01:41:41,262 --> 01:41:44,431
Baby, Iisten, if we wanted that for chocolate,
we'd go get us a Snickers.

1909
01:41:44,515 --> 01:41:45,557
Here's your tip.

1910
01:41:45,641 --> 01:41:47,559
Pardon, monsieur, she is...

1911
01:41:49,395 --> 01:41:52,647
- Movez-vous. Movez-vous.
- Go on. Go on. $20?

1912
01:41:52,732 --> 01:41:56,318
Would you get a grip?
You've got to play the part.

1913
01:41:56,402 --> 01:41:58,653
Trust me. Appearance is everything. Okay?

1914
01:41:58,738 --> 01:41:59,946
Now, we need to get some rest

1915
01:42:00,031 --> 01:42:03,033
so we can get to the bank early
and get out of here.

1916
01:42:03,117 --> 01:42:04,784
That's fine.
Let's get some rest, then, George.

1917
01:42:04,869 --> 01:42:07,287
But you ain't gonna give no $20 to nobody.
That's just damn crazy.

1918
01:42:07,371 --> 01:42:09,664
Child, if Joe could see me now.

1919
01:42:11,959 --> 01:42:13,960
This mattress is nice.

1920
01:42:15,129 --> 01:42:17,547
No, can't Iay down flat Iike that.

1921
01:42:18,799 --> 01:42:22,177
Yeah. Women who is well-endowed
can't Iay flat.

1922
01:42:23,262 --> 01:42:24,929
'Cause them breasts will
sneak up around your neck

1923
01:42:25,014 --> 01:42:27,307
and choke the hell out of you
through the night.

1924
01:42:27,391 --> 01:42:29,976
Got to throw them over to the side.

1925
01:42:31,145 --> 01:42:32,604
This is nice.

1926
01:42:34,315 --> 01:42:36,274
Silk.

1927
01:42:39,278 --> 01:42:41,071
Okay, here we go. Here we go.

1928
01:42:41,155 --> 01:42:42,822
Now remember, you're Precious Jackson,

1929
01:42:42,907 --> 01:42:45,867
and you wanna get all the money
transferred into the 12 accounts.

1930
01:42:45,951 --> 01:42:47,452
You can't keep running this
over and over again.

1931
01:42:47,536 --> 01:42:49,913
- You're gonna make me forget everything.
- Okay. This is it. This is it.

1932
01:42:49,997 --> 01:42:51,664
I understand.
You gonna make me forget everything.

1933
01:42:51,749 --> 01:42:53,124
I can't keep doing this over and over again.

1934
01:42:53,209 --> 01:42:55,210
- Just relax.
- AII right, I got it.

1935
01:42:55,294 --> 01:42:59,339
I'm relaxed, George, I'm relaxed.
But you tensing me the hell up.

1936
01:42:59,423 --> 01:43:01,424
- Okay. Okay.
- Okay.

1937
01:43:01,509 --> 01:43:03,635
- Got it?
- I got it. I got it.

1938
01:43:08,974 --> 01:43:10,016
Madea.

1939
01:43:11,894 --> 01:43:12,894
Yes?

1940
01:43:13,854 --> 01:43:19,317
Remember, the man you're meeting,
his name is Jack Goldenberg.

1941
01:43:20,444 --> 01:43:22,695
What the hell you speaking
a French accent for, George?

1942
01:43:22,780 --> 01:43:23,905
This is me and you talking.

1943
01:43:23,989 --> 01:43:25,448
Hell, I know how to speak French, too.

1944
01:43:27,618 --> 01:43:28,701
Shut the hell up.

1945
01:43:28,786 --> 01:43:32,539
I got it. Jack Goldenberg.

1946
01:43:32,623 --> 01:43:34,290
- Thank you.
- Okay.

1947
01:43:36,585 --> 01:43:39,045
Excuse me while I do my Tyra Banks.

1948
01:43:53,978 --> 01:43:55,186
Hello.

1949
01:43:57,523 --> 01:44:01,192
Can you help me?
I'm here to see Whoopi Goldberg.

1950
01:44:02,361 --> 01:44:03,695
Excuse me?

1951
01:44:05,948 --> 01:44:09,367
Silly me. I'm sorry.
I was just watching The View.

1952
01:44:09,452 --> 01:44:15,248
I'm here to see Jack Goldenberg.
Jack Goldenberg.

1953
01:44:15,332 --> 01:44:17,625
- May I tell him who's here?
- Yes...

1954
01:44:18,794 --> 01:44:21,671
I'm sorry, I was about to say,
"What a mighty God we serve."

1955
01:44:23,299 --> 01:44:27,051
Precious Jackson is my name.
I'm a part of the Jackson family.

1956
01:44:27,136 --> 01:44:29,554
Yes. But, you know,
they put me on the outskirts.

1957
01:44:29,638 --> 01:44:32,182
- So now, it's just me and Bubbles.
- Bubbles.

1958
01:44:32,308 --> 01:44:33,558
- Yeah, yeah.
- That the monkey?

1959
01:44:33,642 --> 01:44:35,101
- Yeah, great Iittle monkey.
- Oh, my God.

1960
01:44:35,186 --> 01:44:38,980
Yeah. I call him Joe,
but everybody else calls him Bubbles.

1961
01:44:40,316 --> 01:44:41,691
You certainly do have an appointment.

1962
01:44:42,735 --> 01:44:45,153
Precious Jackson to see you.

1963
01:44:45,237 --> 01:44:48,072
Hello. Hi. Thank you so much, Magdalene.

1964
01:44:48,157 --> 01:44:49,741
- It's so great to see you.
- How can I help you?

1965
01:44:49,825 --> 01:44:53,453
Jack, I called you.

1966
01:44:53,537 --> 01:44:57,040
We spoke about all the transfers
that I need to do.

1967
01:44:57,166 --> 01:45:01,169
I got that request Iast evening. Let me see.

1968
01:45:01,253 --> 01:45:04,631
Jack, can we do this? I'd Iike
to add one more account to that.

1969
01:45:04,715 --> 01:45:07,717
Because I'm feeling so generous
and I've given to so many charities.

1970
01:45:07,843 --> 01:45:11,054
Here is the account number.
I know that's 12, this'll be the 13th.

1971
01:45:11,347 --> 01:45:13,264
- Thirteenth?
- Yes.

1972
01:45:13,349 --> 01:45:16,935
And, of course, in this economic climate,
you're gonna need my identification.

1973
01:45:17,019 --> 01:45:18,478
Precious Jackson. Here you are.

1974
01:45:18,562 --> 01:45:20,188
- Well, thank you.
- Okay.

1975
01:45:22,024 --> 01:45:23,483
She's been in there way too Iong.

1976
01:45:23,567 --> 01:45:25,568
She's not. She hasn't been,
and she's doing a mission.

1977
01:45:25,694 --> 01:45:27,654
Very dangerous work she's doing.

1978
01:45:27,738 --> 01:45:30,073
You're just...
You know what? You're such a...

1979
01:45:30,199 --> 01:45:32,909
I'd hate to be cliff-diving with you.

1980
01:45:40,626 --> 01:45:42,502
Look, I saw this in a movie once.

1981
01:45:42,586 --> 01:45:45,004
You go east, I go west,
we meet in the subway.

1982
01:45:45,089 --> 01:45:46,130
We'll make it out alive.

1983
01:45:46,215 --> 01:45:49,175
I'm not running with you. Okay?

1984
01:45:49,260 --> 01:45:52,470
I'm not running down the street
Iike some biatch.

1985
01:45:52,555 --> 01:45:54,514
Like some biatch, okay?

1986
01:45:54,598 --> 01:45:56,849
Wait. What are you talking about, fool?

1987
01:45:56,934 --> 01:45:59,102
I'm committed to see this through.

1988
01:45:59,228 --> 01:46:01,271
You know what they'll do with you
with that mustache in jail?

1989
01:46:01,397 --> 01:46:03,231
You better not snitch.

1990
01:46:03,899 --> 01:46:05,525
- Please.
- You kill me.

1991
01:46:05,609 --> 01:46:06,693
- There she is.
- Oh, my goodness.

1992
01:46:06,777 --> 01:46:09,988
- Jack, you kill me.
- Now, our cover.

1993
01:46:10,072 --> 01:46:11,447
- Yes, thank you.
- She got it.

1994
01:46:11,574 --> 01:46:15,159
But if there's anything else you need,
you call Jack Goldenberg directly.

1995
01:46:15,244 --> 01:46:16,953
I certainly will. I certainly will.

1996
01:46:17,288 --> 01:46:19,080
- May I help you?
- Oh, you're delightful.

1997
01:46:19,206 --> 01:46:21,291
- What a Iovely woman.
- No. I've got it. I've got it.

1998
01:46:21,417 --> 01:46:23,543
You got to stop flirting with me.
You ain't getting nothing.

1999
01:46:23,627 --> 01:46:26,462
I see you Iooking at my ass.
Don't you do that. Don't you do that.

2000
01:46:26,589 --> 01:46:28,631
- I would never do that.
- Stop that flirting with me.

2001
01:46:28,757 --> 01:46:30,758
- What a woman. What a woman.
- Thank you so much.

2002
01:46:30,884 --> 01:46:33,261
- I'll see you Iater. AII right.
- Well, our pleasure again.

2003
01:46:33,387 --> 01:46:34,596
- Did you get it?
- Yes.

2004
01:46:34,722 --> 01:46:36,472
- Let's go.
- Yes.

2005
01:46:48,068 --> 01:46:50,612
Thank you very much, sir. Thank you.

2006
01:46:51,280 --> 01:46:53,072
Well, what did he say?

2007
01:46:53,449 --> 01:46:59,162
Well, he's not very happy and neither am I
that you took my aunt up to New York.

2008
01:46:59,288 --> 01:47:00,997
To that bank. That's crazy.

2009
01:47:01,123 --> 01:47:04,375
But he's getting a Iot of calls
from the charities, they're very happy.

2010
01:47:04,460 --> 01:47:08,129
The press is very excited about it,
so he's okay, and so am I.

2011
01:47:08,631 --> 01:47:11,382
Well, what does that mean for me?

2012
01:47:11,467 --> 01:47:14,886
You've helped us gather enough information
and evidence against your former bosses

2013
01:47:14,970 --> 01:47:17,138
that we got a pretty solid case.

2014
01:47:17,264 --> 01:47:18,848
With that information, we pressured them,

2015
01:47:18,974 --> 01:47:20,933
and they've agreed to testify
against the Malone family,

2016
01:47:21,018 --> 01:47:22,060
so they won't be after you.

2017
01:47:22,144 --> 01:47:25,647
So we just talked about
dropping the charges against you.

2018
01:47:26,190 --> 01:47:29,275
What you did,
getting those accounts back in order,

2019
01:47:29,360 --> 01:47:32,695
and having all that money wired
back to the charities, all 13 of them,

2020
01:47:33,947 --> 01:47:35,740
it's really great.

2021
01:47:35,824 --> 01:47:39,452
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it was.

2022
01:47:39,536 --> 01:47:40,828
You're free to go, George.

2023
01:47:40,954 --> 01:47:42,830
- So I'm free?
- Yeah.

2024
01:47:43,916 --> 01:47:44,999
Enjoy your Iife, George.

2025
01:47:45,084 --> 01:47:48,002
Take care of yourself.
Stay out of trouble.

2026
01:47:48,087 --> 01:47:56,594
Thank you.

2027
01:47:57,179 --> 01:47:58,680
The other way.

2028
01:47:59,807 --> 01:48:01,140
Thank you.

2029
01:48:03,435 --> 01:48:06,854
This has been Iovely.
It's just been so fun having y'all here.

2030
01:48:06,939 --> 01:48:09,190
Madea, thank you.

2031
01:48:09,316 --> 01:48:10,942
Thanks for everything.

2032
01:48:11,026 --> 01:48:13,778
You have no idea how much
I wanna say, "Get the hell out."

2033
01:48:13,862 --> 01:48:16,781
But I'm holding that in, because
I'm showing so much Iove to you.

2034
01:48:16,865 --> 01:48:18,282
I enjoyed having y'all here.

2035
01:48:18,367 --> 01:48:20,326
The best part about company
is when they Ieave.

2036
01:48:20,703 --> 01:48:22,829
I'm gonna miss you so much, Madea.

2037
01:48:23,205 --> 01:48:27,208
That's okay, child. AII them potatoes
in my house is glad you Ieaving.

2038
01:48:27,292 --> 01:48:28,793
- Me, too.
- Yeah?

2039
01:48:28,877 --> 01:48:30,545
Can we come back and visit?

2040
01:48:32,881 --> 01:48:34,882
That is so sweet.
You wanna come back and visit?

2041
01:48:34,967 --> 01:48:37,468
No, I don't think so. I'm sorry.

2042
01:48:37,553 --> 01:48:38,636
You can write me Ietters, though.

2043
01:48:38,721 --> 01:48:42,807
Long, Iong, Iong Ietters. Dissertations
from very, very, very far away.

2044
01:48:42,891 --> 01:48:44,308
Negros.

2045
01:48:48,689 --> 01:48:51,315
Okay, time to get her the hell out of here.

2046
01:48:51,400 --> 01:48:53,735
- Spirituals.
- Now she gets it.

2047
01:48:53,861 --> 01:48:57,071
Okay, Mom, Iet's go. One Iast time.

2048
01:48:57,156 --> 01:48:58,489
Let's go.

2049
01:48:59,867 --> 01:49:02,160
There's my boy. There's my boy.

2050
01:49:02,244 --> 01:49:04,203
Bye, Joe. I'll be back.

2051
01:49:05,080 --> 01:49:07,582
I'll be back, Joe. Bye.

2052
01:49:07,708 --> 01:49:09,250
- Y'all, come on.
- Bye.

2053
01:49:09,334 --> 01:49:11,252
Mabel, get them the hell out of here now.

2054
01:49:11,336 --> 01:49:12,503
I'll see y'all around.

2055
01:49:13,046 --> 01:49:14,922
Bye. Bye.

2056
01:49:15,048 --> 01:49:16,382
- Bye.
- Bye.

2057
01:49:30,898 --> 01:49:31,898
Yes!

2058
01:49:45,078 --> 01:49:46,746
- Love you, Dad.
- Love you, Son.

2059
01:50:23,492 --> 01:50:24,492
Yeah!

2060
01:50:25,369 --> 01:50:27,286
I did that. I got that money, baby.

2061
01:50:27,412 --> 01:50:30,498
I got that money!

2062
01:50:35,754 --> 01:50:37,463
I don't want to go to prison,
because, you know?

2063
01:50:37,548 --> 01:50:39,632
Food is bad,
I'm probably gonna Iose weight.

2064
01:50:39,716 --> 01:50:42,510
Probably go down to nothing
and get gang-raped.

2065
01:50:42,594 --> 01:50:44,512
I don't wanna shower in prison.

2066
01:50:44,596 --> 01:50:48,307
They can do strange things to you in prison.

2067
01:50:48,392 --> 01:50:50,017
Do you understand? Do you understand?

2068
01:50:50,102 --> 01:50:54,397
I think I can handle myself. I really do.

2069
01:50:54,523 --> 01:50:57,191
I really do. I just don't want
to go through the experience

2070
01:50:57,276 --> 01:50:59,360
of having to do that. Okay?

2071
01:50:59,444 --> 01:51:01,863
I don't want to have to worry
about other guys in there.

2072
01:51:01,947 --> 01:51:05,241
When I get so mad,
I'm gonna have to use my fists,

2073
01:51:05,325 --> 01:51:07,743
you know, just to defend myself.

2074
01:51:07,828 --> 01:51:10,121
Go upstairs and get your mom's pills.

2075
01:51:10,205 --> 01:51:14,041
- Find a Iittle straitjacket and calm down...
- And a straitjacket, too.

2076
01:51:14,126 --> 01:51:15,751
Figure this out, Maysie.

2077
01:51:15,836 --> 01:51:17,295
And then you put in that fatback grease,

2078
01:51:17,379 --> 01:51:19,672
and you make sure it just sits there
and soak, so it'll be Iight.

2079
01:51:19,756 --> 01:51:21,132
I got some oatmeal on the stove,

2080
01:51:21,216 --> 01:51:23,301
and I got some greens
that's gonna clean you out.

2081
01:51:23,385 --> 01:51:25,011
It's Iike none of this is gonna matter.

2082
01:51:26,513 --> 01:51:27,555
AII right.

2083
01:51:27,639 --> 01:51:30,182
That's pretty good for never doing it.

2084
01:51:30,976 --> 01:51:32,226
Oh, boy.

2085
01:51:33,645 --> 01:51:36,022
- Is she doing it, too? Wow.
- Yeah.

2086
01:51:36,565 --> 01:51:38,482
She kept her promise.

2087
01:51:38,567 --> 01:51:40,526
- What the hell? Charlie Sheen.
- Hey. What a surprise.

2088
01:51:40,611 --> 01:51:42,945
How are you? Look who back here.
Look who back here hiding.

2089
01:51:43,030 --> 01:51:44,071
It's Charlie Sheen.

2090
01:51:44,156 --> 01:51:45,573
- Big fan.
- I'm a big fan of yours, too.

2091
01:51:45,657 --> 01:51:46,824
I've wanted to do this ever since... I'm sorry.

2092
01:51:46,909 --> 01:51:49,493
- That's freaky. That's freaky. That's freaky.
- Damn. Sorry, sorry.

2093
01:51:49,578 --> 01:51:52,163
Go on. Go on, rest yourself. Rest yourself.

2094
01:51:52,247 --> 01:51:54,707
- No motorboating. No motorboating.
- Cut.

2095
01:51:55,375 --> 01:51:56,500
Where's Howie?

2096
01:51:56,585 --> 01:51:58,794
Oh, God, you don't even want to know
what happened to Howie.

2097
01:51:58,879 --> 01:52:00,504
It was so awful.

2098
01:52:00,589 --> 01:52:03,299
They just told me there was
a buffalo and a monkey somewhere,

2099
01:52:03,383 --> 01:52:07,136
and I just have not been able to figure
how they got out of the zoo.

2100
01:52:07,220 --> 01:52:08,721
I'm sorry.

2101
01:52:10,015 --> 01:52:12,642
I am 6'4" tall and a woman.

2102
01:52:12,726 --> 01:52:14,727
Do you think I have self-esteem issues?

2103
01:52:14,811 --> 01:52:17,521
I ain't never played for the WNBA,
but I could.

2104
01:52:17,606 --> 01:52:19,398
I ain't got no self-esteem issues, hell.

2105
01:52:19,483 --> 01:52:23,152
I got a mustache. Do you understand?
I'm a dude up under this stuff.

2106
01:52:23,654 --> 01:52:27,573
Sorry, this is Precious Jackson.
I'm in the Presidential Suite.

2107
01:52:27,824 --> 01:52:31,035
And there are two toilets here.

2108
01:52:31,119 --> 01:52:35,331
And I was trying to figure out,
which one am I supposed to use?

2109
01:52:35,415 --> 01:52:40,294
I don't know which one suits me best.
One of them has things on it Iike a faucet.

2110
01:52:40,921 --> 01:52:42,630
What is that for?

2111
01:52:45,217 --> 01:52:47,385
Yes, you know how you turn on the faucet.

2112
01:52:50,055 --> 01:52:52,765
I'm not a sir, I'm a ma'am.
You don't hear me, honey?

2113
01:52:54,142 --> 01:52:56,978
Okay, yes, there's two toilets here.

2114
01:52:57,062 --> 01:53:00,356
There's one that I recognize and
then there's one that I don't recognize.

2115
01:53:00,440 --> 01:53:04,276
It's got two handles on it, Iike you gonna
wash your hands or something.

2116
01:53:04,361 --> 01:53:06,195
A bidet? What is a bidet, honey?

2117
01:53:06,279 --> 01:53:10,157
I don't need Bengays and all that stuff.
Just trying to figure out what the toilet is.

2118
01:53:16,289 --> 01:53:18,082
Right. Your hands?

2119
01:53:20,293 --> 01:53:22,336
It's for washing your ass?

2120
01:53:25,882 --> 01:53:28,175
No, when I wanna wash my ass,
I take a bath, honey.

2121
01:53:28,260 --> 01:53:30,469
That's just nasty. Now who'd do that?

2122
01:53:33,348 --> 01:53:35,808
Listen, I didn't know
you were gonna answer the phone.

2123
01:53:35,892 --> 01:53:38,394
I thought the phone was disconnected.
I'm so sorry.

2124
01:53:38,478 --> 01:53:40,855
Okay. I'll talk to you Iater. Bye.

2125
01:53:42,357 --> 01:53:43,774
There was actually somebody there?

2126
01:53:43,859 --> 01:53:46,819
Yes. Yes, the whole time.

2127
01:53:46,903 --> 01:53:49,780
She was trying to explain to me what it was.

2128
01:53:50,240 --> 01:53:53,659
I'd Iike to order one of your famous...

2129
01:53:55,454 --> 01:53:59,081
Baby, this say hamburgers $45.
What the hell is on the burger?

2130
01:54:00,333 --> 01:54:03,961
No, no, no. For $45,
there better be more than a hamburger.

2131
01:54:05,464 --> 01:54:09,842
For $45, it better get up in this bed
and roll around with me for a Iittle while.

2132
01:54:11,178 --> 01:54:13,554
You don't think that's funny. Okay.

2133
01:54:13,638 --> 01:54:17,058
No. Do you have chicken wings?

2134
01:54:19,186 --> 01:54:20,227
You don't do those.

2135
01:54:20,312 --> 01:54:23,397
Well, maybe you can ask the chef
to prepare them for me, then.

2136
01:54:24,483 --> 01:54:25,691
Yes.

2137
01:54:25,776 --> 01:54:30,029
How many would I Iike? That depends.
How many are there in the order?

2138
01:54:31,656 --> 01:54:35,576
Okay, seven chicken wings. Okay.
How much are the seven chicken wings?

2139
01:54:39,164 --> 01:54:40,539
$30 a wing?

2140
01:54:41,833 --> 01:54:43,793
30 damn dollars a wing?

2141
01:54:45,087 --> 01:54:47,671
You crazy as hell. People pay that?

2142
01:54:48,465 --> 01:54:51,258
No, honey, I can't.
$30 for a damn chicken wing?

2143
01:54:51,343 --> 01:54:52,843
Do you know that I can get 20 of them,

2144
01:54:52,928 --> 01:54:55,721
they come in a pack,
20 for $1 .99 down at Roscoe's?

2145
01:54:55,806 --> 01:54:58,891
I can't have this, honey.
No, I'm gonna starve in this hotel.

2146
01:54:59,392 --> 01:55:04,522
My name is Precious Jackson.

2147
01:55:05,357 --> 01:55:08,150
My name is Melinda.

2148
01:55:08,819 --> 01:55:10,486
