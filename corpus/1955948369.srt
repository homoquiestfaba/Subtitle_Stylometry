1
00:00:05,433 --> 00:00:10,300
(foreboding music)

2
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:23,233
(distant police siren blaring)

3
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:30,500
- Hey, what'cha got?

4
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:31,867
- Thank you officer.

5
00:04:31,867 --> 00:04:33,067
- [Woman] Really?

6
00:04:34,367 --> 00:04:36,267
- [Officer] We haven't
 touched anything.

7
00:04:36,267 --> 00:04:38,267
We've been waiting on y'all.

8
00:04:38,267 --> 00:04:42,633
Two bodies inside,
 kicked in door.

9
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,100
Give or take, man, size 11.

10
00:04:46,767 --> 00:04:48,900
A man was shooting
 after a woman.

11
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,067
- Where's the woman?

12
00:04:50,067 --> 00:04:52,567
- ER, she was shot
 in the shoulder.

13
00:04:52,567 --> 00:04:54,067
- And the guy?

14
00:04:54,067 --> 00:04:57,400
- We surrounded him, told
 him to drop his weapon,

15
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,267
he shot himself.

16
00:04:59,267 --> 00:05:03,400
We immediately identified
 him, Gambit Nelly, drifter.

17
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:07,067
In and out of prison,
 mostly aggravated assault.

18
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:10,700
Ah, one more thing.

19
00:05:12,467 --> 00:05:16,133
Wherever I was checking
 around inside the house...

20
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,433
Well I went and looked
in some of the rooms...

21
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,900
Something ain't right in there.

22
00:05:24,467 --> 00:05:26,933
It's just not the best way
 that you wanna start your day.

23
00:05:27,067 --> 00:05:28,200
- Right.

24
00:05:28,667 --> 00:05:29,400
Looking forward to it.

25
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,367
- Yeah...

26
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:35,267
(ominous music)

27
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,233
- How's it coming, anything?

28
00:05:43,233 --> 00:05:44,667
- Nothing yet.

29
00:05:45,067 --> 00:05:46,433
You?

30
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,900
- [Male forensic specialist]
 There aren't any prints.

31
00:06:06,767 --> 00:06:09,667
- I need a toxicology
 report as soon as possible.

32
00:06:09,667 --> 00:06:12,100
- Sure, I'll run that
 by the lab for you.

33
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:21,900
- No signs of a struggle,

34
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,600
or attempted retaliation.

35
00:06:23,733 --> 00:06:25,833
Nails are intact,
 they're not broken.

36
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:27,967
It's a single shot to the head.

37
00:06:28,667 --> 00:06:30,867
Now it would appear that
projected high velocity

38
00:06:30,867 --> 00:06:33,167
blood splatter was transferred

39
00:06:33,167 --> 00:06:35,500
and she was shot in
 a seated position.

40
00:06:36,067 --> 00:06:37,433
(gunshot)

41
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,867
- But when she shot herself,
 I mean that would explain

42
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:43,133
the 9mm handgun.

43
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,067
- Dr. Gates, I'm
 detective Salinas

44
00:06:59,067 --> 00:07:00,933
and this is detective Farrell.

45
00:07:00,933 --> 00:07:02,733
- [Dr. Gates] Good
 morning detectives.

46
00:07:02,733 --> 00:07:04,900
- I've heard a lot of
 good things about you,

47
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,333
I'm reading your latest book,

48
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:08,433
"The Psychosis of
 the Criminal Mind".

49
00:07:08,433 --> 00:07:10,800
Uhm, any first impressions?

50
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,333
- [Dr. Gates] I
 think the two victims

51
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:14,567
liked to roll in
their own filth.

52
00:07:14,633 --> 00:07:17,067
- Well the doors were kicked in.

53
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,433
Maybe they were already dead?

54
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:24,333
- [Farrell] Both victims
already dead in their own house?

55
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,967
Something here is not right.

56
00:07:28,067 --> 00:07:30,900
- Well maybe he
 accidentally overdosed

57
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:34,133
and she took her own life,
 like Shakespeare said,

58
00:07:34,133 --> 00:07:36,467
"A normal man can
 not be without love."

59
00:07:36,467 --> 00:07:38,567
- It's not Romeo and Juliet.

60
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:48,200
(anticipating music)

61
00:07:58,067 --> 00:08:00,367
- Why would there be
 a bullet in the wall?

62
00:08:01,733 --> 00:08:03,700
- Well according
 to Officer Roberts,

63
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,600
the neighbor who called
was still on the line

64
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,800
with 911 when three more
gunshots were heard.

65
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,700
- [Operator] What's
 the emergency?

66
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,300
- I hear gunshots next door.

67
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,467
(gunshots)

68
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:50,100
(ominous music)

69
00:08:54,767 --> 00:08:56,200
- [Farrell] These
 sadist motherfuckers

70
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:59,067
just might be the weirdest
 my career has ever seen.

71
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,267
Or will ever see.

72
00:09:33,967 --> 00:09:36,700
You've seen that collection
 of sex toys in here?

73
00:09:37,067 --> 00:09:38,267
- Sex toys?

74
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,800
- [Farrell] Why won't
 this drawer open?

75
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:47,067
I bet somebody kept all their
 little goodies right in here.

76
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,067
Damn this thing
 really is sealed shut.

77
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,300
- I've seen this
 before, in a book.

78
00:09:55,067 --> 00:09:57,567
Some pretty sadistic
 containment.

79
00:09:58,067 --> 00:10:00,333
I think they were
lowered down with ropes,

80
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:03,667
that's from the 15th century,
 why would we create it now?

81
00:10:05,033 --> 00:10:06,367
- [Farrell] Almost got it.

82
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:10,500
Let's see what's
behind door number one.

83
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:12,600
(gasps)

84
00:10:13,267 --> 00:10:14,333
- Farrell!

85
00:10:14,967 --> 00:10:18,400
Officer down, help me, help me!

86
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:22,033
Officer down, no, no,
 help me, officer down!

87
00:10:22,667 --> 00:10:23,600
- [Voiceover] Are we on?

88
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,967
- [Voiceover] Yeah.

89
00:10:24,967 --> 00:10:26,900
- We're live at the crime
 scene, I am standing

90
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:29,100
in front of the house
 where at four o'clock

91
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,300
this morning neighbors
 heard gunshots.

92
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:33,500
When the police arrived
they found a young man

93
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,767
shooting a woman, that
 young man was asked

94
00:10:35,767 --> 00:10:39,167
repeatedly to drop his
 weapon, he refused,

95
00:10:39,167 --> 00:10:40,667
and shot himself.

96
00:10:40,667 --> 00:10:43,133
When police inspected the
 building they found two bodies

97
00:10:43,133 --> 00:10:47,667
which were later confirmed to
 be the alleged serial killers.

98
00:10:48,533 --> 00:10:51,867
- [Dr. Gates] There is something
very very wrong here chief.

99
00:10:51,867 --> 00:10:54,667
- Are you trying to suggest
 something, Dr. Gates?

100
00:10:54,667 --> 00:10:57,000
- Not at all, I'm simply
trying to point out

101
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,433
that this was preventable.

102
00:11:00,633 --> 00:11:02,900
- I don't think you
 understand the limited ability

103
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:05,100
of police work, Dr. Gates.

104
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:08,067
Sure, in your analytical,
 academic point of view,

105
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:10,200
this might have
 been preventable.

106
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,800
But in the real world
 where I live and breathe,

107
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,633
things are very different.

108
00:11:14,633 --> 00:11:16,100
They're waiting for us.

109
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:20,900
(anticipating music)

110
00:11:23,167 --> 00:11:24,433
- [Various journalists]
Chief, chief, chief!

111
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:25,667
- [Voiceover] Chief, do
you have any suspects?

112
00:11:25,667 --> 00:11:27,300
- [Voiceover] Do you
have a lead on suspects?

113
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,633
- The DA has asked me to
give a statement for him

114
00:11:29,633 --> 00:11:32,067
as well as the
 police department.

115
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,100
These are certainly the
worst events we've seen,

116
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,367
during my 20 years on the force.

117
00:11:37,367 --> 00:11:39,133
But after meeting with
 state and local officials

118
00:11:39,133 --> 00:11:42,300
this morning I can assure
 the people of Fieldhouse

119
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:46,067
that we have the best law
 enforcement on the case.

120
00:11:46,267 --> 00:11:47,967
We will get to
 the bottom of this

121
00:11:47,967 --> 00:11:50,300
and see that justice is done.

122
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:54,567
And whoever is responsible
 for these killings will pay.

123
00:11:54,567 --> 00:11:57,300
These murders took
 place on McCoy Street,

124
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,067
but the murder victim
 identities will

125
00:11:59,067 --> 00:12:01,400
not be released at this time.

126
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,167
Authorities also
believe that the victims

127
00:12:03,167 --> 00:12:06,867
themselves may be tied to
 a list of other murders.

128
00:12:07,567 --> 00:12:09,400
Unfortunately during
 the investigation

129
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:13,433
earlier this morning,
 Fieldhouse police lost one.

130
00:12:14,133 --> 00:12:17,333
Detective Farrell was
 killed in the line of duty.

131
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:20,167
It is believed that the
house was booby trapped,

132
00:12:20,167 --> 00:12:22,067
and we have been
 asked to back down now

133
00:12:22,067 --> 00:12:25,533
while the house is thoroughly
 searched for other devices.

134
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,467
There will be a memorial
 service for Detective Farrell

135
00:12:28,467 --> 00:12:32,367
in the next few days,
 may he rest in peace

136
00:12:32,367 --> 00:12:34,067
and may God be with us.

137
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,067
(various journalists
 shout over each other)

138
00:12:36,067 --> 00:12:38,067
- [Bald man] Hey, over here!

139
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,500
These dark souls, who
 you are now getting

140
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:44,700
acquainted with,
 are finally dead.

141
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:48,200
And for that, I thank God.

142
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:51,567
You know you all
 are a fucking joke.

143
00:12:51,567 --> 00:12:53,500
Y'all knew for years some
 crazy ass shit like this

144
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:57,067
was bound to be going
 down and did nothing.

145
00:12:57,367 --> 00:13:00,133
So don't sit there and say
 you're going do anything.

146
00:13:00,133 --> 00:13:03,267
What needed to be
done, it's a done deal.

147
00:13:03,267 --> 00:13:05,800
Those dark souls,
 they up outta here.

148
00:13:06,133 --> 00:13:09,567
No one can be hurt
 by them anymore.

149
00:13:09,967 --> 00:13:11,200
Fuck this.

150
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,633
(various journalists
 shout over each other)

151
00:13:13,633 --> 00:13:15,867
- No more questions
thank you for you time.

152
00:13:15,867 --> 00:13:17,400
There will be another
 briefing tomorrow at 11 AM.

153
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,800
- [Voiceover] Is it true
that a witness was shot

154
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,900
and is now missing?

155
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,533
- [Voiceover] Chief Gonzales!

156
00:13:21,833 --> 00:13:23,167
- [News Anchor] And
 after the break.

157
00:13:23,167 --> 00:13:25,100
The middle ages are back.

158
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:28,133
Alleged serial killers'
bodies were found today

159
00:13:28,133 --> 00:13:31,633
and a replica of the
 worst torture devices used

160
00:13:31,633 --> 00:13:33,167
in that century.

161
00:13:33,167 --> 00:13:36,067
When local authorities
 were contacted today,

162
00:13:36,067 --> 00:13:39,700
neighbors reported hearing
 gunshots come from the house.

163
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:42,100
They found more
 evidence which raises

164
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:46,200
even more questions
 in this investigation.

165
00:13:48,933 --> 00:13:51,433
(faint police siren blaring)

166
00:13:52,633 --> 00:13:54,867
- I know, look, I couldn't
 believe it either.

167
00:13:54,867 --> 00:13:57,267
Commando, you really
 need to come--

168
00:13:58,233 --> 00:13:59,433
- Excuse me?

169
00:13:59,433 --> 00:14:00,967
- Yes, how can I
 help you officer?

170
00:14:00,967 --> 00:14:02,667
- The shooting in McCoy Street.

171
00:14:02,667 --> 00:14:04,933
The woman with a gunshot wound.

172
00:14:04,933 --> 00:14:06,667
- Yeah she came in earlier,

173
00:14:06,667 --> 00:14:09,733
she was right down the
 hall, but she left.

174
00:14:13,633 --> 00:14:14,900
(the woman speaks Spanish)

175
00:14:15,133 --> 00:14:16,633
- I need a ticket
 to Piedras Negras.

176
00:14:16,633 --> 00:14:17,967
Next available.

177
00:14:20,467 --> 00:14:22,600
- The next one is boarding
 now, is that okay?

178
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,967
- Yeah, that's fine.

179
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,533
- Any luggage?

180
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:27,667
- No.

181
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:31,267
- Okay, your total
 is 32 dollars.

182
00:14:34,633 --> 00:14:37,233
Thank you for riding
 Don Luis Buslines.

183
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,767
- [Driver] Hey, welcome aboard.

184
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:42,367
Thank you.

185
00:14:42,433 --> 00:14:43,700
Welcome aboard.

186
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:50,467
Bienvenidos, welcome aboard.

187
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,333
Thank you, welcome aboard.

188
00:14:57,667 --> 00:14:59,133
Is everyone on board?

189
00:14:59,567 --> 00:15:04,167
(foreboding music)

190
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:25,600
- Hey, what's wrong?

191
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:30,600
- Uhm, I think I'm just...

192
00:15:32,933 --> 00:15:35,433
I'm just worried about
 the future, you know.

193
00:15:37,167 --> 00:15:40,833
It's like I can't visualize it.

194
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:44,900
You know what I mean?

195
00:15:45,167 --> 00:15:50,167
- Okay, you just need
 to relax, breathe.

196
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,233
And take it easy.

197
00:15:53,767 --> 00:15:55,600
Tell me what's really going on.

198
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:59,067
Is this because of Alex?

199
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,500
Did he call?

200
00:16:03,067 --> 00:16:04,067
- Yeah.

201
00:16:04,067 --> 00:16:06,500
- And, what did you say?

202
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,133
- I didn't answer.

203
00:16:09,433 --> 00:16:12,367
- What, why what happened?

204
00:16:12,367 --> 00:16:17,133
- Because it's like,
 when we broke up,

205
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:21,633
I walked away and
 he walked away.

206
00:16:22,367 --> 00:16:26,500
And he didn't even
 turn around to see if

207
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,500
there was some sort of
 reconciliation, you know.

208
00:16:31,433 --> 00:16:34,167
It's like when you
 really love someone,

209
00:16:34,167 --> 00:16:37,433
you turn around to see if
 they're still there and...

210
00:16:38,767 --> 00:16:40,767
He just kept walking.

211
00:16:42,567 --> 00:16:45,567
- Your life is no
 romantic Hollywood movie.

212
00:16:46,133 --> 00:16:47,900
I've never met or
 heard of anyone

213
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,900
that that actually happened to.

214
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,800
I mean, love isn't real.

215
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,967
Wake up Mila.

216
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,767
It's just a four letter word

217
00:16:57,767 --> 00:17:00,733
that people use to
 get married and laid.

218
00:17:02,067 --> 00:17:04,300
It's so powerful,
 but it just becomes

219
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:06,467
overused and meaningless.

220
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:09,267
- I guess you're right, I
 mean who knows if someone

221
00:17:09,267 --> 00:17:11,900
is really being honest
 with you, right?

222
00:17:12,867 --> 00:17:15,300
It's like the moment
 someone lays eyes on you,

223
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:18,067
their lies immediately start.

224
00:17:18,567 --> 00:17:20,467
I really felt like I...

225
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:23,933
I thought it was real.

226
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:27,367
- Hey, something for
 all that one person,

227
00:17:27,367 --> 00:17:30,167
won't ever change the way
 that they perceive love.

228
00:17:31,067 --> 00:17:32,533
- Yeah, I see why.

229
00:17:32,733 --> 00:17:34,367
- Then give up on it.

230
00:17:34,567 --> 00:17:36,233
They think everyone
 is out to get them

231
00:17:36,233 --> 00:17:37,300
and to use them.

232
00:17:39,633 --> 00:17:41,067
- Yeah, you're right.

233
00:17:41,867 --> 00:17:45,100
I've been busting my ass
for years already, so...

234
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,767
New York City, here we come.

235
00:17:50,133 --> 00:17:52,333
You know, it's just, it's
 not like he can't come,

236
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:55,833
you know, he just
 didn't want to, so...

237
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,433
- That's because you
 two are incompatible.

238
00:18:00,067 --> 00:18:02,067
You don't like
anything that he likes.

239
00:18:02,267 --> 00:18:05,500
He's way too chilled and
 you are so freaking uptight.

240
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,300
I mean who's the one
 who's always getting angry

241
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:09,433
when he doesn't have a
 plan for the evening?

242
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,067
Sometimes you just overreact.

243
00:18:13,267 --> 00:18:14,733
- And you don't?

244
00:18:15,067 --> 00:18:17,300
- Me, I'm perfect.

245
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,200
- All we ever do is
 fighting anyways,

246
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:25,067
so in a way I'm kinda
 glad we broke up.

247
00:18:25,267 --> 00:18:27,767
- Hey, I know you're
better off without him.

248
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:32,433
You know I have to go.

249
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:34,067
- Already?

250
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:35,767
- I know...

251
00:18:35,767 --> 00:18:37,600
There's just something
 I've been wanting to say.

252
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,067
- What?

253
00:18:40,133 --> 00:18:42,900
- I'm glad you finally found
 the courage to leave Alex.

254
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,133
- Why?

255
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,133
- Because he's a loser.

256
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:47,700
- Stop.

257
00:18:48,533 --> 00:18:50,067
- He's not going anywhere.

258
00:18:50,067 --> 00:18:51,933
If his parents
 didn't have money...

259
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,667
Too soon?

260
00:18:53,967 --> 00:18:55,233
- Maybe a bit.

261
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,633
- Gonna miss you.

262
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:00,233
- Gonna miss you too, thanks.

263
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,067
Why did you change
 your voicemail?

264
00:19:03,067 --> 00:19:05,733
I got your call last
 night, I wanted to call you

265
00:19:05,733 --> 00:19:08,133
but figured you would be out.

266
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:13,200
I really wanted to see
 you, so we can talk.

267
00:19:14,633 --> 00:19:17,700
But I guess it's too late
 now and I gotta be up early.

268
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:21,133
Uhm, I'll be stopping
 by my mom's house,

269
00:19:21,133 --> 00:19:24,600
so you can call me there.

270
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:38,200
(foreboding music)

271
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:57,667
- How long 'till we get there?

272
00:19:58,767 --> 00:20:00,300
I'm fucking tired.

273
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,800
- Chill out, alright.

274
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,233
Your face and mine are
 all over the news by now.

275
00:20:04,233 --> 00:20:06,300
I'm not going to risk
it and go back to prison

276
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:08,300
with all those fucking pussies.

277
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,767
- Damn Skippy.

278
00:20:14,667 --> 00:20:15,833
- [Distorted radio]
 A patient has escaped

279
00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:17,733
from a Colorado
 psychiatric ward.

280
00:20:17,733 --> 00:20:19,500
Later an informant
 led police officers

281
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:23,000
to a house in Grand Junction
 where two women were killed.

282
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,933
Due to the graphic
nature of the killings,

283
00:20:24,933 --> 00:20:26,800
they were believed
 to be in connection

284
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,700
with the escaped patient.

285
00:20:29,067 --> 00:20:32,000
Subsequent information
 from investigators reveals

286
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,433
a grisly message was left at
 the crime scene by the killer.

287
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,000
(anticipating music)

288
00:21:50,833 --> 00:21:52,067
- Hey.

289
00:21:52,667 --> 00:21:54,300
What took you all so
long, you were supposed

290
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:55,800
to be here yesterday.

291
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,567
- Shit doesn't
 always go as planned.

292
00:21:57,567 --> 00:22:01,633
- Hey Gam, you're
 blazed, gimme some.

293
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,933
- Go ahead, you just
 have to spark it.

294
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:10,933
- Fuck.

295
00:22:17,267 --> 00:22:20,967
(car electronics beeping)

296
00:22:20,967 --> 00:22:22,400
Shit.

297
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:43,900
- Help...

298
00:22:46,067 --> 00:22:47,433
- What the fuck?

299
00:22:49,133 --> 00:22:49,967
(gunshot)

300
00:22:49,967 --> 00:22:52,967
- Mommy, mommy, mommy...

301
00:22:53,667 --> 00:22:58,533
(ominous music)

302
00:23:10,733 --> 00:23:12,233
(faint crying baby)

303
00:23:29,067 --> 00:23:30,333
- Yeah, can I help you?

304
00:23:30,433 --> 00:23:33,067
- Yes, my car is completely
 dead down the road.

305
00:23:33,067 --> 00:23:34,667
Could you please
give me a boost?

306
00:23:34,667 --> 00:23:36,633
I mean I've got all the
wires and everything.

307
00:23:36,633 --> 00:23:39,800
- Ah, yeah well I don't
 wanna seem rude or anything,

308
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,233
but, you know, we're
 kind of in the middle

309
00:23:41,233 --> 00:23:42,800
of making dinner and
getting the kids to bed.

310
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,733
- I'm sorry, but could
 you please help me,

311
00:23:44,733 --> 00:23:46,733
all I need is a boost, sir.

312
00:23:46,733 --> 00:23:49,067
Like, the thing is, I have
 a really important flight

313
00:23:49,067 --> 00:23:51,500
to catch for a job
 in New York City.

314
00:23:52,067 --> 00:23:53,267
Pretty please?

315
00:23:53,267 --> 00:23:54,733
- Yeah I guess if
 you wanna come on in

316
00:23:54,733 --> 00:23:56,500
and make a phone call, you
 can call yourself a cab.

317
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:57,967
Guess that'd be okay.

318
00:23:57,967 --> 00:23:59,133
- Okay.

319
00:24:03,867 --> 00:24:08,867
(ominous music)

320
00:24:19,967 --> 00:24:24,967
(crying baby)

321
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:42,067
(struggling and groaning)

322
00:24:42,733 --> 00:24:47,500
(anticipating music)

323
00:24:55,167 --> 00:25:00,100
(whimpering)

324
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:13,067
(crying)

325
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,433
- [Mila] (shouting) Help!

326
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:21,067
Help!

327
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:29,467
Help me, please help me,
 I've just been kidnapped,

328
00:25:29,467 --> 00:25:31,267
please, there's a
 house up the hill,

329
00:25:31,267 --> 00:25:32,933
they have a baby I
don't think it's theirs,

330
00:25:32,933 --> 00:25:34,833
please help me.

331
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,967
Please, (blurting out words)...

332
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:39,700
Ah, ah!

333
00:25:40,733 --> 00:25:45,067
(anticipating music)

334
00:25:56,833 --> 00:25:59,567
- Ah man, get that
 bitch outta here.

335
00:26:05,067 --> 00:26:10,067
(foreboding music)

336
00:26:39,867 --> 00:26:41,267
- Yeah, how can I help you?

337
00:26:41,267 --> 00:26:44,067
- My daughter Mila has
 been missing for 24 hours.

338
00:26:44,067 --> 00:26:46,200
Her car is just a mile away.

339
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:48,167
Have you seen her?

340
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,133
- Well you know ma'am,
we uh, live pretty close

341
00:26:51,133 --> 00:26:53,433
to the desert, so you know,

342
00:26:53,433 --> 00:26:55,900
people go missing
every week around here.

343
00:26:56,833 --> 00:27:00,133
- Well would you take another
 look please at the picture?

344
00:27:00,733 --> 00:27:02,233
And call me if you see her?

345
00:27:02,233 --> 00:27:04,767
- Yeah, yeah, I'll do that.

346
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,500
- Hello?

347
00:27:20,767 --> 00:27:21,800
Hello?!

348
00:27:23,067 --> 00:27:28,067
(anticipating music)

349
00:27:38,933 --> 00:27:41,133
(gasps) Mila, Mila!

350
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:45,267
Oh baby, Mila, Mila
 come on, come on Mila,

351
00:27:45,267 --> 00:27:47,200
it's okay, it's okay,
 sweetie it's okay.

352
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,367
(crying and whimpering)

353
00:27:49,367 --> 00:27:52,633
Baby it's mommy, mommy,
mommy, baby, it's mommy,

354
00:27:52,633 --> 00:27:54,100
you're going to be
 okay, no, no, no,

355
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:57,067
sweetie it's okay,
 going to be okay.

356
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,567
- Hey!

357
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:01,900
What the fuck are you doing?

358
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,567
Wanna join the party bitch, huh?

359
00:28:07,567 --> 00:28:09,133
- Fuck you.

360
00:28:09,133 --> 00:28:12,633
- Yeah, that's
 right, let's do it.

361
00:28:12,833 --> 00:28:15,067
(screaming)

362
00:28:16,533 --> 00:28:21,167
(foreboding music)

363
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:46,900
- You do realize we're
 going to my parents, right?

364
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:48,367
- And?

365
00:28:48,367 --> 00:28:50,433
- I asked you to
 wear something decent

366
00:28:50,433 --> 00:28:51,867
and you come out in this.

367
00:28:51,867 --> 00:28:53,500
- Oh who cares.

368
00:28:53,767 --> 00:28:56,467
And this is stupid,
 we always fight.

369
00:28:56,667 --> 00:28:59,733
- Yeah, well if only you
didn't give me a reason.

370
00:29:26,967 --> 00:29:28,633
- Where's your restroom?

371
00:29:28,967 --> 00:29:30,633
- Over there, ma'am.

372
00:29:52,433 --> 00:29:53,367
(gunshot)

373
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,533
(choking)

374
00:30:05,867 --> 00:30:09,533
- Well, well, well,
 look what I found.

375
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:12,200
A little mousey in
 the cat house huh?

376
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,367
- Please, please
 don't kill me, please.

377
00:30:13,367 --> 00:30:15,200
- [Bald man] Oh
 shut the fuck up!

378
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:19,433
(choking)

379
00:30:19,433 --> 00:30:20,567
- [Preppy guy] Here
 you take my wallet--

380
00:30:20,567 --> 00:30:22,167
- Get the fuck outta
 here with that.

381
00:30:22,167 --> 00:30:23,400
- Please, don't kill me, please.

382
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,600
- I want your keys, give
me your fucking keys.

383
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:25,867
- Here, just take
 it please, just...

384
00:30:25,867 --> 00:30:27,267
- Where's that bitch
 you walked in with?

385
00:30:27,267 --> 00:30:28,667
- I don't know.

386
00:30:28,667 --> 00:30:29,667
- Where's that fucking bitch
 you walked in with huh?

387
00:30:29,667 --> 00:30:30,567
- I don't...

388
00:30:30,567 --> 00:30:32,067
- Don't fucking lie to me.

389
00:30:32,067 --> 00:30:33,567
What are you crying for, what
 the fuck is wrong with you?

390
00:30:33,567 --> 00:30:34,767
- Please don't...

391
00:30:34,767 --> 00:30:36,533
- Please don't what,
 please don't what?

392
00:30:36,533 --> 00:30:37,233
- Please don't kill me.

393
00:30:37,233 --> 00:30:38,167
- Huh?!

394
00:30:39,133 --> 00:30:40,100
- Please...

395
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:40,667
- [Bald man] You little bitch.

396
00:30:40,667 --> 00:30:41,300
- No...

397
00:30:42,567 --> 00:30:44,067
(gunshot)

398
00:30:44,167 --> 00:30:47,467
- Six whole fucking dollars
 man, you gotta be shitting me.

399
00:30:51,733 --> 00:30:52,700
- What did I miss?

400
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:54,300
- What the fuck are you doing?

401
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:56,700
What are you, what is
 this with this girl?

402
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:58,533
- I was just gonna show you.

403
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:01,533
- And what the fuck
were you gonna show me?

404
00:31:01,533 --> 00:31:03,067
- Tada.

405
00:31:03,067 --> 00:31:05,300
- I'm over here putting in
 work, getting money for us

406
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:08,400
and you're in there fucking
 killing bitches, that's great.

407
00:31:09,233 --> 00:31:10,467
- Would you prefer I
 put them in the trunk,

408
00:31:10,467 --> 00:31:11,633
take them for a joyride?

409
00:31:11,633 --> 00:31:13,533
- You better watch
 your mouth boy.

410
00:31:14,067 --> 00:31:15,933
You know the only reason
I came out this way

411
00:31:15,933 --> 00:31:17,167
was to get Hersey.

412
00:31:17,167 --> 00:31:19,700
- Oh and that was a
brilliant fucking idea.

413
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:21,567
Let's go get psycho bitch
 from the mental hospital,

414
00:31:21,567 --> 00:31:23,600
that won't attract attention.

415
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:28,200
Where are we going?

416
00:31:28,967 --> 00:31:30,500
I'm not going back
 to Fieldhouse.

417
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:32,067
- Oh-ho, yes you are.

418
00:31:32,067 --> 00:31:33,133
- No.

419
00:31:33,867 --> 00:31:34,967
No.

420
00:31:35,567 --> 00:31:37,700
- [Bald man] Hersey,
 let's go baby.

421
00:31:42,533 --> 00:31:47,533
(ominous music)

422
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,333
Shut the fuck up.

423
00:32:08,333 --> 00:32:13,200
(crying and whimpering)

424
00:32:14,167 --> 00:32:17,067
(psychotic laughter)

425
00:32:24,467 --> 00:32:29,133
(heavy breathing and whimpering)

426
00:32:34,667 --> 00:32:37,300
You're still crying, huh, hmmm?

427
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:38,533
(screaming)

428
00:32:38,533 --> 00:32:41,167
Shut the fuck up, shut
 the fucking fuck up.

429
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:42,433
You hear me?

430
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:44,733
You wanna scream, go ahead...

431
00:32:44,733 --> 00:32:47,267
Go ahead, scream,
 it won't matter.

432
00:32:48,067 --> 00:32:50,567
You're mine, bitch,
 you understand me?

433
00:32:50,867 --> 00:32:52,600
You'll be going when
 I tell you to go.

434
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,833
Stand up, stand up.

435
00:32:53,833 --> 00:32:58,767
(screaming and whimpering)

436
00:33:06,767 --> 00:33:08,833
What the fuck is wrong with
 you, you fucking bitch!

437
00:33:08,833 --> 00:33:13,800
(thrilling music and screaming)

438
00:33:17,433 --> 00:33:20,467
- (shouting) Help,
 no please, help me!

439
00:33:20,467 --> 00:33:25,233
(screaming)

440
00:33:51,833 --> 00:33:55,967
(coughing)

441
00:33:57,967 --> 00:33:59,567
- You're done.

442
00:34:04,467 --> 00:34:06,567
I wish I could just kill you.

443
00:34:07,433 --> 00:34:08,867
Right now (spits).

444
00:34:09,567 --> 00:34:12,533
- Stop, please...

445
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:14,733
- Look at you.

446
00:34:16,167 --> 00:34:18,067
You're disgusting.

447
00:34:19,767 --> 00:34:23,533
Too bad Dale is keeping
you as his little pet.

448
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:28,467
(screaming)

449
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:34,167
- Oh you fucking bitch, I'm
 gonna fucking kill you...

450
00:34:35,267 --> 00:34:38,867
- Oh no, you ain't.

451
00:34:40,833 --> 00:34:42,300
Now listen up.

452
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:46,067
I need your to shut your mouth

453
00:34:46,067 --> 00:34:48,767
and don't scream.

454
00:34:50,967 --> 00:34:53,167
Cause we're having
 guests tonight.

455
00:34:56,067 --> 00:34:58,567
What's up, what are you doing?

456
00:34:58,567 --> 00:35:00,600
- [Dale] Watching a little TV.

457
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,800
The fuck are you so happy for?

458
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,833
- What, can't a girl be smiling

459
00:35:04,833 --> 00:35:07,500
and cheerful in her own house?

460
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:09,300
- Not without my
 permission, baby.

461
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:11,567
- (deep voice) Not without
 my permission, baby.

462
00:35:12,433 --> 00:35:13,633
I'm glad I'm back home.

463
00:35:13,633 --> 00:35:14,300
- [Dale] Yeah?

464
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:15,467
- [Hersey] Uhuh.

465
00:35:16,333 --> 00:35:17,933
- [Dale] I'm glad
 you're back too.

466
00:35:17,933 --> 00:35:20,133
- So who comes up with all this?

467
00:35:20,933 --> 00:35:22,767
- Hollywood, duh.

468
00:35:26,067 --> 00:35:27,667
- I like Godfather.

469
00:35:28,267 --> 00:35:30,700
But there's just too
 much shit out there, man.

470
00:35:30,867 --> 00:35:33,233
- Now see that's just a
medium to get the dough.

471
00:35:33,233 --> 00:35:35,533
See, it's all about the money.

472
00:35:36,067 --> 00:35:39,067
It's like a waitress,
 if she goes to work,

473
00:35:39,067 --> 00:35:40,367
she gets that money.

474
00:35:40,367 --> 00:35:41,533
Of course you wouldn't
know nothing about that

475
00:35:41,533 --> 00:35:43,567
since your ass ain't
 never had a job.

476
00:35:44,067 --> 00:35:45,567
- Ah, shut up!

477
00:35:45,567 --> 00:35:47,067
You're such a fucking
 asshole to think

478
00:35:47,067 --> 00:35:50,533
I don't get stupid demented
 shit like that, fuck!

479
00:35:56,333 --> 00:35:57,500
- Come on.

480
00:35:58,300 --> 00:35:59,767
Don't be mad.

481
00:36:01,067 --> 00:36:02,900
You know I read the article.

482
00:36:03,233 --> 00:36:04,700
- Yeah, yeah.

483
00:36:06,167 --> 00:36:08,767
- Let's get daddy a
 little sugar, hmm?

484
00:36:15,133 --> 00:36:20,133
(faint electronic music)

485
00:36:36,067 --> 00:36:37,267
- What's up?

486
00:36:53,867 --> 00:36:57,433
- Her over there, she
 just snorted cocaine.

487
00:36:59,333 --> 00:37:02,067
- Nah, nah, nah, her.

488
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:05,067
She looks good, she
 looks real good.

489
00:37:08,067 --> 00:37:08,833
Hey?

490
00:37:08,833 --> 00:37:09,500
- Hmm?

491
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:11,067
- You good?

492
00:37:11,067 --> 00:37:12,700
- Yeah, I'm good.

493
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:17,067
- You ready to do the
 devil's work, baby?

494
00:37:18,333 --> 00:37:21,167
- Okay, just like we planned?

495
00:37:22,533 --> 00:37:26,067
See I like this,
 it's like were spies.

496
00:37:26,333 --> 00:37:28,233
We're undercover agents.

497
00:37:28,833 --> 00:37:30,133
- What the fuck?

498
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:35,733
(door opening and slamming shut)

499
00:37:36,367 --> 00:37:38,767
(foreboding music and footsteps)

500
00:37:38,767 --> 00:37:41,933
(distant mumbling and grumbling)

501
00:37:41,933 --> 00:37:46,267
(laughter)

502
00:37:46,267 --> 00:37:51,067
(coughing)

503
00:37:55,567 --> 00:37:57,533
You know what, to be
 honest, I'm not too happy

504
00:37:57,533 --> 00:37:58,800
with tonight's prize.

505
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,200
- Well if you were
 a little less weird,

506
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,600
then we might have hooked
 up with that other chick.

507
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:08,300
- Where's my money?

508
00:38:08,633 --> 00:38:10,367
- It's in the other room.

509
00:38:10,633 --> 00:38:13,533
But you should wash up first.

510
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:14,867
- Sure.

511
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,933
Nazdrovje...

512
00:38:24,267 --> 00:38:28,133
You're so fucking hot baby.

513
00:38:29,733 --> 00:38:31,767
I'm so ready...

514
00:38:32,367 --> 00:38:34,067
Can you do me first?

515
00:38:34,067 --> 00:38:38,833
(laughter)

516
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:41,467
- [Hersey] That's
 far enough, bitch.

517
00:38:41,867 --> 00:38:43,767
Is she really dancing?

518
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:46,500
(laughter)

519
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:48,333
You stupid bitch!

520
00:38:48,333 --> 00:38:48,967
Get that bitch.

521
00:38:48,967 --> 00:38:49,867
(groaning)

522
00:38:49,867 --> 00:38:51,233
- [Dale] Sit your ass down.

523
00:38:51,233 --> 00:38:55,067
You walked into the devil's
 room and you will pay.

524
00:38:58,367 --> 00:39:00,667
- [Hersey] You
 wanna fuck, bitch?

525
00:39:01,767 --> 00:39:06,533
(groaning and screaming)

526
00:39:14,567 --> 00:39:16,367
Stank ass whore!

527
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:21,100
(shrieking and screaming)

528
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:23,633
Bitch, fucking whore.

529
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:27,967
You got blood all over me.

530
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:44,633
- [Dale] Hey.

531
00:39:47,333 --> 00:39:49,333
I got some breakfast for you.

532
00:39:50,367 --> 00:39:51,800
- I'm thirsty.

533
00:39:52,067 --> 00:39:54,233
- You have to ask me nicely.

534
00:39:54,233 --> 00:39:56,700
- Please, I'm hungry...

535
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:58,200
- I can't hear you!

536
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,133
- Please, please...

537
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,633
- I can't...

538
00:40:04,967 --> 00:40:07,000
- Come on you fucking...

539
00:40:08,033 --> 00:40:08,667
Here.

540
00:40:08,667 --> 00:40:09,433
(grunting)

541
00:40:09,433 --> 00:40:11,067
You fucking bitch!

542
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:15,233
- [Hersey] What the
 hell is going on here?

543
00:40:15,767 --> 00:40:17,567
Oh you bitch!

544
00:40:17,833 --> 00:40:20,667
(thumping, groaning and moaning)

545
00:40:20,733 --> 00:40:25,733
(sad music)

546
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:34,833
(panting and heaving)

547
00:40:34,833 --> 00:40:35,700
- Ssshht, ssshht, ssshht...

548
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:36,633
- [Woman] No please...

549
00:40:36,633 --> 00:40:41,133
- Ssshht, ssshht, ssshht...

550
00:40:41,133 --> 00:40:46,067
- [Woman] Please let me
go, let me go, please...

551
00:40:46,067 --> 00:40:48,267
What are you doing, what
are, what are you doing?

552
00:40:48,267 --> 00:40:49,367
- [Dale] Don't
 worry, don't worry.

553
00:40:49,367 --> 00:40:50,567
- No, no...

554
00:40:50,567 --> 00:40:53,933
- Shut your mouth,
 shut your mouth.

555
00:40:53,933 --> 00:40:58,933
(screaming)

556
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:16,067
(mumbling and laughter)

557
00:41:20,233 --> 00:41:23,200
- [Hersey] Hey, you
 want another beer?

558
00:41:45,167 --> 00:41:46,233
- Hey you.

559
00:41:47,133 --> 00:41:48,533
Ssshht, ssshht, ssshht...

560
00:41:48,533 --> 00:41:52,500
Hey, hey, don't cry, don't cry.

561
00:41:53,567 --> 00:41:57,233
- (whimpering) What's that, no,
please, please, no please...

562
00:41:57,233 --> 00:42:00,167
- Hey, listen to
 me, listen to me!

563
00:42:01,067 --> 00:42:04,567
Alright, don't say a
word, don't say a word,

564
00:42:04,567 --> 00:42:06,467
you understand me?

565
00:42:06,467 --> 00:42:07,367
Shut your mouth.

566
00:42:07,367 --> 00:42:10,133
(whimpering and crying)

567
00:42:10,533 --> 00:42:12,867
Ssshht, ssshht, ssshht...

568
00:42:12,867 --> 00:42:17,867
(screaming)

569
00:42:39,333 --> 00:42:40,533
- Get in.

570
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,067
Get in!

571
00:42:49,633 --> 00:42:54,067
(whimpering and crying)

572
00:43:01,233 --> 00:43:04,633
Sit, sit!

573
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:28,833
You're not even that pretty.

574
00:43:31,667 --> 00:43:35,933
It's not like
 you're fucking, hmm?

575
00:43:37,933 --> 00:43:39,133
- [Mila] You should let me go.

576
00:43:39,133 --> 00:43:42,567
- Plus, I'm better
 looking than you.

577
00:43:44,067 --> 00:43:47,533
- [Mila] Just, just
 let me go, please...

578
00:43:50,133 --> 00:43:53,267
- [Hersey] No, no no.

579
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:57,900
He'll eventually get
 tired of you, sweetie.

580
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:06,333
- I promise I won't
 tell anyone, please...

581
00:44:07,167 --> 00:44:09,467
No one will ever find out...

582
00:44:11,367 --> 00:44:12,533
Please...

583
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:14,333
- [Hersey] No.

584
00:44:16,733 --> 00:44:18,733
We're just getting started.

585
00:44:20,333 --> 00:44:22,067
We're gonna kill you

586
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:27,300
over and over

587
00:44:28,633 --> 00:44:32,167
and over again.

588
00:44:32,233 --> 00:44:37,067
(whimpering and crying)

589
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:46,967
- [Dale] What the fuck?

590
00:44:46,967 --> 00:44:48,433
- [Hersey] There's
 a show tonight.

591
00:44:48,533 --> 00:44:50,500
- First of all, you wanna
 take your foot off the table?

592
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:51,933
(Dale is eclipsed by
 the creaking wood)

593
00:44:52,367 --> 00:44:53,967
- There's a show tonight.

594
00:44:54,767 --> 00:44:55,533
- And?

595
00:44:55,533 --> 00:44:57,333
- And I wanna go.

596
00:44:57,333 --> 00:44:59,167
- You wanna go where?

597
00:44:59,167 --> 00:45:01,300
- To the show, tonight.

598
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:02,933
- We're not going anywhere.

599
00:45:03,433 --> 00:45:04,400
- So we're gonna stay here?

600
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:05,533
- That's right, boo-fucking-hoo,

601
00:45:05,533 --> 00:45:06,733
we're staying right here.

602
00:45:06,733 --> 00:45:08,467
- We're gonna stay
 here, with that girl?

603
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,167
- [Dale] That's exactly right.

604
00:45:10,167 --> 00:45:11,500
- [Hersey] With your
 fucking friend, that girl.

605
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:12,967
- [Dale] We're not
 having this conversation.

606
00:45:12,967 --> 00:45:15,400
- You're damn right I'm not
having a conversation fuck this.

607
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:17,167
- Hey!

608
00:45:17,733 --> 00:45:19,367
Alright fine man.

609
00:45:20,267 --> 00:45:21,533
Alright fine.

610
00:45:22,067 --> 00:45:23,867
You're gonna go,
 I'll go with you.

611
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:34,767
(grunting and screaming)

612
00:45:35,967 --> 00:45:40,967
(anticipating music)

613
00:46:30,333 --> 00:46:32,867
- [Voiceover] Well,
 you're finally up huh?

614
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:37,367
You know you were out for
 almost 30-something hours,

615
00:46:37,367 --> 00:46:39,900
you're lucky I didn't
 have no appointments.

616
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:41,367
What happened,
 your man beat you?

617
00:46:41,367 --> 00:46:42,567
(door knocking)

618
00:46:42,567 --> 00:46:43,600
Yeah hold on!

619
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:44,500
Give me a minute.

620
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:46,400
I said hold the fuck on!

621
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:48,167
Finally coming over here
acting like I got time

622
00:46:48,167 --> 00:46:49,567
to deal with them.

623
00:46:49,567 --> 00:46:52,467
Well come on in this house,
 just don't slam my door.

624
00:46:52,467 --> 00:46:53,933
Shit!

625
00:46:54,067 --> 00:46:56,333
Everybody always be coming
 around here slamming my door,

626
00:46:56,333 --> 00:46:57,800
shaking my house and everything.

627
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:00,800
- I'm sorry Octavia, alright
look I was just passing through

628
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:02,667
to check up on what we
talked about yesterday.

629
00:47:02,667 --> 00:47:04,567
- Hmm-mm, I'm listening.

630
00:47:05,467 --> 00:47:06,800
- Is she cool?

631
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:08,067
Should I come back later?

632
00:47:08,067 --> 00:47:09,633
- Nah, she cool.

633
00:47:09,633 --> 00:47:11,300
Boy you go on and
 tell me why you here,

634
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:12,833
and you better be
 trying to talk me into

635
00:47:12,833 --> 00:47:15,233
giving your sister
 some kind of discount.

636
00:47:15,233 --> 00:47:18,067
Because if you is, you may
 as well walk on outta here.

637
00:47:18,067 --> 00:47:21,933
Now my going rate is 50
 dollars, no more, no less.

638
00:47:21,933 --> 00:47:24,767
You get the money, bring your
 sister over and it's done.

639
00:47:24,767 --> 00:47:26,500
I don't need nobody
 coming around here

640
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:29,400
trying to talk me into
some kind of price cut.

641
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:31,167
Boy you better pawn some
of those video games

642
00:47:31,167 --> 00:47:34,067
or sell something,
 cause like I said,

643
00:47:34,067 --> 00:47:36,567
my price ain't changing.

644
00:47:36,567 --> 00:47:39,700
- Hah, it's a funny
 story I tell ya.

645
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:42,867
See what happened
 was, I got 20 dollars.

646
00:47:42,867 --> 00:47:44,300
- [Octavia] Boy get your
broke ass outta here,

647
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:45,933
I gotta deal with her now,
 get your ass outta here.

648
00:47:45,933 --> 00:47:47,367
- But, but, I got a microwave
 with an oven, it's brand new.

649
00:47:47,367 --> 00:47:48,533
- [Octavia] I don't give
 a fuck about no microwave,

650
00:47:48,533 --> 00:47:50,233
you better take your
 ass and get a job.

651
00:47:50,233 --> 00:47:52,767
Motherfucker, ain't nobody
 got time to deal with him.

652
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:55,500
It's business, not personal.

653
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:58,533
I don't care who you
 are, no compromise.

654
00:48:00,333 --> 00:48:01,933
- Do you have a
 phone I could use?

655
00:48:01,933 --> 00:48:04,133
- Hold on, before
 I lend you phone,

656
00:48:04,133 --> 00:48:06,067
you tell me what happened.

657
00:48:08,067 --> 00:48:11,867
- I, I've been held
 against my own will.

658
00:48:12,233 --> 00:48:13,133
I need to contact the police.

659
00:48:13,133 --> 00:48:14,667
- Nah-ah, not with my phone.

660
00:48:14,667 --> 00:48:16,533
Girl I don't need no
 heat or nobody else

661
00:48:16,533 --> 00:48:18,067
coming around here
 investigating.

662
00:48:18,067 --> 00:48:21,233
Sitting on my couch, expecting
 coffee and fucking cookies.

663
00:48:21,233 --> 00:48:22,767
Look around.

664
00:48:23,067 --> 00:48:24,833
Now there's a pay
 phone downstairs,

665
00:48:24,833 --> 00:48:26,567
you can call from there.

666
00:48:29,133 --> 00:48:31,833
- I was screaming for
 days, I know somebody

667
00:48:31,833 --> 00:48:33,267
must have heard me and I could
 hear everything outside...

668
00:48:33,267 --> 00:48:37,233
(laughter)

669
00:48:37,233 --> 00:48:40,433
- Girl, you just ain't from
 around here, that's all.

670
00:48:40,633 --> 00:48:43,133
Now maybe where you
 from, rich folks got cops

671
00:48:43,133 --> 00:48:44,733
at their fingertips.

672
00:48:44,733 --> 00:48:47,200
But around here,
 cops only swing by

673
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:48,733
when there are dead bodies,

674
00:48:48,733 --> 00:48:51,667
and I bet you they ain't gonna
 do nothing about this either.

675
00:48:52,067 --> 00:48:53,533
This ain't weird.

676
00:48:53,667 --> 00:48:55,700
A woman screaming?

677
00:48:57,067 --> 00:48:59,900
Girl they ain't coming
 around here for that.

678
00:49:00,567 --> 00:49:04,967
But you know, my momma might
 have a place for you to stay.

679
00:49:05,167 --> 00:49:07,267
She owns this strip
 club and the old girl,

680
00:49:07,267 --> 00:49:09,433
who just moved out, was
renting a room there.

681
00:49:09,433 --> 00:49:11,667
She might be cool with
you using her phone too,

682
00:49:11,667 --> 00:49:14,300
I don't know, you
 can ask for that.

683
00:49:27,133 --> 00:49:30,367
- Well, come on in.

684
00:49:30,667 --> 00:49:32,900
I just got off the
 phone with Octavia.

685
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:36,133
What happened to you?

686
00:49:37,067 --> 00:49:38,167
- Look, I don't
 want to burden you,

687
00:49:38,167 --> 00:49:39,800
I'm sorry, I'm just gonna go.

688
00:49:39,967 --> 00:49:41,600
- Where are you gonna go?

689
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:44,867
And if you had somewhere you
 would've been there by now.

690
00:49:45,233 --> 00:49:49,067
You're no burden, but if
 you wanna leave, go ahead.

691
00:49:50,833 --> 00:49:55,100
I'm cooking, I gotta
go check on this pasta.

692
00:49:55,100 --> 00:49:56,867
I think it's ready.

693
00:49:57,933 --> 00:49:59,400
You hungry?

694
00:50:00,067 --> 00:50:00,933
- Yes.

695
00:50:01,267 --> 00:50:02,767
- Come on baby.

696
00:50:09,633 --> 00:50:10,900
Go ahead.

697
00:50:13,333 --> 00:50:16,833
(sad music)

698
00:50:17,333 --> 00:50:18,867
What happened to you?

699
00:50:21,067 --> 00:50:22,533
Where you from?

700
00:50:24,033 --> 00:50:25,200
You ain't from around here

701
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:27,767
cause I ain't ever
 seen you before.

702
00:50:29,267 --> 00:50:30,567
- I'm from Utah.

703
00:50:31,533 --> 00:50:33,600
- What you doing around here?

704
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:36,400
- I don't know.

705
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,100
- Now who's done this to you?

706
00:50:41,533 --> 00:50:43,367
- I was kidnapped.

707
00:50:45,267 --> 00:50:48,433
By this strange couple

708
00:50:48,433 --> 00:50:51,867
and this white guy.

709
00:50:54,433 --> 00:50:56,067
I don't know who they were,

710
00:50:56,067 --> 00:50:58,767
I've never seen
 before in my life.

711
00:51:02,567 --> 00:51:04,467
But I may be able to find out.

712
00:51:09,333 --> 00:51:11,067
I took this book.

713
00:51:13,467 --> 00:51:15,733
- Is there anybody
 you need to call?

714
00:51:17,133 --> 00:51:18,767
Where is your momma?

715
00:51:23,233 --> 00:51:24,667
- They killed her.

716
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:33,267
- Nothing I can say can help you

717
00:51:33,267 --> 00:51:35,733
through what you
 just went through.

718
00:51:36,067 --> 00:51:37,633
Nor your loss.

719
00:51:38,700 --> 00:51:41,633
But those who done
 this need to pay.

720
00:51:42,067 --> 00:51:45,467
Whoever they are,
 they need to pay.

721
00:51:46,733 --> 00:51:49,467
I suppose you haven't
 reported this?

722
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:53,233
- I was going to, but...

723
00:51:54,067 --> 00:51:56,600
Octavia says she don't
 want anyone coming around.

724
00:51:58,467 --> 00:52:00,233
Especially the cops.

725
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:02,567
- Well she has a warrant
out and hadn't had

726
00:52:02,567 --> 00:52:04,467
time to pay it off.

727
00:52:05,267 --> 00:52:07,933
And I think she's just
 a little paranoid.

728
00:52:08,933 --> 00:52:11,533
But you can use my
 phone if you want to.

729
00:52:12,967 --> 00:52:17,400
I can even take you to
 the police department.

730
00:52:18,233 --> 00:52:21,067
- I just don't understand why
 they haven't been reported.

731
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:22,700
You know...

732
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:27,533
They killed three women.

733
00:52:29,833 --> 00:52:33,467
One every other day and
they were, they were...

734
00:52:34,067 --> 00:52:36,167
Meticulous to where
 they did and it's like

735
00:52:36,167 --> 00:52:37,767
they were programmed, you know,

736
00:52:37,767 --> 00:52:40,533
they knew exactly what to do.

737
00:52:43,067 --> 00:52:45,233
This could've
 happened to anyone.

738
00:52:48,633 --> 00:52:49,767
Why me?

739
00:52:56,767 --> 00:52:58,667
I just wanna make things right.

740
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:03,700
- Here in Texas the death
 penalty will serve them good.

741
00:53:04,267 --> 00:53:06,533
We just have to
 go file a report.

742
00:53:07,267 --> 00:53:08,667
- The court system
 won't just charge them

743
00:53:08,667 --> 00:53:11,200
with one puny offense
 of kidnapping.

744
00:53:12,667 --> 00:53:13,833
And one had just got out of

745
00:53:13,833 --> 00:53:15,633
the psychiatric
 ward in Colorado.

746
00:53:19,167 --> 00:53:22,100
My mother's body is
 somewhere in that desert.

747
00:53:26,067 --> 00:53:27,733
And then you'll have two
 different police deparments

748
00:53:27,733 --> 00:53:30,867
working together which usually
 never helps the case, so...

749
00:53:31,967 --> 00:53:33,167
No.

750
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:36,433
- I don't know nothing
 about that lingo.

751
00:53:37,967 --> 00:53:41,367
But you sound like you know
 what you talking about.

752
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:47,700
You survived, you made it out
 and you can change things.

753
00:53:49,633 --> 00:53:53,333
Don't want you to let these
 mean people change you baby.

754
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:57,900
Some people are just
 mad at the world.

755
00:54:01,367 --> 00:54:06,367
(sighs) Look, I got to
get ready to go to work.

756
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:11,400
But you have a place
 to stay for now.

757
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:16,200
Till you figure
 things out, okay?

758
00:54:18,467 --> 00:54:19,400
- Okay.

759
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:20,500
- [Octavia's mother] Alright.

760
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:36,667
(hip hop music)

761
00:54:51,933 --> 00:54:54,300
Now, here is your locker key.

762
00:54:55,867 --> 00:54:57,267
The old girl that
 lived in this room

763
00:54:57,267 --> 00:55:01,067
I'm about to show you, moved
 out about two weeks ago.

764
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:17,200
Old girl left some clothes here.

765
00:55:18,667 --> 00:55:20,600
You might be able to fit 'em.

766
00:55:21,667 --> 00:55:23,900
Yep, you might.

767
00:55:26,333 --> 00:55:28,500
- All I kept thinking was...

768
00:55:30,067 --> 00:55:31,900
I wasn't ready to die.

769
00:55:34,467 --> 00:55:36,667
That's all I kept thinking.

770
00:55:38,567 --> 00:55:43,567
Over and over and over.

771
00:55:44,133 --> 00:55:46,600
(sad music)

772
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:51,600
- Maybe, that gut feeling,
 was God lifting you up.

773
00:55:55,800 --> 00:56:00,067
I'll help you in whatever I can.

774
00:56:01,333 --> 00:56:03,767
You can stay as
 long as you need to.

775
00:56:07,667 --> 00:56:09,467
What you gonna do, baby?

776
00:56:12,567 --> 00:56:13,867
- I don't know.

777
00:56:16,933 --> 00:56:19,067
I just wanna forget about it.

778
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:25,667
- Let me tell you something.

779
00:56:29,367 --> 00:56:31,933
It was my birthday and I was--

780
00:56:31,933 --> 00:56:35,933
- This is Gem, she works here.

781
00:56:37,067 --> 00:56:39,300
So you'll see around a lot.

782
00:56:39,733 --> 00:56:42,433
She practically lives here.

783
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:47,933
- Well, I was at this bar, me
 and my guy just broke up, so,

784
00:56:48,267 --> 00:56:51,600
you know, I was
 there all by myself.

785
00:56:53,067 --> 00:56:55,133
I wanted to order a drink
 and pay for it myself

786
00:56:55,133 --> 00:56:59,533
when this guy just,
 buys it for me.

787
00:56:59,867 --> 00:57:02,500
Which I felt was
 kinda cute, you know.

788
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:06,833
Coming off an abusive, somewhat,
neglected relationship.

789
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:13,233
I looked at him, he
looked good, clean cut.

790
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:15,900
A break from the norm.

791
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:19,500
I was attracted because
he was so good looking.

792
00:57:20,167 --> 00:57:23,633
Like a, model or actor.

793
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:25,833
Could've been both.

794
00:57:26,833 --> 00:57:31,333
And again drinking,
 well, it was my birthday.

795
00:57:31,933 --> 00:57:34,100
And we ended up
 in his apartment.

796
00:57:36,967 --> 00:57:38,900
Like it happened so quickly.

797
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:43,167
He caught me off guard.

798
00:57:44,433 --> 00:57:46,267
I thought he was
 gonna give me a hug,

799
00:57:46,267 --> 00:57:48,067
but it was no hug.

800
00:57:50,833 --> 00:57:54,867
He was applying some
 type of, choke hold.

801
00:57:54,867 --> 00:57:57,967
I've never felt
 anything like it.

802
00:57:58,700 --> 00:58:03,167
When I say I lost air, I mean,
 I felt myself passing out.

803
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:08,500
I have a collapsed lung
 so I know it wasn't a hug.

804
00:58:08,933 --> 00:58:10,500
It was pure evil.

805
00:58:12,267 --> 00:58:14,433
He showed no remorse.

806
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:17,900
I pleaded, I begged
 and I begged...

807
00:58:20,300 --> 00:58:22,800
Shit, like you, I don't
know how I'm here.

808
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:27,367
I'm just glad that I am.

809
00:58:32,167 --> 00:58:35,067
When you walked in, I knew
 you weren't from around here.

810
00:58:35,367 --> 00:58:36,833
- What do you mean?

811
00:58:48,967 --> 00:58:52,200
- Just remember, that
 in life sometimes

812
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:54,467
you're gonna be dealing
with the Pit Bulls.

813
00:58:54,467 --> 00:58:59,300
And if you slap one of them,
 they're gonna bite you back.

814
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:07,500
I know what you're thinking.

815
00:59:10,067 --> 00:59:12,100
Don't let it consume you.

816
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:15,700
It's something which
 ain't worth it.

817
00:59:23,833 --> 00:59:27,433
- Mila, this is Big D.

818
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:32,933
Whatever you need,
 this is the go-to guy.

819
00:59:38,733 --> 00:59:39,900
- [Driver] Ah ladies
 and gentlemen,

820
00:59:39,900 --> 00:59:41,667
there's some time
 to have a break,

821
00:59:41,667 --> 00:59:43,267
I gotta check the tires
and some other stuff,

822
00:59:43,267 --> 00:59:44,400
get some food or whatever

823
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:46,500
but, you have to
 get out of the bus.

824
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:49,267
And thank you again for
 riding, Don Luis Buslines.

825
00:59:51,433 --> 00:59:56,300
(faint hip hop music)

826
01:00:41,033 --> 01:00:43,000
- [Doctor] Hey,
 you're just in time.

827
01:00:43,567 --> 01:00:45,233
- Hope you have some good news.

828
01:00:45,233 --> 01:00:48,033
- Not for these guys,
 our male vic died of

829
01:00:48,033 --> 01:00:51,167
acute heroin and
 morphine intoxication.

830
01:00:51,267 --> 01:00:54,200
Apparently he was given
too much accidentally,

831
01:00:54,200 --> 01:00:56,400
or it was more potent
 than he thought.

832
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:58,933
He has alcohol in his system.

833
01:00:59,033 --> 01:01:00,767
- Any other substances?

834
01:01:00,767 --> 01:01:04,533
- Other than heroin,
 morphine and alcohol, no.

835
01:01:05,133 --> 01:01:06,800
- What about her?

836
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:08,700
- This young lady died
 of a gunshot wound

837
01:01:08,700 --> 01:01:12,367
straight to the head,
 right above the right ear.

838
01:01:12,367 --> 01:01:14,067
I sent the bullet
 off to ballistics,

839
01:01:14,067 --> 01:01:16,967
but other than that,
I'm still working on it.

840
01:01:16,967 --> 01:01:19,800
- Okay, well I'll get
 back to you later.

841
01:01:22,333 --> 01:01:24,267
- Hey, are you doing okay?

842
01:01:24,267 --> 01:01:25,600
- Yeah, why?

843
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:29,133
- Farrell, his wounds
 are long and deep

844
01:01:29,133 --> 01:01:31,600
but the impact was
 instantly fatal.

845
01:01:32,133 --> 01:01:35,067
- Can we just focus on
 this case, just this case,

846
01:01:35,067 --> 01:01:36,933
I wanna focus on this case.

847
01:01:36,933 --> 01:01:38,500
- Yes, of course.

848
01:01:38,500 --> 01:01:40,367
- I just wanna be
 done with today,

849
01:01:40,367 --> 01:01:41,600
tomorrow is another
 day, tomorrow,

850
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:43,500
is gonna be different, tomorrow.

851
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:45,733
Okay, take care of yourself.

852
01:01:45,733 --> 01:01:48,633
- Good luck, I think
 you're gonna need it.

853
01:01:53,533 --> 01:01:55,200
(door knocking)

854
01:01:55,700 --> 01:01:57,067
- You needed to talk to me, sir?

855
01:01:57,067 --> 01:01:59,667
- [Gonzales] Yes,
 Salinas, thank you.

856
01:02:00,100 --> 01:02:03,067
It's my understanding that you
 are in charge of this case?

857
01:02:03,067 --> 01:02:06,100
Now before you say
 anything, just let me say

858
01:02:06,100 --> 01:02:08,100
I know that detective
Farrell was your partner

859
01:02:08,100 --> 01:02:10,533
and I'm very sorry
 for your loss.

860
01:02:11,067 --> 01:02:12,533
- Thank you sir.

861
01:02:12,533 --> 01:02:15,233
- The DA seems to think it might
have an impact on the case.

862
01:02:15,233 --> 01:02:16,733
- No, I--

863
01:02:16,733 --> 01:02:18,533
- They think that there's a
 connection to your crime scene

864
01:02:18,533 --> 01:02:21,100
with a cold case from
 a few years back.

865
01:02:21,100 --> 01:02:23,633
Forensics found some prints
 from some of the vics,

866
01:02:23,633 --> 01:02:26,900
and so we are going
 to take it from here.

867
01:02:26,900 --> 01:02:29,067
Now if you will excuse me.

868
01:02:33,267 --> 01:02:34,967
- Sir, I need to talk to you!

869
01:02:34,967 --> 01:02:36,633
- No, not now Salinas,
 I've got a meeting.

870
01:02:36,633 --> 01:02:38,700
- Chief, you have to let
me work on that case.

871
01:02:38,700 --> 01:02:40,133
Let me be the one
 who brings it in!

872
01:02:40,133 --> 01:02:42,600
- I can't, I don't have
 jurisdiction, I wish I could.

873
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:44,700
- But with all due
respect, I can find her,

874
01:02:44,700 --> 01:02:47,700
I can interrogate her
 and I can get us--

875
01:02:47,700 --> 01:02:52,167
- Salinas, pride is a sin,
 but I like your persistence,

876
01:02:52,167 --> 01:02:54,400
but sorry, nothing personal.

877
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:55,900
- Come on chief,
you and I know--

878
01:02:55,900 --> 01:02:58,067
- You are not gonna stop
 asking about this, are you?

879
01:02:58,067 --> 01:02:59,167
- No.

880
01:03:00,500 --> 01:03:01,933
- Fine.

881
01:03:02,667 --> 01:03:05,467
You follow everything in
 that file, you understand?

882
01:03:06,167 --> 01:03:08,267
I'll call the deputy
and tell him (mumbling).

883
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:11,767
- Thank you chief.

884
01:03:12,100 --> 01:03:17,067
(ominous music)

885
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:28,300
(door knocking)

886
01:03:32,567 --> 01:03:33,767
- Coming.

887
01:03:43,267 --> 01:03:44,933
(door knocking)

888
01:04:50,700 --> 01:04:52,500
- FPD, open up.

889
01:04:55,967 --> 01:04:57,500
- I said 30 minutes
 ma'am, look what you did.

890
01:04:57,500 --> 01:05:00,233
- FPD, where are
your passengers?

891
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:03,267
- I told them 30 minutes ma'am,
they're surely not in there.

892
01:05:03,633 --> 01:05:05,633
Look I only have five
minutes to eat my lunch,

893
01:05:05,633 --> 01:05:06,900
then I begin boarding.

894
01:05:07,700 --> 01:05:09,500
Been driving this bus for hours,

895
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:11,067
is it okay if eat or what?

896
01:05:14,633 --> 01:05:15,867
- [Salinas] Shit.

897
01:05:16,300 --> 01:05:20,933
(anticipating music)

898
01:05:41,567 --> 01:05:42,967
Put your hands up.

899
01:05:44,467 --> 01:05:45,967
Spread your legs.

900
01:05:47,667 --> 01:05:50,267
Do you have anything sharp
 in your pockets, any weapon?

901
01:05:50,267 --> 01:05:51,467
- [Mila] No.

902
01:05:53,367 --> 01:05:55,600
I'm starting to get
used to these handcuffs.

903
01:05:56,133 --> 01:05:59,567
- I'm detective Salinas, I'm
 investing a double homicide,

904
01:05:59,567 --> 01:06:01,233
we need to talk to you.

905
01:06:04,733 --> 01:06:06,500
- We're leaving?

906
01:06:06,900 --> 01:06:08,433
I can't leave.

907
01:06:08,933 --> 01:06:10,933
I need permission to leave.

908
01:06:10,933 --> 01:06:12,567
- Don't be a smart ass.

909
01:06:12,567 --> 01:06:15,400
We're in the middle of
 a murder investigation

910
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:17,400
of what happened
in McCoy Street.

911
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:19,867
You're needed for
questioning and prints.

912
01:06:20,133 --> 01:06:21,667
- So I can't leave?

913
01:06:22,067 --> 01:06:23,833
- After I question
 you, yeah maybe,

914
01:06:23,833 --> 01:06:25,233
if you're innocent.

915
01:06:25,233 --> 01:06:28,300
Two people were murdered
 and the only witness we have

916
01:06:28,300 --> 01:06:30,600
gets up and leaves
 without a statement

917
01:06:30,600 --> 01:06:32,300
or a police report.

918
01:06:34,100 --> 01:06:35,733
- So let me guess.

919
01:06:36,500 --> 01:06:38,633
You think I killed those people?

920
01:06:40,100 --> 01:06:42,133
I was attacked by them.

921
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:44,900
- That doesn't give
 you the right to kill.

922
01:06:44,900 --> 01:06:47,767
The consequences
 apply to everyone.

923
01:06:47,767 --> 01:06:50,500
- You're right, you're right.

924
01:06:51,500 --> 01:06:53,667
I'm just gonna
 keep my mouth shut.

925
01:06:54,333 --> 01:06:55,500
Go ahead.

926
01:06:55,633 --> 01:06:58,067
- You do have the
right to remain silent.

927
01:06:58,233 --> 01:07:02,467
(foreboding music)

928
01:07:30,133 --> 01:07:31,700
- Can I tell you something?

929
01:07:32,367 --> 01:07:34,733
- Sure, about the case?

930
01:07:34,900 --> 01:07:38,267
- No, it's personal.

931
01:07:38,267 --> 01:07:39,733
- Yeah sure.

932
01:07:41,067 --> 01:07:45,700
- About a week ago, after
 I escaped from that house,

933
01:07:46,900 --> 01:07:51,900
I was picked up by this
 amazing wonderful, woman.

934
01:07:55,600 --> 01:07:58,900
I can tell you one thing,
 some people were just

935
01:07:59,800 --> 01:08:01,467
born to help.

936
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:06,933
And this woman was a
perfect example of that.

937
01:08:07,633 --> 01:08:10,567
Someone who is just
 driven by kindness.

938
01:08:14,133 --> 01:08:16,567
I'm just saying I don't
 know how to be like that.

939
01:08:18,267 --> 01:08:22,067
- [Salinas] Well, you
 can't expect to be perfect.

940
01:08:23,933 --> 01:08:26,100
This woman should inspire you,

941
01:08:26,833 --> 01:08:28,067
if you think about it,

942
01:08:28,067 --> 01:08:30,767
she was placed in your
 life for a reason.

943
01:08:33,367 --> 01:08:35,767
- I never heard
 anything like that.

944
01:08:40,767 --> 01:08:42,900
I'm a little nervous
 to go back there.

945
01:08:44,100 --> 01:08:46,100
Especially knowing what I know.

946
01:08:46,900 --> 01:08:48,933
- Know, what do you know?

947
01:08:49,633 --> 01:08:51,933
- Some information
 about Chief Gonzales.

948
01:08:52,900 --> 01:08:54,067
His involvement.

949
01:08:54,433 --> 01:08:55,900
- Yeah, right.

950
01:08:55,900 --> 01:08:57,267
- It's true.

951
01:08:58,200 --> 01:09:00,067
- What makes you say that?

952
01:09:00,633 --> 01:09:02,367
- I'm not saying another word.

953
01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:08,067
If you'd like I can show you.

954
01:09:08,833 --> 01:09:10,933
So you can see for yourself.

955
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:12,833
It's in my backpack.

956
01:09:15,467 --> 01:09:18,967
And by the way, I didn't do it.

957
01:09:21,300 --> 01:09:25,933
- Well truthfully, things are
 not looking too good for you.

958
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:29,933
I'm sorry I can't
 help you on this.

959
01:09:31,533 --> 01:09:34,100
I'm gonna drop you off
 in a couple of miles.

960
01:09:35,267 --> 01:09:36,467
- That's it?

961
01:09:37,633 --> 01:09:39,067
After I tell you, you're
just gonna ignore it

962
01:09:39,067 --> 01:09:40,633
and follow orders?

963
01:09:41,567 --> 01:09:42,833
A guilty man needs to pay!

964
01:09:42,833 --> 01:09:44,800
- Come on, that's crazy!

965
01:09:44,867 --> 01:09:48,367
I have direct orders, there's
 a chain of command here.

966
01:09:53,933 --> 01:09:54,867
(loud crash)

967
01:09:57,867 --> 01:10:02,633
(foreboding music)

968
01:10:36,700 --> 01:10:38,133
- [Mila] Put them on.

969
01:10:47,433 --> 01:10:48,700
Sit down.

970
01:10:53,900 --> 01:10:56,500
- You know you're not
getting away with this.

971
01:10:56,900 --> 01:11:00,200
- Does it look like I'm in
 the position to give a fuck?

972
01:11:01,067 --> 01:11:03,233
I'm the one with the gun, okay?

973
01:11:03,833 --> 01:11:06,200
You should've listened,
you should've listened,

974
01:11:06,200 --> 01:11:08,067
but you didn't, okay?

975
01:11:08,067 --> 01:11:10,533
You just wanted to follow
 orders instead of taking

976
01:11:10,533 --> 01:11:12,767
this opportunity to
 set things right.

977
01:11:13,167 --> 01:11:15,367
You're just a
 selfish little bitch.

978
01:11:15,367 --> 01:11:17,667
- Hey, take it easy.

979
01:11:18,500 --> 01:11:21,167
You know you're not
getting away with this.

980
01:11:21,367 --> 01:11:23,667
Let's just talk about
 what happened, okay?

981
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:26,367
- Before we go on any
 further, you should know that

982
01:11:26,367 --> 01:11:28,967
I'm specialized in
 forensic psychology.

983
01:11:28,967 --> 01:11:31,233
I also have a license
 to handle a gun,

984
01:11:31,233 --> 01:11:33,433
so it's not gonna go off
or anything like that.

985
01:11:33,433 --> 01:11:36,700
And about your little
 incident here...

986
01:11:38,867 --> 01:11:42,767
I just wanna leave,
 okay, go away.

987
01:11:44,067 --> 01:11:46,967
But any plans I had are
 just pretty much all ruined.

988
01:11:47,500 --> 01:11:50,067
- So what kind of
information do you have?

989
01:11:50,267 --> 01:11:54,633
You have all my attention,
 just take these cuffs off me.

990
01:11:55,500 --> 01:11:57,067
Unlike you, I'm
 not fond of them.

991
01:11:57,067 --> 01:12:00,767
- Look around, no
 one knows we're here.

992
01:12:02,100 --> 01:12:03,900
You could easily let me go.

993
01:12:05,133 --> 01:12:06,167
- I can't.

994
01:12:07,167 --> 01:12:08,767
So let's see what you have.

995
01:12:08,767 --> 01:12:10,667
- I conducted research
on certain psychological

996
01:12:10,667 --> 01:12:12,667
conditions, and found
 that these killers

997
01:12:12,667 --> 01:12:15,767
had some serious
 personality disorders.

998
01:12:16,067 --> 01:12:19,100
Low self-esteem, among
many other things, so...

999
01:12:19,567 --> 01:12:23,867
- So you escape and you
do some research, why?

1000
01:12:25,500 --> 01:12:27,067
- To understand them.

1001
01:12:28,067 --> 01:12:29,867
Sympathize with them.

1002
01:12:30,733 --> 01:12:33,733
And take my first step
 in forgiving them.

1003
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:37,800
- Bullcrap, I don't
 believe a word.

1004
01:12:39,067 --> 01:12:41,067
- Inside this book is a
 written report for the court

1005
01:12:41,067 --> 01:12:43,333
detailing all my
 psychological findings

1006
01:12:43,333 --> 01:12:45,833
upon which my
 conclusions are based on.

1007
01:12:47,300 --> 01:12:49,933
I guess I just don't want the
 chief to get a hold of it.

1008
01:13:00,767 --> 01:13:02,067
Get in the car.

1009
01:13:03,067 --> 01:13:04,567
Get in the fucking car.

1010
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:13,533
(ominous music)

1011
01:13:13,533 --> 01:13:17,800
- Hands, let me see
 your hands, now!

1012
01:13:18,300 --> 01:13:22,500
Drop the gun, gently
 on the ground, now.

1013
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:28,400
Out of the car, now.

1014
01:13:32,100 --> 01:13:35,733
Clasp your hands behind
your neck, over there.

1015
01:13:41,633 --> 01:13:43,567
Salinas uncuff yourself.

1016
01:13:44,067 --> 01:13:47,067
(anticipating music)

1017
01:13:47,367 --> 01:13:50,167
I'm Detective Borne,
 I followed you here

1018
01:13:50,167 --> 01:13:51,833
on direct orders
 from Chief Gonzales,

1019
01:13:51,833 --> 01:13:55,367
in case there was a problem,
 which was brilliant of him.

1020
01:13:55,933 --> 01:13:58,667
I can assure you that
you're safe now, ma'am.

1021
01:13:59,533 --> 01:14:02,067
You're not guilty,
 we all know that.

1022
01:14:02,367 --> 01:14:04,300
You're just scared, right?

1023
01:14:04,567 --> 01:14:05,567
- Yes.

1024
01:14:07,900 --> 01:14:09,467
I'm not guilty.

1025
01:14:10,067 --> 01:14:11,433
Just no handcuffs, please.

1026
01:14:11,433 --> 01:14:14,300
- I'm sorry, standard procedure.

1027
01:14:14,900 --> 01:14:16,267
Cuff her Salinas.

1028
01:14:17,433 --> 01:14:19,433
We're gonna cuff you
 and we'll put you

1029
01:14:19,433 --> 01:14:21,200
in the back of the car.

1030
01:14:21,733 --> 01:14:23,800
We'll ask you a
 couple of questions

1031
01:14:23,800 --> 01:14:25,433
and then you can go.

1032
01:14:26,433 --> 01:14:28,067
Salinas, you okay?

1033
01:14:28,367 --> 01:14:29,867
- Yeah, I'm okay.

1034
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:32,833
- [Borne] Alright then,
come on, let's go.

1035
01:15:07,433 --> 01:15:10,067
Whenever you're
 ready, we can begin.

1036
01:15:10,267 --> 01:15:14,900
(foreboding music)

1037
01:15:26,733 --> 01:15:28,467
- I'm glad you're still here.

1038
01:15:41,933 --> 01:15:43,933
- I just have a few questions.

1039
01:15:44,567 --> 01:15:47,267
And please don't make
 my job any harder.

1040
01:15:47,267 --> 01:15:49,400
You already crashed my car.

1041
01:15:52,567 --> 01:15:54,733
- Look I told you I'm
 not saying anything.

1042
01:16:00,300 --> 01:16:03,533
Okay listen, cause I'm only
 gonna tell you this once.

1043
01:16:05,733 --> 01:16:07,767
I was walking in the street,

1044
01:16:08,567 --> 01:16:10,333
that's when Gambit saw me.

1045
01:16:10,767 --> 01:16:13,300
The white guy, he
 started following me.

1046
01:16:14,867 --> 01:16:18,900
He took me back to the house
 and they started fighting.

1047
01:16:21,800 --> 01:16:24,100
Afterwards one of the
 serial killers was dead...

1048
01:16:24,733 --> 01:16:25,900
- What killer?

1049
01:16:26,567 --> 01:16:27,833
- Dale.

1050
01:16:28,633 --> 01:16:31,367
Then he shot Hersey and
then he started chasing

1051
01:16:31,367 --> 01:16:33,867
me around the house,
 shooting at me.

1052
01:16:35,100 --> 01:16:36,367
That's when I ran out the house

1053
01:16:36,367 --> 01:16:39,533
and next thing I knew
 I was at the hospital

1054
01:16:39,533 --> 01:16:41,533
with a gunshot wound.

1055
01:16:42,900 --> 01:16:44,300
So I left.

1056
01:16:45,833 --> 01:16:50,133
- You do realize you
 were fleeing the country,

1057
01:16:51,767 --> 01:16:53,800
by leaving for Mexico?

1058
01:16:55,500 --> 01:16:58,433
Isn't that weird if you're
 innocent, as you say?

1059
01:16:58,433 --> 01:17:01,100
- Well that's my statement
 and it is not changing.

1060
01:17:02,467 --> 01:17:05,200
And I'm saying another
 word 'till I get my lawyer.

1061
01:17:09,567 --> 01:17:13,467
- Okay, agreed, one
(door slams shut) for me

1062
01:17:13,467 --> 01:17:15,600
and have one for you.

1063
01:17:22,600 --> 01:17:24,233
- It's kinda big...

1064
01:17:25,200 --> 01:17:27,967
- Hah, yes it is.

1065
01:17:29,300 --> 01:17:32,767
Thank you, it's
 really excellent work.

1066
01:17:33,533 --> 01:17:35,233
I'm gonna go see if I can
 get some more information

1067
01:17:35,233 --> 01:17:37,833
out of her, and Detective
 Borne, he is waiting outside,

1068
01:17:37,833 --> 01:17:39,767
he'll take you back
 to the station.

1069
01:17:40,433 --> 01:17:42,267
I'll talk to you
when I get back.

1070
01:17:42,633 --> 01:17:44,067
Appreciate your help.

1071
01:17:45,433 --> 01:17:49,967
- Ah, my head...

1072
01:17:50,367 --> 01:17:50,900
(gunshot)

1073
01:17:50,900 --> 01:17:51,733
(gasps)

1074
01:17:52,467 --> 01:17:57,200
(foreboding music)

1075
01:18:09,400 --> 01:18:10,533
- [Gonzales] You did this?

1076
01:18:12,500 --> 01:18:14,500
Your idea of a fucking joke?

1077
01:18:14,833 --> 01:18:17,967
Come into my town, terrorize
 it, and then leave?

1078
01:18:19,067 --> 01:18:20,667
- [Mila] I didn't do that.

1079
01:18:22,267 --> 01:18:24,100
And you don't scare me.

1080
01:18:24,667 --> 01:18:27,300
You sit at your desk and
 you act like you're a cop?

1081
01:18:28,133 --> 01:18:31,933
There's a crime pattern,
a trail of dead bodies

1082
01:18:31,933 --> 01:18:34,267
and murdered women all
 along Interstate 40

1083
01:18:34,267 --> 01:18:37,867
from Oklahoma to Texas that
 leads straight into this town.

1084
01:18:38,167 --> 01:18:39,767
You knew all along
 who was doing it

1085
01:18:39,767 --> 01:18:41,800
and you let the
 killings continue.

1086
01:18:44,667 --> 01:18:47,067
But because your
 remorse was so much

1087
01:18:47,067 --> 01:18:49,867
bigger than your puny
 ass little brain...

1088
01:18:51,067 --> 01:18:52,700
You thought the
fatherly thing to do was

1089
01:18:52,700 --> 01:18:57,700
to help your son cover
up murder after murder?

1090
01:19:00,667 --> 01:19:02,267
I mean why tarnish
 your reputation

1091
01:19:02,267 --> 01:19:05,833
because of a relationship you
 had with the town's whore?

1092
01:19:06,700 --> 01:19:10,067
And your son, Dale.

1093
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:14,467
Your name is written on
his birth certificate

1094
01:19:14,467 --> 01:19:17,933
out in Houston, but it's a
 big secret out here, isn't it?

1095
01:19:20,200 --> 01:19:22,067
But what about the victims?

1096
01:19:22,733 --> 01:19:24,567
Fuck 'em, right?

1097
01:19:25,500 --> 01:19:28,667
That was the right and moral
 thing to do, wasn't it?

1098
01:19:30,833 --> 01:19:34,800
But tell me, how did it feel,

1099
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:38,067
to wrap your fingers
 around Ms. Rodgers throat?

1100
01:19:39,200 --> 01:19:41,667
And then hang her afterwards?

1101
01:19:43,433 --> 01:19:46,133
And cover it up with
 such excellence?

1102
01:19:46,600 --> 01:19:48,300
- Who the fuck are you?

1103
01:19:50,733 --> 01:19:52,233
- [Mila] Nobody.

1104
01:19:53,333 --> 01:19:54,867
Does it matter?

1105
01:19:56,700 --> 01:19:59,233
You wanna teach me
 like you taught Dale?

1106
01:19:59,533 --> 01:20:01,967
- Look bitch, you
 just crossed the line,

1107
01:20:01,967 --> 01:20:04,200
and since you're pushing I'm
 fucking going there with you,

1108
01:20:04,200 --> 01:20:06,067
you are as good as dead.

1109
01:20:08,633 --> 01:20:13,033
(heavy breathing)

1110
01:20:15,100 --> 01:20:16,567
Wrapping my fingers
 around her neck,

1111
01:20:16,567 --> 01:20:20,367
that ex-wife is, it's
just like 20 years ago.

1112
01:20:24,733 --> 01:20:28,833
I walked into that house
and I walked upstairs

1113
01:20:28,833 --> 01:20:31,567
and she is there
touching my son.

1114
01:20:35,033 --> 01:20:38,000
And in the divorce
 she gets custody.

1115
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:41,367
I, I am denied visitation.

1116
01:20:41,367 --> 01:20:44,567
And that bitch changes his name
from Dale just to spite me.

1117
01:20:47,333 --> 01:20:49,500
So I just drive for eight hours

1118
01:20:49,500 --> 01:20:51,800
and I settle right
 here in Fieldhouse.

1119
01:20:51,800 --> 01:20:54,200
Oh and then she
 decides to drive along

1120
01:20:54,200 --> 01:20:55,800
and settle here too.

1121
01:20:55,800 --> 01:20:59,800
(laughs) Aah...

1122
01:21:01,400 --> 01:21:04,300
But then I remarried and
the rest was history.

1123
01:21:08,533 --> 01:21:09,833
Look...

1124
01:21:12,967 --> 01:21:15,267
I will not hurt my family.

1125
01:21:16,167 --> 01:21:19,167
And I don't believe in doing
 the right thing when it

1126
01:21:19,167 --> 01:21:22,433
means that everything I love
 can be taken away from me.

1127
01:21:25,067 --> 01:21:28,767
Yeah so a few years back,
 I was sitting at my desk

1128
01:21:28,767 --> 01:21:31,967
analyzing some of the
killings on my computer.

1129
01:21:33,767 --> 01:21:35,833
And one of the murder
 weapons comes up.

1130
01:21:37,267 --> 01:21:39,067
It's a baseball bat.

1131
01:21:40,833 --> 01:21:44,467
Baseball bat that I had given
 Dale when he was 10 years old.

1132
01:21:45,067 --> 01:21:46,100
Yeah...

1133
01:21:47,367 --> 01:21:49,433
Imagine my surprise.

1134
01:21:50,967 --> 01:21:52,767
I knew it was him,

1135
01:21:52,767 --> 01:21:56,133
(mumbling) for that
fucking little bastard.

1136
01:21:57,133 --> 01:21:59,633
Fuck this, fuck you.

1137
01:22:01,700 --> 01:22:02,867
Gah!

1138
01:22:06,167 --> 01:22:10,300
Okay, enough with the sad shit.

1139
01:22:10,867 --> 01:22:12,533
I've got things to do.

1140
01:22:13,400 --> 01:22:15,100
I need to go clear
 things up with the DA

1141
01:22:15,100 --> 01:22:20,100
and then my son has a soccer
 game with the Plainville Owls.

1142
01:22:21,233 --> 01:22:23,067
Do you like soccer?

1143
01:22:24,067 --> 01:22:25,067
Let's go.

1144
01:22:26,100 --> 01:22:27,133
Get up.

1145
01:22:37,233 --> 01:22:38,900
Let's walk and talk.

1146
01:22:40,433 --> 01:22:41,967
You would've made
 a good detective,

1147
01:22:41,967 --> 01:22:43,933
I read your reports,
 they're not bad.

1148
01:22:45,300 --> 01:22:47,100
A shame this is the
 end of the road.

1149
01:22:47,233 --> 01:22:48,233
(gunshot)

1150
01:22:54,333 --> 01:22:55,833
- [Salinas] Oh my God...

1151
01:23:00,467 --> 01:23:02,367
I heard everything.

1152
01:23:03,167 --> 01:23:05,467
This fucking asshole...

1153
01:23:06,733 --> 01:23:10,467
I left the recorder,
 (mumbling)...

1154
01:23:12,200 --> 01:23:14,833
I left the recorder, go grab it

1155
01:23:14,833 --> 01:23:18,733
in the interrogation room.

1156
01:23:19,267 --> 01:23:22,267
You give it to the
 right people, okay?

1157
01:23:25,333 --> 01:23:26,567
- [Mila] I'm sorry.

1158
01:23:28,867 --> 01:23:32,933
- I should've listened,
I should've listened.

1159
01:23:34,100 --> 01:23:38,533
(whimpering)

1160
01:23:42,867 --> 01:23:44,500
Did you kill them?

1161
01:23:55,400 --> 01:23:57,300
- [Mila] It's what you can't see

1162
01:23:57,300 --> 01:23:58,833
that causes the most damage.

1163
01:23:58,833 --> 01:24:00,333
(door knocking)

1164
01:24:00,333 --> 01:24:02,967
- [Hersey] I'm getting the
 door, I am getting the door.

1165
01:24:02,967 --> 01:24:05,800
Shit, I'm looking
 like a stripper.

1166
01:24:07,367 --> 01:24:08,767
What the fuck?

1167
01:24:08,767 --> 01:24:09,533
(gasps)

1168
01:24:10,100 --> 01:24:14,667
(anticipating music)

1169
01:24:28,667 --> 01:24:29,700
(gunshot)

1170
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:37,800
(ominous music)
