00:25:00,044 --> 00:25:00,677
Not yet.

362
00:25:01,097 --> 00:25:02,847
Then why don't we leave that
to the police?

363
00:25:02,848 --> 00:25:03,708
Good day, Mr. Aaron.

364
00:25:03,709 --> 00:25:05,263
It's not a good day.

365
00:25:05,876 --> 00:25:07,440
Not for either of us.

366
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,784
Don't you get frightened
here on your own

367
00:25:10,785 --> 00:25:12,636
in a big house like this?

368
00:25:13,556 --> 00:25:16,945
Only when people like you
say things like that.

369
00:25:18,751 --> 00:25:21,140
A Detective Inspector
Vance has arrived.

370
00:25:21,141 --> 00:25:24,262
Um, it might be better
if he doesn't see me.

371
00:25:24,263 --> 00:25:26,242
Do you have
a back entrance?

372
00:25:26,243 --> 00:25:29,851
We don't usually have a need
for a back entrance.

373
00:25:29,967 --> 00:25:31,020
If there's nothing else,

374
00:25:31,021 --> 00:25:32,578
then I'll
dismiss the--

375
00:25:32,579 --> 00:25:35,439
The wages
are in envelopes in the hall.

376
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:42,046
What does Stasio
need the oxygen for?

377
00:25:42,047 --> 00:25:42,908
Was he ill?

378
00:25:46,286 --> 00:25:47,338
He thought he was ill.

379
00:25:47,339 --> 00:25:49,054
There was
nothing wrong with him.

380
00:25:49,055 --> 00:25:49,639
Goodbye.

381
00:25:50,012 --> 00:25:52,349
Where's all his
paintings, then?

382
00:25:52,787 --> 00:25:54,028
What are you
doing here?

383
00:25:54,029 --> 00:25:56,641
Would you please ask this man
to leave, Detective,

384
00:25:56,642 --> 00:25:58,042
and not come back again?

385
00:25:58,043 --> 00:26:00,141
Get out,
like the lady says.

386
00:26:09,454 --> 00:26:11,587
I warned you, didn't I?
Keep out of this.

387
00:26:11,588 --> 00:26:13,103
Was she his mistress?

388
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:15,984
He was doing all right
for an old man.

389
00:26:15,985 --> 00:26:17,832
Maybe I should
take up painting.

390
00:26:17,833 --> 00:26:18,788
I'm giving her
24-hour protection

391
00:26:18,789 --> 00:26:19,937
for the next
couple of days.

392
00:26:19,938 --> 00:26:21,274
I'll tell my men
to arrest you

393
00:26:21,275 --> 00:26:22,932
if you show up here
again, all right?

394
00:26:22,933 --> 00:26:25,801
You never offered me
24-hour protection.

395
00:26:26,819 --> 00:26:28,794
Oh, come on, Frank.
It's obvious.

396
00:26:28,795 --> 00:26:30,132
It's got to be
Selina, the wife.

397
00:26:30,133 --> 00:26:31,474
She gets dumped
for a younger woman,

398
00:26:31,475 --> 00:26:32,427
thrown out of her home.

399
00:26:32,428 --> 00:26:33,320
She feels bitter.

400
00:26:33,321 --> 00:26:34,628
She doesn't want Stasio

00:26:34,629 --> 00:26:35,709
to go through with
divorcing her,

402
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:36,666
so she kills him.

403
00:26:36,667 --> 00:26:37,431
Absolutely.

404
00:26:38,039 --> 00:26:39,501
There's only one drawback--
she didn't do it.

00:26:39,502 --> 00:26:40,651
How do you know?

406
00:26:40,652 --> 00:26:42,308
She was at a party
in London, all night,

00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:43,263

She didn't do it.

And what about Angeline,
where was she?

410
00:26:45,845 --> 00:26:48,292
Come on, Frank,
I know you asked.

with the family solicitor.

Come on, Frank.

Ton, don't make me have
an argument about it.

00:27:10,864 --> 00:27:12,775
Would it be all right
if I take the car?

00:27:12,776 --> 00:27:14,511
No, it ain't all right.

00:27:17,268 --> 00:27:17,780
Go on.

421
00:27:19,593 --> 00:27:21,889
I understand
you represented Stasio,

Mr. Roscoe.

423
00:27:22,844 --> 00:27:24,087
Yes, that's correct.

00:27:24,088 --> 00:27:25,490
Why did you pick Tony's--

425
00:27:25,491 --> 00:27:28,405
Mr. Aaron's agency
to fake the adultery?

426
00:27:28,482 --> 00:27:29,441
Look, I'm not saying--

427
00:27:29,442 --> 00:27:30,397
It's all right.

in any of that.

Well, he'd, uh...

done some work for me
a couple of times before...

matrimonial, similar work.

433
00:27:40,624 --> 00:27:42,252
I didn't really know him.

434
00:27:42,253 --> 00:27:42,764
I see.

435
00:27:43,622 --> 00:27:46,069
What was Stasio like
as a client?

436
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:47,256
Very difficult.

437
00:27:47,797 --> 00:27:49,325
He was forever
changing his mind.

438
00:27:49,326 --> 00:27:50,600
But he paid well.

439
00:27:52,099 --> 00:27:53,210
Is that a question?

00:27:53,211 --> 00:27:54,298

that he was murdered?

00:27:55,668 --> 00:27:57,063
That is a question.

443
00:27:57,519 --> 00:28:00,002
Mr. Stasio had instructed me
to invite her here

00:28:00,003 --> 00:28:02,288
to explain about the...
adultery

too late to stop it.

00:28:06,121 --> 00:28:07,077
Why didn't he tell her?

448
00:28:07,078 --> 00:28:08,669
You'd have to ask her.

449
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:10,477
What time
did she leave?

450
00:28:10,552 --> 00:28:12,234
Very late. About 10:00.

451
00:28:12,334 --> 00:28:13,642
What did you do then?

452
00:28:13,643 --> 00:28:14,566
I went home.

Mr. Aaron!

00:30:14,294 --> 00:30:16,587
It's your own fault. I told you
not to come back here.

456
00:30:16,588 --> 00:30:17,391
I'm sorry.

457
00:30:19,773 --> 00:30:21,398
I didn't mean
to frighten you.

458
00:30:21,399 --> 00:30:23,215
You didn't frighten me.
I frightened you.

You can leave now.

Is this you?

00:31:20,589 --> 00:31:22,098
It has
the curious effect

470
00:31:22,099 --> 00:31:24,874
of making strangers
think they know me.

471
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:30,432
Where did you meet Stasio?

472
00:31:30,761 --> 00:31:32,493
At an exhibition
in Miami.

473
00:31:32,494 --> 00:31:33,658
I admired
his paintings.

474
00:31:33,659 --> 00:31:35,454
He asked me
to model for him.

475
00:31:35,455 --> 00:31:36,715
And here you are.

476
00:31:37,721 --> 00:31:38,793
I was an art student.

477
00:31:38,794 --> 00:31:39,958
I decided to
give up painting

478
00:31:39,959 --> 00:31:41,282
when I saw
what he could do

479
00:31:41,283 --> 00:31:42,660
with his eyes shut.

You must be sitting
on a gold mine.

484
00:31:52,021 --> 00:31:53,881
Well, do you think
I killed him

485
00:31:53,882 --> 00:31:54,911
to make money?

486
00:31:56,464 --> 00:31:58,596
I was just
thinking out loud.

487
00:31:59,958 --> 00:32:02,037
I could take this painting
to any gallery in the world

probably more.

If you take it out,
you can keep it.

00:32:22,101 --> 00:32:24,231
What are you
trying to prove?

491
00:32:24,652 --> 00:32:26,199
It's a serious offer.

492
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,007
I wanted to show you

493
00:32:41,254 --> 00:32:43,047

He was the most powerful man

515
00:33:47,433 --> 00:33:49,333
but he was... so obsessive,

516
00:33:51,177 --> 00:33:53,606
and he became...
obsessed with me.

517
00:33:56,059 --> 00:33:57,495
He threw Selina out.

518
00:33:57,508 --> 00:33:59,872
He said he'd divorce her
and marry me,

519
00:33:59,873 --> 00:34:02,172
even though I kept telling him
I was going back to America.

520
00:34:02,173 --> 00:34:03,496
I didn't mean to stay with him.

521
00:34:03,497 --> 00:34:05,865
Things just...
got out of hand...

522
00:34:08,437 --> 00:34:10,580
and then, he wouldn't let me go.

523
00:34:10,581 --> 00:34:12,475
He said
he'd kill himself

524
00:34:12,659 --> 00:34:13,452
if I left.

525
00:34:15,054 --> 00:34:16,956
Maybe that's what happened.

526
00:34:17,919 --> 00:34:21,388
Maybe he shot your wife
and then... shot himself.

527
00:34:21,417 --> 00:34:22,219
Yeah, sure,

528
00:34:23,117 --> 00:34:25,872
and then what did he do
with the gun?

You weren't there, Frank.

00:34:59,466 --> 00:35:01,906

A souvenir, from the war.

00:35:15,342 --> 00:35:16,996
Why did you lie to me?

537
00:35:17,733 --> 00:35:19,964
for it, and I'm in enough shit

538
00:35:20,189 --> 00:35:23,521
as it is, all right?
No, it is not all right.

539
00:35:24,286 --> 00:35:24,853

What are you doing?

00:36:23,283 --> 00:36:24,195

554
00:36:25,046 --> 00:36:26,966
where did you go

00:36:31,849 --> 00:36:33,361
I may have driven around
for a while,

559
00:36:33,362 --> 00:36:34,651
I was pretty upset.

exactly where I went.

Of course I'm jealous.

around all together.

I was in my car.

00:42:31,995 --> 00:42:34,619

Well, what height
was he?

00:42:36,371 --> 00:42:38,233
And don't say
my height.

691
00:42:38,769 --> 00:42:39,815
Couldn't tell.

00:42:40,139 --> 00:42:41,416
Did you tell
the police?

693
00:42:41,417 --> 00:42:43,799
Mm. They'll think
I made it up.

I'm not an expert
in marriages.

697
00:42:51,958 --> 00:42:53,107
When you were with her,

698
00:42:53,108 --> 00:42:54,513
did you want to be
with other people?

699
00:42:54,514 --> 00:42:56,113
Oh, yes.
All the time.

know what they're doing,

00:42:59,367 --> 00:43:00,771
or do you think we're...

703
00:43:00,772 --> 00:43:03,285

we can't control.

704

and it's not
the women and children

707
00:43:09,298 --> 00:43:10,640

708
00:43:10,771 --> 00:43:11,921

that are ready

709

to step on the others.

You're so like me.

like yourself, do you?

Things'd be different
if I was in America.

714
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:25,170

a different person,

00:43:25,171 --> 00:43:26,097
a new start.

00:43:30,826 --> 00:43:32,235

00:43:32,586 --> 00:43:35,236
She's more like me
than I care to admit.

and then thrown away.

00:43:38,622 --> 00:43:40,832
So why did you
stay with him?

720
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:43,507
Because I need people
to tell me that they love me,

721
00:43:43,508 --> 00:43:44,722
and when they do,

722
00:43:44,723 --> 00:43:47,371
I get frightened
and want to run away.

You're not answering
my question.

why did--

Okay, okay.

tell you this,

but a few days ago,
I came back,

I know she did it.

00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:38,011
Why, what was
her motive?

Shall we begin?

868
00:53:57,327 --> 00:53:59,291
The will is a document
of considerable length,

869
00:53:59,292 --> 00:54:00,865
and the deceased names

870
00:54:01,012 --> 00:54:02,918
a number
of art foundations and libraries

871
00:54:02,919 --> 00:54:05,460
who are to receive
his diaries and sketch books

872
00:54:05,461 --> 00:54:06,732
and other effects,

873
00:54:06,733 --> 00:54:07,779
but I'll concentrate first

874
00:54:07,780 --> 00:54:09,113
on the main division
of the estate

875
00:54:09,114 --> 00:54:10,393
and the paintings,

876
00:54:11,339 --> 00:54:14,281
which is considerably
more straightforward.

It's outrageous!

00:54:27,554 --> 00:54:28,353
That's it?

882
00:54:28,510 --> 00:54:29,138
But I...

883
00:54:30,826 --> 00:54:33,306

00:54:33,307 --> 00:54:35,311

when he wrote his will, I--

887
00:54:41,318 --> 00:54:42,885
When was this written?

888
00:54:43,768 --> 00:54:45,007
When was it written?

889
00:54:45,008 --> 00:54:46,695
December the 21st, 1959.

890
00:54:47,134 --> 00:54:48,346
The day he died.

891
00:54:49,074 --> 00:54:51,426
He changes his will
so that she gets everything,

892
00:54:51,427 --> 00:54:53,868
and that same day,
he's murdered.

00:54:55,495 --> 00:54:56,248
You bitch.

894
00:54:57,687 --> 00:54:58,987
You couldn't wait.

895
00:54:58,988 --> 00:55:00,675
As soon as
he'd signed everything,

896
00:55:00,676 --> 00:55:02,076
you got rid of him,
didn't you?

897
00:55:02,077 --> 00:55:04,339
I told you, Frank,
I told you.

898
00:55:04,682 --> 00:55:06,942
She got his name
on the paper-- bang.

899
00:55:06,943 --> 00:55:08,271

01:06:25,150 --> 01:06:26,101
More or less.

1078
01:06:26,102 --> 01:06:27,855
And how many,
approximately,

1079
01:06:27,856 --> 01:06:28,666
of these...

1080
01:06:28,812 --> 01:06:30,973
dirty weekends did you arrange?

1081
01:06:31,705 --> 01:06:33,847
I don't know, a dozen, maybe?

1082
01:06:35,111 --> 01:06:36,064
Yes, well,
let's not argue

1083
01:06:36,064 --> 01:06:37,975
with that figure
for the moment, a dozen.

1084
01:06:37,976 --> 01:06:40,418
So on at least
a dozen occasions,

1085
01:06:40,775 --> 01:06:42,843
you went to court... and lied.

1086
01:06:42,844 --> 01:06:44,881
And you lied
and you lied again--

1087
01:06:44,882 --> 01:06:45,344
Well--

1088
01:06:45,803 --> 01:06:46,752
It doesn't inspire
much confidence

1089
01:06:46,753 --> 01:06:47,903
in you telling
the truth now,

1090
01:06:47,904 --> 01:06:49,293
does it, Mr. Aaron?

1091
01:06:51,845 --> 01:06:53,628
Why did you leave
the police force?

1092
01:06:53,629 --> 01:06:54,148
Well...

1093
01:06:56,275 --> 01:06:57,433
Well, a friend--

1094
01:06:57,892 --> 01:07:00,745
a friend of mine
was killed, and, um...

1095
01:07:04,990 --> 01:07:06,441
And what, Mr. Aaron?

1096
01:07:08,903 --> 01:07:11,004
I couldn't take the pressure,
I had to leave.

1097
01:07:11,005 --> 01:07:12,914
Isn't it the case
that you were told to resign

1098
01:07:12,915 --> 01:07:15,234
in return for formal charges
being dropped against you?

1099
01:07:15,235 --> 01:07:16,760
That's enough,
Mr. Jenkins.

1100
01:07:16,761 --> 01:07:19,435
The jury will ignore
that last remark.

1101
01:07:19,436 --> 01:07:20,309
Mr. Aaron...

1102
01:07:21,726 --> 01:07:23,351
Why did you marry your wife?

1103
01:07:23,352 --> 01:07:25,386
What do you mean?
That's a stupid question.

1104
01:07:25,387 --> 01:07:27,903
Well, stupid or not,
why did you marry your wife?

1105
01:07:27,904 --> 01:07:30,637
The same reason everybody does,
because I loved her.

1106
01:07:30,638 --> 01:07:33,134
I don't believe
that's the truth.

1107
01:07:33,342 --> 01:07:35,724
Tony bought a car off me
a couple of years ago,

1108
01:07:35,725 --> 01:07:37,579
and we got to be friends.

1109
01:07:37,959 --> 01:07:40,532
He was seeing this married woman
at the time, you know.

1110
01:07:40,533 --> 01:07:41,832
This was
Hazel Powers?

1111
01:07:41,834 --> 01:07:43,013
Yeah, that's right.

1112
01:07:43,014 --> 01:07:44,446
Then a copper
was killed by Powers,

1113
01:07:44,447 --> 01:07:46,541
and he was... tried and hung.

1114
01:07:48,201 --> 01:07:50,180
Anyway, Tony and I
were drinking one night,

1115
01:07:50,181 --> 01:07:52,275
and he said he was going
to marry Hazel, you know.

1116
01:07:52,276 --> 01:07:53,544
I couldn't believe it,

1117
01:07:53,545 --> 01:07:54,692
because
all he'd ever said before

1118
01:07:54,694 --> 01:07:56,287
was she was just a good...

1119
01:07:55,287 --> 01:07:55,625
Yes?

1120
01:07:58,084 --> 01:07:59,009
Good in bed.

1121
01:08:02,139 --> 01:08:03,242
I never thought

1122
01:08:03,728 --> 01:08:05,316
he really cared
about her.

1123
01:08:05,317 --> 01:08:07,040
I said this to him,
and he just laughed.

1124
01:08:07,041 --> 01:08:08,755
He said, "Have you
seen her house?

1125
01:08:08,756 --> 01:08:10,475
Do you know how much
money she's got?"

1126
01:08:10,476 --> 01:08:13,115
He didn't leave much doubt
about why he was marrying her.

1127
01:08:13,116 --> 01:08:16,621
Did you see Mr. Aaron
subsequent to the marriage.

1128
01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:18,553
After they got married,

1129
01:08:18,554 --> 01:08:19,765
Tony found out
this guy, Powers,

1130
01:08:19,766 --> 01:08:20,871
had huge debts.

1131
01:08:21,231 --> 01:08:22,663
He was virtually
bankrupt.

1132
01:08:22,664 --> 01:08:25,113
His club was sold,
his house was put on the market,

1133
01:08:25,114 --> 01:08:27,499
and Hazel didn't end up
with anything at all.

1134
01:08:27,500 --> 01:08:30,172
He was really mad
when he found out.

1135
01:08:30,965 --> 01:08:33,511
He said he'd made
the biggest mistake of his life.

1136
01:08:33,512 --> 01:08:35,202
Mr. Aaron,
were you aware

1137
01:08:35,203 --> 01:08:37,140
that your wife had
an insurance policy

1138
01:08:37,141 --> 01:08:38,222
through the access
trades union

1139
01:08:38,223 --> 01:08:39,367
of which
she was a member?

1140
01:08:39,369 --> 01:08:39,651
No.

1141
01:08:40,959 --> 01:08:41,944
Well, I wasn't

1142
01:08:41,945 --> 01:08:43,282
until I went through
her things after--

1143
01:08:43,283 --> 01:08:45,600
Do you recall
the conditions of the policy?

1144
01:08:45,601 --> 01:08:47,677
I just read it
through once.

1145
01:08:47,678 --> 01:08:49,011
You stood to gain
a thousand pounds

1146
01:08:49,012 --> 01:08:50,343
in the event
of her death.

1147
01:08:50,344 --> 01:08:51,395
Look, it's a standard
insurance policy--

1148
01:08:51,396 --> 01:08:52,921
Thank you, Mr. Aaron,
that's all for now.

1149
01:08:52,922 --> 01:08:55,091
I can say
with complete confidence

1150
01:08:55,092 --> 01:08:57,124
that this is the gun
that killed them both.

1151
01:08:57,125 --> 01:08:59,909
We asked him twice
if he owned a gun.

1152
01:09:01,104 --> 01:09:02,844
He denied it both times.

1153
01:09:02,882 --> 01:09:04,156
Is this your gun?

1154
01:09:04,763 --> 01:09:07,432
I said, is this your gun,
Mr. Aaron?

1155
01:09:10,012 --> 01:09:11,312
It looks like my gun.

1156
01:09:11,313 --> 01:09:13,892
How did it come to be
in the boiler room of the hotel?

1157
01:09:13,893 --> 01:09:15,514
It was stolen from me.

1158
01:09:15,745 --> 01:09:17,076
I had a break-in in my office.

1159
01:09:17,077 --> 01:09:19,336
Really? And when did you
report it stolen?

1160
01:09:19,337 --> 01:09:21,275
I didn't know anything
was missing at the time.

1161
01:09:21,276 --> 01:09:22,930
I didn't realize
until after the murders.

1162
01:09:23,531 --> 01:09:26,329
And were there any witnesses
to this alleged break-in?

1163
01:09:26,330 --> 01:09:28,968
Yes, the client I was helping.
He was with me.

1164
01:09:28,969 --> 01:09:30,178
Who is this man?

1165
01:09:30,561 --> 01:09:31,801
He's a barrister.

1166
01:09:31,802 --> 01:09:33,805
Oh, and, uh,
we'll get a chance to talk

1167
01:09:33,806 --> 01:09:35,013
to this
barrister, will we?

1168
01:09:35,014 --> 01:09:36,668
He doesn't want
to appear in court.
Really?

1169
01:09:36,669 --> 01:09:38,391
Well, that'll be the first
barrister I've ever known

1170
01:09:38,392 --> 01:09:39,821
to be shy of appearing in court.

1171
01:09:39,822 --> 01:09:42,265
So really,
what you're telling us

1172
01:09:42,301 --> 01:09:43,606
is that no one
can substantiate

1173
01:09:43,607 --> 01:09:44,848
this alleged break-in?

1174
01:09:44,849 --> 01:09:46,251
Yes, this barrister can.

1175
01:09:46,252 --> 01:09:47,119
Yes, well...

1176
01:09:50,860 --> 01:09:52,359
Why did you have a gun?

1177
01:09:52,360 --> 01:09:54,015
I mean,
did you, uh...

1178
01:09:54,016 --> 01:09:55,350
did you use it
to threaten people?

1179
01:09:55,351 --> 01:09:57,286
Really, My Lord, I must object.

1180
01:09:57,287 --> 01:09:58,244
I'm just trying
to understand.

1181
01:09:58,245 --> 01:09:59,486
I mean, why did you have a gun?

1182
01:09:59,487 --> 01:10:01,839
I don't know,
I just kept it, that's all.

1183
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:05,443
And when did you apply
for a license for the gun?

1184
01:10:08,078 --> 01:10:10,389
I didn't have a license for it.

1185
01:10:11,342 --> 01:10:12,899
We've got to get
that barrister to talk.

1186
01:10:12,900 --> 01:10:14,573
He won't.
I've tried.

1187
01:10:18,724 --> 01:10:21,335
The beretta was fired
three times in all

1188
01:10:21,336 --> 01:10:23,719
from a distance
of less than four feet,

1189
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:25,119
using one of
the bedroom pillows

1190
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:26,571
to muffle the noise.

1191
01:10:26,744 --> 01:10:27,855
Stasio was hit twice...

1192
01:10:27,856 --> 01:10:29,248
Give this to Frank.

1193
01:10:30,023 --> 01:10:32,251
The first bullet penetrated
his chest and his heart,

1194
01:10:32,252 --> 01:10:34,378
and in all probability,
he was already dead

1195
01:10:34,379 --> 01:10:36,654
when the second shot
was fired.

1196
01:10:41,284 --> 01:10:42,747
You've made yourself
hard to meet.

1197
01:10:42,748 --> 01:10:43,959
Look, I'm afraid

1198
01:10:44,020 --> 01:10:45,739
you're wasting
your time, Detective.

1199
01:10:45,740 --> 01:10:47,361
I've already told you
I have nothing to--

1200
01:10:47,362 --> 01:10:49,935
Is he telling the truth
about the break-in?

1201
01:10:49,936 --> 01:10:51,278
Look, I can't help you,
I'm afraid.

1202
01:10:51,279 --> 01:10:52,227
My reputation is--

1203
01:10:52,228 --> 01:10:53,346
Sod your reputation.

1204
01:10:53,347 --> 01:10:55,148
Is he telling
the truth?

1205
01:10:55,318 --> 01:10:58,933
I have nothing to say.
Now, please leave me alone.

1206
01:11:07,058 --> 01:11:08,622
Is there room for me?

1207
01:11:10,590 --> 01:11:11,863
Look, I'd like
to remind you

1208
01:11:11,864 --> 01:11:13,316
who I am, Detective.

1209
01:11:13,708 --> 01:11:15,241
I'm not going
to be bullied--

1210
01:11:15,242 --> 01:11:17,368
I'm not giving you a choice.
This is a man's life,

1211
01:11:17,369 --> 01:11:19,278
or do you want me to
tell your fancy friends

1212
01:11:19,279 --> 01:11:20,963
what kind of person you are?

1213
01:11:20,964 --> 01:11:22,070
This your coat?

1214
01:11:23,638 --> 01:11:25,611
I had paid Mr. Aaron to arrange

1215
01:11:25,612 --> 01:11:27,898
for myself and a woman
to be photographed together

1216
01:11:27,899 --> 01:11:30,174
to help me...
obtain a divorce.

1217
01:11:32,073 --> 01:11:33,277
He met me at Brighton station,

1218
01:11:33,278 --> 01:11:34,805
and then we went back
to his office

1219
01:11:34,806 --> 01:11:36,259
to sign some papers.

1220
01:11:37,034 --> 01:11:38,624
I immediately noticed
something was wrong,

1221
01:11:38,625 --> 01:11:40,629
the door had been forced open.

1222
01:11:40,630 --> 01:11:43,603
Mr. Aaron checked
in his desk and around,

1223
01:11:43,648 --> 01:11:45,368
but couldn't see anything
missing at the time,

1224
01:11:45,369 --> 01:11:47,064
and we continued with...

1225
01:11:47,568 --> 01:11:48,850
with our business.

1226
01:11:48,932 --> 01:11:51,447
But there were
definite signs of a break-in?

1227
01:11:51,448 --> 01:11:52,961
Yes. Yes, there were.

1228
01:11:54,567 --> 01:11:56,220
You're part
of the prosecution.

1229
01:11:56,221 --> 01:11:57,272
I'm still
not certain--

1230
01:11:57,273 --> 01:12:00,016
You're part of
the prosecution, Frank!

1231
01:12:00,645 --> 01:12:01,791
You can't go
looking for evidence

1232
01:12:01,792 --> 01:12:03,285
for the bloody defense.

1233
01:12:03,286 --> 01:12:04,849
I'm not sure anymore.

1234
01:12:05,069 --> 01:12:07,806
You've got the gun.
What more do you want?

1235
01:12:07,807 --> 01:12:08,791
You know he did it,

1236
01:12:08,792 --> 01:12:11,345
you just don't want
to believe it.

1237
01:12:12,066 --> 01:12:13,658
Waterston knows something.

1238
01:12:13,659 --> 01:12:14,806
What's he got up his sleeve?

1239
01:12:14,807 --> 01:12:16,932
I mean, there's the gun, yes.

1240
01:12:16,933 --> 01:12:18,336
Even the suicide note.

1241
01:12:18,337 --> 01:12:20,373
They're damning,
but they're circumstantial.

1242
01:12:20,374 --> 01:12:22,029
Nothing directly connects you.

1243
01:12:22,030 --> 01:12:23,897
There are
no eyewitnesses,

1244
01:12:24,222 --> 01:12:25,751
so he's got to have
something more.

1245
01:12:25,752 --> 01:12:27,903
But there isn't anything more.

1246
01:12:31,573 --> 01:12:33,766
I went to the hotel that night
to wait for Carlo.

1247
01:12:33,767 --> 01:12:36,791
I was going to drive him home
after the, uh...

1248
01:12:36,792 --> 01:12:37,843
the photograph.

1249
01:12:38,446 --> 01:12:40,994
I was there for about half
an hour when I saw something.

1250
01:12:40,995 --> 01:12:42,139
What did you see?

1251
01:12:42,141 --> 01:12:43,122
I saw someone

1252
01:12:43,188 --> 01:12:45,352
climb over the roof
of the hotel,

1253
01:12:45,353 --> 01:12:46,752
they stopped for a moment,

1254
01:12:46,753 --> 01:12:48,628
and then they climbed
into a window.

1255
01:12:48,629 --> 01:12:49,900
That's the kitchen window,

1256
01:12:49,901 --> 01:12:51,811
that's the third
floor window

1257
01:12:51,812 --> 01:12:53,716
at the front
of the hotel.

1258
01:12:53,717 --> 01:12:54,061
Yes.

1259
01:12:56,491 --> 01:12:58,220
Did you see who it was?

1260
01:12:59,068 --> 01:13:01,067
It was definitely a man,
from their clothes,

1261
01:13:01,068 --> 01:13:02,279
but it was dark.

1262
01:13:02,280 --> 01:13:03,550
I couldn't see
them very well.

1263
01:13:03,551 --> 01:13:05,462
So you have no idea
who it might have been?

1264
01:13:05,463 --> 01:13:07,376
I know exactly who it was.

1265
01:13:07,943 --> 01:13:11,097
You say it was dark,
how can you be so sure?

1266
01:13:11,098 --> 01:13:12,873
Before they went back
inside the hotel,

1267
01:13:12,874 --> 01:13:15,072
they stopped
to light a cigarette.

1268
01:13:15,073 --> 01:13:16,660
Did you see their face
in the light?

1269
01:13:16,661 --> 01:13:17,774
At that distance?

1270
01:13:17,775 --> 01:13:18,528
No, but...

1271
01:13:20,540 --> 01:13:24,014
they had a lighter,
and it didn't work properly,

1272
01:13:24,015 --> 01:13:26,694
so they tapped it
against their hand,

1273
01:13:26,779 --> 01:13:28,530
and then
they shook it twice,

1274
01:13:28,531 --> 01:13:30,505
and then tried to light it.

1275
01:13:31,173 --> 01:13:31,864
It was...

1276
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:35,661
such an individual way
of lighting a cigarette.

1277
01:13:35,662 --> 01:13:37,282
I forgot all about it,

1278
01:13:37,663 --> 01:13:39,065
until I saw Tony Aaron

1279
01:13:39,066 --> 01:13:40,302
do exactly the same thing
with his lighter.

1280
01:13:40,303 --> 01:13:42,628
Liar! She's a liar!
She's making it up!

1281
01:13:42,629 --> 01:13:44,079
Sit down, Mr. Aaron.

1282
01:14:05,158 --> 01:14:08,211
What did she buy,
the woman who was just in here?

1283
01:14:08,212 --> 01:14:10,251
An aeroplane ticket for America.

1284
01:14:10,251 --> 01:14:11,392
Why do you want to know?

1285
01:14:11,393 --> 01:14:12,496
One-way ticket?

1286
01:14:12,983 --> 01:14:13,327
Yes.

1287
01:14:18,134 --> 01:14:20,047
You have seen the evidence.

01:14:22,439 --> 01:14:24,755

01:14:31,295 --> 01:14:33,267
Now, you must be thinking...

1291
01:14:33,566 --> 01:14:35,658
what kind of a person
could commit this atrocity.

1292
01:14:35,659 --> 01:14:38,377
A man thrown out
of the police force,

1293
01:14:39,802 --> 01:14:41,225
who, by his
own confession,

1294
01:14:41,226 --> 01:14:43,724
now makes his living
by fraud and deception.

1295
01:14:43,725 --> 01:14:46,446
A man who has perjured himself
regularly in court

1296
01:14:46,447 --> 01:14:48,119
for the past two years.

1297

I've done things wrong,

01:15:03,844 --> 01:15:05,446
but I didn't do this.

1303
01:15:06,314 --> 01:15:08,429
Somebody stole my gun
and tried to frame me.

1304
01:15:08,430 --> 01:15:09,935
That's what happened.

1305
01:15:11,304 --> 01:15:13,014
Why should I kill my wife?

1306
01:15:13,015 --> 01:15:15,445
I mean,
I could just divorce her.

1307
01:15:16,367 --> 01:15:17,952

1308
01:15:17,953 --> 01:15:20,573
They're saying I killed my wife
for a thousand pounds,

1309
01:15:20,574 --> 01:15:21,969
and then killed
this man as well,

1310
01:15:21,970 --> 01:15:24,517
so that people
wouldn't suspect me?

1311
01:15:24,686 --> 01:15:26,003
It's sick. It's--

like that.

01:27:08,633 --> 01:27:09,507
Oh, America.

1424
01:27:09,846 --> 01:27:10,868
I was going there.

1425
01:27:10,869 --> 01:27:13,197
I didn't quite
make it, though.

1426
01:27:13,327 --> 01:27:14,925
So how much
did she pay you?

1427
01:27:14,926 --> 01:27:15,326
What?

1428
01:27:16,006 --> 01:27:16,531
Selina.

1429
01:27:17,733 --> 01:27:18,600
Please, don't start.

1430
01:27:18,601 --> 01:27:20,031
She's certainly got enough now.

1431
01:27:20,032 --> 01:27:22,075
You should at least get half,
all the risks you've taken.

1432
01:27:22,077 --> 01:27:24,438
You were bound to go to prison
for fixing the divorces.

1433
01:27:24,439 --> 01:27:25,488
That was good.

1434
01:27:25,658 --> 01:27:26,645
That threw people
off the scent.

1435
01:27:26,646 --> 01:27:27,986
You thought, "Six months
for double murder,

1436
01:27:27,987 --> 01:27:28,944
that can't be bad."

1437
01:27:28,945 --> 01:27:30,064
I didn't come here for this.

1438
01:27:30,065 --> 01:27:32,488
You...
searching through my things,

1439
01:27:32,489 --> 01:27:33,956
looking for evidence.

1440
01:27:34,215 --> 01:27:35,148
You remember?

1441
01:27:35,174 --> 01:27:36,398
Sure. I remember.

1442
01:27:38,434 --> 01:27:41,084
But you weren't searching
for evidence, were you?

1443
01:27:41,085 --> 01:27:43,890
You were planting it
for Frank to find.

1444
01:27:43,891 --> 01:27:46,960
You only got to know me
so you could set me up.

1445
01:27:46,961 --> 01:27:48,197
Goodbye, Angeline.

1446
01:27:50,508 --> 01:27:53,359
Then who killed them
if it wasn't you?

1447
01:27:54,591 --> 01:27:55,228
You did.

1448
01:27:56,189 --> 01:27:57,565
And you're still trying

1449
01:27:57,566 --> 01:27:58,875
to drag somebody down
with you, even now.

1450
01:27:58,876 --> 01:28:00,405
You killed him. That's
why you're doing life.

1451
01:28:00,406 --> 01:28:01,525
Think yourself lucky
you're not a man.

1452
01:28:01,526 --> 01:28:02,649
They would have hanged you
by now.

1453
01:28:02,650 --> 01:28:04,688
Oh, I'll think myself lucky.

1454
01:28:05,455 --> 01:28:06,201
Don't go.

1455
01:28:06,413 --> 01:28:08,326
I've got a boat to catch.

1456
01:28:08,458 --> 01:28:09,320
I miss you.

1457
01:28:11,271 --> 01:28:12,834
I miss you every day.

1458
01:28:14,977 --> 01:28:18,012
I'm-- I'm sorry
nothing turned out right.

1459
01:28:18,649 --> 01:28:20,626
Tony, you have to
tell me.

1460
01:28:21,043 --> 01:28:23,344
I'm going to go crazy in here
not knowing for sure.

1461
01:28:23,345 --> 01:28:24,981
Please... just tell me.

1462
01:28:25,450 --> 01:28:26,661
No one
will believe me,

1463
01:28:26,662 --> 01:28:28,289
no matter
what I say.

1464
01:28:29,282 --> 01:28:30,612
I've got to know.

1465
01:28:32,668 --> 01:28:34,123
Just tell me once...

1466
01:28:36,821 --> 01:28:37,917
Did you do it?

1467
01:28:47,808 --> 01:28:48,441
Did you?

1468
01:28:52,726 --> 01:28:53,310
Whisper.

1469
01:28:55,765 --> 01:28:56,395
Did you?

1470
01:28:59,120 --> 01:29:00,214
Did you do it?

1471
01:29:36,583 --> 01:29:37,330
Is he in?

1472
01:29:44,154 --> 01:29:47,032
I've only put
30 paintings on the market,

1473
01:29:47,033 --> 01:29:48,719
but I could sell the lot.

1474
01:29:48,720 --> 01:29:49,486
Everything.

1475
01:29:50,030 --> 01:29:51,893
I want to wait a while...

1476
01:29:52,430 --> 01:29:54,116
until the prices go up.

1477
01:30:01,851 --> 01:30:04,000
We're going
to be very rich.

1478
01:30:05,013 --> 01:30:07,374
You know, I might
make you an offer

1479
01:30:07,375 --> 01:30:09,126
for your Stasio one day.

1480
01:30:11,115 --> 01:30:12,645
You said she was
only after his money,

1481
01:30:12,646 --> 01:30:13,805
but she wasn't.

1482
01:30:16,863 --> 01:30:19,034
She just wanted to be somebody.

1483
01:30:19,035 --> 01:30:19,787
Who cares?

1484
01:30:20,789 --> 01:30:22,700
She's out of the way now.

1485
01:30:26,284 --> 01:30:27,816
You fell in love with her,
didn't you?

1486
01:30:27,817 --> 01:30:30,021
That's why
you waited so long

1487
01:30:30,022 --> 01:30:31,396
to plant the evidence.

1488
01:30:31,397 --> 01:30:31,676
No.

1489
01:30:33,246 --> 01:30:35,061
No, it was just business.

1490
01:30:42,670 --> 01:30:43,711
Come on, Tony.

1491
01:30:44,300 --> 01:30:47,178
You've got everything
you always wanted.
