00:00:41,142 --> 00:00:44,389
BAKER: Once upon a time-in
a far-off kingdom-

3
00:00:44,509 --> 00:00:48,050
there lay a small village at
the edge of the woods...

4
00:00:50,442 --> 00:00:53,434
CINDERELLA: I WISH...
And in this village...

5
00:00:53,435 --> 00:00:56,571
CINDERELLA: MORE THAN ANYTHING...
...lived a young maiden...

6
00:00:56,713 --> 00:01:02,325
CINDERELLA: MORE THAN LIFE... MORE THAN JEWELS...
...a care-free young lad...

7
00:01:03,493 --> 00:01:05,501
I WISH...

8
00:01:05,661 --> 00:01:10,210
MORE THAN LIFE...
...and a childless baker...

9
00:01:10,361 --> 00:01:12,971
I WISH...
...with his Wife.

10
00:01:13,738 --> 00:01:16,139
MORE THAN ANYTHING...
MORE THAN THE MOON...

11
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:19,423
I WISH...
THE KING IS GIVING A FESTIVAL.

12
00:01:19,552 --> 00:01:21,763
MORE THAN LIFE...
I WISH... I WISH TO GO TO THE FESTIVAL

13
00:01:22,294 --> 00:01:23,934
MORE THAN RICHES...
AND THE BALL... I WISH

14
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:26,493
MY COW WOULD GIVE US SOME MILK.
MORE THAN ANYTHING...

15
00:01:26,621 --> 00:01:30,505
I WISH WE HAD A CHILD

16
00:01:31,251 --> 00:01:35,105
I WISH TO GO TO THE FESTIVAL MY COW WOULD
GIVE US SOME MILK OR EVEN CHEESE... I WISH.

17
00:01:38,984 --> 00:01:42,264
STEPMOTHER: YOU WISH TO GO TO THE FESTIVAL?
BAKER: The poor girl’s parents had died

18
00:01:42,366 --> 00:01:46,447
YOU, CINDERELLA, THE FESTIVAL?
YOU WISH TO GO TO THE FESTIVAL?

19
00:01:46,473 --> 00:01:48,998
THE FESTIVAL?! THE
KING’S FESTIVAL!??

20
00:01:49,102 --> 00:01:51,269
BAKER: And now she lived with her
stepmother...

21
00:01:51,397 --> 00:01:53,565
THE FESTIVAL?!!!

22
00:01:53,676 --> 00:01:55,790
BAKER: ...who had two daughters of her own.

23
00:01:56,881 --> 00:01:58,992
FLORINDA: LOOK AT YOUR NAILS!
LUCINDA: LOOK AT YOUR DRESS!

24
00:01:59,161 --> 00:02:00,678
STEPMOTHER: PEOPLE WOULD LAUGH AT YOU!
CINDERELLA: NEVERTHELESS

25
00:02:00,813 --> 00:02:02,343
STEPMOTHER/STEPSISTERS/CINDERELLA: SHE/YOU/I
STILL WANT(S)/ WISH TO GO THE FESTIVAL...

26
00:02:02,496 --> 00:02:04,474
AND DANCE BEFORE THE
PRINCE?!

27
00:02:07,809 --> 00:02:11,757
BAKER: All three were beautiful of face,
but vile and black of heart.

28
00:02:13,951 --> 00:02:15,791
The young lad had no father,

29
00:02:15,918 --> 00:02:17,953
and his mother...
I WISH.

30
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,991
BAKER: Well, she was at her wit’s end.

31
00:02:20,103 --> 00:02:21,913
JACK’S MOTHER: I WISH
MY SON WERE NOT A FOOL.

32
00:02:23,298 --> 00:02:26,588
I WISH MY HOUSE WAS NOT A MESS.

33
00:02:26,703 --> 00:02:29,466
I WISH THE COW WAS FULL OF MILK.

34
00:02:29,596 --> 00:02:31,338
I WISH THE WALLS WERE FULL OF GOLD.

35
00:02:31,472 --> 00:02:33,857
I WISH A LOT OF THINGS.

36
00:02:34,009 --> 00:02:37,809
- What in heaven’s name are you doing
with the cow inside the house?

37
00:02:37,937 --> 00:02:40,417
- I thought if he was nice and warm
he might produce some milk.

38
00:02:40,692 --> 00:02:46,260
- It’s a she! How many times must I tell you?
Only shes can give milk!

39
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:53,421
BAKER: And then there was
a hungry little girl...

40
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:55,755
who always wore a red cape...
BAKER: Hey!

41
00:02:55,898 --> 00:03:00,608
I WISH. IT’S NOT FOR ME, IT’S
FOR MY GRANNY IN THE WOODS.

42
00:03:01,367 --> 00:03:07,002
A LOAF OF BREAD, PLEASE, TO BRING MY
POOR OLD HUNGRY GRANNY IN THE WOODS...

43
00:03:07,114 --> 00:03:09,105
JUST A LOAF OF BREAD...

44
00:03:09,225 --> 00:03:11,049
PLEASE.

45
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:21,583
- if you can pick up these lentils
and finish your chores in time,

46
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:24,049
-then you may go to the ball with us.

47
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,846
Come along, ladies...
STEPSISTERS: Yes, Mother.

48
00:03:28,206 --> 00:03:30,493
GOOD LUCK!

49
00:03:41,245 --> 00:03:48,998
CINDERELLA: COME LITTLE BIRDS, DOWN FROM THE EAVES AND
THE LEAVES, OVER FIELDS, OUT OF CASTLES AND PONDS...

50
00:03:50,566 --> 00:03:54,091
AHHHHH...
JACK: NO, SQUEEZE, PAL...

51
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:14,042
CINDERELLA: QUICK, LITTLE
BIRDS, FLICK THROUGH THE ASHES.

52
00:04:14,178 --> 00:04:17,158
PICK AND PECK,
BUT SWIFTLY, SIFT THROUGH THE ASHES.

53
00:04:17,326 --> 00:04:19,964
INTO THE POT...

54
00:04:23,003 --> 00:04:25,473
- Bullseye!
- What are you doing?

55
00:04:25,586 --> 00:04:27,680
-Stop your pretending!

56
00:04:27,808 --> 00:04:32,017
- Now listen to me well, son.
Milky-White must be taken to market.

57
00:04:32,137 --> 00:04:33,897
- Mother, no! he’s the
best cow in the world!

58
00:04:33,934 --> 00:04:38,763
- Was. She’s been dry for weeks. We’ve no
food or money and no choice but to sell her.

59
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:40,875
- But Milky-White is my best friend!
- Look at her!

60
00:04:42,343 --> 00:04:44,574
THERE ARE BUGS ON HER DUGS.

61
00:04:44,735 --> 00:04:46,968
THERE ARE FLIES IN HER EYES.

62
00:04:47,611 --> 00:04:51,228
THERE’S A LUMP ON HER RUMP
BIG ENOUGH TO BE A HUMP!
But...

63
00:04:51,396 --> 00:04:53,952
JACK’S MOTHER: WE’VE NO
TIME TO SIT AND DITHER

64
00:04:54,096 --> 00:04:56,666
WHILE HER WITHERS WITHER WITH HER...

65
00:04:56,818 --> 00:04:59,686
AND NO ONE KEEPS A COW FOR A FRIEND!

66
00:04:59,781 --> 00:05:02,322
- Sometimes I wonder
what’s in that head of yours.

67
00:05:07,156 --> 00:05:08,842
LRRH: INTO THE WOODS, IT’S TIME TO GO

68
00:05:08,967 --> 00:05:10,645
I HATE TO LEAVE, I HAVE TO, THOUGH.

69
00:05:10,789 --> 00:05:13,952
INTO THE WOODS. IT’S TIME, AND SO I
MUST BEGIN MY JOURNEY.

70
00:05:14,119 --> 00:05:18,074
INTO THE WOODS AND THROUGH THE TREES
TO WHERE I AM EXPECTED, MA’AM.

71
00:05:18,217 --> 00:05:20,205
INTO THE WOODS TO GRANDMOTHER’S HOUSE...

72
00:05:20,373 --> 00:05:24,058
LRRH:(with her mouth full)
INTO THE WOODS TO GRANDMOTHER’S
HOUSE...

73
00:05:24,195 --> 00:05:25,316
-You’re certain of your way?

74
00:05:25,388 --> 00:05:32,317
LRRH: THE WAY IS CLEAR. THE LIGHT IS GOOD,
I HAVE NO FEAR, NOR NO ONE SHOULD.

75
00:05:32,445 --> 00:05:36,098
THE WOODS ARE JUST TREES,
THE TREESARE JUST WOOD.

76
00:05:36,266 --> 00:05:40,258
I SORT OF HATE TO ASK IT,
BUT DO YOU HAVE A BASKET?

77
00:05:40,418 --> 00:05:44,237
- I don’t suppose you’re planning on
buying any of these?

78
00:05:44,692 --> 00:05:48,699
-Now, don’t stray and be late!
-And you might save some of those
sweets for Granny.

79
00:05:49,499 --> 00:05:51,689
- Oh my G...
she's a...

80
00:05:52,678 --> 00:05:56,443
LRRH: INTO THE WOODS AND DOWN THE DELL,
THE PATH IS STRAIGHT, I KNOW IT WELL.

81
00:05:56,565 --> 00:05:59,496
INTO THE WOODS, AND WHO CAN TELL
WHAT’S WAITING ON THE JOURNEY?

82
00:05:59,656 --> 00:06:03,657
INTO THE WOODS TO BRING SOME BREAD TO
GRANNY WHO IS SICK IN BED.

83
00:06:03,784 --> 00:06:07,618
NEVER CAN TELL WHAT LIES AHEAD,
FOR ALL THAT KNOW, SHE’S ALREADY DEAD.

84
00:06:08,393 --> 00:06:14,441
BUT INTO THE WOODS, INTO THE WOODS,
INTO THE WOODS TO GRANDMOTHER’S
HOUSE AND HOME BEFORE DARK!

85
00:06:21,744 --> 00:06:24,332
LUCINDA: Cinderella!
FLORINDA: Get up here!

86
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:29,614
FLY BIRDS, BACK TO THE SKY,

87
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:32,494
BACK TO THE EAVES AND THE LEAVES AND
THE FIELDS AND THE...

88
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:37,618
HURRY UP AND DO MY HAIR, CINDERELLA!
ARE YOU REALLY WEARING THAT?

89
00:06:37,746 --> 00:06:41,259
HERE, I FOUND A LITTLE TEAR,
CINDERELLA! CAN’T YOU HIDE IT WITH A HAT?

90
00:06:41,412 --> 00:06:43,505
YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL.
- I know.

91
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:45,682
- She means me.
- No, she didn’t!

92
00:06:45,826 --> 00:06:47,288
CINDERELLA: MOTHER SAID BE GOOD,
FATHER SAID BE NICE,

93
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:51,262
THAT WAS ALWAYS THEIR ADVICE.
SO BE NICE, CINDERELLA, GOOD,
CINDERELLA, NICE

94
00:06:51,775 --> 00:06:52,962
GOOD GOOD NICE...
- Tighter!

95
00:06:53,523 --> 00:06:55,670
WHAT’S THE GOOD OF BEING GOOD
IF EVERYONE IS BLIND

96
00:06:55,806 --> 00:06:58,535
ALWAYS LEAVING YOU
BEHIND? NEVER MIND,

97
00:06:58,689 --> 00:07:01,520
CINDERELLA, KIND CINDERELLA,
NICE-GOOD-NICE-KIND-GOOD-NICE

98
00:07:02,578 --> 00:07:05,071
-Ow! Not that tight! Clod!

99
00:07:16,667 --> 00:07:20,018
- Who might that be?
- We’ve sold our last loaf of bread!

100
00:07:22,386 --> 00:07:24,843
-It’s the Witch from next door!

101
00:07:33,869 --> 00:07:37,310
- We have no bread.
- I don’t want your bread.

102
00:07:37,423 --> 00:07:40,844
- Then what is it you wish?
- It’s not what I wish. It’s what you wish.

103
00:07:40,974 --> 00:07:44,322
Nothing cooking in that belly now,
is there?

104
00:07:44,456 --> 00:07:50,832
And there will never be...
Unless you do exactly as I say.

105
00:07:52,302 --> 00:07:55,675
In three days’ time, a
Blue Moon will appear.

106
00:07:55,820 --> 00:08:00,250
Only then can the curse be undone.

107
00:08:00,363 --> 00:08:02,514
What curse?

108
00:08:02,635 --> 00:08:05,115
- The one I placed on this house!
- What are you talking about?

109
00:08:07,057 --> 00:08:11,229
In the past, when you were no more
than a babe,

110
00:08:11,357 --> 00:08:16,093
your father brought his
young wife and you to this cottage.

111
00:08:16,221 --> 00:08:20,319
They were a lovely couple.
But not lovely neighbors.

112
00:08:21,276 --> 00:08:23,759
You see, your mother...

113
00:08:23,895 --> 00:08:29,465
was with child and she developed an
unusual appetite.

114
00:08:29,608 --> 00:08:32,289
She admired my beautiful garden...

115
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:38,242
and she told your father that
what she wanted, more than anything...

116
00:08:38,363 --> 00:08:42,121
in the world was...
GREENS, GREENS, AND NOTHING BUT GREENS:

117
00:08:42,267 --> 00:08:47,652
PARSLEY, PEPPERS, CABBAGES AND CELERY. ASPARAGUS
AND WATERCRESS AND FIDDLEFERNS AND LETTUCE...!

118
00:08:47,772 --> 00:08:52,891
HE SAID, “ALL RIGHT,” BUT IT WASN’T, QUITE,
‘CAUSE I CAUGHT HIM IN THE AUTUMN
IN MY GARDEN ONE NIGHT!

119
00:08:58,155 --> 00:09:03,957
HE WAS ROBBING ME, RAPING ME,
ROOTING THROUGH MY RUTABAGA,
RAIDING MY ARUGULA.

120
00:09:04,077 --> 00:09:08,818
AND RIPPING UP THE RAMPION
MY CHAMPION! MY FAVORITE!
I SHOULD HAVE LAID A SPELL ON HIM
RIGHT THERE...

121
00:09:10,439 --> 00:09:13,417
I COULD HAVE TURNED HIM INTO STONE

122
00:09:13,617 --> 00:09:18,417
OR A DOG OR A CHAIR...

123
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:24,912
BUT I LET HIM HAVE THE RAMPION
I’D LOTS TO SPARE.
IN RETURN, HOWEVER,

124
00:09:25,046 --> 00:09:28,827
I SAID, “FAIR IS FAIR: YOU CAN LET ME
HAVE THE BABY THAT YOUR WIFE WILL BEAR,

125
00:09:30,148 --> 00:09:31,783
AND WE’LL CALL IT SQUARE.”

126
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,543
- I had a brother?
- No.

127
00:09:35,663 --> 00:09:38,438
But you had a sister.

128
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:40,006
-Where is she?

129
00:09:40,118 --> 00:09:41,838
She’s mine...

130
00:09:42,532 --> 00:09:44,983
now and you’ll never find her!

131
00:09:45,103 --> 00:09:48,787
Small price to pay for what else
your father stole from me.

132
00:09:48,923 --> 00:09:56,923
It cost me my youth, my beauty. My mother warned me she would
punish me with the curse of ugliness if I ever lost them.

133
00:09:58,403 --> 00:10:00,970
- Lost what?
- The beans!

134
00:10:00,971 --> 00:10:05,410
Beans?
THE SPECIAL BEANS!
I LET HIM GO, I DIDN’T KNOW
HE’D STOLEN MY BEANS!

135
00:10:05,537 --> 00:10:11,007
I WAS WATCHING HIM CRAWL BACK
OVER THE WALL, WHEN BANG! CRASH!
THE LIGHTNING FLASH!

136
00:10:21,403 --> 00:10:24,447
WELL, THAT’S ANOTHER STORY...
NEVER MIND. ANYWAY,

137
00:10:24,562 --> 00:10:26,420
AT LAST THE BIG DAY CAME

138
00:10:26,531 --> 00:10:29,611
AND I MADE MY CLAIM ”OH, DON’T TAKE AWAY
THE BABY” THEY SHRIEKEDAND SCREECHED,

139
00:10:29,728 --> 00:10:32,535
BUT I DID, AND I HID HER WHERE SHE’LL
NEVER BE REACHED.

140
00:10:32,651 --> 00:10:35,293
AND YOUR FATHER CRIED
AND YOUR MOTHER DIED

141
00:10:35,421 --> 00:10:39,517
WHEN FOR EXTRA MEASURE...
I ADMIT IT WAS A PLEASURE...
I SAID, “SORRY, I’M STILL NOT MOLLIFIED.”

142
00:10:39,645 --> 00:10:42,550
AND I LAID A LITTLE SPELL ON THEM...

143
00:10:42,678 --> 00:10:50,678
YOU TOO, SON... THAT YOUR FAMILY TREE
WOULD ALWAYS BE A BARREN ONE...

144
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:57,399
- How could you do that to me?
- And when your mother died...

145
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:01,668
...your father deserted you.
Your father was no father...

146
00:11:01,804 --> 00:11:06,557
...so why should you be?
- I’m so sorry...

147
00:11:07,258 --> 00:11:13,694
- I’m so sorry... NOW THERE’S NO MORE FUSS AND THERE’S NO MORE
SCENES AND MY GARDEN THRIVES. YOU SHOULD SEE MY NECTARINES!

148
00:11:14,694 --> 00:11:20,425
BUT I’M TELLING YOU THE SAME I TELL KINGS AND QUEENS:
DON’T EVER NEVER EVER MESS AROUND WITH MY GREENS!

149
00:11:20,426 --> 00:11:22,002
ESPECIALLY THE BEANS.

150
00:11:25,188 --> 00:11:28,647
- Why do I have to go to the next village?
- Because everyone in this village...

151
00:11:28,759 --> 00:11:31,799
...knows the cow hasn’t given a drop of milk in weeks.
- But that’s cheating.

152
00:11:32,167 --> 00:11:35,301
- We’re starving, Jack.
Don’t you understand that?

153
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:40,132
- Now, You’re not to take less
than five pounds for her.

154
00:11:40,243 --> 00:11:42,867
- Are you listening to me?
- Yes.

155
00:11:42,988 --> 00:11:45,565
- How much are you to ask?
- No more than five pounds.

156
00:11:45,701 --> 00:11:48,557
- Less! Than five.
- ... than five!

157
00:11:48,669 --> 00:11:52,212
INTO THE WOODS, THE TIME IS NOW. WE
HAVE TO LIVE, I DON’T CARE HOW.

158
00:11:52,694 --> 00:11:56,264
INTO THE WOODS TO SELL THE COW, YOU MUST
BEGIN THE JOURNEY.

159
00:11:56,408 --> 00:11:58,246
STRAIGHT THROUGH
THE WOODS AND DON’T DELAY

160
00:11:58,382 --> 00:12:00,409
WE HAVE TO
FACE THE MARKETPLACE

161
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:03,070
INTO THE WOODS
TO JOURNEY’S END...

162
00:12:03,953 --> 00:12:06,252
INTO THE WOODS TO SELL A FRIEND...

163
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:12,359
YOU WISH TO HAVE THE CURSE REVERSED?

164
00:12:13,035 --> 00:12:18,281
I’LL NEED A CERTAIN POTION FIRST.
GO TO THE WOOD AND BRING ME BACK

165
00:12:18,433 --> 00:12:21,948
ONE:
THE COW AS WHITE AS MILK,

166
00:12:22,713 --> 00:12:26,314
TWO: THE CAPE AS RED AS BLOOD,

167
00:12:26,315 --> 00:12:30,419
THREE: THE HAIR
AS YELLOW AS CORN,

168
00:12:30,555 --> 00:12:35,123
FOUR: THE SLIPPER
AS PURE AS GOLD.

169
00:12:36,065 --> 00:12:40,327
BRING ME THESE
BEFORE THE CHIME OF MIDNIGHT...

170
00:12:40,447 --> 00:12:44,431
IN THREE DAYS’ TIME, ‘TIS
THEN THE BLUE MOON REAPPEARS,

171
00:12:44,576 --> 00:12:49,301
WHICH COMES BUT ONCE EACH
HUNDRED YEARS. BRING THEM...

172
00:12:49,413 --> 00:12:54,349
AND I GUARANTEE, A CHILD AS PERFECT AS
CHILD CAN BE.

173
00:12:56,396 --> 00:12:59,462
-Go to the wood!

174
00:13:10,992 --> 00:13:13,269
-Ladies. Our carriage awaits!

175
00:13:13,401 --> 00:13:15,403
NOW MAY I GO TO THE FESTIVAL?

176
00:13:15,532 --> 00:13:18,823
The Festival! DARLING, THOSE NAILS!
DARLING, THOSE CLOTHES!

177
00:13:18,824 --> 00:13:23,823
LENTILS ARE ONE THING, BUT DARLING, WITH THOSE, YOU’D
MAKE US THE FOOLS OF THE FESTIVAL AND MORTIFY THE PRINCE!

178
00:13:25,687 --> 00:13:28,988
-The festival lasts three nights.
Surely you can let me be there for one
of them.

179
00:13:29,123 --> 00:13:31,612
The King is trying to find his son a
wife...

180
00:13:31,764 --> 00:13:35,373
not a scullery maid! We must
be gone!

181
00:13:41,117 --> 00:13:42,974
-Go!

182
00:13:43,865 --> 00:13:45,973
I WISH

183
00:13:48,524 --> 00:13:51,111
-I found. Here. Take this...

184
00:13:51,239 --> 00:13:53,462
- I’m not wearing that.
- Why?

185
00:13:53,589 --> 00:13:55,726
It was my father’s. You heard what she
said.

186
00:13:55,837 --> 00:13:57,917
This is all his fault.
I want nothing to do with him!

187
00:13:59,562 --> 00:14:01,633
Beans.

188
00:14:03,258 --> 00:14:05,310
It must be the Witch’s beans!

189
00:14:05,429 --> 00:14:07,777
We’ll take them with us.
- We?

190
00:14:07,903 --> 00:14:09,413
Wait a minute!

191
00:14:09,549 --> 00:14:11,949
- You’re not coming. It’s not safe out there.
- I can help you.

192
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:14,513
No. I can do this on my own.

193
00:14:14,633 --> 00:14:17,773
THE SPELL IS ON MY HOUSE. ONLY I CAN LIFT
THE SPELL, THE SPELL IS ON MY HOUSE.

194
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:22,773
NO, NO, THE SPELL IS ON OUR HOUSE. WE MUST LIFT
THE SPELL TOGETHER, THE SPELL IS ON OUR HOUSE.

195
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:25,224
Now tell me. What am I to return with?

196
00:14:25,361 --> 00:14:27,729
You don’t remember?!

197
00:14:27,842 --> 00:14:28,403
THE COW AS WHITE AS MILK,

198
00:14:28,629 --> 00:14:30,201
THE CAPE AS
RED AS BLOOD,

199
00:14:30,328 --> 00:14:32,920
THE HAIR AS YELLOW AS
CORN, THE SLIPPER AS PURE AS GOLD.

200
00:14:33,064 --> 00:14:35,420
THE COW AS WHITE AS MILK, THE CAPE AS
RED AS BLOOD,

201
00:14:35,556 --> 00:14:36,820
THE HAIR AS YELLOW AS
CORN,

202
00:14:36,956 --> 00:14:38,183
THE SLIPPER AS PURE AS GOLD.

203
00:14:38,311 --> 00:14:40,694
I STILL WISH TO GO TO THE FESTIVAL,

204
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:43,132
BUT HOW AM I EVER TO GET TO THE
FESTIVAL?

205
00:14:43,254 --> 00:14:46,126
I KNOW... I’LL VISIT MOTHER’S
GRAVE, THE GRAVE AT THE
WILLOW TREE,

206
00:14:46,269 --> 00:14:48,579
AND TELL HER I
JUST WANT TO GO TO THE KING’S
FESTIVAL...

207
00:14:49,231 --> 00:14:52,636
INTO THE WOODS, IT’S TIME TO GO, IT
MAY BE ALL IN VAIN, YOU (I) KNOW.

208
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:56,140
INTO THE WOODS... BUT EVEN SO, I HAVE
TO TAKE THE JOURNEY.

209
00:14:56,275 --> 00:14:59,334
-INTO THE WOODS/ THE PATH IS STRAIGHT,
YOU KNOW IT WELL,
-BUT WHO CAN TELL...?

210
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:02,539
INTO THE WOODS TO LIFT THE SPELL...

211
00:15:03,735 --> 00:15:06,241
INTO THE WOODS TO VISIT MOTHER...

212
00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:09,820
-INTO THE WOODS TO SELL THE COW...

213
00:15:09,964 --> 00:15:13,175
- TO GET THE MONEY!...
- TO GO THE FESTIVAL...

214
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:17,828
INTO THE WOODS TO GRANDMOTHER’S
HOUSE...

215
00:15:17,996 --> 00:15:20,684
INTO THE WOODS TO
GRANDMOTHER’S HOUSE...

216
00:15:21,756 --> 00:15:25,185
THE WAY IS CLEAR, THE LIGHT IS GOOD.

217
00:15:25,339 --> 00:15:28,852
I HAVE NO FEAR, NOR NO ONE SHOULD.

218
00:15:29,009 --> 00:15:32,163
THE WOODS ARE JUST TREES,
THE TREES ARE JUST WOOD.

219
00:15:32,315 --> 00:15:36,690
NO NEED TO BE AFRAID THERE...
THERE’S SOMETHING IN THE GLADE THERE.

220
00:15:43,793 --> 00:15:47,090
INTO THE WOODS WITHOUT DELAY, BUT
CAREFUL NOT TO LOSE THE WAY.

221
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:50,386
INTO THE WOODS, WHO KNOWS WHAT
MAY BE LURKING ON THE JOURNEY?

222
00:15:50,507 --> 00:15:54,163
INTO THE WOODS TO GET THE THING
THAT MAKES IT WORTH THE JOURNEYING.

223
00:15:54,331 --> 00:15:56,715
INTO THE WOODS
TO SEE THE KING...
TO SELL THE COW...

224
00:15:56,837 --> 00:15:58,877
TO MAKE THE POTION...
TO SEE... TO SELL... TO GET...

225
00:15:58,954 --> 00:16:02,458
TO
BRING TO MAKE... TO LIFT... TO GO TO
THE FESTIVAL...! INTO THE WOODS!

226
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:09,400
INTO THE WOODS! INTO
THE WOODS,

227
00:16:14,275 --> 00:16:17,572
THEN OUT OF THE WOODS,
AND HOME BEFORE DARK!

228
00:16:29,014 --> 00:16:30,875
BAKER: Deep within the woods,

229
00:16:31,003 --> 00:16:34,747
Cinderella had planted a branch
at the grave of her mother.

230
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:38,297
And she visited there so
often, and wept so much,

231
00:16:38,457 --> 00:16:43,143
that her tears watered it until
it had become a magnificent tree.

232
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:52,278
I WISH...

233
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:57,079
C’S MOTHER: What is it
that you wish, child?

234
00:17:00,131 --> 00:17:05,819
DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU WISH? ARE YOU
CERTAIN WHAT YOU WISH IS WHAT YOU
WANT?

235
00:17:06,715 --> 00:17:11,588
IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU WANT,
THEN MAKE A WISH...

236
00:17:12,216 --> 00:17:16,465
ASK THE TREE,

237
00:17:16,609 --> 00:17:24,609
AND YOU SHALL HAVE YOUR WISH.

238
00:17:49,091 --> 00:17:51,165
Thank you, Mother.

239
00:18:13,807 --> 00:18:18,165
On her path to Granny’s, the little
girl suddenly found herself...

240
00:18:18,277 --> 00:18:21,235
in a very unusual part of the wood.

241
00:18:30,888 --> 00:18:32,559
WOLF: Good day, young lady.

242
00:18:33,846 --> 00:18:35,520
-Good day, Mr. Wolf.

243
00:18:36,585 --> 00:18:40,247
- Whither away so hurriedly?
- To my Grandmother’s.

244
00:18:41,451 --> 00:18:45,146
- And what might be in your basket?
- It’s bread for Grandmother...

245
00:18:45,274 --> 00:18:48,929
so she’ll have something
good to make her strong.

246
00:18:49,089 --> 00:18:53,716
- And where might your Grandmother live?
- A quarter of a league further in the woods;

247
00:18:53,844 --> 00:18:55,980
her house stands inside a great oak tree.

248
00:19:11,771 --> 00:19:13,771
MMMMH... UNHH...

249
00:19:15,627 --> 00:19:19,771
LOOK AT THAT FLESH,
PINK AND PLUMP.

250
00:19:19,891 --> 00:19:23,125
HELLO, LITTLE GIRL...

251
00:19:23,126 --> 00:19:30,125
TENDER AND FRESH, NOT ONE LUMP.
HELLO, LITTLE GIRL...

252
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:35,125
THIS ONE’S ESPECIALLY LUSH,

253
00:19:36,309 --> 00:19:38,330
DELICIOUS...

254
00:19:38,507 --> 00:19:40,651
HELLO, LITTLE GIRL,

255
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:44,919
WHAT’S YOUR RUSH?
YOU’RE MISSING ALL THE
FLOWERS.

256
00:19:46,163 --> 00:19:48,818
THE SUN WON’T SET FOR
HOURS,

257
00:19:48,978 --> 00:19:51,342
TAKE YOUR TIME.
MOTHER SAID, ”STRAIGHT AHEAD,” NOT
TO DELAY

258
00:19:51,486 --> 00:19:54,736
OR BE MISLED.
BUT SLOW, LITTLE GIRL,

259
00:19:55,403 --> 00:19:59,630
HARK! AND HUSH-
THE BIRDS ARE SINGING SWEETLY.

260
00:19:59,773 --> 00:20:02,926
YOU’LL MISS THE BIRDS COMPLETELY,

261
00:20:03,726 --> 00:20:07,225
YOU’RE TRAVELLING SO FLEETLY.

262
00:20:07,361 --> 00:20:13,966
GRANDMOTHER FIRST, THEN MISS PLUMP...
WHAT A DELECTABLE COUPLE.

263
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:18,596
UTTER PERFECTION: ONE BRITTLE, ONE
SUPPLE... ONE MOMENT, MY DEAR...
MOTHER SAID, ”COME WHAT MAY,

264
00:20:18,724 --> 00:20:21,544
FOLLOW
THE PATH AND NEVER STRAY.”

265
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:26,724
JUST SO, LITTLE GIRL... ANY PATH.
SO MANY WORTH EXPLORING.

266
00:20:28,113 --> 00:20:31,306
JUST ONE
WOULD BE SO BORING.

267
00:20:31,434 --> 00:20:34,438
AND LOOK WHAT
YOU’RE IGNORING...

268
00:20:35,402 --> 00:20:41,900
THINK OF THOSE CRISP, AGING BONES,
THEN SOMETHING FRESH ON THE PALATE.

269
00:20:42,069 --> 00:20:47,563
THINK OF THAT SCRUMPTIOUS CARNALITY/
TWICE IN ONE DAY...

270
00:20:47,683 --> 00:20:50,926
THERE’S NO
POSSIBLE WAY

271
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:54,017
TO DESCRIBE WHAT YOU
FEEL

272
00:20:54,018 --> 00:20:56,300
WHEN YOU’RE TALKING TO YOUR
MEAL!

273
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:03,716
For Granny.

274
00:21:03,844 --> 00:21:08,009
MOTHER SAID NOT TO STRAY. STILL, I
SUPPOSE, A SMALL DELAY...

275
00:21:09,421 --> 00:21:11,844
GRANNY MIGHT LIKE A FRESH BOUQUET...

276
00:21:13,716 --> 00:21:17,080
- Goodbye, Mr. Wolf.
- Goodbye, little girl.

277
00:21:19,592 --> 00:21:22,312
AND HELLO...

278
00:21:44,679 --> 00:21:47,901
- Why are you waiting for?! Go get the cape!
- You frightened me!

279
00:21:49,362 --> 00:21:50,768
Get it! Get it! Get it!

280
00:21:50,834 --> 00:21:53,365
- How am I supposed to get it?
- You go up to the...

281
00:21:53,483 --> 00:21:56,003
-little thing, and you
take it.
-I can’t just take a cloak from a

282
00:21:56,122 --> 00:21:57,544
little girl. Why don’t you take it!

283
00:21:57,671 --> 00:22:01,006
It’s the rules. Why do you think I
asked you in the first place?

284
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:04,294
I’m not allowed to touch
any of the objects!

285
00:22:13,324 --> 00:22:16,375
Get me what I need!

286
00:22:16,487 --> 00:22:18,990
Get me what I need!

287
00:22:28,248 --> 00:22:29,876
Hello there little girl.

288
00:22:30,012 --> 00:22:34,017
-Hello, Mr. Baker.
-Have you saved some of those sweets
for Granny?

289
00:22:34,156 --> 00:22:36,737
I ate all the sweets and half the loaf
of bread.

290
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:40,959
So I see! Now tell me... where did you
get that beautiful cape?

291
00:22:41,087 --> 00:22:43,174
- My Granny made it for me.
- Is that right?

292
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:47,321
-I would love a red cape
like that.
-You’d look pretty foolish.

293
00:22:48,896 --> 00:22:52,426
May I take a look at it?

294
00:22:52,427 --> 00:22:54,158
- No!
- I need it badly.

295
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:56,054
Please... give it back!

296
00:22:57,234 --> 00:22:59,500
Aaa.

297
00:23:04,723 --> 00:23:10,819
I’m sorry. I just wanted to make sure
that you really loved this cape.

298
00:23:10,985 --> 00:23:16,395
Now off you go to Granny’s... and be
careful that no wolf comes your way.

299
00:23:16,523 --> 00:23:19,876
I would rather a wolf than you any
day.

300
00:23:25,617 --> 00:23:28,669
This is hopeless.

301
00:23:30,493 --> 00:23:35,281
I’ll never get that red cape or find
a yellow slipper or a golden cow

302
00:23:35,417 --> 00:23:37,569
...or was it a golden
slipper and a yellow cow?

303
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:44,901
- What are you doing here?
- You forgot your scarf.

304
00:23:45,022 --> 00:23:46,922
You shouldn’t be here. It’s not safe
in these woods!

305
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:49,570
- I want to help.
- No! THE SPELL IS ON MY HOUSE...

306
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:52,361
OUR HOUSE... WE MUST LIFT THE SPELL TOGETHER!
THE SPELL IS ON... ONLY

307
00:23:52,362 --> 00:23:55,021
I CAN LIFT THE SPELL, THE SPELL IS
ON MY HOUSE...! THE SPELL IS ON...

308
00:23:56,158 --> 00:24:00,585
A cow as white as...
...milk.

309
00:24:01,361 --> 00:24:03,372
Go.

310
00:24:04,635 --> 00:24:06,355
Hello there, young lad.

311
00:24:06,483 --> 00:24:10,159
- Hello, sir.
- What might you be doing with a cow in the middle of the forest?

312
00:24:10,295 --> 00:24:12,241
I was heading toward market...

313
00:24:12,975 --> 00:24:16,043
- but I seem to have lost my way.
- What are you planning to do there?

314
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:19,447
- And what are you planning to do there?
- Sell my cow, sir.

315
00:24:19,607 --> 00:24:22,939
- No less than five pounds.
- Five pounds!

316
00:24:23,084 --> 00:24:24,729
Where are we to get five pounds?

317
00:24:24,865 --> 00:24:28,049
She must be generous of milk to fetch
five pounds?

318
00:24:28,201 --> 00:24:30,461
Yes, ma’am.

319
00:24:30,557 --> 00:24:33,703
And if you can’t fetch that sum? Then
what are you to do?

320
00:24:34,793 --> 00:24:36,297
I hadn’t thought of that...

321
00:24:36,425 --> 00:24:39,588
This is all we have...

322
00:24:39,725 --> 00:24:42,295
Beans? We mustn’t give up our beans!

323
00:24:42,423 --> 00:24:44,833
Well, if you feel we must...

324
00:24:44,949 --> 00:24:47,949
- Beans in exchange for my cow?
- Oh son, these are no ordinary beans.

325
00:24:48,085 --> 00:24:51,239
These beans carry... magic.

326
00:24:51,367 --> 00:24:53,387
Magic? What kind of magic?

327
00:24:54,781 --> 00:24:57,842
Tell him!

328
00:24:57,948 --> 00:25:01,663
It's a... it's a magic that
defies description.

329
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:03,478
How many beans?

330
00:25:03,479 --> 00:25:04,081
- Six.
- Five

331
00:25:04,208 --> 00:25:05,688
They’re worth a pound each, at least.

332
00:25:07,537 --> 00:25:09,939
- Could I buy my cow back someday?
- Well ...Yes...

333
00:25:10,055 --> 00:25:12,351
...possibly. Here.

334
00:25:12,472 --> 00:25:16,642
Yes, this things probably
made a fair trade.

335
00:25:17,953 --> 00:25:22,642
1 2 3 4 5

336
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:27,459
Allright bro.
Good luck in there,
Pleasure doing buisness with you.

337
00:25:30,734 --> 00:25:33,380
One day, I’ll buy you back.

338
00:25:33,517 --> 00:25:35,267
Promise!

339
00:25:40,944 --> 00:25:43,453
Take the cow and go home!

340
00:25:43,598 --> 00:25:46,281
- I was just trying to help.
- Magic beans!

341
00:25:47,016 --> 00:25:49,031
We’ve no reason to believe
they’re magic! Are

342
00:25:49,057 --> 00:25:51,115
we going to dispel this
curse through deceit?

343
00:25:51,202 --> 00:25:53,391
No one would have given him
more for this creature.

344
00:25:53,417 --> 00:25:55,690
We did him a favor. At least
they’ll have some food.

345
00:25:56,161 --> 00:25:58,098
- Five beans?!
- Do we want a child or not?

346
00:25:58,234 --> 00:26:00,103
Of course. I do. But... We have one chance.

347
00:26:00,239 --> 00:26:03,391
Don’t you see that? And if we fail...

348
00:26:03,519 --> 00:26:05,766
I’m just not sure I’m cut out to be a
father.

349
00:26:06,591 --> 00:26:09,621
- Why do you say that?
- Because of my father.

350
00:26:09,741 --> 00:26:11,817
- You’re not him.
- I don’t know...

351
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:16,400
If you can’t do this for yourself,

352
00:26:16,528 --> 00:26:19,652
can’t you at least do it for me?

353
00:26:23,117 --> 00:26:26,283
OK. You take the cow and go
home.

354
00:26:26,403 --> 00:26:28,835
I’ll find the rest of the
things. On my own.

355
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:15,036
Rapunzel. Rapunzel.

356
00:27:16,092 --> 00:27:18,425
Let down your hair to me.

357
00:27:18,553 --> 00:27:20,881
R’S PRINCE: Rapunzel...

358
00:27:22,319 --> 00:27:25,820
The old enchantress had given
the name Rapunzel to the child

359
00:27:25,846 --> 00:27:29,002
she had hidden away and
locked in a a doorless tower.

360
00:27:30,395 --> 00:27:33,558
But little did she know that
the girl’s lilting voice

361
00:27:33,584 --> 00:27:36,454
had caught the attention
of a handsome Prince.”

362
00:27:48,765 --> 00:27:50,806
Rapunzel...

363
00:28:11,498 --> 00:28:14,825
- Don’t you look lovely today, my dear.
- Thank you, Mother.

364
00:28:16,206 --> 00:28:19,193
I brought your favorite.

365
00:28:19,329 --> 00:28:20,931
Blackberries,

366
00:28:21,068 --> 00:28:22,705
fresh from the garden.

367
00:28:28,755 --> 00:28:31,806
As the little girl approached her
Granny’s oak tree,

368
00:28:31,935 --> 00:28:36,172
she was surprised
to see the door standing open.

369
00:28:37,128 --> 00:28:42,989
Oh dear, how uneasy I feel. Perhaps
it’s all the sweets.

370
00:29:02,758 --> 00:29:06,967
- Granny? WOLF (In a granny
voice): Come in, my deary.

371
00:29:21,162 --> 00:29:26,098
My, Grandmother. You’re looking very
strange.

372
00:29:26,226 --> 00:29:28,081
What big ears you have!

373
00:29:29,988 --> 00:29:35,483
The better to hear you with, my dear.

374
00:29:36,935 --> 00:29:41,689
And with a single bound, the wolf had
devoured the little girl.

375
00:29:42,482 --> 00:29:46,232
Well, it was a full day of eating for both.

376
00:30:08,837 --> 00:30:10,775
I can’t believe I just did that.

377
00:30:11,815 --> 00:30:12,993
Wait!

378
00:30:13,111 --> 00:30:15,728
Aren’t you going to help us skin that
beast?

379
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:18,825
- No thanks!
GRANNY: What kind of hunter are you?

380
00:30:18,969 --> 00:30:23,008
- I’m a baker.
Wait a minute. I never thanked you.

381
00:30:23,128 --> 00:30:25,569
- You need to be more careful, young lady.
- I’m sorry.

382
00:30:26,551 --> 00:30:29,025
I should have known better.
MOTHER SAID,

383
00:30:29,031 --> 00:30:30,648
”STRAIGHT AHEAD,” NOT
TO DELAY

384
00:30:30,786 --> 00:30:32,737
OR BE MISLED.

385
00:30:34,463 --> 00:30:36,648
I SHOULD HAVE HEEDED HER ADVICE...

386
00:30:36,776 --> 00:30:39,744
BUT HE SEEMED SO NICE.

387
00:30:41,236 --> 00:30:44,827
AND HE SHOWED ME THINGS, MANY
BEAUTIFUL THINGS,

388
00:30:44,964 --> 00:30:48,496
THAT I HADN’T
THOUGHT TO EXPLORE.

389
00:30:48,632 --> 00:30:52,301
THEY WERE OFF MY
PATH, SO I NEVER HAD DARED.

390
00:30:52,437 --> 00:30:56,431
I HAD BEEN SO CAREFUL
I NEVER HAD CARED.

391
00:30:56,576 --> 00:30:59,854
AND HE MADE ME FEEL EXCITED... WELL,
EXCITED AND SCARED.

392
00:31:02,413 --> 00:31:06,589
WHEN HE SAID “COME IN!”/
WITH THAT SICKENING GRIN,

393
00:31:06,615 --> 00:31:09,643
HOW COULD I KNOW
WHAT WAS IN STORE?

394
00:31:09,762 --> 00:31:13,653
ONCE HIS TEETH WERE
BARED, / THOUGH, I REALLY GOT SCARED... /

395
00:31:13,798 --> 00:31:15,934
WELL, EXCITED AND SCARED.

396
00:31:18,896 --> 00:31:22,502
BUT HE DREW ME CLOSE AND HE SWALLOWED
ME DOWN,

397
00:31:22,652 --> 00:31:27,202
DOWN A DARK, SLIMY PATH/
WHERE LIE SECRETS THAT I NEVER WANT TO
KNOW,

398
00:31:29,010 --> 00:31:32,310
AND WHEN EVERYTHING FAMILIAR SEEMED
TO DISAPPEAR FOREVER,

399
00:31:32,446 --> 00:31:36,951
AT THE END OF
THE PATH WAS GRANNY ONCE AGAIN.

400
00:31:39,650 --> 00:31:44,392
SO WE LAY IN THE DARK TILL YOU CAME
AND SET US FREE,

401
00:31:47,561 --> 00:31:49,852
AND YOU BROUGHT US TO THE LIGHT,
AND WE’RE

402
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:52,768
BACK AT THE START.

403
00:31:52,912 --> 00:31:56,785
AND I KNOW THINGS NOW, MANY VALUABLE
THINGS,

404
00:31:56,927 --> 00:32:00,165
THAT I HADN’T KNOWN BEFORE:

405
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:04,208
DO NOT PUT YOUR FAITH IN A CAPE AND A
HOOD,

406
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:07,866
THEY WILL NOT PROTECT YOU THE WAY
THAT THEY SHOULD.

407
00:32:08,018 --> 00:32:11,647
AND TAKE EXTRA CARE
WITH STRANGERS... EVEN FLOWERS HAVE
THEIR DANGERS.

408
00:32:11,789 --> 00:32:13,544
AND THOUGH SCARY IS
EXCITING,

409
00:32:13,696 --> 00:32:15,954
NICE IS DIFFERENT THAN
GOOD.

410
00:32:18,029 --> 00:32:20,238
Mr. Baker. You saved our lives.

411
00:32:21,229 --> 00:32:23,285
-Here.

412
00:32:24,151 --> 00:32:28,396
- Are you certain?
- Yes. Maybe Granny will make me another with the skins of the wolf.

413
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:29,995
Thank You

414
00:32:30,115 --> 00:32:33,255
- Thank You
- Yuck!

415
00:32:35,307 --> 00:32:39,224
NOW, I KNOW: DON’T BE SCARED. GRANNY
IS RIGHT, JUST BE PREPARED.

416
00:32:40,115 --> 00:32:42,678
ISN’T IT NICE TO KNOW A LOT?

417
00:32:44,081 --> 00:32:48,174
AND A LITTLE BIT NOT...

418
00:32:49,016 --> 00:32:51,106
How could you do this?

419
00:32:51,242 --> 00:32:53,844
What sort of
boy would exchange a cow for beans?

420
00:32:53,971 --> 00:32:55,754
But they’re magic... the man said...

421
00:32:55,873 --> 00:32:59,161
- Get your head out of the clouds!
- Mother... no!

422
00:32:59,914 --> 00:33:04,017
You and your worthless adventures!
Will you never learn, Jack?!

423
00:33:04,170 --> 00:33:07,545
To bed without supper for you!

424
00:33:09,461 --> 00:33:10,429
Pills!!

425
00:33:32,069 --> 00:33:36,157
The first night of the festival ball
brought Cinderella her wish.

426
00:33:36,294 --> 00:33:43,067
The Prince danced only with her, ‘til he
turned and she had slipped away.

427
00:34:12,158 --> 00:34:13,366
I must find that girl!

428
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:36,149
- Are you alright, miss?
- Yes

429
00:34:36,309 --> 00:34:39,624
- I just need to catch my breath.
- What a beautiful gown you’re wearing.

430
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,225
Were you at the King’s Festival?

431
00:34:41,361 --> 00:34:42,545
Yes.

432
00:34:42,681 --> 00:34:46,612
Aren’t you the lucky one.
Why ever are you in the woods at this hour?

433
00:34:46,755 --> 00:34:48,332
STEWARD: This way!

434
00:34:48,452 --> 00:34:50,967
Please. Don’t let them know I’m here.

435
00:34:56,557 --> 00:35:01,137
OMG! Have you seen a beautiful
young woman in a ball gown pass through?

436
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:06,683
- I don’t think so, sir.
- If I may, my lord, I think I see her over there.

437
00:35:11,819 --> 00:35:14,749
I’ve never lied to royalty before.

438
00:35:14,902 --> 00:35:17,536
- I’ve never anything to royalty before!
- Thank you.

439
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:21,155
If a prince were looking for me, I
certainly wouldn’t hide.

440
00:35:28,052 --> 00:35:31,663
Well, what brings you
here... and with a cow?

441
00:35:33,874 --> 00:35:38,970
- Oh, my husband’s somewhere in the woods.
He’s undoing a spell. - Oh!

442
00:35:43,896 --> 00:35:46,189
Oh, yes. But tell me, the Prince, what
was he like?

443
00:35:49,353 --> 00:35:51,225
HE’S A VERY NICE PRINCE.
- And?

444
00:35:51,501 --> 00:35:52,433
AND...

445
00:35:53,377 --> 00:35:55,863
IT’S A VERY NICE BALL.

446
00:35:55,888 --> 00:35:58,763
- And?
- AND... WHEN I ENTERED, THEY TRUMPETED.

447
00:35:59,164 --> 00:36:00,385
And? THE PRINCE...?

448
00:36:00,459 --> 00:36:01,780
OH, THE PRINCE...
YES, THE PRINCE!

449
00:36:01,865 --> 00:36:04,437
- WELL, HE’S TALL.
- IS THAT ALL?

450
00:36:04,565 --> 00:36:07,655
DID YOU DANCE? IS HE CHARMING?
THEY SAY THAT HE’S CHARMING.

451
00:36:07,784 --> 00:36:11,174
WE DID NOTHING BUT DANCE.
- Yes.

452
00:36:11,924 --> 00:36:14,242
- And?
- AND IT MADE A NICE CHANGE.

453
00:36:14,354 --> 00:36:16,274
NO, THE PRINCE!
OH, THE PRINCE...
YES, THE PRINCE.

454
00:36:16,318 --> 00:36:19,838
- HE HAS CHARM FOR A PRINCE, I GUESS...
- GUESS?

455
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:22,378
I DON’T MEET A WIDE RANGE.

456
00:36:23,862 --> 00:36:27,103
AND IT’S ALL VERY STRANGE.

457
00:36:27,173 --> 00:36:29,245
But why would you run away?

458
00:36:30,665 --> 00:36:35,720
- It’s not quite what I expected.
- Princes, castles, gowns...

459
00:36:35,864 --> 00:36:40,331
- I have no experience with those things.
- But you will return to the Festival tomorrow eve?

460
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:42,291
- Yes.
- No...

461
00:36:43,464 --> 00:36:45,699
I don’t know...
- You don’t know?

462
00:36:47,053 --> 00:36:50,231
What I wouldn’t give to be in your shoes.
I mean your slippers.

463
00:36:52,056 --> 00:36:53,857
- As pure as gold?
- I must get home.

464
00:36:53,992 --> 00:36:55,936
No, Wait! I need your shoes!

465
00:36:57,561 --> 00:36:59,447
Milky-White!

466
00:36:59,576 --> 00:37:02,276
One midnight gone!

467
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:04,904
- Already?!
- Get that cow!

468
00:37:48,259 --> 00:37:52,984
Mr. Baker! Mr. Baker!
Good fortune! Good fortune, sir!

469
00:37:53,151 --> 00:37:56,391
Look what I have! Five gold pieces.

470
00:37:56,519 --> 00:37:58,821
How would you come by five gold pieces?!

471
00:37:59,563 --> 00:38:03,285
THERE ARE GIANTS IN THE SKY!

472
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:08,416
THERE ARE BIG TALL
TERRIBLE GIANTS IN THE SKY!

473
00:38:12,961 --> 00:38:14,897
WHEN YOU’RE WAY UP HIGH
AND YOU LOOK BELOW AT THE

474
00:38:14,923 --> 00:38:16,900
WORLD YOU’VE LEFT AND
THE THINGS YOU KNOW,

475
00:38:17,010 --> 00:38:18,862
LITTLE MORE THAN A GLANCE IS ENOUGH
TO SHOW YOU JUST

476
00:38:19,021 --> 00:38:21,015
HOW SMALL YOU ARE.

477
00:38:22,592 --> 00:38:24,494
WHEN YOU’RE WAY UP HIGH AND
YOU’RE ON YOUR OWN IN A

478
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:26,600
WORLD LIKE NONE THAT YOU’VE
EVER KNOWN, WHERE THE SKY

479
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:32,180
IS LEAD AND THE EARTH IS STONE,
YOU’RE FREE TO DO WHATEVER PLEASES YOU,

480
00:38:32,315 --> 00:38:36,120
EXPLORING THINGS YOU’D NEVER DARE ’CAUSE
YOU DON’T CARE, WHEN SUDDENLY THERE’S A BIG

481
00:38:36,248 --> 00:38:41,335
TALL TERRIBLE GIANT AT THE DOOR.

482
00:38:41,463 --> 00:38:42,951
A giant?

483
00:38:43,669 --> 00:38:47,884
A BIG TALL TERRIBLE LADY GIANT

484
00:38:48,011 --> 00:38:50,052
SWEEPING THE FLOOR

485
00:38:50,926 --> 00:38:54,769
AND SHE GIVES YOU
FOOD AND SHE GIVES YOU REST

486
00:38:54,922 --> 00:38:58,564
AND SHE DRAWS YOU
CLOSE TO HER GIANT BREAST

487
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:03,489
AND YOU KNOW THINGS NOW THAT YOU NEVER
KNEW BEFORE

488
00:39:05,206 --> 00:39:07,490
NOT TILL THE SKY.

489
00:39:09,734 --> 00:39:11,499
ONLY JUST WHEN YOU’VE
MADE A FRIEND AND ALL,

490
00:39:11,525 --> 00:39:13,404
AND YOU KNOW SHE’S BIG
BUT YOU DON’T FEEL SMALL

491
00:39:13,524 --> 00:39:14,710
SOMEONE BIGGER THAN HER
COMES ALONG THE HALL

492
00:39:14,854 --> 00:39:17,210
TO
SWALLOW YOU FOR LUNCH.

493
00:39:18,983 --> 00:39:23,783
AND YOUR HEART IS LEAD AND YOUR STOMACH STONE
AND YOU’RE REALLY SCARED BEING ALL ALONE,

494
00:39:24,601 --> 00:39:26,937
AND IT’S THEN THAT YOU MISS ALL
THE THINGS YOU’VE KNOWN AND THE

495
00:39:26,963 --> 00:39:29,116
WORLD YOU’VE LEFT AND THE LITTLE YOU OWN.
THE FUN IS DONE.

496
00:39:29,244 --> 00:39:31,862
YOU STEAL WHAT YOU
CAN AND RUN!

497
00:39:31,982 --> 00:39:35,982
AND YOU SCRAMBLE DOWN AND YOU LOOK BELOW,
AND THE WORLD YOU KNOW BEGINS TO GROW:

498
00:39:36,008 --> 00:39:40,007
THE HOUSE,
AND YOUR MOTHER AT THE DOOR.

499
00:39:43,286 --> 00:39:49,289
THE ROOF, THE HOUSE, AND THE WORLD
YOU NEVER THOUGHT TO EXPLORE.

500
00:39:50,239 --> 00:39:53,814
AND YOU THINK OF ALL OF
THE THINGS YOU’VE SEEN.

501
00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:57,559
AND YOU WISH THAT YOU
COULD LIVE IN BETWEEN,

502
00:39:57,702 --> 00:40:03,110
AND YOU’RE BACK AGAIN,
ONLY DIFFERENT THAN BEFORE,

503
00:40:04,537 --> 00:40:07,078
AFTER THE SKY.

504
00:40:07,239 --> 00:40:11,465
THERE ARE GIANTS IN THE SKY!

505
00:40:11,619 --> 00:40:14,380
THERE ARE BIG TALL
TERRIBLE AWESOME SCARY

506
00:40:14,533 --> 00:40:20,728
WONDERFUL GIANTS IN THE SKY!

507
00:40:21,473 --> 00:40:23,886
So, here’s your money, sir!
Five gold pieces.

508
00:40:26,204 --> 00:40:27,629
Where is my Milky-White?

509
00:40:27,757 --> 00:40:31,099
Milky-White is back home with my wife.

510
00:40:31,211 --> 00:40:34,015
- Let’s go find them! -Wait a minute!
I’m not sure I want to sell.

511
00:40:34,143 --> 00:40:35,504
But you said I could buy her back.

512
00:40:35,566 --> 00:40:36,509
Do you want more money?

513
00:40:36,510 --> 00:40:38,185
- No, no, no! It’s not that...
- You keep that. I’ll fetch some more.

514
00:40:38,324 --> 00:40:40,724
Wait. I didn’t say...

515
00:40:40,875 --> 00:40:43,083
Wait!

516
00:40:43,809 --> 00:40:46,044
Wait! Wait!

517
00:40:46,172 --> 00:40:49,449
Wait! I said wait!

518
00:40:51,043 --> 00:40:53,985
- What are you doing here?
- Well...

519
00:40:55,231 --> 00:40:58,146
- I see you’ve got the red cape!
- Yes. I’ve got the cape. Only two items left.

520
00:40:58,147 --> 00:41:00,253
- Three.
- We’ve the cape and the cow.

521
00:41:00,373 --> 00:41:03,976
You’ve got the cape...
What have you done with the cow?!

522
00:41:05,287 --> 00:41:06,987
- She ran away.
- What!

523
00:41:07,099 --> 00:41:10,910
- I never reached home. I’ve been looking for her all night.
- How could you?

524
00:41:11,038 --> 00:41:13,446
She might just as easily have run from you!

525
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:15,089
- BUT SHE DIDN’T!!! -BUT SHE MIGHT HAVE!
- But she didn’t!

526
00:41:15,185 --> 00:41:17,744
- BUT SHE MIGHT HAVE!
- BUT SHE DIDN’T!!!

527
00:41:18,691 --> 00:41:21,488
WHO CARES! THE COW IS GONE! GET IT BACK!

528
00:41:21,639 --> 00:41:26,100
GET IT BACK!!!
We were just going to do that. Here.

529
00:41:26,227 --> 00:41:29,507
- In the meantime...
- STAY AWAY FROM ME WITH THAT, FOOL!!

530
00:41:30,811 --> 00:41:35,261
I can’t touch it!

531
00:41:35,382 --> 00:41:37,803
By midnight tomorrow
bring me the items

532
00:41:37,947 --> 00:41:42,429
or that child you wish for will
never see the light of day!

533
00:41:47,189 --> 00:41:50,117
I don’t like that woman.

534
00:41:52,791 --> 00:41:55,872
- I’m sorry I lost the cow.
- I shouldn’t have yelled.

535
00:41:59,627 --> 00:42:02,617
Will you go back to the village?
I will make things right.

536
00:42:02,756 --> 00:42:05,221
And then we can just go
about our life. No more witches

537
00:42:05,247 --> 00:42:07,866
or dimwitted boys
or hungry little girls.

538
00:42:08,758 --> 00:42:11,737
You GO!, please...

539
00:42:13,074 --> 00:42:15,410
Go.

540
00:42:33,922 --> 00:42:36,485
Good brother. I was wondering where
you’d gone.

541
00:42:36,637 --> 00:42:39,665
- I have been looking all night for her.
- Her?

542
00:42:39,794 --> 00:42:43,387
- The beautiful one I danced the evening with.
- Where did she go?

543
00:42:44,072 --> 00:42:45,691
Disappeared...

544
00:42:45,811 --> 00:42:49,000
...like the fine morning mist.
- She was lovely?

545
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:52,414
The loveliest. I am not certain of that!

546
00:42:53,082 --> 00:42:55,720
I must confess, I too have found a lovely maiden.
She lives here in the woods.

547
00:42:55,835 --> 00:42:59,065
- She lives here in the woods.
- In the woods?

548
00:42:59,066 --> 00:43:00,117
Yes.

549
00:43:00,245 --> 00:43:02,694
In the top of a tall tower
that has no door or stairs.

550
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:06,403
- Where? -Two leagues from here, due
east, just beyond the mossy knoll

551
00:43:06,523 --> 00:43:09,304
near the rose thickets.
And how do you manage a visit?

552
00:43:09,432 --> 00:43:12,899
I stand beneath her tower and say,
“Rapunzel,

553
00:43:13,042 --> 00:43:16,701
Rapunzel, let down your hair to me.”
And then she lowers the longest,

554
00:43:16,727 --> 00:43:20,123
most beautiful head of hair -
yellow as corn - which I climb.

555
00:43:21,723 --> 00:43:23,602
Rapunzel, Rapunzel!

556
00:43:23,603 --> 00:43:26,555
What kind of name is that?
You jest!

557
00:43:26,668 --> 00:43:28,199
I have never heard
of such a thing.

558
00:43:28,827 --> 00:43:32,023
I speak the truth! She is
as true as your maiden. A maiden

559
00:43:32,049 --> 00:43:35,429
running from a prince?
None would run from us.

560
00:43:39,149 --> 00:43:42,835
Yet one has.

561
00:43:48,252 --> 00:43:51,896
DID I ABUSE HER OR
SHOW HER DISDAIN?

562
00:43:52,048 --> 00:43:54,872
WHY DOES SHE RUN FROM ME?

563
00:43:55,808 --> 00:44:02,778
IF I SHOULD LOSE HER, HOW SHALL I
REGAIN THE HEART SHE HAS WON FROM ME?

564
00:44:02,946 --> 00:44:08,310
AGONY...! BEYOND POWER OF SPEECH.

565
00:44:09,086 --> 00:44:16,938
WHEN THE ONE THING YOU WANT IS
THE ONLY THING OUT OF YOUR REACH.

566
00:44:17,098 --> 00:44:23,439
HIGH IN HER TOWER, SHE SITS BY
THE HOUR, MAINTAINING HER HAIR.

567
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:32,080
BLITHE AND BECOMING, AND FREQUENTLY HUMMING
A LIGHTHEARTED AIR: “AH-AH-AH-AH-AHAHAH... ”

568
00:44:33,361 --> 00:44:38,880
AGONY...! FAR MORE
PAINFUL THAN YOURS,

569
00:44:39,024 --> 00:44:46,386
WHEN YOU KNOW SHE WOULD GO WITH
YOU, IF THERE ONLY WERE DOORS.

570
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:51,984
AGONY! OH THE TORTURE THEY TEACH!

571
00:44:53,592 --> 00:44:59,578
WHAT’S AS INTRIGUING... OR HALF SO
FATIGUING... AS WHAT’S OUT OF REACH?

572
00:44:59,770 --> 00:45:04,831
AM I NOT SENSITIVE, CLEVER,
WELLMANNERED, CONSIDERATE, PASSIONATE,

573
00:45:04,857 --> 00:45:09,330
CHARMING, AS KIND AS I’M
HANDSOME, AND HEIR TO A THRONE?

574
00:45:09,495 --> 00:45:12,807
YOU ARE EVERYTHING
MAIDENS COULD WISH FOR!

575
00:45:12,940 --> 00:45:14,596
- THEN WHY NO...?
- DO I KNOW?

576
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:17,502
THE GIRL MUST BE MAD.

577
00:45:17,631 --> 00:45:20,750
YOU KNOW NOTHING OF MADNESS

578
00:45:20,870 --> 00:45:26,315
TILL YOU’RE CLIMBING HER HAIR AND YOU
SEE HER UP THERE AS YOU’RE NEARING HER,

579
00:45:26,323 --> 00:45:34,236
ALL THE WHILE HEARING HER,
“AH-AH-AHAH-AH-AH-AH-AH-AH-AH... ”

580
00:45:35,387 --> 00:45:41,673
AGONY! MISERY! WOE! THOUGH IT’S
DIFFERENT FOR EACH. ALWAYS

581
00:45:41,689 --> 00:45:43,508
TEN STEPS BEHIND... ALWAYS

582
00:45:43,636 --> 00:45:45,473
TEN FEET BELOW... AND SHE’S

583
00:45:45,594 --> 00:45:48,348
JUST OUT OF REACH

584
00:45:48,384 --> 00:45:50,623
AGONY!

585
00:45:50,673 --> 00:45:54,156
THAT CAN CUT LIKE A KNIFE!

586
00:45:55,690 --> 00:46:03,690
I MUST HAVE HER TO WIFE.

587
00:46:45,006 --> 00:46:51,007
Rapunzel, Rapunzel? Let
your hair down to me.

588
00:46:55,710 --> 00:46:58,083
Is that you at this hour, my Prince?

589
00:47:00,342 --> 00:47:02,369
Yes.

590
00:47:30,614 --> 00:47:33,511
Excuse me for this.

591
00:47:44,270 --> 00:47:46,621
As the Baker’s Wife
bolted from the tower,

592
00:47:46,766 --> 00:47:49,687
the second night of the
festival was thrown into chaos

593
00:47:49,807 --> 00:47:53,177
when Cinderella once again
ran from the Prince.

594
00:48:08,883 --> 00:48:11,371
- What are you doing?
- So sorry I need your shoes.

595
00:48:15,983 --> 00:48:17,120
Over here!

596
00:48:23,698 --> 00:48:26,739
- Who is she? Where did she go?
- I have no idea, sir.

597
00:48:26,865 --> 00:48:30,723
- Don’t play the fool, woman!
- I was trying to hold her here for you...

598
00:48:30,843 --> 00:48:33,006
I can capture my own damsel, thank you.

599
00:48:33,147 --> 00:48:37,214
No sign of her, my liege. Well, what are you waiting for?
See if you can find her. -Go!

600
00:48:40,750 --> 00:48:44,173
The woods can be a dangerous place...

601
00:48:52,990 --> 00:48:57,248
Moo... Moo......

602
00:49:07,992 --> 00:49:12,883
Please, if you would be so kind, may I
compare this ear of corn with your hair?

603
00:49:15,639 --> 00:49:18,251
Mongrel!

604
00:49:32,833 --> 00:49:35,992
Milky-White!

605
00:49:45,217 --> 00:49:47,903
- I thought you were returning home!
- Oh! It’s you! And you’ve the cow!

606
00:49:47,904 --> 00:49:50,617
Yes. I got the cow. We’ve two of the four.
- Three -Two -Three

607
00:49:51,885 --> 00:49:55,583
Compare this to your corn.

608
00:49:55,702 --> 00:49:58,335
- Where did you find it?
- I pulled it from a maiden in a tower.

609
00:49:58,965 --> 00:50:00,282
- Three!
- And Had I

610
00:50:00,334 --> 00:50:01,614
almost go the fourth, but she got away.

611
00:50:01,719 --> 00:50:05,011
We’ve one entire day left. Surely
we can locate the slipper by then. -We?

612
00:50:06,050 --> 00:50:08,585
You mean you’re going to let me
stay with you?

613
00:50:11,431 --> 00:50:15,854
Well... perhaps it will take the two of
us to have this child.

614
00:50:17,009 --> 00:50:22,579
YOU’VE CHANGED. YOU’RE DARING.
YOU’RE DIFFERENT IN THE WOODS.

615
00:50:24,072 --> 00:50:29,484
MORE SURE, MORE SHARING. YOU’RE
GETTING US THROUGH THE WOODS.

616
00:50:30,449 --> 00:50:38,449
IF YOU COULD SEE... YOU’RE NOT THE MAN
WHO STARTED, AND MUCH MORE

617
00:50:38,636 --> 00:50:41,839
OPENHEARTED THEN I
KNEW YOU TO BE.

618
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:46,150
IT TAKES TWO. I THOUGHT ONE

619
00:50:46,287 --> 00:50:48,094
WAS ENOUGH, IT’S NOT TRUE:

620
00:50:48,244 --> 00:50:51,385
IT TAKES TWO OF US
YOU CAME THROUGH

621
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:54,266
WHEN THE JOURNEY WAS
ROUGH... IT TOOK YOU

622
00:50:54,409 --> 00:50:57,772
IT TOOK TWO OF US.
IT TAKES CARE,

623
00:50:57,925 --> 00:51:01,008
IT TAKES PATIENCE AND FEAR
AND DESPAIR

624
00:51:01,152 --> 00:51:06,882
TO CHANGE THOUGH YOU SWEAR TO CHANGE,
WHO CAN TELL IF YOU DO?

625
00:51:07,979 --> 00:51:10,333
IT TAKES TWO.
YOU’VE CHANGED.

626
00:51:10,461 --> 00:51:14,494
YOU’RE THRIVING.
THERE’S SOMETHING ABOUT THE WOODS.

627
00:51:14,646 --> 00:51:20,728
NOT JUST SURVIVING, YOU’RE
BLOSSOMING IN THE WOODS.

628
00:51:20,864 --> 00:51:27,440
AT HOME I’D FEAR WE’D
STAY THE SAME FOREVER.

629
00:51:27,574 --> 00:51:30,766
AND THEN OUT HERE

630
00:51:30,902 --> 00:51:35,440
YOU’RE PASSIONATE, CHARMING,
CONSIDERATE, CLEVER... IT TAKES ONE

631
00:51:35,591 --> 00:51:38,342
TO BEGIN, BUT THEN ONCE
YOU’VE BEGUN,

632
00:51:38,472 --> 00:51:41,476
IT TAKES TWO OF YOU. IT’S NO FUN,

633
00:51:41,604 --> 00:51:44,739
BUT WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE YOU
CAN DO

634
00:51:44,875 --> 00:51:46,984
WHEN THERE’S TWO OF YOU.
IF I DARE,

635
00:51:48,131 --> 00:51:52,548
IT’S BECAUSE I’M BECOMING
AWARE OF US

636
00:51:52,692 --> 00:51:57,263
AS A PAIR OF US EACH ACCEPTING
A SHARE OF WHAT’S THERE.

637
00:51:58,139 --> 00:52:02,188
WE’VE CHANGED. WE’RE STRANGERS.

638
00:52:02,340 --> 00:52:08,447
I’M MEETING YOU IN THE WOODS.
WHO MINDS WHAT DANGERS?

639
00:52:08,584 --> 00:52:11,310
I KNOW WE’LL GET PAST THE WOODS.

640
00:52:11,454 --> 00:52:17,620
AND ONCE WE’RE PAST, LET’S HOPE THE
CHANGES LAST

641
00:52:17,748 --> 00:52:22,314
BEYOND WOODS, BEYOND
WITCHES AND SLIPPERS AND HOODS

642
00:52:22,450 --> 00:52:25,198
JUST THE TWO OF US BEYOND LIES,

643
00:52:25,342 --> 00:52:28,416
SAFE AT HOME
WITH OUR BEAUTIFUL PRIZE,

644
00:52:28,552 --> 00:52:31,902
JUST THE FEW OF US.
IT TAKES TRUST.

645
00:52:32,021 --> 00:52:34,746
IT TAKES JUST A BIT
MORE AND WE’RE DONE

646
00:52:34,890 --> 00:52:37,922
WE WANT FOUR, WE HAD NONE. WE’VE GOT THREE.

647
00:52:38,050 --> 00:52:41,006
WE NEED ONE. IT TAKES TWO.

648
00:52:44,661 --> 00:52:46,629
Stop it! Stop my egg!

649
00:52:49,797 --> 00:52:51,723
Oh, brilliant! My Milky-White.

650
00:52:51,857 --> 00:52:53,763
- I missed you so much!
- Where did you get this?

651
00:52:53,893 --> 00:52:58,118
From the Giant’s hen! -A golden egg!
I’ve never seen a golden egg before.

652
00:52:58,254 --> 00:53:00,134
And you can have it. Along
with the five gold pieces.

653
00:53:00,270 --> 00:53:02,446
- Five gold pieces?
- Now I’m taking my cow.

654
00:53:02,583 --> 00:53:05,451
- O..no, I didn't wish to sell.
- But you took the five gold pieces.

655
00:53:05,602 --> 00:53:08,268
- I didn’t take, you gave.
- You said I could have my cow!

656
00:53:08,389 --> 00:53:10,149
Now I never said you could. I
said you might.

657
00:53:10,262 --> 00:53:12,618
You would take money before a child?!
No, no, no - it’s not like that!

658
00:53:12,757 --> 00:53:14,347
It’s not how it sounds!

659
00:53:17,028 --> 00:53:19,410
Milky-White...!

660
00:53:23,981 --> 00:53:27,376
Milky-White is dead!

661
00:53:28,201 --> 00:53:32,844
TWO MIDNIGHTS GONE!

662
00:53:42,036 --> 00:53:47,489
When dawn broke, the Baker and his Wife had but
one day left to reverse the Witch’s curse.

663
00:53:48,340 --> 00:53:50,367
As for Rapunzel’s Prince, he returned

664
00:53:50,494 --> 00:53:53,418
yet again to the
forbidden tower.

665
00:54:00,769 --> 00:54:04,114
Bad idea!

666
00:54:04,115 --> 00:54:04,796
Are you allright?

667
00:54:06,787 --> 00:54:08,851
Yah, Yah, me allright.

668
00:54:41,739 --> 00:54:45,135
WHAT DID I CLEARLY SAY? CHILDREN MUST LISTEN.
No, no, please!

669
00:54:45,257 --> 00:54:49,766
WHAT WERE YOU NOT TO DO?
CHILDREN MUST SEE... -No!

670
00:54:49,886 --> 00:54:52,568
AND LEARN.

671
00:54:52,697 --> 00:54:55,140
WHY COULD YOU NOT OBEY?

672
00:54:55,696 --> 00:54:57,307
CHILDREN SHOULD LISTEN.

673
00:54:58,083 --> 00:55:05,576
WHAT HAVE I BEEN TO YOU? WHAT WOULD YOU
HAVE ME BE, HANDSOME LIKE A PRINCE?

674
00:55:07,586 --> 00:55:12,857
AH, BUT I AM OLD. I AM UGLY.
I EMBARRASS YOU. -No!

675
00:55:12,858 --> 00:55:15,078
YOU ARE ASHAMED OF ME.
- No!

676
00:55:15,188 --> 00:55:18,673
YOU ARE ASHAMED.

677
00:55:20,374 --> 00:55:28,328
YOU DON’T
UNDERSTAND.

678
00:55:30,482 --> 00:55:34,461
I’m no longer a child. I
wish to see the world.

679
00:55:39,085 --> 00:55:46,031
DON’T YOU KNOW WHAT’S
OUT THERE IN THE WORLD?

680
00:55:46,199 --> 00:55:52,342
SOMEONE HAS TO SHIELD YOU FROM
THE WORLD

681
00:55:52,455 --> 00:55:53,339
STAY WITH ME.

682
00:56:00,906 --> 00:56:06,490
PRINCES WAIT THERE IN THE WORLD, IT’S
TRUE.

683
00:56:07,619 --> 00:56:12,754
PRINCES, YES, BUT
WOLVES AND HUMANS, TOO.

684
00:56:13,530 --> 00:56:16,778
STAY AT HOME.

685
00:56:16,922 --> 00:56:17,602
I AM HOME.

686
00:56:23,930 --> 00:56:30,587
WHO OUT THERE COULD LOVE YOU MORE THAN I?
WHAT OUT THERE

687
00:56:30,728 --> 00:56:35,346
THAT I
CANNOT SUPPLY?

688
00:56:35,466 --> 00:56:41,010
STAY WITH ME.

689
00:56:41,718 --> 00:56:49,718
STAY WITH ME, THE WORLD IS DARK AND
WILD

690
00:56:53,352 --> 00:57:01,352
STAY A CHILD WHILE YOU CAN BE A
CHILD.

691
00:57:05,068 --> 00:57:05,612
WITH ME.

692
00:57:17,766 --> 00:57:22,708
I gave you protection and
yet you disobeyed me.

693
00:57:22,853 --> 00:57:24,276
No!

694
00:57:24,352 --> 00:57:27,673
Your prince will never lay eyes on you
again.

695
00:57:28,317 --> 00:57:30,640
He will never lay eyes
on anything again!

696
00:57:30,776 --> 00:57:33,064
What did you do to him?

697
00:57:33,184 --> 00:57:34,568
It doesn’t matter...

698
00:57:34,688 --> 00:57:40,017
because where you’re
going, no one will ever see you again.

699
00:57:40,137 --> 00:57:42,296
No, No!

700
00:57:43,706 --> 00:57:44,776
No!

701
00:57:58,816 --> 00:58:02,216
- Hey there, nice cape! -Stay away from my
cape or I’ll slash you into a thousand bits!

702
00:58:02,857 --> 00:58:05,274
Whoa! I don’t want it.

703
00:58:05,411 --> 00:58:08,146
-Where did you get it?
-My Granny made it for me from a wolf
that attacked us.

704
00:58:08,278 --> 00:58:12,452
And she gave me this beautiful knife for protection.
- Well, look what I have! A golden egg.

705
00:58:14,695 --> 00:58:16,671
Where did you get that egg?
- I stole a hen that

706
00:58:16,697 --> 00:58:18,672
lays golden eggs from the
kingdom of the Giant.

707
00:58:19,884 --> 00:58:21,727
I don’t believe you.

708
00:58:21,855 --> 00:58:24,158
It’s true. And you should see
the Giant’s toy harp. It plays

709
00:58:24,184 --> 00:58:26,624
the most beautiful tunes without
your even having to touch it.

710
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:28,918
Of course it does. Why
don’t you go up to the

711
00:58:28,944 --> 00:58:31,285
kingdom right now and bring
it back and show it?

712
00:58:31,380 --> 00:58:32,652
I could.

713
00:58:32,771 --> 00:58:35,521
- You could not! -I could!
- You could not, Mr. Liar!

714
00:58:35,632 --> 00:58:37,849
I am not a liar! I’ll get that harp.
You’ll see!

715
00:58:39,778 --> 00:58:46,234
Jack took the little girl’s dare and before he
knew it, found himself fleeing from a Giant.

716
00:59:08,522 --> 00:59:11,120
We’ve only one day left! I
don’t know where to start.

717
00:59:11,264 --> 00:59:13,049
You can start by buying a
new cow with the money you

718
00:59:13,075 --> 00:59:14,725
took from the boy. -Right,
where do I buy a cow?

719
00:59:14,820 --> 00:59:18,115
You go to the next village,
you’ll find a cow there.

720
00:59:18,266 --> 00:59:20,166
What are you going to do?
- I’m going to get the slipper.

721
00:59:20,302 --> 00:59:21,953
- The yellow slipper?
- The GOLDEN slipper!

722
00:59:22,073 --> 00:59:24,953
Yes. The golden slipper, that’s what I
meant. How are you gon'na find it?

723
00:59:25,484 --> 00:59:28,657
I have met a maiden with golden
slippers these two previous nights.

724
00:59:28,768 --> 00:59:31,768
- You think you could get one? -Yes, I’m sure of it.
I’ll meet you back here.

725
00:59:34,066 --> 00:59:37,491
Right.
Why are we always separating?

726
00:59:37,626 --> 00:59:40,274
Because we have to if we’re going to
be together...

727
00:59:51,490 --> 00:59:53,122
What is happening?

728
00:59:54,477 --> 00:59:58,639
ÇáããáßÉ ÈßÇãáåÇ
ÕÚÞÊ ÚäÏãÇ ÃäåÇÑÊ ÇáÔÌÑÉ ÇáÚãáÇÞÉ

729
00:59:58,767 --> 01:00:02,087
The entire kingdom shook when the beanstalk
came crashing down, killing the Giant...

730
01:00:02,463 --> 01:00:08,741
...as for Cinderella, she fled from
the Prince... again.

731
01:00:38,993 --> 01:00:41,912
HE’S A VERY SMART PRINCE

732
01:00:43,010 --> 01:00:46,256
HE’S A PRINCE WHO PREPARES.

733
01:00:46,934 --> 01:00:49,797
KNOWING THIS TIME
I’D RUN FROM HIM,

734
01:00:50,827 --> 01:00:53,262
HE SPREAD
PITCH ON THE STAIRS.

735
01:00:53,390 --> 01:00:57,663
AND I’M CAUGHT UNAWARES.

736
01:00:57,782 --> 01:00:59,871
WELL, IT MEANS THAT HE CARES...

737
01:01:00,959 --> 01:01:04,796
THIS IS MORE THAN JUST MALICE.

738
01:01:04,822 --> 01:01:08,984
BETTER STOP AND TAKE STOCK WHILE YOU’RE STANDING
HERE STUCK/ ON THE STEPS OF THE PALACE.

739
01:01:10,673 --> 01:01:15,072
ALL RIGHT, WHAT DO YOU WANT?
HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION.

740
01:01:15,988 --> 01:01:20,504
WHY NOT STAY AND BE CAUGHT? SHOULD I GIVE
THAT A THOUGHT, WHAT WOULD BE HIS RESPONSE?

741
01:01:20,632 --> 01:01:26,618
BUT THEN WHAT IF HE KNEW WHO I AM WHEN I KNOW
THAT I’M NOT WHAT HE THINKS THAT HE WANTS?

742
01:01:27,286 --> 01:01:33,049
OR THEN WHAT IF I AM WHAT
A PRINCE WOULD ENVISION?

743
01:01:33,050 --> 01:01:35,969
BUT THEN HOW CAN YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE TILL
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU WANT, WHICH I DON’T?

744
01:01:36,010 --> 01:01:38,376
SO THEN WHICH DO YOU PICK:
WHERE YOU’RE SAFE, OUT OF

745
01:01:38,402 --> 01:01:40,679
SIGHT, AND YOURSELF, BUT
WHERE EVERYTHING’S WRONG?

746
01:01:42,694 --> 01:01:46,585
OR WHERE EVERYTHING’S RIGHT BUT YOU
KNOW THAT YOU’LL NEVER BELONG?

747
01:01:47,715 --> 01:01:50,361
AND WHICHEVER YOU PICK, DO
IT QUICK, ‘CAUSE YOU’RE

748
01:01:50,387 --> 01:01:52,772
STARTING TO STICK TO THE
STEPS OF THE PALACE.

749
01:01:53,966 --> 01:01:58,940
IT’S MY FIRST BIG DECISION, THE
CHOICE ISN’T EASY TO MAKE.

750
01:01:59,072 --> 01:02:03,944
TO ARRIVE AT A BALL IS EXCITING AND ALL...
ONCE YOU’RE THERE, THOUGH, IT’S SCARY.

751
01:02:04,072 --> 01:02:08,585
AND IT’S FUN TO DECEIVE WHEN YOU KNOW
YOU CAN LEAVE, BUT YOU HAVE TO BE WARY.

752
01:02:08,746 --> 01:02:11,695
THERE’S A LOT THAT’S AT STAKE,
BUT I’VE STALLED LONG ENOUGH

753
01:02:11,721 --> 01:02:14,669
‘CAUSE I’M STILL STANDING STUCK
IN THE STUFF ON THESE STEPS

754
01:02:14,756 --> 01:02:22,172
...BETTER RUN ALONG HOME AND AVOID THE COLLISION THOUGH
AT HOME THEY DON’T CARE, I’LL BE BETTER OFF THERE

755
01:02:22,300 --> 01:02:25,311
WHERE
THERE’S NOTHING TO CHOOSE, SO THERE’S
NOTHING TO LOSE.

756
01:02:25,996 --> 01:02:30,650
SO I’LL PRY UP MY SHOES.

757
01:02:30,786 --> 01:02:35,584
WAIT, THOUGH, THINKING IT THROUGH,
THINGS DON’T HAVE TO COLLIDE...

758
01:02:35,719 --> 01:02:39,196
I KNOW WHAT MY DECISION IS:
WHICH IS NOT TO DECIDE.

759
01:02:39,356 --> 01:02:46,103
I’LL JUST LEAVE HIM A CLUE:
FOR EXAMPLE, A SHOE.

760
01:02:46,247 --> 01:02:52,334
AND THEN SEE WHAT HE’LL DO. NOW IT’S HE
AND NOT YOU WHO’LL BE STUCK WITH A SHOE

761
01:02:52,462 --> 01:02:57,229
IN A STEW, IN THE
GOO, AND I’VE LEARNED SOMETHING

762
01:02:57,357 --> 01:03:02,902
TOO, SOMETHING I NEVER KNEW,

763
01:03:03,560 --> 01:03:09,656
ON THE STEPS OF THE PALACE!

764
01:03:23,932 --> 01:03:26,222
The ball is over.
Send everyone home.

765
01:03:26,890 --> 01:03:31,514
- And the Princess?
- She won’t get far with one shoe.

766
01:03:47,656 --> 01:03:51,314
- Don’t come any closer to me.
- Please, stop! Just hear me out!

767
01:03:51,442 --> 01:03:53,734
- You have attacked me once before.
- I didn’t attack you.

768
01:03:53,863 --> 01:03:55,929
I attacked your shoe. I need it. I

769
01:03:56,604 --> 01:03:59,344
have a magic bean
in exchange for it.

770
01:04:00,343 --> 01:04:01,678
Magic bean?

771
01:04:04,137 --> 01:04:08,283
- Nonsense!
- Wait, please. I haven’t much time!

772
01:04:08,443 --> 01:04:11,617
I need that shoe
to have a child.

773
01:04:12,309 --> 01:04:16,034
- That makes no sense! -Does it make sense
that you’re running from a prince?

774
01:04:16,178 --> 01:04:19,233
I must go!
Take my shoes. You’ll run faster.

775
01:04:20,255 --> 01:04:22,600
ÎÐí ÔßÑÇ áß

776
01:04:24,342 --> 01:04:26,452
Stop! What is that you
have in your hand?

777
01:04:26,589 --> 01:04:29,450
- It’s mine. -Lying will
cost you your life!

778
01:04:29,451 --> 01:04:31,662
I don’t care if this
costs me my life... Get away!

779
01:04:31,782 --> 01:04:33,994
You will pay for this!

780
01:04:36,296 --> 01:04:39,882
Sire! I have succeeded in
obtaining the other slipper.

781
01:04:40,025 --> 01:04:43,650
Please give me the slipper, kind Prince,
and all will come to a happy end.

782
01:04:43,770 --> 01:04:45,172
Step back, peon!

783
01:04:45,283 --> 01:04:48,293
Do as she says, Steward.
We only need one.

784
01:04:51,011 --> 01:04:55,418
We must search immediately for the
maiden who fits this slipper.

785
01:04:55,546 --> 01:04:58,268
- Tonight?
- This very night!

786
01:05:08,593 --> 01:05:15,428
And in her haste, the Baker’s Wife took no
notice of a second beanstalk climbing skyward.

787
01:05:16,122 --> 01:05:18,955
Let it be known that his Royal
Highness the Crown Prince

788
01:05:18,981 --> 01:05:21,664
will be visiting every house
in this village tonight.

789
01:05:21,757 --> 01:05:24,842
All young maidens are hereby
commanded to remain in

790
01:05:24,868 --> 01:05:28,071
their home until they are
visited by the Royal Guard.

791
01:05:41,207 --> 01:05:46,218
All young maidens are hereby...

792
01:05:50,947 --> 01:05:53,670
As the Prince anxiously
waited, the Stepmother took

793
01:05:53,696 --> 01:05:56,523
matters... and Florinda’s
foot... into her own hands.

794
01:05:56,659 --> 01:05:59,943
CAREFUL, MY TOE...!
DARLING, I KNOW...

795
01:06:00,463 --> 01:06:03,710
IT’LL HAVE TO GO. BUT WHEN
YOU’RE HIS BRIDE, YOU

796
01:06:03,736 --> 01:06:06,784
CAN SIT OR RIDE. YOU’LL
NEVER NEED TO WALK!

797
01:06:11,016 --> 01:06:12,609
Aaaaaaaaa!

798
01:06:14,906 --> 01:06:18,410
Minus one toe, Florinda
mounted the Prince’s horse,

799
01:06:18,436 --> 01:06:21,669
unaware of the blood
dripping from the slipper.

800
01:06:33,097 --> 01:06:34,990
Lucinda was next.

801
01:06:37,045 --> 01:06:40,427
WHY WON’T IT FIT? DARLING, BE STILL. CUT
OFF A BIT OF THE HEEL AND IT WILL. AND

802
01:06:40,453 --> 01:06:43,750
WHEN YOU’RE HIS WIFE YOU’LL HAVE SUCH
A LIFE,

803
01:06:43,845 --> 01:06:45,929
YOU’LL NEVER NEED TO WALK!

804
01:06:49,860 --> 01:06:51,949
Aaaaaa...!

805
01:06:53,381 --> 01:06:57,905
Minus a heel, Lucinda did her
best to swallow the pain.

806
01:07:07,441 --> 01:07:10,234
It’s a perfect fit, Your Highness!

807
01:07:14,417 --> 01:07:18,450
Have you no other daughters? Only a
little stunted kitchen wench, which her

808
01:07:18,476 --> 01:07:23,401
late father left behind but she cannot
present herself. She is too dirty.

809
01:07:58,355 --> 01:08:02,255
I would recognize these beautiful eyes anywhere.
This is the true bride!

810
01:08:06,221 --> 01:08:10,087
You are my true bride!

811
01:08:22,665 --> 01:08:25,423
As punishment for their
cruelty, Cinderella’s birds

812
01:08:25,449 --> 01:08:28,365
swooped down upon the Stepsisters...

813
01:08:29,498 --> 01:08:32,144
and blinded them.

814
01:08:34,464 --> 01:08:38,952

815
01:08:39,088 --> 01:08:41,335
As for Rapunzel, the Witch had banished her to
a swamp in the darkest depths of the forest.

816
01:08:41,360 --> 01:08:46,360
Subtitled by-Mamun Mehedee

817
01:08:57,232 --> 01:08:59,206
Rapunzel?

818
01:08:59,859 --> 01:09:03,496
Rapunzel?

819
01:09:04,495 --> 01:09:06,764
Rapunzel?

820
01:09:06,884 --> 01:09:11,091
My darling!
I'm here.

821
01:09:11,092 --> 01:09:12,833
Rapunzel?

822
01:09:13,889 --> 01:09:15,312
Rapunzel?

823
01:09:23,010 --> 01:09:25,648
Rapunzel? Is it you?
I'm blind, I can't see.

824
01:09:33,942 --> 01:09:37,254
How could she do this to you?

825
01:09:48,466 --> 01:09:51,078
- Rapunzel!
- What?

826
01:09:52,563 --> 01:09:55,054
I can see you!

827
01:09:57,109 --> 01:09:58,774
You are here.

828
01:10:14,753 --> 01:10:15,798
Come on!

829
01:10:17,622 --> 01:10:21,166
We don’t have any time...

830
01:10:21,278 --> 01:10:22,534
Come on!

831
01:10:22,654 --> 01:10:24,868
I’ve found you!
You’ve got the cow!

832
01:10:24,996 --> 01:10:28,034
You’ve got the slipper!
We’ve all four!

833
01:10:32,810 --> 01:10:36,039
I see a cow. I see a slipper.

834
01:10:36,040 --> 01:10:39,465
And the cape as red as blood.

835
01:10:39,605 --> 01:10:41,485
And the hair as yellow as corn.
We got all full.

836
01:10:43,137 --> 01:10:46,501
Wait a minute! That cow doesn’t
look as white as milk to me

837
01:10:47,813 --> 01:10:49,492
Of course she is.

838
01:10:49,620 --> 01:10:52,124
She has to be!

839
01:10:52,885 --> 01:10:55,260
This cow has been covered with flour!

840
01:10:55,396 --> 01:10:57,045
What? You didn’t get a real white cow.

841
01:10:57,178 --> 01:11:00,172
We had a cow as white as milk.
Honestly we did.

842
01:11:00,300 --> 01:11:02,031
- Then where is she?
- She’s dead.

843
01:11:02,166 --> 01:11:04,092
And we thought you’d
prefer a live cow.

844
01:11:04,212 --> 01:11:07,732
Of course I’d prefer a live cow! So show me
the dead cow and I’ll bring her back to life!

845
01:11:10,869 --> 01:11:13,264
OK. This way, this way.

846
01:11:13,393 --> 01:11:14,552
Jack!

847
01:11:14,688 --> 01:11:15,840
Jack!

848
01:11:17,268 --> 01:11:18,857
Jack!

849
01:11:18,977 --> 01:11:21,497
There you are! I’ve been
worried sick about you!

850
01:11:21,631 --> 01:11:24,118
There’s a dead giant in our backyard!

851
01:11:24,256 --> 01:11:26,568
-There is? -You know there is.

852
01:11:26,712 --> 01:11:30,134
You could have been crushed!
- But Mother, look.

853
01:11:30,276 --> 01:11:31,810
The most beautiful harp.

854
01:11:33,774 --> 01:11:36,570
You’ve stolen too much.

855
01:11:36,699 --> 01:11:38,956
You could have been killed coming down
that plant

856
01:11:39,090 --> 01:11:42,464
We’re running out of time!
It’s here...

857
01:11:43,100 --> 01:11:45,529
- What’s happening?- -She’s going
to bring Milky-White back to life.

858
01:11:45,657 --> 01:11:47,777
- She can do that?
- She’s a witch! She can do anything!

859
01:11:48,678 --> 01:11:51,015
- Wow!
- Stand back!

860
01:12:02,375 --> 01:12:05,556
Milky-White. You’re back!
I can't believe it!

861
01:12:05,684 --> 01:12:07,625
It’s almost midnight!

862
01:12:07,768 --> 01:12:10,416
Quiet! Feed the objects to the cow.

863
01:12:10,552 --> 01:12:12,744
- What?
- You heard me!

864
01:12:12,856 --> 01:12:14,400
Feed them to the cow

865
01:12:14,514 --> 01:12:16,206
Really!

866
01:12:23,491 --> 01:12:27,116
Fill with the milk. I’ll do it.
She’ll only milk for me. -Good boy

867
01:12:39,335 --> 01:12:42,594
Squeeze, pal! You can do it.

868
01:12:45,780 --> 01:12:47,618
Not working!

869
01:12:52,840 --> 01:12:54,555
Wrong ingredients.

870
01:12:57,821 --> 01:13:00,271
Forget about a child!

871
01:13:00,390 --> 01:13:02,271
No, no, no...

872
01:13:02,391 --> 01:13:05,730
Wait! We followed your instructions.
One, the cow is as white as milk. Correct?

873
01:13:05,866 --> 01:13:07,256
Yes.

874
01:13:07,377 --> 01:13:09,477
And two, the cape was certainly as red
as blood. -Yes

875
01:13:09,605 --> 01:13:14,050
And three, the slipper... -Yes And four, I
compared the hair with this ear of corn. -Yes

876
01:13:14,170 --> 01:13:16,243
I pulled it from a
maiden in a tower and...

877
01:13:17,016 --> 01:13:18,472
You what?!

878
01:13:18,591 --> 01:13:21,464
What were you doing there? Well, nothing.
I happened to be passing by...

879
01:13:21,593 --> 01:13:27,018
I touched that hair! I told you! I
cannot have touched the ingredients!

880
01:13:28,113 --> 01:13:31,212
Nooooo... The corn! The corn! You can
use the silky hair of the corn...

881
01:13:34,018 --> 01:13:35,724
Yes! Yes!

882
01:13:35,844 --> 01:13:38,101
Pull it from the ear and feed it
to the cow. Quickly!

883
01:13:45,385 --> 01:13:49,166
- It’s working!
- She’s milking!

884
01:13:50,214 --> 01:13:52,334
At last!

885
01:14:53,222 --> 01:14:57,108
And it came to pass, all that seemed
wrong was now right.

886
01:14:57,769 --> 01:15:00,880
The Witch succeeded in
reversing her mother’s curse.

887
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:05,056
Cinderella finally stopped
running from her Prince.

888
01:15:06,401 --> 01:15:09,631
Jack was reunited with his beloved cow

889
01:15:09,744 --> 01:15:12,823
and his mother could now dress in
the best a golden egg could buy.

890
01:15:13,730 --> 01:15:18,644
And the Baker and his Wife were proud
parents of a strapping baby boy.

891
01:15:21,994 --> 01:15:24,314
Thanks for the slipper.

892
01:15:49,901 --> 01:15:53,741
Attention! Let us cheer the newlyweds as they
embark on their happy bliss today, and ever after...

893
01:15:54,649 --> 01:15:58,689
And so with the kingdom
filled with joy, those who

894
01:15:58,715 --> 01:16:02,674
deserved to were destined
to live happily ever...

895
01:16:14,996 --> 01:16:16,718
Jack? Jack...?

896
01:16:16,869 --> 01:16:19,822
Attention! Attention!

897
01:16:19,934 --> 01:16:23,766
Let there be no
panic. NO PANIC!

898
01:16:25,804 --> 01:16:28,898
The Royal Prince wishes to
address his loyal subjects.

899
01:16:29,042 --> 01:16:30,947
Attention!

900
01:16:33,149 --> 01:16:40,932
There’s no need for worry. It was an earthquake
in a far-off quadrant of our kingdom.

901
01:16:41,092 --> 01:16:43,028
Nothing to fear at all.

902
01:16:43,162 --> 01:16:46,970
I would personally
investigate the disturbance.

903
01:16:47,781 --> 01:16:50,710
Now everyone, back to your
villages, and on with

904
01:16:50,831 --> 01:16:52,416
your lives!

905
01:16:53,389 --> 01:16:55,913
But as they made their way back into
the woods,

906
01:16:56,040 --> 01:16:58,849
their familiar paths
were nowhere to be found

907
01:17:00,111 --> 01:17:03,960
and their lives were about
to take an unexpected turn.

908
01:17:11,096 --> 01:17:13,328
Everything’s so different.

909
01:17:16,951 --> 01:17:19,510
Hello, little one.

910
01:17:20,500 --> 01:17:22,516
Hello, Mr. BAKER.
- You alright?

911
01:17:23,277 --> 01:17:26,112
What are you doing here? With a
suitcase?

912
01:17:26,232 --> 01:17:29,833
I’m moving in with Granny. Our whole village collapsed.
I couldn’t find my mother anywhere.

913
01:17:29,839 --> 01:17:31,788
And now I can’t find
my Granny’s cottage.

914
01:17:31,908 --> 01:17:36,176
What do you mean? -I went down the
dell, and I didn’t recognize anything.

915
01:17:36,296 --> 01:17:39,738
There was no path. Where’s she?
Where’s Granny?

916
01:17:39,876 --> 01:17:42,507
Calm, calm. Ok. We can help you
find Granny’s without the path.

917
01:17:44,272 --> 01:17:46,922
Please take him for a few moments.
- Really!

918
01:17:47,987 --> 01:17:50,663
Why does he always cry when I hold
him?

919
01:17:51,330 --> 01:17:53,990
You needn’t hold him as
if he was so fragile.

920
01:17:54,134 --> 01:17:57,510
He doesn’t want me. He wants his mother! I
can’t take care of him all of the time.

921
01:17:57,630 --> 01:18:01,091
I’ll take care of him... when he’s
older...

922
01:18:02,789 --> 01:18:07,016
Who might that be? It’s the
Steward and the royal family.

923
01:18:08,856 --> 01:18:10,272
Hello, there!

924
01:18:10,420 --> 01:18:13,813
What brings you into the woods?
- The castle has been destroyed.

925
01:18:13,933 --> 01:18:16,104
No! The kingdom is under attack.

926
01:18:16,232 --> 01:18:17,799
What is the Royal family going to do?

927
01:18:17,940 --> 01:18:20,517
I have no idea! I don’t make policy.
I just carry it out.

928
01:18:20,652 --> 01:18:23,492
I think it best we get back to the village.
We’ll take the girl with us.

929
01:18:23,522 --> 01:18:25,082
You come with us.

930
01:18:44,456 --> 01:18:49,642
It’s a giant!
- A giant woman!

931
01:18:49,763 --> 01:18:53,821
Where is the lad who
killed my husband?

932
01:18:53,956 --> 01:18:56,792
There is no lad here!
We haven’t seen him.

933
01:18:56,920 --> 01:19:02,056
We’ll get him for you right away.
Don’t move!

934
01:19:02,184 --> 01:19:04,798
It was you who destroyed our
house - not an earthquake.

935
01:19:04,942 --> 01:19:10,880
And who destroyed my house?
I want him!

936
01:19:11,016 --> 01:19:14,844
Would you like a blind girl instead?

937
01:19:14,972 --> 01:19:19,004
How dare you? She wants the boy!

938
01:19:19,122 --> 01:19:22,210
Jack! Has anyone seen my Jack? He
ran off again and I’ve been...

939
01:19:22,356 --> 01:19:25,863
She’s looking for him too.

940
01:19:25,990 --> 01:19:30,183
Give him to me!

941
01:19:31,503 --> 01:19:35,642
Jack is just a lad! We had no food
to eat so he sold his beloved cow

942
01:19:35,763 --> 01:19:38,773
in exchange for magic beans.

943
01:19:38,900 --> 01:19:41,621
The boy - I want the boy!

944
01:19:41,740 --> 01:19:46,162
You leave my boy alone!
- I’m waiting!

945
01:19:46,314 --> 01:19:48,658
Don’t make her angry, woman, or you’ll
get us all killed!

946
01:19:48,810 --> 01:19:53,990
Flouncing through our kingdom with your great big
clodhopppers, destroying everything in your path.

947
01:19:54,125 --> 01:20:02,125
You big bully! I’ll hide my son
and you’ll never find him.

948
01:20:02,545 --> 01:20:04,959
You’ll never, ever... Get back woman!

949
01:20:05,105 --> 01:20:08,908
The boy is hiding in the steeple
tower. You can find him there.

950
01:20:09,041 --> 01:20:10,236
Yes, that’s true.

951
01:20:10,372 --> 01:20:13,660
Yes. The steeple tower.We saw him there!
If he is not,

952
01:20:13,789 --> 01:20:19,014
I will return tonight and find you!

953
01:20:21,190 --> 01:20:22,766
All of you!

954
01:20:35,597 --> 01:20:37,515
Look! What have you done to her?

955
01:20:38,387 --> 01:20:41,609
ÃÇÐÇ ÝÚáÊ áåÇ¿

956
01:20:41,737 --> 01:20:45,034
I didn’t mean to hurt her. I was just
thinking of the greater good.

957
01:20:45,178 --> 01:20:50,346
Listen everyone. If we’re going to get
through this we have to stick together.

958
01:20:50,507 --> 01:20:55,168
Some people are cut out to battle
giants, and others are not.

959
01:20:55,304 --> 01:21:01,118
I don’t have the constitution. And as long
as I can be of no help, I’m going to hide.

960
01:21:01,248 --> 01:21:05,914
Let’s go! Everything will
work out fine in the end.

961
01:21:06,032 --> 01:21:08,760
Not always.

962
01:21:08,888 --> 01:21:11,368
I don’t know where they think they’re going.
The giant’s already destroyed

963
01:21:11,394 --> 01:21:13,642
the entire village.

964
01:21:13,768 --> 01:21:16,995
Only thing left of my
garden are these beans.

965
01:21:17,112 --> 01:21:19,996
What are we going to do now?
- We have no choice.

966
01:21:20,108 --> 01:21:22,350
Find the boy and give her what she wants.

967
01:21:22,472 --> 01:21:27,376
But if we do, she’ll kill Jack. And if
we don’t she’ll kill half the kingdom!

968
01:21:30,296 --> 01:21:33,924
Promise me you won’t let them get Jack.
Promise!

969
01:21:34,052 --> 01:21:36,386
Okay, I promise.

970
01:21:50,060 --> 01:21:53,610
Rapunzel!

971
01:21:53,738 --> 01:21:56,051
You’re safe!

972
01:21:56,170 --> 01:21:58,178
Thank goodness.

973
01:21:59,771 --> 01:22:03,330
- Who are you?
- Surely you remember?

974
01:22:03,458 --> 01:22:06,252
Of course you don’t recognize me, Mother!

975
01:22:07,655 --> 01:22:13,798
This is who I truly am, my dear. Now you
don’t have to be embarrassed by me.

976
01:22:13,933 --> 01:22:16,736
You must come with me.
There’s a Giant in the land.

977
01:22:18,113 --> 01:22:20,139
My darling. Are you all right?
Why did you run off?

978
01:22:20,275 --> 01:22:21,929
I was afraid.
- Come with me.

979
01:22:21,930 --> 01:22:24,660
She’s not going with you!
You will come with me.

980
01:22:24,786 --> 01:22:27,314
I will not come with you!

981
01:22:27,474 --> 01:22:30,340
Then you leave me no choice.

982
01:22:33,624 --> 01:22:34,604
No!

983
01:22:38,309 --> 01:22:41,900
OMG!
You! The one who blinded me.

984
01:22:43,055 --> 01:22:46,064
- And locked me in a tower.
- To protect you.

985
01:22:46,200 --> 01:22:48,773
...and then banished me to an
island... in the middle of a swamp!

986
01:22:48,908 --> 01:22:51,756
I was just trying to be a good mother!

987
01:22:53,010 --> 01:22:55,404
Rapunzel, no!

988
01:22:55,524 --> 01:22:58,424
You will never be safe with him.
- Take me away from here.

989
01:22:58,560 --> 01:23:02,637
Don’t you understand? I never want to
see you again. Ever!

990
01:23:03,686 --> 01:23:07,238
RAPUNZEL, the giant!

991
01:23:19,203 --> 01:23:22,618
NO MATTER WHAT YOU SAY

992
01:23:22,753 --> 01:23:25,793
CHILDREN WON’T LISTEN

993
01:23:25,937 --> 01:23:32,284
NO MATTER WHAT YOU
KNOW CHILDREN REFUSE

994
01:23:32,428 --> 01:23:39,510
TO LEARN. GUIDE
THEM ALONG THE WAY

995
01:23:39,646 --> 01:23:46,438
STILL THEY DON’T LISTEN.
CHILDREN CAN ONLY GROW

996
01:23:46,590 --> 01:23:54,590
FROM SOMETHING YOU LOVE
TO SOMETHING YOU LOSE

997
01:23:57,788 --> 01:23:59,218
Jack!

998
01:23:59,330 --> 01:24:01,346
Jack!
Jack!

999
01:24:01,474 --> 01:24:03,219
Jack! where are you?

1000
01:24:03,323 --> 01:24:04,465
Jack!

1001
01:24:04,594 --> 01:24:08,852
We’re never going to find him. -We should fan out.
It’ll increase our chances.

1002
01:24:08,966 --> 01:24:10,786
- No. You can’t be on your own.
- I’ll be all right.

1003
01:24:10,906 --> 01:24:14,085
- What if we get lost? -We’ll
count our steps from right here.

1004
01:24:14,212 --> 01:24:16,078
- I’ll go, too.
- No.

1005
01:24:16,238 --> 01:24:21,228
You stay right here with the baby.

1006
01:24:21,380 --> 01:24:24,701
We'll be right back.

1007
01:24:24,829 --> 01:24:27,842
- You would leave our son with her?
- Yes. He’s asleep.

1008
01:24:27,970 --> 01:24:31,840
He’ll be safe with the girl. -I am
very capable of caring for the baby.

1009
01:24:31,992 --> 01:24:33,632
- See? -But what if the
Giant comes back...

1010
01:24:33,642 --> 01:24:36,170
What if, what if! Five
hundred paces.

1011
01:24:36,306 --> 01:24:40,338
Go! 1 2 3

1012
01:24:40,458 --> 01:24:41,265
Wait!

1013
01:24:41,433 --> 01:24:42,897
Here.

1014
01:24:43,815 --> 01:24:47,490
Take this. It might be cold.

1015
01:24:47,643 --> 01:24:51,737
Ok. 1 2 3 4

1016
01:24:51,858 --> 01:24:54,100
- 5 6
- Jack!

1017
01:24:55,768 --> 01:24:59,016
- 9 10
- Jack!

1018
01:25:03,655 --> 01:25:08,749
69 70
71 72 73 74

1019
01:25:11,637 --> 01:25:12,925
ãÑÍÈÇ

1020
01:25:13,061 --> 01:25:15,141
Hello, Your Royal Highness.

1021
01:25:15,254 --> 01:25:16,541
Hello.

1022
01:25:17,177 --> 01:25:21,076
Hello again. We met before actually.

1023
01:25:21,197 --> 01:25:23,621
Yes, Of course.

1024
01:25:25,453 --> 01:25:28,803
You must be here to slay the Giant.

1025
01:25:28,948 --> 01:25:32,923
- The Giant? Yes. Surely you’ve heard
there is a giant in our...

1026
01:25:33,075 --> 01:25:36,473
midst. Not an earthquake...

1027
01:25:37,298 --> 01:25:38,473
Of course.

1028
01:25:39,099 --> 01:25:40,577
A giant.

1029
01:25:41,789 --> 01:25:46,495
Yes, it’s a lady giant.
It's a very unusual, huh?

1030
01:25:47,236 --> 01:25:52,912
I should think. And why are
you alone in the woods?

1031
01:25:53,063 --> 01:25:56,989
-Well, I came with my husband.

1032
01:25:57,117 --> 01:26:01,341
We were... well you see...
it’s a long story.

1033
01:26:02,675 --> 01:26:08,020
He would let you roam alone in the woods?
- No, actually it was my choice.

1034
01:26:10,886 --> 01:26:13,204
- How brave!
- Brave

1035
01:26:13,339 --> 01:26:14,715
Yes.

1036
01:26:16,443 --> 01:26:19,661
ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN IN THE WOODS

1037
01:26:20,663 --> 01:26:26,158
MAY I KISS YOU? ANY MOMENT
WE COULD BE CRUSHED -Uh...

1038
01:26:27,340 --> 01:26:28,418
DON’T FEEL RUSHED.

1039
01:26:32,190 --> 01:26:35,011
THIS IS RIDICULOUS, WHAT AM I DOING HERE?
I’M IN THE WRONG STORY.

1040
01:26:39,796 --> 01:26:42,129
Wait one moment, please! We can’t do this!
You have a Princess!

1041
01:26:42,263 --> 01:26:45,259
Well, yes, I do. -And
I have a... baker.

1042
01:26:47,849 --> 01:26:49,243
Of course,

1043
01:26:50,217 --> 01:26:53,071
you’re right. How foolish.

1044
01:26:53,920 --> 01:26:57,734
FOOLISHNESS CAN HAPPEN IN THE WOODS

1045
01:26:57,878 --> 01:27:03,282
ONCE AGAIN, PLEASE... LET
YOUR HESITATIONS BE HUSHED.

1046
01:27:04,713 --> 01:27:12,713
ANY MOMENT, BIG OR SMALL, IS A MOMENT, AFTER ALL.
SEIZE THE MOMENT, SKIES MAY FALL ANY MOMENT.

1047
01:27:18,181 --> 01:27:21,924
But this is not right!

1048
01:27:22,757 --> 01:27:26,393
RIGHT AND WRONG DON’T
MATTER IN THE WOODS

1049
01:27:26,562 --> 01:27:31,092
ONLY FEELINGS. LET US MEET
THE MOMENT UNBLUSHED

1050
01:27:32,676 --> 01:27:35,282
LIFE IS OFTEN
SO UNPLEASANT...

1051
01:27:35,434 --> 01:27:39,876
YOU MUST KNOW THAT, AS A PEASANT... BEST
TO TAKE THE MOMENT PRESENT

1052
01:27:40,028 --> 01:27:43,264
AS A PRESENT FOR THE
MOMENT.

1053
01:27:48,990 --> 01:27:50,621
77 78

1054
01:27:50,740 --> 01:27:52,939
479 480

1055
01:27:53,051 --> 01:27:57,063
481 482 Excuse me, ma’am.

1056
01:27:57,191 --> 01:28:00,192
Have you seen a boy...

1057
01:28:00,322 --> 01:28:05,597
He is about so high... -I’m
sorry, may I be of some service?

1058
01:28:06,613 --> 01:28:08,990
The tree has fallen.

1059
01:28:09,101 --> 01:28:11,025
Mother’s grave, destroyed.

1060
01:28:12,082 --> 01:28:13,386
Oh. I’m sorry.

1061
01:28:13,521 --> 01:28:17,793
I shouldn’t complain. I’m sure others
have suffered worse after the earthquake

1062
01:28:19,716 --> 01:28:25,075
Earthquake? It’s no earthquake... there’s
a giant terrorizing the kingdom!

1063
01:28:25,909 --> 01:28:29,207
Well, I’m sure the Prince will see to
it that the Giant is rid from our land.

1064
01:28:30,271 --> 01:28:34,639
Hah, the Prince? No doubt he’s off
somewhere seducing some young maiden.

1065
01:28:34,759 --> 01:28:36,039
What?

1066
01:28:36,151 --> 01:28:38,777
You look just like the Princess... but
dirty.

1067
01:28:38,897 --> 01:28:41,598
Oh no, you are the Princess!
- I’m sorry. I didn’t recognize you.

1068
01:28:41,714 --> 01:28:45,183
No, no. Please... Get up! I’m not a
princess here.

1069
01:28:47,336 --> 01:28:50,895
I had to disguise myself. I’m not
permitted to leave the palace unescorted.

1070
01:28:57,275 --> 01:28:59,228
If you’d like you can come with me.

1071
01:29:00,063 --> 01:29:04,983
You will be safe in our company.
- Thank you.

1072
01:29:07,737 --> 01:29:08,417
-This way.

1073
01:29:17,644 --> 01:29:21,628
- I must leave you. Now I
must go off to slay a giant.

1074
01:29:28,238 --> 01:29:30,773
I shall not forget you.

1075
01:29:30,893 --> 01:29:34,337
How brave you are to
be alone in the woods.

1076
01:29:34,448 --> 01:29:37,250
And how alive you’ve
made me feel.

1077
01:29:43,894 --> 01:29:46,650
What was that?

1078
01:29:50,208 --> 01:29:53,051
WAS THAT ME? WAS THAT
HIM?

1079
01:29:53,188 --> 01:30:01,107
DID A PRINCE REALLY KISS ME AND KISS ME?
AND KISS ME?

1080
01:30:02,305 --> 01:30:07,709
AND DID I KISS HIM BACK?
WAS IT WRONG?

1081
01:30:07,837 --> 01:30:13,818
AM I MAD? IS THAT ALL? DOES HE MISS ME?
WAS HE SUDDENLY GETTING BORED WITH ME?

1082
01:30:13,952 --> 01:30:17,910
WAKE UP! STOP DREAMING

1083
01:30:18,046 --> 01:30:19,599
STOP PRANCING
ABOUT THE WOODS

1084
01:30:20,288 --> 01:30:24,148
IT’S NOT BESEEMING. WHAT
IS IT ABOUT THE WOODS?

1085
01:30:24,276 --> 01:30:26,854
BACK TO LIFE, BACK TO
SENSE, BACK TO CHILD

1086
01:30:26,974 --> 01:30:29,549
BACK TO HUSBAND, NO ONE
LIVES IN THE WOODS.

1087
01:30:30,985 --> 01:30:34,822
THERE ARE VOWS, THERE ARE TIES, THERE
ARE NEEDS, THERE ARE STANDARDS

1088
01:30:34,942 --> 01:30:37,849
THERE ARE SHOULDN’TS AND
SHOULDS.

1089
01:30:37,976 --> 01:30:43,535
WHY NOT BOTH INSTEAD? THERE’S
THE ANSWER, IF YOU’RE CLEVER:

1090
01:30:44,816 --> 01:30:50,152
HAVE A CHILD FOR WARMTH AND A BAKER FOR
BREAD, AND A PRINCE

1091
01:30:50,274 --> 01:30:53,303
FOR WHATEVER...

1092
01:30:53,423 --> 01:30:56,606
NEVER! IT’S THESE WOODS.

1093
01:30:57,662 --> 01:30:59,474
FACE THE FACTS, FIND THE BOY

1094
01:30:59,618 --> 01:31:01,379
JOIN THE GROUP, STOP THE GIANT

1095
01:31:01,507 --> 01:31:03,672
JUST GET OUT OF THESE WOODS.

1096
01:31:04,341 --> 01:31:06,050
WAS THAT HIM? YES IT WAS.

1097
01:31:06,186 --> 01:31:07,841
WAS THAT ME? NO, IT WASN’T

1098
01:31:07,977 --> 01:31:09,777
JUST A TRICK OF THE WOODS.

1099
01:31:11,132 --> 01:31:16,338
JUST A MOMENT, ONE
PECULIAR PASSING MOMENT...

1100
01:31:17,575 --> 01:31:22,216
MUST IT ALL BE EITHER LESS OR
MORE, EITHER PLAIN OR GRAND?

1101
01:31:22,344 --> 01:31:25,796
IS IT ALWAYS “OR”?
IS IT NEVER “AND”?

1102
01:31:27,091 --> 01:31:29,843
THAT’S WHAT WOODS ARE FOR:

1103
01:31:29,995 --> 01:31:33,647
FOR THOSE MOMENTS IN THE WOODS.

1104
01:31:33,784 --> 01:31:37,881
OH, IF LIFE WERE MADE OF MOMENTS

1105
01:31:38,025 --> 01:31:40,934
EVEN NOW AND THEN A BAD ONE...!

1106
01:31:41,070 --> 01:31:47,597
BUT IF LIFE WERE ONLY MOMENTS.
THEN YOU’D NEVER KNOW YOU HAD ONE

1107
01:31:49,249 --> 01:31:51,660
FIRST A WITCH, THEN A
CHILD, THEN A PRINCE

1108
01:31:51,780 --> 01:31:54,945
THEN A MOMENT... WHO CAN
LIVE IN THE WOODS?

1109
01:31:55,729 --> 01:31:59,099
AND TO GET WHAT YOU WISH,
ONLY JUST FOR A MOMENT...

1110
01:31:59,220 --> 01:32:01,146
THESE ARE DANGEROUS WOODS...

1111
01:32:02,498 --> 01:32:08,972
LET THE MOMENT GO. DON’T FORGET
IT FOR A MOMENT, THOUGH.

1112
01:32:09,091 --> 01:32:14,726
JUST REMEMBERING YOU’VE HAD AN
“AND,” WHEN YOU’RE BACK TO “OR”

1113
01:32:15,930 --> 01:32:21,115
MAKES THE “OR” MEAN
MORE THAN IT DID BEFORE

1114
01:32:22,822 --> 01:32:29,883
NOW I UNDERSTAND... AND IT’S
TIME TO LEAVE THE WOODS!

1115
01:32:47,224 --> 01:32:47,724
72 73

1116
01:33:40,578 --> 01:33:43,330
- She should be back by now.
- She wouldn’t get lost.

1117
01:33:43,435 --> 01:33:45,445
I’m sure she’ll return.

1118
01:33:45,590 --> 01:33:50,231
- No, I must go and look for her...
- Look who I found!

1119
01:33:50,366 --> 01:33:51,811
You’re hurting me!
- Let go of him!

1120
01:33:51,938 --> 01:33:53,818
I’ll let go of him when I
give him to the Giant.

1121
01:33:53,867 --> 01:33:56,243
Make her stop!
- Leave him alone!

1122
01:33:56,371 --> 01:34:00,083
- Keep away from him.
- Stop! I said stop!

1123
01:34:02,203 --> 01:34:05,133
Where did you find this?

1124
01:34:05,751 --> 01:34:09,413
I’m sorry, sir...
- It’s my wife’s!

1125
01:34:10,461 --> 01:34:13,772
I’m sorry. I came upon her. She
was at the bottom of a cliff...

1126
01:34:14,738 --> 01:34:16,781
What are you saying?

1127
01:34:16,901 --> 01:34:21,077
How awful...
- No. No...!

1128
01:34:23,702 --> 01:34:24,984
This is my fault.

1129
01:34:25,703 --> 01:34:28,288
I let her wander off alone.

1130
01:34:29,073 --> 01:34:32,812
I should have made her stay with me.
- Remorse will get you nowhere.

1131
01:34:32,940 --> 01:34:36,335
My wife is dead! -Wake up!
When you’re dead, you’re dead.

1132
01:34:36,455 --> 01:34:39,855
Now it’s time to get this boy to the Giant
before we’re all... Keep away from him. -No!

1133
01:34:40,117 --> 01:34:44,369
This is no time to be soft-hearted! He’s
going to the Giant and I’m taking him.

1134
01:34:44,481 --> 01:34:46,807
Yes! He’s the one to blame!

1135
01:34:46,943 --> 01:34:49,891
It’s because of you there’s a giant
in our midst and my wife is dead!

1136
01:34:50,442 --> 01:34:52,985
BUT IT ISN’T MY FAULT, I WAS
GIVEN THOSE BEANS! YOU PERSUADED

1137
01:34:53,011 --> 01:34:55,595
ME TO TRADE AWAY MY COW FOR
BEANS! AND WITHOUT THOSE BEANS

1138
01:34:55,705 --> 01:35:00,132
THERE’D HAVE BEEN NO STALK TO GET UP
TO THE GIANTS IN THE FIRST PLACE!

1139
01:35:00,259 --> 01:35:03,059
WAIT A MINUTE... MAGIC BEANS FOR A COW
SO OLD THAT YOU HAD TO TELL A LIE

1140
01:35:03,066 --> 01:35:05,140
TO SELL IT, WHICH YOU TOLD!
WERE THEY WORTHLESS BEANS?

1141
01:35:05,166 --> 01:35:07,164
WERE THEY OVERSOLD?

1142
01:35:07,284 --> 01:35:09,862
OH, AND TELL US WHO PERSUADED
YOU TO STEAL THAT GOLD!

1143
01:35:09,993 --> 01:35:11,370
- SEE, IT’S YOUR FAULT.
- No!

1144
01:35:11,478 --> 01:35:12,545
- YES, IT IS!
- It's no!

1145
01:35:12,681 --> 01:35:13,681
IT’S TRUE.
- WAIT A MINUTE,

1146
01:35:13,687 --> 01:35:16,306
THOUGH... I ONLY STOLE
THE GOLD TO GET MY COW BACK FROM YOU!

1147
01:35:16,450 --> 01:35:18,210
SO IT’S YOUR FAULT!
- YES! -NO, IT ISN’T!

1148
01:35:18,338 --> 01:35:21,066
I’D HAVE KEPT THOSE BEANS,
BUT OUR HOUSE WAS CURSED.

1149
01:35:21,186 --> 01:35:23,491
SHE MADE US GET A COW TO
GET THE CURSE REVERSED!

1150
01:35:23,691 --> 01:35:25,770
IT’S HIS FATHER’S FAULT
THAT THE CURSE GOT PLACED

1151
01:35:25,796 --> 01:35:27,624
AND THE PLACE GOT CURSED
IN THE FIRST PLACE!

1152
01:35:27,752 --> 01:35:29,758
OH. THEN IT’S HIS FAULT!
- SO. -IT WAS HIS FAULT.

1153
01:35:29,918 --> 01:35:30,958
NO. -YES, IT IS, IT’S HIS.

1154
01:35:31,058 --> 01:35:31,921
I GUESS...
- WAIT A MINUTE

1155
01:35:31,922 --> 01:35:34,749
THOUGH... I CHOPPED DOWN THE BEANSTALK, RIGHT?
THAT’S CLEAR.

1156
01:35:34,775 --> 01:35:36,931
BUT WITHOUT ANY BEANSTALK,
THEN WHAT’S QUEER

1157
01:35:37,026 --> 01:35:40,066
IS HOW DID THE SECOND GIANT GET DOWN
HERE IN THE FIRST PLACE? SECOND PLACE...

1158
01:35:40,148 --> 01:35:40,691
YES!
- HOW?

1159
01:35:40,692 --> 01:35:42,216
HMM... WELL, WHO HAD

1160
01:35:42,349 --> 01:35:44,927
THE OTHER BEAN? -THE OTHER BEAN? -THE OTHER BEAN?
YOU POCKETED THE OTHER BEAN.

1161
01:35:44,928 --> 01:35:46,199
I DIDN’T! YES, I DID.

1162
01:35:46,327 --> 01:35:47,671
- SO IT’S YOUR FAULT...! NO, IT ISN’T
‘CAUSE I GAVE IT TO MY WIFE!

1163
01:35:47,817 --> 01:35:49,138
SO IT’S HER FAULT...!
NO, IT ISN’T!

1164
01:35:49,180 --> 01:35:49,939
THEN WHOSE IS IT?
WAIT A MINUTE!

1165
01:35:49,940 --> 01:35:52,809
SHE EXCHANGED THAT BEAN
TO OBTAIN YOUR SHOE,

1166
01:35:52,945 --> 01:35:55,358
SO THE ONE WHO KNOWS WHAT HAPPENED TO
THE BEAN IS YOU! YOU MEAN THAT OLD

1167
01:35:55,384 --> 01:35:57,696
BEAN THAT YOUR WIFE...? OH, DEAR...
BUT I NEVER KNEW, AND SO I THREW...

1168
01:35:57,792 --> 01:35:59,702
WELL, DON’T LOOK HERE!

1169
01:35:59,830 --> 01:36:01,448
SO IT’S YOUR FAULT! -BUT...
- SEE, IT’S HER FAULT...! -BUT-

1170
01:36:01,600 --> 01:36:04,301
AND IT ISN’T MINE AT ALL!
- BUT WHAT?

1171
01:36:04,460 --> 01:36:06,676
WELL, IF YOU HADN’T
GONE BACK UP AGAIN...

1172
01:36:06,677 --> 01:36:08,742
YOU WERE GREEDY! DID
YOU NEED THAT HEN?

1173
01:36:09,245 --> 01:36:10,898
- BUT I GOT IT FOR MY MOTHER...!
- SO IT’S HER FAULT THEN!

1174
01:36:10,899 --> 01:36:13,868
YES, AND WHAT ABOUT THE HARP IN
THE THIRD PLACE? THE HARP... YES!

1175
01:36:13,869 --> 01:36:15,659
SHE WENT AND DARED ME TO! -I DARED YOU TO?
- YOU DARED ME TO!

1176
01:36:15,685 --> 01:36:17,256
SHE SAID THAT I WAS SCARED... -ME?
... TO. SHE DARED ME!

1177
01:36:17,285 --> 01:36:19,405
- NO, I DIDN’T!
- SO IT’S YOUR FAULT! -WAIT A MINUTE...!

1178
01:36:19,524 --> 01:36:23,265
IF YOU HADN’T DARED HIM TO... AND YOU HAD LEFT THE HARP ALONE,
WE WOULDN’T BE IN TROUBLE IN THE FIRST PLACE! WELL, IF YOU

1179
01:36:23,291 --> 01:36:31,123
HADN’T THROWN -WELL, IF SHE HADN’T RAISED THEM IN THE FIRST PLACE...!
AWAY THE BEAN IN THE FIRST PLACE...! IT WAS YOUR FAULT!

1180
01:36:42,366 --> 01:36:47,823
IT’S THE LAST MIDNIGHT.

1181
01:36:47,964 --> 01:36:55,964
IT’S THE LAST WISH.
IT’S THE LAST MIDNIGHT

1182
01:36:59,402 --> 01:37:02,902
SOON IT WILL BE BOOM... SQUISH!

1183
01:37:04,816 --> 01:37:09,777
TOLD A LITTLE LIE,
STOLE A LITTLE GOLD,

1184
01:37:09,905 --> 01:37:16,165
BROKE A LITTLE VOW, DID YOU?
HAD TO GET YOUR PRINCE

1185
01:37:16,293 --> 01:37:17,877
HAD TO GET YOUR COW

1186
01:37:18,022 --> 01:37:20,754
HAD TO GET YOUR WISH, DOESN’T
MATTER HOW... ANYWAY

1187
01:37:20,906 --> 01:37:26,523
IT DOESN’T MATTER NOW.
- IT’S THE LAST MIDNIGHT

1188
01:37:26,670 --> 01:37:30,784
IT’S THE BOOM... SPLAT!

1189
01:37:30,936 --> 01:37:34,717
NOTHING BUT A VAST MIDNIGHT

1190
01:37:34,835 --> 01:37:38,767
EVERYBODY SMASHED FLAT!

1191
01:37:38,910 --> 01:37:42,582
NOTHING WE CAN DO...
NOT EXACTLY TRUE:

1192
01:37:43,233 --> 01:37:45,368
WE CAN ALWAYS GIVE HER THE BOY.

1193
01:37:46,200 --> 01:37:50,976
NO? NO, OF COURSE WHAT REALLY MATTERS IS THE BLAME.
SOMEONE YOU CAN BLAME. FINE

1194
01:37:51,278 --> 01:37:53,671
IF THAT’S THE THING YOU ENJOY,
PLACING THE BLAME,

1195
01:37:54,889 --> 01:37:58,011
IF THAT’S THE AIM, GIVE ME THE
BLAME...

1196
01:37:58,679 --> 01:38:01,702
JUST GIVE ME THE BOY.

1197
01:38:02,933 --> 01:38:03,886
No.

1198
01:38:05,611 --> 01:38:11,753
YOU’RE SO NICE. YOU’RE
NOT GOOD, YOU’RE NOT BAD

1199
01:38:11,897 --> 01:38:15,913
YOU’RE JUST NICE. I’M NOT GOOD,
I’M NOT NICE,

1200
01:38:15,914 --> 01:38:17,698
I’M JUST RIGHT

1201
01:38:18,194 --> 01:38:25,039
I’M THE WITCH. YOU’RE THE WORLD.

1202
01:38:25,192 --> 01:38:30,257
I’M THE HITCH, I’M WHAT NO ONE BELIEVES,
I’M THE WITCH.

1203
01:38:30,418 --> 01:38:34,281
YOU’RE ALL LIARS AND THIEVES.
LIKE HIS FATHER,

1204
01:38:34,424 --> 01:38:38,183
LIKE HIS SON WILL BE, TOO... OH, WHY BOTHER?

1205
01:38:38,368 --> 01:38:44,192
YOU’LL JUST DO WHAT YOU DO.
IT’S THE LAST

1206
01:38:44,344 --> 01:38:50,420
MIDNIGHT. SO GOODBYE,
ALL. COMING AT YOU FAST,

1207
01:38:50,539 --> 01:38:56,730
MIDNIGHT... SOON YOU’LL
SEE THE SKY FALL.

1208
01:38:56,882 --> 01:39:00,581
HERE, YOU WANT A BEAN?
- HAVE ANOTHER BEAN

1209
01:39:00,582 --> 01:39:01,982
BEANS WERE MADE FOR
MAKING YOU RICH!

1210
01:39:04,071 --> 01:39:07,254
PLANT THEM AND THEY SOAR...
HERE, YOU WANT SOME MORE?

1211
01:39:07,843 --> 01:39:11,340
LISTEN TO THE ROAR: GIANTS BY THE SCORE...!
OH WELL, YOU CAN BLAME ANOTHER WITCH.

1212
01:39:11,366 --> 01:39:14,930
IT’S THE LAST MIDNIGHT

1213
01:39:15,366 --> 01:39:22,415
IT’S THE LAST VERSE. NOW,
BEFORE IT’S PAST MIDNIGHT

1214
01:39:22,760 --> 01:39:27,159
I’M LEAVING YOU MY LAST CURSE:
I’M LEAVING YOU ALONE. YOU

1215
01:39:27,185 --> 01:39:31,178
CAN TEND THE GARDEN, IT’S YOURS.
SEPARATE AND ALONE,

1216
01:39:31,179 --> 01:39:39,179
EVERYBODY DOWN ON ALL FOURS.
ALL RIGHT, MOTHER... WHEN?

1217
01:39:39,969 --> 01:39:46,373
LOST THE BEANS AGAIN! PUNISH ME THE WAY YOU DID THEN!
GIVE ME CLAWS AND A HUNCH, JUST AWAY

1218
01:39:46,399 --> 01:39:52,716
FROM THIS BUNCH AND THE GLOOM
AND THE DOOM AND THE BOOM

1219
01:40:18,163 --> 01:40:20,375
Maybe I shouldn't have
stolen from the Giant...

1220
01:40:20,489 --> 01:40:22,560
Maybe I shouldn’t have
strayed from the path...

1221
01:40:22,689 --> 01:40:25,052
Maybe I shouldn’t have
attended the Ball...

1222
01:40:25,180 --> 01:40:28,763
- Yes. Maybe you shouldn’t have...
- Where are you going?

1223
01:40:28,883 --> 01:40:32,153
- Away from here. -But you said we had
to find our way out of this together.

1224
01:40:32,272 --> 01:40:35,013
It doesn’t matter whether
we’re together or apart.

1225
01:40:35,157 --> 01:40:36,046
We need your help.

1226
01:40:36,173 --> 01:40:40,387
You don’t understand. I depended on my wife
for everything. She was the one who helped.

1227
01:40:40,499 --> 01:40:42,325
Åí ßÇäÊ ãä ÓÇÚÏÊäí

1228
01:40:42,445 --> 01:40:47,396
You would leave your child? -He’ll be
happier in the arms of a Princess...

1229
01:40:47,524 --> 01:40:49,573
But wait...

1230
01:41:11,117 --> 01:41:14,649
What are you doing here? BAKER’S FATHER: Son.
- I don’t want to talk to you.

1231
01:41:14,777 --> 01:41:16,737
It’s because of you all of
this happened. Go away!

1232
01:41:16,931 --> 01:41:19,405
I’m sorry. I did a foolish thing.
- Why would you do that?

1233
01:41:19,431 --> 01:41:20,965
Why did you take
the Witch’s beans?

1234
01:41:21,061 --> 01:41:23,649
They were there and I wanted them. I didn’t think.
I was being careless...

1235
01:41:23,769 --> 01:41:25,159
...Selfish.
-Yes.

1236
01:41:25,279 --> 01:41:28,363
You stole them and you were caught, and then
you did what you do. You just ran away.

1237
01:41:28,504 --> 01:41:33,321
When your mother died, I was...

1238
01:41:33,435 --> 01:41:37,782
I hated myself
and I ran from my guilt

1239
01:41:37,910 --> 01:41:39,624
and my shame...
- ... and your son.

1240
01:41:42,306 --> 01:41:44,861
Yes, and my son. And I’m sorry for that.
- Then what do you want?

1241
01:41:44,997 --> 01:41:48,305
Aren’t you making the same mistake?
Aren’t you running away?

1242
01:41:49,748 --> 01:41:54,377
Be better than me, son.

1243
01:41:57,289 --> 01:42:00,425
Do better...

1244
01:42:38,752 --> 01:42:41,716
(PLANNING)

1245
01:42:42,025 --> 01:42:43,957
If there were just some way we could
surprise the Giant.

1246
01:42:44,093 --> 01:42:45,225
She’s too tall to surprise.

1247
01:42:45,352 --> 01:42:49,087
ÓæÝ Ãßæä ÎáÝß åäÇ ÓÊÃÊí ãä åäÇ

1248
01:42:50,967 --> 01:42:52,797
I knew you wouldn’t give up.

1249
01:42:52,942 --> 01:42:56,498
He wouldn’t leave his baby.
- It looked like he was going to.

1250
01:42:58,331 --> 01:43:01,019
Give me my son.

1251
01:43:01,139 --> 01:43:02,484
Hey, hey.

1252
01:43:03,778 --> 01:43:04,979
(BABY CRYING)

1253
01:43:09,632 --> 01:43:14,230
What are we going to do now? -We need to
rid this kingdom of the Giant... together.

1254
01:43:14,851 --> 01:43:17,276
She’ll be back soon; here’s the plan.

1255
01:43:17,404 --> 01:43:19,599
We’re going to feed Jack to the Giant.

1256
01:43:19,718 --> 01:43:25,693
We’re going to use you as bait to
lure the Giant towards the tar pit.

1257
01:43:25,827 --> 01:43:30,023
The birds can help! -Oh good friends
we need your help more than ever.

1258
01:43:31,870 --> 01:43:33,675
What of the prince?

1259
01:43:35,887 --> 01:43:39,845
That doesn’t matter now! What’s important
is that we find a way to defeat the Giant.

1260
01:43:41,874 --> 01:43:42,869
Oh yes,

1261
01:43:43,529 --> 01:43:45,941
thank you birds.

1262
01:43:46,044 --> 01:43:49,914
You can talk to birds?
- The birds will do their part.

1263
01:43:50,035 --> 01:43:51,865
Okay, we don’t have much time.

1264
01:43:51,977 --> 01:43:55,486
- I’m excited.
- First, we need a weapon.

1265
01:44:03,595 --> 01:44:07,557
Your father’s being very brave.
We’re going to be very brave too.

1266
01:44:07,693 --> 01:44:10,255
Are you alright, miss?

1267
01:44:11,360 --> 01:44:13,732
The Giant went in that direction.

1268
01:44:14,607 --> 01:44:16,428
My darling!

1269
01:44:17,171 --> 01:44:18,701
My darling!

1270
01:44:18,849 --> 01:44:21,701
I did not recognize you. What are you
doing here?

1271
01:44:23,730 --> 01:44:26,221
And with a child?

1272
01:44:26,333 --> 01:44:28,319
You must go back to the
castle at once. There’s

1273
01:44:28,345 --> 01:44:30,288
a giant on the loose.
- I’m well aware of that.

1274
01:44:30,898 --> 01:44:33,343
My love. What is it?

1275
01:44:34,367 --> 01:44:38,622
Maybe I’m not your only love.
- I love you. Truly I do.

1276
01:44:38,758 --> 01:44:42,591
If you love me, why did you stray?

1277
01:44:45,281 --> 01:44:50,770
I thought if you were mine, that
I would never wish for more.

1278
01:44:53,674 --> 01:44:57,411
If this is how you behave as a prince,
what kind of king will you be?

1279
01:44:57,555 --> 01:45:00,912
I was raised to be
charming, not sincere.

1280
01:45:02,365 --> 01:45:07,301
I think you should go.
- Is that what you really wish?

1281
01:45:09,328 --> 01:45:13,041
My father’s house was a nightmare.
Your house was a dream.

1282
01:45:15,073 --> 01:45:19,361
Now I want something in-between.

1283
01:45:32,075 --> 01:45:36,931
I shall always love the
maiden who ran away.

1284
01:45:37,063 --> 01:45:41,544
And I the faraway prince.

1285
01:45:53,139 --> 01:45:55,559
Careful, there. Not so fast.
- Don't worry

1286
01:45:55,687 --> 01:45:58,208
...this is easier
than a beanstalk.

1287
01:45:58,322 --> 01:46:02,459
They’re in the tree... over -We
made slings out of my cape.

1288
01:46:05,784 --> 01:46:10,357
I wanted to climb a tree too.
- I’m glad you’re here to help me.

1289
01:46:15,921 --> 01:46:17,501
What’s wrong?

1290
01:46:19,053 --> 01:46:22,343
I think my mother and my
Granny would be upset with me.

1291
01:46:24,448 --> 01:46:25,798
Why?

1292
01:46:25,903 --> 01:46:31,334
They said always to make them proud
and here I am about to kill somebody.

1293
01:46:33,472 --> 01:46:35,488
Not somebody.

1294
01:46:35,591 --> 01:46:39,545
A giant who’s done a lot of harm.
- But a giant’s a person.

1295
01:46:41,137 --> 01:46:45,896
Aren’t we to show forgiveness?

1296
01:46:46,847 --> 01:46:50,954
MOTHER CANNOT GUIDE YOU.

1297
01:46:51,098 --> 01:46:54,625
NOW YOU’RE ON YOUR OWN

1298
01:46:54,746 --> 01:46:58,049
ONLY ME BESIDE YOU.

1299
01:46:58,191 --> 01:47:02,626
STILL, YOU’RE NOT ALONE.

1300
01:47:02,746 --> 01:47:10,034
NO ONE IS ALONE, TRULY.
NO ONE IS ALONE.

1301
01:47:10,194 --> 01:47:12,209
I WISH...

1302
01:47:12,362 --> 01:47:14,225
I know.

1303
01:47:15,307 --> 01:47:17,576
Wait until my mother hears I’ve slain
the Giant.

1304
01:47:17,712 --> 01:47:19,168
Jack!

1305
01:47:19,304 --> 01:47:21,072
Jack, there’s something you have to know.

1306
01:47:21,215 --> 01:47:23,763
It's about your mother.
- What?

1307
01:47:27,977 --> 01:47:30,293
She didn’t make it.

1308
01:47:32,643 --> 01:47:36,676
Was she killed by the Giant? -No. It
wasn’t like that. She was fighting

1309
01:47:36,813 --> 01:47:40,856
with the Giant, trying
to protect you, and she

1310
01:47:40,882 --> 01:47:44,838
was pushed by the Steward
... And... she fell.

1311
01:47:45,778 --> 01:47:47,147
The Steward will pay for this.
- No, Jack!

1312
01:47:47,267 --> 01:47:49,351
After we slay the
Giant, I will slay him.

1313
01:47:49,470 --> 01:47:54,717
You’ll do nothing of the kind. -What he
done was wrong. He should be punished.

1314
01:47:55,493 --> 01:47:59,213
It’s not as easy as that.

1315
01:48:00,412 --> 01:48:05,224
MOTHER ISN’T HERE NOW.
- WRONG THINGS, RIGHT THINGS...

1316
01:48:05,336 --> 01:48:08,878
WHO KNOWS WHAT SHE’D SAY?
- WHO CAN SAY WHAT’S TRUE?

1317
01:48:09,013 --> 01:48:12,432
NOTHING’S QUITE SO CLEAR NOW.
- DO THINGS, FIGHT THINGS...

1318
01:48:12,552 --> 01:48:18,575
FEEL YOU’VE LOST YOUR WAY? -YOU
DECIDE, BUT YOU ARE NOT ALONE.

1319
01:48:18,726 --> 01:48:22,578
BELIEVE ME. NO ONE IS ALONE.

1320
01:48:22,700 --> 01:48:25,487
BELIEVE ME.
- TRULY...

1321
01:48:25,616 --> 01:48:29,524
PEOPLE MAKE MISTAKES.
- FATHERS, MOTHERS,

1322
01:48:29,660 --> 01:48:32,108
PEOPLE MAKE MISTAKES

1323
01:48:32,252 --> 01:48:39,246
HOLDING TO THEIR OWN,
THINKING THEY’RE ALONE.

1324
01:48:40,510 --> 01:48:43,158
HONOR THEIR MISTAKES.
FIGHT FOR THEIR MISTAKES...

1325
01:48:43,270 --> 01:48:46,862
EVERYBODY MAKES...... ONE
ANOTHER’S TERRIBLE MISTAKES.

1326
01:48:48,207 --> 01:48:51,932
WITCHES CAN BE RIGHT, GIANTS CAN BE GOOD.

1327
01:48:52,091 --> 01:48:56,426
YOU DECIDE WHAT’S RIGHT,
YOU DECIDE WHAT’S GOOD.

1328
01:48:56,561 --> 01:49:00,770
JUST REMEMBER:

1329
01:49:01,800 --> 01:49:04,969
SOMEONE IS ON YOUR SIDE.

1330
01:49:04,970 --> 01:49:08,348
OUR SIDE. OUR SIDE. SOMEONE ELSE IS NOT.

1331
01:49:10,213 --> 01:49:13,313
WHILE WE’RE SEEING OUR SIDE...

1332
01:49:13,444 --> 01:49:16,553
MAYBE WE FORGOT:

1333
01:49:16,681 --> 01:49:20,370
THEY ARE NOT ALONE

1334
01:49:21,394 --> 01:49:24,778
NO ONE IS ALONE

1335
01:49:26,016 --> 01:49:34,016
SOMEONE IS ON YOUR SIDE... NO ONE IS
ALONE...

1336
01:49:39,487 --> 01:49:41,831
Go, Jack!

1337
01:49:41,951 --> 01:49:43,703
Be careful.

1338
01:49:45,552 --> 01:49:48,221
Here she comes!

1339
01:50:10,160 --> 01:50:13,281
- Wher is the boy?
- We have him.

1340
01:50:13,592 --> 01:50:15,592
- Where?
- He’s hiding in that tree!

1341
01:50:18,496 --> 01:50:22,135
Here I am!

1342
01:50:39,475 --> 01:50:41,348
You ready?
- Ready!

1343
01:51:01,142 --> 01:51:03,363
Good birds!
- She doesn’t look happy.

1344
01:51:13,592 --> 01:51:17,287
Look out Jack!
- Jack!

1345
01:51:18,238 --> 01:51:19,548
Jack!

1346
01:52:07,072 --> 01:52:10,186
Jack!
- Where are they? -Jack!

1347
01:52:11,235 --> 01:52:13,525
Jack? Mr. Baker?

1348
01:52:15,315 --> 01:52:16,795
Jack? Over here!

1349
01:52:16,915 --> 01:52:18,687
Jack!

1350
01:52:20,012 --> 01:52:21,435
Oh, be careful,

1351
01:52:22,322 --> 01:52:24,478
Are you alright?

1352
01:52:26,064 --> 01:52:27,789
- Where is he?
- He’s not with you?

1353
01:52:27,905 --> 01:52:28,950
- Jack!
- Mr. Baker?

1354
01:52:29,089 --> 01:52:30,273
Jack!

1355
01:52:31,865 --> 01:52:33,145
Help me.

1356
01:52:33,272 --> 01:52:36,345
Jack, I’m here.

1357
01:52:45,274 --> 01:52:47,237
Are you alright?

1358
01:52:47,357 --> 01:52:49,254
Are you okay?

1359
01:52:49,907 --> 01:52:51,696
Are you alright?

1360
01:52:51,826 --> 01:52:53,473
Yeah. Yeah.

1361
01:52:53,601 --> 01:52:56,904
We did it! We did it! Come here.

1362
01:53:06,475 --> 01:53:09,445
Now we can all return home.
- What home?

1363
01:53:09,573 --> 01:53:13,033
I have no one to take care of me.
And we have nowhere to go

1364
01:53:13,209 --> 01:53:17,020
so we’ll move in with you.
- Well...

1365
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:20,331
Of course

1366
01:53:20,451 --> 01:53:23,565
Of course. You can come home with me.
- And you can come, too.

1367
01:53:23,708 --> 01:53:26,372
If you want to. I’ll gladly
help you with your house.

1368
01:53:26,398 --> 01:53:28,765
There are times when I
actually enjoy cleaning.

1369
01:53:31,725 --> 01:53:34,372
Here... give him to me.

1370
01:53:40,086 --> 01:53:41,927
Sssh!

1371
01:53:46,467 --> 01:53:48,723
Sssh!

1372
01:53:49,864 --> 01:53:53,484
I know you miss your mother.

1373
01:53:53,596 --> 01:53:57,307
-I miss her too.

1374
01:53:59,783 --> 01:54:02,855
MAYBE I JUST WASN’T MEANT TO
HAVE CHILDREN... DON’T SAY THAT!

1375
01:54:02,881 --> 01:54:05,082
OF COURSE YOU WERE MEANT
TO HAVE CHILDREN.

1376
01:54:05,177 --> 01:54:09,174
BUT HOW CAN I GO ABOUT BEING A FATHER
WHEN I HAD NO FATHER TO SHOW ME?

1377
01:54:09,721 --> 01:54:13,043
-JUST CALM THE CHILD. -YES, CALM THE CHILD.

1378
01:54:14,216 --> 01:54:17,236
LOOK, TELL HIM THE STORY OF HOW
IT ALL HAPPENED. BE FATHER

1379
01:54:17,262 --> 01:54:20,096
AND MOTHER,
YOU’LL KNOW WHAT TO DO.

1380
01:54:21,145 --> 01:54:21,721
Alone.

1381
01:54:25,012 --> 01:54:27,953
SOMETIMES PEOPLE LEAVE YOU

1382
01:54:29,621 --> 01:54:33,165
HALFWAY THROUGH THE WOOD.

1383
01:54:33,867 --> 01:54:37,215
DO NOT LET IT GRIEVE YOU

1384
01:54:38,205 --> 01:54:44,672
NO ONE LEAVES FOR GOOD
YOU ARE NOT ALONE

1385
01:54:45,786 --> 01:54:48,976
NO ONE IS ALONE

1386
01:54:51,541 --> 01:54:59,541
HOLD HIM TO THE LIGHT NOW.
LET HIM SEE THE GLOW.

1387
01:55:01,308 --> 01:55:04,645
THINGS WILL BE ALL
RIGHT NOW

1388
01:55:04,764 --> 01:55:08,044
TELL HIM WHAT YOU KNOW...

1389
01:55:15,138 --> 01:55:18,238
Once upon a time... in a far
off kingdom...

1390
01:55:18,358 --> 01:55:22,606
there lay a small village CAREFUL THE
THINGS YOU SAY at the edge of the woods...

1391
01:55:22,750 --> 01:55:27,841
And in this village lived a young maiden...
CHILDREN WILL LISTEN.

1392
01:55:28,580 --> 01:55:33,592
A carefree young lad... and a childless baker...
CAREFUL THE THINGS YOU DO

1393
01:55:37,062 --> 01:55:38,566
with his wife.

1394
01:55:40,990 --> 01:55:47,078
And one day, the baker and his wife were in their shop when
a witch GUIDE THEM ALONG THE WAY CHILDREN WILL GLISTEN.

1395
01:55:47,222 --> 01:55:54,278
Burst in, blowing the door off its hinges...
CHILDREN WILL LOOK TO YOU FOR WHICH WAY TO TURN

1396
01:55:54,446 --> 01:55:58,487
TO LEARN WHAT TO BE.

1397
01:55:58,647 --> 01:56:04,528
CAREFUL BEFORE YOU
SAY “LISTEN TO ME.”

1398
01:56:05,393 --> 01:56:09,170
CHILDREN WILL LISTEN.

1399
01:56:09,531 --> 01:56:12,972
CAREFUL THE WISH YOU MAKE

1400
01:56:12,973 --> 01:56:19,490
WISHES ARE CHILDREN.CAREFUL
THE PATH THEY TAKE...

1401
01:56:19,610 --> 01:56:23,308
WISHES COME TRUE,

1402
01:56:23,333 --> 01:56:25,641
NOT FREE.
