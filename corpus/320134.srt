1
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,305
I can't believe you talked me into this.

2
00:02:29,382 --> 00:02:31,509
Now, you're sure,
like, all our gear...

3
00:02:31,584 --> 00:02:32,778
And everything's on the boat?

4
00:02:32,852 --> 00:02:34,149
Relax. I've taken
care of everything...

5
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:35,312
All right?

6
00:02:35,388 --> 00:02:37,549
I know, I know,
I'm sure it'll be good.

7
00:02:37,624 --> 00:02:39,091
You're not gonna see
any of these guys...

8
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,148
Don't worry about it.

9
00:02:40,226 --> 00:02:41,523
This is as close as
you're gonna get.

10
00:02:41,594 --> 00:02:43,562
I'll take your word for it.

11
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:44,892
Take my word for it.

12
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:57,639
This is my worst nightmare,
you know that?

13
00:02:59,078 --> 00:03:01,638
I mean, what part,
are you nervous?

14
00:03:01,714 --> 00:03:03,204
No. No,
I'm not nervous.

15
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:04,807
Oh, that's it.

16
00:03:04,884 --> 00:03:06,408
Nervous about spending
the night with Ashley...

17
00:03:06,486 --> 00:03:07,453
Would you shut up?

18
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,512
Well, look, you're
the college athlete, but...

19
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,057
You're afraid of a girl.

20
00:03:13,993 --> 00:03:15,426
Shut up.

21
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:16,860
Or you're swimming
with the fishies.

22
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:18,261
Yeah, I'm
really scared.

23
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:21,159
Well, you should be.

24
00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:22,758
You know, I get it.

25
00:03:22,835 --> 00:03:25,963
This isn't just a girl.
This is a babe.

26
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:28,906
This is an Irish babe.

27
00:03:28,975 --> 00:03:30,840
And did I mention rich?

28
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:32,070
Really rich?

29
00:03:32,145 --> 00:03:34,375
Heir to the McDougal
Industries rich?

30
00:03:34,447 --> 00:03:36,347
Are you through?

31
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:38,816
No, I also hear that she's bad.

32
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:41,251
She's really, really bad!

33
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:43,152
Very bad.

34
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:44,713
Lance! No, dude, no.

35
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:46,019
Look, I'm not gonna put
you wrong here,

36
00:03:46,092 --> 00:03:47,081
I'm not putting you wrong.

37
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,025
These are the glory days.

38
00:03:49,095 --> 00:03:51,586
Yeah, you keep telling me that.

39
00:03:51,664 --> 00:03:53,564
So, there's nothing to worry about.

40
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:54,622
Is there?

41
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:56,032
Which one is it?

42
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:58,396
Hey!

43
00:03:58,471 --> 00:03:59,995
Hey!

44
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:02,303
How you doin'?

45
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:04,536
You know, yeah.

46
00:04:04,611 --> 00:04:05,578
What you got
down there?

47
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:07,340
Uh, we got my room down here.

48
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:09,506
Really? I thought there were
only 3 rooms on this boat.

49
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:10,947
Well, there were originally,

50
00:04:11,017 --> 00:04:13,679
But, this is kind of
a secret compartment,

51
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:14,777
Made it my own.

52
00:04:14,854 --> 00:04:16,583
- Secret.
- Yeah.

53
00:04:16,656 --> 00:04:18,920
- Hey, baby!
- Hey!

54
00:04:20,059 --> 00:04:21,924
Hi, I'm Lance.

55
00:04:21,995 --> 00:04:23,360
Hey, Ashley.

56
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:24,555
Nice to meet you.

57
00:04:24,631 --> 00:04:25,689
You, too.

58
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:28,165
You're not gonna
kiss me, are you?

59
00:04:28,234 --> 00:04:29,826
I suppose that'd kill you. No.

60
00:04:29,902 --> 00:04:30,834
Good answer.

61
00:04:30,903 --> 00:04:31,927
Thanks.

62
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:33,939
Hmm, you two, let's go
meet the captain.

63
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:36,703
Oh, my God,
you gotta be kidding me.

64
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:38,710
This is not what we paid for.

65
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:40,439
Nice boat.

66
00:04:40,513 --> 00:04:43,914
Yeah, it looks a little different
than in the brochure.

67
00:04:43,983 --> 00:04:45,007
You think?

68
00:04:45,084 --> 00:04:47,143
<i>Well, welcome to
my boat, the Interficio.</i>

69
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,244
It's a great day for sailing.

70
00:04:48,321 --> 00:04:49,413
Glad you all could make it here.

71
00:04:49,489 --> 00:04:51,013
You must be Kate.

72
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:52,022
Ashley.

73
00:04:52,091 --> 00:04:53,524
Ashley, nice to meet you.

74
00:04:53,593 --> 00:04:54,560
And you must be?

75
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:56,561
- Ashley.
- What?

76
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:59,063
Just kidding! I'm Kate.

77
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:00,497
Nice to meet you.

78
00:05:00,566 --> 00:05:01,658
Nice to meet you, Kate.

79
00:05:01,734 --> 00:05:03,099
And you guys, who are you?

80
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:06,298
So, I'm Tom, and this is Lance.

81
00:05:06,372 --> 00:05:07,361
Hey, how are you?

82
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,738
Nice to meet you. I'm the captain.
You can call me Captain.

83
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:11,333
Do you take a check?

84
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:13,003
For the humor, yeah,
for the vacation, no.

85
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:14,910
Yeah, I tried that.
But paying for it...

86
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:16,915
with a check doesn't work.

87
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:20,817
Ok, um. And you are?

88
00:05:20,887 --> 00:05:22,115
Oh, I'm Derek.

89
00:05:22,188 --> 00:05:23,815
- Derek?
- Yeah.

90
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:25,653
Do you work on the boat?

91
00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:27,386
No, he's a passenger, hop on.

92
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:29,655
Oh, wait a minute, time out.

93
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:32,197
Derek, don't hop on board.
Could you just...

94
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:33,459
Could you get off, 'cause...

95
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:36,024
Captain, no disrespect...

96
00:05:36,102 --> 00:05:38,502
But, um...
Actually, a little disrespect.

97
00:05:38,571 --> 00:05:39,697
We just paid good money
for it to be...

98
00:05:39,772 --> 00:05:40,932
four people
on the boat, remember?

99
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:42,907
Uh, yeah, we do
have a problem then...

100
00:05:42,975 --> 00:05:45,500
because the captain
does like to navigate.

101
00:05:45,578 --> 00:05:47,170
Seriously, though,
I wasn't aware...

102
00:05:47,246 --> 00:05:49,271
anyone else was going
to be aboard, captain.

103
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:50,441
Who are you?

104
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:52,484
I'm Joel, the navigator
and first mate.

105
00:05:52,552 --> 00:05:54,019
Where's the second mate?

106
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:56,954
Power struggle, thrown overboard.
I won.

107
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,490
Comforting.

108
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,327
What time do we
shove off, Captain?

109
00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:04,056
Five minutes.
Disconnect the shore power line.

110
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:05,062
- Thank you, Captain.
- You bet.

111
00:06:05,131 --> 00:06:07,156
Who are all you people?

112
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:10,134
Now I know this was a bad idea.

113
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:11,864
Hey, Captain, where are
we all going to sleep?

114
00:06:11,938 --> 00:06:13,963
Hey, Derek, why do you care?
You're not staying.

115
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,064
Oh, yes, I am.

116
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:16,165
No, you're not.

117
00:06:16,242 --> 00:06:17,937
- Yes, I am.
- No, you're not.

118
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:19,375
Oh, God.
Come on, boys, cut it out.

119
00:06:19,445 --> 00:06:21,003
You bunk down at
the end of the hall.

120
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,945
Last door.

121
00:06:23,015 --> 00:06:24,642
I actually worked to
pay for this cruise.

122
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:25,843
I don't care.

123
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:27,909
Hey, look, guys, we
don't want any problems.

124
00:06:27,987 --> 00:06:29,887
- All right.
- Right. No problem!

125
00:06:29,956 --> 00:06:31,287
Whatever!

126
00:06:31,357 --> 00:06:32,949
Ash...

127
00:06:33,025 --> 00:06:34,424
Let's go see what
we're paying for.

128
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:35,756
- Come on.
- Kate...

129
00:06:35,828 --> 00:06:37,352
- Come on! Let's see it.
- Kate!

130
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:01,448
Well, I guess there's
only two rooms left...

131
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:02,749
So it looks like...

132
00:07:02,822 --> 00:07:04,414
Girls on one side,
boys on the other.

133
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:05,821
Traditional.

134
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:08,060
Kate.

135
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:12,587
Hey, where do you
think Joel sleeps?

136
00:07:12,665 --> 00:07:14,724
I don't know.

137
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:16,962
Where do you think
Derek's gonna sleep?

138
00:07:17,036 --> 00:07:19,027
Ooh, good answer.

139
00:07:22,975 --> 00:07:25,876
Come on. Let's check out our room.

140
00:07:29,315 --> 00:07:32,284
So, Captain, you ever catch
any big fish out of this boat?

141
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:34,285
- You bet. Big'uns.
- Yeah?

142
00:07:34,353 --> 00:07:35,547
It's all about the bait.

143
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:40,850
Captain.

144
00:07:40,927 --> 00:07:42,918
Welcome aboard.

145
00:07:42,995 --> 00:07:44,860
Everything's gonna be cool.

146
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:47,399
No problems, OK?

147
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,594
All right. No problems, whatever.

148
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:58,535
Who does that
captain think he was?

149
00:07:58,611 --> 00:08:01,102
Oh, I don't know. The captain?

150
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,408
Don't cross me, Lance.

151
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,541
Where did that come from?
"Don't cross you"?

152
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:06,983
May I remind you this is
all your brilliant idea?

153
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:08,486
And who says cross anymore?

154
00:08:12,191 --> 00:08:13,556
Shut up.

155
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:14,650
Yeah.

156
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:21,826
I must be in the wrong room.

157
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:23,163
Yeah, you got that right.

158
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:27,870
Actually, no, wait.

159
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,498
Why don't you stay,
please, and I'll leave.

160
00:08:29,575 --> 00:08:30,667
And actually,
do you need a roommate...

161
00:08:30,743 --> 00:08:31,835
back on the mainland?

162
00:08:31,911 --> 00:08:33,344
Look, I'm sorry, we're
having a little bit...

163
00:08:33,412 --> 00:08:34,640
of a miscommunication here.

164
00:08:34,714 --> 00:08:36,147
Which is ironic,
because his girlfriend...

165
00:08:36,215 --> 00:08:38,809
The Education major,
she's been working with him.

166
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:40,182
Yeah, that's it. Come here.

167
00:08:42,922 --> 00:08:45,652
Uh, look, maybe I can...
Find another room.

168
00:08:45,725 --> 00:08:47,488
The girls are right
across the hall.

169
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,585
You two keep this room.

170
00:08:49,662 --> 00:08:50,754
Yeah, all right, truce.

171
00:08:52,098 --> 00:08:53,463
- What?
- What?

172
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,160
Great, nice job, you dork.

173
00:08:55,234 --> 00:08:56,826
What are they doing out there?

174
00:08:56,903 --> 00:08:59,633
I don't know. Boys will be boys.

175
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:01,002
Why don't you
get them all up on deck?

176
00:09:01,073 --> 00:09:04,201
All hands on deck!
Captain's orders.

177
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:22,552
<i>Informational meeting.
Welcome to the Interficio...</i>

178
00:09:22,628 --> 00:09:25,062
You're about to embark on
the trip of a lifetime.

179
00:09:25,131 --> 00:09:27,691
We're gonna go to
the best diving and fishing...

180
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:28,995
and partying spots.

181
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:31,730
Tonight, we're going to
a place called Pirate Island.

182
00:09:31,804 --> 00:09:34,238
Life jackets, first aid
equipment stored overhead...

183
00:09:34,307 --> 00:09:36,275
in the compartment.

184
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:38,276
Lf, for any reason,
we start taking on water...

185
00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:40,141
All seats become
a flotation device, right?

186
00:09:40,212 --> 00:09:42,772
No, you drown.

187
00:09:43,983 --> 00:09:46,178
OK, get ready to set sail.

188
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:47,617
OK.

189
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:50,349
Gentlemen and ladies,
the bar is open.

190
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:51,754
Whoo! Let's go.

191
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:28,009
Now, we're gonna be on
Pirate Island tonight...

192
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,548
and I'll be using the dinghy
to ferry everybody back and forth.

193
00:12:30,616 --> 00:12:32,049
I can only take two at a time.

194
00:12:52,738 --> 00:12:53,670
Here you go, babe.

195
00:12:53,739 --> 00:12:54,763
Oh, thank you.

196
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,034
So...

197
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:58,736
is this where we sit around...

198
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:00,938
and tell horror stories
by the campfire?

199
00:13:02,381 --> 00:13:05,407
Captain, why do they
call this Pirate Island?

200
00:13:05,484 --> 00:13:07,816
I don't know. Pirates?

201
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:18,890
# I barely had hair
and I killed only three #

202
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:22,297
# Filigo, filigo, filigo-ree #

203
00:13:22,368 --> 00:13:25,462
# But old Mr. Teach
took a liking to me #

204
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:29,372
# Filigo, filigo, filigo-ree #

205
00:13:29,441 --> 00:13:32,410
# The first day out,
he gunpowdered my rum #

206
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:35,379
# Filigo, filigo, filigo-rum #

207
00:13:35,447 --> 00:13:39,042
# Me timbers did shiver,
me head, it did hum #

208
00:13:39,118 --> 00:13:43,111
# Filigo, filigo, filigo-rum #

209
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:46,818
# He taught me to kill
while feeling much glee #

210
00:13:46,892 --> 00:13:51,727
# Filigo... ho ho!
Filigo, filigo-ree #

211
00:13:51,797 --> 00:13:55,255
# A man can say little once he's dead #

212
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:58,428
# Filigo, filigo, filigo-red #

213
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:04,067
# As we walk hand in hand
with Mr. Death on the beach #

214
00:14:04,143 --> 00:14:07,738
# "Forever the Black Jack!"
Cries old Mr. Teach #

215
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,375
Now you are really scaring me.

216
00:14:14,887 --> 00:14:17,378
It's just an old pirate's tale, Ash.

217
00:14:17,456 --> 00:14:19,321
True pirate, he sings it
just before or after...

218
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:21,188
he kills somebody.

219
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:24,161
Basically, it means...

220
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:25,322
you're next.

221
00:14:25,397 --> 00:14:27,991
Well, now we know why
there's no more old pirates, huh?

222
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:30,467
The songs killed 'em.

223
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:31,901
Actually, there are.

224
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:34,406
Oh, please.

225
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,702
No, really.

226
00:14:37,776 --> 00:14:39,676
There are renegade bandits
that consider themselves...

227
00:14:39,745 --> 00:14:41,337
modern-day pirates.

228
00:14:41,413 --> 00:14:43,938
They kill, steal.

229
00:14:44,016 --> 00:14:46,746
They prey on boats
throughout these waters.

230
00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:48,411
And we're dead in the center.

231
00:14:49,521 --> 00:14:51,386
Pirate's alley.

232
00:14:51,457 --> 00:14:52,890
Are you serious?

233
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:55,188
Some even dress up
and fly the Black Jack.

234
00:14:55,261 --> 00:14:56,660
Black Jack?

235
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,219
Skull and crossbones.

236
00:15:01,767 --> 00:15:02,893
Modern pirates?

237
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:05,594
Captain?

238
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:07,366
It's true.

239
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:11,202
And...

240
00:15:11,277 --> 00:15:12,710
We're camped on their island.

241
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:16,780
You're all nuts.

242
00:15:16,849 --> 00:15:18,908
Yeah.

243
00:15:18,984 --> 00:15:21,418
New game, new rules.

244
00:15:24,323 --> 00:15:26,985
What are you scared of?

245
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:30,028
What are you really scared of?

246
00:15:32,197 --> 00:15:35,098
OK.

247
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:36,099
Death.

248
00:15:36,168 --> 00:15:38,102
Death by...

249
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:41,799
Murder.

250
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:44,374
Next.

251
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:52,440
Throat cut.

252
00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:54,383
Gruesome...

253
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:55,579
but I like it.

254
00:15:57,022 --> 00:15:58,751
Ok, Gruesome. You're next.

255
00:16:01,727 --> 00:16:05,254
My, uh, big fear is...

256
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:06,457
drowning.

257
00:16:08,233 --> 00:16:09,632
What a dork.

258
00:16:11,236 --> 00:16:12,362
OK, Hotshot.

259
00:16:12,438 --> 00:16:14,838
I'm the director of this play.

260
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:16,067
You're next.

261
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:21,010
Oh, that's easy.
Nothing scares me.

262
00:16:22,514 --> 00:16:24,448
Come on, Tom.

263
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,778
OK...

264
00:16:31,423 --> 00:16:33,823
Suffocation.

265
00:16:33,892 --> 00:16:35,621
Lack of O2.

266
00:16:35,694 --> 00:16:37,525
Captain?

267
00:16:39,431 --> 00:16:42,923
What scares me...

268
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,264
I know it's weird,
because I'm a sailor...

269
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:46,964
but... hooks. Hooks.

270
00:16:50,542 --> 00:16:51,873
Next?

271
00:16:51,944 --> 00:16:53,206
As you know by now...

272
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:56,839
I'm the navigator and first mate.

273
00:16:56,915 --> 00:16:58,644
I love the sea...

274
00:16:58,717 --> 00:17:01,777
though I have to say
I am in awe of it.

275
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:04,288
What scares me...

276
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:06,415
Being lost in it.

277
00:17:06,492 --> 00:17:08,551
That's why I'm the navigator.

278
00:17:08,627 --> 00:17:09,821
Next.

279
00:17:09,895 --> 00:17:11,021
Oh, well, I guess that leaves me.

280
00:17:11,096 --> 00:17:15,089
I love the water. I always have.

281
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:19,103
The only thing that's
ever really scared me is sharks.

282
00:17:19,638 --> 00:17:23,540
I was a kid,
and I was out fishing...

283
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:25,406
and I had this
little fish on the line...

284
00:17:25,477 --> 00:17:27,308
and he's thrashing
all around, and...

285
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:31,179
Then I see it.
This fin pops up.

286
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:33,309
And he's headed
straight for my fish...

287
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:36,354
and I was helpless to do
anything about it.

288
00:17:36,422 --> 00:17:38,083
Anyway, from now on out...

289
00:17:38,157 --> 00:17:39,852
I keep this shark
on my rear view mirror...

290
00:17:39,925 --> 00:17:41,688
to remind me to face my fears.

291
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,751
That's a sad story.

292
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:45,091
Lance?

293
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:47,257
Your turn.
We need more beer.

294
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:50,558
OK.

295
00:18:02,448 --> 00:18:03,915
You OK?

296
00:18:03,982 --> 00:18:05,779
No.

297
00:18:08,954 --> 00:18:10,080
Lance?

298
00:18:10,155 --> 00:18:11,417
Hey, you're bleeding.

299
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:12,422
What did you do?

300
00:18:12,491 --> 00:18:13,423
Yeah.

301
00:18:13,492 --> 00:18:14,424
Oh, shoot!

302
00:18:14,493 --> 00:18:15,425
I stepped on something.

303
00:18:15,494 --> 00:18:16,552
Come over here.

304
00:18:16,628 --> 00:18:18,027
Careful.

305
00:18:20,699 --> 00:18:21,893
What was it?

306
00:18:21,967 --> 00:18:24,197
Here, take a seat.
Let's have a look.

307
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:25,258
Easy...

308
00:18:25,337 --> 00:18:26,736
Oh...

309
00:18:26,805 --> 00:18:27,772
God, that hurts.

310
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,068
Oh, man!

311
00:18:29,141 --> 00:18:30,403
Oh, God, what did you step on?

312
00:18:30,476 --> 00:18:32,535
What happened?

313
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:35,239
I don't know, man.
I stepped on something.

314
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:38,010
Oh, that looks bad.

315
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:39,345
Pour some rum on it.

316
00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:40,976
I can't believe this.

317
00:18:42,054 --> 00:18:43,021
That's enough.

318
00:18:43,088 --> 00:18:44,851
Sorry! Sorry, sorry, sorry.

319
00:18:44,923 --> 00:18:45,855
Oh, God.

320
00:18:45,924 --> 00:18:48,415
I think that might
need stitches, man.

321
00:18:48,494 --> 00:18:51,156
No, I don't think so. It'll be OK.

322
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:52,754
Just keep it wrapped
and apply pressure.

323
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:55,493
Did you see how deep that was?

324
00:18:55,567 --> 00:18:57,262
I mean, that was really deep.

325
00:18:57,336 --> 00:18:59,531
Wonder what in the world
he cut himself on.

326
00:18:59,605 --> 00:19:00,537
It's not like a shell...

327
00:19:00,606 --> 00:19:01,538
Is he ok?

328
00:19:01,607 --> 00:19:03,438
No. Y'all, we should go.

329
00:19:06,445 --> 00:19:08,072
'Cause it hurts.

330
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:14,246
We should go.
Everybody, come on. Let's go.

331
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:15,877
What did I step...
What the hell did I step...

332
00:19:15,954 --> 00:19:17,683
Did I step on?

333
00:19:17,756 --> 00:19:19,383
Well, Lance...

334
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:21,517
You make your friends fast, huh?

335
00:19:21,593 --> 00:19:23,993
Who would leave this like that?

336
00:19:24,062 --> 00:19:25,859
What, you think somebody
did that on purpose?

337
00:19:25,931 --> 00:19:28,263
You have another suggestion?

338
00:19:32,137 --> 00:19:34,332
No.

339
00:19:34,406 --> 00:19:35,498
Good question.

340
00:19:35,574 --> 00:19:36,541
Let's get him back to the boat.

341
00:19:36,608 --> 00:19:39,076
I'll get the first aid kit.

342
00:19:39,144 --> 00:19:40,634
Bring the dinghy.

343
00:19:40,712 --> 00:19:42,373
So it begins.

344
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:51,312
We could turn back.

345
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:54,223
Nah, kids want to go on.

346
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:58,087
You should have told me
about Derek.

347
00:20:02,267 --> 00:20:04,565
I needed the money.

348
00:20:04,636 --> 00:20:06,228
Besides, I am the captain.

349
00:20:06,305 --> 00:20:08,364
Then act like one.

350
00:20:21,286 --> 00:20:23,311
We got a bleeder here.

351
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:25,618
That feel any better?

352
00:20:25,691 --> 00:20:26,988
Yeah. Yeah, that's good, man.

353
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:29,584
Do you want to use my cell phone?

354
00:20:29,661 --> 00:20:31,993
No, no, I mean,
I think I'm gonna be OK.

355
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:33,156
I mean, you're sure
you don't want...

356
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,894
to go back to shore for help,
or call, or something?

357
00:20:35,968 --> 00:20:38,198
No. You know, it seems
to have stopped bleeding...

358
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:39,669
and we're all on vacation, so...

359
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:42,673
Some vacation.

360
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:44,208
Seriously. I mean,
if we go back to shore...

361
00:20:44,276 --> 00:20:46,301
we can always check and make sure...
our cars are OK...

362
00:20:46,378 --> 00:20:47,470
Ash...

363
00:20:47,546 --> 00:20:48,843
I think it's gonna be ok.

364
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,842
Hey, lovebirds...

365
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:55,716
He just cut his foot, you know?

366
00:20:55,787 --> 00:20:56,754
On a knife.

367
00:20:56,822 --> 00:20:58,449
Yeah, but he's gonna be fine.

368
00:20:58,523 --> 00:21:01,321
Fine? I mean, doesn't he need
a Tetanus shot, or something?

369
00:21:01,393 --> 00:21:02,724
Oh, that's just if the blade was rusty...

370
00:21:02,794 --> 00:21:03,783
but that knife was clean, right?

371
00:21:03,862 --> 00:21:04,954
It was all right.

372
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:06,463
Yeah, but don't you
think that's weird?

373
00:21:06,531 --> 00:21:08,761
A clean blade in the middle of
a deserted island?

374
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:10,426
It was probably
left there by a fisherman.

375
00:21:10,502 --> 00:21:11,491
A fisherman?

376
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:35,286
Guys, this is a little spot
I like to call Snorkel Bay.

377
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:36,719
We're directly above
a series of reefs...

378
00:22:36,788 --> 00:22:38,221
that go down into deep water.

379
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:40,815
You get snagged down there,
nobody's coming after you.

380
00:22:40,892 --> 00:22:42,325
That's reassuring.

381
00:22:43,729 --> 00:22:46,197
You're each gonna get
a snorkel and a mask.

382
00:22:46,264 --> 00:22:48,198
Stay up close to the boat,
but away from the hull,

383
00:22:48,266 --> 00:22:50,063
So the waves don't
crash you up against it.

384
00:22:50,135 --> 00:22:52,831
We don't want another accident,
do we, Lance?

385
00:22:52,904 --> 00:22:53,928
Right.

386
00:22:54,005 --> 00:22:54,994
Right. OK.

387
00:22:55,073 --> 00:22:56,199
So are there sharks down there?

388
00:22:56,274 --> 00:22:57,901
Well, that's a Lance question.

389
00:22:57,976 --> 00:23:00,410
No, well, this is their home,
you know?

390
00:23:00,479 --> 00:23:02,811
As long as we're not leaving a trail
of blood in the water...

391
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:04,542
we should be fine.

392
00:23:04,616 --> 00:23:06,311
Speaking of which,
you still bleeding?

393
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:09,548
No. No, not really.

394
00:23:09,621 --> 00:23:11,885
Maybe you better
sit this one out, anyway.

395
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:15,888
OK.

396
00:23:15,961 --> 00:23:17,929
Everybody into the water.
Have fun.

397
00:23:17,996 --> 00:23:20,396
Stay away from the propeller,
it's an ugly way to die.

398
00:24:21,526 --> 00:24:23,118
Kate, Kate.

399
00:24:23,195 --> 00:24:25,095
I dropped my mask.

400
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:33,064
You find it, I'll make it
worth your while.

401
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:34,127
I'll be right back.

402
00:24:34,206 --> 00:24:36,231
Don't bother.
You heard the captain.

403
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:37,366
It's too deep there.

404
00:24:37,442 --> 00:24:39,569
You're an amateur.

405
00:24:44,516 --> 00:24:46,814
Your boyfriend's gonna
get himself killed.

406
00:24:46,885 --> 00:24:48,375
Boys will be boys.

407
00:24:48,453 --> 00:24:49,385
Yeah.

408
00:24:49,454 --> 00:24:50,421
See ya.

409
00:24:56,595 --> 00:24:59,359
On the edge, man. On the edge.

410
00:24:59,431 --> 00:25:01,296
Over the edge, pal.

411
00:25:01,366 --> 00:25:03,664
What? I didn't see you going in.

412
00:25:03,735 --> 00:25:07,603
No, I didn't want to.
It's just a stupid mask.

413
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:09,503
What's the matter, Derek,
you afraid to drown?

414
00:25:09,574 --> 00:25:11,337
Quite frankly...

415
00:25:11,409 --> 00:25:12,933
Yeah.

416
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:14,308
That's not the point.

417
00:25:14,379 --> 00:25:15,744
What is the point?

418
00:25:15,814 --> 00:25:16,974
Kate!

419
00:25:24,489 --> 00:25:26,821
That was a rush.

420
00:25:26,892 --> 00:25:29,326
I'm your knight
in shining armor, baby.

421
00:25:29,394 --> 00:25:31,692
It's a wonder you didn't
sink to the bottom.

422
00:25:31,763 --> 00:25:34,789
Yeah, I thought hot air rises
though, doesn't it?

423
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:36,834
Hey, you want
to throw me overboard?

424
00:25:36,902 --> 00:25:39,132
That's OK. I'll pass.

425
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:40,831
Is there a problem here, boys?

426
00:25:43,008 --> 00:25:45,203
I'm good.

427
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:07,664
Hey, guys.

428
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:08,756
Hey! How you doing, Lance?

429
00:26:08,833 --> 00:26:09,765
Hey, Lance.

430
00:26:09,834 --> 00:26:10,766
Hey, man, how are you?

431
00:26:10,835 --> 00:26:12,097
You know, good. What's going on?

432
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:14,434
Just getting back to work.

433
00:26:14,506 --> 00:26:16,030
OK.

434
00:26:16,107 --> 00:26:18,871
Good-bye. Yeah, yeah.

435
00:26:18,944 --> 00:26:19,876
Hi.

436
00:26:19,945 --> 00:26:21,037
Hey.

437
00:26:23,715 --> 00:26:25,012
So what was that all about?

438
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:27,643
Oh, nothing. I was just
figuring out some stuff.

439
00:26:27,719 --> 00:26:31,211
My dad likes to know
exactly where I am at all times.

440
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:34,088
Really? That sounds like fun.

441
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:36,719
Yeah. I don't always
like to tell him.

442
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:40,728
Welcome to my world.

443
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:43,267
I'm glad to be here.

444
00:27:03,722 --> 00:27:06,054
So what is this Party Island?

445
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:07,819
You didn't read the brochure?

446
00:27:07,892 --> 00:27:09,484
- There was a brochure?
- Yes.

447
00:27:09,561 --> 00:27:11,825
I mean, besides this boat brochure?

448
00:27:11,896 --> 00:27:13,090
Yeah.

449
00:27:13,164 --> 00:27:15,928
No, all I was told was
that it would cost this much...

450
00:27:16,001 --> 00:27:18,162
and it was gonna be lots of fun.

451
00:27:18,236 --> 00:27:19,498
Kate, where's the fun?

452
00:27:19,571 --> 00:27:23,098
Party Island is where
all the boats go for this huge party.

453
00:27:23,174 --> 00:27:26,200
It'll be all good, I'm telling you.

454
00:27:26,277 --> 00:27:28,507
Great.

455
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,810
Relax.

456
00:27:30,882 --> 00:27:32,713
Lance likes you.

457
00:27:32,784 --> 00:27:33,773
No, he doesn't.

458
00:27:33,852 --> 00:27:35,149
Oh, yes, he...

459
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,983
Oh, my God!

460
00:27:37,055 --> 00:27:37,987
Tom!

461
00:27:38,056 --> 00:27:39,956
Tom!

462
00:27:40,025 --> 00:27:42,255
You scared the living
daylights out of me.

463
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:44,295
I'm here to claim
the sexual prize.

464
00:27:44,362 --> 00:27:46,421
Uh, great, Kate.

465
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:48,193
I'm sorry, were you two
talking about me?

466
00:27:48,266 --> 00:27:49,358
I interrupt?

467
00:27:49,434 --> 00:27:51,698
You know, why don't you just
go throw Kate's mask overboard...

468
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:53,965
and then just go dive for it again?

469
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:57,031
Well, I could throw you overboard.
How about that?

470
00:27:57,108 --> 00:27:58,973
Stop it, Honey.

471
00:27:59,044 --> 00:28:01,376
You'll get your prize. Be nice.

472
00:28:41,419 --> 00:28:43,944
Sooner morning comes, the better.

473
00:28:44,022 --> 00:28:47,355
You got that right.

474
00:28:47,425 --> 00:28:49,893
Watch our back, Captain.

475
00:28:49,961 --> 00:28:52,589
I'll watch yours, you watch mine.

476
00:28:52,664 --> 00:28:55,599
It's a deal.

477
00:28:55,667 --> 00:28:56,793
Deal.

478
00:28:56,868 --> 00:28:59,928
I'll take first watch.

479
00:29:00,004 --> 00:29:01,904
I need coffee.

480
00:29:09,314 --> 00:29:12,408
Ash, you asleep?

481
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:16,713
Yes.

482
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:23,921
No. What?

483
00:29:23,995 --> 00:29:25,428
I'm going out.

484
00:29:25,497 --> 00:29:26,862
Out where?

485
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:28,728
On a date.

486
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,462
Kate...

487
00:29:31,536 --> 00:29:34,061
We're in the middle of the ocean.

488
00:29:34,139 --> 00:29:37,438
Besides, Tom was already here.

489
00:29:37,509 --> 00:29:38,806
It's not Tom.

490
00:29:43,681 --> 00:29:46,809
Joel...

491
00:29:46,885 --> 00:29:50,446
Where are you?

492
00:29:50,522 --> 00:29:52,114
Are you playing games?

493
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:54,886
I like games.
Little hide-and-seek?

494
00:29:56,728 --> 00:29:58,127
Joel!

495
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:07,638
I'll find you.

496
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:13,709
Joel!

497
00:30:13,778 --> 00:30:15,871
We're right in the middle of nowhere.

498
00:30:20,451 --> 00:30:22,681
Hello?

499
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:30,586
Hold on.

500
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:34,025
OK. Now you can...

501
00:30:34,098 --> 00:30:35,622
Is Joel in here?

502
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:38,134
No, Joel's not in here.

503
00:30:39,237 --> 00:30:40,329
He should be up on deck.

504
00:30:40,405 --> 00:30:43,738
I... I checked,
and he's not up there.

505
00:30:43,808 --> 00:30:44,900
Well, he's probably on deck.

506
00:30:44,976 --> 00:30:46,170
I mean, he's not here.

507
00:30:46,244 --> 00:30:48,474
He can't have taken a walk.
We're on a boat.

508
00:30:48,546 --> 00:30:50,776
- I looked.
- You check the helm?

509
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:52,339
Yes. I didn't see him.

510
00:30:57,822 --> 00:31:00,188
What in the world's
going on here?

511
00:31:00,258 --> 00:31:01,987
You tell me.

512
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:03,550
Get everybody on deck, now.

513
00:31:03,628 --> 00:31:04,560
But what about J...

514
00:31:04,629 --> 00:31:05,891
Now!

515
00:31:11,002 --> 00:31:12,936
Guys, get up!

516
00:31:13,004 --> 00:31:13,936
We're sleeping!

517
00:31:14,005 --> 00:31:15,029
I know! Get up.

518
00:31:15,106 --> 00:31:17,165
Captain wants everyone
on deck, now!

519
00:31:17,242 --> 00:31:19,176
Ash? Ash...

520
00:31:19,244 --> 00:31:21,075
Get up, babe.

521
00:31:21,145 --> 00:31:23,909
Ash, come on. Just come on.

522
00:31:23,982 --> 00:31:25,882
We have to go up on deck.

523
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:29,413
Hurry.

524
00:31:29,487 --> 00:31:31,352
I'm going, I'm going.

525
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:39,390
Just go.

526
00:31:54,812 --> 00:31:56,279
What did you do to my boat?

527
00:31:56,347 --> 00:31:59,214
Your boat? How about
what you did to Joel?

528
00:31:59,284 --> 00:32:00,945
OK, what did you do to Joel?

529
00:32:01,019 --> 00:32:02,350
What are you talking about?

530
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:03,785
My navigation equipment
is gone...

531
00:32:03,855 --> 00:32:06,881
My navigator's missing.
The dinghy's gone!

532
00:32:06,958 --> 00:32:08,289
Hey, Mr. Holmes,
doesn't it make sense...

533
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:10,122
that if he did this, then he left?

534
00:32:10,194 --> 00:32:11,627
Not Joel.

535
00:32:11,696 --> 00:32:13,994
Not Joel? Who?

536
00:32:14,065 --> 00:32:16,431
Well, somebody who understands
how to work this equipment.

537
00:32:18,069 --> 00:32:19,627
Derek it is, then.

538
00:32:19,704 --> 00:32:21,069
Wrong.

539
00:32:21,139 --> 00:32:23,107
I don't understand
anything above water.

540
00:32:23,174 --> 00:32:24,903
Come on, is there someone
we can call?

541
00:32:24,976 --> 00:32:26,068
What's going on?

542
00:32:26,144 --> 00:32:27,304
You can use my cell phone.

543
00:32:27,378 --> 00:32:30,040
Yeah, if someone would
bring us the keys.

544
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:31,809
Battery's dead.

545
00:32:31,883 --> 00:32:34,351
I tried it yesterday.

546
00:32:34,419 --> 00:32:37,149
I have a spare, but thanks, Kate.

547
00:32:37,221 --> 00:32:38,586
What I'm trying to say
is whoever did this...

548
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:40,624
wants us to stay here.

549
00:32:40,692 --> 00:32:43,183
OK, so we stay.
I mean, what's the big deal?

550
00:32:43,261 --> 00:32:45,456
It's not like he took the food, right?

551
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:47,691
No, but we're stuck here
until somebody finds us...

552
00:32:47,765 --> 00:32:50,427
or we get some keys.
Now, listen.

553
00:32:50,501 --> 00:32:52,765
First light tomorrow, we get up
we search for clues...

554
00:32:52,837 --> 00:32:55,397
We try to find out
what else is missing.

555
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:58,499
And for the love of God,
please try not to disappear.

556
00:33:10,688 --> 00:33:14,089
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Come here. Come here.

557
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:17,457
<i>Um, remember
what Interficio means?</i>

558
00:33:17,528 --> 00:33:21,259
Oh, yeah? To disappear?

559
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:22,959
No.

560
00:33:26,371 --> 00:33:28,032
Oh, my God. Is that blood?

561
00:33:28,106 --> 00:33:29,733
I wonder if it's Joel's.

562
00:33:29,807 --> 00:33:30,796
Great.

563
00:33:30,875 --> 00:33:34,436
<i>So, like I was saying, Interficio?</i>

564
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:36,707
It means "murder. "

565
00:33:36,781 --> 00:33:38,248
I don't like this.

566
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:44,651
Red sky at night, sailor's delight.

567
00:33:44,722 --> 00:33:48,624
Red sky at morn, sailors be warned.

568
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:50,923
Kate...

569
00:33:50,995 --> 00:33:53,657
What if it was one of us?

570
00:33:53,731 --> 00:33:55,289
Psychology...

571
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:57,630
I'm serious.

572
00:33:57,702 --> 00:34:01,001
What? The loss of the equipment,
or the disappearance of Joel?

573
00:34:01,072 --> 00:34:02,835
Both.

574
00:34:02,907 --> 00:34:05,068
Ok. Who?

575
00:34:05,143 --> 00:34:07,134
That weirdo captain!

576
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:08,371
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

577
00:34:08,446 --> 00:34:09,970
He would not do this
to his own stuff.

578
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:12,346
I don't know! He might!
I mean, to throw off suspicion.

579
00:34:12,417 --> 00:34:14,044
He did name his boat...

580
00:34:14,118 --> 00:34:15,483
It's so weird.

581
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:18,113
No. That's a coincidence. It's...

582
00:34:18,189 --> 00:34:19,178
Derek!

583
00:34:21,759 --> 00:34:22,851
Motivation?

584
00:34:22,927 --> 00:34:25,691
To get even with the captain.

585
00:34:25,763 --> 00:34:27,697
And he is working class.

586
00:34:27,765 --> 00:34:30,131
Good point. Good point.

587
00:34:30,201 --> 00:34:32,192
And then again,
you are working class.

588
00:34:34,972 --> 00:34:36,837
What about Tom?

589
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:39,342
Why?

590
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:40,502
Jealousy.

591
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:42,671
He always wants to be
the brains of the operation.

592
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:45,716
That's good.

593
00:34:45,783 --> 00:34:48,047
Lance.

594
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:50,019
No way!

595
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:52,215
Why? You pick my boyfriend,
I pick yours.

596
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:54,315
He is not my boyfriend.

597
00:34:54,392 --> 00:34:56,792
OK.

598
00:34:56,861 --> 00:34:58,954
But he still could have done it.

599
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:00,691
No. No way.

600
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:02,926
I mean, he has no motivation.

601
00:35:04,202 --> 00:35:05,191
You.

602
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:07,571
You.

603
00:35:07,638 --> 00:35:09,230
Motivation?

604
00:35:14,545 --> 00:35:15,978
The black widow.

605
00:35:16,047 --> 00:35:18,140
She mates, then she kills.

606
00:35:18,216 --> 00:35:21,117
That's good.

607
00:35:21,185 --> 00:35:22,652
You.

608
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,779
Motivation?

609
00:35:24,856 --> 00:35:26,380
Daddy's little girl,

610
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:28,823
Looking for her own identity.

611
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,794
Money doesn't buy everything.

612
00:35:31,863 --> 00:35:33,694
That's good.

613
00:35:36,601 --> 00:35:38,330
Or, you know, it just
could have been Joel.

614
00:35:38,402 --> 00:35:40,199
Good point.

615
00:35:40,271 --> 00:35:41,465
What are we thinking?

616
00:35:41,539 --> 00:35:44,406
Where is he, anyway?

617
00:35:45,676 --> 00:35:47,268
Creepy.

618
00:36:16,607 --> 00:36:19,075
# My timbers did shiver #

619
00:36:19,143 --> 00:36:21,976
# My head it did hum #

620
00:36:22,046 --> 00:36:24,742
# Filago, filago #

621
00:36:24,815 --> 00:36:26,840
# Filago-rum #

622
00:36:46,304 --> 00:36:47,464
I can't believe
we're stuck here again...

623
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:49,802
another night, with no wind.

624
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:51,808
It's not so bad.

625
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:56,006
Oh, well, somebody will find us.

626
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,138
I'm leaving in a minute.

627
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:59,479
Where are you going?

628
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:01,142
To kill someone.

629
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:04,052
Yeah, well,
when will you be back?

630
00:37:04,121 --> 00:37:05,645
Before you wake up.

631
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:08,157
You promise?

632
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:10,057
Promise.

633
00:37:24,842 --> 00:37:26,469
Captain?

634
00:37:35,286 --> 00:37:36,913
Captain?

635
00:37:40,291 --> 00:37:42,316
Captain?

636
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:57,934
Not again.

637
00:41:30,454 --> 00:41:31,443
Kate?

638
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:34,916
Kate?

639
00:42:04,488 --> 00:42:06,786
Hey!

640
00:42:06,857 --> 00:42:10,588
Somebody help me!

641
00:42:10,661 --> 00:42:11,628
No!

642
00:42:23,173 --> 00:42:25,368
Hey! Anybody!

643
00:42:25,442 --> 00:42:28,377
Oh, my God!
There's a shark!

644
00:42:28,445 --> 00:42:29,639
Hey! Hey, there's a shark!

645
00:42:30,814 --> 00:42:32,304
Help me!

646
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:42,185
Please! Somebody help me!

647
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:48,091
Help!

648
00:43:17,795 --> 00:43:18,762
Couldn't sleep?

649
00:43:18,829 --> 00:43:20,194
Nope.

650
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:21,629
Is Lance asleep?

651
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:28,203
You tell me.

652
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:29,864
What does that mean?

653
00:43:31,075 --> 00:43:32,269
Well...

654
00:43:34,912 --> 00:43:36,379
It means that you seem to know...

655
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:39,439
everything about everybody's actions
and whereabouts.

656
00:43:39,516 --> 00:43:42,610
So, you tell me.
Is Lance in his room or isn't he?

657
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:51,989
No. No, he's not in his room.

658
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:58,261
Hey.

659
00:43:58,335 --> 00:43:59,267
What are you two doing here?

660
00:44:01,438 --> 00:44:04,566
I'm making Derek a sandwich.

661
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:05,609
OK?

662
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:13,583
Why?

663
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:15,482
I just figured you'd be in bed.

664
00:44:15,552 --> 00:44:17,383
Nah, he's not my type.

665
00:44:17,454 --> 00:44:19,445
Funny guy.

666
00:44:20,791 --> 00:44:21,723
Why aren't you in bed?

667
00:44:21,792 --> 00:44:23,657
I couldn't sleep.

668
00:44:23,727 --> 00:44:26,161
I mean, with Joel missing and all.

669
00:44:51,789 --> 00:44:54,019
OK.

670
00:44:54,091 --> 00:44:56,025
I'm gonna go back to bed.

671
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:01,054
You want me to join you?

672
00:45:01,131 --> 00:45:03,122
No, no.

673
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,725
I'll be fine by myself, thanks.

674
00:45:05,803 --> 00:45:08,328
Besides, what would Kate say?

675
00:45:08,405 --> 00:45:10,532
Nothing.

676
00:45:14,178 --> 00:45:15,611
I'll pass anyway.

677
00:45:19,616 --> 00:45:21,641
She sure seemed jumpy.

678
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:23,584
Yeah. I wonder why.

679
00:46:05,329 --> 00:46:07,524
I'm going back to the cabin.

680
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:09,532
I think I'll stay here a little longer.

681
00:46:11,635 --> 00:46:13,364
Suit yourself.

682
00:46:13,437 --> 00:46:15,405
Have you seen
the captain tonight?

683
00:46:15,472 --> 00:46:17,770
Have you?

684
00:46:17,841 --> 00:46:21,299
Would you stop it with the games?

685
00:46:21,378 --> 00:46:24,108
OK.

686
00:46:24,181 --> 00:46:27,344
All right...

687
00:46:27,417 --> 00:46:29,885
Is the captain missing?

688
00:46:29,953 --> 00:46:31,443
He was in his cabin
at the front of the boat.

689
00:46:31,522 --> 00:46:32,853
Oh, so, he's not missing then?

690
00:46:36,994 --> 00:46:40,760
Look, can I ask you a question?

691
00:46:44,601 --> 00:46:46,364
Shoot.

692
00:46:46,436 --> 00:46:48,097
Ever since I got here...

693
00:46:48,172 --> 00:46:51,903
You've had some kind
of problem with me.

694
00:46:51,975 --> 00:46:53,966
Why is that?

695
00:46:54,044 --> 00:46:55,238
What did I do to you?

696
00:47:01,418 --> 00:47:02,885
It's not what you did to me.

697
00:47:08,425 --> 00:47:09,517
It's Kate.

698
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:15,059
She wanted you. I mean...

699
00:47:15,132 --> 00:47:18,295
From the minute she saw you,
I saw it in her eyes.

700
00:47:19,570 --> 00:47:21,162
I couldn't let her do it.

701
00:47:21,238 --> 00:47:24,207
Do what? Isn't that her choice?

702
00:47:28,879 --> 00:47:31,006
Well, everybody has their choices.

703
00:47:34,651 --> 00:47:36,209
Let me ask you something.

704
00:47:38,555 --> 00:47:39,681
Do you like Kate?

705
00:48:04,114 --> 00:48:05,581
OK.

706
00:48:31,174 --> 00:48:35,304
# Filigo, filigo-ree #

707
00:48:50,994 --> 00:48:52,723
Ashley.

708
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:57,696
Silly girl.

709
00:49:00,637 --> 00:49:02,867
Cute...

710
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:04,532
but silly.

711
00:49:19,489 --> 00:49:21,286
Not yet.

712
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:35,324
Captain, we have visitors.

713
00:50:51,415 --> 00:50:52,882
Come on!

714
00:52:27,711 --> 00:52:28,905
Where are you, Kate?

715
00:52:55,705 --> 00:52:57,570
Oh, my God! No!

716
00:52:57,641 --> 00:52:59,438
Oh, my God!

717
00:52:59,509 --> 00:53:01,272
No, no!

718
00:53:02,913 --> 00:53:04,107
God, no!

719
00:53:30,807 --> 00:53:32,798
Oh, God!

720
00:53:32,876 --> 00:53:35,902
Oh, God!

721
00:53:35,979 --> 00:53:38,243
Oh, God!

722
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:44,346
Why did he capture you?

723
00:53:44,421 --> 00:53:45,353
You OK?

724
00:53:45,422 --> 00:53:46,889
Yeah, yeah. I'm fine.

725
00:53:55,732 --> 00:53:58,701
Everybody's gone.
Everybody's gone.

726
00:53:58,768 --> 00:54:00,133
Tom's dead.

727
00:54:01,972 --> 00:54:02,904
OK.

728
00:54:02,973 --> 00:54:06,409
So, then, how about the bad news?

729
00:54:06,476 --> 00:54:08,171
This boat is sinking.

730
00:54:08,245 --> 00:54:09,371
You think?

731
00:54:13,183 --> 00:54:14,582
OK.

732
00:54:14,651 --> 00:54:15,675
OK, the engine's on.

733
00:54:15,752 --> 00:54:18,687
That explains the hum
and probably the water.

734
00:54:18,755 --> 00:54:21,019
Who had the keys?

735
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:25,152
Maybe Joel still has them.

736
00:54:25,228 --> 00:54:26,786
So, what are we gonna do?

737
00:54:26,863 --> 00:54:28,353
Well, we're gonna find out
who started the engine...

738
00:54:28,431 --> 00:54:29,830
And then why we're sinking.

739
00:54:29,899 --> 00:54:30,831
Come on. Get a life jacket.

740
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:31,832
Wait, wait, wait.

741
00:54:31,901 --> 00:54:33,095
Did you actually
see Joel hit you?

742
00:54:33,169 --> 00:54:34,534
No. He hit me on the back of...

743
00:54:34,604 --> 00:54:35,798
Somebody hit me
on the back of the head.

744
00:54:35,872 --> 00:54:36,804
I blacked out.

745
00:54:36,873 --> 00:54:38,204
When I woke up, I...
nobody was around...

746
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:42,439
OK, so, there could still be
somebody else on this boat?

747
00:54:42,512 --> 00:54:43,706
Yeah. Probably.

748
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:46,681
That's why they left Tom
hanging there to scare us.

749
00:54:46,750 --> 00:54:48,183
Well, it worked!

750
00:54:48,251 --> 00:54:49,718
Yeah, it did.

751
00:54:52,155 --> 00:54:53,747
I can't do this.

752
00:54:53,823 --> 00:54:55,723
No!

753
00:54:55,792 --> 00:54:56,724
God, no more!

754
00:54:56,793 --> 00:54:58,283
I can't do this anymore!

755
00:54:58,361 --> 00:54:59,487
Easy with the knife.

756
00:55:02,065 --> 00:55:03,498
If they're going to take us down...

757
00:55:03,566 --> 00:55:06,194
I'm not going down without a fight.

758
00:55:06,269 --> 00:55:07,429
That a girl.

759
00:55:07,504 --> 00:55:10,837
Two heads are better than one.

760
00:55:10,907 --> 00:55:12,875
And I got a knife.

761
00:55:12,942 --> 00:55:14,876
Yeah, you do.

762
00:55:14,944 --> 00:55:16,536
Me, too.

763
00:55:21,418 --> 00:55:23,352
He's dead, Captain.

764
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:24,785
I'll be the judge of that.

765
00:55:29,092 --> 00:55:31,959
- Here.
- Yeah, he's dead, all right.

766
00:55:32,028 --> 00:55:33,017
Careful.

767
00:55:33,096 --> 00:55:34,620
Yeah, he is dead.

768
00:55:34,698 --> 00:55:35,824
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

769
00:55:35,899 --> 00:55:38,060
He's got no pulse.

770
00:55:38,134 --> 00:55:39,431
Nice work.

771
00:55:41,805 --> 00:55:44,273
You sure you didn't do this?

772
00:55:44,341 --> 00:55:45,603
No, I didn't.

773
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:49,804
There's nobody down here.

774
00:55:49,879 --> 00:55:51,540
Well, maybe they're all up top.

775
00:55:51,614 --> 00:55:52,876
Where do you think they are?

776
00:55:52,949 --> 00:55:54,416
I'm hoping they're up above.

777
00:55:56,052 --> 00:55:59,351
No! After you.

778
00:55:59,422 --> 00:56:02,118
Ladies first. Go ahead.

779
00:56:02,192 --> 00:56:04,126
- Gentlemen.
- That's all right.

780
00:56:04,194 --> 00:56:05,354
Come on, I'll go first.

781
00:56:05,428 --> 00:56:06,520
I'm right behind you.

782
00:56:07,964 --> 00:56:09,192
- Really.
- Yeah.

783
00:56:09,265 --> 00:56:10,357
Well, watch your back.

784
00:56:11,534 --> 00:56:13,627
And you watch your front.

785
00:56:50,039 --> 00:56:52,030
The master key.

786
00:56:52,108 --> 00:56:53,040
Surprise, surprise.

787
00:56:53,109 --> 00:56:54,508
Who had that key?

788
00:56:55,612 --> 00:56:56,943
Joel.

789
00:56:58,047 --> 00:57:00,607
Super.

790
00:57:00,683 --> 00:57:02,674
At least we know
we got a great first mate.

791
00:57:02,752 --> 00:57:05,243
Well, thank you very much.

792
00:57:07,257 --> 00:57:11,193
Can you explain to me again
how the boat is sinking?

793
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:14,059
Well, best bet is the water intake.

794
00:57:14,130 --> 00:57:16,325
Water's going into the engine room
instead of the water tank.

795
00:57:16,399 --> 00:57:17,889
Then the pump ain't working.

796
00:57:17,967 --> 00:57:19,935
If we shut down the engine,
that should take care of it.

797
00:57:20,003 --> 00:57:21,197
Should?

798
00:57:21,271 --> 00:57:23,296
Yeah, should.
At least, it can cut the exhaust.

799
00:57:23,373 --> 00:57:25,204
That smokes up the whole boat.

800
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:28,802
Don't you need to know something
about boats or whatever...

801
00:57:28,878 --> 00:57:30,209
in order to do something like that?

802
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:31,941
Or engines, in general, yeah.

803
00:57:34,017 --> 00:57:36,485
Let me guess. Joel.

804
00:57:37,887 --> 00:57:39,718
Yeah. Joel.

805
00:57:40,757 --> 00:57:42,725
You must really have done
something to piss him off, huh?

806
00:57:46,863 --> 00:57:48,831
Look, I'm sorry about Tom.

807
00:57:55,538 --> 00:57:57,199
Whatever...

808
00:57:59,542 --> 00:58:01,271
He was a jerk anyway, you know?

809
00:58:03,947 --> 00:58:04,914
Well, if he was a jerk, then I guess...

810
00:58:04,981 --> 00:58:06,676
we can leave him
hanging there, huh?

811
00:58:06,749 --> 00:58:10,082
Look, right now,
I'm really just way more concerned...

812
00:58:10,153 --> 00:58:12,417
about Kate and Lance and Derek.

813
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:14,684
Not to mention you and I, you know?

814
00:58:14,757 --> 00:58:17,351
Well, at least we haven't
found their bodies.

815
00:58:17,427 --> 00:58:19,918
That's because they're alive.
They are.

816
00:58:19,996 --> 00:58:21,861
OK, we would have
found them if they weren't.

817
00:58:21,931 --> 00:58:23,057
Just like I found you.

818
00:58:23,132 --> 00:58:25,100
- Where'd they go?
- I don't know, but they're alive!

819
00:58:25,168 --> 00:58:26,430
OK. They're alive.

820
00:58:26,503 --> 00:58:28,266
They're just
on some other boat somewhere.

821
00:58:28,338 --> 00:58:30,272
- What other boat?
- I don't know. Some other boat.

822
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:32,240
There are no other boats!

823
00:58:32,308 --> 00:58:33,935
What's that?

824
00:58:40,149 --> 00:58:41,741
I have no idea.

825
00:58:43,887 --> 00:58:46,185
Should, uh, should we
signal 'em or something?

826
00:58:46,256 --> 00:58:48,781
With what? There's nothing left.
Everything's missing.

827
00:58:48,858 --> 00:58:49,916
They're gone, anyway.

828
00:58:49,993 --> 00:58:52,086
Yeah, but that's a good sign.
That gives us hope, right?

829
00:58:52,161 --> 00:58:53,753
I mean, they're going
to come back probably.

830
00:58:56,199 --> 00:58:58,224
The better question is...

831
00:59:00,236 --> 00:59:03,296
if these are the folks
that are doing this...

832
00:59:03,373 --> 00:59:05,739
we don't really want 'em
to come back, do we?

833
00:59:08,211 --> 00:59:10,441
Wait a minute. I thought we decided
that Joel did this.

834
00:59:10,513 --> 00:59:13,812
No, I don't think so.
It doesn't feel right.

835
00:59:13,883 --> 00:59:15,680
It doesn't feel right?

836
00:59:17,387 --> 00:59:18,752
Joel didn't do this.

837
00:59:23,026 --> 00:59:25,995
OK, well, then, who did,
Captain, because...

838
00:59:26,062 --> 00:59:27,962
it's only you and I left.

839
00:59:36,039 --> 00:59:37,336
Oh, come on.

840
00:59:40,743 --> 00:59:42,677
This isn't some sort of...

841
00:59:42,745 --> 00:59:45,305
sick game for you, is it?

842
00:59:45,381 --> 00:59:46,973
What are you talking about?

843
00:59:49,185 --> 00:59:51,016
Oh, my God.
Just stay away from me.

844
00:59:51,087 --> 00:59:52,247
Ashley...

845
00:59:52,322 --> 00:59:54,950
I got it!
That's it! You were gonna...

846
00:59:55,024 --> 00:59:56,423
Becoming a psycho!

847
00:59:56,492 --> 00:59:57,857
What'd you do with them?

848
00:59:57,927 --> 00:59:59,258
Ashley, you don't even know
what you're talking about...

849
00:59:59,329 --> 01:00:01,923
For God's sake.
Just put the knife down.

850
01:00:01,998 --> 01:00:03,192
Stay away from me.

851
01:00:03,266 --> 01:00:05,826
Think, OK? Think.

852
01:00:05,902 --> 01:00:08,564
I was tied up in the shower.
How... who started the engine?

853
01:00:08,638 --> 01:00:11,937
Yeah, but before that.
You could have planned all this...

854
01:00:12,008 --> 01:00:12,997
and tied yourself up.

855
01:00:13,076 --> 01:00:14,873
You are a sailor.
You know how to tie knots.

856
01:00:14,944 --> 01:00:17,469
You're not even making any sense.

857
01:00:17,547 --> 01:00:20,880
Then explain something to me, OK?

858
01:00:20,950 --> 01:00:26,354
You yourself said that we
were the last two people on this boat.

859
01:00:26,422 --> 01:00:27,354
I know I didn't do it.

860
01:00:27,423 --> 01:00:30,085
How do I know that?

861
01:00:30,159 --> 01:00:31,091
Seriously.

862
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:32,422
Oh, please.

863
01:00:32,495 --> 01:00:34,520
No, no. Really.
How do I know that?

864
01:00:34,597 --> 01:00:35,723
How do I know
this isn't some prank...

865
01:00:35,798 --> 01:00:37,060
that you guys figured out...

866
01:00:37,133 --> 01:00:40,068
and they're on a boat somewhere
laughing and Tom's alive?

867
01:00:41,270 --> 01:00:43,602
You're sick.

868
01:00:43,673 --> 01:00:44,765
Am I?

869
01:00:44,841 --> 01:00:46,433
You did this.

870
01:00:46,509 --> 01:00:47,942
No.

871
01:00:49,812 --> 01:00:52,303
No, I didn't. But I'm beginning
to think you did.

872
01:00:53,683 --> 01:00:56,015
OK.

873
01:00:56,085 --> 01:00:57,211
You don't trust me.

874
01:00:58,388 --> 01:00:59,548
Fair enough.

875
01:00:59,622 --> 01:01:02,614
Right now, I sure don't trust you.

876
01:01:02,692 --> 01:01:04,387
True.

877
01:01:04,460 --> 01:01:05,484
We've both got knives.

878
01:01:05,561 --> 01:01:07,495
That's also true.

879
01:01:07,563 --> 01:01:10,498
Yeah.

880
01:01:10,566 --> 01:01:11,658
I got a proposal.

881
01:01:11,734 --> 01:01:13,565
OK, fine. I'll listen.

882
01:01:13,636 --> 01:01:15,501
But just don't come
any closer to me, OK?

883
01:01:15,571 --> 01:01:16,629
Fine.

884
01:01:16,706 --> 01:01:17,832
You stay on one part
of the boat...

885
01:01:17,907 --> 01:01:19,602
I'll stay on the other part
of the boat.

886
01:01:19,676 --> 01:01:20,608
We'll stay topside.

887
01:01:20,677 --> 01:01:21,609
As long as we're
not near each other...

888
01:01:21,678 --> 01:01:22,940
we can't hurt each other, OK?

889
01:01:23,012 --> 01:01:24,070
And we'll just wait here.

890
01:01:24,147 --> 01:01:25,614
We'll sit tight
until the authorities come...

891
01:01:25,682 --> 01:01:26,706
then they'll work it out.

892
01:01:29,485 --> 01:01:31,453
OK, that's not...

893
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:32,715
That's not bad.

894
01:01:35,391 --> 01:01:37,359
Which side of the boat
do you want?

895
01:01:39,495 --> 01:01:41,656
Well, whichever side you don't take.

896
01:01:41,731 --> 01:01:43,028
I'm not moving.

897
01:01:43,099 --> 01:01:45,363
Fine. I'll head for the stern.

898
01:01:45,435 --> 01:01:46,732
Fine.

899
01:01:47,970 --> 01:01:50,564
Put the knife down.

900
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:52,005
When you get to the stern.

901
01:01:52,075 --> 01:01:53,838
- Fine.
- Fine!

902
01:02:11,861 --> 01:02:13,328
Storm's comin'.

903
01:02:55,671 --> 01:02:56,831
No!

904
01:02:56,906 --> 01:02:58,373
Don't touch her!

905
01:03:02,979 --> 01:03:04,241
Oh, my God.

906
01:03:06,349 --> 01:03:08,317
Oh, my God.

907
01:03:08,384 --> 01:03:09,373
Jesus.

908
01:03:09,452 --> 01:03:10,544
Who's there?

909
01:03:46,322 --> 01:03:48,882
Fine. Find them, Kate.

910
01:03:57,834 --> 01:03:59,062
Dang it!

911
01:04:03,072 --> 01:04:05,267
He started the engines.

912
01:04:15,284 --> 01:04:16,478
Joel?

913
01:04:18,054 --> 01:04:19,180
Joel?

914
01:04:21,123 --> 01:04:24,251
If this is you, I've got a knife
and I will kill you!

915
01:04:25,561 --> 01:04:27,495
Come and get me.

916
01:04:27,563 --> 01:04:31,932
And if it isn't, whoever it is,
you're gonna die, too.

917
01:04:38,975 --> 01:04:40,772
Come out, come out
wherever you are.

918
01:04:42,545 --> 01:04:45,810
God! Where are you?!

919
01:04:52,889 --> 01:04:55,289
OK, I am starting to get angry!

920
01:05:15,811 --> 01:05:16,778
Kate!

921
01:05:16,846 --> 01:05:19,212
Tom!

922
01:05:26,889 --> 01:05:28,550
Oh, my God! Tom!

923
01:05:29,592 --> 01:05:30,684
It's OK. It's OK.

924
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:33,354
- Oh, my God! They're all dead!
- I'm here. I'm here.

925
01:05:33,429 --> 01:05:35,090
Everybody is dead.

926
01:05:35,164 --> 01:05:36,392
Oh, God!

927
01:05:36,465 --> 01:05:39,195
Look at me. Hey!

928
01:05:39,268 --> 01:05:42,101
# You helped me to kill #

929
01:05:42,171 --> 01:05:44,230
# By feeling much glee #

930
01:05:44,307 --> 01:05:47,504
# Filigo, filigo filigo-ree #

931
01:05:47,576 --> 01:05:49,203
# And a man can say little #

932
01:05:49,278 --> 01:05:51,143
# When he is dead #

933
01:05:51,213 --> 01:05:53,579
# Filigo, filigo, filigo-red #

934
01:05:53,649 --> 01:05:56,140
# As we walk hand-in-hand #

935
01:05:56,218 --> 01:05:59,312
# With old death on the beach #

936
01:05:59,388 --> 01:06:02,949
# Forever the Black Jack
cries old Mr. Teach #

937
01:06:03,025 --> 01:06:04,720
You're dead, you're dead!

938
01:06:04,794 --> 01:06:07,490
I saw you! You were hanging!
And every...

939
01:06:07,563 --> 01:06:09,224
I know. I know.

940
01:06:09,298 --> 01:06:12,597
It's realism, baby. Did you like it?
Did you like it?

941
01:06:12,668 --> 01:06:14,295
But who I can't believe...

942
01:06:14,370 --> 01:06:17,737
I can't believe that this guy
missed my pulse.

943
01:06:17,807 --> 01:06:19,775
I mean, what are
the chances of that?

944
01:06:19,842 --> 01:06:22,572
I thought he had me.
It's just dumb luck.

945
01:06:22,645 --> 01:06:26,172
You should always,
always go for the neck.

946
01:06:26,248 --> 01:06:28,148
Thank you, by the way,
for giving him my arm.

947
01:06:28,217 --> 01:06:29,775
Stay away from me!

948
01:06:29,852 --> 01:06:31,012
Hey. Hey.

949
01:06:31,087 --> 01:06:33,112
Did you work it out, huh?

950
01:06:33,189 --> 01:06:34,588
I mean, it's priceless.

951
01:06:34,657 --> 01:06:37,854
When you called the captain
a psycho. I loved that!

952
01:06:37,927 --> 01:06:40,452
Come on.

953
01:06:40,529 --> 01:06:43,657
The sailor's knots, the hanging...

954
01:06:43,733 --> 01:06:45,860
It was the right idea,
but the wrong guy.

955
01:06:45,935 --> 01:06:48,096
And then, when you
went back to the cabin...

956
01:06:48,170 --> 01:06:49,330
and I wasn't there anymore?

957
01:06:49,405 --> 01:06:51,100
Come on! You're smarter than this.

958
01:06:51,173 --> 01:06:53,198
I have a knife!

959
01:06:53,275 --> 01:06:54,537
So do I.

960
01:06:54,610 --> 01:06:55,542
Come on, come on.

961
01:06:55,611 --> 01:06:57,511
Can we stop going in circles here?

962
01:06:57,580 --> 01:06:59,605
No!

963
01:06:59,682 --> 01:07:02,617
OK. OK.
I'm gonna sit right here...

964
01:07:02,685 --> 01:07:06,280
and I'm gonna wait for you
to come to me.

965
01:07:06,355 --> 01:07:07,879
It won't happen.

966
01:07:07,957 --> 01:07:10,448
We're the only people on this boat.

967
01:07:10,526 --> 01:07:12,858
What did you do with them?

968
01:07:12,928 --> 01:07:14,293
Do you really want to know?

969
01:07:14,363 --> 01:07:15,660
I really do.

970
01:07:15,731 --> 01:07:18,063
OK.

971
01:07:18,134 --> 01:07:19,795
Well, first, there was Joel.

972
01:07:19,869 --> 01:07:23,498
Oh, my God. The campfire.

973
01:07:25,007 --> 01:07:27,999
See, now, you're getting smart.

974
01:07:29,879 --> 01:07:31,346
I know the rest.

975
01:07:31,414 --> 01:07:34,713
I buried this knife at the island, too.

976
01:07:34,784 --> 01:07:35,716
You remember?

977
01:07:35,785 --> 01:07:37,275
You're sick!

978
01:07:39,722 --> 01:07:41,622
That your psychological diagnosis?

979
01:07:44,226 --> 01:07:46,160
My psychological diagnosis...

980
01:07:46,228 --> 01:07:50,562
is Antisocial Personality Disorder.

981
01:07:50,633 --> 01:07:52,260
Your motivation...

982
01:07:52,334 --> 01:07:54,962
is that you lie and you cheat...

983
01:07:55,037 --> 01:07:55,969
and you steal...

984
01:07:56,038 --> 01:07:59,030
and you even murder...

985
01:07:59,108 --> 01:08:01,668
without feeling any remorse.

986
01:08:05,081 --> 01:08:07,174
I should know.

987
01:08:08,784 --> 01:08:12,049
And now, don't get any bright ideas
about us teaming up together.

988
01:08:12,121 --> 01:08:14,180
Because...

989
01:08:14,256 --> 01:08:16,190
Because another factor
of this disorder...

990
01:08:17,893 --> 01:08:20,555
is that we work alone.

991
01:08:20,629 --> 01:08:23,189
And now, I get to kill you...

992
01:08:24,433 --> 01:08:26,697
without feeling bad about it.

993
01:08:26,769 --> 01:08:27,997
You get to try.

994
01:08:29,105 --> 01:08:30,834
You remember how
I didn't want to die?

995
01:08:32,374 --> 01:08:33,363
Suffocation?

996
01:08:33,442 --> 01:08:34,841
Right. And how about you?

997
01:08:36,846 --> 01:08:37,904
Throat cut.

998
01:08:37,980 --> 01:08:40,210
I have a knife. Coincidence?

999
01:08:41,317 --> 01:08:42,807
Why didn't you
just stab me in the back...

1000
01:08:42,885 --> 01:08:44,284
when you had the chance, huh?

1001
01:08:44,353 --> 01:08:47,345
You're the psychologist.
You tell me.

1002
01:08:49,925 --> 01:08:52,655
Because you're twisted.

1003
01:08:54,830 --> 01:08:57,390
Because you needed
to tell somebody.

1004
01:08:57,466 --> 01:08:59,229
Partially.

1005
01:08:59,301 --> 01:09:00,734
You know, why don't you
just keep thinking about it...

1006
01:09:00,803 --> 01:09:02,668
While I run
through the game, huh?

1007
01:09:02,738 --> 01:09:04,933
Is that what you call this, a game?

1008
01:09:05,007 --> 01:09:07,100
Well, what would you call it?

1009
01:09:07,176 --> 01:09:08,200
Murder.

1010
01:09:10,813 --> 01:09:13,941
OK. Murder.

1011
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:19,988
You know, for Kate's murder...

1012
01:09:20,055 --> 01:09:22,956
She just said murder, so...

1013
01:09:23,025 --> 01:09:24,287
I used this knife.

1014
01:09:26,962 --> 01:09:28,896
And Lance...

1015
01:09:30,299 --> 01:09:31,732
He's afraid of sharks.

1016
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:33,995
Oh, sick bastard.

1017
01:09:37,373 --> 01:09:39,933
What is it you used to say to Kate?

1018
01:09:40,009 --> 01:09:42,273
No lectures.

1019
01:09:42,344 --> 01:09:44,710
And how would you know that?

1020
01:09:44,780 --> 01:09:45,906
She used to tell me stuff.

1021
01:09:45,981 --> 01:09:48,279
She was my girlfriend, remember?

1022
01:09:51,687 --> 01:09:54,383
She never liked you!

1023
01:09:54,456 --> 01:09:56,048
Well, she sure did piss me off!

1024
01:09:56,125 --> 01:09:59,117
You have a proven tendency
to want violence.

1025
01:09:59,195 --> 01:10:00,287
Yeah, well, you
still never told me...

1026
01:10:00,362 --> 01:10:03,160
why you did this.

1027
01:10:03,232 --> 01:10:04,961
You know, Derek...

1028
01:10:05,034 --> 01:10:07,468
He was afraid of drowning.

1029
01:10:07,536 --> 01:10:10,300
The captain, hooked.

1030
01:10:10,372 --> 01:10:12,533
But that would never kill him.

1031
01:10:12,608 --> 01:10:13,836
You know, I always thought...

1032
01:10:13,909 --> 01:10:15,570
The captain should go down
with the boat.

1033
01:10:15,644 --> 01:10:16,770
What do you think?

1034
01:10:19,381 --> 01:10:20,848
Aw, to hell with it.

1035
01:10:20,916 --> 01:10:23,316
I'm not superstitious.

1036
01:10:29,525 --> 01:10:32,050
Why did you do this, Tom?

1037
01:10:32,127 --> 01:10:34,721
You know what?

1038
01:10:36,498 --> 01:10:38,523
That's enough talk.

1039
01:10:38,601 --> 01:10:40,296
It's time for some action.

1040
01:10:41,971 --> 01:10:43,097
Let's rock and roll.

1041
01:10:43,172 --> 01:10:45,037
No!

1042
01:10:45,107 --> 01:10:46,039
Come over here!

1043
01:10:46,108 --> 01:10:47,905
Are you gonna try and drown us?

1044
01:10:47,977 --> 01:10:50,673
No! I'm gonna sink the boat!

1045
01:10:50,746 --> 01:10:52,976
Oh, yeah?

1046
01:10:53,048 --> 01:10:56,916
You want to die? Follow me!

1047
01:11:06,795 --> 01:11:10,595
Ashley? Where are you?

1048
01:11:13,535 --> 01:11:15,560
I'm gonna find ya.

1049
01:11:21,110 --> 01:11:23,738
Ashley, haven't we already
done this before?

1050
01:11:27,583 --> 01:11:29,551
Are you gonna be hanging
when I open this door?

1051
01:11:39,094 --> 01:11:41,324
I know where you are.

1052
01:11:43,299 --> 01:11:45,290
I know where you are!

1053
01:11:46,902 --> 01:11:49,871
It's a small boat, Ashley.
You can't hide.

1054
01:11:51,874 --> 01:11:53,637
You're right there, aren't you?

1055
01:11:53,709 --> 01:11:56,940
Ready? Get ready for this.

1056
01:11:59,114 --> 01:12:00,581
You idiot!

1057
01:12:07,156 --> 01:12:08,919
You just should have
checked in the closet!

1058
01:12:08,991 --> 01:12:12,154
It's not very smart!

1059
01:12:15,130 --> 01:12:16,461
You stupid girl!

1060
01:12:19,535 --> 01:12:22,095
Now I'm pissed!

1061
01:12:31,180 --> 01:12:33,671
I'm bleeding.

1062
01:12:33,749 --> 01:12:36,115
I'm gonna kill you!

1063
01:12:37,853 --> 01:12:39,787
God!

1064
01:12:39,855 --> 01:12:42,585
I'm gonna slit your throat, Ashley!

1065
01:12:42,658 --> 01:12:44,922
Come here!

1066
01:12:44,993 --> 01:12:47,894
The game is over!

1067
01:12:53,268 --> 01:12:55,828
Behind you!

1068
01:12:55,904 --> 01:12:59,340
How do you like
your stupid game now, Tom?

1069
01:13:01,276 --> 01:13:02,641
How's your shoulder feel?

1070
01:13:02,711 --> 01:13:04,542
So you knew you didn't
kill me, huh?

1071
01:13:04,613 --> 01:13:07,776
Of course not! That's not
how you wanted to die.

1072
01:13:07,850 --> 01:13:09,875
What this is is a game.

1073
01:13:09,952 --> 01:13:12,352
I am the damsel
in distress, you know?

1074
01:13:12,421 --> 01:13:14,514
I'm the victim, helpless.

1075
01:13:14,590 --> 01:13:16,421
But see, in my game...

1076
01:13:16,492 --> 01:13:19,791
the hunter becomes the hunted.

1077
01:13:19,862 --> 01:13:22,126
Yeah? But how far
is this game gonna go, huh?

1078
01:13:22,197 --> 01:13:23,994
You're smarter than this.

1079
01:13:24,066 --> 01:13:25,226
What do you mean I'm smarter?

1080
01:13:26,435 --> 01:13:28,096
Come on.

1081
01:13:28,170 --> 01:13:30,161
Are you gonna
suffocate me, Ashley?

1082
01:13:31,540 --> 01:13:33,132
Yes.

1083
01:13:33,208 --> 01:13:36,041
That's ridiculous.
We both have knives...

1084
01:13:36,111 --> 01:13:38,204
and I'm bigger than you
or haven't you noticed?

1085
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:41,647
You'll figure it out. Or die trying.

1086
01:13:41,717 --> 01:13:43,150
That's really funny, Ashley.

1087
01:13:43,218 --> 01:13:45,209
I thought so.

1088
01:13:47,990 --> 01:13:49,719
Still haven't answered
my question, Tom.

1089
01:13:49,792 --> 01:13:51,521
Which question is that?

1090
01:13:51,593 --> 01:13:52,890
Why?

1091
01:13:52,961 --> 01:13:54,986
OK. OK.

1092
01:13:55,063 --> 01:13:57,793
I did it...

1093
01:13:57,866 --> 01:14:00,232
to see if I could get away with it,
How about that?

1094
01:14:01,270 --> 01:14:02,635
I see.

1095
01:14:02,704 --> 01:14:06,071
And what, you just love the thrill?

1096
01:14:06,141 --> 01:14:07,631
Yeah, yeah.

1097
01:14:07,709 --> 01:14:10,200
I mean, hey, haven't
you ever had the urge...

1098
01:14:10,279 --> 01:14:12,645
to do something insane?

1099
01:14:12,714 --> 01:14:16,241
How does it feel
to kill someone, Ashley?

1100
01:14:16,318 --> 01:14:18,013
Do you know?

1101
01:14:18,086 --> 01:14:20,111
How does it feel to drive a car...

1102
01:14:20,189 --> 01:14:22,248
right into a wall at 70 miles an hour?

1103
01:14:22,324 --> 01:14:24,918
Or... or jump from an 80-story building?

1104
01:14:24,993 --> 01:14:29,157
I was curious, and now I know.

1105
01:14:29,231 --> 01:14:31,995
I know, at least about the killing part.

1106
01:14:33,602 --> 01:14:35,797
You wanted to see what it felt like.

1107
01:14:35,871 --> 01:14:37,839
Yes.

1108
01:14:37,906 --> 01:14:39,874
You are sick!

1109
01:14:39,942 --> 01:14:42,740
No. No.

1110
01:14:44,713 --> 01:14:48,171
I'm just livin' out a fetish, that's all.

1111
01:14:48,250 --> 01:14:49,740
I mean, hey, how did it feel...

1112
01:14:49,818 --> 01:14:51,251
when you stabbed me
in the shoulder?

1113
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:53,254
It was an adrenaline rush, right?

1114
01:14:53,322 --> 01:14:55,916
Double it, and then
you have some idea...

1115
01:14:55,991 --> 01:14:57,982
Of what it's like to go all the way.

1116
01:14:58,060 --> 01:14:59,357
Oh, yeah.

1117
01:14:59,428 --> 01:15:01,089
It's like a drug, Ashley.

1118
01:15:01,163 --> 01:15:04,223
You do it once,
you can't wait to do it again.

1119
01:15:04,299 --> 01:15:05,231
Just think about it.

1120
01:15:05,300 --> 01:15:08,030
I held their lives in my hand.

1121
01:15:08,103 --> 01:15:10,901
For just a minute, I was God.

1122
01:15:10,973 --> 01:15:12,702
It was beautiful.

1123
01:15:14,109 --> 01:15:15,736
Your turn.

1124
01:15:15,811 --> 01:15:18,143
Already?

1125
01:15:18,213 --> 01:15:19,942
Yeah. Tell me...

1126
01:15:20,015 --> 01:15:22,210
What is thing that
I keep forgetting?

1127
01:15:22,284 --> 01:15:24,013
I'm dying to know, Ashley.

1128
01:15:24,086 --> 01:15:25,849
Tell me. What is it?

1129
01:15:25,921 --> 01:15:28,890
Pirates, Tom.

1130
01:15:30,893 --> 01:15:32,087
Pirates?

1131
01:15:32,160 --> 01:15:34,287
Yeah, pirates.

1132
01:15:34,363 --> 01:15:36,456
You're gonna have to do
better than that, Ashley.

1133
01:15:38,267 --> 01:15:41,236
Yeah. Ever since we left port...

1134
01:15:42,571 --> 01:15:45,472
Why would pirates
be following us?

1135
01:15:45,541 --> 01:15:47,406
Ransom!

1136
01:15:47,476 --> 01:15:49,671
I am heir to the McDougal fortune.

1137
01:15:49,745 --> 01:15:51,906
I am worth a lot!

1138
01:15:51,980 --> 01:15:54,175
You are making this up.

1139
01:15:54,249 --> 01:15:56,308
Oh, am I?

1140
01:15:56,385 --> 01:15:57,317
Yes!

1141
01:15:59,054 --> 01:16:00,783
The captain was in on it.

1142
01:16:00,856 --> 01:16:03,654
Yeah, and Kate had it figured out.

1143
01:16:03,725 --> 01:16:05,920
No. No way, no way.

1144
01:16:05,994 --> 01:16:07,222
I don't believe you.

1145
01:16:09,131 --> 01:16:12,032
So I guess you didn't get away
with as much as you thought.

1146
01:16:12,100 --> 01:16:13,829
No. No.

1147
01:16:13,902 --> 01:16:15,494
Why didn't they stop me, huh?

1148
01:16:15,571 --> 01:16:17,562
Just as long as you didn't hurt me.

1149
01:16:19,374 --> 01:16:20,864
This is ridiculous.

1150
01:16:20,943 --> 01:16:21,875
Really?

1151
01:16:21,944 --> 01:16:22,968
Really!

1152
01:16:27,049 --> 01:16:29,108
Can we stop the game?

1153
01:16:34,656 --> 01:16:36,715
Sure.

1154
01:16:45,834 --> 01:16:47,426
I wasn't sure
you could really do it!

1155
01:16:47,502 --> 01:16:48,992
You were great.
You were awesome.

1156
01:16:49,071 --> 01:16:51,369
Thank you.
We stacked everybody up!

1157
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:52,873
Thanks, baby.

1158
01:16:52,941 --> 01:16:54,306
Did you have to stab me?

1159
01:16:54,376 --> 01:16:56,469
I'm sorry. I had to
keep up my character.

1160
01:16:56,545 --> 01:16:57,876
Oh, you did a great job.

1161
01:16:57,946 --> 01:16:59,470
Of course.

1162
01:17:00,849 --> 01:17:02,077
What's wrong? Have a little faith.

1163
01:17:03,285 --> 01:17:05,879
I killed them all.
I killed them all.

1164
01:17:05,954 --> 01:17:07,751
For you, baby. For you.

1165
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:12,622
I love you.

1166
01:17:12,694 --> 01:17:14,889
Kate, Lance, Derek...

1167
01:17:14,963 --> 01:17:16,089
I didn't even like that one.

1168
01:17:16,164 --> 01:17:19,224
And the captain.
Getting rid of Joel.

1169
01:17:19,301 --> 01:17:21,633
And now you give me
a million dollars, baby.

1170
01:17:21,703 --> 01:17:23,034
A million dollars in cash.

1171
01:17:25,641 --> 01:17:29,236
There are some things
money can't buy, Tom.

1172
01:17:29,311 --> 01:17:32,212
Oh, why did we
ever break up?

1173
01:17:34,082 --> 01:17:37,381
Well, I was never good enough
or smart enough for you, Ash.

1174
01:17:37,452 --> 01:17:39,511
Please!

1175
01:17:39,588 --> 01:17:42,716
I hired you, didn't I?

1176
01:17:44,826 --> 01:17:47,192
Have you ever been smothered?

1177
01:17:50,499 --> 01:17:52,865
With kisses, I mean.

1178
01:17:52,934 --> 01:17:54,697
This'll be the first time.

1179
01:17:55,837 --> 01:17:56,804
Tom.

1180
01:17:58,173 --> 01:18:00,164
Come here.

1181
01:18:03,478 --> 01:18:04,877
# Taught me to kill #

1182
01:18:04,946 --> 01:18:06,504
# Feeling much glee #

1183
01:18:06,581 --> 01:18:08,879
What? No! No!

1184
01:18:10,318 --> 01:18:11,785
God! Ashley!

1185
01:18:11,853 --> 01:18:13,548
Can't breathe...

1186
01:18:13,622 --> 01:18:15,487
What are you doing?!

1187
01:19:53,088 --> 01:19:54,817
Hi, Joel.

1188
01:19:54,890 --> 01:19:56,824
He actually believed it.

1189
01:19:56,892 --> 01:19:58,359
Yeah.

1190
01:19:58,426 --> 01:19:59,552
He thought I was actually dead?

1191
01:19:59,628 --> 01:20:00,560
Yep.

1192
01:20:00,629 --> 01:20:02,494
Fool.

1193
01:20:02,564 --> 01:20:04,759
Never mess with a blue blood.

1194
01:20:04,833 --> 01:20:07,768
We will always outsmart
and outspend you.

1195
01:20:07,836 --> 01:20:08,825
Right, Ash?

1196
01:20:08,904 --> 01:20:10,201
Right.

1197
01:20:10,272 --> 01:20:13,264
Your men found me waiting
on Pirate Island.

1198
01:20:13,341 --> 01:20:14,638
Thanks for the safe passage.

1199
01:20:14,709 --> 01:20:16,870
My pleasure.

1200
01:20:16,945 --> 01:20:21,006
Red skies at night, sailor's delight.

1201
01:20:21,082 --> 01:20:24,245
Red skies at morn,
sailors be warned.

1202
01:20:24,319 --> 01:20:27,447
Tom was easy. Natural predator.

1203
01:20:27,522 --> 01:20:31,117
The crew, helpless. Sitting ducks.

1204
01:20:31,193 --> 01:20:33,787
What some people
will do for love...

1205
01:20:33,862 --> 01:20:36,228
Or should I say your love?

1206
01:20:38,633 --> 01:20:41,625
Sorry about your boat.

1207
01:20:44,072 --> 01:20:46,267
<i>The Interficio
had seen better days...</i>

1208
01:20:46,341 --> 01:20:48,935
I'll get a new one
with my trust fund, anyway.

1209
01:20:49,010 --> 01:20:52,104
Hardest part,
Finding an out of work actor...

1210
01:20:52,180 --> 01:20:53,147
To play the captain.

1211
01:20:53,215 --> 01:20:54,147
I liked him.

1212
01:20:55,450 --> 01:20:58,442
He was good, especially
with that Pirate Island stuff.

1213
01:20:58,520 --> 01:20:59,817
I liked that.

1214
01:20:59,888 --> 01:21:02,083
Then he almost screwed
everything up with Derek...

1215
01:21:02,157 --> 01:21:03,146
Cheap bastard.

1216
01:21:04,226 --> 01:21:05,557
I'm glad Tom gave him
the hook.

1217
01:21:08,029 --> 01:21:10,020
So tell me...

1218
01:21:10,098 --> 01:21:11,725
Hmm?

1219
01:21:13,301 --> 01:21:14,962
Was it all worth it?

1220
01:21:15,036 --> 01:21:18,301
Well, what do you give a gal
that has everything?

1221
01:21:20,008 --> 01:21:22,568
The ability to play God.

1222
01:21:22,644 --> 01:21:24,737
Happy birthday.

1223
01:21:24,813 --> 01:21:27,145
Thank you.

1224
01:21:30,619 --> 01:21:33,144
Though it's not over yet.

1225
01:21:41,563 --> 01:21:43,258
Well, what's next?

1226
01:21:43,331 --> 01:21:45,231
I mean, I have nothing to gain.

1227
01:21:45,300 --> 01:21:46,426
On the contrary.

1228
01:21:46,501 --> 01:21:48,696
I sent the men
from your boat home.

1229
01:21:48,770 --> 01:21:51,261
Your alibi's safe with me.

1230
01:21:51,339 --> 01:21:53,864
No one knows
you were on the boat.

1231
01:21:53,942 --> 01:21:56,502
Now it's just you and me...

1232
01:21:56,578 --> 01:21:58,443
The way it was always
meant to be.

1233
01:22:02,484 --> 01:22:04,918
You want this game to continue.

1234
01:22:04,986 --> 01:22:07,614
Oh, Ash.

1235
01:22:07,689 --> 01:22:11,352
You're smarter than that.
Winner take all.

1236
01:22:11,426 --> 01:22:13,724
Does that scare you?

1237
01:22:15,196 --> 01:22:16,857
Joel?

1238
01:22:16,932 --> 01:22:18,263
Yeah, Ash?

1239
01:22:19,734 --> 01:22:21,793
Have you ever wondered
what it's like...

1240
01:22:21,870 --> 01:22:23,701
To slam your car into a brick wall...

1241
01:22:23,772 --> 01:22:25,262
going 70 miles an hour...

1242
01:22:25,340 --> 01:22:28,366
or to jump out an 80-story window?

1243
01:22:28,443 --> 01:22:30,707
No. Why do you ask?

1244
01:22:34,282 --> 01:22:37,251
You know, I could just
smother you with kisses.

1245
01:22:39,321 --> 01:22:42,085
You want to go some place private?

1246
01:22:42,157 --> 01:22:43,419
Private?

1247
01:22:43,491 --> 01:22:45,789
Yeah. You know...

1248
01:22:45,860 --> 01:22:48,021
Lost, so to speak.

1249
01:22:48,096 --> 01:22:49,620
I thought you would never ask.

1250
01:22:53,902 --> 01:22:56,234
Just...

1251
01:22:56,304 --> 01:22:58,898
don't tell anyone, OK?

1252
01:22:58,974 --> 01:23:00,669
OK.

1253
01:23:10,485 --> 01:23:13,215
# I barely had hair
and killed only three #

1254
01:23:13,288 --> 01:23:16,086
# Filigo, filigo, filigo-ree #

1255
01:23:16,157 --> 01:23:19,593
# The first day out
he gunpowdered me rum #

1256
01:23:19,661 --> 01:23:22,186
# Filigo, filigo, filigo-rum #

1257
01:23:22,263 --> 01:23:25,630
# My timbers did shiver,
my head, it did hum #

1258
01:23:25,700 --> 01:23:28,567
# Filigo, filigo, filigo-rum #

1259
01:23:28,636 --> 01:23:31,503
# He taught me to kill
by feeling much glee #

1260
01:23:31,573 --> 01:23:34,098
# Filigo, filigo, filigo-ree #

1261
01:23:34,175 --> 01:23:37,110
# Man can say little
when he is dead #

1262
01:23:37,178 --> 01:23:39,840
# Filigo, filigo, filigo-red #

1263
01:23:39,914 --> 01:23:41,779
# As we walk hand-in-hand #

1264
01:23:41,850 --> 01:23:44,045
# With old death on the beach #

1265
01:23:44,119 --> 01:23:47,987
# Forever the Black Jack,
says old Mr. Teach #

1266
