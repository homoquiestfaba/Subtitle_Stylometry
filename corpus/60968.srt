1
00:01:06,044 --> 00:01:07,875
You're late!

2
00:01:10,582 --> 00:01:14,074
Can't get her to go to college with
you, but you have to pack her shit.

3
00:01:14,286 --> 00:01:15,719
That’s just pathetic.

4
00:01:20,158 --> 00:01:22,023
He's a big dinosaur now, mom.

5
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:34,195
Pathetic is that you're not even
going out with her anymore...

6
00:01:34,406 --> 00:01:36,306
and you still have to
pack her shit.

7
00:01:46,785 --> 00:01:48,650
You'll always have a room here.

8
00:02:02,801 --> 00:02:03,961
- Bye, honey.
- Bye!

9
00:02:04,169 --> 00:02:06,694
Don't get too busy to
give us a call once in a while.

10
00:02:06,905 --> 00:02:08,395
Bye!

11
00:02:24,489 --> 00:02:26,480
That’s why you're not
dating her anymore.

12
00:02:39,137 --> 00:02:41,002
I forgot something.

13
00:02:45,777 --> 00:02:48,337
- Bye.
- Love you.

14
00:03:09,434 --> 00:03:11,197
Shut up!

15
00:03:24,783 --> 00:03:27,411
- Hello? Where do I sit?
- Right here, babe.

16
00:03:31,423 --> 00:03:34,051
- So where's the party tonight?
- Genius!

17
00:03:34,259 --> 00:03:37,251
- I'm the one going to Harvard.
- So did the Unabomber.

18
00:04:12,931 --> 00:04:15,627
Oh, my God!

19
00:04:20,972 --> 00:04:23,941
We should at least try
to meet people.

20
00:04:24,142 --> 00:04:25,973
Why?

21
00:04:26,611 --> 00:04:27,976
Good question.

22
00:04:34,219 --> 00:04:36,744
She thinks she's hot.
She's not so hot.

23
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:41,752
She really isn't.

24
00:04:56,241 --> 00:04:57,833
Thanks.

25
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:02,678
This is our last night together. Do
you think we can do something else?

26
00:05:02,881 --> 00:05:05,782
- I could probably think of something.
- Yeah?

27
00:05:26,371 --> 00:05:29,863
I am definitely not cut out
for the Greek life.

28
00:05:30,775 --> 00:05:33,175
You'll be all right.

29
00:05:33,378 --> 00:05:36,313
You'll join the swim team,
you'll meet people.

30
00:05:36,514 --> 00:05:39,813
Plus you've got Annie, your
best friend, right here with you.

31
00:05:40,652 --> 00:05:44,554
My best friend will be 2 thousand
miles away, in California.

32
00:05:46,591 --> 00:05:48,252
What are you thinking?

33
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:51,987
I'm picking it up.
Wait! I got it. You're thinking...

34
00:05:52,197 --> 00:05:55,428
I'm thinking... I'm thinking...

35
00:05:56,067 --> 00:05:59,036
I'm thinking
my ass is getting wet!

36
00:06:00,105 --> 00:06:02,733
I knew it was something
about your ass.

37
00:06:07,746 --> 00:06:11,147
I'm going to miss you.
I love being with you.

38
00:06:14,819 --> 00:06:16,810
I miss you already.

39
00:06:17,923 --> 00:06:19,686
Close your eyes.

40
00:06:22,027 --> 00:06:24,393
If you ever want me...

41
00:06:24,596 --> 00:06:26,791
just come to this spot...

42
00:06:27,098 --> 00:06:29,191
and I'll be here.

43
00:06:36,241 --> 00:06:39,108
One last kiss before
they say good-bye.

44
00:06:39,311 --> 00:06:42,337
- I think I'll puke.
- After that, can we go somewhere?

45
00:06:42,547 --> 00:06:45,710
- I want to have some real fun!
- I'm ready for that.

46
00:06:45,917 --> 00:06:47,885
- Let’s go to the club I heard about.
- What club?

47
00:06:48,086 --> 00:06:50,384
I don't know. It’s out of town.
It’s kind of a moving party.

48
00:06:50,588 --> 00:06:52,180
But I can't move.

49
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:57,087
Try not to act like a college boy
because they're not allowed.

50
00:06:59,364 --> 00:07:02,765
Come on, you guys,
let’s do this thing. Come on!

51
00:07:19,884 --> 00:07:21,818
Isn't this great?

52
00:07:24,489 --> 00:07:26,719
I just can't control her anymore.

53
00:07:35,533 --> 00:07:37,125
Look out!

54
00:08:11,403 --> 00:08:13,234
Come on, let’s dance!

55
00:09:01,186 --> 00:09:03,120
I want that blonde tonight.

56
00:09:04,089 --> 00:09:06,523
Look at those ravers.

57
00:09:18,269 --> 00:09:20,032
Come on, let’s go!

58
00:09:23,074 --> 00:09:25,338
Come on, it’s time.
We're doing it!

59
00:09:48,633 --> 00:09:50,533
Get off!

60
00:09:51,069 --> 00:09:53,367
Annie, come on!

61
00:10:14,325 --> 00:10:17,192
There is no light

62
00:10:37,048 --> 00:10:40,506
- This is a church.
- One more minute...

63
00:10:59,204 --> 00:11:03,573
All of a sudden, I feel that we are
making a mistake saying good-bye.

64
00:11:05,977 --> 00:11:08,377
Cassie, you know how I feel.

65
00:11:09,147 --> 00:11:11,581
I don't care how young we are.

66
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:15,485
You're the one I want
to be with, that’s it.

67
00:11:16,221 --> 00:11:18,121
I feel that way too.

68
00:11:19,324 --> 00:11:21,383
So we're lucky.

69
00:11:21,593 --> 00:11:23,823
Most people never find that.

70
00:11:26,297 --> 00:11:28,697
We have our whole lives
ahead of us.

71
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:30,834
Right?

72
00:11:31,836 --> 00:11:33,701
I can wait.

73
00:11:34,539 --> 00:11:36,302
I know what I want.

74
00:11:37,308 --> 00:11:39,367
I love you, Cass.

75
00:11:43,281 --> 00:11:45,476
You've never said that
to me before.

76
00:11:46,317 --> 00:11:48,581
No one's ever said that
to me before.

77
00:11:50,021 --> 00:11:53,821
That makes two of us.
How do you feel?

78
00:11:55,593 --> 00:11:57,720
You know.

79
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:01,426
Is there some reason
you can't say it?

80
00:12:02,066 --> 00:12:03,897
Like what?

81
00:12:05,436 --> 00:12:08,269
Like maybe you're still
thinking about Matt?

82
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,740
No.

83
00:12:11,175 --> 00:12:15,236
No, it’s just...
I don't want to say it and then...

84
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:18,010
have you leave me tomorrow.

85
00:12:20,985 --> 00:12:23,749
- Okay.
- But I feel it.

86
00:12:24,722 --> 00:12:27,555
Maybe tonight you should
tell me how you feel.

87
00:12:30,428 --> 00:12:31,520
I...

88
00:12:41,339 --> 00:12:44,240
- What are you doing out here, man?
- Drinking.

89
00:12:44,942 --> 00:12:48,742
I was going to go get Annabel,
but now I think I'm going to...

90
00:12:50,448 --> 00:12:52,211
Right.

91
00:12:52,717 --> 00:12:54,912
All right. I'll get her.

92
00:12:56,187 --> 00:12:59,748
It’s freezing out here.
Can you unlock it?

93
00:12:59,957 --> 00:13:03,916
Here. Warm it up.
You're driving.

94
00:13:09,434 --> 00:13:12,335
The darkness is here!

95
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:36,559
Harvard laid our serious financial aid
for the brain cells you're trashing.

96
00:13:38,162 --> 00:13:42,121
They're still my brain cells.
They don't know me yet.

97
00:13:44,836 --> 00:13:48,294
Besides, I lied.
I'm not really drunk.

98
00:13:55,747 --> 00:13:56,907
I'll miss you.

99
00:13:58,549 --> 00:13:59,777
Sorry.

100
00:14:00,318 --> 00:14:02,252
It’s not very fair, is it?

101
00:14:05,289 --> 00:14:07,484
You know, Matt...

102
00:14:07,692 --> 00:14:10,490
...I care for you, but then...
- Please.

103
00:14:10,695 --> 00:14:13,493
Not the "I care for you,
but..." speech.

104
00:14:13,698 --> 00:14:16,599
I got that last summer, remember?

105
00:14:16,801 --> 00:14:18,359
Yeah.

106
00:14:18,569 --> 00:14:22,403
- I guess I'm just a bad loser.
- It’s not a competition.

107
00:14:24,842 --> 00:14:26,503
Right.

108
00:14:28,012 --> 00:14:29,980
Right.

109
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:36,211
Well, I'll settle for nothing less
than friends for life.

110
00:14:37,155 --> 00:14:40,420
- Deal.
- And one last kiss.

111
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:44,823
I'm sorry. I won't end the most
meaningful relationship of my life...

112
00:14:45,029 --> 00:14:47,156
with a lousy handshake.

113
00:14:47,498 --> 00:14:49,693
I'm not a business man.

114
00:14:51,636 --> 00:14:54,366
All right, forget it.
I'm sorry I asked.

115
00:14:57,742 --> 00:15:00,711
You know, sometimes
you can be a real shit.

116
00:15:06,818 --> 00:15:09,946
2O years from now,
when you and Sean are married...

117
00:15:10,154 --> 00:15:14,386
and you're a mom with your rug rat
children in your suburban home...

118
00:15:14,592 --> 00:15:17,925
do you think it will really matter
whether we shook hands or kissed...

119
00:15:18,129 --> 00:15:20,359
the night we said good-bye?

120
00:15:22,767 --> 00:15:28,228
One last good-bye forever,
my former love.

121
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:31,365
A kiss.

122
00:15:33,344 --> 00:15:35,642
And it 's in the past...

123
00:15:56,901 --> 00:15:59,335
What a cold rain!

124
00:16:01,906 --> 00:16:03,737
Sean!

125
00:16:04,141 --> 00:16:06,132
- Where did you guys go?
- Nowhere.

126
00:16:06,344 --> 00:16:09,836
- Sean, it 's not what you're thinking.
- Really? What am I thinking?

127
00:16:10,047 --> 00:16:13,312
Matt just...
We were just talking, and he...

128
00:16:13,518 --> 00:16:16,510
- Did you have fun?
- Oh, yeah. You?

129
00:16:17,088 --> 00:16:20,182
Sean, don't walk away
from me, please!

130
00:16:20,391 --> 00:16:22,188
Sean?

131
00:16:24,495 --> 00:16:26,395
Look, it was nothing!

132
00:16:26,631 --> 00:16:28,326
I'm sorry!

133
00:16:28,533 --> 00:16:31,366
If it was nothing,
why are you sorry?

134
00:16:35,239 --> 00:16:38,299
Sean, please, talk to me.

135
00:16:46,284 --> 00:16:48,548
Hello? What 's the drama?

136
00:16:49,253 --> 00:16:51,585
Yeah, Cass, tell Annabel
what the drama is.

137
00:16:51,789 --> 00:16:54,781
Come on, it 's freezing back here.
Come on.

138
00:16:55,426 --> 00:16:57,826
Let’s go! It 's freezing!

139
00:17:20,484 --> 00:17:24,079
I know what it looked like, but
believe me, it 's not what you think!

140
00:17:24,855 --> 00:17:27,050
Cassie, watch the road.

141
00:17:41,639 --> 00:17:44,039
Will you talk to me?

142
00:17:44,241 --> 00:17:45,230
Oh, my God! Cassie!

143
00:17:47,411 --> 00:17:48,673
Cassie, break!

144
00:18:10,267 --> 00:18:12,258
Can you hear me? Hello?

145
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:14,631
Anybody in there,
can you hear me?

146
00:18:17,842 --> 00:18:20,572
How much did you
have to drink tonight?

147
00:18:26,684 --> 00:18:27,981
Watch it now.

148
00:18:39,063 --> 00:18:42,965
The loss of a young life
is a most terrible thing.

149
00:18:47,772 --> 00:18:50,434
...our beloved Sean will...

150
00:18:51,642 --> 00:18:53,837
...for we have loved...

151
00:19:15,232 --> 00:19:17,700
Matt 's taking me back to school.

152
00:19:18,436 --> 00:19:20,700
Why don't you come with us?

153
00:19:21,305 --> 00:19:23,569
I'm not sure I'm going back.

154
00:19:39,757 --> 00:19:43,591
All right, class, remember.
This coming midterm, we'll...

155
00:19:45,096 --> 00:19:47,656
Are you still
thinking about Matt?

156
00:19:50,835 --> 00:19:53,736
Maybe tonight you should
tell me how you feel.

157
00:19:55,773 --> 00:19:57,741
Cassandra?

158
00:19:58,476 --> 00:20:00,376
Cassandra?

159
00:20:00,778 --> 00:20:02,643
This test is critical.

160
00:20:13,157 --> 00:20:14,556
Hey, excuse me.

161
00:20:15,126 --> 00:20:17,822
I wasn't here last week.
Do you have a study guide?

162
00:20:18,095 --> 00:20:19,562
Sorry.

163
00:20:25,336 --> 00:20:27,896
How much did you
have to drink tonight?

164
00:20:38,949 --> 00:20:42,248
If you ever want me,
just come right here to this spot...

165
00:20:44,221 --> 00:20:47,247
Just come to this spot,
and I'll be here.

166
00:21:31,135 --> 00:21:32,762
Hello.

167
00:22:30,661 --> 00:22:33,494
Maybe tonight you should
tell me how you feel.

168
00:22:41,372 --> 00:22:43,397
I love you, Cassie.

169
00:23:09,433 --> 00:23:11,128
Cassie!

170
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:38,960
I've been out there pounding!
It took me 5 minutes to try the door.

171
00:23:43,233 --> 00:23:44,996
Hello?

172
00:23:49,907 --> 00:23:52,068
You look like shit.

173
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:59,977
- What have they got you on?
- It 's for headaches.

174
00:24:01,085 --> 00:24:02,916
Zombie food!

175
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,886
Lovely, lovely.
You're not going like that, are you?

176
00:24:08,325 --> 00:24:10,054
Going where?

177
00:24:10,761 --> 00:24:13,924
To the club! Don't you remember?

178
00:24:14,698 --> 00:24:17,599
God, Cass! We've got
to get you ready, girl!

179
00:24:18,602 --> 00:24:21,162
I have to study.
I have a midterm.

180
00:24:22,072 --> 00:24:24,438
Everybody has a midterm.

181
00:24:24,641 --> 00:24:26,131
Cass...

182
00:24:29,646 --> 00:24:32,080
You remember when my mom died?

183
00:24:32,282 --> 00:24:34,182
And went into, like...

184
00:24:34,385 --> 00:24:37,946
this black hole and...

185
00:24:38,322 --> 00:24:40,347
If it wasn't for you...

186
00:24:41,225 --> 00:24:44,023
You've got to
get out of here, girl!

187
00:24:44,228 --> 00:24:46,253
Join the living!

188
00:24:59,777 --> 00:25:02,837
This is my friend, Raven.

189
00:25:03,147 --> 00:25:04,978
Hello.

190
00:25:05,182 --> 00:25:08,174
- Hi.
- I've got to pee.

191
00:25:14,458 --> 00:25:16,255
Who's this?

192
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:20,021
He was my boyfriend.
He died three weeks ago.

193
00:25:28,072 --> 00:25:31,098
He's here now... Sean.

194
00:25:45,389 --> 00:25:47,448
Inside you and Matt...

195
00:25:48,792 --> 00:25:50,919
in the car that night...

196
00:25:54,231 --> 00:25:56,290
He's afraid.

197
00:25:58,302 --> 00:26:00,668
You're in trouble!

198
00:26:10,047 --> 00:26:12,015
So, are you coming?

199
00:26:12,216 --> 00:26:14,844
- No.
- Cass?

200
00:26:15,052 --> 00:26:18,453
- Just go, okay?
- You wanted to meet people!

201
00:26:18,889 --> 00:26:20,982
I'll call you later.

202
00:27:19,883 --> 00:27:21,908
Don't run, baby!

203
00:27:29,193 --> 00:27:30,558
You're mine, baby!

204
00:27:30,761 --> 00:27:32,388
Cassie!

205
00:27:34,565 --> 00:27:36,465
Hold on, Cassie!

206
00:27:48,078 --> 00:27:49,602
Cassie!

207
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:14,597
Hey.

208
00:28:14,871 --> 00:28:17,305
Welcome back to the world.

209
00:28:17,741 --> 00:28:19,538
What happened?

210
00:28:19,876 --> 00:28:22,674
You fainted.
Some priest brought you here.

211
00:28:22,879 --> 00:28:26,645
He was walking around outside
like somebody died. Scared me.

212
00:28:27,517 --> 00:28:30,281
I'm supposed to keep
an eye on you. It sucks, but...

213
00:28:30,487 --> 00:28:32,978
somebody's got to do it.
Not me.

214
00:28:37,527 --> 00:28:39,358
What about Harvard?

215
00:28:39,896 --> 00:28:42,524
It will be there when I get back.

216
00:28:44,568 --> 00:28:47,128
The doctor said you can go...

217
00:28:47,337 --> 00:28:50,272
but they want you
to come back to do some tests...

218
00:28:50,474 --> 00:28:53,807
to make sure it has nothing to do
with your injury from the accident.

219
00:28:54,011 --> 00:28:57,037
- Is there something wrong?
- They're just covering their asses.

220
00:28:57,247 --> 00:28:59,909
You know doctors.
They love tests.

221
00:29:00,484 --> 00:29:02,418
Well, I hate tests.

222
00:29:18,435 --> 00:29:22,030
I borrowed your keys
and I did a little shopping.

223
00:29:25,409 --> 00:29:27,274
That 's incredible!

224
00:29:27,477 --> 00:29:29,342
You're so sweet.

225
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:33,611
- And there.
- Thank you so much.

226
00:29:40,991 --> 00:29:44,449
I talked to Annie.
She said you're not doing so well.

227
00:29:44,695 --> 00:29:48,222
- Do you want to talk about it?
- He shouldn't have died that night.

228
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:02,201
It 's not your fault.

229
00:30:02,512 --> 00:30:06,278
Yeah... I think that
it was our fault.

230
00:30:07,384 --> 00:30:10,478
Because if it wasn't for us then
Sean and I wouldn't have fought...

231
00:30:10,787 --> 00:30:13,119
and I wouldn't have
lost control of the car!

232
00:30:13,323 --> 00:30:15,314
Those guys we hit were trashed.

233
00:30:15,525 --> 00:30:18,858
They did a18O right in front of us.
There's no way you could've stopped.

234
00:30:19,129 --> 00:30:21,461
There's no way
anyone could've stopped.

235
00:30:21,665 --> 00:30:24,828
Matt, it 's not that I miss him.

236
00:30:26,536 --> 00:30:28,504
I saw him!

237
00:30:30,073 --> 00:30:31,836
You saw him?

238
00:30:33,210 --> 00:30:36,270
- Tell me exactly what happened.
- I was running...

239
00:30:36,913 --> 00:30:39,643
and someone put their hand
on my shoulder...

240
00:30:39,850 --> 00:30:42,944
and they turned me around,
they said my name...

241
00:30:43,487 --> 00:30:46,320
- It was him.
- Why were you running?

242
00:30:46,523 --> 00:30:49,458
Do you remember that guy
from the club that night?

243
00:30:49,726 --> 00:30:52,786
The one that grabbed me
when me and Annie were dancing?

244
00:30:52,996 --> 00:30:56,124
- Yeah, you shoved him.
- He's here, he's on campus!

245
00:30:56,333 --> 00:30:58,699
No, he's not, Cassie.
Sean isn't either.

246
00:31:01,338 --> 00:31:03,203
You know that, don't you?

247
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:06,004
You could've died that night too!

248
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:11,308
- But I didn't, did I?
- No, and you feel guilty about that.

249
00:31:13,283 --> 00:31:16,047
- What about school?
- I'm not going anywhere.

250
00:31:16,253 --> 00:31:20,280
But Harvard is, like,
your life, you know...

251
00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:23,425
that 's all that matters to you,
it always has been.

252
00:31:23,627 --> 00:31:25,595
You're all that matters now.

253
00:31:55,459 --> 00:31:58,087
Shit!

254
00:32:33,930 --> 00:32:36,228
Hello? What's the drama?

255
00:32:37,434 --> 00:32:39,664
Cassie, watch the road.

256
00:32:42,239 --> 00:32:45,140
- It's included.
- What's the cranial pulse?

257
00:33:30,153 --> 00:33:31,518
Well, Cassandra...

258
00:33:31,955 --> 00:33:34,856
the tests indicate
you have a hemorrhage.

259
00:33:35,058 --> 00:33:38,289
We're going to relieve the pressure
on the right part of your brain.

260
00:33:38,495 --> 00:33:40,895
I want you to breathe normally...

261
00:33:41,531 --> 00:33:44,295
and count back from 1OO.

262
00:34:22,172 --> 00:34:24,163
Feeling better?

263
00:34:25,942 --> 00:34:27,876
You're the one that saved me.

264
00:34:28,111 --> 00:34:29,942
You're the priest?

265
00:34:30,246 --> 00:34:33,215
I try not to wear my collar
when I'm around here.

266
00:34:33,416 --> 00:34:36,010
I do volunteer counseling
once a week.

267
00:34:36,219 --> 00:34:37,982
My name is Jude.

268
00:34:38,755 --> 00:34:40,723
- Cassie.
- Hi.

269
00:34:42,058 --> 00:34:46,154
I've got a minute before my next
appointment. You want to sit down?

270
00:34:46,429 --> 00:34:48,192
Sure.

271
00:34:54,270 --> 00:34:56,261
So...

272
00:34:57,807 --> 00:35:01,971
Do I call you "father"?
I'm sort of a lapsed Catholic.

273
00:35:02,112 --> 00:35:05,275
I think all Catholics lapse
once in a while.

274
00:35:05,782 --> 00:35:08,842
Probably especially
during midterms.

275
00:35:11,655 --> 00:35:13,520
Yeah...

276
00:35:16,259 --> 00:35:19,353
I've sort of been having
a rough time, actually.

277
00:35:21,231 --> 00:35:23,631
I lost my boyfriend recently.

278
00:35:26,736 --> 00:35:28,829
Can I ask what happened?

279
00:35:31,174 --> 00:35:33,108
Car accident.

280
00:35:34,477 --> 00:35:36,308
I was driving.

281
00:35:39,249 --> 00:35:44,312
It was really sudden, and there was
something that I wanted to tell him.

282
00:35:44,721 --> 00:35:46,655
But I never got the chance.

283
00:35:48,825 --> 00:35:50,554
It 's...

284
00:35:51,194 --> 00:35:55,756
difficult to be a survivor.
But you've got to remember...

285
00:35:55,965 --> 00:35:59,264
that it 's up to God
who lives and who dies.

286
00:36:02,038 --> 00:36:05,303
I know it sounds crazy, but...

287
00:36:05,508 --> 00:36:08,534
sometimes I feel like
he's still here with me.

288
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:12,510
I mean, really here.

289
00:36:12,716 --> 00:36:14,809
Like he's not gone yet.

290
00:36:16,953 --> 00:36:19,478
Maybe he is still with you.

291
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:26,125
Oh, that 's my friend.

292
00:36:26,429 --> 00:36:28,158
I've got to go.

293
00:36:28,865 --> 00:36:32,892
Well, feel free to come by anytime.
You're going to be okay.

294
00:36:33,770 --> 00:36:36,261
- All right.
- Bye!

295
00:36:49,919 --> 00:36:51,580
Hey!

296
00:36:51,788 --> 00:36:54,848
- Didn't mean to interrupt confession.
- You didn't.

297
00:36:55,558 --> 00:36:57,651
Come here,
I want to show you something.

298
00:36:58,061 --> 00:37:00,029
Come on, come on.

299
00:37:00,263 --> 00:37:04,324
Alright. You can kick
all their asses at the free style.

300
00:37:05,468 --> 00:37:06,901
Matt...

301
00:37:07,103 --> 00:37:10,004
I just want to see you
in a bathing suit again.

302
00:37:10,874 --> 00:37:12,967
Come on, I've got another idea.

303
00:37:42,672 --> 00:37:44,572
It was about time!

304
00:37:45,708 --> 00:37:47,437
We saved you a roller.

305
00:37:47,644 --> 00:37:49,578
I'm a brush chick.

306
00:37:51,614 --> 00:37:53,138
Here.

307
00:38:33,389 --> 00:38:36,415
There's more paint on my shirt
than you have on your walls!

308
00:38:39,562 --> 00:38:41,325
Here.

309
00:38:41,531 --> 00:38:43,556
Oh, my gosh.

310
00:38:45,001 --> 00:38:48,232
- So how's Raven?
- Interesting.

311
00:38:48,438 --> 00:38:51,498
- Talks about you a lot.
- He does?

312
00:38:52,442 --> 00:38:54,808
Raven thinks you're not
really here with us.

313
00:38:55,011 --> 00:38:57,343
He says you're still
kind of with Sean.

314
00:38:57,547 --> 00:38:59,742
Maybe I am a little.

315
00:39:01,651 --> 00:39:04,051
Do you feel that way too?

316
00:39:04,254 --> 00:39:07,417
You know how I feel
more than anything?

317
00:39:07,957 --> 00:39:11,620
That I'm finally free. We're on
our own for the first time, Cass.

318
00:39:11,828 --> 00:39:15,229
We can do anything,
no boundaries.

319
00:39:15,498 --> 00:39:17,261
Don't you feel that way?

320
00:39:17,467 --> 00:39:19,230
I wish I did.

321
00:39:19,736 --> 00:39:21,226
Don't worry.

322
00:39:21,437 --> 00:39:23,837
We'll get you there, Cass.

323
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:53,526
Cassie?
Cassie, what is it?

324
00:39:53,736 --> 00:39:56,227
Cassie, it 's okay!
What happened?

325
00:39:56,673 --> 00:39:58,800
It 's okay!

326
00:39:59,575 --> 00:40:01,668
It 's nothing, sweetie.

327
00:40:07,550 --> 00:40:08,847
Hey.

328
00:40:09,052 --> 00:40:11,748
- What are you doing?
- We're going out, right?

329
00:40:11,955 --> 00:40:14,014
Because I feel like dancing.

330
00:40:14,390 --> 00:40:18,087
- We said we'd stay in tonight.
- Yeah, well, now...

331
00:40:18,294 --> 00:40:20,125
I want to go out.

332
00:40:31,007 --> 00:40:33,498
Fine. I'll see you guys later.

333
00:40:34,777 --> 00:40:36,904
Matt, let her go.
I want to sleep.

334
00:40:37,113 --> 00:40:39,104
Why are you doing this?

335
00:40:49,258 --> 00:40:51,123
Is everything okay?

336
00:41:28,197 --> 00:41:30,131
Hey, there.

337
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:34,830
I miss you. I'm sorry.

338
00:41:35,038 --> 00:41:38,496
- It 's okay. Just hang in there.
- I want you.

339
00:41:51,921 --> 00:41:53,684
Make love to me!

340
00:42:17,346 --> 00:42:19,246
Matt?

341
00:42:23,319 --> 00:42:25,014
Hey.

342
00:42:25,421 --> 00:42:28,857
What 's wrong? You don't look so
good. I'm going to get your pills.

343
00:42:52,115 --> 00:42:55,812
- We didn't... Tell me we didn't...
- What?

344
00:42:56,018 --> 00:42:58,851
Tell me we didn't sleep
together last night.

345
00:43:00,256 --> 00:43:02,121
You don't remember?

346
00:43:02,592 --> 00:43:04,184
No.

347
00:43:05,027 --> 00:43:08,155
- What happened?
- You said you missed me, that you...

348
00:43:08,431 --> 00:43:10,262
What?

349
00:43:17,306 --> 00:43:19,274
Annie?

350
00:43:19,575 --> 00:43:21,634
Hi.

351
00:43:26,716 --> 00:43:29,742
- Okay, I get it.
- No, Annie, it 's not what you think!

352
00:43:29,952 --> 00:43:31,943
Stop it, Cass!

353
00:43:32,155 --> 00:43:35,386
I'm quicker than that.
Not as quick as you, though.

354
00:43:35,591 --> 00:43:38,560
- Annie, let me just...
- Let me talk to her.

355
00:43:40,530 --> 00:43:42,054
Sudden, don't you think?

356
00:43:42,331 --> 00:43:45,232
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- It 's not what you think...

357
00:43:45,434 --> 00:43:47,629
I can't even believe you.
Get away from me.

358
00:44:13,629 --> 00:44:15,153
Hi.

359
00:44:18,601 --> 00:44:20,694
Cassie?

360
00:44:22,171 --> 00:44:25,265
Listen to me. I can't talk to you
if you're afraid.

361
00:44:25,908 --> 00:44:30,345
If you want me to leave you alone,
I will. I'm not going to haunt you.

362
00:44:31,214 --> 00:44:33,205
This can't be happening!

363
00:44:36,819 --> 00:44:38,753
You came here...

364
00:44:39,355 --> 00:44:42,051
because I said
that I would be here.

365
00:44:43,326 --> 00:44:45,260
So here I am.

366
00:44:49,365 --> 00:44:51,094
It 's okay.

367
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:01,640
It 's really you.

368
00:45:04,947 --> 00:45:06,539
I miss you.

369
00:45:08,684 --> 00:45:10,515
It 's okay.

370
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:12,449
Come on.

371
00:45:32,241 --> 00:45:34,175
I must really be crazy.

372
00:45:36,679 --> 00:45:38,647
You're not crazy.

373
00:45:38,848 --> 00:45:40,839
I'm here.

374
00:45:49,191 --> 00:45:52,285
Don't let go, don't let go.

375
00:45:54,697 --> 00:45:56,597
Come with me.

376
00:45:59,802 --> 00:46:01,269
Where?

377
00:46:03,406 --> 00:46:05,738
Away from here.

378
00:46:06,409 --> 00:46:09,276
The guys are going to
keep tracing you.

379
00:46:11,213 --> 00:46:14,148
Cassie?
I want you with me!

380
00:46:20,256 --> 00:46:22,121
Do you love me?

381
00:46:22,325 --> 00:46:24,316
I don't want to die!

382
00:46:24,860 --> 00:46:28,227
If you stay here,
you're going to die.

383
00:46:32,335 --> 00:46:33,324
Cassie.

384
00:46:33,869 --> 00:46:35,803
Cassie!

385
00:47:06,902 --> 00:47:08,733
I've been looking all over for you.

386
00:47:08,938 --> 00:47:10,769
Cassie, let me explain.

387
00:47:10,973 --> 00:47:13,965
Look, you called out,
you said you missed me...

388
00:47:14,176 --> 00:47:17,805
and that you wanted me to be there.
You said, "Make love to me".

389
00:47:25,988 --> 00:47:28,422
I thought you had
feelings for me again.

390
00:47:28,624 --> 00:47:31,092
I'm so sorry, Cassie.
I was wrong.

391
00:47:31,293 --> 00:47:33,887
Tell me how I can make it up
for you. I'll do anything.

392
00:47:34,096 --> 00:47:36,963
I just need to be alone
for a while.

393
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:39,765
Cassie?

394
00:47:39,969 --> 00:47:42,233
I just need some time.

395
00:49:22,338 --> 00:49:24,203
Annie!

396
00:51:05,908 --> 00:51:08,672
- What 's wrong?
- This guy was...

397
00:51:08,877 --> 00:51:11,277
This guy was chasing me.
He was trying to...

398
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:13,948
- Who was chasing you?
- I don't know.

399
00:51:14,149 --> 00:51:16,982
I think it was one of those
weird guys from the club.

400
00:51:17,186 --> 00:51:21,145
He had a scar on his face,
and he had long hair...

401
00:51:21,790 --> 00:51:25,817
- Oh, God, I was so scared.
- All right, you're in a safe place.

402
00:51:26,195 --> 00:51:28,254
You don't believe me!

403
00:51:28,464 --> 00:51:32,457
I'm worried about you, Cassie.
I think you should talk to someone.

404
00:51:33,435 --> 00:51:37,064
You think I'm crazy?
I am not crazy! Everyone else is!

405
00:51:37,406 --> 00:51:39,704
Nobody is chasing you, Cass.

406
00:51:41,110 --> 00:51:44,238
I saw what I saw.
Why don't you believe me?

407
00:51:47,383 --> 00:51:49,613
I believe you believe it.

408
00:51:49,818 --> 00:51:52,548
But I also think you haven't
accepted what 's happened yet.

409
00:51:52,755 --> 00:51:56,350
So it 's like it 's still happening
to you in your head.

410
00:51:57,159 --> 00:51:59,093
I want to help.

411
00:52:08,037 --> 00:52:10,062
I love you.

412
00:52:10,305 --> 00:52:12,364
- Matt, I don't...
- No, it 's okay.

413
00:52:12,574 --> 00:52:14,804
You don't have to love me back.

414
00:52:15,210 --> 00:52:17,576
Just let me take care of you.

415
00:52:23,018 --> 00:52:25,452
I'm going to go get your medicine.

416
00:52:40,069 --> 00:52:45,632
Hi, mom, it 's me. Can you call me
as soon as you can? I need to talk.

417
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:53,471
How did you get in here?

418
00:52:54,349 --> 00:52:57,512
I copied your key while
you were in the hospital. Here.

419
00:53:02,257 --> 00:53:04,384
You need to get some rest.

420
00:54:00,215 --> 00:54:03,150
There were two girls in the locker
room. They didn't see anybody.

421
00:54:03,352 --> 00:54:06,446
Do you always get here
before everyone else?

422
00:54:06,655 --> 00:54:10,455
No, I'm trying to get my time down.
I have first meets Thursday.

423
00:54:10,926 --> 00:54:14,157
You had a pretty serious head injury
in that car accident, didn't you?

424
00:54:39,955 --> 00:54:43,118
Dr. Haverston?
Excuse me.

425
00:54:43,458 --> 00:54:47,326
Hi. Why wasn't my grade
posted with the others?

426
00:54:47,529 --> 00:54:50,327
There is no grade
for this kind of test.

427
00:54:52,434 --> 00:54:54,425
- Wait!
- Cassie.

428
00:54:55,637 --> 00:54:57,571
Cassie?

429
00:55:30,239 --> 00:55:31,866
Cassie?

430
00:55:34,776 --> 00:55:36,971
Come in, come in.

431
00:55:45,020 --> 00:55:46,885
Sit down.

432
00:55:49,191 --> 00:55:51,159
Let 's see now...

433
00:55:52,261 --> 00:55:54,252
What 's wrong?

434
00:55:54,997 --> 00:55:56,897
Everything.

435
00:55:57,566 --> 00:55:59,625
Everything's wrong.

436
00:56:00,502 --> 00:56:03,198
I don't know
what 's happening to me.

437
00:56:04,873 --> 00:56:08,502
You feel alone in a world
that you don't understand.

438
00:56:08,710 --> 00:56:10,940
You don't know who to trust.

439
00:56:11,146 --> 00:56:14,274
But you're trying
very hard, I know that.

440
00:56:16,551 --> 00:56:18,451
How do you know?

441
00:56:18,687 --> 00:56:21,713
Because you're not
the first person to be here.

442
00:56:22,591 --> 00:56:27,255
And I promise you, that whatever
happens, you'll find your way.

443
00:56:27,462 --> 00:56:29,657
You just have to be strong.

444
00:56:31,667 --> 00:56:34,067
I don't want to be strong.

445
00:56:35,103 --> 00:56:37,071
I'm so tired.

446
00:56:37,272 --> 00:56:40,241
Lie back, Cassie.
Try and rest.

447
00:56:40,842 --> 00:56:44,744
I want you to have something.
This is Saint Jude...

448
00:56:44,947 --> 00:56:48,542
one of those guys that they made
you learn about in Sunday school.

449
00:56:48,750 --> 00:56:51,082
He looked after people
that were lost...

450
00:56:51,286 --> 00:56:54,517
and that 's who
my father named me after.

451
00:57:01,296 --> 00:57:03,389
I'm so tired.

452
00:57:06,535 --> 00:57:08,435
Rest.

453
00:57:13,008 --> 00:57:14,532
Thank you.

454
00:58:33,321 --> 00:58:36,916
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, I'm looking for Jude.

455
00:58:37,125 --> 00:58:39,593
- Who?
- A priest.

456
00:58:39,795 --> 00:58:42,059
I don't know his full name. Jude?

457
00:58:42,264 --> 00:58:45,893
- Father Jude?
- Yeah, do you know where he is?

458
00:58:46,568 --> 00:58:48,365
Sit down.

459
00:58:50,138 --> 00:58:53,904
- I really can't stay.
- Are you a member of the church?

460
00:58:54,276 --> 00:58:58,178
No, I met Jude when
I started school this fall.

461
00:58:58,814 --> 00:59:00,805
Is there something wrong?

462
00:59:01,750 --> 00:59:03,980
I can't stay.
I really need to find him.

463
00:59:04,186 --> 00:59:06,245
- What 's your name?
- Cassie.

464
00:59:06,521 --> 00:59:09,422
Well, Cassie, perhaps there's
been some confusion, but...

465
00:59:09,624 --> 00:59:14,584
Father Jude was head of the church
here until he passed away in 1981.

466
00:59:16,064 --> 00:59:17,964
I don't understand.

467
00:59:18,166 --> 00:59:20,828
Well, I don't either.

468
00:59:21,536 --> 00:59:24,733
It must be a different priest.
I need to find him. I'm in trouble.

469
00:59:25,006 --> 00:59:28,999
Maybe there's something I can
help you with, Cassie. But first...

470
00:59:29,211 --> 00:59:31,076
I really need to know
if you're a member.

471
00:59:32,214 --> 00:59:34,375
What the hell are you doing?

472
00:59:41,156 --> 00:59:43,624
Go, Cassie! Let 's do it!

473
01:00:25,433 --> 01:00:27,993
Hang in there, Cass!
You're going to make it!

474
01:00:37,846 --> 01:00:39,905
All right, Cassie!

475
01:00:48,223 --> 01:00:50,248
Incredible!

476
01:00:51,259 --> 01:00:54,387
You looked like you were in trouble,
but you pulled it on. Nicely done.

477
01:00:54,596 --> 01:00:57,156
Yeah! What got into you?

478
01:00:59,401 --> 01:01:01,130
I saw Sean.

479
01:01:04,206 --> 01:01:07,141
And that guy with the mask
from the club.

480
01:01:07,342 --> 01:01:10,038
- What guy?
- And the one with a scarred face.

481
01:01:10,312 --> 01:01:13,907
I saw you talking with him.
He went back there.

482
01:01:14,683 --> 01:01:16,651
What do you guys do there?

483
01:01:19,521 --> 01:01:23,355
- What 's going on?
- Nothing's going on. Take it easy.

484
01:01:23,558 --> 01:01:26,618
I did go back. I went back to tell
those guys to leave you alone.

485
01:01:26,828 --> 01:01:29,194
Yeah, but I saw him
at school with you.

486
01:01:29,397 --> 01:01:31,524
You're paranoid.
You're hallucinating.

487
01:01:31,733 --> 01:01:34,668
And I saw you with Raven
that day at school and...

488
01:01:34,869 --> 01:01:37,394
That 's it, okay?
We've got to get you out of here.

489
01:01:37,606 --> 01:01:40,302
We'll hop in the car, drive you to
your folks. We'll drive all night.

490
01:01:40,875 --> 01:01:42,308
No.

491
01:01:42,510 --> 01:01:46,947
Come on! We'll make a little
road trip out of it. It will be fun.

492
01:01:47,148 --> 01:01:49,309
I'm not going anywhere with you.

493
01:01:50,885 --> 01:01:55,219
This whole thing with Sean is
screwed up. You're screwed up.

494
01:01:55,423 --> 01:01:58,085
Let us help you, Cass.
Just come with us.

495
01:01:59,828 --> 01:02:00,920
No.

496
01:02:01,263 --> 01:02:05,324
Sean's not coming back! You want to
be with us or with him somewhere?

497
01:02:05,533 --> 01:02:08,001
- Take it easy.
- I'm sick of waiting for you to decide.

498
01:02:08,203 --> 01:02:10,103
You're with us or you're not!

499
01:02:11,673 --> 01:02:14,608
- What is that supposed to mean?
- It doesn't mean anything.

500
01:02:14,809 --> 01:02:18,370
You want to stay here, don't you?
That way you get it all, I mean...

501
01:02:18,580 --> 01:02:23,449
you get Sean, Matt and you get
everything, and we don't get shit!

502
01:02:23,718 --> 01:02:25,015
That 's enough!

503
01:02:25,220 --> 01:02:27,848
- Raven was so right about you.
- Stop it!

504
01:02:29,157 --> 01:02:33,253
Look, I know you're angry at me
about Matt and about Sean...

505
01:02:33,995 --> 01:02:36,964
- Please...
- People from the club are dangerous.

506
01:02:38,900 --> 01:02:41,869
- Those people?
- One of them tried to kill me!

507
01:02:42,203 --> 01:02:44,194
Isn't that ironic?

508
01:02:44,439 --> 01:02:46,134
What?

509
01:02:47,108 --> 01:02:48,905
You're the murderer.

510
01:02:52,681 --> 01:02:54,012
Cassie!

511
01:02:54,215 --> 01:02:58,379
- Annie! Oh, God, I'm so sorry!
- You're going to die.

512
01:02:58,586 --> 01:03:01,054
Annabel! Let 's go!

513
01:03:07,295 --> 01:03:09,195
Trick or treat!

514
01:03:13,301 --> 01:03:15,235
Let 's go.

515
01:03:15,437 --> 01:03:18,304
I need to go back and get my stuff,
and then I'm going home.

516
01:03:18,506 --> 01:03:20,269
Okay, I'll drive you
to your parents.

517
01:03:23,111 --> 01:03:26,603
- I'll be right out.
- I won't let anybody in.

518
01:03:40,995 --> 01:03:42,792
Matt?

519
01:03:43,598 --> 01:03:45,190
Matt?

520
01:03:50,405 --> 01:03:52,202
Hello?

521
01:04:35,850 --> 01:04:37,215
Got you!

522
01:05:37,479 --> 01:05:40,039
Wait. Come back!
Cassie, are you okay?

523
01:05:41,015 --> 01:05:43,711
Wait, it 's me. It 's me.
It 's okay!

524
01:05:45,954 --> 01:05:50,254
He tried to kill me.
He's back there and he's dead.

525
01:05:50,458 --> 01:05:53,655
- What is it?
- I killed him. He's in the water.

526
01:05:54,128 --> 01:05:56,790
What are you talking about?
I was just up there.

527
01:05:56,998 --> 01:06:00,161
There's nobody up there.
I promise.

528
01:06:00,368 --> 01:06:03,166
I promise,
there's nobody up there.

529
01:06:03,471 --> 01:06:06,031
Come on.
There's nobody up there.

530
01:06:06,241 --> 01:06:08,004
Come on!

531
01:06:10,345 --> 01:06:12,313
There's no one out here.

532
01:06:18,052 --> 01:06:19,747
He was here.

533
01:06:19,954 --> 01:06:21,945
He was right there!

534
01:06:31,099 --> 01:06:32,828
Take me home.

535
01:06:33,034 --> 01:06:35,002
Take me home to my mom.

536
01:06:36,104 --> 01:06:38,868
Come on. Come on.

537
01:06:39,073 --> 01:06:40,836
Come on. Come on.

538
01:06:54,289 --> 01:06:57,053
What are we doing here?
You said you'd take me home!

539
01:06:57,258 --> 01:07:00,455
I am, take it easy. I'm just going to
go get Annabel. Then we can go.

540
01:07:00,662 --> 01:07:02,653
I'm not leaving her here.

541
01:07:03,431 --> 01:07:05,831
- I'm not going in there.
- Fine. Stay in the car.

542
01:07:17,879 --> 01:07:19,369
Wait!

543
01:07:52,080 --> 01:07:53,707
Matt!

544
01:08:56,744 --> 01:08:58,575
Welcome to the party, Cass.

545
01:09:00,615 --> 01:09:02,606
We're getting out of here!

546
01:09:02,817 --> 01:09:04,580
I'm not going anywhere.

547
01:09:08,389 --> 01:09:10,516
I like it here.

548
01:09:11,626 --> 01:09:13,924
- Annie?
- Let her go.

549
01:09:14,128 --> 01:09:17,564
- She belongs here now.
- Go back to the Addams family!

550
01:09:18,466 --> 01:09:21,367
Your friends are not
your friends anymore, Cass.

551
01:09:21,569 --> 01:09:25,403
You belong to Sean.
Go now, while there's still time.

552
01:09:39,721 --> 01:09:42,519
- Jeez! What are you doing?
- When you kissed me that night...

553
01:09:42,724 --> 01:09:45,488
it wasn't just good-bye.
You liked it.

554
01:09:46,027 --> 01:09:48,427
What are you talking about?
Let 's get out of here!

555
01:09:48,629 --> 01:09:50,961
How do you think I feel when
I gave up my first semester...

556
01:09:51,165 --> 01:09:53,759
to take care of you, and you
haven't even said thank you?

557
01:09:53,968 --> 01:09:56,027
What? Let 's just get out...

558
01:09:57,105 --> 01:09:59,596
- How did you hurt your hand?
- How do you think I feel...

559
01:09:59,807 --> 01:10:03,106
when I'm here for you, and
you're still hung up on a dead guy?

560
01:10:03,311 --> 01:10:04,972
Let me go!

561
01:10:06,114 --> 01:10:07,877
You kill me, Cassie.

562
01:10:08,082 --> 01:10:11,415
One last good-bye
forever kiss is all I want.

563
01:10:12,487 --> 01:10:13,886
Get off me now!

564
01:10:14,088 --> 01:10:17,080
When are you going to wake up?
Why do you think Annabel hates you?

565
01:10:17,291 --> 01:10:20,283
Sean is the only one who didn't
betray you, and you killed him!

566
01:10:25,399 --> 01:10:27,560
Sorry...

567
01:11:12,914 --> 01:11:14,381
God.

568
01:11:24,192 --> 01:11:26,387
Annabel?

569
01:11:33,601 --> 01:11:35,728
It 's her.

570
01:11:36,737 --> 01:11:38,796
Miss?

571
01:11:46,314 --> 01:11:48,680
I... I killed them.

572
01:11:51,352 --> 01:11:53,183
I killed them.

573
01:12:08,402 --> 01:12:10,996
Cassie, hold on.
Hold on.

574
01:12:12,206 --> 01:12:14,766
I killed them.

575
01:12:14,976 --> 01:12:16,466
No, you didn't.

576
01:12:16,878 --> 01:12:20,609
- Don't leave me.
- I won't leave your side.

577
01:12:24,952 --> 01:12:27,921
Stay with me, Cass.
I'm here. I'm right here.

578
01:12:28,122 --> 01:12:30,090
Stay with me.
Look at me.

579
01:12:30,291 --> 01:12:33,351
Look at me. I'm right here.
Stay with me, Cass, stay with me!

580
01:12:59,687 --> 01:13:01,985
Your tests indicate
you have a hemorrhage...

581
01:13:02,123 --> 01:13:04,250
as a result of your accident.

582
01:13:04,892 --> 01:13:07,554
Why wasn't my grade
posted with the others?

583
01:13:07,762 --> 01:13:11,027
There is no grade
for this kind of test.

584
01:14:26,440 --> 01:14:28,431
Mom!

585
01:14:33,114 --> 01:14:34,672
Mom!

586
01:14:48,129 --> 01:14:50,063
Miss?

587
01:14:58,839 --> 01:15:00,704
Try to take it easy!

588
01:15:12,153 --> 01:15:14,348
Don't be afraid.

589
01:15:20,061 --> 01:15:21,961
You have to fight.

590
01:16:00,367 --> 01:16:03,063
Eternal father, I offer you
the precious blood...

591
01:16:03,270 --> 01:16:06,706
of your divine son, Jesus.
Eternal rest grant onto them.

592
01:16:06,907 --> 01:16:09,239
And let perpetual life
wash over them.

593
01:16:09,510 --> 01:16:11,171
May they rest in peace.

594
01:16:15,483 --> 01:16:17,348
I'm dying.

595
01:16:18,719 --> 01:16:21,847
Fighting!
You're very strong, Cassie.

596
01:16:22,756 --> 01:16:24,656
But all this time...

597
01:16:24,859 --> 01:16:27,384
It 's been another kind of time.

598
01:16:27,595 --> 01:16:30,063
It 's like a dream that
your mind is creating...

599
01:16:30,264 --> 01:16:33,392
to keep you from waking up to
what you're not ready to accept.

600
01:16:33,634 --> 01:16:36,933
- You're fighting.
- They said that you were dead.

601
01:16:37,671 --> 01:16:41,402
I fought my own fight years ago.

602
01:16:41,876 --> 01:16:46,575
And I know that even a dream
of life is better than facing death.

603
01:16:47,214 --> 01:16:50,741
But what about Annabel,
and Matt, and the others?

604
01:16:51,685 --> 01:16:53,812
They're lost.

605
01:16:55,256 --> 01:16:58,020
- Sean?
- He survived.

606
01:17:06,700 --> 01:17:09,396
I loved him very much.

607
01:17:12,706 --> 01:17:15,470
- I don't want to die.
- Lf you were to die...

608
01:17:15,676 --> 01:17:18,236
so that he'd live,
would you feel absolved?

609
01:17:18,445 --> 01:17:20,276
I would.

610
01:17:22,349 --> 01:17:24,579
I would die for him.

611
01:17:25,219 --> 01:17:28,279
Do you love him enough
to live for him?

612
01:17:29,857 --> 01:17:31,916
I don't want to die!

613
01:17:44,371 --> 01:17:46,236
Sean...

614
01:17:48,042 --> 01:17:49,942
Sean!

615
01:17:52,513 --> 01:17:54,344
Sean?

616
01:18:01,989 --> 01:18:04,355
Sean, I'm sorry.

617
01:18:04,558 --> 01:18:07,857
It 's okay, it 's not your fault.

618
01:18:08,462 --> 01:18:10,692
I never told you.

619
01:18:11,498 --> 01:18:15,025
- What? Tell me now.
- I...

620
01:18:16,570 --> 01:18:18,265
Love...

621
01:18:18,739 --> 01:18:20,639
I love you.

622
01:18:20,841 --> 01:18:22,638
I love you too, baby.

623
01:18:37,825 --> 01:18:40,658
You made it, honey.
You made it!

624
01:18:41,228 --> 01:18:44,527
We told you to hang on,
and you did!

625
01:18:44,732 --> 01:18:46,859
We told you not to leave us!

626
01:18:49,203 --> 01:18:51,034
How long have I been here?

627
01:18:51,238 --> 01:18:53,229
It 's been two days.

628
01:18:59,813 --> 01:19:02,373
Sean kept talking to you
all the time saying...

629
01:19:02,583 --> 01:19:04,346
"Don't give up.

630
01:19:04,885 --> 01:19:06,785
Keep fighting."

631
01:19:07,021 --> 01:19:10,149
I know. I heard him.

632
01:19:14,128 --> 01:19:16,255
I heard all of you.

633
01:19:32,813 --> 01:19:34,940
I heard all of you.
