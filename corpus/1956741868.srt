1
00:01:16,037 --> 00:01:17,829
They got water, William,
but it ain't much.

2
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:19,239
Where do you get your water?

3
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,240
From traders.

4
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:23,109
From a village named Chinle.

5
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:24,260
Where is this Chinle?

6
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:26,459
Due east.

7
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,539
If that's true, Chinle
would make a good base camp.

8
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:31,189
Tomas, you take some
men, secure the village.

9
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:33,029
We're gonna forage this
area for more supplies.

10
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:34,289
We'll see you there in a week.

11
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:35,619
Yes, sir.

12
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:37,993
Please, sir, leave us some water?

13
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,140
You won't be needing it.

14
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:45,490
Do it.

15
00:03:06,466 --> 00:03:07,633
Where is he?

16
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:09,770
Where's William?

17
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:56,429
Why don't you set a date, Val?

18
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:58,309
My father's angry.

19
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:00,659
To him, your delay is an insult.

20
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:03,079
Luis, don't you want
to see something of the world,

21
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,019
other than this valley?

22
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,909
It's just desert.

23
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:08,129
Goes on and on.

24
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:10,069
Time before, there was so much more.

25
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:11,869
Time before.

26
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:14,143
You're crazy grandfather and his tales.

27
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:17,319
If it was so wonderful,

28
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,079
then why'd they have to
tear holes in the sky

29
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,485
and destroy all the cities?

30
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:21,909
Yeah, but the merchants
that we trade with,

31
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:23,089
they speak of other places,

32
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:25,189
places bigger than Chinle.
Traders just want to sound

33
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:27,449
more important than they really are.

34
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:29,223
Val, it's not what I want.

35
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:31,490
I know.

36
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:36,089
And I want to marry you, it's just that...

37
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:37,483
Just that what?

38
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,619
It's been over a year
since I spoke for you.

39
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:43,139
Talk to you father.

40
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:44,140
He knows how I feel.

41
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:46,540
I will.

42
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:48,490
I promise.

43
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,883
Val, we have to face
our responsibilities.

44
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:57,937
Come on, we better get back
before we both get burned.

45
00:06:40,326 --> 00:06:41,159
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

46
00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:41,992
Look at them run!

47
00:06:41,993 --> 00:06:43,095
Look at them go!

48
00:06:43,096 --> 00:06:44,945
There they go!

49
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:46,608
Let's go, guys!

50
00:06:46,609 --> 00:06:47,609
Yahoo!

51
00:06:54,836 --> 00:06:56,572
- All right!
- Secure the perimeter!

52
00:06:56,573 --> 00:06:57,421
- Move over!
- Go!

53
00:06:57,422 --> 00:06:58,807
- Move over!
- Let's go!

54
00:06:58,808 --> 00:06:59,761
Move over!

55
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,583
Who's the leader here?

56
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:10,529
I'm Reynaldo, Chief of Chinle.

57
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:11,719
What is it you want of us?

58
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,640
We have heard that you have

59
00:07:12,641 --> 00:07:14,319
an abundance supply of water here.

60
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,609
Is that true?

61
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:17,189
Why, yes, it comes from the spring

62
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:19,369
upon which our village was founded.

63
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:21,149
It's our most precious commodity.

64
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:23,350
You're more than welcome
to help yourselves.

65
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:33,299
Well, Reynaldo, you and your people

66
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:36,229
should feel fortunate and honored,

67
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:39,629
for as of now, your village
is under consideration

68
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:43,229
as the future headquarters
of William's command!

69
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:45,299
And since it's quite obvious

70
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,723
that this village is quite defenseless,

71
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:50,719
we will remain here to provide protection

72
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:55,430
for you and your precious
commodity until William arrives.

73
00:07:57,238 --> 00:07:59,317
- Come here.
- Oh!

74
00:08:06,055 --> 00:08:07,239
No!

75
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:10,479
No!

76
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:15,780
Samuel?

77
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,520
Samuel.

78
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:27,219
Let that be a warning to any one of you

79
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:30,833
who dares resist the force
of William's command!

80
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:50,460
My condolences, sir.

81
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:51,460
Thank you.

82
00:08:53,437 --> 00:08:54,437
Sorry.

83
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:02,029
What Samuel did was very brave.

84
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:03,989
He was a good soldier...
Protected me from that scum

85
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:05,253
cost my brother's life.

86
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:09,018
We have to get rid of them!

87
00:09:09,019 --> 00:09:10,339
Val, what can we do?

88
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:12,309
You saw what they...
Need to fight!

89
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:14,209
We outnumber them at least 10-to-one.

90
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:15,369
They are warriors.

91
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:16,759
We are not.

92
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,549
I'm sure they wouldn't
hesitate to kill us all,

93
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:21,459
just like Samuel, if we
try to go up against them.

94
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:23,259
Val, my father's right.

95
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:25,369
Our situation here is hopeless.

96
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:26,720
You're the hopeless case.

97
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:35,293
Look, you really shouldn't
be so hard on Luis.

98
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:37,543
He means well.

99
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:41,269
Father, we've got to get some help.

100
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:42,959
From who?

101
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,189
- Where?
- I don't know,

102
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:45,587
but we've got to!

103
00:10:52,739 --> 00:10:55,156
Hey, go on, have some more.

104
00:12:51,378 --> 00:12:52,777
Get back!

105
00:12:52,778 --> 00:12:54,328
- Get back!
- Come on, come on!

106
00:12:54,329 --> 00:12:55,502
Come on, get back!

107
00:12:55,503 --> 00:12:57,086
Get back, get away!

108
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:05,919
Where's your weapon, girl?

109
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,159
I haven't got one.

110
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,160
Oh.

111
00:13:08,902 --> 00:13:11,613
Shouldn't be out here in the
wilderness without a weapon.

112
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:15,138
Who are you?

113
00:13:15,139 --> 00:13:16,139
Just a traveler.

114
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:20,170
My name's Michael.

115
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:23,510
Val.

116
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:28,789
Well, Val, where you come from?

117
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:29,623
Where you going?

118
00:13:29,624 --> 00:13:30,633
I'm from Chinle.

119
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,989
I'm looking for help.

120
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:36,090
My village is being taken over by warriors

121
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:38,323
from William's army.

122
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,829
I want to find warriors that
will come back and liberate us

123
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:43,808
and defend us against William.

124
00:13:43,809 --> 00:13:46,169
When is William coming?

125
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:48,975
Well, the soldiers
say in about one week's time.

126
00:13:48,976 --> 00:13:49,976
Uh-huh.

127
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:56,253
Well, a lot of the
warriors go to Freetown.

128
00:13:57,510 --> 00:13:58,760
Been looking for service.

129
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:02,263
If I wanted to hire somebody,
that's where I'd go.

130
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:05,150
Where is this place?

131
00:14:05,151 --> 00:14:07,647
Just happens
that's where I'm headed.

132
00:14:07,648 --> 00:14:08,909
Come on.

133
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:10,515
Good.

134
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:13,203
Then you can help me find some warriors.

135
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,569
Look, there's
nothing we can do.

136
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:25,429
All we have to do is just stay calm

137
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:27,190
and try not to antagonize them.

138
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:31,079
I've looked everywhere.

139
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,349
Where could she have gone?

140
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:34,039
I don't know anymore.

141
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,670
We can only hope for the best.

142
00:15:48,237 --> 00:15:52,047
John, John, John, John, John,

143
00:15:52,048 --> 00:15:54,965
John, John, John, John, John, John!

144
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:59,838
Are there any more challengers?!

145
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:04,839
John, John, John,
John, John, John, John, John!

146
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,255
Does anyone dare challenge John?!

147
00:16:07,256 --> 00:16:10,506
John, John, John, John, John!

148
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:13,971
Challenger?

149
00:16:42,257 --> 00:16:45,080
Better keep your mind on the joust, kid.

150
00:16:45,081 --> 00:16:47,414
Don't want to blow the scam.

151
00:16:57,729 --> 00:17:01,479
John, John,
John, John, John, John!

152
00:17:05,089 --> 00:17:06,839
Take him out!

153
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:56,867
He's really good, isn't he?

154
00:18:01,415 --> 00:18:04,832
Very first time I ever seen that.

155
00:18:07,014 --> 00:18:08,681
Pay up time, guys!

156
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:12,890
Thank you.

157
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:17,173
Hey!

158
00:18:17,174 --> 00:18:18,819
John Loa.

159
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:19,820
Ricardo.

160
00:18:20,562 --> 00:18:23,139
Aren't you a sight for sore eyes?

161
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:24,889
The hell are you doing here?

162
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:25,890
I bet on you.

163
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:28,799
Yeah, well, I'm sorry about that.

164
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:29,800
Good match.

165
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,289
Listen, kid, if you're
any kind of a man,

166
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:34,349
you'll give me a shot at winning

167
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:36,399
some of that back at the dice table.

168
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,400
If you can.

169
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:42,093
Ricardo, I need a
drink, and he's buying.

170
00:19:00,462 --> 00:19:02,962
Well, easy come, easy go, kid.

171
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:09,490
Should I go talk to them?

172
00:19:12,298 --> 00:19:16,131
Well, that is what you
came here for, right?

173
00:19:24,533 --> 00:19:26,389
Ricardo, there's a tournament
in Perrysburg next week.

174
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:27,295
You should go.

175
00:19:27,296 --> 00:19:28,999
- Yeah, yeah.
- Excuse me.

176
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:29,833
Hello.

177
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:30,833
Hi.

178
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:34,343
I'd like to talk to you about a job.

179
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:41,910
Hey, don't I know you guys?

180
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:44,540
I don't think so, pal.

181
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:49,987
You pulled that scam up in Brimfield.

182
00:19:51,263 --> 00:19:52,849
Look, pal, I've never been to Brimfield.

183
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:53,869
Beat it, will ya?

184
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:56,959
You hoodwinked the
whole town, including me.

185
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,985
Scammers, huh?!

186
00:20:22,796 --> 00:20:24,302
Get out of here!

187
00:21:20,847 --> 00:21:22,469
The soldiers say that William

188
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:27,383
will defend us against harm,
but I don't believe them.

189
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,650
They killed my brother.

190
00:21:32,050 --> 00:21:33,349
Please?

191
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:36,729
What kind of a favor do you owe them?

192
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:39,849
Well, we don't really
have any money to speak of,

193
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:41,869
but we can feed you and shelter you.

194
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:43,919
Look, you seem like a nice girl,

195
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,449
and I'm sorry about your village,

196
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:48,019
but we're just passing through.

197
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:50,379
In fact, me and the kid
here are gonna clean up

198
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:52,030
on that tournament in Perrysburg.

199
00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:56,999
Yeah, but on our way
back, we could stop...

200
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,100
That'll be too late.

201
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,477
William will already have taken the town.

202
00:22:02,451 --> 00:22:03,839
You really think that three warriors

203
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,579
can stop William and his army?

204
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:06,580
Four.

205
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:10,983
There's four of us.

206
00:22:10,984 --> 00:22:12,086
What?

207
00:22:12,087 --> 00:22:13,369
Old man?

208
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:15,209
He helped out at the saloon.

209
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:16,613
It's not the same thing.

210
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:18,690
Wait!

211
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:20,960
We have water.

212
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:25,500
How much water?

213
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:27,413
An endless supply.

214
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:32,793
And if you help us, you can
have as much of it as you want.

215
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:37,490
Well, it's like I was saying,

216
00:22:37,491 --> 00:22:40,199
we can always go to Perrysburg.

217
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,263
These fine people need our help.

218
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:44,770
Thank you.

219
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:27,519
Michael.

220
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,169
How you doing, Miranda?

221
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:30,130
Surviving.

222
00:23:30,131 --> 00:23:32,399
Those bastards tried to attack me.

223
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,899
What's going on?

224
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,613
This is Val.

225
00:23:35,614 --> 00:23:36,709
She's from Chinle.

226
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:39,699
We're at her service in
defensive of her village.

227
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:40,949
From who?

228
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:42,499
William.

229
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,829
I guess that
gives you a good reason,

230
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:46,159
but what about them?

231
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,329
What are you talking about?

232
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:48,919
He didn't tell you?

233
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,309
It's ancient history.

234
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:51,960
It's got nothing to do with this.

235
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:57,383
Are you still looking for more fighters?

236
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:01,650
Yes.

237
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:07,289
Any village girl who
has the guts to go off

238
00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:10,863
and find men like this are
somebody I can work for.

239
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:18,553
Here, take this just in case.

240
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:33,009
I've been spending a lot
of time convincing the people

241
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:35,979
that having William's headquarters
here is good for Chinle.

242
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:38,273
I hope you'll put in a good
word for me when he arrives.

243
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:42,120
Why don't you take
care of man Keith here?

244
00:24:45,870 --> 00:24:46,870
Excuse me.

245
00:24:55,663 --> 00:24:56,940
Have some more, come on.

246
00:24:56,941 --> 00:24:57,941
Here.

247
00:25:37,622 --> 00:25:38,622
Hey!

248
00:25:51,732 --> 00:25:52,851
What was that?

249
00:25:52,852 --> 00:25:53,852
Come on.

250
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:29,817
Go on, get out of here!

251
00:27:11,683 --> 00:27:14,706
I don't know who you are,
but when William gets here,

252
00:27:14,707 --> 00:27:17,029
you're gonna be fucking dog food.

253
00:27:19,222 --> 00:27:20,573
I can hardly wait.

254
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,589
You've gravely compromised
our situation here

255
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:31,559
by returning with these ruffians, Val.

256
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:34,099
I have brought warriors that
will fight to keep us free.

257
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:35,659
Warriors? Huh.

258
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:37,529
A surprise attack on a few soldiers

259
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:39,330
on an unguarded moment is one thing.

260
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:42,339
Do you expect them to be
more than a moments delay

261
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:44,429
to William when he arrives with his army?

262
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:47,289
I thought you spoke for your
people when you came for us.

263
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:49,829
There is still those who believe.

264
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:52,249
Luis, will
you tell your bride-to-be

265
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:53,932
she's making a big mistake here?

266
00:27:53,933 --> 00:27:56,169
I am not making a mistake!

267
00:27:56,170 --> 00:27:59,119
Chinle has been free since
the time of our grandfathers!

268
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,839
And I'm sure that there's still some of us

269
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,286
who want to keep it that way!

270
00:28:02,287 --> 00:28:03,120
Yeah.

271
00:28:03,121 --> 00:28:05,089
Listen to me, listen to me!

272
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:08,309
When William comes, he will
kill these so-called warriors.

273
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:10,199
He will punish us for harboring them.

274
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,119
Is that what you want?

275
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,820
Then I say we get rid of them now!

276
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:17,456
Luis, aren't you going to help me?

277
00:28:17,457 --> 00:28:18,869
I want to, Val, but...

278
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:20,389
If we surrender to William,

279
00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:21,940
will you be able to defend me?!

280
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:26,519
Do you want to be forced
to do their bidding?!

281
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,999
Will you still be able to love your wives

282
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,950
after they've been raped by these men?!

283
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:32,719
I say that it's better that we die free

284
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,933
than exist as slaves!

285
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:39,589
Chinle has never been the subject

286
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:41,403
of one man's rule before.

287
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:47,773
If we give into William, our
council will be destroyed,

288
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:52,853
and we will have no voice
in what happens to us.

289
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:55,159
We must fight!

290
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,220
Fight, we must fight!

291
00:28:57,221 --> 00:28:59,969
- Fight, fight!
- Fight, fight, fight!

292
00:28:59,970 --> 00:29:02,209
Fight, fight, fight, yes, fight.

293
00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:03,939
How can we fight?

294
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:06,109
You're farmers here, not fighters.

295
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:07,660
What do we know about fighting?

296
00:29:09,627 --> 00:29:14,083
If you are willing to learn,
we are willing to teach you.

297
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:16,559
This is not a rich community.

298
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:19,119
We could never afford such services.

299
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,959
Well, you all look
like honorable men to me.

300
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,649
And once you see the
value of our services,

301
00:29:23,650 --> 00:29:25,429
I'm sure you'll make us a fair offer.

302
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:26,479
How say you, then?!

303
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,480
Yes!

304
00:29:29,141 --> 00:29:30,108
Fight, fight!

305
00:29:30,109 --> 00:29:32,579
- Fight!
- Fight, I say fight!

306
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:34,183
The people have spoken.

307
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:36,490
For now.

308
00:29:38,753 --> 00:29:39,953
That was an easy sell.

309
00:29:47,283 --> 00:29:48,942
This is great.

310
00:29:48,943 --> 00:29:51,289
Been a long time I've been soaked.

311
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:53,363
I was starting to feel crusty.

312
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:58,689
Ah, that's nice.

313
00:29:58,690 --> 00:30:01,209
You know, my kid sister
used to do that for me.

314
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:02,210
Where is she now?

315
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:04,890
Gone.

316
00:30:06,361 --> 00:30:07,361
I'm sorry.

317
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:11,390
Miranda?

318
00:30:13,947 --> 00:30:15,463
How did you become a warrior?

319
00:30:16,930 --> 00:30:19,653
I was out hunting for
berries when the raiders came.

320
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,363
I hid in the bushes.

321
00:30:24,161 --> 00:30:26,163
It seemed like it went on forever.

322
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:29,780
Afterwards, they burned everything.

323
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,600
The smell.

324
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:38,083
I couldn't even identify my
father and mother or my sister.

325
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,469
Some traders found me a few days later.

326
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:46,933
They took me with them to
look after their needs.

327
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:51,619
It took me almost a year to
get a chance to kill them.

328
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:54,229
After that, word got around,

329
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:56,080
and people mostly just left me alone.

330
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:01,839
I teamed up with another
warrior, an older guy.

331
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:02,840
He taught me a lot.

332
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:06,373
He died fighting William.

333
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:09,893
I still carry his gun.

334
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:18,399
Sounds so hard.

335
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,267
It was.

336
00:31:19,267 --> 00:31:20,267
And Michael?

337
00:31:21,670 --> 00:31:23,620
I met him a few times over the years.

338
00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:26,330
I know him mostly by reputation.

339
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:28,919
He's a loner like me.

340
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:32,023
Sometimes, I wish I
could leave this place.

341
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,009
So go, but you have to let me teach you

342
00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:38,339
what you need to know
to survive out there.

343
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:39,580
Can't leave here.

344
00:31:41,991 --> 00:31:43,313
I have responsibilities.

345
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:46,419
Then we just have to
make sure to make Chinle

346
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:47,659
the kind of place you'd like to live

347
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:48,960
for the rest of your life.

348
00:31:56,297 --> 00:31:57,726
Hey!

349
00:31:57,727 --> 00:31:58,560
Hey!

350
00:31:58,561 --> 00:31:59,916
Hey!

351
00:31:59,917 --> 00:32:00,750
Hey!

352
00:32:00,751 --> 00:32:01,988
Hey!

353
00:32:01,989 --> 00:32:02,822
Hey!

354
00:32:02,823 --> 00:32:04,807
- Hey!
- Go for it.

355
00:32:04,808 --> 00:32:05,706
Go, Daniel, come on!

356
00:32:05,707 --> 00:32:08,162
- Yes, come on!
- Come on!

357
00:32:15,932 --> 00:32:17,783
Yeah!

358
00:32:17,784 --> 00:32:19,004
Way to go, Daniel!

359
00:32:20,069 --> 00:32:21,889
Children, come here!

360
00:32:21,890 --> 00:32:22,973
Come on! Come on!

361
00:32:25,249 --> 00:32:26,360
Way to go, kid!

362
00:32:37,281 --> 00:32:38,379
How's the work going?

363
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:39,380
Okay.

364
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:48,359
So that's the guy you're gonna marry?

365
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:49,360
Yes.

366
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,759
Why?

367
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:52,889
Well, he didn't give you much support

368
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:53,993
at that town meeting.

369
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:58,169
Well, sometimes, Luis
can be a bit indecisive.

370
00:32:58,170 --> 00:32:59,270
Doesn't mean anything.

371
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:01,270
Does he love you?

372
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:03,239
Yes.

373
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,329
Of course.

374
00:33:04,330 --> 00:33:05,613
What about you?

375
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:10,469
Look, our marriage is
gonna end the bad blood

376
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:12,303
between his family and my family.

377
00:33:14,010 --> 00:33:15,083
You don't understand.

378
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,790
You're right, I don't understand.

379
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:24,430
If you were my girl,

380
00:33:24,431 --> 00:33:27,200
I'd stand up and fight
for you no matter what.

381
00:33:58,221 --> 00:33:59,388
Good, fellas!

382
00:33:59,389 --> 00:34:00,389
Yes!

383
00:34:10,022 --> 00:34:11,249
Good.

384
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:12,250
Good. That's better.

385
00:34:13,942 --> 00:34:16,623
If you learn to use these
tools to defend yourselves,

386
00:34:17,841 --> 00:34:20,379
a much better chance staying alive.

387
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:21,930
Let's try it again. Who's next?

388
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:27,390
How about me?

389
00:34:31,097 --> 00:34:33,247
You don't have to do this.

390
00:34:33,248 --> 00:34:34,110
It's all right.

391
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:35,110
Go ahead.

392
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:37,920
You sure?

393
00:34:39,843 --> 00:34:40,843
All right.

394
00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:42,589
- Ooh!
- Ooh.

395
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:44,787
All right!

396
00:34:44,787 --> 00:34:45,620
Oh!

397
00:34:47,118 --> 00:34:48,000
- Not bad.
- See?

398
00:34:48,001 --> 00:34:49,895
Don't even really need the stick.

399
00:35:13,370 --> 00:35:14,370
Luis, right?

400
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:16,550
Come up here.

401
00:35:19,730 --> 00:35:21,328
Pull that sword on Dorian.

402
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:25,803
Come on, Luis, let's
see what you're made of.

403
00:35:27,296 --> 00:35:29,379
Come in and lunge at him.

404
00:35:30,306 --> 00:35:31,865
Oh, hey!

405
00:35:31,866 --> 00:35:33,286
Come on!

406
00:35:33,287 --> 00:35:34,190
Hey!

407
00:35:34,191 --> 00:35:36,258
Come on!

408
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:37,409
Come on!

409
00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:38,243
Get in there!

410
00:35:38,244 --> 00:35:39,542
- Go Luis!
- Hey!

411
00:35:39,543 --> 00:35:43,973
Go, Luis!

412
00:35:43,974 --> 00:35:46,643
- Oh, get up!
- Get up, get up, get up!

413
00:36:01,876 --> 00:36:03,889
He's got the
sword, he's got the sword!

414
00:36:03,890 --> 00:36:05,165
- Come on, Luis.
- Go Luis!

415
00:36:21,527 --> 00:36:23,583
You're not worth it, not now.

416
00:36:31,976 --> 00:36:33,589
I think you blew it, kid.

417
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:35,249
No need to kill the chief's son.

418
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:36,739
No, I was just showing him how to fight!

419
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:37,740
No, you weren't.

420
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:40,413
You're gonna apologize to him too.

421
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:49,149
Luis, what's wrong?

422
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:50,150
What do you care?

423
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,289
Look, you think I don't
know what's going on

424
00:36:52,290 --> 00:36:53,689
between you and that Dorian?

425
00:36:53,690 --> 00:36:55,629
There's nothing going on!

426
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:57,549
I'm not blind, Val.

427
00:36:57,550 --> 00:36:58,869
At least be honest enough to admit

428
00:36:58,870 --> 00:37:01,289
that you have doubts about us.

429
00:37:01,290 --> 00:37:03,769
I know what my responsibilities are,

430
00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:04,969
and I'm gonna marry you!

431
00:37:04,970 --> 00:37:05,870
Words.

432
00:37:05,871 --> 00:37:06,909
I'm beginning to regret the day

433
00:37:06,910 --> 00:37:08,610
that I ever fell in love with you.

434
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:14,369
You're right.

435
00:37:14,370 --> 00:37:16,949
Those damn warriors are
nothing but trouble.

436
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:18,869
They'll ruin us if they stay.

437
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:21,493
Well, what made you come to your senses?

438
00:37:22,830 --> 00:37:23,859
That damn Dorian,

439
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:26,263
made a fool of me in
front of all the people.

440
00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:29,220
I say to hell with the stupid training!

441
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:31,949
You know, I've been thinking about this

442
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:33,559
ever since they got here.

443
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:35,309
There's only one thing we can do.

444
00:37:35,310 --> 00:37:36,310
What?

445
00:37:36,311 --> 00:37:37,790
Get a message to William.

446
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:41,195
No, no, no.

447
00:37:41,195 --> 00:37:42,195
Just feel.

448
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:49,817
Yeah, let's take a break
for about whatever.

449
00:37:58,105 --> 00:38:01,069
They certainly are hard workers.

450
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:02,520
Yeah, they're good farmers.

451
00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:04,949
Terrible fighters.

452
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:07,186
Oh, I'm not worried about the villagers.

453
00:38:07,187 --> 00:38:09,453
But you, John, I don't know.

454
00:38:10,693 --> 00:38:11,743
You don't trust me?

455
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:15,779
Well, you're an excellent fighter,

456
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:18,257
but these villages need
something more, though.

457
00:38:18,258 --> 00:38:21,009
You're not concerned about these people.

458
00:38:21,010 --> 00:38:22,359
Don't give a damn about this village.

459
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:26,099
You're just using them as
an excuse for your revenge.

460
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:27,559
Redemption.

461
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:30,525
I'm interested in justice, not revenge.

462
00:38:30,526 --> 00:38:34,104
Yeah, well, whatever you call it.

463
00:38:34,105 --> 00:38:36,193
Well, what are you interested in, John?

464
00:38:37,290 --> 00:38:38,290
Water?

465
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,520
The girl?

466
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:04,184
I heard Dorian messed up.

467
00:39:05,964 --> 00:39:06,797
It was no big deal.

468
00:39:06,798 --> 00:39:09,119
He was just having a little fun with Luis.

469
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:11,370
Well, I hope his fun
doesn't get us killed.

470
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:14,339
I wouldn't worry about it.

471
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:16,803
When the fighting starts,
Dorian will be just fine.

472
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:20,120
It's because of Val, isn't it?

473
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:24,323
It's pretty obvious he likes
her, if that's what you mean.

474
00:39:25,810 --> 00:39:27,529
What about you?

475
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:28,494
Why are you here?

476
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:31,540
For the water.

477
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:33,973
No, I mean, really.

478
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:36,859
I grew up fighting.

479
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:39,060
It's the only thing I
really know how to do.

480
00:39:41,330 --> 00:39:44,089
Wouldn't you like to put
down your weapon some day

481
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:46,239
and live a quieter life?

482
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:48,449
There is no quieter life in this world.

483
00:39:48,450 --> 00:39:51,783
You either fight or you
get killed by those who do.

484
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:55,610
Well, maybe some day we'll
find a better place, John.

485
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:58,800
Some day.

486
00:40:11,350 --> 00:40:12,959
Luis.

487
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,679
Hey, listen, I'm sorry
about what happened.

488
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,989
Sometimes, I get a
little bit carried away.

489
00:40:17,990 --> 00:40:19,163
I meant you no insult.

490
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:23,023
Just keep the hell away from Val.

491
00:40:32,859 --> 00:40:33,859
Wake up!

492
00:40:37,790 --> 00:40:39,040
Stupid farmers!

493
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,859
We should've left when they
said they didn't want us.

494
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:45,493
Hell, nobody wants us.

495
00:40:46,398 --> 00:40:47,813
That never stopped us before.

496
00:40:48,699 --> 00:40:51,249
We should be in Perrysburg
doing what we do best.

497
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:54,070
Do I detect a little jealousy, kid?

498
00:40:55,133 --> 00:40:57,363
'Cause Val and the chief's
son are getting married.

499
00:41:00,610 --> 00:41:02,099
What about him?

500
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:03,689
What gives him the right to speak for us?

501
00:41:03,690 --> 00:41:04,859
Who the hell does he think he is?

502
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:06,423
Ah, forget about him.

503
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,649
This ain't boy scout troop.

504
00:41:08,650 --> 00:41:11,139
I don't care, I don't trust
him, and neither should you.

505
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:13,289
I didn't say I trusted him.

506
00:41:13,290 --> 00:41:15,213
We wouldn't want to
blow a good thing here.

507
00:41:16,685 --> 00:41:18,534
What do you mean?

508
00:41:18,535 --> 00:41:20,385
Well, you want the girl, don't you?

509
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:22,825
Don't you?

510
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:26,729
Well, look, how many men
can this William have?

511
00:41:26,730 --> 00:41:27,913
30 or 40, right?

512
00:41:28,826 --> 00:41:31,423
So you whack him, and
you look like a hero.

513
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:35,050
Where does he fit in?

514
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,923
Haven't quite figured
out the professor yet.

515
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:44,229
Miranda said he used to be a
farmer with a wife and kids.

516
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:46,080
He don't look like no farmer to me.

517
00:41:47,298 --> 00:41:49,748
Yeah, 10 years of fighting
will do that to you.

518
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:54,349
William and his raiders
killed Michael's family,

519
00:41:54,350 --> 00:41:55,499
burned his farm.

520
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:57,233
He's been chasing him ever since.

521
00:42:19,650 --> 00:42:22,126
Tell William they're many of us here

522
00:42:22,127 --> 00:42:24,100
who want to be rid of those outlaws.

523
00:42:25,368 --> 00:42:28,906
Here.

524
00:42:28,907 --> 00:42:29,907
Thanks.

525
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:45,453
The prisoners are gone.

526
00:42:45,454 --> 00:42:46,799
- What?
- Someone must've let them out

527
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:47,633
during the night.

528
00:42:47,634 --> 00:42:48,859
Where's Luis? I'm gonna find him.

529
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:50,239
Hold it. Hold it.

530
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:51,716
Accusing Luis whether he's guilty or not

531
00:42:51,717 --> 00:42:53,293
is not gonna solve anything.

532
00:42:54,270 --> 00:42:55,117
Issue now is time.

533
00:42:55,118 --> 00:42:57,702
Got to get these defenses finished.

534
00:42:57,703 --> 00:42:58,953
Get the others.

535
00:43:09,379 --> 00:43:12,046
All right, grab that corner, up.

536
00:43:26,931 --> 00:43:29,598
More sandbags over here.

537
00:43:37,527 --> 00:43:39,027
Want some water?

538
00:43:44,961 --> 00:43:47,378
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

539
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:24,940
Come on!

540
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:46,153
What happened?

541
00:44:48,242 --> 00:44:52,519
The villagers of Chinle
have recruited mercenaries.

542
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:55,489
They snuck in, took us by surprise.

543
00:44:55,490 --> 00:44:56,703
How many mercenaries?

544
00:44:58,040 --> 00:44:58,873
Five.

545
00:44:58,874 --> 00:45:00,629
Ha, only five?

546
00:45:00,630 --> 00:45:03,129
They're good at what they do.

547
00:45:03,130 --> 00:45:06,853
They took me and Jim prisoner,
but we managed to escape.

548
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:10,199
It wasn't easy.

549
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:11,950
We had to get back to let you know.

550
00:45:13,042 --> 00:45:14,392
Is there any water there?

551
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:16,920
Lots.

552
00:45:17,890 --> 00:45:18,969
We're low on gasoline.

553
00:45:18,970 --> 00:45:21,793
We have to wait for the
convoy to get replenished.

554
00:45:23,750 --> 00:45:25,749
You take some men and a
few vehicles to Chinle,

555
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:28,759
and when I get there, I
want to see five bodies

556
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:30,779
hanging from your gallows.

557
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:31,923
As good as done.

558
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:47,949
This gonna work?

559
00:45:47,950 --> 00:45:49,633
Well, let's hope so.

560
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:52,423
We won't know until it happens.

561
00:45:54,140 --> 00:45:56,890
Think we can depend on them
when the fighting starts?

562
00:45:59,310 --> 00:46:02,483
Well, I remember my first battle,

563
00:46:03,427 --> 00:46:05,853
I didn't know who to
trust, who to believe in,

564
00:46:06,850 --> 00:46:09,298
so I just worried about myself.

565
00:46:09,299 --> 00:46:10,466
Came out okay.

566
00:46:11,425 --> 00:46:12,425
We won.

567
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:15,500
Fighting when you know
what you're up against,

568
00:46:16,770 --> 00:46:18,223
hell, I can handle that.

569
00:46:20,230 --> 00:46:22,249
Something like this,

570
00:46:22,250 --> 00:46:26,363
well, truth is, I've never
been in a real battle before.

571
00:46:27,850 --> 00:46:29,500
Never thought about being scared.

572
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:32,210
I just hope I'm up to it.

573
00:46:37,290 --> 00:46:39,039
Every warrior I've ever known,

574
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:41,213
who was worth a damn, felt like that.

575
00:46:42,053 --> 00:46:43,303
Take your time.

576
00:46:45,452 --> 00:46:46,702
You'll be fine.

577
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:13,920
Nothing.

578
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:17,875
Maybe they're not coming.

579
00:47:17,876 --> 00:47:19,499
I wouldn't count on that,

580
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:21,700
especially if Tomas
told William we're here.

581
00:47:24,330 --> 00:47:28,173
Dorian thinks that Luis let Tomas out.

582
00:47:34,870 --> 00:47:35,870
What do you think?

583
00:47:39,236 --> 00:47:40,486
I don't know.

584
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:46,452
I'm so confused.

585
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:48,600
So is Luis.

586
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:51,323
He thinks you're leaving him for Dorian.

587
00:47:52,167 --> 00:47:53,167
Are you?

588
00:48:10,898 --> 00:48:13,147
Miranda, someone's coming.

589
00:48:16,847 --> 00:48:17,830
I count five.

590
00:48:17,831 --> 00:48:19,697
Get back and warn the others.

591
00:48:24,858 --> 00:48:26,136
They're coming!

592
00:48:26,137 --> 00:48:27,206
Open the gate!

593
00:48:27,207 --> 00:48:28,414
They're coming!

594
00:48:28,415 --> 00:48:30,248
Open the gate!

595
00:48:31,292 --> 00:48:32,875
Let's go, let's go!

596
00:48:35,110 --> 00:48:37,229
There's five
cars heading this way.

597
00:48:37,230 --> 00:48:39,133
Five cars isn't William's army.

598
00:48:40,101 --> 00:48:41,609
They don't know what we've done here.

599
00:48:41,610 --> 00:48:42,610
We outnumber them.

600
00:48:43,510 --> 00:48:44,510
Let's get ready!

601
00:49:22,535 --> 00:49:25,899
I understand that some of
you aren't happy with William,

602
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:28,289
and you think you need
some other protection.

603
00:49:28,290 --> 00:49:30,273
Which of you mercenaries is the leader?

604
00:49:33,820 --> 00:49:34,820
You?

605
00:49:35,690 --> 00:49:36,690
That's right.

606
00:49:36,691 --> 00:49:38,339
I know this man.

607
00:49:38,340 --> 00:49:41,379
He seeks vengeance for something
that happened long ago.

608
00:49:41,380 --> 00:49:44,653
He's not doing this for
you, but you will pay.

609
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:49,509
But if you surrender now,
your lives will be spared.

610
00:49:49,510 --> 00:49:51,259
It's your choice!

611
00:49:51,260 --> 00:49:52,823
You have 30 seconds to decide!

612
00:50:07,434 --> 00:50:08,434
15!

613
00:50:11,390 --> 00:50:14,269
No one gives a damn what you say, Jason!

614
00:50:14,270 --> 00:50:15,923
The next shot won't be a warning!

615
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:20,913
Okay, you asked for it!

616
00:52:58,773 --> 00:52:59,690
Wait!

617
00:52:59,691 --> 00:53:00,927
Don't kill him!

618
00:53:03,085 --> 00:53:04,773
That's William's right hand man.

619
00:53:05,940 --> 00:53:07,140
We may have use for him.

620
00:53:08,510 --> 00:53:10,016
Jason.

621
00:53:17,630 --> 00:53:18,730
Thank you for today.

622
00:53:19,990 --> 00:53:21,519
Everybody did their part.

623
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:23,329
Not everybody.

624
00:53:23,330 --> 00:53:26,909
When the fighting started,
Luis was nowhere to be found.

625
00:53:26,910 --> 00:53:28,260
That doesn't surprise me.

626
00:53:29,298 --> 00:53:32,068
I'm not so confused anymore.

627
00:53:32,069 --> 00:53:34,259
What do you mean?

628
00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:37,263
Well, could never marry a
man that I didn't respect.

629
00:53:59,670 --> 00:54:00,670
Hi.

630
00:54:07,838 --> 00:54:11,629
You know, I really thought some of them

631
00:54:11,630 --> 00:54:12,830
would go with him today.

632
00:54:15,450 --> 00:54:18,219
I guess I didn't know all my friends

633
00:54:18,220 --> 00:54:20,420
well enough to know
what choice they'd make.

634
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:23,739
Well, most of them probably didn't know

635
00:54:23,740 --> 00:54:26,390
what choice they'd make
themselves till they made it.

636
00:54:29,260 --> 00:54:30,360
These are good people.

637
00:54:32,390 --> 00:54:33,390
Yeah.

638
00:54:36,209 --> 00:54:38,059
We really taught them a lesson today.

639
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:43,603
Val, what happened today was good,

640
00:54:44,930 --> 00:54:46,819
but it's a cake walk
compared to what will happen

641
00:54:46,820 --> 00:54:48,799
when William shows up.

642
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:50,833
All Jason did was buy us a little time.

643
00:54:52,271 --> 00:54:53,513
You best make use of it.

644
00:54:54,890 --> 00:54:57,290
Tell your people there's
still a lot to be done.

645
00:55:01,150 --> 00:55:02,929
I don't know what
you're all so smug about,

646
00:55:02,930 --> 00:55:05,269
but you just signed
your own death warrants.

647
00:55:05,270 --> 00:55:07,770
You should've taken Jason's
offer and surrendered.

648
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:12,859
Give it up, Reynaldo.

649
00:55:12,860 --> 00:55:15,369
They're not gonna listen to you anymore.

650
00:55:15,370 --> 00:55:17,239
Well, when William gets
here, they'll wish they had.

651
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:18,663
You mark my words, Emilio.

652
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:24,149
We have to find some way
to disassociate ourselves

653
00:55:24,150 --> 00:55:26,050
from these fools before it's too late.

654
00:55:30,457 --> 00:55:33,239
You know, there's two
things that smell like fish.

655
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:34,323
One of them's fish.

656
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:39,959
Ricardo, you remember that
blonde from the saloon

657
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:41,623
up in Kessel a couple years ago?

658
00:55:42,750 --> 00:55:43,730
How can I forget?

659
00:55:43,731 --> 00:55:45,359
You damn near got me killed.

660
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:48,319
Well, you're the one
that introduced me to her.

661
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:50,050
How was I supposed to
know she was married?

662
00:56:05,542 --> 00:56:07,570
Nah, she can't be married.

663
00:58:09,860 --> 00:58:11,693
No sign of that gas convoy, boss.

664
00:58:12,620 --> 00:58:14,089
How much water have we got?

665
00:58:14,090 --> 00:58:14,923
Not much.

666
00:58:14,924 --> 00:58:16,809
Drying up fast.

667
00:58:16,810 --> 00:58:18,710
We got enough fuel to get to Chinle?

668
00:58:19,930 --> 00:58:20,763
Yeah.

669
00:58:20,764 --> 00:58:21,993
Then let's move it out.

670
00:58:25,690 --> 00:58:26,690
Chinle!

671
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:01,720
Hey, Ricardo.

672
00:59:02,890 --> 00:59:03,949
Hey, Rick and I were thinking

673
00:59:03,950 --> 00:59:06,712
when this fighting is all
over, we'd like to go with you.

674
00:59:06,713 --> 00:59:09,779
For me, it is never over.

675
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:11,249
Yeah, we'd like to join you, though,

676
00:59:11,250 --> 00:59:13,300
become warriors and fight along side you.

677
00:59:14,310 --> 00:59:15,599
You will leave your homes?

678
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:17,469
Yeah, well, there's a lot
more to life than farming,

679
00:59:17,470 --> 00:59:18,819
that's for sure.

680
00:59:18,820 --> 00:59:21,289
But we can't stay home forever.

681
00:59:21,290 --> 00:59:24,039
Ricardo, why did you leave your home?

682
00:59:24,040 --> 00:59:28,903
I never had one, but if
I did, that's where I'd be.

683
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:48,469
How much time
do you think we have?

684
00:59:48,470 --> 00:59:51,629
Another day, if we're lucky.

685
00:59:51,630 --> 00:59:52,780
What's this?

686
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:57,339
Well, William thinks
Jason is holding the fort,

687
00:59:57,340 --> 00:59:59,540
so that'll just help convince him.

688
00:59:59,541 --> 01:00:01,379
When he gets nice and close,

689
01:00:01,380 --> 01:00:04,213
we hit him with everything we got.

690
01:00:44,988 --> 01:00:45,988
Roy!

691
01:00:49,220 --> 01:00:50,525
Smile.

692
01:00:50,526 --> 01:00:51,526
Wait.

693
01:00:56,110 --> 01:00:57,710
Try and make him feel welcome.

694
01:02:12,738 --> 01:02:14,627
Get off the car! Get off!

695
01:02:19,525 --> 01:02:21,498
Come on, come on!

696
01:02:41,094 --> 01:02:42,107
Fall back!

697
01:02:42,108 --> 01:02:43,108
Fall back!

698
01:03:16,750 --> 01:03:18,900
Take these assholes
back to the stockade.

699
01:03:20,190 --> 01:03:21,493
And no milk and cookies.

700
01:03:32,710 --> 01:03:33,710
Ricardo.

701
01:03:37,820 --> 01:03:41,319
Check out William's camp, see
what we're really up against.

702
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:44,603
If they got any water, use it up.

703
01:03:56,932 --> 01:03:58,265
Open the gate!

704
01:04:06,625 --> 01:04:07,680
I'm okay.

705
01:04:07,681 --> 01:04:08,681
Let's go.

706
01:04:17,940 --> 01:04:19,409
Check every vehicle.

707
01:04:19,410 --> 01:04:21,179
Check all the equipment.

708
01:04:21,180 --> 01:04:23,639
We attack in the morning in full force.

709
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:25,829
They won't drive me back this time.

710
01:04:25,830 --> 01:04:28,707
If I have to, I'll level Chinle.

711
01:04:37,507 --> 01:04:38,866
You know what to tell them.

712
01:04:38,867 --> 01:04:39,906
Yeah.

713
01:04:39,907 --> 01:04:41,439
Okay.

714
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:42,940
I'll take care of things here.

715
01:06:12,440 --> 01:06:13,739
What's this?

716
01:06:13,740 --> 01:06:15,529
An emissary from Chinle.

717
01:06:15,530 --> 01:06:18,566
He says he has important
information for you.

718
01:06:21,110 --> 01:06:22,639
He's the chief's son.

719
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:23,749
He helped me escape.

720
01:06:23,750 --> 01:06:26,010
He's okay.
I'll be the judge of that.

721
01:06:26,945 --> 01:06:28,326
Well?

722
01:06:28,327 --> 01:06:31,223
Son of chief, what do you got for me?

723
01:07:20,620 --> 01:07:22,120
I tell you, this is madness!

724
01:07:23,300 --> 01:07:25,849
This man is going to get us all killed

725
01:07:25,850 --> 01:07:27,629
because of some personal vendetta

726
01:07:27,630 --> 01:07:29,749
that has nothing to do with us.

727
01:07:29,750 --> 01:07:32,759
If we act now, we can
negotiate a reasonable truce,

728
01:07:32,760 --> 01:07:33,750
but if we wait...

729
01:07:33,751 --> 01:07:36,363
That what your son is
doing in William's camp?

730
01:07:37,250 --> 01:07:38,683
Negotiating a truce?

731
01:07:39,530 --> 01:07:41,929
Are you gonna follow a man
who'll sell you down the river

732
01:07:41,930 --> 01:07:43,443
just to save his own skin?

733
01:07:45,380 --> 01:07:46,743
William has no water!

734
01:07:48,120 --> 01:07:50,913
The longer we hold back his
army, the weaker it gets.

735
01:07:51,980 --> 01:07:53,039
Now, if we can hold him now,

736
01:07:53,040 --> 01:07:56,349
they'll never have the
strength to fight another day.

737
01:07:56,350 --> 01:07:59,509
When he hits us, it will be hard,

738
01:07:59,510 --> 01:08:02,449
but if we stand together
and hold our ground,

739
01:08:02,450 --> 01:08:04,566
we can beat this son of a bitch!

740
01:08:04,567 --> 01:08:06,114
- Yeah!
- Right, right!

741
01:08:56,654 --> 01:08:58,416
Move back!

742
01:08:58,417 --> 01:08:59,417
Back!

743
01:11:15,246 --> 01:11:16,246
Val!

744
01:12:21,220 --> 01:12:22,355
- Papa!
- Daniel!

745
01:12:55,114 --> 01:12:58,197
- Oh, yes, come here.
- Get over here.

746
01:12:59,119 --> 01:13:04,102
Let go!

747
01:13:12,640 --> 01:13:13,640
Take him away.

748
01:13:54,520 --> 01:13:57,394
William, William, William,

749
01:13:57,395 --> 01:13:59,562
William, William, William!

750
01:14:00,535 --> 01:14:02,202
So this is Chinle.

751
01:14:03,451 --> 01:14:04,770
They're gonna love us.

752
01:14:15,210 --> 01:14:17,199
Welcome to our humble village.

753
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:18,200
I'm Reynaldo.

754
01:14:20,120 --> 01:14:24,063
I trust my efforts to facilitate
you won't go unrewarded.

755
01:14:24,950 --> 01:14:26,529
Where are the rest of those mercenaries?

756
01:14:26,530 --> 01:14:27,699
They escaped.

757
01:14:27,700 --> 01:14:28,879
Whose their leader?

758
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:29,880
Michael.

759
01:14:33,400 --> 01:14:34,400
Michael?

760
01:14:37,340 --> 01:14:38,659
So what are we gonna do now?!

761
01:14:38,660 --> 01:14:42,241
We've got no food, no
water, and no transport!

762
01:14:43,950 --> 01:14:46,699
The outpost is a hundred miles away!

763
01:14:46,700 --> 01:14:47,680
We'd never make it!

764
01:14:47,681 --> 01:14:49,209
- We can try.
- We can always go back

765
01:14:49,210 --> 01:14:50,241
and surrender to William.

766
01:14:53,890 --> 01:14:57,013
Well, I'm going back,
but it ain't to surrender.

767
01:14:59,850 --> 01:15:01,299
Ricardo?

768
01:15:01,300 --> 01:15:03,665
It's either die out here like a dog,

769
01:15:03,666 --> 01:15:04,916
or down there like a man.

770
01:15:05,950 --> 01:15:07,239
I'm with John.

771
01:15:07,240 --> 01:15:08,399
I may be a scoundrel,

772
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:10,550
but I ain't never turn
my back on a friend.

773
01:15:13,120 --> 01:15:14,120
All right.

774
01:15:16,258 --> 01:15:17,258
We go tonight.

775
01:15:18,580 --> 01:15:20,211
Everybody stay out of the sun.

776
01:15:20,212 --> 01:15:21,962
Conserve your energy.

777
01:15:32,347 --> 01:15:35,703
I have no patience for failure, Jason,

778
01:15:36,760 --> 01:15:38,959
but in view of your past loyalty to me,

779
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:41,909
I'm giving you a chance
to redeem yourself.

780
01:15:41,910 --> 01:15:43,429
I thank you for that.

781
01:15:43,430 --> 01:15:46,179
Tomorrow morning, you'll
fight this young upstart Dorian

782
01:15:46,180 --> 01:15:48,209
in a duel to the death.

783
01:15:48,210 --> 01:15:49,739
And if you win, you'll be reinstated

784
01:15:49,740 --> 01:15:51,273
your position in my service.

785
01:15:52,130 --> 01:15:53,249
I'll win.

786
01:15:53,250 --> 01:15:56,009
I expect you to make short work of it.

787
01:15:56,010 --> 01:15:58,326
You won't be disappointed.

788
01:15:58,327 --> 01:15:59,377
And if Dorian wins?

789
01:16:01,090 --> 01:16:02,829
Why, I'm not an unreasonable man.

790
01:16:02,830 --> 01:16:05,129
His life will be spared.

791
01:16:05,130 --> 01:16:07,219
He'll spend the rest
of his days in slavery

792
01:16:07,220 --> 01:16:08,798
to the captains of my guard.

793
01:16:15,190 --> 01:16:16,190
Take them away.

794
01:16:43,150 --> 01:16:44,590
Son of a bitch.

795
01:16:47,411 --> 01:16:50,663
Well, can't say as I care
too much for the odds.

796
01:16:52,610 --> 01:16:54,630
No one here said it was gonna be easy.

797
01:17:07,890 --> 01:17:09,119
Never mind, I don't want any.

798
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:10,143
Put it down there.

799
01:17:30,780 --> 01:17:31,780
Daniel.

800
01:17:35,180 --> 01:17:36,013
Where did you get this?

801
01:17:36,014 --> 01:17:37,777
Up there, in the cave!

802
01:17:40,027 --> 01:17:41,286
Can you show me?

803
01:17:41,287 --> 01:17:42,287
Yes.

804
01:17:54,157 --> 01:17:55,157
In there.

805
01:18:40,458 --> 01:18:41,458
There.

806
01:19:20,430 --> 01:19:21,430
Whoa.

807
01:19:22,297 --> 01:19:23,373
Elusive jackpot.

808
01:19:26,920 --> 01:19:28,233
Do you know how to use that?

809
01:19:29,320 --> 01:19:31,220
Yeah, if they're not all rusted out.

810
01:19:44,760 --> 01:19:47,603
Ricardo, we're in business.

811
01:20:10,975 --> 01:20:12,163
Val.

812
01:20:12,164 --> 01:20:14,164
What are you doing here?

813
01:20:15,065 --> 01:20:17,183
I had to see you.

814
01:20:17,184 --> 01:20:18,845
I'm scared.

815
01:20:18,846 --> 01:20:19,846
Don't be.

816
01:20:20,795 --> 01:20:23,073
This is all my fault.

817
01:20:23,074 --> 01:20:25,333
Hey, Jason's not gonna kill me.

818
01:20:26,454 --> 01:20:27,954
I've got too much to live for.

819
01:20:30,823 --> 01:20:33,410
Yeah, but even if you win...

820
01:20:34,770 --> 01:20:36,149
Hey, as long as I'm alive,

821
01:20:36,150 --> 01:20:38,213
I'll find a way for us to be together.

822
01:20:39,270 --> 01:20:40,270
I swear.

823
01:20:51,260 --> 01:20:52,260
Val!

824
01:21:40,844 --> 01:21:43,094
This is for you, William.

825
01:22:03,755 --> 01:22:05,133
Yeah, yeah!

826
01:22:05,134 --> 01:22:06,223
Kill the motherfucker!

827
01:22:06,224 --> 01:22:08,141
Cut his nuts off! Yeah!

828
01:22:27,512 --> 01:22:28,345
Yeah!

829
01:22:28,346 --> 01:22:30,762
Kick that motherfucker's ass!

830
01:22:46,277 --> 01:22:48,022
Kill! Yeah!

831
01:23:02,700 --> 01:23:04,117
- Val!
- Incoming!

832
01:27:39,071 --> 01:27:40,640
He's yours.

833
01:28:11,700 --> 01:28:14,510
Chinle owes you so much.

834
01:28:14,511 --> 01:28:15,511
I wish you'd stay.

835
01:28:16,320 --> 01:28:18,409
Still so much that we can learn from you.

836
01:28:18,410 --> 01:28:20,260
Whatever you need to know you know.

837
01:28:21,900 --> 01:28:22,950
My work is done here.

838
01:28:23,908 --> 01:28:25,399
It's time for me to move on.

839
01:28:25,400 --> 01:28:26,400
Thanks.

840
01:28:28,199 --> 01:28:29,749
- Ow.
- Thanks for everything.

841
01:28:30,940 --> 01:28:32,029
We appreciate it.

842
01:28:41,446 --> 01:28:44,069
Take care of him now.

843
01:28:44,070 --> 01:28:45,070
She will.

844
01:29:32,246 --> 01:29:34,269
I thought you were staying.

845
01:29:34,270 --> 01:29:35,929
Not my style.

846
01:29:35,930 --> 01:29:36,920
I'm a gambling man.

847
01:29:36,921 --> 01:29:40,169
You know, kid, it's not too
late to change your mind.

848
01:29:40,170 --> 01:29:43,011
Big tournament up in
Bonetown, we could clean up.

849
01:29:43,012 --> 01:29:44,012
I don't think so.

850
01:29:45,572 --> 01:29:46,572
Bye.

851
01:29:51,612 --> 01:29:54,543
