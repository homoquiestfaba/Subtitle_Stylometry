1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000

3
00:00:10,468 --> 00:00:13,805
(emotional piano music)

4
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:51,110
(traffic hums)

5
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:57,033
- [Woman Voiceover] You
ever look up and realize

6
00:01:57,033 --> 00:02:00,745
you're like 12 exits
further than you thought,

7
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:03,623
and on a totally different parkway?

8
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,502
Sometimes, I think I'm
gonna wake up and realize

9
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:10,713
I'm still eight years
old, and the last 14 years

10
00:02:10,713 --> 00:02:12,882
have been my imagination.

11
00:02:12,882 --> 00:02:14,217
- What a relief.

12
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:18,054
(driver sniffles)

13
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:23,685
- [Woman Voiceover] My mom always told me,

14
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:25,812
when you're trying to make a decision,

15
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:28,773
follow your stomach, not your heart.

16
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:31,359
Whatever path makes you
less sick to your stomach

17
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:32,861
is the right one.

18
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:34,946
(playful music)

19
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:36,698
- You were named after
my mother's sisters,

20
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:38,658
you know that, Sara and Beth.

21
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:42,579
Sara was a mother of five beautiful boys,

22
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:45,707
and Beth was an artist, just like you.

23
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,586
They all died at Auschwitz.

24
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:54,632
- For some reason, I'm ruled by guilt.

25
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,303
That's what makes me an activist.

26
00:02:58,303 --> 00:03:01,890
I feel responsible for
the world around me.

27
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:07,645
My parents think I'm dark in spirit,

28
00:03:07,645 --> 00:03:10,899
but noticing evil isn't so pessimistic

29
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:14,277
if you think you can change things.

30
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:18,198
I've never been that popular,
and, now that I'm grown up,

31
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:20,033
I'm a feminist artist.

32
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:23,453
And I'm even less popular.

33
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:32,128
Another neato gadget for middle-aged men

34
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:33,004
to buy at the mall?

35
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:35,089
- Another biting protest for feminists

36
00:03:35,089 --> 00:03:37,341
who already agree with you?

37
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:41,262
- Someday, the religious
right will hate me.

38
00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:42,555
Someday, there will be assassination

39
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:45,016
attempts on my life, yes.

40
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:46,643
What is that rocket gonna do for you?

41
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:49,437
- Well, some people think
this crap's actually useful.

42
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:52,941
Yeah, that's why I have a
job lined up after school.

43
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:57,070
- So, that thing like flies
and lights up and stuff?

44
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:01,950
- Would it impress if I gave
you a demonstration and stuff?

45
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,618
- I don't know.

46
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:04,786
Let me see it.

47
00:04:09,123 --> 00:04:11,876
The best ideas take you by surprise.

48
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:13,461
Can I borrow this?

49
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:14,420
Thanks.

50
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,172
- What the hell did you do to my rocket?

51
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:17,839
- [Sarabeth] And the best revolutionaries

52
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,591
challenge each other.

53
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:24,180
(Sarabeth laughs)

54
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,015
I got it. (laughs)

55
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:30,186
My final college thesis was
on progress and evolution.

56
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:34,607
Then I graduated, and moved
back home with my family.

57
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:36,484
- [Mother] Aren't you done yet

58
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:37,694
rebelling against your parents?

59
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:39,696
- Are you crazy, you made this?

60
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:42,031
Take this down, or move out.

61
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:46,159
- If you're gonna censor me
as an artist, I might have to.

62
00:04:46,159 --> 00:04:47,412
- Taking out a second mortgage to send you

63
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:48,955
to some fancy design college,

64
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:50,999
is that how we censor you as an artist?

65
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:52,457
- Religion thrives at the cost

66
00:04:52,457 --> 00:04:54,460
of the female spirit and body.

67
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,671
- What would Sara and Beth think?

68
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:59,882
- Can't you ever just
let them rest in peace?

69
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:03,011
- You have no right to
disgrace them like this.

70
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:05,346
- All right, all right!

71
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:06,306
- You know what the Talmud says,

72
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,391
"If I'm not for myself,
who will be for me?"

73
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:09,267
- [Sarabeth] I know, Dad.

74
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:11,728
- If Jews are not for
ourselves, believe me,

75
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:13,521
nobody will be for us.

76
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:16,858
My mother was lucky to survive
and make it to this country.

77
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:19,861
Otherwise, none of us would be here!

78
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,407
- I'm from Brooklyn.

79
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:28,036
I spent my childhood staring
across the river at Manhattan,

80
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:30,330
knowing that there were
these great artists

81
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,581
right there, shaking things up,

82
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:35,168
wishing I was right there with them.

83
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:37,920
Now I'm back in Brooklyn.

84
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,548
Only 30 minutes away by subway,

85
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:42,008
but the promised land has always been

86
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:43,468
just beyond my reach.

87
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:46,054
(upbeat music)

88
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:53,770
- Commuting halfway across Brooklyn

89
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:56,105
for a waitressing job, are you crazy?

90
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:57,106
- Well, it's close to Manhattan.

91
00:05:57,106 --> 00:06:01,152
I'll be living there soon
enough, if I can just save up.

92
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:03,780
All right, Ma, half of this
is gonna wind up in the trash.

93
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,406
Starving children in America, you know.

94
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:06,324
- Smart-alec.

95
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:08,785
You're too smart to be
serving people all day long.

96
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:09,911
- So are you.

97
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:12,413
- Waitressing, after four
years of this fancy college?

98
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:13,539
Ruthie, get me a razor blade.

99
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:15,708
I gotta scrap the college
sticker off my station wagon.

100
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:18,044
- Not a regular waiter, a cater waiter.

101
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:19,295
They make really good money.

102
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:22,173
- Oh, I see, this really
is a brilliant career move.

103
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:23,966
- I only have to work four nights a week,

104
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:25,593
leaving my days free
to paint in the light.

105
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:27,220
Don't you understand how
important this is to me?

106
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,596
- Sweetheart, if you
become an art teacher,

107
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:31,140
you get to take the whole
summer off to paint.

108
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:33,101
- Customers treat waitresses like crap.

109
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:34,143
Sarabeth, you're not gonna like it.

110
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:36,187
You don't even like helping
your mother in the kitchen.

111
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:37,522
- Ain't that the truth.

112
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:41,025
(light, percussive music)

113
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:43,569
- [Sarabeth Voiceover] I don't know why

114
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:45,863
my mother is so surprised.

115
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:50,118
She's been training me for
this job my entire life.

116
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:52,620
During the holidays, she turns

117
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:55,289
my sisters and me into servants.

118
00:06:57,707 --> 00:07:00,128
What's wrong with being paid for it?

119
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:01,629
- [Ruthie] Careful, Sarabeth.

120
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:02,880
Easy, watch it!

121
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,925
- Okay, you don't have to yell.

122
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:07,969
- Maybe I should prepare
for Passover all by myself.

123
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:09,303
- Is that supposed to be a threat?

124
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:10,680
- Very funny.

125
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,807
- Sarabeth, why don't you
just do the silverware?

126
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:13,891
- [Ruthie] I would think
you'd be better at this,

127
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:15,059
considering your new line of work.

128
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:16,018
- You know what, if
you don't like waiters,

129
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:18,271
maybe you shouldn't go
to restaurants anymore.

130
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,105
- What kind of men are you going to meet

131
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:20,398
in that environment, huh?

132
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:22,400
- Mom, my boyfriend is
on his way over here.

133
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,152
- [Ruthie] I mean a man that
you would consider marrying.

134
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:26,487
- Ma, she just got out of
school, leave her alone.

135
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:28,739
- Yeah, why do you wanna
marry me off so bad anyways?

136
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:30,032
You're not getting a dowry for me.

137
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:32,659
- I wanna see you safe
and settled and secure

138
00:07:32,659 --> 00:07:35,329
with somebody that cares about you.

139
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:37,039
You're not getting any younger, you know.

140
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,249
I can't do this forever.

141
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:40,543
- Mom, we can take care of ourselves.

142
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,836
We do take care of ourselves.

143
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:42,837
- Would it be so terrible to see

144
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:44,422
a few Jewish grandchildren
running around here,

145
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:46,549
from any of you?

146
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:49,093
Children, I want these
dishes very well organized.

147
00:07:49,093 --> 00:07:50,428
Look at the way Becky's doing this,

148
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:51,846
perfect, perfect!
- Please.

149
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:52,680
- Perfect, my darling.
- Perfect little Becky.

150
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,307
- [Ruthie] In eight days, we
gotta put these dishes back.

151
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:56,267
We've been doing this since
you were a little girl.

152
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:58,769
- Do you ever feel like the
Torah invents extra housework?

153
00:07:58,769 --> 00:08:01,772
- Oh, please, I don't do half
of what my mother used to do,

154
00:08:01,772 --> 00:08:03,608
and she didn't do half of
what Grandma used to do.

155
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:05,401
You know what they say, something is lost-

156
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:07,403
- In every generation.

157
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:09,989
- What, do you think that
Daddy's the only religious one?

158
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:11,032
What am I?

159
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:14,535
Just some schlub that does
all the housework, what?

160
00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:18,539
When do I ever forget to
separate milk form meat?

161
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:22,585
When do I ever forget
to keep God in my mind?

162
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:24,253
- Cracking the whip!

163
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,548
- It keeps you very spiritual.

164
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:30,968
- What, slave labor is spiritual?

165
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:32,720
- Living your life
according to your beliefs

166
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,597
and not just running off at the mouth is.

167
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:36,765
- This is exactly why I'm
against organized religion.

168
00:08:36,765 --> 00:08:39,184
- Right, we're brainwashed
and you're an original.

169
00:08:39,184 --> 00:08:40,686
I don't know one kid that hasn't graduated

170
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:41,938
from university that doesn't wanna do away

171
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:43,563
with organized religion.

172
00:08:43,563 --> 00:08:45,983
Down with organized religion,
down with capitalism,

173
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:47,944
down with health
insurance, until, one day,

174
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:50,530
you get by a truck, God forbid,

175
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,156
and then, my darling Sarabeth,

176
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:54,867
then you will see that
life is not so simple.

177
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:56,661
- Ma, why can't Dad help?

178
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:57,870
Why can't Howie help?

179
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,288
Where's he at, huh?

180
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:00,748
Simon's coming over in enough time

181
00:09:00,748 --> 00:09:03,543
to help with the cleanup and the setup.

182
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,670
We're equal partners,
and we always will be.

183
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:06,587
- I bet the Pope

184
00:09:06,587 --> 00:09:08,214
would be proud.
(doorbell rings)

185
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:09,131
- Oh, God.

186
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:10,132
Ma, be nice.

187
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:12,051
You invited him.

188
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:13,052
- I'll be cordial.

189
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:15,096
I'll really be cordial if you bring me

190
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:16,931
a gorgeous medical student

191
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:19,141
as brilliant as you, my sweetheart.

192
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:21,727
Then I'll really be cordial, I promise.

193
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:26,023
- [Sarabeth] Mom, Becky,
Raquel, this is Simon.

194
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:27,358
- Well.
- Hi, Simon.

195
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:28,234
- [Simon] Hi.

196
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:29,068
- How do you do?

197
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:29,902
- All right, nice to meet you, Mrs. Cohen.

198
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:31,153
- And you.
- These are for you.

199
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:32,738
- Oh, my heavens, thank you so much.

200
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:33,573
- [Raquel] Have a seat, Simon.

201
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:34,448
Can we get you something to drink?

202
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:35,491
- No, actually, I'm good.

203
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:37,493
I came early so that I can help,

204
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:39,328
so what needs to be done?

205
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:41,163
- [Becky] We are in the
middle of changing the dishes

206
00:09:41,163 --> 00:09:42,498
and cleaning the cabinets.

207
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:44,250
- [Ruthie] Oh my God, I
didn't realize it was so late!

208
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,251
- We're on top of it, Mom.

209
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:47,587
Come on, I'll wash, you
dry, we'll get it done.

210
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:48,629
- Good Yomtov.

211
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:51,674
I see every car I have
ever owned in the driveway.

212
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:53,593
That must mean my girls are home.

213
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,177
Is there an almost-doctor in the house?

214
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:57,847
- Why, you finally wanna
get that cough checked out?

215
00:09:57,847 --> 00:10:01,100
- [Dad] As soon as you
check your smart mouth.

216
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,518
- [Sarabeth] Hi, Daddy.

217
00:10:02,518 --> 00:10:04,729
- Hi, (speaking foreign language).

218
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:06,564
- Daddy, Simon Stanton.

219
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:07,857
Simon, Isaac Cohen.

220
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:08,983
- I thought his name was Christianson

221
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:09,859
or something like that.

222
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:10,901
- Dad!

223
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:11,902
- I can't keep up, I'm sorry.

224
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:13,529
I'm still waiting for Becky's husband

225
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:16,699
and Raquel's kids and the Messiah, so.

226
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:19,368
- [Raquel] You'll probably
see the Messiah first.

227
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:21,203
- Listen, I'll take anything
as long as it arrives

228
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:22,371
before I die.

229
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:23,247
- Ma!

230
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:26,250
- In the words of Spinoza,
the secret to life

231
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,002
is that it stops.

232
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:29,837
- That's Kafka, Daddy.

233
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,048
- You send your kids to school,

234
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:33,007
and how do they thank you?

235
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:34,467
They become wise-apples and throw

236
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:35,718
their knowledge back at you,

237
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:37,136
and, the more years they spend in school,

238
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:40,056
the more they throw back in your face.

239
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:42,141
How's this apartment search working out?

240
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:45,102
- Horrible, I can't
even find a dumpy studio

241
00:10:45,102 --> 00:10:47,438
with a shared bathroom.

242
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:51,442
- Maybe Becky will be of help with this.

243
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:53,986
- My roommate just moved out on me.

244
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:56,947
Maybe you can stay with me temporarily.

245
00:10:56,947 --> 00:10:58,199
- Really?

246
00:10:58,199 --> 00:10:59,950
That would be awesome.

247
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:01,786
- I know you wanted to be downtown,

248
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:04,205
but it's right by Columbia.

249
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:05,373
It's a pretty fun area.

250
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:07,958
- I can pick up extra
shifts at the restaurant!

251
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:09,001
- Great.
- It's a mitzvah.

252
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:10,252
- It's too bad that
Howard isn't as motivated

253
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:12,254
as Sarabeth to work.

254
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:14,340
- Ma, he is working, very hard.

255
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,676
- Working hard, spending
your money working hard.

256
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:18,094
- You don't even know
what you're talking about.

257
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:19,136
- I don't?
- No.

258
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:20,388
- So why are you always broke?

259
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:22,056
Where is your money?

260
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:24,975
And what are you kids gonna do
when you wanna have a child?

261
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:28,104
- Ruthie, he's just having
trouble starting a business.

262
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:29,188
- Ma, he's working with his brother

263
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:30,856
every day, every weekend.

264
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:32,358
- That brother, that
brother's the worst thing

265
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:33,651
that could happen to either of you.

266
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:34,985
The farther that you stay
away from that brother,

267
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:35,820
the better it is.

268
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,363
- Why are you so hard on him?

269
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:38,197
- Instinct.

270
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:40,783
- He tries so hard to get you to like him.

271
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:42,535
Why do you think he's
always walking around

272
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:45,079
opening jars and squashing bugs for you?

273
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:47,039
And you never make him feel welcome, ever.

274
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,332
- [Man Voiceover] Hello, hello?

275
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:49,290
- All right, subject
close, subject closed.

276
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:50,376
Hello, Howard!

277
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:52,586
- Hi, princess.
- Hi, honey.

278
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:56,632
Good Yomtov, everyone, I
brought some macaroons.

279
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:58,384
- [Ruthie] Aw, that's
lovely of you, Howard.

280
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:00,219
Welcome, Howard, welcome.
- Thank you very much.

281
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:01,095
Thank you.

282
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:02,263
If there's anything you need me to do,

283
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:03,764
you'll let me know.
- Yes.

284
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:06,600
- Any jars that need opened?

285
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,852
- Not yet.

286
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:09,812
Oh, Howard, have you met Simon?

287
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:10,980
This is Sarabeth's boyfriend.

288
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:11,814
- Hi.
- Hey.

289
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:12,690
- How are you doing, Simon.
- Howie.

290
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:15,151
- Her Catholic boyfriend.

291
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:16,485
- I'm sorry about her.

292
00:12:16,485 --> 00:12:18,070
I'm sorry about all of them.

293
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,822
They are freaks!

294
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:21,991
You know, they don't know how
to behave in front of company.

295
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:24,285
It's so embarrassing!

296
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:25,703
When the Seder's over,
we'll just come back

297
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:27,913
up here and hide.
- Okay, stop.

298
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:30,040
So you're really excited about New York?

299
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,459
That's what you want forever?

300
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:33,711
- Yeah, I'm really excited.

301
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:35,963
Manhattan.

302
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:40,384
- You know, sometimes, I can't look at you

303
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:43,721
without thinking about forever.

304
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:46,182
Does that scare you?

305
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:47,767
- It's kinda scary.

306
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:53,314
I mean, it's all scary
and exciting, you know?

307
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:55,149
It's like being on a rollercoaster

308
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:57,067
and that feeling you get in your stomach

309
00:12:57,067 --> 00:12:58,861
right before the drop.

310
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:04,325
- Well, tonight, each one
pours another person's glass,

311
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:08,996
just to remind us that
we are no longer slaves.

312
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:10,164
Why?

313
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:13,584
Because we have to treat each other

314
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:15,586
with a sense of decency.

315
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:19,131
And now for the (speaking
foreign language).

316
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:23,385
(family sings in foreign language)

317
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:29,308
- [Ruthie] Drink up, drink up.

318
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:34,522
- On this night, every Jew should imagine,

319
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:37,733
should personalize, and
personalize this intimately,

320
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:40,569
what it would be to be freed from Egypt.

321
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:44,824
- I'm finally getting
out of my parents' house!

322
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:46,826
So, I move in April 1st.

323
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:51,330
Smack in the middle of
my sister's living room.

324
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,665
- Welcome to New York, baby.

325
00:13:53,665 --> 00:13:55,626
- My boyfriend is never
gonna want to visit me.

326
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:58,504
He just got this new apartment
over his uncle's garage.

327
00:13:58,504 --> 00:13:59,797
- Honey, you can't afford New York

328
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:01,966
without a major sacrifice.

329
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:03,801
- Or a trust fund.

330
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:07,346
- Well, she said I could
have the walk-in closet.

331
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:08,889
- [Waitress] So?

332
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:10,474
- I'm thinking of making that my bedroom.

333
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:11,684
I mean, it's only six by four,

334
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:14,103
but it fits a mattress,
and at least it has a door.

335
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:16,230
- I haven't had a door
since I moved to New York.

336
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:17,481
- You haven't?

337
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:19,900
- I live in a studio
with six other dancers.

338
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,652
- That's fucked up.
- Yeah, I'm one of them.

339
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:23,404
Gina lives alone.

340
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:24,530
- Yeah, right.

341
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:27,741
Not if you count the
mice and the cockroaches.

342
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:29,201
Sweetie, you'll be fine.

343
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:32,204
(upbeat jazz music)

344
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:53,267
- I can't imagine how you're gonna find

345
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:55,102
room to unpack all this.

346
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:56,854
I thought you said this
living room was big.

347
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:58,022
- For New York.

348
00:14:58,022 --> 00:15:00,608
- And this apartment is
considered a good deal.

349
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:01,650
When I came to this country,

350
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:04,361
we moved to the city because
it's all we could afford.

351
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:08,616
Who knew I was so glamorous and
cosmopolitan before my time?

352
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:10,200
- Yeah, I think we've
seen this episode, Dad.

353
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,243
- You know, Simon, for
what they could sell

354
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:14,163
this apartment for, we could
buy two houses on Long Island,

355
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:17,374
three houses upstate, and
five houses in Atlantic City.

356
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:19,293
- Yeah, and trade them all in for a hotel.

357
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:21,003
(Isaac laughs)

358
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:24,798
- Good one, Christianson,
good one, not bad for a goy.

359
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:26,884
- Stanton, Simon Stanton.

360
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:29,345
- You're all right, kid.

361
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:31,138
Sarabeth, believe me, I feel so good

362
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:32,640
knowing he'll be looking out for you.

363
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,308
- I'll look out for me, Dad.

364
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:36,644
- [Becky] Yeah, Dad, I think
we can take it form here.

365
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:37,853
- Oh, I get it, I get it.

366
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:39,146
Like they say in Vaudeville,

367
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:41,065
"Here's your hat, what's your hurry?"

368
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:42,399
Simon, I remember the days when they used

369
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:45,694
to fight over my time for piggyback rides.

370
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:47,863
All right.
- Thanks, Daddy.

371
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:51,367
- Use it in good health,
and, most importantly,

372
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:52,993
be safe.

373
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:55,454
Take care of them, Simon, will you?

374
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:57,039
Bye bye, princesses.

375
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:58,374
- Goodnight, Dad.
- Thanks, Dad.

376
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:01,126
- [Sarabeth] Thanks, Dad.

377
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:04,421
- I have six chapters to
read for my eight am class,

378
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:07,466
so I'm I'm gonna go in my room.

379
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:11,345
- Have fun studying.
- Night, you two.

380
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:12,596
- So, now what?

381
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:18,102
- Well, we go to my luxurious new bedroom.

382
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:22,481
(door creaks)

383
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:32,700
- This is nice.

384
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:39,123
- [Sarabeth Voiceover] Finally, I'm right

385
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:41,208
where I'm supposed to be.

386
00:16:43,877 --> 00:16:47,214
Now, make something brilliant.

387
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:52,136
So much to say, and only eight
million people to say it to.

388
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:55,347
Paris had impressionists,

389
00:16:56,932 --> 00:16:58,684
London had romantics,

390
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:05,232
and, for better or worse, New York,

391
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:08,986
the capital of attitude, has me.

392
00:17:14,324 --> 00:17:17,202
- Well, honey, I guess I'm going

393
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:19,579
to have to be the one to break it to you.

394
00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:22,583
Female anger, demands for equality,

395
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:26,795
rebelling against men,
all very early '90s.

396
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:30,174
I'm afraid I won't be able to sell these.

397
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:31,258
- Okay, well.

398
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:38,599
What about that one?

399
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:47,066
- Well, these are a little too optimistic.

400
00:17:48,108 --> 00:17:49,735
See, in the art world, remember,

401
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:52,112
cynicism never goes out of style.

402
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:53,822
You just have to keep
up with what it's hip

403
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:55,491
to be cynical about.

404
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:02,498
- [Becky] Wow, what's this?

405
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:04,833
- Oh, just something I made.

406
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:07,377
- This is funny.

407
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:11,381
You should do more stuff
like this, fun stuff.

408
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:13,717
You're really funny.

409
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:15,052
- What, you don't like
when I question things

410
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:16,053
with my art?

411
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:19,348
That's right, you don't question anything.

412
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:23,268
- Relax, I was trying to
give you a compliment.

413
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:28,357
(train clacks)

414
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:35,280
- [Simon Voiceover] It's a bit of a drive

415
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,990
from the train stations, but
it's nice up here, right?

416
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:37,825
- Yeah.

417
00:18:39,993 --> 00:18:41,745
This is so perfect.

418
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:43,455
Some weekends, you can come to New York

419
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:46,291
for culture and excitement,
and other weekends,

420
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:50,712
I can come here for hiking
and biking and inspiration.

421
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:53,298
(gentle music)

422
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:02,558
Oh, man, are they serious?

423
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:04,184
You gotta pay a toll over here?

424
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:05,853
- Well, us rednecks need
to pay for our roads

425
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:07,521
somehow, too, Missy.

426
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:10,399
Hi.

427
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:19,283
I haven't even shown you the best part.

428
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:22,536
(gentle, upbeat music)

429
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:30,043
Wait, wait.

430
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:33,297
Ready?

431
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:36,758
Keep them closed, keep them closed.

432
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:38,677
All right, right there.

433
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:39,803
Open up!

434
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:40,846
Check out all the shit I bought!

435
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:42,639
- Wow.
- I got a plant, a TV,

436
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:44,349
a VCR, a DVD player, stereo,

437
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:46,894
and they're all hooked
up to these speakers.

438
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:49,188
- Where?
- They go here, and here.

439
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:50,522
And, the best thing is that I got it all

440
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:52,107
on my first two paychecks.

441
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:53,317
- How are you gonna pay your rent?

442
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:55,360
- No, my rent's cheap, yeah.

443
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,737
The way that the whole work thing goes

444
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:58,530
is that I get paid next week

445
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:00,240
and the week after that
and the week after that.

446
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,491
It just keeps going.

447
00:20:01,491 --> 00:20:02,618
Yeah, yeah.

448
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:04,995
So now we can watch movies,
and we never have to leave.

449
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:06,663
- Cool!

450
00:20:06,663 --> 00:20:09,666
(upbeat jazz music)

451
00:20:14,796 --> 00:20:17,466
All the waiters here
are struggling artists,

452
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:19,843
and every one of us
thinks that we're the one

453
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:21,595
that's gonna make it.

454
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:26,558
And every restaurant in
New York is the same way.

455
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:30,062
The most creative people serve drinks

456
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:32,064
to the most boring ones.

457
00:20:33,857 --> 00:20:37,194
But it's okay, we're all in it together.

458
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:40,948
- Sarabeth, why do you
have so much laundry?

459
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:44,409
- Don't you feel like this
takes you away from composing?

460
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:46,745
- I'm saying, it'd be nice
to have a maid, but, uh.

461
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:49,414
- Yeah, it'd be nice to
have a social life, too.

462
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:50,624
- You know, it's frustrating,

463
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:53,835
but I'm under the belief,
that when you're an artist,

464
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:56,338
a part of you is creating every minute.

465
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:58,465
Like, for example, listen to the sound

466
00:20:58,465 --> 00:21:00,550
the wheels are making on the sidewalk.

467
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:05,555
(percussive music)
(Gina grunts)

468
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:08,183
Here we go, yeah.

469
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:09,685
Right?

470
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:11,311
- [Sarabeth] You're
never selling this song.

471
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:14,940
(percussive music)

472
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,149
- [Gina] One day, one day, we won't

473
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:17,567
have to do this anymore.

474
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:20,487
(percussive music)

475
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:23,282
- [Sarabeth] Hey.

476
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:24,116
- Hey.

477
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:29,746
- [Sarabeth] What is that?

478
00:21:29,746 --> 00:21:31,707
- Dinner from Mom.

479
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:32,666
- Why?

480
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:35,877
- [Becky] She sends it every week.

481
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:39,131
- She sends mashed potatoes and turkey?

482
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:42,634
The kid in medical school gets everything.

483
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:44,261
- She would've sent
you meals in your dorm,

484
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:46,763
but you always said no.

485
00:21:46,763 --> 00:21:48,682
- I thought everyone said no.

486
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:51,393
- Not everyone is as dumb as you.

487
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:54,313
(percussive music)

488
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:43,362
- I know.

489
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:46,615
I'm trying to paint something patriotic,

490
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:49,701
but I can't do that
without being sarcastic.

491
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:52,204
(Becky and Sarabeth chuckle)

492
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:53,705
It's not funny.

493
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:56,500
Simon's mom is having this
big 4th of July party,

494
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,960
and I can't show up empty-handed.

495
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,255
- Well, why don't you just
take a bottle of wine?

496
00:23:02,255 --> 00:23:07,260
(people chatter)
(light music)

497
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:23,610
- [Dad] Well, hello, is
this the famous little lady

498
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:24,945
from New York City?

499
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:26,530
- Dad, Sarabeth, Sarabeth.

500
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:27,864
- Hi, nice to meet you.
- Bill Stanton.

501
00:23:27,864 --> 00:23:28,824
And Mom, hey, Mom.

502
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:30,534
- Oh, hi, sweetie.
- Maddie Stanton.

503
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:32,786
- Hi, pleased to meet you.

504
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:35,372
- Oh, how fancy, wine at a BBQ.

505
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:39,251
Thank you.

506
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:40,210
- New York City style.

507
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:41,711
- And my sister Stacey Stanton.

508
00:23:41,711 --> 00:23:42,546
- Hi.
- Hi.

509
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:43,380
Nice to meet you.
- Sarabeth.

510
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,048
And her boyfriend Tony.
- Hi.

511
00:23:45,048 --> 00:23:46,258
- Happy Independence Day.

512
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:47,092
- Hey, Tony.
- Hey.

513
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:48,593
- It's my favorite holiday.

514
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:51,805
And I have some amazing news.

515
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:55,809
Tony just proposed to me,
we're getting married!

516
00:23:57,769 --> 00:23:59,396
- She's the luckiest girl in the world.

517
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:00,647
- [Bill] You better treat
my little girl well,

518
00:24:00,647 --> 00:24:02,107
ya big fuck-up!

519
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:04,067
- [Maddie] I'm gonna cry.

520
00:24:04,067 --> 00:24:06,403
- It's really cool to
finally meet you, Sarabeth.

521
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:08,947
You know, we could be
sisters-in-law someday.

522
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:11,575
- Yeah, and then you'd be the
luckiest girl in the world.

523
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:12,534
(Stacey chuckles)

524
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:16,371
- Happy 4th of July! (laughs)

525
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:21,001
- Why don't we celebrate July 4th, Daddy?

526
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:22,461
- Because it's silly
patriotism, that's why.

527
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:23,378
It leads to fascism.

528
00:24:23,378 --> 00:24:26,131
When we Jews hear loud
explosions like this,

529
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:28,258
we always think the big
government is out to get us.

530
00:24:28,258 --> 00:24:29,176
- We do?

531
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:30,135
Sounds a bit paranoid.

532
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:31,720
- Where'd you learn that word?

533
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,055
- Woody Allen says, "It's not paranoia

534
00:24:34,055 --> 00:24:35,807
"if everyone's out to get ya."

535
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:39,769
(fireworks pop)
- Ooh!

536
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:42,189
(people shout)

537
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:43,523
- Come on, Sarabeth, come on!

538
00:24:43,523 --> 00:24:44,816
- Well, now that my
girlfriend lives in New York,

539
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:46,818
I can get my fireworks from Chinatown.

540
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:49,237
- Oh, those chinks know
how to blow stuff up.

541
00:24:49,237 --> 00:24:50,906
- Hey, that's not funny now
that they've been stealing

542
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:52,949
all our military secrets
and shit over there.

543
00:24:52,949 --> 00:24:54,784
- Tony, take it easy.
- Like the fucking war machine

544
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:57,037
Jew Israelis.
- Yo, shut the fuck up.

545
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:58,622
- Fucking Jews always fucking us sup.

546
00:24:58,622 --> 00:24:59,789
- What, shut the fuck up!

547
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:00,624
- It's true, I'm just saying.
- That's enough,

548
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:01,791
that's enough.

549
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:05,962
No fighting on our nation's birthday.

550
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:14,596
- Baby, he didn't mean anything by it.

551
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:16,056
- Not directly.

552
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:17,140
- I thought we didn't have religion.

553
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:19,017
I don't understand why
you're getting so upset.

554
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:23,271
- He insulted my family,
he insulted my ancestors.

555
00:25:23,271 --> 00:25:25,607
Simon, this guy's marrying your sister.

556
00:25:25,607 --> 00:25:28,318
- He's a good guy, he
just got a little wasted.

557
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:32,697
- You know, the thing is,
is that, if I wasn't there,

558
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:37,118
I don't think anyone would
have been mad at him.

559
00:25:37,118 --> 00:25:39,955
It's like it's never
uncool to knock down a Jew

560
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:42,249
unless another Jew is there.

561
00:25:43,124 --> 00:25:47,462
- Sarabeth, your family is
way more prejudiced than mine.

562
00:25:47,462 --> 00:25:50,048
(traffic hums)

563
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:02,477
- Why do Mom and Dad have to call Simon

564
00:26:02,477 --> 00:26:05,480
a goy every time they see him?

565
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,440
- They're just calling him mainstream,

566
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,277
like they're calling him "the man."

567
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:15,073
They have a watch-your-backs
attitude about "the man."

568
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:16,741
- You're so hip-hop.

569
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:20,245
- Mom's just trying to protect you.

570
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:23,290
- It's like she doesn't even
realize that she's oppressed.

571
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:25,250
- Come on, Sarabeth.

572
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,626
Don't you remember the
stories she's always telling

573
00:26:26,626 --> 00:26:29,838
about Grandma and the haystack?

574
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:32,632
- Don't you think we dwell
on that a little too much?

575
00:26:32,632 --> 00:26:33,883
- Just because something's older than you

576
00:26:33,883 --> 00:26:36,386
doesn't mean it's out of date.

577
00:26:38,054 --> 00:26:40,640
- Your great-grandmother Ada, she survived

578
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,309
these pogroms, and, God
knows, she would want

579
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:44,603
you to know about them.

580
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:48,231
There were these mean
soldiers called the Cossacks,

581
00:26:48,231 --> 00:26:51,443
and they would come on horseback,

582
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:54,696
and they would attack the Jews.

583
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:57,699
And the so-called police,
you know what they would do?

584
00:26:57,699 --> 00:26:59,534
Sometimes, here, I'll help you,

585
00:26:59,534 --> 00:27:01,578
sometimes, they would
side with the attackers.

586
00:27:01,578 --> 00:27:03,872
Sometimes, they even were the attackers.

587
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:06,708
And your grandma Ada,
guess how old she was.

588
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:10,754
15 years old, and her father was so afraid

589
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:12,505
that these bad men would hurt her

590
00:27:12,505 --> 00:27:13,840
that, when he would hear them coming,

591
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,676
he would hide her away in the haystack,

592
00:27:16,676 --> 00:27:19,512
and she would wait there until they left.

593
00:27:19,512 --> 00:27:24,351
Grandpa was very, very terrified
that they would rape her.

594
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:27,687
And, one day, the Cossacks came galloping,

595
00:27:27,687 --> 00:27:28,938
holding these sticks of fire,

596
00:27:28,938 --> 00:27:31,066
and they set fire to all these homes

597
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:33,485
with families in them, and Ada was buried

598
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:38,365
in her haystack, suffocating,
afraid, scared to death.

599
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:40,492
She could even smell the smoke,

600
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:44,329
afraid to come out, afraid to stay put.

601
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:47,290
"What if this hay catches on fire?

602
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:49,376
"I'll burn to death."

603
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:52,587
God forbid, God forbid, God forbid.

604
00:27:52,587 --> 00:27:55,340
(exciting music)

605
00:27:56,424 --> 00:27:58,134
For a sweet year.

606
00:27:58,134 --> 00:27:59,636
(Ruthie speaking foreign language)

607
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:02,555
May God inscribe us all
in the book of life.

608
00:28:02,555 --> 00:28:05,058
God bless my beautiful children.

609
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:08,228
(Isaac speaking foreign language)

610
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:09,604
(family speaking foreign language)

611
00:28:09,604 --> 00:28:11,314
- Happy New Year.

612
00:28:11,314 --> 00:28:12,315
- Happy New Year, Christianson.

613
00:28:12,315 --> 00:28:14,567
Glad you could join us.

614
00:28:14,567 --> 00:28:16,277
- Happy New Year.

615
00:28:16,277 --> 00:28:18,113
Time to come clean.
- What?

616
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:20,156
Have you been hiding some brilliant,

617
00:28:20,156 --> 00:28:22,367
millionaire Jewish doctor?

618
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:23,660
Or a medical student?

619
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:24,953
I'll settle for a medical student.

620
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:25,829
- Well-

621
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:27,997
- Speaking of coming clean.

622
00:28:27,997 --> 00:28:31,251
I've been keeping a really
big secret from all of you,

623
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:34,254
waiting for the right time to tell you,

624
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:36,214
which I think is now, I'm pregnant.

625
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:38,591
(Ruthie cheers)

626
00:28:38,591 --> 00:28:40,802
- I don't believe it, darling,
(speaking foreign language).

627
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:42,721
You did it, Howie, you did it.

628
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:44,139
- Wait, what?

629
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:45,056
What, what?

630
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:48,101
I knew, I was kidding.

631
00:28:48,101 --> 00:28:50,520
- I didn't know.
- You silly goose.

632
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,521
- I didn't know.

633
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:53,648
I can't believe you kept
that from me, Raquel.

634
00:28:53,648 --> 00:28:55,608
- I want this baby to be
completely surrounded by love,

635
00:28:55,608 --> 00:28:57,777
so you all better be ready to play.

636
00:28:57,777 --> 00:28:59,696
- [Ruthie] Sweetheart, nothing unifies

637
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:01,698
a family more than a baby.

638
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:05,201
(Isaac speaking foreign language)

639
00:29:05,201 --> 00:29:07,954
- I mean, this is news, real news!

640
00:29:07,954 --> 00:29:11,416
News to make the
great-grandparents smile in heaven.

641
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:12,834
- I cannot wait to be an aunt.

642
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:14,627
I'm gonna be the coolest aunt.

643
00:29:14,627 --> 00:29:16,171
- How far along are you?
- Just seven weeks,

644
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:18,506
so keep it quiet, okay, 'cause it's early.

645
00:29:18,506 --> 00:29:21,217
Keep it quiet, Mom, don't go
tell the whole neighborhood.

646
00:29:21,217 --> 00:29:23,678
- [Sarabeth] Yeah,
right, Mom keep a secret?

647
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:27,015
- [Ruthie] Hey, you, mind your manners.

648
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:30,643
- Wait, I'm on the brink
of something very big.

649
00:29:30,643 --> 00:29:31,978
- I have some...

650
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:36,691
I have something to tell everyone, too.

651
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:39,986
- Oh, we've gotta go shopping.

652
00:29:39,986 --> 00:29:41,154
- Listen.

653
00:29:41,154 --> 00:29:42,947
- [Ruthie] This is the
happiest day of my life.

654
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:45,450
- I'm a lesbian, I like women!

655
00:29:48,703 --> 00:29:50,455
(Raquel laughs)

656
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:52,373
- Rebecca, there are other
ways to get our attention.

657
00:29:52,373 --> 00:29:56,085
Next time you wanna say
something, just say "excuse me."

658
00:29:56,085 --> 00:29:56,920
(Ruthie chuckles)

659
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,129
- Excuse me.

660
00:29:58,129 --> 00:30:01,299
I'm trying to tell you, I'm a lesbian.

661
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:05,720
- What?

662
00:30:07,013 --> 00:30:08,973
- Why do you always have
to steal my thunder?

663
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:10,099
- Oh, honey.

664
00:30:10,099 --> 00:30:11,392
- Really.
- Raquel.

665
00:30:11,392 --> 00:30:12,268
- Are you jealous?

666
00:30:12,268 --> 00:30:13,144
Are you jealous of your sister

667
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:15,063
because you can't find a boyfriend?

668
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:16,773
- I'm not jealous.

669
00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:18,650
Mom, I'm happy for Raquel.

670
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:21,069
I don't want a boyfriend, I'm a lesbian.

671
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:22,779
I want a girlfriend.

672
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:26,366
(sighs) It's out, I'm out.

673
00:30:27,742 --> 00:30:29,744
- Beckala, what have we ever done to you

674
00:30:29,744 --> 00:30:31,746
to deserve this kind of talk?

675
00:30:31,746 --> 00:30:35,375
- Every kid needs a flighty,
neurotic, lesbian aunt.

676
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:37,377
- Oh, Howard.
(Raquel laughs)

677
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:40,463
- Yeah, yeah, that's your crazy, lesbian

678
00:30:40,463 --> 00:30:41,965
Aunt Becky, honey.

679
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:46,386
- I didn't mean to shock you,

680
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:50,390
but I've been keeping
this a secret for so long.

681
00:30:51,766 --> 00:30:53,309
- And you suddenly think it's no longer

682
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:55,103
something to be ashamed of?

683
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:57,355
- You're saying it's better to hide?

684
00:30:57,355 --> 00:31:00,608
- Like great-grandma,
who hid in the haystack?

685
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:01,901
If she comes out, she might be hurt,

686
00:31:01,901 --> 00:31:04,112
but if she stays in, she
might be burned to death?

687
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:05,238
- [Ruthie] Don't you dare.

688
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:07,782
- Why did you have to ruin
the best day of our lives?

689
00:31:07,782 --> 00:31:08,950
How can you do this to Raquel?

690
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:10,368
We should be celebrating.

691
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:11,661
- It would be nice.

692
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:13,496
- Isaac, Isaac, please, I understand.

693
00:31:13,496 --> 00:31:15,999
Rebecca, you're our perfect child,

694
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:17,292
our beautiful, perfect child,

695
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:19,252
but you're under a lot of pressure now.

696
00:31:19,252 --> 00:31:20,169
We know that.

697
00:31:20,169 --> 00:31:22,297
I mean, here it is,
your sister is pregnant,

698
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:24,674
and you feel absolutely
terrible that it's not you,

699
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:25,508
but-
- Ma!

700
00:31:26,676 --> 00:31:27,677
- You should know that you can come

701
00:31:27,677 --> 00:31:30,763
to your father and me about anything.

702
00:31:30,763 --> 00:31:33,266
It's safe here, it's safe.

703
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:34,642
We know about Columbia Medical School.

704
00:31:34,642 --> 00:31:36,811
It's absolutely impossible.

705
00:31:36,811 --> 00:31:39,105
No, you know what, you know
what, we give you permission.

706
00:31:39,105 --> 00:31:40,732
You can get a B, once in a while.

707
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:43,401
Get a B, get a B, anytime you want.

708
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:45,278
Isaac, we put too much
pressure on this child.

709
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:46,988
- You put too much pressure-
- You have put too much

710
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:49,574
pressure on her.
- I accept them always!

711
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:51,993
- Not me!
- I accept them, I love them

712
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:53,912
for who they are.
- Gay?

713
00:31:57,999 --> 00:32:01,294
- I have the most wonderful idea.

714
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:03,755
I want you to take a
vacation over spring break.

715
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:05,214
You've never done that before.

716
00:32:05,214 --> 00:32:06,090
We'll pay for it.

717
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:07,592
You can take Sarabeth with you,

718
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:10,762
and you'll get away
from all this pressure.

719
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:13,806
Honey, you try to do too much.

720
00:32:13,806 --> 00:32:16,684
I understand, you're cracking.

721
00:32:16,684 --> 00:32:19,020
- You're cracking, I'm fine.

722
00:32:20,688 --> 00:32:22,732
I'm a lesbian, and I've
been fine with that

723
00:32:22,732 --> 00:32:24,067
for a long time.

724
00:32:26,027 --> 00:32:27,487
- It must be very, very difficult

725
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:31,074
to live up to all the nice
things I say about you.

726
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:33,701
- Rebecca, it's the high holidays.

727
00:32:33,701 --> 00:32:36,454
It's time to resolve
differences, not create them.

728
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:40,959
- This difference has been
unresolved my whole life.

729
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:44,879
Dad, if I'm not for
myself, who will be for me?

730
00:32:47,715 --> 00:32:48,549
- Hillel.

731
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:50,718
- You can get a B.

732
00:32:50,718 --> 00:32:53,554
No problem, get a B.
- Mom, why won't you listen?

733
00:32:53,554 --> 00:32:54,514
- You know what, let's go.

734
00:32:54,514 --> 00:32:56,724
- No, baby, don't go.
- Wait, wait, don't leave.

735
00:32:56,724 --> 00:32:59,018
- Please, please, don't go, my darling.

736
00:32:59,018 --> 00:32:59,894
It's (speaking foreign language).

737
00:32:59,894 --> 00:33:00,979
I made this, Sarabeth-
- You know what?

738
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:03,398
I would stay, but you
people, you make me sick.

739
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:05,149
- [Ruthie] Please, please, don't leave.

740
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:06,401
- Yeah, go, go, go, get out.

741
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:07,860
You think I want to see any of you?

742
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:08,695
Get out!

743
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:11,489
Drive carefully.

744
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:18,246
- I can't stand them.

745
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:19,956
We were raised by oppressors,

746
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:23,793
but all they can talk about
is how they were oppressed.

747
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:24,627
Fuck them.

748
00:33:24,627 --> 00:33:26,421
I am so proud of you.

749
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:30,842
- You still think I
never question anything?

750
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:32,719
- I'm a jerk.

751
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:34,804
I didn't know you like I thought I did.

752
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:37,640
- I'm a little more
interesting to you now.

753
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,600
- I'm gonna support you, okay?

754
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,728
Anything you want from
me, you let me know.

755
00:33:41,728 --> 00:33:42,562
- Really?

756
00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:46,065
Good, thanks.

757
00:33:49,986 --> 00:33:52,280
Would you do me a favor then?

758
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,364
- Anything.

759
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:57,410
- Please, go to Synagogue
with me this Yom Kippur.

760
00:33:57,410 --> 00:34:00,371
- What, after all this
bullshit, you still wanna go?

761
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:01,873
- Of course.

762
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:03,374
- You know, I have a better idea.

763
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:04,959
Let's get that trip out of Mom.

764
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:06,794
We could go to Club Med.

765
00:34:06,794 --> 00:34:08,713
I could introduce you to some women.

766
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:10,339
That would totally fucking show them.

767
00:34:10,339 --> 00:34:11,882
- Can't you understand
that I just want to be

768
00:34:11,882 --> 00:34:14,635
with family on the High Holidays?

769
00:34:14,635 --> 00:34:16,804
You're my only family now.

770
00:34:17,847 --> 00:34:19,639
- You're killing me, Becky.

771
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:23,268
You know I hate it with
every fiber of my being.

772
00:34:23,268 --> 00:34:24,896
- My synagogue in New
York is really different

773
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:26,731
than Mom and Dad's.

774
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:30,568
The rabbi is super cool
and super progressive.

775
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:33,612
Super beautiful, too.

776
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:40,536
(chanting in foreign language)

777
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,694
- "Guard our lips from evil.

778
00:35:13,694 --> 00:35:16,614
"Guard our hands from wrongdoing."

779
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:18,783
God, she's so cool!

780
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:20,201
- That's from the Amidah, Sarabeth.

781
00:35:20,201 --> 00:35:21,661
You've been hearing that
at our parents' temple

782
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:23,579
your whole life.

783
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:25,373
- I know, but Mom's rabbi never connected

784
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:27,291
it to activism.

785
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:28,209
- Why do you think they were involved

786
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:30,545
in that coat drive every year?

787
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:32,296
- Becky, why do you have to defend them

788
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:34,423
when they're being such jerks to you?

789
00:35:34,423 --> 00:35:35,925
- There she is.

790
00:35:35,925 --> 00:35:37,510
Wow, isn't she beautiful?

791
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:39,011
Let's go say hello.

792
00:35:39,011 --> 00:35:39,887
I'm nervous.

793
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:40,972
- Don't be nervous.

794
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:43,015
You look awesome.

795
00:35:43,015 --> 00:35:45,309
What kind of moves have you made so far?

796
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:47,937
- Well, I go to her services

797
00:35:47,937 --> 00:35:50,148
every Friday and Saturday morning,

798
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:54,318
and I go to her discussion
groups every Tuesday night.

799
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:55,862
- That's it?

800
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:58,906
- I always make really good points.

801
00:35:58,906 --> 00:35:59,740
- Okay.

802
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,785
Don't you think it's
time to step it up a bit.

803
00:36:02,785 --> 00:36:04,453
- Oh, no.

804
00:36:04,453 --> 00:36:06,372
See that girl standing next to her?

805
00:36:06,372 --> 00:36:07,957
That's Naomi.

806
00:36:07,957 --> 00:36:09,333
She goes to all the same stuff I do,

807
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:11,294
plus she's always dressed to kill.

808
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:14,338
She's always wearing
jewelry and full-on makeup.

809
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:15,256
She always has her hair done.

810
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:18,467
She's always wearing mini skirts.

811
00:36:18,467 --> 00:36:20,469
- I might be completely new at this,

812
00:36:20,469 --> 00:36:21,554
but that doesn't really strike me

813
00:36:21,554 --> 00:36:23,890
as a way to get a lesbian rabbi.

814
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:26,225
- Yeah, you are new at this.

815
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:29,395
- Good Yomtov, Becky Cohen.

816
00:36:29,395 --> 00:36:30,605
What are you doing?

817
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:32,273
- I have a question for the rabbi.

818
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:33,149
What are you doing?

819
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:37,236
- I have a question for the rabbi, too.

820
00:36:37,236 --> 00:36:40,156
- Good Yomtov, Becky.
- Good Yomtov, Rabbi.

821
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:42,617
- Good Yomtov, Naomi.
- Rabbi.

822
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:44,660
- Rabbi, this is my sister Sarabeth.

823
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:45,745
It's her first time here.

824
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:48,039
- Oh, it's a pleasure to meet you.

825
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:49,999
- I really enjoyed what you said.

826
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:50,833
- Good.

827
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:57,340
- We, my sister and I, we had a question.

828
00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:01,010
We were wondering if you could have

829
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:03,679
a discussion on interfaith dating.

830
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:05,765
- As a matter of fact, yes.

831
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:07,141
I have one planned for November,

832
00:37:07,141 --> 00:37:08,809
so keep your Tuesday nights free.

833
00:37:08,809 --> 00:37:11,854
- Thank you, Rabbi, thank you.

834
00:37:11,854 --> 00:37:13,105
- Yeah, thanks.

835
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,817
- Did you have a question, Naomi?

836
00:37:16,817 --> 00:37:18,361
- No, actually, I was just wondering

837
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:20,446
the same thing Becky was.

838
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:26,661
- Well then, I will see you ladies soon.

839
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:28,579
Have a meaningful fast.

840
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:35,127
- Becky, are you going to
discussion group on Tuesday?

841
00:37:35,127 --> 00:37:36,003
- Maybe.

842
00:37:36,003 --> 00:37:37,338
- Wanna get a cup of coffee after?

843
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:41,133
- Why, to discuss interfaith dating?

844
00:37:41,133 --> 00:37:43,552
- God, you are so intense.

845
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:45,012
I love that.

846
00:37:45,012 --> 00:37:48,432
No, actually, to discuss anything, Becky.

847
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:51,185
- Oh.

848
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:53,854
Oh, okay.

849
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,108
Sure, why not?

850
00:37:58,442 --> 00:38:02,071
- All right, Becky Cohen, it's a date.

851
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:03,155
I can't wait.

852
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:06,409
- What if that is a ploy to lure

853
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:09,161
me away from Rabbi Glickstein
so she can make her move.

854
00:38:09,161 --> 00:38:10,663
- Do you like her?

855
00:38:12,581 --> 00:38:14,542
- I don't know.

856
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:19,171
I mean, she's no Rabbi
Glickstein, but she is cute.

857
00:38:19,171 --> 00:38:23,009
And intelligent, really
intelligent, actually.

858
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:25,177
She called me intense,

859
00:38:25,177 --> 00:38:28,514
and I'm not sure if that's a compliment.

860
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:30,725
- Beckala.

861
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:33,644
(percussive music)

862
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:50,119
Yes, I'm getting enough sleep.

863
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:52,913
Ma, will you stop thinking
of new things to worry about?

864
00:38:52,913 --> 00:38:54,999
(Ruthie chuckles)

865
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:56,709
- And how's Becky?

866
00:38:56,709 --> 00:38:58,544
- She's happy and gay.

867
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:01,547
- That's not funny, Sarabeth.

868
00:39:01,547 --> 00:39:03,841
- Becky's going through
a very difficult time.

869
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:04,967
- True.

870
00:39:04,967 --> 00:39:07,303
Coming out to your
parents is very difficult.

871
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:11,932
- Sweetheart, why don't you
take your sister out at night?

872
00:39:11,932 --> 00:39:14,518
You know, introduce her
to some of your friends.

873
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:16,270
Be the wonderful sister that you are.

874
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:18,606
- Sure, I could do that.

875
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:20,524
I know some bull dykes.

876
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:22,401
- Is she eating?

877
00:39:22,401 --> 00:39:23,361
- You know what?

878
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:25,112
She'll be home in 10 minutes.

879
00:39:25,112 --> 00:39:26,238
Why don't you ask her yourself?

880
00:39:26,238 --> 00:39:27,239
- Is she sleeping or is she trying

881
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:28,324
to pull those all-nighters?

882
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:29,867
- [Sarabeth] Why don't
you ask her yourself?

883
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:31,577
- How late is she staying at the library?

884
00:39:31,577 --> 00:39:33,329
- Why don't you ask her yourself?

885
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:34,955
- Why don't you give me a
straight answer, damn it,

886
00:39:34,955 --> 00:39:37,291
or you'll live to regret it!

887
00:39:40,336 --> 00:39:44,423
- When she stays out
past 12, she takes a cab.

888
00:39:44,423 --> 00:39:45,383
You feel better?

889
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:46,217
- No.

890
00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:50,012
I may never feel better,
as a matter of fact.

891
00:39:50,012 --> 00:39:52,681
(sinuous music)

892
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:02,775
- [Sarabeth Voiceover] This religion is

893
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:04,944
more than 5,000 years old.

894
00:40:07,363 --> 00:40:11,409
But, frankly, it still has
a lot of growing up to do.

895
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:14,578
- [Man] Sarabeth, pay attention!

896
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:16,622
- [Sarabeth Voiceover] And my mother,

897
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:19,041
she's not so young, either.

898
00:40:19,041 --> 00:40:20,626
When is she gonna wake up?

899
00:40:20,626 --> 00:40:23,295
(sinuous music)

900
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:27,299
One minute, she says she's suffering,

901
00:40:27,299 --> 00:40:28,551
the next minute, she wants her daughters

902
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:30,219
to be just like her.

903
00:40:31,178 --> 00:40:33,097
Great, where do I sign?

904
00:40:35,307 --> 00:40:39,687
Nobody notices the great
mothers and wives of the Torah.

905
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:41,730
What is the point of being chosen

906
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:44,400
when you don't have any choices?

907
00:40:48,737 --> 00:40:49,989
- [Simon] Stop.

908
00:40:52,491 --> 00:40:53,534
- Why won't you look at me?

909
00:40:53,534 --> 00:40:56,078
- [Simon] Well, maybe I
feel a little bit rejected.

910
00:40:56,078 --> 00:40:58,497
- Sometimes, I have
other things on my mind.

911
00:40:58,497 --> 00:40:59,498
- Sometimes?

912
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:02,460
- Yeah, sometimes.

913
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:05,546
- You know, we only get to see each other

914
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:08,090
like every other weekend,
so, if we don't have sex now,

915
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:10,885
then we go like another
whole two weeks without it.

916
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:13,721
- Is that why you come here?

917
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:15,222
- No!

918
00:41:15,222 --> 00:41:18,809
- Then stop treating
me like a blowup doll.

919
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:25,900
- Oh, back again, are we?

920
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:30,404
- I took your advice
to be less optimistic.

921
00:41:35,367 --> 00:41:36,869
- Yes, I see that.

922
00:41:38,287 --> 00:41:42,416
You should also try to
be a bit less literal.

923
00:41:42,416 --> 00:41:45,085
(sinuous music)

924
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:32,299
(light music)

925
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:38,138
(traffic hums)

926
00:42:41,016 --> 00:42:43,519
(light music)

927
00:43:07,042 --> 00:43:09,962
- I need to remember to relax more.

928
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:11,964
Like this.

929
00:43:13,966 --> 00:43:16,552
- Baby you don't feel relaxed.

930
00:43:16,552 --> 00:43:17,636
What's wrong?

931
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:22,099
- I wanna see you more.

932
00:43:23,058 --> 00:43:25,561
I wanna see my friends more.

933
00:43:25,561 --> 00:43:26,812
I wanna watch more great movies,

934
00:43:26,812 --> 00:43:30,733
and, somehow, I always wanna paint more.

935
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:31,859
- And you wanna work out more

936
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:34,111
and sleep more and read more.

937
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:36,196
Is there anything you wanna do less?

938
00:43:36,196 --> 00:43:37,865
- Yeah, wait tables.

939
00:43:39,199 --> 00:43:41,952
(Simon chuckles)

940
00:43:45,706 --> 00:43:48,792
- I think you should move in with me.

941
00:43:50,961 --> 00:43:51,795
- Here?

942
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:55,090
- Yeah, here.

943
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:56,008
I mean, I make enough money now

944
00:43:56,008 --> 00:43:57,968
that you would only
have to work part-time.

945
00:43:57,968 --> 00:44:01,305
You can use the loft room
as your painting room.

946
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:02,389
I mean, as of now, you only get

947
00:44:02,389 --> 00:44:03,349
like every other weekend off.

948
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:05,851
We never get to see each other.

949
00:44:05,851 --> 00:44:09,271
And we're ready, Sarabeth, we're in love.

950
00:44:14,443 --> 00:44:17,363
(percussive music)

951
00:44:59,071 --> 00:45:00,197
- [Sarabeth Voiceover]
Hi, professor Willow,

952
00:45:00,197 --> 00:45:02,157
this is Sarabeth Cohen.

953
00:45:02,157 --> 00:45:03,909
I'm living in New York now,

954
00:45:03,909 --> 00:45:05,994
doing the whole bringing my slides

955
00:45:05,994 --> 00:45:08,122
to the galleries thing.

956
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:10,416
Anyways, I was just wondering,

957
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:11,875
you said we should call you

958
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:14,420
when we're ready to go professional

959
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:17,047
because you have a lot of contacts.

960
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:20,718
I would love to talk to
you any time about that.

961
00:45:20,718 --> 00:45:24,471
I'm living here now, and loving it.

962
00:45:24,471 --> 00:45:26,890
I guess I'll try you again later.

963
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:28,392
Thanks.

964
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:30,811
(lush music)

965
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:49,163
- [Women] Surprise!

966
00:45:50,122 --> 00:45:52,458
- Oh my gosh, I had no idea!

967
00:45:53,375 --> 00:45:58,088
I thought Mom and I were just
gonna carve pumpkins today.

968
00:45:58,088 --> 00:45:59,882
- We've got bigger plans, come on.

969
00:45:59,882 --> 00:46:01,467
Sit on your throne.

970
00:46:02,384 --> 00:46:05,012
- Oh my gosh, you guys.

971
00:46:05,012 --> 00:46:06,555
- Okay, I'm gonna write down the gifts.

972
00:46:06,555 --> 00:46:07,681
Monica can make the hat,

973
00:46:07,681 --> 00:46:09,725
and Marie can give her the presents.

974
00:46:09,725 --> 00:46:10,768
- I always make the hat.

975
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:13,103
- Oh my gosh, I can't believe
all these presents are for me.

976
00:46:13,103 --> 00:46:14,772
- Oh, you deserve it, honey.

977
00:46:14,772 --> 00:46:16,273
- Thank you, guys.

978
00:46:17,816 --> 00:46:18,984
Wonderful.

979
00:46:18,984 --> 00:46:20,861
- Yeah, that's the fastest
blender on the market.

980
00:46:20,861 --> 00:46:21,695
- Really?

981
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:24,072
- People underestimate the
importance of a blender.

982
00:46:24,072 --> 00:46:26,033
- You can get the dinner
on the table in minutes.

983
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:28,577
- Thanks to you guys. (chuckles)

984
00:46:28,577 --> 00:46:31,705
- It's so pretty, I
hate to ruin the paper.

985
00:46:31,705 --> 00:46:33,040
Oh my gosh, Mom!

986
00:46:34,374 --> 00:46:35,793
- Now I don't have to worry about you two

987
00:46:35,793 --> 00:46:38,003
going through life with unprocessed food!

988
00:46:38,003 --> 00:46:40,255
(women laugh)

989
00:46:40,255 --> 00:46:41,590
- I registered for two of those.

990
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:42,549
- Really?

991
00:46:42,549 --> 00:46:44,676
Oh, this is adorable.

992
00:46:44,676 --> 00:46:46,428
Great, look at these.

993
00:46:47,679 --> 00:46:48,931
Terrific.

994
00:46:48,931 --> 00:46:52,059
- Yep, you can never have too
many wooden spoons, right?

995
00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:53,477
(women chuckle)

996
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:54,520
Did I just say that?

997
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:55,938
(women chuckle)

998
00:46:55,938 --> 00:46:58,774
- I use a wooden spoon every single day.

999
00:46:58,774 --> 00:47:00,108
- [Stacey] They come in handy, don't they?

1000
00:47:00,108 --> 00:47:01,276
- This wasn't on the registry.

1001
00:47:01,276 --> 00:47:02,611
- Oh, let's see.

1002
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:12,079
Oh my gosh, this one's from Sarabeth.

1003
00:47:15,457 --> 00:47:17,167
Let's see what it is.

1004
00:47:19,962 --> 00:47:23,882
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh,
oh my gosh, oh my gosh!

1005
00:47:28,262 --> 00:47:30,222
You remembered!

1006
00:47:30,222 --> 00:47:32,641
This is my dream house.

1007
00:47:32,641 --> 00:47:34,226
- Oh!
- It's exactly like

1008
00:47:34,226 --> 00:47:36,353
I described it to you.

1009
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:37,604
It's beautiful.

1010
00:47:39,022 --> 00:47:40,148
- Thanks.

1011
00:47:40,148 --> 00:47:43,819
- This is the greatest present
anyone could ever give me.

1012
00:47:43,819 --> 00:47:45,737
Tony and I are gonna put
it on the mantelpiece

1013
00:47:45,737 --> 00:47:47,781
and look at it every time we forget

1014
00:47:47,781 --> 00:47:50,784
what we're working so hard for.

1015
00:47:50,784 --> 00:47:54,872
I dream about having children
in a place like this.

1016
00:47:54,872 --> 00:47:57,207
Sarabeth, I love it!

1017
00:47:57,207 --> 00:47:58,792
Come here, I wanna give you a hug!

1018
00:47:58,792 --> 00:48:01,044
Come on, come here!

1019
00:48:01,044 --> 00:48:02,921
Get over here!

1020
00:48:02,921 --> 00:48:05,340
(women clap)

1021
00:48:07,175 --> 00:48:10,679
- And now it's time to
put Stacey's crazy hat on.

1022
00:48:10,679 --> 00:48:14,600
- Oh, no, you don't actually
expect me to wear that thing!

1023
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:15,434
- Oh yeah!

1024
00:48:16,518 --> 00:48:17,394
- Okay.

1025
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:19,897
(women laugh)

1026
00:48:20,814 --> 00:48:21,940
You don't know how you're gonna feel

1027
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:24,359
until you're actually
wearing one of these things.

1028
00:48:24,359 --> 00:48:26,862
(women laugh)

1029
00:48:32,034 --> 00:48:33,535
- Don't freak out.

1030
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:37,331
You know how important this is to me.

1031
00:48:37,331 --> 00:48:40,000
Remember, he's making an effort.

1032
00:48:41,376 --> 00:48:42,336
- You don't even ask who it is?

1033
00:48:42,336 --> 00:48:43,128
- Hi.
- Gonna let Jack the Ripper

1034
00:48:43,128 --> 00:48:45,505
in one of these days.
- Hi.

1035
00:48:45,505 --> 00:48:48,091
- Oh, it feels so good to be social.

1036
00:48:48,091 --> 00:48:48,926
You know, this is the like the first time

1037
00:48:48,926 --> 00:48:51,553
in a week I haven't thrown up.

1038
00:48:51,553 --> 00:48:54,264
- Special delivery form your mother.

1039
00:48:54,264 --> 00:48:55,933
- Well, where is she?

1040
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:57,434
- Here, in spirit.

1041
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:01,855
This place is filled with canvases,

1042
00:49:01,855 --> 00:49:03,857
my little Leonardo da Vinci.

1043
00:49:03,857 --> 00:49:05,859
I was wrong, I admit it.

1044
00:49:05,859 --> 00:49:08,362
The waitressing agrees with you.

1045
00:49:08,362 --> 00:49:12,157
- Well, you weren't completely wrong.

1046
00:49:12,157 --> 00:49:13,325
I do hate it.

1047
00:49:13,325 --> 00:49:16,870
- Better hate your job
at your age than mine.

1048
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:18,455
How is school, Doc?

1049
00:49:19,498 --> 00:49:23,585
- Well, I'm finally getting
used to looking at cadavers.

1050
00:49:23,585 --> 00:49:27,798
- Rabbi Mendelson asks
about you all the time.

1051
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:29,341
He remembers how smart you are,

1052
00:49:29,341 --> 00:49:31,802
fighting with him, a lot,

1053
00:49:31,802 --> 00:49:34,596
making him think more than anybody else.

1054
00:49:34,596 --> 00:49:37,182
Valedictorian of your Hebrew School.

1055
00:49:37,182 --> 00:49:38,934
You should go pay him a visit.

1056
00:49:38,934 --> 00:49:39,768
- Sure.

1057
00:49:40,769 --> 00:49:43,313
- Raquel made some cookies.

1058
00:49:43,313 --> 00:49:44,690
Good practice for motherhood.

1059
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:45,649
- I don't wanna eat them all by myself.

1060
00:49:45,649 --> 00:49:47,693
I'm getting fat enough as it is.

1061
00:49:47,693 --> 00:49:50,737
So come on, here, they're still warm.

1062
00:49:50,737 --> 00:49:52,197
- Tell them about Howie.

1063
00:49:52,197 --> 00:49:55,575
Things are finally looking
up, and just in time.

1064
00:49:55,575 --> 00:49:57,160
- I don't wanna say
anything too prematurely,

1065
00:49:57,160 --> 00:50:00,706
but looks like he and Steve
have sold all the properties

1066
00:50:00,706 --> 00:50:02,416
they invested in.

1067
00:50:02,416 --> 00:50:03,458
Isn't that great?

1068
00:50:03,458 --> 00:50:05,210
He's so happy, he's been singing Van Halen

1069
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:07,796
songs in the shower. (laughs)

1070
00:50:07,796 --> 00:50:08,922
- Van Halen?

1071
00:50:08,922 --> 00:50:11,508
- It's what we liked to listen
to in high school, thank you.

1072
00:50:11,508 --> 00:50:12,384
- Okay.

1073
00:50:12,384 --> 00:50:14,511
- That's wonderful, Raquel.

1074
00:50:14,511 --> 00:50:16,972
- You know, I'm always rooting for Howie,

1075
00:50:16,972 --> 00:50:21,685
waiting for him to sort of
prove himself to the world.

1076
00:50:21,685 --> 00:50:23,061
He's gonna be a great dad.

1077
00:50:23,061 --> 00:50:24,688
- And, if he makes enough money,

1078
00:50:24,688 --> 00:50:28,233
Raquel may even be able to
stay at home with the baby.

1079
00:50:28,233 --> 00:50:29,484
- That's great.

1080
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:32,863
- Oh, great, great life.

1081
00:50:34,281 --> 00:50:35,198
- Sarabeth.

1082
00:50:36,616 --> 00:50:40,162
- (sighs) You love to teach.

1083
00:50:40,162 --> 00:50:42,205
- And I will love to spend
time with my baby even more.

1084
00:50:42,205 --> 00:50:43,040
Why do you always have to make

1085
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,751
everything the Russian Revolution?

1086
00:50:45,751 --> 00:50:48,420
- No, it's just, you know,
I wish I was a lesbian

1087
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:51,089
so I didn't have to buy
into all the expectations.

1088
00:50:51,089 --> 00:50:54,760
- Baby, when did you
get to be so nasty, huh?

1089
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:57,304
When was your life ever so hard?

1090
00:50:57,304 --> 00:50:58,930
God, you used to be
like the sweetest child

1091
00:50:58,930 --> 00:51:00,015
anybody ever knew.

1092
00:51:00,015 --> 00:51:01,183
What happened?

1093
00:51:06,188 --> 00:51:09,858
- I'm sorry, Raquel,
I'm happy for you guys.

1094
00:51:13,987 --> 00:51:17,365
And, Daddy, I think it's
great that you came here.

1095
00:51:17,365 --> 00:51:20,202
- I'm glad I came here, too, baby.

1096
00:51:23,663 --> 00:51:26,666
Becky, you were always so religious.

1097
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:32,756
- I live a modern spiritual Jewish life.

1098
00:51:34,966 --> 00:51:39,930
- That means you pick and
choose which laws to break?

1099
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:42,432
Remember what Tevye says
in "Fiddler on the Roof."

1100
00:51:42,432 --> 00:51:44,768
"What happens to a beautiful fabric

1101
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:47,687
"when you pull out even a tiny thread?"

1102
00:51:47,687 --> 00:51:50,440
- A fabric can bend to fit the person

1103
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:52,651
who chooses to wear it.

1104
00:51:52,651 --> 00:51:56,363
- But Tevye also says,
"If you bend me too much,

1105
00:51:56,363 --> 00:51:57,614
"I will break."

1106
00:51:58,907 --> 00:52:02,077
- You don't follow every rule, either.

1107
00:52:06,123 --> 00:52:08,166
- All right, you're right.

1108
00:52:08,166 --> 00:52:11,128
Well, in the words of
Hannibal the Cannibal,

1109
00:52:11,128 --> 00:52:15,006
"Let's forget what's
eating us, and let's eat."

1110
00:52:16,758 --> 00:52:18,468
- That's lovely, Dad.

1111
00:52:18,468 --> 00:52:19,678
Yum.

1112
00:52:19,678 --> 00:52:20,512
- What do you mean?

1113
00:52:20,512 --> 00:52:23,181
(Becky laughs)

1114
00:52:23,181 --> 00:52:25,600
(soft music)

1115
00:52:39,364 --> 00:52:40,282
- [Sarabeth Voiceover] Growing up

1116
00:52:40,282 --> 00:52:42,826
doesn't have to mean giving up.

1117
00:52:44,578 --> 00:52:46,037
All the waiters I work with have been

1118
00:52:46,037 --> 00:52:50,041
pursuing their art careers
for five to 10 years.

1119
00:52:51,751 --> 00:52:53,170
- Just leave your postcards here, sweetie.

1120
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:54,337
We'll get back to you.

1121
00:52:54,337 --> 00:52:55,589
- You will hear from us just as soon

1122
00:52:55,589 --> 00:52:59,509
as the curators have a
chance to see your work.

1123
00:53:03,054 --> 00:53:04,389
- [Sarabeth Voiceover] I'm
not sure if anybody gets

1124
00:53:04,389 --> 00:53:06,683
Gina's music or cares that Charlotte

1125
00:53:06,683 --> 00:53:11,354
can do a split in the air,
but we all keep trying,

1126
00:53:11,354 --> 00:53:14,024
no matter what anybody tells us.

1127
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:15,734
You ever hear the sound

1128
00:53:15,734 --> 00:53:18,111
of eight million people not clapping?

1129
00:53:18,111 --> 00:53:21,489
(percussive music)

1130
00:53:21,489 --> 00:53:24,993
- The world's just not
ready for you, kiddo.

1131
00:53:24,993 --> 00:53:27,996
- Maybe I'm not ready for the world.

1132
00:53:29,497 --> 00:53:31,708
- Don't sweat the small stuff.

1133
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:33,543
- Don't call it small.

1134
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:39,674
You know, I remember when
you wanted it badly, too.

1135
00:53:56,233 --> 00:53:58,777
(traffic hums)

1136
00:54:02,405 --> 00:54:07,410
(pulsing music)
(wind whistles)

1137
00:54:27,722 --> 00:54:32,185
- [Simon] So, what are
you going to wish for?

1138
00:54:32,185 --> 00:54:33,436
- I'm not sure.

1139
00:54:36,106 --> 00:54:40,694
- Well, maybe that's because
you have everything you need.

1140
00:54:40,694 --> 00:54:41,945
- I don't know.

1141
00:54:42,821 --> 00:54:44,155
Sometimes, I think me and the real me

1142
00:54:44,155 --> 00:54:46,908
have been out of touch for years,

1143
00:54:49,369 --> 00:54:52,497
and neither seems to wanna call first.

1144
00:54:53,456 --> 00:54:56,543
- Maybe you should make the first move.

1145
00:54:56,543 --> 00:55:01,047
- I should make a wish that
I can make happen myself,

1146
00:55:01,047 --> 00:55:04,134
stop relying on these stupid candles.

1147
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:18,857
- [Boss] All right, honey, I
got two minutes, what is it?

1148
00:55:18,857 --> 00:55:21,192
- I know you're really busy.

1149
00:55:23,194 --> 00:55:24,779
You know how this place
is never really booked

1150
00:55:24,779 --> 00:55:26,948
on Monday nights?
- Mm hmm.

1151
00:55:28,283 --> 00:55:31,870
- I was wondering if maybe I could have

1152
00:55:31,870 --> 00:55:34,289
a showing of my artwork here.

1153
00:55:36,249 --> 00:55:37,792
- You know, you're like the worst waitress

1154
00:55:37,792 --> 00:55:39,294
that we have here.

1155
00:55:42,464 --> 00:55:44,549
- No, I didn't know that.

1156
00:55:45,967 --> 00:55:47,260
- Yeah, I'm always on
the verge of firing you

1157
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:49,262
but, you know, I just can't
bring myself to do it.

1158
00:55:49,262 --> 00:55:51,598
- How about I give you $500?

1159
00:55:57,729 --> 00:56:00,440
- And you give me five Saturday nights

1160
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:03,151
in addition to your regular shifts.

1161
00:56:03,151 --> 00:56:05,195
Call that a deal.

1162
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:07,322
- Deal, thank you.

1163
00:56:07,322 --> 00:56:08,239
- [Boss] Well all right.

1164
00:56:08,239 --> 00:56:10,658
(busy music)

1165
00:56:20,251 --> 00:56:21,419
- Matisse said,

1166
00:56:21,419 --> 00:56:23,505
creativity takes courage.

1167
00:56:26,257 --> 00:56:30,678
Here's my heart, soul, and
belief system on a canvas.

1168
00:56:32,597 --> 00:56:33,890
Go ahead and judge me.

1169
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:36,309
(busy music)

1170
00:56:57,414 --> 00:56:59,999
(TV chatters)

1171
00:56:59,999 --> 00:57:01,668
Aren't you happy to see me?

1172
00:57:01,668 --> 00:57:03,545
- I'm just tired.

1173
00:57:03,545 --> 00:57:04,963
After work, I had to
make the half-hour trip

1174
00:57:04,963 --> 00:57:07,549
to the train station to pick you up.

1175
00:57:07,549 --> 00:57:09,634
- Oh, yeah, that's tough.

1176
00:57:11,970 --> 00:57:14,806
Oh, I just spent three
hours with motion sickness

1177
00:57:14,806 --> 00:57:17,976
on that broken-down
local train to nowhere,

1178
00:57:17,976 --> 00:57:22,772
and then 10 minutes freezing
my ass off, waiting for you.

1179
00:57:22,772 --> 00:57:25,275
(TV chatters)

1180
00:57:26,651 --> 00:57:27,861
- I'm sorry.

1181
00:57:27,861 --> 00:57:30,363
(TV chatters)

1182
00:57:33,825 --> 00:57:36,661
- So, Tom said yes about the show.

1183
00:57:40,498 --> 00:57:41,583
February 4th.

1184
00:57:43,126 --> 00:57:44,669
- So what exactly does that mean?

1185
00:57:44,669 --> 00:57:46,671
- Well, we'll invite everyone I know,

1186
00:57:46,671 --> 00:57:48,798
plus everyone you know.

1187
00:57:48,798 --> 00:57:52,469
We can invite art press,
some professors from school.

1188
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:53,344
We can invite-

1189
00:57:53,344 --> 00:57:56,139
- The ones who aren't calling you back?

1190
00:57:56,139 --> 00:57:59,350
- Well, this will just give
me a reason to call me back.

1191
00:57:59,350 --> 00:58:01,895
He's only charging me $500.

1192
00:58:01,895 --> 00:58:02,896
- Only $500.

1193
00:58:03,938 --> 00:58:06,566
And you have to pay for
your own food, right?

1194
00:58:06,566 --> 00:58:09,319
How the hell are you gonna pull this off?

1195
00:58:09,319 --> 00:58:10,820
- Hey, I'm still young.

1196
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:11,863
I can max out my credit cards

1197
00:58:11,863 --> 00:58:14,866
without ruining my entire life.

1198
00:58:14,866 --> 00:58:17,452
(train clacks)

1199
00:58:18,578 --> 00:58:21,164
(gentle music)

1200
00:58:30,798 --> 00:58:32,717
- [Becky] What's wrong?

1201
00:58:34,427 --> 00:58:37,222
- (sighs) I just realized I'm too old

1202
00:58:37,222 --> 00:58:40,183
to become a child prodigy.

1203
00:58:40,183 --> 00:58:43,853
- Well, you've got a lot of
years to become a Grandma Moses.

1204
00:58:43,853 --> 00:58:44,687
- Swell.

1205
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:53,571
- Why do I think everyone
should listen to me?

1206
00:58:53,571 --> 00:58:55,406
- When you answer that,

1207
00:58:55,406 --> 00:58:58,034
then you'll create something wonderful.

1208
00:58:58,034 --> 00:59:03,039
- (chuckles) Why do you always
sound like a fortune cookie?

1209
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:08,795
- Ow.
(Sarabeth chuckles)

1210
00:59:08,795 --> 00:59:11,339
- I remember my first cynical thought.

1211
00:59:11,339 --> 00:59:12,340
I was eight.

1212
00:59:13,216 --> 00:59:16,261
My dad told me even though
Moses busted his ass

1213
00:59:16,261 --> 00:59:18,846
and brought the Jews out of Egypt,

1214
00:59:18,846 --> 00:59:22,016
he never made it to the Promised Land.

1215
00:59:23,851 --> 00:59:26,062
Excuse me, but what
part of "promised land"

1216
00:59:26,062 --> 00:59:27,897
didn't God understand?

1217
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:34,404
Seems like when you stand
up for your beliefs,

1218
00:59:34,404 --> 00:59:35,655
you're usually alone.

1219
00:59:35,655 --> 00:59:38,074
(busy music)

1220
00:59:42,203 --> 00:59:43,580
Where do you wanna go to eat?

1221
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:46,541
- Do you need this for your show?

1222
00:59:46,541 --> 00:59:49,877
- No, I think I'm just gonna use a photo.

1223
00:59:49,877 --> 00:59:51,754
I can't believe you
took this off your wall.

1224
00:59:51,754 --> 00:59:53,047
- [Simon] I'm sorry.

1225
00:59:53,047 --> 00:59:56,217
- It's okay, you were just being nice.

1226
01:00:00,138 --> 01:00:02,557
- No, baby, I mean I'm sorry.

1227
01:00:03,766 --> 01:00:04,851
- About what?

1228
01:00:07,145 --> 01:00:11,065
- I'm sorry that I can't
do this anymore, that-

1229
01:00:12,442 --> 01:00:14,861
- You're bringing up with me?

1230
01:00:15,945 --> 01:00:18,323
Why are you doing this?

1231
01:00:18,323 --> 01:00:19,532
Because of the show?

1232
01:00:19,532 --> 01:00:20,950
Are you worried you're gonna get ignored

1233
01:00:20,950 --> 01:00:22,827
because of the show?
- No, I've just done

1234
01:00:22,827 --> 01:00:25,872
some thinking, and I realize
I can't do this anymore.

1235
01:00:25,872 --> 01:00:26,998
- Because I won't move in with you?

1236
01:00:26,998 --> 01:00:28,374
Because I can move in
with you after the show-

1237
01:00:28,374 --> 01:00:33,254
- Sarabeth, you know that's
what I've wanted for months.

1238
01:00:33,254 --> 01:00:35,298
Your career is just taking off,

1239
01:00:35,298 --> 01:00:38,468
and there's no room in it for me.

1240
01:00:38,468 --> 01:00:42,055
You might not be able to
see that now, but I can.

1241
01:00:42,055 --> 01:00:44,515
I want you to know that I love you,

1242
01:00:44,515 --> 01:00:47,852
and I believe in you, and I always will.

1243
01:00:49,437 --> 01:00:50,855
- But not enough.

1244
01:00:52,774 --> 01:00:55,860
- I couldn't love you any more.

1245
01:00:55,860 --> 01:00:57,945
Can't you see that you've
been my whole world?

1246
01:00:57,945 --> 01:01:00,406
I could never be your whole world.

1247
01:01:00,406 --> 01:01:02,283
The one thing that I want
in my life is simplicity,

1248
01:01:02,283 --> 01:01:05,953
and it's the one thing too
difficult for you to give to me.

1249
01:01:05,953 --> 01:01:09,040
- You're scared, you're scared
to have a different life

1250
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:11,417
than our fucking parents and your sister!

1251
01:01:11,417 --> 01:01:13,252
- Sarabeth, I'm sorry.

1252
01:01:15,546 --> 01:01:17,757
- I have like 10,000
letters where you promise

1253
01:01:17,757 --> 01:01:22,345
you would never leave me,
and I promised you, too,

1254
01:01:22,345 --> 01:01:23,429
but I meant it.

1255
01:01:23,429 --> 01:01:26,432
- That's because you're
relentless, not because it's right.

1256
01:01:26,432 --> 01:01:29,519
- Shut the fuck up, shut the fuck up.

1257
01:01:34,107 --> 01:01:35,108
- I'm sorry.

1258
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:38,945
I'm so sorry.

1259
01:01:45,743 --> 01:01:49,497
- You don't even wanna keep the rocket?

1260
01:01:49,497 --> 01:01:50,665
- You keep it.

1261
01:01:53,251 --> 01:01:54,877
I gotta go.

1262
01:01:54,877 --> 01:01:58,506
You have to work tonight, like
you do every Saturday night.

1263
01:01:58,506 --> 01:01:59,424
I gotta go.

1264
01:02:03,261 --> 01:02:04,345
- I love you.

1265
01:02:11,310 --> 01:02:14,063
(Sarabeth weeps)

1266
01:02:33,374 --> 01:02:36,377
(people chattering)

1267
01:02:56,898 --> 01:02:59,650
(Sarabeth sighs)

1268
01:03:02,195 --> 01:03:04,697
- Come on, sweetheart, latkes!

1269
01:03:06,991 --> 01:03:09,035
These were your favorite
when you were a kid.

1270
01:03:09,035 --> 01:03:11,913
- Mom, it's getting late,
can we light the candles?

1271
01:03:11,913 --> 01:03:13,414
- Remember when Sarabeth was seven,

1272
01:03:13,414 --> 01:03:14,791
and she made those Hanukkah ornaments

1273
01:03:14,791 --> 01:03:19,796
to go on the school
Christmas tree? (laughs)

1274
01:03:19,879 --> 01:03:21,631
You can't stop laughing, Sarabeth.

1275
01:03:21,631 --> 01:03:23,758
You know what they say
about Jews and comedy.

1276
01:03:23,758 --> 01:03:24,634
It's in our blood.

1277
01:03:24,634 --> 01:03:28,930
Like Mel Brooks says,
"Make the big Aryan laugh

1278
01:03:28,930 --> 01:03:32,350
"and maybe he won't hit you
on the head with a big stick."

1279
01:03:32,350 --> 01:03:34,018
- Listen, when they come in, please,

1280
01:03:34,018 --> 01:03:35,686
pretend that you don't know anything.

1281
01:03:35,686 --> 01:03:37,772
Happy Hanukkah!

1282
01:03:37,772 --> 01:03:39,482
Is this for me?

1283
01:03:39,482 --> 01:03:40,566
- Happy Hanukkah.

1284
01:03:40,566 --> 01:03:41,484
(Isaac speaking foreign language)

1285
01:03:41,484 --> 01:03:43,986
- Howard, one, two, excellent.

1286
01:03:45,613 --> 01:03:47,824
I didn't tell them anything.

1287
01:03:47,824 --> 01:03:51,410
- Well, it's okay, we'll
give them a chance to hear it

1288
01:03:51,410 --> 01:03:53,996
right out of the horse's mouth.

1289
01:03:55,331 --> 01:03:56,999
Finally sold all the properties.

1290
01:03:56,999 --> 01:03:59,252
- He made a really good profit.

1291
01:03:59,252 --> 01:04:01,796
- (sighs) Then my brother took off,

1292
01:04:01,796 --> 01:04:05,049
and took off with everything.

1293
01:04:05,049 --> 01:04:06,801
He's a mess.

1294
01:04:06,801 --> 01:04:08,970
I've been trying to help
him change his life.

1295
01:04:08,970 --> 01:04:11,264
- We put everything into that business,

1296
01:04:11,264 --> 01:04:12,974
more than you know.

1297
01:04:12,974 --> 01:04:16,227
- So, we're going to move in here.

1298
01:04:16,227 --> 01:04:17,061
- Yeah.

1299
01:04:18,020 --> 01:04:20,189
- Temporarily, thankfully.

1300
01:04:21,274 --> 01:04:22,608
- It's wonderful, really.

1301
01:04:22,608 --> 01:04:25,152
We can spend time with our new grandchild,

1302
01:04:25,152 --> 01:04:27,530
get to visit with you, it's perfect.

1303
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:29,031
Everybody's happy.

1304
01:04:29,031 --> 01:04:32,535
- Howie, that business,
it meant so much to you.

1305
01:04:32,535 --> 01:04:34,912
- Sometimes what's important changes.

1306
01:04:34,912 --> 01:04:37,331
- Listen, what's really
important, darling,

1307
01:04:37,331 --> 01:04:39,750
is your health, your happiness,

1308
01:04:39,750 --> 01:04:42,587
and the fact that this baby, whoa,

1309
01:04:43,629 --> 01:04:48,384
is on the way, so eat (speaking
foreign language), eat.

1310
01:04:48,384 --> 01:04:50,219
They're good, they're fresh, they're hot.

1311
01:04:50,219 --> 01:04:53,806
Becky, maybe you can
babysit for them, huh?

1312
01:04:54,724 --> 01:04:57,393
I mean, if you decide to
take next semester off.

1313
01:04:57,393 --> 01:04:59,270
- I'm not taking time off.

1314
01:04:59,270 --> 01:05:00,897
- I think it would do you good.

1315
01:05:00,897 --> 01:05:03,399
- Oh, that's right, I'm
gay because I'm overworked.

1316
01:05:03,399 --> 01:05:05,026
- Ooh, I don't wanna hear this.

1317
01:05:05,026 --> 01:05:06,068
- I know, that's why you only call

1318
01:05:06,068 --> 01:05:09,989
to talk to Sarabeth when
you know I'm not home.

1319
01:05:09,989 --> 01:05:11,991
- Do you know what my
mother would've done?

1320
01:05:11,991 --> 01:05:12,825
- What?

1321
01:05:12,825 --> 01:05:14,702
- My mother would've said Kaddish for you.

1322
01:05:14,702 --> 01:05:15,995
- Oh, that's wonderful.

1323
01:05:15,995 --> 01:05:17,496
- Do you know why?

1324
01:05:18,623 --> 01:05:19,790
- No, why?

1325
01:05:19,790 --> 01:05:21,292
- Because unlike you or me, she lived

1326
01:05:21,292 --> 01:05:23,127
according to the Torah,
and not just sometimes,

1327
01:05:23,127 --> 01:05:26,130
but every day, every minute of every day.

1328
01:05:26,130 --> 01:05:27,798
Now, I don't claim to be
the saint that she was,

1329
01:05:27,798 --> 01:05:31,052
but these traditions, they
enable us to survive, Becky.

1330
01:05:31,052 --> 01:05:33,095
I know, I know.

1331
01:05:33,095 --> 01:05:35,848
Something is lost in every generation,

1332
01:05:35,848 --> 01:05:37,391
but to what degree?

1333
01:05:38,684 --> 01:05:43,064
I never planned to condone
this kind of behavior.

1334
01:05:43,064 --> 01:05:45,024
- There's a Yiddish folk saying,

1335
01:05:45,024 --> 01:05:50,029
if you wanna give God a good
laugh, tell him your plans.

1336
01:05:50,237 --> 01:05:51,197
- [Ruthie] Very funny.

1337
01:05:51,197 --> 01:05:54,075
- In the words of Spinoza,
the secret to life

1338
01:05:54,075 --> 01:05:55,493
is that it stops.

1339
01:05:56,577 --> 01:05:59,956
- That's Kafka, Daddy, that's Kafka.

1340
01:05:59,956 --> 01:06:03,709
- Okay, the truth is
your father's very sick.

1341
01:06:03,709 --> 01:06:07,713
- Not very sick, Ruthie, a little sick.

1342
01:06:07,713 --> 01:06:09,131
- [Ruthie] You know that he
has trouble breathing, right?

1343
01:06:09,131 --> 01:06:11,509
Well, it's not because of
all your antics or my antics.

1344
01:06:11,509 --> 01:06:12,593
- Well, what is it then?

1345
01:06:12,593 --> 01:06:14,220
- An infection in the lungs.

1346
01:06:14,220 --> 01:06:15,972
- Are you surprised, after 35 years

1347
01:06:15,972 --> 01:06:18,808
of having to work at that printing press?

1348
01:06:18,808 --> 01:06:20,893
- I'm lucky that I breathe any air.

1349
01:06:20,893 --> 01:06:22,103
(Isaac speaking foreign language)

1350
01:06:22,103 --> 01:06:23,270
- But you're gonna be okay, right?

1351
01:06:23,270 --> 01:06:24,897
The doctors, they can help you, right?

1352
01:06:24,897 --> 01:06:26,857
- [Isaac] Of course, baby, of course.

1353
01:06:26,857 --> 01:06:28,734
- Daddy has to go for some
more tests with the doctors,

1354
01:06:28,734 --> 01:06:31,779
but you know Daddy, he is a strong man.

1355
01:06:31,779 --> 01:06:34,699
- I'm much stronger when I
have my whole family around me.

1356
01:06:34,699 --> 01:06:36,993
- Well, yeah, you're gonna
be here for the baby, right?

1357
01:06:36,993 --> 01:06:41,080
- My plan is to be around
for all your babies.

1358
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:44,750
But what did I just say
about God and plans?

1359
01:06:51,757 --> 01:06:54,719
The light's going down,
let's light the candles

1360
01:06:54,719 --> 01:06:56,971
and remember this as a joyous occasion.

1361
01:06:56,971 --> 01:06:59,890
We have enough misery in our history.

1362
01:06:59,890 --> 01:07:02,309
On Hanukkah, we remember great miracles.

1363
01:07:02,309 --> 01:07:05,062
(graceful music)

1364
01:07:13,070 --> 01:07:17,324
(Isaac chants in foreign language)

1365
01:07:21,078 --> 01:07:25,249
(Isaac and Ruthie chant
in foreign language)

1366
01:07:25,249 --> 01:07:28,002
(graceful music)

1367
01:07:29,336 --> 01:07:30,671
- [Family] Amen.

1368
01:07:33,174 --> 01:07:35,009
- Thank you, everyone.

1369
01:07:36,927 --> 01:07:38,512
It's nice to hear your mother sing.

1370
01:07:38,512 --> 01:07:41,265
(graceful music)

1371
01:07:58,157 --> 01:08:00,951
Sara was sweet and liked to sing.

1372
01:08:00,951 --> 01:08:03,329
She had the nickname Sparrow.

1373
01:08:03,329 --> 01:08:06,999
But Beth, Beth was an
artist, just like you.

1374
01:08:08,459 --> 01:08:10,127
Always hard at work.

1375
01:08:10,961 --> 01:08:13,047
She used to like to play with clay.

1376
01:08:13,047 --> 01:08:15,424
She used to make clay children.

1377
01:08:15,424 --> 01:08:16,675
She always seemed so happy,

1378
01:08:16,675 --> 01:08:20,970
but the clay children
always seemed so sad.

1379
01:08:20,970 --> 01:08:22,764
The clay children were all destroyed,

1380
01:08:22,764 --> 01:08:24,183
just like the real children.

1381
01:08:24,183 --> 01:08:25,017
- Stop!

1382
01:08:27,353 --> 01:08:30,106
(Sarabeth sighs)

1383
01:08:59,050 --> 01:09:01,970
(energizing music)

1384
01:10:43,489 --> 01:10:45,616
- Stop shaking.
- Sorry.

1385
01:10:45,616 --> 01:10:47,409
- Are you nervous?

1386
01:10:47,409 --> 01:10:48,869
- I invited some gallery owners.

1387
01:10:48,869 --> 01:10:51,830
- Oh, they're gonna love it.

1388
01:10:51,830 --> 01:10:52,790
- I wish we could just stay home

1389
01:10:52,790 --> 01:10:54,916
til they're all done looking.

1390
01:10:54,916 --> 01:10:56,335
- What?

1391
01:10:56,335 --> 01:10:58,796
Baby, you are way too
talented and gorgeous

1392
01:10:58,796 --> 01:11:01,048
to shrink away from anyone.

1393
01:11:04,885 --> 01:11:07,221
- Let's just put my hair up.

1394
01:11:09,098 --> 01:11:11,892
- I always knew I'd be going
to things like this with you.

1395
01:11:11,892 --> 01:11:14,728
(Raquel chuckles)

1396
01:11:16,188 --> 01:11:18,773
- Yo, yo, yo woman of the hour!

1397
01:11:20,359 --> 01:11:21,527
You've got some kooky thoughts

1398
01:11:21,527 --> 01:11:23,946
swimming through that
head of yours, Sarabeth.

1399
01:11:23,946 --> 01:11:24,822
- [Charlotte] This is the kind of work

1400
01:11:24,822 --> 01:11:27,241
you have to go home and think about.

1401
01:11:27,241 --> 01:11:29,285
- Great job, I really mean it.

1402
01:11:29,285 --> 01:11:30,911
- Wow, I totally cannot
believe how much work

1403
01:11:30,911 --> 01:11:32,329
you have done since college.

1404
01:11:32,329 --> 01:11:33,163
I'm in shock.

1405
01:11:33,163 --> 01:11:34,206
- You're so talented.
- It's amazing.

1406
01:11:34,206 --> 01:11:36,041
- What's your favorite work?

1407
01:11:36,041 --> 01:11:39,420
- Remember when you won that poster award?

1408
01:11:39,420 --> 01:11:41,255
- And it's only the beginning.

1409
01:11:41,255 --> 01:11:42,548
Congratulations.
- Thanks.

1410
01:11:42,548 --> 01:11:44,842
- Oh my god, so, please,
please, tell us about it.

1411
01:11:44,842 --> 01:11:46,802
- Yeah, I have, trust me.

1412
01:11:46,802 --> 01:11:49,054
You know what, I'm gonna be right back.

1413
01:11:49,054 --> 01:11:51,389
- Congrats.
- Thank you.

1414
01:11:51,389 --> 01:11:54,393
(people chattering)

1415
01:11:59,315 --> 01:12:02,067
(Sarabeth sighs)

1416
01:12:09,491 --> 01:12:10,326
- Simon.

1417
01:12:11,410 --> 01:12:12,952
- I hope you don't mind.

1418
01:12:12,952 --> 01:12:14,746
I couldn't not come.

1419
01:12:14,746 --> 01:12:17,541
I tried to stay in the background.

1420
01:12:20,169 --> 01:12:22,254
- How are you?
- Good.

1421
01:12:22,254 --> 01:12:23,088
I'm good.

1422
01:12:24,255 --> 01:12:25,507
You look great.

1423
01:12:29,261 --> 01:12:31,638
Baby, this show is incredible.

1424
01:12:31,638 --> 01:12:33,724
I'm really proud of you.

1425
01:12:33,724 --> 01:12:34,558
- Thanks.

1426
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:55,621
My dad's really sick.

1427
01:12:55,621 --> 01:12:56,496
- I just saw him.

1428
01:12:56,496 --> 01:12:58,582
He was dragging your cousins around.

1429
01:12:58,582 --> 01:12:59,500
He was gloating about you.

1430
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:00,751
He looked good.

1431
01:13:02,127 --> 01:13:04,213
Your mother glared at me.

1432
01:13:04,213 --> 01:13:05,214
She looks good to.

1433
01:13:05,214 --> 01:13:08,217
(Sarabeth chuckles)

1434
01:13:13,972 --> 01:13:16,308
- How's Pennsylvania?
- Good.

1435
01:13:17,601 --> 01:13:19,686
I bought a boat.

1436
01:13:19,686 --> 01:13:20,771
- A boat?

1437
01:13:20,771 --> 01:13:25,526
- Yeah, I'm renting some
dock space on the lake.

1438
01:13:25,526 --> 01:13:27,193
- You bought a boat?

1439
01:13:28,779 --> 01:13:33,450
- Maybe when it gets nice
out, I'll take you for a ride.

1440
01:13:35,702 --> 01:13:36,537
- A boat.

1441
01:13:37,413 --> 01:13:39,206
- [Raquel] Hey, Simon.

1442
01:13:39,206 --> 01:13:40,082
- Hey.

1443
01:13:40,082 --> 01:13:41,750
- Thanks for coming.

1444
01:13:42,584 --> 01:13:45,587
Wanna come say hi to Mom and Dad?

1445
01:13:45,587 --> 01:13:47,589
- All right, I gotta go.

1446
01:13:53,387 --> 01:13:58,058
- I still think about the loft
room as your painting room.

1447
01:13:58,058 --> 01:14:00,602
Baby, I haven't done anything to it.

1448
01:14:00,602 --> 01:14:05,607
(people chattering)
(jazz music)

1449
01:14:17,411 --> 01:14:22,416
- Sara and Beth, (speaking
foreign language).

1450
01:14:23,584 --> 01:14:25,002
- [Raquel] Can you believe it?

1451
01:14:25,002 --> 01:14:27,421
- [Isaac] I'm speechless.

1452
01:14:27,421 --> 01:14:29,755
- [Howie] That's even harder to believe.

1453
01:14:29,755 --> 01:14:31,467
- Oh, Howard.

1454
01:14:31,467 --> 01:14:33,802
Darling, when did you do all this?

1455
01:14:33,802 --> 01:14:36,346
- Mostly after Hanukkah.

1456
01:14:36,346 --> 01:14:37,848
- You never wanted to listen,

1457
01:14:37,848 --> 01:14:40,392
but you always made Sara, Beth,

1458
01:14:40,392 --> 01:14:43,145
and my mother so proud in heaven.

1459
01:14:47,023 --> 01:14:50,318
- They would want you to
work things out with Becky.

1460
01:14:50,318 --> 01:14:51,487
- Everything with Becky's fine.

1461
01:14:51,487 --> 01:14:54,781
She has a few problems,
and we're standing by her.

1462
01:14:54,781 --> 01:14:57,534
- This is what we need to
get ourselves ready for?

1463
01:14:57,534 --> 01:14:59,536
Is that what you're trying to say?

1464
01:14:59,536 --> 01:15:02,206
- Yeah, if we're lucky and
Becky finds a nice Jewish girl.

1465
01:15:02,206 --> 01:15:03,373
(Ruthie speaking foreign language)

1466
01:15:03,373 --> 01:15:04,249
- Maybe we should be happy

1467
01:15:04,249 --> 01:15:05,959
there's a Chuppah, Ruthie.

1468
01:15:05,959 --> 01:15:07,503
At least there's a Chuppah.

1469
01:15:07,503 --> 01:15:08,879
(Ruthie snaps)

1470
01:15:08,879 --> 01:15:10,130
- I'm ecstatic.

1471
01:15:10,130 --> 01:15:12,007
Is that Simon Stanton you were talking to?

1472
01:15:12,007 --> 01:15:13,300
What does he want?

1473
01:15:13,300 --> 01:15:14,635
- He came to see the show.

1474
01:15:14,635 --> 01:15:15,511
- Really?

1475
01:15:15,511 --> 01:15:17,471
He should be so lucky
to get your autograph.

1476
01:15:17,471 --> 01:15:19,848
(jazz music)

1477
01:15:25,646 --> 01:15:28,148
- Mom, Dad, I want you to meet

1478
01:15:30,526 --> 01:15:33,195
my nice Jewish girlfriend Naomi.

1479
01:15:35,822 --> 01:15:36,865
- Hi.

1480
01:15:36,865 --> 01:15:38,867
- Hi, Naomi.
- Hi, Naomi.

1481
01:15:40,077 --> 01:15:44,164
- Naomi is getting her PhD
in Comparative Religions.

1482
01:15:44,164 --> 01:15:48,126
Her father is a dentist,
and her mother is a teacher.

1483
01:15:48,126 --> 01:15:50,254
She has everything you
could possibly hope for

1484
01:15:50,254 --> 01:15:52,047
in a life-partner for me.

1485
01:15:52,047 --> 01:15:56,218
- Actually, she's missing
something pretty crucial.

1486
01:15:56,218 --> 01:15:57,636
- It's just love.

1487
01:15:59,763 --> 01:16:02,014
It's not really so strange.

1488
01:16:03,183 --> 01:16:05,434
- Naomi, how ironic, Naomi.

1489
01:16:11,148 --> 01:16:15,445
In the Book of Ruth, Ruth says
to her mother-in-law Naomi,

1490
01:16:15,445 --> 01:16:18,574
"Whither thou goest, I shall go.

1491
01:16:18,574 --> 01:16:20,576
"Thy land shall be my land."

1492
01:16:20,576 --> 01:16:23,077
- "And thy people, my people."

1493
01:16:25,163 --> 01:16:29,668
- Naomi, would you like to
come to the Passover Seder?

1494
01:16:37,884 --> 01:16:39,761
- I would love to.

1495
01:16:39,761 --> 01:16:41,555
My parents are in Florida.

1496
01:16:41,555 --> 01:16:44,099
- Well, then it's settled.

1497
01:16:44,099 --> 01:16:44,933
- I'm not so sure it's settled.

1498
01:16:44,933 --> 01:16:46,226
I may need more time, but, meanwhile,

1499
01:16:46,226 --> 01:16:47,978
you'll come, you'll eat.

1500
01:16:47,978 --> 01:16:49,146
Now, where's the bathroom?

1501
01:16:49,146 --> 01:16:51,106
- Well, Ma, the Progressive Women's room

1502
01:16:51,106 --> 01:16:54,735
is right over there,
and I think you qualify.

1503
01:16:54,735 --> 01:16:56,028
- Do they have toilets, or do I have

1504
01:16:56,028 --> 01:16:58,112
to straddle a urinal to prove my point?

1505
01:16:58,112 --> 01:16:59,698
(Sarabeth chuckles)

1506
01:16:59,698 --> 01:17:02,117
(jazz music)

1507
01:17:18,842 --> 01:17:20,927
- That was all so exciting.

1508
01:17:20,927 --> 01:17:24,431
- You were amazing, you sparkled in there.

1509
01:17:26,308 --> 01:17:28,644
- I'm sure if any gallery
owners did show up,

1510
01:17:28,644 --> 01:17:30,646
they would've loved you.

1511
01:17:31,730 --> 01:17:33,398
We'll buy another painting.

1512
01:17:33,398 --> 01:17:37,443
- Yeah, anybody got any money? (laughs)

1513
01:17:37,443 --> 01:17:39,237
Sorry, honey.

1514
01:17:39,237 --> 01:17:41,823
- So many of your friends came.

1515
01:17:45,160 --> 01:17:48,746
- I have a long way to
go before I'm great.

1516
01:17:49,748 --> 01:17:52,459
- But it's all so worth it.

1517
01:17:52,459 --> 01:17:53,794
It's so obvious.

1518
01:17:54,710 --> 01:17:56,922
- Daddy seemed okay, right?

1519
01:17:56,922 --> 01:17:59,007
- Honey, he's not going
anywhere for a long time,

1520
01:17:59,007 --> 01:18:00,050
so don't worry about it.

1521
01:18:00,050 --> 01:18:01,968
- You guys have both
your cars here, right?

1522
01:18:01,968 --> 01:18:02,928
Can I please borrow one?

1523
01:18:02,928 --> 01:18:03,929
I'll bring it back in the morning.

1524
01:18:03,929 --> 01:18:04,763
- [Raquel] Where you going?

1525
01:18:04,763 --> 01:18:05,597
It's almost midnight.

1526
01:18:05,597 --> 01:18:06,598
- Do you need a ride?

1527
01:18:06,598 --> 01:18:08,350
- No, I just need to think.

1528
01:18:08,350 --> 01:18:10,434
Sometimes I like to drive and think.

1529
01:18:10,434 --> 01:18:11,520
- Are you upset about Daddy?

1530
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:13,105
- I just have some decisions to make.

1531
01:18:13,105 --> 01:18:15,023
- [Raquel] About Simon?

1532
01:18:15,023 --> 01:18:16,400
- [Becky] You're not
gonna go back to him now.

1533
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:18,151
What about your painting?

1534
01:18:18,151 --> 01:18:19,236
- Look, it's late.

1535
01:18:19,236 --> 01:18:20,237
Why don't you wait til the morning,

1536
01:18:20,237 --> 01:18:21,362
then you'll make the right decision.

1537
01:18:21,362 --> 01:18:23,073
- No, I can't make any
decisions right now.

1538
01:18:23,073 --> 01:18:25,784
I just have to go, I just
have to get in the car and go,

1539
01:18:25,784 --> 01:18:26,660
I have to get out of here!

1540
01:18:26,660 --> 01:18:28,036
- Okay, okay.

1541
01:18:28,036 --> 01:18:30,205
Just drive carefully.

1542
01:18:30,205 --> 01:18:31,456
- Whatever decision makes you less sick

1543
01:18:31,456 --> 01:18:34,209
to your stomach is the right one.

1544
01:18:36,670 --> 01:18:40,005
(soft, emotional music)

1545
01:19:34,603 --> 01:19:37,606
(Sarabeth sniffles)

1546
01:19:56,708 --> 01:20:00,337
(dramatic, emotional music)

1547
01:20:11,764 --> 01:20:15,477
- [Sarabeth Voiceover]
If I am not for myself,

1548
01:20:15,477 --> 01:20:17,062
who will be for me?

1549
01:20:20,982 --> 01:20:24,152
But if I'm only for myself, what am I?

1550
01:20:28,615 --> 01:20:30,367
And if not now, when?

1551
01:20:31,660 --> 01:20:35,330
(dramatic, emotional music)

1552
01:20:40,293 --> 01:20:43,880
(upbeat, energizing music)

1553
01:21:56,786 --> 01:22:00,290
(funky, percussive music)
