Don't listen to them. Okay.

And that's why people
shouldn't do drugs.

388

It weakens their defenses.

It's true. That's why I
stopped doing the hard stuff.

the most beautiful eyes.

1034
01:07:40,588 --> 01:07:43,467
What are you doing?
Let's go.

1035
01:07:43,525 --> 01:07:45,630
No.

1036
01:07:45,694 --> 01:07:49,608
No, you listen to me.
My daughter is missing.

1037
01:07:49,631 --> 01:07:52,043
Someone's been killed
in my house.

1038
01:07:52,100 --> 01:07:53,875
My house.

1039
01:07:53,935 --> 01:07:56,882
I think we have a lot
to figure out, all right'?

1040
01:07:59,341 --> 01:08:03,517
Yeah, I'm just...
I'm just a little scared.

1041
01:08:03,578 --> 01:08:04,648
I'm freaked out.

1042
01:08:04,713 --> 01:08:07,751
It's all right
to be freaked out.

1043
01:08:07,782 --> 01:08:11,628
You just got to try
and remain calm.

1044
01:08:11,653 --> 01:08:13,963
Everything's going to work out.

1045
01:08:14,022 --> 01:08:16,764
It's going to be fine.

1046
01:08:16,791 --> 01:08:18,896
Get off of me.
No, no, no.

1047
01:08:18,927 --> 01:08:20,702
Stop.

1048
01:08:24,132 --> 01:08:27,079
Good job, baby.
It's all right.

1049
01:08:39,981 --> 01:08:43,394
Oh, God, I love this purse.

1050
01:08:44,753 --> 01:08:46,926
It's one of my favorites.

1051
01:08:49,124 --> 01:08:52,936
<i>You think she's out?
I don? Know.</i>

1052
01:08:52,961 --> 01:08:55,840
Little bitch
might be faking it.

1053
01:08:57,532 --> 01:08:59,534
[screaming]

1054
01:08:59,567 --> 01:09:02,741
Get off me.
Let me go.

1055
01:09:02,804 --> 01:09:05,080
No.

1056
01:09:05,106 --> 01:09:06,676
Get a rope.
Yeah.

1057
01:09:08,510 --> 01:09:11,013
<i>Help me.
No!</i>

1058
01:09:11,079 --> 01:09:13,423
Calm down.
Somebody help me.

1059
01:09:13,448 --> 01:09:15,428
Calm down.
Calm down.

1060
01:11:04,726 --> 01:11:06,069
<i>[growling]</i>

1061
01:12:38,753 --> 01:12:40,357
I'm going to get you
out of here.

<i>(Wayne) Always masterful.</i>

1065
01:13:13,221 --> 01:13:16,930
He does it different
every time.

1066
01:13:21,829 --> 01:13:23,934
Has he shown himself to you'?

1067
01:13:27,035 --> 01:13:29,413
Sometimes he does,

1068
01:13:29,671 --> 01:13:31,844
and sometimes he doesn't.

1069
01:13:31,906 --> 01:13:36,252
He first appeared to me
the night of the fire.

1070
01:13:38,112 --> 01:13:39,921
My business burned.

1071
01:13:41,849 --> 01:13:45,228
Lucy was dropped in the flames.

1072
01:13:49,057 --> 01:13:51,697
He gave me the option
to save her,

1073
01:13:51,759 --> 01:13:55,969
but then I would have to build
an army of children.

1074
01:13:59,100 --> 01:14:04,015
He chose me,
just like he's chosen you.

1075
01:14:05,373 --> 01:14:08,047
All those children

1076
01:14:08,109 --> 01:14:10,885
are his.

1077
01:14:10,945 --> 01:14:15,758
I've created them
with different women.

1078
01:14:15,817 --> 01:14:20,766
In different shapes,
in different sizes.

1079
01:14:24,425 --> 01:14:27,269
And he has told me
that you are special.

1080
01:14:34,235 --> 01:14:35,976
[murmuring]

1081
01:14:37,872 --> 01:14:39,909
The sun will darken.

1082
01:14:41,042 --> 01:14:43,283
The moon will not give light.

1083
01:14:43,311 --> 01:14:47,316
The stars,
they'll fall from the sky.

1084
01:14:50,118 --> 01:14:53,361
And the third part
of man will be slain.

1085
01:14:55,189 --> 01:14:59,296
They shall set the fire
upon Magog,

1086
01:14:59,327 --> 01:15:01,034
but he will not perish.

1087
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:09,074
<i>And the fire shall be set upon
Magog but he shall not perish.</i>

1088
01:15:09,137 --> 01:15:10,912
He shall seek vengeance.

1089
01:15:14,776 --> 01:15:17,382
There will be a great culling.

1090
01:15:17,445 --> 01:15:20,449
A culling of mankind, and he shall
reign for a thousand years.

1091
01:15:21,182 --> 01:15:22,786
And we shall be with him.
