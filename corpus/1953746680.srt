10
00:00:20,819 --> 00:00:22,736

13
00:00:25,958 --> 00:00:28,625
<i>He had to survive...</i>

14
00:00:28,627 --> 00:00:30,544
You want survive? You kill.

15
00:00:30,546 --> 00:00:32,996

<i>But not as Oliver Queen.</i>

20

<i>As something else.</i>

21

25
00:00:58,407 --> 00:01:00,457
<i>Delivering justice</i>

(Laurel) What makes you so sure

32
00:01:10,552 --> 00:01:11,784
<i>His enemies many.</i>

41
00:01:27,102 --> 00:01:29,102
And it would take everything...

42

You might just
have a chance.

No, you can't!

Why should I trust you?!

46
00:01:36,278 --> 00:01:38,695
You should make up

The Starling City resident

57
00:02:02,424 --> 00:02:04,925

as deceased.

58
00:02:04,927 --> 00:02:08,094
When Oliver Queen returned home
<i>to Starling City,</i>

59
00:02:08,096 --> 00:02:10,130
<i>he was not</i>
<i>the same spoiled rich kid</i>

60
00:02:10,132 --> 00:02:12,248
<i>who had disappeared at sea.</i>

61
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:16,085

<i>The lavish life</i>
<i>he had once taken for granted</i>

(Tommy) Okay,
what else did you miss?

65
00:02:24,596 --> 00:02:28,815
Super Bowl winners--giants,
Steelers, Saints, Packers.

66
00:02:28,817 --> 00:02:29,983
A black president--that's new.

67
00:02:29,985 --> 00:02:32,118
What was it like there?

68
00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:36,873
(Water lapping)

69
00:02:38,709 --> 00:02:40,160
Cold.

70
00:02:42,213 --> 00:02:44,381
<i>Everything around him</i>

Walter and I are married.

73
00:02:51,523 --> 00:02:53,924
And I don't want you to think
that either one of us

74
00:02:53,926 --> 00:02:56,943
did anything
to disrespect your father.

75
00:02:57,929 --> 00:03:00,230
<i>His sister Thea</i>

No one's called me that

80
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:10,023
Worst nickname ever.

81
00:03:13,277 --> 00:03:15,245
<i>Thea had been managing</i>
<i>her grief</i>

82
00:03:15,247 --> 00:03:16,863
<i>in less than healthy ways.</i>

83
00:03:16,865 --> 00:03:19,282
My brother and my father
died.

84
00:03:19,284 --> 00:03:20,984
I went to your funeral.

85
00:03:20,986 --> 00:03:22,752
You can't come back here
and judge me,

86
00:03:22,754 --> 00:03:24,704
especially for being
just like you.

87
00:03:24,706 --> 00:03:28,875
<i>This</i> me--the best I could do

89
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:35,632
Steaks at the Palm?
Drinks at the Station?

90
00:03:35,634 --> 00:03:36,783
Meaningless sex?

91
00:03:36,785 --> 00:03:39,302
Laurel.

92
00:03:39,304 --> 00:03:42,505
Everyone is happy

93
00:03:42,507 --> 00:03:44,107
You wanna see the one person
who isn't?

94
00:03:44,109 --> 00:03:45,442
Hello, Laurel.

95
00:03:47,945 --> 00:03:50,847
Hunt has an army of lawyers,
and they are ready to bury us.

96
00:03:50,849 --> 00:03:53,783
You and I against many.
I love those odds.

97
00:03:53,785 --> 00:03:54,818
Why do you hate me?

98

101
00:04:02,594 --> 00:04:04,327
<i>Laurel was tough.</i>

102

Why are you here, Ollie?
<i>She had to be...</i>

103
00:04:06,298 --> 00:04:07,547
To apologize.

104
00:04:07,549 --> 00:04:09,215
<i>After what Oliver had done.</i>

105
00:04:09,217 --> 00:04:10,917

Aah!

108
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:20,060
Sara!

109
00:04:20,062 --> 00:04:22,312
I couldn't grieve
because I was so angry.

110
00:04:22,314 --> 00:04:24,380
That's what happens

111
00:04:24,382 --> 00:04:25,765
when your sister dies
while screwing your boyfriend.

112
00:04:25,767 --> 00:04:27,717
It should've been you.

113
00:04:27,719 --> 00:04:28,852
I'd hoped that
you'd rot in hell

114
00:04:28,854 --> 00:04:31,187
a whole lot longer
than five years.

115
00:04:31,189 --> 00:04:34,407
No! No! Help!
Dad, she's out there!

116
00:04:34,409 --> 00:04:36,576
She's not there!
She's gone.

117
00:04:37,662 --> 00:04:41,230
<i>Laurel wasn't the only one</i>
<i>who was angry.</i>

118
00:04:41,232 --> 00:04:43,083
Did you even try to save her?

119
00:04:44,919 --> 00:04:46,569
Did you even try to save
my daughter?

120
00:04:46,571 --> 00:04:47,871
(Lucas)
Okay, let's go, partner.

121
00:04:47,873 --> 00:04:49,122
Fine.

122
00:04:49,124 --> 00:04:51,124
<i>Her father,</i>
<i>Detective Quentin Lance,</i>

<i>never recovered from the loss</i>
<i>of his daughter Sara.</i>

124
00:04:54,629 --> 00:04:56,796
Let's go.
(Clears throat)

125

<i>He wasn't ready to forgive,</i>

126
00:04:58,917 --> 00:05:01,384
<i>but Oliver was much better</i>
<i>at letting go.</i>

127
00:05:01,386 --> 00:05:05,555
How much do you know about your
own so-called friends over here?

Well, I guess

while you were gone.

132
00:05:14,316 --> 00:05:16,032

And this attorney--

178
00:07:21,276 --> 00:07:22,859
(electricity crackles)

179
00:07:22,861 --> 00:07:24,160
Uhh!
Get in the car!

180
00:07:24,162 --> 00:07:26,279
<i>Oliver wouldn't be able to</i>
<i>carry out this justice</i>

181
00:07:26,281 --> 00:07:27,614
<i>as himself.</i>

182
00:07:27,616 --> 00:07:29,782
<i>He needed to live</i>
<i>in the shadows.</i>

183
00:07:29,784 --> 00:07:32,702
<i>He would have to become</i>
<i>someone else...</i>

184
00:07:32,704 --> 00:07:35,088
<i>something else.</i>

185
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:37,006
You're gonna transfer
$40 million

186
00:07:37,008 --> 00:07:38,458
by 10:00 p.m. tomorrow night.

187
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:39,575
Or what?

188
00:07:39,577 --> 00:07:41,377
Or I'm gonna take it,
and you won't like how.

189
00:07:41,379 --> 00:07:43,346
(Slaps hand)
He was wearing a hood.

190
00:07:43,348 --> 00:07:45,765
A green hood.

191
00:07:45,767 --> 00:07:47,350
And he had a bow and arrow.

192
00:07:47,352 --> 00:07:49,853
We'll put out
an A.P.B. on...

193
00:07:49,855 --> 00:07:51,304
Robin Hood.

194
00:07:51,306 --> 00:07:52,972
He said he would be back here
by 10:00 p.m.

195
00:07:52,974 --> 00:07:54,524
Make sure you're here first.

196
00:07:54,526 --> 00:07:56,276
He's never gonna get in.

197
00:07:56,278 --> 00:07:58,478
(Electricity powers down)

198
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,646
(Elevator bell dings)

199
00:07:59,648 --> 00:08:02,065
Uhh! Uhh!

200
00:08:09,273 --> 00:08:11,824
You missed.
Really?

201
00:08:15,796 --> 00:08:17,947
(Metal clanks)

202
00:08:17,949 --> 00:08:20,116
(Helicopter whirring overhead)

203
00:08:20,118 --> 00:08:22,802
Tell me you saw that.

204
00:08:22,804 --> 00:08:24,003
Untraceable?!

205
00:08:24,005 --> 00:08:26,222
It is $40 million!

206
00:08:26,224 --> 00:08:28,675
Find it!

207
00:08:28,677 --> 00:08:30,009
(Exhales deeply)

208
00:08:30,011 --> 00:08:31,844
How did he do it?

209
00:08:37,467 --> 00:08:41,788
<i>His war on Starling City's</i>
<i>cancerous criminal elite</i>

210
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:43,907
<i>had begun.</i>

211
00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:48,611
<i>But Oliver never imagined</i>
<i>the extent of the disease...</i>

212
00:08:48,613 --> 00:08:51,814
<i>or just how far it had spread.</i>

213
00:08:51,816 --> 00:08:53,499
My son knows nothing.

214
00:08:53,501 --> 00:08:56,920
You know, Robert didn't tell him
anything that could hurt us.

215
00:08:56,922 --> 00:09:00,673
And he has no idea that
the yacht was sabotaged.

216
00:09:08,963 --> 00:09:10,997
(Man) Who's that?
Where'd he come from?

217
00:09:10,999 --> 00:09:13,516
Working from his father's list,

218
00:09:13,518 --> 00:09:15,852
Oliver Queen systematically took down

219
00:09:15,854 --> 00:09:18,838
<i>the worst of Starling City's</i>
<i>corrupt and powerful...</i>

220
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,607
Please! No, please!
Marcus Redmond,

221
00:09:20,609 --> 00:09:21,858
you failed this city.

222
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,359
Please don't! Please don't!

223
00:09:23,361 --> 00:09:25,511
<i>Administering brutal justice.</i>

224
00:09:25,513 --> 00:09:26,479
Aah! Aah!

225
00:09:26,481 --> 00:09:28,364
You're gonna testify
in that trial.

226
00:09:28,366 --> 00:09:31,350
You're gonna confess to having
Victor Nocenti killed.

227
00:09:31,352 --> 00:09:32,351
Please, no! Aah!

228
00:09:32,353 --> 00:09:34,404
<i>No one knew</i>
<i>who the vigilante was,</i>

229
00:09:34,406 --> 00:09:38,324
<i>but his exploits</i>
<i>quickly became notorious.</i>

230
00:09:38,326 --> 00:09:40,543
This guy gets more airtime
than the Kardashians.

231
00:09:40,545 --> 00:09:43,163
This city used to be different.
People used to feel safe.

232
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:44,414
Afraid we're gonna be next?

233
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:45,915
(Siren wailing)

234
00:09:45,917 --> 00:09:47,667
<i>He gained the attention</i>
<i>of the law...</i>

235
00:09:47,669 --> 00:09:49,202
Freeze!

236
00:09:49,204 --> 00:09:50,920
Bow down, hands up.

237
00:09:50,922 --> 00:09:52,472
(Clank)

238
00:09:55,893 --> 00:10:00,146
<i>And earn notice from enemies</i>
<i>he didn't yet know existed.</i>

239
00:10:00,148 --> 00:10:02,682
A modern day Robin Hood.

240
00:10:02,684 --> 00:10:05,435
Jason Brodeur.

241
00:10:05,437 --> 00:10:07,103
Adam Hunt.

242
00:10:07,105 --> 00:10:08,821
Warren Patel.

243
00:10:08,823 --> 00:10:11,357
Tell me you see a connection,
Moira.

244
00:10:11,359 --> 00:10:12,625
He's not targeting the rich.

245
00:10:12,627 --> 00:10:14,577
No, he's not.

246
00:10:14,579 --> 00:10:15,995
He's targeting the list.

247
00:10:19,733 --> 00:10:23,853
<i>Secrets and lies were critical</i>
<i>to survival,</i>

248
00:10:23,855 --> 00:10:25,071
<i>so to the public,</i>

249
00:10:25,073 --> 00:10:26,890
<i>he was the rich playboy</i>
<i>he had always been.</i>

250
00:10:26,892 --> 00:10:28,508
I miss Tequila!

251
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:30,293
(Cheering)

252
00:10:30,295 --> 00:10:32,445
<i>To the Russian</i> Bratva,

253
00:10:32,447 --> 00:10:33,630
<i>he was a captain.</i>

254
00:10:33,632 --> 00:10:35,014
<i>And after earning</i>
<i>their trust...</i>

255
00:10:35,016 --> 00:10:36,416
Pleased to meet you.

256
00:10:36,418 --> 00:10:38,768
<i>They provided</i>
<i>valuable information</i>

257
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:40,770
about the criminal underground.

258
00:10:40,772 --> 00:10:43,940
<i>But to Oliver's family,</i>
<i>he was a ghost.</i>

259
00:10:43,942 --> 00:10:46,442
I felt closer to you
when you were dead.

260
00:10:46,444 --> 00:10:49,262
Look, I know it was hell
where you were,

261
00:10:49,264 --> 00:10:51,281
but it was hell here, too.

262
00:10:51,283 --> 00:10:52,765
You gotta let me in, Ollie.

263
00:10:52,767 --> 00:10:55,518
You gotta let <i>someone</i> in.

264
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,103
(Moira) Oliver.

265
00:10:57,105 --> 00:10:59,122
I wanna introduce you
to someone.

266
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,160
(Oliver) What do I call you?

267
00:11:04,162 --> 00:11:05,211
(John) Diggle's good.

268
00:11:05,213 --> 00:11:08,298
<i>To his new bodyguard</i>
<i>John Diggle...</i>

269
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,582
So...

270
00:11:09,584 --> 00:11:11,718
<i>Oliver would be an extremely</i>
<i>difficult assignment.</i>

271
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,253
You're ex-military?
Yes, sir.

272
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:16,422
105th Airborne
out of Kandahar. Retired.

273
00:11:16,424 --> 00:11:17,807
I don't want there to be
any confusion, Mr. Queen.

274
00:11:17,809 --> 00:11:19,792
My ability to keep you from harm
will outweigh your comfort.

275
00:11:19,794 --> 00:11:20,877
(Car door opens and closes)

276
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:23,462
(Car horns honk,
tires screech)

277
00:11:24,648 --> 00:11:27,150
<i>Years before,</i>
<i>Diggle's brother was murdered</i>

278
00:11:27,152 --> 00:11:30,236
<i>by a vicious assassin</i>
<i>called Deadshot,</i>

279
00:11:30,238 --> 00:11:33,639
<i>who had recently returned</i>
<i>to Starling City.</i>

280
00:11:33,641 --> 00:11:34,974
(Gunshot)

281
00:11:34,976 --> 00:11:36,442
Aah!
(Woman screams)

282
00:11:36,444 --> 00:11:38,811
<i>Oliver faced off</i>
<i>with the killer...</i>

283
00:11:47,454 --> 00:11:48,638
Uhh!
(Thud)

284
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,957
<i>And took him out,</i>

285
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:52,325
<i>but not before</i>

286
00:11:52,327 --> 00:11:54,961
<i>one of Deadshot's</i>
<i>signature poison-laced bullets</i>

287
00:11:54,963 --> 00:11:56,829
<i>ended up in Diggle.</i>

288
00:11:56,831 --> 00:11:59,165
<i>After saving</i>
<i>his bodyguard's life,</i>

289
00:11:59,167 --> 00:12:03,019
<i>Oliver decided it was time</i>
<i>to let him in on his secret.</i>

290
00:12:03,021 --> 00:12:04,354
You're that vigilante.

291
00:12:04,356 --> 00:12:06,939
Starling City is dying.

292
00:12:06,941 --> 00:12:10,843
It is being poisoned
by a criminal elite

293
00:12:10,845 --> 00:12:14,397
who don't care
who they hurt.

294
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:15,698
And what are you gonna do?

295
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,650
Take 'em all down
by your lonesome?

296
00:12:17,652 --> 00:12:19,852
No, I want you to join me.

297
00:12:19,854 --> 00:12:21,571
Here's the security footage

298
00:12:21,573 --> 00:12:23,289
from the Exchange building
shooting.

299
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:26,025
<i>While investigating</i>
<i>the Deadshot incident,</i>

300
00:12:26,027 --> 00:12:28,628
<i>Detective Lance made</i>
<i>a shocking discovery.</i>

301
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:29,829
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What?

302
00:12:29,831 --> 00:12:32,799
Wait, go back 10 seconds.
What is that?

303
00:12:32,801 --> 00:12:34,884
(Taps button)
I'll be damned.

304
00:12:36,804 --> 00:12:38,471
(Oliver)
What the hell is going on?!

305
00:12:38,473 --> 00:12:39,639
(Thea) What's happening?!
Oliver Queen, you're under arrest

306
00:12:39,641 --> 00:12:41,140
on suspicion
of obstruction of justice,

307
00:12:41,142 --> 00:12:42,342
aggravated assault...
What?!

308
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:44,811
Acting as a vigilante,
and murder.

309
00:12:44,813 --> 00:12:46,095
Who's your attorney,
Mr. Queen?

310
00:12:46,097 --> 00:12:49,182
<i>The accusation made for</i>
<i>an unlikely alliance...</i>

311
00:12:49,184 --> 00:12:50,433
Dinah Laurel Lance, Your Honor.

312
00:12:50,435 --> 00:12:52,585
<i>And drove a wedge</i>
<i>between father and daughter.</i>

313
00:12:52,587 --> 00:12:54,771
You hate the hood
and you hate Oliver,

314
00:12:54,773 --> 00:12:57,407
and you want more than anything
for them to be the same person.

315
00:12:57,409 --> 00:12:59,192
<i>Oliver managed</i>
<i>to beat a polygraph.</i>

316
00:12:59,194 --> 00:13:01,861
Are you the man in this picture?
No.

317
00:13:01,863 --> 00:13:04,047
<i>The truth he</i> did <i>tell...</i>

318
00:13:04,049 --> 00:13:06,032
I didn't want to talk about what
happened to me on the island

319
00:13:06,034 --> 00:13:08,451
because the people that were
there tortured me.

320
00:13:08,453 --> 00:13:09,919
<i>Had an effect on Laurel.</i>

321
00:13:09,921 --> 00:13:12,221
(Gasps)

322
00:13:12,223 --> 00:13:13,873
How did you survive this?

323
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:16,125
There were times
when I wanted to die.

324
00:13:16,127 --> 00:13:17,643
(Gasps)

325
00:13:17,645 --> 00:13:21,547
In the end, there was something
I wanted more.

326
00:13:28,422 --> 00:13:31,974
You don't--
Laurel, you don't have to go.

327
00:13:33,093 --> 00:13:35,895
<i>House arrest provided Oliver</i>
<i>an opportunity</i>

328
00:13:35,897 --> 00:13:38,231
<i>to prove he wasn't the Hood,</i>

329
00:13:38,233 --> 00:13:39,598
<i>with a little help...</i>

330
00:13:42,286 --> 00:13:43,486
<i>From Diggle</i>

331
00:13:43,488 --> 00:13:44,987
<i>as the vigilante.</i>

332
00:13:44,989 --> 00:13:47,573
An arms dealer was attacked
across town tonight

333
00:13:47,575 --> 00:13:49,041
by the vigilante.
In light of that,

334
00:13:49,043 --> 00:13:51,494
all charges against your son
are being dropped.

335
00:13:51,496 --> 00:13:52,945
Thank you.

336
00:13:52,947 --> 00:13:54,630
<i>Once he was free,</i>

337
00:13:54,632 --> 00:13:56,615
<i>Oliver and Diggle went</i>
<i>back to work.</i>

338
00:13:56,617 --> 00:13:57,783
Ow! Uhh!

339
00:13:57,785 --> 00:13:59,552
Variable acceleration.

340
00:13:59,554 --> 00:14:00,837
Fighters work
at the same pace.

341
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:03,389
You switch it up, throw your
opponent off his game.

342
00:14:03,391 --> 00:14:05,258
That was nice.
Where'd you learn that?

343
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:07,059
His name was Yao Fei.

344
00:14:12,816 --> 00:14:15,768

00:14:29,834 --> 00:14:31,167
<i>Ex-Chinese military</i>

00:14:35,173 --> 00:14:37,039
<i>Also on the island?</i>

355
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:39,575
Do you know what
this island is named?

356
00:14:39,577 --> 00:14:41,327
Lian Yu.

357
00:14:41,329 --> 00:14:42,828
Mandarin for "Purgatory""

358
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:46,165

<i>After Yao rescued Oliver...</i>

361
00:14:57,177 --> 00:15:00,363
<i>He sent him to meet</i>

362
00:15:01,348 --> 00:15:05,585
(Gasps) Twitch and I will open
your throat.

363
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:08,154
(Strained voice)
Yao Fei sent me here,

364
00:15:08,156 --> 00:15:10,156
and I'm pretty sure it wasn't
so you could kill me.

365
00:15:10,158 --> 00:15:13,876
<i>Slade Wilson was Australian</i>
<i>secret intelligence service,</i>

368
00:15:18,967 --> 00:15:21,200
Everybody is in this life
for themselves.

369
00:15:21,202 --> 00:15:23,669
Learn that
at Australian spy school?

370
00:15:23,671 --> 00:15:26,889
No. I learned that here.

371
00:15:26,891 --> 00:15:31,710
<i>He taught Oliver that to</i>
<i>survive and escape the island,</i>

372
00:15:31,712 --> 00:15:33,930
<i>he would have to fight.</i>

373
00:15:33,932 --> 00:15:35,881
You have no skill,

374
00:15:35,883 --> 00:15:38,100
no strength,

375
00:15:38,102 --> 00:15:39,352
no training.

376
00:15:39,354 --> 00:15:42,572
I told you,
I'm not a soldier.

377
00:15:45,826 --> 00:15:47,944
Aah!

378
00:15:47,946 --> 00:15:50,396
(Laughs)
Aah!

379
00:15:50,398 --> 00:15:51,581
(Panting)

380
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:54,517
There might be a fighter
inside of you after all.

381
00:15:57,087 --> 00:15:58,571
You know, one of these days,
you're gonna be straight with me

382
00:15:58,573 --> 00:16:00,289
about what really happened
on that island.

383
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:01,791
Absolutely.

384
00:16:01,793 --> 00:16:03,342
Aah!
Aah!

385
00:16:03,344 --> 00:16:04,910
But not today.

386
00:16:04,912 --> 00:16:06,212
<i>Diggle was the only one</i>

387
00:16:06,214 --> 00:16:09,215
<i>who knew the truth</i>
<i>about Oliver's double life,</i>

388
00:16:09,217 --> 00:16:12,268
<i>but there was another</i>
<i>who Oliver turned to regularly.</i>

389
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:13,970
Felicity Smoak?

390
00:16:15,806 --> 00:16:16,889
<i>Felicity Smoak--</i>

391
00:16:16,891 --> 00:16:19,642
<i>Queen Consolidated's</i>
<i>I.T. superstar.</i>

392
00:16:19,644 --> 00:16:22,645
I was at my coffee shop
surfing the web,

393
00:16:22,647 --> 00:16:24,113
and I spilled a latte on it.

394
00:16:24,115 --> 00:16:25,498
These look like bullet holes.

395
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,233
My coffee shop is
in a bad neighborhood.

396
00:16:27,235 --> 00:16:29,569
So a friend of mine is running
a scavenger hunt.

397
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:31,704
I first need to get
through this.

398
00:16:31,706 --> 00:16:34,740
This is a military-grade
cryptographic security protocol.

399
00:16:34,742 --> 00:16:36,909
My buddy Kevin is starting
an energy drink company.

400
00:16:36,911 --> 00:16:39,278
Could you please do
a spectral analysis?

401
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,781
If it's an energy drink,

402
00:16:41,783 --> 00:16:43,583
why is it in a syringe?

403
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:45,801
I ran out of sports bottles.

404
00:16:46,753 --> 00:16:47,970
<i>Felicity was also a resource</i>

405
00:16:47,972 --> 00:16:50,923
<i>for Oliver's stepfather</i>
<i>Walter Steele.</i>

406
00:16:50,925 --> 00:16:53,459
I was hoping you could
look into something for me.

407
00:16:53,461 --> 00:16:54,610
Discreetly.

408
00:16:54,612 --> 00:16:56,012
I'm your girl.

409
00:16:57,648 --> 00:17:02,401
<i>When Walter found a mysterious</i>
<i>diary in his wife's possession,</i>

410
00:17:02,403 --> 00:17:05,071
<i>Felicity helped him decode it.</i>

411
00:17:06,073 --> 00:17:08,908
<i>It was information</i>
<i>too dangerous to hold.</i>

412
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:10,192
(Moira) Let me talk to him.

413
00:17:10,194 --> 00:17:12,912
I think we're past the point
of conversation, Moira,

414
00:17:12,914 --> 00:17:15,948
which means something
must be done about it.

415
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:18,334
(Man) Please help me welcome
Mr. Malcolm Merlyn.

416
00:17:18,336 --> 00:17:21,921
<i>Malcolm Merlyn was a titan</i>
<i>of Starling City industry.</i>

417
00:17:21,923 --> 00:17:24,123
<i>He was also Tommy's father.</i>

418
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:25,824
My wife would've liked you,
Laurel.

419
00:17:25,826 --> 00:17:28,010
Their relationship was complex.

420
00:17:28,012 --> 00:17:29,962
Well, I wish I would've
known her.

421
00:17:29,964 --> 00:17:31,997
She passed away before
Tommy and I became friends.

422
00:17:31,999 --> 00:17:33,099
She was killed, Laurel.

423
00:17:33,101 --> 00:17:34,567
There's no need
to be polite about it.

424
00:17:34,569 --> 00:17:37,603
<i>Merlyn was also</i>
<i>a man with secrets...</i>

425
00:17:37,605 --> 00:17:40,640
<i>Secrets he would do anything</i>
<i>to protect.</i>

426
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:41,840
(Grunts)

427
00:17:41,842 --> 00:17:43,192
(Malcolm) It's done.

428
00:17:43,194 --> 00:17:44,644
And he won't be harmed?

429
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:47,012
Nor will he ever discover your
involvement. You have my word.

430
00:17:47,014 --> 00:17:48,364
What's done is done.

431
00:17:48,366 --> 00:17:49,682
No, Moira.

432
00:17:49,684 --> 00:17:51,684
It's just beginning.

433
00:17:53,036 --> 00:17:55,187
(Man, modulated voice)
We must send a message.

434
00:17:55,189 --> 00:17:58,374
(Arrows whoosh)
(Squish)

435
00:17:58,376 --> 00:18:00,910
<i>When the dark archer</i>
<i>first appeared,</i>

436
00:18:00,912 --> 00:18:02,795
<i>it seemed he was just</i>
<i>an imitator</i>

437
00:18:02,797 --> 00:18:04,863
<i>in a different color hood.</i>

438
00:18:04,865 --> 00:18:08,000
<i>But when he drew Oliver</i>
<i>into a fight,</i>

439
00:18:08,002 --> 00:18:10,869
<i>his purpose was</i>
<i>curiously specific.</i>

440
00:18:10,871 --> 00:18:12,672
I know about the list,

441
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:15,224
and the man who authored it
wants you dead!

442
00:18:21,932 --> 00:18:23,232
Aah!

443
00:18:26,236 --> 00:18:28,487
Uhh! Aah! Uhh!

444
00:18:28,489 --> 00:18:33,225
Oliver knew he was dealing with
<i>somebody more than a copycat.</i>

445
00:18:33,227 --> 00:18:37,246
The other archer told me that
somebody compiled the list.

446
00:18:37,248 --> 00:18:40,700
I always assumed
it was my father.

447
00:18:40,702 --> 00:18:43,736
I think there's someone else
out there,

448
00:18:43,738 --> 00:18:48,174
someone who's more of a danger
than the archer.

449
00:18:51,511 --> 00:18:55,664
And I am gonna take him down.

450
00:19:00,537 --> 00:19:03,070
<i>While Oliver was focused</i>
<i>solely on the list...</i>

451
00:19:03,072 --> 00:19:07,375
Leo Mueller,
you have failed this city.

452
00:19:07,377 --> 00:19:08,910
<i>Others expected more of him.</i>

453
00:19:08,912 --> 00:19:10,661
Maybe you can
make a difference

454
00:19:10,663 --> 00:19:12,880
if you think beyond the scope
of those pages.

455
00:19:12,882 --> 00:19:13,948
I'm sure your father
wouldn't mind.

456
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:15,049
No, you don't get it.

457
00:19:15,051 --> 00:19:17,218
My father died
so that I could live.

458
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:20,471
Every name that I cross off
this list honors that sacrifice.

459
00:19:20,473 --> 00:19:22,723
Oliver, there's more than
one way to save this city.

460
00:19:22,725 --> 00:19:24,124
Not for me.

461
00:19:24,126 --> 00:19:26,761
It sounds like you have a narrow
definition of being a hero.

462
00:19:26,763 --> 00:19:28,128
I'm not a hero.

463
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:29,463
<i>Hero or not,</i>

464
00:19:29,465 --> 00:19:33,234
<i>more of his missions took him</i>
<i>outside of the list.</i>

465
00:19:33,236 --> 00:19:34,352
Aah!

466
00:19:34,354 --> 00:19:36,437
<i>He took down drug dealers...</i>

467
00:19:36,439 --> 00:19:38,322
Enjoy
the fruits of your labor.

468
00:19:38,324 --> 00:19:39,824
(Groans)

469
00:19:39,826 --> 00:19:41,692
<i>Psychopathic murderers...</i>

470
00:19:42,978 --> 00:19:45,079
<i>A family of thieves.</i>

471
00:19:45,081 --> 00:19:46,914
Drop your weapons!
I got this!

472
00:19:46,916 --> 00:19:48,499
No! Uhh!

473
00:19:48,501 --> 00:19:50,535
<i>And at times,</i>
<i>he showed compassion</i>

474
00:19:50,537 --> 00:19:54,338
<i>towards those driven to crime</i>
<i>by the city his father failed.</i>

475
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:55,673
It wasn't his fault.

476
00:19:55,675 --> 00:19:58,793
(Breathes heavily)
I turned my son into this.

477
00:19:58,795 --> 00:20:01,796
If your dad could've
seen you this week,

478
00:20:01,798 --> 00:20:03,581
the way you cared about
the people he had hurt,

479
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:06,100
the way you stepped up
to try to help them...

480
00:20:06,102 --> 00:20:08,102
I'd say he'd be
pretty damn honored.

481
00:20:10,188 --> 00:20:11,672
I can't imagine

482
00:20:11,674 --> 00:20:13,891
you want the death
of an innocent young woman

483
00:20:13,893 --> 00:20:16,694
on your hands,
not with your principles.

484
00:20:16,696 --> 00:20:18,062
Aah!

485
00:20:21,016 --> 00:20:23,117
(Yao Fei) No!
Hey!

486
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:24,151
Uhh!

487
00:20:24,153 --> 00:20:26,287
<i>Shado was Yao Fei's daughter,</i>

488
00:20:26,289 --> 00:20:29,189
<i>brought from mainland China</i>
<i>to Lian Yu</i>

489
00:20:29,191 --> 00:20:31,626
to use as leverage against Yao.

490
00:20:31,628 --> 00:20:33,044
No.

491
00:20:33,046 --> 00:20:36,213
<i>It soon became apparent that</i>
<i>Shado was not an ideal captive.</i>

492
00:20:36,215 --> 00:20:37,798
Let the girl go.

493
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,550
(Fyers) Kill her!
No!

494
00:20:39,552 --> 00:20:42,202
<i>And she proved she was</i>
<i>her father's daughter.</i>

495
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:51,479
Shado, along with Slade Wilson,

496
00:20:51,481 --> 00:20:54,498
<i>trained Oliver to fight.</i>

497
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,983
<i>She coached him in skills</i>

498
00:20:55,985 --> 00:20:57,852
<i>she had learned</i>
<i>from her father.</i>

499
00:20:57,854 --> 00:20:59,737
Showoff.

500
00:20:59,739 --> 00:21:01,722
(Man) Missile one locked
on the jet's heat trail.

501
00:21:01,724 --> 00:21:03,858
(Fyers) Prepare to launch
on my mark.

502
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:05,059
<i>When the island militia</i>

503
00:21:05,061 --> 00:21:07,161
<i>attempted to down</i>
<i>a commercial airliner...</i>

504
00:21:07,163 --> 00:21:09,080
We need to reprogram
the missile.

505
00:21:09,082 --> 00:21:11,248
<i>Oliver and his allies...</i>

(Missile whistling)

507
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,253
Let her go.

508
00:21:16,255 --> 00:21:17,905
<i>And when tested,</i>

509
00:21:17,907 --> 00:21:21,092
<i>Oliver put everything he had</i>
<i>learned from Slade and Shado</i>

510
00:21:21,094 --> 00:21:22,543
<i>into practice.</i>

511
00:21:22,545 --> 00:21:23,844
Uhh!

512
00:21:28,216 --> 00:21:29,934
I got your message.

513
00:21:29,936 --> 00:21:33,220
Is there a reason we can't
do this face-to-face?

514
00:21:37,059 --> 00:21:38,426
<i>Oliver, as the vigilante,</i>

515
00:21:38,428 --> 00:21:40,828
<i>began covertly helping</i>
<i>Laurel Lance</i>

<i>to defend people</i>
<i>the law couldn't protect.</i>

517
00:21:43,032 --> 00:21:44,231
What's in here?

518
00:21:44,233 --> 00:21:47,284
Leverage. Enough to help save
Peter Declan's life.

519
00:21:47,286 --> 00:21:51,155
As an attorney, I never would've
gotten a file like this.

520
00:21:51,157 --> 00:21:54,742
I always thought the law was
sacred. You fixed everything.

521
00:21:54,744 --> 00:21:56,210
Now what do you think?

522
00:21:56,212 --> 00:21:57,461
I think there's
too many people in this city

523
00:21:57,463 --> 00:21:59,279
who only care about
themselves.

524
00:21:59,281 --> 00:22:01,882
They need someone like you.

525
00:22:03,385 --> 00:22:04,835
<i>Her connection to the Hood</i>

526
00:22:04,837 --> 00:22:07,121
<i>complicated</i>
<i>Laurel's relationships</i>

527
00:22:07,123 --> 00:22:08,956
<i>with her father...</i>

528
00:22:08,958 --> 00:22:10,141
He's a damn criminal,
and you've worked with him.

529
00:22:10,143 --> 00:22:11,291
That makes you an accessory.

530
00:22:11,293 --> 00:22:13,594
I am trying to save
an innocent man's life.

531
00:22:14,896 --> 00:22:16,630
No.

532
00:22:16,632 --> 00:22:18,849
You're breaking the law.

533
00:22:18,851 --> 00:22:20,067
<i>And her boyfriend.</i>

534
00:22:20,069 --> 00:22:22,302
So you met up with
the hood guy? Knowingly?

535
00:22:22,304 --> 00:22:23,554
Laurel, he's a murderer.

536
00:22:23,556 --> 00:22:24,805
You sound like my father.

537
00:22:24,807 --> 00:22:26,907
Well, I hate to break it to you,
but he's right.

538
00:22:26,909 --> 00:22:29,193
She's been working with
the hood guy.

539
00:22:29,195 --> 00:22:33,981
And there's some sort of
infatuation thing going on here.

540
00:22:33,983 --> 00:22:36,050
I--
fix this.

541
00:22:36,052 --> 00:22:39,403
Before it becomes something
that's unfixable.

542
00:22:40,255 --> 00:22:42,757
<i>Oliver had trouble</i>
<i>being honest,</i>

543
00:22:42,759 --> 00:22:44,491
<i>but that didn't</i>
<i>stop Felicity...</i>

544
00:22:44,493 --> 00:22:46,477
Hi.
Hi.

545
00:22:46,479 --> 00:22:48,679
<i>From coming to him for help.</i>

546
00:22:48,681 --> 00:22:50,548
Can I trust you?

547
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:53,017
You've dropped some
fairly ridiculous lies on me,

548
00:22:53,019 --> 00:22:54,351
and...

549
00:22:54,353 --> 00:22:57,438
Yet I still feel like
I can trust you.

550
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,306
You can trust me.

551
00:23:01,109 --> 00:23:02,727
Then I have something
to show you.

552
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,734
Where'd you get it?

553
00:23:09,736 --> 00:23:12,536
From your stepfather.

554
00:23:12,538 --> 00:23:15,906
He said it belongs
to your mother.

555
00:23:17,476 --> 00:23:20,027
This is
your father's notebook.

556
00:23:20,029 --> 00:23:23,330
He kept a list of all the people
in Starling City

557
00:23:23,332 --> 00:23:24,582
who owed him favors.

558
00:23:24,584 --> 00:23:27,868
I've been researching some of
those names online,

559
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:30,755
and, uh,
they're not good people.

560
00:23:33,842 --> 00:23:37,544
The only way
to keep this family safe

561
00:23:37,546 --> 00:23:40,898
is for everyone in it
to stop asking questions,

562
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:43,317
including you, Oliver.

563
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:48,856
<i>But there were still</i>
<i>too many questions left to ask.</i>

564
00:23:48,858 --> 00:23:50,641
I made it clear to him
persuasively

565
00:23:50,643 --> 00:23:52,910
that his plans endanger
the undertaking.

566
00:23:52,912 --> 00:23:55,830
I didn't have to make
the usual threats.

567
00:23:55,832 --> 00:23:56,947
(Malcolm) Excellent.

568
00:23:56,949 --> 00:23:59,900
<i>Oliver was concerned</i>
<i>about his mother...</i>

569
00:23:59,902 --> 00:24:01,068
What's the Undertaking?

570
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:02,520
I don't know.

571
00:24:02,522 --> 00:24:05,405
But with all this talk
about threats, it can't be good.

572
00:24:05,407 --> 00:24:08,759
<i>And determined to find out</i>
<i>everything she knew.</i>

573
00:24:08,761 --> 00:24:10,127
What are you gonna do?

574
00:24:14,916 --> 00:24:16,083
(Gasps)

575
00:24:16,085 --> 00:24:17,885
Moira Queen,

576
00:24:17,887 --> 00:24:20,754
you have failed this city.

577
00:24:27,772 --> 00:24:29,540
Please don't kill me.

578
00:24:29,542 --> 00:24:31,976
Do you know anything
about the Undertaking?

579
00:24:31,978 --> 00:24:33,110
I am a mother.

580
00:24:33,112 --> 00:24:35,329
Please don't take me
from my children.

581
00:24:35,331 --> 00:24:38,466
<i>Oliver couldn't help</i>
<i>but show his mother mercy.</i>

582
00:24:38,468 --> 00:24:40,251
I'm not gonna hurt you.

583
00:24:43,589 --> 00:24:45,006
<i>He should've known better.</i>

584
00:24:45,008 --> 00:24:47,391
(Siren wailing in distance)

585
00:24:47,393 --> 00:24:48,809
<i>After he escaped...</i>
(Car alarm chirps)

586
00:24:48,811 --> 00:24:51,062
<i>He went to the one person</i>
<i>at Queen Consolidated</i>

587
00:24:51,064 --> 00:24:53,014
<i>he could trust.</i>
Whoa!

588
00:24:53,016 --> 00:24:54,765
(Strained voice) I'm not gonna
hurt you, Felicity.

589
00:24:54,767 --> 00:24:56,967
How do you know my name?
Because you know my name.

590
00:24:56,969 --> 00:24:59,820
Everything about you just became
so unbelievably clear.

591
00:24:59,822 --> 00:25:01,105
(Exhales)

592
00:25:01,107 --> 00:25:03,824
<i>The Starling City Vigilante</i>
<i>attacked Mrs. Queen...</i>

593
00:25:03,826 --> 00:25:05,809
(Felicity) Excuse me.

594
00:25:05,811 --> 00:25:08,246
Can you help me?
He's... really heavy.

595
00:25:09,281 --> 00:25:10,814
(Felicity) I should've
taken him to a hospital.

596
00:25:10,816 --> 00:25:13,150
Felicity, listen. Trust me.
He'll be fine.

597
00:25:13,152 --> 00:25:15,586
He's been through a lot worse
than this.

598
00:25:15,588 --> 00:25:17,838
<i>Once Oliver was stable,</i>

599
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,708
<i>Diggle and Felicity</i>
<i>addressed the obvious.</i>

600
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:23,094
I was thinking all this
would be more of a shock.

601
00:25:23,096 --> 00:25:25,129
Oliver brought me a laptop
riddled with bullet holes,

602
00:25:25,131 --> 00:25:26,964
had me trace the black arrow,

603
00:25:26,966 --> 00:25:30,301
and research a company involved
in armored car heists.

604
00:25:30,303 --> 00:25:32,520
I maybe blonde,
but I'm not <i>that</i> blonde.

605
00:25:32,522 --> 00:25:35,940
(Monitor beeping steadily)

606
00:25:35,942 --> 00:25:38,359
I guess I didn't die. Again.

607
00:25:39,394 --> 00:25:40,811
Cool.

608
00:25:40,813 --> 00:25:44,565
<i>Felicity was officially</i>
<i>part of the team.</i>

609
00:25:47,703 --> 00:25:51,656
<i>The Glades is a notoriously</i>
<i>rough side of Starling City...</i>

610
00:25:51,658 --> 00:25:53,040
Hey!

611
00:25:53,042 --> 00:25:56,544
<i>Known as a breeding ground</i>
<i>for all manner of criminal.</i>

612
00:25:57,696 --> 00:25:58,879
(Scoffs)

613
00:26:00,916 --> 00:26:02,500
(Thea) I found the dirtbag.

614
00:26:02,502 --> 00:26:04,252
His name is Roy Harper.

615
00:26:04,254 --> 00:26:05,403
(Knocks on door)

616
00:26:05,405 --> 00:26:06,971
(Roy) How'd you know
where I lived?

617
00:26:06,973 --> 00:26:08,639
A little thing called
the Internet.

618
00:26:08,641 --> 00:26:11,892
<i>Thea Queen was not</i>
<i>a cooperative victim.</i>

619
00:26:11,894 --> 00:26:13,844
You know, you showed
some real sac coming down here,

620
00:26:13,846 --> 00:26:15,112
the Glades in the middle
of the night...

621
00:26:15,114 --> 00:26:18,149
You must not know the value
of a vintage purse.

622
00:26:18,151 --> 00:26:20,434
Hey, can I give you
some advice?

623
00:26:20,436 --> 00:26:21,986
Stay out of the Glades.

624
00:26:21,988 --> 00:26:24,989
<i>As it turns out,</i>
<i>Roy's advice was sound.</i>

625
00:26:24,991 --> 00:26:26,107
Where's downtown at?

626
00:26:26,109 --> 00:26:27,224
I-I-I don't know.

627
00:26:27,226 --> 00:26:29,243
Maybe you can give us
some directions.

628
00:26:29,245 --> 00:26:31,061
Or better yet, some money.

629
00:26:36,234 --> 00:26:37,501
(Panting) Ow.

630
00:26:37,503 --> 00:26:39,420
You're bleeding!
Yeah, I know.

631
00:26:39,422 --> 00:26:40,671
That's what happens
when you get stabbed.

632
00:26:40,673 --> 00:26:43,741
(Man)
This could sting a little.

633
00:26:43,743 --> 00:26:45,909
Oh, don't tell me
a tough gangbanger like yourself

634
00:26:45,911 --> 00:26:47,712
is afraid of
a tiny little needle.

635
00:26:47,714 --> 00:26:50,181
Well, just think about
something else.

636
00:26:50,183 --> 00:26:51,682
Like what? (Inhales sharply)

637
00:26:54,436 --> 00:26:57,521
<i>Thea was charmed</i>
<i>by Roy's bravery...</i>

638
00:26:57,523 --> 00:26:59,056
(Roy)
I was waiting for this.

639
00:26:59,058 --> 00:27:01,025
Waiting for what?

640
00:27:01,027 --> 00:27:02,926
<i>But not by his life</i>
<i>as a petty crook.</i>

641
00:27:02,928 --> 00:27:04,895
This is home, sweet home
for me.

642
00:27:04,897 --> 00:27:06,096
You either starve
or you do things

643
00:27:06,098 --> 00:27:08,149
that mean you're lucky enough
to make it to 21.

644
00:27:08,151 --> 00:27:10,117
(Man) Roy Harper?
Yeah?

645
00:27:10,119 --> 00:27:11,602
Uhh!
Roy!

646
00:27:11,604 --> 00:27:13,821
<i>A deranged vigilante</i>
<i>called the Savior</i>

647
00:27:13,823 --> 00:27:16,157
<i>looked to make an example</i>
<i>of Roy.</i>

648
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:17,742
More on the story
out of the Glades.

649
00:27:17,744 --> 00:27:20,211
The kidnapper seems to have
another victim.

650
00:27:20,213 --> 00:27:22,630
You know him?
Uh, Roy. He's my friend. (Sniffles)

651
00:27:22,632 --> 00:27:26,550
I promise you
he's gonna be okay.

652
00:27:26,552 --> 00:27:27,835
Felicity, show me a map...
(Taps key)

653
00:27:27,837 --> 00:27:29,003
Of sites of the abductions

654
00:27:29,005 --> 00:27:30,755
and where we've seen the signal
so far. (Typing)

655
00:27:30,757 --> 00:27:32,590
<i>Diggle and Felicity traced</i>
<i>Savior's location</i>

656
00:27:32,592 --> 00:27:35,476
<i>to Starling City's</i>
<i>abandoned subway.</i>

657
00:27:37,796 --> 00:27:39,129
Don't do it!

658
00:27:41,266 --> 00:27:42,933
<i>After Oliver rescued him,</i>

659
00:27:42,935 --> 00:27:45,770
<i>Roy reconsidered</i>
<i>his life's purpose.</i>

660
00:27:45,772 --> 00:27:47,438
(Roy) I thought
I was gonna die.

661
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,607
But you didn't.
Yeah, because of him.

662
00:27:49,609 --> 00:27:52,443
I can't go back to the way
things were, Thea.

663
00:27:52,445 --> 00:27:55,312
I c-can't just go back
to being nothing.

664
00:27:55,314 --> 00:27:56,580
I can't explain it,

665
00:27:56,582 --> 00:27:59,983
but it feels like my life is
connected to his.

666
00:27:59,985 --> 00:28:03,788
<i>The incident provided clarity</i>
<i>for Oliver as well.</i>

667
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:04,988
I've seen that map before.

668
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:07,591
It's an old map of
a decommissioned subway line.

669
00:28:07,593 --> 00:28:09,877
It runs underneath the low-rent
district of the city.

670
00:28:09,879 --> 00:28:13,664
(Oliver) It was right in front
of our faces the entire time.

671
00:28:13,666 --> 00:28:16,100
My father, the other archer,
the Undertaking...

672
00:28:16,102 --> 00:28:19,670
Whatever the plan is, it's all
connected to the Glades.

673
00:28:20,806 --> 00:28:23,691
(Malcolm) The Undertaking,
which we set for ourselves,

674
00:28:23,693 --> 00:28:26,694
is only months from fruition.

675
00:28:26,696 --> 00:28:29,847
There's hope on the horizon
for everyone in Starling.

676
00:28:29,849 --> 00:28:31,031
(Chuckles)

677
00:28:31,033 --> 00:28:33,534
We won't fail this city.

678
00:28:33,536 --> 00:28:36,570
And I think I speak
for everyone here

679
00:28:36,572 --> 00:28:39,373
when I say we're all with you,
Malcolm.

680
00:28:39,375 --> 00:28:42,493
<i>But privately,</i>
<i>Moira had misgivings...</i>

681
00:28:42,495 --> 00:28:43,794
I wanna get out.

682
00:28:43,796 --> 00:28:47,965
That's, uh, a lot to confide
in me, Moira.

683
00:28:47,967 --> 00:28:49,366
<i>As did a colleague.</i>

684
00:28:49,368 --> 00:28:52,536
I've gone along with this
for as long as I can stomach.

685
00:28:52,538 --> 00:28:55,389
Frank Chen recommended you.

686
00:28:55,391 --> 00:28:57,591
He said you could help us
with our problem.

687
00:28:57,593 --> 00:28:59,710
How can we be of assistance?

688
00:28:59,712 --> 00:29:01,429
Malcolm Merlyn.

689
00:29:01,431 --> 00:29:04,064
I want you to kill him
for me.

690
00:29:04,066 --> 00:29:06,049
(Malcolm, amplified voice)
The true humanitarian

691
00:29:06,051 --> 00:29:09,353
in the Merlyn family
was my wife Rebecca.

692
00:29:09,355 --> 00:29:13,274
I like to think that if the man
who murdered her knew her,

693
00:29:13,276 --> 00:29:16,393
he would've helped her to
her car, made sure she was safe,

694
00:29:16,395 --> 00:29:19,530
instead of stealing her purse
and shooting her.

695
00:29:20,398 --> 00:29:23,083
(Beep, alarm blaring)

696
00:29:23,085 --> 00:29:25,419
(Smack) Ladies and gentlemen,
please exit calmly...

697
00:29:25,421 --> 00:29:28,122
<i>Malcolm Merlyn was not</i>
<i>an easy target.</i>

698
00:29:28,124 --> 00:29:29,507
Tommy.

699
00:29:30,759 --> 00:29:32,242
Come with me.

700
00:29:33,512 --> 00:29:36,246
<i>He would not go down</i>
<i>without a fight...</i>

701
00:29:37,632 --> 00:29:39,767
<i>A fact that took his son</i>
<i>by surprise.</i>

702
00:29:39,769 --> 00:29:41,685
Wait!

703
00:29:41,687 --> 00:29:43,053
Let's go!

704
00:29:43,055 --> 00:29:45,272
How did you know
how to do that?

705
00:29:45,274 --> 00:29:47,274
What?
Kill.

706
00:29:47,276 --> 00:29:50,561
(Explosion)

707
00:29:50,563 --> 00:29:52,763
(Rapid gunfire)

708
00:29:54,232 --> 00:29:55,366
Dad!

709
00:29:55,368 --> 00:29:57,535
(Gasping)

710
00:29:58,770 --> 00:30:00,604
<i>Oliver arrived in time.</i>

711
00:30:00,606 --> 00:30:01,739
Stay back.

712
00:30:01,741 --> 00:30:04,341
I'm not here to hurt you
or your father.

713
00:30:04,343 --> 00:30:05,743
I said stay back.

714
00:30:05,745 --> 00:30:07,077
If you don't let me
help you now,

715
00:30:07,079 --> 00:30:09,780
he's dead before
anybody gets here!

716
00:30:09,782 --> 00:30:12,416
Why should I trust you?!

717
00:30:12,418 --> 00:30:15,586
<i>But there was no time left</i>
<i>for secrets.</i>

718
00:30:18,557 --> 00:30:21,458
'Cause you always have.

719
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:23,794
Oliver.

720
00:30:30,201 --> 00:30:32,820
(Gasps and groans)

721
00:30:32,822 --> 00:30:35,539
Dad. Oh.
Take it easy.

722
00:30:35,541 --> 00:30:37,441
<i>Thanks to Oliver...</i>

723
00:30:37,443 --> 00:30:38,826
The Vigilante saved you.

724
00:30:38,828 --> 00:30:39,943
He did?

725
00:30:39,945 --> 00:30:42,529
<i>Malcolm Merlyn was alive.</i>

726
00:30:42,531 --> 00:30:45,082
<i>But thanking him wasn't</i>
<i>foremost in Tommy's mind.</i>

727
00:30:45,084 --> 00:30:46,550
I know you have
a lot of questions.

728
00:30:46,552 --> 00:30:48,886
Yeah.

729
00:30:48,888 --> 00:30:50,087
(Inhales deeply)

730
00:30:50,089 --> 00:30:52,906
Yeah, but for now,
just the one.

731
00:30:56,144 --> 00:30:59,129
Were you ever gonna
tell me?

732
00:30:59,131 --> 00:31:00,731
No.

733
00:31:00,733 --> 00:31:03,066
<i>Tommy's distrust of Oliver</i>

734
00:31:03,068 --> 00:31:05,102
quickly grew to include Laurel.

735
00:31:05,104 --> 00:31:06,687
When you first got home,

736
00:31:06,689 --> 00:31:09,773
I didn't think that you had
changed much.

737
00:31:09,775 --> 00:31:13,560
But you have, and...

738
00:31:13,562 --> 00:31:14,745
It's nice to see.

739
00:31:14,747 --> 00:31:16,947
(Whispers) Thank you.

740
00:31:19,117 --> 00:31:22,202
(Thunderclap)

741
00:31:22,204 --> 00:31:25,422
You still love her,
don't you?

742
00:31:25,424 --> 00:31:26,757
It doesn't matter how I feel,

743
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:30,911
because of what I do,
I could never be with her.

744
00:31:30,913 --> 00:31:32,763
So you don't have anything
to be afraid of.

745
00:31:32,765 --> 00:31:36,016
She is <i>never...</i>

746
00:31:36,018 --> 00:31:38,919
ever going to know
my secret.

747
00:31:38,921 --> 00:31:41,438
It doesn't matter.
She knows.

748
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,423
I know.

749
00:31:43,425 --> 00:31:48,745
But if she ever found out
who you really are...

750
00:31:48,747 --> 00:31:50,764
She would choose you.

751
00:31:50,766 --> 00:31:53,283
(Laurel whispering)
You can't be serious.

752
00:31:53,285 --> 00:31:54,818
I'm not sure that I'm ready
for the kind of commitment

753
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:55,953
that you're looking for.

754
00:31:55,955 --> 00:31:59,039
And I don't want to hurt you
in the long run, so--

755
00:31:59,041 --> 00:32:00,207
(voice breaks) You're lying.

756
00:32:00,209 --> 00:32:02,442
I am not a liar.

757
00:32:02,444 --> 00:32:05,679
If you've changed,
and I know that you've changed,

758
00:32:05,681 --> 00:32:07,113
you would never do this.

759
00:32:07,115 --> 00:32:08,298
Well, then I guess

760
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:10,220
I haven't changed as much
as we all thought then.

761
00:32:12,987 --> 00:32:14,054
<i>And Tommy's rejection...</i>

762
00:32:14,056 --> 00:32:16,139
Will you please
go talk to Tommy for me?

763
00:32:16,141 --> 00:32:18,976
<i>Produced</i>
<i>a self-fulfilling prophecy.</i>

764
00:32:18,978 --> 00:32:20,244
And say what?

765
00:32:20,246 --> 00:32:22,229
Say that
you and I are over,

766
00:32:22,231 --> 00:32:24,297
that you're not
still in love with me.

767
00:32:25,767 --> 00:32:28,385
I can't do that.

768
00:32:28,387 --> 00:32:30,320
Why not?

769
00:32:30,322 --> 00:32:34,157
Because it wouldn't be true.

770
00:32:48,456 --> 00:32:50,390
(Moira)
Thank you for coming, Frank.

771
00:32:50,392 --> 00:32:53,677
<i>Merlyn's survival forced Moira</i>
<i>to cover her tracks.</i>

772
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:54,828
Malcolm knows.

773
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:56,496
(Whispers) What?
I had no choice

774
00:32:56,498 --> 00:32:58,849
but to turn over what
they've discovered... (Exhales deeply)

775
00:32:58,851 --> 00:33:00,834
The money that you paid
the Triad to assassinate him.

776
00:33:00,836 --> 00:33:02,352
(Arrow whooshes) The money I--
(Inhales sharply)

777
00:33:02,354 --> 00:33:04,137
Moira!

778
00:33:05,172 --> 00:33:08,942
Mr. Merlyn thanks you
for your loyalty.

779
00:33:08,944 --> 00:33:11,778
<i>Moira's paranoia</i>
<i>began to boil over...</i>

780
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:12,863
(Sobs)

781
00:33:12,865 --> 00:33:15,866
You lied to me.
We had a deal!

782
00:33:15,868 --> 00:33:17,234
<i>And so did she.</i>

783
00:33:17,236 --> 00:33:19,703
You promised if I cooperated
with the Undertaking,

784
00:33:19,705 --> 00:33:20,871
Walter wouldn't be harmed!

785
00:33:20,873 --> 00:33:23,457
He hasn't been.
I'm a man of my word, Moira.

786
00:33:23,459 --> 00:33:25,158
I think we both know better
than that.

787
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,526
Turn on the camera.

788
00:33:29,714 --> 00:33:31,882
Oh, Walter.

789
00:33:31,884 --> 00:33:33,917
Like you said, Moira,
we have an agreement.

790
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:35,201
Walter would stay
in my custody

791
00:33:35,203 --> 00:33:38,672
until the Undertaking
was complete.

792
00:33:38,674 --> 00:33:40,240
We're both in this together.

793
00:33:40,242 --> 00:33:42,726
<i>And Oliver learned</i>
<i>the startling truth</i>

794
00:33:42,728 --> 00:33:44,044
<i>about his mother.</i>

795
00:33:44,046 --> 00:33:46,096
She's working with
Malcolm Merlyn.

796
00:33:48,215 --> 00:33:51,068
And they're
planning something.

797
00:33:52,487 --> 00:33:54,521
Something...

798
00:33:54,523 --> 00:33:56,189
Terrible.

799
00:34:03,817 --> 00:34:05,256
Hey, mom.

800
00:34:05,257 --> 00:34:07,040
<i>After uncovering</i>
<i>his mother's involvement</i>

801
00:34:07,042 --> 00:34:08,424
<i>with Merlyn's plot,</i>

802
00:34:08,426 --> 00:34:10,994
<i>Oliver confronted her</i>
<i>yet again.</i>

803
00:34:10,996 --> 00:34:12,445
Tell me the truth.

804
00:34:12,447 --> 00:34:13,579
I don't know what you mean.

805
00:34:13,581 --> 00:34:14,848
I think you do.

806
00:34:14,850 --> 00:34:16,850
Couple of months ago, when
I showed you Dad's notebook,

807
00:34:16,852 --> 00:34:18,584
you seemed to know
something.

808
00:34:18,586 --> 00:34:20,586
<i>When she continued</i>
<i>to be evasive...</i>

809
00:34:20,588 --> 00:34:22,789
You need to stop asking
these things.

810
00:34:22,791 --> 00:34:24,423
I <i>can't.</i>

811
00:34:24,425 --> 00:34:25,692
I <i>need</i> to know.
(Electricity powers down)

812
00:34:25,694 --> 00:34:27,727
<i>Oliver used</i>
<i>more drastic measures.</i>

813
00:34:27,729 --> 00:34:28,862
(Dart whooshes)

814
00:34:28,864 --> 00:34:30,563
Oh.

815
00:34:30,565 --> 00:34:31,648
Oliver.

816
00:34:31,650 --> 00:34:33,366
(Dart whooshes)
Ohh.

817
00:34:33,368 --> 00:34:35,652
(Breathes heavily)

818
00:34:36,487 --> 00:34:39,989
Moira Queen,
you have failed this city.

819
00:34:39,991 --> 00:34:42,992
Please, do not hurt my son.

820
00:34:42,994 --> 00:34:45,662
Tell me what the Undertaking is,
and I won't have to.

821
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:48,298
(Moira) No! (Gasps)

822
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:49,799
Uhh!
No!

823
00:34:49,801 --> 00:34:53,219
Malcolm is planning
to level the Glades!

824
00:34:53,221 --> 00:34:55,454
How?
There's a device.

825
00:34:55,456 --> 00:34:58,391
He says that it could cause
an earthquake.

826
00:34:58,393 --> 00:35:00,810
Why would you get involved
in something like this?

827
00:35:00,812 --> 00:35:02,395
My husband.

828
00:35:02,397 --> 00:35:05,298
He was lost. He...

829
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:08,301
His decisions left me
vulnerable to Malcolm.

830
00:35:08,303 --> 00:35:09,435
And I had no choice.

831
00:35:09,437 --> 00:35:12,355
I had to protect my family
and my children.

832
00:35:12,357 --> 00:35:14,440
This device, where is it?

833
00:35:14,442 --> 00:35:15,792
I don't know.

834
00:35:15,794 --> 00:35:17,544
If you don't tell me,
I can't stop Merlyn.

835
00:35:17,546 --> 00:35:19,028
Oh, you can't stop him.

836
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:20,530
It's too late.

837
00:35:20,532 --> 00:35:24,317
<i>Finally, Oliver understood</i>
<i>his true mission.</i>

838
00:35:24,319 --> 00:35:25,685
It's the Undertaking.

839
00:35:25,687 --> 00:35:29,539
I was just treating the symptoms
while the disease festered.

840
00:35:29,541 --> 00:35:33,793
I stop the Undertaking,
I wipe out the disease.

841
00:35:35,012 --> 00:35:38,414
Merlyn's plan is what I returned
from the island to stop.

842
00:35:41,552 --> 00:35:43,519
For the past five years,

843
00:35:43,521 --> 00:35:46,472
under the threat for my life
and the lives of my family...

844
00:35:46,474 --> 00:35:48,891
<i>Moira finally decided</i>
<i>to come clean.</i>

845
00:35:48,893 --> 00:35:50,393
I have been complicit

846
00:35:50,395 --> 00:35:53,196
in an undertaking
with one horrible purpose--

847
00:35:53,198 --> 00:35:56,532
to destroy the Glades
and everyone in it.

848
00:35:57,985 --> 00:36:02,688
The architect of this nightmare
<i>is Malcolm Merlyn.</i>

849
00:36:02,690 --> 00:36:04,857
(Screams)

850
00:36:04,859 --> 00:36:07,210
Yes, and I have proof
that he has killed dozens

851
00:36:07,212 --> 00:36:09,078
in pursuit of this madness.

852
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:12,498
Is it true?
Did you kill all those people?

853
00:36:14,001 --> 00:36:16,052
I did what I had to do.

854
00:36:17,371 --> 00:36:20,139
Malcolm Merlyn,
you are under arrest!

855
00:36:20,141 --> 00:36:21,374
Don't move!

856
00:36:23,761 --> 00:36:25,561
Dad, no!

857
00:36:28,232 --> 00:36:30,933
Stay back.
I don't wanna hurt you.

858
00:36:30,935 --> 00:36:33,319
You can't,

859
00:36:33,321 --> 00:36:35,554
and you can't stop me.

860
00:36:37,724 --> 00:36:38,941
This red line here

861
00:36:38,943 --> 00:36:41,227
is a known fault that runs
right below the Glades.

862
00:36:41,229 --> 00:36:42,662
For about a mile,
the fault runs underneath

863
00:36:42,664 --> 00:36:44,063
the old
10th Street subway line.

864
00:36:44,065 --> 00:36:45,198
Dollars to doughnuts,

865
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,233
the seismic device is
somewhere along there.

866
00:36:47,235 --> 00:36:48,734
(Cell phone chimes and buzzes)

867
00:36:48,736 --> 00:36:50,586
I know were Merlyn is
keeping the device.

868
00:36:50,588 --> 00:36:54,073
I need someone I can trust
to deactivate the device.

869
00:36:54,075 --> 00:36:55,375
(Sirens wailing)

870
00:36:55,377 --> 00:36:57,343

Moira Queen, C.E.O. of...

871
00:36:57,345 --> 00:37:01,798

<i>As Detective Lance searched</i>
<i>for the device...</i>

873
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:06,469
(Man on TV
speaking indistinctly)

874
00:37:06,471 --> 00:37:08,888
<i>Everyone prepared</i>
<i>for the worst.</i>

875
00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:10,256
(Man, amplified voice)
Proceed out of the Glades

876
00:37:10,258 --> 00:37:12,975
in an orderly manner.

877
00:37:12,977 --> 00:37:17,730
<i>Oliver and Diggle moved in</i>
<i>to take Merlyn down.</i>

878
00:37:17,732 --> 00:37:20,933
Welcome, gentlemen.
I've been waiting for you.

879
00:37:20,935 --> 00:37:23,769
I wanted to see you watch
your city die.

880
00:37:29,326 --> 00:37:30,877
Uhh! Aah!

881
00:37:30,879 --> 00:37:32,278
Aah!

882
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:35,832
(Beeping)
(Gasps)

883
00:37:35,834 --> 00:37:36,999
(Felicity)
You should see something

884
00:37:37,001 --> 00:37:38,634
that looks like a circuit board.
Okay.

885
00:37:38,636 --> 00:37:40,670
Felicity talked Detective Lance
<i>through disarming the weapon...</i>

886
00:37:40,672 --> 00:37:42,055
Do you see a timer?

887
00:37:42,057 --> 00:37:44,807
(Continues beeping)
7 minutes.

888
00:37:44,809 --> 00:37:45,958
Okay.

889
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:48,794
<i>While Oliver battled</i>
<i>to stop its damage.</i>

890
00:37:55,069 --> 00:37:56,819
Cut the blue one.
All right, I got it. I got it.

891
00:37:56,821 --> 00:37:57,937
(Snips)

892
00:37:57,939 --> 00:37:59,989
Oh!
(Whirring)

893
00:37:59,991 --> 00:38:01,157
(Beeping resumes)

894
00:38:01,159 --> 00:38:02,825
Holy God.

895
00:38:02,827 --> 00:38:05,027
(Tires screech)
Roy!

896
00:38:05,029 --> 00:38:06,496
Thea tracked down Roy Harper...

897
00:38:06,498 --> 00:38:09,248
Roy, stop! Look!
(People screaming at once)

898
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:11,918
The device is about to go off
any second!

899
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:14,587
<i>But she couldn't persuade him</i>
<i>to abandon his home.</i>

900
00:38:14,589 --> 00:38:15,922
I leave any of them behind.

901
00:38:15,924 --> 00:38:18,824
Look, I-I know you said
you have something to prove,

902
00:38:18,826 --> 00:38:20,659
but you're not the vigilante.

903
00:38:20,661 --> 00:38:22,545
I can't do this unless
I know you're safe.

904
00:38:22,547 --> 00:38:25,932
Then you better haul ass
out of here, too.

905
00:38:25,934 --> 00:38:28,101
With chaos erupting everywhere,

906
00:38:28,103 --> 00:38:32,188
<i>Oliver had one final chance to</i>
<i>prevent complete destruction.</i>

907
00:38:32,190 --> 00:38:35,057
Don't struggle.
It's over.

908
00:38:35,059 --> 00:38:36,526
Don't worry.

909
00:38:36,528 --> 00:38:39,195
Your mother and sister will
be joining you in death. (Groans)

910
00:38:40,397 --> 00:38:42,031
Aah!

911
00:38:42,033 --> 00:38:45,701
(Groaning)

912
00:38:45,703 --> 00:38:47,069
(Beeping continues)

913
00:38:47,071 --> 00:38:50,856
(Powers down)

914
00:38:50,858 --> 00:38:53,743
(Felicity)
Oliver, Lance did it.

915
00:38:53,745 --> 00:38:56,662
It's over.

916
00:38:56,664 --> 00:38:59,715
If I've learned anything
as a successful businessman,

917
00:38:59,717 --> 00:39:01,417
it's... (Exhales sharply)

918
00:39:01,419 --> 00:39:02,701
(Coughs)

919
00:39:02,703 --> 00:39:04,420
Redundancy.

920
00:39:04,422 --> 00:39:06,756
(Groans)

921
00:39:06,758 --> 00:39:10,009
(Electricity humming)
(Oliver) There's another device.

922
00:39:10,011 --> 00:39:12,061
There's two of them.

923
00:39:12,063 --> 00:39:14,230
(Explosion)

924
00:39:14,232 --> 00:39:17,767
Oliver Queen came back to right
<i>his father's wrongs.</i>

925
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:24,357
<i>He couldn't have imagined</i>
<i>how severe they were.</i>

926
00:39:25,159 --> 00:39:28,027
(Laurel) Go. Go!

927
00:39:28,029 --> 00:39:30,729
Uhh! Aah!

928
00:39:32,082 --> 00:39:33,249
<i>He returned to a city</i>

929
00:39:33,251 --> 00:39:35,952
<i>suffocated by corruption</i>
<i>and violence...</i>

930
00:39:35,954 --> 00:39:37,570
Laurel!

931
00:39:37,572 --> 00:39:38,737
The damage seems to be
contained

932
00:39:38,739 --> 00:39:41,207
on the east side.
Laurel.

933
00:39:41,209 --> 00:39:42,542
Go. Go, go, go.

934
00:39:42,544 --> 00:39:44,743
<i>And he fought</i>
<i>to make it better...</i>

935
00:39:44,745 --> 00:39:47,129
Please! Help me!

936
00:39:47,131 --> 00:39:50,850
<i>To make the people around him</i>
<i>better.</i>

937
00:39:50,852 --> 00:39:53,853
(Strained voice) Tommy.
What are you doing here?

938
00:39:53,855 --> 00:39:55,972
I love you.

939
00:39:57,224 --> 00:40:00,226
<i>True heroism is defined</i>
<i>by sacrifice...</i>

940
00:40:00,228 --> 00:40:02,645
(Grunts) Go! Go!
I'm right behind you!

941
00:40:02,647 --> 00:40:04,280
Dad!

942
00:40:04,282 --> 00:40:05,615
<i>And real heroes...</i>

943
00:40:05,617 --> 00:40:07,450
No!
No, Laurel!

944
00:40:08,402 --> 00:40:10,403
<i>Are the ones</i>
<i>who give up the most.</i>

945
00:40:10,405 --> 00:40:13,272
Come on. It's too late!
It's too late. (Sobbing)

946
00:40:15,792 --> 00:40:17,910
(Speaks indistinctly)

947
00:40:17,912 --> 00:40:19,078
Tommy.

948
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,913
(Whispering)
Is--is Laurel safe?

949
00:40:20,915 --> 00:40:22,215
Is Laurel safe?

950
00:40:22,217 --> 00:40:24,717
Yeah. You saved her.

951
00:40:24,719 --> 00:40:26,252
I'm--I'm sorry.

952
00:40:26,254 --> 00:40:28,254
(Voice breaks) No.

953
00:40:28,256 --> 00:40:30,089
Don't apologize.

954
00:40:31,592 --> 00:40:32,808
And--no.

955
00:40:34,394 --> 00:40:37,146
Tommy. (Crying)

956
00:40:37,148 --> 00:40:39,982
<i>After the tragedy</i>
<i>in the Glades,</i>

957
00:40:39,984 --> 00:40:40,983
<i>we must wonder...</i>

958
00:40:40,985 --> 00:40:42,568
(Whispers) Open your eyes.

959
00:40:42,570 --> 00:40:46,522
<i>What will Oliver Queen</i>
<i>become now?</i>

960
00:40:46,524 --> 00:40:50,326
<i>Something else yet again?</i>

961
00:40:50,328 --> 00:40:52,662
<i>Perhaps something...</i>

962
00:40:52,664 --> 00:40:54,196
<i>Better.</i>
