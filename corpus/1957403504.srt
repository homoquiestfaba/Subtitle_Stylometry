186
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:02,950
Signature mocktail?

187
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,230
Thank you.

188
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:06,450
A sorority lineup.
Wow.

189
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:08,640
Well, Riley is in legacy.

190
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:10,210
I was pi gamma beta.

191
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:12,960
Does that mean
you're in automatically?

192
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:14,790
It helps for sure, but,
you know,

193
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:16,890
I still have to go
through recruitment.

194
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:19,890
So step one, you apply to all
the houses you're interested in.

195
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:21,480
Step two, you attend events,

196
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:24,970
You know, try and be as
impressive as you possibly can.

197
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:27,160
If they really like you,
you're invited to step three,

198
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:30,750
Which is the bid.
Stressful.

199
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:33,830
Okay, so, really, you could
be invited to six houses

200
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,650
Or none at all?

201
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:38,430
Yeah, basically I've tried to
prepare for every eventuality.

202
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:40,410
Oh, I just remembered,
Rosa denude is here

203
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:42,320
And I'm a big fan of
their philanthropy work.

204
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:43,820
So, I'm gonna go.

205
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,750
- Okay.
- Okay.

206
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:45,990
I'll be back though, promise.

207
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:47,920
Sorority sister to surgeon.

208
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:50,590
That is impressive,
Dr. O'connor.

209
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:52,330
Well, I'm not really an anomaly.

210
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:54,330
I mean, let's look
at Kamala Harris, right,

211
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:55,930
All the way to
the vice presidency.

212
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:58,020
Touché, touché.

213
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:01,100
Some of the houses
are about parties but,

214
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:02,770
Most of them are filled

215
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:04,430
With very smart and ambitious
young women.

216
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:07,100
You would actually probably
fit right in.

217
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,440
Thank you. It's lovely
of you to say.

218
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:13,370
[phone vibrating]

219
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:14,950
Sorry, I should...

220
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,450
Yeah, no, go.

221
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:19,630
I'll just be over here,
reliving my youth.

222
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:24,790
Got it. Yes!

223
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:26,140
Olivia Rivera!

224
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:28,370
We were so hoping
you would show up.

225
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:29,290
Good news?

226
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:30,890
Yeah.

227
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:32,150
Sorry, do I know you?

228
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:35,130
Not yet, Olivia.
But I know you.

229
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:37,630
100,000 followers on insta.

230
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:40,210
The published expose
on your city Counsellor.

231
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:41,560
Cheating bastard.

232
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:44,230
And your Anders entrance essay
was phenomenal.

233
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:46,490
You have such a strong voice.

234
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:49,480
How in the hell did you read
my entrance essay?

235
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,890
Jasmine Foyle.

236
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,910
Current head of recruitment
for pi gamma beta.

237
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,590
Do you have a minute?

238
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,340
-Wow
-oh my.

239
00:10:58,570 --> 00:10:59,750
Katherine O’Connor?

240
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,420
Georgia.

241
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:04,420
Wow. I thought that you were
in new york, doing pr.

242
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:05,740
Can you believe?

243
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:07,910
I am the chapter advisor
here on campus.

244
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,520
It's like nothing's
ever changed.

245
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:10,910
This is Paige.

246
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:12,590
The pi gamma beta secretary.

247
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:13,600
Welcome.

248
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:14,500
Hi, this is my daughter-

249
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,100
Riley.

250
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,066
Daughter of famous Dr. O'connor
is not to be forgotten.

251
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:19,336
Katherine, how would
you like to bid

252
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,010
On some of our auction items?

253
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:24,850
We've got spa days, four courses
at my favorite restaurant,

254
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:25,940
All for charity.

255
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,040
Spa day for us?

256
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:28,260
Absolutely.

257
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:29,950
- Yeah, I got this.
- Thanks mom.

258
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,166
So Paige, how long have you
been a member of-

259
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:35,190
How crazy.

260
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:37,380
We have two legacies
and two science majors

261
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:38,710
In the same place.

262
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:42,720
Riley, you and Mya are basically
the same person.

263
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:44,460
Is that a good or a bad thing?

264
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:45,960
Well it depends.

265
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:48,060
Are you good at winning
competitions, or not?

266
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,120
Yeah.

267
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,650
- I'll just sign in now.
- Mmmhmm.

268
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:59,120
So, you want me to join?

269
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:01,900
I'm like the least likely
sorority girl ever.

270
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:04,130
Which makes you all
the more interesting.

271
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:06,150
Yeah, I feel like you're trying
to collect me.

272
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:07,910
We're very selective

273
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:10,650
About whom we invite into the pi
gamma beta family, Olivia.

274
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,730
We're known for our ambition.

275
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:15,580
We pick people who will
elevate the house.

276
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:17,080
Like you.

277
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:20,070
Yeah, I just came
with a friend, so.

278
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,160
Riley O’Connor.

279
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,930
Aw, I'm freaking you out.

280
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:27,320
Oh, first days on campus
can be overwhelming

281
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:29,340
And you didn't have anyone
to tell you

282
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:31,100
What to expect, did you?

283
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:32,660
No, how..

284
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,270
We'll let you get your feet
under you.

285
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,180
But please, consider it, Olivia.

286
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:40,270
We'd love to have someone of
your caliber in pi gamma beta.

287
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:46,950
<i>Olivia: She knew things
about me,</i>

288
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:49,930
Things I do not share
on social media.

289
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:53,620
And she kept saying my name
over and over and over.

290
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:56,370
There's a psychological trick.
It builds rapport.

291
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,960
It means she actually liked you.

292
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:01,700
From what I hear, this jasmine
has really brought like

293
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:04,130
Pi gamma beta back
to life again.

294
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:08,300
I mean, listen, check out
its alumnus.

295
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:13,530
- Okay, so, two congress women.
- Mmmhmm.

296
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:15,700
An editor of the new york times.

297
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:18,980
Woah, Woah, Woah, wait.
Jill Saunders?

298
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:21,300
The documentary filmmaker?

299
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:23,970
Yeah, we're friends.

300
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:27,380
Her first film made me want
to go into journalism.

301
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:30,320
Any chance you could make
an introduction?

302
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:31,950
Hmm.

303
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:38,150
Hell week is an opportunity.
Golden hour.

304
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:39,070
Let me dig in-

305
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:40,390
To what?

306
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:41,740
The row is locked down.

307
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:44,320
You won't get anything
but dating stats and gossip.

308
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:46,920
Hi, Jamie, I'm Olivia Rivera.
I've-

309
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:50,590
Got our coveted first year
assistant gig.

310
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:53,010
You don't start until next week.

311
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:54,410
I was wondering if I could run

312
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,500
Some potential story ideas
by you?

313
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,760
Assistants don't pitch or write.

314
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:01,250
Your job will be to proof
and fact check.

315
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:04,670
So I shouldn't pursue a possible
interview with Jill Saunders?

316
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:05,600
You set that up yourself?

317
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,270
Mm-hmm.

318
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,750
I like the initiative.

319
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:10,360
But if you'd done your homework,

320
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:14,020
You'd know we ran a story
with Jill last year.

321
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,280
<i>Jamie: We'll set you up with
access to our back issues,</i>

322
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:18,040
<i>Then we can talk more next week.</i>

323
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:19,270
<i>Cool?</i>

324
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:20,880
Yeah.

325
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,800
Hey, Olivia, hold on.

326
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:34,610
Are you gonna be a problem
for me, bookstore guy?

327
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:37,710
Are you going to be a problem
for you?

328
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,540
The Saunders interview
was on point.

329
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,970
You have great instincts.

330
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:43,640
Right. Were you in that room
just a moment ago?

331
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:48,220
Jamie will let you write if you
find something undeniable.

332
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:49,630
A story only you can write.

333
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,800
You want to write about
hell week.

334
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:53,796
There's some rumors I think
might be worth chasing.

335
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,630
What kind of rumors?

336
00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:58,580
Two years ago, paramedics showed
up to a house on sorority row,

337
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:01,920
Along with campus security,
and the police.

338
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:03,400
Which house?

339
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:05,490
Pi gamma beta.

340
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:07,830
Right. Of course.

341
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:09,740
Your friend's a legacy, huh?

342
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,500
What is she getting
herself into?

343
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:13,910
Halloween night.

344
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,966
<i>Nate: The story going was
the girl was badly injured</i>

345
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:17,930
<i>In some sort of accident
in the woods.</i>

346
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:20,976
<i>Apparently, dozens
of people were there,</i>

347
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,260
<i>But when the dust settled,
no one will talk.</i>

348
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:27,090
<i>In the end, the university
tried to pass it off</i>

349
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:29,760
<i>As a jogger injured herself.</i>

350
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:31,520
<i>Neither changed their story.</i>

351
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,510
How many joggers
run at midnight?

352
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,240
Through the woods, on Halloween?

353
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:41,100
We are going to talk
about something

354
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,460
Other than work after this.

355
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,520
Like, your family
or your school,

356
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:46,780
Or even your favorite color.

357
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,800

down from the city

public school

floor wax and gym socks.

1426
01:11:48,970 --> 01:11:52,730
<i>Remove that blinder
and it's all over, bitch.</i>

1427
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:56,230
<i>Go ahead, we don't want
your brand anyway.</i>

1428
01:11:56,390 --> 01:11:57,390
<i>Quitter.</i>

1429
01:12:11,680 --> 01:12:13,340
[screams]
ahhhh!!!!!

1430
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:26,860
<i>Dahlia: She broke her leg.</i>

1431
01:12:27,010 --> 01:12:28,170
Dahlia called an ambulance

1432
01:12:28,190 --> 01:12:30,030
But jasmine lied about
how she did it.

1433
01:12:30,180 --> 01:12:31,510
I was ready to confess
everything.

1434
01:12:31,530 --> 01:12:33,770
So she buried her own hazing?

1435
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:38,110
She said "I shouldn't make
the house pay for my mistake."

1436
01:12:38,200 --> 01:12:41,190
Always protect the family, but
she threw you under the bus.

1437
01:12:41,210 --> 01:12:43,450
She made it look like
it was just me.

1438
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:46,040
That I bullied her
because she was my sister.

1439
01:12:46,270 --> 01:12:48,600
Pgb sent tau alpha
to intimidate you.

1440
01:12:48,620 --> 01:12:51,270
You were one of the dudes
in the hoodies?

1441
01:12:51,290 --> 01:12:53,460
I'm sorry.

1442
01:12:53,550 --> 01:12:55,510
Gabriel has a full ride
on a football scholarship.

1443
01:12:55,610 --> 01:12:57,890
No one is gonna know
that we spoke.

1444
01:13:00,380 --> 01:13:03,020
Olivia is very good at
protecting her sources.

1445
01:13:04,730 --> 01:13:09,070
And thank you, for doing right
by Riley and me.

1446
01:13:19,730 --> 01:13:20,776
Let's get you out of here, now.

1447
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:21,580
Definitely.

1448
01:13:21,810 --> 01:13:22,560
I'll be two minutes.

1449
01:13:22,580 --> 01:13:23,580
Cool.

1450
01:13:30,310 --> 01:13:31,310
Hey!

1451
01:13:33,820 --> 01:13:34,410
<i>Logan: We got her.</i>

1452
01:13:34,500 --> 01:13:35,930
<i>Get rid of Nate!</i>

1453
01:13:37,320 --> 01:13:38,430
<i>Pull over!</i>

1454
01:13:45,270 --> 01:13:47,190
- Come on! Come on!!
- Hey!

1455
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:48,850
What are you doing, man?

1456
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:50,680
This isn't part of the plan.

1457
01:13:50,780 --> 01:13:52,330
You've been digging around
in pi gamma beta business

1458
01:13:52,350 --> 01:13:53,610
That isn't yours.

1459
01:13:54,840 --> 01:13:56,190
Ah!

1460
01:13:56,280 --> 01:13:57,596
Logan, I don't even need
to see you to know it's you.

1461
01:13:57,620 --> 01:13:58,930
You are such a lapdog.

1462
01:13:59,030 --> 01:14:00,450
<i>Logan: Shut up!</i>

1463
01:14:00,680 --> 01:14:01,120
I'm talking.

1464
01:14:01,270 --> 01:14:02,180
Tell slowly!

1465
01:14:02,270 --> 01:14:03,440
What, was I getting too close?

1466
01:14:03,460 --> 01:14:05,460
Maybe you're more involved
than I thought.

1467
01:14:05,680 --> 01:14:07,920
All we were supposed to do
is scare you.

1468
01:14:12,610 --> 01:14:14,590
I think you deserve
a little more.

1469
01:14:19,030 --> 01:14:20,450
Ahh!

1470
01:14:20,470 --> 01:14:21,700
- Come on, come on!
- Bitch!

1471
01:14:21,720 --> 01:14:22,470
Let's go.

1472
01:14:22,700 --> 01:14:23,380
Let's go.

1473
01:14:23,530 --> 01:14:24,370
Go, go, go.

1474
01:14:24,380 --> 01:14:25,810
Get in the van!

1475
01:14:29,820 --> 01:14:31,610
Have a nice walk!

1476
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:33,880
Ahh!

1477
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:36,320
<i>Come on.</i>

1478
01:15:28,280 --> 01:15:29,540
<i>Katherine: There she is.</i>

1479
01:15:33,710 --> 01:15:34,620
Help.

1480
01:15:34,710 --> 01:15:37,030
Olivia, oh my god.

1481
01:15:37,050 --> 01:15:38,120
Are you okay?

1482
01:15:38,280 --> 01:15:39,780
Is anything broken?

1483
01:15:39,870 --> 01:15:40,870
[coughs]
nothing's broken.

1484
01:15:43,200 --> 01:15:44,700
How'd you find me?

1485
01:15:44,720 --> 01:15:46,220
Gabriel texted.

1486
01:15:46,370 --> 01:15:48,490
He said that you'd been dumped
and abandoned out here.

1487
01:15:48,540 --> 01:15:49,880
Okay, this is, this is it.

1488
01:15:49,970 --> 01:15:51,120
We're handing it over
to the police.

1489
01:15:51,140 --> 01:15:52,300
No, no, no. No.

1490
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:53,140
Olivia!

1491
01:15:53,290 --> 01:15:54,310
You're in real danger.

1492
01:15:54,460 --> 01:15:56,880
Actual bodily harm
got sustained.

1493
01:15:56,980 --> 01:15:59,240
They did everything
I needed them to.

1494
01:15:59,390 --> 01:16:01,650
Now I know pi gamma beta
is scared

1495
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:04,300
And when you're scared,
you make mistakes.

1496
01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:06,080
They just made a big one.

1497
01:16:11,480 --> 01:16:12,750
We'll talk about this.

1498
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:21,840
<i>Jasmine: Paige, you back?</i>

1499
01:16:23,580 --> 01:16:25,910
I think they're all out
at the movies.

1500
01:16:25,930 --> 01:16:27,670
Just me.

1501
01:16:27,770 --> 01:16:30,340
What are you doing, sitting
here in the dark like a freak?

1502
01:16:30,440 --> 01:16:32,590
I was taking a breather.

1503
01:16:32,610 --> 01:16:35,010
Recovering from that one time
when I was abducted.

1504
01:16:35,170 --> 01:16:36,770
Tossed out of a van.

1505
01:16:36,930 --> 01:16:40,350
Oh my god, Olivia,
what happened?

1506
01:16:40,500 --> 01:16:43,280
I know about dahlia.

1507
01:16:43,430 --> 01:16:46,840
She was your own sister
and you used her mistake,

1508
01:16:46,940 --> 01:16:49,940
A hazing gone wrong,
a broken leg,

1509
01:16:50,030 --> 01:16:51,460
To get her kicked out
of the house.

1510
01:16:51,610 --> 01:16:53,110
Dahlia was stupid.

1511
01:16:53,130 --> 01:16:54,290
She panicked.

1512
01:16:54,520 --> 01:16:55,960
Called an ambulance.

1513
01:16:56,110 --> 01:16:57,870
I saved the house
by covering up,

1514
01:16:58,020 --> 01:17:00,300
Which is what she should
have done.

1515
01:17:00,450 --> 01:17:02,870
And now you're
covering up again.

1516
01:17:02,970 --> 01:17:05,190
Riley did not go up
that wall by herself.

1517
01:17:05,290 --> 01:17:08,210
Honey, we will never know
exactly what happened.

1518
01:17:08,370 --> 01:17:11,310
Because, you'll never tell.

1519
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:15,100
Except your boy Logan,
he's not as smart as you.

1520
01:17:17,060 --> 01:17:18,720
[clears throat]

1521
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:21,320
<i>You've been digging around
in pi gamma beta business</i>

1522
01:17:21,550 --> 01:17:22,820
<i>That isn't yours.</i>

1523
01:17:24,050 --> 01:17:25,490
Aw.

1524
01:17:25,640 --> 01:17:27,970
And I also gave him a good
raking with my nails.

1525
01:17:27,990 --> 01:17:30,400
Police will have no trouble
identifying him.

1526
01:17:30,550 --> 01:17:33,220
Exactly what do you want,
Olivia?

1527
01:17:33,310 --> 01:17:35,070
The truth.

1528
01:17:35,170 --> 01:17:39,340
Or, I post all of that,
a 100,000 followers

1529
01:17:39,560 --> 01:17:43,340
Are gonna know that
your boyfriend is a psycho.

1530
01:17:46,010 --> 01:17:47,010
Okay.

1531
01:17:48,070 --> 01:17:49,470
Okay.

1532
01:17:51,930 --> 01:17:55,240
Riley came back from putting
you to bed

1533
01:17:55,340 --> 01:17:58,930
Then Mya and Riley played
some truth or dare game.

1534
01:17:59,080 --> 01:18:01,100
Mya messed with Riley's head

1535
01:18:01,190 --> 01:18:02,950
And got Riley to admit
to being mentally ill.

1536
01:18:03,030 --> 01:18:04,420
Liar.

1537
01:18:04,440 --> 01:18:06,600
Riley was fragile, Olivia.

1538
01:18:06,760 --> 01:18:08,180
She took her own life, okay,

1539
01:18:08,280 --> 01:18:10,110
Just because you
don't like that,

1540
01:18:10,260 --> 01:18:11,430
It doesn't mean
it didn't happen.

1541
01:18:11,450 --> 01:18:14,430
Mya had broken fingers,
torn tendons,

1542
01:18:14,450 --> 01:18:16,280
Injuries suffered by climbers
all the time.

1543
01:18:16,430 --> 01:18:19,450
She went up that wall too,
jasmine.

1544
01:18:19,550 --> 01:18:22,210
Oh god.

1545
01:18:22,440 --> 01:18:23,550
It was an accident.

1546
01:18:23,700 --> 01:18:24,880
An accident?

1547
01:18:25,110 --> 01:18:26,880
Paige egged them on.

1548
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:29,110
And they were drunk and tired.

1549
01:18:29,200 --> 01:18:31,630
Mya made it up and down again.

1550
01:18:31,720 --> 01:18:33,280
Riley didn't.

1551
01:18:33,370 --> 01:18:35,230
So Paige made it look like
a suicide

1552
01:18:35,380 --> 01:18:38,880
And by the time I found out
about it, it was too late.

1553
01:18:38,900 --> 01:18:42,050
Olivia, I am so sorry.

1554
01:18:42,070 --> 01:18:43,360
Bitch.

1555
01:18:45,550 --> 01:18:48,800
You're not the only one who can
pit people against each other.

1556
01:18:49,720 --> 01:18:53,560
Paige, uh, how long have
you been there?

1557
01:18:53,580 --> 01:18:57,230
Long enough to hear
you stab me in the back.

1558
01:18:57,250 --> 01:18:59,040
If you won't tell the whole
truth, I will.

1559
01:19:06,480 --> 01:19:07,670
I put them up to it.

1560
01:19:07,820 --> 01:19:09,430
I challenged Mya to climb
all the way up.

1561
01:19:09,580 --> 01:19:13,170
I've climbed it before, I just,
I don't like heights.

1562
01:19:13,270 --> 01:19:15,170
You're scared.

1563
01:19:15,330 --> 01:19:17,680
Riley knows all about that.

1564
01:19:17,770 --> 01:19:19,920
Referring to my anxiety?

1565
01:19:19,940 --> 01:19:23,330
Calling it scared is inaccurate,
and frankly ignorant.

1566
01:19:23,350 --> 01:19:25,170
Careful, Riley, we might
start to think

1567
01:19:25,190 --> 01:19:26,850
That you have a back bone.

1568
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,260
You have no rope,
and you've been drinking.

1569
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:31,360
Do not get up that wall.

1570
01:19:31,450 --> 01:19:32,620
Please.

1571
01:19:32,770 --> 01:19:34,096
Don't you want to overcome
your fears?

1572
01:19:34,120 --> 01:19:35,940
There's a big difference
between overcoming her fears

1573
01:19:35,950 --> 01:19:38,530
And doing something
completely stupid and unsafe.

1574
01:19:38,620 --> 01:19:41,870
Mya? Mya.

1575
01:19:41,960 --> 01:19:45,460
You go up that wall or
you're out of the house.

1576
01:19:45,690 --> 01:19:47,460
You know what, Riley
can do it with you.

1577
01:19:47,690 --> 01:19:49,470
She clearly knows
what she's talking about.

1578
01:19:49,620 --> 01:19:50,970
Good idea.

1579
01:19:53,860 --> 01:19:54,890
No.

1580
01:19:56,140 --> 01:19:57,140
<i>Riley: Don't.</i>

1581
01:19:58,540 --> 01:20:00,770
<i>Paige: Aww. Whaa!</i>

1582
01:20:02,300 --> 01:20:03,310
Mya, stop!

1583
01:20:03,460 --> 01:20:04,480
Good girl!

1584
01:20:04,630 --> 01:20:05,630
[laughing]

1585
01:20:16,550 --> 01:20:17,830
There's one right there.

1586
01:20:24,150 --> 01:20:25,730
[screaming]
ah!!! Ah!!!

1587
01:20:25,820 --> 01:20:27,170
[jasmine & Paige laughing]

1588
01:20:29,340 --> 01:20:30,580
Come on, Mya!

1589
01:20:30,680 --> 01:20:33,260
Always forward, always up!

1590
01:20:35,260 --> 01:20:37,500
Look, you know what,
find your footing.

1591
01:20:37,590 --> 01:20:38,656
There's a hold right there.

1592
01:20:38,680 --> 01:20:40,020
I can't move.

1593
01:20:40,240 --> 01:20:41,350
I'm hurt, my wrist.

1594
01:20:41,500 --> 01:20:43,600
Oh, don't be a little bitch,
Mya.

1595
01:20:43,750 --> 01:20:45,630
You have to climb,
you're almost all the way up.

1596
01:20:45,690 --> 01:20:46,580
Shut up, okay!

1597
01:20:46,600 --> 01:20:47,690
She's frozen, she's done.

1598
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:48,670
Look at her!

1599
01:20:48,770 --> 01:20:50,010
