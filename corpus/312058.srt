1
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,474
It's making for the village.

2
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,116
Ifwe're quick
we can head the bugger off.

3
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,950
It doesn't seem fair.
All those hounds and just one fox.

4
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,429
It's not meant to be fair.
Come on, or we'll lose them.

5
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,556
The doctor said
you weren't to exert yourself.

6
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,950
-Are you a student of medicine?
-No, Your Grace. I'm a chauffeur.

7
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:51,476
-Then let's stick to what we know.
-Perhaps you should let me drive.

8
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,676
He's right, Grandpa. The doctor said...

9
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:58,231
Fresh air and light exercise. That was
the doctor's advice, and I'm taking it.

10
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,113
Come on, William.

11
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,196
Doesn't this thing go any faster?

12
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,316
That's my girl. Hang on!

13
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,193
What's going on?

14
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,959
Come on, Pomfert! Mushroom!
Hey, come on!

15
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,197
Would you mind controlling
these animals, Sarah Carraclough?

16
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,669
It might help us all
if you'd mind your own...

17
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,273
Edward Hynes.

18
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,112
Come on, Lass.

19
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,316
Urgh!

20
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,470
Who threw this? Eh?

21
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,158
Who threw this?

22
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,993
I'll have the police on you.
Do you hear me? I'll have the police!

23
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,991
Ruddy rabble!
Come on, Pomfert. Out of it!

24
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:16,949
The er...the pack are in a bit of a tangle.
I'm just getting it sorted, Your Grace.

25
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:21,158
Never mind the hounds. Did anyone see
which way the damn fox went?

26
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,879
-Towards the mine, they say.
-What are you waiting for?

27
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,474
-Well, I...
-This is a fox hunt, isn't it?

28
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,557
Yes, Your Grace.

29
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:32,074
A fox hunt. Right.

30
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,831
Come on, open this gate!

31
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,878
Eh? Come on, you lazy swine!
Open this gate.

32
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,996
All right. Come on, boys! Come on!

33
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,798
Come on!

34
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,957
Your Grace, you can't come through.

35
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,918
It's impossible.
There are men working down there.

36
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,274
They may be down there,

37
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,233
but they're not working -
we both know the seam's exhausted.

38
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,197
Now get out of the way!

39
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,235
There's still coal down there,
I'm sure of it.

40
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,670
What the bloody hell was that?

41
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,115
-A fox, I reckon.
-What's it doing down here?

42
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,033
Sssh! Listen up!

43
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,631
So...

44
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,234
are we going to let them catch it?

45
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,197
How can we stop them?

46
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,480
It's just a matter of
putting them off the scent.

47
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:42,120
-Don't you think?
-You daft bugger!

48
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,877
Right...

49
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,951
Let's see what they make of that, then.

50
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:13,716
..goes 7, remainder 4.

51
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,030
Which gives us 8 into 40.

52
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,673
Anybody?

53
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,796
Joe Carraclough?

54
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,472
Yes, miss?

55
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,596
What did I just ask?

56
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,989
A question, miss.

57
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,479
Stand up.

58
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,477
And what question was that?

59
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,757
Don't try and get the answer
from somebody else!

60
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,398
Well?

61
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,552
Didn't hear, miss.

62
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,119
Come here.

63
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,552
Left. Up!

64
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,034
Right.

65
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,951
Three more for answering back.

66
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,871
But, miss, I didn't.

67
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,791
Are you asking for another three?

68
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,757
No, miss.

69
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,195
Back.

70
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,238
Now...8 into 40.

71
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,399
Quickly, anybody.

72
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,118
Yes?

73
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,432
Ooh, is it time, Lass?

74
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:42,991
I don't understand. If they don't want to
eat it, why do they want to catch it?

75
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:46,152
Sport, my dear. For the sport.
They love it.

76
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,437
They don't look very happy.

77
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,478
They don't like to lose. Neither do I.

78
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,637
-She does.
-What?

79
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,078
Look happy.

80
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,794
She's beautiful, isn't she?

81
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,757
You've got a good eye.

82
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,757
You've got my good eye.

83
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,273
Hynes.

84
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,712
Hynes!

85
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,636
Let's see ifwe can't catch something today.

86
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,435
It's all right, Lass.

87
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,875
They're not hurting so much now.

88
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,072
Come on.

89
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,037
Let's go home.

90
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,593
Snap!
Blast!

91
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:08,753
You're not concentrating.
You can't play Snap if you don't concentrate.

92
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,153
I suppose it's dull for you here.

93
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,157
After the excitement of London.

94
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:17,752
Daddy says London isn't safe
because there's going to be a war.

95
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,034
Nonsense!

96
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,509
Snap!
Now we'll see who's concentrating.

97
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,839
Daddy says
everybody has their heads in the sand.

98
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,195
-Are you contradicting me?
-Yes, Grandpa.

99
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,748
You dare say yes,
you impertinent little scallywag.

100
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,513
If I said no,
that would be another contradiction.

101
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,272
Snap!

102
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,952
That's a draw so they go into the pool.

103
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,519
What do you mean?

104
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,795
We both said "snap" together
so that's a draw.

105
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,633
Now if you get a 7, you have to say
"snap pool" instead of "snap".

106
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,476
Who invented this idiotic game?

107
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,790
You did.

108
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,516
Skipper.

109
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,669
Bo'sun.

110
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,710
Well?

111
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,559
-He wouldn't sell, Your Grace.
-What do you mean?

112
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,278
How far did you go?

113
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,952
15.

114
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,632
He wouldn't sell for 15 pounds?

115
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,711
Carraclough said
the dog wasn't his to sell.

116
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,268
Probably stole the damn thing
in the first place.

117
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,759
Well, we'll see about that.

118
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,751
Snap!

119
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:18,718
Thought I wasn't looking, didn't you?
My win, I think.

120
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,638
We don't need his money.

121
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,518
Not today, perhaps.
But for how much longer?

122
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:32,479
Three hundredweight we brought up today.
And we worked a double shift.

123
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:35,993
The seam's dead. Everybody knows it.

124
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,758
They'll find another seam.

125
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:42,673
You can't find something
you're not looking for.

126
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,228
And no-one's looking. Not any more.

127
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,275
Come on, Lass.

128
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,590
You know you're not supposed to be up here.

129
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,718
Good night.

130
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,550
Mam?

131
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,429
Joe.

132
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:13,717
-What did that man want?
-Nothing to bother yourself with.

133
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,631
Now, come on. Go to sleep.

134
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,518
Dad wouldn't sell her, though, would he?

135
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,428
Those big ears are going to get you
into trouble one day.

136
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,829
But he can't! Lassie's mY dog.

137
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,672
She's our dog.

138
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,034
And we're not selling.

139
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,712
Love you.

140
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,871
-I want eight men round the back.
-Yes, sir.

141
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,238
Give me a straight line for the gate.

142
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,148
Sarah, quick. Get your coat.

143
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,390
-Is someone hurt?
-It's worse than that.

144
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,637
Well, what's this, John Fordham?

145
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,510
Are we not to be allowed in
to see our men?

146
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,875
You'll soon be complaining
you see too much of them.

147
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,234
Here they come. Look.

148
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,919
Come on. Get back.

149
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,399
Back, please.

150
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,913
Come on. Move back.

151
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,394
What is it? What's happening, Ma?

152
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:04,916
Closing the mine down, Joe.
They say there's not enough coal.

153
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,038
What's the matter? Does he not see us?

154
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,517
No, he sees us, Joe. He sees us.

155
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,959
Come on.

156
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,712
Thank you, Patterson.

157
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,232
Daisy, my dear.

158
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,514
You look exhausted.

159
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,273
Charlie sends his love.
His commission just came through.

160
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,511
He's had to report to some barracks
in the middle of nowhere. Where is she?

161
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,589
Just gone upstairs.

162
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,477
-Oh, do you mind if I...?
-Of course not.

163
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,790
I didn't tell her you were coming.
Just in case.

164
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,348
Nothing arrives on time these days.

165
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,910
Why couldn't Daddy come?

166
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,833
Because he's a soldier now, darling.
He has to do what he's told.

167
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,150
Grandpa says
there isn't going to be a war.

168
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,800
He says
everybody's just playing silly games.

169
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:19,429
Well, let's hope he's right.
Hop into bed and I'll read you a story.

170
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,437
Oh, I've missed you so much.

171
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,192
Why don't you take me back with you?

172
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,475
I can't.

173
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:36,314
Not yet, anyway. I don't know
where Daddy's going to be posted.

174
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,958
It's all very last-minute.

175
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,110
They nearly wouldn't let him join up at all.

176
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,077
I wish they hadn't.

177
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:45,275
I know, my darling. So do I.

178
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,193
It's not just me.
There's others talking the same.

179
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,714
What good will it do us
if you get yourself killed?

180
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,631
What else am I supposed to think of?

181
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,950
I walked my feet off for 20 miles
in every direction.

182
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,600
There's nothing in the whole county.

183
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,478
Lass. Lassie!

184
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:05,197
We can't. I know we can't.
It's not fair on the boy.

185
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,953
Keep your voice down.
I don't want him woken.

186
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,508
It's not fair on you.
It's not fair on any of us.

187
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,751
But we have rent to pay.
Mr Grimes won't keep us on't slate for ever.

188
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:16,035
And how am I expected
to put food on't table?

189
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,439
We'll find a way.

190
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,869
There's a Mr Carraclough at the door,
Your Grace.

191
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:33,475
-Shall I send him away?
-No. No. I was expecting him.

192
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,437
I'll see him in the study.

193
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,837
Do you have to go today?

194
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:47,036
Yes, darling. I'm sorry.

195
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,350
But I'll be back
as soon as Daddy's settled.

196
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,953
We have to find you a new school.

197
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,270
Why can't I stay at my old school?

198
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,033
Because, darling, London's not safe.

199
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,155
I'm sure we'll find you somewhere nice.

200
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,679
Be brave, darling.
I'll be back before you know it.

201
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,839
Hm?

202
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:29,633
Say hello to Charles for me. Tell him
I still think he's a blithering idiot.

203
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,597
I'll tell him.

204
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,272
Look after her for me.

205
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,237
Don't worry about us.

206
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,229
Young lady.

207
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:10,357
I've got something to show you.
Someone, I should say.

208
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,196
Where's Lassie? She wasn't at school.

209
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,271
I think something's happened to her.

210
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,635
Have you seen her?

211
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,797
Someone has to tell him.

212
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,991
Isn't she something?

213
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,355
I thought you said
they wanted to keep her.

214
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,431
They changed their mind, didn't they?

215
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:49,911
Couldn't get rid of her fast enough
once the subject of money was mentioned.

216
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,878
-She doesn't look very happy about it.
-Nonsense.

217
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,431
Where is that dratted fellow hiding?

218
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,875
-Hynes!
-Just coming.

219
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,188
Yes, sir.

220
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,077
What's the matter with this dog?

221
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,832
Erm... Matter, Your Grace?

222
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,319
Look at her, man.

223
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,391
Well...you mean her not taking her food?

224
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:12,199
Used to table scraps and all sorts,
I should say.

225
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:15,272
They've no idea how to handle dogs
down in that village.

226
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:18,634
Don't you worry
your pretty little head about it, miss.

227
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,995
I'll have her eating kennel-style
in a day or so.

228
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22,798
What's her name?

229
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,235
They never bothered to give her one.

230
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:26,753
Called her Lass. Or Lassie.

231
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:29,149
It just means girl.

232
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,117
No feeling for animals, in my experience.

233
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,994
Don't worry.
We'll give her a proper name.

234
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,830
I like the one she's got. Lassie.

235
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,150
See?

236
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,435
She knows it's her.

237
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:45,159
Come on.
You can come back and see her later.

238
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,435
Why can't we take her
up to the house with us?

239
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,317
When she's settled.

240
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,277
Let her get used to us first.

241
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:59,312
I'll see you eat. If I have to push
your bloody food down your throat.

242
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:03,358
Yeah, that's right.
Take a good look at me.

243
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,991
I'm in charge now.

244
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,117
Good boy.

245
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,477
Thanks, Peters.

246
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:31,155
Lassie, I've got to have a bath before tea,
but I'll be back straight after. I promise.

247
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,073
5 sevens are 35.

248
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,072
6 sevens are 42.

249
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,196
7 sevens are 49.

250
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,714
8 sevens are 56.

251
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,995
9 sevens are 63.

252
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,797
Lassie!

253
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,117
Lassie.

254
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,231
How did you get here?

255
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,197
Come on. I'll take you home.

256
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,557
Get in there!

257
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:47,113
I don't want any more of your tricks.
Do you understand?

258
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,112
You can't blame the boy.
You can't look after your own property.

259
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:53,272
You've no cause to talk to me like that,
Sam Carraclough.

260
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,510
I know you've trained it to run.

261
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,591
It won't happen again. Make no mistake.

262
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,718
Will you get them out of the way!

263
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,992
Come on! Oi!

264
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,709
Oi!

265
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,392
Somebody stop her!

266
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,072
What's going on here?

267
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,196
It's your dog. She ran away again.

268
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,356
-Again?
-I'll deal with this, Your Grace.

269
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,556
I brought my lad with me.
To pen her up this time.

270
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:58,108
-This'll be the last time.
It had better be.

271
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,994
Cilla.

272
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,752
Coming, Grandpa.

273
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,717
Let the boy do it.

274
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,677
It's him she runs for.

275
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,548
Go on, lad.

276
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,517
Get it over with.

277
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,113
Stay here and bide happy, Lass.

278
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,111
And don't come home no more.

279
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:34,119
You're a bad dog
and we don't love you no more.

280
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,674
So stay here and leave us be.

281
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:42,269
You understand?

282
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,237
Bad dog.

283
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,356
She isn't happy here.

284
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,635
-That's why she runs.
-Course she's happy.

285
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,915
She runs
because they've trained her to do it.

286
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,958
Then they can steal her back
and sell her to somebody else.

287
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:15,999
Bloody Yorkshiremen.
They're nothing but thieving vagabonds. Scum!

288
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:20,756
If they wanted to steal her,
why did they bring her back themselves?

289
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,597
Well, because...they're always up to tricks,
aren't they?

290
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,398
But we're too smart for 'em.

291
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,794
Hey! Don't try that with me,
you little beggar.

292
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,757
You stay away from her, miss.

293
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:35,195
She'd bite you as soon as look at you
if I know dogs.

294
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,432
You just want to go home, don't you?

295
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,793
Well, that makes two of us.

296
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,950
So do I.

297
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,552
Don't even think about it.

298
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,109
You'll not get under that.

299
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,349
It's buried too deep.

300
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,470
We're going on a nice trip together
tomorrow.

301
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:19,279
And it will be goodbye to Yorkshire,
for you, my girl.

302
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:06,191
Oof!

303
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,157
Get out of the way, you idiot!

304
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,230
Where is she? Eh?

305
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,914
-I say, where the bloody hell is she?
-Well, she's not here.

306
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,560
-Where's Joe?
-I don't know. He's not back yet.

307
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,710
He won't have got far. I'll find him.

308
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,074
I'll come with you.

309
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,991
We don't want any more funny business.

310
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,957
Just go right home, Mr Hynes.

311
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,759
Your dog'll be back to you,
just as soon as I find her.

312
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,114
Yeah, well, she better be.

313
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,509
The Duke's going to Scotland tomorrow

314
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,239
and he's taking the dog with him.

315
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,717
Joe.

316
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,234
You can't make this right
by stealing her back.

317
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:31,074
It's not stealing
when she comes by herself.

318
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,513
It is if we keep her.

319
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,477
She doesn't belong to us, Joe.

320
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,835
Not any more.

321
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,517
Come on.

322
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,477
Lass.

323
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,751
She'll come back again, you know.

324
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,353
They'll not keep her caged.

325
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:56,795
-Not this time, she won't.
-She will!

326
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,598
They're taking her away tomorrow.

327
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,557
-To Scotland.
-Where's that?

328
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,790
Long, long way, Joe.

329
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,429
Much farther than you'll ever travel
even if you live to be 100.

330
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,397
So let it go, eh?

331
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,233
Maybe when times are better,
we'll get another dog.

332
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,197
I don't want another dog, do I?

333
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,157
I never want another dog.

334
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,350
Yeah, I'm in all right.
Don't worry about that.

335
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,917
Eh, eh, keep your hands
where I can see 'em.

336
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,192
Here. Let me help you.

337
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:13,276
# Scotland The Brave

338
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:48,917
Oh...she brushes up nicely.

339
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,672
Good posture.

340
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:56,356
Great energy.
A little lacking in confidence, perhaps.

341
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,870
Let's see what they make
of each other. Come on.

342
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,757
She could be
what we've been looking for.

343
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:08,148
-Good morning, Grandfather.
-Morning, Cilla.

344
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,071
-Good morning, Lassie.
-Careful, miss.

345
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,230
-She's a nasty temper on her.
-No, she hasn't.

346
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,709
What do you think, Hey Hey?

347
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,870
Huh? What do you think of her, boy?

348
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,637
She's saying hello.

349
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,710
Best keep 'em apart,
till she learns some manners.

350
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:27,314
Exercise is what she needs.
That will cheer her up.

351
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,674
Keep her on a lead,

352
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:31,399
but I want her to get used to
the other dogs as soon as possible.

353
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:34,597
Come on. There's a kipper
in the dining room with your name on it.

354
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,989
Come on, you get in here. Oi! In here.

355
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,632
Joe?

356
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,829
Come on, Joe. You have to eat.

357
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,837
Please, Joe.

358
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:57,837
I love Lassie just as much as you.

359
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:02,153
And if I've done something wrong,
it's loving you more.

360
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,989
We'd barely enough food
for the three of us.

361
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:23,310
It would have been cruel to keep her.

362
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,757
Sometimes you have to let things go.

363
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,916
You can't hold on to everything.

364
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:37,231
Be happy that you knew her.

365
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:39,788
And that you watched her grow.

366
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:42,519
And that you helped make her strong
and beautiful.

367
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:46,359
So beautiful that
everyone who saw her knew it.

368
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:52,874
Think of it as an adventure for her.

369
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,871
And be proud of her.

370
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:56,596
Eh?

371
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,077
You just want to get out, don't you?

372
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,800
Go back where you came from,
like you did before.

373
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:58,356
I'll be the same if they send me
to some stuck-up boarding school.

374
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,718
Hey.

375
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,353
Get here!

376
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,715
Oi! Come here! Get here!

377
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:43,868
You go on. Don't worry.
I'll deal with this one.

378
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:46,713
I think it's time
we started your education proper.

379
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,677
That's it, in here. Come on.

380
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:49,670
Oi!

381
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,239
Get here!

382
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,554
Right.

383
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,473
Come on.

384
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,795
I'm not going to hurt you.

385
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,199
See?

386
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,952
Come here, will you!

387
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,675
Stop her!

388
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,431
Stop her, you stupid Scottish clods!

389
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:23,078
Are you deaf or something?

390
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:25,151
The dog, you idiot!

391
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,753
Urhh!

392
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,713
I'll do it.

393
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,072
Come back here!

394
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,633
What's going on?

395
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:56,314
I think Mr Hynes is playing a game
with the dogs.

396
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,277
Well, he's no business to!

397
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:02,909
-Don't open the gate!
-What did he say?

398
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,639
Don't touch that bloody gate!

399
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,432
Nothing.

400
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,839
-What did you say?
-I said, don't touch the bloody gate!

401
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,797
Oh, sorry.

402
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,552
What's going on?

403
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,596
The stupid girl's let the collie out.

404
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:30,557
What happened to your belt, Mr Hynes?

405
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:31,436
Um...

406
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:33,272
Were you using it on the dog?

407
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:37,353
-No, I was just teach...
-Mr Hynes, please do not say another word.

408
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:41,877
Never, under any circumstances, will I
allow anyone to attack an animal of mine.

409
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:45,669
Collect what wages are due to you
and leave my property immediately.

410
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:48,911
Otherwise, I will not be answerable
for the consequences.

411
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,439
I'll look after this for you.

412
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:54,476
Into the car, young lady!

413
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:56,152
But, Your Grace...

414
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:59,073
Your Grace, you don't understand!

415
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,677
Your Grace...

416
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,157
Never mind that.

417
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:15,117
I want to talk to you.

418
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:18,037
Come here.

419
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,637
Have you lost your tobacco?

420
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:26,551
No.

421
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:28,517
Just forgot I'd given up.

422
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,032
Because we're poor?

423
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:33,156
Well, times are not what they were, Joe.

424
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:36,673
And your mother said
I was smoking too much, anyway.

425
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:42,037
Listen.

426
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:44,588
I'm going to have to go away
for a little while.

427
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,351
To fight in the war?

428
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,317
No, not to fight, I hope.

429
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,311
Just to train and such.

430
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,436
It probably won't be any more than that.

431
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,830
I'm going to need you to look after
your mother while I'm away.

432
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,797
-But what about Lassie?
-Joe.

433
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,757
Joe.

434
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,512
You love Lassie, don't you?

435
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,079
You know I do.

436
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,071
Then be happy for her.

437
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,628
She's better off
where she'll get fed proper,

438
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:12,110
with a grand kennel and a fine big run,

439
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,953
with stable boys to wait on her
hand and foot.

440
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,477
So let it go.

441
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:20,879
Eh?

442
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:58,158
If she's not found quickly, she'll die.

443
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,674
She won't be able to survive on her own.

444
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:01,954
Why not?

445
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:04,873
Because the instinct for knowledge
has been bred out of her.

446
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,393
She's a pet.

447
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,756
She won't be able to fend for herself,
so she'll starve.

448
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:13,594
And that's if she doesn't
fall down a cliff first and break her legs.

449
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:16,990
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I shall call the police one more time.

450
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,759
You don't mean that.

451
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:22,189
You're just saying that
to make me feel bad.

452
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,157
And do you feel bad?

453
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:27,715
Yes.

454
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,950
Good! Now go to bed.

455
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,713
Bloody...lunatic animal!

456
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:38,398
Go on, get out of it!

457
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,357
Before I do something I'll regret.

458
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,917
Go on! Get out of it!

459
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:08,954
-Hungry, are you?
-I always eat when I'm worried.

460
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:11,679
There's no time for that.
She's been spotted.

461
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,513
-Where?
-On the road, ten miles south of here.

462
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:17,592
A farmhand saw her on his way to work
and called the police.

463
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,557
What are we waiting for? Come on!

464
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:22,752
-What about your breakfast?
-I'm not worried any more.

465
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:42,794
Wait a minute.

466
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,757
There she is, by the postbox.

467
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,717
We've found us a dog!

468
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,995
Come on, Nellie, you'll be late for school.

469
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:52,752
Isn't she bonny?

470
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:55,035
Take it easy. We don't want to startle her.

471
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,114
Young lady!

472
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:02,433
-Step away from the animal, please.
-Come on, Nellie.

473
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:04,829
Step away, please. I've got her.

474
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,797
Come on.

475
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,797
I'm not going to hurt you.

476
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,878
Keep that gate closed!

477
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:42,238
We'll not catch her now.
She's frightened.

478
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,197
She'll come back when she's hungry.

479
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:46,157
I don't think she will come back.

480
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:49,879
She's trying to get home,
like she did before.

481
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,797
What made you so late?

482
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,757
I got kept in.

483
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,671
What for this time?

484
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,637
-Nothing.
-Nothing?

485
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,874
Miss told me to sit down,
and I didn't hear her.

486
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,791
Daydreaming, I suppose?

487
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:51,348
-I couldn't help it.
-What do you mean?

488
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:55,799
It were near four,
and I heard a dog barking.

489
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:59,679
And I thought it were...Lassie.

490
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,034
Lassie?

491
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:02,832
Bloody Lassie?

492
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:05,480
If I hear that dog's name mentioned
one more time,

493
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:08,028
I swear I'll walk out
and leave the pair of you!

494
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:12,151
As if I haven't got enough to cope with!

495
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:31,957
Who's there?

496
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:34,637
Is somebody after my chickens?

497
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,437
Go on! Go on!

498
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:39,555
Go on!

499
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:45,470
Go on, you filthy mongrel!

500
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:49,394
You stay away from my chickens,
or I'll give you a taste of this!

501
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:28,997
236 against Surrey.

502
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:32,038
239, against Somerset, not Surrey.

503
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:35,277
I saw it myself.
Bowled leg stump for 239.

504
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:37,271
-In '32?
-Summer of '33.

505
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:39,635
At the Oval.
Rained a bit in the afternoon.

506
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,713
Wait a minute.

507
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:45,437
I think I've just seen something.

508
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,837
I can't see anything.

509
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,277
-Markland.
-What?

510
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:55,158
Name ofthe bowler.
I'll never forget it.

511
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:56,912
Yes, look. There.

512
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,877
In those bushes.

513
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:01,394
No. There's not a thing, old boy.

514
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:03,357
Give me those.

515
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,156
I think that's a dog you're looking at.

516
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:09,117
A dog? Don't be ridiculous.

517
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,837
Well, that's a dog, of course.

518
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:14,797
But what's it doing?

519
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:18,233
It's acting very oddly.
Perhaps it's seen the monster.

520
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:20,197
Very sensitive, you know, dogs.

521
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:23,439
Wait a minute!

522
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:25,397
That would be me, sir.

523
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:27,357
Yes, of course.

524
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,072
Well, what is she doing?

525
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:32,037
I'm not sure.

526
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:35,510
Maybe she's wanting to cross the loch
and cannae see how to do it.

527
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:37,636
-But that's impossible.
-Aye.

528
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:39,358
She would have to go round.

529
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:41,078
Go round? How far is that?

530
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:43,435
You've 100 miles
before she's back on this track.

531
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:45,590
Why would she want to do that?

532
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:47,557
She has business on the other side,
maybe.

533
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:49,915
Your collie's a Scottish breed originally.

534
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,231
And the Scots can be awful determined
when they put their mind to it.

535
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:54,992
You know, I think you're right.

536
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:56,792
What about?

537
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:59,599
It was the summer of '33
and Markland was the bowler.

538
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:01,591
I told you so, old boy.

539
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:04,194
There's not much
you can teach me about cricket.

540
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:12,157
It's getting a bit choppy, isn't it?

541
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:04,197
Come on, darling.

542
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:09,477
This is where Sarah will sleep.

543
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:11,073
All the beds are marked, dear.

544
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:14,709
So, if you find your number,
you'll know where you're sleeping.

545
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:16,677
Off you go, dear.

546
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:19,519
Do you remember your number, darling?
110.

547
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:38,357
Do I have to be a number?

548
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:40,317
Of course, dear. Every girl is.

549
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:41,958
Like the army.

550
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:53,557
Don't worry about me.

551
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:55,517
I know how to look after myself.

552
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:57,477
I know.

553
00:46:57,560 --> 00:46:59,039
Joe...

554
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:01,637
I'm relying on you, lad.

555
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:04,517
Don't let me down.

556
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:27,157
Goodbye, love.

557
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:28,514
See you soon.

558
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,877
Come along, girls.

559
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,877
No talking.

560
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:56,837
Lights out in three minutes.

561
00:47:57,840 --> 00:47:59,671
And you, young lady. Into bed.

562
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:02,354
I've got to do 100 strokes.
I promised my mother.

563
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:04,957
Well, hurry yourself up, then!

564
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:06,917
Everybody out now!

565
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,877
Lights out in two minutes.

566
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:42,557
Come along, everybody!

567
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:44,517
Rise and shine!

568
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:57,955
Oh!

569
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:27,311
Thanks a lot!

570
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:51,873
At last.

571
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:57,795
Don't even think about it, young lady.

572
00:49:57,880 --> 00:49:59,438
You're in enough trouble as it is.

573
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:02,114
Withers, if you'd be so kind.

574
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:23,233
That's a definite.
I'll give you odds of 100 to 1.

575
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:26,915
No accompanying adults,
poor appearance, weary demeanour.

576
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,638
I think you're right.

577
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:31,393
Pincer movement, Mr O'Donnell,
classic manoeuvre.

578
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:33,914
You drop off here,
approach from the rear, I move ahead.

579
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,390
Halt, take up a covert position and, bingo,

580
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:39,835
we attack from both sides,
with maximum effect.

581
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:41,273
Right, sir.

582
00:50:58,040 --> 00:50:59,758
Stand aside.

583
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:03,596
Come to the nice gentleman.

584
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:07,874
Steady.

585
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:13,199
Hold him, hold him.

586
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:16,595
You don't have to treat a dog like that.

587
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:19,035
Sorry, Mum, it's for the
protection of the public.

588
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:21,156
There's a lot of mad dogs around.

589
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:24,312
-Well, you don't have to do it like that.
She's right.

590
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:26,152
I beg your pardon, sir.

591
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:27,798
Well, you're upsetting the dog.

592
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:32,195
Oh, am I, really? I'm so sorry.

593
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:33,912
Am I upsetting diddums?

594
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,639
Get up. I'll put her in the van for you.

595
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:40,315
-It'll get away from you, Mum.
-Stop calling me "Mum" and stand up.

596
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:41,674
You should let her try.

597
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:44,320
We'll just have to go through it
all over again.

598
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:45,799
Stand up!

599
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:50,118
Hey, girl.

600
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:52,430
And take that away.

601
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:54,556
There you go, girl.

602
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:56,998
Please open the doors of your van.

603
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:58,479
I...

604
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:02,473
Don't stand there gawping like a halfwit.

605
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:16,068
There. You don't have to
treat stray dogs like wild beasts.

606
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:18,196
Very grateful, I'm sure.

607
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:19,508
Thank you.

608
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:21,670
Thank you. Show's over.

609
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:33,920
Can I just say,
I thought you were absolutely brilliant?

610
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,833
The rest of us just stood there
and you did something.

611
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:39,753
I had a dog like that when I was a kid.
Same eyes.

612
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:42,555
What will they do with her?

613
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:45,200
I'm not sure.
Keep hold of her for a while, I suppose.

614
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:48,158
If no-one shows up, they... Well, they...

615
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:50,708
They'll kill her?

616
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:53,189
It's quite humane.
Just put her to sleep or something.

617
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:55,191
No, you're right.

618
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:56,793
You're absolutely right.

619
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:58,711
-Where is the pound?
-I don't know.

620
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,631
I'm sure we can find it.

621
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:09,273
No nonsense from you.

622
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:19,233
Shut up, the lot of you!
You're not going anywhere.

623
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:27,675
Get in there. Go on!

624
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:29,676
Oh!

625
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:31,637
Mind the door, lad!

626
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:38,599
What are you doing, you stupid idiot?
No...

627
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:51,593
Watch out.

628
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:55,635
Step aside. Step aside. Mind your back.

629
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:04,758
Ah, hey...hey...

630
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:12,589
All rise.

631
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:19,871
You cannot come in. Court is in session.

632
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:24,312
My Lord, if I may respectfully...

633
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:25,913
Mr McTaggart.

634
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:29,595
Is this the surprise witness
the defence has promised?

635
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:30,908
My Lord...

636
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,992
I take it that is an answer
in the affirmative.

637
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:37,436
And I can congratulate the defence
on producing, finally, a witness

638
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:41,593
who is capable of answering yes or no
to a question without equivocation.

639
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:45,431
Have you lost a dog?

640
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:47,715
Yes, we have.

641
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:51,395
Mr McTaggart, whom am I addressing?

642
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:54,712
It's a dog, My Lord.

643
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:57,917
You confirm my own suspicions.

644
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,230
Well, well, well, a dog.

645
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:04,871
Sergeant of the court,
what do I want done with it?

646
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:06,916
You wish it removed, Your Lordship?

647
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,468
May I congratulate you
on your powers of deduction?

648
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,513
Well, go to it, man.

649
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:16,438
There's two men outside.

650
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:34,754
Silence, everybody.

651
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:37,912
Please don't startle the dog.

652
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,912
She cannot jump from there,

653
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:45,551
so please let the officers do their duty
quietly and safely.

654
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:48,473
Come on,
there's nothing to be frightened of.

655
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:02,111
Come on. Come on.

656
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:32,152
I've told you already,
we don't have a collie.

657
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:34,959
Not for a number ofweeks,
as a matter of fact.

658
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:38,555
I have a whippet and a couple of
very annoying terriers if you're interested.

659
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:42,554
That's them all back...at last.

660
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:45,878
-Fancy a cuppa?
You were there.

661
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:47,712
The collie. We've come for the collie.

662
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:52,031
We've brought money.
We'll pay for her, whatever it is.

663
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:54,233
She escaped.

664
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:55,673
Oh, brilliant.

665
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:58,558
Bloody brilliant!

666
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:01,029
Now we've got to fill in
a missing dog report.

667
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:03,315
A perfect record lies in tatters.

668
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:06,198
-We don't have a perfect record.
-Well, we haven't now, have we?

669
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:08,316
You mean, she's gone?

670
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:10,868
Yes, madam, she's gone.

671
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:14,396
Now, if you and your husband
wouldn't mind doing the same,

672
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:16,755
my colleague has a report to write.

673
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:20,072
What a couple of idiots.

674
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:21,434
Yes.

675
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:23,033
Husband, indeed.

676
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:25,350
Oh, that. Yes.

677
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:28,273
-Look...
-Yes?

678
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:30,430
I don't suppose you'd like to...

679
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:32,033
I mean...

680
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:34,839
I'd love to.

681
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:36,512
You would?

682
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:39,068
-Most definitely.
-Good.

683
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:43,109
I'm so sorry. About the dog, I mean.

684
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:44,599
Sorry?

685
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:47,194
Don't be. She's free now.

686
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:49,191
That's all I ever wanted for her.

687
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:47,710
I think we've got company, Toots.

688
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:52,718
I wonder what she wants of us.

689
00:58:56,880 --> 00:59:00,270
I think perhaps she vants to be alone.

690
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:19,718
Whoa!

691
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:41,479
Let's see if Miss Garbo's hungry,
shall we?

692
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,719
Hey, it's not for you, you greedy beast.

693
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:47,552
You're not a film star.

694
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:49,238
Not yet anyway.

695
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:15,076
You're no wild dog, are you?

696
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:22,119
There's a tyke, she's shy and canny,

697
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:25,669
And she's slowly coming near,

698
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:27,671
She's as cautious as my granny,

699
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:30,354
But will overcome her fear.

700
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:34,752
Whoa! Ho ho! Ho ho!

701
01:00:58,760 --> 01:01:01,115
Now, we know a trick or two,
don't we, Toots?

702
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:10,439
Let's see what Your Majesty thinks
of this, shall we?

703
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:23,072
There's your dinner, Your Highness.

704
01:01:24,120 --> 01:01:25,633
Eat up.

705
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:44,952
Come on, Toots.

706
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:47,076
We seem to have made a friend after all.

707
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:57,075
Put it down in the road and it's no good.
Too well trained.

708
01:01:57,160 --> 01:01:59,469
Put it down in a bowl.

709
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:01,272
That was the secret.

710
01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:03,078
That made it all right.

711
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:07,358
You'll have to come along with us
if you want any more.

712
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:20,919
Hello, Joe.

713
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:22,672
How was your day?

714
01:02:22,760 --> 01:02:24,671
Miss Branson liked my poem.

715
01:02:24,760 --> 01:02:26,079
Well, that's a surprise.

716
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:29,948
I didn't think she liked anything
other than the sound of her own voice.

717
01:02:30,040 --> 01:02:31,917
Did you hear from Dad?

718
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,753
No, but he'll be home for Christmas,
I'm sure of it.

719
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,116
We can't be beaten on our prices!

720
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:48,430
Fresh eggs! Get your fresh eggs here!

721
01:02:50,680 --> 01:02:52,398
Hello, everybody!

722
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:55,278
Hello!

723
01:02:55,360 --> 01:02:57,954
Has anybody seen my dog Toots?

724
01:02:58,040 --> 01:03:00,110
No!

725
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:02,509
Well, are you sure?

726
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:04,113
He's behind you!

727
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:05,599
Where?

728
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:08,399
He's behind you!

729
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:10,511
Oh! Ohhhh!

730
01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:16,118
Roll up! Roll up, ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls,

731
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:19,715
for the terrifying tale
of Androcles and the lion.

732
01:03:21,080 --> 01:03:23,310
What are you doing up there, Toots?

733
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:24,435
Come down.

734
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:30,673
Were you looking after the children?

735
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:33,989
Who wants to see a trick
by Toots the wonder dog?

736
01:03:34,080 --> 01:03:35,593
Me!

737
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:39,392
Up you go!

738
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:46,917
There you are.
A round of applause, please.

739
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:54,035
And now, ladies and gentlemen, the
terrifying tale of Androcles and the lion.

740
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:57,914
Your Highness, if you please.

741
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:05,753
You're doing fine, Your majesty.
You're doing fine.

742
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:08,434
So Androcles found himself alone
in the desert,

743
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:11,080
when suddenly
he heard a strange sound.

744
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:16,670
The poor slave Androcles
was very frightened by the lion,

745
01:04:16,760 --> 01:04:19,354
but then he noticed something unusual.

746
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:24,719
Looking closely, Androcles saw
there was a thorn in the lion's paw,

747
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:26,870
and that's why the lion was so unhappy.

748
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:29,918
So plucking up his courage,
he took hold of the lion's paw

749
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,468
and plucked out the thorn.

750
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:36,388
The angel Gabriel got a bit of a black eye
last year.

751
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:38,357
This year he'll have a new head.

752
01:04:38,440 --> 01:04:40,635
I reckon he'll be all right for Christmas.

753
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,877
What do you think?

754
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:48,757
Beginning to feel the cold, are you?

755
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:52,357
Winter's coming.

756
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:56,797
I think we're not going to make the Riviera
this season, Your Majesty.

757
01:04:58,120 --> 01:04:59,712
It's time to head back.

758
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:02,758
You'll like it at home. Won't she, Toots?

759
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:05,993
We best get tidied up.

760
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:08,677
Get an early start tomorrow.

761
01:05:13,960 --> 01:05:15,439
What the hell is that?

762
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:17,397
It's a bloody midget.

763
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:19,357
Is it, now?

764
01:05:20,520 --> 01:05:22,397
Or are we looking at a bloomin' dwarf?

765
01:05:23,240 --> 01:05:24,275
What?

766
01:05:24,360 --> 01:05:26,112
Dwarves or midgets.

767
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:28,589
You have to be sensitive
about these things.

768
01:05:28,680 --> 01:05:31,513
Dwarves are richer.
They dig for gold.

769
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:34,233
Then let's call it a dwarf.

770
01:05:34,320 --> 01:05:36,993
Do you think he'll have it with him -
the gold?

771
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:40,349
Let's go and ask the little fella, shall we?

772
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:51,280
-Watch your dog, little fella.
-It's all right.

773
01:05:51,360 --> 01:05:52,588
We ain't doing nothing.

774
01:05:52,680 --> 01:05:54,557
Quiet down, Your Majesty.

775
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:56,437
Quiet down.

776
01:05:56,520 --> 01:05:58,317
Toots.

777
01:05:58,440 --> 01:06:00,556
Thank you.

778
01:06:01,320 --> 01:06:02,833
Thank you very much.

779
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:11,994
Are you having a cuppa? Isn't that nice?

780
01:06:13,320 --> 01:06:16,790
Could you spare a swallow for a couple
of homeless chaps looking for work?

781
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:20,031
We've got a fresh-caught rabbit
by way of exchange.

782
01:06:20,120 --> 01:06:21,792
You're welcome, friend.

783
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:24,599
The water's almost boiled.
The tea's in the wagon. I'll get it.

784
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:26,079
No hurry.

785
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:28,799
-Is there, mate?
-No hurry at all.

786
01:06:31,080 --> 01:06:32,832
Only sorry we missed the show.

787
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:35,679
Big audience, was it?

788
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:39,837
Bet you make a killing this time of year.

789
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:41,797
Christmas coming and all that.

790
01:06:43,720 --> 01:06:45,597
Come on, where is it?

791
01:06:45,680 --> 01:06:47,159
The gold.

792
01:06:47,240 --> 01:06:51,518
Cos if you're nice and hand it over,
we won't hurt you.

793
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:53,079
Will we, Mr S?

794
01:06:53,160 --> 01:06:55,913
No...we won't hurt you.

795
01:06:57,680 --> 01:07:00,478
Afraid I haven't got any gold. Just tea.

796
01:07:01,800 --> 01:07:04,109
So you want it the hard way,
do you, little 'un?

797
01:07:05,160 --> 01:07:07,230
Fair enough.

798
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:11,268
Don't just stand there, get in after him,
you coward.

799
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:13,550
Argh! You little beggar!

800
01:07:15,120 --> 01:07:16,951
Stay out of this, Your Majesty!

801
01:07:17,040 --> 01:07:19,349
You want some of this, do you?

802
01:07:20,360 --> 01:07:23,830
Is this what you want?
Come on, my little beauty.

803
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:28,270
Go home! Get out of it!

804
01:07:31,640 --> 01:07:33,517
What a dog!

805
01:07:33,600 --> 01:07:37,275
You see, little fella,
even your best friend can't stand...

806
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:42,958
You get underneath the wagon,
I'll get the cash.

807
01:07:45,960 --> 01:07:47,678
Get off!

808
01:07:54,440 --> 01:07:56,317
Snickers, where are you?

809
01:07:57,480 --> 01:07:59,357
There's no sign of him under here.

810
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:00,793
I'm aware.

811
01:08:03,840 --> 01:08:05,319
No.

812
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:08,399
Argh!

813
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:09,595
Oof!

814
01:08:17,240 --> 01:08:18,559
Argh!

815
01:08:24,480 --> 01:08:26,869
Toots! Get away! Toots!

816
01:08:28,320 --> 01:08:30,231
You bloomin' rat!

817
01:08:53,280 --> 01:08:55,999
Get it off!

818
01:09:00,280 --> 01:09:02,157
Get off!

819
01:09:25,080 --> 01:09:26,957
I hate dogs.

820
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:28,758
I always have.

821
01:09:47,680 --> 01:09:49,671
Hello, there, my darling.

822
01:09:53,080 --> 01:09:55,594
You put up a pretty good fight,
didn't you, now?

823
01:09:57,640 --> 01:09:59,517
Quiet, Your Majesty.

824
01:10:00,680 --> 01:10:03,035
She hasn't much time left.

825
01:10:04,040 --> 01:10:06,190
Seven years we've been together.

826
01:10:06,280 --> 01:10:08,350
And I couldn't have asked
for better company.

827
01:10:12,240 --> 01:10:14,196
With blessings He has to spare.

828
01:10:14,280 --> 01:10:16,157
May God give them to you now.

829
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:04,276
The Lord says his Father notices
even the fall of a single sparrow.

830
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:09,354
So trusting in him, we commend
our dear friend to his bosom.

831
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:53,878
Come on, then, Your Majesty.

832
01:11:56,320 --> 01:11:58,197
Don't want to?

833
01:12:00,760 --> 01:12:02,637
Perhaps it's best that way.

834
01:12:03,320 --> 01:12:05,197
Still want to go south, do you?

835
01:12:06,040 --> 01:12:07,917
Winter in the Riviera.

836
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:10,877
With all the other la-di-dahs.

837
01:12:11,720 --> 01:12:13,199
I'd like to go with you but...

838
01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:15,157
winter's coming...

839
01:12:15,240 --> 01:12:17,117
and I'd best be getting back home.

840
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:24,317
Besides...

841
01:12:25,960 --> 01:12:29,555
..you'd always be reminding me
of my Toots, wouldn't you, Lass?

842
01:12:31,320 --> 01:12:32,230
Hey...

843
01:12:33,560 --> 01:12:35,198
That's the pity of it.

844
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:38,352
You can understand my language
but I can't understand yours.

845
01:12:38,440 --> 01:12:41,432
And it's us that's supposed to be
the most intelligent.

846
01:12:44,120 --> 01:12:46,759
We had some pretty good times together,
didn't we?

847
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:49,877
Yeah. Well...

848
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:53,597
Off you go, then.

849
01:12:53,720 --> 01:12:55,597
And may luck go with you.

850
01:12:59,160 --> 01:13:00,832
Off you go.

851
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:13,839
Come on, then, old girl.
Time to head for home.

852
01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:14,278
What was that?

853
01:14:14,360 --> 01:14:17,079
Some kind of animal, darling.
A fox, I should think.

854
01:14:17,160 --> 01:14:19,958
-It looked bigger than a fox to me.
-Look, we're here.

855
01:14:20,040 --> 01:14:22,600
-Will grandpa have a Christmas tree?
-Of course.

856
01:14:22,680 --> 01:14:24,636
It'll be the biggest you've ever seen.

857
01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:32,272
Can we light them now?

858
01:14:32,360 --> 01:14:35,318
No, darling. It'll burn down.

859
01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:36,958
It's all we've got left.

860
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:39,474
We'll light them
when we get back from church.

861
01:14:39,560 --> 01:14:42,757
Come on. You'll be late for practice.

862
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:49,075
# O come all ye faithful

863
01:14:49,160 --> 01:14:53,153
# Joyful and triumphant

864
01:14:53,240 --> 01:14:57,711
# O come ye, O come ye

865
01:14:57,800 --> 01:15:01,952
# To Bethlehem

866
01:15:02,840 --> 01:15:07,675
# Come and behold him

867
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:11,514
# Born the king of angels

868
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:15,832
# O come let us adore him

869
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:20,269
# O come let us adore him

870
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:25,710
# O come let us adore him

871
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:27,472
# Christ the Lord

872
01:15:27,560 --> 01:15:29,437
Happy Christmas.

873
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:32,357
I knew you'd make it.

874
01:15:34,080 --> 01:15:35,638
Is it snowing?

875
01:15:35,720 --> 01:15:38,280
Aye. Aye, it's beautiful outside.

876
01:15:39,720 --> 01:15:41,597
And inside too.

877
01:15:41,720 --> 01:15:48,718
# Leaving their flocks
draw nigh to gaze

878
01:16:59,400 --> 01:17:03,359
# In the bleak midwinter

879
01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:07,353
# Frosty wind made moan

880
01:17:07,440 --> 01:17:11,991
# Earth stood hard as iron

881
01:17:12,080 --> 01:17:15,834
# Water like a stone

882
01:17:16,680 --> 01:17:20,832
# Snow had fallen, snow on snow

883
01:17:20,920 --> 01:17:25,232
# Snow on snow

884
01:17:34,480 --> 01:17:39,349
# What can I give him

885
01:17:39,440 --> 01:17:43,831
# Poor as I am?

886
01:18:26,280 --> 01:18:30,319
Cricket, what's the matter with you?
You're not supposed to be in here.

887
01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:32,277
What are you doing?

888
01:18:37,160 --> 01:18:38,878
Where's John?

889
01:18:38,960 --> 01:18:40,837
I don't know. He were right here.

890
01:18:51,880 --> 01:18:53,757
Lassie...

891
01:18:54,760 --> 01:18:56,637
It's Lassie! She's come home!

892
01:19:52,600 --> 01:19:54,477
Listen for yourself, Joe.

893
01:19:56,520 --> 01:19:59,159
The heart's very faint. But it is there.

894
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:04,471
She's had a terrible ordeal and I can't
say whether it's possible she'll survive it.

895
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:08,911
An animal doesn't know how to fight for life
in the way a human often can.

896
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:12,675
It may be that, having got home
and having achieved what she wanted,

897
01:20:12,760 --> 01:20:16,833
she'll be content to just go to sleep
and...pass on.

898
01:20:17,640 --> 01:20:19,153
Is there anything we can do?

899
01:20:19,240 --> 01:20:21,800
Try and get her to eat something.

900
01:20:21,880 --> 01:20:23,950
Warm milk and brandy, I would suggest.

901
01:20:26,280 --> 01:20:28,396
We haven't got any brandy.

902
01:20:28,480 --> 01:20:31,040
I've got some. We were saving it
for the Christmas pudding.

903
01:20:31,120 --> 01:20:33,429
We'll all see how she is in the morning.

904
01:20:35,040 --> 01:20:36,917
I'll come round first thing.

905
01:20:57,320 --> 01:20:59,197
This is for you. I made it myself.

906
01:21:00,320 --> 01:21:02,197
For me?

907
01:21:03,040 --> 01:21:07,192
At school I wanted to remind myself
that it was still possible to escape.

908
01:21:07,280 --> 01:21:09,157
Did you, indeed?

909
01:21:42,320 --> 01:21:44,880
I know she's here,
so don't try and make any trouble.

910
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:48,032
I've got officers of the law with me
just in case you do.

911
01:21:50,240 --> 01:21:52,913
-He can't take her, can he?
-This is a sick animal.

912
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:54,831
She can't be moved.

913
01:21:54,920 --> 01:21:58,435
We have a certificate from the vet here,
saying she's fit to travel.

914
01:22:03,840 --> 01:22:05,717
Well, go on, then, get on with it.

915
01:22:06,480 --> 01:22:09,040
-Don't touch her.
-Sorry, Sam. We've seen the papers.

916
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:10,792
Everyone knows you sold her.

917
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:13,189
She's not going anywhere
unless I take her myself.

918
01:22:13,280 --> 01:22:16,033
That won't be necessary. Officers...

919
01:22:16,120 --> 01:22:17,997
She's under my care.

920
01:22:18,080 --> 01:22:19,911
I'm responsible for her.

921
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:21,797
What difference does it make?

922
01:22:21,880 --> 01:22:24,075
You want her back, he'll take her back.

923
01:22:24,160 --> 01:22:26,515
-No!
-You can come too, Joe.

924
01:22:26,600 --> 01:22:28,477
I'm not stopping here by myself.

925
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:31,028
I demand an escort
in case they run off with her.

926
01:22:31,120 --> 01:22:33,554
-They've tried it before, you know.
-Oh, shut up.

927
01:22:51,680 --> 01:22:54,319
Right, you keep an eye on them.
I'll get it sorted.

928
01:22:57,600 --> 01:22:59,158
That's it.

929
01:22:59,240 --> 01:23:01,708
Your Grace... Your Grace!

930
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:18,593
Mr Hynes is here, Your Grace,
and he was most insistent...

931
01:23:18,680 --> 01:23:20,557
I've found her, Your Grace,
I've found her!

932
01:23:20,640 --> 01:23:23,074
I've got her outside, just like you ordered.

933
01:23:23,160 --> 01:23:25,037
Lassie! He's found Lassie!

934
01:23:25,120 --> 01:23:27,793
Please, everybody stay here.

935
01:23:28,680 --> 01:23:30,477
I told you she'd not get past me.

936
01:23:30,560 --> 01:23:32,471
Detective work, Your Grace.
Months of it.

937
01:23:32,560 --> 01:23:34,232
I knew it would pay off in the end.

938
01:23:39,680 --> 01:23:41,955
She arrived here Christmas Eve.

939
01:23:42,080 --> 01:23:43,911
Very poorly.

940
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:47,913
We were...just looking after her
till she were well enough to bring back.

941
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:49,877
Mm-hm.

942
01:23:50,840 --> 01:23:53,400
And what are these officers
doing here, exactly?

943
01:23:53,480 --> 01:23:57,359
Well, Your Grace, Mr Hynes here
says that this here animal is stolen.

944
01:23:57,440 --> 01:23:59,795
-Quite insistent, he was.
-Was he, indeed?

945
01:24:01,360 --> 01:24:03,237
Well, let's have a look, shall we?

946
01:24:06,720 --> 01:24:09,553
Would you allow me to examine
your animal, young man?

947
01:24:18,200 --> 01:24:20,475
Well, I'll be blowed.

948
01:24:33,200 --> 01:24:36,988
All the way to Bermuda
and back again, what?

949
01:24:38,720 --> 01:24:40,597
-Please...
-Quiet, boy.

950
01:24:44,520 --> 01:24:47,557
I suppose you think I'm an old buffer
who's easily fooled.

951
01:24:47,640 --> 01:24:49,392
This isn't my dog.

952
01:24:49,480 --> 01:24:52,040
Any idiot can see that.

953
01:24:52,160 --> 01:24:54,116
She must be some kind of stray
you picked up.

954
01:24:54,200 --> 01:24:56,191
Don't try palming her off on me.

955
01:24:56,280 --> 01:24:59,716
The dog I bought was big and healthy.
Not a worn-out old mutt like this one.

956
01:24:59,840 --> 01:25:01,796
And Mr Hynes here knows that very well.

957
01:25:01,880 --> 01:25:04,030
Your Grace, look at these markings.

958
01:25:04,120 --> 01:25:07,032
-I'll stake my reputation...
-Reputation?

959
01:25:07,120 --> 01:25:10,999
Mr Hynes, I think we are both aware
what a fragile little creature that is.

960
01:25:11,080 --> 01:25:14,789
Don't be ridiculous, man. How could
a dog get all the way here from Scotland?

961
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:18,429
It's nearly 500 miles for a bird,
let alone for a dog, wandering about,

962
01:25:18,520 --> 01:25:20,590
trying to make its own way.
It's impossible.

963
01:25:20,680 --> 01:25:22,193
Wouldn't you agree, Officer?

964
01:25:22,280 --> 01:25:25,556
Yes, Your Grace.
If you say it's not yours,

965
01:25:25,640 --> 01:25:27,517
then that's the end of it.

966
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:31,513
You keep her if you want her.
Nothing to do with me.

967
01:25:32,640 --> 01:25:35,359
Nothing to do with me.
Come along, girlie.

968
01:25:41,920 --> 01:25:45,435
-That was kind of you.
-Nonsense. I'm not a kind person.

969
01:25:45,520 --> 01:25:47,750
-I'm not finished yet.
-What do you mean?

970
01:25:47,840 --> 01:25:49,353
Your Grace...

971
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:53,115
I swear that was your dog.
She knew me. I could tell.

972
01:25:53,200 --> 01:25:55,919
-Mr Hynes, are you still here?
-Yes, sir.

973
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,912
I mean, Your Grace...sir.

974
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:00,877
I'm sorry, but you must excuse us.

975
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:03,793
We were in the middle of lunch.
Some other time, perhaps.

976
01:26:03,880 --> 01:26:06,110
-But I'm telling you...
-Skipper, Bo'sun.

977
01:26:11,360 --> 01:26:13,999
Hello, boys. Remember me?

978
01:26:14,080 --> 01:26:17,152
Now, then, let's not get too excited, eh?

979
01:26:17,240 --> 01:26:19,754
Stay...stay...

980
01:26:19,840 --> 01:26:21,398
Cor lummie.

981
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,639
I have a proposition to make to you,
Mr Carraclough.

982
01:26:58,720 --> 01:27:01,359
Since the sad departure of Mr Hynes,

983
01:27:01,440 --> 01:27:03,556
we have a vacancy at the Hall.

984
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:05,511
I wondered if you'd be interested.

985
01:27:05,600 --> 01:27:08,910
Head kennel man, looking after my dogs.

986
01:27:09,760 --> 01:27:11,751
When the army is done with you,
of course.

987
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:13,751
The pay is fair enough, I should think.

988
01:27:13,840 --> 01:27:15,637
How much would "fair enough" be,
exactly?

989
01:27:15,760 --> 01:27:18,558
Ooh, I should say...

990
01:27:18,640 --> 01:27:20,676
-Seven pound?
-Good Lord, no!

991
01:27:20,760 --> 01:27:22,398
Five and not a penny more.

992
01:27:22,480 --> 01:27:25,870
-Six pound ten shilling.
-Shall we call it six guineas?

993
01:27:27,360 --> 01:27:28,713
Done.

994
01:27:30,760 --> 01:27:33,752
You drive a hard bargain,
Mrs Carraclough.

995
01:27:33,840 --> 01:27:36,559
And what about the kennel man's
cottage on the moor?

996
01:27:36,640 --> 01:27:39,712
As head kennel man, yes,
the cottage would be yours.

997
01:27:39,800 --> 01:27:41,677
You'd have to take the family.

998
01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:45,070
And, of course, any animals you have.

999
01:27:45,160 --> 01:27:47,469
Would that be acceptable?

1000
01:27:47,560 --> 01:27:49,471
Thank you, Your Grace.

1001
01:27:49,560 --> 01:27:51,630
That would be most acceptable.

1002
01:27:53,840 --> 01:27:56,638
That mutt of yours
is looking a little better, young man.

1003
01:27:56,720 --> 01:27:59,518
You won't be able to recognise her
in a couple of weeks.

1004
01:27:59,600 --> 01:28:02,592
I don't doubt it.
I don't doubt it.

1005
01:28:02,680 --> 01:28:04,557
Come on, girlie.

1006
01:28:27,040 --> 01:28:30,271
Now, don't wriggle.
I can't stand anyone wriggling.

1007
01:28:30,360 --> 01:28:32,954
See? You are nice after all.

1008
01:28:33,040 --> 01:28:36,749
Nonsense. I swore I'd have that dog
and now I've got her.

1009
01:28:36,840 --> 01:28:39,308
I just had to buy the man as well.

1010
01:28:40,080 --> 01:28:41,991
I think I've got a bargain, don't you?

1011
01:28:52,040 --> 01:28:54,270
Good morning, Mrs Carraclough.
Is Joe here?

1012
01:28:54,360 --> 01:28:57,955
Oh, hello. Aye, he's inside.

1013
01:28:58,040 --> 01:28:59,917
Go on, in you go and see him.

1014
01:29:01,280 --> 01:29:04,477
-Where are they?
-Ssh. Under the stairs.

1015
01:29:08,560 --> 01:29:10,437
-How many?
-Seven.

1016
01:29:11,640 --> 01:29:13,517
Seven.

1017
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:15,477
They are so beautiful.

1018
01:29:16,280 --> 01:29:18,157
Are they still blind?

1019
01:29:19,680 --> 01:29:23,468
No, they get their eyes open
when they're ten days old.

1020
01:29:24,200 --> 01:29:27,237
They'll be running about on their own
soon enough.

1021
01:29:34,440 --> 01:29:36,112
Come on!
