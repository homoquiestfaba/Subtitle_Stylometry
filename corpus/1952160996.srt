1
00:02:54,607 --> 00:02:56,370
Elizabeth here.

2
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,244
God. Hold on, Jane.

3
00:03:11,424 --> 00:03:12,857
Hello?.

4
00:03:23,937 --> 00:03:25,529
Like that. Got it?.

5
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:28,230
Just relax. You'll be okay.

6
00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:29,932
Okay?.

7
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:41,319
Your dragon mother.

8
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:44,022
Hello?.

9
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:47,970
He's such a jerk.

10
00:05:48,147 --> 00:05:51,605
My mother dies, and he doesn't
want me leaving for the funeral.

11
00:05:52,552 --> 00:05:53,985
Don't call my brother a jerk.

12
00:05:54,153 --> 00:05:55,177
You do.

13
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,516
Of course. I'm his sister.

14
00:05:58,091 --> 00:05:59,991
He's not a very good director.

15
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:01,649
I know.

16
00:06:02,995 --> 00:06:05,463
But he's my younger brother.
What am I gonna do?.

17
00:06:05,631 --> 00:06:07,656
Kick his ass?.

18
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:12,865
Okay.

19
00:06:15,174 --> 00:06:17,972
Mom, why are you so sad?.

20
00:06:18,144 --> 00:06:22,205
Grandma was a total bitch.
She treated us like shit.

21
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:24,577
Jason, where are you learning
to talk like this?.

22
00:06:24,751 --> 00:06:26,275
School.

23
00:06:29,956 --> 00:06:31,981
Well, Grandma wasn't all that bad.

24
00:06:32,158 --> 00:06:33,785
She was just....

25
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,190
Well, she was Chinese.

26
00:06:39,966 --> 00:06:41,695
Do you have to go out tonight?.

27
00:06:41,868 --> 00:06:46,100
I'm introducing the new Miss Taiwan
to all of Manhattan.

28
00:06:46,272 --> 00:06:47,796
Our families are in mourning--

29
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:50,943
Darling, I'm not going tomorrow.

30
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:52,702
Cindy.

31
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,175
My mother's dead.

32
00:06:57,083 --> 00:07:01,110
And your daughter has a dance recital
on Friday. Priorities?.

33
00:07:01,287 --> 00:07:03,084
Look, I thought as a family
we could--

34
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:06,157
We could pretend that we actually liked
the Dragon Lady?.

35
00:07:08,127 --> 00:07:12,530
Look, we'll come after
Emily's recital.

36
00:07:21,674 --> 00:07:25,906
By the way, will your mistress
be joining us in Seattle?.

37
00:07:26,078 --> 00:07:28,069
Jane, right?.

38
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:37,253
So how did Grandma die?.

39
00:07:38,324 --> 00:07:40,189
Oh, Emily....

40
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,493
I'm glad you all decided to come.

41
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:54,238
Your mother had one request:

42
00:07:54,774 --> 00:07:57,436
A traditional Chinese funeral.

43
00:08:02,615 --> 00:08:04,082
It takes seven days.

44
00:08:04,717 --> 00:08:07,117
Seven days?.
We never did that for Dad.

45
00:08:07,286 --> 00:08:09,015
Dad didn't request it, Mother did.

46
00:08:09,188 --> 00:08:10,212
Yeah, but seven days?.

47
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:13,688
What, your patients can't put off
their Botox injections for a week?.

48
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:16,920
Viola, thank you. We will do everything
we can to give Mother...

49
00:08:17,096 --> 00:08:20,031
...a traditional Chinese funeral.

50
00:08:23,202 --> 00:08:25,193
But how?. We're Americans.

51
00:08:25,371 --> 00:08:27,236
Hey, Alex and l
don't even speak Chinese.

52
00:08:27,406 --> 00:08:29,966
Well, Elizabeth, you know
something about it, don't you?.

53
00:08:30,142 --> 00:08:31,632
You live in Hong Kong.

54
00:08:31,811 --> 00:08:34,939
No, I really don't know
anything about it. Sorry, Viola.

55
00:08:35,114 --> 00:08:38,550
Our mother didn't want us to be raised
Chinese, that's why she hired you.

56
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:46,625
Well, I happen to know a hell of a lot
about traditional Chinese funerals.

57
00:08:47,927 --> 00:08:50,794
I was Chinese in a previous life.

58
00:08:52,231 --> 00:08:53,960
Oh, God. Give me a break.

59
00:08:54,133 --> 00:08:57,500
Alex, I've been in this family
since you were in diapers.

60
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:59,763
So please.

61
00:09:01,774 --> 00:09:04,402
You missed her 70th birthday.

62
00:09:05,611 --> 00:09:08,239
I was gonna come over, really.

63
00:09:08,414 --> 00:09:10,609
I just didn't wanna be the only one.

64
00:09:13,352 --> 00:09:16,446
You didn't call. None of you did.

65
00:09:16,622 --> 00:09:19,591
-I mailed a card.
-Got here two days late.

66
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:22,557
Viola, thank you
for taking care of her and us.

67
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:25,219
But you have no right
to say any of this.

68
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:27,127
Your mother had cancer.

69
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:30,497
-What?.
-She never told us.

70
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:32,433
You never asked her how she felt.

71
00:09:35,441 --> 00:09:36,465
She died alone.

72
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:38,909
And look at you kids.

73
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:41,107
Do you ever talk to each other?.

74
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,145
When was the last time
you were together?.

75
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:46,342
Stop that. Enough already.

76
00:09:48,955 --> 00:09:51,856
Elizabeth,
why isn't Michael with you?.

77
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:55,452
We separated almost a year ago.

78
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:57,357
Just after Sammy died.

79
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:58,554
I'm sorry.

80
00:09:58,731 --> 00:10:02,098
Look, our mother spent her entire life
pitting us against each other...

81
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:04,828
...and hardly had a kind word
for any of us.

82
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:08,997
Well, her last words
were that she loved you...

83
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:11,871
...and hoped you'd forgive her.

84
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:23,145
Now, the first thing you have to do
is get some monks.

85
00:10:23,322 --> 00:10:25,017
Chanting monks.

86
00:10:25,191 --> 00:10:26,988
And why can't you arrange that?.

87
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,386
Okay, fine.

88
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:31,826
Chanting monks.
How many, and where do I get them?.

89
00:10:31,998 --> 00:10:34,330
The temple. I know the place.

90
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,264
According to tradition,
children of the deceased...

91
00:10:37,436 --> 00:10:40,599
...must kneel at the shrine
three times a day...

92
00:10:40,773 --> 00:10:44,504
...1 0 minutes each,
and before bedtime.

93
00:10:46,445 --> 00:10:48,106
Has anyone heard from Meimei?.

94
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,680
Oh, you really think
she's gonna come?.

95
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,184
I can't believe she's gone.

96
00:10:58,124 --> 00:11:01,184
The last time we spoke,
I hung up on her.

97
00:11:02,795 --> 00:11:04,023
Me too.

98
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:09,096
I was such a disappointment to her.

99
00:11:09,602 --> 00:11:12,765
Hey, we all were.

100
00:11:15,307 --> 00:11:17,798
I dreamt about this.

101
00:11:18,277 --> 00:11:20,472
It was a nightmare.

102
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,572
Awful.

103
00:11:24,383 --> 00:11:27,546
She had died, and we....

104
00:11:29,755 --> 00:11:32,622
What?. We what?.

105
00:11:35,728 --> 00:11:38,060
We didn't care, Alex.

106
00:11:39,465 --> 00:11:41,763
That was the awful part.

107
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:15,230
My, my, isn't this a Kodak moment?.

108
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:17,335
Meimei. Dede.

109
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:19,368
-Hey.
-Where's the body?.

110
00:12:19,538 --> 00:12:21,165
At the funeral parlor.

111
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:25,174
What's all this?.

112
00:12:25,344 --> 00:12:26,504
A shrine.

113
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:29,671
Wow, this is so cool.

114
00:12:29,849 --> 00:12:31,714
We don't even have this
in China anymore.

115
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:33,545
-A shrine?.
-Yes.

116
00:12:33,719 --> 00:12:36,688
For dead people. Ghosts.

117
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:38,756
You wanna try this?.

118
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:44,520
Meimei.

119
00:12:48,567 --> 00:12:50,728
-Mama.
-Meimei.

120
00:12:51,403 --> 00:12:53,394
-Meimei. Meimei.
-Mommy!

121
00:12:53,572 --> 00:12:55,972
Oh, Mama.

122
00:12:56,142 --> 00:12:59,634
-You left us too soon.
-Meimei.

123
00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:03,780
That's really bad acting.

124
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:05,974
Yeah, Meimei,
there are no cameras here.

125
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:07,585
Get up.

126
00:13:15,394 --> 00:13:16,554
Your mom's dead.

127
00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:21,493
Can't you just try and be nice
to each other for once?.

128
00:13:21,934 --> 00:13:23,925
You're not family.

129
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:26,561
And you're not welcome here.

130
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:30,070
Alex, you asshole.

131
00:14:09,915 --> 00:14:11,246
You didn't eat a thing.

132
00:14:14,486 --> 00:14:16,647
I have to keep my figure.

133
00:14:17,489 --> 00:14:19,150
Ever seen a fat ninja?.

134
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,493
Eat.

135
00:14:30,002 --> 00:14:32,027
I subscribed to your magazine.

136
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:34,399
I read your column every month.

137
00:14:34,573 --> 00:14:38,304
I saw your last film.
It was very good.

138
00:14:41,647 --> 00:14:43,615
No, it wasn't.

139
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:51,147
Okay.

140
00:14:52,858 --> 00:14:54,553
Liz.

141
00:14:55,494 --> 00:14:58,019
I know you're angry at me.

142
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:01,795
I'm sorry I didn't come
to Sammy's funeral.

143
00:15:02,468 --> 00:15:04,197
I am.

144
00:15:05,304 --> 00:15:08,330
I just.... I....

145
00:15:08,974 --> 00:15:11,306
You were on location. It's fine.

146
00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:13,468
No, it's not.

147
00:15:14,179 --> 00:15:16,875
Damn it, Liz, just say how you feel.

148
00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:19,882
All right. It was not fine.

149
00:15:28,727 --> 00:15:31,218
So that's why
you and Michael broke up?.

150
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:36,165
Do you still see him sometimes?.

151
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:39,699
He flew in from Los Angeles
about a month ago...

152
00:15:39,872 --> 00:15:41,965
...and spent the weekend with me.

153
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:44,006
Do you still love him?.

154
00:15:45,177 --> 00:15:46,576
You believe in love?.

155
00:15:46,745 --> 00:15:48,007
Oh, Liz.

156
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:50,580
Absolutely.

157
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,752
You really can't be that naive.

158
00:15:55,387 --> 00:15:57,651
You sound just like Mom.

159
00:15:58,123 --> 00:15:59,988
No, I don't.

160
00:16:00,592 --> 00:16:02,856
Dede and I are planning
on having a baby.

161
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:07,265
You're gonna hate me?.

162
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:09,697
A baby?. How?.

163
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:14,561
Sperm. We just need some sperm.

164
00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:18,200
Oh, sperm. Right, of course.

165
00:16:19,111 --> 00:16:20,908
Are you gonna hate me?.

166
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:25,281
No. Stop asking me that.

167
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:28,316
Excuse me.

168
00:16:33,225 --> 00:16:34,988
What's with her?.

169
00:16:38,097 --> 00:16:39,962
She lost her son.

170
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:42,600
Yes, I know that.

171
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:27,039
I want you to unbutton your shirt.

172
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:29,571
I want you to feel my tongue...

173
00:17:29,748 --> 00:17:31,773
...Iicking across your lips.

174
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:35,249
My hands
slowly sliding up your thigh.

175
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:38,822
No, not right now. Not right now.

176
00:18:22,134 --> 00:18:24,102
T en minutes.

177
00:18:29,575 --> 00:18:31,304
Viola.

178
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:34,969
We should go to the funeral home now
to, you know, see her.

179
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:37,479
Well, you will see her
on the day of the funeral...

180
00:18:37,649 --> 00:18:39,708
...when she's all made-up
and looking pretty.

181
00:18:39,885 --> 00:18:42,649
Now, those
were your mother's wishes...

182
00:18:42,821 --> 00:18:44,812
...and vanity was her middle name.

183
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:46,821
What do you think?. Him.

184
00:18:46,992 --> 00:18:48,220
Sperm donor.

185
00:18:50,562 --> 00:18:51,824
Dede, please.

186
00:18:51,997 --> 00:18:53,988
Excuse me.
We're trying to make a baby.

187
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:58,664
-That's disgusting.
-What did you say?.

188
00:18:58,837 --> 00:19:00,668
Look who's talking.

189
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:02,101
Slut.

190
00:19:02,574 --> 00:19:04,303
Why don't you just shut your nasty--

191
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:05,807
Stop it, all right?.

192
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:08,105
We're only here seven days.

193
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,773
There is a lot to do
in these seven days.

194
00:19:10,949 --> 00:19:13,577
We have to notify
friends and relatives.

195
00:19:13,752 --> 00:19:15,811
Cemetery, tombstone.

196
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:18,752
Things for your mother's afterlife,
which we will then burn.

197
00:19:18,924 --> 00:19:22,553
The banquet, the eulogy,
some Chinese call it the résumé.

198
00:19:22,728 --> 00:19:26,220
And then on the fifth day, people will
come and they'll pay their respects--

199
00:19:26,398 --> 00:19:28,923
Embarrassing that you know all of this
and we don't.

200
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:30,568
Isn't it?.

201
00:19:31,403 --> 00:19:33,701
Alex, when is Cindy gonna be here?.

202
00:19:33,872 --> 00:19:36,136
Yeah, where is the ice queen?.

203
00:19:37,276 --> 00:19:40,439
Don't tell me Miss Taiwan 1 993
is not coming.

204
00:19:40,612 --> 00:19:43,604
Cindy will be here on the weekend.
Emily has a recital.

205
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:48,850
She didn't wanna come any earlier
because she can't stand any of you.

206
00:19:49,755 --> 00:19:51,848
Sometimes I don't blame her.

207
00:19:52,424 --> 00:19:54,153
Whatever.

208
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:27,524
Just feel the feng shui here.

209
00:20:27,693 --> 00:20:30,628
Look at the sunlight and the view.

210
00:20:30,796 --> 00:20:32,593
It's very nice.

211
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,132
How did Mom find it?.

212
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:38,133
Mom?. I'm the real-estate agent.

213
00:20:38,303 --> 00:20:39,702
You sell homes to dead people?.

214
00:20:39,871 --> 00:20:43,568
Shut up.
Real estate is real estate, okay?.

215
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:45,642
When these plots came out
on the market...

216
00:20:45,811 --> 00:20:48,143
...I got Mom a really good price.

217
00:20:48,313 --> 00:20:51,214
Plots?. You bought more than one?.

218
00:20:53,118 --> 00:20:55,086
It's tradition for a son and his wife...

219
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:57,484
...to be buried
next to his mother and father.

220
00:20:57,656 --> 00:20:59,590
Our father was cremated.

221
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:02,386
Oh, yeah, his ashes ended up
in a vacuum cleaner.

222
00:21:02,561 --> 00:21:04,051
By mistake. I was young.

223
00:21:04,229 --> 00:21:07,460
Well, wait a second. What did you say
about a son and his wife?.

224
00:21:07,633 --> 00:21:09,794
Mrs. iao bought three plots.

225
00:21:09,968 --> 00:21:13,301
One for her, one for you,
one for your wife.

226
00:21:15,073 --> 00:21:16,301
It's tradition.

227
00:21:16,475 --> 00:21:19,137
-Buy two, get one for free.
-I've heard of that tradition.

228
00:21:19,311 --> 00:21:20,835
Would you stop?.

229
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:24,306
My wife and l
will not be buried here.

230
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:28,345
You like this place so much,
bury yourself here.

231
00:21:31,089 --> 00:21:33,148
I knew your father.

232
00:21:34,026 --> 00:21:35,084
A powerful man.

233
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:38,691
That power is yours.

234
00:21:38,864 --> 00:21:40,991
You just don't realize it.

235
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:43,430
You have a responsibility here.

236
00:21:43,602 --> 00:21:45,832
Funerals are for respect.

237
00:21:46,338 --> 00:21:49,239
You're grieving
over your mother now.

238
00:21:49,408 --> 00:21:52,844
That must be why
you are not thinking clearly.

239
00:21:53,011 --> 00:21:54,444
Right?.

240
00:21:57,683 --> 00:21:59,844
-Alex.
-No.

241
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:15,429
It's hard to believe you've devoted
your whole life to this family...

242
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,659
...all those years.

243
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:19,827
Well, I was married young.

244
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:21,495
Not my doing.

245
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:24,073
And I was widowed young.

246
00:22:24,242 --> 00:22:25,266
Not my doing.

247
00:22:25,444 --> 00:22:27,969
But here I am.

248
00:22:28,146 --> 00:22:29,613
What about a family of your own?.

249
00:22:30,248 --> 00:22:32,739
Well, there are all kinds of families,
Dede.

250
00:22:32,918 --> 00:22:35,751
I would have thought
you realized that.

251
00:22:35,921 --> 00:22:37,752
Anyway, this is my family.

252
00:22:37,923 --> 00:22:40,289
And I would do anything for them.

253
00:22:40,459 --> 00:22:42,154
Anything.

254
00:22:43,395 --> 00:22:47,832
Well, I wish I had a mother like you.

255
00:22:49,134 --> 00:22:52,103
Meimei talks about you so much.

256
00:22:55,273 --> 00:22:56,433
Hey, did you see that?.

257
00:22:56,608 --> 00:22:59,668
-What?.
-Bedroom curtain upstairs.

258
00:22:59,845 --> 00:23:04,612
Mrs. Xiao's room. It just moved.

259
00:23:04,783 --> 00:23:06,546
No, it's the wind.

260
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:08,151
Well.

261
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:11,450
Do you believe in ghosts?.

262
00:23:12,424 --> 00:23:14,016
No.

263
00:23:14,826 --> 00:23:17,317
Maybe I don't. I don't. Do you?.

264
00:23:17,496 --> 00:23:19,191
Definitely.

265
00:23:22,534 --> 00:23:25,025
I need to smoke a joint.

266
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:46,721
Ten minutes.

267
00:23:47,659 --> 00:23:50,184
So does that mean we can eat?.

268
00:23:50,362 --> 00:23:53,695
Yes, and I made your favorite: pizza.

269
00:23:56,301 --> 00:23:57,928
-Hi.
-Hi.

270
00:23:58,103 --> 00:23:59,127
What's your name?.

271
00:23:59,304 --> 00:24:01,238
Bruce Lee.

272
00:24:01,406 --> 00:24:02,566
Bruce Lee?.

273
00:24:02,741 --> 00:24:04,732
What can I say?.
My parents are big fans.

274
00:24:07,846 --> 00:24:09,473
Let's talk.

275
00:24:10,215 --> 00:24:11,307
Come.

276
00:24:36,107 --> 00:24:38,405
-Hello?
-Hello, Michael?.

277
00:24:38,577 --> 00:24:40,841
So lesbians, huh?.

278
00:24:41,413 --> 00:24:43,711
-Yes, we are.
-Yes.

279
00:24:44,216 --> 00:24:46,446
And you are a monk.

280
00:24:46,618 --> 00:24:49,781
A Kalupa monk. We can have sex.

281
00:24:49,955 --> 00:24:52,617
Hey, Bruce, this is not about sex.

282
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,186
No sex?.

283
00:24:56,361 --> 00:24:57,521
No sex.

284
00:24:57,696 --> 00:24:59,425
But how?.

285
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:08,239
Right. Of course.

286
00:25:11,743 --> 00:25:13,370
I'm gonna have to think about this.

287
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:38,395
Meimei?.

288
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:40,401
Yes. And you are?.

289
00:25:40,572 --> 00:25:41,937
Chow Lin.

290
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:45,673
Do you have any idea what time it is?.
People are still asleep.

291
00:25:45,844 --> 00:25:49,109
In Beijing, they are awake.

292
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:53,479
I'm a friend of your mother's.

293
00:25:56,621 --> 00:25:57,883
You can get my bag.

294
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:06,893
Banana.

295
00:26:08,767 --> 00:26:10,667
Potassium.

296
00:26:12,971 --> 00:26:15,132
Good for digestion.

297
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:20,845
You mother sent me
photo of yours...

298
00:26:21,012 --> 00:26:25,881
...and videos of your awful movies.

299
00:26:26,051 --> 00:26:29,384
I know you all your life.

300
00:26:31,189 --> 00:26:32,884
Chow Lin.

301
00:26:35,961 --> 00:26:38,828
Oh, I am so glad
that you have come.

302
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:44,132
Oh, I'm the person who called you.

303
00:26:44,302 --> 00:26:45,894
Viola.

304
00:26:46,071 --> 00:26:47,800
Oh, Viola.

305
00:26:47,973 --> 00:26:52,672
The Jewish lady who can make
the best dumplings in the world.

306
00:26:52,844 --> 00:26:54,903
Oh, is it?.

307
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,378
Would you like something to eat?.

308
00:26:57,549 --> 00:26:58,641
American food.

309
00:26:58,817 --> 00:27:02,309
I want to eat like a pig.

310
00:27:02,487 --> 00:27:05,979
-Come then.
-Like a pig.

311
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:12,854
Outdoing yourself.

312
00:27:56,641 --> 00:27:59,109
No good bagels in Beijing.

313
00:27:59,277 --> 00:28:01,905
No good pancakes, no bacon.

314
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:05,607
I dream about a Burger King.

315
00:28:05,784 --> 00:28:07,411
Burger King.

316
00:28:07,585 --> 00:28:09,746
Meimei dreams about
Burger King too.

317
00:28:13,591 --> 00:28:17,687
Oh, here you go. Drink this.

318
00:28:18,963 --> 00:28:20,487
-Just drink and....
-Yeah.

319
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,701
Happy to meet you.

320
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:30,238
Finally, an honor.

321
00:28:32,477 --> 00:28:38,609
Now I go have a good poo.

322
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:43,087
-Go, go.
-Oh, I'll take you to your room.

323
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:46,780
Who is that?.

324
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:50,456
One of China's
most celebrated pianists.

325
00:28:50,628 --> 00:28:52,152
-You're kidding.
-No.

326
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:53,797
Mother met him in Rome.

327
00:28:53,965 --> 00:28:55,364
Oh, Rome.

328
00:28:56,201 --> 00:28:57,600
Mom went to Rome?.

329
00:28:57,769 --> 00:28:59,760
Yeah, before you were born,
I went with her.

330
00:28:59,938 --> 00:29:01,405
School vacation.

331
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:03,097
Oh, so you know this guy?.

332
00:29:03,274 --> 00:29:04,866
I was just a child.

333
00:29:05,043 --> 00:29:07,136
Liz, you were never just a child.

334
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,773
You know, I like Chow Lin.

335
00:29:10,949 --> 00:29:14,976
Anyone who has an appetite like that,
it's passionate.

336
00:29:16,187 --> 00:29:17,552
I'll get it.

337
00:29:17,722 --> 00:29:19,451
Today's day two, so we need--

338
00:29:19,624 --> 00:29:21,819
No, I thought it was day three.

339
00:29:21,993 --> 00:29:24,655
-Officially, it's day two.
-But in truth, it's day three.

340
00:29:24,829 --> 00:29:26,626
It's day two.

341
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:28,265
Look who's here.

342
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:30,230
It's Michael.

343
00:29:30,735 --> 00:29:31,861
Hello, Michael.

344
00:29:32,036 --> 00:29:33,503
Hi.

345
00:29:38,009 --> 00:29:39,738
Thanks for coming.

346
00:29:39,911 --> 00:29:42,004
Mother always liked you.

347
00:29:43,581 --> 00:29:44,946
I don't know why.

348
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:46,811
Me neither.

349
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:52,151
You know, of all the kids...

350
00:29:52,323 --> 00:29:55,053
...you're the only one
who calls her Mother.

351
00:29:55,226 --> 00:29:57,217
What?. Is that a problem?.

352
00:29:57,996 --> 00:30:01,261
Liz, she's your mom.

353
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:06,634
Look, I didn't come here for her.

354
00:30:07,405 --> 00:30:09,339
I came for you.

355
00:30:10,108 --> 00:30:11,666
For us.

356
00:30:20,952 --> 00:30:23,113
Mother's gone.

357
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:27,121
Sammy's gone.

358
00:30:27,692 --> 00:30:30,559
And he's not coming back.

359
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:32,826
There's no blame.

360
00:30:33,231 --> 00:30:35,062
There's no blame.

361
00:30:35,767 --> 00:30:39,498
Come on. Some love.

362
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:03,854
Hey, baby.

363
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:06,155
Aren't you done?.

364
00:31:06,331 --> 00:31:09,061
It's been a while.

365
00:31:09,234 --> 00:31:10,929
Hello?.

366
00:31:17,909 --> 00:31:20,400
Sorry, l--

367
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:24,280
It's not something I can just,
you know, turn on like a faucet.

368
00:31:24,449 --> 00:31:25,473
Isn't it?.

369
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:30,952
No, I need inspiration or activity.

370
00:31:31,122 --> 00:31:37,152
Well, you just have to
imagine like this.

371
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:43,561
I told you.
We're not gonna have sex.

372
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:48,604
But you'll just have to imagine.

373
00:31:49,374 --> 00:31:51,569
Imagine.

374
00:32:01,686 --> 00:32:02,846
I'm sorry.

375
00:32:03,021 --> 00:32:05,489
I tried. I did. I just--

376
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:09,055
It's okay. Thanks.

377
00:32:09,394 --> 00:32:11,521
I thought about it a lot last night.

378
00:32:11,696 --> 00:32:15,359
And I figured,
I might as well be, you know, useful.

379
00:32:15,533 --> 00:32:17,967
I mean,
we're not here to celebrate death.

380
00:32:18,136 --> 00:32:20,502
It's about celebrating life.

381
00:32:21,406 --> 00:32:23,874
Maybe one day,
we can all have dim sum together.

382
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:26,903
Meimei.

383
00:32:27,078 --> 00:32:29,273
Do you know the direct translation
of dim sum?.

384
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:30,914
No.

385
00:32:31,082 --> 00:32:32,572
It means ""touch the heart.""

386
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:39,589
So cute.

387
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:08,714
Oh, by the way, Liz,
Mom liked the Benz SUV.

388
00:33:08,886 --> 00:33:09,944
Really?.

389
00:33:10,121 --> 00:33:12,419
The G500 costs
more than a hundred grand.

390
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:14,615
We're not buying a real car.

391
00:33:14,792 --> 00:33:17,818
Oh, right. Sorry.

392
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:20,055
I always thought
this was an odd custom.

393
00:33:20,231 --> 00:33:23,462
Buy all this stuff,
and then you just burn it.

394
00:33:23,634 --> 00:33:27,968
Yeah, but I love the idea of Mom taking
all this stuff with her into the afterlife.

395
00:33:28,139 --> 00:33:30,164
Okay. Get the G500.

396
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:31,706
She really liked her Jag.

397
00:33:31,876 --> 00:33:33,537
Why don't we just get that?.

398
00:33:33,711 --> 00:33:35,838
What?. An old car?.

399
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:38,915
And have people think
we're being disrespectful?.

400
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:40,815
So, what do you think?.

401
00:33:40,985 --> 00:33:44,148
Should we get the Jag convertible
or the Benz SUV?.

402
00:33:44,322 --> 00:33:45,346
Buy both.

403
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:46,785
For your mother, right?.

404
00:33:46,958 --> 00:33:49,290
She'll only die once.
Give her the best.

405
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:50,859
Give her everything.

406
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:54,396
Give her $ 1 million.
I'll pay for shipping and handling.

407
00:33:54,565 --> 00:33:55,896
Shipping and handling?.

408
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:58,328
We all are from Taipei.

409
00:33:58,503 --> 00:34:00,266
Oh, we need all the stuff, like soon.

410
00:34:00,438 --> 00:34:03,339
Yeah, so you never heard of FedEx?.

411
00:34:03,508 --> 00:34:05,169
We'll take the G500.

412
00:34:05,343 --> 00:34:06,674
And the million dollars.

413
00:34:06,844 --> 00:34:08,778
Oh, and we need a house.

414
00:34:08,946 --> 00:34:11,312
Why don't we just take a picture
of Mom's house?.

415
00:34:11,482 --> 00:34:13,211
Oh, no, no, bad luck.

416
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:15,215
Then no one would want
to buy her house.

417
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:17,445
-Oh, we're not selling it.
-We're not?.

418
00:34:17,622 --> 00:34:19,988
-Dad's will. He wanted us to keep it.
-Why?.

419
00:34:20,158 --> 00:34:22,922
It's not even the house
we grew up in.

420
00:34:23,094 --> 00:34:24,925
Now that house had class.

421
00:34:25,096 --> 00:34:27,257
Who wants to live
in the McMansion?.

422
00:34:27,432 --> 00:34:28,456
I don't.

423
00:34:28,633 --> 00:34:31,625
-Dad bought that for Mom out of guilt.
-Guilt?.

424
00:34:32,537 --> 00:34:35,335
Okay, so, what else?. Maid, butler?.

425
00:34:35,506 --> 00:34:37,633
No, I refuse to burn people.

426
00:34:37,809 --> 00:34:39,572
Even if they are
made out of cardboard.

427
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:41,769
No maid, no butler. Fine, what else?.

428
00:34:41,946 --> 00:34:44,710
I got my phoenix and dragon.
They're on sale.

429
00:34:46,484 --> 00:34:48,611
You break, you buy, huh?.

430
00:34:49,854 --> 00:34:53,950
Hey, guys, these would hardly fit
a child, let alone a grown woman.

431
00:34:54,125 --> 00:34:56,286
Well, they made them fit,
didn't they?.

432
00:34:56,461 --> 00:34:57,587
Breaking the bones.

433
00:34:57,762 --> 00:35:00,390
Binding the feet so tight
that they wouldn't grow.

434
00:35:00,565 --> 00:35:03,659
Disgusting. I'll stick to high heels.

435
00:35:09,841 --> 00:35:13,004
Look, I have a letter. Never mailed.

436
00:35:13,177 --> 00:35:15,441
Written in Mother's handwriting
to her mother.

437
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:16,910
She had a mother?.

438
00:35:18,382 --> 00:35:19,474
Oh, my God.

439
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:21,379
-What?.
-Mother's name.

440
00:35:21,552 --> 00:35:23,144
What?. Linda?.

441
00:35:23,921 --> 00:35:25,513
Her Chinese name.

442
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:26,714
It wasn't Linda?.

443
00:35:26,891 --> 00:35:27,983
It's Ling Yuen.

444
00:35:29,494 --> 00:35:30,756
That sounds beautiful.

445
00:35:30,928 --> 00:35:32,088
What does it mean?.

446
00:35:32,263 --> 00:35:34,356
Highest cloud in the sky.

447
00:35:34,532 --> 00:35:36,591
It means strength.

448
00:35:37,902 --> 00:35:38,926
Well, read the letter.

449
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:41,262
Okay.

450
00:35:41,439 --> 00:35:43,566
Oh, my. Look at this.

451
00:35:43,741 --> 00:35:46,835
I gave this to her. Mother's Day.

452
00:35:47,278 --> 00:35:49,542
I made it in the third grade.

453
00:35:49,714 --> 00:35:51,375
I can't believe she kept it.

454
00:35:51,883 --> 00:35:52,907
Or this.

455
00:35:53,084 --> 00:35:55,279
Oh, God. Twilly Bear.

456
00:35:55,453 --> 00:35:57,216
Hello. My name's Twilly Bear.

457
00:35:57,388 --> 00:36:00,687
-Twilly Bear?.
-Alex slept with it till the 1 0th grade.

458
00:36:00,858 --> 00:36:03,292
-Shut up.
-Hey.

459
00:36:05,696 --> 00:36:07,425
-I didn't know this.
-What?.

460
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,929
We didn't know any of this.

461
00:36:11,102 --> 00:36:12,729
What is it?.

462
00:36:13,738 --> 00:36:17,299
During China's famine,
Mother was 1 6.

463
00:36:17,475 --> 00:36:19,272
In love.

464
00:36:20,077 --> 00:36:21,942
Her mother wanted her
to marry someone...

465
00:36:22,113 --> 00:36:25,549
...in one of those
arranged marriages.

466
00:36:25,716 --> 00:36:28,776
So she ran away to Hong Kong.

467
00:36:28,953 --> 00:36:35,381
Her boyfriend was supposed
to meet her, but he never made it.

468
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:38,757
Killed while crossing
the Pearl River.

469
00:36:39,063 --> 00:36:40,928
That's so sad.

470
00:36:41,098 --> 00:36:42,326
What else?.

471
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:48,132
In Hong Kong, she met a gentleman
much older than her.

472
00:36:49,407 --> 00:36:52,899
Wasn't sure she loved him,
but he was kind.

473
00:36:53,077 --> 00:36:54,101
Dad?.

474
00:36:54,278 --> 00:36:59,409
She grew to love him,
and they moved here to Seattle.

475
00:36:59,584 --> 00:37:02,280
And lived happily ever after.

476
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,449
Not quite.

477
00:37:04,622 --> 00:37:09,787
I remember the arguments
right after you were born.

478
00:37:09,961 --> 00:37:11,258
Dad had other women.

479
00:37:11,429 --> 00:37:12,589
He did?.

480
00:37:14,999 --> 00:37:17,968
I saw him with a few of them.

481
00:37:18,369 --> 00:37:19,768
A few?.

482
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,505
He said he still loved Mom though.

483
00:37:26,777 --> 00:37:29,837
Well, of course he did.

484
00:37:30,014 --> 00:37:34,314
Is that what you tell yourself after
you're done with your mistresses?.

485
00:37:34,485 --> 00:37:36,510
-Meimei.
-Oh, come on.

486
00:37:36,687 --> 00:37:39,451
A big, successful doctor
like Alex gonna tell us...

487
00:37:39,624 --> 00:37:41,615
...that he doesn't have mistresses?.

488
00:37:41,792 --> 00:37:43,817
I'm not gonna tell you anything.

489
00:37:43,995 --> 00:37:45,656
Good for you.

490
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:48,890
Why break the family tradition
of secrets and lies?.

491
00:37:49,066 --> 00:37:50,533
Guys, can we cut this out?.

492
00:37:50,701 --> 00:37:55,001
I mean, we have to write a eulogy
about a woman we clearly didn't know.

493
00:37:55,172 --> 00:37:57,470
What are we gonna say?.

494
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:38,920
Here you go.

495
00:42:00,084 --> 00:42:02,211
-I win.
-I let you win.

496
00:42:03,254 --> 00:42:04,778
Because you're old.

497
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:10,990
He's a good boy.

498
00:42:11,161 --> 00:42:12,628
Where's his father?.

499
00:42:12,796 --> 00:42:13,956
Ask Mrs. Xiao.

500
00:42:15,399 --> 00:42:17,924
She made me break up
with the only man I've ever loved.

501
00:42:18,102 --> 00:42:19,330
Why?.

502
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:22,839
He wasn't Chinese, was he?.

503
00:42:27,444 --> 00:42:28,911
We were gonna get married...

504
00:42:29,079 --> 00:42:32,242
...but when Mom made up her mind
about something....

505
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:35,317
Yes, I know.

506
00:42:35,786 --> 00:42:39,347
What are you doing here, really?.

507
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:45,929
Viola says your mother
wanted me to be here...

508
00:42:46,096 --> 00:42:49,862
...so I'm here.

509
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:52,827
You loved her, didn't you?.

510
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:14,314
Hey.

511
00:43:18,062 --> 00:43:20,553
Can't believe you still jog.

512
00:43:20,731 --> 00:43:22,824
I can't believe you stopped.

513
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:29,739
We're choosing a tombstone today.

514
00:43:34,044 --> 00:43:36,103
Want me to be there for that?.

515
00:43:39,083 --> 00:43:40,744
No.

516
00:43:42,086 --> 00:43:44,179
You really don't have to.

517
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:50,226
Look, you asked me to come.
I came.

518
00:43:50,794 --> 00:43:53,490
But don't push me away again.

519
00:43:54,264 --> 00:43:58,724
Liz, it's okay to miss Sam.

520
00:44:00,270 --> 00:44:02,397
I miss him every day.

521
00:44:03,841 --> 00:44:07,834
But, Liz,
we have to move on with our lives.

522
00:44:08,012 --> 00:44:12,244
Please, let me back in for good.

523
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:15,110
-Please, Liz.
-No.

524
00:44:20,624 --> 00:44:23,525
Okay, so if it were my mother...

525
00:44:23,694 --> 00:44:27,562
...nothing would be too big
or too expensive.

526
00:44:27,731 --> 00:44:29,926
Look at this lovely marble altar.

527
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:32,500
You could erect a statue
to your mother on that.

528
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:34,194
Stunning.

529
00:44:35,272 --> 00:44:38,605
I have a friend, he's a sculptor.
I could get you a deal.

530
00:44:38,776 --> 00:44:41,074
If it were my mother...

531
00:44:43,947 --> 00:44:45,744
...I would have a portrait done.

532
00:44:45,916 --> 00:44:50,216
Not as she was when she-- You know.
But how she is in my dreams.

533
00:44:51,288 --> 00:44:53,552
You can mount it
on that marble flat there.

534
00:44:53,724 --> 00:44:54,816
Beautiful.

535
00:44:55,559 --> 00:44:57,424
I have a friend. He's a painter.

536
00:44:57,594 --> 00:44:59,357
I can get you a deal.

537
00:45:01,965 --> 00:45:03,694
I like this one.

538
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:06,199
-Oh, if it were my mother--
-She's not your mother.

539
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:08,565
She's my mother. She's our mother.

540
00:45:08,739 --> 00:45:10,366
Got that?.

541
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:16,971
Alex, are you all right?.

542
00:45:17,147 --> 00:45:18,705
I'm fine.

543
00:45:20,851 --> 00:45:22,842
I like the simple
white marble tombstone.

544
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:24,817
It's tasteful.

545
00:45:24,988 --> 00:45:26,546
Agreed?.

546
00:45:27,925 --> 00:45:30,416
-Can you get me a deal on that?.
-Oh, of course, yes.

547
00:45:30,594 --> 00:45:31,618
Great.

548
00:45:31,795 --> 00:45:33,956
Meimei, show him to the door,
please.

549
00:45:45,476 --> 00:45:47,944
Alex, what are you doing?.

550
00:45:48,345 --> 00:45:50,006
Alex.

551
00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:07,859
I'm sorry.

552
00:46:10,534 --> 00:46:14,595
I used to hate Dad
for cheating on Mom, for hurting her.

553
00:46:15,873 --> 00:46:19,036
I used to tell myself
I'd never become like him.

554
00:46:23,147 --> 00:46:26,116
Here I am, I'm just like him.

555
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:31,149
While Mom's looking down,
she knows I'm a liar...

556
00:46:32,990 --> 00:46:36,357
...a cheat, and my wife hates me.

557
00:46:37,661 --> 00:46:41,028
-Well, there are reasons why we do--
-I can't rationalize.

558
00:46:46,570 --> 00:46:48,800
Where do I go from here?.

559
00:46:51,909 --> 00:46:57,176
Well, do you love Cindy?.

560
00:46:57,347 --> 00:46:59,781
Really love her?.

561
00:47:00,851 --> 00:47:02,751
I used to.

562
00:47:04,021 --> 00:47:05,955
Could you love her again?.

563
00:47:07,124 --> 00:47:08,785
I want to.

564
00:47:10,027 --> 00:47:11,551
Why?.

565
00:47:12,796 --> 00:47:14,525
Why do you want to?.

566
00:47:21,738 --> 00:47:24,434
Look, we have to be
at Mrs. Sun's in 20 minutes, okay?.

567
00:47:24,608 --> 00:47:25,905
We really need to go.

568
00:48:10,854 --> 00:48:12,754
I want to sing it at the funeral.

569
00:48:13,323 --> 00:48:14,881
It was your mother's favorite.

570
00:48:15,058 --> 00:48:16,423
It's very nice.

571
00:48:17,861 --> 00:48:20,989
I had no idea
that Mother liked that song.

572
00:48:22,065 --> 00:48:25,557
Mrs. Sun, you are mom's
favorite dressmaker, so--

573
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:29,604
Her only dressmaker, wasn't l?.

574
00:48:29,773 --> 00:48:31,365
Of course.

575
00:48:31,541 --> 00:48:35,204
And so we need you
to make her last dress.

576
00:48:38,048 --> 00:48:42,985
Back in China,
the daughters make the last dress.

577
00:48:45,289 --> 00:48:46,881
Well, this isn't China.

578
00:48:47,391 --> 00:48:49,621
What my sister really means
to say is that--

579
00:48:49,793 --> 00:48:51,055
You're the actress.

580
00:48:51,561 --> 00:48:53,461
I think you mean lesbian.

581
00:48:55,065 --> 00:48:57,124
She's the one who slept
with a black man.

582
00:48:57,301 --> 00:48:59,360
Elizabeth is the one
whose son passed away...

583
00:48:59,536 --> 00:49:01,231
...and Alex here has a mistress.

584
00:49:01,405 --> 00:49:03,236
We know
what our mom thought of us...

585
00:49:03,407 --> 00:49:05,875
...so can we just be done
with the gossip?.

586
00:49:06,643 --> 00:49:09,669
We're giving her
exactly what she wanted.

587
00:49:09,846 --> 00:49:13,680
A traditional Chinese funeral
and a traditional Chinese dress.

588
00:49:13,850 --> 00:49:16,011
So are you in or are you out?.

589
00:49:17,321 --> 00:49:18,549
I like you.

590
00:49:18,989 --> 00:49:21,583
Your mother was proud of you.

591
00:49:22,059 --> 00:49:24,084
All of you.

592
00:49:25,395 --> 00:49:27,192
She wouldn't shut up.

593
00:49:27,364 --> 00:49:30,731
"" My son, the doctor.
My daughter, the journalist.

594
00:49:30,901 --> 00:49:35,395
My daughter in real estate
and the movie star.""

595
00:49:39,276 --> 00:49:44,680
I will make the dress,
and it will be beautiful.

596
00:49:45,148 --> 00:49:47,275
Just like your mother.

597
00:49:58,795 --> 00:50:00,854
I am so confused.

598
00:50:01,031 --> 00:50:04,467
I thought I knew what to say
in this eulogy, but now....

599
00:50:04,634 --> 00:50:07,262
How could she have been
so proud of us to everyone else?.

600
00:50:07,437 --> 00:50:11,032
While with us, she was so....

601
00:50:11,208 --> 00:50:12,607
Bitchy?.

602
00:50:12,776 --> 00:50:17,679
Selfish, cruel, rude, manipulative?.

603
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:20,043
Dictatorial?.

604
00:50:20,884 --> 00:50:22,784
Saving face.

605
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:51,974
Do you believe in destiny?.

606
00:51:53,176 --> 00:51:54,837
Yes.

607
00:51:55,378 --> 00:51:56,675
You?.

608
00:51:57,447 --> 00:51:59,005
Yes.

609
00:52:01,518 --> 00:52:05,010
I believe each of us is connected.

610
00:52:08,358 --> 00:52:10,986
Without even realizing it.

611
00:52:18,568 --> 00:52:23,801
Just like the ingredients
in a wonderful meal.

612
00:52:25,642 --> 00:52:28,202
I believe you're strong.

613
00:52:29,179 --> 00:52:32,615
I believe I am in love.

614
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:38,715
Liz, dinner's ready.

615
00:52:39,122 --> 00:52:40,885
I'll be right down.

616
00:52:42,359 --> 00:52:44,020
Michael.

617
00:52:45,562 --> 00:52:47,393
I don't blame you.

618
00:52:48,131 --> 00:52:51,692
And I'm sorry
I can't always express myself.

619
00:52:52,435 --> 00:52:55,404
It's just gonna take
a little more time, okay?.

620
00:52:56,239 --> 00:52:57,536
Okay.

621
00:52:58,675 --> 00:53:00,336
I'm not going anywhere.

622
00:53:04,114 --> 00:53:05,240
Meimei.

623
00:53:06,049 --> 00:53:07,073
Hey.

624
00:53:07,584 --> 00:53:12,988
I just want you to know that, well,
I could always try again.

625
00:53:13,557 --> 00:53:15,787
You know, if you want me to.

626
00:53:16,193 --> 00:53:17,524
Yes.

627
00:53:17,694 --> 00:53:19,924
Okay. That'd be nice.

628
00:53:20,564 --> 00:53:22,191
Thank you.

629
00:53:22,732 --> 00:53:24,222
Well, great.

630
00:53:24,935 --> 00:53:25,993
See you tomorrow?.

631
00:53:26,169 --> 00:53:27,397
See you tomorrow.

632
00:53:28,171 --> 00:53:30,571
-Good night.
-Good night.

633
00:53:34,945 --> 00:53:36,879
Good night, Bruce.

634
00:53:38,381 --> 00:53:39,746
Good night.

635
00:53:51,428 --> 00:53:52,827
Is it hot?.

636
00:53:52,996 --> 00:53:55,055
No, it's great.

637
00:53:59,502 --> 00:54:01,936
Oh, my God. Good.

638
00:54:02,105 --> 00:54:05,074
Have we just corrupted a monk?.

639
00:54:11,114 --> 00:54:14,379
Your mother made me the executrix
of her estate.

640
00:54:14,551 --> 00:54:16,451
Why you?. You're not even family.

641
00:54:16,620 --> 00:54:18,053
Alex, Viola is family.

642
00:54:18,221 --> 00:54:19,381
Yeah, but I'm the son.

643
00:54:19,556 --> 00:54:20,614
Isn't that sexist?.

644
00:54:20,790 --> 00:54:21,814
Okay, fine. Forget it.

645
00:54:21,992 --> 00:54:23,584
I'm sorry, Viola. Please continue.

646
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:26,024
Okay, I just thought
this would be a good time...

647
00:54:26,196 --> 00:54:29,563
...to go over the contents of her will,
seeing that you all seem...

648
00:54:29,733 --> 00:54:31,667
...to be in a pretty good place.

649
00:54:31,835 --> 00:54:34,668
-Yeah, sure, so, what do we get?.
-Nothing.

650
00:54:35,538 --> 00:54:37,096
-Nothing?.
-Nothing?.

651
00:54:37,274 --> 00:54:38,764
-Nothing?.
-Nothing?.

652
00:54:38,942 --> 00:54:40,933
Well, the house is yours.
It's all of yours.

653
00:54:41,111 --> 00:54:42,544
Comes from your father's will.

654
00:54:42,712 --> 00:54:44,771
What about life insurance?.
Other investments.

655
00:54:44,948 --> 00:54:46,347
The gold, the jewelry?.

656
00:54:46,516 --> 00:54:48,711
She felt
thanks to your father's inheritance...

657
00:54:48,885 --> 00:54:50,876
...you were all in pretty good shape.

658
00:54:51,054 --> 00:54:53,284
I don't believe this.

659
00:54:53,990 --> 00:54:58,518
So she gave everything to
the Pacific Coast Community Center.

660
00:54:58,695 --> 00:55:02,529
-The what?.
-The Pacific Coast Community Center.

661
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:05,226
-Your mother believed in charity.
-She did?.

662
00:55:05,402 --> 00:55:07,563
Don't you tell me
what my mother believed.

663
00:55:07,737 --> 00:55:09,637
Well, I think it's a pretty good idea.

664
00:55:09,806 --> 00:55:13,333
You know what?.
Mom's will doesn't really surprise me.

665
00:55:13,510 --> 00:55:15,808
I mean, when it came to us,
she was so cheap.

666
00:55:15,979 --> 00:55:17,742
And she was cheap
with you too, Viola.

667
00:55:17,914 --> 00:55:20,348
I don't know why you stuck with her
all these years.

668
00:55:20,517 --> 00:55:22,542
Because I loved her.

669
00:55:22,719 --> 00:55:24,619
Because I loved all of you.

670
00:55:26,122 --> 00:55:27,749
I still do.

671
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:35,992
I have to go to the airport
to pick up Cindy and Emily.

672
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:37,463
You want me to go with you?.

673
00:55:37,634 --> 00:55:38,862
No, it's okay.

674
00:56:08,698 --> 00:56:10,529
You took that picture.

675
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:12,292
Remember?.

676
00:56:12,469 --> 00:56:13,936
Near the Vatican.

677
00:56:23,346 --> 00:56:26,577
I hope you didn't come
to shame the memory of my mother.

678
00:56:27,417 --> 00:56:29,885
No. Never.

679
00:56:39,062 --> 00:56:41,997
I never told anyone
after all this time.

680
00:56:42,832 --> 00:56:45,665
I think that's why
she criticized me the least.

681
00:56:45,835 --> 00:56:47,826
Because she was afraid of me.

682
00:56:48,505 --> 00:56:51,167
No. Grateful.

683
00:56:51,708 --> 00:56:53,300
You keep the secret.

684
00:57:18,101 --> 00:57:19,466
Cindy.

685
00:57:27,310 --> 00:57:29,073
I'm sorry.

686
00:57:30,547 --> 00:57:32,674
I wanna start over.

687
00:57:50,967 --> 00:57:52,594
We're here.

688
00:57:56,573 --> 00:57:58,302
Cindy.

689
00:57:58,741 --> 00:58:00,470
Emily.

690
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:02,300
Welcome.

691
00:58:02,712 --> 00:58:03,974
Hello, Victoria.

692
00:58:04,147 --> 00:58:07,139
It's nice to see
that some things remain constant.

693
00:58:09,018 --> 00:58:10,417
Bitch.

694
00:58:10,587 --> 00:58:11,884
What did she just say?.

695
00:58:12,055 --> 00:58:14,114
She said, ""Bitch.""

696
00:58:44,254 --> 00:58:46,017
I'm pregnant.

697
00:58:49,859 --> 00:58:52,123
Liz.

698
00:59:30,967 --> 00:59:32,628
Here, Mom.

699
00:59:32,802 --> 00:59:35,600
You take care of Sammy for us.

700
00:59:43,046 --> 00:59:44,513
Go ahead.

701
01:00:18,915 --> 01:00:20,439
Mom...

702
01:00:23,086 --> 01:00:25,020
...meet Dede.

703
01:00:26,589 --> 01:00:29,456
I think you'd really like her.

704
01:02:05,555 --> 01:02:07,022
Dede.

705
01:02:10,660 --> 01:02:12,252
Here you go.

706
01:02:13,996 --> 01:02:15,122
That's a lot.

707
01:02:15,531 --> 01:02:17,431
Well, it's been a while.

708
01:02:18,501 --> 01:02:20,162
Thank you.

709
01:02:22,338 --> 01:02:23,600
I've had an epiphany.

710
01:02:24,373 --> 01:02:25,965
I'm not a monk.

711
01:02:26,976 --> 01:02:28,102
But you are a monk.

712
01:02:28,811 --> 01:02:31,041
Inside, I'm not.

713
01:02:31,380 --> 01:02:33,041
Not anymore.

714
01:02:33,216 --> 01:02:34,808
That's my epiphany.

715
01:02:34,984 --> 01:02:36,542
Shoot.

716
01:02:38,888 --> 01:02:40,480
Am I going to hell for this?.

717
01:02:40,656 --> 01:02:41,816
No.

718
01:02:41,991 --> 01:02:45,358
Dede, I wanna thank you.
And Meimei, really.

719
01:02:45,928 --> 01:02:48,658
I became a monk
for all the wrong reasons.

720
01:02:49,332 --> 01:02:53,029
To please my parents,
to please everyone else but me.

721
01:02:53,202 --> 01:02:55,602
And that's not a good way to live.

722
01:02:56,205 --> 01:02:58,765
The honesty
that you and Meimei have...

723
01:02:58,941 --> 01:03:02,707
...and the way you just live
your lives openly without apology...

724
01:03:03,179 --> 01:03:05,409
...I find it inspirational.

725
01:03:06,149 --> 01:03:09,277
I wanna get married.
I wanna have lots of children.

726
01:03:09,452 --> 01:03:12,910
And I hope that one of them
will be yours and Meimei's.

727
01:03:14,957 --> 01:03:17,391
I'm not gonna be
coming back tomorrow.

728
01:03:19,095 --> 01:03:23,259
So please tell Meimei
that I said goodbye.

729
01:03:23,833 --> 01:03:25,027
You can tell her yourself.

730
01:03:26,035 --> 01:03:27,468
No.

731
01:03:28,604 --> 01:03:30,538
It's better this way.

732
01:03:41,851 --> 01:03:43,148
I'm pregnant.

733
01:03:46,088 --> 01:03:49,751
When you came to Hong Kong
a month or so ago, that one night.

734
01:03:54,797 --> 01:03:56,560
Aren't you gonna say something?.

735
01:03:59,869 --> 01:04:01,666
Thank you, God.

736
01:04:22,592 --> 01:04:23,957
Hey, Meimei.

737
01:04:24,126 --> 01:04:26,060
I've been looking all over for you.

738
01:04:26,229 --> 01:04:27,594
Look.

739
01:04:28,264 --> 01:04:30,824
The monk has delivered.

740
01:04:35,504 --> 01:04:36,562
-Stop.
-Are you okay?.

741
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:38,939
I found this on my pillow.

742
01:04:39,108 --> 01:04:40,803
From whom?.

743
01:04:43,312 --> 01:04:45,280
My mother.

744
01:04:45,948 --> 01:04:47,472
What did she say?.

745
01:04:49,719 --> 01:04:51,710
Meimei, are you okay?.

746
01:04:51,888 --> 01:04:53,480
No.

747
01:04:56,025 --> 01:04:59,153
No, I'm not okay.

748
01:04:59,328 --> 01:05:00,852
Meimei, what is it?.

749
01:05:01,030 --> 01:05:02,156
Meimei.

750
01:05:06,135 --> 01:05:07,966
What is going on?.

751
01:05:09,438 --> 01:05:15,104
This letter,
which says time to tell the truth.

752
01:05:15,278 --> 01:05:16,745
The truth?.

753
01:05:16,946 --> 01:05:20,382
I am Meimei's...

754
01:05:20,917 --> 01:05:22,350
...father.

755
01:05:25,721 --> 01:05:27,848
Holy cow.

756
01:05:28,824 --> 01:05:30,382
Meimei.

757
01:05:32,528 --> 01:05:34,155
Meimei.

758
01:05:35,264 --> 01:05:39,860
Your mother and I loved each other.

759
01:05:40,603 --> 01:05:43,595
We keep it a secret for you.

760
01:05:43,773 --> 01:05:45,468
Shut up!

761
01:05:45,641 --> 01:05:47,131
Shut up!

762
01:05:47,310 --> 01:05:49,471
Don't you talk to me.

763
01:05:49,645 --> 01:05:51,476
Don't you dare.

764
01:05:52,148 --> 01:05:55,811
My whole life has been a lie.

765
01:05:56,185 --> 01:05:57,209
Meimei!

766
01:05:58,487 --> 01:06:00,045
Meimei!

767
01:06:15,871 --> 01:06:18,101
Mom!

768
01:06:34,056 --> 01:06:36,820
Why didn't you tell me?.

769
01:06:36,993 --> 01:06:39,461
Why didn't you say something?.

770
01:06:39,628 --> 01:06:41,118
Why?.

771
01:06:41,964 --> 01:06:44,398
Why?.

772
01:06:47,636 --> 01:06:49,627
Meimei, it's okay.

773
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:55,705
It's all right.

774
01:07:05,054 --> 01:07:07,750
Why did you never tell me?.

775
01:07:09,025 --> 01:07:11,960
Mother made me promise not to.

776
01:07:14,597 --> 01:07:16,690
Everyone else knew?.

777
01:07:17,333 --> 01:07:19,233
Even Dad?.

778
01:07:20,603 --> 01:07:22,764
Dad suspected.

779
01:07:24,707 --> 01:07:27,232
Everyone suspected.

780
01:07:27,710 --> 01:07:30,008
No one knew for sure.

781
01:07:32,982 --> 01:07:35,883
Things aren't so black and white.

782
01:07:36,886 --> 01:07:40,822
No, they certainly aren't.

783
01:07:41,190 --> 01:07:44,182
Saving face.

784
01:07:45,528 --> 01:07:48,156
Saving face.

785
01:07:49,832 --> 01:07:52,494
I hate that expression.

786
01:07:52,668 --> 01:07:54,192
Yeah.

787
01:07:54,804 --> 01:07:56,601
Me too.

788
01:07:57,206 --> 01:07:59,436
So Chinese.

789
01:08:01,043 --> 01:08:03,944
We are Chinese.

790
01:08:06,482 --> 01:08:09,747
Yes. We are.

791
01:09:11,947 --> 01:09:14,177
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

792
01:09:14,350 --> 01:09:17,319
I'm gonna make myself a pot of coffee.
Would you like a cup?.

793
01:09:17,486 --> 01:09:20,182
-I don't drink coffee, thank you.
-Okay.

794
01:09:20,356 --> 01:09:23,519
So today is day five, right?.

795
01:09:23,692 --> 01:09:25,592
Where guests
come to pay their respects?.

796
01:09:25,761 --> 01:09:26,785
Yes.

797
01:09:26,962 --> 01:09:28,725
I'm sure
you have everything organized.

798
01:09:28,898 --> 01:09:31,867
Well, I think organization
is about respect.

799
01:09:32,668 --> 01:09:35,569
Well, I'm really good
at preparing food.

800
01:09:35,738 --> 01:09:37,729
-Maybe I can help.
-Well, it's already done.

801
01:09:37,907 --> 01:09:39,772
Victoria knows
a nice seafood restaurant.

802
01:09:39,942 --> 01:09:40,966
They have a buffet.

803
01:09:41,143 --> 01:09:43,407
Oh, my God. A buffet?.

804
01:09:43,579 --> 01:09:47,515
That's so tacky,
but again, it is Victoria.

805
01:09:47,983 --> 01:09:51,475
You know,
you're not Miss Taiwan anymore.

806
01:09:52,054 --> 01:09:53,078
I'm sorry, excuse me?.

807
01:09:53,255 --> 01:09:56,315
You heard what I said.
I said you're not Miss Taiwan anymore.

808
01:09:56,825 --> 01:09:58,986
I think you have forgotten
your place.

809
01:09:59,161 --> 01:10:02,062
My place is with this family.

810
01:10:02,231 --> 01:10:04,222
Where is yours?.

811
01:10:05,401 --> 01:10:08,336
Cindy,
your mother-in-law wanted one thing.

812
01:10:08,504 --> 01:10:11,268
That this family would come together
finally and for real...

813
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:13,806
...and I'd like to believe
that that can happen.

814
01:10:13,976 --> 01:10:15,443
Wouldn't you?.

815
01:10:22,017 --> 01:10:25,384
You know, it's difficult to forgive.

816
01:10:26,055 --> 01:10:27,386
I know.

817
01:10:27,556 --> 01:10:32,186
I think forgiveness is just about
the hardest thing in the world to do.

818
01:10:32,361 --> 01:10:34,090
And I hope you find a way to do it...

819
01:10:34,263 --> 01:10:38,131
...or you're gonna be
one unhappy person.

820
01:11:24,079 --> 01:11:25,706
So?.

821
01:11:26,749 --> 01:11:28,341
So?.

822
01:11:29,285 --> 01:11:31,310
Starting over?.

823
01:11:31,887 --> 01:11:33,582
Clean slate.

824
01:11:48,671 --> 01:11:55,042
Meimei,
meeting you completes my life.

825
01:11:57,379 --> 01:12:00,246
And completely changes mine.

826
01:12:11,293 --> 01:12:14,751
I'm not gonna make any more
cheap chop-chop movies.

827
01:12:15,731 --> 01:12:17,756
What are you going to do?.

828
01:12:18,233 --> 01:12:20,201
I have no idea.

829
01:12:20,669 --> 01:12:23,399
So does that frighten you?.

830
01:12:24,106 --> 01:12:25,664
No.

831
01:12:27,776 --> 01:12:30,142
I don't know what to call you.

832
01:12:30,512 --> 01:12:33,174
My name is Chow Lin.

833
01:12:52,901 --> 01:12:54,493
Only one chanting monk?.

834
01:12:54,670 --> 01:12:56,661
So cheap.

835
01:13:02,511 --> 01:13:04,775
May I have your autograph?.

836
01:13:04,947 --> 01:13:06,471
-Do you like kung fu movies?.
-Yes.

837
01:13:06,648 --> 01:13:10,448
Every Friday, your mother came to me
to buy fresh flowers.

838
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:13,347
One of my best customers.

839
01:13:13,522 --> 01:13:15,490
Cheap but loyal.

840
01:13:17,459 --> 01:13:18,926
These flowers.

841
01:13:19,094 --> 01:13:20,823
Not from my place.

842
01:13:20,996 --> 01:13:22,896
Oh, I'm sorry.

843
01:13:23,065 --> 01:13:25,397
My sister Victoria
got them from down the street.

844
01:13:27,669 --> 01:13:30,661
-Obviously.
-Would you like something to eat?.

845
01:13:30,839 --> 01:13:32,397
Please.

846
01:13:33,709 --> 01:13:35,574
Come. Sit down.

847
01:13:36,111 --> 01:13:40,946
Your mama paid my husband's
medical bills for two years.

848
01:13:41,116 --> 01:13:42,811
Well, how did you know her?.

849
01:13:42,985 --> 01:13:46,887
Your mother volunteered at the
Pacific Coast Community Center.

850
01:13:47,823 --> 01:13:49,120
You didn't know that?.

851
01:13:49,291 --> 01:13:52,192
Well, our mama's full of surprises.

852
01:13:59,568 --> 01:14:03,561
You know, over a hundred people
have come by since this morning.

853
01:14:04,406 --> 01:14:07,000
See, Grandma wasn't that bad.

854
01:14:08,076 --> 01:14:10,840
No. I guess not.

855
01:14:11,013 --> 01:14:13,607
Hey, what are they gonna say
about us?.

856
01:14:13,782 --> 01:14:15,875
When we're dead and gone?.

857
01:14:16,051 --> 01:14:17,541
They'll say we tried.

858
01:14:18,153 --> 01:14:19,950
We tried.

859
01:14:23,926 --> 01:14:27,020
-So I heard people talking shit.
-Talking shit?.

860
01:14:27,196 --> 01:14:29,221
You know, about you,
Grandma and Meimei.

861
01:14:29,398 --> 01:14:32,856
Kids hear everything. Because we're
shorter, we're under the radar screen.

862
01:14:33,035 --> 01:14:35,663
Oh, of course.

863
01:14:35,838 --> 01:14:38,204
So related, you and me?.

864
01:14:38,874 --> 01:14:40,774
In a way. Is that a problem?.

865
01:14:40,943 --> 01:14:42,843
No, no, it's cool.

866
01:14:43,745 --> 01:14:45,178
Want to learn something cool?.

867
01:14:45,347 --> 01:14:48,248
-What is it?.
-I teach you tai chi.

868
01:14:48,417 --> 01:14:49,782
Wow, like in the movies?.

869
01:14:49,952 --> 01:14:51,920
-Alexander.
-Thank you, Mrs. Sun.

870
01:14:52,087 --> 01:14:54,453
-Victoria.
-Thank you.

871
01:14:55,390 --> 01:14:57,017
Meimei.

872
01:14:57,526 --> 01:14:59,118
Elizabeth.

873
01:14:59,294 --> 01:15:01,694
Tradition. It's important.

874
01:15:01,897 --> 01:15:03,762
Yes, it is.

875
01:15:03,932 --> 01:15:05,593
Thank you.

876
01:15:06,401 --> 01:15:07,959
Goodbye.

877
01:15:11,874 --> 01:15:14,240
-Thank you, ladies.
-Take care.

878
01:15:14,409 --> 01:15:16,172
Goodbye.

879
01:15:24,620 --> 01:15:26,781
Speaking of tradition...

880
01:15:26,955 --> 01:15:31,915
...I seem to recall
a long-standing challenge...

881
01:15:32,094 --> 01:15:36,758
...between Alex and l,
and Victoria and Elizabeth.

882
01:15:36,932 --> 01:15:39,093
-Shall we?.
-Oh, no, no, no.

883
01:15:39,268 --> 01:15:40,860
Elizabeth shouldn't play.

884
01:15:41,036 --> 01:15:42,230
Why not?.

885
01:15:44,006 --> 01:15:45,064
Ask her.

886
01:15:45,541 --> 01:15:46,701
Why not?.

887
01:15:48,143 --> 01:15:49,633
Are you...?.

888
01:15:54,483 --> 01:15:56,883
-Oh, God.
-Oh, my God.

889
01:15:57,052 --> 01:15:59,384
God had something to do with it.

890
01:15:59,555 --> 01:16:02,023
And Michael made
a slight contribution.

891
01:16:13,168 --> 01:16:14,999
I've sent the last monk home.

892
01:16:15,170 --> 01:16:17,764
It is now time
for serenity and prayer.

893
01:16:18,874 --> 01:16:23,607
According to the old ways
at the end of the period of mourning...

894
01:16:23,779 --> 01:16:28,307
...the soul of the departed
comes back one more time.

895
01:16:28,784 --> 01:16:31,753
I would like you
to kneel at the shrine...

896
01:16:34,923 --> 01:16:37,357
...and close your eyes...

897
01:16:38,360 --> 01:16:42,626
...and see her in your soul.

898
01:16:56,111 --> 01:16:57,976
Now, can you see her?.

899
01:17:15,364 --> 01:17:19,266
I'm here with you, my children.

900
01:17:33,315 --> 01:17:36,341
Even when she's dead
she freaks me out.

901
01:17:37,219 --> 01:17:40,120
But am I dead?.

902
01:17:42,357 --> 01:17:44,188
Alexander.

903
01:17:44,760 --> 01:17:46,955
You look so serious.

904
01:17:49,131 --> 01:17:52,100
Well, I need to sit.

905
01:18:02,878 --> 01:18:05,073
Please have a seat.

906
01:18:12,721 --> 01:18:14,086
Okay.

907
01:18:14,256 --> 01:18:17,316
You are all angry.

908
01:18:17,492 --> 01:18:21,986
But look, I am dying.

909
01:18:22,431 --> 01:18:24,023
Liver cancer.

910
01:18:25,767 --> 01:18:29,066
The doctors gave me six months.

911
01:18:32,941 --> 01:18:37,037
Do you think I wanted to die
like Mrs. Chiu?.

912
01:18:37,446 --> 01:18:42,247
Never a kind word from her children
until she was gone.

913
01:18:44,119 --> 01:18:46,679
Do you think I wanted to die
like your father?.

914
01:18:47,656 --> 01:18:49,681
Full of regret.

915
01:18:50,559 --> 01:18:51,890
No.

916
01:18:53,195 --> 01:18:56,892
I wanted to bring my family together.

917
01:18:57,599 --> 01:18:59,089
I know.

918
01:18:59,267 --> 01:19:01,735
I haven't been the best of mothers...

919
01:19:01,903 --> 01:19:07,068
...but I hope I can manage to fix it.

920
01:19:07,676 --> 01:19:10,042
I want to tell you how I feel...

921
01:19:10,212 --> 01:19:14,546
...and I want to hear
how you really feel.

922
01:19:18,987 --> 01:19:23,617
What you've done here is
an example of just how manipulative...

923
01:19:23,992 --> 01:19:27,894
...selfish, arrogant,
and controlling you are.

924
01:19:29,765 --> 01:19:32,666
-It's a beginning.
-I'm not finished.

925
01:19:32,834 --> 01:19:37,862
And I don't believe for one moment
that you wanna hear how we feel.

926
01:19:38,039 --> 01:19:40,007
-Alex, we were just trying--
-Don't.

927
01:19:40,175 --> 01:19:41,540
You cannot rationalize this.

928
01:19:41,710 --> 01:19:44,338
But dying is never rational.

929
01:19:44,513 --> 01:19:46,481
Nor is your monstrous ego.

930
01:19:47,449 --> 01:19:49,383
But I did this for you, Alex.

931
01:19:50,652 --> 01:19:56,648
Mother, you're so full of yourself
that you actually believe that.

932
01:20:02,931 --> 01:20:04,796
Anyone else?.

933
01:20:05,333 --> 01:20:07,062
Congratulations.

934
01:20:07,235 --> 01:20:09,999
Very dramatic. Very Chinese.

935
01:20:10,172 --> 01:20:11,366
See?. She understands.

936
01:20:11,540 --> 01:20:12,905
No, I don't.

937
01:20:13,074 --> 01:20:15,508
You've put us
through a great deal of pain.

938
01:20:15,677 --> 01:20:17,702
You too, Viola.

939
01:20:17,879 --> 01:20:19,312
Are you angry?.

940
01:20:19,681 --> 01:20:23,515
I am exceedingly pissed off.

941
01:20:27,022 --> 01:20:33,188
Well, these are certainly
not the reactions I was expecting.

942
01:20:33,361 --> 01:20:34,794
What did you expect?.

943
01:20:34,963 --> 01:20:38,330
That we'd all fall at your feet
and be grateful you're still alive?.

944
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:41,060
-Well, yes.
-Don't hold your breath.

945
01:20:42,270 --> 01:20:45,967
Perhaps I should have
just remained dead.

946
01:20:46,141 --> 01:20:47,870
That would have been
a wise decision.

947
01:20:59,054 --> 01:21:01,545
Do you know how much
I love your daughter?.

948
01:21:01,723 --> 01:21:05,557
Yes, I think I do,
and it warms my heart.

949
01:21:05,727 --> 01:21:08,753
Welcome to our crazy family.

950
01:21:08,930 --> 01:21:10,056
Thank you.

951
01:21:10,232 --> 01:21:13,395
But I want to know how you did it.

952
01:21:13,568 --> 01:21:14,899
Yeah.

953
01:21:15,070 --> 01:21:18,039
Well, it's a big house.

954
01:21:18,573 --> 01:21:24,341
There's a hidden room off my bedroom
with its own bathroom.

955
01:21:24,512 --> 01:21:28,744
And Viola kept me informed
of all the comings and goings...

956
01:21:28,917 --> 01:21:33,479
...and of course,
I did overhear a thing or two myself.

957
01:21:34,456 --> 01:21:36,686
-Brilliant.
-Yes.

958
01:21:38,994 --> 01:21:41,326
Loose ends, you know.

959
01:21:41,496 --> 01:21:44,795
And here's my favorite loose end.

960
01:21:47,068 --> 01:21:49,798
I should be angry with you.

961
01:21:49,971 --> 01:21:51,871
Maybe a little bit.

962
01:21:54,042 --> 01:21:56,875
What do we do about Alexander?.

963
01:21:57,045 --> 01:21:59,172
I will talk to him.

964
01:22:01,816 --> 01:22:04,148
-Oh, excuse me.
-I hope you're not upset with me.

965
01:22:04,319 --> 01:22:07,516
It's a call from the set.
I have to answer it.

966
01:22:08,757 --> 01:22:10,190
Hello?.

967
01:22:10,358 --> 01:22:11,916
Hi, is this Dede Chan?

968
01:22:12,093 --> 01:22:13,958
Yes, it is.

969
01:22:14,129 --> 01:22:15,221
Who's calling?.

970
01:22:15,397 --> 01:22:17,228
I'm your brother's assistant director.

971
01:22:17,399 --> 01:22:19,367
Your brother
has just had a heart attack...

972
01:22:19,534 --> 01:22:21,695
...on the set here in Los Angeles.

973
01:22:21,870 --> 01:22:24,998
They've taken him
to Peterson Memorial Hospital.

974
01:22:25,674 --> 01:22:29,701
He's stable, and they're keeping him
under observation for now.

975
01:22:32,847 --> 01:22:34,815
Alexander.

976
01:22:36,618 --> 01:22:38,552
Leave me alone, Mom.

977
01:22:39,387 --> 01:22:41,287
Alexander....

978
01:22:42,757 --> 01:22:45,021
You are not your father.

979
01:22:46,061 --> 01:22:49,497
You have made mistakes,
and I have too.

980
01:22:49,664 --> 01:22:53,600
But my children are not mistakes.

981
01:22:54,269 --> 01:22:58,171
They are the best thing
that ever happened to me.

982
01:23:01,176 --> 01:23:04,668
You have been angry
for a long time.

983
01:23:04,846 --> 01:23:10,182
The past few days,
I've felt that anger lift.

984
01:23:10,352 --> 01:23:14,686
Wouldn't it be nice
if you could always live like that?.

985
01:23:20,228 --> 01:23:22,526
Our handsome boy.

986
01:23:23,198 --> 01:23:29,262
I did this hoping for happiness
for all of us.

987
01:23:30,538 --> 01:23:33,063
If it is selfish for a mother...

988
01:23:33,241 --> 01:23:38,474
...who wants to love her children
one last time...

989
01:23:38,646 --> 01:23:42,241
...then I am that selfish woman.

990
01:23:51,192 --> 01:23:53,217
I love you too, Mom.

991
01:24:13,815 --> 01:24:16,215
Are you sure you don't want me
to come with you?.

992
01:24:16,384 --> 01:24:18,852
I'm packed. I'm ready.

993
01:24:21,890 --> 01:24:24,120
No, Meimei, it's okay.

994
01:24:24,926 --> 01:24:26,450
Dede, I mean it.

995
01:24:26,628 --> 01:24:28,095
Meimei, stay here.

996
01:24:28,263 --> 01:24:30,493
How many times
do I have to tell you this?.

997
01:24:30,899 --> 01:24:33,299
Baby, your brother
had a heart attack.

998
01:24:33,701 --> 01:24:35,134
That's serious.

999
01:24:35,303 --> 01:24:37,066
I wanna be there for you.

1000
01:24:37,238 --> 01:24:40,730
I understand,
but your family needs you.

1001
01:24:40,909 --> 01:24:41,933
You stay here.

1002
01:24:43,611 --> 01:24:45,875
I love you, Dede Chan.

1003
01:24:46,047 --> 01:24:48,072
I love you too.

1004
01:24:49,651 --> 01:24:51,312
Come on, go.

1005
01:24:52,987 --> 01:24:54,614
You go on, baby.

1006
01:25:01,396 --> 01:25:07,028
Guys, I don't wanna make excuses
for what your mother and Viola did.

1007
01:25:07,202 --> 01:25:08,226
I mean, look at us.

1008
01:25:08,670 --> 01:25:11,639
We're here, we're talking.

1009
01:25:12,340 --> 01:25:15,468
And, you know, I think I do recall...

1010
01:25:15,944 --> 01:25:18,003
...hearing some laughter.

1011
01:25:20,849 --> 01:25:25,513
I mean, isn't it better
that all this happened before we die?.

1012
01:25:28,890 --> 01:25:31,154
Before she dies?.

1013
01:25:32,994 --> 01:25:37,192
I think that Dede did the right thing
going there, don't you?.

1014
01:25:37,365 --> 01:25:40,926
I mean, you'd do the same thing
for your brother. I know you would.

1015
01:25:41,102 --> 01:25:43,070
And he would do the same for you.

1016
01:25:43,505 --> 01:25:44,529
No question.

1017
01:25:57,719 --> 01:26:00,620
Does he always eat like this?.

1018
01:26:02,056 --> 01:26:03,284
Always.

1019
01:26:05,059 --> 01:26:06,526
Mom?.

1020
01:26:07,795 --> 01:26:10,025
I don't want you to die.

1021
01:26:10,698 --> 01:26:12,290
Neither do l.

1022
01:26:21,042 --> 01:26:23,670
Thank you, Victoria.

1023
01:26:25,980 --> 01:26:27,675
And Meimei...

1024
01:26:29,551 --> 01:26:31,143
...I'm sorry about Dede's brother.

1025
01:26:32,220 --> 01:26:33,847
Thank you.

1026
01:26:34,455 --> 01:26:37,686
Oh, I almost forgot. We're gonna have
to cancel the banquet tomorrow.

1027
01:26:37,859 --> 01:26:39,724
No, we should still do it.

1028
01:26:40,328 --> 01:26:42,956
As a celebration of life.

1029
01:26:43,565 --> 01:26:44,589
Your life.

1030
01:26:53,007 --> 01:26:55,601
Michael, I've always liked you.

1031
01:26:55,777 --> 01:26:57,836
I don't know why.

1032
01:26:58,012 --> 01:27:00,276
Probably just to make Alex jealous.

1033
01:27:08,823 --> 01:27:13,419
You know, Mom, I don't think any of us
ever really knew you until this week.

1034
01:27:13,595 --> 01:27:16,120
Yeah, you are smarter
than you look.

1035
01:27:18,099 --> 01:27:20,033
Thank you.

1036
01:27:21,769 --> 01:27:23,930
As for you...

1037
01:27:24,672 --> 01:27:26,640
...bravo.

1038
01:27:32,480 --> 01:27:35,040
-Bravo.
-Bravo.

1039
01:28:28,836 --> 01:28:31,771
I want to say something
to Mrs. Xiao.

1040
01:28:33,975 --> 01:28:38,002
That dress is worth a lot more
than what I charged your kids.

1041
01:28:39,113 --> 01:28:43,914
And I think what you did this week
for your children was great.

1042
01:28:45,286 --> 01:28:48,187
Now, do you think my kids
would fall for it?.

1043
01:28:48,356 --> 01:28:49,516
Oh, no.

1044
01:28:49,691 --> 01:28:52,216
Your children are too smart.

1045
01:28:57,165 --> 01:28:58,860
That's funny.

1046
01:29:08,843 --> 01:29:11,311
Thank you, everyone, for coming.

1047
01:29:11,779 --> 01:29:15,237
For those who came to the house
and gave money...

1048
01:29:15,416 --> 01:29:18,977
...Victoria will make sure
that you get it all back.

1049
01:29:19,153 --> 01:29:21,451
But I will keep the dress.

1050
01:29:24,692 --> 01:29:27,422
This is such a beautiful sendoff.

1051
01:29:27,595 --> 01:29:32,032
You have made this old lady
very, very happy.

1052
01:29:36,971 --> 01:29:41,670
Facing death changes everything.

1053
01:29:45,113 --> 01:29:50,415
So dragon lady no more.

1054
01:29:51,719 --> 01:29:54,017
Life is so fragile.

1055
01:29:55,423 --> 01:29:58,483
We must cherish each day...

1056
01:29:58,960 --> 01:30:03,556
...and all those who have a place
in our hearts.

1057
01:30:04,465 --> 01:30:08,458
Next week, I will leave for China...

1058
01:30:08,970 --> 01:30:11,803
...with Mr. Chow Lin.

1059
01:30:13,975 --> 01:30:17,934
I will die where I was born.

1060
01:30:19,447 --> 01:30:21,813
But before I do...

1061
01:30:22,683 --> 01:30:27,552
...I hope to take care
of some unfinished business.

1062
01:30:28,589 --> 01:30:32,525
If there's any advice I can give, it is:

1063
01:30:33,127 --> 01:30:36,221
Don't leave things till it's too late.

1064
01:30:47,542 --> 01:30:51,672
Well, let's dance.

1065
01:31:15,336 --> 01:31:17,031
Mr. Wang,
can I ask you something?.

1066
01:31:17,205 --> 01:31:18,695
Of course.

1067
01:31:18,873 --> 01:31:22,206
You're licensed by the state...

1068
01:31:23,277 --> 01:31:25,370
...so how could you do this
with my mom?.

1069
01:31:25,780 --> 01:31:28,374
Victoria, we're Chinese.
