00:00:07,374 --> 00:00:10,377
(exotic rock music)

2
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:10,236
(booming)

3
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:15,475
- [Soldier] Incoming!

4
00:01:15,475 --> 00:01:16,676
- [Officer] We need a stretcher.

5
00:01:16,676 --> 00:01:18,545
- [Soldier] Get in with us.

6
00:01:18,545 --> 00:01:20,713
(booming)

7
00:01:29,022 --> 00:01:30,490
- Where's that stretcher?

8
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:33,293
- [Soldier] Follow me, come on.

9
00:01:33,293 --> 00:01:36,463
(explosions booming)

10
00:01:36,463 --> 00:01:39,365
- [Officer] Where's that stretcher?

11
00:01:46,573 --> 00:01:49,109
- Three-five, Bloomquist, get me three-five.

12
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:52,412
- Come in, come in, three-five, come in.

13
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:55,215
Come in, three-five.

14
00:01:55,215 --> 00:01:57,083
- Bloomquist, come on, Bloomquist.

15
00:01:57,083 --> 00:01:58,885
- Sir, nothing, I can't raise them.

16
00:01:58,885 --> 00:02:02,889
(rapid gunfire and booming)

17
00:02:02,889 --> 00:02:05,325
- [Soldier] Over here.

18
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:06,726
- [Officer] Down.

19
00:02:09,863 --> 00:02:12,532
(rapid gunfire)

20
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,668
- [Soldier] Where's that medic?

21
00:02:15,668 --> 00:02:20,673
- Take cover, take cover. - Get your heads down.

22
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:25,345
(booming and gunfire)

23
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:28,014

24
00:02:30,717 --> 00:02:32,152
(grunting)

25
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:35,255
(explosions booming)

26
00:02:36,923 --> 00:02:39,626
(screaming)

27
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:41,761
- Where's our goddamn air cover?

28
00:02:41,761 --> 00:02:44,430
(rapid gunfire)

29
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:48,268
(grunting)

30
00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:51,471
- [Soldier] Incoming!

31
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:55,141
- Burn, you bastards.

32
00:02:57,677 --> 00:03:00,079
(cheering)

33
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:01,814
- [Soldier] Way to go.

34
00:03:01,814 --> 00:03:04,150
(booming and gunfire)

35
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:06,486

(rapid gunfire)

37
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:25,572
- Fall back, hey, fall back.

38
00:03:25,572 --> 00:03:26,406
Fall back.

39
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:30,476
(shouting)

40
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:35,848
(rapid gunfire and screaming)

41
00:03:35,848 --> 00:03:36,683
Fall back.

42
00:03:38,618 --> 00:03:42,722
- We're knocking it now, get under cover.

43
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:45,058
- Tango victor three-five, this is bravo three-seven.

44
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:46,826
Come in, three-five, come in.

45
00:03:46,826 --> 00:03:48,728
- Go ahead, three-seven, this is three-five.

46
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:50,096
- I need a med evac, three-five,

47
00:03:50,096 --> 00:03:52,265
and where the hell's my air cover?

48
00:03:52,265 --> 00:03:55,435
- Request temporarily denied, three-seven, no can do.

49
00:03:55,435 --> 00:03:57,303
- [Jeff] Three-five, this is Holland, I got wounded up here

50
00:03:57,303 --> 00:03:58,905
and I can't hang on much longer.

51
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,773
- Give me that.

52
00:04:00,773 --> 00:04:03,610
Holland, this is Colonel Wiggins.

53
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:07,814
Look, Tan Son Nhut is shut down, MACV won't give us nothing.

54
00:04:07,814 --> 00:04:10,016
- Three-five, you have to pack up 40 more body bags

55
00:04:10,016 --> 00:04:12,151
if I don't get some help up here and now.

56
00:04:12,151 --> 00:04:12,986
- Shit.

57
00:04:14,253 --> 00:04:16,656
Two-niner, this is three-five, are you up there?

58
00:04:17,624 --> 00:04:19,626
- [Pilot] I copy you, three-five.

59
00:04:19,626 --> 00:04:21,928
- You got any tricks you can pull?

60
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,196
- I'll see what I can do.

61
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,933
(tense music)

62
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:34,941
(booming)

63
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:37,777
- [Soldier] Incoming.

64
00:04:38,711 --> 00:04:41,047
(screaming)

65
00:04:42,582 --> 00:04:45,251

67
00:04:53,059 --> 00:04:55,728
(rapid gunfire)

68
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:00,133
(shouting)

69
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:03,002
(machine gun fire)

70
00:05:06,773 --> 00:05:09,442
(rapid gunfire)

71
00:05:12,278 --> 00:05:14,814
- [Soldier] Fall back, fall back.

72
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:17,483
(hopeful music)

73
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:20,486
- Birds coming in.

74
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:31,531
- Shit, captain, they made it.

75
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:36,069
- Ski, move it out, take them to the birds, let's move.

76
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:40,506
(rapid gunfire)

77
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:49,215
- [Soldier] Richard!

78
00:05:49,215 --> 00:05:50,817
(explosions booming)

79
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:52,418
(screaming)

80
00:05:52,418 --> 00:05:54,654
- Move it, let's go.

81
00:05:54,654 --> 00:05:58,091
Come on, double time.

82
00:05:58,091 --> 00:06:01,194
(helicopter whirring)

83
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:05,865
(rapid gunfire)

84
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:12,872
(booming)

85
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:16,709
- Oh shit.

86
00:06:18,678 --> 00:06:21,047
- Two-niner, come in, two-niner.

87
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:22,782
Two-niner, come in, over.

88
00:06:26,018 --> 00:06:26,819
Nothing, sir.

89
00:06:31,824 --> 00:06:35,128
(booming and screaming)

90
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:37,363
(shouting)

91
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:40,533
(explosion booms)

92
00:06:40,533 --> 00:06:42,869
(shrieking)

93
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:48,374
- Blue Lightning, Blue Lightning, this is three-seven.

94
00:06:48,374 --> 00:06:49,942
Pull up, two-niner is down.

95
00:06:49,942 --> 00:06:50,877
Pull up.

96
00:06:50,877 --> 00:06:52,145
We're moving into sector two.

97
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:54,380
Take out sector one on my command, over.

98
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:56,249
- Roger, we copy.

99
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:57,216
We're moving in.

100
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:02,188
(screaming)

101
00:07:02,188 --> 00:07:04,357
(booming)

102
00:07:05,424 --> 00:07:08,327
(rapid gunfire)

103
00:07:08,327 --> 00:07:10,830
(tense music)

104
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:22,642
- Blue Lightning.

105
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:25,044
- Roger.

106
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:32,151
(booming and screaming)

107
00:07:35,054 --> 00:07:38,224
(helicopter whirring)

108
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:46,232
(explosions booming)

109
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:52,038
(rapid gunfire)

110
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:54,874
(explosions boom)

111
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:03,516
(rapid gunfire)

112
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,990
(explosions booming)

113
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:22,335
(shouting)

114
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,939
(cheering)

115
00:08:31,143 --> 00:08:32,578
- Let's move out.

116
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:45,391
(speaking in foreign language)

117
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:52,231
- Colonel.

118
00:08:52,231 --> 00:08:53,566
- [Horace] What is it?

119
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:56,669
- They just hit ARVN Headquarters in Canturay Street.

120
00:08:56,669 --> 00:08:59,872
- You know, it seems to me I got a request

121
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:04,810
from Major Vo just yesterday about a fuel transfer?

122
00:09:05,678 --> 00:09:06,345
- They blew the truck, sir.

123
00:09:07,647 --> 00:09:08,848
- Old buddy Vo.

124
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:12,418
Guy never sleeps, does he?

125
00:09:12,418 --> 00:09:14,554
- We're sure gonna catch hell from MACV on this one.

126
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:15,388
- Nah.

127
00:09:16,522 --> 00:09:17,823
The brass doesn't care about protecting

128
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:20,593
anything except their own asses.

129
00:09:20,593 --> 00:09:21,827
Goddammit, I'm getting sick

130
00:09:21,827 --> 00:09:24,263
and tired of the way this war is being run.

131
00:09:24,263 --> 00:09:25,298
- Sir?

132
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:26,565
- Dismissed.

133
00:09:26,565 --> 00:09:28,401
- Maybe we oughta try bombing the Pentagon.

134
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:30,436
- You got no idea how much I'd like

135
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:32,905
to do just exactly that, lieutenant.

136
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:44,617
When did you get this?

137
00:09:44,617 --> 00:09:46,285
- Approximately 0700, sir.

138
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:50,189
(laughing)

139
00:09:50,189 --> 00:09:53,225
Her name's Dien Loc, she's a medical doctor.

140
00:09:53,225 --> 00:09:56,162
- Probably out there somewhere right now busting our chops.

141
00:09:57,463 --> 00:09:59,532
- Pretty conclusive, sir.

142
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:01,968
A South Vietnamese officer in contact

143
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:05,004
with a known VC sympathizer and then the same day

144
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:06,806
we lose a fuel shipment.

145
00:10:06,806 --> 00:10:09,241
- She's not a sympathizer, she's an operative.

146
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:15,481
Vo has been funneling information to the North through her.

147
00:10:15,481 --> 00:10:17,116
- I'd say we got a case, colonel.

148
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:19,919
- Nope.

149
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:21,420
This doesn't leave the room.

150
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:26,425
We don't need MACV's confirmation on this one.

151
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:29,295
Do we, son?

152
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:32,965
(tense music)

153
00:11:50,409 --> 00:11:53,312
- [Dien] Colonel, do you have them?

154
00:11:53,312 --> 00:11:54,980
Good.

155
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,482
- We got the bastard.

156
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:05,991
Freeze.

157
00:12:05,991 --> 00:12:08,661
(rapid gunfire)

158
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:27,947
Good evening, Major Vo.

159
00:12:29,014 --> 00:12:31,951
Enjoying the nightlife with Dr. Loc?

160
00:12:31,951 --> 00:12:33,619
- She was blackmailing me.

161
00:12:34,954 --> 00:12:37,356
She threatened my wife and my children.

162
00:12:37,356 --> 00:12:42,061
- That's too bad, well maybe you can help us out then.

163
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:43,629
Tell me who else were you talking to?

164
00:12:44,563 --> 00:12:45,397
- Nobody.

165
00:12:46,632 --> 00:12:47,466
Nobody but her.

166
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,201
- Nobody?

167
00:12:56,876 --> 00:12:59,011
(gunshot)

168
00:13:07,353 --> 00:13:08,220
I want names.

169
00:13:14,793 --> 00:13:16,962
(gunfire)

170
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:27,640
(gunshot)

171
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,474
(knocking)

172
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:29,475
Colonel Wiggins.

173
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:30,309
- Yeah?

174
00:14:05,544 --> 00:14:06,378
- Cap.

175
00:14:09,281 --> 00:14:12,184
We got a gook patrol on our ass about a half a click back.

176
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:14,353
- All right, split up.

177
00:14:44,516 --> 00:14:47,186
(rapid gunfire)

178
00:14:50,756 --> 00:14:52,992
(grunting)

179
00:14:56,362 --> 00:14:58,297
(rapid gunfire)

180
00:14:58,297 --> 00:15:00,633
(grunting)

181
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:03,602
(bones cracking)

182
00:15:03,602 --> 00:15:05,838
(grunting)

183
00:15:07,539 --> 00:15:10,209
(rapid gunfire)

184
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:23,856
(explosion booms)

185
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:28,460
(tense tones)

186
00:15:47,713 --> 00:15:51,183
All right, go get some chow and hit the rack.

187
00:15:51,183 --> 00:15:52,951
I'll see you guys in awhile.

188
00:16:06,065 --> 00:16:08,100
- Captain Holland, you made it back.

189
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,201
- Finally.

190
00:16:09,201 --> 00:16:10,436
- Sorry about Lennox.

191
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:11,670
- Not your fault.

192
00:16:12,838 --> 00:16:14,807
What's the news on Tet, they get it contained?

193
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:16,408
- We got it under control in Tay Ninh

194
00:16:16,408 --> 00:16:19,478
but everywhere else it's a mess, you wouldn't believe it.

195
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:21,046
MACV got caught with their pants down

196
00:16:21,046 --> 00:16:22,448
and they're falling over themselves trying

197
00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:23,749
to explain it to the press.

198
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:26,185
I don't see how the hell they can explain it.

199
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:28,821
The VC got 11 battalions into Saigon.

200
00:16:36,295 --> 00:16:39,465
(helicopter whirring)

201
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:48,207
General O'Neal.

202
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:06,091
- The enemy is weak now.

203
00:17:06,091 --> 00:17:07,726
He's desperate, scattered.

204
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:12,998
Sir, I want your permission to mount a counteroffensive.

205
00:17:13,999 --> 00:17:15,434
Look at this.

206
00:17:15,434 --> 00:17:18,337
Now, we have reliable information that suggests--

207
00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:21,140
- Colonel, that is a map of Cambodia.

208
00:17:22,007 --> 00:17:23,709
- Yes, sir, it is.

209
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:26,645
- This isn't what MACV wants to hear, Wiggins.

210
00:17:26,645 --> 00:17:29,348
Confidentially, we're preparing a request

211
00:17:29,348 --> 00:17:30,716
for troops from Washington.

212
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:35,354
A counteroffensive wouldn't look good, not now.

213
00:17:35,354 --> 00:17:38,657
- Sir, you let us go where Charlie is

214
00:17:38,657 --> 00:17:40,692
and we can bring him down, for God's sake.

215
00:17:40,692 --> 00:17:45,063
- Look, Wiggins, across the border operations

216
00:17:45,063 --> 00:17:47,232
are not sanctioned by the President.

217
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:50,903
That means no Americans in Cambodia, not even tourists.

218
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:54,206
- I will do anything I have to to win this war.

219
00:17:54,206 --> 00:17:55,874
- Well, don't expect any backup

220
00:17:55,874 --> 00:17:57,509
if your operation gets exposed.

221
00:18:02,014 --> 00:18:04,516
- Captain Holland, you've got a debriefing, sir.

222
00:18:04,516 --> 00:18:05,617
- That's why I'm here.

223
00:18:08,687 --> 00:18:10,622
- By the way, do you have the body count?

224
00:18:10,622 --> 00:18:12,558
- My men have much more important things to do

225
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:15,093
than feed the number crunchers in Washington.

226
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:18,330
- Well, I expect your report first thing

227
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:20,332
in the morning, colonel.

228
00:18:20,332 --> 00:18:22,501
- All right, sir, you'll get your numbers,

229
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:25,437
but you tell the boys in Saigon they had better support

230
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:26,738
the men on the front line.

231
00:18:45,524 --> 00:18:46,458
(speaking in foreign language)

232
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:47,392
(speaking in foreign language)

233
00:18:47,392 --> 00:18:51,163
(speaking in foreign language)

234
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:52,965
(speaking in foreign language)

235
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:55,000
(speaking in foreign language)

236
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,937
(speaking in foreign language)

237
00:19:01,406 --> 00:19:04,042
(speaking in foreign language)

238
00:19:04,042 --> 00:19:07,980
(speaking in foreign language)

239
00:19:15,854 --> 00:19:19,091
- All right, gentlemen, I got bad news,

240
00:19:19,091 --> 00:19:20,359
we're pulling out tonight.

241
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:22,094
(grumbling)

242
00:19:22,094 --> 00:19:23,362
All the way uptown, let's go.

243
00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:26,965
- All right, I'm ready for some pussy.

244
00:19:26,965 --> 00:19:29,067
- Yeah, baby. - I like it.

245
00:19:30,702 --> 00:19:33,238
- Hey, Bloom, you wanna go out and get laid, man?

246
00:19:33,238 --> 00:19:35,407
- Oh, I gotta finish this letter to my girl.

247
00:19:35,407 --> 00:19:38,010
- Oh come on, Guy, man, you got enough time for her.

248
00:19:40,646 --> 00:19:44,616
By the way, man, that's D-E-A-R.

249
00:19:46,051 --> 00:19:47,352
Oh come on, Guy, let's go.

250
00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:51,790
(whooping and catcalling)

251
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:57,329
Shake it, baby, don't fake it.

252
00:19:57,329 --> 00:19:58,430
Put in a bag.

253
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:02,301
(whooping)

254
00:20:06,605 --> 00:20:08,173
- So what'd I tell you, huh?

255
00:20:08,173 --> 00:20:11,677
- [Sheriff] I got a deal to close tonight.

256
00:20:16,415 --> 00:20:17,749
- Woo-hoo, yeah.

257
00:20:20,018 --> 00:20:21,320
(barking)

258
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:24,056
- American soldiers in the house.

259
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:29,161
- Captain Holland?

260
00:20:29,161 --> 00:20:32,230
The old man wants to see you.

261
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:34,499
(laughing)

262
00:20:36,835 --> 00:20:38,537
- We got it going on here, sarge.

263
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:40,706
Woo, yeah.

264
00:20:44,109 --> 00:20:45,811
- So, how's the colonel holding up?

265
00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:48,614
- He's a great leader, Holland.

266
00:20:50,449 --> 00:20:53,452
Hell, I'll say it, he's a genius.

267
00:20:53,452 --> 00:20:54,686
I'd follow him anywhere.

268
00:20:55,687 --> 00:20:57,022
- The man's unconventional.

269
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:00,759
- He doesn't play the game the way you're supposed to.

270
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:04,263
You know, if you ask me, he oughta be running this war.

271
00:21:06,832 --> 00:21:07,933
- What is this?

272
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:09,434
- What's it look like?

273
00:21:10,736 --> 00:21:11,937
- [Jeff] Railroad tracks.

274
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:14,139
- That's exactly what it is, captain.

275
00:21:15,874 --> 00:21:17,709
- There's a huge French plantation

276
00:21:17,709 --> 00:21:20,045
on the other side of the border.

277
00:21:20,045 --> 00:21:21,947
They're running a small gauge railway,

278
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:24,249
supposedly to haul out the rubber.

279
00:21:24,249 --> 00:21:26,685
- I've repeatedly asked for an airstrike

280
00:21:26,685 --> 00:21:31,590
to disable that line, but MACV always denies me.

281
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:32,424
- Why?

282
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:34,726
- It's in Cambodia.

283
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:45,837
- All right, Ropes, I think I gotcha this time.

284
00:21:45,837 --> 00:21:48,273
Lucky sevens over kings, buddy.

285
00:21:48,273 --> 00:21:50,342
(laughing)

286
00:21:50,342 --> 00:21:53,045
Well, I guess I'll just start counting this money,

287
00:21:53,045 --> 00:21:54,780
go on over to the PX and buy myself some--

288
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:56,882
- Wait a minute, wait a minute.

289
00:21:56,882 --> 00:21:58,517
Come back anytime, sweetheart.

290
00:22:00,018 --> 00:22:01,520
There you go, captain, read 'em and weep.

291
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,722
- No, no no no no no.

292
00:22:03,722 --> 00:22:05,390
You shit-canned me again.

293
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:07,492
- No way, captain, no way.

294
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:09,928
Marty open all night long.

295
00:22:09,928 --> 00:22:11,630
- Attention.

296
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:13,365
- At ease, gentlemen.

297
00:22:15,634 --> 00:22:17,703
That your money, marine?

298
00:22:17,703 --> 00:22:18,537
- Yes, sir.

299
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:21,006
- Better get it off the table.

300
00:22:24,042 --> 00:22:28,547
Well I got bad news, men, Firebase Maryland is gone.

301
00:22:30,148 --> 00:22:32,384
I know a lot of you had buddies up there.

302
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:35,320
The trouble is the numb nuts at the desks

303
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,823
make us fight with our mittens on.

304
00:22:37,823 --> 00:22:41,193
You think Ho Chi Minh does that to his troops?

305
00:22:43,762 --> 00:22:45,464
Anybody recognize this territory?

306
00:22:46,665 --> 00:22:47,799
- That's Cambodia, sir.

307
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,102
- That's right.

308
00:22:50,102 --> 00:22:51,770
I've been interrogating prisoners.

309
00:22:53,238 --> 00:22:56,374
It seems they've got a supply line just across the border

310
00:22:56,374 --> 00:22:59,845
they're using as a springboard every time they hit us.

311
00:22:59,845 --> 00:23:02,347
- All our problems can be traced right back to that.

312
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:05,217
- You never would have lost Lennox

313
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:07,753
if we'd been allowed to make a preemptive strike.

314
00:23:07,753 --> 00:23:09,654
- Well why don't we hit them mothers then?

315
00:23:09,654 --> 00:23:11,757
- Yeah, where does it say we always gotta play clean?

316
00:23:11,757 --> 00:23:13,125
Come on, captain.

317
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:14,493
- Come on, let's go for it.

318
00:23:17,362 --> 00:23:20,832
- Sir, if you wanna take out the NVA commander

319
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:23,468
who's running the show in our sector,

320
00:23:23,468 --> 00:23:26,238
I can give you a highly motivated top notch LRRP team.

321
00:23:28,006 --> 00:23:30,575
- Any of you speak the local lingo?

322
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:32,010
- No, sir. - Not me.

323
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:34,513
- Sir, how about Sergeant Park?

324
00:23:36,782 --> 00:23:38,316
- Good idea.

325
00:23:38,316 --> 00:23:41,019
- All you gotta do is give the go ahead, sir.

326
00:23:41,019 --> 00:23:42,387
Let's get it done.

327
00:23:42,387 --> 00:23:43,588
- We'll never get the nod if we go

328
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:44,890
for an official clearance.

329
00:23:46,725 --> 00:23:50,829
- Captain, you know I can't order you to do this,

330
00:23:50,829 --> 00:23:52,631
this is strictly off the shelf.

331
00:23:54,132 --> 00:23:55,634
You men are the best I've got.

332
00:23:57,202 --> 00:24:00,872
- Anybody wants out, speak up now.

333
00:24:00,872 --> 00:24:02,474
- Payback time.

334
00:24:02,474 --> 00:24:05,243
Payback time is payback time.

335
00:24:05,243 --> 00:24:08,914
- Captain Holland, your job is to seek out those tracks

336
00:24:08,914 --> 00:24:09,781
and destroy them.

337
00:24:10,882 --> 00:24:13,485
(upbeat music)

338
00:24:34,539 --> 00:24:38,710
(speaking in foreign language)

339
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:41,880
(helicopter whirring)

340
00:24:43,748 --> 00:24:45,383
- Let's go, let's go.

341
00:24:48,253 --> 00:24:51,790
(speaking in foreign language)

342
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:55,727
(speaking in foreign language)

343
00:25:06,638 --> 00:25:08,073
- Let's go, move.

344
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:12,177
(exotic action music)

345
00:25:45,844 --> 00:25:49,514
All right, other side of that ridge is Cambodia.

346
00:25:49,514 --> 00:25:52,417
Once we cross that border, we no longer exist.

347
00:25:52,417 --> 00:25:54,052
- What happens if we get caught?

348
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:57,022
- Don't expect any help from the actual MAC, sonny boy.

349
00:25:57,022 --> 00:25:59,557
- Yeah, in other words, don't fuck up.

350
00:26:01,927 --> 00:26:02,761
- Let's move.

351
00:26:08,533 --> 00:26:11,202
- Sir, Captain Thuy is here to see you.

352
00:26:11,202 --> 00:26:12,037
- Send him in.

353
00:26:19,444 --> 00:26:20,412
- Colonel.

354
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:21,680
- What is it, Thuy?

355
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,615
- I am convinced that Major Vo was murdered.

356
00:26:24,816 --> 00:26:26,518
- [Horace] Do you think the Cong did it?

357
00:26:26,518 --> 00:26:27,786
- [Tan] No, sir, I don't.

358
00:26:29,054 --> 00:26:30,288
- Who then?

359
00:26:30,288 --> 00:26:32,057
- Apparently someone on the base, sir.

360
00:26:33,058 --> 00:26:33,892
- An American?

361
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:38,363
That's a very interesting theory, Captain Thuy.

362
00:26:38,363 --> 00:26:41,232
What are your analyses?

363
00:26:41,232 --> 00:26:44,636
- We recovered three bullets from the body, sir.

364
00:26:44,636 --> 00:26:46,271
They were all US-issued.

365
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:48,139
- Well, I don't think that proves anything.

366
00:26:48,139 --> 00:26:52,043
We all know the VC have plenty of US-made firearms.

367
00:26:52,043 --> 00:26:56,047
- I beg the colonel's pardon, but being Major Vo's adjutant,

368
00:26:56,047 --> 00:26:59,050
I am well aware of the fact that for months now

369
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:02,354
you and your men have been persecuting him relentlessly.

370
00:27:03,688 --> 00:27:06,391
- Just what are you proposing?

371
00:27:06,391 --> 00:27:08,059
- I'd like to take ballistics of every sidearm

372
00:27:08,059 --> 00:27:10,195
of every man in this CP, sir.

373
00:27:10,195 --> 00:27:13,298
- No way, Captain Thuy, no fucking way.

374
00:27:14,866 --> 00:27:16,401
- In that case, colonel, if you don't mind,

375
00:27:16,401 --> 00:27:18,937
I'll take my request to MACV.

376
00:27:18,937 --> 00:27:21,539
- Go ahead, be my guest.

377
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:23,541
They'll laugh in your little brown face.

378
00:27:23,541 --> 00:27:27,612
- You know, Thuy, VC activity in Tay Ninh has dropped off

379
00:27:27,612 --> 00:27:30,949
85% since Major Vo's untimely demise.

380
00:27:30,949 --> 00:27:33,718
Everybody knew Vo was a double agent.

381
00:27:33,718 --> 00:27:35,754
The VC drained him of all the information they had

382
00:27:35,754 --> 00:27:37,422
and finished him off, that's all.

383
00:27:37,422 --> 00:27:39,524
- That sort of an allegation could never stand up

384
00:27:39,524 --> 00:27:41,826
in an American court of law, you know that, sir.

385
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:44,562
And even if he was guilty of what you said he did,

386
00:27:44,562 --> 00:27:46,564
he still deserved due process.

387
00:27:46,564 --> 00:27:47,966
Right now it all seems nothing

388
00:27:47,966 --> 00:27:50,368
but an execution doesn't it, colonel?

389
00:27:50,368 --> 00:27:54,172
- You listen to me, chief of police

390
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:56,541
pops a VC in the head right in the streets

391
00:27:56,541 --> 00:27:58,677
of Saigon in front of God, the TV cameras,

392
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:00,812
and everybody, and you come complaining to me?

393
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:06,084
I suggest you drop this, that is my best advice.

394
00:28:06,084 --> 00:28:07,118
- Yes, sir.

395
00:28:18,463 --> 00:28:20,131
- What do you think?

396
00:28:20,131 --> 00:28:21,599
- God, he's bluffing.

397
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:24,335
Anyway, they'd never take his word over mine.

398
00:28:28,673 --> 00:28:31,176
(train whistle blowing)

399
00:28:31,176 --> 00:28:33,678
(tense music)

400
00:30:46,878 --> 00:30:49,681
(massive booming)

401
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:54,586
(breaks squeaking)

402
00:30:54,586 --> 00:30:57,622
(explosions booming)

403
00:31:02,727 --> 00:31:04,896
(tense music)

404
00:31:04,896 --> 00:31:07,565
(rapid gunfire)

405
00:31:20,945 --> 00:31:23,014
(booming)

406
00:31:23,014 --> 00:31:25,683
- [Ski] Shit, they're behind us.

407
00:31:29,254 --> 00:31:31,122
- Let's move.

408
00:31:31,122 --> 00:31:33,791
(rapid gunfire)

409
00:31:35,827 --> 00:31:37,695
(shouting)

410
00:31:37,695 --> 00:31:40,365
(rapid gunfire)

411
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:46,371
(speaking in foreign language)

412
00:31:46,371 --> 00:31:48,506
(booming)

413
00:31:49,641 --> 00:31:51,075
(rapid gunfire)

414
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:53,378
(screaming)

415
00:31:58,816 --> 00:32:00,885
(gunfire)

416
00:32:05,523 --> 00:32:09,427
(shouting in foreign language)

417
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:21,639
- Cap, those bastards are everywhere.

418
00:32:21,639 --> 00:32:24,309
(rapid gunfire)

419
00:32:29,414 --> 00:32:32,417
(shouting in foreign language)

420
00:32:32,417 --> 00:32:33,985
- Let's move.

421
00:32:33,985 --> 00:32:34,819
Go.

422
00:32:35,753 --> 00:32:38,423
(rapid gunfire)

423
00:32:43,928 --> 00:32:45,863
(booming)

424
00:32:45,863 --> 00:32:48,533
(rapid gunfire)

425
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:56,974
(shouting in foreign language)

426
00:32:56,974 --> 00:32:57,842
- Let's go.

427
00:33:02,914 --> 00:33:04,882
(booming)

428
00:33:04,882 --> 00:33:09,053
(shouting in foreign language)

429
00:33:09,053 --> 00:33:11,089
(rapid gunfire)

430
00:33:11,089 --> 00:33:13,257
(booming)

431
00:33:27,372 --> 00:33:28,439
- Spread out.

432
00:33:29,307 --> 00:33:31,809
(tense music)

433
00:33:34,746 --> 00:33:35,580
- Sheriff.

434
00:33:47,291 --> 00:33:51,229
(shouting in foreign language)

435
00:33:53,765 --> 00:33:56,434
(rapid gunfire)

436
00:34:02,974 --> 00:34:06,010
(shrieking)

437
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:08,679
(rapid gunfire)

438
00:34:17,655 --> 00:34:19,791
(shouting)

439
00:34:19,791 --> 00:34:20,725
- Move out.

440
00:34:22,927 --> 00:34:25,596
(rapid gunfire)

441
00:34:30,334 --> 00:34:31,302
- [Bloomquist] You all right, captain?

442
00:34:31,302 --> 00:34:33,204
- Later, let's hoof it.

443
00:34:34,272 --> 00:34:39,010
(shouting in foreign language)

444
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:40,878
(rapid gunfire)

445
00:34:40,878 --> 00:34:43,114
(grunting)

446
00:34:58,663 --> 00:35:00,231
- Hold up, hold up.

447
00:35:01,532 --> 00:35:02,467
Bloomquist.

448
00:35:03,634 --> 00:35:05,136
Bloomquist, he was right beside me.

449
00:35:05,136 --> 00:35:07,572
(gunfire and screaming)

450
00:35:07,572 --> 00:35:08,840
- They're torturing him.

451
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:11,576
Goddammit, they're torturing him.

452
00:35:12,643 --> 00:35:14,979
(screaming)

453
00:35:24,322 --> 00:35:26,491
(gunfire)

454
00:35:36,501 --> 00:35:38,803
- [Bloomquist] Help.

455
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:41,138
(screaming)

456
00:35:58,623 --> 00:36:00,424
- We gotta pull this down, Troop.

457
00:36:00,424 --> 00:36:02,026
We can't let 'em get away with this.

458
00:36:02,026 --> 00:36:02,860
- Hold on.

459
00:36:03,928 --> 00:36:05,596
Lay down some smoke.

460
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:09,834
(screaming and gunfire)

461
00:36:16,274 --> 00:36:17,942
- [Bloomquist] Help.

462
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:24,849
(screaming)

463
00:36:31,289 --> 00:36:32,123
Help.

464
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:42,366
- Go.

465
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:43,801
Cover him.

466
00:36:43,801 --> 00:36:45,970
(gunfire)

467
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:05,690
(rapid gunfire)

468
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:19,136
(shouting in foreign language)

469
00:37:31,816 --> 00:37:34,051
(shouting)

470
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,242
- Hold your fire.

471
00:37:58,242 --> 00:37:59,343
- Cease fire.

472
00:38:11,689 --> 00:38:13,024
- Sergeant Park.

473
00:38:18,029 --> 00:38:19,430
(speaking in foreign language)

474
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:22,366
(speaking in foreign language)

475
00:38:22,366 --> 00:38:25,469
- Holy shit, they're gonna eat us.

476
00:38:27,238 --> 00:38:30,141
- No, if they wanted us dead we'd be dead already.

477
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:34,078
(speaking in foreign language)

478
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:37,248
It's okay, they're friendly.

479
00:38:38,849 --> 00:38:40,618
(speaking in foreign language)

480
00:38:40,618 --> 00:38:41,852
- What'd he say?

481
00:38:41,852 --> 00:38:43,754
- He said, "We have to bury the dead."

482
00:38:51,062 --> 00:38:52,363
- What about the kid here?

483
00:38:58,302 --> 00:38:59,136
- Bury him too.

484
00:39:02,473 --> 00:39:05,042
(somber music)

485
00:39:39,176 --> 00:39:43,114
(shouting in foreign language)

486
00:40:11,542 --> 00:40:13,477
- Sergeant Park.

487
00:40:13,477 --> 00:40:16,547
(speaking in foreign language)

488
00:40:16,547 --> 00:40:17,882
- Ask her who she is.

489
00:40:17,882 --> 00:40:19,984
- That's all right, I speak English.

490
00:40:19,984 --> 00:40:21,585
I'm Waranya.

491
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:23,087
- Waranya?

492
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:23,921
- Yes.

493
00:40:25,122 --> 00:40:26,657
Have your men rest in our huts.

494
00:40:27,725 --> 00:40:29,226
- Okay, thank you.

495
00:40:33,697 --> 00:40:36,100
- We don't see Americans here often.

496
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,968
What are you doing here, are you lost?

497
00:40:39,503 --> 00:40:41,305
- Yeah, you might say that.

498
00:40:41,305 --> 00:40:43,908
We got in a firefight with some NVA regulars.

499
00:40:43,908 --> 00:40:45,843
Got a bit sidetracked.

500
00:40:45,843 --> 00:40:47,411
- We don't have much to offer,

501
00:40:47,411 --> 00:40:49,547
but we'll do what we can for you and your men.

502
00:40:49,547 --> 00:40:50,514
- I appreciate that.

503
00:40:53,651 --> 00:40:56,720
- What do we do now, Troop, go back to Tay Ninh or what?

504
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:01,292
- Well, the next contact's at zero hour.

505
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,929
We'll see what the colonel thinks then.

506
00:41:06,997 --> 00:41:09,300
In the meantime, the NVA knows we're out here.

507
00:41:11,502 --> 00:41:13,037
(groaning)

508
00:41:13,037 --> 00:41:15,406
- It's a fucking hardball world, ladies.

509
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:19,176
- We better set up for the night.

510
00:41:19,176 --> 00:41:23,180
Ski, take ASP, set up a defensive perimeter

511
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:25,282
at the edge of the village.

512
00:41:25,282 --> 00:41:26,383
I'll come out and relieve you at--

513
00:41:26,383 --> 00:41:28,285
- That's not necessary, captain.

514
00:41:28,285 --> 00:41:30,254
We've got our own eyes in the jungle.

515
00:41:30,254 --> 00:41:32,523
And believe me, we'll have an ample warning

516
00:41:32,523 --> 00:41:34,158
about any unwelcome guests.

517
00:41:37,561 --> 00:41:40,231
(ominous tones)

518
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:13,364
- Husband?

519
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:14,865
- My brother.

520
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:15,699
This is for you.

521
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:19,870
- Thank you.

522
00:42:24,942 --> 00:42:26,076
- Bitter?

523
00:42:26,076 --> 00:42:26,911
- No, no.

524
00:42:30,347 --> 00:42:31,582
Maybe a little.

525
00:42:32,816 --> 00:42:34,952
Where did you learn to speak English?

526
00:42:34,952 --> 00:42:36,220
- From the nuns.

527
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:37,321
I speak French too.

528
00:42:40,257 --> 00:42:43,761
- This is beautiful country around here.

529
00:42:43,761 --> 00:42:46,697
It's very quiet and serene.

530
00:42:50,334 --> 00:42:53,070
But your people, they seem so hostile.

531
00:42:54,538 --> 00:42:56,874
- We are a peaceful people,

532
00:42:56,874 --> 00:42:59,009
but we want the NVA out of our country.

533
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:02,413
Our own government won't even help us.

534
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:04,748
So we do what little we can when we can

535
00:43:05,683 --> 00:43:07,685
with our own limited resources.

536
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:11,855
- Do you realize what would happen if you got caught?

537
00:43:13,524 --> 00:43:15,593
- If they knew what we were up to,

538
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:17,428
they're gonna wipe us out any minute.

539
00:43:18,829 --> 00:43:23,434
I suppose that makes us very brave or very foolish.

540
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:26,170
- Well, there's nothing foolish

541
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:27,771
about fighting for your country.

542
00:43:29,306 --> 00:43:30,975
- My father would have disagreed.

543
00:43:32,142 --> 00:43:33,277
When he was our head man he'd

544
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:36,013
always say, "Fighting is primitive."

545
00:43:36,013 --> 00:43:38,916
He believed that education was the best way for us.

546
00:43:40,551 --> 00:43:41,452
- Where is he now?

547
00:43:42,553 --> 00:43:43,721
- The NVA killed him.

548
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:47,791
- I'm sorry.

549
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:50,060
Why did they kill him?

550
00:43:51,662 --> 00:43:54,565
- This village is near their supply station

551
00:43:54,565 --> 00:43:56,700
and objected in the use of our trails.

552
00:43:58,435 --> 00:43:59,937
- And they killed him for that?

553
00:44:01,338 --> 00:44:04,241
- He was executed in front of the entire village.

554
00:44:06,076 --> 00:44:07,745
They were making an example for anyone

555
00:44:07,745 --> 00:44:09,613
who interfered with their operations.

556
00:44:14,018 --> 00:44:18,522
- Waranya, do you know where the supply station is located?

557
00:44:18,522 --> 00:44:19,990
- Yes.

558
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:23,327
If we had the weapons and the manpower, we'd destroy it.

559
00:44:24,762 --> 00:44:27,898
But we're not strong enough and it's too well-guarded.

560
00:44:33,837 --> 00:44:37,741
(speaking in foreign language)

561
00:44:53,424 --> 00:44:55,025
- Eagle Dress, this is Red Hawk.

562
00:44:56,794 --> 00:44:58,362
Tracks are down, Eagle.

563
00:44:58,362 --> 00:45:00,064
- Outstanding.

564
00:45:00,064 --> 00:45:02,700
Son, you're gonna get a case of beer for this.

565
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:04,168
Where are you?

566
00:45:04,168 --> 00:45:08,305
- We're at a local motel at 9119, considering our next move.

567
00:45:08,305 --> 00:45:09,740
- Fly home, Red Hawk.

568
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:11,875
- Negative, but thanks for the invite, Eagle.

569
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:13,210
I got my nose on the main dump.

570
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:15,512
We're going for it tomorrow at dark.

571
00:45:15,512 --> 00:45:18,449
- Maximize enemy casualties, Hawk.

572
00:45:18,449 --> 00:45:20,284
I wish to hell I was with you.

573
00:45:22,119 --> 00:45:24,421
(shouting in foreign language)

574
00:45:24,421 --> 00:45:27,091
(ominous tones)

575
00:45:28,692 --> 00:45:29,526
- [Jeff] NVA?

576
00:45:29,526 --> 00:45:30,961
- [Waranya] Yes.

577
00:45:30,961 --> 00:45:32,729
- All right, spread out, take cover.

578
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:38,302
(speaking in foreign language)

579
00:45:42,372 --> 00:45:45,976
(shouting in foreign language)

580
00:45:45,976 --> 00:45:48,479
(tense music)

581
00:46:22,379 --> 00:46:24,381
(speaking in foreign language)

582
00:46:24,381 --> 00:46:26,049
(speaking in foreign language)

583
00:46:26,049 --> 00:46:27,551
(speaking in foreign language)

584
00:46:27,551 --> 00:46:29,019
(speaking in foreign language)

585
00:46:29,019 --> 00:46:32,656
(speaking in foreign language)

586
00:46:32,656 --> 00:46:35,159
(tense music)

587
00:46:45,536 --> 00:46:49,439
(speaking in foreign language)

588
00:47:39,256 --> 00:47:40,524
(speaking in foreign language)

589
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:42,226
(speaking in foreign language)

590
00:47:42,226 --> 00:47:46,163
(speaking in foreign language)

591
00:47:52,970 --> 00:47:55,472
(speaking in foreign language)

592
00:47:55,472 --> 00:47:59,409
(speaking in foreign language)

593
00:48:13,657 --> 00:48:14,925
- Don't play games with me, colonel,

594
00:48:14,925 --> 00:48:16,693
I know you ordered the murder of Tung Tran Vo

595
00:48:16,693 --> 00:48:18,161
and I intend to uncover it.

596
00:48:18,161 --> 00:48:20,397
- I didn't have anything to do with it, Thuy.

597
00:48:23,267 --> 00:48:24,401
What's this?

598
00:48:24,401 --> 00:48:26,770
- Chopper orders, sir.

599
00:48:26,770 --> 00:48:29,840
The flight plans don't agree with your paperwork.

600
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:31,808
I believe you sent Holland to Cambodia.

601
00:48:34,878 --> 00:48:39,783
- Look, the NVA abandoned Firebase Lennox two days ago.

602
00:48:39,783 --> 00:48:42,286
Hoffman was just going back to check it out.

603
00:48:42,286 --> 00:48:44,721
- You don't have to deny it, colonel,

604
00:48:44,721 --> 00:48:46,456
we do have an agent in the field.

605
00:48:47,724 --> 00:48:50,260
Colonel Wiggins, I can understand your desire

606
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:53,263
to act outside normal operating procedures,

607
00:48:53,263 --> 00:48:55,098
but it can sometimes lead to regret.

608
00:48:56,466 --> 00:48:58,735
I'd hate to see the colonel disgrace himself, sir.

609
00:49:01,571 --> 00:49:06,243
- Listen, you piss-tube gook-faced asshole son of a bitch,

610
00:49:06,243 --> 00:49:09,446
I am tired of sweet-talking you.

611
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:12,482
- That's the last time I'll take that from you, sir.

612
00:49:14,251 --> 00:49:15,652
- Pick a finger.

613
00:49:21,191 --> 00:49:22,025
Think he's a red?

614
00:49:24,094 --> 00:49:26,396
- Negative, I checked him out thoroughly.

615
00:49:26,396 --> 00:49:27,764
Hell, he went to Annapolis.

616
00:49:30,267 --> 00:49:32,469
- Well, keep checking.

617
00:49:45,582 --> 00:49:48,085
(tense music)

618
00:50:05,736 --> 00:50:07,304
(rapid gunfire)

619
00:50:07,304 --> 00:50:10,240
(tires screeching)

620
00:50:11,241 --> 00:50:13,410
(gunfire)

621
00:50:17,114 --> 00:50:18,648
(speaking in foreign language)

622
00:50:18,648 --> 00:50:21,418
(gunfire)

623
00:50:21,418 --> 00:50:24,087
(rapid gunfire)

624
00:50:37,501 --> 00:50:39,736
(grunting)

625
00:50:41,872 --> 00:50:43,774
- Go on, get outta here.

626
00:50:43,774 --> 00:50:44,574
- No way.

627
00:50:48,678 --> 00:50:50,781
- Look, we don't got a chance.

628
00:50:50,781 --> 00:50:51,681
Get outta here.

629
00:50:55,585 --> 00:50:57,721
(gunfire)

630
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:02,058
(grunting)

631
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:18,408
(gunfire)

632
00:51:22,712 --> 00:51:25,382
(rapid gunfire)

633
00:51:54,377 --> 00:51:57,581
- I'm sorry, sir, I know Lazaro meant a lot to you.

634
00:52:02,419 --> 00:52:04,921
- They're trying to get to me.

635
00:52:07,057 --> 00:52:09,059
They think they can hurt me with this...

636
00:52:10,427 --> 00:52:11,261
Well they

637
00:52:14,431 --> 00:52:15,265
can't.

638
00:52:32,215 --> 00:52:33,650
Business as usual, gentlemen.

639
00:52:42,659 --> 00:52:43,560
- [Troops] Colonel.

640
00:52:45,128 --> 00:52:45,962
Sir.

641
00:52:48,965 --> 00:52:51,768
- Now stay here, it wouldn't do any good.

642
00:53:01,411 --> 00:53:03,013
- That's their supply station.

643
00:53:03,013 --> 00:53:06,016
They stockpiled it about a week ago.

644
00:53:13,957 --> 00:53:16,459
(tense music)

645
00:54:24,995 --> 00:54:27,664
(rapid gunfire)

646
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:38,241

648
00:54:40,343 --> 00:54:42,846

649
00:54:42,846 --> 00:54:45,515

650
00:55:13,677 --> 00:55:16,346

652
00:55:37,734 --> 00:55:40,070

653
00:55:46,109 --> 00:55:48,778

660
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:50,907
(rapid gunfire)

661
00:56:58,081 --> 00:56:58,915
- Here.

662
00:57:02,418 --> 00:57:05,088
(rapid gunfire)

663
00:57:09,559 --> 00:57:11,060
(grunting)

664
00:57:11,060 --> 00:57:13,696
(explosion booms)

665
00:57:13,696 --> 00:57:14,531
Yeah.

666
00:57:49,699 --> 00:57:51,835
- They are all empty.

667
00:57:51,835 --> 00:57:53,503
- They knew we were coming.

668
00:57:53,503 --> 00:57:55,104
- That damn frigging train ambush

669
00:57:55,104 --> 00:57:57,373
must've tipped 'em off to move the stuff.

670
00:57:57,373 --> 00:57:58,875
- [Jeff] We're gonna have to find it.

671
00:58:01,878 --> 00:58:03,046
- Maybe he can help us.

672
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:06,549
(gurgling)

673
00:58:08,051 --> 00:58:11,955
(shouting in foreign language)

674
00:58:14,791 --> 00:58:17,627
(heavy breathing)

675
00:58:20,730 --> 00:58:24,634
(speaking in foreign language)

676
00:58:27,837 --> 00:58:30,807
- I know the place he means.

677
00:58:30,807 --> 00:58:31,908
- Is it far from here?

678
00:58:33,076 --> 00:58:35,712
- It's about a half a day, or even longer.

679
00:58:38,948 --> 00:58:40,817
- All right, we'll leave at midnight.

680
00:58:42,085 --> 00:58:43,786
- There's something else.

681
00:58:43,786 --> 00:58:47,523
The NVA commander ordered American POWs be brought in.

682
00:58:47,523 --> 00:58:48,424
- Human shields.

683
00:58:51,594 --> 00:58:53,062
(sighing)

684
00:58:53,062 --> 00:58:54,330
- I can take you to the place.

685
00:58:54,330 --> 00:58:55,598
- No.

686
00:58:55,598 --> 00:58:57,901
- I have to be with you when you destroy them.

687
00:58:59,269 --> 00:59:01,537
- Your people need you here.

688
00:59:02,939 --> 00:59:05,708
(peaceful music)

689
00:59:46,049 --> 00:59:48,718

(shouting)

691
01:00:10,073 --> 01:00:10,907
Ski.

692
01:00:12,909 --> 01:00:13,743
Tower.

693
01:00:16,512 --> 01:00:17,513
Take it out.

694
01:00:22,118 --> 01:00:22,952
Sheriff.

695
01:00:34,664 --> 01:00:38,601
(speaking in foreign language)

696
01:00:40,003 --> 01:00:42,638
- [Prisoner] Food, food, please.

697
01:00:45,508 --> 01:00:47,744
(shouting)

698
01:00:51,414 --> 01:00:53,616

(thrilling music)

702
01:01:06,229 --> 01:01:07,397
- [Soldier] Get down, get down.

703
01:01:07,397 --> 01:01:08,998
Get down, get down.

704
01:01:10,233 --> 01:01:12,902

(thrilling music)

709
01:01:54,977 --> 01:01:56,579
- [Prisoner] Hey, get us out of here, come on.

710
01:01:56,579 --> 01:02:01,484
Get us outta here.

711
01:02:05,621 --> 01:02:08,291
(rapid gunfire)

712
01:02:14,864 --> 01:02:16,566

(rapid gunfire)

714
01:02:25,174 --> 01:02:26,008

716
01:02:31,614 --> 01:02:33,082

720
01:02:46,028 --> 01:02:46,863

726
01:03:32,108 --> 01:03:32,942
Bingo.

730
01:04:20,957 --> 01:04:22,491

01:06:13,602 --> 01:06:15,771
(booming)

739
01:06:21,744 --> 01:06:23,913
(booming)

740
01:06:36,692 --> 01:06:37,960
Get back, back!

741
01:06:45,267 --> 01:06:48,471
(explosions booming)

742
01:06:48,471 --> 01:06:51,374
(triumphant music)

743
01:07:20,469 --> 01:07:22,738
(knocking)

744
01:07:25,074 --> 01:07:26,809
- Sir, someone here to see you.

745
01:07:27,710 --> 01:07:28,644
- Show him in.

746
01:07:32,615 --> 01:07:34,417
What can I do for you, Captain Thuy?

747
01:07:57,039 --> 01:07:58,407
- How'd you get in here?

748
01:07:58,407 --> 01:08:00,276
- Your men are outside.

749
01:08:00,276 --> 01:08:01,410
We have them detained.

750
01:08:16,192 --> 01:08:17,960
I wanted a word with you alone.

751
01:08:20,830 --> 01:08:24,433
It's your arrest warrant, counter-signed by General O'Neal.

752
01:08:26,469 --> 01:08:29,371
You are to be court marshaled for unauthorized

753
01:08:29,371 --> 01:08:31,907
cross-border activities and the murder of Major Vo.

754
01:08:36,178 --> 01:08:38,681
- The charges are totally unjustified.

755
01:08:40,015 --> 01:08:41,817
- We have an eyewitness.

756
01:08:41,817 --> 01:08:44,487
He identified Lieutenant Lazaro as the trigger man,

757
01:08:44,487 --> 01:08:47,089
no doubt acting on your orders.

758
01:08:48,224 --> 01:08:50,559
- VC eyewitness?

759
01:08:50,559 --> 01:08:52,127
- His statement has been corroborated

760
01:08:52,127 --> 01:08:54,363
by the ballistic test on Lazaro's gun.

761
01:08:58,634 --> 01:09:03,372
- Lieutenant Lazaro was a splendid young officer.

762
01:09:03,372 --> 01:09:07,009
I will not have you impugning his memory.

763
01:09:07,009 --> 01:09:11,180
- Colonel Wiggins, you cannot operate a private army

764
01:09:11,180 --> 01:09:13,816
unchecked, unscrupulously beyond the limits

765
01:09:13,816 --> 01:09:15,751
of civilized military conduct.

766
01:09:17,186 --> 01:09:18,454
Do you think you are God?

767
01:09:27,129 --> 01:09:31,667
- You piss on his sacrifice by taking the word

768
01:09:31,667 --> 01:09:35,504
of a lousy asshole Communist motherfucker, huh?

769
01:09:38,807 --> 01:09:40,509
(gunshot)

770
01:09:40,509 --> 01:09:42,111
(screaming)

771
01:09:42,111 --> 01:09:44,613
- Stay here, you come with me.

772
01:09:45,481 --> 01:09:47,750
(grunting)

773
01:10:06,902 --> 01:10:09,071
(gunfire)

774
01:10:12,208 --> 01:10:14,877
(rapid gunfire)

775
01:10:20,282 --> 01:10:21,116
(grunting)

776
01:10:21,116 --> 01:10:22,518
(rapid gunfire)

777
01:10:22,518 --> 01:10:24,787
(grunting)

778
01:10:26,956 --> 01:10:28,190
- Motherfucker.

779
01:10:29,725 --> 01:10:31,260
- Hold it right there.

780
01:10:31,260 --> 01:10:33,929
(rapid gunfire)

781
01:10:35,064 --> 01:10:38,033
- All right, men, it's time to saddle up.

782
01:10:38,033 --> 01:10:39,702
- Where we going, pappy?

783
01:10:39,702 --> 01:10:42,171
- A job that needs to be done.

784
01:10:47,543 --> 01:10:49,778
(cheering)

785
01:11:05,628 --> 01:11:08,797
(helicopter whirring)

786
01:11:11,367 --> 01:11:13,969
(somber music)

787
01:11:50,172 --> 01:11:51,807
Year of the Monkey.

788
01:11:51,807 --> 01:11:53,676
(rapid gunfire)

789
01:11:53,676 --> 01:11:55,277
Year of the fucking Monkey.

790
01:11:57,746 --> 01:11:59,281
- Okay, I'll handle this.

791
01:12:00,282 --> 01:12:03,185
- Hey, good to see you, son.

792
01:12:05,154 --> 01:12:06,422
- What are you doing here?

793
01:12:06,422 --> 01:12:07,623
- Come for your report.

794
01:12:09,525 --> 01:12:11,393
- We blew the dump this morning, sir.

795
01:12:11,393 --> 01:12:12,528
- Yeah.

796
01:12:12,528 --> 01:12:14,296
Hey, congratulations.

797
01:12:15,464 --> 01:12:18,400
Looks like you put a damper on these gooks.

798
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:19,835
Disarm those men, troop.

799
01:12:23,872 --> 01:12:25,808
- Hey, wait a minute, what are you doing?

800
01:12:25,808 --> 01:12:28,143
- Line 'em up over there with the other ones.

801
01:12:28,143 --> 01:12:28,977
Him too.

802
01:12:30,612 --> 01:12:32,114
- No wait, that's Sergeant Park, he's on our side.

803
01:12:32,114 --> 01:12:33,215
He's your man.

804
01:12:34,883 --> 01:12:36,552
- All I see is a bunch of gooks.

805
01:12:44,526 --> 01:12:47,296
(chuckling)

806
01:12:47,296 --> 01:12:49,365
Wanna hear something fucking hilarious?

807
01:12:53,102 --> 01:12:53,902
Come here.

808
01:13:03,779 --> 01:13:07,015
Listen, Jeff, I got some bad news for you.

809
01:13:08,517 --> 01:13:13,122
Somewhere in this camp, somebody is working

810
01:13:13,122 --> 01:13:14,790
for the South Vietnamese.

811
01:13:16,225 --> 01:13:20,028
Now that is not good because if you can talk to the South,

812
01:13:21,029 --> 01:13:22,564
then you can talk to the North.

813
01:13:24,233 --> 01:13:25,667
Know what I mean?

814
01:13:27,269 --> 01:13:28,103
(grunting)

815
01:13:28,103 --> 01:13:29,805
(chuckling)

816
01:13:29,805 --> 01:13:32,708
- Wiggins, Wiggins, Park's been with us all the way.

817
01:13:32,708 --> 01:13:34,410
We couldn't have done it without him.

818
01:13:34,410 --> 01:13:35,978
- You NVA huh, huh?

819
01:13:37,446 --> 01:13:38,547
You talk NVA?

820
01:13:41,283 --> 01:13:42,618
You NVA?

821
01:13:42,618 --> 01:13:43,786
Speak to me, Charlie.

822
01:13:43,786 --> 01:13:45,821
- Wiggins, Wiggins, knock it off.

823
01:13:46,955 --> 01:13:49,458
- Hey, poppy, look what I found over there.

824
01:13:54,530 --> 01:13:58,300
- Why don't we hear what she has to say about that.

825
01:13:58,300 --> 01:13:59,802
- It's my brother's.

826
01:13:59,802 --> 01:14:03,138
He keeps in touch with the South, we have a common enemy.

827
01:14:03,138 --> 01:14:04,473
(laughing)

828
01:14:04,473 --> 01:14:05,774
- The man's dead, Wiggins.

829
01:14:08,510 --> 01:14:12,447
He got killed this morning when we went to the ammo dump.

830
01:14:12,447 --> 01:14:14,850
- [Horace] You believe her?

831
01:14:14,850 --> 01:14:17,786
- Look, it's not too late.

832
01:14:17,786 --> 01:14:21,356
Let's go back to Tay Ninh, we'll work everything out.

833
01:14:24,393 --> 01:14:26,562
(gunshot)

834
01:14:30,065 --> 01:14:31,333
- They're all the same.

835
01:14:32,734 --> 01:14:35,304
The reason we came to this country,

836
01:14:35,304 --> 01:14:37,139
try to give it back to the people that own it.

837
01:14:37,139 --> 01:14:39,908
I mean, how the hell do you tell the difference?

838
01:14:41,810 --> 01:14:46,348
Well, if we can't tell which one of these ginks out here

839
01:14:46,348 --> 01:14:47,649
is the agent, I guess we'll just have to do 'em all.

840
01:14:54,022 --> 01:14:56,325
Payback for Lazaro.

841
01:14:56,325 --> 01:14:59,194
- Wiggins, these villagers, these people helped us.

842
01:14:59,194 --> 01:15:02,064
They're not gooks, they're people, good people.

843
01:15:03,465 --> 01:15:06,068
They're fighting for their country just like us.

844
01:15:06,068 --> 01:15:09,471
- Don't start going girl on me now, Jeff.

845
01:15:12,608 --> 01:15:13,942
The enemy's all around us.

846
01:15:15,110 --> 01:15:17,412
Look at 'em, they got no feelings.

847
01:15:20,949 --> 01:15:22,351
- They hurt just like we do.

848
01:15:23,952 --> 01:15:26,755
- Shut the fuck up, Holland.

849
01:15:26,755 --> 01:15:28,957
Act like you got a pair.

850
01:15:28,957 --> 01:15:30,792
These people aren't even human,

851
01:15:30,792 --> 01:15:33,395
they're just a bunch of lying asshole motherfuckers.

852
01:15:35,364 --> 01:15:37,499
- You've lost it, haven't you?

853
01:15:37,499 --> 01:15:39,401
You've really fucking lost it.

854
01:15:39,401 --> 01:15:40,569
- Shut him up.

855
01:15:42,571 --> 01:15:44,139
Don't sweat it, son,

856
01:15:45,307 --> 01:15:48,010
we'll have this village mopped up in a flash.

857
01:15:49,111 --> 01:15:52,981
It'll be over before you know it.

858
01:15:52,981 --> 01:15:53,949
Year of the Monkey.

859
01:15:57,119 --> 01:16:00,422
(rapid gunfire)

860
01:16:00,422 --> 01:16:01,557
- Wiggins, no!

861
01:16:04,293 --> 01:16:06,762
- I'm doing what they wanted me to do.

862
01:16:06,762 --> 01:16:09,865
(screaming)

863
01:16:09,865 --> 01:16:12,601
What they didn't have the guts to do themselves.

864
01:16:12,601 --> 01:16:15,270
(rapid gunfire)

865
01:16:23,512 --> 01:16:26,014
All right, cease fire.

866
01:16:26,014 --> 01:16:27,349
Cease fire, off.

867
01:16:37,626 --> 01:16:39,394
You like the girl, don't you?

868
01:16:43,799 --> 01:16:46,768
Cut the rest of 'em loose.

869
01:16:46,768 --> 01:16:47,602
- Move.

870
01:16:48,770 --> 01:16:50,005
Get outta here.

871
01:16:50,005 --> 01:16:52,007
- Tell them to send a message to Charlie.

872
01:16:53,842 --> 01:16:56,678
The beast is in the bush and he's hungry.

873
01:17:02,451 --> 01:17:03,685
(sighing)

874
01:17:03,685 --> 01:17:07,055
You'll accept it now, son, now that it's over.

875
01:17:10,092 --> 01:17:13,695
All right, we're moving outta here.

876
01:17:13,695 --> 01:17:15,964
We're gonna go hit and run all the way to Laos

877
01:17:15,964 --> 01:17:17,599
where we'll do the most good.

878
01:17:17,599 --> 01:17:19,101
You with us, Holland?

879
01:17:19,101 --> 01:17:21,103
- What the hell are you gonna do when you run out of ammo?

880
01:17:21,103 --> 01:17:24,740
- We'll steal it from Charlie just like he does from us.

881
01:17:24,740 --> 01:17:27,409
We're gonna fight this war the way it oughta be fought,

882
01:17:27,409 --> 01:17:30,345
the way it shoulda been fought at the very beginning.

883
01:17:30,345 --> 01:17:35,050
- Wiggins, no!

884
01:17:35,050 --> 01:17:38,120
(clicking)

885
01:17:38,120 --> 01:17:40,355
(grunting)

886
01:17:42,724 --> 01:17:44,893
(gunfire)

887
01:17:47,062 --> 01:17:49,331
(grunting)

888
01:17:52,034 --> 01:17:54,202
(gunfire)

889
01:17:56,171 --> 01:17:58,840
(rapid gunfire)

890
01:18:01,043 --> 01:18:02,978
(tense tones)

891
01:18:02,978 --> 01:18:05,414
(whimpering)

892
01:18:20,495 --> 01:18:22,631
Wiggins, it'll never work.

893
01:18:24,332 --> 01:18:26,735
(whimpering)

894
01:18:41,850 --> 01:18:42,718
- [Ropes] You okay?

895
01:18:42,718 --> 01:18:43,552
- Yeah.

896
01:18:45,287 --> 01:18:48,123
(thrilling music)

897
01:19:11,146 --> 01:19:11,980
(gunshot)

898
01:19:11,980 --> 01:19:14,249
(grunting)

899
01:19:26,461 --> 01:19:29,030
(somber music)

900
01:19:35,270 --> 01:19:38,173
(sobbing)

901
01:19:38,173 --> 01:19:40,442
- What happened to Wiggins?

902
01:19:42,777 --> 01:19:43,779
- He's dead.

903
01:19:45,680 --> 01:19:47,449
Let's go home, Ropes.

904
01:19:48,450 --> 01:19:51,052
(somber music)

905
01:20:12,607 --> 01:20:14,843
(growling)

906
01:20:24,953 --> 01:20:27,956
(exotic rock music)
