9
00:01:15,531 --> 00:01:16,520
Lots of snow!

10
00:01:20,904 --> 00:01:24,601
Terrific! Not melted yet!

11
00:01:32,485 --> 00:01:36,251
We came for a memorial service.
Not to go skiing.

12
00:01:36,656 --> 00:01:38,920
Mama, you also want to ski, right?

13
00:01:41,996 --> 00:01:45,591
0h, I want to ski!
I'm dying to ski!

14
00:01:46,635 --> 00:01:49,103
I can't wait to see Yoshimi.

15
00:01:49,272 --> 00:01:52,139
Spring vacation's great.
No homework.

16
00:02:00,552 --> 00:02:03,248
I thought you grew out of that.

17
00:02:03,488 --> 00:02:04,785
My lucky charm.

18
00:02:05,825 --> 00:02:09,226
It's so cute...
Give it to me.

19
00:02:09,395 --> 00:02:10,225
Nope.

20
00:03:07,163 --> 00:03:08,323
Look out!

21
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:49,203
Heisuke Sugita
Naoko
Monami

22
00:04:07,835 --> 00:04:10,360
Rescued passengers
are badly injured.

23
00:04:10,671 --> 00:04:13,401
Most in critical condition.

24
00:04:21,317 --> 00:04:23,114
The latest report...

25
00:04:23,319 --> 00:04:27,619
Regarding the mother and
daughter in the hospital...

26
00:04:27,891 --> 00:04:29,381
They have been identified as,

27
00:04:29,593 --> 00:04:32,391
Mrs. Sugita and her daughter.

28
00:04:32,664 --> 00:04:36,657
The two women brought to
this hospital...

29
00:04:36,969 --> 00:04:38,561
have been identified.

30
00:04:38,804 --> 00:04:41,272
Their family name is Sugita.

31
00:04:41,575 --> 00:04:43,805
We'll be going now.

32
00:04:53,389 --> 00:04:56,449
Try to shave clean.

33
00:04:57,861 --> 00:04:58,793
Bye, now!

34
00:05:26,695 --> 00:05:29,493
I'm Sugita.
Where's my wife and daughter?

35
00:05:30,065 --> 00:05:33,501
Sugita? The trauma
section upstairs.

36
00:05:34,837 --> 00:05:36,702
The trauma section.

37
00:05:38,742 --> 00:05:39,470
Heisuke!

38
00:05:39,643 --> 00:05:42,203
I don't know what to say...

39
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:45,144
If only I hadn't asked
them to come...

40
00:05:45,917 --> 00:05:47,316
Doctor, doctor...

41
00:05:49,655 --> 00:05:50,815
Mr. Sugita?

42
00:05:51,023 --> 00:05:51,921
Yes.

43
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:54,349
Will they make it?

44
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:04,364
I'm afraid it's very critical.

45
00:06:05,874 --> 00:06:08,809
You mean my wife...
or my daughter?

46
00:06:12,682 --> 00:06:13,842
Both of them.

47
00:06:21,826 --> 00:06:23,726
Doctor, the mother's VF!

48
00:06:26,465 --> 00:06:27,489
Bosumin!

49
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,927
Hold on! What?

50
00:06:32,806 --> 00:06:33,397
What?

51
00:06:34,941 --> 00:06:35,771
Monami?

52
00:06:36,643 --> 00:06:37,541
Don't worry.

53
00:06:39,147 --> 00:06:40,307
She's right next to you.

54
00:06:41,749 --> 00:06:43,216
Nurse... Help me.

55
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:56,959
Naoko!

56
00:06:57,768 --> 00:06:58,632
Hold on!

57
00:07:02,374 --> 00:07:03,068
Naoko!

58
00:07:04,242 --> 00:07:04,936
Naoko!

59
00:07:06,145 --> 00:07:06,736
Naoko!

60
00:07:12,386 --> 00:07:13,410
Naoko!

61
00:07:14,154 --> 00:07:15,121
Mama...

62
00:07:16,057 --> 00:07:17,081
This way please.

63
00:07:21,831 --> 00:07:22,798
Naoko...

64
00:08:25,872 --> 00:08:26,804
Monami...

65
00:08:30,344 --> 00:08:31,208
Monami.

66
00:08:32,546 --> 00:08:33,706
You're awake...

67
00:08:39,255 --> 00:08:39,880
What?

68
00:08:46,563 --> 00:08:48,258
Am I... dead?

69
00:08:50,468 --> 00:08:51,230
Monami.

70
00:08:52,804 --> 00:08:54,237
You're alive!

71
00:08:55,473 --> 00:08:58,442
I'll get the doctor!

72
00:08:59,745 --> 00:09:00,973
Wait, Heisuke.

73
00:09:07,021 --> 00:09:09,717
It's me, Naoko.

74
00:09:10,525 --> 00:09:11,219
What?

75
00:09:15,698 --> 00:09:16,722
What are you saying?

76
00:09:18,401 --> 00:09:19,129
Monami.

77
00:09:21,805 --> 00:09:23,033
Heisuke...

78
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:27,268
I'm Naoko.

79
00:09:33,051 --> 00:09:39,082
- H i m i t s u -

80
00:09:41,161 --> 00:09:42,355
What are you saying?

81
00:09:43,764 --> 00:09:45,061
Are you all right, Monami?

82
00:09:46,601 --> 00:09:50,298
No.
I'm Naoko.

83
00:09:50,872 --> 00:09:51,964
Can't you see?

84
00:09:52,942 --> 00:09:55,342
No! It's impossible.

85
00:09:56,712 --> 00:09:58,805
I can't believe it myself.

86
00:10:01,485 --> 00:10:02,782
But it's true.

87
00:10:06,491 --> 00:10:08,857
Now, don't kid daddy.

88
00:10:09,294 --> 00:10:10,226
I'm not.

89
00:10:11,897 --> 00:10:12,693
No.

90
00:10:15,068 --> 00:10:20,165
Then, tell me about
the first date we had.

91
00:10:20,841 --> 00:10:23,810
We ate ice cream
at the Cape Lighthouse.

92
00:10:25,947 --> 00:10:26,845
And then?

93
00:10:29,217 --> 00:10:30,912
We went to Chinatown.

94
00:10:31,521 --> 00:10:34,513
You ate 5 dishes of noodles in soup.

95
00:10:36,226 --> 00:10:37,557
Different kinds of noodles.

96
00:10:39,196 --> 00:10:40,686
Also fried noodles.

97
00:10:45,136 --> 00:10:51,474
And do you remember the night
you spent at my place?

98
00:10:52,312 --> 00:10:53,108
Yes,

99
00:10:54,781 --> 00:10:55,873
It was winter.

100
00:10:56,616 --> 00:10:59,210
While we were doing it
you were so clumsy.

101
00:10:59,454 --> 00:11:01,752
You had a leg cramp.
A big commotion.

102
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,851
Tell me, are you still alive?

103
00:11:10,567 --> 00:11:11,363
Naoko...

104
00:11:13,436 --> 00:11:14,027
Naoko?

105
00:11:33,594 --> 00:11:36,825
Does it mean that Monami
is the one who is dead?

106
00:11:40,535 --> 00:11:44,027
I took over Monami's body.

107
00:11:56,487 --> 00:12:00,048
If it's possible to bring Monami
back...

108
00:12:00,492 --> 00:12:02,357
I'll do whatever it takes.

109
00:12:12,373 --> 00:12:13,601
For now...

110
00:12:15,009 --> 00:12:16,977
Better not tell anyone.

111
00:12:22,018 --> 00:12:23,178
Heisuke...

112
00:12:25,721 --> 00:12:27,689
What'll I do now?

113
00:12:48,181 --> 00:12:49,443
I'm home.

114
00:12:50,785 --> 00:12:53,345
Wow, what a mess.

115
00:12:54,121 --> 00:12:55,452
Heisuke, open the window.

116
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:25,451
It's pretty awkward.

117
00:14:07,575 --> 00:14:09,600
Heisuke, did you water them?

118
00:14:12,548 --> 00:14:13,378
Sometimes.

119
00:14:13,849 --> 00:14:14,941
I knew it.

120
00:14:16,118 --> 00:14:19,918
They're withering.
The poor things.

121
00:14:20,257 --> 00:14:21,952
Drink lots of water.

122
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:31,166
There!

123
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:34,770
Come on, pep up!

124
00:14:44,352 --> 00:14:45,842
Now you'll revive.

125
00:14:52,428 --> 00:14:54,862
Heisuke, come and help me.

126
00:15:08,714 --> 00:15:09,681
Heisuke...

127
00:15:12,218 --> 00:15:14,345
Am I in a dream?

128
00:15:42,354 --> 00:15:43,753
Will you be all right alone?

129
00:15:44,956 --> 00:15:46,082
I'll be fine.

130
00:15:51,264 --> 00:15:52,731
You missed some.

131
00:15:54,234 --> 00:15:55,428
So, you're Naoko.

132
00:15:55,803 --> 00:15:56,735
See you later.

133
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,907
I'll see you later.

134
00:16:25,104 --> 00:16:28,198
A little bland.

135
00:16:28,408 --> 00:16:33,311
But chief, we thought a mild
flavor would sell better.

136
00:16:33,481 --> 00:16:37,008
Chinese noodles must taste
good from the first bite.

137
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:41,615
So-called mild soy sauce
contains a lot of salt.

138
00:16:41,858 --> 00:16:42,654
Yes...

139
00:16:43,826 --> 00:16:46,158
It has a good broth flavor.

140
00:16:46,362 --> 00:16:47,329
A little more effort.

141
00:16:49,032 --> 00:16:49,964
And the noodles.

142
00:16:50,434 --> 00:16:51,833
I'm confident of that.

143
00:16:52,871 --> 00:16:56,830
I think the chief
looks pretty weary.

144
00:16:57,809 --> 00:16:59,436
After what happened,
of course.

145
00:17:09,857 --> 00:17:12,655
Come on! Get up!
You'll be late.

146
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:14,327
5 more minutes.

147
00:17:15,697 --> 00:17:17,961
No! Get up!

148
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,196
No!
I want to sleep more

149
00:17:21,604 --> 00:17:27,099
Get up right now.
You hear me?

150
00:17:27,811 --> 00:17:29,039
Stop it!

151
00:17:29,213 --> 00:17:31,272
I'll sleep with you.

152
00:17:51,272 --> 00:17:53,536
Research of
possession phenomenon,

153
00:17:53,876 --> 00:17:57,710
By religion, natural
science and psychology,

154
00:17:58,047 --> 00:18:01,141
continues extensively...

155
00:18:02,018 --> 00:18:04,851
There is an interesting case.

156
00:18:05,189 --> 00:18:10,058
It happened to a girl in France.

157
00:18:11,196 --> 00:18:12,720
She had smallpox...

158
00:18:13,432 --> 00:18:18,062
And was in a state of
suspended death...

159
00:18:18,938 --> 00:18:24,935
She recovered with another
person's personality.

160
00:18:25,613 --> 00:18:28,776
A woman who died
at about the same time,

161
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:34,119
Was believed to have
possessed the girl.

162
00:18:42,165 --> 00:18:44,133
It's green! Look! Look!

163
00:18:44,402 --> 00:18:48,566
The girl knew everything
about the dead woman.

164
00:18:50,609 --> 00:18:53,134
her condition lasted
for two years.

165
00:18:54,514 --> 00:18:57,176
Then, the girl's true
personality returned.

166
00:19:04,561 --> 00:19:05,550
I'm home.

167
00:19:29,486 --> 00:19:30,919
She must be Naoko

168
00:19:38,728 --> 00:19:39,490
Monami...

169
00:19:41,231 --> 00:19:42,129
It's me, Naoko.

170
00:19:43,066 --> 00:19:44,226
Hi, there.

171
00:19:46,302 --> 00:19:47,326
What in the...?

172
00:19:48,471 --> 00:19:49,938
Look like a teenager?

173
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:54,475
Maybe the skirt is too short?

174
00:19:54,677 --> 00:19:55,473
No...

175
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,475
Stop staring, Heisuke.

176
00:20:00,149 --> 00:20:01,377
Cut it out!

177
00:20:01,618 --> 00:20:03,142
I can't help it.

178
00:20:03,386 --> 00:20:04,648
Heisuke!

179
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:07,957
Stop it...

180
00:20:08,892 --> 00:20:09,551
See?

181
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:21,637
Heisuke.

182
00:20:23,406 --> 00:20:26,068
You know what I think?

183
00:20:27,844 --> 00:20:30,938
I should be Monami when
we're outside the house.

184
00:20:37,086 --> 00:20:38,053
It's an idea...

185
00:20:40,356 --> 00:20:42,051
We don't have a choice.

186
00:20:44,928 --> 00:20:48,955
Being your wife in
the house won't change.

187
00:20:51,301 --> 00:20:52,063
Right.

188
00:20:57,941 --> 00:21:01,377
I can't keep wearing this ring.

189
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:54,796
From now on this will be
my wedding ring

190
00:21:59,469 --> 00:22:02,802
I'll keep mine on.

191
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:08,440
That's nice of you.

192
00:22:12,915 --> 00:22:13,847
But...

193
00:22:17,754 --> 00:22:20,780
You're over 40, can you
be a high school girl?

194
00:22:28,598 --> 00:22:29,860
I can... I can!

195
00:22:32,869 --> 00:22:34,734
That's already out of date.

196
00:22:35,505 --> 00:22:38,303
You've got to get busy
with a lot of catching up.

197
00:22:40,176 --> 00:22:41,643
Now, go to sleep.

198
00:22:41,844 --> 00:22:43,675
We're a real weird couple.

199
00:22:43,846 --> 00:22:45,404
Ah, shut up.

200
00:23:01,164 --> 00:23:03,462
This sure brings
back memories.

201
00:23:04,901 --> 00:23:05,595
Monami!

202
00:23:09,972 --> 00:23:10,904
Why, hello.

203
00:23:11,174 --> 00:23:13,836
Are you all right now?

204
00:23:14,744 --> 00:23:15,904
Kuniko?

205
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:20,172
Gee, you grew up.

206
00:23:23,252 --> 00:23:25,743
Same class?

207
00:23:28,057 --> 00:23:29,547
What's with your skirt?

208
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:31,856
What?

209
00:23:32,028 --> 00:23:33,086
It's too long.

210
00:23:33,496 --> 00:23:36,556
Are you feeling better?
Just take it easy, okay?

211
00:23:37,233 --> 00:23:37,927
Smile.

212
00:23:39,268 --> 00:23:39,927
Yeah, thanks.

213
00:23:40,136 --> 00:23:40,864
Let's go.

214
00:23:41,104 --> 00:23:45,370
She's gone through this terrible
trauma...

215
00:23:46,309 --> 00:23:48,573
She forgets
faces and names.

216
00:23:49,145 --> 00:23:50,544
I see...

217
00:23:51,214 --> 00:23:55,241
She might find it very
hard to keep up in class.

218
00:23:56,652 --> 00:23:58,643
A new term is starting.

219
00:23:58,888 --> 00:24:00,879
She's a good student.
She'll be fine.

220
00:24:01,057 --> 00:24:04,026
No, I don't really think so.

221
00:24:06,929 --> 00:24:12,026
I'm sure she can't even
socialize with anyone.

222
00:24:18,274 --> 00:24:20,742
Don't worry about
her in school.

223
00:24:21,778 --> 00:24:22,540
Yes...

224
00:24:31,254 --> 00:24:32,812
Good morning.

225
00:24:39,295 --> 00:24:40,262
Monami!

226
00:24:43,399 --> 00:24:45,924
You're... 0dajima, right?

227
00:24:46,435 --> 00:24:47,493
Ah, yes.

228
00:24:48,638 --> 00:24:50,162
I'm glad you're with us.

229
00:24:50,506 --> 00:24:51,598
Me too.

230
00:24:52,708 --> 00:24:54,107
I sure am glad.

231
00:24:57,413 --> 00:24:58,573
Why'd you bother with him?

232
00:24:58,748 --> 00:25:01,308
He was a classmate before.

233
00:25:01,951 --> 00:25:03,942
So, you talked to him?

234
00:25:05,054 --> 00:25:08,319
Could you ignore him?

235
00:25:08,624 --> 00:25:10,057
I guess not.

236
00:25:10,226 --> 00:25:10,920
Monami!

237
00:25:11,494 --> 00:25:13,086
Long time no see.

238
00:25:21,504 --> 00:25:22,835
The second function...

239
00:25:23,105 --> 00:25:26,074
f (x) equals...

240
00:25:26,943 --> 00:25:29,707
a x squared plus...

241
00:25:29,879 --> 00:25:33,144
b x plus c...

242
00:25:33,883 --> 00:25:36,647
Find the value of the
constant a, b, c.

243
00:25:36,853 --> 00:25:38,013
I give up.

244
00:25:40,556 --> 00:25:42,456
Help me, Monami.

245
00:25:44,994 --> 00:25:47,224
Anyone have the answer?

246
00:25:54,904 --> 00:25:55,836
Miss Sugita.

247
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,206
You mean... me?

248
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:01,940
Yes.

249
00:26:10,353 --> 00:26:11,820
I'll wash your back.

250
00:26:13,356 --> 00:26:14,288
No thanks.

251
00:26:15,324 --> 00:26:16,291
Why?

252
00:26:16,459 --> 00:26:17,721
It's just...

253
00:26:18,461 --> 00:26:20,486
Come on, I always do.

254
00:26:23,199 --> 00:26:24,188
Yeah, right.

255
00:26:25,101 --> 00:26:28,161
You're Naoko, yeah.

256
00:26:31,073 --> 00:26:32,506
How's school?

257
00:26:33,242 --> 00:26:35,369
Exhausting.

258
00:26:35,544 --> 00:26:37,034
Kids are all around me.

259
00:26:37,246 --> 00:26:38,736
That's natural.

260
00:26:42,051 --> 00:26:43,382
Something's weird.

261
00:26:43,853 --> 00:26:44,547
What?

262
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,712
I thought math was
beyond me completely,

263
00:26:47,890 --> 00:26:50,290
But it's easy to come
up with answers.

264
00:26:52,962 --> 00:26:56,898
The conscious mind is yours,
but the brain is Monami's.

265
00:26:57,566 --> 00:27:00,228
The brain determines
talent and ability.

266
00:27:01,003 --> 00:27:04,996
You and Monami have the
same thought patterns.

267
00:27:07,043 --> 00:27:08,101
Maybe that's it.

268
00:27:16,252 --> 00:27:17,014
Finished.

269
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:18,880
Get in the tub.

270
00:27:19,088 --> 00:27:19,850
Thanks.

271
00:27:25,962 --> 00:27:27,293
Hey!

272
00:27:27,763 --> 00:27:29,060
Don't be shy.

273
00:27:31,033 --> 00:27:33,399
Cut it out.

274
00:27:34,971 --> 00:27:36,905
Regarding indemnity...

275
00:27:37,073 --> 00:27:40,565
Depending on the victim's
sex and age...

276
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:45,110
The sum will differ from
50 to 80 million yen.

277
00:27:45,748 --> 00:27:47,943
Can't you get at least
100 million?

278
00:27:48,117 --> 00:27:49,311
That's too cheap.

279
00:27:49,485 --> 00:27:51,112
Is life that cheap?

280
00:27:51,287 --> 00:27:53,619
Give my son back!

281
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:57,850
All of you have
a document...

282
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:02,856
That calculates the
formula for indemnity.

283
00:28:03,099 --> 00:28:05,260
You apply it
to figure out the amount.

284
00:28:05,468 --> 00:28:09,268
So, the amount can be
roughly decided.

285
00:28:09,805 --> 00:28:12,501
My two sons who just
started work were killed.

286
00:28:13,409 --> 00:28:16,173
They're not the same
as somebody's wife.

287
00:28:17,146 --> 00:28:18,272
200 million yen each!

288
00:28:25,921 --> 00:28:26,649
Well...

289
00:28:29,425 --> 00:28:31,450
Do you know the
cause of the accident?

290
00:28:34,530 --> 00:28:35,155
Yes.

291
00:28:35,831 --> 00:28:38,959
The bus company admits
it was the driver's fault.

292
00:28:39,168 --> 00:28:41,295
After a thorough inquiry?

293
00:28:41,704 --> 00:28:43,638
It won't bring back the dead!

294
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:51,302
Demand a thorough check
of the accident.

295
00:28:52,314 --> 00:28:55,010
It's what the people who
died want to know.

296
00:28:56,152 --> 00:28:57,119
Very well.

297
00:28:57,653 --> 00:29:00,315
The issue of overwork
of the driver...

298
00:29:00,689 --> 00:29:02,623
And other factors to be
double checked.

299
00:29:02,825 --> 00:29:04,690
Will be demanded from
the bus company.

300
00:29:05,661 --> 00:29:06,787
Please do that.

301
00:29:07,363 --> 00:29:08,295
I will.

302
00:29:15,638 --> 00:29:17,606
Money is the least concern.

303
00:29:19,041 --> 00:29:20,474
It's not the money...

304
00:29:21,811 --> 00:29:23,335
0ne more thing.

305
00:29:24,146 --> 00:29:28,242
The driver's son, Kajikawa,
is here.

306
00:29:29,885 --> 00:29:33,377
He wishes to make an
apology to everyone.

307
00:29:34,757 --> 00:29:35,746
Is it all right?

308
00:29:37,226 --> 00:29:39,353
Then, Kajikawa, please.

309
00:30:00,116 --> 00:30:01,208
Please accept...

310
00:30:03,986 --> 00:30:04,816
I'm sorry...

311
00:30:07,456 --> 00:30:10,084
That's no way to apologize.

312
00:30:14,096 --> 00:30:15,654
How many people are dead?

313
00:30:16,499 --> 00:30:17,761
Be more sincere.

314
00:30:20,669 --> 00:30:22,660
Who do you think you are?

315
00:30:23,539 --> 00:30:25,268
Your father did it!

316
00:30:36,385 --> 00:30:38,216
My dad's not a murderer!

317
00:30:40,456 --> 00:30:41,514
What's that?

318
00:30:45,294 --> 00:30:45,988
Come back here!

319
00:30:59,608 --> 00:31:00,836
Wait a minute.

320
00:31:02,111 --> 00:31:03,942
You were pretty rude.

321
00:31:06,549 --> 00:31:07,641
He's the one.

322
00:31:10,386 --> 00:31:11,978
He calls every night.

323
00:31:13,122 --> 00:31:15,022
Saying my dad's a murderer.

324
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,985
I recognize his voice.

325
00:31:23,365 --> 00:31:27,392
No compassion for the
victim's families?

326
00:31:28,404 --> 00:31:29,701
I feel sorry for them.

327
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:33,575
For you too.

328
00:31:35,878 --> 00:31:40,212
But my dad didn't cause
the accident on purpose.

329
00:31:46,188 --> 00:31:49,783
The bus company puts
all the blame on him.

330
00:31:52,595 --> 00:31:55,723
You have other family?

331
00:31:57,199 --> 00:31:58,723
No. That's why I came.

332
00:32:01,103 --> 00:32:02,229
Wait...

333
00:32:09,044 --> 00:32:10,705
He has an attitude.

334
00:32:13,048 --> 00:32:14,606
He's having a hard time.

335
00:32:16,218 --> 00:32:17,617
He's going to college?

336
00:32:18,454 --> 00:32:19,386
Who knows?

337
00:32:20,923 --> 00:32:24,051
If he worked overtime
for the tuition...

338
00:32:24,226 --> 00:32:26,057
The victims can't rest in peace.

339
00:32:27,963 --> 00:32:29,225
Who worked overtime?

340
00:32:30,032 --> 00:32:31,056
The driver.

341
00:32:32,434 --> 00:32:35,631
I heard him talking on the bus.

342
00:32:37,106 --> 00:32:38,698
Kajikawa, it's your turn.

343
00:32:40,743 --> 00:32:41,573
Yeah, sorry.

344
00:32:42,177 --> 00:32:43,269
Are you all right?

345
00:32:45,614 --> 00:32:47,741
I didn't sleep last night.

346
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:49,908
Driving a truck again?

347
00:32:50,419 --> 00:32:52,114
You're risking your job.

348
00:32:52,321 --> 00:32:55,620
But driving is the only
work I can do.

349
00:32:56,025 --> 00:32:58,357
Isn't moonlighting hard?

350
00:32:58,527 --> 00:32:59,858
Not too bad.

351
00:33:00,863 --> 00:33:05,527
It means happiness to my
family. That's what.

352
00:33:06,402 --> 00:33:08,802
Maybe he dozed off
at the wheel.

353
00:33:10,472 --> 00:33:12,804
I'll do the indemnity
negotiations.

354
00:33:14,109 --> 00:33:16,475
So, forget about the
accident.

355
00:33:28,324 --> 00:33:29,916
Monami!

356
00:33:30,993 --> 00:33:32,153
Pass it on!

357
00:33:32,328 --> 00:33:33,693
Pass! Pass the ball!

358
00:33:48,143 --> 00:33:49,007
Miss Sugita.

359
00:33:49,211 --> 00:33:50,143
Yes.

360
00:33:50,579 --> 00:33:51,841
Catch you later.

361
00:33:52,815 --> 00:33:54,146
How do you feel?

362
00:33:54,416 --> 00:33:55,508
I'm fine.

363
00:33:56,018 --> 00:33:57,315
Take care of yourself.

364
00:33:57,786 --> 00:33:58,480
Yes.

365
00:33:59,488 --> 00:34:02,946
That girl's worrying about
me makes me tired.

366
00:34:03,692 --> 00:34:07,128
Don't be ungrateful.
She's a fine teacher.

367
00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:10,093
You're taking her side.

368
00:34:10,366 --> 00:34:11,298
Silly.

369
00:34:13,369 --> 00:34:14,301
But you know...

370
00:34:15,337 --> 00:34:17,305
She's always watching me.

371
00:34:18,207 --> 00:34:21,734
It suffocates me.
Maybe she's suspicious.

372
00:34:22,378 --> 00:34:23,310
About what?

373
00:34:23,812 --> 00:34:25,404
That I'm not Monami.

374
00:34:25,914 --> 00:34:28,815
Silly. She's worried
about you, that's all.

375
00:34:36,225 --> 00:34:39,524
That sure is a pretty
heavy meal.

376
00:34:40,562 --> 00:34:44,396
I want to eat solid food,
'cause I'm young.

377
00:34:46,235 --> 00:34:47,429
Young. I see.

378
00:34:49,471 --> 00:34:50,938
Heisuke, what about it?

379
00:34:51,573 --> 00:34:52,403
What?

380
00:34:53,275 --> 00:34:54,071
Sex.

381
00:34:57,312 --> 00:34:59,974
Heisuke, shame on you.

382
00:35:00,382 --> 00:35:01,815
Why sex, out of the blue?

383
00:35:02,217 --> 00:35:04,879
Well, we talked about
my teacher, Miss Hashimoto.

384
00:35:05,087 --> 00:35:06,076
That's irrelevant.

385
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:09,687
Well, what'll you do?

386
00:35:12,027 --> 00:35:13,221
What'll I do?

387
00:35:15,898 --> 00:35:16,922
What can I do?

388
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:21,057
To my own daughter?

389
00:35:22,371 --> 00:35:24,339
You think I can make love?

390
00:35:26,942 --> 00:35:27,874
I guess not.

391
00:36:09,751 --> 00:36:10,547
Mr. Sugita?

392
00:36:11,487 --> 00:36:12,579
Yes?

393
00:36:13,622 --> 00:36:14,884
It's been a while.

394
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:16,216
Yes, it has...

395
00:36:19,394 --> 00:36:20,156
A medical school?

396
00:36:20,429 --> 00:36:21,293
Yes.

397
00:36:21,730 --> 00:36:26,224
It will be hard on her,
changing her subjects.

398
00:36:27,369 --> 00:36:28,597
Why in the world?

399
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,803
You have any inkling?

400
00:36:34,810 --> 00:36:35,504
No.

401
00:36:37,379 --> 00:36:38,607
Shall we sit down?

402
00:36:42,184 --> 00:36:44,152
Thank you.

403
00:37:08,110 --> 00:37:11,841
I didn't know we
were neighbors.

404
00:37:12,014 --> 00:37:14,881
I live further down
the road.

405
00:37:16,985 --> 00:37:17,815
Alone?

406
00:37:17,986 --> 00:37:19,044
Yes, that's right.

407
00:37:20,689 --> 00:37:21,678
Is that so...

408
00:37:31,633 --> 00:37:32,691
Well, now...

409
00:37:33,502 --> 00:37:35,834
What's she up to
with Heisuke?

410
00:37:36,438 --> 00:37:38,269
Well, I must be going.

411
00:37:39,241 --> 00:37:40,071
Thank you.

412
00:37:40,242 --> 00:37:42,176
Say hello to Monami.

413
00:37:42,344 --> 00:37:42,833
Yes.

414
00:37:43,011 --> 00:37:43,909
Good-bye.

415
00:37:53,956 --> 00:37:55,116
I caught you.

416
00:37:58,827 --> 00:38:01,318
You startled me.
Were you listening?

417
00:38:02,798 --> 00:38:04,561
Wipe off the grin.

418
00:38:05,233 --> 00:38:05,995
Who, me?

419
00:38:06,702 --> 00:38:10,035
She's your type all right.

420
00:38:10,505 --> 00:38:12,063
What's that mean?

421
00:38:12,407 --> 00:38:13,533
You're nuts!

422
00:38:15,377 --> 00:38:18,608
0uch! 0uch! .0uch!

423
00:38:25,387 --> 00:38:28,618
I want to study
cerebral medicine.

424
00:38:29,891 --> 00:38:33,327
I want to discover
what happened to me.

425
00:38:34,329 --> 00:38:35,387
I thought so.

426
00:38:37,432 --> 00:38:40,663
But can science cure it?

427
00:38:43,105 --> 00:38:45,869
Maybe not, but I want
to try.

428
00:38:46,775 --> 00:38:52,008
Just living and feeling
skeptical isn't easy.

429
00:38:53,382 --> 00:38:54,542
I guess not.

430
00:38:57,152 --> 00:38:58,449
0ne other thing...

431
00:39:00,122 --> 00:39:03,888
I don't want to waste
reliving a life.

432
00:39:05,961 --> 00:39:09,897
With Monami's body,
I want to do what I want.

433
00:39:11,767 --> 00:39:13,064
For Monami's sake too.

434
00:39:15,203 --> 00:39:18,263
I feel like I'm being
outstripped.

435
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:22,701
No good?

436
00:39:26,448 --> 00:39:27,676
I'll back you up.

437
00:39:28,984 --> 00:39:31,544
I can still work
for 20 more years.

438
00:39:42,164 --> 00:39:42,960
Hey!

439
00:39:43,665 --> 00:39:44,529
What?

440
00:39:45,701 --> 00:39:47,794
Is your skirt shorter?

441
00:39:48,170 --> 00:39:50,434
This is normal.

442
00:39:51,173 --> 00:39:55,075
Come on.
You're over forty.

443
00:39:55,911 --> 00:39:58,072
You hear? Naoko!

444
00:39:59,114 --> 00:40:00,206
Naoko?

445
00:40:02,184 --> 00:40:07,349
Famous foreign literature,

446
00:40:08,023 --> 00:40:12,016
Tolstoi, "War and Peace".

447
00:40:37,919 --> 00:40:38,647
Hey.

448
00:40:39,254 --> 00:40:40,084
Naoko!

449
00:40:40,489 --> 00:40:41,683
Look! Look!

450
00:40:42,491 --> 00:40:43,480
Hey!

451
00:40:44,926 --> 00:40:45,824
Naoko!

452
00:40:47,095 --> 00:40:48,187
Be quiet!

453
00:40:51,433 --> 00:40:52,422
I'm starving!

454
00:40:53,568 --> 00:40:56,435
Lots of pickles,

455
00:40:56,671 --> 00:40:58,468
Here! Here!

456
00:40:58,640 --> 00:40:59,629
Not me!

457
00:41:03,645 --> 00:41:05,510
So, the test is tomorrow.

458
00:41:08,083 --> 00:41:08,811
No problem.

459
00:41:09,818 --> 00:41:10,648
That's good.

460
00:41:11,653 --> 00:41:15,646
Here's something we put
all our energy in.

461
00:41:18,627 --> 00:41:19,321
Please.

462
00:41:19,494 --> 00:41:21,291
"C0NCENTRATl0N"

463
00:41:56,231 --> 00:41:58,859
If you don't pass,
there's always next year.

464
00:41:59,401 --> 00:42:00,959
And another year afterwards.

465
00:42:01,236 --> 00:42:04,171
If I didn't pass, then no one
passed.

466
00:42:04,739 --> 00:42:06,673
You're amazing.

467
00:42:12,347 --> 00:42:14,144
Look! There it is!

468
00:42:14,316 --> 00:42:15,340
Where? Where?

469
00:42:15,650 --> 00:42:16,810
0705

470
00:42:17,152 --> 00:42:18,244
7 0 5
Na-o-ko!

471
00:42:18,486 --> 00:42:20,181
0h, I see it.

472
00:42:21,022 --> 00:42:22,353
Thanks to my noodle power.

473
00:42:22,524 --> 00:42:24,082
Yes? Yes!

474
00:42:39,541 --> 00:42:41,133
0ne order of Sushi.

475
00:42:41,309 --> 00:42:41,968
Right!

476
00:42:43,245 --> 00:42:45,406
We haven't been here
for awhile.

477
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:46,644
Yeah.

478
00:42:46,982 --> 00:42:47,812
Here...

479
00:42:48,917 --> 00:42:51,977
It's my happiest time
to be with you like this.

480
00:42:53,388 --> 00:42:54,412
Yes, it is.

481
00:43:01,363 --> 00:43:02,489
Say, Heisuke.

482
00:43:04,566 --> 00:43:07,729
If you fancy that girl...

483
00:43:09,070 --> 00:43:09,900
Girl?

484
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:15,237
The teacher,
Taeko Hashimoto.

485
00:43:16,211 --> 00:43:17,803
That kid, Taeko?

486
00:43:18,546 --> 00:43:20,571
Now's the time
to make a move.

487
00:43:24,052 --> 00:43:27,044
I've got you, Naoko.

488
00:43:35,664 --> 00:43:36,653
Thank you.

489
00:43:46,041 --> 00:43:47,565
You missed some.

490
00:43:49,110 --> 00:43:50,168
Cut it out.

491
00:43:54,516 --> 00:43:56,108
Here. Herring.

492
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:00,983
You all right? Here...

493
00:45:28,843 --> 00:45:31,676
It might help
if I hide my face.

494
00:45:37,085 --> 00:45:38,848
And I'll be quiet.

495
00:45:43,691 --> 00:45:49,288
It just isn't right to do
it to Monami's body.

496
00:45:56,671 --> 00:45:58,605
I can use my mouth.

497
00:46:05,113 --> 00:46:08,776
Don't say that
with Monami's face.

498
00:46:20,195 --> 00:46:21,253
All right.

499
00:46:24,566 --> 00:46:25,362
Well...

500
00:46:27,268 --> 00:46:30,169
I'll sleep in Monami's
room from tomorrow.

501
00:46:42,851 --> 00:46:44,341
I guess you should.

502
00:46:46,688 --> 00:46:50,317
Maybe we should have
done that sooner.

503
00:47:03,171 --> 00:47:05,230
Can I sleep here
just for tonight?

504
00:47:09,477 --> 00:47:10,273
Yeah.

505
00:47:21,156 --> 00:47:24,956
For Monami's entering
medical college!

506
00:47:25,126 --> 00:47:26,525
Bottoms up!

507
00:47:26,761 --> 00:47:28,194
Congratulations!

508
00:47:29,497 --> 00:47:32,625
Daddy! Hurry up
and come here!

509
00:47:32,867 --> 00:47:33,663
Here.

510
00:47:39,641 --> 00:47:42,735
I promised Monami before.

511
00:47:43,478 --> 00:47:44,172
Right?

512
00:47:49,817 --> 00:47:53,082
You said you wanted to
eat grandpa's noodles.

513
00:47:54,689 --> 00:47:59,820
0h, yes, I was dying for it.
and I love this.

514
00:48:00,261 --> 00:48:01,023
Yes, yes!

515
00:48:10,471 --> 00:48:11,199
Delicious.

516
00:48:28,656 --> 00:48:29,680
I'm sorry.

517
00:48:32,927 --> 00:48:35,589
My mother really loved
grandpa's noodles.

518
00:48:56,884 --> 00:48:57,748
Tasty!

519
00:49:00,488 --> 00:49:02,319
Really good.

520
00:49:07,328 --> 00:49:09,853
Monami, do you have
a boyfriend?

521
00:49:10,365 --> 00:49:11,093
Why...

522
00:49:11,666 --> 00:49:12,564
No way!

523
00:49:12,767 --> 00:49:13,256
Why not?

524
00:49:13,468 --> 00:49:14,435
0ver my dead body.

525
00:49:14,936 --> 00:49:17,370
That's 'father-talk', Heisuke.

526
00:49:17,705 --> 00:49:20,640
She'll find a nice guy and get
married before you know it.

527
00:49:21,109 --> 00:49:23,737
The day you got married
to Naoko...

528
00:49:23,911 --> 00:49:26,607
0ur dad cried his eyes out.

529
00:49:27,115 --> 00:49:28,980
He said he wanted to hit
you, Heisuke.

530
00:49:29,250 --> 00:49:30,046
Nonsense.

531
00:49:30,218 --> 00:49:31,048
But you cried.

532
00:49:31,219 --> 00:49:32,481
That never happened.

533
00:49:32,654 --> 00:49:34,144
He really said that.

534
00:49:49,037 --> 00:49:50,868
Where's your dad?

535
00:49:51,706 --> 00:49:52,638
In the bath.

536
00:49:57,712 --> 00:50:00,545
That's nice.

537
00:50:05,286 --> 00:50:06,947
It feels stiff here.

538
00:50:08,656 --> 00:50:10,055
You can tell?

539
00:50:10,725 --> 00:50:13,660
Yeah, dad, you always feel
stiff right here...

540
00:50:13,828 --> 00:50:14,453
What?

541
00:50:15,797 --> 00:50:20,393
I mean, my dad gets
a stiff back too.

542
00:50:21,769 --> 00:50:23,100
He does?

543
00:50:24,539 --> 00:50:28,236
You rub his back too
like a good girl.

544
00:50:32,380 --> 00:50:33,278
Monami.

545
00:50:36,951 --> 00:50:37,747
Yes?

546
00:50:38,252 --> 00:50:40,880
You've grown up now.

547
00:50:41,689 --> 00:50:45,955
So, if your dad finds a
suitable lady...

548
00:50:46,394 --> 00:50:48,919
Let's give him our
blessing, all right?

549
00:50:59,073 --> 00:50:59,664
Yeah.

550
00:51:48,189 --> 00:51:51,989
Monami... I wonder
where she is now?

551
00:51:58,699 --> 00:52:00,758
Damn it all!

552
00:52:14,248 --> 00:52:15,579
Damn it!

553
00:52:35,236 --> 00:52:37,363
Thank you for waiting.
This way please.

554
00:52:42,643 --> 00:52:44,668
Here's the menu.
Please take you time.

555
00:52:46,814 --> 00:52:48,714
I'll be back in a moment.

556
00:52:56,290 --> 00:52:58,758
Welcome. How many in
the party?

557
00:53:01,662 --> 00:53:02,651
Ah, just a second.

558
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,467
What the...?

559
00:53:09,403 --> 00:53:10,131
What's wrong?

560
00:53:12,707 --> 00:53:14,766
Guess I lost my wallet.

561
00:53:16,043 --> 00:53:18,307
Come on, dad, you've
got to watch over me.

562
00:53:18,913 --> 00:53:19,811
I'll pay.

563
00:53:19,981 --> 00:53:20,845
All right?

564
00:53:21,682 --> 00:53:22,580
Thank you.

565
00:53:23,050 --> 00:53:23,846
All right?

566
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:27,084
Thanks.

567
00:53:29,991 --> 00:53:30,923
Heisuke...

568
00:53:34,495 --> 00:53:36,190
It can happen to anyone.

569
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:52,939
Hi.

570
00:53:55,783 --> 00:53:56,545
Hello.

571
00:53:57,418 --> 00:54:00,410
The money I owe you.

572
00:54:00,721 --> 00:54:04,020
You came all the way here
to pay me back? Come in.

573
00:54:04,325 --> 00:54:05,485
I've got to go.

574
00:54:06,928 --> 00:54:07,895
Thanks anyway

575
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:14,565
Thank you.

576
00:54:16,037 --> 00:54:19,939
Are you getting worker's
compensation?

577
00:54:21,475 --> 00:54:22,373
No.

578
00:54:22,977 --> 00:54:25,309
The company found out
dad was moonlighting.

579
00:54:26,814 --> 00:54:30,147
I see... And how about
your college?

580
00:54:32,386 --> 00:54:33,284
I quit.

581
00:54:37,058 --> 00:54:38,650
I got a job in
a noodle shop.

582
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:40,757
You did? Where?

583
00:54:41,162 --> 00:54:42,151
In Yotsuya.

584
00:54:42,463 --> 00:54:44,761
Yotsuya? That's near
my company.

585
00:54:45,733 --> 00:54:46,700
Do you know the "Kouya"?

586
00:54:47,468 --> 00:54:50,062
Yes, it's catty-corner from a
sushi shop.

587
00:54:50,371 --> 00:54:53,602
And the "Avalanche"
noodle shop nearby...

588
00:55:03,651 --> 00:55:07,052
You wanted to know the
cause of the accident.

589
00:55:10,725 --> 00:55:13,660
I think my dad dozed off
while driving.

590
00:55:15,129 --> 00:55:17,393
He was working recklessly.

591
00:55:20,334 --> 00:55:22,495
And it was all for you.

592
00:55:25,272 --> 00:55:26,102
Maybe.

593
00:55:27,108 --> 00:55:28,370
0ur life was never easy.

594
00:55:29,443 --> 00:55:31,377
Maybe he had a gambling debt.

595
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:34,474
He liked to gamble.

596
00:55:45,826 --> 00:55:50,957
What sick people need,
is not famous scholars.

597
00:55:52,166 --> 00:55:55,226
They need good clinicians.

598
00:55:55,903 --> 00:55:59,634
This is the basic doctrine
of our school.

599
00:56:00,541 --> 00:56:02,202
Never let it fade from
your mind...

600
00:56:03,044 --> 00:56:05,376
During the 6 years
you will study here.

601
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:10,715
For the many patients and
their families you'll meet,

602
00:56:11,686 --> 00:56:14,712
Do become good doctors.

603
00:56:34,842 --> 00:56:35,934
Join the sailboat club?

604
00:56:37,044 --> 00:56:39,740
I'll be busy studying.

605
00:56:40,081 --> 00:56:42,606
Anyone who only studies
won't make a good doctor.

606
00:56:43,884 --> 00:56:46,682
Physical stamina is vital
for doctors.

607
00:56:49,390 --> 00:56:51,449
Well... No thank you.

608
00:56:54,528 --> 00:56:55,426
Doctors need stamina!

609
00:56:56,530 --> 00:56:58,225
0ne two! 0ne two!

610
00:56:58,466 --> 00:57:00,195
Doctors need stamina!

611
00:57:00,434 --> 00:57:02,129
0ne two! 0ne two!

612
00:57:05,172 --> 00:57:07,003
I'm scared!

613
00:57:08,008 --> 00:57:10,909
Sugita! Pull!

614
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:13,778
Pull!

615
00:57:14,749 --> 00:57:15,773
Pull the jib!

616
00:57:17,084 --> 00:57:18,016
Stay cool!

617
00:57:19,687 --> 00:57:20,415
Stay put!

618
00:57:22,022 --> 00:57:23,080
Look forward!

619
00:57:24,959 --> 00:57:26,927
Let go of the jib!

620
00:57:27,261 --> 00:57:28,353
Loosen the sheet!

621
00:57:31,732 --> 00:57:32,892
Don't stand up!

622
00:57:33,100 --> 00:57:34,294
We'll capsize!

623
00:57:34,668 --> 00:57:35,430
Stay cool!

624
00:57:36,937 --> 00:57:38,234
I'm trying my best!

625
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:39,934
Sailboats?

626
00:57:40,441 --> 00:57:43,501
Stamina is vital
for doctors.

627
00:57:44,078 --> 00:57:44,840
Risky?

628
00:57:45,846 --> 00:57:47,677
They're all experts.

629
00:57:49,083 --> 00:57:50,948
And they are... men?

630
00:57:57,525 --> 00:58:00,426
A German farmer wanted to
hunt badgers.

631
00:58:00,861 --> 00:58:04,957
So, they crossed a dog with a
strong jaw and...

632
00:58:05,299 --> 00:58:09,531
A dog with short legs,
and that made dachshunds.
