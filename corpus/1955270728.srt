1
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:02,321
For Christ's sake.

2
00:02:19,405 --> 00:02:22,641
Get your vehicle under control
before you kill someone.

3
00:02:22,675 --> 00:02:26,646
Kelly, do you remember when
I allowed my townspeople

4
00:02:26,679 --> 00:02:28,381
to vote you into office?

5
00:02:28,413 --> 00:02:31,516
Kind of gave them a
feeling of solidarity.

6
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:32,785
You remember that?

7
00:02:32,818 --> 00:02:35,922
Well, you need to
remember one thing.

8
00:02:35,955 --> 00:02:39,425
You work for me, and
you're on probation,

9
00:02:39,457 --> 00:02:41,760
so I would tread lightly.

10
00:02:41,794 --> 00:02:44,864
Look, mayor, I'm just
doing what you hired

11
00:02:44,896 --> 00:02:47,699
me to do... enforce the law.

12
00:02:47,733 --> 00:02:49,301
My rules, Kelly.

13
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:50,536
My rules.

14
00:02:50,569 --> 00:02:53,173
Now, why don't you scurry back
and go protect my property.

15
00:03:00,778 --> 00:03:01,781
Yes, ma'am.

16
00:03:10,457 --> 00:03:16,053
<b>ON THE BRAIN</b>

17
00:03:16,956 --> 00:03:19,956
<b>Subrip: Pix</b>

18
00:04:11,082 --> 00:04:12,384
Cheers for mayor.

19
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:15,920
Only weeks until the town's wired
for internet and cell phones.

20
00:04:15,954 --> 00:04:17,857
Town's a-sproutin' back.

21
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:20,959
Hey mayor, how about
a round on the house?

22
00:04:20,992 --> 00:04:22,795
You bet.
Here you go.

23
00:04:22,827 --> 00:04:23,662
What are you doing?

24
00:04:23,696 --> 00:04:26,299
Come on.

25
00:04:26,331 --> 00:04:27,932
You know mayor,
I really love what

26
00:04:27,966 --> 00:04:29,869
you've done with this place.

27
00:04:29,901 --> 00:04:31,903
You know, I just give
the people what they want.

28
00:04:31,937 --> 00:04:35,641
A nice slow-cooked beef
that falls off the bone.

29
00:04:35,673 --> 00:04:38,343
When you concoct a good recipe,
you don't go changing it.

30
00:04:38,377 --> 00:04:40,513
You just keep it as it is.

31
00:04:40,545 --> 00:04:43,815
Hi Rev. Tell you, that
new whitewash on the church

32
00:04:43,848 --> 00:04:44,649
looks fantastic.

33
00:04:44,682 --> 00:04:46,552
Now all you have
left to do is put up

34
00:04:46,584 --> 00:04:49,888
the sign, Mayor's Church,
right above the door.

35
00:04:49,922 --> 00:04:51,090
Our honor, mayor.

36
00:04:51,122 --> 00:04:54,627
Say, you think you could rustle
up some chairs and desks?

37
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:55,695
Reverend, I'm a busy woman.

38
00:04:55,728 --> 00:04:58,597
It takes a lot to get this
town back on its feet.

39
00:04:58,629 --> 00:05:00,399
I'm going to delegate
that task to you.

40
00:05:00,432 --> 00:05:02,401
I think the more effort
you put into the church,

41
00:05:02,434 --> 00:05:04,070
the better you're going
to feel about yourself.

42
00:05:04,103 --> 00:05:06,504
You know, I'm contemplating
getting our youth involved

43
00:05:06,538 --> 00:05:07,872
in a book-selling carnival.

44
00:05:07,906 --> 00:05:10,009
Well, you know
what I always say.

45
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:11,843
Less thinking, more action.

46
00:05:11,877 --> 00:05:13,946
Go get 'em, Rev.

47
00:05:13,978 --> 00:05:14,879
Thank you, mayor.

48
00:05:15,314 --> 00:05:16,816
Jeez Murray!

49
00:05:16,848 --> 00:05:19,584
You need to watch that
greasy palm of yours.

50
00:05:19,617 --> 00:05:22,721
It might get you into
trouble one of these days.

51
00:05:22,754 --> 00:05:23,588
Thank you, Betty.

52
00:05:28,894 --> 00:05:29,762
I am swamped.

53
00:05:29,795 --> 00:05:31,831
Hey!

54
00:05:31,863 --> 00:05:36,435
So what's the 411 on that
foxy sheriff of yours?

55
00:05:36,468 --> 00:05:38,437
He's from Frisco, right?

56
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:40,373
And those massive boots.

57
00:05:40,406 --> 00:05:43,141
You know what they say about
a man and his boot size?

58
00:05:43,175 --> 00:05:46,645
Yeah, I don't
have to tell you.

59
00:05:46,677 --> 00:05:48,581
You're screwing him.

60
00:05:48,613 --> 00:05:49,781
Who else knows?

61
00:05:49,814 --> 00:05:50,615
Nobody cares.

62
00:05:50,649 --> 00:05:52,651
Too busy calculating
how to survive.

63
00:05:52,684 --> 00:05:53,652
How did you...

64
00:05:53,685 --> 00:05:55,054
It's in the way
you gaze at him.

65
00:05:55,086 --> 00:05:56,988
You could spot it a moon away.

66
00:05:57,021 --> 00:05:58,391
Yeah, I tossed him a pass.

67
00:05:58,423 --> 00:05:59,924
He didn't want
nothing to do with me.

68
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:01,994
I guess he digs the dark meat.

69
00:06:02,026 --> 00:06:02,961
Surprising?

70
00:06:02,995 --> 00:06:04,497
Well what did you expect?

71
00:06:04,529 --> 00:06:05,397
You bitch.

72
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:07,132
I am so jealous!

73
00:06:07,165 --> 00:06:09,868
I haven't had it in...
well masturbation

74
00:06:09,901 --> 00:06:12,170
doesn't count, right?

75
00:06:12,204 --> 00:06:15,875
All the good men have
skedaddled out of town...!

76
00:06:15,908 --> 00:06:18,144
Does he have any cute friends?

77
00:06:18,177 --> 00:06:19,745
Betty?

78
00:06:19,778 --> 00:06:21,381
Why don't you get back to work.

79
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:28,153
So, your boyfriend
hasn't quite learned

80
00:06:28,187 --> 00:06:31,924
the ways of Golden Torch yet.

81
00:06:31,956 --> 00:06:34,526
Why, did he give you
a parking ticket again?

82
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,896
Sweetheart, he's not going
to be around for a long time,

83
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:41,699
so I wouldn't too used to him.

84
00:06:41,733 --> 00:06:43,769
You can go ahead and pay
that when you're ready.

85
00:07:03,055 --> 00:07:04,889
Jeez Kelly.

86
00:07:04,923 --> 00:07:07,826
At least cover your
mouth, my God.

87
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,595
In some countries,
it's customary to let

88
00:07:09,627 --> 00:07:11,663
one go after a hearty meal.

89
00:07:11,697 --> 00:07:13,966
Well, we are in
America darling.

90
00:07:13,999 --> 00:07:14,967
It's rude.

91
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,002
OK.

92
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:21,674
You want to drink that?

93
00:07:21,706 --> 00:07:23,509
In a minute.

94
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:26,678
I love you, you know that?

95
00:07:26,711 --> 00:07:28,947
Yes.

96
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:32,617
I don't say it
often enough, but you

97
00:07:32,651 --> 00:07:34,920
are the best thing that's
happened to me in a long time.

98
00:07:39,257 --> 00:07:41,192
Me too, baby.

99
00:07:41,225 --> 00:07:44,096
A whole bunch.

100
00:07:44,129 --> 00:07:47,199
Man, I feel like
some ice cream.

101
00:07:47,232 --> 00:07:50,102
My God, OK.

102
00:07:50,134 --> 00:07:54,038
I'm dry, you polished off the
last two cartons last time.

103
00:07:54,072 --> 00:07:56,141
That's because
they're so small now.

104
00:07:56,173 --> 00:07:58,576
They went from two
liters to one and a half,

105
00:07:58,610 --> 00:07:59,944
in the same container.

106
00:07:59,978 --> 00:08:01,547
Nobody seemed to notice.

107
00:08:01,579 --> 00:08:02,247
Well you did.

108
00:08:02,281 --> 00:08:04,650
Of course I did.

109
00:08:04,682 --> 00:08:05,884
I'm a cop.

110
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:07,653
Sometimes the
smallest of details

111
00:08:07,685 --> 00:08:09,221
can solve the biggest of cases.

112
00:08:09,254 --> 00:08:10,256
OK.

113
00:08:15,026 --> 00:08:17,529
Damn baby, you didn't take
that medicine I prescribed you,

114
00:08:17,562 --> 00:08:18,897
did you?

115
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:21,032
Just getting used to
the new environment.

116
00:08:21,065 --> 00:08:23,902
I'll be OK.

117
00:08:23,935 --> 00:08:26,805
Romance and cop work don't
mix too well together.

118
00:08:30,608 --> 00:08:31,810
What now?

119
00:08:31,843 --> 00:08:34,612
You know, you're the only woman
I would blaze the wilderness

120
00:08:34,645 --> 00:08:38,616
for to round up some junk food.

121
00:08:38,649 --> 00:08:39,918
You and me forever, right?

122
00:08:43,322 --> 00:08:44,956
I'm going to go get
some more coffee.

123
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:45,823
All right.

124
00:08:45,856 --> 00:08:46,891
You want to come with me?

125
00:08:46,924 --> 00:08:49,060
I'm going to run to Eddie's.

126
00:08:49,094 --> 00:08:50,930
Get some ice cream.

127
00:08:50,962 --> 00:08:52,564
At this hour?

128
00:09:09,081 --> 00:09:09,815
Howdy, sheriff.

129
00:09:13,818 --> 00:09:14,719
Hey.

130
00:09:14,754 --> 00:09:16,087
Smoking will stunt
your growth, young lady.

131
00:09:18,823 --> 00:09:21,192
These look stunted
to you, sheriff?

132
00:09:21,225 --> 00:09:22,827
Run home, before
I call your father.

133
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:30,201
Hey sheriff.

134
00:09:30,235 --> 00:09:32,671
McCreedy's mangy mutt
attacked me again.

135
00:09:32,703 --> 00:09:34,072
Luckily I nabbed
him, or the bitch

136
00:09:34,105 --> 00:09:36,609
would have bit my ball sack off.

137
00:09:36,642 --> 00:09:40,212
I got a good dose of mace right
in the mutt's kisser, though.

138
00:09:40,245 --> 00:09:42,681
Hey Eddie, you got
any Ben and Jerry's?

139
00:09:42,714 --> 00:09:44,183
Just what you see, sheriff.

140
00:09:44,216 --> 00:09:45,585
Ain't the big city, you know.

141
00:09:58,163 --> 00:10:01,000
One night with me, sheriff,
will clear that cough right up.

142
00:10:07,873 --> 00:10:09,141
Sheriff?

143
00:10:09,173 --> 00:10:10,408
Sheriff!

144
00:10:10,442 --> 00:10:12,845
There's something
wrong with Murray!

145
00:10:12,878 --> 00:10:13,846
My head, my...

146
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:15,880
Sheriff!

147
00:10:20,418 --> 00:10:21,853
Are you OK, Murray?

148
00:10:21,886 --> 00:10:23,888
You don't look so good, man.

149
00:10:23,922 --> 00:10:24,590
What is it?

150
00:10:24,623 --> 00:10:27,059
You want me to call a doctor?

151
00:10:27,091 --> 00:10:29,794
Murray, you all right?

152
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:35,100
What the hell?

153
00:10:35,133 --> 00:10:37,036
Get off of her!

154
00:10:37,068 --> 00:10:38,036
Get off of...

155
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:39,038
Damn it, Murray.

156
00:10:44,308 --> 00:10:45,977
Damn it Murray,
you stay right here.

157
00:10:48,714 --> 00:10:49,782
It's OK.
It's OK.

158
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:51,183
It's over now.

159
00:10:57,154 --> 00:10:58,723
Look!

160
00:10:58,756 --> 00:10:59,724
Behind you!

161
00:11:03,061 --> 00:11:04,062
Murray, stop!

162
00:11:07,432 --> 00:11:09,368
Murray, God damn it!

163
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,402
No!

164
00:12:16,067 --> 00:12:17,469
My God, Kelly.

165
00:12:17,501 --> 00:12:18,469
God.

166
00:12:18,503 --> 00:12:20,072
Are you OK?

167
00:12:20,105 --> 00:12:20,471
Yeah.

168
00:12:20,504 --> 00:12:21,506
Sit down.

169
00:12:25,509 --> 00:12:27,045
Are Eddie and
Murray really dead?

170
00:12:31,383 --> 00:12:31,950
Yeah.

171
00:12:31,982 --> 00:12:32,449
Yeah.

172
00:12:32,484 --> 00:12:36,288
It's OK, it's OK.

173
00:12:36,321 --> 00:12:37,855
It's OK.

174
00:12:37,889 --> 00:12:38,890
They're both dead.

175
00:12:52,537 --> 00:12:57,442
Murray... I don't know.

176
00:12:57,475 --> 00:13:00,512
They both started
attacking Courtney.

177
00:13:00,544 --> 00:13:01,379
No provocation.

178
00:13:04,081 --> 00:13:08,287
God, the look on their
faces, the distortion.

179
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,556
I've never seen
anything like it.

180
00:13:14,893 --> 00:13:16,894
How's Courtney doing?

181
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:18,263
She's shaken up.

182
00:13:18,296 --> 00:13:20,465
Her father rushed
her out of town.

183
00:13:20,498 --> 00:13:22,434
Did he take her to a hospital?

184
00:13:22,466 --> 00:13:25,002
I don't know.

185
00:13:25,035 --> 00:13:27,371
I don't know.

186
00:13:27,404 --> 00:13:28,372
It's OK.

187
00:13:28,405 --> 00:13:29,373
It's OK.

188
00:13:29,407 --> 00:13:30,376
Let me see.

189
00:13:35,346 --> 00:13:37,481
You killed Eddie?

190
00:13:37,514 --> 00:13:38,350
And the mailman?

191
00:13:41,285 --> 00:13:43,421
Do you have any
clue how hard it is

192
00:13:43,455 --> 00:13:46,057
for me to find somebody
who's dedicated enough

193
00:13:46,091 --> 00:13:50,461
to go out six days a week, rain
or shine, and deliver the mail?

194
00:13:50,495 --> 00:13:51,328
Any idea?

195
00:13:51,363 --> 00:13:53,098
Mayor, wait till
you get all the facts

196
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:54,466
before you start saying stuff.

197
00:13:54,499 --> 00:13:57,269
Please, shut up.

198
00:13:57,302 --> 00:13:58,870
Nobody is talking to you.

199
00:13:58,903 --> 00:13:59,638
Mayor!

200
00:13:59,671 --> 00:14:01,173
Don't speak to her that way.

201
00:14:01,206 --> 00:14:03,475
She wasn't even there.

202
00:14:03,508 --> 00:14:06,478
And I didn't kill Eddie.

203
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:07,945
He killed himself.

204
00:14:07,979 --> 00:14:13,151
He... he...
give me your gun.

205
00:14:13,183 --> 00:14:14,452
Are you firing me?

206
00:14:14,485 --> 00:14:15,953
Your goddamn piece.

207
00:14:15,986 --> 00:14:17,322
Now.

208
00:14:17,355 --> 00:14:18,356
Unbelievable.

209
00:14:28,432 --> 00:14:30,269
Go ahead and give
me the bullets, too.

210
00:14:30,302 --> 00:14:32,504
Just take it.

211
00:14:32,537 --> 00:14:35,240
Until I figure out what
the hell happened out there,

212
00:14:35,273 --> 00:14:38,576
you're a cop without a weapon.

213
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:42,346
Now I want a detailed
report on my desk yesterday.

214
00:14:42,379 --> 00:14:44,482
If it matches
what's on the tape,

215
00:14:44,515 --> 00:14:46,183
then you can have your gun back.

216
00:14:46,216 --> 00:14:48,386
Don't point that at me.

217
00:14:48,419 --> 00:14:50,054
I'm sorry.

218
00:14:50,087 --> 00:14:50,988
Is this better?

219
00:14:51,022 --> 00:14:52,024
Fuck you, mayor.

220
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:52,658
I can't.

221
00:14:52,691 --> 00:14:53,425
I'm busy.

222
00:14:59,397 --> 00:15:00,666
I'll take the key to this, too.

223
00:15:10,442 --> 00:15:12,610
Someone's here.

224
00:15:12,644 --> 00:15:15,580
You think?

225
00:15:15,613 --> 00:15:17,549
Sheriff, I need your help.

226
00:15:17,581 --> 00:15:18,649
Jesus.

227
00:15:18,682 --> 00:15:19,585
Now what?

228
00:15:34,599 --> 00:15:37,136
Ms. McCreedy, is
everything all right?

229
00:15:40,538 --> 00:15:42,140
I don't know what to do.

230
00:15:46,076 --> 00:15:48,080
I didn't want to come here.

231
00:15:52,384 --> 00:15:54,452
Is Gus here?

232
00:15:54,485 --> 00:15:56,053
Where's Gus?

233
00:15:56,086 --> 00:15:57,621
He's not here.

234
00:15:57,654 --> 00:16:00,091
What is it?
What's wrong?

235
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:01,326
He's...

236
00:16:01,359 --> 00:16:03,528
Is it Zeke?

237
00:16:03,561 --> 00:16:04,162
Yeah.

238
00:16:04,195 --> 00:16:05,129
Did he hit you?

239
00:16:05,163 --> 00:16:07,666
No.

240
00:16:07,698 --> 00:16:09,200
I fell.

241
00:16:09,234 --> 00:16:11,168
He never hurt me.

242
00:16:11,201 --> 00:16:13,071
Zeke loved me.

243
00:16:13,104 --> 00:16:14,605
He loves me.

244
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:17,209
Zeke.

245
00:16:17,241 --> 00:16:20,611
He couldn't move.

246
00:16:20,644 --> 00:16:24,149
He couldn't speak.

247
00:16:24,182 --> 00:16:28,287
His last words were,
"Something's in my head".

248
00:16:31,623 --> 00:16:33,057
Something's in my head.

249
00:16:37,796 --> 00:16:41,299
Why are you covered in blood?

250
00:16:41,331 --> 00:16:42,333
No!

251
00:16:45,302 --> 00:16:48,240
Where's Gus?

252
00:16:48,273 --> 00:16:49,641
Where's Gus?

253
00:16:49,673 --> 00:16:50,675
Gus!

254
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:57,182
Damn, that was weird.

255
00:16:57,215 --> 00:16:59,518
Yeah.

256
00:16:59,551 --> 00:17:01,520
I'm going to go check on her.

257
00:17:01,552 --> 00:17:02,553
OK.

258
00:17:34,285 --> 00:17:35,253
Start!

259
00:17:35,286 --> 00:17:38,256
Start, God damn it, start!

260
00:17:38,288 --> 00:17:38,956
Zeke!

261
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:41,192
Why are you doing this, Zeke?

262
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:42,594
Get it out of your head!

263
00:17:42,626 --> 00:17:44,195
Get it out!

264
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:46,198
Zeke, you don't want to hurt me.

265
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:48,567
Zeke!

266
00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:50,568
Somebody help me!

267
00:17:50,602 --> 00:17:53,171
You don't want to
hurt me, please!

268
00:17:53,203 --> 00:17:55,573
Zeke, stop it!

269
00:17:55,606 --> 00:17:56,575
Stop it!

270
00:17:56,607 --> 00:17:59,144
Start, start!

271
00:17:59,176 --> 00:18:01,545
Please start, please!

272
00:18:01,578 --> 00:18:03,882
Please, stop it!

273
00:18:04,915 --> 00:18:05,884
Zeke, look.

274
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:07,485
Look at the ring.

275
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:09,855
Zeke, Zeke, you love me.

276
00:18:09,887 --> 00:18:11,856
Zeke, no!

277
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:14,459
Zeke, stop it, stop it!

278
00:18:14,491 --> 00:18:17,461
Zeke, get it out of your head!

279
00:18:17,494 --> 00:18:19,430
Zeke, stop!

280
00:18:19,463 --> 00:18:20,465
Zeke!

281
00:18:22,866 --> 00:18:24,435
Zeke, stop!

282
00:18:24,469 --> 00:18:25,403
Stop it!

283
00:18:25,435 --> 00:18:27,404
Zeke, I don't want to hurt you.

284
00:18:27,438 --> 00:18:27,806
Zeke!

285
00:18:27,838 --> 00:18:29,807
No!

286
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,775
No!

287
00:18:31,808 --> 00:18:32,777
Zeke!

288
00:18:32,809 --> 00:18:36,347
Stop, Zeke!

289
00:18:36,381 --> 00:18:37,749
Stop!

290
00:18:37,781 --> 00:18:38,750
Help me!

291
00:18:38,782 --> 00:18:39,784
Help me!

292
00:19:14,652 --> 00:19:15,653
Zeke.

293
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:23,461
Zeke?

294
00:19:27,765 --> 00:19:30,735
Zeke, what happened to you?

295
00:19:30,768 --> 00:19:32,371
Are you OK, Zeke?

296
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:38,810
Where's Louise, Zeke?

297
00:19:38,843 --> 00:19:41,246
I killed her.

298
00:19:41,278 --> 00:19:42,747
You did what, Zeke?

299
00:19:42,779 --> 00:19:44,782
She's dead.

300
00:19:44,816 --> 00:19:47,986
Put your hands in the
air right now, Zeke.

301
00:19:48,019 --> 00:19:48,953
You hear me?

302
00:19:48,987 --> 00:19:50,388
My head.

303
00:19:50,421 --> 00:19:52,757
I'm warning you,
right now Zeke.

304
00:19:52,789 --> 00:19:57,394
There's something in my head.

305
00:19:57,428 --> 00:19:58,797
Kill me.

306
00:20:17,914 --> 00:20:21,019
I cant believe there's
nothing on Murray or Eddie.

307
00:20:21,051 --> 00:20:22,353
Just me being investigated.

308
00:20:26,657 --> 00:20:28,759
What the hell is
wrong with this town?

309
00:20:59,824 --> 00:21:00,792
Sheriff?

310
00:21:00,825 --> 00:21:01,459
Sheriff?

311
00:21:01,492 --> 00:21:03,662
God, Christ, pick up!

312
00:21:03,694 --> 00:21:05,029
Hurry!

313
00:21:05,063 --> 00:21:06,031
What is it, Gus?

314
00:21:06,064 --> 00:21:07,199
What's wrong?

315
00:21:07,231 --> 00:21:09,800
Get over
to bloody McCreedy's, fast.

316
00:21:09,834 --> 00:21:10,802
They're dead.

317
00:21:10,835 --> 00:21:12,636
They're all dead.

318
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:14,372
What?

319
00:21:14,404 --> 00:21:16,740
Dead?

320
00:21:16,773 --> 00:21:17,741
How?

321
00:21:17,775 --> 00:21:19,344
I don't know.

322
00:21:19,376 --> 00:21:21,346
Just hurry.

323
00:21:21,378 --> 00:21:23,347
Gus, secure the scene.

324
00:21:23,381 --> 00:21:24,916
Don't touch anything.

325
00:21:24,949 --> 00:21:25,951
I'm on my way.

326
00:21:50,907 --> 00:21:52,443
Gus.

327
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:53,845
What the hell happened?

328
00:21:59,116 --> 00:22:00,684
I'm not going up there.

329
00:22:00,718 --> 00:22:02,053
You can't make me.

330
00:22:02,086 --> 00:22:03,621
Why, what's up there?

331
00:22:03,653 --> 00:22:04,622
It's Louise.

332
00:22:04,654 --> 00:22:06,958
She's dead.

333
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:09,327
Stay here.
I'll be right back.

334
00:22:34,719 --> 00:22:37,622
Gus.

335
00:22:37,654 --> 00:22:40,090
I'm sorry about your friends.

336
00:22:40,124 --> 00:22:43,461
Why did do it, sheriff?

337
00:22:43,493 --> 00:22:48,500
He drank too much, but he didn't
have a mean bone in his body.

338
00:22:48,532 --> 00:22:50,801
Him and Louise was
high-school sweethearts.

339
00:22:54,204 --> 00:22:56,073
What happened?

340
00:22:56,106 --> 00:22:57,041
Exactly, Gus.

341
00:23:01,179 --> 00:23:05,150
You know, I don't get it.

342
00:23:05,182 --> 00:23:08,452
Before you barreled
into this town,

343
00:23:08,486 --> 00:23:11,623
things was peaceful around here.

344
00:23:11,655 --> 00:23:13,524
I don't get it.

345
00:23:13,557 --> 00:23:16,961
You brought a curse around
this town or something.

346
00:23:16,993 --> 00:23:20,063
Kelly,
Kelly, please pick up.

347
00:23:20,096 --> 00:23:22,000
Pick up.

348
00:23:22,032 --> 00:23:23,967
What is it?
What's wrong?

349
00:23:24,999 --> 00:23:27,004
She's dead.

350
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:28,906
Lock yourself in the car.

351
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:30,508
I'm on my way.

352
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:31,708
Stay here.

353
00:23:31,741 --> 00:23:32,911
Don't make me.

354
00:23:32,943 --> 00:23:34,979
Guard the God
damned bodies, Gus.

355
00:23:35,011 --> 00:23:36,513
You're a cop.

356
00:23:36,547 --> 00:23:38,516
Do your job.

357
00:23:38,548 --> 00:23:39,951
God damned sheriff.

358
00:24:07,644 --> 00:24:09,980
Mary Alma, you're
OK, aren't you?

359
00:24:10,013 --> 00:24:10,948
No.

360
00:24:10,981 --> 00:24:14,885
It's OK.
I'm here.

361
00:24:28,865 --> 00:24:30,999
You don't have to do this.

362
00:24:32,803 --> 00:24:34,105
I gotta do this for Betty.

363
00:24:47,018 --> 00:24:48,586
Shorts ripped off.

364
00:24:48,618 --> 00:24:50,020
Possible rape.

365
00:24:53,624 --> 00:24:55,026
Potential murder weapon.

366
00:25:19,317 --> 00:25:20,751
Who the hell is there?

367
00:25:20,785 --> 00:25:24,689
Betty, it's
Reverend Peter Lamper.

368
00:25:24,721 --> 00:25:25,690
Hold your water, dude.

369
00:25:25,722 --> 00:25:27,692
I will attend to
you in a second.

370
00:25:33,029 --> 00:25:34,898
Enter if you dare, darling.

371
00:25:34,932 --> 00:25:38,169
I pray
I'm not intruding.

372
00:25:38,201 --> 00:25:39,971
You want a beer or something?

373
00:25:40,003 --> 00:25:42,105
You know what
the good book says.

374
00:25:42,138 --> 00:25:43,173
Whatever

375
00:25:43,207 --> 00:25:45,109
We missed you in
church this morning.

376
00:25:45,142 --> 00:25:46,611
Really?

377
00:25:46,644 --> 00:25:48,246
Is it Sunday already?

378
00:25:48,278 --> 00:25:51,648
I came to share a passage
from today's sermon, Betty.

379
00:25:51,682 --> 00:25:54,818
The Word of God does wonders.

380
00:25:54,852 --> 00:25:59,757
Our father, who art in
heaven, hallowed be Thy name.

381
00:26:06,163 --> 00:26:07,164
Peter?

382
00:26:11,134 --> 00:26:12,136
What's going on?

383
00:26:16,106 --> 00:26:18,675
You're scare... Peter?

384
00:26:18,709 --> 00:26:20,077
You're scaring me, Peter.

385
00:26:21,711 --> 00:26:23,981
Peter?
My God!

386
00:26:57,314 --> 00:27:00,250
At least she was able
to make it to the phone.

387
00:27:00,284 --> 00:27:05,790
Kelly, I took that call.

388
00:27:07,791 --> 00:27:10,093
I'm sorry.

389
00:27:10,126 --> 00:27:11,428
Did you hear any voices?

390
00:27:11,461 --> 00:27:13,865
Anything in the background?

391
00:27:13,897 --> 00:27:15,899
No, it was dead silence.

392
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:25,243
What is that by the door?

393
00:27:25,276 --> 00:27:26,978
Crap.

394
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:29,346
It's Peter's bible.

395
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:30,982
I gotta get outta here.

396
00:27:37,788 --> 00:27:39,124
Why is this happening?

397
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:43,894
I don't know.

398
00:27:43,928 --> 00:27:44,929
Why Betty?

399
00:27:48,332 --> 00:27:53,871
She never hurt anybody
in her whole life.

400
00:27:53,903 --> 00:27:55,306
Why is this happening?

401
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:03,814
What was that?

402
00:28:03,847 --> 00:28:06,216
Stay behind me.

403
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:07,251
Tight.

404
00:28:22,232 --> 00:28:24,801
My God.

405
00:28:24,835 --> 00:28:26,471
What the hell is he doing?

406
00:28:29,807 --> 00:28:31,409
and forgive
us our trespasses...

407
00:28:31,442 --> 00:28:31,942
Peter!

408
00:28:31,976 --> 00:28:33,945
On the ground, now.

409
00:28:33,978 --> 00:28:35,779
and lead us not
into temptation,

410
00:28:35,813 --> 00:28:39,083
but deliver us from evil.

411
00:28:39,115 --> 00:28:42,185
No Mary Alma, stay back.

412
00:28:47,191 --> 00:28:48,192
No!

413
00:28:57,801 --> 00:28:59,102
It's OK.

414
00:28:59,135 --> 00:29:01,838
It's OK.

415
00:29:01,872 --> 00:29:03,975
My God, Peter.

416
00:29:04,008 --> 00:29:05,009
No.

417
00:29:17,253 --> 00:29:19,423
Here you go.

418
00:29:19,455 --> 00:29:21,225
Sit anywhere you like, honey.

419
00:29:25,829 --> 00:29:26,963
That's a good spot.

420
00:29:26,997 --> 00:29:29,066
Welcome to the Mayor's Grill.

421
00:29:29,098 --> 00:29:30,268
We're here to fill you up.

422
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:31,802
What can I get you?

423
00:29:31,836 --> 00:29:33,237
What's good here?

424
00:29:33,269 --> 00:29:35,539
Everything's fantastic,
but I tell you what.

425
00:29:35,573 --> 00:29:38,276
I'd recommend the
prime rib, rare.

426
00:29:38,308 --> 00:29:40,010
Sounds appetizing.

427
00:29:40,044 --> 00:29:43,347
Hey are you, working on
that new expansion down on 36?

428
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:44,148
Yes ma'am.

429
00:29:44,181 --> 00:29:46,150
It should put your
town on the map.

430
00:29:46,182 --> 00:29:47,218
Fantastic.

431
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:49,287
I'll tell you, that's what
I've been praying for.

432
00:29:49,319 --> 00:29:50,855
Well, make sure you
tell all your coworkers

433
00:29:50,887 --> 00:29:52,455
and your friends
about Mayor's Grill.

434
00:29:52,489 --> 00:29:54,192
Best eats in 40 miles.

435
00:29:54,224 --> 00:29:55,158
My lucky day, then.

436
00:29:55,192 --> 00:29:56,394
All right.

437
00:29:56,426 --> 00:29:59,230
Anyway, I'll take
whatever you got on tap.

438
00:29:59,262 --> 00:30:00,264
You got it.

439
00:30:25,388 --> 00:30:26,923
What are you doing
here so early?

440
00:30:26,957 --> 00:30:27,959
Where have you been?

441
00:30:30,627 --> 00:30:33,563
I am so sick of that
damn cold of yours.

442
00:30:33,596 --> 00:30:34,565
Please drink that.

443
00:30:34,597 --> 00:30:38,201
Since you're not taking
your meds it might help.

444
00:30:40,104 --> 00:30:42,173
It's good.

445
00:30:42,205 --> 00:30:45,442
Mayor cleaned
out all the guns.

446
00:30:45,476 --> 00:30:47,345
What, and you didn't
try and stop her?

447
00:30:47,377 --> 00:30:50,280
She scares me sometimes.

448
00:30:50,314 --> 00:30:53,918
Now without a gun, without
any way to protect us.

449
00:30:53,951 --> 00:30:57,087
Damn it Kelly, I'm doing
the best I can here.

450
00:30:57,121 --> 00:30:58,890
No cell phone, no internet.

451
00:30:58,923 --> 00:31:01,459
Jesus, I can't believe
this damn town sometimes.

452
00:31:01,491 --> 00:31:03,461
There's Peter's medical file.

453
00:31:03,493 --> 00:31:05,929
This is justice done by
suicide, but what's the motive?

454
00:31:05,962 --> 00:31:06,630
I don't get it.

455
00:31:06,663 --> 00:31:08,365
One step at a time Mary Alma.

456
00:31:08,398 --> 00:31:09,566
I'm doing the best I can.

457
00:31:09,599 --> 00:31:11,501
I'm swimming in a pool
of dead bodies here.

458
00:31:11,535 --> 00:31:13,403
The least you can do is
throw me a life vest.

459
00:31:13,436 --> 00:31:15,071
Jesus.

460
00:31:15,105 --> 00:31:16,173
Kelly, I'm overwhelmed too.

461
00:31:16,205 --> 00:31:18,341
I've never been around some
much senseless killing.

462
00:31:18,375 --> 00:31:20,243
Everyone we know
is dead, or will

463
00:31:20,277 --> 00:31:21,645
be if we don't do
something about it.

464
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:22,513
It's not my fault.

465
00:31:22,546 --> 00:31:24,082
I never said it was.

466
00:31:31,355 --> 00:31:32,589
Say ma'am?

467
00:31:32,623 --> 00:31:36,227
It's,
it's actually mayor.

468
00:31:36,259 --> 00:31:38,229
I own this beautiful 'burb.

469
00:31:38,261 --> 00:31:42,599
It's been in my
family since 1889.

470
00:31:42,633 --> 00:31:45,135
Excuse me, mayor.

471
00:31:45,169 --> 00:31:47,271
Is that lady OK over there?

472
00:31:47,304 --> 00:31:50,141
That's Nancy.

473
00:31:50,173 --> 00:31:51,509
She's a little
touched in the head,

474
00:31:51,541 --> 00:31:54,110
but all small towns
have one of those.

475
00:31:54,144 --> 00:31:55,145
Come on, eat up.

476
00:31:59,115 --> 00:32:01,285
Nothing makes any sense.

477
00:32:01,317 --> 00:32:03,086
Peter had a physical
three months ago.

478
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:06,289
An EKG, blood work, urine
test... they were all normal.

479
00:32:06,323 --> 00:32:08,659
He didn't smoke or drink, and
he wasn't on any prescription

480
00:32:08,692 --> 00:32:11,061
medicine either.

481
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:15,031
By all accounts, Peter, he...
he was a normal healthy guy.

482
00:32:15,065 --> 00:32:16,634
Betty never said
anything to you, right?

483
00:32:16,666 --> 00:32:19,602
No nothing about Peter.

484
00:32:24,674 --> 00:32:28,346
Betty's tox screen shows a
blood alcohol content of.12.

485
00:32:28,378 --> 00:32:29,579
Betty's murdered.

486
00:32:29,613 --> 00:32:31,382
Peter's identified
by fingerprints,

487
00:32:31,414 --> 00:32:35,086
physical evidence,
and blood transfers.

488
00:32:35,118 --> 00:32:37,387
This is justice done by
suicide, but what's the motive?

489
00:32:37,421 --> 00:32:39,557
I don't get it.

490
00:32:39,589 --> 00:32:40,624
It's just that...

491
00:32:42,092 --> 00:32:43,060
It might be the mayor.

492
00:32:43,093 --> 00:32:44,729
I'll get it.

493
00:32:44,761 --> 00:32:46,730
Mary Alma?

494
00:32:46,763 --> 00:32:48,031
Get over here, now.

495
00:33:01,644 --> 00:33:03,146
What the hell happened, Mayor?

496
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:06,116
God damn it Mary Alma,
what is he doing here?

497
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:08,085
City folk is what happened here.

498
00:33:08,117 --> 00:33:10,086
He went after Nancy
for no reason,

499
00:33:10,119 --> 00:33:11,488
and I had to show
him how we take

500
00:33:11,521 --> 00:33:13,057
care of people around here.

501
00:33:15,058 --> 00:33:17,260
Get off her, you sick bastard.

502
00:33:26,236 --> 00:33:27,204
Get away from her.

503
00:33:27,237 --> 00:33:28,773
Nancy, come on.

504
00:33:28,806 --> 00:33:30,141
Wait a second.

505
00:33:30,173 --> 00:33:31,608
This is a crime scene.

506
00:33:31,642 --> 00:33:33,477
We need to interview
both of you.

507
00:33:33,509 --> 00:33:35,378
Get away!
They'll kill us all!

508
00:33:35,412 --> 00:33:37,748
Jesus Christ mayor, what
the hell are you doing?

509
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:39,750
Don't fuck with
me today, Kelly.

510
00:33:39,782 --> 00:33:41,451
I have no problem
putting you down

511
00:33:41,484 --> 00:33:42,719
like I put that asshole down.

512
00:33:42,752 --> 00:33:46,656
Now put the body in a blanket
and in the back of your truck,

513
00:33:46,690 --> 00:33:47,758
now.

514
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:49,826
We're contaminating a crime
scene, yuou know that.

515
00:33:49,859 --> 00:33:51,328
I said now.

516
00:33:55,566 --> 00:33:56,567
Go, Nancy.

517
00:34:03,874 --> 00:34:05,809
Shit no.

518
00:34:05,843 --> 00:34:08,311
Can't be.

519
00:34:08,344 --> 00:34:11,147
What, you know him?

520
00:34:11,181 --> 00:34:12,182
It's Greg Creighton.

521
00:34:47,317 --> 00:34:50,253
God, don't like it here.

522
00:35:12,643 --> 00:35:14,512
Where the hell is Kelly Jarvis?

523
00:35:22,452 --> 00:35:23,554
Well spit it out, deputy.

524
00:35:23,586 --> 00:35:25,523
It's a simple question.

525
00:35:25,556 --> 00:35:27,358
I'm sorry, ma'am.

526
00:35:27,391 --> 00:35:28,192
You are?

527
00:35:28,224 --> 00:35:30,927
Ann Creighton,
from San Francisco.

528
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:34,731
My husband Greg Creighton
has just been murdered.

529
00:35:34,764 --> 00:35:36,533
I'm sorry for your loss, ma'am.

530
00:35:36,567 --> 00:35:37,902
It's Ms. Creighton.

531
00:35:37,934 --> 00:35:38,869
Don't call me ma'am.

532
00:35:38,902 --> 00:35:42,539
Do I really look like
a dried up old hag?

533
00:35:42,572 --> 00:35:45,643
Yeah... I
mean, no ma'am... I mean, Mrs...

534
00:35:45,675 --> 00:35:47,244
Ms. Creighton.

535
00:35:47,277 --> 00:35:49,146
Sheriff will be back
here lickity-split.

536
00:35:51,914 --> 00:35:55,286
Ma'am, there's no
smoking on the, premises,

537
00:35:55,318 --> 00:35:56,487
Ms. Creighton.

538
00:35:56,519 --> 00:35:58,889
I'm sure you can
afford a grieving

539
00:35:58,922 --> 00:36:00,490
widow a little nicotine, yes?

540
00:36:00,523 --> 00:36:01,891
Now, be a gentleman.

541
00:36:01,925 --> 00:36:02,860
Fix me a drink.

542
00:36:02,893 --> 00:36:05,496
Sheriff frowns upon
alcohol, Ms. Creighton.

543
00:36:05,528 --> 00:36:06,797
That his office?

544
00:36:06,829 --> 00:36:07,931
Yes it is.

545
00:36:07,965 --> 00:36:10,668
His desk, bottom-right
drawer, and make it a double.

546
00:36:10,701 --> 00:36:11,702
Yes, Ms. Creighton.

547
00:36:16,306 --> 00:36:18,275
Sneaky sheriff.

548
00:36:18,307 --> 00:36:19,710
Should have known.

549
00:36:30,286 --> 00:36:34,657
So deputy, can you
please enlighten me

550
00:36:34,690 --> 00:36:37,660
as to why my husband is dead?

551
00:36:37,693 --> 00:36:40,630
Maybe we should wait until
the sheriff gets back here.

552
00:36:40,664 --> 00:36:42,266
I don't have all the facts yet.

553
00:36:47,704 --> 00:36:48,572
Kelly?

554
00:36:48,605 --> 00:36:49,807
Yeah.

555
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:52,476
My God, Kell.

556
00:36:52,509 --> 00:36:54,711
This can't be happening.

557
00:36:54,744 --> 00:36:56,713
Why, Kelly?

558
00:36:56,746 --> 00:36:58,315
Why?

559
00:37:03,353 --> 00:37:04,755
Let's discuss this in my office.

560
00:37:22,938 --> 00:37:25,009
Was Greg ever
violent towards you?

561
00:37:25,041 --> 00:37:26,844
Wait.

562
00:37:26,876 --> 00:37:28,711
Not, how have you been?

563
00:37:28,744 --> 00:37:29,746
What have you been up to?

564
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:32,716
I'm sorry about
your dead husband.

565
00:37:32,748 --> 00:37:34,484
I don't have time to
spar with you, Ann.

566
00:37:34,518 --> 00:37:35,586
I've got a lot on my plate.

567
00:37:35,619 --> 00:37:36,821
You have no idea.

568
00:37:40,023 --> 00:37:41,057
Here, sign this.

569
00:37:41,090 --> 00:37:42,192
What's this?

570
00:37:42,226 --> 00:37:45,929
It's a consent form to do
an autopsy on Greg's body.

571
00:37:45,961 --> 00:37:49,365
You want to carve out
what's left of my husband?

572
00:37:49,398 --> 00:37:50,701
Jesus.

573
00:37:50,733 --> 00:37:53,536
That's a ghastly request,
even coming from you.

574
00:37:53,570 --> 00:37:54,471
It's important, Ann.

575
00:37:54,503 --> 00:37:57,340
I need you to sign this.

576
00:37:57,373 --> 00:37:59,409
So that's how you want to play?

577
00:38:03,713 --> 00:38:05,849
You've lost your touch, Kelly.

578
00:38:05,882 --> 00:38:08,751
You're not so much fun anymore.

579
00:38:08,784 --> 00:38:10,853
You never answered my question.

580
00:38:10,887 --> 00:38:13,090
The answer is no.

581
00:38:13,123 --> 00:38:17,795
Greg was never violent, nor
did he act like that around me.

582
00:38:17,827 --> 00:38:21,465
Even when he caught us fucking,
he wept like an infant.

583
00:38:21,498 --> 00:38:22,432
It's disgusting.

584
00:38:24,934 --> 00:38:27,670
Go back to San Francisco, Ann.

585
00:38:27,704 --> 00:38:29,740
Today.

586
00:38:29,773 --> 00:38:32,409
I always knew you still
held a torch for me, baby.

587
00:38:32,442 --> 00:38:33,543
Doesn't work anymore, Ann.

588
00:38:41,918 --> 00:38:42,920
Hello.

589
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:48,726
What?

590
00:38:48,759 --> 00:38:50,561
Who the hell's that?

591
00:38:50,594 --> 00:38:53,697
Greg Creighton's wife.

592
00:38:53,730 --> 00:38:55,865
Well I see she's left
you with a calling card.

593
00:38:59,469 --> 00:39:01,072
The ma... the mayor's here.

594
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:08,512
I need to have a little chat
with the Sheriff, Mary Alma.

595
00:39:08,545 --> 00:39:10,947
And where's the
goddamn autopsy report?

596
00:39:10,981 --> 00:39:13,017
We just got approval
from the victim's wife.

597
00:39:15,851 --> 00:39:16,753
Then get to it.

598
00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:24,560
What the hell did
you bring to my town?

599
00:39:24,594 --> 00:39:26,996
How many dead people
are there, sheriff?

600
00:39:27,030 --> 00:39:29,033
Enlighten me, because
I've lost track.

601
00:39:34,804 --> 00:39:36,005
Where are all the guns?

602
00:39:36,039 --> 00:39:37,941
I can't do my job
without a weapon.

603
00:39:37,974 --> 00:39:40,878
You know, your report said
this Crichton, Creighton fellow,

604
00:39:40,911 --> 00:39:42,413
that he's a buddy of yours?

605
00:39:48,018 --> 00:39:49,519
Not a buddy, an acquaintance.

606
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:03,900
I'm watching you
very, very closely.

607
00:40:03,934 --> 00:40:06,836
You need to be mindful of that.

608
00:40:06,869 --> 00:40:08,072
I have your number.

609
00:40:16,112 --> 00:40:16,914
Yes ma'am.

610
00:40:55,818 --> 00:40:56,420
Hey.

611
00:40:56,452 --> 00:40:57,621
I want to see the autopsy.

612
00:40:57,653 --> 00:41:00,056
Kelly, what are you doing here?

613
00:41:00,090 --> 00:41:02,960
I wanted to see Greg's
autopsy...

614
00:41:02,992 --> 00:41:04,561
Come on.

615
00:41:04,594 --> 00:41:06,230
I'm going to get you
something for that.

616
00:41:06,262 --> 00:41:09,833
Come on.

617
00:41:09,865 --> 00:41:12,768
I'm so sick of that damn cold.

618
00:41:12,802 --> 00:41:13,771
Sit down.

619
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:25,915
Here.

620
00:41:25,949 --> 00:41:27,550
I'll see you tonight, OK?

621
00:41:44,166 --> 00:41:45,735
Can you stop doing that?

622
00:41:45,768 --> 00:41:48,170
It's driving me crazy.

623
00:41:48,204 --> 00:41:49,006
Helps me think.

624
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:58,849
You all right?
What's wrong?

625
00:41:58,882 --> 00:42:00,817
It's my stomach.

626
00:42:00,849 --> 00:42:03,219
I'm under so much
stress right now.

627
00:42:03,253 --> 00:42:06,757
I have my period to top it off.

628
00:42:06,789 --> 00:42:08,192
It's so excruciating.

629
00:42:11,193 --> 00:42:14,697
Why didn't you let me in
Greg Creighton's autopsy?

630
00:42:14,731 --> 00:42:17,668
Because an autopsy's
a very personal thing.

631
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:19,336
I think halting
the killing around

632
00:42:19,369 --> 00:42:24,041
here is a little more important
than a dead man's feelings.

633
00:42:24,074 --> 00:42:28,612
So this Ann Creighton
person... you were close?

634
00:42:28,644 --> 00:42:29,847
Where'd that come from?

635
00:42:33,983 --> 00:42:34,851
We have history.

636
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:36,887
Exactly what's that
supposed to mean?

637
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:37,887
It was a lifetime ago.

638
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:38,422
Forget about it.

639
00:42:38,454 --> 00:42:39,355
You sleep with her?

640
00:42:39,389 --> 00:42:40,923
What's with the fifth degree?

641
00:42:40,956 --> 00:42:42,792
Just tell me about the autopsy.

642
00:42:42,826 --> 00:42:45,061
How come you're not giving
me any straight answers?

643
00:42:49,298 --> 00:42:50,434
Jesus.

644
00:42:50,467 --> 00:42:52,235
You had an affair with her
while she was still married.

645
00:42:52,268 --> 00:42:54,204
It's not what you think.

646
00:42:56,206 --> 00:42:57,740
You still have feelings for her?

647
00:42:57,773 --> 00:42:59,710
It's not like that.

648
00:42:59,742 --> 00:43:00,677
I can't explain it.

649
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:02,079
Then let's just
leave this town.

650
00:43:02,112 --> 00:43:04,947
Go somewhere. I don't care
where we go, anywhere.

651
00:43:04,981 --> 00:43:05,749
How?

652
00:43:05,782 --> 00:43:06,149
Where?

653
00:43:06,181 --> 00:43:06,949
What?

654
00:43:06,983 --> 00:43:08,352
You're upside-down
in your house.

655
00:43:08,385 --> 00:43:10,687
I have a small
stash saved, and I'm

656
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:11,954
sure you have a rainy day fund.

657
00:43:11,987 --> 00:43:13,356
You've lived here
your whole life.

658
00:43:13,389 --> 00:43:16,092
Exactly Kelly, I'm
willing to leave it all.

659
00:43:16,126 --> 00:43:17,628
You have no ties.

660
00:43:17,661 --> 00:43:19,396
You've only been
here for two months.

661
00:43:19,429 --> 00:43:21,965
You don't owe this
miserable place anything.

662
00:43:21,998 --> 00:43:24,333
Mary Alma, we're professionals.

663
00:43:24,367 --> 00:43:27,371
It's our job to
save people's lives.

664
00:43:27,403 --> 00:43:29,072
Then we suck at out
jobs then, right?

665
00:43:32,041 --> 00:43:33,043
I'll be right back.

666
00:43:39,382 --> 00:43:41,351
I'm not going to say anything.

667
00:44:07,376 --> 00:44:09,846
Damn it Kelly, I
told you to stop

668
00:44:09,878 --> 00:44:11,315
slamming the door like that.

669
00:44:15,284 --> 00:44:16,752
Gus?

670
00:44:16,786 --> 00:44:18,889
Gus, what's wrong?

671
00:44:19,922 --> 00:44:21,223
Gus, my God.

672
00:44:21,257 --> 00:44:22,759
Kelly, Gus needs help!

673
00:44:22,791 --> 00:44:23,693
Come here!

674
00:44:23,726 --> 00:44:24,760
My God, Gus.

675
00:44:24,793 --> 00:44:25,761
Stay back!

676
00:44:25,795 --> 00:44:26,363
Gus, stay back.

677
00:44:26,396 --> 00:44:27,164
Don't touch me Gus.

678
00:44:27,197 --> 00:44:28,765
Stop, don't touch me!

679
00:44:28,797 --> 00:44:31,167
Gus, stop!

680
00:44:31,201 --> 00:44:32,769
No, leave me alone Gus!

681
00:44:32,802 --> 00:44:33,269
Stop!

682
00:44:33,302 --> 00:44:34,770
Get away from me!

683
00:44:34,804 --> 00:44:36,173
Go away!

684
00:44:36,206 --> 00:44:39,175
Stop it Gus!

685
00:44:39,208 --> 00:44:40,777
My God!

686
00:44:40,809 --> 00:44:42,746
My God!

687
00:44:42,778 --> 00:44:44,748
Gus, get off her!

688
00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:46,148
God damn it, Gus.

689
00:44:46,181 --> 00:44:47,183
Not you too!

690
00:44:54,990 --> 00:44:55,793
Kelly!

691
00:45:10,773 --> 00:45:11,741
It's OK.

692
00:45:11,775 --> 00:45:15,177
It's OK.

693
00:45:29,958 --> 00:45:36,532
I'll tell you what Mary Alma,
I do not trust the sheriff.

694
00:45:37,266 --> 00:45:38,835
I think he's hiding something.

695
00:45:42,237 --> 00:45:46,108
Mayor, I'm going to need a
full blood and fecal sample

696
00:45:46,141 --> 00:45:47,977
from your cows please,
as soon as possible,

697
00:45:48,010 --> 00:45:50,413
and a full inspection
of the Grill.

698
00:45:50,445 --> 00:45:52,848
Mary Alma.

699
00:45:52,882 --> 00:45:55,184
You're not the FDA.

700
00:45:55,217 --> 00:45:59,221
Besides, my cows are fine.

701
00:45:59,255 --> 00:46:02,925
They're healthy, they
are not the problem here.

702
00:46:02,958 --> 00:46:04,860
Now I'll tell you what though.

703
00:46:04,893 --> 00:46:05,528
Listen.

704
00:46:05,561 --> 00:46:07,864
Listen, listen.

705
00:46:07,896 --> 00:46:09,231
Kelly.

706
00:46:09,264 --> 00:46:11,167
That's who you need
to be investigating.

707
00:46:11,201 --> 00:46:12,302
I have, Mayor.

708
00:46:12,335 --> 00:46:13,903
I'm testing everyone,
including you.

709
00:46:13,936 --> 00:46:15,072
You're not exempt from this.

710
00:46:27,650 --> 00:46:32,989
I do love the feel and sound of
a cocking revolver in my hand.

711
00:46:33,021 --> 00:46:37,159
It gives one such
feeling of power.

712
00:46:37,193 --> 00:46:41,431
Now you need to
listen to me, bitch.

713
00:46:41,463 --> 00:46:45,168
I know that you're
fucking the sheriff.

714
00:46:45,201 --> 00:46:51,942
But you will aim your
investigation his way.

715
00:46:51,974 --> 00:46:53,442
I got it, Mayor.

716
00:46:53,476 --> 00:46:54,544
Good.

717
00:46:54,577 --> 00:46:57,447
Because you know
I mean business.

718
00:47:00,048 --> 00:47:01,451
Who else is here?

719
00:47:01,483 --> 00:47:02,451
Who else is here?

720
00:47:02,485 --> 00:47:03,519
I don't know.

721
00:47:03,552 --> 00:47:05,888
Besides the piles of dead
bodies, I don't know.

722
00:47:21,070 --> 00:47:23,539
I hope you remember
what I said, Mary Alma.

723
00:47:28,978 --> 00:47:30,646
Excuse me, ma'am.

724
00:47:30,679 --> 00:47:31,581
How rude.

725
00:47:34,617 --> 00:47:36,219
Doctor, I presume?

726
00:47:36,251 --> 00:47:37,452
Please, sit down.

727
00:47:37,487 --> 00:47:43,159
I'm very sorry for your
loss Miss Creighton... Ann...

728
00:47:43,192 --> 00:47:45,594
but there is no smoking
in the building.

729
00:47:45,628 --> 00:47:47,597
It's making a comeback, doc.

730
00:47:47,630 --> 00:47:49,099
Get used to it.

731
00:47:49,132 --> 00:47:51,434
Besides, without disease
you'd be unemployed, yes?

732
00:47:54,269 --> 00:47:57,974
I hope my husband's body wasn't
too much trouble for you.

733
00:47:58,007 --> 00:48:02,979
Did you find anything odd, apart
from his teensy-weensy dick?

734
00:48:03,012 --> 00:48:05,048
I'm still putting the
pieces together, Ann.

735
00:48:05,081 --> 00:48:08,385
If that's doctor humor, I don't
find it particularly funny.

736
00:48:08,418 --> 00:48:08,952
Sorry.

737
00:48:08,985 --> 00:48:11,387
It's been a long day.

738
00:48:11,420 --> 00:48:16,592
Well, you'll have to give me a tour
of this lovely little town of yours.

739
00:48:16,626 --> 00:48:18,495
It's not a good time, Ann.

740
00:48:18,527 --> 00:48:19,395
You might be next.

741
00:48:19,429 --> 00:48:21,197
This is really dangerous.

742
00:48:21,230 --> 00:48:23,365
What did you say to me?

743
00:48:23,398 --> 00:48:26,603
Was your husband around any
strange type of chemicals

744
00:48:26,635 --> 00:48:31,141
or meat, foods, consume any meat
besides Mayor's Grill recently?

745
00:48:31,173 --> 00:48:32,474
Well, he measured things.

746
00:48:32,507 --> 00:48:33,542
Calculated junk.

747
00:48:33,576 --> 00:48:35,445
That's all I know.

748
00:48:35,478 --> 00:48:38,447
But yes, most people
do consume meat.

749
00:48:38,481 --> 00:48:40,250
Except for those pansy vegans.

750
00:48:40,282 --> 00:48:42,485
I'm going to need some blood
samples and fecal samples

751
00:48:42,518 --> 00:48:45,288
from you, as soon as possible.

752
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:46,722
Here you are.

753
00:48:46,755 --> 00:48:48,490
Well, if it's going
to move things along

754
00:48:48,523 --> 00:48:52,061
to get this goddamn will sorted,
I'll give you your samples.

755
00:48:55,197 --> 00:48:58,167
Why am I still here?

756
00:49:12,748 --> 00:49:14,350
Come on Mary Alma, think.

757
00:49:17,686 --> 00:49:19,288
Come on Mary Alma.

758
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:26,163
There has to be a connection.

759
00:49:29,798 --> 00:49:31,001
Think.

760
00:49:35,771 --> 00:49:36,974
Wait a second.

761
00:49:41,777 --> 00:49:43,312
You know Mayor,
I really love what

762
00:49:43,346 --> 00:49:44,380
you've done with this place.

763
00:49:44,414 --> 00:49:45,515
You know, I just give
the people what they want.

764
00:49:45,547 --> 00:49:49,351
A nice, well-cooked beef
that just falls off the bone.

765
00:49:49,385 --> 00:49:50,253
Bone.

766
00:49:50,286 --> 00:49:51,153
Bone.

767
00:49:51,186 --> 00:49:53,655
Bone.

768
00:49:53,688 --> 00:49:58,427
Betty Hays was
menstruating like I was.

769
00:49:58,460 --> 00:50:01,630
Only the women are
being attacked.

770
00:50:01,664 --> 00:50:04,200
The people are only
attacking after the eat

771
00:50:04,233 --> 00:50:06,169
at the Mayor's Grill.

772
00:50:06,202 --> 00:50:10,407
There has to be a
connection between the meat

773
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:12,642
and the women's menstruation.

774
00:50:12,675 --> 00:50:14,110
That's it.

775
00:50:14,143 --> 00:50:15,378
My God, that's it.

776
00:50:15,411 --> 00:50:17,579
Kelly.

777
00:50:17,612 --> 00:50:20,416
Kelly, pick up.

778
00:50:20,449 --> 00:50:22,818
Shit.

779
00:50:34,496 --> 00:50:36,565
You're safe, Gus.

780
00:50:39,202 --> 00:50:39,803
Easy, Gus.

781
00:50:39,835 --> 00:50:40,769
Easy.

782
00:50:41,704 --> 00:50:44,240
We're not
going to hurt you.

783
00:50:44,273 --> 00:50:46,142
Just tell me what happened.

784
00:50:46,175 --> 00:50:52,282
My head... there's
others... it's crawling.

785
00:50:52,315 --> 00:50:55,217
It's crawling away.

786
00:50:55,251 --> 00:50:57,054
Why did you break in
and attack Mary Alma?

787
00:50:59,789 --> 00:51:02,525
It's crawling.

788
00:51:02,557 --> 00:51:05,795
Something... something was...

789
00:51:05,827 --> 00:51:06,829
What did you smell, Gus?

790
00:51:06,862 --> 00:51:07,696
What was it?

791
00:51:11,434 --> 00:51:14,237
Get away from me.

792
00:51:16,204 --> 00:51:17,340
You're safe now.

793
00:51:17,373 --> 00:51:20,275
You're safe now, Gus.

794
00:52:11,793 --> 00:52:13,395
Kelly?

795
00:52:13,429 --> 00:52:14,230
What's wrong?

796
00:52:15,264 --> 00:52:16,231
No.

797
00:52:16,264 --> 00:52:17,266
Not you too.

798
00:52:43,992 --> 00:52:46,563
Mary Alma!

799
00:52:46,596 --> 00:52:49,364
Get me out of these cuffs!

800
00:52:49,398 --> 00:52:52,936
Mary Alma, I'm not playing.

801
00:52:52,969 --> 00:52:54,637
Kelly,
you became possessed

802
00:52:54,670 --> 00:52:57,273
like the rest of them.

803
00:52:57,306 --> 00:52:59,175
We should have left
when we had the chance.

804
00:53:04,746 --> 00:53:05,714
Shit, Kelly!

805
00:53:10,987 --> 00:53:13,489
Kelly, breathe.

806
00:53:13,521 --> 00:53:15,757
Now you should breathe.

807
00:53:15,791 --> 00:53:16,793
Breathe.

808
00:53:19,394 --> 00:53:21,630
Breathe.

809
00:53:21,664 --> 00:53:22,532
OK.

810
00:53:22,565 --> 00:53:23,766
What's wrong with me?

811
00:53:23,798 --> 00:53:24,766
Am I possessed?

812
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:26,869
OK, I need you to... Kelly!

813
00:53:29,005 --> 00:53:31,240
It's like a, a scent.

814
00:53:31,273 --> 00:53:32,976
It's like a scent.

815
00:53:33,009 --> 00:53:35,478
A scent, OK.

816
00:53:35,510 --> 00:53:38,413
Stomach felt really weird.

817
00:53:38,447 --> 00:53:42,585
I felt... fear.

818
00:53:42,617 --> 00:53:43,920
Desire.

819
00:53:43,952 --> 00:53:47,289
It was primitive.

820
00:53:47,322 --> 00:53:50,326
Almost animalistic.

821
00:53:50,358 --> 00:53:53,663
OK, so now we have
a common denominator.

822
00:53:53,695 --> 00:53:55,964
A scent.

823
00:54:06,775 --> 00:54:08,978
What the hell are
you doing here?

824
00:54:09,010 --> 00:54:10,612
Well... How did you get in here?

825
00:54:10,646 --> 00:54:15,051
I have access to
everything in my town.

826
00:54:15,083 --> 00:54:19,554
What in the hell
is on your face?

827
00:54:19,588 --> 00:54:20,957
More importantly,
what are you going

828
00:54:20,989 --> 00:54:24,793
to do to get my
town back on track?

829
00:54:24,827 --> 00:54:28,431
Right now I've got nothing.

830
00:54:28,463 --> 00:54:30,500
Nothing?

831
00:54:30,532 --> 00:54:35,904
Kelly, I have rapes and
murders and suicides going on

832
00:54:35,938 --> 00:54:38,740
out there, and you have
the fucking audacity

833
00:54:38,773 --> 00:54:42,045
to say "nothing" to me?

834
00:54:42,077 --> 00:54:47,684
What I mean is, I don't have
a criminal to lock up just yet.

835
00:54:47,717 --> 00:54:49,885
I know.
How 'bout you?

836
00:54:49,918 --> 00:54:51,653
What are you
talking about, Mayor?

837
00:54:51,686 --> 00:54:54,356
I know a lot more
than you think I do.

838
00:54:54,389 --> 00:54:56,058
You're not going to
slither out of this one

839
00:54:56,092 --> 00:54:59,528
and go off and
collect unemployment.

840
00:54:59,561 --> 00:55:01,797
Some of the women are
probably leaving a scent.

841
00:55:04,467 --> 00:55:05,101
A scent?

842
00:55:05,134 --> 00:55:05,934
A scent.

843
00:55:05,967 --> 00:55:06,501
OK.

844
00:55:06,534 --> 00:55:08,403
That's your lead then?

845
00:55:08,436 --> 00:55:09,672
OK, yeah.

846
00:55:09,704 --> 00:55:12,708
That's the best that a big city
cop like you can come up with?

847
00:55:12,742 --> 00:55:17,547
That there's some scent out
there, and the men in my town

848
00:55:17,579 --> 00:55:21,550
are going to wear this
stupid thing on their face,

849
00:55:21,583 --> 00:55:24,052
and that's going to
stop the carnage.

850
00:55:24,085 --> 00:55:26,521
Some of the men have parasites.

851
00:55:26,554 --> 00:55:28,824
Mary Alma's doing a workup
on the women at the clinic.

852
00:55:28,858 --> 00:55:29,826
Mary Alma.

853
00:55:29,858 --> 00:55:31,059
OK, OK.

854
00:55:31,092 --> 00:55:33,128
Have you noticed that
there's no townspeople?

855
00:55:33,161 --> 00:55:34,364
I've looked everywhere.

856
00:55:34,396 --> 00:55:36,099
I can't find anybody.

857
00:55:36,132 --> 00:55:38,400
You know what I've noticed?

858
00:55:38,434 --> 00:55:42,004
That this all started
happening when you happened

859
00:55:42,036 --> 00:55:44,506
upon our peaceful little burg.

860
00:55:44,539 --> 00:55:47,110
This is your mess.

861
00:55:47,143 --> 00:55:48,543
Clean it up.

862
00:55:48,577 --> 00:55:49,879
I'm not
done with you yet.

863
00:55:53,882 --> 00:55:56,151
Kelly.

864
00:55:56,184 --> 00:55:58,855
You should never touch
a woman in anger.

865
00:55:58,887 --> 00:56:00,523
You know better than that.

866
00:56:06,929 --> 00:56:07,896
Yes ma'am.

867
00:56:20,476 --> 00:56:21,043
Wait, wait!

868
00:56:21,076 --> 00:56:22,445
Wait.

869
00:56:22,478 --> 00:56:23,246
Let me put on my mask.

870
00:56:23,278 --> 00:56:25,447
Just keep some
space between us.

871
00:56:25,481 --> 00:56:28,484
I don't trust you right now.

872
00:56:28,516 --> 00:56:30,152
Sorry I had to cuff you.

873
00:56:30,186 --> 00:56:31,754
Look, we need to talk.

874
00:56:31,786 --> 00:56:34,423
Keep back, Kelly.

875
00:56:34,456 --> 00:56:37,492
Did you find what
you're looking for?

876
00:56:37,525 --> 00:56:41,029
Looks like I picked an
inopportune time to show up.

877
00:56:41,063 --> 00:56:43,633
Did you find anything odd
about my samples, doc?

878
00:56:43,666 --> 00:56:45,601
What the hell are you
doing back in town, Ann?

879
00:56:45,634 --> 00:56:48,036
You left a message on my
phone saying that you needed

880
00:56:48,070 --> 00:56:49,639
some information about Greg.

881
00:56:49,672 --> 00:56:50,505
Yeah, on the phone.

882
00:56:50,539 --> 00:56:52,542
Not in person.

883
00:56:52,574 --> 00:56:54,009
You have no idea
what the hell you're

884
00:56:54,043 --> 00:56:55,111
in the middle of here, Ann.

885
00:56:55,143 --> 00:56:56,545
A threesome.

886
00:56:56,579 --> 00:56:59,015
I like how your mind works.

887
00:56:59,047 --> 00:57:00,582
If you knew what
was good for you,

888
00:57:00,615 --> 00:57:02,751
you'd get your sexual
tail out of town.

889
00:57:02,784 --> 00:57:04,753
Well maybe I'm not like you.

890
00:57:04,786 --> 00:57:07,622
I enjoy a bit of danger.

891
00:57:07,655 --> 00:57:08,824
You're a fool.

892
00:57:08,856 --> 00:57:11,059
You need to come with me,
unless you'd prefer to be dead.

893
00:57:11,092 --> 00:57:13,762
If you know what's good for
you, you will come with me.

894
00:57:13,795 --> 00:57:15,697
I need to discuss some
things with the sheriff

895
00:57:15,731 --> 00:57:18,634
if you don't mind.

896
00:57:18,666 --> 00:57:20,635
I can't believe you too.

897
00:57:20,668 --> 00:57:22,605
Born from the same bowel.

898
00:57:22,637 --> 00:57:25,007
Mary Alma, wait.

899
00:57:25,039 --> 00:57:27,009
Well she's the life
of the party?

900
00:57:27,041 --> 00:57:29,978
What is this ridiculous
thing on your face?

901
00:57:30,012 --> 00:57:32,981
Jesus Christ Ann,
what are you...

902
00:57:33,014 --> 00:57:34,583
doing?

903
00:57:34,617 --> 00:57:36,586
You want me out of harm's way?

904
00:57:36,619 --> 00:57:38,954
Your place is the safest, right?

905
00:57:38,987 --> 00:57:40,956
Just go with Mary Alma, please.

906
00:57:40,989 --> 00:57:43,558
I'm not going anywhere.

907
00:57:43,592 --> 00:57:48,931
My dead husband... God rest
his soul... has life insurance.

908
00:57:48,963 --> 00:57:51,099
We can go anywhere.

909
00:57:51,132 --> 00:57:56,271
You and me, like we
dreamed of years ago.

910
00:57:56,304 --> 00:57:57,940
Ann, I just can't leave.

911
00:57:57,972 --> 00:58:00,242
Not with everything that's
happening in the town.

912
00:58:00,275 --> 00:58:02,978
You're so much more
than your job, Kell.

913
00:58:03,012 --> 00:58:05,981
And this shit hole of a town.

914
00:58:06,014 --> 00:58:08,817
We can do so much
better than this.

915
00:58:29,771 --> 00:58:31,139
You're so far away, baby.

916
00:58:31,172 --> 00:58:32,707
Come here.

917
00:58:32,740 --> 00:58:34,576
I'm lonely.

918
00:58:34,610 --> 00:58:38,146
Ann, I... I could kill you.

919
00:58:46,322 --> 00:58:48,858
Take the mask off.

920
00:58:48,891 --> 00:58:51,293
It doesn't look like
it does anything.

921
00:58:51,327 --> 00:58:53,029
Besides, it looks stupid.

922
00:58:53,061 --> 00:58:54,896
You've nuts, you know that?

923
00:58:54,929 --> 00:58:56,765
I could kill you.

924
00:58:56,798 --> 00:59:00,635
Well, let's play it
like an experiment.

925
00:59:00,668 --> 00:59:03,638
Stop it, Ann.

926
00:59:03,672 --> 00:59:06,208
Ann.

927
00:59:07,041 --> 00:59:08,143
What the hell?

928
00:59:08,177 --> 00:59:09,979
Let me go.

929
00:59:10,012 --> 00:59:13,215
Now I've got you
right where I want you.

930
00:59:13,248 --> 00:59:16,052
Damn it, Ann.

931
00:59:16,085 --> 00:59:17,887
Ann, let me go.

932
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:22,191
Come on, that used
to drive you nuts.

933
00:59:22,224 --> 00:59:25,094
Ann, I can't do this.

934
00:59:25,126 --> 00:59:26,862
I'm gonna devour
you whole right now.

935
00:59:36,739 --> 00:59:37,340
No...

936
00:59:41,043 --> 00:59:44,213
Deep breaths.

937
00:59:44,246 --> 00:59:45,181
Breath deep.

938
00:59:54,123 --> 00:59:54,956
Nothing, right?

939
00:59:54,989 --> 00:59:55,991
You feel OK?

940
00:59:59,827 --> 01:00:01,697
I smell something.

941
01:00:01,730 --> 01:00:02,731
What?

942
01:00:05,967 --> 01:00:07,969
Perfume.

943
01:00:08,003 --> 01:00:10,373
You bought this
for me, remember?

944
01:00:10,405 --> 01:00:12,273
Yeah, I do.

945
01:00:12,306 --> 01:00:13,808
Ann, don't.

946
01:00:13,842 --> 01:00:16,244
Something's definitely
coming to life.

947
01:00:16,277 --> 01:00:17,279
No.

948
01:00:19,882 --> 01:00:21,751
Someone's coming, Ann.

949
01:00:25,153 --> 01:00:26,389
Someone's here.

950
01:00:26,422 --> 01:00:29,824
Ann, uncuff me.

951
01:00:29,858 --> 01:00:35,164
Kelly, I found... what
the hell is going on here?

952
01:00:35,197 --> 01:00:37,233
You're supposed to be
locking the men up!

953
01:00:37,266 --> 01:00:38,768
Mary Alma, nothing happened.

954
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:42,203
I swear to God.

955
01:00:42,237 --> 01:00:46,142
Keep that on.

956
01:00:46,175 --> 01:00:48,943
I should hit you.

957
01:00:48,976 --> 01:00:51,413
That stupid piece of paper
is always glued to your hand.

958
01:00:51,447 --> 01:00:52,882
Is that some sort of fetish?

959
01:00:52,914 --> 01:00:55,784
Shut your mouth, Ann.

960
01:00:55,818 --> 01:00:58,421
Don't you dare look
at me like that.

961
01:00:58,454 --> 01:00:59,922
Are you gonna
uncuff him or is he

962
01:00:59,954 --> 01:01:01,423
going to sit there
the whole night?

963
01:01:01,456 --> 01:01:03,925
Get fucked, Mary Alma.

964
01:01:03,958 --> 01:01:06,094
Are you going to let
her talk to me like that?

965
01:01:06,128 --> 01:01:08,030
Ann, shut it.

966
01:01:12,134 --> 01:01:14,737
Mary Alma... wait.

967
01:01:14,769 --> 01:01:16,739
I can't find any
of the townspeople.

968
01:01:16,771 --> 01:01:19,040
Dead or alive.

969
01:01:19,074 --> 01:01:20,276
Where are the bodies?

970
01:01:20,309 --> 01:01:22,945
Get back, and don't touch me.

971
01:01:25,947 --> 01:01:28,750
I thought I knew you.

972
01:01:28,784 --> 01:01:30,052
How could you do this to me?

973
01:01:30,085 --> 01:01:32,221
Look, I'm sorry,
but nothing happened.

974
01:01:32,253 --> 01:01:36,491
I just haven't
been myself lately.

975
01:01:36,525 --> 01:01:38,728
Are you on your period?

976
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:39,295
Excuse me?

977
01:01:39,327 --> 01:01:42,163
Are you menstruating?

978
01:01:42,197 --> 01:01:43,865
You know something.

979
01:01:43,898 --> 01:01:46,101
What is it?
Tell me.

980
01:01:46,135 --> 01:01:48,237
Tell me, Mary Alma.

981
01:01:48,269 --> 01:01:49,472
Mary Alma?

982
01:01:49,505 --> 01:01:50,439
Get over to the Grill.

983
01:01:50,472 --> 01:01:51,974
I've got some...

984
01:01:52,007 --> 01:01:55,211
Mayor, is that you?

985
01:01:55,244 --> 01:01:58,047
Mayor, can you hear me?

986
01:01:58,079 --> 01:01:59,315
Don't just stand there, asshole!

987
01:01:59,347 --> 01:02:00,983
Get your shit together!

988
01:02:01,016 --> 01:02:04,920
Mary Alma, wait.

989
01:02:04,952 --> 01:02:05,454
What about me?

990
01:02:05,487 --> 01:02:07,356
What should I do?

991
01:02:07,389 --> 01:02:10,092
Kelly, get back here.

992
01:02:10,125 --> 01:02:12,027
Kelly, don't leave
me, not again.

993
01:02:14,396 --> 01:02:15,932
I hate this flea-bitten town.

994
01:02:42,291 --> 01:02:43,259
Good God, Gus.

995
01:02:43,291 --> 01:02:45,260
What have they done to you?

996
01:02:45,293 --> 01:02:50,266
Damn it, now I gotta
get a new deputy.

997
01:02:50,298 --> 01:02:51,300
Time to be proactive.

998
01:03:25,233 --> 01:03:27,202
Hello?

999
01:03:27,235 --> 01:03:28,237
Mayor?

1000
01:03:51,626 --> 01:03:54,596
How did you get out?

1001
01:03:54,630 --> 01:03:57,566
Stay right there, Gus.

1002
01:03:57,599 --> 01:03:59,568
Don't make me hit you.

1003
01:03:59,601 --> 01:04:00,869
Please.
Help me.

1004
01:04:01,603 --> 01:04:02,605
Please.

1005
01:05:10,505 --> 01:05:13,474
Mary Alma?

1006
01:05:13,507 --> 01:05:15,510
Mary Alma, you in here?

1007
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:39,300
Where am I?

1008
01:05:39,333 --> 01:05:41,202
Exactly where you should be.

1009
01:05:41,235 --> 01:05:42,670
In custody.

1010
01:05:42,704 --> 01:05:45,307
I don't understand what
you're babbling about.

1011
01:05:45,340 --> 01:05:49,044
You're a scoundrel in the first
degree, Kelly, and you know it.

1012
01:05:49,077 --> 01:05:53,048
But you can redeem your soul
by signing this confession.

1013
01:05:54,315 --> 01:06:00,188
I'm not signing any of your
illegal documents, Jesus Mayor,

1014
01:06:00,222 --> 01:06:02,424
admit what you've done.

1015
01:06:02,456 --> 01:06:04,192
You're the cause
of all this carnage

1016
01:06:04,226 --> 01:06:05,427
I've been trying to stop.

1017
01:06:05,460 --> 01:06:08,262
I'm the one that's been trying
to put this town on the map,

1018
01:06:08,295 --> 01:06:10,431
and you ruined it in
less than two months.

1019
01:06:10,465 --> 01:06:12,568
You killed all
those people, Kelly,

1020
01:06:12,601 --> 01:06:14,570
and the forensics proves it.

1021
01:06:30,418 --> 01:06:32,788
You have
got to be kidding me.

1022
01:06:32,820 --> 01:06:33,755
Finally, thank you.

1023
01:06:33,789 --> 01:06:37,526
My damn cell phone has
no service out here.

1024
01:06:37,559 --> 01:06:39,228
It had to be you, didn't it?

1025
01:06:39,260 --> 01:06:40,628
What are you still doing, Ann?

1026
01:06:40,661 --> 01:06:44,599
Two words... no gas stations.

1027
01:06:44,632 --> 01:06:45,500
Get in.

1028
01:06:45,534 --> 01:06:46,568
Hell no.
Are you crazy?

1029
01:06:46,601 --> 01:06:47,769
I'm not leaving
my car out there.

1030
01:06:47,802 --> 01:06:48,903
Those rims?

1031
01:06:48,938 --> 01:06:51,073
They set me back more than
you make in a year, honey.

1032
01:06:51,106 --> 01:06:53,509
You don't get it, do you?

1033
01:06:53,541 --> 01:06:55,576
People have been
raped and killed.

1034
01:06:55,610 --> 01:06:56,711
You may be next.

1035
01:06:56,744 --> 01:07:00,081
Your husband and my best
friend... what are you doing?

1036
01:07:00,114 --> 01:07:02,350
You need to get in the
car, or else I'm leaving.

1037
01:07:05,820 --> 01:07:07,456
OK, but that lady-man
friend of yours

1038
01:07:07,489 --> 01:07:09,391
needs to invest in some
fucking gas stations.

1039
01:07:09,423 --> 01:07:10,425
You need to stop.

1040
01:07:18,266 --> 01:07:20,135
We should probably
go around back.

1041
01:07:28,610 --> 01:07:29,478
Where are you going?

1042
01:07:29,510 --> 01:07:30,679
I'm coming with you.

1043
01:07:33,782 --> 01:07:35,717
You know what?
Maybe it is better that you are.

1044
01:07:35,750 --> 01:07:38,086
You know, karma, or
something like it.

1045
01:07:47,461 --> 01:07:49,664
Kelly?

1046
01:07:49,697 --> 01:07:51,732
Kelly, are you in here?

1047
01:07:51,766 --> 01:07:54,202
Breaking and
entering, Mary Alma?

1048
01:07:54,235 --> 01:07:56,170
Didn't think
you had it in you.

1049
01:07:56,204 --> 01:07:58,640
These keys belong to my
friend who used to work here,

1050
01:07:58,672 --> 01:07:59,707
and she's dead.

1051
01:07:59,740 --> 01:08:01,342
Watch what you say.

1052
01:08:01,376 --> 01:08:03,445
Keep your eyes peeled for Mayor.

1053
01:08:03,478 --> 01:08:06,315
That big honky-tonk lady-man?

1054
01:08:06,347 --> 01:08:09,317
I don't like her much either.

1055
01:08:09,351 --> 01:08:10,686
Stinks in here.

1056
01:08:10,719 --> 01:08:12,287
Yeah Ann.

1057
01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:13,522
Death's been here.

1058
01:08:13,554 --> 01:08:15,456
Maybe I should go wait
in the car after all.

1059
01:08:15,489 --> 01:08:17,760
Park your ass right there
and don't touch anything.

1060
01:08:40,916 --> 01:08:43,819
Where's Kelly when I need him?

1061
01:08:43,851 --> 01:08:45,854
You have a thing for him?

1062
01:08:45,886 --> 01:08:48,789
That is none of
your business, Ann.

1063
01:08:48,823 --> 01:08:51,793
Besides, you are the last person
I would talk to about him.

1064
01:08:51,826 --> 01:08:53,494
You're in love with him.

1065
01:08:53,528 --> 01:08:54,630
I knew it.

1066
01:08:54,662 --> 01:08:56,297
I could tell in the bedroom.

1067
01:08:56,331 --> 01:08:59,201
There's a fine line between
hate and love, my dear.

1068
01:08:59,234 --> 01:09:00,769
Trust me, I know.

1069
01:09:09,844 --> 01:09:11,413
This is a crime
scene you idiot.

1070
01:09:11,445 --> 01:09:12,646
Put that damn thing out.

1071
01:09:12,680 --> 01:09:15,817
Well you're just a burst of
energy today then, aren't you?

1072
01:09:19,820 --> 01:09:22,390
Do you hear that?

1073
01:09:22,423 --> 01:09:23,425
No.

1074
01:09:31,832 --> 01:09:32,835
Hurry up.

1075
01:09:46,814 --> 01:09:48,750
Just rip it off.

1076
01:09:48,783 --> 01:09:50,352
Give me that.

1077
01:10:09,770 --> 01:10:10,738
Kelly?

1078
01:10:10,771 --> 01:10:11,739
Kelly, are you there?

1079
01:10:11,773 --> 01:10:14,309
Please pick up.

1080
01:10:14,341 --> 01:10:18,312
Kelly, please, I need you.

1081
01:10:18,345 --> 01:10:20,314
Good
evening Mary Alma.

1082
01:10:20,347 --> 01:10:23,318
Things aren't really
going your way, are they?

1083
01:10:23,350 --> 01:10:25,720
Well, it's gonna
get worse for ya.

1084
01:10:25,753 --> 01:10:27,722
Mayor, where's Kelly?

1085
01:10:27,756 --> 01:10:29,725
He's in custody.

1086
01:10:29,757 --> 01:10:32,728
So listen, I want you to
grab all your evidence...

1087
01:10:32,761 --> 01:10:35,731
and I mean all of it...
and bring it on down

1088
01:10:35,764 --> 01:10:37,699
to the sheriff's station.

1089
01:10:37,731 --> 01:10:40,702
Then we'll talk about
Kelly's release.

1090
01:10:40,734 --> 01:10:43,271
Or, his termination.

1091
01:10:43,305 --> 01:10:46,775
Mayor, it doesn't
have to be like this.

1092
01:10:46,807 --> 01:10:48,743
Mayor, please listen to me.

1093
01:10:48,777 --> 01:10:50,846
It doesn't have to be this way.

1094
01:10:54,082 --> 01:10:57,653
Mayor, can you hear me?

1095
01:10:57,685 --> 01:10:59,054
God damn it, Mayor!

1096
01:10:59,087 --> 01:11:01,556
It doesn't have to be this way.

1097
01:11:01,588 --> 01:11:02,490
Stop!

1098
01:11:02,524 --> 01:11:04,826
Mayor, can you hear me?

1099
01:11:05,859 --> 01:11:08,829
I'm on my way.

1100
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:13,402
Let go of her.

1101
01:11:15,869 --> 01:11:17,972
Get up, get up.

1102
01:11:18,006 --> 01:11:18,974
OK, Ann!

1103
01:11:19,006 --> 01:11:19,940
Pay attention.

1104
01:11:19,974 --> 01:11:21,543
Have you been bit?

1105
01:11:21,576 --> 01:11:22,944
I don't know.

1106
01:11:22,976 --> 01:11:25,514
Come on, come on.

1107
01:11:25,546 --> 01:11:26,914
Come on, hurry.

1108
01:11:26,948 --> 01:11:28,517
Get in.

1109
01:11:28,550 --> 01:11:29,952
Go, get in.

1110
01:11:44,932 --> 01:11:47,903
Hasn't there been
enough death already?

1111
01:11:47,935 --> 01:11:49,503
Listen.

1112
01:11:49,537 --> 01:11:51,773
My great-granddaddy
established this town

1113
01:11:51,805 --> 01:11:54,408
on a lot of blood,
sweat, and tears,

1114
01:11:54,442 --> 01:11:56,877
and I'll be damned if I'm
going to let the economy

1115
01:11:56,911 --> 01:11:59,914
or you destroy it,
you son of a bitch.

1116
01:11:59,948 --> 01:12:01,416
What did you do to your cows?

1117
01:12:01,448 --> 01:12:02,416
Nothing illegal.

1118
01:12:02,449 --> 01:12:04,618
Mayor, people are dead.

1119
01:12:04,652 --> 01:12:06,822
Look, I souped up the
animals a little bit

1120
01:12:06,854 --> 01:12:10,091
to get a more delicious meat,
but it's done all the time.

1121
01:12:10,125 --> 01:12:12,560
It's even in vegetables
and other foods now.

1122
01:12:12,594 --> 01:12:15,430
Everything I bought... the
drugs, the ingredients...

1123
01:12:15,462 --> 01:12:17,099
it's all legal.

1124
01:12:17,131 --> 01:12:19,934
Well obviously,
something went very wrong.

1125
01:12:23,104 --> 01:12:24,773
Put down the gun.

1126
01:12:24,805 --> 01:12:25,706
Let's figure this out.

1127
01:12:25,739 --> 01:12:27,041
There's been enough killing.

1128
01:12:30,511 --> 01:12:31,546
Will you help me, Kelly?

1129
01:12:35,015 --> 01:12:37,385
Tell the authorities that
I didn't do anything wrong?

1130
01:12:37,418 --> 01:12:40,721
Be a witness for me?

1131
01:12:40,755 --> 01:12:43,492
I swear to God, I didn't know
what was causing all this.

1132
01:12:43,524 --> 01:12:47,128
That's why I was having you
guys work so hard on it.

1133
01:12:47,162 --> 01:12:49,064
Look, we can fix this together.

1134
01:12:53,935 --> 01:12:55,804
Some sheriff you are.

1135
01:12:55,837 --> 01:12:59,741
You just got done by
an old woman, pussy.

1136
01:13:02,710 --> 01:13:04,145
Just get me out
of here, Mary Alma.

1137
01:13:04,179 --> 01:13:05,547
I want to go home.

1138
01:13:05,579 --> 01:13:08,149
Did you fucking
see that crazy guy?

1139
01:13:08,182 --> 01:13:10,886
Did you fucking see his eyes?

1140
01:13:10,918 --> 01:13:13,154
I've never seen
anything like it.

1141
01:13:13,188 --> 01:13:15,923
Ann, I don't need
your shit right now.

1142
01:13:15,957 --> 01:13:17,893
I have nothing to do with this.

1143
01:13:17,926 --> 01:13:22,931
I'm not even fucking from this
stupid fucking creepy town.

1144
01:13:22,963 --> 01:13:26,033
Ann, I'm still trying
to figure things out, OK?

1145
01:13:26,067 --> 01:13:27,735
I need you to calm down.

1146
01:13:30,939 --> 01:13:32,574
Where is everybody, Mary Alma?

1147
01:13:32,606 --> 01:13:33,641
Where all the people?

1148
01:13:33,675 --> 01:13:36,578
There's no one around.

1149
01:13:36,610 --> 01:13:38,546
I want to go home, Mary Alma.

1150
01:13:38,579 --> 01:13:39,515
I want to go home.

1151
01:13:44,551 --> 01:13:45,853
I'm pulling over now.

1152
01:13:45,886 --> 01:13:46,854
Get me out of here.

1153
01:13:46,887 --> 01:13:48,189
Get me out of this fucking town.

1154
01:13:48,222 --> 01:13:48,957
Get me out of...

1155
01:13:48,989 --> 01:13:49,858
Stop!

1156
01:13:49,890 --> 01:13:50,625
Get me out of here.

1157
01:13:50,658 --> 01:13:51,927
I want to go home.

1158
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:53,028
Look at me.

1159
01:13:53,060 --> 01:13:55,563
You're going... you're
going to need to calm down.

1160
01:13:55,596 --> 01:13:59,634
I can't do this without you.

1161
01:13:59,667 --> 01:14:01,103
I'm coming with you.

1162
01:14:04,605 --> 01:14:06,640
You're not coming with me.

1163
01:14:06,673 --> 01:14:08,076
You're staying here.

1164
01:14:08,109 --> 01:14:09,544
Don't leave me here, Mary Alma.

1165
01:14:09,577 --> 01:14:10,679
I'm coming fucking with you.

1166
01:14:10,712 --> 01:14:12,214
Ann, you need to stay here.

1167
01:14:12,247 --> 01:14:13,148
Are you kidding me?

1168
01:14:13,181 --> 01:14:15,216
Anything could be
hiding in those bushes.

1169
01:14:15,250 --> 01:14:16,150
Stop, Ann.

1170
01:14:16,184 --> 01:14:17,186
Shut up.

1171
01:14:27,561 --> 01:14:28,630
Stay behind me.

1172
01:14:33,033 --> 01:14:34,969
Kelly, are you in here?

1173
01:14:35,002 --> 01:14:35,936
Go back, Mary Alma.

1174
01:14:35,970 --> 01:14:37,239
It's a trap.

1175
01:14:37,271 --> 01:14:40,074
Mary Alma, get out of here.

1176
01:14:40,108 --> 01:14:40,876
Mayor, let them go.

1177
01:14:40,908 --> 01:14:42,943
They have nothing
to do with this.

1178
01:14:42,976 --> 01:14:44,880
For the record Mayor,
I'm not a part of this.

1179
01:14:44,912 --> 01:14:46,280
I'm a hostage.

1180
01:14:46,314 --> 01:14:49,184
What is this bitch doing here?

1181
01:14:49,216 --> 01:14:50,351
I am not a bitch.

1182
01:14:50,385 --> 01:14:56,056
God Mary Alma, you just have
to complicate everything,

1183
01:14:56,090 --> 01:14:58,994
don't you?

1184
01:14:59,027 --> 01:15:01,128
I've got all the evidence here.

1185
01:15:01,162 --> 01:15:03,597
Open it.

1186
01:15:03,631 --> 01:15:07,269
I said, open it.

1187
01:15:07,301 --> 01:15:10,639
First, let Kelly go.

1188
01:15:10,671 --> 01:15:14,708
Something doesn't seem right.

1189
01:15:14,742 --> 01:15:20,315
If you're deceiving
me, I will kill you.

1190
01:15:20,347 --> 01:15:26,020
Now get over here I
said get over here!

1191
01:15:32,961 --> 01:15:36,565
Is this what's
happening to all the men?

1192
01:15:36,597 --> 01:15:39,701
Where's the mask?

1193
01:15:39,734 --> 01:15:42,804
He's gonna die.

1194
01:15:42,837 --> 01:15:44,773
Because he deserves it.

1195
01:15:44,805 --> 01:15:48,842
He brought this to my town.

1196
01:15:48,876 --> 01:15:52,948
Mayor, you are the
cause of all of this.

1197
01:15:52,980 --> 01:15:54,648
Don't you see?

1198
01:15:54,681 --> 01:15:55,515
He's sick.

1199
01:15:55,550 --> 01:15:57,918
People are dying
because of your meat.

1200
01:15:57,952 --> 01:16:00,188
Your cows, they are infected.

1201
01:16:00,220 --> 01:16:02,356
Everybody is dying
from the meat.

1202
01:16:02,390 --> 01:16:04,659
Don't you see that?

1203
01:16:04,692 --> 01:16:05,793
Goddammit.

1204
01:16:05,827 --> 01:16:06,994
Just give me the mask.

1205
01:16:07,028 --> 01:16:08,296
Here, just take this.

1206
01:16:08,328 --> 01:16:09,230
Give me the mask.

1207
01:16:12,100 --> 01:16:13,001
Give it to me.

1208
01:16:13,034 --> 01:16:15,604
You think you're in
control, Mary Alma.

1209
01:16:16,770 --> 01:16:17,838
But you're not.

1210
01:16:17,872 --> 01:16:20,976
I'm in control.

1211
01:16:21,009 --> 01:16:23,612
What the hell did I do?

1212
01:16:23,645 --> 01:16:27,115
I'm not even from
this fucking town.

1213
01:16:27,148 --> 01:16:28,248
I'm fucking getting out of...

1214
01:16:28,282 --> 01:16:30,018
No!

1215
01:16:30,051 --> 01:16:33,254
Get right back over here.

1216
01:16:33,287 --> 01:16:35,824
Do you want the mask?

1217
01:16:35,856 --> 01:16:42,096
You think the mask is gonna
save your little boyfriend?

1218
01:16:42,130 --> 01:16:43,731
Here.

1219
01:16:43,765 --> 01:16:44,700
Take it.

1220
01:16:48,036 --> 01:16:50,372
He did this.

1221
01:16:52,407 --> 01:16:58,747
I'm not going to lose
my town, Mary Alma.

1222
01:16:59,747 --> 01:17:01,850
It's all over.

1223
01:17:01,882 --> 01:17:05,987
I don't know how it came
to this, but it did.

1224
01:17:06,020 --> 01:17:09,990
There's only one way out.

1225
01:17:10,024 --> 01:17:13,395
I'm not gonna lose my town.

1226
01:17:13,427 --> 01:17:15,729
This is everything to me.

1227
01:17:15,762 --> 01:17:17,332
Do you understand me?

1228
01:17:17,364 --> 01:17:18,367
Everything!

1229
01:17:20,467 --> 01:17:23,203
And then you come
in, and he comes in.

1230
01:17:23,237 --> 01:17:25,306
And I'm gonna lose it all!

1231
01:17:28,042 --> 01:17:31,012
But that's not gonna happen.

1232
01:17:31,045 --> 01:17:34,682
I'm gonna make sure
it doesn't happen.

1233
01:17:34,716 --> 01:17:36,951
Kelly?

1234
01:17:36,984 --> 01:17:38,853
Kelly.

1235
01:17:38,886 --> 01:17:42,356
Come on, have some
dignity you piece of shit.

1236
01:17:42,390 --> 01:17:43,392
Damn it.

1237
01:17:48,962 --> 01:17:50,965
Die, you piece of shit.

1238
01:17:54,368 --> 01:17:56,905
God.

1239
01:18:08,315 --> 01:18:09,283
Stay here.

1240
01:18:09,317 --> 01:18:11,853
Stay there.

1241
01:18:11,886 --> 01:18:12,888
Kelly?

1242
01:18:15,890 --> 01:18:17,859
Kelly?

1243
01:18:17,891 --> 01:18:19,260
Relax.

1244
01:18:19,292 --> 01:18:20,228
Relax.

1245
01:18:21,863 --> 01:18:23,231
OK, OK.

1246
01:18:23,264 --> 01:18:23,832
Breathe.

1247
01:18:23,864 --> 01:18:26,233
It's OK.

1248
01:18:26,266 --> 01:18:29,804
It's OK.

1249
01:18:29,837 --> 01:18:31,806
It's OK.

1250
01:18:31,838 --> 01:18:34,809
It's OK.

1251
01:18:34,841 --> 01:18:37,177
Ann, I need your help.

1252
01:18:37,211 --> 01:18:40,782
Ann... what are you doing?

1253
01:18:40,814 --> 01:18:42,783
Put that gun down.

1254
01:18:42,817 --> 01:18:44,752
Put the gun down, Ann.

1255
01:18:44,786 --> 01:18:46,488
He's gone.

1256
01:18:46,520 --> 01:18:47,956
Look at him.

1257
01:18:47,988 --> 01:18:49,323
Look, he's healing.

1258
01:18:49,356 --> 01:18:51,059
He's got the mask
on and everything.

1259
01:18:51,091 --> 01:18:53,427
He's gonna be fine.

1260
01:18:53,461 --> 01:18:56,030
I'm going to need you to put
that gun down so we can get out

1261
01:18:56,063 --> 01:18:57,832
of here, OK?

1262
01:18:57,864 --> 01:19:02,369
Even if we try and save him,
I don't want him near me.

1263
01:19:02,403 --> 01:19:04,939
Put the gun down.

1264
01:19:04,971 --> 01:19:06,507
I need you to help me
get him out of here

1265
01:19:06,541 --> 01:19:09,244
so we can leave, OK?

1266
01:19:09,277 --> 01:19:12,380
Put the gun down.

1267
01:19:12,412 --> 01:19:16,751
I'm begging you,
put the gun down.

1268
01:19:21,154 --> 01:19:24,091
Kelly, just stay there.

1269
01:19:24,125 --> 01:19:25,793
Come and help me.

1270
01:19:25,827 --> 01:19:26,561
Come on Kelly.

1271
01:19:26,594 --> 01:19:28,563
Come on.
Come on Kelly.

1272
01:19:28,595 --> 01:19:30,531
Come on baby, get up.

1273
01:19:30,564 --> 01:19:31,532
Come on honey.

1274
01:19:31,565 --> 01:19:33,100
It's OK, come on.

1275
01:19:33,134 --> 01:19:34,136
Come on.

1276
01:19:40,041 --> 01:19:41,509
You're going to be OK, honey.

1277
01:19:41,542 --> 01:19:42,143
Just hang in there.

1278
01:19:42,176 --> 01:19:43,278
We're gonna be just fine.

1279
01:19:44,279 --> 01:19:47,148
Thank God that fucking
crazy bitch is dead.

1280
01:19:47,180 --> 01:19:49,049
Ann, shut up.

1281
01:19:49,082 --> 01:19:50,884
We're going to get
you to the clinic, OK?

1282
01:19:50,917 --> 01:19:52,420
Just hang in there.

1283
01:19:52,453 --> 01:19:53,521
Just see if he's shot.

1284
01:19:53,554 --> 01:19:56,324
Just check to see if he's shot.

1285
01:19:56,356 --> 01:19:57,425
It's empty, Mary Alma.

1286
01:19:57,457 --> 01:19:58,425
The fluid's empty.

1287
01:19:58,458 --> 01:19:59,493
He's turning again.

1288
01:19:59,527 --> 01:20:00,929
We're going to the clinic, OK?

1289
01:20:00,962 --> 01:20:02,230
We've gotta get
him out of here.

1290
01:20:02,262 --> 01:20:04,465
We've gotta fucking
pull over, Mary Alma.

1291
01:20:04,497 --> 01:20:06,333
I can't stop it!

1292
01:20:06,367 --> 01:20:08,970
We've gotta just fucking
get out of this town, OK?

1293
01:20:09,002 --> 01:20:10,438
We've got to just
fucking get out of...

1294
01:20:10,470 --> 01:20:11,438
I'm trying!

1295
01:20:11,471 --> 01:20:12,907
We've gotta get
him out of here!

1296
01:20:12,939 --> 01:20:13,841
Pull over!

1297
01:20:13,875 --> 01:20:15,210
He's turning again, Mary Alma!

1298
01:20:15,243 --> 01:20:16,611
He's fucking turning again!

1299
01:20:16,644 --> 01:20:19,380
Stop!

1300
01:20:19,412 --> 01:20:21,215
Pull over!

1301
01:20:21,248 --> 01:20:22,951
Stop the fucking car.

1302
01:20:22,984 --> 01:20:24,319
No Kelly, what are you doing?

1303
01:20:24,351 --> 01:20:25,854
Give it to me.

1304
01:20:25,886 --> 01:20:27,287
My God, he's
got the fucking gun!

1305
01:20:27,320 --> 01:20:28,155
Kelly, stop it now.

1306
01:20:28,189 --> 01:20:30,458
Kelly, drop the gun.

1307
01:20:30,490 --> 01:20:31,326
Drop it.

1308
01:20:31,359 --> 01:20:33,061
Mary Alma, do something!

1309
01:20:33,094 --> 01:20:34,561
Stay with me, Kelly.

1310
01:20:34,595 --> 01:20:35,329
No, what are you...

1311
01:20:35,363 --> 01:20:36,898
My God!

1312
01:20:43,104 --> 01:20:44,072
My God, Kelly.

1313
01:20:44,104 --> 01:20:45,305
My God.

1314
01:20:45,338 --> 01:20:45,739
Kelly?

1315
01:20:45,773 --> 01:20:46,975
Kelly wake up!

1316
01:20:47,007 --> 01:20:47,375
Don't!

1317
01:20:47,408 --> 01:20:48,243
Kelly, no.

1318
01:20:48,275 --> 01:20:49,211
Kelly, please.

1319
01:20:55,115 --> 01:20:56,083
Come on baby, wake up.

1320
01:20:56,117 --> 01:20:58,219
Wake up.

1321
01:20:58,252 --> 01:21:00,154
Come on Kelly, wake up.

1322
01:21:00,186 --> 01:21:02,556
Please, Kelly.

1323
01:21:02,590 --> 01:21:04,158
Come and help me!

1324
01:21:04,190 --> 01:21:05,193
Ann!

1325
01:21:08,162 --> 01:21:10,530
My God, baby!

1326
01:21:10,564 --> 01:21:12,133
My God.

1327
01:21:12,166 --> 01:21:14,534
Ann, come and help me Ann.

1328
01:21:14,568 --> 01:21:15,536
Come and help me.

1329
01:21:15,569 --> 01:21:16,504
Kelly, wake up baby.

1330
01:21:16,537 --> 01:21:17,505
Wake up.
Wake up.

1331
01:21:17,537 --> 01:21:20,140
Come on, wake up.

1332
01:21:23,543 --> 01:21:27,481
Ann, what are you doing?

1333
01:21:27,515 --> 01:21:29,083
Ann, come and help me!

1334
01:21:29,115 --> 01:21:33,453
I'm sorry Mary Alma, but
I can't do it any more.

1335
01:21:33,487 --> 01:21:34,489
I'm so sorry.

1336
01:21:38,091 --> 01:21:39,460
Come on Kelly, come on.

1337
01:21:39,493 --> 01:21:42,497
Baby, come on.

1338
01:21:42,529 --> 01:21:47,032
I'm sorry Mary Alma, but
you brought this on yourself.

1339
01:21:47,033 --> 01:21:48,670
Ann, what are you doing?

1340
01:21:48,703 --> 01:21:49,604
Ann, no!

1341
01:21:56,042 --> 01:21:57,177
Come back and help me!
