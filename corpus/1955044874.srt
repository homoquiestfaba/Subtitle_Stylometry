00:00:57,344 --> 00:00:58,445
<i>Yeah!</i>

3
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:00,311
<i>That's gonna kill you.</i>

4
00:01:10,691 --> 00:01:13,608
So, I got my tongue up this chick's ass...

5
00:01:19,533 --> 00:01:21,501
This woman's already looking like,

6
00:01:21,535 --> 00:01:24,169
"Did I go to the wrong show?"

7
00:01:25,956 --> 00:01:27,755
It's what I do.

8
00:01:29,293 --> 00:01:32,095
It's what you expect.

9
00:01:32,129 --> 00:01:33,480
Women today, right?

10
00:01:33,514 --> 00:01:34,681
You know, pal.

11
00:01:34,715 --> 00:01:36,600
You been going through a lot in your life.

12
00:01:36,634 --> 00:01:38,234
We got a...

13
00:01:38,268 --> 00:01:42,522
We got a lot of
entertainment for you tonight.

14
00:01:42,556 --> 00:01:43,356
Let me ask you something.

15
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:45,158
How old are you? How old are you?

16
00:01:45,192 --> 00:01:45,992
Eighty-two.

17
00:01:46,026 --> 00:01:48,359
Eighty-two fucking years old.

18
00:01:51,482 --> 00:01:53,033
What's that?

19
00:01:53,067 --> 00:01:54,284
I remember when you started.

20
00:01:54,318 --> 00:01:55,619
You remember when I started.

21
00:01:55,653 --> 00:01:58,119
I don't even remember
when I fuckin' started.

22
00:01:59,707 --> 00:02:00,624
You know what I mean?

23
00:02:00,658 --> 00:02:02,509
You seem like a great guy, Joey, really.

24
00:02:02,543 --> 00:02:04,492
We're gonna have a lot
of fun with you tonight.

25
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:08,965
A lot of pussy sittin' right behind ya.

26
00:02:08,999 --> 00:02:12,052
This is not a PG... You like pussy, right?

27
00:02:12,086 --> 00:02:15,336
Yeah, I been through a lot with that shit.

28
00:02:16,423 --> 00:02:17,307
You know what I mean?

29
00:02:17,341 --> 00:02:20,477
Fucking destroys us, don't it?

30
00:02:20,511 --> 00:02:23,029
I can actually remember...

31
00:02:23,063 --> 00:02:25,982
This is fucking nuts.

32
00:02:26,016 --> 00:02:27,067
You know, I don't really like

33
00:02:27,101 --> 00:02:28,985
to talk about my family.

34
00:02:29,019 --> 00:02:30,737
But, like, one time, you know,

35
00:02:30,771 --> 00:02:34,040
I walked in when my mother
came out of the shower.

36
00:02:34,074 --> 00:02:35,875
You know, she was naked.

37
00:02:35,909 --> 00:02:38,912
I'm, like, seven years
old, and I see, like,

38
00:02:38,946 --> 00:02:40,745
the winter bush.

39
00:02:42,116 --> 00:02:43,166
You know what I mean?

40
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,751
And then, uh,

41
00:02:44,785 --> 00:02:47,003
like a little while later, I go,

42
00:02:47,037 --> 00:02:50,872
"Ma, I need to talk to
you about what that was."

43
00:02:51,925 --> 00:02:52,842
You know what I mean?

44
00:02:52,876 --> 00:02:54,344
And she goes, "Oh, that.

45
00:02:54,378 --> 00:02:57,731
"That's just my sponge."

46
00:02:57,765 --> 00:03:02,402
And she's going, "Have
you seen your father?"

47
00:03:02,436 --> 00:03:05,105
And I go, "Well, what's funny is,

48
00:03:05,139 --> 00:03:07,857
"that's why I'm asking
you about that because

49
00:03:07,891 --> 00:03:10,744
"the maid has your sponge
and she's rubbing it

50
00:03:10,778 --> 00:03:13,228
"all over Daddy's face."

51
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:19,784
I mean, I don't know if that was wrong.

52
00:03:22,656 --> 00:03:23,373
Don't get embarrassed.

53
00:03:23,407 --> 00:03:25,091
This isn't that kind of show.

54
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:27,177
This isn't an embarrassing show.

55
00:03:27,211 --> 00:03:28,878
This is the first show that

56
00:03:28,912 --> 00:03:31,381
I'm actually hosting with some of the

57
00:03:31,415 --> 00:03:33,748
craziest comics you'll ever see.

58
00:03:38,806 --> 00:03:40,440
And we're gonna really just have a

59
00:03:40,474 --> 00:03:42,058
good fucking time.

60
00:03:42,092 --> 00:03:43,560
You know what I mean?

61
00:03:43,594 --> 00:03:46,279
Except for maybe you.

62
00:03:46,313 --> 00:03:48,346
Jerk-off face.

63
00:03:49,433 --> 00:03:50,817
You know what's amazing about women?

64
00:03:50,851 --> 00:03:52,235
I will tell you this.

65
00:03:52,269 --> 00:03:54,237
You know, because a
girl would look at a guy

66
00:03:54,271 --> 00:03:55,789
<i>like you with the green shirt</i>

67
00:03:55,823 --> 00:03:58,408
and the nice face, you know?

68
00:03:58,442 --> 00:04:00,660
And what women don't seem to understand...

69
00:04:00,694 --> 00:04:03,079
Like, I know I look like an animal.

70
00:04:03,113 --> 00:04:05,331
I know that.

71
00:04:05,365 --> 00:04:06,499
I dress like an animal,

72
00:04:06,533 --> 00:04:09,135
I act like a fucking animal.

73
00:04:09,169 --> 00:04:11,805
But let me tell you something, girls.

74
00:04:11,839 --> 00:04:14,140
I don't care how nice a guy looks,

75
00:04:14,174 --> 00:04:15,759
if he's in his plaid shirt,

76
00:04:15,793 --> 00:04:17,927
or his striped shirt with his little

77
00:04:17,961 --> 00:04:21,931
Howdy Doody face, whatever the fuck.

78
00:04:21,965 --> 00:04:24,818
All I know is when any guy walks over

79
00:04:24,852 --> 00:04:26,936
to any of you girls and says,

80
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:31,973
"Hi," all he's really thinking is,

81
00:04:35,479 --> 00:04:37,614
Daze, daze, daze.

82
00:04:37,648 --> 00:04:41,534
It's all we're thinking.

83
00:04:41,568 --> 00:04:44,037
I'll be watching you.

84
00:04:44,071 --> 00:04:45,872
But, anyway, we do have a great show.

85
00:04:45,906 --> 00:04:47,123
I wanna get to the show.

86
00:04:47,157 --> 00:04:49,626
We have some of the greatest
comics that I've found.

87
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:51,678
This first guy coming to stage

88
00:04:51,712 --> 00:04:56,132
has a show right now
called "Dopeless Romantic."

89
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:58,883
Let's give it up for Erik Myers.

90
00:05:07,511 --> 00:05:09,813
Oh, shit.

91
00:05:09,847 --> 00:05:12,513
What's up? I'm Bradley Cooper on crack.

92
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:19,239
I am very skinny. Did you notice that?

93
00:05:19,273 --> 00:05:20,990
I moved out to L.A. a year ago.

94
00:05:21,024 --> 00:05:22,992
Everybody in L.A. wants to lose weight.

95
00:05:23,026 --> 00:05:25,578
I've been this skinny for 34 years.

96
00:05:25,612 --> 00:05:28,081
I think it sucks shit.

97
00:05:28,115 --> 00:05:29,916
First of all, do you know
how hard it is as a man

98
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:33,720
to look tough when you weigh 92 pounds.

99
00:05:33,754 --> 00:05:36,756
And it's not fair because I
can't pull off certain looks

100
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:39,893
that a bigger guy can do and look hard.

101
00:05:39,927 --> 00:05:41,895
Like, a big guy can shave his head.

102
00:05:41,929 --> 00:05:46,516
He looks like a badass like Vin Diesel.

103
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:48,434
Last summer, I shaved my head.

104
00:05:48,468 --> 00:05:50,685
People thought I had leukemia.

105
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:54,357
They're like, "How long do you have?"

106
00:05:54,391 --> 00:05:56,057
I'm like, "I don't know."

107
00:05:57,144 --> 00:05:59,727
I'm so cold.

108
00:06:01,448 --> 00:06:03,700
By the way, if you see me after the show

109
00:06:03,734 --> 00:06:05,952
and you tell me I look like somebody,

110
00:06:05,986 --> 00:06:07,203
can you make it somebody attractive,

111
00:06:07,237 --> 00:06:09,622
for the love of God?

112
00:06:09,656 --> 00:06:11,040
Last night after the show,

113
00:06:11,074 --> 00:06:14,711
some drunken asshole saunters up to me

114
00:06:14,745 --> 00:06:16,596
and tells me I look exactly like

115
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:18,913
Gollum from "Lord of the Rings."

116
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:21,634
What?!

117
00:06:21,668 --> 00:06:25,722
That's not even a human
being, you piece of shit.

118
00:06:25,756 --> 00:06:28,892
He's a fucking sock puppet, he's green.

119
00:06:28,926 --> 00:06:31,644
And I'm trying to get
laid, all these hot women.

120
00:06:31,678 --> 00:06:33,563
He's like, "Would you
do a Gollum impression?"

121
00:06:33,597 --> 00:06:35,782
I'm like, "Fuck you."

122
00:06:35,816 --> 00:06:37,317
You want me to run
through the theater like,

123
00:06:37,351 --> 00:06:40,286
"My precious! Ah!"

124
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:43,072
"Ah! Touch it!"

125
00:06:43,106 --> 00:06:45,792
I'm just not sexy.

126
00:06:45,826 --> 00:06:47,493
Having sex with me is like having sex

127
00:06:47,527 --> 00:06:49,162
with Beavis, okay?

128
00:06:49,196 --> 00:06:50,797
It's like, "Yeah, baby, I like that!

129
00:06:50,831 --> 00:06:52,749
"Suck it! Suck it!

130
00:06:52,783 --> 00:06:55,666
"Fire. Fire. Suck it."

131
00:06:58,956 --> 00:07:00,590
Oh, you're welcome, ladies.

132
00:07:00,624 --> 00:07:03,009
You are welcome.

133
00:07:03,043 --> 00:07:06,260
This is my real voice, by the way.

134
00:07:07,297 --> 00:07:08,765
Like, people call my house,

135
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:11,267
they think I'm a woman on the phone.

136
00:07:11,301 --> 00:07:14,103
Like I need this shit.

137
00:07:14,137 --> 00:07:15,855
I had a telemarketer call me.

138
00:07:15,889 --> 00:07:16,940
I'm like, "Hello,"

139
00:07:16,974 --> 00:07:20,360
they're like, "Hi, Mrs. Myers."

140
00:07:20,394 --> 00:07:22,643
I'm like, "Dude, I have a dick."

141
00:07:23,814 --> 00:07:26,647
They're like, "That's great, Mrs. Myers."

142
00:07:29,536 --> 00:07:32,956
"We're all God's children."

143
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:35,625
I'm a recovering addict/alcoholic.

144
00:07:35,659 --> 00:07:38,292
I just had six months sober last week.

145
00:07:43,884 --> 00:07:46,133
Don't clap, it's court-ordered.

146
00:07:48,255 --> 00:07:50,640
I got busted with some
weed and I was drinking,

147
00:07:50,674 --> 00:07:52,859
so I had to go to rehab instead of jail.

148
00:07:52,893 --> 00:07:56,229
I went to this religious
rehab 'cause it was free.

149
00:07:56,263 --> 00:07:59,232
And my first A.A. meeting, it
was a Catholic A.A. meeting.

150
00:07:59,266 --> 00:08:01,567
And I swear to God at
the end of the meeting,

151
00:08:01,601 --> 00:08:03,486
this man comes out the back

152
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,872
and starts pouring all the alcoholics

153
00:08:05,906 --> 00:08:08,157
glasses of wine.

154
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:09,993
And I turn to my sponsor, Steve,

155
00:08:10,027 --> 00:08:12,662
I'm like, "Dude, what
the fuck is going on?"

156
00:08:12,696 --> 00:08:15,715
He's like, "Erik, it's cool.
Once they bless the wine,

157
00:08:15,749 --> 00:08:18,334
"we're allowed to drink it

158
00:08:18,368 --> 00:08:23,556
"because it has transformed
into the blood of Jesus."

159
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:26,759
I'm like, "No, shit!"

160
00:08:26,793 --> 00:08:29,927
"Can they bless this bag of cocaine?"

161
00:08:35,218 --> 00:08:40,021
"No, no, officer, this is
the dandruff of the Lord."

162
00:08:45,562 --> 00:08:46,446
And I'm broke.

163
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,164
I got no business going to a club

164
00:08:48,198 --> 00:08:49,198
and trying to get laid.

165
00:08:49,232 --> 00:08:51,117
I have zero money.

166
00:08:51,151 --> 00:08:53,369
And it's obvious because I can't afford

167
00:08:53,403 --> 00:08:56,372
name-brand,
top-shelf alcohol.

168
00:08:56,406 --> 00:08:57,924
I have to get some, like, piece of shit,

169
00:08:57,958 --> 00:09:00,376
generic knock-off.

170
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:01,294
I go to the bar, I'm like,

171
00:09:01,328 --> 00:09:03,296
"How much is the Sex on the Beach?"

172
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:06,099
They're like, "Ten dollars."

173
00:09:06,133 --> 00:09:08,051
I have two dollars.

174
00:09:08,085 --> 00:09:11,252
I'm like, "Give me the
Hand Job by the Creek."

175
00:09:14,591 --> 00:09:16,442
They're like, "What's in that?"

176
00:09:16,476 --> 00:09:19,896
I'm like, "Dr. Pepper,
motherfucker. Let's go.

177
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:22,513
"I can't afford ice."

178
00:09:24,935 --> 00:09:26,319
I don't smoke weed, but I do think

179
00:09:26,353 --> 00:09:29,122
weed should be legal, like everywhere.

180
00:09:29,156 --> 00:09:31,741
Yeah.

181
00:09:31,775 --> 00:09:33,826
'Cause weed is so much better than alcohol

182
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:35,912
because it's not violent.

183
00:09:35,946 --> 00:09:37,413
No one in this room has ever been

184
00:09:37,447 --> 00:09:40,166
in a fight high as shit, fucking ever.

185
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,584
Ever!

186
00:09:41,618 --> 00:09:43,920
No story's like, "I took a hit off a joint

187
00:09:43,954 --> 00:09:45,838
"and punched this guy in the fucking face."

188
00:09:45,872 --> 00:09:46,889
That never happens.

189
00:09:46,923 --> 00:09:49,308
Like, one time I ate a pot brownie.

190
00:09:49,342 --> 00:09:50,810
Some guy tried to start shit with me.

191
00:09:50,844 --> 00:09:51,928
He bumps into me, he's like,

192
00:09:51,962 --> 00:09:54,814
"Hey, watch where you're going, bitch!"

193
00:09:54,848 --> 00:09:57,600
I'm like, "Man, what'd you say?"

194
00:09:57,634 --> 00:10:00,987
"I said, watch where you're going, bitch."

195
00:10:01,021 --> 00:10:02,970
"Man, what'd you say?"

196
00:10:05,025 --> 00:10:07,193
"What, you gonna do somethin'?"

197
00:10:07,227 --> 00:10:09,310
"No, I just forgot."

198
00:10:11,481 --> 00:10:13,814
"What did you say?"

199
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:19,038
I was talking to my dad today.

200
00:10:19,072 --> 00:10:20,173
You ever talk to your parents

201
00:10:20,207 --> 00:10:23,009
and they just make you
feel like the biggest pussy?

202
00:10:23,043 --> 00:10:25,795
Like, my dad's a real
manly, intimidating guy.

203
00:10:25,829 --> 00:10:27,346
Like, everything he did growing up

204
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:30,049
was the most hardcore shit on the planet.

205
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:32,552
He's like, "Erik, you don't
know how good you had it, son.

206
00:10:32,586 --> 00:10:35,521
"When I was a kid, I had
to walk 10 miles to school

207
00:10:35,555 --> 00:10:38,307
"in the freezing snow."

208
00:10:38,341 --> 00:10:40,026
And he was raised in the 50s.

209
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:42,812
I guess that's how shit was.

210
00:10:42,846 --> 00:10:45,064
I came up in the early 90s.

211
00:10:45,098 --> 00:10:47,200
Things weren't that bad.

212
00:10:47,234 --> 00:10:48,317
I'm glad I don't have a son

213
00:10:48,351 --> 00:10:50,403
because if I bitched about my childhood,

214
00:10:50,437 --> 00:10:53,239
I'd have to make it, like,
really dramatic to sell it.

215
00:10:53,273 --> 00:10:56,826
"We didn't have cell phones in 1992!

216
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:59,996
"You ungrateful little shits!"

217
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:01,996
"I had a house phone."

218
00:11:03,283 --> 00:11:05,885
"If it rang, I had to walk ten feet

219
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:08,869
"into the fucking kitchen."

220
00:11:09,923 --> 00:11:13,926
"Across cold tiles.

221
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,728
"I didn't have Caller-ID.

222
00:11:15,762 --> 00:11:18,879
"Whoever answered, I had to
talk to those motherfuckers."

223
00:11:20,467 --> 00:11:22,852
"Oh, that's right, you little bitch."

224
00:11:22,886 --> 00:11:25,905
"I didn't have an iPod, I had a Walkman

225
00:11:25,939 --> 00:11:27,940
"with a cassette!"

226
00:11:27,974 --> 00:11:29,158
"I wanted to hear a certain song,

227
00:11:29,192 --> 00:11:31,892
"I had to fast-forward through
the whole fucking album."

228
00:11:32,946 --> 00:11:34,697
"Then the tape got stuck,
you had to take it out

229
00:11:34,731 --> 00:11:37,416
"and twist, twist, twist!"

230
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:40,953
"I didn't have iTunes and Lyric Finder.

231
00:11:40,987 --> 00:11:42,371
"If I didn't know the name of a song,

232
00:11:42,405 --> 00:11:44,257
"I had to go to Sam Goody at the mall

233
00:11:44,291 --> 00:11:46,907
"and sing that shit to the cashier."

234
00:11:50,997 --> 00:11:52,098
"That's right!

235
00:11:52,132 --> 00:11:54,383
"'Cause we were men!

236
00:11:54,417 --> 00:11:56,552
"I didn't have movies on-demand.

237
00:11:56,586 --> 00:11:59,438
"I had to rent movies from Blockbuster.

238
00:11:59,472 --> 00:12:03,007
"Shit was three days
late, it was 875 dollars."

239
00:12:05,095 --> 00:12:07,480
"I didn't have Playstation
with twelve buttons.

240
00:12:07,514 --> 00:12:09,949
"I had Nintendo... Two buttons!

241
00:12:09,983 --> 00:12:12,318
"A and B.

242
00:12:12,352 --> 00:12:16,122
"One was 'jump,' the
other was 'jump again.'

243
00:12:16,156 --> 00:12:17,605
"That's it."

244
00:12:18,692 --> 00:12:20,743
"We didn't have internet porn."

245
00:12:20,777 --> 00:12:23,663
Remember ordering porn off a hotel TV?

246
00:12:23,697 --> 00:12:24,914
I knew the front desk saw it

247
00:12:24,948 --> 00:12:26,749
and I didn't give a shit

248
00:12:26,783 --> 00:12:28,301
'cause I was so horny,

249
00:12:28,335 --> 00:12:31,637
the opening credits got me riled up.

250
00:12:31,671 --> 00:12:35,508
"The following movie contains nudity."

251
00:12:35,542 --> 00:12:37,091
"Yeah!"

252
00:12:38,428 --> 00:12:40,429
"This is the shit!

253
00:12:40,463 --> 00:12:44,684
"Adult situations. Whoo!

254
00:12:44,718 --> 00:12:48,020
"I'm an adult

255
00:12:48,054 --> 00:12:52,775
"and I wanna see some situations!"

256
00:12:52,809 --> 00:12:55,528
"Strong sexual content..."

257
00:12:55,562 --> 00:12:58,781
"Show the fucking movie!

258
00:12:58,815 --> 00:13:02,668
"Show the fucking movie!

259
00:13:02,702 --> 00:13:06,172
"Show this piece of shit!"

260
00:13:06,206 --> 00:13:09,458
"You've been charged $18.95."

261
00:13:09,492 --> 00:13:12,295
"Stop the fucking movie!"

262
00:13:12,329 --> 00:13:15,296
I'm Erik Myers. Thank you so much.

263
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:26,142
Erik Myers!

264
00:13:26,176 --> 00:13:28,644
Fuckin' hysterical.

265
00:13:28,678 --> 00:13:30,196
You see what I mean, Joey?

266
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:32,531
Things are heating up for us over here, eh?

267
00:13:32,565 --> 00:13:37,536
Fucking guy can't hear, he
can't see, he can't walk.

268
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:40,823
I like to bang 'em footless now.

269
00:13:40,857 --> 00:13:43,659
You ever bang a chick missing a limb?

270
00:13:43,693 --> 00:13:45,411
You ever do that?

271
00:13:45,445 --> 00:13:47,747
I'm telling you, it's a hot thing today.

272
00:13:47,781 --> 00:13:48,914
They even got this chick,

273
00:13:48,948 --> 00:13:50,883
if you watch the "Housewives" shows,

274
00:13:50,917 --> 00:13:53,052
the New York housewives,
they got that one chick

275
00:13:53,086 --> 00:13:55,554
that's got, like, a rubber leg.

276
00:13:55,588 --> 00:13:58,174
You know what I'm talking about?

277
00:13:58,208 --> 00:13:59,508
She's in the middle of an argument

278
00:13:59,542 --> 00:14:02,678
with one of her girlfriends,
takes off the leg

279
00:14:02,712 --> 00:14:05,546
and smashes it on the
kitchen fucking table.

280
00:14:06,716 --> 00:14:07,933
I'm going, "Would you fucking..."

281
00:14:07,967 --> 00:14:10,236
I was taught as a kid,

282
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:14,190
you don't put your elbows
on the kitchen table

283
00:14:14,224 --> 00:14:18,861
and this fucking chick's
smashing the fuckin' table

284
00:14:18,895 --> 00:14:21,364
with the fucking rubberized leg

285
00:14:21,398 --> 00:14:25,418
with the fake fuckin' foot and the sneaker.

286
00:14:25,452 --> 00:14:26,369
You think I'm kidding.

287
00:14:26,403 --> 00:14:29,372
I went to a legless women's convention.

288
00:14:29,406 --> 00:14:30,873
Listen to me, my friend.

289
00:14:30,907 --> 00:14:34,041
That was pussy crawling all over the joint.

290
00:14:38,081 --> 00:14:39,382
I know what I'm talking about.

291
00:14:39,416 --> 00:14:41,717
Get the fuck outta here.

292
00:14:41,751 --> 00:14:45,419
By the way, remind me to pinch
your tits after the show, honey.

293
00:14:46,806 --> 00:14:48,224
Anyway, coming to the stage,

294
00:14:48,258 --> 00:14:51,560
our next act, from Buffalo, New York,

295
00:14:51,594 --> 00:14:56,482
the co-host of the "D.L.
Hughley Radio Show,"

296
00:14:56,516 --> 00:14:59,483
let's give it up for Steve Wilson.

297
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:11,414
Whaddup, whaddup, whaddup?

298
00:15:11,448 --> 00:15:12,581
How y'all doin' out there?

299
00:15:12,615 --> 00:15:15,418
<i>Whoo!</i>

300
00:15:15,452 --> 00:15:17,670
Once again, I'm the only nigga here.

301
00:15:17,704 --> 00:15:19,119
This is wonderful.

302
00:15:20,623 --> 00:15:23,342
Where do y'all hide your niggas here?

303
00:15:23,376 --> 00:15:24,427
That's what I need to know.

304
00:15:24,461 --> 00:15:25,177
I see a couple in the back.

305
00:15:25,211 --> 00:15:26,095
Hi, nigga, nigga, nigga.

306
00:15:26,129 --> 00:15:29,098
How ya doin'? Good to see you.

307
00:15:29,132 --> 00:15:30,599
This is the grown portion of the show.

308
00:15:30,633 --> 00:15:32,101
Where the grown people at? Make some noise.

309
00:15:32,135 --> 00:15:33,436
Where my grown people at? Adults, clap.

310
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:34,969
Where you at?

311
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:38,157
Those are my people right there.

312
00:15:38,191 --> 00:15:39,024
We're the people that wake up

313
00:15:39,058 --> 00:15:40,276
and shit hurt for no reason.

314
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:41,494
They're my people. Where they at?

315
00:15:41,528 --> 00:15:42,661
Right there.

316
00:15:42,695 --> 00:15:45,498
I like y'all because your
bodies ain't shit, either.

317
00:15:45,532 --> 00:15:47,500
The other day, I answered my phone too fast

318
00:15:47,534 --> 00:15:48,951
and pulled a pec muscle.

319
00:15:48,985 --> 00:15:51,003
That's what your body...

320
00:15:51,037 --> 00:15:52,338
"Whaddup, pimp? Hold on, nigga,

321
00:15:52,372 --> 00:15:55,291
"this ain't right.

322
00:15:55,325 --> 00:15:57,510
"I'm gonna need you to text me."

323
00:15:57,544 --> 00:15:58,511
My body fallin' apart.

324
00:15:58,545 --> 00:16:00,012
I'm not gonna lie to you. Nine months ago,

325
00:16:00,046 --> 00:16:01,630
I had kidney stones.

326
00:16:01,664 --> 00:16:04,049
Worst pain in the world.

327
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:05,468
I don't wish it on my worst enemy.

328
00:16:05,502 --> 00:16:06,469
For those of you that have never had it,

329
00:16:06,503 --> 00:16:08,220
it is worse than child-birth.

330
00:16:08,254 --> 00:16:09,722
This is the worse pain...

331
00:16:09,756 --> 00:16:11,640
See, no matter what city you go to,

332
00:16:11,674 --> 00:16:14,143
there's always a woman, "How do you
know it's worse than child-birth?"

333
00:16:14,177 --> 00:16:15,027
You hear them?

334
00:16:15,061 --> 00:16:16,028
You wanna know how I know it's worse?

335
00:16:16,062 --> 00:16:17,696
Because a rock came out my dick.

336
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:19,513
Bitch, I won.

337
00:16:23,236 --> 00:16:24,954
The pain is worse. Fuck your baby.

338
00:16:24,988 --> 00:16:26,520
Let me tell you something...

339
00:16:28,608 --> 00:16:30,709
the pain was so bad, I'm going in and out

340
00:16:30,743 --> 00:16:31,877
of consciousness.

341
00:16:31,911 --> 00:16:32,912
Here's what I hate:

342
00:16:32,946 --> 00:16:34,914
The paramedics just go assume

343
00:16:34,948 --> 00:16:36,882
and rush me to the hospital in the hood,

344
00:16:36,916 --> 00:16:38,551
like, "He'll feel safer there."

345
00:16:38,585 --> 00:16:39,752
I'm like, "No.

346
00:16:39,786 --> 00:16:41,837
"I got insurance. I
don't know these niggas."

347
00:16:41,871 --> 00:16:43,339
Let me tell you something.

348
00:16:43,373 --> 00:16:45,891
I don't feel safe with
a doctor, pants sagging.

349
00:16:45,925 --> 00:16:47,092
This motherfucker had gold teeth.

350
00:16:47,126 --> 00:16:49,011
He came over to my bed like,

351
00:16:49,045 --> 00:16:50,513
"Yo, you a'ight?"

352
00:16:50,547 --> 00:16:53,516
I was like, "Hell, no, I ain't all right."

353
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:56,902
"Motherfucker, I got Obamacare, my man."

354
00:16:56,936 --> 00:17:00,856
"I need to see Dr. McDreamy and the chief."

355
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:02,074
"And the little mean Asian bitch

356
00:17:02,108 --> 00:17:04,274
"or Dr. House or something, motherfucker."

357
00:17:06,479 --> 00:17:08,080
I don't trust hospitals. You know why?

358
00:17:08,114 --> 00:17:10,032
Because I watch the TV show "House."

359
00:17:10,066 --> 00:17:11,417
And you see, they practice medicine.

360
00:17:11,451 --> 00:17:14,234
It's not an exact science.
They wing that shit.

361
00:17:15,288 --> 00:17:16,422
You ever watch House? It's like, "Dr. House

362
00:17:16,456 --> 00:17:17,373
"there's something wrong with my elbow."

363
00:17:17,407 --> 00:17:19,740
House'll be like, "Cut his dick off."

364
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:24,630
And I don't trust no doctor

365
00:17:24,664 --> 00:17:27,383
that can cure cancer, but
can't fix his own shit.

366
00:17:27,417 --> 00:17:28,217
This motherfucker just show up every week,

367
00:17:28,251 --> 00:17:29,750
just...

368
00:17:35,758 --> 00:17:37,393
He'll walk right over
to your bed and be like,

369
00:17:37,427 --> 00:17:38,227
"What's your symptoms?"

370
00:17:38,261 --> 00:17:39,812
I'll be like, "Fix your shit first.

371
00:17:39,846 --> 00:17:42,346
"That's what the fuck my symptoms are."

372
00:17:43,816 --> 00:17:44,783
So then my doctors say,

373
00:17:44,817 --> 00:17:45,734
"Hey, man, you're getting a little older.

374
00:17:45,768 --> 00:17:47,736
"We wanna check your prostate."

375
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:50,406
And I said, "No...

376
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,072
"I'll pray on it."

377
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:54,827
"You ain't' gotta go in there.

378
00:17:54,861 --> 00:17:57,880
"That's between me and Jesus, you know?"

379
00:17:57,914 --> 00:17:59,748
But then they scare you
with all these statistics.

380
00:17:59,782 --> 00:18:01,417
Like, "in the African-American community,

381
00:18:01,451 --> 00:18:03,502
"prostate cancer numbers are rising."

382
00:18:03,536 --> 00:18:06,005
I was like, "Well..."

383
00:18:06,039 --> 00:18:07,006
So, I called my mother. She said,

384
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,090
"Baby, you smarter than that.

385
00:18:08,124 --> 00:18:09,808
"You let that man check
you just for your health.

386
00:18:09,842 --> 00:18:11,143
"I raised you better than that."

387
00:18:11,177 --> 00:18:12,595
I was like, "Well..."

388
00:18:12,629 --> 00:18:13,429
So, I made an appointment.

389
00:18:13,463 --> 00:18:14,346
Here's what I hate:

390
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:15,598
After you give them your permission,

391
00:18:15,632 --> 00:18:17,683
they ain't sensitive to your needs no more.

392
00:18:17,717 --> 00:18:19,485
He was all aggressive, like,

393
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:21,687
"Take your pants off and bend over."

394
00:18:21,721 --> 00:18:22,605
I said, "Hold on, motherfucker.

395
00:18:22,639 --> 00:18:24,021
"This is my first time."

396
00:18:25,308 --> 00:18:27,443
"Can we grind or kiss first or something?

397
00:18:27,477 --> 00:18:29,778
"I ain't easy."

398
00:18:29,812 --> 00:18:32,448
You ever get your prostate
checked, young man?

399
00:18:32,482 --> 00:18:33,949
- How old are you?
- Thirty-one.

400
00:18:33,983 --> 00:18:35,117
Thirty-one.

401
00:18:35,151 --> 00:18:35,868
Nine years from now, somebody
gonna finger-fuck you.

402
00:18:35,902 --> 00:18:37,201
How you feel about that?

403
00:18:40,823 --> 00:18:42,041
It's for your health, motherfucker,

404
00:18:42,075 --> 00:18:45,044
but it's going down. I
want you to know that.

405
00:18:45,078 --> 00:18:45,928
But check this out,

406
00:18:45,962 --> 00:18:47,212
I don't wanna scare you, brother,

407
00:18:47,246 --> 00:18:48,847
but this how it goes down:

408
00:18:48,881 --> 00:18:51,350
First of all, it was me and a man.

409
00:18:51,384 --> 00:18:52,833
We was in a room alone.

410
00:18:54,504 --> 00:18:55,804
It was dark outside, it was raining.

411
00:18:55,838 --> 00:18:57,304
That's how I remember it.

412
00:18:58,725 --> 00:19:03,479
I had my pants at my ankles,
and I bent over a table.

413
00:19:03,513 --> 00:19:05,846
This motherfucker took his rubber glove...

414
00:19:07,233 --> 00:19:09,818
took some lube...

415
00:19:09,852 --> 00:19:12,821
took his finger...

416
00:19:12,855 --> 00:19:14,404
right in my booty hole.

417
00:19:19,245 --> 00:19:21,195
I don't think you motherfuckers heard me.

418
00:19:22,699 --> 00:19:26,001
A <i>man</i> took his finger

419
00:19:26,035 --> 00:19:28,504
right in my booty hole.

420
00:19:28,538 --> 00:19:30,339
First of all, I know me.

421
00:19:30,373 --> 00:19:31,724
There should have been more resistance.

422
00:19:31,758 --> 00:19:33,090
You know what I'm saying?

423
00:19:36,713 --> 00:19:38,847
Now, I'm bent over the
table judging myself, like,

424
00:19:38,881 --> 00:19:41,183
"What the fuck you been doin'

425
00:19:41,217 --> 00:19:44,319
"that his finger just
went right in your ass?

426
00:19:44,353 --> 00:19:46,438
"When he leave the room,
we gonna talk to us."

427
00:19:46,472 --> 00:19:48,607
Then I was more concerned thinking,

428
00:19:48,641 --> 00:19:50,025
what is the doctor back there thinking?

429
00:19:50,059 --> 00:19:52,726
Like, "It went right in,
you know what I mean?"

430
00:19:55,064 --> 00:19:58,250
"He trying to act like... Whatever.

431
00:19:58,284 --> 00:19:59,368
"I could've gotten two fingers.

432
00:19:59,402 --> 00:20:01,704
"He bullshittin'. You know what I mean?"

433
00:20:01,738 --> 00:20:04,707
"Don't ask, don't tell."

434
00:20:04,741 --> 00:20:06,425
And that's why I don't trust hospitals.

435
00:20:06,459 --> 00:20:08,093
All of the medical advances they got

436
00:20:08,127 --> 00:20:09,628
and advances in science,

437
00:20:09,662 --> 00:20:11,463
and the only way you can check my prostate

438
00:20:11,497 --> 00:20:14,550
is with your finger? Come on.

439
00:20:14,584 --> 00:20:18,085
You can't take a iPad and just
brush it up against my ass?

440
00:20:22,141 --> 00:20:24,109
They gotta have a app by now.

441
00:20:24,143 --> 00:20:25,894
You know what I mean? Come on.

442
00:20:25,928 --> 00:20:27,112
Motherfucker, you got Google Earth.

443
00:20:27,146 --> 00:20:29,231
You can see my license
plate from outer space,

444
00:20:29,265 --> 00:20:31,066
but you gotta finger-fuck me?

445
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:33,619
No, fix that.

446
00:20:33,653 --> 00:20:35,569
I got Obamacare, fix it.

447
00:20:41,444 --> 00:20:42,911
Now, I ain't gonna lie to you, brother.

448
00:20:42,945 --> 00:20:45,247
The first time you go, it's horrific.

449
00:20:45,281 --> 00:20:46,632
Not gonna lie.

450
00:20:46,666 --> 00:20:47,800
You sit there and you
feel all dirty, you know?

451
00:20:47,834 --> 00:20:49,835
He left out of the room, I was like,

452
00:20:49,869 --> 00:20:51,501
"Can I get a glass of water?"

453
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,974
Second time you go,

454
00:20:56,008 --> 00:20:58,125
it ain't that bad, you know what I mean?

455
00:21:00,129 --> 00:21:01,513
Me and the doctor was talking.

456
00:21:01,547 --> 00:21:02,796
I was like, "Whatcha think the
Lakers are gonna do this year?"

457
00:21:04,133 --> 00:21:04,983
"Get in there, motherfucker.

458
00:21:05,017 --> 00:21:06,433
"I got Obamacare."

459
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,107
Back out there dating again.

460
00:21:12,141 --> 00:21:14,943
It's tough dating because I'm damaged.

461
00:21:14,977 --> 00:21:15,828
But I will tell you this,

462
00:21:15,862 --> 00:21:16,945
I don't care what your ethnicity,

463
00:21:16,979 --> 00:21:18,947
if you are a good woman, we can date.

464
00:21:18,981 --> 00:21:20,616
I don't think, like, that you
you gotta be a certain race.

465
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:21,583
That's dumb.

466
00:21:21,617 --> 00:21:23,168
This is the United States of America.

467
00:21:23,202 --> 00:21:24,620
You should be with whoever
the fuck make you happy.

468
00:21:24,654 --> 00:21:26,320
You know what I mean?

469
00:21:28,741 --> 00:21:29,842
Twenty people clapped.

470
00:21:29,876 --> 00:21:31,992
The rest of you racist motherfuckers, what?

471
00:21:33,162 --> 00:21:34,797
"Take that shit back to L.A., motherfucker.

472
00:21:34,831 --> 00:21:35,547
"We don't do this here

473
00:21:35,581 --> 00:21:37,297
"down by the water and shit."

474
00:21:38,417 --> 00:21:40,135
I'm gonna tell you right now,

475
00:21:40,169 --> 00:21:41,970
one of the sexiest women
I ever dated in my life

476
00:21:42,004 --> 00:21:43,972
was a woman from Iran.

477
00:21:44,006 --> 00:21:46,308
Middle-Eastern women are gorgeous.

478
00:21:46,342 --> 00:21:47,192
<i>Whoo!</i>

479
00:21:47,226 --> 00:21:48,310
Oh, yeah, and it was extra sexy, too,

480
00:21:48,344 --> 00:21:50,344
because I felt like I
was betraying our country.

481
00:21:55,067 --> 00:21:56,201
Every time we fucked,

482
00:21:56,235 --> 00:21:57,536
I'd just whisper military
secrets in her ear, like,

483
00:21:57,570 --> 00:21:59,154
"You know we attack at noon."

484
00:21:59,188 --> 00:22:00,239
She'd be like, "What?"

485
00:22:00,273 --> 00:22:02,239
"Shhh."

486
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:06,159
"Just tell your father
to get the note to ISIS."

487
00:22:08,197 --> 00:22:10,197
Oh, fuck y'all. Let it go.

488
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:15,921
Also, I love Latinas.

489
00:22:15,955 --> 00:22:17,704
We got any Latinas in the house?

490
00:22:18,758 --> 00:22:19,925
Oh, I love them.

491
00:22:19,959 --> 00:22:21,927
You just gotta watch them
because they're aggressive.

492
00:22:21,961 --> 00:22:23,011
I was dating this Mexican chick

493
00:22:23,045 --> 00:22:24,062
and she'd suck on my titties

494
00:22:24,096 --> 00:22:25,762
and I don't appreciate that shit.

495
00:22:30,102 --> 00:22:32,070
First of all, I'm going to the gym now.

496
00:22:32,104 --> 00:22:34,221
These is pecs. Don't disrespect me.

497
00:22:35,892 --> 00:22:37,359
She's biting on my nipples all hard.

498
00:22:37,393 --> 00:22:40,112
My nipples are sore for two days.

499
00:22:40,146 --> 00:22:42,281
Got me walking around
like I'm on my period.

500
00:22:42,315 --> 00:22:44,064
Like, just leave me alone.

501
00:22:48,237 --> 00:22:51,256
I don't feel like being with nobody.

502
00:22:51,290 --> 00:22:52,708
I'm gonna read <i>Fifty Shades of Grey</i>

503
00:22:52,742 --> 00:22:54,543
and watch "Scandalous,"
some bullshit like that.

504
00:22:54,577 --> 00:22:56,929
I don't know.

505
00:22:56,963 --> 00:22:59,381
I love white girls, too.

506
00:22:59,415 --> 00:23:01,049
Only thing about white folk is

507
00:23:01,083 --> 00:23:03,719
y'all a little freakier than us.

508
00:23:03,753 --> 00:23:05,053
I was dating this one white girl.

509
00:23:05,087 --> 00:23:06,939
She liked to role-play and experiment

510
00:23:06,973 --> 00:23:08,724
and she tried to bring
the devil in the bedroom.

511
00:23:08,758 --> 00:23:09,892
You know what I'm saying?

512
00:23:09,926 --> 00:23:11,393
And black folk, we don't
fuck with the devil like that.

513
00:23:11,427 --> 00:23:12,976
You know what I mean?

514
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,731
Ask the black dudes in the back.

515
00:23:15,765 --> 00:23:17,950
We don't fuck with the
devil like that, do we?

516
00:23:17,984 --> 00:23:21,119
She says, you know, she was a witch.

517
00:23:21,153 --> 00:23:23,655
I came in the bedroom, she
was already naked, like,

518
00:23:23,689 --> 00:23:25,322
"Neh..."

519
00:23:28,527 --> 00:23:30,327
"Fuck me."

520
00:23:31,831 --> 00:23:32,581
I was like,

521
00:23:32,615 --> 00:23:34,281
"Can I speak to Kimmy?"

522
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:40,589
She was like, "Kimmy not here."

523
00:23:40,623 --> 00:23:44,142
I was like, "Well, both
you bitches gotta go because

524
00:23:44,176 --> 00:23:45,093
"don't get me wrong, I'm a freak,

525
00:23:45,127 --> 00:23:47,562
"but I love Jesus.

526
00:23:47,596 --> 00:23:48,814
"I ain't going to hell for no pussy.

527
00:23:48,848 --> 00:23:51,298
"He died for my sins,
you just got big titties."

528
00:23:58,691 --> 00:23:59,491
Like I said, I'm single.

529
00:23:59,525 --> 00:24:01,308
I'm looking for a good woman.

530
00:24:02,528 --> 00:24:04,394
Why you all laughing?

531
00:24:05,698 --> 00:24:07,449
I'm trying to find somebody
that's not damaged like me.

532
00:24:07,483 --> 00:24:08,784
You know?

533
00:24:08,818 --> 00:24:10,869
Somebody who a freak.

534
00:24:10,903 --> 00:24:12,371
We got any freaks in the
house? Make some noise.

535
00:24:12,405 --> 00:24:14,122
Any freaks?

536
00:24:14,156 --> 00:24:15,007
Not you.

537
00:24:15,041 --> 00:24:16,490
What the fuck a dude clapping for?

538
00:24:19,996 --> 00:24:22,514
I don't swing that way, brother.

539
00:24:22,548 --> 00:24:24,967
Not that there's anything
wrong with it, but, you know.

540
00:24:25,001 --> 00:24:27,135
I said, "Any freaks?"
and the dude's, "Whoo!"

541
00:24:27,169 --> 00:24:28,804
No, nigga, I don't get on like that.

542
00:24:28,838 --> 00:24:31,139
Anyway, but listen,

543
00:24:31,173 --> 00:24:34,810
I'm a freak, but my
freakism is up here, ladies.

544
00:24:34,844 --> 00:24:35,978
You gotta be able to roll with me because

545
00:24:36,012 --> 00:24:37,479
I'm a freak, freak, freak, freak.

546
00:24:37,513 --> 00:24:39,815
Like, young lady, you ever have somebody

547
00:24:39,849 --> 00:24:42,065
drink some Hennessy out your butt?

548
00:24:51,027 --> 00:24:52,526
No?

549
00:24:53,863 --> 00:24:56,331
<i>Try it tonight!</i>

550
00:24:56,365 --> 00:24:57,499
See, the first time I do it,

551
00:24:57,533 --> 00:24:59,334
you gonna be shocked, like, "Oh, my God.

552
00:24:59,368 --> 00:25:01,336
"What are you doing?"

553
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:02,220
The second time, you'll be like,

554
00:25:02,254 --> 00:25:05,340
"Pour slow, nigga, pour slow."

555
00:25:05,374 --> 00:25:06,391
Thank you very much, Santa Barbara.

556
00:25:06,425 --> 00:25:07,841
I'm outta here.

557
00:25:23,476 --> 00:25:24,359
Steve Wilson.

558
00:25:24,393 --> 00:25:26,059
Let's hear it for him again.

559
00:25:29,732 --> 00:25:31,083
You know, it would be wrong

560
00:25:31,117 --> 00:25:33,585
if I didn't say, just for a minute,

561
00:25:33,619 --> 00:25:36,705
that we've recently lost one of our

562
00:25:36,739 --> 00:25:38,874
greatest female comics,

563
00:25:38,908 --> 00:25:43,428
probably our greatest female comic ever,

564
00:25:43,462 --> 00:25:45,764
Joan Rivers, who, for decades,

565
00:25:45,798 --> 00:25:48,415
entertained this world.

566
00:25:50,586 --> 00:25:53,722
And let's just give it up for her,

567
00:25:53,756 --> 00:25:57,943
who persevered and gave everything she had.

568
00:25:57,977 --> 00:26:01,229
And the reason I bring that up

569
00:26:01,263 --> 00:26:03,698
is because we've all been inspired

570
00:26:03,732 --> 00:26:07,402
and when I was asked to do the show,

571
00:26:07,436 --> 00:26:09,654
they said, "We want a female comic.

572
00:26:09,688 --> 00:26:11,239
"We need somebody great."

573
00:26:11,273 --> 00:26:14,076
And I couldn't think of anybody because

574
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:18,080
this girl that I'm gonna
bring on now has been...

575
00:26:18,114 --> 00:26:20,582
She has put twenty years of comedy

576
00:26:20,616 --> 00:26:23,502
into the last five years,
building her career.

577
00:26:23,536 --> 00:26:25,554
She is from South Philly.

578
00:26:25,588 --> 00:26:27,005
I would have to say,

579
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:29,424
she is the funniest female comic

580
00:26:29,458 --> 00:26:31,927
in the country working today.

581
00:26:31,961 --> 00:26:35,764
Let's give it up for Eleanor Kerrigan.

582
00:26:35,798 --> 00:26:37,797
Take it, Eleanor.

583
00:26:47,526 --> 00:26:48,193
Yeah!

584
00:26:48,227 --> 00:26:49,277
Wow.

585
00:26:49,311 --> 00:26:52,114
Look at this sausage fest right here.

586
00:26:52,148 --> 00:26:53,697
What's up?

587
00:26:54,817 --> 00:26:57,786
It's like the meat-packing
district right there.

588
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:59,788
A couple of queers in the front.

589
00:26:59,822 --> 00:27:01,321
I love it.

590
00:27:02,491 --> 00:27:03,341
I love queers.

591
00:27:03,375 --> 00:27:05,460
How are you, sir? Can you hear me?

592
00:27:05,494 --> 00:27:07,796
Can you hear me?

593
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:09,014
Not a fuckin' thing.

594
00:27:09,048 --> 00:27:10,215
Guys, give it up for Milton Berle.

595
00:27:10,249 --> 00:27:11,831
He's here tonight.

596
00:27:15,171 --> 00:27:17,389
How are you guys? I'm
so excited to be here.

597
00:27:17,423 --> 00:27:18,640
Give it up for Dice, man.

598
00:27:18,674 --> 00:27:20,692
Doing this, this is insane.

599
00:27:20,726 --> 00:27:22,644
I'm very excited. I am very excited.

600
00:27:22,678 --> 00:27:26,148
I'm an East-Coaster. Do
we have any East-Coasters?

601
00:27:26,182 --> 00:27:27,399
Wow.

602
00:27:27,433 --> 00:27:29,901
The loudest fuckers on
the planet, aren't we?

603
00:27:29,935 --> 00:27:31,069
I fuckin' love it.

604
00:27:31,103 --> 00:27:32,320
That's just sayin' "hi," this.

605
00:27:32,354 --> 00:27:36,324
I just came a little
from that, you dirty fuck.

606
00:27:36,358 --> 00:27:37,576
Don't start with me.

607
00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:39,377
I'll come down there, I'll
rape the shit out of you.

608
00:27:39,411 --> 00:27:40,745
I got a 4-inch clitoris.

609
00:27:40,779 --> 00:27:44,080
I will fuck you up, jack.

610
00:27:46,252 --> 00:27:49,387
I'm sorry, did my balls drop out?

611
00:27:49,421 --> 00:27:51,173
He's adorable.

612
00:27:51,207 --> 00:27:52,591
I am an East-Coaster. I love it.

613
00:27:52,625 --> 00:27:54,176
I was just home two weeks ago.

614
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:55,393
I'm there for five... There is not one

615
00:27:55,427 --> 00:27:57,095
unexpressed thought running
around the East Coast.

616
00:27:57,129 --> 00:27:58,263
They say whatever they feel.

617
00:27:58,297 --> 00:27:59,848
Like, I'm from South Philly.

618
00:27:59,882 --> 00:28:01,349
As soon as I land, this is what I hear,

619
00:28:01,383 --> 00:28:04,269
"I'm gonna put my foot so far up your ass."

620
00:28:04,303 --> 00:28:09,441
I'm like, "Jesus Christ,
Dad, let me get my bag. Shit."

621
00:28:09,475 --> 00:28:10,692
Like, they get right in your face.

622
00:28:10,726 --> 00:28:12,410
Riding to my mother's
house, I'm all excited.

623
00:28:12,444 --> 00:28:13,995
I see my sister Karen, I'm like,

624
00:28:14,029 --> 00:28:15,197
"Yo, Kar, where's Mommy?"

625
00:28:15,231 --> 00:28:17,781
She's like, "She's up my ass.
You wanna tickle her feet?"

626
00:28:19,902 --> 00:28:23,255
"No, bitch, I just wanted
to say 'happy birthday.'

627
00:28:23,289 --> 00:28:25,457
"What kind of party are you guys having?"

628
00:28:25,491 --> 00:28:26,708
They get wild over there.

629
00:28:26,742 --> 00:28:28,710
But now it's weird
because I live in L.A. now.

630
00:28:28,744 --> 00:28:29,761
I moved to L.A.

631
00:28:29,795 --> 00:28:32,964
Do we have any L.A. people? A couple?

632
00:28:32,998 --> 00:28:35,467
Don't get too excited, fuckers.

633
00:28:35,501 --> 00:28:37,552
They got weird shit in L.A.

634
00:28:37,586 --> 00:28:38,470
You gotta admit that.

635
00:28:38,504 --> 00:28:40,972
They got vegans out there.

636
00:28:41,006 --> 00:28:42,891
Do we have any vegans in here?

637
00:28:42,925 --> 00:28:43,942
I'd ask you to raise your hand,

638
00:28:43,976 --> 00:28:46,061
but I'm sure you don't
have the fucking strength.

639
00:28:46,095 --> 00:28:48,094
I'm positive.

640
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,485
Holy shit, have you seen these people?

641
00:28:53,519 --> 00:28:56,269
They're just, "Oh, I feel so healthy."

642
00:28:57,773 --> 00:28:59,658
"I feel terrific.

643
00:28:59,692 --> 00:29:03,245
"All I eat is kale.

644
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:05,163
"I feel so healthy, I've been peeing

645
00:29:05,197 --> 00:29:08,083
"out of my ass for a month."

646
00:29:08,117 --> 00:29:10,669
Oh, shit, bitch, suck a dick.

647
00:29:10,703 --> 00:29:13,670
Eat a steak, get some protein.

648
00:29:16,792 --> 00:29:19,761
Get some real protein in there, man.

649
00:29:19,795 --> 00:29:21,646
And they have their own
gang, too, in Whole Foods.

650
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,096
Have you seen them?

651
00:29:25,467 --> 00:29:26,935
I thought they were
re-casting that TV show.

652
00:29:26,969 --> 00:29:28,968
"The Walking Dead."

653
00:29:30,723 --> 00:29:33,890
They were all in there
just motoring around.

654
00:29:35,194 --> 00:29:36,528
I saw one lady, I'm like,

655
00:29:36,562 --> 00:29:38,163
"Oh, shit, she's been dead for a month.

656
00:29:38,197 --> 00:29:40,532
"She's gonna get the part easily."

657
00:29:40,566 --> 00:29:42,450
And it's so healthy in there, right?

658
00:29:42,484 --> 00:29:43,535
Makes you feel uncomfortable.

659
00:29:43,569 --> 00:29:45,003
It's healthy, too healthy,

660
00:29:45,037 --> 00:29:46,288
and way too expensive.

661
00:29:46,322 --> 00:29:47,756
I'm not really a health nut.

662
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:49,457
Like, I work out 'cause I have anger issues

663
00:29:49,491 --> 00:29:51,126
and I may or may not snap his fuckin' neck.

664
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,011
You know what I mean?

665
00:29:53,045 --> 00:29:54,379
That's just how I am, right?

666
00:29:54,413 --> 00:29:56,214
But, like, I'm not healthy.

667
00:29:56,248 --> 00:29:57,382
Like, tonight for dinner,

668
00:29:57,416 --> 00:29:59,384
I had Swedish Fish and a bump of cocaine.

669
00:29:59,418 --> 00:30:00,834
You know what I mean?

670
00:30:03,172 --> 00:30:05,523
'Cause it's a long drive from L.A.

671
00:30:05,557 --> 00:30:07,058
You gotta be fucking wired.

672
00:30:07,092 --> 00:30:08,810
That's how you do it, right?

673
00:30:08,844 --> 00:30:10,145
So, I'm walking around in Whole Foods,

674
00:30:10,179 --> 00:30:11,696
I'm like, "What the hell am I gonna eat?"

675
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:12,864
I saw they had pizza.

676
00:30:12,898 --> 00:30:14,482
I go, "Oh, I'll get a slice of pizza."

677
00:30:14,516 --> 00:30:16,901
Right? You can't fuck up pizza.

678
00:30:16,935 --> 00:30:18,234
Yeah, you can.

679
00:30:19,688 --> 00:30:22,490
Thirty-eight dollars for a slice of pizza.

680
00:30:22,524 --> 00:30:23,875
I'm from South Philly.

681
00:30:23,909 --> 00:30:26,211
A slice of pizza is $1.50.

682
00:30:26,245 --> 00:30:27,912
A dollar if you let the little Italian guy

683
00:30:27,946 --> 00:30:29,214
finger you behind the counter.

684
00:30:29,248 --> 00:30:31,049
You understand what I'm saying?

685
00:30:31,083 --> 00:30:34,669
And I let him do it.

686
00:30:34,703 --> 00:30:37,088
'Cause that's good pizza.

687
00:30:37,122 --> 00:30:39,007
I'll take his doughy little finger

688
00:30:39,041 --> 00:30:42,060
for a 50-cent discount.

689
00:30:42,094 --> 00:30:43,345
I'll get a yeast infection.

690
00:30:43,379 --> 00:30:45,011
That's good bread.

691
00:30:47,599 --> 00:30:48,733
But 38 dollars?

692
00:30:48,767 --> 00:30:51,186
I'm like, "Oh, my God,
this must be magical pizza.

693
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:52,187
"Let me try this pizza."

694
00:30:52,221 --> 00:30:53,405
The guy sold it to me, too.

695
00:30:53,439 --> 00:30:54,522
He's like, "Oh, you're gonna love it.

696
00:30:54,556 --> 00:30:57,025
"It's gluten-free,
it's ion-free."

697
00:30:57,059 --> 00:30:59,077
What the fuck is an ion?

698
00:30:59,111 --> 00:31:00,578
"It's lactose-free."

699
00:31:00,612 --> 00:31:03,029
I ate it, it shoulda been free.

700
00:31:04,233 --> 00:31:05,116
It tastes like a foot.

701
00:31:05,150 --> 00:31:06,084
I was like, "What?"

702
00:31:06,118 --> 00:31:08,586
It was like cardboard with, like, ketchup

703
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:10,620
and, like, a cow pissed on it.

704
00:31:11,907 --> 00:31:13,875
I'm like, "Hey, dude, that's not cheese.

705
00:31:13,909 --> 00:31:16,878
"You gotta rub that cow out the right way.

706
00:31:16,912 --> 00:31:18,380
"Like, really get in there.

707
00:31:18,414 --> 00:31:19,464
"Put your finger in his ass.

708
00:31:19,498 --> 00:31:21,381
"Really help him out."

709
00:31:23,669 --> 00:31:24,386
It was disgusting.

710
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:25,303
And I'm, like, eating it.

711
00:31:25,337 --> 00:31:27,055
I'm like, "Oh, my God, this is so bad,"

712
00:31:27,089 --> 00:31:29,774
and as I'm eating it, trying
not to throw up on myself,

713
00:31:29,808 --> 00:31:31,393
here comes one of the vegan ladies.

714
00:31:31,427 --> 00:31:33,760
She's like, "Oh, isn't it terrific?"

715
00:31:35,681 --> 00:31:36,781
"Don't you just love it?"

716
00:31:36,815 --> 00:31:39,766
I'm like, "Oh, shit, your
hip just broke. Fuck."

717
00:31:43,272 --> 00:31:47,492
I had to put this bitch
back together in aisle 8.

718
00:31:47,526 --> 00:31:49,577
They have a whole aisle
in there dedicated to

719
00:31:49,611 --> 00:31:50,912
your food allergies.

720
00:31:50,946 --> 00:31:53,581
Who grew up with food allergies, right?

721
00:31:53,615 --> 00:31:57,669
Not unless you had money did
you know you had food allergies.

722
00:31:57,703 --> 00:31:59,971
That's bullshit. Food allergies.

723
00:32:00,005 --> 00:32:00,922
I'm a hood rat.

724
00:32:00,956 --> 00:32:03,289
I got nine brothers and sister. Anybody?

725
00:32:04,343 --> 00:32:06,509
Oh, a couple Mexicans are here. Good.

726
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:10,098
You Mexicans, man.

727
00:32:10,132 --> 00:32:13,184
My mom had ten kids. That's insane.

728
00:32:13,218 --> 00:32:14,602
Her uterus was like a clown car,

729
00:32:14,636 --> 00:32:16,988
you understand?

730
00:32:17,022 --> 00:32:20,024
I was number 8. I walked out.

731
00:32:20,058 --> 00:32:21,993
I was pulling on the cord, I'm like,

732
00:32:22,027 --> 00:32:23,278
"What do you want me to do with this?"

733
00:32:23,312 --> 00:32:26,029
She's like, "You need to cut
that shit and get a job, bitch."

734
00:32:27,816 --> 00:32:29,617
"We got bills to pay.

735
00:32:29,651 --> 00:32:32,370
"And I'm pregnant again. Hurry
up, get the fuck out of here.

736
00:32:32,404 --> 00:32:34,873
"Get out."

737
00:32:34,907 --> 00:32:35,840
She didn't mess around.

738
00:32:35,874 --> 00:32:37,342
I don't know how she did it with ten kids.

739
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:38,626
I'll never understand that.

740
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:40,128
I remember I used to run in the kitchen.

741
00:32:40,162 --> 00:32:41,713
I'd be like, "Hey, Ma,
can I get some Kool-Aid?"

742
00:32:41,747 --> 00:32:43,014
And she'd turn around and go,

743
00:32:43,048 --> 00:32:45,832
"Why don't you stick a broom
up my ass and I'll sweep?"

744
00:32:47,503 --> 00:32:49,854
"Look, lady, I don't know
what the fuck you're into

745
00:32:49,888 --> 00:32:51,639
"late at night,

746
00:32:51,673 --> 00:32:54,192
"but maybe if you would've
swallowed once in a while,

747
00:32:54,226 --> 00:32:56,342
"it wouldn't be so crowded in here."

748
00:32:59,848 --> 00:33:01,397
Right?

749
00:33:02,851 --> 00:33:03,651
She got nervous.

750
00:33:03,685 --> 00:33:04,819
Don't worry, I'm only kidding.

751
00:33:04,853 --> 00:33:06,986
Relax, my mom swallows.

752
00:33:08,574 --> 00:33:13,211
Who do you think taught me, right?

753
00:33:13,245 --> 00:33:14,712
Food allergies?

754
00:33:14,746 --> 00:33:16,130
We didn't have food allergies, man.

755
00:33:16,164 --> 00:33:17,499
If we ate something that made us sick,

756
00:33:17,533 --> 00:33:19,417
we just didn't fuckin' eat that no more.

757
00:33:19,451 --> 00:33:21,002
That was it.

758
00:33:21,036 --> 00:33:23,671
We didn't get, like, a trip to the doctor,

759
00:33:23,705 --> 00:33:25,173
or a shot or a helmet

760
00:33:25,207 --> 00:33:27,540
or whatever these fucking idiots need.

761
00:33:29,761 --> 00:33:31,513
Let me tell you something,
today as a parent,

762
00:33:31,547 --> 00:33:32,730
as a parent,

763
00:33:32,764 --> 00:33:35,264
you could send peanut butter
to school and kill somebody.

764
00:33:36,385 --> 00:33:38,019
What the fuck is that?

765
00:33:38,053 --> 00:33:39,604
Like, what is happening to the world?

766
00:33:39,638 --> 00:33:41,239
Let me tell you, if I sent
peanut butter to school,

767
00:33:41,273 --> 00:33:43,525
not that I'd ever carry
a kid to full-term,

768
00:33:43,559 --> 00:33:45,058
but if I...

769
00:33:50,732 --> 00:33:52,250
A couple whores. Yeah, I like it.

770
00:33:52,284 --> 00:33:53,034
I feel ya.

771
00:33:53,068 --> 00:33:54,085
Seriously, I'm old school.

772
00:33:54,119 --> 00:33:55,036
If I even think I'm pregnant,

773
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:57,403
I'll throw myself down a flight of steps.

774
00:34:00,459 --> 00:34:02,961
I got a punch-card at Planned Parenthood.

775
00:34:02,995 --> 00:34:04,877
I am not fucking around.

776
00:34:06,582 --> 00:34:09,217
We will get rid of this shit.

777
00:34:09,251 --> 00:34:11,219
But if I sent peanut butter to school

778
00:34:11,253 --> 00:34:12,554
and a fucking little kid died,

779
00:34:12,588 --> 00:34:15,557
you let that fucking kid go.

780
00:34:15,591 --> 00:34:17,757
That's a weak kid.

781
00:34:19,761 --> 00:34:22,280
Right?

782
00:34:22,314 --> 00:34:23,898
We gotta thin the herd, man.

783
00:34:23,932 --> 00:34:25,400
What if we get invaded by another country?

784
00:34:25,434 --> 00:34:26,651
They're not even gonna bring weapons.

785
00:34:26,685 --> 00:34:29,235
They're gonna bring the
Planter's Peanuts guy.

786
00:34:33,525 --> 00:34:35,493
It all stems 'cause you
can't hit kids anymore.

787
00:34:35,527 --> 00:34:36,744
Did you know that? You can't hit kids.

788
00:34:36,778 --> 00:34:38,079
It's fucking illegal.

789
00:34:38,113 --> 00:34:39,464
You knew that?

790
00:34:39,498 --> 00:34:41,914
'Cause your brown. Browns don't
usually know that's illegal.

791
00:34:43,669 --> 00:34:44,669
What kind of brown are you?

792
00:34:44,703 --> 00:34:46,004
You're nice and brown. I like it.

793
00:34:46,038 --> 00:34:47,088
<i>Thank you.</i>

794
00:34:47,122 --> 00:34:48,756
Thank you. Can you answer me?

795
00:34:48,790 --> 00:34:50,508
What the fuck?

796
00:34:50,542 --> 00:34:54,762
You can't hear me? What, are you retarded?

797
00:34:54,796 --> 00:34:55,680
I guess the word is "deaf."

798
00:34:55,714 --> 00:34:56,431
I'm sorry.

799
00:34:56,465 --> 00:34:59,267
What nationality are you?

800
00:34:59,301 --> 00:35:00,768
Mexican, Paco. Yell it out.

801
00:35:00,802 --> 00:35:03,187
What the fuck?

802
00:35:03,221 --> 00:35:05,471
This is your country.

803
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:09,661
You're a good swimmer and
you have good swimmers.

804
00:35:09,695 --> 00:35:11,946
I gotta be careful.

805
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:14,616
I'm probably pregnant just
making eye-contact with you,

806
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:16,315
you little fucker.

807
00:35:17,869 --> 00:35:19,287
Do you have kids? Of course.

808
00:35:19,321 --> 00:35:21,204
You're born with kids, aren't you?

809
00:35:25,210 --> 00:35:26,544
I'll punch a kid in the throat.

810
00:35:26,578 --> 00:35:29,047
I really will.

811
00:35:29,081 --> 00:35:30,131
You have to hit them.

812
00:35:30,165 --> 00:35:31,466
And they know they can
get away with shit, right?

813
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:34,185
'Cause every kid is born with,
like, an iPhone or an iPad

814
00:35:34,219 --> 00:35:35,970
with an app to download,

815
00:35:36,004 --> 00:35:37,972
"Mommy and Daddy are Hitting
Me, Come Get these Fuckers."

816
00:35:38,006 --> 00:35:39,190
Right?

817
00:35:39,224 --> 00:35:40,358
And that's not fair.

818
00:35:40,392 --> 00:35:41,359
I think they should have to go through

819
00:35:41,393 --> 00:35:43,311
the same shit we went through, right?

820
00:35:43,345 --> 00:35:44,696
Here's what happened:

821
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:46,030
A couple weeks ago, I'm on the
beach with my brother, right?

822
00:35:46,064 --> 00:35:47,565
We're hanging out, his
eight-year-old daughter

823
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:49,534
screaming in his face.

824
00:35:49,568 --> 00:35:50,535
Screaming

825
00:35:50,569 --> 00:35:51,486
'cause she knows she can get away with it.

826
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,737
I'm like, "Yo, John, what are you doing?

827
00:35:52,771 --> 00:35:55,021
"Choke that fucking kid out."

828
00:35:57,242 --> 00:35:58,660
I'm not saying kill the kid.

829
00:35:58,694 --> 00:36:00,328
I'm saying let her lose her legs a minute.

830
00:36:00,362 --> 00:36:02,028
You remember that shit?

831
00:36:03,532 --> 00:36:05,581
<i>Right?</i>

832
00:36:08,036 --> 00:36:09,671
Your dad would grab you
by the back of your neck.

833
00:36:09,705 --> 00:36:11,506
You're like, "Oh, fuck,
I can't feel my right leg.

834
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:15,009
"I think I'm gonna tag out right now

835
00:36:15,043 --> 00:36:16,227
"or not talk back."

836
00:36:16,261 --> 00:36:17,178
<i>Tag out!</i>

837
00:36:17,212 --> 00:36:18,680
Tag out, yeah.

838
00:36:18,714 --> 00:36:20,846
I like this whore. She's into it.

839
00:36:22,217 --> 00:36:24,519
She's like, "Tag out!
I swallow, put it in."

840
00:36:24,553 --> 00:36:26,571
All right.

841
00:36:26,605 --> 00:36:28,106
Ask Paco. He'll put it in.

842
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:29,857
He don't give a shit.

843
00:36:29,891 --> 00:36:31,859
I do, I do. I fuck for pigment.

844
00:36:31,893 --> 00:36:32,860
I have to.

845
00:36:32,894 --> 00:36:34,746
Look how white I am. That's uncomfortable.

846
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:35,697
Right?

847
00:36:35,731 --> 00:36:36,614
Like, when I go to the doctor,

848
00:36:36,648 --> 00:36:37,582
they don't even take blood.

849
00:36:37,616 --> 00:36:40,702
They're like, "Bitch, we can see it."

850
00:36:40,736 --> 00:36:42,036
So, I do, I like them dark.

851
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:44,122
Not too dark. I don't wanna kill my father.

852
00:36:44,156 --> 00:36:47,573
Like, dark enough...

853
00:36:50,579 --> 00:36:52,046
I like older guys, too. I do.

854
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:53,381
I like them like you, man.

855
00:36:53,415 --> 00:36:55,049
You're awesome. I need your credit.

856
00:36:55,083 --> 00:36:56,801
That's it, stretch it out.

857
00:36:56,835 --> 00:36:58,052
Fuck yeah.

858
00:36:58,086 --> 00:37:00,138
He sat back to show me his old balls.

859
00:37:00,172 --> 00:37:01,887
<i>That's awesome.</i>

860
00:37:03,592 --> 00:37:05,443
I do, I like older guys, man.

861
00:37:05,477 --> 00:37:06,394
I do, I love them.

862
00:37:06,428 --> 00:37:07,278
I always do.

863
00:37:07,312 --> 00:37:08,730
This is the thing.

864
00:37:08,764 --> 00:37:09,564
See, your young, Paco.

865
00:37:09,598 --> 00:37:10,565
You don't know this yet.

866
00:37:10,599 --> 00:37:13,451
When you cum, man, shit still comes out,

867
00:37:13,485 --> 00:37:14,402
right?

868
00:37:14,436 --> 00:37:16,904
Yeah, it's like an unruly garden hose.

869
00:37:16,938 --> 00:37:19,574
That shit just sprays.

870
00:37:19,608 --> 00:37:21,793
Not this fucker.

871
00:37:21,827 --> 00:37:23,327
When the old guys cum,

872
00:37:23,361 --> 00:37:26,080
nothing comes out.

873
00:37:26,114 --> 00:37:26,748
I'm not kidding.

874
00:37:26,782 --> 00:37:27,415
I'm with this guy, right?

875
00:37:27,449 --> 00:37:28,416
I'm doing my thing 'cause

876
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:31,284
Lent was over and I could get back into it.

877
00:37:33,705 --> 00:37:35,423
So, I'm, like, doing my thing, right?

878
00:37:35,457 --> 00:37:38,257
I thought he came, I felt a breeze.

879
00:37:39,511 --> 00:37:40,428
<i>It was like a "pfff."</i>

880
00:37:40,462 --> 00:37:41,961
I was like, "Oh, shit."

881
00:37:43,215 --> 00:37:44,766
But I didn't feel anything,

882
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:45,683
I couldn't find anything.

883
00:37:45,717 --> 00:37:46,934
I'm like, "Hey, dude, did you just fart

884
00:37:46,968 --> 00:37:48,467
"out of your dick?"

885
00:37:50,522 --> 00:37:52,990
"Hey, man, I gotta do
a show. What the fuck?"

886
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:54,525
I was freaking out.

887
00:37:54,559 --> 00:37:55,526
And then, like, two days later,

888
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:58,027
you're like, "Oh, shit, is that glitter?"

889
00:38:00,649 --> 00:38:04,200
No, that's Old Man
River's balls on my face.

890
00:38:07,072 --> 00:38:09,121
She just threw up in
her mouth a little bit.

891
00:38:10,492 --> 00:38:12,710
It's all right, it tastes the same.

892
00:38:12,744 --> 00:38:14,293
So...

893
00:38:16,581 --> 00:38:18,015
I do, I date all different
kind of guys, too.

894
00:38:18,049 --> 00:38:19,517
I think you should date every kind of guy.

895
00:38:19,551 --> 00:38:21,519
I date an Asian guy. You
ever date an Asian guy?

896
00:38:21,553 --> 00:38:22,970
<i>Do I what?</i>

897
00:38:23,004 --> 00:38:25,004
What the fuck is happening?

898
00:38:26,341 --> 00:38:27,892
Have you ever dated an Asian guy?

899
00:38:27,926 --> 00:38:29,644
<i>Yes, you have. Good for you.</i>

900
00:38:29,678 --> 00:38:31,896
I did, too, because I think
you should try everything, man.

901
00:38:31,930 --> 00:38:33,815
I dated this Asian guy for a little while.

902
00:38:33,849 --> 00:38:35,700
It was my first lesbian experience,

903
00:38:35,734 --> 00:38:37,516
but we had...

904
00:38:41,406 --> 00:38:42,490
Dude, what the fuck happened?

905
00:38:42,524 --> 00:38:45,024
We dropped trou, I was the one swingin'.

906
00:38:46,444 --> 00:38:47,411
That fucked me up.

907
00:38:47,445 --> 00:38:48,496
I though it was Groundhog Day.

908
00:38:48,530 --> 00:38:50,998
I'm looking for a shadow.

909
00:38:51,032 --> 00:38:53,000
This guy was like a mannequin.

910
00:38:53,034 --> 00:38:54,168
He was all smooth in the front.

911
00:38:54,202 --> 00:38:55,887
I was like, "What is happening?"

912
00:38:55,921 --> 00:38:56,888
Plus, it's weird.

913
00:38:56,922 --> 00:38:57,839
If you go down on him,

914
00:38:57,873 --> 00:38:59,173
you get hungry an hour later.

915
00:38:59,207 --> 00:39:01,040
That is a fact.

916
00:39:02,093 --> 00:39:03,761
All right, you guys are fantastic.

917
00:39:03,795 --> 00:39:05,261
Thank you so much.

918
00:39:06,381 --> 00:39:08,547
Give it up for Andrew Dice Clay!

919
00:39:12,437 --> 00:39:15,022
Eleanor Kerrigan. Take a bow, Eleanor.

920
00:39:15,056 --> 00:39:16,889
Hurry up, take a bow.

921
00:39:25,233 --> 00:39:26,834
<i>Andrew is the best!</i>

922
00:39:26,868 --> 00:39:30,204
I know what you're thinkin'.

923
00:39:30,238 --> 00:39:31,787
I ate it.

924
00:39:36,077 --> 00:39:37,461
We got more.

925
00:39:37,495 --> 00:39:39,547
We got right from here, right from L.A.,

926
00:39:39,581 --> 00:39:44,302
the Inland Empire, I found these guys.

927
00:39:44,336 --> 00:39:45,887
Cory and Chad.

928
00:39:45,921 --> 00:39:48,806
Ladies and gentlemen, get ready for

929
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,923
the Smash Brothers.

930
00:39:57,983 --> 00:39:59,617
Ladies, we like to say
the word "bitch" a lot.

931
00:39:59,651 --> 00:40:01,402
So, if you get offended tonight

932
00:40:01,436 --> 00:40:02,904
that we say the word "bitch,"

933
00:40:02,938 --> 00:40:04,405
You're probably a fuckin' bitch.

934
00:40:04,439 --> 00:40:06,574
That's right.

935
00:40:06,608 --> 00:40:08,441
So, fuck you, bitch.

936
00:40:10,028 --> 00:40:11,245
I'm the good twin, girls.

937
00:40:11,279 --> 00:40:13,164
Whatever you're into, I'm into.

938
00:40:13,198 --> 00:40:14,749
Say you're into scrapbooking,

939
00:40:14,783 --> 00:40:16,133
hand me those scissors, I'll cut shit up

940
00:40:16,167 --> 00:40:19,253
all goddamn night for you.

941
00:40:19,287 --> 00:40:21,255
I like to make love.
I take it low and slow.

942
00:40:21,289 --> 00:40:23,422
They call me the "Crockpot of Pussy."

943
00:40:26,011 --> 00:40:26,844
This guy's the bad twin.

944
00:40:26,878 --> 00:40:28,312
Ladies, I like it rough.

945
00:40:28,346 --> 00:40:29,263
You like your hair pulled,

946
00:40:29,297 --> 00:40:31,148
dildo in the ass and punched in the ribs,

947
00:40:31,182 --> 00:40:32,965
holler at your boy. Fuckin' a.

948
00:40:34,135 --> 00:40:36,771
'Cause I can't cum unless I'm
fuckin' choking you, bitch.

949
00:40:36,805 --> 00:40:38,105
Chris Brown taught me that.

950
00:40:38,139 --> 00:40:39,273
Fuck yes.

951
00:40:39,307 --> 00:40:40,608
We like older women.

952
00:40:40,642 --> 00:40:42,276
We like them from 35 years old

953
00:40:42,310 --> 00:40:43,277
to dead.

954
00:40:43,311 --> 00:40:44,111
That's what we like.

955
00:40:44,145 --> 00:40:44,946
Fuck yes.

956
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:47,281
You young girls from 18 to 34,

957
00:40:47,315 --> 00:40:48,115
you're good to finger-bang,

958
00:40:48,149 --> 00:40:49,700
suck a titty and shit like that.

959
00:40:49,734 --> 00:40:51,502
But you young bitches do not know how

960
00:40:51,536 --> 00:40:53,955
to suck a dick at your age.

961
00:40:53,989 --> 00:40:55,006
Hey, prove us wrong, bitch.

962
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,958
Prove us wrong.

963
00:40:56,992 --> 00:40:58,175
Come on up here. You can have a twin

964
00:40:58,209 --> 00:41:00,628
taste-test challenge like
Coke vs. Pepsi in '91.

965
00:41:00,662 --> 00:41:01,963
That's right.

966
00:41:01,997 --> 00:41:03,965
Find out which one of us drank eggnog

967
00:41:03,999 --> 00:41:06,549
and which one drank
fucking pineapple juice.

968
00:41:08,336 --> 00:41:10,137
But, fellas, older women are where it's at.

969
00:41:10,171 --> 00:41:11,806
Thirty-five and up, you
fuck 'em good enough,

970
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,024
you're leaving with a pack lunch

971
00:41:13,058 --> 00:41:14,475
and a dozen chocolate chip cookies.

972
00:41:14,509 --> 00:41:15,526
Fuck yes.

973
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:16,694
Hey, we don't make the rules.

974
00:41:16,728 --> 00:41:17,645
Jesus does.

975
00:41:17,679 --> 00:41:18,811
Amen.

976
00:41:20,765 --> 00:41:22,400
We love older women, though.

977
00:41:22,434 --> 00:41:23,651
We were in Vegas last weekend

978
00:41:23,685 --> 00:41:24,535
doing a show.

979
00:41:24,569 --> 00:41:26,153
After the show, we shaved our balls,

980
00:41:26,187 --> 00:41:27,872
we hit the fucking town
You know what I mean?

981
00:41:27,906 --> 00:41:28,823
Fuck yes.

982
00:41:28,857 --> 00:41:29,991
And we're in the club, we spotted these two

983
00:41:30,025 --> 00:41:31,242
45-year-old
cougars.

984
00:41:31,276 --> 00:41:32,376
Now, they said they're 45,

985
00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:33,294
but when the lights came on,

986
00:41:33,328 --> 00:41:34,328
they looked 65.

987
00:41:34,362 --> 00:41:35,997
Fuck it.

988
00:41:36,031 --> 00:41:37,081
But we're in Vegas. Let's do this shit.

989
00:41:37,115 --> 00:41:38,132
- You know what I'm saying?
- Fuck yes.

990
00:41:38,166 --> 00:41:40,167
So, we're dancing,
we're having a good time.

991
00:41:40,201 --> 00:41:41,002
We bought these two bitches

992
00:41:41,036 --> 00:41:43,888
nine shots of Patron, each.

993
00:41:43,922 --> 00:41:48,342
In Las Vegas, that cost
us 975 fucking dollars.

994
00:41:48,376 --> 00:41:50,344
They owe us anal at
this fucking point, okay?

995
00:41:50,378 --> 00:41:51,846
Hey, we don't make the rules.

996
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:52,563
Jesus does.

997
00:41:52,597 --> 00:41:54,765
Amen.

998
00:41:54,799 --> 00:41:56,434
Now, ladies, you're not gonna like the next

999
00:41:56,468 --> 00:41:58,019
five to seven minutes
of this fucking story.

1000
00:41:58,053 --> 00:42:00,187
But you brought this shit upon yourselves.

1001
00:42:00,221 --> 00:42:01,939
That's right.

1002
00:42:01,973 --> 00:42:03,741
Now, we're dancing,
we're having a good time.

1003
00:42:03,775 --> 00:42:04,575
We don't look like it,

1004
00:42:04,609 --> 00:42:05,743
but we're some dancing motherfuckers.

1005
00:42:05,777 --> 00:42:07,078
We're in the club, ♪ suit and tie ♪

1006
00:42:07,112 --> 00:42:07,862
♪ suit and tie ♪

1007
00:42:07,896 --> 00:42:08,913
We're fucking gettin' it.

1008
00:42:08,947 --> 00:42:09,864
You gotta dance.

1009
00:42:09,898 --> 00:42:10,948
If you're single and you're in the club,

1010
00:42:10,982 --> 00:42:12,249
you better be dancing a unless you got

1011
00:42:12,283 --> 00:42:13,701
a pocketful of GHB.

1012
00:42:13,735 --> 00:42:15,870
- You better be fucking dancing.
- That's right.

1013
00:42:15,904 --> 00:42:17,288
So, we're dancing,
we're having a good time.

1014
00:42:17,322 --> 00:42:19,874
Now, we spent a thousand fucking
dollars on these two bitches.

1015
00:42:19,908 --> 00:42:21,709
We get them outside the club, I'm like,

1016
00:42:21,743 --> 00:42:23,928
"Look, Griselda, Rosario,
listen up, bitch."

1017
00:42:23,962 --> 00:42:26,047
Oh, they're Mexican.

1018
00:42:26,081 --> 00:42:28,382
Oh, yes, that's how it rolls.

1019
00:42:28,416 --> 00:42:29,717
She looks at us and goes,

1020
00:42:29,751 --> 00:42:31,052
"Look, guys, we're just gonna be honest.

1021
00:42:31,086 --> 00:42:32,386
"We're not having sex with you because

1022
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:34,555
"we both just started our periods today."

1023
00:42:34,589 --> 00:42:36,891
Yeah, we love this scenario, boys.

1024
00:42:36,925 --> 00:42:38,392
We call this scenario

1025
00:42:38,426 --> 00:42:39,393
"Shark Week."

1026
00:42:39,427 --> 00:42:40,809
That's right.

1027
00:42:41,930 --> 00:42:43,447
Marinate on that for a minute.

1028
00:42:43,481 --> 00:42:44,231
Yeah.

1029
00:42:44,265 --> 00:42:45,116
Now, ladies,

1030
00:42:45,150 --> 00:42:45,866
you're probably in the crowd going,

1031
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:46,734
"This is fucking bullshit.

1032
00:42:46,768 --> 00:42:48,402
"Shark Week happens when it happens.

1033
00:42:48,436 --> 00:42:49,904
"We can't fucking help it. It's nature."

1034
00:42:49,938 --> 00:42:50,955
Ladies, you're right.

1035
00:42:50,989 --> 00:42:52,156
If you start your Shark Week

1036
00:42:52,190 --> 00:42:53,157
and we're at our house,

1037
00:42:53,191 --> 00:42:53,908
we'll go to the garage

1038
00:42:53,942 --> 00:42:54,742
and we can get a Sham-Wow

1039
00:42:54,776 --> 00:42:55,493
and we can fucking do this.

1040
00:42:55,527 --> 00:42:57,411
Fuck yes.

1041
00:42:57,445 --> 00:42:58,662
I don't know if you've
seen the commercial or not

1042
00:42:58,696 --> 00:42:59,747
for Sham-Wow, folks.

1043
00:42:59,781 --> 00:43:01,582
One Sham-Wow can soak up

1044
00:43:01,616 --> 00:43:04,001
a gallon of spilled paint in your garage.

1045
00:43:04,035 --> 00:43:05,753
That's a shitload of Shark Week.

1046
00:43:05,787 --> 00:43:06,504
Right.

1047
00:43:06,538 --> 00:43:08,055
And if you're a grown man,

1048
00:43:08,089 --> 00:43:09,256
Shark Week's got you at least one time

1049
00:43:09,290 --> 00:43:10,174
in your life.

1050
00:43:10,208 --> 00:43:12,343
And by "grown man," I mean over 25,

1051
00:43:12,377 --> 00:43:13,761
not wearing skinny jeans
like a fucking bitch

1052
00:43:13,795 --> 00:43:14,845
is what I mean.

1053
00:43:14,879 --> 00:43:16,597
Right.

1054
00:43:16,631 --> 00:43:17,932
You can't be tough wearing skinny jeans.

1055
00:43:17,966 --> 00:43:19,183
I don't give a shit.

1056
00:43:19,217 --> 00:43:20,651
Especially the guys that
are wearing skinny jeans

1057
00:43:20,685 --> 00:43:22,937
and they got a muffin top blowing
out of their fucking pants.

1058
00:43:22,971 --> 00:43:23,771
That's right.

1059
00:43:23,805 --> 00:43:26,023
If you're a grown man, 25 years old,

1060
00:43:26,057 --> 00:43:27,358
and you're wearing skinny jeans

1061
00:43:27,392 --> 00:43:28,776
and I can see your
dick's going to the right,

1062
00:43:28,810 --> 00:43:30,661
you have 50 cents and a
lighter in your left pocket,

1063
00:43:30,695 --> 00:43:32,613
you're gonna get a urinary tract infection,

1064
00:43:32,647 --> 00:43:35,199
you little bitch. That's what you are.

1065
00:43:35,233 --> 00:43:36,450
You better hope you don't go to jail

1066
00:43:36,484 --> 00:43:37,501
because guys like me will make you

1067
00:43:37,535 --> 00:43:39,453
suck my dick, that's for sure.

1068
00:43:39,487 --> 00:43:41,622
And it ain't gay 'cause it's a secret,

1069
00:43:41,656 --> 00:43:43,288
so shhh.

1070
00:43:45,210 --> 00:43:46,043
Not me.

1071
00:43:46,077 --> 00:43:47,211
This is the gay twin.

1072
00:43:47,245 --> 00:43:49,680
I'm the fucking straight twin.

1073
00:43:49,714 --> 00:43:50,965
We're identical, we don't give a shit.

1074
00:43:50,999 --> 00:43:52,349
He's a fag, too. I don't give a shit.

1075
00:43:52,383 --> 00:43:54,468
No. One time my brother
got his dick sucked in jail

1076
00:43:54,502 --> 00:43:57,054
for a pack of cigarettes and
this guy don't even smoke.

1077
00:43:57,088 --> 00:43:58,556
It was Top Ramen Thursday,

1078
00:43:58,590 --> 00:44:00,858
I don't give a shit.

1079
00:44:00,892 --> 00:44:02,309
Now, if you're a grown man,

1080
00:44:02,343 --> 00:44:03,978
Shark Week's got you at least one time.

1081
00:44:04,012 --> 00:44:04,812
Right?

1082
00:44:04,846 --> 00:44:06,230
You're in bed, you're making love,

1083
00:44:06,264 --> 00:44:07,198
giving her the best

1084
00:44:07,232 --> 00:44:08,649
14 and three-quarter pumps you got, right?

1085
00:44:08,683 --> 00:44:10,034
You know that's right.

1086
00:44:10,068 --> 00:44:10,985
The lights were out.

1087
00:44:11,019 --> 00:44:11,986
You can't see her and she can't see you.

1088
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:13,037
But all of a sudden,

1089
00:44:13,071 --> 00:44:14,155
she gets really wet

1090
00:44:14,189 --> 00:44:14,989
and you, you're just like,

1091
00:44:15,023 --> 00:44:16,373
"Tsst, tsst."

1092
00:44:16,407 --> 00:44:18,159
You're thinking, "Fuck, I bet my balls look

1093
00:44:18,193 --> 00:44:19,994
"like two walnuts dipped
in yogurt right now."

1094
00:44:20,028 --> 00:44:21,879
Hell yeah.

1095
00:44:21,913 --> 00:44:22,913
But you don't know
because you can't see her.

1096
00:44:22,947 --> 00:44:24,215
So you thought you made her squirt,

1097
00:44:24,249 --> 00:44:25,166
so you check your nuts.

1098
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:26,550
You don't know she started her period,

1099
00:44:26,584 --> 00:44:27,334
so you're like, "Fuck it,"

1100
00:44:27,368 --> 00:44:28,169
you just wipe your sweat.

1101
00:44:28,203 --> 00:44:30,387
You're like, "Fuck it."

1102
00:44:30,421 --> 00:44:32,506
You have no idea that your comforter

1103
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:34,225
looks like a "Saw III" movie
at this fucking point.

1104
00:44:34,259 --> 00:44:35,874
Right.

1105
00:44:36,928 --> 00:44:38,012
For you old school players,

1106
00:44:38,046 --> 00:44:40,264
it looks like 1987
Nickelodeon "Double Dare."

1107
00:44:40,298 --> 00:44:41,599
The red team won, motherfucker.

1108
00:44:41,633 --> 00:44:43,048
That's right.

1109
00:44:44,385 --> 00:44:45,352
Now, you have no idea.

1110
00:44:45,386 --> 00:44:46,604
Neither one of you know you just pulled

1111
00:44:46,638 --> 00:44:48,189
the plug out of the transmission, right?

1112
00:44:48,223 --> 00:44:48,856
Right.

1113
00:44:48,890 --> 00:44:49,907
You don't know.

1114
00:44:49,941 --> 00:44:51,192
You don't know 'cause the lights are out.

1115
00:44:51,226 --> 00:44:52,409
You thought you made her squirt

1116
00:44:52,443 --> 00:44:53,577
or something hot like that

1117
00:44:53,611 --> 00:44:54,695
Right.

1118
00:44:54,729 --> 00:44:55,613
You're like, "Fuck, those five free videos

1119
00:44:55,647 --> 00:44:57,081
"on YouPorn really are working out."

1120
00:44:57,115 --> 00:44:58,365
Fuck yeah.

1121
00:44:58,399 --> 00:44:59,416
Now, you're about to cum,

1122
00:44:59,450 --> 00:45:00,784
so, like a gentleman, you pull out

1123
00:45:00,818 --> 00:45:02,870
and cum on her stomach because
that's what gentlemen do.

1124
00:45:02,904 --> 00:45:03,837
Amen.

1125
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:05,873
Now, whenever a man cums on you, ladies,

1126
00:45:05,907 --> 00:45:07,374
we always ask you the same question:

1127
00:45:07,408 --> 00:45:09,093
Do you want my sock or my boxers

1128
00:45:09,127 --> 00:45:11,595
to mop this shit up with?

1129
00:45:11,629 --> 00:45:12,713
The shit's running down your ribs,

1130
00:45:12,747 --> 00:45:13,714
you're probably getting both.

1131
00:45:13,748 --> 00:45:14,465
Right.

1132
00:45:14,499 --> 00:45:15,549
Now you don't know.

1133
00:45:15,583 --> 00:45:16,267
Neither one of you know.

1134
00:45:16,301 --> 00:45:17,468
You just shot your load

1135
00:45:17,502 --> 00:45:18,636
and now you're gonna go in the bathroom

1136
00:45:18,670 --> 00:45:19,720
and wash your dick up with conditioner,

1137
00:45:19,754 --> 00:45:21,754
give it that new car smell, right?

1138
00:45:22,924 --> 00:45:24,725
It kind of, like, puts the puppy breath

1139
00:45:24,759 --> 00:45:25,893
back into your dog.

1140
00:45:25,927 --> 00:45:26,727
Right.

1141
00:45:26,761 --> 00:45:27,895
And I tell the girls, "Hey, girl,

1142
00:45:27,929 --> 00:45:29,897
"you love puppy breath? Ooh.

1143
00:45:29,931 --> 00:45:31,448
"You suck my dick good now,

1144
00:45:31,482 --> 00:45:32,616
"you're gonna leave with kennel cough."

1145
00:45:32,650 --> 00:45:35,152
I'll tell you that much
right now. Fuck yeah.

1146
00:45:35,186 --> 00:45:37,154
So, the lights are out,
you go in the bathroom,

1147
00:45:37,188 --> 00:45:38,622
you turn on the faucet,
and you click on the light,

1148
00:45:38,656 --> 00:45:39,740
you finally look in the mirror

1149
00:45:39,774 --> 00:45:40,991
and see what she fucking did to you.

1150
00:45:41,025 --> 00:45:42,209
What she did.

1151
00:45:42,243 --> 00:45:43,494
You're washing your hands, you look up,

1152
00:45:43,528 --> 00:45:44,662
you're like,

1153
00:45:44,696 --> 00:45:46,830
"What the fuck?!"

1154
00:45:46,864 --> 00:45:48,582
Your face looks like
Wilson from "Cast Away."

1155
00:45:48,616 --> 00:45:51,335
Wilson!

1156
00:45:51,369 --> 00:45:52,503
Come back, Wilson!

1157
00:45:52,537 --> 00:45:53,470
Wilson!

1158
00:45:53,504 --> 00:45:54,838
No!

1159
00:45:54,872 --> 00:45:56,507
You don't know what the fuck's going on

1160
00:45:56,541 --> 00:45:57,424
at this point.

1161
00:45:57,458 --> 00:45:58,425
You're like, "Fuck, am I turned on?

1162
00:45:58,459 --> 00:46:00,144
"Am I disgusted?"

1163
00:46:00,178 --> 00:46:01,595
You're like, "I kinda look tough.

1164
00:46:01,629 --> 00:46:03,430
"I look like Mel Gibson
in 'Braveheart' right now.

1165
00:46:03,464 --> 00:46:05,599
"I'll tell you that shit."

1166
00:46:05,633 --> 00:46:06,350
"Freedom!"

1167
00:46:06,384 --> 00:46:07,351
Hey, we don't make the rules.

1168
00:46:07,385 --> 00:46:08,102
Jesus does.

1169
00:46:08,136 --> 00:46:09,268
Amen.

1170
00:46:12,307 --> 00:46:13,490
And bodily functions, Shark Week

1171
00:46:13,524 --> 00:46:14,325
don't scare us, ladies.

1172
00:46:14,359 --> 00:46:15,659
Say I got you doggy-style, right?

1173
00:46:15,693 --> 00:46:17,778
You let out a little fart
or something like that.

1174
00:46:17,812 --> 00:46:18,829
I don't even get nervous.

1175
00:46:18,863 --> 00:46:19,863
I'm like, "Let it out, Boo-Boo Bear.

1176
00:46:19,897 --> 00:46:22,283
- "Let all that shit out."
- Fuck yeah.

1177
00:46:22,317 --> 00:46:23,784
Because, ladies, if you think about it,

1178
00:46:23,818 --> 00:46:25,202
when you fart during sex,

1179
00:46:25,236 --> 00:46:27,037
our dicks made that fart

1180
00:46:27,071 --> 00:46:27,788
happen.

1181
00:46:27,822 --> 00:46:29,373
You know what I mean?

1182
00:46:29,407 --> 00:46:30,374
Those are some good-ass dicks.

1183
00:46:30,408 --> 00:46:31,959
I mean, they're little, but they're good.

1184
00:46:31,993 --> 00:46:33,127
- You know what I mean?
- Damn right.

1185
00:46:33,161 --> 00:46:35,879
Like, let's all just think
about this for a minute.

1186
00:46:35,913 --> 00:46:37,381
Our dicks are so good...

1187
00:46:37,415 --> 00:46:38,015
Damn good.

1188
00:46:38,049 --> 00:46:39,133
so powerful...

1189
00:46:39,167 --> 00:46:40,217
So fuckin' powerful.

1190
00:46:40,251 --> 00:46:41,969
that we stuck our dick in one hole

1191
00:46:42,003 --> 00:46:44,386
and then pushed air out
of another fuckin' hole.

1192
00:46:46,174 --> 00:46:47,191
The more you know.

1193
00:46:47,225 --> 00:46:48,726
Like I said, our dicks are good,

1194
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:50,477
but they're little. You
know what I'm saying?

1195
00:46:50,511 --> 00:46:51,645
And we tell the girls right from jump,

1196
00:46:51,679 --> 00:46:53,480
we're not trying to shortsale anybody.

1197
00:46:53,514 --> 00:46:55,149
I'm like, "Hey,

1198
00:46:55,183 --> 00:46:56,066
"we got little dicks.

1199
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:58,235
"We're letting you know from jump.

1200
00:46:58,269 --> 00:46:59,820
"What we can offer you is rhythm,

1201
00:46:59,854 --> 00:47:00,738
"stamina, endurance,

1202
00:47:00,772 --> 00:47:02,039
"and two credit cards that work."

1203
00:47:02,073 --> 00:47:03,856
Ta-dah!

1204
00:47:07,862 --> 00:47:09,496
Fellas, did you notice
anything about that joke?

1205
00:47:09,530 --> 00:47:10,881
Every bitch in here, alls they heard was,

1206
00:47:10,915 --> 00:47:12,583
"Blah, blah, blah, two
credit cards that work."

1207
00:47:12,617 --> 00:47:13,916
Fuckin' bullshit.

1208
00:47:15,703 --> 00:47:17,171
And remember, boys, when
you have a little dick,

1209
00:47:17,205 --> 00:47:18,756
your moves should always be doggy-style.

1210
00:47:18,790 --> 00:47:20,674
Put on your golf cleats, too, so you can

1211
00:47:20,708 --> 00:47:22,009
push off the headboard and get a half-inch

1212
00:47:22,043 --> 00:47:23,060
deeper into her pussy, too.

1213
00:47:23,094 --> 00:47:24,178
That's right.

1214
00:47:24,212 --> 00:47:25,062
Remember that shit.

1215
00:47:25,096 --> 00:47:27,064
I wear my WWF gold championship belt

1216
00:47:27,098 --> 00:47:28,349
and my fuckin' golf cleats

1217
00:47:28,383 --> 00:47:29,316
and that's it.

1218
00:47:29,350 --> 00:47:30,684
Come to bed because you're about to fuck

1219
00:47:30,718 --> 00:47:33,103
- the champ, motherfucker.
- You know that's right.

1220
00:47:33,137 --> 00:47:33,854
Put it this way,

1221
00:47:33,888 --> 00:47:34,688
when you got a little dick,

1222
00:47:34,722 --> 00:47:35,906
if you're fucking her doggy-style,

1223
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:37,024
she's focused northbound.

1224
00:47:37,058 --> 00:47:39,610
And she has no idea what's going on

1225
00:47:39,644 --> 00:47:40,694
southbound back here.

1226
00:47:40,728 --> 00:47:41,445
Nothin'.

1227
00:47:41,479 --> 00:47:42,329
That could be your dick

1228
00:47:42,363 --> 00:47:43,113
or that could be the remote control

1229
00:47:43,147 --> 00:47:44,081
from the fucking TV.

1230
00:47:44,115 --> 00:47:44,865
You know what I'm saying?

1231
00:47:44,899 --> 00:47:46,283
You don't know.

1232
00:47:46,317 --> 00:47:49,420
Not everybody's got a twin brother.

1233
00:47:49,454 --> 00:47:50,087
Right?

1234
00:47:50,121 --> 00:47:50,871
Ah?

1235
00:47:50,905 --> 00:47:52,955
- For Jesus.
- You know that's right.

1236
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:58,262
Oh, it's so good to be dirty

1237
00:47:58,296 --> 00:47:59,880
and say whatever the fuck you want, man.

1238
00:47:59,914 --> 00:48:02,015
Fuck. I love it.

1239
00:48:02,049 --> 00:48:03,384
I will fuck you. I don't
even know what you look like.

1240
00:48:03,418 --> 00:48:04,385
So, I don't give a shit.

1241
00:48:04,419 --> 00:48:05,219
<i>Yeah.</i>

1242
00:48:05,253 --> 00:48:05,886
<i>That means if he's fucking you,</i>

1243
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:07,721
I'm the camera guy.

1244
00:48:07,755 --> 00:48:08,389
<i>Fuck yeah.</i>

1245
00:48:08,423 --> 00:48:10,224
We only got one question.

1246
00:48:10,258 --> 00:48:12,090
Are you allergic to duct tape?

1247
00:48:13,177 --> 00:48:13,977
<i>No?</i>

1248
00:48:14,011 --> 00:48:15,612
Then we are fucking you.

1249
00:48:15,646 --> 00:48:16,480
This is gonna work out.

1250
00:48:16,514 --> 00:48:18,282
She's Latina. She'll keep it.

1251
00:48:18,316 --> 00:48:19,066
Fuck that shit.

1252
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:20,067
Yeah.

1253
00:48:20,101 --> 00:48:21,652
Make sure, boys, when you fuck a Latina,

1254
00:48:21,686 --> 00:48:23,070
you be extremely careful.

1255
00:48:23,104 --> 00:48:26,156
They're the most fertile
creatures in the jungle.

1256
00:48:26,190 --> 00:48:26,957
They are.

1257
00:48:26,991 --> 00:48:28,075
I don't know if you know this,

1258
00:48:28,109 --> 00:48:31,128
but if you put your <i>horchata</i>
in her <i>piñata,</i>

1259
00:48:31,162 --> 00:48:33,747
you're gonna have a fucking
<i>kukui</i> in nine months.

1260
00:48:33,781 --> 00:48:35,163
I swear to God.

1261
00:48:36,868 --> 00:48:38,302
For you white people that didn't know

1262
00:48:38,336 --> 00:48:39,420
what we just said,

1263
00:48:39,454 --> 00:48:40,471
ask your gardener or babysitter,

1264
00:48:40,505 --> 00:48:41,922
these are great Mexican jokes.

1265
00:48:41,956 --> 00:48:43,288
Fuckin' a they are.

1266
00:48:45,126 --> 00:48:45,843
And Mexicans, I don't know if

1267
00:48:45,877 --> 00:48:46,677
you white people know this,

1268
00:48:46,711 --> 00:48:47,761
they communicate to one another

1269
00:48:47,795 --> 00:48:48,929
simply by whistling.

1270
00:48:48,963 --> 00:48:50,431
Oh, they barely talk.

1271
00:48:50,465 --> 00:48:51,598
You'll hear them in
the grocery store, like,

1272
00:48:51,632 --> 00:48:53,650
"Maria, [whistles]."

1273
00:48:53,684 --> 00:48:55,269
White people, look around.

1274
00:48:55,303 --> 00:48:57,604
Thirteen Mexicans here know
what the fuck he just said.

1275
00:48:57,638 --> 00:48:59,690
Fuckin' a.

1276
00:48:59,724 --> 00:49:00,941
You heard of the "Dog Whisperer"?

1277
00:49:00,975 --> 00:49:02,109
We're the "Cholo Whisperers," <i>ese</i>.

1278
00:49:02,143 --> 00:49:04,445
<i>Simon.</i>

1279
00:49:04,479 --> 00:49:05,662
He said, "Maria, hurry
up and do the laundry

1280
00:49:05,696 --> 00:49:06,663
"before I hit you."

1281
00:49:06,697 --> 00:49:08,030
That's what he just said.

1282
00:49:09,534 --> 00:49:10,834
You gotta be careful
hitting a Latina, though.

1283
00:49:10,868 --> 00:49:11,869
You can hit a white girl

1284
00:49:11,903 --> 00:49:13,120
'cause she's just gonna
cry and call your mom.

1285
00:49:13,154 --> 00:49:14,121
Right.

1286
00:49:14,155 --> 00:49:16,123
You hit a Mexican, she's gonna wake you up

1287
00:49:16,157 --> 00:49:17,624
at 2:30 in the morning with a sharpened up

1288
00:49:17,658 --> 00:49:18,959
toothbrush to your fuckin' throat, like,

1289
00:49:18,993 --> 00:49:20,659
"Wake up, motherfucker."

1290
00:49:21,712 --> 00:49:24,131
"My brother gets out of the
<i>pinta</i> tomorrow, motherfucker."

1291
00:49:24,165 --> 00:49:26,350
"<i>Vato locos</i> forever, <i>punto.</i>"

1292
00:49:26,384 --> 00:49:28,469
"<i>Simon, ese.</i>"

1293
00:49:28,503 --> 00:49:30,471
You always pull out on a Latina, boys.

1294
00:49:30,505 --> 00:49:31,271
Always.

1295
00:49:31,305 --> 00:49:32,389
You wear a condom and then put a

1296
00:49:32,423 --> 00:49:33,640
Fruit Roll-up on top of that.

1297
00:49:33,674 --> 00:49:35,893
Just to be safe.

1298
00:49:35,927 --> 00:49:36,810
'Cause if you think you're gonna pull out

1299
00:49:36,844 --> 00:49:38,862
and shoot anywhere around her, on her,

1300
00:49:38,896 --> 00:49:41,482
or a warning shot over the port side bow,

1301
00:49:41,516 --> 00:49:46,487
That's a very, very foolish rookie mistake.

1302
00:49:46,521 --> 00:49:47,654
It's like throwing a fucking gallon

1303
00:49:47,688 --> 00:49:48,705
of water on a gremlin.

1304
00:49:48,739 --> 00:49:50,157
Four babies will shoot out of her pussy

1305
00:49:50,191 --> 00:49:52,324
immediately when that shit happens.

1306
00:49:53,361 --> 00:49:55,329
And I don't know if you
white people know this.

1307
00:49:55,363 --> 00:49:57,498
Every Mexican is born
wearing a Raiders jersey.

1308
00:49:57,532 --> 00:49:58,215
I swear to God.

1309
00:49:58,249 --> 00:50:00,083
Fuckin' a.

1310
00:50:00,117 --> 00:50:00,884
Hey, we don't make the rules.

1311
00:50:00,918 --> 00:50:01,668
Jesus does.

1312
00:50:01,702 --> 00:50:02,834
Amen.

1313
00:50:06,707 --> 00:50:08,425
Now before we go,

1314
00:50:08,459 --> 00:50:10,928
we're gonna be standing out
there with Dice and everyone.

1315
00:50:10,962 --> 00:50:12,346
We're gonna be looking at all the grown men

1316
00:50:12,380 --> 00:50:13,430
in this room.

1317
00:50:13,464 --> 00:50:15,182
And if you're wearing
skinny jeans here tonight,

1318
00:50:15,216 --> 00:50:17,568
and your jeans are
tighter than your date's,

1319
00:50:17,602 --> 00:50:19,353
we're gonna kick you in your boy pussy

1320
00:50:19,387 --> 00:50:20,354
right in that fucking ocean

1321
00:50:20,388 --> 00:50:21,438
because that's what you are.

1322
00:50:21,472 --> 00:50:22,606
We're the Smash Brothers.

1323
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:23,740
Thanks for having us.

1324
00:50:23,774 --> 00:50:24,575
Thank you.

1325
00:50:24,609 --> 00:50:25,359
Guys, thanks for having us here.

1326
00:50:25,393 --> 00:50:27,025
Thank you, guys.

1327
00:50:36,070 --> 00:50:38,070
Let's hear it for the Smash Brothers.

1328
00:50:42,159 --> 00:50:42,926
Who's stoked?

1329
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:44,962
I wanna keep this show rolling.

1330
00:50:44,996 --> 00:50:47,965
This next performer, I gotta say,

1331
00:50:47,999 --> 00:50:50,217
to me, this is a long time coming.

1332
00:50:50,251 --> 00:50:54,638
He is absolutely my
brother from another mother.

1333
00:50:54,672 --> 00:50:57,641
He is the other half of my podcast,

1334
00:50:57,675 --> 00:50:59,393
"Rollin' with Dice and Wheels."

1335
00:50:59,427 --> 00:51:02,729
Ladies and gentlemen,
Michael Wheels Parise.

1336
00:51:02,763 --> 00:51:03,979
Bring him out.

1337
00:51:11,989 --> 00:51:13,772
Oh, Jesus fucking...

1338
00:51:16,694 --> 00:51:18,495
Whoo!

1339
00:51:18,529 --> 00:51:18,996
Fuckin' bloated.

1340
00:51:19,030 --> 00:51:19,963
Anybody bloated?

1341
00:51:19,997 --> 00:51:21,415
You know what it is? It's the fucking heat.

1342
00:51:21,449 --> 00:51:22,799
You fucking swell up. Look at this.

1343
00:51:22,833 --> 00:51:24,918
The Chinese food fucks you up.

1344
00:51:24,952 --> 00:51:26,470
They put that MSG, and then you swell up.

1345
00:51:26,504 --> 00:51:27,921
I'm all fuckin' ballooned out tonight.

1346
00:51:27,955 --> 00:51:32,759
I'm normally 140, 145. I fluctuate.

1347
00:51:32,793 --> 00:51:35,178
I'll peak, like, 160 during the holidays,

1348
00:51:35,212 --> 00:51:36,962
but this is fucked up.

1349
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:40,984
I live out in West Hollywood.

1350
00:51:41,018 --> 00:51:43,186
Any West Hollywood people here?

1351
00:51:43,220 --> 00:51:44,104
Yeah, a lot of gay people

1352
00:51:44,138 --> 00:51:45,272
and I have nothing against gay people.

1353
00:51:45,306 --> 00:51:47,074
Very nice, they bend over
backwards for each other,

1354
00:51:47,108 --> 00:51:48,440
but you know what it is?

1355
00:51:49,977 --> 00:51:51,495
Fat guys aren't gay. We don't bend.

1356
00:51:51,529 --> 00:51:52,663
This is about as far as it goes.

1357
00:51:52,697 --> 00:51:54,446
What the fuck can you do with that?

1358
00:51:55,650 --> 00:51:56,667
I don't even bend for change.

1359
00:51:56,701 --> 00:51:58,201
Anything less than 80 cents, fuck it,

1360
00:51:58,235 --> 00:51:59,119
I count it first.

1361
00:51:59,153 --> 00:52:00,819
25, 30...

1362
00:52:05,543 --> 00:52:06,710
Now they have these new ones out.

1363
00:52:06,744 --> 00:52:08,295
They're not gay, they're not bisexual,

1364
00:52:08,329 --> 00:52:09,212
they're bi-curious.

1365
00:52:09,246 --> 00:52:11,214
What the fuck is that?

1366
00:52:11,248 --> 00:52:12,382
"Hey, Frankie, listen. I'm not gay,

1367
00:52:12,416 --> 00:52:13,550
"but real quick, just stick it in.

1368
00:52:13,584 --> 00:52:15,217
"I wanna check this out."

1369
00:52:16,671 --> 00:52:18,221
"Yeah, no, I was reading
about it the other day.

1370
00:52:18,255 --> 00:52:20,390
"I saw it on a billboard.

1371
00:52:20,424 --> 00:52:22,726
"You see that fucking billboard?

1372
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:24,176
"Oh! Ay!"

1373
00:52:25,596 --> 00:52:27,012
"No, I didn't like it."

1374
00:52:30,101 --> 00:52:30,817
"Thank you, though.

1375
00:52:30,851 --> 00:52:32,736
"You're a true fucking friend.

1376
00:52:32,770 --> 00:52:35,687
"A little small, but
a true friend, really."

1377
00:52:37,942 --> 00:52:38,825
I love living out in California.

1378
00:52:38,859 --> 00:52:39,710
All the freeways.

1379
00:52:39,744 --> 00:52:41,161
You got a million fucking freeways.

1380
00:52:41,195 --> 00:52:42,162
And they all go to Long Beach,

1381
00:52:42,196 --> 00:52:44,831
every fucking freeway goes to Long Beach.

1382
00:52:44,865 --> 00:52:45,966
East, west, north, south,

1383
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,417
you're in fucking Long
Beach no matter how you go.

1384
00:52:47,451 --> 00:52:48,835
You ever ask for directions?

1385
00:52:48,869 --> 00:52:51,004
I get, like, a panic attack
asking for fucking directions.

1386
00:52:51,038 --> 00:52:53,340
I'm like, "Excuse me, how
do you get to Pasadena?"

1387
00:52:53,374 --> 00:52:54,673
The guy's like...

1388
00:53:00,381 --> 00:53:03,767
"Uh, where you coming from?"

1389
00:53:03,801 --> 00:53:06,520
"Right here."

1390
00:53:06,554 --> 00:53:07,521
"All right."

1391
00:53:07,555 --> 00:53:09,606
"You wanna make a right
and then you wanna go,

1392
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:11,908
"like... keep going.

1393
00:53:11,942 --> 00:53:13,276
"You wanna get on the 101.

1394
00:53:13,310 --> 00:53:14,444
"Take the 101 to the 110

1395
00:53:14,478 --> 00:53:17,748
"to the 184 to the 136 to the 5 to the 405,

1396
00:53:17,782 --> 00:53:18,915
"get off,

1397
00:53:18,949 --> 00:53:21,233
"get on..."

1398
00:53:22,403 --> 00:53:23,954
"to the 10.

1399
00:53:23,988 --> 00:53:25,122
"Keep going and going and going

1400
00:53:25,156 --> 00:53:28,709
"until you run into a
fucking wall head-on."

1401
00:53:28,743 --> 00:53:29,710
"It's gonna say 'Long Beach'

1402
00:53:29,744 --> 00:53:32,212
"right there in front of your face."

1403
00:53:32,246 --> 00:53:33,880
"No, I said Pasadena."

1404
00:53:33,914 --> 00:53:35,880
"Oh, I don't know."

1405
00:53:37,134 --> 00:53:37,884
"I don't think you can get there from

1406
00:53:37,918 --> 00:53:40,554
"where you're at."

1407
00:53:40,588 --> 00:53:41,772
I was out in Mexico a couple of weeks ago.

1408
00:53:41,806 --> 00:53:43,471
Anybody go out to Mexico
for the day, just hang out?

1409
00:53:44,675 --> 00:53:45,726
You can buy fucking anything.

1410
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:47,561
They'll sell you fucking
anything in Mexico.

1411
00:53:47,595 --> 00:53:48,478
There is shit all over the streets

1412
00:53:48,512 --> 00:53:50,614
like one big garage sale.

1413
00:53:50,648 --> 00:53:51,898
And Mexicans can sell.

1414
00:53:51,932 --> 00:53:53,598
I bought a fuckin' toaster.

1415
00:53:55,102 --> 00:53:56,818
With no fuckin' cord.

1416
00:53:59,490 --> 00:54:00,907
And I knew there was no fucking cord.

1417
00:54:00,941 --> 00:54:02,576
And he convinced me.

1418
00:54:02,610 --> 00:54:03,627
He's like, "No, no, it's cool, bro.

1419
00:54:03,661 --> 00:54:05,777
"It's fucky... it's fucky..."

1420
00:54:08,616 --> 00:54:11,283
"It's fucking wireless, bro."

1421
00:54:12,453 --> 00:54:14,137
"It's got the bluetooth,

1422
00:54:14,171 --> 00:54:15,787
"the fucking bluetooth."

1423
00:54:16,841 --> 00:54:18,308
"Fucky...

1424
00:54:18,342 --> 00:54:20,592
"iToaster, fucker."

1425
00:54:22,012 --> 00:54:23,597
They always take you down the back alley,

1426
00:54:23,631 --> 00:54:24,598
down some street.

1427
00:54:24,632 --> 00:54:25,432
You don't know what the fuck you're buying.

1428
00:54:25,466 --> 00:54:26,433
They never look at you in the eye.

1429
00:54:26,467 --> 00:54:27,934
It's like, "Yo, check it out. Check it out.

1430
00:54:27,968 --> 00:54:29,319
"Bro, over here. Bro.

1431
00:54:29,353 --> 00:54:31,938
"Fucking leather jacket, bro.

1432
00:54:31,972 --> 00:54:35,442
"Leather fucking jacket."

1433
00:54:35,476 --> 00:54:36,943
"How much?"

1434
00:54:36,977 --> 00:54:39,196
"Fuckin' 800 bucks, dude.

1435
00:54:39,230 --> 00:54:41,780
"But for you, five dollar, bro."

1436
00:54:43,317 --> 00:54:46,119
"That's, like, a 795 dollar savings."

1437
00:54:46,153 --> 00:54:47,454
"Oh, fuck yeah, bro.

1438
00:54:47,488 --> 00:54:50,457
"Fucking Five Dollar Tuesday, God damn it."

1439
00:54:50,491 --> 00:54:51,458
"What kind of leather is it?"

1440
00:54:51,492 --> 00:54:52,626
"Fucking five dollars, bro!

1441
00:54:52,660 --> 00:54:53,627
"What the fuck you want?!

1442
00:54:53,661 --> 00:54:56,463
"Fucking monkey or something. Fuck it.

1443
00:54:56,497 --> 00:54:58,630
"Black lab or something."

1444
00:55:00,551 --> 00:55:01,468
Then you buy it and take it home

1445
00:55:01,502 --> 00:55:02,219
and it wakes up in the car.

1446
00:55:02,253 --> 00:55:04,054
It's fucking black lab.

1447
00:55:04,088 --> 00:55:05,889
I bought an exhausted fucking dog.

1448
00:55:05,923 --> 00:55:07,172
Who knew?

1449
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:10,977
You gotta be happy where
you are in life, man.

1450
00:55:11,011 --> 00:55:12,813
Whether you're short,
tall, fat, bald, thin,

1451
00:55:12,847 --> 00:55:14,312
be happy, right?

1452
00:55:17,268 --> 00:55:18,819
A lot of people are in
denial about themselves.

1453
00:55:18,853 --> 00:55:20,403
Fat people don't wanna admit they're fat.

1454
00:55:20,437 --> 00:55:22,322
How don't you admit you're fucking fat?

1455
00:55:22,356 --> 00:55:23,707
You walk out of your house,

1456
00:55:23,741 --> 00:55:25,325
everybody knows you're fat.

1457
00:55:25,359 --> 00:55:26,576
You can't hide it.

1458
00:55:26,610 --> 00:55:27,661
They try to cover it up.

1459
00:55:27,695 --> 00:55:29,329
They wear, like, all black.

1460
00:55:29,363 --> 00:55:30,914
"Hey, how do I look?"

1461
00:55:30,948 --> 00:55:33,917
"You look fat in black.
That's how you look."

1462
00:55:33,951 --> 00:55:36,386
"You look the same as
you do in canary yellow,

1463
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:37,752
"same shit."

1464
00:55:39,039 --> 00:55:40,173
They got every excuse.

1465
00:55:40,207 --> 00:55:41,341
"Oh, I don't know why I'm fat.

1466
00:55:41,375 --> 00:55:44,060
"I don't even eat."

1467
00:55:44,094 --> 00:55:46,513
"Really?

1468
00:55:46,547 --> 00:55:48,265
"Wow, that's fucked up because

1469
00:55:48,299 --> 00:55:50,382
"you're fuckin' fat."

1470
00:55:51,936 --> 00:55:53,019
"I mean, imagine if you
ate what you'd look like.

1471
00:55:53,053 --> 00:55:55,572
"Holy shit."

1472
00:55:55,606 --> 00:55:56,857
"What do you do? You run too much?

1473
00:55:56,891 --> 00:55:58,859
"Is that your problem?"

1474
00:55:58,893 --> 00:55:59,910
"What, do you sweat the pounds on?

1475
00:55:59,944 --> 00:56:01,695
"What the fuck you doing?"

1476
00:56:01,729 --> 00:56:04,247
"Well, I retain water."

1477
00:56:04,281 --> 00:56:07,732
"No, you retain cake.
That's your fucking problem."

1478
00:56:09,820 --> 00:56:11,872
"You're 700 pounds. What, are you Aquaman?

1479
00:56:11,906 --> 00:56:14,040
"What kind of fuckin' water do you retain?"

1480
00:56:14,074 --> 00:56:16,293
"What, do you retain a lake?"

1481
00:56:16,327 --> 00:56:17,377
"Well, I have an eating disorder."

1482
00:56:17,411 --> 00:56:19,379
"Yeah, dis order of
cake, dis order of fries,

1483
00:56:19,413 --> 00:56:22,432
"dis order of fucking ice cream."

1484
00:56:22,466 --> 00:56:25,101
"Try a prune. Take a shit once in a while.

1485
00:56:25,135 --> 00:56:26,970
"You're all backed up."

1486
00:56:27,004 --> 00:56:28,104
"Your fucking ass is clogged.

1487
00:56:28,138 --> 00:56:29,472
"That's your problem.

1488
00:56:29,506 --> 00:56:31,725
"A little fruit and fiber in
the morning ain't gonna hurt.

1489
00:56:31,759 --> 00:56:33,393
"You know, some fucking steel-cut oats.

1490
00:56:33,427 --> 00:56:34,726
"Help yourself."

1491
00:56:35,763 --> 00:56:38,398
I'm a little bit different
than most fat guys.

1492
00:56:38,432 --> 00:56:40,317
I happen to be extremely
handsome for my width.

1493
00:56:40,351 --> 00:56:42,402
You don't see that.

1494
00:56:42,436 --> 00:56:43,987
A lot of fat guys are fuckin' ugly.

1495
00:56:44,021 --> 00:56:45,987
They got that fucked up face.

1496
00:56:47,491 --> 00:56:49,075
Shit, walk into a restaurant,

1497
00:56:49,109 --> 00:56:50,911
"Hey, I need a table for five.

1498
00:56:50,945 --> 00:56:52,829
"I'm alone. Ha ha.

1499
00:56:52,863 --> 00:56:53,997
"I don't want no booth.

1500
00:56:54,031 --> 00:56:56,166
"No fuckin' booth."

1501
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:57,417
We fuckin' hate booths.

1502
00:56:57,451 --> 00:56:58,635
We gotta squeeze in.

1503
00:56:58,669 --> 00:57:02,255
We got one leg in, your
fuckin' ass gotta shuffle.

1504
00:57:02,289 --> 00:57:03,590
Fuckin' belly's hanging
on top of the booth.

1505
00:57:03,624 --> 00:57:05,308
Every time you breathe, the
other guy's like, "Whoa."

1506
00:57:05,342 --> 00:57:06,624
I'm like, "I'm sorry."

1507
00:57:07,795 --> 00:57:10,480
I'm trying to date. I was
on this one dating site, man.

1508
00:57:10,514 --> 00:57:13,650
I was on fatchat.com.
Anybody been on there?

1509
00:57:13,684 --> 00:57:15,235
I don't like regular fat girls,

1510
00:57:15,269 --> 00:57:16,236
I like them immobile.

1511
00:57:16,270 --> 00:57:18,021
I don't like them walking. That's my thing.

1512
00:57:18,055 --> 00:57:19,489
I wanna see them pull up to my house

1513
00:57:19,523 --> 00:57:21,441
in a Walmart scooter with that [whirring]

1514
00:57:21,475 --> 00:57:24,110
basket full of fucking chips.

1515
00:57:24,144 --> 00:57:26,162
I'm talking to this one girl,

1516
00:57:26,196 --> 00:57:27,664
she tells me she's 600 pounds.

1517
00:57:27,698 --> 00:57:29,147
I'm like, "Fuckin' perfect."

1518
00:57:30,401 --> 00:57:31,618
So, I'm typing to her, we're typing.

1519
00:57:31,652 --> 00:57:32,786
You know, I'm asking her her name,

1520
00:57:32,820 --> 00:57:34,037
"What's your name," all this bullshit.

1521
00:57:34,071 --> 00:57:35,672
I'm like, "Oh, what color are your eyes?"

1522
00:57:35,706 --> 00:57:38,323
She's like, "Gravy
brown." I'm like, "Nice."

1523
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:44,965
She tells me she's 600 pounds,

1524
00:57:44,999 --> 00:57:45,966
I'm like, "Fuckin' perfect."

1525
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:46,850
She goes, "Do you wanna meet?"

1526
00:57:46,884 --> 00:57:48,635
I'm like, "Yeah, I'll meet," you know?

1527
00:57:48,669 --> 00:57:49,886
I'm like, "What do you weigh?
Can I ask you one more time,

1528
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:51,054
"what do you weigh?"

1529
00:57:51,088 --> 00:57:51,805
She goes, "600 pounds." I
go, "Fuck it, let's meet,"

1530
00:57:51,839 --> 00:57:52,889
right?

1531
00:57:52,923 --> 00:57:53,807
We meet two days later,

1532
00:57:53,841 --> 00:57:56,140
800 fucking pounds.

1533
00:57:57,261 --> 00:57:59,646
Fuckin' liar! What a line.

1534
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:02,899
Her belly button had an echo.

1535
00:58:02,933 --> 00:58:03,817
When she farted,

1536
00:58:03,851 --> 00:58:06,236
the Weather Channel talked about it.

1537
00:58:06,270 --> 00:58:07,237
I took her home, I was fucking her,

1538
00:58:07,271 --> 00:58:08,655
I cut my ass on the ceiling fan.

1539
00:58:08,689 --> 00:58:10,991
That ever happen to anybody?

1540
00:58:11,025 --> 00:58:13,493
I'm like, "Yeah, pow, pow! Pow, pow!

1541
00:58:13,527 --> 00:58:14,878
"Get on the fucking floor!

1542
00:58:14,912 --> 00:58:16,694
<i>"Pow! On the fucking floor!"</i>

1543
00:58:18,415 --> 00:58:20,050
I mean, how do you lie like that?

1544
00:58:20,084 --> 00:58:22,335
You tell me you're
fucking 600, show up 600.

1545
00:58:22,369 --> 00:58:23,868
Don't bullshit.

1546
00:58:25,089 --> 00:58:26,556
I'm not gonna go out with...

1547
00:58:26,590 --> 00:58:28,425
Eight-hundred, that's obese.

1548
00:58:28,459 --> 00:58:29,874
Come on.

1549
00:58:31,795 --> 00:58:34,564
Then she tells me, "Oh, I'm into bondage."

1550
00:58:34,598 --> 00:58:37,233
Wanted me to tie her up.

1551
00:58:37,267 --> 00:58:39,019
Yeah, seven fucking hours I'm trying

1552
00:58:39,053 --> 00:58:41,438
to tie this girl up.

1553
00:58:41,472 --> 00:58:43,857
Fuckin' tying and tying and tying...

1554
00:58:43,891 --> 00:58:45,075
I ran out of rope.

1555
00:58:45,109 --> 00:58:48,445
I had to use kite string and fuckin' twine.

1556
00:58:48,479 --> 00:58:49,362
When I was done, she looked like

1557
00:58:49,396 --> 00:58:51,865
a fucking roast beef laying in my bed.

1558
00:58:51,899 --> 00:58:53,116
You've been a great crowd. I'm Wheels.

1559
00:58:53,150 --> 00:58:54,949
Thank you, everybody.

1560
00:59:03,494 --> 00:59:05,577
Michael Wheels Parise.

1561
00:59:07,664 --> 00:59:09,132
You're a great crowd, really.

1562
00:59:09,166 --> 00:59:10,467
We're gonna keep things moving along.

1563
00:59:10,501 --> 00:59:12,385
You know, one of the great things about

1564
00:59:12,419 --> 00:59:15,805
hosting this show is in 1988,

1565
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:17,774
Rodney Dangerfield put me

1566
00:59:17,808 --> 00:59:20,475
on his HBO special.

1567
00:59:22,513 --> 00:59:23,897
And so, it's nice to be the guy

1568
00:59:23,931 --> 00:59:26,232
bringing up new people
and I had to find people

1569
00:59:26,266 --> 00:59:29,652
from all over the country
that would fit this bill.

1570
00:59:29,686 --> 00:59:32,789
And I have my own New York guy right here.

1571
00:59:32,823 --> 00:59:37,327
He is definitely the Don
Juan of stand-up comedy.

1572
00:59:37,361 --> 00:59:40,330
From New York City, Colin Kane.

1573
00:59:40,364 --> 00:59:42,246
Give it up. Colin.

1574
00:59:49,289 --> 00:59:51,674
Come on, come on.

1575
00:59:51,708 --> 00:59:54,144
Whaddup, Showtime? Make some noise.

1576
00:59:54,178 --> 00:59:55,345
Come on, make some noise.

1577
00:59:55,379 --> 00:59:57,428
Come on, come on, a little more.

1578
00:59:59,183 --> 01:00:00,316
Put it there, guy. Put it there.

1579
01:00:00,350 --> 01:00:01,851
Go fuck yourself, go fuck yourself.

1580
01:00:01,885 --> 01:00:03,820
Sit down.

1581
01:00:03,854 --> 01:00:05,939
Fuckin' Indian right up
front, huh? Holy shit.

1582
01:00:05,973 --> 01:00:08,272
Was a server down tonight? Jesus Christ.

1583
01:00:12,646 --> 01:00:13,663
You ever go down on a girl, fellas,

1584
01:00:13,697 --> 01:00:15,198
and her pussy smells so bad you opt to

1585
01:00:15,232 --> 01:00:16,948
eat her ass instead?

1586
01:00:21,872 --> 01:00:23,206
If you're not laughing right now,

1587
01:00:23,240 --> 01:00:25,823
this is gonna be a long
ten minutes, motherfuckers.

1588
01:00:27,244 --> 01:00:30,296
You gotta loosen the fuck up, seriously.

1589
01:00:30,330 --> 01:00:32,048
You ever eat a girl's ass

1590
01:00:32,082 --> 01:00:33,133
and she's not into it?

1591
01:00:33,167 --> 01:00:35,051
If you eat a girl's ass
and she's not into it,

1592
01:00:35,085 --> 01:00:38,002
it's gonna get uncomfortable
in the room for a little while.

1593
01:00:40,257 --> 01:00:42,692
Some of you ladies wanna
laugh, but you're holding it in.

1594
01:00:42,726 --> 01:00:43,977
You know what's gonna
happen when you hold it in?

1595
01:00:44,011 --> 01:00:45,028
You know what's gonna happen?

1596
01:00:45,062 --> 01:00:46,062
You're gonna get all that air in your pussy

1597
01:00:46,096 --> 01:00:48,179
and it's gonna get a
little bloated tonight.

1598
01:00:50,100 --> 01:00:51,985
You're gonna bend down to
fuck your husband, you know...

1599
01:00:52,019 --> 01:00:53,518
fut, fut, fut, fut...

1600
01:00:55,405 --> 01:00:57,021
Fut, fut, fut.

1601
01:00:58,192 --> 01:00:59,375
"What was that?"

1602
01:00:59,409 --> 01:01:02,412
"I think the comforter got
caught underneath the bed."

1603
01:01:02,446 --> 01:01:04,414
"No, I think your pussy
looked at me and said,

1604
01:01:04,448 --> 01:01:06,080
'Hey, fut, fut, fut.'"

1605
01:01:08,869 --> 01:01:09,669
You gotta do dirty shit.

1606
01:01:09,703 --> 01:01:11,171
Ladies, guys respect girls who

1607
01:01:11,205 --> 01:01:12,338
disrespect themselves in the bedroom.

1608
01:01:12,372 --> 01:01:13,173
You gotta do dirty shit,

1609
01:01:13,207 --> 01:01:14,057
you gotta talk dirty.

1610
01:01:14,091 --> 01:01:14,891
When you talk dirty,

1611
01:01:14,925 --> 01:01:16,009
you gotta change it up.

1612
01:01:16,043 --> 01:01:18,595
You gotta say dirty shit.

1613
01:01:18,629 --> 01:01:19,596
A lot of you... Shut up.

1614
01:01:19,630 --> 01:01:20,511
A lot of you white girls...

1615
01:01:22,132 --> 01:01:23,933
A lot of you white
girls say the same thing.

1616
01:01:23,967 --> 01:01:25,401
You'll be like, "I wanna taste you."

1617
01:01:25,435 --> 01:01:27,187
You gotta, like, change it up.

1618
01:01:27,221 --> 01:01:28,354
Just look at your man tonight and say,

1619
01:01:28,388 --> 01:01:31,105
"Baby, storm my shit cave."

1620
01:01:34,895 --> 01:01:35,862
<i>Whoo!</i>

1621
01:01:35,896 --> 01:01:37,413
And we all... Guys, we all,

1622
01:01:37,447 --> 01:01:38,531
every single guy in here,

1623
01:01:38,565 --> 01:01:39,365
we have a feeler question when

1624
01:01:39,399 --> 01:01:40,366
we're hooking up with a chick

1625
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:41,451
'cause you don't wanna be too weird.

1626
01:01:41,485 --> 01:01:42,869
You have a feeler question, you know?

1627
01:01:42,903 --> 01:01:43,870
You'll be having sex and be like,

1628
01:01:43,904 --> 01:01:44,871
"Yeah, you fuckin' like that?

1629
01:01:44,905 --> 01:01:46,372
"You fuckin' like that?"

1630
01:01:46,406 --> 01:01:47,757
I said that to a girl one time.

1631
01:01:47,791 --> 01:01:48,791
I said, "Do you fuckin' like that?"

1632
01:01:48,825 --> 01:01:49,792
She looks at me and says,

1633
01:01:49,826 --> 01:01:51,576
"Pound my pussy, faggot."

1634
01:01:57,501 --> 01:01:58,885
I didn't know what to do.

1635
01:01:58,919 --> 01:02:01,252
I was like, "Um, I'm
gonna key your car, bitch."

1636
01:02:04,258 --> 01:02:05,608
I love you, ladies. All
you ladies are beautiful.

1637
01:02:05,642 --> 01:02:07,227
But you ladies know... Listen, ladies,

1638
01:02:07,261 --> 01:02:08,278
I'm gonna ask you a serious question.

1639
01:02:08,312 --> 01:02:09,062
You ever sit at work,

1640
01:02:09,096 --> 01:02:10,446
just sitting there

1641
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:12,480
and you can actually smell
your pussy through your pants?

1642
01:02:21,942 --> 01:02:22,742
And then, some of you ladies

1643
01:02:22,776 --> 01:02:23,793
do the little fucking sniff test.

1644
01:02:23,827 --> 01:02:24,961
You'll sit there, you'll sit there

1645
01:02:24,995 --> 01:02:25,912
and do the sniff test.

1646
01:02:25,946 --> 01:02:28,498
Shh. Don't fuckin'... Shut the fuck up.

1647
01:02:28,532 --> 01:02:30,917
You ladies do this shit.

1648
01:02:30,951 --> 01:02:31,968
You'll stick your finger down there,

1649
01:02:32,002 --> 01:02:32,919
do the ol' sniff test

1650
01:02:32,953 --> 01:02:33,970
and then pull it out and be like,

1651
01:02:34,004 --> 01:02:35,471
"Does the fax machine work?

1652
01:02:35,505 --> 01:02:37,088
"Is the fax machine working?"

1653
01:02:38,458 --> 01:02:39,976
I went down on this girl one time.

1654
01:02:40,010 --> 01:02:41,594
Honestly, her pussy smelled so bad,

1655
01:02:41,628 --> 01:02:42,929
halfway through, I got up in the middle

1656
01:02:42,963 --> 01:02:44,097
and took a shit on the floor

1657
01:02:44,131 --> 01:02:45,630
to neutralize the smell.

1658
01:02:48,852 --> 01:02:49,936
And if you're not laughing right now,

1659
01:02:49,970 --> 01:02:50,987
we know why, ladies.

1660
01:02:51,021 --> 01:02:52,655
We know why.

1661
01:02:52,689 --> 01:02:54,774
You got a little garbage juice down there.

1662
01:02:54,808 --> 01:02:56,307
Ahh!

1663
01:03:02,149 --> 01:03:03,249
I like having sex with Asian girls.

1664
01:03:03,283 --> 01:03:05,952
Where my Asian girls at?
You in the room tonight?

1665
01:03:05,986 --> 01:03:07,086
No?

1666
01:03:07,120 --> 01:03:08,371
Where are you, selling
baby turtles on eBay?

1667
01:03:08,405 --> 01:03:10,873
Where are you people?

1668
01:03:10,907 --> 01:03:11,841
Asian right up front

1669
01:03:11,875 --> 01:03:13,624
like your whole fucking life in school.

1670
01:03:16,330 --> 01:03:18,431
Asian girls are so quiet in bed.

1671
01:03:18,465 --> 01:03:19,349
You ever have sex with an Asian girl?

1672
01:03:19,383 --> 01:03:20,683
It feels like you're fuckin' a Prius,

1673
01:03:20,717 --> 01:03:21,999
an electric car.

1674
01:03:32,596 --> 01:03:33,980
You ever see an Asian girl when she cums?

1675
01:03:34,014 --> 01:03:35,148
Looks like a white dude right before

1676
01:03:35,182 --> 01:03:36,199
he's about to sneeze.

1677
01:03:36,233 --> 01:03:39,183
Ha-ha-ha-ha.

1678
01:03:41,321 --> 01:03:43,740
Look at the white people.
You don't wanna laugh.

1679
01:03:43,774 --> 01:03:45,907
Fuckin' lighten up, assholes.

1680
01:03:47,027 --> 01:03:48,711
That black dude yelled
at you for 20 minutes.

1681
01:03:48,745 --> 01:03:50,747
You fuckin' laughed.

1682
01:03:50,781 --> 01:03:54,167
I love black people. Any
black girls here tonight?

1683
01:03:54,201 --> 01:03:55,833
No? Okay.

1684
01:03:57,037 --> 01:03:58,671
I wanna be with the real black girl.

1685
01:03:58,705 --> 01:03:59,756
I see a black girl right there.

1686
01:03:59,790 --> 01:04:01,090
Don't hide, baby. I see you right there.

1687
01:04:01,124 --> 01:04:02,925
I wanna be with a real black girl,

1688
01:04:02,959 --> 01:04:05,511
works at CVS, angry as fuck.

1689
01:04:05,545 --> 01:04:07,628
That's what I'm talking about.

1690
01:04:08,715 --> 01:04:09,766
If you're not laughing right now,

1691
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:11,934
honestly, get up, go home.

1692
01:04:11,968 --> 01:04:13,885
Just fuckin' leave right now.

1693
01:04:15,222 --> 01:04:17,357
Black girl's staring at me like this,

1694
01:04:17,391 --> 01:04:19,023
"Hmmm."

1695
01:04:20,777 --> 01:04:21,778
You been with a white guy, black girl?

1696
01:04:21,812 --> 01:04:23,029
Be honest. You been with a white guy?

1697
01:04:23,063 --> 01:04:23,696
Don't be shy, baby.

1698
01:04:23,730 --> 01:04:25,081
Been with a white guy?

1699
01:04:25,115 --> 01:04:26,249
Be honest.

1700
01:04:26,283 --> 01:04:28,368
First time a black girl has nothing to say.

1701
01:04:28,402 --> 01:04:29,617
You hear that shit?

1702
01:04:31,121 --> 01:04:34,290
Smile, baby, I love you. I love you.

1703
01:04:34,324 --> 01:04:35,541
<i>I love you, baby.</i>

1704
01:04:35,575 --> 01:04:37,877
This is the best sound when you're getting

1705
01:04:37,911 --> 01:04:38,761
a blow job right here.

1706
01:04:38,795 --> 01:04:39,545
The best sound ever.

1707
01:04:39,579 --> 01:04:40,546
Ready?

1708
01:04:40,580 --> 01:04:41,879
Best sound ever.

1709
01:04:51,508 --> 01:04:52,475
A good blow job should sound like

1710
01:04:52,509 --> 01:04:54,892
every conversation at a bar mitzvah.

1711
01:04:57,431 --> 01:04:58,781
And if you're a girl and
you're not laughing right now,

1712
01:04:58,815 --> 01:05:01,732
you got a hairy asshole.
Go wait in the car, bitch.

1713
01:05:02,769 --> 01:05:04,070
Laugh a little, ladies.

1714
01:05:04,104 --> 01:05:05,653
Laugh.

1715
01:05:07,607 --> 01:05:08,958
You ladies gotta take it in the ass.

1716
01:05:08,992 --> 01:05:09,742
I know it hurts,

1717
01:05:09,776 --> 01:05:10,743
but it's gonna hurt a lot more

1718
01:05:10,777 --> 01:05:12,777
when we leave you for not letting us do it.

1719
01:05:14,781 --> 01:05:15,915
<i>You gotta do dirty stuff. You gotta.</i>

1720
01:05:15,949 --> 01:05:18,334
And, fellas, too, man, I gotta say this,

1721
01:05:18,368 --> 01:05:19,419
fellas, you ever just sit in bed

1722
01:05:19,453 --> 01:05:21,754
you're, like, depressed, and you're like,

1723
01:05:21,788 --> 01:05:24,140
"I'm just gonna jerk off
'cause I feel depressed,"

1724
01:05:24,174 --> 01:05:26,476
then you jerk your dick and
even your cum's depressed.

1725
01:05:26,510 --> 01:05:28,426
It just bubbles out like [bubbling sound].

1726
01:05:32,182 --> 01:05:34,434
You ever look at porn, like,
20 windows deep, fellas?

1727
01:05:34,468 --> 01:05:37,186
Twenty windows deep?

1728
01:05:37,220 --> 01:05:38,271
And sometimes, you cum on yourself

1729
01:05:38,305 --> 01:05:39,355
and you're too lazy to get up,

1730
01:05:39,389 --> 01:05:40,606
so you let it roll down your ribcage

1731
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:42,024
and you just sit there.

1732
01:05:42,058 --> 01:05:43,693
Don't you dare make me
feel uncomfortable tonight.

1733
01:05:43,727 --> 01:05:45,828
You guys totally do this.

1734
01:05:45,862 --> 01:05:48,448
Don't you dare.

1735
01:05:48,482 --> 01:05:50,783
You're just sitting there
letting it roll down you.

1736
01:05:50,817 --> 01:05:52,201
You gotta, like, turn your body this way,

1737
01:05:52,235 --> 01:05:53,503
turn your body that way.

1738
01:05:53,537 --> 01:05:55,204
It's like that game as a
kid with the metal ball.

1739
01:05:55,238 --> 01:05:56,954
You just gotta get it home.

1740
01:05:59,493 --> 01:06:00,626
You know what I'm talking about.

1741
01:06:00,660 --> 01:06:01,344
The lady up front's dying.

1742
01:06:01,378 --> 01:06:02,128
I love you, baby.

1743
01:06:02,162 --> 01:06:03,129
Yes, I love you.

1744
01:06:03,163 --> 01:06:04,464
Give me your hand, touch it.

1745
01:06:04,498 --> 01:06:06,297
Touch it, touch it. Touch it!

1746
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:12,054
See, you're the best
type of girl right there.

1747
01:06:12,088 --> 01:06:13,556
See, you're fuckin' laughing and shit.

1748
01:06:13,590 --> 01:06:14,557
There's some fat girls in the back

1749
01:06:14,591 --> 01:06:15,890
probably spotting.

1750
01:06:22,349 --> 01:06:23,566
You gotta laugh at yourself.

1751
01:06:23,600 --> 01:06:25,151
This fat girl came up to me
after my show, true story.

1752
01:06:25,185 --> 01:06:26,035
She came up to me after the show

1753
01:06:26,069 --> 01:06:28,488
and she goes, "Those jokes hurt."

1754
01:06:28,522 --> 01:06:29,372
I go,

1755
01:06:29,406 --> 01:06:31,541
"So did my legs on the way to Vegas

1756
01:06:31,575 --> 01:06:33,657
"when I couldn't put my seat back."

1757
01:06:42,369 --> 01:06:44,668
I'm not leaving. I'm staying
here all night, motherfuckers.

1758
01:06:52,546 --> 01:06:54,013
By the way, Dice is fuckin' the man.

1759
01:06:54,047 --> 01:06:56,430
Another round for Dice
because he's the fuckin' man.

1760
01:07:00,554 --> 01:07:02,522
Listen, I make fun of everybody

1761
01:07:02,556 --> 01:07:04,190
and I talk about sex sometimes,

1762
01:07:04,224 --> 01:07:05,241
but I'm not that good in bed

1763
01:07:05,275 --> 01:07:07,026
and everyone's been in this situation.

1764
01:07:07,060 --> 01:07:07,910
You ever been with a girl and she's like,

1765
01:07:07,944 --> 01:07:08,911
"Fuck me harder," and you're like,

1766
01:07:08,945 --> 01:07:10,446
"All right," boom, hit it a little harder?

1767
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:12,865
She's like, "Harder," and you're like,

1768
01:07:12,899 --> 01:07:14,448
"This is all I got."

1769
01:07:19,322 --> 01:07:23,259
"Bitch, this is all I got."

1770
01:07:23,293 --> 01:07:25,294
Just trying really, really hard.

1771
01:07:25,328 --> 01:07:26,712
Now listen, I had a girl one time...

1772
01:07:26,746 --> 01:07:27,547
this is a true story...

1773
01:07:27,581 --> 01:07:29,048
I had a girl one time stick a finger

1774
01:07:29,082 --> 01:07:30,433
in my ass during a blow job.

1775
01:07:30,467 --> 01:07:32,051
Now, some of you guys are like,

1776
01:07:32,085 --> 01:07:33,219
"Fucking faggot."

1777
01:07:33,253 --> 01:07:35,219
Well, this fuckin' faggot loved it.

1778
01:07:38,642 --> 01:07:39,642
Now, she didn't tell me she was gonna

1779
01:07:39,676 --> 01:07:40,476
stick a finger in my ass.

1780
01:07:40,510 --> 01:07:42,562
It just kinda happened.

1781
01:07:42,596 --> 01:07:43,479
She put it in there.

1782
01:07:43,513 --> 01:07:44,697
Put it this way, when she took it out,

1783
01:07:44,731 --> 01:07:46,764
it looked like we just
finished Tough Mudder.

1784
01:07:50,654 --> 01:07:52,071
The only way I can describe
what it looked like:

1785
01:07:52,105 --> 01:07:53,990
You ever buy, like, a
tub of chocolate protein,

1786
01:07:54,024 --> 01:07:55,458
you can't find the
scoop for a little while?

1787
01:07:55,492 --> 01:07:57,108
You gotta search for it?

1788
01:07:59,613 --> 01:08:01,247
Some of you guys know what's up.

1789
01:08:01,281 --> 01:08:03,781
Don't you dare make me feel uncomfortable.

1790
01:08:05,168 --> 01:08:06,252
Stuck it right in there.

1791
01:08:06,286 --> 01:08:07,503
And the only way I can
describe what it felt like:

1792
01:08:07,537 --> 01:08:10,306
Picture someone breaking in your house.

1793
01:08:10,340 --> 01:08:12,091
Then you go downstairs
thinking you're gonna die

1794
01:08:12,125 --> 01:08:14,343
and it's a hot chick with,
like, oatmeal cookies, like

1795
01:08:14,377 --> 01:08:16,093
"You want some?"

1796
01:08:23,720 --> 01:08:25,438
If I made you forget
about your problems tonight

1797
01:08:25,472 --> 01:08:26,606
for a little while, then I did my job.

1798
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:28,941
I'm grateful to be here.
Keep laughing, everybody.

1799
01:08:28,975 --> 01:08:30,641
Keep laughing. Thank you.

1800
01:08:38,151 --> 01:08:39,650
Colin Kane.

1801
01:08:41,821 --> 01:08:44,040
I just can't believe

1802
01:08:44,074 --> 01:08:45,958
that I look at fat girls

1803
01:08:45,992 --> 01:08:49,128
and you get insulted at yourselves.

1804
01:08:49,162 --> 01:08:51,128
What is wrong with you?

1805
01:08:52,499 --> 01:08:53,849
The beefier, the better.

1806
01:08:53,883 --> 01:08:56,302
I mean, that's how I like them.

1807
01:08:56,336 --> 01:08:57,353
You know, I don't know about you,

1808
01:08:57,387 --> 01:09:00,022
but I get them off of Jenny Craig's list.

1809
01:09:00,056 --> 01:09:02,308
They're unbelievable.

1810
01:09:02,342 --> 01:09:03,476
And I'll tell you the truth.

1811
01:09:03,510 --> 01:09:04,977
I don't care how big a chick is.

1812
01:09:05,011 --> 01:09:07,229
After a while, they're all the same.

1813
01:09:07,263 --> 01:09:10,483
"Eat my pussy."

1814
01:09:10,517 --> 01:09:11,317
"Eat your pussy?

1815
01:09:11,351 --> 01:09:12,151
"You're 500 pounds.

1816
01:09:12,185 --> 01:09:13,684
"That's all you keep in the house?"

1817
01:09:15,405 --> 01:09:16,405
"What do you mean, eat your pussy?"

1818
01:09:16,439 --> 01:09:19,492
And no matter how you
prepare you box today,

1819
01:09:19,526 --> 01:09:22,712
no matter what you spray
on it to disinfect it,

1820
01:09:22,746 --> 01:09:25,214
Lysol, D40,

1821
01:09:25,248 --> 01:09:26,864
Off...

1822
01:09:28,702 --> 01:09:29,585
by the time we get there,

1823
01:09:29,619 --> 01:09:30,920
it smells like a foot

1824
01:09:30,954 --> 01:09:34,507
that's been in a shoe for 12 hours.

1825
01:09:34,541 --> 01:09:35,758
"Eat my fuckin' pussy."

1826
01:09:35,792 --> 01:09:37,009
And today, Joey,

1827
01:09:37,043 --> 01:09:39,428
they shave it down to street-level.

1828
01:09:39,462 --> 01:09:41,931
It's like going down on cactus,

1829
01:09:41,965 --> 01:09:43,015
I'm telling ya.

1830
01:09:43,049 --> 01:09:45,518
Remember when you could
come up with enough hair

1831
01:09:45,552 --> 01:09:48,018
in your mouth to make a bird's nest?

1832
01:09:49,055 --> 01:09:51,157
I would go to the dentist for a cleaning,

1833
01:09:51,191 --> 01:09:52,575
they'd have to comb it,

1834
01:09:52,609 --> 01:09:55,911
trim it down with a
special fuckin' Norelco.

1835
01:09:55,945 --> 01:09:57,913
Real pussy hair.

1836
01:09:57,947 --> 01:10:01,448
The type you're flossing
with three days later.

1837
01:10:04,070 --> 01:10:06,922
Comin' to the stage,

1838
01:10:06,956 --> 01:10:09,208
from Canada,

1839
01:10:09,242 --> 01:10:12,878
the terminator of comedy
from what I could see.

1840
01:10:12,912 --> 01:10:15,548
He's been acquitted of all charges.

1841
01:10:15,582 --> 01:10:16,716
Ladies and gentlemen,

1842
01:10:16,750 --> 01:10:18,465
Jason Rouse.

1843
01:10:24,591 --> 01:10:27,777
What the fuck's going on?!

1844
01:10:27,811 --> 01:10:30,980
How the fuck are you?

1845
01:10:31,014 --> 01:10:32,898
It's not even a comedy show anymore.

1846
01:10:32,932 --> 01:10:36,285
It's more of a hostage situation in here.

1847
01:10:36,319 --> 01:10:37,737
I look at the smile on your face, sir.

1848
01:10:37,771 --> 01:10:41,073
You're just happy I'm
not your son, aren't ya?

1849
01:10:41,107 --> 01:10:42,658
I don't know if you
can tell from my accent,

1850
01:10:42,692 --> 01:10:44,275
but I'm white.

1851
01:10:45,495 --> 01:10:47,163
Didn't always used to look like this.

1852
01:10:47,197 --> 01:10:48,464
Before I moved to Hollywood,

1853
01:10:48,498 --> 01:10:50,948
I was a twelve-year-old
girl with a dream.

1854
01:10:53,837 --> 01:10:56,839
My pussy looks terrible.

1855
01:10:56,873 --> 01:10:59,456
I got a clit that looks
like a carpenter's thumb.

1856
01:11:02,462 --> 01:11:03,596
All right, you folks better get into this

1857
01:11:03,630 --> 01:11:04,647
because at the end of the show,

1858
01:11:04,681 --> 01:11:06,482
I put my fist up my ass and sing

1859
01:11:06,516 --> 01:11:07,933
"I'm a Little Teapot."

1860
01:11:07,967 --> 01:11:09,435
So,

1861
01:11:09,469 --> 01:11:12,102
you're gonna get wet, Jebediah.

1862
01:11:13,473 --> 01:11:14,657
I don't know if you're smiling, sir,

1863
01:11:14,691 --> 01:11:18,110
or you're having a stroke.

1864
01:11:18,144 --> 01:11:18,911
You can look away, sir,

1865
01:11:18,945 --> 01:11:20,978
but the bad man's still here.

1866
01:11:22,148 --> 01:11:22,832
Good thing about you,

1867
01:11:22,866 --> 01:11:23,949
if I fuck you up the ass,

1868
01:11:23,983 --> 01:11:25,816
you're not gonna remember shit.

1869
01:11:27,153 --> 01:11:29,205
I guess what I'm trying to say is

1870
01:11:29,239 --> 01:11:31,155
I need a place to stay tonight.

1871
01:11:34,994 --> 01:11:37,513
A lot of beautiful women here tonight.

1872
01:11:37,547 --> 01:11:40,216
Give a round of applause for all the hot

1873
01:11:40,250 --> 01:11:41,999
pussy.

1874
01:11:43,253 --> 01:11:45,020
Oh, man, I love vaginas.

1875
01:11:45,054 --> 01:11:46,472
They're like old men with beards.

1876
01:11:46,506 --> 01:11:49,809
They've got stories and
bad breath, don't they?

1877
01:11:49,843 --> 01:11:53,896
"Our fore fathers, hehehe."

1878
01:11:53,930 --> 01:11:55,679
Sir, they can't talk now.

1879
01:11:57,016 --> 01:11:58,234
Blonde, blue-eyed girls in here.

1880
01:11:58,268 --> 01:11:59,318
Love that.

1881
01:11:59,352 --> 01:12:00,653
I lived in Stockholm for three years.

1882
01:12:00,687 --> 01:12:01,987
A lot of girls like you,

1883
01:12:02,021 --> 01:12:03,987
except they're, like, really pretty.

1884
01:12:06,025 --> 01:12:08,359
I'm... serious.

1885
01:12:10,196 --> 01:12:10,996
The truth is,

1886
01:12:11,030 --> 01:12:12,882
I haven't see a vagina in so long,

1887
01:12:12,916 --> 01:12:14,500
I've been jacking off to my own ass

1888
01:12:14,534 --> 01:12:15,866
in the mirror.

1889
01:12:17,203 --> 01:12:18,170
Yeah, I put lipstick on it

1890
01:12:18,204 --> 01:12:20,840
so it's not so gay.

1891
01:12:20,874 --> 01:12:21,891
Every morning in the mirror,

1892
01:12:21,925 --> 01:12:25,094
"Ooh, I didn't see you come in. Hahahaha."

1893
01:12:25,128 --> 01:12:26,262
Buh-lah.

1894
01:12:26,296 --> 01:12:28,013
That's the sound it makes when I cum.

1895
01:12:28,047 --> 01:12:31,851
I'm 42. Buh-lah.

1896
01:12:31,885 --> 01:12:33,352
In my twenties, I had a cum shot that had

1897
01:12:33,386 --> 01:12:35,437
accuracy and distance.

1898
01:12:35,471 --> 01:12:36,605
I could hit a girl's face

1899
01:12:36,639 --> 01:12:39,390
from ten feet and make it
look like a dreamcatcher.

1900
01:12:40,894 --> 01:12:41,861
Now when I cum,

1901
01:12:41,895 --> 01:12:44,528
it looks like I popped a zit on my cock.

1902
01:12:47,533 --> 01:12:48,617
It sucks getting older.

1903
01:12:48,651 --> 01:12:50,586
My nutsack looks like

1904
01:12:50,620 --> 01:12:53,070
chicken skin and cherry tomatoes.

1905
01:12:54,123 --> 01:12:55,207
I don't think I can get a girl pregnant,

1906
01:12:55,241 --> 01:12:56,542
but I can give you Salmonella,

1907
01:12:56,576 --> 01:12:58,878
I'll tell you that.

1908
01:12:58,912 --> 01:13:00,546
My balls drop any more,

1909
01:13:00,580 --> 01:13:01,380
I'll be able to put them

1910
01:13:01,414 --> 01:13:03,380
in my mouth when I jack off.

1911
01:13:04,417 --> 01:13:06,333
And check my pulse.

1912
01:13:08,137 --> 01:13:09,889
I guess what I'm trying to say is

1913
01:13:09,923 --> 01:13:12,222
I always wanted kids, you know?

1914
01:13:13,927 --> 01:13:16,562
But I could never catch them.

1915
01:13:16,596 --> 01:13:18,447
It's hard to run in those big clown shoes

1916
01:13:18,481 --> 01:13:20,147
with an erection.

1917
01:13:23,519 --> 01:13:25,154
Don't worry, there's
going to be a therapist

1918
01:13:25,188 --> 01:13:28,240
to talk to you after the show.

1919
01:13:28,274 --> 01:13:30,626
<i>I'll be at the door with
a little teddy bear going,</i>

1920
01:13:30,660 --> 01:13:32,494
"Show me where the comedian touched you.

1921
01:13:32,528 --> 01:13:34,747
"Show me on the teddy bear.

1922
01:13:34,781 --> 01:13:36,916
"Ahahahaha!

1923
01:13:36,950 --> 01:13:40,252
"Look at me! Look at me!"

1924
01:13:40,286 --> 01:13:41,587
You got your hand over your vagina

1925
01:13:41,621 --> 01:13:43,253
like I'm gonna steal it.

1926
01:13:44,624 --> 01:13:47,624
I'm Canadian. I've
already got a winter hat.

1927
01:13:51,631 --> 01:13:53,265
<i>You're going to jail.</i>

1928
01:13:53,299 --> 01:13:55,100
I'm going to jail? Good.

1929
01:13:55,134 --> 01:13:56,850
Then I'll get fucked for a change.

1930
01:13:58,137 --> 01:13:59,688
And if I go to jail,

1931
01:13:59,722 --> 01:14:02,306
you can give your asshole a night off.

1932
01:14:03,393 --> 01:14:04,944
That's where she likes it.

1933
01:14:04,978 --> 01:14:06,779
It's the only way she can feel it now.

1934
01:14:06,813 --> 01:14:08,030
I used to fuck her so hard,

1935
01:14:08,064 --> 01:14:10,814
she used to push her
uterus back in with a ruler.

1936
01:14:12,318 --> 01:14:13,901
"No kissing!"

1937
01:14:16,739 --> 01:14:18,322
Uh, any questions?

1938
01:14:21,160 --> 01:14:22,962
This room is very divided.

1939
01:14:22,996 --> 01:14:24,380
There's some people laughing

1940
01:14:24,414 --> 01:14:25,381
and other people are going,

1941
01:14:25,415 --> 01:14:27,164
"The police should have been here by now."

1942
01:14:31,387 --> 01:14:32,855
Instead of going after older women now...

1943
01:14:32,889 --> 01:14:34,473
I like older women, they got experience,

1944
01:14:34,507 --> 01:14:36,473
their own money, arthritis.

1945
01:14:38,061 --> 01:14:39,528
The kind of girl when you
push her legs behind her head,

1946
01:14:39,562 --> 01:14:41,845
you know they're gonna stay there.

1947
01:14:46,736 --> 01:14:48,852
"Ah, now the diaper."

1948
01:14:50,690 --> 01:14:54,410
♪ Something in the air tonight ♪

1949
01:14:54,444 --> 01:14:56,860
When she wakes up, you tell her she fell.

1950
01:14:58,364 --> 01:15:00,332
"Is that true, Henry?"

1951
01:15:00,366 --> 01:15:02,366
"Ha, ha, ha. You'll forget."

1952
01:15:03,536 --> 01:15:05,004
'Cause when you have Alzheimer's disease,

1953
01:15:05,038 --> 01:15:07,421
every time's the first time, isn't it?

1954
01:15:09,759 --> 01:15:12,761
Ever have your fist in old lady's pussy?

1955
01:15:12,795 --> 01:15:14,346
It feels like you're mixing paint,

1956
01:15:14,380 --> 01:15:17,681
just [sloshing sound].

1957
01:15:35,902 --> 01:15:38,902
Uh, airplane food is weird, huh?

1958
01:15:40,239 --> 01:15:41,872
What the fuck do you people want?

1959
01:15:43,409 --> 01:15:45,292
Thank you.

1960
01:15:47,580 --> 01:15:49,598
Actually, I was getting a
blow job the other night.

1961
01:15:49,632 --> 01:15:51,600
She asked me to warn
her when I was gonna cum,

1962
01:15:51,634 --> 01:15:54,636
so I farted.

1963
01:15:54,670 --> 01:15:57,973
What more of a warning do you bitches need?

1964
01:15:58,007 --> 01:15:59,975
You hear that funny noise,

1965
01:16:00,009 --> 01:16:03,062
get the fuck out of Dodge.

1966
01:16:03,096 --> 01:16:05,898
She's all like, "Blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah,"

1967
01:16:05,932 --> 01:16:09,401
and I'm like, "I don't pay you to talk."

1968
01:16:09,435 --> 01:16:11,737
"Ah!

1969
01:16:11,771 --> 01:16:12,621
Family, though.

1970
01:16:12,655 --> 01:16:13,937
What are ya gonna do?

1971
01:16:20,863 --> 01:16:22,414
I know there's some guys that frown upon

1972
01:16:22,448 --> 01:16:24,249
guys who go down on girls on their period,

1973
01:16:24,283 --> 01:16:26,802
but I prefer it.

1974
01:16:26,836 --> 01:16:27,920
No, it's not what you think.

1975
01:16:27,954 --> 01:16:30,305
My last relationship,
we used to fight a lot,

1976
01:16:30,339 --> 01:16:32,257
so I liked to pretend
that I was killing her.

1977
01:16:32,291 --> 01:16:33,423
You know...

1978
01:16:36,379 --> 01:16:38,347
"Ah! There is no God!"

1979
01:16:38,381 --> 01:16:40,816
I go to the door, Jehovah's Witnesses

1980
01:16:40,850 --> 01:16:43,018
are standing there, I'm covered in blood.

1981
01:16:43,052 --> 01:16:45,268
"Ah! A ha ha!"

1982
01:16:46,522 --> 01:16:48,805
"Just kidding, it's pussy. Mmmm, mmmmm."

1983
01:16:49,892 --> 01:16:53,445
"Look at me!"

1984
01:16:53,479 --> 01:16:54,613
Just trying to make this Christmas

1985
01:16:54,647 --> 01:16:56,196
a white one.

1986
01:16:59,368 --> 01:17:00,119
This is the part of the show

1987
01:17:00,153 --> 01:17:01,003
where I come to the audience

1988
01:17:01,037 --> 01:17:02,703
and I rape somebody.

1989
01:17:04,824 --> 01:17:05,791
Look at all the girls,

1990
01:17:05,825 --> 01:17:07,793
"Did I remember to bring pepper spray?"

1991
01:17:07,827 --> 01:17:10,879
It doesn't work on me, I'm used to it.

1992
01:17:10,913 --> 01:17:13,463
And I stay hard and I finish.

1993
01:17:21,424 --> 01:17:23,642
All right, now it's time for me to get into

1994
01:17:23,676 --> 01:17:26,009
my comedy routine.

1995
01:17:34,520 --> 01:17:35,871
I love it.

1996
01:17:35,905 --> 01:17:37,656
These first two rows are looking at me

1997
01:17:37,690 --> 01:17:40,709
like the Church of Latter Day Saints.

1998
01:17:40,743 --> 01:17:43,694
What, you guys think
you came to see "Cats"?

1999
01:17:45,031 --> 01:17:47,531
"We went to the theater
and we saw the devil."

2000
01:17:49,202 --> 01:17:52,337
"He's from Canada."

2001
01:17:52,371 --> 01:17:53,755
Shoot me, I don't give a fuck.

2002
01:17:53,789 --> 01:17:55,288
I got healthcare.

2003
01:17:56,759 --> 01:17:59,092
Bon jour!

2004
01:18:00,296 --> 01:18:02,064
Uh, I gotta leave now because

2005
01:18:02,098 --> 01:18:03,682
the police are here.

2006
01:18:03,716 --> 01:18:04,933
That's right.

2007
01:18:04,967 --> 01:18:08,737
Uh, before I go, if you see
me outside after the show,

2008
01:18:08,771 --> 01:18:10,689
please don't hit my face.

2009
01:18:10,723 --> 01:18:13,523
I've got a job interview
at a school tomorrow.

2010
01:18:16,112 --> 01:18:17,894
Guidance counselor.

2011
01:18:32,078 --> 01:18:33,262
Jason Rouse.

2012
01:18:33,296 --> 01:18:34,961
Let's hear it for him.

2013
01:18:41,254 --> 01:18:42,221
I gotta say,

2014
01:18:42,255 --> 01:18:45,224
you have been an incredible audience.

2015
01:18:45,258 --> 01:18:46,608
We've had a great time performing

2016
01:18:46,642 --> 01:18:48,560
for you tonight and I'd like

2017
01:18:48,594 --> 01:18:50,062
to bring out all the performers.

2018
01:18:50,096 --> 01:18:53,563
Erik Myers, come on out, take a bow.

2019
01:18:55,651 --> 01:18:58,919
Michael Wheels Parise.

2020
01:19:00,256 --> 01:19:02,706
Steve Wilson.

2021
01:19:03,926 --> 01:19:07,094
Eleanor Kerrigan.

2022
01:19:08,598 --> 01:19:11,047
Colin Kane.

2023
01:19:13,603 --> 01:19:16,855
Jason Rouse.

2024
01:19:16,889 --> 01:19:19,024
And the Smash Brothers, come on out.

2025
01:19:19,058 --> 01:19:20,409
Let's take a bow.

2026
01:19:20,443 --> 01:19:22,244
You have been phenomenal.

2027
01:19:22,278 --> 01:19:24,196
Thank you and good night.

2028
01:19:24,230 --> 01:19:26,031
Take a bow, everybody.

2029
01:19:26,065 --> 01:19:28,398
Thank you very much.

2030
01:20:00,083 --> 01:20:02,218
<i>Andrew, you're the man!</i>
