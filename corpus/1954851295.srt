1
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:44,610
<i> I've heard people say</i>
 <i> that life is like a river.</i>

2
00:00:44,811 --> 00:00:46,712
      <i> And we're all</i>
      <i> just tiny minnows</i>

3
00:00:46,714 --> 00:00:51,150
<i> struggling through the freeze,</i>
<i> the thaw and the flow.</i>

4
00:00:53,319 --> 00:00:55,587
      <i> Sometimes it's</i>
      <i> a momentous event,</i>

5
00:00:55,589 --> 00:01:00,192
 <i> a birth or a death that</i>
 <i> causes the currents to shift.</i>

6
00:01:01,494 --> 00:01:07,599
 <i> And sometimes it's something</i>
 <i> as simple as your best friend</i>
 <i> going home early one night.</i>

7
00:01:18,778 --> 00:01:20,312
What the fuck
     is wrong with you?

8
00:01:20,314 --> 00:01:23,682
     What is wrong with me
     for ever fucking
     being with you!

9
00:01:23,684 --> 00:01:26,485
Listen...
     -You make me so mad!

10
00:01:26,487 --> 00:01:28,754
 Will you listen to me? Please.

11
00:01:28,756 --> 00:01:31,523
     Sleep in the
     fucking greenhouse.

12
00:02:08,528 --> 00:02:10,329
- Dad.

13
00:02:10,331 --> 00:02:13,098
  Hey! Look who's still up.

14
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:15,000
 Where's your best bud Teddy?

15
00:02:15,002 --> 00:02:16,635
    He went home hours ago.

16
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:18,003
         He did, huh?

17
00:02:18,338 --> 00:02:20,339
    Here, sit down. Join me.

18
00:02:20,341 --> 00:02:21,707
    Take a load off, my man.

19
00:02:21,709 --> 00:02:23,342
--Okay.

20
00:02:23,344 --> 00:02:26,578
 I bet you're wondering
 why Mom has me out here, huh?

21
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:27,045
             Mmm.

22
00:02:27,047 --> 00:02:30,149
     Well, can I tell you
     something, hmm?

23
00:02:30,151 --> 00:02:33,218
        I'd like to talk
        to another guy.

24
00:02:33,586 --> 00:02:36,188
    You know mommy's friend,
    Mrs. Donahue,

25
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:37,623
 did you know she's pregnant?

26
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:39,858
 Hmm? She's gonna have a baby.

27
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:40,959
             Oh.

28
00:02:40,961 --> 00:02:43,862
    The trouble is you know
    who made her pregnant?

29
00:02:46,866 --> 00:02:48,167
             Me.

30
00:02:48,169 --> 00:02:49,401
             Mmm.

31
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,069
         Is Mom pissed?

32
00:02:51,071 --> 00:02:54,506
     She is. I mean,
     she's really pissed.

33
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:56,542
     She doesn't think she
     wants to be married
     to me anymore

34
00:02:56,544 --> 00:02:58,177
     and now she's gonna be
     even more pissed that
     I told you,

35
00:02:58,179 --> 00:03:00,946
  but I think, you know, you
  deserve to know the truth.

36
00:03:00,948 --> 00:03:02,514
     You're a big guy now.

37
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:05,050
     What's gonna happen
     to the baby?

38
00:03:05,818 --> 00:03:08,253
     Some babies are never
     born at all, you know?

39
00:03:08,255 --> 00:03:10,589
  And some babies are born,
  their parents take care
  of 'em,

40
00:03:10,591 --> 00:03:13,625
  some babies, you know,
  somebody else raises 'em.

41
00:03:13,627 --> 00:03:14,660
     You know, like, uh...

42
00:03:14,662 --> 00:03:17,596
     What's that stupid TV
     show you always watch
      with your sister?

43
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:20,766
 With the two little black kids
 and the rich white guy.

44
00:03:20,768 --> 00:03:22,000
     Oh, <i> Diff'rent Strokes.</i>

45
00:03:22,002 --> 00:03:23,502
    Right, okay. Well
    they're adopted, right?

46
00:03:23,504 --> 00:03:25,938
      So, you know all
      about that, right?

47
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:26,805
      I mean, that's...

48
00:03:26,807 --> 00:03:28,740
  That's another thing I've
  been wanting to tell you,

49
00:03:28,742 --> 00:03:30,108
      you know, but
      your mom's like...

50
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:33,812
You know, it's
  gotta be the perfect time.

51
00:03:35,082 --> 00:03:38,850
    But I think that you should
    know, you know?

52
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:40,385
          Know what?

53
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:42,487
  The truth about your life.

54
00:03:42,489 --> 00:03:43,255
        You're adopted.

55
00:03:43,257 --> 00:03:46,191
 It's not a big deal.
 I mean Aristotle was adopted.

56
00:03:46,193 --> 00:03:47,659
  Lee Majors, you know him,

57
00:03:47,661 --> 00:03:50,028
      <i> The Six Million</i>
      <i> Dollar Man,</i> right?

58
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:50,462
        He was adopted.

59
00:03:50,464 --> 00:03:54,166
 Tons of people are adopted
 and you wouldn't even know it.

60
00:03:54,968 --> 00:03:56,335
         Yeah, so...

61
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:58,403
     I mean, there it is.

62
00:03:59,138 --> 00:04:02,174
     Does that mean
     Mr. Donahue is my dad?

63
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:03,575
No!

64
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:04,843
      Champ, come here.

65
00:04:04,845 --> 00:04:05,911
        Come here, come
        here, come here.

66
00:04:05,913 --> 00:04:07,412
        I'm your dad for
        crying out loud.

67
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:09,481
  I'll be your dad forever.
  Get up here.

68
00:04:09,483 --> 00:04:11,416
Get up here.

69
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:13,318
Can I sleep
     here with you, Dad?

70
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,287
      Oh, I'd love that.

71
00:04:15,289 --> 00:04:15,587
             Mmm.

72
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:19,358
     But I think your mom's
     pissed enough at me,
     don't you?

73
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:22,961
      So get your butt
      back in bed, huh.

74
00:04:24,365 --> 00:04:27,666
     You'll be here
     in the morning, right?

75
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:33,005
     Mmm, we'll see what
     tomorrow brings.

76
00:04:45,251 --> 00:04:47,119
<i> I often wondered</i>

77
00:04:47,121 --> 00:04:49,755
     <i> if Teddy hadn't left</i>
     <i> so early that night,</i>

78
00:04:49,757 --> 00:04:54,159
    <i> maybe I would never have</i>
    <i> had that conversation</i>
    <i> with my dad.</i>

79
00:04:54,594 --> 00:04:58,563
  <i> Maybe our lives would have</i>
  <i> stayed secure and naive.</i>

80
00:04:59,832 --> 00:05:02,734
     <i> Maybe we would never</i>
     <i> have met Eliza.</i>

81
00:05:03,836 --> 00:05:06,538
  <i> Maybe this whole story</i>
  <i> would never have happened.</i>

82
00:05:12,845 --> 00:05:13,979
          Oh, fuck!

83
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:24,890
    Oh, God damn it, Teddy.

84
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:28,026
         Okay. Okay.

85
00:05:29,762 --> 00:05:30,595
         Thanks, man.

86
00:05:30,597 --> 00:05:33,432
Jesus, we have
    a front door, you know.

87
00:05:33,434 --> 00:05:34,800
        Uh, yeah, yeah.

88
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:37,569
         Guess what?

89
00:05:37,571 --> 00:05:40,939
    -What?
    -My mom took off again.

90
00:05:40,941 --> 00:05:41,707
             Shit.

91
00:05:41,709 --> 00:05:42,874
 She got shit faced last night

92
00:05:42,876 --> 00:05:44,409
    and then when I woke up
    in the morning

93
00:05:44,411 --> 00:05:47,212
     her and all her stuff
     were just gone.

94
00:05:47,313 --> 00:05:49,414
 Well, I mean she'll come back.

95
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:50,148
        She always does.

96
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:52,984
     Yeah, well, fuck it.
     I don't even care.

97
00:05:52,986 --> 00:05:55,387
    I'm all about trying
    to get to New York now.

98
00:05:55,389 --> 00:05:57,222
 My brother had the right idea.

99
00:05:57,224 --> 00:05:59,491
     Well, I'm all about
     getting some weed.

100
00:05:59,493 --> 00:06:02,861
     It's New Year's Eve
     and we're bone dry.

101
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:07,366
      Hey, Prudence, can
      I borrow 40 bucks?

102
00:06:07,368 --> 00:06:09,301
     What happened to
     your glasses, Teddy?

103
00:06:09,303 --> 00:06:10,202
        I got contacts.

104
00:06:10,204 --> 00:06:13,004
     Oh, you looked better
     with glasses.

105
00:06:18,177 --> 00:06:21,813
My, uh, my
    brother, he was telling
    me about this college.

106
00:06:21,815 --> 00:06:23,482
        It's like, right
        next to CBGB's.

107
00:06:23,484 --> 00:06:25,283
     It's free, it's just
     really hard to get in.

108
00:06:25,285 --> 00:06:28,353
You know college
     is gonna suck just as
     much as high school.

109
00:06:28,355 --> 00:06:29,821
Yeah, but we'll
     be in New York.

110
00:06:29,823 --> 00:06:32,224
What's so great
     about New York anyway?

111
00:06:32,226 --> 00:06:33,725
No parents for one.

112
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,694
Speak for yourself.

113
00:06:39,233 --> 00:06:40,298
          Oh, shit!

114
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,801
      -What is in there?
      -It's resin.

115
00:06:42,803 --> 00:06:44,469
     I scraped it
     out of my mom's pipe.

116
00:06:44,471 --> 00:06:47,539
Well, at least she
     left you something.

117
00:06:49,275 --> 00:06:52,644
  I think my dad's down
  in New York too, actually.

118
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:53,945
             What?

119
00:06:53,947 --> 00:06:56,481
      I thought you said
      your dad died.

120
00:06:56,483 --> 00:06:58,917
     Yeah, that's what
     my mom says, but...

121
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:01,987
 Well, Johnny seems
 to think she's full of shit.

122
00:07:04,258 --> 00:07:07,225
 Well, you know, this is beat.

123
00:07:10,563 --> 00:07:12,097
          Oh, shit.

124
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:15,066
         -Check it out.
         -What?

125
00:07:21,809 --> 00:07:23,475
     What are you doing?

126
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:29,414
--Oh, dude, gross.

127
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:31,950
 Oh, yeah, it's Sandy McCoy's.

128
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:33,618
        I'm telling you.

129
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:47,799
          Oh, great.

130
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:49,067
  Oh, it's hitting me hard.

131
00:07:49,069 --> 00:07:51,336
      -Okay, I'm ready.
      -Wait.

132
00:07:51,338 --> 00:07:52,671
    Is it panty or panties?

133
00:07:52,673 --> 00:07:54,372
     Oh, okay, so panties
     is plural...

134
00:07:54,374 --> 00:07:57,142
- Shut up and take it.

135
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:13,859
          Hey, Mom.

136
00:08:13,861 --> 00:08:15,293
         Hey, Mrs. H.

137
00:08:16,028 --> 00:08:17,395
          Hey, guys.

138
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,564
     Mom, can I get a loan?

139
00:08:19,566 --> 00:08:21,700
     I already gave you
     your birthday present.

140
00:08:21,702 --> 00:08:23,068
     Yeah, but I spent it.

141
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:24,035
  Your father called again,

142
00:08:24,037 --> 00:08:26,071
    that girl Eliza will be
    here at 6:05 now.

143
00:08:26,073 --> 00:08:27,706
 She's taking a different bus.

144
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:29,207
         Who's Eliza?

145
00:08:29,209 --> 00:08:30,275
         Eliza Caplan.

146
00:08:30,277 --> 00:08:31,209
  The ballerina's daughter.

147
00:08:31,211 --> 00:08:33,345
     -Who's a ballerina?
     -My dad's girlfriend.

148
00:08:33,347 --> 00:08:37,048
    Apparently Eliza was up
    at a ski trip with some
     prep school girls.

149
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:40,285
    She's making a pit stop
    here before heading home
    after midnight.

150
00:08:40,287 --> 00:08:42,320
 That's even more of a reason
 I'll need some money.

151
00:08:42,322 --> 00:08:44,456
  Well, let's hope your dad
  sent her with some.

152
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:46,791
     You know, I don't even
     know why he sent her.

153
00:08:46,793 --> 00:08:47,959
      I don't know her.

154
00:08:47,961 --> 00:08:50,161
    Well, maybe he's finally
    reaching out to you

155
00:08:50,163 --> 00:08:52,864
    without getting his own
    hands dirty, of course.

156
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:55,600
  You know my dad is an
  absolute fucking asshole!

157
00:08:55,602 --> 00:08:59,804
    I mean, what, I've seen
    him a few times in the
      last seven years?

158
00:08:59,806 --> 00:09:02,474
    And out of nowhere he
    sends this fucking girl.

159
00:09:02,476 --> 00:09:05,544
  Yeah, I mean like, your
  average Manhattan girl is

160
00:09:05,546 --> 00:09:09,080
     way hotter than the
     cream of the crop here
     in Lintonburg, so...

161
00:09:09,082 --> 00:09:10,582
             Dude.

162
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,722
- You think that's...
- I don't know.

163
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:23,395
     Excuse me are you, uh,
     are you Eliza?

164
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:26,965
  Which one of you is Jude?

165
00:09:28,034 --> 00:09:30,068
     That would be, uh, me.

166
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:32,537
     You don't look like
     a Prudence.

167
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:35,574
 Oh, uh, no, Prudence, uh...

168
00:09:35,576 --> 00:09:36,741
  She's at home, I'm Teddy.

169
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:37,976
 What's on your face, Teddy?

170
00:09:37,978 --> 00:09:41,479
 Is that some sort of Dracula
 skate punk thing, uh...

171
00:09:41,481 --> 00:09:42,414
        Oh, right, um...

172
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:46,451
    It's, we get it from...
    We huffed turpentine.

173
00:09:46,453 --> 00:09:47,319
             Shit.

174
00:09:47,321 --> 00:09:50,956
  That is like, that's sad.

175
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:55,727
Happy New Year!

176
00:09:57,731 --> 00:09:58,263
             Wow!

177
00:09:58,265 --> 00:09:59,898
     Welcome to
     exciting Lintonburg.

178
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:02,901
     Yeah, this should be
     interesting, right?

179
00:10:02,903 --> 00:10:07,005
     You know we should
     probably just crash
     Tory Ventura's party.

180
00:10:07,007 --> 00:10:08,473
 I mean, he's a total douche,

181
00:10:08,475 --> 00:10:10,008
     but he is a
     major drug connection.

182
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:11,543
--Everyone goes.

183
00:10:11,545 --> 00:10:13,311
     Yeah, unfortunately
     it'll be filled with

184
00:10:13,313 --> 00:10:15,146
     like, jocks and metal
     heads, I don't know

185
00:10:15,148 --> 00:10:16,748
     if your boyfriend's
     one of those, but...

186
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,350
     No, uh... No, I
     don't have a boyfriend

187
00:10:18,352 --> 00:10:21,953
 and if I did he wouldn't be
 a jock or a metal head.

188
00:10:23,689 --> 00:10:26,324
     So you guys strike me
     as Misfits fans.

189
00:10:26,326 --> 00:10:27,225
             -Yeah.
             -Yes.

190
00:10:27,227 --> 00:10:28,727
     -Yeah.
     -No, we love Misfits.

191
00:10:28,729 --> 00:10:31,129
     I mean, we're into
     all kinds of hardcore,

192
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:32,497
          but, uh...

193
00:10:32,499 --> 00:10:33,365
         Are you? Nice.

194
00:10:33,367 --> 00:10:35,333
     Uh, my brother
     actually has a band

195
00:10:35,335 --> 00:10:37,135
     in the East Village,
     it's uh, Army of One.

196
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:40,705
     They're like hardcore
     but they're also like,
     Straight Edge.

197
00:10:40,707 --> 00:10:41,306
     What's Straight Edge?

198
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:44,175
  It's a whole other scene,
  no drugs, no sex, no meat,

199
00:10:44,177 --> 00:10:46,211
  -like drinking or weed...
  -Boring.

200
00:10:46,213 --> 00:10:46,845
         -Basically.
         -Yeah.

201
00:10:46,847 --> 00:10:49,514
    -That's pretty boring.
    -But, uh, their music's
        pretty awesome.

202
00:10:49,516 --> 00:10:52,450
 I saw the Misfits once at
 Irving Plaza when I was 11.

203
00:10:52,452 --> 00:10:55,920
     It was my first show
     with the Necros and
     the Beastie Boys.

204
00:10:55,922 --> 00:10:58,256
      You went to a show
      when you were 11?

205
00:10:58,258 --> 00:11:00,625
      Yeah, I mean
      I didn't go alone.

206
00:11:00,627 --> 00:11:02,060
     Who did you go with?

207
00:11:02,062 --> 00:11:03,061
          Your dad.

208
00:11:03,063 --> 00:11:04,195
 He put me on his shoulders.

209
00:11:04,197 --> 00:11:07,666
    I could see everything.
    It was such a good show.

210
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:11,102
Christ!

211
00:11:11,104 --> 00:11:13,104
Look, how long are you
 gonna keep writing, huh?

212
00:11:13,106 --> 00:11:13,772
     It's New Year's Eve.

213
00:11:13,774 --> 00:11:15,640
No, I've got to
     finish Eliza's essay

214
00:11:15,642 --> 00:11:16,508
     for the Taft Academy.

215
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:19,277
    Yeah, well shouldn't she
    do that herself, hmm?

216
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:19,577
            She did.

217
00:11:19,579 --> 00:11:21,980
 And she answered the question
 about her future goals

218
00:11:21,982 --> 00:11:26,418
     with a 250-word essay
     on her ambitions to be
     a makeup artist.

219
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:28,553
     -Mmm.
     -Written in eyeliner.

220
00:11:28,555 --> 00:11:31,022
  -I applaud her creativity.
  -Yeah.

221
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:32,824
         -You would.
         -Mmm.

222
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:36,928
  You got any New Year
  resolutions, Princess Di?

223
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:39,364
        -Yes.
        -What are they?

224
00:11:39,598 --> 00:11:41,332
  To stop dating my dealer.

225
00:11:41,334 --> 00:11:42,167
     Why would you do that?

226
00:11:42,169 --> 00:11:43,368
     With me you get the
     whole package.

227
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:46,905
     -Sex and drugs, huh.
     -Oh, yeah I forgot.

228
00:11:46,907 --> 00:11:50,542
<i> ...clocks, and then 1988!</i>

229
00:12:00,953 --> 00:12:03,755
     I wonder how Eliza's
     doing in Vermont.

230
00:12:03,757 --> 00:12:05,490
    She's doing great. Mmm.

231
00:12:05,492 --> 00:12:08,793
 Well, if your children
 are anything like their father

232
00:12:08,795 --> 00:12:10,095
  I should be very worried.

233
00:12:10,097 --> 00:12:11,596
 Mmm, my kids are good eggs.

234
00:12:11,598 --> 00:12:14,065
  You'd have to actually be
  around them to know that,
         wouldn't you?

235
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:18,903
 Well, I've been around your
 daughter for years and let
    me tell you something.

236
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:21,072
  She is no delicate flower.

237
00:12:22,042 --> 00:12:26,678
Dude, did I piss you
 off before when I said that
     thing about your dad?

238
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:28,446
 Why would I be pissed at you?

239
00:12:28,448 --> 00:12:31,082
     It's not your fault
     my dad's a prick.

240
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:33,451
     Les is not a prick,
     all right?

241
00:12:33,453 --> 00:12:36,788
     I actually think
     he feels extremely bad
     about everything.

242
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:38,389
      What's everything?

243
00:12:38,891 --> 00:12:40,759
     Deserting you, uh...

244
00:12:40,761 --> 00:12:41,926
 Not being there for you guys.

245
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:43,762
     You should have seen
     him at Christmas.

246
00:12:43,764 --> 00:12:44,329
    He got drunk, all right,

247
00:12:44,331 --> 00:12:47,165
     and he was outside on
     the balcony crying
     like a baby.

248
00:12:47,167 --> 00:12:50,168
 It was right after he
 talked to you on the phone.

249
00:12:50,536 --> 00:12:53,338
    You were standing there
    when I talked to my dad?

250
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:55,006
    He was in my apartment.

251
00:12:55,008 --> 00:12:56,107
     I mean, don't you
     think it's sad though?

252
00:12:56,109 --> 00:13:01,045
     No, what's sad is how
     he sent you to be his
      little messenger.

253
00:13:01,347 --> 00:13:02,614
         Oh, my God.

254
00:13:02,616 --> 00:13:03,948
    Les would never do that.

255
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:06,017
     In fact, he called me
     a drama queen

256
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:08,620
     and a sad story addict
     for wanting to come.

257
00:13:08,622 --> 00:13:11,990
    No, you know my dad
    is a sad fucking story.

258
00:13:11,992 --> 00:13:13,691
      Not me, all right?

259
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:20,965
             Whoo!

260
00:13:22,168 --> 00:13:23,568
     Did I say something?

261
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:25,270
 No. I'll be right back, okay?

262
00:13:25,272 --> 00:13:27,205
      Can you hold this?

263
00:13:32,211 --> 00:13:34,112
Jude!

264
00:13:35,781 --> 00:13:37,482
          Oh, shit.

265
00:13:40,886 --> 00:13:43,054
    Whose car is this, man?

266
00:13:44,557 --> 00:13:46,558
          Who cares?

267
00:13:48,928 --> 00:13:53,164
    Jude, are you just
    gonna sit there and be
    pissed off at the world?

268
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:55,033
      Eliza was just
      trying to be nice.

269
00:13:55,035 --> 00:13:57,302
     She was also being
     pretty fucking nosey.

270
00:13:57,304 --> 00:14:00,104
     Yeah, but she's also
     pretty fucking pretty.

271
00:14:00,106 --> 00:14:02,273
 Right? You've got to admit.

272
00:14:02,275 --> 00:14:03,942
     She's pretty enough.

273
00:14:03,944 --> 00:14:04,776
            Enough?

274
00:14:04,778 --> 00:14:06,544
      Wow, you're picky.

275
00:14:06,912 --> 00:14:08,413
     You think she's hot,
     don't you?

276
00:14:08,415 --> 00:14:09,614
     You think she's hot,
     don't you?

277
00:14:09,616 --> 00:14:10,682
 You got a boner for her, huh?

278
00:14:10,684 --> 00:14:12,650
    -Will you stop, asshole?
    -Oh! Oh! Oh!

279
00:14:12,652 --> 00:14:15,186
- Dude! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
- What?

280
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:16,187
             Dude!

281
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:17,655
    I lost my contact, man.

282
00:14:17,657 --> 00:14:20,625
 -Aw, shit.
 -I spent all my money on that.

283
00:14:22,928 --> 00:14:23,995
             Uh...

284
00:14:23,997 --> 00:14:26,364
 Oh, wait. Wait, is this it?

285
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,700
     Jesus, you found it.

286
00:14:29,468 --> 00:14:33,304
 I'm gonna find the bathroom.
 Are you gonna come back
 to the party?

287
00:14:46,018 --> 00:14:46,751
             Teddy!

288
00:14:46,753 --> 00:14:49,153
     There you are.
     I've missed you, baby.

289
00:14:49,155 --> 00:14:50,588
        -Hey, Annabelle.
        -Annabelle?

290
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:52,891
Yeah,
     keep going just go.

291
00:14:52,893 --> 00:14:54,926
     Where are you going?

292
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:05,136
  Oh, my God, that guy was
  totally about to maul me.

293
00:15:05,138 --> 00:15:06,771
      Did you see that?

294
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:12,410
     Why are you looking
     at me like that?

295
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:14,879
         Is that coke?

296
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:17,615
  You can't be that country.

297
00:15:17,617 --> 00:15:19,617
        Have you never
        done it before?

298
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:21,719
     I, uh, snorted some

299
00:15:21,721 --> 00:15:24,923
ground up chalk as a
     joke once.

300
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:28,493
      Well, your luck's
      about to change.

301
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:35,566
          Oh, yeah.

302
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,003
          Oh, shit!

303
00:15:39,005 --> 00:15:41,005
Whoa, whoa.

304
00:15:41,907 --> 00:15:42,840
          Oh, shit!

305
00:15:42,842 --> 00:15:43,741
        -Fucker!
        -Oh, I'm sorry!

306
00:15:43,743 --> 00:15:45,376
     What the fuck are you
     doing in my car, huh?

307
00:15:45,378 --> 00:15:46,377
         I didn't!
         No, I wasn't!

308
00:15:46,379 --> 00:15:47,445
        You touching my
        herb in my car?

309
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:48,780
    -You fucking leaf thief!
    -I wasn't!

310
00:15:48,782 --> 00:15:52,216
- Have you lost your
     fucking mind, Judy?

311
00:15:55,221 --> 00:15:55,620
             Uh...

312
00:15:55,622 --> 00:15:58,256
Jude so hates
     my guts, doesn't he?

313
00:15:58,558 --> 00:16:03,761
     And I came here to be
     friends and as usual
     I've screwed it up.

314
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:06,130
             No.

315
00:16:06,398 --> 00:16:07,999
 Jude's actually really sweet.

316
00:16:08,001 --> 00:16:10,668
     He just doesn't like
     to show it.

317
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:14,439
     Something tells me
     you're the sweet one.

318
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:21,412
         What's this?

319
00:16:21,414 --> 00:16:23,715
     Oh, it's um, it's a
     token for the subway.

320
00:16:23,717 --> 00:16:25,650
--Get out!

321
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:28,686
     Yeah, uh, my brother
     gave it to me.

322
00:16:28,688 --> 00:16:30,254
 It's supposed to be good luck.

323
00:16:30,256 --> 00:16:32,390
I'm sure.

324
00:16:33,926 --> 00:16:36,594
     Hey, can I ask
     like a weird favor?

325
00:16:36,596 --> 00:16:37,829
            Depends.

326
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:41,632
  If I gave you his address,
  could you go see him

327
00:16:41,634 --> 00:16:44,335
    and get him to call me?
    He doesn't have a phone.

328
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:47,638
        Are you Indian?

329
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,040
             What?

330
00:16:49,042 --> 00:16:50,675
         Uh, yeah...

331
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:51,509
             Half.

332
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:54,579
    Uh, Gandhi not Geronimo.

333
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,915
      You have the most
      amazing eyelashes.

334
00:16:58,217 --> 00:17:01,119
     Like the women in the
     Bollywood movies.

335
00:17:01,121 --> 00:17:02,553
          Thank you.

336
00:17:10,662 --> 00:17:11,996
             There.

337
00:17:11,998 --> 00:17:13,531
     I like that better.

338
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:14,565
 Oh, it doesn't matter to me.

339
00:17:14,567 --> 00:17:18,403
 I can't see anything anyway.
 My contact fell out.

340
00:17:19,438 --> 00:17:20,972
        And where is it?

341
00:17:21,306 --> 00:17:22,740
         In my hand.

342
00:17:28,981 --> 00:17:31,049
  Wait, what are you doing?

343
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:33,184
     I'm getting it moist.

344
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:35,386
          Come here.

345
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:40,358
        Which eye is it?

346
00:17:50,702 --> 00:17:52,070
          Is it in?

347
00:17:52,871 --> 00:17:54,238
          Think so.

348
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,340
        I think so too.

349
00:18:21,066 --> 00:18:22,867
        Oh! Oh, my God.

350
00:18:29,508 --> 00:18:31,142
          Oh, fuck.

351
00:18:32,978 --> 00:18:33,277
             Ahhh!

352
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:37,381
Three, two, one,
     Happy New Year!

353
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:41,752
Jude!

354
00:18:42,054 --> 00:18:44,989
Jude!
    -I'm fucking over here!

355
00:18:45,657 --> 00:18:46,891
             Jesus!

356
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:50,528
         You okay, man?

357
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:52,897
          -Untie me.
          -Jesus.

358
00:18:52,899 --> 00:18:53,798
         What happened?

359
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,900
    -Oh, shit!
    -What the fuck happened?

360
00:18:55,902 --> 00:18:56,934
         Oh, my God!

361
00:18:56,936 --> 00:18:58,469
     Let me get this out.

362
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:13,451
     Where were you guys
     all that time?

363
00:19:13,453 --> 00:19:15,686
 Uh, just, you know, talking.

364
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:18,789
 Did she say anything about me?

365
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:19,991
            No. No.

366
00:19:19,993 --> 00:19:22,827
     Just that maybe
     that you hated her.

367
00:19:23,428 --> 00:19:25,196
      I don't hate her.

368
00:19:25,198 --> 00:19:28,032
      This whole night
      is just fucked up.

369
00:19:29,034 --> 00:19:30,801
     Pretty pissed, huh?

370
00:19:49,788 --> 00:19:51,422
Sure you okay?

371
00:19:51,957 --> 00:19:53,357
Yes.

372
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:56,894
 We can begin with the panties
 again if you want, man.

373
00:19:57,462 --> 00:20:00,598
     No, I have a better idea.
     Come here.

374
00:20:05,137 --> 00:20:07,471
What are you doing?

375
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:09,807
         Freon, dude.

376
00:20:09,809 --> 00:20:11,542
          It's free.

377
00:20:13,145 --> 00:20:15,546
    You sure you know
    what you're doing, man?

378
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:17,348
  Yes, I've done it before.

379
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:19,383
 I kind of just wanna go home.

380
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:20,918
            -Jude...
            -Jesus!

381
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,653
     Stop being a pussy.

382
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:26,324
         You owe me.

383
00:20:30,028 --> 00:20:31,295
             Okay.

384
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:34,799
             Okay.

385
00:20:36,501 --> 00:20:38,603
     I think we're good.

386
00:20:57,856 --> 00:20:59,590
         Dude, dude!

387
00:21:01,493 --> 00:21:02,860
            Take it!

388
00:21:03,963 --> 00:21:04,962
             Oh!

389
00:21:04,964 --> 00:21:07,331
Oh, my God!

390
00:21:12,804 --> 00:21:13,738
             Oh!

391
00:21:24,417 --> 00:21:25,916
      Happy New Year's.

392
00:21:25,918 --> 00:21:27,551
         You're a dick.

393
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:30,888
         -It felt good.
         -Oh, shit!

394
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:56,514
Hey.

395
00:21:56,516 --> 00:21:59,717
     What the hell are you
     two doing out here?

396
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:05,156
             Jude!

397
00:22:07,459 --> 00:22:08,693
             Jude!

398
00:22:10,362 --> 00:22:11,996
          You okay?

399
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:14,532
         Are you okay?

400
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,767
         What is it?

401
00:22:20,572 --> 00:22:22,406
         Oh, my God!

402
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:24,041
          Oh, Teddy.

403
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:26,711
     Teddy, wake up, honey!

404
00:22:27,045 --> 00:22:29,146
 Teddy, Teddy, honey, wake up!

405
00:22:29,148 --> 00:22:30,381
             Teddy!

406
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:32,316
    Stay here, I'm gonna...

407
00:22:32,318 --> 00:22:34,719
      Don't move. Jude,
      don't move, okay?

408
00:22:34,721 --> 00:22:35,686
         Don't move.

409
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:39,056
      I'm gonna call an
      ambulance.

410
00:23:00,445 --> 00:23:02,313
Jude.

411
00:23:29,941 --> 00:23:33,177
<i> And a happy</i>
 <i> New Year's Day, New York.</i>

412
00:23:33,179 --> 00:23:37,415
    <i> Here's to your hangover</i>
    <i> with this classic</i>
    <i> from Traffic.</i>

413
00:24:03,175 --> 00:24:04,675
         Jesus Christ.

414
00:24:10,515 --> 00:24:12,149
         Lester's pad.

415
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:15,953
         Hey, Harriet.

416
00:24:15,955 --> 00:24:16,887
         How'd it go?

417
00:24:16,889 --> 00:24:18,722
    You and Eliza have fun?

418
00:24:18,857 --> 00:24:21,225
      Whoa, whoa, whoa,
      whoa, whoa, what?

419
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:23,694
What? Who?

420
00:24:29,935 --> 00:24:31,101
         Oh, my God!

421
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:38,309
     What you want, baby?
     I got what you need.

422
00:24:53,558 --> 00:24:55,459
Who are you
        looking for?

423
00:24:59,264 --> 00:25:01,565
    I'm looking for Johnny.

424
00:25:01,567 --> 00:25:03,634
  His brother Teddy sent me.

425
00:25:05,103 --> 00:25:06,537
     You just found him.

426
00:25:06,539 --> 00:25:08,472
     You want a cigarette?

427
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:11,041
     No, I'm Straight Edge
     and Krishna.

428
00:25:11,877 --> 00:25:13,110
             Wow.

429
00:25:13,245 --> 00:25:15,646
      That's, uh, quite
      a double bill.

430
00:25:15,648 --> 00:25:16,480
      Well, not really.

431
00:25:16,482 --> 00:25:19,016
     They complement
     each other perfectly.

432
00:25:19,018 --> 00:25:22,753
 Clean living, transformation,
 and transcendence.

433
00:25:23,088 --> 00:25:23,721
     It's funny you, uh,

434
00:25:23,723 --> 00:25:27,258
 having a brother that's like
 completely opposite you.

435
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:30,995
 We have different fathers but
 we're more alike than we look.

436
00:25:30,997 --> 00:25:35,032
  Yeah, I don't really even
  know him that well.
  We just met actually.

437
00:25:35,034 --> 00:25:37,201
     So, you got no phone
     in your place?

438
00:25:37,203 --> 00:25:40,871
  I've got no nothing in my
  place. I'm squatting.

439
00:25:41,406 --> 00:25:42,473
Rise and shine, Louie.

440
00:25:42,475 --> 00:25:44,141
Need to use the phone.

441
00:25:44,143 --> 00:25:45,643
      All right, Johnny.

442
00:25:46,578 --> 00:25:49,446
     -Jesus, you all right?
     -Yeah, thanks, man.

443
00:26:02,494 --> 00:26:03,494
             Mom?

444
00:26:03,496 --> 00:26:05,396
     What are you home now?

445
00:26:05,463 --> 00:26:07,565
 Where the hell have you been?

446
00:26:09,034 --> 00:26:10,267
             What?

447
00:26:14,973 --> 00:26:17,274
<i> What the</i>
     <i> fuck are you saying?</i>

448
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:26,183
    <i> This is all your fault.</i>

449
00:26:26,651 --> 00:26:27,785
    This is all your fault.

450
00:26:27,787 --> 00:26:29,286
      You fucking cunt!

451
00:26:33,491 --> 00:26:37,561
    For the Lord does not
    abandon anyone forever.

452
00:26:37,563 --> 00:26:41,932
      The book of Jude
      tells us that when
      Christ reappears,

453
00:26:41,934 --> 00:26:43,167
     he will not be alone.

454
00:26:43,169 --> 00:26:47,705
     But instead surrounded
     by 10,000 saints.

455
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:50,941
     Let us take comfort
     in knowing that today

456
00:26:50,943 --> 00:26:55,079
     <i> this number becomes</i>
     <i> 10,001.</i>

457
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:03,020
Who's "TM"?

458
00:27:03,421 --> 00:27:05,289
     Just a boy who died.

459
00:27:18,204 --> 00:27:19,470
             Jude!

460
00:27:20,238 --> 00:27:23,040
Is he ever
    gonna go back to school?

461
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:53,904
             Hey.

462
00:27:54,806 --> 00:27:56,040
            It's me!

463
00:28:00,278 --> 00:28:01,679
Whoo!

464
00:28:03,948 --> 00:28:05,282
  I hope I didn't alarm you.

465
00:28:05,284 --> 00:28:08,352
 I just thought maybe
 it'd be good if we had a few,

466
00:28:08,354 --> 00:28:11,755
  few seconds before the
  girls knew I'm here, huh.

467
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:14,091
Nice.

468
00:28:14,093 --> 00:28:16,160
      What the fuck are
      you doing here?

469
00:28:16,162 --> 00:28:17,828
     Come to kidnap you.

470
00:28:18,496 --> 00:28:21,065
     What did you...
     What's with your hair?

471
00:28:21,067 --> 00:28:22,232
             Huh?

472
00:28:26,337 --> 00:28:30,274
    I'm sorry about your
    buddy, Teddy, you know.

473
00:28:30,341 --> 00:28:31,108
     You hardly knew him.

474
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:33,744
     Yeah, but I'm still
     sorry, you know.

475
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:40,417
     You got weed in here?

476
00:28:41,019 --> 00:28:41,418
             Maybe.

477
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:42,953
      Maybe. Come on,
      don't bullshit me.

478
00:28:42,955 --> 00:28:44,788
         Where is it?
         Let me see it.

479
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:53,063
             Mmm.

480
00:28:58,169 --> 00:29:00,104
Ugh!

481
00:29:00,106 --> 00:29:02,706
      Where did you get
      this ditch weed?

482
00:29:02,708 --> 00:29:03,407
         I stole it.

483
00:29:03,409 --> 00:29:05,476
     Yeah, well stealing's
     not cool, Jude.

484
00:29:05,478 --> 00:29:07,177
     It's not cool at all.
     All right?

485
00:29:07,179 --> 00:29:11,448
    From now on, you're only
    smoking your dad's shit.

486
00:29:13,118 --> 00:29:14,351
             Phew!

487
00:29:16,621 --> 00:29:20,791
     What did you mean when
     you said you were here
         to kidnap me?

488
00:29:20,793 --> 00:29:22,493
      I'm rescuing you.

489
00:29:22,495 --> 00:29:23,861
 Taking you to the Big Apple.

490
00:29:23,863 --> 00:29:25,229
 And why would I go with you?

491
00:29:25,231 --> 00:29:27,898
      I'm offering you
      Manhattan, champ.

492
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:29,900
    Don't play hard to get.

493
00:29:32,203 --> 00:29:34,104
 Would I have to go to school?

494
00:29:34,106 --> 00:29:35,239
          Afraid so.

495
00:29:35,241 --> 00:29:37,341
     Well, fuck that.
     I'm never going back.

496
00:29:37,343 --> 00:29:39,476
     Except for, I mean,
     driver's ed, but...

497
00:29:39,478 --> 00:29:41,078
     Okay, New York public
     schools blow anyway.

498
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:41,845
 You're safer on the street.

499
00:29:41,847 --> 00:29:43,347
    But you're gonna have to
    have gainful employment

500
00:29:43,349 --> 00:29:45,549
      and promise not
      to tell your mom.

501
00:29:46,684 --> 00:29:48,452
     When will we leave?

502
00:29:49,721 --> 00:29:51,321
      Tomorrow morning.

503
00:29:51,723 --> 00:29:54,725
    Don't you just feel the
    bad vibes in this place?

504
00:29:54,727 --> 00:29:55,793
          Seriously.

505
00:29:55,795 --> 00:29:57,361
    Pack up your shit, huh?

506
00:29:57,363 --> 00:29:59,329
        I'm gonna go say
        hi to your mom.

507
00:29:59,331 --> 00:30:00,731
     Good talking to you.

508
00:30:00,733 --> 00:30:03,000
    You know what? Fuck you!

509
00:30:04,836 --> 00:30:05,135
             Uh...

510
00:30:05,137 --> 00:30:08,539
 -Hey, hold on a second.
 -Prudence, my baby girl, hi!

511
00:30:09,274 --> 00:30:11,308
- Um...

512
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:12,509
    What are you doing here?

513
00:30:12,511 --> 00:30:13,143
         Look at you.

514
00:30:13,145 --> 00:30:16,947
      Growing up into
      a stone-cold fox.

515
00:30:17,115 --> 00:30:19,950
     Uh, I'll be off in a
     couple of secs, okay?

516
00:30:19,952 --> 00:30:21,952
     Yeah, I'm back. Sorry.

517
00:30:22,353 --> 00:30:24,955
    No, that, yeah,
    that's what I'm saying.

518
00:30:27,292 --> 00:30:28,225
            Mmm-hmm.

519
00:30:38,871 --> 00:30:41,171
- Mmm...

520
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,073
         Hello, Les.

521
00:30:43,075 --> 00:30:45,275
         -Remember me?
         -Yeah, hello.

522
00:30:45,277 --> 00:30:46,643
 How long have you been here?

523
00:30:46,645 --> 00:30:47,845
    Damn you look good, huh.

524
00:30:47,847 --> 00:30:51,248
 Long enough to have a
 successful father-son reunion.

525
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:53,450
     -Really? It went well?
     -Yeah, yeah.
     No, it went great.

526
00:30:53,452 --> 00:30:54,852
     We're gonna leave in
     the morning.

527
00:30:54,854 --> 00:30:58,355
 I figure you might make us
 something delicious, you know?

528
00:30:58,357 --> 00:30:59,957
      And then, maybe I
      crash with you?

529
00:30:59,959 --> 00:31:01,191
     -Oh, really?
     -For the night, yeah.

530
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:03,093
    -Is that the plan?
    -That's the plan, yeah.

531
00:31:03,095 --> 00:31:05,229
  Thinking you wouldn't have
  worn that patchouli,

532
00:31:05,231 --> 00:31:09,566
- if you didn't want a little  bit of Lester.
-   -Come on!

533
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:11,001
         Stop, please!

534
00:31:24,148 --> 00:31:25,382
             Les.

535
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:28,785
      -Come on, wake up.
      Flashback's over.
      -Mmm...

536
00:31:29,989 --> 00:31:32,055
    I thought we were gonna
    have a lost weekend.

537
00:31:32,057 --> 00:31:32,356
            Oh, no.

538
00:31:32,358 --> 00:31:34,291
  I've had enough of
  those to last a lifetime.

539
00:31:34,293 --> 00:31:35,025
        -One more time.
        -No.

540
00:31:35,027 --> 00:31:36,560
     You have a long road
     ahead of you.

541
00:31:36,562 --> 00:31:38,362
      -Come on, come on.
      -Get up.

542
00:31:38,364 --> 00:31:39,396
        It'll only take
        another second.

543
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:41,231
      Your son is packed
      and ready to go.

544
00:31:41,233 --> 00:31:43,800
      Harriet, come on,
      come on, come on.

545
00:31:43,802 --> 00:31:44,701
             Baby.

546
00:32:42,093 --> 00:32:42,960
    This place is a shoebox.

547
00:32:42,962 --> 00:32:45,262
     Yeah, well it's a rent
     controlled shoebox.

548
00:32:45,264 --> 00:32:49,900
    I got it off this lady
    friend of mine who went
     back to her husband.

549
00:32:49,902 --> 00:32:53,870
  The one you got pregnant
  and left your family for?

550
00:32:53,872 --> 00:32:55,772
            Uh, no.

551
00:32:55,774 --> 00:32:56,707
        A different one.

552
00:32:56,709 --> 00:32:59,676
      She never had that
      kid, by the way.

553
00:32:59,744 --> 00:33:01,311
    What about Eliza's mom?

554
00:33:01,446 --> 00:33:03,747
      Did you break up
      that marriage too?

555
00:33:03,749 --> 00:33:04,381
            Uh, no.

556
00:33:04,383 --> 00:33:08,885
    Eliza's dad dropped dead
    of a heart attack when
    she was about...

557
00:33:09,253 --> 00:33:09,553
             Three.

558
00:33:09,555 --> 00:33:13,223
  He was some kind of fancy
  pants lawyer I think.

559
00:33:13,225 --> 00:33:14,858
         Eliza's dad,

560
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:15,859
             Teddy,

561
00:33:15,861 --> 00:33:17,828
    the almost-Donahue kid.

562
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:21,264
 It's almost as easy to not
 be here as it is to be here.

563
00:33:21,266 --> 00:33:22,165
      Yeah, pretty much.

564
00:33:22,167 --> 00:33:24,201
     Okay, I cleaned this
     off for you.

565
00:33:24,203 --> 00:33:26,303
  Okay, this is your domain.

566
00:33:26,305 --> 00:33:27,304
            No pets.

567
00:33:27,306 --> 00:33:29,406
    Otherwise anything goes.

568
00:33:30,108 --> 00:33:33,944
 How about a little
 pack-a-lolo before unpacking?

569
00:33:33,946 --> 00:33:35,312
             Hmm?

570
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:37,280
     -That's fine with me.
     -Yeah?

571
00:33:37,282 --> 00:33:40,384
     This is one of your
     mother's finest.

572
00:33:40,386 --> 00:33:41,385
     I call her Gertrude.

573
00:33:41,387 --> 00:33:44,388
     "Hamlet, cast thy
     knighted color off."

574
00:33:45,691 --> 00:33:47,090
    I guess you can see why

575
00:33:47,092 --> 00:33:49,659
    Eliza's mom won't spend
    time here, huh?

576
00:33:49,661 --> 00:33:51,261
 Would you hold this for a sec?

577
00:33:51,263 --> 00:33:53,597
      It's all part
      of my master plan.

578
00:33:53,599 --> 00:33:58,235
     These are tips that
     you need to learn on
     your way to manhood.

579
00:33:58,237 --> 00:34:03,106
 Truthfully you'll probably be
 pulling a lot of ass now
 that you're a New Yorker.

580
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:05,642
     Did I already tell you
     that I have a handgun?

581
00:34:05,644 --> 00:34:06,643
        You're serious?

582
00:34:06,645 --> 00:34:07,511
         Yeah, yeah.
         .38 Special,

583
00:34:07,513 --> 00:34:09,179
    it's right underneath
    the kitchen sink there.

584
00:34:09,181 --> 00:34:11,615
    His name's McQueen,
    but don't ever touch it,

585
00:34:11,617 --> 00:34:12,983
     unless I tell you to.

586
00:34:12,985 --> 00:34:13,917
  Why would you tell me to?

587
00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:17,454
  I guess we should probably
  talk about curfew, right?

588
00:34:17,456 --> 00:34:18,722
         What curfew?

589
00:34:18,724 --> 00:34:19,022
            Exactly.

590
00:34:19,024 --> 00:34:21,124
  As long as you demonstrate
  that you are somewhat

591
00:34:21,126 --> 00:34:23,393
     in control of your
     faculties, all right?

592
00:34:23,395 --> 00:34:26,830
 As long as you return at night
 from wherever it is you go,

593
00:34:26,832 --> 00:34:30,367
     I am willing to forgo
     any curfew.

594
00:34:30,369 --> 00:34:32,469
  Is Mom cool with all this?

595
00:34:32,471 --> 00:34:34,004
 If you stay out of trouble,

596
00:34:34,006 --> 00:34:34,938
    your mother doesn't need
    to know everything.

597
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:39,109
  She seems to be of the
  opinion that this is some
  kind of rehab clinic.

598
00:34:39,111 --> 00:34:42,045
    Which it clearly is not.

599
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:52,255
         Understood?

600
00:34:54,325 --> 00:34:55,759
         Understood.

601
00:34:55,761 --> 00:34:57,094
        Glad to hear it.

602
00:35:14,145 --> 00:35:15,712
Eliza!

603
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:18,915
     I've got good news.

604
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:19,983
     Les' son is in town,

605
00:35:19,985 --> 00:35:21,017
     and we're all having
     dinner tonight,

606
00:35:21,019 --> 00:35:24,654
 which is, you know, I...
 I think's a really good thing.

607
00:35:24,656 --> 00:35:26,656
      I'm in the shower.

608
00:35:30,595 --> 00:35:34,097
You see, Diane used to be
 a world-class ballerina.

609
00:35:34,099 --> 00:35:35,866
     And the thing about
     ballerinas is,

610
00:35:35,868 --> 00:35:37,968
     when they're dancing,
     they do a ton of blow.

611
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:41,471
  And when they're retired,
  they smoke a ton of grass.

612
00:35:41,473 --> 00:35:42,706
  So that's how you met her?

613
00:35:42,708 --> 00:35:46,376
 Yeah, well, no, actually I was
 dating her friend first...

614
00:35:46,378 --> 00:35:47,777
             Hello.

615
00:35:47,779 --> 00:35:49,546
          Thank you.

616
00:35:51,449 --> 00:35:54,451
  Hi. We have a table for...

617
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,554
         Oh, hey, hey!

618
00:35:58,122 --> 00:35:59,256
          Ladies...

619
00:35:59,258 --> 00:36:01,525
Hi.
Come and join us
 for a drink.

620
00:36:01,527 --> 00:36:03,760
- Look at you.
- Hi.

621
00:36:03,762 --> 00:36:05,562
         How are you?

622
00:36:05,897 --> 00:36:07,197
             Jude!

623
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:09,432
Well, we're all
     just so thrilled

624
00:36:09,434 --> 00:36:13,069
  you're here with us in
  New York, aren't we Eliza?

625
00:36:14,105 --> 00:36:14,671
Eliza, come on,

626
00:36:14,673 --> 00:36:16,273
  you've been whining about
  meeting my kids forever

627
00:36:16,275 --> 00:36:20,210
     and now one of them
     finally materializes
     and you check out.

628
00:36:20,212 --> 00:36:22,112
 I'm not checking out, okay?

629
00:36:23,047 --> 00:36:25,282
     How do you like it
     so far in New York?

630
00:36:25,284 --> 00:36:27,017
    Oh, it's so much better
    than Vermont.

631
00:36:27,019 --> 00:36:29,219
--And the music's great too.

632
00:36:29,221 --> 00:36:31,555
     And what kind of music
     do you listen to?

633
00:36:31,557 --> 00:36:33,190
        Hardcore mostly.

634
00:36:33,192 --> 00:36:34,891
         Hardcore...

635
00:36:34,893 --> 00:36:37,561
 Is that one you know, Eliza?

636
00:36:37,563 --> 00:36:38,528
        Eliza knows it.

637
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:40,830
    And she even saw
    The Misfits in concert.

638
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:41,464
         Right, Dad?

639
00:36:41,466 --> 00:36:44,034
And what does
     it sound like?

640
00:36:44,268 --> 00:36:47,070
      Um, have you ever
      heard of punk?

641
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:48,905
  Darling, I'm from England.

642
00:36:48,907 --> 00:36:50,140
 What do you mean,
 The Clash, the Sex Pistols?

643
00:36:50,142 --> 00:36:54,311
 It's kind of, but a
 huge scene in New York
 right now is Straight Edge,

644
00:36:54,313 --> 00:36:57,280
     which basically means
     no drinking, no drugs,

645
00:36:57,282 --> 00:37:00,884
      and, uh, just not
      being promiscuous.

646
00:37:00,886 --> 00:37:03,186
     In the old days we
     called that "square."

647
00:37:03,188 --> 00:37:04,988
I'm not square, Dad.
 -Yeah, well...

648
00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:07,390
     -Some of them are
     recovering addicts.
     -Mmm-hmm.

649
00:37:07,392 --> 00:37:10,327
    Some of them have
    parents who are addicts.

650
00:37:13,298 --> 00:37:15,131
    Well, do you know what,
    I think that sounds

651
00:37:15,133 --> 00:37:18,568
 like a fabulous organization,
 don't you, Eliza?

652
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:20,837
      Fabulous, darling.

653
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:22,372
Eliza.

654
00:37:22,673 --> 00:37:25,342
 Teddy's brother is in a really
 popular Straight Edge band.

655
00:37:25,344 --> 00:37:26,776
    -Is he?
    -I'm trying to find out
    where he lives.

656
00:37:26,778 --> 00:37:30,046
 Well, that shouldn't be
 too difficult, doesn't his
 mother know where he lives?

657
00:37:30,048 --> 00:37:32,282
Oh, his
     mother's nice but...
She's crazy.

658
00:37:32,284 --> 00:37:35,385
Off her rocker, yeah,
  that too, right?

659
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:37,420
Do you have, um,
     some more sake?

660
00:37:37,422 --> 00:37:40,991
Yes, I'm dying for some
 more sake. Let's get some
 immediately.

661
00:37:40,993 --> 00:37:44,561
 Excuse me, hi, could we have
 another large sake, please?

662
00:37:44,563 --> 00:37:45,895
  You have Johnny's address?

663
00:37:45,897 --> 00:37:48,465
 That's right by us. I mean,
 it's a fourth tier hell,

664
00:37:48,467 --> 00:37:50,333
     but I'll take you over
     there if you want.

665
00:37:50,335 --> 00:37:52,168
This is Teddy's
     handwriting.

666
00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:53,336
     How'd you get this?

667
00:37:53,338 --> 00:37:55,038
     Yes, how did you get
     that, darling?

668
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:58,675
Excuse me, I need
  to use the restroom.

669
00:38:26,437 --> 00:38:29,205
Feels weird that she
  got to Johnny's before me.

670
00:38:29,207 --> 00:38:30,774
Yeah, but now I
     get to show you.

671
00:38:30,776 --> 00:38:32,409
    I'm the best tour guide
    in the world, man.

672
00:38:32,411 --> 00:38:36,146
  I'll tell you everything
    there is to know about
  this lovely little hamlet

673
00:38:36,148 --> 00:38:38,682
    known as Alphabet City.

674
00:38:38,849 --> 00:38:42,585
    Okay, the A in Avenue A
    stands for, "Asking."

675
00:38:42,587 --> 00:38:44,521
     As in, "You're asking
     for it."

676
00:38:44,523 --> 00:38:48,558
  The B stands for
  "Buddy, watch your back."

677
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:51,394
  The C stands for "Crazy."

678
00:38:51,396 --> 00:38:54,664
    As in, "Are you fucking
    crazy?"

679
00:38:54,666 --> 00:38:57,534
     And D is for "Dude,
     you are dead."

680
00:38:57,536 --> 00:38:58,802
      What, you serious?

681
00:38:58,804 --> 00:38:59,502
    I'm absolutely serious,

682
00:38:59,504 --> 00:39:02,739
 but the road to hell is paved
 with some fun along the way.

683
00:39:02,741 --> 00:39:05,275
 Like check this out, right,
 you see this right here?

684
00:39:05,277 --> 00:39:06,710
    -Does that ring a bell?
    -Not really.

685
00:39:06,712 --> 00:39:09,145
  Album cover to Led Zeppelin's
 <i> Physical Graffiti.</i>

686
00:39:09,147 --> 00:39:10,380
      -Oh, shit!
      -Yeah, yeah, yeah.

687
00:39:10,382 --> 00:39:12,849
 You got Lenny Bruce's
 apartment somewhere down here

688
00:39:12,851 --> 00:39:14,517
     and Abbie Hoffman was
     somewhere up here.

689
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:17,721
 Back a block, you got the most
 famous bathhouse in the world.

690
00:39:17,723 --> 00:39:19,556
 -Bathhouse?
 -Yeah, it's like a place where

691
00:39:19,558 --> 00:39:22,792
 dudes like to soap each other
 up and get crazy, you know.

692
00:39:22,794 --> 00:39:23,360
That's gross.

693
00:39:23,362 --> 00:39:26,529
 Yeah, that's what the city
 thought too, that's why they
 shut it down, man.

694
00:39:26,531 --> 00:39:29,165
 AIDS is changing everything
 around here.

695
00:39:31,503 --> 00:39:33,236
Look how lucky
     we are, you know?

696
00:39:33,238 --> 00:39:37,073
    World-renowned Tompkins
    Square Park is right
    outside our door.

697
00:39:37,075 --> 00:39:39,075
Doesn't look,
     uh, very park-like.

698
00:39:39,077 --> 00:39:40,877
You sound like
  all the yuppies

699
00:39:40,879 --> 00:39:44,381
 who want to get the homeless
 out of here and make it
 look pretty.

700
00:39:44,383 --> 00:39:45,315
 Like that's going to happen.

701
00:39:45,317 --> 00:39:48,752
 Well, don't be so sure, champ,
 money's got a big mouth.

702
00:39:48,754 --> 00:39:52,055
    All right, this is you,
    this is your block.

703
00:39:52,057 --> 00:39:53,223
 Should be right down there.

704
00:39:53,225 --> 00:39:57,460
    Yeah, but this is about
    as far as I'll go,
    it's too dangerous.

705
00:39:58,229 --> 00:39:59,262
      Well, thanks, Dad.

706
00:39:59,264 --> 00:40:00,463
 Don't worry, you'll be fine.

707
00:40:00,465 --> 00:40:02,499
         -Thanks a lot.
         -Okay.

708
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:08,972
        Jude, run! Run!

709
00:40:12,676 --> 00:40:14,210
    Keep running, white boy.

710
00:40:15,012 --> 00:40:16,646
Fuck you!

711
00:40:32,097 --> 00:40:37,901
  Hey, Johnny, it's, uh...
  It's Jude, Teddy's friend.

712
00:40:38,202 --> 00:40:40,970
 I just moved here with my dad.

713
00:40:40,972 --> 00:40:44,641
    Thought you know, uh...

714
00:40:45,075 --> 00:40:47,844
      You made it out
      of Vermont, buddy.

715
00:40:47,846 --> 00:40:49,379
        Come here, man.

716
00:40:50,214 --> 00:40:54,083
 It's like a little piece of
 Teddy just walked in my door.

717
00:40:58,289 --> 00:40:59,756
         Guys, guys.

718
00:40:59,758 --> 00:41:00,857
      Meet Jude K-Horn.

719
00:41:00,859 --> 00:41:06,596
 He's a kid from my old hood
 who just relocated to live
  with his drug-dealer dad.

720
00:41:06,598 --> 00:41:08,465
     He was my brother's
     best friend.

721
00:41:08,467 --> 00:41:10,300
 It says everything about him.

722
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:12,335
Hey.

723
00:41:12,337 --> 00:41:14,037
        -Hey, what's up.
        -Hey, man.

724
00:41:14,039 --> 00:41:15,405
        Here, sit down.

725
00:41:15,706 --> 00:41:17,640
  -Cool dragon tattoo, man.
  -Thanks.

726
00:41:17,642 --> 00:41:20,210
 Yeah, Johnny's masterpiece.

727
00:41:20,212 --> 00:41:23,913
     He's an artist with a
     needle or a sharpie.

728
00:41:25,516 --> 00:41:28,318
    So, uh, Jude, tell me...

729
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:34,023
 Word is that daddy's weed is
 pretty out-of-this-world, huh?

730
00:41:34,025 --> 00:41:36,059
  Yeah, no, it's incredible.

731
00:41:36,061 --> 00:41:36,626
Oh, excellent.

732
00:41:36,628 --> 00:41:42,098
 How long do you plan to exist
 in the greatest city in the
 world like a fucked up zombie?

733
00:41:42,733 --> 00:41:44,200
         Indefinitely?

734
00:41:45,937 --> 00:41:46,402
          Gentlemen.

735
00:41:46,404 --> 00:41:51,975
     Army of One has just
     inherited their first
     official charity case.

736
00:41:51,977 --> 00:41:53,409
             -Whoo!
             -Yeah!

737
00:41:55,145 --> 00:41:55,812
        Oh, whoa, wait.

738
00:41:55,814 --> 00:41:57,380
     -What are you doing?
     -Well, you still play,
     don't you?

739
00:41:57,382 --> 00:42:00,783
 -I mean, a little, but...
 -Yeah, okay, let's see what
 you got, Vermont.

740
00:42:00,785 --> 00:42:04,787
  We'll start at the basics.
  Minor Threat.

741
00:42:57,609 --> 00:43:00,810
     Darling, do you like
     this shade of red?

742
00:43:01,947 --> 00:43:06,082
 Just bought it at Saks and
 I'm not sure it's my color.

743
00:43:06,084 --> 00:43:08,251
         -Looks fine.
         -Really?

744
00:43:10,621 --> 00:43:12,355
    We've got to go shopping
    when I get back.

745
00:43:12,357 --> 00:43:15,925
    They've got some really
    cute new things for
    spring, you know.

746
00:43:15,927 --> 00:43:17,327
             Right.

747
00:43:19,563 --> 00:43:21,364
    Okay, darling, well the
    car's downstairs.

748
00:43:21,366 --> 00:43:25,735
 I'm only going to be at
 this silly dance conference
 for three nights.

749
00:43:27,972 --> 00:43:31,674
  All my contact info is on
  the fridge, Nina's here.

750
00:43:31,676 --> 00:43:33,242
    -Curfew's at 9:00, okay?
    -Mmm-hmm.

751
00:43:33,244 --> 00:43:35,278
    And Les is around if you
    need him for anything.

752
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,413
     I love you.
     I'm going to miss you.

753
00:43:37,415 --> 00:43:40,183
     -You won't be lonely,
     will you?
     -No.

754
00:43:41,185 --> 00:43:45,521
    All right, sweetie, call
    me anytime, okay?

755
00:43:45,589 --> 00:43:47,056
          Have fun.

756
00:44:17,521 --> 00:44:19,055
        Your bag, miss.

757
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:21,157
     -I'm sorry?
     -Your handbag, miss.

758
00:44:21,159 --> 00:44:24,494
     -I'm just... I'm just
     going in here.
     -It's policy.

759
00:44:32,369 --> 00:44:35,672
 Fine, I'll just... I'll just
 go leave it in the car then.

760
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:04,067
             Hey.

761
00:45:07,137 --> 00:45:08,738
             Hey.

762
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:12,675
It feels weird that we
 haven't hung out, you know?

763
00:45:12,677 --> 00:45:16,012
Yeah, I know. I've
  been kind of preoccupied.

764
00:45:16,014 --> 00:45:19,482
 Well, I'm psyched you want
 to check out Johnny's matinee.

765
00:45:22,986 --> 00:45:24,587
     You seem so different.

766
00:45:24,589 --> 00:45:26,122
      What do you mean?

767
00:45:26,124 --> 00:45:27,457
         More serious.

768
00:45:27,459 --> 00:45:30,359
  Well, look, I think I know
  how to change that.

769
00:45:30,361 --> 00:45:31,994
        Check this out.

770
00:45:32,329 --> 00:45:33,629
         What is that?

771
00:45:33,631 --> 00:45:35,164
         It's shrooms.

772
00:45:35,166 --> 00:45:36,199
     I thought it'd be fun.

773
00:45:36,201 --> 00:45:38,735
     And Johnny mentioned
     something about going
     to a Krishna temple,

774
00:45:38,737 --> 00:45:42,071
 which could be, like,
 seriously trippy, you know?

775
00:45:42,073 --> 00:45:44,674
    I thought you were going
    whole-hog Straight Edge

776
00:45:44,676 --> 00:45:47,076
     with the new haircut
     and all, no?

777
00:45:47,078 --> 00:45:49,345
 I just say that to bug my dad.

778
00:45:49,347 --> 00:45:52,081
      I'm mainly into it
      for the music.

779
00:45:52,083 --> 00:45:53,449
    Well, I don't want any.

780
00:45:53,451 --> 00:45:55,284
 Come on, a little won't hurt.

781
00:45:55,286 --> 00:45:57,153
        I said no, Jude!

782
00:45:58,489 --> 00:46:01,357
    How come you would with
    Teddy, but not with me?

783
00:46:01,625 --> 00:46:03,760
     What is that supposed
     to mean?

784
00:46:03,762 --> 00:46:04,393
          You know,

785
00:46:04,395 --> 00:46:06,195
      they found coke in
      his system.

786
00:46:06,197 --> 00:46:08,164
    So I figured, he had to
    have gotten it from you.

787
00:46:08,166 --> 00:46:09,465
    You don't even know what
    you're talking about.

788
00:46:09,467 --> 00:46:12,068
 Why would you say something
 so shitty to me?

789
00:46:12,070 --> 00:46:14,003
    Do you have any idea
    what I'm going through?

790
00:46:14,005 --> 00:46:16,339
     Calm down! I just...
     I just thought...

791
00:46:16,341 --> 00:46:17,173
      You thought what?

792
00:46:17,175 --> 00:46:21,077
     I just... I just
     thought we could party

793
00:46:21,079 --> 00:46:22,345
          a little.

794
00:46:22,347 --> 00:46:24,413
  Like when Teddy was here.

795
00:46:24,548 --> 00:46:29,018
     And maybe it would
     feel like he was still
     with us, you know?

796
00:46:32,723 --> 00:46:34,390
        I'm sorry, Jude.

797
00:46:44,501 --> 00:46:45,701
Yeah!

798
00:47:46,129 --> 00:47:48,331
<i> What's going on?</i>

799
00:47:51,802 --> 00:47:56,505
<i> We're right here</i>
 <i> with you, we're on the train</i>
 <i> going to Brooklyn.</i>

800
00:47:56,507 --> 00:47:58,307
        <i> You'll be fine.</i>

801
00:47:58,309 --> 00:48:00,142
<i> Am I dead?</i>

802
00:48:00,144 --> 00:48:01,811
<i> We're right here</i>
    <i> with you.</i>

803
00:48:01,813 --> 00:48:04,213
<i> Please, God, tell me</i>
 <i> he's going to be okay.</i>

804
00:48:04,215 --> 00:48:06,148
      <i> This can't happen</i>
      <i> to me again,</i>

805
00:48:06,150 --> 00:48:08,084
<i> tell me he's going to be okay.</i>

806
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:10,620
--Am I dead?

807
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:13,089
      -Am I dead?
      -No, you're fine.

808
00:48:13,091 --> 00:48:14,323
      You're all right.

809
00:48:15,493 --> 00:48:16,759
Oh!
      -What is going on?

810
00:48:16,761 --> 00:48:19,128
Listen, you guys are
 both just shrooming out, okay?

811
00:48:19,130 --> 00:48:21,964
    You got trampled on and
    she got paranoid.

812
00:48:21,966 --> 00:48:23,499
  Is this your idea of fun?

813
00:48:23,501 --> 00:48:24,767
     She didn't take any.

814
00:48:24,769 --> 00:48:26,168
     Eliza, are you okay?

815
00:48:26,170 --> 00:48:27,036
What the fuck?

816
00:48:27,038 --> 00:48:29,772
Everything is
     my fault, Jude.

817
00:48:29,774 --> 00:48:33,175
  I'm the one who gave Teddy
  coke, don't you get it?

818
00:48:33,177 --> 00:48:34,844
 That's why I'm being punished.

819
00:48:34,846 --> 00:48:36,412
    No, no, I made him huff

820
00:48:36,414 --> 00:48:38,648
     fucking Freon, okay?

821
00:48:38,650 --> 00:48:41,784
     I'm the one who needs
     to be punished.

822
00:48:41,786 --> 00:48:43,819
            My God!

823
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:47,056
      This isn't about
      punishment, okay?

824
00:48:47,058 --> 00:48:48,824
 I just want to stop it all.

825
00:48:48,826 --> 00:48:53,029
No more drugs,
     no more fucking up.

826
00:48:53,363 --> 00:48:55,564
    Abstinence and restraint

827
00:48:55,566 --> 00:48:56,999
 make one fit for immortality.

828
00:48:57,001 --> 00:49:01,671
 That's what these people
 here believe, that's what
 needs to come out of all this.

829
00:49:01,673 --> 00:49:03,773
 True commitment, all right?

830
00:49:03,775 --> 00:49:05,308
  Commitment from you, Jude.

831
00:49:05,310 --> 00:49:07,076
     -I'm ready to commit.
     -Yeah.

832
00:49:07,078 --> 00:49:08,311
      I'm ready to stop.

833
00:49:08,313 --> 00:49:11,113
        -Eliza?
        -I have to stop.

834
00:49:11,248 --> 00:49:12,982
     Don't you two get it?

835
00:49:12,984 --> 00:49:15,217
     I'm fucking pregnant.

836
00:49:25,762 --> 00:49:26,395
<i> Les.</i>
   -Yeah.

837
00:49:26,397 --> 00:49:29,732
  <i> What's going on? I haven't</i>
  <i> heard from Jude in over</i>
  <i> a week.</i>

838
00:49:29,734 --> 00:49:33,436
<i> Harriet, Harriet, that's</i>
 <i> too much stress, too early.</i>

839
00:49:33,438 --> 00:49:35,604
        It's not healthy
        for you, babe.

840
00:49:35,606 --> 00:49:37,073
     Not healthy at all.

841
00:49:37,075 --> 00:49:38,407
         Put Jude on.

842
00:49:38,409 --> 00:49:40,242
      Hold on, hold on.

843
00:49:42,479 --> 00:49:45,014
     Oh, looks like he's
     up and at 'em.

844
00:49:45,016 --> 00:49:48,317
  It's 7:00. You told me he
  leaves for school at 7:40.

845
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:49,719
- Yeah, well...

846
00:49:49,721 --> 00:49:52,855
  Just hold on one second,
  okay? I got another call.

847
00:49:52,857 --> 00:49:54,423
<i> -Les.</i>

848
00:49:54,425 --> 00:49:55,891
        -Yello?
        -Yeah, I, um...

849
00:49:55,893 --> 00:49:56,892
        I just spoke to
        the housekeeper

850
00:49:56,894 --> 00:49:59,829
 and she told me that Eliza
 was out all night with Jude.

851
00:49:59,831 --> 00:50:03,199
     <i> You do know that she's</i>
     <i> on strict orders to</i>
     <i> be home by 9:00?</i>

852
00:50:03,201 --> 00:50:06,135
     Oh, yeah, well,
     they went to, uh...

853
00:50:06,137 --> 00:50:09,205
  Uh, Johnny's show I guess,
  and it got late.

854
00:50:09,207 --> 00:50:10,439
    Who the hell is Johnny?

855
00:50:10,441 --> 00:50:11,407
     <i> Jude's new best bud.</i>

856
00:50:11,409 --> 00:50:13,743
  You know, he's Mr. Clean,

857
00:50:13,745 --> 00:50:16,245
     brainwashing my kid
     to stay off drugs.

858
00:50:16,247 --> 00:50:17,413
  <i> Just put her on, will you?</i>

859
00:50:17,415 --> 00:50:20,516
    She is there, isn't she?
    That's what she told the
         housekeeper.

860
00:50:20,518 --> 00:50:23,753
      Well, yeah, look,
      she's just, uh...

861
00:50:24,121 --> 00:50:24,687
     She's in the shower

862
00:50:24,689 --> 00:50:26,655
    and so why don't I just
    have her call you back
         in 10, okay?

863
00:50:26,657 --> 00:50:28,724
 Listen, I got somebody else
 on the other line, all right?

864
00:50:28,726 --> 00:50:31,660
     Just hold on, hold on
     one second, yeah.

865
00:50:31,662 --> 00:50:33,729
--That's good.

866
00:50:36,533 --> 00:50:38,434
Should we tell your mom?

867
00:50:38,436 --> 00:50:41,637
She'll just make
    me get an abortion.

868
00:50:41,639 --> 00:50:43,873
    What makes you say that?

869
00:50:44,174 --> 00:50:44,740
    Because she said to me,

870
00:50:44,742 --> 00:50:47,376
"Eliza, darling,
  if you ever get pregnant,

871
00:50:47,378 --> 00:50:50,312
 "you're getting an abortion."

872
00:50:50,514 --> 00:50:53,516
  You know, it's like Teddy
  died that night

873
00:50:54,818 --> 00:50:57,186
        to be born again
        inside you.

874
00:50:57,854 --> 00:51:00,289
     Yeah, that's kind of
     how I feel.

875
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:04,794
 Like it happened for a reason.

876
00:51:06,797 --> 00:51:09,432
     But sometimes I don't
     know how I feel.

877
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:15,137
    "For the soul, there's
    neither birth nor death
     at any given time."

878
00:51:15,405 --> 00:51:17,973
      What is that,
      the Old Testament?

879
00:51:17,975 --> 00:51:19,708
      The Bhagavad Gita.

880
00:51:22,312 --> 00:51:24,080
 Maybe we should tell my dad.

881
00:51:24,082 --> 00:51:25,915
 He'll just tell my mom, Jude.

882
00:51:25,917 --> 00:51:27,850
  We shouldn't tell anybody.

883
00:51:28,385 --> 00:51:30,486
 That way we can control it.

884
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:32,955
  Well, I obviously can't
  keep it a secret forever.

885
00:51:32,957 --> 00:51:37,927
  Yeah, but after a certain
  point, they can't take it
        away from you.

886
00:51:38,728 --> 00:51:40,996
     And where is the baby
     going to live?

887
00:51:40,998 --> 00:51:43,399
    I mean, are you planning
    on staying in school?

888
00:51:43,401 --> 00:51:46,836
      You cross one
      bridge at a time.

889
00:51:50,574 --> 00:51:53,142
At the very least,
    you should see a doctor.

890
00:51:53,443 --> 00:51:55,911
     I'm sure he'll ask to
     see an adult.

891
00:51:55,913 --> 00:51:57,580
  Well, Johnny is an adult.

892
00:51:57,582 --> 00:51:59,215
      From here on out,

893
00:51:59,217 --> 00:52:02,418
    I'm going to be anybody
    Eliza needs me to be.

894
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:06,856
 We're in this together now,
 we're a little family.

895
00:52:06,858 --> 00:52:07,857
         Right, Jude?

896
00:52:09,327 --> 00:52:10,759
Jude!

897
00:52:12,529 --> 00:52:14,396
- Jude!
- Shit!

898
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:17,233
      Okay, okay, okay.

899
00:52:20,670 --> 00:52:25,107
    Jude, we need to discuss
    this whole curfew again.

900
00:52:29,112 --> 00:52:33,249
I thought we had kind
  of a working arrangement.

901
00:52:35,418 --> 00:52:36,852
          You know?

902
00:52:42,092 --> 00:52:43,325
             Huh?

903
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:48,597
 So you're just going to play
 father now and lay a whole
 new set of rules on me?

904
00:52:48,599 --> 00:52:50,366
            No, no.

905
00:52:50,368 --> 00:52:54,403
 I am going to revisit all this

906
00:52:54,405 --> 00:53:00,376
    after I have digested
    my vegan breakfast, eh?

907
00:53:01,678 --> 00:53:05,080
      You know what I'd
      like to know is

908
00:53:05,448 --> 00:53:08,751
     what my girlfriend's
     daughter and my son,

909
00:53:08,753 --> 00:53:13,455
 and some weird Hare Krishna
 dude are all doing together.

910
00:53:14,257 --> 00:53:16,358
  We're just friends, okay?

911
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:17,927
     No, I'm not judging.

912
00:53:17,929 --> 00:53:20,429
     I mean, I met your mom
     at an orgy.

913
00:53:25,001 --> 00:53:28,804
 So tell me, what did you think
 of the show, last night?

914
00:53:29,406 --> 00:53:33,175
  That was last night? Feels
  like 100 years ago.

915
00:53:33,177 --> 00:53:35,177
      I thought you guys
      were really good.

916
00:53:35,179 --> 00:53:37,513
      It's a very weird
      scene though.

917
00:53:37,515 --> 00:53:39,248
         In what way?

918
00:53:39,250 --> 00:53:40,216
        Well, I mean...

919
00:53:40,218 --> 00:53:45,187
 First of all, I might as well
 have been invisible
 to most of the guys there.

920
00:53:45,189 --> 00:53:48,490
 Do I look that disgustingly
 pregnant already?

921
00:53:48,492 --> 00:53:49,758
     No. Don't take that
     personally,

922
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:51,860
      Straight Edge guys
      are different.

923
00:53:51,862 --> 00:53:54,029
     They're not just about
     meeting girls.

924
00:53:54,698 --> 00:53:56,732
     Well, what about you?

925
00:53:57,367 --> 00:53:59,068
         What about me?

926
00:53:59,070 --> 00:54:00,502
     Well, are you gonna...

927
00:54:00,504 --> 00:54:03,305
    Are you gonna wait till
    you're married, or what?

928
00:54:03,307 --> 00:54:05,140
 I mean, that's what the whole
 thing's about, right?

929
00:54:05,142 --> 00:54:08,444
 Not that there is anything
 wrong with it, I'm obviously

930
00:54:08,446 --> 00:54:10,546
    a walking advertisement
    for abstinence.

931
00:54:10,548 --> 00:54:13,382
    What the whole thing is
    all about is community.

932
00:54:13,384 --> 00:54:17,253
  A hardcore family that's
  free from all the bullshit

933
00:54:17,255 --> 00:54:18,721
     that was spoon-fed to
     us by a generation

934
00:54:18,723 --> 00:54:22,124
 that would rather fry their
 brains than purify them.

935
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:24,260
          But I was,

936
00:54:24,262 --> 00:54:27,129
  I was asking specifically
  about you.

937
00:54:27,131 --> 00:54:31,100
     Oh, well, you know,
     I'm committed to the
     Straight Edge life

938
00:54:31,102 --> 00:54:35,204
 but I'm also just as
 red-blooded as the next guy.

939
00:54:35,206 --> 00:54:38,474
     Well, that's a very
     vague answer.

940
00:54:39,442 --> 00:54:44,280
  It's none of my business.
  I don't even know
  why I'm asking.

941
00:54:44,282 --> 00:54:46,215
         Hey, listen...

942
00:54:46,316 --> 00:54:49,385
     I happen to think
     you look really great.

943
00:54:50,153 --> 00:54:51,387
          Thank you.

944
00:54:51,389 --> 00:54:53,188
        And I meant what
        I said before,

945
00:54:53,190 --> 00:54:56,692
    about being anybody that
    you need me to be.

946
00:54:59,462 --> 00:55:00,195
        I know you did.

947
00:55:00,197 --> 00:55:03,832
    Hey, I thought I'd never
    get away from him.

948
00:55:03,834 --> 00:55:05,467
     You didn't tell him
     anything, did you?

949
00:55:05,469 --> 00:55:09,071
  Of course not. I promised
  Eliza I wouldn't.

950
00:55:09,205 --> 00:55:13,342
So when Eliza's mom
 finally finds out about
 our secret,

951
00:55:13,344 --> 00:55:16,645
     I think we should tell
     her I'm the father.

952
00:55:17,013 --> 00:55:17,613
            Why you?

953
00:55:17,615 --> 00:55:20,649
    Well, I'm Teddy's
    brother, so it's blood.

954
00:55:20,651 --> 00:55:22,851
  And I'm also not a minor,
  which you know,

955
00:55:22,853 --> 00:55:25,788
  could help us out in a lot
  of legal situations.

956
00:55:25,790 --> 00:55:26,655
     And, and then what?

957
00:55:26,657 --> 00:55:29,992
 And then we tell her, Eliza
 and I are a committed couple.

958
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:31,927
     Why would we do that?

959
00:55:32,395 --> 00:55:33,896
  'Cause maybe we should be.

960
00:55:33,898 --> 00:55:36,432
 Except for the fact that you
 barely know each other.

961
00:55:36,434 --> 00:55:39,802
 We're already getting to know
 each other, right, Eliza?

962
00:55:39,804 --> 00:55:41,904
  We did have a nice brunch.

963
00:55:41,906 --> 00:55:42,905
             Yeah.

964
00:55:42,907 --> 00:55:45,974
     Anyway, look, nothing
     should get in the way

965
00:55:45,976 --> 00:55:49,712
 of what is in the best
 interest for Teddy's child.

966
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:51,814
          You know.

967
00:55:52,282 --> 00:55:54,149
     This is about love.

968
00:55:55,385 --> 00:56:00,689
     Plus, there's nothing
     not to like about me.

969
00:56:02,992 --> 00:56:04,727
         I got to go.

970
00:56:05,128 --> 00:56:07,496
        -I'll call you.
        -All right.

971
00:56:08,732 --> 00:56:10,366
Spare change?

972
00:56:10,967 --> 00:56:13,769
     She's something, isn't
     she, Uncle Jude?

973
00:57:55,438 --> 00:57:56,738
             Gross!

974
00:57:56,740 --> 00:57:58,974
<i> Mademoiselle</i> Eliza?

975
00:58:03,246 --> 00:58:03,812
      Okay, we're here.

976
00:58:03,814 --> 00:58:08,083
  I agreed, we're on the
  train. You want to tell me
  what's going on?

977
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:12,721
      Eliza's bleeding.

978
00:58:13,323 --> 00:58:15,858
     Bleeding? What kind
     of bleeding?

979
00:58:15,860 --> 00:58:18,961
     You know, like a,
     like a woman bleeding.

980
00:58:18,963 --> 00:58:21,997
 Okay. So what makes you think
 I'm more qualified to deal

981
00:58:21,999 --> 00:58:24,600
     with that situation
     than her mom?

982
00:58:30,306 --> 00:58:32,007
        She's pregnant.

983
00:58:36,579 --> 00:58:38,847
Are you shitting me?

984
00:58:39,716 --> 00:58:40,682
      Jude, what are you
      thinking about?

985
00:58:40,684 --> 00:58:43,819
  You know I got a buttload
  of condoms in my pad.

986
00:58:43,821 --> 00:58:44,987
     It's not mine, Dad.

987
00:58:44,989 --> 00:58:48,056
  And even if it was, you're
  in no position to preach.

988
00:58:48,058 --> 00:58:50,626
    Okay, okay, well who...

989
00:58:51,094 --> 00:58:53,362
  Who's done the deed then?

990
00:58:54,063 --> 00:58:55,197
            Johnny.

991
00:58:55,199 --> 00:58:55,731
            Johnny?

992
00:58:55,733 --> 00:58:58,867
    Why is Johnny not on the
    train going to meet her?

993
00:58:58,869 --> 00:59:00,702
    He doesn't have a phone.

994
00:59:02,305 --> 00:59:03,472
            Perfect.

995
00:59:03,474 --> 00:59:06,475
 You can't tell Diane yet, Dad.

996
00:59:07,410 --> 00:59:09,545
     You have to promise.

997
00:59:13,517 --> 00:59:15,317
<i> In downtown</i>
  <i> Manhattan's Alphabet City,</i>

998
00:59:15,319 --> 00:59:19,955
 <i> tensions continued to rise</i>
    <i> today, when a stand-off</i>
 <i> occurred between squatters,</i>

999
00:59:19,957 --> 00:59:24,192
    <i> their supporters and the</i>
    <i> police over a building</i>
    <i> deemed unsafe.</i>

1000
00:59:24,194 --> 00:59:25,494
 If she loses the baby, okay...

1001
00:59:25,496 --> 00:59:29,197
    I mean, you hate to say
    this, but it's probably
         for the best.

1002
00:59:29,299 --> 00:59:32,134
     You know, she's not
     ready to be a mom.

1003
00:59:32,435 --> 00:59:35,203
     It's nature's way of
     taking care of things.

1004
00:59:35,738 --> 00:59:37,639
     How does it happen?

1005
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:40,809
      I mean, is it just
      like blood or...

1006
00:59:40,811 --> 00:59:42,144
         I do not know.

1007
00:59:42,146 --> 00:59:43,712
  I'll tell you this though.

1008
00:59:43,714 --> 00:59:47,316
  It's a relief to me that
  you're not the dad, okay?

1009
00:59:47,684 --> 00:59:48,984
     You don't want to get
     tied up in that.

1010
00:59:48,986 --> 00:59:51,587
 You know, the lady's
 grieving, she's distraught,

1011
00:59:51,589 --> 00:59:55,023
      she feels guilty,
      you feel guilty.

1012
00:59:55,025 --> 00:59:57,092
Babies.

1013
01:00:04,767 --> 01:00:08,036
 You know you were born here?

1014
01:00:09,038 --> 01:00:10,539
          It's true.

1015
01:00:10,873 --> 01:00:14,810
  The night we adopted you,
  your mom and I we were

1016
01:00:15,311 --> 01:00:16,278
      up in the nursery

1017
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:19,715
    in these rocking chairs,
    they gave us scrubs
    with these little

1018
01:00:19,717 --> 01:00:22,150
  shower caps for our heads
  and for our feet,

1019
01:00:22,152 --> 01:00:25,053
 like they thought we were
 going to give you the plague.

1020
01:00:26,522 --> 01:00:30,626
  We just waited and waited
  and waited

1021
01:00:30,628 --> 01:00:31,927
            for you.

1022
01:00:32,328 --> 01:00:34,696
 Seemed like we'd wait forever.

1023
01:00:35,765 --> 01:00:37,566
    Rocking back and forth,
    you know,

1024
01:00:37,568 --> 01:00:39,201
    your mom was so uptight.

1025
01:00:39,203 --> 01:00:43,205
 She was so worried your
 birth mother changed her mind.

1026
01:00:43,272 --> 01:00:46,508
     She had this king size
     bag of M&M's right,

1027
01:00:46,510 --> 01:00:49,645
and she just
     ate the whole thing

1028
01:00:49,647 --> 01:00:52,280
     while she was waiting
     for you.

1029
01:00:53,416 --> 01:00:57,019
     And then they, uh...
     They let us hold you.

1030
01:00:59,355 --> 01:01:02,424
 And you were so little,
 like a rabbit or something,

1031
01:01:02,426 --> 01:01:06,828
     you know, with this
     shock of black hair.

1032
01:01:06,830 --> 01:01:10,432
 And you looked at me
 and I was like, "Holy shit!

1033
01:01:11,034 --> 01:01:12,734
      "This kid is mine,

1034
01:01:12,736 --> 01:01:16,638
  "and the world's a fucking
  mess and I just wanna...

1035
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:20,509
 "I want to protect him
 from everything, you know."

1036
01:01:20,511 --> 01:01:23,745
  I mean, I have to protect
  him from everything.

1037
01:01:24,682 --> 01:01:29,051
    Oh, I walked out of here
    a different person.

1038
01:01:29,719 --> 01:01:32,521
         Yeah, well...
         So I thought.

1039
01:01:32,755 --> 01:01:34,856
     And then Prudence
     miraculously shows up.

1040
01:01:34,858 --> 01:01:37,292
 Right, first they tell you,
 it's impossible.

1041
01:01:37,294 --> 01:01:41,029
 Next thing, you're swimming
 in babies, two in one year.

1042
01:01:42,131 --> 01:01:43,065
        You know women,

1043
01:01:43,067 --> 01:01:48,570
 they make their decisions
 and men, we just do our best
 not to be men.

1044
01:01:50,006 --> 01:01:53,508
     The whole system needs
     a looking over.

1045
01:01:54,177 --> 01:01:55,343
Les.

1046
01:01:55,345 --> 01:01:56,878
         Oh, Jesus...

1047
01:01:58,014 --> 01:01:59,948
        Hey, sweetheart.

1048
01:02:06,623 --> 01:02:09,558
     "Bacterial vaginosis."

1049
01:02:10,093 --> 01:02:11,493
         Sounds exotic.

1050
01:02:11,495 --> 01:02:13,028
 It's just an infection, Les.

1051
01:02:13,030 --> 01:02:16,298
     Yeah, still, it sounds
     scary, you know?

1052
01:02:16,300 --> 01:02:19,201
  He saw her on the monitor,
  you know?

1053
01:02:20,236 --> 01:02:23,505
     She was jumping around
     like a jumping bean.

1054
01:02:24,140 --> 01:02:24,973
             She?

1055
01:02:24,975 --> 01:02:27,309
      -So they told you?
      -No.

1056
01:02:27,311 --> 01:02:29,878
     No, I mean, I didn't
     want to know.

1057
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:33,749
     For some reason I keep
     calling it Annabelle.

1058
01:02:34,851 --> 01:02:37,786
     Oh, well, your mom's
     gonna be psyched.

1059
01:02:37,954 --> 01:02:40,322
    You know, we're getting
    you home before 9:00.

1060
01:02:52,269 --> 01:02:54,469
     -No screaming, okay?
     -Yeah.

1061
01:02:54,471 --> 01:02:56,438
        All right. Okay.

1062
01:02:56,440 --> 01:02:59,841
  I can't believe you, of
  all people, ratted us out.

1063
01:02:59,843 --> 01:03:00,742
I didn't tell her!

1064
01:03:00,744 --> 01:03:04,346
    She got the one bill the
    hospital didn't send to
    my apartment.

1065
01:03:04,348 --> 01:03:06,248
    That's how far I've gone
    to cover for your asses.

1066
01:03:06,250 --> 01:03:07,449
Anything for
     a pound, right, Les?

1067
01:03:07,451 --> 01:03:09,451
 Leave the actual parenting
 to somebody who has the time.

1068
01:03:09,453 --> 01:03:11,353
  Okay, you can blame me for
  screwing up my own kids,

1069
01:03:11,355 --> 01:03:13,021
     -but this one you
     can't pin on me, okay?
     -Thank you.

1070
01:03:13,023 --> 01:03:14,589
  Well, I suppose I could've
  kept better tabs on her,

1071
01:03:14,591 --> 01:03:17,259
 if I just let her drop out and
 smoke reefer all day, hey?

1072
01:03:17,261 --> 01:03:18,527
 I don't smoke reefer anymore.

1073
01:03:18,529 --> 01:03:20,695
  Okay, listen, you two are
  peas in a pod, all right?

1074
01:03:20,697 --> 01:03:22,030
  You know why she doesn't
  tell you anything, Diane?

1075
01:03:22,032 --> 01:03:25,534
  Because you try to control
  every situation you get
  your hands on.

1076
01:03:25,536 --> 01:03:30,539
 And you know why she does
 that, 'cause you are totally
 out of control, all right?

1077
01:03:30,541 --> 01:03:34,209
 What, you been kicked out of
 19 schools already.

1078
01:03:34,211 --> 01:03:35,410
         Two, Les, two.

1079
01:03:35,412 --> 01:03:36,378
    You love to exaggerate,
    don't you?

1080
01:03:36,380 --> 01:03:40,482
 Yeah, well no wonder she wants
 you to go to this Florence
 Critteren facility.

1081
01:03:40,484 --> 01:03:41,316
             Shit!

1082
01:03:41,318 --> 01:03:43,318
         -Florence who?
         -Oh, God.

1083
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:44,853
     Why would I need to go
     to a facility?

1084
01:03:44,855 --> 01:03:46,188
     It's the only place
     that'll have you.

1085
01:03:46,190 --> 01:03:47,956
     It's a place where
     they take your baby.

1086
01:03:47,958 --> 01:03:49,758
 No, no, they don't take it.

1087
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:51,993
     -They don't sell it
     into slavery.
     -They don't.

1088
01:03:51,995 --> 01:03:57,532
  They give it to loving
  parents who can take care
  of it properly.

1089
01:03:57,534 --> 01:04:00,001
        You mean people
        like my dad?

1090
01:04:03,774 --> 01:04:05,807
         Oh, God! Okay.

1091
01:04:05,975 --> 01:04:07,642
    Okay, that's this, this,
    what's his name?

1092
01:04:07,644 --> 01:04:10,312
Johnny.
     -Johnny, thank you.

1093
01:04:10,314 --> 01:04:14,950
    Okay, so what I don't
    want right now, is a big
    scene, okay?

1094
01:04:14,952 --> 01:04:15,250
             Okay.

1095
01:04:15,252 --> 01:04:20,055
  This is an adult situation
  which we're all going
  to get through

1096
01:04:20,256 --> 01:04:22,724
 like civilized people, right?

1097
01:04:22,726 --> 01:04:26,528
  I've even had Nina make us
  all a nice leg of lamb.

1098
01:04:26,696 --> 01:04:27,963
         We're vegan.

1099
01:04:32,702 --> 01:04:36,404
    So I hear you three have
    been spending quite a
    bit of time together.

1100
01:04:36,406 --> 01:04:37,539
- Oops, sorry.

1101
01:04:37,541 --> 01:04:40,575
    It's like they speak
    in code, isn't it, Les.

1102
01:04:40,577 --> 01:04:43,712
 They say, um, "Straight Edge,"

1103
01:04:43,714 --> 01:04:44,613
          -vaygan...
          -Vegan.

1104
01:04:44,615 --> 01:04:47,482
     -Vegan's are from the
     the planet Vega.
     -Vegan, sorry.

1105
01:04:47,484 --> 01:04:48,950
         Vegan, yeah.

1106
01:04:49,552 --> 01:04:53,021
      We just go to the
      temple mostly.

1107
01:04:53,556 --> 01:04:56,791
        Yeah, I heard.
        The, the temple.

1108
01:04:56,959 --> 01:04:59,861
 Not like the temple where
 Eliza was bat mitzvah'ed, no.

1109
01:04:59,863 --> 01:05:04,399
 -Hmm.
 -It's the Hare Krishna temple
 in Brooklyn.

1110
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:06,635
     No, of course it is.

1111
01:05:08,871 --> 01:05:11,840
     So what do you do for
     a living Johnny?

1112
01:05:11,842 --> 01:05:13,174
        I'm a musician.

1113
01:05:13,176 --> 01:05:15,143
  I'm also a tattoo artist,

1114
01:05:15,145 --> 01:05:17,579
 but I don't... I don't tell
 too many people that,

1115
01:05:17,581 --> 01:05:19,714
     'cause it's illegal in
     the city right now.

1116
01:05:19,716 --> 01:05:21,182
- You don't have
     to worry about

1117
01:05:21,184 --> 01:05:24,419
  telling her anything,
  she's practically married
  to a drug dealer.

1118
01:05:24,421 --> 01:05:28,390
     -Uh-uh, a botanist.
     -No, we're not even
      remotely married.

1119
01:05:28,392 --> 01:05:30,158
     Specialty in cannabis.

1120
01:05:30,594 --> 01:05:35,063
    So do you manage to make
    a decent living applying
         your tattoos?

1121
01:05:35,065 --> 01:05:36,598
     Um, I'm getting there.

1122
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:38,099
        I work out of my
        squat right now,

1123
01:05:38,101 --> 01:05:40,535
     so there's not a whole
     lot of overhead.

1124
01:05:40,537 --> 01:05:44,806
    -That's smart.
    -In fact, there's none.

1125
01:05:46,742 --> 01:05:49,611
    What about your family,
    where do they live?

1126
01:05:50,012 --> 01:05:54,449
    You know, I don't really
    have much family, ma'am.

1127
01:05:54,817 --> 01:05:57,652
      -But I will soon.
      -Christ!

1128
01:05:58,387 --> 01:05:59,654
             Sorry.

1129
01:05:59,922 --> 01:06:01,189
     -Sorry.
     -No, I'm sorry, Mom.

1130
01:06:01,191 --> 01:06:04,192
      I'm sorry that my
      entire existence

1131
01:06:04,194 --> 01:06:05,126
- has disappointed you.
     -Okay...

1132
01:06:05,128 --> 01:06:08,897
  You know I bet that first
  kid you aborted would have
  been a real winner.

1133
01:06:08,899 --> 01:06:11,132
     -Eliza!
     -You obviously picked
     the wrong fetus.

1134
01:06:11,134 --> 01:06:13,068
For God's
        sake, Eliza!
        -Oh, my God!

1135
01:06:13,070 --> 01:06:15,704
    Here's the fact, ma'am.

1136
01:06:16,839 --> 01:06:19,207
    I want this baby just as
    much as Eliza does

1137
01:06:19,209 --> 01:06:23,912
  and nothing in this world
  is going to change that.

1138
01:06:23,914 --> 01:06:29,584
 So given that, I feel like
 now is as good a time as any.

1139
01:06:30,252 --> 01:06:32,921
     What, no, stop.
     Wait, okay, okay...

1140
01:06:32,923 --> 01:06:35,757
Sorry, hello? Dinner
 is officially over. Les!

1141
01:06:35,759 --> 01:06:37,993
 Yeah, okay, yeah.
 Hey, hey, Johnny, Johnny...

1142
01:06:37,995 --> 01:06:39,494
  It's a school night,
  so I think you should leave.

1143
01:06:39,496 --> 01:06:40,695
 -Les, could you help him go?
 -Yeah, come on, man.

1144
01:06:40,697 --> 01:06:42,364
I thought this
    is what we wanted.
    -Bad timing, bud.

1145
01:06:42,366 --> 01:06:46,468
 -Bad timing.
 -Good night, sweetheart. It
 was really nice to meet you.

1146
01:06:46,470 --> 01:06:48,603
      I'm sure I'll see
      you again soon.

1147
01:06:48,605 --> 01:06:51,106
 Um, thanks for coming, okay?

1148
01:06:51,108 --> 01:06:53,241
  You're not going anywhere.

1149
01:07:02,785 --> 01:07:04,552
Les!

1150
01:07:04,554 --> 01:07:08,156
 Shh, shh! Hey, come on now.

1151
01:07:08,891 --> 01:07:13,528
 Hey, it's 3:30 in the morning,
 all right? Jude's asleep.

1152
01:07:13,729 --> 01:07:15,497
     Good. I need to talk
     to you alone.

1153
01:07:15,499 --> 01:07:17,332
         Oh, my God!

1154
01:07:17,334 --> 01:07:18,466
     How did you escape?

1155
01:07:18,468 --> 01:07:22,971
  Waited for her Valium
  to kick in and slipped
  out the service stairwell.

1156
01:07:22,973 --> 01:07:24,906
      Oh, great, great.

1157
01:07:25,541 --> 01:07:28,443
 So, what, you're gonna,
 you're gonna move in with us?

1158
01:07:28,445 --> 01:07:31,079
      -Only temporarily.
      -Yeah?

1159
01:07:31,081 --> 01:07:36,084
    Johnny and I are getting
    married and I'm going
    on tour with the band.

1160
01:07:36,952 --> 01:07:38,186
 Okay, well, just so you know,

1161
01:07:38,188 --> 01:07:43,124
 that's about the worst
 fucking plan I've ever heard
 in my whole life, okay?

1162
01:07:43,126 --> 01:07:45,760
    I do know. Have you got
    a better one?

1163
01:07:45,762 --> 01:07:47,128
 I do. You have the baby here

1164
01:07:47,130 --> 01:07:48,329
 and then, you know, we sell
 it on the black market.

1165
01:07:48,331 --> 01:07:52,734
 I got a dude in Brooklyn who
 says he'll give us an easy
 10 grand for a white one.

1166
01:07:52,736 --> 01:07:53,868
 And what if it's not white?

1167
01:07:53,870 --> 01:07:58,840
 Well, that sounds like a
 conversation you should have
 with good old Johnny.

1168
01:08:00,843 --> 01:08:03,645
     Come on, you really
     want to marry this

1169
01:08:03,647 --> 01:08:06,214
 necklace-wearing Hare Rama?

1170
01:08:06,216 --> 01:08:08,383
      You love this guy?

1171
01:08:09,385 --> 01:08:12,053
  -I love how much he cares.
  -Right, and...

1172
01:08:12,055 --> 01:08:17,125
 And we can't get a real
 marriage license till I turn
 18 without parental consent

1173
01:08:17,127 --> 01:08:19,627
    and that's obviously not
    going to happen.

1174
01:08:19,629 --> 01:08:23,064
  It's more of a spiritual
  union thing at the temple.

1175
01:08:23,066 --> 01:08:25,066
     Okay. All right, well.

1176
01:08:25,201 --> 01:08:29,604
 Why don't you just try playing
 it all a little bit by ear,
 you know?

1177
01:08:29,606 --> 01:08:31,840
  Is that what you do, Les?

1178
01:08:31,842 --> 01:08:33,241
     You just play it all
     by ear?

1179
01:08:33,243 --> 01:08:36,578
  Yeah, I find it's the best
  organ to play by.

1180
01:08:36,580 --> 01:08:41,449
 Yeah, I mean, I have been
 accused of playing by another,
 but, uh...

1181
01:08:42,017 --> 01:08:43,318
            Come on.

1182
01:08:43,320 --> 01:08:43,952
            No, hey.

1183
01:08:43,954 --> 01:08:47,455
 Come on, you're just so young,
 sweetheart. You are.

1184
01:08:47,457 --> 01:08:50,892
     I just need some place
     safe to go, Les.

1185
01:08:51,794 --> 01:08:54,996
Some place
     I can actually think,

1186
01:08:54,998 --> 01:08:56,998
         away from her.

1187
01:08:58,067 --> 01:09:00,268
 You know, if I help you out,

1188
01:09:00,270 --> 01:09:06,207
 it'll pretty much destroy
 what's left of my relationship
 with your mother, right?

1189
01:09:08,878 --> 01:09:10,278
            Well...

1190
01:09:11,113 --> 01:09:12,547
             Oh.

1191
01:09:12,549 --> 01:09:15,984
    Did you meet my old lady
    when you were out there
    in Vermont?

1192
01:09:15,986 --> 01:09:18,453
     No. We were too busy
     with sex and drugs.

1193
01:09:18,455 --> 01:09:22,590
 Well, she's a piece of work,
 you know, but...

1194
01:09:23,426 --> 01:09:27,262
 ...she's better at this kind
 of shit than I am.

1195
01:09:28,797 --> 01:09:32,500
    You know, I believe in
    this and I have to do it

1196
01:09:32,502 --> 01:09:33,234
          for Teddy.

1197
01:09:33,236 --> 01:09:35,503
     Neither of us had
     a father in our life.

1198
01:09:36,206 --> 01:09:39,707
 It would mean a lot to me if
 you'd say, you'd understand.

1199
01:09:39,709 --> 01:09:41,743
        I can't say that
        because I don't.

1200
01:09:41,745 --> 01:09:43,578
  There's a strong tradition
  in lots of cultures

1201
01:09:43,580 --> 01:09:46,848
     that when a man dies,
     his brother steps in
     to marry his wife.

1202
01:09:46,850 --> 01:09:50,818
     It's even in Krishna
     consciousness, re-read
     the <i> Laws of Manu.</i>

1203
01:09:50,820 --> 01:09:53,655
     They call it
     "widow inheritance."

1204
01:09:53,657 --> 01:09:56,157
 Now that's fucking romantic.

1205
01:09:58,027 --> 01:10:02,497
 So you're just going to carry
 your brother's ashes around
 with you, forever?

1206
01:10:04,099 --> 01:10:06,100
      Rooster, come on.

1207
01:10:06,468 --> 01:10:09,170
      Not even the dead
      get to be free.

1208
01:11:06,462 --> 01:11:07,829
             Les!

1209
01:11:09,498 --> 01:11:12,467
    Open the door, you fuck.
    I know you're in there.

1210
01:11:13,402 --> 01:11:16,504
     -Just trying to get
     my daughter.
     -Oh, all right.

1211
01:11:18,807 --> 01:11:20,308
             Les!

1212
01:11:23,379 --> 01:11:24,646
             Hey!

1213
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:27,181
     Take good care of her,
     Saint Jude.

1214
01:11:27,183 --> 01:11:28,916
 It's a bit late for that, Dad.

1215
01:11:28,918 --> 01:11:29,984
  The van's a piece of shit.

1216
01:11:29,986 --> 01:11:32,487
      I'm talking about
      Eliza, champ.

1217
01:11:33,188 --> 01:11:35,723
- You should talk to
     Johnny about that.

1218
01:11:35,725 --> 01:11:37,358
     -He's her husband now.
     -Mmm.

1219
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:38,259
        At least in the
        eyes of Krishna.

1220
01:11:38,261 --> 01:11:41,362
     You don't sound too
     happy about that.

1221
01:11:43,499 --> 01:11:45,233
  -What are you going to do?
  -Hmm.

1222
01:11:45,235 --> 01:11:47,735
     Try to get Princess Di
     off your trail,

1223
01:11:47,737 --> 01:11:49,671
  if she'll even talk to me.

1224
01:11:52,708 --> 01:11:55,443
     You know, I really
     appreciate all this.

1225
01:11:55,744 --> 01:11:58,680
    What else am I gonna do?
    After being such a
    useless shit for...

1226
01:11:58,682 --> 01:12:00,448
     Let's get this show
     on the road!

1227
01:12:00,450 --> 01:12:03,251
 Yeah, all right, all right!

1228
01:12:37,420 --> 01:12:39,654
- Take it easy, Jude.
- Sorry.

1229
01:12:39,656 --> 01:12:42,423
  God, he's only had his
  license for, like, a week.

1230
01:12:42,425 --> 01:12:45,460
      Oh, I hope we make
      it there alive.

1231
01:12:45,462 --> 01:12:48,262
      Is, uh, is Rooster
      not coming at all?

1232
01:12:48,264 --> 01:12:49,630
             Oh...

1233
01:12:50,032 --> 01:12:51,899
      Rooster is, uh...

1234
01:12:52,568 --> 01:12:55,303
    He's gonna play with
    another band for a bit.

1235
01:12:55,904 --> 01:12:57,538
     Why's he doing that?

1236
01:12:57,873 --> 01:13:00,274
  Well, the lead singer, uh,

1237
01:13:00,276 --> 01:13:01,976
        had a really bad
        heroin problem

1238
01:13:01,978 --> 01:13:03,745
 and needed a good influence.

1239
01:13:03,747 --> 01:13:06,681
    So who's gonna play
    guitar for Army of One?

1240
01:13:08,317 --> 01:13:09,550
            Well...

1241
01:13:09,752 --> 01:13:12,787
 There is an open slot, my man.

1242
01:13:14,556 --> 01:13:16,324
<i> This time</i>
     <i> you've really crossed</i>

1243
01:13:16,326 --> 01:13:19,060
     -the line.
     -Okay, tell me, what
     was I supposed to do?

1244
01:13:19,062 --> 01:13:22,697
     Certainly not lend
     them your van, Les!

1245
01:13:23,732 --> 01:13:26,067
    They were gonna run away
    to God knows where.

1246
01:13:26,069 --> 01:13:28,736
     I convinced them to
     take her to Harriet's

1247
01:13:28,738 --> 01:13:31,606
    -where she will be safe.
    -Well, now you can
    take me there then.

1248
01:13:31,608 --> 01:13:32,173
        -No, I can't...
        -Okay?

1249
01:13:32,175 --> 01:13:35,009
 No, she says if you show up
 there, she's gonna go on
 tour with the band.

1250
01:13:35,011 --> 01:13:38,012
--Hopping from
      motel to motel...

1251
01:13:38,014 --> 01:13:42,417
    Come on, that's no life
    for a pregnant teenager.

1252
01:13:45,087 --> 01:13:48,222
Why is she
     doing this to me?

1253
01:13:52,394 --> 01:13:54,429
     Look, I, I have their
     confidence, okay?

1254
01:13:54,431 --> 01:13:57,832
 There's a, there's a open line
 of communication, right?

1255
01:13:57,834 --> 01:14:01,936
     Now, Harriet will tell
     me everything.

1256
01:14:02,104 --> 01:14:04,572
    Eliza is in good hands.
    Come on, babe.

1257
01:14:04,574 --> 01:14:06,207
      I know it doesn't
      seem like it,

1258
01:14:06,209 --> 01:14:09,143
     but I've been doing
     all this for you.

1259
01:14:14,716 --> 01:14:17,718
      You really need
      to leave now, Les.

1260
01:14:35,637 --> 01:14:37,338
          -Jude.
          -Hey, Mom.

1261
01:14:37,340 --> 01:14:39,173
Hi.

1262
01:14:39,508 --> 01:14:41,342
      Look at your hair.

1263
01:14:41,410 --> 01:14:43,811
      -Is it really you?
      -It really is.

1264
01:14:44,646 --> 01:14:47,014
    -Something smells good.
    -Mmm, come in.

1265
01:14:47,016 --> 01:14:48,749
     And you must be Eliza.

1266
01:14:48,751 --> 01:14:50,117
- Hi.
- Hey, Prudence.

1267
01:14:50,119 --> 01:14:52,220
     Tell me, sweetie,
     you're how far along?

1268
01:14:52,222 --> 01:14:53,988
    -I'm almost six months.
    -Wonderful!

1269
01:14:53,990 --> 01:14:56,224
 Then you're way past all that
 morning sickness nonsense.

1270
01:14:56,226 --> 01:15:01,128
- Mom says you started smoking.
-  I hope it's only cigarettes.

1271
01:15:01,130 --> 01:15:02,463
 Come in, it's nice to see you.

1272
01:15:02,465 --> 01:15:03,498
     Come in, I have a
     vegetarian dinner...

1273
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:06,334
Oh, my God.
     -...or breakfast,
     or whatever, on.

1274
01:15:06,336 --> 01:15:09,303
     -Hey, hi.
     -Well, come on, come
     in. Hello, Johnny.

1275
01:15:11,473 --> 01:15:13,641
Harriet's so great.

1276
01:15:14,276 --> 01:15:16,177
     So easy to talk to.

1277
01:15:17,279 --> 01:15:18,513
             Yeah.

1278
01:15:19,181 --> 01:15:23,217
     She was... She was so
     good to Teddy too.

1279
01:15:23,886 --> 01:15:24,385
          You know?

1280
01:15:24,387 --> 01:15:28,189
 She was like... She was like
 the mom he never had.

1281
01:15:56,585 --> 01:15:57,919
  So I guess this is, uh...

1282
01:15:57,921 --> 01:16:00,655
     It's kind of like
     our honeymoon, huh?

1283
01:16:01,523 --> 01:16:02,757
             Yeah.

1284
01:16:03,625 --> 01:16:04,859
            Well...

1285
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:08,195
     It ain't exactly
     Hawaii, but it'll do.

1286
01:17:33,315 --> 01:17:35,349
Yeah, but it tastes
 so much better without the...

1287
01:17:35,351 --> 01:17:38,753
No, I asked for
 a salad and you would come
 back with one-inch carrots!

1288
01:17:38,755 --> 01:17:40,755
- I remember that,
      I remember that.

1289
01:17:40,757 --> 01:17:44,191
"Okay, need a few
 more." Very sweet.

1290
01:17:44,193 --> 01:17:48,396
No, no. We
    were just gonna have one
    carrot, that was dinner.

1291
01:17:48,697 --> 01:17:49,897
 How much of this do you want?

1292
01:17:49,899 --> 01:17:52,733
    Um, well, I see four
    there, so probably four.

1293
01:17:52,735 --> 01:17:53,668
I'm hungry.

1294
01:17:53,670 --> 01:17:55,936
         Excuse me one
         second, guys.

1295
01:17:55,938 --> 01:17:57,471
          Sure, hon.

1296
01:18:21,930 --> 01:18:23,164
             Hello?

1297
01:18:24,966 --> 01:18:26,200
             Hello?

1298
01:18:30,172 --> 01:18:31,405
             Eliza?

1299
01:18:32,808 --> 01:18:34,075
             <i> Eliza?</i>

1300
01:18:41,750 --> 01:18:44,952
     Yeah, but... But...
     Why, why...

1301
01:18:45,253 --> 01:18:47,755
      Why would you move
      to California?

1302
01:18:52,861 --> 01:18:54,595
That isn't fair.

1303
01:18:54,597 --> 01:18:57,865
 It's not like we ever
 had anything that was defined,

1304
01:18:57,867 --> 01:18:59,233
          you know?

1305
01:19:01,103 --> 01:19:03,604
     That's how you wanted
     it, Rooster.

1306
01:19:10,645 --> 01:19:14,215
 Maybe we both use the scene
 as a cover, huh?

1307
01:19:18,820 --> 01:19:20,221
            I know.

1308
01:19:21,957 --> 01:19:25,126
    Please don't do anything
    until I see you.

1309
01:19:25,460 --> 01:19:29,130
 I just lost my brother,
 I don't need to lose you too.

1310
01:19:33,568 --> 01:19:37,438
And the first leg
    of our world tour
    comes to an end.

1311
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:38,372
             Whoo!

1312
01:19:58,326 --> 01:20:01,362
      What're you doing
      up at this hour?

1313
01:20:02,430 --> 01:20:05,032
      I could ask you
      the same question.

1314
01:20:06,202 --> 01:20:09,270
     Annabelle won't let
     me sleep anymore.

1315
01:20:11,373 --> 01:20:12,606
            Plus...

1316
01:20:13,141 --> 01:20:15,409
      Johnny boy snores.

1317
01:20:19,748 --> 01:20:21,782
     What're you writing?

1318
01:20:22,751 --> 01:20:25,152
    -It's just some lyrics.
    -Hmm.

1319
01:20:25,154 --> 01:20:26,353
         For a song.

1320
01:20:26,355 --> 01:20:28,122
     Is it about a girl?

1321
01:20:28,857 --> 01:20:30,291
No.

1322
01:20:30,293 --> 01:20:31,759
    No, it's not like that.

1323
01:20:31,761 --> 01:20:33,027
         Oh, come on.

1324
01:20:33,029 --> 01:20:35,062
  With that beautiful face,

1325
01:20:35,064 --> 01:20:38,732
  I'm sure you have to beat
  the groupies away by now.

1326
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:42,236
    You know that's not
    what our scene's about.

1327
01:20:42,238 --> 01:20:43,571
            Jude...

1328
01:20:43,573 --> 01:20:46,273
     Are you really gonna
     let those stupid,

1329
01:20:46,275 --> 01:20:50,411
 Straight Edge rules keep you
 from finding true love?

1330
01:20:58,820 --> 01:21:01,655
      You know, today is
      Teddy's birthday.

1331
01:21:07,329 --> 01:21:09,463
     He would have been 18.

1332
01:21:22,577 --> 01:21:24,879
     Happy birthday, Teddy.

1333
01:21:50,538 --> 01:21:51,238
 I don't, I don't understand.

1334
01:21:51,240 --> 01:21:53,707
     You said that whenever
     you weren't playing,
     you would be with me.

1335
01:21:53,709 --> 01:21:57,044
     I know. I got to make
     sure my squat's okay.

1336
01:21:57,046 --> 01:22:00,981
    You know, the city,
    they're evicting people
    left and right,

1337
01:22:00,983 --> 01:22:05,286
 now that the yuppies
 want to live there.
 It's crazy.

1338
01:22:08,290 --> 01:22:09,957
Don't be mad, okay?

1339
01:22:09,959 --> 01:22:12,893
     I'm working on a new
     plan for both of us.

1340
01:22:40,956 --> 01:22:42,489
      Jude, have you...

1341
01:22:42,491 --> 01:22:44,825
 Have you ever thought about...

1342
01:22:46,127 --> 01:22:48,829
     Searching for
     your birth parents?

1343
01:22:52,901 --> 01:22:53,901
         Not really.

1344
01:22:53,903 --> 01:22:57,037
     I, uh, I was talking
     to Eric in your band.

1345
01:22:57,505 --> 01:23:00,140
     He told me he met his
     birth mother in Korea.

1346
01:23:00,475 --> 01:23:02,776
     He said it was
     a great experience.

1347
01:23:03,211 --> 01:23:04,278
        Eric's adopted?

1348
01:23:04,280 --> 01:23:07,514
  His last name's Steinberg,
  what do you think?

1349
01:23:08,316 --> 01:23:10,884
    I don't know, I mean,
    he never talks about it.

1350
01:23:10,886 --> 01:23:12,186
      That's because
      he's okay with it.

1351
01:23:12,188 --> 01:23:16,991
 He's got such an
 interesting perspective
 on how life works, that guy.

1352
01:23:16,993 --> 01:23:20,861
  Why're you talking to Eric
  about stuff like this?

1353
01:23:22,797 --> 01:23:25,666
     I think Johnny's got
     someone else.

1354
01:23:30,939 --> 01:23:33,207
        Why aren't you
        saying anything?

1355
01:23:34,642 --> 01:23:36,810
  I don't know what to say.

1356
01:23:37,178 --> 01:23:38,545
         Maybe you do.

1357
01:23:39,681 --> 01:23:42,683
     Maybe you do, Jude,
     and you just won't.

1358
01:23:57,198 --> 01:23:58,665
            Eliza...

1359
01:24:00,435 --> 01:24:01,835
         Just say it.

1360
01:24:02,537 --> 01:24:05,973
Johnny and I
     are a sham.

1361
01:24:06,341 --> 01:24:09,643
Oh, God.
 This whole thing's a big joke.

1362
01:24:10,478 --> 01:24:13,113
 You're gonna have Teddy's baby
 and it will be beautiful.

1363
01:24:13,115 --> 01:24:17,351
     I don't even remember
     what Teddy looks like.

1364
01:24:18,920 --> 01:24:20,421
             Fuck!

1365
01:24:20,423 --> 01:24:20,921
             I try.

1366
01:24:20,923 --> 01:24:24,358
     I try really hard when
     I'm falling asleep at
     night, but I just...

1367
01:24:24,360 --> 01:24:27,061
 I can't seem to put his face
 together in my mind.

1368
01:24:27,063 --> 01:24:29,029
  You should have said.
  I, I have pictures of him.

1369
01:24:29,031 --> 01:24:32,166
     It's not... It's not
     about pictures, Jude.

1370
01:24:32,168 --> 01:24:33,967
      You and Johnny are
      exactly the same.

1371
01:24:33,969 --> 01:24:37,738
  You both want some little
  replacement for Teddy.

1372
01:24:37,939 --> 01:24:39,907
     That's why I call her
     Annabelle.

1373
01:24:39,909 --> 01:24:41,742
      So that everyone
      will just stop it

1374
01:24:41,744 --> 01:24:44,845
      and think about me
      once in a while.

1375
01:24:49,084 --> 01:24:50,951
- Listen...

1376
01:24:50,953 --> 01:24:53,921
 I will always be here for you.

1377
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:00,327
             -Hey.
             -Hmm?

1378
01:25:16,377 --> 01:25:17,611
            Eliza...

1379
01:25:18,213 --> 01:25:19,513
         Jude, Jude...

1380
01:25:19,515 --> 01:25:22,816
  -Stop.
  -No, I wanna be with you.

1381
01:25:24,419 --> 01:25:26,153
         Jude, Jude...

1382
01:25:26,421 --> 01:25:28,489
  Do you really want to lose
  your virginity

1383
01:25:28,491 --> 01:25:31,758
 to some messed up, pregnant
 girl in a green house?

1384
01:25:32,260 --> 01:25:33,527
             Yeah.

1385
01:25:35,463 --> 01:25:39,233
  Wait, what makes you think
  I'm a virgin?

1386
01:25:40,435 --> 01:25:43,070
 Teddy told me you both were.

1387
01:25:46,508 --> 01:25:48,275
         Thanks, Teddy.

1388
01:25:51,846 --> 01:25:53,814
            Oh, God.

1389
01:25:56,584 --> 01:25:58,819
Sorry.

1390
01:25:58,920 --> 01:26:00,420
Oh, Jude...

1391
01:26:05,193 --> 01:26:07,261
So, how long
     will you be gone?

1392
01:26:07,263 --> 01:26:09,496
    I don't know. I just
    need to confront Johnny

1393
01:26:09,498 --> 01:26:10,531
     and then I'll decide.

1394
01:26:10,533 --> 01:26:12,065
     I can't just sit
     around here anymore.

1395
01:26:12,067 --> 01:26:15,369
 -But you'll come back before?
 -Yes, I will.

1396
01:26:15,371 --> 01:26:16,303
 Whether he wants it or not,

1397
01:26:16,305 --> 01:26:19,373
 I want you, of all people,
 to be there when it happens.

1398
01:26:21,910 --> 01:26:24,011
     That means the world
     to me, hon.

1399
01:26:26,080 --> 01:26:27,614
          Thank you.

1400
01:26:29,751 --> 01:26:30,417
     You'll come back soon?

1401
01:26:30,419 --> 01:26:33,086
    So I can tell you how
    very proud of you I am.

1402
01:26:33,821 --> 01:26:35,422
         I will, Mom.

1403
01:26:59,781 --> 01:27:01,014
             Hello?

1404
01:27:01,016 --> 01:27:01,815
            Harriet?

1405
01:27:01,817 --> 01:27:03,984
          -Mmm-hmm.
          -Diane.

1406
01:27:05,186 --> 01:27:06,553
         Diane Caplan.

1407
01:27:07,755 --> 01:27:10,324
          Oh, shit!

1408
01:27:11,459 --> 01:27:15,229
 So, I'm sure you've heard
 that I was against all this.

1409
01:27:15,231 --> 01:27:16,296
          But I'm...

1410
01:27:16,298 --> 01:27:18,365
     I've had some time
     to think about it now

1411
01:27:18,367 --> 01:27:20,000
 and I'm prepared to accept it,

1412
01:27:20,002 --> 01:27:24,404
    and to help her in
    whatever way she needs.

1413
01:27:25,340 --> 01:27:27,441
      That's what I came
      to tell her.

1414
01:27:27,443 --> 01:27:28,442
     Well, I feel awful.

1415
01:27:28,444 --> 01:27:31,712
  It didn't occur to me that
  you would actually come

1416
01:27:31,714 --> 01:27:32,145
         when I called.

1417
01:27:32,147 --> 01:27:34,314
  I just wanted you to know
  how much she missed you.

1418
01:27:34,316 --> 01:27:37,017
    No, you were just trying
    to help. I...

1419
01:27:37,019 --> 01:27:39,586
 I'm famous for my bad timing.

1420
01:27:39,588 --> 01:27:41,021
     I actually would have
     been here sooner

1421
01:27:41,023 --> 01:27:42,289
     but I was terrified of
     driving myself and...

1422
01:27:42,291 --> 01:27:44,458
 God, that must sound so silly
 to a woman like you, but...

1423
01:27:44,460 --> 01:27:46,093
      I didn't want Les
      to bring me here

1424
01:27:46,095 --> 01:27:48,528
     because I thought
     that might be, um...

1425
01:27:48,530 --> 01:27:50,530
     You know... Awkward.

1426
01:27:50,532 --> 01:27:53,000
That could be awkward.

1427
01:27:53,002 --> 01:27:54,901
         Little bit.

1428
01:27:55,069 --> 01:27:55,902
      Well, I'm curious,

1429
01:27:55,904 --> 01:27:58,639
     you just said,
     "A woman like you."

1430
01:27:59,274 --> 01:28:01,174
 Uh, what did you mean by that?

1431
01:28:01,176 --> 01:28:02,676
     No! I didn't mean...

1432
01:28:02,678 --> 01:28:05,612
     God, no. I, I just
     meant that you, you...

1433
01:28:05,614 --> 01:28:07,547
     Strike me as
     somebody who's, um...

1434
01:28:07,549 --> 01:28:09,283
     You know, who's hardy.

1435
01:28:09,285 --> 01:28:14,187
 Ha, that sounds like a
 polite way of saying bumpkin.

1436
01:28:14,189 --> 01:28:14,488
             Gosh!

1437
01:28:14,490 --> 01:28:16,757
     -I've insulted you
     already, haven't I?
     -No, no. It's fine.

1438
01:28:16,759 --> 01:28:19,826
    I am a bit of a bumpkin,
    and I'm hardy too.
    It's okay, it's okay.

1439
01:28:19,828 --> 01:28:24,331
     But you know what,
     believe it or not,
     I don't drive either.

1440
01:28:24,333 --> 01:28:26,333
          -Really?
          -Mmm-mmm.

1441
01:28:26,501 --> 01:28:28,335
     God, how do you
     manage that out here?

1442
01:28:28,337 --> 01:28:30,937
     You're in the middle
     of nowhere.

1443
01:28:30,939 --> 01:28:32,172
             Wow!

1444
01:28:43,418 --> 01:28:45,018
        What's so funny?

1445
01:28:49,123 --> 01:28:52,893
     Do you think that when
     we get older and...

1446
01:28:53,127 --> 01:28:55,996
     We've, like, drifted
     apart 'cause...

1447
01:28:56,564 --> 01:28:59,900
    Let's face it, the odds
    are that we will, right?

1448
01:29:00,735 --> 01:29:05,272
    Will you remember me as
    the most fucked up girl
        you ever knew?

1449
01:29:08,943 --> 01:29:10,177
             Hmm.

1450
01:29:10,179 --> 01:29:11,812
            I would.

1451
01:29:22,256 --> 01:29:23,090
<i> And in the East Village</i>

1452
01:29:23,092 --> 01:29:25,692
 <i> the police set up a perimeter</i>
 <i> around Tompkins Square Park</i>

1453
01:29:25,694 --> 01:29:29,529
  <i> in anticipation of a clash</i>
  <i> over the community board's</i>
            <i> new rule.</i>

1454
01:29:29,531 --> 01:29:31,865
      <i> Angry locals blame</i>
      <i> gentrification...</i>

1455
01:29:31,867 --> 01:29:33,667
Just leave us off here.

1456
01:29:42,977 --> 01:29:44,344
          Excuse me?

1457
01:29:45,713 --> 01:29:46,279
      What is all this?

1458
01:29:46,281 --> 01:29:49,282
 Fucking mayor wants a curfew
 in the park to get rid
 of the homeless.

1459
01:29:49,284 --> 01:29:51,651
     But we know he wants
     to get rid of us too.

1460
01:29:51,653 --> 01:29:54,421
      Come on, let's get
      out of here.

1461
01:29:54,655 --> 01:29:57,858
I really don't
  know how to thank you for
  everything you've done.

1462
01:29:57,860 --> 01:29:59,726
  I feel like I should offer
  you money or something.

1463
01:29:59,728 --> 01:30:02,429
 Don't be silly, I've enjoyed
 having Eliza here.

1464
01:30:02,431 --> 01:30:04,364
 I think it was good for me.

1465
01:30:04,366 --> 01:30:05,932
         In what way?

1466
01:30:06,667 --> 01:30:08,869
  I don't know, really. I...

1467
01:30:09,837 --> 01:30:14,841
  I suspect it had something
  to do with the idea of
  Jude's birth mother.

1468
01:30:14,843 --> 01:30:17,811
     She was apparently
     the exact same age.

1469
01:30:17,813 --> 01:30:20,013
          -Was she?
          -Mmm-hmm.

1470
01:30:20,348 --> 01:30:22,382
     What happened to her?

1471
01:30:23,785 --> 01:30:25,419
         I don't know.

1472
01:30:31,292 --> 01:30:34,027
     I do think that even
     with all this mess

1473
01:30:34,029 --> 01:30:35,328
     we've somehow managed
     to raise spirited,

1474
01:30:35,330 --> 01:30:37,597
 -smart kids, you know?
 -Right, in spite of ourselves.

1475
01:30:37,599 --> 01:30:39,566
- Yes, and especially

1476
01:30:39,568 --> 01:30:42,068
        -despite Lester.
        -Yeah.

1477
01:30:46,908 --> 01:30:50,644
      Hey, Mr. Clean.
      Come on in, there.

1478
01:30:51,345 --> 01:30:53,313
             -Yeah.
             -Hi.

1479
01:30:53,414 --> 01:30:56,683
Okay, I, uh, I
 organized this little soiree.

1480
01:30:56,685 --> 01:30:57,651
      Have a seat, uh...

1481
01:30:57,653 --> 01:31:00,153
     These two showed up
     at my doorstep.

1482
01:31:00,155 --> 01:31:02,756
  And it seemed like
  there was some serious air

1483
01:31:02,758 --> 01:31:05,859
 -that needed to be cleared.
 -Yeah, I know.

1484
01:31:06,627 --> 01:31:08,361
     You haven't called us
     for two weeks.

1485
01:31:08,363 --> 01:31:10,163
      You really think
      that's acceptable?

1486
01:31:10,165 --> 01:31:11,998
 Only because I needed to wait.

1487
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,801
    For what, Johnny?
    For the baby to be born?

1488
01:31:14,803 --> 01:31:17,170
     No. To be 100% sure,

1489
01:31:17,172 --> 01:31:19,206
         but now I am.

1490
01:31:19,208 --> 01:31:22,008
      So I'm really glad
      you're both here.

1491
01:31:22,010 --> 01:31:23,610
        Sure about what?

1492
01:31:35,857 --> 01:31:37,624
         What is this?

1493
01:31:37,892 --> 01:31:41,061
     That's Ravi Milan
     and his wife, Arpeeta.

1494
01:31:41,063 --> 01:31:42,462
        Ravi's a lawyer.

1495
01:31:42,464 --> 01:31:44,264
    Why do we need a lawyer?

1496
01:31:44,966 --> 01:31:47,534
    Ravi's also Teddy's dad.

1497
01:31:48,469 --> 01:31:51,471
 I knew, I knew from my mom
 he was in New York somewhere

1498
01:31:51,473 --> 01:31:52,472
     but I, I never
     attempted to find him.

1499
01:31:52,474 --> 01:31:56,209
     I, I always figured
     that Teddy would do
     that someday, but...

1500
01:31:56,211 --> 01:31:58,111
      You know, lately,
      it occurred to me

1501
01:31:58,113 --> 01:32:01,381
     that Teddy's dad might
     be able to help us out
          with money.

1502
01:32:01,383 --> 01:32:03,550
    You know, for the baby.

1503
01:32:03,552 --> 01:32:05,952
     And, and after having
     finally met him,

1504
01:32:05,954 --> 01:32:09,723
  I think he can help us out
  with so much more.

1505
01:32:09,725 --> 01:32:11,157
          Like what?

1506
01:32:12,560 --> 01:32:13,894
            Well...

1507
01:32:13,896 --> 01:32:15,662
      Like with a home.

1508
01:32:16,197 --> 01:32:18,031
     What're you saying?

1509
01:32:18,266 --> 01:32:20,467
     The Milans, they have
     no children.

1510
01:32:20,469 --> 01:32:21,868
When I spoke to Ravi

1511
01:32:21,870 --> 01:32:23,937
     he was crushed by what
     happened to Teddy.

1512
01:32:23,939 --> 01:32:26,306
  He felt like he completely
  missed out on the chance

1513
01:32:26,308 --> 01:32:29,276
 to ever get to know him
 because of my mom's insanity.

1514
01:32:29,278 --> 01:32:29,843
     What're you saying?

1515
01:32:29,845 --> 01:32:35,248
  Adoption is something the
  Milans have discussed
  for some time now.

1516
01:32:35,250 --> 01:32:37,417
Oh, my God.

1517
01:32:37,685 --> 01:32:40,420
  This is what you've wanted
  the whole time, isn't it?

1518
01:32:40,422 --> 01:32:41,354
          -No, no.
          -Isn't it?

1519
01:32:41,356 --> 01:32:43,957
    Well, why didn't you
    just fuckin' say so from
    the beginning?

1520
01:32:43,959 --> 01:32:46,626
    -Why did you have to
    put me through all this?
    -Whoa, whoa...

1521
01:32:46,628 --> 01:32:47,994
 Eliza, Eliza, what I wanted

1522
01:32:47,996 --> 01:32:51,631
     was for Teddy's child
     to be with family.

1523
01:32:51,633 --> 01:32:53,233
         Teddy's child?

1524
01:32:53,834 --> 01:32:54,267
         Teddy's child.

1525
01:32:54,269 --> 01:32:56,436
 -At the time I thought that
 that could only mean me.
 -It's Teddy's child?

1526
01:32:56,438 --> 01:32:58,872
I can't believe this.
 I can't fuckin' believe this.

1527
01:32:58,874 --> 01:33:02,075
  But Ravi has so much more
  to offer a child than us.

1528
01:33:02,077 --> 01:33:06,279
It's everything
 we wanna give Annabelle.

1529
01:33:06,281 --> 01:33:08,048
         But better.

1530
01:33:09,083 --> 01:33:11,384
     I can't believe this.

1531
01:33:11,819 --> 01:33:12,519
             Oh!

1532
01:33:12,521 --> 01:33:14,521
--Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa,
    whoa, whoa! Hey, Jude...

1533
01:33:14,523 --> 01:33:18,158
     You're a fraud! He
     just wants to be with
     his fuckin' boyfriend.

1534
01:33:18,160 --> 01:33:19,392
 He wants to run to California,

1535
01:33:19,394 --> 01:33:21,428
     just toss Eliza and
     the baby aside.

1536
01:33:21,430 --> 01:33:23,363
     -That's not how it is.
     -Tell the truth!

1537
01:33:23,365 --> 01:33:24,564
        Jude, hey, hey.

1538
01:33:24,566 --> 01:33:26,433
         Fuckin' liar!

1539
01:33:26,435 --> 01:33:27,100
             Eliza!

1540
01:33:27,102 --> 01:33:29,936
Excuse me, excuse me.

1541
01:33:44,251 --> 01:33:46,987
     I don't really know
     what's going on.

1542
01:33:46,989 --> 01:33:48,888
         Jude is right.

1543
01:33:49,523 --> 01:33:51,324
  I've fucked everything up.

1544
01:33:51,659 --> 01:33:55,195
 All I wanted was to finally
 do right by Teddy.

1545
01:33:55,529 --> 01:33:57,964
We say fuck you!
      We say fuck you!

1546
01:33:57,966 --> 01:33:59,332
Eliza!

1547
01:34:01,736 --> 01:34:04,070
        We say fuck you!
        We say fuck you!

1548
01:34:06,607 --> 01:34:07,974
             Eliza!

1549
01:34:14,615 --> 01:34:15,882
             Eliza!

1550
01:34:19,153 --> 01:34:21,521
I have the
      right to be here!

1551
01:34:31,866 --> 01:34:33,099
             Eliza!

1552
01:34:34,468 --> 01:34:35,802
             Eliza!

1553
01:34:42,910 --> 01:34:44,411
Get back here!

1554
01:34:57,658 --> 01:34:58,925
          Hey, hey!

1555
01:34:58,927 --> 01:35:00,293
             <i> Eliza!</i>

1556
01:35:02,029 --> 01:35:03,263
            Asshole!

1557
01:35:07,268 --> 01:35:09,202
  Hey, Eliza! Are you okay?

1558
01:35:09,204 --> 01:35:10,970
     All right, watch out,
     all right?
     She's pregnant!

1559
01:35:10,972 --> 01:35:15,208
 -Nobody gets to lay a claim
 on this baby but me, Jude.
          -I know.

1560
01:35:15,210 --> 01:35:16,576
Nobody!

1561
01:35:17,812 --> 01:35:19,312
  I wanted to have a family.

1562
01:35:19,314 --> 01:35:22,148
 Just a family, a good family
 who wants a baby,

1563
01:35:22,150 --> 01:35:23,516
     not people trying to
     bring Teddy back,

1564
01:35:23,518 --> 01:35:25,852
  not some long-lost father
  who's trying to make up

1565
01:35:25,854 --> 01:35:27,687
 -for his shitty past, okay?
 -I know.

1566
01:35:27,689 --> 01:35:29,689
     I just want a family,
     that's all I want!

1567
01:35:29,691 --> 01:35:32,525
     Whatever you want,
     that's what we'll do.

1568
01:35:32,527 --> 01:35:32,992
             Okay?

1569
01:35:32,994 --> 01:35:35,895
     Now let's just get
     the fuck out of here.

1570
01:36:02,356 --> 01:36:03,523
      Is the baby okay?

1571
01:36:03,525 --> 01:36:07,360
Oh, hey, hey, hey,
    the patient speaks.

1572
01:36:08,429 --> 01:36:10,997
     Baby's right as rain,
     sweetheart.

1573
01:36:11,599 --> 01:36:13,032
         How are you?

1574
01:36:13,034 --> 01:36:16,035
    Oh, I kept my eyes shut
    tight the whole time.

1575
01:36:16,137 --> 01:36:17,737
I didn't want
     to see anything.

1576
01:36:17,739 --> 01:36:21,040
 -Then I asked for them to
 give me something to sleep.
 -Mmm.

1577
01:36:21,042 --> 01:36:22,942
    You know, you've been
    asleep for seven years.

1578
01:36:22,944 --> 01:36:25,378
 -This is your fourth child.
 -Stop it, Lester.

1579
01:36:25,380 --> 01:36:27,747
     It's okay, Harriet.

1580
01:36:27,749 --> 01:36:29,449
         He means well.

1581
01:36:30,484 --> 01:36:30,917
         Sweetheart,

1582
01:36:30,919 --> 01:36:34,988
 the nurse wants to know if
 you'd like to hold the baby.

1583
01:36:38,559 --> 01:36:41,795
     They say it's too easy
     to fall in love.

1584
01:36:43,898 --> 01:36:45,665
         Are you sure?

1585
01:36:49,470 --> 01:36:50,703
             Yeah.

1586
01:36:52,173 --> 01:36:53,973
     But I want Jude to.

1587
01:36:58,112 --> 01:36:59,412
             Now?

1588
01:37:00,881 --> 01:37:02,115
             Yeah.

1589
01:37:04,418 --> 01:37:06,119
        Follow me, Jude.

1590
01:37:14,361 --> 01:37:15,728
         Oh, my girl.

1591
01:37:16,397 --> 01:37:18,398
     My brave, brave girl.

1592
01:37:32,079 --> 01:37:33,680
     You know, I was
     thinking that, uh...

1593
01:37:33,682 --> 01:37:37,016
 You know, if you wanna be
 we could be roommates again.

1594
01:37:37,018 --> 01:37:38,418
      -Really?
      -Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1595
01:37:38,420 --> 01:37:40,720
     I got a lead on
     an apartment that...

1596
01:37:40,722 --> 01:37:44,224
    Looks like it could be
    a lot bigger, you know,
         two rooms.

1597
01:37:44,226 --> 01:37:45,491
  -Yeah, that'd be awesome.
  -Hmm.

1598
01:37:45,493 --> 01:37:48,728
    If a guy's gonna get his
    shit together, you know,
    he needs a little space.

1599
01:37:48,730 --> 01:37:50,930
        And I'm speaking
        for both of us.

1600
01:37:50,932 --> 01:37:52,432
         Here it is.

1601
01:37:58,405 --> 01:38:01,207
I always thought
     he'd look like Teddy.

1602
01:38:02,776 --> 01:38:05,712
      He doesn't look
      like Eliza either.

1603
01:38:07,114 --> 01:38:09,682
 He just looks like himself.

1604
01:38:12,219 --> 01:38:14,888
     You think I'll ever
     see him after this?

1605
01:38:20,194 --> 01:38:24,864
 In 10 years, he's going to be
 a completely different person.

1606
01:38:25,266 --> 01:38:27,367
     And so are you, champ.

1607
01:38:29,603 --> 01:38:32,138
    Go in there. Go say hi.

1608
01:38:37,411 --> 01:38:38,011
There you go.

1609
01:38:38,013 --> 01:38:41,381
- Make sure to
     support his head.

1610
01:38:47,254 --> 01:38:48,922
          It's okay.

1611
01:39:45,145 --> 01:39:47,947
<i> If Teddy hadn't</i>
     <i> left us for good,</i>

1612
01:39:48,115 --> 01:39:52,085
  <i> if he was still somewhere</i>
  <i> up there, 10 years later</i>

1613
01:39:52,087 --> 01:39:56,489
    <i> hovering above the city</i>
    <i> in the troposphere</i>
    <i> of the earth,</i>

1614
01:39:56,724 --> 01:40:00,093
     <i> he'd see a little part</i>
     <i> transformed.</i>

1615
01:40:01,628 --> 01:40:03,930
 <i> He'd find Eliza in Brooklyn,</i>

1616
01:40:03,932 --> 01:40:05,531
    <i> starting her own family.</i>

1617
01:40:05,533 --> 01:40:08,301
     <i> And his best friend,</i>
     <i> believe it or not,</i>

1618
01:40:08,303 --> 01:40:11,804
      <i> about to become</i>
      <i> a father himself.</i>

1619
01:40:13,273 --> 01:40:15,975
     <i> He'd know that he had</i>
     <i> not been forgotten</i>

1620
01:40:15,977 --> 01:40:17,810
     <i> even if the outlines</i>
     <i> of his face</i>

1621
01:40:17,812 --> 01:40:21,280
      <i> grow fuzzier with</i>
      <i> each passing year.</i>

1622
01:40:22,249 --> 01:40:23,750
     <i> Maybe he'd also see</i>

1623
01:40:23,752 --> 01:40:26,819
      <i> how fragile each</i>
      <i> and every life is.</i>

1624
01:40:26,821 --> 01:40:30,523
 <i> And that they all just fall</i>
 <i> to earth and scatter</i>

1625
01:40:30,525 --> 01:40:33,626
     <i> hoping to settle</i>
     <i> somewhere and stick</i>

1626
01:40:34,495 --> 01:40:37,330
    <i> like big, dry snowflakes</i>

1627
01:40:37,598 --> 01:40:39,932
  <i> from a white Vermont sky.</i>
