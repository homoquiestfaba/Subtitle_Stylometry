ls anyone there?

00:01:38,544 --> 00:01:41,934
<i>Early man's struggle for surv</i>i<i>val</i>

00:01:43,504 --> 00:01:46,257
<i>Threats to h</i>i<i>s ex</i>i<i>stence were everywhere.</i>

00:01:46,464 --> 00:01:49,183
l really must switch to decaf.

9
00:02:12,944 --> 00:02:14,013
Professor!

10
00:02:14,904 --> 00:02:16,053
Behind you!

11
00:02:26,224 --> 00:02:27,213
Yikes!

12
00:02:29,784 --> 00:02:31,297
Stay right there!

13
00:02:40,664 --> 00:02:43,019
-Shaggy!
-Now, Scoob!

14
00:02:49,104 --> 00:02:51,299
-The trap worked, Scoob!
-Yeah!

15
00:02:52,704 --> 00:02:53,898
Give me four!

16
00:02:57,704 --> 00:03:01,094
-You're the man, Scoob.
-You're the man.

17
00:04:17,064 --> 00:04:19,100
Nice going, guys. You caught 'em.

18
00:04:20,504 --> 00:04:22,699
Right. No problem, Freddy.

19
00:04:22,864 --> 00:04:24,502
But we had a little help.

20
00:04:24,584 --> 00:04:25,699
Who are you?

21
00:04:26,624 --> 00:04:28,137
l don't believe it!

22
00:04:28,384 --> 00:04:31,615
You're Ben Ravencroft,
the famous horror writer.

23
00:04:32,024 --> 00:04:33,173
That's right.

24
00:04:33,744 --> 00:04:35,735
And let's see who they are.

25
00:04:40,144 --> 00:04:41,497
lt's Perkins.

26
00:04:42,784 --> 00:04:47,778
And Griswold. Disgruntled archaeologists
from the museum's Babylonian project.

27
00:04:48,144 --> 00:04:51,181
They were upset with you
for cutting their funding, Dr. Dean.

28
00:04:51,344 --> 00:04:54,017
And we would have
gotten away with it, too.. .

29
00:04:54,104 --> 00:04:56,902
if it wasn't for this meddling writer!

30
00:05:00,144 --> 00:05:01,623
That's a twist!

31
00:05:01,744 --> 00:05:05,419
Yeah. At least he didn't call us ''kids."
l hate that.

32
00:05:05,664 --> 00:05:08,224
You beat us to the punch, Mr. Ravencroft.

33
00:05:08,664 --> 00:05:11,462
Sorry, l didn't mean to upstage you.

34
00:05:11,584 --> 00:05:13,336
So what were you doing here?

35
00:05:13,424 --> 00:05:15,733
l was doing research on my latest novel.. .

36
00:05:15,824 --> 00:05:18,736
when l saw the archaeologists
acting suspiciously.. .

37
00:05:18,824 --> 00:05:20,496
and decided to investigate.

38
00:05:20,664 --> 00:05:24,543
Mr. Ravencroft,
l am a huge fan of your work.

39
00:05:24,744 --> 00:05:27,781
l've read all your books,
which in my opinion.. .

40
00:05:27,864 --> 00:05:30,094
are the best horror stories ever written.

41
00:05:30,504 --> 00:05:32,301
Thanks, Velma.

42
00:05:33,584 --> 00:05:35,256
You know my name?

43
00:05:35,344 --> 00:05:37,141
And Daphne's and Fred's.

44
00:05:41,824 --> 00:05:43,894
And Scooby and Shaggy, of course.

45
00:05:45,544 --> 00:05:48,183
l've admired your work
unraveling supernatural mysteries.. .

46
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:49,583
for some time now.

47
00:05:49,824 --> 00:05:53,100
We're in the same business
of ''mystery and the occult." Right?

48
00:05:53,384 --> 00:05:54,373
Please.

49
00:05:54,624 --> 00:05:59,334
What we do pales in comparison with
the sheer palpable fright of your novels.

50
00:05:59,904 --> 00:06:03,101
-l wouldn't say that.
-Take <i>The Dead Mal</i>l, for example.

51
00:06:03,184 --> 00:06:07,223
That creepy jewelry-store owner
was an incredibly complex character.

52
00:06:07,304 --> 00:06:08,339
You're very kind.

53
00:06:09,224 --> 00:06:12,261
Listen, Velma,
l'm going back to my hometown.. .

54
00:06:12,424 --> 00:06:14,221
in Massachusetts this weekend.. .

55
00:06:14,384 --> 00:06:16,614
to the house where l wrote
my early books.

56
00:06:16,744 --> 00:06:21,215
l go back every year for the fall color.
lt's very peaceful and relaxing.

57
00:06:21,624 --> 00:06:23,899
Why don't you
and your friends come visit?

58
00:06:24,944 --> 00:06:29,256
Really? That would be great,
wouldn't it, gang?

59
00:06:29,544 --> 00:06:33,173
Yeah. We could use a break
from all these spooky mysteries.

60
00:06:33,464 --> 00:06:38,219
And Oakhaven does have one
of the best restaurants in New England.

61
00:06:38,464 --> 00:06:41,536
-We're sold, eh, Scoob?
-Yeah!

62
00:07:16,984 --> 00:07:19,623
This color is spectacular, right, guys?

63
00:07:20,464 --> 00:07:21,817
-Amazing!
-Yeah!

64
00:07:21,984 --> 00:07:24,020
Don't forget me, old buddy.

65
00:07:39,424 --> 00:07:41,062
And that scene at the end.. .

66
00:07:41,144 --> 00:07:44,420
where the caretaker's flesh dissolved
was so brilliant l--

67
00:07:44,504 --> 00:07:45,778
Look, we're here.

68
00:07:46,184 --> 00:07:47,378
Already?

69
00:07:56,544 --> 00:07:58,262
Welcome to Oakhaven!

70
00:07:58,944 --> 00:07:59,933
What?

71
00:08:01,624 --> 00:08:04,422
l thought you said
this was a quiet little town.

72
00:08:04,504 --> 00:08:05,493
lt was.

73
00:08:05,624 --> 00:08:08,013
This is a pretty popular spot.

74
00:08:10,504 --> 00:08:13,655
Sure, we always get a few leaf peepers,
but never like this.

75
00:08:13,864 --> 00:08:16,537
This is a circus!

76
00:08:17,104 --> 00:08:19,743
There's the mayor.
He'll know what's going on!

77
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:24,974
-Maybe he'll know a place to eat!
-Yeah!

78
00:08:26,384 --> 00:08:28,818
Welcome to old Oakhaven!

79
00:08:28,984 --> 00:08:30,940
Have a wonderful time!

80
00:08:31,824 --> 00:08:33,655
So glad you could come!

81
00:08:33,824 --> 00:08:35,621
Mayor! Mayor Corey!

82
00:08:35,824 --> 00:08:39,658
Ben, my boy!
l'm glad you could come home to see this!

83
00:08:39,744 --> 00:08:43,419
And l see you've brought some friends.
And their dog.

84
00:08:43,664 --> 00:08:45,302
Dog? Where?

85
00:08:46,304 --> 00:08:48,818
Welcome. The more the merrier.

86
00:08:48,904 --> 00:08:50,383
But what is all this?

87
00:08:50,464 --> 00:08:54,662
lt's great, isn't it? Business is booming.
Not like a few months ago.. .

88
00:08:54,864 --> 00:08:57,697
when it was slower than maple syrup
on a cold day!

89
00:08:57,944 --> 00:09:00,583
-Hey, Ben.
-Hi, Mr. McKnight.

90
00:09:00,784 --> 00:09:04,618
Welcome home.
Have a T-shirt before my store sells out!

91
00:09:04,864 --> 00:09:07,583
-You can wear it to the concert tomorrow.
-Concert?

92
00:09:07,704 --> 00:09:08,693
The Hex Girls.

93
00:09:08,784 --> 00:09:10,900
-You've heard of them, Fred?
-Just now.

94
00:09:15,104 --> 00:09:18,779
A local group. You'll like 'em.
Kind of spooky.

95
00:09:19,504 --> 00:09:23,383
''l Met The Ghost of Oakhaven
(and lived)''?

96
00:09:24,024 --> 00:09:25,013
Ghost?

97
00:09:25,104 --> 00:09:28,494
Jinkies, looks like there's a ghost
in your own backyard, Ben.

98
00:09:28,904 --> 00:09:32,374
Not only that, but it's his own ancestor.

99
00:09:32,664 --> 00:09:34,939
The ghost of Sarah Ravencroft.

100
00:09:35,544 --> 00:09:36,943
That's ridiculous.

101
00:09:37,344 --> 00:09:40,097
l thought we'd gotten past
all this witch nonsense.

102
00:09:40,264 --> 00:09:44,576
What can l say, Ben.
Ever since we built our ''Puritan Village''.. .

103
00:09:44,824 --> 00:09:47,054
her ghost has appeared many times.

104
00:09:47,664 --> 00:09:50,815
Don't tell me. You disturbed her spirit
with the construction.

105
00:09:51,064 --> 00:09:53,373
And now, she's haunting the town.

106
00:09:53,544 --> 00:09:54,897
How did you know?

107
00:09:55,144 --> 00:09:57,783
-Ghost hunting's our specialty.
-l see.

108
00:09:58,184 --> 00:10:00,573
Did you say, ''Puritan Village''?

109
00:10:14,944 --> 00:10:19,938
What you're seeing is a perfect re-creation
of what life was like back in the 1600s.. .

110
00:10:20,384 --> 00:10:22,420
as reenacted by our locals.

111
00:10:22,984 --> 00:10:24,736
When did all this go up?

112
00:10:24,864 --> 00:10:26,502
About six months ago.

113
00:10:26,904 --> 00:10:28,622
This is amazing, Mayor!

114
00:10:32,504 --> 00:10:34,574
Corn husk dolls!

115
00:10:34,704 --> 00:10:37,776
-Aren't they cute?
-Yeah, charming.

116
00:10:38,984 --> 00:10:40,019
Look, Scoob.

117
00:10:40,104 --> 00:10:41,856
l've been a bad boy.

118
00:10:49,864 --> 00:10:51,582
Wouldst thou like to churn?

119
00:10:52,944 --> 00:10:55,902
lt's your turn to churn the butter,
old buddy.

120
00:11:18,864 --> 00:11:21,014
Now all we need is the popcorn.

121
00:11:23,704 --> 00:11:26,013
So you say a ghost has been
appearing here?

122
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:30,979
That's right, young lady.
Apparently we disturbed the spirit.. .

123
00:11:31,224 --> 00:11:34,899
of Ben's ancestor,
who was persecuted as a witch.. .

124
00:11:34,984 --> 00:11:36,940
way back in 1657.

125
00:11:37,224 --> 00:11:39,101
Unjustly persecuted.

126
00:11:39,624 --> 00:11:42,980
Sarah Ravencroft was a medicine woman
who practiced natural healing.. .

127
00:11:43,064 --> 00:11:46,181
and was unfairly accused
because of her eccentric ways.

128
00:11:46,384 --> 00:11:48,181
Just like the Salem witch trials.

129
00:11:48,264 --> 00:11:50,539
Many men and women
who were a bit different.. .

130
00:11:50,624 --> 00:11:54,503
or didn't conform to the codes
of the colony suffered the same fate.

131
00:11:55,264 --> 00:11:56,856
Sarah was a healer.

132
00:11:57,064 --> 00:11:59,737
lt was said she even kept a journal
of all the patients.. .

133
00:11:59,824 --> 00:12:01,655
she cured with her herbal remedies.

134
00:12:04,944 --> 00:12:06,263
Look, Shaggy!

135
00:12:11,504 --> 00:12:13,540
lt's a perfect fit, Scoob!

136
00:12:34,264 --> 00:12:35,697
Easy, Scoob.

137
00:12:39,144 --> 00:12:41,214
What do you got there, old buddy?

138
00:12:42,544 --> 00:12:43,533
l don't know!

139
00:12:43,744 --> 00:12:44,938
Wonder what this is.

140
00:12:45,024 --> 00:12:47,982
Looks like you've found
an old shoe buckle, my boy.

141
00:12:48,144 --> 00:12:50,704
Probably over 400 years old.

142
00:12:51,144 --> 00:12:52,213
Cool.

143
00:12:55,104 --> 00:12:58,938
Look for another one,
so l can have a matching pair.

144
00:12:59,024 --> 00:13:00,013
Okay.

145
00:13:00,104 --> 00:13:03,653
We've found all sorts of items
from the old colony.. .

146
00:13:03,744 --> 00:13:06,019
when we cleared this area
for construction.

147
00:13:06,104 --> 00:13:08,937
Handmade nails, horseshoes,
farm equipment.

148
00:13:09,024 --> 00:13:11,584
-How about a book?
-A book?

149
00:13:11,704 --> 00:13:14,935
You know how long l've been searching
for Sarah's journal.. .

150
00:13:15,024 --> 00:13:17,094
to officially clear our family name.

151
00:13:17,504 --> 00:13:19,381
Sorry, Ben. Nothing like that.

152
00:13:19,784 --> 00:13:22,582
What makes you think
it's Sarah's ghost haunting this place?

153
00:13:22,664 --> 00:13:26,703
Because the ghost said so.
Maybe you'll see her tonight.

154
00:13:27,024 --> 00:13:28,980
-Oh, boy.
-You never know, Fred.

155
00:13:31,824 --> 00:13:35,658
We'd like to see a Puritan pizza joint.
We're starved!

156
00:13:35,744 --> 00:13:36,733
Yeah!

157
00:13:37,584 --> 00:13:41,736
Don't worry, boys. We've got
the best restaurant in all New England.

158
00:13:41,944 --> 00:13:44,299
lt's back in town. l'll walk you there.

159
00:13:45,144 --> 00:13:48,216
Do you kids want to go,
or would you like to see my studio?

160
00:13:49,104 --> 00:13:50,219
Would we ever.

161
00:13:50,984 --> 00:13:53,100
Shaggy, we'll meet up with you later.

162
00:13:53,184 --> 00:13:56,938
Mayor, tell Jack
that anything they order is on me.

163
00:13:58,104 --> 00:14:01,096
-What a great guy!
-Yeah, great!

164
00:14:03,904 --> 00:14:06,338
You're gonna regret that offer, Ben.

165
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:23,779
Jack's gonna take good care of you, boys.
You're gonna love his cooking.

166
00:14:23,944 --> 00:14:25,775
l'm sure we will, Your Honor.

167
00:14:25,864 --> 00:14:29,698
-Enjoy your stay at Oakhaven.
-Thanks, your dudeness.

168
00:14:41,304 --> 00:14:45,058
-Well, boys. Are you hungry?
-Man, are we ever.

169
00:14:45,144 --> 00:14:49,660
Come on over here to the back.
l always have a table open for VlPs!

170
00:14:49,744 --> 00:14:50,733
Groovy!

171
00:14:50,824 --> 00:14:51,893
Come on, Scoob!

172
00:14:53,304 --> 00:14:57,422
You're Mr. Ravencroft's guests,
so order up anything on the menu, boys.

173
00:14:57,744 --> 00:15:00,383
l've got a nice, juicy ham bone
for your dog.

174
00:15:01,144 --> 00:15:03,214
-What do you think?
-Bones? Yuck!

175
00:15:05,064 --> 00:15:06,975
Scooby's allergic to bones.

176
00:15:07,064 --> 00:15:09,100
We'll have whatever that great smell is!

177
00:15:09,184 --> 00:15:12,859
That's Yankee pot roast,
New England clam chowder.. .

178
00:15:12,944 --> 00:15:16,061
maple-baked ham and beans,
roast turkey.. .

179
00:15:16,224 --> 00:15:21,059
with chestnut stuffing,
and apple-cinnamon pie.

180
00:15:24,744 --> 00:15:28,020
Sounds great.
Give us two orders of everything.

181
00:15:29,224 --> 00:15:31,454
l love people who love to eat.

182
00:15:37,264 --> 00:15:40,301
So this is where it all started!

183
00:15:41,224 --> 00:15:46,173
Yes, l wrote all my early novels here.
Now l spend most of my time in Europe.

184
00:15:46,264 --> 00:15:49,301
But l come back once a year
to recharge my batteries.

185
00:15:50,264 --> 00:15:52,539
Go ahead, Velma. Sit down.

186
00:15:54,304 --> 00:15:57,740
Jinkies! This is a dream come true.

187
00:15:58,944 --> 00:16:02,016
-You have some cool things here, Ben.
-l'll say.

188
00:16:04,504 --> 00:16:06,142
Whose portrait is this?

189
00:16:06,224 --> 00:16:08,340
This is Sarah Ravencroft.

190
00:16:08,784 --> 00:16:11,014
l think it was painted by a grateful patient.

191
00:16:14,464 --> 00:16:17,342
<i>Of course, she wasn't very popular</i>
<i>w</i>i<i>th the town's doctors.</i>

192
00:16:17,584 --> 00:16:20,417
<i>Sarah was untrad</i>i<i>t</i>i<i>onal</i>
i<i>n her approach to med</i>i<i>c</i>i<i>ne.</i>

193
00:16:20,504 --> 00:16:22,734
<i>-She was a W</i>i<i>ccan.</i>
<i>-Say what?</i>

194
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:26,096
<i>l've read about them.</i>
<i>W</i>i<i>ccans were people who were</i> i<i>n tune...</i>

195
00:16:26,224 --> 00:16:29,455
<i>w</i>i<i>th the forces of nature,</i>
<i>and used them for heal</i>i<i>ng purposes.</i>

196
00:16:29,744 --> 00:16:33,817
<i>Exactly. She bel</i>i<i>eved</i> i<i>n us</i>i<i>ng herbs</i>
<i>and other natural elements...</i>

197
00:16:34,184 --> 00:16:36,778
<i>to draw from the earth's powers</i>
<i>to heal the s</i>i<i>ck.</i>

198
00:16:37,304 --> 00:16:40,614
<i>Sarah helped many people</i>
<i>who could not afford med</i>i<i>cal treatment.</i>

199
00:16:42,504 --> 00:16:45,302
<i>She treated her pat</i>i<i>ents</i>
<i>under a large oak tree...</i>

200
00:16:45,424 --> 00:16:48,894
<i>wh</i>i<i>ch she bel</i>i<i>eved to have</i>
<i>heal</i>i<i>ng powers.</i>

201
00:16:55,344 --> 00:16:59,178
l saw a huge oak tree like that
in the town square.

202
00:16:59,344 --> 00:17:03,132
l've already searched the area around
that tree, but never found anything.

203
00:17:03,504 --> 00:17:05,893
That book could finally prove
Sarah's innocence.. .

204
00:17:05,984 --> 00:17:08,418
and that she was a Wiccan,
not an evil witch.

205
00:17:08,504 --> 00:17:11,462
Wiccans have been misunderstood,
accused of sorcery.

206
00:17:11,744 --> 00:17:14,099
ln fact, the word ''witch''
comes from ''Wicca."

207
00:17:14,184 --> 00:17:15,822
l'm impressed, Velma.

208
00:17:15,984 --> 00:17:18,498
You know, doing research
on Sarah and the Wiccans.. .

209
00:17:18,584 --> 00:17:21,621
led me to read almost everything
on the world of superstition.

210
00:17:21,984 --> 00:17:25,215
That's how l started writing stories
to frighten people.

211
00:17:59,224 --> 00:18:01,055
l've never seen anything like this.

212
00:18:01,144 --> 00:18:03,499
Are you at least tasting my food?

213
00:18:06,144 --> 00:18:08,897
lt's the best food we've ever had.

214
00:18:09,984 --> 00:18:11,975
Delicious!

215
00:18:39,584 --> 00:18:41,893
So, how's the food?

216
00:18:42,584 --> 00:18:44,415
Pretty darn good!

217
00:18:44,544 --> 00:18:46,535
ls there anything left in the kitchen?

218
00:18:46,664 --> 00:18:50,134
l'll be right back, boys.
l've got to make a run to the market.

219
00:18:51,104 --> 00:18:52,457
lt's getting dark, guys.

220
00:18:52,544 --> 00:18:55,104
Let's go see if that ghost
will make an appearance.

221
00:18:56,384 --> 00:18:59,535
We'd love to,
but we haven't had our dessert yet.

222
00:18:59,624 --> 00:19:01,262
Yeah, yeah!

223
00:19:01,344 --> 00:19:05,178
Okay, but after you finish,
meet us at the Puritan Village.

224
00:19:05,624 --> 00:19:07,057
Ben's already gone ahead.

225
00:19:07,984 --> 00:19:12,136
lf the ghost gets there first,
just start screaming without us.

226
00:19:33,344 --> 00:19:36,734
Come on, we've been waiting an hour.
The ghost is a no-show.

227
00:19:37,024 --> 00:19:39,254
Maybe she'll show up
at the concert tomorrow.

228
00:19:41,304 --> 00:19:46,059
Too bad. l was hoping to have
a little chat with my ghostly ancestor.

229
00:19:46,224 --> 00:19:48,977
l wanted to ask her
where she hid her journal.

230
00:19:49,064 --> 00:19:53,421
-Ben is obsessed with that book.
-l'll say.

231
00:19:53,544 --> 00:19:55,296
We should leave, too.

232
00:19:55,624 --> 00:19:57,535
Let's give it a chance, Ben.

233
00:19:57,624 --> 00:20:00,661
Yeah, it's probably
a hokey bed sheet on a wire or something.

234
00:20:00,744 --> 00:20:02,143
This could be funny.

235
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:10,134
Thanks for everything, Jack. lt was great.

236
00:20:10,304 --> 00:20:12,579
Especially those last 12 pies.

237
00:20:13,784 --> 00:20:15,183
Glad you liked them.

238
00:20:20,264 --> 00:20:23,381
-Was that good eating or what, Scoob?
-Yeah!

239
00:20:26,064 --> 00:20:27,383
Excuse me.

240
00:20:28,104 --> 00:20:32,222
Gee, looks like everybody's leaving.
l wonder if the ghost showed up.

241
00:20:38,104 --> 00:20:40,095
With no one here.. .

242
00:20:40,424 --> 00:20:43,063
this place is almost spooky, Scoob.

243
00:20:54,224 --> 00:20:56,374
-Girls!
-Yeah, girls!

244
00:21:02,664 --> 00:21:04,416
Hi, girls.

245
00:21:05,224 --> 00:21:06,577
Hi.

246
00:21:14,704 --> 00:21:16,774
l think we lost them, old buddy.

247
00:21:20,104 --> 00:21:23,301
And l thought there was
only one ghost witch!

248
00:21:23,464 --> 00:21:24,499
Yeah!

249
00:21:24,704 --> 00:21:29,380
Anyway, with all that running
we worked off that big meal.

250
00:21:29,664 --> 00:21:32,462
But you know, now l'm hungry again.

251
00:21:32,744 --> 00:21:33,813
Me, too.

252
00:21:43,704 --> 00:21:47,538
This town shall pay for what it did to me!

253
00:21:57,144 --> 00:21:59,738
lt's every coward for himself, old buddy!

254
00:22:03,144 --> 00:22:05,612
-What's going on, guys?
-''Rhost! ''

255
00:22:05,784 --> 00:22:06,899
A roast?

256
00:22:09,824 --> 00:22:13,100
-Witch's ghost!
-You saw the witch's ghost?

257
00:22:13,264 --> 00:22:14,253
Yeah.

258
00:22:19,744 --> 00:22:21,018
Can you show us where?

259
00:22:21,104 --> 00:22:24,380
Do we have to? She throws fireballs, man.

260
00:22:25,464 --> 00:22:28,262
Can you at least get off me first, Freddy?

261
00:22:28,504 --> 00:22:30,495
Gee, sorry, Daph.

262
00:22:33,424 --> 00:22:35,813
Down this street.

263
00:22:40,624 --> 00:22:42,580
There's no one here now.

264
00:22:42,664 --> 00:22:45,861
We thought we'd gotten away
from the first three witches.. .

265
00:22:46,264 --> 00:22:49,222
when this ghost chased us
from down there!

266
00:22:49,464 --> 00:22:51,102
First three witches?

267
00:22:52,264 --> 00:22:54,698
You said she threw fireballs, right?

268
00:22:55,264 --> 00:22:59,416
lt was like this, Velma,
but a thousand times worse!

269
00:22:59,944 --> 00:23:03,698
-ls this the street she chased you down?
-Don't remind us!

270
00:23:07,304 --> 00:23:09,295
Check out these branches!

271
00:23:09,944 --> 00:23:12,378
They were all broken
from the tops of these trees!

272
00:23:12,464 --> 00:23:14,819
And in a perfectly straight line.

273
00:23:15,024 --> 00:23:17,174
This is getting interesting, Ben.

274
00:23:21,944 --> 00:23:24,697
-Shaggy!
-Not again!

275
00:23:25,304 --> 00:23:26,498
What is that?

276
00:23:27,904 --> 00:23:29,462
Let's go see!

277
00:23:47,624 --> 00:23:49,262
Hit it, sisters.

278
00:23:51,704 --> 00:23:54,264
Zoinks! lt's the witches!

279
00:23:54,824 --> 00:23:56,974
Easy, guys! lt's just the Hex Girls.

280
00:25:38,744 --> 00:25:41,019
Thanks. What are you doing here?

281
00:25:41,384 --> 00:25:43,022
The concert's tomorrow.

282
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:46,581
Hey, wait a minute.

283
00:25:47,104 --> 00:25:48,856
Aren't you Ben Ravencroft?

284
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:52,702
Why? You're not gonna bite me, are you?

285
00:25:52,824 --> 00:25:55,577
Cool. l've always wanted to meet you.

286
00:25:56,344 --> 00:25:58,414
You're like one of us.

287
00:25:58,504 --> 00:26:01,496
Yeah, you understand what we're into.

288
00:26:05,384 --> 00:26:06,578
Hi.

289
00:26:07,904 --> 00:26:09,860
That's quite an act, Miss.. ..

290
00:26:10,144 --> 00:26:14,581
Thorn. This is Dusk and Luna.
We're Eco-Goths.

291
00:26:14,664 --> 00:26:16,017
Eco-Goths?

292
00:26:16,104 --> 00:26:17,935
And we don't need your approval.

293
00:26:18,424 --> 00:26:22,975
Gee, all those explosions at the end
were pretty mystifying, eh, Velma?

294
00:26:23,064 --> 00:26:25,419
Yeah, very mystifying.

295
00:26:25,544 --> 00:26:30,493
-So, where are you girls from?
-Oakhaven, but we won't be here for long.

296
00:26:30,664 --> 00:26:34,737
We're close to cutting our first CD.
Well, it's been killer meeting you.

297
00:26:34,824 --> 00:26:35,813
Same here.

298
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:38,099
But we've got to get back to our rehearsal.

299
00:26:43,504 --> 00:26:46,098
Those Hex Girls seem kind of suspicious.

300
00:26:46,384 --> 00:26:49,057
-l'll say.
-Daph and l should keep an eye on them.

301
00:26:49,184 --> 00:26:52,938
Gee, why is it that you always
pair off with Daphne?

302
00:26:54,024 --> 00:26:56,584
-Well.. ..
-Never mind. lt's a good idea.

303
00:26:56,784 --> 00:27:00,459
You two stay here. l'll take another look
at where the guys saw that ghost.

304
00:27:01,944 --> 00:27:03,093
Come on.

305
00:27:11,504 --> 00:27:13,495
Let's take a look behind these trees.

306
00:27:20,224 --> 00:27:22,738
What are all these tire tracks
doing back here?

307
00:27:22,864 --> 00:27:24,980
Strange. The road's back there.

308
00:27:25,064 --> 00:27:28,022
Right. Let's see where these tracks lead.

309
00:27:28,144 --> 00:27:32,023
Can't we follow them tomorrow
after breakfast?

310
00:27:32,944 --> 00:27:34,536
l guess not.

311
00:27:53,944 --> 00:27:56,094
Jinkies! lt's the mayor.

312
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:58,182
What's he doing here?

313
00:27:58,984 --> 00:28:02,101
l don't know, but we're gonna find out
what's in that barn.

314
00:28:02,664 --> 00:28:05,736
-Scooby and Shaggy will follow the mayor.
-We will?

315
00:28:05,824 --> 00:28:09,578
Fine. Then you search the barn,
and we'll follow the mayor.

316
00:28:12,464 --> 00:28:15,217
On second thought, we'll take the mayor.

317
00:28:15,304 --> 00:28:18,102
He'll never know we're on his tail,
eh, Scoob?

318
00:28:23,744 --> 00:28:24,859
Sorry, Scoob.

319
00:29:10,824 --> 00:29:13,179
There's got to be another way in here.

320
00:29:17,864 --> 00:29:22,016
So, Freddy, why do you always pair us up?

321
00:29:23,104 --> 00:29:26,733
Well, l've thought about that
for the longest time, and.. .

322
00:29:26,904 --> 00:29:29,293
there's never been a good time to tell you.

323
00:29:30,064 --> 00:29:31,543
Maybe it's time that l.. .

324
00:29:31,904 --> 00:29:32,939
that l.. ..

325
00:29:33,744 --> 00:29:35,143
Hey, here they come.

326
00:29:39,064 --> 00:29:42,898
l think we're going to need
to perform our ritual, girls.

327
00:29:43,384 --> 00:29:44,976
Not tonight, Thorn.

328
00:29:45,384 --> 00:29:48,103
My powers are weak from rehearsing.

329
00:29:48,264 --> 00:29:51,620
Mine, too. How about tomorrow
just before the concert?

330
00:29:51,904 --> 00:29:54,623
Never mind. l'll do it myself.

331
00:29:55,184 --> 00:29:58,301
See you in the morning.
Bad dreams, sisters.

332
00:29:58,584 --> 00:30:01,018
Bad dreams, sister Thorn.

333
00:30:04,144 --> 00:30:08,057
Did you hear that, Daph? Those girls
have something to do with this ghost.

334
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:09,783
l'm sure of it.

335
00:30:09,864 --> 00:30:12,458
Thorn seems like the leader.
Let's follow her.

336
00:30:12,544 --> 00:30:16,014
Are you're sure
you're not just stuck on Thorn?

337
00:30:23,584 --> 00:30:24,858
Just a little higher.

338
00:30:25,544 --> 00:30:26,818
l can't.

339
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:31,139
-That's great.
-Wonderful.

340
00:30:32,264 --> 00:30:33,379
l'm in.

341
00:30:36,344 --> 00:30:38,141
Velma, are you okay?

342
00:30:39,544 --> 00:30:40,613
Fine.

343
00:30:42,344 --> 00:30:43,379
Come on.

344
00:30:50,904 --> 00:30:53,976
-This Mayor is one busy guy.
-Yeah.

345
00:30:54,744 --> 00:30:58,180
Okay, Willard. You take it easy, now.

346
00:31:08,224 --> 00:31:09,543
Young love.

347
00:31:32,384 --> 00:31:33,942
lt's still warm, Ben.

348
00:31:34,024 --> 00:31:36,822
But who would be driving it
this late at night?

349
00:31:36,904 --> 00:31:38,303
That's the mystery.

350
00:32:25,824 --> 00:32:26,893
What's she up to?

351
00:32:26,984 --> 00:32:28,542
lf l didn't know better.. .

352
00:32:29,264 --> 00:32:31,334
l'd say she was a witch.

353
00:32:58,424 --> 00:33:01,063
He won't ditch us that easily, Scoob!

354
00:33:18,384 --> 00:33:22,093
-Where do you think he went, Scoob?
-l don't know.

355
00:33:24,464 --> 00:33:27,934
How dare you disturb my resting place!

356
00:33:29,824 --> 00:33:32,292
This town will pay!

357
00:33:34,704 --> 00:33:37,855
Send them a bill. But leave us alone!

358
00:33:57,864 --> 00:34:01,823
-l can't see a thing without my glasses.
-Me either.

359
00:34:02,944 --> 00:34:04,093
Oh, sorry.

360
00:34:08,744 --> 00:34:10,097
-Sorry.
-Sorry.

361
00:34:11,944 --> 00:34:15,778
-Hey, what's going on?
-Ask Scooby and Shaggy.

362
00:34:15,904 --> 00:34:18,657
-Where are they?
-That's no mystery.

363
00:34:20,864 --> 00:34:22,502
So what happened, guys?

364
00:34:23,224 --> 00:34:25,977
We followed the mayor
to some warehouse.. .

365
00:34:26,184 --> 00:34:28,175
and that ghost attacked us!

366
00:34:28,304 --> 00:34:31,740
He did?
There goes my cherry picker theory.

367
00:34:31,904 --> 00:34:35,419
Cherry picker theory? Wait till you hear
what we saw at Thorn's place.

368
00:34:35,704 --> 00:34:39,379
Hey! We were reporting first,
right, Scoob?

369
00:34:40,144 --> 00:34:43,659
The mayor's one busy guy.
Picking things up.. .

370
00:34:45,064 --> 00:34:47,100
and dropping things off.

371
00:34:47,224 --> 00:34:48,339
Like what?

372
00:34:48,504 --> 00:34:50,540
What is going on here?

373
00:34:50,904 --> 00:34:53,099
What's the big idea of running over me?

374
00:34:55,944 --> 00:35:00,335
As you can see, there's nothing here
except a damaged wall.

375
00:35:02,704 --> 00:35:04,501
Sorry about that, Mayor.

376
00:35:04,744 --> 00:35:07,497
Scooby and Shaggy just lose it
when they get scared.

377
00:35:07,664 --> 00:35:10,815
ln fact, l'm worried
that staying in Oakhaven.. .

378
00:35:10,904 --> 00:35:13,862
might just be too frightening
an experience for them.

379
00:35:14,104 --> 00:35:15,742
l think we should leave.

380
00:35:16,744 --> 00:35:17,733
Really?

381
00:35:19,584 --> 00:35:21,939
l'm sorry to hear that.

382
00:35:22,224 --> 00:35:26,263
But l need to get one more clue
before the night is over.

383
00:35:27,864 --> 00:35:31,300
Then l think l can solve the mystery
of the witch's ghost.. .

384
00:35:31,464 --> 00:35:33,341
before tomorrow's Autumn Fest.

385
00:35:33,784 --> 00:35:37,538
Great. l'll do anything l can to help.

386
00:35:43,384 --> 00:35:45,978
l should've known
leaving wasn't an option.

387
00:35:46,784 --> 00:35:48,695
What was that all about, Velma?

388
00:35:49,064 --> 00:35:50,861
You've got a plan, right?

389
00:35:52,504 --> 00:35:54,301
Here's what we're going to do.. ..

390
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:14,493
Hey!

391
00:36:16,504 --> 00:36:17,493
Sorry.

392
00:36:19,464 --> 00:36:21,261
Why'd you stop, old buddy?

393
00:36:22,264 --> 00:36:24,334
No one touches my keyboard!

394
00:36:30,304 --> 00:36:31,896
Thanks for coming, girls.

395
00:36:31,984 --> 00:36:34,817
We should all be home
resting for the concert tomorrow.

396
00:36:35,224 --> 00:36:37,613
We only came because Ben asked us to.

397
00:36:38,104 --> 00:36:40,379
Hey, l'm just following orders.

398
00:36:40,624 --> 00:36:42,421
Well, what do you want?

399
00:36:59,344 --> 00:37:02,302
The town must pay for its foul deed!

400
00:37:13,424 --> 00:37:16,780
Help me! l've fallen and l can't get up!

401
00:37:20,704 --> 00:37:21,693
Now!

402
00:37:25,944 --> 00:37:26,933
Yes!

403
00:37:31,064 --> 00:37:32,497
You did it, guys!

404
00:37:35,024 --> 00:37:37,618
Okay, let's see who's behind all this.

405
00:37:40,744 --> 00:37:44,862
-lt's the T-shirt guy!
-Mr. McKnight the pharmacist?

406
00:37:47,784 --> 00:37:48,853
Daddy?

407
00:37:50,944 --> 00:37:52,263
Hello, Sally.

408
00:37:53,144 --> 00:37:54,816
Your dad's the ghost?

409
00:37:55,024 --> 00:37:56,616
Your name is Sally?

410
00:37:56,824 --> 00:38:00,499
l don't believe this, Daddy.
Why would you do something like this?

411
00:38:00,664 --> 00:38:02,416
You mean you didn't know?

412
00:38:04,024 --> 00:38:06,094
The girls have nothing to do with this.

413
00:38:06,184 --> 00:38:08,982
What in the world
is going on this evening?

414
00:38:10,344 --> 00:38:11,902
ls that you, McKnight?

415
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:13,623
Maybe l can explain.

416
00:38:13,864 --> 00:38:17,573
l found flash powder residue
where Shag and Scoob saw the ghost.

417
00:38:17,704 --> 00:38:22,220
This is a device to throw the fireball,
which are just wads of flash paper.

418
00:38:22,384 --> 00:38:24,614
He got it from his daughter's stage props.

419
00:38:28,704 --> 00:38:30,137
What's that?

420
00:38:31,864 --> 00:38:35,061
lt's the cherry picker
that made the ghost fly above the trees.. .

421
00:38:35,144 --> 00:38:37,374
with the use of an extension device.

422
00:38:37,464 --> 00:38:40,456
And there's the fan
that created the eerie wind.

423
00:38:40,904 --> 00:38:43,816
lt took more than one person
to pull off this scam.

424
00:38:44,064 --> 00:38:45,736
lsn't that right, Jack?

425
00:38:49,424 --> 00:38:53,258
lt would take someone pretty strong
to hoist Mr. McKnight around.

426
00:38:53,584 --> 00:38:57,338
You should have been making pot roast
instead of cooking up trouble!

427
00:38:57,584 --> 00:39:00,701
-That goes for all of you!
-All of you?

428
00:39:01,424 --> 00:39:05,463
Sure, there had to be more people
involved to make this hoax work.

429
00:39:05,744 --> 00:39:09,259
But l, for one,
am totally shocked by this deception.

430
00:39:09,384 --> 00:39:11,818
You can stop the charade now, Mayor.

431
00:39:11,904 --> 00:39:15,260
Because you're the one who made me
suspicious from the beginning.

432
00:39:16,824 --> 00:39:19,133
l am very disappointed in you, Mayor.

433
00:39:19,504 --> 00:39:20,573
And all of you.

434
00:39:20,984 --> 00:39:25,216
For lining your pockets by dragging
Sarah Ravencroft's name through the mud.

435
00:39:34,064 --> 00:39:35,702
So she was a real Wiccan?

436
00:39:35,864 --> 00:39:38,503
-That's right.
-So cool.

437
00:39:38,944 --> 00:39:41,174
She's beautiful.

438
00:39:41,304 --> 00:39:43,579
Yes, l think so, too.

439
00:39:43,944 --> 00:39:47,095
That's why l get upset
when people accuse her of being a witch.

440
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:52,536
l think l owe you girls an apology
for thinking you were.. ..

441
00:39:52,744 --> 00:39:53,733
Witches.

442
00:39:53,824 --> 00:39:56,975
We saw you perform
some kind of ritual in your shed.

443
00:39:57,184 --> 00:40:01,336
Witches? We just pretend that stuff.
lt's just a gimmick for our band.

444
00:40:01,944 --> 00:40:04,742
We're Eco-Goths. Kind of like Wiccans.

445
00:40:05,224 --> 00:40:06,737
Just ask Thorn. She is one.

446
00:40:07,944 --> 00:40:12,062
Yeah, right. Sally McKnight,
one-sixteenth blood on my mother's side.

447
00:40:12,424 --> 00:40:16,576
That ritual you saw was just peppermint
and cloves to soothe my vocal cords.

448
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:18,700
You think it's easy singing this stuff?

449
00:40:18,904 --> 00:40:23,375
Thorn's herbal vapor is awesome.
We all use it before and after every show.

450
00:40:23,744 --> 00:40:25,336
What about your fangs?

451
00:40:25,544 --> 00:40:26,738
My dad's a dentist.

452
00:40:27,944 --> 00:40:29,457
He outfitted the band.

453
00:40:33,664 --> 00:40:37,100
We knew it all along, right, Scoob?

454
00:40:38,584 --> 00:40:39,573
Yikes!

455
00:40:47,744 --> 00:40:48,779
Mayor?

456
00:40:49,104 --> 00:40:52,335
We've been ringing your door bell
for some time and.. ..

457
00:40:52,424 --> 00:40:55,734
Sorry about that. l've been meaning
to fix that thing for years.

458
00:40:55,864 --> 00:40:57,058
What's up, Mayor?

459
00:40:57,944 --> 00:41:01,141
l feel real bad about everything,
and l wanted to apologize.. .

460
00:41:01,264 --> 00:41:04,574
for using your ancestor
in our little publicity stunt.

461
00:41:04,744 --> 00:41:07,975
The tourist trade was so slow
we were desperate.

462
00:41:08,224 --> 00:41:12,854
And you once told me that supernatural
phenomena always attracts people.

463
00:41:12,984 --> 00:41:15,737
lt was just natural to use Sarah because.. .

464
00:41:16,344 --> 00:41:18,539
we accidentally dug up her grave.

465
00:41:18,824 --> 00:41:19,973
What grave?

466
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:21,543
l'm sorry, Ben.. .

467
00:41:21,744 --> 00:41:25,259
but l lied to you when you asked me
if we found anything of Sarah's.. .

468
00:41:25,344 --> 00:41:27,619
while building the Puritan Village.

469
00:41:27,744 --> 00:41:30,781
We did. lt was her grave marker.

470
00:41:30,864 --> 00:41:33,537
We found it in a bulldozed pile
of dirt and rocks.

471
00:41:34,064 --> 00:41:38,182
-We didn't want to upset you.
-But that's all we found. No bones.

472
00:41:38,784 --> 00:41:40,103
No book?

473
00:41:40,264 --> 00:41:43,813
Nothing but that grave marker.
We swear, Ben.

474
00:41:43,984 --> 00:41:46,339
We don't even know where her grave is.

475
00:41:46,464 --> 00:41:49,183
lt's true. lt could be anywhere
between Miller's Creek.. .

476
00:41:49,264 --> 00:41:50,697
and the big tree stump.

477
00:41:57,064 --> 00:42:00,739
Shaggy, do you still have that
little shoe buckle Scooby found today?

478
00:42:01,304 --> 00:42:03,420
Like, this one? Here.

479
00:42:10,704 --> 00:42:13,582
Scooby, can you show me
exactly where you found this?

480
00:42:13,664 --> 00:42:14,813
l think so!

481
00:42:31,144 --> 00:42:35,217
All these years, l was searching
around the wrong oak tree.

482
00:42:35,304 --> 00:42:36,373
Right.

483
00:42:36,464 --> 00:42:40,139
l believe this is what's left of the tree
where Sarah did her healing.

484
00:42:40,544 --> 00:42:44,457
You never even noticed it, because
it was cut down hundreds of years ago.

485
00:42:45,704 --> 00:42:47,774
You've got to dig deeper, Scooby.

486
00:42:48,904 --> 00:42:51,054
How about for a Scooby Snack?

487
00:42:53,184 --> 00:42:54,253
No way.

488
00:42:54,824 --> 00:42:56,303
Two Scooby Snax?

489
00:42:57,784 --> 00:42:58,853
Okay!

490
00:43:15,184 --> 00:43:17,175
-What did you find?
-''Rox! ''

491
00:43:17,424 --> 00:43:18,413
Rocks?

492
00:43:20,784 --> 00:43:21,534
A box!

493
00:43:27,584 --> 00:43:31,657
-Ben, are you okay?
-Just a little excited.

494
00:43:37,424 --> 00:43:40,814
Looks kind of evil
to belong to a Wiccan healer.

495
00:43:43,384 --> 00:43:46,660
Ben, that doesn't seem to be
a journal at all.

496
00:43:47,304 --> 00:43:51,013
Because it isn't, Velma. lt's a spell book!

497
00:43:52,624 --> 00:43:55,343
You see, Sarah wasn't a Wiccan.

498
00:43:55,664 --> 00:43:58,462
She was, indeed, a witch!

499
00:44:00,944 --> 00:44:03,697
-A real witch?
-Heavy.

500
00:44:04,104 --> 00:44:08,495
And since Sarah's blood runs in my veins.. .

501
00:44:08,704 --> 00:44:12,492
l guess that makes me a warlock!

502
00:44:13,104 --> 00:44:14,378
Warlock?

503
00:44:14,544 --> 00:44:18,139
The Wiccans imprisoned Sarah
in her own spell book.. .

504
00:44:18,384 --> 00:44:21,376
and you helped me find it.

505
00:44:21,784 --> 00:44:23,342
You lied to me, Ben.

506
00:44:23,664 --> 00:44:27,543
Well, gee, l had to.
l'd been searching for years.

507
00:44:27,864 --> 00:44:30,332
Then l read about your exploits.

508
00:44:31,864 --> 00:44:34,662
<i>l knew</i> i<i>f anyone could help me</i>
<i>f</i>i<i>nd the book...</i>

509
00:44:34,744 --> 00:44:37,019
i<i>t was you and your fr</i>i<i>ends.</i>

510
00:44:37,264 --> 00:44:40,256
<i>l orchestrated</i>
<i>the whole mummy scheme...</i>

511
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:43,734
<i>pay</i>i<i>ng off the archaeolog</i>i<i>sts</i>
<i>and the secur</i>i<i>ty guards...</i>

512
00:44:43,824 --> 00:44:47,897
<i>just to lure you to the museum,</i>
<i>so we could meet.</i>

513
00:44:51,344 --> 00:44:55,257
l tricked you into helping me,
and it worked.

514
00:44:55,784 --> 00:44:58,093
And you were in on Ben's plan, too.

515
00:44:58,624 --> 00:45:01,457
No. We're as surprised as you are. Honest.

516
00:45:01,624 --> 00:45:03,296
For once he's telling the truth.

517
00:45:03,384 --> 00:45:06,740
That stupid fake ghost
was the town's idea.

518
00:45:07,024 --> 00:45:09,743
But it did work to my advantage.

519
00:45:10,024 --> 00:45:14,302
Why go through this elaborate scheme?
Why not just ask us to find the book?

520
00:45:14,584 --> 00:45:15,573
l know why.

521
00:45:15,664 --> 00:45:19,213
Because if we knew what that book was,
we would never have helped him.

522
00:45:19,584 --> 00:45:23,099
But even you can't imagine
the real power of this book.

523
00:45:23,464 --> 00:45:25,932
No mere mortal can.

524
00:45:26,424 --> 00:45:29,700
You've been reading too many
of your own horror stories, Ravencroft.

525
00:45:29,784 --> 00:45:32,173
A typical mortal response.

526
00:45:32,424 --> 00:45:35,780
But l am descended from a superior breed.

527
00:45:36,384 --> 00:45:41,333
l shall unlock the power
of the imprisoned Sarah Ravencroft!

528
00:45:42,144 --> 00:45:45,454
-l don't like the sound of this!
-Me either!

529
00:45:45,704 --> 00:45:48,616
Together we shall reign supreme.

530
00:45:49,344 --> 00:45:52,336
''Let the evil from the past

531
00:45:52,984 --> 00:45:55,896
''Breathe again with fiery blast

532
00:46:02,864 --> 00:46:06,174
''Let the dark wind whip the night

533
00:46:06,944 --> 00:46:10,061
''To blow away the force of light''

534
00:46:10,464 --> 00:46:14,252
l know what comes next, buddy.
Big trouble!

535
00:46:17,304 --> 00:46:20,933
''Now l summon ancient power''

536
00:46:24,984 --> 00:46:27,179
Ben, please stop!

537
00:46:28,384 --> 00:46:32,935
''This is evil's finest hour''

538
00:46:40,664 --> 00:46:42,461
What's the matter, Velma?

539
00:46:42,624 --> 00:46:45,696
Don't you like the new,
improved Ben Ravencroft?

540
00:46:46,024 --> 00:46:47,901
No. Frankly, l don't.

541
00:46:48,264 --> 00:46:50,903
Well, get used to it.

542
00:46:53,584 --> 00:46:55,381
Leaving so soon?

543
00:46:57,384 --> 00:46:59,420
The party's just beginning!

544
00:47:02,624 --> 00:47:03,773
Help!

545
00:47:04,064 --> 00:47:05,702
Let us out!

546
00:47:06,024 --> 00:47:07,139
Daddy!

547
00:47:07,984 --> 00:47:10,214
How deeply moving!

548
00:47:18,464 --> 00:47:21,183
Can l spin a yarn, or what?

549
00:47:21,304 --> 00:47:23,772
How could l have ever liked your novels?

550
00:47:23,944 --> 00:47:26,538
Now, guys! Grab the book!

551
00:47:31,304 --> 00:47:33,181
-Where'd he go?
-l don't know.

552
00:47:39,424 --> 00:47:43,463
This isn't one of your silly little mysteries.

553
00:47:43,784 --> 00:47:47,663
You can't solve me so easily.

554
00:47:57,904 --> 00:48:00,816
You won't get away with this,
Ben Ravencroft!

555
00:48:01,144 --> 00:48:04,739
Why? Because of you meddling kids?

556
00:48:05,104 --> 00:48:06,822
Hey, we're not kids.

557
00:48:07,024 --> 00:48:09,174
But enough of this minor magic.

558
00:48:09,744 --> 00:48:13,942
l want to see how powerful l can really be.

559
00:48:14,144 --> 00:48:17,659
lt's time to summon Sarah Ravencroft!

560
00:48:18,464 --> 00:48:21,854
''Dreadful darkness, hear my cry

561
00:48:22,104 --> 00:48:25,221
''Bring back one who cannot die''

562
00:48:31,104 --> 00:48:33,220
Are we ever glad to see you!

563
00:48:36,944 --> 00:48:38,218
Nice going, guys!

564
00:48:38,384 --> 00:48:41,296
We're going, all right.
Away from Witchville!

565
00:48:49,864 --> 00:48:54,494
-We've got to go back for the book.
-Can't we wait for the movie?

566
00:49:00,984 --> 00:49:02,656
You're the man, Scoob!

567
00:49:17,024 --> 00:49:18,855
Not the gift shop!

568
00:49:32,024 --> 00:49:34,743
l'm starting to get the hang of this.

569
00:49:54,784 --> 00:49:57,856
Well, at least we still have one tire.

570
00:50:02,784 --> 00:50:03,899
l'll take that.

571
00:50:07,824 --> 00:50:10,463
Now, where was l?

572
00:50:11,504 --> 00:50:15,213
''Dreadful darkness, hear my cry

573
00:50:15,584 --> 00:50:19,020
''Bring back one who cannot die

574
00:50:19,344 --> 00:50:21,812
''Let the witch who perished here

575
00:50:22,424 --> 00:50:25,302
''Live again and reappear! ''

576
00:50:58,624 --> 00:51:00,694
ln my wildest dreams.. .

577
00:51:01,064 --> 00:51:05,103
l could never have imagined
such an imposing creature.

578
00:51:05,784 --> 00:51:10,221
Thank thee. Thou canst not know
what my bondage hath been like.

579
00:51:10,744 --> 00:51:11,859
Who art thou?

580
00:51:12,024 --> 00:51:15,539
Ben Ravencroft. Your descendent.. .

581
00:51:15,624 --> 00:51:17,137
from the modern world.

582
00:51:17,344 --> 00:51:18,333
Modern?

583
00:51:19,584 --> 00:51:21,939
Not much seems to have changed.

584
00:51:22,864 --> 00:51:24,695
Please don't hurt us!

585
00:51:25,384 --> 00:51:30,253
The same pathetic peasants
groveling for their puny lives.

586
00:51:32,184 --> 00:51:35,972
Sarah, l want to become more powerful.

587
00:51:36,384 --> 00:51:37,578
Like you.

588
00:51:40,544 --> 00:51:41,897
Thou jest.

589
00:51:42,384 --> 00:51:44,579
But it was l who released you.

590
00:51:44,664 --> 00:51:46,655
You should serve me.

591
00:51:47,304 --> 00:51:49,056
l serve no one!

592
00:51:49,744 --> 00:51:52,577
Leastwise a worm like thee.

593
00:51:52,984 --> 00:51:55,782
Aye, thou hast freed me.. .

594
00:51:55,864 --> 00:51:59,334
so l can punish the world
for my long imprisonment.

595
00:52:10,624 --> 00:52:14,412
l shall create an era of darkness
over this land.

596
00:52:18,224 --> 00:52:20,101
We're goners, Scoob.

597
00:52:30,304 --> 00:52:32,135
This isn't what l envisioned.

598
00:52:32,344 --> 00:52:36,178
We were supposed
to rule the world together. Not destroy it.

599
00:52:36,504 --> 00:52:39,098
l care not for thy whims.

600
00:52:39,304 --> 00:52:43,582
Cross my path and l shall destroy thee
along with thy world.

601
00:52:44,024 --> 00:52:46,140
But l have the book!

602
00:52:46,704 --> 00:52:50,379
And l will return you back into the book.

603
00:52:51,424 --> 00:52:53,335
''Ancient evil get thee hence

604
00:52:53,904 --> 00:52:57,419
''Only good can recompense
All that's good--''

605
00:53:00,944 --> 00:53:02,775
Thinkest thou art a Wiccan?

606
00:53:03,184 --> 00:53:06,176
Only a virtuous soul can imprison me.

607
00:53:12,344 --> 00:53:13,857
Let me out!

608
00:53:14,984 --> 00:53:16,576
l've got an idea, guys.

609
00:53:16,664 --> 00:53:18,336
But we still need that book.

610
00:53:19,304 --> 00:53:20,862
Not again.

611
00:53:20,984 --> 00:53:23,544
l'm sorry, guys,
but you two are the fastest.

612
00:53:24,024 --> 00:53:25,662
No way!

613
00:53:26,984 --> 00:53:29,339
Don't worry.
We'll create a diversion for you.

614
00:53:29,704 --> 00:53:31,103
No way!

615
00:53:31,184 --> 00:53:33,618
How about for a whole box
of Scooby Snax?

616
00:53:34,064 --> 00:53:35,702
-A whole box?
-A whole box?

617
00:53:38,344 --> 00:53:39,459
Good luck.

618
00:53:41,184 --> 00:53:43,778
Hey, broom rider! Over here!

619
00:53:44,424 --> 00:53:47,461
Thou shalt pay for thine impudence!

620
00:53:52,784 --> 00:53:54,536
l guess snack time's over!

621
00:53:57,904 --> 00:54:01,021
Four hundred years
hasn't helped your aim, lady!

622
00:54:02,584 --> 00:54:05,496
Thy mockery shall be thy last!

623
00:54:35,064 --> 00:54:37,578
No! Let me out!

624
00:54:39,984 --> 00:54:42,452
This is almost too easy!

625
00:54:43,464 --> 00:54:45,216
The book cannot help thee!

626
00:54:48,704 --> 00:54:51,821
Do my bidding, bird! Get them !

627
00:54:52,464 --> 00:54:56,377
A turkey? Even we're not scared of that!

628
00:54:57,944 --> 00:54:59,741
Now we are!

629
00:55:15,224 --> 00:55:16,418
Daphne!

630
00:55:18,024 --> 00:55:19,139
Don't worry!

631
00:55:22,664 --> 00:55:23,653
Help!

632
00:55:23,744 --> 00:55:24,733
Jinkies!

633
00:55:57,304 --> 00:56:00,740
l believe thou hast something
that is mine!

634
00:56:13,464 --> 00:56:16,342
-Got the stuffing, Scoob?
-Yeah!

635
00:56:16,424 --> 00:56:18,938
Time to baste this bird!

636
00:56:22,424 --> 00:56:25,655
l guess he didn't have the right stuff,
old buddy!

637
00:56:37,104 --> 00:56:39,015
Wait for me, Scoob!

638
00:56:45,544 --> 00:56:46,579
Hurry!

639
00:56:47,224 --> 00:56:52,059
-Thanks! l'm out of here!
-Yeah, that witch is the real thing.

640
00:56:52,144 --> 00:56:56,137
-Wait, Thorn. We need your help.
-Me? What can l do?

641
00:56:56,304 --> 00:56:59,819
We need you to read that spell
to defeat Sarah Ravencroft.

642
00:56:59,984 --> 00:57:02,214
Are you crazy? l told you.. .

643
00:57:02,464 --> 00:57:05,615
l'm not really a witch.
l can't help you against her!

644
00:57:05,704 --> 00:57:07,899
But you said you were part Wiccan, right?

645
00:57:08,024 --> 00:57:09,298
Only one-sixteenth.

646
00:57:09,704 --> 00:57:12,093
lt doesn't matter.
You still have Wiccan blood.

647
00:57:12,184 --> 00:57:15,859
Which means only you can read the spell
that will send Sarah Ravencroft.. .

648
00:57:15,944 --> 00:57:17,457
back where she came from.

649
00:57:17,544 --> 00:57:20,263
Forget it. You don't even have the book.

650
00:57:20,424 --> 00:57:22,380
No, Scooby does.

651
00:57:25,784 --> 00:57:27,456
Scooby! Over here!

652
00:57:31,104 --> 00:57:33,664
Give me my book, meddling hound!

653
00:57:33,864 --> 00:57:35,456
Hound? Where?

654
00:57:39,104 --> 00:57:41,493
Let my buddy go, you creepy crone!

655
00:57:44,664 --> 00:57:46,461
What was that?

656
00:57:46,624 --> 00:57:48,182
You're not melting.

657
00:57:48,424 --> 00:57:50,733
lt worked in <i>The W</i>i<i>zard of Oz</i>!

658
00:57:51,584 --> 00:57:54,781
Fool! l shall destroy thee!

659
00:58:06,304 --> 00:58:08,101
The book!

660
00:58:11,304 --> 00:58:12,896
l'll hold that for you.

661
00:58:24,184 --> 00:58:26,175
Bring me the book!

662
00:58:31,944 --> 00:58:33,013
Scoob!

663
00:58:36,184 --> 00:58:37,458
Enough!

664
00:58:44,024 --> 00:58:45,013
Yikes!

665
00:59:04,384 --> 00:59:06,773
Here's the spell. lt's up to you, Thorn.

666
00:59:10,184 --> 00:59:13,813
The book is useless to a mere mortal.

667
00:59:15,024 --> 00:59:16,855
But not to a Wiccan.

668
00:59:17,464 --> 00:59:20,422
Nay! l'll stop thee myself!

669
00:59:21,864 --> 00:59:23,092
Hurry, Thorn! Read!

670
00:59:23,544 --> 00:59:25,739
''Ancient evil get thee hence

671
00:59:25,864 --> 00:59:29,334
''Only good can recompense
For the misdeeds that you've done

672
00:59:29,424 --> 00:59:31,858
''Witch, return from whence you've come! ''

673
00:59:45,704 --> 00:59:47,057
Thorn! lt's working!

674
01:00:03,544 --> 01:00:05,057
Not again!

675
01:00:15,384 --> 01:00:18,820
l won't go back alone!

676
01:00:37,304 --> 01:00:42,059
Ben Ravencroft's last book
is one the world will never buy.

677
01:00:42,344 --> 01:00:43,413
Thank goodness.

678
01:00:43,824 --> 01:00:46,736
lt would have been a hot best-seller.

679
01:00:53,024 --> 01:00:54,173
Daddy!

680
01:00:55,824 --> 01:00:58,782
-Are you okay?
-You're the one l was worried about.

681
01:00:59,144 --> 01:01:02,102
But you did it.
l guess you are a witch after all.

682
01:01:02,344 --> 01:01:04,619
A Wiccan, Daddy, a Wiccan.

683
01:01:08,544 --> 01:01:12,617
This is a disaster! No witch, no village.

684
01:01:12,744 --> 01:01:15,019
What are we gonna do
for our Autumn Fest?

685
01:01:15,704 --> 01:01:18,537
Well, you still have the Hex Girls.

686
01:01:19,984 --> 01:01:23,659
No offense, girls,
but l think we need a bigger attraction.

687
01:01:24,624 --> 01:01:26,262
