1
00:00:01,887 --> 00:00:03,240
I'm just trying to ask you out.

2
00:00:03,407 --> 00:00:05,716
I'm not trying to negotiate
a nuclear arms treaty.

3
00:00:08,327 --> 00:00:10,204
The citizens of Metropolis
have a right to ask.

4
00:00:10,927 --> 00:00:13,839
Our sophomore year
was really a breakout year for us.

5
00:00:15,887 --> 00:00:17,115
Breathe.

6
00:00:17,567 --> 00:00:20,877
The audience really wanted to see
Lois and Clark together.

7
00:00:23,407 --> 00:00:25,921
<i>I couldn't believe I was getting paid
to write Superman.</i>

8
00:00:28,247 --> 00:00:30,807
For us, the second season
was a whole new beginning.

9
00:00:41,407 --> 00:00:43,079
When I first did the show
I thought that...

10
00:00:44,407 --> 00:00:46,523
...this is going to be a smash hit
from the beginning.

11
00:00:46,687 --> 00:00:49,679
Then we started to air it,
and it wasn't a huge hit. It did okay.

12
00:00:49,847 --> 00:00:53,157
But season two was the one
where we hooked everybody, I believe.

13
00:00:53,327 --> 00:00:55,124
I think season one
got everybody interested.

14
00:00:55,287 --> 00:00:57,243
But season two hooked everybody in.

15
00:00:57,407 --> 00:01:00,922
That was our-- Our sophomore year
was really a breakout year for us...

16
00:01:01,087 --> 00:01:02,440
...as opposed to a sophomore slump.

17
00:01:02,607 --> 00:01:05,804
I saw your light.
Is this a bad time?

18
00:01:07,327 --> 00:01:08,601
It was probably the most...

19
00:01:10,207 --> 00:01:12,721
...I ever looked forward
to driving through a studio gate...

20
00:01:12,887 --> 00:01:16,243
...every morning,
was the summer of 1 994.

21
00:01:16,407 --> 00:01:19,160
Lois, come on.
You haven't said a word since 1 866.

22
00:01:19,327 --> 00:01:22,478
You are the lowest
form of life imaginable.

23
00:01:22,807 --> 00:01:26,766
We were told,
''Come up with great stories, have fun.

24
00:01:26,927 --> 00:01:29,395
But open up the world
somewhat to the idea...

25
00:01:29,567 --> 00:01:32,001
...that it's Lois, it's Clark,
and it's Superman. ''

26
00:01:32,207 --> 00:01:34,641
And those are to be thought of
in equal parts. ''

27
00:01:34,807 --> 00:01:38,117
The first season we were
just starting to build an audience.

28
00:01:38,287 --> 00:01:40,039
But the advantage of having
a second season...

29
00:01:41,407 --> 00:01:43,875
...is you see in the first season
what works and what doesn't...

30
00:01:44,047 --> 00:01:46,641
...script-wise and relationship-wise.
That's what you focus on.

31
00:01:46,807 --> 00:01:49,275
Maybe this is fate
giving us a second chance.

32
00:01:49,447 --> 00:01:51,961
Nice. You rehearse that one?

33
00:01:52,127 --> 00:01:53,924
Improvised on the spot.

34
00:01:54,087 --> 00:01:55,964
I approached it
like studying football film.

35
00:01:56,127 --> 00:02:00,962
I watched the shows and I said, ''That
works for the character, this doesn't. ''

36
00:02:01,127 --> 00:02:03,004
So I would try to modify things
based on that.

37
00:02:03,207 --> 00:02:05,721
It was a very natural role.
It was very fun.

38
00:02:05,887 --> 00:02:08,606
<i>I modeled my Superman character
after Christopher Reeves' character...</i>

39
00:02:08,807 --> 00:02:10,399
...and the way he played Superman.

40
00:02:10,567 --> 00:02:12,159
So that was simple,
that was Superman.

41
00:02:12,327 --> 00:02:16,206
But the Clark character was just
very well written and came naturally.

42
00:02:16,407 --> 00:02:21,401
-You are Superman.
-No. Lois, Superman is what I can do.

43
00:02:21,607 --> 00:02:23,438
Clark is who I am.

44
00:02:23,607 --> 00:02:26,405
My idea was that Superman
is a man of action.

45
00:02:26,687 --> 00:02:29,281
He comes in, whoosh, whoosh,
saves the bus, goes away.

46
00:02:29,487 --> 00:02:32,718
Let him go. And then let Clark
do all the rest of the stuff.

47
00:02:32,887 --> 00:02:37,085
Plus it was more comfortable to act
in a regular suit and tie and glasses...

48
00:02:37,287 --> 00:02:40,677
...as opposed to in the tights
and the whole nine yards.

49
00:02:42,367 --> 00:02:44,039
We started season two
with new cast members.

50
00:02:44,207 --> 00:02:46,004
And we lost Michael Landes.

51
00:02:46,167 --> 00:02:49,079
We brought in a whole new Jimmy
Olsen with a whole new attitude.

52
00:02:51,047 --> 00:02:53,607
You guys are not gonna believe
what just happened.

53
00:02:53,767 --> 00:02:55,166
Just the guy we were looking for.

54
00:02:55,327 --> 00:02:58,683
They were concentrating on different
areas, and we got a very talented...

55
00:02:58,847 --> 00:03:02,886
...very good actor, who's a really
good guy, Justin Whalin...

56
00:03:03,087 --> 00:03:07,478
...who stepped in and played Jimmy
Olsen in season two, three and four.

57
00:03:07,647 --> 00:03:10,480
Because I had just stopped doing
a series for Warner Bros...

58
00:03:10,687 --> 00:03:13,360
...between hearing about it,
auditioning the first time...

59
00:03:14,927 --> 00:03:18,966
...to getting the part was about three
or four days. So it happened very fast.

60
00:03:19,127 --> 00:03:22,563
Coming in and doing it this way,
you have a season already in the can...

61
00:03:22,847 --> 00:03:24,678
...that was fairly successful...

62
00:03:24,887 --> 00:03:28,880
...and the audience already has fallen in
love with the characters on the show.

63
00:03:29,087 --> 00:03:32,045
And I remember it took a while
for the fans to kind of warm up...

64
00:03:32,247 --> 00:03:34,283
...to the idea of me doing the part.

65
00:03:34,487 --> 00:03:37,285
Coming in and taking over a character
that's been established...

66
00:03:37,487 --> 00:03:42,356
...on a show that's been established,
it's a daunting thing to do for any actor.

67
00:03:42,527 --> 00:03:46,964
But Justin came in with a pedigree.
Justin had won an Emmy before.

68
00:03:47,127 --> 00:03:49,004
Your report on Schott.

69
00:03:50,167 --> 00:03:53,682
Got fired last year along with
his secretary. About a month ago...

70
00:03:53,847 --> 00:03:55,565
...a warehouse was rented in her name.

71
00:03:55,727 --> 00:03:58,560
If you ask any actor, exposition
is probably the toughest thing to do.

72
00:03:58,727 --> 00:04:03,164
Because it's-- You're trying
to give information in a useful way...

73
00:04:03,327 --> 00:04:05,557
...that is somehow still interesting.

74
00:04:05,847 --> 00:04:09,362
Teri and Dean
are really driving the story...

75
00:04:09,527 --> 00:04:11,995
...and Lane is basically
throwing orders around.

76
00:04:12,207 --> 00:04:14,038
Jimmy comes in
and gives the information...

77
00:04:14,207 --> 00:04:16,562
...that's necessary
to continue the story.

78
00:04:16,727 --> 00:04:19,366
It's easy to memorize stuff
that's about emotional interchange.

79
00:04:19,527 --> 00:04:22,200
But when you're trying to memorize
this street, that guy's name... .

80
00:04:22,367 --> 00:04:24,927
I did a lot of exposition.

81
00:04:25,087 --> 00:04:27,840
That was kind of my deal,
I was the exposition king.

82
00:04:28,007 --> 00:04:30,999
You have the same villain every week,
at some point...

83
00:04:31,167 --> 00:04:33,283
...your Superman
doesn't look too super.

84
00:04:33,447 --> 00:04:36,405
We got rid of Lex,
he was dead at the end of season one.

85
00:04:36,607 --> 00:04:38,598
Well, I love John Shea,
and he's a fantastic actor.

86
00:04:38,767 --> 00:04:40,564
Lois.

87
00:04:40,927 --> 00:04:44,715
When will you ever learn?
I always get my way.

88
00:04:44,887 --> 00:04:48,800
He was suave and debonair
and a good rival.

89
00:04:48,967 --> 00:04:53,119
Superman has a lot of
different villains...

90
00:04:53,287 --> 00:04:55,278
...to conquer and deal with.

91
00:04:55,447 --> 00:04:59,406
And we certainly came up
with a number of different, fun villains.

92
00:04:59,567 --> 00:05:02,639
It was great for us to have
a different enemy in each episode.

93
00:05:02,807 --> 00:05:06,925
When you're on a show and they bring in
a big name, they call it ''stunt casting. ''

94
00:05:07,087 --> 00:05:09,999
I think it helped kind of having
a fun guest star each week...

95
00:05:10,207 --> 00:05:12,641
...that was recognizable in other roles
who came to our show...

96
00:05:12,807 --> 00:05:15,401
...and entered Metropolis
and our little town.

97
00:05:15,607 --> 00:05:19,441
We had so many great actors
that came in who were recognizable.

98
00:05:19,607 --> 00:05:22,565
When Raquel Welch came in to play
that role, there was no one better...

99
00:05:22,727 --> 00:05:24,399
...for that role than her.

100
00:05:24,567 --> 00:05:26,205
I'd like to be alone with Superman.

101
00:05:26,407 --> 00:05:29,956
So it was really fun for us
to kind of create characters...

102
00:05:30,127 --> 00:05:33,199
...with these people in mind, and times
it would be the other way around.

103
00:05:33,367 --> 00:05:36,404
We'd create a character and we'd say,
who can we fit in this mold?

104
00:05:36,567 --> 00:05:39,718
As the show got more popular,
that, as it turned out, was a lot easier.

105
00:05:40,407 --> 00:05:43,001
As time went by,
you got bigger and bigger names.

106
00:05:43,207 --> 00:05:46,404
People who used to not take your
calls, or say they were unavailable...

107
00:05:46,607 --> 00:05:49,280
...were suddenly available.
And it was always great fun to see...

108
00:05:49,447 --> 00:05:51,722
...guys like Peter Boyle on the show,
or Bruce Campbell.

109
00:05:51,887 --> 00:05:54,003
I think those guys are good
and they're fun.

110
00:05:54,167 --> 00:05:55,725
l was a big fan of Superman
growing up.

111
00:05:57,367 --> 00:06:01,201
I think Dr. Gretchen Kelly really--
She was just a great opportunity...

112
00:06:01,447 --> 00:06:05,599
...to bring in this weird, sick humor.

113
00:06:05,767 --> 00:06:09,885
Playing baddies are always fun.
I mean, that's sort of a golden rule.

114
00:06:10,087 --> 00:06:15,366
You get to finally do all of the stuff
that you never get to do.

115
00:06:17,847 --> 00:06:20,839
The second season we tried
to heighten the production value...

116
00:06:21,007 --> 00:06:24,238
...and give it a more specific look.
It had a really glossy look.

117
00:06:24,887 --> 00:06:28,004
Kind of a comic-book look. And work
on things like the visual effects...

118
00:06:28,167 --> 00:06:30,886
...which came a long way
between season one and season two.

119
00:06:31,047 --> 00:06:34,437
Every year,
the more you did certain effects...

120
00:06:34,607 --> 00:06:37,804
...you certainly develop better
techniques, and that's a lot of fun.

121
00:06:37,967 --> 00:06:40,606
We went from an outside house
doing visual effects...

122
00:06:41,087 --> 00:06:43,647
...to guys that we had inside
working with us...

123
00:06:43,807 --> 00:06:47,686
...and took a lot more risk with the
visual effects and with special effects...

124
00:06:47,887 --> 00:06:50,924
...and tried to up that quite a bit
because it just looks so great.

125
00:06:51,087 --> 00:06:53,078
So we did a lot more
in the way of visual effects...

126
00:06:53,287 --> 00:06:57,565
...and in the way of integrating
that into the stories.

127
00:06:57,727 --> 00:06:59,877
It was really fun to see
how we'd improve year-to-year.

128
00:07:05,447 --> 00:07:08,484
One of the fun dynamics
in season two was the fact that...

129
00:07:08,647 --> 00:07:12,356
...Lois did not know that Clark was
Superman. And we played with that a lot.

130
00:07:12,687 --> 00:07:16,202
He'd be having a conversation and then,
''I forgot to do my laundry. '' Run off.

131
00:07:16,367 --> 00:07:18,676
Excuse me, I have to... .

132
00:07:19,007 --> 00:07:19,962
I have a dentist's appointment.

133
00:07:20,127 --> 00:07:21,845
I'm gonna call Jimmy.
I'm gonna get a hot dog.

134
00:07:22,007 --> 00:07:24,521
One of the things the writers
liked to write for Clark...

135
00:07:24,687 --> 00:07:27,645
...is him having to explain a way,
you know.

136
00:07:27,807 --> 00:07:29,399
''Where did you go?
What were you doing?''

137
00:07:29,567 --> 00:07:31,523
I'll be right back.
I forgot my mail downstairs.

138
00:07:31,687 --> 00:07:33,086
I have to return this video.

139
00:07:33,247 --> 00:07:34,885
It's really important.

140
00:07:35,127 --> 00:07:37,163
-I have to go.
-Where?

141
00:07:37,327 --> 00:07:39,761
-You guys stay here, it won't take long.
-What won't take long?

142
00:07:39,967 --> 00:07:44,518
The thing that I have to do in the place
that I'll be back from in just one second.

143
00:07:45,327 --> 00:07:47,318
Does he do that a lot?

144
00:07:47,487 --> 00:07:49,079
Constantly.

145
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:52,557
Often Clark would be stuck in a situation
where he couldn't go become Superman.

146
00:07:52,927 --> 00:07:56,476
He'd have to do something on the sly
and not get caught.

147
00:07:56,647 --> 00:07:58,603
And Lois wouldn't see it.

148
00:07:59,887 --> 00:08:02,606
I can't believe he ignored me like that.

149
00:08:06,487 --> 00:08:07,886
Made it nice and humorous.

150
00:08:08,047 --> 00:08:11,483
He'd use some super power, whether
it's super breath or his laser vision...

151
00:08:11,647 --> 00:08:14,957
...or whatever it happened to be,
to sort of solve the problem.

152
00:08:15,567 --> 00:08:18,445
-I'm good.
-Yes, you are.

153
00:08:18,927 --> 00:08:22,602
The biggest thing that came between year
one and two was the number of letters...

154
00:08:22,767 --> 00:08:25,042
...we got from people that wanted
to get the two together.

155
00:08:25,207 --> 00:08:28,324
It was always something that we fought,
but the audience really wanted...

156
00:08:28,487 --> 00:08:30,239
...to see Lois and Clark together.

157
00:08:30,967 --> 00:08:34,277
They were trying to bring us together,
they're gonna start to get together...

158
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:37,917
...they're gonna get together, and then
someone would come in between.

159
00:08:38,087 --> 00:08:39,964
What would you say
if I asked you out sometime?

160
00:08:40,127 --> 00:08:41,196
Are you asking me out?

161
00:08:41,767 --> 00:08:44,281
Either someone for her
or someone for my character.

162
00:08:44,527 --> 00:08:46,961
It makes it a lot of fun,
playing a jealousy thing.

163
00:08:48,407 --> 00:08:49,396
Hi.

164
00:08:49,567 --> 00:08:52,286
We wanted to make it feel like
they were getting closer and closer...

165
00:08:52,447 --> 00:08:54,119
...and then pull them apart fast.

166
00:08:54,607 --> 00:08:57,644
Every episode was a dance with them.
And that's what made it so fun.

167
00:08:58,007 --> 00:08:59,998
You had these two people
who were so much in love...

168
00:09:00,167 --> 00:09:03,364
...and the audience is going, ''Yeah, get
them together. They should be together. ''

169
00:09:03,527 --> 00:09:05,995
But if you bring them together,
all the heat's gone.

170
00:09:06,407 --> 00:09:08,523
It was great, the tension
between the two characters...

171
00:09:08,687 --> 00:09:12,396
...trying to get them together.
And letting them just finally date...

172
00:09:12,567 --> 00:09:15,843
...and fall in love. They've been falling
in love since the moment they met...

173
00:09:16,007 --> 00:09:17,520
...but they didn't even realize it.

174
00:09:17,687 --> 00:09:19,962
<i>When I really felt
like Lois & Clark was really working...</i>

175
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:21,879
...was when the tension
was excruciating.

176
00:09:22,847 --> 00:09:26,362
When it was like, ''Come on!

177
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:29,837
You've got to be kidding me! Kiss him!

178
00:09:30,047 --> 00:09:32,197
He loves you! ''
Or, ''Tell her the truth! ''

179
00:09:32,367 --> 00:09:36,440
And then to not deliver on that,
I think, accentuated the tension...

180
00:09:36,607 --> 00:09:38,643
...and that's what makes
a good romantic story.

181
00:09:38,847 --> 00:09:42,203
In the second season you really
hone in on what you see is working.

182
00:09:42,407 --> 00:09:45,444
The characters have a voice and there's
so much to do the second season...

183
00:09:45,607 --> 00:09:48,963
...because it's already been tested
and it's already kind of been proven.

184
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:52,365
<i>I think Lois & Clark
really, really, was clicking.</i>

185
00:09:52,527 --> 00:09:55,917
Writing season two was just,
it was great. It was so fun.

186
00:09:56,247 --> 00:09:57,919
Smoking.

187
00:09:59,167 --> 00:10:02,523
It was a wonderful season. It was a
season, again, where we hit our stride...

188
00:10:02,687 --> 00:10:06,521
...and found a real nice niche
in television.

189
00:10:06,687 --> 00:10:09,360
And people really started tuning in.
