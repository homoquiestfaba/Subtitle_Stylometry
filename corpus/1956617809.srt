1
00:00:01,268 --> 00:00:03,020
- Hi, it's me Ginger.

2
00:00:03,353 --> 00:00:06,356
Now I understand that
in Vice Academy part two

3
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:09,026
you want more sexuality
than you did in part one.

4
00:00:09,359 --> 00:00:12,112
(upbeat rock music)

5
00:00:17,492 --> 00:00:20,704
Which of course I
have no problem with.

6
00:00:32,382 --> 00:00:33,717
- New in town?

7
00:00:34,051 --> 00:00:34,801
- You could say that.

8
00:00:36,011 --> 00:00:38,138
So you had much luck so far?

9
00:00:38,472 --> 00:00:39,097
- I've seen better.

10
00:00:40,849 --> 00:00:41,600
- So what's your price?

11
00:00:43,894 --> 00:00:45,812
- 50 bucks, if it's
any of your business.

12
00:00:47,731 --> 00:00:48,565
- You know any
other good corners

13
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:50,776
around here for girls like us?

14
00:00:51,109 --> 00:00:52,444
- You know you ask
a lot of questions.

15
00:00:52,778 --> 00:00:53,362
What's your story?

16
00:00:54,821 --> 00:00:56,490
- Nothing, I'm just a girl
trying to pay her rent.

17
00:00:56,823 --> 00:00:57,574
You should be able
to understand that.

18
00:00:57,908 --> 00:00:59,493
I mean we are all
sisters in this.

19
00:01:00,869 --> 00:01:01,953
- [Dispatcher] Come
in, any officers

20
00:01:02,287 --> 00:01:03,622
in the vicinity to
Honk and Whore Park.

21
00:01:03,955 --> 00:01:06,667
Backups are needed to
apprehend a suspect on foot.

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,586
Come in any officers in the
vicinity to Honk and Whore Park.

23
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,713
Backups are needed to
apprehend a suspect on foot.

24
00:01:12,047 --> 00:01:13,465
- What the hell is that?

25
00:01:15,926 --> 00:01:18,095
- What, I didn't hear anything.

26
00:01:18,428 --> 00:01:20,013
- [Dispatcher] Come
in, do you read me?

27
00:01:21,515 --> 00:01:23,058
- Well it's coming
from your purse.

28
00:01:25,811 --> 00:01:27,729
- This is Holly,
I'll be right there.

29
00:01:28,939 --> 00:01:29,815
- You set me up.

30
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:43,495
You know, I thought
you were a sister.

31
00:01:44,913 --> 00:01:47,457
- Honey I'm not
even your cousin.

32
00:01:49,918 --> 00:01:52,254
(upbeat music)

33
00:01:58,093 --> 00:02:01,304
- I been waiting for this
massage for a long time, baby.

34
00:02:01,638 --> 00:02:02,597
(chuckles)

35
00:02:02,931 --> 00:02:04,725
- And I'm sure you'll remember
it for a long time too.

36
00:02:07,436 --> 00:02:08,520
(liquid squirting)

37
00:02:08,854 --> 00:02:11,773
(man groaning)

38
00:02:12,107 --> 00:02:12,649
- Ooh.

39
00:02:23,285 --> 00:02:24,161
- Feel good?

40
00:02:25,787 --> 00:02:30,500
- Yeah, hey let's say I
just roll over onto my back

41
00:02:31,835 --> 00:02:32,043
here and we get
down to business.

42
00:02:32,377 --> 00:02:33,545
(laughs)

43
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:35,338
I paid double at
the door, darling.

44
00:02:36,715 --> 00:02:39,092
- [Dispatcher] Come
in, do you read me?

45
00:02:39,426 --> 00:02:41,636
Officers in the vicinity to
Honk and Whore Park come in.

46
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:43,555
- What the hell is that?

47
00:02:43,889 --> 00:02:46,767
(handcuffs jingling)

48
00:02:51,646 --> 00:02:52,689
- I don't have time to
explain, just read yourself

49
00:02:53,023 --> 00:02:55,525
the bill of rights
until I get back.

50
00:02:56,693 --> 00:02:57,486
- Cop, huh?

51
00:02:59,196 --> 00:03:01,698
Well what the hell, if
you're gonna bust me anyway,

52
00:03:02,032 --> 00:03:04,534
what's say with go on
ahead and get naked.

53
00:03:04,868 --> 00:03:05,327
(laughs)

54
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:06,870
What do you think?

55
00:03:07,204 --> 00:03:09,289
- Well you are kind of
cute but I don't have time.

56
00:03:10,373 --> 00:03:11,792
What's your name?

57
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:12,751
- John, John Riggers.

58
00:03:15,003 --> 00:03:16,713
My friends, my lady
friends, you know

59
00:03:17,047 --> 00:03:18,089
they just call me Long John.

60
00:03:18,423 --> 00:03:19,424
(chuckles)

61
00:03:19,758 --> 00:03:21,426
- I'm Didi, ask for my
number at the station

62
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,012
and call me after
you post bail, okay?

63
00:03:27,349 --> 00:03:28,058
- Didi and hey,

64
00:03:31,603 --> 00:03:32,854
just be careful out there.

65
00:03:39,277 --> 00:03:40,445
(dramatic music)

66
00:03:40,779 --> 00:03:45,534
(sirens blaring)
(gun firing)

67
00:03:56,711 --> 00:03:57,462
- Hey were are you going?

68
00:03:57,796 --> 00:03:59,130
- Vice, am I the first one here?

69
00:03:59,464 --> 00:04:00,131
- It looks like it, he's inside.

70
00:04:00,465 --> 00:04:00,966
- Okey.

71
00:04:09,391 --> 00:04:10,141
- Vice cop.

72
00:04:10,475 --> 00:04:11,017
- Go right in.

73
00:04:19,734 --> 00:04:21,987
(cat meowing)

74
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:03,778
- [Both] Freeze!

75
00:05:04,112 --> 00:05:05,780
- Didi, what are you doing here?

76
00:05:06,114 --> 00:05:08,116
- I received an
urgent police call.

77
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:10,201
- Yeah, well I can handle
this one by myself.

78
00:05:10,535 --> 00:05:12,954
Why don't you go back to
your other so called case?

79
00:05:13,288 --> 00:05:14,289
- No, why don't you?

80
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:16,791
- You know you're really
making a fool out of yourself.

81
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:19,002
Everyone knows the
only reason the academy

82
00:05:19,336 --> 00:05:21,338
let you graduate is
because out of pity.

83
00:05:21,671 --> 00:05:22,505
- Out of what!

84
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:23,381
- You heard me.

85
00:05:24,341 --> 00:05:26,885
(cop shushing the ladies)

86
00:05:27,218 --> 00:05:27,969
- What is that?

87
00:05:28,303 --> 00:05:29,679
- Would you two keep it down?

88
00:05:30,013 --> 00:05:31,097
- Oh great, another one.

89
00:05:33,183 --> 00:05:34,142

90
00:05:34,476 --> 00:05:36,937
(dramatic music)

91
00:05:38,313 --> 00:05:39,898
- Stay clear, just let
me get a shot at him.

92
00:05:40,231 --> 00:05:41,733
- No way, this is my arrest.

93
00:05:42,067 --> 00:05:42,651
- Says you.

94
00:05:42,984 --> 00:05:43,860

124
00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:35,055
which one of you got
in the way first?

125
00:07:36,264 --> 00:07:37,098
- It was her fault.

126
00:07:37,432 --> 00:07:39,017
- The hell it was.

127
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:40,935
- It was both their faults.

128
00:07:41,269 --> 00:07:43,938
I've never seen such
unprofessional ethics before.

129
00:07:44,272 --> 00:07:47,067
- Calm down now, it's
their first assignment

130
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,027
since they graduated
from the academy.

131
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,528
They're still new at this.

132
00:07:50,862 --> 00:07:52,155
- Mm-hmm.

133
00:07:52,489 --> 00:07:54,115
- And you wouldn't want to
make me look bad would you?

134
00:07:54,449 --> 00:07:55,492
- Oh no, no, no, of
course not Ms. Devonshire.

135
00:07:55,825 --> 00:07:58,953
There's always a place for
your girls on the force.

136
00:07:59,287 --> 00:08:00,872
The question is, we
need to find something

137
00:08:01,206 --> 00:08:02,624
a little more suited
for their talents.

138
00:08:02,957 --> 00:08:04,042
- Thank you, sir.

139
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:06,711
- We were so close, you know
I could have had a clear

140
00:08:07,045 --> 00:08:09,089

wasn't for these two.

141
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:11,132
- [Both] Please.

142
00:08:11,466 --> 00:08:13,176
- And they injured me too.

143
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:15,762
You know it's a good thing I
didn't file for workman's comp.

144
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,225
- You're right, you better
see a specialist about that.

145
00:08:21,893 --> 00:08:22,769
- That I Will, sir.

146
00:08:24,395 --> 00:08:25,188
Excuse me.

147
00:08:25,522 --> 00:08:26,523
- Mm-hmm.

148
00:08:26,856 --> 00:08:29,901
Ms. Devonshire, I want
you to go into my office.

149
00:08:30,235 --> 00:08:32,862
There's a file on my desk,
it will have the starting

150
00:08:33,196 --> 00:08:34,823
positions for your girls here.

151
00:08:35,156 --> 00:08:36,199
You can brief 'em on it and then

152
00:08:36,533 --> 00:08:38,785
I'll see you later on at
the introductory meeting.

153
00:08:39,994 --> 00:08:41,162
Good day.

154
00:08:41,496 --> 00:08:42,080
- Good day, sir.

155
00:08:42,413 --> 00:08:43,456
- Bye.

158
00:08:52,924 --> 00:08:54,092
- [Trucker] 32, 32.

159
00:08:54,425 --> 00:08:56,469
- Breaker one nine for
that Big Daddy Trucker.

160
00:08:56,803 --> 00:08:57,804
You out there?

161
00:08:58,138 --> 00:09:00,014
- [Trucker] Is that
you little Jeannie?

162
00:09:00,348 --> 00:09:01,224
- The one and only.

163
00:09:01,558 --> 00:09:03,393
Now listen real
closely, I'll be faking

164
00:09:03,726 --> 00:09:05,979

(moaning)

166
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:17,073
- [Trucker On Radio] 22, 34.

167
00:09:17,407 --> 00:09:18,199
- That's a big 10-4.

168
00:09:21,077 --> 00:09:22,912
Petrolino, what
can I do for you?

169
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:27,167
- Well I had a little
accident on the job

170
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:32,297
and I was wondering if
you'd help me work it out.

171
00:09:33,423 --> 00:09:35,466
- For you, anything.

172
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,261
(romantic music)

173
00:09:42,473 --> 00:09:43,766
(Jeannie giggling)

174
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,019
(Petrolino sighing)

175
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:46,978
(Jeannie purring)

176
00:09:47,312 --> 00:09:47,854
- Ooh.

177
00:09:49,397 --> 00:09:50,857
- How does that feel?

178
00:09:51,191 --> 00:09:52,233
- That's a start.

179
00:10:01,409 --> 00:10:03,620
- Thank you girls, in your
first five minutes here

180
00:10:03,953 --> 00:10:06,372
you've already managed to
humiliate me completely.

181
00:10:07,665 --> 00:10:09,292
- We've been here more
than five minutes.

182
00:10:09,626 --> 00:10:11,377
- Shut up, your
positions on the force

183
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:15,006
have already been decided
for you so get used to them.

184
00:10:18,801 --> 00:10:22,347
You will be working
together as a team.

185
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:25,183
- What, that's impossible.

186
00:10:25,516 --> 00:10:27,518
- I am not working with her.

187
00:10:27,852 --> 00:10:30,188
- There is one other
assignment available

188
00:10:30,521 --> 00:10:33,233
if you decide not to
work together as a team.

189
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:34,484
- [Both] I'll take it.

190
00:10:34,817 --> 00:10:37,278
- It involves detailed
undercover work.

191
00:10:37,612 --> 00:10:38,488
- [Both] I'll do it.

192
00:10:38,821 --> 00:10:40,823
- Extensive research.

193
00:10:41,157 --> 00:10:42,200
<i>- [Both] I want it.</i>

194
00:10:42,533 --> 00:10:46,454
- The assignment is going
undercover as a prison inmate.

195
00:10:46,788 --> 00:10:47,789
- [Both] She can have it.

196
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,501
- Wait a minute, my
father would never

197
00:10:51,834 --> 00:10:53,878
let me go undercover
in a prison.

198
00:10:54,212 --> 00:10:55,922
- Is that so?

199
00:10:56,256 --> 00:10:58,800
- Whew, that's a
lot off my mind.

200
00:10:59,133 --> 00:11:00,093
When your father's the chief

201
00:11:00,426 --> 00:11:02,178
of police it does
have it's advantages.

202
00:11:02,512 --> 00:11:04,472
So Didi I hope that
second assignment

203
00:11:04,806 --> 00:11:06,015
won't be a problem for you.

204
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:08,685
- That's not fair.

205
00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:12,313
- Well Holly, as
a matter of fact,

206
00:11:12,647 --> 00:11:15,233
your father left me a note
concerning your career.

207
00:11:15,566 --> 00:11:17,235
Would you like me to read it?

208
00:11:17,568 --> 00:11:18,361
- Go right ahead.

209
00:11:22,573 --> 00:11:25,201
- Dear Ms. Devonshire,
now that my daughter

210
00:11:25,535 --> 00:11:29,372
is working on the force,
she is on her own.

211
00:11:29,706 --> 00:11:33,251
No more special treatment
from me, you go right ahead

212
00:11:33,584 --> 00:11:36,337
and give her any
assignment that seems fit.

213
00:11:36,671 --> 00:11:41,384
I stand behind your
decisions 100%.

214
00:11:43,261 --> 00:11:46,180
- You want to tell me about
some of those advantages?

215
00:11:46,514 --> 00:11:47,265
- Shut up, Didi.

216
00:11:49,392 --> 00:11:51,519
- Well what'll be, girls?

217
00:11:51,853 --> 00:11:54,689
Teamwork or prison duty?

218
00:11:56,566 --> 00:11:57,358
- Teamwork.

219
00:11:57,692 --> 00:11:58,443
- Teamwork.

220
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:02,572
- What's that, I can't hear you?

221
00:12:02,905 --> 00:12:04,198
- [Both] Teamwork.

222
00:12:05,575 --> 00:12:10,079
- Very good, and remember,
if either of you fail

223
00:12:10,413 --> 00:12:12,874
at working as a team,
you will automatically

224
00:12:13,207 --> 00:12:16,419
be given the second
assignment, got that?

225
00:12:16,753 --> 00:12:18,087
- Yeah.
- Yes.

226
00:12:18,421 --> 00:12:21,966
- Now follow me, I'll show you
where you'll be working here.

227
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:27,055
(bell ringing)
(upbeat music)

228
00:12:28,389 --> 00:12:30,183
- Excuse me, where's
your water cooler?

229
00:12:30,516 --> 00:12:32,352
- Right down that hall.

230
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:33,686
- Thank you very much, madame.

231
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:34,896
- My pleasure.

232
00:12:37,565 --> 00:12:40,610
- Give us a clue, what kind
of work are we going to get?

233
00:12:40,943 --> 00:12:43,321
Riding around in a patrol car?

234
00:12:43,654 --> 00:12:45,239
- Maybe a supervisory position

235
00:12:45,573 --> 00:12:47,325
with others working below us.

236
00:12:47,658 --> 00:12:51,371
- No something a
little more suitable.

237
00:12:52,663 --> 00:12:55,124
(jazzy music)

238
00:12:58,378 --> 00:12:58,961
(Jeannie yelling)

239
00:12:59,295 --> 00:12:59,754
- Whoops.

240
00:13:00,088 --> 00:13:02,256
(both laughing)

241
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:04,384
- That's not the first
time that's ever happened.

242
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:06,386
- Now you realize that resisting

243
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:09,430
an officer is a
criminal offense.

244
00:13:09,764 --> 00:13:11,140
- Don't I know it.

245
00:13:18,648 --> 00:13:21,317
(both giggling)

246
00:13:21,651 --> 00:13:22,652
(Ms. Devonshire clearing throat)

247
00:13:22,985 --> 00:13:24,862
- Well thank you very
much for that information.

248
00:13:25,196 --> 00:13:25,988
- Sure no problem.

249
00:13:27,782 --> 00:13:30,451
(clearing throat)

250
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:32,745
Excuse me.

251
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:40,461
- Jeannie, this
is Didi and Holly.

252
00:13:40,795 --> 00:13:43,423
They'll be assisting you
with the switchboard.

253
00:13:43,756 --> 00:13:44,715
- Hi, nice to meet ya.

254
00:13:46,801 --> 00:13:50,304
- The switchboard, you
gotta be kidding me?

255
00:13:50,638 --> 00:13:54,016
- The switchboard,
any problem with that?

256
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:54,809
- No.

257
00:13:55,143 --> 00:13:56,394
- No.

258
00:13:56,727 --> 00:13:59,397
- Good, I'll be back later
after you three get acquainted.

259
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:01,941
I'll be working on my speech.

260
00:14:02,275 --> 00:14:05,153
Commissioner and fellow
officers of the law,

261
00:14:05,486 --> 00:14:09,532
may I present the two graduates
who have made my life hell.

262
00:14:09,866 --> 00:14:10,867
No wait, that's not it.

263
00:14:15,329 --> 00:14:16,789
- So Jeannie, I
guess you're gonna

264
00:14:17,123 --> 00:14:19,709
show us how the
switchboard works.

265
00:14:20,042 --> 00:14:20,585
- Huh?

266
00:14:21,836 --> 00:14:24,338
Oh yeah, sure.

267
00:14:24,672 --> 00:14:27,508
See police calls come in on
this station and I dispatch

268
00:14:27,842 --> 00:14:30,470
officers out to wherever
they're calling from.

269
00:14:30,803 --> 00:14:31,471
- I see.

270
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:33,556
(loud buzzing)

271
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:34,474
- [Woman] Help me,

272
00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:36,559
there's a man outside my window.

273
00:14:36,893 --> 00:14:38,394
- Well if he's cute
get his number for me.

274
00:14:38,728 --> 00:14:41,105
That gets boring really fast.

275
00:14:41,439 --> 00:14:42,648
If you really want
to have some fun,

276
00:14:42,982 --> 00:14:45,318
here's a frequency that
all the truckers use.

277
00:14:46,694 --> 00:14:48,529
- What about that woman?

278
00:14:48,863 --> 00:14:50,156
(static hissing)

279
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:51,574
- If it's important
she'll call back.

280
00:14:51,908 --> 00:14:53,451
- [Trucker On Radio] 15, 39, 15.

281
00:14:53,784 --> 00:14:56,078
- [Trucker On Radio] Little
Jeannie, you still out there?

282
00:14:56,412 --> 00:14:58,539
This is Daddy Trucker calling.

283
00:14:58,873 --> 00:14:59,832
- That's for me.

284
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:01,417
This is little Jeannie again.

285
00:15:01,751 --> 00:15:03,836
I've got two new friends with
me, you want to meet them?

286
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:07,507
- [Trucker] Honey does a
bear shit in the woods?

287
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:08,591
(Jeannie giggling)

288
00:15:08,925 --> 00:15:10,426
- Jeannie, what about
the police call?

289
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:13,513
- Shh, I want to introduce you.

290
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:15,223
I get a lot of dates this way.

291
00:15:17,099 --> 00:15:18,476
Now think of two
handles that you

292
00:15:18,809 --> 00:15:19,977
guys can use for for your name.

293
00:15:20,937 --> 00:15:22,313
- Like what?

294
00:15:22,647 --> 00:15:24,273
- [Trucker] Hey, what
happened to your friends?

295
00:15:24,607 --> 00:15:25,858
- Oh they're still here.

296
00:15:26,192 --> 00:15:30,947
I want you to meet
Begging For More

297
00:15:31,906 --> 00:15:34,742
and Getting It All Night Long.

298
00:15:35,076 --> 00:15:36,077
- That's disgusting.

299
00:15:37,078 --> 00:15:38,329
- Well come on, say hello.

300
00:15:41,707 --> 00:15:42,416
- Hello.

301
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,502
- [Trucker] Which one are you?

302
00:15:44,835 --> 00:15:45,503
- Begging For More.

303
00:15:45,836 --> 00:15:46,629
- [Trucker] Ooh-wee.

304
00:15:47,797 --> 00:15:49,006
- Come on, it's your turn.

305
00:15:51,217 --> 00:15:51,926
- No thank you.

306
00:15:53,135 --> 00:15:55,513
- [Trucker] What
happened to your friend?

307
00:15:55,846 --> 00:15:57,306
- She's a little shy.

308
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,642
- [Trucker] Sounds
like just my type.

309
00:15:59,976 --> 00:16:01,060
- I don't think so.

310
00:16:01,394 --> 00:16:02,645
(alarm buzzing)

311
00:16:02,979 --> 00:16:04,438
- What's that?

312
00:16:04,772 --> 00:16:06,065
(alarm buzzing)

313
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,900
- Oh it's a police
call coming in.

314
00:16:08,234 --> 00:16:09,527
I better switch back.

315
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:12,655
You still out there,
Big Daddy Trucker?

316
00:16:12,989 --> 00:16:13,698
Now don't forget to make a pit

317
00:16:14,031 --> 00:16:16,367
stop next time you're in
town, I'll be waiting.

318
00:16:16,701 --> 00:16:17,702
- [Trucker] Maybe I'll
bring some of my buddies

319
00:16:18,035 --> 00:16:21,163
along for your friends
and we can party.

320
00:16:21,497 --> 00:16:23,583
- Sounds good to me, also
don't forget to bring--

321
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:26,085
- Jeannie, the police call.

322
00:16:26,419 --> 00:16:26,877
- [Jeannie] Oh.

323
00:16:27,211 --> 00:16:27,753
- [Trucker] 10-4.

324
00:16:29,797 --> 00:16:32,049
- Police station,
how may I serve you?

325
00:16:32,383 --> 00:16:34,594
- [Lady On Phone] Yes, please
don't put me on hold again.

326
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:36,929
There's shooting going on,
out in front of where I live.

327
00:16:37,263 --> 00:16:38,598
Please send an officer out.

328
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:41,517
- Ma'am, are you sure it's
just not a car backfiring?

329
00:16:41,851 --> 00:16:42,518
- [Lady On Phone]
I'm pretty sure.

330
00:16:42,852 --> 00:16:44,478
All of my front windows
have been blown out.

331
00:16:44,812 --> 00:16:47,148
Can you please send
someone out now?

332
00:16:47,481 --> 00:16:48,941
- Okay, all right, all right.

333
00:16:49,275 --> 00:16:50,276
Tell me where you live.

334
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:51,193
- [Lady On Phone]
I'm at the corner

335
00:16:51,527 --> 00:16:52,737
of Cowanga and Lancerscot.

336
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:56,699
- Okay, if I send someone
out, will you promise

337
00:16:57,033 --> 00:16:58,576
not to call me back, how's that?

338
00:16:58,909 --> 00:17:00,077
- [Lady On Phone]
Oh yes, thank you.

339
00:17:00,411 --> 00:17:01,704
- Oh hold on a minute.

340
00:17:03,956 --> 00:17:08,836
(upbeat music)
(all chattering)

341
00:17:13,924 --> 00:17:17,678
- So, after she finishes taking
care of me and my friends.

342
00:17:18,012 --> 00:17:20,431
She says, "I'm getting tired."

343
00:17:20,765 --> 00:17:22,350
I didn't care, I
passed her around

344
00:17:22,683 --> 00:17:24,226
the room like a dirty magazine.

345
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,019
You know what I'm saying?

346
00:17:25,353 --> 00:17:25,811
(officers laughing)

347
00:17:26,145 --> 00:17:27,438
- [Officer] Oh my.

348
00:17:27,772 --> 00:17:32,401
- Anyway, Jeannie, we were
just talking about you.

349
00:17:33,903 --> 00:17:36,739
- Really, well I hope
it was something nice.

350
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,576
Oh I got a call for you,
Cowanga and Lancerscon,

351
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:43,454
some woman thinks there's
shooting going on.

352
00:17:43,788 --> 00:17:44,789
Why don't you go check it out?

353
00:17:45,122 --> 00:17:46,374
- Sure thing.

354
00:17:46,707 --> 00:17:49,168
Hey, don't forget our
date later tonight right.

355
00:17:49,502 --> 00:17:51,712
- How could I, Big Night Stick?

356
00:17:53,047 --> 00:17:56,592
(officers laughing)

357
00:17:56,926 --> 00:17:57,468
Excuse me.

358
00:18:02,223 --> 00:18:05,351
- Jeannie, how well
do you know Petrolino?

359
00:18:05,685 --> 00:18:07,395
- How well do I know him?

360
00:18:07,728 --> 00:18:08,396
Honey, he's the one that makes

361
00:18:08,729 --> 00:18:10,398
all the promotions around here.

362
00:18:10,731 --> 00:18:11,732
- You're joking, right?

363
00:18:12,066 --> 00:18:13,818
- Yeah, you're not serious.

364
00:18:14,151 --> 00:18:15,111
- Dead serious.

365
00:18:15,444 --> 00:18:16,195
Honey, if you ever
expect to move

366
00:18:16,529 --> 00:18:17,780
up the ladder in this place,

367
00:18:18,114 --> 00:18:20,116
that's the hiney you
better start kissing up to.

368
00:18:21,575 --> 00:18:22,410
- Goodbye, Jeannie.

369
00:18:23,536 --> 00:18:24,245
- Bye.

370
00:18:24,578 --> 00:18:27,123
(seductive music)

371
00:18:32,086 --> 00:18:32,795
(phone ringing)

372
00:18:33,129 --> 00:18:34,296
Oh, would you get that for me?

373
00:18:36,924 --> 00:18:39,885
- Hello, it's a free clinic?

374
00:18:41,137 --> 00:18:43,222
No, I think you have
the wrong number.

375
00:18:43,556 --> 00:18:46,308
There's nobody here
named Bambi Jo Creamshe.

376
00:18:46,642 --> 00:18:48,853
- Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, that's
for me, that's for me.

377
00:18:50,938 --> 00:18:52,732
It's just a little
name I use down there.

378
00:18:54,108 --> 00:18:55,192
Yes, speaking.

379
00:18:56,736 --> 00:18:58,320
It's today, really?

380
00:18:59,447 --> 00:19:00,531
Well I'll be right down.

381
00:19:01,866 --> 00:19:03,617
I've got to run,
the two of you can

382
00:19:03,951 --> 00:19:05,828
handle things around
here, can't you?

383
00:19:06,162 --> 00:19:07,037
- Well I don't know.

384
00:19:07,371 --> 00:19:09,832
- Well good, it puts
my mind at ease.

385
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:11,417
Oh by the way, the
clinics running

386
00:19:11,751 --> 00:19:12,710
a two for one special today.

387
00:19:13,043 --> 00:19:14,503
Either one of you
want to join me?

388
00:19:14,837 --> 00:19:15,963
It'd be my treat.

389
00:19:16,297 --> 00:19:16,839
- Thanks anyway.

390
00:19:19,049 --> 00:19:19,842
- No, okay.

391
00:19:20,176 --> 00:19:22,928
(light synth music)

392
00:19:25,723 --> 00:19:26,390
Bye now.

393
00:19:29,852 --> 00:19:32,438
(dramatic music)

394
00:20:00,382 --> 00:20:02,802
(gun firing)

395
00:20:09,058 --> 00:20:09,975
- Shit.

396
00:20:11,894 --> 00:20:12,686
Come in, do you read me?

397
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:13,854
(gun firing)

398
00:20:14,188 --> 00:20:14,688
Come in.

399
00:20:15,022 --> 00:20:15,856
(alarm buzzing)

400
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:16,607
- Listen, a call's coming in.

401
00:20:16,941 --> 00:20:18,818
- Hey, do you read me?

402
00:20:19,151 --> 00:20:21,320
This is Big Night
Stick, do you read me?

403
00:20:22,988 --> 00:20:25,449
- Big Night Stick, it sounds
like one of Jeannie's friends.

404
00:20:25,783 --> 00:20:27,660
Don't real police calls
ever come in here?

405
00:20:27,993 --> 00:20:29,453
- I'm gonna talk to him.

406
00:20:29,787 --> 00:20:30,830
- That figures.

407
00:20:31,163 --> 00:20:32,873
- We hear ya, Big Night Stick.

408
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:35,417
- Jeannie, is that you?

409
00:20:35,751 --> 00:20:37,002
Listen I'm in my car right now.

410
00:20:37,336 --> 00:20:40,840
I've just been met by an unexpected
visitor, I need backups.

411
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:42,216
- Yeah right.

412
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:45,511
- This isn't Jeannie,
this is Begging For More.

413
00:20:46,887 --> 00:20:48,597
- Whoever this is,
I need backups.

414
00:20:48,931 --> 00:20:49,974
(gun firing)

415
00:20:50,307 --> 00:20:51,851
- What is that, I can't hear
him over all that noise.

416
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:54,478
- I don't know, I think he
said he needs a backrub.

417
00:20:54,812 --> 00:20:55,938
- Why don't you talk to him?

418
00:20:56,272 --> 00:20:57,398
- No.

419
00:20:57,731 --> 00:20:59,859
- Go on, have a little fun.

420
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:03,821
Big Night Stick, here's my friend
Getting It All Night Long.

421
00:21:05,406 --> 00:21:06,615
- Can you hear me?

422
00:21:06,949 --> 00:21:08,158
I don't know how much
longer I can hold out.

423
00:21:08,492 --> 00:21:09,827
(gun firing)

424
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,371
- Sounds like a party, go on
and flirt with him a little.

425
00:21:12,705 --> 00:21:13,622
- I'd rather not.

426
00:21:13,956 --> 00:21:14,957
- Well if you think
you can't do it.

427
00:21:18,335 --> 00:21:22,381
- Hey Big Night Stick, this
is Getting It All Night Long.

428
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:26,969
Why don't you hold out and
save it for me big boy.

429
00:21:27,303 --> 00:21:29,930
(dramatic music)

430
00:21:30,264 --> 00:21:30,848
(officer groaning)
(loud smacking)

431
00:21:31,181 --> 00:21:32,600
- [Criminal] Here's your backup.

432
00:21:32,933 --> 00:21:34,977
- Big Night Stick,
where's your party at?

433
00:21:35,311 --> 00:21:37,438
Give me the scoop and
we'll join your group.

434
00:21:37,771 --> 00:21:38,731
(officer groaning)

435
00:21:39,064 --> 00:21:40,024
Treat me right and we
can party all night.

436
00:21:40,357 --> 00:21:43,819
Let's drink a little potion
and start a commotion.

437
00:21:44,153 --> 00:21:44,778
(giggles)

438
00:21:45,112 --> 00:21:46,906
- You're pretty good at this.

439
00:21:47,239 --> 00:21:47,948
- It's just like my old job.

440
00:21:48,282 --> 00:21:49,617
- Yeah, what you do before?

441
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:50,701
- Phone sex.

442
00:21:52,494 --> 00:21:57,333
Hey everybody out there within
a 30 mile radius, listen up.

443
00:21:59,043 --> 00:22:00,753
This is Begging For More,
there's a party at my place

444
00:22:01,086 --> 00:22:04,798
at 625 Clinton Way, if I'm
not home when you get there,

445
00:22:05,132 --> 00:22:06,717
the keys right under the mat.

446
00:22:08,177 --> 00:22:10,804
- How did a bunch of hookers
get ahold to our frequency?

447
00:22:11,138 --> 00:22:12,348
- I don't know, sir.

448
00:22:14,391 --> 00:22:17,269
(suspenseful music)

449
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:25,069
- Well you, Pet.

450
00:22:30,491 --> 00:22:31,200
(dramatic music)

451
00:22:31,533 --> 00:22:33,535
Petrolino, what happened?

452
00:22:33,869 --> 00:22:35,955
- Who was working the
switchboard today?

453
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:38,207
- I think Jeannie is.

454
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:41,835
- No it's not, whoever it
is almost got me killed.

455
00:22:42,169 --> 00:22:44,630
(dramatic music)

456
00:22:47,633 --> 00:22:51,053
- Yoo-hoo Big Night Stick,
are you still out there.

457
00:22:51,387 --> 00:22:52,513
Get a listen to this.

458
00:22:53,889 --> 00:22:55,891
- Here's my mating call.

459
00:22:56,225 --> 00:22:58,143
(howling)

460
00:23:01,105 --> 00:23:04,024
(panting heavily)

461
00:23:07,569 --> 00:23:11,907
(officer clearing his throat)

462
00:23:12,241 --> 00:23:13,283
- What do you two
think you're doing?

463
00:23:13,617 --> 00:23:14,952
- Commissioner.

464
00:23:15,285 --> 00:23:17,079
- I knew it had to be them.

465
00:23:18,831 --> 00:23:22,418
- But, we were just doing
what Jeannie taught us.

466
00:23:24,461 --> 00:23:26,088
- And who were you
just speaking to?

467
00:23:27,715 --> 00:23:30,759
- No one important, just some
guy named Big Night Stick.

468
00:23:31,093 --> 00:23:33,303
Sounded like he
was having a party.

469
00:23:33,637 --> 00:23:34,972
- Yeah, and what a dweeb.

470
00:23:35,305 --> 00:23:36,557
(laughs)

471
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:38,767
- Girls, you were talking
over the police radio.

472
00:23:39,101 --> 00:23:41,937
- And I'd like you to meet,
Big Night Stick, sorry.

473
00:23:42,271 --> 00:23:42,980
(dramatic music)

474
00:23:43,313 --> 00:23:46,275
- What, that's you?

475
00:23:46,608 --> 00:23:48,152
- I was right in the
middle of gunfire

476
00:23:48,485 --> 00:23:50,195
and these two are
screwing around.

477
00:23:50,529 --> 00:23:52,114
They're trying to get me killed.

478
00:23:52,448 --> 00:23:55,576
- This is a police station,
not a dating service.

479
00:23:55,909 --> 00:23:57,786
- Sir, it's their
first day, I'm sure

480
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,538
it was just an innocent mistake.

481
00:23:59,872 --> 00:24:01,623
- No, no, that's it, I
want these two fired.

482
00:24:01,957 --> 00:24:04,543
And you know my feelings about
having women on the force.

483
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:08,422
- What's that about
women on the force?

484
00:24:08,756 --> 00:24:10,591
- They're not good for nothing.

485
00:24:10,924 --> 00:24:12,760
- That's anything,
and you're wrong.

486
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,888
- I want 'em out of here.

487
00:24:18,682 --> 00:24:20,851
Hey, I'm warning you,
it's either me or them.

488
00:24:22,311 --> 00:24:24,688
- Commissioner, the
ceremony's starting.

489
00:24:25,022 --> 00:24:25,981
They're waiting for you.

490
00:24:26,315 --> 00:24:29,526
- I'll be right there,
Petrolino, come on.

491
00:24:33,489 --> 00:24:35,741
- Come along, girls.

492
00:24:36,075 --> 00:24:38,535
(dramatic music)

493
00:24:49,922 --> 00:24:51,673
- Take it easy, slime bucket.

494
00:24:57,346 --> 00:25:00,057
(phone ringing)

495
00:25:03,811 --> 00:25:05,062
- Excuse me.

496
00:25:05,395 --> 00:25:06,271
- No damage done.

497
00:25:16,949 --> 00:25:19,493
(water bubbling)

498
00:25:36,343 --> 00:25:38,595
- [Lady In Car] How did it
go, did anyone spot you?

499
00:25:38,929 --> 00:25:40,556
- Nope, and
everything's in place.

500
00:25:41,557 --> 00:25:44,184
- Ah, perfect.

501
00:25:44,518 --> 00:25:47,855
I hope they're ready for their
first taste of Spanish Fly.

502
00:25:48,188 --> 00:25:50,524
(both laughing)

503
00:25:57,156 --> 00:25:57,823
- Mmm.

504
00:25:59,992 --> 00:26:04,288
- Oh good, our first victim.

505
00:26:04,621 --> 00:26:07,207
(both laughing)

506
00:26:12,504 --> 00:26:15,299
(all chattering)

507
00:26:19,469 --> 00:26:22,347
(officers laughing)

508
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:31,899
(light synth music)
(Ms. Devonshire laughing)

509
00:26:32,232 --> 00:26:32,983
- Excuse me.

510
00:26:33,984 --> 00:26:35,194
(clearing throat)

511
00:26:35,527 --> 00:26:38,155
- Yello, welcome
to our assembly.

512
00:26:38,488 --> 00:26:40,824
May I present Ms. Devonshire.

513
00:26:41,158 --> 00:26:42,201
(Ms. Devonshire laughing)

514
00:26:42,534 --> 00:26:44,328
Now she's here to
introduce two of the finest

515
00:26:44,661 --> 00:26:45,996
Vice Academy students
who are about

516
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:49,958
to become new additions to
our force, Ms. Devonshire.

517
00:26:50,292 --> 00:26:51,376
(all clapping)

518
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:55,255
(light synth music)
(Ms. Devonshire laughing)

519
00:26:55,589 --> 00:27:00,302
- Thank you Commissioner and
fellow officers of the law.

520
00:27:02,054 --> 00:27:04,723
Ooh is it getting warm in here?

521
00:27:05,057 --> 00:27:08,185
(Ms. Devonshire groaning)

522
00:27:09,603 --> 00:27:11,271
Oh Commissioner,
fellow officers,

523
00:27:11,605 --> 00:27:15,192
oh may I present
the two graduates

524
00:27:22,074 --> 00:27:26,954
who made my life, oh is
it hot in here or what?

525
00:27:29,248 --> 00:27:31,250
Oh, does anybody want to dance?

526
00:27:32,292 --> 00:27:34,169
Oh yes, oh it's so warm.

527
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:38,257
(jazzy music)

528
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:39,341
Oooh, ooooh.

529
00:27:40,634 --> 00:27:42,678
- Ms devonshire, Ms.
Devonshire, Ms. Devonshire,

530
00:27:43,011 --> 00:27:45,222
perhaps I can finish your
speech for you all right.

531
00:27:45,555 --> 00:27:47,349
- Oh dip me, dip me.

532
00:27:48,558 --> 00:27:49,226
- Dip you.

533
00:27:52,145 --> 00:27:53,313
- [Didi] What's the
matter with her?

534
00:27:53,647 --> 00:27:54,982
- [Holly] I don't know, go
get her some more water.

535
00:27:55,315 --> 00:27:55,857
- Yeah.

536
00:27:56,191 --> 00:27:56,733
- Oh.

537
00:27:59,444 --> 00:28:01,905
(water bubbling)

538
00:28:02,948 --> 00:28:03,615
- Here.

539
00:28:05,701 --> 00:28:07,995
- That's good, that's good.

540
00:28:08,328 --> 00:28:10,664
(both laughing)

541
00:28:11,623 --> 00:28:12,708
- Hand me the walkie-talkie.

542
00:28:13,041 --> 00:28:15,460
(dramatic music)

543
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:22,217
Come on.

544
00:28:29,391 --> 00:28:30,434
Oh come on.

545
00:28:32,477 --> 00:28:34,146
Attention fools,
attention fools.

546
00:28:37,024 --> 00:28:39,276
(laughs)

547
00:28:39,609 --> 00:28:43,905
You've just had your first
demonstration of my power.

548
00:28:44,239 --> 00:28:45,407
(laughs)

549
00:28:45,741 --> 00:28:48,035
I've tainted the
water in your cooler

550
00:28:48,368 --> 00:28:50,287
with my very special formula.

551
00:28:52,331 --> 00:28:53,540
(spitting)

552
00:28:53,874 --> 00:28:56,543
This is your first
taste of Spanish Fly.

553
00:28:56,877 --> 00:29:01,173
And in heavier doses it can
destroy an entire population.

554
00:29:02,591 --> 00:29:05,135
And if I don't get

555
00:29:05,469 --> 00:29:10,223
in the next 48 hours, oh I'm
gonna have to contaminate

556
00:29:11,475 --> 00:29:13,226
the whole water
supply in the country.

557
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,312
(laughs)

558
00:29:15,645 --> 00:29:17,898
I'll call you later with my plan

559
00:29:18,231 --> 00:29:20,400
of where I want my
money delivered.

560
00:29:22,652 --> 00:29:25,322
Heed my warning, fools.

561
00:29:25,655 --> 00:29:27,240
(laughs)

562
00:29:27,574 --> 00:29:28,241
Come on, burn rubber.

563
00:29:28,575 --> 00:29:31,244
(suspenseful music)

564
00:29:31,578 --> 00:29:36,333
(laughing)
(tires screeching)

565
00:29:37,501 --> 00:29:39,086
- This is an outrage.

566
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:42,255
Oh she's beyond reasoning.

567
00:29:42,589 --> 00:29:43,632
In the past I thought all her

568
00:29:43,965 --> 00:29:46,134
warnings were just idle threats.

569
00:29:46,468 --> 00:29:48,261
Imagine contaminating the water

570
00:29:48,595 --> 00:29:50,222
supply in the police station.

571
00:29:50,555 --> 00:29:53,016
Is there no justice?

572
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:54,601
- She's right, she's right.

573
00:29:54,935 --> 00:29:57,145
Go over there and make sure
nobody uses that water cooler

574
00:29:57,479 --> 00:29:59,398
until there's a
full investigation.

575
00:29:59,731 --> 00:30:00,273
- Yes, sir.

576
00:30:01,608 --> 00:30:04,903
- It's rumored that
Spanish Fly's headquarters

577
00:30:05,237 --> 00:30:09,991
are hidden within the
Vicearama, the sleaziest,

578
00:30:11,326 --> 00:30:14,287
seediest, and vilest
nightclub in town.

579
00:30:14,621 --> 00:30:16,456
- That place isn't so
bad, they have good

580
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:18,375
drink specials at happy hour.

581
00:30:18,708 --> 00:30:19,626
- Shut up!

582
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:22,671
Commissioner, I want
you to make an exception

583
00:30:23,004 --> 00:30:26,049
and let these girls
get jobs there.

584
00:30:26,383 --> 00:30:28,218
If anyone can go
undercover in that

585
00:30:28,552 --> 00:30:31,304
sleaze pit, it's these two.

586
00:30:31,638 --> 00:30:33,682
If that is Spanish
Fly's hideout,

587
00:30:34,015 --> 00:30:36,518
she's got a big surprise coming.

588
00:30:37,936 --> 00:30:39,604
- Anything you say,
Ms. Devonshire.

589
00:30:39,938 --> 00:30:41,064
- We'll get right on it.

590
00:30:41,398 --> 00:30:42,399
- You can count on us.

591
00:30:42,732 --> 00:30:45,152
(upbeat music)

592
00:30:47,654 --> 00:30:48,989
- You must have a lot of
faith in those two girls

593
00:30:49,322 --> 00:30:51,533
to give them such an
important assignment.

594
00:30:51,867 --> 00:30:54,786
- Yes, I think
the world of them.

595
00:30:58,206 --> 00:30:58,832
Thank you.

596
00:31:03,712 --> 00:31:05,297
- I really like your suit.

597
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:06,548
- This old thing?

598
00:31:06,882 --> 00:31:09,342
(upbeat music)

599
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:16,933
- Come on, I'll drive.

600
00:31:17,267 --> 00:31:18,101
- Can I trust you?

601
00:31:18,435 --> 00:31:18,977
- Sure.

602
00:31:40,707 --> 00:31:43,293
- You still listen
to 8-track tapes?

603
00:31:43,627 --> 00:31:44,794
- No, I have a CD player.

604
00:31:45,128 --> 00:31:48,590
I just keep those on the dash
so nobody'll steal my radio.

605
00:31:48,924 --> 00:31:50,675
Wait 'til you hear
my sound system.

606
00:31:52,052 --> 00:31:56,890
(rock music)
(tires screeching)

607
00:32:18,787 --> 00:32:20,997
Oh come on, it wasn't that loud.

608
00:32:21,331 --> 00:32:21,873
- What!

609
00:32:25,585 --> 00:32:30,465
(upbeat electronic music)
(club goers cheering)

610
00:32:36,846 --> 00:32:38,473
- Can I help you two?

611
00:32:38,807 --> 00:32:41,518
- Yes, we're here to
apply for the job opening.

612
00:32:41,851 --> 00:32:44,104
- Oh I see, come in, meet me

613
00:32:44,437 --> 00:32:46,690
in my back office
in a few minutes.

614
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:50,151
- We got the interview, come on

615
00:32:50,485 --> 00:32:51,820
the place should
be cooking already.

616
00:32:52,153 --> 00:32:52,654
- What?

617
00:33:10,088 --> 00:33:12,549
- Hey, we're dressing in here.

618
00:33:12,882 --> 00:33:14,509
- I need this room, hurry up.

619
00:33:14,843 --> 00:33:17,971
- And close the door,
people can look in here.

620
00:33:18,305 --> 00:33:20,181
- It's nothing they're not gonna
see in a couple of minutes.

621
00:33:20,515 --> 00:33:23,310
- Hey, fuck you.

622
00:33:23,643 --> 00:33:24,394
(laughing)

623
00:33:24,728 --> 00:33:25,270
- Hey, ah.

624
00:33:34,321 --> 00:33:35,572
- I don't like
this place already.

625
00:33:35,905 --> 00:33:36,865
I feel like all the men here

626
00:33:37,198 --> 00:33:38,992
are undressing me
with their eyes.

627
00:33:39,326 --> 00:33:41,911
- It's just your imagination,
try to look like you fit in.

628
00:33:42,245 --> 00:33:42,829
- What are you trying to--

629
00:33:43,163 --> 00:33:44,497
- [Waitress] Coming through.

630
00:33:44,831 --> 00:33:45,790
- What, are you trying
to say it doesn't

631
00:33:46,124 --> 00:33:47,208
look like I can
fool these people?

632
00:33:48,501 --> 00:33:50,170
- No, it's just you're
always so uptight.

633
00:33:50,503 --> 00:33:51,046
- Is that so?

634
00:33:52,672 --> 00:33:57,052
(upbeat electronic music)
(club goers cheering)

635
00:35:22,095 --> 00:35:23,513
I can't find my wallet.

636
00:35:23,847 --> 00:35:24,389
- Didi.

637
00:35:31,896 --> 00:35:34,065
- You know this is illegal.

638
00:35:48,830 --> 00:35:49,914
- Have a seat.

639
00:35:53,418 --> 00:35:54,836
I hope you girls realize that

640
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:58,798
there's only one
position available.

641
00:35:59,132 --> 00:36:00,967
- Good, may the best one win.

642
00:36:02,093 --> 00:36:04,804
(body thudding)

643
00:36:06,931 --> 00:36:08,725
Remember, working as a team.

644
00:36:12,687 --> 00:36:15,940
- What makes you feel that
you're qualified for this job?

645
00:36:18,568 --> 00:36:21,112
- My morals are low
and so is my IQ.

646
00:36:26,618 --> 00:36:28,077
- And what about you?

647
00:36:28,411 --> 00:36:31,080
- I'll do anything
to get this job.

648
00:36:37,462 --> 00:36:38,129
- So Will I.

649
00:36:39,756 --> 00:36:42,091
- Are you two sure you know
what we're looking for?

650
00:36:43,468 --> 00:36:46,387
- No, but whatever
it is, I'll do it.

651
00:36:48,932 --> 00:36:51,142
- I was born doing it.

652
00:36:51,476 --> 00:36:52,477
(laughing)

653
00:36:52,811 --> 00:36:54,145
- Listen girls, I
think there's been

654
00:36:54,479 --> 00:36:56,022
some kind of mistake here.

655
00:36:56,356 --> 00:36:57,690
- What do you mean?

656
00:36:58,024 --> 00:37:00,777
- The job that's available
is for a bookkeeper.

657
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:03,196
Neither one of you
two are qualified.

658
00:37:03,530 --> 00:37:04,197
- [Both] A bookkeeper?

659
00:37:06,115 --> 00:37:07,784
(upbeat music)

660
00:37:08,117 --> 00:37:09,410
- This was all your fault.

661
00:37:09,744 --> 00:37:12,205
- My fault, what about
your vulgar display?

662
00:37:12,539 --> 00:37:13,957
- What you did was low.

663
00:37:14,290 --> 00:37:16,000
- I wanted to be
that bookkeeper.

664
00:37:18,211 --> 00:37:21,130
(crowd cheering)

665
00:37:21,464 --> 00:37:24,634
(upbeat music)

666
00:37:24,968 --> 00:37:26,177
- You mean out of
the two of you,

667
00:37:26,511 --> 00:37:28,805
neither one was
able to get the job?

668
00:37:29,138 --> 00:37:30,348
- We tried.

669
00:37:30,682 --> 00:37:31,808
- This is unbelievable.

670
00:37:32,141 --> 00:37:34,561
Do you realize how bad
you're making me look?

671
00:37:34,894 --> 00:37:37,021
What am I supposed to
tell the commissioner now?

672
00:37:37,355 --> 00:37:38,940
- It wasn't my fault.

673
00:37:39,274 --> 00:37:41,776
I didn't know the job
was for a bookkeeper.

674
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:43,903
I was just trying to
act cheap like Didi.

675
00:37:44,237 --> 00:37:44,946
- That's enough.

676
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,490
I hope you realize that
Petrolino has already

677
00:37:47,824 --> 00:37:50,743
put in a request to have the
two of you taken off the force.

678
00:37:51,077 --> 00:37:54,831
And with both of you out of
here, I'll lose my job also.

679
00:37:55,164 --> 00:37:57,625
(dramatic music)

680
00:37:58,710 --> 00:37:59,878
Taken off the force, taken off

681
00:38:00,211 --> 00:38:00,879
the force, taken off the force.

682
00:38:03,798 --> 00:38:06,092
That's right, we're gonna
break out of here tonight.

683
00:38:06,426 --> 00:38:09,012
And if you aren't with
us, we're gonna shoot you.

684
00:38:09,345 --> 00:38:13,474
(girl screaming)
(gun firing)

685
00:38:13,808 --> 00:38:15,768
Both of you out of here,
both of you out of here.

686
00:38:16,102 --> 00:38:18,688
Both of you out of here.

687
00:38:19,022 --> 00:38:21,441
I'd like you to meet
your new cellmate.

688
00:38:23,234 --> 00:38:24,068
- She's cute.

689
00:38:27,947 --> 00:38:29,699
- I lose my job also,

690
00:38:30,033 --> 00:38:32,243
lose my job also,
I lose my job also.

691
00:38:33,328 --> 00:38:34,704
(festive music)

692
00:38:35,038 --> 00:38:35,997
That's enough.

693
00:38:40,835 --> 00:38:42,879
Now, you little
monsters are gonna

694
00:38:43,212 --> 00:38:44,839
play pin the tail on the donkey

695
00:38:45,173 --> 00:38:46,925
whether you like it or not.

696
00:38:47,258 --> 00:38:49,010
Now begin.

697
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:54,098
(gun firing)
(kids screaming)

698
00:38:55,183 --> 00:38:58,853
Oh, either the two
of you start working

699
00:38:59,187 --> 00:39:02,148
together as a team or
suffer the consequences.

700
00:39:02,482 --> 00:39:06,945
(dramatic music)
(Petrolino laughing)

701
00:39:07,278 --> 00:39:09,822
- Well I'll see you
later for our date.

702
00:39:10,156 --> 00:39:11,074
- Sure thing, babe.

703
00:39:11,407 --> 00:39:12,784
Hey listen, I'll get
you off the switchboard

704
00:39:13,117 --> 00:39:15,286
and have you a better
job before you know it.

705
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:16,412
- You're so sweet.

706
00:39:16,746 --> 00:39:17,497
- Oh I know.

707
00:39:30,093 --> 00:39:33,221
- I just remembered, I have
a very important appointment.

708
00:39:33,554 --> 00:39:34,931
- Oh, me too, likewise.

709
00:39:35,264 --> 00:39:37,767
(upbeat music)

710
00:39:48,403 --> 00:39:49,320
- Hi there.

711
00:39:49,654 --> 00:39:51,698
- What the hell do you want?

712
00:39:52,031 --> 00:39:55,284
- I wanted to apologize
for my previous behavior.

713
00:39:55,618 --> 00:39:57,245
Took me a while to
come to my senses.

714
00:39:58,579 --> 00:40:00,915
- Yeah, so what are
you trying to say?

715
00:40:01,249 --> 00:40:02,875
- Well I finally
realized what a hunk

716
00:40:03,209 --> 00:40:05,086
of man you are
and I'd be foolish

717
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:07,839
not to take a sample
of that Grade-A beef.

718
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:13,928
- I see, so you got
anything in mind?

719
00:40:14,262 --> 00:40:15,221
- You tell me when and where.

720
00:40:15,555 --> 00:40:18,057
(upbeat music)

721
00:40:19,142 --> 00:40:21,060
- Hmm, I think I
can squeeze you in

722
00:40:21,394 --> 00:40:22,937
tonight about eight o'clock.

723
00:40:23,271 --> 00:40:24,856
How does that sound?

724
00:40:25,189 --> 00:40:26,190
- I'll be there with bells on.

725
00:40:26,524 --> 00:40:30,403
- Great, look up my
address in the white pages.

726
00:40:30,737 --> 00:40:31,404
I deliver.

727
00:40:45,251 --> 00:40:50,089
- Officer Petrolino, where
have you been hiding yourself?

728
00:40:51,466 --> 00:40:52,300
Got any plans for
dinner tonight?

729
00:40:55,428 --> 00:40:57,764
(jazz music)

730
00:41:02,351 --> 00:41:05,021
- Didi, right on time.

731
00:41:05,354 --> 00:41:07,023
- Hi.

732
00:41:07,356 --> 00:41:09,817
- I guess you don't like
to keep your studs waiting.

733
00:41:11,152 --> 00:41:14,030
- What a lovely table
setting, I'm impressed.

734
00:41:14,363 --> 00:41:14,906
- Oh thank you.

735
00:41:15,865 --> 00:41:16,741
- What's for dinner?

736
00:41:18,326 --> 00:41:20,620
- Well see it's a special
one of a kind dish.

737
00:41:20,953 --> 00:41:23,247
I call it beef Petrolino.

738
00:41:26,334 --> 00:41:27,460
- What are the ingredients?

739
00:41:29,045 --> 00:41:30,421
(Petrolino clears throat)

740
00:41:30,755 --> 00:41:31,756
- You're looking at 'em.

741
00:41:34,092 --> 00:41:35,301
- Where's your bathroom?

742
00:41:35,635 --> 00:41:37,261
- Oh it's right inside.

743
00:41:38,554 --> 00:41:39,138
- Excuse me.

744
00:41:39,472 --> 00:41:40,264
- Sure.

745
00:41:47,355 --> 00:41:49,774
(Didi retching)

746
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:56,155
(toilet flushing)

747
00:41:56,489 --> 00:41:57,824
Hey, I got a surprise for you.

748
00:41:59,367 --> 00:41:59,951
- Really?

749
00:42:01,244 --> 00:42:05,206
- How'd you like to wear
this and make me happy?

750
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:06,958
- I'd love to.

751
00:42:08,334 --> 00:42:10,211
- Great, my bedroom's
right in there.

752
00:42:11,629 --> 00:42:13,131
Why don't you change and
I'll meet you in a minute?

753
00:42:13,464 --> 00:42:15,216
- I can hardly wait.

754
00:42:26,894 --> 00:42:28,437
(phone ringing)

755
00:42:28,771 --> 00:42:30,606
- [Petrolino] Hello
you lucky girl you,

756
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:32,900
I can't take your
call right now.

757
00:42:33,234 --> 00:42:36,821
Leave me your name and number
so I can make your day.

758
00:42:37,155 --> 00:42:38,948
- [Jeannie] Hi, this is Jeannie,

759
00:42:39,282 --> 00:42:40,241
I just wanted to tell you what

760
00:42:40,575 --> 00:42:43,119
a great time I
just had with you.

761
00:42:43,452 --> 00:42:45,538
I'm really sorry that
I had to run off.

762
00:42:45,872 --> 00:42:48,207
I would have loved to have
spent the whole night.

763
00:42:49,584 --> 00:42:53,212
Oh by the way, I left my
underwear with you by mistake.

764
00:42:53,546 --> 00:42:56,174
You can't miss it, it's
the green sparkly ones.

765
00:42:56,507 --> 00:42:57,842
They're probably still warm.

766
00:42:58,176 --> 00:42:59,886
(laughing)

767
00:43:00,219 --> 00:43:01,012
- They are still warm.

768
00:43:03,264 --> 00:43:03,931
Eww yuck!

769
00:43:06,267 --> 00:43:08,186
- [Jeannie] I'll just get
it back from you next time.

770
00:43:08,519 --> 00:43:11,355
Just remember that
they're mine, bye now.

771
00:43:13,482 --> 00:43:14,358
- I can't stay.

772
00:43:15,318 --> 00:43:16,819
- What's the matter?

773
00:43:17,153 --> 00:43:20,907
- I'm going to the hospital to
have a severe conniption fit.

774
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:23,242
(Didi sighing)

775
00:43:23,576 --> 00:43:24,285
(door clicking)

776
00:43:24,619 --> 00:43:25,161
- What a pity.

777
00:43:27,872 --> 00:43:30,208
(upbeat music)

778
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:40,426
- Hi.

779
00:43:41,844 --> 00:43:44,305
- Oh Holly, well
you're the early bird.

780
00:43:45,681 --> 00:43:47,433
- Well I wanted to
get it over with.

781
00:43:49,602 --> 00:43:53,147
I mean, wild horses
couldn't keep me away.

782
00:43:53,481 --> 00:43:56,317
(Petrolino chuckling)

783
00:43:56,651 --> 00:43:58,194
- So, you made dinner.

784
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:01,113
- No, it didn't turn out right.

785
00:44:04,742 --> 00:44:06,285
- Are you looking for something?

786
00:44:06,619 --> 00:44:08,454
- Well I did have something
I wanted you to wear

787
00:44:08,788 --> 00:44:10,623
but I don't see where it went.

788
00:44:10,957 --> 00:44:12,416
- That's okay I brought my own.

789
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:18,256
Do you like it?

790
00:44:19,882 --> 00:44:20,549
- Oh yeah.

791
00:44:21,842 --> 00:44:24,136
- Listen I think
I'ma go freshen up.

792
00:44:24,470 --> 00:44:27,807
- Oh wait, I have a
special present for you.

793
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:29,642
- Really, that's sweet.

794
00:44:32,186 --> 00:44:34,814
- Here, your own
personal toothbrush.

795
00:44:36,524 --> 00:44:38,567
- Wow, thanks.

796
00:44:41,654 --> 00:44:43,239
I'll be right back.

797
00:45:06,137 --> 00:45:06,929
(sighs)

798
00:45:07,263 --> 00:45:09,473
11 years in private school,

799
00:45:09,807 --> 00:45:12,476
two years at the police
academy and now this.

800
00:45:13,936 --> 00:45:15,479
If my father could
only see me now.

801
00:45:18,816 --> 00:45:19,483
Great.

802
00:45:23,404 --> 00:45:25,489
(sighing)

803
00:45:30,494 --> 00:45:33,581
- I bet you thought about me
the whole time you were gone.

804
00:45:33,914 --> 00:45:34,457
- That I did.

805
00:45:38,544 --> 00:45:40,421
Please let it be over
quick, please let

806
00:45:40,755 --> 00:45:42,423
me be able to imagine that
I'm with someone else.

807
00:45:42,757 --> 00:45:44,258
Please don't let him
leave the lights on.

808
00:45:44,592 --> 00:45:45,593
- Did you say something?

809
00:45:46,802 --> 00:45:47,470
- No.

810
00:45:56,604 --> 00:45:57,396
- Ooh, ooh.

811
00:46:01,317 --> 00:46:02,777
(phone ringing)

812
00:46:03,110 --> 00:46:07,365
Hello you lucky girl you, I
can't take your call right now.

813
00:46:07,698 --> 00:46:09,283
I'm sorry, I'll
just be a minute.

814
00:46:11,660 --> 00:46:12,328
- Take your time.

815
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:17,416
- Hello.

816
00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:18,667
(clears throat)

817
00:46:19,001 --> 00:46:22,421
Shaunie, yeah long time no see.

818
00:46:25,674 --> 00:46:27,885
Yeah, sure I got time for you.

819
00:46:28,219 --> 00:46:29,720
What are you doing
in about an hour?

820
00:46:31,389 --> 00:46:34,350
Yeah, oh no, no, no, I'm not
doing anything important.

821
00:46:35,601 --> 00:46:37,478
Actually I can
hardly wait to have

822
00:46:37,812 --> 00:46:39,563
your hot mouth on my body again.

823
00:46:39,897 --> 00:46:41,315
(chuckles)

824
00:46:41,649 --> 00:46:44,276
Yeah, yeah, I'll see
you in a little while.

825
00:46:44,610 --> 00:46:47,905
Oh and I'll have your special
toothbrush waiting for you.

826
00:46:50,491 --> 00:46:51,367
Yeah, bye.

827
00:46:55,621 --> 00:46:57,498
Hey, where you going?

828
00:46:57,832 --> 00:46:59,708
- I have never seen
so much colossal

829
00:47:00,042 --> 00:47:01,293
nerve before in my entire life.

830
00:47:01,627 --> 00:47:03,129
How could you make
a date with her

831
00:47:03,462 --> 00:47:05,297
when I was still
in bed with you?

832
00:47:05,631 --> 00:47:08,968
- Yeah but you get the benefit
of her making me horny.

833
00:47:09,301 --> 00:47:09,844
- Ugh!

834
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:13,347
Yuck!

835
00:47:17,059 --> 00:47:18,352
- Hey wait, come back.

836
00:47:18,686 --> 00:47:21,147
You haven't even
tried my hot tub yet.

837
00:47:23,190 --> 00:47:25,568
(upbeat music)

838
00:47:31,407 --> 00:47:32,074
- Hi y'all.

839
00:47:32,408 --> 00:47:32,950
- Hi.

840
00:47:35,369 --> 00:47:36,662
- I heard about the three ways

841
00:47:36,996 --> 00:47:39,957
you two had with
Petrolino last night.

842
00:47:40,291 --> 00:47:40,833
- What?

843
00:47:42,585 --> 00:47:44,462
- I thought it sounded
pretty raunchy to me.

844
00:47:46,547 --> 00:47:47,798
- Where did you hear this?

845
00:47:48,841 --> 00:47:50,843
(laughs)

846
00:47:51,177 --> 00:47:52,928
- Well in the men's locker room.

847
00:47:53,971 --> 00:47:55,764
- The men's locker room, huh?

848
00:47:56,098 --> 00:47:58,017
- How did you get in there?

849
00:47:58,350 --> 00:48:00,227
- Oh I just throw my
hair up in a baseball cap

850
00:48:00,561 --> 00:48:03,230
and wrap a towel around me and
no one even knows I'm there.

851
00:48:05,191 --> 00:48:08,068
- Listen that story
is 100% fiction.

852
00:48:09,445 --> 00:48:11,238
- Yeah, and I saw
Elvis at the mall.

853
00:48:12,698 --> 00:48:15,451
- This is ridiculous, how can
you even listen to that shit?

854
00:48:16,785 --> 00:48:19,580
- Well all the other officers
seem to believe it too.

855
00:48:19,914 --> 00:48:20,456
- What?

856
00:48:23,667 --> 00:48:26,295
- I can't believe you had the
nerve to go to his apartment.

857
00:48:26,629 --> 00:48:27,379
- Oh, what's the difference?

858
00:48:27,713 --> 00:48:29,006
It didn't work for
either one of us.

859
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:30,716
- Well I didn't let him
touch me, what about you?

860
00:48:31,050 --> 00:48:33,427
- Oh get serious, if you
didn't did you think I would?

861
00:48:33,761 --> 00:48:35,304
(men laughing)

862
00:48:35,638 --> 00:48:36,472
Shush.

863
00:48:36,805 --> 00:48:39,308
(men laughing)

864
00:48:40,684 --> 00:48:42,478
- First we went
around the world,

865
00:48:42,811 --> 00:48:45,564
then I was the meat
in their sandwich.

866
00:48:45,898 --> 00:48:48,484
- The things you see when
you don't have a camera.

867
00:48:48,817 --> 00:48:50,319
- Yeah man, that Didi and Holly,

868
00:48:50,653 --> 00:48:54,073
I never seen two babes more
happy with my body, my life.

869
00:48:54,406 --> 00:48:57,159
(man laughing)

870
00:48:57,493 --> 00:48:58,536
- That does it.

871
00:48:58,869 --> 00:49:00,412
(dramatic music)

872
00:49:00,746 --> 00:49:01,747
(door slamming)

873
00:49:02,081 --> 00:49:03,624
- Hey, this is the
men's locker room.

874
00:49:04,833 --> 00:49:05,626
- [Didi] Shut up.

875
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:07,419
- Hey what are
you doing in here?

876
00:49:09,672 --> 00:49:14,552
- Ha, Big Night Stick,
more like cocktail weenie.

877
00:49:15,261 --> 00:49:15,970
(laughs)

878
00:49:16,303 --> 00:49:17,304
- Hey you know what, I never hit

879
00:49:17,638 --> 00:49:18,472
a woman before in
my life but I'm--

880
00:49:18,806 --> 00:49:20,558
- Go on, come on I dare you.

881
00:49:20,891 --> 00:49:22,935
Slap me senseless,
punch my lights out.

882
00:49:23,269 --> 00:49:25,062
- Hey, I'm warning you.

883
00:49:25,396 --> 00:49:27,982
- Go on I dare you,
if you're man enough.

884
00:49:29,275 --> 00:49:32,486
(Petrolino grunting)

885
00:49:32,820 --> 00:49:35,531
(dramatic music)

886
00:49:38,367 --> 00:49:39,493
(ominous music)

887
00:49:39,827 --> 00:49:42,746
- The map is completed,
every major water supply

888
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:45,374
in the United States
has been marked.

889
00:49:46,750 --> 00:49:49,086
And if they don't give
us the 20 million dollars

890
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:51,213
that we've asked
for, we're ready

891
00:49:51,547 --> 00:49:55,843
to show them we mean business.

892
00:49:56,176 --> 00:49:58,971
- 20 million bucks
is a lot of money.

893
00:49:59,305 --> 00:50:02,641
- Yeah, I can hardly
wait to get my cut.

894
00:50:02,975 --> 00:50:07,730
- Your cut, girls you make
400 bucks a week at the club.

895
00:50:08,814 --> 00:50:10,149
If I have to share
this money with you,

896
00:50:10,482 --> 00:50:12,776
I can't pay you your
regular salaries.

897
00:50:13,902 --> 00:50:15,029
You wouldn't want to miss out on

898
00:50:15,362 --> 00:50:17,823
your guaranteed 400
bucks a week, would you?

899
00:50:19,199 --> 00:50:20,618
- Well, no.

900
00:50:22,536 --> 00:50:23,787
- Me neither.

901
00:50:24,121 --> 00:50:25,497
- Good, hand me the telephone.

902
00:50:28,459 --> 00:50:29,126
Thank you.

903
00:50:30,336 --> 00:50:32,504
Now be quiet, I don't want them

904
00:50:32,838 --> 00:50:35,007
to know our location, okay?

905
00:50:35,341 --> 00:50:35,883
Good.

906
00:50:37,009 --> 00:50:39,428
(phone dialing)

907
00:50:39,762 --> 00:50:42,181
(humming)

908
00:50:42,514 --> 00:50:43,932
(phone ringing)

909
00:50:44,266 --> 00:50:45,643
- Devonshire here.

910
00:50:45,976 --> 00:50:50,689
- All right Devonshire, this
is Spanish Fly, got that?

911
00:50:52,858 --> 00:50:57,696
Spanish Fly, I'm ready to
give you my list of demands

912
00:50:59,073 --> 00:51:02,701
and I expect every one
of them to be followed.

913
00:51:03,035 --> 00:51:05,746
And remember, you
know who this is

914
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:08,957
but you don't know
where I'm calling from.

915
00:51:09,291 --> 00:51:13,045
Hey got that, you don't
know where I'm calling from.

916
00:51:13,379 --> 00:51:14,338
(beeping)

917
00:51:14,672 --> 00:51:16,298
- [Operator] This
is the operator,

918
00:51:16,632 --> 00:51:19,593
I have an emergency phone
call for Spanish Fly

919
00:51:19,927 --> 00:51:24,682
at 555-3599, it's
from your mother.

920
00:51:26,225 --> 00:51:27,893
Do you wish to release the line?

921
00:51:28,227 --> 00:51:30,646
- No, I don't wish
to release the line!

922
00:51:35,943 --> 00:51:37,778
- That was Spanish
Fly, I've just got

923
00:51:38,112 --> 00:51:40,656
the phone number she
was calling from.

924
00:51:40,989 --> 00:51:44,535
We can run a make on it and
get her exact location now.

925
00:51:44,868 --> 00:51:47,413
- Good, good, good, 'cause
we're running out of time.

926
00:51:47,746 --> 00:51:49,373
- Now that we know
her whereabouts,

927
00:51:49,707 --> 00:51:52,000
I'm sure my girls can stop her.

928
00:51:53,210 --> 00:51:54,670
- You know, Ms. Devonshire,

929
00:51:55,003 --> 00:51:56,547
I've been meaning to talk
to you about those two.

930
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:58,382
- Well what about them?

931
00:51:58,716 --> 00:52:01,301
- Well I'm afraid they're
just not up to vice squad par.

932
00:52:01,635 --> 00:52:04,805
(paper ripping)

933
00:52:05,139 --> 00:52:07,057
This case is too important
to me for any more mistakes.

934
00:52:07,391 --> 00:52:08,600
Besides I've been
wanting to try out

935
00:52:08,934 --> 00:52:11,228
this new secret weapon
I've been working on.

936
00:52:11,562 --> 00:52:13,814
In fact, I'm revealing
it at the unveiling

937
00:52:14,148 --> 00:52:15,190
ceremony in just 10 minutes.

938
00:52:15,524 --> 00:52:18,068
Now I expect to see
you there, officer.

939
00:52:18,402 --> 00:52:20,863
(dramatic music)

940
00:52:24,950 --> 00:52:26,702
(all chattering)

941
00:52:27,035 --> 00:52:28,620
- Get out of my way.

942
00:52:35,753 --> 00:52:38,088
(quirky music)

943
00:52:46,847 --> 00:52:47,639
(bones crunching)

944
00:52:47,973 --> 00:52:51,602
Oh!

945
00:52:51,935 --> 00:52:54,146
(coughing)
(microphone feedback ringing)

946
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:56,815
- I'm sure that you all
understand the urgency

947
00:52:57,149 --> 00:52:58,567
which this meeting
has been called.

948
00:52:59,943 --> 00:53:01,695
Spanish Fly has proceeded
with her plans and up

949
00:53:02,029 --> 00:53:04,823
until now there's nothing
we've been able to do about it.

950
00:53:05,157 --> 00:53:07,201
We can make no more
mistakes on our part.

951
00:53:15,125 --> 00:53:17,753
We need a new vice
cop on the force.

952
00:53:19,463 --> 00:53:23,926
One who's fool proof, one who
won't make any more screw ups.

953
00:53:24,551 --> 00:53:26,053
(dramatic music)

954
00:53:26,386 --> 00:53:29,765
And now the final solution.

955
00:53:30,933 --> 00:53:34,937
May I present the future
of vice enforcement.

956
00:53:35,270 --> 00:53:38,774
Half woman, half
machine, all trash.

957
00:53:39,107 --> 00:53:39,900
I'd like you to meet,

958
00:53:43,237 --> 00:53:43,904
Bimbocop.

959
00:53:45,072 --> 00:53:45,906
- [Crowd] Ooh.

960
00:53:48,784 --> 00:53:51,119
(all clapping)

961
00:53:54,498 --> 00:53:57,417
- You can't be
serious, this robot

962
00:53:57,751 --> 00:54:00,504
isn't gonna replace my
girls on the vice force.

963
00:54:00,838 --> 00:54:01,922
- Oh no, she'll not
only replace 'em,

964
00:54:02,256 --> 00:54:03,924
she'll do a much better job too.

965
00:54:04,258 --> 00:54:06,385
Myron, Myron, where
are you, come out here.

966
00:54:06,718 --> 00:54:08,387
Myron, oh.

967
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:10,430
- And who is this?

968
00:54:10,764 --> 00:54:13,892
- This is Myron, he is
the creator of BimboCop.

969
00:54:14,226 --> 00:54:15,644
- And when did you
build this robot,

970
00:54:15,978 --> 00:54:17,855
between watching cartoons?

971
00:54:18,188 --> 00:54:19,898
- No, actually I built her

972
00:54:20,232 --> 00:54:21,817
while I was watching
music videos.

973
00:54:22,150 --> 00:54:24,194
(crowd murmuring)

974
00:54:24,528 --> 00:54:27,823
- I don't like it already
and I won't stand for it.

975
00:54:28,156 --> 00:54:31,159
- I agree completely, this
sets women back 100 years.

976
00:54:31,493 --> 00:54:32,786
- Oh no, no, no, give it a
chance, give it a chance.

977
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:33,996
Myron, demonstration.

978
00:54:37,165 --> 00:54:40,544
(electronic whirling)
(dramatic music)

979
00:54:40,878 --> 00:54:42,462
(Commissioner laughing)

980
00:54:42,796 --> 00:54:44,631
- Yes, but can she speak?

981
00:54:46,008 --> 00:54:46,800
(metal squeaking)

982
00:54:47,134 --> 00:54:50,470
- You're not deaf,
don't be dumb.

983
00:54:52,180 --> 00:54:53,807
- [Audience] Whoa.

984
00:54:54,141 --> 00:54:55,017
- I like her.

985
00:54:56,101 --> 00:54:57,769
- She looks a lot
like you, Didi,

986
00:54:58,103 --> 00:54:59,897
they must've made her
out of cheap metal.

987
00:55:00,981 --> 00:55:02,858
(metal squeaking)

988
00:55:03,191 --> 00:55:05,777
- Oh I forgot to mention,
the robot is very good

989
00:55:06,111 --> 00:55:07,988
at detecting who
its enemies are.

990
00:55:10,157 --> 00:55:11,491
- Tell us more.

991
00:55:11,825 --> 00:55:14,328
- Well, the access
code box sets her mood.

992
00:55:14,661 --> 00:55:15,662
(Jeannie laughing)

993
00:55:15,996 --> 00:55:16,997
You can choose the
setting you want.

994
00:55:17,331 --> 00:55:19,082
I can put her on
access code casual

995
00:55:19,416 --> 00:55:21,543
if you'd like to have a
conversation with her.

996
00:55:23,211 --> 00:55:25,881
(metal squeaking)

997
00:55:28,425 --> 00:55:30,969
Or access code vengeful,
and she'll find her enemies.

998
00:55:31,303 --> 00:55:33,889
(ominous music)

999
00:55:34,222 --> 00:55:36,016
Of course there's always
access code rampage,

1000
00:55:36,350 --> 00:55:37,935
but I can't show
you that one in here

1001
00:55:38,268 --> 00:55:38,977
(head thudding)
(Holly whimpering)

1002
00:55:39,311 --> 00:55:40,437
- No, no, of corse not.

1003
00:55:40,771 --> 00:55:42,981
Myron remind me to
give your school

1004
00:55:43,315 --> 00:55:44,983
a special donation for
all this fine work.

1005
00:55:45,317 --> 00:55:47,194
In fact, Ms. Devonshire,
write out a check

1006
00:55:47,527 --> 00:55:49,821
for $100 now, huh.

1007
00:55:50,155 --> 00:55:53,825
- But sir, the robot has
over $10,000 in parts alone.

1008
00:55:54,159 --> 00:55:54,910
Not to mention the medical bills

1009
00:55:55,243 --> 00:55:56,828
after my accident
with the welding.

1010
00:55:57,162 --> 00:56:00,415
- Ah what the hey,
make it a 150.

1011
00:56:00,749 --> 00:56:01,875
- This doesn't prove anything.

1012
00:56:02,209 --> 00:56:05,045
I'd like to see a demonstration
of the robot at work.

1013
00:56:05,379 --> 00:56:06,004
- Well certainly,
I'll just change

1014
00:56:06,338 --> 00:56:07,422
her to access code work mode.

1015
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:10,300
What job would you
like to see her do?

1016
00:56:10,634 --> 00:56:12,010
- I don't know, what
do you suggest, Myron?

1017
00:56:12,344 --> 00:56:14,972
- Would you like to see her
find and destroy her enemies?

1018
00:56:15,305 --> 00:56:16,014
- Oh yeah.

1019
00:56:16,348 --> 00:56:16,890
- No, not that.

1020
00:56:18,100 --> 00:56:19,893
- Let her do something easy.

1021
00:56:20,227 --> 00:56:22,396
- Yeah, that's a good idea.

1022
00:56:22,729 --> 00:56:24,523
I'll tell you what, let's
put her on the switchboard.

1023
00:56:24,856 --> 00:56:27,025
Why any dumbo can do that job.

1024
00:56:27,359 --> 00:56:29,111
- [Myron] She could
do that easily.

1025
00:56:29,444 --> 00:56:30,445
- Hey, wait a minute.

1026
00:56:30,779 --> 00:56:31,321
- Come on.

1027
00:56:32,656 --> 00:56:37,327
(dramatic music)
(metal squishing)

1028
00:57:00,559 --> 00:57:04,646
(alarm buzzing)
(electronic whirring)

1029
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:06,189
- A call's coming
in, what happens now?

1030
00:57:06,523 --> 00:57:07,607
- I'll just start her up.

1031
00:57:08,942 --> 00:57:12,029
(electronic whirring)

1032
00:57:13,780 --> 00:57:15,907
- Police station,
how may I serve you?

1033
00:57:16,241 --> 00:57:17,284
(voice squeaking)

1034
00:57:17,617 --> 00:57:21,872
Yes I know where that is, I'll
send someone out right away.

1035
00:57:23,248 --> 00:57:24,958
Would you like to hold on the
line until they get there?

1036
00:57:25,292 --> 00:57:26,084
(voice squeaking)

1037
00:57:26,418 --> 00:57:28,086
Yes, thank you.

1038
00:57:28,420 --> 00:57:31,423
Attention, there's been a
breaking and entering reported

1039
00:57:31,757 --> 00:57:34,509
at the corner of
Effie ad Rowena.

1040
00:57:34,843 --> 00:57:39,598
Officers 211 and 214 please
report at once, thank you.

1041
00:57:46,313 --> 00:57:48,106
- Isn't that amazing?

1042
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:49,858
- Yeah, real keen.

1043
00:57:50,192 --> 00:57:52,110
- I have another call, could you

1044
00:57:52,444 --> 00:57:53,945
please hold for just a minute?

1045
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:55,947
Thank you.

1046
00:57:57,282 --> 00:58:01,787
Hello, police station,
how may I serve you?

1047
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:04,790
Jeannie, it's Daddy Trucker.

1048
00:58:05,123 --> 00:58:06,374
I'll put him on for you.

1049
00:58:08,251 --> 00:58:08,877
- No wait.

1050
00:58:10,712 --> 00:58:12,255
Just take a message for me.

1051
00:58:14,299 --> 00:58:15,509
- [Trucker] Hey, little Jeannie,

1052
00:58:15,842 --> 00:58:17,803
I've got the party line waiting.

1053
00:58:18,136 --> 00:58:20,639
I've got my pants off already.

1054
00:58:20,972 --> 00:58:24,142
Have I got a little
present for you.

1055
00:58:24,476 --> 00:58:28,188
- And I also have a message
for you from your gynecologist.

1056
00:58:29,648 --> 00:58:32,067
He wants to remind you of
your appointment tomorrow.

1057
00:58:33,443 --> 00:58:36,363
He says he thinks
he has a new cream

1058
00:58:36,696 --> 00:58:38,907
to try on that rash of yours.

1059
00:58:40,283 --> 00:58:42,744
- Jeannie, I'd like a
word with you, right now.

1060
00:58:43,078 --> 00:58:45,497
(dramatic music)

1061
00:58:51,253 --> 00:58:54,714
- Fired, me fired?

1062
00:58:55,048 --> 00:58:56,258
How could you?

1063
00:58:56,591 --> 00:58:59,594
- Now, now, now, now, don't
think of it as fired Jeannie,

1064
00:58:59,928 --> 00:59:02,139
think of it as replaced.

1065
00:59:02,472 --> 00:59:05,267
- Replaced, by that
bucket of bolts?

1066
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:07,602
You haven't heard
the last of this yet.

1067
00:59:10,230 --> 00:59:13,024
Fired, me fired.

1068
00:59:14,025 --> 00:59:15,902
That damn robot got me fired.

1069
00:59:17,195 --> 00:59:19,739
You know, I work
hard for my paycheck

1070
00:59:20,073 --> 00:59:21,825
and I give my landlord
a piece of that.

1071
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:24,369
And now I'm gonna
be sitting on my ass

1072
00:59:24,703 --> 00:59:27,372
all month long, just what is
he gonna get a piece of now?

1073
00:59:27,706 --> 00:59:28,373
- All right, all right out.

1074
00:59:28,707 --> 00:59:29,958
- [Jeannie] Ooh.

1075
00:59:30,292 --> 00:59:31,918
- I want to make our move
on Vicearama tonight.

1076
00:59:32,252 --> 00:59:34,421
Now first, first we'll
call in the vice officers,

1077
00:59:34,754 --> 00:59:37,841
and then we'll
bring in BimboCop.

1078
00:59:38,175 --> 00:59:40,468
Oh Spanish Fly will
never know what hit her.

1079
00:59:40,802 --> 00:59:41,761
(laughs)

1080
00:59:42,095 --> 00:59:44,681
I want everyone
in tip top shape.

1081
00:59:45,015 --> 00:59:45,473
Come on, men.

1082
00:59:45,807 --> 00:59:48,310
(upbeat music)

1083
00:59:53,398 --> 00:59:54,524
(phone ringing)

1084
00:59:54,858 --> 00:59:57,235
- Commissioner, call
for you on line one.

1085
00:59:59,279 --> 00:59:59,988
- Hello, hello?

1086
01:00:04,492 --> 01:00:05,660
Hello, hello, hello?

1087
01:00:05,994 --> 01:00:08,413
(dramatic music)

1088
01:00:13,752 --> 01:00:16,087
- So take my job on the force,

1089
01:00:17,047 --> 01:00:18,506
well we'll just see about that.

1090
01:00:20,258 --> 01:00:23,261
(electronic beeping)

1091
01:00:27,390 --> 01:00:30,101
There now, let's just see
how much value you have

1092
01:00:30,435 --> 01:00:33,271
while you're set to
access code worthless.

1093
01:00:34,689 --> 01:00:36,399
There, I feel much better.

1094
01:00:40,904 --> 01:00:43,448
(dramatic music)

1095
01:01:06,429 --> 01:01:08,139
- Okay, we have an hour
to get into the club

1096
01:01:08,473 --> 01:01:11,518
and find Spanish Fly's hideout
before BimboCop gets here.

1097
01:01:11,851 --> 01:01:13,061
Are you ready to go inside?

1098
01:01:13,395 --> 01:01:14,521
- Let's just do it.

1099
01:01:14,854 --> 01:01:16,314
- And try to let me do
the talking this time.

1100
01:01:16,648 --> 01:01:18,275
- Don't start with
me again, Didi.

1101
01:01:22,654 --> 01:01:26,157
(upbeat electronic music)

1102
01:01:33,373 --> 01:01:35,333
- Yeah, what do you want?

1103
01:01:35,667 --> 01:01:36,876
- We're here to get to work.

1104
01:01:37,210 --> 01:01:38,503
- Oh yeah, none
of the women that

1105
01:01:38,837 --> 01:01:41,047
work here look as
cheap as you two.

1106
01:01:43,550 --> 01:01:45,218
Wait a minute, I
remember you two.

1107
01:01:45,552 --> 01:01:47,429
You don't work here, beat it.

1108
01:01:50,598 --> 01:01:52,767
- I told you to let
me do the talking.

1109
01:01:53,101 --> 01:01:53,727
- But I--

1110
01:01:54,060 --> 01:01:54,769
- Are you two still here?

1111
01:01:56,438 --> 01:01:59,691
- I think you misunderstood,
what she meant to say is

1112
01:02:00,025 --> 01:02:03,278
we're here to get to work
delivering a stripping telegram.

1113
01:02:04,571 --> 01:02:07,240
- Oh, well that's
different, come on in.

1114
01:02:07,574 --> 01:02:08,116
- Thank you.

1115
01:02:09,868 --> 01:02:12,370
- The things a girl's
gotta do to make a living.

1116
01:02:29,137 --> 01:02:30,180
- Check this place out.

1117
01:02:30,513 --> 01:02:33,183
Where do you think
her hideout could be?

1118
01:02:35,435 --> 01:02:36,227
(feedback ringing)

1119
01:02:36,561 --> 01:02:39,439
- And now, a special treat.

1120
01:02:39,773 --> 01:02:42,567
Tonight only, two new
broads are gonna do

1121
01:02:42,901 --> 01:02:46,446
a special strip tease
just for you guys.

1122
01:02:48,490 --> 01:02:51,576
(club goers cheering)

1123
01:02:53,161 --> 01:02:54,579
- What do we do now?

1124
01:02:56,247 --> 01:02:57,332
- I'm not backing
out of this one.

1125
01:02:57,665 --> 01:02:58,833
I don't know about
you but I'm prepared

1126
01:02:59,167 --> 01:03:01,294
to go all the way if necessary.

1127
01:03:01,628 --> 01:03:04,964
- Ha, you probably don't even
know how to shake your pelvis.

1128
01:03:07,842 --> 01:03:08,635
(record scratching)

1129
01:03:08,968 --> 01:03:13,723
(upbeat music)
(crowd cheering)

1130
01:05:11,382 --> 01:05:15,512
- Two grasshoppers, two
beers, and a Singapore Sling.

1131
01:05:26,606 --> 01:05:29,359
(glasses clanking)

1132
01:05:36,908 --> 01:05:37,575
(loud smacking)

1133
01:05:37,909 --> 01:05:39,077
- What the hell is this?

1134
01:05:39,410 --> 01:05:41,621
- Yeah I thought
our show was next.

1135
01:05:41,955 --> 01:05:42,497
- In a minute.

1136
01:05:47,835 --> 01:05:49,128
- We can do a lot
better than those two.

1137
01:05:49,462 --> 01:05:50,713
- I'll say.

1138
01:05:51,047 --> 01:05:52,674
- Yeah, well you got to admit,

1139
01:05:53,007 --> 01:05:54,759
they dance pretty good for cops.

1140
01:05:56,344 --> 01:05:58,513
(laughing)

1141
01:06:40,888 --> 01:06:42,682
- [Crowd] More, more!

1142
01:06:44,434 --> 01:06:45,101
More more!

1143
01:06:49,397 --> 01:06:50,064
More!

1144
01:06:51,566 --> 01:06:52,442
Take it off!

1145
01:06:53,359 --> 01:06:55,945
(crowd cheering)

1146
01:07:15,757 --> 01:07:17,592
(gasping)

1147
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:30,647
- Let me through.

1148
01:07:30,980 --> 01:07:32,148
Get out of my way.

1149
01:07:32,482 --> 01:07:35,735
Young man, put your
eyes back in your head.

1150
01:07:37,820 --> 01:07:39,822
Girls get off that stage.

1151
01:07:48,706 --> 01:07:49,374
Ugh!

1152
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:54,754
Honestly, can't you two
ever keep your clothes on?

1153
01:07:55,088 --> 01:07:57,840
- Well the whole
thing was Didi's idea.

1154
01:07:58,174 --> 01:08:00,593
- Ms. Devonshire, what
are you doing here?

1155
01:08:00,927 --> 01:08:04,764
- Who do you think got the job
as a bookkeeper, you idiots?

1156
01:08:05,098 --> 01:08:06,641
(gun cocking)

1157
01:08:06,974 --> 01:08:09,519
- Welly, well, well,
look what we have here.

1158
01:08:09,852 --> 01:08:12,438
Not two cops but three.

1159
01:08:12,772 --> 01:08:15,942
- You're making a big
mistake, I'm a bookkeeper.

1160
01:08:16,275 --> 01:08:18,319
And I was just telling
these girls how much

1161
01:08:18,653 --> 01:08:21,572
I was disgusted by their show.

1162
01:08:21,906 --> 01:08:24,158
- Yeah, and we
really are strippers.

1163
01:08:24,492 --> 01:08:27,286
- Save it, we got a metal
detector at the door.

1164
01:08:27,620 --> 01:08:29,288
It went ape shit when you
two walked through it.

1165
01:08:29,622 --> 01:08:33,251
You're packing enough
hardware, you got to be cops.

1166
01:08:33,584 --> 01:08:35,169
- No, you've got it all wrong.

1167
01:08:35,503 --> 01:08:39,674
It's just our cheap, our cheap
jewelry, that set it off.

1168
01:08:40,007 --> 01:08:40,717
(metal clinking)

1169
01:08:41,050 --> 01:08:43,553
- Aphrodisia, Felatia,
get me their purses.

1170
01:08:47,390 --> 01:08:48,641
Go ahead, look inside it.

1171
01:08:52,812 --> 01:08:54,313
Just as I thought.

1172
01:08:54,647 --> 01:08:55,440
All right, get going.

1173
01:08:56,441 --> 01:08:58,985
(dramatic music)

1174
01:09:07,243 --> 01:09:10,538
- Looks like you three won't
be anymore trouble tonight.

1175
01:09:10,872 --> 01:09:12,749
- Yeah and I can
dance better than you

1176
01:09:13,082 --> 01:09:15,710
with both feet tied
behind my back.

1177
01:09:21,048 --> 01:09:22,759
- And might I just
add that you look

1178
01:09:23,092 --> 01:09:25,678
flattering with these
ropes around you.

1179
01:09:26,012 --> 01:09:27,138
When you work in
a place like this,

1180
01:09:27,472 --> 01:09:30,224
it's women like you
that really turn me on.

1181
01:09:31,225 --> 01:09:33,019
- Shoot me if you must, but for

1182
01:09:33,352 --> 01:09:36,481
God's sake keep
your hands off me.

1183
01:09:36,814 --> 01:09:37,815
(alarm blaring)

1184
01:09:38,149 --> 01:09:39,734
- Well looks like somebody
else is packing some hardware.

1185
01:09:40,067 --> 01:09:40,568
Check it out, girls.

1186
01:09:40,902 --> 01:09:41,819
- You got it.

1187
01:09:42,153 --> 01:09:43,905
(alarm blaring)

1188
01:09:44,238 --> 01:09:48,993
(upbeat music)
(crowd cheering)

1189
01:09:59,545 --> 01:10:00,671
- Can we help you?

1190
01:10:01,005 --> 01:10:03,299
- Yeah, I'm looking for
some babes here tonight.

1191
01:10:03,633 --> 01:10:04,926
You two look like
you can satisfy me

1192
01:10:05,259 --> 01:10:06,469
for about the first hour or so.

1193
01:10:06,803 --> 01:10:08,596
- Oh really?

1194
01:10:08,930 --> 01:10:10,890
- Yeah, then you can
send in the second shift.

1195
01:10:12,642 --> 01:10:13,810
After you two catch your breath,

1196
01:10:14,143 --> 01:10:15,686
maybe I'll let you
come back for seconds.

1197
01:10:16,020 --> 01:10:17,355
- Oh lucky us.

1198
01:10:18,689 --> 01:10:21,484
- I can hardly wait to
get my hands on you.

1199
01:10:21,818 --> 01:10:22,777
- Me either.

1200
01:10:23,110 --> 01:10:24,070
- Girls, girls, come
on, there's plenty

1201
01:10:24,403 --> 01:10:25,863
of me to go around right.

1202
01:10:26,197 --> 01:10:28,032
(chuckles)

1203
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:31,828
Hey, yeah.

1204
01:10:33,746 --> 01:10:34,914
- I just can't help myself.

1205
01:10:35,248 --> 01:10:36,833
- [Felatia] Oh let me at him.

1206
01:10:37,166 --> 01:10:38,918
- Hey take it easy girls, huh.

1207
01:10:40,336 --> 01:10:41,796
- Don't move, asshole.

1208
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:44,423
- How did you know I had a gun?

1209
01:10:44,757 --> 01:10:47,510
- I took one look at you
the minute you came in.

1210
01:10:47,844 --> 01:10:51,597
No one can be that
happy to see us.

1211
01:10:51,931 --> 01:10:52,932
- Come on, let's go.

1212
01:10:53,266 --> 01:10:56,102
(Petrolino groaning)

1213
01:10:58,479 --> 01:10:59,897
- Oh great.

1214
01:11:00,231 --> 01:11:02,733
- Yeah and we're gonna
tie this one up the back.

1215
01:11:03,067 --> 01:11:05,403
- And if he's anything
like he says he is,

1216
01:11:05,736 --> 01:11:08,823
Spanish Fly is gonna want
this one for herself.

1217
01:11:09,156 --> 01:11:11,617
(girls laughing)

1218
01:11:14,078 --> 01:11:16,956
(suspenseful music)

1219
01:11:18,749 --> 01:11:21,878
- Okay, now get undressed.

1220
01:11:27,592 --> 01:11:30,678
(ominous synth music)

1221
01:11:31,637 --> 01:11:34,223
- So look at what we have here.

1222
01:11:36,392 --> 01:11:40,938
Ooh Devonshire, so
we meet face to face.

1223
01:11:41,272 --> 01:11:45,943
So what have you got
to say now, hmm, huh?

1224
01:11:46,277 --> 01:11:49,155
- It's not over
yet, Spanish Fly.

1225
01:11:49,488 --> 01:11:54,035
- Ha, big words
from a small mind.

1226
01:11:54,368 --> 01:11:57,413
(Spanish Fly laughing)

1227
01:11:59,540 --> 01:12:00,583
- We've got another one for you

1228
01:12:00,917 --> 01:12:02,877
in the playroom, Spanish Fly.

1229
01:12:03,210 --> 01:12:05,880
- Yeah, and I think
you'll like this one.

1230
01:12:06,213 --> 01:12:09,508
- Oh good, it'll give me
something to do later.

1231
01:12:11,010 --> 01:12:13,888
Yes, I have plans for
you three right now.

1232
01:12:14,221 --> 01:12:16,766
Horace, bring me
my special formula.

1233
01:12:17,099 --> 01:12:18,184
- Yes, boss.

1234
01:12:18,517 --> 01:12:22,772
(Spanish Fly laughing
and squealing)

1235
01:12:26,233 --> 01:12:27,652
(liquid bubbling)

1236
01:12:27,985 --> 01:12:31,405
- Oh, here it is, Spanish Fly
in it's pure undiluted form.

1237
01:12:34,116 --> 01:12:38,996
One close is fatal, it'll kill
you through your own libido.

1238
01:12:40,039 --> 01:12:40,873
(liquid bubbling)

1239
01:12:41,207 --> 01:12:44,001
Yes, I do think I'm
ready to see it work.

1240
01:12:45,419 --> 01:12:47,546
Who wants to die from ecstasy?

1241
01:12:47,880 --> 01:12:50,174
How about you, girlie?

1242
01:12:50,508 --> 01:12:51,676
- No thanks, maybe later.

1243
01:12:52,009 --> 01:12:53,719
- [Spanish Fly] Oh
shut up, just get

1244
01:12:54,053 --> 01:12:55,763
ready for your taste
of Spanish Fly.

1245
01:12:58,265 --> 01:12:59,892
(whimsical music)

1246
01:13:00,226 --> 01:13:02,019
- It's been nice
knowing you, Didi.

1247
01:13:02,353 --> 01:13:03,938
(seductive music)

1248
01:13:04,271 --> 01:13:07,108
(Didi breathing heavy)

1249
01:13:07,441 --> 01:13:11,028
(Didi groaning and yelling)

1250
01:13:26,210 --> 01:13:30,006
- Oh, it should be
over any minute now.

1251
01:13:30,339 --> 01:13:31,298
- Somebody got a cigarette?

1252
01:13:33,843 --> 01:13:36,512
- It didn't work,
that's impossible.

1253
01:13:36,846 --> 01:13:40,016
- Can I have some more please,
I'm coming off it fast.

1254
01:13:40,349 --> 01:13:42,893
- You made a big mistake
picking her, Spanish Fly.

1255
01:13:43,227 --> 01:13:44,979
Her sex drive is so high that

1256
01:13:45,312 --> 01:13:47,815
your drug has no effect on her.

1257
01:13:48,149 --> 01:13:50,526
- Now we'll see when
I increase the dosage.

1258
01:13:51,819 --> 01:13:54,071
(alarm blaring)

1259
01:13:54,405 --> 01:13:55,406
What is that?

1260
01:13:55,740 --> 01:13:57,033
- Sounds like a hardware store.

1261
01:13:57,366 --> 01:14:02,038
- All right Spanish Fly, get
ready to meet your maker.

1262
01:14:04,040 --> 01:14:06,834
- What is Frederick's
of Hollywood here?

1263
01:14:10,838 --> 01:14:11,422
(gun cocking)

1264
01:14:11,756 --> 01:14:12,965
- What is that?

1265
01:14:13,299 --> 01:14:17,344
- Meet BimboCop, the newest
addition to our force.

1266
01:14:17,678 --> 01:14:21,098
Go ahead Spanish
Fly, it's your move.

1267
01:14:22,224 --> 01:14:24,769
- Jesus, is that
thing dangerous?

1268
01:14:25,102 --> 01:14:28,022
- Sorry I'm late, I was
going to come in the front

1269
01:14:28,355 --> 01:14:30,566
but I wanted to be
less conspicuous.

1270
01:14:30,900 --> 01:14:32,234
- What's wrong with her?

1271
01:14:32,568 --> 01:14:34,278
- I'm here to get to work,

1272
01:14:34,612 --> 01:14:37,114
don't you still have
a job here for me?

1273
01:14:38,741 --> 01:14:42,453
Wait a minute, I think
I said that backwards.

1274
01:14:43,954 --> 01:14:45,039
I know on second
thought, why don't I just

1275
01:14:45,372 --> 01:14:49,919
leave and come back
in a second time.

1276
01:14:50,252 --> 01:14:55,007
- So Devonshire, this is what
you've threatened me with?

1277
01:14:56,217 --> 01:14:58,260
- She has you fooled.

1278
01:14:59,637 --> 01:15:02,348
- Do you think you could
come over here and sit down?

1279
01:15:06,185 --> 01:15:08,312
There you go, there you
go, please sit down.

1280
01:15:11,357 --> 01:15:16,237
(Spanish Fly singing)
(dramatic music)

1281
01:15:20,074 --> 01:15:22,284
Oh there we go, comfy, yes?

1282
01:15:27,498 --> 01:15:30,459
To think my hard earned
tax paying dollars

1283
01:15:30,793 --> 01:15:34,046
went to build this pile of junk.

1284
01:15:34,380 --> 01:15:36,048
- Spanish Fly,
don't forget what's

1285
01:15:36,382 --> 01:15:38,092
waiting for you in the playroom.

1286
01:15:38,425 --> 01:15:41,846
- Yeah and his badge says his
codename is Big Night Stick.

1287
01:15:42,179 --> 01:15:43,055
(girls laughing)

1288
01:15:43,389 --> 01:15:45,724
- Oh thank you.

1289
01:15:46,058 --> 01:15:48,978
Well I'll just see if he
can live up to his name.

1290
01:15:50,354 --> 01:15:52,189
Oh fuck, will you
get back to work.

1291
01:15:52,523 --> 01:15:55,568
Look this group isn't going
anywhere, come on, Jesus.

1292
01:16:00,197 --> 01:16:03,325
(dramatic organ music)

1293
01:16:10,457 --> 01:16:12,543
So, what have we got here?

1294
01:16:14,795 --> 01:16:16,380
- I feel naked without my badge.

1295
01:16:17,715 --> 01:16:20,759
- Oh baby, my girls
really do have

1296
01:16:21,093 --> 01:16:23,262
good taste, they
know what I like.

1297
01:16:23,596 --> 01:16:24,346
- What are you doing?

1298
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:25,973
Stop that.

1299
01:16:26,307 --> 01:16:29,476
- Oh honey even you should be
able to figure that one out.

1300
01:16:31,187 --> 01:16:32,104
Oh come on, I can't wait any
longer, get it up, come on.

1301
01:16:35,316 --> 01:16:38,152
I can't wait any longer,
come on, get it up.

1302
01:16:38,485 --> 01:16:39,987
(girls laughing)

1303
01:16:40,321 --> 01:16:41,530
Big Night Stick, boy it looks

1304
01:16:41,864 --> 01:16:44,200
more like a little
cocktail weenie to me.

1305
01:16:44,533 --> 01:16:45,576
(girls laughing)

1306
01:16:45,910 --> 01:16:47,953
- I don't understand it,
this afternoon that robot

1307
01:16:48,287 --> 01:16:50,289
was in perfect
working condition.

1308
01:16:50,623 --> 01:16:52,499
Now it's acting
just like you two.

1309
01:16:52,833 --> 01:16:55,252
What would make it so
worthless all of a sudden?

1310
01:16:56,795 --> 01:16:59,089
- Look, someone's
altered her control belt.

1311
01:16:59,423 --> 01:17:02,009
(belt beeping)

1312
01:17:02,343 --> 01:17:03,928
- She's right, it's
been set on worthless.

1313
01:17:04,261 --> 01:17:05,221
- What?

1314
01:17:05,554 --> 01:17:06,639
- Let me see if I can fix it.

1315
01:17:09,308 --> 01:17:11,894
(belt beeping)

1316
01:17:15,105 --> 01:17:19,985
(metal creaking)
(dramatic music)

1317
01:17:26,242 --> 01:17:28,285
Attagirl, BimboCop.

1318
01:17:28,619 --> 01:17:29,161
- Get 'em.

1319
01:17:32,915 --> 01:17:36,126
- So then the guy says, "No,
the drink is for my duck."

1320
01:17:36,460 --> 01:17:38,796
(both laughing)

1321
01:17:40,381 --> 01:17:43,300
- Oh it's only that lame robot.

1322
01:17:43,634 --> 01:17:44,927
(both laughing)

1323
01:17:45,261 --> 01:17:47,721
(metal creaking)

1324
01:17:56,605 --> 01:17:58,107
Dammit, what happened?

1325
01:17:58,440 --> 01:18:00,526
- I don't know but that robot's
sure upset about something.

1326
01:18:01,777 --> 01:18:04,363
(dramatic music)

1327
01:18:06,615 --> 01:18:07,241
(gun cocking)

1328
01:18:07,574 --> 01:18:08,450
- What's the joke?

1329
01:18:11,036 --> 01:18:13,580
(metal creaking)

1330
01:18:16,083 --> 01:18:18,919
- Here's the joke, get
ready for a big bust.

1331
01:18:20,087 --> 01:18:22,756
(Horace groaning)

1332
01:18:25,509 --> 01:18:29,763
(metal creaking)
(Horace groaning)

1333
01:18:30,097 --> 01:18:30,681
What are you waiting for?

1334
01:18:31,015 --> 01:18:31,765
Got get 'em.

1335
01:18:33,392 --> 01:18:35,102
- Come on, get it up!

1336
01:18:35,436 --> 01:18:37,980
- Spanish Fly,
run, the jig is up.

1337
01:18:38,897 --> 01:18:42,109
(dramatic organ music)

1338
01:18:42,443 --> 01:18:44,903
(metal creaking)

1339
01:18:47,948 --> 01:18:50,951
(Spanish Fly yelling)

1340
01:18:51,285 --> 01:18:52,828
She's right behind us.

1341
01:18:59,335 --> 01:19:01,587
(both yelling)

1342
01:19:03,297 --> 01:19:04,923
(bodies thudding)

1343
01:19:05,257 --> 01:19:07,676
(sirens blaring)

1344
01:19:25,444 --> 01:19:28,238
- Oh, don't hurt
me, don't hurt me.

1345
01:19:34,119 --> 01:19:35,120
(body thudding)

1346
01:19:35,454 --> 01:19:36,497
- [Man] Come on, you're
blocking my radar.

1347
01:19:37,581 --> 01:19:41,126
- I want you to tell
your friends about me.

1348
01:19:41,460 --> 01:19:43,587
(grand music)

1349
01:19:51,553 --> 01:19:56,475
- When will you insects ever
learn that crime doesn't pay.

1350
01:19:59,645 --> 01:20:04,525
(metal creaking)
(radio chattering)

1351
01:20:17,496 --> 01:20:20,290
(sirens blaring)

1352
01:20:32,553 --> 01:20:33,345
(ominous music)

1353
01:20:33,679 --> 01:20:36,265
- Hey, somebody
help me, let me go.

1354
01:20:40,436 --> 01:20:42,980
(girls laughing)

1355
01:20:49,653 --> 01:20:50,779
(girls laughing)

1356
01:20:51,113 --> 01:20:52,573
Good, I'm glad you two are here.

1357
01:20:53,782 --> 01:20:54,908
Unchain me, all right?

1358
01:20:55,242 --> 01:20:57,786
- What have we here?

1359
01:20:58,120 --> 01:21:00,372
- It looks like a turkey
all stretched out.

1360
01:21:00,706 --> 01:21:01,623
- It's not funny.

1361
01:21:03,417 --> 01:21:07,379
- Poor Petrolino, all tied
up in a room with two babes

1362
01:21:07,713 --> 01:21:09,965
who can't get enough
of his hot body.

1363
01:21:11,633 --> 01:21:12,759
- The things you see when
you don't have a camera.

1364
01:21:13,093 --> 01:21:15,387
- Hey come on, just
get me down okay.

1365
01:21:15,721 --> 01:21:17,264
- If we let you go are
you gonna take back

1366
01:21:17,598 --> 01:21:18,849
your request to have us fired?

1367
01:21:19,766 --> 01:21:21,185
- What?

1368
01:21:21,518 --> 01:21:24,104
- You know I think I do
have a camera in my purse.

1369
01:21:24,438 --> 01:21:25,772
- [Didi] Really.

1370
01:21:26,106 --> 01:21:27,774
- All right, all
right, all right,

1371
01:21:28,108 --> 01:21:29,776
I'll take back my request.

1372
01:21:30,110 --> 01:21:30,861
- So now do you think that women

1373
01:21:31,195 --> 01:21:32,488
can be as good a cop as men?

1374
01:21:34,406 --> 01:21:37,075
- Yes, just get me down
off of this, all right?

1375
01:21:39,328 --> 01:21:41,288
(girls laughing)

1376
01:21:41,622 --> 01:21:46,376
Ah.

1377
01:21:49,755 --> 01:21:53,050
- Wait 'til the guys at
work hear about this one.

1378
01:21:53,383 --> 01:21:55,802
(dramatic music)

1379
01:22:00,849 --> 01:22:02,226
- Whoa, whoa, ah!

1380
01:22:03,685 --> 01:22:06,563
(upbeat music)

1381
01:22:06,897 --> 01:22:09,483
- Girls, today I
can stand proud.

1382
01:22:09,816 --> 01:22:13,111
Spanish Fly is behind
bars, the request to get

1383
01:22:13,445 --> 01:22:15,614
you fired has been
lifted, and we're about

1384
01:22:15,948 --> 01:22:18,825
to be honored at
an awards ceremony.

1385
01:22:19,159 --> 01:22:20,994
I wonder how long this can last?

1386
01:22:21,328 --> 01:22:24,831
- Ms. Devonshire, how much time
before the ceremony starts?

1387
01:22:25,165 --> 01:22:26,875
- About 15 minutes, why?

1388
01:22:27,209 --> 01:22:28,126
- I'll be right back.

1389
01:22:29,336 --> 01:22:30,003
- Me too.

1390
01:22:36,843 --> 01:22:40,389
- First she tied up
Petrolino so he was helpless,

1391
01:22:40,722 --> 01:22:42,766
then he couldn't
get it up and she

1392
01:22:43,100 --> 01:22:45,519
was really getting
upset with him.

1393
01:22:45,852 --> 01:22:46,895
- Really?

1394
01:22:47,229 --> 01:22:51,275
- Oh yeah, and you should've
seen what she looked like.

1395
01:22:51,608 --> 01:22:53,151
- Come on get to the good part.

1396
01:22:53,485 --> 01:22:56,446
- Well after he disappointed
her, Holly and I

1397
01:22:56,780 --> 01:22:59,116
had to come in and let him go.

1398
01:22:59,449 --> 01:23:01,994
And you should've seen
him, sniveling like a baby.

1399
01:23:02,327 --> 01:23:04,538
(all laughing)

1400
01:23:05,831 --> 01:23:08,125
- Petrolino, there goes
your reputation now.

1401
01:23:08,458 --> 01:23:09,543
(laughs)

1402
01:23:09,876 --> 01:23:11,253
(quirky music)

1403
01:23:11,587 --> 01:23:12,421
- Yeah right.

1404
01:23:19,386 --> 01:23:20,470
- Are you busy, sir?

1405
01:23:20,804 --> 01:23:23,765
- Hmm, oh no, no, not
at all, not at all,

1406
01:23:24,099 --> 01:23:25,726
come right in, what
can I do for you Hol?

1407
01:23:27,352 --> 01:23:29,855
- Well, since I was the one
who was most responsible

1408
01:23:30,188 --> 01:23:33,692
for capturing Spanish Fly, I
was just wondering if there

1409
01:23:34,026 --> 01:23:36,653
was some sort of an award being
given at today's ceremony.

1410
01:23:37,904 --> 01:23:40,324
- You know as a matter
of fact there is.

1411
01:23:40,657 --> 01:23:41,825
I'm gonna be honoring the best

1412
01:23:42,159 --> 01:23:45,037
new addition to the force, hmm.

1413
01:23:45,370 --> 01:23:47,539
- Good, I just hope
that you're fully aware

1414
01:23:47,873 --> 01:23:49,541
of my contribution to the case.

1415
01:23:49,875 --> 01:23:51,543
I mean getting an
award like this

1416
01:23:51,877 --> 01:23:53,670
would make me look very
good in my father's eyes.

1417
01:23:54,004 --> 01:23:55,672
- Oh I'm sure,
I'm sure it would.

1418
01:23:56,006 --> 01:23:58,175
But you know actually
Holly, you're not

1419
01:23:58,508 --> 01:24:00,719
the one I was thinking of
giving that award to dear.

1420
01:24:01,053 --> 01:24:02,220
- What?

1421
01:24:02,554 --> 01:24:04,931
- Well from what I
understand BimboCop

1422
01:24:05,265 --> 01:24:06,433
was the one that did
most of the work.

1423
01:24:06,767 --> 01:24:08,060
Now, BimboCop should be the one

1424
01:24:08,393 --> 01:24:10,312
that gets credit for
capturing Spanish Fly.

1425
01:24:11,688 --> 01:24:14,816
- That robot, you
can't be serious.

1426
01:24:15,150 --> 01:24:15,609
- I can't?

1427
01:24:15,942 --> 01:24:17,694
Well sure I can.

1428
01:24:18,028 --> 01:24:18,695
- Well try and reconsider.

1429
01:24:19,029 --> 01:24:20,697
When BimboCop showed
up at the club

1430
01:24:21,031 --> 01:24:22,908
she was the easiest
one to capture.

1431
01:24:23,241 --> 01:24:25,702
- Oh now, now, now, that was
merely a clever rouse, dear.

1432
01:24:26,036 --> 01:24:29,289
Uh, if you'll excuse me,
it's time for that ceremony.

1433
01:24:29,623 --> 01:24:30,999
Come on, you don't
want to miss it.

1434
01:24:32,668 --> 01:24:34,044
- Yeah right.

1435
01:24:34,378 --> 01:24:34,961
(dramatic music)

1436
01:24:35,295 --> 01:24:35,712
- [Lady On Phone] Your advisor.

1437
01:24:41,259 --> 01:24:44,054
(radio chattering)

1438
01:24:45,847 --> 01:24:47,808
- BimboCop, this
is gonna hurt you

1439
01:24:48,141 --> 01:24:49,935
a lot more than
it's gonna hurt me.

1440
01:24:50,268 --> 01:24:52,771
(belt beeping)

1441
01:24:58,193 --> 01:25:00,779
All set, see you at the awards.

1442
01:25:01,113 --> 01:25:04,074
(electronic crashing)

1443
01:25:21,842 --> 01:25:24,219
(upbeat music)

1444
01:25:27,764 --> 01:25:31,226
- Testing, test,
testing one, two, three.

1445
01:25:31,560 --> 01:25:35,689
Now, welcome and
greetings to our assembly.

1446
01:25:36,022 --> 01:25:38,608
I'm sure you all know
by now that Spanish Fly

1447
01:25:38,942 --> 01:25:42,863
and her cohorts were successfully
captured last night.

1448
01:25:43,196 --> 01:25:45,949
(audience clapping)

1449
01:25:47,617 --> 01:25:49,745
Now may I present to you,
the one most responsible

1450
01:25:50,078 --> 01:25:52,122
for bringing in Spanish Fly.

1451
01:25:53,874 --> 01:25:56,460
(audience murmuring)

1452
01:25:56,793 --> 01:25:58,920
Let's all give a
round of applause

1453
01:25:59,254 --> 01:26:02,466
to the finest new cop
on the force, BimboCop.

1454
01:26:04,468 --> 01:26:09,347
(audience clapping)
(meatal creaking)

1455
01:26:12,934 --> 01:26:15,896
- I want to thank you
all for your applause.

1456
01:26:16,229 --> 01:26:19,399
Capturing Spanish Fly
was my first mission

1457
01:26:19,733 --> 01:26:22,277
and I'm proud it went so well.

1458
01:26:22,611 --> 01:26:24,571
But most of all I
want to say this.

1459
01:26:24,905 --> 01:26:29,659
(steam blowing)
(dramatic music)

1460
01:26:31,745 --> 01:26:35,665
(explosion booming)
(audience screaming)

1461
01:26:35,999 --> 01:26:40,754
(dramatic music)
(audience murmuring)

1462
01:26:42,881 --> 01:26:43,548
- She's gone.

1463
01:26:44,508 --> 01:26:46,426
- It's all right, sir.

1464
01:26:47,636 --> 01:26:48,970
- Well, will I ever find another

1465
01:26:49,304 --> 01:26:51,014
woman who can fill her shoes?

1466
01:26:56,645 --> 01:26:58,730
- Well now that that's
over with, why don't we

1467
01:26:59,064 --> 01:27:01,316
get on with the awards ceremony.

1468
01:27:01,650 --> 01:27:02,984
Surely there must
be another officer

1469
01:27:03,318 --> 01:27:05,111
who's worthy of the award.

1470
01:27:05,445 --> 01:27:07,823
I mean there were several
of us on the case.

1471
01:27:09,032 --> 01:27:11,243
- I suppose you're right, Holly.

1472
01:27:11,576 --> 01:27:14,287
- I was the one that got
us into the club so easily.

1473
01:27:14,621 --> 01:27:16,456
- Actually I did that one.

1474
01:27:16,790 --> 01:27:18,708
- Girls, not now.

1475
01:27:19,042 --> 01:27:20,126
- And I was the one
that took charge

1476
01:27:20,460 --> 01:27:22,587
during the interview when
we went there to get jobs.

1477
01:27:22,921 --> 01:27:24,506
- Yeah but we didn't
get those jobs.

1478
01:27:24,840 --> 01:27:26,299
- Stop nitpicking,
Didi, it's clear

1479
01:27:26,633 --> 01:27:28,009
to see who deserves the award.

1480
01:27:31,805 --> 01:27:33,598
- Myron, what are
you doing back there?

1481
01:27:35,058 --> 01:27:38,562
- The access control box, I
think someone sabotaged her.

1482
01:27:38,895 --> 01:27:40,146
- You're sure?

1483
01:27:40,480 --> 01:27:42,524
- Why don't we worry
about this later?

1484
01:27:42,858 --> 01:27:44,651
- No, no, no, no, no,
there's some dirty work

1485
01:27:44,985 --> 01:27:46,444
afoot, I want to know about it.

1486
01:27:46,778 --> 01:27:51,366
- Just as I thought, someone's
tampered with her box.

1487
01:27:56,663 --> 01:27:58,707
- Hey, it wasn't me.

1488
01:27:59,040 --> 01:28:01,877
- Don't worry, the robot
had a built in memory.

1489
01:28:02,210 --> 01:28:04,296
It'll show us the last
person to sabotage her.

1490
01:28:04,629 --> 01:28:05,088
(dramatic music)

1491
01:28:05,422 --> 01:28:07,799
(box beeping)

1492
01:28:19,019 --> 01:28:20,979
(audience booing)

1493
01:28:21,313 --> 01:28:25,066
- Well, Didi I suppose
you earned this.

1494
01:28:26,359 --> 01:28:27,736
Come on, come on.

1495
01:28:29,613 --> 01:28:31,281
- Thank you sir,
but I would like

1496
01:28:31,615 --> 01:28:32,866
to share the honor of this award

1497
01:28:33,199 --> 01:28:35,994
with my partner, who's efforts
should not go unrewarded.

1498
01:28:37,704 --> 01:28:41,458
Because if it wasn't for her,
I wouldn't be here right now.

1499
01:28:41,791 --> 01:28:43,460
Let's hear it for BimboCop.

1500
01:28:44,628 --> 01:28:47,172
(dramatic music)

1501
01:28:51,009 --> 01:28:52,552
- Thank you everyone.

1502
01:28:54,554 --> 01:28:56,890
(upbeat music)

1503
01:29:02,938 --> 01:29:05,357
- Well, Ms. Devonshire,
I hope that you're proud

1504
01:29:05,690 --> 01:29:08,443
that one of your former
students received that award.

1505
01:29:08,777 --> 01:29:12,781
- Yes, I suppose Didi is the
one who deserved it the most.

1506
01:29:13,114 --> 01:29:14,032
- Mm-hmm.

1507
01:29:14,366 --> 01:29:17,035
- By the way, what happened
to the water cooler?

1508
01:29:17,369 --> 01:29:18,203
(dramatic music)

1509
01:29:18,536 --> 01:29:22,248
- John, it's Didi, I'll
be home in 10 minutes,

1510
01:29:22,582 --> 01:29:24,292
and I hope you're thirsty.

1511
01:29:27,629 --> 01:29:29,881
- And my last cell
mate, she wasn't

1512
01:29:30,215 --> 01:29:31,007
as pretty as you.

1513
01:29:31,341 --> 01:29:32,592
(laughs)

1514
01:29:32,926 --> 01:29:36,972
That's why I had
to strangle her.

1515
01:29:37,305 --> 01:29:40,934
Of course it wasn't my fault,
she kept telling me no.

1516
01:29:44,062 --> 01:29:44,938
- Excuse me.

1517
01:29:50,694 --> 01:29:53,571
Guard, I think there's
been a mistake!

1518
01:29:53,905 --> 01:29:56,658
Guard, can somebody
get me the warden!

1519
01:29:56,992 --> 01:29:59,119
- 10 p.m., lights out, ladies!

1520
01:30:00,286 --> 01:30:01,663
(Holly screaming)

1521
01:30:01,997 --> 01:30:06,751
(explosion booming)
(upbeat jazzy music)

1522
01:30:09,045 --> 01:30:11,131
(moaning)

1523
01:30:34,112 --> 01:30:36,031
(grunting)

1524
01:31:07,353 --> 01:31:09,522
(jazz music)

1525
01:31:40,136 --> 01:31:43,306
(festive carnival music)

1526
01:31:57,237 --> 01:32:00,115
(upbeat synth music)

1527
01:32:31,938 --> 01:32:36,938
(funky music)
