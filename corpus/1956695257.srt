Melissa credit for one thing.

360

She used to be the prettiest girl in town.

Used to be?

00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:46,383

I sent birthday cards

- I never got them!

that it made things big,

that's the exoskeleton.

Crab shells don't grow,

1125

so every few years they shed the old shell

1126
00:54:21,060 --> 00:54:22,010
and grow a new one.

1127
