MATT: So I remind you
of that guy, Everyman?

2
00:01:57,909 --> 00:02:02,038
You put me in mind of him, Matt.
I don't know that you remind me.

3
00:02:02,747 --> 00:02:04,999
You're not a good guy.

4
00:02:05,082 --> 00:02:07,335
You sit around all day,
you do nothing with your life,

5
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:09,170
living off God knows what.

6
00:02:09,253 --> 00:02:14,759
You gamble, you're divorced,
a dark past before I met you.

7
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,969
Then you're a cop
and they kicked you out.

8
00:02:17,052 --> 00:02:18,262
I bet you don't see your
daughter one day out of 20.

9
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:19,722
Dad.

10
00:02:49,209 --> 00:02:51,211
You're right.

11
00:02:52,629 --> 00:02:54,882
You're right about that.

12
00:02:54,965 --> 00:02:56,842
I'm a bad man.

13
00:02:56,884 --> 00:02:58,510
What I say bothers you?

14
00:02:58,552 --> 00:03:01,054
You know that I know that
everybody knows you took the money,

15
00:03:01,138 --> 00:03:03,182
even though they
couldn't prove it.

16
00:03:03,265 --> 00:03:06,685
Maybe someday you'll cough
it up. Maybe you won't.

17
00:03:08,103 --> 00:03:10,397
The world is filled
with guys like you.

18
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,858
Guys worried about getting
what they think they deserve,

19
00:03:12,941 --> 00:03:15,861
and why should
they work for it?

20
00:03:15,902 --> 00:03:19,614
But deep inside you,
you've got this...

21
00:03:19,698 --> 00:03:23,076
I don't know, this spark,
this seed of decency.

22
00:03:27,247 --> 00:03:29,499
I have to go.
Somebody I got to see.

23
00:03:36,548 --> 00:03:38,383
Hey, Matt.

24
00:03:38,425 --> 00:03:42,804
Any time you want,
you come around, okay?

25
00:03:42,888 --> 00:03:44,890
Now, you see, that's
what I like about you.

26
00:03:44,931 --> 00:03:46,558
What's that?

27
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,894
A good guy like you got time
for such a bad guy like me.

28
00:03:49,978 --> 00:03:51,855
Ain't that something.

Four to you.

Okay, flip.

Yes.

This one is...

00:05:51,223 --> 00:05:52,683
I could lose my shirt.

42

That's 20 to you, Matt.

That's okay,
it's fine. Fine.

No, that's not okay. House
rules. No debts at our tables.

No, it is fine, it is fine.

away, don't worry about it.

Sure.

to approach you on his behalf.

Really? Who might that be?

78

Okay, all right.

00:09:09,336 --> 00:09:10,337
Get down.

Hey, no need for that, Matt.

83
00:09:16,051 --> 00:09:17,427

How about if I just shoot him
in the fucking head?

88
00:09:28,772 --> 00:09:33,443
Then we got a problem, 'cause
I don't give a shit if you do.

00:09:33,527 --> 00:09:35,404

what you want, man?

00:09:38,031 --> 00:09:39,741
I'm the messenger.

Make a right, first aisle.

92
00:10:08,019 --> 00:10:10,271
Mr. Conner, I won't
thank you for coming

93
00:10:10,355 --> 00:10:12,691
because, let's face it,
you were forced to come.

94
00:10:12,774 --> 00:10:15,360
I'm sure that doesn't
sit well with you.

95
00:10:15,443 --> 00:10:17,779
Well, thank you for
the consideration.

96
00:10:17,862 --> 00:10:19,364
What do I call you?

97
00:10:19,447 --> 00:10:20,407
You don't.

98
00:10:22,784 --> 00:10:25,453
You know, you should really
put that thing away.

99
00:10:25,537 --> 00:10:26,579
Somebody might get hurt.

100
00:10:26,621 --> 00:10:28,915
And who will that be?

101
00:10:28,957 --> 00:10:31,918
Well, like my daddy used to say,
"You never know till you go."

102
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:35,046
Gentlemen.

103
00:10:35,129 --> 00:10:39,300
Blue has been with me a long time. I'm
afraid he takes his job too seriously.

104
00:10:39,384 --> 00:10:42,428
But he is correct, you don't
need to call me anything.

105
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:45,473
Blue will be my
intermediary from now on.

106
00:10:47,975 --> 00:10:49,435
I just wanted you to see me

107
00:10:49,477 --> 00:10:53,314
and have some inkling that
the person you're working for

108
00:10:53,356 --> 00:10:55,233
is not some faceless entity.

109
00:10:55,316 --> 00:10:58,319
So let me get this straight,
I work for you now?

110
00:10:58,361 --> 00:11:00,655
I know you.

111
00:11:00,696 --> 00:11:02,907

across the pond.

this cop identity thing.

You were there, I was there.

114
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:13,542
Remember how we felt about the guy
that went deep into enemy territory,

115
00:11:13,626 --> 00:11:16,712
took care of business
with extreme prejudice,

116
00:11:16,754 --> 00:11:20,883
and made his way out
in one piece?

117
00:11:20,925 --> 00:11:24,095
You know what really
is amazing to me?

118
00:11:24,178 --> 00:11:26,555
A guy that can walk
into an urban territory,

119
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:29,517
a five star hotel
full of bodyguards,

120
00:11:29,558 --> 00:11:32,895
take care of business
with extreme prejudice,

121
00:11:32,978 --> 00:11:37,399
and walk out in one piece
like a fucking ghost.

122
00:11:37,483 --> 00:11:44,031
I guess I had my 15 minutes, but as
you know, I'm kind of retired now.

123
00:11:44,073 --> 00:11:47,117
That's what I like about you.
Do you recognize these?

124
00:11:50,537 --> 00:11:53,540

Man, you guys
are meticulous.

127
00:12:02,966 --> 00:12:05,302
You're a smart man,
Mr. Conner.

128
00:12:07,012 --> 00:12:10,307
I don't need to explain to you
how I came to buy them,

129
00:12:10,391 --> 00:12:12,267
although indeed
I did buy them.

130
00:12:12,351 --> 00:12:17,523
What you owed to others, a
million plus, you now owe to me.

131
00:12:17,606 --> 00:12:20,526
So I guess that means if I
don't do what you want me to do,

132
00:12:20,609 --> 00:12:22,736
you'll terminate me.

in the near future,

136
00:12:32,287 --> 00:12:35,082
and when he does he's
going to make you an offer.

137
00:12:35,165 --> 00:12:37,626
Kind of like an offer
I can't refuse?

138
00:12:39,294 --> 00:12:41,213
You can refuse.

139
00:12:41,296 --> 00:12:45,759
You might want to listen to our
proposition, it might be to your liking.

Unfortunately, he's encouraging
bad behavior from the Italians

I have much of a choice, do I?

00:16:14,674 --> 00:16:16,051
No, you don't.

176
00:16:17,636 --> 00:16:23,558
Well, tell the Old Man
that he's as good as dead.

177
00:16:24,517 --> 00:16:25,852
That's real good.

178

Hey, what are you mad at?

Look who's here.

191
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:08,287
Is that your eyes causing that to
happen? Just looking at me I just...

192

Great grapes.

we'll crack down together.

I'm fine, thank you.

All right, sweetie, I'll pick
you up tomorrow, all right?

204
00:19:18,106 --> 00:19:20,317
Bye.
Bye-bye. Have fun.

I wish Mom and Steve would
let me come here by myself.

But they're worried about the big
kids who hang out near the entrance.

214

I think Mom's worried about
their corrupting influence.

215
00:19:57,937 --> 00:20:01,691
Corrupting influence. Well,
I suppose she's got a point.

216
00:20:03,067 --> 00:20:06,404
I'm precocious, Daddy.
I read that in a book.

00:20:06,446 --> 00:20:10,324
Precocious. Precocious,
well, I guess you know

218
00:20:10,408 --> 00:20:12,910
what your grandmother
would say about that.

Oh, my God.

221
00:20:18,124 --> 00:20:21,252
You asked what she'd say.

222
00:20:21,294 --> 00:20:25,089
You can at least, like, kind
of play innocent next time.

223
00:20:25,131 --> 00:20:27,133
Innocent?
Yeah.

224
00:20:27,216 --> 00:20:28,301

You got a good point.

226

(CHUCKLES)
You got a good point.

227
00:20:37,268 --> 00:20:43,065
Hey, you know, yesterday I was
supposed to pick you up and...

228
00:20:43,941 --> 00:20:45,067
It's okay.

229
00:20:46,986 --> 00:20:49,113
It's not okay. You know,
I feel really bad.

230
00:20:49,155 --> 00:20:53,200
I know that, you know, I really
need to be there for you and...

231
00:20:56,328 --> 00:20:58,622
I know that, Daddy.

232
00:20:58,664 --> 00:21:01,834
I saw your face,
something was bothering you.

233
00:21:01,917 --> 00:21:05,379
Yeah, but, you know, daddies shouldn't
let stuff like that, you know,

234
00:21:05,421 --> 00:21:08,674
get in the way of
daddy-daughter relations.

235
00:21:08,716 --> 00:21:13,679
So I'm going to try to
never let that happen again

236
00:21:13,721 --> 00:21:17,224
and live up to my responsibility
to always be there for you.

237
00:21:17,266 --> 00:21:20,269
I know that, Daddy.

238
00:21:20,352 --> 00:21:22,646
And I'm not little anymore.

239
00:21:25,482 --> 00:21:26,608

I made for you.

that mean, "I heart Daddy"?

00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:38,871
I love Daddy.
Oh, I got it.

243
00:21:38,912 --> 00:21:40,497

dumb, are you?

(CHUCKLING) Sometimes.

245
00:21:43,417 --> 00:21:46,044
I think I've proven that
in the past, haven't I?

246
00:21:46,086 --> 00:21:48,005
You made these?
Yeah.

247
00:21:48,088 --> 00:21:51,383
This looks like jelly and peanut
butter, not peanut butter and jelly.

248
00:21:51,425 --> 00:21:53,552
Yeah. It's kind of a
science project now.

249
00:21:53,593 --> 00:21:55,470
Yeah.

250
00:21:55,554 --> 00:21:56,930
Some jelly with your jelly?

252
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:32,066

253
00:23:36,529 --> 00:23:37,613
Go get a drink.

254
00:23:54,505 --> 00:23:57,883
What, are you a fucking imbecile
or what? Are you an imbecile?

255
00:23:57,925 --> 00:23:59,093
Give me a chance to fix it.

256
00:23:59,176 --> 00:24:01,428
How fucked...
Shut up. Shut...

257
00:24:02,096 --> 00:24:03,889
Get him out of here!

258
00:24:03,931 --> 00:24:05,099
What the fuck is wrong
with that idiot?

259
00:24:05,182 --> 00:24:06,267
I don't know, boss.

260
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:08,310
Bobby, cocktails, will you?

261
00:24:10,855 --> 00:24:11,605
Hey.

262
00:24:13,023 --> 00:24:13,607
Hey.

263
00:24:15,943 --> 00:24:19,655
All these beautiful women in here
and you're staring at this guy?

264
00:24:19,738 --> 00:24:22,074
You know, he got kind of
unusual behavior.

265
00:24:22,157 --> 00:24:26,620
I thought he might be someone
interesting. I just wondered who he is.

266
00:24:26,662 --> 00:24:28,831
He calls himself Bruno.

267
00:24:28,914 --> 00:24:30,541
What's he,
the little movie star?

268
00:24:30,624 --> 00:24:31,709
Something like that.

269
00:24:31,792 --> 00:24:35,421
Wow. I wonder if I could
get his autograph.

270
00:24:37,214 --> 00:24:40,342
I don't think you want it.

271
00:24:40,425 --> 00:24:42,136
You really don't know
who he is? No, I don't.

272
00:24:42,177 --> 00:24:45,931
I'm just passing through,
came in here for a drink.

273
00:24:46,014 --> 00:24:48,350
Well, I'm Drea.

274
00:24:48,392 --> 00:24:50,936
Drea Smalls, by the way, just
in case you're interested.

275
00:24:51,019 --> 00:24:54,106
Well, I'm Matt, and I am.

276
00:24:56,858 --> 00:24:58,694
You are what?

277
00:24:58,777 --> 00:25:00,404
I'm interested.

278
00:25:02,489 --> 00:25:04,116
I could use a drink.

279
00:25:04,199 --> 00:25:07,536
Why don't you sit down and have
a drink with me. What'll you have?

280
00:25:08,829 --> 00:25:11,039
I think I'll have
what you're having.

281
00:25:21,967 --> 00:25:26,012
Hey, around here it's
bad manners to stare.

282
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:28,640
Also bad for your health.

283
00:25:28,723 --> 00:25:31,601
I guess I could stare at you.

284
00:25:31,685 --> 00:25:33,436
I don't know about that.

285
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:41,653
Hey, how are you? Hey.

286
00:25:41,736 --> 00:25:45,115
What do you say? How are you?
Welcome. You got here okay?

287
00:25:45,198 --> 00:25:47,075
Very well. Good, good.
Good to see you again.

288
00:25:47,158 --> 00:25:48,576
We added a figure.

289
00:25:53,456 --> 00:25:54,457
Looks pretty.

290
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,921
You got a few more
of these I hope, right?

291
00:26:01,798 --> 00:26:04,259
So, tell me...
What?

292
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:07,011
What does Drea stand for?
Andrea.

293
00:26:07,095 --> 00:26:09,013
Somewhere along the way
it just got shortened.

294
00:26:09,097 --> 00:26:10,473
Mmm-hmm.

295
00:26:10,515 --> 00:26:12,475
What does Matt stand for?

296
00:26:12,558 --> 00:26:19,107
Matt, like, you know, usually stands
for "dumb, unlucky son of a bitch."

297
00:26:19,148 --> 00:26:21,192
But tonight I thought maybe...

298
00:26:21,275 --> 00:26:22,110
Maybe.

299
00:26:22,151 --> 00:26:24,404
...I won't be so unlucky.

300
00:26:25,488 --> 00:26:27,532
When you going to know
for sure, Matt?

301
00:26:27,615 --> 00:26:30,827
Well, as soon as
you let me know.

302
00:26:33,996 --> 00:26:35,665
Why don't I just tell you?

303
00:26:40,545 --> 00:26:42,004
I think you just did.

304
00:26:42,046 --> 00:26:43,881
I got more to say, come on.

305
00:27:13,285 --> 00:27:14,286
DREA: Wow.

306
00:27:15,621 --> 00:27:17,456
You cook?

307
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:20,125
Yeah, man, I cook, I clean,
I wash dishes, I do it all.

308
00:27:23,545 --> 00:27:26,632
But actually, no,
I don't cook.

309
00:27:26,715 --> 00:27:29,927
Any man can fry
a fucking egg, you know.

310
00:27:31,762 --> 00:27:33,097
So...

311
00:27:34,264 --> 00:27:35,474
So...

312
00:27:35,557 --> 00:27:37,059
Why don't you tell me
about yourself?

313
00:27:41,897 --> 00:27:43,565
What about me?

314
00:27:43,607 --> 00:27:45,609
Well, I'd like to
know anything.

315
00:27:52,032 --> 00:27:54,159
All my life
I've been on my own.

316
00:27:54,243 --> 00:27:56,954
Trying to do more than
just get by, you know?

317
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:04,503
I'm an artist.
You're an artist.

318
00:28:04,586 --> 00:28:07,506
Not like the kind of artist that sells
paintings and stuff, I'm a graphic artist.

319
00:28:07,589 --> 00:28:11,635
I put together brochures and
catalogs, that kind of stuff.

320
00:28:12,511 --> 00:28:13,762
I work freelance now,

321
00:28:13,804 --> 00:28:17,307
but back when I had a
9:00-to-5:00, and I had a bunch,

322
00:28:18,934 --> 00:28:21,603
wherever I worked,
whatever I did,

323
00:28:24,064 --> 00:28:29,027
there was always some guy above me
thinking he could do my job better than me,

324
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:32,530
telling me what I needed to do
to be good enough.

325
00:28:32,614 --> 00:28:33,365
Hmm.

326
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:37,911
And after, like, a bunch
of years I finally realized

327
00:28:37,994 --> 00:28:40,455
what I really needed to do
was grow a dick.

328
00:28:40,497 --> 00:28:45,794
Well, probably I would like you
a lot less if you had a dick.

329
00:28:45,835 --> 00:28:48,254
Especially if it was bigger
than mine, you know what I mean?

330
00:28:48,338 --> 00:28:49,172
I don't think
that's possible.

331
00:29:20,453 --> 00:29:23,039
BRUNO: I love this guy,
I love this kid.

332
00:29:23,081 --> 00:29:24,916
Hey, my favorite.

333
00:29:24,999 --> 00:29:26,876
Hi, guys.
How are you?

334
00:29:26,918 --> 00:29:28,586
Hey, Bruno.
How are you, sweetie?

335
00:29:28,669 --> 00:29:30,046
How you doing tonight?

336
00:29:30,088 --> 00:29:31,339
Better if you'll come
home with me.

337
00:29:31,422 --> 00:29:34,967
Oh, Bruno. What are
you boys drinking?

338
00:29:35,051 --> 00:29:37,303
Come on, give me a kiss.
Give me a small kiss.

339
00:29:37,386 --> 00:29:38,471
Come on, give me one kiss.

340
00:29:38,554 --> 00:29:39,806
No, no, not on duty.

341
00:29:39,889 --> 00:29:41,057
Oh, stop it will you, please?

342
00:29:41,098 --> 00:29:44,602
This manager of yours
is such a chicken shit,

343
00:29:44,685 --> 00:29:46,187
he wouldn't say squat
if you got under the table

344
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:47,647
and blew me right here
in front of everybody.

345
00:29:47,730 --> 00:29:49,690
He wouldn't, you know that.

346
00:29:49,774 --> 00:29:51,275
Don't get fresh.

347
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:52,944
Oh, now. Come on,
come on, come on.

348
00:29:53,027 --> 00:29:55,738
I'm playing. I wasn't fresh,
I wasn't fresh.

349
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:58,282
You remember one thing,
one thing.

350
00:29:58,366 --> 00:30:01,744
I'll fuck you in the ass with my
dick if I want. Now that's fresh.

351
00:30:03,537 --> 00:30:05,664
I think she's got
a crush on you, boss.

352
00:30:05,748 --> 00:30:07,958
I swear to God, I feel the same thing.
I really... She plays hard to get.

353
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,669
Bruno.
Hey, hey, hey, how are you?

354
00:30:10,753 --> 00:30:15,007
Sit down, sit down, sit down.
I was waiting for you.

355
00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:17,301
My friend is a North
Korean gentleman, okay?

356
00:30:17,343 --> 00:30:21,972
He's got 2.5 million
in counterfeit green.

357
00:30:22,014 --> 00:30:24,892
I seen the color, I seen the
plates, I seen the product.

358
00:30:24,975 --> 00:30:26,310
Gentlemen, excuse me
one second.

359
00:30:26,352 --> 00:30:30,564
I know it's really rude for
me to just sit down like this,

360
00:30:30,648 --> 00:30:34,234
but I noticed that along
with your powerful charisma,

361
00:30:34,318 --> 00:30:38,364
you kind of were abusive with
that young lady earlier here.

362
00:30:38,447 --> 00:30:39,990
What are you talking about?
The waitress, Emily?

363
00:30:40,074 --> 00:30:41,533
Yeah.
Yeah.

364
00:30:41,617 --> 00:30:44,203
So I just was
a little bit offended,

365
00:30:44,286 --> 00:30:47,372
and I wondered
if you would apologize to her.

366
00:30:47,873 --> 00:30:49,708
To Emily?
Yeah.

367
00:30:49,792 --> 00:30:51,168
You want me to
apologize to her?

368
00:30:51,251 --> 00:30:53,003
You know, I would do...
No, don't laugh,

369
00:30:53,045 --> 00:30:54,463
I would do that, I would
do that, honest to God.

370
00:30:54,505 --> 00:30:56,673
She obviously means
a lot to you.

371
00:30:56,757 --> 00:30:59,176
Well, yeah,
she's a nice girl.

372
00:30:59,218 --> 00:31:00,469
You know something?

373
00:31:00,552 --> 00:31:03,597
You make me feel, like,
embarrassed with myself.

374
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:06,266
Am I blushing? I'm sorry,
I didn't mean it.

375
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:08,894
You know what, let me make
it up to you, honest to God.

376
00:31:08,977 --> 00:31:11,355
Go ahead.

377
00:31:11,438 --> 00:31:14,608
When I fuck her in the ass, I
won't wipe my cock on her drapes.

378
00:31:14,691 --> 00:31:16,151
That's so nice of you.

379
00:31:16,234 --> 00:31:17,486
It's time to go.

380
00:31:26,787 --> 00:31:28,830
Hold on, I'll pay you.

381
00:31:28,914 --> 00:31:31,750
Hey kid, kid, kid, we talk.
You're not a stupid guy.

382
00:31:31,791 --> 00:31:34,419
What brought you here?

383
00:31:34,503 --> 00:31:37,631
This Korean, I do business
with him, I'm a business man.

384
00:31:37,714 --> 00:31:40,091
I'm gonna say we got about two
minutes before the cops come here.

385
00:31:40,133 --> 00:31:41,843
There's a score here for you.

386
00:31:41,927 --> 00:31:45,680
I got diamonds, I got money, I got
influence, power, broads, pick one.

387
00:31:47,432 --> 00:31:49,559
You didn't come here
for me, did you?

388
00:31:49,601 --> 00:31:51,895
Unfortunately, Bruno, I did.
Hey...

389
00:32:11,539 --> 00:32:14,542
<i>BLUE: But remember, they
all have kids just like you.</i>

390
00:32:33,102 --> 00:32:35,354
Use it or lose it, cowboy.

391
00:32:35,438 --> 00:32:38,149
Where'd you get my keys?

392
00:32:38,232 --> 00:32:40,485
I boosted your spare set
while you were out.

393
00:32:40,568 --> 00:32:41,819
Made a copy
and put them back

394
00:32:41,861 --> 00:32:43,863
before you noticed
they were gone.

395
00:32:43,905 --> 00:32:45,865
You are a sophisticated,
grown-up spy.

396
00:32:45,948 --> 00:32:47,825
Yes, I am.

397
00:32:49,869 --> 00:32:53,039
Somebody had a
very busy night.

398
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:56,167
Well, news travels fast, huh?

399
00:32:56,208 --> 00:32:59,629
It's the Old Man.
He hears everything.

400
00:32:59,712 --> 00:33:02,214
Sometimes before it even happens. Wow.

401
00:33:02,298 --> 00:33:04,050
Blood wasn't
even dry downtown

402
00:33:04,091 --> 00:33:06,886
before the Old Man
knew you had pulled the stunt.

403
00:33:06,969 --> 00:33:10,931
He was very pleased.
I say you were lucky.

404
00:33:11,015 --> 00:33:13,309
Well, that's 'cause
you're jealous.

405
00:33:18,105 --> 00:33:20,941
A bonus from the Old Man.

406
00:33:21,025 --> 00:33:24,945
I told him you don't deserve
it, but he doesn't listen to me.

407
00:33:49,595 --> 00:33:51,054
You're not ready again?

408
00:33:51,096 --> 00:33:52,931
Jesus Christ.
Jesus Christ.

409
00:33:53,015 --> 00:33:58,061
You know, I tried praying to him
one time. I think I'm beyond hope.

410
00:34:03,775 --> 00:34:05,777
Listen, Liz said you stopped
by the house last week.

411
00:34:05,819 --> 00:34:06,945
You wanted to see me?
Yeah.

412
00:34:06,987 --> 00:34:08,947
What it is, there's
a guy called Blue,

413
00:34:08,989 --> 00:34:12,034
that's not a real name,
that's a nickname of some kind,

414
00:34:12,117 --> 00:34:14,911
but he's into some bad stuff

415
00:34:14,953 --> 00:34:16,621
and I wanted to see what
I could find out about him.

416
00:34:16,705 --> 00:34:19,499
Okay. Well, he's none of mine,
but I'll run him.

417
00:34:22,335 --> 00:34:24,463
<i>(MUSIC PLAYING

418
00:35:09,757 --> 00:35:13,928
My contact left the twig in the
park. This is what has the chip.

419
00:35:22,645 --> 00:35:24,772
It's going to Shanghai.

420
00:35:24,856 --> 00:35:27,984
It's got the schematics
for the new fighter jet.

421
00:35:36,743 --> 00:35:41,372
Make sure it gets to my man
in Shanghai tonight.

422
00:35:52,633 --> 00:35:54,552
You take care, you take care.

423
00:35:54,594 --> 00:35:57,054
I don't want to hear
anything more about this.

424
00:35:57,096 --> 00:35:58,139
This ain't a lot of fun.

425
00:36:35,217 --> 00:36:39,138
Police officer, I want
to ask you some questions.

426
00:36:39,179 --> 00:36:41,432
How can I help you?

427
00:36:41,515 --> 00:36:42,308
(SCREAMING)

428
00:36:54,528 --> 00:36:56,155
Get away from me, man.

429
00:36:59,199 --> 00:37:01,034
Who sent you?

430
00:37:01,076 --> 00:37:01,702
(GROANING)

431
00:37:01,743 --> 00:37:03,287
Who sent you?

432
00:37:03,370 --> 00:37:05,164
He was six feet tall.

433
00:37:05,205 --> 00:37:11,420
He's clean shaven. Wears a
blue suit. Arrogant prick.

434
00:37:11,503 --> 00:37:13,547
Thank you very much for that.

435
00:38:37,672 --> 00:38:40,675
Hey, Matt, bottles
don't shoot back.

436
00:38:46,973 --> 00:38:49,308
You set me up.
Bullshit.

437
00:38:55,982 --> 00:38:59,277
Hey, easy, Matt.
I'm on your side, remember?

438
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:03,531
You know, the individuals
that I interviewed

439
00:39:03,573 --> 00:39:06,784
after giving them
a severe talking-to

440
00:39:06,867 --> 00:39:08,286
gave me a very
nice description

441
00:39:08,369 --> 00:39:11,414
of somebody that looks
exactly like you.

442
00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:18,713
Well, you know, they said
extremely unattractive,

443
00:39:18,796 --> 00:39:22,550
light skinned gentleman, dressed
well, but ugly as a son of a bitch.

444
00:39:22,591 --> 00:39:24,677
Oh, jeez, that's only me

445
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:28,597
and maybe a few hundred
thousand other guys in this city.

446
00:39:28,681 --> 00:39:31,809
You know what, Blue?
They was talking about you.

447
00:39:31,892 --> 00:39:34,770
At the time you were
probably fucking drunk.

448
00:39:34,854 --> 00:39:39,108
You better straighten your ass
out, Matt. You got a job to do.

449
00:39:39,149 --> 00:39:42,278
The guy I showed you,
we wanted him dead yesterday.

450
00:39:42,361 --> 00:39:44,613
And it's almost tomorrow.

451
00:39:44,697 --> 00:39:46,115
You're right.

452
00:39:46,156 --> 00:39:49,368
I got to get on top of my
game, and I'm working on it.

Hi, Becky's in school.

456
00:40:45,590 --> 00:40:48,009
Yeah, well, I didn't really
come to see Becky.

457
00:40:48,093 --> 00:40:51,513
Steve was off today and
I wanted to see him.

458
00:40:51,555 --> 00:40:53,390
Yeah, you should have called.

459
00:40:55,517 --> 00:40:57,310
Well, you know,
sometimes when I do that,

460
00:40:57,394 --> 00:41:00,689
he kind of makes up
some bullshit excuse

461
00:41:00,772 --> 00:41:04,651
about what he can't do
and stuff, you know.

462
00:41:04,734 --> 00:41:07,153
That's not what I meant.
It's just... Steve isn't here.

463
00:41:07,237 --> 00:41:09,739
He had something
he needed to take care of,

464
00:41:09,823 --> 00:41:13,410
so I'm afraid you came up
for nothing.

465
00:41:13,451 --> 00:41:17,497
No, I didn't. I got to see
you. And you're looking good.

I'll take a rain check
on that.

470
00:41:33,012 --> 00:41:35,598
You know, you could stay for
dinner. Steve will be home by then,

471
00:41:35,682 --> 00:41:40,311
and then you could talk about
whatever it is that's bothering you.

472
00:41:40,395 --> 00:41:42,772
Yeah, unfortunately,
this won't wait.

473
00:41:42,814 --> 00:41:43,439
Okay.

What, do you need
another favor?

No, I need my balls scratched,
can you help me?

Steve's the man for that,
he's in his office.

All right.

00:43:26,166 --> 00:43:29,336
Well, this is my division.
Roving task force.

483
00:43:29,419 --> 00:43:34,132
We get assignments, six months,
a year, we go where they send us.

drug dealers, whatever.

486
00:43:39,721 --> 00:43:40,931
Well, you know, it's about
time you get your honors.

487
00:43:40,972 --> 00:43:43,475
You got passed up
for a long time,

488
00:43:43,558 --> 00:43:46,061
so I'm glad it's finally
happening for you, that's good.

489
00:43:46,103 --> 00:43:48,146
Yeah.

490
00:43:48,230 --> 00:43:49,397
That's nice.

491
00:43:56,780 --> 00:43:59,282
Let's walk.

492
00:43:59,324 --> 00:44:03,954
So I ran Blue through NCIC, both
as a real name and as an aka.

493
00:44:03,995 --> 00:44:07,082
10% of your guys are dead,
40% are in the slammer,

494
00:44:07,123 --> 00:44:10,335
and the other 50% are so small
that you can't even see them.

495
00:44:10,418 --> 00:44:13,546
Something tells me that the guy
you're looking for is not small-time.

496
00:44:13,630 --> 00:44:15,882
Yeah, I wouldn't think so.
What else you got?

497
00:44:15,965 --> 00:44:18,510
Well, I don't even know
if I should tell you this.

498
00:44:18,593 --> 00:44:22,889
If it was hearsay it'd be more
solid. But I did some checking around.

499
00:44:22,972 --> 00:44:25,600
I know a guy, a fed,
real solid guy, I trust him.

500
00:44:25,683 --> 00:44:29,145
And he asked back
and came back with somebody

501
00:44:29,229 --> 00:44:31,439
who knew somebody
who knew somebody

502
00:44:31,523 --> 00:44:34,484
who used to know a guy
who called himself that. Blue.

Uh-huh.

504
00:44:35,985 --> 00:44:37,529
And what did somebody
who knows somebody

505
00:44:37,612 --> 00:44:39,364
who knows somebody
have to say?

506
00:44:39,405 --> 00:44:43,743
He says this Blue is a very
serious man. A kind of ghost.

507
00:44:43,826 --> 00:44:45,620
The kind of guy that if
you had his latent prints

508
00:44:45,703 --> 00:44:48,873
you couldn't match them to any
database because they don't exist.

509
00:44:48,956 --> 00:44:51,417
Look, Matt,
just watch yourself.

510
00:44:51,501 --> 00:44:53,544
I don't want to have to be the
guy that tells your daughter

511
00:44:53,628 --> 00:44:57,048
that I had to fish you out

Mmm-hmm.

He's our asset in there.

He owes us a favor. He's going
to meet you in the kitchen.

flood the US with counterfeit money,

578
00:53:31,933 --> 00:53:36,604
he was responsible for at

579
00:53:36,646 --> 00:53:38,940
Now, do you feel bad
about what you did to him?

No.
No.

581
00:53:41,192 --> 00:53:45,447

little girl being about Becky's age,

every night over losing her old man.

but he was probably
a good dad.

piled in a warehouse.</i>

neither's the money.

around for somebody to blame,

605

and they didn't have
to look very far.

606
00:55:10,489 --> 00:55:12,700
Except I really didn't
take the money.

that I used to take girls to, you know.

611
00:55:28,298 --> 00:55:33,595
I didn't really tell Steve what
happened, only that I didn't do it.

612
00:55:33,679 --> 00:55:38,142
I begged him for help. He owed
me because I'd saved his life.

613
00:55:38,225 --> 00:55:43,397
So he lied to the brass and said
I was with him on a stakeout.

614
00:55:45,023 --> 00:55:48,235
As soon as he said that,
I was off the hook.

They couldn't put me in jail,
but they threw me off the force.

616
00:55:54,324 --> 00:55:59,913

Oh, yes, the police
detective. He's spoken of you.

679
01:03:26,022 --> 01:03:27,940
Wait. What's happening?

680
01:03:30,777 --> 01:03:32,111
I'm out.

681
01:03:32,153 --> 01:03:33,321
Lower your piece, Matt.

682
01:03:33,404 --> 01:03:37,450
No, Blue, you lower yours.

683
01:03:37,492 --> 01:03:40,745
You know what I sense in this?
A divine sense of fate.

684
01:03:44,624 --> 01:03:47,793
You hold your fate
in your hands here, Matt.

685
01:03:47,835 --> 01:03:49,712
You know,
you took your life back.

686
01:03:49,795 --> 01:03:53,215
A week ago you were wandering
aimlessly, now look at you.

687
01:03:53,299 --> 01:03:55,259
Yeah. Let me
ask you something.

688
01:03:55,301 --> 01:03:57,470
It seems like you all want me
to kill one of my best friends.

689
01:03:57,511 --> 01:03:59,472
See, that's why I got
a little bit upset.

690
01:03:59,555 --> 01:04:04,268
Steve is a piss-ant cop
making $80,000 a year

691
01:04:04,310 --> 01:04:06,270
who just made detective.

692
01:04:06,312 --> 01:04:09,982
I look at him as an innocent
victim. I'm confused.

693
01:04:10,024 --> 01:04:14,945
Hey, Matt, Steve was working
for both of the other targets.

694
01:04:15,029 --> 01:04:18,449
Using his new division to support
them and feed them information.

695
01:04:18,491 --> 01:04:20,201
It's all very nice,
very clean.

696
01:04:20,284 --> 01:04:23,996
He kills somebody for them, then
he's appointed to solve the crime.

697
01:04:24,079 --> 01:04:27,917
Now Bruno and Ling,
they were working with Steve.

698
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:31,128
He's not on the take,
he's one of them.

699
01:04:31,211 --> 01:04:33,839
I find that hard to believe.

700
01:04:35,299 --> 01:04:36,550
I really do.

701
01:04:36,634 --> 01:04:38,302
Is there anything wrong?

702
01:04:38,385 --> 01:04:40,054
Well, Matt might
be in trouble.

703
01:04:40,137 --> 01:04:43,891
Do you have any idea where
he might be? Where he is?

704
01:04:45,893 --> 01:04:49,897
The only places I can think of are
the usual ones you'd know yourself.

705
01:04:49,938 --> 01:04:53,859
His home, the bars he frequents,
places he likes to gamble.

706
01:04:53,901 --> 01:04:56,111
I have a few men checking
those places out,

707
01:04:56,195 --> 01:04:58,071
but I don't think we're
going to have much luck.

708
01:04:58,155 --> 01:05:02,242
He's dirty, Matt,
he's dirty to the core.

709
01:05:02,326 --> 01:05:04,244
He's dirtier
than you ever were.

710
01:05:04,286 --> 01:05:07,831
Who do you think took that
money out of the warehouse?

711
01:05:07,915 --> 01:05:10,500
See, now you're reaching.
Why?

712
01:05:10,584 --> 01:05:13,003
Because you know what?
It just doesn't make sense.

713
01:05:13,086 --> 01:05:17,257
Steve got caught lying for me,
lost days with pay,

714
01:05:17,341 --> 01:05:19,426
and the fact of the matter is,
if he hadn't done that,

715
01:05:19,509 --> 01:05:21,845
he'd have made detective
four years ago.

716
01:05:21,928 --> 01:05:23,847
He lied to you.

717
01:05:23,930 --> 01:05:28,518
You saved his life, he lied for
you, that's it, nothing more.

718
01:05:28,602 --> 01:05:31,521
Did he tell you anything
about it, us, him and me?

719
01:05:31,605 --> 01:05:34,983
I'm afraid I can't tell you. The
privacy of the confessional and all.

720
01:05:35,066 --> 01:05:37,277
I understand, Father,

721
01:05:37,319 --> 01:05:40,488
but this isn't about putting Matt in
jail, this is about trying to help him.

722
01:05:40,989 --> 01:05:42,782

could find him, Detective,

723
01:05:42,866 --> 01:05:44,451
I would tell you and gladly.

724
01:05:44,534 --> 01:05:46,411
But that's one thing
I have no idea about.

725
01:05:46,453 --> 01:05:47,787
What did he tell
you about us?

726
01:05:47,871 --> 01:05:51,124
I told you, Detective,
whatever Matt said to me,

727
01:05:51,166 --> 01:05:53,043
I can't speak of such things.

728
01:06:01,051 --> 01:06:03,511

your help, Father.

just have him give me a call.

844
01:19:56,003 --> 01:19:59,632
All that good loving
you gave me,

845
01:19:59,673 --> 01:20:02,343
was that from you
or from them?

846
01:20:02,384 --> 01:20:05,220
That was from me,
because I wanted to.

847
01:20:07,806 --> 01:20:09,433
Because you felt sorry for me.

848
01:20:11,643 --> 01:20:13,270
Because I wanted you.

849
01:20:16,190 --> 01:20:17,733
You did that real good.

850
01:20:27,451 --> 01:20:32,372
Besides you, the Old Man and Blue, you
know if there's anybody else involved?

851
01:20:33,624 --> 01:20:36,209
I have no idea.

852
01:20:36,251 --> 01:20:40,130
Could be just us, could be
hundreds of others just like us.

853
01:20:41,882 --> 01:20:43,634
I don't wanna know.
You're smart.

854
01:20:45,427 --> 01:20:50,307
It's just like
these folks, man,

855
01:20:50,390 --> 01:20:54,061
they might tell you to kill your
mama, your brother, your sister.

856
01:20:55,979 --> 01:20:59,816
Your child's step-daddy,
you know.

857
01:21:01,568 --> 01:21:03,403
And it don't work for me.

858
01:21:03,445 --> 01:21:09,993
You survived that. You
walked away. Walk away again.

859
01:21:10,076 --> 01:21:12,913
I ain't running no more.
Tired of running.

01:21:43,651 --> 01:21:45,320

01:22:00,668 --> 01:22:02,128
Matt?

Matt?

He leadeth me beside the
still waters. He restoreth...

Matt?

867
01:22:39,790 --> 01:22:41,876
He restoreth my soul...

868
01:22:49,341 --> 01:22:53,220
He leadeth me in the paths of
righteousness for his name's sake.

here, and you know what's at stake.

Where's Wheeler?

872
01:23:04,106 --> 01:23:06,734
He's got a special assignment,
don't worry about it.

873
01:23:06,775 --> 01:23:09,528
All right, fan out,
and watch my back.

What are you doing here?

875
01:24:17,262 --> 01:24:19,264
I came to pay my respects.

876
01:24:19,347 --> 01:24:21,266
You didn't have to
wait for me.

877
01:24:22,392 --> 01:24:24,686
I see you brought
the long rifle.

878
01:24:24,728 --> 01:24:25,687
You know it.

879
01:24:25,729 --> 01:24:28,940
I've already done my recon.

880
01:24:29,024 --> 01:24:33,695
Higher ground, on top of that mausoleum
looks like the best spot right there.

881
01:24:35,613 --> 01:24:37,866
It's exactly
what I was thinking.

882
01:25:08,771 --> 01:25:12,275
How'd you know it was me?
Why didn't you kill Blue?

883
01:25:16,154 --> 01:25:18,739
See, unfortunately, Tim
Wheeler knew my sad story

884
01:25:18,781 --> 01:25:21,159
about how I passed out
in my flophouse.

885
01:25:21,242 --> 01:25:24,871
I think you came there.
You knew I'd have no alibi.

886
01:25:26,706 --> 01:25:30,877
Went back to the precinct, stole
the shit out of the evidence room.

887
01:25:30,960 --> 01:25:33,838
Got greedy, decided
to kill my partner.

888
01:25:38,217 --> 01:25:40,678
The guy had
a guilty conscience.

889
01:25:40,761 --> 01:25:42,763
He was going to crack,
I didn't have a choice.

890
01:25:42,805 --> 01:25:46,142
No, I think you did
have a choice.

891
01:25:46,225 --> 01:25:50,813
I don't think you had to steal the money
and I don't think you had to kill my partner,

892
01:25:50,896 --> 01:25:52,148
but you're just
a piece of shit, Steve.

893
01:25:54,275 --> 01:25:56,819
STEVE: Who are you
to judge me?

894
01:25:56,902 --> 01:25:59,405
Who the fuck are you
to judge me?

895
01:25:59,488 --> 01:26:01,907
I lied for you, I paid
your fucking gambling debts,

896
01:26:01,991 --> 01:26:05,578
I got you back on your feet.
Why do you think I did that?

897
01:26:05,661 --> 01:26:11,875
Probably 'cause you were afraid I'd
kill you if I ever found out the truth.

898
01:26:11,917 --> 01:26:17,381
And maybe you felt a
little guilty, too, somehow.

899
01:26:17,464 --> 01:26:21,719
You should have just walked away,
Matt, when I gave you the chance.

900
01:26:21,802 --> 01:26:27,141
You're out-manned, out-gunned.
You're not getting out of this alive.

You know something?
I'm not planning on it.

902
01:26:30,853 --> 01:26:33,897
Then why'd you come here?

903
01:26:33,981 --> 01:26:36,108
I came here to kill you.

904
01:26:39,403 --> 01:26:42,072
Yeah, well,
I didn't come alone.

905
01:26:45,576 --> 01:26:47,703
Yeah, neither did I.

cremated or buried?
