[Lucca] <i>I never really thought</i><i>
much about rain before.</i>

00:01:51,633 --> 00:01:55,767

00:01:55,898 --> 00:01:57,769

6
00:02:04,733 --> 00:02:08,911
<i>Perfect, beautiful,</i><i>
one of a kind.</i>

7
00:02:09,041 --> 00:02:11,522
<i>Finally, the difference</i><i>
between the trivial</i><i>
and the important</i>

8

9
00:02:15,613 --> 00:02:19,269
<i>Yet now, the difference</i><i>
is no longer important.</i>

10
00:02:19,791 --> 00:02:21,402

11
00:02:21,532 --> 00:02:23,752
[woman] I'm sick of you
yelling at me!

12
00:02:54,086 --> 00:02:55,175
Dad.

13
00:02:58,090 --> 00:02:59,570
If you're in there,

14
00:03:00,658 --> 00:03:02,182
happy birthday.

15
00:03:07,622 --> 00:03:09,624
We're leaving
some presents
by the door.

16
00:03:13,149 --> 00:03:14,498
Love you, Dad.

Hey, Jon!

Aw, look at
the sleeping beauty.

Jon! Jon!

34
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:32,332
Sorry, I forgot
about your birthday.

35
00:05:34,246 --> 00:05:36,379
I heard you've
been in a hospital.
You okay?

36
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:39,774
Yeah.

37
00:05:42,777 --> 00:05:44,387
I heard you're dying.

What can I do for you?

41
00:05:55,877 --> 00:05:57,487
I want to take
a ride with you.

42
00:05:59,881 --> 00:06:00,882
Ride?

43
00:06:02,057 --> 00:06:03,014
What do
you got in mind?

44
00:06:03,928 --> 00:06:05,103
Just talk.

45
00:06:06,931 --> 00:06:07,976
Talk?

46
00:06:09,064 --> 00:06:10,500
Well, why not?

[engine starts]

48
00:06:44,795 --> 00:06:46,057
So, tell me,
how's the family?

49
00:06:54,283 --> 00:06:55,545
How's the
hardware business?

50
00:06:58,069 --> 00:06:59,810
Oh, I don't know.
It's a living.

51
00:06:59,941 --> 00:07:02,378
Same thing day in,
day out.

52
00:07:02,509 --> 00:07:04,206
Nuts, bolts
and backed-up toilets.

53
00:07:14,172 --> 00:07:15,217
Uh...

54
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:18,046
I don't mean
to sound morbid,

55
00:07:18,176 --> 00:07:20,048
but how much time
did they say you have?

56
00:07:21,702 --> 00:07:23,094
A week, a month...

57
00:07:24,095 --> 00:07:25,227
Who the fuck knows?

58
00:07:31,363 --> 00:07:32,930
Some benefits
in dying, though.

59
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:35,672
Get to smoke
all you want.

60
00:07:38,327 --> 00:07:41,069
And morphine...
[chuckles]

61
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:42,505
It's a world
all its own.

62
00:08:23,198 --> 00:08:26,288
When warm blood
soaks into something,

63
00:08:26,418 --> 00:08:28,116
no matter how long ago,
it changes it.

64
00:08:31,293 --> 00:08:33,513
Asphalt, dirt, cement.

65
00:08:34,775 --> 00:08:36,037
Gravel.

66

[indistinct chatter over radio]

70
00:09:29,133 --> 00:09:31,092
Probably been dead
three or four hours.

71
00:09:31,222 --> 00:09:32,876
Rigor sets in fast
on thin people.

72
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:37,228
[Brownlee] We had
a 300-pound guy last week.

73
00:09:37,359 --> 00:09:39,491
He must have been dead
for two days,
and he was still warm.

74
00:09:39,622 --> 00:09:41,885
I never seen
nothing like this.

75
00:09:42,016 --> 00:09:43,887
No sign of robbery.

76
00:09:44,018 --> 00:09:45,367
No rape. Nothing.

77
00:09:47,456 --> 00:09:50,938
We'll preserve the scene
best we can.

78
00:09:51,068 --> 00:09:53,244
Dust for prints,
take some photos.

79
00:09:54,506 --> 00:09:55,856
We'll take it
from there.

80
00:09:58,119 --> 00:10:00,730
Looks like
somebody killed them
just for the hell of it,

81
00:10:00,861 --> 00:10:01,992
no reason.

82
00:10:03,211 --> 00:10:05,300
There was a reason.

83
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:06,388
There's
always a reason.

<i>Dr. Hassman...</i>

86
00:10:13,177 --> 00:10:15,484
All we got to do is
walk them through
the first few steps

87
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:18,182
and then head back
into the city.
It's no big deal.

88
00:10:18,313 --> 00:10:20,315
You'll be at the ball game,
if it isn't rained out.

89
00:10:20,445 --> 00:10:22,404
Yeah, right.
I'll be asleep
by the third inning,

90
00:10:22,534 --> 00:10:24,188
but I do love coming
to the hospital.

91
00:10:24,319 --> 00:10:26,974
Candy stripers in those
cute white outfits.

92
00:10:27,104 --> 00:10:29,541
-First time
I've ever seen this.
-[Lucca] What's that?

93
00:10:29,672 --> 00:10:32,849
These tattoos,
made with a knife.
Doesn't make sense.

94
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:34,155
Why would a kid
do something like that?

95
00:10:34,285 --> 00:10:35,809
[Lucca] Skinny.

96
00:10:35,939 --> 00:10:40,465
Yeah. The kids
called him "beanpole."
Real nice kid.

97
00:10:40,596 --> 00:10:42,859
His father
owned the bait shop
up on Vernon Road.

98
00:10:44,339 --> 00:10:45,645

trying to look
tougher,

[clears throat]
It just doesn't seem right.

101
00:10:53,609 --> 00:10:55,698
One pair of panties, white...

102
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,309
[Lucca] Get some clamps.

103

...covered
with black hearts.

104
00:11:06,535 --> 00:11:09,451
It's a 9mm XMC.
Hollowpoint.

105
00:11:11,366 --> 00:11:13,020
Same as the others.

[Lloyd] Hey, Jon,
you all right?

108
00:11:18,199 --> 00:11:19,156
Huh?

109
00:11:21,289 --> 00:11:23,030
Was it like this?

110
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,727
Her leg was bent.

111
00:11:27,425 --> 00:11:30,472
She was
such a good kid,
real popular.

112
00:11:34,215 --> 00:11:35,695
I thought
you didn't know her.

113
00:11:35,825 --> 00:11:38,436
Well, not really,
but it was a small town
back then.

114
00:11:38,567 --> 00:11:40,177
She used to work
at the Tasty Freeze.

115
00:11:41,962 --> 00:11:43,093
She would always give you

116
00:11:43,224 --> 00:11:45,269
an extra scoop
on your sugar cone
for free.

117
00:11:48,229 --> 00:11:51,493
I'll never forget it.
Half of Verde Dero
showed up for the funeral.

118
00:11:51,623 --> 00:11:53,974
I'd have gone, but
I couldn't get out of work.

119

[Lucca] "Quick,
said Bambi's mother,
run for the thicket.

120

Bambi darted away.

121
00:12:13,645 --> 00:12:15,560
He heard
his mother's hoof beats
behind him."

[imitates hoof beats]

123
00:12:18,476 --> 00:12:21,131
"Then another roar
from man's guns.

Terrified,
he ran faster.

125
00:12:24,265 --> 00:12:26,136
His mother
was nowhere in sight.

126
00:12:26,267 --> 00:12:27,355
He sniffed
for her scent.

127
00:12:27,485 --> 00:12:29,270
[sniffs]

128
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,228
Nothing.
'Mother,' he called.

129

'Where are you?'

The prince buck
of the forest

131

appeared beside Bambi.

132
00:12:37,321 --> 00:12:39,193
Your mother can't
be with you anymore.

133
00:12:39,323 --> 00:12:40,585
She's hurt.

134
00:12:40,716 --> 00:12:42,544
She's going
to be okay,

135
00:12:42,674 --> 00:12:44,546
but she just
has to get some rest."

136
00:12:44,676 --> 00:12:46,983
Dad, that's not
how the story goes.

137
00:12:47,114 --> 00:12:48,680
The hunters killed her.

138
00:12:48,811 --> 00:12:51,509
Yeah, she's not just hurt,
she's dead.

139
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,163
Who's reading
the story?

140
00:12:53,294 --> 00:12:55,165
Yeah, well,
just read it right.

141
00:12:55,296 --> 00:12:57,080
Yeah, read it right.

142
00:12:57,211 --> 00:12:58,429
I'll try.

143
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,083
[jazz music playing]

144
00:13:02,172 --> 00:13:03,130
[Ann] Did it work?

145
00:13:04,305 --> 00:13:05,915
Yeah,
I think it did.

146
00:13:08,222 --> 00:13:09,136
[sighs]

147
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,618
At least their eyes
were closed as I snuck out.

148
00:13:13,923 --> 00:13:15,055
Hmm.

149
00:13:30,244 --> 00:13:31,462
A couple of kids
were killed today,

150
00:13:33,116 --> 00:13:34,596
up near lovers' lane.

151
00:13:37,077 --> 00:13:38,774
Yeah.

152
00:13:38,905 --> 00:13:40,471
Yeah,
I heard about it
on the news.

153
00:13:43,953 --> 00:13:45,607
Remember when we used
to go up to Twin Peaks?

154
00:13:45,737 --> 00:13:46,826
[chuckles]

155
00:13:47,739 --> 00:13:48,697
You never
did figure out

156
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:51,004
how to get my bra off
with one hand.

157
00:13:53,354 --> 00:13:56,009
All I could think about

158
00:13:56,139 --> 00:13:58,315
was one of our girls
up there,

159
00:13:58,446 --> 00:14:00,143
making out
with some kid.

160
00:14:01,057 --> 00:14:02,319
You know, Jon,

161
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:04,278
I think you'll have
got whoever did it

162
00:14:04,408 --> 00:14:07,150
before the girls are
old enough to date.
Don't you?

177
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:08,472
Good luck.
You're going to need it.

178
00:15:08,603 --> 00:15:10,083
Me: two. You: zero."

179
00:15:10,213 --> 00:15:11,693
Look at the signature.

180
00:15:11,823 --> 00:15:12,824
I take it you're
the big city dick
he's talking about.

181
00:15:12,955 --> 00:15:15,305
Yeah. But it ain't
no big thing.

182
00:15:15,436 --> 00:15:17,655
Well, this is a first.
I mean, I can't remember
any other killer

183
00:15:17,786 --> 00:15:19,353
pulling a stunt
like this.

184
00:15:19,483 --> 00:15:21,355
Taunting the police,
giving information.

185
00:15:21,485 --> 00:15:23,487
Jack the Ripper did it.
Look at his Ns.

186
00:15:23,618 --> 00:15:25,141
Yeah, so what do we do?

187
00:15:25,272 --> 00:15:26,490
I mean, uh,
if this guy is for real,

188
00:15:26,621 --> 00:15:28,753
we've got ourselves
a big problem here.

189
00:15:28,884 --> 00:15:30,886
How do we know
the whole thing
isn't a hoax?

190
00:15:31,017 --> 00:15:33,149
I'm not going
to let some nutcase

191
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,717
put the whole city
into a panic.

192
00:15:35,847 --> 00:15:37,545
We've got a responsibility
to our readers.

193
00:15:37,675 --> 00:15:39,199
Yeah, right.

194
00:15:39,329 --> 00:15:40,591
Got to sell
those papers, huh?

195
00:15:42,811 --> 00:15:44,117
Nobody could
figure it out.

196
00:15:46,162 --> 00:15:47,381
[coughs]

197
00:15:54,649 --> 00:15:57,217
He shot half

198
00:15:57,347 --> 00:15:59,610
the windows
out of the car
at close range,

199
00:15:59,741 --> 00:16:01,264
missing the kids.

200
00:16:06,922 --> 00:16:10,708
Then he shoots
five times,

201
00:16:10,839 --> 00:16:12,406
and hits the girl
in the back

202
00:16:13,581 --> 00:16:15,278
in a tight circle...

203
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,499
In the dark.

204
00:16:18,629 --> 00:16:20,283
Running on gravel.

205
00:16:20,414 --> 00:16:21,545
[coughs]

206
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,331
One hell of a shot.

207
00:16:25,636 --> 00:16:26,768
Or a lucky
son of a bitch.

208
00:16:34,384 --> 00:16:35,472
Huh...

209
00:16:37,387 --> 00:16:38,432
What?

210
00:16:40,782 --> 00:16:43,045
Well, maybe he didn't
want to hit them at first.

211
00:16:44,742 --> 00:16:46,570
Maybe he...

212
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:51,401
Aw, I don't know.

213
00:17:01,585 --> 00:17:03,152
Maybe he wanted them
to see him.

214
00:17:04,501 --> 00:17:06,503
Maybe that's
the only way
he could get off.

215
00:17:08,244 --> 00:17:09,158
Get off?

216
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:31,920
Nobody wanted
to admit it.

217
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,922
These were
sex crimes.

218
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,358
I thought
he never touched them.

219
00:17:35,489 --> 00:17:36,620
He didn't.

220
00:17:38,927 --> 00:17:41,234
But I'll bet
he returned to the site
over and over again,

221
00:17:41,364 --> 00:17:43,671
reliving the moment

222
00:17:43,801 --> 00:17:45,194
until he couldn't
get a kick out of it.

223
00:17:46,804 --> 00:17:48,415
Then he went out
and did his thing

224
00:17:48,545 --> 00:17:50,460
and then started
the process
all over again.

225
00:17:54,856 --> 00:17:56,205
Very good.

226
00:18:04,474 --> 00:18:06,433
His car was
important to him,

227
00:18:06,563 --> 00:18:08,565
the only way
he could move
amongst normal people.

228
00:18:10,045 --> 00:18:11,438
He held
his sickness in

229
00:18:11,568 --> 00:18:12,743
where he could
feed off of it.

230
00:18:16,486 --> 00:18:17,879
The car kept it in

231
00:18:18,009 --> 00:18:19,837
where the outside world
couldn't see or feel it.

232
00:18:21,883 --> 00:18:23,754
Made him feel protected.

233
00:18:34,896 --> 00:18:37,725
[Lloyd] You amaze me
with your insights.

234
00:18:37,855 --> 00:18:39,248
Let me ask you
something.

235
00:18:40,597 --> 00:18:41,903
Are you all right?

236
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:45,428
What do you mean
"protected"?

237
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:46,473
From what? From whom?

238
00:18:47,691 --> 00:18:48,866
It looked like
it was the world

239
00:18:48,997 --> 00:18:51,478
that needed to be
protected from him.

240
00:18:51,608 --> 00:18:53,480
That's... That's
how it felt to me.

241
00:19:05,448 --> 00:19:06,797
That is far out.

242
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,370
[car approaches]

243
00:19:14,501 --> 00:19:15,458
Whoa.
Get rid of that.

244
00:19:21,638 --> 00:19:22,944
What if it's the cops?

245
00:19:23,074 --> 00:19:24,467
Just relax.

246
00:19:29,777 --> 00:19:31,257
That was close.

247
00:19:40,962 --> 00:19:42,311
Now what?

248
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,531
Who is it?

249
00:19:44,661 --> 00:19:45,662
What does he want?

250
00:19:45,793 --> 00:19:46,881
I don't know.

251
00:19:47,011 --> 00:19:48,230
What if
it's my dad?

252
00:19:48,883 --> 00:19:50,014
Where's the dope?

253
00:19:50,145 --> 00:19:51,973
I thought you had it.

254
00:19:52,103 --> 00:19:53,496
Where's the dope?

255
00:19:53,627 --> 00:19:54,932
Brian, I'm scared.

256
00:19:55,063 --> 00:19:56,369
Hey, man,
what do you want?

257
00:19:56,499 --> 00:19:57,935
He's coming closer.

258
00:19:58,066 --> 00:19:59,372
Oh, my God.
He's got a gun.

259
00:19:59,502 --> 00:20:00,808
[gun fires]

260
00:20:00,938 --> 00:20:02,636
[groaning]

261
00:20:11,775 --> 00:20:12,776
[moaning]

262
00:20:23,744 --> 00:20:24,701
[man] Hmm.

263
00:20:31,926 --> 00:20:33,232
[gun firing]

264
00:20:57,604 --> 00:20:59,432
[chatter over police radio]

265
00:21:13,184 --> 00:21:14,751
[Lucca] <i>
"Dear Detective Lucca,</i>

270
00:21:26,023 --> 00:21:28,591

271
00:21:28,722 --> 00:21:30,724

272
00:21:30,854 --> 00:21:32,682
<i>which only I</i><i>
and the police know.</i>

273
00:21:32,813 --> 00:21:35,772
One, brand name of ammo,
Super X.

274
00:21:35,903 --> 00:21:38,209
Two, nine shots were fired.

275
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:40,037
Three, the boy
was on his back

276
00:21:40,168 --> 00:21:42,039
with his feet
to the car.

277
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:44,520
Four, the girl
was on her right side

278
00:21:44,651 --> 00:21:46,566
with her feet
to the west.

279
00:21:46,696 --> 00:21:48,829
The girl was wearing
patterned slacks.

280
00:21:48,959 --> 00:21:51,788
The boy was also shot
in the knee. Western ammo.

281
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:53,921
When I fired
the first shot
at his head,

282
00:21:54,051 --> 00:21:56,445
he leaped backwards
at the same time,

283
00:21:56,576 --> 00:21:58,186
thus spoiling my aim.

284
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,101
He ended up
on the back seat,

285
00:22:00,231 --> 00:22:03,191
thrashing out
very violently
with his legs.

286
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:05,541
That's how I shot him
in the knee.

287
00:22:05,672 --> 00:22:07,151
To assist you
in your investigation,

288
00:22:07,282 --> 00:22:10,024
I've enclosed
a composite drawing
of myself.

289
00:22:10,154 --> 00:22:12,505
If you don't
run this drawing
in tomorrow's paper,

290
00:22:12,635 --> 00:22:13,854
bad things will come.

291
00:22:13,984 --> 00:22:16,160
Me: four. You: zero."

292
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:18,380
[Fredricks]
The guy's keeping score,
for Christ sakes.

293
00:22:18,511 --> 00:22:20,513
A third of the guys
on the force
look like this.

294
00:22:20,643 --> 00:22:22,123
Don't dismiss the fact

295
00:22:22,253 --> 00:22:23,994
that this guy
could be such
an egotistical maniac

296
00:22:24,125 --> 00:22:25,822
that he'd send us
an accurate drawing
of himself.

297
00:22:25,953 --> 00:22:27,650
[Brownlee] Why's
he writing to you, Jon?

298
00:22:27,781 --> 00:22:29,783
Who's he going
to write to,
Steve McQueen?

299
00:22:31,132 --> 00:22:32,176
He wants me involved.

300
00:22:32,307 --> 00:22:33,961
[Payne] Okay, okay.

301
00:22:34,091 --> 00:22:35,528
Aside from
his artistic skills,

302
00:22:35,658 --> 00:22:36,616
what else do we
know about him?

303
00:22:36,746 --> 00:22:38,748
A lot.

304
00:22:38,879 --> 00:22:42,665
He kills on weekends
around bodies of water,
lovers' lanes.

305
00:22:42,796 --> 00:22:44,493
No robberies,
no sex.

306
00:22:44,624 --> 00:22:46,974
He's one hell of a shot.

307
00:22:47,104 --> 00:22:49,585
[Payne] We're going to have
to release the letter.

308
00:22:49,716 --> 00:22:52,283
You guys better get ready
for a nightmare.

309
00:22:52,414 --> 00:22:54,111
[newsreader] <i>Homicide police</i><i>

310
00:22:54,242 --> 00:22:56,766

Is he?

314
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,730
Just a sec.
I'll come see.

315
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:05,035
Huh? What have
we got here?

316
00:23:05,166 --> 00:23:07,386
Oh! It looks like...
What are you guys
playing?

317
00:23:07,516 --> 00:23:09,083
We're just
rolling these
down there.

318
00:23:09,213 --> 00:23:11,085
[Ann] Well, you know...

319
00:23:11,215 --> 00:23:13,740
We've got
the real thing.

320
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:15,306
[Ann's father] It must
give you the creeps, huh, Jon?

321
00:23:15,437 --> 00:23:17,004
Having that guy
writing to you?

322
00:23:17,134 --> 00:23:18,701
[Ann] Guys threaten Jon
all the time.

323
00:23:18,832 --> 00:23:20,094
Honey, dinner.

324
00:23:20,224 --> 00:23:21,922
We get a dozen
Christmas cards

325
00:23:22,052 --> 00:23:23,837
from San Quentin
every year.

326
00:23:23,967 --> 00:23:26,100
We even got one
from the guy who
shot Jon last year.

327
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:27,797
-Hmm.
-That was fun.

328
00:23:27,928 --> 00:23:29,016
People don't want
to go out at night.

329
00:23:29,146 --> 00:23:30,931
Business at the store
is down 70%.

330
00:23:31,061 --> 00:23:32,933
-Here, dear.
-Thank you.

331
00:23:33,063 --> 00:23:35,239
-More candles, hmm?
-Look, can we just please
stop talking about this?

332
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:36,937
I'm not going
to say it again.

333
00:23:37,067 --> 00:23:38,678
That sauce needs
more red wine.

334
00:23:38,808 --> 00:23:40,854
I don't know.
This feels different,
and I don't know why.

335
00:23:43,073 --> 00:23:45,728
[Ann] Look, I don't want
to talk about this
anymore.

336
00:23:45,859 --> 00:23:48,514
I want us to have
a very nice
family dinner.

337
00:23:48,644 --> 00:23:49,776
Promise?

338
00:23:52,909 --> 00:23:55,434
That's when he started
writing to me directly.

339
00:23:57,174 --> 00:23:59,176
I remember.

340
00:23:59,307 --> 00:24:00,917
You couldn't
pick up a paper

341
00:24:01,048 --> 00:24:02,832
or put on the TV
without seeing you.

342
00:24:03,833 --> 00:24:05,139
Everybody knew
who you were.

343
00:24:06,314 --> 00:24:07,576
He made you
a celebrity.

344
00:24:11,885 --> 00:24:13,103
I was just doing my job.

345
00:24:16,585 --> 00:24:18,848
Everybody was waiting
for you to catch him.

346
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,464
It must've been
very frustrating.

347
00:24:29,424 --> 00:24:30,730
[Brownlee] Man, ever since
you talked the Chief

348
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:32,253
into running
that damn drawing,

349
00:24:32,383 --> 00:24:33,776
we've had calls
from everybody
and their uncle,

350
00:24:33,907 --> 00:24:37,084
saying the Scorekeeper's
their mailman
or their neighbor.

351
00:24:37,214 --> 00:24:38,651
[chuckles]
Or even their husbands!

352
00:24:40,304 --> 00:24:42,263
I mean, we've had 200,
300 husbands so far.

353
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:44,874
Yeah, but no mothers.

354
00:24:48,399 --> 00:24:49,923
I'll bet you 10 bucks
this broad says her kid

355
00:24:50,053 --> 00:24:51,925
looks just like
Scorekeeper.

356
00:24:52,055 --> 00:24:53,753
He was the first
serial killer.

357
00:24:53,883 --> 00:24:55,363
Before him, there
was no such thing.

358
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:58,061
There wasn't
even a label.

359
00:24:58,192 --> 00:24:59,759
We had no idea
what we were
dealing with.

360
00:25:00,803 --> 00:25:02,152
That's right.

361
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:07,375
Serial killers are
a dime a dozen
nowadays, huh?

362
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:10,160
Bundy, Gacy,
Kemper, Ramirez...

363
00:25:10,291 --> 00:25:12,075
Not to mention Dahmer.

364
00:25:13,163 --> 00:25:15,862
Seems like they come
in bunches, huh?

365
00:25:15,992 --> 00:25:17,254
Yeah, if you can
get a book deal

366
00:25:17,385 --> 00:25:20,083
or a motion picture
made out of it...

367
00:25:20,214 --> 00:25:23,478
You get your picture
on the cover of <i>Time.</i>

368
00:25:23,609 --> 00:25:27,961
Really. They always
make these guys out
to be such geniuses.

369
00:25:28,091 --> 00:25:32,574
David Berkowitz,
Son of Sam, remember?
[chuckles]

370
00:25:33,357 --> 00:25:35,534
Some criminal mastermind.

371
00:25:35,664 --> 00:25:37,013
He got caught
'cause he parked
in a red zone

372
00:25:37,144 --> 00:25:39,015
while he was
committing a murder.

373
00:25:39,146 --> 00:25:41,757
[chuckles]
They all get caught
in the long run.

374
00:25:43,977 --> 00:25:45,152
Sometimes
it takes a while,

375
00:25:45,282 --> 00:25:46,849
but it's not because
they're so smart.

376
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:48,068
It's because the cops
are so stupid.

377
00:25:48,198 --> 00:25:49,765
[tires squealing]

378
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:01,690
Pow.
Right between the eyes.

379
00:26:07,696 --> 00:26:10,220
But the young ones, oh,
they're the best to eat.

380
00:26:12,266 --> 00:26:14,398
Done much
hunting lately?

381
00:26:14,529 --> 00:26:16,662
No. My eyesight
isn't what it used to be.

382
00:26:20,317 --> 00:26:21,971
But I think about it
an awful lot.

383
00:26:25,671 --> 00:26:28,151
[woman] He says I made him
the way that he is.

384
00:26:28,282 --> 00:26:30,414
Can you believe that?

385
00:26:30,545 --> 00:26:33,026
You can't make somebody
the way that they are.

386
00:26:33,156 --> 00:26:35,202
They got to be
born that way.

387
00:26:35,332 --> 00:26:36,812
[Lucca] What kind of car
does he drive?

388
00:26:36,943 --> 00:26:38,031
He's got
a bunch of them.

389
00:26:38,161 --> 00:26:39,772
I can't
tell them apart.

390
00:26:39,902 --> 00:26:41,034
He keeps them
up at his trailer.

391
00:26:45,516 --> 00:26:46,735
[Brownlee] What are these for?

392
00:26:46,866 --> 00:26:47,823
Depression.

393
00:26:47,954 --> 00:26:50,565
But he'd never take them.

394
00:26:50,696 --> 00:26:52,436
Well, let's see,
Mr. Warden was arrested

395
00:26:52,567 --> 00:26:54,134
because he was
following around
some cheerleader,

396
00:26:54,264 --> 00:26:55,526
really harassing her.

397
00:26:55,657 --> 00:26:56,963
So her boyfriend
and a couple
of his buddies

398
00:26:57,093 --> 00:26:58,529
confronted him
after school,

399
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:00,357
and he put them
in the hospital.

400
00:27:00,488 --> 00:27:01,837
The judge sees
no previous offenses,

401
00:27:01,968 --> 00:27:03,230
so he pops him
on probation

402
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,624
and court-appointed
counseling.

403
00:27:05,754 --> 00:27:08,061
[Lucca] That sounds
pretty smart to me.

404
00:27:08,191 --> 00:27:10,933
Ah, he's very intelligent
in a basic sort of way.

405
00:27:11,064 --> 00:27:13,109
I think he might be
a developing sociopath.

406
00:27:19,376 --> 00:27:21,814
[woman] You know, you can
never let him know
that I called you.

407
00:27:24,033 --> 00:27:25,948
He talks about
those murders
all the time.

408
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:28,995
He's... He's obsessed
with them.

409
00:27:29,125 --> 00:27:31,127
[Brownlee]
That doesn't really mean
anything, ma'am.

410
00:27:31,258 --> 00:27:34,087
And he looks
just like that drawing.

411
00:27:34,217 --> 00:27:37,656
Ah, it's quite rare
to encounter
the genuine article.

412
00:27:37,786 --> 00:27:41,137
The complete lack
of any real human emotion.

413
00:27:41,268 --> 00:27:45,794
Nothing but a series of
what we like to call
masks of normalcy.

414
00:27:45,925 --> 00:27:49,885
There's a theory developing
that sociopathic behavior
is controlled

415
00:27:50,016 --> 00:27:51,844
by a specific section
of the brain.

416
00:27:51,974 --> 00:27:53,106
It's called
the limbic region.

417
00:27:54,542 --> 00:27:55,935
It's the primitive part
of the brain

418
00:27:56,065 --> 00:27:57,414
that generates
and controls

419
00:27:57,545 --> 00:28:00,679
what we like to call
human emotion.

420
00:28:00,809 --> 00:28:02,942
Do you mind
if we keep
looking around?

421
00:28:03,072 --> 00:28:05,509
Look, I don't care
what you do. Okay?

422
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,033
He's your problem now.

423
00:28:09,426 --> 00:28:12,125
Is he capable of murder?

424
00:28:12,255 --> 00:28:14,301
I don't know
what he's capable of.

425
00:28:31,405 --> 00:28:32,711
Man, open
a goddamn window.

426
00:28:34,103 --> 00:28:35,844
Smells like
something died
in there.

427
00:28:38,847 --> 00:28:40,196
[Lucca]
You take the inside,
I'll take the out.

428
00:28:40,327 --> 00:28:41,371
Thanks.

429
00:28:49,989 --> 00:28:51,773
I wish I had some gloves.

430
00:29:09,008 --> 00:29:09,835
[Brownlee] Hey, Jon...

431
00:29:13,708 --> 00:29:14,883
[Lucca] What a diet.

432
00:29:48,525 --> 00:29:49,918
Excuse me, what's
going on here?

433
00:29:50,049 --> 00:29:51,441
I'm Detective Lucca.

434
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:55,271
I know who you are.

435
00:29:55,402 --> 00:29:57,099
I saw you on the news.

436
00:29:59,145 --> 00:30:00,407
I have
a search warrant here

437
00:30:00,537 --> 00:30:02,975
for your trailer,
your vehicle,
and your person.

438
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:04,628
Why?

439
00:30:04,759 --> 00:30:06,326
We're investigating
a murder.

440
00:30:07,675 --> 00:30:08,937
Murder?

441
00:30:10,765 --> 00:30:12,332
Okay, go ahead.

442
00:30:12,462 --> 00:30:13,812
I'll check the car.

443
00:30:17,119 --> 00:30:18,425
I've written
this sentence.

444
00:30:20,731 --> 00:30:22,124
Rewrite it, please.

445
00:30:22,255 --> 00:30:24,170
Five times quickly.

446
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:25,388
One after another,
please.

447
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:27,477
Five times? Why?

448
00:30:27,608 --> 00:30:29,305
Do the best you can.

449
00:30:36,747 --> 00:30:39,315
You think I'm the guy
that killed those kids?

450
00:30:39,446 --> 00:30:40,969
If you don't mind.

451
00:30:46,148 --> 00:30:47,846
I can't believe this.

452
00:30:54,156 --> 00:30:55,418
I don't think
I can do it.

453
00:30:55,549 --> 00:30:57,507
I thought
you caught that guy.

454
00:30:57,638 --> 00:31:01,642
If you're not involved,
this'll prove it.

455
00:31:01,772 --> 00:31:03,122
You can go.

456
00:31:09,998 --> 00:31:12,653
What's with the dead animals
in the refrigerator?

457
00:31:12,783 --> 00:31:14,698
Oh, I'm working
on a degree.

458
00:31:14,829 --> 00:31:17,005
They're part of
my scientific research.

459
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:21,401
I have a permit
for that.

460
00:31:22,532 --> 00:31:24,143
[Lucca] You like to hunt?

461
00:31:24,273 --> 00:31:25,231
Sometimes.

462
00:31:25,361 --> 00:31:26,493
Just a hobby.

463
00:31:26,623 --> 00:31:28,103
What do you hunt?

464
00:31:28,234 --> 00:31:31,498
[sighs] Depends.
Uh, raccoons, deer...

465
00:31:32,847 --> 00:31:34,153
Whatever's in season.

466
00:31:35,545 --> 00:31:37,721
Have you done
any hunting lately?

467
00:31:37,852 --> 00:31:39,201
No. I've been
studying for finals.

468
00:31:43,684 --> 00:31:46,469
Thank you.

469
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,471
[Brownlee]
Do you mind taking
a ride with us, Mr. Warden?

470
00:31:48,602 --> 00:31:50,212
Wait a minute!

471
00:31:50,343 --> 00:31:52,519
I thought all I had
to do was write
what you asked me.

472
00:31:52,649 --> 00:31:54,782
Hey, Lloyd.
What the hell...

473
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:59,221
I can't have cops
coming in here.
It don't look good.

474
00:31:59,352 --> 00:32:01,136
She said you scared
the shit out of her.

475
00:32:01,267 --> 00:32:02,703
She didn't give me
the details.

476
00:32:02,833 --> 00:32:04,531
She was too afraid to.

477
00:32:04,661 --> 00:32:06,576
Look, my mom's
afraid of the milkman.

478
00:32:13,714 --> 00:32:16,804
She said you were sick,
that I should watch you.

479
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:18,632
She wouldn't
say that about me.

480
00:32:18,762 --> 00:32:20,242
She loves me,
and I love her.

481
00:32:20,373 --> 00:32:21,548
That's exactly
what she said to me.

482
00:32:23,767 --> 00:32:27,249
Now, why would
your mother tell me
something like that?

483
00:32:38,217 --> 00:32:39,435
Because she...

484
00:32:41,742 --> 00:32:43,439
Because she's sick.

485
00:32:44,397 --> 00:32:45,354
You met her.

486
00:32:46,921 --> 00:32:48,357
That's why
I live with her.

487
00:32:48,488 --> 00:32:50,098
Because I have
to take care of her.

488
00:32:57,584 --> 00:32:59,586
How about the incident
with the cheerleader?

489
00:33:02,893 --> 00:33:05,461
That was self-defense.

490
00:33:05,592 --> 00:33:07,333
The girl smiles at me,
and the next thing I know

491
00:33:07,463 --> 00:33:09,988
her boyfriends are ganging up
on me with baseball bats.

492
00:33:12,599 --> 00:33:14,296
Where'd you get those?

493
00:33:14,427 --> 00:33:16,429
Your mother.

494
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:19,301
She says you're obsessed
with the murders.

495
00:33:19,432 --> 00:33:22,304
I'm not obsessed,
I'm just interested,
that's all.

496
00:33:22,435 --> 00:33:23,479
A lot of people are.

497
00:33:24,567 --> 00:33:26,352
I know the strain
that you're under,

498
00:33:26,482 --> 00:33:28,180
with everybody depending
on you to catch this nut,

499
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:30,399
but I'm not a killer!

500
00:33:30,530 --> 00:33:32,010
This is all just
a big mistake!

501
00:33:33,576 --> 00:33:36,753
No match. It's not him.
Sorry.

502
00:33:36,884 --> 00:33:38,538
He couldn't
have disguised
his handwriting?

503
00:33:38,668 --> 00:33:40,366
I've never
seen it done.

504
00:33:40,496 --> 00:33:42,324
It'd be very difficult,
if not impossible.

505
00:33:49,810 --> 00:33:51,855
[Lucca] Shit.

506
00:33:51,986 --> 00:33:54,684
[Brownlee]
I want to bust this guy
as bad as you do.

507
00:33:54,815 --> 00:33:57,470
He's weird, that's all.

508
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,385
And there's no law
against being weird.

509
00:35:13,067 --> 00:35:14,808
I met the killer today.

510
00:35:17,506 --> 00:35:20,248
His name is
Lloyd Carl Warden.

511
00:35:22,729 --> 00:35:24,252
I couldn't bust him.
I couldn't do anything.

512
00:35:25,384 --> 00:35:26,515
He's smart.

513
00:35:29,736 --> 00:35:32,782
He lays this
fat mama's boy
trip on everybody.

514
00:35:36,046 --> 00:35:37,744
What makes you
so sure it's him?

515
00:35:43,924 --> 00:35:45,621
I saw it in his eyes.

516
00:36:07,034 --> 00:36:08,296
He knew me.

517
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:12,866
What do you mean,
he "knew" you?

518
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:17,262
When I confronted him...
I knew, he knew.

519
00:36:18,437 --> 00:36:19,742
I know he knows.

520
00:36:23,006 --> 00:36:24,312
When did you start
smoking again?

521
00:36:24,443 --> 00:36:25,618
About 4:30.

694
00:48:07,885 --> 00:48:10,278
we'll never hear
the end of it.

695
00:48:10,409 --> 00:48:13,064
For now, we deny
that any of our men
ever talked to him.

696
00:48:13,194 --> 00:48:14,630
It didn't happen.

697
00:48:14,761 --> 00:48:16,023
There won't
be a bomb.

698
00:48:16,154 --> 00:48:17,590
How the hell
do you know?

699
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:19,113
[Lucca] Because it's
not his style.

700
00:48:19,244 --> 00:48:20,593
He's just
fucking with us.

701
00:48:20,723 --> 00:48:24,249
A scare tactic.
It's a game.

702
00:48:24,379 --> 00:48:26,251
We don't want
to throw everybody
into a panic.

703
00:48:26,381 --> 00:48:27,730
Quit telling us
what he's going
or not going to do.

704
00:48:27,861 --> 00:48:29,384
You're no closer
to this than any of us.

705
00:48:29,515 --> 00:48:31,169
-[Payne] All right, all right.
-Go fuck yourself.

706
00:48:31,299 --> 00:48:32,518
He's lost all objectivity
on this case.

707
00:48:32,648 --> 00:48:33,519
He's starting to sound
like a frigging shrink.

708
00:48:33,649 --> 00:48:35,129
All right.

709
00:48:36,261 --> 00:48:38,263
No, Jon, Jon!
Jon, Jon!

710
00:48:38,393 --> 00:48:39,960
Watch out! Watch out!

711
00:48:40,091 --> 00:48:41,701
[Brownlee] Come on, guys!
This isn't going
to do anything!

712
00:48:41,831 --> 00:48:43,094
Knock it off!

713
00:48:43,224 --> 00:48:44,704
No! Let me go!

714
00:48:44,834 --> 00:48:46,358
[Brownlee] Come on!

Let me go!

717
00:48:51,276 --> 00:48:52,320

your values
as a human being,

00:49:05,333 --> 00:49:07,509
as you slip into
the sick fuck
who did it.

722
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:08,858
Pulled the trigger
10 times,

723
00:49:08,989 --> 00:49:11,426
or slashed and tore
with a cold blade.

724
00:49:11,557 --> 00:49:13,515
Spilled the blood,
and still walking
around.

725
00:49:13,646 --> 00:49:15,300
That's the hard part.

726
00:49:17,519 --> 00:49:20,174
You know, it's against
the law to drive
with an open container.

Go on in there and
finish your breakfast.

It's really gross.

What's going on?

00:50:17,492 --> 00:50:19,494
[Ann] Girls, I want you
to go upstairs
and get your homework.

Now, okay? Go.

What the fuck's
going on?
Who put it in the paper?

00:50:23,933 --> 00:50:25,631
Why didn't I see it?

743
00:50:25,761 --> 00:50:26,849
You're driving them
to school.

744
00:50:26,980 --> 00:50:29,156
I don't want to talk
about it anymore.

745
00:50:29,287 --> 00:50:30,549
I'll be there in an hour.

[Ann] Jenny, are you
skating today?

-[Jennifer] Yeah.
-[Ann] Get your skates.

748
00:50:33,508 --> 00:50:34,596
[Jennifer] I'm brushing
my hair!

749
00:50:34,727 --> 00:50:36,990
Okay, I got your skates.
Come on, quick!

750
00:50:37,121 --> 00:50:39,775
Look it, he's not going
to be killing kids
getting off a school bus.

751
00:50:39,906 --> 00:50:41,821
You and everybody else
are doing exactly
what he wants.

752
00:50:41,951 --> 00:50:43,344
Oh, yeah?

753
00:50:43,475 --> 00:50:44,911
That's right.

754
00:50:45,042 --> 00:50:46,913
He's rattling
everybody's cage.

755
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:49,176
He's getting off
on the attention.

756
00:50:49,307 --> 00:50:53,615
And you are willing to risk
your own kids' lives
that you're right.

757
00:50:53,746 --> 00:50:56,705
Jon, this psycho
has been getting away
with killing people

758
00:50:56,836 --> 00:50:58,794
and writing you
about it for years.

759
00:50:58,925 --> 00:51:01,275
Maybe he's talking
about Jennifer and Suzy
specifically.

760
00:51:01,406 --> 00:51:02,842
I can't take that chance.

761
00:51:02,972 --> 00:51:05,497
"I shall no longer announce
when I commit my murders.

762
00:51:05,627 --> 00:51:09,022
They shall look like
routine incidents."

763
00:51:09,153 --> 00:51:11,068
Maybe then you can forget
this whole damn thing.

764
00:51:11,198 --> 00:51:14,375
"Only you, Jon, will know
when I do my thing."

765
00:51:14,506 --> 00:51:16,595
He's dumping
the whole thing
back on me.

You know, you are
scaring me, Jon.

767
00:51:18,379 --> 00:51:19,163
You're scaring me to death.

00:51:21,730 --> 00:51:23,341
Take it easy, okay?

770
00:51:26,735 --> 00:51:29,477
You don't even see
what you're doing
to this family, do you?

771
00:51:29,608 --> 00:51:31,088
Girls, come on!
Right away!

772
00:51:47,843 --> 00:51:49,584
Are you going
to be late again?

773
00:51:49,715 --> 00:51:51,369
No. I'm going to try
to get home early.

774
00:51:51,499 --> 00:51:52,761
-Great.
-Good.

775
00:51:52,892 --> 00:51:53,893
You guys have
a good day, all right?

776
00:51:54,023 --> 00:51:55,242
-Okay. Bye.
-Bye, Dad.

777
00:51:55,373 --> 00:51:56,243
Bye!

778
00:52:00,204 --> 00:52:03,685
-Hey, Jon.
-Hey, Harry.
How are you?

779
00:52:03,816 --> 00:52:05,339
When are you going
to do something
about this nut?

780
00:52:05,470 --> 00:52:07,428
He's making us all
a little jumpy.

781
00:52:07,559 --> 00:52:09,517
Harry, is
that gun loaded?

782
00:52:09,648 --> 00:52:10,823
Of course
it's loaded.

783
00:52:10,953 --> 00:52:11,867
What good's
an unloaded gun?

784
00:52:11,998 --> 00:52:13,913
Give it to me.

785
00:52:14,043 --> 00:52:15,436
Everybody's
packing something.

786
00:52:17,090 --> 00:52:20,006
I know.
Just give it to me.

787
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:23,531
Shit, man, you know
I'm basically
a nonviolent person,

788
00:52:23,662 --> 00:52:26,055
but when people start
shooting at my kids,
I'm shooting back.

789
00:52:26,186 --> 00:52:27,883
I don't blame you.
Now give it to me.

790
00:52:28,014 --> 00:52:29,842
I'll return it to your house.
I'll come by and visit.

791

I'll be by, all right?

792
00:52:41,941 --> 00:52:42,942
Shit.

793
00:52:55,041 --> 00:52:56,303
Hi, Kathy.
How you doing?

794
00:52:57,522 --> 00:52:58,566
You want
the usual?

795
00:53:01,874 --> 00:53:03,223
Yes, please.

796
00:53:24,244 --> 00:53:26,377
Can I have a cup
of coffee, please?

797
00:53:26,507 --> 00:53:29,554
To go.
Cream and sugar.

798
00:53:32,861 --> 00:53:34,428
Stop hounding me.

799
00:53:35,603 --> 00:53:37,344
Thank you.

800
00:53:37,475 --> 00:53:39,868
I don't have to answer
your questions anymore,
and you know it.

801
00:53:39,999 --> 00:53:41,435
And I'm sick and tired
of losing jobs

802
00:53:41,566 --> 00:53:43,524
and having people
afraid of me

803
00:53:43,655 --> 00:53:46,571
because of the questions
you ask them about me.

804
00:53:46,701 --> 00:53:47,702
I'm sorry
about that, Lloyd.

805
00:53:50,618 --> 00:53:51,837
I just want you
to remember one thing.

around, there's you!

Why are you
doing this to me?

Why are you trying
to ruin my life?

00:54:17,645 --> 00:54:20,039
Will you stop
hounding me,
God damn it?

817

Stop hounding me!

He's claiming for physical
and psychological damages.

you know we can't go
into court on a hunch.

admissible evidence.

yourself ulcers.

no doubt about that,
but he's clean.

He's got no way
out of there.

862
00:56:59,590 --> 00:57:01,113
-Is he in here?
-Yeah, in the middle
of that one.

863
00:57:01,243 --> 00:57:03,202
Careful,
he might go off.

864
00:57:03,332 --> 00:57:04,856
What the hell are
you doing here?

865
00:57:04,986 --> 00:57:06,988
Just here to share
in the glory you
don't deserve?

866
00:57:07,119 --> 00:57:09,730
-[man] Anybody comes
in here, she's dead!
-[woman] No!

867
00:57:09,861 --> 00:57:10,905
-Jon!
-My God!

868
00:57:11,036 --> 00:57:12,472
[woman crying]

869
00:57:16,215 --> 00:57:17,695
Who the fuck
are you?

870
00:57:17,825 --> 00:57:19,348
-[Brownlee] Damn!
-[woman] Please help me!

871
00:57:19,479 --> 00:57:21,307
-[Lucca] Who the fuck are you?
-You know
who the fuck I am.

872
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:23,352
[Lucca] No, I don't know
who you are.
Who are you?

873
00:57:23,483 --> 00:57:25,833
I'm the fuckin'
Scorekeeper, man!

874
00:57:25,964 --> 00:57:27,313
-The hell you are, buddy!
-If you don't get me
out of here safe

875
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:28,967
and put that gun
down now,

876
00:57:29,097 --> 00:57:31,099
I'm going to blow
this bitch away.

877
00:57:31,796 --> 00:57:32,884
Move it!

878
00:57:34,015 --> 00:57:36,844
All right.
Here you go.

879
00:57:36,975 --> 00:57:38,280
Get the gun away
from her head.

880
00:57:38,411 --> 00:57:39,586
-No way!
-Help me.

881
00:57:39,717 --> 00:57:41,109
All right,
get the gun away
from her head.

882
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:42,763
Put it down now!

883
00:57:44,025 --> 00:57:46,506
All right.

884
00:57:46,637 --> 00:57:49,727
You're some lonely
piece of shit
looking for attention.

885
00:57:49,857 --> 00:57:52,033
-Who the fuck is this guy?
-Come on...

886
00:57:52,164 --> 00:57:53,208
Get him
out of here now,

887
00:57:53,339 --> 00:57:55,602
or I'll blow her
away, I mean it!

888
00:57:57,778 --> 00:57:59,214
You know what?

889
00:57:59,345 --> 00:58:00,955
I don't think you
ever killed anybody.

890
00:58:01,086 --> 00:58:02,348
I don't think you
ever killed anybody
in your life.

891
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:04,132
You wouldn't
know a thing!

892
00:58:04,263 --> 00:58:06,221
-You've never killed
anybody in your life.
-I'll kill this bitch now!

893
00:58:06,352 --> 00:58:07,962
You ain't gonna start now.
You ain't got
the balls for it.

894
00:58:08,093 --> 00:58:09,181
-Get that gun away!
-I'm going to do it!

895
00:58:09,311 --> 00:58:10,791
Get that fucking gun...

896
00:58:12,097 --> 00:58:13,141
[woman screaming]

897
00:58:14,795 --> 00:58:16,057
[all clamoring]

898
00:58:19,191 --> 00:58:22,673
Upon searching the deceased
suspect's apartment, we found
a cache of weapons,

899
00:58:22,803 --> 00:58:24,370
including a .357 Magnum

900
00:58:24,501 --> 00:58:25,980
which we believe
might've been

901
00:58:26,111 --> 00:58:28,330
the weapon used
in the Scorekeeper murders.

902
00:58:28,461 --> 00:58:30,942
Ballistic tests
are currently underway.

903
00:58:31,072 --> 00:58:33,422
Also recovered were maps
and newspaper clippings

904
00:58:33,553 --> 00:58:35,773
related to
the Scorekeeper murders.

905
00:58:35,903 --> 00:58:37,949
As of this time,
we are confident

906
00:58:38,079 --> 00:58:39,690
that we've put an end
to his reign of terror.

907
00:58:41,256 --> 00:58:43,345
Lieutenant Lucca
is in good condition.

908
00:58:43,476 --> 00:58:45,826
We are all
very thankful to him
for his bravery.

909
00:58:46,784 --> 00:58:48,089
[all clamoring]

910
00:58:58,056 --> 00:58:59,361
"Having
a not-so-wonderful time.

911
00:58:59,492 --> 00:59:02,234
Wish you were here,
Ron and George and Michael."

912
00:59:16,857 --> 00:59:17,815
Look.

913
00:59:18,467 --> 00:59:20,339
Okay.

914
00:59:20,469 --> 00:59:22,776
Things are
coming along nicely.

915
00:59:22,907 --> 00:59:23,995
The muscle tissue
that the bullet hit

916
00:59:24,125 --> 00:59:25,866
is healing nicely,
as is the wound.

917
00:59:25,997 --> 00:59:27,825
You should be
out of here in no time.

918
00:59:27,955 --> 00:59:30,131
However, we have
found something

919
00:59:30,262 --> 00:59:33,047
that concerns me
greatly.

920
00:59:33,178 --> 00:59:36,311
You are developing some
nasty-looking ulcers,
Detective Lucca.

921
00:59:36,442 --> 00:59:38,879
What it boils down to is that
you are going to have to

922
00:59:39,010 --> 00:59:41,229
drastically change
your lifestyle.

923
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:43,275
You got to quit drinking,
quit smoking.

924
00:59:43,405 --> 00:59:44,668
You should probably
quit your job.

925
00:59:44,798 --> 00:59:47,105
At the very least,
you should take
a vacation.

926
00:59:50,412 --> 00:59:53,154
Girls, be careful
you don't slip.
The deck is wet.

927
00:59:53,285 --> 00:59:54,939
Careful. Come on,
guys, help.

928
00:59:55,069 --> 00:59:57,245
-I caught you back.
-Did not!

929
00:59:58,203 --> 00:59:59,465
Please...

930
00:59:59,596 --> 01:00:01,162
You guys just
help us, please?

931
01:00:01,293 --> 01:00:02,642
Oh, gross!

932
01:00:04,644 --> 01:00:06,472
-I bet he's got a hard-on.
-Hey.

933
01:00:06,603 --> 01:00:07,778
-You're it.
-No, you're it.

934
01:00:07,908 --> 01:00:08,909
Help me,
come on, come on.

935
01:00:19,006 --> 01:00:20,007
Hey!

936
01:00:20,834 --> 01:00:21,922
Hey!

937
01:00:22,967 --> 01:00:23,837
Hey!

938
01:00:28,189 --> 01:00:29,277
Jon.

939
01:00:30,322 --> 01:00:31,540
Jon?

940
01:00:31,671 --> 01:00:33,673
You're scaring
the girls. Please.

941
01:00:43,030 --> 01:00:46,947
You know,
it was another woman.

942
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:51,430
You know,

943
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:55,260
something I could
read about in <i>Cosmo...</i>

944
01:00:59,046 --> 01:01:01,658
Lament to
my girlfriends about.

945
01:01:05,879 --> 01:01:07,881
If I could,

946
01:01:08,012 --> 01:01:09,448
if I didn't
have the girls...

947
01:01:12,625 --> 01:01:14,671
I'd blow his brains out.

948
01:01:16,020 --> 01:01:17,195
I swear to God
I would.

949
01:01:20,328 --> 01:01:22,896
Just to put an end
to all of this,
just to...

950
01:01:25,464 --> 01:01:26,987
Get you back.

951
01:01:29,555 --> 01:01:30,991
[thunder rumbling]

952
01:01:35,517 --> 01:01:37,694
[Brownlee] They want to
give all of us citations.

953
01:01:41,349 --> 01:01:42,481
What for?

954
01:01:44,613 --> 01:01:46,703
We know
the guy you shot
wasn't him.

955
01:01:48,443 --> 01:01:52,056
As far
as I'm concerned,
it was him.

956
01:01:52,186 --> 01:01:53,971
[refilling glass]

957
01:01:54,101 --> 01:01:55,146
It's over,
and I'm glad it is.

958
01:02:03,415 --> 01:02:04,503
I've decided
to leave Homicide.

959
01:02:07,506 --> 01:02:08,725
I've seen
what this case
has done to you,

960
01:02:08,855 --> 01:02:12,380
and I'm not going to
let it happen to me.

961
01:02:12,511 --> 01:02:15,644
If I was you,
I'd start thinking
about doing the same thing.

962
01:02:17,385 --> 01:02:20,040
You and I have seen
enough dead bodies
to last a lifetime.

963
01:02:21,346 --> 01:02:22,477
What are you
going to do?

964
01:02:25,219 --> 01:02:26,786
Vice might be fun.

965
01:02:28,266 --> 01:02:30,137
Then again,

966
01:02:30,268 --> 01:02:31,922
pawnshop detail
would be okay, too.

967
01:02:32,531 --> 01:02:34,011
[both chuckling]

968
01:02:34,141 --> 01:02:35,099

[Ann grunting]

970
01:02:40,495 --> 01:02:42,149
Jon? Uh...

971
01:02:49,156 --> 01:02:50,114
Ow!

972
01:02:56,207 --> 01:02:57,382
Almost...

973
01:02:57,512 --> 01:02:58,557
Honey?

974
01:02:58,687 --> 01:02:59,993
[coughs]

975
01:03:04,650 --> 01:03:06,260
I'll be all right.

976
01:03:07,435 --> 01:03:09,046
Just give me a second.

977
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:56,615
[Lucca] <i>When I was a cop,</i>

978
01:03:56,745 --> 01:03:58,182
<i>I was confronted</i><i>
all the time</i>

979
01:03:58,312 --> 01:03:59,618
<i>by people</i><i>
who absolutely knew</i>

980
01:03:59,748 --> 01:04:01,446
<i>the killer</i><i>
of someone they loved.</i>

981
01:04:02,795 --> 01:04:04,753
But they
couldn't prove it.

982
01:04:04,884 --> 01:04:06,494
The killer
was going to get away.

983
01:04:07,669 --> 01:04:10,324
They wanted to run over
the bastard

984
01:04:10,455 --> 01:04:12,370
and walk out of the dark
and blow him away.

985
01:04:14,154 --> 01:04:15,895
But I always
talked them out of it.

986
01:04:17,854 --> 01:04:19,290
<i>And that night,</i><i>
there I was,</i>

987
01:04:19,420 --> 01:04:21,466
<i>so close to blowing</i><i>
your brains out.</i>

988
01:04:22,510 --> 01:04:24,164
And getting away
with it.

989
01:04:27,211 --> 01:04:28,429
How'd it feel
to be so close

990
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:30,040
to losing control
like that?

991
01:04:33,217 --> 01:04:34,609
To be that close
to destroying

992
01:04:34,740 --> 01:04:36,611
everything you
believe in, huh?

993
01:04:36,742 --> 01:04:38,396
-How did that
make you feel?
-Hmm...

994
01:04:42,791 --> 01:04:44,184
I felt sick.

995
01:04:46,360 --> 01:04:48,275
But only because
I couldn't do it.

996
01:05:14,562 --> 01:05:15,476
[gasps]

997
01:05:17,391 --> 01:05:18,392
What are you doing?

998
01:05:18,523 --> 01:05:20,177
Dad! Oh...

999
01:05:20,307 --> 01:05:21,482
What are you doing here?
Are you out of your mind?

1000
01:05:21,613 --> 01:05:22,831
You're the one
who's out of his mind!

1001
01:05:22,962 --> 01:05:24,529
What are you doing,
following me?

1002
01:05:24,659 --> 01:05:26,313
Hey, Mr. Lucca,
it was my fault.

1003
01:05:27,358 --> 01:05:30,274
Both of you,
what, are you crazy?

1004
01:05:30,404 --> 01:05:31,405
Don't you
understand something?

1005
01:05:31,884 --> 01:05:33,407
You see this?

1006
01:05:33,538 --> 01:05:35,453
This could've been
on the other side
of the flashlight.

1007
01:05:35,583 --> 01:05:37,890
Do you understand me?

1008
01:05:38,021 --> 01:05:40,501
This could've been
the last thing you guys saw.

1009
01:05:40,632 --> 01:05:41,502
Do you get it?

1010
01:05:42,634 --> 01:05:44,462
Now get my daughter home.

1011
01:05:45,854 --> 01:05:47,160
Get out of here!

1012
01:06:17,190 --> 01:06:18,583
Jennifer, wake up.

1013
01:06:20,367 --> 01:06:22,195
Jennifer, get up
and go to your bed.

1014
01:06:22,326 --> 01:06:23,718
Go to bed, honey.

1015
01:06:26,417 --> 01:06:27,984
If I catch you
in that situation again,

1016
01:06:28,897 --> 01:06:30,595
you'll be very sorry.

1017
01:06:34,164 --> 01:06:36,470
Jon, is there a place
where this is
ever going to stop?

1018
01:06:39,604 --> 01:06:43,434
I don't want this
in my house anymore.

1019
01:06:45,392 --> 01:06:46,524
You have chosen
to let this thing

1020
01:06:46,654 --> 01:06:49,353
destroy everything
we had.

1021
01:06:51,398 --> 01:06:52,443
Every time
you walk in the door,

1022
01:06:52,573 --> 01:06:53,705
that monster
comes in with you.

1023
01:06:56,664 --> 01:06:59,580
You're sick, Jon,
and I don't know
how to help you.

1024
01:07:01,974 --> 01:07:04,324
I don't want this
anymore.

1025
01:07:11,331 --> 01:07:12,637
I'll move out.

1026
01:07:20,340 --> 01:07:21,646
[laughing]

1027
01:07:22,516 --> 01:07:23,735
Oh, yeah.

1028
01:07:27,521 --> 01:07:29,393
What's so funny,
Marshal?

1029
01:07:29,523 --> 01:07:30,829
Ah, ain't this
a pretty picture.

1030
01:07:34,876 --> 01:07:38,532
That is the motherfucker
that beat me so bad
I lost my right nut.

1031
01:07:38,663 --> 01:07:39,794
His wife got him.

1032
01:07:39,925 --> 01:07:41,274
Ain't that
fucking beautiful?

1033
01:07:41,405 --> 01:07:42,754
I'm going
to take this home

1034
01:07:42,884 --> 01:07:44,103
and put it
on my mantel.

1035
01:07:47,498 --> 01:07:49,282
[people chattering]

1036
01:08:04,384 --> 01:08:05,342
Who the fuck
are you?

1037
01:08:05,472 --> 01:08:06,647
FBI.

1038
01:08:06,778 --> 01:08:08,388
[Payne] Wait, wait, Lucca!

1039
01:08:08,519 --> 01:08:09,650
They are the FBI.

1040
01:08:09,781 --> 01:08:10,695
They're moving
all the files

1041
01:08:10,825 --> 01:08:11,913
to their office
in Sacramento.

1042
01:08:12,044 --> 01:08:13,611
Not my files.

1043
01:08:13,741 --> 01:08:15,091
Hey, look, we're
on the same side
here, all right?

1044
01:08:16,918 --> 01:08:18,485
Hey, come on,
come on, let him go.

1045
01:08:18,616 --> 01:08:20,400
Get off of him!

1046
01:08:20,531 --> 01:08:22,750
[Lucca] That's my life!
That's my life!

1047
01:08:24,535 --> 01:08:26,145
Cool, Lucca. Come on.

1048
01:08:26,711 --> 01:08:28,104
Let him up.

1049
01:08:38,679 --> 01:08:39,898
Fuck you.

1050
01:08:43,554 --> 01:08:46,209
Don't do this, Jon.

1051
01:08:46,339 --> 01:08:49,734
[Lucca] <i>So finally everything</i><i>
had been cut out of my life.</i>

1052
01:08:49,864 --> 01:08:51,736
<i>Everything but him.</i>

1053
01:08:51,866 --> 01:08:53,520
-[coughing]
-He knew he had me.

1054
01:08:55,131 --> 01:08:56,871
<i>He knew</i><i>
I'd be out there,</i><i>
his captive audience.</i>

1055
01:08:59,004 --> 01:09:02,442
<i>I'd walk out onto</i><i>
scene after scene</i><i>
of his sickness.</i>

1056
01:09:02,573 --> 01:09:04,270
<i>No one would know</i><i>
that he'd done it.</i>

1057
01:09:06,142 --> 01:09:08,318
He involved me somehow,

1058
01:09:08,448 --> 01:09:09,580
made me feel like
I was his...

1059
01:09:09,710 --> 01:09:10,885
Conscience?

1060
01:09:11,799 --> 01:09:13,801
Keep everyone out.

1061
01:09:13,932 --> 01:09:17,109
[Lucca] <i>The list grew,</i><i>
but only I knew it.</i>

1062
01:09:17,240 --> 01:09:18,763
<i>All I could do</i><i>
was wait and watch,</i>

1063
01:09:20,068 --> 01:09:22,245
<i>and try to be there</i><i>
when he fucked up.</i>

1064
01:09:23,855 --> 01:09:25,596
<i>Just the two of us now.</i>

1065
01:10:25,612 --> 01:10:27,223
What the fuck
are you doing here?

1066
01:10:30,748 --> 01:10:32,576
[Fredricks] "This is
the Scorekeeper speaking,
comma,

1067
01:10:32,706 --> 01:10:34,621
I am back with you, period.

1068
01:10:34,752 --> 01:10:37,494
That city dick Lucca,
dot, dot, dot...

1069
01:10:37,624 --> 01:10:40,584
That ex-city dick
Lucca was good, comma,

1070
01:10:40,714 --> 01:10:43,064
but I am smarter
and better, period.

1071
01:10:43,195 --> 01:10:45,415
I am waiting
for a good movie
about me, period.

1072
01:10:45,545 --> 01:10:47,243
Who will play me? Period.

1073
01:10:47,373 --> 01:10:49,897
I am now in control
of all things, period.

1074
01:10:50,028 --> 01:10:53,727
Yours truly...
Me: Guess. You: zero."

1075
01:10:53,858 --> 01:10:55,773
I've reluctantly held
this press conference

1076
01:10:55,903 --> 01:10:59,211
because this letter
had somehow been
leaked to the press.

1077
01:10:59,342 --> 01:11:02,214
It has been examined
by the LAPD, the FBI,

1078
01:11:02,345 --> 01:11:04,216
as well as our own
handwriting experts.

1079
01:11:04,347 --> 01:11:05,783
All have agreed
the letter is a forgery.

1080
01:11:06,305 --> 01:11:07,785
[all groan]

1081
01:11:07,915 --> 01:11:09,177
[reporter] You saying
the letter is a fake?

1082
01:11:09,308 --> 01:11:12,659
We don't want or need
to create anymore
unneeded hysteria.

1083
01:11:12,790 --> 01:11:15,836
This case was solved
and closed years ago.

1084
01:11:15,967 --> 01:11:17,664
This press conference
is over.

1085
01:11:17,795 --> 01:11:18,883
[all clamoring]

1086
01:11:23,453 --> 01:11:26,107
[reporter] If the Scorekeeper
didn't write it,
then who did?

1087
01:11:26,238 --> 01:11:27,935
The letter was
manufactured by...

1088
01:11:29,850 --> 01:11:31,287
By someone
who knows a great deal

1089
01:11:31,417 --> 01:11:34,115
about
the background and M.O.
of the Scorekeeper.

1090
01:11:34,246 --> 01:11:35,900
Some lunatic
who gets a kick

1091
01:11:36,030 --> 01:11:37,554
out of terrorizing
the public.

1092
01:11:37,684 --> 01:11:39,251
[reporter] How do you
know he's a lunatic?

1093
01:11:39,382 --> 01:11:43,299
You know that letter
doesn't mean shit
one way or the other.

1094
01:11:43,429 --> 01:11:44,735
The guy's
still out there
killing people,

1095
01:11:44,865 --> 01:11:46,519
and you know it.

1096
01:11:48,086 --> 01:11:49,653
[all chattering]

1097
01:11:54,222 --> 01:11:55,963
You wrote that letter,
didn't you?

1098
01:12:00,664 --> 01:12:02,753
Lloyd Carl Warden
must be loving this.

1099
01:12:09,803 --> 01:12:11,718
My wife asks about you
every now and then,

1100
01:12:11,849 --> 01:12:14,112
how you're doing and all.

1101
01:12:14,242 --> 01:12:16,114
I say you're doing fine,
looking good.

1102
01:12:19,726 --> 01:12:21,641
Then I realize
I'm just lying to myself.

1103
01:12:30,041 --> 01:12:32,086
Listen, I quit
figuring things out
a long time ago.

1104
01:12:38,702 --> 01:12:40,138
You know
what Ann said once?

1105
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:46,013
She said she'd blow
the fucker's brains out
and get it over with.

1106
01:12:48,015 --> 01:12:49,974
I wish I could do it.

1107
01:12:50,104 --> 01:12:51,976
But you know me.

1108
01:12:52,106 --> 01:12:54,108
I got to catch
the fucker.

1109
01:12:54,239 --> 01:12:55,632
I got to do it
by the book.

1110
01:12:58,243 --> 01:12:59,810
I got to be sure.

1111
01:13:02,769 --> 01:13:03,857
Then I'll blow
his fucking brains out.

1112
01:13:20,091 --> 01:13:21,005
Hmm...

1113
01:13:22,049 --> 01:13:24,443
This is the only place

1114
01:13:24,574 --> 01:13:27,141
where someone saw him
and lived to talk about it.

1115
01:13:30,188 --> 01:13:32,712
What do you mean,
"Lived to talk about it"?

1116
01:13:32,843 --> 01:13:35,149
One of the kids
lived long enough

1117
01:13:36,803 --> 01:13:37,935
to give
a description of him.

1118
01:13:40,285 --> 01:13:41,634
I never read
about that.

1119
01:13:43,201 --> 01:13:44,507
It was never
made public.

1120
01:13:46,030 --> 01:13:47,901
-[laughing]
-[girl screams in distance]

1121
01:13:50,034 --> 01:13:52,340
You hear that?

1122
01:13:52,471 --> 01:13:54,560
What, them carp
talking to you again?

1123
01:13:54,691 --> 01:13:55,996
Shut up. Listen.

1124
01:14:00,740 --> 01:14:02,263
Nah, that's an owl.

1125
01:14:02,394 --> 01:14:03,656
That ain't
no fucking owl.

1126
01:14:10,315 --> 01:14:14,101
[man] It took an hour
and a half for the ambulance
to get here.

1127
01:14:14,232 --> 01:14:17,191
She was suffering so much,
she just kept begging me

1128
01:14:17,322 --> 01:14:18,976
to put her
out of her misery.

1129
01:14:21,152 --> 01:14:22,632
She wasn't bleeding
anymore...

1130
01:14:24,503 --> 01:14:25,678
But there were
so many stab wounds,

1131
01:14:25,809 --> 01:14:27,071
I guess she just
must have...

1132
01:14:28,812 --> 01:14:30,074
She must've
run out of blood.

1133
01:14:36,167 --> 01:14:38,125
I found the boy
on the road.

1134
01:14:38,256 --> 01:14:40,519
I guess he must've
crawled from the campsite.

1135
01:14:43,566 --> 01:14:45,524
I never saw
so much blood
in all my life.

1136
01:14:57,362 --> 01:14:59,016
I kind of figured
you'd show up.

1137
01:15:02,889 --> 01:15:04,587
You want to take
a look at the girl?

1138
01:15:09,026 --> 01:15:10,288
Maybe he thought
by wearing the hood,

1139
01:15:10,418 --> 01:15:12,508
he could spend more time
with his victims.

1140
01:15:12,638 --> 01:15:14,858
You know,
create some sort
of a relationship.

1141
01:15:16,381 --> 01:15:18,557
[Lucca] Relationship?
[laughs]

1142
01:15:20,298 --> 01:15:21,691
You sick fuck.

1143
01:15:29,307 --> 01:15:31,004
I'm only speculating.

1144
01:15:34,051 --> 01:15:35,618
If you don't want my
opinion, what are
we doing here?

1145
01:15:35,748 --> 01:15:36,619
All right.

1146
01:15:39,099 --> 01:15:42,233
He puts on a hood,
walks into the woods,
finds the kids camping.

1147
01:15:43,756 --> 01:15:44,540
Then what?

1148
01:15:45,497 --> 01:15:46,933
He ties them up?

1149
01:15:47,064 --> 01:15:49,849
No, not yet.
It's too soon.

1150
01:15:49,980 --> 01:15:52,809
More than likely, he'd
start a conversation.

1151
01:15:52,939 --> 01:15:53,984
About what?

1152
01:15:54,114 --> 01:15:56,334
Who knows?
Small talk probably.

1153
01:15:56,464 --> 01:15:58,336
It must have been
very exciting for him.

1154
01:16:01,992 --> 01:16:05,561
Why would he waste
the time bullshitting?

1155
01:16:06,562 --> 01:16:08,041
He could just
kill the kids.

1156
01:16:08,172 --> 01:16:09,565
[chuckles]

1157
01:16:12,176 --> 01:16:13,220
Sick.

1158
01:16:15,048 --> 01:16:17,268
Because this time...

1159
01:16:17,398 --> 01:16:19,575
You know,
with the hood,

1160
01:16:19,705 --> 01:16:22,142
the secluded area,
He could take his time,

1161
01:16:22,273 --> 01:16:24,405
stretch it all out.
Enjoy it.

1162
01:16:24,536 --> 01:16:26,364
The possession.

1163
01:16:26,494 --> 01:16:28,279
He could stand
right next to them

1164
01:16:28,409 --> 01:16:30,368
and feel their breaths
become a part of him.

1165
01:16:32,500 --> 01:16:35,329
[girl] That's Andromeda,
the chained lady.

1166
01:16:35,460 --> 01:16:37,201
[boy] Oh, yeah?

1167
01:16:37,331 --> 01:16:39,551
Looks like a bunch
of stars to me.

1168
01:16:39,682 --> 01:16:41,901
Well, squint and use
your imagination.

1169
01:16:43,207 --> 01:16:44,817
Okay, I'm squinting.

1170
01:16:46,471 --> 01:16:47,385
Nope.

1171
01:16:47,515 --> 01:16:48,821
No lady.

1172
01:16:49,822 --> 01:16:50,997
No chains.

1173
01:16:51,128 --> 01:16:52,259
Just a bunch
of stars.

1174
01:16:53,173 --> 01:16:54,827
You're hopeless.

1175
01:16:54,958 --> 01:16:56,394
Why'd you take
astronomy, anyway?

1176
01:16:56,524 --> 01:16:58,004
I don't know.

1177
01:16:58,135 --> 01:16:59,223
Thought it'd be easy.

1178
01:16:59,353 --> 01:17:00,398
Well, plus
I needed the credits.

1179
01:17:02,443 --> 01:17:03,619
Yeah.

1180
01:17:07,927 --> 01:17:09,276
[cocks gun]

1181
01:17:16,022 --> 01:17:18,068
[man] You know how to swim?

1182
01:17:18,198 --> 01:17:19,243
Um...

1183
01:17:20,200 --> 01:17:22,202
Yeah, sure.

1184
01:17:22,333 --> 01:17:23,856
Have you ever swum
in here before?

1185
01:17:27,338 --> 01:17:28,818
No.

1186
01:17:28,948 --> 01:17:30,733
This is a man-made lake.

1187
01:17:34,084 --> 01:17:36,521
It's only 15 feet deep
in the middle.

1188
01:17:36,652 --> 01:17:38,392
Oh. I didn't know that.

1189
01:17:39,959 --> 01:17:42,135
They flooded it
20 years ago.

1190
01:17:42,266 --> 01:17:44,442
It was nothing more
than a cow pasture.

1191
01:17:45,965 --> 01:17:48,446
It used to be stocked
with trout

1192
01:17:49,577 --> 01:17:51,057
and bass.

1193
01:17:52,537 --> 01:17:54,234
And now there's

1194
01:17:54,365 --> 01:17:57,150
nothing in it
but bullhead and carp.

1195
01:17:57,281 --> 01:17:58,891
Bottom feeders.

1196
01:17:59,022 --> 01:18:00,371
Good for nothing,
really.

1197
01:18:02,634 --> 01:18:03,940
Tie the girl up.

1198
01:18:04,070 --> 01:18:05,681
What? No.

1199
01:18:07,247 --> 01:18:09,032
Now!

1200
01:18:09,162 --> 01:18:11,121
Hands behind her back.

1201
01:18:11,251 --> 01:18:13,210
It's okay, it's okay.
It's okay.

1202
01:18:13,340 --> 01:18:17,040
Just do
as he says, okay?
Just roll over, okay?

1203
01:18:17,170 --> 01:18:18,911
[breathing rapidly]

1204
01:18:19,042 --> 01:18:20,130
I'm just going
to tie you up,

1205
01:18:20,260 --> 01:18:21,305
and then
he'll leave us alone.

1206
01:18:21,435 --> 01:18:23,829
He doesn't want
to hurt us. Right?

1207
01:18:25,613 --> 01:18:26,658
Okay?

1208
01:18:26,789 --> 01:18:29,139
It's okay.
He's not going
to hurt us.

1209
01:18:30,314 --> 01:18:31,881
Get on your stomach.

1210
01:18:33,578 --> 01:18:35,014
It's okay.

1211

1213
01:18:51,204 --> 01:18:52,249
Please.

1217
01:19:04,478 --> 01:19:05,523
Ah...

1218
01:19:07,612 --> 01:19:09,527
I'm going to have
to kill you.

1219
01:19:11,137 --> 01:19:14,140
Look, I could
give you some money
or something, man!

1220
01:19:14,271 --> 01:19:17,230
You're both
going to die.

1221
01:19:18,014 --> 01:19:19,363
[screaming]

1222
01:19:25,021 --> 01:19:27,153
You did it, didn't you?

1223
01:19:29,634 --> 01:19:30,853
Jon...

1224
01:19:32,289 --> 01:19:33,420
I didn't.

1225
01:19:42,386 --> 01:19:43,604
[Lloyd] Hey! Watch where
the fuck you're going!

1226
01:19:43,735 --> 01:19:45,563
Watch it, watch it!

1227
01:19:45,693 --> 01:19:47,043
What the fuck
you doing, man?

1228
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:49,349
Jesus. Fuck!

1229
01:19:49,480 --> 01:19:52,222
That's it.
You're too fucked up
to drive.

[groans]

1231
01:19:55,138 --> 01:19:56,313
That's it.
Tour is over.

1232
01:19:56,443 --> 01:19:58,445
That's it, Jon!

1233
01:19:58,576 --> 01:20:02,188
We took your
little fucking ride
down memory lane!

1234
01:20:02,319 --> 01:20:05,583
I didn't ejaculate
in my pants!

1235
01:20:05,713 --> 01:20:08,716
I didn't
start screaming,
"I did it! I did it,"

1236
01:20:08,847 --> 01:20:10,457
which is what you
want me to do, huh?

1237
01:20:10,588 --> 01:20:12,242
Well, I can't help you!

1238
01:20:12,372 --> 01:20:14,461
It's over!

1239
01:20:14,592 --> 01:20:17,943
We both know
you're the real
last victim.

1240
01:20:18,074 --> 01:20:19,292
[coughing]

1241
01:20:19,423 --> 01:20:21,468
The last victim
of your own obsession.

1242
01:20:21,599 --> 01:20:23,122
So fucking jump!

1243
01:20:26,691 --> 01:20:28,388

not knowing the truth,
leaving me alone,

1247
01:20:36,483 --> 01:20:39,617
leaving the world
at risk, your world,
unguarded,

1248
01:20:39,747 --> 01:20:41,184
because
he's still out there!

1249
01:20:44,230 --> 01:20:48,104
And worst of all,
you won't be here

1250
01:20:48,234 --> 01:20:50,323
to know what happens
to friend or foe.

1251
01:20:53,761 --> 01:20:54,850
Die!

1252
01:20:56,721 --> 01:20:57,983
Die!

[coughing]

1254
01:21:09,386 --> 01:21:10,561
Feel better?

1255
01:21:17,655 --> 01:21:18,874
Jon...

1256
01:21:20,310 --> 01:21:22,225
What the fuck
did I ever do to you?

1257
01:21:25,271 --> 01:21:26,359
I'm sorry.

1258
01:21:28,231 --> 01:21:29,188
What?

1259
01:21:30,668 --> 01:21:32,278
You're sorry?

1260
01:21:32,409 --> 01:21:34,628
You're fucking sorry,
you piece of shit?

1261
01:21:34,759 --> 01:21:37,196
You're fucking sor...
[laughing] Sorry!

1262
01:21:51,210 --> 01:21:53,169
Jon...

1263
01:21:53,299 --> 01:21:55,432
I believe I can help you
after all.

1268
01:22:37,517 --> 01:22:39,302
Amazing.

1269
01:22:39,432 --> 01:22:40,781
After all you've done,

1270
01:22:40,912 --> 01:22:43,045
I can still look upon you
with mercy.

1271
01:22:43,175 --> 01:22:44,307
[muffled yelling]

1272
01:22:44,437 --> 01:22:45,612
I will give you
what you want.

1273
01:22:48,615 --> 01:22:50,487
You know why I am
the way I am?

1274
01:22:50,617 --> 01:22:53,272
Because I'm free!
[laughs]

1275
01:22:54,578 --> 01:22:56,188
Man created civilization

1276
01:22:56,319 --> 01:22:58,060
to protect himself
from himself.

1277
01:22:58,190 --> 01:22:59,365
[pounding]

1278
01:22:59,496 --> 01:23:01,759
But civilization
has one major drawback.

1279
01:23:01,889 --> 01:23:03,891
Frustration.

1280
01:23:04,022 --> 01:23:06,720
So to deal with
this frustration,

1281
01:23:06,851 --> 01:23:08,418
society has set up
a system

1282
01:23:08,548 --> 01:23:11,682
of laws and
moral prohibitions.

1283
01:23:11,812 --> 01:23:15,773
And it was your job
to enforce these laws.

1284
01:23:15,903 --> 01:23:17,122
Of course,
that's impossible.

1285
01:23:18,254 --> 01:23:19,429
The way I see it,

1286
01:23:19,559 --> 01:23:21,474
society gets the kind of
criminals it deserves.

1287
01:23:22,780 --> 01:23:24,825
The more it clamps down,

1288
01:23:24,956 --> 01:23:28,177
the more those of us
that are truly free

1289
01:23:28,307 --> 01:23:29,700
must rise up against it.

Sorry. I didn't mean
to frighten you,

1300
01:24:34,547 --> 01:24:37,507
but I noticed that
your left rear wheel
seemed to be wobbling.

1301
01:24:37,637 --> 01:24:38,725
It's not too bad,
but I think

1302
01:24:38,856 --> 01:24:41,337
you should
get it checked as soon
as possible.

1304

I will, thanks.

1306
01:24:47,082 --> 01:24:48,344

about 10 miles
up the road.

1308
01:24:51,086 --> 01:24:53,871
It's open 24 hours
and it's just off
the freeway.

1309

1310

Look...

If it'll make you
feel any better,

1313
01:25:06,492 --> 01:25:07,885
I've got a lug wrench
in my trunk.

1314
01:25:08,015 --> 01:25:09,756
I could tighten it up
for you a little.

1315
01:25:09,887 --> 01:25:12,107
You know, just to get you
to the station.

1316
01:25:16,720 --> 01:25:17,895
Well, if it wouldn't be
too much trouble.

1317
01:25:18,025 --> 01:25:20,332

have to get out.

out that way.

I appreciate it.

Must've been worse
than it looked.

you could make it

for sure.

I could do but

business.

on the road like this?

01:28:40,880 --> 01:28:41,794
Yes.

1369
01:28:43,883 --> 01:28:45,885

Do you see how
they're just out there
waiting to be taken?

1375

she's going to die.

of recognition.

01:29:22,226 --> 01:29:23,662
will be mine.

1383
01:29:25,664 --> 01:29:26,796
[Lloyd] Shit!

1384
01:29:26,926 --> 01:29:28,058
[woman] No!

1385
01:29:31,975 --> 01:29:33,193
[muffled yelling]

1386
01:29:33,324 --> 01:29:34,934
Make all the noise
you want!

1387
01:29:36,153 --> 01:29:37,676
[muffled yelling]

1388
01:29:46,381 --> 01:29:48,557
[Lloyd breathing heavily]

1389
01:29:48,687 --> 01:29:50,602
[Lloyd chuckles]

1390
01:29:50,733 --> 01:29:52,125
[gun firing repeatedly]

1391
01:29:58,697 --> 01:29:59,916
[firing continues]

1392
01:30:01,787 --> 01:30:03,398
[muffled yell]

1393
01:30:07,924 --> 01:30:09,404
Happy birthday.

1394
01:30:19,065 --> 01:30:20,763
[turn signal clicking]

1395
01:30:28,945 --> 01:30:30,555
[metallic scraping]

1396
01:30:35,342 --> 01:30:37,040
[muffled coughing]

1397
01:30:57,364 --> 01:30:59,628
These gloves just
don't seem to fit.

1398
01:31:05,416 --> 01:31:06,983
[muffled coughing]

1399
01:31:10,769 --> 01:31:12,902
What's wrong, Jon?

1400
01:31:13,032 --> 01:31:15,426
Don't you recognize
your old precinct?

1401
01:31:15,557 --> 01:31:18,473
Isn't this where
you wanted our tour
to end? Huh?

1402
01:31:30,006 --> 01:31:31,094
[metal detector buzzer sounds]

1403
01:31:31,224 --> 01:31:32,791
Excuse me, you...
Hey, whoa.

1404
01:31:33,357 --> 01:31:34,619
Jesus!

1405
01:31:35,054 --> 01:31:36,142
Get down!

1406
01:31:36,273 --> 01:31:37,622
Get down!

1407
01:31:37,753 --> 01:31:39,058
[people screaming]

1408
01:31:48,503 --> 01:31:50,113
[police officer]
Come on, bro.

1409
01:31:50,243 --> 01:31:51,767
Come on,
put the gun down.

1410
01:31:51,897 --> 01:31:53,116
Now!

1411
01:31:53,246 --> 01:31:55,292
Come on. You don't
want to die, right?

1412
01:31:55,422 --> 01:31:57,642
[coughing]

1413
01:31:57,773 --> 01:31:59,122
Don't make me do it.

1414
01:31:59,252 --> 01:32:02,342
-Are you going
to shoot me?
-Get down!

1415
01:32:02,473 --> 01:32:04,780
Or should I confess?
Is that what
you want me to do?

1416
01:32:04,910 --> 01:32:06,085
Huh?

1417
01:32:06,216 --> 01:32:07,783
-It's your move.
-Put it down!

1418
01:32:07,913 --> 01:32:08,958
It's your gun.

1419
01:32:09,088 --> 01:32:10,568
Your gloves.

1420
01:32:10,699 --> 01:32:12,048
Your car.

1421
01:32:12,178 --> 01:32:13,832
Your corpus delicti.

1422
01:32:16,966 --> 01:32:18,228
You're going down, Jon.

1423
01:32:20,186 --> 01:32:22,014
But at least as you lay
dying in your cell,

1424
01:32:22,145 --> 01:32:24,190
you'll know
that you were right.

1425
01:32:24,321 --> 01:32:26,758
At least
you'll have that.

1426
01:32:29,152 --> 01:32:33,156
It was me
all these years.

1427
01:32:33,286 --> 01:32:36,376
And it'll keep being me
long after you're gone.

1428
01:32:36,507 --> 01:32:38,683
Put the gun down,
or I'll drop you!

1429
01:32:39,510 --> 01:32:40,859
I'll miss you, Jon.

1430
01:32:44,907 --> 01:32:46,256
Put the gun down
on the ground now!

1431
01:32:46,386 --> 01:32:49,041
But I promise
to think of you
each and every time.

1432
01:32:51,043 --> 01:32:53,176
There.
Feel better?

1433
01:32:53,306 --> 01:32:54,743
Last chance!
I will drop you!

1434
01:32:56,832 --> 01:32:58,137
Now!

1435
01:32:58,268 --> 01:32:59,704
[woman screams]

1436
01:33:13,979 --> 01:33:15,198
[siren wailing]

1437
01:33:16,329 --> 01:33:17,896
I feel like shit.

1438
01:33:19,506 --> 01:33:20,812
[groans]

1439
01:33:25,512 --> 01:33:26,775
[coughs]
