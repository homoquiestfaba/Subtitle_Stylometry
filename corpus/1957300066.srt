00:00:29,729 --> 00:00:34,462
Place your empty cartons in the
assigned slots, then sit down.

3
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:44,540
Our school has been singled out among
middle schools nationwide

4
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:50,410
as a model to others in the national milk
promotion campaign.

5
00:00:54,154 --> 00:00:57,317
You're approaching the development of secondary
sexual characteristics.

6
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:02,925
The calcium in the milk
isn't just good for your bones,

7
00:01:03,129 --> 00:01:04,653
but for the nervous system, too.

8
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:19,505
I confiscated these adult titles from
Mr. Kamiyama last month.

9
00:01:20,346 --> 00:01:23,247
Mr. Watanabe hacked the censorship
at his dad's store,

10
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:27,352
and Mr. Kamiyama circulated them
among all the boys.

11
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:34,385
As you're aware, your minds
and bodies are developing.

12
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:35,856
you really kissed?

13
00:01:36,062 --> 00:01:37,529
It's called "puberty".

14
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:44,567
I'm unsure of milk's actual effect
on 13 year old bodies and minds,

15
00:01:46,372 --> 00:01:50,001
but April's annual check-up
will surely yield some results.

16
00:01:51,344 --> 00:01:53,642
Not that I'll be here.

17
00:01:57,016 --> 00:02:01,646
I quit teaching at the end of the month.

18
00:02:01,855 --> 00:02:02,753
For real?

19
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:03,820
Fantastic!

20
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,424
(25th March - 7th Grade, Class B)(End of term)

21
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:20,766
I've no idea if I was a good teacher or not.

22
00:02:26,846 --> 00:02:30,441
Shut up, teacher's talking.

23
00:02:35,421 --> 00:02:36,615
Thank you, Mr. Hoshino.

24
00:02:40,894 --> 00:02:43,192
By the way, anyone know Dr. Sakuramiya?

25
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:46,889
He wrote this book. He's amazing.

26
00:02:47,133 --> 00:02:48,760
He's just an incredible person.

27
00:02:48,968 --> 00:02:52,597
Famous as an educator via his books,
TV appearances...

28
00:02:55,608 --> 00:03:00,307
An ex-delinquent, he traveled the globe then
returned to be a teacher, right?

29
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:04,108
Correct. Last year he found out
he only has a few months left to live

30
00:03:04,317 --> 00:03:09,016
but chose to keep teaching until the very end.

31
00:03:13,993 --> 00:03:18,430
My first placement was at the school he taught.

32
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,056
Really?

33
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:23,565
"The weak of heart visit hurt
on those weaker still.

34
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:27,831
"Do they have any choice
beyond endurance or death?

35
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:32,435
"No, you guys inhabit a world
much wider than that.

36
00:03:32,645 --> 00:03:36,843
"If life is harsh where you are,
why not take refuge elsewhere?"

37
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:38,546
Take refuge.

38
00:03:38,751 --> 00:03:40,582
She said it. Let's go.

39
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:52,494
Already, the esteemed teacher's words are working.
What power.

40
00:03:52,832 --> 00:03:53,821
I don't mind.

41
00:03:55,702 --> 00:04:00,867
Compared to him, I find myself
lacking as a teacher.

42
00:04:01,174 --> 00:04:04,200
I set myself just two rules.

43
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:06,871
I would always address you formally.

44
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:11,540
I'd try to see things your way
and speak to you politely.

45
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:15,885
No casual chats nor advice about
anything under the sun...

46
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:19,820
For those wanting a teacher one sees on TV,

47
00:04:20,026 --> 00:04:22,620
I daresay I came across as cold.

48
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:25,230
Sorry, Miss Noguchi.

49
00:04:25,565 --> 00:04:29,467
Your midnight texts saying,
"I wish I was slim. I want to die"

50
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:32,137
didn't get a kindly response.

51
00:04:32,705 --> 00:04:36,732
I just can't bring myself to believe all you say.

52
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:38,739
But you're our teacher...

53
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:42,103
There was an incident,

54
00:04:43,883 --> 00:04:46,818
when a young male teacher got a text

55
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:50,916
from a girl saying she'd lost her will to live.

56
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:54,551
He raced round to the hotel where she was.

57
00:04:55,695 --> 00:04:58,357
She took his photo, showed her parents,

58
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:01,026
who stormed over to the school.

59
00:05:02,735 --> 00:05:04,032
It's so ridiculous.

60
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:08,835
It was just a prank from a girl sore
at being scolded in class.

61
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:12,075
The teacher was naive not to have suspected her.

62
00:05:12,278 --> 00:05:14,974
You're our teacher. Don't you trust us?

63
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:19,145
No, because you're all so good at lying.

64
00:05:19,352 --> 00:05:21,320
See you on the rooftop.

65
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:27,393
Miss, I'm not feeling well.
Can I go to the infirmary?

66
00:05:27,593 --> 00:05:28,651
Sure.

67
00:05:31,464 --> 00:05:35,400
Since that incident, our school policy is,

68
00:05:35,635 --> 00:05:41,505
should a student summon a teacher,
a same-gender teacher responds.

69
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:45,435
If a boy in this class summons me,

70
00:05:45,645 --> 00:05:48,375
Mr. Tokura of Class A goes instead.

71
00:05:48,581 --> 00:05:50,776
As our teacher, you're avoiding responsibility.

72
00:05:50,983 --> 00:05:52,473
"Avoiding responsibility"

73
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:55,279
It might seem that way.

74
00:05:55,722 --> 00:05:58,384
But only to a girl as self-obsessed as you,

75
00:05:58,591 --> 00:06:03,153
who worries over her chances of
marrying pop-stars.

76
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:04,826
Who got so upset one night.

77
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:08,928
She claimed she'd lost the will to live.

78
00:06:09,135 --> 00:06:14,163
So that you people never again
talk of wishing for death,

79
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:18,370
I'll talk about something important.

80
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:24,610
Life

81
00:06:35,928 --> 00:06:39,022
As you know, I'm a single mother.

82
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:44,730
I was supposed to marry Manami's father.

83
00:06:45,505 --> 00:06:48,804
He was a teacher, too and a man I respect.

84
00:06:49,842 --> 00:06:53,369
Just before our wedding, I got pregnant,

85
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:58,342
and he discovered he was infected with HIV.

86
00:06:58,985 --> 00:07:02,819
HIV... the Human Immunodeficiency Virus,

87
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:04,920
the cause of AIDS,

88
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:09,720
which he apparently got from adventures overseas.

89
00:07:11,063 --> 00:07:15,022
Don't hold your breath.
There's no airborne transmission.

90
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:17,694
Hand-shakes, coughs, sneezes,

91
00:07:17,904 --> 00:07:21,237
public baths, pools are also not
routes of infection.

92
00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:26,645
Daily life presents no danger
from an infected person.

93
00:07:26,846 --> 00:07:28,837
I myself did not get it.

94
00:07:31,017 --> 00:07:35,317
HIV isn't necessarily transmitted by sex, either.

95
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:39,853
I didn't believe it and had myself retested.

96
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:44,857
To have the child but not get married:

97
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:48,925
that was our conclusion.

98
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:50,602
Why not get married?

99
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:53,397
Even if the child wasn't infected,

100
00:07:53,606 --> 00:07:57,303
word of the father's infection would bring
unavoidable discrimination.

101
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:58,499
Surely that's worse?

102
00:07:58,711 --> 00:08:03,444
This would cause more harm than lack of a father.

103
00:08:03,716 --> 00:08:09,177
That was his decision and I agreed.

104
00:08:09,388 --> 00:08:11,322
The poor kid.

105
00:08:13,726 --> 00:08:16,991
Putting the kid first, made us do what we did.

106
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:25,164
More than anyone,

107
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:29,100
he must've longed to hold her.

108
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:32,203
His pain,

109
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:35,747
was much greater than mine.

110
00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:41,479
I poured all my affections into Manami.

111
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:46,952
When Manami turned 1, I returned to work.

112
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:50,018
She was in day-care until 6pm.

113
00:08:50,229 --> 00:08:53,858
The HR center introduced a Mrs. Takenaka,

114
00:08:54,066 --> 00:08:56,933
who looked after Manami after that.

115
00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:00,261
She kept a dog called, "Mook".

116
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:03,399
Manami loved that dog.

117
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:07,806
Feeding him was Manami's special task.

118
00:09:09,749 --> 00:09:12,650
Mrs. Takenaka was hospitalized in the new year.

119
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:16,317
So I'd have to finish up to be at day-care by 6pm.

120
00:09:16,522 --> 00:09:21,255
On teacher conference days,
I picked Manami up earlier,

121
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:25,686
and had her wait in the infirmary
until the meeting finished.

122
00:09:37,777 --> 00:09:42,077
Manami loved the Cotton Bunny character.

123
00:09:43,816 --> 00:09:46,876
She had the bag, the handkerchief,

124
00:09:48,054 --> 00:09:50,147
the tissues, the shoes...

125
00:09:52,124 --> 00:09:55,890
Mr. Shimomura you remember this purse?

126
00:09:56,562 --> 00:10:00,225
Please, I want it, I want it!

127
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:02,230
But I just bought a jacket, right?

128
00:10:03,035 --> 00:10:06,095
Why not, it's just a purse?

129
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:10,036
Looking back, maybe you were right.

130
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:12,741
Because in the end...

131
00:10:14,313 --> 00:10:15,405
Manami?

132
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:26,719
It was her last act of willfulness.

133
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:33,824
Miss!

134
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,501
February 13th

135
00:10:38,871 --> 00:10:44,173
The police ruled it "accidental death
due to fall into a body of water".

136
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:47,976
Breadcrumbs were found near the dog,

137
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:53,117
from the same bread as at Manami's day-care.

138
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:58,789
Apparently she went to
the pool secretly, each week,

139
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:01,556
to give Mook his dinner.

140
00:11:03,262 --> 00:11:04,251
She's crying.

141
00:11:04,463 --> 00:11:05,896
Why are you crying?

142
00:11:07,199 --> 00:11:08,632
Manami's no longer with us.

143
00:11:12,972 --> 00:11:15,702
Those little hands,

144
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:18,370
will no longer touch my skin.

145
00:11:19,045 --> 00:11:21,570
My hands will no longer

146
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:25,378
stroke that soft face and hair.

147
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:28,711
As her guardian,

148
00:11:29,722 --> 00:11:33,852
Manami's death must be my responsibility.

149
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:35,656
However,

150
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:39,925
I can't leave it at that.

151
00:11:43,402 --> 00:11:45,131
Manami is dead.

152
00:11:47,406 --> 00:11:48,998
But it wasn't accidental.

153
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:52,036
She was killed,

154
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:56,137
by students in this class.

155
00:12:09,428 --> 00:12:12,397
You won't believe what Moriguchi just said.

156
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:25,467
What's your greatest protection?

157
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:27,643
Is it your parents?

158
00:12:28,147 --> 00:12:29,580
Is it a weapon?

159
00:12:31,817 --> 00:12:35,048
Your most trustworthy ally and protector

160
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:39,256
is the juvenile legal code.

161
00:12:40,126 --> 00:12:45,689
Under Article 41 of the penal code minors
are not criminally responsible.

162
00:12:45,898 --> 00:12:47,195
You can't be arrested.

163
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:49,729
Wonderfull, huh?

164
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:54,030
A girl 13 like yourselves,

165
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,643
calling it "a holy rite",
laced her family dinners with poison.

166
00:12:59,145 --> 00:13:02,114
Then blogged in detail about the symptoms.

167
00:13:02,815 --> 00:13:03,645
The "Lunacy" thing?

168
00:13:03,849 --> 00:13:05,476
Yes, "The Lunacy Incident".

169
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:08,518
A name she'd used in the blog

170
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:12,054
which the mass media picked up
and used to fan the flames.

171
00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:18,289
In the end the reason she killed her
entire family with cyanide

172
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:21,526
remains a total mystery.

173
00:13:21,934 --> 00:13:24,698
Which just served to spawn wild ideas,

174
00:13:25,704 --> 00:13:29,071
and earn her heroine status among her peers.

175
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,042
Tell us who the hell did it.

176
00:13:35,247 --> 00:13:40,742
The science teacher who'd taught her
about the chemicals

177
00:13:40,953 --> 00:13:42,420
was persecuted mercilessly.

178
00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:47,286
The girl herself composing contrite statements
in a juvenile facility,

179
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:49,256
will return to society, right-as-rain.

180
00:13:50,462 --> 00:13:51,690
You guys can murder

181
00:13:51,897 --> 00:13:53,489
and get clean away.

182
00:13:53,699 --> 00:13:55,929
That's exactly why I did it!

183
00:13:56,135 --> 00:13:57,602
In any case,

184
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:01,130
murder can't be prevented.

185
00:14:01,907 --> 00:14:05,638
If the mood takes you,
grab a bat from the baseball team,

186
00:14:06,378 --> 00:14:10,144
a knife from home economics,
a jump-rope from the sports locker...

187
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,181
even these bare hands...

188
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:15,682
...will do the job.

189
00:14:16,555 --> 00:14:17,715
That hurts.

190
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,487
Sorry.

191
00:14:20,092 --> 00:14:21,150
Quickly...

192
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:27,524
You're all dying to know
the name of the culprit, right?

193
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:30,032
I do apologize,

194
00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:33,333
but I don't feel like making it public.

195
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:36,007
That's the important bit!

196
00:14:38,611 --> 00:14:41,478
Manami's father was Dr. Sakuramiya.

197
00:14:47,286 --> 00:14:49,720
The reason we held a private ceremony,

198
00:14:49,922 --> 00:14:54,359
was so he could grieve for her openly.

199
00:14:55,794 --> 00:14:58,729
It was the first time he had held her,

200
00:14:59,265 --> 00:15:01,733
yet her soul had already gone.

201
00:15:02,534 --> 00:15:06,994
He told me that he'd developed AIDS.

202
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:11,500
He'd only a few months left to live.

203
00:15:12,444 --> 00:15:14,378
I didn't know what to say.

204
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:17,642
I think...

205
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:22,787
the day that Manami died,
some important thing inside me

206
00:15:22,988 --> 00:15:25,183
died along with her.

207
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:35,595
Last week I went to Mrs. Takenaka's house.

208
00:15:36,168 --> 00:15:39,262
to pick up some of Manami's things.

209
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:42,735
Among them, was this...

210
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:46,836
the purse she'd begged for but I didn't buy.

211
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:49,176
Why was it there?

212
00:15:49,848 --> 00:15:53,215
Mrs. Takenaka found it in Mook's kennel.

213
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:00,781
They roll over here sometimes.

214
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:06,263
You know how students play catch
when they're cleaning the pool?

215
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:13,570
I remembered that one of the penalties
for breaking school rules

216
00:16:14,206 --> 00:16:18,905
was poolside cleaning duty
or tidying the sports locker.

217
00:16:22,748 --> 00:16:23,373
Not me.

218
00:16:23,582 --> 00:16:25,277
I know who did it!

219
00:16:26,452 --> 00:16:27,510
On that day...

220
00:16:29,521 --> 00:16:31,751
did Manami go to the pool alone?

221
00:16:38,897 --> 00:16:39,921
There were two killers.

222
00:16:53,645 --> 00:16:57,513
Henceforth, I'll refer to them
as Students A and B.

223
00:17:12,131 --> 00:17:17,125
Student A has excellent grades
and outwardly presents no problem.

224
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:23,064
Although occasionally,
I heard disturbing rumors about him.

225
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:26,403
Since elementalry school, he traps cats and dogs,

226
00:17:26,612 --> 00:17:28,978
then tortures them to
death in his "execution machine".

227
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:30,910
"Execution machine"?

228
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:34,075
A weird contraption he made.

229
00:17:34,286 --> 00:17:37,915
Then he posts photos on his website.

232
00:17:43,495 --> 00:17:47,056
I called his elementalry teacher, just in case.

233
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:50,027
They just said he wasn't a problem.

234
00:17:50,836 --> 00:17:53,737
Just when I was beginning to
put it out of my mind...

235
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:55,336
What was your major?

236
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:57,270
Student A came to my lab.

237
00:17:57,476 --> 00:17:58,670
Chemistry.

238
00:17:59,678 --> 00:18:01,009
Anything electrical?

239
00:18:02,448 --> 00:18:06,282
Your father would be more knowledgable than me.

240
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,354
Open it, there's something nice inside.

241
00:18:19,331 --> 00:18:20,229
Isn't it great?

242
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,465
Am I your guinea-pig?

243
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:31,942
You made this to kill more animals?

244
00:18:32,144 --> 00:18:34,203
Is that all you can say?

245
00:18:39,685 --> 00:18:40,947
Pop.

246
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,480
What?

247
00:18:43,021 --> 00:18:44,113
You didn't hear it.

248
00:18:46,158 --> 00:18:49,059
The sound of something important
disappearing forever.

253
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:09,137
No "execution machine" then?

254
00:19:10,182 --> 00:19:11,740
Whatever. Just put your seal on it.

255
00:19:12,885 --> 00:19:17,254
From the disarm function he'd added,
his stress on its safety

256
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:21,353
through to his pure and eager
7th grader report style...

257
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,255
...it all filled me with dread.

"A contribution to society"?

259
00:19:25,864 --> 00:19:28,162
If you think it's that dangerous,

260
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:30,961
leave it for the judges to decide.

261
00:19:31,803 --> 00:19:36,638
I did ask the Principal
but my fears were laughed away.

262
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:40,745
In the end, his "Shocking Anti-Theft Purse"

263
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:44,915
earned the award of excellence
in the Middle School finals.

Conclusion: Shuya Watanabe

266
00:19:56,795 --> 00:20:01,061
I asked him the truth about Manami's death.

267
00:20:12,945 --> 00:20:13,809
Just kidding...

268
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:18,312
He discussed it quite happily.

269
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:24,417
As if unaware the mother of
the murdered child was before him.

270
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:29,584
Student A's motivation for the killing

271
00:20:29,928 --> 00:20:32,089
was laughably simple.

272
00:20:32,931 --> 00:20:35,798
For the world to acknowledge his genius.

273
00:20:36,001 --> 00:20:39,095
He wanted acclaim as a superior person.

274
00:20:39,938 --> 00:20:44,671
However the day his science project
made the papers...

275
00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:48,336
it wasn't him who won the acclaim.

(Middle School Girl Murders 4 Family Members)

277
00:20:52,147 --> 00:20:52,918
but another 13 year old.

278
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:56,445
You win praise for doing good
but nobody really notices.

279
00:20:56,688 --> 00:20:59,657
That Lunacy thing was no big ideal.

280
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:02,952
Why is Potassium Cyanide special?

281
00:21:03,228 --> 00:21:05,196
If it were me, every single thing...

282
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:07,521
I'd create with my own hands.

283
00:21:08,033 --> 00:21:09,660
I want to kill him.

284
00:21:13,405 --> 00:21:17,102
That was exactly how I felt.

285
00:21:20,879 --> 00:21:24,246
Student B began school and started sports.

286
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:27,316
But it was all strength-building
and he never got to hold a racket.

287
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:29,646
Die, die, die, die.

288
00:21:29,855 --> 00:21:34,155
Though unhappy, he hadn't the courage to
talk to his course adviser.

289
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:39,595
He had his mom get him off sports
and started at cram school.

290
00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:43,832
His grades didn't improve and he started to worry

291
00:21:44,503 --> 00:21:46,403
but didn't work any harder.

292
00:21:53,378 --> 00:21:56,905
He made it to a police station and was held there,

293
00:21:57,783 --> 00:22:02,777
but was shocked when Mr. Tokura
came to pick him up.

294
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:05,320
Why isn't it Miss Moriguchi?

295
00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:08,385
Just shut up, idiot.

296
00:22:08,593 --> 00:22:10,823
Die, die, die...

297
00:22:11,897 --> 00:22:15,333
For breaking the rule against
entering video arcades,

298
00:22:15,534 --> 00:22:17,297
he was given a penalty.

299
00:22:18,904 --> 00:22:23,307
2 weeks cleaning poolside and the changing rooms.

300
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:27,008
He'd never have the balls to kill.

301
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:34,747
I heard this a from Student B in his own home.

302
00:22:36,588 --> 00:22:41,389
His mother sat beside him.
Each time he spoke she'd say...

303
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,250
You poor thing...

304
00:22:44,129 --> 00:22:46,188
She said it time and again.

305
00:22:47,099 --> 00:22:50,193
Not about my dead daughter but about him.

306
00:22:54,306 --> 00:22:58,208
Around February, Student A made his approach to B,

307
00:22:59,111 --> 00:23:02,171
to lure him in to his dreadfull plan.

308
00:23:13,692 --> 00:23:15,592
I wonder who it can be?

309
00:23:18,029 --> 00:23:19,326
What?

310
00:23:20,932 --> 00:23:23,332
Is that the thing that won the prize?

311
00:23:23,802 --> 00:23:26,737
It's got more power now, so I want to test it out.

312
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:32,606
Could be anyone, but the idea was to zap bad guys.

313
00:23:33,211 --> 00:23:34,906
Then let's test it on bad guys.

314
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:38,273
Student B first suggested Mr. Tokura.

315
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:41,143
Student A didn't respond.

316
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:45,518
Then Student B put my name forward.

317
00:23:45,724 --> 00:23:46,918
It was just unforgiveable.

318
00:23:47,626 --> 00:23:51,926
Her own student in a tight spot yet
she sent a different teacher.

319
00:23:52,564 --> 00:23:54,828
She's already been a guinea-pig.

320
00:23:55,033 --> 00:23:57,934
Student A shot down that idea.

321
00:23:58,537 --> 00:24:01,005
How about her daughter?

322
00:24:02,174 --> 00:24:07,009
It'd teach her to put her kid
before the needs of her students.

323
00:24:07,746 --> 00:24:11,011
Student B described Manami's trips

324
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:14,749
to the pool to feed the dog.

325
00:24:15,687 --> 00:24:18,747
And about the purse she so wanted

326
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:21,524
but I didn't buy her at the mall.

327
00:24:28,033 --> 00:24:29,694
The one they selected for their target,

328
00:24:30,535 --> 00:24:33,402
was the youngest and the weakest.

329
00:24:34,239 --> 00:24:36,139
It was my daughter.

330
00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:53,781
Your mom didn't buy you this, right?

331
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,091
Or did she, already?

332
00:24:58,763 --> 00:25:02,631
I thought so, because she told us
to get it for you.

333
00:25:02,901 --> 00:25:03,765
She did?

334
00:25:05,537 --> 00:25:08,700
A Valentine Day present from your lovely mom.

335
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:10,967
Open it up,

336
00:25:11,543 --> 00:25:13,204
there's chocolate inside.

337
00:25:38,737 --> 00:25:42,332
What happened? She's not moving...

338
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:43,906
She's dead.

339
00:25:44,109 --> 00:25:48,273
He was in a total panic... kicking up such a fuss.

340
00:25:48,613 --> 00:25:51,707
You can tell everyone it was me who did it.

341
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:54,985
After I said that, I went home.

342
00:25:57,022 --> 00:25:58,250
Then that idiot...

343
00:26:03,495 --> 00:26:06,020
If they realized the purse killed her,

344
00:26:06,932 --> 00:26:09,298
suspicion would fall on me.

345
00:26:20,478 --> 00:26:22,673
So I figured I'd make it look like she fell.

346
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:28,719
A spur of the moment decision.

347
00:26:51,643 --> 00:26:55,079
This is how Manami died.

348
00:27:10,729 --> 00:27:12,629
As I already told the 2 boys,

349
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:18,296
If the police ruled it an accident
I won't rehash that verdict.

350
00:27:21,706 --> 00:27:22,832
But there is one thing.

351
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:26,568
What killed her wasn't the purse.

352
00:27:30,048 --> 00:27:32,915
I had it thoroughly checked out.

353
00:27:33,118 --> 00:27:37,316
It's incapable of stopping
even a 4 year old's heart.

354
00:27:37,722 --> 00:27:39,781
It's a pathetic piece of work.

355
00:27:40,592 --> 00:27:41,923
Want to try it?

356
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:48,489
Manami had simply fallen unconscious.

357
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:53,471
She drowned after B threw her in.

358
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:57,403
That was the indisputable cause of Manami's death.

359
00:27:59,077 --> 00:28:00,510
It's so ironic.

360
00:28:01,479 --> 00:28:05,711
Student A had homicidal intent
but wasn't able to kill.

361
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:11,820
Student B did not but brought about her death.

362
00:28:12,891 --> 00:28:14,756
Even if arraigned by the authorities,

363
00:28:14,959 --> 00:28:19,293
juvenile law would mandate
simple custodial supervision.

364
00:28:20,098 --> 00:28:22,157
Innocent to all intents and purposes.

365
00:28:23,134 --> 00:28:26,900
I judged that to be insufficient.

366
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:33,509
Teachers have a responsibility to
guide students back to the right path.

367
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:40,515
I want them to admit their crime
and appreciate how precious life is.

368
00:28:41,686 --> 00:28:46,783
I want them to realize the gravity of their crime
and live with that burden.

369
00:28:51,096 --> 00:28:53,564
The milk that you all just drank...

370
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:58,360
Two of them had something extra mixed in.

371
00:29:03,541 --> 00:29:08,240
The HIV-infected blood of Dr. Sakuramiya.

372
00:29:20,825 --> 00:29:22,224
Be quiet!

373
00:29:24,229 --> 00:29:27,130
You were both kind enough to drink it.

374
00:29:27,332 --> 00:29:28,299
Thank you.

375
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:32,497
Please be sure to get a blood test
in a couple of months.

376
00:29:32,804 --> 00:29:36,968
If it worked, you'll have
a 5-10 year incubation wait.

377
00:29:37,809 --> 00:29:39,777
Plenty of time I should think,

378
00:29:39,978 --> 00:29:43,345
to reflect on things and
appreciate the preciousness of life.

379
00:29:59,497 --> 00:30:00,555
Springtime...

380
00:30:01,032 --> 00:30:05,435
when the flowers, trees,
grass, birds, people, too...

381
00:30:05,737 --> 00:30:08,205
all blossom into life.

382
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:16,712
Every one of you,

383
00:30:18,049 --> 00:30:20,540
please have a meaningfull spring break.

385
00:30:23,288 --> 00:30:24,880
That's the end.

386
00:31:13,271 --> 00:31:14,932
Miss Yuko...

387
00:31:16,474 --> 00:31:18,738
Can you believe it?

388
00:31:21,346 --> 00:31:25,646
After you left and the new term started,

389
00:31:29,287 --> 00:31:32,347
our class could be this full of smilling faces?

390
00:31:33,458 --> 00:31:35,255
(6th April - 8th Grade, Class B)(Start of term)

391
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:40,989
April... suddenly it's 8th grade
and there's a new homeroom teacher.

392
00:31:41,199 --> 00:31:45,101
Wer-ther has been my nickname since school.

393
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:49,097
Doesn't mean I spend my days in sorrow!

394
00:31:49,307 --> 00:31:51,502
His jokes aren't funny.

395
00:31:54,045 --> 00:31:55,842
too pally from day one.

396
00:31:56,047 --> 00:31:57,241
Hayakawa?

397
00:31:57,682 --> 00:31:58,944
And Naoki?

398
00:31:59,217 --> 00:32:01,583
Absent again with a cold.

399
00:32:01,786 --> 00:32:05,313
We all knew he wasn't ill at all.

400
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:08,524
What surprised us more,

401
00:32:09,327 --> 00:32:12,990
was that Shuya was at school at all.

402
00:32:13,197 --> 00:32:16,462
I wasn't a good student back in my schooldays.

403
00:32:17,001 --> 00:32:21,563
But one particular book by
one particular man changed my life.

404
00:32:24,309 --> 00:32:26,277
That wasn't just unfunny,

405
00:32:28,212 --> 00:32:30,009
it was a cruel joke.

"As I wandered the globe
I began to read the Bible. "

407

"In it, I glimpsed the true nature of education. "

408
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:43,989
"Though a man might have 100 sheep,"

409
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:46,221
"should just 1 go astray,"

410
00:32:47,098 --> 00:32:49,362
"in order to save that 1, the man,"

411
00:32:50,501 --> 00:32:54,335
"even though he risk the 99 others... "

Everyone was desperate to
escape the truth you thrust at us.

417
00:33:15,393 --> 00:33:16,917
I'll hand whatever you throw at me!

418
00:33:19,564 --> 00:33:22,226

I've been lying.

Naoki's not absent because of illness.

429
00:34:15,086 --> 00:34:17,281
But he's not skipping school.

430
00:34:17,488 --> 00:34:20,946
He wants to come but a mental issue prevents him.

431
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:26,256
The only person in class who
doesn't know the reason is Werther himself.

<i>Anyone leaks teacher's confession

right after the end of the previous term.

Okay, say we take turns making notes,

437
00:34:47,852 --> 00:34:51,913

deliver them?

Me-the-hoe.

445
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:14,904
Like the name, "Mizuho".

as enthusiastic as you,

maybe Naoki would've escaped
this mental issue he has.

00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:09,532
That lady, she was a single mother, right?

Bringing her own child to work,
in the first place...

455
00:36:13,404 --> 00:36:19,070
To avoid talking about the incident,
she kept criticizing Miss Yuko.

456
00:36:20,244 --> 00:36:25,614
She was so caught up in her own child
she'd no time for her students.

- If I might say...
- poor Naoki...

Yet for all that,

470
00:37:27,712 --> 00:37:29,043
he doesn't wash his hair,

471
00:37:30,948 --> 00:37:32,006
nor take a bath.

472
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:35,442

yesterday's homework.

I don't want a brave student's
warning to be in vain.

532
00:44:17,755 --> 00:44:19,985
It's not bullying but jealousy.

533
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:26,388
Someone's harassing him out of
envy at his top grades.

534
00:44:26,864 --> 00:44:31,164
But just because he's good that
doesn't make you inferior!

535
00:44:31,368 --> 00:44:34,269
Nobody thinks that for a second.

536
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:38,103
Being smart is part of Shuya's individuality.

537
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:41,410
Just like you all have your own individuality.

538
00:44:41,612 --> 00:44:43,944
The individuality to persecute the weak.

539
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:46,676
The individuality to forget bad things.

540
00:44:47,151 --> 00:44:49,949
I want you all to nurture those identities.

541
00:44:51,155 --> 00:44:54,488
As I keep watch over you.

542
00:45:10,874 --> 00:45:12,705
You snitched, right?

543
00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:14,502
No way.

544
00:45:14,712 --> 00:45:15,701
It wasn't me.

545
00:45:16,113 --> 00:45:20,140
The reason I was suspect was

546
00:45:20,350 --> 00:45:22,011
my Punish-Him Point score

547
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:23,243
Mizuki - 0 points

548
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:36,294
Allying yourself with a murderer.

549
00:45:36,734 --> 00:45:38,599
Don't you have any feelings?

550
00:45:40,771 --> 00:45:43,035
Don't you feel sorry for Miss Yuko?

551
00:45:46,710 --> 00:45:47,404
Let me go.

552
00:45:47,711 --> 00:45:50,145
Kiss... kiss...

553
00:45:54,485 --> 00:45:55,918
Miss...

554
00:45:57,454 --> 00:45:59,445
our class is messed up.

555
00:46:07,531 --> 00:46:09,294
Naoki's crying.

556
00:46:10,234 --> 00:46:15,570
He's probably remembering the incident.

557
00:46:16,907 --> 00:46:22,209
He's feeling sorry for that girl who died.

558
00:46:23,514 --> 00:46:24,708
I understand that.

559
00:46:27,050 --> 00:46:29,484
He hasn't changed at all.

560
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:32,347
Still as gentle as ever.

561
00:46:33,524 --> 00:46:34,456
My dear Naoki.

562
00:46:41,565 --> 00:46:42,691
K... I...

563
00:46:47,571 --> 00:46:52,008
L... L... E... R...

564
00:46:53,610 --> 00:46:54,668
"Killer - Die"

565
00:47:32,916 --> 00:47:35,441
Can you meet at the Koshu bridge?

566
00:47:42,159 --> 00:47:44,184
I'll be there.

567
00:48:02,512 --> 00:48:04,070
So there it is.

568
00:48:07,551 --> 00:48:08,711
I wasn't worried.

569
00:48:11,288 --> 00:48:13,153
I knew you'd be okay.

570
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:28,894
Want a soda?

571
00:48:34,845 --> 00:48:35,834
You say you knew?

572
00:48:39,383 --> 00:48:41,783
I figured Miss Yuko lied all along.

573
00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:46,516
Mixing AIDS blood into the milk...

574
00:48:47,791 --> 00:48:50,521
People were dumb to believe it.

575
00:48:50,928 --> 00:48:51,952
Why?

576
00:48:52,829 --> 00:48:54,091
Think about it.

577
00:48:54,564 --> 00:48:58,660
If you're serious about revenge,
about killing someone,

578
00:49:00,637 --> 00:49:02,605
you don't say stuff like that.

579
00:49:03,373 --> 00:49:04,533
I wonder...

580
00:49:04,741 --> 00:49:06,470
She'd never do it.

581
00:49:06,977 --> 00:49:10,743
No matter how much she hated you.

582
00:49:11,648 --> 00:49:13,206
There's no way she could.

583
00:49:14,584 --> 00:49:20,352
It was just a way to make you
two think stuff over.

584
00:49:22,059 --> 00:49:23,890
I could just tell.

585
00:49:24,895 --> 00:49:26,487
Aren't you scared?

586
00:49:27,731 --> 00:49:28,993
Of me?

587
00:49:35,539 --> 00:49:37,473
Even though I'm Student A?

588
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:43,609
Why did you show me your result?

589
00:49:46,616 --> 00:49:48,709
My life's nothing.

590
00:49:50,620 --> 00:49:52,713
But yours is precious.

591
00:50:50,647 --> 00:50:55,380
Sending texts, inciting everyone,
it's obviously you.

592
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:57,050
Mr. Hoshino

593
00:51:07,764 --> 00:51:09,891
Any more shit from you...

594
00:51:10,634 --> 00:51:13,034
you'll get tongue next time.

595
00:51:14,771 --> 00:51:15,999
Just kidding.

596
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:58,209
I'll buy everything...

597
00:52:00,317 --> 00:52:01,875
everything he touched.

598
00:52:23,807 --> 00:52:26,935
Best not eat it you might get AIDS.

599
00:52:29,713 --> 00:52:31,112
At the end of last term,

600
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:34,277
Miss Moriguchi infected my milk...

601
00:52:34,484 --> 00:52:40,047
He then told me the most terrifying thing.

602
00:52:41,725 --> 00:52:43,249
That Moriguchi,

603
00:52:44,261 --> 00:52:45,592
she's the devil incarnate.

604
00:52:46,229 --> 00:52:48,459
Darling, let's go to hospital.

605
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:51,164
It doesn't matter.

606
00:52:51,368 --> 00:52:54,929
Don't be silly. If you die what about me?

607
00:52:55,138 --> 00:52:56,537
I'm a murderer, you know.

608
00:52:56,740 --> 00:52:57,866
Nonsense.

609
00:52:58,241 --> 00:53:00,835
You just moved the body to help a friend.

610
00:53:01,044 --> 00:53:04,445
It wasn't a body. She was unconscious.

611
00:53:04,748 --> 00:53:06,773
I dropped her in the pool.

612
00:53:09,386 --> 00:53:11,286
But... they said...

613
00:53:11,488 --> 00:53:15,219
Hang on... you didn't know she was alive.

614
00:53:15,425 --> 00:53:16,824
Not true, Mom...

615
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:22,491
She woke up, right in front of me.

616
00:53:31,875 --> 00:53:33,206
And then...

617
00:53:33,910 --> 00:53:35,275
I just...

618
00:53:45,956 --> 00:53:47,355
July...

619
00:53:52,229 --> 00:53:57,428
No-one harasses Shuya any more.

620
00:53:59,202 --> 00:54:01,363
"... harasses Shuya any more. "

621
00:54:12,415 --> 00:54:14,076
Don't look, it's just a letter.

622
00:54:14,284 --> 00:54:15,148
To who?

623
00:54:15,352 --> 00:54:17,513
I won't send it.

624
00:54:17,887 --> 00:54:21,448
It's just good to write down my feelings.

625
00:54:31,001 --> 00:54:32,263
Amazing...

626
00:54:33,303 --> 00:54:34,793
It's great, Shuya...

627
00:54:37,674 --> 00:54:39,733
That's all I needed.

628
00:54:41,978 --> 00:54:45,641
I just wanted someone to praise me.

629
00:54:47,951 --> 00:54:49,782
I'd been without a mother

630
00:54:50,787 --> 00:54:52,084
for so long,

631
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:54,423
I'd been so alone...

632
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:57,593
Everything I'd never been able to talk about,

633
00:54:58,194 --> 00:55:00,128
I opened up to Shuya.

634
00:55:01,031 --> 00:55:02,362
The Lunacy girl...

635
00:55:03,533 --> 00:55:05,467
she's such a kindred spirit.

636
00:55:07,237 --> 00:55:11,606
I revealed the real me, that nobody knew.

637
00:55:21,051 --> 00:55:24,384
Is there anyone you want to kill?

638
00:55:31,661 --> 00:55:32,650
Please go away.

639
00:55:33,496 --> 00:55:35,623
Naoki, if you're there, listen to me!

640
00:55:35,832 --> 00:55:39,097
Withdrawing into yourself solves nothing!

641
00:55:44,574 --> 00:55:47,202
Unload all your problems on me.

642
00:55:47,811 --> 00:55:52,043
I'll solve them all. Believe me, Naoki!

643
00:55:52,515 --> 00:55:55,177
Be at school for the end of term tomorrow.

644
00:55:55,518 --> 00:55:56,951
We're waiting for you!

645
00:56:09,065 --> 00:56:11,761
Thank you for always coming with me.

646
00:56:23,012 --> 00:56:24,036
This Naoki...

647
00:56:25,115 --> 00:56:26,844
is no longer my Naoki.

648
00:56:27,951 --> 00:56:29,851
My gentle Naoki...

649
00:56:31,087 --> 00:56:32,577
he's gone.

650
00:56:37,794 --> 00:56:40,854
Dear Yoshihiko and Mariko,

651
00:56:42,232 --> 00:56:43,722
farewell...

652
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,331
and my apologies.

653
00:56:47,704 --> 00:56:51,765
I'll take Naoki and go on ahead.

654
00:57:09,225 --> 00:57:14,458
We're heading to heaven.

655
00:57:28,678 --> 00:57:30,236
Darling...

656
00:57:31,948 --> 00:57:35,543
Next day, the end of term meeting ended early,

657
00:57:36,419 --> 00:57:38,979
for an afternoon teacher's meeting.

658
00:57:40,757 --> 00:57:41,951
It seemed that Naoki

659
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:46,385
had killed his mother.

660
00:58:05,381 --> 00:58:08,578
Just tell the police exactly what happened.

661
00:58:10,253 --> 00:58:11,379
Yes.

662
00:58:14,924 --> 00:58:18,325
Miss... Miss Yuko,

663
00:58:19,596 --> 00:58:23,930
I'd like to ask you something.

664
00:58:25,134 --> 00:58:27,932
Is life really that precious?

665
00:58:30,473 --> 00:58:33,772
Really? Everybody's life?

666
00:58:43,386 --> 00:58:46,787
I'm collecting various drugs.

667
00:58:47,857 --> 00:58:49,154
I thought...

668
00:58:49,459 --> 00:58:51,825
maybe I'd use them to kill myself.

669
00:58:53,930 --> 00:58:59,698
But it'd be easy to put in Werther's tea, too.

670
00:59:01,271 --> 00:59:04,240
His life is not important.

671
00:59:05,275 --> 00:59:09,905
You felt the same about Naoki and Shuya.

672
00:59:11,648 --> 00:59:15,448
No, I can't believe that's true.

673
00:59:19,455 --> 00:59:22,253
But it's scary,

674
00:59:23,459 --> 00:59:25,723
to think there's a part of me

675
00:59:26,829 --> 00:59:29,195
that doesn't care if Werther dies.

676
00:59:32,068 --> 00:59:34,536
I told them everything.

677
00:59:35,572 --> 00:59:37,267
Naoki was driven into a corner.

678
00:59:37,473 --> 00:59:40,374
The reason he did what he did...

679
00:59:41,010 --> 00:59:42,204
All of it...

680
00:59:44,380 --> 00:59:46,348
was Werther's fault.

681
01:00:10,807 --> 01:00:15,767
Nobody told me that it was wrong to murder.

682
01:00:18,281 --> 01:00:22,581
Rather than picture books and
dream-filled fairy tales,

683
01:00:23,219 --> 01:00:26,052
my mom read Ohm's Law, Norton's Theorem

684
01:00:26,389 --> 01:00:29,324
always explaining electrical engineering.

685
01:00:30,727 --> 01:00:33,594
She'didismantle all my cute toys

686
01:00:39,302 --> 01:00:42,601
and explain the workings to me.

687
01:00:46,809 --> 01:00:50,939
My mother was a promising researcher in her field.

688
01:00:52,749 --> 01:00:56,742
But she married the dullest of guys

689
01:00:57,420 --> 01:00:58,819
and the kid they made,

690
01:00:59,722 --> 01:01:01,349
was me.

691
01:01:02,992 --> 01:01:05,961
In order to become my mother,

692
01:01:06,496 --> 01:01:10,899
she abandoned her bright future in research.

693
01:01:11,401 --> 01:01:13,767
You're an intelligent boy.

694
01:01:14,504 --> 01:01:17,302
You've got mom's blood in your veins.

695
01:01:21,978 --> 01:01:24,640
But she soon grew to regret it,

696
01:01:26,115 --> 01:01:28,049
and resent the cause,

697
01:01:28,484 --> 01:01:29,143
me...

698
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:30,816
Why don't you understand?

699
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:33,352
How come you can't do it?

700
01:01:39,162 --> 01:01:40,652
If only I hadn't had you.

701
01:01:41,064 --> 01:01:42,656
If only she hadn't had me...

702
01:01:45,268 --> 01:01:46,667
I'm sorry.

703
01:01:46,869 --> 01:01:51,067
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

704
01:01:52,041 --> 01:01:53,338
That's enough.

705
01:01:54,877 --> 01:01:58,005
Unable to bear it, my father divorced her.

706
01:01:59,248 --> 01:02:03,878
Mother resolved to restart
her career as a researcher.

707
01:02:04,654 --> 01:02:07,020
Of course, leaving me behind.

708
01:02:08,558 --> 01:02:11,152
All she left for me...

709
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:14,557
These wonderful books all
had a huge influence on me.

710
01:02:15,565 --> 01:02:17,396
They'll play a big role in your future.

711
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:20,626
I was a load of books and a parting line.

712
01:02:20,837 --> 01:02:23,237
You've got my blood in your veins.

713
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:26,770
You've definitely inherited your mother's genius.

714
01:02:31,814 --> 01:02:33,042
See you.

715
01:02:58,608 --> 01:03:02,135
That's when I heard it.

716
01:03:05,615 --> 01:03:09,483
The sound of something important disappearing forever.

717
01:03:10,286 --> 01:03:13,585
(Shuya Watanabe's Confession)

718
01:03:14,724 --> 01:03:15,816
Pop.

719
01:03:19,328 --> 01:03:20,886
Everyone disappears.

720
01:03:28,271 --> 01:03:29,670
You want some?

721
01:03:33,176 --> 01:03:34,666
I'll disappear, too.

722
01:03:36,445 --> 01:03:38,470
As will the world around me.

723
01:03:38,915 --> 01:03:40,143
All of it.

724
01:03:42,485 --> 01:03:44,544
31st August.

725
01:03:45,454 --> 01:03:47,888
I just rigged a bomb at the school.

726
01:03:55,298 --> 01:03:58,631
Its trigger is my cellphone.

727
01:04:01,437 --> 01:04:06,875
An essay of mine entitled "Life"
was selected by the school district.

728
01:04:07,243 --> 01:04:10,474
At tomorrow's opening ceremony,

729
01:04:10,947 --> 01:04:13,780
I'm due to read it in front of the entire school.

730
01:04:15,351 --> 01:04:17,182
"Appreciate how precious life is"!

731
01:04:19,055 --> 01:04:22,183
"I'll never forget Miss Moriguchi's words.

732
01:04:23,993 --> 01:04:26,894
"After losing her only daughter
in an unfortunate accident,

733
01:04:27,663 --> 01:04:28,630
"her words

734
01:04:30,867 --> 01:04:32,801
"and the truth within them... "

735
01:04:47,450 --> 01:04:49,850
I'll trigger the bomb just as I finish.

736
01:04:50,686 --> 01:04:55,521
Blasting myself and the idiots around me,
into smithereens.

737
01:04:58,427 --> 01:05:02,329
Of course the mass media will love it.

738
01:05:04,033 --> 01:05:05,193
However,

739
01:05:05,501 --> 01:05:08,993
I can't abide the trite analysis that'll follow.

740
01:05:09,672 --> 01:05:11,606
So I'm posting my last testament

741
01:05:12,808 --> 01:05:16,005
by myself on this website.

742
01:05:18,247 --> 01:05:22,149
My father remarried the following year.

743
01:05:23,686 --> 01:05:25,881
Per the laws of natural science,

744
01:05:26,088 --> 01:05:27,953
idiots mate with idiots

745
01:05:28,824 --> 01:05:30,018
and idiot offspring result.

746
01:05:30,226 --> 01:05:31,853
I talked it over with your dad.

747
01:05:32,061 --> 01:05:36,361
My idea is to make the stock room
into a study for you.

748
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:40,367
We don't want baby's cries to upset your studies.

749
01:05:52,515 --> 01:05:56,212
kept reading my mother's books,

750
01:05:57,119 --> 01:06:00,555
feeling our blood bond grow stronger.

751
01:06:02,291 --> 01:06:05,192
I wanted to employ the genius she'd bestowed.

752
01:06:05,828 --> 01:06:10,458
Dreams of useless normal people
bowing down before me,

753
01:06:11,133 --> 01:06:12,828
began to grow monstrously.

754
01:06:42,965 --> 01:06:44,023
What's this?

755
01:06:45,334 --> 01:06:46,596
A reverse alarm clock.

756
01:06:46,802 --> 01:06:50,465
These idiots I'd attracted with pledges
to de-censor porno

757
01:06:51,073 --> 01:06:55,806
could never appreciate the nature of my genius.

758
01:06:57,913 --> 01:07:01,640
(Genius Professor's Research Site)

759
01:07:01,675 --> 01:07:02,118
Firstly, I created a website,

760
01:07:02,118 --> 01:07:07,784
a gathering-place for prodigies
which I linked to my mother's college.

761
01:07:07,990 --> 01:07:13,121
"Engineering genius grade schooler posts
amazing inventions - check it out!"

762
01:07:13,329 --> 01:07:16,696
I thought maybe my mom would take a look.

763
01:07:19,902 --> 01:07:20,664
But...

764
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:22,462
Comments (0)

765
01:07:25,474 --> 01:07:26,338
Then I got mad,

766
01:07:28,511 --> 01:07:29,773
and posted all sorts of crap...

01:07:29,979 --> 01:07:33,142

Comments (181)

769
01:07:36,352 --> 01:07:37,751
What you did was OK.

770
01:07:41,957 --> 01:07:43,185
Yoshikazu Seguchi.

01:07:43,426 --> 01:07:44,393
(National Middle High School Science Fair)

772
01:07:44,593 --> 01:07:49,121
I was delighted to see that
name on the jury panel.

773
01:07:50,099 --> 01:07:54,365
He was a respected scientist and
a great influence on my mother.

774
01:07:55,304 --> 01:07:57,431
To think he might see my creations,

775
01:07:58,274 --> 01:08:02,438
would be a perfect test of my inherited genius.

776
01:08:03,179 --> 01:08:05,113
If selected for a prize,

777
01:08:05,714 --> 01:08:08,945
the news might make its way to her.

778
01:08:10,486 --> 01:08:13,046
I tested the prototype on my teacher.

779
01:08:13,589 --> 01:08:14,954
It passed with flying colors.

780
01:08:15,191 --> 01:08:18,456
I won the national award of excellence.

781
01:08:19,895 --> 01:08:20,759
However...

782
01:08:20,963 --> 01:08:22,296
(Middle School Girl Murders 4 Family Members)

783
01:08:22,331 --> 01:08:27,030
A local middle school girl is helping police
with their inquiries...

784
01:08:27,236 --> 01:08:29,727
A thing like that couldn't get
the world's attention.

785
01:08:30,172 --> 01:08:31,400
Nobody noticed,

786
01:08:31,974 --> 01:08:34,067
especially not my mother.

787
01:08:34,877 --> 01:08:38,813
I needed something bigger
the entire media would cover.

788
01:08:39,448 --> 01:08:41,075
A massive incident.

789
01:08:42,751 --> 01:08:44,150
A murder.

790
01:08:45,688 --> 01:08:48,248
Something that required my inherited talents.

791
01:08:48,457 --> 01:08:51,426
A special murder,

792
01:08:52,361 --> 01:08:53,988
only genius could carry out.

793
01:08:55,564 --> 01:08:57,464
It didn't matter who I killed.

794
01:08:57,700 --> 01:09:00,168
But I did need an accomplice.

795
01:09:01,570 --> 01:09:04,562
Someone who wouldn't guess my real thinking.

796
01:09:05,641 --> 01:09:07,768
Who would do as I say,

797
01:09:08,544 --> 01:09:13,004
then blurt out my crime to the entire world.

798
01:09:13,749 --> 01:09:15,512
A true idiot among idiots.

799
01:09:16,785 --> 01:09:17,774
There he was.

800
01:09:22,057 --> 01:09:25,117
You can tell everyone it was me who did it.

801
01:09:29,698 --> 01:09:31,689
Don't worry, you're not an accomplice.

802
01:09:32,635 --> 01:09:34,660
You were never my equal.

803
01:09:36,138 --> 01:09:38,470
you're a dumb-ass wimp.

804
01:09:38,974 --> 01:09:41,238
It's obvious you're a failure.

805
01:09:41,744 --> 01:09:44,235
I just told him the truth...

806
01:09:44,713 --> 01:09:47,011
Why did he have to do that?

807
01:09:47,216 --> 01:09:49,183
4 Year Old Drowns After Fall Into Pool

808
01:09:49,552 --> 01:09:50,484
Why did he butt in?

809
01:09:51,820 --> 01:09:53,947
I wanted to be your friend.

810
01:09:54,323 --> 01:09:55,051
I just...

811
01:09:55,791 --> 01:09:56,815
with you...

812
01:09:58,561 --> 01:09:59,892
I didn't have anyone.

813
01:10:00,563 --> 01:10:02,531
Want to come watch movies?

814
01:10:03,065 --> 01:10:05,499
I always wanted to talk to you.

815
01:10:05,701 --> 01:10:07,931
To think someone noticed me...

816
01:10:08,137 --> 01:10:10,230
You're different from those jerks.

817
01:10:10,806 --> 01:10:13,775
You seem relaxed... grown-up.

818
01:10:14,109 --> 01:10:17,237
Someone acknowledged me.

819
01:10:17,446 --> 01:10:20,472
So I chose a target, as you asked.

820
01:10:21,016 --> 01:10:22,483
How about her daughter?

821
01:10:22,685 --> 01:10:23,709
Why Manami?

822
01:10:24,186 --> 01:10:26,381
Why did she have to die?

823
01:10:26,622 --> 01:10:27,850
I wonder why?

824
01:10:28,157 --> 01:10:29,715
I've forgotten it now.

825
01:10:30,025 --> 01:10:31,515
I just did as I was told.

826
01:10:33,162 --> 01:10:35,153
I even surveyed the scene first.

827
01:10:36,332 --> 01:10:37,264
But then you...

828
01:10:37,466 --> 01:10:40,026
You can tell everyone it was me who did it.

829
01:10:40,236 --> 01:10:40,998
That jerk...

830
01:10:44,373 --> 01:10:46,933
He so wanted to be a murderer.

831
01:10:48,244 --> 01:10:49,211
But he couldn't do it.

832
01:10:49,979 --> 01:10:51,606
The kid was still alive.

833
01:10:51,947 --> 01:10:53,209
She was breathing properly.

834
01:10:54,383 --> 01:10:55,680
It's obvious you're a failure.

835
01:10:57,419 --> 01:10:58,818
A failure, huh?

836
01:10:59,388 --> 01:11:01,913
He wanted to kill but couldn't.

837
01:11:02,124 --> 01:11:03,216
He's the damn failure.

838
01:11:03,425 --> 01:11:04,619
Look who's talking.

839
01:11:04,827 --> 01:11:08,524
I managed to achieve

840
01:11:08,931 --> 01:11:10,694
what he couldn't.

841
01:11:14,536 --> 01:11:16,026
Why did you butt in?

842
01:11:16,805 --> 01:11:18,796
If you want to tell the world, feel free.

843
01:11:27,182 --> 01:11:28,149
Pop.

844
01:11:28,350 --> 01:11:32,047
After a month that idiot teacher finally twigged.

845
01:11:32,254 --> 01:11:36,247
I don't intend to rehash the police verdict.

846
01:11:36,458 --> 01:11:37,482
Damn it.

847
01:11:37,860 --> 01:11:41,057
What killed her wasn't the purse.

848
01:11:41,597 --> 01:11:46,091
It's incapable of stopping
even a 4 year old's heart.

849
01:11:46,302 --> 01:11:47,132
It sucks.

850
01:11:47,636 --> 01:11:51,333
Two of them had something extra mixed in.

851
01:11:52,508 --> 01:11:54,738
The HIV- infected blood of Dr. Sakuramiya.

852
01:12:07,489 --> 01:12:09,616
That was perfect, Moriguchi!

853
01:12:13,429 --> 01:12:14,487
A deadly disease...

854
01:12:14,930 --> 01:12:17,160
Perfect... if I contract that,

855
01:12:17,366 --> 01:12:20,597
Dad would surely have to tell Mom.

856
01:12:21,503 --> 01:12:23,494
He'd have to let me see her.

857
01:12:24,073 --> 01:12:27,099
Actually, she'd move mountains to come find me.

858
01:12:27,776 --> 01:12:30,540
We're reconciled, she looks after me...

859
01:12:31,413 --> 01:12:34,007
A perfect testament to my genius.

860
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:39,514
Pop.

861
01:12:41,690 --> 01:12:45,353
After that, I was just killing time.

862
01:12:49,565 --> 01:12:50,930
The smilling...

863
01:12:51,133 --> 01:12:51,929
The tears...

864
01:12:52,835 --> 01:12:54,427
All of it... that, too.

865
01:12:55,003 --> 01:12:56,868
Everything... life itself.

866
01:13:00,709 --> 01:13:02,370
Just meaningless...

867
01:13:03,879 --> 01:13:05,278
...a waste of time.

868
01:13:10,886 --> 01:13:14,083
I saw you by chance that day...

869
01:13:16,925 --> 01:13:18,392
Why did he do that?

870
01:13:19,361 --> 01:13:20,521
The retard.

871
01:13:21,497 --> 01:13:24,864
The one I considered a failure.

872
01:13:29,638 --> 01:13:31,196
It was Moriguchi's fault.

873
01:13:31,740 --> 01:13:33,731
She was trying to kill me.

874
01:13:34,610 --> 01:13:36,908
She even sent a spy to my home.

875
01:13:37,112 --> 01:13:40,240
Yet my mum kept bad-mouthing her to him.

876
01:13:40,449 --> 01:13:41,882
That's why she was killed.

877
01:13:43,285 --> 01:13:46,015
I desperately tried to stop her getting infected.

878
01:13:46,221 --> 01:13:48,348
To prevent her dying.

879
01:13:48,557 --> 01:13:49,888
I was going to be killed, too.

880
01:13:54,997 --> 01:13:56,259
I mean...

881
01:13:57,132 --> 01:13:58,895
Am I even alive?

882
01:14:01,771 --> 01:14:03,504
(Naoki Shimomura's confession)

883
01:14:03,539 --> 01:14:05,637
It certainly doesn't feel like it.

884
01:14:09,344 --> 01:14:10,106
I stink.

885
01:14:10,446 --> 01:14:13,006
But it's proof I'm alive.

886
01:14:13,215 --> 01:14:16,548
This hair, my nails, the dandruff, the stench...

887
01:14:16,752 --> 01:14:18,811
Being hungry... all proof I'm alive.

888
01:14:30,632 --> 01:14:33,032
I'm dying... I'm dying!

889
01:14:35,270 --> 01:14:36,066
I'm dying.

890
01:14:36,271 --> 01:14:37,260
At the age of just 13.

891
01:14:37,639 --> 01:14:39,072
Moriguchi's killing me.

892
01:14:39,274 --> 01:14:40,104
I've never kissed,

893
01:14:41,109 --> 01:14:41,803
or made out,

894
01:14:42,010 --> 01:14:43,602
or done anything.

895
01:14:44,613 --> 01:14:45,375
Why?

896
01:14:46,114 --> 01:14:47,479
You're such a failure.

897
01:14:47,683 --> 01:14:48,809
No, I'm not!

898
01:14:49,284 --> 01:14:50,012
I'm...

899
01:14:50,219 --> 01:14:51,811
Naoki, you're a good boy.

900
01:14:52,020 --> 01:14:53,282
Aren't I, Mom?

901
01:14:53,489 --> 01:14:55,548
Good at sport, at studying...

902
01:14:56,458 --> 01:14:57,948
At killing...

903
01:14:59,261 --> 01:15:00,819
You can succeed if you try.

904
01:15:13,242 --> 01:15:15,176
I'm so sorry, darling...

905
01:15:16,178 --> 01:15:16,974
Why?

906
01:15:18,347 --> 01:15:19,780
'Cause you're a failure.

907
01:15:19,982 --> 01:15:21,643
Shut up!

908
01:15:25,220 --> 01:15:26,517
I'm sorry.

909
01:15:27,422 --> 01:15:28,912
Your poor mom,

910
01:15:29,358 --> 01:15:32,156
she didn't bring you up right.

911
01:15:32,361 --> 01:15:33,191
Failure.

912
01:15:52,848 --> 01:15:54,611
According to his lawyer,

913
01:15:54,816 --> 01:15:59,276
the child apparently received
the court's verdict calmly.

914
01:15:59,888 --> 01:16:03,289
Miss, about "life"...

915
01:16:05,661 --> 01:16:07,288
To think how much he loved his mom...

916
01:16:08,530 --> 01:16:09,292
Silly jerk.

917
01:16:10,899 --> 01:16:11,957
Look who's talking.

918
01:16:15,037 --> 01:16:16,402
Nothing.

919
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:19,172
What do you mean by that?

920
01:16:20,175 --> 01:16:20,869
You're being scary.

921
01:16:21,076 --> 01:16:22,600
What the hell do you know?

922
01:16:26,715 --> 01:16:29,684
I know everything about you.

923
01:16:32,588 --> 01:16:36,422
You were just a way to kill time.

924
01:16:38,694 --> 01:16:39,820
But I was through.

925
01:16:40,796 --> 01:16:43,390
I'm sick of that "Lunacy" crap.

926
01:16:43,599 --> 01:16:47,057
And your longing to be like her.

927
01:16:47,402 --> 01:16:49,063
Collecting crap like this...

928
01:16:52,107 --> 01:16:53,768
You identify with Lunacy?

929
01:16:53,976 --> 01:16:57,537
You're just a wannabe, dreaming little dreams.

930
01:16:58,814 --> 01:16:59,803
You're an idiot.

931
01:17:00,015 --> 01:17:00,674
Shuya...

932
01:17:02,250 --> 01:17:04,275
You haven't got the courage to kill.

933
01:17:04,720 --> 01:17:07,780
Why not drink this and make a start?

934
01:17:14,196 --> 01:17:15,288
Mother complex.

935
01:17:17,132 --> 01:17:18,759
That's all you are.

936
01:17:20,235 --> 01:17:24,695
Hung up on a mother who abandoned you.

937
01:17:24,906 --> 01:17:26,703
Yet without the balls to go see her.

938
01:17:28,076 --> 01:17:31,341
Scared in case she rejects you, right?

939
01:17:31,546 --> 01:17:33,844
You know full well she abandoned you.

940
01:17:44,626 --> 01:17:46,059
Miss...

941
01:17:47,396 --> 01:17:51,025
I saw you by chance that day...

942
01:17:54,936 --> 01:17:56,335
I did.

943
01:18:30,672 --> 01:18:32,537
You didn't add anything, did you?

944
01:18:34,076 --> 01:18:36,169
I mean put blood in the milk.

945
01:18:38,046 --> 01:18:40,014
You'd never do that.

946
01:18:41,083 --> 01:18:42,516
So I always thought.

947
01:18:43,518 --> 01:18:45,782
Now I don't know anymore.

948
01:18:47,756 --> 01:18:49,849
Now I don't care if Werther dies.

949
01:18:50,058 --> 01:18:54,222
It seems Mr. Terada's taking time off school.

950
01:18:55,363 --> 01:18:58,230
Since Shimomura turned out like that.

951
01:18:58,667 --> 01:19:01,465
But it was Werther's fault...

952
01:19:01,670 --> 01:19:02,898
It was my fault.

953
01:19:04,272 --> 01:19:07,639
I'd meet up with him occasionally.

954
01:19:07,843 --> 01:19:09,367
He was so enthusiastic...

955
01:19:09,745 --> 01:19:11,372
...so pure-hearted...

956
01:19:11,913 --> 01:19:14,347
Such a Sakuramiya devotee.

957
01:19:15,884 --> 01:19:20,878
So I confessed the fact Sakuramiya
was Manami's father.

958
01:19:23,258 --> 01:19:26,056
I reeled him in and used him...

959
01:19:26,394 --> 01:19:28,487
to corner those boys.

960
01:19:33,568 --> 01:19:36,867
Of course I didn't tell him how Manami died.

961
01:19:37,139 --> 01:19:39,972
He listened to my advice so carefully.

962
01:19:40,542 --> 01:19:42,533
About home visits to Shimomura...

963
01:19:43,111 --> 01:19:47,673
"No matter how unpopular keep at it,
at least once a week... "

964
01:19:48,517 --> 01:19:51,111
"If the door's shut in your face, keep calling. "

965
01:19:51,720 --> 01:19:54,188
"Sakuramiya would do no less. "

966
01:19:55,290 --> 01:19:57,588
That's what I kept telling him.

967
01:19:59,895 --> 01:20:03,058
When he asked me about Watanabe's bullying,

968
01:20:04,065 --> 01:20:07,034
I told him to claim a student had reported it,

969
01:20:07,235 --> 01:20:09,726
to help bring it home to them.

970
01:20:11,773 --> 01:20:16,608
Knowing full well it'd promote further bullying.

971
01:20:18,046 --> 01:20:20,071
I said it on purpose.

972
01:20:21,983 --> 01:20:25,077
I was disappointed to hear it'd stopped.

973
01:20:25,821 --> 01:20:28,255
I counted on the cruelty of the class

974
01:20:28,824 --> 01:20:32,225
to result in his death or suicide.

975
01:20:33,361 --> 01:20:35,955
You guys were kinder than I thought.

976
01:20:36,164 --> 01:20:37,290
Miss...

977
01:20:39,901 --> 01:20:41,266
This is for you.

978
01:20:41,469 --> 01:20:42,595
Thank you.

979
01:20:51,112 --> 01:20:53,603
As to blood in their milk...

980
01:20:57,052 --> 01:20:59,748
"Don't repay hatred with hatred. "

981
01:21:01,289 --> 01:21:04,816
"That'll never bring peace of mind. "

982
01:21:06,528 --> 01:21:08,996
"Someday they'll be reformed. "

983
01:21:09,297 --> 01:21:11,060
"Believe in them. "

984
01:21:11,266 --> 01:21:15,635
"That'll bring your salvation, too. "

985
01:21:16,972 --> 01:21:19,133
That's what Sakuramiya said.

986
01:21:20,141 --> 01:21:20,971
To the very end,

987
01:21:22,377 --> 01:21:25,403
he kept saying the right thing.

988
01:21:26,882 --> 01:21:28,509
Whereas I...

989
01:21:32,621 --> 01:21:35,784
went ahead and told them anyway.

990
01:21:45,767 --> 01:21:48,395
But even if I'd actually done it.

991
01:21:49,037 --> 01:21:51,232
the chance of infection's practically zero.

992
01:21:55,010 --> 01:21:57,740
Even if you get AIDS,

993
01:21:58,046 --> 01:22:00,810
it's not a death sentence now.

994
01:22:01,750 --> 01:22:04,412
Drugs can ward off the disease.

995
01:22:05,854 --> 01:22:07,446
With Sakuramiya,

996
01:22:08,757 --> 01:22:13,592
if we'd found the cancer earlier,
he wouldn't have died.

997
01:22:16,865 --> 01:22:18,799
But you all had no idea...

998
01:22:20,568 --> 01:22:22,627
You quaked at the mention of HIV.

999
01:22:24,372 --> 01:22:26,465
So pathetic and clueless...

1000
01:22:34,883 --> 01:22:36,111
Miss...

1001
01:22:39,788 --> 01:22:42,313
I lost my family.

1002
01:22:45,060 --> 01:22:46,527
And Shuya...

1003
01:22:53,101 --> 01:22:54,693
I'll never forgive.

1004
01:22:57,005 --> 01:22:57,994
So?

1005
01:22:58,673 --> 01:23:01,073
Do you think I should die?

1006
01:23:01,476 --> 01:23:02,807
You don't understand.

1007
01:23:09,317 --> 01:23:11,785
Shuya's just lonely.

1008
01:23:12,253 --> 01:23:13,720
He just wants to be noticed...

1009
01:23:14,055 --> 01:23:15,113
...by his mother.

1010
01:23:17,258 --> 01:23:18,520
Because she left...

1011
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:20,928
'Cause his mom abandoned him...

1012
01:23:21,262 --> 01:23:24,663
he just needs recognition and...

1013
01:23:50,091 --> 01:23:51,353
Miss...

1014
01:23:53,428 --> 01:23:54,986
About life...

1015
01:23:57,298 --> 01:23:59,198
It's no big deal.

1016
01:26:04,159 --> 01:26:05,990
It's all so stupid.

1017
01:26:15,570 --> 01:26:17,299
She was still warm.

1018
01:26:18,006 --> 01:26:22,238
It was so creepy, I put the body in the fridge.

1019
01:26:24,245 --> 01:26:26,839
It's just a minor committing murder.

1020
01:26:27,115 --> 01:26:29,379
The juvenile penal code will protect me.

1021
01:26:29,918 --> 01:26:31,579
I won't get the death sentence.

1022
01:26:33,588 --> 01:26:34,555
What a let-down.

1023
01:26:36,157 --> 01:26:40,924
When I began building,
I wasn't sure how I'd use it.

1024
01:26:41,896 --> 01:26:42,590
Three days ago.

1025
01:26:42,797 --> 01:26:44,264
Associate Professor Yasaka

1026
01:26:44,465 --> 01:26:49,027
It was from my mother,
saying she wanted to meet.

1027
01:26:50,972 --> 01:26:54,169
Without a second thought,
I headed for her university.

1028
01:26:55,009 --> 01:26:59,173
Department of Science & Engineering,
Electrical Engineering Lab 3...

1029
01:27:01,649 --> 01:27:04,914
I saw her, just beyond the door.

1030
01:27:05,987 --> 01:27:08,581
If I'd just call out, tears would flow,

1031
01:27:09,591 --> 01:27:11,650
and she'd hug me to her.

1032
01:27:12,594 --> 01:27:13,583
But...

1033
01:27:15,129 --> 01:27:16,721
just then I had a realization.

1034
01:27:17,699 --> 01:27:21,931
What I wanted her to embrace,
wasn't this body of mine,

1035
01:27:22,971 --> 01:27:24,097
but something bigger,

1036
01:27:25,073 --> 01:27:27,439
my talent and...

1037
01:27:28,309 --> 01:27:31,039
...the great exploit I'd leave behind.

1038
01:27:31,980 --> 01:27:33,675
I walked away from the university.

1039
01:27:34,515 --> 01:27:36,346
In order to leave my mark on the world,

1040
01:27:38,553 --> 01:27:41,044
I'd found a use for my bomb.

1041
01:27:42,824 --> 01:27:44,689
The imminent mass murder,

1042
01:27:45,126 --> 01:27:48,653
won't have some idiot like
Shimomura for a witness,

1043
01:27:49,430 --> 01:27:52,490
but all of you who gather on this site.

1044
01:27:55,169 --> 01:27:57,364
The historical events of tomorrow,

1045
01:27:59,574 --> 01:28:00,632
my death too,

1046
01:28:01,409 --> 01:28:02,933
must be vouched for,

1047
01:28:03,711 --> 01:28:06,077
and my desires recorded,

1048
01:28:07,982 --> 01:28:11,076
for the benefit of my mother.

1049
01:28:21,763 --> 01:28:26,325
In this world, there are people
who can be forgiven for murder.

1050
01:28:27,168 --> 01:28:27,998
For them...

1051
01:28:29,570 --> 01:28:30,127
...for me, too.

1052
01:28:30,838 --> 01:28:32,999
...to build a better, new world,

1053
01:28:33,441 --> 01:28:36,205
there is a right to overstep certain obstacles.

1054
01:28:37,178 --> 01:28:40,739
That's what the hero of "Crime and Punishment"

1055
01:28:40,948 --> 01:28:44,406
Raskolnikov says before he kills the old woman.

1056
01:28:45,787 --> 01:28:47,414
But what I want to say is

1057
01:28:47,989 --> 01:28:48,614
that life...

1058
01:28:49,357 --> 01:28:50,619
every life... is precious,

1059
01:28:52,160 --> 01:28:54,287
every life is beautiful,

1060
01:28:55,296 --> 01:28:59,562
and in this world of ours,
every life has equal value!

1061
01:29:08,242 --> 01:29:09,709
Just kidding...

1062
01:29:58,192 --> 01:30:02,822
Darling, it's Mommy. Sorry you've been so lonely.

1063
01:30:03,030 --> 01:30:04,088
Who is this?

1064
01:30:05,199 --> 01:30:06,393
Long time, no see.

1065
01:30:06,601 --> 01:30:07,499
It's Moriguchi.

1066
01:30:08,169 --> 01:30:10,569
I have your bomb.

1067
01:30:11,005 --> 01:30:14,304
A simple thing put together by a simple mind.

1068
01:30:14,575 --> 01:30:16,702
It was a cinch to disarm.

1069
01:30:17,245 --> 01:30:19,304
You blabbered on the website...

1070
01:30:19,514 --> 01:30:20,208
Shut up!

1071
01:30:20,415 --> 01:30:21,177
No, I won't.

1072
01:30:22,683 --> 01:30:24,981
I want to discuss my revenge.

1073
01:30:25,420 --> 01:30:27,217
Simply killing you,

1074
01:30:27,789 --> 01:30:31,225
won't result in you despising your life.

1075
01:30:31,559 --> 01:30:32,526
Rather than murder.

1076
01:30:33,027 --> 01:30:37,259
I kept checking your website for a better idea.

1077
01:30:38,166 --> 01:30:42,398
Then I saw it, your ode to your mother.

1078
01:30:43,304 --> 01:30:44,737
But lying is wrong.

1079
01:30:46,140 --> 01:30:50,804
As your former teacher,
I must correct your mistruths.

1080
01:30:51,679 --> 01:30:54,614
The e-mail with your mother's address.

1081
01:30:55,583 --> 01:30:58,074
Did you think that was from her?

1082
01:30:58,286 --> 01:30:59,184
Mother...

1083
01:31:00,822 --> 01:31:04,087
You sure hurried over there the next day.

1084
01:31:04,292 --> 01:31:07,125
I saw her, just beyond the door.

1085
01:31:07,328 --> 01:31:09,558
Actually, you left without seeing her.

1086
01:31:09,797 --> 01:31:11,822
In order to leave my mark on the world.

1087
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:14,791
How could you lie like that?

1088
01:31:15,703 --> 01:31:16,897
You bitch.

1089
01:31:17,104 --> 01:31:19,902
You crept into her research lab,

1090
01:31:20,107 --> 01:31:25,977
clutching your crappy inventions
in the hope she'd take a look.

1091
01:31:26,914 --> 01:31:30,315
But she wasn't to be found.

1092
01:31:30,818 --> 01:31:33,651
Ain't that right, kiddo?

1093
01:31:40,595 --> 01:31:41,653
Hey.

1094
01:31:42,597 --> 01:31:43,894
What do you want?

1095
01:31:45,199 --> 01:31:48,999
This is Associate Professor Yasaka, right?

1096
01:31:50,137 --> 01:31:51,126
Do you know her?

1097
01:31:51,639 --> 01:31:54,403
The person I admire most in the world.

1098
01:31:55,276 --> 01:31:58,871
Yes, but her name's, Seguchi, now.

1099
01:31:59,213 --> 01:31:59,907
Seguchi?

1100
01:32:00,114 --> 01:32:03,675
These guys are on their honeymoon right now.

1101
01:32:04,185 --> 01:32:07,814
Amazing at their age... a shotgun marriage.

1102
01:32:08,155 --> 01:32:12,558
You chucked everything and
ran out of there, bawling.

1103
01:32:14,161 --> 01:32:15,219
Impressed that I know?

1104
01:32:15,930 --> 01:32:17,659
I was watching.

1105
01:32:20,034 --> 01:32:25,165
It was me who sent you
the address of her workplace.

1106
01:32:27,308 --> 01:32:28,605
Miss Kitahara,

1107
01:32:29,443 --> 01:32:31,604
the girl you killed,

1108
01:32:31,812 --> 01:32:34,280
she told me your one weakness.

1109
01:32:35,283 --> 01:32:37,080
Shuya's just lonely.

1110
01:32:37,852 --> 01:32:39,820
He just wants to be noticed,

1111
01:32:40,688 --> 01:32:41,882
by his mother.

1112
01:32:42,690 --> 01:32:43,850
I did some research.

1113
01:32:44,759 --> 01:32:46,727
It was easy to get the whereabouts,

1114
01:32:46,961 --> 01:32:50,658
of the woman you'd commit murder
to have notice you.

1115
01:32:50,865 --> 01:32:53,493
And to find out who she's with.

1116
01:32:53,701 --> 01:32:54,360
Shut up!

1117
01:32:57,538 --> 01:33:03,238
I wanted to check the extent of
your feelings with my own eyes.

1118
01:33:06,380 --> 01:33:11,113
After acting so cool, you were in a total mess.

1119
01:33:12,153 --> 01:33:13,381
Just then I had a realization...

1120
01:33:13,955 --> 01:33:16,355
That you'd been abandoned...

1121
01:33:16,557 --> 01:33:18,991
Worse, you'd been totally forgotten.

1122
01:33:19,193 --> 01:33:20,660
I walked away from the university.

1123
01:33:20,861 --> 01:33:24,888
Total despair. Time to die without more ado,

1124
01:33:25,499 --> 01:33:28,798
and take as many people with you as possible.

1125
01:33:30,438 --> 01:33:33,805
That's the real reason for planting the bomb.

1126
01:33:35,309 --> 01:33:36,139
Are you stupid?

1127
01:33:36,777 --> 01:33:39,143
You don't have a clue how I feel.

1128
01:33:39,347 --> 01:33:41,474
You're the one without a clue.

1129
01:33:42,717 --> 01:33:45,515
Why did innocent people have to die?

1130
01:33:45,886 --> 01:33:49,947
All you care about is your mother.

1131
01:33:50,157 --> 01:33:53,649
Why did Manami and Kitahara have to die?

1132
01:33:53,961 --> 01:33:55,428
It doesn't matter who I kill.

1133
01:33:55,630 --> 01:33:57,825
Then just kill your beloved mother.

1134
01:33:58,032 --> 01:33:59,192
Shut up!

1135
01:33:59,600 --> 01:34:01,465
Give that to me.

1136
01:34:10,611 --> 01:34:13,580
The police will be there soon.

1137
01:34:14,081 --> 01:34:16,948
Should've discovered Kitahara's body about now.

1138
01:34:18,519 --> 01:34:19,349
That poor kid...

1139
01:34:20,521 --> 01:34:22,455
She was the only one,

1140
01:34:23,024 --> 01:34:25,117
who knew what an arrogant weakling you are.

1141
01:34:25,559 --> 01:34:28,255
It's just a minor committing murder.

1142
01:34:28,529 --> 01:34:32,158
The penal code will protect me.
I won't get the death sentence.

1143
01:34:32,466 --> 01:34:34,696
Even if the law protects you,

1144
01:34:35,302 --> 01:34:37,532
I will never forgive.

1145
01:34:42,209 --> 01:34:44,177
This morning, after dismantling your bomb.

1146
01:34:46,347 --> 01:34:48,713
I went to see someone.

1147
01:34:50,217 --> 01:34:52,185
Taking with me,

1148
01:34:52,486 --> 01:34:54,147
your precious present.

1149
01:35:12,773 --> 01:35:15,799
This person that you'd been longing to see,

1150
01:35:16,010 --> 01:35:18,808
I was able to meet easily.

1151
01:35:20,281 --> 01:35:23,307
Apparently, she'd only just
returned from her honeymoon.

1152
01:35:28,322 --> 01:35:30,882
We talked about everything.

1153
01:35:31,158 --> 01:35:33,888
I told her how much you loved her.

1154
01:35:34,261 --> 01:35:37,355
How many had been sacrificed.

1155
01:35:38,199 --> 01:35:39,860
It turns out,

1156
01:35:40,701 --> 01:35:43,295
she'd not forgotten you at all.

1157
01:35:44,371 --> 01:35:45,235
Stop it.

1158
01:35:48,776 --> 01:35:52,303
At the very least, I gave her your present.

1159
01:35:53,848 --> 01:35:56,282
I dropped off your invention.

1160
01:35:57,218 --> 01:35:59,618
Then quickly said my goodbyes.

1161
01:36:29,617 --> 01:36:31,812
Your mother's a lovely woman.

1162
01:36:32,052 --> 01:36:35,453
So I prayed you wouldn't push the button.

1163
01:36:39,393 --> 01:36:40,485
But in the end...

1164
01:36:44,665 --> 01:36:45,859
...you went ahead.

1165
01:36:49,470 --> 01:36:50,937
Just kidding.

1166
01:36:59,246 --> 01:37:03,546
I heard the sound of
an important thing disappearing, too.

1167
01:37:06,620 --> 01:37:08,485
Not so much, "pop"...

1168
01:37:10,624 --> 01:37:12,023
...as "Boom!"

1169
01:37:20,901 --> 01:37:22,960
Shut up!

1170
01:41:34,855 --> 01:41:35,844
Mr. Watanabe,

1171
01:41:36,690 --> 01:41:40,649
the bomb was built and was activated

1172
01:41:40,861 --> 01:41:42,192
by you.

1173
01:42:25,606 --> 01:42:28,040
This is my revenge.

1174
01:42:31,945 --> 01:42:33,412
A living hell.

1175
01:42:50,030 --> 01:42:51,588
From now on,

1176
01:42:52,799 --> 01:42:56,860
your reformation begins, one step at a time.

1177
01:43:12,686 --> 01:43:14,313
Just kidding.
