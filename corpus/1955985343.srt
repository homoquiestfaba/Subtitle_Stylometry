What are you talking about?

01:20:22,640 --> 01:20:27,112
I had gotten into a fight with my parents,
so I went to your house.

1412
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:31,072
You weren't there,
so your dad let me in.

1413
01:20:31,920 --> 01:20:35,960
He was drinking,
and he offered me one, so I took it.

1414
01:20:37,680 --> 01:20:40,718
We had a few, and then he told me
that he had been fired that day

1415
01:20:40,880 --> 01:20:43,190
'cause he was
drinking on the job.

1416

would help him figure things out.

And then
he called me beautiful.

1419
01:21:01,120 --> 01:21:04,591
I was drunk, and I didn't know what to do,
and then he leaned in to kiss me...

I didn't do it, but he...

(SNIFFLES) He kept
coming back stronger.

Finally, I got free.

He begged me
to forgive him.

1424
01:21:20,280 --> 01:21:22,317
Said that he needed help,
but I was so scared.

1425

and I threatened to
tell you what happened,

1427

but he said that he would die
if you ever found out.

better off if he were dead.

01:37:35,760 --> 01:37:38,275
<i>Tell the truth,

1720
01:37:38,360 --> 01:37:39,794
<i>Refuse to play, you die.</i>

1721
01:37:39,880 --> 01:37:40,996
<i>It can happen anywhere.</i>

1722
01:37:41,080 --> 01:37:43,356

DISTORTED VOICE:
<i>Truth or dare?</i>
