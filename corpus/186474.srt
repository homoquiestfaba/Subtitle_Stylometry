1
00:00:42,483 --> 00:00:46,715
I would like to tell you
of something that happened.

2
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:51,885
Out of the desert
some people came.

3
00:00:52,226 --> 00:00:54,057
They were afraid.

4
00:00:54,395 --> 00:00:57,228
They never stopped being afraid.

5
00:00:58,866 --> 00:01:02,358
The journey had been a long one.

6
00:01:32,266 --> 00:01:33,290
Hi.

7
00:01:34,102 --> 00:01:35,126
Listen,

8
00:01:36,371 --> 00:01:37,895
I really need to pee.

9
00:01:39,941 --> 00:01:40,839
It's alright?

10
00:01:41,676 --> 00:01:42,836
No problem.

11
00:02:00,094 --> 00:02:00,856
Can't sleep?

12
00:02:22,717 --> 00:02:26,050
Ray, are you asleep?

13
00:02:26,854 --> 00:02:27,684
No.

14
00:02:28,389 --> 00:02:31,722
I think we should have waited
until they got the plane fixed.

15
00:02:31,859 --> 00:02:35,761
Look sweetie, it's still
in Sukana.. .believe me. ..

16
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:39,760
Did you get
the pictures developed?

17
00:02:40,668 --> 00:02:43,262
No. I'll do it
when we get home.

18
00:03:01,422 --> 00:03:03,720
Do you think we're ever going
to get there? What time is it?

19
00:03:03,991 --> 00:03:05,515
Honey, why don't you just.. .

20
00:03:05,893 --> 00:03:08,418
He's gotta be going the wrong way.

21
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:09,860
No, he's not going
the wrong way.

22
00:03:10,264 --> 00:03:12,232
Then why aren't we there yet?

23
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,791
Would you go and talk
to him? Please?

24
00:03:17,505 --> 00:03:18,403
Ray.. .

25
00:03:30,284 --> 00:03:31,751
Hey, how s it going?

26
00:03:33,621 --> 00:03:35,486
Travel this road a lot?

27
00:03:37,725 --> 00:03:39,454
No, I'm following that.

28
00:04:16,097 --> 00:04:16,722
Ray.

29
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:19,697
Ray.

30
00:04:34,015 --> 00:04:35,073
What are you doing?

31
00:04:35,783 --> 00:04:37,683
I can't find the water.

32
00:04:41,622 --> 00:04:42,554
Here you are.

33
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:48,592
Hey, hey, there s no reason
to worry, love.

34
00:04:48,729 --> 00:04:50,594
Everything's going as planned,
you'll see.

35
00:04:50,932 --> 00:04:52,524
We're just a bit delayed,
that s all.

36
00:04:53,467 --> 00:04:56,664
I m not really suited to
this kind of thing, Paul.

37
00:04:56,804 --> 00:04:57,896
'Course you are.

38
00:04:58,339 --> 00:05:00,398
It would have been
a much better idea.. .

39
00:05:00,541 --> 00:05:01,769
if you and your f ather
had come on your own.

40
00:05:01,909 --> 00:05:04,639
Rubbish. ..I wouldn't go out travelling
without you now would l, love?

41
00:05:05,813 --> 00:05:09,340
I'm only in the way. You'II
never get to know him like this.

42
00:05:09,483 --> 00:05:11,917
He's got to get
to know you too, alright?

43
00:05:16,557 --> 00:05:19,025
I can take care
of the pair of you, okay?

44
00:05:40,181 --> 00:05:41,443
Hey, where's the road?

45
00:05:42,116 --> 00:05:42,912
That's the road.

46
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:45,913
180 degrees due South.

47
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:59,598
This can't be the road to
Emerald Bay, it s a gravel path.

48
00:06:00,167 --> 00:06:00,758
It is the road.

49
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:02,426
C mon, sit down.
I'll deal with this.

50
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:04,094
Now will you please
go back to your seats.

51
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:06,206
C'mon, I'll deal with it! Dad!

52
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:08,136
Shut up a moment Paul,
will you please?

53
00:06:15,116 --> 00:06:16,174
Try turning again!

54
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:17,479
Why?

55
00:06:17,985 --> 00:06:20,010
Just try turning again, will you?

56
00:06:24,358 --> 00:06:25,655
That compass doesn't work.

57
00:06:27,662 --> 00:06:29,630
Look, we're almost out of petrol.

58
00:06:34,702 --> 00:06:36,169
I think you should
stop the bus.

59
00:06:38,205 --> 00:06:40,036
It'll be okay.
It II be okay. Look.

60
00:06:46,981 --> 00:06:48,414
What the hell is that?

61
00:07:28,889 --> 00:07:32,552
Can you come with me and help me
fill up the tank, please?

62
00:07:36,263 --> 00:07:37,093
Shit!

63
00:07:44,572 --> 00:07:46,164
Those bloody idiots!

64
00:07:46,774 --> 00:07:47,866
What the fuck do we do now?

65
00:07:48,943 --> 00:07:50,103
I don't know.

66
00:07:50,611 --> 00:07:52,238
You don't know? What do
you mean you don't know?

67
00:07:53,547 --> 00:07:55,742
You've gotta have some kind of
instructions on what to do if.. .

68
00:07:55,883 --> 00:07:57,783
something like this happens!

69
00:07:57,918 --> 00:08:00,580
You've gotta have some kind of
emergency plan for Christ s sake.

70
00:08:00,721 --> 00:08:01,278
I'm sorry.

71
00:08:01,922 --> 00:08:04,550
Let s go over to one of those
houses and see if anyone's there.

72
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,867
What in the hell s he doing?

73
00:08:16,203 --> 00:08:18,364
He's wetting himself
I would imagine.

74
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:20,067
The jerricans are empty !

75
00:08:20,408 --> 00:08:21,966
- This blasted developing country!
- What?

76
00:08:22,109 --> 00:08:24,077
And that idiot thinks
he can find somebody !

77
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:30,242
He's met someone!

78
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:32,785
C'mon, c mon, let s help him!

79
00:08:33,421 --> 00:08:34,285
Ray.

80
00:08:42,296 --> 00:08:44,890
Hey, should I wake
this guy or...?

81
00:08:45,366 --> 00:08:46,333
Yes.

82
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:52,664
Hi.

83
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:54,438
What's happened?

84
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:57,476
Well, we.. .um...we went off
course a bit, but now they...

85
00:08:57,611 --> 00:09:00,603
found a guy and gas and they're
just filling up the tank so.

86
00:09:01,248 --> 00:09:01,839
Gas?

87
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:03,839
Yeah.

88
00:09:08,322 --> 00:09:09,152
Careful of your back.

89
00:09:09,457 --> 00:09:12,722
Okay, one...two. ..three!

90
00:09:20,067 --> 00:09:21,728
You can't drive on that stuff.

91
00:09:22,136 --> 00:09:22,795
Why not?

92
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:23,596
It s kerosene!

93
00:09:24,305 --> 00:09:26,102
Most buses can manage fine on it.

94
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:38,142
Alright, everybody
back on the bus!

95
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:54,597
Avoid panicking, never panic!
That's the thing. That's the trick.

96
00:09:54,735 --> 00:09:56,202
Keep a clear head.
Know what I mean?

97
00:10:04,278 --> 00:10:05,040
C mon!

98
00:10:12,853 --> 00:10:13,820
Oh my God!

99
00:10:18,626 --> 00:10:19,650
C mon!

100
00:10:32,339 --> 00:10:33,829
You can't just drag me
and my family out into...

101
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:35,134
the middle of the fucking desert,

102
00:10:35,276 --> 00:10:36,368
and leave me with a bunch of
strangers, do you understand?

103
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,501
Driver, driver, try it again,
will you?

104
00:10:39,813 --> 00:10:40,780
Where are you going?

105
00:10:41,048 --> 00:10:42,675
Don't you run away
you fucking idiot!

106
00:10:42,816 --> 00:10:43,612
Leave him alone.

107
00:10:43,751 --> 00:10:44,615
Don't you fucking touch me.

108
00:10:44,752 --> 00:10:46,720
Okay, okay, okay.
Let's just calm down. ..

109
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:48,583
we're going to find a phone
and we'll call for help.

110
00:10:48,722 --> 00:10:50,622
There's no telephone here.

111
00:10:50,925 --> 00:10:52,790
Well, yea, but I m sure
somebody's got a cell phone!

112
00:10:52,927 --> 00:10:55,452
No, but you can't get a signal
out here, you moron!

113
00:10:55,596 --> 00:10:57,393
Who are you calling a moron,
you fat fuck!

114
00:10:57,531 --> 00:10:58,395
Oh, shut your face.

115
00:10:58,532 --> 00:11:01,797
Excuse me, this is
a no smoking bus...Ray!

116
00:11:02,002 --> 00:11:04,994
Why are you calling me a moron
because I have a fucking idea?

117
00:11:05,139 --> 00:11:06,401
Paul, Paul. ..sit down,
would you?

118
00:11:18,586 --> 00:11:20,110
May I have your attention please?

119
00:11:21,522 --> 00:11:22,955
We might as well face it.

120
00:11:24,024 --> 00:11:25,457
We're going to be here
some time.

121
00:11:25,593 --> 00:11:27,220
Well, I can't.
I have to get home.

122
00:11:27,428 --> 00:11:29,225
Yes, well that won't be
right away.

123
00:11:29,363 --> 00:11:32,127
But. ..someone must come along!
What about him?

124
00:11:33,033 --> 00:11:36,002
His name is Kanana.
Don't count on him.

125
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:39,537
He's lived out here ever since
the Germans closed the mine.

126
00:11:39,673 --> 00:11:43,404
We can't count on anyone just
coming along either.

127
00:11:44,111 --> 00:11:46,272
There hasn't been any traffic
through here for years.

128
00:11:46,413 --> 00:11:47,175
I don't want to be here.

129
00:11:47,314 --> 00:11:49,509
I have to get home.
I have appointments...

130
00:11:50,317 --> 00:11:51,545
Someone must be looking for us.

131
00:11:51,685 --> 00:11:52,709
Look,

132
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:57,486
I think we've driven at least
500 miles in the wrong direction...

133
00:11:57,925 --> 00:12:01,918
We've got to get going right
away! Let s leave right now!

134
00:12:02,062 --> 00:12:02,721
Let's go!

135
00:12:03,063 --> 00:12:06,965
Well, be my guest! It s about
150 miles to the nearest village.

136
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:10,002
Well, we've gotta do something!
We have to walk!

137
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:12,401
If I m not home within 25 hours,

138
00:12:12,539 --> 00:12:13,938
you have no idea
what s going to happen.. .

139
00:12:14,074 --> 00:12:14,904
Shut up!

140
00:12:15,142 --> 00:12:16,234
And sit down!

141
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:23,515
Sir, we can't just sit here
and do nothing.

142
00:12:24,051 --> 00:12:27,612
You know. Can't somebody
go and get some help?

143
00:12:29,023 --> 00:12:34,325
Well, there is a small village
about 35 degrees east of here.

144
00:12:34,461 --> 00:12:35,257
It's in that direction.

145
00:12:35,529 --> 00:12:37,554
I'd like to go! I'll go!

146
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:39,425
No fucking chance!

147
00:12:40,234 --> 00:12:42,464
You couldn't find your way
out of a public toilet!

148
00:12:45,506 --> 00:12:48,066
It should take me
about 4 or 5 days.

149
00:12:48,442 --> 00:12:52,970
Sir, you can't go, you can't.
We need you here, uh, Mr. ...

150
00:12:53,113 --> 00:12:54,102
My name is Jack.

151
00:12:54,448 --> 00:12:55,210
We need you here.

152
00:12:55,616 --> 00:13:00,110
Look I'm the only one
who stands a chance out there.

153
00:13:02,289 --> 00:13:03,119
Well, what about us?

154
00:13:03,257 --> 00:13:05,657
Excuse me madam,
do you understand this?

155
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:07,453
Excuse me?

156
00:13:07,594 --> 00:13:09,027
This is a serious situation!

157
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:10,596
Am I right?
This is a serious situation.

158
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:12,397
Oh, it's deadly serious.

159
00:13:14,802 --> 00:13:17,669
There are five rules
for surviving in the desert.

160
00:13:18,605 --> 00:13:19,799
We get water,

161
00:13:20,541 --> 00:13:21,803
gather food reserves,

162
00:13:21,942 --> 00:13:23,170
build a shelter,

163
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:25,009
remain visible,

164
00:13:25,913 --> 00:13:27,847
and keep our spirits up!

165
00:13:27,981 --> 00:13:32,441
At night, dew f alls and
that s going to save us.

166
00:13:33,554 --> 00:13:35,886
The dew will form on the roofs.

167
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:38,958
We're going to have to rig up
some sort of containers.. .

168
00:13:39,093 --> 00:13:41,061
and catch every last drop of it.

169
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:44,756
That ought to ensure enough
drinking water for everyone.

170
00:13:44,898 --> 00:13:46,627
With regard to food,

171
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:49,391
there are some old boxes
behind Kanana's house.

172
00:13:49,536 --> 00:13:50,901
They're filled with these.

173
00:13:52,172 --> 00:13:53,298
Carrots.

174
00:13:54,641 --> 00:13:57,010
But it s important
that you don't eat the dented ones.

175
00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:58,739
They could be poisonous.

176
00:13:58,979 --> 00:14:00,412
Now, shelter.

177
00:14:01,582 --> 00:14:05,074
I can tell you that it gets
extremely cold out here at night,

178
00:14:05,853 --> 00:14:08,287
so I recommend
that you each pick a house.

179
00:14:08,489 --> 00:14:10,047
There are plenty to choose from.

180
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:14,455
It may be that a plane
may fly overhead.

181
00:14:14,661 --> 00:14:17,824
So I suggest that we pull off
one of the wing mirrors off the bus,

182
00:14:17,965 --> 00:14:20,661
and use it to signal to them
using the sun.

183
00:14:21,835 --> 00:14:27,569
At night, we remain visible by
having a fire burning constantly.

184
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:30,403
We're going to have to work out
some sort of rota. ..

185
00:14:30,544 --> 00:14:32,512
so that we have
at least two people...

186
00:14:32,646 --> 00:14:36,138
watching the fire and making
sure that it never goes out.

187
00:14:36,283 --> 00:14:37,614
But above all,

188
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:41,312
we must stay positive
and keep our spirits up!

189
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:44,521
You got it?

190
00:14:49,329 --> 00:14:50,728
And in the meantime,

191
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:54,659
I suggest you find a suitable
spot and dig yourselves a hole.

192
00:14:55,135 --> 00:14:56,102
What for?

193
00:14:56,703 --> 00:14:57,601
Feces!

194
00:15:29,803 --> 00:15:32,271
This is the holiday
I've always dreamed about.

195
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:35,331
Go out into the middle of
the desert and dig a hole. ..

196
00:15:36,543 --> 00:15:39,671
as long as there's shit,
there's hope.

197
00:15:47,454 --> 00:15:49,752
You know, there's something
I like about that driver.

198
00:15:50,357 --> 00:15:52,120
He knows he's full of shit.

199
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,791
Look at the size of the hole
he's digging!

200
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:16,414
Hey, these holes are
too close together.

201
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:18,074
Move them further apart.

202
00:16:18,652 --> 00:16:19,482
Why?

203
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:21,554
Spread of infection.

204
00:16:22,623 --> 00:16:23,612
Look,

205
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:26,991
if I'm not back in 5 days,

206
00:16:28,328 --> 00:16:31,820
take the tires off the bus and burn
them up on that ridge somewhere.

207
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,591
Black smoke can be seen
a long way off.

208
00:16:35,736 --> 00:16:37,294
Why don't we do it now then?

209
00:16:40,908 --> 00:16:43,433
You never let all your ammo off
in one go.

210
00:16:47,281 --> 00:16:48,373
Five days.

211
00:16:48,849 --> 00:16:50,009
Five days.

212
00:17:49,042 --> 00:17:51,306
Hey! Charlie boy !

213
00:17:51,645 --> 00:17:53,704
Coming in?
There's plenty of booze left.

214
00:17:54,681 --> 00:17:56,512
Shouldn't you
be looking after the fire?

215
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:59,483
Henry's happy to watch it
on his own for a while.

216
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:02,180
Paul needs to relax a bit.

217
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:04,580
In your own time then.

218
00:18:19,373 --> 00:18:21,534
That's not the way
to dance to this stuff !

219
00:18:23,944 --> 00:18:26,037
How are we supposed to dance
to it then?

220
00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:27,871
You remember the film?

221
00:18:28,548 --> 00:18:30,914
John Travolta
and Olivia Newton John?

222
00:18:36,957 --> 00:18:39,357
Olivia Newton John
wasn't in it.

223
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,184
I'll be John Travolta.

224
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:45,559
That was Grease!

225
00:18:45,799 --> 00:18:47,323
It s a great film!

226
00:18:47,534 --> 00:18:51,470
That's not Grease.
That's Saturday Night Fever!

227
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:54,470
Oh yeah, that was
a good film as well!

228
00:19:02,582 --> 00:19:03,606
Caught you!

229
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:06,816
I caught you.
I saw you looking!

230
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:10,550
You're just like all the
other guys.. . aren't you Ray,

231
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:13,489
it s tits and ass isn't it?
Huh?

232
00:19:13,627 --> 00:19:14,787
Ass and tits!

233
00:19:17,397 --> 00:19:19,331
You're just better
at hiding it aren't you?

234
00:19:27,874 --> 00:19:31,810
What is it that really
turns you on? Huh?

235
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:35,048
C'mon, is it tits
or is it ass?

236
00:19:36,883 --> 00:19:37,941
Tits!

237
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:44,991
Believe me honey I know
the magnetic power of tits.

238
00:20:01,808 --> 00:20:02,866
Gravity.

239
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:36,007
Is there anybody?

240
00:20:38,578 --> 00:20:39,875
Pull me up.

241
00:20:44,551 --> 00:20:45,643
Hello my friend!

242
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:47,515
Hey sexy guy!

243
00:20:47,654 --> 00:20:48,416
Mon amie.

244
00:20:48,555 --> 00:20:51,422
C'mon! Get down
to the funky groove...

245
00:20:51,558 --> 00:20:53,389
Shhh...

246
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:55,584
Let him work!

247
00:20:55,829 --> 00:20:58,923
Remember, he is a serious man.

248
00:21:05,705 --> 00:21:08,367
Now you come inside and party.

249
00:21:08,508 --> 00:21:10,203
Don't stay out here
all by yourself.

250
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:11,906
I've never been
much of a dancer.

251
00:21:12,546 --> 00:21:14,878
C'mon...give him a drink.

252
00:21:15,849 --> 00:21:17,043
No thanks.

253
00:21:17,284 --> 00:21:18,251
C'mon.. .

254
00:21:18,518 --> 00:21:20,679
You do as you're told. Okay?

255
00:21:21,021 --> 00:21:22,113
Drink!

256
00:21:24,591 --> 00:21:26,058
A real drink!

257
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:28,457
Okay, okay.

258
00:21:28,595 --> 00:21:33,999
Okay. Okay. Okay.
Okay. Okay...

259
00:21:34,434 --> 00:21:38,336
Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. ..

260
00:22:01,428 --> 00:22:07,128
Out here there is silence.

261
00:22:08,101 --> 00:22:14,370
For days they waited for the man
who walked into the desert.

262
00:22:15,275 --> 00:22:19,177
I don't think they talked about him.

263
00:22:19,312 --> 00:22:22,543
They didn't understand
the desert.

264
00:23:05,625 --> 00:23:06,922
Assholes.

265
00:23:08,128 --> 00:23:10,187
Fucking assholes.

266
00:23:11,197 --> 00:23:14,530
Repairing a roof out here
in dead-mans-land.

267
00:23:24,644 --> 00:23:26,111
It won't be long
before we'll be...

268
00:23:26,346 --> 00:23:28,974
fighting each other
for a drop of water.

269
00:23:30,684 --> 00:23:32,914
Killing for a carrot.

270
00:23:36,056 --> 00:23:42,120
Some fantastic striptease
act of human needs.

271
00:23:53,273 --> 00:23:55,468
Is man no more than this?

272
00:24:07,787 --> 00:24:09,914
It's good old Lear again.

273
00:24:21,601 --> 00:24:22,795
Perfect!

274
00:24:25,305 --> 00:24:26,397
.. .death,

275
00:24:28,742 --> 00:24:29,640
dearth.

276
00:24:30,243 --> 00:24:31,710
menaces.. .

277
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:38,940
and maledictions against a king.. .

278
00:24:40,186 --> 00:24:43,019
and nobles.

279
00:24:44,958 --> 00:24:46,619
Am I disturbing you?

280
00:24:49,462 --> 00:24:50,326
No, no.

281
00:24:58,738 --> 00:25:01,104
Have you got a book
I can borrow?

282
00:25:01,374 --> 00:25:02,841
I can't sleep.

283
00:25:03,676 --> 00:25:06,907
Yes, but they're in English.

284
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,674
No choice.

285
00:25:21,828 --> 00:25:23,955
Do you know
why it's called a role?

286
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:25,162
Pardon?

287
00:25:26,332 --> 00:25:29,961
In the theatre. Do you know
why it's called a role?

288
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:31,835
It must be French.

289
00:25:31,971 --> 00:25:35,202
No. It doesn't have anything
to do with France.

290
00:25:36,342 --> 00:25:39,709
A long time ago, when things
were written by hand.. .

291
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:43,841
Ex cuse me,
have you got a light?

292
00:25:45,051 --> 00:25:48,509
In order to avoid
having to write a whole play

293
00:25:48,721 --> 00:25:52,088
out several times, each player
was given his own role.

294
00:26:01,801 --> 00:26:02,995
"Space Killers"?

295
00:26:03,536 --> 00:26:06,437
Oh, no, you're reading
the wrong side.

296
00:26:08,441 --> 00:26:10,238
Did you write this Henry?

297
00:26:10,944 --> 00:26:13,936
No.. .I'm paid to read
that stuff. Turn it over.

298
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:24,486
"I cannot heave my heart
into my mouth."

299
00:26:26,059 --> 00:26:27,822
"I love your Majesty..."

300
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:29,451
That's Cordelia.

301
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:30,861
It s Othello?

302
00:26:31,064 --> 00:26:33,089
No. It's Lear.

303
00:26:39,038 --> 00:26:41,563
Are you writing King Lear
by hand?

304
00:26:41,708 --> 00:26:44,040
Well, as much as
I can remember of it.

305
00:26:44,744 --> 00:26:47,577
Or what I think I can remember.

306
00:26:48,214 --> 00:26:49,238
Why not.

307
00:26:51,251 --> 00:26:52,843
Just imagine...

308
00:26:53,553 --> 00:26:55,646
if we could put on King Lear
out here.

309
00:26:56,322 --> 00:27:00,258
In this godforsaken place
with all these lost souls.

310
00:27:01,394 --> 00:27:03,123
They couldn't learn
these things.

311
00:27:03,696 --> 00:27:04,390
Maybe not.

312
00:27:05,431 --> 00:27:08,366
They d probably rather sit
and stare into thin air.

313
00:27:08,501 --> 00:27:09,763
That's okay.

314
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:12,467
We're on holiday, aren't we?

315
00:27:12,605 --> 00:27:13,697
Oh really?

316
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:21,379
Actually, I was thinking
that you could play Cordelia?

317
00:27:33,526 --> 00:27:36,461
I II take one of your books,
okay?

318
00:29:11,124 --> 00:29:13,558
What s it like living
with somebody like Paul?

319
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:19,931
Drive you mad does it?

320
00:29:29,742 --> 00:29:31,642
You should keep yourself
in shape.

321
00:29:36,082 --> 00:29:37,049
I do.

322
00:29:38,885 --> 00:29:41,080
I play a bit of football
now and again.

323
00:29:47,627 --> 00:29:49,322
Where the fuck is Jack?

324
00:29:59,038 --> 00:30:01,472
They re talking about
doing a play out here.

325
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:09,106
Have you heard that?

326
00:30:15,621 --> 00:30:18,283
Those carrots must be
getting to us, huh?

327
00:30:21,327 --> 00:30:23,352
I mean, what idiot would
want to take part in that?

328
00:30:23,496 --> 00:30:24,793
It s bloody ridiculous.

329
00:30:28,301 --> 00:30:29,290
I will.

330
00:30:35,908 --> 00:30:38,741
Paul, your capacity for
self-degradation is really. ..

331
00:30:38,878 --> 00:30:39,970
quite formidable.

332
00:30:42,749 --> 00:30:46,378
And what about you, Amanda?
Are you going to join in?

333
00:30:47,987 --> 00:30:48,919
I. ..

334
00:30:49,555 --> 00:30:50,283
I'm sorry. What did you say?

335
00:30:50,423 --> 00:30:52,414
I don't think
there are any more parts.

336
00:30:54,127 --> 00:30:56,254
Well, lucky old you.

337
00:30:57,063 --> 00:30:57,722
Don't worry.

338
00:30:59,499 --> 00:31:01,694
I'II make sure there's a
part in the play for you love.

339
00:31:01,834 --> 00:31:03,324
Well, if there aren't
any more parts,

340
00:31:03,469 --> 00:31:05,369
then there's nothing
you can do about it.

341
00:31:05,671 --> 00:31:06,865
Well, if you're not in it,
then neither am I...

342
00:31:07,006 --> 00:31:09,702
Well, I don't want you
to embarrass me...

343
00:31:09,842 --> 00:31:11,833
I'll tell him straight!

344
00:31:16,983 --> 00:31:17,915
Tell who?

345
00:31:20,953 --> 00:31:21,977
Henry!

346
00:31:31,764 --> 00:31:32,662
Good,

347
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:34,494
that's good.

348
00:31:38,671 --> 00:31:44,109
Now surely some tribal
chieftain will see that.. .

349
00:31:45,711 --> 00:31:46,939
God willing.

350
00:31:57,023 --> 00:32:00,481
You know. I hate party games. ..

351
00:32:01,661 --> 00:32:03,094
and I'm not going to. ..

352
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:08,396
participate in some
kind of silly group therapy.. .

353
00:32:09,969 --> 00:32:14,429
and I don't care if
everybody's doing it. ..

354
00:32:14,674 --> 00:32:17,438
and I don't care
if only the bugs are watching...

355
00:32:19,245 --> 00:32:21,304
they're going to eat us anyway.. .

356
00:32:21,647 --> 00:32:22,841
Practicing your lines?

357
00:32:26,085 --> 00:32:26,744
No.

358
00:32:34,293 --> 00:32:36,022
That's what I want to
talk to you about.

359
00:32:37,063 --> 00:32:38,030
What?

360
00:32:39,899 --> 00:32:40,923
I mean, the play.

361
00:32:42,201 --> 00:32:43,065
Yeah?

362
00:32:47,106 --> 00:32:48,596
I mean, what s it all about?

363
00:32:56,849 --> 00:33:00,683
Well, it s about a King,
who has two daughters.. .

364
00:33:02,622 --> 00:33:04,021
or maybe it's three,
I'm not really sure.

365
00:33:04,156 --> 00:33:05,555
But anyway,
he has a couple of kids.

366
00:33:07,026 --> 00:33:09,221
And he's old
and he wants to retire...

367
00:33:09,362 --> 00:33:13,298
and he wants to divide
his kingdom between his kids,

368
00:33:15,301 --> 00:33:17,428
so whoever says
they love him the most. ..

369
00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:19,629
gets the biggest share.
That's it.

370
00:33:20,139 --> 00:33:23,370
And you get the chance
to be the evil daughter, right?

371
00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:25,668
Sure.

372
00:33:27,246 --> 00:33:28,975
I get to play the real bitch.

373
00:33:29,582 --> 00:33:31,015
You don't have to worry
you know,

374
00:33:31,717 --> 00:33:34,686
nobody has to f all in love and
everybody gets to die in the end.

375
00:34:11,157 --> 00:34:12,556
Are you too tired?

376
00:34:13,092 --> 00:34:15,925
No. I'm not tired.

377
00:34:17,530 --> 00:34:19,862
How about if it was in French?

378
00:34:21,133 --> 00:34:23,033
You could talk to me in French.

379
00:34:25,071 --> 00:34:26,698
What do you want me to say?

380
00:34:26,839 --> 00:34:29,069
Say...I m French.

381
00:34:29,742 --> 00:34:32,233
And I like to boogie
on down baby !

382
00:34:35,514 --> 00:34:37,106
"I'm French, "

383
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:40,209
"and I am fed up with you
sticking to my ass. '

384
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:44,112
That's so excellent.

385
00:34:47,426 --> 00:34:48,415
More!

386
00:34:49,328 --> 00:34:49,919
What?

387
00:34:51,197 --> 00:34:52,425
Tell me a story.

388
00:35:02,708 --> 00:35:04,107
"Once upon a time, '

389
00:35:04,877 --> 00:35:09,143
"an old man was lost
in the desert.'

390
00:35:11,751 --> 00:35:13,480
'After several days, "

391
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:17,747
' he got so bored he was
ripping his balls off."

392
00:35:18,924 --> 00:35:22,382
' So he got this crazy idea. .. '

393
00:35:22,595 --> 00:35:26,497
"of staging King Lear in the
middle of a shit-hole of a desert. '

394
00:35:29,568 --> 00:35:30,592
' At first, '

395
00:35:32,104 --> 00:35:38,532
"he asked the French chick to be in
because the old retard..."

396
00:35:38,778 --> 00:35:41,440
' got a hard on at the thought
of her tight little ass. '

397
00:35:42,848 --> 00:35:45,749
' Sadly, she turned him down. .. '

398
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,845
'Seeing he'd blown his chances
of screwing the intellectual, "

399
00:35:52,058 --> 00:35:55,027
'he decided to try his luck
with the Yankee bitch."

400
00:35:56,295 --> 00:36:00,163
'The cow's immense joy was
as great as her stupidity."

401
00:36:03,302 --> 00:36:08,262
"Wow! Great! A real play ! "

402
00:36:10,476 --> 00:36:15,743
"And maybe the old dickhead's
idea wasn't so bad, "

403
00:36:18,317 --> 00:36:20,308
'because thanks to
her pretty little ass.. ."

404
00:36:20,619 --> 00:36:22,450
' he'd got to attract
the other guys."

405
00:36:26,592 --> 00:36:27,684
"And there you go! "

406
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:32,590
What was it about?

407
00:36:33,299 --> 00:36:34,789
It was a fairy tale.

408
00:36:35,434 --> 00:36:36,901
It's beautiful!

409
00:36:43,476 --> 00:36:47,913
I can say they were afraid but
they didn't hold each other.

410
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:50,774
They began to say words.

411
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:54,647
Words made them forget.

412
00:36:54,787 --> 00:36:58,052
For a while they went round
and said words...

413
00:36:58,190 --> 00:37:00,556
without talking to each other.

414
00:37:00,693 --> 00:37:02,888
Henry listened.

415
00:37:03,662 --> 00:37:07,393
In two our kingdom, and it's. ..
tis our firm intent.

416
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:11,559
To share all cares
and business from our Age.

417
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:15,229
Passing then on to younger
strengths, While we Unburthen'd. ..

418
00:37:15,441 --> 00:37:18,968
crawl toward death.
And now, My daughters,

419
00:37:19,545 --> 00:37:21,809
doth love us most? Goneril,

420
00:37:22,448 --> 00:37:24,075
our eldest-born, speak first.

421
00:37:28,554 --> 00:37:31,114
I love you more than
words can wield the matter.

422
00:37:31,257 --> 00:37:33,953
Beyond what is regarded
rich and rare.

423
00:37:36,328 --> 00:37:39,024
No less than life,
with grace, and. ..

424
00:37:39,532 --> 00:37:41,966
honey, would you quit with
the paper. Please, thank you.

425
00:37:42,268 --> 00:37:44,327
I am opposed to any other joy. ..

426
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:46,836
which the most precious square
of sense Possesses.

427
00:37:46,972 --> 00:37:50,703
And find. I am alone facilitate
in your love...

428
00:37:50,843 --> 00:37:52,003
Felicitate.

429
00:37:53,512 --> 00:37:54,877
Yeah, sorry.

430
00:37:55,848 --> 00:37:58,840
As much I am alone prefer.. .

431
00:37:58,984 --> 00:38:01,544
as much as child e'er loved,
or father found.

432
00:38:01,687 --> 00:38:04,850
A love that turns all speech
to idle breath.

433
00:38:04,990 --> 00:38:07,356
Beyond all manner of all this
I love You.

434
00:38:10,696 --> 00:38:12,926
Henry, can I sit down?
I m feeling rather poorly.

435
00:38:13,132 --> 00:38:15,896
Yes, of course.
You should have a throne.

436
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:35,683
Of all these bounds, even
from this line to this,

437
00:38:35,821 --> 00:38:36,753
we are now Lady.

438
00:38:37,823 --> 00:38:41,452
What says our youngest daughter,
our most dear Cordelia?

439
00:38:44,563 --> 00:38:45,894
Nothing, my lord.

440
00:38:46,932 --> 00:38:47,694
Nothing?

441
00:38:48,601 --> 00:38:49,363
Nothing.

442
00:38:51,604 --> 00:38:54,072
Nothing will come of nothing.
Speak again.

443
00:38:56,842 --> 00:38:59,777
Unhappy that I am, I cannot. ..

444
00:39:01,313 --> 00:39:02,302
leave?

445
00:39:03,549 --> 00:39:04,345
have?

446
00:39:04,483 --> 00:39:05,541
It's heave.

447
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:06,852
heave. ..

448
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:11,857
Sorry !

449
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:16,089
Okay. Unhappy that I am,
I cannot heave...

450
00:39:16,829 --> 00:39:18,694
my heart into my mouth.

451
00:39:20,032 --> 00:39:23,433
I love Your majesty
according to my bond.

452
00:39:23,636 --> 00:39:25,365
No more, no less.

453
00:39:31,343 --> 00:39:32,173
I II get him
something to drink.

454
00:39:33,245 --> 00:39:35,975
He must have eaten
one of the bad cans.

455
00:39:36,115 --> 00:39:37,446
Get him out of the sun!

456
00:39:38,984 --> 00:39:39,973
Here!

457
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:43,554
I need a drink. Now!
Please!

458
00:39:43,689 --> 00:39:46,249
Paul? Have you got
any more brandy?

459
00:39:46,492 --> 00:39:47,720
Get him out of the sun!

460
00:39:47,927 --> 00:39:50,088
Don't just stand there giving
out orders. Come and help!

461
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:55,967
We've got to get him
to a doctor.

462
00:39:58,304 --> 00:39:59,965
We've got to get him
to a doctor.

463
00:40:00,205 --> 00:40:01,604
We have to do something
you know what I mean?

464
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:04,732
We can't just sit here and
eat these fucking carrots!

465
00:40:04,877 --> 00:40:07,243
I mean, look at me! Look at me!
I need a wash, you know!

466
00:40:07,379 --> 00:40:10,473
I stink like a pig!
I really need a bath!

467
00:40:10,683 --> 00:40:11,615
What do you want?

468
00:40:11,817 --> 00:40:12,476
Get a grip!

469
00:40:12,785 --> 00:40:15,777
We're all going to fucking die!
Are you insane?

470
00:40:17,423 --> 00:40:18,981
Where the fuck is Jack?

471
00:40:19,124 --> 00:40:21,024
We can't just sit here
and do nothing!

472
00:40:21,226 --> 00:40:24,195
He should not have been away
this long!

473
00:40:24,330 --> 00:40:26,093
He should've been back sooner!

474
00:40:26,231 --> 00:40:28,791
We've got to do something!
We can't just sit around here...

475
00:40:28,934 --> 00:40:30,231
waiting for us all
to end up like that!

476
00:40:30,369 --> 00:40:30,926
What?

477
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:32,867
I don't fucking know!

478
00:40:33,505 --> 00:40:35,029
What do you want to do?

479
00:40:35,541 --> 00:40:36,439
Walking?

480
00:40:37,209 --> 00:40:38,301
You want to walk?

481
00:40:38,877 --> 00:40:41,778
Yeah, why not?
Jack walked that way,

482
00:40:42,181 --> 00:40:44,809
maybe we should try the other
way. Maybe we're lucky!

483
00:41:38,303 --> 00:41:41,761
I guess it's going to take a while
before we learn this stuff.

484
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:47,806
I know I'm not.. .
I'm not very good at it.

485
00:41:48,313 --> 00:41:49,439
Oh, I don't know.

486
00:41:51,383 --> 00:41:53,408
I'm not sure
if it's going to work out.

487
00:41:53,852 --> 00:41:54,876
Why?

488
00:41:56,388 --> 00:42:01,223
Poor old Lear has got the DT's,
we haven't got a Gloucester.

489
00:42:05,431 --> 00:42:06,830
What about Charles?

490
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:11,358
I don't think
Gloucester s much of a golfer.

491
00:42:13,739 --> 00:42:15,832
He probably doesn't want
to do it anyway !

492
00:42:17,676 --> 00:42:19,439
Not sure if any of them do.

493
00:42:25,784 --> 00:42:28,844
I think you're wrong about
people not wanting to do it.

494
00:42:31,623 --> 00:42:33,090
I know, I just. ..

495
00:42:35,127 --> 00:42:38,392
I can't go back to just sitting
around and thinking all day.

496
00:42:39,865 --> 00:42:44,359
All the thoughts that come
into my brain.

497
00:42:51,210 --> 00:42:52,802
What kind of thoughts?

498
00:42:55,981 --> 00:42:57,414
You know the kind.

499
00:43:00,152 --> 00:43:03,087
Is anyone back home
thinking about me?

500
00:43:05,457 --> 00:43:07,254
How's my sister?

501
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:11,661
Is she really
taking care of Flower Boy?

502
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:17,498
Flower Boy's my dog.

503
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:24,568
I mean they probably think
we're dead right?

504
00:43:28,514 --> 00:43:30,607
Do you think we're
going to die out here?

505
00:43:31,016 --> 00:43:32,005
No, no.

506
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:36,451
How do you know?

507
00:43:38,757 --> 00:43:40,725
I just know.

508
00:43:49,735 --> 00:43:52,363
I would really really
like to do the play.

509
00:44:03,315 --> 00:44:05,374
Do you think
you can learn the lines?

510
00:44:10,289 --> 00:44:13,315
Yes, I promise I can. I can.

511
00:44:17,863 --> 00:44:19,922
Were you really an actor?

512
00:44:21,567 --> 00:44:26,027
A long time ago
when I lived in London.

513
00:44:26,271 --> 00:44:27,966
Where do you live now?

514
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:29,298
Los Angeles.

515
00:44:29,441 --> 00:44:31,932
Wow! Are you in the movies?

516
00:44:33,045 --> 00:44:36,947
Well, no, not really.
I used to work in the theatre.

517
00:44:37,149 --> 00:44:40,380
Hmmm. I used to work
in the theatre too.

518
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:44,211
Where?

519
00:44:45,190 --> 00:44:46,020
Oh.

520
00:44:47,993 --> 00:44:49,688
No, no, no, no.

521
00:44:50,862 --> 00:44:53,387
You're going to have to use
your imagination on that one.

522
00:45:01,473 --> 00:45:02,531
Careful now.

523
00:45:02,941 --> 00:45:06,604
No, you're not like that.

524
00:45:35,274 --> 00:45:36,434
Cornflakes...

525
00:45:37,209 --> 00:45:40,042
or is it yogurt with muesli
you eat now?

526
00:45:40,812 --> 00:45:43,872
Do you remember that time we had
to buy a present for your mother,

527
00:45:44,883 --> 00:45:47,875
you got lost in the crowd,
I couldn't find you?

528
00:45:48,553 --> 00:45:51,989
These past days I've been
thinking of you more and more.

529
00:45:52,824 --> 00:45:54,724
I should have done that
a long time ago.

530
00:45:55,327 --> 00:46:01,197
Thoughts out here
the mistakes.

531
00:46:04,202 --> 00:46:06,397
I'm trying to
imagine your life.

532
00:46:18,617 --> 00:46:19,811
What are you doing here?

533
00:46:44,643 --> 00:46:46,235
Your plan failed.

534
00:46:47,913 --> 00:46:49,540
You haven't got a King.

535
00:46:50,649 --> 00:46:52,139
Oh, we'll work something out.

536
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:56,051
Might even do it myself.

537
00:46:57,756 --> 00:46:58,950
What about Cordelia?

538
00:47:01,059 --> 00:47:03,118
You would be
a wonderful Cordelia!

539
00:47:04,763 --> 00:47:06,321
You'd enjoy that, would you?

540
00:47:07,532 --> 00:47:09,500
You'd be better
than the one you've got now.

541
00:47:09,634 --> 00:47:11,033
Oh, I don't agree.

542
00:47:12,170 --> 00:47:14,536
I think she II be very good.

543
00:47:31,490 --> 00:47:32,115
Hello?

544
00:47:37,629 --> 00:47:38,857
Are you bored?

545
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:42,732
Yeah.

546
00:47:45,337 --> 00:47:46,827
I always am.

547
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:49,971
Even at home.

548
00:47:51,143 --> 00:47:52,838
It's not any easier out here.

549
00:47:53,011 --> 00:47:53,705
No.

550
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:56,572
Quite.

551
00:47:59,751 --> 00:48:00,843
How do you do it?

552
00:48:01,553 --> 00:48:03,077
How do you pass the time?

553
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:08,218
By keeping a very firm grip
on myself that's how I do it.

554
00:48:11,863 --> 00:48:13,922
You don't want to take part
in the play, huh?

555
00:48:14,633 --> 00:48:16,032
That's well observed.

556
00:48:17,302 --> 00:48:21,170
I just don't understand this urge...
that people have to parade themselves.

557
00:48:22,641 --> 00:48:30,571
Pretending like those Japs who think
they're Sinatra or Elvis Presley.

558
00:48:31,516 --> 00:48:33,313
Women who can't wait
to get on TV. ..

559
00:48:33,452 --> 00:48:36,512
to tell the world they're shagging
their husband's best friend.

560
00:48:37,355 --> 00:48:39,448
It's what makes you happy right?

561
00:48:40,525 --> 00:48:41,514
Happy?

562
00:48:43,028 --> 00:48:45,155
Yeah, happy.

563
00:48:45,530 --> 00:48:47,521
Look, the only reason you're
running about out there is. ..

564
00:48:47,666 --> 00:48:49,634
because you can't think of
anything better to do!

565
00:48:49,835 --> 00:48:51,860
Where's the dignity in that?

566
00:48:52,737 --> 00:48:55,331
Don't you think you can
suck me into this farce!

567
00:48:56,074 --> 00:48:58,042
No, nobody thinks they can.

568
00:49:03,081 --> 00:49:04,412
Do you think I'm blind?

569
00:49:06,751 --> 00:49:08,218
Or do you think I'm stupid?

570
00:49:08,353 --> 00:49:09,320
No.

571
00:49:09,888 --> 00:49:13,016
I've seen you
with those chaps out there.

572
00:49:16,661 --> 00:49:18,629
Don't think you can flash
your pretty little eyes at me.. .

573
00:49:18,763 --> 00:49:20,390
and make me go all gooey.

574
00:49:25,737 --> 00:49:27,329
Still, never say never.

575
00:49:31,176 --> 00:49:33,041
Let's negotiate.
Let's do a deal.

576
00:49:34,179 --> 00:49:35,111
Okay.

577
00:49:42,888 --> 00:49:44,879
But it's payment on delivery.

578
00:49:45,023 --> 00:49:46,547
Yeah? What?

579
00:49:47,125 --> 00:49:49,616
If I m going to do join in
there's got to be one condition.

580
00:49:51,396 --> 00:49:52,829
I get to fuck you.

581
00:50:03,742 --> 00:50:05,676
Fuck you til this madness ends.

582
00:50:16,121 --> 00:50:17,554
Isn't that what you're
supposed to do? I mean,

583
00:50:17,689 --> 00:50:19,850
sacrifice yourself for your art?

584
00:50:25,997 --> 00:50:28,989
I must love you, I
would fain know you better.

585
00:50:29,167 --> 00:50:31,192
Sir, I shall study deserving.

586
00:50:32,771 --> 00:50:34,238
The King is coming.

587
00:50:38,910 --> 00:50:39,899
Alright, very good.

588
00:50:40,045 --> 00:50:43,947
Let's skip my lines
and go straight to Goneril.

589
00:50:45,150 --> 00:50:46,117
Liz.

590
00:50:56,561 --> 00:50:59,724
I love you more than
words can wield the matter.

591
00:50:59,864 --> 00:51:02,162
Beyond what is regarded
rich and rare.

592
00:51:03,034 --> 00:51:06,162
No less than life, with grace,
and health, and honor.

593
00:51:06,338 --> 00:51:08,932
I am opposed to any other joy. ..

594
00:51:09,074 --> 00:51:13,010
that the most precious square
of sense possesses and find.

595
00:51:13,278 --> 00:51:18,978
I am alone.. .felicitate
in your love.

596
00:51:27,292 --> 00:51:29,260
Isn't it your turn, Henry?

597
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:35,691
Well, yes. ..right. Let's. ..

598
00:51:37,402 --> 00:51:38,960
Let s try something else.

599
00:51:41,172 --> 00:51:43,970
Henry, I think I'm just
a little bit confused...

600
00:51:45,477 --> 00:51:49,538
like, I need to know like who
she is and where she comes from.

601
00:51:59,124 --> 00:52:01,024
Let it be so.

602
00:52:01,226 --> 00:52:04,684
Thy truth then be thy dower.

603
00:52:05,397 --> 00:52:08,764
For, by the sacred radiance
of the sun.

604
00:52:08,967 --> 00:52:12,368
By the mysteries of Hecate
and the night.

605
00:52:13,204 --> 00:52:15,934
By all the operation
of the orbs.

606
00:52:16,074 --> 00:52:19,043
By whom we do exist.
And cease to be.

607
00:52:19,477 --> 00:52:23,072
Here I disclaim
all my paternal care.

608
00:52:23,481 --> 00:52:27,577
Proximity and property of blood...

609
00:52:27,952 --> 00:52:32,719
and as a stranger to my heart
and me. Hold thee from this. ..

610
00:52:35,593 --> 00:52:36,617
forever.

611
00:52:40,265 --> 00:52:43,701
The barbarous cronos...

612
00:52:43,868 --> 00:52:48,066
who makes his generation
dishes to gorge his appetite. ..

613
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:54,137
shall to my bosom
be a friend, neighbor,

614
00:52:54,846 --> 00:52:58,282
and relative as thou.

615
00:52:59,050 --> 00:53:01,041
My sometime. ..

616
00:53:02,987 --> 00:53:04,454
daughter.

617
00:53:10,128 --> 00:53:14,758
And Kent, come not
between the dragon and his wrath.

618
00:53:14,899 --> 00:53:18,699
I loved her most.. .

619
00:53:20,038 --> 00:53:24,065
and thought to set my rest
on her kind nursery.

620
00:53:25,243 --> 00:53:27,211
Hence and avoid my sight.

621
00:53:30,882 --> 00:53:34,511
So shall my grave be my peace.

622
00:53:35,453 --> 00:53:36,715
It s here.

623
00:53:38,523 --> 00:53:44,553
I take her father s heart
from her.

624
00:54:07,318 --> 00:54:08,979
Yes, well I think
that went very well.

625
00:54:15,994 --> 00:54:16,790
Is that it?

626
00:54:55,633 --> 00:54:58,193
Maybe he's a king and
maybe she's a princess. ..but...

627
00:54:58,336 --> 00:55:02,864
whoever heard of
a daughter that. ..

628
00:55:03,007 --> 00:55:04,770
loved her father and wouldn't
tell him that she loved him.

629
00:55:04,909 --> 00:55:07,002
I mean that doesn't make
any sense.

630
00:55:07,278 --> 00:55:09,371
Least he had a daughter.

631
00:55:19,924 --> 00:55:23,189
What s the point of having a child
if you don't have a life?

632
00:55:35,139 --> 00:55:36,572
God, those eyes.

633
00:56:36,467 --> 00:56:37,627
Oh Gina,

634
00:56:38,069 --> 00:56:41,163
Gina, Gina.

635
00:56:45,176 --> 00:56:49,237
It's like a volcano
going off in my head.

636
00:56:55,420 --> 00:56:57,183
I mean. ..l'm sure you ve
heard this a million times but.. .

637
00:56:57,889 --> 00:56:59,584
I've never felt.. .

638
00:57:00,458 --> 00:57:03,450
I ve never seen such passion.

639
00:57:04,762 --> 00:57:08,721
I just have to touch you
and...whoosh!

640
00:57:10,034 --> 00:57:12,502
But I'm in pretty good shape,
don't you think?

641
00:57:15,807 --> 00:57:18,207
You felt it didn't you
Gina?

642
00:57:23,047 --> 00:57:24,344
Was it good for you?

643
00:57:26,250 --> 00:57:28,115
Yes, yes it was good.

644
00:57:32,523 --> 00:57:33,785
I'm flattered.

645
00:57:34,692 --> 00:57:35,954
I m proud.

646
00:57:37,662 --> 00:57:39,527
Have you been with many women?

647
00:57:40,131 --> 00:57:41,098
Oh, Yes.

648
00:57:42,367 --> 00:57:43,561
Well, you know,

649
00:57:45,036 --> 00:57:46,594
women and women.

650
00:57:48,072 --> 00:57:50,336
But I've never felt like this.

651
00:57:51,109 --> 00:57:53,168
I always knew there was someone...

652
00:57:53,678 --> 00:57:55,202
I always knew
the moment would come.

653
00:57:55,413 --> 00:57:57,608
See, that's why
I kept myself fit.

654
00:57:57,949 --> 00:58:00,281
You know, exercising every
morning before I went to work. ..

655
00:58:00,418 --> 00:58:03,546
and when I came home
I was exercising, then...

656
00:58:03,688 --> 00:58:05,918
it's golf for the weekend
and that sort of thing.

657
00:58:09,093 --> 00:58:11,926
But I always had a target.

658
00:58:15,266 --> 00:58:17,757
I always had a reason
to keep myself fit.

659
00:58:18,936 --> 00:58:20,198
So I was ready!

660
00:58:24,509 --> 00:58:26,101
I don't just mean for fucking.

661
00:58:31,082 --> 00:58:32,174
Love.

662
00:58:36,654 --> 00:58:37,848
I'm in love!

663
00:58:44,162 --> 00:58:46,392
I've always
been ready for love!

664
00:58:50,368 --> 00:58:55,738
Had you not been there father,
these white hairs...

665
00:58:57,975 --> 00:59:03,811
Had you not been there father,
these white hairs...

666
00:59:05,249 --> 00:59:06,341
Is this a face. ..

667
00:59:11,522 --> 00:59:12,580
Is this a face?

668
00:59:14,725 --> 00:59:16,215
Is this a face?

669
00:59:17,328 --> 00:59:18,761
This is a face.

670
00:59:19,664 --> 00:59:20,961
Is this a face?

671
00:59:22,667 --> 00:59:25,158
This is a f ace to.. .

672
00:59:38,616 --> 00:59:40,174
'Tis known to us.

673
00:59:42,453 --> 00:59:45,718
Our preparation stands
in expectation of them.

674
00:59:46,257 --> 00:59:49,226
O dear father, ...

675
00:59:50,895 --> 00:59:53,864
'Tis thy own welf are
that I care about.

676
00:59:54,932 --> 00:59:58,663
For this, great France.

677
00:59:59,704 --> 01:00:03,003
My sad and mourning tears
hath pitied.

678
01:00:36,107 --> 01:00:38,905
Ask thy daughter s blessing.

679
01:00:39,577 --> 01:00:41,272
This is a night.. .

680
01:00:41,779 --> 01:00:45,909
pities neither wise men
nor fools.

681
01:00:46,050 --> 01:00:47,312
I can't hear you.

682
01:00:53,858 --> 01:00:54,984
O nuncle,

683
01:00:56,160 --> 01:00:58,526
court holy-water in a dry house.

684
01:00:59,030 --> 01:01:00,930
He makes me want to puke.

685
01:01:01,165 --> 01:01:02,462
What s the matter now?

686
01:01:04,235 --> 01:01:06,567
Messing about with a tart
like that at his age.

687
01:01:10,308 --> 01:01:12,640
What about this one?
Is this one too dented?

688
01:01:13,611 --> 01:01:15,772
Oh, chuck it away,
don't take a chance.

689
01:01:23,020 --> 01:01:24,487
They re all dented.

690
01:01:25,790 --> 01:01:27,189
No, no,

691
01:01:27,625 --> 01:01:29,286
no, no.

692
01:01:29,427 --> 01:01:31,019
Amanda, you should have checked
these boxes earlier!

693
01:01:31,162 --> 01:01:32,595
What the fuck are we going
to live on?

694
01:01:40,137 --> 01:01:41,126
There's a plane!

695
01:01:41,872 --> 01:01:43,703
There's a plane
for God's sake!

696
01:01:50,915 --> 01:01:52,109
You're not pointing it right.
Give me the mirror.

697
01:01:52,717 --> 01:01:53,240
Give me the mirror !

698
01:01:53,384 --> 01:01:54,476
Paul, let him do it, Paul!

699
01:01:54,619 --> 01:01:56,109
You're not doing it right way!

700
01:01:56,787 --> 01:01:57,583
Give me the mirror !

701
01:01:57,722 --> 01:01:59,485
You're not doing it right!
Give me the mirror !

702
01:02:06,430 --> 01:02:10,696
They ate a bit less every day...

703
01:02:11,002 --> 01:02:15,166
then they said words
the rest of the time.

704
01:02:15,673 --> 01:02:23,910
I don't know if the desert crept
into their heads at night...

705
01:02:24,181 --> 01:02:28,550
but in the day it wasn't there.

706
01:02:30,421 --> 01:02:33,754
Together they said words.

707
01:02:33,891 --> 01:02:37,156
They still didn't say them
to each other.

708
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:43,890
This is nothing fool!

709
01:02:46,704 --> 01:02:48,672
We're not quite there yet Ray.

710
01:02:50,341 --> 01:02:52,605
The trouble is you're doing it
from the throat,

711
01:02:52,810 --> 01:02:56,644
try taking a deep breath
and then say the line.

712
01:02:58,349 --> 01:02:59,782
This is nothing fool!

713
01:03:01,218 --> 01:03:03,049
Not quite, do it again.

714
01:03:05,089 --> 01:03:08,581
Henry, I really don't think I'm
cut out for this stuff, you know?

715
01:03:09,060 --> 01:03:10,823
No, you'll be fine,
you II be fine,

716
01:03:10,961 --> 01:03:14,192
now just concentrate
on the words.

717
01:03:14,732 --> 01:03:15,994
And forget about the rest of us.

718
01:03:16,600 --> 01:03:20,502
And just take your time.
We've got plenty of time.

719
01:03:22,873 --> 01:03:23,840
All right?

720
01:03:28,012 --> 01:03:28,706
Amanda.

721
01:03:31,649 --> 01:03:33,514
Would you do something for me?
Take this.

722
01:03:35,786 --> 01:03:38,482
Now would you go into
that house over there.

723
01:03:39,357 --> 01:03:43,691
What I need is to hear you
not the fool.. . you.

724
01:03:43,961 --> 01:03:47,624
Just think about
what the fool has to say...

725
01:03:47,765 --> 01:03:51,667
and find your own meaning in it.
All right?

726
01:03:54,171 --> 01:03:55,069
Okay.

727
01:04:32,376 --> 01:04:34,241
Oh my God, what is this place?

728
01:04:34,378 --> 01:04:35,936
It's an ice house.

729
01:04:36,781 --> 01:04:38,715
Well, that's just typical,
isn't it?

730
01:04:40,484 --> 01:04:44,147
Lots of big beefy guys
all working really hard.

731
01:04:51,362 --> 01:04:53,796
Just to keep their women cold.

732
01:05:12,516 --> 01:05:14,484
You know why I brought you here?

733
01:05:14,785 --> 01:05:15,717
Yes.

734
01:05:16,754 --> 01:05:18,153
No, you don't.

735
01:05:19,990 --> 01:05:22,049
I brought you here
to piss my husband off.

736
01:05:23,060 --> 01:05:25,051
I wanted to kick him
in the balls.

737
01:05:28,699 --> 01:05:30,826
None of the old guys would work. ..

738
01:05:31,335 --> 01:05:33,633
and Ray would never
believe that

739
01:05:35,706 --> 01:05:38,300
I'd do the stupid guy
but you're just perfect.

740
01:05:40,411 --> 01:05:43,346
White men don't like
their wives fucking black men!

741
01:05:54,391 --> 01:05:55,323
Think I'm a bitch?

742
01:05:59,897 --> 01:06:02,229
I guess I am a real bitch.

743
01:06:03,667 --> 01:06:04,861
Come on.

744
01:06:05,669 --> 01:06:08,229
You might as well take your reward
cause I ve got mine already.

745
01:06:08,873 --> 01:06:10,807
And nobody s going to believe
a fucking word you say anyway!

746
01:06:11,442 --> 01:06:12,306
C mon.

747
01:06:21,952 --> 01:06:22,884
Turn around.

748
01:06:23,354 --> 01:06:24,582
Turn around.

749
01:06:30,127 --> 01:06:31,492
Get down on your knees.

750
01:06:33,864 --> 01:06:35,331
Get down on your knees.

751
01:07:09,300 --> 01:07:11,291
So this is the way you want it?

752
01:07:12,736 --> 01:07:14,533
On demand?

753
01:07:46,370 --> 01:07:48,031
You fucking bastard!

754
01:08:09,893 --> 01:08:11,417
You don't understand, do you?

755
01:08:20,571 --> 01:08:21,697
Come on.

756
01:08:38,389 --> 01:08:39,048
Where's Ray?

757
01:08:41,191 --> 01:08:43,489
I don't know, where's Amanda?

758
01:08:44,194 --> 01:08:45,388
She II be here in a minute.

759
01:08:49,667 --> 01:08:50,656
Goodnight.

760
01:08:51,702 --> 01:08:52,566
Night.

761
01:09:03,814 --> 01:09:04,838
I think I'll also turn in.

762
01:09:05,049 --> 01:09:05,845
No, sit down.

763
01:09:06,450 --> 01:09:08,315
- No, I d rather. ..
- No, no.

764
01:09:10,521 --> 01:09:12,421
You can sit down
and talk to me for a minute.

765
01:09:19,730 --> 01:09:21,027
You like women?

766
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:23,630
Yeah.

767
01:09:28,305 --> 01:09:29,033
Yeah.

768
01:09:31,575 --> 01:09:34,009
Where would we be
without women, hey?

769
01:09:35,479 --> 01:09:37,743
Our lives would be miserable.

770
01:09:40,718 --> 01:09:42,242
I think I'd just fall apart.

771
01:09:45,089 --> 01:09:46,750
I d be down at the pub
all night,

772
01:09:49,026 --> 01:09:50,926
day in, day out,

773
01:09:52,796 --> 01:09:54,593
looking for the one and only.

774
01:10:02,072 --> 01:10:03,539
Have you got a wife?

775
01:10:04,007 --> 01:10:04,905
Yes.

776
01:10:09,446 --> 01:10:11,346
Why are you fucking Liz?

777
01:10:14,084 --> 01:10:14,743
I'm not...

778
01:10:14,885 --> 01:10:15,909
Shut up!

779
01:10:18,055 --> 01:10:21,650
You're sticking your stinking prick
into other people's relationships.

780
01:10:21,925 --> 01:10:22,755
I'm not...

781
01:10:22,860 --> 01:10:23,792
I said, shut up!

782
01:10:26,330 --> 01:10:27,262
Asshole!

783
01:10:32,569 --> 01:10:33,399
Sit...

784
01:10:34,671 --> 01:10:35,399
down!

785
01:10:42,479 --> 01:10:43,946
What has Ray ever done to you?

786
01:10:50,654 --> 01:10:53,282
If you want to fuck our women,

787
01:10:54,358 --> 01:10:56,656
then you've got to fucking fight!

788
01:10:57,094 --> 01:10:58,721
C mon, get up! Fight!

789
01:10:58,862 --> 01:11:00,227
Paul! Let him go!

790
01:11:00,397 --> 01:11:00,954
C mon.

791
01:11:02,766 --> 01:11:04,233
C mon, hit me you poof.

792
01:11:04,368 --> 01:11:07,337
Let him go. Let him go!
Paul!

793
01:11:08,272 --> 01:11:09,364
Paul, get off him!

794
01:11:10,707 --> 01:11:12,675
Paul, get off him!

795
01:11:12,810 --> 01:11:15,802
No! Are you out of
your stupid head?

796
01:11:19,850 --> 01:11:20,839
Are you okay?

797
01:11:23,053 --> 01:11:24,042
Amanda.

798
01:11:26,824 --> 01:11:27,654
Leave us alone!

799
01:11:35,866 --> 01:11:36,890
Amanda!

800
01:11:41,271 --> 01:11:42,966
Amanda!

801
01:12:21,545 --> 01:12:22,739
Shame on you.

802
01:12:32,823 --> 01:12:35,815
You can't just leap about
bashing people senseless.

803
01:12:37,861 --> 01:12:39,294
He was asking for it.

804
01:12:41,331 --> 01:12:42,491
No, he wasn't.

805
01:12:43,066 --> 01:12:44,124
He was.

806
01:12:44,468 --> 01:12:45,400
No. He wasn't.

807
01:12:45,535 --> 01:12:48,868
He was. Amanda,
he was asking for it!

808
01:13:02,219 --> 01:13:04,210
I don't know you anymore.

809
01:13:06,256 --> 01:13:07,723
We don't know each other.

810
01:13:21,705 --> 01:13:23,400
I've always done everything
for you.

811
01:13:23,540 --> 01:13:24,199
No.

812
01:13:24,341 --> 01:13:26,036
You know that! Everything!

813
01:13:26,176 --> 01:13:27,871
Everything you've done
you've done for yourself.

814
01:13:28,011 --> 01:13:30,275
You've never considered me
not for a second.

815
01:13:38,288 --> 01:13:40,882
You don't always get
what you dream of having.

816
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:45,520
I always knew
that you were nothing special.

817
01:13:49,866 --> 01:13:56,567
But that was okay because
I just wanted a peaceful life.

818
01:14:01,611 --> 01:14:03,977
But the worst thing is,
you yourself.

819
01:14:08,518 --> 01:14:10,952
The ridiculous,

820
01:14:12,656 --> 01:14:16,092
pathetic way your head works.

821
01:14:17,394 --> 01:14:18,156
I never...

822
01:14:21,298 --> 01:14:23,289
I never knew you were a pig!

823
01:14:24,668 --> 01:14:25,498
Stop what you're saying now...

824
01:14:25,635 --> 01:14:26,624
because you don't mean
what you're saying.

825
01:14:26,903 --> 01:14:28,131
Yes, I do.

826
01:14:33,043 --> 01:14:35,136
I do mean what I'm saying.

827
01:14:38,715 --> 01:14:40,444
For once in my life
I m absolutely clear headed...

828
01:14:40,684 --> 01:14:42,174
about what I'm saying.

829
01:14:55,032 --> 01:14:58,468
No, Amanda, don't go,
Amanda, stay.

830
01:15:04,074 --> 01:15:05,701
You can't do this.

831
01:15:16,119 --> 01:15:17,552
Yes, I can.

832
01:15:20,390 --> 01:15:21,516
I II change. I'll change.

833
01:15:22,259 --> 01:15:24,022
I'll change!
I promise I'll change.

834
01:15:24,327 --> 01:15:26,591
I'll change. I'll change!

835
01:15:27,497 --> 01:15:29,556
Don't go!

836
01:15:44,247 --> 01:15:45,407
O nuncle,

837
01:15:47,317 --> 01:15:48,909
court holy- water...

838
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:53,788
in a dry house is better than
this rain water out of doors.

839
01:15:56,059 --> 01:16:00,519
Good nuncle, in?
Ask thy daughter's blessing.

840
01:16:01,465 --> 01:16:02,955
Here's a night...

841
01:16:03,867 --> 01:16:07,268
pities neither wise men
nor fools.

842
01:16:08,872 --> 01:16:10,032
Are you alright?

843
01:16:54,217 --> 01:16:56,515
Time had passed.

844
01:16:56,987 --> 01:16:59,319
The time it takes.

845
01:16:59,456 --> 01:17:02,653
For a while
I didn't see the big man.

846
01:17:04,094 --> 01:17:08,087
I didn't understand
a word they said.

847
01:17:10,367 --> 01:17:13,859
Nor did they.

848
01:17:16,106 --> 01:17:20,600
I think that Henry understood
what they said.

849
01:17:28,285 --> 01:17:28,876
Okay.

850
01:17:30,020 --> 01:17:33,979
I must change arms at home,
and give the distaff.

851
01:17:34,124 --> 01:17:36,217
Into my husband's hands.

852
01:17:37,160 --> 01:17:38,320
Soon you will hear.

853
01:17:38,461 --> 01:17:42,488
If you dare venture on your own
behalf a mistress' bidding.

854
01:17:42,832 --> 01:17:44,322
Decline your head.

855
01:17:51,274 --> 01:17:54,607
This kiss, if it durst speak.. .

856
01:17:59,249 --> 01:18:00,841
I can do it better,
I can do it better.

857
01:18:01,651 --> 01:18:03,118
Can I do it again?

858
01:18:03,420 --> 01:18:04,512
Yeah, sure. ..

859
01:18:06,256 --> 01:18:07,883
I must give this.

860
01:18:09,492 --> 01:18:11,983
I must change arms at home,

861
01:18:13,597 --> 01:18:17,590
and give the distaff.
Into my husband's hands.

862
01:18:18,969 --> 01:18:20,732
Soon you will hear.

863
01:18:21,137 --> 01:18:27,599
If you dare venture on your own behalf
to do a mistress' bidding.

864
01:18:28,712 --> 01:18:29,872
Wear this.

865
01:18:33,250 --> 01:18:34,774
Decline your head,

866
01:18:36,486 --> 01:18:40,081
this kiss, if it durst speak.. .

867
01:18:59,409 --> 01:19:01,206
Can I try this one more time?

868
01:19:01,411 --> 01:19:02,435
Please?

869
01:19:02,579 --> 01:19:04,740
Well, actually, it's fine
but if you like.. .

870
01:19:04,881 --> 01:19:06,576
Please. Please.

871
01:19:15,992 --> 01:19:18,290
I must change arms at home,

872
01:19:19,129 --> 01:19:22,496
and give the distaff.
Into my husband's hands.

873
01:19:22,632 --> 01:19:24,293
Soon you will hear.

874
01:19:25,669 --> 01:19:28,399
If you dare venture
on your own behalf.

875
01:19:29,939 --> 01:19:31,736
A mistress's bidding.

876
01:19:37,781 --> 01:19:38,873
Wear this.

877
01:19:40,517 --> 01:19:42,075
Spare speech.

878
01:19:43,987 --> 01:19:45,249
This kiss,

879
01:19:49,392 --> 01:19:53,294
conceive and fare thee well.

880
01:20:08,812 --> 01:20:09,676
Ray!

881
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:11,240
He'll be back.

882
01:20:14,250 --> 01:20:15,114
Ray.

883
01:20:16,252 --> 01:20:17,082
Ray.

884
01:21:29,159 --> 01:21:29,853
Jesus.

885
01:21:59,222 --> 01:22:00,519
What s the matter?
What s the matter?

886
01:22:03,159 --> 01:22:04,091
I can't breathe.

887
01:22:04,294 --> 01:22:05,386
She's got a fever.

888
01:22:05,862 --> 01:22:08,296
She's got a fever.
Help me, help me get her inside.

889
01:22:08,531 --> 01:22:09,463
C'mon, please.

890
01:22:22,412 --> 01:22:23,174
How are you darling?

891
01:22:25,381 --> 01:22:27,212
Would you prefer to be
by yourself?

892
01:22:28,651 --> 01:22:29,515
Yes.

893
01:22:29,786 --> 01:22:31,481
Okay, okay.

894
01:22:46,936 --> 01:22:52,169
I don't want anything from you,
don't you get it?

895
01:23:04,454 --> 01:23:06,115
You're an old letch.

896
01:23:11,494 --> 01:23:16,522
When you touched me
you made me wanna puke.

897
01:23:22,872 --> 01:23:25,534
Your grinning and
sweating all over me.

898
01:23:25,675 --> 01:23:26,664
Please.

899
01:23:27,210 --> 01:23:28,074
Oh.

900
01:23:29,679 --> 01:23:33,740
I thought I was going to
crawl out of my skin.

901
01:23:36,586 --> 01:23:38,554
But you really fell
for it huh?

902
01:23:40,857 --> 01:23:42,381
Yeah, you fell for it.

903
01:23:48,231 --> 01:23:50,495
You're a mean fucking
sonofabitch.

904
01:23:51,167 --> 01:23:52,464
You're smug,

905
01:23:53,770 --> 01:23:55,362
you're not funny,

906
01:23:56,539 --> 01:23:58,404
you're not nice to people.

907
01:23:59,742 --> 01:24:01,175
You look like fucking shit.

908
01:24:05,014 --> 01:24:06,914
Why would I want to go with you?

909
01:24:09,652 --> 01:24:11,313
Do you wanna know why?

910
01:24:17,694 --> 01:24:21,460
You know that smile you have
that's so fucking condescending?

911
01:24:22,732 --> 01:24:24,427
The way you look at people.

912
01:24:24,901 --> 01:24:26,926
The way you judge everybody.

913
01:24:29,138 --> 01:24:31,470
I just...I wanna...

914
01:24:33,843 --> 01:24:36,004
I just wanted to open you up.

915
01:25:02,171 --> 01:25:03,399
Get the fuck out of here.

916
01:25:07,644 --> 01:25:09,271
Get the fuck out of here.

917
01:25:12,749 --> 01:25:13,773
GO!

918
01:25:42,145 --> 01:25:45,205
. ..good Lord, sit here
and rest a while.

919
01:25:46,849 --> 01:25:49,147
I have a journey, sir
shortly to go.

920
01:25:51,154 --> 01:25:55,318
My master calls me,
I must not say no.

921
01:25:56,959 --> 01:25:59,450
.. .hard by, there is a hovel.

922
01:26:03,533 --> 01:26:04,659
Repose...

923
01:26:05,234 --> 01:26:08,294
but there while I
to this hard house.

924
01:26:09,772 --> 01:26:14,436
My master calls me,
I must not say no.

925
01:26:20,316 --> 01:26:26,255
Return and force
this wanting courtesy.

926
01:27:05,361 --> 01:27:06,487
Where's Gina?

927
01:27:33,156 --> 01:27:33,884
Can we talk?

928
01:27:37,827 --> 01:27:39,522
Charles, we have to talk.

929
01:27:39,662 --> 01:27:40,686
I can't.

930
01:27:52,809 --> 01:27:54,299
You'd better get something
on your head.

931
01:28:22,104 --> 01:28:26,097
You can't stay out here.
You ve got to go inside.

932
01:28:27,310 --> 01:28:28,174
C mon.

933
01:28:32,648 --> 01:28:34,741
Shouldn't you be rehearsing?

934
01:28:36,919 --> 01:28:37,817
No.

935
01:28:41,390 --> 01:28:43,358
Not without Cordelia.

936
01:28:43,693 --> 01:28:45,058
Catherine.

937
01:28:50,266 --> 01:28:51,324
Gina?

938
01:29:10,453 --> 01:29:11,477
Look.

939
01:29:14,523 --> 01:29:15,512
Cans.

940
01:29:17,159 --> 01:29:18,126
Look.

941
01:29:48,190 --> 01:29:50,055
He's dead.

942
01:29:53,062 --> 01:29:54,654
He's lying out there.

943
01:30:00,603 --> 01:30:02,935
This little piggy
went to market.

944
01:30:05,174 --> 01:30:09,008
This little piggy
wouldn't talk to me.

945
01:30:11,614 --> 01:30:16,711
And this little piggy went
wee, wee, wee.

946
01:30:17,920 --> 01:30:19,683
All the way home.

947
01:30:23,025 --> 01:30:28,520
This little piggy thought
she was an actress.

948
01:30:30,299 --> 01:30:34,565
And this little piggy was...

949
01:30:36,105 --> 01:30:37,402
was a pig.

950
01:30:40,009 --> 01:30:40,668
OINK OINK!

951
01:30:40,810 --> 01:30:42,710
Shut up, Shut up!

952
01:30:46,716 --> 01:30:48,946
I want to know
what s left of him.

953
01:30:51,120 --> 01:30:55,056
Probably only the skeleton,
wrapped in his clothes.

954
01:30:58,928 --> 01:31:01,294
We have to go out there
and bury him.

955
01:36:51,580 --> 01:36:55,482
This cold night will turn us all
to fools and madmen.

956
01:37:01,757 --> 01:37:03,918
By the laws of war.. .

957
01:37:05,461 --> 01:37:09,397
thou needst not answer
An unknown adversary.

958
01:37:11,533 --> 01:37:14,024
Thou art not vanquished.

959
01:37:15,904 --> 01:37:18,964
But cozen'd and beguiled.

960
01:37:28,617 --> 01:37:33,452
As you have charged me,
I am guilty.

961
01:37:35,357 --> 01:37:37,188
And have done much more.

962
01:37:41,230 --> 01:37:43,425
Let's exchange charity.

963
01:37:47,469 --> 01:37:48,993
It is true.

964
01:37:49,671 --> 01:37:51,798
The wheel has come full circle

965
01:37:52,808 --> 01:37:55,675
Howl,

966
01:37:58,380 --> 01:38:01,941
howl,

967
01:38:05,954 --> 01:38:08,218
howl.

968
01:38:11,293 --> 01:38:14,456
O you are men of stones.

969
01:38:16,865 --> 01:38:19,231
Had I your tongues and eyes,

970
01:38:19,835 --> 01:38:25,205
I d use them so that heaven's
vault should crack?

971
01:38:27,743 --> 01:38:32,180
She's gone forever.

972
01:38:35,451 --> 01:38:38,249
I know when one is dead
and when one lives.

973
01:38:40,222 --> 01:38:41,985
She's dead as earth.

974
01:38:47,296 --> 01:38:49,526
Is this the promis'd end?

975
01:38:56,371 --> 01:39:00,705
From the desert came peace.

976
01:39:08,650 --> 01:39:11,346
They didn't see everything.

977
01:39:11,620 --> 01:39:14,418
I saw it all.

978
01:39:51,527 --> 01:39:52,960
A plague upon you,

979
01:39:53,695 --> 01:39:57,756
murderers, traitors, all!

980
01:39:58,200 --> 01:40:00,464
I might have saved her?

981
01:40:01,603 --> 01:40:03,264
Now she's gone.

982
01:40:04,940 --> 01:40:06,100
Forever.

983
01:40:09,545 --> 01:40:11,035
Cordelia?

984
01:40:14,283 --> 01:40:15,716
Cordelia?

985
01:40:17,986 --> 01:40:19,613
Stay a little.

986
01:41:18,380 --> 01:41:21,247
They are not here.

987
01:41:23,685 --> 01:41:26,245
Now they are gone.
