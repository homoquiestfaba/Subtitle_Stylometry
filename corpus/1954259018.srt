1
00:01:25,351 --> 00:01:27,980
- Is there any water?
- No.

2
00:01:30,523 --> 00:01:33,357
- You got any weed?
- No.

3
00:01:34,294 --> 00:01:36,525
We should try and score though.

4
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:40,892
I'm hungry.

5
00:01:46,339 --> 00:01:50,504
Well, let's hit the dumpsters
behind Flake.

6
00:01:53,746 --> 00:01:55,977
Mook, wake up, man.

7
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:05,352
Let's go.

8
00:02:33,453 --> 00:02:36,252
No! What the fuck?

9
00:02:39,726 --> 00:02:41,251
Wait. What are you--?

10
00:02:47,133 --> 00:02:50,433
- Hey, do you guys sell phone cards?
- We do.

11
00:02:55,241 --> 00:02:58,439
- One?
- Sorry, the international one.

12
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:05,384
Here you go.

13
00:03:06,286 --> 00:03:07,720
Hey, he's stealing!

14
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:10,252
- Hey!
- Hey, you little punk!

15
00:03:10,423 --> 00:03:11,823
Hey.

16
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:14,884
- Fuck you, man!
- You little fucker! You with him?

17
00:03:15,061 --> 00:03:16,085
- No.
- You are.

18
00:03:16,262 --> 00:03:18,026
- No!
- Come here, you bitch! Hey!

19
00:03:26,072 --> 00:03:27,631
All right, what do you say?

20
00:03:27,807 --> 00:03:30,936
B.V., you like those, I know.

21
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:33,909
Hey, can I have a cigarette?

22
00:03:35,815 --> 00:03:37,716
- Not healthy.
- Banana.

23
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:38,977
- Banana.
- Yeah.

24
00:03:41,154 --> 00:03:42,918
Eat up, eat up.

25
00:03:43,089 --> 00:03:44,421
All right.

26
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:46,992
Oh, hey, the drum circle's tonight,
remember?

27
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,856
- Fuck, yeah.
- It's gonna be dope.

28
00:03:49,028 --> 00:03:51,759
- Fuck, yeah.
- Al said he'll give us some acid.

29
00:03:51,931 --> 00:03:54,400
- How much?
- It's not about the money.

30
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:57,093
We work on a barter system.

31
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,732
Like jacking that chick's purse
yesterday?

32
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:02,307
- Bitch, you step off.
- Don't call me a bitch.

33
00:04:02,475 --> 00:04:03,943
- Chill.
- What's your problem?

34
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:08,047
- Don't say I'm gonna steal the purse.
- Everybody chill. Al owes me a favor.

35
00:04:08,214 --> 00:04:11,412
That's why he's hooking us the tabs,
okay? That's it.

36
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,778
I got you this.

37
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:17,782
That's sweet.

38
00:04:21,961 --> 00:04:23,224
Thank you.

39
00:04:23,396 --> 00:04:26,366
- It's just a fucking cake.
- I know.

40
00:06:28,187 --> 00:06:30,213
Where are you going?

41
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:38,020
One man's trash
is another man's treasure, my friend.

42
00:06:38,197 --> 00:06:41,998
Especially if that one man
is a rich prick.

43
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:25,032
I can't believe
we're leaving tonight at 9.

44
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:29,270
You don't have to clean
until the Saturday before we get back.

45
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:31,172
- But that's four weeks.
- Exactly.

46
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:33,575
It's okay.
Terrence and me watch the house.

47
00:08:33,746 --> 00:08:35,112
I know you will.

48
00:08:35,281 --> 00:08:37,614
Remember to set the alarm
before you leave.

49
00:08:37,783 --> 00:08:40,048
- You remember the code?
- Yes, Mrs. Evelyn.

50
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:41,881
But sometimes you change it.

51
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:46,992
The first four numbers of the address,
backwards.

52
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:48,525
Okay.

53
00:08:48,828 --> 00:08:51,229
If you have any problem,
call Bob Needleman.

54
00:08:51,397 --> 00:08:54,629
- He'll get ahold of us.
- Yes, Mrs. Evelyn. I call him.

55
00:08:57,436 --> 00:08:58,460
Bye.

56
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:04,944
There she goes, Jonas.

57
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,111
Make a fucking move.

58
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:34,563
Fuck.

59
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:42,445
Fuck.

60
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,233
Fuck you.

61
00:10:09,642 --> 00:10:11,406
Fuck you.

62
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:15,682
Everybody can go fuck themselves.

63
00:10:21,821 --> 00:10:23,813
<i>If you have any problem,</i>
<i>call Bob Needleman.</i>

64
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:24,143
Holy shit.

65
00:11:31,824 --> 00:11:33,156
David?

66
00:11:35,261 --> 00:11:38,129
Can't wait to get on the plane
and have a pinot grigio.

67
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:48,935
What is that?

68
00:11:58,651 --> 00:12:00,051
Oh, fuck.

69
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:18,204
Wow, she's fucked up totally, man.

70
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:21,636
- You're gonna get lucky tonight.
- What's up, Goldilocks?

71
00:12:21,807 --> 00:12:25,266
You know where you're sleeping tonight?
You're sleeping with me!

72
00:12:25,444 --> 00:12:27,936
Kelly. What's up?

73
00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:31,516
- Hey, asshole--
- What the fuck, man? I said I'd be back.

74
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:32,879
No, you didn't.

75
00:12:33,052 --> 00:12:35,647
I did. I wrote it on your left arm.

76
00:12:36,155 --> 00:12:37,316
Your other left.

77
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,060
Whatever. I--

78
00:12:43,395 --> 00:12:44,590
Come on.

79
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:48,126
What the fuck's she on, man?
What you on?

80
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:51,202
- Who's this?
- Who me? I'm her brother, man.

81
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:52,838
- You her brother?
- Yeah.

82
00:12:53,372 --> 00:12:55,204
- We gotta get out of here.
- Where you going?

83
00:12:55,374 --> 00:12:56,672
San Diego, bro. Come on.

84
00:12:56,842 --> 00:13:00,870
- Where's the fire? Stick around.
- No, I can't. We gotta get this ride.

85
00:13:01,046 --> 00:13:02,878
Leave her with us.
Trade for some meth.

86
00:13:03,048 --> 00:13:04,846
- Yeah, that sound good to me.
- Hey!

87
00:13:05,017 --> 00:13:06,076
What the--?

88
00:13:10,022 --> 00:13:11,456
Big mistake.

89
00:13:15,828 --> 00:13:17,296
Fuck-- Fucking white boy!

90
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:19,523
- Piece of shit!
- Get back!

91
00:13:19,698 --> 00:13:21,462
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

92
00:13:21,834 --> 00:13:24,326
- Come on, Kelly. Come on.
- I don't feel so--

93
00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:29,239
- Fucking dead, white boy!
- Come on, motherfucker.

94
00:13:29,408 --> 00:13:32,503
Don't come back to Venice, ever!
Or you dead!

95
00:14:02,441 --> 00:14:03,909
Hello?

96
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,284
What do you think?

97
00:14:12,451 --> 00:14:14,317
Where are we?

98
00:14:14,954 --> 00:14:16,889
Pacific Palisades.

99
00:14:18,924 --> 00:14:21,155
How did you find this place?

100
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,424
Wasn't easy.

101
00:14:25,731 --> 00:14:27,290
It's--

102
00:14:28,434 --> 00:14:30,733
- It's--
- Fucking beautiful. Right?

103
00:14:30,903 --> 00:14:32,496
Yeah.

104
00:14:34,773 --> 00:14:37,937
Well, it's ours, for like a month.

105
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:39,868
What?

106
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,525
Jackpot.

107
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:57,127
This guy's got some taste.

108
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:00,794
You want a drink?

109
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:02,592
Sure.

110
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,906
Look, here's the family.

111
00:15:10,776 --> 00:15:12,301
The whole family.

112
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:14,947
The kids are like our age.

113
00:15:19,485 --> 00:15:21,010
Here.

114
00:15:21,487 --> 00:15:23,217
Try that.

115
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:27,121
All right, so her...

116
00:15:27,293 --> 00:15:30,457
...that's Evelyn, she's the one I saw
in the parking lot.

117
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:32,188
And that's her husband.

118
00:15:32,364 --> 00:15:33,889
David.

119
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,565
- How do you know his name?
- It's here.

120
00:15:45,911 --> 00:15:49,313
You know this is one of the most
expensive liquors in the world?

121
00:15:49,481 --> 00:15:50,744
Enjoy it.

122
00:15:54,353 --> 00:15:57,721
Should we be doing this?
I mean, it's their house.

123
00:16:03,862 --> 00:16:05,296
Tonight...

124
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:07,296
...we don't worry.

125
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,794
- About what?
- About anything.

126
00:16:12,204 --> 00:16:14,867
We're not gonna worry about
what we're gonna eat...

127
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,269
...where we'll sleep...

128
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:19,970
...who's got drugs, how we're gonna
make money, where the cops are.

129
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:21,169
Not tonight.

130
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:27,552
Tonight, we celebrate.

131
00:16:28,787 --> 00:16:30,221
Sounds good.

132
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,088
Cheers.

133
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:46,363
Oh, that's gross.

134
00:16:46,538 --> 00:16:47,699
Gross?

135
00:16:47,873 --> 00:16:50,308
It's cognac.
It's the nicest shit you can buy.

136
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:51,569
It tastes like shit.

137
00:16:53,245 --> 00:16:54,838
What would you prefer?

138
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,313
A nice, cheap whiskey or something?

139
00:16:57,483 --> 00:16:58,610
Yeah.

140
00:16:58,784 --> 00:17:00,514
Yeah, okay.

141
00:17:13,065 --> 00:17:15,091
They have everything.

142
00:17:15,267 --> 00:17:17,168
That's what I'm hoping.

143
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:25,070
Wow, that's so cool.

144
00:17:26,145 --> 00:17:29,877
Wow, that telescope's probably
worth a grand, alone.

145
00:17:32,117 --> 00:17:34,712
Wow, look at that bathtub.

146
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:41,921
You should go for it, man.

147
00:17:42,461 --> 00:17:44,930
- What?
- Take a bath. It looks awesome.

148
00:17:45,097 --> 00:17:46,429
Why not?

149
00:17:46,598 --> 00:17:48,863
I'm gonna look around
and make some food...

150
00:17:49,034 --> 00:17:51,003
...and some drinks.

151
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:54,834
- Go on, go for it.
- Okay.

152
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:23,018
Holy...

153
00:19:42,714 --> 00:19:48,585
Boy, Happiest Family in the Universe
goes to these fucks. Jesus Christ.

154
00:19:49,254 --> 00:19:51,155
All right.

155
00:19:53,091 --> 00:19:54,389
Tricky, tricky.

156
00:19:56,295 --> 00:19:57,820
David.

157
00:19:58,564 --> 00:20:00,795
Silverman.

158
00:20:03,902 --> 00:20:05,700
Evelyn.

159
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:09,397
Shit.

160
00:20:18,016 --> 00:20:19,644
Interesting.

161
00:20:40,872 --> 00:20:44,070
- Hey.
- Hey.

162
00:20:44,643 --> 00:20:48,205
Dude, you're not gonna believe
the shit I found downstairs.

163
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:49,575
Awesome.

164
00:20:50,515 --> 00:20:52,279
I'll be out in a minute.

165
00:20:52,684 --> 00:20:55,848
Just feels really good in here.

166
00:21:01,193 --> 00:21:02,593
Cool.

167
00:21:43,001 --> 00:21:45,527
I am gonna figure you out.

168
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:49,125
I've got good news
and even better news.

169
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:53,493
Jesus.

170
00:23:55,066 --> 00:23:57,331
How'd you do that?

171
00:23:59,571 --> 00:24:00,664
What do you think?

172
00:24:07,913 --> 00:24:09,711
You look rich.

173
00:24:10,248 --> 00:24:11,944
Feel like it.

174
00:24:14,686 --> 00:24:16,382
Found money.

175
00:24:20,826 --> 00:24:22,590
Seriously, how'd you do that?

176
00:24:22,761 --> 00:24:25,196
Bet you didn't think
I could look like this.

177
00:24:28,233 --> 00:24:32,671
- Did you think you could look like this?
- Honestly, no.

178
00:24:33,205 --> 00:24:35,674
But feels pretty good.

179
00:24:38,577 --> 00:24:40,409
It looks pretty good.

180
00:24:46,785 --> 00:24:48,481
- You're next.
- No.

181
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:51,179
- Come on, you have to.
- Why?

182
00:24:55,694 --> 00:24:57,595
All right, fine. I'll do it.

183
00:24:57,762 --> 00:24:59,162
Just...

184
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:01,425
- ...go watch TV or something.
- Okay.

185
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,899
- And don't come in here.
- I won't.

186
00:25:40,438 --> 00:25:41,565
Video.

187
00:25:42,274 --> 00:25:43,708
TV.

188
00:25:44,342 --> 00:25:46,243
Home movies.

189
00:25:50,782 --> 00:25:51,875
No way.

190
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:56,787
<i>Hello.</i>

191
00:25:56,955 --> 00:26:00,448
<i>- Welcome home, little baby.</i>
<i>- Everybody meet our son...</i>

192
00:26:00,625 --> 00:26:02,218
<i>...Michael Silverman.</i>

193
00:26:04,095 --> 00:26:05,996
<i>- Isn't he cute?</i>
<i>- You meet him too.</i>

194
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:22,009
<i>Can you say, "Happy Halloween"?</i>

195
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:23,808
<i>Happy Halloween.</i>

196
00:26:23,982 --> 00:26:27,544
<i>- Ready to get some candy?</i>
<i>- Are you guys ready to get some candy?</i>

197
00:26:27,719 --> 00:26:29,654
<i>Come on, you guys look great.</i>

198
00:26:46,037 --> 00:26:48,165
<i>- Hi.</i>
<i>- Hi, Dave.</i>

199
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:50,104
<i>Hi, son.</i>

200
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:51,538
<i>Hi.</i>

201
00:26:54,846 --> 00:26:57,406
<i>Ready? Try to hit it.</i>

202
00:26:57,582 --> 00:26:59,175
<i>Yeah!</i>

203
00:27:00,585 --> 00:27:02,349
<i>Are you kidding?</i>

204
00:27:05,256 --> 00:27:07,316
<i>You're a natural. Do you realize that?</i>

205
00:27:07,492 --> 00:27:11,395
<i>You're gonna be famous and rich.</i>
<i>You're so good.</i>

206
00:27:33,752 --> 00:27:38,087
<i>Okay, Mr. Silverman,</i>
<i>Mr. College Graduate.</i>

207
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:40,256
<i>What's next?</i>

208
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:45,195
<i>Well, Mr. Silverman, I think</i>
<i>the next step would be graduate school.</i>

209
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:48,395
<i>But not right away.</i>

210
00:27:49,234 --> 00:27:51,533
<i>You have all the time in the world.</i>

211
00:27:51,703 --> 00:27:54,639
<i>Three, two, one.</i>

212
00:27:54,806 --> 00:27:56,934
<i>It's a video camera, Dad.</i>

213
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:00,776
What you watching?

214
00:28:02,047 --> 00:28:03,777
Jonas.

215
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:08,509
Found the suit upstairs.
Turns out I'm a 40 regular.

216
00:28:10,288 --> 00:28:12,086
You look amazing.

217
00:28:14,993 --> 00:28:16,586
Thanks.

218
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:21,192
- Let's go out.
- What?

219
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:22,698
Come on.

220
00:28:42,687 --> 00:28:43,916
- Hang on.
- Why?

221
00:28:47,625 --> 00:28:49,150
Oh, my God!

222
00:29:01,506 --> 00:29:03,475
Jonas, why here?
We shouldn't be here.

223
00:29:03,641 --> 00:29:04,665
Relax.

224
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:08,046
No one is gonna recognize us.

225
00:29:08,446 --> 00:29:10,642
Come on, look at us.

226
00:29:19,457 --> 00:29:21,551
Relax, you'll be fine.

227
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:27,361
- For two?
- Yes, sir, <i>si.</i> Thank you.

228
00:29:27,532 --> 00:29:29,728
Right this way, please.

229
00:29:39,878 --> 00:29:41,540
Enjoy.

230
00:29:49,954 --> 00:29:53,948
Every night, when we would hit
the market next door...

231
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:56,720
...I'd see these people in here.

232
00:29:57,495 --> 00:30:00,158
I'd see what they'd order...

233
00:30:00,331 --> 00:30:03,426
...and see them drinking their fine wine.

234
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:07,071
Damn it,
that's what we're gonna have tonight.

235
00:30:07,238 --> 00:30:09,969
- Yeah.
- Fuck, I always wanted to eat here.

236
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:11,871
- Good evening.
- Hello.

237
00:30:12,043 --> 00:30:14,069
Have you been here before?

238
00:30:14,445 --> 00:30:16,141
No.

239
00:30:16,514 --> 00:30:18,983
Oh, may I suggest for you
the tasting menu?

240
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:20,743
Is that what they're having?

241
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:26,016
No, they're having a special menu
prepared by the chef.

242
00:30:26,191 --> 00:30:28,922
Okay, we'll have that as well.

243
00:30:29,093 --> 00:30:31,255
Also comes with
excellent wine pairings.

244
00:30:31,429 --> 00:30:32,988
Great, we'll have the same.

245
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:37,226
Absolutely, sir.
You will be beyond satisfied.

246
00:30:37,402 --> 00:30:39,496
That's what we want.

247
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:41,401
Are you crazy?

248
00:30:41,573 --> 00:30:44,771
- I swear that guy is famous--
- For fuck's sake, people are gonna--

249
00:30:44,943 --> 00:30:47,037
- What? People are gonna stare?
- Yeah.

250
00:30:47,212 --> 00:30:48,771
- They're gonna talk?
- Yeah.

251
00:30:48,947 --> 00:30:50,575
- They're gonna arrest you?
- Yes.

252
00:30:50,748 --> 00:30:52,580
Right. For what?

253
00:30:54,886 --> 00:30:58,880
You don't get it, do you?
We've got all the markings.

254
00:30:59,057 --> 00:31:02,858
We've got the fine cars
and the fine clothes.

255
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:05,258
Yeah, but they didn't steal it.

256
00:31:05,663 --> 00:31:07,256
Yeah, they did.

257
00:31:07,432 --> 00:31:10,527
Because if they didn't work for it,
they stole it.

258
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:12,136
What?

259
00:31:14,138 --> 00:31:16,573
Please, just try and relax.

260
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:21,779
Just enjoy it, like they do.

261
00:31:23,248 --> 00:31:25,217
Okay.

262
00:31:29,354 --> 00:31:30,845
Hey.

263
00:31:32,023 --> 00:31:35,721
It's funny.
I've got $1000 right here in my pocket.

264
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:37,760
- I want you to hang onto it.
- No.

265
00:31:37,929 --> 00:31:39,192
- Come on, hold it.
- Why?

266
00:31:39,364 --> 00:31:42,391
When was the last time
you held 1000 bucks in your hand?

267
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:49,708
Come on, feels good, doesn't it?

268
00:32:04,222 --> 00:32:07,021
That was the best meal I ever had.

269
00:32:08,459 --> 00:32:10,189
- It was pretty good.
- What?

270
00:32:10,361 --> 00:32:14,093
If that wasn't the best meal you ever had,
then who the fuck are you?

271
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:16,996
Fine, the best meal ever.

272
00:32:17,168 --> 00:32:19,034
It was, right?

273
00:32:19,737 --> 00:32:21,171
Yeah.

274
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:47,299
Keep it down.

275
00:32:59,577 --> 00:33:01,569
That's beautiful.

276
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:05,946
It's this thing my dad used to play.

277
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:13,648
Sounds sad.

278
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:17,986
Would you prefer this?

279
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:22,156
Yeah, yeah! Right on!

280
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:23,892
Shit. Get the lights.

281
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:38,449
Why did you bring me here?

282
00:33:40,818 --> 00:33:42,650
I had to.

283
00:33:42,954 --> 00:33:45,549
Those guys,
they could've fucked you up.

284
00:33:45,957 --> 00:33:49,052
You could've left me on the boardwalk
or something.

285
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:52,891
I could've.

286
00:33:53,731 --> 00:33:55,324
You didn't.

287
00:33:57,301 --> 00:33:58,769
No.

288
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:01,034
So why?

289
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:08,745
What, you want me
to spell it out for you?

290
00:34:16,454 --> 00:34:18,855
I can take care of you.

291
00:34:20,792 --> 00:34:23,227
I like taking care of you.

292
00:34:23,861 --> 00:34:26,558
I don't need you to take care of me.

293
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:29,591
I can take care of myself.

294
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:55,454
No, Jonas. No, stop. Get off.

295
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,124
I can't.

296
00:35:00,031 --> 00:35:01,932
What the hell?

297
00:35:03,968 --> 00:35:07,735
- Thought you wanted to fuck.
- I don't want to fuck.

298
00:35:07,905 --> 00:35:09,806
I'm sorry.

299
00:35:09,974 --> 00:35:12,068
I don't know what's wrong with me.

300
00:35:23,354 --> 00:35:26,552
<i>All right, ready? Do it again. Ready?</i>

301
00:35:29,427 --> 00:35:33,091
<i>Great effort. Great job waiting for it.</i>

302
00:35:37,268 --> 00:35:39,203
<i>No splashing Mommy.</i>

303
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:42,169
<i>It's day one, guys.</i>
<i>We got a whole summer.</i>

304
00:35:42,573 --> 00:35:45,509
<i>Go, go, go! Stephanie, get it! Yeah!</i>

305
00:35:45,676 --> 00:35:47,372
<i>Go!</i>

306
00:35:48,012 --> 00:35:49,503
<i>Not bad. Not bad.</i>

307
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,172
<i>- That was pretty good.</i>
<i>- He didn't get you.</i>

308
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:53,716
<i>No.</i>

309
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:14,529
Oh, shit.

310
00:36:19,477 --> 00:36:20,945
Hey.

311
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:23,413
Stay back.

312
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:31,155
- Who is it?
- I don't know.

313
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:33,855
Okay.

314
00:36:34,792 --> 00:36:36,886
Hey. Just go along with whatever I say.

315
00:36:37,061 --> 00:36:39,360
- Okay.
- Don't fuck this up.

316
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:42,026
Hey. Sorry, you scared me.

317
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,635
Yeah, I gotta get into the garage.

318
00:36:45,303 --> 00:36:46,362
Sorry, who are you?

319
00:36:46,971 --> 00:36:48,701
Who am I?

320
00:36:50,074 --> 00:36:52,066
Where's Evelyn?

321
00:36:52,243 --> 00:36:54,109
- They're on vacation.
- We're family.

322
00:36:56,647 --> 00:36:58,240
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

323
00:36:58,416 --> 00:37:00,715
Evelyn's brother's kids.

324
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:04,151
We're taking care of the house
while they're away.

325
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:07,184
Yeah, I forgot.
They went to Greece or something.

326
00:37:07,358 --> 00:37:09,725
Yeah. I'm Sarah.
This is my brother, Adam.

327
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:11,726
- Hi.
- Right on. Terrence.

328
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:15,298
I work for them. Handyman.
Totally spaced that they were gone.

329
00:37:15,466 --> 00:37:17,401
That's cool.

330
00:37:17,935 --> 00:37:22,066
I guess just wash the cars or whatever
a few days before they get back.

331
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,266
We don't need anything, right?

332
00:37:24,442 --> 00:37:26,434
- Yeah, August, right?
- I think so.

333
00:37:26,611 --> 00:37:29,080
- Can't remember the date.
- It's written down.

334
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:31,239
- Late August sounds right.
- All right.

335
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:33,111
Hey, late August, it is.

336
00:37:33,284 --> 00:37:35,446
- See you.
- Take it easy.

337
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:40,981
- Think that worked?
- Yeah.

338
00:37:41,158 --> 00:37:42,922
But what about the neighbors--

339
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:47,054
The neighbors haven't seen us yet,
and they're not going to, so relax.

340
00:37:47,999 --> 00:37:50,696
- I need to start unloading this stuff.
- What stuff?

341
00:37:50,868 --> 00:37:55,033
Stuff. The cars, paintings, the jewelry.
That's why we're here.

342
00:37:55,206 --> 00:37:58,802
Okay. There's one ring you can't hock.
It's David's father's ring.

343
00:37:58,976 --> 00:38:01,639
It's the only thing he has
to remember him by.

344
00:38:01,812 --> 00:38:03,474
What's it look like?

345
00:38:04,081 --> 00:38:07,415
It's gold, it's black onyx,
has the initials R.S. on it.

346
00:38:07,585 --> 00:38:10,054
- How do you know all this?
- The videos.

347
00:38:10,221 --> 00:38:12,383
- What videos?
- The home videos.

348
00:38:13,324 --> 00:38:15,520
Okay. I need to go and talk to this guy.

349
00:38:15,693 --> 00:38:19,027
- Just promise me?
- I won't sell this ring. I gotta go.

350
00:38:19,196 --> 00:38:20,994
Okay. I'm just gonna stay here.

351
00:38:21,832 --> 00:38:23,994
Do whatever the hell you want.

352
00:38:47,024 --> 00:38:48,788
- Here you go, man.
- For real?

353
00:38:48,959 --> 00:38:50,587
Yeah.

354
00:38:54,065 --> 00:38:55,727
Holy shit!

355
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:57,892
- What?
- What do you think, huh?

356
00:38:58,069 --> 00:39:01,437
- What? How did you--?
- It's a long, funny story, my friend.

357
00:39:01,605 --> 00:39:03,437
You a cop or some shit?
This is some Miami Vice bullshit.

358
00:39:03,607 --> 00:39:05,872
No. Come on, get in.
I wanna talk to you.

359
00:39:06,043 --> 00:39:08,603
Yeah, I'm getting in, brother. Come on.

360
00:39:08,779 --> 00:39:11,339
- Shit.
- All right.

361
00:39:12,316 --> 00:39:14,512
- Listen up, man.
- What's up?

362
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:16,745
I found a lot of shit to sell.

363
00:39:16,921 --> 00:39:18,685
Big shit, shit like this.

364
00:39:19,323 --> 00:39:21,383
- Where that shit at?
- In Malibu.

365
00:39:21,559 --> 00:39:22,720
Gotta see that shit.

366
00:39:23,894 --> 00:39:25,590
Not yet. I can't. Gotta lay low.

367
00:39:26,163 --> 00:39:29,565
Look. I wanna give you a cut
of what I sell...

368
00:39:29,734 --> 00:39:32,499
...if you know somebody big-time,
enough to handle this.

369
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:35,504
- I know somebody.
- You know somebody? You sure?

370
00:39:35,673 --> 00:39:38,905
- Yeah.
- All right, what's he into?

371
00:39:39,276 --> 00:39:42,075
Into coke,
but I think he's in some other shit.

372
00:39:42,246 --> 00:39:45,978
- What kind of other shit?
- This kind of other shit, man.

373
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:50,019
All right.
Well, look, can you set it up for tonight?

374
00:39:50,187 --> 00:39:52,986
Yeah. Yeah.

375
00:39:53,157 --> 00:39:56,753
Get the fuck out of my car.
Set it up for tonight. Some big-time.

376
00:39:57,161 --> 00:40:00,325
- You and me.
- This is flashy. You look fly, brother.

377
00:40:00,498 --> 00:40:02,126
Come on!

378
00:40:02,666 --> 00:40:04,635
Tonight, brother.

379
00:40:56,921 --> 00:40:58,856
Hi, Carol.

380
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:05,425
Oh, my baby.

381
00:41:05,596 --> 00:41:09,465
Is that my little girl?
Well, goddamn, look at you.

382
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:12,626
- You look so beautiful.
- What's going on? What'd you do?

383
00:41:12,803 --> 00:41:15,204
- What'd I do?
- I'm just so happy you're home.

384
00:41:15,372 --> 00:41:18,501
- Shut up. What'd you come here for?
- To see Mom.

385
00:41:18,676 --> 00:41:21,145
- Baby, what--? Did you get married?
- Yeah.

386
00:41:21,779 --> 00:41:25,045
I was gonna invite you,
but it happened so quick. In Maui.

387
00:41:25,216 --> 00:41:28,345
- Where?
- Hawaii, Wilerd.

388
00:41:28,519 --> 00:41:33,856
We were climbing this volcano. We got
to the top, he proposed, and I said yes.

389
00:41:34,024 --> 00:41:36,858
- Right there on top of a volcano.
- That's what I said.

390
00:41:37,027 --> 00:41:38,359
What's this one's name?

391
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:42,228
- Michael Silverman.
- Michael.

392
00:41:42,399 --> 00:41:45,267
- I think you're full of shit.
- I don't care.

393
00:41:45,436 --> 00:41:48,065
We sacrificed everything for you.
We raised you.

394
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:50,834
Yeah, you raised me up,
didn't you, Wilerd?

395
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:55,173
- If you're gonna talk like that, we'll leave.
- It's time you give back a bit.

396
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:57,577
- Where's Bobby?
- I don't know.

397
00:41:57,748 --> 00:42:00,650
Why, here he is, here he comes.
Bobby!

398
00:42:00,818 --> 00:42:03,686
Hi. Hi, Bobby. Come here.

399
00:42:04,255 --> 00:42:05,314
Hi.

400
00:42:05,489 --> 00:42:07,287
- Where have you been?
- In L.A.

401
00:42:07,458 --> 00:42:09,859
- Really?
- Yeah. I just moved into a house.

402
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:12,053
- Come visit soon.
- Does it have a pool?

403
00:42:12,229 --> 00:42:14,494
No. But it's close to the ocean.

404
00:42:14,665 --> 00:42:16,327
- Can I go now?
- Honey, no.

405
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:20,596
No, you have to go to school,
but I'll visit really soon, okay?

406
00:42:21,305 --> 00:42:25,003
Bobby, get away. She ain't
your real sister. She's foster trash.

407
00:42:25,175 --> 00:42:27,474
Shut up, Wilerd.
Get on back in the house.

408
00:42:27,645 --> 00:42:32,083
Here. Go have some fun, okay?
Don't turn into an asshole like Wilerd.

409
00:42:32,249 --> 00:42:34,275
- You heard me, boy!
- Enough! Get in.

410
00:42:34,451 --> 00:42:36,249
Mom, here.

411
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:38,753
- Oh, no. No.
- Buy yourself something nice.

412
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:44,184
Listen. You know I love you
like you're my own child. You know that.

413
00:42:44,361 --> 00:42:47,923
Yeah. I gotta go, okay?
I'll come back, okay?

414
00:42:48,098 --> 00:42:51,330
I'll bring Michael.
I want you to meet him, all right?

415
00:42:51,502 --> 00:42:54,995
- Will you do that? Please?
- I will, Mom, I swear.

416
00:43:40,718 --> 00:43:42,209
Hey.

417
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:44,855
Well, I set it up.

418
00:43:45,389 --> 00:43:48,985
- Selling all of it.
- But not the ring.

419
00:43:50,327 --> 00:43:52,387
No, not the ring.

420
00:43:52,963 --> 00:43:54,363
When?

421
00:43:54,999 --> 00:43:57,628
I'm meeting the guy tonight,
so we'll see.

422
00:43:58,435 --> 00:44:00,802
I wanna do this fast.

423
00:44:00,971 --> 00:44:03,998
Scared we're gonna get busted up here.
Pushing our luck.

424
00:44:04,174 --> 00:44:05,608
Okay.

425
00:44:05,776 --> 00:44:10,009
- You can fantasize that we belong here--
- I said okay, all right?

426
00:44:14,585 --> 00:44:16,850
This could be it, Kell.

427
00:44:17,521 --> 00:44:21,049
A score this big,
it could change everything for us.

428
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:25,488
You're really smart, Jonas.

429
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:27,564
You'll pull it off.

430
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,591
- Who the fuck are you?
- Oh, man, we good.

431
00:44:58,762 --> 00:45:01,061
- We're here to see Ronald.
- Who are you?

432
00:45:01,231 --> 00:45:04,065
I'm Al. Ronald's my man.
I sold him some shit.

433
00:45:04,234 --> 00:45:05,258
And?

434
00:45:06,003 --> 00:45:09,838
No, that's-- Just go ask him.
I'm telling you, he knows me.

435
00:45:10,007 --> 00:45:13,239
- I'm coming-- Come on, man.
- Come on.

436
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:15,140
Yeah.

437
00:45:18,649 --> 00:45:20,413
Down there.

438
00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:39,002
- I can't see him, man.
- Straight ahead.

439
00:45:41,905 --> 00:45:43,669
You have company.

440
00:45:45,275 --> 00:45:46,607
What's up? It's Al.

441
00:45:48,779 --> 00:45:49,872
Who?

442
00:45:50,047 --> 00:45:51,640
Sold crack to you on Venice--

443
00:45:53,350 --> 00:45:55,012
Motherfucker!

444
00:45:56,353 --> 00:45:57,787
Okay.

445
00:45:58,555 --> 00:46:01,184
Who's the suit? Am I being audited?

446
00:46:01,358 --> 00:46:03,759
- That's my man.
- Should we roofie him?

447
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:05,657
Come on. He's not like that--

448
00:46:05,829 --> 00:46:08,424
My name is Jonas.
I have a lot of items for sale.

449
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:10,329
- Al thought of you.
- He did?

450
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:18,368
Well, let's go take a gander.

451
00:46:19,443 --> 00:46:20,934
- Sunshine.
- Let's go gander.

452
00:46:21,111 --> 00:46:26,175
Ladies, your hot, sugar daddy cock
will be back.

453
00:46:30,187 --> 00:46:33,919
So in addition to the Cayenne
there's a 2010 Carrera...

454
00:46:34,091 --> 00:46:36,185
...loaded, mint.

455
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:39,956
And this collection of watches
and jewelry...

456
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:42,827
...some of which are antiques.

457
00:46:43,734 --> 00:46:45,202
Show me the jewels.

458
00:46:48,438 --> 00:46:53,138
I have price evaluations for these items
and the Kelley Blue Book on the cars.

459
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:59,076
Oh, I love it.

460
00:46:59,249 --> 00:47:00,979
- It'll look great on you.
- Right?

461
00:47:01,151 --> 00:47:02,642
Yeah.

462
00:47:06,023 --> 00:47:07,548
Oh, my God.

463
00:47:08,258 --> 00:47:10,818
- Oh, wait. That--
- It's my initials.

464
00:47:12,462 --> 00:47:15,626
Oh, I simply, absolutely must have this.

465
00:47:15,799 --> 00:47:18,564
I'll take the whole lot.
How much do you want?

466
00:47:19,703 --> 00:47:23,196
Thirty thousand for the jewels,
70,000 for the cars.

467
00:47:23,907 --> 00:47:27,105
One hundred thousand dollars.

468
00:47:27,644 --> 00:47:31,376
None of these items
will be reported stolen for a week.

469
00:47:31,548 --> 00:47:35,576
You can clean the cars, put a fresh coat
of paint on them, triple your money.

470
00:47:35,752 --> 00:47:37,914
Then why don't you do it yourself?

471
00:47:38,088 --> 00:47:41,490
Because I have bigger business
in Arizona.

472
00:47:43,594 --> 00:47:46,291
I can take one of the cars,
maybe the Carrera--

473
00:47:46,463 --> 00:47:49,922
I want the Carrera. I love the Carrera.
I'm keeping the Carrera.

474
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:53,593
I love the German cars.

475
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:57,565
And I'll give you 50 for the rest.

476
00:47:58,141 --> 00:48:01,669
And if you're a smart wee laddie...

477
00:48:01,945 --> 00:48:03,971
...you'll take it.

478
00:48:04,314 --> 00:48:07,216
I am smart, so no less than 80.

479
00:48:11,755 --> 00:48:14,088
Okay.

480
00:48:15,025 --> 00:48:17,290
But if you're fucking with me...

481
00:48:19,363 --> 00:48:21,525
...if you're lying to me...

482
00:48:21,698 --> 00:48:25,999
- Ronald, I wouldn't bring someone by--
- Alistair, do shut up.

483
00:48:28,438 --> 00:48:31,533
I don't know you from fucking Adam.

484
00:48:31,708 --> 00:48:34,507
I wouldn't let you suck my dick...

485
00:48:34,678 --> 00:48:39,173
...let alone vouch for this
smooth operator.

486
00:48:39,349 --> 00:48:42,376
No, I'm just saying that he-- All right.

487
00:48:45,122 --> 00:48:46,454
If you fuck with me...

488
00:48:55,032 --> 00:48:56,967
...I will kill you.

489
00:49:00,003 --> 00:49:01,938
And feed you to the coyotes.

490
00:49:05,909 --> 00:49:07,935
Do we have a deal?

491
00:49:09,646 --> 00:49:11,512
Yes, sir.

492
00:49:19,456 --> 00:49:21,049
Excellent.

493
00:49:22,359 --> 00:49:24,055
Bravo!

494
00:49:28,932 --> 00:49:30,332
How's my hair look?

495
00:49:31,134 --> 00:49:32,534
Nice.

496
00:49:32,703 --> 00:49:36,196
Haven't you ever wanted to dance
like a 14-year-old at a sleepover?

497
00:49:36,373 --> 00:49:38,899
- No, man.
- Well, then, get out!

498
00:49:39,076 --> 00:49:41,011
Sorry.

499
00:49:41,178 --> 00:49:43,147
Get out!

500
00:49:44,281 --> 00:49:45,681
Right.

501
00:49:49,019 --> 00:49:51,614
<i>Okay. To my dad.</i>

502
00:49:51,788 --> 00:49:54,553
<i>He would have been</i>
<i>85 years old today...</i>

503
00:49:54,725 --> 00:49:56,694
<i>...and he taught me...</i>

504
00:49:56,860 --> 00:50:01,594
<i>...all there was to know</i>
<i>about love and loss and...</i>

505
00:50:04,768 --> 00:50:07,704
<i>- To Pop.</i>
<i>- To Pop.</i>

506
00:50:10,107 --> 00:50:14,477
<i>- Stephanie.</i>
<i>- What? What, I'm fine. I'm fine.</i>

507
00:50:14,644 --> 00:50:16,909
<i>Stop, Mom. Stop.</i>

508
00:50:17,314 --> 00:50:18,839
<i>Oh, look, there's a camera.</i>

509
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:21,178
<i>- Look, Mom, smile. Smile.</i>
<i>- That's enough.</i>

510
00:50:21,351 --> 00:50:24,378
<i>Hey, Steph, you got a little something</i>
<i>on your face.</i>

511
00:50:24,554 --> 00:50:28,821
<i>- Michael. Turn it off.</i>
<i>- I'm fine. I'm just high.</i>

512
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:57,483
<i>Are you going to bless the meal?</i>

513
00:51:14,538 --> 00:51:17,337
<i>Michael, turn off the camera.</i>

514
00:52:33,950 --> 00:52:35,543
Okay.

515
00:52:35,785 --> 00:52:37,720
Here's a thousand.

516
00:52:39,256 --> 00:52:40,986
Just like that?

517
00:52:41,158 --> 00:52:44,890
There's another 3 when the deal is done.
That's 5 percent.

518
00:52:48,298 --> 00:52:50,164
Look at you, man.

519
00:52:50,634 --> 00:52:53,001
You ain't from the streets.

520
00:52:55,305 --> 00:52:57,240
What's that mean?

521
00:53:00,644 --> 00:53:03,079
How you know
how to do all this shit?

522
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:08,485
Might've just got lucky.

523
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:11,078
So did you, huh?

524
00:53:11,254 --> 00:53:12,847
Word.

525
00:53:14,191 --> 00:53:16,888
So tomorrow at 12.

526
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:19,825
- Yeah.
- All right, man.

527
00:53:19,996 --> 00:53:23,398
All right. Go to work tonight, buddy.

528
00:53:37,414 --> 00:53:41,579
Michael, can you tell the driver
to take my bags upstairs, please?

529
00:53:44,287 --> 00:53:47,052
Michael, did you hear me?

530
00:53:53,430 --> 00:53:56,264
Smells like smoke in here.

531
00:54:03,807 --> 00:54:07,574
Michael, did you let someone stay here
while we were gone?

532
00:54:07,744 --> 00:54:09,007
No.

533
00:54:09,179 --> 00:54:11,080
He wouldn't do something like that.

534
00:54:11,248 --> 00:54:13,843
What the hell is going on here?

535
00:54:15,885 --> 00:54:20,323
Will someone call Terrence
and ask him if he stayed over?

536
00:54:21,291 --> 00:54:23,089
He wouldn't do that.

537
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:26,560
Well, if not him, who?

538
00:54:40,510 --> 00:54:42,672
We've been robbed.

539
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:45,849
Check my jewelry.

540
00:54:47,250 --> 00:54:49,310
It's gone.

541
00:54:49,552 --> 00:54:51,453
All of it.

542
00:54:51,621 --> 00:54:53,522
And your father's ring?

543
00:54:53,690 --> 00:54:55,659
It's gone.

544
00:54:58,695 --> 00:54:59,719
Mom...

545
00:55:00,664 --> 00:55:01,893
...where's your car?

546
00:55:05,468 --> 00:55:06,902
We've been robbed.

547
00:55:07,237 --> 00:55:08,364
What?

548
00:55:18,415 --> 00:55:20,111
Okay.

549
00:56:14,037 --> 00:56:15,130
Hey.

550
00:56:27,450 --> 00:56:29,783
How much to fuck you, right now?

551
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:31,581
Can't do it, baby.

552
00:56:32,655 --> 00:56:34,146
No?

553
00:56:34,958 --> 00:56:37,325
Come on, everyone's got a price.

554
00:56:37,494 --> 00:56:39,929
My girl's got a price.

555
00:56:40,096 --> 00:56:41,724
I've got a price.

556
00:56:41,898 --> 00:56:43,127
So what's yours?

557
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:45,631
Two thousand. Cash.

558
00:56:47,704 --> 00:56:51,664
- Done.
- Come on, baby.

559
00:57:15,532 --> 00:57:16,591
Oh, fuck.

560
00:57:20,970 --> 00:57:23,439
Shit. Shit.

561
00:57:27,410 --> 00:57:30,346
- What happened?
- They came home.

562
00:57:30,613 --> 00:57:32,377
- I know.
- Where the fuck were you?

563
00:57:32,549 --> 00:57:35,781
- Where was I? I was setting shit up.
- Too late now, isn't it?

564
00:57:35,952 --> 00:57:37,614
Fuck.

565
00:57:38,021 --> 00:57:39,421
Did you sell the ring?

566
00:57:39,589 --> 00:57:42,684
- What ring?
- Oh, you did. You bastard.

567
00:57:42,859 --> 00:57:44,452
- I didn't sell the ring.
- Liar.

568
00:57:44,627 --> 00:57:47,620
- I don't give a fuck about that ring, okay?
- I did.

569
00:57:47,797 --> 00:57:50,665
Okay, great.
Well, I don't give a fuck about you.

570
00:57:50,834 --> 00:57:52,462
Pull over.

571
00:57:52,869 --> 00:57:54,895
- No, look, I'm sorry--
- Pull over.

572
00:57:55,071 --> 00:57:57,404
All right, look, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it.

573
00:57:57,574 --> 00:57:59,941
- Fuck you.
- I'm sorry!

574
00:58:00,109 --> 00:58:02,135
Just thank God you weren't pinched.

575
00:58:02,312 --> 00:58:05,339
- They're gonna figure it out, Jonas.
- They probably have.

576
00:58:05,515 --> 00:58:08,246
- Car's gonna be hot in less than an hour.
- Ditch it.

577
00:58:08,418 --> 00:58:11,513
I can't. This is the only thing
I have left in this deal.

578
00:58:13,623 --> 00:58:18,584
I just need to find another one of these
and change the plates. That's it.

579
00:58:18,995 --> 00:58:20,930
Change the plates.

580
00:58:51,961 --> 00:58:53,953
Order me a coffee. I'll be back.

581
00:58:54,130 --> 00:58:56,258
I just need to freshen up a little.

582
00:59:39,976 --> 00:59:41,569
Thanks.

583
01:02:15,364 --> 01:02:19,301
- Hi. Could I get one to see <i>The Kid?</i>
- Hi. Sure. Nine dollars.

584
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:28,554
It's an old print.

585
01:04:30,833 --> 01:04:33,234
They break sometimes.

586
01:04:33,402 --> 01:04:34,961
Yeah.

587
01:04:38,241 --> 01:04:39,766
<i>Excuse me. Miss.</i>

588
01:04:40,209 --> 01:04:42,940
You don't look like
a big Charlie Chaplin fan.

589
01:04:43,112 --> 01:04:44,136
A fan?

590
01:04:44,313 --> 01:04:46,282
That's a pretty old film.

591
01:04:46,716 --> 01:04:48,241
Yeah.

592
01:04:48,417 --> 01:04:50,477
I didn't think it would be that sad.

593
01:04:50,953 --> 01:04:52,615
Do I know you from somewhere?

594
01:04:53,689 --> 01:04:56,488
- I don't think so.
- I'm Michael.

595
01:04:58,294 --> 01:04:59,922
Kelly.

596
01:05:00,630 --> 01:05:02,394
Hi, Kelly.

597
01:05:04,033 --> 01:05:05,763
Do you drink coffee, Kelly?

598
01:05:05,935 --> 01:05:07,164
Yeah.

599
01:05:07,336 --> 01:05:09,771
- But I think I should go.
- Please?

600
01:05:10,339 --> 01:05:11,967
- Oh, I gotta go--
- Come on.

601
01:05:12,141 --> 01:05:14,110
I'll tell you how the film ends.

602
01:05:18,948 --> 01:05:20,007
Okay.

603
01:05:20,182 --> 01:05:21,673
Okay?

604
01:05:23,052 --> 01:05:24,543
Come on.

605
01:05:26,856 --> 01:05:29,121
This is really great, you know?

606
01:05:29,392 --> 01:05:30,826
What?

607
01:05:30,993 --> 01:05:33,087
A beautiful girl went to see
a Charlie Chaplin movie.

608
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:35,762
What's so great about that?

609
01:05:35,932 --> 01:05:38,265
Girls like you get into bars
without waiting.

610
01:05:38,434 --> 01:05:42,701
They don't go to old black and white
movies on the big screen by themselves.

611
01:05:42,872 --> 01:05:44,170
You don't know me.

612
01:05:44,807 --> 01:05:46,503
Oh, yeah?

613
01:05:46,776 --> 01:05:48,176
So who are you?

614
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:52,544
I'm nobody.

615
01:05:53,883 --> 01:05:54,942
I should go.

616
01:05:55,117 --> 01:05:58,610
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to make you feel uncomfortable.

617
01:05:59,255 --> 01:06:01,554
At least let me walk you home. It's late.

618
01:06:01,724 --> 01:06:03,522
I'm fine.

619
01:06:03,893 --> 01:06:06,158
Well, will you let me give you a ride?

620
01:06:06,429 --> 01:06:08,854
- Is this yours?
- Yeah.

621
01:06:09,031 --> 01:06:11,432
It drives better than it looks.

622
01:06:28,851 --> 01:06:31,252
I got a surprise for you.

623
01:06:36,826 --> 01:06:38,886
It's beautiful, isn't it?

624
01:06:39,428 --> 01:06:40,919
Yeah.

625
01:06:41,263 --> 01:06:42,629
I love it up here.

626
01:06:42,798 --> 01:06:44,926
I used to come here a lot.

627
01:06:46,102 --> 01:06:48,071
Why not anymore?

628
01:06:49,872 --> 01:06:51,932
Part of another life.

629
01:07:03,219 --> 01:07:07,156
- Sorry, I didn't mean to bring up anything.
- It's okay.

630
01:07:07,323 --> 01:07:09,155
It's over now.

631
01:07:12,962 --> 01:07:15,727
Do you have a girlfriend?

632
01:07:16,332 --> 01:07:17,823
No.

633
01:07:19,402 --> 01:07:22,270
I did. We broke up about a year ago.

634
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:25,565
Why?

635
01:07:28,044 --> 01:07:30,912
She just couldn't handle it.

636
01:07:32,815 --> 01:07:33,908
Handle what?

637
01:07:34,950 --> 01:07:36,885
I had a sister...

638
01:07:37,219 --> 01:07:40,246
...but she died about three years ago.

639
01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:42,222
I'm sorry.

640
01:07:42,391 --> 01:07:44,292
It's okay.

641
01:07:44,593 --> 01:07:46,619
She got into drugs.

642
01:07:48,731 --> 01:07:50,131
Lot of people do.

643
01:07:50,299 --> 01:07:51,733
Yeah.

644
01:07:52,902 --> 01:07:58,671
It's crazy. If you would've met Steph,
you'd never think that she'd...

645
01:07:58,841 --> 01:08:00,742
It just happens.

646
01:08:00,910 --> 01:08:05,814
Sometimes you don't know what's gonna
hook you until you try it, then it's too late.

647
01:08:08,784 --> 01:08:10,844
Yeah, I guess.

648
01:08:46,155 --> 01:08:47,817
Oh, shit.

649
01:08:47,990 --> 01:08:49,720
Wake up. Wake up. Shit.

650
01:08:50,059 --> 01:08:51,960
Shit, shit, shit.

651
01:08:52,128 --> 01:08:53,926
Sorry.

652
01:08:54,396 --> 01:08:56,365
I'm so late. Shit.

653
01:08:56,532 --> 01:08:57,830
Come on.

654
01:09:13,883 --> 01:09:15,943
I'm so late. I'm sorry.

655
01:09:16,552 --> 01:09:20,250
I have to meet my dad all the way
downtown. Are you hungry?

656
01:09:20,422 --> 01:09:22,482
You can help yourself to the fridge...

657
01:09:22,658 --> 01:09:24,854
...or take a shower, anything, okay?

658
01:09:25,027 --> 01:09:27,019
- I won't be gone very long.
- Thanks.

659
01:09:35,671 --> 01:09:40,200
- Okay. I gotta go. You good?
- Yeah.

660
01:09:40,376 --> 01:09:42,368
- You sure?
- Yeah.

661
01:09:42,845 --> 01:09:44,336
Okay.

662
01:09:45,781 --> 01:09:47,841
Will you have dinner with me tonight?

663
01:09:49,118 --> 01:09:50,848
- Sure.
- Yeah?

664
01:09:51,153 --> 01:09:52,746
Okay. Okay.

665
01:09:54,356 --> 01:09:56,222
Okay. Bye.

666
01:10:32,895 --> 01:10:34,659
<i>Thank you.</i>

667
01:10:38,901 --> 01:10:40,199
That's it.

668
01:10:40,369 --> 01:10:42,600
That's Wong's factory.

669
01:10:42,771 --> 01:10:44,501
The Chinese order is confirmed.

670
01:10:44,673 --> 01:10:45,834
That's great.

671
01:10:46,375 --> 01:10:48,139
I just wish we didn't have...

672
01:10:48,310 --> 01:10:51,678
...to come all the way back home
to get that done, but...

673
01:10:52,348 --> 01:10:53,976
Is there any news on the house?

674
01:10:54,149 --> 01:10:58,644
Yeah. Yeah.
They said that it was not uncommon.

675
01:10:58,821 --> 01:11:00,915
You know, things are bad...

676
01:11:01,090 --> 01:11:04,288
...and these things happen.
Terrence got a good look at them.

677
01:11:04,593 --> 01:11:06,494
- Wait, what?
- Yeah.

678
01:11:06,662 --> 01:11:10,121
He spoke to them. Said they were
a very nice looking young couple.

679
01:11:10,299 --> 01:11:13,064
They called themselves
Adam and Sarah, your cousins.

680
01:11:13,235 --> 01:11:15,500
- They did their homework.
- You're kidding?

681
01:11:15,671 --> 01:11:18,607
And he, the kid,
knew what he was doing.

682
01:11:18,774 --> 01:11:22,870
He got my passwords,
he got into my files, he got my gun.

683
01:11:23,045 --> 01:11:24,570
- The old six-shooter.
- Yeah.

684
01:11:24,747 --> 01:11:26,875
Surprised he didn't blow his hand off.

685
01:11:27,383 --> 01:11:30,649
It's all right. Everything's insured.

686
01:11:30,819 --> 01:11:33,812
Except for my father's ring.

687
01:11:35,291 --> 01:11:37,658
Shit. Sorry, Dad.

688
01:11:42,631 --> 01:11:44,327
Wait a minute.

689
01:11:44,500 --> 01:11:48,961
She came into the theater
and sat down right next to you?

690
01:11:49,605 --> 01:11:53,235
Didn't sit down right next to me.
She was the only person in there.

691
01:11:53,642 --> 01:11:55,201
- To see <i>The Kid?</i>
- Yeah.

692
01:11:55,377 --> 01:11:57,812
- Unbelievable.
- I know, right?

693
01:11:57,980 --> 01:12:01,348
Well, she sounds pretty interesting.

694
01:12:01,517 --> 01:12:03,213
Yeah, she's...

695
01:12:03,385 --> 01:12:05,445
She's interesting.

696
01:12:07,723 --> 01:12:08,782
And?

697
01:12:08,957 --> 01:12:10,516
And...

698
01:12:10,693 --> 01:12:13,720
- ...we're having dinner tonight.
- Yeah.

699
01:12:13,896 --> 01:12:16,161
That's the way it starts.

700
01:12:17,166 --> 01:12:19,101
- What's that?
- Love.

701
01:12:19,268 --> 01:12:21,737
- Dad. Come on.
- No, that's the way love starts.

702
01:12:22,438 --> 01:12:24,737
How do you know it's love, though?

703
01:12:25,207 --> 01:12:26,766
Well...

704
01:12:27,376 --> 01:12:31,507
...for someone to find true love
in their twenties, that's rare.

705
01:12:31,780 --> 01:12:35,774
So if it's not true love,
at least it's great practice.

706
01:12:35,951 --> 01:12:38,216
And if it is true love...

707
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:40,489
...then it's a blessing.

708
01:12:40,823 --> 01:12:43,054
And you can't ignore that.

709
01:13:57,866 --> 01:14:02,065
- Hi. Can I get a one way to Barstow?
- Fifty-five.

710
01:14:54,957 --> 01:14:56,619
I'm sorry.

711
01:14:56,792 --> 01:14:58,488
I tried.

712
01:15:57,686 --> 01:15:59,211
Hey.

713
01:15:59,821 --> 01:16:00,914
You okay?

714
01:16:01,857 --> 01:16:03,086
Yeah.

715
01:16:03,258 --> 01:16:04,783
I'm good.

716
01:16:07,029 --> 01:16:09,225
What are your plans today?

717
01:16:09,598 --> 01:16:11,226
I don't know.

718
01:16:14,536 --> 01:16:16,596
Will you spend the day with me?

719
01:17:41,189 --> 01:17:43,090
This is nice.

720
01:17:49,765 --> 01:17:51,233
What?

721
01:17:56,338 --> 01:17:58,898
I love spending time with you.

722
01:18:12,087 --> 01:18:14,352
Will you go to dinner with me tonight?

723
01:18:14,756 --> 01:18:16,452
Okay.

724
01:18:16,992 --> 01:18:18,688
At my parents' house?

725
01:18:19,227 --> 01:18:20,820
Yeah, I know it sounds weird.

726
01:18:20,996 --> 01:18:23,795
It's a Passover dinner.
It's a religious thing...

727
01:18:23,965 --> 01:18:25,866
...but it'll be fun.

728
01:18:26,735 --> 01:18:28,397
I don't know.

729
01:18:29,171 --> 01:18:30,969
I don't think that's a good idea.

730
01:18:31,139 --> 01:18:32,767
Why not?

731
01:18:33,341 --> 01:18:34,741
I don't know. I--

732
01:18:34,910 --> 01:18:38,642
Listen. You have nothing
to worry about. They're really nice.

733
01:18:38,814 --> 01:18:42,046
And I just-- I'd like you to meet them.

734
01:18:42,451 --> 01:18:43,475
Please?

735
01:18:46,254 --> 01:18:48,120
Let me think about it, okay?

736
01:18:48,290 --> 01:18:50,088
Okay.

737
01:19:09,177 --> 01:19:10,270
Ronald, what's up?

738
01:19:10,445 --> 01:19:13,210
Where the bloody hell
is my Porsche Carrera?

739
01:19:13,381 --> 01:19:15,543
Look, there was a bit of a problem.

740
01:19:15,717 --> 01:19:17,583
But here's what I'm gonna do, okay?

741
01:19:17,753 --> 01:19:22,657
I'm gonna sell you the Cayenne for half
and then we'll just call it even. Cool?

742
01:19:25,026 --> 01:19:27,154
Are you fucking kidding me?

743
01:19:27,329 --> 01:19:29,161
No, it's a good car.

744
01:19:29,331 --> 01:19:32,665
I wouldn't give that car to my mother.

745
01:19:32,834 --> 01:19:34,496
Do I look like a soccer mommy?

746
01:19:34,669 --> 01:19:37,867
- "Get in the back of the car, kids."
- No.

747
01:19:38,940 --> 01:19:40,306
- We made a deal...
- I know.

748
01:19:40,475 --> 01:19:42,000
...for the Porsche Carrera.

749
01:19:42,177 --> 01:19:44,646
There was a problem, all right, man?
I'm sorry.

750
01:19:44,813 --> 01:19:46,975
I can sell you this for half.

751
01:19:47,816 --> 01:19:50,684
- You believe this guy, Sammy?
- Well, it's a good car.

752
01:19:50,852 --> 01:19:51,979
Go on, sunshine.

753
01:19:52,154 --> 01:19:53,383
Oh, whoa, hey, hey.

754
01:19:53,555 --> 01:19:55,319
No, no, no, please don't.

755
01:19:55,490 --> 01:19:56,981
I can get it.

756
01:19:57,159 --> 01:19:59,355
I can get you the car. I'll get it.

757
01:19:59,528 --> 01:20:01,224
- I will take a finger...
- No.

758
01:20:01,396 --> 01:20:05,891
...for every day that you do not bring me
my Porsche Carrera.

759
01:20:06,067 --> 01:20:09,196
No, please, I'll get it.
I'll get the Carrera, I'll get it.

760
01:20:09,371 --> 01:20:10,464
I'll get it.

761
01:20:10,639 --> 01:20:13,575
- Told you not to fuck with me, right?
- Yes, and I won't.

762
01:20:13,742 --> 01:20:17,304
- Yeah? Did I not?
- I'll get it, I'll get it.

763
01:20:17,479 --> 01:20:20,540
Not so fucking shiny and smooth now,
are you, motherfucker?

764
01:20:20,715 --> 01:20:21,978
Okay.

765
01:20:22,150 --> 01:20:23,174
Okay, I'll get it.

766
01:20:23,351 --> 01:20:25,013
Please don't, please don't.

767
01:20:25,187 --> 01:20:26,712
Please don't, no.

768
01:20:28,590 --> 01:20:30,058
Fuck!

769
01:20:33,762 --> 01:20:36,926
Be warned, you little cunt!

770
01:20:38,033 --> 01:20:39,695
I'll get it.

771
01:20:40,769 --> 01:20:42,863
I'll get you the car.

772
01:20:43,038 --> 01:20:45,200
Didn't they shoot <i>Grease</i> here, Sammy?

773
01:20:45,373 --> 01:20:48,400
You know, boss, I think they did.

774
01:21:01,456 --> 01:21:03,391
- You on your way yet?
<i>- We're leaving.</i>

775
01:21:03,558 --> 01:21:04,617
<i>Well, don't be late.</i>

776
01:21:04,793 --> 01:21:06,762
I will not be late, I promise.

777
01:21:06,928 --> 01:21:09,921
- Michael, love you.
<i>- I love you too.</i>

778
01:21:10,098 --> 01:21:11,396
Bye.

779
01:21:11,566 --> 01:21:15,162
- Can I help you with anything?
- No.

780
01:21:15,337 --> 01:21:16,999
- Jeez.
- Actually...

781
01:21:18,240 --> 01:21:19,765
You ready?

782
01:21:19,941 --> 01:21:22,467
Can you pour me a glass of wine?

783
01:21:24,479 --> 01:21:25,879
Are you nervous?

784
01:21:26,047 --> 01:21:28,278
Of course, I'm meeting your parents.

785
01:21:28,450 --> 01:21:30,612
They're gonna love you.

786
01:21:31,253 --> 01:21:32,312
I'm not Jewish.

787
01:21:32,487 --> 01:21:35,184
- Don't know anything about Passover.
- That's okay.

788
01:21:35,357 --> 01:21:37,155
Hey, look at me.

789
01:21:38,593 --> 01:21:41,153
It's gonna be fine. It's just a party.

790
01:21:41,496 --> 01:21:43,124
How bad could it be?

791
01:21:44,866 --> 01:21:47,768
- Okay.
- It's gonna be fine.

792
01:21:48,403 --> 01:21:50,099
Let's go.

793
01:22:04,753 --> 01:22:06,415
Perfect.

794
01:22:15,030 --> 01:22:18,432
- He's excited.
- He sounds mature.

795
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:21,900
- Like I did when I first met you.
- Mature?

796
01:22:42,190 --> 01:22:43,818
Are you good?

797
01:22:52,300 --> 01:22:53,791
Hey, Dad.

798
01:22:53,969 --> 01:22:55,904
Happy Pesach to you.

799
01:22:56,071 --> 01:22:57,164
Happy Pesach, Dad.

800
01:22:57,339 --> 01:23:00,104
This is Kelly.
Kelly, my father, David.

801
01:23:00,275 --> 01:23:01,709
Happy Pesach to you.

802
01:23:02,844 --> 01:23:06,872
It's such a great pleasure to meet you.

803
01:23:07,382 --> 01:23:08,907
Please, come in.

804
01:23:09,084 --> 01:23:10,712
Thank you.

805
01:23:23,398 --> 01:23:26,425
- It's nice, huh?
- It's amazing.

806
01:23:27,002 --> 01:23:28,470
Michael.

807
01:23:31,406 --> 01:23:32,430
Thanks.

808
01:23:32,607 --> 01:23:35,372
- I don't suppose you'd--
- Sure I will.

809
01:23:35,543 --> 01:23:37,102
- Really?
- Yeah.

810
01:23:37,278 --> 01:23:39,076
All right.

811
01:23:39,247 --> 01:23:42,843
- I like you more and more.
- Thanks.

812
01:23:45,286 --> 01:23:47,187
When did you have your first cigar?

813
01:23:47,355 --> 01:23:49,051
When?

814
01:23:49,791 --> 01:23:51,123
I was 31.

815
01:23:52,327 --> 01:23:57,163
I was hanging out with some guys
who liked to smoke.

816
01:23:59,234 --> 01:24:01,499
It wasn't the taste
and it wasn't the smoke.

817
01:24:01,669 --> 01:24:04,798
It was the idea, you know?

818
01:24:04,973 --> 01:24:09,104
That that's what they did at the top.

819
01:24:09,277 --> 01:24:11,576
And that's what I wanted.

820
01:24:12,047 --> 01:24:14,812
I wanted to be right at the top.

821
01:24:15,850 --> 01:24:17,944
Looks like you made it.

822
01:24:20,255 --> 01:24:22,087
Almost.

823
01:24:23,892 --> 01:24:25,952
Almost, kiddo.

824
01:24:33,935 --> 01:24:34,959
Come, come.

825
01:24:50,518 --> 01:24:52,009
Wow, look at that.

826
01:24:52,187 --> 01:24:53,587
Yeah, look at that.

827
01:24:54,889 --> 01:24:56,255
You know the drill.

828
01:24:56,424 --> 01:24:57,756
We record everything.

829
01:24:58,326 --> 01:25:01,319
- Everything.
- Everything.

830
01:25:01,496 --> 01:25:03,124
That's great.

831
01:25:03,298 --> 01:25:05,267
It's been a while.

832
01:25:05,433 --> 01:25:06,833
It's a good occasion.

833
01:25:07,001 --> 01:25:08,867
It's a great occasion.

834
01:25:09,270 --> 01:25:11,205
And it's great to have you with us.

835
01:25:12,107 --> 01:25:13,803
Thank you.

836
01:25:13,975 --> 01:25:16,342
All right, well, let's get
to the Hebrew...

837
01:25:16,511 --> 01:25:19,003
...the lamb shank, wicked child,
all that stuff.

838
01:25:19,180 --> 01:25:21,012
No, we can skip all that tonight.

839
01:25:21,182 --> 01:25:24,812
Let's just make this about the family...

840
01:25:24,986 --> 01:25:27,751
...and the love that's at this table.

841
01:25:28,523 --> 01:25:32,255
And I guarantee you, in 20 years...

842
01:25:32,427 --> 01:25:35,022
...you'll understand
how important that is.

843
01:25:35,196 --> 01:25:37,665
- Come on, Dad.
- It's okay.

844
01:25:37,832 --> 01:25:39,767
A lot of people don't have this.

845
01:25:39,934 --> 01:25:45,373
You have a beautiful family
and it's great to be part of it tonight.

846
01:25:45,907 --> 01:25:47,500
Thank you.

847
01:25:50,378 --> 01:25:56,010
Okay, Michael, why don't you go
to the door and invite Elijah in?

848
01:25:58,653 --> 01:26:00,246
Elijah is a prophet.

849
01:26:00,421 --> 01:26:05,587
He represents everyone who is in need
and is always welcome.

850
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:09,356
Yeah, and he looks like Superman
with a big star on his chest.

851
01:26:10,732 --> 01:26:12,667
- Come on.
- All right.

852
01:26:19,641 --> 01:26:21,473
It's been too long.

853
01:26:22,977 --> 01:26:24,036
Go in there.

854
01:26:26,614 --> 01:26:28,207
Mike?

855
01:26:29,184 --> 01:26:31,312
- Please, don't.
- Sit down.

856
01:26:31,486 --> 01:26:32,852
You shut up.

857
01:26:35,390 --> 01:26:39,259
I'm not who you were expecting, huh?

858
01:26:39,427 --> 01:26:42,022
Please don't point my gun at anyone.

859
01:26:42,830 --> 01:26:44,765
- Please.
- Your gun?

860
01:26:44,933 --> 01:26:48,131
This isn't your gun anymore, okay?

861
01:26:48,670 --> 01:26:52,971
I'm so sorry to interrupt dinner,
all of you looking so...

862
01:26:53,141 --> 01:26:55,440
...so presentable.

863
01:26:56,711 --> 01:27:00,113
But, you know, from the outside,
you never see the whole truth.

864
01:27:00,281 --> 01:27:02,580
Please,
you can have anything you want.

865
01:27:02,750 --> 01:27:04,048
Hey, take it easy.

866
01:27:04,219 --> 01:27:06,882
- How about instead I pull this trigger?
- Jonas.

867
01:27:07,055 --> 01:27:09,957
Jonas, you win, okay?
This has nothing to do with you.

868
01:27:10,124 --> 01:27:11,490
You're full of shit.

869
01:27:11,659 --> 01:27:15,152
- Do you know this person?
- Yeah.

870
01:27:16,130 --> 01:27:17,154
Yeah.

871
01:27:20,001 --> 01:27:21,299
- Yeah.
- It was you?

872
01:27:21,469 --> 01:27:23,961
Wait, Michael.

873
01:27:24,138 --> 01:27:26,232
- It was you two?
- I'm sorry.

874
01:27:26,407 --> 01:27:28,171
- You lied to me?
- Yeah.

875
01:27:28,343 --> 01:27:30,437
- You lied to me and you set us up.
- No.

876
01:27:30,612 --> 01:27:32,672
- Yeah, something like that, man.
- No.

877
01:27:33,414 --> 01:27:35,246
This was all a fucking con?

878
01:27:35,416 --> 01:27:38,909
You know what, man?
It's called survival.

879
01:27:39,087 --> 01:27:41,989
- In the real world, it's called survival.
- Jonas.

880
01:27:42,156 --> 01:27:44,022
I don't know what a con is anymore.

881
01:27:44,192 --> 01:27:47,287
- You are not who you say you are.
- Don't know what you're talking about.

882
01:27:47,462 --> 01:27:50,955
I am so sick of you and your family
and your fucking house.

883
01:27:51,132 --> 01:27:52,794
Then get the fuck out.

884
01:27:52,967 --> 01:27:54,094
No.

885
01:27:55,003 --> 01:27:58,599
- Sit down.
- You can have anything you want.

886
01:27:58,773 --> 01:28:01,004
Whatever I want?

887
01:28:01,175 --> 01:28:02,700
- I want your car.
- Okay.

888
01:28:02,877 --> 01:28:04,470
The Porsche. The Carrera.

889
01:28:04,646 --> 01:28:05,705
Great.

890
01:28:11,252 --> 01:28:13,778
Kelly, now we go.

891
01:28:13,955 --> 01:28:15,514
Kelly.

892
01:28:17,525 --> 01:28:18,959
Just leave.

893
01:28:19,127 --> 01:28:20,322
- I'm sorry.
- Just leave.

894
01:28:20,495 --> 01:28:23,055
- I'm sorry, I didn't--
- Kelly.

895
01:28:23,231 --> 01:28:24,859
Up.

896
01:28:47,221 --> 01:28:50,521
What the hell did you think
you were trying to pull back there?

897
01:28:50,692 --> 01:28:53,059
Be one of them,
be nice and pretty and rich?

898
01:28:53,227 --> 01:28:57,255
Well, you're not.
You are shit, Kelly.

899
01:28:57,432 --> 01:29:00,527
You're trash, like me.

900
01:29:03,905 --> 01:29:06,670
The question is,
what the fuck you're gonna do now...

901
01:29:06,841 --> 01:29:10,141
...after I've made the deal
and I'm sitting pretty in Mexico...

902
01:29:10,311 --> 01:29:13,076
...off the grid and you're up here
running from cops?

903
01:29:13,247 --> 01:29:18,117
Because they'll never let you go.
That's how it works in this world.

904
01:29:28,463 --> 01:29:29,761
Here.

905
01:29:31,599 --> 01:29:32,931
Sammy, check it out.

906
01:29:34,035 --> 01:29:36,061
You got a bathroom?

907
01:29:36,371 --> 01:29:39,273
It's a fucking house,
we have the whole jamboree--

908
01:29:39,440 --> 01:29:41,875
- Don't need bathroom, we're leaving.
- Fuck you.

909
01:29:42,043 --> 01:29:43,944
I need to take a piss.

910
01:29:44,112 --> 01:29:45,808
Oh, firecracker.

911
01:29:45,980 --> 01:29:48,040
- Is she negotiable too?
- No, she's not.

912
01:29:48,216 --> 01:29:50,776
- She's with me.
- I'm not with you.

913
01:29:50,952 --> 01:29:53,285
My price is fixed,
it's too high for Jonas.

914
01:29:53,454 --> 01:29:55,047
Do you think I can afford you?

915
01:29:55,990 --> 01:29:58,391
You think I can take a piss?

916
01:29:59,560 --> 01:30:02,257
Sure, down the stairs on the left.

917
01:30:11,172 --> 01:30:12,902
What a cunty little minx she is.

918
01:30:31,259 --> 01:30:33,490
<i>911, what's your emergency?</i>

919
01:30:33,661 --> 01:30:36,790
There's a robbery taking place
at 734 Sycamore in Hollywood.

920
01:30:36,964 --> 01:30:39,092
They have guns,
they're going to kill me.

921
01:30:39,267 --> 01:30:41,498
<i>Stay with me.</i>
<i>I'm sending a police car now.</i>

922
01:30:41,669 --> 01:30:42,898
<i>What's your name?</i>

923
01:30:56,851 --> 01:30:59,650
- Here's our little delight.
- Let's go.

924
01:30:59,821 --> 01:31:01,153
I thought about it.

925
01:31:01,722 --> 01:31:02,985
And I want a new daddy.

926
01:31:03,458 --> 01:31:05,893
I want him to keep me safe
and warm at night.

927
01:31:08,663 --> 01:31:10,757
- Nice ring.
- Oh, yes, thank you.

928
01:31:10,932 --> 01:31:15,495
That's me, Ronald Smythe,
at your service.

929
01:31:15,670 --> 01:31:17,832
Kelly, what the fuck are you doing?

930
01:31:18,005 --> 01:31:22,101
She's getting me fucking hard,
that's what she's doing.

931
01:31:25,480 --> 01:31:27,244
Very cute.

932
01:31:27,982 --> 01:31:29,177
Now, hand it back.

933
01:31:30,418 --> 01:31:32,319
It's not your ring.

934
01:31:32,854 --> 01:31:34,652
Excuse me?

935
01:31:34,822 --> 01:31:36,791
- Were you not listen--
- You're a liar.

936
01:31:36,958 --> 01:31:38,017
- Don't pull this shit.
- So are you.

937
01:31:38,192 --> 01:31:39,216
Give back the ring.

938
01:31:41,496 --> 01:31:43,761
If I were you, I'd listen to your friend.

939
01:31:43,931 --> 01:31:48,062
Spit the ring out.

940
01:31:51,038 --> 01:31:52,529
No?

941
01:31:58,880 --> 01:32:00,041
Okay.

942
01:32:00,848 --> 01:32:03,340
Hey, come on, she'll give it back.

943
01:32:04,051 --> 01:32:05,747
Give it back to me.
Come on, now.

944
01:32:05,920 --> 01:32:07,183
- Let's have it.
- Come on.

945
01:32:07,355 --> 01:32:08,880
Spit it out.

946
01:32:09,056 --> 01:32:14,324
Spit my fucking ring out
or you will be spitting fucking blood.

947
01:32:14,495 --> 01:32:15,724
Spit it out!

948
01:32:20,368 --> 01:32:21,961
Spit it out.

949
01:32:22,904 --> 01:32:24,702
Give it to Daddy.

950
01:32:30,645 --> 01:32:33,672
What are we gonna do
with this little trollop, huh?

951
01:32:33,848 --> 01:32:36,215
Just don't hurt her, all right?

952
01:32:36,884 --> 01:32:38,876
A naughty girl, that's what you are.

953
01:32:50,031 --> 01:32:52,626
- I came a bit then.
- Give it back to him now.

954
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:55,292
How's that hanging, yeah?
How you feeling there?

955
01:32:55,469 --> 01:32:57,062
It's good? You staying strong?

956
01:32:57,638 --> 01:33:00,904
- Stop it!
- "Stop it!"

957
01:33:04,211 --> 01:33:06,009
You're a brave one.

958
01:33:06,180 --> 01:33:08,547
You're a very brave girl.

959
01:33:09,250 --> 01:33:10,843
You women are all the same.

960
01:33:11,252 --> 01:33:12,720
You're all cunts.

961
01:33:12,887 --> 01:33:14,856
You're all cunts.

962
01:33:21,529 --> 01:33:25,625
- That's it. I have a gun to your head!
- Perfect.

963
01:33:25,800 --> 01:33:27,928
I got a gun to your head!

964
01:33:28,836 --> 01:33:30,031
I love you.

965
01:33:45,987 --> 01:33:47,956
You hear me? I will fucking kill you!

966
01:33:48,122 --> 01:33:50,318
- Shoot this motherfucker.
- Freeze, police!

967
01:33:50,491 --> 01:33:51,618
Gun.

968
01:34:41,375 --> 01:34:43,970
- Detective Matthews.
- Mrs. Silverman, how are you?

969
01:34:44,145 --> 01:34:45,875
- Good.
- You look lovely today.

970
01:34:46,047 --> 01:34:48,312
Thank you. David.

971
01:34:48,983 --> 01:34:50,781
- Hey.
- Mr. Silverman.

972
01:34:50,951 --> 01:34:54,217
Well, I am happy to report
that we recovered your belongings.

973
01:34:54,388 --> 01:34:56,380
Really?

974
01:34:56,557 --> 01:34:59,493
Two cars and looks like a lot of jewelry.

975
01:34:59,660 --> 01:35:01,788
How did you manage to do that?

976
01:35:01,962 --> 01:35:06,058
Get this, Bonnie and Clyde
had a little bit of a falling out.

977
01:35:06,233 --> 01:35:09,829
She ratted him out,
called 911 from the bathroom.

978
01:35:10,004 --> 01:35:13,372
It was crazy, big shoot-out.
But she definitely paid the price.

979
01:35:13,541 --> 01:35:15,874
- What are you talking about?
- She's in ICU.

980
01:35:16,043 --> 01:35:17,238
- What hospital?
- What--?

981
01:35:17,411 --> 01:35:21,041
- The girl, what hospital?
- County Hospital.

982
01:35:22,316 --> 01:35:23,807
Michael.

983
01:35:32,626 --> 01:35:36,222
Hi, I'm looking for Kelly Tanner.

984
01:35:36,397 --> 01:35:38,229
Kelly Tanner. Thank you so--

985
01:35:39,767 --> 01:35:41,167
Oh, Kelly.

986
01:35:41,969 --> 01:35:43,562
Is she gonna be okay?

987
01:35:43,738 --> 01:35:45,900
Doctor says she's gonna be fine.
Family?

988
01:35:46,807 --> 01:35:48,605
No, I'm just a friend.

989
01:35:48,776 --> 01:35:52,611
- I'm not supposed to allow you in here.
- Ma'am, please.

990
01:35:53,247 --> 01:35:54,943
Please.

991
01:35:55,683 --> 01:35:59,245
- Haven't seen anybody else coming in.
- Thank you so much. Thank you.

992
01:35:59,420 --> 01:36:01,446
- Keep it short.
- Okay.

993
01:36:04,592 --> 01:36:06,288
Oh, Kelly, I'm so sorry.
Oh, my God.

994
01:36:09,163 --> 01:36:10,995
Oh, my God.

995
01:36:18,139 --> 01:36:22,167
That was the only thing she had on her.
Wouldn't let go of it for dear life.

996
01:36:22,343 --> 01:36:24,778
Not even in her sleep.

997
01:36:54,809 --> 01:36:56,937
<i>All right, this is her first ride.</i>

998
01:36:57,111 --> 01:36:58,135
<i>You can do it.</i>

999
01:36:59,180 --> 01:37:01,376
<i>Yeah, you can stand--</i>
<i>Stephanie, stand.</i>

1000
01:37:01,549 --> 01:37:04,678
<i>Push down with the right foot.</i>
<i>Down with the left.</i>

1001
01:37:04,852 --> 01:37:06,821
<i>Keep it straight.</i>
<i>Look ahead at Mommy.</i>

1002
01:37:06,987 --> 01:37:09,149
<i>Look straight ahead.</i>
<i>You're doing it.</i>

1003
01:37:09,323 --> 01:37:10,586
<i>You're doing it.</i>

1004
01:37:10,758 --> 01:37:14,160
<i>- I got you.</i>
<i>- Come on, come on, she's doing it.</i>

1005
01:37:14,328 --> 01:37:17,127
<i>- Oh, my God, let go.</i>
<i>- I'm not holding you.</i>

1006
01:37:17,298 --> 01:37:20,496
<i>- I'm not even holding you.</i>
<i>- Look, Ma, no hands.</i>

1007
01:37:20,668 --> 01:37:24,605
<i>- Good girl, give me five.</i>
<i>- I'm not holding you.</i>

1008
01:37:24,772 --> 01:37:28,004
<i>That was so good, sweetie.</i>

1009
01:37:44,058 --> 01:37:45,526
Kelly.

1010
01:37:49,663 --> 01:37:51,029
Hi.

1011
01:37:53,601 --> 01:37:55,229
You look better.

1012
01:37:58,806 --> 01:38:00,570
Kelly, this is my lawyer.

1013
01:38:01,408 --> 01:38:03,434
Kelly, hi.

1014
01:38:03,611 --> 01:38:06,445
- Hi.
- I wanna talk about your confession.

1015
01:38:06,614 --> 01:38:07,980
What about it?

1016
01:38:08,148 --> 01:38:11,448
Well, Jonas' father
is a very wealthy man...

1017
01:38:11,619 --> 01:38:14,748
...and he wants to help you
to pay your medical bills...

1018
01:38:14,922 --> 01:38:19,656
...and to offer my counsel
in your defense if you need it.

1019
01:38:20,294 --> 01:38:22,388
Why would he do that?

1020
01:38:22,563 --> 01:38:25,931
Because you would sign this testimony
which states that...

1021
01:38:26,100 --> 01:38:30,401
...Ronald Smythe
threatened Jonas' life...

1022
01:38:30,571 --> 01:38:33,666
...and forced him to rob
the Silvermans at gunpoint.

1023
01:38:33,841 --> 01:38:37,676
- That's bullshit.
- You don't know that for sure, do you?

1024
01:38:38,078 --> 01:38:40,047
You're such a coward.

1025
01:38:40,214 --> 01:38:42,046
- Miss Tanner.
- Go fuck yourself.

1026
01:38:42,216 --> 01:38:44,242
- Will you step outside, please?
- Jonas.

1027
01:38:44,418 --> 01:38:47,786
Just give us a minute.
Just take a walk.

1028
01:39:02,136 --> 01:39:07,598
You remember you asked me one time
how I wound up on the street?

1029
01:39:09,643 --> 01:39:11,009
Yeah.

1030
01:39:13,814 --> 01:39:15,976
It's because my dad kicked me out.

1031
01:39:17,351 --> 01:39:18,717
Why?

1032
01:39:21,789 --> 01:39:23,724
Because we hate each other.

1033
01:39:26,827 --> 01:39:31,993
One night he took a swing at me
after I got the tattoo...

1034
01:39:32,166 --> 01:39:36,604
...and he hit me so fucking hard
it landed me in the hospital for a week.

1035
01:39:39,940 --> 01:39:42,068
Sounds like an asshole.

1036
01:39:43,077 --> 01:39:44,636
He is.

1037
01:39:46,246 --> 01:39:48,408
That's why you gotta sign
this document...

1038
01:39:48,582 --> 01:39:50,710
...and have him pay
for your medical bills.

1039
01:39:53,687 --> 01:39:55,986
I should probably sign it.

1040
01:40:01,595 --> 01:40:03,359
But I can't.

1041
01:40:04,565 --> 01:40:07,057
I'm not lying or cheating anymore.

1042
01:40:08,035 --> 01:40:10,197
I'm telling the fucking truth in court.

1043
01:40:11,405 --> 01:40:13,465
You're making a mistake.

1044
01:40:15,309 --> 01:40:17,403
That's what I always do.

1045
01:40:29,723 --> 01:40:31,715
Jonas Trumball?

1046
01:40:33,027 --> 01:40:38,398
Fine of $50,000 and 200 hours
of community service.

1047
01:40:39,833 --> 01:40:42,564
I'd say you got off easy, Jonas.
Wouldn't you?

1048
01:40:42,736 --> 01:40:44,762
Thank you, Your Honor.

1049
01:40:44,938 --> 01:40:46,634
Get out of my courtroom.

1050
01:40:52,146 --> 01:40:54,115
Kelly Tanner.

1051
01:40:54,882 --> 01:40:56,077
Yes?

1052
01:40:56,784 --> 01:41:01,552
Breaking and entering, theft,
six months sentence, no parole.

1053
01:41:01,722 --> 01:41:04,749
Pleaded guilty. Turned yourself in.

1054
01:41:06,160 --> 01:41:07,822
Do you think you belong here?

1055
01:41:08,662 --> 01:41:10,460
It's the penalty, isn't it?

1056
01:41:10,631 --> 01:41:14,432
For breaking the law, for lying,
for stealing?

1057
01:41:14,601 --> 01:41:16,570
Just let me pay it.

1058
01:41:17,438 --> 01:41:18,997
Okay.

1059
01:41:19,306 --> 01:41:21,605
See your parole officer
on your first day.

1060
01:41:21,775 --> 01:41:24,745
He or she can lay out the obligations
of being on parole.

1061
01:41:24,912 --> 01:41:27,643
They're easy. Stay out of trouble.

1062
01:41:27,815 --> 01:41:29,215
I will.

1063
01:42:24,905 --> 01:42:26,430
Kelly.

1064
01:42:38,118 --> 01:42:40,212
Oh, I missed you.

1065
01:42:40,387 --> 01:42:43,289
- Michael--
- Hey, it's okay.

1066
01:42:43,457 --> 01:42:45,949
It's okay, we'll figure it out, okay?
