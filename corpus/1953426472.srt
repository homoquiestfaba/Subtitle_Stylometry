1
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,400
- Hey, Bish.
- Morning, Jamie.

2
00:02:27,536 --> 00:02:30,096
Have you heard from Jared?
How's he doing?

3
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,036
His new companion's
kind of weird.

4
00:02:32,207 --> 00:02:33,766
But they got
a couple baptisms.

5
00:02:33,943 --> 00:02:35,877
Well,
good for him.

6
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:24,990
Hey, Wes.

7
00:03:25,131 --> 00:03:26,860
Hey, April.
How's little Mac?

8
00:03:26,999 --> 00:03:28,523
- Hey, Bishop.
- How's the bun?

9
00:03:28,668 --> 00:03:31,193
- The bun's fine, thanks.
- It's the oven we're worried about.

10
00:03:31,337 --> 00:03:32,998
The oven is fine, too.

11
00:03:33,139 --> 00:03:35,107
Wes,
Sister Perkins is inside.

12
00:03:35,241 --> 00:03:37,334
I don't know what she wants.
She won't talk to me.

13
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:39,569
All right.

14
00:03:43,183 --> 00:03:45,378
- Your check's the receipt.
- Thanks, Peg.

15
00:03:46,787 --> 00:03:49,347
- Morning, Bishop.
- Morning, Barbara.

16
00:03:49,489 --> 00:03:52,481
Well, look who finally decided
to drag his butt out of bed.

17
00:03:52,626 --> 00:03:54,890
Don't know why everybody
calls you Bishop.

18
00:03:55,028 --> 00:03:57,121
Maybe that's because
he's the bishop.

19
00:03:57,264 --> 00:03:59,790
He's a bishop.
There's 1 7 bishops in this town

20
00:03:59,934 --> 00:04:01,299
but there's only one sheriff.

21
00:04:01,436 --> 00:04:03,529
- Anything important in here?
- Is there ever?

22
00:04:03,671 --> 00:04:07,937
Besides, bishops aren't
supposed to have mustaches.

23
00:04:08,076 --> 00:04:09,600
Just trying to be
more like Jesus.

24
00:04:09,744 --> 00:04:12,941
They're also not supposed
to be smart-alecks.

25
00:04:13,114 --> 00:04:15,276
Judy Perkins.

26
00:04:15,451 --> 00:04:17,646
- What am l, invisible here?
- I already told you...

27
00:04:17,786 --> 00:04:20,550
you've been dead for six weeks.
You just don't know it.

28
00:04:20,689 --> 00:04:23,749
- Good morning, Stu.
- Morning, Sheriff.

29
00:04:25,661 --> 00:04:27,686
I'll be dead someday,
you know.

30
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:30,321
And I'm sure you'll still be
hanging around my office.

31
00:04:30,466 --> 00:04:33,527
*^ You're gonna miss me
when I'm gone... *^

32
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:35,695
Don't you start singing
that country music.

33
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:38,273
*^ You're gonna miss me
when I'm gone *^

34
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:41,973
*^ You're gonna
miss me... *^

35
00:04:42,112 --> 00:04:44,842
(via intercom)
*^ Do you ever want to kiss me...? *^

36
00:04:50,354 --> 00:04:52,322
Um...

37
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:55,550
I need to talk to you
about a problem I'm having.

38
00:04:57,528 --> 00:05:00,053
Is this temporal
or spiritual?

39
00:05:00,231 --> 00:05:01,721
Pardon?

40
00:05:01,866 --> 00:05:04,357
Are you here to talk with
your sheriff, or your bishop?

41
00:05:04,502 --> 00:05:06,368
Oh... my bishop.

42
00:05:06,505 --> 00:05:08,735
In that case,
could this wait until Sunday?

43
00:05:08,874 --> 00:05:10,466
I generally don't like to do
church business

44
00:05:10,609 --> 00:05:12,577
while I'm on the county clock.

45
00:05:12,711 --> 00:05:14,372
I'm sorry.

46
00:05:14,513 --> 00:05:16,208
Normally,
I wouldn't, but...

47
00:05:16,348 --> 00:05:19,146
I really need
to get this off my chest.

48
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:24,546
All right.

49
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,989
Um...

50
00:05:29,128 --> 00:05:31,028
Would you mind...

51
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:32,995
I've never had
to confess my sins

52
00:05:33,132 --> 00:05:35,532
to a man wearing
a gun before.

53
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:38,330
Oh.

54
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:41,508
Sorry.

55
00:05:47,081 --> 00:05:49,481
Thanks, Judy.

56
00:05:53,987 --> 00:05:56,547
Peg: Just got a call from
the development.

57
00:05:56,724 --> 00:05:58,158
A couple of boys
are mixing it up.

58
00:05:58,326 --> 00:06:00,055
- I'll go.
- No, you won't.

59
00:06:00,228 --> 00:06:01,889
You're not
an officer anymore.

60
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:04,055
Yeah, well, I could be
if you'd deputize me.

61
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:06,463
- I'm not going to do it.
- What am I supposed to do,

62
00:06:06,601 --> 00:06:08,831
just take out the trash
and sweep the floor?

63
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:10,835
Just be retired,
for crying out loud.

64
00:06:10,972 --> 00:06:12,872
Peg: Why don't you go home
and do some crossword puzzles?

65
00:06:13,007 --> 00:06:15,533
Maybe you should take up golf.
I hear old people enjoy that.

66
00:06:15,678 --> 00:06:17,543
Maybe you should all go
straight to hell.

67
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,649
I got 1 5, maybe 20
good years left.

68
00:06:20,783 --> 00:06:23,809
I'll outlive
all of you birds, anyway.

69
00:06:23,953 --> 00:06:26,945
That may be, but you're
still not going out.

70
00:06:27,123 --> 00:06:29,557
I can out-ride you.
I can out-shoot you.

71
00:06:29,725 --> 00:06:31,751
We don't ride anymore, Stu,
we drive.

72
00:06:31,928 --> 00:06:33,520
Wes, your gun.

73
00:06:34,965 --> 00:06:36,227
Oh.

74
00:06:36,366 --> 00:06:39,733
That's all right, I'll just stay here
with old Peg, then.

75
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:41,462
Old Peg?

76
00:06:41,605 --> 00:06:43,470
Prettier than
either one of you.

77
00:06:43,607 --> 00:06:45,666
Why don't you just
take him with you?

78
00:06:45,809 --> 00:06:47,937
Peg's practically married, Stu,
and don't you forget it.

79
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:50,445
That's right.
Maggie's looking down on you.

80
00:06:50,581 --> 00:06:53,675
Maggie's probably got better things
to do than look down on me.

81
00:06:56,287 --> 00:06:58,847
*^ You're gonna miss me
when I'm gone... *^

82
00:06:59,023 --> 00:07:00,888
Oh, good heavens.

83
00:07:01,025 --> 00:07:03,823
(country music playing)

84
00:07:04,963 --> 00:07:06,828
- (news radio playing)
- Terry, I don't want...

85
00:07:06,965 --> 00:07:08,091
to listen to the news.

86
00:07:08,233 --> 00:07:12,067
That's the real world going on
out there. The outside world.

87
00:07:12,204 --> 00:07:14,729
What makes you think I don't know
what's going on out there?

88
00:07:14,873 --> 00:07:17,535
I'm sick of it.

89
00:07:17,676 --> 00:07:19,940
Murderers, rapists,
robbers...

90
00:07:20,078 --> 00:07:22,912
kids with guns... it's the same story
over and over again.

91
00:07:23,049 --> 00:07:24,914
I'm tired of it.

92
00:07:25,051 --> 00:07:27,212
You will be, too,
by the time you're my age.

93
00:07:27,353 --> 00:07:28,752
(chuckles)

94
00:07:28,888 --> 00:07:31,584
Your age?
You talk like you're older than Stu.

95
00:07:33,259 --> 00:07:35,124
You just can't pretend
it all doesn't happen.

96
00:07:35,261 --> 00:07:37,388
- That's all I'm saying.
- It doesn't happen.

97
00:07:37,564 --> 00:07:39,032
Not here.

98
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,634
Here's all I care about.

99
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:44,465
(country music playing)

100
00:07:44,605 --> 00:07:47,870
There's something
worth listening to.

101
00:07:48,008 --> 00:07:50,875
Country music...
now that's a crime.

102
00:07:51,011 --> 00:07:53,206
That's scary stuff, Wes.

103
00:07:55,115 --> 00:07:58,381
You're an old man,
you know that?

104
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,953
You're the youngest old man
I've ever known.

105
00:08:00,088 --> 00:08:04,684
*^ So I tell you
how I yearn for you... *^

106
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:07,920
- Wes: We got a call about a fight.
- Man: Oh, yeah.

107
00:08:08,096 --> 00:08:11,293
That didn't amount to much,
just guys blowing off some steam.

108
00:08:11,433 --> 00:08:13,163
Which ones?

109
00:08:13,302 --> 00:08:16,396
Come on, Wes. A few punches being
thrown, a few names being called.

110
00:08:16,539 --> 00:08:19,508
I stepped in and it was over
before it even got started.

111
00:08:19,642 --> 00:08:21,507
What were
they fighting about?

112
00:08:21,644 --> 00:08:25,307
A woman. And one guy called
another guy a spic,

113
00:08:25,448 --> 00:08:27,575
and before you know it,
the fists are flying.

114
00:08:27,717 --> 00:08:29,583
It's all
patched up then?

115
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,585
Yeah, no trouble at all.
Just like I said,

116
00:08:31,722 --> 00:08:33,587
it was over before
it even got started.

117
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:36,318
Will you look at this?!
I could see a church right there,

118
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:38,087
two more
off that way,

119
00:08:38,262 --> 00:08:40,355
and another one
going up over there!

120
00:08:40,531 --> 00:08:43,694
I've never seen so many churches
in all my life, man.

121
00:08:43,834 --> 00:08:46,895
- Is that one of them?
- That's one of them.

122
00:08:47,038 --> 00:08:49,768
I love this town!
Where I come from,

123
00:08:49,908 --> 00:08:52,934
we got taverns on every corner,
and whorehouses in-between, man!

124
00:08:53,077 --> 00:08:57,207
I'm glad you like it.
Now get to work.

125
00:08:57,348 --> 00:08:59,339
All right,
I think I will.

126
00:08:59,484 --> 00:09:01,349
If you ever finish that house
I just may let you buy it.

127
00:09:01,486 --> 00:09:03,785
Worker:
I might do that, I just might.

128
00:09:03,923 --> 00:09:05,652
Sure is
an extroverted type.

129
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:08,783
You don't want to arrest
a potential citizen?

130
00:09:08,928 --> 00:09:11,897
We don't want to discourage growth,
now do we, Sheriff?

131
00:09:12,064 --> 00:09:14,157
I wouldn't mind
slowing it down a bit.

132
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:15,994
You trying to put me
out of business?

133
00:09:16,168 --> 00:09:18,363
I'm just trying
to keep things reined in.

134
00:09:18,504 --> 00:09:20,598
All the construction
on the roads,

135
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:22,605
all your out-of-towners
coming in for work.

136
00:09:22,742 --> 00:09:24,937
Everything's torn up
from here to Salt Lake.

137
00:09:25,078 --> 00:09:28,343
Tell me, Bishop, how many men
in your ward are out of work?

138
00:09:28,481 --> 00:09:30,813
Only the ones
that want to be.

139
00:09:30,951 --> 00:09:33,146
That's right.
Prosperity.

140
00:09:33,286 --> 00:09:35,151
And it ain't going
to be this way forever.

141
00:09:35,288 --> 00:09:37,985
1 0 years ago, I was living
in a trailer park.

142
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:40,150
Let's enjoy this
while we got it.

143
00:09:40,294 --> 00:09:41,989
Growing pains,
that's all.

144
00:09:42,129 --> 00:09:44,962
That's right.
Can't stay young forever.

145
00:09:51,138 --> 00:09:53,834
Terry: How much money
do you think Ralph makes?

146
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:57,205
What, in a year?

147
00:09:58,914 --> 00:10:00,939
I don't know,
a couple hundred thousand.

148
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:04,280
Terry: We're cops.
What are we doing being cops?

149
00:10:04,419 --> 00:10:07,445
I got everything I need.

150
00:10:07,589 --> 00:10:09,887
Real estate keeps going up.

151
00:10:10,025 --> 00:10:12,551
I don't know if I'll ever be
able to buy anything.

152
00:10:14,831 --> 00:10:16,856
Terry, I'm paying you
as much as I can.

153
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,161
I know that, Wes.
Just...

154
00:10:19,335 --> 00:10:22,202
sometimes I think I ought to go
back to work for Ralph again,

155
00:10:22,338 --> 00:10:24,272
you know,
learn how he does it.

156
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,704
I got to start putting
money away for my kids,

157
00:10:26,843 --> 00:10:29,278
for their missions,
college.

158
00:10:37,488 --> 00:10:39,353
Sure do miss her.

159
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:45,688
She was the only one who'd
listen to my missionary stories.

160
00:10:51,336 --> 00:10:53,270
You want a minute?

161
00:10:53,405 --> 00:10:55,396
Yeah.

162
00:10:55,573 --> 00:10:57,768
All right.

163
00:10:57,909 --> 00:10:59,604
Thanks.

164
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:44,621
Terry:
What's up?

165
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:47,922
Just some car.
I want to check this out.

166
00:12:05,881 --> 00:12:07,348
Whoa.

167
00:12:09,618 --> 00:12:11,712
Now that's a car.

168
00:12:25,101 --> 00:12:28,299
Pop that glove box...
see if you can find my ticket book.

169
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:12,941
(bird squawking)

170
00:13:56,465 --> 00:13:58,592
- (phone ringing)
- Sheriff's office.

171
00:13:58,734 --> 00:14:00,531
- I need you to do something.
- Shoot.

172
00:14:00,669 --> 00:14:04,036
Get Ryan Parker on the phone.
Have him meet me at the Evans homestead.

173
00:14:04,173 --> 00:14:06,971
Tell him to come right away.
We got a signal seven.

174
00:14:07,109 --> 00:14:08,873
- Okay. Will do.
- Give me the number...

175
00:14:09,012 --> 00:14:10,877
- For the FBI office in Salt Lake.
- Roger.

176
00:14:11,047 --> 00:14:11,877
Thanks.

177
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:15,984
What's a signal seven?

178
00:14:16,152 --> 00:14:17,744
What the heck
is a signal seven?

179
00:14:19,589 --> 00:14:21,022
That's a dead body.

180
00:14:36,807 --> 00:14:39,173
I need you to go into town
and get Ed Gray.

181
00:14:40,778 --> 00:14:42,713
We're going to need
his tow truck.

182
00:14:45,017 --> 00:14:47,884
Look what
they did to her.

183
00:14:50,122 --> 00:14:52,920
They didn't have
to leave her like that.

184
00:15:18,519 --> 00:15:20,384
(flies buzzing)

185
00:15:35,837 --> 00:15:37,862
(sirens wailing)

186
00:16:06,836 --> 00:16:09,362
- Are you Wes Clayton?
- Sheriff Clayton, yes.

187
00:16:09,506 --> 00:16:12,100
- Are you the one who found the body?
- Yes, I did.

188
00:16:12,242 --> 00:16:13,937
Agent #2: Have you identified
the victim?

189
00:16:14,077 --> 00:16:17,137
No, that's an out-of-state car.
That's why I called you in.

190
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:20,374
- Okay, great. Thanks.
- Agent #2: Don't go away.

191
00:16:20,517 --> 00:16:22,212
- Sheriff?
- Hey, chief.

192
00:16:22,352 --> 00:16:24,787
I never expected to make
a business trip to Brigham.

193
00:16:24,956 --> 00:16:25,888
Oh, I know it.

194
00:16:32,964 --> 00:16:34,829
(sirens wailing)

195
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:47,041
We can'tjust
let these guys in here.

196
00:16:47,179 --> 00:16:49,044
We got to finish
our investigation.

197
00:16:49,181 --> 00:16:50,546
We don't have
an investigation.

198
00:16:50,682 --> 00:16:52,206
- Is that all right?
- That's great. Thanks.

199
00:16:52,351 --> 00:16:54,785
That lady died in our town.
We got to take care of this.

200
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,387
We don't have to
take care of anything.

201
00:16:56,522 --> 00:16:58,047
This doesn't have anything
to do with our town.

202
00:16:58,224 --> 00:17:00,658
- What's going on?
- There's been a killing.

203
00:17:00,794 --> 00:17:03,354
- It's California plates.
- Terry: Wes...

204
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:05,896
That's an out-of-state vehicle.
We were just another exit ramp.

205
00:17:06,032 --> 00:17:07,932
It could have
happened anywhere.

206
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:09,865
This is right
in our own back yard.

207
00:17:10,003 --> 00:17:12,028
People don't even lock
their doors in our town.

208
00:17:12,172 --> 00:17:14,037
I don't want them to start.

209
00:17:14,174 --> 00:17:17,008
This doesn't have anything to do
with anybody in our town

210
00:17:17,144 --> 00:17:19,510
except you and me.
That's where I want it to stop.

211
00:17:19,647 --> 00:17:21,706
Do you understand me?
Do you understand me?!

212
00:17:21,849 --> 00:17:23,214
Yeah.

213
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:26,649
- Ed, do you understand?
- Yeah.

214
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:29,746
Terry, you're not even going
to talk to your wife about this.

215
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:33,190
If anybody asks us anything,
we're going to keep our mouths shut.

216
00:17:33,361 --> 00:17:35,056
- Peg knows, right?
- She knows.

217
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:37,528
I didn't sign up
just to walk kids across the street.

218
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:39,725
You signed up
to serve these people

219
00:17:39,901 --> 00:17:41,596
and to protect these people.

220
00:17:41,736 --> 00:17:44,432
And this kind of thing...
they don't want to know about it.

221
00:17:48,176 --> 00:17:51,044
Sheriff, has there ever been
a murder in this town?

222
00:17:53,449 --> 00:17:54,643
Never.

223
00:18:03,993 --> 00:18:06,019
We'll do the autopsy
in Provo.

224
00:18:06,196 --> 00:18:09,359
She'll be there a few more days,
if you want another look at her.

225
00:18:09,533 --> 00:18:11,228
Great.
Thanks, Ryan.

226
00:18:11,368 --> 00:18:14,098
We're not stepping
on any toes, are we?

227
00:18:14,238 --> 00:18:16,763
Apparently, I'm taking orders
from those two today.

228
00:18:16,907 --> 00:18:18,602
It's all right.
It's fine.

229
00:18:18,742 --> 00:18:20,437
Just take her.
Get her out of here.

230
00:18:20,577 --> 00:18:22,545
All right then.

231
00:18:26,818 --> 00:18:28,012
Hey, Ryan.

232
00:18:28,153 --> 00:18:32,055
I'd appreciate it if the reporters
didn't get a hold of this.

233
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:34,249
- I'm not going to make
- If anybody calls...

234
00:18:34,392 --> 00:18:36,087
If anybody calls,
I'll refer them to you.

235
00:18:36,227 --> 00:18:37,694
Thanks.

236
00:18:37,829 --> 00:18:39,991
Don't let those Feds
bully you around, Wes.

237
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:42,930
If I were you,
I'd keep my nose in this one.

238
00:18:43,068 --> 00:18:44,933
(engine starts)

239
00:18:55,147 --> 00:18:57,173
I think we have
everything we need here.

240
00:18:57,317 --> 00:18:59,808
Do you guys mind waiting
for the tow truck to finish?

241
00:18:59,953 --> 00:19:01,318
I'll stay.

242
00:19:01,454 --> 00:19:03,979
Give us a call if there's
anything else we need to know.

243
00:19:06,026 --> 00:19:09,587
Don't be surprised if you see us
around town the next few days.

244
00:19:09,729 --> 00:19:12,755
Listen, I'd rather
you left that part to me.

245
00:19:12,933 --> 00:19:15,835
Don't worry, Sheriff.
We'll keep a low profile.

246
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:18,768
All right.

247
00:19:34,489 --> 00:19:37,049
You want me to bring some food?
Hot chocolate or something?

248
00:19:40,128 --> 00:19:42,892
I'm just going
to wait for Ed.

249
00:19:43,031 --> 00:19:44,794
He can give me a ride home
in the tow truck.

250
00:19:44,967 --> 00:19:46,662
All right.

251
00:19:57,847 --> 00:19:59,712
Something finally happens
around here...

252
00:19:59,849 --> 00:20:02,079
you just pretend
it never did.

253
00:20:08,592 --> 00:20:12,028
It'll all be over,
as soon as that car leaves town.

254
00:20:13,297 --> 00:20:14,992
(engine starts)

255
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:27,501
(marching band playing)

256
00:20:52,204 --> 00:20:54,195
(crowd cheering)

257
00:20:55,842 --> 00:20:58,276
So it is
with great honor,

258
00:20:58,412 --> 00:21:00,573
we have
gathered here today

259
00:21:00,714 --> 00:21:02,875
to celebrate
one more year,

260
00:21:03,016 --> 00:21:04,984
and to wish
our beautiful little city

261
00:21:05,118 --> 00:21:06,745
Happy Birthday,

262
00:21:06,887 --> 00:21:10,983
on this, the 1 38th anniversary
of its founding.

263
00:21:11,124 --> 00:21:12,490
(beeps)

264
00:21:12,627 --> 00:21:15,687
We love you,
Little Brigham!

265
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:17,388
(mild applause)

266
00:21:30,245 --> 00:21:32,110
(wolf whistles)

267
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:39,954
Just be careful.
Watch where you're going.

268
00:21:40,089 --> 00:21:42,853
Okay, go, go.
Guys...!

269
00:21:42,991 --> 00:21:44,720
Kilo Two,
this is Dispatch.

270
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:47,421
Could you make sure
you look where you're going?

271
00:21:47,564 --> 00:21:50,294
Peg on radio:
Terry, are you there?

272
00:21:50,433 --> 00:21:51,491
Terry!

273
00:21:51,634 --> 00:21:53,158
This is Kilo Two,
go ahead.

274
00:21:53,303 --> 00:21:54,668
I'm getting calls
about an overflowing

275
00:21:54,804 --> 00:21:57,329
irrigation ditch on 600 North.

276
00:21:57,474 --> 00:22:00,102
What do you want me
to do about it? I'm busy.

277
00:22:00,276 --> 00:22:02,107
I told them we'd get
somebody over there.

278
00:22:02,245 --> 00:22:05,272
- Why can't they do it themselves?
- Because they're helpless.

279
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:08,976
I can't do it.
Where's Stu?

280
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,578
(old car horn honks)

281
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:16,725
(cheering)

282
00:22:36,248 --> 00:22:39,150
Hey, boss.
You keeping this riot under control?

283
00:22:39,285 --> 00:22:41,082
We're trying.

284
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:43,711
Have there been
any developments on that...

285
00:22:43,856 --> 00:22:45,551
No.

286
00:22:45,691 --> 00:22:48,125
You're coming
to my baptism aren't you?

287
00:22:48,261 --> 00:22:50,161
I wouldn't miss it.
You know that.

288
00:22:50,296 --> 00:22:51,627
(chuckles)

289
00:22:51,764 --> 00:22:53,391
Excuse me.

290
00:23:13,788 --> 00:23:15,688
Steve, I need you
to do me a favor.

291
00:23:15,824 --> 00:23:17,985
Sure,
anything you need.

292
00:23:18,126 --> 00:23:20,492
Are you still
developing your own film?

293
00:23:20,628 --> 00:23:21,993
Mm-hmm.

294
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:23,722
I need you to develop
these for me.

295
00:23:23,865 --> 00:23:25,833
Take that to one of those
quickie stops.

296
00:23:25,967 --> 00:23:29,096
- They can open it right up.
- No, I can't take it anywhere.

297
00:23:29,238 --> 00:23:30,728
I need you to develop these,

298
00:23:30,873 --> 00:23:34,240
then I need you to bring the prints
back to me... directly to me.

299
00:23:34,376 --> 00:23:36,776
You're not to talk about
what you see in here.

300
00:23:36,912 --> 00:23:39,608
All right.

301
00:23:42,351 --> 00:23:44,376
Excuse me.

302
00:23:54,297 --> 00:23:57,232
You think you two could be
any more conspicuous?

303
00:23:57,367 --> 00:23:59,460
Sheriff.

304
00:23:59,603 --> 00:24:01,298
You're sticking out
like a couple of sore thumbs.

305
00:24:04,642 --> 00:24:07,133
Oh, that's
much better.

306
00:24:07,278 --> 00:24:09,872
Thanks.

307
00:24:10,014 --> 00:24:13,381
We've gotten a call on that,
but we're pretty busy with the parade.

308
00:24:14,819 --> 00:24:16,946
I understand that.

309
00:24:17,121 --> 00:24:19,522
Yes, definitely.

310
00:24:19,658 --> 00:24:23,185
I'm sure you will.
Okay. All right.

311
00:24:23,328 --> 00:24:25,193
Let's go get
some cotton candy.

312
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:27,628
Excuse me.
Goodbye to you, too.

313
00:24:27,766 --> 00:24:30,394
- You're missing all the fun.
- You want to answer the phone?

314
00:24:30,536 --> 00:24:32,197
- No.
- (phone rings)

315
00:24:32,337 --> 00:24:34,601
I didn't think so.
Sheriff's office, this is Peg.

316
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:36,333
Yes.

317
00:24:36,476 --> 00:24:38,137
Yes, ma'am, we've already
gotten a call on that.

318
00:24:38,278 --> 00:24:40,041
It was the head trauma
that killed her.

319
00:24:40,179 --> 00:24:41,703
I'm sure you picked up
on that.

320
00:24:41,848 --> 00:24:43,577
It was kind of hard to miss.

321
00:24:43,716 --> 00:24:46,241
We pulled debris samples
from underneath her fingernails.

322
00:24:46,419 --> 00:24:48,819
- Maybe she scratched them.
- We pulled debris and fibers

323
00:24:48,955 --> 00:24:52,619
from her clothes, from the car,
we got hair, blood samples.

324
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:55,752
Hopefully the mess
wasn't all hers.

325
00:24:57,064 --> 00:24:59,294
- Was she raped?
- No.

326
00:24:59,433 --> 00:25:01,128
And it doesn't look
like a robbery.

327
00:25:01,268 --> 00:25:03,168
We are checking
the interstate records

328
00:25:03,304 --> 00:25:05,101
to find anything that looks
familiar to anybody,

329
00:25:05,239 --> 00:25:06,934
but so far, no luck.

330
00:25:07,074 --> 00:25:09,338
But it is the weekend.

331
00:25:09,476 --> 00:25:12,173
Listen,
I've got a deputy...

332
00:25:12,314 --> 00:25:14,839
who's eager
to help out on this one.

333
00:25:14,983 --> 00:25:16,883
I could lend him to you,

334
00:25:17,018 --> 00:25:19,043
if it would help
speed things up.

335
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:22,553
- No. Thanks.
- Agent #2: Relax, Sheriff.

336
00:25:22,691 --> 00:25:24,955
This woman's only been dead
for a day and a half.

337
00:25:25,093 --> 00:25:27,392
It's not like her blood's crying out
for vengeance just yet.

338
00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:29,589
Are you Mormon?

339
00:25:29,732 --> 00:25:31,290
Sure.

340
00:25:31,434 --> 00:25:33,732
- Jack Mormon.
- So I'm taking a little sabbatical.

341
00:25:40,276 --> 00:25:42,767
"Protect and serve,"
my eye.

342
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:45,381
Why don't you help me
shovel some of this crap?

343
00:25:45,515 --> 00:25:47,176
Did you say
something to me?

344
00:25:47,317 --> 00:25:49,512
This hearing aid's giving me
a piece of hell tonight.

345
00:25:54,658 --> 00:25:56,148
Hey!

346
00:25:56,326 --> 00:25:59,261
You want to watch where
you're flinging that stuff?

347
00:26:25,758 --> 00:26:27,783
All is well.

348
00:26:29,762 --> 00:26:32,822
Yes, yes it is.

349
00:26:35,568 --> 00:26:37,695
All is well.

350
00:27:00,027 --> 00:27:01,517
(church congregation singing)

351
00:27:05,499 --> 00:27:08,230
*^ Shout praises *^

352
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:11,168
*^ To our God and King *^

353
00:27:11,306 --> 00:27:15,003
*^ Above the rest *^

354
00:27:15,143 --> 00:27:19,011
*^ His words will tell *^

355
00:27:19,147 --> 00:27:22,480
*^ All is well *^

356
00:27:22,617 --> 00:27:26,577
*^ All is well. *^

357
00:27:36,065 --> 00:27:37,965
Woman:
Heavenly Father,

358
00:27:38,101 --> 00:27:40,968
we thank Thee for this
beautiful Sabbath morning.

359
00:27:41,104 --> 00:27:43,630
And we ask for Thy spirit
to be with the speakers today

360
00:27:43,774 --> 00:27:46,174
that they will be able
to communicate Thy word

361
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:48,175
and Thy will to us.

362
00:27:48,312 --> 00:27:51,110
And we ask that Thou
will continue to watch over us

363
00:27:51,248 --> 00:27:53,944
and to bless us
and to care for us.

364
00:27:54,084 --> 00:27:57,315
In the name of the Savior,
Jesus Christ, amen.

365
00:27:57,454 --> 00:27:59,320
All: Amen.

366
00:28:05,029 --> 00:28:08,123
We have some ward business
to take care of at this time.

367
00:28:08,299 --> 00:28:10,529
I'm sad to report

368
00:28:10,668 --> 00:28:12,329
that the Markham family
will be moving...

369
00:28:13,471 --> 00:28:16,134
- Three blocks east.
- (laughing)

370
00:28:16,275 --> 00:28:17,742
So they'll still be
in our ward.

371
00:28:17,877 --> 00:28:20,778
and they would appreciate it
if as many of us, as can,

372
00:28:20,913 --> 00:28:23,711
would help them move
into their new place Friday.

373
00:28:23,849 --> 00:28:25,817
So, let's all try to get out
and help them.

374
00:28:27,286 --> 00:28:28,810
Also...

375
00:28:28,954 --> 00:28:31,081
Sister Judy Perkins,
will you please stand?

376
00:28:33,126 --> 00:28:35,617
At this time, we'd like
to release Sister Perkins

377
00:28:35,762 --> 00:28:38,356
from her calling as a teacher
in the Relief Society.

378
00:28:38,498 --> 00:28:41,262
All of those who, along with me,
would like to express

379
00:28:41,434 --> 00:28:44,267
their gratitude for the many
hours of service,

380
00:28:44,404 --> 00:28:46,929
please make it manifest
with the uplifted hand.

381
00:28:49,944 --> 00:28:51,468
Thanks, Judy.

382
00:28:52,947 --> 00:28:55,313
And now we will prepare
to partake of the sacrament

383
00:28:55,449 --> 00:28:57,440
by signing
hymn number 193,

384
00:28:57,585 --> 00:28:58,984
"I Stand All Amazed,"

385
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,645
following which the sacrament
will be blessed and passed

386
00:29:01,789 --> 00:29:03,586
by the Aaronic Priesthood.

387
00:29:03,724 --> 00:29:05,715
(church organ playing)

388
00:29:13,669 --> 00:29:17,571
All:
*^ I stand all amazed *^

389
00:29:17,739 --> 00:29:24,202
*^ At the love
Jesus offers me... *^

390
00:29:24,347 --> 00:29:27,748
That they may witness unto Thee,
O God, the Eternal Father,

391
00:29:27,884 --> 00:29:29,943
that they do always
remember Him;

392
00:29:30,086 --> 00:29:32,077
that they may have
His spirit to be with them.

393
00:29:32,222 --> 00:29:34,122
- Amen.
- All: Amen.

394
00:30:59,647 --> 00:31:02,081
- Hey, Steve.
- Bishop.

395
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:06,551
Okay, there you go.

396
00:31:06,689 --> 00:31:09,487
Thanks.

397
00:31:09,625 --> 00:31:11,149
I'd say you're welcome,

398
00:31:11,293 --> 00:31:13,284
but it's really something
I'd rather not do again.

399
00:31:13,429 --> 00:31:16,125
I'm sorry
you had to see this.

400
00:31:16,265 --> 00:31:19,166
I don't suppose you can
say anything about that?

401
00:31:23,807 --> 00:31:26,469
You've kept my secrets.
I'll keep yours.

402
00:31:26,643 --> 00:31:28,304
You're a good man.

403
00:31:28,478 --> 00:31:31,174
Don't let it get out.
It'll ruin my reputation.

404
00:31:40,424 --> 00:31:43,882
Christ says we should be,
and I love how He puts this,

405
00:31:44,028 --> 00:31:46,519
"as wise as serpents,

406
00:31:46,664 --> 00:31:48,757
yet as harmless as doves."

407
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:51,731
What do you think
He means by that?

408
00:31:54,238 --> 00:31:56,365
Let's go
to another Scripture.

409
00:31:56,508 --> 00:31:59,966
Ah, Brother Hanks.

410
00:32:00,145 --> 00:32:02,943
I think He was saying...

411
00:32:03,081 --> 00:32:06,414
It's like if you have to go
to a used car lot...

412
00:32:06,551 --> 00:32:10,214
you got to know all the different
ways that the guy can rip you off.

413
00:32:10,355 --> 00:32:12,118
No offense, John.

414
00:32:12,257 --> 00:32:16,194
I mean, you can't be gullible.

415
00:32:16,329 --> 00:32:19,958
You have to know all
the different ways you can get hurt.

416
00:32:20,099 --> 00:32:22,795
But how does that fit in
with something else that Jesus said?

417
00:32:22,935 --> 00:32:25,733
We're supposed to be
like little children, right?

418
00:32:25,872 --> 00:32:29,103
Christ says, unless we're
like little children,

419
00:32:29,242 --> 00:32:32,076
we will not enter
the Kingdom of God.

420
00:32:32,212 --> 00:32:35,648
And children are totally innocent.

421
00:32:35,783 --> 00:32:37,876
They're gullible.

422
00:32:38,052 --> 00:32:42,318
Do we have to lose
our innocence to gain wisdom?

423
00:32:47,027 --> 00:32:48,893
(children laughing)

424
00:32:51,599 --> 00:32:54,796
Christ was wise,
but He was sinless.

425
00:32:54,936 --> 00:32:57,063
True, but what about
Adam and Eve?

426
00:32:57,205 --> 00:32:59,935
They were sinless...
well, for awhile.

427
00:33:00,075 --> 00:33:02,043
(laughter)

428
00:33:02,177 --> 00:33:04,042
But were they wise?

429
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:06,478
Let's go to another Scripture.
Book of Mormon,

430
00:33:06,649 --> 00:33:09,447
second Nephi,
Chapter Il,

431
00:33:09,585 --> 00:33:11,985
Verses 22 to 25.

432
00:33:12,121 --> 00:33:14,021
Do I have a volunteer?

433
00:33:15,591 --> 00:33:18,321
I'm sorry, sister,
I don't know your name.

434
00:33:21,298 --> 00:33:23,425
Meredith... Cole.

435
00:33:23,567 --> 00:33:27,128
Sister Cole, would you like
to read that for us?

436
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:30,068
I'm sorry.
I'm not a Mormon.

437
00:33:30,207 --> 00:33:32,198
I'm just observing.

438
00:33:32,342 --> 00:33:34,902
Oh, good.
Welcome.

439
00:33:35,045 --> 00:33:37,036
Thank you.

440
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:39,945
You can read,
can't you?

441
00:33:40,118 --> 00:33:42,086
Yes, I can.

442
00:33:42,253 --> 00:33:45,154
Would you mind
reading that for us?

443
00:33:48,893 --> 00:33:50,622
Sure.

444
00:33:54,665 --> 00:33:56,964
"If Adam had not
transgressed,

445
00:33:57,102 --> 00:33:59,002
he would not
have fallen."

446
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:06,237
(whimpering)

447
00:34:06,378 --> 00:34:08,744
What are you after?

448
00:34:08,881 --> 00:34:10,314
(dog barks)

449
00:34:13,753 --> 00:34:15,186
Go on,
get out of here!

450
00:34:15,355 --> 00:34:17,220
Get!
Get out of here!

451
00:34:17,357 --> 00:34:19,917
Get out of here!
Get!

452
00:34:30,404 --> 00:34:33,134
- Is the sheriff in there?
- I think he's at a meeting.

453
00:34:33,274 --> 00:34:35,401
Sheriff!

454
00:34:50,125 --> 00:34:51,683
Sheriff?

455
00:35:10,279 --> 00:35:11,803
(knocking on door)

456
00:35:16,786 --> 00:35:19,779
Hey, Bishop!
What brings you our way?

457
00:35:19,957 --> 00:35:21,424
Hi, Evelyn.
Do you mind if I come in?

458
00:35:21,592 --> 00:35:25,460
Mind? We've been
inviting you over for six months.

459
00:35:25,596 --> 00:35:27,894
- Come on in.
- Thanks.

460
00:35:28,031 --> 00:35:29,965
Can I talk you
into staying for dinner?

461
00:35:30,133 --> 00:35:32,863
- No, no, I can't.
- Oh. Ernie?

462
00:35:33,003 --> 00:35:35,130
Come on in.
Carolyn will be home any minute.

463
00:35:35,272 --> 00:35:37,867
She was off and gone before
we even got up this morning.

464
00:35:38,009 --> 00:35:40,534
- Hey there, Bishop.
- Hey, Ernie.

465
00:35:40,678 --> 00:35:42,669
- You staying for dinner?
- No, I can't.

466
00:35:42,814 --> 00:35:44,281
Sit down,
sit down.

467
00:35:51,489 --> 00:35:53,354
Sit down.

468
00:35:56,262 --> 00:35:58,127
Evelyn:
So, what's on your mind?

469
00:35:58,264 --> 00:36:00,095
What can we do
for you, Wes?

470
00:36:04,436 --> 00:36:06,563
It's about Carolyn.

471
00:36:10,442 --> 00:36:12,308
(phone rings)

472
00:36:15,081 --> 00:36:16,946
- Excuse me.
- Ernie, no!

473
00:36:17,083 --> 00:36:18,948
I'll just be
a minute.

474
00:36:23,323 --> 00:36:24,847
Hello?

475
00:36:24,991 --> 00:36:27,586
- Can I get you something to drink?
- Yeah, this is Ernie.

476
00:36:27,762 --> 00:36:30,094
Hey, Linda.
Yeah, no...

477
00:36:30,231 --> 00:36:32,165
the Sheriff, he's right here.
Wes is here right now.

478
00:36:32,333 --> 00:36:34,597
Bishop? Can I get you
a cold drink or something?

479
00:36:37,972 --> 00:36:39,496
Uh-huh.

480
00:36:42,243 --> 00:36:46,237
Uh-huh...
are you sure?

481
00:36:46,381 --> 00:36:48,542
Are you sure it's her?

482
00:36:52,587 --> 00:36:55,147
(sobbing)

483
00:36:55,290 --> 00:36:58,953
Ernie: No... no.

484
00:36:59,094 --> 00:37:01,620
Thank you.

485
00:37:03,533 --> 00:37:05,899
Thank you.

486
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:15,701
(deep sobbing)

487
00:37:15,845 --> 00:37:18,906
(phone rings)

488
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:24,811
(phone rings)

489
00:37:24,955 --> 00:37:26,582
Ernie, no. No!

490
00:37:26,724 --> 00:37:28,692
My baby. Wes...

491
00:37:28,826 --> 00:37:30,817
- That's my baby!
- (phone rings)

492
00:37:39,671 --> 00:37:41,969
I'm sorry.

493
00:37:42,107 --> 00:37:44,268
(ringing continues)

494
00:37:46,578 --> 00:37:48,478
I'm so sorry.

495
00:37:48,613 --> 00:37:51,343
- (ringing continues)
- This is Sherry Cornell...

496
00:37:51,483 --> 00:37:53,452
reporting to you live
from Brigham, Utah,

497
00:37:53,586 --> 00:37:56,384
a once sleepy town,
put on the map tonight

498
00:37:56,522 --> 00:37:58,854
as the scene
of a grisly murder...

499
00:38:03,195 --> 00:38:05,220
(sobbing)

500
00:38:27,922 --> 00:38:30,083
Congratulations,
Sheriff.

501
00:38:30,224 --> 00:38:33,091
You've got
a serial killer in town.

502
00:38:59,087 --> 00:39:01,955
Stuart Udall, do you swear
to uphold the constitution

503
00:39:02,091 --> 00:39:03,649
of the State of Utah,

504
00:39:03,793 --> 00:39:06,159
the laws of Kirtland County
and the cities therein?

505
00:39:06,296 --> 00:39:08,457
Yes, sir, I do.

506
00:39:08,598 --> 00:39:10,998
Then I hereby deputize you.

507
00:39:11,134 --> 00:39:13,625
You now serve at the pleasure
of the sheriff.

508
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:28,509
Excuse me.
Is Wes Clayton here?

509
00:39:28,652 --> 00:39:31,018
- No.
- If you don't tell Wes I'm out here,

510
00:39:31,155 --> 00:39:33,419
I'm going to walk
into his office right now!

511
00:39:33,557 --> 00:39:35,048
- I wouldn't recommend it.
- Peg...

512
00:39:35,193 --> 00:39:37,491
I need to see you
for five minutes.

513
00:39:37,629 --> 00:39:39,324
I know that.
Give me a couple minutes.

514
00:39:39,464 --> 00:39:42,592
I need a couple thousand of these.
Shrink them and put two on a page.

515
00:39:42,734 --> 00:39:44,258
- All right.
- Can we have a word?

516
00:39:44,402 --> 00:39:47,394
No. Then get a hold of all
the Aaronic Priesthood boys in town.

517
00:39:47,572 --> 00:39:50,871
All of them. I want a copy of that
on every doorstep before dark.

518
00:39:51,010 --> 00:39:52,375
- Got it.
- Terry!

519
00:39:52,512 --> 00:39:54,036
- Wesley!
- Mayor!

520
00:39:54,213 --> 00:39:56,044
You're gonna have
to hold on a few minutes!

521
00:39:56,182 --> 00:39:58,480
- Are you the mayor?
- Yes I am. Who are you?

522
00:39:58,618 --> 00:40:01,178
My name is Jack.
Mind if I ask you a few questions?

523
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:03,584
I guess that
would be fine.

524
00:40:03,723 --> 00:40:06,214
It'll be all right.
It'll be fine.

525
00:40:08,195 --> 00:40:10,459
Wes: I need you and Terry
to knock on every door

526
00:40:10,597 --> 00:40:12,064
within two blocks
of the square.

527
00:40:12,199 --> 00:40:14,099
Let's notjust talk
to whoever answers the door.

528
00:40:14,234 --> 00:40:17,431
Talk to everybody who lives there,
anybody that was visiting yesterday,

529
00:40:17,571 --> 00:40:19,835
- Anybody who could've seen anything.
- Got it.

530
00:40:20,007 --> 00:40:22,498
- Let's get it done.
- Yes, sir.

531
00:40:26,381 --> 00:40:27,973
Sheriff.

532
00:40:28,116 --> 00:40:29,879
- You got a minute?
- No, I don't.

533
00:40:30,018 --> 00:40:31,918
I need your permission
to look at the files

534
00:40:32,053 --> 00:40:34,044
for anything that might help
the investigation.

535
00:40:34,188 --> 00:40:36,986
You can look at anything you want to,
just don't remove anything,

536
00:40:37,125 --> 00:40:39,150
and let me know what
you're making copies of.

537
00:40:39,294 --> 00:40:41,023
- Deal.
- You won't find anything.

538
00:40:41,162 --> 00:40:42,926
Everybody here dies
of natural causes.

539
00:40:43,065 --> 00:40:44,760
What about
Tamra Hillam?

540
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:46,424
Tammy Hillam?

541
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:48,332
I've heard her name
three times today.

542
00:40:48,470 --> 00:40:51,030
Well, for one thing,
she isn't dead.

543
00:40:51,173 --> 00:40:53,471
She took off during
her senior year of high school,

544
00:40:53,642 --> 00:40:56,133
A couple of years ago.
Big fight with her parents.

545
00:40:56,312 --> 00:40:59,874
She went off to be a movie star.
That's the last anybody heard of her.

546
00:41:00,050 --> 00:41:01,540
No postcards,
no e-mails?

547
00:41:01,718 --> 00:41:04,084
Nothing,
not even to her friends?

548
00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:10,120
Sheriff...
no postcards or anything?

549
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:13,593
Look, it's in her file.
Tell Peg to give you access.

550
00:41:14,731 --> 00:41:16,393
Thank you.

551
00:41:23,174 --> 00:41:24,869
(shutter clicks)

552
00:41:25,009 --> 00:41:27,409
(clicks)

553
00:41:34,052 --> 00:41:37,215
Reporter: ... a resident of Brigham,
Utah, who knew the second victim.

554
00:41:37,356 --> 00:41:40,382
- Is that true?
- Man: Yeah, that's true.

555
00:41:40,525 --> 00:41:43,187
I took her
to the junior prom last year.

556
00:41:43,328 --> 00:41:45,193
We were...

557
00:41:45,330 --> 00:41:47,525
you know,
we were very close.

558
00:41:50,003 --> 00:41:51,800
Everybody says
she was murdered.

559
00:41:51,938 --> 00:41:54,065
Yeah, there's
no doubt about it.

560
00:41:56,809 --> 00:41:58,504
Was she...

561
00:41:59,679 --> 00:42:02,045
was she violated?

562
00:42:02,215 --> 00:42:04,809
Yeah.

563
00:42:10,124 --> 00:42:11,648
Do you have any men
working for you

564
00:42:11,792 --> 00:42:14,022
that might be capable
of something like that?

565
00:42:14,161 --> 00:42:16,026
No, I don't.

566
00:42:16,163 --> 00:42:19,030
Most of your men
are outsiders.

567
00:42:19,166 --> 00:42:21,566
- They're migratory.
- Yes, they are.

568
00:42:21,702 --> 00:42:24,638
Maybe you don't know them
as well as you think you do.

569
00:42:24,773 --> 00:42:27,571
I know enough that I don't have any
of that kind working for me.

570
00:42:27,709 --> 00:42:30,041
How do you know that?

571
00:42:30,178 --> 00:42:31,907
The way I figure it is,

572
00:42:32,047 --> 00:42:34,515
a guy who does
something like this,

573
00:42:34,649 --> 00:42:36,549
kind of has
to work himself up to it.

574
00:42:36,685 --> 00:42:39,677
He has a record of some kind...

575
00:42:39,854 --> 00:42:42,722
a rape,
or assault,

576
00:42:42,858 --> 00:42:44,553
or some kind of violence.

577
00:42:44,694 --> 00:42:46,423
Hey, do you
remember that kid...

578
00:42:46,562 --> 00:42:48,826
that kid who broke into
my office several years ago?

579
00:42:48,964 --> 00:42:50,932
- Yeah, we got him.
- Yeah we did.

580
00:42:51,067 --> 00:42:54,525
I also found out that kid had
a history of that kind of thing.

581
00:42:54,670 --> 00:42:56,900
It's my own fault.

582
00:42:57,039 --> 00:42:58,940
I never did any kind
of background check.

583
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:01,977
I took his application

584
00:43:02,112 --> 00:43:04,103
and I took his word.

585
00:43:04,247 --> 00:43:06,579
I deserved to get robbed.

586
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:09,378
And from then on,

587
00:43:09,553 --> 00:43:11,783
anybody that
works for my crew

588
00:43:11,922 --> 00:43:14,585
I know who they are
and where they come from.

589
00:43:14,726 --> 00:43:17,854
And I don't hire no man
with a shady history.

590
00:43:17,995 --> 00:43:21,761
Now that may not be
very Christ-like,

591
00:43:21,899 --> 00:43:23,924
but that's the way
I run my business,

592
00:43:24,068 --> 00:43:25,763
and that's how I know.

593
00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:41,180
No one really knows
what happened.

594
00:43:41,353 --> 00:43:43,480
It's just one
of those things.

595
00:43:43,655 --> 00:43:45,589
Freak accident,
you know?

596
00:43:49,028 --> 00:43:51,292
Wes can't remember
any of it.

597
00:43:53,333 --> 00:43:55,460
The best anyone
can figure,

598
00:43:55,602 --> 00:43:57,399
a truck,
or somebody,

599
00:43:57,537 --> 00:43:59,562
took a wide turn,

600
00:43:59,706 --> 00:44:01,765
he swerved
and went off the road...

601
00:44:01,908 --> 00:44:04,741
it was up in the canyon,
so if you go off the road,

602
00:44:04,878 --> 00:44:07,609
- You're in trouble.
- Nobody stopped?

603
00:44:07,748 --> 00:44:09,272
Nobody reported it?

604
00:44:10,618 --> 00:44:12,552
Half the town
was out looking for him.

605
00:44:13,854 --> 00:44:16,015
He was supposed to perform
a wedding that night.

606
00:44:16,190 --> 00:44:19,125
Terry was the one
that finally found them.

607
00:44:20,961 --> 00:44:22,691
Reporter: Did she have any trouble
with drugs or alcohol?

608
00:44:22,831 --> 00:44:24,662
Mr. Merrill:
Absolutely not.

609
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:27,200
Do you know anybody who could have
done something like this?

610
00:44:27,335 --> 00:44:30,304
No, we don't know anybody
that could have done something so...

611
00:44:30,438 --> 00:44:33,100
horrendous as this.

612
00:44:33,241 --> 00:44:35,869
Reporter: What's the last thing
your daughter said to you?

613
00:44:39,315 --> 00:44:41,749
She must have said something.

614
00:44:43,553 --> 00:44:45,418
Richie died instantly.

615
00:44:46,923 --> 00:44:49,391
Sarah, too, probably.

616
00:44:49,559 --> 00:44:51,823
Her neck was broken.

617
00:44:51,961 --> 00:44:54,452
And Wes...

618
00:44:54,630 --> 00:44:58,032
Wes was in a coma
for eight days.

619
00:44:59,436 --> 00:45:01,461
He told me once
that that was

620
00:45:01,605 --> 00:45:04,073
the worst part of it...

621
00:45:04,208 --> 00:45:06,870
that he couldn't remember.

622
00:45:07,010 --> 00:45:10,741
He doesn't know
if it was his fault or not.

623
00:45:10,881 --> 00:45:12,439
He still wears
his wedding ring.

624
00:45:12,583 --> 00:45:16,179
They were
a beautiful family.

625
00:45:16,321 --> 00:45:19,449
And that boy...

626
00:45:19,591 --> 00:45:22,560
(softly)
that boy.

627
00:45:25,997 --> 00:45:28,488
That boy followed him
around like a shadow.

628
00:45:30,970 --> 00:45:34,406
The weird thing was...
(sighs)

629
00:45:34,540 --> 00:45:37,475
they held the funeral
without him.

630
00:45:39,712 --> 00:45:41,612
Nobody thought he was
going to make it.

631
00:46:03,637 --> 00:46:06,505
Yeah, that's where
they found her.

632
00:46:06,641 --> 00:46:08,370
- Right under there.
- I know where they found her.

633
00:46:08,509 --> 00:46:11,205
Ivan Jensen...
he was the one who found her.

634
00:46:11,345 --> 00:46:13,779
- I was asking...
- He told me that himself.

635
00:46:34,670 --> 00:46:37,070
- Boy: Are we all getting out?
- Mother: Yeah.

636
00:47:06,537 --> 00:47:08,869
- Sheriff.
- Mr. McKay.

637
00:47:09,006 --> 00:47:12,465
What can I do for you?
Beer?

638
00:47:13,712 --> 00:47:16,078
I need to ask you
to do me a favor.

639
00:47:16,214 --> 00:47:18,580
I didn't think we had
that kind of relationship.

640
00:47:20,185 --> 00:47:22,710
It's got something to do
with those murders in town?

641
00:47:22,854 --> 00:47:25,948
I think it would be
good for the...

642
00:47:26,091 --> 00:47:29,459
for the long-term health
of your little establishment

643
00:47:29,595 --> 00:47:31,859
if you helped me out
on this one.

644
00:47:31,998 --> 00:47:35,126
What's the magic word, Sheriff?

645
00:47:37,136 --> 00:47:38,626
Probation.

646
00:47:44,610 --> 00:47:47,102
- Girl: I want to be 20.
- Why do you want to be 20?

647
00:47:47,247 --> 00:47:48,839
'Cause then
I could drive.

648
00:47:48,982 --> 00:47:50,711
You can drive
when you're 1 6, sweetie.

649
00:47:50,851 --> 00:47:52,910
- I know.
- You can also date when you're 1 6.

650
00:47:54,154 --> 00:47:56,019
Do you want this
over here?

651
00:47:56,156 --> 00:47:57,919
Fingers out
of the food, please.

652
00:47:59,059 --> 00:48:01,186
Shall we pray?

653
00:48:03,197 --> 00:48:05,222
(whispers)
Very good. Okay.

654
00:48:09,370 --> 00:48:10,803
Dad...?

655
00:48:16,444 --> 00:48:18,309
Just a second,
sweetie.

656
00:48:49,245 --> 00:48:51,338
Good night,
Brother Jensen.

657
00:48:51,481 --> 00:48:53,643
Good night, boys.

658
00:50:30,619 --> 00:50:32,746
(truck beeping)

659
00:50:41,298 --> 00:50:43,459
You picked a heck
of a day to move.

660
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:46,125
- Thanks for coming by.
- My pleasure.

661
00:50:49,372 --> 00:50:52,103
(children's voices)

662
00:50:59,423 --> 00:51:01,323
You didn't have
to bring all this.

663
00:51:01,458 --> 00:51:03,153
You've got enough
to worry about.

664
00:51:03,293 --> 00:51:05,124
If we left it
to the men,

665
00:51:05,262 --> 00:51:07,196
- We'd be eating cold pizza and donuts.
- That's about right.

666
00:51:10,367 --> 00:51:12,699
Hey, thank you.

667
00:51:12,836 --> 00:51:16,169
Of course.
Anytime.

668
00:51:19,076 --> 00:51:20,805
Sometimes I look at them

669
00:51:20,944 --> 00:51:22,878
and I can't believe
they all came out of my body.

670
00:51:23,013 --> 00:51:25,038
Don't even talk
like that.

671
00:51:25,182 --> 00:51:27,082
Oh, I'm sorry.
I keep forgetting.

672
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:29,013
I'm trying to pretend
I have easy deliveries.

673
00:51:29,186 --> 00:51:30,847
Hi! What are you
doing here?

674
00:51:31,021 --> 00:51:33,785
- Hey, Terry.
- I had to see how my baby's doing.

675
00:51:33,924 --> 00:51:34,948
We're good.

676
00:51:35,125 --> 00:51:37,855
- (crying)
- It's okay!

677
00:51:37,995 --> 00:51:39,360
Terry: Hey!

678
00:51:46,003 --> 00:51:47,664
(laughing)

679
00:51:51,174 --> 00:51:53,142
Coming back for seconds,
eh, Bishop?

680
00:51:53,276 --> 00:51:57,337
Yeah, you caught me.

681
00:51:57,481 --> 00:52:00,416
I'm just teasing you.

682
00:52:00,550 --> 00:52:02,677
(playful growl)
Tickle here.

683
00:52:05,022 --> 00:52:08,082
Did Terry tell you we finally
chose a name for the baby?

684
00:52:08,258 --> 00:52:12,058
- No, he didn't say anything.
- It was his choice this time.

685
00:52:13,363 --> 00:52:17,527
I tried to talk him
out of it...

686
00:52:17,668 --> 00:52:20,068
but I suppose we're going
to be calling the baby Wes.

687
00:52:23,774 --> 00:52:25,708
That's a good name.

688
00:52:25,842 --> 00:52:27,969
Yeah, I thought
you'd like it.

689
00:52:57,674 --> 00:52:59,505
All right.
Go for it.

690
00:53:11,555 --> 00:53:13,750
You're not big on hunting,
are you, Wes?

691
00:53:13,890 --> 00:53:15,881
Nope.

692
00:53:16,059 --> 00:53:18,254
It might improve
your marksmanship.

693
00:53:19,396 --> 00:53:20,761
No offense.

694
00:53:22,566 --> 00:53:24,693
I went on a deer hunt once
with my brother, Alan,

695
00:53:24,835 --> 00:53:26,700
and a couple
of his friends.

696
00:53:26,837 --> 00:53:28,361
They were big hunters.

697
00:53:28,505 --> 00:53:30,666
I've already
told you this story.

698
00:53:30,807 --> 00:53:32,468
No, you haven't.

699
00:53:36,213 --> 00:53:38,579
Anyway, we went out all day
and didn't get anything.

700
00:53:38,715 --> 00:53:41,081
I must have been,
oh, 1 2...

701
00:53:41,251 --> 00:53:42,946
1 3 maybe.

702
00:53:47,457 --> 00:53:50,688
I didn't even see a deer. I started
shooting at anything that moved,

703
00:53:50,827 --> 00:53:52,886
and I scared up
this little jack rabbit

704
00:53:53,029 --> 00:53:55,691
and he took off.
I raised my rifle.

705
00:53:55,832 --> 00:53:58,596
I fired
and he went down.

706
00:54:00,370 --> 00:54:01,894
We all ran over there

707
00:54:02,038 --> 00:54:04,029
and he was still alive.

708
00:54:04,174 --> 00:54:05,698
He was still kicking.

709
00:54:08,111 --> 00:54:09,806
Alan said,

710
00:54:09,946 --> 00:54:11,937
"You better put him
out of his misery."

711
00:54:15,418 --> 00:54:17,579
So I put the end
of my rifle up...

712
00:54:17,754 --> 00:54:19,915
up to his head
and I pulled the trigger.

713
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:22,456
You know,
I had this strange feeling.

714
00:54:26,863 --> 00:54:28,854
I mean I liked it.

715
00:54:28,999 --> 00:54:30,523
You know?

716
00:54:30,667 --> 00:54:33,465
There was some part of me that
really liked killing that animal.

717
00:54:34,604 --> 00:54:37,198
I was like some part of me
coming up that I didn't like,

718
00:54:37,340 --> 00:54:39,501
so I went home
and I put the gun away

719
00:54:39,643 --> 00:54:41,508
and I never
went hunting again.

720
00:54:49,786 --> 00:54:51,720
You know, I hadn't
thought about it but...

721
00:54:53,456 --> 00:54:56,220
I haven't fired a weapon
at any living creature since then.

722
00:55:00,497 --> 00:55:01,794
Did you take it home?

723
00:55:04,034 --> 00:55:06,229
The rabbit.
Did you eat it?

724
00:55:08,171 --> 00:55:09,695
No.

725
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:11,637
No, we left it there...

726
00:55:13,009 --> 00:55:14,374
in the dirt.

727
00:55:14,477 --> 00:55:16,172
(gunshot)

728
00:55:21,251 --> 00:55:23,014
You know,
I think some men

729
00:55:23,186 --> 00:55:25,814
just have a taste for killing.

730
00:55:28,491 --> 00:55:30,618
I think they like it.

731
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:32,455
The guy we're looking for...

732
00:55:32,596 --> 00:55:34,063
do you think...

733
00:55:36,132 --> 00:55:37,997
do you think this guy
could ever be cured?

734
00:55:39,369 --> 00:55:41,667
Do you think he could...

735
00:55:41,805 --> 00:55:44,205
I don't know, repent?

736
00:55:45,709 --> 00:55:47,199
I don't know.

737
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:51,640
I have a hard time
imagining it.

738
00:55:52,749 --> 00:55:54,979
Well...

739
00:55:55,151 --> 00:55:56,846
I know one cure.

740
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:25,575
Terry:
Edward Conrad Gray,

741
00:56:25,715 --> 00:56:28,183
having been commissioned
of Jesus Christ,

742
00:56:28,351 --> 00:56:30,114
I baptize you

743
00:56:30,287 --> 00:56:33,381
in the name of the Father,
and of the Son,

744
00:56:33,556 --> 00:56:35,524
and of the Holy Ghost.

745
00:56:35,692 --> 00:56:38,126
- Amen.
- All: Amen.

746
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:07,181
We're all set up here.
You ready to go?

747
00:57:07,357 --> 00:57:09,552
Yeah, I'll be there
in a minute.

748
00:57:12,896 --> 00:57:14,761
It's not your fault,
you know.

749
00:57:17,334 --> 00:57:19,165
You're a good sheriff, Wes.

750
00:57:19,302 --> 00:57:21,429
Better than I ever was.

751
00:57:22,572 --> 00:57:24,267
That's not true
and you know it.

752
00:57:24,407 --> 00:57:26,102
It is true,
and you know it.

753
00:57:28,078 --> 00:57:29,773
That's a compliment.

754
00:57:31,848 --> 00:57:33,372
Thank you.

755
00:57:33,516 --> 00:57:35,416
You're welcome.

756
00:57:39,622 --> 00:57:41,783
Little places like this...

757
00:57:41,925 --> 00:57:44,621
our days are numbered,
you know?

758
00:57:46,129 --> 00:57:47,824
The rest of the world
won't let us be.

759
00:57:47,964 --> 00:57:50,728
They're going to drag us in,
whether we like it or not.

760
00:57:53,903 --> 00:57:56,064
See, what we got here is
a little paradise.

761
00:57:57,874 --> 00:58:00,707
And nothing attracts
a serpent like a paradise.

762
00:58:04,014 --> 00:58:05,709
Yeah.

763
00:58:10,487 --> 00:58:12,955
*^ I want to be a rock star
and travel really far *^

764
00:58:13,123 --> 00:58:14,988
*^ And buy me
a big expensive car *^

765
00:58:15,125 --> 00:58:17,719
*^ And make lots of money
and find me a honey *^

766
00:58:17,861 --> 00:58:20,022
*^ And live in a nice big house
where it's sunny *^

767
00:58:20,163 --> 00:58:22,028
*^ With a pool
and I'll be cool *^

768
00:58:22,165 --> 00:58:24,565
*^ I'll always have a gig
because I'll be big *^

769
00:58:24,701 --> 00:58:26,692
*^ Have parties and friends
and places to go *^

770
00:58:26,836 --> 00:58:29,066
*^ The only problem is
I buried the banjo. *^

771
00:58:31,908 --> 00:58:33,739
(audience cheering)

772
00:58:43,787 --> 00:58:45,584
All right,
you can look.

773
00:58:45,722 --> 00:58:47,553
How do I look?

774
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:49,180
What?

775
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:51,122
Oh, never mind.

776
00:58:51,261 --> 00:58:54,230
Peg, you don't have to do this.

777
00:58:54,364 --> 00:58:57,561
Are you kidding? This is great...
I get to go undercover.

778
00:58:57,700 --> 00:58:59,861
- You got your pencil?
- Mm-hmm.

779
00:59:02,439 --> 00:59:04,737
Well, there was
nowhere else to put it. Oww.

780
00:59:06,876 --> 00:59:10,073
*^ I play the banjo
I play the banjo... *^

781
00:59:13,450 --> 00:59:15,315
(country music playing)

782
00:59:25,695 --> 00:59:28,220
Did you boys order
these empty beer bottles?

783
00:59:28,364 --> 00:59:30,662
Yeah, right there.
Right over here.

784
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:32,665
These ones are
from table seven.

785
00:59:32,802 --> 00:59:34,997
And their names
are Glen,

786
00:59:35,138 --> 00:59:37,197
Dave, Danny...

787
00:59:37,340 --> 00:59:39,467
How we going to keep
all this straight?

788
00:59:39,609 --> 00:59:41,099
We don't have to.

789
00:59:41,244 --> 00:59:42,939
All we got to do
is run the prints.

790
00:59:43,079 --> 00:59:45,274
If there's a match,
we get a name and a photo.

791
00:59:45,415 --> 00:59:47,576
- And a rap sheet.
- That's right.

792
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:49,411
Who thought up
this scheme?

793
00:59:49,586 --> 00:59:52,020
I wish I could say
it was me.

794
00:59:52,188 --> 00:59:54,520
Wes.

795
00:59:54,657 --> 00:59:56,454
Son of a gun.

796
01:00:05,001 --> 01:00:07,162
- Do you want a smoke?
- No.

797
01:00:07,303 --> 01:00:09,203
I don't smoke...

798
01:00:09,339 --> 01:00:11,739
anymore.

799
01:00:11,875 --> 01:00:13,570
Okay.

800
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:19,307
Hey, Pete.

801
01:00:19,449 --> 01:00:21,417
Hey, Sheriff.
What are you doing here?

802
01:00:21,551 --> 01:00:23,519
Just keeping
my eye on the party.

803
01:00:23,686 --> 01:00:26,211
You still my bishop
or did they release you?

804
01:00:26,389 --> 01:00:27,856
I'm still your bishop.

805
01:00:28,024 --> 01:00:31,391
Well, I'm going to keep
an eye on you tonight.

806
01:00:31,528 --> 01:00:33,325
Likewise.

807
01:00:34,597 --> 01:00:36,292
Hey, hey.

808
01:00:36,432 --> 01:00:38,297
What can I do
for you boys?

809
01:00:38,434 --> 01:00:40,129
What's your name?

810
01:00:40,270 --> 01:00:42,067
Same as it was
five minutes ago.

811
01:00:42,205 --> 01:00:44,435
It's Peg,
you idiot.

812
01:00:44,574 --> 01:00:46,565
Well, Peg, how come
it is that...

813
01:00:46,709 --> 01:00:49,269
you don't have a name tag
like all the other girls here?

814
01:00:49,412 --> 01:00:52,040
- 'Cause I'm new.
- She's the new girl!

815
01:00:52,182 --> 01:00:54,275
- That's right.
- You know, that's, uh...

816
01:00:54,450 --> 01:00:55,747
that's kind of
a coincidence

817
01:00:55,919 --> 01:00:58,012
because I happen to be
looking for a new girl.

818
01:00:58,188 --> 01:00:59,985
Are you now?

819
01:01:02,725 --> 01:01:04,522
Okay, well,
what can I get for you?

820
01:01:04,661 --> 01:01:06,492
Give us another round, please.

821
01:01:06,629 --> 01:01:08,722
- Okay.
- And some food, you got any food?

822
01:01:08,865 --> 01:01:11,561
- Mm-hmm. We got food.
- All right, yeah, whatever.

823
01:01:11,701 --> 01:01:13,692
- Okay.
- Chicken wings.

824
01:01:13,836 --> 01:01:15,201
Anybody missing?

825
01:01:15,338 --> 01:01:17,203
Just about everybody
will roll in before last call.

826
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:19,035
Even the non-drinkers
will come in,

827
01:01:19,175 --> 01:01:21,166
shoot some pool,
chase some skirt.

828
01:01:24,214 --> 01:01:26,614
I haven't been asked out
on so many dates

829
01:01:26,749 --> 01:01:28,580
in all my life.

830
01:01:51,874 --> 01:01:54,741
Well, the truck's full
and so is the back of your car.

831
01:01:54,877 --> 01:01:57,072
How much are these guys
going to drink anyway?

832
01:01:59,549 --> 01:02:02,040
- Things are slowing down in there.
- Thank heavens!

833
01:02:02,218 --> 01:02:04,743
Terry, I need you to take Peg
back to the office.

834
01:02:04,921 --> 01:02:07,446
Peg, go ahead and start
dusting these bottles.

835
01:02:07,624 --> 01:02:08,989
Roger that.

836
01:02:09,125 --> 01:02:11,059
Stu, you stay
for another hour or so,

837
01:02:11,194 --> 01:02:13,128
then take this load
back to the office.

838
01:02:13,263 --> 01:02:16,027
- Can you stay awake that long?
- Sure, I can stay awake.

839
01:02:16,165 --> 01:02:17,860
All right.

840
01:02:18,001 --> 01:02:19,832
- Go to work, men.
- And woman.

841
01:02:21,804 --> 01:02:23,965
I think we're going
to get this guy.

842
01:02:41,357 --> 01:02:43,291
(tire bursts)

843
01:03:15,458 --> 01:03:17,050
Great.

844
01:03:45,855 --> 01:03:48,551
Whoa.
A little bright there, huh?

845
01:03:48,691 --> 01:03:50,181
Sorry.

846
01:03:52,228 --> 01:03:54,389
You need a hand?

847
01:03:54,530 --> 01:03:56,862
I think they gave me
the wrong tool.

848
01:03:56,999 --> 01:03:58,796
Yeah.
That happens.

849
01:04:00,370 --> 01:04:02,804
I got something
in the truck.

850
01:04:04,107 --> 01:04:05,904
Thanks.

851
01:04:57,760 --> 01:04:59,489
Give this a try?

852
01:05:28,558 --> 01:05:30,685
- Hey, Stu.
- James.

853
01:05:30,827 --> 01:05:32,761
You're up late.

854
01:05:32,895 --> 01:05:35,455
Well, you know what they say...
no rest for the wicked.

855
01:05:36,632 --> 01:05:38,793
Is this all for you?

856
01:05:38,935 --> 01:05:41,631
(mumbles)
Ah, give me a pack of...

857
01:05:41,771 --> 01:05:43,671
What was that?

858
01:05:43,806 --> 01:05:46,366
A pack of cigarettes, Jamie.

859
01:05:46,509 --> 01:05:48,739
Straights.
No filter.

860
01:05:48,878 --> 01:05:50,573
One pack.

861
01:05:50,713 --> 01:05:52,874
You want me to get you
a Playboy, too?

862
01:05:53,015 --> 01:05:55,916
I don't want a Playboy.
I want a pack of cigarettes.

863
01:05:56,085 --> 01:05:57,677
Okay?

864
01:05:57,854 --> 01:05:59,879
I'm not going
to give them to you.

865
01:06:00,056 --> 01:06:03,321
Well, you got them
there for sale.

866
01:06:03,459 --> 01:06:05,086
I'm the customer.

867
01:06:05,228 --> 01:06:07,753
You're either going to sell
them to me, or I'll go elsewhere

868
01:06:07,897 --> 01:06:09,797
and you suit yourself.

869
01:06:10,933 --> 01:06:13,458
Dog-gone things
are going to kill you.

870
01:06:13,603 --> 01:06:15,628
I think I'm going
to tell the bishop on you.

871
01:06:15,771 --> 01:06:17,136
You mind
your own business.

872
01:06:17,273 --> 01:06:19,764
I'll get around to telling
the bishop soon enough.

873
01:06:19,909 --> 01:06:21,342
I always do.

874
01:06:23,346 --> 01:06:25,871
- Thank you, very much.
- You're not very welcome.

875
01:06:53,776 --> 01:06:56,609
You just won't make it
easy for me, will you?

876
01:07:18,134 --> 01:07:20,329
Jamie?

877
01:07:21,470 --> 01:07:22,994
James?

878
01:07:29,979 --> 01:07:32,413
(muffled screaming)

879
01:08:22,298 --> 01:08:23,822
(gunshot)

880
01:08:28,537 --> 01:08:30,664
(police siren blaring)

881
01:08:46,789 --> 01:08:48,586
Sheriff, I'm sorry.

882
01:09:03,105 --> 01:09:05,073
Steve, let's give him
a minute.

883
01:09:42,812 --> 01:09:45,212
Bottles are still
in the back of the truck.

884
01:09:46,649 --> 01:09:48,617
I guess they didn't
notice he had them.

885
01:09:48,751 --> 01:09:51,686
Get them back to the office
as fast as you can.

886
01:09:51,821 --> 01:09:53,721
We don't have
any time to waste.

887
01:09:53,856 --> 01:09:56,347
Have you had enough
of the real world yet, Terry?

888
01:10:02,698 --> 01:10:04,666
(police radio chatter)

889
01:10:08,971 --> 01:10:10,495
Hey, Spence.

890
01:10:12,775 --> 01:10:14,606
Are you going
to find my sister?

891
01:10:16,746 --> 01:10:18,213
I'm going to find her.

892
01:10:19,715 --> 01:10:21,580
You say a few prayers
in the mean time though.

893
01:10:22,752 --> 01:10:25,448
- Okay.
- Okay.

894
01:10:27,523 --> 01:10:29,491
How many sets of prints
are we going to have?

895
01:10:29,658 --> 01:10:32,718
43 7 bottles, 43 7 prints.

896
01:10:32,862 --> 01:10:34,955
Some will be duplicates.

897
01:10:35,097 --> 01:10:35,995
Terry:
Triplicates.

898
01:10:37,166 --> 01:10:38,827
We're going
to be here all night.

899
01:10:38,968 --> 01:10:40,492
(knocking)

900
01:10:40,636 --> 01:10:43,104
- It's Ed.
- Yeah, let him in.

901
01:10:43,239 --> 01:10:46,106
If we find anything,
it's not admissible in court, is it?

902
01:10:46,242 --> 01:10:49,075
We're just trying
to identify some suspects.

903
01:10:49,211 --> 01:10:51,111
I just want to find Jamie.

904
01:10:52,248 --> 01:10:54,113
Do you think
she's still alive?

905
01:10:57,520 --> 01:11:00,080
- Hey.
- Hey, Ed.

906
01:11:00,256 --> 01:11:01,917
I heard about Stu.

907
01:11:03,559 --> 01:11:06,824
Yeah. This is Meredith Cole,
she's with the FBI.

908
01:11:06,962 --> 01:11:09,157
Oh. Hi.

909
01:11:09,298 --> 01:11:10,731
Nice to meet you.

910
01:11:12,001 --> 01:11:14,299
Is there anything
I can do to help?

911
01:11:14,436 --> 01:11:17,405
Why don't you grab some gloves.
Help Peg dust for prints.

912
01:11:17,540 --> 01:11:20,475
Really?
Dust for prints. Wow.

913
01:11:20,609 --> 01:11:23,271
It's not all that exciting,
believe me.

914
01:11:23,412 --> 01:11:24,401
Okay.

915
01:11:27,316 --> 01:11:28,943
We'll find her.

916
01:12:03,519 --> 01:12:05,043
First one's coming up.

917
01:12:14,763 --> 01:12:16,287
Peg:
Well, what do you know?

918
01:12:16,432 --> 01:12:19,299
I thought every man in that bar
had a record of some kind.

919
01:12:19,435 --> 01:12:21,369
We'll only flag
the violent ones.

920
01:12:21,503 --> 01:12:23,095
Sex offenders.

921
01:12:23,239 --> 01:12:25,469
Peg, I want you
to get on the phone.

922
01:12:25,608 --> 01:12:30,102
See how many men you can get
to meet me at the gazebo at 7:00 a.m.

923
01:12:30,246 --> 01:12:31,770
It's 2:30 in the morning.

924
01:12:31,914 --> 01:12:33,939
Doesn't give us much time.

925
01:12:34,083 --> 01:12:37,246
Okay. There's going to be a lot
of people hating me tonight.

926
01:12:37,419 --> 01:12:39,580
Just tell them Jamie Harlan's life
is on the line.

927
01:12:39,755 --> 01:12:41,746
You won't hear
much grumbling.

928
01:12:46,228 --> 01:12:47,923
(computer rings)

929
01:12:55,838 --> 01:12:58,170
You've got yourself
a nice town.

930
01:13:00,175 --> 01:13:02,075
Yeah.

931
01:13:02,211 --> 01:13:04,941
Yeah,
they're good people.

932
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:07,241
Where are you from?
You a Salt Lake girl?

933
01:13:07,383 --> 01:13:09,613
No.

934
01:13:09,785 --> 01:13:12,015
No,
I'm just passing through.

935
01:13:12,187 --> 01:13:13,848
Doing some training.

936
01:13:14,023 --> 01:13:16,253
A Jack Mormon.

937
01:13:18,961 --> 01:13:20,588
How's that going?

938
01:13:20,729 --> 01:13:22,856
Oh,
I'll whip him into shape.

939
01:13:27,369 --> 01:13:29,803
Actually,
I grew up in Manhattan.

940
01:13:29,939 --> 01:13:31,531
Have you ever been there?

941
01:13:34,076 --> 01:13:36,237
It's nice.

942
01:13:36,378 --> 01:13:39,176
- Different, I hear.
- Oh, yeah.

943
01:13:41,250 --> 01:13:43,115
Out here,
with all the empty space,

944
01:13:43,285 --> 01:13:45,753
it's kind of creepy.

945
01:13:46,989 --> 01:13:48,718
Creepy?

946
01:13:48,857 --> 01:13:50,757
- Really?
- Sure.

947
01:14:01,236 --> 01:14:03,170
You seem like
a pretty reasonable man.

948
01:14:04,840 --> 01:14:07,001
Intelligent.

949
01:14:07,142 --> 01:14:09,303
Down to earth.

950
01:14:09,445 --> 01:14:11,504
Okay.

951
01:14:11,647 --> 01:14:13,911
I've been reading
some of your books.

952
01:14:16,185 --> 01:14:17,914
Your...

953
01:14:18,087 --> 01:14:19,987
Scriptures.

954
01:14:21,290 --> 01:14:24,748
All this about
angels and prophets,

955
01:14:24,927 --> 01:14:27,020
Jesus talking
to people.

956
01:14:28,364 --> 01:14:30,525
Do you really
believe all that?

957
01:14:30,666 --> 01:14:32,998
Yes, I do.

958
01:14:37,673 --> 01:14:39,504
You're just
a little naive, that's all.

959
01:14:40,709 --> 01:14:42,074
Excuse me?

960
01:14:42,211 --> 01:14:44,202
I've heard it all my life.

961
01:14:46,415 --> 01:14:49,816
Because we don't want to experience
some of the things out there,

962
01:14:49,985 --> 01:14:52,510
some people think
we're naive.

963
01:14:54,189 --> 01:14:55,884
We have our own experiences.

964
01:14:57,526 --> 01:15:00,893
We get down on our knees
and we say our prayers

965
01:15:01,030 --> 01:15:04,329
and do our best to live
the way God wants us to live...

966
01:15:05,701 --> 01:15:07,862
and every now and again

967
01:15:08,003 --> 01:15:09,766
he gives us a...

968
01:15:09,905 --> 01:15:11,930
a little experience.

969
01:15:18,814 --> 01:15:20,975
I guess we're both naive

970
01:15:21,116 --> 01:15:23,744
to one extent or another.

971
01:15:24,920 --> 01:15:26,854
Just about different things.

972
01:15:51,680 --> 01:15:53,341
(clicks)

973
01:15:57,252 --> 01:15:58,617
(clicks)

974
01:16:06,995 --> 01:16:08,519
I drove by.

975
01:16:08,664 --> 01:16:10,359
Every cop in town
was there.

976
01:16:10,499 --> 01:16:12,194
We only got two cops.

977
01:16:12,334 --> 01:16:14,268
Yeah, and they were
both there.

978
01:16:29,051 --> 01:16:31,144
All right.
It's 7:00.

979
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:34,221
Meredith, can you take over
at the computer?

980
01:16:38,060 --> 01:16:39,584
Don't give up.

981
01:16:43,298 --> 01:16:45,163
- Wes: Ed.
- Hmm?

982
01:16:48,604 --> 01:16:51,164
Now how many of you men served
full-time missions for the church?

983
01:16:53,308 --> 01:16:55,037
Now what I'm going to ask
you to do

984
01:16:55,177 --> 01:16:57,236
is going to feel
just like the old days.

985
01:16:57,379 --> 01:16:59,142
I want you to pair off,
two by two.

986
01:16:59,281 --> 01:17:00,942
You're going to go
from house to house.

987
01:17:01,083 --> 01:17:02,812
You're going to knock
on every door.

988
01:17:02,985 --> 01:17:05,249
You're going to search
every home in town.

989
01:17:05,420 --> 01:17:07,854
Now I want you
to be nice about this.

990
01:17:07,990 --> 01:17:10,823
These people are
your neighbors.

991
01:17:10,959 --> 01:17:12,893
But I want you
to be thorough.

992
01:17:13,061 --> 01:17:15,393
- Mike?
- I have to be to work by 9:00.

993
01:17:15,531 --> 01:17:17,396
Nobody's going to work today.

994
01:17:17,533 --> 01:17:20,263
Jamie Harlan's life is more important
than any of yourjobs.

995
01:17:21,503 --> 01:17:24,336
You're going to look
in every closet and every corner,

996
01:17:24,473 --> 01:17:26,566
in every attic,
in every space

997
01:17:26,708 --> 01:17:28,608
that's large enough
to hold a human body.

998
01:17:28,744 --> 01:17:31,645
If anybody doesn't
let you search the house...

999
01:17:33,115 --> 01:17:35,675
one of you is going
to sit down on the front curb

1000
01:17:35,851 --> 01:17:38,217
and the other one's
going to come back here...

1001
01:17:38,353 --> 01:17:39,843
immediately.

1002
01:17:40,022 --> 01:17:42,456
Except
in that circumstance,

1003
01:17:42,624 --> 01:17:44,785
you will not separate.

1004
01:17:44,927 --> 01:17:47,555
If anybody decides
to take a 1 5-minute break,

1005
01:17:47,696 --> 01:17:49,755
I want to know about it.

1006
01:17:49,898 --> 01:17:52,799
I don't want anybody to have time
to hide or move anything.

1007
01:17:54,336 --> 01:17:56,099
Do you understand?

1008
01:17:56,238 --> 01:17:58,934
- Ivan.
- Does this mean we're all suspects?

1009
01:17:59,074 --> 01:18:00,405
Yes, it does.

1010
01:18:03,845 --> 01:18:05,437
- Ivan: Morning, Megan.
- Hi.

1011
01:18:05,581 --> 01:18:08,049
The sheriff's asked us
to go house to house in the town.

1012
01:18:08,183 --> 01:18:09,844
We're looking
for Jamie Harlan.

1013
01:18:33,342 --> 01:18:34,741
Yeah?

1014
01:18:34,876 --> 01:18:37,936
Morning Sister Peck. Me and Mike
have been asked by the sheriff

1015
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:40,071
to come search
the homes here in town.

1016
01:18:40,215 --> 01:18:43,343
We're hoping you won't mind if we
come inside and have a look around?

1017
01:18:43,518 --> 01:18:46,351
- You want to what?
- You heard that Jamie Harlan's missing?

1018
01:18:46,488 --> 01:18:48,149
We're searching
all the homes in town.

1019
01:18:49,491 --> 01:18:51,459
You're not coming
into my house.

1020
01:18:51,627 --> 01:18:53,322
You don't have a warrant.

1021
01:18:53,462 --> 01:18:56,158
- You're not even policemen.
- No, ma'am, we're not.

1022
01:18:56,298 --> 01:18:58,493
We're just out here
trying to do the right thing.

1023
01:18:58,634 --> 01:19:00,465
You're not coming
into my house.

1024
01:19:00,602 --> 01:19:02,763
Is Steve home?
Maybe we could talk to him.

1025
01:19:02,904 --> 01:19:04,565
No, he's not.

1026
01:19:06,475 --> 01:19:08,602
He's right...
this is like being missionaries.

1027
01:19:10,712 --> 01:19:13,340
I'll wait here at the curb
if you want to run into town.

1028
01:19:13,482 --> 01:19:15,109
I'm not
running anywhere.

1029
01:19:17,419 --> 01:19:18,886
Ben:
Here we go.

1030
01:19:25,193 --> 01:19:27,787
- She won't let you in?
- No, not an inch.

1031
01:19:29,631 --> 01:19:31,326
(doorbell rings)

1032
01:19:37,839 --> 01:19:41,104
Clara, this is Sheriff Clayton.
I want you to open up this door!

1033
01:19:45,647 --> 01:19:48,138
There's a young girl's life
at stake!

1034
01:19:48,283 --> 01:19:50,808
Either open up this door
or I'm going to break it down!

1035
01:19:52,688 --> 01:19:54,519
Clara!

1036
01:19:58,226 --> 01:20:00,023
You guys
stay right here.

1037
01:20:10,172 --> 01:20:11,867
Kilo One
to Kilo Two.

1038
01:20:24,553 --> 01:20:26,043
Terry?

1039
01:20:27,255 --> 01:20:29,280
- Come with me.
- What's going on?

1040
01:20:29,458 --> 01:20:31,153
You just
come with me.

1041
01:20:44,673 --> 01:20:46,038
Steve:
Bishop.

1042
01:20:47,142 --> 01:20:48,302
What's going on?

1043
01:20:48,443 --> 01:20:50,240
Your mother won't
let us search the house.

1044
01:20:52,214 --> 01:20:54,011
Well, you don't have
a warrant.

1045
01:20:57,619 --> 01:20:59,917
Do you really
want me to get one?

1046
01:21:06,194 --> 01:21:08,355
This isn't right.
This just isn't right.

1047
01:21:19,508 --> 01:21:21,169
You should be ashamed
of yourself!

1048
01:21:21,309 --> 01:21:23,277
Poking around
in my house!

1049
01:21:31,052 --> 01:21:32,781
- I'm going to sue this town!
- Mother!

1050
01:21:32,954 --> 01:21:35,354
I'm going to sue this town
for every penny its got!

1051
01:21:35,490 --> 01:21:37,185
Clara, stay back.

1052
01:21:44,466 --> 01:21:46,331
Check under the bed.

1053
01:21:52,808 --> 01:21:54,639
Steve, I want you
to let me in this closet.

1054
01:21:54,776 --> 01:21:57,108
- Bishop.
- Open this door.

1055
01:21:59,714 --> 01:22:01,545
No.

1056
01:22:01,683 --> 01:22:04,117
- What are you doing?!
- Clara, stay back!

1057
01:22:04,252 --> 01:22:06,049
- Get your hands off him!
- Get back!

1058
01:22:06,221 --> 01:22:07,711
Okay, Steve, this is
getting out of hand.

1059
01:22:07,889 --> 01:22:10,585
I want you to unlock this door
before somebody gets hurt!

1060
01:22:12,227 --> 01:22:13,592
Steve!

1061
01:22:17,165 --> 01:22:19,133
The key's
in the cup there.

1062
01:22:47,229 --> 01:22:49,094
(crying)

1063
01:23:37,479 --> 01:23:39,242
Let him go.

1064
01:23:52,227 --> 01:23:55,128
You have a darkroom
in the garage.

1065
01:23:57,599 --> 01:23:59,294
We're going
to need to see it.

1066
01:24:01,036 --> 01:24:02,560
Come on.

1067
01:24:14,115 --> 01:24:16,879
I kept meaning
to talk to you about...

1068
01:24:17,052 --> 01:24:19,987
I think I would die
if anyone knew.

1069
01:24:20,155 --> 01:24:21,816
Steve...

1070
01:24:21,990 --> 01:24:24,049
I need you to come back
with me to the station.

1071
01:24:24,225 --> 01:24:26,056
For questioning.

1072
01:24:27,195 --> 01:24:29,163
- Bishop...
- Don't...

1073
01:24:29,297 --> 01:24:31,788
Don't call me "Bishop."

1074
01:24:31,933 --> 01:24:34,333
Right now, I have to care
about the people in this town

1075
01:24:34,469 --> 01:24:36,130
a lot more than
I care about you.

1076
01:24:37,505 --> 01:24:39,439
Do you understand me?

1077
01:24:39,541 --> 01:24:41,475
I never hurt anybody.

1078
01:24:41,610 --> 01:24:43,544
Not anybody.

1079
01:24:57,759 --> 01:24:59,488
Mike:
What's going on, Bishop?

1080
01:25:13,475 --> 01:25:15,841
Go ahead and get these people
back to their houses.

1081
01:25:15,977 --> 01:25:18,172
It's all right.
There's nothing going on here.

1082
01:25:18,313 --> 01:25:21,407
This is the Peck's house.
Let's go, there's nothing wrong here.

1083
01:25:21,549 --> 01:25:23,346
Come on,
let's go.

1084
01:25:25,186 --> 01:25:26,881
There's nothing
wrong here.

1085
01:25:56,151 --> 01:25:58,244
Who's idea was
this fingerprint thing anyway?

1086
01:25:58,420 --> 01:26:00,388
Just shut up.

1087
01:26:47,068 --> 01:26:48,695
Peg.

1088
01:26:48,837 --> 01:26:50,236
Peg!

1089
01:26:51,473 --> 01:26:52,405
Yeah?

1090
01:26:52,540 --> 01:26:54,735
I need the files on
Lisa Colvin and Tammy Hillam.

1091
01:26:54,876 --> 01:26:57,868
Meredith had them out.
I'll find them.

1092
01:27:11,659 --> 01:27:13,786
All right,
here comes the last one.

1093
01:27:13,928 --> 01:27:16,089
Wes!
This had better be him.

1094
01:27:17,232 --> 01:27:18,790
Come on!

1095
01:27:27,809 --> 01:27:29,333
Son of a gun.

1096
01:27:34,649 --> 01:27:36,173
Peg:
I know him.

1097
01:27:36,351 --> 01:27:38,615
- Who is that?
- That's that construction guy.

1098
01:27:38,787 --> 01:27:40,277
Big guy.
I remember him.

1099
01:27:41,990 --> 01:27:43,787
Come on,
give me the rap sheet.

1100
01:27:49,464 --> 01:27:51,523
- Possession of marijuana.
- That's it?

1101
01:27:51,666 --> 01:27:53,429
You've got
to be kidding.

1102
01:27:59,174 --> 01:28:00,801
You get anything?

1103
01:28:00,942 --> 01:28:03,001
I don't think so.

1104
01:28:03,144 --> 01:28:06,079
- Now what?
- Now you go home and get some rest.

1105
01:28:07,348 --> 01:28:09,942
- Wes...
- Neither of you have slept in 48 hours.

1106
01:28:10,118 --> 01:28:12,279
I'm going to need
you fresh again tomorrow.

1107
01:28:12,453 --> 01:28:13,886
How long has it been for you?

1108
01:28:15,056 --> 01:28:16,489
I'll be fine.

1109
01:28:18,693 --> 01:28:21,389
It's all right. We've done
everything we can do for now.

1110
01:28:23,031 --> 01:28:25,192
Would it be okay
if we said a prayer?

1111
01:28:27,635 --> 01:28:29,125
Sure.

1112
01:28:33,241 --> 01:28:35,038
Peg:
Heavenly Father...

1113
01:28:36,678 --> 01:28:40,045
right now, we're kind of
at the end of our rope.

1114
01:28:40,181 --> 01:28:42,445
We're losing
some of our friends,

1115
01:28:42,584 --> 01:28:44,449
some of our family.

1116
01:28:44,619 --> 01:28:46,678
Everything's falling apart.

1117
01:28:48,289 --> 01:28:50,951
Nobody trusts anybody.

1118
01:28:51,092 --> 01:28:52,719
Everybody's afraid.

1119
01:28:54,662 --> 01:28:56,357
And we're just so tired.

1120
01:28:58,399 --> 01:29:00,333
Please...

1121
01:29:00,468 --> 01:29:02,766
help us find Jamie.

1122
01:29:02,904 --> 01:29:05,805
Please don't let her die.

1123
01:29:07,976 --> 01:29:10,206
Help us find
this man who...

1124
01:29:10,345 --> 01:29:12,575
keeps taking our friends.

1125
01:29:14,482 --> 01:29:16,245
And if we're just not...

1126
01:29:16,417 --> 01:29:18,715
smart enough, or...

1127
01:29:18,887 --> 01:29:20,548
strong enough to stop him...

1128
01:29:23,291 --> 01:29:25,316
then...

1129
01:29:25,493 --> 01:29:27,358
please take it
into Your hands.

1130
01:29:29,330 --> 01:29:30,957
Please...

1131
01:29:31,099 --> 01:29:32,623
please, Lord.

1132
01:29:33,768 --> 01:29:35,463
Please stop this man.

1133
01:29:36,671 --> 01:29:38,366
Please make him stop.

1134
01:29:45,780 --> 01:29:48,010
In the name
of Jesus Christ, amen.

1135
01:29:48,149 --> 01:29:50,379
- Amen.
- Amen.

1136
01:29:51,953 --> 01:29:53,818
Wes:
Thanks, Peg.

1137
01:30:01,696 --> 01:30:03,391
Here are the files.

1138
01:30:04,532 --> 01:30:06,329
Thanks.
Hey, Peg.

1139
01:30:08,736 --> 01:30:11,000
You knew her, right?
Tammy Hillam.

1140
01:30:11,139 --> 01:30:13,130
Before she took off.

1141
01:30:14,475 --> 01:30:15,840
She was a blonde?

1142
01:30:17,445 --> 01:30:19,379
If she's a blonde,
I'm a double D.

1143
01:30:20,782 --> 01:30:22,306
What do you mean
by that?

1144
01:30:22,450 --> 01:30:24,145
She's a blonde
in a bottle.

1145
01:30:24,319 --> 01:30:27,117
That girl's had red hair
from the day she was born.

1146
01:30:30,858 --> 01:30:33,554
- Good night.
- Good night.

1147
01:30:39,667 --> 01:30:40,634
Oh, hey.

1148
01:30:40,768 --> 01:30:42,861
Are you going to let
Steve out before you go?

1149
01:30:43,004 --> 01:30:45,370
I don't know.
I haven't made up my mind yet.

1150
01:30:45,506 --> 01:30:47,736
We really don't have
anything to hold him on.

1151
01:30:48,876 --> 01:30:50,605
I know that.

1152
01:30:50,745 --> 01:30:52,406
Will you...

1153
01:30:52,547 --> 01:30:54,572
will you walk
Peg to her car?

1154
01:30:54,716 --> 01:30:56,411
Yeah.

1155
01:30:56,551 --> 01:30:58,246
Just call me
if you need me.

1156
01:30:58,419 --> 01:31:00,216
I will.

1157
01:31:07,996 --> 01:31:10,191
Do you still carry
that.38 in your purse?

1158
01:31:10,331 --> 01:31:12,060
This old thing?

1159
01:31:12,200 --> 01:31:14,725
I only carry this when
I don't know who to shoot.

1160
01:31:16,971 --> 01:31:18,495
You want a lift?

1161
01:31:18,639 --> 01:31:20,334
I'm just going to walk.

1162
01:31:20,441 --> 01:31:22,841
Are you sure?

1163
01:31:22,977 --> 01:31:25,036
I'll be okay.

1164
01:31:25,179 --> 01:31:27,875
Okay.
See you bright and early.

1165
01:31:28,016 --> 01:31:29,540
Good night, Peg.

1166
01:31:29,684 --> 01:31:31,311
Good night.

1167
01:31:47,468 --> 01:31:48,992
(screams)

1168
01:31:49,137 --> 01:31:52,106
Oh! You scared
the hell out of me.

1169
01:31:52,240 --> 01:31:53,730
You scared me.

1170
01:31:53,875 --> 01:31:55,740
What are you doing
in here, anyway?

1171
01:31:55,877 --> 01:31:58,209
I was waiting for you.
I got tired. I fell asleep.

1172
01:31:59,714 --> 01:32:02,877
Come on. Get out.
I'll drive.

1173
01:33:01,309 --> 01:33:04,176
Hi, this is Sheriff Clayton.
Is Ryan still there?

1174
01:33:05,813 --> 01:33:07,838
Maybe you can help me.
Who is this?

1175
01:33:07,982 --> 01:33:10,849
Reed, I need some information
about the California woman.

1176
01:33:11,018 --> 01:33:12,645
The one that
was killed in Brigham.

1177
01:33:12,820 --> 01:33:15,755
Yes, something from the autopsy report.
Can you pull that for me?

1178
01:33:17,358 --> 01:33:19,326
Yeah, sure I can hold.

1179
01:33:19,494 --> 01:33:21,485
I'm going to take off
and get some sleep.

1180
01:33:23,030 --> 01:33:24,691
I'm going to leave
everything set up,

1181
01:33:24,832 --> 01:33:26,993
- If that's all right?
- Yeah, sure.

1182
01:33:29,070 --> 01:33:31,971
Meredith, do you need
a place to stay?

1183
01:33:34,175 --> 01:33:36,609
My house...
it's kind of empty.

1184
01:33:37,979 --> 01:33:39,674
I'm going to be
here tonight.

1185
01:33:41,782 --> 01:33:44,751
No, thanks.
I'll just grab a motel.

1186
01:33:44,886 --> 01:33:47,753
I have an FBI charge card.

1187
01:33:47,889 --> 01:33:49,789
Never leave home
without it.

1188
01:33:51,859 --> 01:33:53,986
Yeah, no,
I'm still here.

1189
01:33:55,196 --> 01:33:58,461
Yeah, look under hair color.
I need to know if she was really blonde.

1190
01:33:58,599 --> 01:34:00,760
Thanks for the offer.

1191
01:34:00,902 --> 01:34:02,426
Yeah.

1192
01:34:02,570 --> 01:34:05,130
No, it's a strange question,
but I need to know

1193
01:34:05,273 --> 01:34:07,833
if she was a natural blonde
or if she dyed her hair.

1194
01:34:09,911 --> 01:34:11,503
Natural blonde.

1195
01:34:13,314 --> 01:34:15,248
You're absolutely sure
about that?

1196
01:34:15,383 --> 01:34:17,578
No, no. Uh-huh.

1197
01:34:17,752 --> 01:34:19,447
Yeah.
Thanks, Reed.

1198
01:34:30,998 --> 01:34:32,693
Where are you
taking me?

1199
01:34:32,833 --> 01:34:34,960
My place.

1200
01:34:35,102 --> 01:34:37,730
- Ed...
- Don't Ed me, Peg.

1201
01:34:37,872 --> 01:34:39,567
This is not
a make-out thing.

1202
01:34:39,707 --> 01:34:41,402
I don't want you
spending the night alone,

1203
01:34:41,542 --> 01:34:43,533
or any night alone,
until they catch this guy.

1204
01:34:43,678 --> 01:34:45,976
No fooling around?

1205
01:34:46,113 --> 01:34:47,740
Oh, I don't know.

1206
01:34:48,883 --> 01:34:50,475
No.

1207
01:34:50,651 --> 01:34:52,881
I'm saving myself
for our wedding night.

1208
01:34:54,355 --> 01:34:56,289
You better be.

1209
01:35:11,706 --> 01:35:13,469
Father in heaven...

1210
01:36:08,095 --> 01:36:10,393
- Are we here?
- Yeah.

1211
01:36:10,531 --> 01:36:12,829
- Did you clean?
- No.

1212
01:37:08,389 --> 01:37:10,482
Come on, come on,
come on.

1213
01:37:10,658 --> 01:37:12,785
Recording: We're sorry,
the cellular phone you are calling

1214
01:37:12,927 --> 01:37:14,827
is currently unavailable,
or out of the...

1215
01:38:58,632 --> 01:39:00,725
- Bishop.
- What are you doing up?

1216
01:39:00,801 --> 01:39:02,860
The baby's decided
he's a night owl.

1217
01:39:04,839 --> 01:39:06,568
I need to come in.

1218
01:39:06,707 --> 01:39:08,436
Yeah.
Come on in.

1219
01:39:11,011 --> 01:39:14,447
Between this baby and little Mac I don't
know if I'll ever get any sleep.

1220
01:39:14,582 --> 01:39:16,607
- Is Terry home?
- Yeah, he's in the kitchen.

1221
01:39:16,750 --> 01:39:19,218
He couldn't sleep either.
Are you hungry?

1222
01:39:19,386 --> 01:39:21,980
- Did you get any dinner?
- No.

1223
01:39:26,227 --> 01:39:27,751
Hey.
(chuckles)

1224
01:39:27,895 --> 01:39:29,760
I thought you were
going to get some sleep.

1225
01:39:29,897 --> 01:39:33,264
- (baby crying)
- There he goes again. I'll be back.

1226
01:39:33,400 --> 01:39:35,960
What's on your mind?

1227
01:39:36,103 --> 01:39:38,003
I don't think...

1228
01:39:38,138 --> 01:39:39,765
I'm ever going
to forgive myself.

1229
01:39:41,575 --> 01:39:43,566
What are you
talking about?

1230
01:39:43,711 --> 01:39:46,009
You know, Sarah had
this way of getting...

1231
01:39:46,146 --> 01:39:48,979
behind my eyes.

1232
01:39:49,116 --> 01:39:52,142
She could help me understand
what I was seeing.

1233
01:39:52,319 --> 01:39:53,786
If she was still here,

1234
01:39:53,954 --> 01:39:56,752
I would have figured out
this thing a long time ago.

1235
01:39:58,058 --> 01:40:00,219
I know I'm no substitute
for Sarah,

1236
01:40:00,361 --> 01:40:01,885
if you want to talk.

1237
01:40:14,575 --> 01:40:16,805
Lisa Colvin.

1238
01:40:19,580 --> 01:40:21,275
Do you remember her?

1239
01:40:21,415 --> 01:40:24,441
- Pretty girl, red hair.
- Yeah.

1240
01:40:24,618 --> 01:40:27,678
She died in that rock climbing
accident a few years ago.

1241
01:40:29,123 --> 01:40:32,615
- Right after you got here.
- Mm-hmm.

1242
01:40:32,793 --> 01:40:34,988
1 6 years old.

1243
01:40:36,330 --> 01:40:39,026
I can't stop thinking about
those shoes she was wearing.

1244
01:40:40,534 --> 01:40:43,526
- Remember?
- No.

1245
01:40:43,671 --> 01:40:46,834
The shoes...
they weren't made for hiking at all.

1246
01:40:49,643 --> 01:40:52,339
It never occurred to me
to look for foul play.

1247
01:40:52,479 --> 01:40:54,743
It was just
an accident, right?

1248
01:40:58,085 --> 01:40:59,518
Then Tammy Hillam.

1249
01:41:00,654 --> 01:41:03,589
She leaves for Hollywood
and just disappears.

1250
01:41:05,726 --> 01:41:08,354
All this time we've been
looking for her in Los Angeles.

1251
01:41:11,065 --> 01:41:13,898
I have this feeling that
she didn't get very far from town.

1252
01:41:16,370 --> 01:41:17,667
When you came to town,

1253
01:41:17,805 --> 01:41:19,966
Ralph couldn't
stop talking about you.

1254
01:41:22,142 --> 01:41:24,110
He said you were
the best worker he ever had.

1255
01:41:24,244 --> 01:41:26,644
Returned missionary,
Eagle Scout,

1256
01:41:26,780 --> 01:41:28,748
hard worker.

1257
01:41:28,882 --> 01:41:30,713
When I needed
part-time help,

1258
01:41:30,884 --> 01:41:33,352
I didn't think twice.
I just deputized you.

1259
01:41:33,520 --> 01:41:35,511
Then when I needed you
full-time,

1260
01:41:35,689 --> 01:41:38,123
it never crossed my mind
to run your prints.

1261
01:41:41,629 --> 01:41:43,893
I didn't even make you
fill out an application.

1262
01:41:46,800 --> 01:41:49,098
It couldn't have
happened anywhere,

1263
01:41:49,236 --> 01:41:51,761
but a place like this.

1264
01:41:53,974 --> 01:41:56,135
I finally got around
to running your prints.

1265
01:41:58,278 --> 01:42:01,213
The strange thing is,
you don't come up as Terry Woodruff.

1266
01:42:03,283 --> 01:42:05,979
I found Terry, though.
I found him in Snowflake, Arizona.

1267
01:42:07,855 --> 01:42:10,289
There was an article
about how he drowned.

1268
01:42:10,424 --> 01:42:13,120
In the Colorado River
on a youth trip

1269
01:42:13,260 --> 01:42:15,694
two weeks after
he got home from his mission.

1270
01:42:17,431 --> 01:42:19,991
There's another kid in town
who spent four years in prison

1271
01:42:20,134 --> 01:42:22,159
for raping and almost
killing a little girl.

1272
01:42:22,302 --> 01:42:24,634
A little red-haired girl.

1273
01:42:26,974 --> 01:42:29,499
The church folks talked
in the paper about how he had

1274
01:42:29,643 --> 01:42:32,476
turned his life around,
how he found God in prison.

1275
01:42:35,049 --> 01:42:37,313
And then
he just disappeared.

1276
01:42:39,553 --> 01:42:41,214
You know, the thing is...

1277
01:42:44,258 --> 01:42:46,954
your prints match that man.

1278
01:42:49,530 --> 01:42:51,589
I want you to tell me...

1279
01:42:52,866 --> 01:42:54,891
what you've done
with Jamie's body.

1280
01:43:19,626 --> 01:43:21,526
There's a...

1281
01:43:24,732 --> 01:43:27,394
there's this spot...

1282
01:43:27,534 --> 01:43:29,900
about a half a mile
up the canyon.

1283
01:43:31,038 --> 01:43:33,529
The horse trail forks off.

1284
01:43:33,674 --> 01:43:36,142
There's a little patch
of Joshua trees.

1285
01:43:36,276 --> 01:43:38,005
Joshua trees.

1286
01:43:39,146 --> 01:43:41,239
I put her in there.

1287
01:43:41,381 --> 01:43:43,076
- Tammy Hillam.
- (sobbing)

1288
01:43:44,518 --> 01:43:46,179
Did you put her
in there, too?

1289
01:43:52,059 --> 01:43:53,924
I don't know
what's wrong with me.

1290
01:44:00,334 --> 01:44:02,564
I don't know
why I can't stop.

1291
01:44:02,703 --> 01:44:05,103
I...

1292
01:44:05,239 --> 01:44:07,002
I've tried...

1293
01:44:07,141 --> 01:44:09,166
so hard...

1294
01:44:09,309 --> 01:44:11,140
to be good.

1295
01:44:13,080 --> 01:44:14,775
You've got
to help me.

1296
01:44:18,519 --> 01:44:20,453
I don't want to go
to hell.

1297
01:44:34,601 --> 01:44:36,125
Put those on.

1298
01:44:48,715 --> 01:44:50,546
There's one thing
I can't make sense of.

1299
01:44:52,653 --> 01:44:54,382
That woman from California.

1300
01:44:56,623 --> 01:44:58,318
Her hair wasn't red.

1301
01:45:00,127 --> 01:45:01,651
It was red...

1302
01:45:03,597 --> 01:45:05,155
when I finished with it.

1303
01:45:15,642 --> 01:45:17,735
Terry...

1304
01:45:17,878 --> 01:45:20,574
- Put on those cuffs.
- They don't forgive you.

1305
01:45:20,714 --> 01:45:22,648
Not ever.

1306
01:45:23,851 --> 01:45:26,615
For the rest of your life,
no matter how good you are,

1307
01:45:26,787 --> 01:45:29,255
everybody knows.

1308
01:45:32,426 --> 01:45:34,587
- I had no choice.
- (cocks)

1309
01:45:34,728 --> 01:45:36,719
I had to become
somebody else.

1310
01:45:36,864 --> 01:45:40,163
Terry, take your hands
off that weapon,

1311
01:45:40,300 --> 01:45:42,530
and put on
those handcuffs.

1312
01:45:42,669 --> 01:45:44,432
This whole thing's
your fault.

1313
01:45:44,571 --> 01:45:47,597
You put a badge on me
and a gun in my hand.

1314
01:45:48,809 --> 01:45:51,903
You were supposed to protect
this town from people like me.

1315
01:45:54,081 --> 01:45:56,276
You never even
checked my background.

1316
01:45:56,416 --> 01:45:58,475
What were you thinking?

1317
01:46:00,787 --> 01:46:03,312
You brought the wolf...

1318
01:46:03,490 --> 01:46:06,084
right into the center
of the flock.

1319
01:46:11,431 --> 01:46:12,796
Terry...

1320
01:46:12,933 --> 01:46:15,834
take your hands
off that gun.

1321
01:46:15,969 --> 01:46:19,097
- Terry?
- April, stay back.

1322
01:46:23,844 --> 01:46:26,972
- What have you done?
- Terry, please.

1323
01:46:27,114 --> 01:46:29,378
- Terry, what's going on?
- Terry: You're so naive.

1324
01:46:29,516 --> 01:46:31,882
You think you can
just close your eyes

1325
01:46:32,052 --> 01:46:34,486
and the world's going
to pass you by.

1326
01:46:35,656 --> 01:46:38,147
You think you can just...

1327
01:46:38,325 --> 01:46:40,850
get down on
your knees at night,

1328
01:46:40,994 --> 01:46:42,859
and say your prayers,

1329
01:46:42,996 --> 01:46:45,988
and God is going to protect you
from people like me.

1330
01:46:46,133 --> 01:46:47,964
(Terry snorts)

1331
01:46:48,101 --> 01:46:50,001
Well, guess what, Sheriff?

1332
01:46:50,137 --> 01:46:52,435
Jamie was praying
pretty hard at the end.

1333
01:46:52,572 --> 01:46:55,700
And come to think of it,
so were the others.

1334
01:46:55,842 --> 01:46:58,140
Isn't that something?

1335
01:46:58,278 --> 01:47:01,008
God isn't going
to stop me.

1336
01:47:02,616 --> 01:47:04,880
For all the praying
that goes on around here,

1337
01:47:05,052 --> 01:47:08,044
you'd think God would care
a little bit more about this town.

1338
01:47:08,221 --> 01:47:10,348
What is he talking about?

1339
01:47:11,658 --> 01:47:13,558
Terry, take your hands
off that gun.

1340
01:47:13,694 --> 01:47:15,355
You might as well have
killed those girls yourself.

1341
01:47:15,495 --> 01:47:17,793
- (baby crying)
- You're responsible.

1342
01:47:17,931 --> 01:47:19,523
You've got blood
on your hands.

1343
01:47:19,666 --> 01:47:21,395
- Bishop, no!
- Terry, please.

1344
01:47:21,535 --> 01:47:24,026
When these parents
find out what you've done,

1345
01:47:24,171 --> 01:47:25,729
they're going to spit
on your grave.

1346
01:47:25,872 --> 01:47:28,102
- Put the weapon down.
- What are you doing!?

1347
01:47:28,241 --> 01:47:30,004
April, take the baby out.

1348
01:47:31,144 --> 01:47:32,543
Take him out!

1349
01:47:34,982 --> 01:47:37,348
What do you think, Wes?

1350
01:47:37,517 --> 01:47:39,542
When I raise this gun,

1351
01:47:39,720 --> 01:47:41,654
am I going to point it
at my head or yours?

1352
01:47:47,694 --> 01:47:49,559
Tell them I'm sorry, Wes...

1353
01:47:53,233 --> 01:47:54,962
when you see
those girls.

1354
01:47:56,103 --> 01:47:58,230
- You tell them I'm sorry.
- (gun fires)

1355
01:47:58,372 --> 01:48:00,237
No! No!

1356
01:48:01,975 --> 01:48:04,034
(baby crying)

1357
01:48:05,245 --> 01:48:07,213
(April sobbing)

1358
01:48:14,287 --> 01:48:16,915
- April...
- You get out!

1359
01:48:17,090 --> 01:48:18,990
Get out of here!

1360
01:48:20,160 --> 01:48:21,957
(sobbing)

1361
01:48:55,896 --> 01:48:58,057
(sobbing)

1362
01:49:22,289 --> 01:49:24,723
(congregation singing)

1363
01:49:31,631 --> 01:49:33,496
(knocking)

1364
01:49:33,633 --> 01:49:35,863
(door opens)

1365
01:49:40,140 --> 01:49:41,732
Hello.

1366
01:49:45,712 --> 01:49:48,237
We're wrapping things up.
I just wanted to come in

1367
01:49:48,381 --> 01:49:50,372
and say goodbye.

1368
01:49:51,751 --> 01:49:54,219
We found out about
the California woman.

1369
01:49:54,387 --> 01:49:57,356
Turns out she was born
and raised in Snowflake, Arizona.

1370
01:49:57,524 --> 01:50:01,016
We figure he must have pulled
her over for a speeding ticket,

1371
01:50:01,161 --> 01:50:03,527
something like that.

1372
01:50:03,663 --> 01:50:05,528
Maybe she recognized him.

1373
01:50:07,033 --> 01:50:09,126
(Priest preaching)

1374
01:50:13,106 --> 01:50:16,234
The meeting's starting.
Are you going in?

1375
01:50:20,380 --> 01:50:22,814
I was supposed
to protect them.

1376
01:50:26,953 --> 01:50:29,285
I was supposed
to take care of them.

1377
01:50:32,692 --> 01:50:34,592
Nobody blames you.

1378
01:50:36,696 --> 01:50:38,561
You're a good man, Wes.

1379
01:50:38,698 --> 01:50:40,689
(organ playing)

1380
01:50:40,834 --> 01:50:42,563
You really are.

1381
01:50:46,239 --> 01:50:50,903

that they are willing to take
upon them the name of Thy Son,
