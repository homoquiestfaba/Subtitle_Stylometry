<i>Welcome to the season finale
of Strangers in a Penthouse.</i>

6
00:01:11,926 --> 00:01:16,192
Once there were ten, but now
only Lexi and Tyler are left.

7
00:01:16,264 --> 00:01:18,596
Who will win the penthouse?

8
00:01:18,666 --> 00:01:21,157
The competition is fierce.

9
00:01:21,235 --> 00:01:23,396
lt's not about the competition,

10
00:01:23,471 --> 00:01:25,098
Tyler and l are in love!

11
00:01:28,476 --> 00:01:31,001
<i> There aren't any losers
in the game of love.</i>

12
00:01:31,078 --> 00:01:33,706
<i>Lexi and I are gonna be
together forever.</i>

13
00:01:36,317 --> 00:01:40,048
We're going to live together in
the penthouse and make babies.

14
00:01:40,121 --> 00:01:43,887
We're live right now with
America's favorite strangers,

15
00:01:43,958 --> 00:01:45,755
<i>Tyler,</i>

16
00:01:45,826 --> 00:01:47,589
<i>and Lexi.</i>

17
00:01:47,662 --> 00:01:50,529
You must feel like a king
because you are a queen.

18
00:01:50,598 --> 00:01:53,328
<i>I'm gonna tell you,
you know, you got the--</i>

19
00:01:53,401 --> 00:01:56,768
Okay, so, there's only gonna
be one stranger

20
00:01:56,837 --> 00:02:01,240
that's gonna get this beautiful
penthouse. You dig?

21
00:02:01,309 --> 00:02:03,539
Are you ready?

22
00:02:10,451 --> 00:02:12,851
<i>Lexi and Tyler, I will tell you now</i>

23
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:15,388
<i>who the winner is of this
great penthouse...</i>

24
00:02:16,991 --> 00:02:18,982
You gotta be fucking kidding me, man.

25
00:02:20,761 --> 00:02:23,958
Congratulations, Tyler. How does
it feel to win the penthouse?

26
00:02:32,873 --> 00:02:35,933
l don't know what to say.
l'd like to thank my fans and Lexi.

27
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:39,138
Hey, baby! Congratulations.

28
00:02:39,213 --> 00:02:43,513
Sorry, l can't make it to the party
tonight. l'm feeling a little, uh,

29
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:45,779
a tickle in my throat.

30
00:02:45,853 --> 00:02:49,550
But l love you and l can't wait to
start my life with you tomorrow.

31
00:02:49,623 --> 00:02:51,614
<i> You should get
an agent now.</i>

32
00:02:51,692 --> 00:02:53,216
Actually, l have an agent.

33
00:02:53,294 --> 00:02:55,694
That guy's a dick.
You need to come with us.

34
00:02:55,763 --> 00:02:57,128
(Tyler) Your fly's open.

35
00:02:57,198 --> 00:02:59,325
Are you that reporter from
Channel 5?

36
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,662
Yes, l am.

37
00:03:00,735 --> 00:03:03,966
<i> Hi! It's me again!</i>

38
00:03:04,038 --> 00:03:07,940
Calling to tell you that l love you
and l was thinking about you.

39
00:03:08,009 --> 00:03:12,173
Call me when you get this. Bye.

40
00:03:31,432 --> 00:03:32,490
<i>Kieran!</i>

41
00:03:32,566 --> 00:03:34,056
<i>Are you coming over?</i>

42
00:03:34,135 --> 00:03:36,603
No, no. l'm at that,
that thing for Tyler.

43
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:40,106
lt's, it's a pretty great party,
if you--

44
00:03:40,174 --> 00:03:41,368
<i>Uh, uh</i>

45
00:03:41,442 --> 00:03:42,466
No?

46
00:03:42,543 --> 00:03:44,306
<i>No, I'm brushing my cat.</i>

47
00:03:44,378 --> 00:03:46,437
Okay. Yeah, no, l ,
l totally understand.

48
00:03:46,514 --> 00:03:49,108
That's, that's important, too.

49
00:04:00,528 --> 00:04:02,928
l love you.

50
00:04:02,997 --> 00:04:05,966
l love you so much.

51
00:04:06,033 --> 00:04:08,729
l love you like a motherfucker.

52
00:04:08,803 --> 00:04:12,637
l love you so much like
a motherfucker.

53
00:04:12,706 --> 00:04:15,971
Who are you talking to?

54
00:04:16,043 --> 00:04:18,944
My agent.

55
00:04:19,013 --> 00:04:22,540
<i> Come on! We're just gonna
go to my room. Come on.</i>

56
00:04:22,616 --> 00:04:26,143
You're fucking lrish, dammit.
You don't fucking pass out.

57
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:30,554
Heath, did you hear that this means
sex and this means lesbian sex?

58
00:04:30,624 --> 00:04:31,648
No, l didn't.

59
00:04:31,725 --> 00:04:32,749
What are you doing?

60
00:04:32,827 --> 00:04:34,260
Darling with a situation!

61
00:04:34,328 --> 00:04:35,352
She's just resting!

62
00:04:35,429 --> 00:04:36,453
She overdosed on me.

63
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:37,554
Let's go see Kieran.

64
00:04:41,302 --> 00:04:42,769
l don't fucking care.

65
00:04:42,837 --> 00:04:45,101
She's sleeping. She's sleeping.

66
00:04:45,172 --> 00:04:46,571
Thing's caught in her hair.

67
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,232
<i>You'll wake her up now.</i>

68
00:04:48,309 --> 00:04:50,777
l've been trying to wake her up
for a fucking hour.

69
00:04:50,845 --> 00:04:54,838
<i> I just don't get it. Why
is Bambi only a stripper's name?</i>

70
00:04:54,915 --> 00:04:57,884
l mean, originally, Bambi was a
badass boy deer's name.

71
00:04:57,952 --> 00:05:02,013
l want a name like fucking kid
Bambi, l can't see why l can't.

72
00:05:02,089 --> 00:05:03,818
How is Bambi a badass?

73
00:05:03,891 --> 00:05:05,859
Bambi was a badass, dude.

74
00:05:05,926 --> 00:05:07,484
<i>How have you been, man?</i>

75
00:05:07,561 --> 00:05:10,121
l've been great. Wow!

76
00:05:10,197 --> 00:05:11,858
Yeah? Huh? What did l tell ya?

77
00:05:11,932 --> 00:05:13,490
<i>It's amazing.</i>

78
00:05:13,567 --> 00:05:16,092
Uh, are you still with, uh...

79
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:17,228
Erica.

80
00:05:17,304 --> 00:05:18,601
Erica! Yeah.

81
00:05:18,672 --> 00:05:20,367
Dude.

82
00:05:20,441 --> 00:05:23,103
<i> We got this chick, fucking hot,
with big tits,</i>

83
00:05:23,177 --> 00:05:25,236
tanned, smooth, smooth.

84
00:05:25,312 --> 00:05:27,542
<i> And she'll lick your balls, man.</i>

85
00:05:27,615 --> 00:05:28,809
First date. First date.

86
00:05:28,883 --> 00:05:30,851
l'm, l , Erica and l are
still together.

87
00:05:30,918 --> 00:05:31,976
You sure?

88
00:05:32,052 --> 00:05:33,076
<i>Yes.</i>

89
00:05:33,154 --> 00:05:35,145
But she'll lick your balls.

90
00:05:35,222 --> 00:05:38,055
<i> You said you'd break up
with her, didn't he?</i>

91
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:39,319
<i> Yeah.</i>

92
00:05:39,393 --> 00:05:40,883
l tried.

93
00:05:40,961 --> 00:05:42,394
Bullshit.

94
00:05:42,463 --> 00:05:44,829
Bullshit. You know what?
Tonight, forget it.

95
00:05:44,899 --> 00:05:47,060
Forget it. Look at this. Huh?

96
00:05:47,134 --> 00:05:49,534
<i> What did I tell you
guys in high school?</i>

97
00:05:49,603 --> 00:05:52,128
<i>I'm gonna be famous, I'm gonna
make it. Did I not?</i>

98
00:05:52,206 --> 00:05:53,901
<i>You did.</i>

99
00:05:53,974 --> 00:05:55,999
<i>Guess who has a surprise
for the boys?</i>

100
00:05:59,613 --> 00:06:02,377
Can we, uh, can we slow down,
you think?

101
00:06:02,449 --> 00:06:06,579
Moving into that penthouse is just
a way of avoiding your potential.

102
00:06:06,654 --> 00:06:08,668
There's no way you can
excel in your life

103
00:06:08,669 --> 00:06:10,681
if you live with Heath and Tyler.

104
00:06:10,758 --> 00:06:13,142
<i>I'll be able to focus
on my writing. </i>

105
00:06:13,143 --> 00:06:15,525
<i>I won't be sweating a
rent every month.</i>

106
00:06:15,596 --> 00:06:17,621
How are you hiking in those boots?

107
00:06:17,698 --> 00:06:21,794
l'm sure there won't be any coarse
slutty drunken chick parties either.

108
00:06:21,869 --> 00:06:24,531
You make it sound like l'm
moving in with Hugh Hefner.

109
00:06:24,605 --> 00:06:27,005
l make it sound like you're
moving in with Tyler.

110
00:06:27,074 --> 00:06:28,905
You're being--

111
00:06:28,976 --> 00:06:32,412
l want my boyfriend to focus on
his future, not recapturing his past.

112
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:34,709
You'll be in a condescential
lost cause.

113
00:06:34,782 --> 00:06:35,908
That is not a word.

114
00:06:35,983 --> 00:06:37,575
Yes it is!

115
00:06:37,651 --> 00:06:40,051
You can't make up-- English--

116
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,179
<i>Can you please slow down?</i>

117
00:06:42,256 --> 00:06:45,885
<i>If you can't keep up with me now, how
will you keep up with me in 50 years?</i>

118
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,655
50 years?

119
00:06:47,728 --> 00:06:49,593
What? You just said---

120
00:06:49,663 --> 00:06:51,290
No. You said l--

121
00:06:51,365 --> 00:06:54,300
Are you--  l'm thinking--
What l'm trying to say--

122
00:06:54,368 --> 00:06:57,064
That we should get out of here
before the coyotes come?

123
00:06:57,137 --> 00:06:59,901
No, l'm not-- There are no coyotes
here. That's crazy.

124
00:06:59,974 --> 00:07:02,568
l'm trying to-- Listen.

125
00:07:02,643 --> 00:07:05,635
Maybe we should take a couple
of steps back.

126
00:07:07,214 --> 00:07:09,148
What the fuck does that mean?

127
00:07:11,185 --> 00:07:12,675
Okay.

128
00:07:12,753 --> 00:07:15,950
lt means l'm--

129
00:07:16,023 --> 00:07:19,322
<i>I'm just thinking maybe we--</i>

130
00:07:19,393 --> 00:07:21,327
l'm trying--

131
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:25,655
Fuck. Okay.

132
00:07:30,871 --> 00:07:33,965
Oh. Oh.

133
00:07:37,811 --> 00:07:40,143
So? How was our time apart?

134
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:07,168
Hey, Lexi!

135
00:08:07,241 --> 00:08:11,109
Kieran, hey! God there was
something l wanted to tell you.

136
00:08:11,178 --> 00:08:13,874
What was it? Oh, yeah!

137
00:08:13,947 --> 00:08:15,812
Go fuck yourself!

138
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:28,617
Hey, l , uh,
ran into Lexi in the hall.

139
00:08:28,696 --> 00:08:32,325
Yeah, she seems to be having trouble
revising our moving situation.

140
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,390
Bros before hoes.

141
00:08:34,468 --> 00:08:36,197
She'll come around.

142
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:39,535
What? Wait. You didn't
tell her that we were moving in?

143
00:08:42,242 --> 00:08:44,073
Ugh!

144
00:09:06,867 --> 00:09:08,664
This place is pretty sweet, right?

145
00:09:08,736 --> 00:09:10,601
lt's perfect.

146
00:09:10,671 --> 00:09:13,071
Honest, Tyler.
l don't know what to say.

147
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:14,835
Fuck you, man. Don't say nothing.

148
00:09:14,908 --> 00:09:17,433
What kind of schmuck doesn't
take care of his boys?

149
00:09:17,511 --> 00:09:19,706
This is gonna be like old times!

150
00:09:24,451 --> 00:09:26,919
<i>This DJ fucking sucks.</i>

151
00:09:32,693 --> 00:09:35,025
Come on.

152
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:48,003
<i>Hang in there. There's two
on yours and I'm getting his shit.</i>

153
00:09:48,075 --> 00:09:50,805
l'll be back.

154
00:09:50,878 --> 00:09:53,938
Dude! Bro!

155
00:09:54,014 --> 00:09:55,413
What the shit, man!

156
00:09:55,482 --> 00:09:58,474
Long time no see, bro!
This place is awesome!

157
00:09:58,552 --> 00:10:01,749
<i>Oh... Who's that?</i>

158
00:10:01,822 --> 00:10:03,289
<i>That's uh, Tyler's sister.</i>

159
00:10:03,357 --> 00:10:06,087
Oh. That's tough to look at, bro.

160
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,991
So anyway,
l heard you made it, man.

161
00:10:08,061 --> 00:10:10,825
l heard you had that story
published about that gopher.

162
00:10:10,898 --> 00:10:14,425
Yeah. Well, it really wasn't
about a gopher.

163
00:10:14,501 --> 00:10:15,525
<i>That's crazy, man.</i>

164
00:10:15,602 --> 00:10:17,399
lt's more like adventure---

165
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:18,733
That's crazy.

166
00:10:18,806 --> 00:10:20,171
Yeah.

167
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,504
Writing music
reviews for Rolling Stone?

168
00:10:22,576 --> 00:10:24,771
That is cool, man.

169
00:10:24,845 --> 00:10:29,111
Yo man, see that guy over there?
l fucking pissed in his Seven Up.

170
00:10:29,183 --> 00:10:31,708
<i>I pissed in his fucking Seven Up.</i>

171
00:10:34,021 --> 00:10:35,545
Anyway, dude. l gotta go, man.

172
00:10:35,622 --> 00:10:36,884
Alright. Go for it. Oh!

Call me, alright?

176
00:10:40,394 --> 00:10:40,985
You got it.

177
00:10:49,937 --> 00:10:53,930
<i> Hey...Yeah. No, they're,
uh, having a party. Hold on.</i>

178
00:10:54,007 --> 00:10:58,910
<i>I mean, a doctor. Wow.
So you must be like really smart.</i>

179
00:10:58,979 --> 00:11:01,004
Big brain.

180
00:11:03,717 --> 00:11:06,413
<i> Hey...sorry, Erica. It's, uh--</i>

181
00:11:06,487 --> 00:11:08,955
lt's a pretty crazy party.
What's going on?

182
00:11:09,022 --> 00:11:11,422
<i> I think it's time we moved
in together.</i>

183
00:11:13,927 --> 00:11:15,992
Listen, uh, l got to go
make a quick diagnosis.

184
00:11:15,993 --> 00:11:18,057
- l'll see you guys in a little bit.
- Okay.

185
00:11:18,131 --> 00:11:20,531
Have a drink
but don't drink too much.

186
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:29,204
<i>You have nothing to say
to that. Nothing at all?</i>

187
00:11:29,276 --> 00:11:31,369
No. No. No. l do.

188
00:11:31,445 --> 00:11:33,538
l'm just--

189
00:11:33,614 --> 00:11:36,549
Oh, my God. Tyler,

190
00:11:36,617 --> 00:11:40,178
he just took the fire extinguisher
and he's like spraying everything.

191
00:11:40,254 --> 00:11:42,119
Let me call you right back, okay?

192
00:11:45,025 --> 00:11:47,459
<i>What's up? Erica not
taking the break up so well?</i>

193
00:11:47,528 --> 00:11:49,587
No. She's loving it, Heath. Thanks.

194
00:11:50,831 --> 00:11:52,731
<i>Ah, there you are.</i>

195
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:55,632
<i>I knew you were gonna be a
pussy and not drink with us today,</i>

196
00:11:55,702 --> 00:11:57,465
so l need a big favor from you.
Okay?

197
00:11:57,538 --> 00:12:00,234
My sister is at this bar
across the street from LAX.

198
00:12:00,307 --> 00:12:02,104
Your sister?
What's she doing here?

199
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:04,473
She came to visit her
famous brother.

200
00:12:04,545 --> 00:12:06,945
<i>You're sitting here
worrying about that bitch.</i>

201
00:12:07,014 --> 00:12:09,710
You're depressing everybody.
Just go, get my sister,

202
00:12:09,783 --> 00:12:11,444
grab a drink and come back. Okay?

203
00:12:11,518 --> 00:12:13,452
<i>Go Go Go.</i>

204
00:12:28,201 --> 00:12:31,398
<i> I know, I'm sorry, Erica.</i>

205
00:12:31,471 --> 00:12:33,462
l just wanted a beer.

206
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:38,910
Um. No, l was caught by surprise,
you know?

207
00:12:38,979 --> 00:12:44,918
Yeah. l'm ready to move forward, too.

208
00:12:44,985 --> 00:12:47,078
<i>No, I can't come over right now.</i>

209
00:12:47,154 --> 00:12:50,146
<i>I'm gonna pick up Tyler's
little sister.</i>

210
00:12:50,223 --> 00:12:52,487
Relax.

211
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:55,653
She's like,
she's totally awkward and boyish.

212
00:12:55,729 --> 00:12:58,391
Yeah. l--

213
00:13:00,167 --> 00:13:03,159
Oh, shit. You know what?
l gotta go.

214
00:13:03,236 --> 00:13:04,965
Yeah. Bye.

215
00:13:05,038 --> 00:13:06,869
Hey! Trista!

216
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:09,033
<i> That'll be 13 dollars, sir.</i>

217
00:13:09,109 --> 00:13:11,134
13-- l didn't even-- Okay.

218
00:13:14,715 --> 00:13:16,410
Just-- Can you run that quickly?

219
00:13:16,483 --> 00:13:17,677
<i>Debit of credit?</i>

220
00:13:17,751 --> 00:13:19,514
Credit.

221
00:13:21,822 --> 00:13:26,816
<i>''Awkward and boyish.'' Not a very
nice way to talk about someone.</i>

222
00:13:26,893 --> 00:13:30,590
Uh, l didn't really mean it. She's--

223
00:13:30,664 --> 00:13:34,760
lt's my best friend's kid sister
and l--

224
00:13:34,835 --> 00:13:37,497
l just haven't seen her in
a long time.

225
00:13:37,571 --> 00:13:39,562
Maybe she's changed, huh?

226
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,870
Huh? Didn't really look like it.

227
00:13:41,942 --> 00:13:44,069
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

228
00:13:44,144 --> 00:13:45,668
Okay. Thank you, too.

229
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:52,211
Well, gotta run. Make the peace.

230
00:13:52,285 --> 00:13:55,413
Do you? Maybe you could have
your friend pick up the kid

231
00:13:55,489 --> 00:13:57,184
and you and l can get out of here?

232
00:13:57,257 --> 00:13:59,452
You don't know my friend.

233
00:13:59,526 --> 00:14:01,585
Wait. Wait. What did you say?

234
00:14:01,662 --> 00:14:06,690
At the Downtown Standard.
Maybe, uh, order room service.

235
00:14:08,969 --> 00:14:11,870
Are you-- What--

236
00:14:11,938 --> 00:14:15,032
That's, uh-- That's interesting.

237
00:14:15,108 --> 00:14:17,906
A bath could be involved.

238
00:14:17,978 --> 00:14:20,037
You want to take a bath?

239
00:14:20,113 --> 00:14:21,478
You want to join me?

240
00:14:21,548 --> 00:14:23,982
You don't even know me.
Are you--

241
00:14:32,392 --> 00:14:34,952
Hi, Kieran.

242
00:14:35,028 --> 00:14:36,461
That, that sucked.

243
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:39,328
<i>That was mean, that
was just downright mean.</i>

244
00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:42,095
''Awkward and boyish?''
Jeez, thanks a lot.

245
00:14:42,169 --> 00:14:43,363
l'm sorry.

246
00:14:43,437 --> 00:14:44,961
<i>But you look great, by the way.</i>

247
00:14:45,038 --> 00:14:48,166
Thanks. So do you.
Wow. You've changed.

248
00:14:48,241 --> 00:14:51,540
What's it like living
with my brother?

249
00:14:51,611 --> 00:14:54,739
lt's,  uh, it's an adventure.

250
00:15:17,237 --> 00:15:19,762
Hey, Heath. Seen my brother?

251
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,398
Uh, no.

252
00:15:21,475 --> 00:15:24,137
<i>He should be here somewhere.</i>

253
00:15:25,178 --> 00:15:27,078
<i> Tyler.</i>

254
00:15:27,147 --> 00:15:30,412
<i>Oh, I know that voice. Ah, how's
my little sister, my best friend.</i>

255
00:15:30,484 --> 00:15:32,145
How's my little sister?

256
00:15:32,219 --> 00:15:35,052
Sorry, l spilled some Champagne
and shit from some girl.

257
00:15:35,122 --> 00:15:36,987
Lovely, roses seem to agree with you.

258
00:15:37,057 --> 00:15:38,649
Looking good, huh?

259
00:15:38,725 --> 00:15:41,250
What do you think of the place?
Pretty nice, huh?

260
00:15:41,328 --> 00:15:43,922
Yeah. Strangely familiar.
So is there a room for me?

261
00:15:43,997 --> 00:15:45,931
Of course there's room for you,
my little sister.

262
00:15:45,932 --> 00:15:47,865
l've got room for my sister.

263
00:15:47,934 --> 00:15:55,568
<i> Oh, hi. Oh, you're pretty.
She's pretty.</i>

264
00:15:55,642 --> 00:15:57,371
You want to play with me?

265
00:15:57,444 --> 00:16:00,004
Please, stop. Oh, no, no, no.

266
00:16:06,887 --> 00:16:10,789
You like it? lt's slutty, right?

267
00:16:10,857 --> 00:16:14,315
<i>We gotta go. We parked
in a construction zone.</i>

268
00:16:14,394 --> 00:16:16,487
Don't worry about it,
l'll take care of it.

269
00:16:16,563 --> 00:16:17,587
<i>How?</i>

270
00:16:17,664 --> 00:16:18,722
l'm a doctor.

271
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:20,494
So how's Mom and Dad?

272
00:16:20,567 --> 00:16:24,503
<i>In a state of shock.
They caught a few episodes.</i>

273
00:16:24,571 --> 00:16:26,471
<i>Like most of that didn't even happen,</i>

274
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:29,100
because they, like, edited and stuff.

275
00:16:29,176 --> 00:16:33,010
<i>So, they-- That's my friend, Glen.</i>

276
00:16:36,516 --> 00:16:38,416
Okay, uh--

277
00:16:38,485 --> 00:16:42,114
l think your room's this way.
Let's make sure it's okay.

278
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:46,959
Wait here, okay? l'm gonna fix
everything. Alright?

279
00:16:47,027 --> 00:16:48,790
l'll be right back. Hold on.

280
00:17:44,317 --> 00:17:48,913
Fuck.

281
00:17:48,989 --> 00:17:52,220
Fucking head's gonna explode.

282
00:17:52,292 --> 00:17:55,750
What's another word for suicide
inducingly boring?

283
00:17:55,829 --> 00:17:57,626
Erica?

284
00:17:59,633 --> 00:18:03,364
Hey, so, uh,
you still reviewing Muzak?

285
00:18:03,436 --> 00:18:06,371
Yeah. Unless you can pay me
for my novel.

286
00:18:06,439 --> 00:18:08,031
What's it about?

287
00:18:08,108 --> 00:18:11,544
Uh, that's, uh,  that's
always such a tough question.

288
00:18:11,611 --> 00:18:14,876
lt's a tough question because
he hasn't fucking started it yet.

289
00:18:14,948 --> 00:18:17,473
<i>You're gonna wear out
that finger, buddy.</i>

290
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:19,814
Speaking of-- Did you
hook up last night?

291
00:18:19,886 --> 00:18:22,787
l hooked up last night. Yeah,
l hooked up. What about you?

292
00:18:22,856 --> 00:18:24,983
Or did they pass out on you again?

293
00:18:25,058 --> 00:18:28,994
<i> No, I exhausted myself moving the
construction equipment upstairs.</i>

294
00:18:29,062 --> 00:18:31,724
l think they had fun
with themselves.

295
00:18:31,798 --> 00:18:34,790
<i>Yeah? Aren't you sweet? What
did I tell you? Pace, pace, pace.</i>

296
00:18:34,868 --> 00:18:38,668
<i> How about you, First night,
single man, get a little--? </i>

297
00:18:38,738 --> 00:18:40,399
He probably fucked your sister.

298
00:18:40,473 --> 00:18:41,804
That's not funny.

299
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:43,536
Dude. l-- You know, l--

300
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:46,807
When you start a sentence with
''dude'' you say something stupid.

301
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:47,904
l tried.

302
00:18:47,981 --> 00:18:49,005
To fuck his sister?

303
00:18:49,082 --> 00:18:50,276
Dude! That's not funny.

304
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:51,408
Yes, it is.

305
00:18:51,484 --> 00:18:52,508
<i>Seriously.</i>

306
00:18:52,585 --> 00:18:54,280
Whatever.

307
00:18:54,354 --> 00:18:56,618
<i>We should focus on Kieran,
poor guy.</i>

308
00:18:56,690 --> 00:18:59,420
How are you feeling, buddy?
Are things okay?

309
00:18:59,492 --> 00:19:02,461
<i>You did break up with her, right?</i>

310
00:19:02,529 --> 00:19:07,660
Well, yeah, l mean, l said that we
should take a couple of steps back.

311
00:19:07,734 --> 00:19:09,497
Yeah. What the hell does that mean?

312
00:19:09,569 --> 00:19:11,264
lt means he's stuck in a
Paula Abdul song.

313
00:19:11,338 --> 00:19:14,000
No. lt means that l'm just trying
to let her down easy.

314
00:19:14,074 --> 00:19:15,803
<i>You cannot let a girl down easy.</i>

315
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:19,641
Man, she doesn't care. She's
gonna dominate you, bro.

316
00:19:19,713 --> 00:19:21,476
<i>She doesn't give a shit about you,</i>

317
00:19:21,548 --> 00:19:23,812
they only want to be better than
other girls.

318
00:19:23,883 --> 00:19:25,475
You got an exit strategy, pal?

319
00:19:25,552 --> 00:19:27,577
What is your exit strategy?
Come on.

320
00:19:27,654 --> 00:19:30,122
Well, l , l think we're going to
move in together.

321
00:19:33,293 --> 00:19:34,817
Jesus.

322
00:19:36,529 --> 00:19:39,362
Let me get this straight.
She'll let you break up with her

323
00:19:39,432 --> 00:19:40,990
as long as you move in together?

324
00:19:41,067 --> 00:19:43,797
Yeah, if you put it like that,
it sounds pretty stupid.

325
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:45,337
lt sounds stupid either way.

326
00:19:45,405 --> 00:19:46,429
No, it doesn't--

327
00:19:46,506 --> 00:19:48,030
Yeah, it does.

328
00:19:48,108 --> 00:19:50,201
lt makes sense when she explains it.

329
00:19:50,276 --> 00:19:52,176
Of course it does.

330
00:19:52,245 --> 00:19:54,462
She doesn't hear the same
rules of engagement as you,

331
00:19:54,463 --> 00:19:56,079
she's a fucking woman!

332
00:19:56,149 --> 00:19:57,173
l'm just going to punch you.

333
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:58,877
Are you kidding me?

334
00:19:58,952 --> 00:20:00,283
l'll punch you in the face.

335
00:20:00,353 --> 00:20:01,377
Dude--

336
00:20:01,454 --> 00:20:03,388
No. Don't dude me.

337
00:20:03,456 --> 00:20:06,357
Look, l just think l want to take
a shot at this thing.

338
00:20:06,426 --> 00:20:07,893
You moved in one day ago, bro!

339
00:20:07,961 --> 00:20:10,691
l know, but l feel this is a step
forward for us.

340
00:20:10,764 --> 00:20:12,715
So you're moving in together.

341
00:20:12,716 --> 00:20:14,666
That's how you're breaking
up with each other?

342
00:20:14,734 --> 00:20:16,497
What are you? Fucking retarded?

343
00:20:16,569 --> 00:20:19,902
l know we had this whole plan of
moving in together and being single

344
00:20:19,973 --> 00:20:21,907
and that sounds
really great in theory

345
00:20:21,975 --> 00:20:24,910
but l'm not gonna get any
writing done.

346
00:20:24,978 --> 00:20:27,947
<i>If I don't buckle down with Erica,
what's gonna happen?</i>

347
00:20:28,014 --> 00:20:31,006
l might end up being alone
and l want a life.

348
00:20:31,084 --> 00:20:35,453
Yeah? You are one
brainwashed son of a bitch!

349
00:20:35,522 --> 00:20:37,353
Look! This is a life!

350
00:20:37,424 --> 00:20:42,521
<i> This is a beautiful,
as seen on TV, life.</i>

351
00:20:42,595 --> 00:20:44,563
<i>Just because you're
28 years old--</i>

352
00:20:44,631 --> 00:20:46,121
30.

353
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:48,792
l'm 29.

354
00:20:50,437 --> 00:20:52,405
<i>I'm 29 years old.</i>

355
00:20:52,472 --> 00:20:54,804
<i> Hey, guys.</i>

356
00:20:54,874 --> 00:20:57,434
What did l miss? lt sounds deep.

357
00:20:57,510 --> 00:21:00,411
<i> We were just discussing
the appropriate conduct</i>

358
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,812
of a 21st century relationship.

359
00:21:02,882 --> 00:21:04,372
<i> I got work to do.</i>

360
00:21:04,451 --> 00:21:05,679
Pretty interesting.

361
00:21:05,752 --> 00:21:08,312
l'm 29. You know l'm 29.
Am l not 29?

362
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:16,324
There was a mistake on my
birth certificate.

363
00:21:16,396 --> 00:21:18,091
Ask mom!

364
00:21:18,164 --> 00:21:22,430
Wow, So, uh--

365
00:21:22,502 --> 00:21:26,302
Bloody Mary?
l make them really spicy.

366
00:21:29,075 --> 00:21:32,670
<i>So, how's the writing?</i>

367
00:21:32,745 --> 00:21:35,373
<i>Great! Good. Wow.</i>

368
00:21:35,448 --> 00:21:37,439
Yeah, no, it, it--

369
00:21:37,517 --> 00:21:40,145
lt couldn't be, uh,

370
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:42,688
How are things with you?

371
00:21:46,292 --> 00:21:49,420
My wife just left me.

372
00:21:49,496 --> 00:21:50,622
<i>Oh...</i>

373
00:21:50,697 --> 00:21:52,528
She took my dogs.

374
00:21:52,599 --> 00:21:53,930
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

375
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,525
<i>She took my dog's life.</i>

376
00:21:56,603 --> 00:21:58,002
Wow.

377
00:21:58,071 --> 00:22:01,302
<i>I got home and there was
blood everywhere.</i>

378
00:22:01,374 --> 00:22:05,811
She decorated the den with
Poochie's intestines.

379
00:22:05,879 --> 00:22:09,440
Like a garland around
a Christmrs tree.

380
00:22:09,516 --> 00:22:12,849
Hi.

381
00:22:12,919 --> 00:22:16,685
l took care of her.

382
00:22:19,659 --> 00:22:23,220
Kieran, you're so gullible!

383
00:22:23,296 --> 00:22:26,288
l-- Well--

384
00:22:26,366 --> 00:22:28,664
Why would you say those things?

385
00:22:28,735 --> 00:22:31,033
Because you just lied to me!

386
00:22:31,104 --> 00:22:34,665
<i>You told me everything's "Wow," I
haven't seen dick from you in months.</i>

387
00:22:34,741 --> 00:22:35,935
Okay.

388
00:22:36,009 --> 00:22:38,773
<i>Put your fiction on a page.</i>

389
00:22:38,845 --> 00:22:41,507
Don't spit it at my face

390
00:22:41,581 --> 00:22:43,071
and expect me to lick it up.

391
00:22:43,149 --> 00:22:45,777
Okay. l see your point.

392
00:22:45,852 --> 00:22:47,217
You really see my point?

393
00:22:47,287 --> 00:22:47,981
Yes. l do.

394
00:22:53,793 --> 00:22:55,158
Do you?

395
00:22:55,228 --> 00:22:56,388
Yeah.

396
00:22:56,462 --> 00:22:58,225
Do you want to see my point closer?

397
00:22:58,298 --> 00:23:00,528
l , l , l got it.

398
00:23:02,468 --> 00:23:04,595
Okay, okay. Yeah. No.

399
00:23:08,741 --> 00:23:12,268
See? That's what l love about you.
You're so gullible.

400
00:23:12,345 --> 00:23:14,643
Go on. Get out of here.

401
00:23:14,714 --> 00:23:16,511
<i>Go write me something brilliant.</i>

402
00:23:16,583 --> 00:23:18,414
You got it.

403
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:32,727
Look at that mouse.

404
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:35,597
<i>You're an idiot.
That Lexi was fucking hot.</i>

405
00:23:35,668 --> 00:23:37,465
Shut up, man.

406
00:23:37,537 --> 00:23:39,300
This is a reality show.

407
00:23:39,372 --> 00:23:42,500
She hasn't called me one time since
l let you guys moved in here.

408
00:23:42,575 --> 00:23:44,065
lt's reality.

409
00:23:44,143 --> 00:23:45,974
<i>It shows what her real motives were.</i>

410
00:23:46,045 --> 00:23:47,569
Whatever. She's fucking hot.

411
00:23:47,647 --> 00:23:49,740
What about this girl?
You think she's hot?

412
00:23:49,816 --> 00:23:52,444
Yeah. l do.

413
00:23:52,518 --> 00:23:55,043
No, that's a tranny.

414
00:23:55,121 --> 00:23:57,282
l'm not good at this.

415
00:23:57,357 --> 00:24:01,225
<i>Some people like trannies, my friend,
apparently you're one of them.</i>

416
00:24:01,294 --> 00:24:04,320
<i>Whatever. So what are
we gonna do about Kieran?</i>

417
00:24:04,397 --> 00:24:07,025
We can't let him move in
with that bitch.

418
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:09,017
<i>You gotta use that doctor's
brain of yours and</i>

419
00:24:09,018 --> 00:24:10,934
<i>help me figure something out.</i>

420
00:24:11,004 --> 00:24:12,733
l have one idea.

421
00:24:12,805 --> 00:24:14,272
What is it?

422
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:18,106
We arrange for him to get laid.

423
00:24:18,177 --> 00:24:21,476
<i>And then we throw it up on You Tube
and then call her up and tell her.</i>

424
00:24:21,547 --> 00:24:23,344
<i>I like that one.
We can get some girls.</i>

425
00:24:23,416 --> 00:24:25,543
We can throw a party,
get him all fucked up,

426
00:24:25,618 --> 00:24:27,450
tell them that Kieran has this
huge cock,

427
00:24:27,451 --> 00:24:29,281
well, no one would believe that.

428
00:24:29,355 --> 00:24:31,880
We'll say he's a billionaire.
Bitches love money.

429
00:24:31,958 --> 00:24:33,926
l like it.
l'm getting some ideas here.

430
00:24:33,993 --> 00:24:37,656
l'm gonna go round up some
sluts and go see my agent.

431
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:41,530
And uh, you may be sporting
some wood there, tranny lover.

432
00:24:47,907 --> 00:24:50,102
<i>CAA...can I help you?</i>

433
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:52,610
Hey, it's That Tyler. ls Doug there?

434
00:24:52,679 --> 00:24:55,375
<i>One second please,
I have That Tyler on line 2.</i>

435
00:24:55,448 --> 00:24:57,006
Oh, put him through, please.

436
00:24:57,083 --> 00:24:58,812
<i> Big T!</i>

437
00:24:58,885 --> 00:25:02,343
Hey, uh, l'm not feeling so well.
l'm not gonna make it in today.

438
00:25:02,422 --> 00:25:04,982
l feel like this tickle in my throat.

439
00:25:05,058 --> 00:25:08,494
You want an ambulance? Lucy, get
an ambulance. No, l'm just kidding,

440
00:25:08,561 --> 00:25:11,724
<i>No, but I've got very big words
for you today, Buzz McManus!</i>

441
00:25:11,798 --> 00:25:13,698
Buzz McManus,
ladies and gentlemen!

442
00:25:13,766 --> 00:25:15,563
Okay. Who's that?

443
00:25:15,635 --> 00:25:18,798
Oh, my God. ls 2 plus 2 not equal
to 22 in your beautiful brain?

444
00:25:18,871 --> 00:25:20,862
<i>I'm kidding, you're smart.
Seriously,</i>

445
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:24,000
<i>Buzz McManus is the gatekeeper
to your celebrity, dumb babe.</i>

446
00:25:24,077 --> 00:25:26,238
He'll make it happen for you.

447
00:25:26,312 --> 00:25:28,542
lsn't he the dickhead on MTV?

448
00:25:28,614 --> 00:25:31,447
No, no, but he's similar.
ln fact, he's better. Okay?

449
00:25:31,517 --> 00:25:34,350
And he's going to give you a
private show at the penthouse

450
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:37,218
<i>to announce the autobiography,
the book signing,</i>

451
00:25:37,290 --> 00:25:39,986
<i>and season one DVD of Strangers.</i>

452
00:25:40,059 --> 00:25:42,027
What else you got for me?

453
00:25:42,095 --> 00:25:46,327
<i>How about a few swanky appearances?
You ever heard of Putas Locas before?</i>

454
00:25:46,399 --> 00:25:48,026
<i>Pu, pu, puro what?</i>

455
00:25:48,101 --> 00:25:49,864
<i>I don't speak Spanish either.</i>

456
00:25:49,936 --> 00:25:53,428
But they've heard of you. They want
you to come down, grab a camcorder,

457
00:25:53,506 --> 00:25:56,475
<i>maybe get girls to take their
blouses off, sign autographs,</i>

458
00:25:56,542 --> 00:25:59,409
maybe sign tits, if l could only
have your life for one minute.

459
00:25:59,479 --> 00:26:01,811
l'd pound it to myself in the
mirror everyday.

460
00:26:01,881 --> 00:26:04,349
l mean, not that l don't
do that anyway.

461
00:26:04,417 --> 00:26:08,854
Okay. Can you find something
good for me, like maybe a pilot?

462
00:26:08,921 --> 00:26:12,618
l mean, l have talent.
Uh, maybe something on MTV,

463
00:26:12,692 --> 00:26:15,377
<i>maybe a VH 1 reality show, </i>

464
00:26:15,378 --> 00:26:18,062
<i>a celebrity rehab 101,
something classy.</i>

465
00:26:18,131 --> 00:26:20,531
<i>Right, right, I mean,
I see where you're driving.</i>

466
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:24,229
l do, but it's pitch black and you
got a busted headlight.

467
00:26:24,303 --> 00:26:26,168
Uh, can you just talk normal?

468
00:26:26,239 --> 00:26:29,208
You have to crawl before
you walk, Tyler.

469
00:26:32,879 --> 00:26:35,973
l can't wait until you meet
my mom tonight.

470
00:26:36,048 --> 00:26:38,107
lt's gonna be so much fun.

471
00:26:38,184 --> 00:26:39,651
Tonight?

472
00:26:39,719 --> 00:26:40,549
Yeah!

473
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:42,019
Remember?

474
00:26:42,088 --> 00:26:43,851
We have reservations.

475
00:26:46,225 --> 00:26:50,252
Hey! ls this Mandy or is this Sandy?

476
00:26:50,329 --> 00:26:52,797
No, it's Tyler.

477
00:26:52,865 --> 00:26:53,854
Are you serious?

478
00:26:53,933 --> 00:26:55,525
Yeah, no, it's ball party.

479
00:26:55,601 --> 00:26:58,126
No, no, l'm just on the phone--

480
00:26:58,204 --> 00:27:00,764
Uh. No, no. That'll be--
That's my cousin.

481
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:01,966
<i>You're so rude!</i>

482
00:27:19,826 --> 00:27:21,657
Doctor Bellotti's office?

483
00:27:32,338 --> 00:27:34,966
Boss's daughter is pretty hot.

484
00:27:36,776 --> 00:27:38,801
Actually, that's the boss.

485
00:27:38,878 --> 00:27:42,075
Hi, Doctor Bellotti.

486
00:27:42,148 --> 00:27:44,275
<i>Have a seat. Glad to meet you.</i>

487
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:47,046
Uh, you, you can just call me Heath.

488
00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:48,916
l've never had a male nurse before.

489
00:27:48,988 --> 00:27:50,785
l've never been a male nurse before.

490
00:27:50,857 --> 00:27:53,758
Just so you know, l tried to have
you reassigned elsewhere

491
00:27:53,826 --> 00:27:55,487
based on your lack of experience

492
00:27:55,561 --> 00:27:58,029
but the Administration
said it was you or no one

493
00:27:58,097 --> 00:28:00,190
and l need the nurse power
so here you are.

494
00:28:00,266 --> 00:28:02,166
Thanks for the vote
of confidence.

495
00:28:02,235 --> 00:28:04,135
Do you know anything
about children?

496
00:28:04,203 --> 00:28:07,400
l never wrap it up.

497
00:28:07,473 --> 00:28:08,667
Joke.

498
00:28:11,143 --> 00:28:13,976
<i>I'm gonna tell you now because
I don't want to get sued.</i>

499
00:28:14,046 --> 00:28:16,464
l always take my new
nurses out to

500
00:28:16,465 --> 00:28:18,881
lunch to get to know them
on a personal level.

501
00:28:18,951 --> 00:28:22,580
So l will extend the invitation to
you and if you choose not to accept,

502
00:28:22,655 --> 00:28:25,715
l won't be particularly crushed
if you catch my meaning.

503
00:28:25,791 --> 00:28:30,091
As long as we go somewhere
that serves lobster, l'm there.

504
00:28:32,231 --> 00:28:34,756
That's the look that says
''You must be joking.''

505
00:28:34,834 --> 00:28:35,858
<i>I am joking.</i>

506
00:28:35,935 --> 00:28:37,163
Good.

507
00:28:37,236 --> 00:28:39,170
But anywhere is fine with me,
you know?

508
00:28:39,238 --> 00:28:41,433
<i>I'll go anywhere with you,
I don't care.</i>

509
00:28:43,943 --> 00:28:47,344
What guy would be crazy enough to
turn down a date with a beautiful--

510
00:28:47,413 --> 00:28:48,903
lt's not a date.

511
00:28:48,981 --> 00:28:50,949
Okay.

512
00:28:51,017 --> 00:28:52,917
<i>I like it here, it's nice.</i>

513
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:05,898
lnteresting Feng Shui.

514
00:29:05,965 --> 00:29:07,956
Yeah.

515
00:29:08,034 --> 00:29:10,969
l think your decorator
may be morally wanting.

516
00:29:11,037 --> 00:29:12,766
l think you're right.

517
00:29:12,838 --> 00:29:17,104
<i>But it is convenient when you
want to have a good time.</i>

518
00:29:17,176 --> 00:29:20,043
You looking for a good time?

519
00:29:20,112 --> 00:29:25,140
Considering my brother flaked
on me for lunch, yeah, kinda.

520
00:29:25,217 --> 00:29:28,778
Why? Are you offering?

521
00:29:28,854 --> 00:29:32,654
l've, l've got work to do but, uh--

522
00:29:34,226 --> 00:29:37,093
Diarja is available.

523
00:29:37,163 --> 00:29:40,621
lf you want to have a good time,
call me, Diarja.

524
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:43,897
l will make your wildest dreams,
a...Be-ality.

525
00:29:43,970 --> 00:29:45,801
l think that's a typo.

526
00:29:45,871 --> 00:29:48,499
Still, it's pretty tempting.

527
00:29:48,574 --> 00:29:49,973
lt's a fine looking he-she.

528
00:29:50,042 --> 00:29:51,566
<i>Enjoy yourself.</i>

529
00:29:51,644 --> 00:29:52,770

530
00:31:16,462 --> 00:31:17,520
<i>Hey, man.</i>

531
00:31:17,596 --> 00:31:19,325
Hey.

532
00:31:19,398 --> 00:31:22,731
Look, l've had a few drinks but this
is not why l'm gonna say this.

533
00:31:22,802 --> 00:31:28,263
<i>I just want to let you know
I'm sorry about this morning.</i>

534
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:30,331
l want you to have fun, uh--

535
00:31:34,213 --> 00:31:35,840
Fuck you, don't say nothing.

536
00:31:37,383 --> 00:31:39,408
l can be a real dick sometimes.

537
00:31:39,485 --> 00:31:40,918
No.

538
00:31:40,986 --> 00:31:43,113
No. More than one person
has told me this.

539
00:31:43,189 --> 00:31:45,288
<i>That I don't mean to be,
I just get on,</i>

540
00:31:45,289 --> 00:31:47,387
<i>I just want you to enjoy yourself--</i>

541
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:50,122
No, it's, it's, don't worry about it,
just forget it.

542
00:31:50,196 --> 00:31:51,079
<i>I'll make it up to you.</i>

543
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:53,962
Let's go downstairs,
have a little fun, there's people--

544
00:31:54,033 --> 00:31:56,593
No, Tyler, l just started
like writing

545
00:31:56,669 --> 00:32:00,503
and it's going really well,
so l'd rather just stay in the zone.

546
00:32:00,573 --> 00:32:03,235
Okay. Listen to me.

547
00:32:03,309 --> 00:32:06,904
l'll be good.
l promise l will be good.

548
00:32:06,979 --> 00:32:08,970
<i>Okay?</i>

549
00:32:09,048 --> 00:32:12,540
<i>Just 5 minutes, 10 minutes,
30 minutes.</i>

550
00:32:12,618 --> 00:32:14,916
<i>Like an hour, tops I swear to God.</i>

551
00:32:14,987 --> 00:32:16,386
lf it's going well, who knows.
Let's go.

552
00:32:16,455 --> 00:32:17,615
Alright.

553
00:32:17,690 --> 00:32:19,783
That's my boy. See?

554
00:32:19,859 --> 00:32:21,986
You need some shorts.

555
00:32:25,498 --> 00:32:29,298
<i>Hey, he's coming, he's coming.</i>

556
00:32:29,368 --> 00:32:32,531
<i> He's awesome. There he is,</i>

557
00:32:32,605 --> 00:32:35,972
<i>now look at the big boy!
Look at him! Ready for the spa.</i>

558
00:32:36,041 --> 00:32:38,339
Hey, Kieran, this is Andy and Sandy.

559
00:32:38,410 --> 00:32:40,139
Hi.

560
00:32:40,212 --> 00:32:42,544
<i>This is Kieran, guys.
The man of the legend.</i>

561
00:32:42,615 --> 00:32:43,673
<i>Are you gonna get in?</i>

562
00:32:43,749 --> 00:32:45,239
Do l have a choice?

563
00:32:45,317 --> 00:32:47,444
You either go in on your own
or we throw you.

564
00:32:52,792 --> 00:32:54,316
Oh, my--

565
00:32:54,393 --> 00:32:56,657
Did you really have to do that?

566
00:32:58,864 --> 00:33:02,265
Make some room--
Oh. Okay. Crazy.

567
00:33:02,334 --> 00:33:06,031
Mandy's working in the tanning salon
across the street from Tyler's gym.

568
00:33:06,105 --> 00:33:09,404
<i>And Kieran here is an editor at
Rolling Stone.</i>

569
00:33:09,475 --> 00:33:10,806
Wow, that's cool.

570
00:33:10,876 --> 00:33:11,934
You know Bon Jovi?

571
00:33:12,011 --> 00:33:13,376
No, l don't.

572
00:33:13,445 --> 00:33:15,879
Why don't you introduce me
to Denise Richards?

573
00:33:15,948 --> 00:33:17,279
What about Jay-Z?

574
00:33:17,349 --> 00:33:19,442
<i>No, I don't really,
it's not like that.</i>

575
00:33:19,518 --> 00:33:21,645
Come on, man.
He produced his last album.

576
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:24,348
lsn't that right, Mr. DJ Krush?

577
00:33:24,423 --> 00:33:26,584
You're DJ Krush?
l thought he was Japanese.

578
00:33:26,659 --> 00:33:30,390
<i> He's actually native Japanese
but it's all above the waist.</i>

579
00:33:30,462 --> 00:33:32,828
But, but, his grandpa was actually
half black,

580
00:33:32,898 --> 00:33:36,425
he's got those genes in his genes,
if you can smell what l'm cooking.

581
00:33:36,502 --> 00:33:38,163
Bullshit.

582
00:33:38,237 --> 00:33:40,967
Don't you have like that huge
butterfly collection?

583
00:33:49,248 --> 00:33:51,978
Everybody, it's time to go
play strip tag!

584
00:33:52,051 --> 00:33:53,518
<i>You're it, Tyler!</i>

585
00:33:56,322 --> 00:33:57,687
<i>Out of the way.</i>

586
00:33:57,756 --> 00:33:58,848
Okay.

587
00:34:09,235 --> 00:34:10,497
Hey.

588
00:34:10,569 --> 00:34:12,093
<i>Hey.</i>

589
00:34:19,178 --> 00:34:21,112
Who's it? Should l go--

590
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:23,045
No. no. Stay. l'll be right back.

591
00:34:23,115 --> 00:34:24,173
Yeah. You--

592
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:27,378
Okay, alright. Okay.

593
00:34:29,288 --> 00:34:30,949
<i>Where did Kieran go?</i>

594
00:34:31,023 --> 00:34:34,857
l don't know. He's running around,
playing tag or whatever.

595
00:34:34,927 --> 00:34:36,258
Are you guys--

596
00:34:36,328 --> 00:34:37,920
<i>Stop it!</i>

597
00:34:37,997 --> 00:34:39,726
Okay.

598
00:34:45,504 --> 00:34:47,267
Oh.

599
00:34:47,339 --> 00:34:49,466
Hey, Glen!

600
00:34:49,541 --> 00:34:52,032
<i>Morning, man.</i>

601
00:34:52,111 --> 00:34:54,944
We were, uh, strip tagging here.

602
00:34:55,014 --> 00:34:58,950
That's--

603
00:34:59,018 --> 00:35:01,543
<i>There's a pool. And a room.</i>

604
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:03,485
<i>He's a really good guy, man.</i>

605
00:35:03,555 --> 00:35:06,422
He seems like a nice guy,
he's really cute.

606
00:35:06,492 --> 00:35:07,584
You think so?

607
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:09,787
Yeah. He's got really nice eyes.

608
00:35:09,862 --> 00:35:11,193
<i>Is he single?</i>

609
00:35:11,263 --> 00:35:13,163
No, no. He's married.

610
00:35:17,002 --> 00:35:19,800
<i>Kieran, go, go. Come on, buddy.</i>

611
00:35:19,872 --> 00:35:20,998
<i>Oh!</i>

612
00:35:21,073 --> 00:35:22,131
Oh!

613
00:35:25,744 --> 00:35:28,144
Oh ! lt's kind of cold.

614
00:35:39,058 --> 00:35:41,253
<i>I wish there was more!</i>

615
00:35:41,327 --> 00:35:43,625
<i>Somebody pee in the pool.</i>

616
00:35:43,696 --> 00:35:46,062
Hey, bro, l missed you at lunch.

617
00:35:46,131 --> 00:35:48,725
<i>Oh, yeah, I was at my agent's,
and uh,</i>

618
00:35:48,801 --> 00:35:52,567
his building's cement so there's
like, l couldn't get a signal.

619
00:35:52,638 --> 00:35:53,662
Maybe tomorrow?

620
00:35:53,739 --> 00:35:56,435
Yeah. You're it. Go, go, go.

621
00:36:03,248 --> 00:36:05,079
<i>Oh.</i>

622
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:07,084
<i>Are you trying to get me drunk?</i>

623
00:36:07,152 --> 00:36:08,915
<i>Yeah.</i>

624
00:36:14,293 --> 00:36:16,853
Hey.

625
00:36:19,264 --> 00:36:21,755
Oh.

626
00:36:21,834 --> 00:36:24,029
<i>Where are you going, man?</i>

627
00:36:24,103 --> 00:36:25,468
Why are you leaving?

628
00:36:25,537 --> 00:36:27,630
<i>It's cool, I'll see you later.</i>

629
00:36:27,706 --> 00:36:29,901
l'll check you later.

630
00:36:35,014 --> 00:36:36,675
Are you smoking?

631
00:36:36,749 --> 00:36:38,376
<i>Does Tyler know you smoke?</i>

632
00:36:38,450 --> 00:36:39,417
Do l care?

633
00:36:43,889 --> 00:36:46,153
So you leave the festivity so soon?

634
00:36:46,225 --> 00:36:49,558
Yeah, it's not really my thing.

635
00:36:49,628 --> 00:36:52,324
Yeah, it looked like you were
having a terrible time.

636
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:57,425
So why don't you offer me a drink?

637
00:36:57,503 --> 00:36:59,471
'Cause you're a baby.

638
00:36:59,538 --> 00:37:02,166
l mean, aren't you still a minor?

639
00:37:02,241 --> 00:37:04,710
Jeez. You and Tyler used
to fill up the

640
00:37:04,711 --> 00:37:07,178
thermoses out of Mom's box of wine.

641
00:37:07,246 --> 00:37:09,111
You knew about that?

642
00:37:09,181 --> 00:37:11,775
Wow.

643
00:37:13,585 --> 00:37:17,180
l'll just, uh, go change.

644
00:37:17,256 --> 00:37:19,053
Don't do it on my account.

645
00:37:26,365 --> 00:37:29,459
<i>Beer.</i>

646
00:37:29,535 --> 00:37:31,799
<i>Gotta be kidding me.</i>

647
00:37:44,149 --> 00:37:46,811
Can't even jerk off.

648
00:37:46,885 --> 00:37:51,822
So l read that short story you wrote
about running away from home.

649
00:37:51,890 --> 00:37:54,120
The one that got published.

650
00:37:54,193 --> 00:37:55,888
You mean the one about the gopher.

651
00:37:55,961 --> 00:38:00,022
Yeah. lt wasn't really about
a gopher, though.

652
00:38:00,099 --> 00:38:02,499
<i>It's really good.</i>

653
00:38:02,568 --> 00:38:03,865
Thanks.

654
00:38:03,936 --> 00:38:05,961
<i>You still want to be a writer?</i>

655
00:38:06,038 --> 00:38:09,667
Definitely, yeah, it's, uh--

656
00:38:12,377 --> 00:38:16,370
Sometimes it just-- lt seems so
far away, you know, like,

657
00:38:16,448 --> 00:38:19,008
like impossibly far away.

658
00:38:19,084 --> 00:38:21,518
Like those buildings out there.

659
00:38:21,587 --> 00:38:27,048
They're right there, but they're not.
They're pretty far away, you know?

660
00:38:27,126 --> 00:38:30,289
They are pretty far away.

661
00:38:30,362 --> 00:38:32,421
No more for you.

662
00:38:32,498 --> 00:38:34,193
Yeah. l deserve that.

663
00:38:34,266 --> 00:38:36,928
So, what are you writing now?

664
00:38:37,002 --> 00:38:39,732
Uh, just reviewing music.

665
00:38:39,805 --> 00:38:41,705
That sounds really cool.

666
00:38:41,773 --> 00:38:44,936
Uh, hm. No, it's definitely not cool.

667
00:38:45,010 --> 00:38:47,706
lt's, uh, you know what Muzak is?

668
00:38:47,779 --> 00:38:49,906
l know what Muzak is.

669
00:38:49,982 --> 00:38:51,882
l'm a huge fan of Muzak.

670
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:53,383
No you're not.

671
00:38:53,452 --> 00:38:55,113
l'm the biggest fan of Muzak.

672
00:38:55,187 --> 00:38:56,245
No, you're not.

673
00:38:56,321 --> 00:38:58,118
Muzak sucks.

674
00:38:58,190 --> 00:39:00,055
lt's the worst.

675
00:39:00,125 --> 00:39:03,356
lt's like the soundtrack for all
the places you don't want to be.

676
00:39:03,428 --> 00:39:05,259
Shit.

677
00:39:06,965 --> 00:39:10,025
So what are you doing here?

678
00:39:10,102 --> 00:39:14,129
l don't know. l'm probably
gonna move out, but--

679
00:39:16,141 --> 00:39:19,338
lt's a great life, isn't it?

680
00:39:19,411 --> 00:39:22,209
Come on, it's a penthouse, right?

681
00:39:22,281 --> 00:39:23,805
Right.

682
00:39:23,882 --> 00:39:26,749
lt is a penthouse.

683
00:39:29,588 --> 00:39:32,557
l don't know l mean, it kinds seems
like a waste, you know?

684
00:39:36,562 --> 00:39:38,029
Well.

685
00:39:38,096 --> 00:39:40,155
<i>I ought to get out of here.</i>

686
00:39:40,232 --> 00:39:42,246
<i>We wouldn't want that sauce to
cause us to do something crazy,</i>

687
00:39:42,247 --> 00:39:44,259
now would we?

688
00:39:45,537 --> 00:39:46,663
Good night, Kieran.

689
00:39:46,738 --> 00:39:48,069
Yeah, good night.

690
00:40:51,303 --> 00:40:54,238
<i>Design Features of style.</i>

691
00:40:54,306 --> 00:40:56,297
Very inexpensive to heat.

<i>Energy efficient.</i>

693

l--

695
00:41:03,515 --> 00:41:06,814
Are we standing in the closet
right now?

696
00:41:06,885 --> 00:41:11,151
<i>I got you covered. There is room

Who the fuck are you?

702
00:41:41,286 --> 00:41:42,810
l'm sorry.

703
00:41:52,164 --> 00:41:55,861
<i>Great, uh, Roy, you wanna tell us
a little bit about yourself?</i>

704
00:41:55,934 --> 00:41:57,231
lt's pronounced ''Rwa.''

705
00:41:57,302 --> 00:42:00,362
Okay, Raw.

706
00:42:00,439 --> 00:42:02,999
We just knock it out then? Huh?

707
00:42:04,376 --> 00:42:07,209
Okay. l , uh, like the outdoors,

708
00:42:07,279 --> 00:42:10,407
<i>I have two sisters,
my dad's a bastard,</i>

if you're real?

714
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:24,585
No touching, okay?

715
00:42:24,663 --> 00:42:26,028
Alright, Raw?

716
00:42:26,098 --> 00:42:27,292
lt's pronounced ''Rwa.''

717
00:42:27,366 --> 00:42:28,390
''Wa?''

718
00:42:28,467 --> 00:42:30,025
''Rwa.''

719
00:42:30,102 --> 00:42:31,160
'' Rwa!''

00:42:32,270 --> 00:42:33,328
''Wa,'' ''Wa.''

722
00:42:33,405 --> 00:42:35,032
''Wa,'' okay, ''Wa.''

723
00:42:35,107 --> 00:42:38,167
<i>Well, we'll give you a ring.</i>

724

Hey.

Wha--

726
00:42:42,247 --> 00:42:43,305
Yes!

l have no idea.

728
00:42:45,183 --> 00:42:48,346
Everybody, let's give a warm
round of applause for Kieran

729
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:50,547
<i>whose early departure
from the penthouse</i>

730
00:42:50,622 --> 00:42:54,388
<i>is giving you the opportunity of
a lifetime to live with me, Tyler.</i>

731
00:42:54,459 --> 00:42:57,553
<i>And, uh, that's my sister.</i>

732
00:42:57,629 --> 00:43:02,828
Seriously, you do have the
opportunity of a lifetime,

733
00:43:02,901 --> 00:43:04,027
<i>Lunch?</i>

734
00:43:04,102 --> 00:43:05,433
You're just gonna blow it?

735
00:43:05,504 --> 00:43:06,971
He's gonna blow it.

736
00:43:07,038 --> 00:43:10,872
<i>Your attitude stinks,
light my grundle, okay?</i>

737
00:43:10,942 --> 00:43:15,038
<i>Out of 10, I give him a big bad
zero. Zero, zero, zero.</i>

738
00:43:15,113 --> 00:43:16,978
Zero.

739
00:43:17,048 --> 00:43:18,106
That's great.

740
00:43:22,587 --> 00:43:23,918
Where are you going?

741
00:43:23,989 --> 00:43:26,719
Lunch with Erica's parents.

742
00:43:26,792 --> 00:43:28,419
Erica. Who's that?

743
00:43:28,493 --> 00:43:30,290
My girlfriend.

744
00:43:30,362 --> 00:43:32,455
<i>Oh, right.
The one you're moving in with.</i>

745
00:43:32,531 --> 00:43:34,192
How are they?

746
00:43:34,266 --> 00:43:36,496
Hm.

747
00:43:36,568 --> 00:43:38,627
Can l make a suggestion?

748
00:43:38,703 --> 00:43:39,795
Yeah.

749
00:43:39,871 --> 00:43:41,133
Lose the sweater.

750
00:43:41,206 --> 00:43:43,731
This sweater?

751
00:43:43,809 --> 00:43:45,504
lt's kind of cool out.

752
00:43:45,577 --> 00:43:49,069
<i>But that sweater isn't.
You should burn it.</i>

753
00:43:49,147 --> 00:43:51,843
Wow. Listen to you.

754
00:43:51,917 --> 00:43:55,250
l don't remember you being this
caustic when we were younger.

755
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:57,436
l think l prefer you forget just
about everything

756
00:43:57,437 --> 00:43:59,552
you remember about me.

757
00:43:59,624 --> 00:44:01,489
l actually have fond memories of you.

758
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:04,256
Some things l probably would
have done differently.

759
00:44:04,329 --> 00:44:05,853
Such as?

760
00:44:05,931 --> 00:44:07,728
Try harder.

761
00:44:07,799 --> 00:44:09,232
At what?

762
00:44:09,301 --> 00:44:11,531
You're really enjoying this,
aren't you?

763
00:44:11,603 --> 00:44:13,036
<i>No.</i>

764
00:44:13,104 --> 00:44:14,969
Go on.

765
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:17,600
<i>I think I probably would
have, just, you know,</i>

766
00:44:17,676 --> 00:44:19,701
maybe stood up for--

767
00:44:19,778 --> 00:44:22,303
What? Huh? What?

768
00:44:25,917 --> 00:44:27,942
Okay. Uh--

769
00:44:28,019 --> 00:44:31,750
<i>I think I should have
probably stood up for you</i>

770
00:44:31,823 --> 00:44:33,688
when kids were being mean.

771
00:44:33,758 --> 00:44:37,819
<i>Maybe sometimes the way Tyler
and I acted we enabled this whole--</i>

772
00:44:37,896 --> 00:44:39,488
Okay, you can stop.

773
00:44:39,564 --> 00:44:40,929
<i>It's good.</i>

774
00:44:40,999 --> 00:44:42,694
l was just getting started.

775
00:44:42,767 --> 00:44:45,759
l'll stop you before you say
something that'll make me cry.

776
00:44:45,837 --> 00:44:47,737
A tough girl like you?

777
00:44:49,074 --> 00:44:50,507
<i>Okay. Try this.</i>

778
00:44:50,575 --> 00:44:51,667
On top of this?

779
00:44:51,743 --> 00:44:53,574
On top of it.

780
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:03,246
l'm not even gonna ask.

781
00:45:03,321 --> 00:45:05,016
Disaster.

782
00:45:05,090 --> 00:45:06,785
l don't get it.

783
00:45:06,858 --> 00:45:08,621
You posted that on Craigslist?

784
00:45:08,693 --> 00:45:09,955
Of course.

785
00:45:10,028 --> 00:45:11,996
Did you post it
under housing section?

786
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:13,223
What housing section?

787
00:45:13,298 --> 00:45:14,629
The-- Housing section.

788
00:45:14,699 --> 00:45:16,291
There isn't a housing section.

00:46:51,696 --> 00:46:53,061
<i>Yes, you should.</i>

a little writing there, Kieran.</i>

839
00:47:44,382 --> 00:47:46,509
Yeah. And l'm still trying.

840
00:47:46,584 --> 00:47:49,052
Great. You think you might have
some more success

841
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:52,180
if the word ''commitment''
was in your lexicon?

842
00:47:52,257 --> 00:47:54,919

00:47:54,993 --> 00:47:57,860

lf not you think you might do the
decent thing and set her free?

846
00:48:03,001 --> 00:48:07,438
Set me free? What am l a wild
caged animal, trying to break free?

847
00:48:07,505 --> 00:48:11,032
Nicholas, l don't think we should
talk-- No caged animals in my house.

848
00:48:11,109 --> 00:48:13,168
When my hand's up like this,
l'm talking.

849
00:48:13,244 --> 00:48:16,372
<i>If you're not financially viable
to support a family,</i>

850
00:48:16,448 --> 00:48:18,678
you should think about
another line of work,

851
00:48:18,750 --> 00:48:21,514
<i>to have some room for
advancement as your family grows.</i>

852

He's a great writer.

853

<i>That's been discussed.
In the meantime,</i>

854
00:48:26,324 --> 00:48:28,849
<i>maybe you could come work
at my box factory, Boxes.</i>

855
00:48:28,927 --> 00:48:30,189
Oh.

856
00:48:30,261 --> 00:48:31,990
Oh. Hm.

857
00:48:32,063 --> 00:48:35,794
<i>Well, that's tempting,
but you know, I just--</i>

858
00:48:35,867 --> 00:48:38,301
Boxes aren't really my thing.

859
00:48:38,369 --> 00:48:41,964
You know, l used to be a socialist,
you know, Kieran?

860
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:44,008
And l realized there was
no money in it.

861
00:48:44,075 --> 00:48:47,704
<i>Call me crazy but I thought my life
would be better with a few dollars,</i>

a statistical analysis

<i>boxes weren't my thing,</i>

<i>but financial stability for my

00:48:58,656 --> 00:49:02,319
<i>Hi, you'all doing? I'm Kelly,
I'll be your server.</i>

no shrimp, no tortillas,</i>

873
00:49:14,539 --> 00:49:15,801
<i>she'll have a prime rib--</i>

874
00:49:15,874 --> 00:49:18,001
l haven't had meat in almost
seven years--

875
00:49:18,076 --> 00:49:21,011
You will tonight. He'll have the
pasta without any sauce.

876
00:49:21,079 --> 00:49:22,706
<i>I haven't looked at the menu yet.</i>

877
00:49:22,781 --> 00:49:24,772
You don't need to.
Put it in. We're fine.

878
00:49:24,849 --> 00:49:26,248
l definitely want sauce.

879
00:49:26,317 --> 00:49:30,276
lf l'm having pasta, sauce--
Can l get a drink?

880
00:49:30,355 --> 00:49:32,346
Mom, please don't cry.

881
00:49:32,423 --> 00:49:36,519
<i>I'm also the kind of guy that
likes to travel around a lot,</i>

882
00:49:36,594 --> 00:49:39,859
just can't stay in one place for
any amount of time.

883
00:49:39,931 --> 00:49:42,263
l studied Buddhism in Tibet

884
00:49:42,333 --> 00:49:45,791
but l got bored with that so l took
up some cooking lessons in Paris.

885
00:49:45,870 --> 00:49:48,600
l met this girl, we traveled
around northern Africa,

886
00:49:48,673 --> 00:49:52,803
where she fell in love with a
Moroccan prince so l was just--

887
00:49:52,877 --> 00:49:55,710
Off to Australia,
took up some surfing,

888
00:49:55,780 --> 00:49:59,511
but a buddy of mine got his leg
chopped off by a great white

889
00:49:59,584 --> 00:50:01,779
so not wanting to tempt
fate any further,

890
00:50:01,853 --> 00:50:05,755
l headed out and worked on an
Alaska oil rig for about six months,

891
00:50:05,824 --> 00:50:08,622
which was just as dangerous
but the pay was a lot better

892
00:50:08,693 --> 00:50:12,629
so with the cash l went to New York,
dabbled on some on line trading,

893
00:50:12,697 --> 00:50:15,689
made a gold mine on some
Tech stock hedge funds

894
00:50:15,767 --> 00:50:20,431
which l spent on a yacht which
sank off the coast of lndonesia.

895
00:50:23,575 --> 00:50:26,976
So, here I am.

896
00:50:27,045 --> 00:50:28,672
Yeah, well.

897
00:50:28,746 --> 00:50:31,340
l was on reality TV.

898
00:50:31,416 --> 00:50:33,247
And l won.

899
00:50:33,318 --> 00:50:37,687
<i>Maybe I'm not ready to get
married either, Mom.</i>

900
00:50:37,755 --> 00:50:41,247
<i>I got married before I was
drunk-- before I started to drink.</i>

901
00:50:41,326 --> 00:50:43,453
<i>You've been drinking ever since.</i>

902
00:50:43,528 --> 00:50:45,996
You are a condescential bitch!

903
00:50:46,064 --> 00:50:47,531
<i>That's not a word.</i>

904
00:50:47,599 --> 00:50:49,590
<i>Is too.</i>

905
00:50:49,667 --> 00:50:53,535
<i>So, does anybody ever
really get full from tapas?</i>

906
00:50:53,605 --> 00:50:55,072
Why is he here?

907
00:50:56,574 --> 00:50:58,371
<i>I was trying to be nice.</i>

908
00:50:58,443 --> 00:51:01,173
You know what?
l'm gonna take this.

909
00:51:01,246 --> 00:51:02,338
A call.

910
00:51:02,413 --> 00:51:03,641
That is rude, young man.

911
00:51:03,715 --> 00:51:05,410
Hello?

912
00:51:05,483 --> 00:51:08,213
<i>That's, that's crazy. Yeah,</i>

913
00:51:08,286 --> 00:51:10,777
<i>don't panic, uh, just stay there.</i>

914
00:51:10,855 --> 00:51:12,379
and l'll come get you.

915
00:51:12,457 --> 00:51:15,551
What the hell are you doing?

916
00:51:15,627 --> 00:51:18,255
l'm sorry, l have to leave.

917
00:51:18,329 --> 00:51:19,728
<i>What?</i>

918
00:51:19,797 --> 00:51:22,857
Yes, uh, it's uh, Trista, Tyler's

919
00:51:22,934 --> 00:51:25,459
awkward, boyish little sister

920
00:51:25,536 --> 00:51:28,437
<i>and, uh, she got lost downtown,</i>

921
00:51:28,506 --> 00:51:30,337
Who goes downtown anymore?

922
00:51:30,408 --> 00:51:31,773
Hookers.

923
00:51:31,843 --> 00:51:33,105
How do you know?

924
00:51:33,177 --> 00:51:36,442
No. She's just--

925
00:51:36,514 --> 00:51:39,972
<i>She's lost and she's panicking,
so I'm just gonna go.</i>

926
00:51:40,051 --> 00:51:41,541
<i>Why can't she just--</i>

927
00:51:41,619 --> 00:51:43,382
Loved the meal.

928
00:51:43,454 --> 00:51:45,081
l love that kid.

929
00:51:50,528 --> 00:51:52,655
Hey, baby. You come here often?

930
00:51:53,798 --> 00:51:55,356
What's going on? Are you okay?

931
00:51:55,433 --> 00:51:56,695
<i>I'm fine.</i>

932
00:51:56,768 --> 00:51:59,032
<i>No, not really. What's up?</i>

933
00:51:59,103 --> 00:52:00,627
No, it's stupid.

934
00:52:00,705 --> 00:52:04,300
Come on, lay it on me.
l promise l'll try not to laugh.

935
00:52:06,644 --> 00:52:09,204
<i>It's just--</i>

936
00:52:10,682 --> 00:52:12,206
lt's just fucking Tyler!

937
00:52:12,283 --> 00:52:14,649
l've come here to see him before
going to Europe

938
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:17,415
for l don't even know how long
and he can't find the time

939
00:52:17,488 --> 00:52:19,718
to even have a crappy lunch with me.

940
00:52:19,791 --> 00:52:23,158
Same shit all my life, Tyler, Tyler,
Tyler, and l'm sick of it.

941
00:52:23,227 --> 00:52:26,663
<i>And I hate the fact that I even
care when he so obviously doesn't.</i>

942
00:52:28,967 --> 00:52:32,960
Wow. l need whiskey.

943
00:52:33,037 --> 00:52:35,733
<i>He'd go out and I'd sneak
into his closet</i>

944
00:52:35,807 --> 00:52:37,775
<i>and I would steal his cowboy boots.</i>

945
00:52:37,842 --> 00:52:40,402
Remember those ones he used
to love so much?

946
00:52:40,478 --> 00:52:43,675
Of course. How could l forget them,
the red and blue ones?

947
00:52:43,748 --> 00:52:45,682
Red and teal. Right?

948
00:52:45,750 --> 00:52:47,183
Oh, excuse me.

949
00:52:47,251 --> 00:52:49,742
So you remember how anal he
was about them, right?

950
00:52:49,821 --> 00:52:52,790
<i>So I would sneak in there,
take them out, put them on,</i>

951
00:52:52,857 --> 00:52:56,850
and l would run around the house
in these giant oversized boots.

952
00:52:56,928 --> 00:53:01,956
And l'd be so happy just to be
wearing something of his.

953
00:53:02,033 --> 00:53:05,025
Then of course l always had to
sneak them back into his closet

954
00:53:05,103 --> 00:53:07,901
before he got home because
he'd flip out if he ever knew.

955
00:53:07,972 --> 00:53:11,339
l guess it's just kind of been our
deal, you know?

956
00:53:11,409 --> 00:53:15,641
<i>Me always trying to get
his attention.</i>

957
00:53:15,713 --> 00:53:18,739
You know, l actually thought
this trip would be different.

958
00:53:18,816 --> 00:53:21,478
l thought maybe
he'd finally notice me.

959
00:53:21,552 --> 00:53:25,648
<i>But, same old invisible girl.</i>

960
00:53:32,964 --> 00:53:34,556
Thanks.

961
00:53:34,632 --> 00:53:37,465
No, thanks. You totally saved me
from a miserable meal.

962
00:53:37,535 --> 00:53:39,526
How'd you know to do that?

963
00:53:39,604 --> 00:53:40,969
Gut feeling.

964
00:53:41,039 --> 00:53:42,529
Oh. lt's quite a gut.

965
00:53:45,443 --> 00:53:46,910
Oh, my-- Oh, my God.

966
00:53:46,978 --> 00:53:48,536
lt's unsightly, isn't it?

967
00:53:48,613 --> 00:53:51,411
lt really is. lt's disgusting,
you should put it away,

968
00:53:51,482 --> 00:53:55,145
and maybe think about doing
some crunches or something.

969
00:53:56,821 --> 00:53:58,083
Hit me.

970
00:53:58,156 --> 00:53:59,282
What?

971
00:53:59,357 --> 00:54:00,756
Go on, punch me.

972
00:54:00,825 --> 00:54:02,554
No, l'm not gonna--

973
00:54:04,662 --> 00:54:08,894
l want you to hit me
as hard as you can.

974
00:54:08,966 --> 00:54:12,402
Nice. That was nice. lt took me
a minute but l got it.

975
00:54:12,470 --> 00:54:13,300
Oh!

976
00:54:14,739 --> 00:54:16,172
Oh, Jesus. Sh.

977
00:54:17,442 --> 00:54:18,909
l'll just leave that here.

978
00:54:18,976 --> 00:54:21,740
l don't even know if Tyler's been
in this room, so.

979
00:54:21,813 --> 00:54:24,577
<i>So I said to the guy, I thought
I told you to duck?</i>

980
00:54:24,649 --> 00:54:28,141
<i>And he goes, ''Oh, I though
you meant the one in the pond.''</i>

981
00:54:30,888 --> 00:54:32,617
<i>Stinker.</i>

982
00:54:32,690 --> 00:54:34,920
Hey, who's the, uh, cute couple?

983
00:54:34,992 --> 00:54:37,119
<i>Oh, no, we're just friends.</i>

984
00:54:37,195 --> 00:54:38,062
Don't worry about them, Barry.

985
00:54:38,063 --> 00:54:41,529
That's just my ex friend
and my little sister

986
00:54:41,599 --> 00:54:43,226
but this is a fantastic martini.

987
00:54:43,301 --> 00:54:47,601
Really? Alright.
l , l honestly, wasn't--

988
00:54:47,672 --> 00:54:49,299
Trista.

989
00:54:56,914 --> 00:54:59,246
So, uh, Bar,

990
00:54:59,317 --> 00:55:00,375
to new roommates.

991
00:55:00,451 --> 00:55:02,282
Yeah, new roommates.

992
00:55:02,353 --> 00:55:04,583
Cheers. Are you moving in tonight?

993
00:55:04,655 --> 00:55:05,952
Tonight?

994
00:55:06,023 --> 00:55:07,581
<i>Yeah.</i>

995
00:55:07,658 --> 00:55:09,353
l mean, l could.

996
00:55:09,427 --> 00:55:10,826
Man, this is good.

997
00:56:50,661 --> 00:56:53,630
<i>No, Lisa.
The girl's here for Heath.</i>

998
00:56:53,698 --> 00:56:56,098
She thought that his room
was my room.

999
00:56:56,167 --> 00:56:57,828
Would l lie to you?

1000
00:56:57,902 --> 00:56:59,767
No way.

1001
00:56:59,837 --> 00:57:02,237
Not-- Convince you that--
Hang on.

1002
00:57:02,306 --> 00:57:05,275
Hey, you want to spend a little
QT with your brother today?

1003
00:57:05,343 --> 00:57:06,708
l'll get my purse.

1004
00:57:06,777 --> 00:57:08,267
Hey, what's in the envelope?

1005
00:57:08,346 --> 00:57:09,745
Nothing.

1006
00:57:09,814 --> 00:57:11,509
That's my sister.

1007
00:57:22,727 --> 00:57:25,025
See? lf we get in now, we can sell

1008
00:57:25,096 --> 00:57:27,121
and make a profit
in less than two yeras.

1009
00:57:27,198 --> 00:57:29,189
We'll make money
off the bank's money,

1010
00:57:29,267 --> 00:57:32,862
which will enable us to move
up to a bigger place.

1011
00:57:37,608 --> 00:57:38,632
You made a pie chart.

1012
00:57:38,709 --> 00:57:41,405
Yeah.

1013
00:57:44,181 --> 00:57:47,947
<i>Listen, thank you so much for lunch,
I really appreciate it.</i>

1014
00:57:48,019 --> 00:57:49,509
You're welcome.

1015
00:57:49,587 --> 00:57:51,316
So you live here?

1016
00:57:51,389 --> 00:57:53,380
Uh, yeah, for the time being.

1017
00:57:53,457 --> 00:57:57,416
l mean, it's, you know,
sort of a crash pad.

1018
00:57:57,495 --> 00:58:00,931
<i>It does the trick.</i>

1019
00:58:00,998 --> 00:58:05,867
And how exactly do you afford
this on a nurse's salary?

1020
00:58:07,938 --> 00:58:09,929
<i>This wasn't as bad as I thought.</i>

1021
00:58:10,007 --> 00:58:11,167
No?

1022
00:58:11,242 --> 00:58:13,836
Definitely not as bad as l thought.

1023
00:58:13,911 --> 00:58:17,347
l mean, lunch, was a little,
hm, spotty.

1024
00:58:17,415 --> 00:58:21,545
And you're kind of cute,
you know that?

1025
00:58:21,619 --> 00:58:23,348
l did not know that, no.

1026
00:58:23,421 --> 00:58:27,323
Charming, l knew, but cute?
l don't know.

1027
00:58:27,391 --> 00:58:28,688
l'll take it.

1028
00:58:28,759 --> 00:58:31,250
You're not so bad yourself,
you know?

1029
00:58:31,329 --> 00:58:34,230
Except for the fact that you're
a heartless workaholic.

1030
00:58:34,298 --> 00:58:36,027
Yeah.

1031
00:58:36,100 --> 00:58:38,700
You know underneath
this hard exterior,

1032
00:58:38,701 --> 00:58:41,299
yours is a pretty big heart.

1033
00:58:41,372 --> 00:58:44,068
Well, l've noticed
that you're a good nurse.

1034
00:58:44,141 --> 00:58:45,699
Thank you.

1035
00:58:45,776 --> 00:58:49,837
And you're smart,
work well with children.

1036
00:58:49,914 --> 00:58:53,315
l mean, l get a lot of practice
being around here.

1037
00:58:59,290 --> 00:59:01,281
What was that for?

1038
00:59:01,359 --> 00:59:03,054
So now you're an idiot.

1039
00:59:03,127 --> 00:59:05,721
Not really am l?

1040
00:59:05,796 --> 00:59:08,162
Yeah, a little bit.

1041
00:59:08,232 --> 00:59:12,464
<i>Okay, I'll be here early in the
morning to help you pack. Alright?</i>

1042
00:59:12,536 --> 00:59:13,696
l love you-- Daddy, hi!

1043
00:59:13,771 --> 00:59:15,762
<i>You'll never believe this.</i>

1044
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:19,003
<i>We found the most adorable place,
we're moving in together.</i>

1045
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:25,578
Oh, hey, Bar.
Yeah, last night was...

1046
00:59:25,579 --> 00:59:27,876
the most fun l've ever
had in my life.

1047
00:59:27,952 --> 00:59:30,785
Yeah, no, l can't wait until you
move in here.

1048
00:59:30,855 --> 00:59:34,313
<i>Yeah, that's fantastic. Tonight?</i>

1049
00:59:34,392 --> 00:59:36,883
<i>Let me call you back.</i>

1050
00:59:40,297 --> 00:59:41,355
What?

1051
00:59:41,432 --> 00:59:42,524
lt's not working.

1052
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:43,931
What?

1053
00:59:44,001 --> 00:59:46,469
The whole Barry thing
is not making me jealous.

1054
00:59:46,537 --> 00:59:48,562
Not everything is about you, Kieran.

1055
00:59:48,639 --> 00:59:50,471
Buzz McManus is coming
here right now, to interview me,

1056
00:59:50,472 --> 00:59:52,302
in my penthouse.

1057
00:59:52,376 --> 00:59:54,708
You know the one
you're living in for free?

1058
00:59:54,779 --> 00:59:56,974
<i>Figure it out!</i>

1059
01:00:21,005 --> 01:00:24,771
<i>Welcome to another edition of
Living Large with me, Buzz McManus,</i>

1060
01:00:24,842 --> 01:00:27,037
where we see the beautiful
and the blessed.

1061
01:00:27,111 --> 01:00:31,104
And today we will be doing the
penthouse of That Tyler.

1062
01:00:31,182 --> 01:00:34,515
<i>Is life better as a celebrity
without any actual talents?</i>

1063
01:00:34,585 --> 01:00:35,813
Well, yeah.

1064
01:00:35,886 --> 01:00:39,447
Well, fantastic!
So here is your foyer.

1065
01:00:41,659 --> 01:00:45,220
<i>And over there the TV
set of the Strangers.</i>

1066
01:00:45,296 --> 01:00:48,163
<i>Yeah, actually, we love
to throw this around.</i>

1067
01:00:48,232 --> 01:00:49,462
Does it ever bother you to be an

1068
01:00:49,463 --> 01:00:52,692
integral part of the
downfall of America?

1069
01:00:59,243 --> 01:01:00,904
<i>What do we have here?</i>

1070
01:01:02,713 --> 01:01:04,271
Thank you.

1071
01:01:04,348 --> 01:01:06,839
<i>God! What the fuck
are you doing here?</i>

1072
01:01:06,917 --> 01:01:11,286
<i>We all remember Lexi,
That's girlfriend from Strangers.</i>

1073
01:01:14,391 --> 01:01:16,291
How are doing?

1074
01:01:16,360 --> 01:01:19,454
Great, Buzz. Ever since Tyler's
moved his school buddies in

1075
01:01:19,530 --> 01:01:20,428
<i>instead of me--</i>

1076
01:01:20,498 --> 01:01:21,897
That's called loyalty.

1077
01:01:24,001 --> 01:01:26,128
That's called immaturity and fear.

1078
01:01:26,203 --> 01:01:28,171
My therapist has you pegged.

1079
01:01:28,239 --> 01:01:30,173
Has he pegged you yet?

1080
01:01:30,241 --> 01:01:33,870
<i>That's none of your business. None
of this is your business anymore.</i>

1081
01:01:33,944 --> 01:01:36,777
<i>Oh, that's your book? How's
your 15 minutes of fame going?</i>

1082
01:01:36,847 --> 01:01:38,109
How's your five?

1083
01:01:38,182 --> 01:01:40,275
He calls his unit, Gizmo.

1084
01:01:40,351 --> 01:01:41,545
She has lBS.

1085
01:01:41,619 --> 01:01:44,144
Tyler shaves his asshole!

1086
01:01:44,221 --> 01:01:45,449
No. Brrr. No. Stop.

1087
01:01:45,523 --> 01:01:46,581
Can we move on?

1088
01:01:46,657 --> 01:01:48,284
We move on.

1089
01:01:48,359 --> 01:01:50,657
<i>Shaving his asshole.
Fucking loser!</i>

1090
01:01:50,728 --> 01:01:52,218
That was for your birthday.

1091
01:01:52,296 --> 01:01:54,628
<i>So are we done here,
shall we go?</i>

1092
01:01:54,698 --> 01:01:57,189
No, actually, we got my boy Heath.

1093
01:01:57,268 --> 01:02:01,204
Oh, l don't know what the fuck
this shit is.

1094
01:02:01,272 --> 01:02:03,502
lt's all good. Stop, buddy.

1095
01:02:03,574 --> 01:02:05,405
Oh, shit!

1096
01:02:05,476 --> 01:02:06,807
Oh, my God, bro!

1097
01:02:06,877 --> 01:02:08,811
Get the fuck out!

1098
01:02:08,879 --> 01:02:11,211
<i>Will you get the fuck outta
here, man?</i>

1099
01:02:11,282 --> 01:02:12,840
lt looks like the doctor is in.

1100
01:02:12,917 --> 01:02:14,009
l'm so sorry.

1101
01:02:14,084 --> 01:02:15,779
How was l supposed to know?

1102
01:02:15,853 --> 01:02:18,617
l got the fucking barricade,
you fucking idiot!

1103
01:02:18,689 --> 01:02:19,713
l'm sorry.

1104
01:02:19,790 --> 01:02:21,485
lt's huge!

1105
01:02:21,559 --> 01:02:23,789
This has happened to me and
Tyler many times.

1106
01:02:23,861 --> 01:02:25,658
<i>Get the fuck outta here!</i>

1107
01:02:25,729 --> 01:02:29,221
l'm sorry, man. How was l supposed
to know you'd be diddling your nurse?

1108
01:02:29,300 --> 01:02:33,100
Actually, l'm the doctor.
He's the nurse.

1109
01:02:33,170 --> 01:02:34,228
Shit.

1110
01:02:34,305 --> 01:02:36,899
She's-- You're not a doctor?

1111
01:02:36,974 --> 01:02:40,273
<i>Fuck! Get the fuck out!</i>

1112
01:03:21,619 --> 01:03:23,780
<i>Why did you write this?</i>

1113
01:03:25,856 --> 01:03:27,483
Uh, l don't know.

1114
01:03:27,558 --> 01:03:29,526
'Cause l wanted to.

1115
01:03:29,593 --> 01:03:31,458
<i>Sorry, is that--</i>

1116
01:03:31,528 --> 01:03:32,790
So you're leaving?

1117
01:03:35,132 --> 01:03:37,293
Yeah, l need to.

1118
01:03:37,368 --> 01:03:40,929
This place--
This place just isn't me.

1119
01:03:41,005 --> 01:03:43,371
Moving in with Erica?

1120
01:03:44,942 --> 01:03:46,807
l don't think so.

1121
01:03:48,746 --> 01:03:50,338
So where are you going?

1122
01:03:50,414 --> 01:03:52,348
Uh, l don't know.

1123
01:03:54,018 --> 01:03:56,043
Just-- What about you?

1124
01:03:56,120 --> 01:03:57,553
What are you-- Are you?

1125
01:04:01,992 --> 01:04:04,460
You didn't like the story?

1126
01:04:35,592 --> 01:04:38,356
l just don't get it, Barry.
You know?

1127
01:04:38,429 --> 01:04:42,160
l mean, how did everything
get so effing fucked?

1128
01:04:45,335 --> 01:04:48,896
You know, l was on an excavation
on the Sahara

1129
01:04:48,972 --> 01:04:50,906
and l spent some
time with a Bedouin.

1130
01:04:52,476 --> 01:04:54,444
Anyhow, they, uh,

1131
01:04:54,511 --> 01:04:56,672
had a saying.

1132
01:04:56,747 --> 01:05:00,911
The hardest tool was
the softly spoken phrase.

1133
01:05:00,984 --> 01:05:03,248
l'm sorry.

1134
01:05:06,957 --> 01:05:11,690
Dude, you have the ability to unfuck
that which has been fucked.

1135
01:05:19,837 --> 01:05:21,600
ldiot.

1136
01:05:21,672 --> 01:05:24,266
<i>The semester starts in February.</i>

1137
01:05:24,341 --> 01:05:28,277
<i>and it runs into mid June so
I'll be in Paris until then.</i>

1138
01:05:28,345 --> 01:05:32,008
<i>Then I'm going to go to Barcelona,</i>

1139
01:05:34,852 --> 01:05:36,046
<i>Rome--</i>

1140
01:05:36,120 --> 01:05:38,020
Don't even know where you're going.

1141
01:05:38,088 --> 01:05:39,248
<i>Prague.</i>

1142
01:05:39,323 --> 01:05:41,120
You're going to Europe by yourself.

1143
01:05:41,191 --> 01:05:43,352
Maybe but l have a roommate
there already.

1144
01:05:43,427 --> 01:05:46,396
We're gonna travel together. Yeah.

1145
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:51,626
Of course, there's always
room for one more.

1146
01:05:51,702 --> 01:05:53,795
Wow.

1147
01:05:53,871 --> 01:05:56,897
l don't know. l don't think so.

1148
01:05:56,974 --> 01:06:00,000
Come on. We could do all kinds
of crazy stuff together.

1149
01:06:00,077 --> 01:06:02,545
You could write about it.

1150
01:06:02,613 --> 01:06:04,774
A bath could be involved.

1151
01:06:04,848 --> 01:06:06,782
Oh. You want to take a bath?

1152
01:06:06,850 --> 01:06:09,011
You want to join me?

1153
01:06:13,690 --> 01:06:16,818
l-- l-- uh--

1154
01:06:23,867 --> 01:06:26,028
Erica.

1155
01:06:26,103 --> 01:06:29,800
<i>Thanks a lot , man I mean, you
don't have to apologize to me, bro.</i>

1156
01:06:29,873 --> 01:06:33,036
No, l do. l do have to apologize

1157
01:06:33,110 --> 01:06:36,102
because l was in the wrong.

1158
01:06:36,180 --> 01:06:38,375
l'm sorry you had to see me
in that position.

1159
01:06:38,448 --> 01:06:40,006
Cheers.

1160
01:06:40,083 --> 01:06:42,244
Erica, wait a minute.

1161
01:06:42,319 --> 01:06:44,253
Stop it! Go away!

1162
01:06:44,321 --> 01:06:46,118
Don't walk away, please.

1163
01:06:46,190 --> 01:06:47,936
Get the fuck off of me!
How could you,

1164
01:06:47,937 --> 01:06:49,682
you lying cheating piece of shit!

1165
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:50,749
How could you?

1166
01:06:50,828 --> 01:06:52,056
lt's not what you think.

1167
01:06:52,129 --> 01:06:54,324
Oh, thank God it's not what l think

1168
01:06:54,398 --> 01:06:57,390
<i>because I just walked in on you,
naked in bed with some slut!</i>

1169
01:06:57,467 --> 01:06:58,661
He finally got laid!

1170
01:06:58,735 --> 01:07:01,329
Please, let's go somewhere--

1171
01:07:01,405 --> 01:07:04,203
Jesus, he actually does have
a pretty big cock.

1172
01:07:05,576 --> 01:07:08,067
l think it was inside
your sister, bro.

1173
01:07:10,614 --> 01:07:12,013
My sister? My--

1174
01:07:12,082 --> 01:07:14,243
<i>My sister! You fucking
touched my sister?</i>

1175
01:07:14,318 --> 01:07:15,410
l'll kill you!

1176
01:07:15,485 --> 01:07:16,611
Whoa, whoa, wait.

1177
01:07:16,687 --> 01:07:17,711
Oh.

1178
01:07:17,788 --> 01:07:18,982
<i>Right there.</i>

1179
01:07:19,056 --> 01:07:20,387
Tyler's sister?

1180
01:07:20,457 --> 01:07:22,049
l'm good, l'm good.

1181
01:07:22,125 --> 01:07:23,649
You fucked with--

1182
01:07:23,727 --> 01:07:26,821
The awkward, boyish sister?

1183
01:07:26,897 --> 01:07:28,296
Let me explain.

1184
01:07:28,365 --> 01:07:29,832
Ugh!

1185
01:07:29,900 --> 01:07:32,494
That's just cutting the circulation
off the brain.

1186
01:07:32,569 --> 01:07:33,934
Fucking crazy.

1187
01:07:34,004 --> 01:07:36,063
<i>Heath, just help a little.</i>

1188
01:07:38,475 --> 01:07:42,309
<i>I know it's kind of a short notice,
I just decided that I was going--</i>

1189
01:07:42,379 --> 01:07:43,573
Hey.

1190
01:07:43,647 --> 01:07:45,171
<i>Waiting like I was normally--</i>

1191
01:07:45,249 --> 01:07:46,580
Can l talk to you?

1192
01:07:46,650 --> 01:07:47,912
<i>I'm on the phone, Kieran.</i>

1193
01:07:47,985 --> 01:07:50,180
Okay, uh, this is important.

1194
01:07:50,254 --> 01:07:53,746
Can l call you back?

1195
01:07:55,792 --> 01:07:57,123
What do you want?

1196
01:07:59,263 --> 01:08:00,992
l just wanted to say that--

1197
01:08:01,064 --> 01:08:03,294
What do you want to say, Kieran?

1198
01:08:06,570 --> 01:08:09,437
l just wanted to tell you l'm--

1199
01:08:15,045 --> 01:08:16,945
Are you leaving?

1200
01:08:17,014 --> 01:08:19,949
No big shocker, huh?
l can't imagine

1201
01:08:20,017 --> 01:08:22,247
why l'd want to leave this
place. Right?

1202
01:08:22,319 --> 01:08:26,449
You know, l , l couldn't figure out
why you wanted to live here.

1203
01:08:26,523 --> 01:08:30,550
And l didn't think you had it in you.
You know, l was wrong.

1204
01:08:30,627 --> 01:08:34,586
<i>Because you know what? You and
my brother, you deserve each other.</i>

1205
01:08:37,501 --> 01:08:38,593
Trista. Come on.

1206
01:08:47,444 --> 01:08:49,469
<i>I'm fine, though. Okay, Barry?</i>

1207
01:08:49,546 --> 01:08:50,638
Okay. You ready?

1208
01:08:50,714 --> 01:08:52,682
Yeah, l'm good. Ah! Fuck!

1209
01:08:52,749 --> 01:08:54,216
Jesus!

1210
01:08:54,284 --> 01:08:55,979
lt relieves the pressure points.

1211
01:08:56,053 --> 01:08:58,146
Get off. l told you l'm okay.

1212
01:09:03,760 --> 01:09:06,558
l'm gonna fucking kill you,
sister fucker.

1213
01:09:06,630 --> 01:09:08,928
<i>Oh, I can't even look at you
right now.</i>

1214
01:09:08,999 --> 01:09:10,864
Oh, is it that terrible, Tyler?

1215
01:09:10,934 --> 01:09:13,232
Yeah, it is that terrible, Trista.

1216
01:09:13,303 --> 01:09:15,134
lt's not like l never had sex before.

1217
01:09:15,205 --> 01:09:16,695
You didn't have sex before.

1218
01:09:16,773 --> 01:09:17,933
A guy penetrated me.

1219
01:09:18,008 --> 01:09:19,942
Don't. No-- Nobody's penetrated you.

1220
01:09:20,010 --> 01:09:23,104
<i>I gave blow jobs, yeah,
lots of them,</i>

1221
01:09:23,180 --> 01:09:25,410
good ones, swallowing, big, fat, oh!

1222
01:09:25,482 --> 01:09:26,642
<i>You're not doing that.</i>

1223
01:09:26,717 --> 01:09:27,979
<i>I won an award in college.</i>

1224
01:09:28,051 --> 01:09:29,678
They don't give awards for that.

1225
01:09:29,753 --> 01:09:30,981
As a matter of fact--

1226
01:09:31,054 --> 01:09:33,147
There's something you
don't know about me

1227
01:09:33,223 --> 01:09:35,157
<i>but I love having my brains
fucked out!</i>

1228
01:09:35,225 --> 01:09:37,591
Threesomes, foursomes,
orgies, gang bangs--

1229
01:09:37,661 --> 01:09:40,027
l told you not to hang out
with Betty, that slut!

1230
01:09:40,097 --> 01:09:42,497
Missionary, a lot of doggie--

1231
01:09:42,566 --> 01:09:43,726
Cow girl.

1232
01:09:43,800 --> 01:09:45,734
The gun? What are you doing--

1233
01:09:45,802 --> 01:09:46,826
Daisy chains.

1234
01:09:46,903 --> 01:09:48,234
There's no fucking--

1235
01:09:48,305 --> 01:09:50,466
Yeah, there's lots of them.

1236
01:09:50,540 --> 01:09:52,940
<i>You ever heard of a hot Carl?</i>

1237
01:09:53,010 --> 01:09:54,705
What the fuck is that?

1238
01:09:59,282 --> 01:10:02,410
<i>You didn't-- You didn't really
do all that, did you?</i>

1239
01:10:04,388 --> 01:10:05,514
No, Heath.

1240
01:10:05,589 --> 01:10:07,420
Yeah.

1241
01:10:07,491 --> 01:10:09,049
<i>How about some Couscous?</i>

1242
01:10:09,126 --> 01:10:10,184
Alright, man.

1243
01:10:10,260 --> 01:10:11,727
Yeah.

1244
01:10:11,795 --> 01:10:13,854
<i>Couscous. What the fuck is that?</i>

1245
01:10:18,402 --> 01:10:19,994
<i>Come out of your room.</i>

1246
01:10:20,070 --> 01:10:23,403
Remember when l burned your
Barbies? You forgave me for that.

1247
01:10:25,442 --> 01:10:27,877
Come on.
l'll take you to one of those

1248
01:10:27,878 --> 01:10:30,311
shitty romantic comedies you like.

1249
01:10:30,380 --> 01:10:34,407
Please, come out.
What are you doing in there?

1250
01:10:34,484 --> 01:10:36,509
You're by yourself, right?

1251
01:10:39,256 --> 01:10:42,657
l'm sorry.

1252
01:10:42,726 --> 01:10:45,178
<i>I need a ride to the airport tonight.</i>

1253
01:10:45,179 --> 01:10:47,629
Are you taking me or should
I call a cab?

1254
01:10:47,697 --> 01:10:50,928
What time? There's traffic-- Okay,
okay, l'll take you.

1255
01:11:00,043 --> 01:11:02,307
Jesus Christ.

1256
01:11:05,549 --> 01:11:08,416
Hey, Mitra. lt's, uh, it's Heath.

1257
01:11:08,485 --> 01:11:10,680
Heath the nurse. Ha.

1258
01:11:10,754 --> 01:11:15,384
Uh, uh, l'm just calling,
l guess to apologize.

1259
01:11:17,260 --> 01:11:22,095
l don't know, l wrote down this list

1260
01:11:22,165 --> 01:11:25,100
about things that suck about Heath.

1261
01:11:25,168 --> 01:11:29,798
<i>Sorry. Sorry for being
fucking stupid.</i>

1262
01:11:29,873 --> 01:11:33,309
Sorry for embarrassing you,
l'm just being honest.

1263
01:11:33,376 --> 01:11:36,311
l'm still trying to be funny,
l'll still be nice to you.

1264
01:11:36,379 --> 01:11:39,246
l'll cuddle you if you could
forgive me or something.

1265
01:11:39,316 --> 01:11:42,945
Sucks!  l was in there.

1266
01:11:43,019 --> 01:11:45,351
Just call me back, l don't know.

1267
01:11:45,422 --> 01:11:47,652
l'll try not to fuck up again.

1268
01:12:06,743 --> 01:12:10,179
Wow. Of all the places
l never thought l'd see you.

1269
01:12:10,247 --> 01:12:12,511
Surprised?

1270
01:12:12,582 --> 01:12:15,813
ln more ways than one, Kieran.

1271
01:12:19,022 --> 01:12:21,252
You've every right to hate me.

1272
01:12:21,324 --> 01:12:23,315
<i>No, I don't hate you.</i>

1273
01:12:23,393 --> 01:12:25,691
Truth is 30 years from now l don't

1274
01:12:25,692 --> 01:12:27,989
want to end up like my mother
and father either.

1275
01:12:30,100 --> 01:12:32,330
<i>I should have had out of this
a long time ago.</i>

1276
01:12:32,402 --> 01:12:36,862
l know that you wanted to
it's just, l really thought that--

1277
01:12:42,312 --> 01:12:44,746
<i>Just, uh, watch out for the coyotes.</i>

1278
01:13:12,375 --> 01:13:14,002
Whoa, look.

1279
01:13:14,077 --> 01:13:17,012
No, you look! l've had a massive
crush on him since l was 14!

1280
01:13:17,080 --> 01:13:19,014
What? Shut up.

1281
01:13:19,082 --> 01:13:20,362
He wasn't the self-centered
prick of an older brother

1282
01:13:20,363 --> 01:13:23,041
who never had time for me.
He was a sweet guy.

1283
01:13:23,119 --> 01:13:25,417
You know what, 
he actually acted like I existed.

1284
01:13:25,488 --> 01:13:27,513
He's dead to me.
l am not self-centered.

1285
01:13:27,591 --> 01:13:30,219
<i>Look, we're hanging out
right now, aren't we?</i>

1286
01:13:30,293 --> 01:13:33,558
Yeah, feel the love.

1287
01:13:35,065 --> 01:13:36,362
<i>Why are we slowing down?</i>

1288
01:13:39,436 --> 01:13:41,028
l just gotta go inside for a bit.

1289
01:13:41,104 --> 01:13:42,867
<i>I'll get them to comp you a drink.</i>

1290
01:13:44,341 --> 01:13:46,070
<i>What?</i>

1291
01:13:46,142 --> 01:13:48,804
<i>If you go in there, I'm won't
be here when you get back.</i>

1292
01:13:48,878 --> 01:13:51,676
Come on, Trish, you know l have
to do this kind of stuff.

1293
01:13:51,748 --> 01:13:54,012
l'm not coming back.

1294
01:13:54,084 --> 01:13:55,642
Ever.

1295
01:13:55,719 --> 01:13:56,879
Two minutes.

1296
01:13:56,953 --> 01:13:58,318
Sure, Tyler.

1297
01:13:58,388 --> 01:14:01,949
Five minutes. Just turn this
and lock your door.

1298
01:14:10,100 --> 01:14:12,193
l called his agent an hour ago.
An hour ago!

1299
01:14:12,269 --> 01:14:14,260
He's still not here!
l don't believe it!

1300
01:14:14,337 --> 01:14:15,770
Hey, Tyler!

1301
01:14:15,839 --> 01:14:17,431
Who are you?

1302
01:14:17,507 --> 01:14:19,975
Mike Profit, from Profit Promotions.

1303
01:14:20,043 --> 01:14:21,635
How're you doing?

1304
01:14:21,711 --> 01:14:23,770
<i>I got you set up in VIP,
bottle on the house</i>

1305
01:14:23,847 --> 01:14:26,680
<i>We got you scheduled for two
hours, 30 minutes of photos,</i>

1306
01:14:26,750 --> 01:14:29,116
<i>hanging out, make it seem
as natural as you can.</i>

1307
01:14:29,185 --> 01:14:31,483
Then Alejandra,
the Putas Locas producer

1308
01:14:31,554 --> 01:14:34,387
she's gonna get you geared off with

1309
01:14:34,388 --> 01:14:37,220
the camera and set you loose 
on the audience,

1310
01:14:37,294 --> 01:14:40,320
He'll brief you, but you've seen
the videos, ask them their name,

1311
01:14:40,397 --> 01:14:42,365
free T shits for titties out, 
50 bucks for dyking

1312
01:14:42,366 --> 01:14:44,333
in the bathroom and bla bla bla

1313
01:14:44,401 --> 01:14:45,993
and all that funny stuff, okay?

1314
01:14:46,069 --> 01:14:47,366
There you go. Enjoy.

1315
01:15:20,503 --> 01:15:21,902
<i>Is there a problem?</i>

1316
01:15:21,971 --> 01:15:23,836
<i>Yeah, I can't really do this.</i>

1317
01:15:23,907 --> 01:15:26,307
<i>Man, this isn't my shit anymore.</i>

1318
01:16:40,417 --> 01:16:42,817
Seat taken?

1319
01:16:44,687 --> 01:16:46,552
Barry, how did you find me?

1320
01:16:46,623 --> 01:16:49,717
Bro, l spent eight months tracking
cheetahs in the Serengeti.

1321
01:16:49,793 --> 01:16:53,661
l think l can find a 150 pound white
dude on the top of a mountain.

1322
01:16:53,730 --> 01:16:56,096
<i>So how are you holding up?</i>

1323
01:16:56,166 --> 01:16:58,225
Well, let's see, uh,

1324
01:16:59,602 --> 01:17:01,661
My friends hate me,

1325
01:17:01,738 --> 01:17:06,038
the girl that l never loved but
was gonna move in with

1326
01:17:06,109 --> 01:17:08,737
<i>left me, understandably.</i>

1327
01:17:08,812 --> 01:17:11,042
And the girl that l do love

1328
01:17:11,114 --> 01:17:12,513
wants to leave me.

1329
01:17:12,582 --> 01:17:15,813
Actually, she already left.

1330
01:17:15,885 --> 01:17:17,853
<i>There you have it.</i>

1331
01:17:17,921 --> 01:17:21,084
But, hey, l'm still writing. Right?

1332
01:17:21,157 --> 01:17:24,593
Pumping out my terrible reviews

1333
01:17:24,661 --> 01:17:28,654
<i>of mind numbing,
suicide inducing Muzak</i>

1334
01:17:28,731 --> 01:17:31,183
l'll tell you what.
l have a buddy of mine. He runs...

1335
01:17:31,184 --> 01:17:33,634
a pop culture mag in Hollywood.

1336
01:17:33,703 --> 01:17:35,796
<i>I'm sure he can always
use a smart reviewer.</i>

1337
01:17:35,872 --> 01:17:38,170
Yeah, music, books, movies,
stuff like that.

1338
01:17:38,241 --> 01:17:39,640
You interested?

1339
01:17:39,709 --> 01:17:42,906
Yeah, l totally am.
You can hook that up?

1340
01:17:42,979 --> 01:17:46,471
Yeah. l can hook that up.

1341
01:17:46,549 --> 01:17:47,607
That's awesome!

1342
01:17:47,684 --> 01:17:49,481
But l won't.

1343
01:17:57,360 --> 01:18:00,193
Yo, l need to go rub one out real
quick. Okay? Will you be alright?

1344
01:18:00,263 --> 01:18:01,958
Yeah. Why are you telling me this?

1345
01:18:02,031 --> 01:18:03,055
See you.

1346
01:18:03,132 --> 01:18:05,828
So, uh, lovely ladies.

1347
01:18:17,647 --> 01:18:19,114
Hey.

1348
01:18:19,182 --> 01:18:21,742
<i>I read your story about the girl.</i>

1349
01:18:21,818 --> 01:18:22,978
You did?

1350
01:18:23,052 --> 01:18:25,282
lt's good, man. You're very talented.

1351
01:18:25,355 --> 01:18:28,153
<i>Believe me, if I thought it
was shit, I would tell you.</i>

1352
01:18:28,224 --> 01:18:32,058
<i>The question is,
do you want to be a writer</i>

1353
01:18:32,128 --> 01:18:34,323
or just someone who writes?

1354
01:18:36,065 --> 01:18:38,863
Because if you want to be a writer
then you have to get out

1355
01:18:38,935 --> 01:18:41,165
<i>and experience things
worth writing about.</i>

1356
01:18:41,237 --> 01:18:44,764
Get the fuck out of here and
entangle yourself in some drama.

1357
01:18:44,841 --> 01:18:48,004
Okay. Well, you know, l think
l've had enough drama--

1358
01:18:48,077 --> 01:18:51,274
What? Come on! No, you haven't!

1359
01:18:51,347 --> 01:18:54,475
lt's time for you to reach
under the bull

1360
01:18:54,551 --> 01:18:57,247
and just grab him by the nuts.

1361
01:18:59,255 --> 01:19:01,621
l mean, metaphorically.
Do you understand?

1362
01:19:03,893 --> 01:19:05,554
Who are you?

1363
01:19:05,628 --> 01:19:07,027
Rwa.

1364
01:19:07,096 --> 01:19:08,290
Rwa.

1365
01:19:08,364 --> 01:19:10,924
<i>Best friend, BFF always, uh--</i>

1366
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:12,024
l knew it.

1367
01:19:12,101 --> 01:19:13,500
<i>That Tyler.</i>

1368
01:19:13,570 --> 01:19:15,561
There you go.
You can go, thank you.

1369
01:19:15,638 --> 01:19:16,798
Uh-- No.

1370
01:19:17,974 --> 01:19:19,965
Oh, fuck.

1371
01:19:20,043 --> 01:19:22,136
<i>Next.</i>

1372
01:19:22,211 --> 01:19:25,203
Oh, my God. ls it really That Tyler?

1373
01:19:25,281 --> 01:19:27,977
Misogynistic pig,
please sign my book.

1374
01:19:28,051 --> 01:19:30,918
<i>I don't know what to say.</i>

1375
01:19:30,987 --> 01:19:33,979
<i>I'm an idiot.</i>

1376
01:19:34,057 --> 01:19:36,685
<i>I have to lie to get laid.</i>

1377
01:19:41,698 --> 01:19:44,064
l don't know what that look means.

1378
01:19:44,133 --> 01:19:47,864
Does that mean that we're all good,

1379
01:19:47,937 --> 01:19:52,271
or is that a look like you're
gonna castrate or something?

1380
01:20:01,117 --> 01:20:04,177
<i>Come on, Lexi, I don't want you
to be upset anymore.</i>

1381
01:20:04,253 --> 01:20:05,777
Upset?

1382
01:20:05,855 --> 01:20:07,914
Tyler, l'm not upset anymore.

1383
01:20:07,991 --> 01:20:11,552
<i>I don't care. I have to care
to be upset.</i>

1384
01:20:11,628 --> 01:20:14,461
<i>You put your big fat stupid
head in the garbage disposal</i>

1385
01:20:14,530 --> 01:20:16,361
and l gladly pulled the switch.

1386
01:20:16,432 --> 01:20:17,456
Seriously.

1387
01:20:19,202 --> 01:20:21,966
<i>Okay, look.
Here, how about this?</i>

1388
01:20:22,038 --> 01:20:24,871
<i>Dear Lexi,</i>

1389
01:20:24,941 --> 01:20:28,206
<i>I'm very, very, very, truly,
truly sorry</i>

1390
01:20:28,277 --> 01:20:31,440
for ever ever taking
for granted what we had.

1391
01:20:35,351 --> 01:20:37,410
Love,

1392
01:20:37,487 --> 01:20:39,250
Tyler.

1393
01:20:39,322 --> 01:20:41,984
<i>Just give me a few minutes
with these people.</i>

1394
01:20:42,058 --> 01:20:44,720
<i>We can talk after, Okay?</i>

1395
01:20:44,794 --> 01:20:46,318
Ugh.

1396
01:20:49,298 --> 01:20:51,493
That was, uh--
That was really nice.

1397
01:20:53,569 --> 01:20:56,163
l'm actually here to 
apologize to you.

1398
01:20:56,239 --> 01:20:59,231
Just like a hemorrhoid,
the sister fucker returns.

1399
01:20:59,308 --> 01:21:00,798
Where's your copy of the book?

1400
01:21:00,877 --> 01:21:03,505
Tyler, l'm really sorry.

1401
01:21:03,579 --> 01:21:06,139
Oh, l'm sorry, too, sir.
You see the rules?

1402
01:21:06,215 --> 01:21:09,082
<i>No book, you can't be there.</i>

1403
01:21:09,152 --> 01:21:10,915
Yeah, but l'm--

1404
01:21:10,987 --> 01:21:13,080
No book.

1405
01:21:13,156 --> 01:21:15,249
Tyler, this is important,
l'm trying to--

1406
01:21:15,324 --> 01:21:16,552
Next!

1407
01:21:16,626 --> 01:21:18,253
Apologize.

1408
01:21:18,327 --> 01:21:21,785
Okay, fine, here. You can take this
book. lt's special for you.

1409
01:21:21,864 --> 01:21:24,594
l don't give two shits about
your fucking book.

1410
01:21:24,667 --> 01:21:27,932
l care about you, you know--
l , l care about us.

1411
01:21:28,004 --> 01:21:29,096
Take the book.

1412
01:21:29,172 --> 01:21:31,538
l care about Trista.

1413
01:21:31,607 --> 01:21:32,767
<i>Take the fucking book.</i>

1414
01:21:32,842 --> 01:21:34,002
No.

1415
01:21:34,077 --> 01:21:35,408
Take the book!

1416
01:21:35,478 --> 01:21:36,911
l'm not taking the book.

1417
01:21:36,979 --> 01:21:38,241
l'm not!

1418
01:21:38,314 --> 01:21:41,215
Take the fucking book!

1419
01:21:41,284 --> 01:21:43,377
Fine! l have the book, now what?

1420
01:21:43,453 --> 01:21:47,412
Oh, you're welcome! You know what?
End of the line for you!

1421
01:21:47,490 --> 01:21:50,152
And no head shot. Go!

1422
01:21:51,794 --> 01:21:53,091
Go.

1423
01:22:23,392 --> 01:22:24,757
Ugh.

1424
01:22:55,758 --> 01:22:57,282
l missed you.

1425
01:22:57,360 --> 01:22:59,089
Hm. l know.

1426
01:22:59,162 --> 01:23:02,393
Why did you tell that Buzz guy
l shaved my ass hole?

1427
01:23:02,465 --> 01:23:04,092
Because you did.

1428
01:23:04,167 --> 01:23:06,135
Yeah, l did it for you.

1429
01:23:07,470 --> 01:23:09,028
Sweet.

1430
01:23:11,307 --> 01:23:14,208
That's-- That's oddly romrntic.

1431
01:23:14,277 --> 01:23:18,111
Alright, l guess l gotta catch a cab.

1432
01:23:18,181 --> 01:23:20,775
Ugh. Where's Heath?

1433
01:23:22,885 --> 01:23:25,285
l think maybe you should wait
for a few minutes.

1434
01:23:25,354 --> 01:23:26,548
Why?

1435
01:23:26,622 --> 01:23:29,989
lt's called courtesy, Kieran.

1436
01:23:40,236 --> 01:23:42,136
Alright.

1437
01:23:42,205 --> 01:23:44,639
Anybody want to say goodbye, or,

1438
01:23:45,741 --> 01:23:48,141
wish me luck? Tyler?

1439
01:23:51,147 --> 01:23:52,944
Good talk!

1440
01:23:53,015 --> 01:23:54,414
Alright, l'll see you, uh--

1441
01:23:56,786 --> 01:23:59,254
<i>This is for my sister.</i>

1442
01:23:59,322 --> 01:24:01,085
<i>She'll understand.</i>

1443
01:24:01,157 --> 01:24:02,454
What's in the box?

1444
01:24:02,525 --> 01:24:04,493
Come on, what's in the box?

1445
01:24:04,560 --> 01:24:06,084
What's in the box?

1446
01:24:06,162 --> 01:24:07,720
What are you doing?

1447
01:24:07,797 --> 01:24:09,731
<i>How's the doctor?</i>

1448
01:24:09,799 --> 01:24:12,290
Was she licking your balls?

1449
01:24:12,368 --> 01:24:15,496
l would never ask her to do
something like that.

1450
01:24:15,571 --> 01:24:17,664
lf she wants to do it,
l'll let her do it, but,

1451
01:24:17,740 --> 01:24:21,039
l can be a dick, like,
''Hey, bitch, lick my balls.''

1452
01:24:21,110 --> 01:24:23,578
<i>I'll just let her do it on her own.</i>

1453
01:24:24,881 --> 01:24:25,939
Classy.

1454
01:24:26,015 --> 01:24:27,482
Yeah.

1455
01:24:27,550 --> 01:24:29,950
<i>Alright so, is this goodbye?</i>

1456
01:24:30,019 --> 01:24:32,044
Are we hugging, or--? No?

1457
01:24:32,121 --> 01:24:34,487
Awkward to stand around
and nod at each other.

1458
01:24:34,557 --> 01:24:35,649
Yeah.

1459
01:24:35,725 --> 01:24:37,352
l hope your plane doesn't crash.

1460
01:24:37,426 --> 01:24:38,620
Thanks, that's nice.

1461
01:24:38,694 --> 01:24:41,322
At least admit one thing. 
You had fun.

1462
01:24:41,397 --> 01:24:43,490
You had some fun in the penthouse.

1463
01:24:43,566 --> 01:24:46,399
lt was definitely an experience,
let's leave it at that.

1464
01:24:46,469 --> 01:24:47,868
You had the best part,

1465
01:24:47,937 --> 01:24:50,462
fucking your sister! Ah!

1466
01:24:50,539 --> 01:24:52,598
<i>Oh, God, I wish I was you.</i>

1467
01:24:52,675 --> 01:24:54,836
<i>She's fucking hot!</i>

1468
01:24:54,911 --> 01:24:57,471
<i>Alright. But you did have fun,
right?</i>

1469
01:24:57,546 --> 01:24:59,275
Fucking your sister? Hell, yeah!

1470
01:25:04,453 --> 01:25:05,943
l'll see you.

1471
01:25:06,022 --> 01:25:07,421
<i>Alright.</i>

1472
01:25:07,490 --> 01:25:08,514
What?

1473
01:25:08,591 --> 01:25:09,615
<i>Out, too.</i>

1474
01:25:09,692 --> 01:25:12,092
l'm staying! Leave me alone!

1475
01:25:12,161 --> 01:25:14,959
l'm not gonna leave! No!

1476
01:25:15,031 --> 01:25:18,364
Alright, you can stay,
but you have to pay rent.

1477
01:25:18,434 --> 01:25:21,096
You got the fucking place for free!
