1
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,675
I can feel him watching me.

2
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:23,871
He's been after me for years.

3
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:29,350
Ever since I was a boy.

4
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:32,193
First he took Mom and Dad.

5
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,476
Then he took Jody.

6
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,317
Now he's after me.

7
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:42,109
Mike, that Tall Man of yours
did not take Jody away.

8
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,792
Jody died in a car wreck.

9
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,589
<i>Reggie told me that it was all a dream</i>.

10
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:03,035
<i>And I was beginning to think</i>
<i>that maybe he was right</i>.

11
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,031
Boy!

12
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,556
<i>Reggie saved me that time</i>.

13
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:30,120
<i>And we've been on the run ever since</i>.

14
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,195
<i>But somehow, he keeps coming back</i>.

15
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:31,390
<i>And just when</i>
<i>we think we've destroyed him</i>...

16
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:35,632
<i>We must remember,</i>
<i>we can never trust the things that we see</i>.

17
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,318
<i>Because nothing is ever as it seems</i>.

18
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,675
Reg!

19
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,516
Reg?

20
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,151
Hey!

21
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:06,312
Oh, shit.

22
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,756
Ohh!

23
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,675
Mike. Come on, Mike, wake up.

24
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,391
Oh, shit.

25
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,193
Mike, come on, we gotta get outta here.

26
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,479
Come on.

27
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,238
God damn it!

28
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:11,635
Come on, buddy. Come on Mike,
put your arms around me.

29
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,676
Come on, buddy.

30
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,756
Come on.

31
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,430
Eight seconds to hell, God damn you!

32
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,239
I don't want him in pieces.

33
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,754
It's the only way you're gonna get him.

34
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,519
Then I'll wait.

35
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:07,030
Take good care of him.

36
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:38,518
Still no change.

37
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,596
Shh.

38
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:49,074
It's all right, it's natural.

39
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,912
Just relax.

40
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:55,190
You see the light now up ahead, don't you?

41
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,430
Go to it.

42
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,751
<i>Go to the warmth of the light</i>.

43
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,629
- Jody?
- Yeah. It's me, little brother.

44
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:19,032
Don't be afraid. I'm here
to take care of you and show you the way.

45
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,439
Mike, I want you to go back.

46
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,715
You're not with these others.

47
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,273
Stay away from the light.

48
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:40,155
Come back, Mike.

49
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,671
Boy!

50
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,476
Hi. Everything OK?

51
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,158
Urgh.

52
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:01,069
Aaah!

53
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,794
Ohhh!

54
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:41,350
Come on, buddy.
We gotta get the hell outta here.

55
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,797
All I know is, once you see
one of those chrome brain drains,

56
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,952
the Tall Man is not far behind.

57
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,000
<i>Mike</i>...

58
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,396
Stop the car!

59
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,309
It was Jody, I saw him.

60
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:19,912
Your brother's been dead
for ten years, Mike.

61
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,437
Come on, Mike, we don't have time for this.
Come on, let's go.

62
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,556
We gotta get outta here.

63
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,070
God damn it!

64
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,389
Be careful, they could be anywhere.

65
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,313
Come on, there's more gear in the house.
I'll go first.

66
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,356
Jody!

67
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:13,234
Jody, what the hell are you doing here?
You're dead!

68
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,197
So, what else is new?

69
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,040
- No, you can't touch me.
- Why not?

70
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,237
I haven't got the juice to stay long
and you've gotta get out.

71
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,912
What are you talking about? Why?

72
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,070
I don't want you to wind up like me.

73
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,870
What the hell...?

74
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:42,111
I'm sorry, Mike.
I knew he might lock onto me.

75
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:50,431
Shit. It's one of those things.

76
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:01,235
- <i>It's me, Mike</i>.
- Jody, what the hell happened to you?

77
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,993
- <i>I'm in here, Mike</i>.
- Get back, I can get a shot.

78
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:08,551
- In where?
- Mike, who the hell are you talking to?

79
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:12,428
Can't you hear? It's Jody, he's in the ball.
He's talking to me.

80
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,636
Yeah, right, Mike.

81
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:19,076
<i>Little brother,</i>
<i>he's coming for you right now</i>.

82
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:22,789
<i>I can't stop him,</i>
<i>but maybe I can slow him down</i>.

83
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,795
<i>Mike, stay behind me</i>.

84
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,994
It's time now, boy.

85
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,919
Aaah!

86
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,956
Why?

87
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,952
Why do you want me? Why?

88
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,076
Well, Jody, I guess
even you couldn't stop him.

89
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,712
<i>Holtsville</i>.

90
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,916
Holtsville?

91
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,956
What did you say?

92
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:15,191
Jody, did you say something?

93
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,198
Hell, now I'm talking to this damned thing.

94
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,756
Sure fucked up my hallway.

95
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:17,078
What's up Highway 32 here? Holtsville?

96
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:20,596
- You don't wanna be going up there.
- Why not?

97
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,750
Toxic spill, a couple of years back.

98
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,755
That'll be 22 bucks.

99
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:29,354
Oh, yeah.

100
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,396
There you go. Thanks a lot.

101
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,198
Yeah.

102
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:17,513
What are you doing here?

103
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,230
Are you talking to me?

104
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:25,274
Well, I don't see anybody else around here.

105
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:29,876
Well, I'm just helping myself. These folks
left all their stuff. Can you believe that?

106
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,831
Lord above!

107
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,836
Why, look what I just found.

108
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:40,559
- Do you think it's loaded?
- Hey!

109
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,355
Ooh, that was fun.

110
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,396
Let me have it.

111
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:52,358
Give me the gun.
Give me the goddamn gun.

112
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,716
Thank you.

113
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,711
Ow.

114
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:09,270
- What are we gonna do with him?
- Take him outta town.

115
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,511
Yeah, good. Then what?

116
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:16,359
Gut him and put him in the ground.

117
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,511
Got any gold teeth there, fella?

118
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:25,990
Let's stick him
in the back of that muscle car.

119
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,996
I'm driving.

120
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,552
Phew-ee!
Boy, oh, boy.

121
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,596
Today is my lucky day.

122
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:23,148
Mmm.

123
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,668
I bet there's lots of good stuff in there.

124
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:30,958
You two go ahead to the front
and I'll take the back.

125
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:04,073
Just a couple of old folks, that's all.

126
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,757
Must be deaf.

127
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,160
<i>You're in trouble! You're in trouble!</i>

128
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,916
Rufus...

129
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,076
Christ, it's just a kid.

130
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:14,316
- Well, he ain't never gonna grow up.
- I got me a little rug rat.

131
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:18,279
- The boy's a little fighter. I like that.
- Don't hurt him yet, Henry.

132
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,920
Let's have a little fun with him first.

133
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,238
Stop, boy!

134
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:41,594
No!

135
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:45,479
Rufus, we gotta kiss it. Come on.

136
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,078
Stop!

137
00:22:56,160 --> 00:23:00,836
- Or I'll throw this.
- You think we're playing games, kid?

138
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,672
This is for real.

139
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:05,274
So is this.

140
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:39,513
God damn it, now you've done it,
you little bastard.

141
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,398
- Hold still, you little fuck.
- OK.

142
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,073
Just you wait till I get up outta here,
you son of a bitch.

143
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,591
What's going on out there?

144
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:14,355
Hey! What's going on out there?

145
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,356
Hey, hey, what's going on?

146
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,396
Somebody let me outta here!

147
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,358
- Who are you?
- I own this car.

148
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,715
Come on, let me outta here.

149
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:28,234
How do I know you're not one of them?

150
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:31,278
Cos I'm in here, God damn it.

151
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,956
Thanks. I owe you one.

152
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,556
These others your family?

153
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:21,592
No. The Tall Man got my family.

154
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:25,116
These are just scavengers
that tried to hurt me.

155
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,551
Sundown. We'd better get inside.

156
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:37,030
What's the rush?
You said the Tall Man had moved on.

157
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:41,914
Yeah. But he left these... things.

158
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,950
I call them Lurkers.
They only come out at night.

159
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,632
Come on.

160
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,558
I've been on my own
since my parents died.

161
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,596
Yeah, it must've been rough.

162
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,437
Yeah.

163
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,796
My father was the sheriff.

164
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,789
<i>He was one of the first ones taken</i>.

165
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:31,588
<i>He'd gone to meet the new owners</i>
<i>of the cemetery</i>.

166
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:35,036
<i>They found him the next morning in a ditch</i>.

167
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,190
<i>Said it was a heart attack</i>.

168
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:46,999
<i>Then they didn't cover him up right away</i>.
<i>So I waited</i>.

169
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:49,036
<i>And I waited</i>.

170
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:56,032
They forgot to cover him up.

171
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,758
It's just a mistake, honey.

172
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:01,071
I'm sure they'll do it tomorrow. Come on.

173
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:05,954
<i>My mom was too upset</i>
<i>to understand what was really going on</i>.

174
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,070
<i>I knew someone had murdered my father</i>.

175
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:13,271
<i>Then we came face to face with the truth</i>.

176
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:33,840
Stay here, Timmy. Don't move.

177
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,433
<i>The town went quietly after that</i>.

178
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,391
<i>And I've been here ever since</i>.

179
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:45,232
Alone?

180
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,759
Yeah.

181
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,792
Wow.

182
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:26,389
I couldn't reach the pedals that first year
but now I can.

183
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,710
- I've been practising.
- Practising what?

184
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:33,828
Driving. I'm getting pretty good.
Maybe I could take your Hemi for a spin.

185
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:37,595
No way.
I've been restoring that car for two years.

186
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,716
God damn it.

187
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,356
Where the hell is that pink hearse?

188
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:51,035
Er, Reg?

189
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,071
There's something else missing.

190
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:58,116
The Lurkers got 'em.

191
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,116
Shit!

192
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:08,918
OK, I'm gonna be moving on now.
I can drop you at the next town.

193
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,675
Well, I was thinking
maybe I could tag along for a while.

194
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:14,955
Tim, you don't wanna go where I'm going.

195
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:17,918
Hell, I don't wanna go there either.

196
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:20,910
Two's better than one.

197
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,956
I can help.

198
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:32,715
- See?
- A little kid shouldn't be playing with guns.

199
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,716
I ain't a kid no more, Reg.

200
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,516
Hey, what's this?

201
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:00,279
Uh, it's one of those balls
I was telling you about.

202
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:03,670
It came over to our side
and got cooked in the process somehow.

203
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,836
I gotta get some directions here.

204
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:44,957
Why don't you get out
and stretch your legs?

205
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,996
OK.

206
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:57,915
- Hi.
- Hi.

207
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,833
- All these kids yours?
- Oh, no.

208
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:04,549
They're some of the orphans
that straggled down here from Holtsville.

209
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,995
We're just trying to take care of them.

210
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:59,598
Aaah!

211
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:35,632
Looks like
we caught ourselves a fish, girlfriend.

212
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,476
What's his problem?

213
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:49,632
We're in deep shit.
We gotta get outta here before...

214
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:52,796
Oh, fuck.

215
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,711
What the hell...?

216
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:09,793
Anita!

217
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:31,519
Oh!

218
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,637
Unlock these goddamn handcuffs.

219
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,757
Don't go near that thing!

220
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,638
What the fuck was that?

221
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:59,076
That's kinda hard to explain.

222
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,832
And who the hell are you two?

223
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:03,559
I'm Reggie and this...

224
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:05,517
This is Tim.

225
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,111
They call me Rocky.

226
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:13,072
What the hell are you doing here?
Is this your home town?

227
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:15,799
It was. My whole family just vanished.

228
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,711
And the rest of the town 86'd.

229
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,916
This town's dead.

230
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,312
Nothing left here
but those damned sentinels.

231
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:27,631
We're not hanging out here
till another one turns up.

232
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:30,075
Come on, let's go.

233
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:35,109
You go on. But I ain't letting no Christmas
tree ornament back me up outta here

234
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,589
before I do what I got to do.

235
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:40,638
Suit yourself. Lots of luck, baby.

236
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,950
Thanks, kid. I owe you one.

237
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,230
Two.

238
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,959
- What?
- On my count, you owe me two.

239
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:04,068
OK. OK, I owe you two.

240
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:07,516
Hey, you gonna dump me off
at that lady's place again?

241
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,037
Come on.

242
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:20,911
We've got things to do.

243
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:26,476
Watch the upholstery.

244
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,236
Yah!

245
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:42,036
Yah! Yah!

246
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,553
Yee-ha!

247
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,599
Yee-ha!

248
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:08,949
Hell, I don't have a clue which way to go.

249
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,270
Er, Reg?

250
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:14,317
Watch what it does.

251
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,316
Which way should we go?

252
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:30,074
Well, OK. I hope that ball's got
a better sense of direction than mine do.

253
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:58,912
What's up?

254
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:03,232
Well, I guess you could say
we're on a search-and-destroy mission.

255
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:05,959
- You two?
- Yeah?

256
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:10,158
We're searching for a friend, but first
we gotta destroy the bastard who's got him.

257
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:14,233
Oh, by the way, he's the guy
who wiped out your home town.

258
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,157
Wanna come along?

259
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:29,671
Picture that. The three of us
facing down the forces of evil.

260
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:32,752
Yeah. Have you got something better to do?

261
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,756
Move over.

262
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,759
So, who's this guy we're chasing?

263
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:53,196
He's a very tall man from...
God knows where.

264
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:56,750
Maybe from another planet.
From another planet?

265
00:41:56,840 --> 00:42:00,355
He kills people,
he ships their bodies back to... wherever.

266
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:03,318
You're pulling my leg.
I wish I was.

267
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:06,597
That explains
why everyone's checked out.

268
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:08,796
I've been through four towns, all deserted.

269
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:12,589
Half this county's been wiped out
and nobody's figured it out yet.

270
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:15,513
So, where are we headed?
East.

271
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:18,114
From what I can tell,
that's where he's headed.

272
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:24,878
You're pretty good
with those things, aren't you?

273
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:27,520
The army taught me to defend myself.

274
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:30,558
These just keep people
from getting too close.

275
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:34,036
What's next on the map?

276
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:36,076
Just another small town.

277
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:40,792
"Boulton, home of the spring apple festival

278
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:47,109
"and the largest Gothic mausoleum
in the western US."

279
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:49,316
That might be worth visiting.

280
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:31,036
I need a room.

281
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:33,315
We got twin beds or single queens.

282
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:39,039
Er, give me that queen.

283
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:43,239
You pay 20 for that. In advance.

284
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:50,197
How far is it up to that next town?
What is it...?

285
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:53,037
Boulton?

286
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:57,993
What do you wanna go there for?
It's a ghost town, everybody moved out.

287
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:00,435
I'm looking for a friend.

288
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:04,195
Anthrax plague a couple of years back,
wiped out the sheep farms.

289
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:06,236
Gee, it was bad up there.

290
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:11,075
It got some of the families too.

291
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:13,628
I'd stay the hell outta there, if I were you.

292
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:17,838
Yeah, I get the picture. Thanks.

293
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,672
Damn our luck.

294
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:31,230
All they had was a single room
with a queen-size bed.

295
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:34,748
Would you mind sleeping in the car, Tim?

296
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:38,469
Do you want the front or the back seat?

297
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:40,516
Er...

298
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:43,273
You can have the whole car to yourself.

299
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:52,155
You know, it's gonna get cold out here.
Why don't you come inside with us?

300
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:57,431
- Well...
- We can make room.

301
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:04,479
Well, it's better in here
than on the floor in there.

302
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,594
See the floor? You're bunking there tonight.

303
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:27,831
Come on,
the bed's big enough for both of us.

304
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:29,876
- Ah, come on!
- All right.

305
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:37,317
But, Reg, don't fuck with me.

306
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:55,958
Hey, you know, I was just thinking.

307
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:59,032
- Maybe we could...
- Get some sleep?

308
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:08,594
Oh, come on, Rocky, loosen up a little.

309
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:11,392
Ever try vanilla?

310
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:15,473
Didn't I tell you?
Dairy products give me gas!

311
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,195
Come on, Rocky.

312
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:23,316
- Come on.
- All right!

313
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:28,233
But we do this... my way.

314
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:31,236
Whatever you say.

315
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:34,236
Dominate me, baby.

316
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:46,472
Oh, baby, I'm ready.

317
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:51,596
Sweet dreams.

318
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:02,638
Shit.

319
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:09,476
He said Boulton was right up the road.

320
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:12,233
I told you
you shouldn't have taken that right turn.

321
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:14,276
Are we lost?

322
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:38,559
Something tells me we're on the right track.

323
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:00,675
Damn. Where did they go?

324
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:05,837
From the look of this place,
they're around here somewhere.

325
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:15,436
There!

326
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:19,950
There must be a dozen.
Why did they leave them there?

327
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:22,554
I don't know.

328
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:25,074
But we gotta be careful.

329
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:29,796
No!

330
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:43,752
- Tim, are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm OK.

331
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:47,276
Goddamn grave diggers.

332
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,230
Somebody should stand watch.

333
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:57,075
Don't worry, I circled back around.
I'm sure we gave 'em the slip.

334
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:00,716
Gonna be a cold night.

335
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:07,709
Yeah. They say the best way to keep warm
is to pack two bodies to a bag.

336
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:11,716
Dream on, Reg.

337
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:00,436
Oh, baby, I like that.

338
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:19,355
I like it like that. Oh.

339
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:22,995
Oh, yeah.

340
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:26,470
Oh, right there. Right there.

341
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:28,516
Take me, take me!

342
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:36,752
Hey, Jody. How's it going?

343
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:39,957
Reg, I need to talk to you
about a couple of things.

344
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:42,873
I'm kinda busy right now, Jody.

345
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:46,191
Oh, yeah. Oh, don't stop.

346
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:48,111
I don't wanna let the lady down.

347
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:51,272
Yeah, Reg,
I kinda need you to get behind me.

348
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:55,114
I mean,
I need you to get behind what I'm saying.

349
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:56,633
Like, right now.

350
00:50:56,720 --> 00:51:01,111
Oh, Reggie, oh, you're the best.

351
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:04,112
Oh, you're so big.

352
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:07,116
Oh, yes. Ooh.

353
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:18,516
Jody?

354
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:23,950
Don't move.

355
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:45,359
- What's going on, Jody?
- Reg, we gotta get Mike now.

356
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:49,228
- How the hell are we gonna do that?
- Over here. I'm gonna take you to him.

357
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:54,558
Hey, hey, wait.

358
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:56,551
Where the hell are we?

359
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:58,551
I don't know, man.

360
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:00,358
Somewhere in your mind.

361
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:05,518
A dry lake bed...

362
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:10,396
I was here as a boy.

363
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:25,228
Tell me something -
how does he get you in that ball?

364
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:28,039
<i>I'll explain everything</i>.
<i>But we've gotta go now</i>.

365
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:30,076
Wow.

366
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:41,556
<i>Just step on through</i>.

367
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:44,518
Oh, Jody, I'm afraid of these things.

368
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:46,955
<i>Think of it as a doorway</i>.

369
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:55,556
We gotta make this quick.

370
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:37,437
Let me outta here!

371
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:42,594
- You know the way out.
- I don't know what you mean.

372
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:47,599
Use your brain, boy.

373
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:44,909
Come on, brother, we gotta get outta here.

374
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:55,716
Come on, let's go.

375
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:08,960
Wake up, wake up.

376
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:28,958
Whoa, Mike!

377
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:38,275
- Hey, shut that thing down before...
- He's locked onto me.

378
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:40,316
He's controlling me through the gate.

379
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:47,395
Do it, Reg, you've done it before.

380
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,753
Get outta here. He's coming through now.

381
00:55:56,680 --> 00:55:58,830
What the hell's that?

382
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:09,030
I'm too old for this shit.

383
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:11,472
- Reggie.
- Thanks.

384
00:56:11,560 --> 00:56:14,757
- Are you all right?
- I think so.

385
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:17,438
Where did his hands go?

386
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:45,952
- What is it?
- I think it's one of his hands.

387
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:50,716
Be careful.

388
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:57,672
Reggie!

389
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:21,831
Over there.

390
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:37,155
Shit, there's the other one.

391
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:39,519
Reggie, watch out!

392
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:49,635
No, no, no, I can handle this.

393
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:51,278
I can handle...

394
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:53,351
Oh, shit!

395
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:08,951
Damn, that was close.

396
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,956
Close to what?

397
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,355
It's no use, Reg.

398
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:24,908
One way or another, he's gonna get me.

399
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:28,230
You're better off leaving me behind.

400
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:30,629
We're not leaving anybody behind.

401
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:35,111
There's somebody back there.

402
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:47,271
- Oh, shit.
- Friends of yours?

403
00:58:55,480 --> 00:58:56,549
God damn it.

404
00:58:57,760 --> 00:58:59,637
Load this up.

405
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:02,393
Let's get those dead assholes
back in the ground where they belong.

406
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:06,434
Hold on.

407
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,752
Shoot her! Shoot that bitch!

408
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:16,195
Damn, who were those guys?

409
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:19,033
Well, I can tell you this,
they work for the Tall Man.

410
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:22,795
- That means he's on our tail.
- It looks like we're on foot.

411
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:24,472
Both front tyres are blown.

412
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:26,118
Where are we gonna go?

413
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:28,156
Into town.

414
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:33,314
I say we find that big mortuary
you told me about and hole up there.

415
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:37,837
- Why the hell would we do that?
- It's the last place he'd look.

416
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:45,871
I don't know about this, Mike.

417
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:48,793
Our butts could be
hanging out in the wind here.

418
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:51,952
Man, I sure hope
you know what you're doing.

419
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:13,028
- This'll do.
- It's perfect.

420
01:02:23,560 --> 01:02:26,233
- The mausoleum's empty.
- Nothing in the basement.

421
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:28,834
- It's clean.
- Hey, look at this.

422
01:02:56,400 --> 01:03:00,109
- Cold.
- What was that, Mike?

423
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:02,998
Just a memory about the Tall Man.

424
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:07,676
- Yeah?
- Cold. He doesn't like it when it gets cold.

425
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:12,158
Why the hell didn't you ever tell me that?

426
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:14,470
- We could've done something.
- Shit.

427
01:03:16,120 --> 01:03:18,315
What the hell are those?

428
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:20,072
Cryogenics.

429
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:22,549
All the mortuaries are into it now.

430
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:27,031
These guys figure they'll wake up in
a couple of hundred years with new bodies.

431
01:03:27,120 --> 01:03:29,554
Some folks never know when to give it up.

432
01:03:31,560 --> 01:03:34,597
Now, look who's talking.

433
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:38,471
We gotta get somebody up on the roof.

434
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:41,233
Right, I'll take the first shift.

435
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:43,959
You guys better barricade these doors.

436
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:23,149
<i>Jody, teach me about him</i>.

437
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:26,516
<i>I need to know why</i>.

438
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:02,318
<i>What's he doing?</i>

439
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:05,756
<i> He's massing an army</i>

440
01:05:05,840 --> 01:05:09,753
<i>to conquer dimensions, worids unknown</i>.

441
01:05:11,840 --> 01:05:15,628
<i>The dwarf creatures</i>
<i>are the by-product of the process,</i>

442
01:05:15,720 --> 01:05:19,508
<i>left with only a vestigial part</i>
<i>of the cerebral cortex</i>.

443
01:05:20,520 --> 01:05:23,512
<i>They act on instinct and impulse</i>.

444
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,594
<i>He compacts the corpse,</i>

445
01:05:30,680 --> 01:05:32,591
<i>amputates the mind</i>

446
01:05:32,680 --> 01:05:34,671
<i>and encases it</i>.

447
01:05:48,080 --> 01:05:53,154
<i>He then turns their bodies into drones</i>
<i>and their minds into killers</i>.

448
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:25,430
- He's still laying in there.
- Let's save some for the boys.

449
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:27,795
There's a refrigerator next door.

450
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:35,679
Oh.

451
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:39,755
Rocky.

452
01:07:42,200 --> 01:07:44,555
I thought you were asleep.

453
01:07:50,120 --> 01:07:51,712
Oh, baby.

454
01:07:51,800 --> 01:07:53,756
You are hot tonight.

455
01:08:00,200 --> 01:08:02,156
Smells like something's burning.

456
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:03,992
It's just me, baby.

457
01:08:10,040 --> 01:08:14,352
Just wanted a taste before I eat.

458
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:49,756
Whoa!

459
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:01,995
Aah!

460
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:22,270
<i> Mike, leave. Now</i>.

461
01:10:18,680 --> 01:10:21,194
Down.

462
01:10:23,240 --> 01:10:25,196
Much better.

463
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:30,830
Welcome home, boy.

464
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:35,197
You've found your way back
to where you started.

465
01:10:36,040 --> 01:10:39,396
Your journey is now complete.

466
01:10:47,080 --> 01:10:48,593
Damn, you ugly...

467
01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:13,798
Let me go! Let me go!

468
01:11:14,920 --> 01:11:16,876
Let me go!

469
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:31,795
You have lived in this flesh constraint
long enough.

470
01:11:31,880 --> 01:11:35,156
Now it is time for you to come back.

471
01:11:36,480 --> 01:11:37,913
To me.

472
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:42,039
Don't buy it, Mike. He's a liar and a killer.

473
01:11:42,120 --> 01:11:44,953
Tim, listen to me,
there are thousands of them!

474
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:47,031
Tell Reggie...

475
01:11:52,440 --> 01:11:54,795
I have plans for you.

476
01:11:56,160 --> 01:11:58,071
Later.

477
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:21,069
Yo, bitch! Hands off my boy.

478
01:12:25,160 --> 01:12:27,879
He's mine.

479
01:13:14,040 --> 01:13:16,793
They got the kid. Come on, let's go.

480
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:56,630
Aah!

481
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:01,191
Let go of me!

482
01:14:07,080 --> 01:14:12,757
Let me release you from this imperfect
flesh that ties you to time and space.

483
01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:18,356
All that is unknown
be known to you once more.

484
01:14:28,840 --> 01:14:31,115
Let go of me.

485
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:36,914
Hey, catch this.

486
01:14:39,440 --> 01:14:40,589
Huh?

487
01:15:03,400 --> 01:15:08,713
If you can keep your head
when all about you are losing theirs...

488
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:15,592
Come on.

489
01:15:21,320 --> 01:15:23,595
Hey, wait a minute. Where's Mike?

490
01:15:23,680 --> 01:15:26,513
Your tall friend's here.

491
01:15:26,600 --> 01:15:29,114
He's got him in the embalming room.

492
01:15:29,960 --> 01:15:32,030
Let's go.

493
01:15:51,200 --> 01:15:53,430
Hey, let go of him!

494
01:16:26,280 --> 01:16:28,236
Yeah.

495
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:30,515
Where's Mike?

496
01:16:40,160 --> 01:16:41,718
Check it out, guys!

497
01:17:00,760 --> 01:17:02,955
Get down!

498
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:12,757
Yah!

499
01:17:29,560 --> 01:17:31,516
Come on.

500
01:18:11,840 --> 01:18:13,876
Oh, shit!

501
01:18:22,280 --> 01:18:24,635
Right. Yeah.

502
01:18:53,720 --> 01:18:56,154
Reggie!

503
01:19:23,480 --> 01:19:24,629
Ugh.

504
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:49,432
It's cold.

505
01:19:52,680 --> 01:19:54,511
Mike, wait up.

506
01:19:55,720 --> 01:19:57,676
Mike!

507
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:09,315
Mike, wait.

508
01:20:12,240 --> 01:20:14,117
Stay away from me.

509
01:20:19,880 --> 01:20:21,836
Mike.

510
01:20:23,960 --> 01:20:26,394
Jody. Jody, hey, wait.

511
01:20:26,480 --> 01:20:28,311
What the hell's happening here?

512
01:20:28,400 --> 01:20:31,597
Reg, don't believe everything you see.

513
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:35,635
What the hell's that supposed to mean?

514
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:42,239
Seeing is easy. Understanding?
Well, it takes a little more time.

515
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:48,151
Be patient, Reg. We'll be in touch.

516
01:21:01,720 --> 01:21:04,188
Relax, it's just me.

517
01:21:07,880 --> 01:21:11,190
- Sorry about your friends.
- Yeah.

518
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:17,236
It's not over yet. I say we go back inside
and search this place and find out...

519
01:21:17,320 --> 01:21:19,675
Look, I've had enough.

520
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:24,993
It was nice knowing you boys,
but this kickin' zombie ass just ain't my gig.

521
01:21:25,080 --> 01:21:27,071
I'm outta here, now.

522
01:21:30,160 --> 01:21:33,072
Rocks, I'm gonna miss you.

523
01:21:40,360 --> 01:21:42,316
Enough of that.

524
01:21:45,880 --> 01:21:48,917
Hey, you know,
we made a pretty good team.

525
01:21:51,040 --> 01:21:52,996
Yeah, I know.

526
01:21:53,080 --> 01:21:57,119
Well, keep the balls in the air, Reg.

527
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:14,637
So, what do we do now, Reg?

528
01:22:16,200 --> 01:22:19,510
We gotta find out what happened to Mike.

529
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:21,955
There's gotta be a clue inside.

530
01:22:22,040 --> 01:22:23,996
Come on, let's take a look around.

531
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:29,475
Oh, yeah. Mike told me
to tell you something.

532
01:22:29,560 --> 01:22:32,711
Mike told you
to tell me something about what?

533
01:22:33,560 --> 01:22:35,516
Er...

534
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:39,309
- That there were thousands of them.
- There it is. Thousands.

535
01:22:39,400 --> 01:22:41,436
Thousands of what?

536
01:22:43,120 --> 01:22:45,236
Beats me.

537
01:23:06,360 --> 01:23:07,315
Reggie?

538
01:23:09,240 --> 01:23:10,832
Reggie!

539
01:23:20,120 --> 01:23:22,270
Reggie?

540
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,275
Get outta here.

541
01:23:39,920 --> 01:23:44,471
God damn it! It's all over.

542
01:23:50,360 --> 01:23:53,750
It's never over.
