1
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:20,248
Do I have an original thought
in my head? My bald head?

2
00:00:20,248 --> 00:00:22,709
Do I have an original thought
in my head? My bald head?

3
00:00:22,876 --> 00:00:25,712
Maybe if I were happier,
my hair wouldn't be falling out.

4
00:00:25,879 --> 00:00:29,299
Life is short. I need
to make the most of it.

5
00:00:29,466 --> 00:00:32,969
Today is the first day
of the rest of my life.

6
00:00:34,054 --> 00:00:35,555
I'm a walking cliché.

7
00:00:35,722 --> 00:00:38,308
I really need to go to the doctor
and have my leg checked.

8
00:00:38,475 --> 00:00:40,101
There's something wrong.
A bump.

9
00:00:40,268 --> 00:00:42,562
The dentist called again.
I'm way overdue.

10
00:00:42,729 --> 00:00:44,981
If I stopped putting things off,
I'd be happier.

11
00:00:46,733 --> 00:00:49,778
All I do is sit on my fat ass.
If my ass wasn't fat, I'd be happier.

12
00:00:49,944 --> 00:00:53,198
I wouldn't have to wear these shirts
with the tails out all the time.

13
00:00:53,365 --> 00:00:54,908
Like that's fooling anyone.

14
00:00:55,075 --> 00:00:58,828
Fat ass. I should start jogging again.
Five miles a day.

15
00:00:58,995 --> 00:01:02,040
Really do it this time.
Maybe rock climbing.

16
00:01:02,248 --> 00:01:03,917
I need to turn my life around.

17
00:01:04,084 --> 00:01:06,670
What do I need to do?
I need to fall in love.

18
00:01:06,836 --> 00:01:08,296
I need to have a girlfriend.

19
00:01:08,463 --> 00:01:10,757
I need to read more,
improve myself.

20
00:01:10,924 --> 00:01:12,676
What if I learned Russian
or something?

21
00:01:12,842 --> 00:01:15,887
Or took up an instrument?
I could speak Chinese.

22
00:01:16,054 --> 00:01:19,432
I would be the screenwriter who
speaks Chinese. And plays the oboe.

23
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:22,310
That would be cool.
I should get my hair cut short.

24
00:01:22,477 --> 00:01:25,563
Stop trying to fool everyone
into thinking I have a full head of hair.

25
00:01:25,772 --> 00:01:28,775
How pathetic is that?
Just be real. Confident.

26
00:01:28,942 --> 00:01:31,152
Isn't that what women
are attracted to?

27
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:32,904
Men don't have to be attractive.

28
00:01:33,071 --> 00:01:35,490
But that's not true,
especially these days.

29
00:01:35,657 --> 00:01:38,743
Almost as much pressure on men
as there is on women these days.

30
00:01:38,952 --> 00:01:41,955
Why should I be made to feel I have
to apologize for my existence?

31
00:01:42,122 --> 00:01:43,790
Maybe it's my brain chemistry.

32
00:01:43,957 --> 00:01:46,209
Maybe that's what's wrong with me:
Bad chemistry.

33
00:01:46,376 --> 00:01:49,421
All my problems and anxiety can be
reduced to a chemical imbalance...

34
00:01:49,629 --> 00:01:51,589
...or some kind of
misfiring synapses.

35
00:01:51,756 --> 00:01:53,508
I need to get help for that.

36
00:01:53,675 --> 00:01:55,802
But I'll still be ugly, though.

37
00:01:55,969 --> 00:01:57,637
Nothing's gonna change that.

38
00:01:57,804 --> 00:01:57,971
Shut up!

39
00:01:57,971 --> 00:01:58,805
Shut up!

40
00:02:01,516 --> 00:02:05,020
Let's really try today
to solve our camera problems.

41
00:02:06,438 --> 00:02:08,606
Keep between-take time
at an absolute minimum.

42
00:02:08,815 --> 00:02:10,984
These masks are really hot. Okay?

43
00:02:11,151 --> 00:02:13,820
I wanna be very well-heard
on that from everybody.

44
00:02:13,987 --> 00:02:18,825
Don't futz unless it's absolutely
important to the shot, okay?

45
00:02:18,992 --> 00:02:22,203
I don't say that for me.
I say that for the people sitting here...

46
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:23,997
- Thank you, John.
...in the rubber.

47
00:02:24,164 --> 00:02:26,750
- I like my dress. Okay?
- Very good.

48
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:30,337
So now, folks, you better
heed that advice.

49
00:02:32,505 --> 00:02:33,757
Stand by for picture.

50
00:02:35,258 --> 00:02:38,136
Have her rotate around the table
a little bit further.

51
00:02:41,181 --> 00:02:42,432
Hold on until we're clear.

52
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:45,560
You. You're in the eye line.
Can you please get off the stage?

53
00:02:45,727 --> 00:02:48,021
Yeah, just bring in the six-footer.

54
00:02:53,026 --> 00:02:55,987
What am I doing here?
Why did I bother to come here today?

55
00:02:56,321 --> 00:02:58,114
Nobody even seems to know
my name.

56
00:02:58,281 --> 00:03:03,286
I've been on this planet for 40 years,
and I don't understand a single thing.

57
00:03:03,453 --> 00:03:06,414
Why am I here?
How did I get here?

58
00:04:03,096 --> 00:04:05,682
My leg hurts. I wonder if it's cancer.

59
00:04:05,849 --> 00:04:08,393
There's a bump. I'm starting to sweat.
Stop sweating.

60
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,603
I've got to stop sweating.

61
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:13,565
Can she see it dripping
down my forehead?

62
00:04:13,732 --> 00:04:16,359
She looked at my hairline.
She thinks I'm bald. She...

63
00:04:16,526 --> 00:04:19,070
We think you're great.

64
00:04:19,237 --> 00:04:20,947
Thanks. That's nice to hear.

65
00:04:21,114 --> 00:04:23,908
We all just loved the Malkovich script.

66
00:04:24,075 --> 00:04:26,411
- Thanks. Thanks...
- Such a unique voice.

67
00:04:26,578 --> 00:04:29,205
Boy, I'd love to find
a portal into your brain.

68
00:04:29,372 --> 00:04:31,166
Trust me, it's no fun.

69
00:04:33,418 --> 00:04:36,379
So tell me your thoughts
on this crazy little project of ours.

70
00:04:38,506 --> 00:04:40,175
First, I think it's a great book.

71
00:04:41,634 --> 00:04:43,845
- Laroche is a fun character, isn't he?
- Absolutely.

72
00:04:44,012 --> 00:04:47,265
And Orlean makes orchids
so fascinating.

73
00:04:47,432 --> 00:04:50,977
Plus, her musings on Florida
and orchid poaching...

74
00:04:51,144 --> 00:04:54,397
...Indians. It's just... It's great,
sprawling New Yorker stuff.

75
00:04:54,564 --> 00:04:56,191
I'd want to remain true to that.

76
00:04:56,358 --> 00:05:00,320
I'd wanna let the movie exist,
rather than be...

77
00:05:00,487 --> 00:05:03,865
...artificially plot-driven.
- Great.

78
00:05:04,824 --> 00:05:06,951
I guess I'm not exactly sure
what that means.

79
00:05:09,829 --> 00:05:12,582
I'm not sure I know
what that means either.

80
00:05:12,749 --> 00:05:15,794
I just don't wanna ruin it by making
it a Hollywood thing. You know?

81
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:20,632
Like... an orchid heist movie
or something, you know?

82
00:05:20,799 --> 00:05:23,343
Or changing the orchids
into poppies...

83
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:25,512
...and making it about drug running,
you know?

84
00:05:25,679 --> 00:05:27,555
- Definitely.
- Why can't there be a movie...

85
00:05:27,722 --> 00:05:29,683
...simply about flowers?

86
00:05:30,183 --> 00:05:32,102
I guess we thought that maybe...

87
00:05:32,268 --> 00:05:35,647
...Susan Orlean and Laroche
could fall in love, and...

88
00:05:35,814 --> 00:05:39,567
Okay. But I'm saying, it's like,
I don't wanna cram in sex...

89
00:05:39,734 --> 00:05:42,779
...or guns or car chases...

90
00:05:42,946 --> 00:05:46,616
...you know,
or characters, you know...

91
00:05:46,783 --> 00:05:49,327
...learning profound life lessons.

92
00:05:49,494 --> 00:05:51,496
Or growing,
or coming to like each other...

93
00:05:51,663 --> 00:05:54,916
...or overcoming obstacles to succeed
in the end, you know? I mean...

94
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:57,627
The book isn't like that...

95
00:05:57,794 --> 00:06:01,631
...and life isn't like that.
You know, it just isn't. And...

96
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:07,012
I feel very strongly about this.

97
00:06:09,347 --> 00:06:12,225
John Laroche is a tall guy,
skinny as a stick...

98
00:06:12,392 --> 00:06:15,228
...pale-eyed,
slouch-shouldered...

99
00:06:15,395 --> 00:06:20,025
...sharply handsome, despite the fact
he's missing all his front teeth.

100
00:06:20,191 --> 00:06:23,778
I went to Florida two years ago
to write a piece for The New Yorker.

101
00:06:23,945 --> 00:06:28,033
It was after reading a small article about
a white man and three Seminole men...

102
00:06:28,241 --> 00:06:30,910
...arrested with rare orchids
they'd stolen out of a place...

103
00:06:31,077 --> 00:06:34,414
...called the Fakahatchee Strand
State Preserve.

104
00:06:37,542 --> 00:06:42,130
As natural selection works solely by
and for the good of each being...

105
00:06:43,923 --> 00:06:48,595
...all corporeal and mental endowments
will tend to progress towards perfection.

106
00:06:48,762 --> 00:06:52,766
It's interesting to contemplate
an entangled bank...

107
00:07:10,784 --> 00:07:12,952
Polyrrhiza lindenii.

108
00:07:14,371 --> 00:07:15,997
A ghost.

109
00:07:19,167 --> 00:07:21,419
Cut her down, Russell.

110
00:08:04,421 --> 00:08:06,506
- Morning.
- Hey.

111
00:08:06,673 --> 00:08:09,509
May I ask you gentlemen what you
have in those pillowcases?

112
00:08:09,843 --> 00:08:12,345
Yes, sir, you absolutely may.

113
00:08:12,679 --> 00:08:15,682
- Okay, then, I'm asking.
- Well, okay, then.

114
00:08:15,849 --> 00:08:17,308
Let's see.

115
00:08:17,684 --> 00:08:21,479
We've got five kinds of bromeliad...

116
00:08:21,646 --> 00:08:25,066
...one peperomia,
nine orchid varieties.

117
00:08:26,776 --> 00:08:30,238
You know,
about 130 plants all told.

118
00:08:30,405 --> 00:08:32,741
Which my colleagues here
removed from the swamp.

119
00:08:32,907 --> 00:08:37,495
You're aware it's illegal to remove plants
or animals from state-owned land?

120
00:08:37,662 --> 00:08:39,539
Yeah, and don't forget...

121
00:08:39,706 --> 00:08:43,126
...these plants are all endangered, sir.
Every one of them.

122
00:08:43,293 --> 00:08:47,339
Well, exactly. That's exactly the issue.
This is a state preserve.

123
00:08:47,797 --> 00:08:49,632
Yes, sir. It is.

124
00:08:50,383 --> 00:08:53,136
- But...
- My colleagues are all Seminole Indians.

125
00:08:53,303 --> 00:08:55,597
Did I mention that?
You're familiar, I'm sure...

126
00:08:55,764 --> 00:08:58,224
...with the State of Florida
v. James E. Billie?

127
00:08:58,725 --> 00:09:03,521
So you know that even though Seminole
Chief Billie killed a Florida panther...

128
00:09:03,688 --> 00:09:05,815
...one of what, 40 in the entire world?

129
00:09:05,982 --> 00:09:07,317
- Forty.
- Forty.

130
00:09:07,484 --> 00:09:09,903
The state couldn't successfully
prosecute him...

131
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:12,947
...because, you know, he's an Indian,
and it's his right.

132
00:09:13,114 --> 00:09:18,161
As repugnant as you and I, as white
conservationists, might find his actions.

133
00:09:18,328 --> 00:09:21,122
- But...
- Not to mention the failed attempts...

134
00:09:21,289 --> 00:09:25,710
...on three occasions to prosecute
Seminoles for poaching palm fronds.

135
00:09:25,877 --> 00:09:31,132
Which I believe they use to thatch
the roofs of their traditional chickee huts.

136
00:09:31,675 --> 00:09:34,135
How about that?
With the chickee huts, right?

137
00:09:34,302 --> 00:09:38,390
Yeah, he's right. That's exactly what
we use them for. Chickee huts.

138
00:09:42,977 --> 00:09:44,938
Yeah, but I don't...

139
00:09:45,105 --> 00:09:48,441
I can't let you fellas leave yet.

140
00:09:49,317 --> 00:09:52,779
- Just hold on there a minute.
- Okay.

141
00:09:54,614 --> 00:09:56,991
Charles, is that you?

142
00:09:58,952 --> 00:10:00,787
Did you eat lunch?

143
00:10:01,413 --> 00:10:05,291
I had that shrimp cocktail in the fridge.
Was it yours?

144
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:08,795
I hope not. I couldn't remember,
so I ate it.

145
00:10:08,962 --> 00:10:12,090
Maybe we should write our names
on our food items from now on.

146
00:10:12,257 --> 00:10:14,759
- What's with you?
- My back.

147
00:10:14,968 --> 00:10:19,347
Charles, you'll be glad. I have a plan
to get me out of your house, pronto.

148
00:10:19,514 --> 00:10:24,310
- A job is a plan. Is your plan a job?
- Drum roll, please.

149
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:28,815
I'm gonna be a screenwriter.
Like you.

150
00:10:28,982 --> 00:10:31,901
I know you think this is just
one of my "get rich quick" schemes...

151
00:10:32,068 --> 00:10:33,695
...but I'm doing it right this time.

152
00:10:33,862 --> 00:10:37,657
I'm taking a three-day seminar,
and it's only 500 bucks.

153
00:10:37,824 --> 00:10:40,368
Screenwriting seminars are bullshit.

154
00:10:40,535 --> 00:10:43,538
In theory, I agree with you.
But this one's different.

155
00:10:43,705 --> 00:10:45,665
This one's highly regarded
in the industry.

156
00:10:45,832 --> 00:10:48,084
Donald, don't say "industry."

157
00:10:48,251 --> 00:10:50,211
I'm sorry. I forgot.

158
00:10:50,378 --> 00:10:52,964
Charles, this guy knows screenwriting.

159
00:10:53,131 --> 00:10:55,508
People come from all over
to study with him.

160
00:10:55,675 --> 00:10:58,345
- I'll pay you back as soon as l...
- Let me explain something.

161
00:10:58,511 --> 00:11:02,182
Anybody who says he's got "the answer"
is going to attract desperate people...

162
00:11:02,349 --> 00:11:03,975
...be it in the world of religion...

163
00:11:04,142 --> 00:11:06,519
I just need to lie down
while you explain this to me.

164
00:11:06,686 --> 00:11:08,813
Sorry. I apologize.

165
00:11:09,606 --> 00:11:11,399
Okay, go ahead.

166
00:11:11,566 --> 00:11:14,027
- So...
- Sorry. Okay. Go.

167
00:11:14,194 --> 00:11:15,528
There are no rules, Donald.

168
00:11:15,695 --> 00:11:18,156
And anybody who says there are
is just, you know...

169
00:11:18,365 --> 00:11:21,409
Not rules. Principles.

170
00:11:22,035 --> 00:11:25,872
McKee writes that a rule says,
"You must do it this way."

171
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:30,669
A principle says, "This works
and has through all remembered time."

172
00:11:30,835 --> 00:11:33,838
The script I'm starting,
it's about flowers.

173
00:11:34,714 --> 00:11:37,050
Nobody's ever done a movie
about flowers before.

174
00:11:37,217 --> 00:11:41,054
- So there are no guidelines.
- What about Flowers for Algernon?

175
00:11:41,221 --> 00:11:43,890
Well, that's not about flowers.
And it's not a movie.

176
00:11:44,057 --> 00:11:45,975
I'm sorry. I never saw it.

177
00:11:46,142 --> 00:11:47,560
How...? Okay, keep going.

178
00:11:47,727 --> 00:11:50,355
Look, my point is
that those teachers are dangerous...

179
00:11:50,522 --> 00:11:52,524
...if your goal is to try
to do something new.

180
00:11:52,691 --> 00:11:56,444
A writer should always have that goal.
Writing is a journey into the unknown.

181
00:11:56,611 --> 00:11:59,906
It's not building, you know,
one of your model airplanes.

182
00:12:04,411 --> 00:12:06,913
McKee is a former Fulbright Scholar,
Charles.

183
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:10,208
Are you a former Fulbright Scholar?

184
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:16,589
Say something. I dragged her here,
and now I'm not saying anything.

185
00:12:16,756 --> 00:12:18,591
Make her laugh.
Say something funny.

186
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:22,387
I hate parties, Amelia.
Why did we come here?

187
00:12:22,595 --> 00:12:25,265
Because we're hip, young trendsetters
on the make, aren't we?

188
00:12:25,432 --> 00:12:28,226
More like old losers
sitting on the floor, maybe.

189
00:12:28,393 --> 00:12:33,189
Jesus, Charlie. Speak for yourself.
Okay...

190
00:12:34,357 --> 00:12:36,443
Charlie, we're gonna fix you up.

191
00:12:36,609 --> 00:12:40,989
We're gonna solve the whole Charlie
Kaufman mess for once and for all.

192
00:12:41,156 --> 00:12:42,866
- Okay.
- Okay, let me see.

193
00:12:43,033 --> 00:12:46,453
What do you need?
What, what, what?

194
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,497
Well, I'm glad you took
the orchid script.

195
00:12:49,789 --> 00:12:53,084
I think it will be good for you
to get out of your head.

196
00:12:53,251 --> 00:12:57,547
I think it'll ground you to think about the
bigger picture, about nature and stuff.

197
00:12:57,797 --> 00:13:00,633
I still can't believe they gave me
that job.

198
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:04,679
I mean, after that lunch.
I was sweating insanely.

199
00:13:04,846 --> 00:13:07,724
I was ranting. I was a mess.

200
00:13:07,891 --> 00:13:09,893
You were just nervous
because she was pretty.

201
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:11,853
How do you know she was pretty?

202
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:15,899
After eight months of knowing you,
I think I get what makes you sweat.

203
00:13:16,858 --> 00:13:19,819
Well, whatever.
Well, moving on, what next?

204
00:13:19,986 --> 00:13:23,490
You need a new getup.
This whole flannel shirt thing...

205
00:13:23,656 --> 00:13:27,243
...it's not really doing anything
for you anymore.

206
00:13:30,288 --> 00:13:33,083
Thanks for coming out
with me tonight, Amelia.

207
00:13:49,182 --> 00:13:51,017
To begin.

208
00:13:51,184 --> 00:13:52,519
To begin.

209
00:13:53,144 --> 00:13:54,938
How to start?

210
00:13:56,564 --> 00:13:58,024
I'm hungry.

211
00:13:58,191 --> 00:13:59,651
I should get coffee.

212
00:13:59,818 --> 00:14:01,653
Coffee would help me think.

213
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:05,490
But I should write something first,
then reward myself with coffee.

214
00:14:05,657 --> 00:14:11,204
Coffee and a muffin. Okay,
so I need to establish the themes.

215
00:14:12,747 --> 00:14:14,666
Maybe banana-nut.

216
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:16,918
That's a good muffin.

217
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:22,632
Orchid hunting is a mortal occupation.

218
00:14:25,135 --> 00:14:27,137
Victorian-era orchid hunter
William Arnold...

219
00:14:27,303 --> 00:14:29,973
...drowned on a collecting expedition.

220
00:14:31,307 --> 00:14:34,060
Osmers vanished without a trace
in Asia.

221
00:14:36,813 --> 00:14:42,777
Augustus Margary survived toothache,
rheumatism, pleurisy and dysentery...

222
00:14:44,446 --> 00:14:47,449
...only to be murdered when
he completed his mission...

223
00:14:47,615 --> 00:14:50,493
...and traveled beyond Bhamo.

224
00:14:53,663 --> 00:14:56,332
Laroche loved orchids, but I...

225
00:14:56,499 --> 00:15:00,295
I came to believe he loved the
difficulty and fatality of getting them...

226
00:15:00,462 --> 00:15:04,090
...almost as much as he loved
the orchids themselves.

227
00:15:05,258 --> 00:15:08,094
I've been a professional horticulturist
for, like, 12 years.

228
00:15:09,929 --> 00:15:13,099
I owned my own plant nursery,
which was destroyed by the hurricane.

229
00:15:13,266 --> 00:15:15,393
I'm a professional plant lecturer.

230
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:18,855
I've given over, like, 60 lectures
on the cultivation of plants.

231
00:15:19,022 --> 00:15:22,776
I'm a published author,
both in magazine and book form.

232
00:15:22,942 --> 00:15:25,320
And I have extensive experience
with orchids...

233
00:15:25,487 --> 00:15:30,867
...and the asexual micropropagation
of orchids under aseptic cultures.

234
00:15:31,034 --> 00:15:35,955
That's laboratory work.
It's not at all like your nursery work.

235
00:15:36,831 --> 00:15:39,292
I'm probably the smartest person
I know.

236
00:15:39,918 --> 00:15:42,128
- Thank you.
- You're very welcome.

237
00:15:46,966 --> 00:15:49,344
Mr. Laroche?
I'm Susan Orlean.

238
00:15:49,511 --> 00:15:52,013
I'm a writer for The New Yorker.
It's a magazine that...

239
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:54,265
I'm familiar with The New Yorker.

240
00:15:54,432 --> 00:15:57,644
"The New Yorker?
Yes, The New Yorker." Right?

241
00:15:57,811 --> 00:15:59,437
That's right.

242
00:15:59,646 --> 00:16:03,274
I'm very interested in doing a piece
on your situation here, and...

243
00:16:03,692 --> 00:16:05,151
Yeah? Yeah.

244
00:16:05,318 --> 00:16:07,195
You wanna put this in?

245
00:16:07,362 --> 00:16:09,447
I don't care what goes on here.

246
00:16:09,656 --> 00:16:12,617
I'm right, and I'll take it all the way
to Supreme Court.

247
00:16:12,784 --> 00:16:15,870
Because that judge can screw herself.

248
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:26,089
- That for real would go in?
- Absolutely.

249
00:16:35,015 --> 00:16:37,308
We open on State Road 29.

250
00:16:37,475 --> 00:16:40,770
A battered white van speeds along,
making a sharp, skidding right...

251
00:16:40,937 --> 00:16:43,690
...into the Fakahatchee Strand
State Preserve.

252
00:16:43,857 --> 00:16:47,527
The driver of the van is a skinny man
with no front teeth.

253
00:16:47,944 --> 00:16:50,864
This is John Laroche.

254
00:16:52,741 --> 00:16:54,117
I need a break.

255
00:16:55,201 --> 00:16:59,748
- I loved the Sibelius violin concerto.
- Yeah, me too. It was great.

256
00:16:59,914 --> 00:17:03,335
- The end was a little weird, but...
- Oh, no! God, it was passionate.

257
00:17:03,501 --> 00:17:05,003
It was exultant.

258
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:09,674
The soloist was amazing.
Such beautiful tones. So precise.

259
00:17:09,883 --> 00:17:11,551
God, it blows my mind.

260
00:17:11,718 --> 00:17:14,637
- I wish I could play like that.
- You do.

261
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:18,767
Charlie. I don't.
I'm mediocre at best.

262
00:17:18,933 --> 00:17:21,227
Well, I love listening to you play.

263
00:17:21,394 --> 00:17:23,021
Thanks, Charlie.

264
00:17:25,774 --> 00:17:27,650
Here we are.

265
00:17:31,696 --> 00:17:34,366
What are you up to now, then?

266
00:17:34,574 --> 00:17:39,454
I should probably get to bed.
I have a lot of work to do tomorrow.

267
00:17:39,621 --> 00:17:42,082
Well, good night, then.

268
00:17:50,507 --> 00:17:51,925
I would stay out.

269
00:17:52,092 --> 00:17:55,220
It's just that I've really been struggling
on the script right now.

270
00:17:55,387 --> 00:17:58,807
I've been thinking about it too small,
just writing it like a story about Laroche.

271
00:17:58,973 --> 00:18:02,102
That's not enough. I mean,
I wanted to write about flowers.

272
00:18:02,268 --> 00:18:06,398
Anyway, I can't figure it out, and I
haven't been sleeping very well lately...

273
00:18:06,606 --> 00:18:08,274
...so I thought I should get home...

274
00:18:08,441 --> 00:18:12,570
...and try to get a good night's sleep,
you know. Start fresh in the morning.

275
00:18:12,737 --> 00:18:14,739
Otherwise, I'd stay out.

276
00:18:14,948 --> 00:18:19,035
I understand. I hope you figure it out,
Charlie. I really do.

277
00:18:19,202 --> 00:18:22,247
Thanks. Thanks for coming out
with me and everything.

278
00:18:22,414 --> 00:18:24,290
Sure, it was fun.

279
00:18:24,457 --> 00:18:29,087
So I have to go to Santa Barbara next
weekend for this orchid show up there.

280
00:18:29,254 --> 00:18:32,090
I thought maybe you could come.

281
00:18:32,632 --> 00:18:34,092
No, I...

282
00:18:35,093 --> 00:18:37,804
I don't think I can make it
next weekend.

283
00:18:37,971 --> 00:18:40,223
I don't think I can.

284
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:42,934
I've got something. Sorry.

285
00:18:43,101 --> 00:18:44,686
Okay.

286
00:18:44,853 --> 00:18:47,856
So, well, okay, then.
So good night, then.

287
00:18:48,023 --> 00:18:50,150
Good night, Charlie.

288
00:18:51,776 --> 00:18:53,903
Why didn't I go in?
I'm such a chicken.

289
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:56,906
I'm such an idiot. I should have
kissed her. I've blown it.

290
00:18:57,073 --> 00:18:59,826
I should just go and knock
on her door right now and kiss her.

291
00:18:59,993 --> 00:19:04,456
It would be romantic. Something
we could someday tell our kids.

292
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:07,459
I'm gonna do that right now.

293
00:19:22,307 --> 00:19:25,602
- Thanks for picking me up.
- This van's a piece of shit.

294
00:19:25,769 --> 00:19:28,980
But when I hit the jackpot,
I'll buy myself an awesome car.

295
00:19:29,147 --> 00:19:31,566
Hey, what are you driving?

296
00:19:31,733 --> 00:19:33,526
It's... Well, it's a rental.

297
00:19:33,693 --> 00:19:36,738
- It's a Lumina.
- Awesome.

298
00:19:36,905 --> 00:19:39,741
I think I'll get one of those too.

299
00:19:44,913 --> 00:19:46,331
Here we go.

300
00:19:48,792 --> 00:19:51,753
Where do these people learn
to drive, huh?

301
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:53,755
The world's insane.

302
00:19:53,922 --> 00:19:56,383
So I was impressed to hear...

303
00:19:56,549 --> 00:19:59,177
...how accomplished you are
in the world of horticulture.

304
00:19:59,344 --> 00:20:01,221
The thing you gotta know is...

305
00:20:01,388 --> 00:20:04,307
...my whole life is looking for
a goddamn profitable plant, see?

306
00:20:04,474 --> 00:20:05,767
And that's the ghost.

307
00:20:05,934 --> 00:20:06,976
Why the ghost orchid?

308
00:20:08,895 --> 00:20:11,648
Well, the sucker's rare. You know?

309
00:20:11,815 --> 00:20:15,902
And I'm the only one in the world
who knows how to cultivate it.

310
00:20:16,069 --> 00:20:19,280
See, the idea was, get the Indians
to pull it from the swamp.

311
00:20:19,447 --> 00:20:23,535
I researched it. Long as I don't touch
the plant, Florida can't touch us.

312
00:20:24,077 --> 00:20:28,998
And I stop future poaching by making
the flowers readily available in stores.

313
00:20:29,165 --> 00:20:32,085
I'm a hero, the flowers are saved...

314
00:20:32,252 --> 00:20:34,462
...Laroche and nature win.

315
00:20:35,922 --> 00:20:37,424
Great.

316
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:39,718
Did you get that last part?

317
00:20:39,926 --> 00:20:41,761
Yeah, I sure did.

318
00:20:41,928 --> 00:20:44,973
Orchids are the sexiest flowers
on Earth.

319
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:50,603
The name orchid derives from the
Latin orchis, which means testicle.

320
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:52,188
Hey, Charles.

321
00:20:52,355 --> 00:20:54,107
I pitched my screenplay to Mom.

322
00:20:54,274 --> 00:20:56,109
Don't say "pitch."

323
00:20:56,276 --> 00:20:58,611
Sorry. Anyway, she said it was...

324
00:20:58,778 --> 00:21:00,947
...Silence of the Lambs
meets Psycho.

325
00:21:01,114 --> 00:21:05,201
Maybe you guys could collaborate.
I hear Mom's really good with structure.

326
00:21:07,495 --> 00:21:09,789
So how come Amelia
doesn't come around anymore?

327
00:21:09,956 --> 00:21:13,001
Did you put the moves on her
or something?

328
00:21:37,984 --> 00:21:40,487
I'm looking for John Laroche.

329
00:21:43,448 --> 00:21:45,992
I'm writing an article on John,
and I stopped by.

330
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:47,994
- I hoped I could see him.
- John's not here.

331
00:21:50,163 --> 00:21:53,708
Well, you were at the swamp
with him, weren't you?

332
00:21:53,875 --> 00:21:55,710
I saw you at the courthouse,
that's how I know.

333
00:21:55,877 --> 00:21:57,879
I'm Matthew Osceola.

334
00:21:58,046 --> 00:21:59,964
Susan Orlean. Nice to meet you.

335
00:22:00,131 --> 00:22:02,801
Maybe I could talk to you
for a second.

336
00:22:02,967 --> 00:22:05,637
I'm just trying to get a feel
for the whole operation...

337
00:22:05,804 --> 00:22:08,640
You have very beautiful hair.

338
00:22:12,686 --> 00:22:15,105
Thank you very much.

339
00:22:15,271 --> 00:22:16,981
Thank you. I just...

340
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:21,277
I just washed it this morning.

341
00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:25,031
I just used a new conditioner.

342
00:22:29,202 --> 00:22:31,830
I can see your sadness.

343
00:22:32,247 --> 00:22:33,790
It's lovely.

344
00:22:36,042 --> 00:22:40,130
Well, I'm just tired, that's all.
That's my problem.

345
00:22:40,296 --> 00:22:42,632
So maybe we could chat a little bit...

346
00:22:43,049 --> 00:22:46,886
...and I could get some background...
- I'm not going to talk to you much.

347
00:22:47,053 --> 00:22:48,847
It's not personal.

348
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:51,975
It's the Indian way.

349
00:23:04,154 --> 00:23:06,906
Angraecum sesquipedale.

350
00:23:07,699 --> 00:23:10,076
Beauty! God!

351
00:23:10,243 --> 00:23:12,454
Darwin wrote about this one.

352
00:23:13,038 --> 00:23:17,125
Charles Darwin? Evolution guy?
Hello?

353
00:23:17,292 --> 00:23:19,294
You see that nectary
all the way down there?

354
00:23:19,461 --> 00:23:21,755
Darwin hypothesized a moth...

355
00:23:22,255 --> 00:23:25,467
...with a nose 12 inches long
to pollinate it.

356
00:23:25,759 --> 00:23:27,844
Everyone thought he was a loon.

357
00:23:28,011 --> 00:23:32,432
Then, sure enough, they found
this moth with a 12-inch proboscis.

358
00:23:32,599 --> 00:23:35,643
- "Proboscis" means nose, by the way.
- I know what "proboscis" means.

359
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:39,898
Hey, let's not get off the subject.
This isn't a pissing contest.

360
00:23:40,106 --> 00:23:42,650
The point is,
what's so wonderful...

361
00:23:42,817 --> 00:23:45,904
...is that every one of these flowers
has a specific relationship...

362
00:23:46,071 --> 00:23:47,864
...with the insect that pollinates it.

363
00:23:48,031 --> 00:23:50,784
There's a certain orchid
looks exactly like a certain insect.

364
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:53,661
So the insect is drawn to this flower...

365
00:23:53,828 --> 00:23:56,998
...its double, its soul mate...

366
00:23:57,165 --> 00:24:00,627
...and wants nothing more
than to make love to it.

367
00:24:01,127 --> 00:24:03,338
After the insect flies off...

368
00:24:03,505 --> 00:24:08,176
...it spots another soul-mate flower
and makes love to it, thus pollinating it.

369
00:24:08,343 --> 00:24:11,805
And neither the flower nor the insect
will ever understand...

370
00:24:11,971 --> 00:24:14,933
...the significance
of their lovemaking.

371
00:24:15,225 --> 00:24:18,812
How could they know that because
of their little dance, the world lives?

372
00:24:18,978 --> 00:24:20,814
But it does.

373
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:23,149
By simply doing
what they're designed to do...

374
00:24:23,316 --> 00:24:26,111
...something large
and magnificent happens.

375
00:24:26,277 --> 00:24:28,530
In this sense, they show us
how to live.

376
00:24:28,697 --> 00:24:32,367
How the only barometer
you have is your heart.

377
00:24:32,534 --> 00:24:38,039
How when you spot your flower,
you can't let anything get in your way.

378
00:24:45,505 --> 00:24:48,341
He's really quite a character.
No front teeth.

379
00:24:48,508 --> 00:24:51,678
- Doesn't seem to bother him at all.
- Why doesn't he get them fixed?

380
00:24:51,845 --> 00:24:55,306
It seems almost sociopathic
to make everybody look at that.

381
00:24:55,515 --> 00:24:58,268
Yeah, but he gives
a great blowjob, honey.

382
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:02,605
He is a fascinating character, though.

383
00:25:02,772 --> 00:25:05,066
Sounds like a gold mine, Sue.

384
00:25:05,233 --> 00:25:08,695
It could be. I don't know, you know?
He's...

385
00:25:08,862 --> 00:25:12,991
He lives with his dad, he's obsessed
with his dead mother, and...

386
00:25:13,199 --> 00:25:17,495
He wears his sunglasses on
a little dingle-dangle around his neck.

387
00:25:17,662 --> 00:25:19,330
Loving it.

388
00:25:20,206 --> 00:25:23,418
- Tell them about the van.
- Okay, the van. The van.

389
00:25:23,585 --> 00:25:26,755
- I can't tell about the van. I gotta pee.
- No, tell us about the van.

390
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:30,050
- It's amazing. It's...
- What's in it?

391
00:25:30,216 --> 00:25:33,470
- You did it in the van.
- Shut up.

392
00:25:33,636 --> 00:25:36,222
David, you tell...
Don't you tell them. Don't tell them.

393
00:25:36,389 --> 00:25:37,932
Okay, the van.

394
00:25:38,308 --> 00:25:40,143
David!

395
00:25:42,062 --> 00:25:44,189
This van was filled with junk...

396
00:25:44,397 --> 00:25:45,398
Shut up!

397
00:25:45,565 --> 00:25:49,861
Potting soil. Shovels.
Food wrappers. Fertilizer.

398
00:25:50,028 --> 00:25:53,365
Susie said she hoped
it was fertilizer, anyway.

399
00:25:53,531 --> 00:25:57,160
She said she couldn't be sure. Laroche
had a certain aromatic look about him.

400
00:25:57,327 --> 00:25:58,328
And she said...

401
00:25:58,495 --> 00:26:01,915
She said perhaps his obsessiveness
didn't leave room in his schedule...

402
00:26:02,082 --> 00:26:04,250
...for personal hygiene.

403
00:26:04,417 --> 00:26:08,421
Maybe the orchids got
all the available water.

404
00:26:09,255 --> 00:26:14,719
I wanted to want something as much
as people wanted these plants.

405
00:26:15,595 --> 00:26:17,013
But...

406
00:26:17,681 --> 00:26:20,850
...it isn't part of my constitution.

407
00:26:21,935 --> 00:26:26,356
I suppose I do have
one unembarrassed passion.

408
00:26:28,316 --> 00:26:33,405
I wanna know what it feels like
to care about something passionately.

409
00:26:45,583 --> 00:26:48,336
"Should one be lucky enough
to see a ghost orchid...

410
00:26:48,503 --> 00:26:51,840
...all else will seem eclipsed."

411
00:26:54,467 --> 00:26:57,512
If the ghost orchid
was really a phantom...

412
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:01,975
...it was still such a bewitching one that
it could seduce people to pursue it...

413
00:27:02,142 --> 00:27:05,478
...year after year
and mile after miserable mile.

414
00:27:05,645 --> 00:27:09,107
If it was a real flower,
I wanted to see one.

415
00:27:09,315 --> 00:27:12,902
The reason was not that I love orchids.
I don't even especially like orchids.

416
00:27:13,069 --> 00:27:16,656
What I wanted
was to see this thing...

417
00:27:16,823 --> 00:27:23,163
...that people were drawn to
in such a singular and powerful way.

418
00:27:26,291 --> 00:27:29,419
So how many turtles
did you end up collecting?

419
00:27:29,586 --> 00:27:32,297
I lost interest right after that.

420
00:27:35,091 --> 00:27:38,094
I dropped turtles when I fell
in love with Ice Age fossils.

421
00:27:38,261 --> 00:27:40,805
Collected the shit out of them.

422
00:27:40,972 --> 00:27:44,934
Fossils were the only thing that made
sense to me in this fucked-up world.

423
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:48,938
I ditched fossils
for resilvering old mirrors.

424
00:27:49,105 --> 00:27:51,066
My mom and I
had the largest collection...

425
00:27:51,232 --> 00:27:54,319
...of 19th-century Dutch mirrors
on the planet.

426
00:27:54,527 --> 00:27:57,364
Perhaps you read about us.
Mirror World, October '88?

427
00:27:57,530 --> 00:28:00,158
I got a copy here somewhere.

428
00:28:01,576 --> 00:28:04,954
I guess I'd just like to know
how you can detach from something...

429
00:28:05,121 --> 00:28:07,540
...that you've invested
so much of your soul in.

430
00:28:07,707 --> 00:28:12,212
I mean, didn't you ever miss turtles?

431
00:28:12,379 --> 00:28:16,633
The only thing that made
your 10-year-old life worth living?

432
00:28:17,217 --> 00:28:20,553
Look, I'll tell you a story, all right?

433
00:28:20,762 --> 00:28:26,393
I once fell deeply, you know,
profoundly in love with tropical fish.

434
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:28,687
I had 60 goddamn fish-tanks
in my house.

435
00:28:28,895 --> 00:28:31,564
I'd skin-dive to find just the right ones.

436
00:28:31,731 --> 00:28:37,195
Anisotremus virginicus, Holacanthus
ciliaris, Chaetodon capistratus.

437
00:28:37,362 --> 00:28:39,072
You name it.

438
00:28:39,489 --> 00:28:42,492
Then one day I say, "Fuck fish."

439
00:28:42,659 --> 00:28:46,996
I renounce fish. I vow never
to set foot in that ocean again.

440
00:28:47,163 --> 00:28:49,874
That's how much "fuck fish."

441
00:28:50,834 --> 00:28:55,463
That was 17 years ago, and I have
never since stuck a toe in that ocean.

442
00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:57,841
And I love the ocean.

443
00:28:59,259 --> 00:29:00,927
But why?

444
00:29:02,804 --> 00:29:04,973
Done with fish.

445
00:29:05,932 --> 00:29:10,353
If you'd really loved something,
wouldn't a little bit of it linger?

446
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:13,565
Evidently Laroche's finishes
were downright and absolute.

447
00:29:13,773 --> 00:29:15,233
He just moved on.

448
00:29:15,442 --> 00:29:19,320
I sometimes wished
I could do the same.

449
00:29:24,659 --> 00:29:27,620
Good afternoon.
So, what looks good today?

450
00:29:27,787 --> 00:29:29,622
The key lime pie, please.

451
00:29:29,789 --> 00:29:31,583
A small slice.

452
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:34,377
And a coffee, please.
Skim milk, please.

453
00:29:35,962 --> 00:29:38,840
Orchids. I love orchids.

454
00:29:39,007 --> 00:29:40,633
Cool. That's...

455
00:29:44,679 --> 00:29:47,766
Well, I'll be right back with your pie.

456
00:29:58,318 --> 00:30:01,529
I'm so excited. I've always wanted
to come to an orchid show.

457
00:30:01,946 --> 00:30:04,240
I think these flowers are so sexy.

458
00:30:06,201 --> 00:30:07,994
Let's see what's around back.

459
00:30:31,142 --> 00:30:32,310
What?

460
00:30:32,477 --> 00:30:35,230
- You wanna hear my pitch?
- Go away, goddamn it.

461
00:30:37,524 --> 00:30:39,859
You know, I'm just trying
to do something.

462
00:30:44,864 --> 00:30:47,367
Hey, thanks a lot, buddy. Cool.

463
00:30:47,534 --> 00:30:49,661
Okay, there's this serial killer, right?

464
00:30:49,828 --> 00:30:52,497
Well, no, wait.
And he's being hunted by a cop.

465
00:30:52,706 --> 00:30:56,668
And he's taunting the cop, right?
Sending clues who his next victim is.

466
00:30:56,876 --> 00:30:59,379
He's already holding her hostage
in his creepy basement.

467
00:30:59,546 --> 00:31:02,132
So the cop gets obsessed
with figuring out her identity...

468
00:31:02,298 --> 00:31:04,718
...and in the process
falls in love with her.

469
00:31:04,884 --> 00:31:07,846
Even though he's never even met her.
She becomes like...

470
00:31:08,054 --> 00:31:11,182
Like the unattainable.
Like the Holy Grail.

471
00:31:11,391 --> 00:31:14,936
- It's a little obvious, don't you think?
- Okay, but here's the twist.

472
00:31:15,103 --> 00:31:17,397
We find out that the killer...

473
00:31:17,564 --> 00:31:20,525
...really suffers from
multiple personality disorder. Right?

474
00:31:20,692 --> 00:31:24,237
See, he's actually really the cop
and the girl.

475
00:31:24,404 --> 00:31:27,574
All of them are him.
Isn't that fucked up?

476
00:31:29,075 --> 00:31:33,788
The only idea more overused than
serial killers is multiple personality.

477
00:31:33,955 --> 00:31:36,374
On top of that, you explore
the notion...

478
00:31:36,541 --> 00:31:39,586
...that cop and criminal are
really two aspects of the same person.

479
00:31:39,753 --> 00:31:42,756
See every cop movie ever made
for other examples of this.

480
00:31:42,922 --> 00:31:45,550
Mom called it psychologically taut.

481
00:31:45,717 --> 00:31:49,596
The other thing is, there's no way
to write this. Did you consider that?

482
00:31:49,763 --> 00:31:54,225
I mean, how could you have somebody
held prisoner in a basement...

483
00:31:54,392 --> 00:31:58,438
...and working in a police station
at the same time?

484
00:31:59,773 --> 00:32:02,442
- Trick photography.
- Okay, that's not what I'm asking.

485
00:32:02,609 --> 00:32:05,403
Listen closely.
What I'm asking is:

486
00:32:05,570 --> 00:32:10,408
In the reality of this movie, where
there's only one character, right?

487
00:32:10,575 --> 00:32:12,118
Okay?

488
00:32:12,285 --> 00:32:14,287
How could you...?

489
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:18,041
What exactly would...?

490
00:32:20,126 --> 00:32:21,878
I agree with Mom. Very taut.

491
00:32:22,045 --> 00:32:24,964
Sybil meets, I don't know...
Dressed to Kill.

492
00:32:25,131 --> 00:32:27,384
Cool. I really liked Dressed to Kill.

493
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:31,846
- Until the third act denouement.
- That's not how it's pronounced.

494
00:32:33,431 --> 00:32:35,558
Sorry. L...
Okay, sorry.

495
00:32:41,815 --> 00:32:45,235
- Some key lime pie for you today?
- Okay, yeah. That sounds great.

496
00:32:45,402 --> 00:32:48,113
I'll cut you an extra-large slice.
Preferred customer.

497
00:32:48,279 --> 00:32:51,866
- Thank you. That's really sweet of you.
- Well, I'm just a sweetie, ain't I?

498
00:32:52,492 --> 00:32:55,578
- Still reading about orchids, I hope?
- Yes, I am.

499
00:32:55,745 --> 00:32:58,623
This friend of mine
has this little, tiny pink one...

500
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:01,918
...that grows on a tree branch
just like that.

501
00:33:02,085 --> 00:33:04,212
- I can't remember...
- That's called an epiphyte.

502
00:33:04,379 --> 00:33:06,464
Right. Right!

503
00:33:06,673 --> 00:33:08,299
Boy, you know your stuff.

504
00:33:08,466 --> 00:33:11,636
No, not really. I'm just learning.

505
00:33:11,803 --> 00:33:14,681
Epiphytes grow on trees,
but they're not parasites.

506
00:33:14,848 --> 00:33:17,392
They get all their nourishment
from the air and the rain.

507
00:33:18,059 --> 00:33:21,646
Well, I'm impressed. That's great.

508
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:24,983
There are more than 30,000 kinds
of orchids in the world.

509
00:33:25,316 --> 00:33:28,695
- Wow, that's a lot, huh?
- Yeah. Yeah.

510
00:33:28,862 --> 00:33:30,030
Yeah.

511
00:33:30,196 --> 00:33:35,326
So I'll be right back with an extra-large
slice of key lime pie for my orchid expert.

512
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:38,955
But... So anyway,
I was also wondering...

513
00:33:40,582 --> 00:33:45,045
I'm going up to Santa Barbara this
Saturday for an orchid show, and I...

514
00:33:47,714 --> 00:33:49,090
- I'm sorry.
- Well...

515
00:33:49,257 --> 00:33:53,094
- I apologize. I'm sorry.
- So I'll just be right back with your pie.

516
00:34:03,104 --> 00:34:07,692
There are more than 30,000
known orchid species.

517
00:34:07,859 --> 00:34:10,070
One looks like a turtle.

518
00:34:10,487 --> 00:34:13,156
One looks like a monkey.

519
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:16,076
One looks like an onion.

520
00:34:16,242 --> 00:34:18,161
One looks like a schoolteacher.

521
00:34:18,495 --> 00:34:20,205
One looks like a gymnast.

522
00:34:20,538 --> 00:34:23,333
One looks like that girl in high school
with creamy skin.

523
00:34:23,917 --> 00:34:25,794
One looks like a New York
intellectual...

524
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:29,005
...with whom you do the Sunday
Times crossword puzzle in bed.

525
00:34:29,172 --> 00:34:31,883
One looks like a Midwestern
beauty queen.

526
00:34:32,133 --> 00:34:34,344
One looks like Amelia.

527
00:34:34,511 --> 00:34:36,179
One has eyes that dance.

528
00:34:36,346 --> 00:34:40,058
One has eyes that contain
the sadness of the world.

529
00:34:45,271 --> 00:34:48,358
So I got married,
and me and my beautiful new wife...

530
00:34:48,525 --> 00:34:51,403
...my now ex-wife, the bitch...

531
00:34:52,445 --> 00:34:54,489
...opened up a nursery.

532
00:34:54,656 --> 00:34:57,701
People started coming out
of the woodwork to ask me stuff...

533
00:34:57,867 --> 00:35:01,413
...and admire my plants
and admire me.

534
00:35:03,498 --> 00:35:08,044
I think some people were really spending
time with me because they were lonely.

535
00:35:14,342 --> 00:35:16,928
And you know why I like plants?

536
00:35:19,639 --> 00:35:22,142
Because they're so mutable.

537
00:35:23,768 --> 00:35:27,188
Adaptation's a profound process.

538
00:35:27,647 --> 00:35:29,149
It means you...

539
00:35:29,315 --> 00:35:32,777
...figure out how to thrive in the world.

540
00:35:37,157 --> 00:35:40,243
Yeah, but it's easier for plants.
I mean...

541
00:35:40,410 --> 00:35:42,162
...they have no memory.

542
00:35:43,038 --> 00:35:47,417
You know, they just move on to
whatever's next. But a person, now...

543
00:35:49,169 --> 00:35:52,213
...adapting's almost shameful.
I mean, it's like...

544
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:54,841
...running away.

545
00:36:29,334 --> 00:36:31,670
Keener!

546
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:45,850
Hey, man.

547
00:36:46,309 --> 00:36:48,269
Please don't hit
on crew members, Donald.

548
00:36:48,436 --> 00:36:52,357
What, the makeup girl?
She was hitting on me, bro.

549
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,777
Don't embarrass me.
I have to work with these people.

550
00:36:55,944 --> 00:36:59,239
I won't. Anyway, listen...

551
00:36:59,406 --> 00:37:03,243
...I meant to ask you,
I need a cool way to kill people.

552
00:37:05,245 --> 00:37:08,039
Don't worry. For my script.

553
00:37:08,206 --> 00:37:10,375
I don't write that kind of stuff.

554
00:37:10,542 --> 00:37:14,254
Come on, man, please?
You're the genius.

555
00:37:15,255 --> 00:37:18,008
Here you go: The killer's
a literature professor.

556
00:37:18,174 --> 00:37:22,053
He cuts off little chunks from his
victim's bodies until they die.

557
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:25,390
He calls himself
"The Deconstructionist."

558
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:31,021
- That's kind of good. I like that.
- See, I was kidding, Donald.

559
00:37:32,188 --> 00:37:34,774
Okay. Sorry.

560
00:37:34,941 --> 00:37:37,152
You got me.

561
00:37:38,778 --> 00:37:41,406
Do you mind if I use it, though?

562
00:37:48,872 --> 00:37:52,667
- It's really good.
- I tried to split the Cassie scene in half...

563
00:37:52,834 --> 00:37:56,129
...from the beginning to the end.
- I saw that. Why did you do that?

564
00:37:56,296 --> 00:38:00,133
Because I wanted there to be more
tension. And then you pick it up later...

565
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:02,802
- But are you changing...?
- Keeps more tension.

566
00:38:02,969 --> 00:38:06,598
That way the audience
gets stuck early on.

567
00:38:06,931 --> 00:38:08,808
- You like it?
- I really like it.

568
00:38:18,818 --> 00:38:20,820
You look hot tonight, baby.

569
00:38:20,987 --> 00:38:25,033
Thanks, Donald.
That's swell of you to say.

570
00:38:25,784 --> 00:38:29,079
- Don't you think she's hot, bro?
- I'm heading home, Donald.

571
00:38:29,245 --> 00:38:31,331
Really? Come on.

572
00:38:31,498 --> 00:38:34,209
Hey, it's Amelia.

573
00:38:34,918 --> 00:38:36,169
Hey, Amelia!

574
00:38:36,586 --> 00:38:39,964
Hey, Donald.
Hey, Charlie.

575
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:45,136
- Hey. Hi there.
- God, Amelia, we don't see you anymore.

576
00:38:45,345 --> 00:38:49,182
- It's good to see you.
- This is my girlfriend, Caroline.

577
00:38:49,349 --> 00:38:51,851
- She's a makeup artist for the movies.
- Hi.

578
00:38:53,019 --> 00:38:54,938
Hi.

579
00:38:55,105 --> 00:38:56,731
This is David, my friend.

580
00:38:57,941 --> 00:38:59,776
- Hi.
- Hey. Nice to meet you.

581
00:38:59,943 --> 00:39:02,612
- Amelia's talked a lot about you.
- Hi, I'm Donald.

582
00:39:02,779 --> 00:39:05,281
- Hey.
- Caroline.

583
00:39:05,448 --> 00:39:07,033
- Cool camera.
- So how are you?

584
00:39:07,867 --> 00:39:10,954
- You know me, a mess.
- Charlie...

585
00:39:11,121 --> 00:39:13,540
...it's really good to see you.
Is the work good?

586
00:39:13,707 --> 00:39:15,834
It's a disaster.
I don't know what I'm doing.

587
00:39:16,042 --> 00:39:18,670
But, anyway, it's my problem.
I don't want to bore you.

588
00:39:18,837 --> 00:39:22,549
You have your own stuff, right? I mean,
we both have our own separate stuff.

589
00:39:22,716 --> 00:39:25,552
Anyway, I should go. I was just
heading home to do some work.

590
00:39:25,719 --> 00:39:28,972
- You coming?
- No, I'm gonna stay at Caroline's tonight.

591
00:39:29,139 --> 00:39:31,933
A little push, push in the bush.

592
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:35,478
Donald, you're such a tard!

593
00:39:35,645 --> 00:39:37,439
See you, Charlie.

594
00:39:42,068 --> 00:39:44,821
To write about a flower,
to dramatize a flower...

595
00:39:44,988 --> 00:39:46,906
...I have to show the flower's arc.

596
00:39:47,073 --> 00:39:50,243
And the flower's arc stretches back
to the beginning of life.

597
00:39:50,410 --> 00:39:53,538
How did this flower get here?
What was its journey?

598
00:39:54,247 --> 00:39:57,250
Therefore, I should infer
from analogy...

599
00:39:59,419 --> 00:40:03,381
...that probably all the organic beings
which have ever lived on this Earth...

600
00:40:03,590 --> 00:40:08,887
...have descended
from some one primordial form...

601
00:40:09,054 --> 00:40:11,931
...into which life was first breathed.

602
00:40:12,098 --> 00:40:14,934
It is a journey of evolution.
Adaptation.

603
00:40:15,101 --> 00:40:19,230
The journey we all take. A journey
that unites each and every one of us.

604
00:40:19,397 --> 00:40:22,817
Darwin writes that we all come
from the very first single-cell organism.

605
00:40:23,401 --> 00:40:24,736
Yet here I am.

606
00:40:24,986 --> 00:40:27,530
And there's Laroche.
There's Orlean.

607
00:40:27,697 --> 00:40:31,326
And there's the ghost orchid.
All trapped in our own bodies...

608
00:40:31,493 --> 00:40:34,579
...in moments in history.
That's it.

609
00:40:34,788 --> 00:40:38,792
That's what I need to do.
Tie all of history together.

610
00:40:40,794 --> 00:40:43,421
Start right before
life begins on the planet.

611
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:44,881
All is...

612
00:40:45,048 --> 00:40:47,884
...lifeless.
And then, like, life begins...

613
00:40:48,051 --> 00:40:50,178
...with organisms.
Those little single-cell ones.

614
00:40:50,345 --> 00:40:53,348
And it's before sex, because,
like, everything was asexual.

615
00:40:53,515 --> 00:40:55,892
From there we go to bigger things.
Jellyfish.

616
00:40:56,059 --> 00:40:58,770
Then that fish that got legs
and crawled out on the land.

617
00:40:58,937 --> 00:41:02,190
And then we see,
you know, like, dinosaurs.

618
00:41:02,357 --> 00:41:07,112
And then they're around for a long time.
Then an asteroid comes and:

619
00:41:07,278 --> 00:41:10,448
- The insects, the mammals,
the primates, monkeys.

620
00:41:10,657 --> 00:41:14,119
The simple monkeys. Old-fashioned
monkeys giving way to the new ones.

621
00:41:14,285 --> 00:41:16,746
Whatever. And then apes.
Whatever. And man.

622
00:41:16,913 --> 00:41:21,418
Then we see the whole history of
human civilization: Hunting, war, love...

623
00:41:21,584 --> 00:41:23,712
...heartache, disease,
loneliness, technology.

624
00:41:23,878 --> 00:41:27,841
And we end with Susan Orlean
in her office at The New Yorker...

625
00:41:28,008 --> 00:41:30,427
...writing about flowers, and bang!
The movie begins.

626
00:41:30,593 --> 00:41:34,180
This is the breakthrough I've been
hoping for. It's never been done.

627
00:41:34,347 --> 00:41:37,434
McKee is a genius!

628
00:41:37,892 --> 00:41:42,647
And hilarious. He just comes up with all
these great jokes, and everybody laughs.

629
00:41:43,523 --> 00:41:45,984
But he's serious too, Charles.
You'd love him.

630
00:41:46,151 --> 00:41:48,945
He's all for originality, just like you.

631
00:41:49,112 --> 00:41:53,033
But he says we have to realize
that we all write in a genre...

632
00:41:53,199 --> 00:41:56,327
...and we must find our originality
within that genre.

633
00:41:58,288 --> 00:42:02,000
There hasn't been a new genre since
Fellini invented the mockumentary.

634
00:42:02,167 --> 00:42:04,794
My genre's thriller. What's yours?

635
00:42:04,961 --> 00:42:08,965
You and I share the same DNA.

636
00:42:09,716 --> 00:42:12,594
Is there anything more lonely than that?

637
00:42:12,761 --> 00:42:14,179
What'd you say, bro?

638
00:42:20,518 --> 00:42:22,520
- Yeah?
- Hey.

639
00:42:22,729 --> 00:42:25,440
Hey, Susie-Q.

640
00:42:25,648 --> 00:42:26,649
What you up to?

641
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:31,029
I don't wanna bother you. Just thought
I'd call and get some more info.

642
00:42:32,113 --> 00:42:36,409
I think you say some
pretty smart things, John.

643
00:42:36,576 --> 00:42:38,536
Yeah, smartest guy I know, huh?

644
00:42:41,539 --> 00:42:43,625
So...

645
00:42:43,833 --> 00:42:46,586
...whatever happened
to your nursery?

646
00:42:50,131 --> 00:42:52,467
It was going pretty well.

647
00:42:52,634 --> 00:42:57,472
But, you know, sometimes bad
things happen, darkness descends.

648
00:43:06,773 --> 00:43:08,733
Nursery business good, Johnny?

649
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:11,152
Everything's good, Uncle Jim.

650
00:43:11,319 --> 00:43:13,780
This last year's been a dream.

651
00:43:13,947 --> 00:43:16,700
I'm telling you.
Finally pulling out of debt.

652
00:43:16,866 --> 00:43:19,869
Amen, honey.
I'm so proud of you two, and...

653
00:43:36,886 --> 00:43:38,930
No, ma'am. I'm sorry,
I can't answer that.

654
00:43:39,097 --> 00:43:40,682
- Stay right there.
- Hey.

655
00:43:42,142 --> 00:43:45,020
- Hold it. Which ones are dead?
- Sir, please, don't move.

656
00:43:45,186 --> 00:43:49,274
- Which ones are dead?
- Let's move it!

657
00:43:52,944 --> 00:43:57,699
I killed my mom, you know,
and my uncle.

658
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:01,786
That's how I lost my front teeth.

659
00:44:03,872 --> 00:44:08,710
And my wife was in a coma
for, like, three weeks.

660
00:44:09,544 --> 00:44:13,298
And she divorced me soon after
she regained consciousness.

661
00:44:26,895 --> 00:44:32,442
Well, I think if I almost died,
I would leave my marriage too.

662
00:44:34,361 --> 00:44:36,321
Why?

663
00:44:36,821 --> 00:44:39,157
Because I could.

664
00:44:39,324 --> 00:44:43,244
Because it's like a free pass.
Nobody can judge you...

665
00:44:43,411 --> 00:44:46,790
...if you almost died.

666
00:44:46,956 --> 00:44:49,709
Well, I judged her.

667
00:44:51,044 --> 00:44:53,129
Maybe I was being judged too.

668
00:44:55,048 --> 00:44:59,678
It was like a month after that, Hurricane
Andrew came along and just...

669
00:44:59,844 --> 00:45:02,222
...swooped down
like an angel of God...

670
00:45:04,265 --> 00:45:08,061
...and just wiped out everything
I had left.

671
00:45:09,562 --> 00:45:11,606
Everything.

672
00:45:11,773 --> 00:45:15,360
I knew it'd break my heart
to start another nursery...

673
00:45:15,527 --> 00:45:18,405
...so, you know,
when the Seminoles called...

674
00:45:18,571 --> 00:45:24,035
...they wanted a white guy or an expert
to get their nursery going, I took the job.

675
00:45:24,244 --> 00:45:29,124
I wasn't gonna give them a
conventional little potted-plant place.

676
00:45:29,874 --> 00:45:32,043
I was gonna give them something...

677
00:45:32,210 --> 00:45:34,921
...amazing, you know?

678
00:45:35,088 --> 00:45:38,299
Yeah, I know, John.

679
00:45:39,342 --> 00:45:40,760
I know.

680
00:45:40,927 --> 00:45:43,680
"I was going to give them
something amazing."

681
00:45:46,099 --> 00:45:49,185
It's beautifully written.
You have such a unique voice.

682
00:45:49,352 --> 00:45:52,022
Thank you very much.

683
00:45:52,188 --> 00:45:55,400
- We're big fans.
- Thank you.

684
00:45:55,567 --> 00:45:58,153
Laroche is such a fun character.

685
00:45:59,154 --> 00:46:01,573
- Yeah.
- It's funny and fresh.

686
00:46:01,948 --> 00:46:04,284
And sad in a way.

687
00:46:04,576 --> 00:46:06,578
So we were wondering what's next.

688
00:46:06,745 --> 00:46:09,748
Well, Random House has asked me...

689
00:46:09,956 --> 00:46:12,542
...to expand it into a book,
so I'm gonna be doing that.

690
00:46:12,709 --> 00:46:15,712
- And...
- Susan, we would like to option this.

691
00:46:18,006 --> 00:46:21,301
- You wanna make it into a movie?
- Into a movie.

692
00:46:21,468 --> 00:46:23,178
Oh, God!

693
00:46:24,304 --> 00:46:27,182
- That's really...
- How does that sound?

694
00:46:27,349 --> 00:46:29,225
- That's very exciting.
- Good.

695
00:46:29,392 --> 00:46:33,438
It's just comical. I hadn't thought of it.
I've never written a screenplay before.

696
00:46:33,605 --> 00:46:37,525
Don't worry about that. We have
screenwriters to write the screenplay.

697
00:46:41,738 --> 00:46:44,324
Hey, superstar.
It's Marty, super agent.

698
00:46:44,491 --> 00:46:47,494
I just wanna remind you
it's been 13 weeks...

699
00:46:47,660 --> 00:46:49,454
...and Valerie's anxious
to see a draft.

700
00:46:49,621 --> 00:46:52,665
So if you could wrap things up and
get it to her by Monday, that'd be great.

701
00:46:52,832 --> 00:46:56,336
Call me when you get this.
Adios, amigo.

702
00:47:00,382 --> 00:47:04,386
What? What'd you laugh at?

703
00:47:05,679 --> 00:47:07,597
- You're a genius.
- Which line?

704
00:47:07,764 --> 00:47:09,391
You're a genius.
You're a genius.

705
00:47:35,750 --> 00:47:38,211
"We see orchid hunter
Augustus Margary.

706
00:47:38,378 --> 00:47:42,841
He wears a filthy, spittle-soaked
rag around his head to quell the pain.

707
00:47:43,049 --> 00:47:46,720
The back of his trousers are stained
greasy black from an anal leakage...

708
00:47:46,886 --> 00:47:48,471
...due to dysentery.

709
00:47:48,638 --> 00:47:54,269
He moans with each tentative step
through the overgrown jungle."

710
00:47:54,561 --> 00:47:56,021
I'm fucked.

711
00:47:56,187 --> 00:48:00,233
We open with Laroche. He's funny.
He says, "I love to mutate plants."

712
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:03,319
He says, "Mutation is fun."
Okay, we show flowers and... Okay.

713
00:48:03,486 --> 00:48:05,363
We have to have the court case.
We show Laroche.

714
00:48:05,530 --> 00:48:08,241
He says, "I was mutated as a baby.
That's why I'm so smart."

715
00:48:08,408 --> 00:48:11,161
That's funny. Okay, we open
at the beginning of time. No!

716
00:48:11,327 --> 00:48:13,872
- Laroche is driving into the swamp.
- Crazy white man!

717
00:48:20,795 --> 00:48:24,007
I don't know how to adapt this.
I should have stuck with my own stuff.

718
00:48:24,174 --> 00:48:26,259
I don't know why I thought
I could write this.

719
00:48:26,426 --> 00:48:27,635
See her?

720
00:48:28,511 --> 00:48:30,972
I fucked her up the ass.

721
00:48:31,139 --> 00:48:33,224
No. I'm kidding.

722
00:48:35,518 --> 00:48:37,937
Maybe I can help.

723
00:48:43,818 --> 00:48:46,613
It's about flowers.

724
00:48:47,155 --> 00:48:49,282
Okay.

725
00:48:49,866 --> 00:48:53,995
But it's not only about flowers, right?
You have the crazy plant-nut guy, right?

726
00:48:54,162 --> 00:48:56,539
He's funny. Right?

727
00:49:00,293 --> 00:49:03,755
"There's not nearly enough of him
to fill a book."

728
00:49:03,922 --> 00:49:08,718
So Orlean "digresses in long
passages." Blah, blah, blah.

729
00:49:08,885 --> 00:49:11,471
"No narrative unites these passages."
New York Times Book Review.

730
00:49:11,638 --> 00:49:15,308
I can't structure this. It's that
sprawling New Yorker shit.

731
00:49:15,475 --> 00:49:17,560
Man, I'd fuck her up the ass.

732
00:49:20,105 --> 00:49:23,024
- Sorry.
- The book has no story. There's no story.

733
00:49:23,191 --> 00:49:25,151
All right. Make one up.

734
00:49:25,318 --> 00:49:29,114
I mean, nobody in this town
can make up a crazy story like you.

735
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:33,326
- You're the king of that.
- No, I didn't want to do that this time.

736
00:49:33,493 --> 00:49:37,914
It's someone else's material.
I have a responsibility to Susan...

737
00:49:38,081 --> 00:49:42,293
Anyway, I wanted to grow as a writer.
I wanted to do something simple.

738
00:49:42,460 --> 00:49:45,588
Show people how amazing
flowers are.

739
00:49:46,339 --> 00:49:48,049
Are they amazing?

740
00:49:50,385 --> 00:49:53,888
I don't know. I think they are.

741
00:49:57,434 --> 00:50:00,395
- I need you to get me out of this.
- All right.

742
00:50:01,938 --> 00:50:04,566
Charlie, you've been stringing
them along for months now.

743
00:50:04,733 --> 00:50:09,362
Not to give them anything at this
point would be a terrible career move.

744
00:50:17,787 --> 00:50:19,956
Hey, my script's going amazing.

745
00:50:20,123 --> 00:50:22,334
Right now, I'm working out
an image system.

746
00:50:22,542 --> 00:50:25,587
Because of my multiple personality
theme, I've chosen a motif...

747
00:50:25,754 --> 00:50:29,841
...of broken mirrors to show my
protagonist's fragmented self.

748
00:50:30,008 --> 00:50:34,262
Bob says an image system increases
the complexity of an aesthetic emotion.

749
00:50:34,429 --> 00:50:36,598
- Bob says...
- You sound like you're in a cult.

750
00:50:36,765 --> 00:50:39,893
No, it's just good writing technique.

751
00:50:40,060 --> 00:50:43,313
I made you a copy
of McKee's 10 Commandments.

752
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:45,982
I posted one over
both our work areas.

753
00:50:55,784 --> 00:50:57,786
You shouldn't have done that.

754
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:04,125
Because it's extremely helpful.
Hey, Charles, I'm putting a song on.

755
00:51:04,292 --> 00:51:05,585
"Happy Together."

756
00:51:05,752 --> 00:51:08,755
Like when characters sing songs
in their pajamas and dance around.

757
00:51:08,922 --> 00:51:10,632
I thought it'd break the tension.

758
00:51:10,799 --> 00:51:14,135
At first I was nervous
about putting a song in a thriller...

759
00:51:14,302 --> 00:51:18,890
...but Bob says that Casablanca, one of
the greatest screenplays ever written...

760
00:51:19,099 --> 00:51:22,227
...did exactly that.
Mixed genres.

761
00:51:22,394 --> 00:51:24,562
I haven't slept in a week, Donald.

762
00:51:24,729 --> 00:51:27,607
- I need to go to bed.
- Okay.

763
00:51:28,233 --> 00:51:29,984
Good night.

764
00:51:36,157 --> 00:51:38,743
- Yeah?
- Hi.

765
00:51:38,910 --> 00:51:40,912
John, it's Susan again.

766
00:51:41,121 --> 00:51:44,124
Hey, Susie-Q.

767
00:51:45,208 --> 00:51:46,918
How's it going?

768
00:51:47,293 --> 00:51:50,296
Great. I'm training myself
on the Internet.

769
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:53,216
It's fascinating.
I'm doing pornography.

770
00:51:53,383 --> 00:51:57,429
It's amazing how much these suckers
will pay for photographs of chicks.

771
00:51:57,595 --> 00:52:01,391
It doesn't matter if they're fat
or ugly or what.

772
00:52:01,558 --> 00:52:03,226
Well, that sounds good.

773
00:52:03,393 --> 00:52:06,062
It's great, is what it is.

774
00:52:06,229 --> 00:52:10,692
Listen, John, I hate feeling like
I'm being a pain to you, but I...

775
00:52:10,859 --> 00:52:12,694
I still haven't seen a ghost.

776
00:52:12,986 --> 00:52:17,615
- Yeah?
- And I was hoping maybe you'd...

777
00:52:17,782 --> 00:52:19,034
Yeah.

778
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:20,952
Yeah, I'll take you in.

779
00:52:21,161 --> 00:52:23,872
- Tomorrow.
- Really?

780
00:52:24,873 --> 00:52:28,293
Thank you so much.

781
00:52:28,460 --> 00:52:29,919
Oh, John.

782
00:52:31,004 --> 00:52:32,630
Damn it.

783
00:52:44,309 --> 00:52:47,979
There are too many ideas
and things and people.

784
00:52:48,146 --> 00:52:50,023
Too many directions to go.

785
00:52:50,190 --> 00:52:54,861
I was starting to believe the reason
it matters to care about something...

786
00:52:55,195 --> 00:52:57,322
...is that it whittles the world down...

787
00:52:57,530 --> 00:53:01,159
...to a more manageable size.

788
00:53:01,326 --> 00:53:05,121
Such sweet, sad insights.

789
00:53:06,289 --> 00:53:08,708
So true.

790
00:53:21,721 --> 00:53:24,641
I like looking at you.

791
00:53:26,059 --> 00:53:28,895
I like looking at you too, Charlie.

792
00:54:06,891 --> 00:54:08,560
I don't know how to do this.

793
00:54:09,102 --> 00:54:12,063
I'm afraid I'll disappoint you.

794
00:54:12,230 --> 00:54:15,400
You've written a beautiful book.

795
00:54:15,608 --> 00:54:18,194
I can't sleep.

796
00:54:19,779 --> 00:54:22,824
I'm losing my hair.
I'm fat and repulsive.

797
00:54:22,991 --> 00:54:26,578
Shh. You're not. You're not.

798
00:54:27,746 --> 00:54:32,167
Just whittle it down, you know?

799
00:54:32,334 --> 00:54:34,794
Focus on one thing in the story.

800
00:54:35,462 --> 00:54:38,006
Find that one thing...

801
00:54:38,173 --> 00:54:41,551
...that you care passionately about...

802
00:54:41,718 --> 00:54:43,803
...and then write about that.

803
00:54:43,970 --> 00:54:47,265
We see Susan Orlean:
Delicate, haunted by loneliness...

804
00:54:47,432 --> 00:54:48,892
...fragile, beautiful.

805
00:54:49,059 --> 00:54:52,979
She lies awake next to her sleeping,
insensitive husband.

806
00:54:53,146 --> 00:54:54,314
Her voice-over begins:

807
00:54:54,856 --> 00:54:58,651
"I suppose I do
have one unembarrassed passion.

808
00:54:59,235 --> 00:55:03,323
I want to know how it feels to care
about something passionately."

809
00:55:06,951 --> 00:55:09,287
- Hey.
- Morning.

810
00:55:09,454 --> 00:55:13,958
Hey, you two. Up early for a change?

811
00:55:14,167 --> 00:55:18,672
- You seem chipper.
- I'm good. I have some new ideas.

812
00:55:18,838 --> 00:55:23,760
God, you guys are so smart.
It's like a brain factory in here.

813
00:55:23,927 --> 00:55:28,598
- I got some ideas too this morning.
- He got really, really good ones.

814
00:55:28,765 --> 00:55:31,184
You know, in a Donald sort of way.

815
00:55:31,351 --> 00:55:33,978
I'm putting...
Hey! What?

816
00:55:36,147 --> 00:55:39,109
I'm putting in a chase sequence.
So the killer...

817
00:55:39,275 --> 00:55:42,696
...flees on horseback with the girl.
The cop's after them on a motorcycle.

818
00:55:42,862 --> 00:55:45,490
And it's like a battle between
motors and horses.

819
00:55:45,699 --> 00:55:48,451
Like technology versus horse.

820
00:55:48,618 --> 00:55:50,954
And they're still all one person, right?

821
00:55:51,538 --> 00:55:53,581
Well, that's the big payoff.

822
00:55:53,748 --> 00:55:56,543
- It sounds exciting.
- Thanks, man.

823
00:55:56,710 --> 00:55:59,754
- Thanks.
- See, I told you he was gonna like it.

824
00:56:00,380 --> 00:56:05,176
- You're my muse. You are.
- I love being your muse.

825
00:56:05,593 --> 00:56:08,179
I'm so happy about that.

826
00:56:09,556 --> 00:56:12,058
I'm picking up an order for Kaufman.

827
00:56:30,285 --> 00:56:32,203
- Valerie.
- Hi, Charlie.

828
00:56:32,370 --> 00:56:34,289
It's quite a coincidence
bumping into you.

829
00:56:34,456 --> 00:56:37,083
I'm sorry I didn't call you back.
I was away last week.

830
00:56:37,250 --> 00:56:39,252
- That's okay.
- I meant to because...

831
00:56:39,419 --> 00:56:41,880
...things are going really well now,
and I wanted you to know.

832
00:56:42,047 --> 00:56:44,174
Well, that's great.
I'm anxious to see something.
