1
00:02:17,437 --> 00:02:20,474
<i>Now, when people</i>
<i>think of New Jersey,</i>
<i>they think of North Jersey.</i>

2
00:02:20,508 --> 00:02:24,277
<i>The highways, the cities,</i>
<i>the oil refineries.</i>

3
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:27,180
<i>You know, Springsteen,</i>
The Sopranos.

4
00:02:27,214 --> 00:02:28,750
That's North Jersey.

5
00:02:28,783 --> 00:02:33,955
But you have South Jersey,
which is basically
a different State.

6
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:37,190
But it's one huge Pine forest.

7
00:02:43,531 --> 00:02:48,301
<i>If you get into</i>
<i>certain parts of it at night,</i>
<i>I mean, it is pitch black.</i>

8
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:50,270
<i>You don't hear</i>
<i>highway sounds,</i>

9
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:51,673
<i>you don't see anything.</i>

10
00:02:53,775 --> 00:02:56,176
<i>So that too has</i>
<i>got a kind of...</i>

11
00:02:57,078 --> 00:03:00,148
<i>romantic, otherworldly</i>
<i>feeling to it,</i>

12
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:03,751
<i>that maybe</i>
<i>there are creatures</i>
<i>out here.</i>

13
00:03:03,785 --> 00:03:06,087
<i>Maybe there are</i>
<i>monsters out here.</i>

14
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:13,094
Well, the Pine Barrens
really is a peculiar place.

15
00:03:13,127 --> 00:03:17,598
And although New Jersey
is the most densely populated
State in the union,

16
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:23,604
the Pine Barrens remains
very, very sparsely populated
part of the State.

17
00:03:30,178 --> 00:03:32,547
<i>I think that</i>
<i>it's considered a no man's land</i>

18
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:40,021
<i>because of the vast expanse</i>
<i>of forest in an otherwise</i>
<i>heavily human dense area.</i>

19
00:03:40,054 --> 00:03:42,090
We typically think of
the Northeastern seaboard

20
00:03:42,123 --> 00:03:46,226
as a really dense space
for human population.

21
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:50,798
It's not like the Southeast,
or really the central area
of the United States,

22
00:03:50,832 --> 00:03:52,767
where communities
are really spread out.

23
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:59,272
So, to have such a wide expanse
of space that's more or less
human unoccupied,

24
00:03:59,306 --> 00:04:03,243
<i>it can kind of gain</i>
<i>this life of its own,</i>

25
00:04:03,276 --> 00:04:07,849
<i>or this community understanding</i>
<i>that it's not a safe place,</i>

26
00:04:07,882 --> 00:04:10,350
<i>that it's not a place</i>
<i>where humans are welcome.</i>

27
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:14,655
<i>Where it really belongs</i>
<i>to nature or the unexplored</i>
<i>or the unknown.</i>

28
00:04:17,058 --> 00:04:20,762
<i>There's some really amazing</i>
<i>folklore books</i>
<i>about the Pine Barrens</i>

29
00:04:20,795 --> 00:04:23,998
<i>because it has</i>
<i>a really fascinating</i>
<i>representation</i>

30
00:04:24,031 --> 00:04:27,400
<i>in popular culture</i>
<i>as an incredibly haunted place,</i>

31
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:31,205
<i>for good reason, in that</i>
<i>when industry moved</i>
<i>out of that region</i>

32
00:04:31,239 --> 00:04:35,243
<i>the forest overgrew</i>
<i>and overtook a lot</i>
<i>of the industry buildings</i>

33
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:40,181
<i>that were constructed to</i>
<i>support the steel production</i>
<i>in that area.</i>

34
00:04:47,021 --> 00:04:48,455
The Pine Barrens.

35
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:52,425
I grew up in the Hudson Valley
of New York, and so
I was going around

36
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:55,930
and looking for,
you know, ghosts
and those sort of things there.

37
00:04:55,963 --> 00:04:58,666
<i>As I got older and got</i>
<i>a driver's license</i>

38
00:04:58,699 --> 00:05:00,768
<i>I started expanding</i>
<i>my horizons.</i>

39
00:05:00,802 --> 00:05:04,539
<i>And, oddly enough,</i>
<i>in the early 80s,</i>

40
00:05:04,572 --> 00:05:08,109
<i>the Meadowlands area</i>
<i>of New Jersey,</i>

41
00:05:08,142 --> 00:05:10,545
<i>sort of became a place</i>
<i>where if you didn't want to go</i>
<i>into New York City</i>

42
00:05:10,578 --> 00:05:13,981
<i>for a concert</i>
<i>or for a hockey event,</i>
<i>you could go to New Jersey.</i>

43
00:05:14,682 --> 00:05:17,018
<i>And so I started doing that</i>

44
00:05:17,051 --> 00:05:20,721
<i>and then found</i>
<i>that the hockey team</i>
<i>was the New Jersey Devils</i>

45
00:05:20,755 --> 00:05:25,860
<i>that were named</i>
<i>after the Leeds Devil</i>
<i>and I was blown away by that.</i>

46
00:05:25,893 --> 00:05:27,829
<i>I'm like, wait a second,</i>
<i>what's the story there?</i>

47
00:05:27,862 --> 00:05:29,496
<i>And they started saying,</i>
<i>"Well, yeah,</i>

48
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:33,100
<i>if you go out</i>
<i>to the Pine Barrens,</i>
<i>that's where this thing lives."</i>

49
00:05:33,134 --> 00:05:37,138
<i>And I thought, okay,</i>
<i>well, why hasn't</i>
<i>anybody found it yet?</i>

50
00:05:37,171 --> 00:05:38,539
<i>And thinking that</i>
<i>the Pine Barrens</i>

51
00:05:38,573 --> 00:05:40,875
<i>was going to be</i>
<i>just a little stretch</i>
<i>of woods,</i>

52
00:05:40,908 --> 00:05:44,645
<i>a couple of acres or something</i>
<i>like that, and then went into</i>
<i>the Pine Barrens,</i>

53
00:05:44,679 --> 00:05:46,681
<i>and it was like going into</i>
<i>another world.</i>

54
00:05:46,714 --> 00:05:48,316
<i>I think a devil</i>
<i>could live back in here</i>

55
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,818
<i>if there was something,</i>
<i>as well as all other sorts</i>
<i>of monsters.</i>

56
00:05:50,852 --> 00:05:55,289
<i>I mean, you could go forever</i>
<i>back there and not find</i>
<i>any other people.</i>

57
00:05:55,323 --> 00:06:00,393
There's really no other legend
like the legend
of the Jersey Devil.

58
00:06:00,427 --> 00:06:09,070
And, you know,
it's a unique legend in a unique
geographical location.

59
00:06:09,103 --> 00:06:12,707
<i>I think the Jersey Devil</i>
<i>is kind of a</i>
<i>really good emblem,</i>

60
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:18,145
<i>to kind of represent</i>
<i>how interesting and unique</i>
<i>the Pine Barrens is.</i>

61
00:06:23,618 --> 00:06:27,855
The creature itself
is kind of horsey,

62
00:06:27,889 --> 00:06:31,058
sort of like a deer with wings.

63
00:06:31,092 --> 00:06:33,861
But a lot of people have
actually claimed

64
00:06:33,895 --> 00:06:36,764
<i>that what they are seeing</i>
<i>is a creature about the size</i>

65
00:06:36,797 --> 00:06:42,837
<i>of a Collie</i>
<i>or a German Shepherd that has</i>
<i>a head more like a horse.</i>

66
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:44,305
<i>It has horns.</i>

67
00:06:44,338 --> 00:06:46,707
Head of a horse.
It's got a head of a...

68
00:06:46,741 --> 00:06:52,346
I've seen a head of a dog,
I saw a head of an ostrich,
I mean and cloven hooves.

69
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:56,884
<i>And it's got</i>
<i>typically bright red eyes,</i>

70
00:06:56,918 --> 00:06:59,020
some kind of goat-like features,

71
00:06:59,053 --> 00:07:01,155
and most importantly,
it's winged.

72
00:07:01,188 --> 00:07:02,422
A thin body.

73
00:07:03,024 --> 00:07:04,992
Either hooves or claws,

74
00:07:05,026 --> 00:07:08,362
depending on the version
of the story
that you're hearing.

75
00:07:08,396 --> 00:07:10,031
<i>So the wings</i>
<i>have carried through.</i>

76
00:07:10,064 --> 00:07:13,701
<i>But this...</i>
<i>Does it have horse feet?</i>

77
00:07:13,734 --> 00:07:16,304
<i>Does it have hooves</i>
<i>or the cloven hooves?</i>

78
00:07:16,337 --> 00:07:20,641
That all seems to go away,
and it's more of
a giant winged cryptid.

79
00:07:20,675 --> 00:07:26,414
Imagine Pegasus at the wrong end
of a really bad meth addiction.

80
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:29,016
<i>That's what the Jersey Devils</i>
<i>looks like.</i>

81
00:07:32,253 --> 00:07:33,788
Descriptions of
the Jersey Devil,

82
00:07:33,821 --> 00:07:35,656
match with the popular concept

83
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:40,428
of what the devil
would look like
if you were to encounter him.

84
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:44,732
Even though the <i>Bible</i> gives
a slightly different answer
to that question.

85
00:08:15,463 --> 00:08:17,064
<i>Now, look,</i>
<i>all I'm saying is these</i>

86
00:08:17,098 --> 00:08:18,933
<i>weird sightings taking place</i>
<i>in the Barrens</i>

87
00:08:18,966 --> 00:08:23,270
<i>could really just be</i>
<i>some pineys</i>
<i>with overactive imaginations.</i>

88
00:08:23,304 --> 00:08:24,872
<i>We're talking about people</i>
<i>claiming the kids</i>

89
00:08:24,905 --> 00:08:27,942
<i>are performing</i>
<i>rituals in the woods now.</i>

90
00:08:27,975 --> 00:08:29,410
<i>And they're raising the devil.</i>

91
00:08:29,443 --> 00:08:32,713
<i>Really? This is where</i>
<i>we're at, really?</i>

92
00:08:32,747 --> 00:08:36,017
<i>Supposedly, this demon</i>
<i>is some sort of flying horse</i>
<i>with wings,</i>

93
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:37,818
<i>and they're finding</i>
<i>tracks in the snow,</i>

94
00:08:37,852 --> 00:08:39,253
<i>tracks in the sand.</i>

95
00:08:39,286 --> 00:08:43,124
<i>And park rangers are running</i>
<i>into this thing and on and on.</i>

96
00:08:43,657 --> 00:08:45,292
<i>Pineys, man.</i>

97
00:08:45,326 --> 00:08:48,629
<i>We are in the middle</i>
<i>of this hysteria</i>
<i>over people performing rituals</i>

98
00:08:48,662 --> 00:08:52,366
<i>by playing Dungeons & Dragons</i>
<i>or listening to hair metal.</i>

99
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,036
<i>Well, listen,</i>
<i>if this thing is a demon</i>

100
00:08:55,069 --> 00:08:58,406
<i>summoned by hair metal,</i>
<i>sign me up for a look at it.</i>

101
00:09:10,384 --> 00:09:11,318
Ranger station.

102
00:09:12,553 --> 00:09:13,587
Hello, Miss Stockwell.

103
00:09:16,357 --> 00:09:18,592
Yes, we we do have a curfew
in effect.

104
00:09:20,828 --> 00:09:23,297
Dusk till dawn. Yeah.

105
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:26,233
No. No, it's always been
that way.

106
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:29,538
It's no acknowledgment
of a monster. No.

107
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:30,604
Those are all rumors.

108
00:09:30,638 --> 00:09:31,572
Every single one of them.

109
00:09:34,742 --> 00:09:36,677
Heavy metal freaks?

110
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:39,980
No, they're just good kids
having fun
on their bikes.

111
00:09:40,014 --> 00:09:43,584
That's it. They're all in
the baseball team.

112
00:09:43,617 --> 00:09:45,286
They don't hurt anything.

113
00:09:45,319 --> 00:09:47,655
They clean up after themselves.

114
00:09:47,688 --> 00:09:52,159
No. We've never found
any evidence of any
satanic rituals on the property.

115
00:09:52,193 --> 00:09:53,127
No.

116
00:09:55,229 --> 00:09:58,099
No, no, I can't arrest them. No.

117
00:09:59,867 --> 00:10:02,203
All right. Thank you. Bye.

118
00:10:09,343 --> 00:10:10,277
God bless!

119
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:29,497
Just say you're chicken.

120
00:10:30,631 --> 00:10:32,299
You do not have botulism.

121
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:36,437
Whatever, Jake.
I'm going to land
murder hill tonight.

122
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:37,271
I need a witness.

123
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:38,607
Nobody's going to believe me.

124
00:10:41,142 --> 00:10:42,743
You suck, Jake. You suck.

125
00:10:43,545 --> 00:10:44,478
I'll do it on my own.

126
00:10:55,923 --> 00:10:59,594
Hey, Mom.
Yeah, I'm going with Jake.

127
00:11:00,728 --> 00:11:02,429
I know. I'll be home by 9:00.

128
00:11:02,463 --> 00:11:03,397
No excuses.

129
00:11:04,965 --> 00:11:06,100
Love you, too.

130
00:12:15,836 --> 00:12:16,770
Hey!

131
00:13:43,991 --> 00:13:46,293
All right. Stockwell, you win.

132
00:13:50,765 --> 00:13:54,569
A master's degree in
wildlife resource management,

133
00:13:54,602 --> 00:13:56,538
and I am nothing

134
00:13:57,838 --> 00:14:01,543
but a glorified forest janitor.

135
00:14:01,576 --> 00:14:04,411
<i>Come in, Dean,</i>
<i>you out there buddy?</i>

136
00:14:04,945 --> 00:14:05,879
<i>It's Tom.</i>

137
00:14:09,183 --> 00:14:10,851
Copy. Hey, Tom, what's up?

138
00:14:10,884 --> 00:14:14,388
<i>Yeah, we got</i>
<i>a report of a missing kid</i>
<i>on a bike.</i>

139
00:14:24,365 --> 00:14:27,000
Copy that. Yeah, sorry.

140
00:14:27,034 --> 00:14:28,670
I'll... I'll go check it out.

141
00:14:43,951 --> 00:14:47,187
No! Get away!

142
00:14:52,192 --> 00:14:53,327
Tom?

143
00:14:54,094 --> 00:14:55,429
Tom? Yeah.

144
00:14:55,929 --> 00:14:57,599
I found the bike.

145
00:14:57,632 --> 00:15:00,300
I think... I think it might be
your missing kid.

146
00:15:00,901 --> 00:15:02,837
Send help! Send help!

147
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:24,893
Hey. Hey. Hey.

148
00:15:24,925 --> 00:15:27,629
Just stay low, follow me, okay?
Come on. Come on. Come on.

149
00:15:30,865 --> 00:15:33,500
<i>Dean, you there? Dean?</i>

150
00:15:53,655 --> 00:15:56,190
What the hell
was that thing, kid?
What'd you get us into?

151
00:15:57,926 --> 00:16:01,629
Okay, I'm gonna call...
I'm gonna call for backup.

152
00:16:04,264 --> 00:16:05,466
I dropped my radio.

153
00:16:07,669 --> 00:16:10,404
-What's your name?
-It's...

154
00:16:11,773 --> 00:16:12,807
It's Paul.

155
00:16:12,841 --> 00:16:14,374
Okay, Paul, listen.

156
00:16:14,408 --> 00:16:18,680
I was in contact with the police
right before I found you.

157
00:16:18,713 --> 00:16:21,181
There are other people out here
looking for us, okay?

158
00:16:21,215 --> 00:16:22,416
They're gonna be here soon.

159
00:16:23,918 --> 00:16:27,622
We just need to hunker down,
and we're gonna be okay.

160
00:16:28,288 --> 00:16:29,423
All right?

161
00:16:30,123 --> 00:16:31,391
Okay? We're going to be fine.

162
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,094
Just relax.

163
00:17:03,056 --> 00:17:05,158
We're dead. We're dead.

164
00:17:05,192 --> 00:17:07,327
We're gonna have to make a run
for my station, okay?

165
00:17:07,361 --> 00:17:08,997
- Okay.
- Okay?

166
00:17:09,029 --> 00:17:11,398
Run hard. Do not look back.

167
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,066
Do not look back.

168
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,101
All right. Let's move.

169
00:17:17,539 --> 00:17:19,007
Come here!
Get back. Move.

170
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,508
Head down. Go! Go! Go!

171
00:17:49,704 --> 00:17:51,371
Do it! Do it now!

172
00:17:52,472 --> 00:17:53,541
Get down!

173
00:18:09,591 --> 00:18:15,262
Well, in about 1982 is when
National Hockey League team

174
00:18:15,295 --> 00:18:21,736
had moved to the New Jersey area
and was seeking names
for the club.

175
00:18:21,769 --> 00:18:24,471
<i>The franchise</i>
<i>had a contest, actually.</i>

176
00:18:24,505 --> 00:18:27,240
<i>Over 10,000 fans</i>
<i>evidently wrote in</i>

177
00:18:27,274 --> 00:18:29,209
<i>to give their suggestions.</i>

178
00:18:29,242 --> 00:18:30,812
<i>And one of them...</i>

179
00:18:30,845 --> 00:18:33,615
<i>The one that won</i>
<i>was New Jersey Devils.</i>

180
00:18:33,648 --> 00:18:36,283
<i>And that was</i>
<i>a deliberate callback</i>

181
00:18:36,316 --> 00:18:39,687
<i>to the Jersey Devil legend.</i>

182
00:18:39,721 --> 00:18:41,121
<i>So that, as far as I know,</i>

183
00:18:41,154 --> 00:18:44,324
<i>it's the only major league team</i>
<i>in any sport</i>

184
00:18:44,358 --> 00:18:47,194
<i>that features a cryptid</i>
<i>as its mascot.</i>

185
00:18:47,227 --> 00:18:51,866
<i>It really is a reference</i>
<i>to the Leeds' story.</i>

186
00:18:51,899 --> 00:18:54,401
Yeah, I think you'd be saying,
like the early 80s was

187
00:18:54,434 --> 00:18:56,269
when it kicked in from the...

188
00:18:58,606 --> 00:19:00,407
<i>The Satanic panic.</i>

189
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:04,311
<i>Fascinating period</i>
<i>in our history</i>
<i>that was really kicked off</i>

190
00:19:04,344 --> 00:19:05,580
<i>in the 1980s,</i>

191
00:19:05,613 --> 00:19:08,750
<i>where good,</i>
<i>God-fearing Americans</i>

192
00:19:08,783 --> 00:19:12,553
<i>began to go</i>
<i>almost on witch hunts</i>

193
00:19:12,587 --> 00:19:15,556
to strike out and find
those in their own community,

194
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:19,027
who were practicing
anything related to Satan.

195
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:24,264
This included any type
of occultist beliefs in,

196
00:19:24,297 --> 00:19:31,572
you know, witches
or spirituality or crystals,
sageing, incense.

197
00:19:31,606 --> 00:19:36,110
In fact, I've seen people
discuss the likelihood

198
00:19:36,144 --> 00:19:39,847
<i>that trips into the</i>
<i>Pine Barrens will result</i>
<i>in finding places</i>

199
00:19:39,881 --> 00:19:42,617
<i>where satanic sacrifices</i>
<i>have occurred,</i>

200
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:45,620
<i>or where occultists are doing</i>
<i>all sorts of sacrifices</i>

201
00:19:45,653 --> 00:19:49,991
<i>and that's used as reasoning</i>
<i>for why people should not enter</i>
<i>the Pine Barrens,</i>

202
00:19:50,024 --> 00:19:52,960
<i>is because it's this place</i>
<i>for satanic practice.</i>

203
00:19:55,295 --> 00:19:59,499
A possible link between the 80s,
the Satanic panic,

204
00:19:59,534 --> 00:20:02,670
and then the Jersey Devil
or Leeds Devil,

205
00:20:02,704 --> 00:20:06,941
<i>I would get backlash</i>
<i>when I would tell people</i>

206
00:20:06,974 --> 00:20:08,943
<i>I'm going to go look</i>
<i>for the Jersey Devil.</i>

207
00:20:08,976 --> 00:20:12,279
<i>And it was,</i>
<i>"What are you looking</i>
<i>for the devil for?"</i>

208
00:20:12,312 --> 00:20:15,950
But there certainly was,
for me, the backlash being like,

209
00:20:15,983 --> 00:20:17,919
"What, are you playing
your records backwards, too?"

210
00:20:17,952 --> 00:20:19,419
And doing
all that sort of stuff.

211
00:20:19,453 --> 00:20:23,057
This is heightened when we think
of the role of the Jersey Devil

212
00:20:23,091 --> 00:20:26,226
<i>and the stories</i>
<i>of the Jersey Devil's</i>
<i>origin as, you know,</i>

213
00:20:26,259 --> 00:20:29,597
<i>either son of Satan</i>
<i>or in bonds with Satan</i>

214
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:32,265
<i>or offspring of Satan,</i>
<i>whatever it might be,</i>

215
00:20:32,299 --> 00:20:33,968
<i>that sightings of this creature</i>

216
00:20:34,001 --> 00:20:38,539
<i>known as the Jersey Devil</i>
<i>are reaching this new height,</i>

217
00:20:38,573 --> 00:20:41,109
<i>this new purported wave.</i>

218
00:20:41,142 --> 00:20:42,409
<i>Because it ties into</i>

219
00:20:42,442 --> 00:20:45,613
<i>that overarching fear</i>
<i>that's gripping our nation.</i>

220
00:20:47,682 --> 00:20:51,318
I remember there was some kind
of a wave of sightings
in the 80s.

221
00:20:51,351 --> 00:20:53,921
And isn't that the one
where the police put up signs

222
00:20:53,955 --> 00:20:56,724
<i>saying the Jersey devil</i>
<i>is a hoax?</i>

223
00:20:56,758 --> 00:21:02,530
<i>The sightings, it seems</i>
<i>to come in like little waves,</i>
<i>and it's sporadic.</i>

224
00:21:02,563 --> 00:21:04,132
<i>I don't know how</i>
<i>to account for that.</i>

225
00:21:04,165 --> 00:21:06,366
<i>I think, obviously,</i>
<i>if somebody claims</i>

226
00:21:06,399 --> 00:21:10,738
<i>that they saw the</i>
<i>Jersey Devil, it could</i>
<i>trigger copycat claims.</i>

227
00:21:10,772 --> 00:21:13,107
<i>There are</i>
<i>a lot of newspaper reports</i>

228
00:21:13,141 --> 00:21:17,879
<i>into the 80s,</i>
<i>and several of them</i>
<i>make reference to the Pineys,</i>

229
00:21:17,912 --> 00:21:22,250
<i>the people who lived out there,</i>
<i>saying that the Leeds Devil</i>

230
00:21:22,282 --> 00:21:23,918
<i>was sort of like the boogeyman,</i>

231
00:21:23,951 --> 00:21:25,887
<i>that don't go out at night</i>
<i>or stay home or...</i>

232
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:30,124
<i>There are some reports where</i>
<i>they're actually saying</i>
it was almost like

233
00:21:30,158 --> 00:21:32,126
<i>the Leeds Devil</i>
<i>was like Santa Claus,</i>

234
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,828
<i>that they knew</i>
<i>what you were doing.</i>

235
00:21:33,861 --> 00:21:37,297
<i>And if you did anything bad,</i>
<i>the devil was coming for you.</i>

236
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:39,267
<i>Which, again, I think</i>
<i>is sort of interesting</i>

237
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:43,070
<i>when you look at and just say,</i>
<i>take the Leeds part out of that</i>

238
00:21:43,104 --> 00:21:46,574
<i>and, hey, you do anything bad,</i>
<i>'the' devil is coming for you.</i>

239
00:21:46,607 --> 00:21:50,678
<i>I could see how some of that</i>
<i>got transposed with each other.</i>

240
00:21:53,047 --> 00:21:57,384
Typically, the sighting
is of a winged creature,

241
00:21:57,417 --> 00:22:00,387
you know, either from the ground
taking off and flying,

242
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:03,758
<i>or being seen flying</i>
<i>through the woods themselves.</i>

243
00:22:03,791 --> 00:22:05,358
<i>According to</i>
<i>the Asbury Park Press</i>

244
00:22:05,392 --> 00:22:09,496
<i>of October 1988,</i>
<i>a man who lived</i>
<i>in Howell Township</i>

245
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:11,999
<i>encountered the devil in 1981.</i>

246
00:22:12,033 --> 00:22:13,634
<i>He described the creature</i>

247
00:22:13,668 --> 00:22:16,904
<i>as having a furry body,</i>
<i>huge feet with three toes</i>
<i>on each one,</i>

248
00:22:16,938 --> 00:22:20,407
<i>large teeth and he stood</i>
<i>about six feet tall.</i>

249
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:24,212
I know a hunter,
a friend of mine who's a hunter
said he got up early

250
00:22:24,245 --> 00:22:28,448
one morning to go deer hunting,
and he got in his stand

251
00:22:28,481 --> 00:22:31,484
<i>and he kept hearing</i>
<i>some really strange,</i>
<i>loud noises.</i>

252
00:22:31,519 --> 00:22:36,824
<i>And then in the opening</i>
<i>in the woods that was adjacent</i>
<i>to his hunting stand,</i>

253
00:22:36,858 --> 00:22:42,429
<i>he saw a strange creature,</i>
<i>that was moving along</i>
<i>in the early morning.</i>

254
00:22:42,462 --> 00:22:45,766
<i>Just barely light, you know?</i>
<i>It was making such</i>
<i>a loud noises</i>

255
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:48,435
<i>- and he couldn't account</i>
<i>for what kind of animal it was.</i>

256
00:22:48,468 --> 00:22:51,772
<i>And he said he got out of</i>
<i>the stand and went back</i>
<i>to his truck and went home.</i>

257
00:22:51,806 --> 00:22:54,675
<i>There were... I would say</i>
<i>there's a steady stream</i>
<i>of sightings.</i>

258
00:22:54,709 --> 00:23:00,147
Yeah, I mean, in the 1980s,
there are some
very 80s-style sightings.

259
00:23:00,181 --> 00:23:01,749
I mean, there was one
in which there were

260
00:23:01,782 --> 00:23:05,653
a group of dirt bikers
who were riding around
in the Pine Barrens.

261
00:23:05,686 --> 00:23:07,321
"In the late 1980s,

262
00:23:07,355 --> 00:23:10,191
a couple of my friends and I
took a camping trip
to the Pine Barrens.

263
00:23:10,224 --> 00:23:13,661
I was unaware
that we were headed to the home
of the Jersey devil.

264
00:23:13,694 --> 00:23:17,298
We headed out on our bikes
and did our fair share
of partying that night.

265
00:23:17,331 --> 00:23:19,200
<i>The next day,</i>
<i>while everyone was asleep,</i>

266
00:23:19,233 --> 00:23:23,004
<i>three of us decided</i>
<i>to hit the trails</i>
<i>a bit earlier than usual.</i>

267
00:23:23,037 --> 00:23:25,506
<i>We were about 100 yards away</i>
<i>in the woods</i>

268
00:23:25,539 --> 00:23:27,141
<i>when my bike stalled out.</i>

269
00:23:27,174 --> 00:23:29,744
<i>I looked and found</i>
<i>that my friends</i>
<i>had stalled also.</i>

270
00:23:29,777 --> 00:23:32,513
<i>At first, I thought it had</i>
<i>something to do</i>
<i>with the terrain</i>

271
00:23:32,546 --> 00:23:36,117
<i>or maybe something to do</i>
<i>with the nearby power plants.</i>

272
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:37,518
<i>Fifty feet away</i>
<i>from each other,</i>

273
00:23:37,551 --> 00:23:40,453
<i>we tried to start up our bikes</i>
<i>when suddenly, from the woods,</i>

274
00:23:40,487 --> 00:23:42,957
<i>we heard the most horrible,</i>
<i>piercing scream.</i>

275
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:44,959
<i>It sounded inhuman.</i>

276
00:23:44,992 --> 00:23:46,861
<i>Like something being tortured.</i>

277
00:23:46,894 --> 00:23:51,032
<i>Once back at camp,</i>
<i>they asked us if we had</i>
<i>heard screams earlier.</i>

278
00:23:51,065 --> 00:23:54,368
<i>They had heard them, too,</i>
<i>about four miles away.</i>

279
00:23:54,402 --> 00:23:58,005
<i>That night, we headed</i>
<i>into the local town</i>
<i>because we ran out of booze.</i>

280
00:23:58,039 --> 00:24:01,008
<i>We went into a bar</i>
<i>and I ordered a drink</i>
<i>still in shock</i>

281
00:24:01,042 --> 00:24:04,111
<i>from what I heard that morning.</i>
<i>The bartender asked,</i>

282
00:24:04,145 --> 00:24:06,881
<i>'Hey, kid, what'd you see</i>
<i>a ghost or something?'</i>

283
00:24:06,914 --> 00:24:09,684
<i>After I told him the story,</i>
<i>he smiled and said,</i>

284
00:24:09,717 --> 00:24:11,719
<i>'Looks like you met</i>
<i>our little friend.'</i>

285
00:24:11,752 --> 00:24:13,287
He then asked us
to come out back.

286
00:24:13,321 --> 00:24:16,357
He showed us a tin garbage can
that was shredded to bits.

287
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:19,827
It looked like
the shreds were made
from something with three claws.

288
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:23,364
I've never returned
to the Pine Barrens since,
and I don't plan to go back."

289
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:31,772
But also in the 1980s,
there was very strange thing
that was reported.

290
00:24:31,806 --> 00:24:34,474
I think that was 1980,
to be precise,

291
00:24:34,508 --> 00:24:39,280
where there was some sort of
State game warden
or someone,

292
00:24:39,313 --> 00:24:45,353
park ranger, perhaps,
that found, had a farm,
a group of pigs

293
00:24:45,386 --> 00:24:48,889
<i>that had been eaten</i>
<i>like from the top</i>
<i>of their heads</i>

294
00:24:48,923 --> 00:24:51,359
<i>had been gnawed off,</i>
<i>but there were no tracks</i>

295
00:24:51,392 --> 00:24:55,863
<i>around any of the poor animals</i>
<i>that had met that end.</i>

296
00:24:55,896 --> 00:25:00,868
<i>So the question... Even though</i>
<i>there's no eyewitness report</i>
<i>of a creature</i>

297
00:25:00,901 --> 00:25:03,671
<i>that was still</i>
<i>raising questions about</i>

298
00:25:03,704 --> 00:25:06,574
<i>that particular part</i>
<i>of the State.</i>

299
00:25:06,607 --> 00:25:10,244
<i>There were once</i>
<i>State parks kind of came in</i>
<i>to play.</i>

300
00:25:10,277 --> 00:25:15,516
<i>In general, you get a lot of</i>
<i>these generalizations about</i>

301
00:25:15,549 --> 00:25:17,385
<i>park ranger saw this or...</i>

302
00:25:17,418 --> 00:25:21,022
<i>Not just with the Leeds Devil,</i>
<i>but in general.</i>

303
00:25:21,055 --> 00:25:24,125
<i>I think some people</i>
<i>will pull that in because</i>

304
00:25:24,158 --> 00:25:26,494
<i>you now have</i>
<i>a credible witness.</i>

305
00:25:26,527 --> 00:25:29,363
<i>You have a park ranger</i>
<i>that's going out there</i>

306
00:25:29,397 --> 00:25:31,665
<i>and they would know the areas</i>
<i>so they would know</i>
<i>what's going on.</i>

307
00:25:31,699 --> 00:25:35,169
<i>So, I think</i>
<i>some of the urban legends,</i>
<i>if you will,</i>

308
00:25:35,202 --> 00:25:37,972
<i>pull in park rangers</i>
<i>in general. That being said,</i>

309
00:25:38,005 --> 00:25:43,611
<i>it would stand to reason</i>
<i>that people</i>
<i>who have the most chance</i>

310
00:25:43,644 --> 00:25:48,082
of encountering the Leeds Devil
or the Jersey Devil
would be park rangers

311
00:25:48,115 --> 00:25:51,419
or people that lived out there
because they spend the most time
out there, so.

312
00:25:51,452 --> 00:25:54,523
By the 1980s, I think
there was a general sense

313
00:25:54,555 --> 00:25:59,460
that there was a cryptid afoot
in the Pine Barrens.

314
00:25:59,493 --> 00:26:03,431
<i>I think the</i>
<i>public consciousness</i>
<i>at that point was</i>

315
00:26:03,464 --> 00:26:06,500
<i>already had taken</i>
<i>pretty good form.</i>

316
00:26:06,535 --> 00:26:09,170
<i>And there would be things</i>
<i>that would come</i>
<i>a little bit later</i>

317
00:26:10,539 --> 00:26:13,140
<i>like</i> Blair Witch Project,
<i>for example,</i>

318
00:26:13,174 --> 00:26:16,477
<i>that drew even more attention</i>
<i>to that region of the country.</i>

319
00:34:49,991 --> 00:34:56,263
So, in 1909,
it is the turn of the century.

320
00:34:56,296 --> 00:34:57,431
Right? A lot is happening.

321
00:34:57,464 --> 00:34:58,800
We're ramping up to World War I,

322
00:34:58,833 --> 00:35:00,568
there is a lot of social change,

323
00:35:00,602 --> 00:35:02,537
<i>there's a lot</i>
<i>of economic change,</i>

324
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:04,806
<i>and there's a ton</i>
<i>of industrial change.</i>

325
00:35:04,839 --> 00:35:07,842
<i>All of that is kind of</i>
<i>circulating the air.</i>

326
00:35:07,875 --> 00:35:12,814
<i>Interestingly, in January</i>
<i>that year between</i>
<i>16th and 23rd,</i>

327
00:35:12,847 --> 00:35:16,316
<i>we see a rash</i>
<i>of newspaper publications</i>

328
00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:21,288
that indicate an intense series
of sightings
of the Jersey Devil.

329
00:35:21,321 --> 00:35:27,028
Some reporters go poking around,
and they speak to some people

330
00:35:27,061 --> 00:35:29,329
living there,
especially the Pine Barrens.

331
00:35:29,363 --> 00:35:34,902
And a few older people say,
"Well, you know,
when I was a little kid,

332
00:35:34,936 --> 00:35:37,204
my grandpa talked
about the Leeds Devil.

333
00:35:37,237 --> 00:35:40,842
Maybe it's the Leeds Devil
who is doing...
leaving these footprints

334
00:35:40,875 --> 00:35:44,144
and, you know, stealing stuff
out of people's barns

335
00:35:44,177 --> 00:35:47,649
<i>and chasing away their goats</i>
<i>and whatever."</i>

336
00:35:47,682 --> 00:35:51,819
<i>And so slowly</i>
<i>that idea starts to build.</i>

337
00:35:51,853 --> 00:35:57,190
Well, I think
the hardest story to explain
is the story

338
00:35:57,224 --> 00:36:02,530
of the multiple sightings
of the Jersey Devil
in January, 1909,

339
00:36:02,563 --> 00:36:05,533
<i>There were policemen</i>
<i>who fired their pistols</i>
<i>at the thing.</i>

340
00:36:05,566 --> 00:36:07,001
<i>There were, you know,</i>

341
00:36:07,035 --> 00:36:11,238
<i>people who reported</i>
<i>face to face encounters</i>
<i>with it.</i>

342
00:36:11,271 --> 00:36:12,372
<i>People really were terrified.</i>

343
00:36:12,406 --> 00:36:14,842
<i>The newspapers</i>
<i>picked up the stories.</i>

344
00:36:14,876 --> 00:36:19,647
Well, in the 1909,
sighting flap of
the Jersey devil,

345
00:36:19,681 --> 00:36:22,083
I think what characterized
that more than anything else

346
00:36:22,116 --> 00:36:26,420
was the tracks that were found
all throughout the Pine Barrens

347
00:36:26,453 --> 00:36:28,990
<i>and the surrounding towns.</i>

348
00:36:29,023 --> 00:36:32,860
<i>So,</i>
<i>on the 16th of January,</i>
<i>which was a Saturday,</i>

349
00:36:32,894 --> 00:36:37,565
<i>the creature was seen flying</i>
<i>over Woodbury, New Jersey.</i>

350
00:36:37,598 --> 00:36:40,500
<i>On the 17th</i>
<i>in Bristol, Pennsylvania,</i>

351
00:36:40,535 --> 00:36:45,472
<i>this is where several people</i>
<i>saw the creature in the tracks</i>
<i>that it created.</i>

352
00:36:45,506 --> 00:36:48,442
<i>On Monday the 18th,</i>
<i>the town of Burlington</i>

353
00:36:48,475 --> 00:36:52,180
<i>was covered in strange tracks,</i>
<i>which seemed to defy logic.</i>

354
00:36:52,212 --> 00:36:55,449
<i>And then some of these</i>
<i>same tracks were found</i>
<i>in other towns.</i>

355
00:36:55,482 --> 00:36:59,687
<i>Long track lines</i>
<i>that look like hoof prints</i>
<i>in the snow.</i>

356
00:36:59,721 --> 00:37:04,257
<i>Those were seen all throughout</i>
<i>the area, even going up</i>
<i>onto people's roofs</i>

357
00:37:04,291 --> 00:37:08,062
<i>and ascending and descending</i>
<i>and appearing and disappearing,</i>

358
00:37:08,096 --> 00:37:12,033
<i>and that was sort of</i>
<i>the main feature</i>
<i>of all of those.</i>

359
00:37:12,066 --> 00:37:13,300
<i>Two Gloucester hunters</i>

360
00:37:13,333 --> 00:37:15,837
<i>also tracked the</i>
<i>creature's perplexing trail</i>

361
00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:17,572
<i>for about 20 or so miles.</i>

362
00:37:17,605 --> 00:37:19,173
<i>The trail, interestingly,</i>

363
00:37:19,207 --> 00:37:23,243
appeared to jump fences
and squeeze under
eight-inch gaps.

364
00:37:23,276 --> 00:37:29,650
So, not only did it have
an insane vertical leap but also
could shrink extremely small.

365
00:37:29,684 --> 00:37:34,589
Newspapers even produced maps
showing all of the
different locations

366
00:37:34,622 --> 00:37:37,992
where people had claimed
to have seen this thing.

367
00:37:38,025 --> 00:37:39,961
<i>They followed tracks</i>
<i>in the snow</i>

368
00:37:39,994 --> 00:37:43,598
<i>to see if they could</i>
<i>track the thing down</i>
<i>and kill it, you know.</i>

369
00:37:43,631 --> 00:37:47,201
<i>Formed posses and they tried</i>
<i>to track it down.</i>

370
00:37:47,235 --> 00:37:50,337
<i>What kind of tracks</i>
<i>they were actually following?</i>
<i>I don't know.</i>

371
00:37:54,108 --> 00:37:56,376
When you look
at the published reports,

372
00:37:56,409 --> 00:38:00,313
that's when you start to think
these are a little weird.

373
00:38:00,347 --> 00:38:06,120
Because the Leeds Devil
was accused of everything
from attacking livestock

374
00:38:06,154 --> 00:38:07,354
to attacking people.

375
00:38:07,387 --> 00:38:09,223
In some versions,

376
00:38:09,257 --> 00:38:12,593
people said that it was more
like a dragon and it was
breathing fire and that it was

377
00:38:12,627 --> 00:38:15,328
setting like rail road tracks
on fire.

378
00:38:15,362 --> 00:38:18,766
The one
that I've always been
fascinated with

379
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,102
and could never find anything,
except it was printed in

380
00:38:21,135 --> 00:38:24,437
two newspaper reports,
is that police officer

381
00:38:24,471 --> 00:38:27,508
<i>was making the rounds,</i>
<i>and he thought, he described it</i>

382
00:38:27,542 --> 00:38:31,279
<i>as a giant closed umbrella</i>

383
00:38:31,311 --> 00:38:35,049
<i>leaning against a fence post,</i>
<i>and he went over</i>

384
00:38:35,082 --> 00:38:37,585
<i>to sort of pull it down</i>
<i>or what have you,</i>

385
00:38:37,618 --> 00:38:40,121
<i>and it opened up</i>
<i>and spread its wings.</i>

386
00:38:40,154 --> 00:38:44,391
<i>And he started wrestling</i>
<i>with this thing,</i>
<i>supposedly.</i>

387
00:38:44,424 --> 00:38:46,227
<i>And then it just took off.</i>

388
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:48,930
<i>And I think</i>
<i>that's one of</i>
<i>the closest encounters,</i>

389
00:38:48,963 --> 00:38:52,200
<i>if that really was</i>
<i>the Leeds Devil,</i>
<i>that I've found so far.</i>

390
00:38:52,233 --> 00:38:54,434
<i>So I've always been</i>
<i>fascinated with that one.</i>

391
00:38:54,467 --> 00:38:57,572
<i>And many towns</i>
<i>at this point</i>
<i>were panic stricken.</i>

392
00:38:57,605 --> 00:38:59,707
<i>News had broken out</i>
<i>all across the area,</i>

393
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:02,409
<i>and they knew</i>
<i>that stuff was crazy.</i>

394
00:39:02,442 --> 00:39:05,880
<i>Many businesses were closed</i>
<i>and schools were also closed</i>

395
00:39:05,913 --> 00:39:09,217
<i>or they were forced to close</i>
<i>due to lack of attendance.</i>

396
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:13,254
<i>They were</i>
<i>still seeing it in</i>
<i>the Pine Barrens area.</i>

397
00:39:13,287 --> 00:39:15,823
<i>But it pushed up into New York</i>
<i>and then specifically,</i>

398
00:39:15,857 --> 00:39:17,625
<i>it made its way</i>
<i>into Philadelphia.</i>

399
00:39:17,658 --> 00:39:22,395
<i>So we're not talking any more</i>
<i>about these</i>
<i>sort of isolated reports of,</i>

400
00:39:22,429 --> 00:39:24,765
<i>you know, the pineys</i>
<i>that are seeing</i>
<i>something weird.</i>

401
00:39:24,799 --> 00:39:26,100
<i>You're getting into</i>
<i>like Philadelphia.</i>

402
00:39:26,133 --> 00:39:29,904
<i>So you're talking about</i>
<i>densely populated areas</i>

403
00:39:29,937 --> 00:39:31,739
<i>that the creature</i>
<i>was roaming around.</i>

404
00:39:31,772 --> 00:39:36,210
<i>And that, again,</i>
<i>is what's so fascinating</i>
<i>about the 1909 sightings.</i>

405
00:39:36,244 --> 00:39:38,445
<i>The creature</i>
<i>apparently was not fazed</i>

406
00:39:38,478 --> 00:39:40,147
<i>as it continued to rampage</i>

407
00:39:40,181 --> 00:39:43,718
<i>through Philadelphia,</i>
<i>Pennsylvania and</i>
<i>West Collingswood, New Jersey,</i>

408
00:39:43,751 --> 00:39:47,989
<i>where it was supposedly hosed</i>
<i>by the local fire department.</i>

409
00:39:48,022 --> 00:39:50,524
<i>The devil seemed poised</i>
<i>to attack nearby people</i>

410
00:39:50,558 --> 00:39:54,061
<i>who defensively threw</i>
<i>any available objects at it.</i>

411
00:39:54,095 --> 00:39:56,230
The creature would suddenly
fly away,

412
00:39:56,264 --> 00:39:59,901
<i>and it would reemerge later</i>
<i>only to injure a dog,</i>

413
00:39:59,934 --> 00:40:04,839
<i>ripping a chunk of flesh</i>
<i>from its cheek</i>
<i>before the owner drove it away.</i>

414
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:09,442
<i>The idea of it</i>
<i>being seen, any cryptid,</i>

415
00:40:09,476 --> 00:40:14,682
<i>being seen</i>
<i>in a densely populated</i>
<i>major city is,</i>

416
00:40:14,715 --> 00:40:16,284
it's unheard of.

417
00:40:16,317 --> 00:40:19,687
You know, it's very unique
because most of
any cryptid sightings

418
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:22,189
and the vast majority
of the Leeds Devil story,

419
00:40:22,223 --> 00:40:26,627
then Jersey Devil stories
are in remote areas

420
00:40:26,661 --> 00:40:28,663
that you've got one
or two witnesses,

421
00:40:28,696 --> 00:40:30,798
or if it's over
a series of days.

422
00:40:30,831 --> 00:40:33,267
Maybe you've got
a handful of witnesses.

423
00:40:33,301 --> 00:40:36,637
<i>We're talking hundreds</i>
<i>of witnesses</i>
<i>allegedly taking place</i>

424
00:40:36,671 --> 00:40:38,339
<i>in a major city.</i>

425
00:40:41,342 --> 00:40:44,979
At this time, the primary way
that people would receive news

426
00:40:45,012 --> 00:40:47,181
was from the morning
and evening paper

427
00:40:47,214 --> 00:40:49,984
that would be published
by local printing presses

428
00:40:50,017 --> 00:40:52,420
as well as
a few regional papers.

429
00:40:52,452 --> 00:40:54,889
And many communities
would have several newspapers,

430
00:40:54,922 --> 00:40:58,726
so people were always vying
for the best report,
the best headlines

431
00:40:58,759 --> 00:41:02,163
because they wanted their papers
to sell above everybody else's.

432
00:41:02,196 --> 00:41:05,633
And, if you had
the most popular newspaper,

433
00:41:05,666 --> 00:41:07,969
you were afforded a very special

434
00:41:08,002 --> 00:41:11,038
and particular type of esteem
in your community.

435
00:41:11,072 --> 00:41:14,809
I have heard before
that there is thought that

436
00:41:14,842 --> 00:41:17,778
this story or series of stories

437
00:41:17,812 --> 00:41:20,614
was concocted in order
to sell newspapers

438
00:41:20,648 --> 00:41:23,918
because this area
saw the opportunity

439
00:41:23,951 --> 00:41:28,155
and as one paper started to do
really well, the next paper
would make up another story

440
00:41:28,189 --> 00:41:31,125
and it would only grow and grow
and grow and grow and grow.

441
00:41:31,158 --> 00:41:34,628
It's really been alleged
that a lot
of the 1909 sightings,

442
00:41:34,662 --> 00:41:36,263
the track finds were one thing,

443
00:41:36,297 --> 00:41:41,068
but the sightings
may have been planted
in the media

444
00:41:41,102 --> 00:41:44,205
by those who were looking
to sell tickets

445
00:41:44,238 --> 00:41:47,108
to their Dime Museum
in Philadelphia.

446
00:41:51,345 --> 00:41:52,913
<i>There is a place</i>
<i>in Philadelphia</i>

447
00:41:52,947 --> 00:41:54,882
<i>which, unfortunately,</i>
<i>is no longer there,</i>

448
00:41:54,915 --> 00:41:58,519
<i>called the 9th & Arch Street</i>
<i>Dime Museum.</i>

449
00:41:58,552 --> 00:42:02,690
<i>It's a parking lot now,</i>
<i>in downtown, Philadelphia.</i>

450
00:42:02,723 --> 00:42:05,926
<i>And Dime Museums</i>
<i>were really popular</i>

451
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:08,362
<i>in the late 19th,</i>
<i>early 20th centuries.</i>

452
00:42:08,396 --> 00:42:12,666
<i>They were basically</i>
<i>circus side shows</i>

453
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:16,505
<i>and you know you'd have</i>
<i>the two-headed babies in a jar,</i>

454
00:42:16,537 --> 00:42:20,941
<i>you'd have the skinny man</i>
<i>and the fat lady,</i>

455
00:42:20,975 --> 00:42:23,077
<i>and you'd have jugglers</i>
<i>and all that.</i>

456
00:42:23,110 --> 00:42:28,115
<i>All that sort of carnival stuff</i>
<i>that we think of.</i>

457
00:42:28,149 --> 00:42:29,950
<i>All in this one place.</i>

458
00:42:29,984 --> 00:42:33,220
<i>But the 9th & Arch Street</i>
<i>in Philadelphia</i>

459
00:42:33,254 --> 00:42:37,158
<i>is slowly beginning to fall</i>
<i>on hard times.</i>

460
00:42:38,125 --> 00:42:43,230
Because just like today,
you can shock people,

461
00:42:43,264 --> 00:42:48,002
but after a while
the shock wears off
and now you want a new shock.

462
00:42:48,035 --> 00:42:50,004
And so they're running
out of shocks.

463
00:42:50,037 --> 00:42:51,639
They're trying to figure,
"What do we do?

464
00:42:51,672 --> 00:42:54,708
How do we get people
to start coming back to this?"

465
00:42:54,742 --> 00:43:00,515
And they see
the newspaper reports
about these strange goings on

466
00:43:01,449 --> 00:43:02,517
in the woods,

467
00:43:02,551 --> 00:43:06,187
and as soon as they see that
they think, "Jackpot!"

468
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:08,022
That will bring people in.

469
00:43:08,055 --> 00:43:09,757
What they ended up doing

470
00:43:09,790 --> 00:43:13,894
was not only planting stories
it's alleged
in the local media newspapers,

471
00:43:13,928 --> 00:43:16,931
but staging Jersey Devil Hunt,

472
00:43:16,964 --> 00:43:19,667
<i>going out and claiming</i>
<i>to find something</i>

473
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:24,438
<i>and bringing it back</i>
<i>to the Arch and 9th Street</i>
<i>Museum in Philadelphia,</i>

474
00:43:24,472 --> 00:43:28,275
<i>where it could be viewed</i>
<i>for a modest fee.</i>

475
00:43:28,309 --> 00:43:30,111
<i>And so now</i>
<i>they start advertising</i>

476
00:43:30,144 --> 00:43:32,279
<i>"We've captured</i>
<i>the Jersey Devil."</i>

477
00:43:32,313 --> 00:43:33,481
<i>"Come see the Jersey Devil."</i>

478
00:43:33,515 --> 00:43:36,150
<i>And the lines</i>
<i>are now around the corner.</i>

479
00:43:36,183 --> 00:43:43,858
So the way they had it set up
in a big room, darkened room.
Cage on the stage.

480
00:43:43,891 --> 00:43:45,793
<i>You can't see what's in it.</i>

481
00:43:45,826 --> 00:43:47,529
<i>They bring a bunch of people in</i>

482
00:43:47,562 --> 00:43:51,265
<i>and there's a barker there,</i>
<i>you know,</i>
<i>"Jersey Devil eats people."</i>

483
00:43:51,298 --> 00:43:52,700
"Peek. Don't get too close.

484
00:43:52,733 --> 00:43:57,204
<i>Because you don't want to."</i>
<i>And they pull the curtain off.</i>

485
00:43:57,238 --> 00:43:58,507
<i>And here's this thing.</i>

486
00:44:02,611 --> 00:44:09,183
And what people saw
when they went into the museum,
in a cage, was a kangaroo

487
00:44:09,216 --> 00:44:12,521
that had been fitted
with some sort of

488
00:44:12,554 --> 00:44:15,422
contraption that made it look
like it had wings

489
00:44:15,456 --> 00:44:18,759
and painted
in shades or stripes of green.

490
00:44:18,792 --> 00:44:23,731
This creature,
this poor kangaroo, evidently,
there was some sort of

491
00:44:23,764 --> 00:44:28,169
sharp object
that it was poked with
and make a lot of aloud sound

492
00:44:28,202 --> 00:44:31,939
that would alarm the patrons
who had gone there to see it.

493
00:44:31,972 --> 00:44:38,212
And so, word gets out,
you know it's not real,
and so that's the end of it.

494
00:44:38,245 --> 00:44:41,849
After this, people asked them,
"Why did you fake this?"

495
00:44:41,882 --> 00:44:44,685
"We're a Dime Museum.
That's what we do.

496
00:44:44,718 --> 00:44:46,187
We fake stuff.

497
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:50,257
Why did you believe us
when we told you
we had this thing?"

498
00:44:50,291 --> 00:44:52,393
And so after a while,
you know, it all dies down.

499
00:44:52,426 --> 00:44:58,299
But why that's all important
is because now
this name Jersey Devil

500
00:44:58,332 --> 00:45:01,335
has gotten into the bloodstream

501
00:45:01,368 --> 00:45:05,172
and people start coming out
of the woodwork saying,

502
00:45:05,806 --> 00:45:07,374
<i>"I know it's real.</i>

503
00:45:07,408 --> 00:45:08,342
<i>I've seen it."</i>

504
00:45:10,311 --> 00:45:15,149
There's this thought that
this story
or series of stories

505
00:45:15,182 --> 00:45:17,985
was concocted in order
to sell newspapers.

506
00:45:18,018 --> 00:45:21,322
Because this area
saw the opportunity

507
00:45:21,355 --> 00:45:23,592
and as one paper
started to do really well,

508
00:45:23,625 --> 00:45:25,527
the next paper
would make up another story

509
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:28,462
and it would only grow and grow
and grow and grow and grow.

510
00:45:28,495 --> 00:45:30,665
<i>However, in other</i>
<i>cryptid sightings</i>

511
00:45:30,699 --> 00:45:34,401
<i>that have been primarily spread</i>
<i>by newspaper reports,</i>

512
00:45:34,435 --> 00:45:41,242
<i>There's less of</i>
<i>a vested interest</i>
<i>in that type of one-upsmanship</i>

513
00:45:41,275 --> 00:45:45,680
<i>hoax culture that would persist</i>
<i>for one week</i>
<i>and then completely disappear.</i>

514
00:45:45,714 --> 00:45:50,384
<i>What we normally see is that</i>
<i>one paper will publish a story</i>

515
00:45:50,417 --> 00:45:54,855
<i>and then the next will offer</i>
<i>rewards or potential scoops</i>

516
00:45:54,888 --> 00:45:57,592
<i>or will maybe publish a photo.</i>

517
00:45:57,626 --> 00:46:00,695
But there's not
typically this addition

518
00:46:00,729 --> 00:46:06,166
of a more complex narrative
that would quote people directly

519
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:08,302
or that would involve
the local fire department,

520
00:46:08,335 --> 00:46:11,171
for instance,
that would be less likely

521
00:46:11,205 --> 00:46:14,408
to be seen in that area
or that time period.

522
00:46:14,441 --> 00:46:17,811
It's been alleged, you know
that the 1909 sightings

523
00:46:17,845 --> 00:46:22,916
and the reports in the media
essentially launched
the Jersey Devil

524
00:46:22,950 --> 00:46:26,253
as we know it today,
and that would be
very convenient.

525
00:46:26,287 --> 00:46:29,557
But what is so interesting
is that it's simply a matter

526
00:46:29,591 --> 00:46:35,630
of record that in 1859,
which of course predates 1909,

527
00:46:35,664 --> 00:46:37,364
<i>Atlantic Monthly</i>

528
00:46:37,398 --> 00:46:39,933
<i>ran a lengthy story about a man</i>

529
00:46:39,967 --> 00:46:43,538
<i>who went to the Pine Barrens</i>
<i>and interviewed locals,</i>

530
00:46:43,571 --> 00:46:48,710
<i>some of whom</i>
<i>told him the legend</i>
<i>of the Jersey Devil.</i>

531
00:46:48,743 --> 00:46:49,910
<i>And not only that,</i>

532
00:46:49,943 --> 00:46:53,113
<i>but talking about the fact</i>
<i>that some strange creature</i>

533
00:46:53,147 --> 00:46:56,283
<i>had been seen in that area</i>
<i>ever since.</i>

534
00:46:56,317 --> 00:46:58,218
<i>And that occasionally</i>
<i>in the Pine Barrens,</i>

535
00:46:58,252 --> 00:47:02,724
<i>there's something flying about</i>
<i>or messing with</i>
<i>people's livestock.</i>

536
00:47:02,757 --> 00:47:05,492
<i>So that is the fly</i>
<i>in the ointment,</i>

537
00:47:05,527 --> 00:47:09,129
<i>as far as saying that</i>
<i>there is a neat tie to 1909,</i>

538
00:47:09,163 --> 00:47:11,899
<i>which explains it all.</i>
<i>It simply doesn't.</i>

539
00:47:14,435 --> 00:47:17,304
There are tribal beliefs
associated with that area,

540
00:47:17,338 --> 00:47:20,841
particularly in terms
of the landscape.

541
00:47:20,874 --> 00:47:25,446
So, one of the ways
that tribal communities
preserve their stories

542
00:47:25,479 --> 00:47:29,784
<i>is by having the place name</i>

543
00:47:29,818 --> 00:47:34,656
<i>of a physical place</i>
<i>tied directly to a story.</i>

544
00:47:34,689 --> 00:47:38,459
<i>In the Pine Barrens,</i>
<i>the Lenape tribes</i>

545
00:47:38,492 --> 00:47:42,129
<i>knew the area as 'Poppuessing',</i>

546
00:47:42,162 --> 00:47:44,331
<i>which meant</i>
<i>'The place of the dragon'.</i>

547
00:47:44,365 --> 00:47:46,967
<i>When Swedish settlers</i>
<i>then came into the area,</i>

548
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,703
<i>they adopted</i>
<i>a form of that name</i>

549
00:47:48,737 --> 00:47:51,806
<i>and also knew it as</i>
<i>the place of the dragon.</i>

550
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:55,242
<i>For these tribal groups,</i>
<i>it was more about the structure</i>
<i>of the place.</i>

551
00:47:55,275 --> 00:47:59,380
<i>So the land and the interaction</i>
<i>between the forests</i>
<i>and the water</i>

552
00:47:59,413 --> 00:48:01,882
<i>created spaces or inlets</i>

553
00:48:01,915 --> 00:48:06,554
<i>that were reminiscent</i>
<i>of native tribal stories</i>

554
00:48:06,588 --> 00:48:09,824
<i>that included those patterns</i>
<i>like dragons</i>

555
00:48:09,858 --> 00:48:13,394
<i>or other type</i>
<i>of monstrous creatures.</i>

556
00:48:13,427 --> 00:48:16,698
<i>And so that land</i>
<i>became known as that</i>

557
00:48:16,731 --> 00:48:21,168
<i>as the result of those.</i>
<i>Not inherently,</i>
<i>because there was a dragon</i>

558
00:48:21,201 --> 00:48:23,404
<i>that was sighted there</i>
<i>by those native folk.</i>

559
00:48:23,437 --> 00:48:26,674
There is good reason to believe
that the legend traces

560
00:48:26,708 --> 00:48:29,711
all the way back
to the Native Americans
in this area.

561
00:48:29,744 --> 00:48:35,315
The Native Americans,
in this area believed
that there was a spirit being

562
00:48:35,349 --> 00:48:39,253
that lived in the wilderness,
and they had a ceremony

563
00:48:39,286 --> 00:48:42,389
that they performed
for this spirit.

564
00:48:42,423 --> 00:48:47,027
<i>The Lenape tribe</i>
<i>had a whole variety of</i>

565
00:48:47,060 --> 00:48:50,632
<i>folkloric figures that</i>
<i>they were able to describe</i>

566
00:48:50,665 --> 00:48:52,534
<i>to the Europeans</i>
<i>when they arrived.</i>

567
00:48:52,567 --> 00:48:54,435
<i>The one that corresponds</i>

568
00:48:54,468 --> 00:49:00,608
<i>to the Jersey Devil</i>
<i>most closely was a</i>
<i>deity figure called Mising.</i>

569
00:49:00,642 --> 00:49:05,345
<i>And Mising is the one that had</i>
<i>the head and body of the deer.</i>

570
00:49:05,379 --> 00:49:09,016
<i>A male deer with antlers</i>
<i>and bat-like wings,</i>

571
00:49:09,049 --> 00:49:12,654
<i>and was seen as sort of</i>
<i>a protector of the forest.</i>

572
00:49:12,687 --> 00:49:14,556
As the European settlers
come in,

573
00:49:14,589 --> 00:49:18,258
and most of them with a very
strong religious perspective,

574
00:49:18,292 --> 00:49:20,628
there would be a crossover
that would take place

575
00:49:20,662 --> 00:49:26,433
between native legends
and beliefs in folklore
and beliefs

576
00:49:26,467 --> 00:49:29,203
<i>that were often rooted</i>
<i>in biblical Christianity.</i>

577
00:49:29,236 --> 00:49:33,006
<i>In the case of the Lenape,</i>
<i>there was a religious group</i>

578
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:35,976
<i>that they actually were able</i>
<i>to coexist with quite well,</i>

579
00:49:36,009 --> 00:49:37,044
<i>and that was the Quakers.</i>

580
00:49:37,077 --> 00:49:39,480
<i>The Quaker people</i>
<i>and the Lenape</i>

581
00:49:39,514 --> 00:49:42,517
<i>actually lived</i>
<i>very well together.</i>

582
00:49:42,550 --> 00:49:44,117
<i>But what they were</i>
<i>able to do then,</i>

583
00:49:44,151 --> 00:49:48,021
<i>of course,</i>
<i>is share their stories</i>
<i>in a non-threatening way.</i>

584
00:49:48,055 --> 00:49:50,859
<i>And so from the Lenape,</i>

585
00:49:50,892 --> 00:49:53,895
Quakers would have heard
descriptions like this

586
00:49:53,928 --> 00:49:58,165
that would have conjured images
that were,
at the very least, devilish,

587
00:49:58,198 --> 00:50:04,071
or that would have fit
sort of the artistic renderings
of demons and devils

588
00:50:04,104 --> 00:50:07,007
<i>in the 1600s and 1700s.</i>

589
00:50:10,310 --> 00:50:12,814
So the basic story
the Jersey Devil,

590
00:50:12,847 --> 00:50:16,450
and there are
variations of this,

591
00:50:16,483 --> 00:50:23,490
is that 1735, a woman
named Mother Leeds living in the
depths of the Pine Barrens

592
00:50:23,525 --> 00:50:25,860
gives birth to her 13th child.

593
00:50:25,894 --> 00:50:30,598
Mother Leeds was either a witch
or a woman

594
00:50:30,632 --> 00:50:33,635
upon whom someone had placed
a curse.

595
00:50:33,668 --> 00:50:36,571
My favorite version is the one
where the child is born

596
00:50:36,604 --> 00:50:38,773
and it looks
like a natural baby.

597
00:50:38,806 --> 00:50:42,376
But then in a short time,
even in the immediate wake

598
00:50:42,409 --> 00:50:44,946
of the delivery,
it starts to change.

599
00:50:44,979 --> 00:50:48,683
When the child was born,
it looked normal.

600
00:50:48,716 --> 00:50:52,754
But then immediately morphed
into this amalgam

601
00:50:52,787 --> 00:50:56,891
of every sort of creature
known and unknown.

602
00:50:56,925 --> 00:50:58,125
The mother's screaming.

603
00:50:58,158 --> 00:50:59,359
The midwife is screaming.

604
00:50:59,393 --> 00:51:02,396
Everyone's confused
and scared and terrified.

605
00:51:02,429 --> 00:51:05,633
The child then
burst through the door

606
00:51:05,667 --> 00:51:09,571
to the adjoining room,
where Mister Leeds

607
00:51:09,604 --> 00:51:12,540
and the prior 12 children
are all huddled,

608
00:51:12,574 --> 00:51:15,777
scared by the sounds
coming from this room.

609
00:51:15,810 --> 00:51:19,013
The creature kills
as many as it can,

610
00:51:19,047 --> 00:51:21,281
<i>and then it flies off</i>
<i>into the night,</i>

611
00:51:21,315 --> 00:51:23,785
<i>only to be seen</i>
<i>on rare occasions</i>

612
00:51:23,818 --> 00:51:27,021
<i>or by people who invoke</i>
<i>the devil themselves.</i>

613
00:51:27,055 --> 00:51:28,890
<i>You've heard it said</i>
<i>many times.</i>

614
00:51:28,923 --> 00:51:33,327
<i>There's as many</i>
<i>as 30 variations.</i>
<i>Probably more than that.</i>

615
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:35,797
<i>When Mother Leeds</i>
<i>comes into play</i>

616
00:51:35,830 --> 00:51:40,233
<i>in the early versions,</i>
<i>she's a witch</i>

617
00:51:40,267 --> 00:51:43,671
and she is able to sort of
shape shift.

618
00:51:43,705 --> 00:51:48,308
And I found a really
interesting article that made
reference to the fact that

619
00:51:48,342 --> 00:51:53,681
the Leeds Devil was sort of
a European version
of a werewolf.

620
00:51:53,715 --> 00:51:55,817
And I'm like,
"Okay, I get that part."

621
00:51:55,850 --> 00:52:00,922
<i>But then</i>
<i>there were also versions</i>
<i>that Mother Leeds</i>

622
00:52:00,955 --> 00:52:04,792
<i>had a child</i>
<i>and the father was the devil.</i>

623
00:52:05,793 --> 00:52:08,563
But the problem
with the whole story

624
00:52:09,697 --> 00:52:11,032
is that the real story,

625
00:52:11,065 --> 00:52:13,200
the Jersey Devil,
has nothing
to do with a monster.

626
00:52:13,935 --> 00:52:15,502
A physical monster.

627
00:52:15,536 --> 00:52:17,505
It's a political story.

628
00:52:17,538 --> 00:52:22,744
It is a story
that gets to the depths of

629
00:52:22,777 --> 00:52:26,279
small town culture
versus big town culture,

630
00:52:26,313 --> 00:52:31,351
religious culture,
land grabs
from Native Americans,

631
00:52:31,385 --> 00:52:34,689
the crushing of outspoken women.

632
00:52:34,722 --> 00:52:40,895
This is the beginnings
of fake news in America.

633
00:52:40,928 --> 00:52:44,999
It's the beginnings
of sensationalist
media coverage.

634
00:52:45,033 --> 00:52:48,803
It's an American thing
before there's an America.

635
00:52:48,836 --> 00:52:50,838
This sort of thing
is already going on.

636
00:52:51,405 --> 00:52:53,608
And so the the story,

637
00:52:53,641 --> 00:52:55,677
the Jersey Devil
is at the heart of that.

638
00:53:34,247 --> 00:53:35,248
Hello.

639
00:53:35,282 --> 00:53:36,751
I've been sent by the agency.

640
00:53:51,132 --> 00:53:51,999
Hello?

641
00:53:52,867 --> 00:53:54,902
I've been summoned
by your husband.

642
00:53:54,936 --> 00:53:57,270
I'm here from the agency
to offer services.

643
00:54:01,374 --> 00:54:03,845
I hope there
hasn't been a mistake.

644
00:54:07,247 --> 00:54:08,616
Hello?

645
00:54:08,649 --> 00:54:12,319
The agency sent me
on behalf of Mr. Leeds,
summoned for service.

646
00:54:13,087 --> 00:54:14,088
Is anyone at home?

647
00:54:41,082 --> 00:54:44,652
If no one is at home,
I shall have no choice
but to enter.

648
00:54:44,685 --> 00:54:46,721
My transport
has already departed.

649
00:55:48,415 --> 00:55:51,986
Hello? Mrs. Leeds?

650
00:55:53,554 --> 00:55:54,989
I can hear you up there.

651
00:55:57,959 --> 00:56:00,094
This is the Leeds residence,
is it not?

652
00:56:02,563 --> 00:56:04,999
I'm sorry again
to have let myself in,

653
00:56:05,032 --> 00:56:07,869
- but I am a long way away
from the...
Rest.

654
00:56:09,103 --> 00:56:10,071
I'm sorry?

655
00:56:10,104 --> 00:56:12,039
I only need rest.

656
00:56:12,073 --> 00:56:15,309
Make yourself at home,
but leave me to my rest.

657
00:56:15,343 --> 00:56:18,746
Mrs. Leeds, as for my duties,
we really should--

658
00:56:18,779 --> 00:56:21,582
Till tomorrow, girl. Tomorrow,

659
00:56:21,616 --> 00:56:23,951
For now, I only need rest.

660
01:01:55,816 --> 01:01:58,520
"Concerning ritual offerings.

661
01:01:58,553 --> 01:02:02,823
The 13th child is brought forth
in exchange
for a bountiful season."

662
01:02:07,828 --> 01:02:11,165
The baby is here.
It's already coming.

663
01:02:11,633 --> 01:02:13,500
I can't. I can't!

664
01:02:13,535 --> 01:02:15,936
Don't worry. Don't worry!
I'll fetch the water.

665
01:02:15,970 --> 01:02:19,006
There's no time for textbook.
It's already on its way...

666
01:02:22,443 --> 01:02:23,477
All right.

667
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:26,715
Keep breathing.

668
01:02:28,849 --> 01:02:30,585
In and out.

669
01:02:31,185 --> 01:02:32,319
Breathe well.

670
01:02:33,988 --> 01:02:35,122
Keep breathing.

671
01:02:36,323 --> 01:02:38,425
In and out.

672
01:02:39,460 --> 01:02:40,695
It's going to be all right.

673
01:02:41,262 --> 01:02:42,997
Keep breathing.

674
01:02:43,030 --> 01:02:48,369
In and out. In... Good.

675
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:53,173
Very good.

676
01:02:53,207 --> 01:02:55,476
It's going
to be all right, Mrs. Leeds.

677
01:03:57,071 --> 01:04:01,008
Daniel Leeds.
He's the central character.

678
01:04:01,041 --> 01:04:02,544
He's what the whole story...

679
01:04:02,577 --> 01:04:05,680
If there's no Daniel Leeds,
there's no Jersey Devil.

680
01:04:05,714 --> 01:04:07,281
<i>He's this</i>
<i>really interesting guy.</i>

681
01:04:07,314 --> 01:04:08,650
<i>He's a Quaker.</i>

682
01:04:08,683 --> 01:04:10,518
<i>The Quakers</i>
<i>were people in England.</i>

683
01:04:10,552 --> 01:04:12,754
<i>They're religious people.</i>
<i>They are Christians</i>

684
01:04:12,787 --> 01:04:17,057
<i>who are separatists</i>
<i>from the mainstream</i>
<i>Anglican church.</i>

685
01:04:17,091 --> 01:04:20,695
<i>The Anglicans don't like...</i>
<i>the Puritans hate the Quakers.</i>

686
01:04:20,729 --> 01:04:24,532
<i>So there are laws being passed</i>
<i>in England,</i>

687
01:04:24,566 --> 01:04:28,435
<i>Anti-Quaker laws,</i>
<i>because they saw the Quakers</i>
<i>as subversive.</i>

688
01:04:28,469 --> 01:04:32,774
<i>And so what they decide to do</i>
<i>is some of them come here</i>

689
01:04:32,807 --> 01:04:36,310
<i>to what is then</i>
<i>British North America.</i>

690
01:04:37,579 --> 01:04:41,549
<i>And now we're talking about</i>
<i>1650s, 1660s.</i>

691
01:04:42,182 --> 01:04:43,785
<i>Young. He's like 25.</i>

692
01:04:43,818 --> 01:04:48,021
He comes from England.
He comes with his father
and his two brothers.

693
01:04:48,055 --> 01:04:50,592
<i>His contribution to life</i>
<i>will be,</i>

694
01:04:50,625 --> 01:04:56,296
<i>he's gonna bring the tenants</i>
<i>of the scientific revolution</i>

695
01:04:56,330 --> 01:05:00,067
<i>and the age of enlightenment</i>
<i>to North America.</i>

696
01:05:00,100 --> 01:05:01,468
<i>And remember at the time,</i>

697
01:05:01,502 --> 01:05:06,841
<i>In the late 1600s, America</i>
<i>is the edge of the empire.</i>

698
01:05:06,875 --> 01:05:10,377
Rather than having 13 children,
he did have 12.

699
01:05:10,411 --> 01:05:15,149
One of whom was Titan Leeds,
the son of Daniel Leeds.

700
01:05:15,182 --> 01:05:16,885
So one of the ways

701
01:05:16,917 --> 01:05:20,822
in which Daniel made his mark
in his community

702
01:05:20,855 --> 01:05:23,123
<i>was by settling an area.</i>

703
01:05:23,157 --> 01:05:24,258
<i>He was a land surveyor,</i>

704
01:05:24,291 --> 01:05:25,593
<i>so he was gifted</i>
<i>a piece of land</i>

705
01:05:25,627 --> 01:05:29,163
<i>in order to survey it</i>
<i>for the kingdom.</i>

706
01:05:29,196 --> 01:05:31,633
<i>And he named it Leeds Town.</i>

707
01:05:31,666 --> 01:05:36,103
<i>And while he was there,</i>
<i>he started his own almanac.</i>

708
01:05:36,136 --> 01:05:37,337
<i>And he thinks, "Okay,</i>

709
01:05:37,371 --> 01:05:39,940
<i>this is where I'm going</i>
<i>to start this thing.</i>

710
01:05:39,973 --> 01:05:41,776
<i>I'm gonna bring education.</i>

711
01:05:41,810 --> 01:05:45,914
<i>I want to bring area addition</i>
<i>to the to the wilderness."</i>

712
01:05:45,946 --> 01:05:49,283
<i>And the Quaker fathers</i>
<i>of Burlington hate him.</i>

713
01:05:50,284 --> 01:05:52,887
<i>They think it's too occulty,</i>

714
01:05:53,922 --> 01:05:55,790
<i>they think it's unchristian</i>

715
01:05:57,625 --> 01:05:58,959
<i>and they want to get rid of it.</i>

716
01:05:59,993 --> 01:06:04,965
<i>And they literally go around</i>
<i>and they buy up</i>

717
01:06:04,998 --> 01:06:08,135
<i>every copy that's gotten out</i>
<i>into circulation</i>

718
01:06:08,168 --> 01:06:09,804
and they burn them.

719
01:06:09,838 --> 01:06:13,974
So Daniel Leeds, not just
the first author in New Jersey.

720
01:06:14,007 --> 01:06:16,544
He's the first censored
author in New Jersey.

721
01:06:16,578 --> 01:06:20,682
They viewed his almanac
as too astrological

722
01:06:20,715 --> 01:06:26,487
and is promoting a more esoteric

723
01:06:26,521 --> 01:06:29,456
understanding of nature
and not something grounded

724
01:06:29,490 --> 01:06:33,393
in, you know,
thoughts related to God

725
01:06:33,427 --> 01:06:35,996
or like God's prophecies,
or communicating with God.

726
01:06:36,029 --> 01:06:40,367
So, originally, the almanac
was published
under the Quaker Society.

727
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:43,003
But after the Quakers
pushed back,

728
01:06:43,036 --> 01:06:48,041
<i>Daniel decided to publish</i>
<i>under his own kind of arm</i>
<i>or branch instead.</i>

729
01:06:48,075 --> 01:06:51,746
<i>And so, the publishing changed,</i>
<i>and he leaned more</i>

730
01:06:51,779 --> 01:06:54,782
<i>into the astrological</i>
<i>end of things.</i>

731
01:06:54,816 --> 01:06:57,719
<i>He published an almanac</i>
<i>that was based on astrology,</i>

732
01:06:57,752 --> 01:07:00,989
<i>he went on to write a book</i>
<i>called the</i> Temple of <i>Wisdom,</i>

733
01:07:01,021 --> 01:07:05,092
<i>in which he tried to synthesize</i>
<i> all these streams of thought,</i>

734
01:07:05,125 --> 01:07:07,461
<i>both of which the Quakers</i>
<i>were very much against.</i>

735
01:07:07,494 --> 01:07:11,933
<i>They demanded an apology</i>
<i>from him,</i>
<i>which he gave under duress.</i>

736
01:07:11,966 --> 01:07:13,735
<i>But then he went on</i>
<i>to write these pamphlets</i>

737
01:07:13,768 --> 01:07:16,203
<i>that were</i>
<i>virulently anti-Quaker.</i>

738
01:07:16,236 --> 01:07:21,843
<i>And again, that got him</i>
<i>labeled as the</i>
<i>Leeds Devil, essentially.</i>

739
01:07:21,876 --> 01:07:24,779
<i>And he flips</i>
<i>on the Quakers.</i>

740
01:07:24,812 --> 01:07:29,149
<i>He converts to Anglicanism,</i>
<i>he starts putting out</i>
<i>a new version</i>

741
01:07:29,182 --> 01:07:32,654
<i>of the almanac in which</i>
<i>he basically attacks Quakerism</i>

742
01:07:33,220 --> 01:07:34,388
<i>in every issue.</i>

743
01:07:35,489 --> 01:07:37,291
<i>The Quakers are liars.</i>

744
01:07:37,324 --> 01:07:40,628
<i>The Quakers are this.</i>
<i>The Quakers are that.</i>
<i>The Quakers are bad people.</i>

745
01:07:40,662 --> 01:07:47,802
<i>The Quakers get mad,</i>
<i>so they start publishing</i>
<i>anti-Daniel Leeds pamphlets.</i>

746
01:07:47,835 --> 01:07:52,006
<i>And so there's this kind of</i>
<i>tennis match</i>
<i>going back and forth</i>

747
01:07:52,040 --> 01:07:55,810
<i>where Leeds publishes</i>
<i>an anti-Quaker pamphlet,</i>

748
01:07:55,843 --> 01:07:58,580
the Quakers publish
an anti-Leeds pamphlet,

749
01:07:58,613 --> 01:08:01,148
and it goes on and on
like that for a while.

750
01:08:01,181 --> 01:08:06,320
There were some instances
of anti-Quaker propaganda

751
01:08:06,353 --> 01:08:10,457
and then responses
that were made
by the Quaker groups,

752
01:08:10,490 --> 01:08:13,360
including, you know
referring to Daniel Leeds

753
01:08:13,393 --> 01:08:15,362
<i>in some instances</i>
<i>as the Devil himself.</i>

754
01:08:15,395 --> 01:08:20,500
<i>As he continued his separation</i>
<i>from the Quakers,</i>
<i>he started to include</i>

755
01:08:20,535 --> 01:08:26,040
<i>his family crest on</i>
<i>the almanac, which</i>
<i>included dragons on it,</i>

756
01:08:26,074 --> 01:08:29,010
<i>and that was seen</i>
<i>as a further evidence</i>

757
01:08:29,043 --> 01:08:34,616
of a ultimately evil
interaction with Satan

758
01:08:34,649 --> 01:08:37,284
through his publication
of that text.

759
01:08:37,317 --> 01:08:44,257
That whole pamphlet war
between Daniel Leeds
and the Quakers.

760
01:08:44,291 --> 01:08:47,562
Quakers accusing him
of being Satan's harbinger,
of being evil.

761
01:08:47,595 --> 01:08:51,231
<i>Obviously, that's the ultimate</i>
<i>source of that.</i>

762
01:08:51,264 --> 01:08:53,101
<i>There's two monsters here.</i>

763
01:08:53,133 --> 01:08:57,304
<i>There is the Jersey Devil,</i>
<i>but there's also</i>
<i>the Leeds Devil,</i>

764
01:08:57,337 --> 01:08:59,007
<i>which comes out first.</i>

765
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:02,744
<i>The Leeds Devil is much more</i>
<i>of a political animal.</i>

766
01:09:02,777 --> 01:09:07,582
<i>Now, did the Quakers plan</i>
<i>on creating a monster legend?</i>

767
01:09:07,615 --> 01:09:09,216
<i>You know, probably not.</i>

768
01:09:09,249 --> 01:09:14,122
<i>I think that's</i>
<i>the ultimate genesis,</i>
<i>which takes us, you know,</i>

769
01:09:14,154 --> 01:09:17,992
<i>two-hundred-some years later</i>
<i>to the thing</i>
<i>we know today.</i>

770
01:09:19,060 --> 01:09:21,896
Now, this is not attached
to a monster yet.

771
01:09:21,929 --> 01:09:23,898
It's still just
a political idea.

772
01:09:25,033 --> 01:09:29,003
Revolution comes along
and then the years go by.

773
01:09:29,037 --> 01:09:33,173
<i>By the end of the 18th</i>
<i>into the early 19th century,</i>

774
01:09:33,206 --> 01:09:35,677
<i>up until around the time</i>
<i>of the Civil War,</i>

775
01:09:35,710 --> 01:09:39,279
<i>the idea of the Leeds Devil</i>
<i>basically has gone extinct.</i>

776
01:09:39,312 --> 01:09:44,552
<i>But in the second half</i>
<i>of the 19th century,</i>
<i>post-Civil War,</i>

777
01:09:44,585 --> 01:09:48,790
<i>you start to get people</i>
<i>talking about</i>
<i>the Leeds Devil again.</i>

778
01:09:52,927 --> 01:09:55,797
<i>When we tell</i>
<i>the Jersey Devil story,</i>

779
01:09:55,830 --> 01:09:57,832
how much of the details
can we change

780
01:09:57,865 --> 01:10:01,035
until it's no longer
the Jersey Devil story
and it's something else?

781
01:10:01,069 --> 01:10:06,140
How critical are the Leeds
to the story being understood
and replicated?

782
01:10:06,174 --> 01:10:09,944
Because if we think about it,
there are tons of versions

783
01:10:09,977 --> 01:10:14,414
where Mother Leeds has these
different roles that she plays.

784
01:10:14,448 --> 01:10:19,887
In some, she is the wife
of a wealthy,
well-providing man.

785
01:10:19,921 --> 01:10:24,759
In some, she's the wife
of a drunkard
who treats her horribly,

786
01:10:24,792 --> 01:10:27,294
abuses their family,
is the worst in the world.

787
01:10:27,327 --> 01:10:30,832
In some, she is
a practicing witch,
going against all of the

788
01:10:30,865 --> 01:10:33,835
Christian and Quaker values
that one could possibly have.

789
01:10:33,868 --> 01:10:35,870
<i>In some, she's a scorned lover.</i>

790
01:10:35,903 --> 01:10:37,905
<i>I mean, it ranges</i>
<i>all across the place</i>

791
01:10:37,939 --> 01:10:41,008
<i>for where the origin</i>
<i>of this creature came from.</i>

792
01:10:41,042 --> 01:10:44,344
<i>But all of it</i>
<i>ties back to her,</i>

793
01:10:44,377 --> 01:10:47,181
<i>she becomes</i>
<i>this central figure.</i>

794
01:10:47,215 --> 01:10:51,986
<i>So is she really</i>
<i>the protagonist of</i>
<i>the Jersey Devil story?</i>

795
01:10:52,019 --> 01:10:55,723
Early in the 1600,
this is like 1630, 1640,

796
01:10:55,757 --> 01:10:58,159
there was a woman
named Anne Hutchinson,

797
01:10:58,192 --> 01:11:01,863
<i>who was also nonconformist,</i>
<i>ran into problems</i>

798
01:11:01,896 --> 01:11:06,601
<i>with the Puritan Church</i>
<i>in Boston and got kicked</i>
<i>out of Boston, essentially.</i>

799
01:11:06,634 --> 01:11:09,070
<i>Settled in Providence,</i>
<i>Rhode Island.</i>

800
01:11:09,103 --> 01:11:12,840
<i>Had a number of children,</i>
<i>as many as 16.</i>

801
01:11:12,874 --> 01:11:18,478
<i>The 16th child that she had</i>
<i>was by our thinking today,</i>

802
01:11:18,513 --> 01:11:21,916
our terminology,
was a miscarriage.

803
01:11:21,949 --> 01:11:24,484
And somehow that became
public knowledge,

804
01:11:24,519 --> 01:11:29,356
and the Puritans found out
about it and used it as a way
to smear her name.

805
01:11:29,389 --> 01:11:32,894
Essentially, by saying,
look, you know, here she is,

806
01:11:32,927 --> 01:11:36,831
this rebellious woman.
She's pushed
against orthodoxies

807
01:11:36,864 --> 01:11:39,734
and she had this horrible birth,

808
01:11:39,767 --> 01:11:43,638
you know, monstrous birth,
by some accounts.

809
01:11:43,671 --> 01:11:48,375
And it's just she's getting
what she deserved,
is what they were

810
01:11:48,408 --> 01:11:50,545
probably more than implying.

811
01:11:50,578 --> 01:11:56,184
So, that sets in
by the mid-1600s,

812
01:11:56,217 --> 01:12:00,221
this idea in some of the
public's consciousness

813
01:12:00,254 --> 01:12:06,060
that a result or consequence
for pushing
against historical orthodoxies

814
01:12:06,093 --> 01:12:11,498
<i>could be that you'd be</i>
<i>punished in a very sad</i>
<i>and grotesque way.</i>

815
01:12:11,532 --> 01:12:15,603
<i>And you see some crossover</i>
<i>between Hutchinson</i>
<i>and the story of Mother Leeds.</i>

816
01:12:15,636 --> 01:12:17,404
<i>It's fairly obvious.</i>

817
01:12:19,941 --> 01:12:22,910
Our book,
<i>The Secret Life</i>
<i>Of The Jersey Devil.</i>

818
01:12:22,944 --> 01:12:26,180
It is, in large part,
a biography of the Leeds family.

819
01:12:26,214 --> 01:12:30,117
Because they are at the heart
of this whole thing,
especially Daniel Leeds.

820
01:12:30,151 --> 01:12:32,086
And what's also interesting
is by the time

821
01:12:32,119 --> 01:12:35,156
the term 'Leeds Devil'
comes along,

822
01:12:35,189 --> 01:12:37,792
Daniel and Titan Leeds
are gone.

823
01:12:37,825 --> 01:12:39,392
They never really know

824
01:12:39,426 --> 01:12:43,798
that they've been accused,
that they played
the part in this story.

825
01:12:43,831 --> 01:12:46,968
<i>There is no monster.</i>

826
01:12:47,001 --> 01:12:52,006
<i>I don't think necessarily</i>
<i>that the historical precedent,</i>

827
01:12:52,039 --> 01:12:55,076
although it's
extremely intriguing,

828
01:12:55,109 --> 01:13:02,049
and the Leeds story as sort of
apocryphal and clearly folklore

829
01:13:02,083 --> 01:13:03,618
rather than reporting fact.

830
01:13:03,651 --> 01:13:05,887
Because as clear as
that would seem to be,

831
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:11,859
<i>that doesn't disprove the idea</i>
<i>that there's something</i>
<i>physically strange</i>

832
01:13:11,893 --> 01:13:16,463
<i>or at least startling</i>
<i>that no one could find</i>
<i>in the Pine Barrens.</i>

833
01:13:16,496 --> 01:13:20,902
<i>So what that is, is if it's</i>
<i>a horse with bat wings,</i>

834
01:13:20,935 --> 01:13:22,904
<i>I mean, I have my doubts</i>
<i>about that.</i>

835
01:13:22,937 --> 01:13:25,940
<i>But it's not out of the realm</i>
<i>of possibility that</i>

836
01:13:25,973 --> 01:13:29,844
<i>something strange or misshapen</i>
<i>or simply undiscovered,</i>

837
01:13:29,877 --> 01:13:31,612
<i>people are encountering that.</i>

838
01:13:31,646 --> 01:13:35,883
<i>That seems to be the case</i>
<i>wherever people are</i>
<i>on these spaces,</i>

839
01:13:35,917 --> 01:13:39,186
<i>you know, away from the city,</i>
<i>away from the suburbs,</i>

840
01:13:39,220 --> 01:13:43,224
<i>and, you know,</i>
<i>off of their comfortable turf.</i>

841
01:13:43,257 --> 01:13:46,727
<i>We tend to bump into things</i>
<i>that we can't recognize</i>
<i>right away.</i>

842
01:13:51,966 --> 01:13:54,467
I believe that when people
were encountering

843
01:13:54,501 --> 01:13:57,238
definitely the Leeds Devil,

844
01:13:57,271 --> 01:14:00,007
that they were seeing
multiple creatures.

845
01:14:00,041 --> 01:14:04,812
And it's just because
if you were to line up
all the different descriptions

846
01:14:04,845 --> 01:14:08,448
that people, especially
in the 1909 sightings,
what they were seeing,

847
01:14:09,784 --> 01:14:13,154
it can't be the same creature.

848
01:14:13,187 --> 01:14:16,824
<i>People are seeing</i>
<i>multiple known creatures,</i>

849
01:14:16,857 --> 01:14:18,192
<i>but because</i>
<i>in the back of their mind</i>

850
01:14:18,225 --> 01:14:21,461
<i>they've got, "There's a devil</i>
<i>out here somewhere.</i>

851
01:14:21,494 --> 01:14:22,530
<i>I bet that's what I heard.</i>

852
01:14:22,563 --> 01:14:24,231
<i>I bet that's what I saw."</i>

853
01:14:24,265 --> 01:14:28,102
<i>Now, that being said,</i>
<i>those do not explain</i>
<i>all of the sightings.</i>

854
01:14:29,537 --> 01:14:33,441
I think that different people
have seen different things

855
01:14:33,473 --> 01:14:38,980
or heard different things
and attributed that
to a Jersey Devil sighting,

856
01:14:39,013 --> 01:14:41,849
<i>even though they had</i>
<i>different experiences,</i>

857
01:14:41,882 --> 01:14:44,885
<i>they're all calling it</i>
<i>a Jersey Devil encounter.</i>

858
01:14:44,919 --> 01:14:51,559
<i>But I think there's also</i>
<i>the possibility that we all</i>
<i>carry around some imagery</i>

859
01:14:51,592 --> 01:14:55,396
<i>in our minds that, you know,</i>
<i>is common throughout the world.</i>

860
01:14:55,429 --> 01:15:00,201
<i>When you think about everything</i>
<i>from totem pole figures to</i>

861
01:15:00,234 --> 01:15:05,006
<i>gargoyles to, you know,</i>
<i>demonic-looking figures</i>

862
01:15:05,039 --> 01:15:08,175
<i>that are depicted</i>
<i>in China or India.</i>

863
01:15:08,209 --> 01:15:11,946
<i>All over the world, people have</i>
<i>this kind of imagery</i>

864
01:15:11,979 --> 01:15:14,548
<i>that emerges in different forms</i>
<i>of art.</i>

865
01:15:14,582 --> 01:15:19,420
<i>I think it's possible that</i>
<i>during a frightening moment,</i>
<i>when you're</i>

866
01:15:19,453 --> 01:15:23,090
<i>maybe by yourself out</i>
<i>in the woods and you've</i>
<i>heard a strange sound</i>

867
01:15:23,124 --> 01:15:26,093
<i>or you saw a form</i>
<i>that startled you,</i>

868
01:15:26,127 --> 01:15:28,462
<i>it might trigger</i>
<i>that kind of imagery.</i>

869
01:15:31,198 --> 01:15:33,200
<i>I can only speculate,</i>
<i>but that's the only way</i>

870
01:15:33,234 --> 01:15:36,303
<i>I can account for the fact</i>
<i>that so many people</i>
<i>have claimed</i>

871
01:15:36,337 --> 01:15:39,740
<i>to have seen the same,</i>
<i>you know, or roughly</i>
<i>the same thing.</i>
