Tilt your head slightly to the left.

27

Hence you watch...
Roderick, what do you do?

34
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:55,569
Why are you always
arming problems?

35
00:03:55,611 --> 00:03:59,031
Try to pay attention to the world.

36
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:03,368
What happened here?
Take your paint...

37
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,245

- Gustav?
- What?

54
00:05:25,409 --> 00:05:30,414
Yes you need to see a doctor
by these headaches.

55
00:05:47,723 --> 00:05:49,600
Very grateful.

56
00:05:51,226 --> 00:05:54,104

Bravo, Gustav!

Well, Matthew,

...

71
00:07:20,524 --> 00:07:24,027

72
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:27,114
- Great.

You said six million?

75
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:41,879
Here is my hero.

76
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,131
Isabelle... Thanks.

- Come on, waiting journalists.
- No, no...

78
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:49,845
- Yes, they are just a couple.
- OK.

79
00:07:49,887 --> 00:07:51,597
Mr. Spiller...

80
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:57,352
Is it true you have an offer
to move his work to New York?

81
00:07:57,644 --> 00:08:01,481
- Yes
- Does that mean you accept the offer?

82
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:11,617
- We are pleased to announce...
- No, I have no plans, I...

Here I have everything I need.

86
00:08:31,303 --> 00:08:33,263
I was right.

87
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,852
Is not that true?

88
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:50,864
Did you hear how everyone
said you were perfect?

89
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:07,172
Do not look well.

90
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:12,386

Is impossible.

104
00:11:55,215 --> 00:12:00,304

Is there a problem with that?

116
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:43,991
Just thought you were going to take a break
after exposure.

117
00:13:44,032 --> 00:13:46,285
Well, I will not.

164
00:21:49,518 --> 00:21:52,563
Going to robármelos, Matthew.

Well, I love you.

185
00:23:54,893 --> 00:23:56,728
I love you.

186
00:24:01,483 --> 00:24:03,277
Watch.

187
00:24:18,125 --> 00:24:20,210
Everything will be fine.

188
00:24:21,295 --> 00:24:23,505
'll Go see Sam.

189
00:24:24,464 --> 00:24:26,550
Everything will be fine.

190
00:24:30,387 --> 00:24:32,097
Matthew...

191
00:24:35,893 --> 00:24:37,519
I love you.

192
00:24:55,913 --> 00:24:57,289
No.

193
00:24:58,957 --> 00:25:05,297
No, Roderick, I killed my friend,
I killed my good friend.

194
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:07,341
How could I...?

195
00:25:07,382 --> 00:25:08,842
Yes, yes.

196
00:25:09,676 --> 00:25:11,762
You're right, Madeline.

197
00:25:12,054 --> 00:25:14,515
Now nobody will separate from me.

198
00:25:14,556 --> 00:25:17,684
There is still one more, Edgar?

199
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,688
I do not understand.

200
00:25:41,166 --> 00:25:45,504
- Sam, what are we going to do with Gustav?
- After New York.

201
00:25:45,546 --> 00:25:49,091
'll See if I
rescue these contracts.

202
00:25:56,723 --> 00:26:00,477
Okay, agreed.

203
00:26:11,029 --> 00:26:12,990
Madeline, I...

204
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:16,368
'm not sure we have
to do this.

205
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:19,586
But you know how much I love you.

206
00:26:19,621 --> 00:26:22,875
I also love you,
Roderick, but...

207
00:26:22,958 --> 00:26:26,253
not in the same way that...

208
00:26:27,171 --> 00:26:30,591
I love Madeline.

209
00:26:34,678 --> 00:26:36,847
- What are you doing?
- What?

210
00:26:37,472 --> 00:26:43,395
I said what I have to do.
Just one more, one more, and are safe.

211
00:26:44,646 --> 00:26:48,192
Gustav, what are you talking about?

212
00:26:48,233 --> 00:26:51,778
Madeline and Roderick, I was told...

213
00:26:51,945 --> 00:26:57,910
Isabelle is jealous and wants to destroy them.

214
00:26:57,993 --> 00:27:03,916
- My friends told me.
- Everything happened in your head.

215
00:27:05,334 --> 00:27:10,839
- This is not true, not true.
- No, Matthew, is absolutely true.

216
00:27:10,874 --> 00:27:14,968
Saw Sam and Nicky die.

217
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:18,430
Their lives disappeared.

218
00:27:19,181 --> 00:27:21,892
By work of these hands.

219
00:27:24,436 --> 00:27:28,148
Is mescaline.
You're hallucinating, Gustav.

220
00:27:30,234 --> 00:27:31,902
Mescaline?

221
00:27:32,402 --> 00:27:34,363
What are you talking about?

222
00:27:34,863 --> 00:27:36,448

224
00:27:45,332 --> 00:27:47,709
This did not happen.

225
00:27:53,841 --> 00:27:56,343
As you're hallucinating, Gustav.

226
00:27:59,763 --> 00:28:02,975
You did not have to kill anyone.

227
00:28:04,643 --> 00:28:08,647
Not supposed to kill anyone.

228
00:28:08,981 --> 00:28:11,024
Please let her go.

229
00:28:11,692 --> 00:28:15,112
She did nothing, let her go.

230
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:19,366
- She did nothing, please.
- No...

231
00:28:20,909 --> 00:28:24,204

Yes... There are too many files there...

260

Do you know of some cases juicy?

261
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:37,749
- Juicy Cases?
- I need something for the newspaper.

262
00:33:03,984 --> 00:33:08,071

00:35:57,908 --> 00:36:02,746
Yes, right there.
It looks like a platypus.

And I need permits
because otherwise they can not come to the tour.

281
00:36:50,419 --> 00:36:56,300
Okay, let's talk about yesterday.
Does anyone remember what we saw conflict?

282
00:36:57,718 --> 00:37:00,804
- Yes, Claire.
- War of 1812?

283
00:37:00,846 --> 00:37:06,476
Right. The War of 1812 was a
of the worst in US history.

284
00:37:06,518 --> 00:37:12,107
Started by
forced recruitments made by the Royal Navy...

285
00:37:41,261 --> 00:37:43,430
Steven?

286
00:37:44,765 --> 00:37:48,018
Steven, what is more important
out in class?

287
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:50,103
No...

288
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,864
Okay, pay attention, okay?

289
00:38:00,906 --> 00:38:03,367
- Yes, miss.
- Thank You.

290
00:38:03,408 --> 00:38:07,704
Well, I want to read Chapter 4,
because that is all explained...

291
00:38:07,746 --> 00:38:12,042
and the test will be about that,
so best to be prepared.

292
00:38:13,377 --> 00:38:18,006

300
00:38:47,452 --> 00:38:48,996

310
00:41:38,749 --> 00:41:43,378
Why are you always so quiet?
Say something.

311
00:41:45,506 --> 00:41:47,132
Hello.

319
00:44:06,063 --> 00:44:09,358

00:50:14,056 --> 00:50:15,682
- Hello.
- Hi.

362
00:50:15,891 --> 00:50:20,145
- What did?
- Well, he...

363
00:50:23,565 --> 00:50:25,943
I fished with this.

364
00:50:32,074 --> 00:50:33,659
So what?

365
00:50:34,451 --> 00:50:38,664
- Well, I...
- Why this made me come?

366
00:50:38,705 --> 00:50:42,459
Why a porn magazine?
Steven, come on.

367
00:50:46,922 --> 00:50:50,884
- I noticed the marks.
- Pardon?

368
00:50:51,218 --> 00:50:53,971
In his neck.

369
00:50:56,265 --> 00:50:58,141
So what?

370
00:50:58,475 --> 00:51:01,019
What are fingerprints.

371
00:51:01,061 --> 00:51:05,440
- Children get hurt.
- From an adult hand.

372
00:51:09,444 --> 00:51:12,072
I do not like where this conversation
points.

373
00:51:12,114 --> 00:51:15,325
Well, it's my duty as a teacher
care for my students.

374
00:51:17,536 --> 00:51:21,415
How old are you? ¿23?

375
00:51:22,082 --> 00:51:24,543
25?

376
00:51:25,002 --> 00:51:30,340
I do not like at all
neither you nor your insinuations, pendejita.

377
00:51:31,758 --> 00:51:34,810
Working 12 hours a day
and look after him.

378
00:51:34,845 --> 00:51:40,017
I do not need anyone meta
my privacy and my son.

379
00:51:40,058 --> 00:51:42,769
- Is not your concern.
- But, Dad...

380
00:51:42,811 --> 00:51:44,855
Chito mouth!

381
00:51:47,274 --> 00:51:49,776
I'll handle this.

382
00:52:44,289 --> 00:52:47,668
- Hello, Susan.
- Hello, what brings you here?

383
00:52:48,836 --> 00:52:52,089
Have the direction of Steven
Nansworth?

384
00:52:52,130 --> 00:52:55,217
Know I can not give you that.

385
00:52:55,425 --> 00:52:59,513
I know, but forgot
notebook and you need to do a task...

386
00:52:59,555 --> 00:53:02,266
so it occurred to me I could
take him on my way home.

387
00:53:06,562 --> 00:53:10,190
You're lucky to have a teacher like you.

388
00:54:47,204 --> 00:54:50,666
No, wait here.

389
00:55:07,558 --> 00:55:09,726
First...

390
00:55:11,103 --> 00:55:14,273
How did you get those marks on your neck?

391
00:55:17,609 --> 00:55:20,028
Answer me.

392
00:55:21,697 --> 00:55:24,825
What is your problem?

393
00:55:33,250 --> 00:55:36,420
Do you think you'll do with this
man?

394
00:55:39,298 --> 00:55:42,759
Like this? Huh?

395
00:55:48,974 --> 00:55:52,895
Like this? Do you like it?

396
00:55:54,605 --> 00:55:58,066
Huh?
Idiot son of thousand bitches!

397
00:55:58,108 --> 00:56:01,528
You'll see what awaits you.

398
00:56:07,868 --> 00:56:10,287
Exemplary punishment awaits.

399
00:59:57,806 --> 00:59:59,099
Hi, yes...

400
01:00:31,507 --> 01:00:35,552
- Steven?
- Miss Lorne.

401
01:00:38,597 --> 01:00:40,474
Oh, my God.

402
01:00:41,433 --> 01:00:43,811

403
01:00:44,478 --> 01:00:47,272

The mind is incredibly tough.

415
01:04:01,967 --> 01:04:07,389
<i>The worse the truth, the greater
fantasy.

416

421

You are not real.

01:27:12,983 --> 01:27:15,486
there anyone want to introduce.

541
01:27:22,159 --> 01:27:24,203
Is Dr. Williams..

542
01:27:25,245 --> 01:27:27,080
Hi, James.

543
01:27:54,650 --> 01:27:56,401
<i>James.

544
01:28:16,547 --> 01:28:20,175
Allison, please
not let them take me!

545
01:28:20,509 --> 01:28:22,636
Not let them take me!

546
01:28:22,845 --> 01:28:25,139
Please stop them!

547
01:28:25,556 --> 01:28:27,349
Allison!

548
01:28:35,232 --> 01:28:37,067
Day 643

549
01:28:39,403 --> 01:28:41,697
Or maybe...

550
01:28:42,573 --> 01:28:44,074
644

551
01:28:44,116 --> 01:28:47,244
I can no longer sleep.

552
01:28:50,414 --> 01:28:52,249
Sounds...

553
01:28:52,583 --> 01:28:55,043
seem to be increasing.

554
01:28:56,628 --> 01:28:59,882
I'm starting to hallucinate again...

555
01:28:59,923 --> 01:29:03,385
and I can be in the final stages of
high pressure neurological syndrome.

556
01:29:03,427 --> 01:29:04,636
Yesterday...

557
01:29:07,055 --> 01:29:08,474
Basta!

558
01:29:08,515 --> 01:29:10,476
<i>You have to listen.

559
01:29:11,101 --> 01:29:12,978
Hear what?

560
01:29:13,228 --> 01:29:15,189
Your lies?

561
01:29:15,522 --> 01:29:17,691
This is all in my head.

562
01:29:19,735 --> 01:29:23,322
This is not real.
I know what happened, I saw it, I saw it.

563
01:29:23,357 --> 01:29:26,909
<i>I know what you think happened
, James.

564
01:29:26,950 --> 01:29:30,621
<i>But the truth is that
failed the end of the world.

565
01:29:30,662 --> 01:29:34,249
<i>All Things
and all are still here...

566
01:29:34,291 --> 01:29:36,668
<i>waiting to come out.

567
01:29:42,090 --> 01:29:43,926
All?

568
01:29:48,138 --> 01:29:50,015
Does my wife?

569
01:29:50,974 --> 01:29:52,810
Will my children?

570
01:29:53,352 --> 01:29:55,229
Does my family?

571
01:29:57,981 --> 01:30:00,192
You really are good?

572
01:30:06,406 --> 01:30:08,450
're Lying.

573
01:30:09,117 --> 01:30:11,995
I know you're lying,
can not be otherwise.

574
01:30:12,037 --> 01:30:14,206
<i>You were boarding
when you disappeared.

575
01:30:14,248 --> 01:30:16,375
<i>I have been waiting
since.

576
01:30:16,416 --> 01:30:18,001
I Internado why?

577
01:30:18,043 --> 01:30:19,628
<i>Do not you remember?

578
01:30:19,962 --> 01:30:21,463
<i>You had a nervous breakdown.

579
01:30:21,498 --> 01:30:24,045
I did not collapse!

580
01:30:24,080 --> 01:30:26,593
Can you hear me? Can you hear me?

581
01:30:26,969 --> 01:30:28,887
I know have died!

582
01:30:29,096 --> 01:30:33,183
I do not believe anything you say,
this is just another hallucination.

583
01:30:33,225 --> 01:30:35,018
<i>James, please listen.

584
01:30:35,060 --> 01:30:36,603
No, no.

585
01:30:36,645 --> 01:30:39,439
If that's true, then
Where is my wife?

586
01:30:39,481 --> 01:30:41,358
Why is not she
here to tell me?

587
01:30:41,400 --> 01:30:45,863
<i>Calm down, James.
Do not be afraid.

588
01:30:45,904 --> 01:30:48,907
What calms me?
Would you calm down?

589
01:30:48,949 --> 01:30:51,952
My wife is not here because he died
!

590
01:30:53,662 --> 01:30:55,873
All died!

591
01:30:57,082 --> 01:31:02,254
The December 21, 2012
everything was destroyed, everything.

592
01:31:02,296 --> 01:31:04,631
<i>
Your predictions were wrong.

593
01:31:05,757 --> 01:31:07,384
<i>I became obsessed.

594
01:31:07,426 --> 01:31:09,678
I'm Not Obsessed!

595
01:31:09,720 --> 01:31:13,098
<i>James, you have to open the hatch
.

596
01:31:14,933 --> 01:31:19,458
I know what happened, I know.
I saw him, saw his ships.

597
01:31:19,493 --> 01:31:23,984
I heard bombs.
I know they arrived.

598
01:31:24,026 --> 01:31:27,488
I know.
's All here.

599
01:31:28,197 --> 01:31:30,157
Lynette Jones,
abducted at age 13...

600
01:31:30,199 --> 01:31:33,243
aliens to implant communication devices.

601
01:31:33,285 --> 01:31:37,956
Lenny Captain Hammer,
member of Majestic 12 disappears.

602
01:31:38,707 --> 01:31:43,796
The Mayans did not predict anything,
were giving us a message.

603
01:31:43,879 --> 01:31:47,382
But we destroyed almost everything, so it was incomprehensible
...

604
01:31:47,424 --> 01:31:50,385
and so the Earth was destroyed.

605
01:31:52,346 --> 01:31:55,641
We did not understand the message.

606
01:32:00,854 --> 01:32:02,773
And now...

607
01:32:04,733 --> 01:32:07,069
am the only one left.

608
01:32:10,197 --> 01:32:14,243
I'm the only one who has some idea how to stop
...

609
01:32:15,619 --> 01:32:18,163
how to keep safe.

610
01:32:49,486 --> 01:32:51,321
Allison?

611
01:32:53,115 --> 01:32:54,867
Caleb?

612
01:32:54,908 --> 01:32:56,577
Kyle?

613
01:35:29,521 --> 01:35:32,941
<i>Will you do what you have to do?

614
01:36:04,056 --> 01:36:06,642
What you have to do...

615
01:37:07,744 --> 01:37:11,165
<i>James, you know
what you have to do.

616
01:37:22,342 --> 01:37:25,304
My family still alive?

617
01:37:26,346 --> 01:37:28,640
<i>Try and stay calm.

618
01:37:28,682 --> 01:37:31,935
No, I can not,
want to talk to them.

619
01:37:33,187 --> 01:37:35,272
<i>You know that's not possible.

620
01:37:35,314 --> 01:37:36,690
Why not?

621
01:37:36,732 --> 01:37:38,650
<i>Try to remember.

622
01:37:38,692 --> 01:37:40,569
Tell me why!

623
01:37:42,488 --> 01:37:44,740
<i>Because you killed.

624
01:37:51,663 --> 01:37:53,582
No, it can not be.

625
01:37:54,500 --> 01:37:58,545
It can not be, it is impossible...

626
01:37:59,213 --> 01:38:00,923
<i>Try to remember.

627
01:38:00,958 --> 01:38:02,716
No!

628
01:38:03,008 --> 01:38:06,720
<i>She would not allow their children
believe in you.

629
01:38:06,762 --> 01:38:08,514
No, enough.

630
01:38:08,806 --> 01:38:13,519
<i>I was leaving, James,
and your children get along with her.

631
01:38:16,313 --> 01:38:18,607
This is not happening...

632
01:38:18,649 --> 01:38:23,278
's all in my head, it's not real,
is all in my head.

633
01:38:25,489 --> 01:38:29,076
<i>killed, James,
remember?

634
01:38:29,618 --> 01:38:31,995
<i>You killed your family.

635
01:38:40,462 --> 01:38:42,339
Allison?

636
01:38:42,881 --> 01:38:45,175
Caleb?
Kyle?

637
01:41:00,102 --> 01:41:01,687
<i>James.

638
01:41:09,153 --> 01:41:10,779
<i>James.

639
01:41:16,618 --> 01:41:18,245
<i>James...

<i>opens the hatch.

641
01:41:31,008 --> 01:41:33,093
Allison...

642
01:42:41,620 --> 01:42:43,455
Okay.

643
01:42:44,706 --> 01:42:47,918
All is well.

644
01:42:56,468 --> 01:42:58,428
Remember...

645
01:42:58,512 --> 01:43:01,557
some of his nervous breakdown?

646
01:43:05,936 --> 01:43:09,898
Remember that his wife brought him here after...

647
01:43:10,440 --> 01:43:12,276
accident?

648
01:43:14,486 --> 01:43:16,613
Anyway, do not worry.

649
01:43:16,780 --> 01:43:20,200
Is now here and look after you.

650
01:43:24,955 --> 01:43:27,749
Do not you see, doctor...

651
01:43:28,834 --> 01:43:30,627
this room...

652
01:43:30,669 --> 01:43:33,338
this place...

653
01:43:35,632 --> 01:43:38,969
is just another one of your games?

654
01:43:39,720 --> 01:43:43,056
Human Usan as we used guinea pigs.

655
01:43:45,976 --> 01:43:49,438
Want to see how many times can destroy us.

656
01:43:51,023 --> 01:43:55,777
And it's not just out of curiosity.

657
01:43:57,863 --> 01:44:00,282
They do it for fun.

658
01:44:02,659 --> 01:44:05,287
They laugh now...

659
01:44:05,746 --> 01:44:09,124
watching me talk to someone that does not even exist.

660
01:44:14,755 --> 01:44:16,924
Not that it matters much.

661
01:44:22,012 --> 01:44:24,139
All dead.

662
01:44:27,559 --> 01:44:29,853
'm The last man.

663
01:44:31,855 --> 01:44:33,982
And I'm alone.

664
01:44:40,989 --> 01:44:42,825
Doctor...

665
01:44:47,579 --> 01:44:49,414
hear that?

666
01:44:51,291 --> 01:44:53,252
They laugh at us.

667
01:44:55,921 --> 01:44:57,714
They laugh.

668
01:45:08,016 --> 01:45:10,561
Dr. Stenson, telephone.

669
01:45:12,437 --> 01:45:14,523
Right back.

670
01:45:18,193 --> 01:45:20,070
They laugh!

671
01:45:21,405 --> 01:45:23,824
<i>Subtitles by Ealastor.

672
01:46:30,891 --> 01:46:36,104
I told him what you think happened,
guess I believed completely.

673
01:46:36,605 --> 01:46:38,524
Yes No...

674
01:48:14,203 --> 01:48:16,079
