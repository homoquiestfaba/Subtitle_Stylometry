1
00:00:44,005 --> 00:00:46,280
For more than 200 years...

2
00:00:46,725 --> 00:00:48,795
...we Owens women
have been blamed...

3
00:00:49,045 --> 00:00:52,355
...for everything that has
ever gone wrong in this town.

4
00:00:52,605 --> 00:00:55,199
Is that why people hate us
so much, Aunt Frances?

5
00:00:55,445 --> 00:00:59,882
They don 't hate us, sweetheart.
We just make them a little nervous.

6
00:01:00,125 --> 00:01:03,879
Let's face it, Jet. We Owens women
have always created a stir.

7
00:01:04,765 --> 00:01:08,201
It all began with
your ancestor, Maria.

8
00:01:08,445 --> 00:01:11,403
She was a witch.
The first in our family.

9
00:01:11,805 --> 00:01:13,796
And you, my darlings,
are the most recent...

10
00:01:14,045 --> 00:01:16,161
...in a long and distinguished line.

11
00:01:16,405 --> 00:01:20,080
Is that why they wanted to hang her?
Because she was a witch?

12
00:01:20,325 --> 00:01:24,238
The fact that our Aunt Maria was
a bit of a heartbreaker didn't help.

13
00:01:24,485 --> 00:01:26,282
Nor did it help that
most of her lovers...

14
00:01:26,525 --> 00:01:28,959
...had wives on the hanging committee.

15
00:01:29,365 --> 00:01:33,722
But no, I don 't think it was
either of those reasons.

16
00:01:33,965 --> 00:01:37,162
They feared her
because she had a gift.

17
00:01:37,965 --> 00:01:41,958
A power that has been passed
on to you children.

18
00:01:42,765 --> 00:01:44,517
She had the gift...

19
00:01:44,765 --> 00:01:46,198
...of magic.

20
00:01:59,765 --> 00:02:01,721
And it was this very gift...

21
00:02:02,045 --> 00:02:03,398
...that saved her life.

22
00:02:19,805 --> 00:02:22,638
She was banished
to this very island.

23
00:02:23,645 --> 00:02:26,603
With her unborn child
growing inside her belly...

24
00:02:26,845 --> 00:02:28,676
...she waited for her lover
to rescue her.

25
00:02:29,685 --> 00:02:31,357
But he never came.

26
00:02:32,405 --> 00:02:33,884
No one came.

27
00:02:35,765 --> 00:02:37,323
In a moment of despair...

28
00:02:37,565 --> 00:02:40,125
...she cast a spell upon herself:

29
00:02:40,365 --> 00:02:41,639
She would never again...

30
00:02:41,885 --> 00:02:44,319
...feel the agony of love.

31
00:02:44,765 --> 00:02:46,562
But as her bitterness grew...

32
00:02:46,805 --> 00:02:49,319
...the spell turned into a curse.

33
00:02:49,565 --> 00:02:54,002
A curse on any man
who dared love an Owens woman.

34
00:02:58,005 --> 00:02:59,757
Is that why Daddy died?

35
00:03:00,005 --> 00:03:01,040
From the curse?

36
00:03:01,285 --> 00:03:03,003
Yes, my darling.

37
00:03:06,805 --> 00:03:08,397
Your mother knew.

38
00:03:09,365 --> 00:03:13,563
She heard the beetle ticking
for your father's death all day long.

39
00:03:13,805 --> 00:03:17,036
She knew that when you hear
the sound of the deathwatch beetle...

40
00:03:17,285 --> 00:03:20,004
...the man you love
is doomed to die.

41
00:03:24,605 --> 00:03:26,721
But that's how you came
to live with us.

42
00:03:26,965 --> 00:03:28,717
We tucked you into our lives then.

43
00:03:28,965 --> 00:03:32,116
We've raised you
the best way we know how.

44
00:03:32,365 --> 00:03:35,482
In this house, we have
chocolate cake for breakfast.

45
00:03:35,725 --> 00:03:39,161
We never bother with silly things
like bedtimes or brushing our teeth.

46
00:03:39,685 --> 00:03:41,562
But with the sweets...

47
00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:43,318
...comes the sour.

48
00:03:43,605 --> 00:03:46,563
So when you find yourself
the center of attention...

49
00:03:46,845 --> 00:03:47,800
You want to play?

50
00:03:48,245 --> 00:03:51,203
It's not that they hate you.
It's that, well...

51
00:03:51,845 --> 00:03:52,880
We're different.

52
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:54,478
You witch!

53
00:03:56,445 --> 00:03:59,482
Witch! Witch!
You're a bitch!

54
00:04:10,205 --> 00:04:11,354
Gillian.

55
00:04:11,645 --> 00:04:12,521
Sally.

56
00:04:13,805 --> 00:04:15,875
The only curse in this family...

57
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:18,559
...is sitting right there
at the end of the table.

58
00:04:18,805 --> 00:04:19,874
Your Aunt Fanny.

59
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:22,355
Come on, Jetty,
even you have to admit...

60
00:04:22,565 --> 00:04:24,635
...any man who gets involved
with an Owens woman...

61
00:04:24,885 --> 00:04:26,443
...is bound to end up
6 feet under.

62
00:04:26,765 --> 00:04:27,880
Spare me.

63
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:30,357
What about my poor Ethan?

64
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:31,361
An accident.

65
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:32,401
It was fate.

66
00:04:32,645 --> 00:04:33,475
It was an accident.

67
00:04:33,725 --> 00:04:34,635
It was fate.

68
00:04:34,965 --> 00:04:36,080
- Accident!
- Fate!

69
00:04:38,085 --> 00:04:40,599
Mommy died of a broken heart,
didn't she?

70
00:04:43,205 --> 00:04:45,639
Yes, my darling girl, she did.

71
00:04:51,045 --> 00:04:53,161
My little witch...

72
00:04:53,725 --> 00:04:55,875
...let's go inside
and do some spells.

73
00:04:56,285 --> 00:04:58,799
- What about my homework?
- Pish!

74
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:01,798
Tosh! You'll both learn things
in this house...

75
00:05:02,045 --> 00:05:03,683
...you'll never learn in school.

76
00:05:04,405 --> 00:05:05,474
Let's go.

77
00:05:06,405 --> 00:05:07,315
Come on, Gilly!

78
00:05:07,565 --> 00:05:09,157
I'm coming, Sally!

79
00:05:12,365 --> 00:05:14,515
Very good, Sally!

80
00:05:14,845 --> 00:05:17,313
You've been blessed with a gift.

81
00:05:17,605 --> 00:05:18,594
What about me?

82
00:05:18,845 --> 00:05:21,313
We don't worry about you, Gilly-Bean.

83
00:05:21,565 --> 00:05:23,999
Your talents will emerge in time.

84
00:05:29,445 --> 00:05:33,233
Sally, you just stay right there.
Keep working on your spells.

85
00:05:33,885 --> 00:05:36,160
Just keep working on your spells.

86
00:05:39,725 --> 00:05:40,714
Get the bird.

87
00:05:40,965 --> 00:05:42,159
Get the book.

88
00:05:44,525 --> 00:05:47,801
I want him so much,
I can't think about anything else.

89
00:05:48,045 --> 00:05:49,239
I don't sleep.

90
00:05:50,045 --> 00:05:52,798
He has to leave his wife.
He has to leave her now.

91
00:05:53,045 --> 00:05:55,240
Perhaps you might find
one better suited.

92
00:05:55,485 --> 00:05:58,682
I don't want anyone else.
He's all I think about.

93
00:05:58,965 --> 00:06:00,523
Why else would I come here?

94
00:06:00,765 --> 00:06:02,562
Take the money, Jet.

95
00:06:11,725 --> 00:06:14,080
I want him to want me so much
he can't stand it.

96
00:06:22,005 --> 00:06:24,280
Be careful what you wish for.

97
00:06:30,485 --> 00:06:32,999
I hope I never fall in love.
I hope I never fall in love.

98
00:06:33,245 --> 00:06:36,317
I hope I never fall in love.
I hope I never fall in love.

99
00:06:36,565 --> 00:06:38,840
I can't wait to fall in love.

100
00:06:39,485 --> 00:06:42,045
He will hear my call a mile away.

101
00:06:43,165 --> 00:06:45,235
He will whistle my favorite song.

102
00:06:46,805 --> 00:06:48,477
He can ride a pony backwards.

103
00:06:48,725 --> 00:06:49,441
What are you doing?

104
00:06:49,685 --> 00:06:51,721
Summoning up a true love spell...

105
00:06:51,965 --> 00:06:53,318
...called Amas Veritas.

106
00:06:54,005 --> 00:06:56,565
He can flip pancakes in the air.

107
00:06:59,325 --> 00:07:01,680
He'll be marvelously kind.

108
00:07:02,805 --> 00:07:04,761
And his favorite shape...

109
00:07:05,245 --> 00:07:06,473
...will be a star.

110
00:07:12,885 --> 00:07:14,364
And he'll have...

111
00:07:14,805 --> 00:07:16,363
...one green eye...

112
00:07:21,005 --> 00:07:22,484
...and one blue.

113
00:07:28,525 --> 00:07:30,993
Thought you never wanted
to fall in love.

114
00:07:31,765 --> 00:07:33,278
That's the point.

115
00:07:33,525 --> 00:07:35,959
The guy I dreamed of doesn't exist.

116
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:40,084
And if he doesn't exist,
I'll never die of a broken heart.

117
00:08:07,245 --> 00:08:09,076
And if he doesn't exist...

118
00:08:09,325 --> 00:08:11,555
...I'll never die of a broken heart.

119
00:08:15,165 --> 00:08:16,359
Get the door!

120
00:08:24,565 --> 00:08:26,396
Sal, you have...

121
00:08:26,645 --> 00:08:28,237
...no idea!

122
00:08:29,365 --> 00:08:31,959
Do you love him enough
to marry him?

123
00:08:32,205 --> 00:08:33,877
Come on, Sal, what's enough?

124
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:35,524
I hate it here.

125
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:38,563
I want to go where no one's
even heard of us.

126
00:08:38,805 --> 00:08:40,557
I feel like I'll never
see you again.

127
00:08:40,805 --> 00:08:41,874
Of course you will.

128
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:43,524
We'll grow old together.

129
00:08:43,765 --> 00:08:46,279
It'll be you and me
living in a big house.

130
00:08:46,525 --> 00:08:48,959
These two old biddies
with all these cats.

131
00:08:49,245 --> 00:08:51,554
I bet we even die on the same day.

132
00:08:51,885 --> 00:08:53,079
You swear?

133
00:08:55,005 --> 00:08:55,596
Honey...

134
00:08:55,845 --> 00:08:57,563
...I need your pocketknife.

135
00:09:01,485 --> 00:09:02,235
Here.

136
00:09:04,925 --> 00:09:06,074
My blood.

137
00:09:07,805 --> 00:09:09,318
Your blood.

138
00:09:13,165 --> 00:09:14,393
Our blood.

139
00:09:19,445 --> 00:09:20,719
I love you, Gilly-Bean.

140
00:09:22,445 --> 00:09:24,037
I love you too.

141
00:09:36,005 --> 00:09:38,678
- Good morning.
- Hello, boys.

142
00:09:39,165 --> 00:09:40,518
Charlie, looking good!

143
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:43,638
God, what was I thinking?

144
00:09:43,885 --> 00:09:45,318
Franny, let it go.

145
00:09:45,565 --> 00:09:48,796
My goodness, Gillian's in Orlando!
She's in Orlando.

146
00:09:49,045 --> 00:09:50,956
I guess that
Roto-Rooter man is history.

147
00:09:51,165 --> 00:09:52,962
- According to that, he is.
- It's insane.

148
00:09:53,205 --> 00:09:55,435
She keeps going through
all these guys.

149
00:09:55,685 --> 00:09:59,075
Hopefully, someday she'll find
a guy who'll go through her.

150
00:10:01,565 --> 00:10:03,237
Hello, darling. How are you?

151
00:10:03,445 --> 00:10:05,197
Oh, Jet, just give it up.

152
00:10:05,445 --> 00:10:06,355
Never.

153
00:10:06,605 --> 00:10:07,594
God, I miss her.

154
00:10:07,845 --> 00:10:09,642
Oh, sweetie!

155
00:10:11,165 --> 00:10:12,359
Oh, dear!

156
00:10:17,005 --> 00:10:19,963
Oh, Samson!
Now just knock it off.

157
00:10:20,605 --> 00:10:22,243
All I want is a normal life.

158
00:10:22,485 --> 00:10:24,237
Darling, when will you understand...

159
00:10:24,485 --> 00:10:27,079
...that being normal
is not necessarily a virtue.

160
00:10:27,325 --> 00:10:28,724
It denotes a lack of courage.

161
00:10:28,965 --> 00:10:29,841
It's what I want.

162
00:10:30,085 --> 00:10:33,202
See this couple? He's having an
affair with the babysitter.

163
00:10:33,445 --> 00:10:36,084
And she can eat a pound cake
in under a minute.

164
00:10:47,005 --> 00:10:48,154
Sorry!

165
00:11:02,365 --> 00:11:03,320
What time is it?

166
00:11:03,565 --> 00:11:04,520
Any moment now.

167
00:11:23,885 --> 00:11:25,398
Where are you going, dear?

168
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,437
Most excellent.

169
00:11:59,645 --> 00:12:00,919
Dear Gillian:

170
00:12:01,165 --> 00:12:03,281
Today is our
third anniversary...

171
00:12:03,645 --> 00:12:06,796
...and all I have to show for it
are two beautiful little girls...

172
00:12:07,045 --> 00:12:10,401
...and a husband
I just can 't stop kissing.

173
00:12:11,165 --> 00:12:13,679
I don 't even mind the beard.

174
00:12:14,205 --> 00:12:15,763
I wish you could see us.

175
00:12:16,605 --> 00:12:20,154
No more stones being thrown,
no taunts cried out.

176
00:12:20,965 --> 00:12:24,116
Everything is just so blissfully...

177
00:12:24,445 --> 00:12:25,560
...normal.

178
00:12:26,525 --> 00:12:28,436
Life is perfect.

179
00:12:31,645 --> 00:12:33,203
Dear Sal:

180
00:12:35,365 --> 00:12:37,435
I'm lying in the sun.

181
00:12:39,045 --> 00:12:41,115
I'm hanging by the pool.

182
00:12:41,565 --> 00:12:43,681
I've got a million friends.

183
00:12:44,525 --> 00:12:45,924
You might say...

184
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:47,917
...that life is...

185
00:12:48,165 --> 00:12:49,393
...perfect.

186
00:12:55,285 --> 00:12:57,321
But I don 't care
about any of it.

187
00:12:57,565 --> 00:13:00,284
In fact, I only have
two words to say to you:

188
00:13:02,205 --> 00:13:03,718
Jimmy Angelov.

189
00:13:04,765 --> 00:13:06,244
Jimmy...

190
00:13:06,605 --> 00:13:07,799
...Angelov.

191
00:13:56,365 --> 00:13:57,320
Angel.

192
00:13:57,565 --> 00:13:59,601
Angelov, Angelov.

193
00:14:41,285 --> 00:14:42,877
Where are you?

194
00:14:43,165 --> 00:14:44,757
Don't do this to me.

195
00:14:45,605 --> 00:14:47,323
Come on! Come on!

196
00:14:47,565 --> 00:14:50,125
- Hey, boys, catch anything today?
- Not much.

197
00:14:50,365 --> 00:14:51,161
See you in a bit.

198
00:14:57,245 --> 00:14:58,644
Jimmy, what's going on?

199
00:14:58,925 --> 00:14:59,960
I hear you.

200
00:15:01,205 --> 00:15:02,399
I hear you.

201
00:15:02,645 --> 00:15:03,600
Don't!

202
00:15:04,245 --> 00:15:05,075
How's Mary doing?

203
00:15:05,325 --> 00:15:06,121
She's good?

204
00:15:11,965 --> 00:15:13,444
That can't be. No!

205
00:15:18,245 --> 00:15:19,564
What's that?

206
00:15:20,485 --> 00:15:21,964
I know you're in there.

207
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:25,841
Michael, look out!

208
00:15:27,005 --> 00:15:28,597
Look out behind you!

209
00:15:29,485 --> 00:15:30,520
On your right!

210
00:16:10,445 --> 00:16:12,675
It was the curse, wasn't it?

211
00:16:13,485 --> 00:16:16,397
He died because
I loved him so much!

212
00:16:16,645 --> 00:16:18,078
My poor little girl.

213
00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:28,041
We had no idea...

214
00:16:28,285 --> 00:16:29,877
...when we cast the spell...

215
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:32,355
What spell?
What are you talking about?

216
00:16:36,445 --> 00:16:37,719
You didn't!

217
00:16:38,765 --> 00:16:40,278
Please tell me...

218
00:16:40,565 --> 00:16:42,203
...that my own flesh and blood...

219
00:16:42,525 --> 00:16:44,561
It was just a little push.

220
00:16:44,805 --> 00:16:46,523
You wanted so much to be happy.

221
00:16:46,805 --> 00:16:49,114
We never expected
that you'd truly love him.

222
00:16:49,365 --> 00:16:50,844
Well, I did.

223
00:16:51,085 --> 00:16:52,484
And I want him back.

224
00:16:57,845 --> 00:16:59,995
You brought him into my life.
You bring him back!

225
00:17:00,245 --> 00:17:02,998
Bring him back!
I've never asked you for anything!

226
00:17:03,245 --> 00:17:06,043
I never asked for spells, but do
this! You can bring him back.

227
00:17:06,285 --> 00:17:07,354
No, dear.

228
00:17:07,645 --> 00:17:08,555
We won't do that.

229
00:17:08,805 --> 00:17:09,840
We don't do that.

230
00:17:10,085 --> 00:17:12,360
You can do this.
I know you can. I remember.

231
00:17:12,565 --> 00:17:14,601
I found it here when Mommy
and Daddy died.

232
00:17:15,445 --> 00:17:18,243
Even if we did bring him back,
it wouldn't be Michael.

233
00:17:18,525 --> 00:17:20,595
It'd be something else.
Something dark...

234
00:17:21,285 --> 00:17:22,240
...and unnatural.

235
00:17:22,485 --> 00:17:26,558
I don't care what he comes back as.
As long as he comes back.

236
00:17:26,805 --> 00:17:29,524
Please do this for me.
Please!

237
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:34,353
Please!

238
00:17:43,845 --> 00:17:46,313
This is only temporary.
Don't get too comfortable.

239
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:47,839
No chocolate for breakfast.

240
00:17:48,085 --> 00:17:50,121
Homework will be done
after dinner.

241
00:17:50,405 --> 00:17:52,316
Teeth and hair brushed
before bed.

242
00:17:54,845 --> 00:17:56,597
And as for you two...

243
00:17:56,845 --> 00:17:59,279
...my children will never do magic.

244
00:17:59,605 --> 00:18:00,754
Ever.

245
00:18:16,205 --> 00:18:17,433
Mom?

246
00:18:20,445 --> 00:18:22,356
It's time for us to go to school.

247
00:18:23,725 --> 00:18:25,124
Mommy.

248
00:18:27,885 --> 00:18:29,603
It's the same time
as yesterday...

249
00:18:29,845 --> 00:18:32,882
...and the day before that,
and the day before that.

250
00:18:35,445 --> 00:18:36,958
Out of bed, sleepyhead!

251
00:18:38,645 --> 00:18:40,522
I'm worried about Antonia.

252
00:18:41,205 --> 00:18:42,081
Do you know...

253
00:18:42,325 --> 00:18:45,954
...she puts on her mouse ears,
she drives around town all liquored up.

254
00:18:46,405 --> 00:18:47,520
Naked!

255
00:18:53,565 --> 00:18:54,475
All right...

256
00:18:54,725 --> 00:18:56,363
...I'll see you around.

257
00:18:57,405 --> 00:18:58,838
Come here, you!

258
00:19:02,565 --> 00:19:05,125
I'm sorry, baby.
I'm just so...

259
00:19:05,565 --> 00:19:06,839
...tired.

260
00:19:08,205 --> 00:19:09,718
It's okay, Mommy.

261
00:19:28,605 --> 00:19:29,958
Gilly.

262
00:19:34,245 --> 00:19:35,280
Sally.

263
00:19:46,725 --> 00:19:48,761
I was just thinking about you.

264
00:19:49,405 --> 00:19:51,635
You're always thinking about me.

265
00:20:06,845 --> 00:20:09,757
Honey, I just have to go
to the bathroom.

266
00:20:14,525 --> 00:20:15,924
Let's go together.

267
00:20:16,165 --> 00:20:17,883
Jimmy, come on.

268
00:20:18,405 --> 00:20:19,838
I'm just kidding.

269
00:20:20,485 --> 00:20:21,600
Go.

270
00:20:55,085 --> 00:20:58,043
You're in my blood like holy wine

271
00:20:58,725 --> 00:21:01,558
You taste so bitter and so sweet

272
00:21:03,205 --> 00:21:05,673
I could drink a case of you

273
00:21:11,205 --> 00:21:13,435
Still I'd be on my feet

274
00:21:44,205 --> 00:21:46,639
I was really, really happy.

275
00:21:56,085 --> 00:21:58,360
We were going to open
a botanical shop.

276
00:21:58,605 --> 00:22:00,960
He'd get the ingredients,
and I'd make the stuff.

277
00:22:01,205 --> 00:22:04,595
He really loved my
mint-oatmeal shaving cream.

278
00:22:04,845 --> 00:22:06,597
He couldn't stop eating it.

279
00:22:07,205 --> 00:22:10,117
I'm sure all this is really
boring to you...

280
00:22:11,085 --> 00:22:12,313
...but he made me laugh.

281
00:22:12,525 --> 00:22:13,958
What kind of name is Angelov?

282
00:22:14,205 --> 00:22:15,718
Bulgarian.

283
00:22:17,205 --> 00:22:18,957
Bulgarian?

284
00:22:20,845 --> 00:22:24,076
He's from somewhere
near Transylvania.

285
00:22:26,085 --> 00:22:27,643
He has this whole...

286
00:22:27,885 --> 00:22:31,082
...Dracula-cowboy thing about him.

287
00:22:32,445 --> 00:22:35,118
He's just so intense.
I mean...

288
00:22:36,205 --> 00:22:39,675
...he talks about our relationship
in terms of centuries.

289
00:22:39,965 --> 00:22:42,240
Sometimes we just stay up all night...

290
00:22:42,485 --> 00:22:44,396
...worshipping each other...

291
00:22:45,205 --> 00:22:46,877
...like bats.

292
00:22:49,605 --> 00:22:52,642
Thank God for Jet's belladonna...

293
00:22:53,325 --> 00:22:55,077
...or I'd never get any sleep.

294
00:22:55,445 --> 00:22:57,003
Why are you taking
that stuff?

295
00:22:57,285 --> 00:23:00,880
I'm not using it. I just give
it to him every now and then.

296
00:23:01,525 --> 00:23:05,404
So you're drugging your boyfriend
to get a little shuteye?

297
00:23:07,965 --> 00:23:09,683
Doesn't that seem
strange to you?

298
00:23:10,085 --> 00:23:11,074
Maybe.

299
00:23:11,965 --> 00:23:13,444
And he's strong.

300
00:23:14,645 --> 00:23:16,636
So much stronger than me.

301
00:23:17,045 --> 00:23:19,320
He can survive the curse.

302
00:23:28,445 --> 00:23:30,561
Do you forgive our mother?

303
00:23:32,565 --> 00:23:34,044
Sometimes.

304
00:23:36,725 --> 00:23:38,955
You'll never forgive yourself...

305
00:23:39,285 --> 00:23:40,479
...unless you get up...

306
00:23:40,725 --> 00:23:42,761
...and you get dressed...

307
00:23:43,285 --> 00:23:46,357
...and brush your goddamn teeth,
because your breath stinks...

308
00:23:49,685 --> 00:23:52,324
...and you take care of
those little girls.

309
00:23:52,645 --> 00:23:54,317
Yeah, you're right.

310
00:24:07,485 --> 00:24:09,077
I love you.

311
00:24:11,525 --> 00:24:13,834
I love you too, Gilly-Bean.

312
00:24:56,205 --> 00:24:58,116
Opening Soon

313
00:25:29,565 --> 00:25:32,318
How's your wicked mommy doing?

314
00:25:32,565 --> 00:25:34,840
Witch! Witch! You're a witch!

315
00:25:37,045 --> 00:25:39,764
You'd think after 300 years,
they'd make up a better rhyme.

316
00:25:43,965 --> 00:25:45,444
Your troublemaker
started this.

317
00:25:45,685 --> 00:25:47,482
- I hate you!
- Put the finger down, Kylie.

318
00:25:47,725 --> 00:25:48,840
I hope you get...

319
00:25:50,965 --> 00:25:51,875
...chickenpox!

320
00:25:55,965 --> 00:25:57,000
She was just kidding.

321
00:25:57,405 --> 00:25:59,123
No, she wasn't, Mom.

322
00:25:59,605 --> 00:26:01,596
She was not kidding.

323
00:26:01,845 --> 00:26:03,597
What's wrong with you?
We do not cast.

324
00:26:03,845 --> 00:26:06,757
We do not toy with people's lives.
This is not a game.

325
00:26:07,005 --> 00:26:10,156
No, you don't cast! You probably
couldn't even if you tried!

326
00:26:13,165 --> 00:26:15,474
She has all this power
and doesn't use it!

327
00:26:15,885 --> 00:26:18,240
I think you really hurt
Mom's feelings.

328
00:26:19,525 --> 00:26:22,358
Kylie thinks any man who
marries us is going to croak.

329
00:26:22,645 --> 00:26:24,476
That's such hogwash.

330
00:26:24,725 --> 00:26:27,683
What about your grandparents,
Jack and Regina?

331
00:26:28,005 --> 00:26:32,044
Grandma Regina died
of a broken heart, didn't she?

332
00:26:33,125 --> 00:26:35,036
How could she do that?

333
00:26:35,605 --> 00:26:38,403
Leave Mom and Aunt Gilly behind
when they were little?

334
00:26:38,685 --> 00:26:39,959
Why won't she talk about it?

335
00:26:40,205 --> 00:26:43,800
Was Mama good at spells as a girl?
Why won't she do spells now?

336
00:26:44,045 --> 00:26:45,114
What's going on here?

337
00:26:45,565 --> 00:26:46,315
Nothing.

338
00:26:46,565 --> 00:26:48,601
Just making toast, is all.

339
00:26:52,805 --> 00:26:53,920
Finish your homework?

340
00:26:55,285 --> 00:26:57,753
A storm's coming.
Go check the windows for me.

341
00:27:05,525 --> 00:27:06,480
Making toast?

342
00:27:09,605 --> 00:27:12,278
I want you to watch
what you say to those girls.

343
00:27:12,525 --> 00:27:15,437
I don't want you filling
their heads with your nonsense.

344
00:27:16,045 --> 00:27:17,842
We'd never tell them nonsense.

345
00:27:20,565 --> 00:27:22,203
Good night, sweetie.

346
00:27:25,605 --> 00:27:27,084
Dearest Gilly:

347
00:27:29,685 --> 00:27:32,119
Sometimes I feel
there's a hole inside of me...

348
00:27:34,165 --> 00:27:36,201
...an emptiness that
at times...

349
00:27:36,445 --> 00:27:38,163
...seems to burn.

350
00:27:39,285 --> 00:27:43,642
I think if you lifted my heart
to your ear, you could hear the ocean.

351
00:27:45,125 --> 00:27:47,764
And the moon tonight,
there's a circle around it.

352
00:27:48,005 --> 00:27:50,394
A sign of trouble
not far behind.

353
00:27:50,925 --> 00:27:53,280
I have this dream of being whole.

354
00:27:53,725 --> 00:27:56,523
Of not going to sleep
each night wanting.

355
00:27:57,125 --> 00:28:01,596
But still, sometimes when the wind
is warm or the crickets sing...

356
00:28:02,085 --> 00:28:06,317
...I dream of a love that even time
will lie down and be still for.

357
00:28:07,725 --> 00:28:09,875
I just want someone
to love me.

358
00:28:10,365 --> 00:28:12,083
I want to be seen.

359
00:28:16,845 --> 00:28:20,235
I don 't know.
Maybe I've had my happiness.

360
00:28:22,325 --> 00:28:24,202
I don 't want to believe it...

361
00:28:25,445 --> 00:28:27,436
...but there is no man, Gilly.

362
00:28:28,925 --> 00:28:30,278
Only that moon.

363
00:28:39,405 --> 00:28:40,633
Gillian!

364
00:28:44,085 --> 00:28:44,961
- It's Gillian.
- I know.

365
00:28:45,205 --> 00:28:46,115
What's wrong?

366
00:28:46,365 --> 00:28:49,038
I'm scared.
Can you come and get me?

367
00:28:49,285 --> 00:28:50,320
Where are you?

368
00:28:50,685 --> 00:28:53,153
I'm taking the first flight out.
Watch the kids.

369
00:28:53,885 --> 00:28:56,274
Just go to Gilly.
The children'll be fine.

370
00:28:56,525 --> 00:28:58,595
We'll take them to
the solstice celebration.

371
00:28:58,845 --> 00:29:00,722
Why can't you two
just stay here?

372
00:29:01,125 --> 00:29:03,480
We can't back out.
We're on the committee.

373
00:29:03,725 --> 00:29:04,601
We're presenting.

374
00:29:05,045 --> 00:29:07,240
I don't want them dancing naked
under the moon.

375
00:29:07,485 --> 00:29:08,884
No, of course not, dear.

376
00:29:09,125 --> 00:29:12,435
Nudity is entirely optional,
as you well remember!

377
00:29:18,885 --> 00:29:20,113
Hello!

378
00:29:44,925 --> 00:29:46,483
Gilly, I'm here.

379
00:29:47,365 --> 00:29:48,275
Thanks, Sal.

380
00:29:48,525 --> 00:29:49,401
Hi.

381
00:29:51,405 --> 00:29:53,600
The room service here sucks.

382
00:29:55,085 --> 00:29:56,598
Let's get you out of here.

383
00:29:57,525 --> 00:29:58,435
I'm fine.

384
00:30:05,165 --> 00:30:06,803
He's been really crazy.

385
00:30:07,045 --> 00:30:09,559
We've been driving
for two weeks straight.

386
00:30:09,805 --> 00:30:13,115
Not even straight.
In these zigzags, back and forth.

387
00:30:13,565 --> 00:30:15,317
Damn these shoes!

388
00:30:15,565 --> 00:30:18,602
Then today he says
he wants a jelly doughnut.

389
00:30:18,845 --> 00:30:21,837
And he says to the kid,
"Jelly doughnut, with cream. "

390
00:30:22,085 --> 00:30:23,882
And the kid looked confused.

391
00:30:24,125 --> 00:30:26,241
And I said,
"Jimmy, jelly's not a cream. "

392
00:30:26,485 --> 00:30:29,443
Then the kid laughed and I laughed
and then he punched me.

393
00:30:29,725 --> 00:30:32,159
He punched me real hard.
The bastard!

394
00:30:33,325 --> 00:30:34,917
Blood on the moon.

395
00:30:35,645 --> 00:30:37,795
- I know.
- Blood on the moon.

396
00:30:38,045 --> 00:30:39,398
I know. Get in the car.

397
00:30:39,645 --> 00:30:41,954
Where's my tiger's eye?
It brings me luck.

398
00:30:42,205 --> 00:30:43,604
- Is it in here?
- I left it.

399
00:30:43,845 --> 00:30:46,200
- I need my tiger's eye!
- It's probably in the bag!

400
00:30:48,165 --> 00:30:49,564
Gillian, come on!

401
00:31:01,565 --> 00:31:02,884
Honey, just forget...

402
00:31:04,205 --> 00:31:05,194
You drive.

403
00:31:16,605 --> 00:31:17,754
You want some?

404
00:31:19,365 --> 00:31:20,195
Nope?

405
00:31:29,085 --> 00:31:30,404
You ever read any books...

406
00:31:30,645 --> 00:31:32,158
...by Louis L'Amour?

407
00:31:36,845 --> 00:31:38,676
Louis L'Amour...

408
00:31:38,965 --> 00:31:40,478
...was a foreigner...

409
00:31:41,045 --> 00:31:43,320
...and he loved all things cowboy.

410
00:31:44,285 --> 00:31:45,843
Just like me, Jimmy-Boy.

411
00:31:48,805 --> 00:31:51,717
Louis would write
stories about rustlers.

412
00:31:51,965 --> 00:31:53,080
Rustlers...

413
00:31:53,485 --> 00:31:55,476
...who were really bad guys.

414
00:31:55,725 --> 00:31:58,159
The belladonna is in my bag.

415
00:31:59,685 --> 00:32:02,279
They would try to steal the cattle.

416
00:32:03,405 --> 00:32:05,396
But before they could sell them...

417
00:32:06,085 --> 00:32:10,124
...they would try to take away
the brand of the owner with an acid...

418
00:32:10,525 --> 00:32:11,799
...or by...

419
00:32:12,445 --> 00:32:13,594
...scrubbing.

420
00:32:14,085 --> 00:32:16,883
Unfortunately, they could
never get rid of it.

421
00:32:17,125 --> 00:32:19,400
So they would be caught
and get hanged.

422
00:32:19,645 --> 00:32:20,714
What are you doing?

423
00:32:21,085 --> 00:32:22,074
Come on.

424
00:32:22,365 --> 00:32:24,401
You can't hide the brand.

425
00:32:24,685 --> 00:32:25,834
It's just you and me.

426
00:32:27,805 --> 00:32:28,715
Watch the road!

427
00:32:28,965 --> 00:32:29,636
Shut up!

428
00:32:29,885 --> 00:32:33,764
Rustlers and branding!
Louis L'Amour! Who is not a foreigner!

429
00:32:34,005 --> 00:32:36,473
He's from North Dakota,
you asshole!

430
00:32:36,725 --> 00:32:39,364
- Watch the road!
- You're freaking me out, Dracula freak!

431
00:32:39,605 --> 00:32:42,119
Give me the bottle
before I plow you into a truck...

432
00:32:42,365 --> 00:32:44,560
...just to get you to shut up!

433
00:32:44,805 --> 00:32:46,124
Calm down!

434
00:32:51,045 --> 00:32:51,875
You know, girls...

435
00:32:55,205 --> 00:32:58,322
...I am feeling very into
sisters right now.

436
00:33:04,525 --> 00:33:06,880
You were always on my mind

437
00:33:09,245 --> 00:33:11,634
You were always on my mind

438
00:33:14,845 --> 00:33:16,961
He should've passed out by now.

439
00:33:17,325 --> 00:33:20,078
- You didn't give him enough.
- I gave him plenty.

440
00:33:35,325 --> 00:33:36,724
What's he going to do?

441
00:33:36,965 --> 00:33:38,239
Just stay calm.

442
00:33:42,525 --> 00:33:44,436
If I made you feel

443
00:33:45,125 --> 00:33:46,444
Second best

444
00:33:47,005 --> 00:33:47,881
I'm so sorry

445
00:33:48,285 --> 00:33:49,798
I was blind

446
00:33:50,845 --> 00:33:52,961
You were always on my mind

447
00:33:54,845 --> 00:33:56,517
Jimmy, please, baby.

448
00:33:56,765 --> 00:33:57,880
Come on.

449
00:33:58,445 --> 00:34:01,278
- Come on, baby, I love you.
- I'm so sorry, my love.

450
00:34:01,565 --> 00:34:03,123
I want to be with you forever.

451
00:34:03,365 --> 00:34:04,844
Jimmy, please.

452
00:34:22,925 --> 00:34:24,244
He's out.
He's passed out.

453
00:34:24,525 --> 00:34:25,480
Oh, God!

454
00:34:27,165 --> 00:34:28,359
Oh, my God!

455
00:34:29,645 --> 00:34:31,078
How much did you give him?

456
00:34:31,365 --> 00:34:34,562
I wasn't using a measuring cup!
He tried to kill you!

457
00:34:35,365 --> 00:34:36,434
Come on!

458
00:34:42,765 --> 00:34:46,314
Please, God, if you get us out of this,
I'll be good. I'll have babies.

459
00:34:46,565 --> 00:34:48,715
I have babies, Gillian.

460
00:34:48,965 --> 00:34:50,318
I had normal.

461
00:34:50,565 --> 00:34:52,715
I worked really hard
to get that normal.

462
00:34:52,965 --> 00:34:56,355
It's all my fault, Sally.
I didn't mean to ruin your life.

463
00:34:56,605 --> 00:34:58,277
I just had no one else
to turn to.

464
00:34:58,685 --> 00:34:59,913
Get in the car.

465
00:35:01,165 --> 00:35:03,042
Get in the car.

466
00:35:09,285 --> 00:35:11,640
We have to go to the police.
It was self-defense.

467
00:35:12,845 --> 00:35:15,803
The old slowly-poison-him-to-death
self-defense?

468
00:35:16,085 --> 00:35:19,122
Come on, Sally,
they're never going to believe us.

469
00:35:20,405 --> 00:35:22,202
You should stop smoking so much.

470
00:35:23,045 --> 00:35:23,921
Why?

471
00:35:24,365 --> 00:35:25,923
I'll probably get life.

472
00:35:26,165 --> 00:35:28,554
I should smoke two at once.
It'll shorten the sentence.

473
00:35:29,885 --> 00:35:32,353
I really don't want
to lose my children.

474
00:35:35,445 --> 00:35:36,355
I know.

475
00:35:37,485 --> 00:35:39,396
I don't want you to either.

476
00:35:54,085 --> 00:35:55,359
What are you thinking?

477
00:35:56,845 --> 00:36:00,076
When Michael died, you asked
the aunts to bring him back.

478
00:36:00,845 --> 00:36:01,834
But they wouldn't.

479
00:36:02,125 --> 00:36:04,241
Wouldn't, but not couldn't.

480
00:36:04,485 --> 00:36:08,080
They were right. He'd come back
as something dark and unnatural.

481
00:36:08,325 --> 00:36:11,522
Jimmy already is dark and unnatural.
I don't care what he comes back as.

482
00:36:11,765 --> 00:36:14,598
No, that is not an option.
That is not a choice.

483
00:36:14,845 --> 00:36:17,962
We don't have a choice!
This is our choice!

484
00:36:25,125 --> 00:36:26,160
You...

485
00:36:26,405 --> 00:36:27,474
...owe me...

486
00:36:27,965 --> 00:36:29,193
...bigtime.

487
00:36:35,485 --> 00:36:37,715
He's going to be so pissed.

488
00:36:43,165 --> 00:36:44,644
Okay, here we go.

489
00:36:53,365 --> 00:36:55,003
- Watch his balls.
- You watch them!

490
00:36:58,125 --> 00:36:59,444
Spell book.

491
00:37:10,445 --> 00:37:12,913
Okay, Jimmy,
I will get you out of this...

492
00:37:13,725 --> 00:37:16,956
...but when I do,
we are definitely breaking up.

493
00:37:17,205 --> 00:37:18,957
It is over.

494
00:37:20,645 --> 00:37:22,522
What are you doing?

495
00:37:23,405 --> 00:37:24,440
Nothing.

496
00:37:28,165 --> 00:37:29,518
Are you sure...

497
00:37:29,765 --> 00:37:31,357
...you want to do this?

498
00:37:34,525 --> 00:37:36,038
Absolutely.

499
00:37:45,565 --> 00:37:49,956
"Lips pursed, emit wind over tongue
in motion, teeth on edge. "

500
00:37:55,485 --> 00:37:56,634
Good enough, good enough.

501
00:37:56,885 --> 00:38:00,434
"Touch bounded smudge of blue sage
with braided wheat straw.

502
00:38:01,125 --> 00:38:04,037
Insert needles
through eyes of corpse. "

503
00:38:04,605 --> 00:38:06,402
- Through the eye?
- In the eye.

504
00:38:12,725 --> 00:38:13,475
No way!

505
00:38:13,725 --> 00:38:16,000
I think we should wait
for the aunts.

506
00:38:16,245 --> 00:38:18,236
It's not like
he's going to stay fresh.

507
00:38:18,485 --> 00:38:19,998
It's now or never.

508
00:38:20,565 --> 00:38:24,353
I need for you to get me something
white to write on top of the star.

509
00:38:24,605 --> 00:38:25,720
Chop-chop!

510
00:38:27,325 --> 00:38:29,077
This is all I could find.

511
00:38:29,405 --> 00:38:31,999
This is actually brilliant.
This is good.

512
00:38:32,845 --> 00:38:34,073
Now we're supposed to say:

513
00:38:34,965 --> 00:38:36,034
"Black as night...

514
00:38:36,285 --> 00:38:38,116
...erase death from our sight.

515
00:38:38,685 --> 00:38:39,879
White as light.

516
00:38:40,765 --> 00:38:42,357
Mighty Hectate make it right. "

517
00:38:42,965 --> 00:38:44,444
Black as night.

518
00:38:44,685 --> 00:38:45,720
White as light.

519
00:38:46,445 --> 00:38:48,959
White as light.
Mighty Hectate make it right.

520
00:38:49,645 --> 00:38:50,680
White as light.

521
00:38:51,645 --> 00:38:53,363
Black as night.

522
00:38:53,805 --> 00:38:55,636
Erase death from our sight.

523
00:38:56,485 --> 00:39:00,683
White as light.
Mighty Hectate make it right.

524
00:39:33,925 --> 00:39:35,517
I want you to be my wife!

525
00:39:36,165 --> 00:39:37,393
Can you promise me that?

526
00:39:38,165 --> 00:39:39,644
I want you to be my wife!

527
00:39:41,285 --> 00:39:42,957
I want you to be my wife!

528
00:40:16,405 --> 00:40:19,442
You have the worst taste in men.

529
00:40:26,085 --> 00:40:29,122
I know this sounds
really stupid right now...

530
00:40:29,365 --> 00:40:30,514
...but I just...

531
00:40:31,125 --> 00:40:33,161
I just really wanted to say...

532
00:40:34,605 --> 00:40:36,004
...thank you.

533
00:40:41,205 --> 00:40:42,684
Thanks for being my sister.

534
00:40:43,205 --> 00:40:44,433
It's all right.

535
00:40:44,685 --> 00:40:47,358
Let's just put this
all behind us now.

536
00:40:50,325 --> 00:40:52,077
What will we tell the aunts?

537
00:40:54,605 --> 00:40:55,640
Nothing.

538
00:41:32,525 --> 00:41:33,878
They're here.

539
00:41:34,885 --> 00:41:36,603
What if they don't like me?

540
00:41:37,125 --> 00:41:40,003
You won't believe it!
We danced naked under the full moon!

541
00:41:40,245 --> 00:41:41,200
It was so fun!

542
00:41:41,485 --> 00:41:42,964
- We did!
- So cool!

543
00:41:45,365 --> 00:41:46,115
Oh, my God!

544
00:41:46,365 --> 00:41:48,037
Aunt Gilly's home!

545
00:41:52,685 --> 00:41:56,439
You guys are so big!
I can't believe this!

546
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:03,357
Hi, Aunt Frances.

547
00:42:04,005 --> 00:42:06,041
My darling little girl.

548
00:42:08,285 --> 00:42:09,081
Oh, dear!

549
00:42:12,125 --> 00:42:14,719
A little mugwort
will fix that right up.

550
00:42:16,445 --> 00:42:17,400
Kylie...

551
00:42:17,645 --> 00:42:20,364
...why don't you and I
just go to the greenhouse?

552
00:42:21,085 --> 00:42:23,679
I'm so happy to see you, sweetie.

553
00:42:26,525 --> 00:42:28,117
Don't you worry, dear.

554
00:42:28,365 --> 00:42:30,833
Whoever he was,
he'll get what he deserves.

555
00:42:33,645 --> 00:42:36,921
I think a brownie for breakfast
would fix you right up.

556
00:42:37,165 --> 00:42:38,200
A brownie?

557
00:42:38,445 --> 00:42:39,594
You're still doing that?

558
00:42:39,845 --> 00:42:41,597
You've been away too long.

559
00:42:41,845 --> 00:42:43,119
Some things never change.

560
00:42:43,445 --> 00:42:45,800
Too long you have been away.

561
00:42:46,045 --> 00:42:46,841
Where are they?

562
00:42:56,445 --> 00:42:58,322
I love this stuff.

563
00:43:00,005 --> 00:43:02,360
It's great!
You've done a great job.

564
00:43:03,365 --> 00:43:07,199
If you're going to work here,
maybe you could, I don't know...

565
00:43:08,285 --> 00:43:08,922
...work.

566
00:43:09,165 --> 00:43:10,803
I am. I'm testing
the merchandise.

567
00:43:12,885 --> 00:43:17,037
You know where you can reach me.
I'll be back, if anyone cares.

568
00:43:23,365 --> 00:43:24,878
Did I do something wrong?

569
00:43:25,245 --> 00:43:26,314
Phone tree day.

570
00:43:26,645 --> 00:43:28,397
Phone tree day.

571
00:43:28,645 --> 00:43:30,954
Parents' hotline.
If there's an emergency...

572
00:43:31,205 --> 00:43:34,083
...like a snow day, they decide
who's the most responsible...

573
00:43:34,325 --> 00:43:35,963
You mean the most popular.

574
00:43:36,205 --> 00:43:37,638
- Responsible mother
to sound the alarm.

575
00:43:37,885 --> 00:43:40,638
Each mom calls the next.
It's a big deal to get chosen.

576
00:43:40,885 --> 00:43:43,604
Sally never gets picked.
Everybody knows she's a...

577
00:43:45,245 --> 00:43:46,234
Different.

578
00:43:49,845 --> 00:43:51,403
Quiet! Quiet, quiet!

579
00:43:52,045 --> 00:43:54,559
Third name from the top
of the phone tree is...

580
00:43:56,805 --> 00:43:57,954
...Dori Kancher.

581
00:44:05,405 --> 00:44:07,236
- Sorry to interrupt.
- Can I help you?

582
00:44:09,965 --> 00:44:11,159
My sister.

583
00:44:11,405 --> 00:44:12,963
Just wanted to see my sister.

584
00:44:17,125 --> 00:44:19,320
Is that a snake tattoo?

585
00:44:19,805 --> 00:44:22,638
Yeah. There's one
on her boob too.

586
00:44:23,165 --> 00:44:24,154
That's right.

587
00:44:24,405 --> 00:44:25,758
I'm back.

588
00:44:26,325 --> 00:44:29,158
Hang onto your husbands, girls.

589
00:44:31,565 --> 00:44:34,363
All that's missing now is
me naked without my homework.

590
00:44:34,605 --> 00:44:37,802
Second from the top of the phone tree
will be Abigail Little.

591
00:44:38,045 --> 00:44:39,398
Is this for real?

592
00:44:40,525 --> 00:44:42,117
She screwed Coach Halfacre.

593
00:44:45,685 --> 00:44:47,880
- Don't do that.
- It wasn't me.

594
00:44:48,125 --> 00:44:50,434
- I certainly didn't do it.
- It was you.

595
00:44:52,165 --> 00:44:55,282
Finally, I'm so pleased
to report this.

596
00:44:55,525 --> 00:44:58,198
The top of the phone tree list is...

597
00:45:00,125 --> 00:45:01,274
One moment.

598
00:45:06,445 --> 00:45:07,434
It's Sally Owens.

599
00:45:12,525 --> 00:45:14,117
Go, Sal!

600
00:45:14,525 --> 00:45:16,117
Now that was me.

601
00:45:29,125 --> 00:45:30,319
Eye of newt...

602
00:45:30,565 --> 00:45:32,237
...toe of frog...

603
00:45:32,485 --> 00:45:34,396
...wool of bat, tongue of dog...

604
00:45:34,685 --> 00:45:36,880
Adder's fork and blindworm's sting.

605
00:45:37,125 --> 00:45:39,320
Barbados lime is just the thing.

606
00:45:40,405 --> 00:45:42,760
Cragged salt like a sailor's stubble!

607
00:45:44,005 --> 00:45:45,074
Flip the switch...

608
00:45:45,325 --> 00:45:47,475
...and let the cauldron bubble.

609
00:45:49,885 --> 00:45:51,637
How convivial!

610
00:45:55,765 --> 00:45:57,118
Wakey-wakey!

611
00:46:04,165 --> 00:46:06,076
Midnight margaritas!

612
00:46:06,885 --> 00:46:08,034
Come on!

613
00:47:18,525 --> 00:47:20,322
No, this is serious.

614
00:47:20,565 --> 00:47:21,600
All right.

615
00:47:22,205 --> 00:47:23,763
I see a man...

616
00:47:24,005 --> 00:47:26,758
I see a man in
your future and he is...

617
00:47:27,045 --> 00:47:28,717
He is gorgeous.

618
00:47:33,205 --> 00:47:34,081
He is big.

619
00:47:37,245 --> 00:47:38,644
But you're scared to death...

620
00:47:38,885 --> 00:47:41,843
...and you wind up
like a frigid old hag...

621
00:47:42,085 --> 00:47:45,077
...with your two frigid
old hag aunts.

622
00:47:49,965 --> 00:47:51,956
I don't know where that came from.
That was weird.

623
00:47:52,205 --> 00:47:54,082
She's never been interested
in her gifts.

624
00:47:55,085 --> 00:47:56,962
- She just made that all up.
- Don't lie.

625
00:47:57,205 --> 00:47:58,604
Gillian has her own magic.

626
00:47:58,845 --> 00:48:00,881
And we all know what it is.

627
00:48:03,645 --> 00:48:04,395
Oh, please!

628
00:48:04,645 --> 00:48:07,034
Since when is being a slut
a crime in this family?

629
00:48:11,045 --> 00:48:12,876
What would you know about it?

630
00:48:13,125 --> 00:48:15,434
When we put that spell on you
for Michael...

631
00:48:15,685 --> 00:48:17,676
...we had to bind it with molasses...

632
00:48:17,925 --> 00:48:19,756
...just to get your legs to open up.

633
00:48:21,765 --> 00:48:22,959
That's so wrong.

634
00:48:26,085 --> 00:48:28,394
You self-centered shrew!

635
00:48:28,605 --> 00:48:29,401
Ingrate!

636
00:48:29,645 --> 00:48:30,441
Goody two-shoes!

637
00:48:30,685 --> 00:48:31,640
Witch!

638
00:48:50,125 --> 00:48:52,639
Quite as often as I should have

639
00:48:54,685 --> 00:48:57,597
Could have said and done

640
00:48:58,005 --> 00:49:00,439
I just never found the time

641
00:49:03,405 --> 00:49:05,202
You were always...

642
00:49:05,445 --> 00:49:07,163
...on my mind

643
00:49:12,005 --> 00:49:13,882
Where did this bottle come from?

644
00:49:15,605 --> 00:49:17,038
Where did this bottle come from?

645
00:49:17,285 --> 00:49:19,799
Someone left it on the porch

646
00:49:32,565 --> 00:49:34,442
What's going on here?

647
00:49:35,045 --> 00:49:36,524
What's going on with you?

648
00:49:36,765 --> 00:49:38,483
What's going on in this house?

649
00:49:39,325 --> 00:49:41,122
Something's going on.
I can smell it.

650
00:49:41,365 --> 00:49:44,596
It's a very distinct smell.
It's the smell of bullshit.

651
00:49:45,285 --> 00:49:47,196
I don't know what
you're talking about.

652
00:49:49,725 --> 00:49:51,044
Broom fell.

653
00:49:51,285 --> 00:49:52,274
Company's coming.

654
00:49:56,765 --> 00:49:58,278
We had a problem.
We handled it.

655
00:49:58,525 --> 00:50:00,163
We deserve an explanation.

656
00:50:05,965 --> 00:50:07,034
Right.

657
00:50:07,645 --> 00:50:08,964
Come on, Jet, let's go.

658
00:50:14,325 --> 00:50:15,519
No.

659
00:50:17,565 --> 00:50:19,999
It's just not possible.
Don't even think it.

660
00:50:20,285 --> 00:50:22,401
Then tell me how that got here.

661
00:50:22,645 --> 00:50:24,124
How did this bottle get here?

662
00:50:24,365 --> 00:50:26,356
It's not possible.

663
00:50:39,565 --> 00:50:41,283
Leaving like this
is a harsh lesson.

664
00:50:41,525 --> 00:50:43,243
A lesson they must learn
on their own.

665
00:50:43,485 --> 00:50:44,998
What about the little ones?

666
00:50:45,245 --> 00:50:46,598
Not to worry, Jetty.

667
00:50:46,845 --> 00:50:50,235
A good piece of Maria's hanging rope
will protect them.

668
00:50:50,605 --> 00:50:53,039
You must promise us
you won 't take them off.

669
00:50:53,285 --> 00:50:56,755
- Not until we come home.
- We'll only be gone a short while.

670
00:50:57,165 --> 00:50:58,678
Do you hear us?

671
00:50:59,045 --> 00:51:00,319
Promise?

672
00:51:02,965 --> 00:51:04,683
- Love you.
- Love you too.

673
00:51:13,525 --> 00:51:16,164
Make her stop.
I'll pay whatever it takes.

674
00:51:16,405 --> 00:51:18,157
Honey, can I see that a second?

675
00:51:18,405 --> 00:51:19,554
Thanks.

676
00:51:20,765 --> 00:51:22,437
What's that thing
around your neck?

677
00:51:22,685 --> 00:51:25,563
- The aunts gave it to us.
- They said it'd protect us.

678
00:51:26,365 --> 00:51:30,836
Kylie, please get that mint from
the garden before your bus comes.

679
00:51:31,325 --> 00:51:33,316
Where is the aspirin?

680
00:51:36,525 --> 00:51:38,959
- Please do as I say.
- Not while he's out there.

681
00:51:42,045 --> 00:51:43,842
Not while who's out where?

682
00:51:44,085 --> 00:51:45,313
The man under the roses.

683
00:51:45,805 --> 00:51:46,840
What?

684
00:51:51,285 --> 00:51:53,640
I don't see him.
Are you looking at him now?

685
00:51:53,885 --> 00:51:55,079
He's right there.

686
00:51:55,325 --> 00:51:56,235
Where?

687
00:51:57,885 --> 00:51:58,954
By the roses.

688
00:52:00,165 --> 00:52:01,803
They grew overnight.

689
00:52:02,845 --> 00:52:03,960
Oh, shit!

690
00:52:06,085 --> 00:52:07,996
Okay, sweetie, we'll get rid of it.

691
00:52:08,245 --> 00:52:10,042
You better call the aunts now.

692
00:52:10,285 --> 00:52:11,115
They left.

693
00:52:11,365 --> 00:52:13,242
What do you mean?
When did they leave?

694
00:52:13,485 --> 00:52:15,237
They said to give you a message:

695
00:52:16,005 --> 00:52:17,358
"Clean up your own mess. "

696
00:52:23,605 --> 00:52:24,833
Oh, God!

697
00:52:27,805 --> 00:52:30,797
You stop this, Jimmy!
You stop it!

698
00:52:31,045 --> 00:52:32,398
He's making them grow.

699
00:52:32,645 --> 00:52:35,398
He's trying to get to us
by making them grow!

700
00:52:35,645 --> 00:52:36,998
You leave us alone!

701
00:52:37,285 --> 00:52:39,560
Stop it, Gillian!
Stop it!

702
00:52:39,885 --> 00:52:41,204
Stop it!

703
00:52:43,405 --> 00:52:44,360
What?

704
00:52:44,645 --> 00:52:45,714
His boots!

705
00:52:48,765 --> 00:52:50,084
Oh, my God!

706
00:52:52,445 --> 00:52:53,400
Is he rising?

707
00:52:58,365 --> 00:53:01,038
Or is the ground sinking?

708
00:53:05,325 --> 00:53:08,123
What is he doing to us?
He's trying to get...

709
00:53:08,365 --> 00:53:10,879
Go inside.
Take care of the kids.

710
00:53:34,725 --> 00:53:36,363
It's early for roses, isn't it?

711
00:53:37,045 --> 00:53:38,876
Can I help you with something?

712
00:53:39,125 --> 00:53:41,593
I sure hope so.
Name's Gary Hallet.

713
00:53:41,845 --> 00:53:44,598
Special investigator,
prosecutor's office in Tucson.

714
00:53:51,445 --> 00:53:54,642
You sure are a long way
from home, Officer.

715
00:53:55,125 --> 00:53:56,080
Yes, ma'am.

716
00:53:57,005 --> 00:54:00,395
I was kind of hoping to talk
to your sister, Gillian.

717
00:54:00,645 --> 00:54:01,680
If she's around.

718
00:54:02,125 --> 00:54:05,242
She might have some information
on a case I'm working on.

719
00:54:05,485 --> 00:54:06,838
All right, I'll get her.

720
00:54:13,205 --> 00:54:15,435
How did you know
that I was her sister?

721
00:54:18,205 --> 00:54:20,321
Lucky guess, I guess.

722
00:54:23,285 --> 00:54:25,321
Why don't you come inside?

723
00:54:29,645 --> 00:54:31,840
A cop looking for Jimmy
wants to talk to you.

724
00:54:32,085 --> 00:54:34,076
And I think I'm having
a heart attack.

725
00:54:34,525 --> 00:54:35,560
Just calm down.

726
00:54:35,805 --> 00:54:37,363
Calm down.

727
00:54:38,925 --> 00:54:42,474
What is the question? The question is:
"How much can he know?"

728
00:54:42,725 --> 00:54:46,718
He seems to know a lot because
he's come all the way from Arizona.

729
00:54:47,205 --> 00:54:49,799
And I know this sounds
really strange...

730
00:54:50,005 --> 00:54:51,996
...but I don't think
I can lie to him.

731
00:54:52,245 --> 00:54:53,917
Of course you can lie to him.

732
00:54:54,245 --> 00:54:55,155
Breathe, breathe.

733
00:54:55,405 --> 00:54:57,361
Here's the story, right?
Here's the story.

734
00:54:58,685 --> 00:54:59,674
I left him...

735
00:55:00,045 --> 00:55:01,763
...because he hit me.

736
00:55:02,245 --> 00:55:04,600
And we haven't seen him since.
It's as simple as that.

737
00:55:05,005 --> 00:55:06,597
You just let me handle the rest.

738
00:55:06,845 --> 00:55:08,483
- Okay, good.
- All right?

739
00:55:09,165 --> 00:55:11,838
Left him because he hit you
and haven't seen him... What?

740
00:55:12,085 --> 00:55:13,564
Is he cute?

741
00:55:14,085 --> 00:55:15,564
Yeah. He's nice.

742
00:55:16,525 --> 00:55:17,560
In a very...

743
00:55:17,805 --> 00:55:19,841
...penal code sort of way.

744
00:55:20,085 --> 00:55:22,076
I left him because she hit him...

745
00:55:34,925 --> 00:55:36,153
Just herbs.

746
00:55:37,165 --> 00:55:38,359
From the garden.

747
00:55:42,645 --> 00:55:45,478
So what brings you to the island?

748
00:55:48,125 --> 00:55:48,875
This.

749
00:55:54,645 --> 00:55:56,203
You read my letter?

750
00:55:56,445 --> 00:55:57,719
Yes, ma'am, I did.

751
00:55:57,965 --> 00:56:00,115
It was a very personal letter.

752
00:56:00,645 --> 00:56:02,283
Yes, ma'am, it was.

753
00:56:05,125 --> 00:56:06,035
What?

754
00:56:06,285 --> 00:56:07,354
I'm sorry.

755
00:56:08,445 --> 00:56:10,163
- You seem familiar.
- Hello, there.

756
00:56:12,485 --> 00:56:13,884
Morning, Miss...

757
00:56:14,725 --> 00:56:15,840
Good morning, Miss Owens.

758
00:56:16,205 --> 00:56:17,240
Good morning...

759
00:56:17,485 --> 00:56:18,520
...Mr...?

760
00:56:18,765 --> 00:56:19,675
Mr. Hallet.

761
00:56:20,725 --> 00:56:22,761
I'm not going to
beat around the bush.

762
00:56:23,005 --> 00:56:26,315
I need to find your boyfriend,
James Angelov.

763
00:56:27,085 --> 00:56:28,882
I don't know where he is.

764
00:56:29,165 --> 00:56:32,521
I wouldn't exactly call him
my boyfriend.

765
00:56:33,285 --> 00:56:35,640
He's more like a big mistake.

766
00:56:37,445 --> 00:56:39,481
Is that his handiwork there?

767
00:56:39,845 --> 00:56:42,564
If a man hits me,
he only does it once.

768
00:56:44,765 --> 00:56:47,325
Can I take a peek at your...?

769
00:56:50,445 --> 00:56:52,037
Now, I can tell...

770
00:56:52,645 --> 00:56:55,603
...that you've never touched a woman
in anger all your life.

771
00:56:55,845 --> 00:56:57,642
May I have my hand back, please?

772
00:56:57,885 --> 00:57:00,524
You're telling me
you have no idea where he is?

773
00:57:00,765 --> 00:57:01,561
I told you.

774
00:57:01,925 --> 00:57:04,962
He hit me
and I haven't seen him since.

775
00:57:05,205 --> 00:57:06,001
When was that?

776
00:57:06,445 --> 00:57:07,480
Three days ago.

777
00:57:07,725 --> 00:57:09,875
Right, Sal? Three days.

778
00:57:10,125 --> 00:57:11,353
Excuse me.

779
00:57:13,325 --> 00:57:15,202
Whose car is that
in the driveway?

780
00:57:15,405 --> 00:57:17,396
The one with
the Arizona plates?

781
00:57:17,645 --> 00:57:18,839
That's my car.

782
00:57:19,085 --> 00:57:20,040
That's your car.

783
00:57:21,165 --> 00:57:22,883
Plate number 2-2-9 M-O-B?

784
00:57:24,165 --> 00:57:26,520
That's James L. Angelov's car.

785
00:57:26,885 --> 00:57:27,954
Come on now.

786
00:57:30,725 --> 00:57:33,034
We stole it, and it's a crime.

787
00:57:33,285 --> 00:57:36,800
I know this,
but he basically kidnapped her.

788
00:57:38,205 --> 00:57:39,354
He kidnapped you?

789
00:57:40,925 --> 00:57:43,917
He didn't really kidnap her.
He sort of, like...

790
00:57:44,165 --> 00:57:45,200
...a little nap.

791
00:57:45,525 --> 00:57:47,720
No, there was a car and she...

792
00:57:51,365 --> 00:57:53,037
What happened was, that she...

793
00:57:53,725 --> 00:57:56,285
You should know,
she has the worst taste in men.

794
00:57:57,325 --> 00:57:58,360
Well, you do.

795
00:57:58,605 --> 00:58:01,642
So I picked her up and I drove her
right back here.

796
00:58:01,885 --> 00:58:03,557
And we would be...

797
00:58:04,085 --> 00:58:07,839
...so happy to give him back his car,
because it is a crime...

798
00:58:08,085 --> 00:58:09,438
As you say...

799
00:58:10,445 --> 00:58:13,039
...you just don't know where he is...

800
00:58:13,525 --> 00:58:15,038
...to give him back that car.

801
00:58:15,285 --> 00:58:17,560
So basically,
nobody knows where he is.

802
00:58:17,805 --> 00:58:18,760
I'm sorry, what?

803
00:58:19,565 --> 00:58:21,601
You don't have any idea
where he is?

804
00:58:24,605 --> 00:58:27,165
Would you mind if I just
took a look around?

805
00:58:28,365 --> 00:58:29,434
Good.

806
00:58:31,565 --> 00:58:34,125
What is wrong with you?

807
00:58:34,725 --> 00:58:36,317
I don't know!

808
00:58:36,645 --> 00:58:39,478
This young lady's name
was Phoebe Stone.

809
00:58:40,365 --> 00:58:42,356
Two years ago,
she was found strangled...

810
00:58:43,085 --> 00:58:44,803
...lying on the side of the highway.

811
00:58:45,045 --> 00:58:47,036
Her body had been marked...

812
00:58:47,285 --> 00:58:48,479
...with a kind of brand...

813
00:58:49,165 --> 00:58:51,599
...burned right into the face.

814
00:58:52,605 --> 00:58:54,596
Any help you ladies can give me...

815
00:58:54,845 --> 00:58:57,234
...in locating this
ex-friend of yours...

816
00:58:57,485 --> 00:58:59,362
...would sure be appreciated.

817
00:59:16,205 --> 00:59:17,763
She's all yours.

818
00:59:22,605 --> 00:59:24,004
Go arrest her!

819
00:59:24,245 --> 00:59:27,840
Their niece owns a shop where
they cook up a special placenta.

820
00:59:28,085 --> 00:59:32,283
And that's why the aunts don't age.
I tell you, they just don't age.

821
00:59:32,525 --> 00:59:35,801
- She's selling placentas?
- A placenta bar.

822
00:59:36,045 --> 00:59:38,559
On Halloween, they all
jump off the roof and fly!

823
00:59:38,805 --> 00:59:41,239
When they get mad at you,
they hex you.

824
00:59:41,485 --> 00:59:45,398
I wouldn't be surprised if he
turned up in a ditch somewhere.

825
00:59:46,005 --> 00:59:47,154
Sara, that is not true.

826
00:59:47,725 --> 00:59:50,922
- She's not saying they murdered him.
- Yes, I am.

827
00:59:51,485 --> 00:59:54,158
Just that maybe they shook
his hand and then he died.

828
00:59:54,365 --> 00:59:55,844
It's very mysterious.

829
00:59:56,045 --> 00:59:58,843
If any man dared take on
an Owens woman...

830
00:59:59,085 --> 01:00:02,361
...he'd live briefly in
the euphoria of her love...

831
01:00:02,605 --> 01:00:04,482
...until meeting an untimely death.

832
01:00:06,085 --> 01:00:07,279
The curse.

833
01:00:08,085 --> 01:00:09,074
Witch? Yeah.

834
01:00:09,325 --> 01:00:10,314
Evil? No.

835
01:00:10,565 --> 01:00:13,477
You get your psychos now and then,
animal slaughter...

836
01:00:13,885 --> 01:00:16,877
...ritual human disembowelment,
but that's really pretty rare.

837
01:00:17,125 --> 01:00:18,797
See, it's a pagan label.

838
01:00:19,045 --> 01:00:20,160
It's Sally.

839
01:00:23,045 --> 01:00:24,876
She's definitely not
into that stuff.

840
01:00:25,845 --> 01:00:27,164
She's not?

841
01:00:27,645 --> 01:00:28,441
Miss Owens...

842
01:00:28,765 --> 01:00:30,562
...I have a bone to pick with you.

843
01:00:30,805 --> 01:00:32,477
What can I do for you, Dwight?

844
01:00:32,725 --> 01:00:34,636
I could've gone
to a qualified doctor...

845
01:00:34,885 --> 01:00:37,558
...to attend to this
scalp condition of mine.

846
01:00:37,845 --> 01:00:40,279
Now, the more I use,
the less it works.

847
01:00:40,605 --> 01:00:41,924
The product doesn't work.

848
01:00:42,165 --> 01:00:44,759
That's because it doesn't
go on your head.

849
01:00:45,085 --> 01:00:46,404
If I don't put it on my head...

850
01:00:46,645 --> 01:00:48,761
...where the hell else would it go?

851
01:00:49,805 --> 01:00:51,875
Try to remember.

852
01:00:58,605 --> 01:00:59,879
My mistake.

853
01:01:04,685 --> 01:01:06,004
There you go.

854
01:01:06,525 --> 01:01:08,083
Strange town.

855
01:01:08,325 --> 01:01:11,283
Never spent this much
on shampoo before...

856
01:01:11,805 --> 01:01:13,397
...in my life.

857
01:01:18,845 --> 01:01:21,359
Am I under some kind of surveillance?

858
01:01:22,245 --> 01:01:23,155
Should you be?

859
01:01:23,405 --> 01:01:25,077
If you want to know
something, ask me.

860
01:01:26,245 --> 01:01:27,439
I already did.

861
01:01:27,685 --> 01:01:30,961
And there appears to be something
missing from your story.

862
01:01:34,445 --> 01:01:37,994
I want to talk to you more,
but I got to finish some homework.

863
01:01:38,245 --> 01:01:41,157
How's about I come by your house
tomorrow morning?

864
01:01:41,645 --> 01:01:42,680
Fine.

865
01:01:43,365 --> 01:01:44,434
10 a.m.?

866
01:01:45,045 --> 01:01:46,000
Fine.

867
01:01:47,365 --> 01:01:48,639
That's a date.

868
01:02:29,165 --> 01:02:30,757
Jimmy, is that you?

869
01:02:37,725 --> 01:02:39,044
Go away.

870
01:02:40,965 --> 01:02:42,398
Go away.

871
01:02:51,565 --> 01:02:54,318
To banish unwanted persons,
it says you need blessing seeds.

872
01:02:54,645 --> 01:02:55,964
All right. Good.

873
01:02:57,685 --> 01:03:00,153
- What about nigellus seeds?
- It's the same thing.

874
01:03:00,765 --> 01:03:02,118
Wow, is it?

875
01:03:02,365 --> 01:03:04,117
Good. You're good at this.

876
01:03:04,725 --> 01:03:07,159
Why can't we tell Mommy
we're sending the policeman away?

877
01:03:07,405 --> 01:03:10,397
Your mommy likes to pretend
she doesn't do magic.

878
01:03:10,645 --> 01:03:13,876
And we must banish this man
for your mommy's own good.

879
01:03:14,685 --> 01:03:17,199
Blessing seeds. Right.
What else do we need?

880
01:03:17,445 --> 01:03:20,323
I told you to listen out the door
for Mr. Hallet.

881
01:03:21,245 --> 01:03:22,200
Blessing seeds...

882
01:03:24,805 --> 01:03:27,273
Oh, yeah, milk thistle.
I can't find anything here.

883
01:03:27,525 --> 01:03:28,958
Was this Mommy's?

884
01:03:31,325 --> 01:03:33,236
Yeah. Where did you get that?

885
01:03:33,885 --> 01:03:35,955
"He can flip pancakes in the air.

886
01:03:36,205 --> 01:03:39,003
He'll have one green eye, one blue.

887
01:03:39,245 --> 01:03:41,361
Hear my call a mile away. "

888
01:03:41,885 --> 01:03:43,477
Was it about Daddy?

889
01:03:46,685 --> 01:03:48,164
Yeah.

890
01:03:49,045 --> 01:03:50,683
But Daddy had brown eyes.

891
01:03:54,805 --> 01:03:56,238
You know...

892
01:03:56,885 --> 01:03:59,399
...the truth is, this wasn't
about your daddy.

893
01:03:59,645 --> 01:04:02,637
This was when your mommy
was little...

894
01:04:03,125 --> 01:04:06,037
...and she was trying to invent
a guy who didn't exist...

895
01:04:06,285 --> 01:04:08,082
...to protect herself.

896
01:04:08,325 --> 01:04:09,553
It's crazy.

897
01:04:09,885 --> 01:04:11,159
But...

898
01:04:12,885 --> 01:04:14,318
She loved your daddy.

899
01:04:14,565 --> 01:04:17,363
She loved him very, very much.

900
01:04:17,605 --> 01:04:19,960
I can't wait to fall in love.

901
01:04:26,845 --> 01:04:28,597
Kylie, listen to me.

902
01:04:31,605 --> 01:04:35,120
Do you ever put your arms out
and spin really fast?

903
01:04:35,365 --> 01:04:37,560
- She does it all the time.
- She does?

904
01:04:38,365 --> 01:04:39,798
That's what love is like.

905
01:04:41,125 --> 01:04:42,558
It makes your heart race.

906
01:04:42,805 --> 01:04:45,239
It turns the world upside-down.

907
01:04:46,165 --> 01:04:48,474
But if you're not careful...

908
01:04:48,725 --> 01:04:52,001
...if you don't keep your eyes
on something still...

909
01:04:53,685 --> 01:04:55,482
...you can lose your balance.

910
01:04:55,725 --> 01:04:59,035
You can't see what's happening
to the people around you.

911
01:05:03,485 --> 01:05:06,045
You can't see that you're
about to fall.

912
01:05:07,045 --> 01:05:09,081
Don't be sad, Aunt Gillian.

913
01:05:11,045 --> 01:05:12,956
I won't let you fall down.

914
01:05:13,405 --> 01:05:14,520
He's here! He's here!

915
01:05:15,245 --> 01:05:17,713
Make sure you tell him
about breakfast. Go!

916
01:05:20,605 --> 01:05:23,324
You came for breakfast.
We're having pancakes.

917
01:05:23,965 --> 01:05:25,842
I just came to talk to your mom.

918
01:05:26,085 --> 01:05:27,803
Great!
She's having pancakes too.

919
01:05:30,325 --> 01:05:31,758
Do you have a gun?

920
01:05:32,085 --> 01:05:33,279
Can I see it?

921
01:05:36,965 --> 01:05:38,683
He's here for breakfast.

922
01:05:40,325 --> 01:05:42,043
I have a question or two.

923
01:05:42,365 --> 01:05:45,516
- He's going to stay!
- Oh, good! Good work.

924
01:05:45,885 --> 01:05:49,673
Now go back out there
and keep them away from here.

925
01:05:52,565 --> 01:05:53,475
Belladonna.

926
01:05:53,725 --> 01:05:57,684
A sedative. People put it in
their tea to relax, calm their nerves.

927
01:05:58,205 --> 01:06:00,878
Some people also use it as a poison.

928
01:06:01,725 --> 01:06:02,680
Which people?

929
01:06:04,325 --> 01:06:05,724
Witch people.

930
01:06:05,965 --> 01:06:07,318
Witches.

931
01:06:08,285 --> 01:06:10,355
I guess you found me out, huh?

932
01:06:11,725 --> 01:06:12,441
I did.

933
01:06:12,965 --> 01:06:14,603
You should come here on Halloween.

934
01:06:14,845 --> 01:06:16,198
You'd really see something.

935
01:06:16,445 --> 01:06:17,241
Yeah?

936
01:06:17,485 --> 01:06:19,840
We all jump off the roof and fly.

937
01:06:20,085 --> 01:06:21,837
We kill our husbands too.

938
01:06:22,685 --> 01:06:25,153
Or is that outside
your jurisdiction?

939
01:06:26,085 --> 01:06:29,839
Do you have any idea how strange
this all sounds to me?

940
01:06:30,165 --> 01:06:33,840
I got people telling me you're
here cooking up placenta bars...

941
01:06:34,085 --> 01:06:35,757
...you're into devil worship...

942
01:06:36,005 --> 01:06:38,644
No, there's no devil in the craft.

943
01:06:39,045 --> 01:06:41,115
So what kind of...

944
01:06:41,365 --> 01:06:43,117
...craft do you do?

945
01:06:43,365 --> 01:06:44,593
Do I do?

946
01:06:45,205 --> 01:06:47,639
I manufacture bath oils.

947
01:06:48,445 --> 01:06:50,197
And soaps and hand lotions...

948
01:06:50,445 --> 01:06:52,117
...and shampoo.

949
01:06:52,565 --> 01:06:54,237
And the aunts...

950
01:06:54,485 --> 01:06:57,158
...they like to meddle
in people's love lives.

951
01:07:00,445 --> 01:07:02,003
Magic isn't...

952
01:07:02,245 --> 01:07:04,156
...just spells and potions.

953
01:07:08,085 --> 01:07:09,404
Your badge?

954
01:07:18,045 --> 01:07:19,637
It's just a star.

955
01:07:20,565 --> 01:07:21,793
Just another symbol.

956
01:07:22,045 --> 01:07:23,478
Your talisman.

957
01:07:24,885 --> 01:07:26,921
It can't stop criminals
in their tracks...

958
01:07:27,165 --> 01:07:28,154
...can it?

959
01:07:29,765 --> 01:07:32,404
It has power because
you believe it does.

960
01:07:42,005 --> 01:07:43,484
Wish you could believe in me.

961
01:07:46,965 --> 01:07:48,318
Miss Owens...

962
01:07:50,245 --> 01:07:52,281
...are you hiding James Angelov?

963
01:07:52,605 --> 01:07:54,038
Not in this house.

964
01:07:56,565 --> 01:08:00,160
Did you or your sister
kill James Angelov?

965
01:08:00,965 --> 01:08:03,115
Oh, yeah.
Couple of times.

966
01:08:05,445 --> 01:08:07,401
Antonia, could you make
more of a mess?

967
01:08:07,645 --> 01:08:09,875
- Mom, I'm cooking.
- I can see that.

968
01:08:10,205 --> 01:08:11,240
Hey, there.

969
01:08:11,485 --> 01:08:13,840
Did you ever see a saguaro cactus?

970
01:08:15,325 --> 01:08:16,883
Step aside, you.

971
01:08:18,485 --> 01:08:19,474
You're about to.

972
01:08:40,885 --> 01:08:43,080
One stack of flapjacks...

973
01:08:43,325 --> 01:08:44,440
...and...

974
01:08:44,725 --> 01:08:47,285
...goodbye, Mr. Hallet.

975
01:08:47,765 --> 01:08:50,074
He knows how to flip pancakes.

976
01:08:52,965 --> 01:08:54,523
I assume you don't want pancakes.

977
01:08:54,765 --> 01:08:56,721
No, we want them!
We want them!

978
01:08:56,965 --> 01:08:59,354
Be careful. They tend to use
those as Frisbees.

979
01:09:01,485 --> 01:09:03,555
Can you ride a pony backwards?

980
01:09:04,605 --> 01:09:07,119
Backwards, forwards, sideways,
you name it.

981
01:09:07,565 --> 01:09:09,556
Okay, first troll.

982
01:09:09,885 --> 01:09:10,761
Look.

983
01:09:11,125 --> 01:09:12,444
A star!

984
01:09:13,485 --> 01:09:15,203
- This is not yours.
- That's all right.

985
01:09:16,045 --> 01:09:17,114
Second troll.

986
01:09:18,365 --> 01:09:21,994
And if you're anything like my girls...
here. It'll keep you clean.

987
01:09:22,245 --> 01:09:24,520
Isn't this cozy?

988
01:09:25,645 --> 01:09:27,124
Hi, Gary.

989
01:09:27,365 --> 01:09:29,037
I can call you Gary, can't I?

990
01:09:29,285 --> 01:09:30,081
Why not?

991
01:09:30,325 --> 01:09:31,075
Coffee?

992
01:09:31,325 --> 01:09:33,520
You must try my syrup.

993
01:09:33,845 --> 01:09:35,324
Here's the syrup.

994
01:09:36,165 --> 01:09:36,995
No! No!

995
01:09:53,885 --> 01:09:55,079
Ready?

996
01:09:55,325 --> 01:09:56,280
Go!

997
01:09:57,725 --> 01:09:58,635
Okay, yes!

998
01:09:58,885 --> 01:09:59,761
Let's go.

999
01:10:00,285 --> 01:10:02,003
I guess they didn't want
to eat that.

1000
01:10:02,245 --> 01:10:03,963
I guess not.

1001
01:10:30,325 --> 01:10:32,122
I've been looking for this.

1002
01:10:34,645 --> 01:10:36,158
This is his party trick.

1003
01:10:37,245 --> 01:10:38,644
It's your ring, is it?

1004
01:10:38,885 --> 01:10:39,761
Could I have it?

1005
01:10:40,005 --> 01:10:41,757
What do you think
you're playing at?

1006
01:10:42,005 --> 01:10:43,154
What do you mean?

1007
01:10:46,965 --> 01:10:49,433
You better get yourselves
a damn good lawyer.

1008
01:10:49,685 --> 01:10:52,199
And don't even think
about leaving town.

1009
01:10:53,805 --> 01:10:55,841
What was in that syrup?

1010
01:10:59,205 --> 01:11:02,402
We just stick to our stories.
No body, no crime.

1011
01:11:03,365 --> 01:11:05,401
Oh, I'm sorry.

1012
01:11:06,325 --> 01:11:07,758
I'm feeling like shit.

1013
01:11:08,005 --> 01:11:09,199
I'm not sleeping.

1014
01:11:09,445 --> 01:11:10,514
I. Me. Mine.

1015
01:11:10,765 --> 01:11:12,403
That's all you can think about.

1016
01:11:12,645 --> 01:11:13,521
You.

1017
01:11:13,765 --> 01:11:15,118
It's all about you.

1018
01:11:18,325 --> 01:11:20,395
- I don't want to fight.
- Don't walk away from me.

1019
01:11:21,845 --> 01:11:24,405
I'm sick and tired
of cleaning up your messes.

1020
01:11:26,325 --> 01:11:28,361
Yeah, you're right.
You're always right.

1021
01:11:29,285 --> 01:11:30,923
I'm just a mess.

1022
01:11:31,165 --> 01:11:33,360
Just one big mess!

1023
01:11:35,165 --> 01:11:36,644
At least I've lived my life.

1024
01:11:36,885 --> 01:11:39,843
You hate me for it because
it scares the hell out of you.

1025
01:11:40,165 --> 01:11:42,315
Gillian, I don't hate you.

1026
01:11:42,725 --> 01:11:46,240
You spend all your energy
trying to fit in, be normal!

1027
01:11:46,485 --> 01:11:47,804
But you'll never fit in.

1028
01:11:48,045 --> 01:11:50,559
Because we're different!
And so are your girls.

1029
01:11:51,845 --> 01:11:53,597
You leave them out of this.

1030
01:11:53,885 --> 01:11:56,797
All my life, I've wished
I had half your talent.

1031
01:11:59,045 --> 01:12:00,797
You're wasting yourself!

1032
01:12:01,045 --> 01:12:03,559
I want you out of here.
I want you gone.

1033
01:12:05,085 --> 01:12:06,598
Okay, fine.

1034
01:12:07,285 --> 01:12:08,604
I'm gone.

1035
01:12:09,365 --> 01:12:10,275
Good.

1036
01:12:12,365 --> 01:12:14,321
What? What are you doing?

1037
01:12:14,565 --> 01:12:15,395
Where are you going?

1038
01:12:15,685 --> 01:12:17,403
I'm doing the right thing.

1039
01:12:18,645 --> 01:12:20,761
You're not telling him
what happened!

1040
01:12:21,005 --> 01:12:24,077
Funny. The moment he walked in,
that's all I want to do.

1041
01:12:24,325 --> 01:12:26,475
Will you get on your knees
and beg for mercy?

1042
01:12:28,405 --> 01:12:30,839
You want me to be true to myself?

1043
01:12:31,325 --> 01:12:32,758
Then watch this.

1044
01:12:50,845 --> 01:12:53,484
It's the goddamn Twilight Zone.

1045
01:12:58,885 --> 01:13:01,797
- It was Jimmy's ring.
- Oh, really.

1046
01:13:02,045 --> 01:13:03,956
I know you knew that,
but I needed to tell you.

1047
01:13:04,205 --> 01:13:05,638
I was serious back there.

1048
01:13:05,885 --> 01:13:08,445
Get yourself a lawyer
before you talk to me.

1049
01:13:08,685 --> 01:13:10,243
I don't want a lawyer.

1050
01:13:17,405 --> 01:13:18,520
All right.

1051
01:13:23,525 --> 01:13:24,958
Come on in.

1052
01:13:25,605 --> 01:13:27,402
Excuse the mess.

1053
01:13:28,045 --> 01:13:30,115
Wasn't expecting company.

1054
01:13:31,485 --> 01:13:33,396
Have yourself a seat.

1055
01:13:35,365 --> 01:13:37,242
Let's see what I'll need here.

1056
01:13:39,685 --> 01:13:42,279
You don't need to look
at that stuff.

1057
01:13:52,165 --> 01:13:54,395
How many times
did you read my letter?

1058
01:13:55,365 --> 01:13:56,480
A few.

1059
01:13:57,805 --> 01:13:59,716
I have to study all the evidence.

1060
01:14:01,645 --> 01:14:03,636
Okay, you want to sit down?

1061
01:14:04,685 --> 01:14:06,835
This is the testimony of Sally Owens.

1062
01:14:07,085 --> 01:14:08,996
March 8th, 1998.

1063
01:14:12,445 --> 01:14:14,083
You going to sit down?

1064
01:14:21,965 --> 01:14:23,637
Where is James Angelov?

1065
01:14:24,205 --> 01:14:26,275
I think he's in the spirit world.

1066
01:14:26,525 --> 01:14:29,358
- You think he's dead.
- No, I think he's haunting us.

1067
01:14:34,085 --> 01:14:36,235
What evidence did you get
from reading my letter?

1068
01:14:36,645 --> 01:14:38,237
Did you or your sister...

1069
01:14:38,485 --> 01:14:40,157
...kill James Angelov?

1070
01:14:42,045 --> 01:14:44,115
Gillian didn't kill anybody.

1071
01:14:44,765 --> 01:14:46,517
Gillian didn't.

1072
01:14:47,005 --> 01:14:48,996
Gillian didn't, but you did?

1073
01:14:51,605 --> 01:14:52,720
Did you?

1074
01:14:54,085 --> 01:14:55,518
Sally, did you?

1075
01:14:59,365 --> 01:15:02,038
What if I told you I did?
What would you do?

1076
01:15:03,645 --> 01:15:06,876
Would you send me to jail
for life all because...

1077
01:15:07,125 --> 01:15:09,275
...the world was short a man
like Jimmy Angelov?

1078
01:15:09,525 --> 01:15:12,517
It's not for you or me to decide
how he should be punished.

1079
01:15:16,805 --> 01:15:18,204
He has to be held accountable.

1080
01:15:18,445 --> 01:15:20,356
Well, he has been punished.

1081
01:15:23,325 --> 01:15:24,474
He has?

1082
01:15:32,445 --> 01:15:36,233
You should get a lawyer's advice
before we go any further.

1083
01:15:38,245 --> 01:15:39,439
Now listen.

1084
01:15:39,765 --> 01:15:42,233
I know you're in
some kind of trouble.

1085
01:15:42,485 --> 01:15:43,759
All right?

1086
01:15:44,885 --> 01:15:46,557
If you will trust me...

1087
01:15:46,805 --> 01:15:48,284
...tell me what you know...

1088
01:15:49,285 --> 01:15:51,003
...I promise you...

1089
01:15:51,645 --> 01:15:55,797
...I will do everything I can
to keep you from harm's way.

1090
01:16:14,445 --> 01:16:16,003
I can't, I can't, I can't.

1091
01:16:16,245 --> 01:16:18,076
I can't either, I'm sorry.

1092
01:16:33,845 --> 01:16:35,881
One green eye, one blue.

1093
01:16:39,965 --> 01:16:41,557
I can't, I can't.

1094
01:16:41,805 --> 01:16:42,954
I've got to go.

1095
01:16:46,685 --> 01:16:48,596
I was born with it.

1096
01:16:52,645 --> 01:16:53,964
Mommy.

1097
01:17:02,565 --> 01:17:04,044
I need you.

1098
01:17:18,885 --> 01:17:20,034
What's going on?

1099
01:17:20,285 --> 01:17:22,241
I didn't do anything.

1100
01:17:22,485 --> 01:17:24,635
Go downstairs. It's okay.

1101
01:17:50,645 --> 01:17:51,475
Officer Hallet.

1102
01:17:53,445 --> 01:17:56,596
Just looking at you
makes me homesick.

1103
01:18:41,085 --> 01:18:41,881
What's wrong?

1104
01:18:44,205 --> 01:18:45,433
Cat got your tongue?

1105
01:19:31,725 --> 01:19:32,601
Someday...

1106
01:19:32,845 --> 01:19:35,120
...you'll explain this all to me.

1107
01:19:51,285 --> 01:19:52,877
What was that, Sally?

1108
01:19:53,125 --> 01:19:55,036
That was him, wasn't it?

1109
01:19:55,485 --> 01:19:56,804
Is he gone, or what?

1110
01:19:57,045 --> 01:19:59,354
You killed his spirit,
but I took his life.

1111
01:19:59,605 --> 01:20:02,995
I'll tell you all you need to know.
How I did it, where I buried him.

1112
01:20:03,245 --> 01:20:06,317
I'll tell you what I did it with.
I'll tell you how I...

1113
01:20:06,565 --> 01:20:09,204
Hold on just a goddamn second,
all right?

1114
01:20:09,445 --> 01:20:11,037
One step at a time.

1115
01:20:11,365 --> 01:20:13,356
I took an oath to uphold the law.

1116
01:20:13,605 --> 01:20:15,721
I came here
to bring in the bad guy.

1117
01:20:15,965 --> 01:20:18,433
Generally, that's what I do.

1118
01:20:26,725 --> 01:20:29,398
You asked me how many times
I read your letter.

1119
01:20:30,365 --> 01:20:32,959
I must've read it about
1000 times.

1120
01:20:34,525 --> 01:20:38,564
It was your letter that
brought me here. It was you.

1121
01:20:40,485 --> 01:20:43,283
And I'm all mixed-up about that.

1122
01:20:51,165 --> 01:20:53,918
The reason you're here
and you don't know why...

1123
01:20:54,165 --> 01:20:56,076
...is because I sent for you.

1124
01:20:59,365 --> 01:21:01,276
When I was a little girl...

1125
01:21:03,725 --> 01:21:05,556
...I worked a spell...

1126
01:21:07,165 --> 01:21:09,235
...so I would never fall in love.

1127
01:21:11,125 --> 01:21:15,357
I asked for qualities in a man
that I knew couldn't possibly exist.

1128
01:21:16,965 --> 01:21:18,683
One green eye, one...

1129
01:21:18,965 --> 01:21:20,000
...blue?

1130
01:21:23,325 --> 01:21:24,963
But you do.

1131
01:21:27,565 --> 01:21:30,125
You're saying
what I'm feeling is just...

1132
01:21:30,485 --> 01:21:31,679
...one of your spells?

1133
01:21:32,565 --> 01:21:34,476
Yeah. It's not real.

1134
01:21:36,125 --> 01:21:40,357
If you stay, I wouldn't know
if it was because of the spell...

1135
01:21:41,365 --> 01:21:44,755
...and you wouldn't know if it was
because I didn't want to go to prison.

1136
01:21:51,165 --> 01:21:53,395
You know, all relationships
have problems.

1137
01:22:00,405 --> 01:22:01,963
I'm right, aren't I?

1138
01:22:04,445 --> 01:22:06,083
You don't know, do you?

1139
01:22:14,485 --> 01:22:16,874
Why don't you do what you do...

1140
01:22:17,125 --> 01:22:19,081
...and I do what I do...

1141
01:22:21,085 --> 01:22:23,235
...and we'll see where we end up.

1142
01:22:32,765 --> 01:22:35,837
Curses only have power
when you believe in them.

1143
01:22:37,125 --> 01:22:38,763
And I don't.

1144
01:22:43,125 --> 01:22:44,399
You know what?

1145
01:22:47,765 --> 01:22:49,676
I wished for you too.

1146
01:23:42,005 --> 01:23:46,044
I'm feeling very
into sisters right now.

1147
01:23:58,965 --> 01:24:00,239
Come on.

1148
01:24:00,925 --> 01:24:01,721
Oh, dear.

1149
01:24:02,205 --> 01:24:04,321
It seems we've not arrived
in the nick of time.

1150
01:24:06,325 --> 01:24:09,044
I see our instincts are getting
a little rusty.

1151
01:24:09,285 --> 01:24:11,196
He's squatting inside her
like a toad.

1152
01:24:11,445 --> 01:24:13,515
This is what comes from dabbling.

1153
01:24:13,765 --> 01:24:16,438
You can't practice witchcraft
while you look down your nose at it.

1154
01:24:16,685 --> 01:24:17,401
I know.

1155
01:24:17,645 --> 01:24:19,078
I know.

1156
01:24:19,845 --> 01:24:21,756
Just tell me what to do
and I'll do it.

1157
01:24:22,085 --> 01:24:25,361
- We must banish him.
- Force his spirit back to the grave.

1158
01:24:25,605 --> 01:24:27,800
- We need a full coven.
- Nine women.

1159
01:24:28,125 --> 01:24:29,558
Twelve's better.

1160
01:24:30,605 --> 01:24:32,163
Do you have any friends?

1161
01:24:33,365 --> 01:24:34,161
Linda!

1162
01:24:34,405 --> 01:24:35,440
It's Sally.

1163
01:24:35,685 --> 01:24:37,277
I'm activating the phone tree.

1164
01:24:37,525 --> 01:24:40,244
You know the stuff everyone
whispers about me...

1165
01:24:40,485 --> 01:24:41,998
...the hexes, the spells?

1166
01:24:42,245 --> 01:24:43,519
Well, here's the thing.

1167
01:24:44,125 --> 01:24:44,955
I'm a witch!

1168
01:24:45,605 --> 01:24:47,197
I got the best news.

1169
01:24:47,445 --> 01:24:49,754
Sally just came out.

1170
01:24:50,365 --> 01:24:52,674
What a fabulous affirmation.

1171
01:24:52,925 --> 01:24:55,803
Her sister just got out of
a bad relationship...

1172
01:24:56,045 --> 01:24:58,320
...and now the guy
won't leave her alone.

1173
01:25:23,445 --> 01:25:25,515
Oh, can you bring a broom?

1174
01:25:54,845 --> 01:25:57,643
- I see headlights.
- Mom, they're here!

1175
01:25:58,245 --> 01:26:00,122
Come on! They're here!

1176
01:26:01,245 --> 01:26:02,997
It's in the kitchen!
In the side door!

1177
01:26:04,285 --> 01:26:07,243
Come in!
It's so good of you to come.

1178
01:26:08,285 --> 01:26:10,753
No, now's not the time to be shy.
Come on in.

1179
01:26:11,005 --> 01:26:14,281
Grab yourselves a spoon.
You can stir right over there.

1180
01:26:16,165 --> 01:26:20,477
You get right over here and grab
that spoon and dig right in.

1181
01:26:20,725 --> 01:26:22,522
Doesn't that look great?

1182
01:26:22,805 --> 01:26:25,399
And the fumes are great for the pores.

1183
01:26:25,725 --> 01:26:29,479
Not to mention sealing his nasty
spirit back into the grave.

1184
01:26:29,925 --> 01:26:32,439
Once, I was across town,
my daughter had a nightmare.

1185
01:26:32,685 --> 01:26:35,358
I swear, I could hear her crying.

1186
01:26:35,605 --> 01:26:37,482
There's a little witch in all of us.

1187
01:26:38,205 --> 01:26:40,400
Everything's almost ready, Aunt Jet.

1188
01:26:44,245 --> 01:26:45,758
I didn't expect you here.

1189
01:26:46,005 --> 01:26:50,123
Ever since I was a little girl,
I've wanted to see inside your house.

1190
01:26:50,525 --> 01:26:52,117
Thank you for coming.

1191
01:26:52,325 --> 01:26:53,201
Is this okay?

1192
01:26:53,445 --> 01:26:55,037
It's all I had.

1193
01:26:56,205 --> 01:26:57,877
Ladies, let's begin.

1194
01:27:01,805 --> 01:27:04,273
All right, ladies, pick a broom.

1195
01:27:04,525 --> 01:27:05,844
Form a circle.

1196
01:27:06,085 --> 01:27:07,279
Holy shit!

1197
01:27:11,965 --> 01:27:15,196
I've been strung out
by a guy before, but this...

1198
01:27:23,645 --> 01:27:25,317
Each of you
pick up your brooms.

1199
01:27:25,805 --> 01:27:27,284
Hold them at staff length...

1200
01:27:28,485 --> 01:27:30,237
...handle to brush.

1201
01:27:32,245 --> 01:27:34,281
Remember that as we go forth...

1202
01:27:34,525 --> 01:27:36,595
...it is only with our hearts
beating as one...

1203
01:27:36,845 --> 01:27:39,200
...that we can save the life
of this child.

1204
01:27:55,805 --> 01:27:58,114
Are we supposed to say this?

1205
01:28:42,005 --> 01:28:43,404
Stop it. Stop it!

1206
01:28:43,725 --> 01:28:45,204
We're killing her!

1207
01:28:52,325 --> 01:28:54,839
Fight this, you bitch!

1208
01:29:02,605 --> 01:29:04,163
Oh, God! Oh, God!

1209
01:29:04,405 --> 01:29:06,202
Gilly! Gilly, honey!

1210
01:29:07,885 --> 01:29:09,682
It's okay. I love you.

1211
01:29:16,365 --> 01:29:17,957
Stay with me.

1212
01:29:21,405 --> 01:29:22,758
Please.

1213
01:29:24,685 --> 01:29:27,358
Please, just let him take me.

1214
01:29:28,165 --> 01:29:29,757
No, you have to hold on.

1215
01:29:30,005 --> 01:29:32,121
Gill, you have to stay with me.

1216
01:29:33,805 --> 01:29:35,841
Gilly. No, stay with me.

1217
01:29:36,085 --> 01:29:37,757
Gilly, stay with me.

1218
01:29:38,605 --> 01:29:39,924
He wants...

1219
01:29:40,165 --> 01:29:41,393
...me.

1220
01:29:41,645 --> 01:29:43,124
Just me.

1221
01:29:43,365 --> 01:29:44,514
No.

1222
01:29:45,565 --> 01:29:47,999
Everyone will be safe.

1223
01:29:49,045 --> 01:29:50,160
Just let him...

1224
01:29:50,365 --> 01:29:51,559
...take me.

1225
01:29:57,725 --> 01:30:00,114
Don't die on me, Gilly Owens, please.

1226
01:30:00,365 --> 01:30:03,323
Because we're supposed
to die together, remember?

1227
01:30:03,565 --> 01:30:04,475
The same time.

1228
01:30:04,725 --> 01:30:07,603
You promised me that.
And this is not that day.

1229
01:30:08,445 --> 01:30:10,356
I love you, Sally.

1230
01:30:15,685 --> 01:30:16,515
Okay, wait.

1231
01:30:16,765 --> 01:30:19,404
I've got it.
Get them back in the circle.

1232
01:30:41,045 --> 01:30:44,162
Hey, Jimmy, I got a worm
with your name on it.

1233
01:30:50,525 --> 01:30:51,844
You thirsty?

1234
01:31:04,205 --> 01:31:05,763
Is this what you want?

1235
01:31:06,205 --> 01:31:07,433
Well, this...

1236
01:31:07,685 --> 01:31:09,164
...you can't have.

1237
01:31:13,165 --> 01:31:14,393
My blood.

1238
01:31:15,005 --> 01:31:15,881
Your blood.

1239
01:31:16,125 --> 01:31:16,796
Our blood!

1240
01:31:17,045 --> 01:31:18,080
Maria's blood. Now!

1241
01:31:18,405 --> 01:31:19,679
Push her in.

1242
01:31:35,565 --> 01:31:36,600
I love you, Gillian.

1243
01:31:55,245 --> 01:31:56,155
We did it!

1244
01:31:57,645 --> 01:31:59,363
Heads up, ladies.

1245
01:32:00,165 --> 01:32:01,314
Ashes to ashes...

1246
01:32:01,565 --> 01:32:03,044
...dust to dust.

1247
01:32:07,645 --> 01:32:11,035
I wonder if that would work
on my ex-husband?

1248
01:32:11,285 --> 01:32:12,559
Come on, ladies...

1249
01:32:12,805 --> 01:32:14,841
...let's clean house!

1250
01:32:15,845 --> 01:32:17,437
Get him out of here!

1251
01:32:17,765 --> 01:32:18,993
Come along, ladies.

1252
01:32:19,245 --> 01:32:20,360
Through the kitchen!

1253
01:32:21,725 --> 01:32:22,999
Follow me!

1254
01:32:23,245 --> 01:32:24,644
Well done!

1255
01:32:27,485 --> 01:32:29,555
Sweep him to the roses.

1256
01:33:14,245 --> 01:33:16,156
There's something for you.

1257
01:33:17,765 --> 01:33:19,198
From Arizona.

1258
01:33:31,205 --> 01:33:34,197
"Dear Miss Owens:
Any further investigations...

1259
01:33:34,805 --> 01:33:38,241
Office hereby concluded
James Angelov's cause of death was...

1260
01:33:39,005 --> 01:33:40,358
...accidental.

1261
01:33:41,565 --> 01:33:45,353
Jewelry in ashes of structure
provided positive identification.

1262
01:33:45,605 --> 01:33:47,323
Sincerely, Gary Hallet...

1263
01:33:47,565 --> 01:33:49,396
...Special Investigator. "

1264
01:33:52,525 --> 01:33:54,516
I don't think he's in there.

1265
01:34:01,245 --> 01:34:02,837
What would you do?

1266
01:34:04,485 --> 01:34:06,157
What wouldn't I do...

1267
01:34:06,405 --> 01:34:08,043
...for the right guy?

1268
01:35:22,525 --> 01:35:25,961
Can love travel back in time
and heal a broken heart?

1269
01:35:27,045 --> 01:35:30,276
Was it our joined hands that
finally lifted Maria 's curse?

1270
01:35:31,645 --> 01:35:33,715
I'd like to think so.

1271
01:35:36,205 --> 01:35:38,844
There are some things
I know for certain:

1272
01:35:39,405 --> 01:35:42,238
Always throw spilled salt
over your left shoulder.

1273
01:35:43,045 --> 01:35:45,161
Keep rosemary by your garden gate.

1274
01:35:45,405 --> 01:35:47,282
Plant lavender for luck.

1275
01:35:47,525 --> 01:35:49,516
And fall in love whenever you can.

1276
