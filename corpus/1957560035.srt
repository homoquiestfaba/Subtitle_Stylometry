1
00:00:01,779 --> 00:00:05,529
(slow soft orchestral music)

2
00:00:55,749 --> 00:00:58,582
(hooves clopping)

3
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:14,931
(crickets chirping)

4
00:01:14,931 --> 00:01:17,598
(thunder rolls)

5
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:32,730
(horse whinnies)

6
00:01:35,946 --> 00:01:40,946
(thunder rolls)
(birds chirping)

7
00:01:49,188 --> 00:01:51,438
(cow moos)

8
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:58,967
(knocking on door)

9
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:02,630
- Good morning, sir.

10
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:07,170
I represent Wells & Benton's
Seeds & Shrubs of Cincinnati.

11
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:08,970
Thought you might need
something from our catalog.

12
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:10,610
- You got russets and vandermen?

13
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:11,443
- Oh, yes, sir.

14
00:02:11,443 --> 00:02:14,520
Cuttings, root balls,
even fruit-bearing trees.

15
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,520
Best prices in Ohio.
- You give credit?

16
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,500
- Yes, that might be arranged.

17
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,333
- Step on in.

18
00:02:21,276 --> 00:02:23,693
(cow mooing)

19
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:32,930
- So that'll be a
half-dozen russet seedlings,

20
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:36,110
and a dozen vandermen root balls.

21
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:38,190
Is that right, Mr. Chilton?

22
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:41,763
Sir?
- Mm hm.

23
00:02:44,296 --> 00:02:49,296
(birds chirping)
(slow soft music)

24
00:02:49,616 --> 00:02:52,199
(wood clamors)

25
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,250
Here, miss, let me help.

26
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,440
- Get outta here!

27
00:03:04,428 --> 00:03:07,261
(slow soft music)

28
00:03:10,504 --> 00:03:13,100
(cow moos)

29
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,250
You can be on your way.

30
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,490
Changed my mind, I don't want nothin'.

31
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:21,472
(hand slaps)

32
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:22,305
- [Woman] Ow!

33
00:03:22,305 --> 00:03:23,730
- What the hell you think you're doing?

34
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:25,630
Sacheting around him, you get to work!

35
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:35,413
You still here?

36
00:03:36,304 --> 00:03:38,580
- You got no business treatin'
her like that, mister.

37
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:40,370
I don't care if she's kin of yours or not.

38
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:41,990
- I asked you civil once.

39
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:45,460
You want me to get my gun?

40
00:03:52,794 --> 00:03:55,627
(slow soft music)

41
00:03:58,185 --> 00:04:00,935
(birds chirping)

42
00:04:07,298 --> 00:04:12,298
(carriage rattling)
(hooves clopping)

43
00:04:17,518 --> 00:04:18,601
- Whoa, whoa.

44
00:04:25,681 --> 00:04:28,181
(cows mooing)

45
00:04:38,688 --> 00:04:41,355
(bell clanging)

46
00:04:52,372 --> 00:04:56,096
(knocking on door)

47
00:04:56,096 --> 00:04:59,317
- Uh, I left my order book
here, somewhere in the kitchen.

48
00:05:04,175 --> 00:05:06,140
(door closes)

49
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,510
You related?

50
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:08,343
- No kin.

51
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:11,900
Once he finds you here,
he'll kill us both.

52
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:15,360
- Oh, he don't scare me.

53
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:19,170
You beholden to him?

54
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:20,470
- I ain't no way beholden.

55
00:05:21,469 --> 00:05:23,910
(laughs)

56
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:25,110
We don't have much time.

57
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:27,470
You best say your piece.

58
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,480
- My name is Thomas Linthorne.

59
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,530
- Mine's Kate Harewell.

60
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:33,420
- Couple of months ago I
bought a small, abandoned farm

61
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:34,610
a few days south of here.

62
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:36,080
It cost me everything I got.

63
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,780
I was doing this job just
to get a little ahead

64
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:39,620
before I moved down there,

65
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:41,960
but if you're willing to work it with me,

66
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,060
I guess I'm ready now.

67
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:46,240
- You're asking me to go with you?

68
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:49,610
- I'm asking you to marry.

69
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:50,730
- You are?

70
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:54,040
- I ain't lookin' for a work
horse, don't take me wrong.

71
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,790
- Don't you worry about me workin'.

72
00:05:56,747 --> 00:05:59,240
- I just know when I saw you
I wanted you for my wife.

73
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,530
- Come for me tonight.

74
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:06,265
Sleeps so drunk, won't nothin' wake him.

75
00:06:06,265 --> 00:06:09,182
(thunder rumbling)

76
00:06:11,878 --> 00:06:16,878
Shh!

77
00:06:21,751 --> 00:06:23,747
- Heeyah, heeyah!

78
00:06:23,747 --> 00:06:26,845
Yah, heeyah!

79
00:06:26,845 --> 00:06:29,781
(slow dramatic music)
(thunder rolling)

80
00:06:29,781 --> 00:06:32,448
(Kate laughing)

81
00:06:40,772 --> 00:06:43,772
(crickets chirping)

82
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:47,063
Sleepy?

83
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,010
- Not sleepy but I'm awful cold.

84
00:06:53,942 --> 00:06:56,042
- We're far enough away, I'll make a fire.

85
00:07:02,061 --> 00:07:03,560
(crickets chirping)
(birds singing)

86
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,160
- Who are you, Thomas Linthorne?

87
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:09,650
- Well, my mama was a
kitchenmaid down in Germantown

88
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:10,900
for the Linthorne family.

89
00:07:12,645 --> 00:07:13,695
She died birthin' me.

90
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:16,860
They let the cook raise me up

91
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:19,810
till I started lookin' an awful
lot like old man Linthorne.

92
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:24,110
Mrs. Linthorne, she gave me
$10 and told me I had to go.

93
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:29,260
I joined up for Mr. Lincoln
the day the fired on Sumpter.

94
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,610
Been lookin' for a farm for myself

95
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,600
since the day they mustered me up.

96
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:46,920
You sure you wanna be a farmer's wife?

97
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:49,490
- You won't be wondering what went on

98
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:51,940
in that house of Rancey
until it makes you crazy?

99
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:57,050
Best all around if you know now.

100
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:00,430
You don't wanna marry up after that, well,

101
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,730
you're not beholden.

102
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:04,563
- What happened?

103
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,560
- Caught me in the swimmin' hole one day.

104
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:12,900
Said he was goin' to town
but he didn't go to town.

105
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:15,840
Afterward, I opened up
his skull with a rock.

106
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:18,830
Hasn't come near me since.

107
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:24,210
He knew if he did, I'd
kill him in his sleep.

108
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:30,070
Scarlet fever took away my
whole family when I was nine.

109
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:34,030
Rancey and his mother took me in.

110
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:36,430
They weren't too bad,
till Rancey's mother died.

111
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:40,040
Don't make no difference.

112
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:47,720
- Oh, you are the most beautiful thing

113
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,400
I've ever seen in my life.

114
00:08:52,461 --> 00:08:54,544
(laughs)

115
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:59,010
I never thought I could
have a woman like you.

116
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:00,860
- You can have me if you want me, Thomas.

117
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:06,320
Don't think I'm gonna hit you with a rock.

118
00:09:08,698 --> 00:09:13,698
(slow soft music)
(crickets chirping)

119
00:09:16,581 --> 00:09:18,437
- [Thomas] Morning.

120
00:09:18,437 --> 00:09:22,760
- [Woman] Good day.

121
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,910
- Guess you wanted
Lutheran, don't you, Kate?

122
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:28,940
- They do say Lutherans tie awful tight.

123
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:31,067
- Then they'll be Lutheran.

124
00:09:31,067 --> 00:09:33,167
I don't want any slipknots in this family.

125
00:09:36,443 --> 00:09:38,460
(speaks in foreign language)

126
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:39,510
We wanna get married.

127
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:44,070
How much does it cost?

128
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:45,020
- You are Lutheran?

129
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:47,370
- Is it cheaper for Lutherans?

130
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:50,950
(speaks in foreign language)

131
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:52,980
- He don't (speaks in foreign
language) much English.

132
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:55,729
50 cent.

133
00:09:55,729 --> 00:09:58,458
- Okay, tell him to go ahead.

134
00:09:58,458 --> 00:10:02,208
(speaks in foreign language)

135
00:10:06,088 --> 00:10:06,921
- Ya, ya.

136
00:10:08,509 --> 00:10:09,868
- Ya.

137
00:10:09,868 --> 00:10:13,618
(speaks in foreign language)

138
00:10:16,181 --> 00:10:17,014
- Yes.

139
00:10:18,436 --> 00:10:21,436
(crickets chirping)

140
00:10:25,954 --> 00:10:29,704
(speaks in foreign language)

141
00:10:31,834 --> 00:10:33,917
- The ring forever means.

142
00:10:35,793 --> 00:10:38,626
(slow soft music)

143
00:10:40,597 --> 00:10:43,014
- You better kiss me, Thomas.

144
00:10:46,769 --> 00:10:49,602
(slow soft music)

145
00:10:55,435 --> 00:10:59,435
(lighthearted triumphant music)

146
00:11:09,256 --> 00:11:12,256
(people chattering)

147
00:11:26,224 --> 00:11:27,057
- Whoa.

148
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:33,518
(horse whinnies)
Here we are.

149
00:11:33,518 --> 00:11:34,960
(panting) I've been driving by this place

150
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:38,390
the last five years, hopin'
no one would see what I see

151
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:39,940
till I had the money to buy it.

152
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:45,730
And here I am, with my wife in my arms.

153
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:48,890
It's a wonder, ain't it,
Kate, how things work out?

154
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:50,470
Now you gotta look past all this ruin,

155
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:53,110
it ain't been worked in the last 10 years.

156
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:55,340
Look at the swell to that land.

157
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:59,780
It's like, it's like a
woman's breast. (laughs)

158
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:05,049
- (laughs) I guess you can
say that to your own wife,

159
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:09,107
so long as it's her breast
it puts you in mind of.

160
00:12:09,107 --> 00:12:11,230
- (laughs) It does at that.

161
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,063
Come on!

162
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,150
That's all black loam
risin' up to the hills,

163
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:18,290
waitin' to be put to the plow.

164
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:20,460
We work like slaves, we'll
have the ground broken,

165
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:22,810
crop of corn in the first year.

166
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:25,020
You know what a man can
accomplish in this country

167
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:28,044
with a little piece of
good land and hard work?

168
00:12:28,044 --> 00:12:29,450
I watched old man Linthorne do it.

169
00:12:33,379 --> 00:12:35,962
(Thomas sighs)

170
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,440
See that rise up there?

171
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,450
They call it Church Hill.

172
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:46,130
I don't know who owns it,

173
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:47,130
but one day I will.

174
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:49,703
We will.

175
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:52,180
We'll call it Linthorne Hill.

176
00:12:53,707 --> 00:12:56,707
(crickets chirping)

177
00:13:02,402 --> 00:13:04,985
(doves cooing)

178
00:13:10,507 --> 00:13:14,653
(Kate screaming and laughing)

179
00:13:14,653 --> 00:13:16,506
What do you think, Mrs. Linthorne?

180
00:13:16,506 --> 00:13:17,884
(Kate sighs)

181
00:13:17,884 --> 00:13:20,334
- (sighs) It's gonna be
a beautiful home, Thomas.

182
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:25,495
And with God's grace, we're
gonna fill it with children.

183
00:13:25,495 --> 00:13:28,328
(slow soft music)

184
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:32,430
(people chattering)

185
00:13:37,621 --> 00:13:39,170
(laughs) Thomas, I can't.
- Okay.

186
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:44,120
(slow soft music)

187
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:47,140
Don't know if you should
be makin' this trip

188
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:49,030
to town anymore, Kate.

189
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:49,990
- [Kate] Don't you worry,

190
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:52,050
he's tougher than that, Thomas.

191
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:54,840
Takes after his papa.
- You sure it's a boy?

192
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,170
- [Kate] Has to be the way he kicks.

193
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:57,760
- God knows I could use him.

194
00:13:59,509 --> 00:14:01,630
(slow soft music)

195
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:03,690
- [Kate] Looks like Mr. Vitt.

196
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:04,650
- [Thomas] You know him?

197
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:05,800
- He's in church every Sunday,

198
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,560
like everyone around here, except you.

199
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,630
- Oh now don't start, Kate.

200
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:11,650
- You're the one who talks
about being respectable.

201
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:13,470
Folks don't know what to make of you?

202
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:15,120
- Well what business is it of anyone else

203
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,820
if a man has doubts about things?

204
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:25,530
- Hello, Mr. Vitt.
- Howdy, ma'am.

205
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:30,460
- [Kate] Thank you.

206
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:32,560
- Well, this old place is sure lookin' up.

207
00:14:34,011 --> 00:14:37,030
I'm Spence Vitt, got a
place on Goose Ridge,

208
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:38,300
quarter mile up the road.

209
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:40,420
We share a fence on your back line.

210
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:41,790
- How do you do, Mr. Vitt?

211
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:42,940
Thomas Linthorne.

212
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:44,580
- Yes, sir.

213
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:46,835
Well I hope I'm not intrudin' here.

214
00:14:46,835 --> 00:14:48,170
- I'll go ahead and make some tea.

215
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,500
- I been meaning to
come over and visit you,

216
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:55,050
I got some things in
my wagon you might use.

217
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:56,030
Some harrows.

218
00:14:57,388 --> 00:14:59,317
The drag, planter, odds & ends.

219
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:03,420
- You certain you can spare all this?

220
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:05,910
- I'm settin' my land to
fruit, don't need it no more.

221
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:06,770
- Fruit?

222
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:08,850
Folks grow corn and wheat around here.

223
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:10,650
- I planted wheat and corn all my life,

224
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:13,314
my folks before me, I'm
bored to death of it.

225
00:15:13,314 --> 00:15:14,820
(Thomas laughs)

226
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,360
- [Thomas] Well, I'm grateful to you

227
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,850
for your kindness, Mr. Vitt.

228
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:21,060
- I'll help you unload here.

229
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:25,070
You know, I been watchin'
whatcha been doin' here.

230
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:26,830
You're doing a damn fine job.

231
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:33,840
That's Celia Sipooni.

232
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:36,640
She and Bill are your
neighbors across the creek.

233
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,540
- Bit odd lookin'.

234
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:40,430
- Folks say they eat rats.

235
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:42,130
I don't know for certain.

236
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:44,390
I've only seen 'em at table once or twice,

237
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:48,190
but I'm sure what they was
eatin' wasn't squirrel.

238
00:15:49,419 --> 00:15:52,730
(birds chirping)

239
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:53,710
- Guess you're sorta wonderin'

240
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:55,940
what in ever I come over here for.

241
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:56,840
- Sakes alive, no.

242
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:00,390
I been meaning to get out
visitin' our neighbors,

243
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:01,700
but there's always so much to do

244
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,740
and with the baby comin',
I just keep puttin' off

245
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:04,690
and putting it off.

246
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:10,722
You must think we're downright unsociable.

247
00:16:10,722 --> 00:16:12,890
- Oh, I seen you cross the crick,

248
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:14,760
workin' just as hard as your man.

249
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,420
Told my Bill I best
not wait for an invite.

250
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:19,990
Well, especially since I
seen Spence Vitt was here.

251
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:22,240
He's a strange one, he is.

252
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:25,330
Livin' by himself and never marryin'.

253
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:27,330
Got the devil for company if you ask me.

254
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:30,540
Thought I better warn
you 'fore it's too late.

255
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,260
- About Mr. Vitt?

256
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:35,900
- Spence?

257
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,930
No, your baby.

258
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:40,890
You don't want that
precious young one of yours

259
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:45,190
to come out marked now, do ya?

260
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:46,030
- Marked?

261
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:48,380
- Down Sugar Grove Way
there's this big woman there

262
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:51,770
named Schoonover, had
a brat most every year.

263
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:54,840
Trouble was the goin' after
the plow all day long,

264
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,840
she looked too much at the horse's tail.

265
00:16:58,466 --> 00:17:00,120
You know what happened?

266
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:03,560
Every one of that woman's kids
was born with a hairy lip.

267
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:06,227
(Kate laughing)

268
00:17:08,589 --> 00:17:10,089
- I heard of things like that.

269
00:17:11,783 --> 00:17:13,610
- You got to be awful careful.

270
00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:15,950
You don't never look at nothin' bad,

271
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:17,450
not even the least little bit.

272
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:21,010
That's pretty, that picture
of them roses over there

273
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:22,130
by the stove.

274
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:25,235
You stand and look at that
a couple hours each day.

275
00:17:25,235 --> 00:17:27,660
(door rattling)
What's that?

276
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,040
When your time comes,

277
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,790
you stick your head out
the window and holler.

278
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:37,599
I'll be there, at your side,

279
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:39,770
to bring your baby into
this sorry old world.

280
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,190
- Spence tells me she run
around all last winter

281
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:51,570
in a coat made out of rat skins.

282
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,800
And her husband, he's worse.

283
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,450
He's the one who caught the rats.

284
00:17:56,330 --> 00:17:57,330
- That's awful to say.

285
00:17:57,330 --> 00:17:59,860
- Oh, I'm sparin' you what's awful.

286
00:18:00,934 --> 00:18:04,017
(lighthearted music)

287
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:12,310
Mr. Holmes, trade you
a pig for a baby bed?

288
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:14,150
- [Mr. Holmes] You got
yourself a deal, Thomas.

289
00:18:15,187 --> 00:18:20,187
(lighthearted music)
(people chattering)

290
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:29,583
(crickets chirping)

291
00:18:31,858 --> 00:18:34,079
- [Thomas] Whoa!

292
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:36,829
(horse whinnies)

293
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:41,670
- [Spence] That's Goram Schrader,

294
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:43,940
he got a place the other
side of Church Hill.

295
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,190
- Church Hill?

296
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:47,080
Belongs to him?

297
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:50,910
- Well, he acts like it does but it don't.

298
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:52,860
Bank's owned it for 20 years,

299
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:54,610
ever since old man Chenowith died.

300
00:18:55,799 --> 00:18:58,140
- He wants it so bad, why don't he buy it?

301
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:00,530
- Well, so far he ain't had no reason to.

302
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:04,100
- Well, I'm not lookin' for a fight.

303
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:06,190
But to my way of thinkin',
a man pays for something,

304
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:07,350
it belongs to him;

305
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:08,860
he don't pay for it, it don't.

306
00:19:09,785 --> 00:19:12,420
- Well, best if you just go your own way

307
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:13,590
and let Goram go his.

308
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:18,170
Same as if you had a grizzly
bear cross your path.

309
00:19:20,451 --> 00:19:23,790
(birds chirping)
(wind blowing)

310
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:24,623
- Mr. Linthorne.

311
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:29,260
Well, you best get on up
to your wife in there,

312
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:30,093
Mr. Linthorne.

313
00:19:31,883 --> 00:19:34,466
(men laughing)

314
00:19:36,415 --> 00:19:39,170
- Don't waste no time on me, get up there!

315
00:19:41,149 --> 00:19:43,982
(slow soft music)

316
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:49,160
- Come meet your son, Thomas.

317
00:19:51,371 --> 00:19:52,204
- Oh.

318
00:19:53,779 --> 00:19:57,362
(Thomas breathing heavily)

319
00:19:59,617 --> 00:20:02,290
(laughs)

320
00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:04,337
Come on, you won't break him.

321
00:20:05,618 --> 00:20:08,451
(slow soft music)

322
00:20:11,796 --> 00:20:15,085
(Kate chuckles)

323
00:20:15,085 --> 00:20:17,585
(baby cooing)

324
00:20:22,354 --> 00:20:25,620
Can we name him Hocking, Thomas?

325
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:27,470
I always hoped to remember my father.

326
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:31,270
- More than I can say for my old man.

327
00:20:32,531 --> 00:20:34,560
(laughs)

328
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,070
Hocking Linthorne it is.

329
00:20:37,473 --> 00:20:40,306
(slow soft music)

330
00:20:52,202 --> 00:20:53,035
Oh.

331
00:20:55,491 --> 00:20:56,906
(Kate sighs)

332
00:20:56,906 --> 00:20:59,080
You see that, boy?

333
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,490
You were born with land.

334
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:03,780
Just like a lord.

335
00:21:08,299 --> 00:21:09,550
(Thomas grunting)

336
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:12,133
(birds cawing)

337
00:21:22,081 --> 00:21:22,914
Oh.

338
00:21:25,126 --> 00:21:26,900
- Don't know what you have against it.

339
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:29,510
- I don't have anything against it, Kate.

340
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:32,940
I wish I understood it is all.

341
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:37,200
Don't seem likely to me

342
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,930
that God's up there watchin' to see

343
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:42,150
that Hocking gets a
little water on his head.

344
00:21:44,497 --> 00:21:45,972
(baby cooing)

345
00:21:45,972 --> 00:21:48,210
- Weren't you baptized?

346
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:49,823
- I guess.

347
00:21:49,823 --> 00:21:52,065
But it ain't help me see any proof

348
00:21:52,065 --> 00:21:53,165
of all that's claimed.

349
00:21:55,770 --> 00:21:56,820
- I prayed, Thomas.

350
00:21:58,690 --> 00:21:59,940
I prayed and I prayed.

351
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:03,580
God sent you to me and
that's proof enough for me.

352
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:07,750
- All I know is I got
lost off the main road,

353
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:09,800
rode up to Rancey's house to try my luck.

354
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:14,420
What happened happened because
we wanted it to happen.

355
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,000
- What do you believe in, Thomas?

356
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,580
- Well, when it comes to God, (sighs)

357
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:24,930
seems like I don't understand any better

358
00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:26,230
than a rabbit down a hole.

359
00:22:28,397 --> 00:22:31,230
(slow soft music)

360
00:22:36,444 --> 00:22:40,310
- I don't believe you mean that, Thomas.

361
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:42,210
- (sighs) I don't know what I believe.

362
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,450
I don't understand how anyone does.

363
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:48,250
I believe in myself.

364
00:22:49,412 --> 00:22:51,190
(slow soft music)

365
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:52,023
I know that.

366
00:22:53,276 --> 00:22:55,776
(baby grunts)

367
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:59,837
(Kate sighs)

368
00:23:01,439 --> 00:23:05,547
(wind blowing)
(dog whimpering)

369
00:23:05,547 --> 00:23:07,214
- [Kate] Poor thing.

370
00:23:09,997 --> 00:23:13,440
- Oh, he looks like he's been whipped.

371
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,650
- Just needs a little carin' for.

372
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:17,722
- [Thomas] He belongs to someone, Kate.

373
00:23:17,722 --> 00:23:21,460
- Well, whoever he belongs
to has no right to him.

374
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:22,500
I wanna keep him.

375
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:26,330
- Well, I guess we should
clean his wounds for starters.

376
00:23:26,330 --> 00:23:27,800
Here boy, easy.

377
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:30,570
That's it.

378
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:32,756
Good boy.

379
00:23:32,756 --> 00:23:35,190
(dog whimpering)
(wind howling)

380
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:39,400
- I baptize thee,
Hocking Thomas Linthorne.

381
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,650
In the name of the Father, and of the Son,

382
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:45,960
and of the Holy Spirit.

383
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,520
- Reverend, I appreciate it.

384
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,722
- You're more than welcome, sir.

385
00:23:53,722 --> 00:23:55,150
(people chattering)

386
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:56,110
- Well, Linthorne.

387
00:23:57,290 --> 00:24:00,260
Got yourself a brat, do we? (laughs)

388
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:02,980
- Got myself a son, Mr. Tannersham.

389
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:04,710
- Better hope you can pay his keep

390
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:07,590
outta that little place of yours.

391
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:09,420
- I'm hoping to pay his keep,

392
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:11,470
and a few more besides.

393
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:13,070
Good day to you, Mr. Tannersham.

394
00:24:14,722 --> 00:24:18,265
(people chattering)

395
00:24:18,265 --> 00:24:20,765
(baby cooing)

396
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:25,440
- Don't mind Luke.

397
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:29,410
He's just accustomed to being
the richest man in the valley.

398
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:30,920
- So what call's he got insultin' me

399
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,490
on the day of my boy's baptism?

400
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:35,120
- He knows you gonna be richer.

401
00:24:36,547 --> 00:24:38,952
(Thomas chuckles)

402
00:24:38,952 --> 00:24:41,663
- Come on, come to mom.

403
00:24:41,663 --> 00:24:43,680
Here you go.

404
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:46,182
Come on.

405
00:24:46,182 --> 00:24:48,577
(leaves rustling)

406
00:24:48,577 --> 00:24:51,160
(birds cawing)

407
00:24:58,351 --> 00:25:00,630
(dog barking)

408
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:02,115
(gun fires)

409
00:25:02,115 --> 00:25:04,448
(gun fires)

410
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:09,030
- What you doin' with my coon?

411
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:09,863
- Should've known it was you

412
00:25:09,863 --> 00:25:11,410
who would treat a dog like that.

413
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:14,650
He come to us, ain't yours no more.

414
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:17,100
- Worthless son of a bitch
can tree worth a damn.

415
00:25:18,455 --> 00:25:19,410
(dog barking)

416
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:20,243
He's all yourn.

417
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:22,720
You can have the rabbit, too.

418
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,420
- I was told this ain't your land.

419
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:26,770
Wouldn't be here if it was.

420
00:25:27,736 --> 00:25:29,670
(birds cawing)

421
00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:32,780
- Now you listen to me, you
dog-stealin' son of a bitch.

422
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:34,480
I been huntin' this hill
since I was old enough

423
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,330
to hold a gun.

424
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:36,640
My daddy hunted it before me.

425
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,670
My granddaddy was the first
white man in this valley.

426
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:42,240
I'm gonna go right on huntin' this hill

427
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,940
and no Johnny-come-lately
better get notion otherwise.

428
00:25:46,287 --> 00:25:49,454
(slow dramatic music)

429
00:25:53,033 --> 00:25:55,783
(birds chirping)

430
00:25:57,107 --> 00:25:58,300
- We better hurry, Thomas.

431
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:59,310
I don't wanna keep the children out

432
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:00,790
in this cold much longer.

433
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:01,870
- [Thomas] Just about done.

434
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:04,370
- I'm worried about old Lonzo Brewster.

435
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:06,300
He ain't even comin' to church anymore.

436
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:10,410
He won't make it through a
bad winter all by himself.

437
00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:13,260
- He hadn't been the same
since his boy Jim ran off.

438
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:16,140
Yeah, Lonz is a little
touched to the head now.

439
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:18,240
He wouldn't know if he was starved or not.

440
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,510
- I'll carry some vittles over to him.

441
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:23,310
- He won't take 'em, he's too proud.

442
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:26,790
Why don't I have a Christmas shoot?

443
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:28,830
We'll put a heifer up for a prize.

444
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:30,400
Lon's still a crack shot.

445
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,570
The rest of us could have
a little twitch that day.

446
00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:35,379
- We've had a good year.

447
00:26:35,379 --> 00:26:36,540
Let me put up the heifer.

448
00:26:38,154 --> 00:26:41,402
(slow soft music)

449
00:26:41,402 --> 00:26:42,485
- [Men] Whoa!

450
00:26:45,169 --> 00:26:47,273
- [Man] At the target, Ben.

451
00:26:47,273 --> 00:26:48,850
(gun fires)
- Lean miss.

452
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,150
- Lonzo, your turn now.

453
00:26:53,415 --> 00:26:55,282
(men laughing)

454
00:26:55,282 --> 00:26:56,865
- [Man] All right now, Lonzo.

455
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:57,698
Come on.

456
00:26:57,698 --> 00:27:02,017
Steady eye, Lonzo, steady eye.

457
00:27:02,017 --> 00:27:04,705
Come on now.

458
00:27:04,705 --> 00:27:07,964
(slow soft music)

459
00:27:07,964 --> 00:27:08,970
(gun fires)

460
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:10,550
(men cheering)
- Woo!

461
00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:12,074
(men chattering)

462
00:27:12,074 --> 00:27:14,116
Looks like Lon's the winner!

463
00:27:14,116 --> 00:27:19,116
(men cheering)
- Yahoo! (laughs)

464
00:27:19,592 --> 00:27:21,411
See this?

465
00:27:21,411 --> 00:27:23,450
That's my pappy's old gun.

466
00:27:26,003 --> 00:27:27,448
- [Man] That there's a fine gun.

467
00:27:27,448 --> 00:27:29,475
- Yahoo, ahoo, ahoo! (laughs)

468
00:27:29,475 --> 00:27:32,217
(men chattering)

469
00:27:32,217 --> 00:27:34,350
(cow moos)

470
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:38,540
I guess I won me that heifer. (laughs)

471
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:41,180
- One more to shoot.
(cow moos)

472
00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:49,910
(coin clinks)

473
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,293
(gun cocks)

474
00:27:59,397 --> 00:28:00,230
(gun fires)

475
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:01,110
- Bullseye.

476
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:02,660
- Guess that wins it, don't it?

477
00:28:03,654 --> 00:28:06,487
(slow soft music)

478
00:28:08,150 --> 00:28:11,424
- [Man] I knew that,

479
00:28:11,424 --> 00:28:14,320
just walkin' in here like that.

480
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:17,070
(men chattering)

481
00:28:18,174 --> 00:28:22,409
(slow somber music)
(cow moos)

482
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:25,159
(horse whinnies)

483
00:28:27,495 --> 00:28:28,400
- [Man] It's just not right.

484
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:35,330
- Anybody tell you why we had this shoot?

485
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:38,750
This heifer was meant for Lonzo.

486
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:40,260
- Man wants to be a fool with his stock,

487
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:42,310
that's his business, don't mean I have to.

488
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:43,830
- Seems you got a habit of layin' claim

489
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:45,590
to what ain't yours.

490
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:47,390
- I won this heifer fair and square.

491
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,120
Any man here wanna say I didn't?

492
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:52,620
- Oh, you won it.

493
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:55,050
There was nothin' square about it.

494
00:28:55,050 --> 00:28:55,883
Or neighborly.

495
00:28:58,570 --> 00:28:59,670
- Won it all the same.

496
00:29:00,899 --> 00:29:04,551
(slow somber music)

497
00:29:04,551 --> 00:29:05,727
(cow moos)

498
00:29:05,727 --> 00:29:07,330
- I thought for sure
he was gonna crack you

499
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:08,310
in two, Linthorne.

500
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:11,170
You don't know how lucky you were.

501
00:29:11,170 --> 00:29:14,110
- Seems to me Goram Schrader's
the one that backed off.

502
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:15,760
I never thought I'd see that day.

503
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:20,580
- [Hocking] Giddyup, come on.

504
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:21,780
Come on, giddyup horsey.

505
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:23,963
Yaw, yaw.

506
00:29:26,906 --> 00:29:27,739
- I'll be damned.

507
00:29:27,739 --> 00:29:28,800
I think he's plowin'.

508
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:32,330
- He's gonna be a farmer,
just like his papa.

509
00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:33,430
He adores you, Thomas.

510
00:29:37,050 --> 00:29:38,370
- [Hocking] Giddyup horsey.

511
00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:41,570
- What are you thinkin' on?

512
00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:43,780
- Oh, I always had this
idea of raisin' up a son

513
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:45,280
who'd go farther in the world,

514
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,060
an educated man.

515
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:50,040
Guess I've got to make a farmer of him.

516
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:52,050
- You don't sound like that pleases you.

517
00:29:52,050 --> 00:29:53,760
- Oh, it pleases me, Kate.

518
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,770
Of course it pleases me.
- Yaw, yaw!

519
00:29:58,012 --> 00:30:01,460
(slow soft music)

520
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:03,710
- The Linthornes always
had a big Christmas.

521
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:05,510
The clan would gather from all over.

522
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:11,050
I'd watch from the kitchen
when they opened the presents.

523
00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:13,050
Never got a present myself, as I recall.

524
00:30:14,872 --> 00:30:17,226
- (laughs) Can't recall I did either.

525
00:30:17,226 --> 00:30:19,010
(slow soft music)

526
00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:20,560
- Means everything to me, Kate.

527
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:23,350
Our havin' a Christmas of our own.

528
00:30:24,699 --> 00:30:27,532
(slow soft music)

529
00:30:37,242 --> 00:30:39,842
- (laughs) What's that you
got in your hand, Thomas?

530
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:44,937
- Something you should've
had, long before now.

531
00:30:45,954 --> 00:30:48,787
(slow soft music)

532
00:30:53,331 --> 00:30:54,164
- Thomas.

533
00:30:56,788 --> 00:30:58,680
(sighs) It's beautiful.

534
00:30:58,680 --> 00:30:59,810
- Look inside there.

535
00:30:59,810 --> 00:31:00,910
Got something written.

536
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:10,500
- "The ring forever means." (laughs)

537
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,820
- I could have it taken out
if you think it's foolish.

538
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:16,940
- You've done foolish
things before, Thomas.

539
00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:22,968
But not this.

540
00:31:22,968 --> 00:31:25,801
(slow soft music)

541
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:27,940
- [Man] Lordy it's nippy out.

542
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:29,470
- Morning, Mister-
- Morning, ma'am.

543
00:31:30,392 --> 00:31:33,392
(people chattering)

544
00:31:36,806 --> 00:31:37,639
(horse whinnies)

545
00:31:37,639 --> 00:31:39,410
- [Man] Whoa, come on,
hey, hey, hey, here we go.

546
00:31:39,410 --> 00:31:40,670
Here we go, here we go, that's it.

547
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:43,430
That's it, run up in there,
that's it, that's it.

548
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:44,620
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

549
00:31:45,667 --> 00:31:46,707
- [Man] Can you give me a hand later on?

550
00:31:46,707 --> 00:31:48,239
I gotta...

551
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:51,072
(slow soft music)

552
00:31:54,816 --> 00:31:55,649
(horse whinnies)

553
00:31:55,649 --> 00:31:58,040
- Bryan Briarly, sir, at your service.

554
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:00,110
Dealer in fine horses and livery.

555
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:02,900
You look like the kind of feller

556
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:04,300
that wants to go somewheres.

557
00:32:05,559 --> 00:32:07,420
(laughs) Wants to get there in a hurry.

558
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:08,253
Am I right?

559
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:09,993
Thought so.

560
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:12,750
This is Black Belle.

561
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:16,280
By Thunderbolt out of Jenny Beam.

562
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:19,180
Spittin' image of her daddy.

563
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:22,310
You've heard of Thunderbolt, haven't you?

564
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:24,410
Fastest horse ever raised up in West Ohio.

565
00:32:25,447 --> 00:32:26,620
(laughs) Oh, yes.

566
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:30,460
This right here is the best
filly I ever had on offer.

567
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:35,220
She'll be gone by sundown,
you can count on that.

568
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:40,760
- $350 and Winnie thrown in?

569
00:32:42,133 --> 00:32:43,430
(sighs) What've you done, Thomas?

570
00:32:44,468 --> 00:32:45,301
- We'll make the money on her

571
00:32:45,301 --> 00:32:47,650
when we put her to pasture and breed her.

572
00:32:47,650 --> 00:32:50,370
- Is it that important to ride
the best horse in the valley?

573
00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:53,200
- I have been workin'
like a beast of burden

574
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,630
every day since I brought
you on to this land.

575
00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:00,160
I don't regret a day of it.

576
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,430
But there's gotta be somethin',

577
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:03,460
somethin' I can have just for myself

578
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:06,980
for all this workin',
without accountin' to anyone.

579
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:07,820
Not even you.

580
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:13,130
- I guess I should be
grateful she's a horse.

581
00:33:13,130 --> 00:33:14,828
- I don't take your meaning.

582
00:33:14,828 --> 00:33:16,510
(lighthearted music)

583
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:17,510
- Enjoy her, Thomas.

584
00:33:21,199 --> 00:33:22,258
- [Thomas] Heeyah!

585
00:33:22,258 --> 00:33:25,675
(light triumphant music)

586
00:33:28,319 --> 00:33:29,152
Heeyah.

587
00:33:32,147 --> 00:33:33,397
Come on, girl.

588
00:33:34,268 --> 00:33:35,168
- Will you look at that?

589
00:33:35,168 --> 00:33:37,320
Flauntin' that new horse of his.

590
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:39,330
And on the Lord's day to boot.

591
00:33:39,330 --> 00:33:41,490
- Well, you'll put a word
for him in your prayers,

592
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:42,620
wont' you, Luke?

593
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:45,370
- I pray for Thomas Linthorne every day.

594
00:33:45,370 --> 00:33:46,470
- Come along, Hocking.

595
00:33:49,161 --> 00:33:51,911
(horse whinnies)

596
00:33:53,970 --> 00:33:55,720
Did you have to ride by the church?

597
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:58,860
- I didn't think about it.

598
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:00,980
- No, of course you didn't.

599
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:03,470
When have you ever givin' a
think to what anybody thought?

600
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:04,430
- What is it, Kate?

601
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:07,930
- You say you want people to respect you.

602
00:34:07,930 --> 00:34:09,770
You have to act respectably.

603
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:13,780
People look up to you around here, Thomas.

604
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:17,638
- Well, they look up to us.

605
00:34:17,638 --> 00:34:18,980
(horse whinnies)

606
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:21,230
You keep the best lookin'
farm in the valley.

607
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:24,083
Do me proud.

608
00:34:25,399 --> 00:34:26,950
- (sighs) Well I work at it.

609
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,246
And you have to, too.

610
00:34:30,246 --> 00:34:32,370
You have to think about
the example you set.

611
00:34:33,498 --> 00:34:37,007
(birds chirping)

612
00:34:37,007 --> 00:34:38,898
(horse whinnies)

613
00:34:38,898 --> 00:34:40,407
- [Thomas] Hm.

614
00:34:40,407 --> 00:34:43,090
(lighthearted music)

615
00:34:43,090 --> 00:34:44,400
- Thomas, what are you doin'?

616
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,450
- Settin' an example.

617
00:34:47,538 --> 00:34:48,371
- What can you be thinkin'?

618
00:34:48,371 --> 00:34:49,204
It's in the middle of the day.

619
00:34:49,204 --> 00:34:51,300
- We're old, married folks, Kate.

620
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:53,340
That's respectable, isn't it?

621
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:55,708
- Thomas, I have to get back to the-

622
00:34:55,708 --> 00:34:58,520
Thomas, I have to get
back to the, (laughs)

623
00:34:58,520 --> 00:34:59,765
stop it.

624
00:34:59,765 --> 00:35:01,790
Don't. (laughs)

625
00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:04,440
- I ain't figurin' on makin'
this a day's work, Kate.

626
00:35:05,279 --> 00:35:07,388
(Kate laughing)

627
00:35:07,388 --> 00:35:10,471
(lighthearted music)

628
00:35:20,948 --> 00:35:23,198
Here you go, son.
- Stop it.

629
00:35:24,508 --> 00:35:26,658
(sighs) I ordered a
Bible from the catalog.

630
00:35:28,456 --> 00:35:29,940
A beautiful one.

631
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:33,400
Real leather cover with
14 karat gold filagree.

632
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,260
Made with finest cloth rag paper

633
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:37,430
from the Bible Society of Boston.

634
00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:38,430
- What'd you want it for?

635
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:40,740
- This family is gonna
have a family Bible,

636
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:42,350
with our children's names written in it,

637
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:45,220
and their children's names,
and their children's names.

638
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:48,070
And we're gonna read to
them from the Word of God.

639
00:35:48,070 --> 00:35:51,410
And I want us to have a prayer
at the table from now on.

640
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:55,440
This family's not gonna live
like a bunch of heathens.

641
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,460
- Prayin' ain't gonna plow any corn.

642
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:59,310
This man could pray
himself blue in the face

643
00:35:59,310 --> 00:36:01,567
and still starve if he didn't work.

644
00:36:01,567 --> 00:36:04,070
- (sighs) Oh, Thomas.

645
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:05,990
- It's a sad day when a
man can't be a heathen

646
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:08,470
in his own house.

647
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:11,060
Just can't believe God's got
nothin' more important to do

648
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:14,230
than watch to see if I've
said something over my dinner.

649
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:15,880
- Well, the way I see it, Thomas,

650
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:18,360
there's two things you can't deny,

651
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,660
nature and your own heart.

652
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,830
And you can't deny there's
something in our hearts

653
00:36:23,830 --> 00:36:26,530
that tell us the difference
between good and evil,

654
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:28,800
tells us to do what's right.

655
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:30,700
The way I see it,

656
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:33,570
that's the little bit
of God in our nature.

657
00:36:33,570 --> 00:36:35,340
Anyway, that's what I figure.

658
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:36,658
- Whoa.

659
00:36:36,658 --> 00:36:38,140
(horse whinnies)

660
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:39,850
Well, (sighs)

661
00:36:40,970 --> 00:36:42,320
you think I oughta give in?

662
00:36:43,438 --> 00:36:46,108
I don't want Kate thinkin'
she's runnin' this family.

663
00:36:46,108 --> 00:36:48,710
- (laughs) Well, Thomas,
we can talk about God

664
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:50,640
but don't ask me about marriage.

665
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,090
You got the wrong fella here.

666
00:36:59,938 --> 00:37:01,200
- Give me your hand, Hock.

667
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,998
Gonna give thanks.
- Thanks for what?

668
00:37:03,998 --> 00:37:04,831
- For what we got.

669
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:09,600
The eyes of all wait upon thee, oh Lord.

670
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,950
Thou givest them their meat in due season.

671
00:37:13,950 --> 00:37:16,230
Thou openest thine hand and,

672
00:37:21,290 --> 00:37:26,290
and satisfy us the desire of all things.

673
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:28,770
Amen.

674
00:37:28,770 --> 00:37:29,690
- Amen.

675
00:37:29,690 --> 00:37:30,523
- Amen.

676
00:37:36,707 --> 00:37:39,374
(Kate chuckles)

677
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:41,660
- What's so funny?

678
00:37:42,546 --> 00:37:46,087
- (laughs) You are.

679
00:37:49,530 --> 00:37:50,363
Thank you.

680
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:55,600
- You laugh at me?

681
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,750
- Never at you, Thomas.

682
00:37:58,140 --> 00:37:59,270
Always with you.

683
00:38:00,356 --> 00:38:03,189
(slow soft music)

684
00:38:06,792 --> 00:38:08,300
Thomas.

685
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:09,133
Again?

686
00:38:11,836 --> 00:38:14,169
(puffs air)

687
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:16,470
- That's not a sin, is it?

688
00:38:18,615 --> 00:38:20,640
- I don't know. (sighs)

689
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:21,890
It sure feels like one.

690
00:38:23,367 --> 00:38:26,200
(slow soft music)

691
00:38:34,415 --> 00:38:38,927
♪ All things wise and wonderful ♪

692
00:38:38,927 --> 00:38:42,677
♪ The Lord God made them all ♪

693
00:38:43,634 --> 00:38:46,070
(dog barks)

694
00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:47,624
Springer!

695
00:38:47,624 --> 00:38:49,992
(dog barking)

696
00:38:49,992 --> 00:38:51,130
(slow soft music)

697
00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:52,870
- That old dog of mine
been comin' over the hill

698
00:38:52,870 --> 00:38:54,320
and killin' my sheep, missus.

699
00:38:57,604 --> 00:38:59,660
- We'll keep him tied and
we'll pay for the sheep.

700
00:39:01,484 --> 00:39:02,940
(dog growling)

701
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:06,044
Don't you shoot that dog!

702
00:39:06,044 --> 00:39:07,804
(dog barking)

703
00:39:07,804 --> 00:39:10,971
(slow dramatic music)

704
00:39:19,444 --> 00:39:22,506
- You tell your husband a fair warnin'.

705
00:39:22,506 --> 00:39:24,900
I'll kill anything comes over my hill.

706
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:25,733
Anything.

707
00:39:27,644 --> 00:39:30,830
(slow dramatic music)

708
00:39:30,830 --> 00:39:33,630
- Hocking!
(dog barking)

709
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:34,463
- Hey!

710
00:39:35,903 --> 00:39:38,653
(Hocking grunts)

711
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,684
Got more guts than his
old man, doesn't he?

712
00:39:43,684 --> 00:39:45,794
(laughs)

713
00:39:45,794 --> 00:39:48,502
(slow dramatic music)

714
00:39:48,502 --> 00:39:49,770
- (sighs) You shouldn't
have done that, Hock.

715
00:39:49,770 --> 00:39:50,603
- Why not?

716
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:54,530
- Don't you tell your
daddy that Goram hit you.

717
00:39:54,530 --> 00:39:56,020
- Why?

718
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:58,250
- Because he'd wanna go and fight Goram,

719
00:39:58,250 --> 00:40:00,150
and I don't want him to ever fight Goram.

720
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:03,370
Promise me, Hock.
- Yes, mama.

721
00:40:03,370 --> 00:40:05,540
- Good boy.

722
00:40:07,444 --> 00:40:09,944
(door closes)

723
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,260
Goram Schrader was here today.

724
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:16,530
- Here?

725
00:40:16,530 --> 00:40:17,750
What'd he want?

726
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:19,720
- Says Springer's been killin' his sheep.

727
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:21,470
- He's a liar.

728
00:40:21,470 --> 00:40:23,710
Spence told me his sheep
died from waterin' downstream

729
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:26,010
at his lime pit.

730
00:40:26,010 --> 00:40:28,090
- Is it worth it, Thomas?

731
00:40:28,090 --> 00:40:30,490
You have to own that hill so
bad you have to go feudin'

732
00:40:30,490 --> 00:40:31,900
with the likes of Goram Schrader?

733
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:33,920
- Put some distance between us and him.

734
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:34,753
He don't keep to it,

735
00:40:34,753 --> 00:40:36,820
I'm gonna have him lawed for tresspassin'.

736
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:40,586
- Thomas!

737
00:40:40,586 --> 00:40:42,791
(door closes)

738
00:40:42,791 --> 00:40:44,794
(sighs)

739
00:40:44,794 --> 00:40:48,220
(people chattering)
(slow dramatic music)

740
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:49,053
- [Man] Henry.

741
00:41:02,944 --> 00:41:05,434
- Come in, come here.

742
00:41:05,434 --> 00:41:08,184
(birds chirping)

743
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:12,500
There's 3.000, and thought they
were gettin' the best of it.

744
00:41:13,450 --> 00:41:16,110
Hell, if a man can't cut $3000

745
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:18,600
worth of good pine lumber in
those deep ravines up there,

746
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:20,650
it's only because he's too lazy to do it.

747
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:24,700
- Some people say he has
squatter's rights on his side.

748
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:28,095
His family been huntin' up
there for three generations.

749
00:41:28,095 --> 00:41:30,030
- That hill belongs to our family now.

750
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:31,390
That's you and me, Kate.

751
00:41:31,390 --> 00:41:34,500
From this day forth,
that's Linthorne Hill.

752
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:36,280
It's just like I promised you,

753
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:37,990
the day we set foot on this land.

754
00:41:41,559 --> 00:41:44,309
(birds chirping)

755
00:41:46,390 --> 00:41:48,890
(dog panting)

756
00:41:50,569 --> 00:41:53,702
(gun fires)

757
00:41:53,702 --> 00:41:56,285
(Goram laughs)

758
00:41:57,130 --> 00:41:59,790
Appreciate you takin' the
time on a Sunday, Burt.

759
00:41:59,790 --> 00:42:01,100
- Well, if you didn't ride her so hard,

760
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:02,750
I wouldn't have to shoe her so often.

761
00:42:08,622 --> 00:42:11,982
(metal clanging)

762
00:42:11,982 --> 00:42:14,565
(Thomas sighs)

763
00:42:18,741 --> 00:42:19,740
- I wanna go home.

764
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:20,740
- You stop it, Hock.

765
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,950
Get your rig outta my way,
Schrader, I got work to do.

766
00:42:25,950 --> 00:42:28,740
- I seen a little of your
work up on Church Hill.

767
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:31,820
Right pretty signs you got
nailed onto them trees.

768
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:33,892
- It's Linthorne Hill now.

769
00:42:33,892 --> 00:42:35,790
And those signs mean what they say.

770
00:42:35,790 --> 00:42:37,000
- Trouble with fellas like you

771
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,720
is they think they can buy everybody else

772
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:40,270
clear off the whole damn earth.

773
00:42:41,390 --> 00:42:43,862
Never ready to let good enough alone.

774
00:42:43,862 --> 00:42:45,540
As you get a little money ahead,

775
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:47,520
gotta try and take the
bread outta somebody's mouth

776
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,400
so you can go around braggin'!

777
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,630
You do about this black mare

778
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:52,850
you paid Briarly two prices for.

779
00:42:52,850 --> 00:42:54,950
- My business what I paid, none of yours.

780
00:42:54,950 --> 00:42:56,350
- I'm makin' it my business!

781
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:59,000
I had Briarly talked
into lettin' me have her

782
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,030
for a couple a hundred
before you butted in.

783
00:43:01,030 --> 00:43:02,870
- No law against
out-biddin' you, is there?

784
00:43:02,870 --> 00:43:04,670
- You keep buttin' your head around,

785
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:07,860
come the day you'll knock your brains out.

786
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:09,450
Or somebody knocks 'em out for you.

787
00:43:09,450 --> 00:43:11,572
- You gonna move your rig?

788
00:43:11,572 --> 00:43:13,780
(Goram spits)

789
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:14,613
Heeyah!

790
00:43:16,410 --> 00:43:18,041
- [Hocking] Papa, papa!

791
00:43:18,041 --> 00:43:21,290
(horses whinny)
(intense dramatic music)

792
00:43:21,290 --> 00:43:22,123
- Whoa.

793
00:43:22,123 --> 00:43:22,956
Easy.

794
00:43:23,790 --> 00:43:25,330
Easy.

795
00:43:25,330 --> 00:43:27,250
You never show you're afraid,

796
00:43:27,250 --> 00:43:28,400
even if you are.

797
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:29,233
You hear me?

798
00:43:29,233 --> 00:43:30,270
Never.

799
00:43:30,270 --> 00:43:31,920
You're a Linthorne.
- Yes, papa.

800
00:43:36,952 --> 00:43:40,535
(Kate wailing and moaning)

801
00:43:57,240 --> 00:43:59,450
- Baby don't wanna come, Mr. Linthorne.

802
00:43:59,450 --> 00:44:01,480
Even after I rub camphor oil on her belly,

803
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:03,920
and that always makes the baby come.

804
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:04,753
Shh!

805
00:44:05,712 --> 00:44:08,379
(Kate groaning)

806
00:44:11,790 --> 00:44:13,430
- Kate.

807
00:44:13,430 --> 00:44:15,000
Should I get the doctor?

808
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,060
- Go.

809
00:44:16,060 --> 00:44:16,893
Yes.

810
00:44:17,810 --> 00:44:18,981
Yes!

811
00:44:18,981 --> 00:44:20,632
Go!

812
00:44:20,632 --> 00:44:22,580
(intense dramatic music)

813
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:24,230
- That's my Belle.

814
00:44:24,230 --> 00:44:25,063
Go, girl.

815
00:44:25,063 --> 00:44:27,160
That's my Belle.

816
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:30,577
(intense dramatic music)

817
00:44:34,272 --> 00:44:37,189
(knocking on door)

818
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:39,220
- Linthorne?

819
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:40,053
On its way, is it?

820
00:44:40,053 --> 00:44:41,840
- Something's not right,
doc, you got to hurry.

821
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:43,290
- Let me get my coat and bag.

822
00:44:44,141 --> 00:44:45,180
(intense dramatic music)

823
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:47,070
Linthorne, you'll kill
us drivin' like this!

824
00:44:47,070 --> 00:44:48,980
- Don't you worry about my driving.

825
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:51,160
Come on, girl!
- Hold her in for god sakes.

826
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:51,993
Linthorne!

827
00:44:51,993 --> 00:44:52,826
- She'll be fine!

828
00:44:52,826 --> 00:44:56,310
She's done it a hundred times.

829
00:44:56,310 --> 00:44:57,143
Come on, Belle!

830
00:44:58,190 --> 00:44:59,941
You just hang on.

831
00:44:59,941 --> 00:45:02,040
(intense dramatic music)

832
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:05,105
(horse whinnies)

833
00:45:05,105 --> 00:45:07,522
(men scream)

834
00:45:09,341 --> 00:45:14,341
(Thomas groaning)
(crickets chirping)

835
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:48,000
- Someone we loved and admired
has been taken from us,

836
00:45:48,070 --> 00:45:49,320
and it tests our faith.

837
00:45:50,870 --> 00:45:54,350
There are those who seek to
cast blame and find fault,

838
00:45:54,350 --> 00:45:55,830
but there is no fault.

839
00:45:57,690 --> 00:45:59,560
Those who surrender to the impulse

840
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:02,540
to lash out in temporal judgment

841
00:46:03,530 --> 00:46:04,580
will be disappointed.

842
00:46:05,770 --> 00:46:08,310
For no healing lies that way.

843
00:46:08,310 --> 00:46:10,420
No justice and no relief.

844
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:15,610
We must seek our strength
and our solace in prayer.

845
00:46:17,110 --> 00:46:19,440
Our Lord and Savior
will answer our prayers

846
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:20,540
and comfort our grief.

847
00:46:21,770 --> 00:46:26,770
For his strength and his mercy
and his love are boundless.

848
00:46:30,147 --> 00:46:35,147
(slow somber music)
(fire crackling)

849
00:46:41,550 --> 00:46:42,900
- Come back to us, Thomas.

850
00:46:44,030 --> 00:46:46,060
The children need you, I need you.

851
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:50,050
We love you.

852
00:46:50,050 --> 00:46:52,450
- Trouble with believin'
in nothin' but yourself

853
00:46:54,590 --> 00:46:56,680
is you got no one but yourself to blame.

854
00:47:00,230 --> 00:47:02,930
He had a whole lifetime of
helpin' folks ahead of him.

855
00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:05,550
Why wasn't it me and not him?

856
00:47:06,983 --> 00:47:11,983
(slow somber music)
(fire crackling)

857
00:47:12,751 --> 00:47:15,301
- (sighs) What's the good
of this broodin', Thomas?

858
00:47:19,275 --> 00:47:24,275
(crickets chirping)
(slow somber music)

859
00:47:48,856 --> 00:47:49,930
- [Spence] Bubba?

860
00:47:49,930 --> 00:47:50,763
- I'm in here.

861
00:47:58,670 --> 00:48:01,060
- Get dressed, there's
something I wanna show you.

862
00:48:03,610 --> 00:48:06,860
I always thought there
was something kinda funny

863
00:48:06,860 --> 00:48:09,110
about Belle stumblin' like that.

864
00:48:10,740 --> 00:48:12,790
Belle wasn't a stumblin' horse.

865
00:48:12,790 --> 00:48:15,640
I always remember how she picked
her feet way up in the air.

866
00:48:22,220 --> 00:48:23,820
Look at this, what do you think?

867
00:48:24,670 --> 00:48:27,670
(crickets chirping)

868
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:43,950
- Goram Schrader.

869
00:48:43,950 --> 00:48:44,870
- Yup.

870
00:48:44,870 --> 00:48:48,059
You prove Goram did this,
you have him on murder.

871
00:48:48,059 --> 00:48:50,230
But it'd be kinda hard to do that now.

872
00:48:50,230 --> 00:48:51,780
- You tell anyone else?

873
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:53,190
- No.

874
00:48:53,190 --> 00:48:54,570
I didn't think I was
gonna tell you either.

875
00:48:54,570 --> 00:48:57,120
I was afraid you might
do something foolish.

876
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:59,360
(crickets chirping)

877
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:00,193
- Why did you?

878
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:04,300
- I seen what you been doin' to yourself.

879
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:06,700
And I decided you got a
right to know the truth.

880
00:49:07,607 --> 00:49:10,607
(slow somber music)

881
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:20,700
Are you gonna do something foolish?

882
00:49:21,984 --> 00:49:24,984
(slow somber music)

883
00:49:29,660 --> 00:49:31,810
- If you wait a minute
while I wash up I'd,

884
00:49:32,910 --> 00:49:34,850
I'd like to sit down at dinner with you.

885
00:49:36,070 --> 00:49:38,570
(baby fusses)

886
00:49:40,550 --> 00:49:43,383
(water splashing)

887
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:51,300
(slow somber music)

888
00:49:56,670 --> 00:49:58,420
- We've missed you, Thomas.

889
00:49:58,420 --> 00:50:00,010
Haven't we, children?

890
00:50:00,010 --> 00:50:01,645
- I missed you, papa.

891
00:50:01,645 --> 00:50:02,930
- I missed you more.

892
00:50:03,788 --> 00:50:04,621
- Did not.

893
00:50:08,621 --> 00:50:11,120
- Well, look at you.

894
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:13,470
Aren't you just about
the most beautiful thing?

895
00:50:14,731 --> 00:50:16,520
(laughs)

896
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:17,353
Hello.

897
00:50:20,110 --> 00:50:22,650
- The good Lord has given
us reason to be grateful

898
00:50:22,650 --> 00:50:23,880
on this joyous day.

899
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:26,200
He has answered our prayers.

900
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:30,300
It gladdens my heart as I know
it gladdens all of our hearts

901
00:50:31,377 --> 00:50:33,190
to see our dear friend and neighbor,

902
00:50:33,190 --> 00:50:35,120
Thomas Linthorne, return to us again.

903
00:50:38,086 --> 00:50:42,958
(dog barking)
(slow soft music)

904
00:50:42,958 --> 00:50:45,541
(birds cawing)

905
00:50:55,248 --> 00:50:57,665
(Kate sighs)

906
00:50:58,710 --> 00:51:00,980
- Why don't we have Lonzo
winter here with us?

907
00:51:02,222 --> 00:51:04,720
(sighs) There's no smoke in his chimney.

908
00:51:06,646 --> 00:51:10,350
(sighs) He can't even
light a fire anymore.

909
00:51:11,310 --> 00:51:13,320
- Live here, with us?

910
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:15,390
You sure about that?
- He's got no one.

911
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:19,300
We're his neighbors, Thomas.

912
00:51:21,180 --> 00:51:22,380
It's our Christian duty.

913
00:51:23,543 --> 00:51:26,376
(slow soft music)

914
00:51:33,634 --> 00:51:34,467
- Whoa.

915
00:51:39,503 --> 00:51:42,253
(Lonzo babbling)

916
00:51:44,823 --> 00:51:47,823
(knocking on glass)

917
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:54,873
Lonzo?

918
00:51:56,130 --> 00:51:56,963
You all right?

919
00:51:58,263 --> 00:52:01,013
(Lonzo babbling)

920
00:52:09,250 --> 00:52:11,917
(Lonzo shrieks)

921
00:52:16,306 --> 00:52:17,889
- Is that you, Jim?

922
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:23,770
Oh, you come back to me, boy.

923
00:52:23,770 --> 00:52:25,600
- It's Thomas Linthorne, Lonzo.

924
00:52:26,530 --> 00:52:28,503
Come to invite you to visit.

925
00:52:28,503 --> 00:52:30,103
- You've come back to me, Jimmy.

926
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:33,100
After all I done to you.

927
00:52:34,670 --> 00:52:35,890
I just, come back.

928
00:52:38,062 --> 00:52:38,895
My son.

929
00:52:40,401 --> 00:52:43,716
(slow soft music)

930
00:52:43,716 --> 00:52:46,466
(Lonzo babbling)

931
00:52:57,419 --> 00:52:59,350
- Poor old fellow.

932
00:52:59,350 --> 00:53:01,183
Near 90 and all alone.

933
00:53:05,980 --> 00:53:07,600
Welcome.

934
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:09,300
Welcome to our home, Mr. Brewster.

935
00:53:10,803 --> 00:53:13,970
(slow dramatic music)

936
00:53:14,921 --> 00:53:17,671
(glass clinking)

937
00:53:24,241 --> 00:53:26,991
(water sloshing)

938
00:53:28,230 --> 00:53:30,880
- Spence says his boy Jim's
a real piece of business.

939
00:53:32,140 --> 00:53:34,220
Probably in the hoosegow somewhere.

940
00:53:34,220 --> 00:53:35,790
He had a daughter, too.

941
00:53:35,790 --> 00:53:37,790
She ran off with a drifter 15 years ago.

942
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:40,849
Never heard from her since.

943
00:53:40,849 --> 00:53:42,840
- (sighs) I don't know
how a man goes so wrong

944
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:44,020
with his children.

945
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:46,460
- If it was me, I'd rather
be dead and done with it.

946
00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:49,397
Left alone, starving, freezing all alone.

947
00:53:51,067 --> 00:53:53,900
(slow soft music)

948
00:53:54,987 --> 00:53:57,570
(birds cawing)

949
00:53:58,545 --> 00:54:01,295
(dog whimpering)

950
00:54:02,394 --> 00:54:06,650
Go on.

951
00:54:06,650 --> 00:54:08,983
(bird caws)

952
00:54:10,081 --> 00:54:13,248
(slow dramatic music)

953
00:54:18,198 --> 00:54:20,698
(bird cawing)

954
00:54:23,857 --> 00:54:24,690
(dog barking)

955
00:54:24,690 --> 00:54:25,523
Springer!

956
00:54:26,740 --> 00:54:27,573
Springer!

957
00:54:30,762 --> 00:54:32,190
(gun fires)

958
00:54:32,190 --> 00:54:33,023
Springer!

959
00:54:35,463 --> 00:54:40,463
(dog whimpering)
(slow dramatic music)

960
00:54:43,459 --> 00:54:45,959
(bird cawing)

961
00:54:47,816 --> 00:54:48,860
- [Goram] I gave you a fair warning.

962
00:54:48,860 --> 00:54:50,790
I'll kill anything that
comes over that hill.

963
00:54:50,790 --> 00:54:52,790
- Show yourself, you dirty coward!

964
00:54:54,017 --> 00:54:58,640
(gun clicks)
(slow dramatic music)

965
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:00,690
Surprised you picked this spot, Schrader.

966
00:55:01,730 --> 00:55:03,180
Nowhere to string a wire.

967
00:55:05,220 --> 00:55:06,740
- I don't need nothin' but my hands

968
00:55:06,740 --> 00:55:09,611
to take care of you, Linthorne.

969
00:55:09,611 --> 00:55:13,024
(intense dramatic music)
(Goram screaming)

970
00:55:13,024 --> 00:55:18,024
(men grunting)
(birds cawing)

971
00:55:19,859 --> 00:55:22,442
(Goram grunts)

972
00:55:23,921 --> 00:55:26,379
(intense dramatic music)

973
00:55:26,379 --> 00:55:28,962
(Goram grunts)

974
00:55:34,708 --> 00:55:37,291
(men grunting)

975
00:55:39,939 --> 00:55:44,939
(Thomas groans)
(Goram coughing)

976
00:55:47,872 --> 00:55:52,872
(Goram grunts)
(intense dramatic music)

977
00:55:54,385 --> 00:55:56,968
(birds cawing)

978
00:56:06,256 --> 00:56:09,089
(Thomas grunting)

979
00:56:15,496 --> 00:56:18,079
(birds cawing)

980
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:29,350
(Thomas panting)

981
00:56:32,279 --> 00:56:35,446
(slow dramatic music)

982
00:56:40,656 --> 00:56:44,307
(Thomas grunting)

983
00:56:44,307 --> 00:56:46,724
(body thuds)

984
00:57:00,230 --> 00:57:01,783
(Kate grunting)

985
00:57:01,783 --> 00:57:03,698
(child shouts)

986
00:57:03,698 --> 00:57:05,111
(Lonzo laughing)

987
00:57:05,111 --> 00:57:10,111
(door slams)
(Thomas panting)

988
00:57:11,032 --> 00:57:12,365
- [Kate] Thomas?

989
00:57:16,797 --> 00:57:18,913
What happened to you?

990
00:57:18,913 --> 00:57:23,080
- (grunts) Get me upstairs, Kate.

991
00:57:27,048 --> 00:57:29,548
- [Child] What happened to pa?

992
00:57:33,264 --> 00:57:36,590
- Looks like your daddy had
himself a bit of a fall.

993
00:57:36,590 --> 00:57:38,120
Don't you worry.

994
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:41,230
He's gonna be fine.

995
00:57:46,775 --> 00:57:49,442
(Thomas groans)

996
00:57:58,718 --> 00:58:02,135
(Thomas gasps and pants)

997
00:58:04,609 --> 00:58:08,290
(slow dramatic music)

998
00:58:08,290 --> 00:58:09,590
- I killed Goram Schrader.

999
00:58:10,730 --> 00:58:11,580
It was him or me.

1000
00:58:13,457 --> 00:58:15,663
You're the only person on the whole earth

1001
00:58:17,140 --> 00:58:18,490
that knows it besides me.

1002
00:58:21,129 --> 00:58:24,053
I ain't ever going to mention it again.

1003
00:58:25,244 --> 00:58:28,411
(slow dramatic music)

1004
00:58:50,210 --> 00:58:51,160
- Startin' to snow.

1005
00:58:53,525 --> 00:58:56,692
(slow dramatic music)

1006
00:59:13,893 --> 00:59:16,560
(Thomas grunts)

1007
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:27,289
(birds chirping)

1008
00:59:27,289 --> 00:59:30,539
(gasping and coughing)

1009
00:59:33,120 --> 00:59:34,170
- You gotta eat, Lon.

1010
00:59:35,285 --> 00:59:36,340
You haven't eaten for days.

1011
00:59:37,985 --> 00:59:42,770
- (babbling) I've been a
burden on you long enough.

1012
00:59:45,035 --> 00:59:48,560
I know it's time for me to die.

1013
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:49,560
- Oh, hush.

1014
00:59:49,560 --> 00:59:51,010
No one's dying in my kitchen.

1015
00:59:52,780 --> 00:59:53,613
- No.

1016
00:59:57,280 --> 00:59:59,830
Send your good husband in here.

1017
01:00:01,805 --> 01:00:05,055
(coughing and gagging)

1018
01:00:09,787 --> 01:00:11,954
(gasping)

1019
01:00:17,310 --> 01:00:22,310
So, the land is all yours, Thomas.

1020
01:00:24,612 --> 01:00:26,900
I want it to be that way.

1021
01:00:28,379 --> 01:00:30,620
I want it to be that way, (coughs) Jim,

1022
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:36,350
he ain't never took much shine

1023
01:00:36,350 --> 01:00:37,940
to ownin' a piece of land.

1024
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:41,830
He never gave a hoot
for his pappy that boy,

1025
01:00:41,830 --> 01:00:45,810
never a hoot, not a hoot, no.

1026
01:00:45,810 --> 01:00:47,820
You just take down the fence

1027
01:00:48,850 --> 01:00:51,240
and call it all Linthorne.

1028
01:00:53,603 --> 01:00:54,938
(Lonzo coughing)

1029
01:00:54,938 --> 01:00:56,388
- You sure about this, Lonzo?

1030
01:00:57,860 --> 01:01:01,730
- If I was you, I would get me a witness.

1031
01:01:03,790 --> 01:01:06,480
You don't want Jim lawyering you.

1032
01:01:07,350 --> 01:01:09,640
And he would, he would, just for spite.

1033
01:01:11,090 --> 01:01:11,923
Yes, he would.

1034
01:01:16,550 --> 01:01:19,380
- I think, I think we
should sleep on it, Lonzo.

1035
01:01:21,770 --> 01:01:22,620
- Suit yourself.

1036
01:01:25,744 --> 01:01:28,790
I'll be gone by mornin'. (laughs)

1037
01:01:32,660 --> 01:01:36,032
Not gonna see another sunrise.

1038
01:01:36,032 --> 01:01:38,257
(slow soft music)

1039
01:01:38,257 --> 01:01:42,924
Not gonna see another sunrise. (coughs)

1040
01:01:48,030 --> 01:01:51,100
- "I, Alonzo Brewster,
farmer, Lancaster Township,

1041
01:01:51,100 --> 01:01:54,960
Fairfield County, do give
my farm and farmhouse,

1042
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:57,490
with the buildings and everything in them,

1043
01:01:57,490 --> 01:02:00,910
to Thomas Linthorne,
farmer, Lancaster Township,

1044
01:02:00,910 --> 01:02:05,580
Fairfield County, to do
with whatever he wants to,

1045
01:02:05,580 --> 01:02:07,240
either to keep it or to sell it."

1046
01:02:09,060 --> 01:02:10,310
Is that all right, Lonzo?

1047
01:02:11,801 --> 01:02:15,800
- (gasping) Exactly what's in my head.

1048
01:02:20,790 --> 01:02:23,190
- You have to make your mark.

1049
01:02:31,614 --> 01:02:35,473
- Where?
- Right there.

1050
01:02:35,473 --> 01:02:39,223
(Lonzo gasping and wheezing)

1051
01:02:45,151 --> 01:02:50,151
- I know I don't deserve
to die like this. (laughs)

1052
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:05,233
- Lonzo?

1053
01:03:09,903 --> 01:03:12,494
He's gone.

1054
01:03:12,494 --> 01:03:15,327
(slow soft music)

1055
01:03:26,860 --> 01:03:29,310
- I'd say the old reprobate
was right about that.

1056
01:03:31,687 --> 01:03:34,894
- Who's to say anybody
dies the way he deserves?

1057
01:03:34,894 --> 01:03:37,840
(slow soft music)

1058
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:39,290
- I think Goram Schrader did.

1059
01:03:41,080 --> 01:03:44,175
(slow soft music)

1060
01:03:44,175 --> 01:03:45,008
- Do you?

1061
01:03:46,330 --> 01:03:47,163
- I do.

1062
01:03:54,717 --> 01:03:57,828
(slow soft music)
(birds chirping)

1063
01:03:57,828 --> 01:03:58,661
- Whoa.

1064
01:04:05,446 --> 01:04:08,196
(horse whinnies)

1065
01:04:16,848 --> 01:04:19,681
(hooves clopping)

1066
01:04:47,056 --> 01:04:49,780
(birds cawing)

1067
01:04:49,780 --> 01:04:50,613
- Mister.

1068
01:04:52,820 --> 01:04:55,890
What you want here? (laughs)

1069
01:04:55,890 --> 01:04:56,990
- This is my farm.

1070
01:04:56,990 --> 01:05:00,420
- Oh, are you Tom Linthorne?

1071
01:05:00,420 --> 01:05:01,310
- That's right.

1072
01:05:01,310 --> 01:05:02,143
Who are you?

1073
01:05:03,150 --> 01:05:04,620
- I'm Jim Brewster.

1074
01:05:06,370 --> 01:05:08,277
I heard the old man died.

1075
01:05:08,277 --> 01:05:10,050
I heard he willed the place to you.

1076
01:05:10,050 --> 01:05:11,570
- He wouldn't have it no other way.

1077
01:05:11,570 --> 01:05:13,750
Spence Vitt was witness to the will.

1078
01:05:13,750 --> 01:05:16,130
- I ain't thinkin' hard of you.

1079
01:05:16,130 --> 01:05:19,040
Never expected I'd get it. (laughs)

1080
01:05:21,700 --> 01:05:24,430
Well this here is Lucille.

1081
01:05:24,430 --> 01:05:28,266
Prettiest gal to ever come
out of Curdaling, Kansas.

1082
01:05:28,266 --> 01:05:29,466
(laughs)

1083
01:05:29,466 --> 01:05:31,470
I met her traveling through.

1084
01:05:31,470 --> 01:05:33,898
Sure was anxious to get outta there.

1085
01:05:33,898 --> 01:05:34,760
(laughs) Weren't ya?

1086
01:05:35,660 --> 01:05:38,310
Well don't mind, she don't
talk much, she's just shy.

1087
01:05:40,950 --> 01:05:42,410
- How you doin', Miss Brewster?

1088
01:05:43,317 --> 01:05:45,580
- (laughs) Did you hear that, Lucy?

1089
01:05:45,580 --> 01:05:47,670
He called you Mrs. Brewster.

1090
01:05:47,670 --> 01:05:49,650
Ain't anybody ever called her that before.

1091
01:05:51,250 --> 01:05:53,688
- I'm pleased to make your acquaintance.

1092
01:05:53,688 --> 01:05:56,470
(slow soft music)

1093
01:05:56,470 --> 01:05:57,303
- Uh, (sighs).

1094
01:05:58,410 --> 01:05:59,970
You like to farm, Jim?

1095
01:05:59,970 --> 01:06:01,980
- Ain't no worse than
the other things I done.

1096
01:06:02,898 --> 01:06:07,400
(slow soft music)
(crickets chirping)

1097
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:09,300
- How'd you like to
have the old place back?

1098
01:06:12,408 --> 01:06:15,308
- If pappy meant me to have
it, he'd have willed it to me.

1099
01:06:17,590 --> 01:06:21,510
- I have to admit I never
thought you'd be back here.

1100
01:06:23,265 --> 01:06:26,115
Now that you are, seems to me
you got some kind of claim.

1101
01:06:27,450 --> 01:06:28,850
Only fair, the way I see it.

1102
01:06:31,210 --> 01:06:32,660
What I'm thinkin' of is this.

1103
01:06:34,408 --> 01:06:37,420
You got nothin' to do,
you use my equipment,

1104
01:06:37,420 --> 01:06:40,660
you work this farm, and
you pay me with a cut.

1105
01:06:40,660 --> 01:06:44,140
Say 10% across what you make?

1106
01:06:45,030 --> 01:06:47,630
- Well how many years I
have to keep payin' you off?

1107
01:06:49,709 --> 01:06:51,560
- Well I tell you what,
you stop your drinkin',

1108
01:06:51,560 --> 01:06:53,960
you get this place goin',
and I'll deed it over.

1109
01:06:56,050 --> 01:06:57,230
I'll sign my name to it.

1110
01:07:00,037 --> 01:07:01,680
- We could have a place of our own.

1111
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:04,138
Not be wanderin' all over no more.

1112
01:07:04,138 --> 01:07:09,138
(slow soft music)
(birds cawing)

1113
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:11,030
- I guess maybe I'll try.

1114
01:07:18,658 --> 01:07:20,010
- [Kate] I don't know why
you're doing this, Thomas,

1115
01:07:20,010 --> 01:07:20,843
I just don't.

1116
01:07:21,790 --> 01:07:23,210
- [Thomas] I felt like I was comin'

1117
01:07:23,210 --> 01:07:25,200
between a father and a son.

1118
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:28,120
Besides, we don't need poor
old Lonzo's little farm anyway.

1119
01:07:28,120 --> 01:07:30,820
- (sighs) That is not
what you said yesterday.

1120
01:07:30,820 --> 01:07:32,840
You said it was prime
land and it'd be perfect

1121
01:07:32,840 --> 01:07:34,440
to give Hocking when he marries.

1122
01:07:36,310 --> 01:07:38,480
Charity begins at home, Thomas.

1123
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:40,470
- I felt I had to do it.

1124
01:07:40,470 --> 01:07:42,020
Let that be an end to it, Kate.

1125
01:07:45,631 --> 01:07:48,548
(Lucille laughing)

1126
01:07:52,635 --> 01:07:55,660
(knocking on door)

1127
01:07:55,660 --> 01:07:58,720
- Uh, Mr. Linthorne said he'd
give me a horse and plow,

1128
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:01,530
so I come for it.
- Howdy, Jim.

1129
01:08:01,530 --> 01:08:04,000
Good to see you gettin' an
early start turnin' ground.

1130
01:08:05,110 --> 01:08:07,970
Oh, Kate, this is Jim
and Lucille Brewster,

1131
01:08:07,970 --> 01:08:09,990
our new neighbors.
- Ma'am.

1132
01:08:09,990 --> 01:08:11,880
- How do, Mrs. Linthorne?

1133
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:13,120
I come to make your acquaintance.

1134
01:08:14,130 --> 01:08:15,380
- I'm glad to make yours.

1135
01:08:16,970 --> 01:08:18,070
Why don't you come in?

1136
01:08:20,390 --> 01:08:21,223
- Follow me.

1137
01:08:24,278 --> 01:08:25,660
(door closes)

1138
01:08:25,660 --> 01:08:27,650
- Lon didn't leave anything
like a feather bed up there,

1139
01:08:27,650 --> 01:08:28,610
did he?

1140
01:08:28,610 --> 01:08:29,530
- [Lucille] I don't know.

1141
01:08:30,498 --> 01:08:31,680
- You haven't looked?

1142
01:08:31,680 --> 01:08:32,730
- Ain't come to mind.

1143
01:08:33,620 --> 01:08:35,290
We don't need any covers yet.

1144
01:08:35,290 --> 01:08:36,740
- Well, you will come winter.

1145
01:08:37,750 --> 01:08:39,450
You sew yourself a tick
around threshin' time,

1146
01:08:39,450 --> 01:08:40,938
bring it over here.

1147
01:08:40,938 --> 01:08:42,100
You can have all my goose down this year,

1148
01:08:42,100 --> 01:08:43,930
but it won't be enough.

1149
01:08:43,930 --> 01:08:45,390
You have Jim borrow Thomas' gun

1150
01:08:45,390 --> 01:08:48,110
and go out to Black Eye Lake this fall.

1151
01:08:48,110 --> 01:08:51,250
He can shoot himself enough
geese to stuff it full.

1152
01:08:51,250 --> 01:08:54,250
And you can eat roast goose
every Sunday night, all winter.

1153
01:08:54,250 --> 01:08:56,678
- Jim might think that's an awful trouble.

1154
01:08:56,678 --> 01:08:57,620
- If he don't wanna trouble himself,

1155
01:08:57,620 --> 01:09:00,898
you've made an awful
mistake takin' on that farm.

1156
01:09:00,898 --> 01:09:01,810
- I think he'll be all right,

1157
01:09:03,140 --> 01:09:05,270
if I can keep him from drinkin'.

1158
01:09:05,270 --> 01:09:06,220
- You pregnant yet?

1159
01:09:07,650 --> 01:09:09,200
- No, ma'am.

1160
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:10,070
- You know what's good for you,

1161
01:09:10,070 --> 01:09:12,970
have a baby as soon as you can
manage it, this first year.

1162
01:09:14,370 --> 01:09:16,480
That's a way to make a
man proud of himself.

1163
01:09:16,480 --> 01:09:17,900
- Yes, ma'am.

1164
01:09:17,900 --> 01:09:19,610
- You can call me Kate.

1165
01:09:19,610 --> 01:09:21,530
I'm hardly 10 years older than you.

1166
01:09:21,530 --> 01:09:22,750
- Really?

1167
01:09:22,750 --> 01:09:23,950
I thought you was older?

1168
01:09:26,020 --> 01:09:29,850
- Well, that's farm life for ya.

1169
01:09:29,850 --> 01:09:32,683
(slow soft music)

1170
01:09:44,957 --> 01:09:46,957
(sighs)

1171
01:09:47,857 --> 01:09:52,240
- Don't remember anything
about havin' feather beds.

1172
01:09:52,240 --> 01:09:53,340
- Till you married me.

1173
01:09:55,060 --> 01:09:57,300
Never heard you complain
about sleepin' under one.

1174
01:09:57,300 --> 01:09:59,640
- Some folks don't care
about sleepin' soft.

1175
01:09:59,640 --> 01:10:01,620
- Never said anything about sleepin' soft.

1176
01:10:02,610 --> 01:10:04,310
Sleepin' warm I was talkin' about.

1177
01:10:08,698 --> 01:10:11,531
(slow soft music)

1178
01:10:23,738 --> 01:10:26,520
Are you just gonna stand and stare?

1179
01:10:26,520 --> 01:10:28,233
You're lettin' in the cold.

1180
01:10:29,148 --> 01:10:31,981
(slow soft music)

1181
01:11:04,937 --> 01:11:07,687
(horse whinnies)

1182
01:11:11,900 --> 01:11:14,470
- You could put the oats
in the feedbag, Grover.

1183
01:11:14,470 --> 01:11:15,890
That'd be a help.

1184
01:11:15,890 --> 01:11:17,680
- I don't wanna do that, that's your job.

1185
01:11:17,680 --> 01:11:19,380
- Do you think I'm your slave?

1186
01:11:19,380 --> 01:11:21,530
Just because you think
Pa likes you better?

1187
01:11:21,530 --> 01:11:22,590
Do you think I'm gonna do all the chores

1188
01:11:22,590 --> 01:11:24,110
while you sit around with
your nose in some book

1189
01:11:24,110 --> 01:11:25,480
just to get out of workin'?

1190
01:11:25,480 --> 01:11:27,080
- Stop it, Hock.

1191
01:11:27,080 --> 01:11:28,280
He didn't mean anything.

1192
01:11:29,620 --> 01:11:32,461
(birds chirping)

1193
01:11:32,461 --> 01:11:35,211
(horse whinnies)

1194
01:11:43,765 --> 01:11:46,598
(slow soft music)

1195
01:11:47,611 --> 01:11:49,940
(horse whinnies)
- Ow!

1196
01:11:49,940 --> 01:11:50,790
- [Hocking] Charlotte!

1197
01:11:50,790 --> 01:11:52,400
- [Grover] Mama!

1198
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:53,233
Mama!

1199
01:11:54,910 --> 01:11:56,290
Mama, come quick!

1200
01:11:57,950 --> 01:12:00,400
Mama, Hock he spooked a
horse and Charlotte fell.

1201
01:12:02,767 --> 01:12:03,840
(Charlotte crying)

1202
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:05,380
- Shh, where's your father?

1203
01:12:05,380 --> 01:12:07,190
- Saw him cross the
pasture to the Brewster's.

1204
01:12:07,190 --> 01:12:08,240
- Go get him home.

1205
01:12:08,240 --> 01:12:09,310
Come on, sweetie.

1206
01:12:10,930 --> 01:12:12,628
Okay, okay, shh, shh, shh, shh.

1207
01:12:12,628 --> 01:12:14,978
It's all right, it's all
right, it's all right.

1208
01:12:16,641 --> 01:12:18,440
- What's happened to my little girl?

1209
01:12:18,440 --> 01:12:20,830
- It's not as bad as it
looks, she'll be fine.

1210
01:12:20,830 --> 01:12:23,570
- Well then what was the
all-fired hurry to get me here?

1211
01:12:23,570 --> 01:12:25,680
- It's just as well you're here!

1212
01:12:25,680 --> 01:12:27,970
Hocking says Grover poked
the horse with a pitchfork

1213
01:12:27,970 --> 01:12:29,770
and knocked Charlotte off the stool.

1214
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:32,700
- What do you say, Grover?

1215
01:12:32,700 --> 01:12:35,100
- It's not true, Pa, I
wouldn't do such a thing.

1216
01:12:37,150 --> 01:12:38,800
- Charlotte could've been killed.

1217
01:12:39,670 --> 01:12:41,890
He has to understand,
you have to punish him.

1218
01:12:41,890 --> 01:12:43,640
- Charlie, you know what happened?

1219
01:12:43,640 --> 01:12:44,473
- I didn't see.

1220
01:12:45,490 --> 01:12:46,990
- Hock saw.

1221
01:12:46,990 --> 01:12:48,500
- I don't know who's
tellin' the truth here.

1222
01:12:48,500 --> 01:12:50,180
I don't know how you know!

1223
01:12:50,180 --> 01:12:51,280
- Hock doesn't lie!

1224
01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:52,960
- You saying Grover lies?

1225
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:53,860
- Go play outside.

1226
01:13:00,964 --> 01:13:03,714
(birds chirping)

1227
01:13:05,190 --> 01:13:06,200
He does lie, Thomas.

1228
01:13:08,570 --> 01:13:09,910
- I got work waitin' for me.

1229
01:13:09,910 --> 01:13:12,460
I'll have a talk with him
about bein' more careful.

1230
01:13:14,631 --> 01:13:17,400
(cow moos)

1231
01:13:17,400 --> 01:13:19,680
Hock and Charlotte, I
wanna talk to your brother.

1232
01:13:22,500 --> 01:13:24,700
What exactly happened, Grover?

1233
01:13:24,700 --> 01:13:26,500
- Hock don't like it
that the horses like me

1234
01:13:26,500 --> 01:13:27,790
better than they like him.

1235
01:13:27,790 --> 01:13:29,390
He thinks they should like him more

1236
01:13:29,390 --> 01:13:30,940
because he's the one that's gonna grow up

1237
01:13:30,940 --> 01:13:33,060
to be a farmer.
- So what'd he do?

1238
01:13:33,060 --> 01:13:34,920
- He got mad and he jabbed the horses,

1239
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:35,900
but he didn't see Charlotte,

1240
01:13:35,900 --> 01:13:37,450
he never knew she was so close.

1241
01:13:39,740 --> 01:13:41,210
- Are you lyin' to me, Grover?

1242
01:13:41,210 --> 01:13:42,043
- No, sir.

1243
01:13:42,043 --> 01:13:44,931
Cross my heart, hope to die.

1244
01:13:44,931 --> 01:13:49,931
- Okay.
(cow moos)

1245
01:13:51,623 --> 01:13:56,623
(slow dramatic music)
(birds chirping)

1246
01:13:58,485 --> 01:14:01,640
(sighs) Hocking, I don't want you thinking

1247
01:14:01,640 --> 01:14:04,650
you can go through life
tellin' lies to make your way.

1248
01:14:04,650 --> 01:14:06,240
Nobody likes a liar.

1249
01:14:06,240 --> 01:14:07,540
You understand me?

1250
01:14:07,540 --> 01:14:09,030
- Some people do.

1251
01:14:09,030 --> 01:14:10,640
Some people like liars.

1252
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:12,130
- Are you sassin' me, Hock?

1253
01:14:12,130 --> 01:14:13,210
- No, sir.

1254
01:14:13,210 --> 01:14:14,810
- Go on, go back to your chores.

1255
01:14:21,327 --> 01:14:25,119
(slow dramatic music)

1256
01:14:25,119 --> 01:14:27,702
(birds cawing)

1257
01:14:40,464 --> 01:14:43,214
(horse chortles)

1258
01:14:51,007 --> 01:14:53,507
(bird cawing)

1259
01:14:54,352 --> 01:14:55,185
Hello?

1260
01:14:56,661 --> 01:14:58,040
- Mr. Linthorne.

1261
01:14:58,040 --> 01:14:58,873
Jim's not here.

1262
01:15:00,720 --> 01:15:03,380
- Too bad. (laughs)

1263
01:15:03,380 --> 01:15:05,580
Just come to see if he
needs any flour back.

1264
01:15:06,990 --> 01:15:08,340
Goin' to the mill tomorrow.

1265
01:15:09,959 --> 01:15:11,280
- Might look for him in the tavern.

1266
01:15:12,790 --> 01:15:15,990
- Well, I guess I could ask
the mistress of the house.

1267
01:15:15,990 --> 01:15:17,590
- [Lucille] Can't pay for any flour.

1268
01:15:18,860 --> 01:15:20,110
- Don't worry about that.

1269
01:15:21,160 --> 01:15:22,640
I'll put it on account.

1270
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:25,870
Say, 25 pounds?

1271
01:15:27,190 --> 01:15:28,140
- I'm much obliged.

1272
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:33,025
- You like it up here by now?

1273
01:15:33,025 --> 01:15:34,490
- I've always liked it.

1274
01:15:34,490 --> 01:15:36,790
I'll like it better when
we ought more though.

1275
01:15:37,880 --> 01:15:41,090
- Well, don't be afraid
to call in for things.

1276
01:15:42,425 --> 01:15:43,910
Of course, I wouldn't
say that to most folks,

1277
01:15:43,910 --> 01:15:45,660
but you look like you got gumption.

1278
01:15:46,910 --> 01:15:48,510
Right on top of your good looks.

1279
01:15:50,424 --> 01:15:52,360
(slow soft music)

1280
01:15:52,360 --> 01:15:54,818
- Nice to hear a compliment again.

1281
01:15:54,818 --> 01:15:55,718
It's been a while.

1282
01:15:56,890 --> 01:15:59,608
(slow soft music)

1283
01:15:59,608 --> 01:16:03,480
- Well, I guess I'll,

1284
01:16:03,480 --> 01:16:05,210
I'll stop in with that flour.

1285
01:16:07,572 --> 01:16:12,572
(slow soft music)
(birds cawing)

1286
01:16:15,176 --> 01:16:18,530
This should see you through to November.

1287
01:16:18,530 --> 01:16:19,810
Think you can bring in what you need

1288
01:16:19,810 --> 01:16:21,250
for the rest of the winter?

1289
01:16:21,250 --> 01:16:22,600
- Well, I suppose so.

1290
01:16:25,298 --> 01:16:27,649
Oh, hey. (laughs)

1291
01:16:27,649 --> 01:16:30,399
(birds chirping)

1292
01:16:31,643 --> 01:16:33,750
- It's gonna be a hard winter.

1293
01:16:33,750 --> 01:16:34,583
Deep snow.

1294
01:16:35,599 --> 01:16:37,040
Got to get the hay in while you can, Jim.

1295
01:16:37,040 --> 01:16:38,490
- Well, how do you know that?

1296
01:16:39,620 --> 01:16:41,270
- Well, I seen a big hornet's nest

1297
01:16:41,270 --> 01:16:43,880
in a Hackberry tree up on Linthorne Hill.

1298
01:16:43,880 --> 01:16:45,030
Much higher than usual.

1299
01:16:45,970 --> 01:16:46,803
That's the sign.

1300
01:16:50,153 --> 01:16:53,230
That's really fine lookin'
bread, Miss Brewster.

1301
01:16:53,230 --> 01:16:54,940
- That was good flour you brung.

1302
01:16:54,940 --> 01:16:56,860
Thank you for thinkin' of us.

1303
01:16:56,860 --> 01:17:01,070
- Um, I forgot somethin' in the house.

1304
01:17:01,070 --> 01:17:01,910
Just excuse me.

1305
01:17:03,272 --> 01:17:05,560
(crickets chirping)

1306
01:17:05,560 --> 01:17:07,870
- Guess I didn't find all
the whiskey after all.

1307
01:17:09,305 --> 01:17:10,138
- Still drinkin', is he?

1308
01:17:10,138 --> 01:17:11,360
- You gonna throw us off?

1309
01:17:14,386 --> 01:17:15,841
- No.

1310
01:17:15,841 --> 01:17:17,290
I don't think you have
to worry about that.

1311
01:17:18,730 --> 01:17:19,840
- Is it true?

1312
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:20,790
About a bad winter?

1313
01:17:23,992 --> 01:17:24,860
- Well, tell you what,

1314
01:17:25,730 --> 01:17:27,640
one of these days I'll
take you up the hill,

1315
01:17:28,660 --> 01:17:31,200
show the hornet's nest to
you all for your own self.

1316
01:17:31,200 --> 01:17:32,033
How'd that be?

1317
01:17:33,243 --> 01:17:36,243
(crickets chirping)

1318
01:17:37,585 --> 01:17:42,060
(cows mooing)
(milk splattering)

1319
01:17:42,060 --> 01:17:44,330
- Sorry to disturb you, Thomas.

1320
01:17:44,330 --> 01:17:46,500
I'm wonderin', can I borrow the wagon

1321
01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:48,860
and pick up some supplies
I ordered in town?

1322
01:17:50,460 --> 01:17:51,360
- Sure.

1323
01:17:51,360 --> 01:17:53,310
Hitch up the mare, she could use a run.

1324
01:17:54,740 --> 01:17:56,160
- Obliged.

1325
01:17:56,160 --> 01:17:57,830
- Uh, Jim.

1326
01:17:59,464 --> 01:18:01,964
(cows mooing)

1327
01:18:03,560 --> 01:18:06,435
Well, here's a dollar

1328
01:18:06,435 --> 01:18:09,435
in case there's something you
need you can't get on account.

1329
01:18:10,610 --> 01:18:11,650
- Well that's real kind of you.

1330
01:18:11,650 --> 01:18:14,162
- I'll just add it to our reckoning.

1331
01:18:14,162 --> 01:18:16,361
(Jim laughs)

1332
01:18:16,361 --> 01:18:19,528
(slow dramatic music)

1333
01:18:25,719 --> 01:18:26,552
(door closes)

1334
01:18:26,552 --> 01:18:28,470
Anything you need from Lancaster today?

1335
01:18:30,554 --> 01:18:32,030
- Can always use a packet of needles.

1336
01:18:34,070 --> 01:18:35,510
- I'll be goin' in then.

1337
01:18:35,510 --> 01:18:37,170
Don't wait supper for me.

1338
01:18:37,170 --> 01:18:38,003
- Thomas?

1339
01:18:41,124 --> 01:18:42,110
(sighs)

1340
01:18:42,110 --> 01:18:43,567
I'll hang out a lamp for ya.

1341
01:18:44,762 --> 01:18:47,595
(slow soft music)

1342
01:18:58,122 --> 01:19:00,209
(gasps)

1343
01:19:00,209 --> 01:19:02,170
- You got nerve, bargin' in like that.

1344
01:19:02,170 --> 01:19:03,480
Catchin' me such a mess.

1345
01:19:05,010 --> 01:19:06,060
- You look all right.

1346
01:19:07,369 --> 01:19:08,202
- Like this?

1347
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:11,880
- I tell ya why I've come, I was,

1348
01:19:13,500 --> 01:19:16,960
I was thinkin' there wouldn't
come a nicer afternoon

1349
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:18,306
than this to go down

1350
01:19:18,306 --> 01:19:20,270
and see that hornet's nest
I was tellin' you about.

1351
01:19:20,270 --> 01:19:21,170
- A hornet's nest?

1352
01:19:22,530 --> 01:19:23,363
- You remember.

1353
01:19:27,260 --> 01:19:28,560
- I got lot to work to do.

1354
01:19:31,275 --> 01:19:32,108
- Oh, I just,

1355
01:19:33,515 --> 01:19:35,260
I just thought of it is all.

1356
01:19:35,260 --> 01:19:36,510
- How long would it take?

1357
01:19:37,420 --> 01:19:38,253
- Maybe an hour.

1358
01:19:40,410 --> 01:19:42,060
Maybe just a little while longer.

1359
01:19:49,390 --> 01:19:51,050
- Wouldn't wanna be any longer than that.

1360
01:19:55,590 --> 01:19:58,666
(crickets chirping)

1361
01:19:58,666 --> 01:20:00,893
(sighs)

1362
01:20:00,893 --> 01:20:04,060
(slow dramatic music)

1363
01:20:11,830 --> 01:20:13,850
Shouldn't we be comin' to it pretty soon?

1364
01:20:13,850 --> 01:20:15,610
- [Thomas] Oh, don't you worry.

1365
01:20:15,610 --> 01:20:16,910
I'll get you back in time.

1366
01:20:18,860 --> 01:20:20,790
- [Lucille] I don't believe
there is any hornet's nest.

1367
01:20:20,790 --> 01:20:22,340
- Oh just you wait, you'll see.

1368
01:20:24,790 --> 01:20:26,950
- I wouldn't care very
much if there wasn't.

1369
01:20:35,307 --> 01:20:37,890
(birds cawing)

1370
01:20:49,860 --> 01:20:51,810
We better go home.

1371
01:20:51,810 --> 01:20:53,160
Jim could be back any time.

1372
01:20:54,274 --> 01:20:56,330
- He'll be in town till the taverns close.

1373
01:20:57,200 --> 01:20:58,050
I gave him money.

1374
01:21:02,213 --> 01:21:05,380
(slow dramatic music)

1375
01:21:14,754 --> 01:21:17,587
(Lucille panting)

1376
01:21:31,042 --> 01:21:33,792
(Thomas panting)

1377
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:47,873
- Here's Papa.

1378
01:21:49,365 --> 01:21:52,532
(slow dramatic music)

1379
01:21:59,006 --> 01:22:01,589
(Thomas sighs)

1380
01:22:02,548 --> 01:22:05,715
(silverware clinking)

1381
01:22:07,701 --> 01:22:10,118
(cow mooing)

1382
01:22:19,570 --> 01:22:20,900
- Say goodnight to your father.

1383
01:22:22,190 --> 01:22:23,260
- [Thomas] Goodnight, Charlotte.

1384
01:22:23,260 --> 01:22:24,960
- Goodnight, Pa.
- Goodnight, Grover.

1385
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:26,210
- [Grover] Goodnight, Papa.

1386
01:22:27,880 --> 01:22:29,780
- Come on, children,
let's say our prayers.

1387
01:22:29,780 --> 01:22:30,613
- Hocking?

1388
01:22:31,938 --> 01:22:34,938
(crickets chirping)

1389
01:22:36,823 --> 01:22:39,573
(paper rustling)

1390
01:22:45,230 --> 01:22:47,183
I've never known a woman like you.

1391
01:22:48,578 --> 01:22:52,964
- I ain't never known a man like you.

1392
01:22:52,964 --> 01:22:56,113
- You wanna see me again?

1393
01:22:56,113 --> 01:22:58,803
- I wanna give you
everything you ever wanted.

1394
01:22:58,803 --> 01:23:03,803
Everything you never had.

1395
01:23:04,962 --> 01:23:08,155
(birds squawking)
(intense dramatic music)

1396
01:23:08,155 --> 01:23:10,145
It's Jim, come lookin' for me.

1397
01:23:10,145 --> 01:23:11,250
He could have a gun.

1398
01:23:11,250 --> 01:23:13,656
- Shh, come on.

1399
01:23:13,656 --> 01:23:17,073
(intense dramatic music)

1400
01:23:21,121 --> 01:23:26,121
Here we go. (gasps)

1401
01:23:34,034 --> 01:23:36,438
I don't know what you
think you're doin' here.

1402
01:23:36,438 --> 01:23:41,299
- I wanted my babies to see
their father with his whore.

1403
01:23:41,299 --> 01:23:45,399
(intense dramatic music)

1404
01:23:45,399 --> 01:23:48,149
(Thomas panting)

1405
01:23:49,081 --> 01:23:52,081
(crickets chirping)

1406
01:23:55,523 --> 01:23:58,023
(door clicks)

1407
01:24:31,740 --> 01:24:36,318
- I ain't askin' you to forgive me.

1408
01:24:36,318 --> 01:24:39,468
And I ain't askin' you
to keep on goin' with me.

1409
01:24:39,468 --> 01:24:43,135
(crickets chirping)

1410
01:24:43,135 --> 01:24:44,815
I just wanted you to know I been up

1411
01:24:44,815 --> 01:24:47,503
and I told Jim,

1412
01:24:47,503 --> 01:24:50,415
and I gave him his place back.

1413
01:24:50,415 --> 01:24:55,415
Lock, stock, and barrel.

1414
01:24:55,750 --> 01:24:57,485
I don't know whether
it'll make any difference

1415
01:24:57,485 --> 01:25:01,924
between you and me,

1416
01:25:01,924 --> 01:25:06,516
but I'll never set foot on it again.

1417
01:25:06,516 --> 01:25:09,190
- Do you know what you've lost, Thomas?

1418
01:25:09,190 --> 01:25:11,780
(crickets chirping)

1419
01:25:11,780 --> 01:25:14,244
- Kate.

1420
01:25:14,244 --> 01:25:17,478
- What have you got to say to me?

1421
01:25:17,478 --> 01:25:22,478
(slow dramatic music)
(crickets chirping)

1422
01:25:28,719 --> 01:25:33,719
- I got no words, Kate.

1423
01:25:35,258 --> 01:25:40,258
- Go away. (sighs)

1424
01:25:40,815 --> 01:25:44,915
Go sleep in the barn
with the other animals.

1425
01:25:44,915 --> 01:25:49,915
(slow dramatic music)
(crickets chirping)

1426
01:25:55,850 --> 01:25:58,433
(Kate weeping)

1427
01:26:08,579 --> 01:26:10,579
(sighs)

1428
01:26:13,855 --> 01:26:16,355
(ring clangs)

1429
01:26:24,566 --> 01:26:27,336
(lantern rattles)

1430
01:26:27,336 --> 01:26:31,086
(slow soft orchestral music)

1431
01:27:23,347 --> 01:27:24,704
(bell dinging)

1432
01:27:24,704 --> 01:27:28,704
(lighthearted orchestral music)

1433
01:27:29,895 --> 01:27:32,478
(bell dinging)

1434
01:27:38,915 --> 01:27:41,748
(hooves clopping)

1435
01:27:58,556 --> 01:28:01,556
(carriage rattling)

1436
01:28:24,521 --> 01:28:29,521
(moves into dramatic
triumphant orchestral music)

1437
01:28:44,890 --> 01:28:46,320
- Hocking!

1438
01:28:46,320 --> 01:28:47,153
Hock!

1439
01:28:49,020 --> 01:28:51,310
Better get cleaned up now,
Hock, they'll be here soon.

1440
01:28:51,310 --> 01:28:53,080
- You reckon I oughta have a bath?

1441
01:28:53,080 --> 01:28:54,380
- She might appreciate it.

1442
01:28:56,780 --> 01:28:58,230
- Charlotte, wait for me.

1443
01:29:00,780 --> 01:29:02,400
- What is the fifth commandment?

1444
01:29:03,410 --> 01:29:04,510
- Thou shalt not kill.

1445
01:29:06,350 --> 01:29:08,090
- What is the sixth commandment?

1446
01:29:09,460 --> 01:29:11,410
- Thou shalt not commit adultery.

1447
01:29:14,108 --> 01:29:16,303
(knife clinks)

1448
01:29:16,303 --> 01:29:17,470
- And what does this mean?

1449
01:29:17,470 --> 01:29:18,890
- We should fear and love God,

1450
01:29:18,890 --> 01:29:21,560
that we may lead a chaste and decent life,

1451
01:29:21,560 --> 01:29:23,180
in thought, word, and deed.

1452
01:29:24,400 --> 01:29:27,190
And each should love and honor his spouse.

1453
01:29:28,582 --> 01:29:30,510
(sighs) Can I stop now, Pop?

1454
01:29:31,430 --> 01:29:33,530
I know this front to back, back to front.

1455
01:29:33,530 --> 01:29:36,030
- Well, you got to be perfect, Grover.

1456
01:29:36,030 --> 01:29:38,490
You got to bring honor
to the Linthorne name.

1457
01:29:38,490 --> 01:29:40,350
- I know it just as good as Grover.

1458
01:29:40,350 --> 01:29:42,770
- Well, you ought to, you
been tryin' for two years now.

1459
01:29:42,770 --> 01:29:43,640
- That's enough, Grover.

1460
01:29:43,640 --> 01:29:45,960
There's no need to sass
your brother that way.

1461
01:29:45,960 --> 01:29:48,240
- I got more important
things need doin' anyway.

1462
01:29:49,892 --> 01:29:51,040
(Grover laughs)

1463
01:29:51,040 --> 01:29:54,020
- Eugene and Ralph are
bringin' their cousin over.

1464
01:29:54,020 --> 01:29:55,327
Hocking's sweet on her.

1465
01:30:00,010 --> 01:30:02,240
- What's this about some Tannersham girl

1466
01:30:02,240 --> 01:30:04,168
Hocking is sweet on?

1467
01:30:04,168 --> 01:30:05,240
- (sighs) You'll be polite to her, Thomas.

1468
01:30:05,240 --> 01:30:06,640
You won't be startin' any arguments

1469
01:30:06,640 --> 01:30:07,740
with Ralph and Eugene.

1470
01:30:08,850 --> 01:30:09,990
- All this fuss.

1471
01:30:09,990 --> 01:30:11,760
Those hellions are in
the orchards every night,

1472
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:12,593
stealin' apples.

1473
01:30:12,593 --> 01:30:15,150
Here you are layin' on a feast for 'em?

1474
01:30:15,150 --> 01:30:17,940
- It ain't Ralph and
Eugene I'm fussin' for.

1475
01:30:17,940 --> 01:30:19,900
- Well who is she anyway?

1476
01:30:19,900 --> 01:30:21,580
- She's up here visitin' from Sugar Grove

1477
01:30:21,580 --> 01:30:22,530
'cause her pa died.

1478
01:30:23,510 --> 01:30:26,070
Hocking's taken quite a shine
to her, she likes him, too.

1479
01:30:26,070 --> 01:30:27,170
- Where'd he meet her?

1480
01:30:28,690 --> 01:30:29,523
- Church.

1481
01:30:33,440 --> 01:30:36,010
- Sure she'll know you with
all your dirt scraped off?

1482
01:30:36,860 --> 01:30:39,260
- Better not stick your nose in it.

1483
01:30:39,260 --> 01:30:42,220
- Ralph and Eugene are
my friends, you remember?

1484
01:30:42,220 --> 01:30:43,610
- Yeah, that's why they're
always laughing at you

1485
01:30:43,610 --> 01:30:46,010
behind your back.
(horse whinnies)

1486
01:30:46,010 --> 01:30:47,800
She's here already?
- Hey, Charlotte?

1487
01:30:47,800 --> 01:30:49,180
- She couldn't wait to get behind the barn

1488
01:30:49,180 --> 01:30:52,939
with her charming bull,
I mean beau. (laughs)

1489
01:30:52,939 --> 01:30:55,772
(slow soft music)

1490
01:30:56,732 --> 01:30:58,570
(pan clangs)

1491
01:30:58,570 --> 01:31:00,150
- She's a Tannersham all right.

1492
01:31:01,955 --> 01:31:03,700
- Oh, you just don't think
anybody's good enough

1493
01:31:03,700 --> 01:31:05,480
for the Linthornes.

1494
01:31:05,480 --> 01:31:07,120
- [Ralph] Hey, Grover.

1495
01:31:07,120 --> 01:31:08,790
- A man talks straight or he don't.

1496
01:31:08,790 --> 01:31:11,116
Ain't one in that bunch that do.

1497
01:31:11,116 --> 01:31:13,210
(slow soft music)

1498
01:31:13,210 --> 01:31:15,194
- Do I look all right, Ma?

1499
01:31:15,194 --> 01:31:16,810
- [Kate] (sighs) You look fine.

1500
01:31:21,745 --> 01:31:25,185
(woman laughing)

1501
01:31:25,185 --> 01:31:26,600
- I don't like the look
of her one damn bit.

1502
01:31:26,600 --> 01:31:29,130
Tramp if I ever saw one.
(Kate sighs)

1503
01:31:29,130 --> 01:31:31,730
- She's dirt poor hill folk, Thomas.

1504
01:31:31,730 --> 01:31:34,960
She's ignorant and she's
all alone in the world.

1505
01:31:34,960 --> 01:31:37,470
Seems to me you married
a girl just like that.

1506
01:31:37,470 --> 01:31:39,940
- Oh, she don't hold
a candle to you, Kate.

1507
01:31:39,940 --> 01:31:41,260
- Don't make her a tramp.

1508
01:31:41,260 --> 01:31:43,680
She's got a good heart and she likes Hock.

1509
01:31:43,680 --> 01:31:45,090
- Ain't hard to tell about her heart,

1510
01:31:45,090 --> 01:31:47,804
I guess you damn near see
it through that dress.

1511
01:31:47,804 --> 01:31:49,060
(Kate sighs)

1512
01:31:49,060 --> 01:31:50,310
- I wouldn't be encouraging this

1513
01:31:50,310 --> 01:31:52,150
if I didn't approve of her.

1514
01:31:52,150 --> 01:31:54,120
But I guess you know better.

1515
01:31:54,120 --> 01:31:56,120
I guess you're an expert on tramps.

1516
01:31:59,334 --> 01:32:04,334
(slow soft music)
(Thomas groans)

1517
01:32:04,822 --> 01:32:07,860
(Thomas sighs)

1518
01:32:07,860 --> 01:32:12,160
What I said to you, Thomas,

1519
01:32:12,160 --> 01:32:13,660
I'm sorry.

1520
01:32:13,660 --> 01:32:15,230
- It's been 12 years, Kate.

1521
01:32:17,680 --> 01:32:19,630
I've been true to you from that day on.

1522
01:32:21,990 --> 01:32:24,910
Some time you're gonna have to forgive me.

1523
01:32:24,910 --> 01:32:26,010
- I have forgiven you.

1524
01:32:26,920 --> 01:32:27,770
- No you haven't.

1525
01:32:30,360 --> 01:32:32,520
Not deep in your heart you haven't.

1526
01:32:35,593 --> 01:32:37,593
(sighs)

1527
01:32:39,118 --> 01:32:41,951
(hooves thudding)

1528
01:32:44,462 --> 01:32:46,670
You're gonna get your
confirmation suit all dirty.

1529
01:32:46,670 --> 01:32:47,890
- If we drove up to the church

1530
01:32:47,890 --> 01:32:49,450
with the surrey all dusty like this,

1531
01:32:49,450 --> 01:32:51,690
I'd catch hell for it, wouldn't I?

1532
01:32:51,690 --> 01:32:54,010
- You could've done it yesterday.

1533
01:32:54,010 --> 01:32:55,000
- Well, I had the hay to bring in

1534
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,330
from the river field before it got wet.

1535
01:32:57,330 --> 01:32:59,220
Grover could've washed the surrey.

1536
01:32:59,220 --> 01:33:01,320
- Well, Grover had to study his catechism.

1537
01:33:02,680 --> 01:33:04,440
- Well what if I do make as good a show?

1538
01:33:05,370 --> 01:33:06,580
I guess I'll get a gold watch too,

1539
01:33:06,580 --> 01:33:08,280
like you promised Grover, won't I?

1540
01:33:09,790 --> 01:33:11,780
- What do you and me need
with gold watches, son?

1541
01:33:11,780 --> 01:33:12,613
We're farmers.

1542
01:33:14,080 --> 01:33:14,913
Look here,

1543
01:33:17,130 --> 01:33:19,770
that's the kind of watch a farmer needs.

1544
01:33:19,770 --> 01:33:22,550
I don't know how many
cows have stepped on this.

1545
01:33:22,550 --> 01:33:25,350
Grover's going to college, he
needs a college man's watch.

1546
01:33:25,350 --> 01:33:26,183
Simple as that.

1547
01:33:29,610 --> 01:33:32,580
I tell you what, you do us proud

1548
01:33:33,836 --> 01:33:35,410
and I'll give you this old watch of mine.

1549
01:33:36,700 --> 01:33:38,770
- You mean that, Pop?
- Of course I do, Hock.

1550
01:33:38,770 --> 01:33:40,120
You know I mean what I say.

1551
01:33:41,366 --> 01:33:42,690
- I know that, sir, yes I do.

1552
01:33:42,690 --> 01:33:43,800
- Now go on up to the house

1553
01:33:43,800 --> 01:33:46,930
and get that dust out of
that fancy catalog suit

1554
01:33:46,930 --> 01:33:48,330
before your mother sees you.

1555
01:33:49,406 --> 01:33:52,239
(slow soft music)

1556
01:33:57,534 --> 01:34:00,534
(crickets chirping)

1557
01:34:07,086 --> 01:34:10,086
(people chattering)

1558
01:34:20,730 --> 01:34:21,760
- What is religion?

1559
01:34:23,340 --> 01:34:25,040
Hocking Linthorne.

1560
01:34:25,040 --> 01:34:27,120
You're the oldest one here today.

1561
01:34:27,120 --> 01:34:28,670
You've had the time and the seasoning

1562
01:34:28,670 --> 01:34:31,320
to think about the meaning
in the words of this book.

1563
01:34:32,220 --> 01:34:33,520
Perhaps you could tell us.

1564
01:34:35,090 --> 01:34:35,923
- Religion?

1565
01:34:39,790 --> 01:34:41,040
That weren't in the book.

1566
01:34:43,600 --> 01:34:44,510
- Anyone else?

1567
01:34:46,340 --> 01:34:49,320
- Religion is what you believe about God.

1568
01:34:50,200 --> 01:34:52,800
Religion is the way a
man worships his God.

1569
01:34:53,920 --> 01:34:55,170
- Well spoken, young man.

1570
01:34:59,330 --> 01:35:03,140
As you all know, I like to
give each child confirmed

1571
01:35:03,140 --> 01:35:06,930
into our faith an individual
confirmation verse,

1572
01:35:06,930 --> 01:35:10,810
which I hope will guide them
in the course of their lives.

1573
01:35:12,340 --> 01:35:16,840
For Grover Linthorne, I
choose the following verse.

1574
01:35:18,350 --> 01:35:21,200
"For God shall bring
every work into judgment,

1575
01:35:21,200 --> 01:35:24,010
whether it be good or whether it be evil."

1576
01:35:27,162 --> 01:35:29,995
(slow soft music)

1577
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:32,320
- [Kate] Thank you.

1578
01:35:32,320 --> 01:35:35,917
You know my daughter Charlotte.

1579
01:35:35,917 --> 01:35:38,157
- [Man] (laughs) He can't lift that bell.

1580
01:35:38,157 --> 01:35:39,490
- (grunting and groaning) Oh!

1581
01:35:39,490 --> 01:35:41,260
Ooh, did you see that?

1582
01:35:41,260 --> 01:35:42,990
I budged it two inches!

1583
01:35:42,990 --> 01:35:44,860
Two inches I budged it!

1584
01:35:44,860 --> 01:35:46,890
- You ain't never budged it, Ralph.

1585
01:35:46,890 --> 01:35:48,890
- Well I did so, I moved it two inches.

1586
01:35:48,890 --> 01:35:51,440
Look here, I got the blister
right there to prove it.

1587
01:35:51,440 --> 01:35:52,560
- I got blisters on my hands

1588
01:35:52,560 --> 01:35:54,130
and I ain't even touched it yet.

1589
01:35:54,130 --> 01:35:55,290
- Why don't you try, Hock?

1590
01:35:55,290 --> 01:35:56,680
You can do it if anybody can.

1591
01:35:56,680 --> 01:35:58,230
Remember what you told me
about movin' that stone

1592
01:35:58,230 --> 01:35:59,720
even your pa couldn't lift?

1593
01:35:59,720 --> 01:36:00,553
Come on.

1594
01:36:01,459 --> 01:36:02,330
- [Luke] (laughs) I
guess you ain't the man

1595
01:36:02,330 --> 01:36:04,300
you used to be, Linthorne.

1596
01:36:06,956 --> 01:36:09,956
(audience clapping)

1597
01:36:11,222 --> 01:36:12,875
(bell clangs)

1598
01:36:12,875 --> 01:36:17,875
(audience clapping)
(people chattering)

1599
01:36:22,774 --> 01:36:25,419
- Don't do it, Thomas.

1600
01:36:25,419 --> 01:36:28,066
Let him have the better of it for once.

1601
01:36:28,066 --> 01:36:30,899
(slow soft music)

1602
01:36:35,865 --> 01:36:37,020
- I guess a man can be excused

1603
01:36:37,020 --> 01:36:39,560
if he gives over some of the heaviest work

1604
01:36:39,560 --> 01:36:41,724
to his oldest son, can't he?

1605
01:36:41,724 --> 01:36:46,724
(audience clapping)
(people chattering)

1606
01:36:51,860 --> 01:36:54,527
(bell clanging)

1607
01:37:03,702 --> 01:37:05,690
(audience clapping)

1608
01:37:05,690 --> 01:37:08,010
- [Luke] Who is that?

1609
01:37:08,010 --> 01:37:10,153
- I've never seen him before.

1610
01:37:10,153 --> 01:37:11,300
- Want me to find out, Mama?

1611
01:37:11,300 --> 01:37:12,920
- You never mind who he is.

1612
01:37:12,920 --> 01:37:15,770
Just some drifter showing off
for a free meal and a bunk.

1613
01:37:18,258 --> 01:37:20,060
(people chattering)
(crickets chirping)

1614
01:37:20,060 --> 01:37:21,090
- Excuse me, ladies.

1615
01:37:22,980 --> 01:37:23,980
Linthorne's my name.

1616
01:37:25,228 --> 01:37:26,330
I don't reckon you'd have much objection

1617
01:37:26,330 --> 01:37:27,660
of lettin' me know yours?

1618
01:37:27,660 --> 01:37:29,000
- Sarple.

1619
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:29,833
Jed, sir.

1620
01:37:30,830 --> 01:37:32,950
- Wouldn't be hirin' on
for the season, would you?

1621
01:37:32,950 --> 01:37:34,510
- How much you payin'?

1622
01:37:34,510 --> 01:37:36,810
- I reckon $15 a month and
board would be about right.

1623
01:37:36,810 --> 01:37:38,000
Wouldn't it?

1624
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:39,120
- I'll think on it.

1625
01:37:39,120 --> 01:37:41,100
I'm obliged to you for offerin'.

1626
01:37:41,100 --> 01:37:42,827
- [Kate] Time to be goin'.

1627
01:37:42,827 --> 01:37:43,660
- So soon, Mama?

1628
01:37:44,817 --> 01:37:46,770
(slow soft music)
(crickets chirping)

1629
01:37:46,770 --> 01:37:47,603
- Right now.

1630
01:37:49,936 --> 01:37:52,936
(people chattering)

1631
01:37:54,839 --> 01:37:55,810
- [Thomas] What is it, Spence?

1632
01:37:59,260 --> 01:38:00,210
- I've been robbed.

1633
01:38:01,520 --> 01:38:03,520
I had $300 in my coat pocket.

1634
01:38:03,520 --> 01:38:04,580
- What?

1635
01:38:04,580 --> 01:38:05,630
Right here in church?

1636
01:38:06,730 --> 01:38:09,790
Oh, took a real sneaky
son of a bitch to do it.

1637
01:38:11,535 --> 01:38:16,535
(people chattering)
(slow soft music)

1638
01:38:24,120 --> 01:38:25,640
You earned it, son.

1639
01:38:25,640 --> 01:38:27,510
Never had a prouder day in my life.

1640
01:38:30,393 --> 01:38:33,143
(birds chirping)

1641
01:38:34,473 --> 01:38:36,580
And I'm proud of you too, Hock.

1642
01:38:36,580 --> 01:38:37,590
You tried your best.

1643
01:38:38,910 --> 01:38:40,300
Guess you and me were just meant

1644
01:38:40,300 --> 01:38:42,530
to walk behind a plow through this life.

1645
01:38:47,890 --> 01:38:51,130
- There's an ice cream
social tonight, in Royalton.

1646
01:38:51,130 --> 01:38:52,680
You mind if I go show it off?

1647
01:38:52,680 --> 01:38:53,650
- Sure.

1648
01:38:53,650 --> 01:38:55,260
I can't give you any money though.

1649
01:38:55,260 --> 01:38:58,320
I loaned all my ready
cash to Spence today.

1650
01:38:58,320 --> 01:38:59,980
- Wasn't all your fault
that he left all his money

1651
01:38:59,980 --> 01:39:01,260
in his coat pocket.

1652
01:39:01,260 --> 01:39:02,210
- He needed it.

1653
01:39:02,210 --> 01:39:04,080
He pays his hands on Sunday.

1654
01:39:04,080 --> 01:39:06,520
Anyway, fault doesn't come into it.

1655
01:39:06,520 --> 01:39:09,290
He's a friend of mine,
friend of this family.

1656
01:39:09,290 --> 01:39:11,460
- Well, I'm all right for money.

1657
01:39:11,460 --> 01:39:12,760
Been savin' up my nickels.

1658
01:39:16,305 --> 01:39:18,948
(horse whinnies)

1659
01:39:18,948 --> 01:39:21,948
(crickets chirping)

1660
01:39:28,510 --> 01:39:29,620
- Something botherin' you, son?

1661
01:39:29,620 --> 01:39:31,280
- You said I'd have your watch.

1662
01:39:33,323 --> 01:39:35,814
Thought I was gonna get it
along with Grover at supper.

1663
01:39:35,814 --> 01:39:37,310
- I know what I said and so do you.

1664
01:39:38,487 --> 01:39:40,340
I said you do us proud
and I'd give you my watch.

1665
01:39:40,340 --> 01:39:41,640
Isn't that what I said?

1666
01:39:41,640 --> 01:39:43,630
- I got nervous after Reverend
called on me like that,

1667
01:39:43,630 --> 01:39:45,290
but I knew the regular catechism.

1668
01:39:46,850 --> 01:39:48,770
- You do me proud, Hock, just once,

1669
01:39:48,770 --> 01:39:51,270
really proud, and I
will give you my watch.

1670
01:39:52,710 --> 01:39:55,690
- I don't know what I need a
banged up old watch for anyhow.

1671
01:39:58,450 --> 01:40:01,450
(crickets chirping)

1672
01:40:02,579 --> 01:40:05,251
(slow dramatic music)

1673
01:40:05,251 --> 01:40:06,600
- [Ralph] Hey, ain't that Grover?

1674
01:40:12,500 --> 01:40:14,070
- Hey.
- Whoa.

1675
01:40:15,480 --> 01:40:19,110
- Can I go into Royalton
with you and Eugene, Ralph?

1676
01:40:19,110 --> 01:40:20,380
- Who'd wanna ride to the social

1677
01:40:20,380 --> 01:40:23,890
with some little farm boy
who don't even shave yet?

1678
01:40:24,796 --> 01:40:25,629
- I got money.

1679
01:40:27,430 --> 01:40:29,290
- Where'd you come by that money?

1680
01:40:29,290 --> 01:40:30,760
- Found it.

1681
01:40:30,760 --> 01:40:32,110
- Sure you did.

1682
01:40:32,110 --> 01:40:34,917
I believe you, I do, just
like I believe in Santa Claus.

1683
01:40:34,917 --> 01:40:36,830
(laughs)

1684
01:40:36,830 --> 01:40:38,590
- Eugene, get in the back.

1685
01:40:41,040 --> 01:40:42,990
We should go to the gypsy camp, Grover.

1686
01:40:44,818 --> 01:40:48,850
(soft lighthearted music)

1687
01:40:48,850 --> 01:40:50,100
Heeyah, heeyah.

1688
01:40:51,116 --> 01:40:52,950
Now we can have a whole lot
more fun with that kind of money

1689
01:40:52,950 --> 01:40:54,440
than some ice cream social.

1690
01:40:55,650 --> 01:40:57,330
It's easy once you get to know 'em, kid.

1691
01:40:57,330 --> 01:40:59,970
All you gotta do is act
like you ain't a green horn.

1692
01:40:59,970 --> 01:41:01,210
My god.

1693
01:41:01,210 --> 01:41:04,332
If I had a dollar for
every woman I laid with,

1694
01:41:04,332 --> 01:41:07,637
(laughs) I'd be a millionaire.

1695
01:41:07,637 --> 01:41:10,242
(women cackling)

1696
01:41:10,242 --> 01:41:12,992
(Ralph cackling)

1697
01:41:15,200 --> 01:41:16,190
Hey, Caliope!

1698
01:41:17,210 --> 01:41:18,360
Whoa!

1699
01:41:18,360 --> 01:41:19,410
Look what I brung ya.

1700
01:41:20,402 --> 01:41:22,194
(laughs)

1701
01:41:22,194 --> 01:41:26,155
(women laughing)
(slow soft music)

1702
01:41:26,155 --> 01:41:29,155
(crickets chirping)

1703
01:41:33,267 --> 01:41:34,100
- Hi, Pop.

1704
01:41:35,150 --> 01:41:36,720
Sorry I'm late.

1705
01:41:36,720 --> 01:41:37,680
Social was swell.

1706
01:41:40,010 --> 01:41:41,170
- Don't you lie to me!

1707
01:41:45,340 --> 01:41:48,770
Since when do they serve
whiskey at ice cream socials?

1708
01:41:48,770 --> 01:41:51,260
Since when do they go on
all hours of the night?

1709
01:41:51,260 --> 01:41:53,760
- I'm sorry, Pop. (sighs)

1710
01:41:55,240 --> 01:41:56,800
Ralph and Eugene showed up.

1711
01:41:58,190 --> 01:42:02,190
And they had a bottle and
they made me have a drink.

1712
01:42:03,070 --> 01:42:03,960
For celebration.

1713
01:42:06,050 --> 01:42:10,010
And, I guess I just had
a little bit too much.

1714
01:42:11,790 --> 01:42:13,090
- Remember what this says?

1715
01:42:14,350 --> 01:42:15,200
- [Grover] Yes, sir.

1716
01:42:16,340 --> 01:42:19,930
- "For God shall bring
every work into judgment,

1717
01:42:19,930 --> 01:42:21,850
with every secret thing,
whether it be good

1718
01:42:21,850 --> 01:42:23,460
or whether it be evil."

1719
01:42:23,460 --> 01:42:25,360
You know what that means?
- Yes, Pop.

1720
01:42:28,625 --> 01:42:31,670
It means you can't hide
nothin' from the sight of God.

1721
01:42:31,670 --> 01:42:33,510
- You never know where
drinkin's gonna lead you

1722
01:42:33,510 --> 01:42:35,190
but it won't be nowhere good.

1723
01:42:35,190 --> 01:42:37,590
I want you to stay the
hell away from those two!

1724
01:42:39,890 --> 01:42:40,723
You promise me.

1725
01:42:42,147 --> 01:42:43,350
- I promise.

1726
01:42:43,350 --> 01:42:45,300
- You're my hope in this world, Grover.

1727
01:42:46,730 --> 01:42:50,390
Don't ever forget that.
(slow soft music)

1728
01:42:51,316 --> 01:42:54,316
(crickets chirping)

1729
01:43:04,490 --> 01:43:05,930
Goodnight, son.

1730
01:43:05,930 --> 01:43:06,780
- Goodnight, Pop.

1731
01:43:14,080 --> 01:43:15,910
- Beautiful, isn't it?

1732
01:43:15,910 --> 01:43:17,690
I love the meadows in summer.

1733
01:43:19,030 --> 01:43:20,610
The abundance of everything.

1734
01:43:22,580 --> 01:43:24,300
The earth offers us so much more

1735
01:43:24,300 --> 01:43:27,270
than we think to ask of it.

1736
01:43:27,270 --> 01:43:29,385
Swells the heart, don't it?

1737
01:43:29,385 --> 01:43:30,240
- [Charlotte] (laughs) Yes, Papa.

1738
01:43:32,058 --> 01:43:33,910
- I am so proud of you, Charlotte.

1739
01:43:33,910 --> 01:43:35,690
Graduating third in your class.

1740
01:43:37,440 --> 01:43:39,300
You gonna be a fine teacher.

1741
01:43:39,300 --> 01:43:40,480
- I hope so.

1742
01:43:40,480 --> 01:43:42,310
- We should have a celebration.

1743
01:43:42,310 --> 01:43:44,098
Like a party maybe.

1744
01:43:44,098 --> 01:43:45,500
- (laughs) A party, for me?

1745
01:43:45,500 --> 01:43:47,133
- You deserve it.

1746
01:43:47,133 --> 01:43:49,140
You could have all the
young folks here about.

1747
01:43:49,140 --> 01:43:50,680
Lotus and Adolf Sipooni,

1748
01:43:50,680 --> 01:43:54,361
and I guess we have to
invite the Tannershams.

1749
01:43:54,361 --> 01:43:55,608
(Charlotte laughs)

1750
01:43:55,608 --> 01:43:56,608
And Judith Brewster.

1751
01:43:57,930 --> 01:43:58,980
- But she's so young.

1752
01:44:00,169 --> 01:44:01,440
- Well, none of us know her very much,

1753
01:44:01,440 --> 01:44:03,530
despite her growin' up a neighbor.

1754
01:44:03,530 --> 01:44:06,500
Jim and Lucille, they
keep her so close to home.

1755
01:44:06,500 --> 01:44:08,460
Might be a nice chance for
her to meet some young folks.

1756
01:44:08,460 --> 01:44:09,293
Don't you think?

1757
01:44:10,900 --> 01:44:12,550
- I thought this was a party for me?

1758
01:44:12,550 --> 01:44:14,200
- Oh, of course it is, Charlotte.

1759
01:44:15,325 --> 01:44:16,680
I'm just tryin' to be neighborly.

1760
01:44:17,731 --> 01:44:19,670
(slow soft music)

1761
01:44:19,670 --> 01:44:21,370
- It's asking for trouble, Thomas.

1762
01:44:22,740 --> 01:44:24,810
- Looks worse leavin' her out.

1763
01:44:24,810 --> 01:44:27,010
- She's gonna start the
talk all over again.

1764
01:44:29,150 --> 01:44:29,983
- Let 'em talk.

1765
01:44:30,923 --> 01:44:32,420
I don't give a damn.

1766
01:44:32,420 --> 01:44:34,410
- What is it you want with her?

1767
01:44:34,410 --> 01:44:36,050
Hm?

1768
01:44:36,050 --> 01:44:37,320
Do you even know?

1769
01:44:38,823 --> 01:44:43,247
(slow soft music)
(crickets chirping)

1770
01:44:43,247 --> 01:44:48,247
(people chattering)
("Skip to My Lou")

1771
01:45:11,848 --> 01:45:14,857
(audience clapping)

1772
01:45:14,857 --> 01:45:17,857
(lively folk music)

1773
01:45:19,548 --> 01:45:20,381
- Judith.

1774
01:45:21,480 --> 01:45:22,657
How lovely you look.

1775
01:45:22,657 --> 01:45:23,662
- Thank you.

1776
01:45:23,662 --> 01:45:24,880
- Would you like some punch?

1777
01:45:29,600 --> 01:45:32,430
Mark, Abigail, this is Judith.

1778
01:45:32,430 --> 01:45:33,270
- [Judith] Hello.

1779
01:45:34,570 --> 01:45:37,020
- And I think you know my
husband, Mr. Linthorne.

1780
01:45:38,620 --> 01:45:39,720
- Hello, Judith.

1781
01:45:39,720 --> 01:45:42,351
- Thank you for havin'
me to your party, sir.

1782
01:45:42,351 --> 01:45:43,880
I never been to a party before.

1783
01:45:43,880 --> 01:45:46,220
- Well, you're welcome here any time.

1784
01:45:51,470 --> 01:45:52,870
- Surprised you invited her.

1785
01:45:54,270 --> 01:45:56,260
- Why should it surprise you?

1786
01:45:56,260 --> 01:45:57,840
- Oh, you know.

1787
01:45:57,840 --> 01:45:59,140
What people say about her.

1788
01:46:01,850 --> 01:46:03,180
Oh, Charlotte.

1789
01:46:05,296 --> 01:46:10,296
(people chattering)
(lively folk music)

1790
01:46:16,980 --> 01:46:17,813
Hey, Judy.

1791
01:46:18,790 --> 01:46:20,150
How's your mama?

1792
01:46:20,150 --> 01:46:21,920
How come she ain't here?

1793
01:46:21,920 --> 01:46:24,670
- Bet old tomcat Linthorne's
got a dance saved for her.

1794
01:46:26,890 --> 01:46:29,132
- Boo!
(Judith shrieks)

1795
01:46:29,132 --> 01:46:30,379
- [Man] Look out!

1796
01:46:30,379 --> 01:46:35,379
(Judith screaming)
(slow dramatic music)

1797
01:46:37,069 --> 01:46:37,902
- [Thomas] It's all right.

1798
01:46:37,902 --> 01:46:38,820
It's gonna be all right.

1799
01:46:39,920 --> 01:46:40,753
Sorry.

1800
01:46:42,375 --> 01:46:45,287
Sorry.
(Judith crying)

1801
01:46:45,287 --> 01:46:48,037
(Thomas gasping)

1802
01:47:00,283 --> 01:47:01,116
Whoa.

1803
01:47:04,931 --> 01:47:07,681
(birds chirping)

1804
01:47:09,031 --> 01:47:10,292
Here.

1805
01:47:10,292 --> 01:47:11,875
- [Judith] Oh, you
don't have to see me in.

1806
01:47:11,875 --> 01:47:12,708
- You certain?

1807
01:47:13,860 --> 01:47:17,030
You want me to explain what
happened to your dress, I will.

1808
01:47:17,030 --> 01:47:18,180
- Goodbye, Mr. Linthorne.

1809
01:47:18,180 --> 01:47:19,780
Thanks for what you've done.

1810
01:47:21,460 --> 01:47:23,210
- You're a fine young lady, Judith.

1811
01:47:25,480 --> 01:47:26,480
I wish I-
- Judith!

1812
01:47:28,351 --> 01:47:31,184
(slow soft music)

1813
01:47:32,675 --> 01:47:35,425
(birds chirping)

1814
01:47:38,513 --> 01:47:40,069
Judith, are you all right?

1815
01:47:40,069 --> 01:47:40,983
What on earth happened?
- I'm all right.

1816
01:47:42,840 --> 01:47:45,516
But, mama, I ruined your dress.

1817
01:47:45,516 --> 01:47:47,883
I'm sorry.

1818
01:47:47,883 --> 01:47:50,716
(Thomas groaning)

1819
01:47:56,365 --> 01:47:58,180
- I been thinkin'.

1820
01:47:58,180 --> 01:48:00,680
I'd be willing to carve
out a quarter section

1821
01:48:01,550 --> 01:48:02,383
and put it in your name.

1822
01:48:02,383 --> 01:48:04,390
Good bottom down by the river.

1823
01:48:04,390 --> 01:48:05,600
- Why you wanna do that?

1824
01:48:05,600 --> 01:48:07,800
- All you got to do is
find the right woman.

1825
01:48:09,510 --> 01:48:12,050
You get the girl and I'll see to it

1826
01:48:12,050 --> 01:48:14,150
you won't ever have to
want for a little farm.

1827
01:48:14,150 --> 01:48:15,000
- I got the girl.

1828
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:17,480
- She ain't right for this family.

1829
01:48:17,480 --> 01:48:18,720
- It ain't you she'd be marrying.

1830
01:48:18,720 --> 01:48:20,570
- This family's come a long way.

1831
01:48:20,570 --> 01:48:21,890
Your brother's gonna be a lawyer,

1832
01:48:21,890 --> 01:48:24,070
maybe even run for public office one day.

1833
01:48:24,070 --> 01:48:26,080
Why would you wanna bring
a woman like that into it?

1834
01:48:26,080 --> 01:48:28,380
What kind of raisin' is
she gonna give your kids?

1835
01:48:30,055 --> 01:48:34,029
(slow dramatic music)

1836
01:48:34,029 --> 01:48:36,775
(Thomas groans)

1837
01:48:36,775 --> 01:48:37,760
(rat squeals)

1838
01:48:37,760 --> 01:48:38,893
Get out of there.

1839
01:48:43,059 --> 01:48:45,809
(birds chirping)

1840
01:48:55,323 --> 01:48:57,740
(can clanks)

1841
01:49:05,639 --> 01:49:08,806
(slow dramatic music)

1842
01:49:12,586 --> 01:49:14,586
(sighs)

1843
01:49:16,364 --> 01:49:19,531
(silverware clinking)

1844
01:49:23,350 --> 01:49:25,220
Caught a rat up in the loft today.

1845
01:49:27,030 --> 01:49:28,480
I'll set some traps tomorrow.

1846
01:49:30,230 --> 01:49:33,470
First I guess I gotta clean
everything out of there.

1847
01:49:33,470 --> 01:49:35,630
- Suppose you want me to do it?

1848
01:49:35,630 --> 01:49:37,282
- No.

1849
01:49:37,282 --> 01:49:38,980
I'll take care of it myself.

1850
01:49:38,980 --> 01:49:39,930
- May I be excused?

1851
01:49:42,950 --> 01:49:44,280
Get a book from (indistinct).

1852
01:49:47,368 --> 01:49:48,768
- Don't be late.
- I won't.

1853
01:49:51,640 --> 01:49:52,800
- Yup.

1854
01:49:52,800 --> 01:49:54,300
I'm gonna clean out that loft.

1855
01:49:55,990 --> 01:49:57,310
First thing in the mornin'.

1856
01:49:58,728 --> 01:50:00,070
- Are you all right, Thomas?

1857
01:50:01,330 --> 01:50:03,380
- Guess I'll head over to Spence's house.

1858
01:50:05,612 --> 01:50:07,162
Got some business to talk over.

1859
01:50:08,580 --> 01:50:11,747
(slow dramatic music)

1860
01:50:13,534 --> 01:50:16,034
(owl hooting)

1861
01:50:37,040 --> 01:50:40,000
I guess it shouldn't surprise
me you'd go this low.

1862
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,010
But it does just the same, Hock!

1863
01:50:46,612 --> 01:50:48,180
- [Grover] It was just me.

1864
01:50:48,180 --> 01:50:49,290
- Grover?

1865
01:50:49,290 --> 01:50:50,123
- What?

1866
01:50:52,430 --> 01:50:54,397
- Is this what you're lookin' for?

1867
01:50:54,397 --> 01:50:55,430
Hm?

1868
01:50:55,430 --> 01:50:56,263
A thief?

1869
01:50:57,920 --> 01:50:59,130
A common thief?

1870
01:50:59,970 --> 01:51:02,950
Is that what I raised you up
in this family to be, huh?

1871
01:51:02,950 --> 01:51:04,250
Get over here!
- Pop, no!

1872
01:51:05,320 --> 01:51:06,770
- [Thomas] Huh?

1873
01:51:06,770 --> 01:51:11,770
(whip cracking)
(Grover gasping)

1874
01:51:13,010 --> 01:51:13,843
- [Hocking] Pa!

1875
01:51:16,292 --> 01:51:18,490
- Give me my crop back!
- No!

1876
01:51:18,490 --> 01:51:20,272
You're gonna kill him.

1877
01:51:20,272 --> 01:51:22,193
(Kate gasping)

1878
01:51:22,193 --> 01:51:23,990
- What have you done, Thomas?

1879
01:51:23,990 --> 01:51:25,140
- I whipped him.

1880
01:51:25,140 --> 01:51:25,973
- Why?

1881
01:51:25,973 --> 01:51:27,000
- Because he needed it!

1882
01:51:27,850 --> 01:51:29,839
Stole Spence's money!

1883
01:51:29,839 --> 01:51:32,730
- Thomas.

1884
01:51:32,730 --> 01:51:34,030
- Get him up to the house.

1885
01:51:49,560 --> 01:51:51,460
How could he shame us like that?

1886
01:51:52,440 --> 01:51:53,273
- How?

1887
01:51:54,400 --> 01:51:55,790
You ask me how?

1888
01:51:58,010 --> 01:52:00,020
The way you treat him!

1889
01:52:00,020 --> 01:52:02,630
Like he was some prince!

1890
01:52:04,960 --> 01:52:07,270
He's what you made him, Thomas.

1891
01:52:07,270 --> 01:52:09,130
He thinks anything he wants,

1892
01:52:09,130 --> 01:52:12,170
all he gotta do is reach and take it.

1893
01:52:14,053 --> 01:52:17,053
(crickets chirping)

1894
01:52:18,029 --> 01:52:20,862
(slow soft music)

1895
01:52:21,919 --> 01:52:25,118
(Thomas sighs)

1896
01:52:25,118 --> 01:52:26,168
- My heart is broken.

1897
01:52:28,899 --> 01:52:31,316
(Kate sighs)

1898
01:52:35,157 --> 01:52:37,740
(Kate weeping)

1899
01:52:50,503 --> 01:52:52,836
(can opens)

1900
01:52:55,659 --> 01:52:58,659
(Grover whimpering)

1901
01:53:01,920 --> 01:53:03,620
- You were right to whip me, Papa.

1902
01:53:06,530 --> 01:53:10,490
I had a whippin' comin',
just like you said.

1903
01:53:15,309 --> 01:53:16,142
I'm sorry.

1904
01:53:17,430 --> 01:53:18,380
I'm sorry I did it.

1905
01:53:21,290 --> 01:53:22,650
I'll never steal again.

1906
01:53:24,101 --> 01:53:25,350
I swear.

1907
01:53:25,350 --> 01:53:27,660
- I could be a long time
forgivin' you, Grover.

1908
01:53:29,893 --> 01:53:32,170
But I believe you
understand what you've done.

1909
01:53:33,981 --> 01:53:35,181
You remember this night.

1910
01:53:37,100 --> 01:53:38,800
And I won't ever mention it again.

1911
01:53:40,242 --> 01:53:45,242
(slow somber music)
(crickets chirping)

1912
01:53:58,218 --> 01:54:00,218
(sighs)

1913
01:54:02,821 --> 01:54:06,738
I never thought you'd
touch me like that again.

1914
01:54:10,019 --> 01:54:12,686
(Thomas laughs)

1915
01:54:21,413 --> 01:54:26,413
(people chattering)
(equipment rumbling)

1916
01:54:31,370 --> 01:54:33,804
- [Man] Well, good
afternoon, Mr. Linthorne.

1917
01:54:33,804 --> 01:54:35,150
- [Thomas] What time you reckon to finish?

1918
01:54:35,150 --> 01:54:36,813
- [Man] At the rate we're goin',

1919
01:54:36,813 --> 01:54:38,732
we should finish this field by eight.

1920
01:54:38,732 --> 01:54:43,732
- Fine.

1921
01:54:52,717 --> 01:54:55,300
(girl shrieks)

1922
01:54:58,870 --> 01:55:01,080
I won't have it, Hocking,
that girl ain't decent.

1923
01:55:01,080 --> 01:55:03,580
- Seems to me you ain't
one to talk about decent.

1924
01:55:03,580 --> 01:55:04,970
At least she ain't
married to somebody else,

1925
01:55:04,970 --> 01:55:06,430
and I ain't either.

1926
01:55:06,430 --> 01:55:08,170
- You got no call to talk to me that way,

1927
01:55:08,170 --> 01:55:10,357
I been good to you, haven't I?

1928
01:55:10,357 --> 01:55:11,940
- I don't call it good to
make me do all the dirty work

1929
01:55:11,940 --> 01:55:14,860
while everybody else keeps
his hands clean, do you?

1930
01:55:14,860 --> 01:55:16,340
Don't call it good
never to give me a penny

1931
01:55:16,340 --> 01:55:19,270
without me goin' down on
my knees for it and beg.

1932
01:55:19,270 --> 01:55:21,990
I don't call it good to
try and run my whole life.

1933
01:55:21,990 --> 01:55:23,150
I guess if I'm old enough to vote,

1934
01:55:23,150 --> 01:55:25,280
I'm old enough to pick
the girl I wanna marry.

1935
01:55:25,280 --> 01:55:27,280
- You marry that girl and you'll get out.

1936
01:55:27,280 --> 01:55:29,890
I won't have her around
here, wife or no wife.

1937
01:55:29,890 --> 01:55:32,750
- I can't marry her, I'll get out anyhow.

1938
01:55:32,750 --> 01:55:33,650
- I won't have it!

1939
01:55:34,910 --> 01:55:37,160
I meant what I say and
I want you to know it!

1940
01:55:39,656 --> 01:55:40,620
Come on.

1941
01:55:45,092 --> 01:55:47,842
(birds chirping)

1942
01:55:53,630 --> 01:55:54,820
- Well, we're hitched.

1943
01:55:58,300 --> 01:56:00,300
- What are you aimin' to do?

1944
01:56:00,300 --> 01:56:01,150
- Farm, I reckon.

1945
01:56:03,340 --> 01:56:04,173
- Farm where?

1946
01:56:05,410 --> 01:56:07,270
- That's up to you, I guess.

1947
01:56:07,270 --> 01:56:10,230
- What he means is we
ain't got no planses yet.

1948
01:56:10,230 --> 01:56:11,610
- You know what I told you, Hocking.

1949
01:56:11,610 --> 01:56:13,210
I meant every single word of it.

1950
01:56:14,260 --> 01:56:16,040
- Every word of what?

1951
01:56:16,040 --> 01:56:17,450
What have you said to him?

1952
01:56:17,450 --> 01:56:19,410
- You ain't bein' fair, Pop Linthorne.

1953
01:56:19,410 --> 01:56:20,670
- See, I told you he'd be like that.

1954
01:56:20,670 --> 01:56:23,710
He can't be the boss of
everything, he gets mad.

1955
01:56:23,710 --> 01:56:25,310
You don't have to tell me twice.

1956
01:56:26,379 --> 01:56:29,212
(slow soft music)

1957
01:56:31,860 --> 01:56:32,693
- Hock!

1958
01:56:33,670 --> 01:56:34,503
Hock.

1959
01:56:39,046 --> 01:56:44,046
(door slams)
(slow soft music)

1960
01:56:50,010 --> 01:56:52,640
You didn't ask me if I
wanted him thrown off!

1961
01:56:52,640 --> 01:56:55,150
- He defied me, Kate!
- He loves her!

1962
01:56:55,150 --> 01:56:56,580
- Enough!

1963
01:56:56,580 --> 01:56:58,050
I don't wanna hear his name mentioned

1964
01:56:58,050 --> 01:56:59,740
in this house ever again!

1965
01:56:59,740 --> 01:57:01,700
Do you all understand me?

1966
01:57:01,700 --> 01:57:02,533
- Yes, Pop.

1967
01:57:09,942 --> 01:57:12,578
(birds cawing)

1968
01:57:12,578 --> 01:57:14,495
- [Jed] Thank you, sir.

1969
01:57:16,130 --> 01:57:17,710
- Ain't that the fella
that lifted up the bell

1970
01:57:17,710 --> 01:57:19,090
on confirmation day?

1971
01:57:19,090 --> 01:57:20,530
What's he want with you?

1972
01:57:20,530 --> 01:57:21,490
- Oh, it ain't him wantin' with me,

1973
01:57:21,490 --> 01:57:22,700
I just hired him on.

1974
01:57:22,700 --> 01:57:24,380
- Well you just fire him then.

1975
01:57:24,380 --> 01:57:25,910
- Are you tellin' me how
to run this farm, Kate?

1976
01:57:25,910 --> 01:57:27,270
- I don't want him around.

1977
01:57:27,270 --> 01:57:28,880
You get rid of him!

1978
01:57:28,880 --> 01:57:30,740
- I have to have a hand.

1979
01:57:30,740 --> 01:57:33,060
- You want a hand, you
go bring my son home!

1980
01:57:34,120 --> 01:57:36,390
I want Hocking here, where he belongs!

1981
01:57:40,048 --> 01:57:42,715
(pigs grunting)

1982
01:57:50,840 --> 01:57:52,790
- What's all that good butter
doin' in the hog slops?

1983
01:57:52,790 --> 01:57:54,790
There's gotta be at least 50 pounds.

1984
01:57:56,140 --> 01:57:58,080
- A chicken feather fell in the batch.

1985
01:57:58,080 --> 01:57:59,080
- A chicken feather?

1986
01:58:00,050 --> 01:58:01,730
One chicken feather?

1987
01:58:01,730 --> 01:58:04,180
You throw out nearly
$15 worth of good butter

1988
01:58:04,180 --> 01:58:06,030
because of a chicken feather?

1989
01:58:06,030 --> 01:58:08,150
- You think I'm gonna let
one of those rich town women

1990
01:58:08,150 --> 01:58:11,100
up on Main Street Hill find a
chicken feather in my butter?

1991
01:58:12,143 --> 01:58:13,480
I've got a reputation to think of.

1992
01:58:13,480 --> 01:58:14,800
- Oh, hell, Kate.

1993
01:58:14,800 --> 01:58:17,120
You're doin' this on purpose
just to get back at me.

1994
01:58:17,120 --> 01:58:18,750
- You wanna get paid from the butter?

1995
01:58:18,750 --> 01:58:19,710
Get it from Grover.

1996
01:58:21,540 --> 01:58:22,780
He's the one who's been stirrin' it

1997
01:58:22,780 --> 01:58:24,470
since you sent Hocking away.

1998
01:58:24,470 --> 01:58:25,710
Hocking never let a chicken feather-

1999
01:58:25,710 --> 01:58:28,130
- I said never to mention
his name in this house again!

2000
01:58:28,130 --> 01:58:31,973
- I won't be told I can't
say my own son's name!

2001
01:58:36,130 --> 01:58:41,130
(cow mooing)
(slow soft music)

2002
01:58:46,042 --> 01:58:48,792
(birds chirping)

2003
01:58:50,570 --> 01:58:52,874
- What do you wanna be a hand for?

2004
01:58:52,874 --> 01:58:54,800
My father's gonna be real strict with you.

2005
01:58:54,800 --> 01:58:55,633
- So I heard.

2006
01:58:56,560 --> 01:58:58,600
Your mother don't want
me here neither, but,

2007
01:58:59,770 --> 01:59:00,970
I don't care about that.

2008
01:59:02,020 --> 01:59:04,342
I come here so you can get to know me.

2009
01:59:04,342 --> 01:59:07,430
- (laughs) Why should I
care to get to know you?

2010
01:59:07,430 --> 01:59:09,830
- I ain't forgot you since
the day at the church.

2011
01:59:10,700 --> 01:59:12,700
I'd have moved on long ago but for that.

2012
01:59:13,904 --> 01:59:16,737
(slow soft music)

2013
01:59:19,728 --> 01:59:22,478
(birds chirping)

2014
01:59:30,897 --> 01:59:33,647
(men chattering)

2015
01:59:42,449 --> 01:59:46,449
(dishes clanking and clamoring)

2016
01:59:57,570 --> 01:59:58,990
- Were you raised in a barn?

2017
01:59:58,990 --> 02:00:00,470
Can't you wipe your plate with your bread

2018
02:00:00,470 --> 02:00:02,990
instead of bringin' your
slops back to me to clean?

2019
02:00:04,090 --> 02:00:06,060
- I'll do that in the
future, Miss Linthorne.

2020
02:00:12,054 --> 02:00:14,471
(Kate sighs)

2021
02:00:15,990 --> 02:00:17,330
- Why are you carrying on like this?

2022
02:00:17,330 --> 02:00:18,930
It's not fittin'.

2023
02:00:18,930 --> 02:00:21,020
- He eats Hock's food.

2024
02:00:21,020 --> 02:00:22,240
He sleeps in his bed.

2025
02:00:23,170 --> 02:00:25,460
I can't stand havin' him in my house.

2026
02:00:25,460 --> 02:00:26,470
- He's a good hand.

2027
02:00:27,610 --> 02:00:29,380
- As good as your son?

2028
02:00:29,380 --> 02:00:32,030
- I have to do what I think is right.

2029
02:00:32,030 --> 02:00:33,070
- So does a mule.

2030
02:00:34,490 --> 02:00:36,950
- [Jim] Don't tell me what to do!

2031
02:00:36,950 --> 02:00:38,170
Or when to drink!

2032
02:00:38,170 --> 02:00:39,003
I tell you!

2033
02:00:40,744 --> 02:00:42,294
I'll drink when I feel like it!

2034
02:00:43,914 --> 02:00:47,009
And you, get out of my face!
(slaps Judith)

2035
02:00:47,009 --> 02:00:48,860
- [Lucille] Jim, you stop that!

2036
02:00:48,860 --> 02:00:50,430
- [Jim] Why don't you
get back in the kitchen

2037
02:00:50,430 --> 02:00:52,273
like where you belong!

2038
02:00:52,273 --> 02:00:54,624
Go on, go on with you!
(Judith crying)

2039
02:00:54,624 --> 02:00:57,272
(slow somber music)

2040
02:00:57,272 --> 02:00:58,590
Stay there!

2041
02:00:58,590 --> 02:01:03,590
I'll tell you when I'm ready!

2042
02:01:05,601 --> 02:01:07,850
- [Thomas] I saw something
troublin' today, Spence.

2043
02:01:08,690 --> 02:01:09,523
- [Spence] Mm hm?

2044
02:01:11,730 --> 02:01:13,630
- Jim Brewster's drinkin' heavy again.

2045
02:01:18,160 --> 02:01:18,993
- It's a shame.

2046
02:01:20,630 --> 02:01:23,990
- Shame is how he treats that girl of his.

2047
02:01:26,510 --> 02:01:27,630
- She growin' up fast.

2048
02:01:29,218 --> 02:01:32,770
(people chattering)

2049
02:01:32,770 --> 02:01:33,970
- Spit it out, Spence.

2050
02:01:38,640 --> 02:01:43,640
- Man raisin' a girl that
age, don't feel no kin to her.

2051
02:01:45,580 --> 02:01:46,740
Man drinkin' every day,

2052
02:01:46,740 --> 02:01:48,860
there's no tellin' what might happen.

2053
02:01:56,184 --> 02:01:59,351
(slow dramatic music)

2054
02:02:16,049 --> 02:02:18,799
(horse whinnies)

2055
02:02:34,671 --> 02:02:37,504
(hooves clopping)

2056
02:02:38,462 --> 02:02:41,212
(horse whinnies)

2057
02:02:44,564 --> 02:02:46,350
- [Jed] Here, give me your hand.

2058
02:02:46,350 --> 02:02:47,350
- Thank you.

2059
02:02:49,837 --> 02:02:52,587
(horse whinnies)

2060
02:02:54,511 --> 02:02:57,428
(knocking on door)

2061
02:03:00,860 --> 02:03:03,206
I know you wouldn't take charity, Hock,

2062
02:03:03,206 --> 02:03:05,330
but we're worried to death about you.

2063
02:03:05,330 --> 02:03:07,660
We know how Orly treats his sharecroppers.

2064
02:03:07,660 --> 02:03:10,165
- Take 'em home, Char, we don't want 'em.

2065
02:03:10,165 --> 02:03:12,050
- You're just as stubborn as Pa is.

2066
02:03:12,050 --> 02:03:13,760
- Bless you, Miss Linthorne.

2067
02:03:13,760 --> 02:03:16,290
I swear the baby's
dyin' of cold inside me.

2068
02:03:16,290 --> 02:03:17,240
- Get inside, Elva.

2069
02:03:18,360 --> 02:03:20,170
- Won't you talk to your father for us?

2070
02:03:20,170 --> 02:03:21,790
Let us come home?

2071
02:03:21,790 --> 02:03:22,780
- Elva, get inside!

2072
02:03:25,400 --> 02:03:27,460
You don't tell him
nothin', Char, you hear?

2073
02:03:27,460 --> 02:03:28,293
- Hock!

2074
02:03:30,673 --> 02:03:33,506
(slow soft music)

2075
02:03:40,560 --> 02:03:41,643
No, Jed, I...

2076
02:03:42,527 --> 02:03:43,520
- Don't you want to?

2077
02:03:43,520 --> 02:03:44,960
- Of course I want to.

2078
02:03:46,564 --> 02:03:47,397
I love you.

2079
02:03:48,360 --> 02:03:51,158
But I won't, not until we're married.

2080
02:03:51,158 --> 02:03:53,350
- (sighs) Your mama won't
ever let you marry me.

2081
02:03:54,770 --> 02:03:57,512
- Didn't stop Hock when Pa said it.

2082
02:03:57,512 --> 02:03:59,845
(Jed sighs)

2083
02:04:01,662 --> 02:04:03,493
(Kate clears throats)

2084
02:04:03,493 --> 02:04:06,360
(Charlotte giggles)

2085
02:04:06,360 --> 02:04:07,800
- Okay, ready now?

2086
02:04:07,800 --> 02:04:09,457
- Charlotte?
- One,

2087
02:04:09,457 --> 02:04:10,420
two, three.
- Hello, Charlotte?

2088
02:04:12,188 --> 02:04:13,720
(Kate sighs)

2089
02:04:13,720 --> 02:04:14,600
- [Ralph] Charlotte!

2090
02:04:16,470 --> 02:04:18,020
- It's Ralph.

2091
02:04:18,020 --> 02:04:18,853
- [Kate] Oh.

2092
02:04:20,170 --> 02:04:21,970
- Excuse me.

2093
02:04:25,083 --> 02:04:26,220
- I'll ask him to leave.

2094
02:04:28,525 --> 02:04:30,858
(puffs air)

2095
02:04:33,560 --> 02:04:35,270
- I got something for you, Charlotte.

2096
02:04:37,009 --> 02:04:38,410
- Got somethin' for me?

2097
02:04:38,410 --> 02:04:39,700
I don't know why.

2098
02:04:39,700 --> 02:04:41,520
- It's your birthday, ain't it?

2099
02:04:41,520 --> 02:04:44,860
- I'm sorry, I can't accept
a present from you, Ralph.

2100
02:04:44,860 --> 02:04:46,930
- Guess I ain't good enough?

2101
02:04:46,930 --> 02:04:47,950
- I didn't say that.

2102
02:04:48,820 --> 02:04:50,490
- I know what you said, Charlotte.

2103
02:04:50,490 --> 02:04:52,040
Only it strikes me as pretty funny.

2104
02:04:52,040 --> 02:04:55,000
You think a hired man's
plenty good enough.

2105
02:04:55,000 --> 02:04:56,400
- You don't say that to her.

2106
02:04:57,440 --> 02:04:58,890
You say things like to me.

2107
02:05:00,050 --> 02:05:01,000
- All right.
- No!

2108
02:05:07,345 --> 02:05:12,345
(horse whinnies)
(slow dramatic music)

2109
02:05:21,170 --> 02:05:23,600
- It's either him or me, Thomas.

2110
02:05:23,600 --> 02:05:24,600
He don't go, I will.

2111
02:05:25,450 --> 02:05:28,380
And I won't turn my hand to
a lick of work until he does.

2112
02:05:28,380 --> 02:05:29,820
- [Thomas] Kate, Kate!

2113
02:05:31,064 --> 02:05:33,540
- [Charlotte] Let me go.

2114
02:05:35,854 --> 02:05:38,771
(knocking on door)

2115
02:05:42,580 --> 02:05:43,430
I love him, mama.

2116
02:05:44,460 --> 02:05:45,900
- You dare say that to me!

2117
02:05:47,010 --> 02:05:48,550
This,

2118
02:05:48,550 --> 02:05:53,270
this, this drifter has
taken your brother's place.

2119
02:05:53,270 --> 02:05:56,250
- It's not about Hock, it's about me.

2120
02:05:56,250 --> 02:05:59,290
Me, mama.
(slow soft music)

2121
02:05:59,290 --> 02:06:01,081
He's the man I wanna marry.

2122
02:06:01,081 --> 02:06:04,748
(Kate groaning and gasping)

2123
02:06:07,578 --> 02:06:09,230
- I forbid it.

2124
02:06:09,230 --> 02:06:10,870
I want him out of here.

2125
02:06:10,870 --> 02:06:12,270
Tonight!

2126
02:06:12,270 --> 02:06:14,715
- You sound just like Papa.

2127
02:06:14,715 --> 02:06:17,882
(slow dramatic music)

2128
02:06:32,498 --> 02:06:36,498
- I just assume lose a
jaw tooth as have you go.

2129
02:06:37,810 --> 02:06:38,643
Thank you, Jed.

2130
02:06:46,040 --> 02:06:47,690
Over here.

2131
02:06:47,690 --> 02:06:50,400
Like that, now, push it.

2132
02:06:50,400 --> 02:06:52,430
Wait. (groaning)

2133
02:06:58,650 --> 02:06:59,483
You all right?

2134
02:07:00,845 --> 02:07:02,178
- [Grover] Yeah.

2135
02:07:04,930 --> 02:07:07,350
- Good thing you're goin'
to college to be a lawyer.

2136
02:07:09,790 --> 02:07:12,120
Why don't you go on up to
the house, help your mother.

2137
02:07:13,150 --> 02:07:15,388
(horse whinnies)

2138
02:07:15,388 --> 02:07:18,555
(slow dramatic music)

2139
02:07:25,259 --> 02:07:28,009
(horse whinnies)

2140
02:07:35,857 --> 02:07:38,524
(Thomas groans)

2141
02:07:42,029 --> 02:07:44,612
(Thomas sighs)

2142
02:07:48,040 --> 02:07:51,520
I work all my life to make
a place for my family,

2143
02:07:51,520 --> 02:07:53,190
and there I am in my fields,

2144
02:07:54,460 --> 02:07:55,380
all by myself.

2145
02:07:57,300 --> 02:07:59,580
- And who do you blame for that?

2146
02:07:59,580 --> 02:08:02,180
- Don't seem to be any
rhyme or reason at all

2147
02:08:02,180 --> 02:08:03,380
the way things turn out.

2148
02:08:07,030 --> 02:08:07,980
- Charlotte's gone.

2149
02:08:10,160 --> 02:08:10,993
- [Thomas] Gone?

2150
02:08:11,840 --> 02:08:12,990
- She ran off with him.

2151
02:08:17,827 --> 02:08:21,250
(birds chirping)

2152
02:08:21,250 --> 02:08:24,640
- Well, we did the same
thing ourselves, Kate.

2153
02:08:26,226 --> 02:08:27,370
It turned out all right.

2154
02:08:30,240 --> 02:08:31,680
- You think he'll be good to her?

2155
02:08:31,680 --> 02:08:34,690
- Oh, I know he will.

2156
02:08:40,242 --> 02:08:45,242
(lighthearted music)
(people chattering)

2157
02:08:51,400 --> 02:08:53,778
- [Man] Push it up!

2158
02:08:53,778 --> 02:08:55,178
- The Reverend Dr. Garshman.

2159
02:08:56,040 --> 02:08:58,360
Wonder what he's bringin'
that circus here for?

2160
02:08:58,360 --> 02:09:00,460
- He has the biggest tent revival in Ohio.

2161
02:09:01,560 --> 02:09:03,210
Folks say he has genuine calling.

2162
02:09:04,936 --> 02:09:07,610
(sighs) And there are those hereabouts

2163
02:09:07,610 --> 02:09:10,020
could stand havin' their hearts opened up.

2164
02:09:11,087 --> 02:09:11,970
- The world is full of people

2165
02:09:11,970 --> 02:09:13,440
who try to make a man live their lives

2166
02:09:13,440 --> 02:09:14,770
according to their own beliefs,

2167
02:09:14,770 --> 02:09:18,280
and yelp, "He's bound for
the hot place," if he don't.

2168
02:09:18,280 --> 02:09:21,850
Well, I figure I can make
my way without their help.

2169
02:09:26,473 --> 02:09:29,217
(slow soft music)

2170
02:09:29,217 --> 02:09:31,400
(sighs)

2171
02:09:31,400 --> 02:09:34,990
- Says they found a little place
over the river in Kentucky.

2172
02:09:34,990 --> 02:09:37,590
Close enough to come visit for
Christmas if we'll have 'em.

2173
02:09:38,580 --> 02:09:40,630
I wanna write and tell her to come.

2174
02:09:40,630 --> 02:09:41,960
- They're welcome here any time.

2175
02:09:41,960 --> 02:09:42,910
Put that in for me.

2176
02:09:44,037 --> 02:09:46,400
(slow soft music)

2177
02:09:46,400 --> 02:09:48,470
(sighs)

2178
02:09:48,470 --> 02:09:49,570
- Couldn't we go over?

2179
02:09:52,670 --> 02:09:54,810
Just for a little while?

2180
02:09:54,810 --> 02:09:57,160
- Oh, there won't be
no place to sit by now.

2181
02:09:57,160 --> 02:09:58,470
- I don't mind standing.

2182
02:10:03,077 --> 02:10:07,110
- Oh, hell.

2183
02:10:07,110 --> 02:10:08,620
- Who is going to be saved?

2184
02:10:09,630 --> 02:10:11,982
Who is going to be saved tonight?

2185
02:10:11,982 --> 02:10:13,846
(people shouting)

2186
02:10:13,846 --> 02:10:14,679
- 'Cause I'm a sinner.

2187
02:10:14,679 --> 02:10:16,110
I'm a sinner.
- Yes!

2188
02:10:16,110 --> 02:10:18,030
Lord, Lord I hear you sister.

2189
02:10:18,938 --> 02:10:20,220
(Celia crying out)
All right!

2190
02:10:21,639 --> 02:10:22,589
That's what I love.

2191
02:10:24,437 --> 02:10:26,450
Oh, yes, my sister, I feel it!

2192
02:10:26,450 --> 02:10:27,283
I feel it!

2193
02:10:27,283 --> 02:10:28,890
Yes!

2194
02:10:28,890 --> 02:10:29,990
What do we have here?

2195
02:10:30,890 --> 02:10:34,150
We have here another
sinner caught for the Lamb!

2196
02:10:35,760 --> 02:10:36,760
Yes!

2197
02:10:37,630 --> 02:10:40,110
Sit right down in the mercy seat, sister.

2198
02:10:40,110 --> 02:10:41,670
Y'all take care of her now.

2199
02:10:41,670 --> 02:10:42,740
Take care of her.

2200
02:10:42,740 --> 02:10:46,219
At last, at last, you'll
meet Jesus at last!

2201
02:10:46,219 --> 02:10:48,560
(people shouting)

2202
02:10:48,560 --> 02:10:50,570
Now what do I hear?

2203
02:10:50,570 --> 02:10:52,070
I hear another.

2204
02:10:52,070 --> 02:10:54,486
Yes, Lord, I hear another!

2205
02:10:54,486 --> 02:10:56,240
(people shouting)

2206
02:10:56,240 --> 02:10:57,470
- Hallelujah!
- And this time,

2207
02:10:57,470 --> 02:10:59,030
could it possibly be

2208
02:11:00,930 --> 02:11:01,763
a brother?

2209
02:11:03,180 --> 02:11:06,400
Why don't you come up here
and be saved, brother?

2210
02:11:08,402 --> 02:11:10,780
- If there's one soul in
this tent don't need savin',

2211
02:11:10,780 --> 02:11:12,240
it's Spence Vitt's.

2212
02:11:12,240 --> 02:11:14,400
- Joy in your bones!

2213
02:11:15,530 --> 02:11:17,200
Praise his holy name, brother!

2214
02:11:18,120 --> 02:11:21,300
Praise his holy name!

2215
02:11:21,300 --> 02:11:22,750
- Lead me to him, brother!

2216
02:11:22,750 --> 02:11:25,530
- I will lead you to him, brother.

2217
02:11:25,530 --> 02:11:28,470
I will lead you to the light.

2218
02:11:28,470 --> 02:11:31,190
You will feel his power!

2219
02:11:31,190 --> 02:11:33,130
And you will feel his might!

2220
02:11:34,642 --> 02:11:36,826
(crowd shouting)

2221
02:11:36,826 --> 02:11:37,659
Tonight!

2222
02:11:38,842 --> 02:11:40,171
Yes!

2223
02:11:40,171 --> 02:11:42,691
Everybody say amen!
- Amen!

2224
02:11:42,691 --> 02:11:45,685
- Say it again, amen!
- Amen!

2225
02:11:45,685 --> 02:11:48,380
- Yes!
- I'll be damned.

2226
02:11:48,380 --> 02:11:49,320
- Hush, Thomas.

2227
02:11:49,320 --> 02:11:50,940
Remember where you are.

2228
02:11:50,940 --> 02:11:53,120
- That verse of mine,

2229
02:11:53,120 --> 02:11:57,570
"Confessing Christ as Lord."

2230
02:11:57,570 --> 02:11:59,400
- Hallelujah!
- Amen!

2231
02:11:59,400 --> 02:12:04,120
- We are saved by grace divine.

2232
02:12:04,120 --> 02:12:06,180
- Praise the Lord.
- Praise the Lord.

2233
02:12:07,390 --> 02:12:09,280
- Had enough?
- Grace divine.

2234
02:12:09,280 --> 02:12:10,906
- Not yet.

2235
02:12:10,906 --> 02:12:12,820
- [Man] She's standing up now.

2236
02:12:12,820 --> 02:12:14,280
- Right this way, sister.

2237
02:12:14,280 --> 02:12:16,700
And take your place on the mercy seat.

2238
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:18,833
Yes!

2239
02:12:20,212 --> 02:12:21,550
Down on your knees!

2240
02:12:25,590 --> 02:12:28,050
All is forgiven.

2241
02:12:28,050 --> 02:12:28,883
- Is that right?

2242
02:12:30,140 --> 02:12:31,150
Listen, everybody!

2243
02:12:34,761 --> 02:12:36,990
I guess you all know me.
(thunder rumbling)

2244
02:12:36,990 --> 02:12:38,020
Most of you anyway.

2245
02:12:39,580 --> 02:12:40,730
I'm Jim Brewster!

2246
02:12:42,330 --> 02:12:44,750
Lonzo Brewster's no account son!

2247
02:12:46,920 --> 02:12:48,730
I just came over here to say,

2248
02:12:50,070 --> 02:12:52,520
to say-
- Praise the Lord!

2249
02:12:52,520 --> 02:12:55,110
Come right down front, brother!

2250
02:12:55,110 --> 02:12:57,120
God is waiting for you!

2251
02:12:57,120 --> 02:13:01,610
- God ain't waitin' for me!
(thunder rumbles)

2252
02:13:03,370 --> 02:13:06,220
I just come over here to tell all of ya,

2253
02:13:07,990 --> 02:13:12,990
to tell ya that Tom
Linthorne here stole my wife!

2254
02:13:15,730 --> 02:13:16,620
You ask him!

2255
02:13:20,483 --> 02:13:21,316
He stole my, my wife.

2256
02:13:24,433 --> 02:13:26,690
And what's more, he's pappy to my Judith!

2257
02:13:26,690 --> 02:13:28,870
Only she ain't mine, she's his.

2258
02:13:31,329 --> 02:13:34,810
And he's her pappy.
(thunder rumbles)

2259
02:13:34,810 --> 02:13:35,643
You ask him!

2260
02:13:38,553 --> 02:13:43,553
(slow dramatic music)
(Thomas gasping)

2261
02:13:43,691 --> 02:13:45,691
- [Reverend] Sweet people!

2262
02:13:45,691 --> 02:13:47,710
This is not the time to run

2263
02:13:47,710 --> 02:13:50,090
from our Lord and Savior!

2264
02:13:51,020 --> 02:13:53,490
We're all sinners here!

2265
02:13:53,490 --> 02:13:56,620
And all will be forgiven

2266
02:13:56,620 --> 02:13:59,923
when you give of yourself to Jesus.

2267
02:14:01,171 --> 02:14:06,171
(crowd shouting)
(slow dramatic music)

2268
02:14:06,868 --> 02:14:09,785
(thunder rumbling)

2269
02:14:23,744 --> 02:14:26,494
(Thomas panting)

2270
02:14:29,137 --> 02:14:30,630
- (sighs) What's done is done.

2271
02:14:32,210 --> 02:14:35,100
No sense like you acting
like a whipped dog.

2272
02:14:35,100 --> 02:14:37,100
Either of us.

2273
02:14:40,690 --> 02:14:41,640
What are you doing?

2274
02:14:43,672 --> 02:14:45,822
- I have to go over there?
- Oh, what for?

2275
02:14:47,110 --> 02:14:48,980
So one of you can die over this?

2276
02:14:50,120 --> 02:14:51,900
It could be you this time.

2277
02:14:51,900 --> 02:14:53,620
- I'm going to bring her here, Kate.

2278
02:14:57,719 --> 02:14:59,640
He isn't going to have my daughter

2279
02:14:59,640 --> 02:15:01,230
under his roof one more day.

2280
02:15:02,797 --> 02:15:05,964
(slow dramatic music)

2281
02:15:12,531 --> 02:15:14,825
(door closes)

2282
02:15:14,825 --> 02:15:19,825
(thunder rumbles)
(rain spattering)

2283
02:15:34,933 --> 02:15:38,016
(barn door thudding)

2284
02:16:01,981 --> 02:16:02,814
Judith!

2285
02:16:04,693 --> 02:16:08,026
Judy!
(thunder rumbling)

2286
02:16:12,787 --> 02:16:14,870
- [Judith] Mr. Linthorne.

2287
02:16:17,296 --> 02:16:18,879
- Oh, Judith, girl.

2288
02:16:24,016 --> 02:16:27,599
Don't be afraid. (panting)

2289
02:16:34,795 --> 02:16:38,909
You don't have to be afraid
of anything ever again.

2290
02:16:38,909 --> 02:16:41,840
(slow dramatic music)

2291
02:16:41,840 --> 02:16:42,840
- Are you my father?

2292
02:16:45,360 --> 02:16:46,193
- Yes.

2293
02:16:51,020 --> 02:16:54,281
(Judith weeping)
Yes, sir.

2294
02:16:54,281 --> 02:16:57,114
(slow soft music)

2295
02:17:03,129 --> 02:17:04,629
Where's your mama?

2296
02:17:05,580 --> 02:17:08,370
- They had the worst fight they ever had.

2297
02:17:08,370 --> 02:17:11,680
She run off and he came looking for me

2298
02:17:11,680 --> 02:17:14,580
but I was hid in the woods and
then he went into the barn.

2299
02:17:15,899 --> 02:17:18,290
(Judith weeping)

2300
02:17:18,290 --> 02:17:19,540
- Did you go in the barn?

2301
02:17:21,092 --> 02:17:23,963
Oh, I'm sorry.

2302
02:17:23,963 --> 02:17:25,160
I'm sorry.

2303
02:17:26,497 --> 02:17:28,527
I'm sorry.

2304
02:17:28,527 --> 02:17:33,527
(fire crackling)
(slow soft music)

2305
02:17:38,859 --> 02:17:43,859
(door opens)
(thunder rumbles)

2306
02:17:47,008 --> 02:17:49,925
(Judith shivering)

2307
02:18:10,299 --> 02:18:12,296
- Come sit down.

2308
02:18:12,296 --> 02:18:15,129
(slow soft music)

2309
02:18:22,100 --> 02:18:23,880
I don't think you should work today.

2310
02:18:25,120 --> 02:18:27,900
I think you should go down
and fetch Hocking back home.

2311
02:18:34,544 --> 02:18:35,670
(sighs)

2312
02:18:35,670 --> 02:18:37,070
I know you love her, Thomas.

2313
02:18:38,460 --> 02:18:40,560
Guess it's been damned up all these years.

2314
02:18:42,740 --> 02:18:45,130
You want me to be mother to
your child by another woman,

2315
02:18:45,130 --> 02:18:45,963
I will.

2316
02:18:47,600 --> 02:18:49,250
But I want my child back.

2317
02:18:51,143 --> 02:18:54,544
You can't ask me the one
and not give me the other.

2318
02:18:54,544 --> 02:18:57,792
(slow dramatic music)

2319
02:18:57,792 --> 02:19:01,025
(crickets chirping)

2320
02:19:01,025 --> 02:19:03,525
(bird cawing)

2321
02:19:07,103 --> 02:19:10,206
- Hock!

2322
02:19:10,206 --> 02:19:11,039
Hock!

2323
02:19:15,335 --> 02:19:16,910
How you makin' out here?

2324
02:19:16,910 --> 02:19:18,490
- I guess we're doin' all right.

2325
02:19:20,488 --> 02:19:25,324
(slow somber music)
(bird cawing)

2326
02:19:25,324 --> 02:19:28,324
(crickets chirping)

2327
02:19:31,064 --> 02:19:32,380
- You don't want your children born here,

2328
02:19:32,380 --> 02:19:33,840
raised here, do ya?

2329
02:19:33,840 --> 02:19:35,420
- I plan on makin' it better.

2330
02:19:35,420 --> 02:19:36,570
- Come on home, Hock.

2331
02:19:38,310 --> 02:19:40,000
Your mama's askin' for ya.

2332
02:19:41,290 --> 02:19:42,610
- No sense pullin' up now.

2333
02:19:42,610 --> 02:19:44,250
We're doin' all right.

2334
02:19:44,250 --> 02:19:45,680
- Don't be so hard with me.

2335
02:19:47,060 --> 02:19:49,520
I shouldn't have done what I did.

2336
02:19:49,520 --> 02:19:52,320
You want, I'll come on in
and tell Elva the same thing.

2337
02:19:53,411 --> 02:19:54,470
- You tell mama we're doin' just fine.

2338
02:19:54,470 --> 02:19:55,770
She got no cause to worry.

2339
02:19:57,406 --> 02:20:00,406
(crickets chirping)

2340
02:20:03,622 --> 02:20:05,948
(water sloshing)

2341
02:20:05,948 --> 02:20:08,615
(pigs grunting)

2342
02:20:17,189 --> 02:20:19,189
(sighs)

2343
02:20:21,930 --> 02:20:23,520
- Stubborn as a mule, that one.

2344
02:20:24,650 --> 02:20:25,880
Just like his father.

2345
02:20:27,650 --> 02:20:30,317
(pigs grunting)

2346
02:20:32,970 --> 02:20:34,810
- [Man] Columbus Lutheran University.

2347
02:20:34,810 --> 02:20:35,643
Fall out.

2348
02:20:37,435 --> 02:20:42,435
(slow dramatic music)
(people chattering)

2349
02:20:58,270 --> 02:21:03,270
- 26, this is it.

2350
02:21:13,902 --> 02:21:15,235
- [Thomas] Well.

2351
02:21:18,250 --> 02:21:19,450
- You better get goin', Pop.

2352
02:21:19,450 --> 02:21:21,100
You're gonna miss the train back.

2353
02:21:22,330 --> 02:21:23,880
- There's $25 there.

2354
02:21:26,069 --> 02:21:28,450
Of course you can write for
more if that gets all used up,

2355
02:21:28,450 --> 02:21:31,430
but that oughta do till
Thanksgivin', the way I figure it.

2356
02:21:35,470 --> 02:21:36,570
You be a good boy now.

2357
02:21:37,920 --> 02:21:39,850
You say your prayers and
read your Bible at night,

2358
02:21:39,850 --> 02:21:40,950
same as we do at home.

2359
02:21:41,870 --> 02:21:42,820
- Yes, sir, I will.

2360
02:21:47,410 --> 02:21:50,210
- You be true to your
name, that's all I ask.

2361
02:21:54,050 --> 02:21:54,883
- Yes, sir.

2362
02:21:56,047 --> 02:21:58,797
(apple crunches)

2363
02:22:06,340 --> 02:22:08,280
- You know I love you, don't you?

2364
02:22:08,280 --> 02:22:09,190
- Yeah, sure, Pop.

2365
02:22:16,730 --> 02:22:21,309
(train bell dinging)
(train engine puffing)

2366
02:22:21,309 --> 02:22:24,642
(train whistle blowing)

2367
02:22:45,034 --> 02:22:47,201
- [Thomas] There's my boy!

2368
02:22:48,469 --> 02:22:49,858
- [Man] Just a minute,
son, I'll get your bags.

2369
02:22:49,858 --> 02:22:51,806
- Let me look at ya.

2370
02:22:51,806 --> 02:22:53,206
- [Man] One moment now there, ladies.

2371
02:22:53,206 --> 02:22:54,500
- What you got in all them things?

2372
02:22:54,500 --> 02:22:56,230
- [Grover] It's Christmas, Pop.

2373
02:22:56,230 --> 02:22:58,800
- I thought you were pretty well strapped?

2374
02:22:58,800 --> 02:23:01,550
- I just got a few things
for mother and Charlotte

2375
02:23:01,550 --> 02:23:02,720
and Judith, here.

2376
02:23:02,720 --> 02:23:03,710
- [Thomas] And Hock?

2377
02:23:05,670 --> 02:23:06,880
- Well did you get him a present?

2378
02:23:06,880 --> 02:23:08,740
- Oh, he won't take anything from me.

2379
02:23:11,020 --> 02:23:12,400
- I can't see gettin' him a present

2380
02:23:12,400 --> 02:23:15,282
if he won't even come home for Christmas.

2381
02:23:15,282 --> 02:23:17,932
(people chattering)

2382
02:23:17,932 --> 02:23:20,610
I stood first in Latin Composition.

2383
02:23:20,610 --> 02:23:22,010
Joined the Debating Society.

2384
02:23:24,173 --> 02:23:25,200
I have to work on my elocution

2385
02:23:25,200 --> 02:23:27,910
if I'm gonna get elected
sophomore president next year.

2386
02:23:27,910 --> 02:23:31,130
- Sounds like college
life agrees with you, son.

2387
02:23:31,130 --> 02:23:32,310
- Yeah.

2388
02:23:32,310 --> 02:23:33,450
It's cat's whiskers, Pop.

2389
02:23:33,450 --> 02:23:36,120
- I want you to tell me all about it.

2390
02:23:36,120 --> 02:23:38,092
- Well, I can't tell you everything.

2391
02:23:38,092 --> 02:23:40,347
- Oh. (laughs)

2392
02:23:40,347 --> 02:23:43,180
(family laughing)

2393
02:23:44,370 --> 02:23:46,120
You're not eating, Kate.

2394
02:23:46,120 --> 02:23:47,765
Don't you like your own cookin'?

2395
02:23:47,765 --> 02:23:49,460
- (sighs) Grown too sacked tonight.

2396
02:23:49,460 --> 02:23:50,810
I got no appetite.

2397
02:23:50,810 --> 02:23:52,520
- Best Christmas dinner I ever ate, Ma.

2398
02:23:52,520 --> 02:23:53,520
- It was wonderful.

2399
02:23:54,660 --> 02:23:57,120
- Mm, looks like we got plenty
of everything left over.

2400
02:23:57,120 --> 02:23:59,710
- Enough for Christmas
dinner at Hock's place, too.

2401
02:23:59,710 --> 02:24:02,480
Think he'd like a good Christmas
dinner with a new baby.

2402
02:24:03,320 --> 02:24:04,590
- Oh, I guess it's not surprising

2403
02:24:04,590 --> 02:24:06,490
how much you got left over.

2404
02:24:06,490 --> 02:24:08,150
Considering how much you made.

2405
02:24:09,431 --> 02:24:10,264
(Kate laughs)

2406
02:24:10,264 --> 02:24:11,920
- I can ride it over to them.

2407
02:24:11,920 --> 02:24:13,520
- Would you, Jed?
- Yes, Ma'am.

2408
02:24:14,430 --> 02:24:15,263
- You tell him,

2409
02:24:19,610 --> 02:24:21,060
you tell him merry Christmas.

2410
02:24:25,253 --> 02:24:27,941
♪ Oh come let us adore Him ♪

2411
02:24:27,941 --> 02:24:30,782
♪ Oh come let us adore Him ♪

2412
02:24:30,782 --> 02:24:34,437
♪ Oh come let us adore Him ♪

2413
02:24:34,437 --> 02:24:38,047
♪ Christ, the Lord ♪

2414
02:24:38,047 --> 02:24:39,512
(Charlotte laughs)

2415
02:24:39,512 --> 02:24:40,345
- Hey, that was great.

2416
02:24:42,180 --> 02:24:44,650
- Elva was right grateful
and sends her thanks.

2417
02:24:44,650 --> 02:24:45,483
- And Hocking?

2418
02:24:47,530 --> 02:24:49,190
- Hocking didn't come to the door.

2419
02:24:50,463 --> 02:24:53,470
(fire crackling)

2420
02:24:53,470 --> 02:24:54,590
- [Grover] How you doin', girl?

2421
02:24:55,460 --> 02:24:56,640
It's old Grove.

2422
02:24:56,640 --> 02:24:58,850
Yeah, it's old Grove.

2423
02:24:58,850 --> 02:25:00,500
- Fine lookin' animal, ain't she?

2424
02:25:02,320 --> 02:25:04,170
Best blood lines in the county.

2425
02:25:04,170 --> 02:25:05,390
- Yeah, she's beautiful.

2426
02:25:06,630 --> 02:25:08,400
- Something eatin' at you, Grover?

2427
02:25:09,280 --> 02:25:10,880
You didn't say a word at dinner.

2428
02:25:11,751 --> 02:25:15,080
(grain spilling)

2429
02:25:15,080 --> 02:25:16,740
Spit it out.
- Pop.

2430
02:25:19,950 --> 02:25:23,620
I owe a fella some money.
(horse whinnies)

2431
02:25:23,620 --> 02:25:25,590
He says he gotta have it.

2432
02:25:25,590 --> 02:25:27,250
- Well what did you do with his money?

2433
02:25:27,250 --> 02:25:29,030
- Nothin', I didn't do anything with it,

2434
02:25:29,030 --> 02:25:30,130
I just have to pay it.

2435
02:25:31,040 --> 02:25:32,870
- Then what do you owe the money for?

2436
02:25:34,222 --> 02:25:36,805
(wind blowing)

2437
02:25:38,180 --> 02:25:39,013
Hm?

2438
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:43,000
Best thing you can do to help
yourself is tell me the truth.

2439
02:25:47,620 --> 02:25:52,620
- Ralph and Eugene, they
showed up at school last week

2440
02:25:54,660 --> 02:25:57,650
and we played some cards, and I lost money

2441
02:25:57,650 --> 02:25:58,600
that I didn't have.

2442
02:25:59,870 --> 02:26:01,170
- How much money?

2443
02:26:01,170 --> 02:26:02,360
- About $50.

2444
02:26:02,360 --> 02:26:03,830
- $50?

2445
02:26:03,830 --> 02:26:05,580
- They got me drunk, Pop.

2446
02:26:05,580 --> 02:26:06,760
Ralph says if I don't pay it,

2447
02:26:06,760 --> 02:26:07,730
he's gonna report me to school,

2448
02:26:07,730 --> 02:26:10,070
he's gonna get me kicked out for gamblin'.

2449
02:26:10,070 --> 02:26:11,970
- And he has this power over you

2450
02:26:11,970 --> 02:26:13,510
because you were gamblin'!

2451
02:26:13,510 --> 02:26:15,120
Even though you know the rules!

2452
02:26:16,272 --> 02:26:18,070
- (sighs) I'm sorry, Pop!

2453
02:26:19,464 --> 02:26:23,360
(slow dramatic music)

2454
02:26:23,360 --> 02:26:25,170
I made an awful mess of things.

2455
02:26:26,509 --> 02:26:27,559
And I never meant to.

2456
02:26:29,197 --> 02:26:31,330
- Well you just march
down to those Tannershams,

2457
02:26:31,330 --> 02:26:33,370
and you tell that skunk
if he ever asks you

2458
02:26:33,370 --> 02:26:35,770
for a penny again, I'll run
him clean out of this county

2459
02:26:35,770 --> 02:26:37,330
and he knows I mean what I say.

2460
02:26:38,470 --> 02:26:39,370
- I can't do that.

2461
02:26:40,326 --> 02:26:43,493
(slow dramatic music)

2462
02:26:44,730 --> 02:26:45,570
- There's one good thing

2463
02:26:45,570 --> 02:26:48,070
to come out of this situation, Grover.

2464
02:26:48,070 --> 02:26:50,570
You got the opportunity
to make a man of yourself.

2465
02:26:51,770 --> 02:26:53,060
Now you stand up to them.

2466
02:26:54,020 --> 02:26:55,500
You watch them, they'll slink off

2467
02:26:55,500 --> 02:26:57,350
like the thievin' barn rats they are.

2468
02:27:01,760 --> 02:27:05,570
- Some of us aren't as strong as you are.

2469
02:27:05,570 --> 02:27:06,720
- Listen to me, Grover!

2470
02:27:08,550 --> 02:27:10,870
You got to prove you're a Linthorne.

2471
02:27:10,870 --> 02:27:15,150
Not to me, you know I got
my hopes pinned on you.

2472
02:27:15,150 --> 02:27:16,750
You got to prove it to yourself.

2473
02:27:19,030 --> 02:27:21,479
(dove cooing)

2474
02:27:21,479 --> 02:27:23,850
(Grover moans)

2475
02:27:23,850 --> 02:27:25,610
Everything all settled then?

2476
02:27:25,610 --> 02:27:27,510
- Everything's all taken care of, Pop.

2477
02:27:30,630 --> 02:27:32,050
- I'm proud of you, son.

2478
02:27:32,050 --> 02:27:34,120
You acted like a man tonight.

2479
02:27:34,120 --> 02:27:38,100
Leaves you feelin' better, doesn't it?

2480
02:27:38,100 --> 02:27:38,933
- Sure does, Pa.

2481
02:27:40,808 --> 02:27:42,110
- [Thomas] Good for you.

2482
02:27:42,110 --> 02:27:42,943
Come on.

2483
02:27:48,980 --> 02:27:52,080
- [Man] Ah, let me take
those bags for you, sir.

2484
02:27:52,080 --> 02:27:52,913
- Thanks.

2485
02:27:57,840 --> 02:28:01,460
You can't ever know what's
gonna come of things,

2486
02:28:01,460 --> 02:28:02,560
can you, Pop?

2487
02:28:02,560 --> 02:28:05,020
- Well, some things you can know.

2488
02:28:05,020 --> 02:28:07,360
Hard work, standing up for yourself,

2489
02:28:08,320 --> 02:28:09,910
you can know what comes of that.

2490
02:28:09,910 --> 02:28:11,700
- All aboard!
- Yes, indeed.

2491
02:28:13,690 --> 02:28:16,813
I certainly know what comes of that.

2492
02:28:16,813 --> 02:28:19,646
(slow soft music)

2493
02:28:25,938 --> 02:28:28,995
- God bless, son!

2494
02:28:28,995 --> 02:28:31,205
(bell dinging)

2495
02:28:31,205 --> 02:28:35,306
(train engine chugging)

2496
02:28:35,306 --> 02:28:38,389
(suitcases thudding)

2497
02:28:49,995 --> 02:28:52,836
(Kate groaning)

2498
02:28:52,836 --> 02:28:54,837
- Still won't...

2499
02:28:54,837 --> 02:28:55,920
Just another.

2500
02:28:56,756 --> 02:28:58,389
It's comin'!

2501
02:28:58,389 --> 02:29:01,972
Ah, there!
(Kate screaming)

2502
02:29:03,963 --> 02:29:05,290
You get into bed and stay there.

2503
02:29:05,290 --> 02:29:08,150
Drink them plum brandy
toddies for a day or two.

2504
02:29:08,150 --> 02:29:10,050
That's your reward for bein' so brave.

2505
02:29:12,301 --> 02:29:14,718
(Kate moans)

2506
02:29:17,560 --> 02:29:18,810
- You want another toddy?

2507
02:29:19,723 --> 02:29:21,723
- (sighs) Just bring me the damn bottle.

2508
02:29:23,540 --> 02:29:26,580
- Never heard you curse
in 25 years of marriage.

2509
02:29:26,580 --> 02:29:28,950
- The good Lord will forgive me.

2510
02:29:28,950 --> 02:29:29,783
Go!

2511
02:29:33,328 --> 02:29:36,078
(horse whinnies)

2512
02:29:38,076 --> 02:29:40,409
(puffs air)

2513
02:29:48,354 --> 02:29:51,104
(horse whinnies)

2514
02:29:56,067 --> 02:29:59,567
(shotgun shells rattling)

2515
02:30:03,178 --> 02:30:05,431
(door closes)

2516
02:30:05,431 --> 02:30:10,194
(snow crunching)
(Thomas panting)

2517
02:30:10,194 --> 02:30:13,062
(horse whinnies)

2518
02:30:13,062 --> 02:30:15,812
(Thomas panting)

2519
02:30:18,564 --> 02:30:22,051
(hooves clopping)
(shotgun cocks)

2520
02:30:22,051 --> 02:30:22,910
- [Thomas] I'm warnin' ya!

2521
02:30:22,910 --> 02:30:26,041
I'll shoot!

2522
02:30:26,041 --> 02:30:28,374
(gun fires)

2523
02:30:29,480 --> 02:30:30,880
- [Jed] What is it, Mr. Linthorne?

2524
02:30:30,880 --> 02:30:32,830
- Shot one of them gypsy horse thieves!

2525
02:30:37,838 --> 02:30:41,005
(slow dramatic music)

2526
02:30:44,502 --> 02:30:47,160
Oh God.

2527
02:30:47,160 --> 02:30:48,590
- Thomas!

2528
02:30:48,590 --> 02:30:51,340
(Thomas gasping)

2529
02:31:00,620 --> 02:31:04,130
- [Reverend] "For God shall
bring every work into judgment,

2530
02:31:05,620 --> 02:31:06,820
with every secret thing,

2531
02:31:08,220 --> 02:31:11,340
whether it be good, or
whether it be evil."

2532
02:31:13,032 --> 02:31:16,032
(slow somber music)

2533
02:31:21,319 --> 02:31:22,806
My friends, we are gathered here to pray

2534
02:31:22,806 --> 02:31:25,341
for the soul of Grover Linthorne.

2535
02:31:25,341 --> 02:31:30,341
(Thomas weeping)
(slow somber music)

2536
02:31:34,086 --> 02:31:36,836
(Thomas gasping)

2537
02:31:40,806 --> 02:31:43,556
(Thomas wailing)

2538
02:31:51,225 --> 02:31:53,956
(slow soft music)

2539
02:31:53,956 --> 02:31:56,456
(bird cawing)

2540
02:32:26,839 --> 02:32:29,422
(bell dinging)

2541
02:32:37,823 --> 02:32:40,323
(door closes)

2542
02:32:42,485 --> 02:32:44,180
- [Kate] Someone to see you in the parlor.

2543
02:32:48,260 --> 02:32:49,910
Maybe you better spruce up a bit.

2544
02:33:05,880 --> 02:33:08,440
(birds chirping)

2545
02:33:08,440 --> 02:33:10,780
- Looks like you bettered
yourself in the world.

2546
02:33:12,940 --> 02:33:15,150
Almost didn't know you, Lucille.

2547
02:33:15,150 --> 02:33:16,120
- We all change.

2548
02:33:17,100 --> 02:33:18,190
Everything changes.

2549
02:33:19,090 --> 02:33:20,080
Even our names.

2550
02:33:21,330 --> 02:33:23,280
You'll have to call me Mrs. Townley now.

2551
02:33:26,560 --> 02:33:27,460
Is Judith at home?

2552
02:33:29,140 --> 02:33:30,550
- No. (sighs)

2553
02:33:30,550 --> 02:33:32,940
She went into town for Sewin' Circle.

2554
02:33:34,400 --> 02:33:35,950
It's every Wednesday afternoon.

2555
02:33:37,060 --> 02:33:37,990
- Maybe it's best.

2556
02:33:38,950 --> 02:33:40,300
I should talk to you first.

2557
02:33:41,740 --> 02:33:43,010
I want you to let me take Judith back

2558
02:33:43,010 --> 02:33:44,800
to Cincinnati with me.

2559
02:33:44,800 --> 02:33:45,633
- Oh.

2560
02:33:48,968 --> 02:33:52,380
Well, she's old enough to
choose where she'll live.

2561
02:33:52,380 --> 02:33:54,230
- I know I haven't any claim anymore.

2562
02:33:55,580 --> 02:33:57,690
It's only that I think
I can help her a little.

2563
02:33:58,650 --> 02:34:01,390
- She's been treated
right since she came here.

2564
02:34:01,390 --> 02:34:02,670
She's happy.

2565
02:34:02,670 --> 02:34:04,960
- I have no doubt she is, Thomas.

2566
02:34:04,960 --> 02:34:07,200
I knew you would raise her
better than I ever could.

2567
02:34:08,207 --> 02:34:09,480
But she's a young woman now.

2568
02:34:10,366 --> 02:34:11,760
(slow dramatic music)
(birds chirping)

2569
02:34:11,760 --> 02:34:13,260
Is she really and truly happy?

2570
02:34:14,790 --> 02:34:16,040
Has anyone asked for her?

2571
02:34:18,940 --> 02:34:19,990
If she went away with me,

2572
02:34:19,990 --> 02:34:21,890
there wouldn't be any doubt about her.

2573
02:34:22,830 --> 02:34:25,470
She'd have a chance to marry
well, to have a family,

2574
02:34:26,470 --> 02:34:29,600
to have the life she deserves
after how we started her off.

2575
02:34:29,600 --> 02:34:31,410
- [Thomas] It's not for me to decide.

2576
02:34:31,410 --> 02:34:32,710
You'll have to ask Judith.

2577
02:34:33,901 --> 02:34:37,068
(slow dramatic music)

2578
02:34:38,060 --> 02:34:39,660
- I want you to ask her, Thomas.

2579
02:34:40,770 --> 02:34:43,350
I'm going to stay at the
Talmage House until Saturday.

2580
02:34:44,720 --> 02:34:46,220
I know you'll do what's right.

2581
02:34:48,111 --> 02:34:51,278
(slow dramatic music)

2582
02:34:55,529 --> 02:34:58,529
(crickets chirping)

2583
02:35:00,130 --> 02:35:02,630
- Come a day you don't
feel so young anymore,

2584
02:35:02,630 --> 02:35:04,880
you want somebody near ya to depend on.

2585
02:35:06,460 --> 02:35:07,560
Bone of your own bone.

2586
02:35:09,440 --> 02:35:10,490
Children of your own.

2587
02:35:13,743 --> 02:35:15,409
(sighs)

2588
02:35:15,409 --> 02:35:16,930
I want you to have that, Judith.

2589
02:35:18,970 --> 02:35:22,320
There's nothin' in this world
I don't want you to have.

2590
02:35:24,700 --> 02:35:25,800
I can't give you that.

2591
02:35:28,010 --> 02:35:28,843
Maybe she can.

2592
02:35:31,440 --> 02:35:32,740
You think about it anyway.

2593
02:35:34,350 --> 02:35:35,900
I'm not gonna say another word,

2594
02:35:37,070 --> 02:35:39,981
one way or the other. (sighs)

2595
02:35:39,981 --> 02:35:43,620
(slow soft music)

2596
02:35:43,620 --> 02:35:44,920
- I don't wanna leave you.

2597
02:35:46,520 --> 02:35:47,353
I won't.

2598
02:35:48,771 --> 02:35:51,604
(slow soft music)

2599
02:35:53,590 --> 02:35:55,790
- Of course you've gotta go.

2600
02:35:55,790 --> 02:35:58,560
You're gonna be a spinster if you don't.

2601
02:35:59,420 --> 02:36:01,040
- Do you want me to go?

2602
02:36:01,040 --> 02:36:03,990
- Think what your life will be
after we're gone if you stay.

2603
02:36:06,150 --> 02:36:09,350
- All the years I've lived
here, I never called you mama.

2604
02:36:10,640 --> 02:36:12,585
I guess I can't start now.

2605
02:36:12,585 --> 02:36:14,309
(Kate sighs)

2606
02:36:14,309 --> 02:36:16,480
- I may not be your mother,

2607
02:36:16,480 --> 02:36:18,480
but I've come to think of you as my own.

2608
02:36:20,000 --> 02:36:22,400
It broke my heart how brave you were.

2609
02:36:22,400 --> 02:36:23,540
Despite everything that happened,

2610
02:36:23,540 --> 02:36:26,090
you just went right alone
with a smile for everyone

2611
02:36:27,010 --> 02:36:28,690
and no bitterness in your heart.

2612
02:36:29,830 --> 02:36:31,080
- Thanks to you and Papa.

2613
02:36:33,030 --> 02:36:35,360
- You just go on being brave.

2614
02:36:35,360 --> 02:36:37,360
And you take the chance she's given you.

2615
02:36:38,764 --> 02:36:43,076
(crickets chirping)
(slow soft music)

2616
02:36:43,076 --> 02:36:46,076
(people chattering)

2617
02:36:54,820 --> 02:36:56,510
- You should go now.

2618
02:37:02,230 --> 02:37:04,530
- I love you better than
anyone else on earth.

2619
02:37:05,857 --> 02:37:08,690
(slow soft music)

2620
02:37:14,160 --> 02:37:17,160
(people chattering)

2621
02:37:32,552 --> 02:37:35,802
(crickets chirping)

2622
02:37:35,802 --> 02:37:38,302
(bird cawing)

2623
02:37:52,130 --> 02:37:54,430
- Never should've come to this.

2624
02:37:54,430 --> 02:37:56,020
- But it did.

2625
02:37:56,020 --> 02:37:59,080
- If I could trade
places with him, I would.

2626
02:37:59,940 --> 02:38:01,190
- The dead belong to God.

2627
02:38:02,890 --> 02:38:04,240
All we have are the livin'.

2628
02:38:05,237 --> 02:38:07,820
(birds cawing)

2629
02:38:12,189 --> 02:38:13,360
(Kate groans)

2630
02:38:13,360 --> 02:38:15,230
- Kate, Kate, what is it?

2631
02:38:15,230 --> 02:38:16,451
What is it?

2632
02:38:16,451 --> 02:38:19,034
(Kate sighing)

2633
02:38:21,700 --> 02:38:22,700
- My legs don't seem to be able

2634
02:38:22,700 --> 02:38:25,791
to carry me up and down
these hills anymore.

2635
02:38:25,791 --> 02:38:30,022
- Here.

2636
02:38:30,022 --> 02:38:33,199
(Thomas grunts)
(Kate laughs)

2637
02:38:33,199 --> 02:38:34,399
- I'm all right, Thomas.

2638
02:38:35,330 --> 02:38:37,710
Oh, you'll do yourself some damage.

2639
02:38:37,710 --> 02:38:40,311
- Oh, I'm just as good as I ever was.

2640
02:38:40,311 --> 02:38:41,870
- (sighs) I don't know about that.

2641
02:38:43,404 --> 02:38:45,704
I'd like to think I've
made some improvements.

2642
02:38:47,682 --> 02:38:52,682
(slow soft music)
(crickets chirping)

2643
02:38:53,841 --> 02:38:56,924
(footsteps thudding)

2644
02:38:58,800 --> 02:39:00,440
- What's the matter with her, Doc?

2645
02:39:00,440 --> 02:39:03,450
- We can do our best to
make her comfortable.

2646
02:39:03,450 --> 02:39:05,200
Beyond that, it's in God's hands.

2647
02:39:08,650 --> 02:39:09,483
- Well you,

2648
02:39:10,330 --> 02:39:12,710
you might as well tell me the worst of it.

2649
02:39:12,710 --> 02:39:15,240
- A day will come, I'm
not sure exactly when,

2650
02:39:16,180 --> 02:39:18,460
her kidneys will just stop functioning.

2651
02:39:20,870 --> 02:39:23,710
- Well if I took her to the
big hospital in Columbus?

2652
02:39:23,710 --> 02:39:26,130
- I would be the first to
advise you to take her there,

2653
02:39:26,130 --> 02:39:29,120
or New York City, or London,

2654
02:39:30,640 --> 02:39:33,190
if I thought there was a
procedure that would help.

2655
02:39:35,140 --> 02:39:37,340
There is no known cure for renal failure.

2656
02:39:38,420 --> 02:39:40,920
There is nothing that anyone can do.

2657
02:39:42,710 --> 02:39:43,917
I'm sorry, Thomas.

2658
02:39:47,647 --> 02:39:50,480
(slow soft music)

2659
02:39:54,841 --> 02:39:57,341
(door closes)

2660
02:40:04,870 --> 02:40:06,450
- Charlotte's comin' to visit.

2661
02:40:09,767 --> 02:40:12,420
(Kate sighs)

2662
02:40:12,420 --> 02:40:14,751
- That's good.

2663
02:40:14,751 --> 02:40:17,501
(horse whinnies)

2664
02:40:20,433 --> 02:40:23,016
(birds cawing)

2665
02:40:29,785 --> 02:40:32,702
(knocking on door)

2666
02:40:35,466 --> 02:40:38,049
(birds cawing)

2667
02:40:42,302 --> 02:40:44,440
(door creaking)

2668
02:40:44,440 --> 02:40:45,273
- It's your Ma.

2669
02:40:47,260 --> 02:40:48,210
- I'll get my coat.

2670
02:40:49,769 --> 02:40:52,186
(door thuds)

2671
02:40:53,409 --> 02:40:56,242
(slow soft music)

2672
02:41:07,351 --> 02:41:11,518
- [Thomas] That's somebody
here to see you, Kate.

2673
02:41:16,150 --> 02:41:16,983
- Hock.

2674
02:41:21,002 --> 02:41:23,817
(sighs) You've come home.

2675
02:41:23,817 --> 02:41:26,785
- [Hock] Yes, Mama.

2676
02:41:26,785 --> 02:41:30,186
- How I've longed to hear you say so.

2677
02:41:30,186 --> 02:41:33,019
(slow soft music)

2678
02:41:36,738 --> 02:41:39,155
(Kate sighs)

2679
02:41:45,041 --> 02:41:47,624
(birds cawing)

2680
02:42:02,050 --> 02:42:05,050
(footsteps padding)

2681
02:42:19,384 --> 02:42:21,884
(Kate groans)

2682
02:42:29,450 --> 02:42:31,780
- How you feelin'?
- Content.

2683
02:42:33,580 --> 02:42:34,580
How are you feelin'?

2684
02:42:36,010 --> 02:42:37,960
- I'm thinkin' of making Hock an offer.

2685
02:42:40,540 --> 02:42:43,180
I'm thinking of signing
Linthorne Farm over to him.

2686
02:42:48,130 --> 02:42:49,530
- Open the curtains, Thomas.

2687
02:42:50,420 --> 02:42:51,270
Let the light in.

2688
02:42:59,954 --> 02:43:02,704
(Kate quivering)

2689
02:43:08,060 --> 02:43:09,400
Come lay down beside me.

2690
02:43:18,714 --> 02:43:21,547
(slow soft music)

2691
02:43:29,243 --> 02:43:31,047
(Kate laughs)

2692
02:43:31,047 --> 02:43:35,214
There were so many times
I regretted marrying you.

2693
02:43:36,438 --> 02:43:37,924
(Kate sighs)

2694
02:43:37,924 --> 02:43:41,142
Weren't there times you felt the same?

2695
02:43:41,142 --> 02:43:46,008
- Oh, Kate, I can't-
- Shh, it's all right.

2696
02:43:46,008 --> 02:43:48,176
You can say it.

2697
02:43:48,176 --> 02:43:51,713
(slow soft music)

2698
02:43:51,713 --> 02:43:56,439
- There were times.

2699
02:43:56,439 --> 02:44:00,512
- Here I am.

2700
02:44:00,512 --> 02:44:05,512
And I have no regrets, none at all.

2701
02:44:06,600 --> 02:44:09,263
Do you understand, Thomas?

2702
02:44:09,263 --> 02:44:12,302
(slow soft music)

2703
02:44:12,302 --> 02:44:16,528
- How can you forgive me?

2704
02:44:16,528 --> 02:44:20,142
- It is forgiven.

2705
02:44:20,142 --> 02:44:23,511
You'll know it someday, I know it now.

2706
02:44:23,511 --> 02:44:26,344
(slow soft music)

2707
02:44:41,429 --> 02:44:45,351
Ease your heart, my love.

2708
02:44:45,351 --> 02:44:50,351
God loves you.

2709
02:44:50,559 --> 02:44:52,295
- [Child] Grandpa, we're here.

2710
02:44:52,295 --> 02:44:54,743
- [Child] Grandpa, where are you?

2711
02:44:54,743 --> 02:44:57,318
- It's Charlotte.

2712
02:44:57,318 --> 02:44:59,941
She's got the whole family with her.

2713
02:44:59,941 --> 02:45:02,774
(slow soft music)

2714
02:45:07,583 --> 02:45:10,000
(Kate sighs)

2715
02:45:11,152 --> 02:45:14,017
- Grandpa!
- Hello, Billy.

2716
02:45:14,017 --> 02:45:15,899
Nancy.

2717
02:45:15,899 --> 02:45:18,678
There's my Susanna.
- How is she?

2718
02:45:18,678 --> 02:45:20,744
- Go on up.

2719
02:45:20,744 --> 02:45:24,749
She's gonna be so happy to see you.

2720
02:45:24,749 --> 02:45:27,022
(Thomas grunts)

2721
02:45:27,022 --> 02:45:31,997
(slow soft music)
(birds chirping)

2722
02:45:31,997 --> 02:45:34,853
- Mama?

2723
02:45:34,853 --> 02:45:39,614
Mama?

2724
02:45:39,614 --> 02:45:44,614
(weeping) Mama?

2725
02:45:46,716 --> 02:45:51,716
Mama?

2726
02:45:52,413 --> 02:45:57,413
(Charlotte weeping)
(slow somber music)

2727
02:46:31,052 --> 02:46:36,052
- Goodbye, my love.

2728
02:46:46,830 --> 02:46:49,497
(clock ticking)

2729
02:47:04,358 --> 02:47:06,941
(birds cawing)

2730
02:47:30,413 --> 02:47:33,413
(crickets chirping)

2731
02:47:39,006 --> 02:47:41,766
Place is lookin' pretty good, Hock.

2732
02:47:41,766 --> 02:47:44,662
- It's comin' along.

2733
02:47:44,662 --> 02:47:46,105
- Seems an odd thing to do,

2734
02:47:46,105 --> 02:47:48,893
work so hard fixin' up
old man Orly's property

2735
02:47:48,893 --> 02:47:50,950
while he bleeds you dry.

2736
02:47:50,950 --> 02:47:53,582
- Maybe it ain't Orly's property no more.

2737
02:47:53,582 --> 02:47:55,124
- He sold it?

2738
02:47:55,124 --> 02:47:56,422
- Sat down with old man Orly

2739
02:47:56,422 --> 02:47:58,046
and showed him how I'd
get him twice the profit

2740
02:47:58,046 --> 02:47:59,645
out of his land he's gettin',

2741
02:47:59,645 --> 02:48:02,984
if he'd give me title on this
little piece I'm croppin'.

2742
02:48:02,984 --> 02:48:06,273
So I'm runnin' his 1.200 acres and my 20.

2743
02:48:06,273 --> 02:48:07,703
- That's good, Hock.

2744
02:48:07,703 --> 02:48:09,503
Got yourself a bit of land.

2745
02:48:09,503 --> 02:48:12,319
(birds cawing)

2746
02:48:12,319 --> 02:48:17,319
Elva must be gettin'
pretty close to her time.

2747
02:48:17,865 --> 02:48:20,975
- I guess so.

2748
02:48:20,975 --> 02:48:24,902
- Maybe you have a boy this time.

2749
02:48:24,902 --> 02:48:27,493
Wait till you see him.

2750
02:48:27,493 --> 02:48:32,493
Wait till you hold your
first born son in your arms.

2751
02:48:43,815 --> 02:48:46,430
- That's your watch.

2752
02:48:46,430 --> 02:48:47,966
- No.

2753
02:48:47,966 --> 02:48:49,913
It's yours.

2754
02:48:49,913 --> 02:48:52,364
You earned it a long time ago.

2755
02:48:52,364 --> 02:48:56,676
- Oh, I got a watch of my own now.

2756
02:48:56,676 --> 02:49:01,085
- (sighs) So many mistakes I've made.

2757
02:49:01,085 --> 02:49:03,284
It pains me to remember that
night you claimed this watch

2758
02:49:03,284 --> 02:49:06,349
after your confirmation and

2759
02:49:06,349 --> 02:49:11,318
I didn't give it to you.

2760
02:49:11,318 --> 02:49:15,044
Your mother always said
I was too easy on Grover

2761
02:49:15,044 --> 02:49:18,251
and too hard on you.

2762
02:49:18,251 --> 02:49:22,545
I was right to be hard on you.

2763
02:49:22,545 --> 02:49:25,849
I know what it takes to farm.

2764
02:49:25,849 --> 02:49:30,403
I was out to make a man of you, and I did.

2765
02:49:30,403 --> 02:49:35,403
Only I should've let you know
why I was so hard on you.

2766
02:49:36,589 --> 02:49:41,589
And I should've let you know that I,

2767
02:49:43,644 --> 02:49:44,694
that I-

2768
02:49:44,694 --> 02:49:47,468
- Well why don't you just
say what you really want?

2769
02:49:47,468 --> 02:49:49,216
You want me to come back to Linthorne Farm

2770
02:49:49,216 --> 02:49:51,317
'cause you can't do the work anymore.

2771
02:49:51,317 --> 02:49:54,144
- No.

2772
02:49:54,144 --> 02:49:58,407
I want you to have the farm.

2773
02:49:58,407 --> 02:50:00,348
And if that doesn't make things right,

2774
02:50:00,348 --> 02:50:04,728
you just, you just tell
me what it is I can do.

2775
02:50:04,728 --> 02:50:09,708
- I'd like it if you let
me get back to my hoin'.

2776
02:50:09,708 --> 02:50:12,722
- I love you, son.

2777
02:50:12,722 --> 02:50:15,722
(slow somber music)

2778
02:50:22,341 --> 02:50:25,091
(paper rustling)

2779
02:50:48,743 --> 02:50:51,629
- Congratulations, Mr. Linthorne.

2780
02:50:51,629 --> 02:50:54,568
You are the father of a boy. (laughs)

2781
02:50:54,568 --> 02:50:56,277
Finally.

2782
02:50:56,277 --> 02:50:58,860
(baby fussing)

2783
02:51:01,602 --> 02:51:03,152
(Elva laughs)

2784
02:51:03,152 --> 02:51:06,552
- Isn't he beautiful?

2785
02:51:06,552 --> 02:51:09,043
(baby fussing)

2786
02:51:09,043 --> 02:51:14,043
Oh, here.

2787
02:51:21,281 --> 02:51:22,769
- Look at your brother.

2788
02:51:22,769 --> 02:51:25,352
(baby fussing)

2789
02:51:31,758 --> 02:51:34,758
(slow somber music)

2790
02:51:57,433 --> 02:52:00,183
(weeds rustling)

2791
02:52:03,526 --> 02:52:06,193
(Thomas groans)

2792
02:52:26,508 --> 02:52:29,258
(Thomas gasping)

2793
02:52:35,763 --> 02:52:38,596
(Thomas grunting)

2794
02:52:43,562 --> 02:52:46,145
(Thomas sighs)

2795
02:52:47,885 --> 02:52:50,885
(slow somber music)

2796
02:53:40,789 --> 02:53:43,548
- [Hocking] Pa!

2797
02:53:43,548 --> 02:53:45,101
(laughs)

2798
02:53:45,101 --> 02:53:50,101
Pa!

2799
02:53:54,300 --> 02:53:59,300
Pa.

2800
02:54:02,308 --> 02:54:04,391
(laughs)

2801
02:54:27,140 --> 02:54:30,629
I guess I love you, too, Pop.

2802
02:54:30,629 --> 02:54:33,629
(slow somber music)

2803
02:54:51,779 --> 02:54:56,029
(light uplifting orchestral music)

2804
02:55:51,945 --> 02:55:54,272
(crickets chirping)

2805
02:55:54,272 --> 02:55:57,899
(whippoorwill calls)

2806
02:55:57,899 --> 02:56:01,149
(slow dramatic music)
