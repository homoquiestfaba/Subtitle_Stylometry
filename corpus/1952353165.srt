1
00:00:10,424 --> 00:00:15,273
I got a little riddle for you.
Who's 6'2", smokes like a chimney,

2
00:00:15,662 --> 00:00:20,511
likes to steal and is currently
totally fucked?

3
00:00:21,301 --> 00:00:23,282
You guessed it. Me.

4
00:00:24,404 --> 00:00:25,953
Neal Bannen.

5
00:00:26,173 --> 00:00:29,121
My father always called me a quitter.

6
00:00:30,777 --> 00:00:33,146
I had to live with that my whole life.

7
00:00:33,147 --> 00:00:37,316
Now, you've probably got a lotta
questions, like, why is he fucked?

8
00:00:37,317 --> 00:00:40,664
Why is he smoking
in a Nicotine Anonymous meeting?

9
00:00:41,555 --> 00:00:43,434
And who is that?

10
00:00:45,726 --> 00:00:47,560
So, that's Madison, by the way,

11
00:00:47,561 --> 00:00:51,670
and we'll get to her and why she's got
my wallet a little later.

12
00:00:51,966 --> 00:00:54,460
For now, I just know
that I had every intention...

13
00:00:54,461 --> 00:00:57,236
of getting out
of the criminal lifestyle.

14
00:00:57,237 --> 00:01:00,083
My friends in the back. We welcome you.

15
00:01:01,942 --> 00:01:03,992
Maybe some new friends.

16
00:01:08,048 --> 00:01:09,282
So I'm guessing you don't have

17
00:01:09,283 --> 00:01:11,617
- the 150 G's to pay Sonny.
- Where's the fucking money, Bannen?

18
00:01:11,618 --> 00:01:13,953
That's why you're pretending
like you don't see us when we're...

19
00:01:13,954 --> 00:01:16,389
- chasing you all over the city.
- Now you can beg for mercy.

20
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:18,201
Not exactly, guys.

21
00:01:19,993 --> 00:01:21,906
Kill me if you want,

22
00:01:23,564 --> 00:01:26,399
but if you give me a week,
I'll give you an extra 100 G's.

23
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,610
Wait, wait, wait, hold on.
I'm getting way ahead of myself here.

24
00:01:30,437 --> 00:01:32,672
So I should probably mention
that the goons...

25
00:01:32,673 --> 00:01:37,783
work for the notorious prison gangster
Sonny Carr, who I owe a little money to.

26
00:01:39,046 --> 00:01:43,462
Don't let his Latin flair fool you.
He will shoot you in the face.

27
00:01:43,951 --> 00:01:45,117
Let me back up a bit.

28
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:48,588
We got the studio loft job,
hot chick that works at front desk,

29
00:01:48,589 --> 00:01:50,122
Mr. B trying to hunt me down.

30
00:01:50,123 --> 00:01:52,191
Right, this is probably a good time
to bring up Mr. B

31
00:01:52,192 --> 00:01:54,994
and how I used to work for him
before I went freelance.

32
00:01:54,995 --> 00:01:57,238
He's a man of many virtues.

33
00:01:57,965 --> 00:02:01,278
Patience isn't one of them.

34
00:02:02,569 --> 00:02:07,554
Anyway, I'm trying to triple my money...
Right, so here we are at the beginning.

35
00:02:13,513 --> 00:02:18,657
I had 50 G's to my name,
but I owed Sonny 150. Today.

36
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,487
I had one last job lined up but I figured,

37
00:02:21,488 --> 00:02:24,835
hey, why not play a little cards,
triple my money,

38
00:02:25,025 --> 00:02:28,110
and then pay off my debts
the honorable way?

39
00:02:29,229 --> 00:02:31,864
In these situations,
I always think of Grandpa's principles,

40
00:02:31,865 --> 00:02:35,951
which he liked to call the Bannen Way.
Let me give you an example.

41
00:02:41,241 --> 00:02:42,375
I know what you're thinking,

42
00:02:42,376 --> 00:02:46,326
"If you owe Sonny 150,000
and you've got that in your hands,

43
00:02:46,413 --> 00:02:51,466
"you should probably quit. "
But, hey, we're all human.

44
00:02:53,887 --> 00:02:55,402
I'm all in.

45
00:03:17,444 --> 00:03:20,654
Hey, Bannen, it's Zeke.
Where the hell are you?

46
00:03:20,714 --> 00:03:23,697
Did you forget we have our last job today?

47
00:03:24,051 --> 00:03:27,466
Get down to the studio complex downtown,
all right?

48
00:03:38,498 --> 00:03:41,057
It's D-day, Zeke, and...
we're a little short.

49
00:03:41,058 --> 00:03:42,635
What're you talking about?

50
00:03:42,636 --> 00:03:44,970
We've got two seconds flat
to pull off this job...

51
00:03:44,971 --> 00:03:46,906
and you're talking to me
about short?

52
00:03:46,907 --> 00:03:49,775
I had kings.
What was I supposed to do, fold?

53
00:03:49,776 --> 00:03:52,545
I'm here.
Let's just visualize the game plan.

54
00:03:52,546 --> 00:03:54,413
All right, let's do this.

55
00:03:54,414 --> 00:03:56,849
When you get in the lobby, you're gonna
convince the manager...

56
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:59,011
to give you the key
to Haskell's studio loft.

57
00:03:59,012 --> 00:04:01,087
So I'm impersonating
this Haskell guy?

58
00:04:01,088 --> 00:04:04,490
Right. Go out the back.
On your left will be a building.

59
00:04:04,491 --> 00:04:08,475
Down the hall,
and you're looking for J345.

60
00:04:09,563 --> 00:04:12,331
You're gonna look for a laptop on a desk.

61
00:04:12,332 --> 00:04:15,901
You take care of the transfer,
I'll take care of the rest.

62
00:04:15,902 --> 00:04:19,405
Hey, Bannen, I know you said
we were done working for Mr. B, but...

63
00:04:19,406 --> 00:04:20,973
You're seriously bringing up
Mr. B right now?

64
00:04:20,974 --> 00:04:23,409
All right, yeah.
Don't get all jelly at me.

65
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:27,079
- I just thought that maybe he could help.
- Not an option.

66
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:30,961
Roger that. All right,
we'll just focus on the studio job.

67
00:04:31,385 --> 00:04:34,060
Do you have your video feed glasses?

68
00:04:38,258 --> 00:04:40,000
And roger that.

69
00:04:41,194 --> 00:04:44,472
- All right, work your magic, Bannen.
- Sorry.

70
00:04:45,465 --> 00:04:46,741
Shit.

71
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,142
Shit!

72
00:04:49,903 --> 00:04:52,138
- Hello.
- What happened to the regular manager?

73
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:54,840
- Hi.
- I seem to have lost my key.

74
00:04:54,841 --> 00:04:57,323
I must have left it in my...

75
00:04:57,944 --> 00:05:00,528
Jesus. Those eyes.

76
00:05:02,482 --> 00:05:03,645
Let me just verify your info.

77
00:05:03,646 --> 00:05:07,395
Okay, tell her
your name is Allen Haskell.

78
00:05:07,621 --> 00:05:09,429
Haskell, Allen.

79
00:05:10,557 --> 00:05:12,372
A-L-L-E-N.

80
00:05:13,827 --> 00:05:16,673
Can I get a date? Of birth?

81
00:05:17,431 --> 00:05:18,528
Keep your pants on, Bannen.

82
00:05:18,529 --> 00:05:20,699
- Sure.
- It's 4-22-47.

83
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:24,786
- 4-22-47.
- You look fantastic for 60, by the way.

84
00:05:28,241 --> 00:05:31,177
Unfortunately,
we don't have any spare keys.

85
00:05:31,178 --> 00:05:33,813
What? No. She's new.
She doesn't know what she's talking about.

86
00:05:33,814 --> 00:05:37,216
But I...
do have the master key.

87
00:05:37,217 --> 00:05:41,120
No, no, no, no! That is not an option.
Tell her to look in the drawer.

88
00:05:41,121 --> 00:05:42,288
Should I escort you myself?

89
00:05:42,289 --> 00:05:45,291
"No, thank you, ma'am, but if you'll
just check the desk drawer"...

90
00:05:45,292 --> 00:05:46,826
- tell her that, Bannen.
- Okay.

91
00:05:46,827 --> 00:05:53,439
Okay? It's not okay! It's not okay at all!
You need to focus. Please listen to me.

92
00:05:53,533 --> 00:05:58,237
Oh, God, Bannen, we have a job to do.
You're gonna blow this whole job.

93
00:05:58,238 --> 00:06:00,969
You will not
engage with this girl.

94
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:03,442
Okay, all right,
now that she's let you in,

95
00:06:03,443 --> 00:06:08,826
you'll say: "Thank you and good day",
but you will not engage!

96
00:06:09,349 --> 00:06:13,319
All right, just listen to me, Neal Bannen.
All right? We have a job to do.

97
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:19,409
Do not, I repeat, do not...
Oh, God. He engaged.

98
00:06:22,295 --> 00:06:26,006
Hey. Okay, Bannen...
Bannen, I need you to focus right now.

99
00:06:26,132 --> 00:06:27,874
Find the laptop.

100
00:06:28,568 --> 00:06:31,710
We have a small window of time here.

101
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:38,325
I have some quick business to do.

102
00:06:38,845 --> 00:06:42,658
Oh, God. One second, one second.

103
00:06:43,884 --> 00:06:47,834
- Dude, get in here.
- Go! Get out! Get out!

104
00:06:49,222 --> 00:06:51,390
Bannen, thank you, thank you, thank you.

105
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:55,160
Okay, go to the accounts folder.
That's it. That's it right there.

106
00:06:55,161 --> 00:07:00,305
Now, set up the transfer to the external
and I'll take care of the rest, all right?

107
00:07:02,402 --> 00:07:07,854
- Looks like there's two more accounts.
- No, no, no. No other accounts, Bannen.

108
00:07:08,675 --> 00:07:12,745
There's only one unsecured. All right?
We don't have time for other accounts.

109
00:07:12,746 --> 00:07:15,626
I don't care. Let's do it.

110
00:07:18,351 --> 00:07:21,129
Bannen, how about this? Get the 100,000.

111
00:07:21,555 --> 00:07:24,156
All right, Bannen, remember
what your grandfather used to say,

112
00:07:24,157 --> 00:07:28,694
"A winner knows when to quit,
a loser quits too early or too late,"

113
00:07:28,695 --> 00:07:32,031
as in quit having sex now!

114
00:07:32,032 --> 00:07:34,266
All right, if you go for
more than one account,

115
00:07:34,267 --> 00:07:38,070
they're gonna freeze all three
and we're gonna wind up with nothing.

116
00:07:38,071 --> 00:07:40,472
Shit! Haskell just entered the building.

117
00:07:40,473 --> 00:07:42,708
Bannen, I need to know
if we're going after the one account.

118
00:07:42,709 --> 00:07:43,809
We're just going after the one account.

119
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:45,477
- Yeah.
- Yeah!

120
00:07:45,478 --> 00:07:48,480
Is that a "yeah" to me on the one account
or to the girl?

121
00:07:48,481 --> 00:07:51,156
- Yes!
- Okay. Now, B, get out of there now!

122
00:07:51,184 --> 00:07:54,861
He's walking down the hall!
He's walking down the hall!

123
00:07:55,855 --> 00:08:00,339
Please, please get out of there right now,
all right? This isn't funny, man.

124
00:08:03,863 --> 00:08:05,605
Get out of there right now!
Please get out!

125
00:08:08,335 --> 00:08:10,112
Go, go, go!

126
00:08:17,444 --> 00:08:19,528
- Yes!
- Yeah!

127
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,091
- Dirty boy!
- Yeah!

128
00:08:26,386 --> 00:08:27,730
Allen!

129
00:08:40,533 --> 00:08:42,480
Transfer is complete.

130
00:08:43,937 --> 00:08:45,714
On both our ends.

131
00:08:57,817 --> 00:08:59,366
Thanks, bro.

132
00:09:02,455 --> 00:09:05,665
Biggest pimp ever.

133
00:09:19,773 --> 00:09:21,254
Hey, Neal.

134
00:09:24,244 --> 00:09:27,124
Get in. Your uncle wants to talk to you.

135
00:09:34,821 --> 00:09:38,891
When a mob guy probes you for answers,
you gotta watch what you say.

136
00:09:38,892 --> 00:09:43,395
When he's your uncle, well, same deal,
just slightly more uncomfortable.

137
00:09:43,396 --> 00:09:46,665
I understand you've gotten yourself
in a bit of trouble with Sonny.

138
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:50,411
- Nothing I can't handle.
- Manni, have Veronica join us.

139
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:55,050
Drink?

140
00:09:57,143 --> 00:10:00,160
Yeah, the old falling off the wagon thing.

141
00:10:05,952 --> 00:10:08,387
I've never seen this shot
with you and my folks.

142
00:10:08,388 --> 00:10:10,028
Happier times.

143
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:15,801
Now, you should know this.
As a rule, I don't go to anybody.

144
00:10:17,063 --> 00:10:19,113
I make them come to me.

145
00:10:19,466 --> 00:10:21,345
That was another one
of Granddad's principles.

146
00:10:24,804 --> 00:10:28,617
So next time I call,
answer the goddamn phone.

147
00:10:29,275 --> 00:10:31,393
I'm better with texting.

148
00:10:32,545 --> 00:10:35,948
Your charm has really run out, though,
with your friend Sonny.

149
00:10:35,949 --> 00:10:39,398
If it was up to him,
you'd be floating in the river.

150
00:10:39,452 --> 00:10:41,365
What do you owe him?

151
00:10:41,521 --> 00:10:45,334
Would $250,000 cover it?

152
00:10:47,193 --> 00:10:51,404
How about 500?
Let's just make it the American dream.

153
00:10:51,998 --> 00:10:53,740
$1,000,000.

154
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,611
Neal Bannen, millionaire.

155
00:11:04,811 --> 00:11:07,579
I'm offering you a chance
to square your debt.

156
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:12,724
Maybe a little place in the Bahamas,
fancy cars, women.

157
00:11:17,157 --> 00:11:20,834
- Or whatever you want. I don't care.
- Sounds intriguing.

158
00:11:21,728 --> 00:11:27,373
Suffice it to say, that box
is a valuable piece of merchandise.

159
00:11:28,168 --> 00:11:31,310
Yeah, I think I saw one of these at IKEA.

160
00:11:33,373 --> 00:11:35,150
Yeah, The Mensch.

161
00:11:35,408 --> 00:11:40,212
Though he is heavily guarded,
he will not be expecting someone like you.

162
00:11:40,213 --> 00:11:44,493
Wait. Hold up. You want me to steal
the box from The Mensch?

163
00:11:44,851 --> 00:11:48,754
The Mensch was a former rabbi
who later found a home in the Jewish mob.

164
00:11:48,755 --> 00:11:51,590
And he also got into the sex trade biz.

165
00:11:51,591 --> 00:11:53,106
I'm not only the president...

166
00:11:53,526 --> 00:11:55,473
And he wasn't much of a mensch.

167
00:12:00,533 --> 00:12:04,175
How you procure the box
is entirely up to you.

168
00:12:05,972 --> 00:12:10,354
That was your grandfather's.
His father gave it to him after the war.

169
00:12:10,777 --> 00:12:14,419
My father gave it to me
when he realized he was dying.

170
00:12:17,617 --> 00:12:19,098
And now...

171
00:12:26,292 --> 00:12:30,310
Yeah, I'm not really
a gun-toting kind of thief.

172
00:12:32,899 --> 00:12:34,448
You will be.

173
00:12:41,708 --> 00:12:44,452
You know what I like about you, Neal?

174
00:12:44,677 --> 00:12:48,354
Even when you're in a position
where you have no choice,

175
00:12:49,382 --> 00:12:51,966
you convince yourself that you do.

176
00:12:53,386 --> 00:12:55,854
No. No! I'm not giving you the 100,000.

177
00:12:55,855 --> 00:12:56,922
- You're just gonna blow it...
- Come on.

178
00:12:56,923 --> 00:12:58,357
...on another card game, okay?

179
00:12:58,358 --> 00:13:00,692
Just not until
we get the whole amount for Sonny.

180
00:13:00,693 --> 00:13:04,363
Now, this job that Mr. B wants us to do
looks right up your alley.

181
00:13:04,364 --> 00:13:05,430
All right? Check it out.

182
00:13:05,431 --> 00:13:08,467
The Mensch is having
one of his mail-order bride galas

183
00:13:08,468 --> 00:13:11,403
in a couple of days
at one of his storage facilities.

184
00:13:11,404 --> 00:13:14,006
Even if I'm going to do this job,
which I'm not,

185
00:13:14,007 --> 00:13:16,975
I need more than you jerking off
behind your computer.

186
00:13:16,976 --> 00:13:20,618
- Okay, first of all...
- And that's when I met Madison.

187
00:13:21,447 --> 00:13:24,623
Dude, this is gonna be so cake sauce.
Look...

188
00:13:26,252 --> 00:13:31,203
It's just gonna be a bunch of rich d-bags
and hot Russian broads walking around,

189
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:33,568
looking to get some action.

190
00:13:35,828 --> 00:13:39,345
A million dollars. $1,000,000.

191
00:13:41,534 --> 00:13:42,844
Sorry.

192
00:13:44,604 --> 00:13:46,405
Bannen, you're just gonna stop walking

193
00:13:46,406 --> 00:13:49,875
when I'm right in the middle of making
an important executive decision?

194
00:13:49,876 --> 00:13:53,826
I gotta grab something out of my car.
I'll catch up with you.

195
00:13:55,415 --> 00:14:00,502
All right.
I'll just go over all of this on my own.

196
00:14:03,723 --> 00:14:06,273
I'm sorry. You okay?

197
00:14:31,751 --> 00:14:33,027
What?

198
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:07,292
Always be the summoner,
never the summoned.

199
00:15:08,087 --> 00:15:11,229
Don't do it, Bannen.
You're breaking the rule.

200
00:15:19,732 --> 00:15:22,715
Excuse me, sir, ever heard of a crosswalk?

201
00:15:24,337 --> 00:15:25,937
- Hey.
- Can I see some ID?

202
00:15:25,938 --> 00:15:28,006
It wouldn't happen to be
in any of those three wallets, would it?

203
00:15:28,007 --> 00:15:28,974
- No, I just...
- Yeah, okay.

204
00:15:28,975 --> 00:15:30,036
Why don't you just step over
to the side...

205
00:15:30,037 --> 00:15:31,187
Oh, my God...

206
00:15:39,485 --> 00:15:42,570
Back again. Did you miss us?

207
00:15:44,023 --> 00:15:45,824
Tell us what to do here, Neal.

208
00:15:45,825 --> 00:15:48,493
- Where the fuck is he?
- Interrogation.

209
00:15:48,494 --> 00:15:50,134
- Which one?
- B.

210
00:16:01,941 --> 00:16:05,857
So here we are.
Third strike, no more outs.

211
00:16:08,114 --> 00:16:12,064
Just months after you told me
you were gonna be a better man.

212
00:16:13,386 --> 00:16:15,786
If you're convicted,
that's life in prison.

213
00:16:15,787 --> 00:16:19,737
No more fancy cars,
fancy clothes, women,

214
00:16:20,526 --> 00:16:23,061
just you in an orange jumpsuit
pitching nickels against the wall

215
00:16:23,062 --> 00:16:24,296
with a bunch of homeboys

216
00:16:24,297 --> 00:16:28,349
who're gonna take a deep-seated
interest in your last name.

217
00:16:32,305 --> 00:16:36,357
You two take a walk.
I want a private conversation with my son.

218
00:16:37,977 --> 00:16:41,221
Yeah, this is my dad's version
of quality time.

219
00:16:46,686 --> 00:16:49,634
I know about the money
you owe Sonny Carr.

220
00:16:54,994 --> 00:16:58,130
And I know about your dealings
with my brother.

221
00:16:58,131 --> 00:17:02,210
The D.A. wants you convicted,
locked up, key thrown away.

222
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:05,803
She wants to set an example
for the precinct,

223
00:17:05,804 --> 00:17:09,454
and I'm not totally opposed
to that idea.

224
00:17:11,677 --> 00:17:13,021
But...

225
00:17:16,516 --> 00:17:20,534
I can make her cut you a deal.
Total immunity.

226
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:32,738
That perked up your ears, didn't it, huh?
Keep your virgin ass out of the state pen.

227
00:17:33,099 --> 00:17:37,811
It's what your grand-dad would call
appealing to a man's self-serving greed.

228
00:17:42,441 --> 00:17:44,081
Let me guess.

229
00:17:44,777 --> 00:17:47,452
You want me to turn states on Mr. B?

230
00:17:47,847 --> 00:17:50,192
It's your last chance, kiddo.

231
00:17:57,823 --> 00:17:59,235
Hey, Dad?

232
00:18:08,467 --> 00:18:13,213
My father always called me a quitter.
I had to live with that my whole life.

233
00:18:13,539 --> 00:18:15,191
It wasn't until the day he died...

234
00:18:15,474 --> 00:18:19,560
After posting bail, I'm back
to square one. Broke and screwed.

235
00:18:19,645 --> 00:18:21,546
Third strike, no more outs.

236
00:18:21,547 --> 00:18:24,950
I understand you've gotten yourself
in a bit of trouble with Sonny.

237
00:18:24,951 --> 00:18:27,719
Taking no action means 25 years in prison.

238
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,955
I'm offering you a chance
to square your debt...

239
00:18:29,956 --> 00:18:32,424
your virgin ass
outta the state pen.

240
00:18:32,425 --> 00:18:34,826
Or I could turn states on Mr. B,

241
00:18:34,827 --> 00:18:37,929
which means having
to look over my shoulder forever.

242
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:40,098
And I know about your dealings
with my brother.

243
00:18:40,099 --> 00:18:41,466
A 1,000,000 dollars.

244
00:18:41,467 --> 00:18:42,915
Or I could work for Mr. B,

245
00:18:42,966 --> 00:18:45,837
pay off my debts, and run from
the police my whole life.

246
00:18:45,838 --> 00:18:49,574
Even when you're in a position
where you have no choice,

247
00:18:49,575 --> 00:18:52,210
you convince yourself
that you do.

248
00:18:52,211 --> 00:18:54,158
It was decision time.

249
00:18:59,452 --> 00:19:01,365
Kill me if you want,

250
00:19:01,721 --> 00:19:05,500
but if you give me a week,
I'll get you an extra 100 G's.

251
00:19:05,591 --> 00:19:09,694
Not for Sonny, for you. Just, you know,
tell him you couldn't find me.

252
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:12,313
When in need, appeal to greed.

253
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,584
What if we said we want 200 G's?

254
00:19:17,136 --> 00:19:19,618
Well, Finch, I guess I say okay.

255
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,010
Come on, man.
Where you gonna find that kind of money?

256
00:19:25,011 --> 00:19:27,479
Mr. B hired me to do a job,

257
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:30,531
retrieve a box
that somebody stole from him.

258
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:35,487
Word on the street says there's something
pretty special in that box.

259
00:19:35,488 --> 00:19:37,022
Tony was telling me about it
the other day.

260
00:19:37,023 --> 00:19:39,824
It's a mask of some sort.
I mean, it's worth a lot of money.

261
00:19:39,825 --> 00:19:42,876
All right, so
I'll get you guys your money.

262
00:19:43,095 --> 00:19:46,544
In good faith,
I'll let Cujo back there take a shot.

263
00:19:49,735 --> 00:19:52,945
You, Bannen, you got yourself one week.

264
00:19:55,308 --> 00:19:56,857
Francis.

265
00:20:02,415 --> 00:20:04,658
Nice. So we're good, right?

266
00:20:15,361 --> 00:20:17,172
Uncle B was right.

267
00:20:19,098 --> 00:20:21,113
I don't have a choice.

268
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:25,242
You've got a choice. Grow up or give up.

269
00:20:27,807 --> 00:20:29,686
That's your advice?

270
00:20:30,242 --> 00:20:33,327
I thought you were supposed
to be supportive.

271
00:20:34,714 --> 00:20:37,958
I guess next time
I'll just ask God for advice.

272
00:20:39,085 --> 00:20:42,568
God's a little busy to worry about you.

273
00:20:44,023 --> 00:20:47,267
You gotta believe in yourself.
Go with your gut.

274
00:20:48,627 --> 00:20:53,339
And don't take all of this too seriously,
'cause it'll bite you in the ass.

275
00:20:57,970 --> 00:20:59,519
Thanks, Mom.

276
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,517
You always know what to say.

277
00:21:45,618 --> 00:21:49,135
Are you aware that breaking and entering
is a felony?

278
00:21:53,626 --> 00:21:57,610
The use of a gun
can increase the sentence to state prison.

279
00:21:58,397 --> 00:22:02,677
Well, I'll be sure to only use it
in self-defense, then.

280
00:22:05,271 --> 00:22:09,721
Based on what I've seen,
I think you could use a bodyguard.

281
00:22:11,043 --> 00:22:13,878
Unless you're applying for the job,
I'll assume you're stalking me,

282
00:22:13,879 --> 00:22:16,759
which gives me quite a case against you.

283
00:22:17,249 --> 00:22:21,130
Oh, no, actually, I just dropped by
to give this back to you.

284
00:22:21,287 --> 00:22:25,134
I was mildly impressed.
No one has ever lifted from me before.

285
00:22:25,157 --> 00:22:27,759
I kept your Starbucks card for my trouble.

286
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:31,830
Sure. Press charges,
break the code of thieves

287
00:22:31,831 --> 00:22:34,848
and, yeah, have my Starbucks card.

288
00:22:39,004 --> 00:22:41,506
Did you just say "code of thieves"?

289
00:22:41,507 --> 00:22:44,476
You highly overestimate your charm,

290
00:22:44,477 --> 00:22:48,154
and you're definitely underestimating
my trigger finger,

291
00:22:48,614 --> 00:22:53,633
- so I feel like I should sneak out now.
- Without hearing my business proposition?

292
00:22:55,354 --> 00:22:59,491
Your business proposition? See, I was
thinking maybe you were tracking me

293
00:22:59,492 --> 00:23:02,236
because you find me attractive,

294
00:23:02,595 --> 00:23:06,841
but clearly you're just using me
for my more roguish qualities.

295
00:23:09,201 --> 00:23:12,149
A deft hand can be very attractive.

296
00:23:15,841 --> 00:23:18,843
I feel like I should tell you things
about myself,

297
00:23:18,844 --> 00:23:23,727
like I never commit to anyone
or anything, ever. I have trust issues.

298
00:23:24,717 --> 00:23:26,835
My daddy didn't love me.

299
00:23:27,186 --> 00:23:31,656
If you want to offer me a job, you should
make it the best damn offer possible

300
00:23:31,657 --> 00:23:35,868
because, Mr. Bannen, no matter
how enchanting you think you are,

301
00:23:36,595 --> 00:23:37,929
people get one chance with me,

302
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:41,811
and if you screw up that chance,
you may never see me again.

303
00:23:43,969 --> 00:23:45,503
Face-to-face, anyway.

304
00:23:45,504 --> 00:23:48,673
The job is to steal something
that means a lot to one scumbag

305
00:23:48,674 --> 00:23:51,042
and deliver it to another scumbag.

306
00:23:51,043 --> 00:23:54,629
Your salary for this job
is a couple hundred thousand,

307
00:23:54,747 --> 00:23:57,015
and it may or may not include benefits.

308
00:23:57,016 --> 00:23:59,250
And it's gonna be very dangerous,
I'm not gonna lie,

309
00:23:59,251 --> 00:24:03,804
not to somebody like you.
You'd sniff that out 100 yards away.

310
00:24:12,398 --> 00:24:16,985
My fee is actually 500 grand, but that
doesn't mean I'm gonna do the job.

311
00:24:17,202 --> 00:24:20,981
Spoken like a true pro.
That was straight out of the book.

312
00:24:21,373 --> 00:24:23,923
Whatever you pledge allegiance to
owns you.

313
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:35,627
Lesson learned.

314
00:24:44,597 --> 00:24:46,715
How's your father doing?

315
00:24:47,066 --> 00:24:51,346
He doesn't know I'm working for you again,
if that's what you mean.

316
00:24:52,237 --> 00:24:56,084
- You haven't seen him?
- No, why?

317
00:24:58,844 --> 00:25:00,621
He's watching me.

318
00:25:03,916 --> 00:25:06,899
I hope for his sake he keeps his distance.

319
00:25:08,454 --> 00:25:12,335
Not to worry, though.
Your allegiance is in the right place.

320
00:25:20,132 --> 00:25:21,610
I can't even open
this frigging thing.

321
00:25:22,761 --> 00:25:25,470
It's supposed to have
the Turin Shroud in it.

322
00:25:25,471 --> 00:25:29,516
You know that... that summate
Jesus was buried with?

323
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:34,821
Could someone please open
this fucking box for me?

324
00:25:37,449 --> 00:25:42,366
What is that? Wait, wait. What is that?
A frigging power tool?

325
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:46,591
Have you ever heard of the Sabbath?

326
00:25:46,592 --> 00:25:50,701
Have you ever heard of a Jew?
Do you know what a Jew is, Mr. Shnook?

327
00:25:52,164 --> 00:25:58,302
Today is Saturday. It's the Sabbath.
You can't use electricity on the Sabbath.

328
00:25:58,303 --> 00:26:01,217
How was I to know? Look, I'm sorry.

329
00:26:01,407 --> 00:26:04,355
Power tool. You're a shmuck, Shnook.

330
00:26:06,311 --> 00:26:07,553
What?

331
00:26:08,514 --> 00:26:12,760
Mr. B is sending somebody over
for the box.

332
00:26:16,021 --> 00:26:17,866
Find him. I want him dead!

333
00:26:26,632 --> 00:26:28,875
You didn't have to sleep in my car.

334
00:26:29,835 --> 00:26:33,887
So I'm gonna take this job
on one condition. I call the shots.

335
00:26:34,106 --> 00:26:35,280
No.

336
00:26:37,843 --> 00:26:42,396
There's Zeke. He's my right-hand man.
Hey, buddy, you ready for prep day?

337
00:26:42,414 --> 00:26:46,762
So ready. I just took the biggest deuce
you've ever seen.

338
00:26:47,453 --> 00:26:51,835
I feel, like, five pounds lighter.
I almost sent you a picture of it.

339
00:26:51,957 --> 00:26:55,326
Zeke, you're in the car with Madison,
the one I was telling you about.

340
00:26:55,327 --> 00:27:00,039
- She's kindly gonna help us on this job.
- We'll always have this moment, Zeke.

341
00:27:00,566 --> 00:27:06,003
Nice to meet you, too, Madison.
Okay, on to more pressing matters.

342
00:27:06,004 --> 00:27:12,343
Apparently, The Mensch has found out
that Mr. B sent you after the box

343
00:27:12,344 --> 00:27:15,952
and has hired an assassin trio
for protection.

344
00:27:16,148 --> 00:27:20,485
These are the hottest assassins
I have ever seen.

345
00:27:20,486 --> 00:27:23,605
- Perfect.
- The first one I call Jailbait.

346
00:27:24,323 --> 00:27:28,226
I believe she's in her 20s,
but she says she's 17,

347
00:27:28,227 --> 00:27:31,540
because perverts seem to get off
on that kind of thing.

348
00:27:31,930 --> 00:27:34,105
She seduces her victims,

349
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,675
she lets them have their way with her,

350
00:27:38,704 --> 00:27:41,254
she waits for the opportune time,

351
00:27:42,107 --> 00:27:45,749
and then she stabs them
with a horse tranquilizer.

352
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:50,455
I'm not even gonna get into
what she does after that.

353
00:27:54,153 --> 00:27:57,363
And then the next one is
former special ops,

354
00:27:58,457 --> 00:28:03,635
trained in acrobatics,
martial arts and espionage.

355
00:28:06,865 --> 00:28:08,812
And she loves knives.

356
00:28:14,439 --> 00:28:17,558
I call her Stiletto.

357
00:28:18,577 --> 00:28:22,480
And last, but certainly not least,
the one I named Bombshell.

358
00:28:22,481 --> 00:28:26,658
Really not much to say about Bombshell.
She's hot, she's blonde,

359
00:28:27,019 --> 00:28:29,194
she likes to blow shit up.

360
00:28:33,759 --> 00:28:38,710
Bannen, listen to me. I'm sending you
the images. Look at them this time, okay?

361
00:28:39,431 --> 00:28:41,065
Why is that funny?

362
00:28:41,066 --> 00:28:44,379
There's no such thing
as a trio of hot assassins.

363
00:28:45,037 --> 00:28:47,485
In my wildest fantasies, maybe.

364
00:28:54,279 --> 00:28:56,080
- I'm saying let me drive once.
- No.

365
00:28:56,081 --> 00:28:59,684
You don't know how to drive your own car.
What are we... What are we doing?

366
00:28:59,685 --> 00:29:02,929
We have to go see my uncle
before we do the job.

367
00:29:03,121 --> 00:29:06,257
I'm sorry. We have to make a quick stop
to see your mob uncle?

368
00:29:06,258 --> 00:29:07,425
There are certain people, Bannen,

369
00:29:07,426 --> 00:29:10,027
who I would like to remain anonymous to,
like everyone.

370
00:29:10,028 --> 00:29:11,627
He's the one paying the bills
right now, so...

371
00:29:11,628 --> 00:29:13,497
Wait a second,
I just realized,

372
00:29:13,498 --> 00:29:14,966
- after I pay Sonny and his guys...
- Who's that?

373
00:29:14,967 --> 00:29:16,033
- and Zeke gets his cut...
- Bannen!

374
00:29:16,034 --> 00:29:17,919
and then you get your cut,
I'm left with nothing.

375
00:29:20,939 --> 00:29:23,614
Bannen! Always good to see you, bud.

376
00:29:23,909 --> 00:29:25,810
I know we told you we were gonna give you
a little more time,

377
00:29:25,811 --> 00:29:28,452
but sorry, man, you were summoned.

378
00:29:39,291 --> 00:29:42,740
- Who in the fuck is this pretty boy?
- It's Neal Bannen.

379
00:29:44,897 --> 00:29:47,447
- No, it's not.
- What do you mean?

380
00:29:48,367 --> 00:29:52,283
What do you mean what do I mean?
This ain't Neal Bannen.

381
00:29:52,404 --> 00:29:56,991
All due respect, Sonny, we've been
trailing that piece of shit for weeks.

382
00:29:57,109 --> 00:30:01,779
With all due respect,
I'm telling you, this ain't Neal Bannen,

383
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:06,094
because Neal Bannen swore he was gonna
have my fucking money by now.

384
00:30:26,972 --> 00:30:29,886
Can we talk as two cutty macks?

385
00:30:33,979 --> 00:30:36,996
I could've sworn you owed me 150 G's, huh?

386
00:30:40,619 --> 00:30:44,296
But every time my gentlemen
catch up with you,

387
00:30:45,223 --> 00:30:47,000
you have nothing.

388
00:30:48,593 --> 00:30:50,628
Now I ain't never been no college cat.

389
00:30:50,629 --> 00:30:55,079
I mean, my teachers was macks,
hustlers, pimps.

390
00:30:56,134 --> 00:30:58,878
You see, I didn't use a pen or a pad.

391
00:30:59,538 --> 00:31:02,919
I used three-card Marley, loaded dice,

392
00:31:06,178 --> 00:31:07,920
and loaded guns.

393
00:31:09,147 --> 00:31:11,788
I think I get where you're going...

394
00:31:13,185 --> 00:31:16,566
Now, I want to ask you,
do you hold grudges?

395
00:31:19,024 --> 00:31:20,641
Because I do.

396
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:25,469
When I hold on to a grudge for too long,
man, I start to see red,

397
00:31:27,199 --> 00:31:31,149
and then there's only one thing
that keeps me out of the red.

398
00:31:34,039 --> 00:31:35,247
Box!

399
00:31:57,062 --> 00:32:01,273
And then I'm nice and smooth again.
Then I start to remind myself,

400
00:32:01,733 --> 00:32:06,877
"Isn't Neal Bannen retrieving
some sort of valuable box for Mr. B?"

401
00:32:07,005 --> 00:32:08,573
He is. He totally is!

402
00:32:08,574 --> 00:32:10,173
And I hear that it's got a set
of these thick,

403
00:32:10,174 --> 00:32:12,243
flawless diamonds inside of it.

404
00:32:12,244 --> 00:32:15,625
- Isn't that right?
- I heard an antique mask.

405
00:32:16,181 --> 00:32:17,628
Diamonds!

406
00:32:22,054 --> 00:32:25,469
Then it's clear to me.
Instead of taking the money,

407
00:32:28,393 --> 00:32:30,977
I'll take the box. You dig?

408
00:32:32,064 --> 00:32:33,704
- ¡Papi!
- I dig.

409
00:32:34,266 --> 00:32:36,748
You're playing my favorite song.

410
00:33:07,566 --> 00:33:09,115
Neal Bannen?

411
00:33:13,605 --> 00:33:17,589
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Mami, you two know each other?

412
00:33:19,177 --> 00:33:21,420
Come on, Papi, let's dance.

413
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:43,512
Catalina.

414
00:33:47,606 --> 00:33:51,021
Normally I would kill a man
for crossing that line,

415
00:33:51,209 --> 00:33:54,920
but we agreed,
you're gonna bring me the box,

416
00:33:55,614 --> 00:33:57,493
so I can't do that.

417
00:34:06,558 --> 00:34:09,973
I see you brought
your little lady friend with you.

418
00:34:16,768 --> 00:34:19,512
I think I found a way to reciprocate.

419
00:34:22,174 --> 00:34:24,542
- Okay.
- Okay, ya pues.

420
00:34:24,543 --> 00:34:28,288
What are you doing?
Sonny, what are you doing?

421
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:45,138
You know, you're right, Sonny.
I did sleep with your girl.

422
00:34:45,897 --> 00:34:48,845
Before you guys were together, of course.

423
00:34:49,801 --> 00:34:52,770
It's only fair, though,
that you have your way with her.

424
00:34:52,771 --> 00:34:54,013
What?

425
00:34:54,306 --> 00:34:56,707
Okay, you know what, Sonny?
Come on. Come on! Stop!

426
00:34:56,708 --> 00:34:59,986
- What are you doing?
- Come on. Come on. Come on.

427
00:35:05,617 --> 00:35:10,261
I should probably warn you, though,
as a cutty, she may not be very clean.

428
00:35:11,256 --> 00:35:14,858
I mean, when a girl sleeps
with as many guys as she does,

429
00:35:14,859 --> 00:35:17,239
she's bound to have something.

430
00:35:17,762 --> 00:35:19,830
Are you saying
you brought a hooker up in here?

431
00:35:19,831 --> 00:35:23,200
I didn't know she was a prostitute
when I first met her.

432
00:35:23,201 --> 00:35:24,864
When I picked her up
for our little date,

433
00:35:24,865 --> 00:35:28,639
first thing she said was:
"5 dollars for a handjob".

434
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,841
I mean, I should've known.
Look at the way she's dressed,

435
00:35:30,842 --> 00:35:32,857
those "fuck me" boots.

436
00:35:35,313 --> 00:35:38,899
- Mami, is he telling the truth?
- I'm not a prostitute.

437
00:35:40,018 --> 00:35:42,161
I'm a high-class call girl.

438
00:35:45,123 --> 00:35:47,698
And I'm 50 dollars
for a handjob.

439
00:35:50,095 --> 00:35:51,503
50 dollars.

440
00:36:23,962 --> 00:36:26,842
Thanks for looking out for a cutty, man.

441
00:36:36,341 --> 00:36:37,651
Jesus!

442
00:36:41,646 --> 00:36:43,263
Thanks, guys.

443
00:36:46,251 --> 00:36:50,531
- I think I'm falling in love.
- Don't. I'll only hurt you.

444
00:36:57,829 --> 00:37:00,072
Are you two ready for this?

445
00:37:00,999 --> 00:37:03,379
We'll have the box by tonight.

446
00:37:19,517 --> 00:37:20,759
Neal?

447
00:37:33,298 --> 00:37:37,077
Just so you know,
Manni doesn't work for me anymore.

448
00:37:39,471 --> 00:37:41,919
From now on it's Dimitri or me.

449
00:37:48,446 --> 00:37:50,359
You trust this girl?

450
00:37:52,584 --> 00:37:54,258
Why wouldn't I?

451
00:37:55,487 --> 00:38:00,301
All right.
Word to the wise from your favorite uncle.

452
00:38:03,361 --> 00:38:05,240
Don't fuck this up.

453
00:38:07,732 --> 00:38:09,645
No turning back now.

454
00:38:11,636 --> 00:38:14,050
Hey, B, we just got the invite.

455
00:38:15,807 --> 00:38:19,688
- You going over the guest list?
- Yeah, I think I got my guy.

456
00:38:20,278 --> 00:38:23,781
All right, while you're doing that,
we'll finish the replica box.

457
00:38:23,782 --> 00:38:27,129
All right.
I'll tie up the rest of the loose ends.

458
00:38:31,523 --> 00:38:33,300
Replica complete.

459
00:38:34,325 --> 00:38:35,926
All right,
let's make sure we're on the same page.

460
00:38:35,927 --> 00:38:38,128
I'm going to arrive as J.C. Trilby.

461
00:38:38,129 --> 00:38:41,373
- I'll already be there.
- And I'll mingle for a bit.

462
00:38:41,699 --> 00:38:43,867
Before you meet up,
you both need to mark each of the guards

463
00:38:43,868 --> 00:38:47,818
with transponders so I can track them.
There's eight of them.

464
00:38:48,373 --> 00:38:50,753
And I'm gonna mark The Mensch.

465
00:38:51,409 --> 00:38:54,119
- We meet up and flirt for a while.
- Yeah.

466
00:38:54,379 --> 00:38:56,613
By that time,
everyone should be nice and toasty,

467
00:38:56,614 --> 00:38:58,182
so you can head to one of the rooms.

468
00:38:58,183 --> 00:39:00,551
The Mensch's private room
should be guarded.

469
00:39:00,552 --> 00:39:03,754
- Go to the next room over.
- I'll hand you the replica.

470
00:39:03,755 --> 00:39:06,390
Bannen will make his way
through The Mensch's secret doorway

471
00:39:06,391 --> 00:39:08,025
to get to his private room.

472
00:39:08,026 --> 00:39:10,227
The box should be hidden
in a hollowed bust.

473
00:39:10,228 --> 00:39:13,472
Switch it out with the replica
and you're good.

474
00:39:21,873 --> 00:39:25,925
Wait, wait, B, you never told me how
you're gonna pose as J.C. Trilby.

475
00:39:26,945 --> 00:39:29,325
I can't reveal all my secrets.

476
00:39:30,949 --> 00:39:34,284
Hey, Madison should be on the rooftop.
She couldn't wait.

477
00:39:34,285 --> 00:39:37,962
She marked all the guards.
She only has The Mensch left.

478
00:39:40,525 --> 00:39:42,074
Let's party.

479
00:39:44,429 --> 00:39:46,830
Okay, Madison,
just get him interested in you,

480
00:39:46,831 --> 00:39:50,109
but don't be too aggressive.
You don't wanna scare him off.

481
00:39:50,335 --> 00:39:53,579
- Hello.
- I've been eyeing you all night.

482
00:39:54,239 --> 00:39:57,586
Okay, change of plans. Just go for it.

483
00:40:04,983 --> 00:40:08,364
- It's so nice to finally meet The Mensch.
- I know.

484
00:40:08,987 --> 00:40:11,935
Okay, find your opportunity and mark him.

485
00:40:32,844 --> 00:40:34,928
That sounded just nasty.

486
00:40:35,713 --> 00:40:36,921
We are in.

487
00:40:43,388 --> 00:40:46,735
All right, Madison,
make your way over to the bar.

488
00:40:47,759 --> 00:40:51,395
- Let's get this over with.
- Bannen will pick you up there.

489
00:40:51,396 --> 00:40:53,571
Making my move on Madison.

490
00:40:55,967 --> 00:40:57,709
Fuck off, bitch!

491
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:04,575
You will make a fine wife.

492
00:41:04,576 --> 00:41:07,786
Why don't we go inside
and we make it official?

493
00:41:07,946 --> 00:41:10,087
How are you still single?

494
00:41:11,482 --> 00:41:16,331
- We got to make this believable.
- How do you propose we do that?

495
00:41:26,130 --> 00:41:28,908
Okay, but just to make it believable.

496
00:41:31,803 --> 00:41:36,473
Hey, hey, hey.
How you doing, huh? Mister...

497
00:41:36,474 --> 00:41:39,509
- Trilby. J.C. Trilby. Yes. Yes.
- Trilby, Trilby.

498
00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:43,513
That's great. You know, I think,
Mr. Trilby, you better beat it.

499
00:41:43,514 --> 00:41:45,529
This one's mine, okay?

500
00:41:49,153 --> 00:41:52,456
Looks like The Mensch might be in love.
I think she's got him.

501
00:41:52,457 --> 00:41:55,192
- What's going on?
- We're about to find out.

502
00:41:55,193 --> 00:41:57,607
How could you still be single?

503
00:41:58,363 --> 00:42:00,913
Maybe you should come to my room.

504
00:42:01,432 --> 00:42:06,610
I'll suck your fingers,
I'll suck your toes, and then you can...

505
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,057
suck mine.

506
00:42:11,809 --> 00:42:15,417
Hey, go with it.
He's gonna lead you right to the box.

507
00:42:15,446 --> 00:42:18,030
- Let's go.
- Come on.

508
00:42:21,319 --> 00:42:23,186
You may not be needed, Bannen.

509
00:42:23,187 --> 00:42:26,657
What do you say we check out
one of those private rooms?

510
00:42:26,658 --> 00:42:27,900
Sure.

511
00:42:32,296 --> 00:42:34,880
Hey, you want to join us? Come on.

512
00:42:44,709 --> 00:42:47,411
Okay, Madison,
the box should be in the corner...

513
00:42:47,412 --> 00:42:49,029
Not bad, huh?

514
00:42:50,314 --> 00:42:52,329
...under a hollowed bust.

515
00:42:54,252 --> 00:42:56,199
Do what you gotta do.

516
00:43:01,292 --> 00:43:06,175
- Why is... What's he doing here?
- This is Mr. Shnook.

517
00:43:08,733 --> 00:43:12,182
He's privy to all my business.
He's fine. He's good.

518
00:43:19,077 --> 00:43:21,354
I think we should do it now.

519
00:43:22,213 --> 00:43:25,127
Come here. Could you just...
Could you just...

520
00:43:26,818 --> 00:43:29,801
The things that I would like to do to you,

521
00:43:29,854 --> 00:43:32,996
I don't think you're gonna
want Shnook to see.

522
00:43:40,598 --> 00:43:43,774
Mr. Shnook, please leave the room.

523
00:43:45,069 --> 00:43:47,414
And lock the door behind you.

524
00:43:50,041 --> 00:43:52,125
Beat it! Pervert!

525
00:44:01,519 --> 00:44:04,604
Why don't you guys
make yourself comfortable?

526
00:44:04,655 --> 00:44:07,103
You know, entertain each other.

527
00:44:08,126 --> 00:44:11,473
- What the hell is going on with Madison?
- Hold on.

528
00:44:12,230 --> 00:44:13,897
- She's not responding.
- What do you mean?

529
00:44:13,898 --> 00:44:16,448
Madison? Madison, do you read me?

530
00:44:17,935 --> 00:44:19,169
What?

531
00:44:19,170 --> 00:44:20,871
- She's gone.
- What do you mean "she's gone"?

532
00:44:20,872 --> 00:44:22,172
She just disappeared.

533
00:44:22,173 --> 00:44:26,176
She's completely off the radar
and The Mensch isn't moving at all.

534
00:44:26,177 --> 00:44:29,728
What the fuck is going on?
I'm going in there.

535
00:44:30,348 --> 00:44:32,125
I'm gonna just...

536
00:44:34,819 --> 00:44:36,219
I'll be right back.

537
00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:39,203
You guys just keep doing
what you're doing.

538
00:44:46,798 --> 00:44:49,246
God, I could marry both of you.

539
00:44:52,570 --> 00:44:56,087
This is spooky, B. Be careful.
Something's not right.

540
00:45:03,915 --> 00:45:05,589
Where'd she go?

541
00:45:07,185 --> 00:45:09,428
Trilby, thank God it's you.

542
00:45:11,088 --> 00:45:13,229
That sock was disgusting.

543
00:45:14,959 --> 00:45:18,943
- Tell me where she went!
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute!

544
00:45:19,397 --> 00:45:23,039
You're not J.C. Trilby.
You're that prick Bannen!

545
00:45:24,368 --> 00:45:26,383
Shit, Bannen, get out!

546
00:45:26,637 --> 00:45:28,638
- You're after the fucking box, right?
- Go to the window.

547
00:45:28,639 --> 00:45:32,987
You fucker! Shnook!
Get your fucking ass in here!

548
00:45:33,811 --> 00:45:35,155
Shnook!

549
00:45:35,713 --> 00:45:36,980
- What's happening, B?
- Shnook!

550
00:45:36,981 --> 00:45:38,009
- I'm in the dark here, B.
- Get in here! Shnook!

551
00:45:38,010 --> 00:45:39,683
What's going on?

552
00:45:39,684 --> 00:45:42,667
What are you doing, B?
You're surrounded. Get out of there!

553
00:45:51,863 --> 00:45:53,997
It wasn't until precisely this moment

554
00:45:53,998 --> 00:45:57,208
that I believed the assassin trio
even existed.

555
00:45:58,135 --> 00:46:00,014
I hate being wrong.

556
00:46:04,609 --> 00:46:08,211
Finally, finally,
the assassin has arrived.

557
00:46:08,212 --> 00:46:11,854
You're dead, Bannen. You're dead!

558
00:46:12,216 --> 00:46:15,719
I want you to fucking cut him
into little pieces.

559
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:18,430
I want you to slice his liver!

560
00:46:29,233 --> 00:46:33,251
Go, go, go, go, go. Go! Come on, hurry!
Come on! Come on!

561
00:46:55,026 --> 00:46:58,528
- Bannen, what is happening?
- Zeke, Madison has the box.

562
00:46:58,529 --> 00:46:59,763
She's off the radar, Bannen.

563
00:46:59,764 --> 00:47:02,866
She turned off her cell phone,
I can't find her on the satellite.

564
00:47:02,867 --> 00:47:06,002
I can't call Mr. B and tell him I lost it.
You gotta find her. Just find her!

565
00:47:06,003 --> 00:47:08,022
So what are you gonna do?

566
00:47:28,092 --> 00:47:32,338
- Sorry, is this iced tea?
- Yeah, Long Island.

567
00:47:32,530 --> 00:47:33,772
Wait.

568
00:47:40,137 --> 00:47:41,271
Happy holidays.

569
00:47:41,272 --> 00:47:44,207
Okay, gentlemen, a big round of applause
for Tammy, everybody. Tammy.

570
00:47:44,208 --> 00:47:46,142
All right, gentlemen,
tonight is amateur night.

571
00:47:46,143 --> 00:47:48,678
Some lucky lady is gonna walk out of here
with 500 bucks. Any takers?

572
00:47:48,679 --> 00:47:52,082
$500, ladies, $500.
Easy money, easy money, easy money.

573
00:47:52,083 --> 00:47:55,585
Come on, $500. Come onto the stage.
Amateur ladies, report to the stage.

574
00:47:55,586 --> 00:47:59,322
Going once, going twice... Whoa!
Okay, who do we have here?

575
00:47:59,323 --> 00:48:00,790
Wait a second. Hold on a second.

576
00:48:00,791 --> 00:48:04,794
Steve? Steve? You sure this girl’s
the legal age for this club?

577
00:48:04,795 --> 00:48:06,242
Let's not waste any more time, then.

578
00:48:43,567 --> 00:48:45,480
Yeah! Well...

579
00:48:46,270 --> 00:48:50,686
I think this little lady's got quite
a future, what do you guys think?

580
00:48:58,916 --> 00:49:01,466
I thought this was amateur night.

581
00:49:02,586 --> 00:49:05,637
Something tells me
you're not what you seem.

582
00:49:06,757 --> 00:49:08,807
How old are you really?

583
00:49:10,227 --> 00:49:13,642
- Old enough.
- Are you sure?

584
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:19,636
Quick lesson.
You want someone to do what you want,

585
00:49:19,637 --> 00:49:21,880
you need to choose the options for them.

586
00:49:25,476 --> 00:49:29,245
I especially like to use this principle
when picking up women.

587
00:49:29,246 --> 00:49:30,920
I have an idea.

588
00:49:32,817 --> 00:49:36,064
Why don't...
we go back to your place...

589
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:38,905
and you can find out
how old I really am?

590
00:49:38,956 --> 00:49:41,524
But this time,
it was being used on me.

591
00:49:41,525 --> 00:49:43,436
Or...

592
00:49:43,887 --> 00:49:47,637
we can go to a motel and you can do
whatever you want to me.

593
00:49:50,201 --> 00:49:52,012
And I didn't care.

594
00:50:13,858 --> 00:50:17,127
Zeke, dude, have you seen two girls
and a bullwhip?

595
00:50:17,128 --> 00:50:18,862
- No, I have no wish to...
- Check this out.

596
00:50:18,863 --> 00:50:20,463
- Look, look. Watch, watch, watch.
- Get off my computer.

597
00:50:20,464 --> 00:50:22,946
- Just look it.
- Don't touch that.

598
00:50:23,868 --> 00:50:27,613
- What did you just hit?
- Here we go again.

599
00:50:34,912 --> 00:50:37,656
Hey, guys! Guys, come check this out.

600
00:50:38,949 --> 00:50:41,017
- That's Jailbait.
- Yeah, she is.

601
00:50:41,018 --> 00:50:44,262
No, you don't... Hold on. Bannen? Bannen?

602
00:50:44,655 --> 00:50:48,571
Can you hear me? Can you hear me?
No, no, no, no.

603
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:51,671
She's gonna kill him, okay?
That's what she does.

604
00:50:59,336 --> 00:51:00,578
Okay.

605
00:51:01,872 --> 00:51:05,074
She's gonna stab him and she's
gonna cut off his balls. All right?

606
00:51:05,075 --> 00:51:06,817
Bannen! Wake up!

607
00:51:12,550 --> 00:51:16,431
Okay, this might...
Oh, God, please work, please work.

608
00:51:18,756 --> 00:51:20,271
Okay. Okay.

609
00:51:20,658 --> 00:51:25,108
Bannen, Jailbait's trying to kill you!

610
00:51:28,933 --> 00:51:33,417
- What? What?
- She is going to cut off your balls!

611
00:51:33,737 --> 00:51:36,082
Jailbait's trying to kill me?

612
00:51:55,793 --> 00:52:00,971
For the record, I helped you save him.
You tell him that.

613
00:52:04,101 --> 00:52:06,620
You tell him what I did here today.

614
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:12,875
Hey, B, I found Madison, all right?
She turned her phone back on.

615
00:52:12,876 --> 00:52:16,346
- Where is she?
- I traced her call to a guy named Marcel.

616
00:52:16,347 --> 00:52:20,763
- Send me her location. I'll get her.
- Keep your eye out for Bombshell.

617
00:52:24,822 --> 00:52:26,356
- Hey.
- I am so sorry.

618
00:52:26,357 --> 00:52:29,392
That is so weird, 'cause I was
just looking for you at the party.

619
00:52:29,393 --> 00:52:33,673
Right, because I had to slip out.

620
00:52:33,964 --> 00:52:36,933
- I missed you.
- Yeah, I wanted to say goodbye

621
00:52:36,934 --> 00:52:39,569
and I said, "Fuck it,
I'm just gonna jump out the window. "

622
00:52:39,570 --> 00:52:41,471
- Yeah. I wanted to say bye to you.
- No, that was you.

623
00:52:41,472 --> 00:52:44,250
- I have to go.
- Wait, wait, wait.

624
00:52:45,342 --> 00:52:48,791
Can't we just have, like,
one straightforward conversation?

625
00:53:38,128 --> 00:53:40,863
- Give up yet?
- Give me the box.

626
00:53:40,864 --> 00:53:43,733
You want the box? Hey, you know what?
I have an offer for you.

627
00:53:43,734 --> 00:53:47,615
I know a guy. He's actually interested
in purchasing my box.

628
00:53:47,805 --> 00:53:51,174
He's got a new connection in France,
so we can split the profits 80I20.

629
00:53:51,175 --> 00:53:56,579
- Let me guess, you get 80, I get 20.
- Yes, genius. All right, 70I30.

630
00:53:56,580 --> 00:53:58,848
Yeah, I'm not here to make a deal
with you, all right?

631
00:53:58,849 --> 00:54:02,285
Okay, 60I40. That's my last offer.

632
00:54:02,286 --> 00:54:05,154
I'm the only one who knows
how to get a hold of Marcel.

633
00:54:05,155 --> 00:54:06,789
Now think about it, Bannen.

634
00:54:06,790 --> 00:54:11,536
I don't need you or your contact,
I just need the box, so just hand it over.

635
00:54:12,229 --> 00:54:15,712
Okay, you're right. You don't need me.

636
00:54:16,533 --> 00:54:19,083
I guess I'm out of options, so...

637
00:54:21,672 --> 00:54:23,221
Come get it.

638
00:54:36,887 --> 00:54:40,234
Wow.

639
00:54:40,924 --> 00:54:42,325
Holy shit.

640
00:54:42,326 --> 00:54:44,910
- That was nice.
- That's pretty far.

641
00:54:47,798 --> 00:54:51,213
I really, really wish
you wouldn't make me do this.

642
00:54:52,770 --> 00:54:54,649
I think I like you.

643
00:54:56,039 --> 00:54:57,573
Let me tell you what's gonna happen.

644
00:54:57,574 --> 00:54:59,351
- Okay.
- All right?

645
00:54:59,376 --> 00:55:02,893
I'm gonna walk over
and you're gonna hand me the box.

646
00:55:03,981 --> 00:55:07,183
I'm gonna walk away
and I'm gonna give it to Mr. B,

647
00:55:07,184 --> 00:55:10,599
who's gonna pay me my money
so I can pay off Sonny.

648
00:55:10,721 --> 00:55:15,205
You want to shoot me sometime in between,
so be it,

649
00:55:17,428 --> 00:55:19,773
'cause I don't have a choice.

650
00:55:44,655 --> 00:55:46,295
Okay, 50I50.

651
00:56:26,997 --> 00:56:28,764
Stay away from him.

652
00:56:28,765 --> 00:56:31,907
I wish I could see your face
when it happens.

653
00:56:32,135 --> 00:56:37,120
If I see your blonde fucking
bimbo weave again, I will end you.

654
00:56:45,148 --> 00:56:47,789
What am I supposed to do with this?

655
00:56:49,152 --> 00:56:53,261
Return to Mr. B
and then turn states on him?

656
00:56:53,924 --> 00:56:55,541
He'd kill me.

657
00:56:56,793 --> 00:56:59,002
If I don't, I go to jail.

658
00:57:00,998 --> 00:57:02,965
And the fucked up thing
is all I can think about

659
00:57:02,966 --> 00:57:06,847
- is that drink at the strip club.
- Well, you made a mistake.

660
00:57:07,571 --> 00:57:10,781
At some point,
you got to let it go and move on.

661
00:57:11,675 --> 00:57:15,022
Little voices in your head,
those instinct voices,

662
00:57:15,612 --> 00:57:18,094
- what are they telling you?
- Run.

663
00:57:20,017 --> 00:57:24,035
Spoken like a true hero.
That's how I know I raised you right.

664
00:57:25,622 --> 00:57:28,206
The only advice I can give you is

665
00:57:28,759 --> 00:57:32,174
trust that whatever you decide
is the right choice.

666
00:57:33,697 --> 00:57:36,475
Whatever I decide is the right choice.

667
00:57:46,743 --> 00:57:48,793
Uncle B, I got the box.

668
00:57:49,546 --> 00:57:53,249
I knew I could count on you.
We'll meet in the afternoon.

669
00:57:53,250 --> 00:57:56,836
I got a warehouse in the fishing district.
Come alone.

670
00:58:00,223 --> 00:58:03,225
Wait, Manni's been a cop
the whole fucking time?

671
00:58:03,226 --> 00:58:04,327
Yep.

672
00:58:04,328 --> 00:58:07,129
What the hell are they gonna do with me
if they find out I'm wearing a wire?

673
00:58:07,130 --> 00:58:10,579
Probably shoot you. I'm kidding.
It's gonna be fine.

674
00:58:10,767 --> 00:58:14,003
All you gotta do is make sure
that you get in there and deliver the box

675
00:58:14,004 --> 00:58:15,338
and get him talking.

676
00:58:15,339 --> 00:58:17,640
Okay? If anything goes wrong,
and I'm sure it won't,

677
00:58:17,641 --> 00:58:20,776
- we'll cut the lights and move in.
- Anything happens, you hit the floor.

678
00:58:20,777 --> 00:58:25,091
- Let us be your guardian angel.
- I thought that was Mom's role.

679
00:58:26,783 --> 00:58:29,333
What would she think of all this?

680
00:58:32,389 --> 00:58:35,269
All set. All right, let's rock and roll.

681
00:58:38,662 --> 00:58:41,964
This is fucking bullshit, Zeke.
I'm doing the biggest drop-off of my life

682
00:58:41,965 --> 00:58:44,000
and you're not even there
to wish me good luck?

683
00:58:44,001 --> 00:58:47,587
Whatever, dude. Fuck off.
I'll call you later.

684
00:58:53,176 --> 00:58:56,345
All right, you're gonna waltz in
as your charming self.

685
00:58:56,346 --> 00:58:57,680
Everything is normal.

686
00:58:57,681 --> 00:59:00,016
Sure, just doing a drop-off
to my mob uncle,

687
00:59:00,017 --> 00:59:03,352
who I'm about to rat out
in front of his armed henchmen.

688
00:59:03,353 --> 00:59:08,791
- You know, typical day for Neal Bannen.
- Or you can go to jail. Choice is yours.

689
00:59:08,792 --> 00:59:12,378
Unit A arriving and getting into position.
Let's move.

690
00:59:21,438 --> 00:59:23,988
You're gonna frisk my own nephew?

691
00:59:26,009 --> 00:59:28,218
If I know Neal, he didn't bring the gun.

692
00:59:30,247 --> 00:59:34,925
He's not wearing a wire.
Why would he be wearing a wire?

693
00:59:38,388 --> 00:59:41,029
You're not wearing a wire, are you?

694
00:59:43,460 --> 00:59:47,068
All right, boys, grab him,
tie him up, slit his throat.

695
00:59:47,597 --> 00:59:49,265
And then we're gonna take his balls

696
00:59:49,266 --> 00:59:52,408
and cut them off
and throw them to the sharks!

697
00:59:52,836 --> 00:59:55,580
Watch out, boys, here comes the fuzz.

698
01:00:03,447 --> 01:00:05,497
Unit B, what's your 20?

699
01:00:06,550 --> 01:00:10,227
Now, Neal,
I'm very excited you found the box.

700
01:00:11,822 --> 01:00:14,805
May I see it? Hans, get him his money.

701
01:00:15,459 --> 01:00:17,526
Remember, you're not gonna just
drop off the box and walk out.

702
01:00:17,527 --> 01:00:19,804
You have to get him talking.

703
01:00:23,667 --> 01:00:27,446
You gonna tell me what's in the box
before I give it back?

704
01:00:28,772 --> 01:00:30,321
Your future.

705
01:00:39,249 --> 01:00:41,094
You passed, Neal.

706
01:00:41,651 --> 01:00:44,895
I wanted to see if you'd follow through
with your promise.

707
01:00:47,057 --> 01:00:50,005
Are you saying this is some sort of test?

708
01:00:53,697 --> 01:00:55,075
Come on.

709
01:00:55,866 --> 01:00:57,381
The Mensch?

710
01:00:58,468 --> 01:01:00,202
His trio of assassins?

711
01:01:00,203 --> 01:01:04,312
The Mensch was a test of my patience,
that is for sure.

712
01:01:06,409 --> 01:01:11,155
The assassins, however,
generally, they're freelance.

713
01:01:11,948 --> 01:01:14,123
Their services go to the highest bidder.

714
01:01:17,420 --> 01:01:19,470
They tried to kill me.

715
01:01:20,991 --> 01:01:23,974
They had to appear to be your adversaries.

716
01:01:25,295 --> 01:01:27,830
But, really,
they were meant to be your guides.

717
01:01:27,831 --> 01:01:30,814
You've gotta get him to talk.
Get a clean statement now.

718
01:01:32,035 --> 01:01:35,621
Wait a second. What about Madison?

719
01:01:36,206 --> 01:01:39,792
She ran off with the box.
How'd you know I'd find her?

720
01:01:42,279 --> 01:01:43,487
No way.

721
01:01:43,513 --> 01:01:45,426
You trust this girl?

722
01:01:47,918 --> 01:01:51,128
I saw her on the street that day.
I found her.

723
01:01:51,888 --> 01:01:55,224
How silly of me to assume
that a man with your sexual appetite

724
01:01:55,225 --> 01:01:58,811
would spot a beautiful woman
and instinctively follow.

725
01:02:15,712 --> 01:02:19,263
Like I said, you passed the test.

726
01:02:21,885 --> 01:02:24,620
Neal, make the drop-off and get out.

727
01:02:24,621 --> 01:02:27,706
We have got nothing unless you get
a clean statement. Do it now.

728
01:02:28,158 --> 01:02:30,708
I said you could have everything.

729
01:02:31,361 --> 01:02:34,969
The money, power, the women.

730
01:02:40,470 --> 01:02:43,817
What if I told you everything was yours?

731
01:02:44,975 --> 01:02:47,355
The keys to the kingdom, Neal.

732
01:02:48,078 --> 01:02:51,391
Everything your grandfather dreamed
was possible.

733
01:03:01,625 --> 01:03:04,403
And everything your mother threw away.

734
01:03:07,430 --> 01:03:10,947
Neal, do not listen to him. Get out.

735
01:03:15,572 --> 01:03:18,885
I trusted your allegiance
was in the right place.

736
01:03:20,677 --> 01:03:22,818
You didn't disappoint me.

737
01:03:24,080 --> 01:03:25,822
You earned this.

738
01:03:26,816 --> 01:03:29,958
Now go pay Sonny and we'll talk further.

739
01:03:39,062 --> 01:03:43,046
What, are you gonna make my arm fall off?
Come get your money.

740
01:03:45,869 --> 01:03:48,954
Neal, what the hell is going on?
Talk to me.

741
01:03:53,510 --> 01:03:56,288
Now you know where my allegiance lies.

742
01:03:57,280 --> 01:04:00,297
- Cut the lights now! Cut the lights now!
- Go, go, go, go!

743
01:04:12,028 --> 01:04:14,078
Neal! It's okay!

744
01:04:18,034 --> 01:04:20,436
Look, you had a momentary lapse
of judgment,

745
01:04:20,437 --> 01:04:23,706
but I'm an understanding guy.
They got nothing on me. No harm done.

746
01:04:23,707 --> 01:04:26,587
I got your money.
We can still get out of here.

747
01:04:26,710 --> 01:04:27,986
Neal.

748
01:04:29,746 --> 01:04:31,227
I'm dying.

749
01:04:31,648 --> 01:04:35,284
You're my last chance to make
a meaningful contribution to this world.

750
01:04:35,285 --> 01:04:37,869
I'm asking for you and me
not to be enemies.

751
01:04:38,788 --> 01:04:41,805
Nicholas! Don't you fucking move.

752
01:04:42,926 --> 01:04:45,067
Stay right fucking there.

753
01:04:45,695 --> 01:04:48,464
Yeah, only one missing
from this little reunion.

754
01:04:48,465 --> 01:04:51,550
- Son, get out of here.
- Your mother, Neal.

755
01:04:53,003 --> 01:04:57,112
- Come with me, you'll know everything.
- That is not a suggestion, it's an order.

756
01:05:00,577 --> 01:05:03,560
Go ahead. We'll meet next week for coffee.

757
01:05:15,358 --> 01:05:20,070
Looks like I win, Nick.
Your little reign of terror is over.

758
01:05:22,799 --> 01:05:25,679
What could you possibly find so amusing?

759
01:05:26,069 --> 01:05:30,553
This reminds me of when we were kids.
I used to shoot pigeons out back.

760
01:05:31,274 --> 01:05:32,708
- Pigeons?
- Captain, what's your 10-20?

761
01:05:32,709 --> 01:05:34,076
Rats from the sky.

762
01:05:34,077 --> 01:05:36,678
I'm around back.
I'll hold him till you get here.

763
01:05:36,679 --> 01:05:40,287
They shit everywhere.
They terrorized the cat.

764
01:05:41,317 --> 01:05:46,200
They stole birdseed from the cardinals
and the gold finches, the noble birds.

765
01:05:46,389 --> 01:05:49,975
You came out back one day
and objected to my action.

766
01:05:50,560 --> 01:05:54,663
Yeah, I broke your fucking nose.
I'm behind the warehouse, standing by.

767
01:05:54,664 --> 01:05:59,012
Dad came out.
He saw my nose bloodied, shattered.

768
01:05:59,903 --> 01:06:02,738
But he warned you,
one of these days I'd grow up

769
01:06:02,739 --> 01:06:05,874
and you wouldn't be able
to pick on me anymore.

770
01:06:05,875 --> 01:06:07,549
And you said...

771
01:06:08,445 --> 01:06:10,790
You'll never be as big as me.

772
01:06:11,781 --> 01:06:13,091
Right.

773
01:06:16,352 --> 01:06:20,302
Nick, stop fucking around. Don't do this.

774
01:06:25,595 --> 01:06:28,077
Come on, Zeke, pick up. Pick up.

775
01:06:28,398 --> 01:06:31,133
For some reason,
you've always been known as the guy

776
01:06:31,134 --> 01:06:33,980
who did what he thought was right.

777
01:06:34,237 --> 01:06:36,651
I guess that's how you got to be
where you are.

778
01:06:41,177 --> 01:06:43,479
And I will always be known as the guy

779
01:06:43,480 --> 01:06:47,964
who was willing to do
what the other guy wasn't.

780
01:06:48,218 --> 01:06:49,835
God damn you.

781
01:07:04,067 --> 01:07:05,167
Zeke?

782
01:07:05,168 --> 01:07:07,286
No, I'm looking for Zeke.
Do you know where he is?

783
01:07:07,570 --> 01:07:11,039
Hey, Bannen, look,
I know you're doing the drop-off right now

784
01:07:11,040 --> 01:07:13,575
and I'm maybe being paranoid,

785
01:07:13,576 --> 01:07:18,547
but the guy I saw, the other guys,
like big guys snooping around...

786
01:07:18,548 --> 01:07:20,996
So I thought maybe you could...

787
01:07:23,219 --> 01:07:24,996
Hold on. Hold on.

788
01:07:26,990 --> 01:07:31,167
No! No, no! No! Bannen!

789
01:07:35,598 --> 01:07:38,683
Don't worry, guys.
I'll get him back somehow.

790
01:07:39,002 --> 01:07:42,485
Can we help, Bannen? Mr. Bannen?

791
01:07:43,273 --> 01:07:47,976
I am good with guns.
I've got, like, a 98% headshot kill ratio.

792
01:07:47,977 --> 01:07:50,652
- Hello?
- Be cool, all right? Be cool.

793
01:07:54,384 --> 01:07:55,865
Thank you.

794
01:08:22,745 --> 01:08:26,058
Dr. Travis,
you have a visitor in the main lobby.

795
01:08:26,816 --> 01:08:30,403
- I don't want to hear "I'm sorry. "
- I wasn't going to say I'm sorry.

796
01:08:32,088 --> 01:08:33,355
Code of thieves, huh?

797
01:08:33,356 --> 01:08:36,024
You know, you should actually appreciate
the fact that I took a job

798
01:08:36,025 --> 01:08:39,542
and followed through with it.
You, on the other hand,

799
01:08:40,163 --> 01:08:42,331
you just had to screw up my deal
with Mr. B, didn't you?

800
01:08:42,332 --> 01:08:45,267
You know what my favorite thing was?
This was my favorite.

801
01:08:45,268 --> 01:08:48,649
Unbutton, unbutton, unbutton.

802
01:08:49,639 --> 01:08:53,075
You're so dramatic.
You owe me money, Bannen.

803
01:08:53,076 --> 01:08:56,252
- I owe you money?
- Yes. 500 grand.

804
01:08:57,080 --> 01:08:59,748
That's up from the $5 for a handjob.

805
01:08:59,749 --> 01:09:01,992
- You think that's funny?
- Yeah.

806
01:09:03,052 --> 01:09:04,931
That was a freebie.

807
01:09:07,357 --> 01:09:08,701
You're gonna slap me?

808
01:09:11,060 --> 01:09:13,762
You're gonna have to let go of one of them
if you want another handjob.

809
01:09:13,763 --> 01:09:15,005
Yeah?

810
01:09:17,667 --> 01:09:21,446
You know how fucked I am right now?
Zeke's been kidnapped,

811
01:09:21,971 --> 01:09:26,319
my dad's been shot by my uncle,
and it's probably my fault.

812
01:09:27,577 --> 01:09:30,218
So today's arguably the worst day
of my life.

813
01:09:33,750 --> 01:09:37,495
And for some reason,
all I can think about...

814
01:09:40,323 --> 01:09:44,569
Yeah, well, don't be fooled now,
because all I want is my money.

815
01:09:45,828 --> 01:09:48,173
Yeah? Prove it.

816
01:10:09,452 --> 01:10:13,504
- It's Jim, one of Sonny's guys.
- Mr. B is calling me.

817
01:10:13,990 --> 01:10:15,457
Sonny's got Zeke.

818
01:10:15,458 --> 01:10:18,226
He's threatening to kill him
unless we bring him the box.

819
01:10:18,227 --> 01:10:21,904
Mr. B knows we're together.
He said we can keep the box.

820
01:10:22,398 --> 01:10:25,767
He just wants you to meet him
at Inspiration Point.

821
01:10:25,768 --> 01:10:28,437
I'm not meeting him at Inspiration Point.

822
01:10:28,438 --> 01:10:31,887
I'm doing this alone.
I don't want you getting hurt.

823
01:10:32,141 --> 01:10:34,418
Bannen, I'm going with you.

824
01:11:06,309 --> 01:11:08,689
Look, Sonny. The box.

825
01:11:11,447 --> 01:11:15,124
No games. I just want the kid.

826
01:11:17,553 --> 01:11:21,332
I don't want any trouble.
I want to be done with all this.

827
01:11:47,617 --> 01:11:51,601
- Francis, untie the kid.
- What? That's it?

828
01:12:00,329 --> 01:12:01,707
Hold on.

829
01:12:13,709 --> 01:12:16,020
How do I open it?

830
01:12:23,219 --> 01:12:25,769
Nobody knows how to open the box.

831
01:12:55,952 --> 01:12:58,627
You like to fuck with me, don't you?

832
01:13:00,590 --> 01:13:03,800
You're always finding new ways
to fuck with me.

833
01:13:06,863 --> 01:13:10,107
Did you enjoy fucking my girl? Catalina?

834
01:13:12,235 --> 01:13:15,582
You're like a connoisseur
of fucking with my life.

835
01:13:20,943 --> 01:13:24,585
And for some reason, you're still alive.

836
01:13:27,250 --> 01:13:28,492
Yeah.

837
01:13:29,252 --> 01:13:31,565
How in the fuck
does he get away with that?

838
01:13:32,016 --> 01:13:33,366
I'm fucked.

839
01:13:40,162 --> 01:13:42,780
You shoot pool?
Shoot some motherfucking pool.

840
01:13:47,670 --> 01:13:52,223
I'm Sonny Carr, and I'm gonna watch you
take a bullet in your gut.

841
01:13:52,975 --> 01:13:54,709
I want to see how charming you are then

842
01:13:54,710 --> 01:13:58,013
when the bullet enters your body
but doesn't blow out your back,

843
01:13:58,014 --> 01:14:00,564
so you fight the urge to squirm.

844
01:14:00,950 --> 01:14:03,251
I'm gonna wipe that pretty,
charming boy smile

845
01:14:03,252 --> 01:14:07,270
off your dying motherfucking face!

846
01:15:13,122 --> 01:15:16,057
I cannot let you fuck with me anymore,
pretty boy.

847
01:15:16,058 --> 01:15:19,094
You're dying right here
on this motherfucking pool table.

848
01:15:19,095 --> 01:15:21,270
Eight ball, corner pocket.

849
01:15:26,002 --> 01:15:29,144
Give me my gun! Give me my gun!

850
01:15:33,442 --> 01:15:37,028
Mami, what are you doing with papi's gun?

851
01:15:39,882 --> 01:15:42,933
Shoot him, Mami. Go ahead, mama.

852
01:15:44,286 --> 01:15:49,424
No. Shoot him, mama. Give me...
Give papi the gun, mama.

853
01:15:49,425 --> 01:15:51,760
Look, I'll make it up to you.
I didn't mean to hurt you.

854
01:15:51,761 --> 01:15:56,177
Mama, it's loaded. Give me the gun.
Mama, we'll make love, sweet love.

855
01:16:05,341 --> 01:16:08,119
Give me the gun. Tell me, mama...

856
01:16:09,879 --> 01:16:11,257
Francis!

857
01:16:16,786 --> 01:16:19,496
Francis? You all right?

858
01:16:23,959 --> 01:16:27,374
Stupid bitch. Fucking waste.

859
01:16:31,667 --> 01:16:35,776
Who's the fucking man now, Sonny, huh?
Who's in charge now, huh?

860
01:16:37,873 --> 01:16:40,116
Who's in charge now, right?

861
01:16:45,247 --> 01:16:47,297
I never liked that guy.

862
01:16:56,492 --> 01:16:59,372
Fuck. Out of bullets.

863
01:17:00,563 --> 01:17:03,011
I guess today's your lucky day.

864
01:17:10,439 --> 01:17:12,648
Thanks. You good?

865
01:17:14,043 --> 01:17:18,323
Yeah. I mean, I was thinking
about starting my own business anyway.

866
01:17:18,814 --> 01:17:23,196
I could still use that 200 G's.
Little Tommy needs some braces.

867
01:17:23,519 --> 01:17:25,967
- Right.
- Go on, get out of here.

868
01:17:26,388 --> 01:17:29,632
I'm sure I'll catch up with you
sooner or later.

869
01:17:32,328 --> 01:17:33,672
Bannen.

870
01:17:36,165 --> 01:17:38,545
Let's just say you owe me one.

871
01:18:00,289 --> 01:18:02,168
You look like shit.

872
01:18:04,426 --> 01:18:06,373
I am so proud of you.

873
01:18:07,129 --> 01:18:10,476
The D.A. says we haven't got enough
on my brother.

874
01:18:10,900 --> 01:18:13,075
I'll plead on your behalf.

875
01:18:13,269 --> 01:18:17,185
For 60 years that prick's
wanted to shoot me,

876
01:18:18,307 --> 01:18:21,392
but he'd never,
never break his golden rule.

877
01:18:27,316 --> 01:18:29,457
Always covers his tracks.

878
01:18:29,618 --> 01:18:32,703
Uses his fall guys to take out his trash.

879
01:18:33,823 --> 01:18:35,941
- Dimitri shot you?
- Yeah.

880
01:18:36,158 --> 01:18:39,766
And unless Nicholas admits guilt,
we may never get him.

881
01:18:41,964 --> 01:18:44,412
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Jesus.

882
01:18:46,001 --> 01:18:47,743
Dad, just relax.

883
01:18:52,875 --> 01:18:57,145
He keeps bringing up Mom.
I mean, what did he mean at the warehouse

884
01:18:57,146 --> 01:19:00,493
when he said,
"Everything your mother threw away"?

885
01:19:03,252 --> 01:19:05,802
It's time you heard this from me.

886
01:19:06,589 --> 01:19:09,924
I haven't told you the truth
because I tried to protect you.

887
01:19:09,925 --> 01:19:12,600
It's not gonna change what happened.

888
01:19:14,230 --> 01:19:18,111
- It's not gonna change what he did.
- What did he do?

889
01:19:18,367 --> 01:19:23,250
I was afraid of what you would do.
I was afraid of what he might do to you.

890
01:19:23,772 --> 01:19:26,152
I loved her so much.

891
01:19:26,508 --> 01:19:29,889
- I swear, there was nothing I could do.
- Sir?

892
01:19:30,613 --> 01:19:32,840
She loved you
from the bottom of her heart.

893
01:19:32,841 --> 01:19:34,215
Sir, I'm gonna need you
to leave.

894
01:19:34,216 --> 01:19:38,097
She... she would never
do anything to hurt you.

895
01:19:38,187 --> 01:19:41,602
- Sir, please, leave.
- I swear to God, she loved you.

896
01:19:43,459 --> 01:19:46,442
Okay. Yep. Okay, thanks.

897
01:19:46,662 --> 01:19:50,965
Hey, all right, so I just spoke to Marcel.
He's in France. He still wants the box.

898
01:19:50,966 --> 01:19:53,346
We need to hop on an airplane.

899
01:19:58,841 --> 01:20:02,290
What's going on? What are you doing?
What happened?

900
01:20:03,178 --> 01:20:05,280
I'm going to Inspiration Point.

901
01:20:05,281 --> 01:20:09,150
Bannen, we'll sell the box.
You're finally gonna start over.

902
01:20:09,151 --> 01:20:11,792
I don't care about the box anymore.

903
01:20:37,913 --> 01:20:39,155
Okay.

904
01:20:40,316 --> 01:20:43,560
If you leave,
I won't be here when you get back.

905
01:21:46,448 --> 01:21:48,566
Tell me about my mother.

906
01:21:50,285 --> 01:21:54,701
Neal Bannen Jr. Pointing a gun.

907
01:21:55,924 --> 01:21:58,668
Did you ever think you'd see the day?

908
01:22:05,100 --> 01:22:07,235
Tell me what you did to her.

909
01:22:07,236 --> 01:22:11,472
That gun you're holding, that was your
grandfather's, you know that.

910
01:22:11,473 --> 01:22:14,490
Cut the shit. I'm clean.

911
01:22:17,312 --> 01:22:20,488
It's just you and me here.
I want the truth.

912
01:22:22,518 --> 01:22:24,465
What happened to her?

913
01:22:26,021 --> 01:22:29,629
When two men, brothers,

914
01:22:31,627 --> 01:22:34,803
love a woman the way we loved her...

915
01:22:38,367 --> 01:22:41,111
What happened to her was an accident.

916
01:22:43,572 --> 01:22:45,485
Facts. Go.

917
01:22:45,741 --> 01:22:47,608
- You were a kid.
- Yes.

918
01:22:47,609 --> 01:22:49,644
- She had a car accident.
- Yes.

919
01:22:49,645 --> 01:22:51,695
I was driving that car.

920
01:22:56,652 --> 01:22:59,794
I was having an affair
with your mother, Neal.

921
01:22:59,822 --> 01:23:04,500
On and off, since before you were born.

922
01:23:14,670 --> 01:23:19,382
- What are you telling me?
- He was drinking. He was in a blind rage.

923
01:23:19,441 --> 01:23:23,550
Are you trying to tell me
that you're my dad?

924
01:23:27,349 --> 01:23:31,452
We kept up the facade as long as possible.
Your mother's choice.

925
01:23:31,453 --> 01:23:35,095
He was suspicious.
He followed us one day in his car.

926
01:23:35,491 --> 01:23:40,135
He tried to run us off the road.
It worked. The car flipped.

927
01:23:42,464 --> 01:23:46,983
Me and him, we blamed each other,
but for the first time in years,

928
01:23:48,070 --> 01:23:52,850
we agreed to cover it up. For your sake.

929
01:24:03,752 --> 01:24:05,653
I'm gonna tell you something here
in a minute

930
01:24:05,654 --> 01:24:09,331
that's gonna upset you. Very much so.

931
01:24:11,460 --> 01:24:14,238
And then I'm going to sit right there,

932
01:24:16,131 --> 01:24:19,182
and you're gonna execute me
for what I did.

933
01:24:19,701 --> 01:24:25,187
Now when you do,
everything I own will be yours.

934
01:24:26,441 --> 01:24:28,476
It may take you a while to realize,

935
01:24:28,477 --> 01:24:31,562
but this is what
you were meant to do, Neal.

936
01:24:32,147 --> 01:24:33,889
I don't want it.

937
01:24:34,049 --> 01:24:37,852
- That's why I put you through this.
- But I don't care. I don't want it.

938
01:24:37,853 --> 01:24:40,521
I'm not going to let you
piss away this opportunity.

939
01:24:40,522 --> 01:24:42,503
But I don't want it!

940
01:24:42,824 --> 01:24:46,894
You apparently missed the memo that says,
"I'm trying to get out of this lifestyle".

941
01:24:46,895 --> 01:24:51,379
This whole wild goose chase that you
put me on to find this stupid box?

942
01:24:51,900 --> 01:24:53,568
I have a theory.

943
01:24:53,569 --> 01:24:57,538
I think you created the box
so you could draw out your enemies.

944
01:24:57,539 --> 01:25:00,575
You knew
if you created enough lore surrounding it

945
01:25:00,576 --> 01:25:04,628
that nobody could resist,
and eventually they'd all get killed.

946
01:25:04,713 --> 01:25:06,228
The Mensch.

947
01:25:07,416 --> 01:25:08,760
Sonny.

948
01:25:10,485 --> 01:25:12,762
So what's really in the box?

949
01:25:13,922 --> 01:25:18,736
I mean, everybody's got their theories.
Ancient masks, diamonds or whatever.

950
01:25:18,894 --> 01:25:21,638
But you and I know it doesn't matter.

951
01:25:22,231 --> 01:25:24,110
And then it hit me.

952
01:25:26,235 --> 01:25:29,946
Nothing. Nothing in the box.

953
01:25:30,973 --> 01:25:33,908
How poetic to think that everything
that everybody wants,

954
01:25:33,909 --> 01:25:36,510
whatever their little greedy minds
come up with,

955
01:25:36,511 --> 01:25:38,652
that's what's in the box.

956
01:25:45,187 --> 01:25:49,205
Brilliant. You wonder why I want you
to be my successor?

957
01:25:51,360 --> 01:25:53,842
God, I wish I'd thought of that.

958
01:25:55,597 --> 01:25:56,907
But...

959
01:25:58,066 --> 01:25:59,274
...no.

960
01:26:03,305 --> 01:26:06,982
Unfortunately, I did put
a little something in that box.

961
01:26:09,044 --> 01:26:12,322
And your girlfriend's gonna be
the first one to find out.

962
01:26:14,783 --> 01:26:17,731
God, I see so much of your mother in her.

963
01:26:17,953 --> 01:26:21,155
I could tell right away
you'd met your match with her.

964
01:26:21,156 --> 01:26:25,593
She was a big asset to me
when I needed her,

965
01:26:25,594 --> 01:26:29,339
but now she's... She's getting in the way.

966
01:26:32,301 --> 01:26:34,612
Neal Bannen's answering service.

967
01:26:34,703 --> 01:26:39,440
Now, you may hate me at first,
but you're gonna have to trust me

968
01:26:39,441 --> 01:26:43,118
when I tell you
that she'd only be a distraction to you.

969
01:26:43,412 --> 01:26:46,622
- Hello?
- She'll appear to be loyal.

970
01:26:47,449 --> 01:26:50,500
Did you really think
I'd leave without you?

971
01:26:51,453 --> 01:26:53,195
Is this Madison?

972
01:26:56,425 --> 01:26:59,874
I promise you,
she won't be there when you get back.

973
01:27:25,153 --> 01:27:26,793
Let's do this.

974
01:27:46,708 --> 01:27:49,554
I'm sorry. It's just too perfect.

975
01:27:52,047 --> 01:27:55,030
We made a replica box.
For The Mensch job?

976
01:27:56,451 --> 01:28:00,654
It was because I was so tired of
the real box that I had to get rid of it.

977
01:28:00,655 --> 01:28:03,899
So on my way
to visit my father at the hospital,

978
01:28:04,126 --> 01:28:06,574
I dropped the real box off at your office.

979
01:28:13,268 --> 01:28:15,909
You just blew up your own building.

980
01:28:19,408 --> 01:28:20,889
Well done.

981
01:28:23,545 --> 01:28:26,186
But you're gonna come around, Neal.

982
01:28:26,581 --> 01:28:31,191
My blood courses through your veins.
You're capable of so much more.

983
01:28:32,354 --> 01:28:36,157
You proved it tonight
by coming here to kill me. Let's do it.

984
01:28:36,158 --> 01:28:37,400
Yeah?

985
01:28:47,803 --> 01:28:48,945
Like I said,

986
01:28:49,296 --> 01:28:51,546
I'm not really
a gun-toting kinda thief.

987
01:29:00,649 --> 01:29:03,962
They got nothing on me.
Just you and me, right?

988
01:29:05,687 --> 01:29:07,737
They got nothing on me.

989
01:29:08,790 --> 01:29:10,805
You're probably right.

990
01:29:12,661 --> 01:29:14,870
Zeke, please tell me you got that.

991
01:29:14,963 --> 01:29:17,673
- Every word.
- Got you.

992
01:29:19,267 --> 01:29:22,636
Sometimes a man has to make up
his own set of rules,

993
01:29:22,637 --> 01:29:24,414
so I added a new one to the Bannen list.

994
01:29:27,709 --> 01:29:31,989
Don't let other people determine
what you should and should not do.

995
01:29:50,065 --> 01:29:52,240
- Nice car.
- Thank you.

996
01:29:55,837 --> 01:29:59,252
- Where'd you get it?
- Just test-driving.
