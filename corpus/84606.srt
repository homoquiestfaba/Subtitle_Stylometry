1
00:00:00,701 --> 00:00:02,134
During their flight to the moon...

2
00:00:02,202 --> 00:00:05,797
the crew of Apollo 13 made a live
color television broadcast...

3
00:00:05,872 --> 00:00:08,466
back to Earth
that was largely ignored.

4
00:00:08,542 --> 00:00:11,477
Moments after the end of the TV show,
an explosion occurred...

5
00:00:11,545 --> 00:00:13,809
which put the lives
of the crew in danger...

6
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:17,976
and made it impossible for any further
pictures to be seen back home.

7
00:00:18,051 --> 00:00:20,986
The remaining dramatic days
of the flight played themselves out...

8
00:00:21,054 --> 00:00:23,989
by way of only the faint
radio voices of the crew...

9
00:00:24,057 --> 00:00:27,288
the sketchy telemetry data
from the crippled spacecraft...

10
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:30,159
and the reports from the media
that suddenly found itself...

11
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:33,165
as blind to the events
as the rest of the world...

12
00:00:33,233 --> 00:00:37,499
a world which had become bored
with TV shows from outer space.

13
00:00:37,571 --> 00:00:41,507
One of the biggest stories of the year
became one with no TV pictures...

14
00:00:41,575 --> 00:00:43,338
only talking heads...

15
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:47,176
all waiting to see whether
three human beings would survive...

16
00:00:47,247 --> 00:00:49,681
a voyage from the Earth to the moon.

17
00:01:02,496 --> 00:01:05,693
Out the right window now,
you can see our objective:

18
00:01:05,766 --> 00:01:07,199
The moon.

19
00:01:08,935 --> 00:01:11,426
I'll zoom in on it and see
if this brings it in better.

20
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:19,507
We see it, 13.

21
00:01:20,614 --> 00:01:22,479
It's beginning
to look bigger to us now.

22
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:26,110
I can see quite distinctly some
of the features with the naked eye.

23
00:01:26,186 --> 00:01:29,883
So far, though, the moon looks
pretty gray with some white spots.

24
00:01:30,957 --> 00:01:32,390
Roger.

25
00:01:36,296 --> 00:01:39,629
Okay, Houston, for the benefit
of our television viewers...

26
00:01:39,699 --> 00:01:42,827
we've just about completed
our inspection of Aquarius...

27
00:01:42,903 --> 00:01:45,428
and now we're proceeding
back into Odyssey.

28
00:01:49,476 --> 00:01:53,242
Okay, Jim. We think you ought
to conclude it from there now.

29
00:01:53,313 --> 00:01:56,908
Any time you want to terminate TV,
we're all set to go.

30
00:01:57,818 --> 00:01:59,752
It's been a great show.

31
00:02:00,821 --> 00:02:02,254
Roger.

32
00:02:03,557 --> 00:02:05,320
This is the crew of Apollo 13...

33
00:02:05,392 --> 00:02:08,020
wishing everyone there
a nice evening.

34
00:02:08,095 --> 00:02:09,585
Good night.

35
00:02:21,575 --> 00:02:26,774
Okay, 13, we've got a few housekeeping
details for you to take care of.

36
00:02:26,847 --> 00:02:28,542
Go ahead, Houston.

37
00:02:30,917 --> 00:02:34,353
Press Center.
No, I can talk.

38
00:02:34,421 --> 00:02:35,854
Nothing.

39
00:02:37,524 --> 00:02:42,962
Roll right to 0-6-0
and null your rates.

40
00:02:43,029 --> 00:02:44,929
Copy that. 0-6-0.

41
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:47,899
So, what are you doing for dinner?

42
00:02:49,536 --> 00:02:53,131
We'd like you to check
your C-4 thruster isolation valve.

43
00:02:53,206 --> 00:02:56,642
Okay, Jack.

44
00:02:57,744 --> 00:02:59,507
How about lunch?

45
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:02,309
We've got one more item
for you, 13.

46
00:03:02,382 --> 00:03:06,375
When you get a chance,
we'd like you to stir your cryo tanks.

47
00:03:06,453 --> 00:03:08,182
Okay, Houston, stand-by.

48
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:13,718
Yeah, we got space.

49
00:03:13,793 --> 00:03:16,318
As a matter of fact,
we've got a whole lot of space.

50
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:19,388
Yeah. That's why we call it
the Space Center.

51
00:03:19,466 --> 00:03:21,457
Dave, who delivers good take-out?

52
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:24,834
Okay, Houston,
I believe we have a problem here.

53
00:03:26,506 --> 00:03:28,440
This is Houston.
Say again, please.

54
00:03:29,776 --> 00:03:31,835
Houston, we've had a problem.

55
00:03:31,912 --> 00:03:34,380
We've had a main B bus undervolt.

56
00:03:34,447 --> 00:03:37,905
Okay, 13.
Main B undervolt.

57
00:03:37,984 --> 00:03:41,920
All right, Houston. We had a pretty
large bang with caution and warnings.

58
00:03:41,988 --> 00:03:45,048
- What does that mean, a "bang"?
- I don't know. Some kind of jolt.

59
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:47,320
- They had a main B bus undervolt.
- You're kidding.

60
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:49,021
- They're losing power?
- I don't know.

61
00:03:49,095 --> 00:03:51,620
- Could it be an instrumentation problem?
- I think it's more serious.

62
00:03:51,698 --> 00:03:55,065
- Lovell said they're venting something.
- What the hell could they be venting?

63
00:03:55,135 --> 00:03:57,797
They could be running out
of oxygen and electricity.

64
00:03:57,871 --> 00:04:00,897
- It could have been a meteorite.
- It could have been a reindeer.

65
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:03,033
- You'll have to improvise.
- Why?

66
00:04:03,109 --> 00:04:07,443
- I just got McAfee out of bed.
- Emmett, you're on in 90.

67
00:04:07,514 --> 00:04:09,744
I need handbooks for the
command, service, lunar modules.

68
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:11,249
They're not having problems
with the LEM.

69
00:04:11,318 --> 00:04:14,048
They'll have to go somewhere
if Odyssey keeps losing oxygen.

70
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,054
- Yeah, but...
- Mr. Seaborn.

71
00:04:16,122 --> 00:04:19,216
You know Warren Moburg,
new vice president of the news division.

72
00:04:19,292 --> 00:04:21,556
I've been a great fan of yours
ever since radio.

73
00:04:21,628 --> 00:04:24,028
They're powering down Odyssey
and moving to the LEM.

74
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:26,361
- Get me mission rules.
- We're on it.

75
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:29,630
Julie, check the wire. Even a blind
squirrel finds a nut now and then.

76
00:04:29,703 --> 00:04:33,161
You're busy, but let me introduce you to
Brett Hutchins from the Chicago bureau.

77
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,673
It's an honor, sir.

78
00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:36,800
I'm here to do a piece on the Astros,
the baseball team.

79
00:04:36,876 --> 00:04:41,472
He's not just a sports reporter.
Give this boy any kind of story...

80
00:04:41,548 --> 00:04:43,072
Excuse me.

81
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:46,543
Glad to see you're working
the upper management.

82
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,555
A mole at CBS says they've got something
about trajectory and spin.

83
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:51,454
- What about trajectory and spin?
- I don't know.

84
00:04:51,524 --> 00:04:52,957
- Transcripts.
- One minute.

85
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:55,187
- Somebody better have notes.
- I did them.

86
00:04:55,262 --> 00:04:58,789
- We don't have it, son.
- CBS is saying a possible meteorite.

87
00:04:58,865 --> 00:05:00,389
- It wasn't a meteorite.
- How do you know?

88
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:03,436
Larry, there are
48,700 electrical connections...

89
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:05,061
in the command module alone.

90
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:06,833
- Forty.
- The chances of one of them fritzing...

91
00:05:06,906 --> 00:05:10,535
are a lot better
than being hit by a meteorite.

92
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:12,703
Here it is,
but it's totally routine.

93
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:16,545
They asked them to roll right
at 0-6-0 and null...

94
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:18,607
- Null their rates?
- Yeah, that's it.

95
00:05:18,685 --> 00:05:21,586
- What else?
- Something here about C-4 thrusters.

96
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:23,987
- Check C-4 thruster valve?
- Yeah.

97
00:05:24,057 --> 00:05:25,854
- Bingo!
- Coming to us in 30.

98
00:05:25,925 --> 00:05:28,189
- Who are you calling?
- A little birdie in the ops center.

99
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:30,786
They've had trouble
with those thrusters before.

100
00:05:30,864 --> 00:05:33,458
Ten cents says something
inside that ship blew up.

101
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:36,468
- There is no time.
- Don't stand there.

102
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:38,902
Find out what kind of crap
they're feeding Cronkite.

103
00:05:38,972 --> 00:05:41,532
It is not known yet
just what happened.

104
00:05:41,608 --> 00:05:44,133
Perhaps it was hit by a meteoroid.
Perhaps there was an explosion.

105
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:47,976
- Anything I can do?
- Get me the Astros-Cubs score.

106
00:05:48,048 --> 00:05:51,040
- What do you think?
- I hope it wasn't a meteorite.

107
00:05:51,117 --> 00:05:53,244
It doesn't matter.
Those poor guys are screwed.

108
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,720
No one can predict these things
precisely.

109
00:05:55,789 --> 00:05:58,349
There appears to be no better
than a ten percent chance...

110
00:05:58,425 --> 00:06:01,861
that the crew of Apollo 13
will make it home alive.

111
00:06:01,928 --> 00:06:04,192
Rosen's predicting
they won't make it back.

112
00:06:04,264 --> 00:06:06,630
I just need a yes or a no.

113
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:09,999
Can you look me in the eye and say
this came from outside the ship?

114
00:06:11,237 --> 00:06:12,932
We're on in 15.
What's he doing?

115
00:06:13,006 --> 00:06:15,600
I don't know what he's doing.

116
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:18,166
Sorry to intrude,
but we're on in ten.

117
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:21,304
Thank you.

118
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:22,814
You owe me a dime.

119
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:25,715
- I never took the bet.
- Is he always like this?

120
00:06:25,785 --> 00:06:27,912
Emmett Seaborn
is following that story.

121
00:06:27,987 --> 00:06:32,549
Apollo 13 is America's 23rd manned
space flight, and tonight it appears...

122
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:38,063
that no previous mission has ever posed
a greater risk to the lives of its crew.

123
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:42,534
NASA's flight controllers, having
successfully guided four missions...

124
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:47,767
It's Brett Hutchins.
Are you watching your TV?

125
00:06:51,311 --> 00:06:54,405
I'd love to be out there.
Who loves baseball more than me?

126
00:06:54,481 --> 00:06:59,714
I have to stay here and pitch Moburg
a piece on the astronauts' families.

127
00:06:59,786 --> 00:07:05,224
Yeah, I know they're under wraps.
Screw NASA. It's worth a shot, right?

128
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:10,285
- Great. Yeah.
- As a result...

129
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:12,490
the astronauts will likely
use the lunar module's engine...

130
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:15,466
to send them
on a slingshot course...

131
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:17,867
- around the moon and back to Earth.
- Thank you. Good-bye.

132
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:22,169
But is the relatively tiny Aquarius
up to the task?

133
00:07:22,242 --> 00:07:27,145
That, unfortunately, is a question
that no one can answer.

134
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:29,738
13, Houston,
we're water critical in the LEM...

135
00:07:29,816 --> 00:07:32,080
so we'd like to use
as little as possible.

136
00:07:32,152 --> 00:07:35,610
We'd like to make a free return maneuver
of a 16-foot-per-second burn...

137
00:07:35,688 --> 00:07:37,588
in about 37 minutes.

138
00:07:37,657 --> 00:07:40,558
Could you give us
a little bit more time?

139
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:44,393
We're working up a PAD for it. What do
you think about doing it at that time?

140
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:49,528
We'll give it a try, Houston,
if that's all we got.

141
00:07:49,702 --> 00:07:52,068
Press Center. Please hold.

142
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:56,270
They're not telling us anything.

143
00:07:56,342 --> 00:07:59,277
I can't make 15 minutes.

144
00:07:59,345 --> 00:08:00,835
Copy.

145
00:08:00,914 --> 00:08:03,542
We've tentatively scheduled
the briefing for 11:30.

146
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:05,641
- Is that Houston time?
- Yes.

147
00:08:05,718 --> 00:08:07,652
That's 15 minutes
after the final.

148
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,881
I'm sorry.
We're doing the best we can.

149
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:13,855
- How do I get a desk?
- Good luck.

150
00:08:13,927 --> 00:08:17,260
Press Center, please hold.
Sam.

151
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,958
- Not now, Shirley.
- New York Times wants an exclusive.

152
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:22,501
- Tell them I'll call later.
- Call their office.

153
00:08:22,569 --> 00:08:24,969
Hal, are the astronauts
out of oxygen?

154
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:26,869
If they were,
they wouldn't be breathing.

155
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,635
- So, they are breathing?
- Yeah.

156
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:30,938
- Are they wearing space suits?
- They're in their shirt sleeves.

157
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:34,241
- Excuse me. Yeah?
- I have calls from Reuters and the AP.

158
00:08:34,314 --> 00:08:36,680
If we don't handle this thing,
it will spread like kudzu.

159
00:08:36,749 --> 00:08:38,307
"Crew equipped with suicide pills"?

160
00:08:38,384 --> 00:08:40,477
Are suicide pills included
in the crew rations?

161
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:43,147
Are those the same little pills
the CIA uses?

162
00:08:43,223 --> 00:08:45,248
Guys, there are no suicide pills,
period.

163
00:08:45,325 --> 00:08:48,419
I'll cover all this in greater detail
at the press conference. Excuse me.

164
00:08:48,495 --> 00:08:50,463
The nets want to patch
into the loop.

165
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:53,863
- Cronkite wants to remote from ops.
- I'll deal with Cronkite.

166
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:56,299
Protocol is flying
Jack Swigert's folks into town.

167
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,667
We're to make sure
there's no press and...

168
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,536
- And that.
- How did he get here?

169
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:06,306
- Probably through a sewer.
- They're finally putting you to work.

170
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:08,540
- What are you doing here, Stan?
- I don't know if you've heard...

171
00:09:08,615 --> 00:09:11,083
but I'm now the vice president's
press representative...

172
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:12,708
for the National Aeronautics
and Space Council.

173
00:09:12,785 --> 00:09:14,650
I heard.
What are you doing here?

174
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:17,383
Surely, you haven't forgotten
Vice President Agnew's visit tomorrow.

175
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:21,458
Yeah, I guess it did slip my mind.

176
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:37,433
People, we'll try to move this along
as quickly as possible...

177
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:41,742
because, obviously, we have matters
to attend to in Mission Control.

178
00:09:41,814 --> 00:09:43,805
I assume that Deke Slayton,
Chris Kraft...

179
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:46,044
and Colonel James McDivitt
need no introduction.

180
00:09:48,021 --> 00:09:51,787
The command module's never been
powered down in flight before.

181
00:09:51,858 --> 00:09:54,588
Are you certain
you can power it back up?

182
00:09:54,661 --> 00:09:57,129
While it's true that
we've never done it before...

183
00:09:57,196 --> 00:10:01,030
every time we've pushed the hardware,
it's done more than we thought it would.

184
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,263
We're confident
that this is going to work.

185
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:09,007
- The astronauts' families...
- Raise your hands, please. Max.

186
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:12,636
Deke, any more information
on what may have caused the damage...

187
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:15,442
to the service module?

188
00:10:15,515 --> 00:10:17,483
Frankly, that is still a mystery.

189
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,211
We probably won't know anything...

190
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:23,415
until we jettison the service module
and get a good look at the thing.

191
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:27,425
With three astronauts
crowded into the LEM...

192
00:10:27,493 --> 00:10:31,486
isn't there a chance the CO2 levels
could get dangerously high?

193
00:10:31,564 --> 00:10:33,498
That is something
we are looking at.

194
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:37,593
We are studying ways to fit Odyssey's
lithium hydroxide filters into Aquarius.

195
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:39,331
We don't have an answer yet.

196
00:10:39,405 --> 00:10:42,169
- Will the astronauts' families...
- What about the reports...

197
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:44,971
that the crew will run out of water
and oxygen before reaching Earth?

198
00:10:45,044 --> 00:10:46,238
Let me answer that.

199
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:50,180
Apollo 13 is on the non-free
return trajectory...

200
00:10:50,249 --> 00:10:53,309
it needed to reach its target
at Fra Mauro.

201
00:10:53,386 --> 00:10:56,446
Our first priority is to get it
on a slingshot route...

202
00:10:56,522 --> 00:10:58,183
that will use the moon's gravity...

203
00:10:58,257 --> 00:11:01,317
to whip it around the backside
and bring them back home.

204
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:04,454
We're overdue for the happy line.

205
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:06,464
Let's give them 20.

206
00:11:07,567 --> 00:11:09,626
To answer Jerry's question...

207
00:11:09,702 --> 00:11:12,000
it will still take four days
for the crew to get home...

208
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:14,266
and we are concerned
about consumables.

209
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:17,468
That's why we'll have
a second speed-up burn...

210
00:11:17,543 --> 00:11:19,135
a PC plus two...

211
00:11:19,212 --> 00:11:22,648
two hours after the craft
has reached the far side of the moon.

212
00:11:22,715 --> 00:11:25,013
It will be about 8:00 this evening.

213
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:27,575
- If the situation remains stable...
- Ignition.

214
00:11:27,654 --> 00:11:29,554
We'll have the thing
under control...

215
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:33,558
and return the crew safely to Earth
within three days.

216
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:36,527
- Liftoff.
- Sir!

217
00:11:37,897 --> 00:11:39,990
Forty percent.

218
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:42,660
Aquarius, you're looking good.

219
00:11:42,735 --> 00:11:47,331
Auto shutdown.
You're looking at 1685 now.

220
00:11:48,574 --> 00:11:51,668
You're go in the residuals.
No trim required.

221
00:11:53,413 --> 00:11:56,507
No trim. Is that right?

222
00:11:56,582 --> 00:11:59,176
That's affirmative.
No trim required.

223
00:12:06,259 --> 00:12:08,853
Listen, I know we scheduled
that interview with Jane tomorrow...

224
00:12:08,928 --> 00:12:11,192
but we'll have to postpone.

225
00:12:11,264 --> 00:12:14,529
- I totally understand.
- I'll make it up to you.

226
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,364
When this thing is all over,
you'll get the first exclusive.

227
00:12:17,437 --> 00:12:20,031
- That's great. I appreciate that.
- Sure.

228
00:12:20,106 --> 00:12:23,701
- Can we talk about the press pool?
- Emmett, don't start that.

229
00:12:23,776 --> 00:12:26,745
We understand that you need
to bring these men home.

230
00:12:26,813 --> 00:12:29,976
We don't want to compromise that,
but we're in the dark.

231
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:32,381
You want pool reports
from the control center?

232
00:12:32,452 --> 00:12:36,616
Mission Control's across the courtyard
100 yards from here...

233
00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:38,418
where we aren't allowed to be.

234
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:42,325
Unless we know what you know when you
know it, we'll start getting paranoid.

235
00:12:42,395 --> 00:12:44,022
We'll have a press pool of two...

236
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:47,089
one print, one broadcast,
rotated every two hours...

237
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:50,795
in the visitors' gallery where they can
monitor the flight director's loop.

238
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:52,394
We hear everything he hears...

239
00:12:52,472 --> 00:12:56,135
but no taping or broadcast of
the flight controller's communications.

240
00:12:56,209 --> 00:12:59,144
Damn it, Hal. You know
it's the right thing to do.

241
00:12:59,212 --> 00:13:01,840
- What about the families?
- I'm sorry?

242
00:13:01,914 --> 00:13:04,542
Will NASA make the families available
for interviews...

243
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:07,108
or comments
as the situation unfolds?

244
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:14,525
Brett, these individuals
are private citizens.

245
00:13:14,594 --> 00:13:16,289
Oh, please. "Private citizens"?

246
00:13:16,362 --> 00:13:19,456
For the last ten years
these private citizens...

247
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:23,161
have availed themselves of free clothes,
free cars and junkets.

248
00:13:23,236 --> 00:13:25,363
NASA paraded them around
like prized poodles.

249
00:13:25,438 --> 00:13:29,306
Now when the going gets tough,
the tough issue a quarantine?

250
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:31,343
Uh-huh.

251
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:37,148
Interview the families
when the loved ones are safely home.

252
00:13:37,216 --> 00:13:40,583
- I think we all understand that, Hal.
- Actually, I think it's important...

253
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:43,713
Like I said,
it's just not gonna be a problem.

254
00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:50,518
- Appreciate that.
- Thanks, Hal.

255
00:13:58,471 --> 00:14:01,963
- Mr. Hutchings...
- Hutchins. Call me Brett.

256
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:07,777
- What are you doing?
- Just trying to get a story.

257
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:13,012
Look, son, these family members
are ordinary people, regular folks.

258
00:14:13,085 --> 00:14:16,748
Who signed up to be historic figures
courtesy of the U.S. Taxpayer.

259
00:14:16,823 --> 00:14:19,121
Nobody put a gun to their head
and made them do this.

260
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:23,561
Don't the shareholders have a right to
know the real cost of the space program?

261
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:26,223
There are better ways
to build a relationship with NASA.

262
00:14:26,299 --> 00:14:28,665
I don't want
a relationship with NASA.

263
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:36,634
Do your job however you do it,
but keep it out of my corner.

264
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:38,768
I'm trying to get something
accomplished here.

265
00:14:39,979 --> 00:14:41,412
Me too.

266
00:14:56,195 --> 00:14:57,822
I'm standing
in front of the house...

267
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:01,162
of Commander Jim Lovell,
the astronaut who's trapped in orbit.

268
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:10,667
What's your name?

269
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:12,973
How do you spell it?

270
00:15:13,045 --> 00:15:15,707
- Should we get this?
- The paper boy?

271
00:15:16,849 --> 00:15:18,874
Why don't we
just interview their dog?

272
00:15:21,187 --> 00:15:23,121
This is ridiculous.

273
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:28,889
It's the paper boy.

274
00:15:28,961 --> 00:15:30,394
Good work, morons.

275
00:15:48,347 --> 00:15:49,780
Give me a couple minutes.

276
00:15:52,184 --> 00:15:54,152
Hi, I'm Brett Hutchins.

277
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:56,381
Are you one of the reporters?

278
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:57,888
Yeah.

279
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:01,123
My mom told me not to talk
to any reporters.

280
00:16:01,193 --> 00:16:04,287
That's fine.
I was...

281
00:16:04,363 --> 00:16:08,299
I'm in a bind, and I wanted to know
if I can use your telephone?

282
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:10,358
My mom told me to keep the reporters
off our property.

283
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:12,768
Of course.
That's good.

284
00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:16,741
I wouldn't want you
to disobey your mom.

285
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:21,178
But I'll be real fast.
I'll be on and off, you know?

286
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:24,248
Like a jackrabbit.

287
00:16:26,118 --> 00:16:27,813
What's your name?

288
00:16:27,887 --> 00:16:29,684
Doris.

289
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:36,360
That's my mother's name.

290
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,395
At the Lovell household,
the vigil continues.

291
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:46,632
Each passing moment bringing new hope
and new terrors.

292
00:16:46,706 --> 00:16:48,799
A mother comforting a young son...

293
00:16:48,874 --> 00:16:52,139
pointing the path of his father's
desperately-prayed-for return.

294
00:16:52,211 --> 00:16:55,009
- Stop. Did you shoot this from a tree?
- How did you know?

295
00:16:55,081 --> 00:16:59,074
How do we know they're not pointing
at the clouds saying, "I see a horsey"?

296
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:01,585
- It's obvious what they're saying.
- If you read lips.

297
00:17:01,654 --> 00:17:03,212
Larry, this is brilliant reporting.

298
00:17:03,289 --> 00:17:05,189
- This is reporting?
- Yes.

299
00:17:11,831 --> 00:17:13,765
Houston, we're burning 40 percent.

300
00:17:15,267 --> 00:17:16,700
Houston, copy.

301
00:17:18,938 --> 00:17:20,371
One hundred percent.

302
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:23,404
Roger, Aquarius.
You're looking good.

303
00:17:25,077 --> 00:17:28,569
Aquarius, you were looking good
at two minutes and still looking good.

304
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,482
Roger.

305
00:17:35,688 --> 00:17:39,556
Don't forget descent rate one off.
Ten seconds to go.

306
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:43,959
This is Apollo Control
at 79 hours, 28 minutes.

307
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:48,490
- The crew of Apollo 13 is currently...
- Roger. Shutdown.

308
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:50,694
Are you reading our 1640, Houston?

309
00:17:51,971 --> 00:17:54,201
We're reading it.
Good burn, Aquarius.

310
00:17:56,642 --> 00:17:58,872
What's happening here?

311
00:17:58,944 --> 00:18:00,377
History.

312
00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:04,308
Now we want to power down
as soon as possible.

313
00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:08,743
Roger. Understand.

314
00:18:08,821 --> 00:18:11,346
Suggest you just read off
the circuit breakers...

315
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:13,915
you want us to power down,
as you did yesterday for us.

316
00:18:19,298 --> 00:18:23,098
We have a procedure ready to send up
to you here in about two minutes.

317
00:18:23,169 --> 00:18:25,569
Let us know when you're all ready
to take it.

318
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,877
Just going to the head, son.

319
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:39,748
I'm sorry, sir. You can't leave
the area without an escort.

320
00:18:39,819 --> 00:18:42,151
If you can, just wait
till the next shift.

321
00:18:42,221 --> 00:18:45,247
Are you telling me I gotta wait
an hour to take a piss?

322
00:18:48,661 --> 00:18:50,094
Of course not.

323
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:53,230
Thanks.

324
00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:05,736
You look as bad as I feel.

325
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:08,279
Let's not do this again sometime soon.

326
00:19:13,752 --> 00:19:15,185
Paul.

327
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:17,755
Don't ask.

328
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:22,492
People keep forgetting
how cold it is up there.

329
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:25,257
It's hard to think straight
when it's that cold.

330
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:28,494
Let's talk about the nuke problem.

331
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:30,262
How'd you know about that?

332
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:33,999
First of all, I would not
characterize it a "nuke problem."

333
00:19:34,073 --> 00:19:37,839
All I know is LEM's got
a nuclear reactor on board.

334
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:43,348
Technically, but it's got less
than eight pounds of plutonium.

335
00:19:43,415 --> 00:19:45,940
It's the battery
for the lunar surface experiments.

336
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:49,317
- But instead of leaving it on the moon...
- It's flying home to mama.

337
00:19:49,388 --> 00:19:52,516
The boys at the Atomic Energy Commission
are about to go ape shit.

338
00:19:52,591 --> 00:19:54,081
Is that what you're saying?

339
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,755
Apparently, the AEC doesn't think
it makes for good public relations...

340
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:59,798
to bring home radioactive material.

341
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:04,359
Look, this battery is encased
to survive a collision...

342
00:20:04,436 --> 00:20:06,961
or explosion
without contaminating anything.

343
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,064
As long as it doesn't
bonk somebody on the head.

344
00:20:12,144 --> 00:20:13,805
Are you gonna quote me?

345
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:17,110
For Christ's sake, give me
a little credit. What's the plan?

346
00:20:19,451 --> 00:20:21,385
The plan is to throw a wrinkle
into a mission...

347
00:20:21,453 --> 00:20:24,479
that's already got 11,000
too many wrinkles in it.

348
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:28,391
It's like: Forget about the astronauts,
we got politics to worry about.

349
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:31,952
What I'm asking you is:
What do they want you to do about it?

350
00:20:32,031 --> 00:20:34,829
We're floating an idea to adjust the
trajectory so we can dump the sucker...

351
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,765
in the deepest trench
in the Pacific.

352
00:20:36,835 --> 00:20:38,894
If we don't have enough
to worry about already.

353
00:20:40,806 --> 00:20:42,433
Emmett says
he has a major break.

354
00:20:42,508 --> 00:20:44,908
Something about nuclear radiation
and a trench and the LEM.

355
00:20:44,977 --> 00:20:47,707
- He thinks New York should cut in.
- Your call.

356
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,986
Yeah, I know.

357
00:20:58,891 --> 00:21:01,018
Maybe we should
save this for the six.

358
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:04,028
I'll talk to you later.

359
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:19,076
Aquarius, is the noise any better now?

360
00:21:19,144 --> 00:21:23,080
- Negative.
- How do you read us now?

361
00:21:23,148 --> 00:21:27,642
We still have noise.
I'll tell you what we need.

362
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:31,554
Get the right procedures here
before we get all balled up.

363
00:21:32,891 --> 00:21:36,258
Okay, Jim,
we'll look at it some more.

364
00:21:36,328 --> 00:21:40,628
Freddo, I'm afraid this will be
the last moon mission for a long time.

365
00:21:42,001 --> 00:21:45,232
Do you agree with Commander Lovell's
assessment that...

366
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:47,568
this will be our last flight
to the moon?

367
00:21:48,741 --> 00:21:50,675
I'm sure we've all been
in situations...

368
00:21:50,743 --> 00:21:53,177
where we've found ourselves
under pressure...

369
00:21:53,245 --> 00:21:55,805
and we make a comment that
we might have phrased differently...

370
00:21:55,881 --> 00:21:57,815
under other circumstances.

371
00:21:57,883 --> 00:21:59,544
Having said that,
there are...

372
00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:02,086
a lot of questions
that we need answers to...

373
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:05,715
- Didn't Agnew cancel his visit?
- Yeah.

374
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:08,351
So, what's he doing here?

375
00:22:09,695 --> 00:22:13,028
- Emmett's story about the AEC...
- Your exclusive.

376
00:22:13,098 --> 00:22:15,760
- Deep background, of course.
- Okay, shoot.

377
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:19,099
This administration
is urging NASA...

378
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:21,639
to develop
an unmanned probe to Neptune.

379
00:22:23,876 --> 00:22:25,468
A probe to Neptune?

380
00:22:26,645 --> 00:22:29,341
Find some room
in today's story for that.

381
00:22:29,415 --> 00:22:32,851
We have these three guys who may
wind up orbiting Neptune themselves...

382
00:22:32,918 --> 00:22:34,852
so column inches
are a little tight...

383
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,854
but I'll keep you in mind.

384
00:22:38,057 --> 00:22:39,649
Your loss.

385
00:22:44,296 --> 00:22:47,060
- Mr. Craig.
- Yes.

386
00:22:47,132 --> 00:22:49,430
I enjoyed your piece
on the Lovell family.

387
00:22:49,501 --> 00:22:52,061
Good to hear it 'cause...

388
00:22:52,137 --> 00:22:55,834
I understand you're looking to plant
a story about a probe to Neptune.

389
00:23:01,547 --> 00:23:03,879
As a matter of fact, I am.

390
00:23:03,949 --> 00:23:06,247
I know a way
I can make it worth your while.

391
00:23:22,134 --> 00:23:24,034
- Mrs. Swigert. Dr. Swigert.
- Yes.

392
00:23:24,103 --> 00:23:25,695
- And you're?
- Jeff Jordy, sir.

393
00:23:25,771 --> 00:23:28,365
I'm with the NASA Office of Protocol.
Welcome to Houston.

394
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:32,103
I'm sorry about the circumstances.
I hope you have a pleasant flight.

395
00:23:32,177 --> 00:23:37,137
I just hope we didn't miss them.
Come on!

396
00:23:39,218 --> 00:23:41,652
- Just go! Excuse us! Let's go!
- I can't go.

397
00:23:43,655 --> 00:23:46,453
There are the Swigerts right now.
Come on! Go!

398
00:23:49,228 --> 00:23:51,628
Thank you, Stanley Craig.

399
00:23:53,966 --> 00:23:57,595
Hi, Dr. And Mrs. Swigert.
Brett Hutchins, NTC. How do you do?

400
00:23:57,669 --> 00:23:59,466
Get in okay? Safe and sound?

401
00:23:59,538 --> 00:24:03,941
Administration officials say they remain
committed to space exploration.

402
00:24:04,009 --> 00:24:06,341
This aired just after
the press conference this morning.

403
00:24:06,412 --> 00:24:08,676
...their intentions to endorse
an unmanned mission to Neptune...

404
00:24:08,747 --> 00:24:10,180
sometime in the near future.

405
00:24:10,249 --> 00:24:14,015
Why is Brett Hutchins shilling
for Stanley Craig?

406
00:24:14,086 --> 00:24:16,748
Sam, Jeff Jordy for you
on line two.

407
00:24:16,822 --> 00:24:18,255
Thanks, Shirl.

408
00:24:19,358 --> 00:24:20,791
Langfitt.

409
00:24:23,896 --> 00:24:25,591
Hold on.

410
00:24:25,664 --> 00:24:28,724
Guess who just ambushed
Jack Swigert's folks at the airport?

411
00:24:28,801 --> 00:24:31,269
At Mission Control,
I'm Brett Hutchins.

412
00:24:32,738 --> 00:24:34,763
I know Jack's doing
what he loves the most...

413
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:40,938
and I know he's in the best
of hands: God's hands.

414
00:24:41,013 --> 00:24:43,481
You son of a bitch. Don't you think
these people have been through enough?

415
00:24:43,549 --> 00:24:45,676
- We got to get him out of there.
- I think he gives it drama.

416
00:24:45,751 --> 00:24:47,446
Lose it, please. Come on.

417
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:49,544
Brett, they want you on remote
in 23 minutes.

418
00:24:49,621 --> 00:24:51,816
Yes.

419
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:53,915
We're leaving. Now.

420
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:56,017
I can finish this.
Trust me. Go ahead.

421
00:24:57,863 --> 00:25:00,354
Edit three. Hold on.

422
00:25:00,432 --> 00:25:02,559
It's Emmett Seaborn for you.

423
00:25:02,634 --> 00:25:04,158
He's not here. Right.

424
00:25:06,238 --> 00:25:08,468
There's a story that remains untold,
and that is the story...

425
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:12,806
of the excruciating toll on the families
of these three brave men.

426
00:25:12,878 --> 00:25:17,645
Thank you. The untold story of
the excruciating toll on the families...

427
00:25:19,618 --> 00:25:21,848
This afternoon
I had an exclusive interview...

428
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,320
with the parents of command module
pilot Jack Swigert.

429
00:25:24,389 --> 00:25:25,822
They're coming to us in 90.

430
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,964
- Sarah.
- How's my level?

431
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:44,304
- I need a favor, son.
- We're on in 60.

432
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:46,776
I need you to pull this story.

433
00:25:46,845 --> 00:25:48,608
Excuse me?

434
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,648
We're both in this
for the long haul.

435
00:25:50,716 --> 00:25:53,446
- What's going on?
- Hell if I know.

436
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:56,920
- What are you talking about?
- Son, you don't want to burn bridges.

437
00:25:56,989 --> 00:25:59,287
- Thank you for your advice, but...
- No, I mean...

438
00:25:59,358 --> 00:26:02,122
to ambush a defenseless,
old couple like that...

439
00:26:02,194 --> 00:26:04,788
is beneath the dignity
of our profession.

440
00:26:04,863 --> 00:26:07,058
I'd love to debate ethics in journalism
right now, but I have a job to do.

441
00:26:07,132 --> 00:26:10,659
- There's a camera over your shoulder...
- Yeah?

442
00:26:10,736 --> 00:26:13,204
- Thank you. How are my levels?
- We're on top of it.

443
00:26:13,272 --> 00:26:14,762
Get him out of there.

444
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:17,741
Tell Larry we're pulling
the Swigerts footage.

445
00:26:17,809 --> 00:26:19,276
- What?
- What?

446
00:26:19,344 --> 00:26:22,313
- We'll just rewrite your lead.
- Damn it!

447
00:26:22,381 --> 00:26:24,144
I'm just trying
to help you, son.

448
00:26:24,216 --> 00:26:27,344
- Nobody wants to see a mother in pain.
- They do if it's news!

449
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:29,979
That's not news!
It's invasion of privacy!

450
00:26:30,055 --> 00:26:33,081
You think America wants to know about
PC burns and passive thermal rolls?

451
00:26:33,158 --> 00:26:35,251
That's not news, man!
That is Sominex!

452
00:26:35,327 --> 00:26:38,728
Now, please, leave me alone
and just let me do my job!

453
00:26:44,369 --> 00:26:45,927
Ten.

454
00:26:48,707 --> 00:26:50,698
Five, four...

455
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:52,801
three, two...

456
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:57,513
Thank you, Howard. A few hundred yards
from where I'm standing...

457
00:26:57,583 --> 00:27:02,350
over 1,000 journalists from 83 countries
are monitoring every beat and tick...

458
00:27:02,421 --> 00:27:04,048
of this star-crossed mission.

459
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:07,285
But the untold story remains
the excruciating toll...

460
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:10,157
the last few days have had
on the families...

461
00:27:10,228 --> 00:27:12,253
of these three very brave men.

462
00:27:17,369 --> 00:27:19,303
I believe in the space program.

463
00:27:19,371 --> 00:27:21,305
I believe it's worthy.

464
00:27:21,373 --> 00:27:25,503
I believe this country needs heroes.

465
00:27:25,577 --> 00:27:28,045
But I think it's not
just the astronauts...

466
00:27:28,113 --> 00:27:30,377
it's all the men at NASA.

467
00:27:30,449 --> 00:27:33,145
They're all heroes.

468
00:27:33,218 --> 00:27:35,413
And I know that Jack would...

469
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:44,454
That's a great piece of film.

470
00:27:47,699 --> 00:27:50,725
It's been said that Apollo represents
the greatest engineering achievement...

471
00:27:50,802 --> 00:27:52,326
in the history of mankind.

472
00:27:52,404 --> 00:27:55,396
This, we're told,
is the pride of our civilization...

473
00:27:55,474 --> 00:28:00,036
- the triumph of technology over nature.
- Hit us while we're down.

474
00:28:00,112 --> 00:28:01,807
But Apollo 13 teaches us...

475
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:04,974
that the price of technology
is measured not in dollars...

476
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:07,883
but in a mother's love
for her son.

477
00:28:07,953 --> 00:28:11,787
At Mission Control,
I'm Brett Hutchins.

478
00:28:11,857 --> 00:28:15,156
Kid can't even write in English,
for God's sake. Listen to this:

479
00:28:15,227 --> 00:28:18,253
"The price of technology is
measured not in dollars...

480
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:20,264
but in a mother's love
for her son."

481
00:28:20,332 --> 00:28:23,495
If he keeps this up,
they'll shut us out.

482
00:28:23,568 --> 00:28:27,026
- In ten.
- I got to go.

483
00:28:27,105 --> 00:28:31,804
From our Houston bureau where Emmett
Seaborn is following that story.

484
00:28:31,877 --> 00:28:36,041
The astronauts of Apollo 13
face new uncertainties...

485
00:28:36,114 --> 00:28:39,811
as they prepare for tomorrow's fiery
descent through the Earth's atmosphere.

486
00:28:39,885 --> 00:28:42,854
The first big test
will come early tomorrow...

487
00:28:42,921 --> 00:28:45,355
when the crew brings Odyssey's
electrical systems...

488
00:28:45,424 --> 00:28:48,689
- What do I say to him?
- Just tell him it's the assignment.

489
00:28:50,128 --> 00:28:51,857
I don't think it's gonna wash.

490
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:53,727
Don't worry about it.

491
00:28:58,203 --> 00:29:01,798
- When do you think we'll know that?
- We should know that in a few hours.

492
00:29:01,873 --> 00:29:03,306
Thanks, Emmett.

493
00:29:03,375 --> 00:29:05,866
- And we're clear.
- And we're out.

494
00:29:08,714 --> 00:29:12,707
New York would like you
to stay in the studio tomorrow.

495
00:29:12,784 --> 00:29:15,048
- Here?
- Yeah.

496
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,418
They think it would be better if you
were holding down the fort here...

497
00:29:17,489 --> 00:29:22,119
and if Brett or somebody fed the descent
reports into you from Mission Control.

498
00:29:22,194 --> 00:29:24,754
Feeds them to me?
Who's on air?

499
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:28,129
- You both are, but...
- Then he feeds them to New York.

500
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:31,169
That's where the show originates.

501
00:29:31,236 --> 00:29:32,726
What am I doing?

502
00:29:33,805 --> 00:29:36,239
Providing perspective.

503
00:29:41,346 --> 00:29:43,280
You could take it up
with New York.

504
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:47,384
I shouldn't have to beg.

505
00:30:09,107 --> 00:30:13,635
Aquarius, Houston.

506
00:30:14,713 --> 00:30:16,738
Go ahead.

507
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:19,079
Okay, here's the big story.

508
00:30:19,151 --> 00:30:21,119
Your attitude looks good
except in rolls...

509
00:30:21,186 --> 00:30:23,984
so we'd like you
to do the following:

510
00:30:24,055 --> 00:30:27,752
In minimal impulse pings,
we'd like you to trim to zero pitch...

511
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:29,726
which is about where you are now...

512
00:30:29,795 --> 00:30:32,263
to 008 degrees in roll...

513
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:36,289
which is about 16 degrees
from your present roll attitude...

514
00:30:36,368 --> 00:30:40,464
and to zero degrees in yaw,
which is about where you are now.

515
00:30:40,539 --> 00:30:45,306
We'd like you to do the body
access align 400 plus 5-400...

516
00:30:45,377 --> 00:30:47,470
Could you help me?
I'm not sure...

517
00:30:50,048 --> 00:30:52,016
How does that sound? Over.

518
00:30:53,118 --> 00:30:55,552
Are you saying
I'm rolled the wrong way?

519
00:30:57,455 --> 00:30:59,650
That's right, Jim.
I'm sorry.

520
00:31:04,729 --> 00:31:08,665
Apollo 13 is 45,000 miles
from Earth...

521
00:31:08,733 --> 00:31:11,600
and moving at 7,000 miles an hour.

522
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:15,003
Its course now adjusted so we should
see it land in the Pacific...

523
00:31:15,073 --> 00:31:17,405
some five hours from now.

524
00:31:17,475 --> 00:31:21,775
The helicopter carrier lwo Jima
is on station there.

525
00:31:21,847 --> 00:31:24,714
The weather,
which has been on-again, off-again...

526
00:31:24,783 --> 00:31:26,614
is now on again.

527
00:31:26,685 --> 00:31:29,882
Some of the spacecraft's most critical
moments are approaching.

528
00:31:29,955 --> 00:31:33,516
In about 20 minutes,
at 7:23 Houston time...

529
00:31:33,592 --> 00:31:36,925
the astronauts will jettison
their crippled service module.

530
00:31:36,995 --> 00:31:41,125
At 10:53,
they will cast off the lunar lander...

531
00:31:41,199 --> 00:31:44,896
that has been their lifeboat ever since
the power failed on the main ship...

532
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:47,598
some 82 hours ago.

533
00:31:47,672 --> 00:31:52,371
What we don't know in the final hours
of this extraordinary mission...

534
00:31:52,444 --> 00:31:55,208
is how the damaged spacecraft
will stand up to the trauma...

535
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,748
of re-entry
into the Earth's atmosphere.

536
00:31:57,816 --> 00:32:00,216
How do we tell whether
the heat shield's been damaged?

537
00:32:00,285 --> 00:32:02,981
Drop it through the atmosphere
and see if they survive.

538
00:32:03,054 --> 00:32:06,956
Were Odyssey's heat shields
damaged by the explosion?

539
00:32:07,025 --> 00:32:09,550
Will the pyrotechnics
that deploy the parachutes...

540
00:32:09,628 --> 00:32:11,061
needed to slow the capsule...

541
00:32:11,129 --> 00:32:13,461
from a fatal 300 miles an hour...

542
00:32:13,531 --> 00:32:17,661
to a gentle 20 for splashdown
function properly?

543
00:32:17,736 --> 00:32:20,705
We're getting word from Brett Hutchins
that the astronauts...

544
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:22,433
are about to jettison
the service module.

545
00:32:22,507 --> 00:32:25,965
- Yes, Howard. That procedure...
- Let's go directly to Brett.

546
00:32:26,044 --> 00:32:28,512
- We'll get it from the source.
- Thank you, Howard.

547
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:32,539
In just a few minutes, the astronauts
aboard the crippled Apollo 13...

548
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:34,551
will jettison their service module...

549
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:37,884
which was mysteriously damaged
only two days into the mission...

550
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:40,925
forcing them to abandon all hopes
of a lunar landing.

551
00:32:40,992 --> 00:32:43,688
With any luck, the crew will get a view
of the damaged service module...

552
00:32:43,762 --> 00:32:46,629
to determine what may have caused
the cataclysmic malfunction.

553
00:32:58,443 --> 00:33:01,537
- Are we icing Brett Hutchins?
- You bet.

554
00:33:01,613 --> 00:33:03,205
Don't.

555
00:33:03,281 --> 00:33:06,944
We have rules. We can't reward someone
for breaking them.

556
00:33:07,018 --> 00:33:09,953
We can't afford
to alienate a network.

557
00:33:13,692 --> 00:33:15,455
This is Apollo Control Houston...

558
00:33:15,527 --> 00:33:19,657
at 140 hours, 15 minutes
into the mission.

559
00:33:19,731 --> 00:33:25,499
Apollo 13 presently 34,350
nautical miles out from the Earth...

560
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:30,769
traveling at a speed
of 12,846 miles per hour.

561
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:35,108
Meanwhile, in the Mission Control
viewing room, the crowd is increasing.

562
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:37,808
Already here are
Senator Phil Hart of Michigan...

563
00:33:37,882 --> 00:33:40,976
Chairman of the Senate Select Committee
on Science and Technology...

564
00:33:41,052 --> 00:33:44,544
California Representative George Miller,
Chairman of the House Space Committee...

565
00:33:44,622 --> 00:33:46,556
For the post-mission
press conference...

566
00:33:46,624 --> 00:33:48,319
the senator will make
the opening statement.

567
00:33:48,393 --> 00:33:51,988
The congressman's been more closely
identified with the program.

568
00:33:52,063 --> 00:33:54,793
- You have absolutely no shame, Fred.
- Gentlemen.

569
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:58,700
Sorry, boys. Administrator Paine
should make the opening...

570
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:04,368
If they don't make it through re-entry,
who wants to go first?

571
00:34:04,442 --> 00:34:08,003
Okay, Houston.
Do we have a go for pyro arm?

572
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,738
Stand by for a go on pyro arm
and LEM jettison.

573
00:34:12,851 --> 00:34:17,413
The astronauts are about to jettison the
lifeboat that has served them so well.

574
00:34:17,489 --> 00:34:20,083
Are there any dangers
in this maneuver?

575
00:34:20,158 --> 00:34:22,649
This is a moment of high suspense
for the astronauts...

576
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:26,424
their families and everyone
on the ground at Mission Control.

577
00:34:26,498 --> 00:34:29,194
Just answer the goddamn question!

578
00:34:29,267 --> 00:34:31,599
...reverse thrusters
to back them away from the LEM.

579
00:34:31,669 --> 00:34:36,231
They've wanted to hold onto their
LEM lifeboat for as long as possible.

580
00:34:36,307 --> 00:34:39,037
The SCC's logic is on.

581
00:34:40,345 --> 00:34:41,812
Just copied that.

582
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:44,940
You are go for pyro arm,
go for LEM jettison.

583
00:34:46,484 --> 00:34:48,714
Real fine.
Ten seconds.

584
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:54,023
Five.

585
00:34:55,326 --> 00:34:58,420
- LEM jettisoned.
- Okay, that was the LEM.

586
00:34:58,496 --> 00:35:01,659
- At 141:30 ground elapsed time.
- Copy that. Farewell, Aquarius...

587
00:35:01,733 --> 00:35:03,667
10:43 a.m. Yeah.

588
00:35:03,735 --> 00:35:09,537
Quote this: "Farewell, Aquarius,
and we thank you." Yeah.

589
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:11,472
This is Apollo Control...

590
00:35:11,543 --> 00:35:13,977
at 142 hours, 30 minutes.

591
00:35:14,045 --> 00:35:17,378
Apollo 13 is presently 6,000 miles
from Earth...

592
00:35:17,449 --> 00:35:20,976
traveling at a speed
of 25,000 miles per hour.

593
00:35:21,052 --> 00:35:24,351
Re-entry expected to begin
in ten minutes.

594
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:34,390
In four minutes, the leading edge
of the command module...

595
00:35:34,466 --> 00:35:36,400
will bite into the atmosphere.

596
00:35:36,468 --> 00:35:40,199
And, as the accelerating ship
encounters the thickening air...

597
00:35:40,271 --> 00:35:42,239
friction will begin to build...

598
00:35:42,307 --> 00:35:46,835
generating temperatures of 4,000 degrees
across the face of the heat shield.

599
00:35:46,911 --> 00:35:50,540
If this energy generated
by the infernal descent...

600
00:35:50,615 --> 00:35:52,708
were converted to electricity...

601
00:35:52,784 --> 00:35:55,878
it would equal
86,000 kilowatt hours...

602
00:35:55,954 --> 00:36:00,357
enough to light up Los Angeles
for one and a half minutes.

603
00:36:00,425 --> 00:36:03,758
If it were converted
to kinetic energy...

604
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:08,663
it could lift every man, woman and child
ten inches off the ground.

605
00:36:08,733 --> 00:36:11,133
For the craft, however,
it will have but one effect.

606
00:36:11,202 --> 00:36:16,003
As temperatures rise, a dense cloud
of ionized gas will surround the ship...

607
00:36:16,074 --> 00:36:20,511
reducing communication to a hash
of static for about three minutes.

608
00:36:20,578 --> 00:36:24,776
If radio contact is restored at the end
of this time, controllers will know...

609
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:26,942
that the heat shield is intact...

610
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:29,282
and the spacecraft did survive.

611
00:36:29,354 --> 00:36:34,018
If not, they will know that
the crew was consumed in flames.

612
00:36:34,092 --> 00:36:37,584
Odyssey, Houston. We just had
one last time around the room...

613
00:36:37,662 --> 00:36:40,495
and everybody says
you're looking great.

614
00:36:41,933 --> 00:36:44,561
I know all of us want to thank
all you guys down there...

615
00:36:44,636 --> 00:36:47,036
for the very fine job you did.

616
00:36:47,105 --> 00:36:49,596
That's the nicest thing
anybody's ever said.

617
00:36:49,674 --> 00:36:52,074
All right, LOS in about a minute
or a minute and a half.

618
00:36:52,143 --> 00:36:56,512
In entry attitude, we'd like
omni charlie. And welcome home.

619
00:36:56,581 --> 00:36:58,014
Thank you.

620
00:37:00,952 --> 00:37:04,649
Apollo 13 is re-entering the atmosphere.

621
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:08,783
We are awaiting reacquisition of signal
in approximately three minutes.

622
00:37:53,037 --> 00:37:56,029
Odyssey, Houston.
Standing by. Over.

623
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:28,200
- Okay, Joe.
- Okay, we read you, Jack.

624
00:38:28,273 --> 00:38:32,369
We're looking at the weather on TV.
It looks just as advertised: Real good.

625
00:38:32,443 --> 00:38:36,004
A remarkable end
to a four-day ordeal...

626
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,547
as the astronauts streak homeward...

627
00:38:37,615 --> 00:38:41,608
We still have to wait for the drogue
chutes and the main parachutes.

628
00:38:41,686 --> 00:38:43,119
They could have been damaged...

629
00:38:43,187 --> 00:38:45,985
by exposure to low temperatures
when the heating elements...

630
00:38:46,057 --> 00:38:47,957
were powered down.

631
00:38:48,026 --> 00:38:50,290
I guess it's not over
till it's over.

632
00:38:50,361 --> 00:38:53,387
The Soviets learned that
almost three years ago...

633
00:38:53,464 --> 00:38:57,366
when the parachute of their Soyuz 1
capsule failed to open...

634
00:38:57,435 --> 00:39:01,462
and Cosmonaut Vladimir Komarov
was killed on impact.

635
00:39:01,539 --> 00:39:04,030
Jesus. Anything make him happy?

636
00:39:04,108 --> 00:39:06,338
He's just filling air.

637
00:39:28,599 --> 00:39:30,499
We've got a couple
of good drogues.

638
00:39:36,674 --> 00:39:38,107
There go the mains.

639
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:22,046
Emmett, it looks good from here.
What do you think?

640
00:40:23,955 --> 00:40:28,892
I think it's the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

641
00:40:44,175 --> 00:40:45,802
Houston, this is Odyssey.

642
00:40:45,877 --> 00:40:48,038
We're in stable one,
the ship is secure...

643
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:50,307
and our buoyancy's holding.

644
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:55,047
What did we learn?

645
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:57,053
Perhaps the limits of technology...

646
00:40:57,121 --> 00:41:01,421
at least when it comes
to protecting us from our own hubris.

647
00:41:01,492 --> 00:41:04,188
But those are issues
for another day.

648
00:41:04,262 --> 00:41:06,958
What matters now is that
three great men...

649
00:41:07,031 --> 00:41:10,228
are safely aboard
the USS lwo Jima...

650
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:12,394
and steaming for home.

651
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:15,200
In Houston,
this is Emmett Seaborn.

652
00:41:15,606 --> 00:41:17,540
- Thank you, Emmett.
- We're clear.

653
00:41:19,444 --> 00:41:21,173
I'm getting too old for this.

654
00:41:21,245 --> 00:41:23,543
- Good job.
- Thanks.

655
00:41:37,895 --> 00:41:40,523
That was a hell of a job.
Could we talk...

656
00:41:40,598 --> 00:41:44,227
I've been promised the first
post-mission interview with Gene Kranz.

657
00:41:44,302 --> 00:41:46,862
If I was at Mission Control
instead of here...

658
00:41:46,938 --> 00:41:50,032
I'd be doing it right now,
instead of a half hour from now.

659
00:41:50,107 --> 00:41:51,540
You get it?

660
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:58,048
I get it, all right.

661
00:42:00,651 --> 00:42:03,142
- Where the hell were you?
- At our downtown spa.

662
00:42:03,221 --> 00:42:05,052
- Mr. Seaborn.
- Where is he?

663
00:42:05,122 --> 00:42:07,556
- Who?
- Gene to me, Mr. Kranz to you.

664
00:42:07,625 --> 00:42:11,584
- We're setting up in a VIP room...
- Let's go.

665
00:42:27,845 --> 00:42:29,278
Sorry.

666
00:42:31,349 --> 00:42:33,647
You getting too big for me now?

667
00:42:33,718 --> 00:42:38,451
- Congratulations, Gene. Hell of a job.
- Thank you, sir.

668
00:42:39,957 --> 00:42:43,085
- What are you doing here?
- Huh?

669
00:42:46,497 --> 00:42:48,965
Yeah, they told me
you were staying downtown.

670
00:42:53,004 --> 00:42:54,437
Who told you that?

671
00:43:03,114 --> 00:43:06,811
Heck, you're here.
Why not let the A team take over?

672
00:43:23,534 --> 00:43:26,059
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Yes?

673
00:43:27,838 --> 00:43:29,271
Look, Emmett...

674
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:32,639
if it's a problem,
you can do the interview.

675
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:34,803
I don't mind.

676
00:43:40,952 --> 00:43:42,749
No, it's okay.

677
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:44,253
I...

678
00:43:46,324 --> 00:43:47,916
I got work to do.
