1
00:02:14,295 --> 00:02:15,965
Champagne?

2
00:02:21,494 --> 00:02:24,655
Sorry.
Bubbles...went up my nose.

3
00:02:27,404 --> 00:02:30,050
Actually, that's not technically champagne.
That's Cava.

4
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:33,932
It's a Spanish sparkling wine and uses 
the champenoise process.  It um...

5
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:38,061
Nevermind.

6
00:02:40,546 --> 00:02:42,794
<i>Is it there?</i>
One porcelain vase.

7
00:02:42,982 --> 00:02:46,486
Early Ming dynasty, circa 1400
Lot 011.

8
00:02:46,827 --> 00:02:50,248
Lot 0-1-1.

9
00:02:50,533 --> 00:02:54,211
<i>And Mason?</i>
He's here and he brought a friend.

10
00:02:55,131 --> 00:02:56,896
A very big friend.

11
00:02:57,176 --> 00:03:00,892
Whatever it takes, do not
let him leave with that vase.

12
00:03:01,079 --> 00:03:02,968
Check.  Save the world, no matter what.

13
00:03:03,116 --> 00:03:04,435
As long as you don't go over budget.

14
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:08,211
Next up, ladies and genetlemen,
a porcelain vase.

15
00:03:08,426 --> 00:03:11,854
Early Ming dynasty, circa 1400.

16
00:03:12,269 --> 00:03:15,709
May I have a starting bid of 20,000 pounds?

17
00:03:16,392 --> 00:03:19,567
20,000. Do I hear 30,000?

18
00:03:19,747 --> 00:03:22,690
<i>30,000. Thank you sir.
30,000 is the bid.</i>

19
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,664
<i>Do I hear 40? Looking 40...
40,000 to the lady.</i>

20
00:03:26,987 --> 00:03:29,110
30,000 is in the budget.

21
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,779
I'm officially upset now, Flynn

22
00:03:33,206 --> 00:03:36,425
Oh hey, Katie...everything okay?

23
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:39,641
We were supposed to meet for 
lunch an hour ago. Where are you?

24
00:03:40,035 --> 00:03:41,715
I...I'm still at the, uh...

25
00:03:43,355 --> 00:03:44,858
Flynn?

26
00:03:45,084 --> 00:03:47,480
I'm at the librarian convention.
The online catalog seminar ran over. 

27
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:51,248
You know how it is. You get a bunch of 
librarians in a room talking and...

28
00:03:51,427 --> 00:03:55,543
In the last six months we that we've
been dating, you've given a hundred excuses.

29
00:03:55,774 --> 00:03:57,110
Oh come on, a hundred?

30
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:02,697
That will be 100,000 pounds!
<i>You're always late.</i>

31
00:04:02,891 --> 00:04:05,199
<i>150?  150,000 pounds!</i>
Slow down.

32
00:04:05,751 --> 00:04:08,595
<i>You're running off to some 
convention or book club retreat.</i>

33
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,504
I brought you to England.

34
00:04:10,785 --> 00:04:14,471
And since we've gotten off the plane,
you left me waiting a dozen times.

35
00:04:15,367 --> 00:04:17,840
- I have to take that...
- Don't you take that call!

36
00:04:18,287 --> 00:04:20,812
Are you trying to bankrupt us?

37
00:04:21,015 --> 00:04:23,071
I can't really talk to you right now,
Charlene, I've got Katie on the other line.

38
00:04:23,277 --> 00:04:25,556
- Is Katie writing your checks?
- Give me five minutes, okay?

39
00:04:25,782 --> 00:04:27,621
- Don't you hang up!
- Just give me five minutes!

40
00:04:27,865 --> 00:04:30,133
I have 500,000 pounds!

41
00:04:30,422 --> 00:04:33,267
<i>Flynn...Flynn?</i>
- Wait. Wait...wh..
- 500,000

42
00:04:33,527 --> 00:04:35,152
550.

43
00:04:35,454 --> 00:04:40,660
Maybe some women are okay with the wild and
unpredictable lifestyle of dating a librarian

44
00:04:41,661 --> 00:04:43,038
but I'm not.

45
00:04:43,226 --> 00:04:44,519
600. 650.

46
00:04:44,706 --> 00:04:47,738
750. 850. I have 850.

47
00:04:47,938 --> 00:04:50,025
850,000 is the standing bid.

48
00:04:50,217 --> 00:04:52,411
<i>I want someone I can depend on.</i>

49
00:04:54,621 --> 00:04:56,547
Flynn, I'm leaving.

50
00:04:56,821 --> 00:05:01,567
Don't leave. I'll meet you in 15 minutes 
in the hotel bar. 15 minutes in the hotel 
bar. Don't leave.

51
00:05:01,817 --> 00:05:03,978
Please don't let me down again, Flynn.

52
00:05:04,259 --> 00:05:06,544
One million pounds!

53
00:05:15,601 --> 00:05:19,430
Sold! To the impatient American
for one million pounds!

54
00:05:35,202 --> 00:05:36,988
Charlene?

55
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:44,004
And...let's wait about two weeks
before cashing that check, shall we?

56
00:05:44,353 --> 00:05:50,935
Yes, such a pleasure to find somebody
who understands the unique value and 
rarity of such a fine artifact.

57
00:05:52,921 --> 00:05:54,765
What are...what are you...

58
00:05:55,669 --> 00:05:57,553
What is that?

59
00:05:58,025 --> 00:06:00,733
That is the Philosopher's Stone.

60
00:06:01,048 --> 00:06:05,082
The most powerful and famous
transmutational relic in all of history

61
00:06:06,169 --> 00:06:07,389
What does that mean?

62
00:06:07,593 --> 00:06:11,558
It means that the stone can turn
anything it touches into gold.

63
00:06:13,004 --> 00:06:15,104
Mr. Carsen, we meet again.

64
00:06:15,494 --> 00:06:19,701
Very valuable, as you can imagine, but also
quite dangerous if you're not careful.

65
00:06:20,872 --> 00:06:25,686
My Bodyguard, Mr. Percy once had the
misfortune of holding the stone

66
00:06:25,876 --> 00:06:27,992
without taking the necessary precautions.

67
00:06:28,204 --> 00:06:30,946
Well gentlemen, this is all very 
fascinating, but my girlfriend is waiting...

68
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:37,362
I don't mean to be "heavy handed" [laughs]

69
00:06:39,055 --> 00:06:43,931
<i>Get it?
Because his hand is made of gold.</i>

70
00:06:56,212 --> 00:06:57,861
Carsen...

71
00:06:59,789 --> 00:07:02,144
I want that stone!

72
00:07:08,278 --> 00:07:10,970
- That's 18th century Korean.
- Sorry.

73
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:30,634
British Cavalry sword.  Silver filigree.

74
00:07:30,933 --> 00:07:32,313
Bit overpriced.

75
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:43,218
- This is rented!
- Of course it is.

76
00:07:58,754 --> 00:08:02,282
- You know you're going to lose, Flynn.
- Actually, I know two things.

77
00:08:02,487 --> 00:08:08,848
Your sword grip and tactics show me that
you're fighting with a German 14th century
sword style developed by Johannes Liechtenauer

78
00:08:09,824 --> 00:08:13,654
Defeated only by the Renaissance technique 
taught by Hutton in 1892.

79
00:08:14,082 --> 00:08:15,665
What's the other thing you know?

80
00:08:15,848 --> 00:08:19,274
The Renaissance style taught
by Hutton in 1892.

81
00:08:27,811 --> 00:08:30,141
Katie, I'm here! I know...
Excuse me, sir.

82
00:08:30,332 --> 00:08:32,798
I'm a little late.
I'm a lot late.

83
00:08:34,816 --> 00:08:37,668
Hi. I'm looking for my girlfriend.

84
00:08:37,848 --> 00:08:40,037
She has blonde hair, and she's American.

85
00:08:40,213 --> 00:08:45,402
Would she have had a lingering air of 
disappointment as if she just made a 
difficult, but necessary, decision?

86
00:08:45,585 --> 00:08:48,480
Yeah? Yeah. That's her.

87
00:08:48,669 --> 00:08:51,955
She left for the airport half an hour ago.
This is for you.

88
00:10:07,637 --> 00:10:13,893
No, no, no, no. I understand he wrote you the 
check, but he was not authorized for that amount

89
00:10:15,522 --> 00:10:18,509
Perhaps if we return the va--

90
00:10:19,554 --> 00:10:21,706
How many pieces?

91
00:10:22,644 --> 00:10:26,112
We have some very cutting-edge
glue here at the library...

92
00:10:27,846 --> 00:10:30,521
I'll call you back.
Flynn!

93
00:10:33,923 --> 00:10:37,605
- One million pounds?
- Please Charlene, not today. I'm not in the mood.

94
00:10:37,817 --> 00:10:41,184
Oh fine.  I'll just deduct it from 
your pay for the next 50 years.

95
00:10:41,382 --> 00:10:45,730
Did the auctioneer happen to mention that 
I gave him a solid gold throw pillow 
worth about 2 million pounds?

96
00:10:45,965 --> 00:10:47,242
No.

97
00:10:47,452 --> 00:10:53,328
Well, here. Rub a quarter on the Philosopher's
Stone and you get instant gold.

98
00:10:54,103 --> 00:10:58,518
What has gotten into you? We just 
do not profit from the artifacts.

99
00:10:59,313 --> 00:11:03,275
- And this tuxedo, it's a rental.
- Hi Chris. Not today Charlene.

100
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:17,925
- Where's Judson?
- Is in the Large Collection Annex.

101
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:26,264
We have a "Large Collections" area?

102
00:11:36,615 --> 00:11:38,592
Charlene, how big is the library?

103
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:41,596
As big as we need it to be.

104
00:11:49,032 --> 00:11:51,669
Noah's Ark!
<i>Flynn!</i>

105
00:11:54,182 --> 00:11:55,853
<i>Flynn!</i>

106
00:11:57,237 --> 00:11:59,035
Welcome back, Flynn.

107
00:12:00,817 --> 00:12:02,549
Listen, Judson, I need...

108
00:12:03,011 --> 00:12:06,604
Judson? Judson?

109
00:12:06,829 --> 00:12:11,278
Oh, it's the Fountain of Youth.  It just 
arrived from St Augustine, Florida.

110
00:12:12,904 --> 00:12:15,539
I'm just testing it to make 
sure it's the real deal.

111
00:12:16,434 --> 00:12:17,916
Aah, that's better.

112
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,376
I'd hate to go through puberty again.

113
00:12:21,515 --> 00:12:25,320
- So, did you find Philosopher's Stone?
- Yes.

114
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,337
Ask him how much it cost.

115
00:12:28,556 --> 00:12:31,421
Excellent work.  Well I...
I knew you'd come through for us.

116
00:12:31,744 --> 00:12:35,321
That's why I know we can count
on you for this next job.

117
00:12:35,547 --> 00:12:38,723
Next job?
I just got back.

118
00:12:38,983 --> 00:12:42,716
We just received the Voynich manuscript
from Yale.  It's on loan.

119
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:45,618
It has to be deciphered by morning.

120
00:12:45,836 --> 00:12:48,280
- Well, I need to leave early today.
- Oh, not today.

121
00:12:48,482 --> 00:12:50,998
Yes, today, because my personal life...

122
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:55,872
Oh, that's right.  I'd forgotten, Monday
is your training day with Excalibur.

123
00:12:58,641 --> 00:12:59,759
He missed you.

124
00:13:00,039 --> 00:13:02,484
Well, I've already had my sword
practice for the week.

125
00:13:03,396 --> 00:13:06,235
Yeah, you're probably going to have
to spend the night, so we have a cot

126
00:13:07,538 --> 00:13:09,816
All right!  Stop it!  All of you!

127
00:13:11,008 --> 00:13:13,317
Flynn?  Are you all right?

128
00:13:13,515 --> 00:13:16,762
Yeah, I'm fine.  No, I'm good.
What could possibly be wrong?

129
00:13:17,112 --> 00:13:21,253
I mean, I work in a basement doing a
secret job I can't even tell my mother about.

130
00:13:21,635 --> 00:13:25,514
And...my best friend is a sword!
What could possibly be wrong?

131
00:13:26,322 --> 00:13:28,437
I think he's snapped.

132
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:31,678
Flynn, you're scaring the relics.

133
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:35,626
This place is sucking the life out of me!

134
00:13:36,572 --> 00:13:39,136
I looked around, I don't even see relics
anymore.  You know what I see?

135
00:13:39,453 --> 00:13:44,336
I see the parts of my life that I
have given up finding them!

136
00:13:44,766 --> 00:13:47,325
Blackbeard's Chest: my mom's 65th birthday.

137
00:13:47,509 --> 00:13:49,897
Da Vinci's Diary: my 10 year college reunion!

138
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:53,010
Do you even know how often 
those come along?

139
00:13:55,457 --> 00:13:58,168
Um...10 years?

140
00:13:59,474 --> 00:14:04,647
Valentine Day with my gir...
With my ex-girlfriend.

141
00:14:06,153 --> 00:14:09,784
- Oh...The girlfriend.
- It's always about the girl.

142
00:14:11,284 --> 00:14:15,485
Do you know that since I've been 
working here, I have not been in 
a relationship with a woman

143
00:14:15,909 --> 00:14:18,137
that has lasted more than six months?

144
00:14:18,366 --> 00:14:21,826
Didn't work out with Emily, didn't work out 
with Nicole, and now, Katie dumps me.

145
00:14:22,309 --> 00:14:24,139
And I really thought that she was...

146
00:14:27,057 --> 00:14:29,072
I thought that she might be the one.

147
00:14:29,315 --> 00:14:31,369
Flynn I'm sorry, but ...

148
00:14:31,804 --> 00:14:37,657
The Librarian, it isn't just a job.
It's...it's your life.

149
00:14:38,562 --> 00:14:42,981
Librarians and relationships...
Look, maybe this will help.

150
00:14:43,943 --> 00:14:49,185
Just think of yourself as 
a celibate monk.

151
00:14:50,986 --> 00:14:53,530
- We do.
- Sounds good.

152
00:14:54,749 --> 00:14:57,727
Good pep talk.
ARE YOU INSANE?

153
00:14:58,094 --> 00:15:00,843
I am 33 years old!

154
00:15:01,162 --> 00:15:04,571
Celibate a monk?  Celibate Monk?
Excalibur...

155
00:15:06,672 --> 00:15:09,366
Do it!  Do it now!
Just get it over with.

156
00:15:09,725 --> 00:15:17,276
Flynn look, you're..uh...you're overworked.
Maybe you should...maybe you should take 
some, you know, take some time off.

157
00:15:17,452 --> 00:15:20,901
You have some vacation pay coming.
But don't get greedy.

158
00:15:27,129 --> 00:15:28,401
Vacation?

159
00:15:30,621 --> 00:15:32,708
Vacation?

160
00:15:35,069 --> 00:15:38,209
Yeah.  Okay.

161
00:15:40,186 --> 00:15:42,282
Vacation.

162
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,178
Do you think he'll come back?

163
00:15:49,398 --> 00:15:52,769
He'll come back, the library 
has plans for him.

164
00:15:53,137 --> 00:15:57,149
Prince Vlad Dracul.
This is his insignia.

165
00:15:57,749 --> 00:15:59,764
Order of the dragon.

166
00:16:00,535 --> 00:16:06,307
Vlad was prince of Walachia
in the 15th century.

167
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:08,800
He was noted to his cruelty.

168
00:16:09,024 --> 00:16:12,370
over 40,000 people were
tortured and murdered

169
00:16:12,536 --> 00:16:14,507
during his brief six year reign.

170
00:16:14,755 --> 00:16:19,640
His favorite method of execution 
was impailment on a six-foot stake.

171
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:23,649
Hence, he earned the nickname
Vlad The Impailer.

172
00:16:23,855 --> 00:16:26,749
Was Dracul a vampire, professor?

173
00:16:27,259 --> 00:16:28,872
Vampire?  No.

174
00:16:29,897 --> 00:16:31,881
No, I don't think so.

175
00:16:32,337 --> 00:16:40,709
No.  No, the bloodlust fed the rumors 
from his enemies, and also his name is

176
00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:44,646
Dracula, meaning son of the 
dragon - son of the devil.

177
00:16:45,283 --> 00:16:48,617
But now, he's a moldering corpse somewhere

178
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:50,691
in those mountains, I'm sure...

179
00:16:51,617 --> 00:16:54,044
...a skeleton, like any other.

180
00:16:54,225 --> 00:16:56,241
Well, that's all the time we 
have for this evening.

181
00:16:56,413 --> 00:17:01,195
We will see you this time next week.
<i>For now, be young.</i>

182
00:17:10,436 --> 00:17:14,805
I enjoyed lecture, professor.
Very informative.

183
00:17:17,723 --> 00:17:21,900
2000 years Romanian history, all they 
want to know about is the vampires.

184
00:17:23,133 --> 00:17:25,845
Dracula always was Best Seller.

185
00:17:26,612 --> 00:17:28,713
Where do I know your face?

186
00:17:28,974 --> 00:17:32,893
My work has attracted a lot
of attention lately.

187
00:17:33,063 --> 00:17:38,412
Kubichek.  You recently resigned as
Security Minister from the Russian government.

188
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:42,328
Not as much fun as your old
days in the KGB, I suppose.

189
00:17:42,475 --> 00:17:44,648
Haven't you heard, 
there's no more KGB?

190
00:17:45,429 --> 00:17:47,794
No more Russia, really.

191
00:17:48,339 --> 00:17:55,027
That government is a sham.  I'm going 
to do something about that.  We are 
going to do something about that.

192
00:17:55,503 --> 00:17:57,165
What do you need from me?

193
00:17:57,387 --> 00:18:02,126
He wasn't in synagogue.  We found him 
much further south, in the Carpathians.

194
00:18:02,509 --> 00:18:04,302
You've found the body?

195
00:18:07,925 --> 00:18:13,234
I'd remembered we had two scrolls we had 
taken from Nazis that were in turn stolen

196
00:18:13,538 --> 00:18:18,377
from a monastary in France.  I went 
into old files and found them.

197
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:23,312
This one is map to Dracul's body.

198
00:18:24,382 --> 00:18:28,710
And this one provides clues to 
where the French monks hid this.

199
00:18:30,996 --> 00:18:34,717
No.  No.  This is a hoax.  I've 
searched for this my entire life.

200
00:18:35,127 --> 00:18:36,752
It's real.

201
00:18:37,013 --> 00:18:39,643
And you're going to help us find it.

202
00:18:40,389 --> 00:18:42,938
The Judas Chalice.

203
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:49,165
Flynn, open up, it's Charlene.

204
00:18:58,082 --> 00:18:59,400
What are you doing here?

205
00:19:00,165 --> 00:19:05,741
Well, my combination speed dating / 
wine tasting was two streets down.

206
00:19:06,164 --> 00:19:08,661
- How did that go?
- Here.

207
00:19:11,753 --> 00:19:14,820
This is how you spend your free
time, couped up in your apartment?

208
00:19:15,024 --> 00:19:17,545
Yeah, just catching up on some reading.

209
00:19:18,756 --> 00:19:21,269
Yeah.  You, of all people, 
don't read enough.

210
00:19:21,501 --> 00:19:25,559
I've also discovered this 
new online poker game

211
00:19:25,771 --> 00:19:27,461
which is really amazing. 
By using binomial

212
00:19:27,665 --> 00:19:31,210
coefficients and probability
theories, I've been able to 
correctly guess the cards

213
00:19:31,439 --> 00:19:32,843
73% of the time.  I have won

214
00:19:33,058 --> 00:19:36,408
over 25,000 virtual dollars.

215
00:19:36,609 --> 00:19:38,480
I'm virtually proud of you.

216
00:19:38,742 --> 00:19:42,172
You have time off.
Get out of this apartment.

217
00:19:43,627 --> 00:19:47,283
I just...I don't feel like it right now.

218
00:19:47,588 --> 00:19:52,928
Look, these are travel brochures 
for vacations I never took.

219
00:19:53,117 --> 00:19:55,002
So, don't do what I did.

220
00:19:55,182 --> 00:19:57,704
Here.  You could go to the Grand Canyon.

221
00:19:57,877 --> 00:20:00,193
You know 7 people fall off the
Grand Canyon every year?

222
00:20:00,958 --> 00:20:04,093
- Wine tasting in Sonoma.
- Wine goes bad.

223
00:20:04,402 --> 00:20:07,501
Just get out of here.  Go to 
Las Vegas.  New Orleans.

224
00:20:07,526 --> 00:20:10,009
And what if New Orleans dumps me?

225
00:20:10,325 --> 00:20:13,314
The city of New Orleans will dump you?

226
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:21,027
I just...I don't want to get my hopes up on 
something new and then be disappointed

227
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:23,629
And then lose.  Again.

228
00:20:24,481 --> 00:20:29,086
Look.
I'm sorry about Katie.

229
00:20:29,747 --> 00:20:34,235
But you can't get stuck,
you gotta move on to new things

230
00:20:34,385 --> 00:20:35,699
to a new someone.

231
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:37,823
And when I lose the next someone?

232
00:20:38,185 --> 00:20:41,458
You're not the only one this job has cost.

233
00:20:41,658 --> 00:20:44,399
You know my marriage broke
up right before we met.

234
00:20:44,588 --> 00:20:48,934
No, I'm not saying my time with
Gaston was bad or wasted

235
00:20:49,211 --> 00:20:53,083
but sometimes saying goodbye
is the right thing to do

236
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:58,454
Keep on living.
Follow the dream.

237
00:20:59,126 --> 00:21:00,834
See where it leads ya.

238
00:21:01,597 --> 00:21:04,399
- This old?
- Yeah.

239
00:21:07,649 --> 00:21:10,347
Um...you're uh...
You're not driving, are you?

240
00:21:10,761 --> 00:21:12,666
No, I got the bike.

241
00:22:26,742 --> 00:22:28,450
Follow the dream.

242
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,744
<i>All aboard.  All aboard.</i>

243
00:22:43,901 --> 00:22:48,933
And I got my cab right out front and 
my cousin Boudreaux, he got a hotel, 
and I can give you a cut rate if...

244
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:52,241
- A little help here.
- Hey, welcome to the Big Easy

245
00:22:52,608 --> 00:22:53,881
Thank you very much.

246
00:22:54,207 --> 00:22:57,930
Laissez les bon temps roulez.
Let the good times roll.

247
00:22:58,768 --> 00:23:00,995
Boy, it is good to have 
tourists back in the city.

248
00:23:01,691 --> 00:23:02,845
I look like a tourist?

249
00:23:03,036 --> 00:23:05,174
Mon ami, You look like THE tourist.  Come on.

250
00:23:05,507 --> 00:23:06,973
We take my cab.

251
00:23:07,231 --> 00:23:09,584
- You here on business or pleasure?
- Pleasure.

252
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,279
Aw then, you in luck because 
pleasure is my business.

253
00:23:15,656 --> 00:23:19,046
Eh, name's Andre.
Number's on the back.

254
00:23:19,229 --> 00:23:23,076
- Whatever you need, look no further
'cause I'm your man
- Aaw, thank you.

255
00:23:23,629 --> 00:23:28,453
You want some good 'ol creole cooking? My 
cousin Joe got the best restaurant in the city.

256
00:23:30,086 --> 00:23:33,422
Night life?  You can't beat my cousin
Dupree's jazz cafe.

257
00:23:34,009 --> 00:23:39,027
Fishing?  My cousin Earl got
the luckiest boat on the river.

258
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,265
- How many cousins do you have?
- How many you need?

259
00:23:43,291 --> 00:23:48,927
So, what is it?  Music?  
Booze?  Food?  Women?

260
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:51,306
Well, I thought I'd check 
out a few museums.

261
00:23:52,471 --> 00:23:56,819
Oh.  The museum.  Sure.

262
00:23:58,939 --> 00:24:01,587
You do realize you're in
New Orleans, right?

263
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:55,704
<i>This city is so romantic.</i>

264
00:26:59,536 --> 00:27:01,297
You sure it's in here?

265
00:27:01,956 --> 00:27:06,306
Yes, the scroll specifically says that 
the monks assigned a hiding place

266
00:27:06,464 --> 00:27:09,946
somewhere in the the old Capuccin monastery.

267
00:27:11,382 --> 00:27:14,107
They turn church into nightclub?

268
00:27:16,143 --> 00:27:19,762
Americans.
<i>Ivan, go.</i>

269
00:27:42,974 --> 00:27:44,748
Mind if I join you?

270
00:27:49,368 --> 00:27:52,986
Hi.  I'm Flynn.

271
00:27:53,406 --> 00:27:58,219
That performance was...wow.

272
00:28:00,196 --> 00:28:02,014
Can I buy you a drink?

273
00:28:03,239 --> 00:28:04,898
You already have a drink.

274
00:28:05,204 --> 00:28:09,645
This is gonna sound...it's gonna 
sound like a bad pickup line...but

275
00:28:12,453 --> 00:28:15,074
you're the woman I've been dreaming about.

276
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:20,565
You're right.
It does sound like a bad pickup line.

277
00:28:21,719 --> 00:28:25,035
I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.
<i>sorry...sorry...sorry</i>

278
00:28:25,784 --> 00:28:28,940
Yeah, I just got out of this relationship 
and I came down here to forget about everything

279
00:28:29,233 --> 00:28:30,684
I had this really crazy dream...and...

280
00:28:30,914 --> 00:28:36,479
- Let's go somewhere a little bit more private.
- Uh...yeah, sure.

281
00:28:46,768 --> 00:28:49,556
Are we in a rush?

282
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:53,326
Come, come.

283
00:29:01,576 --> 00:29:06,270
That is...definitely...
a fire hazard.

284
00:29:07,543 --> 00:29:10,651
Hazard?  Hazard?  [echoes]

285
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:13,275
It's an echo chamber.

286
00:29:13,469 --> 00:29:15,213
It's kind of a specialty 
of Eastern temples

287
00:29:15,399 --> 00:29:17,559
But a lot of Western monasteries 
use the same architectural design

288
00:29:17,866 --> 00:29:20,504
you see, stand...in the right spot

289
00:29:20,678 --> 00:29:23,475
and a single voice is amplified
into an entire chorus.

290
00:29:34,211 --> 00:29:36,175
Wow.  A little fast, huh?

291
00:29:37,262 --> 00:29:41,191
Don't you think we should open 
some music, or put on some wine

292
00:29:41,445 --> 00:29:44,006
or take a key from your thigh?

293
00:29:44,163 --> 00:29:46,065
It's okay, Librarian.

294
00:29:46,378 --> 00:29:50,544
You can drop the act.  You 
are very convincing as a 
hapless loser, by the way

295
00:29:51,523 --> 00:29:53,719
Librarian?
How did you...

296
00:29:54,330 --> 00:29:58,227
What do you mean, "hapless loser"?
No, no.  Go back to the Librarian part.

297
00:29:58,418 --> 00:30:00,240
- You are the Librarian.
- Yes.

298
00:30:00,469 --> 00:30:02,348
But I'm on vacation.
And how do you even...

299
00:30:02,516 --> 00:30:06,121
- I called you in your dreams.
- I knew you called me in my dream.

300
00:30:06,278 --> 00:30:08,908
This marker will tell you where to go next.
Now please hurry there is little

301
00:30:09,193 --> 00:30:12,093
time left, and the Librarian is the 
only one who can protect the Chalice.

302
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:15,174
Chalice?  What chalice?

303
00:30:15,715 --> 00:30:17,616
Are you talking about the Holy Grail?
We already have it.

304
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:20,135
About that big?  Made out of wood?

305
00:30:22,105 --> 00:30:23,817
Drop it!

306
00:30:25,025 --> 00:30:28,462
Kill them both
and bring the marker to me!

307
00:30:31,391 --> 00:30:35,669
First of all, I'm on vacation.

308
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:44,780
And second of all...
You...and you...and you...[echoes]

309
00:30:48,634 --> 00:30:54,073
- High C.  Now!
- This way.

310
00:30:58,568 --> 00:31:00,132
After them.

311
00:31:01,621 --> 00:31:03,299
This way.

312
00:31:19,303 --> 00:31:21,947
Okay, don't be nervous.
We're going to have to...

313
00:31:26,048 --> 00:31:28,485
Okay...

314
00:31:30,765 --> 00:31:35,334
160 lbs, 45-degree angle,
15 foot linear distance.

315
00:31:36,514 --> 00:31:38,402
Okay.  One, two ...

316
00:31:42,957 --> 00:31:45,906
Maybe 165 lbs.

317
00:31:57,171 --> 00:31:59,836
Who are these people?

318
00:32:09,089 --> 00:32:10,299
Where is it?

319
00:32:10,524 --> 00:32:13,926
There were two thieves here 
when we arrived.  They, um

320
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:17,531
escaped with the marker.

321
00:32:17,743 --> 00:32:22,289
You fail me, you fail me,
YOU FAIL ME!

322
00:32:22,469 --> 00:32:26,585
Perhaps we don't need the marker.

323
00:32:41,433 --> 00:32:46,043
How did you know?  That I can hit a 
high C?  Not everyone can, you know.

324
00:32:46,347 --> 00:32:50,598
When you sang, I heard you use gladle 
stops indicative of a classical opera 
training technique

325
00:32:51,041 --> 00:32:53,105
Plus, you're a natural soprano, 
so the probability...

326
00:32:53,299 --> 00:32:56,125
Is that what it's like in 
your head all the time?

327
00:32:56,619 --> 00:33:02,508
Prety much.  Except for the screaming, 
when I'm being shot at.  Or when I'm 
falling a great distance.

328
00:33:05,003 --> 00:33:06,476
You read that?

329
00:33:07,107 --> 00:33:10,047
- You can't?
- No, I am just its guardian.

330
00:33:10,354 --> 00:33:12,408
You guard something that 
you don't understand.

331
00:33:12,596 --> 00:33:14,772
So says the Librarian.

332
00:33:15,424 --> 00:33:18,702
- Good point.  Who helps you?
- No one.

333
00:33:18,952 --> 00:33:22,075
I've been guarding the secret 
for most of my life by myself.

334
00:33:23,034 --> 00:33:24,881
That must get lonely.

335
00:33:25,089 --> 00:33:27,301
Again, so says the Librarian.

336
00:33:28,693 --> 00:33:30,682
You ever get sick of it?

337
00:33:30,915 --> 00:33:34,583
It's my destiny, you can not
escape your destiny, Flynn.

338
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:37,607
No, I was trying to take a vacation 
from it, but didn't seem to work out...

339
00:33:37,804 --> 00:33:42,529
No, if you fight your destiny 
you will be miserable.

340
00:33:42,748 --> 00:33:45,343
You must embrace it. 
And revel in every moment.

341
00:33:45,831 --> 00:33:47,601
Such as?

342
00:33:48,963 --> 00:33:50,277
- You save the treasure.
- Whatever that is.

343
00:33:50,492 --> 00:33:52,123
- And escape the bad guys.
- Whoever they are.

344
00:33:52,313 --> 00:33:54,616
- And rescue lady fair.
- I don't know about rescuing lady...

345
00:33:54,818 --> 00:33:57,530
And your heart is beating.

346
00:34:00,311 --> 00:34:03,801
Every nerve in your body is alive.

347
00:34:04,002 --> 00:34:07,864
Who else to live such a life?  Don't 
hide from it, Flynn. Celebrate it.

348
00:34:09,007 --> 00:34:10,310
Any suggestions?

349
00:34:10,529 --> 00:34:13,139
Well, you could start with a drink.

350
00:34:13,337 --> 00:34:15,610
They're still going to be 
out there.  With guns.

351
00:34:15,796 --> 00:34:18,039
Well then maybe we make it two.

352
00:34:20,610 --> 00:34:22,603
I love this city.

353
00:34:54,883 --> 00:34:58,332
I haven't had this much fun in a long time.

354
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,999
You asked for a vacation.
I bring you a vacation.

355
00:35:01,178 --> 00:35:02,942
Next time without the 
gunfire and the running.

356
00:35:03,149 --> 00:35:05,025
Oh, stop complaining.

357
00:35:07,935 --> 00:35:09,560
Can I, uh...may I

358
00:35:09,742 --> 00:35:11,668
ask you a personal question?

359
00:35:11,874 --> 00:35:14,602
Why ruin the night 
with personal questions?

360
00:35:14,812 --> 00:35:17,329
Because I want to know...No.

361
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:20,562
I need to know.

362
00:35:23,875 --> 00:35:25,667
Is there...
Are you with somebody?

363
00:35:27,651 --> 00:35:35,157
No.  There was somebody a long time 
ago.  But not for many years.

364
00:35:36,175 --> 00:35:37,959
Why?

365
00:35:55,799 --> 00:35:57,328
Well...um...hey.

366
00:35:58,129 --> 00:36:02,859
- I hate to say goodnight, but...
- Then why say goodnight?

367
00:36:46,043 --> 00:36:47,639
Any sign of them?

368
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,112
No.  The professor?

369
00:36:50,406 --> 00:36:52,973
He made good translation from wax.

370
00:36:53,178 --> 00:36:55,093
Went to bed hours ago.

371
00:36:55,303 --> 00:36:58,167
We'll deal with them when 
we cross paths again.

372
00:36:59,709 --> 00:37:02,772
Giorgi take over for George.

373
00:37:22,118 --> 00:37:23,875
Who's there?

374
00:37:35,852 --> 00:37:37,898
Simone?

375
00:37:57,580 --> 00:37:59,749
Chalice.

376
00:38:02,073 --> 00:38:04,180
What chalice?

377
00:38:12,682 --> 00:38:15,757
- Shave'll take that hangover off.
- Shows, huh?

378
00:38:15,983 --> 00:38:18,134
New Orleans badge of honor, son.

379
00:38:19,979 --> 00:38:25,190
<i>I got the blues...</i>
Looks like you got 'em worse, though

380
00:38:26,041 --> 00:38:28,113
That's a new one.

381
00:38:28,342 --> 00:38:31,381
Welcome.  Welcome.
Come, sit down.

382
00:38:35,117 --> 00:38:37,426
Enjoying New Orleans, Flynn?

383
00:38:40,674 --> 00:38:42,213
What you know about this?

384
00:38:42,479 --> 00:38:44,724
- I have no idea it's your vacation.
- HA!

385
00:38:46,775 --> 00:38:48,551
It's early 1800's

386
00:38:48,713 --> 00:38:52,839
Markings are a mixture of Latin 
Vulgate, early Romance with a 
spiffy transcription cipher

387
00:38:53,478 --> 00:38:55,498
What does it say?

388
00:38:55,714 --> 00:39:01,139
Even into her night, the Queen of the 
Loa guards the cup of the dagger man.

389
00:39:01,801 --> 00:39:04,474
- A riddle?
- Exactly.

390
00:39:07,386 --> 00:39:09,963
- I haven't cracked the first part, yet
- What about the second half?

391
00:39:12,314 --> 00:39:17,486
The man's dagger in Latin is "icarius" which 
is believed to be the etymology of "iscariot"

392
00:39:17,806 --> 00:39:19,746
as in Judas Iscariot.

393
00:39:20,212 --> 00:39:24,608
The cup of the dagger man is...
This is about the Judas Chalice.

394
00:39:25,336 --> 00:39:26,778
You know of it?

395
00:39:27,021 --> 00:39:31,521
The chalice made of the 30 pieces of silver 
given to Judas Iscariot to betray Christ.

396
00:39:31,897 --> 00:39:34,213
What about the rest of the legend?

397
00:39:34,508 --> 00:39:36,892
Power of the Chalice to resurrect

398
00:39:37,058 --> 00:39:39,833
- A vamp...
- Don't say it.  It's ridiculous.

399
00:39:40,124 --> 00:39:42,410
You've seen a lot of 
strange things, Flynn.

400
00:39:42,575 --> 00:39:44,605
Vampires, Judson?

401
00:39:45,028 --> 00:39:47,602
What would the chalice even 
have to do with vampires?

402
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:50,902
Judas Iscariot hanged himself 
from a tree after the betrayal.

403
00:39:51,082 --> 00:39:55,496
Cursed by God to wanter the 
land forever.  The first vampire.

404
00:39:57,977 --> 00:39:59,962
You buy that?

405
00:40:00,164 --> 00:40:03,488
Well, that would explain the 
vampire's aversion to silver

406
00:40:03,677 --> 00:40:08,632
Due to the original 30 coins.  Their 
hatred of the cross.  Holy water.

407
00:40:08,974 --> 00:40:10,553
And the wooden stake?

408
00:40:10,810 --> 00:40:14,854
Not just any wood, a stake of Aspen, 
the tree from which Judas hanged himself.

409
00:40:15,817 --> 00:40:18,635
It's the only way to kill a true vampire.

410
00:40:18,812 --> 00:40:21,518
So the power of the Chalice to 
resurrect dead vampires and to 

411
00:40:21,679 --> 00:40:25,818
bestow upon a living vampire ultimate
strength and speed - that's real?

412
00:40:26,047 --> 00:40:27,945
That's a very good question.

413
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,818
Another good question is

414
00:40:31,088 --> 00:40:34,696
why would someone dig up 
the grave of Vlad Dracul?

415
00:40:35,225 --> 00:40:36,668
Dracula?

416
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:41,167
Yes, they raided his tomb 
and his coffin was stolen.

417
00:40:41,358 --> 00:40:44,977
Okay, so somebody's looking for a 
chalice that resurrects dead vampires

418
00:40:45,148 --> 00:40:47,776
at the same time that Dracula's 
body's gone missing?

419
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:52,455
That's not good.

420
00:40:56,236 --> 00:40:58,100
Hey, Judson!

421
00:41:01,619 --> 00:41:05,331
The Chalice was hidden by 
French monks in the 15th century.

422
00:41:05,893 --> 00:41:09,250
Then later they moved it as far 
away from Romania as they could.

423
00:41:09,572 --> 00:41:12,699
Across the ocean?  Oh of course! 
'Cause New Orleans was a French territory.

424
00:41:12,873 --> 00:41:15,308
So the Chalice is...
The Chalice is here!

425
00:41:16,583 --> 00:41:21,425
All right.  I gotta ask you. 
Last night, I met a girl

426
00:41:22,168 --> 00:41:24,018
And somehow she knew that 
I was the Librarian

427
00:41:24,185 --> 00:41:27,126
and I just have to ask you 
straight out: did you send her?

428
00:41:30,565 --> 00:41:32,125
Judson!

429
00:41:55,069 --> 00:41:57,463
Well, we got to get in and 
out before sunset.

430
00:41:57,723 --> 00:41:59,352
They lock this thing 
up tight at night.

431
00:41:59,504 --> 00:42:02,698
You sure this is the right cemetary?
Lot of conflicting opinions. 
Maybe she was buried in--

432
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:08,050
Mr. professor museum man.
You want to see Marie Laveau's 
tomb, I take you.

433
00:42:11,793 --> 00:42:14,854
I just didn't think you was 
the mumbo-jumbo kind, though.

434
00:42:15,036 --> 00:42:16,346
You don't believe in Voodoo?

435
00:42:16,524 --> 00:42:18,969
Why?  I'm a black man 
living in New Orleans.

436
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:21,723
Why I got to believe in Vodoo?
I mean, this is the 21st century.

437
00:42:22,309 --> 00:42:23,321
Sorry.

438
00:42:24,248 --> 00:42:26,900
Why do you wanna see Marie 
Laveau's tomb, anyway, huh?

439
00:42:27,121 --> 00:42:30,027
Even into her night, the Queen of the 
Loa...Loa are, um, Voodoo spirits.

440
00:42:30,424 --> 00:42:33,092
Agassou, Limba, Simbi

441
00:42:33,284 --> 00:42:34,671
Oh yeah, that's a lotta loa, huh?

442
00:42:34,851 --> 00:42:37,085
Most influential Voodoo queen 
was Marie Laveau.  I um...

443
00:42:37,595 --> 00:42:41,279
I have a phD in comparitive 
religions.  Two, actually.

444
00:42:41,827 --> 00:42:43,245
Well, "into the night" could mean...

445
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:45,742
Into HER night.  It's 
a metaphor for death.

446
00:42:45,818 --> 00:42:51,838
See, I think that the monks 
who made this hid something 
in her tomb.  A clue.

447
00:42:52,636 --> 00:42:56,185
- To what?
- To the Judas Chalice.

448
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:00,807
Guards the cup of the dagger man.

449
00:43:02,286 --> 00:43:04,050
Dagger man.

450
00:43:08,109 --> 00:43:10,977
Hello Judas.  A slot.

451
00:43:11,538 --> 00:43:16,983
US mint was founded in 1792. 
Spanish coins, still in circulation 

452
00:43:17,322 --> 00:43:21,251
3/4 inch in diameter.  Current coin 
radius comparable size would be...

453
00:43:24,357 --> 00:43:27,212
- You don't have a silver dollar on you, do you?
- Let me see.

454
00:43:29,717 --> 00:43:32,872
- Aah.  My cousin collects them.
- Sure. 

455
00:43:35,035 --> 00:43:37,472
Here's you piece of silver, Judas.

456
00:43:41,322 --> 00:43:43,858
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm good.  I'm good.

457
00:43:50,123 --> 00:43:53,737
- What's it say?
- I don't know yet.

458
00:44:05,832 --> 00:44:07,710
Hey, Mr. professor man.

459
00:44:10,397 --> 00:44:12,379
Mr. professor man.

460
00:44:29,656 --> 00:44:31,250
No, you can't.

461
00:44:31,468 --> 00:44:35,430
...where old man said it...Oh, hello.

462
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:41,268
- The clue, and more.
- Good work.

463
00:44:44,015 --> 00:44:51,131
Flynn Carsen, according to badge you are 
Librarian of Metropolitan Library of New York.

464
00:44:51,890 --> 00:44:53,269
That's right.

465
00:44:53,441 --> 00:44:56,063
So you are down here collecting 
overdue books?

466
00:44:57,260 --> 00:45:00,516
Who do you really work for?
FBI, CIA?

467
00:45:00,703 --> 00:45:02,985
Why you want the Judas Chalice?

468
00:45:03,225 --> 00:45:07,718
I already have the Judas Plate.  And the Judas 
Knife and Fork.  So if I want the complete set...

469
00:45:10,161 --> 00:45:12,634
You don't know who I am?

470
00:45:12,866 --> 00:45:15,743
Sergei Kubichek, former KGB.

471
00:45:16,048 --> 00:45:19,025
Security Minister of the new Russian 
Government until six months ago

472
00:45:19,319 --> 00:45:23,551
when you resigned under the 
charges that you were...agressive.

473
00:45:24,593 --> 00:45:26,640
Democracy not working for you, Sergei?

474
00:45:26,810 --> 00:45:31,034
Chaos not working for me. Starvation.

475
00:45:31,637 --> 00:45:34,571
Well, one man can't fix it all.

476
00:45:34,754 --> 00:45:38,169
One man leading army of 
unkillable soldiers can.

477
00:45:40,688 --> 00:45:44,614
Who could stand against 
an army led by Dracul?

478
00:45:45,353 --> 00:45:50,281
- Manned by a hundred, a thousand undead.
- He's here.

479
00:45:50,977 --> 00:45:52,623
You raided the coffin?

480
00:45:52,832 --> 00:45:55,235
We are going to bring 
order back to Russia.

481
00:45:55,448 --> 00:45:59,957
We are going to rebuild Russia 
to her former glory and beyond.

482
00:46:01,494 --> 00:46:05,877
Wow.  I actually never sat this 
close to a psychopath before.

483
00:46:06,849 --> 00:46:08,515
Kill him.

484
00:46:10,330 --> 00:46:11,993
You can't kill me.

485
00:46:12,165 --> 00:46:15,038
That coin has writing on 
it over 500 years old.

486
00:46:15,431 --> 00:46:17,558
You meat heads won't 
be able to decipher it.

487
00:46:17,746 --> 00:46:20,032
I, on the other hand, 
have phD's in cryptology

488
00:46:20,227 --> 00:46:22,074
and every language 
you can imagine.

489
00:46:22,245 --> 00:46:24,809
Face it, Kubichek.
You need me.

490
00:46:26,965 --> 00:46:30,514
You don't put much faith 
in my organizational abilities

491
00:46:33,262 --> 00:46:34,706
Professor Amil Lazlo?

492
00:46:34,995 --> 00:46:38,198
- You've heard of him?
- Of course.  You're a genius.

493
00:46:38,496 --> 00:46:39,571
Thank you.

494
00:46:39,745 --> 00:46:42,138
I have read every book you've written 
on Eastern European folklore.

495
00:46:42,288 --> 00:46:43,921
I especially the synth...

496
00:46:44,060 --> 00:46:47,285
So...if I have Professor Lazlo?

497
00:46:48,484 --> 00:46:51,557
Uh, yes.  In that case, killing 
me is totally an option.

498
00:46:52,645 --> 00:46:55,088
I'm sorry, son, I had no 
choice.  They forced me.

499
00:46:59,767 --> 00:47:01,347
Make it interesting.  Have your...

500
00:47:05,376 --> 00:47:07,301
Didn't we bring more men?

501
00:47:07,509 --> 00:47:12,832
George disappeared, then Peter, then 
two others.  Drinking, maybe?

502
00:47:13,128 --> 00:47:15,896
So hard to find good help.

503
00:47:21,433 --> 00:47:26,213
Look, I get this 
from Voodoo shop.

504
00:47:27,269 --> 00:47:32,750
Datura, made from a poisonous weed known 
to cause disorientation and hallucination.

505
00:47:33,175 --> 00:47:34,654
Used in Voodoo ceremonies.

506
00:47:34,857 --> 00:47:38,462
You always talk in, like, whole 
paragraphs. You ever notice that?

507
00:47:39,088 --> 00:47:41,129
Open up.

508
00:47:48,170 --> 00:47:49,462
Get the car.

509
00:47:49,639 --> 00:47:53,213
Drug kicks in, we'll drive him into the 
river.  Make it look like an accident.

510
00:47:55,075 --> 00:48:00,474
Okay, Mr. Librarian.  What kind of fancy 
books will get you out of this one?

511
00:48:05,153 --> 00:48:07,457
Houdini and wrote books, too.

512
00:48:20,790 --> 00:48:21,417
You?

513
00:48:21,712 --> 00:48:24,753
Flynn Carsen.  I got about two minutes 
before I'm in a full blown hallucination.

514
00:48:24,919 --> 00:48:26,146
So we gotta get you outta here.

515
00:48:26,352 --> 00:48:28,978
- I just deciphered the markings...
- There's no time for tha--

516
00:48:29,577 --> 00:48:31,565
- You did?
- Yes.

517
00:48:31,764 --> 00:48:35,009
What language is it this 
time? Is it French?

518
00:48:35,044 --> 00:48:38,254
Langue d'oc.  It makes reference 
to the Vigenère cipher.  Here.

519
00:48:40,306 --> 00:48:42,584
- Find the numerical transposition...
- Yes.

520
00:48:43,362 --> 00:48:49,656
- M-E-A-L-I...
- How many combinations?

521
00:48:49,993 --> 00:48:52,553
- Ten charactors...
- Factor of 10.

522
00:48:52,712 --> 00:48:54,747
Divided by four which is 
the repeated characters

523
00:48:54,957 --> 00:48:56,826
907,200

524
00:48:57,574 --> 00:49:01,182
It's Latin.  Illuminate.
[mumbles]

525
00:49:10,152 --> 00:49:13,220
- What?  Illuminate what?
- Wait a minute.

526
00:49:14,470 --> 00:49:18,721
The tarnish on this coin.  Silver 
oxidizes, it doesn't corrode like this.

527
00:49:20,023 --> 00:49:24,001
I was so preoccupied with the writing, 
I never examined the coin itself.

528
00:49:26,877 --> 00:49:28,894
- It's glass.
- Glass.

529
00:49:29,551 --> 00:49:34,109
This isn't a coin.
This is a lens.

530
00:49:43,161 --> 00:49:44,866
Morgus Bay.

531
00:49:45,077 --> 00:49:46,539
That's where we need to go.

532
00:49:46,741 --> 00:49:50,096
God, you make one 
hell of a historian!

533
00:49:52,141 --> 00:49:54,735
Flynn? Flynn?

534
00:49:56,414 --> 00:49:58,858
I'm out of time.  We 
gotta get you going.

535
00:49:59,048 --> 00:50:00,546
Come on. Come on.

536
00:50:00,755 --> 00:50:02,230
No, no.

537
00:50:04,111 --> 00:50:06,788
My legs are too slow.
You go.  I will...

538
00:50:10,242 --> 00:50:12,441
- I'm good.
- Good luck.

539
00:50:39,509 --> 00:50:44,375
- Please help me. People are chasing me.
- Need a chaser, Bro?  PARTY!  YEAH!

540
00:51:06,847 --> 00:51:09,417
- Okay, going away.
- Get up Flynn.

541
00:51:10,348 --> 00:51:14,333
You're not going to think yourself 
out of this one, book boy.

542
00:51:29,818 --> 00:51:31,342
Where did she come from?

543
00:51:31,543 --> 00:51:35,430
- Simone?
- I leave you alone for one day...

544
00:51:35,924 --> 00:51:39,259
Now please, GO, before 
there is trouble.

545
00:51:43,091 --> 00:51:47,285
- Nicolai, shoot this tramp.
- With pleasure.

546
00:51:53,250 --> 00:51:54,786
Shoot her!

547
00:52:09,839 --> 00:52:13,143
- Flynn!
- Simone!

548
00:52:23,992 --> 00:52:26,608
- Missed.
- Didn't.

549
00:52:45,723 --> 00:52:47,237
Simone?

550
00:52:49,723 --> 00:52:52,970
Don't die.
Don't die because of me.

551
00:53:20,820 --> 00:53:24,443
- Hello?
- Hi.

552
00:53:45,425 --> 00:53:47,153
Oh good, you're awake.

553
00:53:47,390 --> 00:53:48,970
I made you some tea.

554
00:53:50,948 --> 00:53:52,702
But I saw you get shot.

555
00:53:53,290 --> 00:53:55,587
You had no pulse, 
you were dead.

556
00:53:55,772 --> 00:53:57,863
Yeah, sure, I was already dead.

557
00:53:58,855 --> 00:54:01,851
What do you mean dead?
Like undead? Like a vampire?

558
00:54:02,028 --> 00:54:07,112
Afraid so.  Tea?
Oh! That is very hurtful!

559
00:54:07,527 --> 00:54:10,321
Well, excuse me! I just woke 
up in a vampire's lair!

560
00:54:12,427 --> 00:54:14,545
You didn't...you didn't...

561
00:54:14,932 --> 00:54:17,202
I don't kill for food.

562
00:54:18,558 --> 00:54:21,306
See?
Blood.

563
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:25,588
- Oh God.
- Check for holes.

564
00:54:34,802 --> 00:54:37,348
Kidding.  You're so uptight.

565
00:54:42,191 --> 00:54:44,633
That's early Baroque, 
about 300 years old.

566
00:54:46,436 --> 00:54:48,496
In fact, a lot of this stuff is.

567
00:54:48,714 --> 00:54:52,528
Yes, momentoes I have 
collected over the years.

568
00:54:54,674 --> 00:54:57,077
And...how old are you?

569
00:54:57,257 --> 00:55:00,895
Americans...to ask a 
lady such a question.

570
00:55:02,328 --> 00:55:04,521
I'm 403 years old.

571
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:08,093
- 400?
- Oui.

572
00:55:08,374 --> 00:55:10,307
- And three?
- Yes.

573
00:55:10,930 --> 00:55:13,496
Well, I've dated older 
women before, but

574
00:55:14,286 --> 00:55:17,717
dead is new for me.

575
00:55:18,158 --> 00:55:21,750
Yeah, so I thought I knew a lot about 
history because I've studied it, but you

576
00:55:22,749 --> 00:55:26,125
you have actually lived it.

577
00:55:26,306 --> 00:55:31,494
- How did you ...
- I was born in Paris in 1603.

578
00:55:32,286 --> 00:55:38,678
It was a very exciting century, there 
was Galileo, Shakespeare, Rembrant,

579
00:55:38,883 --> 00:55:41,531
a thrilling time to be alive.

580
00:55:41,775 --> 00:55:46,430
And in Paris, I met Francoise.
He was a teacher at the university.

581
00:55:47,913 --> 00:55:51,632
We love and we 
were soon engaged.

582
00:55:52,090 --> 00:55:55,257
I always loved music ever 
since I was a little girl.

583
00:55:55,436 --> 00:55:59,237
And by the age of 25 I was an 
opera singer at the Royal Court.

584
00:56:10,407 --> 00:56:13,198
It was the best time 
of my life until...

585
00:56:19,668 --> 00:56:23,524
I died on June 12, 1628.

586
00:56:24,012 --> 00:56:29,157
A vampire passed his curse onto 
me, condemning my soul to 
walk the night forever.

587
00:56:30,044 --> 00:56:31,869
Never to rest.

588
00:56:32,928 --> 00:56:35,787
And Francoise?

589
00:56:36,683 --> 00:56:39,119
I never saw him again.

590
00:56:39,999 --> 00:56:43,299
My destiny took my 
love away from me.

591
00:56:44,633 --> 00:56:47,873
He did love books very much.

592
00:56:49,352 --> 00:56:52,544
I stayed on in Paris 
for another 200 years

593
00:56:52,735 --> 00:56:56,018
trying to find the 
vampire and kill him.

594
00:56:56,202 --> 00:57:02,068
But he vanished.  I learned 
about the Judas Chalice and how 
it could resurrect dead vamipires.

595
00:57:02,475 --> 00:57:05,985
With such a power, I knew the 
undead could overrun the Earth.

596
00:57:06,182 --> 00:57:07,576
You wanted to protect it.

597
00:57:07,825 --> 00:57:10,474
That's why I followed the 
trail to the monastery.

598
00:57:12,925 --> 00:57:15,535
But I couldn't decipher
the writing on the pendant.

599
00:57:15,758 --> 00:57:19,912
So I decided to stay on in New 
Orleans to protect at least 
this part of the puzzle.

600
00:57:20,391 --> 00:57:24,761
Until I saw some man studying 
the monastery and I knew that 
trouble was coming.

601
00:57:28,124 --> 00:57:31,139
That's why you appeared in my dream.

602
00:57:31,549 --> 00:57:35,019
- You were asking for help.
- From the Librarian.

603
00:57:36,114 --> 00:57:38,056
How do you know about the library?
See, that's just...

604
00:57:38,250 --> 00:57:40,222
Oh, all vampires know about the library.

605
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:43,839
You Librarians have been around 
almost as long as we have.

606
00:57:44,176 --> 00:57:46,956
This is from before Crusades.

607
00:57:47,681 --> 00:57:52,184
It depicts the library's 
eternal battle against evil.

608
00:57:52,477 --> 00:57:55,811
More to your job than just 
saving old relics, huh Flynn?

609
00:57:57,259 --> 00:58:00,645
The symbol on the shield, 
that's the Tree of Knowledge.

610
00:58:02,615 --> 00:58:04,116
Who's the knight?

611
00:58:04,298 --> 00:58:07,475
He is known as the Scholar.
He is the greatest Librarian of them all.

612
00:58:08,036 --> 00:58:11,740
Legend has it, he built the library 
and is keeper of all of its secrets.

613
00:58:13,464 --> 00:58:16,461
He is known as Iahuda.

614
00:58:18,083 --> 00:58:25,187
That's Hebrew.  It's the Hebrew name for... 
The Hebrew name for Judson.

615
00:58:29,663 --> 00:58:33,722
The sunrise is in one hour.
I can't go out during the day.

616
00:58:33,911 --> 00:58:36,635
Simone, I need you to come with 
me.  I know where the Chalice is.

617
00:58:36,834 --> 00:58:38,591
Morgus Bay, about a half 
a day's drive from here.

618
00:58:38,779 --> 00:58:41,311
It's too far, I will never 
survive the trip in the sunlight.

619
00:58:44,060 --> 00:58:46,372
I know somebody.

620
00:58:48,540 --> 00:58:51,335
Hey, hey, Mr. professor man.
This is my cousin Earl.

621
00:58:53,661 --> 00:58:55,703
You disappeared on me 
after the big show.

622
00:58:55,894 --> 00:58:58,839
Sorry, Andre, I met some 
friends. This is the luckiest 
boat in New Orleans, huh?

623
00:58:58,997 --> 00:59:00,379
Well, I never said it was the prettiest.

624
00:59:00,549 --> 00:59:02,270
Simone, Andre.
Andre, Simone.
Cousin Earl.

625
00:59:08,607 --> 00:59:10,971
If that's the freinds 
you met, I forgive you.

626
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:14,035
You're starting to get that 
New Orleans spirit, mon ami.

627
00:59:14,831 --> 00:59:16,456
How far to Morgus Bay?

628
00:59:16,692 --> 00:59:20,008
We should get there around 
nightfall.  But why Morgus? I 
mean, it ain't nothing but swamp...

629
00:59:20,170 --> 00:59:22,218
I'm going in the 
cabin now, Andre.

630
00:59:22,517 --> 00:59:24,995
We don't want to be 
disturbed until nightfall.

631
00:59:25,975 --> 00:59:27,795
Okay.  I get it.

632
00:59:28,073 --> 00:59:31,979
- Okay?
- I get it.

633
00:59:33,146 --> 00:59:35,864
Laissez les bon temps roulez, baby.

634
00:59:37,086 --> 00:59:39,191
Gas me up, Cous'.

635
01:00:01,159 --> 01:00:03,612
Now Morgus is a mile inside the swamp.

636
01:00:03,671 --> 01:00:07,519
Now the water is too shallow, you 
gonna have to paddle the rest from here.

637
01:00:08,734 --> 01:00:10,278
You sure about this?

638
01:00:10,473 --> 01:00:12,721
Leave the light on for us.

639
01:00:46,014 --> 01:00:47,411
Are you okay?

640
01:00:47,630 --> 01:00:50,338
- I'm fine.  Are you okay?
- Yes.  I'm fine.

641
01:00:50,462 --> 01:00:52,256
Okay.

642
01:00:53,455 --> 01:00:56,117
It's a warning.

643
01:00:57,087 --> 01:00:59,774
Somebody doesn't want 
us to go any farther.

644
01:01:04,050 --> 01:01:07,301
Oh...is that what I think it is?

645
01:01:09,033 --> 01:01:10,831
Cover your eyes.

646
01:01:24,323 --> 01:01:27,189
It's the Pride.  That's Lafitte's ship.

647
01:01:28,198 --> 01:01:30,726
See, Jean Lafitte was a 
19th century pirate, he was...
<i>Flynn...</i>

648
01:01:30,987 --> 01:01:34,219
We must be near the Barataria 
swamp.  But he used to use this

649
01:01:34,303 --> 01:01:40,026
maze of swamps as his headquarters
Flynn, I know, I was here twice when 
it was docked in New Orleans. Parties.

650
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:42,856
- So you knew the pirate Lafitte?
- Mmm-hmm.

651
01:01:43,208 --> 01:01:45,207
Lightweight when it came to rum.

652
01:01:45,392 --> 01:01:47,867
Not so tough, passed 
out in his puffy shirt.

653
01:01:50,472 --> 01:01:52,512
Well, I guess you knew him well.

654
01:01:55,644 --> 01:02:02,513
- If I remember correctly, these stairs lead to...
- Look out!

655
01:02:05,501 --> 01:02:07,116
Trip wire.

656
01:02:08,673 --> 01:02:10,142
Would you have survived that?

657
01:02:10,392 --> 01:02:13,353
Head cut off?  As bad 
as sunlight.  I go POOF.

658
01:02:14,387 --> 01:02:15,629
Stake through the heart?

659
01:02:15,863 --> 01:02:18,165
Only wood from an 
Aspen tree will work.

660
01:02:19,279 --> 01:02:21,775
- Hey!
- Just asking.

661
01:02:24,839 --> 01:02:28,166
- This way?
- That leads to Jean's quarters.

662
01:02:29,503 --> 01:02:33,289
- You mean his bedroom, don't you?
- Now, now.  Don't be jealous.

663
01:02:52,590 --> 01:02:54,353
Well, well, well.

664
01:02:58,624 --> 01:03:03,081
The man himself,
buried with his treasure.

665
01:03:03,990 --> 01:03:06,504
I guess you can take it with you.

666
01:03:10,812 --> 01:03:13,401
That's just...nasty.

667
01:03:14,780 --> 01:03:16,377
Combination lock.

668
01:03:16,571 --> 01:03:19,294
It'll be opened with 
the right six letters.

669
01:03:19,491 --> 01:03:21,702
- Clue is in...
- French?

670
01:03:24,989 --> 01:03:30,027
The faith was breached, 
the mark was sealed.

671
01:03:30,796 --> 01:03:36,343
- Faith was breached?
- The mark was sealed.
- Um, violation, deception, betrayal

672
01:03:36,742 --> 01:03:39,103
A betrayal, sealed with a kiss.

673
01:03:39,932 --> 01:03:44,763
You see, Judas signaled the Romans 
and sealed Christ's fate with a kiss.

674
01:03:45,116 --> 01:03:47,461
- And in French, kiss is...
- Un baiser.

675
01:03:54,630 --> 01:03:56,104
- Ready?
- Yes.

676
01:03:57,718 --> 01:03:59,444
A little help.

677
01:04:17,479 --> 01:04:19,481
The Judas Chalice.

678
01:04:20,345 --> 01:04:22,428
Holy Grail for vampires.

679
01:04:23,384 --> 01:04:25,229
I thought it would be bigger.

680
01:04:25,687 --> 01:04:28,890
Anticlimactic after all this treasure.

681
01:04:35,194 --> 01:04:38,030
Wow.  This stuff is like 
catnip for you guys, huh?

682
01:04:38,515 --> 01:04:40,987
You know, I think that 
we should go now.

683
01:04:42,732 --> 01:04:44,440
Kind of a shame, really.

684
01:04:44,739 --> 01:04:46,900
Can't take the whole 
thing back with us.

685
01:04:47,196 --> 01:04:50,432
This would make a wonderful addition 
to the Large Collection Annex.

686
01:04:50,893 --> 01:04:53,134
They could put it right 
next to Noah's Ark...

687
01:04:53,370 --> 01:04:58,499
15 men on a dead man's chest.
Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum.

688
01:04:59,608 --> 01:05:02,198
I really must thank you for 
finding the Chalice for me.

689
01:05:02,385 --> 01:05:04,441
Old man said you did all the work.

690
01:05:06,076 --> 01:05:07,710
Professor?

691
01:05:08,339 --> 01:05:11,895
I have looked for this my 
whole life, son.  I had to see it.

692
01:05:15,987 --> 01:05:17,667
You.

693
01:05:24,470 --> 01:05:30,042
Old man warned me about you.
I thought it was all nonsense 
but better safe than sorry.

694
01:05:30,250 --> 01:05:32,405
Kubichek, if you hurt her I swear I'm...

695
01:05:32,868 --> 01:05:34,935
You'll what?

696
01:05:35,489 --> 01:05:38,429
Take away my
library card?

697
01:05:42,215 --> 01:05:45,638
I'd originally planned to 
resurrect Vlad on Russian soil

698
01:05:46,644 --> 01:05:51,646
But tomorrow we begin with America.
Build up nice little army...

699
01:05:51,816 --> 01:05:54,926
You don't know what you're doing.
You're unleashing a monster!

700
01:05:55,450 --> 01:05:59,603
You would know what sort of monster. 
How long since you last fed?

701
01:06:02,916 --> 01:06:04,506
Lock them in.

702
01:06:04,725 --> 01:06:07,598
Let them rot together for eternity!

703
01:06:08,247 --> 01:06:10,958
Or until hunger gets better of her.

704
01:06:27,540 --> 01:06:29,190
Flynn, are you okay?

705
01:06:29,375 --> 01:06:35,734
My eye really hurts.  This door's made out of
iron, these walls are 6 inces of wood, and 
it's about 20 hours 'til they resurrect Vlad.

706
01:06:36,425 --> 01:06:38,837
Okay, Simone, do your thing.

707
01:06:42,329 --> 01:06:43,903
I could do that.

708
01:06:44,108 --> 01:06:48,222
I'm sorry Flynn, I'm too weak,
I haven't fed in over 24 hours.

709
01:06:49,842 --> 01:06:54,137
Okay, well don't get any ideas.  You 
just sit right over here and relax.

710
01:07:01,684 --> 01:07:03,365
I can't believe this.

711
01:07:03,710 --> 01:07:09,258
After centuries trying to protect the 
Chalice, I failed.  And I led them here.

712
01:07:09,452 --> 01:07:11,364
Well, technically, I led them here.

713
01:07:11,569 --> 01:07:16,000
But it's not over yet.  For a 403 year old 
woman, you sure don't have a lot of patience.

714
01:07:21,213 --> 01:07:23,236
This looks promising.

715
01:07:25,941 --> 01:07:28,949
Newton's third law.
I've got an idea.

716
01:07:41,299 --> 01:07:46,158
Potassium nitrate.  Perfect.

717
01:08:00,886 --> 01:08:03,326
- Flynn, there are no cannon balls.
- We don't need them.

718
01:08:04,366 --> 01:08:05,199
Newton's third law?

719
01:08:05,519 --> 01:08:08,366
Every action has an equal 
and opposite reaction.

720
01:08:09,076 --> 01:08:11,742
The explosion should be strong 
enough to drive this cannon back

721
01:08:11,938 --> 01:08:15,092
- and through that door.
- Should?

722
01:08:15,293 --> 01:08:18,667
Well...like about 60% of 
the plans I come up with 

723
01:08:19,058 --> 01:08:22,787
there is a strong possibility that it 
could all go horribly, horribly wrong.

724
01:08:23,780 --> 01:08:26,716
We could die in the explosion.

725
01:08:29,622 --> 01:08:32,938
- Well I can't die.
- Right, so I'm the only one who 
could die in the explosion.

726
01:08:35,690 --> 01:08:37,981
Glad we clarified that.

727
01:08:38,969 --> 01:08:41,276
- Okay.  Here we go.
- Wait.

728
01:08:42,584 --> 01:08:44,106
For luck.

729
01:08:46,571 --> 01:08:48,074
Here goes nothing.

730
01:08:49,747 --> 01:08:51,213
Wait, wait, wait...

731
01:08:59,379 --> 01:09:01,778
Yay Newton!

732
01:09:06,811 --> 01:09:08,366
Andre!

733
01:09:14,868 --> 01:09:16,446
Andre!

734
01:09:19,229 --> 01:09:21,680
He's been hit from behind.  See 
if you can go start the boat.

735
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:24,419
Andre?

736
01:09:32,008 --> 01:09:34,727
Simone!  No, no, no!
Stop the boat!

737
01:09:34,944 --> 01:09:37,502
I'm sorry, Flynn, but 
you can't come with me.

738
01:09:38,502 --> 01:09:40,206
Simone, what are you doing?

739
01:09:41,267 --> 01:09:42,975
Simone!

740
01:09:44,188 --> 01:09:47,599
Your girl done stole 
my cousin's boat.

741
01:09:48,171 --> 01:09:51,290
- Thought you said this boat was lucky?
- It is.  For her.

742
01:10:31,617 --> 01:10:34,090
- This is my cousin Horace.
- I'm not complaining.

743
01:10:47,716 --> 01:10:50,295
Just talked to Earl, the boat's 
back at the dock, safe and sound.

744
01:10:50,851 --> 01:10:53,932
Well, looks like you got an 
honest girl, there.  For a thief.

745
01:10:54,553 --> 01:10:56,807
- Thanks.
- You need anything else?

746
01:10:58,340 --> 01:11:02,524
Don't suppose you can help me 
find a plantation house being 
rented by a bunch of Russians?

747
01:11:02,777 --> 01:11:05,958
Well, there are a lot of plantation 
houses in New Orleans.  Uh, can't 
you tell me anything else?

748
01:11:06,316 --> 01:11:09,881
No.  I don't really remember 
much from my visit there.

749
01:11:10,188 --> 01:11:13,342
What, you been there already?
Well, what you need me for?

750
01:11:13,801 --> 01:11:17,242
Look, I know you got the photographic 
memory in that head of yours.

751
01:11:17,619 --> 01:11:19,312
I got faith in you.

752
01:11:21,155 --> 01:11:26,569
- Thanks, Andre.
- Bonne chance, Mr. professor man. C'mon, Cous'

753
01:12:43,615 --> 01:12:44,964
Surprise!

754
01:12:48,505 --> 01:12:49,853
That went better in my head.

755
01:12:50,077 --> 01:12:52,225
What are you doing here?
You shouldn't be here.

756
01:12:52,432 --> 01:12:54,846
Why?  So I won't see 
you steal the Chalice?

757
01:12:55,172 --> 01:12:57,491
- To become all powerful?
- You don't understand.

758
01:12:57,699 --> 01:12:59,932
I understand.  You betrayed me.

759
01:13:00,544 --> 01:13:03,353
- You want the Chalice for yourself.
And I thought you cared about...
- I do care.

760
01:13:05,145 --> 01:13:08,256
Get back!  I'll use 
this if I have to.

761
01:13:10,584 --> 01:13:15,403
Flynn, I left you at the dock 
because I was trying to protect you.

762
01:13:15,966 --> 01:13:21,922
Well, we got you got here again.  Honestly, 
we're not this good.  You two kind of 
suck at sneaking around.  Bring them.

763
01:13:31,986 --> 01:13:33,599
Just in time.

764
01:13:33,837 --> 01:13:37,757
I am sure Vlad Dracul will 
be starved when he's awake.

765
01:13:37,965 --> 01:13:39,414
You're making a big mistake, Kubichek.

766
01:13:39,650 --> 01:13:42,501
Let's see.  Open coffin.

767
01:13:50,985 --> 01:13:53,052
What's next, old man?

768
01:13:53,279 --> 01:13:55,819
Blood must be spilled into 
the Chalice, and then

769
01:13:56,051 --> 01:13:59,798
poured on the corpse at 
the stroke of midnight.

770
01:13:59,984 --> 01:14:04,046
Let's give Dracul a 
taste of his dinner.

771
01:14:21,388 --> 01:14:25,342
It's working.
IT'S WORKING!

772
01:14:38,724 --> 01:14:44,106
Rise from the dead, warrior prince!
Rise and do my bidding!

773
01:14:53,811 --> 01:14:55,750
This can't be!

774
01:15:01,124 --> 01:15:03,952
You crippled fool!

775
01:15:04,515 --> 01:15:08,586
It was all a hoax!
I kill you!

776
01:15:22,003 --> 01:15:23,596
Lazlo?

777
01:15:25,778 --> 01:15:28,536
- Lazlo is a vampire?
- I recognized him at the ship.

778
01:15:28,814 --> 01:15:31,142
He was the one I was 
trying to protect you from.

779
01:15:33,459 --> 01:15:35,829
The one who made me.

780
01:15:50,032 --> 01:15:52,132
We've got to get that 
Chalice away from him.

781
01:15:58,149 --> 01:16:00,725
You look for you missing men, Ivan?

782
01:16:01,093 --> 01:16:03,413
Sorry, I had to snack 
on the journey.

783
01:16:03,641 --> 01:16:06,031
You killed my men, Lazlo!

784
01:16:06,381 --> 01:16:08,567
Please call me Vlad.

785
01:16:08,906 --> 01:16:10,103
If you're Vlad, who's that?

786
01:16:10,405 --> 01:16:12,708
It's a peasant in a box.

787
01:16:12,943 --> 01:16:19,422
I have lived for centuries among you humans 
unnoticed until dead cattle got sick.  Cholera.

788
01:16:19,676 --> 01:16:21,120
1829 pandemic?

789
01:16:21,269 --> 01:16:22,656
- Flynn?
- I'm sorry.

790
01:16:23,010 --> 01:16:28,793
I drank infected blood, and I was trapped 
in this withering body.  Until now.

791
01:16:28,999 --> 01:16:32,722
You wanted the Chalice for a 
cure.  To revive your powers.

792
01:16:32,993 --> 01:16:35,576
Lucky for me, Kubichek
found the first clue.

793
01:16:35,746 --> 01:16:39,133
- Not so lucky for Kubichek.
- Well, I wouldn't say that.

794
01:16:40,322 --> 01:16:45,248
Now that I have the Chalice, 
I will summon my children

795
01:16:45,553 --> 01:16:49,399
and they will drink and we will 
plunge your world into darkness.

796
01:16:49,872 --> 01:16:53,677
Come child.  Join us. 
Drink and be strong.

797
01:16:55,864 --> 01:16:57,682
Simone?

798
01:17:11,762 --> 01:17:13,135
Never!

799
01:17:13,339 --> 01:17:15,996
You destroyed my life!

800
01:17:16,169 --> 01:17:18,089
Then die with others.

801
01:17:19,668 --> 01:17:21,179
Feed!

802
01:17:23,273 --> 01:17:25,829
You got a plan, book boy?
I'd love to hear it.

803
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,936
I'll take that.
Cover your eyes.

804
01:17:47,737 --> 01:17:49,712
Go get the Chalice!

805
01:17:57,056 --> 01:17:59,645
I know you're out here, Vlad!

806
01:18:02,474 --> 01:18:04,314
It's no use!

807
01:18:06,697 --> 01:18:08,478
Show yourself!

808
01:18:17,026 --> 01:18:20,639
I think it's only fair to warn you 
that I am, in fact, a Librarian.

809
01:18:22,299 --> 01:18:24,765
I've fought evil in many forms.

810
01:18:26,490 --> 01:18:30,445
Approximately 35 forms.
Give or take.

811
01:18:31,626 --> 01:18:34,561
So you have every 
reason to be afraid.

812
01:18:37,479 --> 01:18:39,710
Is that supposed to frighten me?

813
01:18:41,953 --> 01:18:44,684
'Cause mission accomplished.
Good job.

814
01:18:49,426 --> 01:18:53,272
Go! Help the Librarian!
Leave him to me!

815
01:19:13,423 --> 01:19:16,337
You follow a vampire into 
the woods at night?

816
01:19:17,268 --> 01:19:19,640
I thought you were a smart boy.

817
01:19:20,143 --> 01:19:22,650
I'm officially in trouble now.

818
01:19:28,280 --> 01:19:32,184
You Librarians break so 
easily. But tasty.

819
01:19:32,336 --> 01:19:36,042
You took my life away from me, 
but you don't get to take his.

820
01:19:36,250 --> 01:19:37,918
I gave you a gift!

821
01:19:38,083 --> 01:19:40,799
Allow me to repay favor!

822
01:20:01,781 --> 01:20:06,604
Join us Ivan, we can still 
restore order to Russia.

823
01:20:08,245 --> 01:20:12,900
I think it's time we try to pay the 
bill for what we've already done.

824
01:20:13,963 --> 01:20:17,653
- For Russia, old friend!
- Noooooooo!

825
01:20:33,473 --> 01:20:38,499
Populus tremuloides.
Populus tremuloides!

826
01:20:59,209 --> 01:21:02,399
I'm sorry for your pain, my child.

827
01:21:02,691 --> 01:21:07,140
But, as they say, the more tortured 
the vine, the sweeter the fruit.

828
01:21:07,328 --> 01:21:09,716
Vlad Dracul!

829
01:21:21,453 --> 01:21:23,908
Because I control
the Judas Chalice.

830
01:21:24,389 --> 01:21:26,468
So I control you.

831
01:21:26,734 --> 01:21:30,518
You stupid boy, that's 
not how it works.

832
01:21:32,675 --> 01:21:35,061
- Wrong move.
- Wrong hand.

833
01:21:37,093 --> 01:21:39,931
Populus tremuloides.  The aspen tree.

834
01:21:40,177 --> 01:21:43,543
Tree original tree that killed the 
original vampire, Judas Iscariot.

835
01:21:43,758 --> 01:21:48,940
Son, you make one hell of a historian.

836
01:22:16,506 --> 01:22:19,160
Simone, I want you to come 
back to New York with me.

837
01:22:19,650 --> 01:22:25,663
I mean, you already know everything about the 
Library, so I could show it to you.  I've never 
been able to share it with anybody before.

838
01:22:26,167 --> 01:22:29,302
I'm sorry, Flynn, I can't.
It's time for me to go.

839
01:22:29,724 --> 01:22:32,502
- What? Back to France?
- You did it, Flynn.

840
01:22:32,738 --> 01:22:35,067
You killed the vampire who made me.

841
01:22:35,252 --> 01:22:37,964
My soul can be at rest 
now, I can be at peace.

842
01:22:38,174 --> 01:22:41,133
Rest?  What, you mean die?
No, no, no, no, no.

843
01:22:42,230 --> 01:22:44,798
I already thought I lost you once, 
I'm not gonna go through that again.

844
01:22:44,980 --> 01:22:46,702
It's all right, Flynn.

845
01:22:48,633 --> 01:22:50,456
I want this.

846
01:22:50,935 --> 01:22:53,873
I've lived long enough, 
I made every day count.

847
01:22:54,102 --> 01:22:57,567
But we could be together.
There is a way.

848
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:20,364
You have to stay, 
and be the Librarian.

849
01:23:20,988 --> 01:23:24,669
You have to fulfill your destiny 
as I have fulfilled mine.

850
01:23:25,269 --> 01:23:28,924
Please Flynn, sometimes 
saying goodbye is...

851
01:23:30,963 --> 01:23:33,219
The right thing to do.

852
01:23:36,223 --> 01:23:39,076
You know, there is one thing 
you can do for me, though.

853
01:23:40,619 --> 01:23:43,538
I've always wanted to 
see the sun rise again.

854
01:23:45,154 --> 01:23:47,112
Will you watch it with me?

855
01:24:10,113 --> 01:24:12,054
It's beautiful.

856
01:24:25,229 --> 01:24:31,247
I loved you, Flynn.
For a little while.

857
01:24:35,473 --> 01:24:37,256
I loved you.

858
01:24:43,178 --> 01:24:48,253
- Goodbye Simone.
- Goodbye Flynn.

859
01:26:10,643 --> 01:26:12,269
I have something for you.

860
01:26:12,491 --> 01:26:15,843
- We did not authorize any...
- It's a thank you gift.

861
01:26:23,209 --> 01:26:24,579
It's beautiful.

862
01:26:24,797 --> 01:26:27,897
Early 1800's.  Made 
by French Monks.

863
01:26:28,920 --> 01:26:31,009
There's writing on it. 
What does it say?

864
01:26:31,199 --> 01:26:32,554
Latin.  Says: Even into her night..

865
01:26:35,284 --> 01:26:38,698
Says: Follow your dream.

866
01:26:41,082 --> 01:26:43,886
And where did you dream lead you?

867
01:26:45,080 --> 01:26:47,176
Home.

868
01:26:52,585 --> 01:26:56,301
- We're still not paying for any 
unauthorized funds for any...
- I know.

869
01:27:13,160 --> 01:27:16,098
Oh, that's mine.

870
01:27:18,743 --> 01:27:22,351
Well, Flynn, you've come 
through for us once again.

871
01:27:23,333 --> 01:27:26,201
I'm just sorry we 
ruined your vacation.

872
01:27:26,411 --> 01:27:29,294
- I wouldn't say "ruined".
- Oh.  Oh good.

873
01:27:30,111 --> 01:27:36,396
So have you decided on, you know, 
whether you're going to stay on 
as the Librarian or not?

874
01:27:36,863 --> 01:27:40,007
Someone very special told me 
I should embrace who I am.

875
01:27:40,752 --> 01:27:42,526
I think she was right.

876
01:27:42,731 --> 01:27:47,608
Then we won't... [clears throat]
we won't have anymore of those...

877
01:27:47,839 --> 01:27:50,393
- Meltdowns?  No.
- Good. 'Cause

878
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:55,224
Charlene was thinking 
about changing the locks.

879
01:28:01,026 --> 01:28:02,946
I know who you are.

880
01:28:04,458 --> 01:28:05,533
What?

881
01:28:09,594 --> 01:28:12,502
Come on Judson, I know that 
you're over 2000 years old.

882
01:28:12,977 --> 01:28:17,570
And know that the library is pitched in 
a larger battle between good and evil.

883
01:28:23,577 --> 01:28:25,454
- Iahuda.
- Yahoo to you, too.

884
01:28:25,908 --> 01:28:29,360
Flynn, I won't disagree that there 
is a battle between good and evil 

885
01:28:29,693 --> 01:28:34,125
and right now it seems like 
evil is winning. But soon,

886
01:28:34,297 --> 01:28:40,669
you and the library are going to play an 
even more important role in that struggle.

887
01:28:41,123 --> 01:28:51,921
And, as far as my being 2000 years old, 
that's...well, that's just insulting.

888
01:28:57,920 --> 01:28:59,220
Yeah.  Yeah.

889
01:29:01,804 --> 01:29:03,141
Okay.

890
01:29:04,406 --> 01:29:06,899
Yeah, I guess it is kind of 
silly when you think about it.

891
01:29:08,627 --> 01:29:11,502
Scholar.  The tree of knowledge. [laughs]
