00:01:54,637 --> 00:01:57,908
- Good morning.
- Fuck you.

3
00:02:33,075 --> 00:02:34,779
- Hey.
- Hey.

4
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,163
Hold this.

5
00:03:36,507 --> 00:03:38,075
Clear the ice!

6
00:03:40,577 --> 00:03:43,712
Lily! What are you doin'?

7
00:03:43,714 --> 00:03:47,484
Get off! Come on, bro!

8
00:03:49,652 --> 00:03:51,952
Sean... what the hell, man?!

9
00:03:51,954 --> 00:03:53,990
We're in the middle...

10
00:03:59,295 --> 00:04:02,297
Let's go!

11
00:04:02,299 --> 00:04:04,902
Sean, come on, man!

12
00:04:15,579 --> 00:04:19,780
So, honey, um, guess
who I ran into today.

13
00:04:19,782 --> 00:04:23,184
Sue, George's mother...
do you remember George?

14
00:04:23,186 --> 00:04:25,857
You went to science camp with
him. He was he smart kid.

15
00:04:27,558 --> 00:04:29,256
I don't remember.

16
00:04:29,258 --> 00:04:32,227
Curious George, that's what
you called him.

17
00:04:32,229 --> 00:04:36,064
Anyway, he remembers you
very fondly from science camp.

18
00:04:36,066 --> 00:04:38,566
- So, I was thinking that maybe...
- No.

19
00:04:38,568 --> 00:04:42,636
Um, Maria, you don't even know
what I was going to say next.

20
00:04:42,638 --> 00:04:44,542
Just... don't.

21
00:04:47,777 --> 00:04:49,677
Fine, if you don't want to hear
the rest of what...

22
00:04:49,679 --> 00:04:52,179
- I was gonna say, that's fine.
- No, she does.

23
00:04:52,181 --> 00:04:55,717
You know your mother's trying
to be helpful, right?

24
00:04:55,719 --> 00:04:57,855
Right?

25
00:04:59,121 --> 00:05:01,057
Yes.

26
00:05:02,592 --> 00:05:05,193
Here was my idea, just that
you're here and George...

27
00:05:05,195 --> 00:05:07,595
is here and and you both like
each other...

28
00:05:07,597 --> 00:05:10,764
so the winter prom is coming up,
you could go to it together.

29
00:05:10,766 --> 00:05:13,667
- I'm not going to the prom.
- Why not?

30
00:05:13,669 --> 00:05:17,138
Because it's stupid and I
don't want any part of it.

31
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:19,674
But it's such a
beautiful tradition.

32
00:05:19,676 --> 00:05:21,977
You're really gonna be missing
out, it's your senior year.

33
00:05:21,979 --> 00:05:23,881
Missing out on what?!

34
00:05:36,826 --> 00:05:39,259
That went well.

35
00:05:39,261 --> 00:05:41,763
I guess she just needs time
to come out of her shell.

36
00:05:41,765 --> 00:05:43,030
Christ, Amy, she's nearly 18.

37
00:05:43,032 --> 00:05:45,066
Well, she's a late bloomer.

38
00:05:45,068 --> 00:05:48,703
- She has no friends.
- She's friends with Lily.

39
00:05:48,705 --> 00:05:50,338
Lily's a habit, not a friend.

40
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:53,107
She has no social life.
She has no confidence.

41
00:05:53,109 --> 00:05:54,675
As far as I'm aware...

42
00:05:54,677 --> 00:05:56,710
she's never even had a
conversation with a boy.

43
00:05:56,712 --> 00:05:57,679
She doesn't touch her food.

44
00:05:57,681 --> 00:05:59,413
She weighs less than
she did two years ago.

45
00:05:59,415 --> 00:06:04,985
Wake up, Amy! Just look at her!
Look at her!

46
00:06:04,987 --> 00:06:06,687
We have a screwed-up daughter.

47
00:06:06,689 --> 00:06:09,323
You're too hard on her...

48
00:06:09,325 --> 00:06:12,694
you just need to give
her time to blossom.

49
00:06:12,696 --> 00:06:16,299
Blossom into what?

50
00:10:12,668 --> 00:10:15,602
Hey, sweetie.

51
00:10:15,604 --> 00:10:18,072
Dad, um....

52
00:10:18,074 --> 00:10:20,341
- Mm-hm?
- Last night...

53
00:10:20,343 --> 00:10:22,910
I don't really know what
to make of it...

54
00:10:22,912 --> 00:10:26,146
but I... I just wanted to ask
you something.

55
00:10:26,148 --> 00:10:28,650
Did you get any sleep?

56
00:10:28,652 --> 00:10:31,685
Yeah, I... well, I mean...

57
00:10:31,687 --> 00:10:33,154
I mean, no I didn't sleep well
last night.

58
00:10:33,156 --> 00:10:34,655
You look terrible.

59
00:10:34,657 --> 00:10:36,457
You sure you wanna go to
school looking like that?

60
00:10:36,459 --> 00:10:37,925
What?

61
00:10:37,927 --> 00:10:39,694
Honey, look, I know it's
a jungle out there...

62
00:10:39,696 --> 00:10:42,130
but you gotta put your best
face forward.

63
00:10:42,132 --> 00:10:44,265
- Don't you wanna look your best?
- I do, but I...

64
00:10:44,267 --> 00:10:45,967
What's going on?

65
00:10:45,969 --> 00:10:49,036
She didn't get any sleep...
again.

66
00:10:49,038 --> 00:10:51,305
Look, a good night's sleep is
essential for all of us...

67
00:10:51,307 --> 00:10:54,174
but particularly for a
young girl who's growing.

68
00:10:54,176 --> 00:10:55,443
Why don't you do
yourself a favor?

69
00:10:55,445 --> 00:10:58,378
Hop upstairs, put
some make-up on.

70
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:00,048
You'll look better
and you'll feel better.

71
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:01,115
Promise you, trust me.

72
00:11:01,117 --> 00:11:03,351
But her omelette
will get all cold.

73
00:11:03,353 --> 00:11:04,955
We both know she's not
gonna eat the omelette.

74
00:11:05,622 --> 00:11:07,124
Go on, upstairs.

75
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,193
Honey, what's wrong?

76
00:11:12,195 --> 00:11:15,963
Sweetie, go... now.

77
00:11:15,965 --> 00:11:17,200
Never mind.

78
00:12:49,225 --> 00:12:51,559
Good morning.

79
00:12:51,561 --> 00:12:54,295
Hey.

80
00:12:54,297 --> 00:12:57,131
So, what do you think?

81
00:12:57,133 --> 00:13:02,203
- It's nice.
- Nice?

82
00:13:02,205 --> 00:13:05,372
Okay, it's... it's really nice.

83
00:13:05,374 --> 00:13:07,141
Nice is a boy you
don't wanna go out with.

84
00:13:07,143 --> 00:13:14,082
This is an acid green,
turbo-charged 911.

85
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:15,415
This is definitely not nice.

86
00:13:18,687 --> 00:13:20,723
Woo! Woohoo! Woo!

87
00:13:31,533 --> 00:13:35,104
Yeah, I'm coming!

88
00:13:40,143 --> 00:13:42,676
Whoa.

89
00:13:42,678 --> 00:13:45,146
Sorry, Maria.

90
00:13:45,148 --> 00:13:48,152
Sweet ride. Hey, baby.

91
00:14:01,364 --> 00:14:03,367
That's not funny.

92
00:14:09,471 --> 00:14:11,204
Are you okay? I'm so sorry.

93
00:14:11,206 --> 00:14:13,210
I really didn't mean to do that.

94
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:19,146
Maybe she should
watch where she's going.

95
00:14:19,148 --> 00:14:20,780
You all right?

96
00:14:20,782 --> 00:14:25,556
Wow, Sean, your bar has
really lowered, huh?

97
00:14:26,755 --> 00:14:28,322
You fuck with...!

98
00:14:28,324 --> 00:14:30,857
Oy! Chill! Back up, Paul.

99
00:14:30,859 --> 00:14:34,161
- Hey, baby, it's not worth it.
- Fuckin' punk.

100
00:14:34,163 --> 00:14:37,330
- See you at practice.
- Seriously?

101
00:14:37,332 --> 00:14:39,266
Little bitch! Light's out!

102
00:14:39,268 --> 00:14:42,239
- You okay?
- Yeah.

103
00:14:43,907 --> 00:14:46,609
- Should we go?
- Okay.

104
00:15:47,336 --> 00:15:50,340
<i>Maria.</i>

105
00:15:53,008 --> 00:15:54,945
<i>Maria.</i>

106
00:17:04,313 --> 00:17:05,881
You're not real.

107
00:17:09,351 --> 00:17:11,455
I'm imagining you.

108
00:17:15,524 --> 00:17:18,461
Why am I seeing you?

109
00:17:20,362 --> 00:17:22,898
Because I'm here.

110
00:17:25,501 --> 00:17:29,306
Who... who are you?

111
00:17:32,341 --> 00:17:34,642
You don't remember me?

112
00:17:34,644 --> 00:17:38,713
- I don't know you.
- I've always been here.

113
00:17:38,715 --> 00:17:43,684
Look in the window...
I'm everywhere where you are.

114
00:17:43,686 --> 00:17:48,856
Whenever you see yourself,
what you really see is me.

115
00:17:48,858 --> 00:17:51,024
How long have you been here?

116
00:17:51,026 --> 00:17:53,394
How long have you?

117
00:17:53,396 --> 00:17:55,762
- What do you want?
- What do you want?

118
00:17:55,764 --> 00:17:58,467
What do you want from me?

119
00:17:59,502 --> 00:18:03,404
I can take your sadness away.

120
00:18:03,406 --> 00:18:09,876
Listen, I'm here for you,
I know you.

121
00:18:09,878 --> 00:18:14,482
I know your secret
desires, your fears...

122
00:18:14,484 --> 00:18:18,754
who you love, who you hate.

123
00:18:20,455 --> 00:18:23,656
I understand you completely.

124
00:18:23,658 --> 00:18:27,560
- But you aren't me?
- No.

125
00:18:27,562 --> 00:18:30,530
- Who are you then?
- Look at me.

126
00:18:30,532 --> 00:18:34,501
- What?
- Look at me.

127
00:18:34,503 --> 00:18:35,770
What do you see?

128
00:18:35,772 --> 00:18:39,507
I s... I see what I look like.

129
00:18:39,509 --> 00:18:41,511
What do you look like?

130
00:18:48,451 --> 00:18:54,358
I... you're beautiful.

131
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:59,528
We are beautiful.

132
00:19:06,601 --> 00:19:08,938
Do you have a name?

133
00:19:11,139 --> 00:19:13,441
Airam.

134
00:19:13,443 --> 00:19:15,045
Airam.

135
00:19:31,793 --> 00:19:33,092
Hey.

136
00:19:33,094 --> 00:19:37,865
Honey, you lookin' really
good today.

137
00:19:37,867 --> 00:19:42,669
Yeah, I see it, you had your
beauty sleep, I can tell.

138
00:19:42,671 --> 00:19:45,473
- Yeah.
- Mm-hm.

139
00:19:45,475 --> 00:19:47,741
Good for you, honey.

140
00:19:47,743 --> 00:19:51,544
Um, I've decided I'm gonna go
to the winter prom after all.

141
00:19:51,546 --> 00:19:53,914
- Yeah?
- Mm-hm.

142
00:19:53,916 --> 00:19:57,684
Honey, that's wonderful.
So who's the lucky guy?

143
00:19:57,686 --> 00:20:00,588
- No one.
- No one yet.

144
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:04,558
You know, the main thing
is that she's going. Right?

145
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:07,496
Which is great. You're making an
effort to be part of something.

146
00:20:17,173 --> 00:20:18,606
Hey, Lily.

147
00:20:18,608 --> 00:20:22,510
Hey, are we gonna hit
the ice today?

148
00:20:22,512 --> 00:20:24,211
You wanna learn how to skate?

149
00:20:24,213 --> 00:20:26,579
Yeah, I'm teaching her
for winter prom.

150
00:20:26,581 --> 00:20:29,183
Oh, that's great, who are you
going with?

151
00:20:29,185 --> 00:20:31,754
No one... yet.

152
00:20:34,023 --> 00:20:35,990
So are we gonna skate
today or...?

153
00:20:35,992 --> 00:20:39,792
Oh shit, no, um, it's Thursday.

154
00:20:39,794 --> 00:20:44,264
I have that bonding date
with my dad.

155
00:20:44,266 --> 00:20:46,032
You Brennans are so weird.

156
00:20:46,034 --> 00:20:47,937
You don't know the half of it.

157
00:20:50,138 --> 00:20:51,605
Okay, well, tomorrow then?

158
00:20:51,607 --> 00:20:54,610
Tomorrow.

159
00:20:56,712 --> 00:20:58,678
She wants to learn how to skate?

160
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:02,081
- Yeah, you wanna teach her?
- No.

161
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:04,220
It's just not like her,
that's all.

162
00:21:39,621 --> 00:21:41,955
He's just with a patient,
take a seat, darling.

163
00:21:41,957 --> 00:21:43,723
- He'll be right out.
- Okay.

164
00:21:43,725 --> 00:21:44,895
Okay.

165
00:21:50,899 --> 00:21:53,235
That's 278.

166
00:21:54,971 --> 00:21:59,876
And this one is... 286.

167
00:22:01,744 --> 00:22:02,809
- May I?
- Yes.

168
00:22:02,811 --> 00:22:04,377
Thank you.

169
00:22:04,379 --> 00:22:07,380
What we're gonna do is we are
going to relocate...

170
00:22:07,382 --> 00:22:13,289
your nipples back up here
where they belong.

171
00:22:14,657 --> 00:22:17,691
Slip an implant under here
and here...

172
00:22:17,693 --> 00:22:20,763
and they are gonna be perky
and perfect.

173
00:22:32,207 --> 00:22:34,875
So how's school, Maria?

174
00:22:34,877 --> 00:22:36,175
It's good.

175
00:22:36,177 --> 00:22:38,779
You're lucky to be
in high school.

176
00:22:38,781 --> 00:22:40,380
I miss that time so much.

177
00:22:40,382 --> 00:22:45,284
No worries, all you care about
are guys, right?

178
00:22:45,286 --> 00:22:48,755
Naomi, could you go through the
forms with Ms. Robinson, please?

179
00:22:48,757 --> 00:22:50,156
And schedule a mammoplasty...

180
00:22:50,158 --> 00:22:52,225
and an abdominoplasty
for a few weeks.

181
00:22:52,227 --> 00:22:55,294
Hey, hun... hi.

182
00:22:55,296 --> 00:22:56,829
- Hi.
- Claudia.

183
00:22:56,831 --> 00:22:58,398
Do we have an appointment today?

184
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,268
No, I just wanted to see
if it's coming along okay.

185
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:04,104
Please?

186
00:23:04,106 --> 00:23:07,307
I really can't today,
my daughter's here for a date.

187
00:23:07,309 --> 00:23:09,842
You're here early, aren't you?
Did we not say 6:00?

188
00:23:09,844 --> 00:23:12,046
Yeah, sorry.

189
00:23:12,048 --> 00:23:15,315
Can't you squeeze me
in for like ten minutes?

190
00:23:15,317 --> 00:23:18,819
Why don't I just check
it right now? Here we go.

191
00:23:18,821 --> 00:23:22,690
All right, here we go.

192
00:23:22,692 --> 00:23:26,997
That is looking just fine.

193
00:23:33,802 --> 00:23:35,868
<i>I'll remember you
just like this.</i>

194
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:38,972
<i>Yeah.</i>

195
00:23:47,882 --> 00:23:49,450
<i>I thought this weekend
would never come.</i>

196
00:23:49,452 --> 00:23:55,055
<i>Me, too. I love you so much.</i>

197
00:23:55,057 --> 00:23:56,893
<i>I love you, too.</i>

198
00:24:14,877 --> 00:24:16,809
Are you okay, honey?

199
00:24:16,811 --> 00:24:18,113
Yeah.

200
00:24:19,281 --> 00:24:20,280
- Oh.
- Hey.

201
00:24:20,282 --> 00:24:24,751
Maria, hey, oh, what's good?

202
00:24:24,753 --> 00:24:27,921
I don't think we've ever met
before, you must be Dr. Brennan.

203
00:24:27,923 --> 00:24:30,124
- And you are?
- Mark.

204
00:24:30,126 --> 00:24:32,492
It's a pleasure to meet you,
Doctor.

205
00:24:32,494 --> 00:24:35,294
I'm actually considering
going into pre-med myself.

206
00:24:35,296 --> 00:24:37,463
I'd love to sit down with
you, pick your brain sometime...

207
00:24:37,465 --> 00:24:40,299
if that wouldn't be too much
trouble.

208
00:24:40,301 --> 00:24:41,568
Sure.

209
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:45,708
Great, and Maria, I guess I'll
just see you around in school.

210
00:25:07,897 --> 00:25:09,733
That was brutal.

211
00:25:21,342 --> 00:25:25,311
You know, your birthday's
coming up in a couple months.

212
00:25:25,313 --> 00:25:27,146
What would you say to getting
your gift...

213
00:25:27,148 --> 00:25:29,883
a little early this year?

214
00:25:29,885 --> 00:25:31,484
I... I'd say yes.

215
00:25:31,486 --> 00:25:34,387
Swing by the office tomorrow
after school.

216
00:25:34,389 --> 00:25:35,792
Sure.

217
00:25:39,294 --> 00:25:40,927
Daddy.

218
00:25:40,929 --> 00:25:42,865
What?

219
00:25:45,067 --> 00:25:46,770
Never mind.

220
00:26:12,628 --> 00:26:14,964
You really believe he cares,
don't you?

221
00:26:19,334 --> 00:26:22,204
- He does.
- Oh, come on, Maria.

222
00:26:24,039 --> 00:26:27,473
He was embarrassed, that's all.

223
00:26:27,475 --> 00:26:31,979
You're just a stain on his
family.

224
00:26:31,981 --> 00:26:34,348
No, you're wrong.

225
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:37,017
He does care and he's gonna
buy me my car early...

226
00:26:37,019 --> 00:26:38,918
because he doesn't want me
riding the bus...

227
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,119
with those idiots anymore.

228
00:26:40,121 --> 00:26:43,025
- You heard him.
- I heard him.

229
00:26:44,659 --> 00:26:46,326
What do you know anyway?

230
00:26:46,328 --> 00:26:48,431
Nothing that you don't already.

231
00:26:49,965 --> 00:26:52,598
Shh.

232
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:55,338
You know, you're
overreacting, okay?

233
00:27:12,021 --> 00:27:13,921
You ready?

234
00:27:13,923 --> 00:27:15,859
Is it in there?

235
00:27:18,627 --> 00:27:20,363
Come on.

236
00:27:26,135 --> 00:27:28,301
It's here.

237
00:27:28,303 --> 00:27:29,936
What?

238
00:27:29,938 --> 00:27:35,107
I know who you see
in the mirror.

239
00:27:35,109 --> 00:27:37,109
It doesn't matter what's real.

240
00:27:37,111 --> 00:27:39,413
What matters is how you feel...

241
00:27:39,415 --> 00:27:44,253
and I wanna make you feel
beautiful.

242
00:27:52,962 --> 00:27:56,296
I'm your dad, think I don't know
why you don't wear your hair...

243
00:27:56,298 --> 00:27:58,568
back in a ponytail? Hm.

244
00:28:00,601 --> 00:28:04,172
So, here's what I'm gonna do.

245
00:28:06,641 --> 00:28:12,547
Take this, which is eight
millimeters...

246
00:28:16,685 --> 00:28:21,053
and this, which is six.

247
00:28:21,055 --> 00:28:24,057
We're gonna round the top
of these pointy bits off...

248
00:28:24,059 --> 00:28:27,394
and they're gonna be amazing.

249
00:28:27,396 --> 00:28:31,033
Then, here, lift 'em.

250
00:28:32,634 --> 00:28:35,068
I know.

251
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:40,139
Yeah, we're gonna take this
sweet, little snub nose...

252
00:28:40,141 --> 00:28:44,444
we're just gonna slim down
the cartilage at the top...

253
00:28:44,446 --> 00:28:48,214
and just extend the tip
a teeny bit.

254
00:28:48,216 --> 00:28:51,050
It's gonna look sophisticated
and amazing...

255
00:28:51,052 --> 00:28:54,221
and we're gonna accentuate the
cupid's bow...

256
00:28:54,223 --> 00:28:56,088
show those fabulous teeth...

257
00:28:56,090 --> 00:28:59,262
and let that smile come
shining through.

258
00:29:00,596 --> 00:29:05,365
And that's my gift to you.

259
00:29:05,367 --> 00:29:08,404
Say yes.

260
00:29:09,303 --> 00:29:13,072
- Yes.
- Yeah?

261
00:29:13,074 --> 00:29:16,076
Mm-hm.

262
00:29:16,078 --> 00:29:18,414
Let's go eat.

263
00:29:49,778 --> 00:29:51,711
You were right.

264
00:29:51,713 --> 00:29:56,082
You have no one taking
care of you out there.

265
00:29:56,084 --> 00:29:59,251
Well, there's Mom.

266
00:29:59,253 --> 00:30:00,654
She's weak.

267
00:30:00,656 --> 00:30:03,690
She'll do everything he tells
her, and you know why.

268
00:30:03,692 --> 00:30:08,194
Because she still thinks
he gives a shit about her.

269
00:30:08,196 --> 00:30:10,600
That's right.

270
00:30:13,234 --> 00:30:15,335
God, they really are something.
Aren't they?

271
00:30:15,337 --> 00:30:18,338
Hm. I mean, he doesn't
give a fuck and she...

272
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:20,208
Desperately needs one.

273
00:30:27,182 --> 00:30:30,783
Mom, don't you know
you're supposed to knock?

274
00:30:32,454 --> 00:30:34,588
- Who were you talking to?
- No one.

275
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:40,460
- I just heard you!
- It's no one.

276
00:30:40,462 --> 00:30:41,664
I thought of something funny.

277
00:30:45,567 --> 00:30:48,503
Are you smoking pot in here?

278
00:30:51,807 --> 00:30:54,143
What are you doing?

279
00:30:57,579 --> 00:30:59,648
What's wrong with you?

280
00:31:03,886 --> 00:31:05,217
Maybe she was on the phone.

281
00:31:05,219 --> 00:31:06,685
No! I w... I was in there
with her!

282
00:31:06,687 --> 00:31:08,320
It was as though there was
someone else there...

283
00:31:08,322 --> 00:31:10,757
in the room with her and she was
laughing strangely...

284
00:31:10,759 --> 00:31:12,591
and I tried to get through
to her, but I couldn't.

285
00:31:12,593 --> 00:31:14,226
- Okay, okay. Ssh-ssh... okay.
- Are you listening to me, Dan?

286
00:31:14,228 --> 00:31:16,562
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm listening to you.

287
00:31:16,564 --> 00:31:18,531
She has problems, okay?
We know this.

288
00:31:18,533 --> 00:31:20,166
- No, but...
- This is not news.

289
00:31:20,168 --> 00:31:22,202
Oh, come on. I don't need that.
That's not...

290
00:31:22,204 --> 00:31:23,669
Please hear me out.

291
00:31:23,671 --> 00:31:25,371
Please! I have a very strong
feeling about this.

292
00:31:25,373 --> 00:31:26,839
- You're having a panic attack.
- If you would've seen this...

293
00:31:26,841 --> 00:31:28,375
- Amy! Amy!
- I'm not! I'm not!

294
00:31:28,377 --> 00:31:32,447
Amy, stop, breathe.
Let me help you.

295
00:31:37,753 --> 00:31:39,722
Open up.

296
00:31:41,523 --> 00:31:44,627
Drink up... look.

297
00:31:48,463 --> 00:31:52,799
Okay, now get your breath back,
it's gonna be alright.

298
00:31:52,801 --> 00:31:54,701
Everything's gonna be alright.
You know why?

299
00:31:54,703 --> 00:31:56,302
Why?

300
00:31:56,304 --> 00:31:58,672
'Cause I know what I'm doing
and I'm taking care of it.

301
00:31:58,674 --> 00:32:01,340
- Do you believe me?
- Yeah.

302
00:32:01,342 --> 00:32:02,375
Okay.

303
00:32:02,377 --> 00:32:05,278
Ssh-ssh.

304
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,282
Alright.

305
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:13,321
Ssh.

306
00:32:23,432 --> 00:32:26,700
They've come back.

307
00:32:26,702 --> 00:32:28,838
The dreams?

308
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:38,380
Well, they'll go away,
they always do.

309
00:32:40,715 --> 00:32:43,619
But then they always come back.

310
00:33:50,051 --> 00:33:51,984
Oh, the old club house.

311
00:33:51,986 --> 00:33:53,853
We haven't been here
since we were like four.

312
00:33:53,855 --> 00:33:56,623
Yeah, no one really
comes now that it's closed.

313
00:33:56,625 --> 00:33:59,358
It's a shame, it's really
pretty.

314
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:00,393
Yeah.

315
00:34:00,395 --> 00:34:04,496
- Should we put these on?
- Okay.

316
00:34:04,498 --> 00:34:06,665
That's it! That's it!

317
00:34:06,667 --> 00:34:08,634
Now, I'm gonna let go of you,
okay?

318
00:34:08,636 --> 00:34:11,337
No, Lily, wait. Don't. Please.

319
00:34:11,339 --> 00:34:13,473
We're just gonna go to the club
house, it's fine.

320
00:34:13,475 --> 00:34:14,840
- Okay?
- No.

321
00:34:14,842 --> 00:34:16,076
No, no, no, no, no.
Don't. Don't. Don't.

322
00:34:16,078 --> 00:34:20,512
Look at me. You're gonna have
to do it on your own eventually.

323
00:34:20,514 --> 00:34:23,483
You can't hold on to me forever.

324
00:34:23,485 --> 00:34:28,355
- Okay.
- Okay? That's it, come on.

325
00:34:28,357 --> 00:34:29,358
Head up! Head up!

326
00:34:31,625 --> 00:34:33,962
No, I can't, I can't do this.

327
00:34:40,701 --> 00:34:45,440
Ow! Lily, come on, help me up.

328
00:34:47,542 --> 00:34:50,442
- He's mine, you know?
- What? Who?

329
00:34:50,444 --> 00:34:52,978
You know who I'm talking about.

330
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:55,350
No, I don't.

331
00:34:59,721 --> 00:35:02,054
Where are you going?

332
00:35:02,056 --> 00:35:03,491
Lily!

333
00:35:08,964 --> 00:35:10,565
Lily, come on!

334
00:35:11,933 --> 00:35:13,869
Lily!

335
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:54,808
You wanna believe in it,
don't you?

336
00:35:54,810 --> 00:35:57,744
What?

337
00:35:57,746 --> 00:36:01,581
That she's your friend,
that she cares about you.

338
00:36:01,583 --> 00:36:03,882
She is my friend.

339
00:36:03,884 --> 00:36:06,552
But you're not so sure of that
now, are you?

340
00:36:06,554 --> 00:36:09,621
We've been best friends
since we were three.

341
00:36:09,623 --> 00:36:12,491
I was there too, remember?

342
00:36:12,493 --> 00:36:15,594
I remember when she left
you alone in the sand box.

343
00:36:15,596 --> 00:36:17,063
All alone, by yourself...

344
00:36:17,065 --> 00:36:19,098
because she wanted to play
with the other girls.

345
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:21,099
That never happened.

346
00:36:21,101 --> 00:36:23,802
I was there when you made a pact
not to sit next to each other...

347
00:36:23,804 --> 00:36:25,204
on the first day of grade
school.

348
00:36:25,206 --> 00:36:27,607
No, she was late that day.

349
00:36:27,609 --> 00:36:31,677
- The teacher seated her next to...
- No!

350
00:36:31,679 --> 00:36:35,614
She was there before you
arrived, Maria...

351
00:36:35,616 --> 00:36:37,916
sitting next to little Chloe...

352
00:36:37,918 --> 00:36:42,020
acting like she didn't know
who you were.

353
00:36:42,022 --> 00:36:44,724
And poor little you,
you were there...

354
00:36:44,726 --> 00:36:46,625
in your little, pink dress...

355
00:36:46,627 --> 00:36:50,963
because she told you it made you
look as pretty as a princess.

356
00:36:50,965 --> 00:36:54,569
You didn't remember that,
did you?

357
00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:05,911
But I do, I remember all
of those moments.

358
00:37:05,913 --> 00:37:08,748
I remember when she'd laugh
behind your back...

359
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:11,817
and roll her eyes when you
weren't looking.

360
00:37:11,819 --> 00:37:13,955
I remember all of those things.

361
00:37:16,757 --> 00:37:19,125
All of those things
that you choose to forget.

362
00:37:19,127 --> 00:37:22,594
Just like you wanted to forget
her leaving you...

363
00:37:22,596 --> 00:37:24,530
lying on the ice today.

364
00:37:24,532 --> 00:37:26,532
No. No. No.

365
00:37:26,534 --> 00:37:28,067
But I won't let
you forget, Maria...

366
00:37:28,069 --> 00:37:31,873
because that's
what real friends do.

367
00:37:35,576 --> 00:37:36,978
They share their pain.

368
00:37:40,181 --> 00:37:44,683
And you have so
much inside of you.

369
00:37:44,685 --> 00:37:47,055
But I can take all of
those feelings away.

370
00:37:50,958 --> 00:37:56,031
Trust me, and you trust
in yourself.

371
00:37:57,331 --> 00:38:02,071
Let me help you, be there
for you...

372
00:38:03,203 --> 00:38:05,273
instead of you.

373
00:38:13,647 --> 00:38:15,149
Come on.

374
00:38:16,585 --> 00:38:17,817
I can fix things.

375
00:38:25,659 --> 00:38:27,996
Give me your other hand.

376
00:38:38,339 --> 00:38:40,275
Kiss me.

377
00:38:50,618 --> 00:38:53,186
Maria?

378
00:38:53,188 --> 00:38:54,954
Yeah, Mom?

379
00:38:54,956 --> 00:38:59,161
I have a surprise for you.
Open up.

380
00:39:02,096 --> 00:39:07,366
This is your time to shine.
Look.

381
00:39:07,368 --> 00:39:12,105
Look at you, like an angel.

382
00:39:12,107 --> 00:39:15,375
Honey, I want you to promise
me something, okay?

383
00:39:15,377 --> 00:39:19,047
Will you promise me that
you will have a good time?

384
00:39:22,683 --> 00:39:24,619
Can you promise me that?

385
00:39:26,221 --> 00:39:29,090
Please, darling,
please promise me.

386
00:39:30,692 --> 00:39:33,659
I promise.

387
00:40:11,065 --> 00:40:14,701
Yeah! Whoo!

388
00:40:14,703 --> 00:40:16,205
Hey, watch it!

389
00:40:20,875 --> 00:40:22,277
Nice!

390
00:40:47,268 --> 00:40:49,170
You want to go?

391
00:42:02,810 --> 00:42:04,976
- What are you doing?
- Let go of me!

392
00:42:04,978 --> 00:42:07,381
No!

393
00:42:24,565 --> 00:42:25,831
- Woo!
- Agh!

394
00:42:25,833 --> 00:42:27,833
Woo-hoo! Fun!

395
00:42:27,835 --> 00:42:31,270
Stop! Agh!

396
00:42:31,272 --> 00:42:33,438
Somebody help her!

397
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:36,043
Do it! Do it!

398
00:42:40,181 --> 00:42:42,518
Hey, watch out!

399
00:42:47,922 --> 00:42:50,092
You're such a jerk!

400
00:42:54,962 --> 00:42:57,498
Is she okay?

401
00:43:16,583 --> 00:43:19,886
Airam?

402
00:43:19,888 --> 00:43:22,190
Airam, are you there?

403
00:43:24,525 --> 00:43:27,029
Airam, I need you now.

404
00:43:30,063 --> 00:43:32,033
Please come back.

405
00:43:35,936 --> 00:43:38,473
Please come back, I need you.

406
00:43:49,683 --> 00:43:51,519
Maria.

407
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:06,267
Now... let me take your pain
away.

408
00:44:13,007 --> 00:44:15,210
Just close your eyes...

409
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:21,583
and kiss me.

410
00:46:12,493 --> 00:46:15,161
Agh!

411
00:46:15,163 --> 00:46:16,531
Oh, it hurts!

412
00:46:21,368 --> 00:46:23,735
Agh, something's wrong! Agh!

413
00:46:23,737 --> 00:46:26,507
Help me! Agh!

414
00:47:20,761 --> 00:47:22,261
So how was it?

415
00:47:22,263 --> 00:47:24,295
How was what?

416
00:47:24,297 --> 00:47:26,467
The prom.

417
00:47:28,302 --> 00:47:32,174
It was perfect, just perfect.

418
00:47:33,306 --> 00:47:34,739
That's so great.

419
00:47:34,741 --> 00:47:37,442
So, tell me more. Did you
have a fabulous time?

420
00:47:37,444 --> 00:47:40,612
Did you... did you dance
with anyone?

421
00:47:40,614 --> 00:47:44,916
Mom, it was everything
I wished for.

422
00:47:44,918 --> 00:47:47,920
- I'm starving!
- We have fresh bagels.

423
00:47:47,922 --> 00:47:49,257
Mm!

424
00:47:53,728 --> 00:47:56,865
Well, someone's got
her appetite back.

425
00:47:58,498 --> 00:48:01,168
I'm sorry, I haven't been
myself lately.

426
00:48:07,909 --> 00:48:09,711
Mm!

427
00:48:54,889 --> 00:48:57,956
- Oh shit.
- Shut up.

428
00:48:57,958 --> 00:48:59,460
Morning, ice queen.

429
00:49:00,962 --> 00:49:02,464
Oh, shit.

430
00:49:08,469 --> 00:49:10,804
Whoo! Yeah! Ha-ha!

431
00:49:23,317 --> 00:49:25,619
You're not laughing.

432
00:49:30,790 --> 00:49:34,862
What? Am I not funny anymore?

433
00:49:41,302 --> 00:49:44,706
Or is that 'cause you get a
hard on every time you see me?

434
00:49:57,384 --> 00:49:59,751
Dude, what happened?

435
00:49:59,753 --> 00:50:02,790
- She was feeling you up.
- Shut the fuck up, man!

436
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:07,862
Hey!

437
00:50:09,929 --> 00:50:12,463
- You okay?
- Mm-hm.

438
00:50:12,465 --> 00:50:14,433
What happened back there?

439
00:50:14,435 --> 00:50:16,302
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

440
00:50:16,304 --> 00:50:20,538
He's still shaking, what...
what'd you say to him?

441
00:50:20,540 --> 00:50:24,311
Uh, I told him...

442
00:50:29,884 --> 00:50:31,586
Wow. Uh...

443
00:50:32,886 --> 00:50:38,824
Oh, um, I think this belongs
to you.

444
00:50:38,826 --> 00:50:39,994
Oh.

445
00:50:41,761 --> 00:50:44,797
Well, what are you doing?

446
00:50:44,799 --> 00:50:48,500
I was just giving Maria her pin
back.

447
00:50:48,502 --> 00:50:49,871
See ya.

448
00:50:59,380 --> 00:51:01,612
Are you okay?

449
00:51:01,614 --> 00:51:03,782
I'm so sorry about what
happened last night.

450
00:51:03,784 --> 00:51:07,719
That was... it was fucking wrong.

451
00:51:07,721 --> 00:51:12,358
- Was it?
- Yeah, it was shameful.

452
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:16,464
Is that what you felt? Shame?

453
00:51:18,898 --> 00:51:21,833
Hey, look, I didn't do
anything wrong. Okay?

454
00:51:21,835 --> 00:51:24,605
- I tried to stop them, but...
- Sure.

455
00:51:29,476 --> 00:51:32,511
You're not quitting on me now,
are you?

456
00:51:32,513 --> 00:51:34,045
Quitting?

457
00:51:34,047 --> 00:51:36,514
You said you were
gonna teach me to skate.

458
00:51:36,516 --> 00:51:39,851
You still want to?

459
00:51:39,853 --> 00:51:41,520
Why not?

460
00:51:41,522 --> 00:51:43,822
Well, after prom...

461
00:51:43,824 --> 00:51:46,561
What's the point, Maria?

462
00:51:48,628 --> 00:51:50,864
Self-improvement.

463
00:52:51,491 --> 00:52:53,894
Hey, honey. What's up?

464
00:52:57,063 --> 00:52:58,864
Hi, Daddy.

465
00:52:58,866 --> 00:53:01,136
Hey.

466
00:53:04,839 --> 00:53:07,505
Did we have a lunch date
or something?

467
00:53:07,507 --> 00:53:09,843
Did I forget anything or...?

468
00:53:11,244 --> 00:53:15,016
Huh... okay, so?

469
00:53:35,101 --> 00:53:37,138
I missed you.

470
00:53:39,507 --> 00:53:41,940
That's nice.

471
00:53:41,942 --> 00:53:45,013
And I... I missed you, too.

472
00:53:47,748 --> 00:53:49,614
<i>Dr. Brennan?</i>

473
00:53:49,616 --> 00:53:53,050
- <i>Can I send in the next patient?</i>
- <i>Just hold on a second!</i>

474
00:53:53,052 --> 00:53:56,188
Sweetie, what's going on?

475
00:53:56,190 --> 00:53:58,023
Is something wrong? You need
something?

476
00:53:58,025 --> 00:54:00,595
I can... something I can do?

477
00:54:05,098 --> 00:54:08,769
All right, well, I guess
I'll see you at home.

478
00:54:24,817 --> 00:54:26,985
Sharon, he's ready for you.

479
00:54:26,987 --> 00:54:29,221
You want me to call you a cab?

480
00:54:29,223 --> 00:54:31,223
No, I'll take a bus.

481
00:54:31,225 --> 00:54:33,824
Hey, we don't have any more
of that delicious hot cocoa?

482
00:54:33,826 --> 00:54:36,561
You want me to fix you one
for the road?

483
00:54:36,563 --> 00:54:37,929
Hm...

484
00:54:37,931 --> 00:54:39,801
I'll take that as a yes.

485
00:55:00,119 --> 00:55:02,820
Hi, this is Dr. Brennan's
office.

486
00:55:02,822 --> 00:55:04,255
We have an opening for an
appointment...

487
00:55:04,257 --> 00:55:07,726
at 1:00 o'clock, if you're
interested?

488
00:55:07,728 --> 00:55:09,293
Great.

489
00:55:09,295 --> 00:55:11,632
We'll let him know
you're coming.

490
00:55:16,170 --> 00:55:19,605
I took the liberty of throwing
in some marshmallows.

491
00:55:19,607 --> 00:55:22,741
Mm. Thank you, oh,
and I almost forgot!

492
00:55:22,743 --> 00:55:24,643
Dad wants you to have Mom
pick him up here...

493
00:55:24,645 --> 00:55:27,346
for a romantic lunch date
at 1:00 o'clock.

494
00:55:27,348 --> 00:55:29,284
- Sure thing.
- Okay.

495
00:55:46,799 --> 00:55:51,369
Hello? Hi, Naomi.

496
00:55:51,371 --> 00:55:54,172
He does?

497
00:55:54,174 --> 00:55:57,375
Today?

498
00:55:57,377 --> 00:56:01,748
Yeah, he is the best.

499
00:56:03,384 --> 00:56:05,416
Okay... oh, in an hour.

500
00:56:05,418 --> 00:56:09,257
Okay, great, see you,
yeah okay, thanks.

501
00:57:01,875 --> 00:57:03,407
That's a pretty dress.

502
00:57:03,409 --> 00:57:06,880
Oh, thank you, it's Dr. Dan's
favorite.

503
00:57:28,435 --> 00:57:31,205
Where's Daddy?

504
00:57:34,808 --> 00:57:38,378
- Is he working late?
- Mm.

505
00:57:43,417 --> 00:57:46,751
Is he working late?

506
00:57:46,753 --> 00:57:50,058
Probably, yes.

507
00:57:51,958 --> 00:57:53,425
Uh, how's the tofu steak?

508
00:57:53,427 --> 00:57:55,893
It doesn't even look
like you've touched it.

509
00:57:55,895 --> 00:57:57,898
It's just like your marriage.

510
00:58:01,235 --> 00:58:02,400
What?

511
00:58:02,402 --> 00:58:06,007
A stale imitation of the real
thing.

512
00:58:07,875 --> 00:58:10,878
Have you lost your mind?

513
00:58:12,846 --> 00:58:14,779
Where's Dad?

514
00:58:14,781 --> 00:58:16,815
I just told you.

515
00:58:16,817 --> 00:58:18,516
He's probably got some extra
procedures...

516
00:58:18,518 --> 00:58:22,087
and he's going to be
at the office late.

517
00:58:22,089 --> 00:58:26,491
Please stop smiling at me
like that.

518
00:58:26,493 --> 00:58:31,163
Why don't you tell the truth?
It's so liberating.

519
00:58:31,165 --> 00:58:34,933
Try it.

520
00:58:34,935 --> 00:58:36,802
Dad is not working late.

521
00:58:36,804 --> 00:58:38,804
See?

522
00:58:38,806 --> 00:58:42,541
What are you talking about?

523
00:58:42,543 --> 00:58:46,311
- Say it.
- Say what?

524
00:58:46,313 --> 00:58:47,846
Just say that you're tired...

525
00:58:47,848 --> 00:58:50,351
of him fucking all those
other women.

526
00:58:57,156 --> 00:58:59,357
Oh, I'm sorry.

527
00:58:59,359 --> 00:59:02,295
I don't know what came over me,
I'm so sorry.

528
00:59:04,431 --> 00:59:05,532
I'm not.

529
00:59:12,973 --> 00:59:15,072
What are you looking at?

530
00:59:15,074 --> 00:59:17,208
What do you think you're doing?

531
00:59:17,210 --> 00:59:19,009
Having dinner with Mom.

532
00:59:19,011 --> 00:59:20,911
Why were you so mean to her?

533
00:59:20,913 --> 00:59:24,248
- Was I lying?
- No.

534
00:59:24,250 --> 00:59:27,219
Am I not doing what
you've always wanted to do?

535
00:59:27,221 --> 00:59:29,154
Saying what you've
always wanted to say?

536
00:59:29,156 --> 00:59:31,391
Everything you didn't dare.

537
00:59:32,525 --> 00:59:33,659
Maybe.

538
00:59:33,661 --> 00:59:37,228
It's about time for the truth
to surface, isn't it?

539
00:59:37,230 --> 00:59:38,329
I guess.

540
00:59:38,331 --> 00:59:43,034
Just follow me, stop resisting.

541
00:59:43,036 --> 00:59:45,904
She deserves it, they all do.

542
00:59:45,906 --> 00:59:48,105
It's time they learned that.

543
00:59:48,107 --> 00:59:51,812
- Learned what?
- That they've sinned.

544
00:59:53,045 --> 00:59:55,614
Against who?

545
00:59:55,616 --> 00:59:58,286
Against who?!

546
01:01:05,018 --> 01:01:07,154
You're dead.

547
01:01:21,268 --> 01:01:23,134
- See you later, man.
- See you.

548
01:01:23,136 --> 01:01:25,940
- Later, man.
- Yeah, late.

549
01:02:32,739 --> 01:02:38,175
Fuck! Aw! Fuck, my knee!

550
01:02:38,177 --> 01:02:40,114
Fuck!

551
01:02:42,581 --> 01:02:45,185
Agh! Fuck!

552
01:02:51,558 --> 01:02:53,627
Ssh.

553
01:03:22,355 --> 01:03:24,324
It's good to see you smiling.

554
01:03:50,217 --> 01:03:52,416
Okay.

555
01:03:52,418 --> 01:03:54,251
That's it. That's it!

556
01:03:54,253 --> 01:03:56,587
- Yeah?
- Yeah!

557
01:03:56,589 --> 01:03:59,324
Cool, yeah, that's it!

558
01:03:59,326 --> 01:04:01,395
Maria, that's great!

559
01:04:04,163 --> 01:04:06,399
Jeez, have you been practicing?

560
01:04:14,241 --> 01:04:15,576
Whoa.

561
01:04:21,514 --> 01:04:23,116
Whoa.

562
01:05:08,360 --> 01:05:10,531
Holy shit!

563
01:06:13,692 --> 01:06:14,727
Hm.

564
01:08:06,605 --> 01:08:08,373
Hello?! Can you please
come quick?!

565
01:08:08,375 --> 01:08:11,909
Yeah, I'm here with my friend
and she she's fallen and I...

566
01:08:11,911 --> 01:08:14,712
I think she's dead. Oh God!

567
01:08:14,714 --> 01:08:18,582
Um yeah, we're at the old
club house on Wellington.

568
01:08:18,584 --> 01:08:22,989
Please come quickly!
Please hurry.

569
01:08:28,395 --> 01:08:31,996
We still have a couple
questions for your daughter.

570
01:08:31,998 --> 01:08:35,436
Well, can it wait? I mean,
she's been through so much.

571
01:08:39,438 --> 01:08:43,975
Sure. We'll stay in touch.

572
01:08:43,977 --> 01:08:45,646
Thank you.

573
01:09:04,630 --> 01:09:07,564
Why are you doing this?

574
01:09:07,566 --> 01:09:10,069
Because you wanted me to.

575
01:09:11,704 --> 01:09:15,075
I don't. Do you hear me?!
I don't!

576
01:09:17,477 --> 01:09:23,584
I want you back here behind the
glass, back where you belong.

577
01:09:26,186 --> 01:09:30,656
I want out. I want out!

578
01:09:38,197 --> 01:09:41,565
Did you really want me to
risk our lives to save hers? Hm?

579
01:09:41,567 --> 01:09:44,836
Save? You pushed her to it.

580
01:09:44,838 --> 01:09:47,775
I didn't touch her.

581
01:09:49,741 --> 01:09:52,777
That's right, accidents happen.

582
01:09:52,779 --> 01:09:55,479
She brought this on herself.

583
01:09:55,481 --> 01:09:57,849
I didn't want this to happen.

584
01:09:57,851 --> 01:09:59,684
Can you look at me
and sincerely say...

585
01:09:59,686 --> 01:10:02,723
you want her back in your life?

586
01:10:04,790 --> 01:10:08,059
Good. There are no lies
between us.

587
01:10:08,061 --> 01:10:11,229
Remember, I'm doing all
of this for you.

588
01:10:11,231 --> 01:10:12,800
For us.

589
01:10:15,101 --> 01:10:20,674
Wait. Who are you?

590
01:10:26,612 --> 01:10:28,548
You know me.

591
01:11:27,673 --> 01:11:29,942
I'm sorry for your loss.

592
01:11:41,353 --> 01:11:44,220
- Hey.
- Hey.

593
01:11:44,222 --> 01:11:46,657
Where are you going?

594
01:11:46,659 --> 01:11:49,693
Home. I really can't...

595
01:11:49,695 --> 01:11:51,831
Handle it?

596
01:11:53,799 --> 01:11:59,172
I'm sorry, I um, I didn't
mean to just leave like that.

597
01:12:00,373 --> 01:12:02,543
Hey.

598
01:12:06,044 --> 01:12:09,814
- We'll pull through, yeah?
- Mm-hm.

599
01:12:09,816 --> 01:12:13,786
We're in this together.
You know that, right?

600
01:13:22,722 --> 01:13:25,025
Something for the pain?

601
01:13:41,173 --> 01:13:43,810
I didn't know you smoked weed.

602
01:13:44,744 --> 01:13:46,780
I do now.

603
01:13:59,926 --> 01:14:03,394
I just can't believe she's gone.

604
01:14:03,396 --> 01:14:09,166
I keep waiting for her to come
back and tell me...

605
01:14:09,168 --> 01:14:11,836
it's all just some kind of sick
joke or something.

606
01:14:11,838 --> 01:14:14,206
Stupid, isn't it?

607
01:14:16,275 --> 01:14:18,679
You're just sad, that's all.

608
01:14:24,750 --> 01:14:28,385
I know how that feels.

609
01:14:28,387 --> 01:14:31,924
Sometimes I think it's all
I know.

610
01:14:38,463 --> 01:14:39,932
Are you okay?

611
01:14:42,235 --> 01:14:45,005
Are you crying?

612
01:14:46,905 --> 01:14:50,908
I have a confession to make.

613
01:14:50,910 --> 01:14:53,413
What?

614
01:15:00,852 --> 01:15:07,457
All of those times when I was
with you and Lily...

615
01:15:07,459 --> 01:15:16,966
I'd look at her and I'd just
think, what would it be like...

616
01:15:16,968 --> 01:15:22,907
if it were you touching my hair,
kissing my lips?

617
01:15:22,909 --> 01:15:27,981
And then, when I was
alone with myself...

618
01:15:30,148 --> 01:15:32,218
I'd touch myself...

619
01:15:34,120 --> 01:15:38,956
and I'd imagine your hand
touching me all over.

620
01:15:38,958 --> 01:15:40,157
Stop.

621
01:15:40,159 --> 01:15:44,464
And I'd get so hot
thinking about it.

622
01:15:45,865 --> 01:15:47,834
Stop it.

623
01:15:50,203 --> 01:15:53,837
Maria... don't, it's wrong.

624
01:15:53,839 --> 01:15:54,971
Stop it.

625
01:15:54,973 --> 01:15:57,811
I can't stop now, Sean.

626
01:16:00,346 --> 01:16:02,281
Feel me.

627
01:17:06,678 --> 01:17:10,382
One special som tam salad.

628
01:17:14,387 --> 01:17:15,452
Mm.

629
01:17:15,454 --> 01:17:17,421
- You like?
- Mm-hm.

630
01:17:17,423 --> 01:17:20,056
Not many
Americans order this dish.

631
01:17:20,058 --> 01:17:21,658
They don't know what
they're missing.

632
01:17:21,660 --> 01:17:23,594
Bon appétit.

633
01:17:23,596 --> 01:17:24,897
Thank you.

634
01:17:28,534 --> 01:17:31,568
It's good to see
you enjoy your food.

635
01:17:31,570 --> 01:17:35,141
I'm enjoying everything now,
Daddy.

636
01:17:36,542 --> 01:17:39,310
So, how are you feeling?

637
01:17:39,312 --> 01:17:42,145
I mean, after the accident.

638
01:17:42,147 --> 01:17:44,247
Oh, I'm good.

639
01:17:44,249 --> 01:17:47,184
- You're good?
- Mm-hm.

640
01:17:47,186 --> 01:17:49,619
It was only a couple days ago.

641
01:17:49,621 --> 01:17:55,591
- You two were so close.
- Not anymore.

642
01:17:55,593 --> 01:18:00,997
Daddy, are you ever coming
back home?

643
01:18:00,999 --> 01:18:06,403
It's complicated. Your mom and
I, um, we have problems.

644
01:18:06,405 --> 01:18:09,305
But it's nothing
you can't fix, right?

645
01:18:09,307 --> 01:18:14,677
That's what you do best,
fix things.

646
01:18:14,679 --> 01:18:18,284
Yeah... I try.

647
01:18:26,525 --> 01:18:28,094
Honey.

648
01:18:30,228 --> 01:18:32,365
Hey, clean yourself up.

649
01:18:35,133 --> 01:18:36,468
What are you doing?

650
01:18:37,770 --> 01:18:40,272
Sit in your chair.

651
01:18:42,741 --> 01:18:45,445
Sit in your chair properly.

652
01:18:49,048 --> 01:18:50,417
Cheers.

653
01:19:00,226 --> 01:19:03,295
What do you see? Hm?

654
01:19:05,697 --> 01:19:10,266
You see a sophisticated,
young woman? Do you?

655
01:19:10,268 --> 01:19:13,403
A fiery, independent spirit?

656
01:19:13,405 --> 01:19:17,341
An adult? Is that what you see?

657
01:19:17,343 --> 01:19:19,743
'Cause I'll tell you what I see.

658
01:19:19,745 --> 01:19:26,019
I see a little girl trying way
too hard and looking pathetic.

659
01:19:28,187 --> 01:19:32,221
Now sit in your goddamn chair.

660
01:19:54,379 --> 01:19:56,680
So at the base of the well...

661
01:19:56,682 --> 01:19:59,649
Dante finds himself within
a large, frozen lake.

662
01:19:59,651 --> 01:20:03,119
It's Cocytus, the ninth circle
of hell.

663
01:20:03,121 --> 01:20:05,322
Entrapped in the ice, he finds
the sinners guilty...

664
01:20:05,324 --> 01:20:06,657
of treacheries against those...

665
01:20:06,659 --> 01:20:10,461
who with they had special
relationships.

666
01:20:10,463 --> 01:20:14,698
Now, as Ciardi writes, the
treacheries of these souls...

667
01:20:14,700 --> 01:20:18,268
were denials of love and
of all human warmth.

668
01:20:18,270 --> 01:20:20,304
As they denied human ties...

669
01:20:20,306 --> 01:20:25,641
so were they bound by the
unyielding ice.

670
01:20:25,643 --> 01:20:33,117
All right, round one, Caina,
named after?

671
01:20:33,119 --> 01:20:35,152
Not everyone at once.

672
01:20:35,154 --> 01:20:38,822
It was Cain, surprise, surprise.

673
01:20:38,824 --> 01:20:41,824
And he killed his own brother
in the first act of murder...

674
01:20:41,826 --> 01:20:44,427
that's Genesis 4:8.

675
01:20:44,429 --> 01:20:46,662
Now this roundhouse is the
kindreds...

676
01:20:46,664 --> 01:20:49,233
to their to their treacheries.

677
01:20:49,235 --> 01:20:54,203
So they're allowed to have their
heads and necks above the ice...

678
01:20:54,205 --> 01:20:57,407
and they're allowed to bow just
to prevent themselves...

679
01:21:14,927 --> 01:21:18,628
Maria! Maria! Hey, Maria!

680
01:21:18,630 --> 01:21:21,564
Maria, get back, it's freezing.

681
01:21:29,374 --> 01:21:31,578
Get back in here. Are you crazy?

682
01:21:36,714 --> 01:21:39,248
Stop it, it's cold,
it's freezing.

683
01:21:39,250 --> 01:21:41,284
Oh shit!

684
01:21:55,700 --> 01:21:57,302
Come on.

685
01:22:14,753 --> 01:22:15,885
Hi.

686
01:22:15,887 --> 01:22:18,889
School project, they let us
go early.

687
01:22:18,891 --> 01:22:22,391
Oh... hi, Sean.

688
01:22:22,393 --> 01:22:25,295
Hey, Mrs. Brennan.

689
01:22:25,297 --> 01:22:28,265
How are you holding up
these days?

690
01:22:28,267 --> 01:22:30,833
It must be so hard for you.

691
01:22:30,835 --> 01:22:35,338
Uh... it's not easy, but
we're helping each other.

692
01:22:35,340 --> 01:22:36,974
Oh.

693
01:22:36,976 --> 01:22:40,246
And how exactly are you
doing that? By cutting school?

694
01:22:48,320 --> 01:22:50,557
Go back to sleep, Mom.

695
01:23:05,303 --> 01:23:07,306
Harder.

696
01:23:10,276 --> 01:23:11,444
Harder.

697
01:23:57,722 --> 01:23:59,389
Hey, I've got an idea.

698
01:23:59,391 --> 01:24:02,326
Isn't it a little bit
early for one of your ideas?

699
01:24:02,328 --> 01:24:04,461
Let's cut school today.

700
01:24:04,463 --> 01:24:06,630
Again? I can't.

701
01:24:06,632 --> 01:24:09,533
I got a physics exam.

702
01:24:09,535 --> 01:24:12,469
Okay, what time is your exam?

703
01:24:12,471 --> 01:24:15,072
Fourth period.

704
01:24:15,074 --> 01:24:17,607
- No, no way.
- Mm-hm. Come on.

705
01:24:17,609 --> 01:24:20,446
There's so much we can
do in a couple of hours.

706
01:24:54,545 --> 01:24:56,481
Mm.

707
01:24:58,450 --> 01:25:00,917
Mom's bottomless liquor cabinet.

708
01:25:00,919 --> 01:25:03,656
You're just full of surprises,
baby.

709
01:25:13,565 --> 01:25:16,065
Hey, Mom?

710
01:25:16,067 --> 01:25:19,469
At school, where else?

711
01:25:19,471 --> 01:25:23,073
Wait. Who... who called?

712
01:25:23,075 --> 01:25:25,442
The police?

713
01:25:25,444 --> 01:25:28,412
Did she say why they
wanted to talk to me?

714
01:25:28,414 --> 01:25:32,649
No, I'm not with her.

715
01:25:32,651 --> 01:25:34,684
I don't know where she is.

716
01:25:34,686 --> 01:25:38,087
I... I didn't get a chance
to tell you about us.

717
01:25:38,089 --> 01:25:41,792
I'm sorry, I... look yeah,
it doesn't matter where I am.

718
01:25:41,794 --> 01:25:43,859
Okay, Mom? I'll get to them
right away.

719
01:25:43,861 --> 01:25:45,831
Okay. Bye.

720
01:25:50,502 --> 01:25:52,601
We gotta go.

721
01:25:52,603 --> 01:25:54,503
The police, they wanna talk
to me.

722
01:25:54,505 --> 01:25:56,473
They wanna talk to you, too.

723
01:25:56,475 --> 01:26:00,609
They found out that we've
been... anyway...

724
01:26:00,611 --> 01:26:02,612
they're waiting for us in the
principal's office, so...

725
01:26:02,614 --> 01:26:06,483
And what do you care?

726
01:26:06,485 --> 01:26:08,185
What?

727
01:26:08,187 --> 01:26:11,488
Well, you've got nothing
to tell the police.

728
01:26:11,490 --> 01:26:16,460
Yeah, but they don't know that.

729
01:26:16,462 --> 01:26:19,229
It's the police, Maria.
We... we gotta go.

730
01:26:19,231 --> 01:26:23,102
We don't wanna get into trouble.
I'm going to college next year.

731
01:26:25,904 --> 01:26:27,636
I'm not going to the police.

732
01:26:27,638 --> 01:26:28,939
What... what are you talking
about?

733
01:26:28,941 --> 01:26:31,640
We... we gotta help them out.

734
01:26:31,642 --> 01:26:34,644
Let... let's do it for Lily.

735
01:26:34,646 --> 01:26:37,083
She's dead, Sean.

736
01:26:39,084 --> 01:26:41,721
You don't still care about her,
do you?

737
01:26:45,089 --> 01:26:47,526
What does that have
to do with anything?

738
01:26:53,598 --> 01:26:55,700
Oh, Sean.

739
01:27:00,505 --> 01:27:07,446
She didn't care about you,
not like I do.

740
01:27:11,282 --> 01:27:14,620
Stay with me.

741
01:27:20,258 --> 01:27:21,625
Stay with me.

742
01:27:21,627 --> 01:27:25,228
- Wait, Maria, stop.
- Stay with me.

743
01:27:25,230 --> 01:27:26,930
Please stop.

744
01:27:26,932 --> 01:27:28,935
- Stop. Stop!
- Agh!

745
01:27:36,607 --> 01:27:38,844
Why are you avoiding the cops?

746
01:27:44,816 --> 01:27:46,953
What aren't you telling me?

747
01:29:33,691 --> 01:29:35,658
There's no point.

748
01:29:35,660 --> 01:29:37,362
No point in what?

749
01:29:39,697 --> 01:29:41,064
Can I hold our baby?

750
01:29:41,066 --> 01:29:42,431
Honey, listen to me.

751
01:29:42,433 --> 01:29:46,802
I have seen her,
it's better this way.

752
01:29:46,804 --> 01:29:51,006
We could love her. Just why
can't we just love her?

753
01:29:51,008 --> 01:29:56,746
She's deformed, Amy,
there's no point.

754
01:29:56,748 --> 01:29:59,852
No point in what?

755
01:31:13,892 --> 01:31:16,458
Maria? Hey.

756
01:31:16,460 --> 01:31:18,862
- Daddy.
- Jesus.

757
01:31:18,864 --> 01:31:20,430
I'm not feeling well.

758
01:31:20,432 --> 01:31:23,299
- What's going on?
- I think I drank too much.

759
01:31:23,301 --> 01:31:26,935
Aw, Christ, who gave you
alcohol?

760
01:31:26,937 --> 01:31:28,337
I don't remember.

761
01:31:28,339 --> 01:31:30,372
- Where were you?
- Don't remember.

762
01:31:30,374 --> 01:31:35,080
- Can you help me, Daddy?
- Yeah. Okay.

763
01:31:37,115 --> 01:31:41,786
All right, stay there.

764
01:31:56,133 --> 01:32:00,537
Okay... here, here's
a come on, come on.

765
01:32:00,539 --> 01:32:04,073
- Here, here, here, drink that.
- Daddy.

766
01:32:04,075 --> 01:32:05,542
- Drink it.
- Dad.

767
01:32:05,544 --> 01:32:09,112
Drink. All right, drink it all.

768
01:32:09,114 --> 01:32:11,314
Oh, Jesus Christ.

769
01:32:11,316 --> 01:32:14,754
Why are you always such a mess?

770
01:32:25,963 --> 01:32:28,030
Jesus.

771
01:32:28,032 --> 01:32:30,268
Maria, put your shirt on,
please.

772
01:32:33,038 --> 01:32:38,009
Maria! I'm not messing around.
I want your clothes on now!

773
01:32:40,145 --> 01:32:41,847
Put 'em on!

774
01:32:46,084 --> 01:32:49,421
What are you doing? Jesus.
Do you think this...

775
01:32:51,388 --> 01:32:53,256
You think that's sh...
shocking me?

776
01:32:53,258 --> 01:32:54,960
You think I don't see bodies
all day long?

777
01:32:57,027 --> 01:32:58,894
It's not right, you're not well.

778
01:32:58,896 --> 01:33:03,198
Maria... stop it. Whatever it
is, stop it now.

779
01:33:03,200 --> 01:33:07,871
- Do you think I'm beautiful?
- What?

780
01:33:07,873 --> 01:33:10,006
Do you think I'm beautiful?

781
01:33:10,008 --> 01:33:12,908
Of course, you are, now get
dressed.

782
01:33:12,910 --> 01:33:19,148
Just, whatever is happening, I
want you to stop it now, Maria.

783
01:33:19,150 --> 01:33:21,984
- Would you love me if I wasn't?
- What?

784
01:33:21,986 --> 01:33:25,988
Would you love me if I wasn't
beautiful?

785
01:33:25,990 --> 01:33:31,461
- If I was deformed?
- What?

786
01:33:31,463 --> 01:33:34,099
- Why would you say that?
- Would you?

787
01:33:39,070 --> 01:33:44,006
Just put that on, please,
I'm asking nicely, please.

788
01:33:44,008 --> 01:33:46,145
Put this on, okay?

789
01:33:47,978 --> 01:33:50,215
Put it on!

790
01:33:51,249 --> 01:33:54,917
Please, put it on.

791
01:33:54,919 --> 01:33:57,188
Look at me, Daddy.

792
01:34:01,092 --> 01:34:04,426
All right.

793
01:34:04,428 --> 01:34:06,065
See me.

794
01:34:19,009 --> 01:34:23,114
Yes. Yes, I would.

795
01:34:28,053 --> 01:34:30,022
Okay?

796
01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:18,003
Why couldn't you love me?

797
01:35:25,543 --> 01:35:28,513
Why couldn't you just love me?

798
01:36:01,212 --> 01:36:03,315
Maria?

799
01:36:13,458 --> 01:36:15,361
Maria?

800
01:36:21,066 --> 01:36:23,232
Maria?

801
01:37:10,781 --> 01:37:13,084
Oh, shit.
