00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:12,571
DAWN COTTRELL: Wolves.

3
00:01:12,675 --> 00:01:18,653
Most people are afraid of wolves, but they shouldn't be.

4
00:01:18,758 --> 00:01:23,102
They're the most beautiful animals, loyal.

5
00:01:23,206 --> 00:01:27,169
They mate for life, and doing anything for the survival

6
00:01:27,273 --> 00:01:30,505
of their pack, their family.

7
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:33,182
So that's what I was thinking for the winter carnival.

8
00:01:33,286 --> 00:01:37,213
Um, there'd be a big halo of ice around your throne,

9
00:01:37,318 --> 00:01:41,072
trees in the background, wolves at your feet.

10
00:01:41,176 --> 00:01:44,096
I was even thinking we can get some artificial snow falling

11
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,068
down.

12
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,274
REBECCA: No.

13
00:01:49,378 --> 00:01:50,595
No snow.

14
00:01:50,699 --> 00:01:52,506
Why not?

15
00:01:52,611 --> 00:01:54,906
Why not?

16
00:01:55,009 --> 00:02:00,466
Because I have to sit there with $100 haircut

17
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:03,594
and a $500 gown, and I--

18
00:02:03,698 --> 00:02:08,008
I don't want Styrofoam flakes falling on me.

19
00:02:10,789 --> 00:02:13,987
You're supposed to be the artistic one.

20
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:17,184
If you can't do it--

21
00:02:17,289 --> 00:02:18,574
No.

22
00:02:18,678 --> 00:02:19,583
I can do it.

23
00:02:19,687 --> 00:02:20,521
Good.

24
00:02:20,625 --> 00:02:22,084
My gown is blue.

25
00:02:22,189 --> 00:02:25,039
I'll give you a swatch and make sure everything matches.

26
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:34,110
Now there's a cry for help if I ever saw one.

27
00:02:34,214 --> 00:02:35,293
LORRAINE RAFEEDIE: Rebecca?

28
00:02:35,397 --> 00:02:36,404
I have a good idea for you. - Yeah.

29
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:38,003
What?

30
00:02:38,107 --> 00:02:40,020
When you're up there doing your little ice queen number,

31
00:02:40,124 --> 00:02:43,008
give us your best Princess Di salute.

32
00:02:43,112 --> 00:02:48,709
Bitch, don't ever diss the Princess of Wales.

34
00:02:50,203 --> 00:02:51,176

Did you see her hands?

38
00:03:06,991 --> 00:03:09,528
Can you believe that this sketch could trail

39
00:03:09,633 --> 00:03:11,510
do with dogs all around me?

40
00:03:11,614 --> 00:03:12,483
CLASSMATE 1: Well--

41
00:03:12,587 --> 00:03:14,151
Whatever.

42
00:03:14,255 --> 00:03:16,688
If I wanted canines at my feet, I would've

43
00:03:16,793 --> 00:03:17,731
made it part of my court.

44
00:03:17,836 --> 00:03:20,755

Oh Dawn?

47
00:03:29,652 --> 00:03:30,869
Dawn?

RUSSELL COTTRELL: This is great chicken, honey.

53
00:03:50,993 --> 00:03:52,139
It's very tender.

54
00:03:52,245 --> 00:03:54,121
JOYCE COTTRELL: It should be for the price I pay.

55
00:03:54,225 --> 00:03:57,597
Well, whatever it costs it's great.

56
00:03:57,702 --> 00:03:59,996
I'm on the winter carnival committee.

57
00:04:00,099 --> 00:04:01,281
JOYCE COTTRELL: You are?

58
00:04:01,386 --> 00:04:03,888
They picked me to design the whole thing.

59
00:04:03,992 --> 00:04:05,974
That's great, Dawn.

60
00:04:06,077 --> 00:04:07,851
I'm thinking about a snow princess thing.

61
00:04:07,955 --> 00:04:10,422
JOYCE COTTRELL: When we did ours we did Hans Christian

62
00:04:10,526 --> 00:04:12,473
Andersen silver skates.

63
00:04:12,577 --> 00:04:13,794
I went with Joe Burroughs.

64
00:04:13,899 --> 00:04:15,532
I was supposed to go with Bobby Campbell,

65
00:04:15,636 --> 00:04:17,791
but he was too shy to even ask me.

66
00:04:17,895 --> 00:04:22,101
Before I forget, I gotta work this weekend.

67
00:04:22,205 --> 00:04:24,464
Every weekend?

68
00:04:24,569 --> 00:04:26,549
Doesn't your boss know you have a family?

69
00:04:26,655 --> 00:04:29,052
RUSSELL COTTRELL: He knows, just not sure he cares.

70
00:04:31,763 --> 00:04:34,440
That's why I want you guys to get a good education,

71
00:04:34,544 --> 00:04:36,525
so you don't get jerked around.

72
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:39,271
ALEX COTTRELL: You have a good education

73
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:40,801
and you get jerked around.

74
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:44,415
Alex, you didn't excuse yourself.

75
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:45,353
I never do.

76
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:53,000
It's delicious.

77
00:04:53,104 --> 00:04:54,564
Thank you.

78
00:04:54,668 --> 00:04:57,031
No pie?

79
00:04:57,135 --> 00:04:58,874
I have some paperwork.

80
00:04:58,979 --> 00:05:00,229
You always have paperwork.

DAWN COTTRELL: Mh-hm.

85
00:05:14,167 --> 00:05:16,287
JOYCE COTTRELL: Did she tell you what you have to go?

86
00:05:16,391 --> 00:05:17,852
DAWN COTTRELL: Sometimes-- sometimes she

87
00:05:17,956 --> 00:05:19,867
lets us do it alone.

88
00:05:19,972 --> 00:05:23,447
You know, you've been promising to do my portrait.

89
00:05:23,551 --> 00:05:27,236
You and dad together We just got to get you both to sit

90
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:28,417
still for three hours.

91
00:05:28,521 --> 00:05:29,842
Well that shouldn't be hard for him

00:05:29,947 --> 00:05:32,762
if you put a football game on.

93
00:05:32,866 --> 00:05:37,106
Mom, I'm seeing this boy.

94
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:38,566
Really?

95
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:39,887
You have a boyfriend?

96
00:05:39,991 --> 00:05:42,320
Yes, really.

97
00:05:42,424 --> 00:05:43,537
Is that such a surprise?

98
00:05:43,641 --> 00:05:45,170
No.

99
00:05:45,274 --> 00:05:46,282
So what's the story?

100
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:47,220
What's his name?

101
00:05:47,325 --> 00:05:48,263
Craig.

102
00:05:48,368 --> 00:05:49,689
He's 19.

103
00:05:49,793 --> 00:05:51,252
JOYCE COTTRELL: How long have you been seeing him?

104
00:05:51,357 --> 00:05:52,573
Few weeks now.

105
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:59,386
Oh Dawn, I hope you'll be careful.

106
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:00,359
Mom.

107
00:06:00,463 --> 00:06:02,270
Oh, don't act so shocked.

108
00:06:02,374 --> 00:06:05,364
I know about kids today 12 and 14 years old

109
00:06:05,468 --> 00:06:06,894
and they're out there experimenting.

110
00:06:06,998 --> 00:06:09,012
That's not what I'm interested in.

111
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:10,508
Oh.

112
00:06:10,612 --> 00:06:13,949
Well it's damn sure what he's interested in.

113
00:06:14,053 --> 00:06:16,486
A 19-year-old boy is a walking erection.

114
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:18,954
He's sensitive.

115
00:06:19,057 --> 00:06:19,928
He's a musician.

116
00:06:20,031 --> 00:06:21,143
[laughter]

117
00:06:21,247 --> 00:06:25,175
A musician and he's not after sex?

118
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:28,233
[laughter]

119
00:06:28,338 --> 00:06:30,354
That's good.

120
00:06:30,459 --> 00:06:31,710
I'm sorry.

121
00:06:31,814 --> 00:06:33,796
I'm sorry, Dawn.

122
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:36,227
Sex is important.

123
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:37,654
Take your father and me.

124
00:06:37,758 --> 00:06:40,085
I mean we got married for all the right reasons.

125
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:42,658
A home, kids.

126
00:06:42,762 --> 00:06:45,647
The sex was hm, but I figured it would get better.

127
00:06:45,752 --> 00:06:47,455
And after 20 years when it doesn't and you

128
00:06:47,559 --> 00:06:49,192
make love once a month, maybe--

129
00:06:49,296 --> 00:06:50,443
Mom--

130
00:06:50,548 --> 00:06:53,398
Dawn, I'm trying to be open with you.

131
00:06:53,503 --> 00:06:56,108
Anything you want to talk about I'll listen.

132
00:06:56,213 --> 00:06:58,229
You know how it was with my mother.

133
00:06:58,334 --> 00:07:01,462
To her, communicating meant slapping my face.

134
00:07:01,566 --> 00:07:04,382
Now, I hope that's not the kind of mother you want.

135
00:07:04,486 --> 00:07:07,405
But if you get pregnant, who are you gonna turn to?

136
00:07:07,509 --> 00:07:08,657
Your father?

137
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:10,220
No, I don't think so.

138
00:07:10,324 --> 00:07:13,174
It'll be me, just like everything else around here.

142
00:07:38,373 --> 00:07:41,015
So does anybody know you're here?

143
00:07:41,119 --> 00:07:42,927
Did anybody see you coming?

144
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:43,900
No, I don't think so.

145
00:07:44,003 --> 00:07:44,874
Good.

146
00:07:47,828 --> 00:07:51,408
Just because you know people like to talk,

147
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:53,388
ruin a good thing by yapping about it.

148
00:07:53,493 --> 00:07:56,900
Me personally, I like to keep it inside, save it for my music.

149
00:07:57,003 --> 00:07:58,707
Like it's just our little secret.

150
00:07:58,811 --> 00:07:59,644
Exactly.

You're pretty.

No.

159
00:09:16,249 --> 00:09:16,910
What?

160
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:18,752
It's cold.

161
00:09:18,856 --> 00:09:20,038
I want to leave it on.

162
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:21,810
Don't worry about that I'll make you warm.

163
00:09:21,915 --> 00:09:24,069
I'm just-- I'm just--

164
00:09:24,173 --> 00:09:25,668
I'm just not ready for this.

CRAIG CROSETTO: Hey, no means no.

166
00:09:32,515 --> 00:09:33,558
Wait.

167
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:41,030
There are other things we can do.

168
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:47,252
Oh yeah?

169
00:09:51,005 --> 00:09:51,875

Um, yeah.

175
00:10:14,397 --> 00:10:16,831
Come on in.

176
00:10:16,935 --> 00:10:18,220
What's up?

177
00:10:18,325 --> 00:10:22,531
I've got this math test on logarithms.

178
00:10:22,635 --> 00:10:25,451
I can't figure these things out.

179
00:10:25,555 --> 00:10:27,118
Logarithms, huh?

180
00:10:27,222 --> 00:10:28,369
You know what?

181
00:10:28,475 --> 00:10:30,038
These things look scarier than they really are.

182
00:10:30,142 --> 00:10:33,583
Mr. Warner only puts two questions on the test.

183
00:10:33,688 --> 00:10:35,356
Miss one and you fail.

184
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:37,790
Really?

185
00:10:37,894 --> 00:10:39,074
We can't have that.

00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:43,141
I can't afford to send you.

188
00:10:43,245 --> 00:10:44,810
So let's have a look.

189
00:10:44,915 --> 00:10:45,783
Dad?

190
00:10:45,888 --> 00:10:47,069
Hm?

191
00:10:47,173 --> 00:10:52,491
When you're with a boy, what if he doesn't say much?

192
00:10:59,512 --> 00:11:02,014
Not much of a talker I guess.

193
00:11:02,118 --> 00:11:02,989
Some guys aren't.

194
00:11:03,092 --> 00:11:04,726
You don't think it means--

195
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:05,907
Look, you know what?

196
00:11:06,012 --> 00:11:09,417
Logarithms, it's just easier if you sit down

197
00:11:09,523 --> 00:11:13,589
and plow right through them.

198
00:11:13,694 --> 00:11:15,048
It's OK.

199
00:11:15,152 --> 00:11:18,107
I got it.

200
00:11:18,211 --> 00:11:19,985
Hey?

201
00:11:20,088 --> 00:11:21,270
Ace that test, make me proud.

202
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:28,395
[music playing]

203
00:11:37,432 --> 00:11:38,683
I'll help you with that.

204
00:11:38,787 --> 00:11:40,178
DAWN COTTRELL: No, It's OK.

205
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:41,220
No, I'll do it.

206
00:11:41,325 --> 00:11:42,716
Listen, you can't carry all of that.

207
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:44,487
Come on.

208
00:11:44,593 --> 00:11:46,747
You're not embarrassed to be seen with your mother, are you?

209
00:11:46,851 --> 00:11:50,466
[music playing]

210
00:11:55,158 --> 00:11:58,147
[bell ringing]

211
00:11:59,955 --> 00:12:04,612
Boy, ah, this brings back memories.

212
00:12:04,717 --> 00:12:08,261
Waiting around for classes to start,

213
00:12:08,365 --> 00:12:12,328
standing around gossiping, flirting with boys.

214
00:12:12,432 --> 00:12:15,178
Place even smells the same.

215
00:12:15,282 --> 00:12:18,828
Oh sorry, Dawn.

216
00:12:18,932 --> 00:12:21,087
Mom, I've got to get these to the art room.

217
00:12:21,191 --> 00:12:22,060
Oh, I'll take them.

218
00:12:22,164 --> 00:12:23,381
It's OK.

219
00:12:23,485 --> 00:12:24,945
Uh, uh, you go hang out with your friends.

220
00:12:25,048 --> 00:12:26,126
No, it's OK.

221
00:12:26,231 --> 00:12:27,760
You don't think I know where the art room is?

222
00:12:27,865 --> 00:12:29,706
Well, I've got this special project I'm working on.

223
00:12:29,812 --> 00:12:32,592
That's great, sweetheart, but socializing is a part of school

224
00:12:32,696 --> 00:12:33,530
too.

225
00:12:33,634 --> 00:12:35,372
I know, but--

226
00:12:35,476 --> 00:12:38,257
Dawn, go on.

227
00:12:38,361 --> 00:12:41,107
This is the fun part of school.

228
00:12:41,211 --> 00:12:42,045
I'll go with you.

229
00:12:42,149 --> 00:12:43,018
Come on.

230
00:12:43,122 --> 00:12:44,305
It's OK, I'll go.

231
00:12:44,409 --> 00:12:45,416
Good girl.

232
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:55,670
Um, excuse me, Rebecca.

233
00:12:55,774 --> 00:12:58,868
I have some new ideas for the carnival.

234
00:12:58,972 --> 00:13:02,969
Not now, I'm talking to people.

235
00:13:03,072 --> 00:13:04,185
Anyways--

236
00:13:04,289 --> 00:13:05,367
CLASSMATE 1: Yeah.

237
00:13:05,472 --> 00:13:06,897
So I was like super did not sleep.

238
00:13:11,101 --> 00:13:12,074
What are you doing?

239
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:13,013
I said later.

240
00:13:17,567 --> 00:13:18,575
Who is that?

241
00:13:18,679 --> 00:13:21,425
Your mom?

242
00:13:21,529 --> 00:13:23,093
Oh, I get it.

243
00:13:23,197 --> 00:13:26,673
You want her to think you're popular.

244
00:13:26,778 --> 00:13:29,210
All right, showtime guys.

245
00:13:29,314 --> 00:13:31,644
Hi, Mrs. Cottrell.

246
00:13:31,748 --> 00:13:33,764
We're such good friends with your daughter.

247
00:13:33,868 --> 00:13:36,092
And we just can't wait to see her every morning.

248
00:13:36,196 --> 00:13:39,463
She gives us beauty tips and fashion advice.

249
00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:42,453
We just can't wait to hear about the boy she's dating.

250
00:13:42,557 --> 00:13:46,171
[music playing]

251
00:13:51,315 --> 00:13:54,966
You owe us big time.

252
00:13:55,069 --> 00:13:59,275
This carnival better be perfect.

253
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,396
Yeah, it will.

254
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:05,010
[music playing]

255
00:14:37,647 --> 00:14:41,261
[breathing hard]

256
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:49,325
You know, this doesn't surprise me at all.

257
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,272
Lorraine.

258
00:14:51,376 --> 00:14:54,852
[breathing hard]

259
00:14:58,223 --> 00:15:00,204
All the crap you take from people

260
00:15:00,308 --> 00:15:03,367
I figured you had to be doing something to level yourself

261
00:15:03,472 --> 00:15:07,016
out, but this is extreme.

262
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:07,956
It was just a blister.

263
00:15:08,059 --> 00:15:09,276
I was trying to lance it.

264
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:12,264
Yeah, right.

265
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:16,366
I've heard about this kind of thing.

266
00:15:16,471 --> 00:15:19,599
Let me see it.

267
00:15:19,703 --> 00:15:21,545
Come on, I'm not gonna tell anybody.

268
00:15:24,777 --> 00:15:25,647
Come on.

269
00:15:25,751 --> 00:15:29,330
[music playing]

270
00:15:37,499 --> 00:15:39,062
Doesn't that hurt?

271
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:41,009
Only when I want it to.

272
00:15:41,113 --> 00:15:44,658
Ooh, freaky.

273
00:15:44,763 --> 00:15:45,910
Who knew you had it in you?

274
00:15:49,629 --> 00:15:51,471
Hey, you want to hit it before I put it out?

275
00:15:54,808 --> 00:15:56,128
You won't tell anybody?

276
00:15:56,232 --> 00:15:58,874
Who am I gonna tell in this hole?

277
00:15:58,979 --> 00:16:02,593
Nobody listens to me, and as far as I can tell

278
00:16:02,697 --> 00:16:04,540
nobody gives a damn about you.

279
00:16:07,355 --> 00:16:08,536
[bell ringing]

280
00:16:08,641 --> 00:16:09,475
[grunting in anger]

281
00:16:09,579 --> 00:16:11,143
[bell ringing]

282
00:16:11,248 --> 00:16:12,116
Come on.

283
00:16:17,956 --> 00:16:20,597
TEACHER: You have exactly one hour and 15 minutes

284
00:16:20,701 --> 00:16:24,594
to demonstrate your mathematical prowess.

285
00:16:24,699 --> 00:16:31,302
Remember, this exam is worth 50% of your final grade.

286
00:16:31,406 --> 00:16:33,596
Dawn, what's this?

287
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:37,315
[music playing]

288
00:17:04,426 --> 00:17:05,782
[bell ringing]

289
00:17:05,886 --> 00:17:09,535
[music playing]

290
00:17:16,138 --> 00:17:19,441
You're saying that she cut her own arm on purpose?

291
00:17:19,545 --> 00:17:20,762
That's crazy.

292
00:17:20,866 --> 00:17:21,909
PRINCIPAL LUCE: We've been getting reports

293
00:17:22,012 --> 00:17:23,368
on this from other schools.

294
00:17:23,473 --> 00:17:25,523
It's like the new version of anorexia.

295
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:30,494
High strung kids, troubled kids, kids with screwed up parents.

296
00:17:30,598 --> 00:17:32,301
We're not making any judgments here,

297
00:17:32,405 --> 00:17:34,247
we are just concerned about Dawn.

298
00:17:34,351 --> 00:17:36,541
We want to make sure she doesn't harm herself.

299
00:17:36,646 --> 00:17:39,635
She told the nurse it was an ice skating accident.

300
00:17:39,739 --> 00:17:41,754
Have you seen the cuts?

301
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:43,110
Take her home, look at them.

302
00:17:43,214 --> 00:17:46,412
You'll see what I mean.

303
00:17:46,517 --> 00:17:48,602
We've had our official sit down.

304
00:17:48,707 --> 00:17:51,452
The problem's in your hands now.

305
00:17:51,556 --> 00:17:53,189
Have a talk with Dawn.

306
00:17:53,294 --> 00:17:55,623
If you want us to help you arrange for a counselor,

307
00:17:55,727 --> 00:18:01,880
we will, but if this happens again on school grounds

308
00:18:01,984 --> 00:18:04,103
we'll have to take action.

309
00:18:04,207 --> 00:18:05,076
OK.

310
00:18:09,561 --> 00:18:11,750
Come on, Russell.

311
00:18:11,855 --> 00:18:12,863
Thank you.

312
00:18:18,249 --> 00:18:20,648
When she applies for college, will this be on her record?

313
00:18:26,905 --> 00:18:27,843
[door closing]

314
00:18:30,415 --> 00:18:33,613
JOYCE COTTRELL: That principal's blaming this on us.

315
00:18:33,717 --> 00:18:35,733
RUSSELL COTTRELL: Joyce, she didn't say that.

316
00:18:35,837 --> 00:18:37,017
JOYCE COTTRELL: Not in so many words,

317
00:18:37,123 --> 00:18:40,634
but you know that's what she's thinking.

318
00:18:40,738 --> 00:18:42,058
Dawn's cutting her own arm.

319
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:44,248
God knows what she thinks we're doing to her.

320
00:18:47,619 --> 00:18:50,052
She said she'd keep it confidential

321
00:18:50,156 --> 00:18:52,207
and she's not even gonna tell any of the other teachers.

322
00:18:58,985 --> 00:19:01,592
She also said there were other girls doing it.

323
00:19:01,696 --> 00:19:03,190
So it's not like she's the only one.

324
00:19:05,937 --> 00:19:08,056
OK, let's see this thing.

325
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,420
Mom, they just put the bandages on.

326
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:12,331
JOYCE COTTRELL: And you can put them right back.

327
00:19:19,456 --> 00:19:25,539
[music playing]

328
00:19:25,643 --> 00:19:26,581
Oh.

329
00:19:26,686 --> 00:19:28,076
Good lord, Dawn.

330
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:33,185
JOYCE COTTRELL: What the heck is this?

331
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:35,409
I told you, I got tangled up with another skater.

332
00:19:35,515 --> 00:19:37,218
She nicked me with her blades.

333
00:19:37,322 --> 00:19:39,686
In nice little neat rows like that?

334
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:41,562
Some scabbed over, some fresh.

335
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:43,439
Man, it's like some animal clawed her.

336
00:19:43,543 --> 00:19:44,760
Dad.

337
00:19:44,864 --> 00:19:45,977
RUSSELL COTTRELL: Yeah, Alex, why don't you

338
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,818
go on over to Frankie's, huh? - What?

339
00:19:47,922 --> 00:19:48,827
And miss all the fun?

340
00:19:48,931 --> 00:19:50,460
Alex, please.

341
00:19:56,229 --> 00:19:59,045
I don't understand, Dawn.

342
00:19:59,149 --> 00:20:00,713
What is it that would make you do something

343
00:20:00,817 --> 00:20:02,973
like that to yourself?

344
00:20:03,076 --> 00:20:04,328
I don't know.

345
00:20:04,432 --> 00:20:05,858
JOYCE COTTRELL: You don't know?

346
00:20:05,962 --> 00:20:07,282
No.

347
00:20:07,387 --> 00:20:10,375
You mutilate your own arm and you have no idea why you do it?

348
00:20:15,903 --> 00:20:18,196
You're her father, don't you have something to say?

349
00:20:24,208 --> 00:20:27,302
This is a terrible thing that you're doing to yourself, Dawn.

350
00:20:27,406 --> 00:20:30,987
Now I want you to promise us that you'll stop.

351
00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:32,759
Oh, that ought to put a halt to it.

352
00:20:38,842 --> 00:20:41,414
You know what?

353
00:20:41,518 --> 00:20:45,863
Let's you and me go out together, OK?

354
00:20:45,967 --> 00:20:48,504
This one's nice I've always thought

355
00:20:48,609 --> 00:20:50,276
you should wear more lavender.

356
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:51,459
Oh, that's pretty.

357
00:20:51,563 --> 00:20:52,710
Yeah, it's pretty.

358
00:20:52,814 --> 00:20:55,281
I just don't know if it works for me.

359
00:20:55,386 --> 00:20:58,792
Well, how about white?

360
00:20:58,896 --> 00:21:00,078
DAWN COTTRELL: Oh, it's nice.

361
00:21:03,171 --> 00:21:03,936
Oh.

362
00:21:04,039 --> 00:21:07,307
But you don't like turtlenecks.

363
00:21:07,412 --> 00:21:08,072
Oh.

364
00:21:08,176 --> 00:21:09,671
This is pretty.

365
00:21:09,776 --> 00:21:10,957
Yeah.

366
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:12,243
I might have to try this one on myself.

367
00:21:16,031 --> 00:21:16,935
Here, you try it on.

368
00:21:19,786 --> 00:21:20,619
Dawn?

369
00:21:23,504 --> 00:21:27,640
Help me understand why you're doing this to yourself.

370
00:21:27,745 --> 00:21:29,795
Is it school?

371
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:31,081
Is it that boy you're seeing?

372
00:21:31,185 --> 00:21:32,819
Your hormones jumping around?

373
00:21:32,924 --> 00:21:34,870
Yeah, maybe.

374
00:21:34,975 --> 00:21:35,809
I don't know.

375
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:41,195
Is it me?

376
00:21:41,299 --> 00:21:42,169
Something I'm doing?

377
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:45,714
Is it?

378
00:21:48,842 --> 00:21:49,989
You're saying it's me?

379
00:21:50,093 --> 00:21:53,012
No, mom, I didn't say that.

380
00:21:53,117 --> 00:21:54,786
You're blaming this on me?

381
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:56,385
DAWN COTTRELL: No.

382
00:21:56,489 --> 00:21:58,679
And what exactly is it that I've done that's so terrible.

383
00:21:58,783 --> 00:22:00,103
Nothing.

384
00:22:00,207 --> 00:22:01,667
I treat you like my best friend.

385
00:22:01,771 --> 00:22:03,684
I take you everywhere.

386
00:22:03,788 --> 00:22:05,595
You know what my mother did to me?

387
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:08,654
10 years old all the cooking and cleaning,

388
00:22:08,758 --> 00:22:10,078
taking care of my brother.

389
00:22:10,182 --> 00:22:12,408
That was my job while she laid upstairs curtains

390
00:22:12,512 --> 00:22:14,597
drawn, covers over her head.

391
00:22:14,702 --> 00:22:16,821
Mom, people are looking.

392
00:22:16,926 --> 00:22:19,567
Oh, I'm sorry.

393
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:21,514
Am I embarrassing you?

394
00:22:21,618 --> 00:22:23,217
Try being called to the principal's office

395
00:22:23,321 --> 00:22:26,796
because your daughter is sawing on her own arm.

396
00:22:26,902 --> 00:22:30,481
I've had enough craziness in my life from my own mother.

397
00:22:30,585 --> 00:22:34,269
I will not have it in my life again.

398
00:22:34,373 --> 00:22:35,207
I won't.

399
00:22:39,657 --> 00:22:40,525
This is good.

400
00:22:47,686 --> 00:22:48,972
Yeah.

401
00:22:49,075 --> 00:22:50,396
JOYCE COTTRELL: I'm telling you, this thing she's doing

402
00:22:50,501 --> 00:22:53,456
scares the hell out of me.

403
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:57,070
Maybe-- maybe she's just too sensitive.

404
00:22:57,174 --> 00:22:58,461
Don't make excuses.

405
00:22:58,565 --> 00:22:59,746
Excuses?

406
00:22:59,851 --> 00:23:01,762
This is not some teenager telling lies

407
00:23:01,866 --> 00:23:03,743
or staying out past curfew.

408
00:23:03,848 --> 00:23:06,976
She's slashing her own skin.

409
00:23:07,079 --> 00:23:09,443
What if she hits a vein?

410
00:23:09,547 --> 00:23:11,598
Maybe we should get her into therapy.

411
00:23:11,703 --> 00:23:12,850
No.

412
00:23:12,954 --> 00:23:15,491
I know her better than anybody and I could barely

413
00:23:15,595 --> 00:23:16,812
get two words out of her.

414
00:23:16,916 --> 00:23:20,252
I am not sending her off to some stranger.

415
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:21,365
RUSSELL COTTRELL: What do we even

416
00:23:21,469 --> 00:23:22,790
know about that sort of thing?

417
00:23:22,895 --> 00:23:24,946
JOYCE COTTRELL: I know our daughter.

418
00:23:25,049 --> 00:23:26,474
How long is it gonna take some shrink

419
00:23:26,579 --> 00:23:27,970
to get inside of her head?

420
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:29,498
Meanwhile, she keeps slicing.

421
00:23:29,603 --> 00:23:33,391
We don't have that kind of time.

422
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:35,546
RUSSELL COTTRELL: So what are you gonna do?

423
00:23:35,651 --> 00:23:37,528
JOYCE COTTRELL: What am I gonna do?

424
00:23:37,632 --> 00:23:39,578
She's our daughter.

425
00:23:39,682 --> 00:23:41,142
RUSSELL COTTRELL: Yeah, but you're

426
00:23:41,246 --> 00:23:42,880
the one she's closest to.

427
00:23:42,984 --> 00:23:44,687
Didn't used to be that way.

428
00:23:44,791 --> 00:23:47,433
It seems every problem we have falls right in my lap.

429
00:23:47,537 --> 00:23:52,472
I'm bringing in a paycheck Tom Naydell does the same work

430
00:23:52,577 --> 00:23:55,496
and he has enough time for Leslie and their children.

431
00:23:55,601 --> 00:23:58,625
RUSSELL COTTRELL: Well Tom Naydell is happy where he is.

432
00:23:58,729 --> 00:24:00,293
I'm trying to get ahead.

433
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:01,579
Oh.

434
00:24:01,683 --> 00:24:02,865
Which is why you spend every spare second you have

435
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:04,951
in your den playing with glass.

436
00:24:05,054 --> 00:24:06,445
- Helps me think. - Yeah.

437
00:24:06,549 --> 00:24:08,391
Well you better start thinking about how you're

438
00:24:08,495 --> 00:24:10,268
gonna help me deal with this.

439
00:24:10,372 --> 00:24:11,623
That's the point of being married,

440
00:24:11,728 --> 00:24:13,292
isn't it, so you don't have to do it all alone?

441
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:19,861
[music playing]

442
00:24:30,045 --> 00:24:31,088
What?

443
00:24:31,192 --> 00:24:32,339
Wh-- what is it with you?

444
00:24:32,443 --> 00:24:34,146
You-- you suck my lungs out and then you

445
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:35,397
won't even let me touch you.

446
00:24:35,502 --> 00:24:36,336
I'm sorry.

447
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:40,054
[music playing]

448
00:24:42,244 --> 00:24:49,092
OK, let's do it.

449
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:52,741
[music playing]

450
00:24:53,924 --> 00:24:54,757
Awesome.

451
00:24:54,861 --> 00:24:58,407
[music playing]

452
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:06,887
Wait.

453
00:25:06,992 --> 00:25:07,826
What is-- what is this?

454
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:10,780
Are you on your period?

455
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:12,553
I scraped my thigh.

456
00:25:12,657 --> 00:25:13,630
You scraped your thigh?

457
00:25:13,735 --> 00:25:16,481
[music playing]

458
00:25:16,585 --> 00:25:19,087
You want to do this or not?

459
00:25:19,191 --> 00:25:20,025
Yeah.

460
00:25:20,129 --> 00:25:21,625
Yeah, I-- I do.

461
00:25:21,729 --> 00:25:22,597
Yeah.

462
00:25:25,587 --> 00:25:29,166
[kissing sound]

463
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:32,886
[music playing]

464
00:25:43,103 --> 00:25:46,093
Thinking of jumping?

465
00:25:46,197 --> 00:25:47,240
Hey.

466
00:25:47,344 --> 00:25:48,457
You got this look on your face.

467
00:25:48,561 --> 00:25:49,500
What?

468
00:25:49,604 --> 00:25:53,218
Are you in trouble or something?

469
00:25:53,322 --> 00:25:55,721
Huh?

470
00:25:55,826 --> 00:25:57,459
Oh, no.

471
00:25:57,563 --> 00:26:01,908
I-- I was just out with this guy last night.

472
00:26:02,012 --> 00:26:02,916
A guy.

473
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:04,480
Who?

474
00:26:04,584 --> 00:26:06,008
Craig Crosetto.

475
00:26:06,113 --> 00:26:07,330
Oh.

476
00:26:07,434 --> 00:26:08,616
I remember him.

477
00:26:08,721 --> 00:26:09,972
He dropped out of school to do his music

478
00:26:10,075 --> 00:26:13,134
and thinks he's gonna be the next Lenny Kravitz.

479
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:14,420
He's pretty good.

480
00:26:14,525 --> 00:26:16,366
You oughta hear his stuff.

481
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:20,677
Anyway, you went out with this guy last night and--

482
00:26:20,781 --> 00:26:21,824
and--

483
00:26:21,928 --> 00:26:23,109
You know.

484
00:26:23,214 --> 00:26:24,082
What?

485
00:26:24,187 --> 00:26:25,299
You skipped rope, lifted weights.

486
00:26:25,404 --> 00:26:26,377
No. We--

487
00:26:26,481 --> 00:26:27,732
Ah, say it.

488
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:30,826
Come on, just say it.

489
00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:32,772
You did it.

490
00:26:32,876 --> 00:26:34,893
Yeah.

491
00:26:34,997 --> 00:26:36,943
First time?

492
00:26:37,046 --> 00:26:37,881
Uh-huh.

493
00:26:37,985 --> 00:26:40,488
So how'd it feel?

494
00:26:40,592 --> 00:26:43,825
Hurt a little, kind of bloody.

495
00:26:43,929 --> 00:26:45,528
Come on, you're used to that.

496
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:46,536
Thanks.

497
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,029
Eh, it's part of my charm.

498
00:26:48,134 --> 00:26:50,080
That's why you got this big crowd of friends

499
00:26:50,185 --> 00:26:51,297
all around you.

500
00:26:51,402 --> 00:26:53,313
Ouch.

501
00:26:53,417 --> 00:26:59,569
So now that you're a woman, you think it'll make you stop?

502
00:26:59,674 --> 00:27:03,566
Why would that make me stop?

503
00:27:03,671 --> 00:27:07,007
Hey, I got to go see my shrink.

504
00:27:07,112 --> 00:27:08,189
Walk with me.

505
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:09,370
You see a shrink?

506
00:27:09,476 --> 00:27:11,770
Uh-huh ever since my old man put that rope

507
00:27:11,874 --> 00:27:15,523
chick in the backyard, like--

508
00:27:15,627 --> 00:27:19,415
most of these psycho doctors they're just

509
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:22,300
loony tunes, like working with all these schizos

510
00:27:22,405 --> 00:27:23,517
has rubbed off on them.

511
00:27:23,622 --> 00:27:25,916
But Parella isn't like that.

512
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:27,549
I think you'd like her.

513
00:27:27,653 --> 00:27:30,434
DAWN COTTRELL: Me see a therapist?

514
00:27:30,538 --> 00:27:32,658
You don't think you're a candidate?

515
00:27:32,762 --> 00:27:34,952
My mom would have a heart attack.

516
00:27:35,055 --> 00:27:36,655
Who says she has to know?

517
00:27:36,759 --> 00:27:38,566
Dr. Parella is very discreet.

518
00:27:38,672 --> 00:27:39,645
Aren't you, doc?

519
00:27:39,749 --> 00:27:40,583
DR. PARELLA: Hi, Lorraine.

520
00:27:40,687 --> 00:27:41,800
Hi.

521
00:27:41,904 --> 00:27:44,788
This is, uh, Dawn, the girl I told you about.

522
00:27:44,893 --> 00:27:46,944
Hi, Dawn.

523
00:27:47,047 --> 00:27:48,264
You told her?

524
00:27:48,368 --> 00:27:49,585
What?

525
00:27:49,689 --> 00:27:52,191
I get bored talking about my own problems.

526
00:27:52,295 --> 00:27:53,269
It's good to meet you, Dawn.

527
00:27:53,373 --> 00:27:54,589
You coming upstairs?

528
00:27:54,695 --> 00:27:57,857
Actually since she's here I thought maybe

529
00:27:57,962 --> 00:27:59,420
she could have my session. ALL: No.

530
00:27:59,526 --> 00:28:00,637
No. No.

531
00:28:00,742 --> 00:28:02,062
That's not the way it works.

532
00:28:02,166 --> 00:28:04,078
If Dawn wants to speak to me, she's gonna have

533
00:28:04,183 --> 00:28:06,755
to give me a call on her own.

534
00:28:06,859 --> 00:28:07,868
You know that.

535
00:28:07,972 --> 00:28:08,841
Dawn?

536
00:28:08,945 --> 00:28:10,230
Dawn?

537
00:28:10,335 --> 00:28:12,663
You know Lorraine is very concerned about you.

538
00:28:12,768 --> 00:28:14,993
She thinks what you're doing is a slow version

539
00:28:15,096 --> 00:28:17,320
of killing yourself.

540
00:28:17,425 --> 00:28:19,163
She doesn't understand about cutting

541
00:28:19,267 --> 00:28:23,542
and how good it feels to be in charge of your own pain

542
00:28:23,647 --> 00:28:25,802
because the best thing would be to get rid of the pain

543
00:28:25,906 --> 00:28:28,095
altogether.

544
00:28:28,199 --> 00:28:31,745
I'll tell you what, I'll give you my card.

545
00:28:31,850 --> 00:28:36,229
If you ever feel like talking, you just give me a call, OK?

546
00:28:36,333 --> 00:28:37,688
See you upstairs.

547
00:28:37,793 --> 00:28:41,338
K. Hey?

548
00:28:41,442 --> 00:28:44,188
You're not gonna slice itself up over this, are you?

549
00:28:47,907 --> 00:28:49,958
Seeing her I thought it might help you stop.

550
00:28:50,062 --> 00:28:51,383
Who says I want to stop?

551
00:28:51,487 --> 00:28:54,858
Well, you can't just keep carving yourself up.

552
00:28:54,963 --> 00:28:58,160
All that dope you smoke, how would you feel if someone

00:41:43,961 --> 00:41:46,394
They made Jamie first team point guard?

741
00:41:46,498 --> 00:41:47,437
Didn't think he was that good.

742
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,894
Where is she?

743
00:41:52,998 --> 00:41:55,326
She was just here.

744
00:41:55,431 --> 00:41:56,091
Dawn?

745
00:41:56,195 --> 00:41:59,810
[music playing]

746
00:42:24,244 --> 00:42:25,078
Dawn?

747
00:42:25,182 --> 00:42:28,798
[music playing]

748
00:42:50,555 --> 00:42:54,065
Are you sure she didn't leave?

749
00:42:54,170 --> 00:42:56,012
I was just talking to her. She was right here.

750
00:42:56,116 --> 00:42:56,985
Is she not in her room?

751
00:42:57,089 --> 00:42:58,862
No.

752
00:42:58,967 --> 00:42:59,975
Dawn?

753
00:43:00,078 --> 00:43:00,774
Dawn?

754
00:43:00,878 --> 00:43:04,458
[music playing]

755
00:43:20,933 --> 00:43:23,992
[tea kettle whistling]

756
00:43:24,095 --> 00:43:25,242
I checked there already.

757
00:43:25,346 --> 00:43:27,432
[tea kettle whistling]

758
00:43:27,537 --> 00:43:28,614
Dawn?

759
00:43:28,718 --> 00:43:29,587
Dawn?

760
00:43:29,691 --> 00:43:33,132
[tea kettle whistling]

761
00:43:34,105 --> 00:43:37,721
[music playing]

762
00:43:43,003 --> 00:43:43,769
Dawn?

763
00:43:43,873 --> 00:43:45,993
What are you doing in there?

764
00:43:46,096 --> 00:43:47,000
Are you cutting?

765
00:43:51,902 --> 00:43:54,716
Oh God.

766
00:43:54,821 --> 00:43:58,088
Dawn, stop it.

767
00:43:58,192 --> 00:43:59,095
JOYCE COTTRELL: Oh God.

768
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:00,452
Out. Come on.

769
00:44:00,556 --> 00:44:01,390
Out.

770
00:44:05,561 --> 00:44:06,464
DAWN COTTRELL: Ow.

771
00:44:06,568 --> 00:44:07,437
DR. CHAPMAN: That hurt?

772
00:44:07,542 --> 00:44:08,724
Yes.

773
00:44:08,828 --> 00:44:09,941
Good.

774
00:44:10,044 --> 00:44:12,721
Supposed to.

775
00:44:12,825 --> 00:44:17,065
So you did this to yourself?

776
00:44:17,169 --> 00:44:19,220
The burns, those cuts in your arms and legs?

777
00:44:22,104 --> 00:44:26,589
It's OK, I need to ask for the records.

778
00:44:26,694 --> 00:44:28,535
Yes.

779
00:44:28,639 --> 00:44:31,002
The nurse will be here in a minute to bandage you up.

780
00:44:31,106 --> 00:44:33,714
I'm gonna go have a word with your parents.

781
00:44:33,819 --> 00:44:36,807
You're gonna need plastic surgery on those burns,

782
00:44:36,911 --> 00:44:39,379
otherwise the scars will be there forever.

783
00:44:39,484 --> 00:44:40,353
I don't mind.

784
00:44:51,823 --> 00:44:53,247
This is the first time I'm hearing

785
00:44:53,352 --> 00:44:55,333
about the cuts on the leg.

786
00:44:55,437 --> 00:44:56,445
What am I supposed to do?

787
00:44:56,550 --> 00:44:58,043
Examine every inch of her?

788
00:44:58,147 --> 00:45:03,535
And the burns-- why is she doing this?

789
00:45:03,639 --> 00:45:05,621
Well, there's a variety of reasons.

790
00:45:05,725 --> 00:45:08,714
In some cases it has its source in either physical abuse--

791
00:45:08,819 --> 00:45:10,660
What?

792
00:45:10,766 --> 00:45:13,858
--or sexual molestation.

793
00:45:13,963 --> 00:45:17,334
Well, don't look at me.

794
00:45:17,438 --> 00:45:20,462
I have never laid a finger on that kid.

795
00:45:20,566 --> 00:45:23,520
Not in anger or any other inappropriate way.

796
00:45:23,625 --> 00:45:25,258
I think we'll all feel better if we

797
00:45:25,363 --> 00:45:27,831
have a professional evaluation of your daughter.

798
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:29,917
You can use our staff psychiatrist or, uh,

799
00:45:30,020 --> 00:45:31,027
one of your own choosing.

800
00:45:35,581 --> 00:45:37,876
They're blaming this on us, you know?

801
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:41,490
They think we're beating you, or God knows what.

802
00:45:41,595 --> 00:45:43,889
I didn't tell them that.

803
00:45:43,993 --> 00:45:45,069
Well, you know what?

804
00:45:45,174 --> 00:45:47,573
The doctor thinks you should see a therapist.

805
00:45:47,677 --> 00:45:49,031
And you're going, young lady.

806
00:45:49,136 --> 00:45:52,821
And when you go I want you to make it clear I never

807
00:45:52,925 --> 00:45:55,497
touched you.

808
00:45:55,602 --> 00:45:57,756
DAWN COTTRELL: Dr. Parella.

809
00:45:57,860 --> 00:45:58,903
What?

810
00:45:59,006 --> 00:46:01,302
I want to see Dr. Parella.

811
00:46:01,406 --> 00:46:03,317
Who is Dr. Parella?

812
00:46:03,421 --> 00:46:04,604
I'm having some tea.

813
00:46:04,708 --> 00:46:05,820
You want some?

814
00:46:05,924 --> 00:46:06,758
Juice?

815
00:46:06,863 --> 00:46:08,357
Water?

816
00:46:08,461 --> 00:46:11,415
Everything I say is private, right?

817
00:46:11,521 --> 00:46:13,014
That's right.

818
00:46:13,118 --> 00:46:15,308
You can't even tell my parents.

819
00:46:15,413 --> 00:46:16,943
That's like a state law or something.

820
00:46:17,046 --> 00:46:19,375
Nothing you say is going to leave this room.

821
00:46:19,479 --> 00:46:21,356
Because I'm telling you right now,

822
00:46:21,460 --> 00:46:23,581
I'm not stopping, and don't think you can make me.

823
00:46:23,685 --> 00:46:24,450
Oh.

824
00:46:24,554 --> 00:46:27,369
I can't make you do anything.

825
00:46:27,474 --> 00:46:32,026
Dawn, I know how precious your cutting is to you

826
00:46:32,131 --> 00:46:35,224
and I know you need it to help you cope with whatever

827
00:46:35,329 --> 00:46:37,971
it is you're going through.

828
00:46:38,074 --> 00:46:42,141
Right now what I have to offer you is gonna take some time.

829
00:46:42,245 --> 00:46:42,941
Yeah.

830
00:46:43,044 --> 00:46:44,261
What's that?

831
00:46:44,365 --> 00:46:45,512
Words.

832
00:46:45,617 --> 00:46:47,181
Language.

833
00:46:47,285 --> 00:46:49,718
We have to teach you how to speak.

834
00:46:49,823 --> 00:46:51,282
I know how to speak.

835
00:46:51,386 --> 00:46:53,959
You know how to talk, but you don't know how to express

836
00:46:54,062 --> 00:46:55,383
what's inside of you.

837
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:58,337
You do your talking on your skin.

838
00:46:58,441 --> 00:47:01,292
Now look, these are some photos that were

839
00:47:01,397 --> 00:47:02,404
taken of you at the hospital.

840
00:47:06,296 --> 00:47:12,623
These here on your thigh, long, jagged.

841
00:47:12,727 --> 00:47:17,280
My guess is that you were really angry that day, out of control.

842
00:47:20,199 --> 00:47:24,336
Now, this on the other leg, I don't think you were that

843
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:27,012
mad, just kind of irritated.

844
00:47:27,116 --> 00:47:32,400
You didn't start a new cut, just picked away at the old one.

845
00:47:32,504 --> 00:47:33,685
Now, these--

846
00:47:33,790 --> 00:47:36,118
How'd you get to be such an expert?

847
00:47:36,222 --> 00:47:39,907
I do a lot of work with kids who have anorexia.

848
00:47:40,011 --> 00:47:41,123
I don't have that.

849
00:47:41,228 --> 00:47:43,522
No, you don't.

850
00:47:43,626 --> 00:47:46,476
But a long time ago, I noticed that a lot of them

851
00:47:46,580 --> 00:47:49,047
had scars on their bodies.

852
00:47:49,152 --> 00:47:50,438
Cuts, burns.

853
00:47:50,543 --> 00:47:51,655
They do?

854
00:47:51,759 --> 00:47:55,478
Yes, a lot of people cut themselves.

855
00:47:55,582 --> 00:48:00,449
Girls your age I'd say maybe one out of every 200.

856
00:48:00,553 --> 00:48:02,777
So you're not alone.

857
00:48:02,881 --> 00:48:05,767
Wow.

858
00:48:05,871 --> 00:48:09,137
Any of them ever do this?

859
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:15,533
When did you do that?

860
00:48:15,637 --> 00:48:18,417
I don't know, a few days ago.

861
00:48:18,522 --> 00:48:19,390
Do you remember why?

862
00:48:19,496 --> 00:48:20,781
What triggered it?

863
00:48:20,886 --> 00:48:22,345
What difference does it make?

864
00:48:22,450 --> 00:48:27,245
You know, there are a lot of blood vessels under there.

865
00:48:27,350 --> 00:48:29,157
That could cause a lot of bleeding.

866
00:48:29,262 --> 00:48:32,773
So arm, leg, breast.

867
00:48:32,877 --> 00:48:35,031
It's my body and I'll cut where I want.

868
00:48:40,488 --> 00:48:43,582
TV HOST: Just how well your best friend really knows you.

869
00:48:43,686 --> 00:48:45,806
We're up to the $200 round and we'll

870
00:48:45,911 --> 00:48:47,649
start with Claire and Eddie.

871
00:48:47,753 --> 00:48:49,873
Now, Claire, we asked Eddie--

872
00:48:49,977 --> 00:48:51,993
Alex, time for bed.

873
00:48:52,097 --> 00:48:54,078
It's only 9:30.

874
00:48:54,183 --> 00:48:57,033
JOYCE COTTRELL: And your bedtime's 9:00.

875
00:48:57,137 --> 00:48:59,501
All of a sudden because of her you guys you're acting weird.

876
00:48:59,605 --> 00:49:01,098
RUSSELL COTTRELL: Alex, don't start.

877
00:49:01,204 --> 00:49:04,158
Well, it's like this whole house is some kind of disease.

878
00:49:04,262 --> 00:49:04,958
Alex.

879
00:49:05,061 --> 00:49:06,522
Alex, I said that's enough.

880
00:49:06,626 --> 00:49:08,712
I'm tired, OK?

881
00:49:08,816 --> 00:49:10,727
I'm going to bed.

882
00:49:10,831 --> 00:49:11,909
OK, sweetheart.

883
00:49:12,013 --> 00:49:13,229
Go on up, I'll be right there.

884
00:49:17,331 --> 00:49:19,312
Goodnight, dad.

885
00:49:19,416 --> 00:49:20,528
Night, honey.

886
00:49:26,750 --> 00:49:27,584
JOYCE COTTRELL: Alex?

887
00:49:27,689 --> 00:49:31,060
[music playing]

888
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:37,664
[knocking on door]

889
00:49:37,768 --> 00:49:38,636
Hi.

890
00:49:38,742 --> 00:49:40,932
DAWN COTTRELL: Hi.

891
00:49:41,035 --> 00:49:44,093
OK, let's do this.

892
00:49:44,198 --> 00:49:47,430
It's nice.

893
00:49:47,534 --> 00:49:50,350
How was your first session with Dr. Parella?

894
00:49:50,454 --> 00:49:51,288
OK I guess.

895
00:49:54,416 --> 00:49:56,955
Did she say anything about what's going on with you?

896
00:49:57,058 --> 00:50:01,716
Mom, it was just the first session.

897
00:50:01,820 --> 00:50:04,531
Did she say how long it will take before you're cured?

898
00:50:04,635 --> 00:50:06,512
Not exactly.

899
00:50:06,617 --> 00:50:09,257
Awhile.

900
00:50:09,362 --> 00:50:11,169
This is an old one, right?

901
00:50:11,274 --> 00:50:12,908
DAWN COTTRELL: Yeah.

902
00:50:13,011 --> 00:50:17,426
This is awful.

903
00:50:17,530 --> 00:50:20,658
Well, I can't sleep.

904
00:50:20,763 --> 00:50:22,674
I can't eat.

905
00:50:22,778 --> 00:50:25,732
Look at me, I'm a mess.

906
00:50:25,837 --> 00:50:27,575
I'm sorry, mom.

907
00:50:32,441 --> 00:50:33,483
I love you, Dawn.

908
00:50:36,090 --> 00:50:38,767
Anything you want, you know you just have to ask.

909
00:50:38,871 --> 00:50:41,304
You-- you know that, right sweetheart?

910
00:50:44,118 --> 00:50:44,988
What's this?

911
00:50:50,132 --> 00:50:52,496
If you keep this up I see no choice

912
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:54,163
but to put you somewhere where they can take

913
00:50:54,267 --> 00:50:56,075
care of problems like this.

914
00:50:56,179 --> 00:50:57,048
Is that what you want?

915
00:51:03,339 --> 00:51:05,147
[door slamming shut]

916
00:51:05,251 --> 00:51:09,387
Anybody I've ever stood up to, anybody I've ever

917
00:51:09,492 --> 00:51:13,140
told what I felt, they left me.

918
00:51:13,246 --> 00:51:13,941
Yeah?

919
00:51:14,044 --> 00:51:15,714
Like who?

920
00:51:15,818 --> 00:51:18,389
Like a guy I'm seeing.

921
00:51:18,494 --> 00:51:20,371
From what you told me he wasn't there

922
00:51:20,475 --> 00:51:22,247
for you from the beginning.

923
00:51:22,352 --> 00:51:23,499
Just the sex.

924
00:51:23,603 --> 00:51:27,043
Lorraine that time she blew up at me.

925
00:51:27,148 --> 00:51:28,434
She got mad.

926
00:51:28,539 --> 00:51:30,728
She'll apologize, you'll see.

927
00:51:30,833 --> 00:51:32,710
But my mom--

928
00:51:32,814 --> 00:51:35,037
if I ever told her how I really felt--

929
00:51:38,688 --> 00:51:40,495
So what do you think?

930
00:51:40,599 --> 00:51:43,762
Is she a good mom?

931
00:51:43,867 --> 00:51:45,674
Yeah, I--

932
00:51:45,778 --> 00:51:47,655
I think so.

933
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:49,984
She tries.

934
00:51:50,087 --> 00:51:51,304
What does that mean?

935
00:51:51,408 --> 00:51:53,529
She does a lot with me.

936
00:51:53,633 --> 00:51:56,205
Takes me places, buys me things.

937
00:51:56,309 --> 00:51:59,542
But something is missing?

938
00:51:59,646 --> 00:52:01,105
Come on, what's missing?

939
00:52:03,643 --> 00:52:11,638
When she talks to me, it's not like she's talking to me.

940
00:52:11,742 --> 00:52:13,027
It's like she's talking to herself.

941
00:52:15,703 --> 00:52:17,720
I'd like her--

942
00:52:17,824 --> 00:52:22,029
I'd like her to know me, to talk to me.

943
00:52:22,133 --> 00:52:26,130
And what's it going to take for her to be able to do that,

944
00:52:26,235 --> 00:52:29,850
for her to understand who you are?

945
00:52:29,955 --> 00:52:30,858
I don't know.

946
00:52:30,962 --> 00:52:32,700
Don't hide behind that.

947
00:52:32,805 --> 00:52:33,986
You know.

948
00:52:34,089 --> 00:52:35,863
What's it gonna take?

949
00:52:35,967 --> 00:52:37,287
To tell her how I feel.

950
00:52:37,392 --> 00:52:39,269
Right.

951
00:52:39,373 --> 00:52:42,501
You have to let her inside your world.

952
00:52:42,605 --> 00:52:45,421
You have to give her that chance.

953
00:52:45,525 --> 00:52:47,019
What if it just makes it worse?

954
00:52:47,124 --> 00:52:51,712
I know, it's scary, but I have to tell you,

955
00:52:51,816 --> 00:52:54,457
where you're heading with this cutting of yours,

956
00:52:54,562 --> 00:52:59,532
holding things in and then bleeding them out,

957
00:52:59,637 --> 00:53:01,027
that's a whole lot scarier.

959
00:53:17,501 --> 00:53:20,142
Whatcha doing?

960
00:53:20,247 --> 00:53:21,708
Family photos.

961
00:53:21,812 --> 00:53:25,392
Some pictures I wanted you to see from Beaker Street.

962
00:53:25,496 --> 00:53:27,720
I've never seen these before.

963
00:53:27,824 --> 00:53:28,798
I know.

964
00:53:28,903 --> 00:53:29,980
OK.

965
00:53:30,083 --> 00:53:32,760
I know this is you, but who is this other girl?

966
00:53:32,864 --> 00:53:35,401
JOYCE COTTRELL: That was my sister.

967
00:53:35,505 --> 00:53:36,444
Your sister?

968
00:53:36,548 --> 00:53:37,661
Theresa.

969
00:53:37,765 --> 00:53:41,588
She died when she was five years old.

970
00:53:41,693 --> 00:53:42,909
What happened to her?

971
00:53:43,012 --> 00:53:45,968
We were playing on the front porch.

972
00:53:46,072 --> 00:53:50,590
My mother had put us there so she could take one of her naps.

973
00:53:50,695 --> 00:53:52,885
We started chasing each other around

974
00:53:52,989 --> 00:53:59,209
and Theresa saw something across the street and she ran.

975
00:53:59,314 --> 00:54:05,570
And I saw the car hit her and I saw how it rolled her,

976
00:54:05,675 --> 00:54:10,123
and I pulled her underneath.

977
00:54:10,228 --> 00:54:12,035
Mom.

978
00:54:12,139 --> 00:54:15,372
You know what I fear now?

979
00:54:15,476 --> 00:54:17,840
Any day you're gonna cut yourself

980
00:54:17,944 --> 00:54:25,660
in the wrong place, cut too deep, and I'll get blamed.

981
00:54:25,764 --> 00:54:28,371
I can't let that happen.

982
00:54:28,475 --> 00:54:29,344
Not again.

983
00:54:42,587 --> 00:54:45,576
I told Parella how I went off on you.

984
00:54:45,681 --> 00:54:46,514
Yeah.

985
00:54:46,618 --> 00:54:48,773
Your point?

986
00:54:48,878 --> 00:54:52,075
I freaked out, OK?

987
00:54:52,179 --> 00:54:56,316
Anyway, I remember you saying how much you like to skate,

988
00:54:56,420 --> 00:54:58,714
so I thought maybe you could teach me.

So these carnival sets you're building,

992

it's gonna take a team of engineers engineers

993
00:55:42,682 --> 00:55:43,690
to work on them.

994
00:55:43,794 --> 00:55:46,400
Shouldn't be that hard.

995
00:55:46,504 --> 00:55:47,826
You got the labor lined up?

996
00:55:47,930 --> 00:55:49,285
Not yet.

997
00:55:49,390 --> 00:55:52,274
Well, I know some guys in shop class

998
00:55:52,378 --> 00:55:54,290
that may be willing to put in the hours.

999

This guy my mom's been seeing.

1002

He just he smacks her around every now and then.

I just got caught in the crossfire.

1004

Is that why you went off on me the other night?

01:03:14,801 --> 01:03:15,878
DR. PARELLA: Never?

1106
01:03:15,982 --> 01:03:18,450
It's like he's afraid of me.

1107
01:03:18,554 --> 01:03:20,952
Well, that must feel awful.

1108
01:03:21,057 --> 01:03:22,551
Was he ever affectionate with you?

1109
01:03:22,655 --> 01:03:25,923
Did he ever hug and kiss you?

1110
01:03:26,026 --> 01:03:27,834
A little when I was a kid.

1111
01:03:27,939 --> 01:03:30,476
So you must feel like your growing up is a disaster.

1112
01:03:30,580 --> 01:03:33,847
[music playing]

1113
01:04:12,080 --> 01:04:14,304
Here's where she's cutting herself now.

1114
01:04:14,408 --> 01:04:16,807
You're her father, you need to do something.

1115
01:04:16,912 --> 01:04:17,780
She's in her room.

1116
01:04:28,589 --> 01:04:31,161
[timer blaring]

1117
01:04:38,426 --> 01:04:40,197
Dawn?

1118
01:04:40,303 --> 01:04:41,832
It's OK, dad, come in.

1119
01:04:45,725 --> 01:04:46,559
Dad?

1120
01:04:46,663 --> 01:04:50,069
[music playing]

1121
01:04:58,411 --> 01:04:59,593
Cut me.

1122
01:04:59,697 --> 01:05:01,956
What?

1123
01:05:02,060 --> 01:05:06,057
If it makes you feel better to cut something, cut me.

1124
01:05:08,699 --> 01:05:10,784
It feels like you are anyway when you do it to yourself.

1125
01:05:10,889 --> 01:05:14,120
[music playing]

1126
01:05:26,982 --> 01:05:28,302
You're not the only one in pain.

1127
01:05:37,617 --> 01:05:41,371
Your mother and I, we're--

1128
01:05:41,475 --> 01:05:42,970
well, you know that.

1129
01:05:48,009 --> 01:05:52,841
I've been holding on here for you and Alex.

1130
01:05:52,945 --> 01:05:56,559
[music playing]

1131
01:06:07,403 --> 01:06:10,914
Please stop doing this.

1132
01:06:11,018 --> 01:06:15,224
[door closing shut]

1133
01:06:15,328 --> 01:06:16,892
Come on in.

1134
01:06:16,997 --> 01:06:19,777
Hi, Mrs. Cottrell, Mr. Cottrell.

1135
01:06:19,881 --> 01:06:20,890
I'm Jean Parella.

1136
01:06:20,994 --> 01:06:22,210
Hi, Dawn.

1137
01:06:22,314 --> 01:06:24,782
Why don't you take a seat wherever you want?

1138
01:06:24,887 --> 01:06:26,381
Go on, just make yourself comfortable.

1139
01:06:26,485 --> 01:06:28,257
I'll be right there.

1140
01:06:28,361 --> 01:06:29,856
I made some tea if anybody'd like any.

1141
01:06:29,961 --> 01:06:30,621
Thank you.

1142
01:06:30,725 --> 01:06:33,192
Just help yourself.

1143
01:06:33,298 --> 01:06:36,182
I'm really glad you could both be here today.

1144
01:06:36,286 --> 01:06:38,267
I know it might feel a little uncomfortable.

1145
01:06:38,372 --> 01:06:42,126
I'm sure it does for Dawn, but I think it's gonna go a long way

1146
01:06:42,230 --> 01:06:43,934
toward helping your daughter.

1147
01:06:44,037 --> 01:06:46,297
So why don't you tell me a little bit

1148
01:06:46,401 --> 01:06:49,946
about yourselves, your home life?

1149
01:06:50,049 --> 01:06:50,955
Me?

1150
01:06:51,058 --> 01:06:51,893
My family?

1151
01:06:54,290 --> 01:06:55,125
My family?

1152
01:06:55,229 --> 01:06:58,149
Mm-hm.

1153
01:06:58,253 --> 01:06:59,887
Well, uh, it's fine.

1154
01:06:59,991 --> 01:07:03,292
We live in a beautiful home.

1155
01:07:03,397 --> 01:07:04,962
Russell has a good job.

1156
01:07:05,065 --> 01:07:07,289
Both the children do really well in school

1157
01:07:07,394 --> 01:07:11,182
and this is really throwing us off.

1158
01:07:11,286 --> 01:07:15,249
Is that the way you see things, Mr. Cottrell?

1159
01:07:15,353 --> 01:07:17,995
Well, like we don't have any problems.

1160
01:07:18,098 --> 01:07:20,462
Russell.

1161
01:07:20,567 --> 01:07:23,486
I mean there are some tensions at home.

1162
01:07:23,591 --> 01:07:25,155
Every couple has tensions.

1163
01:07:25,259 --> 01:07:27,796
That doesn't make their children go running after knives.

1164
01:07:27,901 --> 01:07:31,516
She's talking about real problems.

1165
01:07:31,620 --> 01:07:33,566
Do you think there are any real problems

1166
01:07:33,670 --> 01:07:34,574
at home, Mr. Cottrell?

1167
01:07:40,900 --> 01:07:43,854
Well I'm sure Dawn's behavior has

1168
01:07:43,959 --> 01:07:46,009
created some pressures at home.

1169
01:07:46,113 --> 01:07:48,373
It's got to be very frustrating for both of you.

1170
01:07:48,477 --> 01:07:53,064
No, frustrating is when the disposal gets jammed.

1171
01:07:53,168 --> 01:07:55,011
My daughter cutting herself every other night

1172
01:07:55,115 --> 01:07:59,912
is terrifying.

1173
01:08:00,015 --> 01:08:00,955
Yes, it is.

1174
01:08:01,058 --> 01:08:04,743
So how do we get her to stop?

1175
01:08:04,847 --> 01:08:08,357
Well, unfortunately there is no one step

1176
01:08:08,461 --> 01:08:11,207
immediate solution to this problem.

1177
01:08:11,312 --> 01:08:13,711
For starters I'd like to prescribe some medication.

1178
01:08:13,815 --> 01:08:15,866
You want to put me on pills?

1179
01:08:15,970 --> 01:08:17,151
Yes, but they're not gonna make

1180
01:08:17,255 --> 01:08:20,662
you tired or hyper or jittery.

1181
01:08:20,766 --> 01:08:23,268
They're just gonna get rid of some of that static that's been

1182
01:08:23,373 --> 01:08:24,658
playing around in your head.

1183
01:08:24,763 --> 01:08:27,057
But eventually, it will get her to quit?

1184
01:08:27,161 --> 01:08:28,795
No, not by themselves.

1185
01:08:28,899 --> 01:08:31,715
I want to make this very clear, cutting

1186
01:08:31,819 --> 01:08:36,232
is a very complicated and serious problem.

1187
01:08:36,337 --> 01:08:37,240
We have a lot of work to do.

1188
01:08:46,417 --> 01:08:48,919
Dawn, I want you to start carrying

1189
01:08:49,022 --> 01:08:50,553
this whenever you're out.

1190
01:08:50,657 --> 01:08:52,116
I want you to call me once an hour

1191
01:08:52,221 --> 01:08:53,229
and let me know where you are.

1192
01:08:53,333 --> 01:08:54,863
Mom.

1193
01:08:54,967 --> 01:08:56,810
Wherever it is you sneak off to cut,

1194
01:08:56,914 --> 01:09:00,563
you hit a vein, start bleeding, I want to know where you are.

1195
01:09:00,667 --> 01:09:02,196
It's either that or stay at home.

1196
01:09:09,913 --> 01:09:11,268
She did that to me.

1197
01:09:11,372 --> 01:09:15,056
I told her to take their phone and shove it.

1198
01:09:15,160 --> 01:09:17,977
How many friends do you have?

1199
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:18,949
What?

1200
01:09:19,053 --> 01:09:20,270
Think about it a minute.

1201
01:09:20,374 --> 01:09:22,321
How many friends have you got?

1202
01:09:22,425 --> 01:09:24,685
I don't know.

1203
01:09:24,789 --> 01:09:28,333
Frankie, Ken, guys at school, guys on the team.

1204
01:09:28,437 --> 01:09:29,585
Lots.

1205
01:09:29,689 --> 01:09:34,241
You have lots of friends, I have one.

1206
01:09:34,347 --> 01:09:36,362
Maybe if she's in a good mood.

1207
01:09:36,467 --> 01:09:37,405
So?

1208
01:09:37,509 --> 01:09:42,236
So I've got one friend, and mom and dad.

1209
01:09:42,341 --> 01:09:44,252
And if they ever split up--

1210
01:09:44,356 --> 01:09:47,659
They're mad at you, not each other.

1211
01:09:47,763 --> 01:09:50,056
You don't know what you're talking about.

1212
01:09:50,160 --> 01:09:55,652
If it gets bad enough, I've got nobody.

1213
01:09:55,757 --> 01:10:01,562
Well, the way it is now with all the crap you take,

1214
01:10:01,666 --> 01:10:02,500
you are nobody.

1215
01:10:08,617 --> 01:10:10,564
So Cottrell, what are you gonna

1216
01:10:10,668 --> 01:10:12,267
do now that you don't have your half dyke

1217
01:10:12,371 --> 01:10:13,796
bodyguard to look out for you?

1218
01:10:13,900 --> 01:10:15,603
What are you talking about?

1219
01:10:15,708 --> 01:10:18,070
Lessy Lorraine.

1220
01:10:18,175 --> 01:10:20,260
Got tough with the wrong guy.

1221
01:10:20,365 --> 01:10:22,971
Stepped between her old lady and her biker stud.

1222
01:10:23,076 --> 01:10:24,884
Greaseball beat her to a pulp.

1223
01:10:24,988 --> 01:10:28,254
She's at St. Joe's on the tubes.

1224
01:10:28,358 --> 01:10:29,923
Are you gonna cut yourself over this?

1225
01:10:30,027 --> 01:10:31,000
You gonna psych yourself up?

1226
01:10:31,104 --> 01:10:32,982
Can we watch?

1227
01:10:33,085 --> 01:10:33,955
There she goes.

1228
01:10:34,058 --> 01:10:34,893
Get the bandages.

1229
01:10:34,997 --> 01:10:38,229
[music playing]

1230
01:11:06,174 --> 01:11:07,565
- Mom? - What's wrong?

1231
01:11:07,669 --> 01:11:08,746
Why aren't you in school?

1232
01:11:08,850 --> 01:11:09,859
A friend of mine's in the hospital.

1233
01:11:09,963 --> 01:11:11,596
What friend, Lorraine?

1234
01:11:11,701 --> 01:11:12,917
She's in a coma.

1235
01:11:13,022 --> 01:11:14,447
Her mother's boyfriend beat her up.

1236
01:11:14,551 --> 01:11:15,907
Beat her up?

1237
01:11:16,010 --> 01:11:17,123
What kind of friend is this?

1238
01:11:17,227 --> 01:11:19,208
The only one I've got.

1239
01:11:19,312 --> 01:11:21,398
Please mom, take me to the hospital.

1240
01:11:21,502 --> 01:11:23,692
Seeing her is only going to upset you.

1241
01:11:23,796 --> 01:11:24,839
DAWN COTTRELL: Please mom.

1242
01:11:24,943 --> 01:11:26,299
I don't think Dr. Parella would

1243
01:11:26,403 --> 01:11:27,376
think this is a good idea.

1244
01:11:27,480 --> 01:11:28,419
Mom.

1245
01:11:28,523 --> 01:11:31,443
Mom, take me to the hospital.

1246
01:11:31,547 --> 01:11:32,903
I want to see my friend.

1247
01:11:33,006 --> 01:11:34,675
When did you start raising your voice like that?

1248
01:11:34,780 --> 01:11:35,822
I am trying--

1249
01:11:35,927 --> 01:11:39,088
I am trying to get you to hear me.

1250
01:11:39,194 --> 01:11:41,452
You don't think I hear you?

1251
01:11:41,558 --> 01:11:44,686
The past few weeks my life has been about nothing but you.

1252
01:11:44,790 --> 01:11:46,597
You're not going to that hospital.

1253
01:11:46,701 --> 01:11:48,926
In fact, you're not leaving this house.

1254
01:11:49,029 --> 01:11:51,463
You're staying with me until you calm down.

1255
01:11:51,567 --> 01:11:52,505
[slamming door shut]

[music playing]

1257
01:12:12,387 --> 01:12:13,742
Are you gonna make her stop?

1258
01:12:13,846 --> 01:12:14,715
Alex.

1259
01:12:18,539 --> 01:12:20,972
ALEX COTTRELL: Quit it, weirdo.

1260
01:12:21,075 --> 01:12:22,187
JOYCE COTTRELL: If you can't control

1261
01:12:22,292 --> 01:12:24,760
yourself go to your room.

1262
01:12:24,864 --> 01:12:26,637
RUSSELL COTTRELL: Look, if it makes

1263
01:12:26,741 --> 01:12:29,869
the kid feel better to rock, then just let her rock.

1264
01:12:29,974 --> 01:12:33,553
[music playing]

1265
01:12:40,226 --> 01:12:43,041
She was fidgeting.

1266
01:12:43,146 --> 01:12:45,231
You were gonna send her to her room for fidgeting.

1267
01:12:45,335 --> 01:12:46,692
I was just trying to get her to take

1268
01:12:46,796 --> 01:12:48,464
control over her herself.

1269
01:12:48,568 --> 01:12:49,889
Well she's not you, OK?

1270
01:12:49,994 --> 01:12:51,245
She's not you?

1271
01:12:51,349 --> 01:12:52,739
JOYCE COTTRELL: What is that supposed to mean?

1272
01:12:57,710 --> 01:13:02,158
You tighten the screws and you tighten the screws

1273
01:13:02,263 --> 01:13:04,661
and she's just getting worse.

1274
01:13:04,765 --> 01:13:07,546
You're putting this on me?

1275
01:13:07,650 --> 01:13:09,318
That night in the garage when she

1276
01:13:09,422 --> 01:13:11,926
was burning her arm, whose attention do you

1277
01:13:12,029 --> 01:13:13,316
think she was trying to get?

1278
01:13:13,420 --> 01:13:15,366
You pushed me to take a stand.

1279
01:13:15,470 --> 01:13:17,381
And when I take a stand you jump all over me.

1280
01:13:17,487 --> 01:13:21,484
Oh yeah, you really take a stand around here.

1281
01:13:21,588 --> 01:13:23,882
I don't want you contradicting me in front of the children

1282
01:13:23,986 --> 01:13:24,925

Hello, Dawn.

How are you?

1305
01:15:03,634 --> 01:15:05,963
You said I could bring a friend, so I brought two.

1306

I hope that doesn't bother you in any way.

Fine.
