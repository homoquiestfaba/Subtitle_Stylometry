1
00:00:40,339 --> 00:00:40,923
Corey!

2
00:00:41,215 --> 00:00:43,050
Corey Gorey!

3
00:00:43,342 --> 00:00:45,011
Get out here right now!

4
00:00:48,097 --> 00:00:50,433
Just don't sit there, get your skinny ass
out now!

5
00:00:50,725 --> 00:00:52,727
You heard her, get moving, donkey dick.

6
00:00:53,019 --> 00:00:54,228
Shut your mouth. Come on.

7
00:00:57,023 --> 00:00:58,023
Get moving.

8
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:00,359
Come on!

9
00:01:00,651 --> 00:01:01,777
Damn!

10
00:02:39,706 --> 00:02:40,331
Corey!

11
00:02:40,623 --> 00:02:43,167
Where the hell is my TV remote?

12
00:02:48,256 --> 00:02:49,882
Have you seen the TV remote?

13
00:02:50,174 --> 00:02:52,174
Why don't you try the third dimension,
bone head?

14
00:02:52,343 --> 00:02:54,262
Corey! — okay, just a minute.

15
00:02:54,554 --> 00:02:56,806
You know, if
you don't find that TV remote,

16
00:02:57,098 --> 00:02:58,224
mom's gonna sit on you.

17
00:02:58,516 --> 00:03:00,893
Corey, get your ass in here right
now!

18
00:03:01,185 --> 00:03:02,895
Okay, okay.

19
00:03:03,187 --> 00:03:04,606
uh!

20
00:03:04,897 --> 00:03:07,191
Have a nice trip this fall?

21
00:03:08,443 --> 00:03:10,695
We interrupt this program

22
00:03:10,987 --> 00:03:14,197
for this newsflash update, have you seen
this man?

23
00:03:14,489 --> 00:03:16,992
Charles M. Bruno, convicted mass
murderer

24
00:03:17,284 --> 00:03:19,244
has escaped from prison, he killed two...

25
00:03:19,536 --> 00:03:21,413
Well, where is it?

26
00:03:21,705 --> 00:03:23,790
I—I don't know.

27
00:03:24,082 --> 00:03:28,879
"I don't know," I don't think you know
anything,

28
00:03:29,171 --> 00:03:33,925
but I'll tell you what I know, I know my
remote is missing

29
00:03:34,217 --> 00:03:36,136
and I know I'm missing my soaps

30
00:03:36,428 --> 00:03:38,305
and I know you're in big trouble.

31
00:03:38,597 --> 00:03:40,098
Belt or the curling iron, ma.

32
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:44,353
It's just a remote, a stupid TV
remote, there.

33
00:03:45,729 --> 00:03:47,189
What did you say?

34
00:03:47,481 --> 00:03:48,982
He called it stupid, ma.

35
00:03:51,568 --> 00:03:53,945
Don't you ever talk to me like that
again.

36
00:03:54,237 --> 00:03:55,237
Get the belt.

37
00:04:01,661 --> 00:04:02,661
No.

38
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:08,750
It hurts.

39
00:04:11,045 --> 00:04:12,963
Ah!

40
00:04:13,255 --> 00:04:14,255
What, ah, ah!

41
00:04:30,773 --> 00:04:32,108
Comfy?

42
00:04:39,948 --> 00:04:42,617
Who the hell can that be?

43
00:04:45,203 --> 00:04:47,372
Probably one of them nigger
neighbors.

44
00:04:52,711 --> 00:04:53,711
Well?

45
00:04:55,213 --> 00:04:57,298
I, my mama wanted me to...

46
00:04:59,092 --> 00:04:59,676
God!

47
00:04:59,968 --> 00:05:01,302
What—what's that?

48
00:05:01,594 --> 00:05:02,594
Get.

49
00:05:02,762 --> 00:05:03,762
Get.

50
00:05:11,563 --> 00:05:13,982
Now get him down from there, he has
unpacking to do.

51
00:05:14,274 --> 00:05:16,943
What do you mean? We haven't had any
fun with him yet.

52
00:05:26,744 --> 00:05:29,163
There's your fun, go and get him down.

53
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:32,541
What do you say, Corey?

54
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,209
Thank you, stepmother.

55
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:36,003
Well?

56
00:05:36,295 --> 00:05:37,504
Thank you, stepbrother.

57
00:05:37,796 --> 00:05:40,549
Corey, you have the rest of that
truck to unpack

58
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:43,010
and don't forget that all the dishes and
pots

59
00:05:43,302 --> 00:05:45,137
have to be washed and put away

60
00:05:45,429 --> 00:05:47,181
and you'd better not break a dish

61
00:05:47,473 --> 00:05:48,833
and remember, you can't go to bed,

62
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:50,350
'til all your chores are done

63
00:05:50,642 --> 00:05:52,686
and I don't care if it takes you all night

64
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:55,898
and you'd better find my TV remote.

65
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:57,550
Shall I bake a cake or something

66
00:05:57,649 --> 00:05:59,067
to take to the new neighbors?

67
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:01,236
You'd better bake two or three,

68
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:03,280
did you see the size of that woman?

69
00:06:03,572 --> 00:06:05,364
That's not a very nice thing to say,
Harry,

70
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:07,283
I'm sure she's very nice. I— Corey,

71
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:08,969
I hope you don't think you're done.

72
00:06:08,993 --> 00:06:11,120
I'm sure she's gonna be trouble.

73
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:13,372
In fact, the whole family's gonna be
trouble.

74
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:15,208
Do you hear me?

75
00:07:22,816 --> 00:07:26,027
Why did you guys have to die?

76
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:45,629
Hey, dipshit, you in there, you
wanna play?

77
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:48,048
Ah, later.

78
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:25,418
I need a hall pass.

79
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:26,961
Have a seat, miss Freeman.

80
00:08:44,646 --> 00:08:45,646
Thanks, Larry.

81
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,612
Larry, the vice principal will see you
now.

82
00:09:09,294 --> 00:09:12,130
What the fuck are you looking at?

83
00:09:13,048 --> 00:09:13,674
I'm sorry, I didn't mean,

84
00:09:13,966 --> 00:09:15,366
I didn't mean to look at your legs.

85
00:09:15,592 --> 00:09:16,819
So what happened to your face?

86
00:09:16,843 --> 00:09:18,887
Um, I was in a car accident.

87
00:09:19,179 --> 00:09:22,474
I mean, my father was killed in a car
accident

88
00:09:22,766 --> 00:09:24,643
and my stepmother was driving

89
00:09:24,935 --> 00:09:28,522
and my stepbrother was in the car and my
brother, biff...

90
00:09:28,814 --> 00:09:30,607
Okay, spare me the gory details,

91
00:09:30,899 --> 00:09:32,859
I didn't wanna hear your life story.

92
00:09:33,151 --> 00:09:34,151
Corey Gorey.

93
00:09:35,362 --> 00:09:36,947
You're all registered, Corey,

94
00:09:37,239 --> 00:09:39,740
take this hall pass and report to room
112.

95
00:09:40,032 --> 00:09:42,827
Thanks, um, where is room 112?

96
00:09:43,119 --> 00:09:44,996
Jackie.

97
00:09:45,287 --> 00:09:48,124
Will you show this nice young man to his
homeroom?

98
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:50,876
I need a hall pass.

99
00:09:58,634 --> 00:09:59,634
Thanks.

100
00:10:03,973 --> 00:10:06,851
Cool, you like Ozzy Osbourne too.

101
00:10:08,019 --> 00:10:09,019
Yeah, so?

102
00:10:09,145 --> 00:10:11,647
You know he's playing at the
forum this week?

103
00:10:11,939 --> 00:10:13,291
No shit, everybody knows that.

104
00:10:13,315 --> 00:10:15,526
Maybe I could get us tickets.

105
00:10:15,818 --> 00:10:16,318
Yeah, maybe,

106
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:19,113
but I wouldn't be caught dead with a ninth
grader.

107
00:10:20,865 --> 00:10:23,324
112 is down the hall and up the stairs.

108
00:10:23,616 --> 00:10:25,702
Okay, thanks. Oh, by the way, what's
your name?

109
00:10:27,454 --> 00:10:28,663
What's it to you?

110
00:10:28,955 --> 00:10:30,749
So I know who to give the Ozzy tickets
to.

111
00:10:32,709 --> 00:10:35,003
Marilyn Monroe.

112
00:10:46,181 --> 00:10:50,518
Hey, I know you, you're the new kid
next door, I saw you.

113
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:52,479
Which way you going?

114
00:10:52,771 --> 00:10:54,939
Um, I'm heading to room 112.

115
00:10:55,231 --> 00:10:56,775
Oh, I'm heading that way too,

116
00:10:57,067 --> 00:11:00,195
gotta pick up my little sister, she's sick
again.

117
00:11:00,487 --> 00:11:02,072
Did your mama do that to you?

118
00:11:02,363 --> 00:11:03,363
Yeah, sorta.

119
00:11:04,282 --> 00:11:05,657
My brother gave me this,

120
00:11:05,949 --> 00:11:07,910
got me with a iron for burning his best
shirt.

121
00:11:08,202 --> 00:11:08,786
Did it hurt?

122
00:11:09,078 --> 00:11:11,497
Yeah, mama threw him out for doing it.

123
00:11:11,789 --> 00:11:13,207
This your room right here.

124
00:11:13,499 --> 00:11:16,210
Yeah, this is just it, anyway,
it was good talking to you.

125
00:11:16,502 --> 00:11:18,262
Yeah, maybe we can walk to school
together?

126
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:19,620
Yeah, we'll do that.— okay.

127
00:11:19,838 --> 00:11:21,358
Alright, take care.— okay, you too.

128

Hey, hold on, I'm not dressed.

152
00:12:56,266 --> 00:12:58,186
Hey, wait a minute, honey, this won't
take long.

Keep your clothes off.

154
00:13:00,103 --> 00:13:01,605
Hey, what's happening, buddy?

155
00:13:01,897 --> 00:13:02,937
Sabino, good seeing you.

156
00:13:03,064 --> 00:13:04,064
The usual?

157
00:13:04,107 --> 00:13:06,776
Yeah, but I need to try some first.

158
00:13:07,068 --> 00:13:08,528
Alright, step into my office.

159
00:13:13,949 --> 00:13:14,949
This is it.

160
00:13:16,869 --> 00:13:20,623
This is some killer shit, man.

161
00:13:20,915 --> 00:13:21,915
Dig it.

162
00:13:31,217 --> 00:13:33,802
Hey, just one, snorkel queen.

163
00:13:42,061 --> 00:13:43,061
Thanks, honey.

164
00:13:50,903 --> 00:13:52,821
Told you this shit was killer, man.

165
00:13:56,575 --> 00:13:57,992
So, ah, same price?

166
00:13:58,284 --> 00:13:58,785
Yeah.

167
00:13:59,077 --> 00:14:00,870
Listen, I need you to front it to me,
okay?

168
00:14:01,162 --> 00:14:02,664
You know I'm good for it.

169
00:14:02,956 --> 00:14:05,458
As usual, huh?

170
00:14:07,543 --> 00:14:11,005
Hey, five days, okay, five days.

171
00:14:11,297 --> 00:14:12,497
You know where I'll be, right?

172
00:14:12,548 --> 00:14:13,567
Okay, man, thanks, dude.

173
00:14:13,591 --> 00:14:15,760
Get the fuck outta here, man.

174
00:14:16,052 --> 00:14:17,387
Get outta here, ha ha!

175
00:14:30,858 --> 00:14:32,058
I see you out there,

176
00:14:32,151 --> 00:14:33,736
get the hell in here right now.

177
00:14:34,028 --> 00:14:35,923
Where the hell have you been?— I had to
stay after.

178
00:14:35,947 --> 00:14:37,824
School's been over for an hour.

179
00:14:38,116 --> 00:14:39,176
— ow, I'm sorry!

180
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,039
Don't you lie to me, you little
shit!

181
00:14:41,285 --> 00:14:42,285
— ow!

182
00:14:42,369 --> 00:14:43,930
When I tell you to come right
home after school,

183
00:14:43,954 --> 00:14:45,914
I don't mean an hour later, do you
understand me?

184
00:14:46,081 --> 00:14:47,291
Yes, stepmother. — well?

185
00:14:47,582 --> 00:14:49,126
I won't be late, I promise.

186
00:14:49,418 --> 00:14:50,752
Now get to your chores

187
00:14:51,044 --> 00:14:52,764
and you'd better not be late again
tomorrow.

188
00:15:04,766 --> 00:15:06,846
Hey, is this
the line for the Ozzy tickets?

189
00:15:07,102 --> 00:15:10,105
Yeah, but we're here all day, computer's

00:19:03,332 --> 00:19:04,959
Ssh, what, what are you doing here?

195
00:19:05,251 --> 00:19:06,251
Where were you today?

196
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:08,045
I was out doing some things.

197
00:19:08,337 --> 00:19:08,963
You cut school.

198
00:19:09,255 --> 00:19:10,673
I know, I had some things to do.

199
00:19:10,965 --> 00:19:12,275
I heard your mom yelling at you last
night.

200
00:19:12,299 --> 00:19:13,539
The whole neighborhood heard.

201
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:14,843
You get eek?

202
00:19:15,135 --> 00:19:17,295
No, but if I don't go back inside, I'm
gonna get eek.

203
00:19:17,346 --> 00:19:18,931
Listen, I'll talk to you tomorrow.

204
00:19:19,223 --> 00:19:20,450
Hey, you wanna walk to school together
tomorrow?

205
00:19:20,474 --> 00:19:21,993
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I promise we'll walk
to school, okay.

00:19:22,017 --> 00:19:23,060
Okay, bye.

207

You'd better be there this time.

Alright, ssh!

Corey, I hear you sneaking in
back there!

00:19:37,324 --> 00:19:39,201
Where the hell have you been all day?

211

hooky,

00:28:44,525 --> 00:28:46,125
Oh yeah, thanks a lot for the great seat

325
00:28:46,318 --> 00:28:48,028
at the Ozzy concert, that's right, man.

326
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,655
Thanks for the ticket, sucker.

327
00:28:49,947 --> 00:28:51,657
You know Jackie, she sure was hot.

328
00:28:51,949 --> 00:28:54,069
I got her so stoned and turned on by the
concert, man,

329
00:28:54,284 --> 00:28:55,804
she let me feel her all over.

330
00:28:55,953 --> 00:28:57,496
What?

331
00:28:57,787 --> 00:28:59,956
And after the concert I plowed the shit
out of her

332
00:29:00,248 --> 00:29:02,083
in a gas station toilet until she screamed.

333
00:29:02,375 --> 00:29:05,670
You know, she sure was a little slut, but I
enjoyed myself.

334
00:29:05,962 --> 00:29:08,756
The Ozzy Osbourne tickets, you piece of
shit.

335
00:29:09,841 --> 00:29:10,841
Sit back down.

336
00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:13,177
You know, I fucked you and your little
girlfriend.

337
00:29:13,469 --> 00:29:15,763
Now I'm going downstairs to get myself a

363
00:30:08,481 --> 00:30:10,275
Please, I cut my arm. — I'm really sorry!

364
00:30:10,567 --> 00:30:12,819
You little asshole, you killed me.

365
00:30:13,111 --> 00:30:14,696
He's gonna die!

366
00:30:14,988 --> 00:30:17,490
I'm gonna kill you in the head.

367
00:30:17,782 --> 00:30:19,159
I ma!

368
00:30:19,451 --> 00:30:21,995
I'm dying! You did this, you!

369
00:30:22,287 --> 00:30:24,705
Oh, biff, biff, don't die, don't
die, biff!

370
00:30:24,997 --> 00:30:27,875
Get him for me, ma.

371
00:30:28,167 --> 00:30:30,294
Ma, it's Corey's fault, ma.

372
00:30:31,462 --> 00:30:36,383


373
00:30:36,759 --> 00:30:38,552
Oh, biff, oh!

374
00:31:05,162 --> 00:31:07,622
Hello, police department.

375
00:31:07,914 --> 00:31:09,540
Hello, anyone there?

376
00:31:09,832 --> 00:31:11,751
This is the 911 police emergency number.

377
00:31:12,043 --> 00:31:13,127
If you have an emergency,

378
00:31:13,419 --> 00:31:14,688
you'll have to tell me your address,

379
00:31:14,712 --> 00:31:17,215
because our machine is broke.

380
00:31:17,507 --> 00:31:20,718
For once, I think
biff's right, she's gonna kill me.

381
00:31:29,852 --> 00:31:30,937
Okay, need time.

382
00:31:32,939 --> 00:31:34,899
Need to think, need a plan,

383
00:31:37,068 --> 00:31:38,278
have to clean up.

384
00:33:01,233 --> 00:33:02,233
Fuck it.

385
00:33:05,696 --> 00:33:06,696
Yeah.

386
00:33:13,204 --> 00:33:15,163
Hey, get outta my purse.

387
00:33:15,455 --> 00:33:16,831
Who tied me up?

388
00:33:17,123 --> 00:33:19,125
Corey, untie me right now.

389
00:33:19,417 --> 00:33:20,417
Hm!

390
00:33:34,224 --> 00:33:36,142
I've got some good news, stepmother

391
00:33:36,434 --> 00:33:39,104
and I've got some bad news.

392
00:33:39,396 --> 00:33:41,106
The good news first, okay,

393
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:44,150
you're going on a really strict diet.

394
00:33:45,985 --> 00:33:50,365
The bad news is biff won't be coming
around here anymore

395
00:33:50,657 --> 00:33:52,242
and he left me in charge.

396
00:33:53,410 --> 00:33:56,955
Don't worry, I'll make sure your lifestyle
remains the same.

397
00:33:58,372 --> 00:34:00,916
See, now you can watch all your favorite
TV shows

398
00:34:01,208 --> 00:34:02,626
and do what you do every day,

399
00:34:02,918 --> 00:34:05,963
only no food, not that you need any.

400
00:34:06,255 --> 00:34:09,508
Now look, I'm exhausted and l've had a
very long night

401
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,969
and I need to get some sleep, okay.

402
00:34:14,179 --> 00:34:15,347
Fatso.

403
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:20,436
I

404
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:29,460
God, I'm hungry.

405
00:35:31,922 --> 00:35:32,422
Are you?

406
00:35:32,714 --> 00:35:34,132
Mm—hm, mm—hm.

407
00:35:34,424 --> 00:35:35,424
Too bad.

408
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:46,852

— how did you get in here?

437
00:37:50,349 --> 00:37:52,726
The door, it was unlocked.
Where's biff?

00:37:53,018 --> 00:37:55,187
Biff, um, he's out.

439
00:37:55,479 --> 00:37:58,148
Wait, so what you're saying is he's not
here?

440
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,440
Yeah.

441
00:37:59,483 --> 00:38:00,984
Impossible, nobody stands me up.

442
00:38:01,276 --> 00:38:03,111
When's he back?— he's not coming back.

443
00:38:03,403 --> 00:38:04,071
Now listen, my mother doesn't allow
people up here.

444
00:38:04,363 --> 00:38:08,158
Would you just please go, please just go?

445
00:38:08,450 --> 00:38:09,610
I can't have anybody up here,

446
00:38:09,743 --> 00:38:11,143
if she finds out anybody's up here,

447
00:38:11,244 --> 00:38:12,430
I'm gonna be in major trouble, please go.

448
00:38:12,454 --> 00:38:14,014
I have some business to do with biff.

449
00:38:14,289 --> 00:38:17,249
Wait a minute, haven't I seen you at
school?

450
00:38:17,541 --> 00:38:19,377
You're that creepy Gorey kid, aren't you?

451
00:38:19,669 --> 00:38:20,669
I'm not creepy.

452
00:38:20,878 --> 00:38:21,897
Biff didn't tell me

453
00:38:21,921 --> 00:38:23,214
he had a creepy, little brother.

454
00:38:23,506 --> 00:38:26,175
I am not little, I am not biff's brother
anymore.

455
00:38:26,467 --> 00:38:28,260
Now look, you gotta go.

456
00:38:28,552 --> 00:38:30,352
What? Wait a minute, I'm not going
anywhere,

457
00:38:30,596 --> 00:38:32,636
until you tell me what's going on here,
where's biff

458
00:38:32,848 --> 00:38:35,101
and who's that tied up to the couch?

459
00:38:35,393 --> 00:38:37,037
Would you just please go?

460
00:38:37,061 --> 00:38:39,563
Not until I talk to biff, we have an
appointment.

461
00:38:39,855 --> 00:38:41,691
I told you he's gone, he's not coming
back.

462
00:38:41,982 --> 00:38:42,608
Will you just go?

463
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:45,569
Look, if you won't tell me what's going
on here,

464
00:38:45,861 --> 00:38:47,822
maybe fatso will.

465
00:38:48,114 --> 00:38:49,198
No. I

466
00:38:49,490 --> 00:38:50,991
stop!

467
00:38:52,201 --> 00:38:55,538
Please just stop, please don't untie her,
okay?

468
00:38:55,830 --> 00:38:58,207
First time I ever
double—crossed a governor.

469
00:38:58,498 --> 00:39:00,538
What can I do for you?— why, what's the
matter now?

470
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:02,252
Hey, what's wrong?

471
00:39:03,461 --> 00:39:06,589
No, I jumped out that
window a long time ago.

472
00:39:10,176 --> 00:39:12,846
If I tell you, you promise not to say
anything to anybody?

473
00:39:15,557 --> 00:39:16,558
Please.

474
00:39:16,850 --> 00:39:19,352
How can I promise not to tell anyone
anything,

475
00:39:19,644 --> 00:39:21,938
if I don't even know what's going on?

476
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:25,525
Now why don't you just tell me where biff
is?

477
00:39:27,652 --> 00:39:30,822
I can't, not until you promise

478
00:39:31,114 --> 00:39:32,490
and not here, she'll hear us.

479
00:39:34,117 --> 00:39:37,162
— well, let's see.

480
00:39:42,416 --> 00:39:43,416
I don't believe it.

481
00:39:45,335 --> 00:39:48,130
It was an accident, I didn't mean for it
happen.

482
00:39:48,422 --> 00:39:50,090
So is the, where's he now?

483
00:39:50,382 --> 00:39:51,467
I put him in the freezer.

484
00:39:51,759 --> 00:39:54,178
Oh, oh god, sitting next to the steaks.

485
00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:56,221
Well, I didn't want him to go
bad.

486
00:39:56,513 --> 00:39:59,224
So what are you gonna do now?

487
00:39:59,516 --> 00:40:03,061
I don't know about thinking, but I don't
know.

488
00:40:03,353 --> 00:40:05,564
You could call the cops,
you know, it was an accident.

489
00:40:05,856 --> 00:40:08,692
No, no way, I'm not
calling the cops, if I call the cops,

490
00:40:08,984 --> 00:40:11,278
they let fatso go, then I'm really dead.

491
00:40:11,570 --> 00:40:13,030
Okay, you have two choices.

492
00:40:13,322 --> 00:40:15,282
You can either call the cops or run away.

493
00:40:15,574 --> 00:40:18,035
Run away? I don't know where I
could go.

494
00:40:18,327 --> 00:40:19,953
Hawaii, Rio, The Bahamas.

495
00:40:20,245 --> 00:40:21,371
The Bahamas?

496
00:40:21,663 --> 00:40:24,082
All I've got is $33, no way I could go to
The Bahamas.

497
00:40:25,416 --> 00:40:27,376
I know, I would've left home years ago,

498
00:40:27,668 --> 00:40:29,587

the concert.

Where's his stash?

Stash?

Don't let me interrupt.

542
00:43:49,366 --> 00:43:51,410
You come back here, you come back
here right now.

543
00:43:51,702 --> 00:43:54,287
I'll take care of her.

544
00:43:54,579 --> 00:43:56,289
♪ whoa ♪

545
00:44:02,294 --> 00:44:04,547
Come on, open up, hun, it's me.

546
00:44:04,839 --> 00:44:06,173
Beat it, creep.

547
00:44:06,465 --> 00:44:09,051
Hey, we gotta talk, you know, we both
live here now.

548
00:44:11,137 --> 00:44:13,681
Not so fast, since when do you live
here?

549
00:44:13,973 --> 00:44:15,599
Since last night, cozy, huh?

550
00:44:15,891 --> 00:44:18,019
You make me wanna puke.

551
00:44:18,310 --> 00:44:20,688
Hey, you should try and be a little more
friendly, okay.

552
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:22,773
Maybe you and I could get kind of close,
huh,

553
00:44:23,065 --> 00:44:23,733
what do you think?

554
00:44:24,025 --> 00:44:26,185
I wouldn't wanna catch anything and if
you live here,

555
00:44:26,402 --> 00:44:27,403
I'm moving out.

556
00:44:29,739 --> 00:44:31,115
Give it up, bitch.

557
00:44:42,751 --> 00:44:44,002
Hi, Corey.

558
00:44:45,462 --> 00:44:46,838
This is Jackie.

559
00:44:48,548 --> 00:44:50,633
I have a little problem.

560
00:44:50,925 --> 00:44:52,844
Sure you can come over.

561
00:44:53,136 --> 00:44:55,430
You can stay as long as you wanna stay.

562
00:44:55,722 --> 00:44:58,516
Great, we can be partners.

563
00:44:58,808 --> 00:45:03,063
We'll run away together, but you have to
find that pound.

564
00:45:03,354 --> 00:45:05,690
Alright, I'll see you tomorrow

565
00:45:05,982 --> 00:45:08,109
and I promise I'll keep looking for you
know what.

566
00:45:08,401 --> 00:45:10,278
Alright, bye. I

567
00:45:10,570 --> 00:45:11,571
Yeah!

568
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:43,185
— ow!

569
00:46:41,993 --> 00:46:42,994
Oh, my god.

570
00:46:45,997 --> 00:46:47,582
Thank god. — what happened?

571
00:46:47,874 --> 00:46:50,168
I've been tied here for two days.

572
00:46:50,458 --> 00:46:54,462
Please get me something to eat, drink,
please, something.

573
00:46:55,547 --> 00:46:56,798
Sure.

574
00:46:57,090 --> 00:46:59,092
Please hurry, get me a beer, a beer,

575
00:46:59,384 --> 00:47:01,469
that's what I need is a beer.

576
00:47:02,971 --> 00:47:06,391
I think he's gone crazy, that bastard
stepson of mine.

577
00:47:06,683 --> 00:47:09,769
I'm gonna kill him, I'm gonna kill him.

578
00:47:11,980 --> 00:47:14,649
Hurry. — your refrigerator's empty.

579
00:47:14,941 --> 00:47:15,941
Huh?

580
00:47:18,361 --> 00:47:20,864
Let me try your freezer.

581
00:47:25,243 --> 00:47:27,037
The little shit tied me here

582
00:47:27,329 --> 00:47:30,999
and left me to starve, I could've died
here.

583
00:47:31,291 --> 00:47:35,002
He's really going crazy,
I really think he's going crazy.

584
00:47:35,294 --> 00:47:38,672
Oh, hurry, hurry, please, I'm so thirsty,
please.

585
00:47:38,964 --> 00:47:42,009
There could be some beer somewhere.

586
00:47:42,301 --> 00:47:46,305
Corey, Corey, is that, hey,
what's going on out there?

587
00:47:46,597 --> 00:47:48,599
Hey, tell me what's happening.

588
00:47:48,891 --> 00:47:50,493


589
00:47:50,517 --> 00:47:52,311
Oh my god.

590
00:47:53,437 --> 00:47:56,398
What are you doing?

591
00:47:56,690 --> 00:47:57,690
You,

592
00:47:57,900 --> 00:47:58,900
did you do this?

593
00:48:00,236 --> 00:48:01,236
Come here.

594
00:48:02,571 --> 00:48:04,782
Come here, you're in a heap of trouble
now.

595
00:48:05,074 --> 00:48:06,074
I said come here.

596
00:48:06,116 --> 00:48:08,160
Goddammit, what's happening?

597
00:48:08,452 --> 00:48:08,953
Help, help!

598
00:48:09,245 --> 00:48:10,663
Stop, what are you doing?

599
00:48:10,955 --> 00:48:13,207
I'm gonna get you, come here.

600
00:48:13,499 --> 00:48:16,918
get out from under there.

601
00:48:17,210 --> 00:48:20,546
Come on, get out of there, you're not
getting away from me.

602
00:48:20,838 --> 00:48:22,674
Okay, okay.

603
00:48:22,966 --> 00:48:27,637
Where did you go?

604
00:48:33,017 --> 00:48:34,017
Help.

605
00:48:35,728 --> 00:48:37,397
help.

606
00:48:37,689 --> 00:48:38,815
Stop!

607
00:48:39,107 --> 00:48:39,691
Stop!

608
00:48:39,983 --> 00:48:43,444
stop!

609
00:48:43,736 --> 00:48:44,946
I can't breathe.

610
00:48:48,783 --> 00:48:49,784
Oh! — oh, Jesus!

611
00:48:53,288 --> 00:48:54,288
Oh, shit!

612
00:48:54,872 --> 00:48:57,208
Jesus, what's the car doing?

613
00:48:58,209 --> 00:49:00,002
Oh, shit! 

614
00:49:00,294 --> 00:49:02,045
Hold on, hold on, I can't stop it!

615
00:49:20,689 --> 00:49:21,689
Corey!

616
00:49:22,566 --> 00:49:23,942
Corey, is that you?

617
00:49:25,235 --> 00:49:27,154
Corey, get back in here!

618
00:49:28,572 --> 00:49:33,493
Hey, my beer!

619
00:49:35,912 --> 00:49:39,458
Please, Corey, help me.

620
00:49:39,750 --> 00:49:42,251
I'm so thirsty and hungry.

621
00:49:42,543 --> 00:49:44,628
Please, Corey.

622
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:47,214
I'm so sorry I was mean to you really,

623
00:49:47,506 --> 00:49:49,508
I won't hurt you again, I promise.

624
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:51,344
Just one beer, please.

625
00:49:51,635 --> 00:49:54,805
I'll get rid of the
belt and the curling iron.

626
00:49:55,097 --> 00:49:58,684
I know you're out there, I know you can
hear me.

627
00:49:58,976 --> 00:49:59,976
Corey!

628
00:50:01,103 --> 00:50:04,607
Help me, I need, please, I'm hungry, I'm
thirsty,

629
00:50:04,899 --> 00:50:07,610
I want a beer.

630
00:50:10,488 --> 00:50:12,073
Corey, get me a beer.

631
00:50:15,242 --> 00:50:16,243
Please, Corey.

632
00:50:18,245 --> 00:50:21,749
I'm sorry, I'm really sorry, please, Corey.

633
00:50:25,251 --> 00:50:26,795
Please, Corey.

634
00:50:27,087 --> 00:50:30,382
Water, something to eat, anything.

635
00:50:32,133 --> 00:50:34,010
Do me a favor and shut up!

636
00:50:35,220 --> 00:50:37,013
Help!— I said shut up!

637
00:50:46,147 --> 00:50:48,149
Now I have to go clean up,

638
00:50:48,441 --> 00:50:51,152
Jackie's gonna be here in a little while.

639
00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:03,873


640
00:51:13,048 --> 00:51:17,970


641
00:51:20,222 --> 00:51:21,222
Eat shit, bitch.

642
00:51:21,348 --> 00:51:23,976
It doesn't mean anything
nowadays, hildy,

643
00:51:24,268 --> 00:51:26,270
just a few words seen over by a judge.

644
00:51:26,562 --> 00:51:28,564
We interrupt this program

645
00:51:28,856 --> 00:51:32,234
with a newsflash update, have you seen
this man?

646
00:51:32,526 --> 00:51:35,279
He's convicted mass murderer, Charles m.
Bruno

647
00:51:35,571 --> 00:51:36,655
and he was last seen

648
00:51:36,947 --> 00:51:39,450
heading towards the greater Los Angeles
area.

649
00:51:39,741 --> 00:51:43,203
Bruno was driving a late model, gray
BMW, license plate...

650
00:51:43,495 --> 00:51:47,040
Promise not to yell and I'ii let you have
this.

651
00:51:47,332 --> 00:51:48,375
Agreed?— mm—hm, mm—hm.

652
00:51:48,667 --> 00:51:50,061
Good. I— if you have any information

653
00:51:50,085 --> 00:51:52,044
on Bruno, call 911 immediately.

654
00:51:52,336 --> 00:51:54,422
He has been convicted of the brutal killing

655
00:51:54,714 --> 00:51:57,425
of 23 men, women and children and police
advise,

656
00:51:57,717 --> 00:52:00,052
that he should be considered armed and
dangerous.

657
00:52:00,344 --> 00:52:02,305
This has been a newsflash update,

658
00:52:02,597 --> 00:52:04,390
now back to our regularly scheduled
program.

659
00:52:04,682 --> 00:52:05,682
Good?

660
00:52:09,020 --> 00:52:10,104
It tastes funny.

661
00:52:10,396 --> 00:52:13,524
It's just leftovers. Wanna drink?

662
00:52:13,816 --> 00:52:15,985
No, can't I have a beer?

663
00:52:16,277 --> 00:52:17,445
Just drink.

664
00:52:17,737 --> 00:52:18,737
Fine.

665
00:52:21,449 --> 00:52:25,411
I gotta get dressed anyway, Jackie’s on
her way over.

666
00:52:25,703 --> 00:52:27,872
You'll be honest I hear?— all I know

667
00:52:28,164 --> 00:52:30,324
is instead of two weeks at Atlantic city
with my bride,

668
00:52:30,374 --> 00:52:32,043
I spent two weeks in the cold.

669
00:52:33,336 --> 00:52:35,462
You don't deny that, Mr. Warner?

670
00:52:35,754 --> 00:52:37,354
Deny it, I'm proud of it.

671
00:52:37,422 --> 00:52:38,941
We beat the whole country on that score.

672
00:52:38,965 --> 00:52:40,085
Course we did,

673
00:52:40,342 --> 00:52:43,094
that isn't what I got married for.

674
00:53:37,940 --> 00:53:40,401


675
00:53:47,575 --> 00:53:48,576
Hi.

676
00:53:48,867 --> 00:53:50,869
Hey, thanks for letting me stay here.

677
00:53:51,161 --> 00:53:52,746
Things have been really tough at home.

678
00:53:53,038 --> 00:53:54,724
You just wouldn't understand.

679
00:53:54,748 --> 00:53:56,468
I—I need to use your phone.— I don't care!

680
00:53:56,667 --> 00:53:59,378
Sure, I'll just take your stuff up.

681
00:53:59,669 --> 00:54:01,105
— we interrupt our program

682
00:54:01,129 --> 00:54:02,463

this.

In Los Angeles.

686
00:54:07,510 --> 00:54:09,363
Since Bruno's escape from
prison,

687
00:54:09,387 --> 00:54:11,806
he has killed six convenience market
employees.

Yeah, it's me.

00:54:38,374 --> 00:54:40,043
Okay, are you ready?

Hey, I know he's just
a creepy, little ninth grader.

700
00:54:51,553 --> 00:54:53,305
He has a place to himself

701
00:54:54,723 --> 00:54:57,225
and he'll do anything I say.

702
00:55:01,146 --> 00:55:03,732
And another thing, the mail didn't come
today.

703
00:55:04,608 --> 00:55:06,860
Hey, great, no bills today.

704
00:55:08,070 --> 00:55:09,237
I'm telling you, Harry,

705
00:55:09,529 --> 00:55:11,169
I saw the mail lady coming down the
block,

706
00:55:11,281 --> 00:55:13,492
but she never got past the Gorey’s.

707

Good morning.

710
00:57:08,896 --> 00:57:10,272
Hm.

711
00:57:10,564 --> 00:57:11,564
Ah.

712
00:57:13,567 --> 00:57:17,112
Ah, I don't eat breakfast in the morning.

713
00:57:17,404 --> 00:57:19,031
You got a beer or something?

714
00:57:19,323 --> 00:57:21,158
No, but I have orange juice.

715
00:57:21,450 --> 00:57:22,450
Give me a break.

716
00:57:28,415 --> 00:57:29,415
Ugh!

717
00:57:30,292 --> 00:57:32,612
I've gotta take a shower and then we
gotta find that pound.

718
00:57:32,836 --> 00:57:34,962
What about breakfast?— you eat it.

719
00:58:02,281 --> 00:58:05,368
It's not in here! I'll check outside.

720
00:58:26,596 --> 00:58:31,393

00:58:47,576 --> 00:58:50,328
You crazy or something?don't ever do
that.

723
00:58:50,620 --> 00:58:51,997
Was that miss stuck up?

724
00:58:52,289 --> 00:58:53,415
No.

725
00:58:53,707 --> 00:58:56,459
Well, I saw her moving in, is she biff's
new girlfriend?

726
00:58:57,502 --> 00:58:58,128
Kinda.

727
00:58:58,420 --> 00:59:00,539
What does your mom have to
say about that?

728
00:59:00,629 --> 00:59:01,297
Nothing.

729
00:59:01,589 --> 00:59:04,091
I guess so, I haven't heard
her yelling in days.

730
00:59:04,383 --> 00:59:04,967
Is she sick?

731
00:59:05,259 --> 00:59:07,177
No, she's been kind of tied up.

732
00:59:08,345 --> 00:59:10,014
Too drunk to know what's going on, huh?

733
00:59:10,306 --> 00:59:11,826
Yeah, you could say that. I— anyway,

734
00:59:11,891 --> 00:59:15,060
I'm going to shoot some hoops, you
wanna come along?

735
00:59:15,352 --> 00:59:18,564
No, I kind of got some important
business to take care of

736
00:59:18,856 --> 00:59:21,567
and besides, that's kids' stuff.

737
00:59:24,528 --> 00:59:26,238
Are you out here looking for the stuff

738
00:59:26,530 --> 00:59:28,324
or do I have to do all the work myself?

739
00:59:28,616 --> 00:59:29,658
I gotta go.

740
00:59:31,410 --> 00:59:32,450
You're out here flirting

741
00:59:32,703 --> 00:59:35,205
with that flat—chested,
little nigger girl,

742
00:59:35,497 --> 00:59:37,541
while I'm looking through your scuzzy
house.

743
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:39,710
Hm.

744
00:59:51,554 --> 00:59:54,390


745
01:00:03,733 --> 01:00:05,360
yeah.

746
01:00:05,652 --> 01:00:07,403
Hey, beautiful, is biff around?

747
01:00:08,363 --> 01:00:09,523
Sorry, you just missed him.

748
01:00:09,781 --> 01:00:13,701
Hey, not so fast, babe, I need to talk to
biff today.

749
01:00:13,993 --> 01:00:14,993
He owes me money.

750
01:00:16,663 --> 01:00:19,540
Well, babe, he's not here.

751
01:00:19,832 --> 01:00:20,832
Comprende?

752
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,586
Hey, bitch, I ain't some stupid beaner
wetback, alright?

753
01:00:23,878 --> 01:00:25,046
I know what's going on here.

754
01:00:25,338 --> 01:00:26,522
Now get that asshole right now

755
01:00:26,546 --> 01:00:28,966
or my hand, your face, got it?

756
01:00:29,257 --> 01:00:32,552
Corey, there's someone here who needs
to talk to you!

757
01:00:34,346 --> 01:00:36,682
You're into bondage too, tubby?

758
01:00:45,357 --> 01:00:47,609
Who are you?— you ain't biff.

759
01:00:47,901 --> 01:00:49,261
Biff, you shithead, get down here!

760
01:00:49,361 --> 01:00:50,755
Hey, calm down, biff's not here, okay.

761
01:00:50,779 --> 01:00:51,779
Now can I help you?

762
01:00:51,947 --> 01:00:53,867
Look, man, this ain't no fucking game,
alright?

763
01:00:54,157 --> 01:00:55,742
Now give me my 125 and I'm gone, man.

764
01:00:56,034 --> 01:00:57,674
I don't know what you're talking about.

765
01:00:57,744 --> 01:00:59,413
Look, biff's not here

766
01:00:59,705 --> 01:01:00,825
and we don't have any money.

767
01:01:00,872 --> 01:01:02,517
Yeah, well, what the hell's going on
here?

768
01:01:02,541 --> 01:01:05,127
Why's the porker tied up and where's biff?

769
01:01:05,419 --> 01:01:08,380
I fronted him an eight ball and now I want
my cash.

770
01:01:08,671 --> 01:01:09,671
You hear that?

771
01:01:10,965 --> 01:01:14,719
I'll tell you what, you
tell biff I'll be back Saturday

772
01:01:15,011 --> 01:01:18,514
and if he doesn't have my cash, you're all
history.

773
01:01:18,806 --> 01:01:23,602
That's all, scarface and especially you,
babe.

774
01:01:24,186 --> 01:01:27,314
You hear that, biff, Saturday night!

775
01:01:27,606 --> 01:01:29,567
And if no one's here, I'll burn the place

776
01:01:29,859 --> 01:01:31,986
to the fucking ground, man, you got that?

777
01:01:40,202 --> 01:01:42,455
What are we gonna do now?

778
01:01:42,747 --> 01:01:46,208
I don't know, but biff told me he had a
pound of cocaine,

779
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:48,252
not just a measly eight ball.

780
01:01:48,544 --> 01:01:51,671
That lying, little prick, if he
wasn't dead, I'd just, uh!

781
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:00,055
Damn.

782
01:02:02,390 --> 01:02:04,893

783
01:02:05,185 --> 01:02:08,688

785
01:02:10,857 --> 01:02:12,525

♪ can't you see ♪

787
01:02:13,860 --> 01:02:15,403

788

Suit yourself.

789
01:02:17,322 --> 01:02:21,409
How are we gonna get $120,we don't
even have jobs.

790
01:02:21,701 --> 01:02:24,162
We don't have a pound of coke either.

791
01:02:24,454 --> 01:02:27,373
Should've guessed that biff was a lying
sack of shit.

792
01:02:27,665 --> 01:02:29,667
What are we gonna do?

793
01:02:30,877 --> 01:02:33,755
Well, I don't wanna go home.

794
01:02:34,963 --> 01:02:38,050
There's gotta be a way to raise some
cash.

795
01:02:38,342 --> 01:02:40,677
We could have a yard sale.

796
01:02:40,969 --> 01:02:44,515
No, where did your mom get all this junk,
the goodwill?

797
01:02:44,807 --> 01:02:46,683
No, she just wore it all out.

798
01:02:46,975 --> 01:02:48,727
Hey, maybe we could get a paper route?

799
01:02:49,686 --> 01:02:51,188
No way, too slow.

800
01:02:53,899 --> 01:02:56,318
What we need is quick money.

801
01:02:56,610 --> 01:02:58,278
I went to this frat party last summer,

802
01:02:58,570 --> 01:03:00,322
they charged admission, it was BYOB.

803
01:03:00,614 --> 01:03:01,323
By what?

804
01:03:01,615 --> 01:03:02,616
Bring your own bottle.

805
01:03:02,908 --> 01:03:06,662
If we charged just five bucks a head,

806
01:03:06,954 --> 01:03:09,665
100 people came, that would be $500.

807
01:03:09,957 --> 01:03:11,542
No way, if we have a party,

808
01:03:11,834 --> 01:03:13,994
my stepmother would be untied and then
I'm really dead.

809
01:03:14,211 --> 01:03:16,755
Well then, you think of
something better.

810
01:03:18,339 --> 01:03:20,675
We can really make $500?

811
01:03:21,843 --> 01:03:23,636
Easy and probably a lot more,

812
01:03:23,928 --> 01:03:26,097
enough to pay off that Sabino creep

813
01:03:26,389 --> 01:03:29,225
and have a few 100 dollars left to run
away on.

814
01:03:29,517 --> 01:03:31,269
Yeah, but what of my stepmother?

815
01:03:31,561 --> 01:03:34,730
Get real, Corey, none of my friends are
gonna let her go.

816
01:03:35,022 --> 01:03:37,817
We'll tell them she's on
a diet, they'll think it's cool

817
01:03:39,152 --> 01:03:41,779
or we tied her up, so we could have the
party.

818
01:03:42,071 --> 01:03:44,532
No one's gonna wanna ruin the party by
letting her go.

819
01:03:44,824 --> 01:03:47,869
You sure they won't untie her?

820
01:03:48,161 --> 01:03:51,664
Trust me, what other choices do you
have?

821
01:03:53,624 --> 01:03:54,333
$500.

822
01:03:54,625 --> 01:03:56,377
♪ what you're doing to me ♪

823
01:03:58,171 --> 01:04:00,881
♪ oh, what you're doing ♪

824
01:04:32,037 --> 01:04:33,788
What are you doing?

825
01:04:34,080 --> 01:04:35,207
Hi.

826
01:04:35,498 --> 01:04:36,750
Corey, I can't do this.

827
01:04:37,042 --> 01:04:38,585
Why not, don't you like me?

828
01:04:38,877 --> 01:04:40,438
Yes, it's just, I can't do this.

829
01:04:40,462 --> 01:04:40,962
Why not?

830
01:04:41,254 --> 01:04:44,673
Because I want my first time to
be special.

831
01:04:44,965 --> 01:04:46,842
But what about biff?

832
01:04:47,134 --> 01:04:48,552
What about biff?

833
01:04:50,012 --> 01:04:52,556
He told me you and him after the
concert.

834
01:04:54,850 --> 01:04:57,811
He told me he had a pound of coke.

835
01:04:58,103 --> 01:04:59,230
So you and him never?

836
01:04:59,521 --> 01:05:00,521
I never ever.

837
01:05:00,773 --> 01:05:03,150
Then you're a, I'm sorry, I didn't know.

838
01:05:03,442 --> 01:05:05,861
That's okay, I just want my first time to
be special,

839
01:05:06,153 --> 01:05:07,196
you know what I mean?

840
01:05:07,488 --> 01:05:08,656
Yeah, me too.

841
01:05:08,948 --> 01:05:10,324
Do you think you can wait?

842
01:05:10,616 --> 01:05:11,200
Yeah.

843
01:05:11,492 --> 01:05:13,827
We'll take the money and we'll run away.

844
01:05:14,119 --> 01:05:17,623
We'll go somewhere romantic like a hotel
room,

845
01:05:17,915 --> 01:05:19,458
just you and me, okay.

846
01:05:19,750 --> 01:05:20,750
Okay.

847
01:05:21,001 --> 01:05:22,544
Goodnight, Corey.

848
01:05:23,796 --> 01:05:25,297
Goodnight, Jackie.

849
01:05:29,801 --> 01:05:30,801
God, I love her.

850
01:06:09,965 --> 01:06:14,553
I

851
01:06:54,133 --> 01:06:56,010
Did you just hear somebody knocking?

852
01:06:56,302 --> 01:06:57,302
Hm—hm.

853
01:06:58,596 --> 01:07:00,097
I must be hearing things.

854
01:07:03,225 --> 01:07:04,225
Stop!

855
01:07:04,935 --> 01:07:06,312
Corey, hi.

856
01:07:06,604 --> 01:07:07,604
Don't!

857
01:07:07,730 --> 01:07:09,330
Why is there a padlock on the freezer?

858
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:10,941
W—what are you doing here?

859
01:07:11,233 --> 01:07:12,233
I came about the party.

860
01:07:12,276 --> 01:07:14,236
Party, how'd you know about the party?

861
01:07:14,528 --> 01:07:16,238
These, they're all over town.

862
01:07:18,824 --> 01:07:19,325
Jesus!

863
01:07:19,617 --> 01:07:20,617
Can I come?

864
01:07:20,659 --> 01:07:21,827
No, you can't come.

865
01:07:22,119 --> 01:07:23,329
What's the matter with you?

866
01:07:23,621 --> 01:07:25,414
You, get outta here before I kill you.

867
01:07:25,706 --> 01:07:26,706
Hey, that hurts.

868
01:07:26,957 --> 01:07:28,435
I said get outta here, get out of here

869
01:07:28,459 --> 01:07:30,270
and never come back, alright, never come
back!

870
01:07:30,294 --> 01:07:33,339
I don't need some stupid, skinny, little
nigger as a friend.

871
01:07:33,631 --> 01:07:35,590
I said get out of here! — I thought you
liked me?

872
01:07:35,757 --> 01:07:38,802
Get out of here, get out of here and
never come back!

873
01:07:39,094 --> 01:07:41,388
Stupid, little nigger! 

874
01:07:41,679 --> 01:07:42,679
Fuck!

875
01:08:15,213 --> 01:08:15,755
Hello.

876
01:08:16,047 --> 01:08:17,732

Continues his killing spree
in Los Angeles.

880
01:08:24,138 --> 01:08:26,432
Another convenience store was hit this
morning.

881
01:08:26,723 --> 01:08:29,309
employee and two customers,

882
01:08:29,601 --> 01:08:31,895
all were immigrants from Sri Lanka.

883

♪ hell, I can't stop,
I'm not the first male ♪

884
01:08:37,317 --> 01:08:38,819
what are these?

885
01:08:39,111 --> 01:08:41,271
Yeah, they're bitching, me and Marcy
handed them out.

886
01:08:41,363 --> 01:08:43,174
You can put some of them up. — you put
them out?

887
01:08:43,198 --> 01:08:44,491
These things are all over town.

888
01:08:44,783 --> 01:08:46,952
Hey, it pays to advertise, we'll make a
fortune.

889
01:08:47,244 --> 01:08:48,430
But you told me all your friends would
come,

890
01:08:48,454 --> 01:08:49,454
not the whole damn town.

891
01:08:49,705 --> 01:08:51,415
What if the police see these things?

892
01:08:51,707 --> 01:08:53,547
Don't worry about it, sweetie, it'll be
cool.

893
01:08:56,170 --> 01:08:57,921
But Jackie.— drop it.

894
01:08:58,213 --> 01:09:00,090
What are we having for dinner?

895
01:09:00,382 --> 01:09:02,341
Dinner, how can you think about dinner?

896
01:09:02,633 --> 01:09:05,033
I mean, my life is ruined here, the police

How about this?

956
01:12:08,565 --> 01:12:10,275
Not here, someone will see us.

957
01:12:10,567 --> 01:12:11,026
So?

958
01:12:11,318 --> 01:12:13,153
So you'll have to wait until tomorrow.

959
01:12:14,446 --> 01:12:15,446
Another customer.

960
01:12:17,032 --> 01:12:19,159
You keep it quiet
or I'm calling the cops.

961
01:12:20,452 --> 01:12:23,038


962
01:12:24,498 --> 01:12:25,624
Who was that asshole?

963
01:12:25,916 --> 01:12:26,916
That was my neighbor.

964
01:12:26,958 --> 01:12:29,086
Everybody, shut the music down, please.

965
01:12:29,378 --> 01:12:31,171
Hey, I like that fucking song, man

966
01:12:31,463 --> 01:12:32,783
and where's my cash, fucker, huh?

967
01:12:32,964 --> 01:12:35,716
We'll collect it, I promise,
we'll collect it right now.

968
01:12:36,008 --> 01:12:38,219
Yeah, fucking pronto, man.

969
01:12:38,511 --> 01:12:43,307


970
01:13:01,492 --> 01:13:03,452
You think we should let her go?

971
01:13:03,744 --> 01:13:05,204
Sign says we shouldn't.

972
01:13:05,496 --> 01:13:06,163
She looks so miserable though,

973
01:13:06,455 --> 01:13:08,175
maybe we could do something to cheer
her up.

974
01:13:08,249 --> 01:13:09,709
How?— I don't know,

975
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,253
a new makeover always cheers me up.

976
01:13:12,545 --> 01:13:14,213
Yeah, she does look a little bit drab.

977
01:13:14,505 --> 01:13:16,298
Yeah, let's do it.

978
01:13:16,590 --> 01:13:18,216
Get out my makeup.— okay.

979
01:13:20,510 --> 01:13:22,053
You do her nails. — yeah.

980
01:13:23,179 --> 01:13:25,849
Yeah, and I've got these fake
eyelashes here too.

981
01:13:26,141 --> 01:13:28,143
Ooh, what a job this is gonna be, look at
her.

982
01:13:28,435 --> 01:13:30,520
What is that on her chin?— ooh, it's a
big mole.

983
01:13:30,812 --> 01:13:32,814
Do you have that cover up stuff?

984
01:13:33,106 --> 01:13:35,275
Yeah, get that out. — yeah.

985
01:13:35,567 --> 01:13:37,087
Oh, I've got these hot pink eyelashes,

986
01:13:37,235 --> 01:13:38,361
they're gonna be so perfect.

987
01:13:38,653 --> 01:13:39,946
This is gonna be a big job,

988
01:13:40,238 --> 01:13:41,906
but this is gonna be so much fun.

989
01:13:45,577 --> 01:13:46,577
I've had it.

990
01:13:50,540 --> 01:13:51,541
Hello, police?

991
01:13:53,793 --> 01:13:57,338
There, what do you think?

992
01:13:57,630 --> 01:13:58,630
I know, watch.

993
01:13:59,424 --> 01:14:02,301
Oh, yeah, that's perfect.

994
01:14:03,594 --> 01:14:07,431
Yeah, it matches the eyes.

995
01:14:07,723 --> 01:14:08,932
I think she likes it.

996
01:14:15,647 --> 01:14:20,444


997
01:14:31,663 --> 01:14:33,248
Hey dude, what are you doing?

998
01:14:33,540 --> 01:14:35,250
What the fuck do you want, asshole?

999
01:14:35,542 --> 01:14:36,542
Hey!

1000
01:14:40,506 --> 01:14:43,175
It looks like you have a nice party going
on here.

1001
01:14:43,467 --> 01:14:44,906
We're gonna have to break this up,

1002
01:14:45,134 --> 01:14:46,427
the neighbors are complaining.

1003
01:14:46,719 --> 01:14:49,472
You all have 15 minutes to vacate these
premises!

1004
01:14:49,764 --> 01:14:51,307
This party is over, 15 minutes,

1005
01:14:51,599 --> 01:14:54,268
then we're going to arrest everyone who
is still here

1006
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:57,230
and we're gonna confiscate all the drugs.

1007
01:14:57,522 --> 01:15:00,358
You all have a nice party now, you hear?

1008
01:15:01,609 --> 01:15:05,238
Hey, wait a minute, hold on, stop, stop!

1009
01:15:05,530 --> 01:15:07,448
Jackie, Jackie!

1010
01:15:07,740 --> 01:15:09,450
Jackie, get here now, everybody's leaving!

1011
01:15:09,742 --> 01:15:10,902
They're taking all the stuff!

1012
01:15:10,993 --> 01:15:12,328
Hey, quit pushing me, man!

1013
01:15:12,620 --> 01:15:13,913
Jackie, get down here!

1014
01:15:14,205 --> 01:15:15,915
Hey, stop that, man, leave it alone!

1015
01:15:16,207 --> 01:15:17,309


1016
01:15:17,333 --> 01:15:19,126
Hey, what are you doing?

1017
01:15:21,087 --> 01:15:23,756
Stop, stop! 

1018
01:15:24,048 --> 01:15:26,384
Jackie! Hey, wait a minute, what are you
doing?

1019
01:15:26,675 --> 01:15:28,260
Hey, no, Jackie!

1020
01:15:28,552 --> 01:15:30,220
Where are you going?— with him.

1021
01:15:30,512 --> 01:15:31,805
But you're my date tonight.

1022
01:15:32,097 --> 01:15:33,431
Oh, Corey, get back to reality.

1023
01:15:33,723 --> 01:15:35,603
What makes you think you stand a chance
with me?

1024
01:15:35,642 --> 01:15:36,977
You wimpy, goddamn freshman.

1025
01:15:37,269 --> 01:15:39,437
But what about the money?

1026
01:15:39,729 --> 01:15:41,189
What about the money?

1027
01:15:42,524 --> 01:15:44,609
Jackie, come back, you promised, now get
back here!

1028
01:15:44,901 --> 01:15:47,237
What about the money? Come back here!

1029
01:15:47,529 --> 01:15:49,197
How do I get the money?

1030
01:15:53,076 --> 01:15:53,702
Geez!

1031
01:15:53,994 --> 01:15:56,288
What about the money?

1032
01:16:00,125 --> 01:16:01,125
God!

1033
01:16:04,963 --> 01:16:08,425
What am I gonna do now? She's gone off
with some other guy.

1034
01:16:11,510 --> 01:16:14,388
We were gonna spend the rest of our lives
together

1035
01:16:14,680 --> 01:16:17,516
and now she's gone off, she's gone off
with some other guy.

1036
01:16:17,808 --> 01:16:19,059
I don't know what to do.

1037
01:16:24,565 --> 01:16:25,805
You're gonna pay me my money.

1038
01:16:25,983 --> 01:16:26,983
Oh god, not you.

1039
01:16:27,026 --> 01:16:28,253
That's what you're gonna do, fucker.

1040
01:16:28,277 --> 01:16:30,112
Look, man, Jackie ran off with the
money,

1041
01:16:30,404 --> 01:16:31,631
I don't have any money. — who the fuck is
Jackie, man?

1042
01:16:31,655 --> 01:16:33,866
I told you, she ran out, she's
not here, man.

1043
01:16:34,158 --> 01:16:35,719
I don't where the money's at.

1044
01:16:35,743 --> 01:16:36,327
uh!

1045
01:16:36,619 --> 01:16:38,346
Where's my fucking money?— I don't
have it!

1046
01:16:38,370 --> 01:16:39,690
I don't have it! 

1047
01:16:39,872 --> 01:16:40,372
I don't have it! — motherfucker,

1048
01:16:40,664 --> 01:16:42,264
where's my fucking money?

1049
01:16:43,459 --> 01:16:45,219
Where's my fucking money?— in the
freezer!

1050
01:16:45,461 --> 01:16:46,461
It's in the freezer, man!

1051
01:16:46,712 --> 01:16:47,712
Where, fucker?

1052
01:16:47,838 --> 01:16:50,049
It's in a freezer back here.

1053
01:16:50,341 --> 01:16:53,676
Come on, motherfucker.

1054
01:16:53,968 --> 01:16:55,553
Open it, motherfucker.

1055
01:16:56,554 --> 01:16:58,389
Come on! — okay.

1056
01:17:00,767 --> 01:17:02,060
— hurry up.

1057
01:17:02,352 --> 01:17:05,563
Get the fuck outta the way, motherfucker.

1058
01:17:05,855 --> 01:17:08,775
oh, Jesus!

1059
01:17:09,067 --> 01:17:12,445


1060
01:17:15,823 --> 01:17:18,368
You fucking asshole.

1061
01:18:01,910 --> 01:18:03,036
Damn it!

1062
01:18:03,328 --> 01:18:04,579
oh, god!

1063
01:18:04,871 --> 01:18:07,082
He just ran out in front of me.

1064
01:18:08,875 --> 01:18:09,875
Is he dead?

1065
01:18:10,919 --> 01:18:13,547
Yeah. Hey, this is that Bruno guy.

1066
01:18:13,839 --> 01:18:14,965
Better call headquarters

1067
01:18:15,257 --> 01:18:16,776
and have them send out the meat wagon,

1068
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:19,427
because of your crazy driving, we're
heroes.

1069
01:18:19,719 --> 01:18:21,470
He just ran out in front of me.

1070
01:19:59,525 --> 01:20:04,446


1071
01:21:03,212 --> 01:21:05,173
Hello, this Jackie?

1072
01:21:05,464 --> 01:21:07,383
This is Corey, how you doing?

1073
01:21:07,675 --> 01:21:10,802
Listen, ah, biff was right, I found the
pound.

1074
01:21:11,094 --> 01:21:14,764
Yeah, it was in the kitchen in the coffee
can.

1075
01:21:15,056 --> 01:21:17,225
Why would I lie about something like that?

1076
