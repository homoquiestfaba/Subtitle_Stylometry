they damn ran off our deer.

00:04:00,532 --> 00:04:02,201
Well, we'll be.

17
00:04:02,201 --> 00:04:03,327
You do that?

18
00:04:03,327 --> 00:04:05,037
You run off our deer?

19
00:04:05,037 --> 00:04:09,917
Only deer that's been
through here passed that way,

20
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:11,001
about an hour ago, I reckon?

21
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:12,252

might lower his sidearm?

them at CHeckamauga.

the whole damn lot.

Was it Hood?

00:05:29,538 --> 00:05:30,372
We're heading west.

48
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:31,790
I heard there's a strike--

49
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:32,708
Shut your trap.

50
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:37,129
I ain't got no interest
in mining.

51
00:05:37,129 --> 00:05:39,673
That's like saying
you ain't got no interest

52
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:42,092
in making it rich.

53
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:43,218
Can't rightly say I do.

54
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:47,306
The fact is, I'm trying
my hand at farming.

55
00:05:47,306 --> 00:05:48,515
Farming?

56
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:50,350
You don't look like
no farmer I ever saw.

57
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,476
That's on account
of being Deputy

58
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:53,228
of Cheyenne the last two years.

59
00:05:53,228 --> 00:05:55,397
Well, Deputy, you ain't
said who you served under.

60
00:05:55,397 --> 00:05:57,399
I thought.

61
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:59,193

65
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:15,167
Under Taylor then?

66
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:16,960
Not under Taylor.

67
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,171
Not under Smith.

68
00:06:19,171 --> 00:06:23,467
Hector or Hood neither.

69
00:06:28,013 --> 00:06:30,724

Promise me, next time,

80
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:13,433
a self-respecting Southerner
asked you who you served under.

81
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,561
I ain't no traitor.

82
00:07:15,561 --> 00:07:18,188
Next time you ought to lie.

83

I ain't no liar neither.

Yeah, just 'cause
you made peace

mean the world has.

No. It seems like
a fair fight to me.

I'll just have stovetop Charlie
bring his China man over.

Yep. You're going
to be pig food.

Yes, you are you
[inaudible] dirt.

Wade, seeing as how you
ain't been around lately.

has been talking sounds

Thank you kindly if you'd
dispose of that for me.

Joe McCurry your Pa?

98
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:24,254
I reckon that depends on
which one of us you're asking.

99
00:08:25,297 --> 00:08:26,465
Don't you think you
ought to read the thing?

Just give me a
gosh darn minute.

109
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:20,727
Shit. I'm starting to have
second thoughts whether you're

110
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:23,397
going to be all right
without me.

111
00:09:23,397 --> 00:09:28,402
Hell Wade, you were my
Deputy, it ain't like we're kin.

112
00:09:28,402 --> 00:09:30,904
I ain't your responsibility.

113

go by where me

118
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:44,626
and Janie [phonetic]
don't think on him.

'Cause that's the thing about
blood, Wade, ain't nothing

to shoot you?

124
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,815
Well, ever occur to you

125

have changed his mind?

Sure is. Ain't for
his ears though.

escaped your father's lips

the dead not dishonor them

Well, this here
greedy carpetbagging son

141
00:11:53,589 --> 00:11:57,593
of a bitch is a doing your
family the damn dishonor.

142
00:11:57,593 --> 00:12:00,137
Now, you know, I would
never do Joe no disrespect,

143
00:12:00,137 --> 00:12:01,305

It'd be fine if you
come stand by Heck and me.

Pa would've wanted
it that way, I think.

147
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,739
You mean that?

148
00:12:20,282 --> 00:12:22,576
He lost to you at cards
more times that he could count.

149
00:12:22,576 --> 00:12:25,204
Still he kept on coming back.

150
00:12:25,204 --> 00:12:28,957
But you think you and
Heck might maybe want to come

151
00:12:28,957 --> 00:12:32,836
and visit the lonely old
man one of these days?

152
00:12:32,836 --> 00:12:34,588

My apologies for the
trouble my presence has caused.

00:13:05,953 --> 00:13:08,747
As far as meetings
with Three Penny Hank go,

160
00:13:08,747 --> 00:13:13,043
I'd say yours wasn't
all that bad.

161
00:13:13,043 --> 00:13:16,004
Best not begrudge
a man in mourning.

162
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:18,131
Me and your father
were very close.

163
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:22,636
Well, ain't nobody else
could stand neither of them.

164
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:28,600
Well, my thanks to you for
allowing me to be in attendance.

165
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,561
You've come to understand
a man sitting

166
00:13:30,561 --> 00:13:33,856
across a negotiating
table and your father was

167
00:13:33,856 --> 00:13:36,650
as fine as he was hardheaded.

168
00:13:38,235 --> 00:13:40,988
Well, perhaps one day soon,
you'll get to know us that well.

169
00:13:44,241 --> 00:13:46,201
Is that a fact?

170
00:13:47,286 --> 00:13:49,872
I'm not my father, Mr. Lane.

171
00:13:51,123 --> 00:13:53,667
And you certainly are not.

172
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:57,754
I do imagine you
have an asking price.

173
00:13:57,754 --> 00:14:01,091
Mr. Lane, you're paying
respects to my father.

174
00:14:01,091 --> 00:14:02,676
Business will be conducted
at the proper time.

Well, you let her
know I'll be back

179
00:14:18,859 --> 00:14:20,986
in a month's time
with a bill of sale.

180
00:14:20,986 --> 00:14:23,655

00:29:42,032 --> 00:29:45,619
There ain't nothing that keeps a
man away for coming on 10 years.

365
00:29:45,619 --> 00:29:47,913
Of course, there's a reason.

366
00:29:47,913 --> 00:29:51,667
Maybe I ought to
find out what it is.

367
00:29:51,667 --> 00:29:53,794
Maybe while you're
thinking on it,

368
00:29:53,794 --> 00:29:58,257
you got to ask yourself why the
father declared his son dead.

369
00:29:58,257 --> 00:30:07,391
(Noise)

370
00:30:20,028 --> 00:30:23,240
You're going to shoot?

371
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:26,285
Where is your [inaudible]?

372
00:30:27,828 --> 00:30:30,956
Martha believes I'll make
a better husband without it.

373
00:30:32,875 --> 00:30:35,294
Best not argue then.

374
00:30:35,294 --> 00:30:37,754
Pinfire ain't it?

375
00:30:37,754 --> 00:30:39,631
Federal I took it off
of claimed he got it

376
00:30:39,631 --> 00:30:40,757
from Jeb Stuart's [inaudible].

377
00:30:40,757 --> 00:30:46,763
I reckon he didn't
part with it easily.

378
00:30:46,763 --> 00:30:48,891
No man would.

379
00:30:52,769 --> 00:30:54,396
Good talk.

381
00:31:05,741 --> 00:31:08,869
Where you've been
these last years?

382
00:31:08,869 --> 00:31:12,664
I ain't one for
repeating myself.

383
00:31:12,664 --> 00:31:14,750
Being a Deputy in Cheyenne.

384
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:16,752
I'm a farmer now.

385
00:31:16,752 --> 00:31:20,297
That still don't explain why
you ain't never come through.

386
00:31:21,465 --> 00:31:23,550
Maybe you ought to ask Joe.

387
00:31:24,885 --> 00:31:27,596
But I guess you missed
your opportunity for that.

388
00:31:28,972 --> 00:31:32,601
You do anything
that's going to hurt her,

389
00:31:32,601 --> 00:31:36,313
there won't be no
conversation next time.

390
00:31:36,313 --> 00:31:39,316
You stole the words
right on my mouth.

392
00:31:53,997 --> 00:31:55,249
It's your responsibility.

393
00:31:55,249 --> 00:31:57,334
Got that talking too as well?

394
00:31:57,334 --> 00:31:59,419
This day I don't
know if we deserved it

395
00:31:59,419 --> 00:32:02,673
or if [inaudible] just
plain enjoyed giving it.

396
00:32:02,673 --> 00:32:04,675
I don't mean to
be out of line,

397
00:32:04,675 --> 00:32:07,553
but isn't this your
husband's responsibility?

398
00:32:07,553 --> 00:32:09,137
Look at where we live.

399
00:32:09,137 --> 00:32:11,890
There's more chores
than people around here.

400
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:13,934
How did you two
start courting?

401
00:32:13,934 --> 00:32:16,979
I wouldn't exactly
call it courting.

402
00:32:16,979 --> 00:32:19,189
Heck turned up looking for work
at Three Penny Hank's place

403
00:32:19,189 --> 00:32:22,734
and found his way over here.

404
00:32:22,734 --> 00:32:24,653
Three Penny Hank?

405
00:32:24,653 --> 00:32:27,239
He's just a fool whoremonger.

406
00:32:31,118 --> 00:32:33,203
Heck is a good man.

407
00:32:33,203 --> 00:32:35,831
He would never do me no harm.

408
00:32:35,831 --> 00:32:37,124
A man who carries
a gun like that,

409
00:32:37,124 --> 00:32:41,253
he has a certain kind of past.

416
00:33:07,196 --> 00:33:08,739
Nobody.

417
00:33:10,824 --> 00:33:14,036
I got good news this week.

418
00:33:14,036 --> 00:33:16,747
Wade is alive and well.

419
00:33:16,747 --> 00:33:18,081
Guess you probably knew that.

420
00:33:18,081 --> 00:33:25,005
but right now he's standing
right here next to me.

421
00:33:26,548 --> 00:33:29,009
He's been living up in the
Wyoming Territory where he used

422
00:33:29,009 --> 00:33:30,469
to be a Deputy Sheriff.

423
00:33:30,469 --> 00:33:33,263
He's not married
yet but not for lack

424
00:33:33,263 --> 00:33:35,057
of interest in women, I'm sure.

425
00:33:36,934 --> 00:33:40,521
And I'm hoping that
he'd be staying here

426
00:33:40,521 --> 00:33:46,235
with me and Heck for a spell.

427
00:33:46,235 --> 00:33:55,244
Is there anything
you'd like to say?

428
00:33:56,870 --> 00:34:02,209
Howdy? Would have been nice
to see you all, alive I mean.

433
00:34:27,109 --> 00:34:28,735
Sorry.

434
00:34:28,735 --> 00:34:32,030
It's all right.

435
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:39,371
We never got any bodies
back from the war.

436
00:34:39,371 --> 00:34:43,000
Not for you, not for James,

437
00:34:45,502 --> 00:34:47,171
not for Billy.

438
00:34:47,171 --> 00:34:50,132
Ma is actually buried here.

439
00:34:50,132 --> 00:34:52,176

How'd she pass?

443
00:35:06,899 --> 00:35:08,233
She got weak after the war.

444
00:35:08,233 --> 00:35:11,445
Doc said he didn't know
why but it was on account

445
00:35:11,445 --> 00:35:18,494
of losing her boys,
sure is the day is long.

446
00:35:18,494 --> 00:35:20,787
Pa, he moved us out here
thinking maybe a fresh start

447
00:35:20,787 --> 00:35:22,206
might help.

448
00:35:23,957 --> 00:35:32,966
In this place, the killers life.

449
00:35:32,966 --> 00:35:41,099
James signed on soon
after Pa told us you died.

450
00:35:42,726 --> 00:35:50,400
All the boys in town did, whole
town was so proud, mightily so.

451
00:35:52,361 --> 00:35:57,199
None came back, not a one.

452
00:35:57,199 --> 00:36:03,247
And more left, this
time Billy signed on.

453
00:36:05,749 --> 00:36:08,252
He lost a leg at Chickamauga.

455
00:36:16,927 --> 00:36:20,055
Billy died of infection
on his journey home.

456

There's something wrong with
the way they healed his leg.

and 34 out of Old Grandridge,

00:37:14,234 --> 00:37:18,197
I ended up in a hospital,

Pa took [inaudible]

wasn't too much of a surprise

when Lombardi [phonetic] came
back looking for a refund.

none of it but Wade,

Well come on in, it's not as
a whorehouse on nickel night.

543
00:44:03,268 --> 00:44:06,647
We can deal a few hands, see if
you got your father's luck too.

544
00:44:06,647 --> 00:44:12,861
Joe, he wouldn't
have changed his mind.

545
00:44:12,861 --> 00:44:14,613
One hand.

546
00:44:14,613 --> 00:44:17,699
I ain't had a visitor
since your Pa was killed.

547
00:44:17,699 --> 00:44:25,123
Well, I reckon you better
take that up with this horse.

548
00:44:25,123 --> 00:44:27,334
Hold on just one minute.

549
00:44:27,334 --> 00:44:33,841
(Noise)

550
00:44:33,841 --> 00:44:35,551
I ain't no soaker,

551
00:44:35,551 --> 00:44:39,555
but we respect the dead
before we speak on him.

552
00:44:39,596 --> 00:44:45,727
Here's to you, Joe, it
turns out I was right.

553
00:44:45,727 --> 00:44:48,355
You were a lying son of a bitch.

554
00:44:48,355 --> 00:44:49,398
You will be missed.

555
00:44:49,398 --> 00:44:55,112
(Noise)

556
00:44:55,112 --> 00:44:57,573
Joe.

557
00:44:57,614 --> 00:45:01,285
(Noise)

558
00:45:01,285 --> 00:45:04,913
You mustn't think much of me.

559
00:45:04,955 --> 00:45:08,667
I can't say I made
much of an opinion.

560
00:45:08,667 --> 00:45:13,297
No. But I know a
lot of folks who don't.

561
00:45:13,297 --> 00:45:18,552
Crazy old coot, couldn't
grow mushrooms on manure.

562
00:45:18,552 --> 00:45:24,516
But I'm a hell of a good
farmer, just ain't much water,

563
00:45:24,516 --> 00:45:26,602
not around these parts anyway.

564
00:45:28,937 --> 00:45:30,147
The letter.

565
00:45:30,147 --> 00:45:32,608
Hold your horses, son,
we're talking water here.

566
00:45:32,608 --> 00:45:38,947
My family's stead, it's
the only place that has it.

567
00:45:38,947 --> 00:45:43,577
I can see you are
the observant kind.

568
00:45:43,577 --> 00:45:44,786
What ain't so obvious is

569
00:45:44,786 --> 00:45:47,956
that there's copper
plenty around here.

570
00:45:47,998 --> 00:45:49,875
And if the mining company--

571
00:45:49,875 --> 00:45:52,794
-- if the mining
companies ain't got no water

572
00:45:52,836 --> 00:45:54,755
to work their claims, well then

573
00:45:54,755 --> 00:45:56,965
that ore ain't ever
seeing the light of day.

574
00:45:57,007 --> 00:45:59,885
They need Joe's land
and they sent some good

575
00:45:59,885 --> 00:46:04,890
for nothing carpetbagger name of
Lane to make sure they get it.

576
00:46:04,890 --> 00:46:08,143
under fire doesn't mean
he can't be snake bit.

577
00:46:08,185 --> 00:46:11,563
If and it was an accident,
how come the coffin was closed.

578
00:46:11,563 --> 00:46:15,150
That's an awful big
charge you're making.

579
00:46:15,150 --> 00:46:17,152
Well, he weren't
scalped by no Apache,

580
00:46:17,152 --> 00:46:18,737
he was throwed by a horse.

581
00:46:18,737 --> 00:46:22,950
Ain't no reason not to let us
say our last respects, unless--

582
00:46:22,950 --> 00:46:24,535
unless he weren't
throwed by no horse.

583
00:46:24,535 --> 00:46:32,125
And the law, they had
nothing to say about this?

584
00:46:32,125 --> 00:46:34,920
There ain't no
law around here.

585
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:38,215
You know Joe never said more
than two words about you

586
00:46:38,215 --> 00:46:40,634
but I wager I could
guess why he told folks

587
00:46:40,634 --> 00:46:43,846
that you was dead
Sergeant Major.

588
00:46:43,846 --> 00:46:47,182
Hell, he must have in it bad
if he felt you were the one

589
00:46:47,224 --> 00:46:51,478
that he had to call out
to 'cause like you said,

590
00:46:51,478 --> 00:46:54,314
Joe ain't one to
change his mind.

591
00:46:54,314 --> 00:47:03,240
(Noise)

592
00:47:15,961 --> 00:47:21,967
Were you present
when Joe died?

593
00:47:24,094 --> 00:47:27,306
So you've been by
Three Penny Hank's place?

594
00:47:27,306 --> 00:47:30,851
He don't take too
kindly that name.

595
00:47:30,851 --> 00:47:33,187
Nobody take too
kindly of him either.

596
00:47:36,273 --> 00:47:38,609
He mentioned a fellow
by the name of Lane.

597
00:47:38,609 --> 00:47:41,653
He came to Joe's funeral.

598
00:47:41,653 --> 00:47:43,697
Mr. Lane is the buyer.

599
00:47:44,698 --> 00:47:46,200
He kill Joe?

600
00:47:47,618 --> 00:47:48,869
Nobody killed him.

601
00:47:48,869 --> 00:47:52,414
He was thrown by a horse.

602
00:47:52,414 --> 00:47:56,376
Ain't that what killed me.?

603
00:47:58,712 --> 00:48:00,756
So you're saying I'm a liar.

604
00:48:02,257 --> 00:48:07,679
This Lane, did
he threaten you?

605
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:10,807
I don't want this land, Wade.

606
00:48:10,807 --> 00:48:13,185
The only reason we stayed

607
00:48:13,185 --> 00:48:16,647
so long is Pa wouldn't have
survived out here on his own.

608
00:48:16,647 --> 00:48:19,858
Hank seems to
be doing just fine.

609
00:48:19,858 --> 00:48:21,485
This place?

610
00:48:21,485 --> 00:48:23,654
It would kill me.

611
00:48:23,654 --> 00:48:27,157
Sure as it did our Ma.

612
00:48:27,157 --> 00:48:36,291
(Pause)

613
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:42,548
Joe threatened if I ever
came home, he'd kill me.

614
00:48:42,548 --> 00:48:47,970
And there he goes, writing
me a letter, asking me back.

615
00:48:47,970 --> 00:48:50,931
That sound like the
pride-stricken man

616
00:48:50,931 --> 00:48:52,766
that raised us up?

617
00:48:54,685 --> 00:48:56,103
Nobody killed him.

618
00:48:56,103 --> 00:49:00,732
(Pause)

619
00:49:00,732 --> 00:49:03,694
I reckon I don't know
how you can be so sure.

620
00:49:05,904 --> 00:49:06,905
Asking you as
your only family,

621
00:49:06,905 --> 00:49:09,074
will you please leave it alone?

622
00:49:09,074 --> 00:49:14,913
(Pause)

623
00:49:14,913 --> 00:49:17,916
Ain't no reason to be
scared, little sunshine.

624
00:49:17,916 --> 00:49:21,086
I will strike down anyone who
tries to harm this here family.

625
00:49:21,086 --> 00:49:25,883
(Silence)

626
00:49:25,883 --> 00:49:34,725
(Horses Galloping)

627
00:49:45,611 --> 00:49:49,781
Howdy? Didn't know
Hank brought on any hands.

628
00:49:49,781 --> 00:49:52,034
[Background Music] Howdy.

629
00:49:52,034 --> 00:49:55,162
Don't be bothering to dismount.

630
00:49:55,162 --> 00:49:57,998
(Music)

631
00:49:57,998 --> 00:50:02,085
I do not believe we had
the pleasure of acquaintance.

632
00:50:02,085 --> 00:50:03,879
You're E.J. Lane.

633
00:50:03,879 --> 00:50:08,050
Banker and killer.

634
00:50:08,050 --> 00:50:10,636
I'm going to bring you before
a judge for what you've done.

635
00:50:10,636 --> 00:50:13,180
Wait, you let him go.

636
00:50:13,180 --> 00:50:16,058
There ain't a judge for a
three-day ride from here.

637
00:50:16,058 --> 00:50:17,643
It's quite the impertinent
way to treat a guest.

638
00:50:17,643 --> 00:50:19,394
I do apologize,
Mr. Lane, we had an--

639
00:50:19,436 --> 00:50:22,481
[Inaudible] I'd appreciate
it if you get my horse.

640
00:50:22,481 --> 00:50:27,236
She ain't to be
ordered about.

641
00:50:27,236 --> 00:50:36,328
(Music)

642
00:50:42,251 --> 00:50:43,919
Wade, is it?

643
00:50:45,963 --> 00:50:51,635
I'd be glad to know what
I'm being accused of.

644
00:50:51,635 --> 00:50:55,097
Didn't figure you
were one for games.

645
00:50:55,138 --> 00:50:56,431
Wade.

646
00:50:56,473 --> 00:51:01,144
Well, you know that a
crime, whatever it may be,

647
00:51:01,144 --> 00:51:06,108
requires evidence, so
please present yours.

648
00:51:06,108 --> 00:51:15,284
(Music)

649
00:51:27,963 --> 00:51:32,092
Moving, yet meaningless.

650
00:51:32,092 --> 00:51:38,140
I'm sorry for your loss.

651
00:51:38,140 --> 00:51:40,309
I've been known for
trying to put reason

652
00:51:40,309 --> 00:51:41,310
to [inaudible] in my time.

653
00:51:41,351 --> 00:51:46,356
I have a sale to attend to.

654
00:51:47,816 --> 00:51:51,695
So you can either shoot me
in the back like a coward

655
00:51:51,695 --> 00:51:53,197
or let me be on my way.

656

I reckon you know
I ain't got no choice.

(Noise)

662
00:52:33,403 --> 00:52:39,034
See, he's made an
offer for this glass.

663
00:52:39,076 --> 00:52:48,043
But this glass is
full of whiskey.

664
00:52:48,043 --> 00:52:50,671
What you're trying to
do is buy this glass

665
00:52:50,671 --> 00:52:54,049
and get the whiskey for free.

666
00:52:54,049 --> 00:52:55,050
Why don't you
take that whiskey,

667
00:52:55,092 --> 00:52:59,555
pour it right back
in that bottle.

668
00:52:59,596 --> 00:53:01,723
I'm making a fair
counter here.

669
00:53:01,723 --> 00:53:05,394
It is a thousand dollars,
750 for all my acres,

670
00:53:05,394 --> 00:53:09,857
250 for everything on it.

671
00:53:09,857 --> 00:53:11,024
It's your property.

672
00:53:11,024 --> 00:53:15,404
I imagined you've more
to say on its fate.

673
00:53:15,404 --> 00:53:18,282
Hell of an imagination.

674
00:53:18,282 --> 00:53:21,201
(Pause)

675
00:53:21,201 --> 00:53:22,286
Got a deal?

676
00:53:22,286 --> 00:53:28,417
(Noise)

677
00:53:28,417 --> 00:53:31,503
On behalf of Mr.
Moore, Mr. Crohn

678
00:53:31,503 --> 00:53:37,342

687
00:54:13,045 --> 00:54:15,255
I was invited
here on business.

(Music)

689
00:54:25,849 --> 00:54:27,434
You just hold
on a minute here.

690
00:54:27,434 --> 00:54:32,981
I'm going to see you hung.

691
00:54:34,441 --> 00:54:37,653
Innocent men have
nothing to fear from the law.

692
00:54:39,154 --> 00:54:40,113
Where's the nearest judge?

693
00:54:40,113 --> 00:54:46,286
No reason to fear,
little sunshine.

694
00:54:46,286 --> 00:54:50,123
He ain't going to hurt you.

695
00:54:50,123 --> 00:54:56,004
Judge Hawkins in Alameda,
a three-day ride from here.

696
00:54:56,004 --> 00:54:58,173
Get up.

697
00:54:58,173 --> 00:54:59,508
No boy.

698
00:54:59,550 --> 00:55:05,180
(Footsteps)

699
00:55:05,180 --> 00:55:06,181
Hold it.

701
00:55:11,770 --> 00:55:13,188
He ain't taking leave of you.

(Music)

703
00:55:21,780 --> 00:55:22,948
I can get the drop on him.

704
00:55:22,948 --> 00:55:24,783
No, no.
I will talk to him.

705
00:55:24,783 --> 00:55:26,451
The only thing he's going
to listen to is a bullet.

706
00:55:26,451 --> 00:55:29,955
And what has he done to
make you think a crazy notion
like that?

707
00:55:29,955 --> 00:55:32,124
Goddamn it Martha!

708
00:55:32,124 --> 00:55:34,209
He dug up your father.

You stop right
there Wade McCurry.

712
00:55:48,807 --> 00:55:50,225
How's that one?

713
00:55:50,267 --> 00:55:54,188
The faster we get done with
this nonsense, the better.

714
00:55:54,188 --> 00:55:56,190
You best not try anything.

needed me to stay and now you.

719
00:56:22,758 --> 00:56:24,343
You're asking
that I let him go.

720
00:56:24,343 --> 00:56:31,183
I'm asking you to let me
be rid of this place for good.

the only kin you got left.

You sound like Pa.

733
00:57:32,202 --> 00:57:37,708
I'm nothing like him.

734
00:57:37,708 --> 00:57:39,001
Why'd he tell us you were dead?

me from leaving just

740
00:57:55,517 --> 00:58:01,607
The words he said to me
aren't words you forget.

You're a goddamn traitor.

743

kill you, I will.

No. I need to hear
you say the word.

747
00:58:26,131 --> 00:58:30,177
I was going to join the Union
Army to fight for my country.

right back up again.

your father.

You know you are on old

Suppose he was the one
doing the shooting at me.

was coming after you.

be acceptable to me.
