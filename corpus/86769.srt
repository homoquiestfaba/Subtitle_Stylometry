2
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:36,000
There.

3
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:39,550
Technicals, nine o'clock.

4
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:05,200
Oh, shit! Did you see that?

5
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:09,490
Chief, we got unarmed civilians
getting shot down here at nine o'clock.

6
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:14,460
I got it, Matt.
I don't think we can touch this.

7
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,170
This food is the property
of Mohamed Farrah Aidid!

8
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:20,510
Go back to your homes!

9
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,130
<i>Command, Super 64...</i>

10
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:26,260
<i>...we got militia shooting civilians
at the food distribution center.</i>

11
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:28,300
Request permission to engage.

12
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,180
<i>Super 64, are you taking fire? Over.</i>

13
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:32,770
<i>Negative, command.</i>

14
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:36,480
<i>U.N.'s jurisdiction, 64.
We cannot intervene.</i>

15
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:38,730
<i>- Return to base. Over.
- Roger.</i>

16
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:42,280
<i>64 returning.</i>

17
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:30,240
Ready, Mr. Atto.

18
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:44,130
Leaving.

19
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:09,110
Sir.

20
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:12,530
Keep Driving!

21
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:27,670
I'm going to be late.

22
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:30,090
Call you back.

23
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,280
General Garrison?

24
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:50,860
No, thanks. I got one.

25
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:52,950
But these are Cuban.

26
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,290
Bolivar Belicoso.

27
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:58,080
So is this.

28
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,580
Miami, my friend, is not Cuba.

29
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:12,300
I see not catching Aidid
is becoming a routine.

30
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:15,310
We weren't trying to catch Aidid.
We were trying to catch you.

31
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,720
Me?

32
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:18,980
But am I that important?

33
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:20,770
I hardly think so.

34
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:23,980
- You're just a businessman.
- Trying to make a living.

35
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:28,530
Yeah. Selling guns to Aidid's militia.

36
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:35,030
You've been here, what?

37
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:38,160
Six weeks?

38
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:42,120
Six weeks
you are trying to catch the general.

39
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:44,830
You put up reward posters.

40
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:50,340
$25,000. What is this?
Gunfight at the K.O. Corral?

41
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:53,800
It's the O.K. Corral.

42
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:58,180
Do you think bringing me in
will make him suddenly come to you?

43
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:02,190
Make him more agreeable?

44
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:05,610
You know where he sleeps.

45
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:10,900
You pay for his beds, much less his militia.

46
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:15,780
We're not leaving Somalia till we find him.

47
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:16,910
And we will find him.

48
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,580
Don't think because I grew up
without running water...

49
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:22,620
...I am simple, General.

50
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:25,540
I do know something about history.

51
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:30,630
See all this? It's simply shaping tomorrow.

52
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:35,300
A tomorrow without a lot
of Arkansas white boys' ideas in it.

53
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:38,390
Well, I wouldn't know about that.
I'm from Texas.

54
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:43,140
Mr. Garrison,
I think you shouldn't have come here.

55
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:45,980
This is civil war.

56
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:48,570
This is our war.

57
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:51,610
Not yours.

58
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:54,570
300,000 dead and counting.

59
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:59,410
That's not a war, Mr. Atto.
That's genocide.

60
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:03,830
Now, you enjoy that tea, you hear?

61
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,630
How'd he strike you?

62
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:12,840
Urbane, sophisticated, cruel.

63
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:15,050
Yeah, he's a good catch.

64
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,470
It'll take time, but Aidid will feel the loss.

65
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:20,430
I'm not sure time is something we got
in great supply.

66
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:25,020
This isn't Iraq, you know.
Much more complicated than that.

67
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:27,100
Boss, most of Washington might disagree.

68
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:32,320
They've been calling for situation reports
every morning this week.

69
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:38,450
Well, tell them the situation is fragile.

70
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:46,040
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm Cliff "Elvis" Wolcott.</i>

71
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:47,710
<i>I'll be your pilot today.</i>

72
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:51,880
Federal regulations designate this
a non-smoking Black Hawk helicopter.

73
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:56,420
Those in Mogadishu frequent flyer program
will earn 100 free credits.

74
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:01,970
And as always, the air sickness bags
are in the seatback in front of you.

75
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:05,140
Number one indications are good, Cliff.
Put her on two.

76
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:08,140
<i>You're still clear.</i>

77
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:25,040
<i>61, this is 64. Go to UHF secure.</i>

78
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:27,370
I've got some bad news.

79
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:30,380
"Limo" is a word, Durant.
I don't want to hear about it.

80
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,250
<i>It is not a word.
It's an abbreviation of a word.</i>

81
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,380
"Limo" is a word in common usage.

82
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:39,260
That is the key phrase in Scrabble,
my good friend. Common usage.

83
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:42,300
If it's not in the dictionary it doesn't count!

84
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:44,470
<i>It doesn't have to be in the dictionary!</i>

85
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,770
<i>It does have to be in the dictionary!</i>

86
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:50,940
When we get back to the base,
it's coming off.

87
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:54,400
<i>You touch my "limo"
and I'll spank you, Nightstalker.</i>

88
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:56,690
Yeah, promises.

89
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:59,240
That's a nice beach down there.

90
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:00,740
How's the water?

91
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:06,450
Yeah, it's nice and warm.
And it's loaded with sharks.

92
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,710
- Name.
- Todd.

93
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:16,250
- Last name.
- Blackburn.

94
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,260
First name, Todd.

95
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:21,300
- So, what's it like?
- What's what like?

96
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:22,680
Mogadishu. The fighting.

97
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:27,720
- Serial number.
- 72163427.

98
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:31,480
Firstly, it's "the Mog" or simply "Mog".
No one calls it Mogadishu here.

99
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:35,440
Secondly, I wouldn't know
about the fighting, so don't ask.

100
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:36,940
Why not?

101
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:40,360
Didn't I just say, "Don't ask"?

102
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:44,820
You look like you're about 12,
so let me explain something to you.

103
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:49,870
I have a rare and mysterious skill
that precludes me from doing missions.

104
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:50,910
Typing.

105
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:54,670
- Can you type?
- No.

106
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:59,590
- Date of birth.
- 2-27-75.

107
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:07,470
Well, I'm here to kick some ass.

108
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:13,770
<i>Let's bring it in.</i>

109
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:29,830
Nice, man! Very smooth!

110
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,330
Single shot through the engine block.

111
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:36,840
Shit, that's a shame. That was a nice jeep.

112
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:01,740
Cease fire! Cease fire!

113
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:03,070
Check your weapons!

114
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,860
Sergeant Eversmann.

115
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:10,240
Private First Class Blackburn.

116
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:11,830
Yeah?

117
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,580
Reporting for duty.

118
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:18,040
Not to me. You're reporting to Lt. Beales.
He should be here somewhere.

119
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:20,210
Can I leave him with you?

120
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:22,590
Yeah, go ahead.

121
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,840
- You brought your weapon.
- Yes, sir.

122
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:26,970
Want me to shoot? I'm rested.

123
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:31,640
- When did you get in?
- Just now, Sergeant.

124
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:37,690
Hey, who's hungry?

125
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:02,050
What is this, Sarg'nt?
Another taxpayer-funded Delta safari?

126
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:05,920
- Not if General Garrison is asking.
- I'm asking.

127
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:09,260
Have a nice meal, Captain.

128
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,970
- Hey, man, there's a line.
- I know.

129
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:19,730
- Well, this isn't the back of it.
- Yeah, I know.

130
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:22,610
Sergeant. Sergeant.

131
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:23,900
What's going on here?

132
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:26,990
Some aerial target practice, sir.
Didn't want to leave it behind.

133
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,280
I'm talking about your weapon.

134
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:32,030
Delta or no Delta, that's a hot weapon.

135
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:35,410
You know better than that.
Safety should be on at all times on base.

136
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:39,540
Well, this is my safety, sir.

137
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:43,590
Let it go, sir.
The guy hasn't eaten in a couple of days.

138
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:47,300
You Delta boys
are a bunch of undisciplined cowboys.

139
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:49,340
Let me tell you something, Sarg'nt.

140
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:53,180
When we get on a five-yard line,
you're going to need my Rangers.

141
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:57,020
Y'all better learn to be team players.

142
00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:00,270
We're done here.

143
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:11,820
Speak up. You say this is your safety?

144
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:14,530
Well, this is my boot, son.

145
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:18,120
And it will fit up your ass
with the proper amount of force.

146
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:21,960
- Is that a Jersey accent?
- I'm trying to do this, give me a break.

147
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:23,960
Take those sunglasses off.

148
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:26,380
Delta wants to wear Oakleys,
that's their business.

149
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:30,380
I don't want to see them on you again.

150
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:33,850
<i>Is that a hot weapon?</i>

151
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:38,930
Is that your move?

152
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:41,190
Is my hand on the piece?

153
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,070
I can mate you in three whatever you do.

154
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:48,990
I'd keep my eye on that queen
before counseling others.

155
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:52,740
Well, she's just lying in wait.

156
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,660
Yikes.

157
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:01,580
It's good. You're really improving.

158
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:04,460
If I may make a suggestion-- Observation.

159
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:05,710
Go ahead.

160
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,630
- It's a children's book, right?
- Right.

161
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,880
They are not supposed to scare
the living shit out of the children.

162
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:16,720
This is the part of the story
where our knight is slaying the dragon.

163
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:19,470
That's scary.
Besides, my daughter loves this stuff.

164
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:22,100
Thought you finished that last week.

165
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:25,150
You done?

166
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:28,610
Hey, we are at the 10-yard line here, men.

167
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,610
You understand?

168
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:33,610
Can you count? One, two, ten.

169
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,950
Okay? Where are my running backs?

170
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:39,240
Where are my running backs?

171
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:42,580
Hey, I didn't see you at church on Sunday.

172
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:44,750
You had something more important to do?

173
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,210
Not on Sunday, you don't. Not anymore.

174
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:51,340
I will make you believe, you understand?

175
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:08,020
Pretty funny, hoo-ah?

176
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:14,570
It was a good impression.
I recognize myself.

177
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:17,780
All right, carry on.

178
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:21,240
- I'd like a word, specialist.
- Sir.

179
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:24,910
You understand why we have
a chain of command, don't you?

180
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:25,920
Roger that, sir.

181
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:29,460
If you ever undermine me again,
you'll clean latrines with your tongue...

182
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:32,550
...till you taste no difference
between shit and French fries.

183
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,760
- Are we clear?
- Hoo-ah, sir.

184
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:36,510
All right.

185
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:43,680
Listen to this:

186
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:48,770
If one skinny kills another his clan owes
the dead guy's clan a hundred camels.

187
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:50,190
A hundred camels.

188
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,940
Camels. I wouldn't pay one camel.

189
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:55,700
Must be a lot of fucking camel debt.

190
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:57,780
Is that really true, Lieutenant?

191
00:17:58,030 --> 00:18:00,240
Ask Sgt. Eversmann. He likes skinnies.

192
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:03,370
Sgt. Eversmann,
you really like the skinnies?

193
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:07,250
It's not that I like them or I don't like them.
I respect them.

194
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:12,050
See, what you guys fail to realize
is the sergeant is a bit of an idealist.

195
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:15,720
He believes in this mission
down to his bones. Don't you, Sergeant?

196
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:19,180
Look, these people, they have no jobs...

197
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:23,350
...no food, no education, no future.

198
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:27,020
I just figure that, I mean,
we have two things that we can do.

199
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:28,650
We can help...

200
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:32,150
...or we can sit back and watch
the country destroy itself on CNN.

201
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,480
Right?

202
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:36,610
I don't know about you guys,
but I was trained to fight.

203
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:38,780
Are you trained to fight, Sergeant?

204
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:42,740
Well, I think I was trained
to make a difference, Kurth.

205
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:46,870
Like the man said, he's an idealist.

206
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,710
Oh, wait. This is my favorite part.

207
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:56,550
<i>Stay away from the cans!</i>

208
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,590
<i>Die, gas-pumper!</i>

209
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,180
<i>Stay away from those cans!</i>

210
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,560
No, no, stay back.

211
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:11,650
He's having a seizure.
Put something in his mouth.

212
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:18,360
John, it's okay. John, it's okay. It's okay.

213
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:06,740
Well, he'll be fine. But not in this army.

214
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:11,210
He's out of the game.
He's epileptic, going home.

215
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:16,960
I'm putting you in charge of his chalk.

216
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:19,880
- You got a problem with that?
- No, sir.

217
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:22,050
It's a big responsibility.

218
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:24,680
Your men will look to you
to make the right decisions.

219
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:27,810
Their lives depend on it.

220
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,680
All right.

221
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:32,850
- Rangers lead the way, sir.
- All the way.

222
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:36,110
Good luck.

223
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:23,490
<i>A meeting of Aidid's senior cabinet
may take place today at 1500 hours.</i>

224
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:26,410
I say "may" because we all know by now...

225
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:29,870
...with the intel we get on the street,
nothing is certain.

226
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:33,540
This is actual intel
confirmed by three sources.

227
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:37,080
Two tier-one personalities may be present:

228
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:41,170
Omar Salad, Aidid's top political advisor...

229
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:43,840
...and Abdi Hassan Awale, interior minister.

230
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:46,720
These are the guys we're after.

231
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:48,640
Today we go.

232
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:51,350
Same mission template as before.

233
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:55,690
1545, Assault Force Delta
will infiltrate the target building...

234
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:58,060
...and seize all suspects within.

235
00:21:58,310 --> 00:22:02,110
Security Force Rangers: 4 Ranger chalks,
under command of Capt. Steele...

236
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:04,490
...will rope in at 1546...

237
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:08,410
...and hold a four-corner perimeter
around the target building.

238
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:09,990
No one gets in or out.

239
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,830
Extraction Force:

240
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:16,580
Lt. Colonel McKnight's humvee column
will drive in at 1547...

241
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:20,710
...on Hawlwadig Road
and hold just short of the Olympic Hotel.

242
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,380
Wait for the green light.

243
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:24,460
Now once Delta gives the word...

244
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:29,720
...McKnight's column will go to the target
and load the prisoners onto trucks.

245
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:32,310
Immediately after
the prisoners are loaded...

246
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:36,640
...the four Ranger chalks
will collapse back to the target building...

247
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:38,190
...load up on humvees...

248
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:42,360
...and the entire ground force
will exfil the 3 miles back to base.

249
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:46,700
Mission time, no longer than 30 minutes.

250
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:51,740
Now, I had requested light armor
and AC-130 Spectre gunships...

251
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:56,000
...but Washington, in all its wisdom,
decided against this.

252
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:58,080
Too high-profile.

253
00:22:58,330 --> 00:23:01,460
So Black Hawks and Little Birds
will provide the air cover...

254
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:03,960
...with miniguns and 2.75 rockets.

255
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:05,550
Colonel Harrell.

256
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:10,390
In the C-2 bird, Colonel Matthews
will coordinate the air mission...

257
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,510
...and I will coordinate ground forces.

258
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:14,890
Colonel Matthews.

259
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:18,690
Mission launch code word is Irene.

260
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:21,480
Questions?

261
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:24,770
Which building is it, sir?

262
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:30,160
We're confirming that now.
Somewhere near the Bakara market.

263
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:34,160
I don't choose the time or place
of their meetings.

264
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:36,290
I didn't say a word, sir.

265
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:39,750
Make no mistake,
once you're in the Bakara market...

266
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,670
...you're in an entirely hostile district.

267
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:45,250
Don't underestimate their capabilities.

268
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:49,010
We'll be in friendly neighborhoods
before we hit the market...

269
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:53,890
...so remember the rules of engagement:
No one fires unless fired upon.

270
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:57,220
Now, let's go get this thing done.

271
00:23:57,470 --> 00:24:00,640
Good luck, gentlemen.

272
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:06,980
What's the matter, Danny?
Something you don't like?

273
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:09,360
No Spectre gunships,
daylight instead of night...

274
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:12,030
...afternoon when they're all fucked up
on khat...

275
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:16,580
...only part of the city Aidid can mount
a counter-attack on short notice...

276
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:19,660
- What's not to like?
- Life's imperfect.

277
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:23,630
For you two, circling above it at 500 feet,
it's imperfect.

278
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:29,090
Down in the street, it's unforgiving.

279
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:05,750
What the fuck, Smith?

280
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,840
- Well?
- Well, what?

281
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:10,670
We going?

282
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:15,760
- Why should I tell you that?
- Because I'm me.

283
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:19,680
Yeah. 3:00. Downtown.

284
00:25:19,930 --> 00:25:21,430
- Bakara market.
- All right.

285
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:25,480
Listen, Smith, I need you to back me up
out there today, all right?

286
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:28,480
Keep sharp.

287
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:31,650
Yes, sir, Sergeant Eversmann.

288
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:34,650
Ev, it's going to be nothing, man.

289
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:37,780
Nothing.

290
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:44,790
It's all in the grind, Sizemore.
Can't be too fine, can't be too coarse.

291
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:47,830
This, my friend, is a science.

292
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,880
You're looking at the guy
that believed the commercials.

293
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:53,210
About "be all you can be".

294
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:56,300
I made coffee through Desert Storm.

295
00:25:56,550 --> 00:25:59,720
I made coffee through Panama,
while everyone else got to fight...

296
00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:02,310
...got to be a Ranger.

297
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:08,940
Now it's "Grimesy, black, one sugar"
or "Grimesy, got a powdered anywhere?"

298
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:13,860
- What happened to you?
- Ping-Pong accident.

299
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:15,820
What?

300
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:17,820
So guess what.

301
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:20,780
Your wish has been granted.
You're going out today.

302
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:22,660
You're fucking me.

303
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:25,330
You're taking my place
assisting the 60 gunner.

304
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:29,670
Sergeant Eversmann said
to get your stuff and get ready.

305
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,800
It's what you wanted, isn't it?

306
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:34,920
Oh, yeah.

307
00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:36,220
Hell, yeah.

308
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:39,930
Grimesy, stick with Waddell
and give him ammo when he needs it.

309
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:41,350
- Hoo-ah?
- Hoo-ah.

310
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:46,020
I wouldn't worry about that. Generally
speaking, Somalis can't shoot for shit.

311
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:50,190
Just watch out for the sammys
throwing the rocks, and you'll be fine.

312
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,360
Might even be fun.

313
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:55,320
D-boys do their thing now.
All we got to do is cover them.

314
00:26:55,570 --> 00:26:59,110
Chopper's going to cover us,
and we'll be all right.

315
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:03,280
Look, you guys,
this is my first time as chalk leader...

316
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:06,830
...but, this isn't our first time out together.
This is serious.

317
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:10,830
We're Rangers, not some sorry-ass JROTC.

318
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,790
We're elite.

319
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:16,090
Let's act like it out there. Hoo-ah?

320
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:19,550
Any questions?

321
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:26,680
We're going to be okay.

322
00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:30,310
Grab your gear. Let's move out.

323
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:54,630
You're not going to need that, dude.
We're not out there long enough.

324
00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:02,800
You won't need that, either.

325
00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:04,930
We'll be back before dark.

326
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:07,680
You might as well take dope
and beer instead.

327
00:28:07,930 --> 00:28:09,180
What?

328
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:12,900
Ammo, dude. Take ammo.

329
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:22,200
Let me tell you something, Grimes.
You got 50 pounds of gear.

330
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:23,450
You don't need another 12.

331
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:27,950
I don't know about you,
I don't plan on getting shot running away.

332
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,660
Well, I better keep mine in.

333
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:30,790
Grimes.

334
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,960
Most important thing:

335
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:38,000
Remember, when everyone is shooting,
shoot in the same direction.

336
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:48,350
Look at this.
He's taping his blood type to his boots.

337
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:52,190
- That's bad luck.
- No, it's smart.

338
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,770
All Delta do that.

339
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:57,270
That's bad luck too, man.

340
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:00,190
Come on, let's go.

341
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:06,660
It's a good thing
you're right-handed, Adonis.

342
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:13,000
- If not, I don't know what you'd do.
- You're a funny guy, man.

343
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:17,420
- I'm not taking no death letter.
- We have a deal.

344
00:29:18,670 --> 00:29:20,670
I'll give it to you back in an hour.

345
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:26,340
- Blackburn, you okay?
- Excited.

346
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:30,220
In a good way.
I've been training my whole life for this.

347
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:32,810
You ever shot at anybody before?

348
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:35,600
No, sir.

349
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:38,440
Me neither.

350
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,390
Think he's reliable?

351
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:17,690
Well, we'll see. It's his first time out.

352
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,490
- Tell him to turn his damn radio off.
- Yes, sir.

353
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:28,410
Tell him to turn his radio off.

354
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:33,200
Abdi, you need to turn your radio off.

355
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:44,170
<i>Hi. You've reached Stephanie and Randy,
leave us a message. Thank you.</i>

356
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:48,930
<i>Hey, baby, it's me. Are you there?</i>

357
00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:51,550
<i>Pick up if you're there.</i>

358
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:55,140
I'm just calling
to make sure everything's all right.

359
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:58,650
I'll call you in a couple hours.

360
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:01,520
You'd better not be sleeping.

361
00:31:01,770 --> 00:31:04,690
Your move, Randy.

362
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:07,200
<i>I'm missing you.</i>

363
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:10,410
I love you, baby.

364
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:13,540
Hello? Hello?

365
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:17,000
Thanks, bud.

366
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:20,080
You know, it's kind of funny.

367
00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:24,550
Beautiful beach, beautiful sun.

368
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,970
Could almost be a good place to visit.

369
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:30,180
Almost.

370
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:35,060
You don't think we should be here.

371
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:40,850
You know what I think?
It don't really matter what I think.

372
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:45,360
Once that first bullet goes past your head,
politics and all that shit...

373
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:48,150
...just goes right out the window.

374
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,950
I just want to do it right today.

375
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:56,580
Just watch your corner.
Get all your men back here alive.

376
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:24,060
Now, is this supposed to be the place,
or did his car just take a dump?

377
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:26,020
<i>Abdi, come in.</i>

378
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:30,280
Abdi, can you hear me? Is this the place?

379
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:35,780
<i>Abdi, come in.</i>

380
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:42,670
<i>Can you hear me? Abdi.</i>

381
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:45,880
<i>Abdi, come in. Is this the place?</i>

382
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:48,710
To my right side, above the cafe.

383
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,220
<i>He says this is the building.</i>

384
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:53,260
He's certain?

385
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:55,300
<i>Abdi, you need to be sure.</i>

386
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:58,470
Are you sure?

387
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:03,690
Well, it's down the road,
two blocks over on my left.

388
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:06,150
But there's too many militia.

389
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,860
<i>If I go closer, they might shoot me.</i>

390
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:12,200
<i>Now he's saying the building's
a couple blocks down...</i>

391
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:15,320
...but if he's seen outside it, he'll be shot.

392
00:33:15,570 --> 00:33:17,700
I'll fucking shoot him myself.

393
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:21,330
Tell him I want his skinny ass
parked in front of the building.

394
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:24,670
He's not getting paid
till he does exactly that.

395
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:27,960
Three miles to the target.
We're never off the main roads.

396
00:33:28,210 --> 00:33:31,210
At K-four traffic circle, we turn north,
then east on National...

397
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:34,470
...and we wait until extraction of prisoners
is complete here.

398
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,510
Then we roll up in force on Hawlwadig...

399
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:40,770
...load the prisoners, the assault-blocking
forces and bring them back.

400
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:43,140
Home in an hour. Okay?

401
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:46,520
There will be some shooting.
Bakara market is the Wild West.

402
00:33:46,770 --> 00:33:50,360
But be careful what you shoot at.
People do live there.

403
00:33:50,610 --> 00:33:53,450
Hoo-ah.

404
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:09,630
Last one of these guys shot himself
in the head playing Russian roulette.

405
00:34:21,770 --> 00:34:24,600
<i>Sir, the vehicle is stopped.</i>

406
00:34:24,850 --> 00:34:29,020
So this is the real deal now.
He's sure this time.

407
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:34,900
<i>- He sounds scared shitless.
- Good. That's always a good sign.</i>

408
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:46,830
<i>That's it. That's our signal.</i>

409
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,670
All right.

410
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:52,840
All QRF out of the airspace.

411
00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:56,760
All QRF out of the airspace.

412
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:06,180
All units, Irene. I say again, Irene.

413
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:16,740
<i>Check in when ready. Barber 51 up
and ready. Star 41 up and ready.</i>

414
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:18,610
Irene!

415
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:20,950
<i>Copy, Irene.</i>

416
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:24,040
Fucking Irene!

417
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:38,720
Come on.

418
00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:44,930
Good luck, boys.

419
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:46,730
Be careful.

420
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:50,650
No one gets left behind.

421
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:52,900
What's wrong?

422
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:57,070
Nothing. He's just never done that before.

423
00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:00,320
Aw, fuck!

424
00:36:02,990 --> 00:36:04,910
Let's go.

425
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:09,460
Sergeant Struecker. Let's roll.

426
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:49,370
<i>Two minutes.</i>

427
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:52,580
Two minutes.

428
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:38,830
Why are they burning tires?

429
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:43,460
Signals to the militia that we're coming!

430
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:47,300
<i>Okay, 56, looks like there's some friendlies
on the ground.</i>

431
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:52,100
<i>Looks like I've got a tally on the voice.</i>

432
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:59,480
One minute.

433
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:02,520
One minute.

434
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:07,740
What's that for?

435
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:12,490
Last rope, I almost bit my tongue off.

436
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:45,360
<i>Touching base.</i>

437
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:50,820
<i>Two feet, one foot...</i>

438
00:40:51,070 --> 00:40:53,240
<i>...clear.</i>

439
00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:58,040
<i>Little Birds touching down at target.</i>

440
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:43,160
Ropes!

441
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:47,460
Go! Go! Go!

442
00:41:52,970 --> 00:41:56,550
<i>Chalk One troops are on the deck.
Chalk Two deployed.</i>

443
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:01,680
<i>This is McKnight.
Uniform 64 approaching staging area.</i>

444
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:13,490
Down! Get down!

445
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:15,410
Down! Stay down!

446
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:17,200
Get down! Everybody down!

447
00:42:17,450 --> 00:42:18,870
You, down!

448
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:19,950
Get down!

449
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:22,790
On the floor.

450
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:30,170
Let's go, let's go!

451
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:32,760
Grimesy! No fear!

452
00:42:33,010 --> 00:42:36,380
Oh, yeah, right!

453
00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:41,470
<i>Rangers securing perimeter. Four corners.</i>

454
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:44,770
Colonel, they're shooting at us!

455
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:46,810
Colonel, they're shooting at us!

456
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:49,940
Well, shoot back!

457
00:42:52,190 --> 00:42:55,110
<i>This is 64. Chalks on the ground,
going into holding pattern.</i>

458
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:57,990
<i>This is 62, delivered chalks.
Going to cover pattern.</i>

459
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:02,330
<i>Super 62, take up an overhead pattern
to provide sniper cover. Over.</i>

460
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:07,500
<i>This is Super 65. Chalks on the ground,
going into holding pattern.</i>

461
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:15,340
Go, Blackburn, go! Go!

462
00:43:15,590 --> 00:43:18,430
Go, Blackburn!

463
00:43:19,390 --> 00:43:20,510
RPG!

464
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:23,770
Hold on!

465
00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:27,940
No!

466
00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:39,240
<i>C-2, we got a man fallen.</i>

467
00:43:39,490 --> 00:43:42,160
<i>Super-61, you're a sitting duck.</i>

468
00:43:42,410 --> 00:43:45,580
<i>Take up overhead pattern
to provide sniper cover. Over.</i>

469
00:43:45,830 --> 00:43:49,080
<i>Roger that. 61 coming out.</i>

470
00:43:49,330 --> 00:43:53,670
<i>13, go ahead. I need you to move to
the north of the street.</i>

471
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:57,550
<i>Right to the north. Right there. Over.</i>

472
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:59,720
Doc! Doc Schmid!

473
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:01,300
Come on!

474
00:44:01,550 --> 00:44:05,720
Schmid, we got a man hit.

475
00:44:06,140 --> 00:44:08,890
- Where's he hit?
- He's not. He fell.

476
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:12,650
- What?
- He fell.

477
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:16,070
Why aren't you shooting?

478
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,150
We're not being shot at yet!

479
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:19,740
How can you tell?

480
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:21,360
A hiss means it's close.

481
00:44:21,610 --> 00:44:23,030
A snap means--

482
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:26,660
Now they're shooting at us!

483
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:36,630
Galentine!

484
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:41,630
Get me Captain Steele!
Get me Captain Steele!

485
00:44:41,890 --> 00:44:45,100
Juliet 64, this is Juliet 25. Come in. Over.

486
00:44:45,350 --> 00:44:47,100
Blackburn, can you hear me?

487
00:44:47,350 --> 00:44:50,560
Juliet 64, this is 25. Come in. Over.

488
00:44:50,810 --> 00:44:52,980
I can't get him!

489
00:44:53,230 --> 00:44:56,570
Juliet 64, this is Chalk Four!
We've got a man down!

490
00:44:56,820 --> 00:44:58,650
We need to get him out of here! Over.

491
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:02,570
This is 64. Say again, 25. Over.

492
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:06,870
<i>We've got a man down! Over.</i>

493
00:45:06,910 --> 00:45:10,330
Take a breath, 25, and calm down. Over.

494
00:45:10,580 --> 00:45:13,080
<i>- Man down!
- Missed that, 25.</i>

495
00:45:13,330 --> 00:45:15,000
<i>- Fuck it.
- Say again.</i>

496
00:45:15,250 --> 00:45:17,300
Matt, it's a long way to the humvees!

497
00:45:17,550 --> 00:45:20,920
We'll get a stretcher in here.
Get him to the target building.

498
00:45:21,170 --> 00:45:22,470
What did he say?

499
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:27,140
<i>Super 61,
we got a man wounded on the ground.</i>

500
00:45:27,390 --> 00:45:30,310
- Stretcher!
- Get me a stretcher!

501
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:32,310
Come on. Stretcher.

502
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:34,600
Come on, come on!

503
00:45:34,850 --> 00:45:37,520
Grab this end!

504
00:45:37,770 --> 00:45:39,980
Let's go!

505
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:42,240
- All right.
- Go.

506
00:45:42,490 --> 00:45:44,780
Get him to the humvees.
We'll hold down the corner.
