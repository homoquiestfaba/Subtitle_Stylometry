00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:20,771
The Game of Their Lives (2005)

3
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:25,192
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome
to Robert F. stadium Kennedy,

4
00:00:25,234 --> 00:00:27,778
All-Star Game for 2004.

5
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,011
See? This is the kind of player
that always goes on.

6
00:01:34,011 --> 00:01:36,054
- Excuse me, Mr. McSkimming?
- Yes, why?

7
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:40,767
- Hi I'm Matthew Tucker.
- Oh, sure. How are you? Sit.

8
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:45,397
- Thank you. You like places?
- Yes, they are great.

9
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:51,695
And by the way, you can call me Dent.
This is my granddaughter, Emily.

10
00:01:51,737 --> 00:01:55,866
- Striker, kick with both feet.
- Chaser, huh?

11
00:01:55,908 --> 00:01:58,994
It will be a star someday.

12
00:01:58,994 --> 00:02:03,207
Dent So, you thought in his time,
I would see a football match

13
00:02:03,207 --> 00:02:05,792
a stadium in the United States
as big as this?

14
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:08,378
I always thought it would just
a matter of time

15
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:12,591
so we reached the rest of the
world with our passion for the game.

16
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:15,719
And you were single U.S. reporter

17
00:02:15,761 --> 00:02:18,764
World Cup 1950.
Right?

18
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:20,891
I was just doing my job.

19
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:22,935
I heard that he paid his
passage itself there.

20
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:26,897
There was a lot of St.
Louisiana cared

21
00:02:26,897 --> 00:02:30,817
a lot from our boys and their adventure.

22
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:34,738
But of course I
would in any way,

23
00:02:34,738 --> 00:02:38,659
even if there had
a business reason.

24
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:41,787
- You want me to tell you everything?
- Yes, very much.

25
00:02:41,787 --> 00:02:48,001
- And where do I begin?
- How about the beginning?

26
00:02:48,043 --> 00:02:55,300
I and most of those guys,
were all from St. Louis

27
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:59,429
In an area called "The Hill"
"La Montagna."

28
00:02:59,471 --> 00:03:05,227
Populated by Italian immigrants
at the turn of the century.

29
00:03:05,269 --> 00:03:10,941
Like many communities
immigrants across the U.S.,

30
00:03:10,941 --> 00:03:17,239
"The Hill" had a foot in the old
continent, and another in the new world.

31
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:20,325
Very proud of the two places.

32
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:26,081
An area of ??approximately
20 square blocks.

33
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:31,795
"The Hill" was small and contained.

34
00:03:31,837 --> 00:03:41,180
His world revolved around work
hard, family, food and the Church.

35
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:44,308
Neighbors knew each
other and their children and cousins.

36
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:47,477
And who was a devotee of St. Ambrose
and who was not.

37
00:03:50,606 --> 00:03:56,862
All went to Sunday Mass,
weddings and funerals ...

38
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:05,704
You're late.

39
00:04:13,504 --> 00:04:17,674
Harry, my friend, you sound like
that will have a heart attack.

40
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:22,930
I have to be Northside
before the end of the day.

41
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:26,016
Tell a Soul, that the search at 7:00.

42
00:04:26,058 --> 00:04:28,143
Another English lesson?

43
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:32,314
Sure, I'll take her to the movies
is a good place to learn.

44
00:04:32,356 --> 00:04:35,442
Because she needs
learn English if it is

45
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:38,529
back to Guadalajara in 2 weeks?

46
00:04:39,571 --> 00:04:40,614
See ya!

47
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:02,010
Let's get on the floor.

48
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,096
We have to be
Northside in 20 minutes.

49
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:16,900
Gino! It's time, come on.

50
00:05:27,536 --> 00:05:31,206
People of "The Hill" loved baseball.

51
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:34,835
Yogi Berra and Joe Garagiola grew up there.

52
00:05:34,877 --> 00:05:38,005
But his greatest passion was
reserved for football

53
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:42,176
Or, as we call it here, soccer.

54
00:06:01,945 --> 00:06:08,243
In "The Hill" on any given day, you could
find the best players in the country

55
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:13,957
Frank Borghi, played baseball and
was potential for a professional league.

56
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:19,713
Frank had a nose for the ball, and
ability to prevent it from going into the goal.

57
00:06:19,755 --> 00:06:23,842
No comparison with
any goalie I've ever seen.

58
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:26,929
And I've seen enough.
It was my job

59
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:33,227
inform about the St. Louisianas
local semi-professional teams and leagues.

60
00:06:33,268 --> 00:06:35,312
For me, it was not working.

61
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:40,567
It was a daily pleasure in
Players to watch

62
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:45,781
could play in any
place in the highest level.

63
00:06:45,781 --> 00:06:49,409
As Gino Parian, fast and strong,

64
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:53,080
giving great passes and scoring goals.

65
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:57,209
Gino played even better with the
Francis "Pee Wee" Wallace.

66
00:06:57,292 --> 00:07:00,295
A "Pee Wee" he played the field.

67
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:06,093
In the field he was all
Seriously, playing with a

68
00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:11,807
intensity as no
another in St. Louis.

69
00:07:11,849 --> 00:07:18,063
A great striker fast, agile.
He was always working toward the goal.

70
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:23,819
Attacking alone or
with Gino. There was

71
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:29,575
denying the ability
Pee Wee Wallace

72
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:39,960
Looking for this?

73
00:07:48,302 --> 00:07:54,600
He also had Charlie Colombo, dubbed
of "Gloves" because he always wore gloves.

74
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,686
He liked to use force.
Correctly answered at all.

75
00:07:57,728 --> 00:08:01,899
Never a player who competed with
he did not want to put in the hospital.

76
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:08,113
- No!
- What are you talking about? one bid was clean.

77
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:12,242
Charlie Gloves, play nice.

78
00:08:12,284 --> 00:08:13,869
Hey! what are you doing?
Is helping the enemy?

79
00:08:13,869 --> 00:08:15,412
I am dating his sister.

80
00:08:15,454 --> 00:08:16,455
So what?

81
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:34,181
Harry Keough. Smart, smart.

82
00:08:34,223 --> 00:08:39,436
Always seemed to be in
right place at the right time.

83
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:02,376
That's right guys, good game.

84
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:12,803
- Hey, Harry. where it came from?
- That was for you Borghi.

85
00:09:12,845 --> 00:09:14,888
- Nice kick.
- Great game Frank.

86
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:16,890
Thank you.

87
00:09:16,932 --> 00:09:18,976
Anyway,
let's talk about your goal.

88
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:23,730
Well, to mark the Borghi, or
you are very good or very lucky.

89
00:09:23,772 --> 00:09:28,402
- And today I was very lucky.
- You always moves to the left of the ball

90
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:30,487
Yeah, I do not really work
with the other leg.

91
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:32,239
Now you need to
working speed.

92
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:33,115
I know.

93
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:38,287
How about a train
shortly after the games?

94
00:09:38,287 --> 00:09:41,957
That sounds good.

95
00:09:41,999 --> 00:09:47,212
I waited a little until the paperwork
solve, but now it's official.

96
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:50,340
tests for the football team
U.S.,

97
00:09:50,382 --> 00:09:53,385
will be made here in St. Louis.

98
00:09:53,427 --> 00:09:56,305
The teams come from the east
here to play with

99
00:09:56,305 --> 00:09:59,183
best in our area
next Friday.

100
00:09:59,224 --> 00:10:02,060
When is the best team
chosen, we will go to

101
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:04,897
New York to train.
And make an exhibition game.

102
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:09,067
And then we go to Brazil.

103
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:11,195
We will play at least
3 games in our key.

104
00:10:11,195 --> 00:10:13,280
How long will all this take?

105
00:10:14,323 --> 00:10:18,452
There will be 10 days of training and
maybe 2 or 3 weeks off.

106
00:10:18,493 --> 00:10:21,622
It will be difficult for some of us
take time out of our work.

107
00:10:21,663 --> 00:10:26,752
Gentlemen, I apologize for the short
time, I know it will be difficult.

108
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:29,421
Will be happy to
know who will win $ 100

109
00:10:29,421 --> 00:10:32,007
per week, $ 5 per day for food.

110
00:10:32,049 --> 00:10:36,178
And do not forget, this is a trip
free to New York and Brazil.

111
00:10:38,263 --> 00:10:40,349
What is the problem, Gino?

112
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:48,190
No way, I can not do that.
I'm getting married in two weeks.

113
00:10:48,732 --> 00:10:53,904
- Dino the girl is crazy about you.
- Charlie quiet

114
00:10:53,946 --> 00:10:57,032
Look, you'll have to postpone it Gino
we need you.

115
00:10:57,074 --> 00:11:01,203
Walter can not do that,
the invitations have been delivered.

116
00:11:01,203 --> 00:11:03,288
Everything is already marked

117
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:06,375
My God, I really
I wish I could go.

118
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:10,587
Do not worry, Gino, do not worry. And
anyway, what is the purpose of going?

119
00:11:10,629 --> 00:11:14,758
For us to be killed by a gang
professional players?

120
00:11:14,758 --> 00:11:19,471
And as we went to
last Olympics, Harry?

121
00:11:19,471 --> 00:11:24,184
I say, shame we
9-0 to Italy.

122
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:28,313
Gino, you know?
I think I will not miss anything.

123
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:29,398
You know, Pee Wee?

124
00:11:29,398 --> 00:11:31,483
In my mind, should be a
privilege to represent your country

125
00:11:31,525 --> 00:11:34,611
No matter how difficult
circumstances.

126
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:39,741
How many here are veterans of the army?

127
00:11:39,783 --> 00:11:43,453
Sure, in my
opinion, the best football

128
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:47,082
that country is played
right here in St. Louis.

129
00:11:47,124 --> 00:11:50,210
And I ask you to represent
the colors of that country

130
00:11:50,252 --> 00:11:52,296
the biggest event in the world.

131
00:12:07,978 --> 00:12:10,022
- This one is right?
- Yes

132
00:12:12,107 --> 00:12:15,235
- Your mother wants to see you.
- What?

133
00:12:15,277 --> 00:12:17,321
His mother wants to see you.

134
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:20,449
It cleaned everything for the funeral.

135
00:12:23,577 --> 00:12:27,748
Your Uncle Joe told me you
is asking for 3 weeks out

136
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:31,960
- To go play your game this?
- Yes, I asked him, he said okay.

137
00:12:33,003 --> 00:12:36,632
Of course, he said. He
this is crazy for soccer.

138
00:12:36,632 --> 00:12:40,302
I told him that you will not.

139
00:12:40,344 --> 00:12:43,347
Embalming School
begins in three weeks.

140
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:47,518
- And you can not miss classes.
- School of embalming?

141
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:49,645
Mother, how many times I gotta tell you,

142
00:12:49,645 --> 00:12:51,730
I'm not going to
school of embalming?

143
00:12:51,772 --> 00:12:53,815
Just because you do not want.

144
00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:59,029
You do not want to improve your life?

145
00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:03,242
This is the family business, right here.

146
00:13:03,242 --> 00:13:06,370
We will not have this conversation,
not again.

147
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:12,626
Already a grown man and still
chasing these kids!

148
00:13:12,668 --> 00:13:15,754
- That children play!
- Frank?

149
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,883
I'm starting to get crazy.

150
00:13:20,926 --> 00:13:25,055
How many times do I have to tell her
that's not what I do?

151
00:13:25,097 --> 00:13:30,102
What is it, Frank, you know
she has good intentions.

152
00:13:30,102 --> 00:13:32,604
She just wants the best for you.

153
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:37,651
No, actually Mary, she
knows what is best for me.

154
00:13:42,865 --> 00:13:46,994
Let's get something to eat.

155
00:13:47,035 --> 00:13:50,163
Sorry love, I have
find the boys tonight.

156
00:13:50,205 --> 00:13:55,294
- I promise I'll be back soon.
- Okay.

157
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:59,840
Then you do it?
Will participate in testing?

158
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:08,390
Yes, I will.

159
00:14:08,432 --> 00:14:11,018
Do not be late.

160
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:23,447
Joe has to take that hit.

161
00:14:23,447 --> 00:14:25,616
Frank, you always had a
grip better than his.

162
00:14:25,657 --> 00:14:29,745
Thank you Mr. Pee Wee, but you
have not answered my question.

163
00:14:29,828 --> 00:14:34,917
- What question?
- Will you be there tomorrow?

164
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:36,376
I can not do that.

165
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:39,129
What are you talking about,
"Can not do that"?

166
00:14:39,129 --> 00:14:41,215
I can not do that.

167
00:14:41,215 --> 00:14:45,385
That makes no sense, Pee Wee.
You know you have to be part of it.

168
00:14:45,427 --> 00:14:47,471
We always play together.

169
00:14:47,513 --> 00:14:50,641
Not to mention that you love the game
more than anyone I know.

170
00:14:50,641 --> 00:14:51,683
That's it

171
00:14:52,726 --> 00:14:56,897
And you and Gino are a great team.

172
00:14:56,897 --> 00:15:01,068
Furthermore, we
would have so much fun.

173
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:05,197
Giesler said that we
have to fly to Brazil.

174
00:15:05,239 --> 00:15:07,241
- I can not do that.
- That's the problem?

175
00:15:07,282 --> 00:15:12,496
- I can not fly. - This is not a
problem. - Of course it's a problem.

176
00:15:12,538 --> 00:15:16,667
Ask God's protection,
and everything will be fine.

177
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:18,752
On the plane?

178
00:15:18,752 --> 00:15:22,965
Hear that?
We have two bases occupied.

179
00:15:23,173 --> 00:15:25,801
I understand, I understand, that's the plan.

180
00:15:26,093 --> 00:15:29,221
We were so drunk before
to get on that plane I

181
00:15:29,221 --> 00:15:32,349
I guarantee you will not even
realize that the trip happened.

182
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:34,935
What do you say?

183
00:15:35,477 --> 00:15:39,606
You know about me and
Frank small places.

184
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:47,865
Pee Wee, what happened
you 6 years ago?

185
00:15:51,118 --> 00:15:55,247
That time I spent
hospitalized because ...

186
00:15:55,289 --> 00:15:59,459
as they call it, the trauma of war?
How often do you think?

187
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:02,546
It feels really bad.

188
00:16:02,588 --> 00:16:07,676
Guys? Stan the Man will come.

189
00:16:10,929 --> 00:16:14,016
... And he catches the ball,
Wallace and go to ...

190
00:16:14,099 --> 00:16:15,058
Ok, that's the goal!

191
00:16:19,229 --> 00:16:21,315
Trying to kill me?

192
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:31,742
- Let's go to Randazzo.
- I can not, I see Janet.

193
00:16:31,783 --> 00:16:36,455
If you show up so soon
she'll throw your ass on the street.

194
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:41,168
Yes, Janet and what would you
would be a lot worse crap.

195
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:44,254
Yeah!

196
00:16:44,296 --> 00:16:48,383
- Did you just say "crap"?
- I think so.

197
00:16:48,425 --> 00:16:53,138
I must be drunk.

198
00:16:53,138 --> 00:16:57,768
If this keeps up
will say "shit" soon!

199
00:16:57,809 --> 00:16:59,895
Ok guys, let me
go have the test tomorrow.

200
00:16:59,895 --> 00:17:01,980
Let's drink to Randazzo.

201
00:17:02,022 --> 00:17:04,066
Tomorrow is the test, no, no.

202
00:17:09,321 --> 00:17:11,406
Are you okay?

203
00:17:19,748 --> 00:17:21,750
Hey Gino, what's the problem?

204
00:17:21,834 --> 00:17:28,048
I just wanted to be on the team.
I just wanted to be on the team.

205
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:29,091
I know.

206
00:17:32,219 --> 00:17:40,602
You are the best striker
world. It really is, Gino.

207
00:17:40,602 --> 00:17:44,648
And you will spend the rest
life with her, right?

208
00:17:48,944 --> 00:17:54,116
Everyone thinks you will be there,
punching bag on the team there.

209
00:17:54,199 --> 00:17:58,245
Nobody said it goes with the Pee Wee.

210
00:17:58,287 --> 00:18:04,751
No matter, Frankie does not matter,
I want to be on this team.

211
00:18:05,627 --> 00:18:09,756
- I know.
- I just want to be on the team.

212
00:18:30,611 --> 00:18:32,696
Sit, Sit!

213
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:37,910
I told you man, never appear later.
This is an insult.

214
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:41,038
I do not want my daughter treated
that way!

215
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:44,166
Sorry, Silvio.

216
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:47,294
In my house it is
considered an offense.

217
00:18:47,294 --> 00:18:48,879
Pee Wee said ...

218
00:18:48,879 --> 00:18:50,464
Stop talking about
Pee Wee, shut up!

219
00:18:50,464 --> 00:18:54,593
There are more things
important to talk about.

220
00:18:54,635 --> 00:18:59,848
Now I have a test for selection
United States Soccer tomorrow.

221
00:19:00,891 --> 00:19:02,935
I've told them that
could not participate.

222
00:19:02,976 --> 00:19:05,020
Mr. Walter Giesler
came to ask my help.

223
00:19:05,062 --> 00:19:09,191
- Mr. Giesler, he came here?
- You talk too much

224
00:19:09,233 --> 00:19:12,319
Just listen at least once.

225
00:19:12,361 --> 00:19:14,363
Mr. Geizler.

226
00:19:14,404 --> 00:19:18,575
He talked about the great honor
it would be for this family,

227
00:19:18,617 --> 00:19:22,746
to this community,
La Montagne, for this nation.

228
00:19:22,788 --> 00:19:26,959
If you wear the uniform
the United States.

229
00:19:26,959 --> 00:19:29,044
Do you agree with him?

230
00:19:33,215 --> 00:19:37,302
- I agree.
- Of course you agree, that's right!

231
00:19:37,344 --> 00:19:40,472
- But the Lord has a little problem ...
- There is no problem.

232
00:19:40,514 --> 00:19:42,516
You will be in the testing tomorrow.

233
00:19:42,558 --> 00:19:46,728
The team travels next Sunday and we
out a couple of weeks, so ...

234
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:48,814
Dad, just tell him.

235
00:19:49,857 --> 00:19:52,985
We've changed, you
married on Saturday.

236
00:19:53,026 --> 00:19:57,155
But the church, the church and the hall ...

237
00:19:57,155 --> 00:20:01,869
While you were out getting
drunk I was fixing everything.

238
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:06,582
- Except for the invitations.
- That you will do tomorrow after testing.

239
00:20:10,752 --> 00:20:12,796
Good enough for you?

240
00:20:15,924 --> 00:20:19,052
Do not do it again.
And there he goes again with tears.

241
00:20:19,094 --> 00:20:25,309
Never in my life
I saw a man cry so much.

242
00:20:30,522 --> 00:20:33,150
What you know about
these guys from the east coast, Frank?

243
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:35,360
A little.

244
00:20:35,777 --> 00:20:40,073
- I've played against some of them.
- Walter Bahr E?

245
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:50,292
He knows what he does.
And any one bag is good at it too.

246
00:20:50,334 --> 00:20:56,590
Pay attention to Clarkie Souza.
Phenomenal, a kind of magic with the ball.

247
00:20:56,632 --> 00:21:01,803
Well fast.
and Ed McIlvenny, Scotland.

248
00:21:01,845 --> 00:21:03,889
one of the best around.

249
00:21:07,017 --> 00:21:11,230
Then Pee Wee will appear?

250
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:13,273
I do not know.

251
00:21:13,315 --> 00:21:17,486
Okay, guys, we are not interested
in which team makes more goals.

252
00:21:17,528 --> 00:21:20,531
We look for individual play.

253
00:21:20,614 --> 00:21:22,658
And that means not
only what they do alone,

254
00:21:22,658 --> 00:21:24,743
but how to make your team better.

255
00:21:24,785 --> 00:21:27,829
This game will be refereed
like any other.

256
00:21:27,871 --> 00:21:33,043
If expelled, too
will be off the team.

257
00:21:33,085 --> 00:21:39,341
As you know the coach is Bill Jeffrey
selection. Bill has something to say?

258
00:21:40,384 --> 00:21:47,599
Remember, this is a game
gentlemen, then play as such.

259
00:21:48,767 --> 00:21:54,022
All right, gentlemen.
Let's start.

260
00:21:56,066 --> 00:21:59,152
I keep saying that
I do not get on that plane.

261
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:19,006
It was clear to anyone watching, that
Both teams had a very different style.

262
00:22:19,006 --> 00:22:25,554
The east coast played with discipline
and accuracy. A thin type of football.

263
00:22:26,346 --> 00:22:31,476
The team played St. Louis
more improvisation.

264
00:23:13,185 --> 00:23:16,313
Lift, son of Yale.

265
00:23:17,356 --> 00:23:20,484
I do not study at Yale,
his Neanderthal.

266
00:23:20,484 --> 00:23:24,655
Neanderthal? what is it?
I never studied at a college.

267
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:52,766
Good job.

268
00:23:52,808 --> 00:23:57,521
Jeffrey? I Dent McSkimming
I cover football for the St. Louis Post.

269
00:23:57,563 --> 00:24:02,192
You just said that the city
is a reporter for football only?

270
00:24:02,234 --> 00:24:05,863
I'm sure you heard how
this sport is important here?

271
00:24:05,904 --> 00:24:09,491
I thought it was Walter Giesler
just trying to impress me.

272
00:24:09,533 --> 00:24:13,704
The Italians are here in The Hill
organized soccer for over 45 years.

273
00:24:13,745 --> 00:24:16,748
I have seen and covered the sport across the country.

274
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:19,918
not the best place to
football players St. Louis.

275
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:24,047
Yes, but I have to disagree.

276
00:24:24,089 --> 00:24:28,218
Say the name of a better
goalkeeper Frank Borghi?

277
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:32,431
Did you see Pee Wee Wallace. anyone on the team
East compares to him as the attacker.

278
00:24:32,472 --> 00:24:36,643
- We were watching the same game?
- Charlie Colombo.

279
00:24:36,643 --> 00:24:39,730
Any team needs
a Charlie Colombo.

280
00:24:39,771 --> 00:24:44,985
Gino Parian, Harry Keough, Bob Annis.
They are all world class players.

281
00:24:46,028 --> 00:24:52,784
- Have a question for me, Mr. ..?
- McSkimming

282
00:24:53,285 --> 00:24:55,370
I hope not.

283
00:24:57,456 --> 00:25:02,628
Come on guys, no one
died, are just tests.

284
00:25:02,669 --> 00:25:06,089
I know it's only a test
but we will defeat them.

285
00:25:06,089 --> 00:25:09,468
They play like sissies

286
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:12,888
But Walter Bahr is strong
rather, it is not, Charlie?

287
00:25:12,888 --> 00:25:16,266
Who asked you to talk to me?

288
00:25:16,266 --> 00:25:20,437
Bahr is fooling himself,
as if doing a show here.

289
00:25:20,479 --> 00:25:23,482
I'm doing my best
to put him on a stretcher.

290
00:25:23,565 --> 00:25:28,695
Why do not you stop with that
crap? Kick the ball, not the guy.

291
00:25:28,737 --> 00:25:33,951
If you are kicked out of this team you
selection is not going to, you know that right?

292
00:25:33,992 --> 00:25:37,037
Pee Wee, what's wrong with you

293
00:25:37,079 --> 00:25:42,292
Is trying not to join the team?
Come on, put your head in the game!

294
00:25:42,334 --> 00:25:45,420
Gino, I want you and Pee
using each other

295
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:49,633
It's time for you
two work their magic.

296
00:26:04,189 --> 00:26:08,318
In the second half, the best
players on the field proved.

297
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:14,616
Pee Wee Wallace woke up at Gino
became a fatal combination ever.

298
00:26:26,128 --> 00:26:29,214
But that was an incentive for them

299
00:26:29,256 --> 00:26:33,427
Clarkie Sousa, Ed McIlvenny
and Walter Bahr.

300
00:26:57,409 --> 00:27:01,580
Do not do it.
We need him on the team.

301
00:27:03,665 --> 00:27:05,751
One more and he is out.

302
00:27:42,246 --> 00:27:45,332
That was good, but not so good.

303
00:27:49,503 --> 00:27:52,631
- I think he'll call me.
- Me too.

304
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:03,058
I do not like it there.

305
00:28:03,058 --> 00:28:05,185
Bahr thinks is
helping him to choose?

306
00:28:05,185 --> 00:28:07,271
Better not be.

307
00:28:12,484 --> 00:28:16,613
Hi Frank. Meet Walter, Walter Bahr?

308
00:28:16,655 --> 00:28:18,699
I was just wondering
if this guy was

309
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:20,784
helping you to make choices?

310
00:28:20,826 --> 00:28:23,871
Yes, we hear his opinions.

311
00:28:23,912 --> 00:28:29,126
- Well, if I would mind too?
- Yes, I care.

312
00:28:29,168 --> 00:28:33,297
Okay, leaving the two here.
I'll let you know.

313
00:28:37,467 --> 00:28:40,637
And when they heard the
boys from St. Louis had

314
00:28:40,637 --> 00:28:43,765
something to celebrate besides
Gino's wedding.

315
00:28:43,765 --> 00:28:46,894
Frank, Harry, Gloves, Pee Wee
and Gino joined the team.

316
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:59,364
Let's get outta here baby!

317
00:29:07,623 --> 00:29:09,791
Put me down!

318
00:29:13,045 --> 00:29:16,173
- I have something for you!
- For me?

319
00:29:16,298 --> 00:29:18,383
Congratulations.

320
00:29:22,346 --> 00:29:26,517
Charlie, What is he doing?

321
00:29:26,558 --> 00:29:30,646
- Thank you.
- Get out of here.

322
00:29:31,688 --> 00:29:34,816
Everyone please dance with us.

323
00:29:47,329 --> 00:29:50,499
Congratulations on the team.

324
00:29:56,755 --> 00:29:59,883
- Pee Wee, come here.
- Ok Mr. Abruzzo.

325
00:29:59,925 --> 00:30:01,969
Congratulations Pee Wee.

326
00:30:05,055 --> 00:30:10,269
It's very exciting to be chosen
for the team and go to Brazil?

327
00:30:13,397 --> 00:30:18,610
Sit down here, Frank.
Excuse us for a second, ok, Fiora?

328
00:30:18,652 --> 00:30:22,781
- Even more Pee Wee.
- Bye Fiora

329
00:30:24,908 --> 00:30:29,079
- Monte Christo.
- Oh Mr. Abruzzo, thank you

330
00:30:34,293 --> 00:30:38,422
Being chosen for the
U.S. team.

331
00:30:38,505 --> 00:30:40,507
A great honor.

332
00:30:56,148 --> 00:31:00,319
Want to know why football
is the greatest game in the world?

333
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:05,574
I'll tell you. Because everything you
need is a ball and an open place.

334
00:31:05,574 --> 00:31:08,702
Do not need any
equipment or special courts.

335
00:31:08,744 --> 00:31:12,789
You need not be
big, strong or high.

336
00:31:12,831 --> 00:31:19,087
It is the most democratic of all sports.
The people's game.

337
00:31:19,129 --> 00:31:25,344
The game of his people.
And the game of the future of the United States.

338
00:31:26,386 --> 00:31:30,557
So when I congratulate him
join the team for the United States,

339
00:31:30,599 --> 00:31:32,643
I see the look on his face,

340
00:31:32,643 --> 00:31:35,812
as if he had been elected
President of the United States.

341
00:31:35,812 --> 00:31:40,984
And not what I just saw.

342
00:31:41,026 --> 00:31:45,197
Now get out of here and
let me finish my game of cards.

343
00:31:51,411 --> 00:31:53,497
Until you proud to be one of

344
00:31:53,497 --> 00:31:55,582
best players
United States Soccer,

345
00:31:55,624 --> 00:31:59,711
You do not deserve one of these.

346
00:31:59,753 --> 00:32:02,881
Fiora Hey, come on, let's finish the game.

347
00:32:12,307 --> 00:32:15,435
St. Kitts for a safe journey.

348
00:32:23,735 --> 00:32:25,821
It's beautiful.

349
00:32:28,949 --> 00:32:32,077
Thanks, Dad

350
00:32:34,162 --> 00:32:37,291
But do not bother ...

351
00:32:38,333 --> 00:32:41,461
Janet I have to go, gotta go
Until more.

352
00:32:42,504 --> 00:32:46,717
Take care of it! okay?

353
00:32:49,845 --> 00:32:54,016
- Janet, I love you!
- I love you too.

354
00:32:57,102 --> 00:33:02,274
I will go to Guadalajara,
and wait until I say yes.

355
00:33:02,316 --> 00:33:06,486
Better not do that,
my father will kill you

356
00:33:06,486 --> 00:33:10,657
go up there looking for me.
He protects me too.

357
00:33:11,742 --> 00:33:16,914
So die fighting
for something I believe.

358
00:33:22,169 --> 00:33:27,341
- I will miss you.
- Me too.

359
00:33:27,382 --> 00:33:29,968
I'll be back before you know it.

360
00:33:29,968 --> 00:33:32,554
Frank, I'm really
proud of you.

361
00:33:32,638 --> 00:33:34,640
- I love you.
- I love you too.

362
00:33:34,681 --> 00:33:36,725
Gotta go.

363
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:08,006
- Hey, Frank, we are on track?
- We're almost there.

364
00:34:13,262 --> 00:34:15,305
This is it. Broadway Hotel.

365
00:34:27,818 --> 00:34:30,988
- What's your problem buddy?
- How do you know my name?

366
00:34:30,988 --> 00:34:35,158
- How should I know what is his name.
- Joe, Joe Maca.

367
00:34:35,158 --> 00:34:38,287
So what?

368
00:34:39,329 --> 00:34:43,417
You must be the guys
Italian St. Louis, right?

369
00:34:43,458 --> 00:34:45,210
Yes, we are.

370
00:34:45,711 --> 00:34:49,214
Well, welcome
the Plaza, guys.

371
00:34:52,843 --> 00:34:53,844
I am hungry.

372
00:34:53,886 --> 00:34:57,014
Let's eat Italian food
in honor of my Italian friends

373
00:34:57,055 --> 00:35:02,269
It can be a great pizza.
Jews are boys.

374
00:35:02,269 --> 00:35:06,315
- Who's coming?
- I do not know, I have no idea.

375
00:35:09,568 --> 00:35:13,739
- Belo Jew, Frank.
- What will you cook in the hotel?

376
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:17,910
- Not too bad.
- It's good.

377
00:35:17,951 --> 00:35:21,997
Look at them there, how are guys?

378
00:35:22,039 --> 00:35:28,295
- How was your trip?
- The boys from St. Louis.

379
00:35:28,337 --> 00:35:31,423
What happens here?

380
00:35:31,423 --> 00:35:33,509
You remember
Clarkie Souza, is not it?

381
00:35:33,509 --> 00:35:35,594
He dribbled around
you on Saturday.

382
00:35:35,636 --> 00:35:38,722
How are you?

383
00:35:38,764 --> 00:35:42,935
And this is Ed Souza.
Believe it or not, are not related.

384
00:35:42,935 --> 00:35:46,021
Who works here?

385
00:35:46,063 --> 00:35:52,236
I am with your keys and your tasks.

386
00:35:52,319 --> 00:35:55,948
Hey Gloves, which says
take a bath, we

387
00:35:55,948 --> 00:35:59,535
Toots Shors and to the left
Joe Di Maggio.

388
00:35:59,576 --> 00:36:02,704
Tomorrow at 9:00 will be the
training. And the next day

389
00:36:02,704 --> 00:36:05,832
play with a team
semiprofessional here in NY.

390
00:36:05,874 --> 00:36:10,003
So if you,
sleep the rest of the night.

391
00:36:10,003 --> 00:36:14,216
That's pretty funny, because
you and I'm not leaving.

392
00:36:14,216 --> 00:36:19,388
The training will have at least 3 hours

393
00:36:19,429 --> 00:36:22,558
We have about a
week to hit this time.

394
00:36:22,599 --> 00:36:25,644
Oh, you're willing to teach us?

395
00:36:25,686 --> 00:36:29,314
I am organizing
workouts, and while

396
00:36:29,314 --> 00:36:32,943
Mr. Jeffrey is
I will give out the training.

397
00:36:32,985 --> 00:36:36,029
- Is there a problem with that?
- Yes, I have purpose.

398
00:36:36,071 --> 00:36:39,199
Frank was here at all times in
I have been if he tells me to do something

399
00:36:39,241 --> 00:36:42,327
I do, but I do not hear from you.

400
00:36:42,452 --> 00:36:44,538
none of us will

401
00:36:45,455 --> 00:36:48,584
Okay, give the list to Frank.

402
00:36:48,625 --> 00:36:52,254
By the way, I do not like
taking orders from a Kraut.

403
00:36:58,010 --> 00:37:03,182
Yes I am of German descent,
and foremost I am American.

404
00:37:03,265 --> 00:37:07,352
Okay, enough.

405
00:37:08,395 --> 00:37:13,609
Tell me Wallace, you are a
or an American?

406
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:17,779
- Come on, Walter.
- Go to hell.

407
00:37:19,865 --> 00:37:25,120
Let's get some drinks,
who comes to me?

408
00:37:34,505 --> 00:37:38,634
The first training match against the team

409
00:37:38,675 --> 00:37:42,804
the semi-
Brooklyn was a disaster.

410
00:37:42,846 --> 00:37:45,891
The right foot did not know what the
left foot was doing.

411
00:37:45,933 --> 00:37:48,560
There was an evident difference
styles of boys

412
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:51,146
East Coast and
boys from St. Louis.

413
00:37:51,188 --> 00:37:57,444
But no joke, it seemed impossible
fix the major problems

414
00:38:04,743 --> 00:38:06,828
Pee Wee what is
doing? It was his face,

415
00:38:06,828 --> 00:38:08,914
your job, what are you doing?

416
00:38:08,956 --> 00:38:13,043
My work, what do you mean?
're running the whole field

417
00:38:13,126 --> 00:38:16,171
that guy over there because their
can not hold the ball.

418
00:38:16,213 --> 00:38:19,258
Pee and I have played with
long time for this.

419
00:38:19,299 --> 00:38:22,427
The guy can not hold college
the ball for more than a second and a half.

420
00:38:22,469 --> 00:38:28,684
Okay! is it folks! Good game,
Thank you gentlemen. That's enough.

421
00:38:32,896 --> 00:38:34,940
What the hell is happening?

422
00:38:34,982 --> 00:38:39,152
- He finished the game?
- What did you do?

423
00:38:42,281 --> 00:38:46,451
- Not going anywhere like this.
- They are the best available.

424
00:38:46,493 --> 00:38:49,538
Maybe for one game
Sunday in North Hampton.

425
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:51,623
We need someone
as Joe Gaetjens.

426
00:38:51,665 --> 00:38:54,710
Gaetjens, this is not possible.

427
00:38:54,751 --> 00:38:57,379
I thought it was about getting
top players

428
00:38:57,379 --> 00:38:59,965
the country to be the
more competitive as possible.

429
00:39:00,007 --> 00:39:03,135
Walter, we have 10
days to train together,

430
00:39:03,135 --> 00:39:06,263
before we play against teams

431
00:39:06,263 --> 00:39:11,435
who live and play together 365 days a year.

432
00:39:11,476 --> 00:39:13,562
The United States does not
be competitive

433
00:39:13,562 --> 00:39:15,647
World Cup
in the next 50 years.

434
00:39:15,939 --> 00:39:16,982
Our work ...

435
00:39:18,442 --> 00:39:21,486
Our job is to attend

436
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:24,281
and act as good ambassadors.

437
00:39:26,074 --> 00:39:29,161
All I care is
get the best team on the field.

438
00:39:30,204 --> 00:39:34,374
- I really need Gaetjens.
- It will not happen.

439
00:39:35,417 --> 00:39:37,503
Come on.

440
00:39:40,631 --> 00:39:42,716
What's happening?

441
00:39:42,758 --> 00:39:47,971
We will make this team better.
You want to play to win. right?

442
00:39:47,971 --> 00:39:52,142
Yeah, but you could have
finished the game first.

443
00:40:07,741 --> 00:40:10,869
- Joe Gaetjens!
- Yes?

444
00:40:10,869 --> 00:40:15,582
Walter Bahr, Frank Borghi is this.

445
00:40:15,624 --> 00:40:20,254
I know you. Wanting a rematch?

446
00:40:20,295 --> 00:40:24,466
You never know. By the way, come
request to join our team.

447
00:40:24,508 --> 00:40:26,510
What time is it?

448
00:40:26,552 --> 00:40:29,638
The selection of the United States
for the World Cup.

449
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:33,767
- And there's this team?.
- Has been organized very quickly.

450
00:40:33,809 --> 00:40:36,937
That's why we need you,
you adapt to any style of play.

451
00:40:36,979 --> 00:40:42,109
Yes, but what your style of play?

452
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:46,321
We do not have a style of play.
But we're working on it.

453
00:40:52,619 --> 00:40:56,790
I love America, then
I'm inside. Where do I start?

454
00:40:56,790 --> 00:40:58,834
Tomorrow morning, 6:30.

455
00:40:58,876 --> 00:41:03,046
We are playing in the field Werthman
in Long Island City.

456
00:41:03,088 --> 00:41:08,218
- We are going to Brazil in 6 days.
- In Brazil?

457
00:41:12,389 --> 00:41:15,475
One problem, my work.

458
00:41:15,517 --> 00:41:21,773
You-.. we will receive $ 100
per week, plus $ 5 supply.

459
00:41:21,815 --> 00:41:24,276
- Really?
- I'm in!

460
00:41:35,370 --> 00:41:41,585
- Nice to meet you Joe.
- Brazil!

461
00:41:45,756 --> 00:41:50,969
- This is a strange guy.
- Yes it is, but it is a phenomenal athlete.

462
00:41:51,011 --> 00:41:56,183
I saw him playing and Eddie Sousa

463
00:41:56,183 --> 00:42:00,354
You really think he
will be enough to make a difference?

464
00:42:00,395 --> 00:42:04,024
Frank, I need to believe
that this team is good.

465
00:42:04,024 --> 00:42:07,694
I need them to believe
also, they listen to you.

466
00:42:07,736 --> 00:42:09,780
I see players
we have now and see

467
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:11,865
a team with which to
difficult to play against.

468
00:42:11,907 --> 00:42:14,910
We will surprise
people that way, Frank.

469
00:42:14,993 --> 00:42:19,122
So you really think we can
go to Brazil, and in fact, win a game?

470
00:42:19,164 --> 00:42:21,166
Yes, yes, I think.

471
00:42:21,208 --> 00:42:25,379
Never set foot in a field if I did not think
that my team could win, ever.

472
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:29,550
And I bet you never thought that the goal
any team would score on you right?.

473
00:42:29,591 --> 00:42:32,678
No, but I was not playing
against the best teams in the world.

474
00:42:32,719 --> 00:42:36,890
This has to do with believing.
Always so.

475
00:42:38,976 --> 00:42:42,062
Let me ask you something?

476
00:42:42,104 --> 00:42:45,232
Why did you want me to come with
you to call this guy, Joe?

477
00:42:45,232 --> 00:42:48,360
You could have done it alone.

478
00:42:48,402 --> 00:42:51,405
Why can not I do it myself,
need your support.

479
00:42:51,446 --> 00:42:54,575
You saw how those guys are

480
00:42:54,575 --> 00:42:57,703
need you to help me
to put this team together.

481
00:43:01,874 --> 00:43:06,044
You really believe that.

482
00:43:06,044 --> 00:43:11,258
I assume that everyone here has
heard the name Stanley Mortenson.

483
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:14,928
Stanley Mortenson, an undeniably

484
00:43:14,928 --> 00:43:18,599
of the best players
the last 50 years.

485
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:22,227
He is currently
on a U.S. tour

486
00:43:22,227 --> 00:43:25,856
and Canada with a team
choice of aces

487
00:43:25,939 --> 00:43:28,984
with the best players
English first division.

488
00:43:29,026 --> 00:43:34,198
And they agreed to
play with us tomorrow.

489
00:43:38,368 --> 00:43:41,496
Right here.

490
00:43:41,496 --> 00:43:43,790
Excuse me, when
we get our uniforms?

491
00:43:43,790 --> 00:43:44,625
I'm working on it.

492
00:43:44,666 --> 00:43:48,837
Remember, your
Passports have to be

493
00:43:48,837 --> 00:43:53,008
in the hands of up to 12
later on Wednesday.

494
00:43:53,050 --> 00:43:57,179
The flight will be in
Friday, midnight.

495
00:43:57,179 --> 00:44:01,308
You will all be
outside the hotel at 10:00.

496
00:44:01,391 --> 00:44:04,394
What are they doing here?

497
00:44:04,436 --> 00:44:09,608
Coach ... that guy Wellfit,
whatever it was his name.

498
00:44:09,650 --> 00:44:13,820
Not well, got sick and had to
go home and asked me to tell you.

499
00:44:13,862 --> 00:44:17,991
- Because he did not tell me?
- Okay, let's play!

500
00:44:19,576 --> 00:44:20,619
Frank?

501
00:44:21,161 --> 00:44:23,247
Do not ask me
Coach, I do not know.

502
00:44:46,144 --> 00:44:49,273
Who is this?

503
00:45:01,827 --> 00:45:05,956
Hey, are you Catholic?

504
00:45:05,998 --> 00:45:11,170
I'm not no, but I'm very
respect for the faith. much respect

505
00:45:21,597 --> 00:45:25,767
Listen I was thinking, if we continue
playing more compact will work.

506
00:45:25,809 --> 00:45:29,855
- I do not agree.
- Hey, calm down! Calm down!

507
00:45:36,236 --> 00:45:38,322
The problem is that we are
killing on counter-attacks.

508
00:45:38,322 --> 00:45:40,407
It is not our ability
is our training.

509
00:45:40,449 --> 00:45:43,452
All going forward,
and no one on the side.

510
00:45:43,535 --> 00:45:47,623
Then they go through is what we
a training need is, stability.

511
00:45:47,664 --> 00:45:53,420
There will be four guys back, four in the middle and
you in front with Joe Gaetjens there.

512
00:45:53,462 --> 00:45:59,134
- You can not score with that formation.
- We have to start thinking about defense.

513
00:45:59,134 --> 00:46:01,220
It is a defense against their attackers.

514
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:03,347
You will not make the record
goals in a World Cup.

515
00:46:03,347 --> 00:46:05,432
Listen to Walter, the problem is that we have

516
00:46:05,432 --> 00:46:07,518
played in a training
throughout our lives.

517
00:46:07,518 --> 00:46:11,647
Changing this could be a disaster,
let's just play!

518
00:46:11,688 --> 00:46:16,902
Wait! Just doing a
suggestion, a suggestion urgent

519
00:46:16,944 --> 00:46:19,988
But if you want to be
humiliated in Brazil is well.

520
00:46:20,072 --> 00:46:24,117
He's right.
Yes he's right.

521
00:46:24,159 --> 00:46:26,662
We played like a bunch of crap.

522
00:46:26,995 --> 00:46:31,375
I say, not without the ball
know where to go.

523
00:46:33,335 --> 00:46:36,380
Like a leaf is
swept downstream.

524
00:46:36,713 --> 00:46:45,055
- Walter, we need this training.
- I agree with Joe.

525
00:46:45,055 --> 00:46:50,227
Wait!

526
00:46:50,269 --> 00:46:52,354
Frank, what do you think?

527
00:46:56,483 --> 00:47:00,654
Why not use the first time?

528
00:47:00,696 --> 00:47:04,825
If not we can switch.

529
00:47:04,867 --> 00:47:05,826
Good

530
00:47:05,868 --> 00:47:08,996
Sure, it's good for everyone?

531
00:47:14,251 --> 00:47:17,379
Stay tuned!

532
00:47:29,850 --> 00:47:33,979
Well there is one
greatest players of this century.

533
00:47:34,021 --> 00:47:39,234
You will be able to tell your grandchildren
who played against Stanley Mortenson.

534
00:47:39,276 --> 00:47:42,362
Not if he scored against me.

535
00:47:44,448 --> 00:47:49,661
The way I understand, it's just a player
trying to make me look bad.

536
00:47:49,703 --> 00:47:53,332
He is so agile, so flows
easy, you do not even notice

537
00:47:53,332 --> 00:47:57,002
how fast he is until he shows.

538
00:47:57,044 --> 00:48:00,088
What you got for me?

539
00:48:00,130 --> 00:48:06,345
Do not believe it goes right,
because it goes left.

540
00:48:07,387 --> 00:48:10,474
There is a problem with the English,

541
00:48:10,516 --> 00:48:14,186
They think that just because
invented this game

542
00:48:14,186 --> 00:48:17,814
they have a divine destiny
to be the best.

543
00:48:17,856 --> 00:48:21,985
Why do you think I'm on your side?

544
00:48:58,522 --> 00:49:01,608
Jeffrey?

545
00:49:01,650 --> 00:49:05,279
- When we receive the uniforms?
- I'm working on it.

546
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:08,949
We flew to Brazil in two days.
They will be ready by then?

547
00:49:08,991 --> 00:49:11,034
I hope so.

548
00:49:14,121 --> 00:49:16,206
Jeffrey knows, it is
difficult to make other

549
00:49:16,206 --> 00:49:18,292
teams to take us
seriously the way it is,

550
00:49:18,417 --> 00:49:21,962
even if we appear
a bunch of clowns.

551
00:49:21,962 --> 00:49:25,507
We will have no chance.

552
00:49:32,931 --> 00:49:35,017
Clarkie, you're the guy
faster than we have.

553
00:49:35,017 --> 00:49:37,102
Stan Mortenson stick in the whole game.

554
00:49:37,102 --> 00:49:41,273
Do not let him get the ball, do not let
he does, do not let him do anything.

555
00:49:41,315 --> 00:49:44,401
do us all a favor take
these guys from their faces.

556
00:49:44,443 --> 00:49:49,573
Gaetjens, help in the midfield ok?

557
00:49:49,698 --> 00:49:54,786
Guys, this is a great game
for everyone. We can do it.

558
00:50:28,153 --> 00:50:34,409
The Americans began to
new line of defense and energy.

559
00:50:34,535 --> 00:50:40,791
But after they hold at the beginning of
first time, the ground started to open.

560
00:51:30,757 --> 00:51:34,386
The English, as a whole, with
exception of Stanley Mortenson

561
00:51:34,386 --> 00:51:38,015
failed to make your team,
I was going to the World Cup,

562
00:51:38,056 --> 00:51:40,142
gain control of the game.

563
00:51:40,225 --> 00:51:45,314
But they easily show the
weaknesses of the American team.

564
00:52:11,381 --> 00:52:16,094
Stanley Mortenson was no doubt
the best player on the field.

565
00:52:16,136 --> 00:52:20,766
And after a while they started
playing with great confidence.

566
00:52:20,766 --> 00:52:23,894
Almost contemptuously, as if they knew

567
00:52:23,894 --> 00:52:27,064
that Americans do not
were scored against them.

568
00:52:35,405 --> 00:52:39,576
"Shall not be permitted
language 'profane' in some hours. "

569
00:52:44,748 --> 00:52:49,461
Okay, you guys head
up, you are playing well!

570
00:52:49,503 --> 00:52:53,382
We still have 45 minutes and you
are already thinking about going home.

571
00:52:53,423 --> 00:52:57,261
We go to the World Cup.
We're only losing 2-0.

572
00:52:57,302 --> 00:53:00,389
Only two? only two?
"Defense, defense, defense!"

573
00:53:00,430 --> 00:53:03,517
We can not score goals,
we can not win!.

574
00:53:03,559 --> 00:53:05,102
I like that, by
least is talking about

575
00:53:05,102 --> 00:53:06,687
win, everyone will win, we win!

576
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:09,273
- Somebody tell him that not
I care what he likes.

577
00:53:09,398 --> 00:53:15,028
He's right, while we think it
played the 2nd time, they laugh at us.

578
00:53:15,070 --> 00:53:18,073
You know, it's time to defend.

579
00:53:18,115 --> 00:53:21,243
We took the ball and hold on the
we can not let them score.

580
00:53:21,285 --> 00:53:23,287
So let's go attack
and then won the game.

581
00:53:23,328 --> 00:53:27,499
Gentlemen, are doing well,
but remember,

582
00:53:27,499 --> 00:53:31,670
Lunch tomorrow
12:00 Adolf in Astoria.

583
00:53:31,712 --> 00:53:33,755
Suit and tie.

584
00:53:33,755 --> 00:53:36,383
Officials of FIFA and
American Fed will

585
00:53:36,383 --> 00:53:39,011
be present in the same
so that all of you.

586
00:53:39,011 --> 00:53:42,139
Now, anyone
does not appear to be

587
00:53:42,139 --> 00:53:45,267
off the team, there will be
excuses or exceptions.

588
00:53:49,438 --> 00:53:52,524
Now, to continue what they were doing.

589
00:54:21,762 --> 00:54:24,806
The Americans returned
to his old defense training

590
00:54:24,890 --> 00:54:27,976
trying to prevent more goals to take.
But it was not working.

591
00:54:28,018 --> 00:54:32,147
They seemed to err in
every aspect of the game.

592
00:56:39,399 --> 00:56:42,528
It's a long walk to the hotel, Frank.

593
00:56:43,570 --> 00:56:48,742
I was horrible, they should not
have scored as many goals against me.

594
00:56:48,784 --> 00:56:51,828
It was a failure of the team,
you did not have chances.

595
00:56:51,870 --> 00:56:54,957
It is not the fault of the team, that's my
Walter goal, it is my responsibility!

596
00:56:54,998 --> 00:56:58,126
I am the last line of defense when
score a goal, they score against me.

597
00:56:58,168 --> 00:57:02,297
I who have to catch
the ball in the back of the net.

598
00:57:02,297 --> 00:57:06,510
Perhaps we have made it look easy
tonight, after all none of the players

599
00:57:06,510 --> 00:57:09,638
them is good enough to
go to the England squad,

600
00:57:09,638 --> 00:57:11,932
against whom we
play in a week.

601
00:57:55,475 --> 00:58:00,689
Gentlemen, we are grateful for
honor us with your presence today.

602
00:58:04,860 --> 00:58:07,988
You have made a great contribution,

603
00:58:07,988 --> 00:58:11,658
Welcome to the North American continent and

604
00:58:11,658 --> 00:58:15,329
demonstrating the high
English tradition in football.

605
00:58:15,329 --> 00:58:18,999
England, as we all know,

606
00:58:19,041 --> 00:58:21,251
will be our great game.

607
00:58:21,877 --> 00:58:22,961
They were designed,

608
00:58:24,755 --> 00:58:28,759
incubated, and has
are developed.

609
00:58:29,426 --> 00:58:34,056
- What did he say?
- What matters?

610
00:58:34,181 --> 00:58:36,266
There's a player
even that did not feel

611
00:58:36,266 --> 00:58:38,352
honored to be in
field with you yesterday.

612
00:58:39,269 --> 00:58:43,440
I thank you wholeheartedly.

613
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:46,568
Hey guys, I think our coach
want to go home with the British.

614
00:58:46,610 --> 00:58:51,782
You know what? they can take it.

615
00:58:51,823 --> 00:58:53,200
Pee Wee, take it easy.

616
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:55,994
You also take it easy,
two for the price of one.

617
00:59:05,337 --> 00:59:09,466
Frank, ensure that it enters
on the plane tomorrow night.

618
00:59:09,508 --> 00:59:14,721
I do not think that talking is enough,
we have to bring it down somehow.

619
00:59:19,935 --> 00:59:26,191
Hey, where is it?

620
00:59:26,233 --> 00:59:31,446
Hey, Voodoo, have someone talking to you.

621
00:59:31,488 --> 00:59:36,618
can we get some "miki"?

622
00:59:36,660 --> 00:59:41,331
Miki? I get a little with the
guy who is making my passport.

623
00:59:41,331 --> 00:59:44,501
What do you mean by
"Doing your passport?"

624
00:59:44,501 --> 00:59:46,003
I need one, right?

625
00:59:46,044 --> 00:59:48,046
- Yes, you do not already have one?
- No

626
00:59:48,088 --> 00:59:53,302
- You are not naturalized?
- No, I have a student visa.

627
00:59:53,343 --> 00:59:56,430
Learning to be a dishwasher?

628
00:59:56,471 --> 01:00:00,601
No, a degree in accounting.

629
01:00:00,642 --> 01:00:03,562
You've been here enough
to be naturalized, right?

630
01:00:03,770 --> 01:00:04,730
Yes, but ...

631
01:00:04,855 --> 01:00:07,316
It is enough to
me, and for all, right?

632
01:00:07,983 --> 01:00:14,114
Now a few words
a remarkable man.

633
01:00:14,156 --> 01:00:22,456
Last year, the final
FA Cup, scored three goals.

634
01:00:22,497 --> 01:00:25,125
A great player, a great man, a

635
01:00:25,125 --> 01:00:29,838
Hero of Our Time,
Mr. Stanley Mortenson.

636
01:00:42,351 --> 01:00:45,979
The challenge of victory is
close to all our hearts,

637
01:00:45,979 --> 01:00:49,608
this is why
all we are here.

638
01:00:49,691 --> 01:00:52,778
And these competitions
in international show

639
01:00:52,778 --> 01:00:55,864
our similarities
and our differences,

640
01:00:55,906 --> 01:01:01,620
the desire to win at any cost and
the will to pursue these dreams.

641
01:01:01,662 --> 01:01:07,376
England is not fascinated, for example,
with baseball. We love cricket.

642
01:01:07,376 --> 01:01:10,462
That fits best
with our national character.

643
01:01:10,504 --> 01:01:13,632
Just as
do with football,

644
01:01:13,632 --> 01:01:16,760
appears as a single line
be the best way to attack

645
01:01:16,802 --> 01:01:20,389
Our football fits our
temper the same way.

646
01:01:20,430 --> 01:01:23,976
It is a sport of intellect as it
as athletic ability

647
01:01:24,017 --> 01:01:30,274
A sport with strategy, where
predict your opponent is so important

648
01:01:30,315 --> 01:01:33,360
as running more and score more goals.

649
01:01:33,402 --> 01:01:38,615
The soccer as you call them,
is in its infancy in North America.

650
01:01:38,657 --> 01:01:42,828
And take some time to
reach the level of other countries

651
01:01:42,828 --> 01:01:49,084
where football is a
matter of life or death

652
01:01:49,126 --> 01:01:55,299
But I wish the U.S. team
American lucky

653
01:01:55,340 --> 01:01:59,469
and after England take you
for school football

654
01:01:59,511 --> 01:02:05,726
have a nice vacation in Brazil.

655
01:02:05,767 --> 01:02:08,854
Health

656
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:21,366
This guy just say "vacation"?

657
01:02:21,408 --> 01:02:24,536
- He has more or less this time.
- Do you know where he was?

658
01:02:24,578 --> 01:02:26,580
- We do not know anything.
- He is not in the back.

659
01:02:26,622 --> 01:02:30,792
Gloves, Charlie get off the phone.
Have you seen him? found anywhere?

660
01:02:30,834 --> 01:02:33,837
No sign.

661
01:02:33,879 --> 01:02:39,092
- I found him, he is on the roof.
- I take it, you take his stuff.

662
01:02:39,134 --> 01:02:41,136
The bus leaves in 15 minutes.

663
01:02:41,178 --> 01:02:44,264
- You put my stuff on the bus?
- Yes

664
01:02:44,306 --> 01:02:48,477
Gloves! Make sure that
buses do not leave without us.

665
01:02:57,903 --> 01:03:02,074
We have guards at all exits,
can not escape.

666
01:03:04,159 --> 01:03:10,374
So Joe Maca walking there in that alley
has to do with me not flying for the World Cup?

667
01:03:10,415 --> 01:03:13,502
I guess you know very well.

668
01:03:17,673 --> 01:03:20,801
The closer we come,
least makes sense

669
01:03:20,801 --> 01:03:22,886
Why do we have to go
so go there and have

670
01:03:22,886 --> 01:03:24,972
a bunch of murdering the British?

671
01:03:25,013 --> 01:03:28,141
Frank, what's the purpose?

672
01:03:42,698 --> 01:03:48,912
This will help you relax.

673
01:03:48,954 --> 01:03:52,082
- This will not do well for my stomach.
- Drink a sip, Pee Wee.

674
01:03:52,124 --> 01:03:56,253
- I'm not thirsty.
- Drink now!

675
01:04:00,424 --> 01:04:02,801
You put something here, Frank?

676
01:04:04,428 --> 01:04:07,431
No, it's a business voodoo.

677
01:04:08,807 --> 01:04:12,978
And why do not you say so?

678
01:04:52,559 --> 01:04:54,603
What are you doing Joe?

679
01:04:54,645 --> 01:05:00,859
I am in contact with
my spirit guide

680
01:05:00,901 --> 01:05:07,157
- Voodoo Thing.
- Why do I bother?

681
01:05:07,199 --> 01:05:11,328
It bothers me because it is sacrilege

682
01:05:11,370 --> 01:05:16,583
Sacrilege means something
detracts from their religion,

683
01:05:17,626 --> 01:05:20,337
and what I'm doing is
exactly the opposite.

684
01:05:21,839 --> 01:05:26,927
I do not see Joe as well,
not believe it.

685
01:05:26,969 --> 01:05:31,139
Why do not you
respect my beliefs?

686
01:05:31,139 --> 01:05:35,310
They are real to me and
millions of people in my country.

687
01:05:35,352 --> 01:05:41,567
It's our way of cultural
understand what we see.

688
01:05:41,608 --> 01:05:44,695
Powerful forces that guide our lives

689
01:05:44,695 --> 01:05:49,950
I feel very connected with my
world when I am in contact with it.

690
01:05:54,121 --> 01:05:57,207
What you say is be sacrilege

691
01:05:57,249 --> 01:06:01,920
something that says that there is
no power in what you believe

692
01:06:01,962 --> 01:06:06,550
We are together here because
we are good at what they love

693
01:06:06,592 --> 01:06:09,219
And whoever or
it is that put

694
01:06:09,219 --> 01:06:11,805
the ball in the back of the net,
not matter to me.

695
01:06:23,317 --> 01:06:25,903
Ladies and Gentlemen,
here is Captain Da Silva.

696
01:06:25,903 --> 01:06:28,530
We are going through
strong turbulence.

697
01:06:28,572 --> 01:06:30,616
Please keep
tightened their belts.

698
01:06:30,616 --> 01:06:32,701
We go through it in 30 minutes.

699
01:06:32,743 --> 01:06:34,786
Thank you.

700
01:07:01,897 --> 01:07:06,026
Where are we?

701
01:07:06,068 --> 01:07:09,696
In a large crater in the ground.

702
01:07:09,696 --> 01:07:13,325
Oh, great, into the ground.

703
01:07:59,204 --> 01:08:02,332
Look at this hotel!

704
01:09:05,938 --> 01:09:10,651
We have bets, England
is favored, 3 to 1.

705
01:09:10,692 --> 01:09:15,322
Brazil 4 to 1, Italy 1 to 6,
Spain, 8 to 1.

706
01:09:15,364 --> 01:09:20,035
The only team that is not even
we are listed, the United States.

707
01:09:20,077 --> 01:09:24,706
- As if we did not exist, right?
- As someone not even bet on us?

708
01:09:24,748 --> 01:09:27,334
There are bets for all
games of the first phase,

709
01:09:27,334 --> 01:09:29,920
except for our game with England.

710
01:09:30,003 --> 01:09:34,091
That's disrespectful.

711
01:09:51,859 --> 01:09:56,029
I'm sorry gentlemen,
got lost somewhere.

712
01:09:56,071 --> 01:10:00,158
I apologize for not being
with you in New York

713
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:03,245
There were many preparations
I had to take care here.

714
01:10:03,328 --> 01:10:08,458
No need to apologize, at least in
put in class hotels.

715
01:10:08,500 --> 01:10:12,671
- I also apologize for that Charlie.
- And the uniforms, what we wear?

716
01:10:12,713 --> 01:10:14,715
Are being provided, I'm sure.

717
01:10:14,756 --> 01:10:18,927
You are promising that the last two
week and is already in the last minute.

718
01:10:18,927 --> 01:10:22,055
Mr. Parian, is the ability
player and not the

719
01:10:22,055 --> 01:10:25,184
splendor of its
clothing that matter.

720
01:10:25,225 --> 01:10:28,353
Tomorrow, Tuesday,
training, I'll find a field,

721
01:10:28,353 --> 01:10:31,481
somewhere, I'm just
waiting for confirmations.

722
01:10:31,523 --> 01:10:34,610
Our first game in
fourth against England

723
01:10:34,610 --> 01:10:37,738
not be in the stadiums
hence the main Rio

724
01:10:37,779 --> 01:10:42,910
Is a city about 500 km
northeast of here called Belo Horizonte.

725
01:10:42,951 --> 01:10:48,081
There is a North squad
American, based in Recife,

726
01:10:48,123 --> 01:10:51,251
that will take us to arrange for
there in Brazilian plane transport.

727
01:10:51,293 --> 01:10:54,421
- What the hell is this?
- But good!

728
01:10:55,422 --> 01:11:01,720
Who cares? we are here in Rio
and have the right to have fun.

729
01:11:01,720 --> 01:11:04,806
Whoever wants out tonight?

730
01:11:04,848 --> 01:11:10,062
You do not know what is fun.
The Pee Wee coach party in 5 minutes.

731
01:11:10,103 --> 01:11:14,233
Walter, we have a meeting tonight.

732
01:11:15,234 --> 01:11:21,490
You know what? Let's go out tonight.

733
01:11:21,532 --> 01:11:25,619
All of us will.

734
01:11:25,661 --> 01:11:29,831
We were together as a team.

735
01:12:19,923 --> 01:12:22,009
This is beautiful.

736
01:12:24,094 --> 01:12:29,266
You know, there is much in common
samba, tango and football.

737
01:12:29,308 --> 01:12:31,310
Like what Joe?

738
01:12:31,351 --> 01:12:42,863
Football is more a group of guys
who sing together in the field.

739
01:12:42,863 --> 01:12:44,907
What were you saying?

740
01:12:44,948 --> 01:12:49,745
What I said is that it has much
in common between football and dancing.

741
01:12:52,289 --> 01:12:57,127
Football is like a bunch of guys
dancing together in the field.

742
01:12:58,962 --> 01:13:03,467
It's the rhythm of the game, the way
we move with the changes.

743
01:13:05,802 --> 01:13:08,847
Suddenly, we go with the tide.

744
01:13:08,889 --> 01:13:14,019
And when the chemistry is there, with each
others, and we can make magic on the field.

745
01:13:16,104 --> 01:13:18,732
Sure Joe, I understand,
you think we should go

746
01:13:18,732 --> 01:13:21,318
field with the English
and do the cha-cha?

747
01:13:25,614 --> 01:13:28,200
So to say that
I do not dance well I do not

748
01:13:28,200 --> 01:13:30,827
I play good football?
Because I can not dance.

749
01:14:12,494 --> 01:14:16,665
That is magic Joe, very well.

750
01:14:37,561 --> 01:14:40,689
Gentlemen, welcome to the base of
Air Force in Rio de Janeiro,

751
01:14:40,731 --> 01:14:43,734
I'm Lieutenant Austin.
Would you mind leaving?

752
01:14:43,775 --> 01:14:47,863
Let's take a plane
to Belo Horizonte.

753
01:14:47,905 --> 01:14:51,074
I understand that if
you can follow me.

754
01:14:53,160 --> 01:14:57,331
- What's going on Frank?
- I do not know, come on.

755
01:15:21,313 --> 01:15:24,399
Gentlemen, I present
General William Higgins.

756
01:15:24,441 --> 01:15:29,655
Higgins General, I will give the
football team of the United States.

757
01:15:29,696 --> 01:15:32,783
Welcome, gentlemen.

758
01:15:32,783 --> 01:15:35,911
First, they have
say that today, our president

759
01:15:35,953 --> 01:15:40,082
and commander in chief ordered
that many of our units

760
01:15:40,123 --> 01:15:44,253
traveling through
Pacific for what

761
01:15:44,253 --> 01:15:48,423
unfortunately seems to be
a conflict in Korea.

762
01:15:48,465 --> 01:15:52,636
Gentlemen, is never more important
wear the colors of our nation

763
01:15:52,678 --> 01:15:55,681
than when we are at war.
I'm sure you

764
01:15:55,722 --> 01:15:59,393
will represent our
country with pride and

765
01:15:59,393 --> 01:16:03,021
demonstrate the best of
our warrior spirit.

766
01:16:03,063 --> 01:16:08,235
Win or lose,
and I hope they win.

767
01:16:08,235 --> 01:16:12,406
We'll all be proud of
you and your efforts tomorrow.

768
01:16:12,865 --> 01:16:16,034
Just a warning, as
My father used to say.

769
01:16:16,243 --> 01:16:19,705
Leave everything off the field.

770
01:16:19,746 --> 01:16:24,960
At the request of the president of the Federation North-
American Football, Walter Giesler.

771
01:16:25,002 --> 01:16:30,090
and coach William Jeffrey,

772
01:16:30,132 --> 01:16:35,345
would like to show something to the team
you certainly will need tomorrow.

773
01:16:38,473 --> 01:16:43,187
I understand that the first
will be someone to receive

774
01:16:43,187 --> 01:16:47,900
I was really
concerned with this item.

775
01:16:47,900 --> 01:16:52,070
St. Louis, Missouri
Gino Parian, come here!

776
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:16,011
- Thank you.
- You're welcome, Mr. Parian

777
01:17:23,352 --> 01:17:27,523
Seaman,
Walter Bahr.

778
01:17:35,864 --> 01:17:37,866
Thank you.

779
01:17:37,908 --> 01:17:42,079
Seaman,
Harry Keough.

780
01:17:47,709 --> 01:17:51,880
Coast Guard and Sailor
first class, Charlie Colombo.

781
01:17:57,761 --> 01:18:01,932
The City of New York,
Joseph Gaetjens.

782
01:18:06,103 --> 01:18:10,274
New York,
Joseph Maca.

783
01:18:12,317 --> 01:18:16,488
Army sergeant, John Sousa,
Massachusetts.

784
01:18:20,659 --> 01:18:24,830
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
Ed McIlvenny.

785
01:18:27,958 --> 01:18:31,128
Awarded the Star Brown
for bravery in service.

786
01:18:31,128 --> 01:18:35,299
Army sergeant,
Francis Wallace.

787
01:18:39,469 --> 01:18:43,599
- Very well, Sergeant.
- Thank you, sir.

788
01:18:43,640 --> 01:18:46,226
Awarded two
Hearts-of-Silver and two

789
01:18:46,226 --> 01:18:48,812
Star Brown, sub-sergeant
Army, Frank Borghi.

790
01:19:04,494 --> 01:19:09,708
Thank you to all the
great job for our country.

791
01:19:09,708 --> 01:19:12,836
A salute to our team!

792
01:19:19,092 --> 01:19:23,222
Matthews will not play today. He decided
rest in Rio for the next game.

793
01:19:23,263 --> 01:19:27,392
- Are you taking a vacation?
- I think so.

794
01:19:28,435 --> 01:19:32,606
Finney and Bentley will get the ball more.
Bentley is tall and strong in the air.

795
01:19:32,648 --> 01:19:35,734
Then observe the side
and the bottom line.

796
01:19:35,734 --> 01:19:37,152
Finney will get the ball.

797
01:19:37,152 --> 01:19:39,947
You will be moving to
Mortensen all the time.

798
01:19:39,947 --> 01:19:43,075
- I take care of it.
- Well, Gloves.

799
01:19:45,160 --> 01:19:51,416
We must be patient, we need
be strong and win the ball back.

800
01:19:51,458 --> 01:19:54,044
Gino, Clarkie, you
must be free.

801
01:19:54,044 --> 01:19:55,087
Right.

802
01:19:55,587 --> 01:19:59,716
- Pee Wee, I need you ...
- I'll take care of the right side.

803
01:19:59,758 --> 01:20:02,886
- Right.
- Roger.

804
01:20:02,928 --> 01:20:05,973
Frank wants to say something?

805
01:20:07,015 --> 01:20:13,313
I was just thinking, there is no one that
stands who knows who we are.

806
01:20:14,356 --> 01:20:18,527
Most do not think
should be here.

807
01:20:18,527 --> 01:20:20,571
But we are here.

808
01:20:20,612 --> 01:20:26,869
And we're about to go out there
and play with the best team in the world.

809
01:20:26,910 --> 01:20:28,912
Nobody expects anything from us in the game.

810
01:20:28,954 --> 01:20:33,625
Nothing, but I think at least we

811
01:20:33,625 --> 01:20:37,254
know that we are worth
a little more than that.

812
01:20:38,338 --> 01:20:42,467
Not many people had the
chance that we are having today.

813
01:20:42,467 --> 01:20:46,013
So let's make sure
one thing, that after

814
01:20:46,013 --> 01:20:49,474
90 minutes they will
know who we are.

815
01:20:50,851 --> 01:20:57,065
Right?

816
01:20:57,107 --> 01:21:01,278
- Good game
- Thank you Pee Wee

817
01:21:03,655 --> 01:21:09,578
Welcome to this great game,
England against the United States.

818
01:21:09,620 --> 01:21:14,791
A large audience here today,
as the teams take the field.

819
01:21:15,834 --> 01:21:18,462
The Americans
were in front of more

820
01:21:18,462 --> 01:21:21,048
viewers than
they had ever seen.

821
01:21:21,089 --> 01:21:24,176
38,000 noisy fans in Brazil.

822
01:21:24,218 --> 01:21:26,803
My hope was
they could leave the

823
01:21:26,803 --> 01:21:29,431
field at the end of the game
with their pride intact.

824
01:21:29,431 --> 01:21:32,017
And I wonder what
through the mind of this team

825
01:21:32,017 --> 01:21:34,645
virtually unknown
Americans.

826
01:21:34,686 --> 01:21:37,731
as they heat up in the field.
They will play a leading

827
01:21:37,773 --> 01:21:41,902
in football, a team
feared wherever you play.

828
01:21:41,985 --> 01:21:45,614
Let's have fair play, ok?

829
01:21:45,614 --> 01:21:49,159
- Good Luck!
- Thank you!

830
01:21:49,201 --> 01:21:52,037
And England will defend
the goal to my right,

831
01:21:52,037 --> 01:21:54,831
or rather, attack
the goal to my left,

832
01:21:54,831 --> 01:21:56,917
because that is what we are
predicting that will happen.

833
01:21:57,584 --> 01:22:02,798
Listen, is a gross competition out there
although it is not a war.

834
01:22:02,798 --> 01:22:07,970
If this were a war,
you'd be dead already.

835
01:22:08,011 --> 01:22:09,888
It's a very
bold to say.

836
01:22:10,764 --> 01:22:12,182
I'm serious

837
01:22:16,311 --> 01:22:19,648
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

838
01:22:22,568 --> 01:22:27,781
And what kind of magic to England show
in the next 90 minutes? The game started

839
01:22:27,823 --> 01:22:31,952
and the ball goes straight to Stanley
Mortenson. Stan with the ball.

840
01:22:31,952 --> 01:22:34,580
And try to steal Gaetjens
the ball. Mortenson to

841
01:22:34,580 --> 01:22:37,207
Wright, who plays Tom Finnley.

842
01:22:37,207 --> 01:22:40,335
And England now attacks
the right side of the field,

843
01:22:40,377 --> 01:22:43,422
testing the U.S. defense.

844
01:22:43,463 --> 01:22:47,092
Flip left
with Mannion, he spends his

845
01:22:47,092 --> 01:22:50,721
marker, go to the line
background and cross for Bentley.

846
01:22:50,804 --> 01:22:54,850
Bentley kicks.
Defense Frank Borghi!

847
01:22:54,892 --> 01:22:59,438
Almost a minute of the game and
England almost scored the first goal.

848
01:23:02,232 --> 01:23:09,489
And again they attack the right.
A rocket Mortenson.

849
01:23:09,531 --> 01:23:15,746
And he hit the crossbar at the moment
Frank Borghi is holding England

850
01:23:15,787 --> 01:23:18,916
almost alone! That
sensational performance.

851
01:23:18,916 --> 01:23:22,044
And he hit goal kick
here in Belo Horizonte.

852
01:23:22,085 --> 01:23:27,216
Still 0-0. England, I think it
expect a goal so far.

853
01:23:27,257 --> 01:23:31,345
And Colombia to the attack
easily. Here's Wallace ...

854
01:23:31,386 --> 01:23:36,099
attacking from the right side, is the first
Since the United States will attack.

855
01:23:36,141 --> 01:23:40,771
Aston stop the bid. Here comes England
again with Finney. Finney for Mannion.

856
01:23:40,771 --> 01:23:44,983
Mannion kicks. Great
defense of Frank Borghi!

857
01:23:44,983 --> 01:23:49,154
Plunging toward the ball.
What a great match for him.

858
01:23:49,196 --> 01:23:51,740
What inspiration he is
having. He and his companions

859
01:23:51,740 --> 01:23:54,368
begin to gain strength from his example.

860
01:23:54,409 --> 01:23:58,539
They seem to show signs of life.
And start to attack more aggressively.

861
01:23:58,580 --> 01:24:01,625
Great pass from Harry Keough.
Gaetjens Ball for the strong Gaetjens

862
01:24:01,667 --> 01:24:05,754
spins, kicks and open space!
High, high.

863
01:24:05,796 --> 01:24:12,052
Not very pretty, but did
the audience stood up.

864
01:24:12,052 --> 01:24:16,223
Lack of Dickenson. The public did not like and
American players do not.

865
01:24:16,265 --> 01:24:19,351
Charlie Colombo
argues with the referee.

866
01:24:19,393 --> 01:24:23,021
I wonder if the Americans lose
Now the head and concentration.

867
01:24:23,063 --> 01:24:26,692
And they seem to be concentrated in other
Finney thing and gets behind your back.

868
01:24:26,733 --> 01:24:30,821
Finney on the bottom line, crosses.
Defended!

869
01:24:30,863 --> 01:24:34,950
We must attack now!
We have to attack!

870
01:24:34,992 --> 01:24:38,120
If you keep kicking Benley
and not the ball, will be helping them.

871
01:24:38,161 --> 01:24:41,206
I do not help anyone.

872
01:24:41,248 --> 01:24:45,419
Frank Borghi kicks. And
England creates a further attack by

873
01:24:45,419 --> 01:24:49,590
tries to turn right while
their supremacy into goals.

874
01:24:49,631 --> 01:24:54,845
A great chance for England.
Mortenson now, and he kicks ...

875
01:24:54,845 --> 01:25:00,017
out.
Mortenson hardly believe.

876
01:25:00,058 --> 01:25:05,230
The sides are still closed.
But then comes back to England

877
01:25:05,272 --> 01:25:08,901
as a blue wave.
Mortenson again, turns,

878
01:25:08,901 --> 01:25:12,529
open space and kicks. Great
defense of Frank Borghi!

879
01:25:12,571 --> 01:25:18,285
Roll the ball now for McIlvenny.
McIlvenny search for Eddie Souza.

880
01:25:20,871 --> 01:25:26,126
McIlvenny comes to hitting the side.
The Americans then doing well

881
01:25:26,126 --> 01:25:29,213
and now is their chance
to establish control.

882
01:25:29,254 --> 01:25:34,468
The defender is beaten to the captain
Walter Bahr. He had seen the play ...

883
01:25:36,595 --> 01:25:39,681
And that goal!
The United States takes the lead.

884
01:25:53,612 --> 01:25:57,366
A great pass from Bahr
to Gaetjens butt.

885
01:26:04,706 --> 01:26:06,792
The England players
look at each

886
01:26:06,792 --> 01:26:08,877
others trying to understand
what went wrong.

887
01:26:08,919 --> 01:26:13,048
The American players
jump on top of each other.

888
01:26:14,091 --> 01:26:16,176
Put on the head. We
just wake them up.

889
01:26:16,176 --> 01:26:18,262
They going to come up with everything, Pee Wee.

890
01:26:18,303 --> 01:26:22,349
The stadium goes wild,
and it is no surprise,

891
01:26:22,391 --> 01:26:25,519
because over 8 minutes to the end

892
01:26:25,519 --> 01:26:28,647
the 1st time, the score
England is 0, USA 1.

893
01:26:28,689 --> 01:26:34,903
Here comes the new England outlining
a reaction strikes again, with Mortenson.

894
01:26:34,945 --> 01:26:38,031
Defended.

895
01:26:38,073 --> 01:26:42,202
Crossing to Mortenson and
yet another defense of Borghi!

896
01:26:42,244 --> 01:26:47,416
Mortenson and can not score a goal
to England when they need it.

897
01:26:47,457 --> 01:26:50,043
And England will have to
wait for the 2nd time

898
01:26:50,043 --> 01:26:52,671
find a way to
Frank Borghi pass.

899
01:26:52,713 --> 01:26:54,715
Great job. More than 45 minutes.

900
01:27:07,227 --> 01:27:10,397
I would rather
your time guys.

901
01:27:14,568 --> 01:27:20,282
Can you imagine what the coach
them are now saying in the locker room.

902
01:27:20,324 --> 01:27:26,038
You just wake up a fierce lion,
and he will be furious as ever.

903
01:27:26,038 --> 01:27:31,251
And in that second half will want to
crush you like a hammer.

904
01:27:31,251 --> 01:27:41,678
At the end of that game will be decided by
two things, character and endurance.

905
01:27:41,720 --> 01:27:46,850
The first time you showed
them to have character.

906
01:27:46,892 --> 01:27:53,148
In this second half will show you
them that you have resistance.

907
01:27:53,190 --> 01:27:57,319
Good game guys. Enjoy.

908
01:27:58,445 --> 01:28:02,616
There are still 45 minutes to
England change the course of the game.

909
01:28:02,616 --> 01:28:06,828
Oranges in the England dressing room
probably had a bitter taste, but

910
01:28:06,828 --> 01:28:11,500
is coming to England again in the attack.
Finney crosses looking for Hughes.

911
01:28:11,542 --> 01:28:16,171
Disarmed by the American defense.
A goal kick is beaten by Frank Borghi.

912
01:28:16,588 --> 01:28:18,757
It was clear that the Americans

913
01:28:18,757 --> 01:28:22,469
entered the field in 2nd half
believing they can win.

914
01:28:22,511 --> 01:28:26,598
The British knew that the fans
home would be disappointed

915
01:28:26,640 --> 01:28:29,685
if they do not return as
world champions.

916
01:28:29,726 --> 01:28:33,897
But losing to the Americans,
it was unimaginable.

917
01:28:41,238 --> 01:28:47,494
Here comes Mannion of England, passes through
two Americans, plays for Bentley.

918
01:28:47,494 --> 01:28:52,666
And it kicks!
And hit the woodwork again!

919
01:28:52,708 --> 01:28:55,794
Frank Borghi now organizing
the U.S. defense.

920
01:28:55,836 --> 01:28:59,464
They still
holding England.

921
01:28:59,464 --> 01:29:03,051
Still keeping the faith
his heroic effort.

922
01:29:03,093 --> 01:29:07,264
England again, kick Finney.

923
01:29:07,264 --> 01:29:11,435
You have to do better than
Frank Borghi to hit it.

924
01:29:11,476 --> 01:29:15,606
England again. Come with
John, of Manchester United.

925
01:29:15,647 --> 01:29:19,776
forward again by
U.S. defense

926
01:29:19,818 --> 01:29:22,946
Frustration for attack
English, because the defense

927
01:29:22,946 --> 01:29:26,074
strip the ball. But only
temporarily because

928
01:29:26,116 --> 01:29:30,245
Mannion is coming, and it crosses Frank
Borghi is pushed by Mortenson.

929
01:29:30,329 --> 01:29:33,957
Americans are
crazy, Colombo pushes

930
01:29:33,957 --> 01:29:37,628
Mortenson to the ground.
They still held firm.

931
01:29:38,545 --> 01:29:44,051
And the Americans fight
aggression through his football.

932
01:29:44,092 --> 01:29:49,473
1-0 to the USA. An amazing score
one could imagine.

933
01:29:49,515 --> 01:29:51,850
And the Americans
try to do the latter.

934
01:29:51,850 --> 01:29:54,228
Gaetjens now, back to Wallace.

935
01:29:54,228 --> 01:29:59,441
Wallace and goes back to play
Gaetjens. Now with John Souza.

936
01:29:59,483 --> 01:30:02,528
Kick! Kick!

937
01:30:02,569 --> 01:30:08,742
Chute de Souza.
And stop the steady hands of Bert Williams.

938
01:30:08,784 --> 01:30:13,956
Here come the United States again,
this time with Gino Parian.

939
01:30:13,997 --> 01:30:17,125
Coming from the left side,
it is marked by Hughs,

940
01:30:17,125 --> 01:30:20,254
Liverpool, he dribbles and
goes to the bottom line.

941
01:30:20,295 --> 01:30:24,466
Hughes and stops the play,
corner for America.

942
01:30:24,466 --> 01:30:28,637
Everyone waits for the beat of the corner.

943
01:30:28,637 --> 01:30:32,808
There has been searching for and Gaetjens
Eddie Souza face of the beam.

944
01:30:32,850 --> 01:30:37,980
And England is almost
losing by two goals.

945
01:30:38,021 --> 01:30:43,193
Mannion with a cross kick.
And he returns the ball to Frank Borghi.

946
01:30:43,277 --> 01:30:48,365
And the American team is showing
a great performance in the defense

947
01:30:48,407 --> 01:30:50,492
Will they keep the game as well?

948
01:30:50,492 --> 01:30:52,536
England Expects
that the U.S. will fail.

949
01:30:52,578 --> 01:30:56,748
Still looking for a draw
with Mortenson. And it kicks!

950
01:30:56,748 --> 01:31:00,961
In the beam and the Americans were
to move close together.

951
01:31:00,961 --> 01:31:02,546
Benley kicks it up!

952
01:31:05,924 --> 01:31:08,260
Americans look to the ground

953
01:31:08,260 --> 01:31:10,846
desperate to
hear the final whistle

954
01:31:10,846 --> 01:31:13,473
but there still to do, here comes
England once more.

955
01:31:13,515 --> 01:31:17,102
England on the attack,
Borghi organizes the defense.

956
01:31:17,102 --> 01:31:20,022
Cross from the
left, he receives

957
01:31:20,022 --> 01:31:22,941
Finney plays for.
Finney gives a weak kick

958
01:31:23,025 --> 01:31:25,110
And Charlie Colombo takes the ball.

959
01:31:25,235 --> 01:31:27,988
They are the English who have
lions on the shirts,

960
01:31:28,030 --> 01:31:31,158
but the Americans are
fought for every ball like lions.

961
01:31:31,783 --> 01:31:34,912
Here comes Finney, and he is knocked down
almost in line with the large area.

962
01:31:35,037 --> 01:31:38,999
Great tackling from Charlie Colombo.

963
01:31:38,999 --> 01:31:42,920
He is a
Colombo this personality.

964
01:31:42,961 --> 01:31:46,381
And England won a corner.

965
01:31:48,467 --> 01:31:49,927
Hits the corner, left foot.

966
01:31:55,474 --> 01:32:00,646
Defense Frank Borghi!
32 minutes into the second half.

967
01:32:00,687 --> 01:32:06,401
Here they come again with Mannion.
Plays for Biegn, which passes to Branty,

968
01:32:06,443 --> 01:32:10,030
that returns to Mannion. A
big step for Mortenson.

969
01:32:10,239 --> 01:32:11,907
It can be a goal.

970
01:32:12,157 --> 01:32:14,201
What a defense!

971
01:32:20,457 --> 01:32:23,627
The Americans run
to greet their hero.

972
01:32:23,627 --> 01:32:25,838
Frank Borghi left
the whole audience standing.

973
01:32:30,926 --> 01:32:34,012
England begins to wonder if
be able to find a way

974
01:32:34,054 --> 01:32:36,139
to go through this magnificent goalkeeper.

975
01:32:36,139 --> 01:32:39,518
But they try more
Once again, Bentley is coming ...

976
01:32:40,811 --> 01:32:42,896
And he hits the part
above the crossbar.

977
01:32:44,481 --> 01:32:48,610
Time is running out of England,
the referee just look at the clock.

978
01:32:48,652 --> 01:32:52,823
A second seems like an eternity
for Americans.

979
01:32:52,865 --> 01:32:56,952
Here comes the left Mortenson,
and was an easy defense

980
01:32:56,952 --> 01:33:02,165
Frank Borghi. And desperation
is the face of the legendary player.

981
01:33:02,207 --> 01:33:06,336
Everyone on the attack now
to England.

982
01:33:06,336 --> 01:33:10,507
All the waiting
Finney crossing.

983
01:33:10,549 --> 01:33:13,677
Here comes the crossing can be
last chance for the British.

984
01:33:27,232 --> 01:33:29,443
And the referee blows ...

985
01:33:31,278 --> 01:33:33,155
the end of the match.

986
01:33:46,001 --> 01:33:48,045
And suddenly was over.

987
01:33:48,086 --> 01:33:52,174
Something that I thought
could never happen.

988
01:33:52,216 --> 01:33:55,886
I thought, who would
believe that,

989
01:33:55,886 --> 01:33:59,515
whether in England or
in the United States?

990
01:33:59,556 --> 01:34:02,643
If I had not seen it with my
own eyes I would not believe.

991
01:34:02,684 --> 01:34:06,813
The country that gave the game
football to the world

992
01:34:06,813 --> 01:34:12,069
received the biggest shock
the history of world football.

993
01:34:15,197 --> 01:34:18,283
It was difficult to continue as a reporter.

994
01:34:18,325 --> 01:34:23,539
I wanted to run into
field along with the Brazilians.

995
01:34:54,820 --> 01:35:01,034
This was simply the greatest
accomplishment achieved by any team

996
01:35:01,118 --> 01:35:04,121
in any sport I've ever seen.

997
01:35:04,162 --> 01:35:06,248
It is an honor to present members

998
01:35:06,248 --> 01:35:08,333
the football team
United States, 1950

999
01:35:08,375 --> 01:35:10,460
who participated in that
which was considered

1000
01:35:10,460 --> 01:35:12,504
the most Zebra history
the World Cups

1001
01:35:12,504 --> 01:35:14,506
when they defeated
England by 1-0.

1002
01:35:14,548 --> 01:35:16,258
