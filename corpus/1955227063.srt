[Police sirens]

2
00:01:12,706 --> 00:01:13,407
Out of my way.

3
00:01:13,507 --> 00:01:14,242
Out of my way!

4
00:01:14,342 --> 00:01:16,210
[Gunshot]

5
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:20,648
[Police sirens]

00:02:08,896 --> 00:02:14,302
[Police sirens]

7
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:38,952
[Police sirens]

8
00:03:40,187 --> 00:03:41,722
[Tires squealing]

9
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:13,381
[Breathing heavily]

10
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:19,853
WOMAN: Hi.

11
00:05:19,953 --> 00:05:21,355
Do I know you?

12
00:05:31,899 --> 00:05:33,266
Are you looking for something?

13
00:05:44,311 --> 00:05:46,714
No!

14
00:05:46,814 --> 00:05:47,648
Police!

15
00:05:47,748 --> 00:05:50,083
Drop your weapon!

16
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:54,054
Hands in the air,
where I can see them.

17
00:05:54,154 --> 00:05:56,289
Back off!

18
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:58,258
Back off!

19
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,193
[Crying]

20
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:01,395
This is car 315.

21
00:06:01,495 --> 00:06:04,031
Suspect has taken a female
Caucasian as hostage.

22
00:06:04,131 --> 00:06:07,701
Where the fuck
did she come from?

23
00:06:07,801 --> 00:06:11,639
Why should I keep
my hands in the air?

24
00:06:11,739 --> 00:06:12,940
Give it up.

25
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,408
You're completely surrounded.

26
00:06:14,508 --> 00:06:16,343
There's nowhere to run.

27
00:06:16,444 --> 00:06:18,679
Give yourself up and let her go.

28
00:06:18,779 --> 00:06:20,781
Just back off,
you motherfuckers!

29
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:22,483
There's nowhere to go.

30
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:23,451
Back off, you motherfuckers!

31
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:34,762
Just back off, or
I'll blow her brains

32
00:06:34,862 --> 00:06:37,230
Out if you don't do what I say.

33
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,868
Do it!

34
00:06:44,572 --> 00:06:45,272
Do it!

35
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:55,649
Do it!

36
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:56,450
Do it!

37
00:07:08,596 --> 00:07:09,296
OK.

38
00:07:09,396 --> 00:07:10,097
We'll back off.

39
00:07:31,384 --> 00:07:32,753
You came out of that house?

40
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:45,699
Take me to a safe place.

41
00:08:00,881 --> 00:08:01,582
Hurry.

42
00:08:06,654 --> 00:08:10,057
What's keeping you?

43
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:11,024
I can't reach it.

44
00:08:16,697 --> 00:08:18,699
I have suspect
in a clear range.

45
00:08:18,799 --> 00:08:20,167
Ask permission to fire.

46
00:08:20,267 --> 00:08:21,068
Permission granted.

47
00:08:35,082 --> 00:08:36,917
[Gunshot]

48
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:38,652
You cunts!

49
00:08:38,752 --> 00:08:39,953
Don't shoot.

50
00:08:40,053 --> 00:08:41,454
You want more dead bodies?

51
00:08:41,555 --> 00:08:43,190
I'll give you more.

52
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:45,759
It makes no fucking
difference to me.

53
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:47,494
Did I make myself clear?

54
00:08:47,595 --> 00:08:50,063
[Gunshot]

55
00:08:50,163 --> 00:08:52,900
I said, did I make myself clear?

56
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,935
Whatever you do, don't shoot.

57
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:08,949
The suspect is
entering the house.

58
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:10,283
We're waiting for instructions.

59
00:09:20,527 --> 00:09:22,395
What's keeping you?

60
00:09:22,495 --> 00:09:24,364
I'm looking for
the fucking key.

61
00:09:24,464 --> 00:09:25,365
Oh shit.

62
00:09:25,465 --> 00:09:26,166
Not again.

63
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:32,873
- Ahh.
- Hurry.

64
00:09:32,973 --> 00:09:33,674
Close the door.

65
00:09:44,184 --> 00:09:46,987
What the hell were you
doing in this place?

66
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:48,255
I live here.

67
00:09:48,355 --> 00:09:49,189
Yeah, sure.

68
00:09:56,563 --> 00:09:58,732
Oh, you mother... ahh!

69
00:09:58,832 --> 00:10:00,467
Take me to a room where
I can see everything

70
00:10:00,567 --> 00:10:01,969
That's going on outside.

71
00:10:02,069 --> 00:10:02,803
Yes.

72
00:10:02,903 --> 00:10:04,337
There's a room... the bedroom.

73
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,439
There's the stairs to the attic.

74
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:08,608
Take me there now.

75
00:10:08,709 --> 00:10:10,077
Ahh.

76
00:10:10,177 --> 00:10:10,878
Come on.

77
00:10:10,978 --> 00:10:11,679
Hurry up.

78
00:10:31,331 --> 00:10:33,500
I can't see shit from here.

79
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,836
I told you I needed a room
where I could see everything.

80
00:10:35,936 --> 00:10:37,537
I have to know what
those bastards are up to.

81
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:40,307
Who do you think you're
messing with, eh?

82
00:10:40,407 --> 00:10:41,241
Tell me.

83
00:10:41,341 --> 00:10:42,042
Tell me, bitch!

84
00:10:45,112 --> 00:10:48,481
[Crying]

85
00:11:20,247 --> 00:11:21,081
Great.

86
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:21,882
Ressler.

87
00:11:26,553 --> 00:11:27,220
Yeah.

88
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:43,703
Good morning, sir.

89
00:11:43,804 --> 00:11:44,537
Who is he?

90
00:11:44,637 --> 00:11:46,573
Jason Goodis, a bank robber.

91
00:11:46,673 --> 00:11:49,943
He popped three men at
the First General Bank.

92
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:50,944
And who is she?

93
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:54,614
We don't know... yet.

94
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:55,415
Right.

95
00:12:25,979 --> 00:12:28,348
You fucking pervert.

96
00:12:28,448 --> 00:12:30,417
Leave me alone.

97
00:12:30,517 --> 00:12:31,919
OFFICER WALLS (ON
MEGAPHONE): Goodis, my name

98
00:12:32,019 --> 00:12:33,954
Is Police Officer
Walls, and next to me

99
00:12:34,054 --> 00:12:36,689
Is Mr. Carl Ressler,
the official negotiator.

100
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:38,758
He'll be taking over.

101
00:12:38,859 --> 00:12:41,628
Let me repeat... you're
completely surrounded.

102
00:12:41,728 --> 00:12:42,830
There's no escape.

103
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:45,132
Drop your weapons and free
the hostage, and nobody

104
00:12:45,232 --> 00:12:45,966
Will get hurt.

105
00:12:49,036 --> 00:12:51,038
Don't shoot, officer.

106
00:12:51,138 --> 00:12:51,939
Please.

107
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:53,173
Don't shoot.

108
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:55,675
Oh, I'll release the hostage.

109
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:58,478
How do you want her,
eat here or take away?

110
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:04,417
(YELLING) Get me out of here!

111
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:05,385
Please!

112
00:13:05,485 --> 00:13:06,820
Get me out of here!

113
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,121
Shut the fuck up.

114
00:13:08,221 --> 00:13:11,291
If you ever get out of here,
it'll be dead... or alive,

115
00:13:11,391 --> 00:13:14,761
If you are very, very quiet.

116
00:13:14,862 --> 00:13:16,930
It makes no difference to me!

117
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:17,730
Ahh.

118
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,169
Maybe you need something
that will help you remember

119
00:13:22,269 --> 00:13:24,004
To keep your mouth shut.

120
00:13:24,104 --> 00:13:26,506
I really hate it when
I'm not taken seriously.

121
00:13:32,846 --> 00:13:34,214
This is Sniper One.

122
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:35,515
There's movement
on the upper floor.

123
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:36,783
OFFICER (ON RADIO):
Roger, Sniper One.

124
00:13:36,884 --> 00:13:37,750
Keep me posted.

125
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:48,695
Don't say "cheese"
when you smile.

126
00:13:51,798 --> 00:13:54,868
Holy shit.

127
00:13:54,968 --> 00:13:58,338
OFFICER (ON RADIO):
Sniper One, don't shoot.

128
00:13:58,438 --> 00:14:00,807
OK, Ressler.

129
00:14:00,908 --> 00:14:02,275
Here's the deal.

130
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:04,777
I want a car to take
me to the airport.

131
00:14:04,878 --> 00:14:09,716
In the trunk, there's a
neat million in used bills.

132
00:14:09,816 --> 00:14:11,919
Do you need a driver?

133
00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:14,787
I have my driver's
license, Ressler.

134
00:14:14,888 --> 00:14:17,324
You can save your breath.

135
00:14:17,424 --> 00:14:19,092
You have one hour.

136
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:24,064
After that, I start working
on the girl... end of show.

137
00:14:24,164 --> 00:14:24,864
Close the curtains.

138
00:14:46,353 --> 00:14:48,755
[Crying]

139
00:14:58,531 --> 00:14:59,199
Ah!

140
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,547
Nothing on the hostage.

141
00:15:14,647 --> 00:15:16,349
The neighbors hardly know her.

142
00:15:16,449 --> 00:15:17,985
Some say she lives
in that room, others

143
00:15:18,085 --> 00:15:19,419
Say that she's the caretaker.

144
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:22,555
The fact is, she sometimes
brings men there.

145
00:15:22,655 --> 00:15:27,060
No known acquaintances, family,
friends, only a name... Ella.

146
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:27,860
Mmm.

147
00:15:27,961 --> 00:15:29,362
I see.

148
00:15:29,462 --> 00:15:30,998
The whole neighborhood
is fucking her,

149
00:15:31,098 --> 00:15:33,533
And... and, of course,
nobody knows her.

150
00:15:33,633 --> 00:15:34,734
Makes sense.

151
00:15:34,834 --> 00:15:38,038
AnD there's no rich daddy
to pay the bill, huh?

152
00:15:38,138 --> 00:15:40,240
What's wrong with you?

153
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:45,178
Ella... I remember her.

154
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:46,579
You know the girl?

155
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:48,415
You met her somewhere?

156
00:15:48,515 --> 00:15:49,916
I don't know.

157
00:15:50,017 --> 00:15:51,251
It's her eyes.

158
00:15:51,351 --> 00:15:54,387
Hey, you weren't one of those
guys fucking her, are you?

159
00:15:54,487 --> 00:15:56,589
It's nothing like that at all.

160
00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:58,058
Come on.

161
00:15:58,158 --> 00:16:00,393
We won't tell your wife.

162
00:16:00,493 --> 00:16:07,300
I met her, but
I can't remember.

163
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,769
It's... it's that house.

164
00:16:09,869 --> 00:16:13,406
She was a suspect,
uh... a victim.

165
00:16:13,506 --> 00:16:14,207
Shit.

166
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:16,676
I can't remember.

167
00:16:16,776 --> 00:16:21,148
Only those hypnotizing eyes.

168
00:16:21,248 --> 00:16:22,649
Crazy son of a bitch.

169
00:16:44,104 --> 00:16:47,474
[Crying]

170
00:17:12,265 --> 00:17:13,066
Stefan, are you all right?

171
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,043
Never look at an
unfinished work.

172
00:17:24,144 --> 00:17:25,545
I know it means bad luck.

173
00:17:25,645 --> 00:17:27,046
You always say that.

174
00:17:27,147 --> 00:17:28,548
[Laugh]

175
00:17:28,648 --> 00:17:29,516
No.

176
00:17:29,616 --> 00:17:30,783
Come on, Stevie.

177
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:33,019
You've been painting my
portrait for three months now.

178
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,021
Soon you'll have to
paint extra wrinkles.

179
00:19:33,373 --> 00:19:34,774
Please.

180
00:19:34,874 --> 00:19:36,776
Don't.

181
00:19:36,876 --> 00:19:37,977
Please.

182
00:19:38,077 --> 00:19:38,778
Shh.

183
00:19:42,482 --> 00:19:45,084
I'll tell you one thing, lady.

184
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:49,522
The first thing you lose is
that big, waggy tongue of yours.

185
00:19:49,622 --> 00:19:52,525
Maybe I'll cut it
out now and throw it

186
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:55,495
To them, just so they'll
know I'm really serious.

187
00:19:55,595 --> 00:19:59,432
And don't think... just
don't think for one fucking

188
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:01,634
Split second that I'm bluffing.

189
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:19,586
My god, is this blood?

190
00:20:19,686 --> 00:20:23,523
This thing looks like it
came from a slaughterhouse.

191
00:20:23,623 --> 00:20:26,493
I always liked
slaughterhouses, you know...

192
00:20:26,593 --> 00:20:29,962
All those tools, and blood.

193
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:31,898
Blood everywhere.

194
00:20:31,998 --> 00:20:36,669
Take care that your
blood isn't on here soon.

195
00:20:36,769 --> 00:20:40,473
I'd rather enjoy cutting you
up into a thousand pieces...

196
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:42,309
Much more so than
I would a steer.

197
00:20:51,117 --> 00:20:52,452
This tool can come
in handy, too.

198
00:20:55,688 --> 00:20:58,291
OFFICER WALCE (ON MEGAPHONE):
Goodis, listen to me.

199
00:20:58,391 --> 00:20:59,992
There's a delay with the plan.

200
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:02,194
We need to know
your destination.

201
00:21:02,295 --> 00:21:04,797
Now, Mr. Ressler would
like to talk to you.

202
00:21:04,897 --> 00:21:06,065
Do you hear me?

203
00:21:06,165 --> 00:21:08,668
Please come near the window.

204
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:09,902
OFFICER (ON RADIO):
Sniper One, shoot

205
00:21:10,002 --> 00:21:11,604
Whenever you have a clear shot.

206
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:21,514
Don't move.

207
00:21:26,018 --> 00:21:31,824
Cut the crap, Ressler, or
I'll start to cut her up now.

208
00:21:31,924 --> 00:21:34,160
In 30 minutes, you
can expect her tongue.

209
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:36,128
Discussion closed, Ressler.

210
00:21:44,103 --> 00:21:45,938
Anything you want to say?

211
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:48,908
Any last words?

212
00:21:49,008 --> 00:21:50,410
Now is the time.

213
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:37,890
Please.

214
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:38,691
Let me explain.

215
00:22:38,791 --> 00:22:40,593
This is not what it seems.

216
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:42,562
Please.

217
00:22:42,662 --> 00:22:48,468
I know perfectly well that
things are not what they seem.

218
00:22:48,568 --> 00:22:52,905
After all, I've been listening
to your lies long enough.

219
00:23:14,761 --> 00:23:18,898
At least you know now, Dad.

220
00:23:18,998 --> 00:23:22,769
At least try to keep
your lies straight,

221
00:23:22,869 --> 00:23:26,338
And do not insult
my intelligence.

222
00:23:26,439 --> 00:23:28,941
There is only one
thing I know for sure.

223
00:23:29,041 --> 00:23:31,110
You've been painting very hard.

224
00:23:41,654 --> 00:23:42,555
No!

225
00:23:42,655 --> 00:23:44,056
Stop it!

226
00:23:44,156 --> 00:23:45,558
Leave him alone.

227
00:23:45,658 --> 00:23:46,759
No!

228
00:23:46,859 --> 00:23:47,560
No!

229
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:49,529
Stop it, please.

230
00:23:49,629 --> 00:23:52,031
[Crying] Please.

231
00:23:52,131 --> 00:23:55,001
No!

232
00:23:55,101 --> 00:23:56,503
Ahh.

233
00:23:56,603 --> 00:23:58,004
No!

234
00:23:58,104 --> 00:24:01,073
[Crying] [screaming]

235
00:24:01,173 --> 00:24:01,874
Ahh.

236
00:24:01,974 --> 00:24:03,543
Ahh.

237
00:24:03,643 --> 00:24:04,477
Ahh.

238
00:24:04,577 --> 00:24:06,813
WOMAN: [screaming]
Please, stop it!

239
00:24:06,913 --> 00:24:08,314
Please!

240
00:24:08,414 --> 00:24:09,782
No.

241
00:24:09,882 --> 00:24:12,451
No.

242
00:24:12,552 --> 00:24:13,252
No.

243
00:24:13,352 --> 00:24:15,221
Please.

244
00:24:15,321 --> 00:24:18,190
Stop it.

245
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:20,159
No.

246
00:24:20,259 --> 00:24:21,628
Stop it, now.

247
00:24:24,263 --> 00:24:28,568
How long have you been his
mother, for three months?

248
00:24:28,668 --> 00:24:30,937
And that's the result?

249
00:24:31,037 --> 00:24:33,940
How long have you
been fucking him... us?

250
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:36,275
Did you compare the two of us?

251
00:24:36,375 --> 00:24:38,645
I have never made
love to Stefan.

252
00:24:38,745 --> 00:24:40,012
You're a liar.

253
00:24:40,112 --> 00:24:42,248
But even then, it's not hard
to decide who's the best lover.

254
00:24:42,348 --> 00:24:45,317
After all, I was almost
playing the nurse with you.

255
00:24:51,357 --> 00:24:53,259
Maybe this will beat
some sense into you.

256
00:24:58,731 --> 00:24:59,632
No.

257
00:24:59,732 --> 00:25:05,471
[Crying] No.

258
00:25:12,411 --> 00:25:16,015
I'll break every bone in
your miserable body, you

259
00:25:16,115 --> 00:25:18,885
Fucking shit.

260
00:25:18,985 --> 00:25:21,287
No!

261
00:25:21,387 --> 00:25:23,289
You'll pay for every kiss.

262
00:25:23,389 --> 00:25:25,692
You'll fucking bleed
where she touched you.

263
00:25:32,298 --> 00:25:36,669
[Gagging]

264
00:25:47,747 --> 00:25:51,150
[Coughing]

265
00:26:08,701 --> 00:26:11,604
Ahh!

266
00:26:11,704 --> 00:26:14,106
Ahh.

267
00:26:14,206 --> 00:26:16,108
[Coughing]

268
00:26:18,377 --> 00:26:19,078
Ahh.

269
00:26:39,298 --> 00:26:43,202
MAN: [moaning]

270
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:40,592
[Coughing]

271
00:27:49,368 --> 00:27:50,069
Ahh!

272
00:28:13,325 --> 00:28:14,026
Ahh!

273
00:28:28,775 --> 00:28:29,475
MAN: Ahh!

274
00:28:35,081 --> 00:28:35,982
No.

275
00:28:36,082 --> 00:28:36,983
No.

276
00:28:37,083 --> 00:28:37,784
No!

277
00:28:49,295 --> 00:28:50,930
Ow, that hurts.

278
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:51,898
It fucking hurts.

279
00:28:51,998 --> 00:28:52,698
Ah.

280
00:28:56,402 --> 00:28:58,270
I was thinking...
That is, before you

281
00:28:58,370 --> 00:29:00,206
Scared the shit out of me.

282
00:29:00,306 --> 00:29:03,675
Aren't you interested
in what I was thinking?

283
00:29:03,776 --> 00:29:07,046
You should be, as it
might concern you.

284
00:29:07,146 --> 00:29:07,947
Come on.

285
00:29:08,047 --> 00:29:09,448
Ask me what I was thinking.

286
00:29:09,548 --> 00:29:10,516
Come on!
Ah!

287
00:29:10,616 --> 00:29:11,683
Ask me what I was thinking.

288
00:29:14,987 --> 00:29:15,855
What?

289
00:29:15,955 --> 00:29:19,792
What were you thinking?

290
00:29:19,892 --> 00:29:24,496
I saw myself on the way to
paradise for all of the money

291
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:27,666
I'll be getting for you.

292
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:29,368
But you know what?

293
00:29:29,468 --> 00:29:32,004
It was so damn expensive.

294
00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:35,741
A waiter's tip there would
buy a guy a classy girl here.

295
00:29:35,842 --> 00:29:39,211
I had to look for a stupid job.

296
00:29:39,311 --> 00:29:43,015
I had to wash dishes to survive.

297
00:29:43,115 --> 00:29:44,984
And the only trouble
with paradise

298
00:29:45,084 --> 00:29:48,120
Is there's nowhere
to go from there.

299
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:48,921
You know?

300
00:29:51,991 --> 00:29:53,860
Ahh.

301
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,828
Come on, keep up the
conversation for Christ

302
00:29:55,928 --> 00:29:58,297
Sakes, or I'll cut
your tongue out now.

303
00:29:58,397 --> 00:30:01,100
OK.

304
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,402
So what are you going to do?

305
00:30:03,502 --> 00:30:04,470
I

306
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:07,106
Think I didn't ask
enough money for you.

307
00:30:07,206 --> 00:30:08,841
You're worth a lot more.

308
00:30:08,941 --> 00:30:11,878
So, there are two solutions.

309
00:30:11,978 --> 00:30:13,379
What?

310
00:30:13,479 --> 00:30:15,882
What solutions?

311
00:30:15,982 --> 00:30:20,853
I can ask [inaudible]
for more money.

312
00:30:20,953 --> 00:30:23,355
I don't think they'll listen.

313
00:30:23,455 --> 00:30:24,323
But I'll try.

314
00:30:24,423 --> 00:30:25,824
Don't you fucking touch me!

315
00:30:25,925 --> 00:30:28,027
Keep your damn hands off me.

316
00:30:28,127 --> 00:30:28,827
Ah.

317
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:50,716
Ressler, are you listening?

318
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:57,689
Ressler, for Christ's sakes.

319
00:30:57,789 --> 00:30:59,758
RESSLER (ON MEGAPHONE):
I'm listening.

320
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:02,761
The price is going up, Ressler.

321
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:06,232
I want another 500 grand.

322
00:31:06,332 --> 00:31:09,735
She is still in good
health, after all.

323
00:31:09,835 --> 00:31:12,704
We have a nice chat
every now and then.

324
00:31:12,804 --> 00:31:13,539
Fuck.

325
00:31:13,639 --> 00:31:14,473
You know, we need more time.

326
00:31:14,573 --> 00:31:16,642
Yeah right.

327
00:31:16,742 --> 00:31:19,511
I'm getting harsh, Ressler.

328
00:31:19,611 --> 00:31:22,414
Get me the rest of the money!

329
00:31:22,514 --> 00:31:23,515
End of discussion.

330
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:30,689
The other solution is
to stick with the lower

331
00:31:30,789 --> 00:31:34,994
Sum of $1 million, and take the
rest out in trade, so to speak.

332
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:42,001
Your lover?

333
00:31:46,572 --> 00:31:49,675
You might say he's my ex.

334
00:31:49,775 --> 00:31:50,476
Divorced?

335
00:31:54,546 --> 00:31:57,449
Men just disappear, you know.

336
00:31:57,549 --> 00:32:00,953
You really live
here, don't you?

337
00:32:01,053 --> 00:32:02,955
I have to take
care of the house.

338
00:32:08,027 --> 00:32:10,929
You did a good job.

339
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:15,434
It's a big house
to keep [inaudible].

340
00:32:15,534 --> 00:32:18,904
Why don't you sell it?

341
00:32:19,005 --> 00:32:21,407
Nobody wants it.

342
00:32:21,507 --> 00:32:24,410
It has history.

343
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:28,047
It sounds like a
bedtime story, but one

344
00:32:28,147 --> 00:32:30,382
That will keep you awake.

345
00:32:30,482 --> 00:32:31,883
Try me.

346
00:32:31,984 --> 00:32:32,884
Read the papers.

347
00:32:46,665 --> 00:32:47,366
Ella.

348
00:32:47,466 --> 00:32:50,836
Is that your name?

349
00:32:50,936 --> 00:32:52,838
It's nice.

350
00:32:52,938 --> 00:32:54,340
It kind of fits, too.

351
00:33:00,412 --> 00:33:01,813
This is really something.

352
00:33:07,419 --> 00:33:10,822
What the fuck?

353
00:33:10,922 --> 00:33:14,293
Do you still want to hear
my sales pitch for the house?

354
00:33:14,393 --> 00:33:15,794
Shut up.

355
00:33:15,894 --> 00:33:17,296
Shut the hell up.

356
00:33:27,373 --> 00:33:31,277
And I thought my
situation was ill.

357
00:33:31,377 --> 00:33:33,245
But you look like you survived.

358
00:33:33,345 --> 00:33:37,749
Oh, you learn how to survive
after things go wrong.

359
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:39,251
Huh.

360
00:33:39,351 --> 00:33:42,754
I hope I have a chance
to survive this.

361
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:45,724
I'm sure you will.

362
00:33:45,824 --> 00:33:48,727
They don't want anything
to happen to me.

363
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:56,202
You know, you look like
someone I used to know.

364
00:33:56,302 --> 00:33:58,204
Really?

365
00:33:58,304 --> 00:33:59,338
How is she now?

366
00:33:59,438 --> 00:34:00,372
RESSLER (ON MEGAPHONE): Goodis.

367
00:34:00,472 --> 00:34:02,174
You hear me?

368
00:34:02,274 --> 00:34:04,376
The car will be
here in one hour.

369
00:34:04,476 --> 00:34:07,146
The ransom money
will be in the trunk.

370
00:34:12,218 --> 00:34:13,585
That's too fucking long!

371
00:34:19,625 --> 00:34:23,462
Don't look at me like that.

372
00:34:23,562 --> 00:34:26,932
This shit is really
getting to me.

373
00:34:27,032 --> 00:34:29,401
Today is just one
fucked up mess.

374
00:34:29,501 --> 00:34:31,370
It began with the guard
at the First General.

375
00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:33,839
He wasn't supposed to be there.

376
00:34:33,939 --> 00:34:36,842
I just panicked and shot him.

377
00:34:36,942 --> 00:34:38,910
I had to!

378
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:40,412
And then you got in the way.

379
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:42,381
I'm supposed to be here.

380
00:34:42,481 --> 00:34:44,383
I live here, you know.

381
00:34:44,483 --> 00:34:47,853
How could you stay after
all that's happened here?

382
00:34:47,953 --> 00:34:50,122
There's nowhere else to go.

383
00:34:50,222 --> 00:34:52,924
I've been hearing that
my whole fucking life.

384
00:34:53,024 --> 00:34:55,894
I never want to hear that again.

385
00:34:55,994 --> 00:34:57,796
So where do you want to go?

386
00:34:57,896 --> 00:34:58,897
Out of here.

387
00:34:58,997 --> 00:35:01,133
This place depresses me.

388
00:35:01,233 --> 00:35:06,372
Is there someplace where we can
go where they can't get at me?

389
00:35:06,472 --> 00:35:07,173
The backyard.

390
00:35:36,168 --> 00:35:37,536
Shit.

391
00:35:37,636 --> 00:35:39,538
Walls everywhere.

392
00:35:39,638 --> 00:35:40,539
Nowhere to run.

393
00:36:14,506 --> 00:36:15,907
Suspect is in the backyard.

394
00:36:36,428 --> 00:36:37,296
Come on.

395
00:36:37,396 --> 00:36:38,096
Move.

396
00:36:56,915 --> 00:36:58,950
Where the hell did he go.

397
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:00,819
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

398
00:37:19,838 --> 00:37:20,539
Ah.

399
00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:21,540
There you are.

400
00:37:29,581 --> 00:37:30,482
Shit.

401
00:37:30,582 --> 00:37:31,483
Too many trees.

402
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:14,760
We don't want it
to go off, do we?

403
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:16,194
Can we put it away?

404
00:38:23,935 --> 00:38:26,037
You'll never regret the
moment you saved my tongue.

405
00:38:31,042 --> 00:38:32,378
Then don't use it to talk.

406
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:40,185
RESSLER (ON RADIO): Sniper One.

407
00:38:40,285 --> 00:38:40,986
Sniper One.

408
00:38:41,086 --> 00:38:41,953
Come in, Sniper One.

409
00:38:42,053 --> 00:38:43,622
What's your status?

410
00:38:43,722 --> 00:38:44,456
Fuck.

411
00:38:44,556 --> 00:38:47,593
Sir, I just missed the target.

412
00:38:47,693 --> 00:38:51,196
These fuckers think they
got me, but they're wrong.

413
00:38:51,296 --> 00:38:52,464
I'm only starting, for real.

414
00:38:58,003 --> 00:39:00,038
Mmm.

415
00:39:00,138 --> 00:39:00,839
Right.

416
00:39:13,284 --> 00:39:15,120
What are you doing, Ella?

417
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:17,523
What the hell are you doing?

418
00:39:17,623 --> 00:39:19,224
Stop it.

419
00:39:19,324 --> 00:39:20,692
Stop it, you crazy bitch.

420
00:39:20,792 --> 00:39:22,828
Stop it or I'll
blow your head off.

421
00:39:22,928 --> 00:39:23,862
Back to the room.

422
00:39:23,962 --> 00:39:24,663
Now.

423
00:39:26,765 --> 00:39:28,467
RESSLER (ON RADIO): Have you
any idea what's going on?

424
00:39:28,567 --> 00:39:31,002
I don't think we've seen the
last of the crazy shit today,

425
00:39:31,102 --> 00:39:31,803
Sir.

426
00:39:58,597 --> 00:40:00,265
Police officer is entering
the house through one

427
00:40:00,365 --> 00:40:01,066
Of the attic windows.

428
00:40:05,504 --> 00:40:08,306
[Rustling noise]

429
00:40:09,841 --> 00:40:12,711
Oh, no, you're not going
to take me like that.

430
00:40:12,811 --> 00:40:13,545
Die, you motherfucker!

431
00:40:13,645 --> 00:40:16,682
[Gunshot] [gunshot] Die!

432
00:40:16,782 --> 00:40:17,649
Die!

433
00:40:17,749 --> 00:40:20,018
[Gunshot] Die!

434
00:40:20,118 --> 00:40:21,152
Die! [Gunshot]

435
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:21,953
No!

436
00:40:22,053 --> 00:40:22,754
No!

437
00:40:26,091 --> 00:40:26,858
Die!

438
00:40:26,958 --> 00:40:28,159
Die!

439
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:29,127
Die, you motherfucker!

440
00:40:29,227 --> 00:40:29,928
[Screaming] No!

441
00:40:30,028 --> 00:40:31,062
You'll never get me.

442
00:40:31,162 --> 00:40:32,531
I [inaudible].

443
00:40:32,631 --> 00:40:33,965
You'll never get me.

444
00:40:34,065 --> 00:40:34,933
You hear that, Ressler?

445
00:40:35,033 --> 00:40:37,335
You'll never get me!

446
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:41,139
[Gunshots]

447
00:40:41,239 --> 00:40:42,741
I've lost track of the
intruding police officer.

448
00:40:42,841 --> 00:40:43,542
WOMAN: No!

449
00:40:56,254 --> 00:40:58,824
No!

450
00:40:58,924 --> 00:40:59,625
No!

451
00:41:02,694 --> 00:41:04,596
No!

452
00:41:04,696 --> 00:41:07,566
[Screaming]

453
00:41:35,026 --> 00:41:37,362
When is your father going to
do something about that door?

454
00:41:37,462 --> 00:41:40,932
Soon it won't open at all.

455
00:41:41,032 --> 00:41:42,801
Oh my god, my feet
are killing me.

456
00:41:45,837 --> 00:41:48,707
And where's that worthless
housekeeper, anyway?

457
00:41:52,443 --> 00:41:53,579
Ella has her qualities.

458
00:41:53,679 --> 00:41:56,147
She's not just the housekeeper.

459
00:41:56,247 --> 00:41:57,148
WOMAN: Yeah.

460
00:41:57,248 --> 00:41:58,283
You're way too friendly
with that girl.

461
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:04,723
[Gasps]

462
00:42:13,431 --> 00:42:14,132
Leer!

463
00:42:14,232 --> 00:42:15,300
Leer!
Leer!

464
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,101
Steven!

465
00:42:16,201 --> 00:42:17,102
Where the hell are you both?

466
00:42:17,202 --> 00:42:19,070
Answer me, for Christ's sake!

467
00:42:22,841 --> 00:42:23,541
Ahh!

468
00:42:23,642 --> 00:42:24,342
GIRL: [inaudible].

469
00:42:24,442 --> 00:42:25,811
Mother, [inaudible]?

470
00:42:25,911 --> 00:42:27,312
Mother, don't!

471
00:42:27,412 --> 00:42:28,980
Ahh!

472
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:29,781
Ahh!

473
00:42:34,085 --> 00:42:34,786
Ahh!

[Screaming]

475
00:42:45,363 --> 00:42:47,465
Mother!

476
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:48,266
Shit.

477
00:42:48,366 --> 00:42:50,435
The fucking door won't open!

478
00:42:50,535 --> 00:42:51,236
Dad!

479
00:42:51,336 --> 00:42:52,437
Dad! Where the fuck are you?

480
00:42:52,537 --> 00:42:53,438
Help us!
Help us!

00:42:55,841 --> 00:42:58,243
Help us!

484
00:42:58,343 --> 00:42:59,444
Dad, help us!

485
00:42:59,544 --> 00:43:00,245
For Heaven's sake!

486
00:43:10,822 --> 00:43:13,692
Ahh!

487
00:43:13,792 --> 00:43:17,696
Come on, Mother.

488
00:43:17,796 --> 00:43:21,199
[Moaning]

489
00:43:21,299 --> 00:43:23,201
Dad!

490
00:43:23,301 --> 00:43:25,170
Dad!

491
00:43:25,270 --> 00:43:26,672
Dad!

492
00:43:26,772 --> 00:43:28,674
Where are you?

493
00:43:28,774 --> 00:43:30,676
Dad!

494
00:43:30,776 --> 00:43:33,178
[Screaming]

495
00:43:47,225 --> 00:43:49,127
Oh, shit.

496
00:43:49,227 --> 00:43:50,628
We have to go back.

497
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:30,535
Mother, shut the fuck up!

498
00:44:30,635 --> 00:44:34,039
[Moaning]

499
00:44:42,113 --> 00:44:43,081
Oh god.

500
00:44:43,181 --> 00:44:43,882
Ahh!

501
00:44:50,889 --> 00:44:51,790
You.

502
00:44:51,890 --> 00:44:53,258
Mother, don't!

503
00:44:53,358 --> 00:44:54,259
Ella, don't!

504
00:44:57,495 --> 00:44:58,196
Ahh!

505
00:45:23,154 --> 00:45:24,155
Ahh.

506
00:45:24,255 --> 00:45:24,956
Ahh.

507
00:45:31,229 --> 00:45:31,930
[Inaudible].

508
00:45:41,506 --> 00:45:44,910
You always liked me, huh?

509
00:45:45,010 --> 00:45:50,882
You always treated me as part
of the family, didn't you?

510
00:45:50,982 --> 00:45:53,384
And now you're dying.

511
00:45:53,484 --> 00:45:58,389
And you don't
deserve that, do you?

512
00:45:58,489 --> 00:46:02,861
And all I ever wanted was
to be part of your family.

513
00:46:08,967 --> 00:46:16,341
But from now on, I will take
care of you and your family.

514
00:46:16,441 --> 00:46:20,378
I'll be the caretaker
of the house.

515
00:46:20,478 --> 00:46:27,318
I promise you that I will
lead you and your family

516
00:46:27,418 --> 00:46:32,357
Through the frontiers
of death until the world

517
00:46:32,457 --> 00:46:36,261
Of eternal light.

518
00:46:36,361 --> 00:46:37,728
Your heart is still beating.

519
00:46:41,732 --> 00:46:43,101
You're dead now.

520
00:46:49,074 --> 00:46:57,115
It's time for you and
your family to follow me...

521
00:46:57,215 --> 00:47:00,618
One happy family beyond death.

522
00:47:12,197 --> 00:47:15,100
[Screaming] No!

523
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:18,103
No!

524
00:47:18,203 --> 00:47:20,605
No!

525
00:47:20,705 --> 00:47:22,773
No!

526
00:47:22,874 --> 00:47:23,574
No!

527
00:47:28,379 --> 00:47:29,080
Ahh!

528
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:33,051
No!

529
00:48:23,068 --> 00:48:23,969
Oh my god.

530
00:49:27,432 --> 00:49:28,333
What are you doing?

531
00:49:37,908 --> 00:49:38,809
Who are you?

532
00:50:01,766 --> 00:50:02,467
Oh, Jesus.

533
00:50:02,567 --> 00:50:03,268
That's disgusting.

534
00:51:04,562 --> 00:51:05,696
We lost contact
with our man inside,

535
00:51:05,796 --> 00:51:08,733
And our sniper lost visual, too.

536
00:51:08,833 --> 00:51:10,701
What should we do now?

537
00:51:10,801 --> 00:51:16,374
Prepare for assault.

538
00:51:16,474 --> 00:51:17,175
You're insane.

539
00:51:24,382 --> 00:51:27,185
Don't look at me like that.

540
00:51:27,285 --> 00:51:30,621
Stop, or I'll blow your
fucking brains out.

541
00:51:40,565 --> 00:51:42,433
Stop this.

542
00:51:42,533 --> 00:51:44,269
Oh, god, Ella.

543
00:51:44,369 --> 00:51:46,437
Stop it.

544
00:51:46,537 --> 00:51:48,773
Obey me, for Christ sakes.

545
00:51:48,873 --> 00:51:49,574
Obey me!

546
00:51:54,845 --> 00:51:55,680
No.

547
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:58,283
You obey me.

548
00:51:58,383 --> 00:52:01,118
You're no longer in
control of things.

549
00:52:01,219 --> 00:52:02,387
Do you hear me?

550
00:52:02,487 --> 00:52:04,088
You obey me.

551
00:52:04,189 --> 00:52:05,356
You obey me!

552
00:52:05,456 --> 00:52:08,659
You obey me.

553
00:52:08,759 --> 00:52:11,929
[Laugh] Do you hear me?

554
00:52:12,029 --> 00:52:16,601
[Laugh] My time has come.

555
00:52:16,701 --> 00:52:19,870
[Laugh] Yeah.

556
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:23,574
Now you'll see who's
in control around here.

557
00:52:23,674 --> 00:52:26,411
You too will become
part of the family.

558
00:52:26,511 --> 00:52:28,746
[Laugh] Yeah.

559
00:52:28,846 --> 00:52:31,449
You will obey me.

560
00:52:31,549 --> 00:52:33,918
[Laugh]

561
00:52:52,870 --> 00:52:54,339

01:15:56,820 --> 01:15:57,687
Ah.

759
01:15:57,787 --> 01:15:59,122
No!

760
01:15:59,222 --> 01:16:02,125
[Inaudible], you
ugly son of a bitch!

761
01:16:02,225 --> 01:16:04,127
After all I did to
correct my mistake,

762
01:16:04,227 --> 01:16:07,096
And now you let me down!

763
01:16:07,196 --> 01:16:08,097
You betrayed me.

764
01:16:08,197 --> 01:16:09,098
Do you hear me?

765
01:16:09,198 --> 01:16:10,099
You betrayed me.

766
01:16:13,169 --> 01:16:15,571
You [inaudible] regret, now.

767
01:16:15,672 --> 01:16:18,074
I don't want to be part
of your bloody family.

768
01:16:22,646 --> 01:16:24,247
I want [inaudible].

769
01:16:24,347 --> 01:16:25,048
Ah.

770
01:16:41,564 --> 01:16:44,467
[Moaning]

771
01:17:12,561 --> 01:17:13,963
Ahh.

772
01:17:14,063 --> 01:17:15,932
Ahh.

773
01:17:16,032 --> 01:17:17,400
Ahh!

774
01:17:17,500 --> 01:17:21,370
[Moaning]

775
01:17:40,423 --> 01:17:41,124
Ahh.

776
01:17:52,601 --> 01:17:54,537
You won't need a
new haircut anymore.

777
01:18:04,247 --> 01:18:07,083
Oh, shit.

778
01:18:07,183 --> 01:18:09,552
Where is that son of a bitch?

779
01:18:14,057 --> 01:18:14,958
Hmm.

780
01:18:15,058 --> 01:18:19,595
A thinner acid...
Just what I need

781
01:18:19,695 --> 01:18:21,064
For that stupid living painting.

782
01:18:47,090 --> 01:18:48,024
Ah.
Oh.

783
01:18:48,124 --> 01:18:49,025
Ahh.

784
01:18:49,125 --> 01:18:50,693
You son of a bitch!

785
01:18:50,794 --> 01:18:51,494
Ahh.

786
01:18:56,265 --> 01:18:56,966
Ahh.

787
01:19:07,476 --> 01:19:11,347
[Laugh]

788
01:20:07,670 --> 01:20:08,371
Oh, no.

789
01:20:08,471 --> 01:20:09,372
Not this one.

790
01:20:13,442 --> 01:20:15,811
[Drill sounds]

791
01:20:17,413 --> 01:20:21,784
I'm really getting
tired of this.

792
01:20:21,885 --> 01:20:24,787
[Drill sounds]

793
01:20:30,826 --> 01:20:31,727
Ah.

794
01:20:31,827 --> 01:20:33,696
Ahh!

795
01:20:33,796 --> 01:20:35,198
Ah.

796
01:20:35,298 --> 01:20:38,167
Ahh.

797
01:20:38,267 --> 01:20:40,669
[Moaning]

798
01:20:40,769 --> 01:20:42,838
I've really had enough of you.

799
01:20:49,879 --> 01:20:50,947
These tools really
came in handy.

800
01:20:54,050 --> 01:20:55,451
Now, cleaning time.

801
01:22:21,637 --> 01:22:23,339
Hi.

802
01:22:23,439 --> 01:22:25,508
Do I know you?
