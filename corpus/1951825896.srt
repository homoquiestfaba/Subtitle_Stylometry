2
00:01:02,162 --> 00:01:03,652
- Dad?
- Yeah?

3
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:05,321
The water's green.

4
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:09,960
No, it's fluorescent.

5
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,334
- What's...
- Fluorescent.

6
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:18,276
Fluorescent means "lit from within."

7
00:01:20,213 --> 00:01:22,113
So am I fluorescent?

8
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:27,946
Yeah, Dory, you are.

9
00:01:51,344 --> 00:01:53,039
It's okay, honey.

10
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,988
Why has Grandma
been sleeping all day?

11
00:02:05,358 --> 00:02:07,758
Well, she's sedated, sweetie.

12
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:12,027
I don't know
what that word means, Mom.

13
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:18,036
It means that she's been taking pills
so she can sleep.

14
00:02:22,609 --> 00:02:24,702
She lost her son, Harper.

15
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:29,571
There's nothing more painful
in the whole wide world.

16
00:02:30,617 --> 00:02:32,744
More than losing your dad?

17
00:02:34,921 --> 00:02:36,183
Different.

18
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:41,226
Different.

19
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:13,956
- Cousin Laura's coming.
- Really? Why?

20
00:03:14,093 --> 00:03:17,028
I haven't spoken to her in over 10 years.

21
00:03:21,668 --> 00:03:23,693
That's Brian's computer.

22
00:03:27,774 --> 00:03:30,937
I can't go in there, so can you...

23
00:03:31,077 --> 00:03:34,137
Okay. Okay. It's okay. I got it.

24
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:48,989
Who is "Snakes290"?

25
00:03:49,128 --> 00:03:50,561
Oh, God.

26
00:03:50,663 --> 00:03:55,600
He's an old college friend of Brian's
that now lives in Michigan.

27
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:56,896
What does it say?

28
00:03:57,003 --> 00:04:00,962
He said, "What do you think of
the Sonics' new power forward?"

29
00:04:04,177 --> 00:04:06,509
Well, what did he think of them?

30
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,907
He thought he was a good rebounder,

31
00:04:09,015 --> 00:04:11,984
but his outside jumper
needed some work.

32
00:04:12,118 --> 00:04:13,745
Then write that.

33
00:04:19,659 --> 00:04:22,093
All right. I can do that.

34
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:30,859
Shit!

35
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:32,528
- What? What? What?
- Shit!

36
00:04:32,672 --> 00:04:33,866
What's wrong, Audrey?

37
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:36,305
- I forgot to tell somebody.
- Who?

38
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:39,173
Neal, can you take me down to Renton?

39
00:04:39,312 --> 00:04:42,645
- Renton? You can't call?
- No, he doesn't have a phone.

40
00:04:42,749 --> 00:04:44,011
Who doesn't have a phone, sweetie?

41
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:47,642
- Can you take me?
- No, honey! Come on, now!

42
00:04:47,754 --> 00:04:51,713
Okay, it's okay. It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay. It's all right. It's all right.

43
00:04:51,858 --> 00:04:53,223
I can go.

44
00:04:53,993 --> 00:04:55,790
Look, right around here from...

45
00:04:55,895 --> 00:05:00,559
There's his address book,
and look up a Jerry Sunborne.

46
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,668
Who's Jerry Sunborne, darling?

47
00:05:03,903 --> 00:05:06,235
Who the hell is Jerry Sunborne?

48
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:42,872
You want something to eat?

49
00:05:42,975 --> 00:05:44,670
No, I'm fine. I'm fine.

50
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:09,730
I just couldn't...

51
00:06:12,271 --> 00:06:15,138
- Do you have another one of those?
- Yeah.

52
00:06:16,442 --> 00:06:17,773
Thank you.

53
00:06:27,687 --> 00:06:30,053
I'm Howard Glassman.

54
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:32,250
I'm Jerry.

55
00:06:34,861 --> 00:06:36,920
How did you know Brian?

56
00:06:38,097 --> 00:06:39,894
We grew up together.

57
00:06:43,102 --> 00:06:48,233
I just live down the street
and financed some of his deals...

58
00:06:52,945 --> 00:06:55,072
- Oh, no.
- I'm sorry.

59
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:57,274
Well, I'm...

60
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:00,781
My wife.

61
00:07:01,854 --> 00:07:04,254
It's nice to meet you, Jerry.

62
00:07:05,491 --> 00:07:07,891
So you started smoking again?

63
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,640
Come on! Get out of the way!

64
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:34,582
All right! I bet you I could jump over it!

65
00:07:34,687 --> 00:07:36,348
I'm gonna jump over it!

66
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:42,024
You don't know?

67
00:07:42,161 --> 00:07:44,789
I guess your brain's
growing up too small.

68
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:49,332
- Hey.
- Hello. Hi.

69
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,027
Hi. I'm David.

70
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:54,003
My name is Jerry. You're Harper.

71
00:07:54,841 --> 00:07:56,138
- Yeah.
- Hi.

72
00:07:56,242 --> 00:07:58,301
- Hi.
- Dory.

73
00:08:06,552 --> 00:08:08,816
Your dad was my best friend.

74
00:08:11,257 --> 00:08:12,485
When?

75
00:08:15,561 --> 00:08:18,189
When I was your age, and last week.

76
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:29,402
<i>Strawberry Fields Forever
is your favorite song.</i>

77
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:33,171
And Dory's got that scar on his nose

78
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,214
'cause he was running and he thought
the screen door was open.

79
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:38,044
But it was closed.

80
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:40,311
Everybody knows that, Dory.

81
00:08:41,053 --> 00:08:43,044
You don't like mimes.
They scare you.

82
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:45,157
They don't talk.

83
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:47,852
Yeah, that's what they do.

84
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:51,692
Your suit is a little big.

85
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:55,826
Thank you.

86
00:08:55,935 --> 00:08:58,233
That was imprudent of you.

87
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,396
I bet you can't do this.

88
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:05,436
Fast.

89
00:09:38,778 --> 00:09:40,541
- Hi.
- Hey, Jerry.

90
00:09:42,782 --> 00:09:44,306
I'm so sorry.

91
00:09:50,356 --> 00:09:52,085
Thanks for coming.

92
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:53,750
I'm really glad you came.

93
00:09:53,859 --> 00:09:57,317
I wasn't so sure
you would actually come,

94
00:09:57,463 --> 00:09:59,590
- so, thank you.
- No problem.

95
00:10:05,037 --> 00:10:06,561
I hated you.

96
00:10:13,846 --> 00:10:16,906
I hated you for so many years, Jerry.

97
00:10:17,016 --> 00:10:18,574
It's all right.

98
00:10:19,151 --> 00:10:22,643
And now, it just all seems so silly.

99
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:31,257
He was so loyal to a fault, you know.

100
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:37,528
Most people would've given up on you.
Hell, I would've.

101
00:10:41,407 --> 00:10:42,965
But he didn't.

102
00:10:47,513 --> 00:10:48,707
I know.

103
00:10:54,387 --> 00:10:55,684
I'm gonna go.

104
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:57,482
No, I... Wait.

105
00:10:58,557 --> 00:11:00,718
I need you to stay.

106
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:03,829
Please, can you just stay for a little bit?

107
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:06,557
- Sure.
- Just a little bit?

108
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:09,395
Sure. Sure.

109
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:12,528
Good.

110
00:11:20,713 --> 00:11:22,578
So Brian is maybe six years old,

111
00:11:22,715 --> 00:11:25,650
and we're the Andersons' guests
at Flathead Country Club,

112
00:11:25,751 --> 00:11:27,343
and we're swimming in the pool,

113
00:11:27,453 --> 00:11:29,421
and all of the sudden,
Brian gets out of the water

114
00:11:29,555 --> 00:11:32,683
and he pulls his bathing suit down
and he takes a piss right in the pool.

115
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:35,920
And people are just freaking out.

116
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:38,053
June Anderson is freaking out.

117
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:40,427
People are going,
"What are you doing?"

118
00:11:40,566 --> 00:11:43,831
I mean, he's peeing right in the pool
like it's a urinal, so...

119
00:11:43,936 --> 00:11:45,563
Wow.

120
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:49,334
And when it was over I say,
"Brian, why did you do that?"

121
00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:52,002
You know, I mean, he wasn't a bad kid.

122
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:54,579
He never acted out.
He's quiet, you know.

123
00:11:55,748 --> 00:12:00,412
And I said...
Okay, I'm totally messing this story up!

124
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:05,379
I said, "Why'd you..." Shut up!

125
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:07,891
I said, "Why did you do that?"

126
00:12:07,993 --> 00:12:11,019
And he came back with something
that made no sense.

127
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:15,226
Shit. I forget what he said.
It was so funny. Shoot.

128
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:17,859
He said he didn't want
to get his bathing suit wet.

129
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:20,871
Yes! That was it!

130
00:12:20,973 --> 00:12:24,739
"I didn't want...
I didn't want to get my bathing suit wet!"

131
00:12:24,844 --> 00:12:26,368
That's okay!

132
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:29,141
He was a little retarded as a kid,
you know.

133
00:12:29,281 --> 00:12:34,150
No, I'm sorry, but he was. He was...
He was slow, you know.

134
00:12:34,286 --> 00:12:37,653
And, you know,
he came around eventually.

135
00:12:50,836 --> 00:12:52,167
We home?

136
00:13:02,848 --> 00:13:04,839
Don't let them grow up.

137
00:13:32,411 --> 00:13:38,111
How about I make us some pasta?
Open the wine.

138
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:44,145
That way our vacation won't have to end
till tomorrow.

139
00:13:48,694 --> 00:13:50,355
When I get back.

140
00:13:51,363 --> 00:13:53,957
- No. No, Brian...
- I have to.

141
00:13:54,066 --> 00:13:55,397
- Why?
- It's his birthday.

142
00:13:55,534 --> 00:13:56,558
So?

143
00:13:56,702 --> 00:13:58,863
Audrey, you didn't know him
when he was a kid. He was special.

144
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:00,130
Every time you leave here, Brian,

145
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:01,729
I'm scared to death
you're not gonna come back.

146
00:14:01,874 --> 00:14:04,399
Oh, Jesus,
just stop being so damn dramatic.

147
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:06,477
You stop being so damn naive.

148
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:08,638
Audrey, it's his birthday.

149
00:14:08,747 --> 00:14:12,080
Who the hell knows
how many more he's gonna have?

150
00:14:18,724 --> 00:14:20,021
Mom?

151
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:27,619
- Hey, Jay.
- Hey.

152
00:15:28,727 --> 00:15:30,251
Happy Birthday!

153
00:15:30,362 --> 00:15:31,954
- August 3rd.
- August 3rd.

154
00:15:32,064 --> 00:15:33,497
Yeah.

155
00:15:33,632 --> 00:15:36,499
- You're an old man.
- Yeah.

156
00:15:36,635 --> 00:15:38,535
Come on in. Come on in.

157
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:41,606
- She okay?
- Yeah, she's fine. Have a seat.

158
00:15:46,312 --> 00:15:49,247
I'm hungry.
You want to get something to eat?

159
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:51,441
- Yeah. Cool.
- Yeah? Let's go out.

160
00:15:52,084 --> 00:15:53,881
- They got coffee, strawberry...
- No coffee. Strawberry.

161
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:56,510
- Strawberry?
- Yeah.

162
00:15:56,655 --> 00:15:59,715
- Will you try and find some soup?
- Okay.

163
00:15:59,858 --> 00:16:01,450
So they're not happy with the work,
you know?

164
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:04,188
I think I'm gonna fire the workers.

165
00:16:06,398 --> 00:16:08,832
And Audrey's fucking someone else.

166
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:11,830
Are you checking to see if I'm listening?

167
00:16:11,937 --> 00:16:13,802
No, man. You don't understand.

168
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:19,003
This woman looks so good there is
no way that she is only fucking me.

169
00:16:19,111 --> 00:16:20,976
Our neighbor's this guy
named Landon Hicks.

170
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,742
He's this rugged,
mountain-man type guy.

171
00:16:23,882 --> 00:16:28,319
Big beard. Big hair. Doesn't even talk.

172
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:30,581
She's in love with Landon Hicks!

173
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:32,884
Well, you gotta take
the good with the bad.

174
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:34,856
What's the good?

175
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,690
Are you still...

176
00:16:37,796 --> 00:16:39,195
Yes, I am.

177
00:16:43,535 --> 00:16:45,730
I mean, you're still in the rotation,
you know what I'm saying?

178
00:16:46,872 --> 00:16:49,773
You know,
you gotta accept the good, man,

179
00:16:49,908 --> 00:16:52,172
'cause they're gonna
make you accept the bad.

180
00:16:52,277 --> 00:16:55,041
You have everything
any man would want.

181
00:16:55,147 --> 00:16:58,378
Accept the good, Bri.
You have what I'll never have.

182
00:16:58,484 --> 00:17:01,544
Oh, come on, don't talk
like that about yourself, all right?

183
00:17:01,653 --> 00:17:05,953
Brian, you're my only real friend
left in the world, you know that?

184
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:14,594
Audrey angry
you came to see me tonight?

185
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:16,759
No.

186
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:21,098
Yes.

187
00:17:22,841 --> 00:17:26,072
I don't know why you're so dead set
against seeing her again.

188
00:17:26,178 --> 00:17:30,137
Well, I don't want to see anybody
until I'm clean. That's why.

189
00:17:37,122 --> 00:17:40,455
So, the Fed raised rates.
Is that gonna affect you?

190
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:44,460
No, people will still buy.
This refi boom's got good legs.

191
00:17:44,596 --> 00:17:45,893
Good.

192
00:18:30,709 --> 00:18:31,869
Yeah?

193
00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:34,472
Jerry?

194
00:18:35,247 --> 00:18:38,307
Maybe. Who is it?

195
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:40,885
I'm Audrey Burke's brother, Neal.

196
00:18:48,193 --> 00:18:50,184
Can you open the door, please?

197
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:51,387
Yeah.

198
00:19:02,908 --> 00:19:04,136
Yeah.

199
00:19:06,745 --> 00:19:07,973
Yeah?

200
00:19:09,948 --> 00:19:11,677
Brian is dead.

201
00:19:12,584 --> 00:19:13,846
He was killed.

202
00:19:13,952 --> 00:19:17,080
Somebody killed him, and he's dead.

203
00:19:19,358 --> 00:19:21,918
What the fuck are you talking about?

204
00:19:23,462 --> 00:19:24,929
He's dead.

205
00:19:31,103 --> 00:19:33,162
Are you fucking with me?

206
00:19:34,273 --> 00:19:37,902
Some guy was beating up on his wife
and Brian...

207
00:19:41,246 --> 00:19:42,372
What?

208
00:19:43,282 --> 00:19:44,840
Brian's dead.

209
00:19:46,752 --> 00:19:48,583
The funeral is today.

210
00:19:55,794 --> 00:19:58,422
I'm here to take you to the funeral.

211
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:06,499
You better not be fucking with me, man.

212
00:20:12,477 --> 00:20:14,570
Do you have a suit?

213
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,580
Yeah, I got a suit.

214
00:20:25,824 --> 00:20:28,088
At this time,
on behalf of the Burke family,

215
00:20:28,193 --> 00:20:34,098
I'd like to thank those of you who have
been able to spend this time with us.

216
00:20:34,199 --> 00:20:36,190
Many of you
have traveled a long distance,

217
00:20:36,335 --> 00:20:38,269
and it is much appreciated.

218
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:42,534
In a few moments, we'll be going
to the Burke residence for the reception.

219
00:20:50,382 --> 00:20:53,613
Okay? Okay.

220
00:21:33,692 --> 00:21:37,253
Hey, what about chicken, Harper?
You can eat chicken, can't you?

221
00:21:37,396 --> 00:21:40,024
Chickens are animals, Dad.
I don't eat animals.

222
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:41,258
Since when?

223
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,062
- Since meat is murder.
- No more meat, honey.

224
00:21:44,202 --> 00:21:45,726
- Dad?
- Meat is murder.

225
00:21:45,871 --> 00:21:47,099
- Dad?
- Basically.

226
00:21:47,239 --> 00:21:48,399
- Daddy?
- Where did you learn this?

227
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:50,667
I know things.
Not everything I know was learned.

228
00:21:50,776 --> 00:21:51,868
- Well, actually, that's not true.
- Dad!

229
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:53,604
The nature of knowledge
is that you learned it somewhere.

230
00:21:53,745 --> 00:21:54,939
- Dad!
- Yes?

231
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,105
- I like meat.
- I know you do.

232
00:21:57,249 --> 00:21:58,682
He likes meat, Harper.

233
00:21:58,784 --> 00:21:59,876
And he's gonna get bigger than you.

234
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:01,680
She does eat broccoli.

235
00:22:01,787 --> 00:22:03,778
- I see.
- Don't you, baby?

236
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:08,721
Did you take 60 bucks
out of the car, babe?

237
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:10,590
No.

238
00:22:10,729 --> 00:22:13,095
That's funny, 'cause I had
three $20s in the ashtray,

239
00:22:13,231 --> 00:22:14,255
and now they're gone.

240
00:22:14,399 --> 00:22:16,230
No. I didn't take it.

241
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:25,208
Was your friend in the car
the other night?

242
00:22:26,745 --> 00:22:28,235
He didn't take it.

243
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:30,247
- Who?
- He wouldn't take it.

244
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:31,976
Who? Who wouldn't take it?

245
00:22:32,117 --> 00:22:34,608
- Would you wake up, Brian?
- Nobody.

246
00:22:34,753 --> 00:22:35,981
Wake up!

247
00:22:39,091 --> 00:22:40,820
- Wake up!
- All right.

248
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:43,490
- Mom, who?
- Jesus.

249
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:49,994
Meat is so murder! Get her! Get her!

250
00:22:50,135 --> 00:22:51,898
- Get her.
- Well, it is.

251
00:22:54,306 --> 00:22:55,568
Yeah, come in.

252
00:22:55,674 --> 00:22:58,336
Yeah, I know.
I can't stay. I gotta take off.

253
00:22:58,477 --> 00:22:59,774
Oh, okay.

254
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:02,574
Well, it was very nice
hanging out with you.

255
00:23:02,681 --> 00:23:05,809
You know I appreciate it
more than you know, man.

256
00:23:05,951 --> 00:23:08,078
- Well...
- Really.

257
00:23:08,186 --> 00:23:10,313
- Happy birthday, man.
- Okay.

258
00:23:12,691 --> 00:23:14,488
All right.

259
00:23:14,626 --> 00:23:17,459
- It's good to see you.
- Take care.

260
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:19,757
Hey, don't forget the...

261
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:22,360
Don't forget what?

262
00:23:22,501 --> 00:23:24,765
- Groceries.
- What?

263
00:23:33,311 --> 00:23:34,676
Hey, pretty boy.

264
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:33,164
It's way past her bedtime.

265
00:24:35,574 --> 00:24:40,409
Oh, no, you're not watching
that Lifetime movie again, are you?

266
00:24:40,545 --> 00:24:42,410
It's this commercial we just saw.

267
00:24:42,547 --> 00:24:44,344
You're crying over a commercial?

268
00:24:44,449 --> 00:24:47,941
Do you have any idea what they're doing
to baby seals in Alaska, honey?

269
00:24:48,086 --> 00:24:51,453
They were so cute, Dad.
Please, give them a lot of money.

270
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:52,579
I wrote down the Web site.

271
00:24:52,724 --> 00:24:54,783
- We need to make a really big donation.
- Okay. Okay, good.

272
00:24:54,926 --> 00:24:56,393
Harper, out.

273
00:24:57,829 --> 00:24:58,853
Out.

274
00:25:00,565 --> 00:25:03,193
- Good night, honey.
- Good night, Mom.

275
00:25:04,135 --> 00:25:05,625
Seal hater.

276
00:25:10,942 --> 00:25:13,467
Seal hater. Nice to meet you.

277
00:25:13,612 --> 00:25:15,580
I'm gonna go wash up.

278
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:26,191
So how was he?

279
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:26,885
So how was he?

280
00:25:27,926 --> 00:25:30,087
He's all fucked up, Audrey.

281
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:33,660
All fucked up.

282
00:25:33,798 --> 00:25:38,667
You know, he said this thing to me,
didn't strike me until I was driving home.

283
00:25:38,803 --> 00:25:41,397
He asked me if the Feds raising
the rates would affect my business.

284
00:25:41,506 --> 00:25:43,906
Now, that has no relevance for Jerry
in his world, right?

285
00:25:44,009 --> 00:25:45,806
He would have read it somewhere
and just remembered it

286
00:25:45,911 --> 00:25:48,277
because he knew
it had relevance for me, you see?

287
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,642
And I know that you think I just go there

288
00:25:49,781 --> 00:25:52,443
and I give, and I give, and he just takes,

289
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:53,677
but, you know, he's my friend.

290
00:25:53,818 --> 00:25:56,446
He looks out for me, you understand?

291
00:25:56,955 --> 00:25:58,479
He's my friend.

292
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:00,350
Okay.

293
00:26:14,706 --> 00:26:16,936
You know, they forgot to put
the dimmers on the lights.

294
00:26:17,042 --> 00:26:21,308
I am gonna fire those guys,
and I'm gonna go with the Polish guys.

295
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:33,550
You're taking the kids swimming
at Howard's tomorrow.

296
00:26:33,692 --> 00:26:36,490
All right. Dory's putting his head under.

297
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:39,860
- Go easy on him, baby.
- Even if I have to push it.

298
00:26:39,998 --> 00:26:41,829
Well, that's nice.

299
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:46,203
I told Jerry
you were fucking Landon Hicks.

300
00:26:47,372 --> 00:26:48,737
You what?

301
00:26:50,709 --> 00:26:53,507
- Landon Hicks?
- He knows I was joking.

302
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:57,048
- Why would I be fucking Landon Hicks?
- I don't know.

303
00:26:57,349 --> 00:26:58,577
If I was gonna sleep with somebody

304
00:26:58,717 --> 00:27:01,242
it sure as hell
wouldn't be Landon Hicks.

305
00:27:01,386 --> 00:27:02,910
No? Why not?

306
00:27:03,054 --> 00:27:06,353
Because he doesn't speak. That's why.

307
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:08,354
Who would it be?

308
00:27:15,734 --> 00:27:17,258
The water guy.

309
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:19,735
The water guy?

310
00:27:20,572 --> 00:27:21,596
Why?

311
00:27:22,907 --> 00:27:24,033
Because.

312
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:26,337
Why the water guy?

313
00:27:26,444 --> 00:27:30,107
'Cause he reminds me of a cowboy.

314
00:27:30,782 --> 00:27:33,012
The guy that brings
the Arrowhead water

315
00:27:33,118 --> 00:27:35,609
reminds you of a cowboy.

316
00:27:35,754 --> 00:27:37,221
Oh, yeah.

317
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:43,252
Shouldn't have asked
if you didn't want to know.

318
00:27:45,063 --> 00:27:47,122
Come on. Do it.

319
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,624
Okay, do it.

320
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:53,599
Please do it.

321
00:27:56,307 --> 00:27:57,706
Come here.

322
00:28:00,278 --> 00:28:01,609
That's it.

323
00:28:20,131 --> 00:28:21,655
You guys need anything?

324
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,563
No, thanks, Howard.
You gonna come in?

325
00:28:23,668 --> 00:28:26,102
- He doesn't swim.
- Okay.

326
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:29,435
Who spends $200,000
on a swimming pool and doesn't swim?

327
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:30,769
All right, Doris, that's enough.

328
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:33,571
Maybe next time,
you'll try building a mosque.

329
00:28:33,978 --> 00:28:37,436
That's funny.
We'll be back in a couple of hours.

330
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:39,608
- One, two, three.
- Two...

331
00:28:43,855 --> 00:28:46,847
- What happened?
- I don't feel like it.

332
00:28:46,991 --> 00:28:49,755
He's just being difficult
for the attention, Dad.

333
00:28:49,861 --> 00:28:50,953
Thank you, Dr. Freud.

334
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:53,530
Why don't you go touch the drain
or something?

335
00:28:53,665 --> 00:28:55,428
Now, look, Dory, just try.

336
00:28:55,533 --> 00:28:57,660
- I already did!
- No, you didn't.

337
00:28:57,802 --> 00:28:59,599
Now, look, you got to face your fears.

338
00:28:59,704 --> 00:29:02,298
Everybody has to in life, okay?
Now, you're a man.

339
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:05,672
You're almost six years old.
It's time. Now, let's do it.

340
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:07,471
I don't have to! You can't make me!

341
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:08,978
No, I can make you.

342
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,207
Baby! You're kidding.

343
00:29:12,217 --> 00:29:13,275
- Am I kidding?
- Aren't you?

344
00:29:13,384 --> 00:29:16,012
Oh, yeah. Yeah, we were kidding, right?
Why don't you go to Mommy?

345
00:29:16,154 --> 00:29:18,145
- Yeah.
- I'll go swim with your sister.

346
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:20,451
Come on, baby. Come with Mommy.

347
00:29:20,558 --> 00:29:25,723
'Cause your daddy
is a very abusive man.

348
00:29:34,172 --> 00:29:35,298
Hey.

349
00:29:36,374 --> 00:29:40,504
I put walnut stain on this thing.
Totally fucked it up.

350
00:29:42,514 --> 00:29:44,539
No, you didn't, I think it looks good.

351
00:29:44,682 --> 00:29:47,082
You think I'm ever gonna get
an honest answer out of you,

352
00:29:47,218 --> 00:29:50,585
or are you just gonna
love every single thing I do?

353
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:58,017
It's... You know, I think it's ugly.

354
00:29:59,898 --> 00:30:01,331
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

355
00:30:01,432 --> 00:30:04,333
I steam it. I sand it. I stain it.

356
00:30:04,435 --> 00:30:07,336
And after all of that,
I only got one chance at the finish.

357
00:30:07,438 --> 00:30:11,101
And if I screw that up,
then the whole thing is messed up.

358
00:30:11,242 --> 00:30:15,736
Well, what do I know?
'Cause I'm just here to deliver the water.

359
00:30:51,649 --> 00:30:52,775
Dad!

360
00:30:55,787 --> 00:30:57,220
I promised them Cold Stone.

361
00:30:57,322 --> 00:30:58,914
Dad!

362
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:01,082
To be continued.

363
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:02,216
Okay?

364
00:31:02,327 --> 00:31:03,919
To be continued.

365
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:08,564
- Don't move, all right?
- I won't.

366
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:13,898
Hey, hey!

367
00:31:14,005 --> 00:31:15,495
Daddy, I want strawberry and vanilla.

368
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,073
Okay. Strawberry and vanilla?

369
00:31:17,175 --> 00:31:18,972
Yeah! And Dory wants chocolate,
strawberry and vanilla.

370
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:20,907
What do you mean
strawberry and vanilla?

371
00:31:21,012 --> 00:31:22,343
And Mom wants lemon.

372
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,141
- Lemon? All right.
- Yeah.

373
00:31:34,158 --> 00:31:35,352
I'll be back in a little while.

374
00:31:35,493 --> 00:31:36,926
- Bye!
- Bye.

375
00:31:44,636 --> 00:31:45,762
Dory.

376
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:52,299
You look like a little puppy
waiting for its owner.

377
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:56,039
Where's my ice cream?

378
00:31:58,082 --> 00:31:59,879
- Excuse me.
- Mom.

379
00:32:19,203 --> 00:32:22,195
That's funny. He's not answering.

380
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:08,376
Are you Mrs. Brian Burke?

381
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:18,224
- You love me. You love me.
- No.

382
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:20,923
- Damn it! You bitch!
- No!

383
00:33:21,065 --> 00:33:23,533
You don't love him, you love me!
Do you hear me?

384
00:33:23,634 --> 00:33:25,192
Fuck! And you lied to me!

385
00:33:25,303 --> 00:33:27,430
Don't you ever say that to me again,
do you hear me?

386
00:33:27,572 --> 00:33:29,870
- Don't you ever say that to me!
- Hey! Stop! Stop that!

387
00:33:29,974 --> 00:33:31,601
- That's my wife! That's my wife!
- Stop! I don't care.

388
00:33:31,743 --> 00:33:33,210
You're hurting her! Just leave her alone!

389
00:33:33,311 --> 00:33:34,471
- You told me you were over him!
- Stop!

390
00:33:34,612 --> 00:33:36,477
Stop! Back off!

391
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:46,122
<i>- God.
- Just breathe and count to 10.</i>

392
00:33:46,257 --> 00:33:47,246
<i>I'm breathing, man, all right?</i>

393
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:49,292
<i>Count to 10 for me.</i>

394
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:57,725
- One, two, three, four...
- Yeah, all right, man.

395
00:33:59,837 --> 00:34:00,997
Yes, hi.

396
00:34:01,139 --> 00:34:05,303
I need an ambulance
to Southwest Vista and Elm.

397
00:34:05,443 --> 00:34:10,176
I got a woman here. She's beaten.
She's badly beaten. It's domestic and...

398
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:16,780
No!

399
00:34:26,798 --> 00:34:28,425
I've got two kids.

400
00:34:30,968 --> 00:34:36,497
I've got a 10-year-old girl
and a six-year-old little boy.

401
00:34:39,043 --> 00:34:42,501
And they're in there waiting

402
00:34:42,647 --> 00:34:45,673
for their daddy to come home
with ice cream.

403
00:34:47,652 --> 00:34:49,210
I'm so sorry.

404
00:35:04,902 --> 00:35:06,529
What's going on?

405
00:37:27,678 --> 00:37:28,975
Jerry?

406
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:31,972
Oh, I'm sorry.

407
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:34,176
He doesn't live here anymore.

408
00:37:34,318 --> 00:37:36,946
Okay, can you tell me
where I can find him?

409
00:37:37,054 --> 00:37:38,783
Try the McKinley Clinic.

410
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:43,026
Okay, the McKinley Clinic. Okay.

411
00:38:06,417 --> 00:38:07,714
- Hey!
- Hi.

412
00:38:10,721 --> 00:38:12,712
What are you doing here?

413
00:38:15,259 --> 00:38:18,490
I don't know.
I just wanted to see how you were.

414
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:21,993
Good to see you.

415
00:38:23,901 --> 00:38:25,698
Want some coffee? Water?

416
00:38:27,071 --> 00:38:28,663
- Yeah.
- Come on.

417
00:38:35,046 --> 00:38:38,709
So this is a methadone clinic?

418
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:40,044
Yeah.

419
00:38:42,219 --> 00:38:45,211
- You take methadone?
- Not me.

420
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:51,386
I just help around the clinic
and they give me a place to stay.

421
00:39:02,606 --> 00:39:04,972
When was the last time you used?

422
00:39:06,143 --> 00:39:08,304
Sixteen days ago.

423
00:39:08,446 --> 00:39:12,405
I tried to quit after the funeral,
but I relapsed.

424
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:25,761
So how are the kids?

425
00:39:31,135 --> 00:39:33,501
Harper's messing up in school.

426
00:39:35,606 --> 00:39:36,800
And Dory is

427
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:42,501
having nightmares
where his daddy is the monster.

428
00:39:52,123 --> 00:39:54,523
- Would you like some more?
- No.

429
00:39:57,795 --> 00:39:59,592
I'm gonna shove off.

430
00:40:04,535 --> 00:40:07,470
- Stop it, Harper!
- I'm not doing anything.

431
00:40:14,645 --> 00:40:16,704
Stop it, Harper!

432
00:40:16,881 --> 00:40:20,442
- Mom!
- Harper! Stop it!

433
00:40:20,551 --> 00:40:23,042
You two are acting like little brats!

434
00:40:23,187 --> 00:40:28,284
All I asked you to do this morning
was to sit here and eat quietly.

435
00:40:28,392 --> 00:40:31,225
But you can't even seem to do that,
can you? Don't laugh, Dory!

436
00:40:31,362 --> 00:40:32,488
- Okay!
- It's not funny!

437
00:40:57,188 --> 00:41:00,646
Mom? Can I sleep with you?

438
00:41:00,758 --> 00:41:03,056
Yeah, honey. Come on.

439
00:41:04,762 --> 00:41:07,196
Right here. There we go.

440
00:41:34,592 --> 00:41:36,025
Oh, shit.

441
00:42:23,641 --> 00:42:26,735
- Hey! Okay, look, here's the deal.
- Hi.

442
00:42:26,844 --> 00:42:29,074
We had a fire in our garage.

443
00:42:29,179 --> 00:42:32,740
The good news, we started to rebuild it.

444
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:35,751
The bad news, never finished it.

445
00:42:35,853 --> 00:42:39,914
So, right now, all it is,
is a room with a bathroom.

446
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:44,323
You can't stay here, Jerry.

447
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:49,259
You're nuts.

448
00:42:49,366 --> 00:42:50,492
Why?

449
00:42:52,536 --> 00:42:54,265
Because it's free.

450
00:42:57,074 --> 00:42:58,803
I don't need your charity, Audrey.

451
00:42:58,909 --> 00:43:03,039
Who's offering you charity?
I'm the one that needs the help here.

452
00:43:04,381 --> 00:43:07,714
Really, you know
how high my mortgage is?

453
00:43:07,851 --> 00:43:09,978
You can move in, get yourself situated,

454
00:43:10,087 --> 00:43:13,818
and, eventually, you can get a job
and you can pay me rent.

455
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:29,834
So how come
Brian never mentioned you?

456
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:34,642
'Cause I'm a recovering heroin addict,
maybe?

457
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:48,251
I hate my wife.

458
00:43:50,461 --> 00:43:52,725
I mean, since we're sharing.

459
00:43:54,198 --> 00:43:56,359
I hate everything about her.

460
00:43:57,301 --> 00:44:01,237
And she is gonna be furious when
she finds out I gave this shit to you.

461
00:44:01,372 --> 00:44:02,498
Okay.

462
00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:21,518
- Hey, Dory.
- Hi.

463
00:44:21,625 --> 00:44:24,423
You gonna give us a hand? Okay, cool.

464
00:44:30,834 --> 00:44:32,199
Hey, Dory.

465
00:44:37,274 --> 00:44:38,639
You got it?

466
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:44,576
- There we go.
- Good job, good job. Good job.

467
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:55,625
Yeah? Come in.

468
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:01,225
It's dinnertime.

469
00:45:03,434 --> 00:45:04,924
- Dinnertime?
- Yeah.

470
00:45:05,035 --> 00:45:07,003
My mom wanted me to come over
and get you.

471
00:45:07,137 --> 00:45:08,126
Okay.

472
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:13,408
I need to put on my soles.

473
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:18,743
I got two soles, one and two.

474
00:45:20,184 --> 00:45:21,981
Okay, let's do it.

475
00:45:28,992 --> 00:45:30,584
- Come on, that would be so cool!
- Yeah.

476
00:45:30,694 --> 00:45:32,992
- Yeah, that is so funny.
- Yeah.

477
00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:34,290
- Hey, Jerry.
- How you doing?

478
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:37,026
Come on in. Have a seat.

479
00:45:37,167 --> 00:45:40,466
Girls? Girls, this is Jerry.

480
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:42,664
- Jerry, this is Emily.
- Hi, Emily.

481
00:45:42,806 --> 00:45:44,831
- And this is Sarah.
- Hi, Sarah.

482
00:45:44,975 --> 00:45:48,809
And Jerry is a really good friend
of our family

483
00:45:48,912 --> 00:45:51,005
who's gonna have dinner
with us tonight, okay?

484
00:45:51,148 --> 00:45:52,137
So, who wants chicken?

485
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:53,477
- Oh, me!
- Yeah?

486
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:56,485
- Chicken. Jerry?
- No, I'm a vegetarian.

487
00:45:56,587 --> 00:45:58,282
You are? So am I.

488
00:45:58,388 --> 00:45:59,685
- Meat is murder.
- I want chicken.

489
00:45:59,823 --> 00:46:02,815
I'm gonna give it to you right now,
darling. There you go, one for you.

490
00:46:02,926 --> 00:46:05,019
So, I've been to California. Have you?

491
00:46:05,162 --> 00:46:08,654
Really? I haven't been to California,
but I hear it's really, really cool.

492
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:11,132
- Yeah.
- I've always wanted to go there.

493
00:46:11,235 --> 00:46:12,497
It's really hot in the summer.

494
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:17,734
Like, I was there in short-sleeve shirts
and shorts all the time. It was so hot.

495
00:46:17,875 --> 00:46:19,740
<i>- That is so cool.
- And it was so... Yeah.</i>

496
00:47:18,435 --> 00:47:19,595
Hey.

497
00:47:21,605 --> 00:47:22,970
Hey, Jerry!

498
00:47:24,942 --> 00:47:26,068
Yeah?

499
00:47:26,476 --> 00:47:28,137
I used to run with Brian every...

500
00:47:28,278 --> 00:47:31,145
I used to run with Brian every morning.

501
00:47:33,483 --> 00:47:36,281
So you want to go for a run?

502
00:47:40,023 --> 00:47:43,083
I mean, I'm smoking, Howard.

503
00:47:45,996 --> 00:47:47,395
I'll wait.

504
00:47:47,497 --> 00:47:51,092
Howard, I haven't ran
since junior high school.

505
00:47:51,201 --> 00:47:52,896
We'll just, you know,
go for however long.

506
00:47:53,003 --> 00:47:55,267
You know,
down to the driveway, whatever.

507
00:47:55,372 --> 00:47:57,567
We'll just go, you know?

508
00:47:57,708 --> 00:48:01,007
- I don't know if I can do it.
- We'll just go slow.

509
00:48:05,182 --> 00:48:09,016
That's it. That's it. Can't do it.

510
00:48:09,186 --> 00:48:10,346
Okay.

511
00:48:25,402 --> 00:48:27,165
This was our route.

512
00:48:30,407 --> 00:48:33,035
Thought about changing it afterward,

513
00:48:35,979 --> 00:48:38,106
but this is our route.

514
00:48:44,688 --> 00:48:48,146
Audrey, I don't think
she's facing reality, man.

515
00:48:50,861 --> 00:48:53,352
Is she gonna have to get a job?

516
00:48:53,497 --> 00:48:55,055
Who told you that?

517
00:48:55,198 --> 00:48:59,157
No. Brian was a great developer.

518
00:48:59,269 --> 00:49:02,033
He really thought outside the box,
you know? Great at rehabbing space.

519
00:49:02,172 --> 00:49:05,505
Found opportunities
where nobody else could. Was just...

520
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:08,009
Their house? Paid off long ago.

521
00:49:08,578 --> 00:49:12,412
No, Audrey'll never have to worry
about money.

522
00:49:19,056 --> 00:49:21,183
- Morning.
- Hey.

523
00:49:21,291 --> 00:49:23,885
- Can I have some water?
- Yeah.

524
00:49:25,028 --> 00:49:26,518
Thank you.

525
00:49:40,043 --> 00:49:41,203
So...

526
00:49:52,122 --> 00:49:53,612
Why am I here?

527
00:50:07,604 --> 00:50:09,401
I don't really know.

528
00:50:20,484 --> 00:50:23,214
You know, it should've been you, Jerry.

529
00:50:29,159 --> 00:50:30,888
Why wasn't it you?

530
00:50:59,489 --> 00:51:02,515
- Sonics suck.
- You suck.

531
00:51:02,659 --> 00:51:04,650
It's a rebuilding year.

532
00:51:06,063 --> 00:51:07,530
What?

533
00:51:07,664 --> 00:51:09,188
"Rebuilding year?"

534
00:51:09,332 --> 00:51:11,027
- You're nine.
- Ten.

535
00:51:11,168 --> 00:51:12,601
And I'd take you down
on the court anytime.

536
00:51:12,702 --> 00:51:14,761
Oh, yeah? Go ahead.

537
00:51:18,542 --> 00:51:22,137
One more time, one more time,
one more time. Shoot it. Shoot it.

538
00:51:24,648 --> 00:51:25,979
Check.

539
00:51:27,484 --> 00:51:29,042
Come on, check.

540
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:33,114
Do you ever feel
like you're inside of a movie?

541
00:51:33,523 --> 00:51:36,185
Do I ever feel like I'm inside a movie?

542
00:51:36,593 --> 00:51:37,685
No.

543
00:51:39,863 --> 00:51:41,524
It's a sad movie.

544
00:51:47,504 --> 00:51:49,904
You know, it'll change, Harp.

545
00:51:53,577 --> 00:51:54,908
I promise.

546
00:51:58,281 --> 00:52:00,579
Promise. Give me a high-five.

547
00:52:02,953 --> 00:52:04,079
Okay.

548
00:52:05,021 --> 00:52:06,682
The hook, the hook!
You gotta do the hook.

549
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:09,054
Do the hook. Do the hook.

550
00:52:52,669 --> 00:52:54,637
And I'm...

551
00:52:56,239 --> 00:53:00,699
I'm wondering if maybe you might
be able to help me do something.

552
00:53:01,912 --> 00:53:03,038
Sure.

553
00:53:05,348 --> 00:53:06,645
Sleep.

554
00:53:08,485 --> 00:53:10,419
- I need to sleep.
- Sure.

555
00:53:23,967 --> 00:53:26,333
Okay, leave your shoes out here.

556
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:33,441
And shut the door.

557
00:53:39,482 --> 00:53:40,608
Okay.

558
00:53:41,284 --> 00:53:42,512
Come on.

559
00:53:44,054 --> 00:53:46,420
- Okay.
- I need to sleep.

560
00:53:49,492 --> 00:53:52,825
- I don't know about this.
- No, trust me.

561
00:53:52,963 --> 00:53:55,625
This used to work better than Ambien.

562
00:53:57,367 --> 00:53:58,527
Okay.

563
00:53:59,669 --> 00:54:05,130
Bring this knee up, like that. Higher.
Yeah, that's it.

564
00:54:08,545 --> 00:54:10,308
Turn off the light.

565
00:54:14,884 --> 00:54:18,445
Okay, now... Now take your hand

566
00:54:21,424 --> 00:54:24,291
and pull down on the earlobe.

567
00:54:25,428 --> 00:54:29,057
Just pull down. Yeah, just like that.

568
00:54:30,267 --> 00:54:34,067
Yeah, but do it faster. Harder.

569
00:54:36,506 --> 00:54:37,530
Yeah.

570
00:54:37,674 --> 00:54:39,642
- Like that?
- That's it.

571
00:54:41,044 --> 00:54:42,875
Just keep doing that.

572
00:54:54,057 --> 00:54:56,719
I'm still awake. You gotta keep going.

573
00:54:59,562 --> 00:55:02,326
- Keep going, keep going.
- Okay, okay, okay.

574
00:55:02,432 --> 00:55:03,831
Keep going.

575
00:56:00,623 --> 00:56:03,956
Just for today,
my thoughts will be on my recovery.

576
00:56:04,094 --> 00:56:07,495
Living and enjoying life
without the use of drugs.

577
00:56:07,630 --> 00:56:10,929
Just for today,
I will have faith in someone in N.A.

578
00:56:11,034 --> 00:56:14,629
Who believes in me
and wants to help me in my recovery.

579
00:56:14,771 --> 00:56:16,466
Just for today, through N.A.,

580
00:56:16,606 --> 00:56:19,837
I will try to get
a better perspective on my life.

581
00:56:19,976 --> 00:56:22,171
Just for today, I will be unafraid.

582
00:56:22,312 --> 00:56:25,145
My thoughts will be
on my new associations,

583
00:56:25,281 --> 00:56:27,010
people who are not using

584
00:56:27,150 --> 00:56:29,277
and who have found a new way of life.

585
00:56:29,386 --> 00:56:33,015
So long as I follow that way,
I have nothing to fear.

586
00:56:34,724 --> 00:56:37,488
Is there anyone else
that'd like to share?

587
00:56:38,661 --> 00:56:40,128
- Okay.
- Yeah?

588
00:56:41,664 --> 00:56:43,859
Hi, my name is Jerry and I'm an addict.

589
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,365
- Hi, Jerry.
- Hi, Jerry.

590
00:56:45,502 --> 00:56:47,697
I've been clean for 21 days.

591
00:56:48,872 --> 00:56:51,966
I'm here because my friend died.

592
00:56:52,075 --> 00:56:53,770
He wasn't a user.

593
00:56:54,878 --> 00:56:56,607
I knew him since second grade,

594
00:56:56,713 --> 00:57:00,513
and he was the only person
who never, ever gave up on me.

595
00:57:00,650 --> 00:57:04,177
He died a hero in this fucked-up,
tragic way.

596
00:57:07,424 --> 00:57:08,948
It killed me.

597
00:57:10,326 --> 00:57:11,884
It really did.

598
00:57:21,571 --> 00:57:23,471
- Jerry?
- Yeah?

599
00:57:23,573 --> 00:57:25,040
- Hey.
- Kelly.

600
00:57:27,010 --> 00:57:28,671
I liked your share tonight.

601
00:57:28,778 --> 00:57:31,906
Good. I like compliments. Thank you.

602
00:57:32,048 --> 00:57:34,915
- So 21 days, huh?
- Yeah.

603
00:57:35,051 --> 00:57:38,145
- Bouncing off the bottom.
- That's right, yeah.

604
00:57:41,391 --> 00:57:44,554
You should stay till the Serenity Prayer.

605
00:57:44,694 --> 00:57:45,991
- Excuse me?
- Well, last week you left

606
00:57:46,095 --> 00:57:49,826
before the Serenity Prayer,
and it's disrespectful to leave before it.

607
00:57:49,933 --> 00:57:51,764
Disrespectful to who?

608
00:57:53,369 --> 00:57:55,030
To your recovery.

609
00:57:56,806 --> 00:57:59,331
Well, my recovery thanks you.

610
00:58:06,049 --> 00:58:08,711
- Are you married?
- No.

611
00:58:11,421 --> 00:58:13,548
Do you have children?

612
00:58:13,656 --> 00:58:15,681
Do I have children? Two.

613
00:58:16,092 --> 00:58:19,220
A six-year-old son
and a 10-year-old daughter.

614
00:58:21,564 --> 00:58:25,728
Well, I should probably go,

615
00:58:25,835 --> 00:58:28,963
but I'll see you next week.

616
00:58:29,105 --> 00:58:30,231
Yeah.

617
00:58:31,741 --> 00:58:33,072
Buckle up!

618
00:58:41,317 --> 00:58:43,717
- Hey. Hi.
- Hi. Hey.

619
00:58:45,121 --> 00:58:48,147
You hungry? You want me
to make you a sandwich or...

620
00:58:48,291 --> 00:58:52,091
No, no, I'm fine.
You think I could use the computer?

621
00:58:53,463 --> 00:58:55,226
Yeah. Sure.

622
00:58:55,331 --> 00:58:58,129
Howard wants me
to look into something.

623
00:58:58,268 --> 00:59:00,634
Okay. Come on, I'll show you.

624
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:05,930
It's in there.

625
01:00:00,661 --> 01:00:04,961
I know I should...
I think I need to clean it out or...

626
01:00:50,277 --> 01:00:52,541
Those shoes are looking good!

627
01:01:01,154 --> 01:01:04,214
So, how does a lawyer
become a heroin addict?

628
01:01:07,494 --> 01:01:09,553
- Really?
- Yeah.

629
01:01:09,663 --> 01:01:13,895
Well, you start by doing coke, and then
you move on to a little crystal meth,

630
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:17,959
you get paranoid, then you find heroin,
and after that...

631
01:01:20,774 --> 01:01:23,140
But you were a good lawyer, right?

632
01:01:26,513 --> 01:01:28,481
Who cares? Look at me.

633
01:01:31,685 --> 01:01:33,380
Come work for me.

634
01:01:35,355 --> 01:01:37,755
I don't know the first thing
about the mortgage business, Howard.

635
01:01:37,858 --> 01:01:40,326
You know what a house is, right?

636
01:01:40,460 --> 01:01:43,429
That's a good interview. You got the job.

637
01:01:49,603 --> 01:01:51,002
Here you go.

638
01:01:52,038 --> 01:01:53,403
Thank you.

639
01:01:54,941 --> 01:01:58,308
- And here's the living room.
- Yeah.

640
01:01:58,445 --> 01:02:02,575
As you can see, Doris gets her
decorating tips from Uday Hussein.

641
01:02:03,617 --> 01:02:06,586
She's gonna get all this, you know,
the house and everything.

642
01:02:06,686 --> 01:02:09,154
- So you're gonna go for it?
- Yeah.

643
01:02:10,657 --> 01:02:13,922
But I'm not good at facing my fears.

644
01:02:15,829 --> 01:02:17,922
I'm not strong like you.

645
01:02:19,633 --> 01:02:21,157
Strong like me?

646
01:02:24,704 --> 01:02:27,605
Look, you're gonna have
to take this test,

647
01:02:27,707 --> 01:02:29,538
the Washington State
mortgage brokers' exam,

648
01:02:29,676 --> 01:02:32,839
but don't freak out.
I'll coach you through it.

649
01:02:38,018 --> 01:02:39,713
- You sure?
- Yeah.

650
01:02:41,655 --> 01:02:42,781
Good.

651
01:04:12,279 --> 01:04:14,941
Hey. I brought your laundry.

652
01:04:16,816 --> 01:04:18,545
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

653
01:04:20,987 --> 01:04:22,784
You look good.

654
01:04:22,923 --> 01:04:26,723
I mean, a lot better than you did
when you got here.

655
01:04:27,527 --> 01:04:30,985
Thank you. Thirty-nine days.

656
01:04:39,139 --> 01:04:41,073
What's heroin like?

657
01:04:45,779 --> 01:04:49,340
You ever heard that expression,
"Being kissed by God"?

658
01:04:53,787 --> 01:04:55,948
Well, that's just at first.

659
01:05:25,986 --> 01:05:28,352
All you do is you chase it.

660
01:05:29,489 --> 01:05:33,016
You chase that initial feeling
when you can never get it back.

661
01:05:33,159 --> 01:05:36,458
You can get the escape
when you do get high,

662
01:05:36,563 --> 01:05:39,191
but never like the first few times.

663
01:05:40,734 --> 01:05:42,531
I wanna escape.

664
01:05:44,904 --> 01:05:46,064
Yeah.

665
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:51,301
I wanna know
what it feels like to escape.

666
01:05:51,411 --> 01:05:53,174
No, you wouldn't.

667
01:05:53,913 --> 01:05:55,403
Yes, I would.

668
01:05:57,917 --> 01:06:02,377
And I would chase that feeling all day.

669
01:06:04,557 --> 01:06:07,253
I would chase it
until I couldn't chase it anymore.

670
01:06:07,427 --> 01:06:08,758
- No, you wouldn't.
- Yes, I would chase it.

671
01:06:08,895 --> 01:06:10,260
No, you wouldn't.

672
01:06:11,865 --> 01:06:13,696
You're too strong.

673
01:06:15,301 --> 01:06:16,700
Too engaged.

674
01:06:44,130 --> 01:06:45,461
I'm sorry.

675
01:06:51,905 --> 01:06:53,600
Sorry about that.

676
01:06:56,342 --> 01:06:57,468
Yeah.

677
01:07:02,515 --> 01:07:03,914
I'm sorry.

678
01:07:15,428 --> 01:07:16,554
Oh, you...

679
01:07:21,134 --> 01:07:22,396
Let's play, sucker!

680
01:07:22,502 --> 01:07:24,732
Don't let my head get wet.

681
01:07:24,838 --> 01:07:28,274
- You don't let your head under water?
- No.

682
01:07:28,374 --> 01:07:30,842
Can you put your chin under water?

683
01:07:31,711 --> 01:07:33,008
Show me.

684
01:07:37,684 --> 01:07:39,515
How about this ear?

685
01:07:42,789 --> 01:07:44,848
- And the other ear?
- Yeah.

686
01:07:45,959 --> 01:07:48,018
And the top of your head?

687
01:07:51,498 --> 01:07:53,864
There, you just put your head
under water.

688
01:07:55,368 --> 01:07:59,361
Your chin, the top of your head,
both of your ears.

689
01:08:00,140 --> 01:08:02,870
That's everything, man.
How do you feel?

690
01:08:04,511 --> 01:08:05,773
I don't know.

691
01:08:05,879 --> 01:08:08,973
Well, why don't you put it under
and tell me?

692
01:08:09,082 --> 01:08:11,175
You've already done it.

693
01:08:11,317 --> 01:08:13,877
It's easy to do something
you've already done, man.

694
01:08:14,020 --> 01:08:16,648
- Wanna do it fast?
- Yeah.

695
01:08:16,756 --> 01:08:18,383
On three?

696
01:08:18,525 --> 01:08:22,894
One, two, three!

697
01:08:41,080 --> 01:08:42,911
- Hi.
- Hi.

698
01:08:43,049 --> 01:08:44,539
Everything okay?

699
01:08:44,684 --> 01:08:47,016
- Yeah. Can I...
- Yeah, come in. Yeah.

700
01:08:53,359 --> 01:08:54,690
Sit down.

701
01:09:00,366 --> 01:09:01,924
Sit down. Yeah.

702
01:09:05,705 --> 01:09:08,674
What you did today broke my heart.

703
01:09:11,377 --> 01:09:12,935
What'd I do?

704
01:09:13,079 --> 01:09:16,105
You got Dory
to put his head under the water.

705
01:09:18,418 --> 01:09:21,512
- Just a cute trick, you know.
- He's six.

706
01:09:21,621 --> 01:09:24,419
Harper put hers under
when she was only three.

707
01:09:24,557 --> 01:09:27,549
It was something
that Brian tried and tried

708
01:09:27,660 --> 01:09:30,060
to get Dory to do, but he couldn't.

709
01:09:30,163 --> 01:09:34,532
And that victory today
of getting Dory's head to go under

710
01:09:34,634 --> 01:09:37,102
was not supposed to be yours.

711
01:09:38,938 --> 01:09:41,805
It wasn't meant for you
to have that moment.

712
01:09:41,941 --> 01:09:46,139
And for me, watching you was like this...

713
01:09:48,581 --> 01:09:49,570
This...

714
01:09:51,284 --> 01:09:52,649
I'm sorry.

715
01:10:22,282 --> 01:10:24,307
Harper's missing.

716
01:10:24,450 --> 01:10:25,815
The principal just called.

717
01:10:25,952 --> 01:10:29,410
She's not in school now
and she wasn't there yesterday, either.

718
01:10:29,522 --> 01:10:33,583
She's been missing school for two days,
but she was here last night.

719
01:10:33,693 --> 01:10:36,628
I'm freaking out, Jerry.
She's not answering her cell phone.

720
01:10:36,729 --> 01:10:39,163
I saw her get on the school bus
this morning, okay?

721
01:10:39,299 --> 01:10:43,793
Well, you stay here in case she comes
back because I'm going to the school.

722
01:10:43,903 --> 01:10:45,768
<i>... life without you.</i>

723
01:10:48,141 --> 01:10:49,870
<i>And you know I'm not afraid to die.</i>

724
01:10:50,476 --> 01:10:52,205
<i>That's between you
and yourself, Norma.</i>

725
01:10:52,345 --> 01:10:54,939
<i>You think I made that up
about the gun, don't you?</i>

726
01:10:56,249 --> 01:10:57,546
Harper!

727
01:11:01,888 --> 01:11:05,153
Call your mommy right now
and tell her you're fine.

728
01:11:07,994 --> 01:11:10,292
Yeah, it's almost over.

729
01:11:11,164 --> 01:11:14,793
Call her right now!
Right now, young girl!

730
01:11:22,208 --> 01:11:24,642
How'd you know where to find me?

731
01:11:27,513 --> 01:11:29,174
Your dad told me.

732
01:11:45,865 --> 01:11:47,196
You know,

733
01:11:48,134 --> 01:11:51,865
you could marry my mom
and then she'd be happy again,

734
01:11:51,971 --> 01:11:54,201
and we could be a family.

735
01:11:55,808 --> 01:11:57,673
That could never happen, Harp.

736
01:11:57,777 --> 01:11:59,244
Why not?

737
01:11:59,379 --> 01:12:03,941
Because that would make it so
my best friend never existed.

738
01:12:04,083 --> 01:12:05,243
But...

739
01:12:06,652 --> 01:12:08,119
He did exist.

740
01:12:11,824 --> 01:12:13,257
I guess that's why.

741
01:12:13,393 --> 01:12:17,796
And it doesn't matter because I could
never fill his shoes, you know?

742
01:12:22,235 --> 01:12:24,465
You know what?
I passed the test, though.

743
01:12:24,604 --> 01:12:26,094
- Really?
- Yep.

744
01:12:26,239 --> 01:12:28,298
- Good job.
- Thank you.

745
01:12:32,979 --> 01:12:34,879
Well, go ahead and tell her.

746
01:12:34,981 --> 01:12:36,448
You tell her.

747
01:12:36,616 --> 01:12:40,052
Well, there is a week every year

748
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:44,817
that the Park Theater plays a different
black-and-white movie every day,

749
01:12:44,957 --> 01:12:48,893
and Brian used to take off work
and pull Harper out of school,

750
01:12:48,995 --> 01:12:50,292
and they'd both play hooky together

751
01:12:50,430 --> 01:12:52,830
and see one of these
black-and-white movies,

752
01:12:52,965 --> 01:12:56,332
so that's where
I found baby Hitchcock over here.

753
01:13:07,547 --> 01:13:09,947
How'd you know about the movies?

754
01:13:11,050 --> 01:13:12,642
Brian told me.

755
01:13:14,287 --> 01:13:17,814
So how the fuck did you know about it
and I didn't?

756
01:13:19,725 --> 01:13:21,158
I don't know.

757
01:13:23,463 --> 01:13:27,456
Maybe he knew if you did,
you wouldn't let him do it again.

758
01:13:29,802 --> 01:13:32,430
Just don't take it out on her, okay?

759
01:13:33,873 --> 01:13:35,670
It's not her fault.

760
01:13:45,051 --> 01:13:46,484
What's wrong?

761
01:13:47,353 --> 01:13:49,446
This isn't working, Jerry.

762
01:13:50,723 --> 01:13:53,191
Those are my kids,

763
01:13:53,326 --> 01:13:56,227
and I don't need you or anybody else
telling me how to raise them.

764
01:13:56,362 --> 01:13:58,023
I know that.

765
01:13:58,164 --> 01:14:01,224
You need to get your stuff
and you need to go.

766
01:14:03,102 --> 01:14:04,228
Go.

767
01:14:07,707 --> 01:14:09,072
Audrey.

768
01:14:11,711 --> 01:14:12,973
Audrey.

769
01:14:14,380 --> 01:14:15,574
Audrey.

770
01:14:17,383 --> 01:14:18,407
Audrey.

771
01:14:18,551 --> 01:14:20,678
Audrey, Audrey, stop.

772
01:14:24,624 --> 01:14:26,182
This is unfair.

773
01:14:26,292 --> 01:14:29,090
Not to me, to Harper and Dory.

774
01:14:31,731 --> 01:14:34,598
Yeah, you're being selfish.

775
01:14:36,035 --> 01:14:37,332
Fuck you!

776
01:14:44,143 --> 01:14:45,610
- Thank you, Michael.
- Thank you, Michael.

777
01:14:45,745 --> 01:14:47,679
Anyone else? Okay, who's next?

778
01:14:48,881 --> 01:14:49,939
Kelly.

779
01:14:50,082 --> 01:14:52,209
Hi, my name's Kelly and I'm an addict.

780
01:14:52,318 --> 01:14:54,047
- Hi, Kelly.
- Hi, Kelly.

781
01:14:54,153 --> 01:14:57,088
So I'm really mad today and frustrated

782
01:14:57,223 --> 01:15:00,249
because there's this woman
at the convalescent home I work at,

783
01:15:00,393 --> 01:15:03,692
her name's Catherine.
She's 96 years old.

784
01:15:03,796 --> 01:15:07,732
She's always been this really upbeat,
high-energy, optimistic...

785
01:15:07,833 --> 01:15:12,031
Big smile all the time, and she was
recently diagnosed with cancer.

786
01:15:12,138 --> 01:15:15,403
But it's the kind that spreads slowly,
you know, it takes about 20 years.

787
01:15:15,508 --> 01:15:18,136
And I didn't want them to tell her.
You know, what's the point, right?

788
01:15:18,277 --> 01:15:22,805
She's gonna die of old age.
She's not gonna die of cancer.

789
01:15:22,949 --> 01:15:24,075
They fucking told her!

790
01:15:24,183 --> 01:15:27,152
And now she knows,
she's in her bed all day,

791
01:15:27,286 --> 01:15:29,720
she sleeps, she cries. It's...

792
01:15:30,590 --> 01:15:33,726
I just...
I don't think that they should've told her.

793
01:15:34,827 --> 01:15:36,658
I'll be back.

794
01:15:36,796 --> 01:15:38,730
- Thanks, Kelly.
- Thanks, Kelly.

795
01:15:38,831 --> 01:15:42,494
Now, for those who wish,
please let's join in the Serenity Prayer.

796
01:15:53,446 --> 01:15:59,407
God, grant me the serenity
to accept the things I cannot change,

797
01:15:59,518 --> 01:16:03,010
the courage to change the things I can,

798
01:16:03,155 --> 01:16:05,453
and the wisdom to know the difference.

799
01:16:35,688 --> 01:16:38,555
Are you gonna sell those to buy drugs?

800
01:16:38,691 --> 01:16:40,215
Excuse me?

801
01:16:40,359 --> 01:16:42,884
Are you gonna sell it to buy drugs?

802
01:16:44,330 --> 01:16:46,059
Why aren't you in bed?

803
01:16:46,832 --> 01:16:48,561
I had a nightmare.

804
01:16:50,403 --> 01:16:52,030
Well, me, too.

805
01:16:54,073 --> 01:16:57,338
Don't steal those. Put them back.
It's bad.

806
01:16:59,578 --> 01:17:01,045
Put them back.

807
01:17:03,849 --> 01:17:05,316
Put them back.

808
01:17:05,418 --> 01:17:06,544
Okay.

809
01:17:06,686 --> 01:17:08,745
- It's not good.
- Okay.

810
01:17:09,922 --> 01:17:11,082
Okay.

811
01:17:36,115 --> 01:17:39,448
So what's your nightmare about?

812
01:17:44,090 --> 01:17:45,455
I woke up,

813
01:17:46,625 --> 01:17:48,752
went into my mom's bedroom.

814
01:17:49,161 --> 01:17:51,561
She wasn't there. She was gone.

815
01:17:52,998 --> 01:17:55,865
I came down here
to check where she was.

816
01:17:57,470 --> 01:17:59,028
Then I woke up.

817
01:18:06,412 --> 01:18:10,109
You know, the good thing is that it's...
It's just a dream.

818
01:18:10,683 --> 01:18:12,241
It's not real.

819
01:18:15,154 --> 01:18:18,590
She usually sits with me
until I fall back asleep.

820
01:18:25,831 --> 01:18:30,427
"I look at each game, each day,
as a new chance."

821
01:18:49,188 --> 01:18:52,783
Jerry! Let's play, sucker!

822
01:19:02,902 --> 01:19:06,338
Jerry's gone! He's moved out!

823
01:19:06,739 --> 01:19:09,537
He's gonna go do drugs again.

824
01:19:09,675 --> 01:19:13,042
He's not gonna go do drugs, honey.
Why would you think that?

825
01:19:13,179 --> 01:19:14,339
Is it because of me?

826
01:19:14,480 --> 01:19:17,040
Because I skipped school
to go see those old movies?

827
01:19:17,183 --> 01:19:19,811
I promise, I promise,
I'll never do it again!

828
01:19:19,919 --> 01:19:21,716
Just let Jerry come back!

829
01:19:21,854 --> 01:19:26,382
Honey, nothing you did
made Jerry leave, okay?

830
01:19:27,426 --> 01:19:31,021
He's gonna be back, you'll see.
And he's gonna be fine.

831
01:19:31,163 --> 01:19:32,892
He's a big guy.

832
01:19:33,032 --> 01:19:36,524
Trust me on this one.
Come on, give me the ball.

833
01:19:36,669 --> 01:19:39,331
Does that mean Jerry's gonna die now?

834
01:19:41,006 --> 01:19:44,237
Congratulations on two years
of being clean.

835
01:19:48,047 --> 01:19:49,241
Thank you.

836
01:19:52,284 --> 01:19:54,343
My name is Frances and I'm an addict.

837
01:19:54,453 --> 01:19:55,920
Hi, Frances.

838
01:19:57,089 --> 01:20:00,183
Coming here for two years now

839
01:20:00,292 --> 01:20:03,261
has made me believe
that this is possible.

840
01:20:06,799 --> 01:20:11,065
My mother gave me this bear
when I was five years old,

841
01:20:11,203 --> 01:20:14,570
and I plan to pass this bear
on to my daughter when she's five.

842
01:20:14,707 --> 01:20:16,868
You're gonna make it, girl.

843
01:20:16,976 --> 01:20:18,375
<i>Thank you.</i>

844
01:20:25,818 --> 01:20:27,376
Jerry?

845
01:20:27,486 --> 01:20:28,748
<i>Who is this?</i>

846
01:20:30,623 --> 01:20:32,090
Who's this?

847
01:20:32,224 --> 01:20:33,885
My name's Kelly.

848
01:20:36,428 --> 01:20:38,453
Is this where Jerry lives?

849
01:20:38,597 --> 01:20:40,189
<i>- Yeah.
- Is he there?</i>

850
01:20:40,299 --> 01:20:42,733
'Cause he wasn't at the N.A. Meeting.

851
01:20:42,835 --> 01:20:43,893
<i>It was Fran's birthday,</i>

852
01:20:44,003 --> 01:20:46,267
and this wasn't a meeting
that he would've missed.

853
01:20:46,405 --> 01:20:48,236
<i>What does that mean?</i>

854
01:20:50,075 --> 01:20:51,736
<i>He's relapsed.</i>

855
01:20:56,181 --> 01:20:59,912
<i>Do you have any idea
where he might be?</i>

856
01:21:00,019 --> 01:21:02,146
<i>You don't wanna go there.</i>

857
01:21:39,625 --> 01:21:41,149
Hey, baby!

858
01:22:01,413 --> 01:22:02,539
Jerry?

859
01:22:06,685 --> 01:22:07,811
Jerry?

860
01:22:08,854 --> 01:22:12,449
Jerry! Jerry! It's Audrey.

861
01:22:13,692 --> 01:22:17,128
- Hi, Audrey.
- It's Audrey. Get up.

862
01:22:17,229 --> 01:22:22,690
I'm taking you home.
Come on! Get up! Get up!

863
01:22:27,673 --> 01:22:28,901
Come on.

864
01:22:31,276 --> 01:22:32,538
Come on.

865
01:22:42,755 --> 01:22:44,552
You see what's left?

866
01:22:46,859 --> 01:22:48,383
Shut up, Jerry.

867
01:22:51,430 --> 01:22:52,897
What can I get for you, Jerry,

868
01:22:53,032 --> 01:22:56,365
right now,
that's gonna help you feel better?

869
01:22:56,468 --> 01:22:57,833
Chocolate.

870
01:22:58,437 --> 01:22:59,768
Chocolate.

871
01:23:02,241 --> 01:23:04,903
Come on. Jerry.

872
01:23:05,044 --> 01:23:07,740
It's fucked up. It's fucked up.

873
01:23:07,880 --> 01:23:12,681
- It's fucked up.
- Sit down, Jerry. Sit down. Yeah.

874
01:23:12,785 --> 01:23:14,082
Jerry?

875
01:23:14,219 --> 01:23:15,777
What else do you need?

876
01:23:15,921 --> 01:23:19,789
You know what?
I would like some ice cream, please.

877
01:23:19,925 --> 01:23:22,393
Okay, I'll get you some ice cream,

878
01:23:22,494 --> 01:23:26,055
but for right now, Neal is gonna
stay here with you, okay?

879
01:23:27,399 --> 01:23:28,388
Okay?

880
01:23:34,807 --> 01:23:36,741
- Hi, Neal.
- Hey, Jerry.

881
01:23:38,243 --> 01:23:41,346
Looks like we're gonna be roommates
for a while, all right?

882
01:23:41,346 --> 01:23:42,040
Looks like we're gonna be roommates
for a while, all right?

883
01:23:42,915 --> 01:23:46,407
Fine with me, but don't...

884
01:23:50,923 --> 01:23:52,288
Hey, Jerry?

885
01:23:56,462 --> 01:24:01,832
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Jerry! Jerry! Jerry! Jerry!

886
01:24:01,967 --> 01:24:03,457
Too much sleep.

887
01:24:05,370 --> 01:24:08,134
Well, we're gonna get you cleaned up.

888
01:24:09,341 --> 01:24:10,831
Get you out of those clothes.

889
01:24:10,976 --> 01:24:15,003
I hate it, man. I hate it.

890
01:24:16,882 --> 01:24:19,749
Oopsie-daisy.
Okay, you got any more drugs on you?

891
01:24:19,852 --> 01:24:21,843
I don't. Oh, no.

892
01:24:21,987 --> 01:24:23,477
Any needles?

893
01:24:26,191 --> 01:24:28,284
Okay, get that off.

894
01:24:31,330 --> 01:24:32,854
We're gonna put that...

895
01:24:33,132 --> 01:24:34,759
Hey! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

896
01:24:34,867 --> 01:24:37,165
Hey, you just got here.
Go ahead, sit down.

897
01:25:06,265 --> 01:25:07,823
Who's with him?

898
01:25:08,767 --> 01:25:11,736
My brother.
Thanks for telling me about him.

899
01:25:15,541 --> 01:25:17,805
Are you his girlfriend?

900
01:25:17,910 --> 01:25:19,810
No. No.

901
01:25:21,513 --> 01:25:22,502
He

902
01:25:24,416 --> 01:25:26,884
was my husband's best friend.

903
01:25:29,221 --> 01:25:31,519
The one who was shot?

904
01:25:40,799 --> 01:25:43,097
Was he the love of your life?

905
01:25:49,408 --> 01:25:51,842
I lost the love of my life, too.

906
01:25:54,279 --> 01:25:55,871
To an overdose.

907
01:25:57,382 --> 01:25:59,680
But it's what got me clean.

908
01:25:59,785 --> 01:26:02,686
You know, they say
that every time a user dies,

909
01:26:02,788 --> 01:26:04,722
there's one
that gets clean because of it.

910
01:26:06,225 --> 01:26:08,022
How long ago?

911
01:26:08,126 --> 01:26:10,526
2,653 days.

912
01:26:14,333 --> 01:26:16,631
Does it get better?

913
01:26:16,768 --> 01:26:18,702
It gets different.

914
01:26:18,804 --> 01:26:20,567
I have a new life,

915
01:26:21,607 --> 01:26:25,236
so now I can have a new love of my life.

916
01:26:29,014 --> 01:26:32,450
Well, I don't know anything
about addiction, Kelly,

917
01:26:32,584 --> 01:26:34,814
so would you like to help me?

918
01:26:36,855 --> 01:26:40,222
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Okay!

919
01:26:40,626 --> 01:26:42,992
Hey, hey, hey.

920
01:26:43,128 --> 01:26:45,255
Come on, come on, come on.

921
01:26:48,267 --> 01:26:51,498
Come on. Come on, come on.

922
01:26:51,637 --> 01:26:53,832
Come on. Come on. Come on.

923
01:26:53,972 --> 01:26:55,405
You gotta breathe.
You gotta breathe, baby.

924
01:26:55,507 --> 01:26:58,738
It's me, it's me. It's okay.
You gotta breathe.

925
01:27:28,707 --> 01:27:30,766
I got you.

926
01:27:32,144 --> 01:27:33,543
It's okay.

927
01:27:35,180 --> 01:27:37,614
Okay, okay. Nice and easy.

928
01:27:37,716 --> 01:27:39,479
I feel like shit.

929
01:27:41,353 --> 01:27:43,844
So the antacid you can give him now.

930
01:27:43,989 --> 01:27:47,652
The tea is to help him
keep down solids,

931
01:27:47,759 --> 01:27:51,126
and you want to give him
the antihistamine really only at night.

932
01:27:51,229 --> 01:27:54,323
- Okay. No, no, no, that's for Jerry.
- Nice.

933
01:27:54,433 --> 01:27:56,833
Do you want a little taste? Huh?

934
01:27:57,703 --> 01:27:59,466
When can I see him?

935
01:28:03,075 --> 01:28:06,306
Very soon, honey. Promise.

936
01:28:13,618 --> 01:28:15,142
All right. Come on, right here, man.

937
01:28:15,253 --> 01:28:17,915
Take this. Take this.
It's gonna help you out.

938
01:28:19,558 --> 01:28:22,652
All right, get it down, get it down.

939
01:28:22,761 --> 01:28:24,991
A little water. All right.

940
01:28:34,139 --> 01:28:35,504
I'm cold!

941
01:29:28,693 --> 01:29:31,059
Are you gonna die like my dad?

942
01:29:31,863 --> 01:29:33,057
Yeah.

943
01:29:35,267 --> 01:29:36,791
When?

944
01:29:36,935 --> 01:29:39,597
As soon as possible, I hope.

945
01:29:40,839 --> 01:29:42,830
You're kidding, right?

946
01:29:51,850 --> 01:29:54,512
I brought you some cookies and water.

947
01:29:55,454 --> 01:29:58,423
C-3PO and R2-D2.

948
01:29:58,523 --> 01:29:59,649
Yeah.

949
01:30:00,992 --> 01:30:03,961
3PO was a little stuck-up.

950
01:30:04,062 --> 01:30:05,154
Yeah.

951
01:30:05,297 --> 01:30:07,356
I like R2-D2 better.

952
01:30:09,501 --> 01:30:10,490
Excuse me.

953
01:30:12,737 --> 01:30:15,001
He seemed more accessible.

954
01:30:17,342 --> 01:30:18,604
Here.

955
01:30:38,230 --> 01:30:39,288
Here! Get back.

956
01:30:39,397 --> 01:30:40,523
Hey, Jerry.

957
01:30:42,234 --> 01:30:44,361
- Hi, Audrey.
- Ready, Emily?

958
01:30:44,503 --> 01:30:45,629
Come on in.

959
01:30:45,737 --> 01:30:48,069
I'm just... I'm smoking.

960
01:30:48,206 --> 01:30:51,073
Well, it's okay, you can smoke inside.

961
01:30:51,209 --> 01:30:52,403
Okay.

962
01:30:52,677 --> 01:30:55,544
So he does not pay, right?

963
01:30:56,515 --> 01:30:58,506
So, essentially, we are...

964
01:31:05,123 --> 01:31:06,681
- Hi, Diane.
- Hi!

965
01:31:06,791 --> 01:31:07,917
Hi.

966
01:31:09,928 --> 01:31:12,726
- How you doing?
- Feeling better.

967
01:31:14,866 --> 01:31:16,766
Good. You look better.

968
01:31:16,902 --> 01:31:18,199
Thanks.

969
01:31:22,474 --> 01:31:23,907
He's so wrong.

970
01:31:25,644 --> 01:31:26,838
What?

971
01:31:28,146 --> 01:31:31,707
"R2-D2 is more accessible?"

972
01:31:38,490 --> 01:31:41,084
So it wasn't a hallucination, huh?

973
01:31:41,226 --> 01:31:43,558
No. That was my son.

974
01:31:47,499 --> 01:31:50,764
He was so cute.
Brought me a cookie and water.

975
01:31:55,941 --> 01:31:57,704
Hold on, excuse me.

976
01:31:59,144 --> 01:32:01,305
Dory! What did your mother say?

977
01:32:01,446 --> 01:32:03,812
What did your mother say?
What did your mother say?

978
01:32:08,186 --> 01:32:10,586
You wanna sit and have some dinner?

979
01:32:10,689 --> 01:32:14,420
I think you should eat, you know?
Maybe you can keep it down.

980
01:32:14,526 --> 01:32:15,823
I'll try.

981
01:32:29,341 --> 01:32:31,070
See how he's spinning around like that?

982
01:32:31,176 --> 01:32:32,404
Brian used to do the same thing.

983
01:32:32,510 --> 01:32:35,001
Basketball games,
soccer games, any game.

984
01:32:35,146 --> 01:32:36,340
I know.

985
01:32:41,886 --> 01:32:43,751
I miss the silliness,

986
01:32:47,359 --> 01:32:48,690
the fun.

987
01:32:56,368 --> 01:33:01,101
I don't know if I'm ever gonna feel
happy again.

988
01:33:07,245 --> 01:33:10,146
Am I ever gonna feel beautiful?

989
01:33:10,248 --> 01:33:12,045
You are beautiful.

990
01:33:15,053 --> 01:33:17,180
No, I mean on the inside.

991
01:33:19,991 --> 01:33:23,188
You're the most beautiful woman
I've ever seen.

992
01:33:34,272 --> 01:33:35,830
- Hey.
- Hey.

993
01:33:36,741 --> 01:33:38,538
What are you doing here?

994
01:33:38,677 --> 01:33:40,304
I invited her.

995
01:33:50,755 --> 01:33:51,881
- Howard?
- Yeah?

996
01:33:52,023 --> 01:33:54,014
Can we swim in the pool tomorrow?

997
01:33:56,227 --> 01:33:59,719
I'm sorry, Dory,
but I don't live there anymore.

998
01:33:59,864 --> 01:34:00,888
Why?

999
01:34:01,032 --> 01:34:06,163
Well, because my soon to be ex-wife is
gonna get the house.

1000
01:34:07,472 --> 01:34:10,737
Honey, we'll find another place to swim.
Okay?

1001
01:34:10,875 --> 01:34:12,365
What kind of music
did your husband like?

1002
01:34:12,477 --> 01:34:14,741
Did he like classical music?

1003
01:34:19,217 --> 01:34:20,343
Yeah.

1004
01:34:21,486 --> 01:34:23,852
What did he drink after dinner?

1005
01:34:25,323 --> 01:34:28,224
Coffee? Italian wine? Or nothing?

1006
01:34:33,164 --> 01:34:37,123
Chocolate milk.
He loved chocolate milk.

1007
01:34:41,172 --> 01:34:43,970
- What kind of toothpaste did he use?
- Crest.

1008
01:34:46,745 --> 01:34:48,212
He... Crest.

1009
01:34:50,949 --> 01:34:53,941
Come on, ask me a question, Kelly.

1010
01:34:54,085 --> 01:34:57,248
Okay, what was his favorite movie?

1011
01:34:58,323 --> 01:34:59,984
I can't remember.

1012
01:35:00,458 --> 01:35:04,622
<i>He liked this really old boring one,
with the guy from Meet the Fockers.</i>

1013
01:35:06,197 --> 01:35:07,494
<i>Godfather II.</i>

1014
01:35:07,632 --> 01:35:09,293
- It was One, actually.
- Yeah.

1015
01:35:09,434 --> 01:35:10,423
No, he liked Two.

1016
01:35:10,535 --> 01:35:11,763
My dad shot a squirrel.

1017
01:35:11,870 --> 01:35:13,599
- He did?
- Yeah.

1018
01:35:13,705 --> 01:35:16,765
He killed it. He cried a lot.

1019
01:35:18,343 --> 01:35:20,072
He was nine.

1020
01:35:20,178 --> 01:35:22,669
- We had a fire.
- You did?

1021
01:35:22,814 --> 01:35:24,839
Yeah.

1022
01:35:24,983 --> 01:35:26,507
How did it happen?

1023
01:35:26,651 --> 01:35:27,948
It was electrical.

1024
01:35:28,052 --> 01:35:31,954
- The garage door opener went kaput.
- Oh, yeah.

1025
01:35:35,059 --> 01:35:38,517
- Yeah.
- My dad wasn't upset, but my mom was.

1026
01:35:41,166 --> 01:35:42,326
Yeah.

1027
01:35:44,669 --> 01:35:50,505
We lost so many things, I mean,
baby clothes, our photo albums.

1028
01:35:50,642 --> 01:35:51,631
My bike.

1029
01:35:51,743 --> 01:35:56,703
Your bike, important papers,
everything, just...

1030
01:35:58,316 --> 01:36:01,046
We lost a lot. And I remember, I...

1031
01:36:04,722 --> 01:36:08,954
I went to him and I said, you know,
"How can you be so calm?"

1032
01:36:09,994 --> 01:36:13,794
And he said, "Hey, you know,
those are just things, Audrey.

1033
01:36:13,898 --> 01:36:16,662
"Those are just the stuff.
That's just stuff.

1034
01:36:16,768 --> 01:36:18,963
"We still have each other."

1035
01:36:44,028 --> 01:36:45,188
Hi.

1036
01:36:48,066 --> 01:36:49,533
Are you okay?

1037
01:36:53,571 --> 01:36:55,198
This is a list

1038
01:36:59,077 --> 01:37:01,944
of all the things we lost in the fire.

1039
01:37:10,955 --> 01:37:12,388
He's gone.

1040
01:37:19,230 --> 01:37:20,629
He's gone.

1041
01:38:18,356 --> 01:38:21,951
Jerry! Why? Why?

1042
01:38:23,227 --> 01:38:28,859
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

1043
01:38:37,041 --> 01:38:38,941
It's gonna be okay.

1044
01:39:59,323 --> 01:40:00,551
Audrey?

1045
01:40:00,658 --> 01:40:03,923
Yeah? I'm back here. In Dory's room.

1046
01:40:05,797 --> 01:40:07,594
Harper told me you wanted to see me.

1047
01:40:07,732 --> 01:40:11,725
Hey, come on. Sit down.

1048
01:40:21,279 --> 01:40:25,045
So I spoke to Kelly.

1049
01:40:27,652 --> 01:40:28,880
And...

1050
01:40:30,621 --> 01:40:34,717
She said that this, you know...

1051
01:40:34,826 --> 01:40:40,890
This facility, or rehab place
really worked for her.

1052
01:40:43,201 --> 01:40:44,327
So...

1053
01:40:47,438 --> 01:40:53,468
Now, I was kind of thinking
that maybe you should go and...

1054
01:40:53,611 --> 01:40:58,480
Audrey, you've already done
enough for me.

1055
01:41:00,118 --> 01:41:02,780
Right. Okay, but, look,
if you're gonna make this about money,

1056
01:41:02,887 --> 01:41:04,616
then I'm gonna be pissed.

1057
01:41:04,722 --> 01:41:06,587
Now, if you wanna make it
about something else,

1058
01:41:06,691 --> 01:41:10,024
I mean, I don't know, whatever,
I'm gonna hate it,

1059
01:41:10,528 --> 01:41:14,464
but, you know, I guess I can accept that.

1060
01:41:31,082 --> 01:41:35,781
You know, Brian used to say something
to the kids all the time.

1061
01:41:37,922 --> 01:41:39,787
"Accept the good."

1062
01:41:44,829 --> 01:41:46,797
Accept the good, Jerry.

1063
01:41:57,575 --> 01:41:59,634
Do they glow in the dark?

1064
01:42:03,681 --> 01:42:06,809
Yeah. They're fluorescent.

1065
01:42:23,100 --> 01:42:24,260
Okay.

1066
01:42:27,305 --> 01:42:29,830
I'll go, but under one condition.

1067
01:42:29,941 --> 01:42:32,774
When I come out, I'm gonna get a job,

1068
01:42:32,910 --> 01:42:38,348
and I'm gonna pay you back, down
to the last penny, and you will take it.

1069
01:42:42,954 --> 01:42:44,251
Promise?

1070
01:43:00,571 --> 01:43:02,596
Hey, Harp.

1071
01:43:02,740 --> 01:43:05,072
Hi, Jerry. Wanna play?

1072
01:43:07,511 --> 01:43:10,309
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- Yeah.

1073
01:43:15,453 --> 01:43:16,784
Okay, here it is.

1074
01:43:18,489 --> 01:43:22,687
I'm gonna be leaving soon.
I'm gonna go to a sort of hospital.

1075
01:43:24,929 --> 01:43:28,092
- For how long?
- Well, I don't know.

1076
01:43:29,300 --> 01:43:33,794
But when I get out, I'm gonna have
my own place and you can come visit.

1077
01:43:37,241 --> 01:43:40,301
You mean
you're not staying here anymore?

1078
01:43:40,444 --> 01:43:41,604
No.

1079
01:43:44,615 --> 01:43:46,139
Why the face?

1080
01:43:47,852 --> 01:43:50,753
That's how it was always gonna be.

1081
01:43:50,855 --> 01:43:54,552
No! You can't just come here
and pretend to be my dad and leave!

1082
01:43:57,929 --> 01:44:02,127
Harper, I never pretended
to be your daddy.

1083
01:44:13,878 --> 01:44:15,175
Where's your sister?

1084
01:44:15,313 --> 01:44:18,339
She locked herself in her room.
She's mad.

1085
01:44:19,550 --> 01:44:22,417
- Why? She's mad at you?
- No. You.

1086
01:44:25,323 --> 01:44:26,654
She's mad at me, huh?

1087
01:44:26,791 --> 01:44:28,816
She doesn't wanna talk to anyone.

1088
01:44:28,960 --> 01:44:31,929
Okay, watch your hand. Scram.

1089
01:44:44,675 --> 01:44:45,699
Jerry!

1090
01:44:46,811 --> 01:44:48,540
Jerry. Man.

1091
01:44:50,982 --> 01:44:53,382
I thought I was gonna miss you.

1092
01:44:56,921 --> 01:44:59,856
- I'm proud of you, man.
- Thank you.

1093
01:45:03,594 --> 01:45:05,721
I'm going back to my wife.

1094
01:45:09,400 --> 01:45:11,868
I'm lonely as fuck in town, man.

1095
01:45:14,038 --> 01:45:15,130
Okay.

1096
01:45:17,408 --> 01:45:18,670
Howard?

1097
01:45:20,845 --> 01:45:22,210
Thank you.

1098
01:45:43,734 --> 01:45:44,826
Harper?

1099
01:45:47,138 --> 01:45:50,574
I want to say goodbye.
Can you take a look at this note?

1100
01:46:05,623 --> 01:46:07,022
I love you.

1101
01:46:26,110 --> 01:46:27,270
Hey.

1102
01:46:44,995 --> 01:46:48,226
Are you gonna be my friend
when you get better?

1103
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,127
I'm gonna be your friend forever.

1104
01:46:52,269 --> 01:46:54,328
Like you were with my dad?

1105
01:46:55,506 --> 01:46:56,632
You bet.

1106
01:46:58,209 --> 01:47:00,302
Now give me a real kiss.

1107
01:47:00,444 --> 01:47:01,809
Good. Okay.

1108
01:47:21,398 --> 01:47:24,993
Wait! Wait!

1109
01:47:29,974 --> 01:47:31,134
Wait!

1110
01:47:32,643 --> 01:47:34,611
Wait! Jerry!

1111
01:47:36,747 --> 01:47:38,044
Hey!

1112
01:48:30,367 --> 01:48:33,495
Hi, my name is Jerry and I'm an addict.

1113
01:48:33,604 --> 01:48:35,697
- Hi, Jerry.
- Hello, Jerry.

1114
01:48:38,142 --> 01:48:41,873
I've been clean for 89 days.

1115
01:48:41,979 --> 01:48:43,913
My mind is clearer,

1116
01:48:48,419 --> 01:48:50,751
and I think it's getting better.

1117
01:48:50,888 --> 01:48:53,448
Every day, a little bit.

1118
01:48:53,591 --> 01:48:56,856
But I wanna talk about this dream
I keep having.

1119
01:48:59,163 --> 01:49:02,690
It always starts
with me stealing silverware.

1120
01:49:02,800 --> 01:49:06,793
<i>Then I go sell it to this guy</i>

1121
01:49:06,937 --> 01:49:10,737
<i>who I used to know
who owned a catering service.</i>

1122
01:49:12,743 --> 01:49:17,544
Then with the money, I go to this place
where I used to buy my drug of choice,

1123
01:49:20,918 --> 01:49:23,978
and he's not around.

1124
01:49:26,957 --> 01:49:29,425
So I go to other spots, right,

1125
01:49:30,527 --> 01:49:35,590
but for some reason, no one is around.

1126
01:49:38,202 --> 01:49:40,898
<i>All of Seattle is dry,</i>

1127
01:49:41,005 --> 01:49:45,942
and then I get that feeling, the dread,

1128
01:49:50,381 --> 01:49:52,076
and I panic.

1129
01:49:56,854 --> 01:49:58,412
And I start running,

1130
01:50:00,658 --> 01:50:03,752
<i>and it's raining, and it gets dark.</i>

1131
01:50:05,796 --> 01:50:10,165
<i>And then I'm in my old apartment,
and I'm thrashing right through it,</i>

1132
01:50:11,302 --> 01:50:14,499
<i>looking for something
I might have stashed away.</i>

1133
01:50:18,042 --> 01:50:20,510
And I think I'm having a seizure.

1134
01:50:23,814 --> 01:50:27,648
And then I find a balloon
hidden in my suitcase.

1135
01:50:49,206 --> 01:50:50,798
So there I am

1136
01:50:53,410 --> 01:50:55,844
with a bag of junk in one hand

1137
01:50:56,880 --> 01:51:00,008
and the money for my next fix
in the other,

1138
01:51:00,117 --> 01:51:03,848
and I feel at total, utter peace.

1139
01:51:13,697 --> 01:51:15,187
And I wake up.

1140
01:51:19,436 --> 01:51:21,165
<i>One day at a time.</i>

1141
01:51:24,308 --> 01:51:26,037
<i>One day at a time.</i>

1142
01:51:32,049 --> 01:51:33,744
One day at a time.

1143
01:51:37,921 --> 01:51:39,684
<i>One day at a time.</i>

1144
01:51:46,897 --> 01:51:48,262
Thank you.
