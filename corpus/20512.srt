1
00:01:16,355 --> 00:01:18,585
Yeah! Go, buddy, go!

2
00:01:19,524 --> 00:01:22,015
That baby's going scared!

3
00:01:49,688 --> 00:01:51,019
Give me one.

4
00:01:51,189 --> 00:01:52,349
Get them.

5
00:01:52,524 --> 00:01:53,582
Hey, boys!

6
00:01:54,092 --> 00:01:55,855
How y'all doing?

7
00:01:56,194 --> 00:01:59,595
What are you looking at?
You want to get shot?!

8
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,089
Go, baby!

9
00:02:04,936 --> 00:02:06,597
-You got it!
-Pearl Harbor!

10
00:02:19,384 --> 00:02:21,045
Here's another one!

11
00:02:21,219 --> 00:02:22,208
Watch this!

12
00:02:22,788 --> 00:02:23,948
100 points!

13
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:37,564
It's a beautiful day, isn't it?

14
00:03:03,428 --> 00:03:04,827
Bye, Tonya.

15
00:03:16,174 --> 00:03:17,937
Clean up that mess, boy.

16
00:03:20,779 --> 00:03:21,609
Hungry?

17
00:03:24,449 --> 00:03:25,780
You're having nothing?

18
00:03:25,951 --> 00:03:27,680
I'm having them.

19
00:03:29,788 --> 00:03:31,619
Shit.

20
00:03:31,857 --> 00:03:33,290
Bye, girls.

21
00:03:33,792 --> 00:03:35,020
Let's go!

22
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:39,119
You're on the house.

23
00:03:39,297 --> 00:03:40,628
Harry Rex!

24
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:42,699
All those weekends...

25
00:03:42,868 --> 00:03:43,857
...fishing...

26
00:03:44,035 --> 00:03:46,697
...lounging, opportunities lost...

27
00:03:46,872 --> 00:03:48,703
...to renovate yourself.

28
00:03:48,874 --> 00:03:50,865
Tragic, just tragic, Jake.

29
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:55,312
Makes Carla happy.

30
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:58,643
Spent 4 marriages trying to figure
out what makes women happy.

31
00:03:58,817 --> 00:04:02,548
You spent 4 marriages trying to
figure out what makes you happy.

32
00:04:04,489 --> 00:04:05,478
Maybe that's it.

33
00:04:05,657 --> 00:04:06,988
Yeah, maybe.

34
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:07,887
Swiggy?

35
00:04:08,059 --> 00:04:10,050
Lord, let my car be fixed today.

36
00:04:10,228 --> 00:04:11,320
Oh, dear.

37
00:04:27,412 --> 00:04:28,401
Who's that?

38
00:04:31,349 --> 00:04:32,077
She's young.

39
00:04:33,518 --> 00:04:34,246
Hold this.

40
00:04:34,419 --> 00:04:35,681
What're you doing?

41
00:04:35,854 --> 00:04:39,085
If they're old enough to crawl,
they're in the right position.

42
00:04:39,257 --> 00:04:40,519
What're you doing?

43
00:04:40,692 --> 00:04:42,250
What're you going to do?

44
00:04:49,034 --> 00:04:50,695
50 points!

45
00:04:50,869 --> 00:04:52,200
You good, boy!

46
00:04:53,438 --> 00:04:54,268
Shut up!

47
00:04:55,407 --> 00:04:56,738
Daddy!

48
00:04:58,610 --> 00:04:59,770
Go, bud.

49
00:05:00,278 --> 00:05:01,040
Shut up!

50
00:05:02,447 --> 00:05:03,539
Shut up!

51
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:05,778
I'll kill you.

52
00:05:05,951 --> 00:05:06,576
My turn.

53
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:09,950
There you are.

54
00:05:10,121 --> 00:05:11,213
Shut up!

55
00:05:11,723 --> 00:05:12,553
Daddy!

56
00:05:23,935 --> 00:05:25,266
Mama!

57
00:05:37,148 --> 00:05:37,910
What is this?

58
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:39,482
Groceries!

59
00:05:39,651 --> 00:05:41,141
Y'all see her?

60
00:06:23,695 --> 00:06:26,186
How many appointments
do we have today?

61
00:06:26,364 --> 00:06:28,195
Not a one.

62
00:06:28,366 --> 00:06:31,358
But it is the first of the
month again and guess what.

63
00:06:31,536 --> 00:06:35,700
The checks are pouring in.
We have enough money to pay our debts.

64
00:06:35,874 --> 00:06:37,705
That'll be your last drink.

65
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:41,477
Just keep us no more than one
month behind on any vendor.

66
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,142
You have been drinking.

67
00:06:43,882 --> 00:06:44,974
2 months.

68
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:48,051
These are the most delinquent.
The rent's in there.

69
00:06:49,554 --> 00:06:52,045
I appreciate the practice, Captain.

70
00:06:52,223 --> 00:06:54,555
But you could've left me a few clients.

71
00:07:02,233 --> 00:07:04,724
Baby, here's Daddy coming.

72
00:07:13,578 --> 00:07:15,910
I'm here, baby. Daddy's here.

73
00:07:17,082 --> 00:07:17,912
Daddy...

74
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:21,018
...l'm sorry I dropped the groceries.

75
00:07:21,186 --> 00:07:24,849
That's all right, baby.
That's all right, baby.

76
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:26,682
That's all right.

77
00:07:52,917 --> 00:07:54,248
Look at this.

78
00:08:22,247 --> 00:08:23,305
Billy Ray.

79
00:08:24,082 --> 00:08:28,075
Sorry, sir, but we don't allow
no African-Americans here.

80
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,909
Billy Ray Cobb...

81
00:08:30,088 --> 00:08:31,988
...you and Willard must come with me.

82
00:08:32,824 --> 00:08:34,416
I ain't moving.

83
00:08:34,592 --> 00:08:36,753
The girl you took for a ride...

84
00:08:37,662 --> 00:08:38,424
What girl?

85
00:08:38,596 --> 00:08:40,996
I got bad news for you. She didn't die.

86
00:08:41,433 --> 00:08:45,665
So unless there's another redneck
asshole with a yellow truck...

87
00:08:45,837 --> 00:08:48,101
...with a Confederate flag--

88
00:08:48,273 --> 00:08:49,262
Blue gums...

89
00:08:49,441 --> 00:08:51,671
...get out of here and grab a branch.

90
00:08:51,843 --> 00:08:55,609
Unless you got an explanation for
why this was in your truck...

91
00:08:56,848 --> 00:08:57,678
...you're going to jail.

92
00:08:57,849 --> 00:08:58,838
Get up.

93
00:09:00,285 --> 00:09:02,014
You go to hell, nigger.

94
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,452
Goddamn!

95
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:06,623
Come here.

96
00:09:09,194 --> 00:09:12,095
Now, you earn the
right to remain silent!

97
00:09:12,464 --> 00:09:14,364
Here, just like you like them.

98
00:09:15,533 --> 00:09:18,297
-Sugar, today I'm going to have--
-Go to hell.

99
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:20,631
I'll just watch baby eat his.

100
00:09:20,805 --> 00:09:23,035
I didn't handle her husband's divorce.

101
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:25,142
I'm shriveling away here.

102
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:26,368
I'm shriveling.

103
00:09:28,146 --> 00:09:29,545
What's up?

104
00:09:30,215 --> 00:09:33,150
Didn't you defend Billy
Ray Cobb a few years back?

105
00:09:34,385 --> 00:09:35,374
What for?

106
00:09:36,654 --> 00:09:38,053
Caught him selling dope.

107
00:09:38,223 --> 00:09:40,487
Spent time in Parchman.
Got out last year.

108
00:09:41,059 --> 00:09:43,721
I think some Memphis
lawyer handled that.

109
00:09:43,895 --> 00:09:45,157
Why do you ask?

110
00:09:45,663 --> 00:09:48,325
Picked him up for rape.
Him and Willard.

111
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,660
Who'd they rape?

112
00:09:51,069 --> 00:09:52,832
You know Carl Lee Hailey?

113
00:09:53,004 --> 00:09:55,063
I defended his brother Lester.

114
00:09:57,342 --> 00:09:59,173
It was his little girl.

115
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,342
Little Tonya?

116
00:10:08,853 --> 00:10:09,911
How old's she?

117
00:10:11,422 --> 00:10:12,855
She's ten.

118
00:10:55,633 --> 00:10:56,964
Mr. Willard...

119
00:10:57,135 --> 00:10:58,625
...l'm Sheriff Walls.

120
00:10:59,137 --> 00:11:01,571
My mama voted for you.

121
00:11:03,408 --> 00:11:05,569
I seen you play for the Rams.

122
00:11:07,745 --> 00:11:11,579
Way I figure, a nigger
sheriff's okay, been on TV.

123
00:11:14,419 --> 00:11:15,818
No offense.

124
00:11:19,157 --> 00:11:20,647
What's your full name?

125
00:11:21,092 --> 00:11:22,923
James Lewis Willard.

126
00:11:26,864 --> 00:11:29,128
4, which is a difference of 110.60.

127
00:11:33,871 --> 00:11:35,304
Who's there?

128
00:11:54,592 --> 00:11:55,889
Carl Lee.

129
00:12:01,899 --> 00:12:03,161
How is she?

130
00:12:04,602 --> 00:12:06,502
She's holding on.

131
00:12:07,739 --> 00:12:10,606
Doctor says she ain't out
of the woods yet, though.

132
00:12:18,116 --> 00:12:20,744
They worked her over something good.

133
00:12:28,192 --> 00:12:32,754
You remember them 4 white boys
raped that black girl last year?

134
00:12:38,436 --> 00:12:40,028
They got off, didn't they?

135
00:12:50,882 --> 00:12:53,715
I was in a jam, you'd help
me out, wouldn't you?

136
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,779
Sure, Carl Lee.

137
00:12:59,891 --> 00:13:01,882
What kind of jam you talking of?

138
00:13:02,894 --> 00:13:05,055
You got a daughter, Jake.

139
00:13:05,296 --> 00:13:06,888
What would you do?

140
00:13:17,809 --> 00:13:19,902
You dream some good dreams.

141
00:13:20,078 --> 00:13:21,909
Good night, Daddy.

142
00:13:22,914 --> 00:13:24,245
Night, baby.

143
00:13:40,498 --> 00:13:42,489
Is she asleep?

144
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:43,928
She's so sweet.

145
00:13:44,102 --> 00:13:45,763
Yeah, she is...

146
00:13:45,937 --> 00:13:47,336
...next to you.

147
00:13:48,106 --> 00:13:51,507
When I look at her though, I
cannot help but think about...

148
00:13:51,709 --> 00:13:52,767
...Tonya.

149
00:13:54,345 --> 00:13:55,277
Don't.

150
00:13:58,783 --> 00:14:00,842
Don't do that to yourself.

151
00:14:07,024 --> 00:14:08,116
Something wrong?

152
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,225
Tonya's father...

153
00:14:11,529 --> 00:14:13,292
...Carl Lee Hailey...

154
00:14:13,798 --> 00:14:15,288
...came to the office today.

155
00:14:17,468 --> 00:14:19,868
Man's heart is torn wide open, baby.

156
00:14:20,238 --> 00:14:21,796
I don't know, but...

157
00:14:21,973 --> 00:14:24,464
...seemed like he was
going to do something.

158
00:14:24,876 --> 00:14:26,241
Like what?

159
00:14:27,745 --> 00:14:29,975
Something like killing those boys.

160
00:14:30,648 --> 00:14:31,979
Was he serious?

161
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,879
I don't know. I don't know.

162
00:14:38,055 --> 00:14:40,046
It could be just hurt talking.

163
00:14:41,392 --> 00:14:44,657
But when you think it's
possible those two animals could...

164
00:14:45,163 --> 00:14:46,755
...go free...

165
00:14:47,899 --> 00:14:49,833
...and be walking the streets....

166
00:14:55,339 --> 00:14:56,670
I don't know.

167
00:14:58,509 --> 00:15:02,502
After what that man has been through,
he's capable of anything.

168
00:15:03,681 --> 00:15:05,774
Somebody should do something.

169
00:15:06,584 --> 00:15:08,518
You should call Sheriff Walls.

170
00:16:06,744 --> 00:16:09,577
...to release the
owner from assessment.

171
00:16:13,484 --> 00:16:15,349
I hope I'm having a heart attack...

172
00:16:15,486 --> 00:16:17,647
...'cause then I get to sue you!

173
00:16:18,089 --> 00:16:20,922
Don't stand on ceremony, come on in.

174
00:16:21,092 --> 00:16:22,992
What? No clients?

175
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:26,152
Just waiting to pick yours up on appeal.

176
00:16:26,364 --> 00:16:28,924
And you, are you on vacation?

177
00:16:29,934 --> 00:16:32,266
Fortunately for me, my lovely...

178
00:16:32,603 --> 00:16:34,764
...divorce doesn't go on vacation.

179
00:16:35,006 --> 00:16:36,598
However...

180
00:16:36,774 --> 00:16:40,369
...not even the richest, most
ridiculous settlement I get...

181
00:16:40,511 --> 00:16:44,106
...will be as satisfying as
watching those two hyenas...

182
00:16:44,448 --> 00:16:46,507
...get what's coming to them.

183
00:16:51,289 --> 00:16:52,620
Oh, dear.

184
00:16:55,293 --> 00:16:58,285
I'm a fool for those
German-type convertibles.

185
00:17:01,132 --> 00:17:03,396
Come on, let's get to court.

186
00:17:03,534 --> 00:17:06,401
Lucien thinks the two
hyenas just might get off.

187
00:17:06,537 --> 00:17:07,902
You saw Lucien?

188
00:17:08,205 --> 00:17:09,797
When? Where?

189
00:17:09,974 --> 00:17:11,134
How is he?

190
00:17:11,309 --> 00:17:13,209
Has he been eating better?

191
00:17:15,913 --> 00:17:17,471
Just curious.

192
00:17:19,617 --> 00:17:24,418
Refresh my recollection, how long
were you and Lucien together?

193
00:17:24,555 --> 00:17:27,991
We were never together.
I was his secretary for 20 years.

194
00:17:28,159 --> 00:17:30,059
Come on, old girl.

195
00:17:30,227 --> 00:17:31,216
You can tell us.

196
00:17:31,429 --> 00:17:32,726
He was your boyfriend.

197
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:36,730
I am an upstanding, God-fearing,
respectable woman...

198
00:17:36,934 --> 00:17:40,995
...with unimpeachable morals who
has been happily married 27 years.

199
00:17:41,172 --> 00:17:45,074
And I have never had or ever
will have any boyfriend!

200
00:17:45,443 --> 00:17:46,740
And if I did...

201
00:17:46,944 --> 00:17:51,506
...it would not be that old
pickled scoundrel Lucien Wilbanks!

202
00:17:56,253 --> 00:17:58,517
-She did him, a lot.
-Definitely.

203
00:18:05,663 --> 00:18:06,891
Step back.

204
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:10,463
Come on out.

205
00:18:13,804 --> 00:18:15,965
Boys, today's your big day.

206
00:18:16,173 --> 00:18:19,904
We'll go to the courthouse,
the judge will set your bail...

207
00:18:20,077 --> 00:18:22,739
...then we'll come back,
nice and peaceful.

208
00:18:22,913 --> 00:18:26,974
If I get any trouble out of you,
I'm going to integrate this jail.

209
00:19:54,071 --> 00:19:56,403
Mama, Daddy's home!

210
00:19:58,075 --> 00:20:01,408
Hannah, let's go inside for a minute.

211
00:20:03,681 --> 00:20:06,081
Let's find a book.

212
00:20:39,817 --> 00:20:43,218
Jake, are you hurt?
Jake, what happened to you?!

213
00:20:43,554 --> 00:20:46,216
Honey, are you okay?
What happened to you?

214
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:49,826
What is this? What is
going on with you?!

215
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:52,326
Jake, baby, are you okay?

216
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:54,393
What happened?

217
00:21:46,283 --> 00:21:47,443
I'll see you.

218
00:22:01,398 --> 00:22:02,797
Will the sheriff comment?

219
00:22:02,967 --> 00:22:04,958
He might make a statement, or not.

220
00:22:05,135 --> 00:22:06,966
-Is it first-degree murder?
-I don't know.

221
00:22:09,406 --> 00:22:10,964
Here comes the sheriff.

222
00:22:11,141 --> 00:22:13,302
I got no comment. No comment.

223
00:22:13,477 --> 00:22:16,412
Hey, Jake. Carl Lee
said you'd be coming.

224
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,648
Are you an attorney?

225
00:22:18,816 --> 00:22:22,718
I'll make a statement.
Get these vans out of here.

226
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:25,218
Give us something for our newscasts.

227
00:22:44,942 --> 00:22:46,842
Didn't think I'd do it, did you?

228
00:22:50,581 --> 00:22:52,173
How you holding up?

229
00:22:56,587 --> 00:23:00,182
I ain't had nothing against them
till they messed with my baby.

230
00:23:00,858 --> 00:23:04,692
And I feel sorry for their
mamas and their daddys, but...

231
00:23:05,863 --> 00:23:08,024
...l ain't sorry for what I done.

232
00:23:11,101 --> 00:23:12,363
How's Looney?

233
00:23:14,972 --> 00:23:17,031
You blew his knee off his leg.

234
00:23:17,875 --> 00:23:19,706
Doctors are still with him.

235
00:23:24,114 --> 00:23:25,706
What'll happen to me?

236
00:23:27,051 --> 00:23:31,385
There's going to be a preliminary
hearing. Probably tomorrow.

237
00:23:32,222 --> 00:23:34,554
Then Buckley'll push for a fast trial.

238
00:23:35,492 --> 00:23:36,720
Who's Buckley?

239
00:23:36,894 --> 00:23:38,225
Rufus Buckley...

240
00:23:38,495 --> 00:23:39,553
...district attorney.

241
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:43,723
He's mean, he's ambitious and he'll
eat this up because of the publicity.

242
00:23:43,901 --> 00:23:45,732
But you've beat him?

243
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:47,230
Yeah.

244
00:23:48,072 --> 00:23:49,903
Not in a murder case.

245
00:23:53,577 --> 00:23:55,238
Think I can win?

246
00:23:56,013 --> 00:23:58,504
All depends on the jury, Carl Lee.

247
00:23:59,516 --> 00:24:01,507
Pick the right jury, and you'll walk.

248
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:04,913
DA picks the jury and...

249
00:24:05,089 --> 00:24:06,420
...you get the gas.

250
00:24:11,595 --> 00:24:13,756
How much a case like this cost?

251
00:24:16,667 --> 00:24:18,157
Probably 50 grand.

252
00:24:20,771 --> 00:24:22,762
I can pay maybe ten.

253
00:24:30,047 --> 00:24:31,105
There're not a...

254
00:24:31,849 --> 00:24:35,285
...lot of white lawyers would've
took my brother's case.

255
00:24:35,686 --> 00:24:38,052
You did and got him off.

256
00:24:38,856 --> 00:24:41,051
I figure there's people out there...

257
00:24:41,191 --> 00:24:44,558
...tired of all the
raping and killing and...

258
00:24:44,695 --> 00:24:48,859
...they'd be sympathetic to a man who
took the law into his own hands...

259
00:24:49,066 --> 00:24:50,693
...even if he is black.

260
00:24:57,808 --> 00:25:01,300
You said you'd help me
out if I was in a jam.

261
00:25:02,079 --> 00:25:04,309
Well, I'm in one now.

262
00:25:05,983 --> 00:25:07,314
What do you say?

263
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:11,811
What can you tell us, sheriff?

264
00:25:11,989 --> 00:25:12,819
Comment?

265
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:14,582
Are you with the police?

266
00:25:14,725 --> 00:25:15,817
I'm a lawyer.

267
00:25:15,993 --> 00:25:17,722
Are you Hailey's attorney?

268
00:25:18,595 --> 00:25:20,722
Are you Mr. Hailey's attorney?

269
00:25:21,331 --> 00:25:22,491
Yes, I am.

270
00:25:22,666 --> 00:25:23,496
Your name?

271
00:25:23,667 --> 00:25:26,363
Brigance. Jake Brigance.
That's with one 'G.'

272
00:25:34,044 --> 00:25:35,534
Hailey's hired an attorney.

273
00:25:36,213 --> 00:25:37,305
Jake Brigance.

274
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:42,812
And today ain't even my birthday.

275
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:46,812
Brigance couldn't tie his
own tie without Wilbanks.

276
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:48,890
He's never lost a murder case.

277
00:25:49,059 --> 00:25:52,825
Well, he's never tried one against me.
What time's the preliminary?

278
00:25:52,996 --> 00:25:55,829
Tomorrow at 3. Judge
Omar Noose presiding.

279
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,891
I was wrong. It is my birthday.

280
00:25:59,236 --> 00:26:00,066
All right.

281
00:26:00,237 --> 00:26:02,831
First, Brigance will file
for a change of venue.

282
00:26:03,006 --> 00:26:04,405
He'd be a fool not to.

283
00:26:04,842 --> 00:26:06,070
Why's that?

284
00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:07,399
Why?

285
00:26:07,578 --> 00:26:10,342
Should we tell our young,
uninformed law clerk...

286
00:26:10,514 --> 00:26:12,573
...the reality of jurisprudence?

287
00:26:12,749 --> 00:26:16,742
Evelyn, get me the state
file on race statistics!

288
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,581
See, it's quite simple.

289
00:26:18,755 --> 00:26:21,747
This county's 26-30\/\
black, give or take.

290
00:26:21,925 --> 00:26:26,021
Almost every other county is
40-45, in some cases 70\/\ black.

291
00:26:26,363 --> 00:26:28,422
Blacks are more sympathetic to blacks.

292
00:26:28,599 --> 00:26:33,036
If he gets it moved, he has a greater
chance of color in the jury box.

293
00:26:33,203 --> 00:26:36,366
But if the trial stays here,
it's an all white jury for sure.

294
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:38,098
This is for you...

295
00:26:38,542 --> 00:26:41,204
...to integrate your brain
with before tomorrow.

296
00:26:42,045 --> 00:26:45,776
He means without blacks on the jury,
Hailey hasn't got a chance.

297
00:26:45,949 --> 00:26:47,610
Noose is up for re-elect?

298
00:26:47,784 --> 00:26:49,115
Yeah, November.

299
00:26:49,286 --> 00:26:51,447
Reach out to our legislature friends.

300
00:26:51,622 --> 00:26:55,058
Have them call Noose. We'll help
him decide to keep the trial here.

301
00:26:55,225 --> 00:26:59,127
Also, send a case of whatever
he drinks to Lucien Wilbanks.

302
00:26:59,296 --> 00:27:00,456
Dewars.

303
00:27:00,631 --> 00:27:02,792
Keep that old drunk on the sidelines.

304
00:27:02,966 --> 00:27:03,955
Get me Sam.

305
00:27:04,134 --> 00:27:05,465
And, gentlemen...

306
00:27:07,304 --> 00:27:08,794
...no mistakes.

307
00:27:08,972 --> 00:27:10,439
This is what we've waited for.

308
00:27:11,241 --> 00:27:13,903
Justifiable homicide'll never hold up.

309
00:27:14,411 --> 00:27:16,811
My only chance is to find a shrink...

310
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:19,471
...to say Carl Lee was
insane at the time.

311
00:27:19,650 --> 00:27:23,245
Now I might know a man
who owes me a favor.

312
00:27:24,588 --> 00:27:26,579
You file for a change of venue?

313
00:27:26,757 --> 00:27:27,746
Of course.

314
00:27:29,259 --> 00:27:31,591
If Judge Noose denies it...

315
00:27:32,095 --> 00:27:35,258
...then you'll get an all
white jury and you'll lose.

316
00:27:35,999 --> 00:27:37,261
Thanks.

317
00:27:37,434 --> 00:27:42,167
Bear in mind that Mr. Hailey is guilty
as sin under our legal system.

318
00:27:42,839 --> 00:27:45,330
It does not permit vigilante violence...

319
00:27:45,509 --> 00:27:48,171
...and he took the law
into his own hands.

320
00:27:48,845 --> 00:27:50,676
He murdered two people.

321
00:27:51,949 --> 00:27:55,783
Two people who raped his
10-year-old daughter.

322
00:27:58,355 --> 00:27:59,617
You know...

323
00:28:00,023 --> 00:28:02,287
...you can win this case...

324
00:28:02,459 --> 00:28:04,450
...and justice will prevail.

325
00:28:04,795 --> 00:28:06,285
But lose...

326
00:28:06,463 --> 00:28:10,524
...and justice will also prevail.
Now that's a strange case.

327
00:28:14,471 --> 00:28:16,132
I could use your help.

328
00:28:19,209 --> 00:28:22,144
The sons-of-bitches
decertified me, Jake.

329
00:28:22,312 --> 00:28:26,305
I swore I will never enter
another courtroom. Ever!

330
00:28:26,984 --> 00:28:29,475
You're the best lawyer I've ever seen.

331
00:28:29,653 --> 00:28:32,486
I know how much it hurt when
they took your license away.

332
00:28:32,656 --> 00:28:35,056
But they can't take your
mind unless you let them.

333
00:28:36,226 --> 00:28:37,557
Good speech.

334
00:28:37,728 --> 00:28:39,559
I had a good teacher.

335
00:28:40,063 --> 00:28:41,724
Remember when I came to you?

336
00:28:43,567 --> 00:28:45,558
In that ridiculous blue suit.

337
00:28:47,237 --> 00:28:49,398
You sat me down and said to me...

338
00:28:49,573 --> 00:28:51,734
..."l cannot promise you riches.

339
00:28:52,009 --> 00:28:53,670
What I can offer you...

340
00:28:53,844 --> 00:28:55,573
...is a chance to save the world...

341
00:28:55,746 --> 00:28:57,179
...one case at a time."

342
00:29:00,183 --> 00:29:02,913
I'm saying the same words
back to you right now.

343
00:29:04,688 --> 00:29:05,916
How about it, Lucien?

344
00:29:09,259 --> 00:29:12,251
"The Lord is my shepherd.
I shall not want.

345
00:29:12,429 --> 00:29:15,421
He maketh me to lie
down in green pastures.

346
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:17,590
He leadeth me beside still waters.

347
00:29:18,035 --> 00:29:19,696
Yea, though I walk...

348
00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:24,034
...through the valley of the shadow
of death, I will fear no evil...

349
00:29:24,541 --> 00:29:26,532
...for Thou art with me.

350
00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:29,611
Thy rod and Thy staff comfort me."

351
00:29:33,216 --> 00:29:35,377
Sure am sorry about your brother.

352
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,278
Old Willard, too.

353
00:29:38,789 --> 00:29:40,381
Good boys both.

354
00:29:45,962 --> 00:29:47,452
10 years ago...

355
00:29:47,631 --> 00:29:50,896
...that nigger'd be hanging
by the end of a rope.

356
00:29:51,068 --> 00:29:53,400
Tell me what's wrong with this country.

357
00:29:54,071 --> 00:29:55,629
Klan would know what to do.

358
00:29:56,807 --> 00:29:58,741
My granddaddy, he was Klan.

359
00:29:59,743 --> 00:30:01,142
Ain't no Klan here.

360
00:30:01,311 --> 00:30:03,643
There's still some boys around.

361
00:30:03,814 --> 00:30:06,408
Skinheads who want to
blow up the government?

362
00:30:06,483 --> 00:30:08,917
No, sir. Good God-fearing Klan.

363
00:30:11,822 --> 00:30:15,656
I got a friend, used to be active.
I could call him.

364
00:30:17,427 --> 00:30:19,156
You do that.

365
00:30:19,596 --> 00:30:22,588
You tell them boys we need
some Klan here in Canton.

366
00:30:22,766 --> 00:30:24,256
I mean, right quick.

367
00:30:28,105 --> 00:30:29,094
Hurry up.

368
00:30:29,272 --> 00:30:30,830
Coming, coming.

369
00:30:33,677 --> 00:30:35,440
Look, there's Ozzie.

370
00:30:37,347 --> 00:30:39,281
To our family's TV debut.

371
00:30:39,449 --> 00:30:41,178
To the big time.

372
00:30:41,952 --> 00:30:45,285
I can't believe he didn't take
you seriously about Carl Lee.

373
00:30:45,455 --> 00:30:49,016
Baby, some folks think those
boys got what they deserved.

374
00:30:49,192 --> 00:30:49,954
Here.

375
00:30:50,127 --> 00:30:54,860
Carl Lee Hailey may spend life in jail.
His family doesn't deserve that.

376
00:30:55,198 --> 00:30:57,132
-You did call Ozzie?
-Look here.

377
00:30:57,634 --> 00:30:59,363
Daddy's on TV.

378
00:30:59,536 --> 00:31:03,302
I'll show the men and women of the South
will look past color and see the truth.

379
00:31:03,473 --> 00:31:07,876
That in the South, justice
is and will be colorblind.

380
00:31:09,546 --> 00:31:13,141
Impressive. Honey,
that was really good.

381
00:31:13,316 --> 00:31:15,546
Isn't Daddy smart?

382
00:31:15,719 --> 00:31:16,708
Brigance.

383
00:31:16,887 --> 00:31:18,821
That was great.

384
00:31:19,222 --> 00:31:20,883
No, we just saw it.

385
00:31:21,057 --> 00:31:22,388
All right, Harry Rex.

386
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:24,220
I'm proud of you.

387
00:31:24,494 --> 00:31:25,825
Good stuff, huh?

388
00:31:26,496 --> 00:31:28,726
Hear this? Think it's a press agent?

389
00:31:28,899 --> 00:31:30,230
Don't be gross.

390
00:31:31,835 --> 00:31:34,065
F. Lee Bailey's office.

391
00:31:34,337 --> 00:31:39,001
You nigger-loving son-of-a-bitch,
you won't live if the nigger walks.

392
00:31:42,679 --> 00:31:45,011
Do you have sympathy for the defense?

393
00:31:45,182 --> 00:31:48,083
Of course I do. You're
a mother, I'm a father.

394
00:31:48,251 --> 00:31:50,845
We all have families. Who wouldn't?

395
00:31:51,087 --> 00:31:53,578
Don't presume the DA is insensitive.

396
00:31:53,757 --> 00:31:58,421
But the people of this state entrusted
this office to uphold the law.

397
00:31:58,595 --> 00:32:03,032
Our society cannot condone men who
take the law into their own hands.

398
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:06,033
If you get a conviction,
will you ask for the gas chamber?

399
00:32:06,203 --> 00:32:08,933
Yes, I will seek the death
penalty for Mr. Hailey.

400
00:32:09,105 --> 00:32:11,039
What do you think of Brigance?

401
00:32:11,208 --> 00:32:13,108
Isn't he still in law school?

402
00:32:13,276 --> 00:32:15,938
Say hey to your husband for me.
That's all.

403
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:32,790
Hey, Cora Mae, don't you worry.
Wayne, how are you?

404
00:32:36,299 --> 00:32:39,462
You plead him guilty, I'll ask
for life. Otherwise, he dies.

405
00:32:39,636 --> 00:32:43,072
You drop your case now, I won't
bury you before the county.

406
00:32:44,407 --> 00:32:45,738
All rise!

407
00:32:47,477 --> 00:32:48,569
Court is in session.

408
00:32:48,745 --> 00:32:51,236
The Honorable Omar Noose presiding.

409
00:32:51,414 --> 00:32:53,814
Good afternoon, citizens.

410
00:32:55,819 --> 00:32:56,979
Be seated.

411
00:32:57,587 --> 00:32:58,815
Counsel.

412
00:32:59,322 --> 00:33:00,983
And you, sir...

413
00:33:01,157 --> 00:33:03,318
...are you Carl Lee Hailey?

414
00:33:05,095 --> 00:33:07,586
I am holding a copy of an indictment...

415
00:33:07,764 --> 00:33:10,096
...returned by the grand jury...

416
00:33:10,267 --> 00:33:12,929
...presenting that "Carl Lee Hailey...

417
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:16,935
...did murder Billy Ray
Cobb, a human being...

418
00:33:17,274 --> 00:33:19,435
...and James Willard, a human being...

419
00:33:19,609 --> 00:33:22,339
...and did attempt to kill
Dwayne Looney...

420
00:33:22,512 --> 00:33:23,604
...a peace officer...

421
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:26,772
...against the peace and
dignity of Mississippi."

422
00:33:27,117 --> 00:33:29,677
Do you understand the
charges against you?

423
00:33:31,288 --> 00:33:32,687
How do you wish to plead?

424
00:33:35,292 --> 00:33:36,623
Not guilty.

425
00:33:38,461 --> 00:33:41,191
The defense enters a plea of not
guilty by reason of insanity.

426
00:33:41,364 --> 00:33:44,299
Your trial is set for July 22.

427
00:33:44,467 --> 00:33:49,131
All pre-trial motions and matters should
be filed by July 8. Anything further?

428
00:33:49,306 --> 00:33:49,965
Yes.

429
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:55,043
The State requests the defendant
be examined by its own doctors.

430
00:33:55,211 --> 00:33:56,200
Granted.

431
00:33:56,379 --> 00:33:59,212
Additionally, the State
opposes any request for bail.

432
00:33:59,549 --> 00:34:02,882
We have not yet asked for bail.
Now Governor Buckley...

433
00:34:03,053 --> 00:34:06,716
...cannot oppose a
request until one is made.

434
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:07,879
Your Honor...

435
00:34:08,058 --> 00:34:12,495
...even Mr. Brigance's meager legal
experience should have taught him...

436
00:34:12,662 --> 00:34:14,823
...l haven't been
elected governor, yet...

437
00:34:14,998 --> 00:34:17,899
...and he is required to request bail.

438
00:34:18,068 --> 00:34:19,660
The State opposes any request.

439
00:34:19,836 --> 00:34:23,237
In the future, why don't we
wait till he makes the request.

440
00:34:23,506 --> 00:34:24,666
Thank you.

441
00:34:24,908 --> 00:34:26,671
We would like to request bail.

442
00:34:26,843 --> 00:34:27,400
Denied.

443
00:34:28,678 --> 00:34:30,236
I never allow bail...

444
00:34:30,413 --> 00:34:34,406
...in a murder case and don't feel
an exception is called for today.

445
00:34:34,684 --> 00:34:38,017
Good enough. We will be
filing for a change of venue.

446
00:34:38,188 --> 00:34:39,678
I anticipated this.

447
00:34:39,856 --> 00:34:43,849
Let me save you some time.
Your motion is denied.

448
00:34:44,194 --> 00:34:46,094
We have not yet filed.

449
00:34:46,262 --> 00:34:50,096
We are simply indicating our
intent to file in writing--

450
00:34:50,266 --> 00:34:52,598
I said, "Request denied."

451
00:34:53,203 --> 00:34:54,101
Your Honor...

452
00:34:54,704 --> 00:34:57,696
...how can you summarily
deny this request?

453
00:34:58,108 --> 00:35:02,772
It is quite clear that Carl Lee Hailey
cannot receive a fair trial in Canton.

454
00:35:02,946 --> 00:35:04,208
Sidebar.

455
00:35:04,381 --> 00:35:05,780
We have a right--

456
00:35:09,386 --> 00:35:12,549
I will not tolerate
grandstanding in my courtroom.

457
00:35:20,463 --> 00:35:21,555
Get to work.

458
00:35:23,299 --> 00:35:25,563
Excellent technique, counselor.

459
00:35:38,314 --> 00:35:39,303
Your Honor.

460
00:35:39,482 --> 00:35:43,145
It would be remiss not to tell
you that in State vs. Johnson...

461
00:35:43,319 --> 00:35:44,911
...and State vs. Fisher...

462
00:35:45,088 --> 00:35:46,919
...both in 1985...

463
00:35:47,257 --> 00:35:49,817
..."Failure to consider
a change of venue...

464
00:35:49,993 --> 00:35:53,326
...has been a reversible
decision on appeal."

465
00:35:55,598 --> 00:35:57,429
No trial judge...

466
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,659
...likes his rulings overturned.

467
00:36:00,103 --> 00:36:03,095
I guess you get to submit
that brief after all.

468
00:36:03,273 --> 00:36:05,605
Have it on my desk Tuesday.

469
00:36:06,009 --> 00:36:07,840
Mr. Hailey...

470
00:36:08,011 --> 00:36:09,842
...you are hereby ordered...

471
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:14,116
...to remain in custody of the
Madison County Sheriff until trial.

472
00:36:14,451 --> 00:36:15,611
Dismissed.

473
00:36:25,028 --> 00:36:29,624
Find me that state doctor, Rodeheaver.
Get him down here to interview Hailey.

474
00:36:29,799 --> 00:36:34,702
I want to find who Brigance is using
for a shrink. I want him discredited.

475
00:36:34,971 --> 00:36:36,962
Professional or personal dirt?

476
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:39,802
Just get me enough to
shatter him in court.

477
00:36:39,976 --> 00:36:41,204
We can do that.

478
00:36:47,217 --> 00:36:51,153
This is $900, Carl Lee.
We said a thousand down.

479
00:36:51,321 --> 00:36:53,050
My kids got to eat.

480
00:36:54,157 --> 00:36:55,055
Mine too.

481
00:36:58,495 --> 00:37:00,395
When do I get the rest?

482
00:37:00,730 --> 00:37:04,063
Them folks at the bank, they
won't lend me money on my house.

483
00:37:04,234 --> 00:37:08,671
Why? The house is almost paid for.
You borrowed on it before Lester's trial.

484
00:37:08,838 --> 00:37:13,241
Say I wasn't in jail then. Say to Gwen,
how will I pay if I'm on death row?

485
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:15,910
And I lost my job at the mill.

486
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:17,341
They called Gwen.

487
00:37:17,514 --> 00:37:21,348
Worked 20 years, I'm out
5 days and they fired me.

488
00:37:23,753 --> 00:37:25,015
Carl Lee...

489
00:37:25,188 --> 00:37:28,419
...l can't try a capital
murder case for $900.

490
00:37:29,125 --> 00:37:30,353
I need to live.

491
00:37:30,527 --> 00:37:31,926
Me too, Jake.

492
00:37:32,262 --> 00:37:34,025
I need to live too.

493
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:44,636
Nice night.

494
00:37:51,147 --> 00:37:54,844
Finder of precedents, mystery
woman of the courthouse....

495
00:37:55,485 --> 00:37:56,850
Care for a beer?

496
00:38:00,256 --> 00:38:03,350
I assume that's the infamous
change of venue motion.

497
00:38:05,261 --> 00:38:07,092
Ellen Roark. R-O-A-R-K.

498
00:38:07,263 --> 00:38:10,494
That's Roark in Boston, but it
seems to be Row-ark in Mississippi.

499
00:38:10,667 --> 00:38:11,759
Boston.

500
00:38:11,935 --> 00:38:15,598
I was born there. My father's
the notorious Sheldon Roark.

501
00:38:15,772 --> 00:38:17,433
Attorney to the stars, yes.

502
00:38:17,607 --> 00:38:19,097
Duly impressed.

503
00:38:19,275 --> 00:38:22,267
What brings you to Mississippi?
Slumming?

504
00:38:22,445 --> 00:38:24,504
No, law school at Old Miss.

505
00:38:24,681 --> 00:38:26,774
It's a family tradition.

506
00:38:26,950 --> 00:38:30,943
Mom was a sweet little sorority
girl there till Dad married her.

507
00:38:31,187 --> 00:38:34,384
I married a sweet little sorority
girl from Ol' Miss myself.

508
00:38:34,691 --> 00:38:36,886
They have an excellent selection.

509
00:38:37,026 --> 00:38:37,958
They do.

510
00:38:38,294 --> 00:38:42,697
No, really, what brings you to Canton?
They have cars to sit on on campus.

511
00:38:42,899 --> 00:38:44,298
Carl Lee Hailey.

512
00:38:46,703 --> 00:38:48,466
I'd like to help you.

513
00:38:49,038 --> 00:38:51,131
What makes you think I need help?

514
00:38:51,708 --> 00:38:55,405
You're trying one of the largest
murder cases these parts have seen...

515
00:38:55,545 --> 00:38:56,807
...and you work alone.

516
00:38:56,980 --> 00:39:00,143
You have no paralegals,
clerks, researchers...

517
00:39:00,316 --> 00:39:02,045
...nor can you afford any...

518
00:39:02,218 --> 00:39:04,914
...so if Noose doesn't
accept that motion...

519
00:39:05,054 --> 00:39:09,650
...you go to trial in less than a month.
Trust me, you need help.

520
00:39:09,926 --> 00:39:11,223
How do you know this?

521
00:39:11,427 --> 00:39:13,327
I'm an excellent researcher.

522
00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:17,559
I've played gofer for 7
capital murder cases...

523
00:39:17,734 --> 00:39:21,932
...l've witnessed 2 executions.
I have written briefs for the A.C.L.U.

524
00:39:22,071 --> 00:39:26,940
I'm top 5\/\ of my class, editor of the
law review, I'm published, I'm young.

525
00:39:27,076 --> 00:39:28,737
And when I graduate...

526
00:39:28,945 --> 00:39:32,676
...l intend to spend a glorious career
stomping out the death penalty.

527
00:39:33,182 --> 00:39:34,672
Let's see, what else?

528
00:39:34,851 --> 00:39:36,443
Genius runs in my family.

529
00:39:36,686 --> 00:39:38,278
You'll get me on the way up...

530
00:39:38,421 --> 00:39:41,754
...and I really think now
is a good time to grab me.

531
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:44,951
Anything else I should know?

532
00:39:45,261 --> 00:39:47,456
Let's see, anything else?

533
00:39:47,597 --> 00:39:49,963
My father's rich so I'll work for free.

534
00:39:52,035 --> 00:39:53,468
What do you think?

535
00:39:56,606 --> 00:39:59,473
I think I'll drop this brief
off in Noose's night slot.

536
00:40:00,043 --> 00:40:01,772
Go home, see my family.

537
00:40:01,978 --> 00:40:04,105
Thanks, but I can handle the case.

538
00:40:09,552 --> 00:40:11,884
You might look at these precedents.

539
00:40:12,055 --> 00:40:13,613
State vs. Cooper...

540
00:40:13,790 --> 00:40:16,623
...and State vs. Roundtree.
Revenge killers, both acquitted.

541
00:40:20,296 --> 00:40:21,729
You'll change your mind.

542
00:40:24,133 --> 00:40:25,122
See you.

543
00:40:32,008 --> 00:40:32,997
Get out.

544
00:40:33,142 --> 00:40:34,006
Come on.

545
00:40:36,746 --> 00:40:38,907
Come here. Come on.

546
00:41:01,604 --> 00:41:02,935
Mr. Cobb...

547
00:41:03,106 --> 00:41:06,769
...this is Stump Sisson,
Grand Dragon of Mississippi.

548
00:41:08,277 --> 00:41:09,835
You were looking for us?

549
00:41:11,614 --> 00:41:14,447
You were right to call us,
Mr. Cobb.

550
00:41:15,451 --> 00:41:17,681
They say the Klan is dead.

551
00:41:19,355 --> 00:41:22,119
Klan don't show up
for a few years and...

552
00:41:22,291 --> 00:41:24,452
...people say the Klan is dead.

553
00:41:24,794 --> 00:41:27,194
Fact is, it just looks dead.

554
00:41:27,697 --> 00:41:30,461
The Klan has always been right there...

555
00:41:31,067 --> 00:41:32,864
...under the surface...

556
00:41:34,137 --> 00:41:38,471
...just waiting for the opportunity
to deliver God's justice.

557
00:41:39,642 --> 00:41:40,973
I want help.

558
00:41:41,144 --> 00:41:43,135
I want to kill that nigger.

559
00:41:43,312 --> 00:41:44,301
Niggers got...

560
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,641
...plenty of protection nowadays.

561
00:41:47,817 --> 00:41:49,808
They got the NAACP...

562
00:41:49,986 --> 00:41:51,715
...and the A.C.L.U.

563
00:41:52,488 --> 00:41:54,888
Even the federal government.

564
00:41:55,091 --> 00:41:56,149
Hell...

565
00:41:56,726 --> 00:41:58,387
...white folks ain't got a chance.

566
00:42:00,730 --> 00:42:02,595
Except the Klan.

567
00:42:06,669 --> 00:42:08,398
I'm going to tell you what.

568
00:42:10,173 --> 00:42:13,404
You get 5 or 6 of your
friends of similar thinking...

569
00:42:13,843 --> 00:42:15,242
...and we'll initiate...

570
00:42:15,411 --> 00:42:17,743
...the Madison County Klavern.

571
00:42:19,615 --> 00:42:21,606
Even make you leader.

572
00:42:23,653 --> 00:42:25,348
Now, you tell me...

573
00:42:26,122 --> 00:42:27,749
...who's that nigger's lawyer?

574
00:42:28,691 --> 00:42:30,124
Local boy.

575
00:42:30,259 --> 00:42:33,524
His name's Brigance.
He's got a pretty good reputation.

576
00:42:35,431 --> 00:42:36,921
He got family?

577
00:42:37,133 --> 00:42:40,125
Yes, sir. He has a wife and a daughter.

578
00:42:43,639 --> 00:42:44,936
Good.

579
00:43:26,582 --> 00:43:27,913
Why's he here?

580
00:43:28,084 --> 00:43:29,813
Calm down, son.

581
00:43:29,986 --> 00:43:31,920
Calm down. Come on, now.

582
00:43:32,688 --> 00:43:34,918
He has no right after what he did.

583
00:43:36,425 --> 00:43:38,825
Don't get your mom upset now.

584
00:43:52,775 --> 00:43:53,605
Looney?

585
00:43:55,511 --> 00:43:56,603
Dwayne?

586
00:44:01,284 --> 00:44:03,275
I made Ozzie bring me.

587
00:44:08,724 --> 00:44:10,624
Shit, Dwayne, we...

588
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:13,019
We knowed each other since childhood.

589
00:44:18,301 --> 00:44:19,734
It's my fault.

590
00:44:20,803 --> 00:44:22,634
No matter what's said in court...

591
00:44:23,806 --> 00:44:28,243
...l knew what I was doing, and I sure
didn't intend to hurt you, but...

592
00:44:28,377 --> 00:44:29,969
...just them two boys.

593
00:44:35,318 --> 00:44:37,980
I know it don't mean much now, but...

594
00:44:39,555 --> 00:44:40,817
...l'm sorry.

595
00:44:48,764 --> 00:44:52,495
Some folks think a black man can't
receive a fair trial in the South.

596
00:44:52,902 --> 00:44:56,668
I'll show the men and women of the South
will look past color and see the truth.

597
00:44:56,839 --> 00:44:58,773
It sure is a nigger's world.

598
00:44:58,908 --> 00:45:00,398
Not for long.

599
00:45:02,511 --> 00:45:03,671
Boys...

600
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:06,844
...l'm very proud to invite
you to become soldiers...

601
00:45:07,016 --> 00:45:10,179
...in the war to protect our
Christian homes and families.

602
00:45:10,353 --> 00:45:12,014
To resurrect our country...

603
00:45:12,188 --> 00:45:14,782
...from the fires of racial degradation.

604
00:45:15,191 --> 00:45:16,590
And to make whites...

605
00:45:16,792 --> 00:45:20,353
...the sole masters of
our nation's destiny.

606
00:45:21,364 --> 00:45:23,298
What I'm saying, fellas...

607
00:45:24,367 --> 00:45:26,426
...it's time for the nigger to pay.

608
00:45:29,305 --> 00:45:31,034
Is your telephone broken?

609
00:45:31,207 --> 00:45:33,539
We just had the number changed.

610
00:45:33,709 --> 00:45:35,438
That's what the operator said.

611
00:45:35,611 --> 00:45:37,306
To an unlisted number.

612
00:45:37,813 --> 00:45:39,804
Sorry you had to come up here.

613
00:45:39,949 --> 00:45:42,042
I should've called you, but this case--

614
00:45:42,218 --> 00:45:45,710
This case has us all
worried sick about you all.

615
00:45:45,955 --> 00:45:47,718
This thing could get ugly.

616
00:45:47,890 --> 00:45:49,448
And dangerous.

617
00:45:49,892 --> 00:45:52,122
Jake, he shot them in cold blood.

618
00:45:53,329 --> 00:45:55,627
They raped, almost killed his daughter.

619
00:45:57,466 --> 00:45:59,127
What if that happened to Hannah?

620
00:46:03,239 --> 00:46:04,729
May we ask a few questions?

621
00:46:04,907 --> 00:46:06,397
Can we get a quote?

622
00:46:06,642 --> 00:46:09,406
Excuse me, I'm going to
go take a few questions.

623
00:46:09,645 --> 00:46:11,135
This isn't the time.

624
00:46:11,347 --> 00:46:13,645
It's really good for Carl Lee.

625
00:46:15,985 --> 00:46:17,850
Thank you for coming.

626
00:46:22,591 --> 00:46:25,355
Guess we'll have to read
about it in the papers.

627
00:47:22,918 --> 00:47:24,215
Praise Jesus!

628
00:47:39,668 --> 00:47:40,430
Reverend?

629
00:47:42,571 --> 00:47:44,232
I'm lsaiah Street.

630
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:46,931
It's an honor to meet you, Reverend.

631
00:47:47,076 --> 00:47:49,169
I saw you march with Dr. King.

632
00:47:51,180 --> 00:47:53,444
The struggle continues today...

633
00:47:54,083 --> 00:47:55,345
...here in Canton.

634
00:47:55,951 --> 00:47:59,682
Carl Lee Hailey's on trial because
he's black. No other reason.

635
00:48:00,956 --> 00:48:03,447
These people are with the NAACP.

636
00:48:05,694 --> 00:48:06,683
How do you do?

637
00:48:06,862 --> 00:48:07,954
How are you?

638
00:48:10,099 --> 00:48:14,536
The black community's concerned
that Mr. Hailey's attorney...

639
00:48:14,703 --> 00:48:17,695
...isn't sensitive to the
needs of the movement.

640
00:48:18,607 --> 00:48:19,596
The NAACP...

641
00:48:20,876 --> 00:48:24,039
...wishes to provide
him with a new lawyer.

642
00:48:26,048 --> 00:48:30,212
We need to raise funds to
support Carl Lee Hailey.

643
00:48:31,554 --> 00:48:34,614
I don't know, Reverend.
Time's awfully tight here.

644
00:48:36,492 --> 00:48:38,119
Obviously...

645
00:48:38,294 --> 00:48:40,888
...we would expect you to take...

646
00:48:41,063 --> 00:48:44,624
...a modest administration
fee for your troubles.

647
00:49:11,093 --> 00:49:12,924
Your loyalty...

648
00:49:13,128 --> 00:49:15,096
...has been forged...

649
00:49:15,264 --> 00:49:17,027
...in a baptism of fire.

650
00:49:18,701 --> 00:49:20,362
Rise, knights...

651
00:49:20,536 --> 00:49:22,367
...of the Ku Klux Klan...

652
00:49:23,706 --> 00:49:25,697
...and let your brethren...

653
00:49:25,941 --> 00:49:27,704
...never regret...

654
00:49:29,512 --> 00:49:32,276
...they believed you worthy...

655
00:49:32,715 --> 00:49:34,444
...of fellowship.

656
00:49:39,889 --> 00:49:41,880
Welcome to the Klan.

657
00:49:54,069 --> 00:49:55,969
I need to talk to Jake.

658
00:49:56,138 --> 00:49:58,402
He's not in. Who's calling?

659
00:50:02,144 --> 00:50:03,133
Mickey Mouse.

660
00:50:03,646 --> 00:50:05,580
-Who?
-Mickey Mouse.

661
00:50:06,248 --> 00:50:08,079
Get out right now.

662
00:50:08,651 --> 00:50:09,640
Who's this?

663
00:50:09,718 --> 00:50:11,413
Get your daughter out of the
house right now!

664
00:50:17,159 --> 00:50:18,922
Hannah, what is it?

665
00:50:19,161 --> 00:50:20,594
Oh, my God!

666
00:50:21,830 --> 00:50:23,263
Max, come on!

667
00:50:23,432 --> 00:50:25,093
Fire!

668
00:50:25,267 --> 00:50:26,757
Fire!

669
00:50:32,775 --> 00:50:36,176
It's a good thing Hastings
was nearby and got here fast.

670
00:50:36,345 --> 00:50:38,336
The whole place could've burned.

671
00:50:39,014 --> 00:50:40,276
I appreciate it.

672
00:50:40,449 --> 00:50:41,780
Take care.

673
00:50:49,959 --> 00:50:51,517
She asleep, baby?

674
00:50:53,362 --> 00:50:56,695
The Ku Klux Klan is burning
crosses on our lawn.

675
00:50:56,865 --> 00:50:59,959
There's been no Klan
around here for years.

676
00:51:00,135 --> 00:51:04,868
This is just some dorks with too much
time on their hands and too many beers.

677
00:51:08,477 --> 00:51:09,466
I'm sorry.

678
00:51:09,645 --> 00:51:10,805
About what?

679
00:51:12,214 --> 00:51:15,650
That you weren't home when they
almost burned our house down?

680
00:51:16,385 --> 00:51:18,717
That you missed supper and didn't call?

681
00:51:18,887 --> 00:51:22,152
That you've become more interested
in getting on the news...

682
00:51:22,324 --> 00:51:24,155
...than in your own family?

683
00:51:24,326 --> 00:51:28,057
That Hannah comes home bawling
because kids call her a nigger-lover?

684
00:51:28,230 --> 00:51:30,892
What exactly are you sorry about, Jake?

685
00:51:39,575 --> 00:51:41,338
Remember the other night?

686
00:51:43,345 --> 00:51:46,007
I told you Carl Lee came by the office?

687
00:51:46,181 --> 00:51:48,081
Remember what we talked about?

688
00:51:48,684 --> 00:51:49,673
Calling Ozzie.

689
00:51:54,023 --> 00:51:56,082
You never called him, did you?

690
00:51:57,593 --> 00:51:59,254
You never called Sheriff Walls?

691
00:52:00,262 --> 00:52:01,854
I didn't call him.

692
00:52:03,198 --> 00:52:06,929
Lord have mercy, Jake,
you had a responsibility.

693
00:52:07,102 --> 00:52:09,195
Carl Lee chose you.

694
00:52:09,371 --> 00:52:12,033
He told you what he was thinking.

695
00:52:12,708 --> 00:52:15,609
He told me what he was thinking,
but I didn't know--

696
00:52:15,778 --> 00:52:19,612
Jake Tyler Brigance, we agreed
you'd call the sheriff.

697
00:52:19,882 --> 00:52:22,214
Now look at everything that's happened.

698
00:52:22,885 --> 00:52:25,547
I am sorry to tell you this, but...

699
00:52:25,721 --> 00:52:29,885
...those 2 boys are dead and you
were in a position to prevent it!

700
00:52:32,728 --> 00:52:34,286
Are you and Daddy fighting?

701
00:52:35,798 --> 00:52:37,060
Come here.

702
00:52:37,232 --> 00:52:38,961
Come here, come here.

703
00:52:40,402 --> 00:52:44,133
Mommy's just upset because some
silly man played a bad joke.

704
00:52:44,306 --> 00:52:45,796
It's nothing.

705
00:52:46,575 --> 00:52:48,736
Nothing at all, okay?

706
00:52:55,317 --> 00:52:57,308
What did the Memphis doctor say?

707
00:52:58,420 --> 00:53:00,251
She's doing good.

708
00:53:01,323 --> 00:53:02,756
Her jaw is healing.

709
00:53:02,925 --> 00:53:04,916
She can't run and jump yet, but...

710
00:53:05,094 --> 00:53:06,652
...it won't be long.

711
00:53:07,830 --> 00:53:09,593
How about the other?

712
00:53:17,506 --> 00:53:19,269
There was too much damage.

713
00:53:21,443 --> 00:53:23,502
She ain't gonna never have kids.

714
00:53:31,687 --> 00:53:34,349
You know, I think about them two boys.

715
00:53:34,523 --> 00:53:36,115
Dead, buried...

716
00:53:36,291 --> 00:53:38,191
...probably starting to rot...

717
00:53:39,128 --> 00:53:42,029
...and I remember them
walking in court...

718
00:53:42,197 --> 00:53:44,188
...one proud, the other scared.

719
00:53:45,701 --> 00:53:47,862
I remember how they fell.

720
00:53:48,036 --> 00:53:52,973
One on top of the other, screaming
and squirming and not going nowhere.

721
00:53:54,977 --> 00:53:57,036
God help me, Gwen, but...

722
00:53:59,214 --> 00:54:01,705
...that's the only
thought gives me comfort.

723
00:54:04,987 --> 00:54:08,150
They took up a collection
for us at church.

724
00:54:08,724 --> 00:54:11,215
Some kind of defense fund.

725
00:54:11,894 --> 00:54:14,556
Reverend Agee gave a good service.

726
00:54:17,733 --> 00:54:20,896
We need some money 'round
the house, Carl Lee...

727
00:54:21,069 --> 00:54:23,731
...for groceries and bills.

728
00:54:24,239 --> 00:54:25,672
How much you got?

729
00:54:27,242 --> 00:54:28,504
Less than 50.

730
00:54:30,345 --> 00:54:32,006
I'll think of something.

731
00:54:35,350 --> 00:54:39,411
How you think you going to get
money when you stuck in jail?

732
00:54:39,588 --> 00:54:41,351
Trust me, Gwen.

733
00:54:46,261 --> 00:54:48,252
I just get scared.

734
00:54:50,098 --> 00:54:51,360
Look here...

735
00:54:52,601 --> 00:54:55,263
...tell me exactly what
Reverend Agee said...

736
00:54:55,437 --> 00:54:58,031
...when he passed around
the collection plate.

737
00:54:58,207 --> 00:55:01,370
I don't care. We're dealing
with life and death here.

738
00:55:01,543 --> 00:55:04,376
-I must talk to my supervisor.
-Go talk to him.

739
00:55:04,546 --> 00:55:05,535
Get out!

740
00:55:05,714 --> 00:55:07,875
How are things at the electric company?

741
00:55:08,050 --> 00:55:11,952
That is the second time this
week I've had to hold him off.

742
00:55:12,621 --> 00:55:13,553
How much we owe?

743
00:55:13,722 --> 00:55:15,053
$2,000.

744
00:55:15,224 --> 00:55:17,624
-How much do we have?
-$100.

745
00:55:17,793 --> 00:55:21,058
Look, this week nothing
has come in at all.

746
00:55:21,230 --> 00:55:24,063
What about Buck Britt's retainer?
There's 2 grand.

747
00:55:24,233 --> 00:55:25,564
That check bounced.

748
00:55:25,734 --> 00:55:27,133
What do you mean?

749
00:55:27,569 --> 00:55:29,298
It bounced, Jake.

750
00:55:29,471 --> 00:55:31,735
It sat on your desk all week.

751
00:55:32,241 --> 00:55:33,970
Not that you'd notice.

752
00:55:35,978 --> 00:55:39,470
Since you took this case, you
stopped talking to your clients...

753
00:55:39,648 --> 00:55:41,479
...you don't take your calls...

754
00:55:41,650 --> 00:55:43,914
...you're obsessed! You are!

755
00:55:43,986 --> 00:55:45,146
You're obsessed!

756
00:55:45,921 --> 00:55:48,651
Your obsession is going to break us!

757
00:55:49,258 --> 00:55:51,920
What's wrong? We've
been through hard times.

758
00:55:52,094 --> 00:55:53,994
No, not like this, Jake.

759
00:55:54,162 --> 00:55:55,823
Not like this.

760
00:55:57,099 --> 00:55:58,999
We've been getting calls.

761
00:55:59,334 --> 00:56:00,494
At home.

762
00:56:00,669 --> 00:56:01,931
Threats.

763
00:56:03,171 --> 00:56:07,608
You know Bud has survived two strokes.
I don't think he'd survive a third.

764
00:56:07,776 --> 00:56:08,936
Why didn't you tell me?

765
00:56:10,279 --> 00:56:11,940
Why, Jake?

766
00:56:12,180 --> 00:56:13,841
Would you drop the case?

767
00:56:19,621 --> 00:56:20,952
Jake Brigance's office.

768
00:56:21,123 --> 00:56:23,023
Until they cut the phones off.

769
00:56:24,359 --> 00:56:25,792
Oh, right.

770
00:56:29,131 --> 00:56:33,033
That was Sheriff Walls.
You better get down to the jail.

771
00:56:40,375 --> 00:56:42,036
What's going on here?

772
00:56:42,711 --> 00:56:43,939
I'm lsaiah Street.

773
00:56:44,112 --> 00:56:45,545
Jake Brigance.

774
00:56:47,382 --> 00:56:49,543
I believe you know Reverend Agee.

775
00:56:49,718 --> 00:56:51,049
And this is...

776
00:56:51,219 --> 00:56:53,949
Norman Reinfeld, I've seen
your picture in the paper.

777
00:56:54,957 --> 00:56:56,788
I assume these boys carry your things.

778
00:56:57,893 --> 00:57:00,623
Just a small part of
my legal defense team.

779
00:57:00,796 --> 00:57:02,127
Pleasure, Mr. Brigance.

780
00:57:03,565 --> 00:57:05,965
If it's a party, where's the beer?

781
00:57:06,401 --> 00:57:07,231
Otherwise...

782
00:57:07,402 --> 00:57:10,394
...your being here seems a bit like
illegal client solicitation...

783
00:57:10,739 --> 00:57:13,071
...with Carl Lee
already having a lawyer.

784
00:57:13,241 --> 00:57:14,469
Just a minute.

785
00:57:14,977 --> 00:57:17,070
Carl Lee invited us here.

786
00:57:19,247 --> 00:57:20,908
Mr. Brigance...

787
00:57:21,817 --> 00:57:23,580
...let me be frank.

788
00:57:23,752 --> 00:57:27,153
Mr. Hailey's case has
far-reaching ramifications.

789
00:57:27,589 --> 00:57:30,149
Carl Lee's acquittal for
killing 2 white men...

790
00:57:30,325 --> 00:57:32,418
...would do more for
black people than...

791
00:57:32,594 --> 00:57:35,995
...any event since we
integrated the schools.

792
00:57:36,164 --> 00:57:39,327
His conviction, on the other
hand, will be a slap at us.

793
00:57:39,501 --> 00:57:41,662
A symbol of deep-seated racism.

794
00:57:41,803 --> 00:57:44,101
Perhaps enough to ignite a nation.

795
00:57:44,272 --> 00:57:46,672
See how important this case is?

796
00:57:46,842 --> 00:57:49,333
Enter Mr. Reinfeld's death squad, right?

797
00:57:49,511 --> 00:57:53,345
It's an unfortunate
nickname, but apropo.

798
00:57:53,515 --> 00:57:57,007
My lawyers and I handle
only capital murder cases.

799
00:57:57,185 --> 00:57:58,447
Of all your cases...

800
00:57:58,620 --> 00:58:02,522
...how many are supposed to be
lost so you can martyr the victim?

801
00:58:03,125 --> 00:58:05,958
How much a defense like that cost?

802
00:58:11,700 --> 00:58:13,361
What, about $100,000?

803
00:58:13,535 --> 00:58:17,631
We are prepared to accept $7,000
in litigation expenses.

804
00:58:18,540 --> 00:58:21,202
Carl Lee doesn't have $7,000.

805
00:58:21,710 --> 00:58:22,699
Do you?

806
00:58:23,211 --> 00:58:24,200
The NAACP...

807
00:58:24,379 --> 00:58:28,873
...has raised $5,000 for Carl
Lee's legal defense fund.

808
00:58:29,051 --> 00:58:32,214
And we raised an additional
$2,000 from local churches.

809
00:58:32,387 --> 00:58:34,048
Let me ask you something.

810
00:58:34,389 --> 00:58:37,381
How much of that cash you
offer my wife and kids?

811
00:58:37,559 --> 00:58:38,890
That money...

812
00:58:39,061 --> 00:58:41,655
...is to go to pay for lawyers' fees.

813
00:58:41,830 --> 00:58:43,991
That ain't what you told the church.

814
00:58:44,666 --> 00:58:47,066
You almost cried when you told them...

815
00:58:47,235 --> 00:58:51,001
...how my family might starve
if they didn't donate.

816
00:58:51,506 --> 00:58:54,498
The money is for you
and your family, but...

817
00:58:54,676 --> 00:58:57,577
...we thought it'd be better
spent on the legal defense.

818
00:58:57,746 --> 00:59:00,078
Speaking of that defense fund...

819
00:59:00,348 --> 00:59:03,181
...can I use that for any lawyer I want?

820
00:59:04,086 --> 00:59:06,179
It's not that simple, Carl Lee.

821
00:59:06,354 --> 00:59:09,084
Actually, it is that simple, Carl Lee.

822
00:59:09,257 --> 00:59:10,747
Unless the NAACP...

823
00:59:10,926 --> 00:59:14,020
...wants to go on record as soliciting
funds under false pretenses.

824
00:59:14,196 --> 00:59:15,356
Listen...

825
00:59:15,530 --> 00:59:17,361
...we raised that money...

826
00:59:17,532 --> 00:59:21,263
...for these men to get you out of
here, not for this cracker to--

827
00:59:21,436 --> 00:59:24,371
Now, hold on. Hold on right there, now.

828
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:28,100
Let me just get this
straight here, Reverend.

829
00:59:31,213 --> 00:59:33,044
If you don't give my wife...

830
00:59:33,215 --> 00:59:34,773
...that cash...

831
00:59:34,950 --> 00:59:38,716
...l'll see to it everybody in this
town knows you're a lying crook.

832
00:59:39,221 --> 00:59:41,781
Your congregation will
be interested to know...

833
00:59:41,957 --> 00:59:45,290
...Gwen and the kids can't eat
because you want in with the NAACP.

834
00:59:45,460 --> 00:59:47,121
That's right.

835
00:59:47,295 --> 00:59:48,785
When I'm through with you...

836
00:59:48,964 --> 00:59:52,730
...you won't be able to collect
2 cents in the collection plate.

837
00:59:52,901 --> 00:59:56,132
We'll expect the check for
the Hailey family today.

838
00:59:59,074 --> 01:00:01,565
I sure do appreciate your fine work...

839
01:00:01,743 --> 01:00:03,802
...but I'll take my chances with Jake.

840
01:00:05,914 --> 01:00:08,246
Thanks for coming down.

841
01:00:09,084 --> 01:00:11,143
We'll expect that check...

842
01:00:11,319 --> 01:00:14,755
...for Jake's legal services
around the same time today.

843
01:00:18,827 --> 01:00:20,089
Good day, men.

844
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:40,841
You set that whole thing up.

845
01:00:41,016 --> 01:00:42,847
Couldn't have done it alone.

846
01:00:45,287 --> 01:00:47,278
Make one hell of a team.

847
01:00:47,956 --> 01:00:49,514
You out there.

848
01:00:49,691 --> 01:00:51,022
I'm in here.

849
01:00:51,193 --> 01:00:52,683
We ain't no team.

850
01:01:17,319 --> 01:01:18,980
There's trouble.

851
01:01:20,488 --> 01:01:21,386
Look there.

852
01:01:27,562 --> 01:01:29,393
No, here's trouble.

853
01:01:39,007 --> 01:01:39,905
You are?

854
01:01:40,175 --> 01:01:41,836
Meet Harry Rex Vonner...

855
01:01:42,010 --> 01:01:45,571
...the most effective, morally-
compromised lawyer in the country.

856
01:01:45,747 --> 01:01:47,738
Ellen Roark, brilliant law student.

857
01:01:47,916 --> 01:01:49,008
Do what you will.

858
01:01:49,184 --> 01:01:50,173
Looking forward to it.

859
01:01:52,587 --> 01:01:54,418
This might interest you.

860
01:01:54,589 --> 01:01:59,083
In assessing murder trials, the
insanity plea only makes up 1\/\ overall.

861
01:01:59,261 --> 01:02:04,096
And of the 1\/\ that resulted in acquittal
success rested almost wholly on the--

862
01:02:04,266 --> 01:02:08,862
Defending psychiatrist regardless of the
quality of the psychological testimony.

863
01:02:09,537 --> 01:02:11,437
Shazam. She is brilliant.

864
01:02:11,606 --> 01:02:13,767
"She." That would be me?

865
01:02:13,942 --> 01:02:14,874
Who else?

866
01:02:15,043 --> 01:02:16,101
She would be me.

867
01:02:16,278 --> 01:02:19,042
She is saying that if I
take this plea to trial...

868
01:02:19,214 --> 01:02:22,945
...the verdict will hinge on the
shrink the jury finds more credible.

869
01:02:23,285 --> 01:02:24,877
She will be correct.

870
01:02:25,287 --> 01:02:26,879
She would.

871
01:02:27,555 --> 01:02:29,455
Sure you don't need help?

872
01:02:29,791 --> 01:02:30,621
I do.

873
01:02:30,792 --> 01:02:33,124
I'm hiring. Right now. Me.

874
01:02:33,561 --> 01:02:37,725
Roark, I am sure that I don't need
any help. Thank you, though.

875
01:02:39,968 --> 01:02:43,233
I guess that would just
have to be your loss, then.

876
01:02:44,906 --> 01:02:46,737
Nice to meet you, Morally-Compromised.

877
01:02:47,475 --> 01:02:48,737
Pleasure's all mine...

878
01:02:48,910 --> 01:02:49,968
..."She."

879
01:02:53,815 --> 01:02:57,410
You've got to love the Lord
for making things like that.

880
01:02:57,585 --> 01:03:01,749
Sure you don't want to look at
her rsum? You could use help.

881
01:03:02,657 --> 01:03:06,423
No, I don't want to look at
her rsum, because I have you.

882
01:03:06,928 --> 01:03:07,587
You do?

883
01:03:07,929 --> 01:03:09,089
Yeah, buddy.

884
01:03:09,264 --> 01:03:14,099
This is your chance to put aside your
shady sources and greedy divorcees...

885
01:03:14,269 --> 01:03:16,328
...and do some real law for once.

886
01:03:18,006 --> 01:03:19,837
Mr. Vonner, in short...

887
01:03:20,008 --> 01:03:23,171
...you have the opportunity to
work on a case that matters.

888
01:03:24,446 --> 01:03:25,936
Let me get this straight.

889
01:03:26,114 --> 01:03:30,175
You want me to put aside my
empty, soulless, shady...

890
01:03:30,352 --> 01:03:33,515
...astonishingly lucrative,
divorcee practice...

891
01:03:33,688 --> 01:03:37,784
...come work with you on an unwinnable,
lose-all-my-friends case...

892
01:03:38,860 --> 01:03:40,054
...because it matters?

893
01:03:40,128 --> 01:03:41,857
It's a novel idea, I know.

894
01:03:42,030 --> 01:03:45,022
No way. Never.
Presumptuous little shit.

895
01:03:46,968 --> 01:03:48,128
Goodnight, y'all.

896
01:03:54,142 --> 01:03:55,700
I need the sheriff.

897
01:03:55,877 --> 01:03:57,139
He's asleep.

898
01:03:57,312 --> 01:03:58,870
Well, get him up.

899
01:03:59,047 --> 01:04:00,378
Who is this?

900
01:04:00,548 --> 01:04:02,641
Someone's going to die tonight.

901
01:04:26,408 --> 01:04:27,739
I got him!

902
01:04:28,510 --> 01:04:29,738
Get his ass!

903
01:04:29,911 --> 01:04:31,503
What's in the case?

904
01:04:41,022 --> 01:04:42,080
It's ticking.

905
01:04:42,257 --> 01:04:43,417
What is it?

906
01:04:43,591 --> 01:04:45,183
I ain't saying.

907
01:04:49,864 --> 01:04:50,762
Family out?

908
01:04:53,768 --> 01:04:55,099
It's locked.

909
01:05:00,041 --> 01:05:01,269
Open it.

910
01:05:12,387 --> 01:05:13,445
My God!

911
01:05:13,955 --> 01:05:15,217
Oh, man....

912
01:05:17,559 --> 01:05:18,548
Defuse it.

913
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:21,224
I'm going to take you and this...

914
01:05:21,296 --> 01:05:23,059
...nigger-lover to hell with--

915
01:05:24,732 --> 01:05:27,462
Ain't nothing more dangerous
than a fool with a cause.

916
01:05:27,635 --> 01:05:31,071
Lay that thing back down there
real easy-like. Let's go.

917
01:05:31,239 --> 01:05:33,139
Carla loves this house.

918
01:05:56,164 --> 01:05:57,256
Come here.

919
01:06:01,102 --> 01:06:03,662
Are you coming to Grandpa's too?

920
01:06:04,005 --> 01:06:06,439
Daddy must stay here and work.

921
01:06:06,774 --> 01:06:09,334
You and your mom have a good time.

922
01:06:09,511 --> 01:06:10,944
You be good.

923
01:06:11,513 --> 01:06:13,003
Go get your stuff.

924
01:06:14,182 --> 01:06:16,616
You said you'd quit if it got dangerous.

925
01:06:16,784 --> 01:06:17,842
I know.

926
01:06:18,019 --> 01:06:20,112
I can't quit now, you know that.

927
01:06:21,022 --> 01:06:24,685
Carl Lee is facing the gas chamber.
The man is counting on me.

928
01:06:25,627 --> 01:06:27,857
I understand that, Jake.

929
01:06:28,196 --> 01:06:30,687
Remember that we're counting on you too.

930
01:06:30,865 --> 01:06:32,628
What if something happens to you?

931
01:06:33,301 --> 01:06:35,462
Nothing's going to happen. Come here.

932
01:06:36,638 --> 01:06:37,366
Hug?

933
01:06:38,873 --> 01:06:41,637
Everything will be okay.
I'll be fine, you'll be fine.

934
01:06:43,545 --> 01:06:44,807
Okay, babe?

935
01:06:46,481 --> 01:06:47,539
I promise.

936
01:06:49,817 --> 01:06:52,047
Don't make promises you can't keep.

937
01:06:56,991 --> 01:06:58,151
You ready?

938
01:07:11,239 --> 01:07:13,730
Good afternoon. Come in.

939
01:07:15,310 --> 01:07:16,504
Good afternoon.

940
01:07:16,644 --> 01:07:19,408
You may come this way.
The judge is upstairs.

941
01:07:19,581 --> 01:07:20,809
Thank you, sir.

942
01:07:29,657 --> 01:07:30,817
Judge Noose.

943
01:07:32,527 --> 01:07:33,926
Thanks for coming.

944
01:07:35,830 --> 01:07:38,321
Heard you had trouble last night.

945
01:07:38,766 --> 01:07:41,929
Makes you wonder about the
sensibleness of taking this case.

946
01:07:42,270 --> 01:07:44,761
This is a beautiful place you have here.

947
01:07:45,340 --> 01:07:47,035
I'll get to the point.

948
01:07:47,175 --> 01:07:51,043
I've thoroughly reviewed
your brief request and...

949
01:07:51,179 --> 01:07:53,044
...a change of venue.

950
01:07:53,681 --> 01:07:58,175
And I agree with you. It's impossible
to find an impartial jury in Canton.

951
01:07:58,353 --> 01:08:03,120
I think it's impossible to find an
impartial jury anywhere in Mississippi.

952
01:08:03,458 --> 01:08:04,857
As such...

953
01:08:05,126 --> 01:08:07,458
...a jury here would be...

954
01:08:07,629 --> 01:08:10,291
...as fair as a jury anywhere else.

955
01:08:10,632 --> 01:08:13,624
So I decided to deny your
request for a change of venue.

956
01:08:16,804 --> 01:08:18,294
I guess that...

957
01:08:18,573 --> 01:08:20,200
...gives me something to appeal.

958
01:08:20,375 --> 01:08:22,070
Actually, no.

959
01:08:23,077 --> 01:08:25,204
I spoke to Judge Dent...

960
01:08:25,647 --> 01:08:29,879
...and he believes that the Supreme
Court would uphold my ruling.

961
01:08:31,085 --> 01:08:33,315
You certainly covered your bases.

962
01:08:36,891 --> 01:08:38,984
You're a good lawyer.

963
01:08:39,494 --> 01:08:41,894
You're bright and ambitious.
Talented.

964
01:08:42,096 --> 01:08:43,222
You could be someone.

965
01:08:43,398 --> 01:08:47,391
You sure you want to be known as
the man that defended that murderer?

966
01:08:47,902 --> 01:08:50,097
Could be very unpopular.

967
01:08:51,172 --> 01:08:52,833
Talk to your client.

968
01:08:53,608 --> 01:08:55,098
He pleads guilty...

969
01:08:55,243 --> 01:08:59,179
...Buckley'll accept manslaughter.
He'll be out in 20.

970
01:08:59,914 --> 01:09:02,906
And how's his wife supposed
to raise his family alone?

971
01:09:03,751 --> 01:09:05,412
Better than being a widow.

972
01:09:07,021 --> 01:09:08,511
Think about it.

973
01:09:09,257 --> 01:09:11,919
Why toss away a promising career?

974
01:09:15,930 --> 01:09:16,862
Good day.

975
01:09:17,198 --> 01:09:18,529
Thanks for coming.

976
01:09:24,205 --> 01:09:26,196
Where the hell is this guy?

977
01:09:26,874 --> 01:09:28,535
Born alcoholic.

978
01:09:28,710 --> 01:09:31,372
But the man cannot hold his liquor.

979
01:09:33,214 --> 01:09:37,275
Allow me to present
Dr. Willard Tyrrel Bass.

980
01:09:37,719 --> 01:09:40,210
Expert witness for the defense.

981
01:09:41,723 --> 01:09:43,657
This is Jake Brigance...

982
01:09:43,791 --> 01:09:45,053
...my protg.

983
01:09:55,570 --> 01:09:57,060
Are you kidding me?

984
01:09:57,238 --> 01:09:58,569
Relax.

985
01:09:58,740 --> 01:10:01,072
When he's sober, he's terrific.

986
01:10:01,976 --> 01:10:03,238
He has his license.

987
01:10:03,678 --> 01:10:05,908
His credentials are impeccable.

988
01:10:10,251 --> 01:10:12,481
Well, I need a drink.

989
01:10:12,754 --> 01:10:14,585
3 in the afternoon?

990
01:10:14,756 --> 01:10:17,486
My, oh, my, what would your wife say?

991
01:10:17,692 --> 01:10:19,990
I am my own man. I drink when I want.

992
01:10:20,194 --> 01:10:22,822
-When did she leave town?
-This morning.

993
01:10:42,917 --> 01:10:43,474
God!

994
01:10:59,133 --> 01:11:00,225
That's enough!

995
01:11:06,307 --> 01:11:08,366
Now you tell your boss...

996
01:11:08,543 --> 01:11:11,034
...next time people are going to die.

997
01:11:45,279 --> 01:11:46,405
Morning.

998
01:11:50,084 --> 01:11:52,075
Nice parking job. Late night?

999
01:12:01,796 --> 01:12:03,423
So, here.

1000
01:12:05,032 --> 01:12:05,930
Thank you.

1001
01:12:06,100 --> 01:12:07,931
Your wife lets you sleep here?

1002
01:12:08,369 --> 01:12:10,098
My wife left town.

1003
01:12:10,538 --> 01:12:11,869
That's too bad.

1004
01:12:12,807 --> 01:12:14,604
Listen, I heard that...

1005
01:12:14,809 --> 01:12:16,800
...Noose turned down your motion.

1006
01:12:20,114 --> 01:12:22,708
It's time I take you to breakfast.

1007
01:12:25,720 --> 01:12:26,880
Lunch.

1008
01:12:28,890 --> 01:12:30,551
Quit playing with that food.

1009
01:12:30,625 --> 01:12:33,958
Y'all come back. You need to
finish that before Christmas.

1010
01:12:34,395 --> 01:12:35,453
Thank you.

1011
01:12:35,630 --> 01:12:36,619
Now....

1012
01:12:36,831 --> 01:12:39,459
You are opposed to the death penalty.

1013
01:12:39,634 --> 01:12:40,965
Why?

1014
01:12:41,135 --> 01:12:41,965
You're not?

1015
01:12:42,970 --> 01:12:44,835
I'm in favor of it.

1016
01:12:44,972 --> 01:12:47,907
I'd like to go back to
hangings if we could.

1017
01:12:48,643 --> 01:12:49,575
You're kidding.

1018
01:12:50,077 --> 01:12:54,741
No. The only problem with the death
penalty is that we do not use it enough.

1019
01:12:57,985 --> 01:13:00,476
Have you told Carl Lee this?

1020
01:13:00,855 --> 01:13:04,848
The men who raped his daughter deserved
the death penalty, not Carl Lee.

1021
01:13:04,992 --> 01:13:07,483
How do you decide who
dies and who doesn't?

1022
01:13:07,662 --> 01:13:12,156
Simple. You take the crime
and you take the criminal.

1023
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:14,090
Now, say...

1024
01:13:14,268 --> 01:13:16,998
...a crack dealer guns
down an undercover cop.

1025
01:13:17,171 --> 01:13:19,264
You strap him to a chair and turn it on.

1026
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:22,170
For some reason, I thought
you were a liberal.

1027
01:13:22,677 --> 01:13:24,440
I am a liberal.

1028
01:13:24,612 --> 01:13:28,514
What I am not is a
card-carrying A.C.L.U. radical.

1029
01:13:28,950 --> 01:13:31,441
I don't believe in rehabilitation.

1030
01:13:31,752 --> 01:13:33,185
I believe in safety.

1031
01:13:33,387 --> 01:13:35,014
I believe in justice.

1032
01:13:36,891 --> 01:13:39,689
I see. Well, let me ask you something.

1033
01:13:40,294 --> 01:13:42,125
Ever seen an execution?

1034
01:13:43,531 --> 01:13:44,691
Not that I recall.

1035
01:13:44,899 --> 01:13:47,459
I suggest you go watch
a man be executed.

1036
01:13:47,635 --> 01:13:52,038
You watch him die, watch him beg, watch
him kick and spit the life out of him...

1037
01:13:52,106 --> 01:13:54,404
...until he shits and is gone.

1038
01:13:54,542 --> 01:13:57,477
Then come back and sing
this crap about justice....

1039
01:13:57,812 --> 01:14:01,213
Spare me your Northern
liberal cry-me-a-river...

1040
01:14:01,415 --> 01:14:04,407
...we-are-the-only-enlightened-ones
bullshit.

1041
01:14:04,552 --> 01:14:07,316
I'm sorry, yes, you are the enlightened.

1042
01:14:07,488 --> 01:14:11,424
That's why you brought me to this
diner in this black neighborhood.

1043
01:14:11,559 --> 01:14:15,552
So you can convince me you're
this JFK-meets-Christ white boy.

1044
01:14:15,730 --> 01:14:16,924
Is that it?

1045
01:14:17,064 --> 01:14:19,931
Or is it because you're a repressed,
hypocritical provincial...

1046
01:14:20,067 --> 01:14:23,559
...who didn't want to be seen
around town with a woman like me.

1047
01:14:24,071 --> 01:14:26,232
Yes, siree, you sure are enlightened.

1048
01:14:26,440 --> 01:14:30,672
I'm terribly sorry, I've made a mistake.
I thought you were one of the good guys.

1049
01:14:30,745 --> 01:14:32,940
Thank you for your time.

1050
01:14:50,097 --> 01:14:51,962
I'm a little worked up.

1051
01:14:53,601 --> 01:14:56,468
That's not the best
way to apply for a job.

1052
01:14:59,273 --> 01:15:03,767
I don't want the jury to see pictures of
the dead rapists. Can we keep them out?

1053
01:15:06,047 --> 01:15:08,607
It's vital the jury know
the details of the rape.

1054
01:15:09,216 --> 01:15:11,207
I'll need briefs on both.

1055
01:15:11,852 --> 01:15:14,719
I don't like your politics,
but you do have passion...

1056
01:15:14,889 --> 01:15:18,791
...and that's something Carl
Lee needs, and maybe so do l.

1057
01:15:21,228 --> 01:15:22,388
You getting this?

1058
01:15:22,563 --> 01:15:24,292
I'm writing it down.

1059
01:15:25,232 --> 01:15:27,996
Here's what we got. It's official.

1060
01:15:28,402 --> 01:15:30,893
Hailey's trial will be held in Canton.

1061
01:15:31,072 --> 01:15:35,634
Today, presiding Judge Noose issued
150 summons for potential jurors...

1062
01:15:35,810 --> 01:15:37,243
...in a sealed envelope.

1063
01:15:39,413 --> 01:15:41,313
To prevent tampering...

1064
01:15:41,582 --> 01:15:45,643
...that list will be kept
confidential until selection begins.

1065
01:15:45,820 --> 01:15:48,914
No one, not even
Mr. Brigance or myself...

1066
01:15:49,090 --> 01:15:52,059
...will know the identities
of the potential jurors.
