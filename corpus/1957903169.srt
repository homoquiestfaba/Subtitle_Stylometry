1
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:41,870
Tanny is a myth.

2
00:02:42,043 --> 00:02:45,536
She dated the greatest
choreographer of all time.

3
00:02:45,672 --> 00:02:50,588
She was at the peak of her ability.
she was beautiful  She was a muse.

4
00:03:16,077 --> 00:03:19,786
And on the pinnacle of
success she fell down.

5
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:31,797
Tanny had a very unique sense of music.

6
00:03:31,967 --> 00:03:34,801
That's what made her dancing so interesting.

7
00:03:34,971 --> 00:03:36,678
I think that's what she was born with.

8
00:03:42,644 --> 00:03:47,810
She was tall, slim and rather bony.

9
00:03:47,983 --> 00:03:51,601
That's why she moved very
differently from the others.

10
00:04:02,247 --> 00:04:04,079
She covered the whole room.

11
00:04:04,249 --> 00:04:08,710
She wasn't ashamed to make her legs longer

12
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,290
than they already were when she danced.

13
00:04:28,314 --> 00:04:30,681
Dancers were usually small and nimble.

14
00:04:31,108 --> 00:04:32,974
Stocky and fast.

15
00:04:33,987 --> 00:04:40,574
And then she comes, long,
graceful, like a path to heaven.

16
00:05:18,614 --> 00:05:23,109
Tanny's body was an
inspiration for the choreographers.

17
00:05:23,286 --> 00:05:26,245
They could create things
they had never seen before!

18
00:05:48,269 --> 00:05:50,682
There's this famous story.

19
00:05:50,854 --> 00:05:54,268
She was a teenager and at
the <i>School Of American Ballet.</i>

20
00:05:54,441 --> 00:05:57,149
Balanchine was the director of the ballet

21
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,652
school, but he did not teach all classes.

22
00:06:00,281 --> 00:06:02,398
He was walking down the hall while

23
00:06:02,575 --> 00:06:05,487
all the other students were in class,

24
00:06:05,661 --> 00:06:09,780
and suddenly there was a young, pretty girl

25
00:06:09,956 --> 00:06:14,371
with long legs standing
in front of a classroom.

26
00:06:14,545 --> 00:06:18,333
She had crossed her arms resolutely.

27
00:06:18,799 --> 00:06:24,964
He spoke to her: "Why aren't you in class?"

28
00:06:25,638 --> 00:06:28,630
And she replied, "Got thrown out."

29
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:32,264
And he said, "What's your name?"
- "Tanni."

30
00:06:58,004 --> 00:07:00,791
I was a student at the
<i>School Of American Ballet.</i>

31
00:07:00,964 --> 00:07:02,422
That's where I met Tanny.

32
00:07:02,633 --> 00:07:05,626
She was already a star
and I was just a beginner.

33
00:07:05,804 --> 00:07:09,137
She was destined for a great career.

34
00:07:10,849 --> 00:07:12,307
I loved dancing.

35
00:07:12,976 --> 00:07:15,514
I was at the ballet.  I thought
that would be very nice.

36
00:07:15,688 --> 00:07:19,146
I liked it.  I also took
piano lessons, but I

37
00:07:19,316 --> 00:07:22,230
was stupid.  One could see immediately:

38
00:07:22,403 --> 00:07:25,317
The child can't play,
let's let it dance instead.

39
00:07:27,283 --> 00:07:32,699
At 14 we became very close friends.

40
00:07:32,871 --> 00:07:35,489
She led a very sheltered life.

41
00:07:35,667 --> 00:07:38,659
She liked the normality of our friendship.

42
00:07:41,171 --> 00:07:43,753
She got private lessons and had a

43
00:07:43,923 --> 00:07:46,257
Scholarship for the
<i>School Of American Ballet.</i>

44
00:07:48,095 --> 00:07:52,840
Tanny didn't socialize too

45
00:07:53,016 --> 00:07:56,225
youngsters their age.  She longed for it.

46
00:07:56,395 --> 00:07:58,808
She longed to break
out of this life in a glass

47
00:07:58,981 --> 00:08:01,301
house that her mother had built around her.

48
00:08:01,483 --> 00:08:04,476
Edith was the paragon of a ballet mother.

49
00:08:04,653 --> 00:08:07,896
She mended Tanny's pointe
shoes and knitted her tights.

50
00:08:08,072 --> 00:08:10,632
They lived in Paris for a while,
and that's where Tanny was born.

51
00:08:10,659 --> 00:08:13,276
And then they returned to America.

52
00:08:13,454 --> 00:08:16,618
I think her parents, Edith and Jacques,

53
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:17,910
broke up when they were very young.

54
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:21,792
I didn't know if they were divorced
because Jacques would show up occasionally.

55
00:08:21,961 --> 00:08:25,876
But most of the time Edith
was alone and a ballet mom.

56
00:08:26,048 --> 00:08:28,415
A ballet mother of the first order.

57
00:08:29,969 --> 00:08:33,384
When I was 15, I knew
absolutely nothing of what

58
00:08:33,556 --> 00:08:41,021
a normal girl knew at 15.
You know what I mean?

59
00:08:41,189 --> 00:08:44,399
For example, I didn't know
Frank Sinatra's latest record.

60
00:08:44,567 --> 00:08:47,401
I didn't know the popular dances either.

61
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:50,813
But I had gained valuable experience.

62
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:55,452
What an education!
While others sat at home, I

63
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:59,365
traveled to Europe.
Italy, France... Fantastic!

64
00:08:59,541 --> 00:09:03,033
I've met celebrities, been to

65
00:09:03,211 --> 00:09:05,453
world-famous theaters, tasted exotic food.

66
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:09,088
And the other girls went
to high school at home.

67
00:09:10,634 --> 00:09:13,378
At the time I was living in Bronxville.

68
00:09:13,554 --> 00:09:17,468
After Tanny got back, she
liked to visit me on the weekends.

69
00:09:17,642 --> 00:09:20,805
She loved the normal life
in my family because it was

70
00:09:20,978 --> 00:09:23,937
so different than anything
she had ever experienced.

71
00:09:24,106 --> 00:09:26,849
My parents were simple people.  We were

72
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:28,436
excellently cooked and went to the cinema.

73
00:09:28,736 --> 00:09:30,944
THE NAZIS DEATH MILLS

74
00:09:31,155 --> 00:09:34,899
I can remember exactly how
we went to the cinema again.

75
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:39,662
I clearly remember the
newsreel showing pictures of what

76
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:43,994
the Americans had found in the
Auschwitz concentration camp.

77
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:46,847
They had photographed and
filmed the people behind the bars.

78
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:50,163
We were both totally shocked.

79
00:09:50,341 --> 00:09:54,334
Tanny left the cinema hall, she ran out.

80
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:59,757
I followed her and found
her crying on the toilet.

81
00:09:59,934 --> 00:10:01,926
Your reaction touched me.

82
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:05,187
Of course, I also found these pictures

83
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:07,688
unbelievable and more than one can bear.

84
00:10:07,858 --> 00:10:11,818
But I can well remember
how strongly she sympathized.

85
00:10:19,203 --> 00:10:22,821
In New York we lived a real teenage life.

86
00:10:22,998 --> 00:10:27,583
We went to the cinema
a lot, we gossiped about

87
00:10:27,751 --> 00:10:30,243
people and we started
to get interested in boys.

88
00:10:33,842 --> 00:10:38,882
Tanny was very charismatic and I knew

89
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:43,299
a lot of men who found her fascinating.

90
00:10:47,606 --> 00:10:54,820
From 14 to 17 or 18 we were inseparable.

91
00:10:54,988 --> 00:11:00,484
I then moved to Paris and
wasn't there when she got sick.

92
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:08,914
At times I thought there

93
00:11:09,084 --> 00:11:12,418
might be another life for me too.

94
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:15,797
That I could just get on
a train and go anywhere.

95
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:19,550
I would have a job with regular
working hours from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.

96
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:23,464
Before my marriage, I dated a few men.

97
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:26,850


98
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:29,227
I'm with them on different

99
00:11:29,396 --> 00:11:30,396
went to parties and saw

100
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:34,275
other lives and that's when I felt

101
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:37,777
that I don't miss it that much.

102
00:11:43,284 --> 00:11:46,072
The <i>New York City
Ballet</i> is now ten years old.

103
00:11:46,245 --> 00:11:50,785
It's unbelievable how successful
ballet has been in recent years.

104
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:53,827
To an outsider it always
looks very complicated,

105
00:11:54,003 --> 00:11:55,869
an almost artistic form of expression.

106
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:57,048
And now it's popular.

107
00:11:57,091 --> 00:11:58,878
How do you explain that?

108
00:11:59,509 --> 00:12:04,755
I think it's because the
dancers are very beautiful.

109
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:09,802
People like to see beautiful
dancers on stage and

110
00:12:09,977 --> 00:12:13,095
listen to magical music.
No matter, wherever.

111
00:12:13,273 --> 00:12:18,985
Even in Russia they love
good music, despite everything...

112
00:12:19,154 --> 00:12:21,145
That's where ballet is at home.

113
00:12:21,322 --> 00:12:23,147
And Russia has produced the
greatest dancers, including you.

114
00:12:23,157 --> 00:12:24,568
Yes, I was born there.

115
00:12:24,742 --> 00:12:27,485
But we're trying to perfect the

116
00:12:27,662 --> 00:12:29,449
gesture, dancing a little bit better

117
00:12:29,622 --> 00:12:32,956
jumping a little higher than

118
00:12:33,126 --> 00:12:36,085
normal people do in a ballroom.

119
00:12:36,254 --> 00:12:39,042
This leads me to what I
actually wanted to talk about.

120
00:12:39,215 --> 00:12:41,582
They founded a dance school.  They teach.

121
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:44,547
Oh yeah.  The school was founded in

122
00:12:44,721 --> 00:12:46,963
1934 and we have many great dancers

123
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:52,556
and dancers produced.
Our focus is on young girls.

124
00:12:52,645 --> 00:12:56,389
Balanchine was always looking for the next one.

125
00:12:56,566 --> 00:13:00,230
There was a little girl in the
ballet company that he was

126
00:13:00,403 --> 00:13:02,109
very fond of, and he thought,
"Let's see how this turns out.

127
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,736
I'll give her a little role.

128
00:13:03,905 --> 00:13:08,149
There is this ballerina and
the next ballerina, I'm going

129
00:13:08,326 --> 00:13:11,195
to marry her and I'll see
what I can get out of her.

130
00:13:11,371 --> 00:13:13,822
I will choreograph for
these, but not for my wife."

131
00:13:13,832 --> 00:13:14,994
It was like this all the time.

132
00:13:15,168 --> 00:13:16,955
You want to know about his wives?

133
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:23,048
Mr. Balanchine had often
complained that Tamara

134
00:13:23,217 --> 00:13:26,130
Geva, his first wife,
was not a good dancer.

135
00:13:26,304 --> 00:13:31,594
But he was young, they were in
love, and, voila, they were married.

136
00:13:32,101 --> 00:13:36,311
He left Russia and married
Tamara Geva, and on

137
00:13:36,481 --> 00:13:42,818
the trip to America he
met Alexandra Danilova.

138
00:13:42,986 --> 00:13:46,775
Her skills corresponded
to his ideas of a dancer.

139
00:13:46,948 --> 00:13:53,036
So they worked together, he,
the choreographer, she, the artist.

140
00:13:53,205 --> 00:13:58,792
Then he met Vera Zorina.
She was called to Broadway.

141
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:02,203
They became a team and
went to Hollywood together.

142
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:06,465
I had often thought that
he really loved Zorina.

143
00:14:06,635 --> 00:14:12,802
But she single-mindedly pursued
her career and he was alone again.

144
00:14:13,141 --> 00:14:19,230
He met Maria Tallchief while
working with the <i>Ballet Russes</i>.

145
00:14:19,398 --> 00:14:22,515
She was a very different kind of dancer.

146
00:14:22,691 --> 00:14:26,732
She was fast, technically
excellent and very exotic.

147
00:14:26,905 --> 00:14:30,648
She was a half Indian,
from the Osage tribe.

148
00:14:30,826 --> 00:14:33,909
He discovered their special way of moving.

149
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:37,618
And Balanchine developed another new style.

150
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:42,330
Soon she left him for
another and he found Tanny.

151
00:14:42,503 --> 00:14:45,963
With her he created a new dance style.

152
00:14:46,132 --> 00:14:48,545
All women left him.

153
00:14:48,717 --> 00:14:54,634
They left him because of
career or because of other men.

154
00:14:54,807 --> 00:14:57,425
I can't say exactly why.

155
00:14:57,602 --> 00:15:01,436
I think it's hard living with a genius.

156
00:15:03,649 --> 00:15:08,269
Balanchine needed the unattainable.

157
00:15:08,404 --> 00:15:11,612
He had to be inspired by the unattainable.

158
00:15:11,907 --> 00:15:15,821
He was constantly
looking for a young dancer

159
00:15:15,994 --> 00:15:19,739
who could spark his enthusiasm to work with

160
00:15:19,915 --> 00:15:22,749
and with which he could achieve his goal.

161
00:15:22,919 --> 00:15:26,286
But once he had done that,
it was no longer possible.

162
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:30,423
Suddenly he had a real
woman by his side, not an ideal.

163
00:15:30,593 --> 00:15:33,552
She got pneumonia,
had her period and all...

164
00:15:34,222 --> 00:15:39,468
In many of his <i>Pas de deux</i>
men and women seek each other.

165
00:15:39,643 --> 00:15:41,679
You will often find this basic idea in his work.

166
00:15:41,854 --> 00:15:47,190
The man is looking for the ideal woman, finds her.

167
00:15:47,359 --> 00:15:50,692
They dance perfectly
together and then he loses her.

168
00:15:50,862 --> 00:15:55,653
Just like in <i>La Valse,</i> a great work of his,

169
00:15:55,826 --> 00:15:58,113
created at a particularly important time.

170
00:15:58,287 --> 00:16:02,201
With this ballet,
Balanchine evoked the very

171
00:16:02,374 --> 00:16:04,036
mood in which Ravel had composed the music,

172
00:16:04,209 --> 00:16:07,828
between two wars: the First
and the Second World War.

173
00:16:08,005 --> 00:16:09,370
The last waltz.

174
00:16:09,548 --> 00:16:12,837
The fall of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.

175
00:16:13,009 --> 00:16:16,629
The end of a wonderful era.  death comes

176
00:16:17,598 --> 00:16:21,057
seduces her with black jewels.

177
00:16:21,934 --> 00:16:25,019
She wears them and puts on the gloves.

178
00:16:25,355 --> 00:16:28,314
Death begins to dance with her.

179
00:16:28,483 --> 00:16:34,855
And the dance becomes frenetic, wild
through the music of the 20s and 30s.

180
00:16:35,031 --> 00:16:41,653
Embraced by this whirling figure of

181
00:16:41,829 --> 00:16:44,867
death, Tanny suddenly drops dead.

182
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:49,581
Death disappears and so does
her lover who is carrying her corpse.

183
00:16:49,754 --> 00:16:54,591
All the dancers on stage
spin counterclockwise

184
00:16:54,759 --> 00:16:59,629
in wild madness.  And this is the end.

185
00:17:08,105 --> 00:17:10,472
I can't talk about it anymore.

186
00:17:11,066 --> 00:17:15,778
People talked a lot about Balanchine's
so-called "white" ballet choreographies.

187
00:17:15,947 --> 00:17:19,440
But there were also his "black" ballets.

188
00:17:19,617 --> 00:17:25,157
I think he had an inkling
of what was about to

189
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:29,200
happen to Tanny, and he
expressed that in <i>La Valse</i>.

190
00:17:29,377 --> 00:17:33,086
I think he felt guilty about the ballet he

191
00:17:33,255 --> 00:17:36,498
created for the <i>March
of Dimes</i> organization.

192
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:38,967
Show business met to promote

193
00:17:39,137 --> 00:17:41,377
the <i>March Of Dimes</i> organization.

194
00:17:41,472 --> 00:17:43,884
The figureheads of this
action, Larry Mackenzie and

195
00:17:44,057 --> 00:17:45,844
Joya Moore raised funds to fight polio

196
00:17:46,018 --> 00:17:47,680


197
00:17:47,853 --> 00:17:49,453
at a fashion show at the Waldorf Astoria.

198
00:17:49,479 --> 00:17:51,436
Balanchine was asked in 1946

199
00:17:51,605 --> 00:17:56,647
if he would choreograph
a ballet for a benefit dinner.

200
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:59,858
Proceeds would go to the
<i>March of Dimes,</i> organization

201
00:18:00,032 --> 00:18:03,525
dedicated to fighting and curing polio.

202
00:18:03,702 --> 00:18:08,163
And he created a ballet that
was very reminiscent of <i>La Valse</i>.

203
00:18:08,331 --> 00:18:10,914
The ballerina dances happily, but

204
00:18:11,084 --> 00:18:14,953
then the mood and the music change

205
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:17,042
and the figure of polio appears.

206
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:19,879
Polio dances a somber <i>pas de deux</i>

207
00:18:20,052 --> 00:18:24,045
with her, at the end
of which she collapses.

208
00:18:25,014 --> 00:18:27,597
In this version there was a happy ending.

209
00:18:27,767 --> 00:18:32,512
But Tanny was the girl
Balanchine chose from among

210
00:18:32,688 --> 00:18:35,557
the students at the
<i>School Of American Ballet</i>

211
00:18:35,734 --> 00:18:37,645
to dance the victim's part.

212
00:18:37,819 --> 00:18:43,405
And, eerily enough, he
danced the part of polio.

213
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:51,824
I think Balanchine got into it
from day one when Tanny was the

214
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,788
<i>School Of American
Ballet</i>, interested in her.

215
00:18:54,961 --> 00:18:57,418
The interest increased more and more,

216
00:18:57,589 --> 00:18:59,671
the more she developed as a dancer.

217
00:19:06,888 --> 00:19:12,886
Because of her uniqueness,
Tanny only danced solo parts.

218
00:19:13,062 --> 00:19:17,978
Watching her made her look
more like a model on the catwalk.

219
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:21,985
Nowadays this is no
longer unusual for our eyes.

220
00:19:22,154 --> 00:19:24,487
Dancers have gotten taller, thinner.

221
00:19:24,657 --> 00:19:25,943
They became more

222
00:19:26,117 --> 00:19:28,450
what has been called the
ideal Balanchine dancer.

223
00:19:28,536 --> 00:19:32,405
Tanny didn't have a perfect classic body.

224
00:19:32,581 --> 00:19:37,292
And her dance style was elegant and original.

225
00:19:37,461 --> 00:19:41,876
Although Balanchine
attached great importance

226
00:19:42,048 --> 00:19:44,040
to classical music and loved dancers,

227
00:19:44,217 --> 00:19:49,053
who could dance the
traditional steps in a beautiful

228
00:19:49,222 --> 00:19:52,932
way, he was always looking
for the special dancers.

229
00:19:53,102 --> 00:19:55,936
Those who showed their
own personality on stage.

230
00:19:56,104 --> 00:19:58,221
They then became his muses.

231
00:20:59,292 --> 00:21:04,628
Is there a certain dancer who
impresses you, who inspires you?

232
00:21:04,796 --> 00:21:06,254
Tanaquil LeClercq.

233
00:21:10,928 --> 00:21:15,514
I saw her performance in <i>Symphonie in C</i>.

234
00:21:20,062 --> 00:21:26,650
It was at a time when everyone
danced them so enthusiastically

235
00:21:26,818 --> 00:21:31,938
and I fell in love with
this ballet immediately.

236
00:21:34,535 --> 00:21:40,656
I cried when Tanny leaned back.

237
00:21:41,751 --> 00:21:45,414
I just thought I really wanted
to work with this company.

238
00:21:47,004 --> 00:21:50,498
Her talent showed in everything.

239
00:21:50,675 --> 00:21:53,760
If you look at the roles in

240
00:21:53,929 --> 00:21:55,920
this ballet I created for Tanny,

241
00:21:56,098 --> 00:21:58,464
think five or six different
women would have to dance that.

242
00:21:58,474 --> 00:22:01,764
No one could do it alone.  Tanny could

243
00:22:01,937 --> 00:22:04,224
dance it in concert, in a wild, crazy way

244
00:22:04,397 --> 00:22:06,515
very elegant or very classic.

245
00:22:06,692 --> 00:22:10,777
She could express all four temperaments.

246
00:22:10,946 --> 00:22:14,735
She was a phenomenal dancer.

247
00:22:19,913 --> 00:22:21,245
"Dear Tanny!

248
00:22:21,415 --> 00:22:24,703
Today I realized how
much you are on my mind.

249
00:22:24,875 --> 00:22:29,040
I bought something in Florence,
something completely nonsensical.

250
00:22:29,213 --> 00:22:31,250
I looked at it and thought how

251
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:33,504
fun it would be to show you.

252
00:22:33,592 --> 00:22:36,960
How much you would love it and
how you would enjoy it as much as I do.

253
00:22:37,138 --> 00:22:40,723
In fact, whatever I see or happen to me, I

254
00:22:40,892 --> 00:22:43,759
imagine that you see or experience it too.

255
00:22:43,936 --> 00:22:48,146
And almost subconsciously I wonder
what you would think about that.

256
00:22:48,316 --> 00:22:54,154
Whether you like it or not.
You can tell I miss you a lot."

257
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:59,279
There was also a very close friendship

258
00:22:59,452 --> 00:23:02,286
between Jerome Robbins and Tanny.

259
00:23:02,454 --> 00:23:06,324
They worked together in
the <i>New York City Ballet</i> in

260
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,708
1948, in the very early days
of that company's founding.

261
00:23:08,878 --> 00:23:12,792
And they already knew each other
from the <i>School Of American Ballet.</i>

262
00:23:12,965 --> 00:23:16,174
He was a little older than Tanny.

263
00:23:16,344 --> 00:23:19,462
Jerry was already famous,
he had danced some

264
00:23:19,638 --> 00:23:25,430
sensational roles in the
<i>American Ballet Theatre</i>,

265
00:23:25,602 --> 00:23:28,812
where he was employed and he was

266
00:23:28,981 --> 00:23:30,438
on his way to success on Broadway.

267
00:23:30,858 --> 00:23:34,727
Though in a sense they were

268
00:23:34,904 --> 00:23:38,113
companions and not far apart in age,

269
00:23:38,282 --> 00:23:41,741
Jerry was already much
higher up the corporate ladder.

270
00:23:41,911 --> 00:23:46,575
Back then, Tanny was I don't want to

271
00:23:46,748 --> 00:23:49,491
say "shy" because she never really was.

272
00:23:49,667 --> 00:23:53,661
But she was the more serious young dancer.

273
00:23:53,838 --> 00:23:58,299
She wanted to please, to achieve something.

274
00:23:58,468 --> 00:24:05,386
In her eyes Jerry had already
made it, he had the success.

275
00:24:06,434 --> 00:24:09,927
"Tanny unfolds her dancing
quality more and more.

276
00:24:10,105 --> 00:24:12,768
She reminds me of a young
animal that is slowly developing.

277
00:24:12,942 --> 00:24:14,683
Like a clumsy foal that bursts

278
00:24:14,859 --> 00:24:17,943
out with elegance and grace.

279
00:24:18,113 --> 00:24:20,447
A kind of aura lingers around her.

280
00:24:20,616 --> 00:24:23,652
All the ballets I choreographed for

281
00:24:23,827 --> 00:24:25,442
the company were always for Tanny."

282
00:25:23,428 --> 00:25:27,341
How can you not love the
ballerina you dance with?

283
00:25:27,515 --> 00:25:30,973
I mean you're together, you feel her

284
00:25:31,143 --> 00:25:33,602
weight, smell her sweat, you taste her

285
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:37,014
and dance the love <i>pas de deux.</i> with her

286
00:25:56,167 --> 00:25:59,410
<i>Afternoon of a Faun</i> was
choreographed for Tanny.

287
00:25:59,588 --> 00:26:02,251
She had an incredible undercurrent
of eroticism that promised

288
00:26:02,424 --> 00:26:08,169
so much.  And that was more
exciting than anything obvious.

289
00:26:10,307 --> 00:26:13,891
Jerry Robbins came up with
the idea of ​​the wonderful ballet

290
00:26:14,061 --> 00:26:17,680
<i>Afternoon of a Faun</i> from

291
00:26:17,856 --> 00:26:21,190
1912 with young, naive dancers.

292
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:27,481
He choreographed it in
a studio clad in mirrors.

293
00:26:27,657 --> 00:26:31,742
The artists were dancers and
spectators at the same time.

294
00:26:31,911 --> 00:26:37,327
A brilliant idea.  And everyone
could see how beautiful Tanny is in it.

295
00:26:38,376 --> 00:26:40,083
She put one on.

296
00:26:40,253 --> 00:26:45,419
Tanny had that certain
something and knew how to use it.

297
00:26:45,591 --> 00:26:48,459
She had an irresistible presence.

298
00:26:48,636 --> 00:26:51,925
Tanny knew exactly how to
seduce people, how to delight them.

299
00:26:52,098 --> 00:26:56,639
She was fascinating.  She
could charm anyone she wanted.

300
00:26:58,646 --> 00:27:02,356
"Tanny I love you so much for your class.

301
00:27:02,525 --> 00:27:06,815
She is so real.  I often have to close my

302
00:27:06,988 --> 00:27:09,947
eyes to so much directness and insight.

303
00:27:10,115 --> 00:27:14,530
Are you mad at me because of
George, or because of yourself?

304
00:27:14,704 --> 00:27:18,288
And how do we feel about each other now?"

305
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,912
"I thought we could deal with how we

306
00:27:21,085 --> 00:27:22,996
felt about ourselves and about others.

307
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:24,331
Now I don't know.

308
00:27:24,505 --> 00:27:27,168
Anyway, I'm staying with George.

309
00:27:27,341 --> 00:27:30,459
I love talking to you, playing

310
00:27:30,635 --> 00:27:33,800
games with you, laughing out loud.

311
00:27:33,973 --> 00:27:39,469
But I love George.  Maybe
it's because he was there first."

312
00:27:43,273 --> 00:27:45,811
"George is your ideal. Good.

313
00:27:45,984 --> 00:27:50,945
But don't act like a little kid and
expect everyone to be who they are.

314
00:27:51,114 --> 00:27:53,026
He is also my ideal.

315
00:27:53,199 --> 00:27:57,911
I admire him as a person and
as an artist he is a god to me.

316
00:27:58,079 --> 00:28:02,119
But how you feel about him
influences how you feel about me."

317
00:28:04,336 --> 00:28:07,829
Of course she was flattered
by Jerry's interest in her.

318
00:28:08,006 --> 00:28:10,464
Jerry was certainly in
love with her in a way.

319
00:28:10,635 --> 00:28:12,876
But everyone had sensed immediately that

320
00:28:13,053 --> 00:28:17,218
Balanchine was also very interested in her.

321
00:28:17,390 --> 00:28:20,133
So it didn't surprise anyone.

322
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:23,302
I remember that he
wanted to give her jewelry

323
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,391
and she was so embarrassed
that she asked me

324
00:28:25,564 --> 00:28:28,272
come along to this posh jeweler.

325
00:28:28,443 --> 00:28:31,277
I can't remember the name, but

326
00:28:31,445 --> 00:28:34,234
it was Balanchine's favorite shop.

327
00:28:34,407 --> 00:28:37,320
He had shopped there
for all his old flames.

328
00:28:37,494 --> 00:28:39,694
It was inevitable that he would target

329
00:28:39,828 --> 00:28:41,616
her, because that was his pattern.

330
00:28:41,789 --> 00:28:44,372
It seemed to me that he...

331
00:28:48,003 --> 00:28:50,837
I wasn't too thrilled that he focused

332
00:28:51,006 --> 00:28:56,173
almost all of his attention on Tanny.

333
00:28:58,682 --> 00:29:02,767
Each of the dancers did
their best in the hope that the

334
00:29:02,936 --> 00:29:08,181
choreographer would notice
them.  But everyone also knew

335
00:29:08,357 --> 00:29:10,269
that each of them did.

336
00:29:10,442 --> 00:29:13,185
So they were all always extremely

337
00:29:13,362 --> 00:29:14,694
excited and at a high level.

338
00:29:30,129 --> 00:29:33,248
I often went to rehearsals.

339
00:29:33,424 --> 00:29:40,012
The room immediately overwhelmed
you with what was going on.

340
00:29:40,181 --> 00:29:44,173
And what also overwhelmed
you in Balanchine's

341
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:47,639
classroom was the
plethora of perfume clouds.

342
00:29:47,813 --> 00:29:50,520
You entered and you were immediately

343
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:53,308
in an explosion of different scents,

344
00:29:53,485 --> 00:29:57,024
because Balanchine liked
perfume.  All the girls dabbed

345
00:29:57,196 --> 00:29:59,153
themselves with it, and of
course each had a different one.

346
00:30:00,117 --> 00:30:04,861
But you could also feel the
tension.  Almost physical.

347
00:30:05,038 --> 00:30:07,030
A pleasant tension.

348
00:30:09,083 --> 00:30:12,703
There was only one star in their solar

349
00:30:12,879 --> 00:30:15,122
system and that was George Balanchine.

350
00:30:15,298 --> 00:30:18,337
Everything Tanny ever
said about him testified to her

351
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:23,755
total dedication to him as
a person and as an artist.

352
00:30:28,102 --> 00:30:32,142
They married New Year's Eve 1952.

353
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:13,432
Allegra Kent, who he was
mad about, said so beautifully:

354
00:31:13,897 --> 00:31:17,642
"He had loved us all, to varying degrees."

355
00:31:51,434 --> 00:31:55,769
Balanchine was fascinated
by the unattainable.

356
00:32:10,537 --> 00:32:14,702
Of course, Jerome Robbins
was particularly kind to her.

357
00:32:14,875 --> 00:32:16,741
Balanchine once told me a

358
00:32:16,919 --> 00:32:20,082
conversation between Jerry and Tanny

359
00:32:20,255 --> 00:32:23,248
sound like birds talking to each other.

360
00:32:23,425 --> 00:32:26,384
He meant that he wouldn't
understand a word of it.

361
00:32:26,553 --> 00:32:28,544
It was their conversation.

362
00:32:29,263 --> 00:32:30,263
"Dear Tanny!

363
00:32:30,431 --> 00:32:32,469
I got back to Rome
yesterday and immediately

364
00:32:32,641 --> 00:32:34,759
rushed to the <i>American Express</i> today

365
00:32:34,935 --> 00:32:37,849
and found three letters
and a postcard from you.

366
00:32:38,022 --> 00:32:39,559
I kiss you on both cheeks.

367
00:32:39,732 --> 00:32:41,724
I want to see you, tease you a little.

368
00:32:41,901 --> 00:32:45,815
I want you to make fun
of me or just ignore me.

369
00:32:45,988 --> 00:32:48,401
I think of you.  Your J."

370
00:32:50,452 --> 00:32:52,033
"I hope you are happy.

371
00:32:52,202 --> 00:32:55,695
I'm so glad you exist.  I wish I...

372
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:58,491
With love, Tanny."

373
00:33:00,003 --> 00:33:05,543
I think life around her was
getting a little too narrow for her.

374
00:33:05,716 --> 00:33:07,799
She had to turn to Mr. Balanchine,

375
00:33:07,968 --> 00:33:09,550
to deal with her mother.

376
00:33:09,719 --> 00:33:11,507
To do this, she had to do justice to her art.

377
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:17,051
Long hours, long nights.
That was her professional life.

378
00:33:17,227 --> 00:33:20,185
Tanny always had to be
around her husband, who was

379
00:33:20,356 --> 00:33:25,647
constantly looking for new
people, new challenges.

380
00:33:25,819 --> 00:33:29,108
Surrounding herself was
her overprotective mother,

381
00:33:29,281 --> 00:33:34,151
whose constant presence
Tanny wasn't too keen on.

382
00:33:34,328 --> 00:33:37,366
We called them the "Royal Family".

383
00:34:14,826 --> 00:34:16,034
That was great.

384
00:34:16,202 --> 00:34:18,194
- Wasn't that beautiful?
- Very beautiful!

385
00:34:20,039 --> 00:34:21,827
When you see something
like this, you realize

386
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,993
how much effort and skill is behind it,

387
00:34:26,170 --> 00:34:28,332
to create such a great ballet.

388
00:34:28,505 --> 00:34:30,964
Yes, that is indeed true.
I would like to introduce you...

389
00:34:31,134 --> 00:34:33,084
Especially when you see
such a gifted dancing couple.

390
00:34:33,094 --> 00:34:36,427
Our prima ballerina Tanaquil LeClercq.
- Hi.

391
00:34:36,597 --> 00:34:40,307
And our master dancer Jacques d'Amboise.
- Hello, how are you?

392
00:34:40,476 --> 00:34:44,059
The two most famous and best
ballet dancers in our country.

393
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:46,030
Of course we enjoyed your performance!

394
00:34:46,149 --> 00:34:48,057
- I've always wanted to know...
- You pant.

395
00:34:48,067 --> 00:34:52,152
...how a ballet dancer
feels after a performance.

396
00:34:52,321 --> 00:34:53,983
wheezing and panting.

397
00:34:54,157 --> 00:34:56,740
It was a grand performance.

398
00:34:56,909 --> 00:34:59,819
You will soon be opening your
spring tour here in New York this year.

399
00:34:59,829 --> 00:35:03,822
Yes, next Tuesday at
City Center on 55th Street.

400
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,535
- Class.
- Hope you all come!

401
00:35:05,709 --> 00:35:07,746
Other boys and girls can too

402
00:35:07,919 --> 00:35:10,503
See you and your ballet
company in other cities?

403
00:35:10,672 --> 00:35:13,210
Yes, we dance in Chicago too.  On the 3rd of April?
- Yes.

404
00:35:13,383 --> 00:35:15,545
- At the <i>Chicago Civic Opera House.</i>
- What are you performing?

405
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:17,800
- The Nutcracker in full length.
- Oh, the ballet.

406
00:35:17,929 --> 00:35:19,671
A two-hour ballet!

407
00:35:19,848 --> 00:35:20,848
With lots of kids!

408
00:35:20,891 --> 00:35:23,805
Lots of children, fir trees, snow,
everything for the Christmas season.

409
00:35:23,977 --> 00:35:26,891
Then don't miss this,
boys and girls in Chicago!

410
00:35:27,064 --> 00:35:29,424
And then you go on a
big tour through Europe?

411
00:35:29,524 --> 00:35:33,519
- Yes, we start in August.
- Yes, to Vienna, Salzburg...

412
00:35:33,696 --> 00:35:36,563
Everywhere.  Even to Finland!

413
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:38,823
Thank you for dancing

414
00:35:38,992 --> 00:35:40,450
for us and for coming to us.

415
00:35:40,535 --> 00:35:43,153
I want to talk about this tour.

416
00:35:51,295 --> 00:35:54,880
The schedule was tight.
Many of the rehearsal rooms were freezing.

417
00:35:55,050 --> 00:35:58,009
We coughed at each other
and still danced together.

418
00:35:58,178 --> 00:36:02,296
I got bronchitis.  And Tanny too.

419
00:36:18,824 --> 00:36:22,408
The company danced their
last performance in Cologne and

420
00:36:22,577 --> 00:36:26,991
they were supposed to fly to
Copenhagen the next morning.

421
00:36:27,164 --> 00:36:29,622
Tanny and I danced the <i>Afternoon of a Faun</i>

422
00:36:29,792 --> 00:36:32,034
and the <i>Western Symphony.</i>

423
00:36:32,211 --> 00:36:36,831
Then the curtain fell and I
hugged her.  I went to bed early.

424
00:36:37,007 --> 00:36:39,715
The next day I flew to New York.

425
00:36:39,886 --> 00:36:42,548
I wanted to be there when my son was born.

426
00:36:43,639 --> 00:36:45,801
So I said goodbye to her.

427
00:36:46,433 --> 00:36:52,055
She didn't look well and she was
very, very tired and very, very thin.

428
00:36:52,231 --> 00:36:55,815
On the trip she had told me
in confidence that she would

429
00:36:55,986 --> 00:36:59,275
have preferred not to
have gone on this tour at all.

430
00:36:59,446 --> 00:37:03,111
She and Mr. Balanchine had a
home in Weston, Connecticut.

431
00:37:03,284 --> 00:37:07,948
She said she would much
rather spend longer periods

432
00:37:08,121 --> 00:37:10,865
there than be somewhere
else almost every day.

433
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:14,579
She felt exhausted.  You could see

434
00:37:14,752 --> 00:37:16,994
that and there were also rumors that

435
00:37:17,173 --> 00:37:22,509
that the relationship
between her and Balanchine...

436
00:37:24,762 --> 00:37:27,096
...should be disturbed.

437
00:37:27,683 --> 00:37:29,719
The first time she told me she felt sick

438
00:37:29,894 --> 00:37:35,356
was on the night of her last performance.

439
00:37:35,523 --> 00:37:38,766
I was sitting in her dressing room
because I had to mend something

440
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:40,731
I don't remember what it was -

441
00:37:40,905 --> 00:37:43,989
and she got ready for <i>Swan Lake</i>.

442
00:37:44,157 --> 00:37:46,277
I asked her "How are you?" and she replied:

443
00:37:46,451 --> 00:37:50,445
"I feel awful.
I'm in pain from head to toe."

444
00:37:50,622 --> 00:37:53,831
I offered her a pill that
relaxes the muscles.

445
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,037
She said, "Oh, yes, give me one!"

446
00:37:58,254 --> 00:37:59,745
I remember the evening.

447
00:37:59,923 --> 00:38:05,340
We were in Denmark preparing
for the <i>Western Symphony</i>.

448
00:38:05,511 --> 00:38:08,721
Tanny also had another appearance.

449
00:38:08,891 --> 00:38:12,930
She said to me, "I don't
know Arthur, I feel so stiff."

450
00:38:13,103 --> 00:38:17,312
"No wonder," I replied, "it's cold
here, we need to warm up more."

451
00:38:17,483 --> 00:38:20,395
Then we went out and danced.

452
00:38:20,568 --> 00:38:25,608
The next morning, when
everyone got together to

453
00:38:25,781 --> 00:38:31,448
take the train to the next
venue, Tanny was missing.

454
00:38:32,412 --> 00:38:37,658
I got a call around
6:00, 6:30 on the morning

455
00:38:37,835 --> 00:38:42,751
we were supposed to continue to Stockholm.

456
00:38:42,924 --> 00:38:47,043
I was told Tanny was in the "iron

457
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:50,463
lung", she had polio and was dying.

458
00:38:51,432 --> 00:38:55,221
We decided not to tell anyone until

459
00:38:55,395 --> 00:38:58,388
we were on the train to Stockholm.

460
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:04,810
Betty Cage, our general manager,
informed the ballet management.

461
00:39:04,987 --> 00:39:08,151
Because she was so upset
and confused, we thought

462
00:39:08,323 --> 00:39:11,487
it would be easier for
her with the older people

463
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:13,276
to talk about the new situation.

464
00:39:13,578 --> 00:39:15,535
I was responsible

465
00:39:15,706 --> 00:39:18,870
to talk to the young girls
of the ballet company.

466
00:39:19,042 --> 00:39:22,285
Then, once we got on the train, it

467
00:39:22,462 --> 00:39:26,422
turned out that my task was the easiest.

468
00:39:26,591 --> 00:39:31,882
All young girls had been
vaccinated against polio.

469
00:39:32,056 --> 00:39:36,300
You can imagine the panic
otherwise there would have been!

470
00:39:36,476 --> 00:39:38,934
Betty had to do the hardest work.

471
00:39:39,105 --> 00:39:42,563
Everyone she needed
to speak to were Tanny's

472
00:39:42,733 --> 00:39:45,725
friends and none were
vaccinated.  You collapsed.

473
00:39:49,573 --> 00:39:53,191
The tragedy of Tanny is huge... huge!

474
00:39:56,287 --> 00:39:59,656
She was destroyed as a dancer.

475
00:40:03,587 --> 00:40:08,332
And she had this terrible disease, polio!

476
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:13,344
My name is Virus Poliomyelitis.

477
00:40:13,847 --> 00:40:18,637
I cause a disease you call "polio."

478
00:40:19,728 --> 00:40:24,518
Few diseases have
caused such a stir and terror.

479
00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:27,808
The polio virus strikes without warning.

480
00:40:27,985 --> 00:40:30,147
THE CRIPPERS 1940 RKO PATHÉ

481
00:40:30,321 --> 00:40:34,065
Nobody knows who gets sick.
Some die from it.

482
00:40:34,283 --> 00:40:37,447
When we wanted to start our journey through

483
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:39,361
Europe, we learned about the vaccinations.

484
00:40:39,538 --> 00:40:42,781
We all got vaccinated.

485
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,710
A day or two before we left,

486
00:40:46,879 --> 00:40:48,541
we lined up to get vaccinated.

487
00:40:48,714 --> 00:40:50,790
The ballerinas let themselves be
given the injection one after the other.

488
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:54,009
There was Melissa and Pat Wilde
and whatever their names were.

489
00:40:54,178 --> 00:40:58,513
I picked mine up.  Tanny was also in line.

490
00:40:58,682 --> 00:41:03,428
Suddenly she swerved, came to me and said:

491
00:41:03,604 --> 00:41:05,936
"I always get sick on a plane.

492
00:41:06,107 --> 00:41:09,350
And if I also got this injection...

493
00:41:09,527 --> 00:41:11,142
I'll wait until we get back."

494
00:41:11,152 --> 00:41:14,816
The authorities in Sweden
found out that we had a

495
00:41:14,990 --> 00:41:17,948
case of polio in our company
and stopped the train.

496
00:41:18,119 --> 00:41:20,076
They sent a medical team and

497
00:41:20,246 --> 00:41:24,081
insisted that each of us be vaccinated.

498
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:26,867
Some had two vaccinations.

499
00:41:27,044 --> 00:41:31,913
You hoped in God 'cause the show

500
00:41:32,091 --> 00:41:34,047
had to go on and you had to make it

501
00:41:34,218 --> 00:41:38,053
that everyone remained calm
and that no panic broke out.

502
00:41:38,222 --> 00:41:40,805
Our dancers and crew were

503
00:41:40,974 --> 00:41:42,682
awaiting word on how Tanny was doing.

504
00:41:44,853 --> 00:41:50,394
It blew my mind.  And probably

505
00:41:50,567 --> 00:41:53,355
every dancer who has ever danced.

506
00:41:54,696 --> 00:41:59,407
That's why I say it was mystical.
Tanny is a myth.

507
00:42:01,202 --> 00:42:03,990
She was badly battered, but not dead.

508
00:42:10,003 --> 00:42:14,418
But she could no longer move her legs.

509
00:43:55,982 --> 00:44:02,230
Polio in 1956. That's what it
looks like, that's what it sounds like.

510
00:44:10,371 --> 00:44:12,455
You'll hear the breath of life pumping

511
00:44:12,623 --> 00:44:15,207
in these tank-like breathing devices.

512
00:44:15,377 --> 00:44:17,334
They are called "iron lungs".

513
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:36,728
Tanny was in an "iron lung".

514
00:44:39,025 --> 00:44:41,984
Mr. Balanchine stayed
with her in the hospital.

515
00:44:43,654 --> 00:44:47,022
Even when we finished
our tour in Stockholm and

516
00:44:47,199 --> 00:44:52,411
returned to New York, he
stayed with her in Copenhagen.

517
00:45:02,340 --> 00:45:04,956
"Why can't I be brave and strong?

518
00:45:08,053 --> 00:45:09,965
I'm so afraid.

519
00:45:15,727 --> 00:45:17,094
i cry all the time

520
00:45:17,647 --> 00:45:21,857
I can't stop feeling sorry for myself.

521
00:45:22,484 --> 00:45:26,104
I keep asking myself: why me?

522
00:45:26,656 --> 00:45:28,021
Why polio?

523
00:45:36,874 --> 00:45:38,910
I'm rid of my respirator!

524
00:45:39,042 --> 00:45:40,042
Forever.

525
00:45:41,128 --> 00:45:44,121
You got me out of the Iron Lung today."

526
00:45:51,763 --> 00:45:56,178
"Dear Jerry! This is a letter
written with the right hand.

527
00:45:56,351 --> 00:45:58,263
I keep my hand in place and type and Eddie

528
00:45:58,436 --> 00:46:02,180
keeps moving the paper like a typewriter.

529
00:46:02,357 --> 00:46:04,770
I tried it first with my left hand like

530
00:46:04,943 --> 00:46:08,812
I always write, but it's impossible.

531
00:46:11,074 --> 00:46:14,363
The days creep by.  It's better now.

532
00:46:14,537 --> 00:46:18,781
But in the beginning I had
crazy hopes that I would return

533
00:46:18,957 --> 00:46:21,665
to New York completely
healthy.  But that's nonsense."

534
00:46:22,752 --> 00:46:25,711
"Now it's a bit of a routine.

535
00:46:25,879 --> 00:46:30,340
Breakfast at 8.00 am, at 9.00 am I
roll onto my side and my bed is made.

536
00:46:30,510 --> 00:46:32,296
At 10 a.m. hot packs,
then manipulations, as

537
00:46:32,470 --> 00:46:35,507
they call them.
mobilization of the joints.

538
00:46:35,681 --> 00:46:37,968
After that George and Edith visit me.

539
00:46:38,143 --> 00:46:41,431
Then I read or check my
mail.  Please write to me."

540
00:46:44,106 --> 00:46:46,723
"You can tell I'm doing better mentally.

541
00:46:46,901 --> 00:46:50,109
It's going slowly.  Oh god, how slow!

542
00:46:50,779 --> 00:46:53,021
George looks awful."

543
00:46:55,910 --> 00:46:56,990
"Dear Jerry!

544
00:46:57,161 --> 00:46:59,403
I raised the headboard
of my bed further, so I'll

545
00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:02,870
write you again, because
unfortunately you don't.

546
00:47:03,042 --> 00:47:04,202
I WAITING FOR A LETTER.

547
00:47:04,376 --> 00:47:07,163
I'm almost sitting in
bed, the sisters allowed it.

548
00:47:07,336 --> 00:47:09,829
I try to sit alone without support.

549
00:47:10,006 --> 00:47:11,669
What a strange feeling.

550
00:47:11,841 --> 00:47:13,049
It is very difficult.

551
00:47:13,218 --> 00:47:14,800
I feel like a fillet of fish

552
00:47:14,969 --> 00:47:16,849
trying to balance on its tail.

553
00:47:18,182 --> 00:47:20,174
I'm very famous here in Denmark.

554
00:47:20,350 --> 00:47:22,808
My photo was in the newspaper
along with Grace Kelly's and

555
00:47:22,978 --> 00:47:26,392
silversmith G. Jensen is calling
his new collection 'Tanaquil'.

556
00:47:28,233 --> 00:47:30,395
My legs are still dead.

557
00:47:30,569 --> 00:47:34,984
They are shocked with electric
batons three times a week.

558
00:47:35,157 --> 00:47:38,070
If only I could feel something

559
00:47:38,243 --> 00:47:40,326
inside them, move a muscle!

560
00:47:41,705 --> 00:47:43,739
When I think about the past, I cry.

561
00:47:43,749 --> 00:47:45,115
She seems so wonderful to me.

562
00:47:45,291 --> 00:47:47,203
The future is far away, blurry.

563
00:47:47,376 --> 00:47:49,288
Only the present remains for me."

564
00:47:57,178 --> 00:47:59,637
"The nurses washed my hair this afternoon.

565
00:47:59,806 --> 00:48:00,967
They've gotten very long.

566
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:05,260
I wish they would leave
her alone.  You don't smell.

567
00:48:05,437 --> 00:48:07,554
With love Tan."

568
00:48:10,484 --> 00:48:13,022
"Did you know that there
are hospital rooms here

569
00:48:13,195 --> 00:48:15,777
that have windows to the
outside with stairs set up?

570
00:48:15,947 --> 00:48:18,406
That way your friends can
see you if you're contagious."

571
00:48:20,118 --> 00:48:22,609
"Why do all the sisters in
Denmark have body odor?

572
00:48:22,788 --> 00:48:27,531
I use deodorant, why
don't you?  It takes me half

573
00:48:27,708 --> 00:48:29,995
an hour to wash around
the front, then you shoot

574
00:48:30,169 --> 00:48:31,876
me on my side and wash me behind.

575
00:48:32,045 --> 00:48:34,834
Then comes the lady with
the bucket and the turd.

576
00:48:35,007 --> 00:48:37,841
She also has body odor.
This is really too much!"

577
00:48:42,431 --> 00:48:44,382
"I spoke to a very nice woman.

578
00:48:44,392 --> 00:48:47,135
She fell ill with polio in
Germany last summer.

579
00:48:47,311 --> 00:48:49,519
She can already climb stairs, step by step.

580
00:48:49,689 --> 00:48:51,476
And she walks, but on crutches.

581
00:48:51,649 --> 00:48:53,891
We've talked about the awfully

582
00:48:54,068 --> 00:48:55,560
long time it takes to recover.

583
00:48:55,570 --> 00:49:00,861
For severe cases like mine,
it takes three years or more.

584
00:49:02,410 --> 00:49:05,493
I no longer believe that I can
become completely healthy.

585
00:49:05,662 --> 00:49:08,279
Just a bit.

586
00:49:08,456 --> 00:49:12,666
Are you aware that I'll
be 30 in three years?

587
00:49:14,588 --> 00:49:18,958
Oh I always knew how
lucky I was and that something

588
00:49:19,135 --> 00:49:23,220
was going to happen
to George, mother or me.

589
00:49:23,389 --> 00:49:27,132
It couldn't always go
on like this, that you

590
00:49:27,310 --> 00:49:29,142
only win and never
have to pay a price for it.

591
00:49:29,312 --> 00:49:30,312
Tan."

592
00:49:33,691 --> 00:49:37,855
"Someone came in yesterday.
They got a room next to mine.

593
00:49:38,153 --> 00:49:42,272
She's very sick.  Today
she came to the 'Iron Lung'.

594
00:49:44,618 --> 00:49:46,199
That still scares me.

595
00:49:46,369 --> 00:49:49,156
Three days seems like an eternity to me."

596
00:49:51,707 --> 00:49:53,824
"George carries me to the chair.

597
00:49:54,002 --> 00:49:56,585
I would almost say he enjoys my condition.

598
00:49:56,755 --> 00:49:58,997
Some people seem to like the fact that

599
00:49:59,174 --> 00:50:01,507
someone is completely dependent on them.

600
00:50:01,676 --> 00:50:04,292
It's pouring down like a summer rain.

601
00:50:04,471 --> 00:50:07,430
It has become dark and
yellowish in the room."

602
00:50:12,353 --> 00:50:16,143
"I went to bed and slept and slept.

603
00:50:16,316 --> 00:50:18,558
And had daydreams.

604
00:50:18,735 --> 00:50:24,231
The sky I can see is beautiful.
With little pink clouds."

605
00:50:24,407 --> 00:50:27,069
"I want to tell you something.

606
00:50:27,242 --> 00:50:30,360
I feel like I have to tell you something,

607
00:50:30,537 --> 00:50:34,451
but I don't know what
it is.  Really strange.

608
00:50:34,625 --> 00:50:35,832
Love, T."

609
00:50:44,427 --> 00:50:47,545
She was transferred to
a hospital in New York.

610
00:50:47,721 --> 00:50:52,091
I visited her there.  That
was a very emotional moment.

611
00:50:52,267 --> 00:50:56,102
Although she could move
her arms, she was still in bed.

612
00:50:56,271 --> 00:51:02,394
When she saw me she burst
into tears and so did I.  Oh God.

613
00:51:03,530 --> 00:51:08,273
Every doctor at Lennox
Hill Hospital told Balanchine

614
00:51:08,450 --> 00:51:13,366
that she would be better
soon, but not how much better.

615
00:51:13,746 --> 00:51:17,832
She would have a window
of two, two and a half years

616
00:51:18,001 --> 00:51:21,996
in which her condition
would gradually improve.

617
00:51:22,172 --> 00:51:24,755
But she would never fully recover.

618
00:51:24,924 --> 00:51:27,462
Balanchine didn't want to believe that

619
00:51:28,594 --> 00:51:29,756
...don't accept.

620
00:51:30,097 --> 00:51:32,214
He got angry.

621
00:51:32,391 --> 00:51:35,429
"I will make her well, she
will be able to dance again!"

622
00:51:35,602 --> 00:51:38,561
He traveled to Warm Springs
and did everything in his power.

623
00:51:38,731 --> 00:51:43,101
He did exercises with her.  He bent her
legs, straightened them, like a therapist.

624
00:51:43,277 --> 00:51:51,150
He put her down, hugged her tightly
from behind.  He was shorter than her.

625
00:51:51,325 --> 00:51:56,821
He picked her up and placed

626
00:51:56,998 --> 00:52:00,082
her numb right foot on his right foot

627
00:52:00,252 --> 00:52:02,288
and her left on his left.

628
00:52:02,462 --> 00:52:04,419
So he practiced with her.

629
00:52:04,589 --> 00:52:09,380
He hoped this would ignite a spark in the

630
00:52:09,552 --> 00:52:13,216
muscles, that they would
remember how to walk.

631
00:52:26,026 --> 00:52:29,315
"It's beautiful here. So pretty.

632
00:52:29,489 --> 00:52:32,697
The houses are made of
red bricks with white columns.

633
00:52:32,866 --> 00:52:34,949
Georgian architecture.

634
00:52:35,118 --> 00:52:39,033
Most here have polio or are paraplegic.

635
00:52:39,206 --> 00:52:42,870
Most people are paralyzed
after a back accident.

636
00:52:43,252 --> 00:52:45,772
Most lying face down at
the foot of their stretchers

637
00:52:45,797 --> 00:52:49,461
are paraplegics, while the
others face up have polio.

638
00:52:49,634 --> 00:52:52,474
Today I watched a movie.
They have a nice cinema here.

639
00:52:52,512 --> 00:52:54,670
The first two rows are reserved
for the mobile stretchers.

640
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:56,797
Next row: wheelchairs.

641
00:52:56,974 --> 00:53:00,058
Then seats where George and Edith were.

642
00:53:00,228 --> 00:53:03,187
We checked out <i>The 12
Jury members</i>.  Fascinating!

643
00:53:04,899 --> 00:53:06,480
I have a single room

644
00:53:06,650 --> 00:53:08,809
With a window just to the
right at the foot of the bed.

645
00:53:08,819 --> 00:53:12,358
Simply divine!  The only catch
is that it's a bit noisy because

646
00:53:12,531 --> 00:53:15,740
it's adjacent to the room
where the bedpans are emptied.

647
00:53:15,909 --> 00:53:18,367
People have to do it in the
morning, at noon, in the evening."

648
00:53:21,706 --> 00:53:25,791
"I always go to the pool in
the afternoons now. Wonderful!

649
00:53:25,961 --> 00:53:27,793
There are chairs under the water.

650
00:53:27,964 --> 00:53:31,127
You sit on it and do arm exercises.

651
00:53:31,299 --> 00:53:35,543
I wear splints and a corset
and I have my crutches.

652
00:53:37,306 --> 00:53:41,015
I find that my mother is
doing surprisingly well.

653
00:53:41,184 --> 00:53:44,598
Her only daughter, a celebrated
dancer, and then: boom!

654
00:53:44,772 --> 00:53:47,228
That would have blown me away.

655
00:53:47,982 --> 00:53:49,565
But enough of that."

656
00:53:52,404 --> 00:53:55,647
"I'm successful! I have groupies!

657
00:53:55,824 --> 00:53:59,863
I'm a celebrity, say the
ladies in the bathroom.

658
00:54:00,036 --> 00:54:02,823
When we get together there with our various

659
00:54:02,998 --> 00:54:05,240
ailments, it's funny in a macabre way.

660
00:54:05,417 --> 00:54:07,704
But that's my sense of humor."

661
00:54:11,965 --> 00:54:15,629
"Dear Jerry! I'm desperate. Why don't

662
00:54:15,801 --> 00:54:18,135
you text me? And don't you call me?

663
00:54:18,305 --> 00:54:22,219
Full of anticipation, I came to my
room after my 10:00 a.m. exercise,

664
00:54:22,392 --> 00:54:24,850
and I hated the other
letters that were lying there!"

665
00:54:29,273 --> 00:54:33,062
"Dear Jerry! You see what a
difference one phone call makes!

666
00:54:35,487 --> 00:54:40,404
I feel different.  Suddenly I love you."

667
00:54:46,999 --> 00:54:48,786
"Be in good spirits, Tanny!

668
00:54:49,752 --> 00:54:53,712
So much of what's happened doesn't

669
00:54:53,881 --> 00:54:56,294
make sense, but never
forget that I love you

670
00:54:56,467 --> 00:54:59,757
and worry about everything
that concerns you."

671
00:55:02,431 --> 00:55:05,140
"Dear Jerry! I did a lot of

672
00:55:05,310 --> 00:55:07,721
laundry right after you left

673
00:55:07,894 --> 00:55:10,557
and smoked cigarettes like crazy.
You know:

674
00:55:10,730 --> 00:55:13,814
Keep yourself busy and
you won't worry so much.

675
00:55:13,983 --> 00:55:16,225
I'll think of those two days in the sun

676
00:55:16,402 --> 00:55:19,065
before I go to bed so I
can dream about them.

677
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:22,152
When I imagine the days and nights that lie

678
00:55:22,325 --> 00:55:25,443
ahead, they seem
unbearable, not worth living,

679
00:55:25,621 --> 00:55:31,491
but you should never
give up until you die, right?

680
00:55:31,669 --> 00:55:36,584
I'm putting my sunglasses away now.
I miss you.  With love, T."

681
00:55:39,842 --> 00:55:41,880
"I'm worried about George.

682
00:55:42,054 --> 00:55:44,888
He mentioned a friend
who has a friend who has

683
00:55:45,057 --> 00:55:48,800
a piece of the robe
of St. Peter or St. Paul.

684
00:55:48,977 --> 00:55:52,186
If you carry it close to you
and pray, you will be healed.

685
00:55:55,107 --> 00:55:58,146
That's not George at all.

686
00:55:58,319 --> 00:56:01,733
I'm afraid he has unrealistic
ideas about my illness.

687
00:56:03,283 --> 00:56:07,824
I told him on the phone
I didn't want to hear

688
00:56:07,996 --> 00:56:09,908
about it and he sounded
deeply disappointed.

689
00:56:10,791 --> 00:56:14,079
It's obviously easier to have polio

690
00:56:14,252 --> 00:56:16,960
than to be with someone who has it."

691
00:56:23,261 --> 00:56:26,504
Balanchine was always close to her.

692
00:56:28,098 --> 00:56:31,308
He firmly believed that if he prayed

693
00:56:31,476 --> 00:56:33,685
to his icon, she would get better.

694
00:56:33,855 --> 00:56:37,815
He was convinced that she

695
00:56:37,983 --> 00:56:40,976
would be better, he insisted.

696
00:56:43,614 --> 00:56:47,027
She was depressed but he
was by her side at the time.

697
00:56:48,578 --> 00:56:52,743
There were rumors that their
relationship was not going well

698
00:56:52,915 --> 00:56:58,252
before she fell ill.  But her
illness brought him back to her.

699
00:56:58,421 --> 00:57:02,290
"I saw the musical <i>On
Your Toes</i> on TV, very nice.

700
00:57:02,466 --> 00:57:05,926
Also the film <i>You've Never Been More
Charming</i> with Rita Hayworth and Astaire.

701
00:57:06,595 --> 00:57:09,053
It snowed all day yesterday.

702
00:57:09,222 --> 00:57:14,263
It looks adorable today.
Being at home is not easy.

703
00:57:14,436 --> 00:57:16,473
I think that might be me.

704
00:57:16,646 --> 00:57:19,263
It's hard for me to live here.

705
00:57:19,441 --> 00:57:22,434
I have to wait for the
girl to come and feed me.

706
00:57:22,611 --> 00:57:24,352
i feel like a dog

707
00:57:24,529 --> 00:57:30,447
Do you think that in the next life I will
be human and you will all be animals?"

708
00:57:32,829 --> 00:57:35,321
When Tanny was supposed to come home,

709
00:57:35,499 --> 00:57:38,867
we had a big problem how to deal with it.

710
00:57:39,044 --> 00:57:41,536
The apartment had to be modified so

711
00:57:41,713 --> 00:57:46,424
that she could move
freely in her wheelchair.

712
00:57:46,592 --> 00:57:50,131
But Balanchine even raised a cup

713
00:57:50,304 --> 00:57:53,012
rack so she couldn't reach it while seated.

714
00:57:53,183 --> 00:57:55,596
He wanted to force her to get up.

715
00:57:55,769 --> 00:57:57,343
Once she burst into tears and said:

716
00:57:57,353 --> 00:57:59,060
"I can't even get myself a cup!"

717
00:58:01,190 --> 00:58:05,275
"I watch more TV. <i>Frankenstein's son.</i>

718
00:58:05,444 --> 00:58:09,314
Today it is raining.
What desolate weather.

719
00:58:09,491 --> 00:58:14,236
I don't have anymore to
write, so I'll stop.  Tan."

720
00:58:17,499 --> 00:58:21,833
Whenever possible,
Mr. Balanchine practiced with her.

721
00:58:22,003 --> 00:58:25,587
He put together Pilates exercises for her

722
00:58:25,757 --> 00:58:27,918
and forced Tanny to make them.

723
00:58:28,092 --> 00:58:31,710
And not to forget, he kept moving her legs.

724
00:58:31,887 --> 00:58:34,595
They weren't rigid, they were flexible.

725
00:58:34,765 --> 00:58:38,929
Her motor memory had
forgotten the walking movements.

726
00:58:42,273 --> 00:58:46,313
Mr. Balanchine was very
interested in the Pilates method.

727
00:58:46,485 --> 00:58:48,101
He knew Mr. Pilates personally.

728
00:58:50,448 --> 00:58:55,068
He created special
exercises for her himself,

729
00:58:55,244 --> 00:58:58,328
which she completed alone or with him.

730
00:59:01,876 --> 00:59:04,414
<i>Agon</i> was the third part of a trilogy.

731
00:59:04,587 --> 00:59:08,171
Balanchine began with <i>Apollo,</i> in 1928

732
00:59:08,340 --> 00:59:13,677
then followed <i>Orpheus</i> and in
1957 the trilogy ended with <i>Agon.</i>

733
00:59:15,847 --> 00:59:19,716
With the <i>pas de deux</i> I had to bring the

734
00:59:19,894 --> 00:59:23,137
ballerina into new positions all the time.

735
00:59:23,314 --> 00:59:28,651
That was the exciting part because I

736
00:59:28,819 --> 00:59:32,027
moved her body, her feet and her legs.

737
00:59:45,794 --> 00:59:48,911
I took her body and placed it.

738
00:59:49,087 --> 00:59:52,581
I'm sure he got the inspiration

739
00:59:52,759 --> 00:59:55,251
from his daily practice with Tanny.

740
00:59:55,428 --> 00:59:59,092
I'm sure Tanny, as I know her,

741
00:59:59,265 --> 01:00:03,383
resisted these exercises at first.

742
01:00:03,561 --> 01:00:10,684
But she was strong willed
and eventually accepted them.

743
01:00:12,070 --> 01:00:14,688
She had no choice.  He made her do it.

744
01:00:14,864 --> 01:00:16,948
And Balanchine was not so easy to beat.

745
01:00:18,326 --> 01:00:22,991
"We're in the middle of ballet season.
I should be excited.

746
01:00:23,165 --> 01:00:24,576
But I'm not.

747
01:01:00,910 --> 01:01:04,278
And I don't feel for George
either when he calls.

748
01:01:05,248 --> 01:01:06,409
C'est la vie."

749
01:01:20,344 --> 01:01:24,008
You can imagine how difficult it was for

750
01:01:24,182 --> 01:01:29,177
her to have her body changed by polio.

751
01:01:29,354 --> 01:01:31,767
At first she gained a little weight,

752
01:01:31,940 --> 01:01:33,681
all the muscles in her legs shrank.

753
01:01:33,859 --> 01:01:36,772
It's certainly tough for anyone, but for a

754
01:01:36,945 --> 01:01:40,564
dancer whose body is
her everything, it really is

755
01:01:40,741 --> 01:01:42,573
incredibly difficult.

756
01:01:45,662 --> 01:01:51,623
She was no longer
interested in going to a ballet.

757
01:01:51,792 --> 01:01:58,289
But suddenly she changed her
mind.  So I got the car, carried

758
01:01:58,466 --> 01:02:04,383
her in, and we drove to a
ballet.  And we saw <i>La Valse</i>

759
01:02:04,555 --> 01:02:10,678
with the wonderful dancer Sarah
Leland.  Afterwards she criticized them.

760
01:02:18,320 --> 01:02:20,687
She was asked if she would like to

761
01:02:20,864 --> 01:02:23,901
train some dancers in her star roles.

762
01:02:24,076 --> 01:02:27,489
She enthusiastically agreed.  She
was back in ballet and she loved it.

763
01:02:30,873 --> 01:02:33,286
When I saw <i>Symphonie in C</i> I

764
01:02:33,459 --> 01:02:35,951
noticed that some things had changed.

765
01:02:36,128 --> 01:02:39,996
I couldn't say that was wrong, because I

766
01:02:40,174 --> 01:02:42,381
didn't know if Balanchine
made it specifically:

767
01:02:42,551 --> 01:02:46,044
"I hated how Tanny took that step, but

768
01:02:46,222 --> 01:02:50,091
now I got rid of her and found another one,

769
01:02:50,267 --> 01:02:53,760
and can finally make it dance the
way I've always wanted it to dance."

770
01:02:53,938 --> 01:02:55,638
I couldn't say, "No, it wasn't like that!"

771
01:02:55,648 --> 01:02:57,640
Maybe it's even better.

772
01:03:02,738 --> 01:03:08,826
She said it wasn't
bad at all, it was a gift.

773
01:03:10,745 --> 01:03:15,332
I asked, "What do you mean?"
She replied: "How was it always?

774
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:19,585
We have the Saturday
matinee off and George and I

775
01:03:19,754 --> 01:03:23,374
I'm eating croissants with butter and

776
01:03:23,550 --> 01:03:27,385
enjoying my café au
lait when the phone rings.

777
01:03:27,554 --> 01:03:30,172
George comes back from the call and says:

778
01:03:30,348 --> 01:03:35,719
'Patty Wilde is injured and
cannot dance <i>Swan Lake</i>.

779
01:03:35,895 --> 01:03:37,387
do you take over?'

780
01:03:41,151 --> 01:03:47,113
'It's my day off, but I'll go to
the bathroom and get ready.'

781
01:03:48,366 --> 01:03:51,825
And then she said: "Something like
that can never happen again now."

782
01:04:22,317 --> 01:04:26,652
you take a cat  While you can't train her,

783
01:04:26,821 --> 01:04:30,564
you can make her do whatever she wants.

784
01:04:30,741 --> 01:04:34,234
I have observed her
and been inspired by her.

785
01:04:34,412 --> 01:04:36,824
I played with her and she jumped.

786
01:04:36,997 --> 01:04:38,829
I developed this jump further.

787
01:04:38,999 --> 01:04:41,333
And she even jumped backwards!

788
01:04:41,502 --> 01:04:43,368
I was asked, "How did you teach her that?"

789
01:04:43,378 --> 01:04:45,245
"I didn't teach her that, she taught me!"

790
01:04:45,255 --> 01:04:49,796
What made her so special
was her cleverness, her wits.

791
01:04:49,969 --> 01:04:53,132
You can find out by reading a few

792
01:04:53,305 --> 01:04:55,718
excerpts from her book about the cat

793
01:04:55,892 --> 01:04:59,977
or what she wrote in the ballet's cookbook.

794
01:05:00,146 --> 01:05:03,729
There she wrote short biographies.

795
01:05:03,899 --> 01:05:09,110
She described each
individual so appropriately

796
01:05:09,278 --> 01:05:11,737
and accurately, as a
person and as a dancer.

797
01:05:11,906 --> 01:05:18,370
There was always a touch of humor about everything.

798
01:05:28,090 --> 01:05:33,302
Mr. Balanchine was getting on in years.

799
01:05:40,853 --> 01:05:44,642
He watched his youth fly away and

800
01:05:44,815 --> 01:05:52,815
unknowingly sought a way to cope with it.

801
01:05:54,031 --> 01:05:57,490
Some take refuge in a relationship,

802
01:05:57,660 --> 01:06:01,199
which is not necessarily the healthiest

803
01:06:01,832 --> 01:06:03,949
and best step is.

804
01:06:10,423 --> 01:06:14,508
He got to the point that he had to admit to

805
01:06:14,678 --> 01:06:19,048
himself that he didn't want
to be with her anymore.

806
01:06:19,224 --> 01:06:22,807
He wanted to be free.  Tanny in her

807
01:06:22,977 --> 01:06:25,094
wheelchair became a log against his leg.

808
01:06:25,272 --> 01:06:27,183
He had done everything for her.

809
01:06:27,355 --> 01:06:33,022
She sensed this and took the
first step.  That was really heroic.

810
01:06:56,636 --> 01:06:59,629
It was the premiere party of

811
01:06:59,805 --> 01:07:03,014
<i>A Midsummer Night's Dream.</i>

812
01:07:03,184 --> 01:07:08,473
Tanny was there, but
Balanchine was not at her table.

813
01:07:12,651 --> 01:07:17,897
That was the straw that
broke the camel's back.

814
01:07:18,865 --> 01:07:24,361
Tanny said, "He needs to be free.
He needs to be free."

815
01:07:34,297 --> 01:07:40,589
Balanchine and Tanny's
relationship had deteriorated greatly.

816
01:07:40,762 --> 01:07:44,301
I was at my apartment one morning
getting ready for work when the

817
01:07:44,474 --> 01:07:50,186
phone rang.  It was Betty Cage,
our General Manager, who said:

818
01:07:50,354 --> 01:07:56,272
"Tanny has moved out and is
now staying at the Mayflower Hotel."

819
01:07:56,443 --> 01:07:59,357
I replied, "Thank you for telling me."

820
01:07:59,531 --> 01:08:03,070
Then the phone rang
again, it was Balanchine.

821
01:08:03,242 --> 01:08:05,986
He said, "I'm staying at
the Empire Hotel now."

822
01:08:06,162 --> 01:08:07,698
Both had undressed without realizing

823
01:08:07,872 --> 01:08:10,910
that the other had undressed as well.

824
01:08:23,680 --> 01:08:27,843
I'm sure it was awful for her when he

825
01:08:28,017 --> 01:08:30,099
left her and fell in love with Suzanne.

826
01:08:30,269 --> 01:08:35,355
And even though Suzanne turned
Balanchine down, he was done with Tanny.

827
01:08:35,524 --> 01:08:39,484
That must have been very
hard.  People were shocked

828
01:08:39,653 --> 01:08:44,398
when he left Tanny
because he stayed with her

829
01:08:44,575 --> 01:08:47,409
and had done indescribably much for her.

830
01:08:47,578 --> 01:08:52,790
That impressed me very
much.  He brought her back to

831
01:08:52,958 --> 01:08:59,171
life, he made her understand
that life goes on for her.

832
01:08:59,340 --> 01:09:03,959
It was okay with her that
he had to move on now.

833
01:09:04,136 --> 01:09:06,344
She was a strong personality.

834
01:09:09,266 --> 01:09:12,679
She found that she was
independent, that she

835
01:09:12,852 --> 01:09:17,564
could socialize with
people and entertain them.

836
01:09:17,733 --> 01:09:23,023
She was very sociable, despite
being disabled by the disease.

837
01:09:24,114 --> 01:09:28,699
"Thank you, thank you, thank
you for two letters in two days!

838
01:09:28,869 --> 01:09:33,078
You're right, something
happened, but I don't know the

839
01:09:33,248 --> 01:09:36,035
hell what, or where it started,
or how it's going to end.

840
01:09:36,210 --> 01:09:38,827
It's a bit like our
relationship in general.

841
01:09:39,003 --> 01:09:43,123
Suddenly you're angry about
something, you don't talk about

842
01:09:43,300 --> 01:09:48,294
it, but both feel it and you
start getting a little mean

843
01:09:48,470 --> 01:09:50,463
and teases the other.

844
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:55,226
You know what I mean?  Anyway, I love you!"

845
01:09:56,771 --> 01:09:59,980
Obviously, the two
had a lot of fun together.

846
01:10:00,149 --> 01:10:04,519
Of course, he was a very different
personality from Mr. Balanchine.

847
01:10:04,695 --> 01:10:09,111
Jerry introduced her to many of
his friends, who also became her

848
01:10:09,283 --> 01:10:12,321
friends until the end of their
lives.  That led her to Europe.

849
01:10:14,331 --> 01:10:21,420
In the summer of 1972, Jerome
agreed to direct the festival in Spoleto.

850
01:10:23,297 --> 01:10:27,758
I'm sure it was his idea to invite Tanny.

851
01:10:29,261 --> 01:10:31,424
Italy is made of stairs, and Italy

852
01:10:31,597 --> 01:10:33,714
has the only opera house in the world

853
01:10:33,890 --> 01:10:36,883
called "The Staircase", <i>La Scala.</i>

854
01:10:37,060 --> 01:10:40,645
The stairs there were very smooth,

855
01:10:40,814 --> 01:10:46,812
worn down by feet for 300 years.

856
01:10:46,988 --> 01:10:50,402
The small theater was full.
We were at the back and the

857
01:10:50,574 --> 01:10:54,239
only possible space for a
wheelchair was at the exit.

858
01:10:54,411 --> 01:11:01,956
This meant that we completely
blocked the exit for the visitors.

859
01:11:02,128 --> 01:11:05,792
I thought, "I can't stop people,

860
01:11:05,965 --> 01:11:08,923
and I don't want them to overthrow

861
01:11:09,092 --> 01:11:13,757
Get Tanny and her wheelchair over there.
And it's only two steps."

862
01:11:14,389 --> 01:11:19,350
Tanny wasn't particularly difficult, but I

863
01:11:19,519 --> 01:11:22,557
couldn't find a foothold on the first step

864
01:11:22,731 --> 01:11:26,725
and the wheelchair slipped out of my hands

865
01:11:26,902 --> 01:11:34,902
and suddenly fell over.  Tanny
fell onto the marble foyer hallway.

866
01:11:35,702 --> 01:11:38,160
I stood there, stunned.

867
01:11:38,330 --> 01:11:44,874
Tanny crawled around on the
floor, looked at me, and said:

868
01:11:45,045 --> 01:11:49,084
"Now fuck me, pick me up!"

869
01:11:49,257 --> 01:11:51,589
That broke my rigidity,
I picked her up, put

870
01:11:51,759 --> 01:11:56,424
her back in the wheelchair
and we fled outside.

871
01:11:56,598 --> 01:11:59,510
In the end we went out
to eat and she ordered

872
01:11:59,684 --> 01:12:03,098
a whiskey.  Which she never did otherwise.

873
01:12:03,271 --> 01:12:08,608
She said it hurt like hell.

874
01:12:08,943 --> 01:12:12,153
When she saw my face she said:

875
01:12:12,322 --> 01:12:14,439
"Yes, my nerves are still working!"

876
01:12:14,782 --> 01:12:16,570
So she was in pain.

877
01:12:16,742 --> 01:12:19,907
Her bones had become even

878
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:22,537
more fragile from not being used.

879
01:12:22,707 --> 01:12:25,665
Although it was only a minor fall,

880
01:12:25,835 --> 01:12:29,326
it was enough to break her knee.

881
01:12:35,177 --> 01:12:37,635
I also dropped them once after

882
01:12:37,804 --> 01:12:41,298
we drank too much champagne.

883
01:12:41,475 --> 01:12:43,967
She just giggled.  You
could easily pick them up.

884
01:12:44,144 --> 01:12:46,727
Balanchine showed me how to do it.

885
01:12:46,897 --> 01:12:49,935
Once you've learned it, you've got it.

886
01:12:51,193 --> 01:12:55,188
She did everything alone.
She went to bed on her own,

887
01:12:55,364 --> 01:12:58,948
got up and washed herself.
She could do a lot on her own.

888
01:12:59,118 --> 01:13:01,735
She was strong, she
had a strong upper body.

889
01:13:01,912 --> 01:13:08,330
This and her indomitable will
to live independently helped her

890
01:13:08,501 --> 01:13:14,042
to the end of her life.  And
she has, for the last 25 years.

891
01:13:15,300 --> 01:13:18,510
Edith lived not far from Tanny.

892
01:13:18,679 --> 01:13:20,636
Tanny visited her occasionally,

893
01:13:20,805 --> 01:13:23,969
although they had a difficult relationship.

894
01:13:24,143 --> 01:13:26,099
Especially since her
mother thought that Tanny's

895
01:13:26,270 --> 01:13:29,888
illness would bring her
daughter back to her.

896
01:13:30,064 --> 01:13:33,604
"I have her back, I can take
care of her, visit her every day

897
01:13:33,777 --> 01:13:37,896
and cook for her."  That's
exactly what Tanny didn't want.

898
01:13:38,072 --> 01:13:41,611
She was rude to her, but
she had to be, otherwise Edith

899
01:13:41,784 --> 01:13:45,448
would have moved in with her.
Tanny wanted her independence.

900
01:13:55,756 --> 01:13:58,999
Balanchine had encouraged Arthur to

901
01:13:59,177 --> 01:14:02,466
founding his own ballet
company, a black company.

902
01:14:02,638 --> 01:14:04,925
And Arthur found rooms in Harlem.

903
01:14:07,018 --> 01:14:10,807
Roman, if you do this again,
don't let your arms down.

904
01:14:10,980 --> 01:14:14,849
Hold her tight.  Remember,
you want it and you don't want it.

905
01:14:15,026 --> 01:14:16,983
We were in a restaurant.

906
01:14:17,153 --> 01:14:20,612
I sat at one table and she at another.

907
01:14:20,783 --> 01:14:25,072
I went up to her and said,
"Tanny, why don't you teach?

908
01:14:25,244 --> 01:14:28,657
You have all the knowledge
and you know all the tricks."

909
01:14:28,831 --> 01:14:30,787
She replied, "No, no, no!"

910
01:14:30,958 --> 01:14:35,122
"But you can, use your
wits!"  She said no again.

911
01:14:35,295 --> 01:14:37,255
Finally she asked for
time to think about it.

912
01:14:41,885 --> 01:14:45,970
I think she then spoke to
Balanchine and Jerry about it.

913
01:14:46,139 --> 01:14:51,761
I said to her, "Just try it."  From
then on she came regularly.

914
01:14:51,937 --> 01:14:56,558
She zipped around the
studio in her wheelchair.

915
01:14:56,733 --> 01:15:02,104
Mr. Balanchine gave her all the
exercises and dance steps to take with her.

916
01:15:04,158 --> 01:15:07,901
My two tutors, Lydia
Abarca and Virginia Johnson,

917
01:15:08,078 --> 01:15:11,116
learned everything they could from Tanny.

918
01:15:28,264 --> 01:15:31,554
Clearly, the person who
saved her was Arthur Mitchell.

919
01:15:31,726 --> 01:15:33,558
Balanchine would never have allowed

920
01:15:33,728 --> 01:15:36,048
her to <i>teach American
Ballet</i> in his <i>School Of</i>

921
01:15:36,189 --> 01:15:37,976
And she would have loved to do that.

922
01:15:38,150 --> 01:15:40,893
She would have been a
wonderful teacher for all classes.

923
01:15:41,069 --> 01:15:43,350
But he didn't even
want her near the school.

924
01:15:43,447 --> 01:15:45,029
He would have been embarrassed

925
01:15:45,198 --> 01:15:47,440
if she was in a wheelchair

926
01:15:47,617 --> 01:15:52,111
would have shown up at school.
Arthur Mitchell said:

927
01:15:52,289 --> 01:15:54,575
"We'll do it now! You teach with me.

928
01:15:54,748 --> 01:15:57,828
We'll get someone to pick you up.
Don't worry, we'll take care of you."

929
01:15:58,627 --> 01:16:02,871
Many dance teachers cannot
dance every step themselves

930
01:16:03,049 --> 01:16:04,914
and use their hands
for it.  They do like this:

931
01:16:05,092 --> 01:16:08,210
One, and two, and three, and four.

932
01:16:08,388 --> 01:16:10,174
They demonstrate with their hands how to

933
01:16:10,347 --> 01:16:14,432
perform the steps.  Tanny was very skilled.

934
01:16:14,603 --> 01:16:17,437
She performed movements
with one hand so quickly and

935
01:16:17,606 --> 01:16:20,769
gracefully that one would
think she was using both hands.

936
01:16:20,941 --> 01:16:23,604
She was so fast that you didn't even

937
01:16:23,778 --> 01:16:26,440
notice that one hand
wasn't working properly.

938
01:16:27,240 --> 01:16:30,231
She was tough.  She
said, "No, I want it that way!"

939
01:16:33,746 --> 01:16:36,613
She was reserved by nature.

940
01:16:36,790 --> 01:16:39,783
But certainly a bit spoiled by

941
01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:45,079
her looks, her skills, her intellect.

942
01:16:45,257 --> 01:16:47,965
And that didn't go away either.

943
01:16:49,011 --> 01:16:55,008
This familiarity was her salvation.
She got selfish.

944
01:16:55,184 --> 01:16:56,971
"I want to live!"

945
01:16:57,144 --> 01:17:01,013
It's self protection.  And she was tough!

946
01:17:01,273 --> 01:17:05,483
When you love someone,
you have to accept that.

947
01:17:07,446 --> 01:17:14,238
She was more mellow than short-tempered.
There were no questions and no accusations.

948
01:17:17,664 --> 01:17:22,500
As far as I can remember, there
has never been a specific incident.

949
01:17:22,670 --> 01:17:27,289
She never said Jerry
did or said this or that that

950
01:17:27,465 --> 01:17:32,677
upset her.  To my knowledge,
that never happened.

951
01:17:41,854 --> 01:17:48,771
To be honest I never understood why

952
01:17:48,945 --> 01:17:52,905
she didn't want to
spend more time with him.

953
01:17:53,448 --> 01:17:59,161
Tanny's relationship with Jerry
Robbins was both hot and cold.

954
01:17:59,330 --> 01:18:06,453
He drove her insane for
doing only what pleased him.

955
01:18:06,629 --> 01:18:09,747
Sometimes he was there
for her, sometimes not.

956
01:18:09,924 --> 01:18:12,337
I think she was fed up with

957
01:18:12,509 --> 01:18:14,923
him putting her on a pedestal

958
01:18:15,096 --> 01:18:17,046
and kept telling her how wonderful she was.

959
01:18:17,056 --> 01:18:19,297
She didn't really like
his ballets.  I hope she

960
01:18:19,475 --> 01:18:22,309
didn't tell him that too
many times.  The only ballets

961
01:18:22,478 --> 01:18:24,970
the ones she loved more
than anything were George's.

962
01:18:25,148 --> 01:18:29,562
He was the only person she
ever loved with all her heart.

963
01:18:30,152 --> 01:18:35,568
After Suzanne Farrell's marriage to Paul

964
01:18:35,741 --> 01:18:41,783
Mejia, I think George came to his senses.

965
01:18:41,955 --> 01:18:44,869
I don't know if you should send this...

966
01:18:45,042 --> 01:18:49,128
In any case, a different
life began for him now.

967
01:18:49,296 --> 01:18:53,040
And when that happened,
he started visiting Tanny.

968
01:18:53,217 --> 01:18:54,548
Especially in Weston.

969
01:18:54,718 --> 01:18:56,960
I remember he came into Weston once

970
01:18:57,137 --> 01:19:00,597
and cut all the lilacs down to about a foot

971
01:19:00,766 --> 01:19:02,052
and Tanny was angry.

972
01:19:47,729 --> 01:19:55,729
It took her a long time
to accept her illness.

973
01:19:56,320 --> 01:19:59,563
That acceptance was
coupled with deep, personal

974
01:19:59,740 --> 01:20:07,614
reflections on what was
truly important to her in life.

975
01:20:07,791 --> 01:20:12,626
And I think there was
also a spiritual dimension

976
01:20:12,795 --> 01:20:15,129
to the way she thought about something.

977
01:20:17,633 --> 01:20:19,841
Balanchine kept talking about it,

978
01:20:20,010 --> 01:20:23,470
calling himself a servant of God.

979
01:20:23,639 --> 01:20:26,928
As if he were a priest - which
in some ways he actually was.

980
01:20:27,101 --> 01:20:32,392
To some extent, that shaped
Tanny's feelings and thoughts as well.

981
01:20:35,567 --> 01:20:38,776
And in the last letter I got from Tanny,

982
01:20:38,945 --> 01:20:41,187
while George was in
the hospital, she wrote:

983
01:20:41,364 --> 01:20:43,732
"The nurse said he knows exactly how he is.

984
01:20:43,742 --> 01:20:46,029
He can speak, hear, feel.

985
01:20:46,203 --> 01:20:49,695
She handed him the
phone and I heard her say:

986
01:20:49,874 --> 01:20:54,539
'It's Tanny.'  I said hello and so did he.

987
01:20:54,712 --> 01:20:58,331
I said, 'I want to visit
you.'  And he said: 'Good.'

988
01:20:58,507 --> 01:21:03,878
Then I said, 'Goodbye, I love
you.'  And he said, 'I love you.'

989
01:21:04,054 --> 01:21:06,464
The last time I was
with him I talked a little

990
01:21:06,474 --> 01:21:08,636
and when he fell asleep
he was holding my hand.

991
01:21:10,059 --> 01:21:11,345
With love, Tanny."

992
01:21:13,646 --> 01:21:16,559
Although their marriage failed,

993
01:21:16,733 --> 01:21:19,692
the deep respect took hold

994
01:21:19,861 --> 01:21:27,861
for George Balanchine, crowned
by love for him, never fails at Tanny.

995
01:21:29,871 --> 01:21:32,909
In addition to being a husband,
ballet master and choreographer, he

996
01:21:33,083 --> 01:21:37,247
was the guiding light of her
thoughts and heart throughout her life.

997
01:22:17,668 --> 01:22:22,754
For years, many people,
including myself, have

998
01:22:22,924 --> 01:22:24,665
dreamed of her, and she
has always been able to walk.

999
01:22:25,592 --> 01:22:26,800
Always.

1000
01:23:01,253 --> 01:23:05,964
Doctors had told Balanchine
that Tanny wouldn't

1001
01:23:06,134 --> 01:23:09,968
live to be more than 40 or a little older.

1002
01:23:10,262 --> 01:23:14,802
But of course Tanny lived
much longer.  She turned 71.

1003
01:23:15,350 --> 01:23:17,807
That was due to the athletic training

1004
01:23:17,977 --> 01:23:19,844
of a dancer, to a tremendous will

1005
01:23:20,022 --> 01:23:22,014
and also a little bit
about her stubborn nature.

1006
01:23:22,607 --> 01:23:26,442
And those were the very
things Tanny had had since

1007
01:23:26,612 --> 01:23:29,901
she was 14, arms
crossed, telling Balanchine,

1008
01:23:30,073 --> 01:23:32,486
that she had been kicked out of class.

1009
01:23:38,790 --> 01:23:42,408
She had the gift of living in the moment.

1010
01:23:43,629 --> 01:23:45,790
Where did this gift come from?

1011
01:23:46,131 --> 01:23:50,295
Maybe from her parents, George Balanchine,

1012
01:23:50,467 --> 01:23:53,836
God, life in the locker
room and ballet school.

1013
01:23:54,180 --> 01:23:57,469
Everyone there lives at the
moment.  You know from the

1014
01:23:57,642 --> 01:24:01,181
start that nothing lasts
forever, nothing lasts long.

1015
01:24:04,482 --> 01:24:06,144
It's all very strange.

1016
01:24:06,317 --> 01:24:08,104
You start at a young age, then you

1017
01:24:08,278 --> 01:24:12,396
learn your techniques
and it's all downhill.

1018
01:24:12,573 --> 01:24:15,657
The <i>arabesque</i> doesn't work that
high anymore, your knees bend.

1019
01:24:15,826 --> 01:24:18,239
When you're over 30, you don't see things

1020
01:24:18,412 --> 01:24:20,529
the way you saw them when you were 24, 25.

1021
01:24:20,707 --> 01:24:23,995
Really not.  Some people can do it longer.

1022
01:24:24,168 --> 01:24:25,785
Some, of course, shorter.

1023
01:24:25,963 --> 01:24:29,500
But that's one of the
terrible things in life.

1024
01:24:29,673 --> 01:24:33,917
At some point you get to that
point and you come to terms with it.

1025
01:24:35,929 --> 01:24:43,645
I think she's come to terms
with it.  Like all dancers.

1026
01:24:44,646 --> 01:24:50,814
"I'm not a dancer anymore, who am I now?
I'm not a dancer, what am I?"

1027
01:25:32,110 --> 01:25:36,354
When she fell ill again towards the end of

1028
01:25:36,531 --> 01:25:39,990
her life, Jerry Robbins
tried his friendship

1029
01:25:40,160 --> 01:25:42,868
and to express love for her.

1030
01:25:43,039 --> 01:25:45,075
And she was grateful to him for that.

1031
01:26:14,193 --> 01:26:16,436
"I had a dream about Tanny.

1032
01:26:17,446 --> 01:26:18,904
I looked at her.

1033
01:26:19,491 --> 01:26:23,825
She radiated acceptance and forgiveness.

1034
01:26:24,412 --> 01:26:26,199
I said, 'Tanny!'

1035
01:26:26,497 --> 01:26:31,492
Then I walked over to her, put my arm
around her and kissed her on the lips.

1036
01:26:32,044 --> 01:26:37,711
She was young and old,
thin, sad, with clear eyes

1037
01:26:38,008 --> 01:26:40,295
and, oh, so cuddly.

1038
01:26:40,844 --> 01:26:45,885
I looked at her again and noticed that
other people were standing around us.

1039
01:26:46,058 --> 01:26:49,301
I kissed her again, passionately.

1040
01:26:49,478 --> 01:26:51,891
I was home."
