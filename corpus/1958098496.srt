1
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,658
- All right, well, that about does it.

2
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,548
- It's all good in here too, man.

3
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:33,478
- Awesome.

4
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,129
Hector, I wanna thank
you for your help, man.

5
00:00:35,131 --> 00:00:36,778
- Ah, of course.
- Appreciate you.

6
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:37,981
- Yeah.

7
00:00:37,983 --> 00:00:40,468
So you really think
you're gonna catch Bigfoot

8
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:41,338
in this thing?

9
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:42,655
- I know I will.

10
00:00:42,657 --> 00:00:45,058
Had about a dozen sightings out here.

11
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:46,263
- It's true, amigo.

12
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,306
I've seen him myself.

13
00:00:49,308 --> 00:00:50,141
- Oh yeah?

14
00:00:51,162 --> 00:00:53,191
Well, I think you guys are
getting high on your own supply.

15
00:00:55,950 --> 00:01:00,688
- Hector, why don't you
go obtener some cervezas

16
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:03,838
from el campamento before I kick your ass?

17
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,998
- You know, your Spanish
is getting really good.

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,283
- I pay attention.
- All right, adios.

19
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,593
Man, I don't like his shit talking.

20
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,632
- Only guy I could get
that'd work for dope.

21
00:01:18,634 --> 00:01:21,067
- I know, I know.

22
00:01:27,374 --> 00:01:29,583
You know, we did it.

23
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,780
- You wanted this for a long time.

24
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:36,120
Your pawpaw would be real proud of you.

25
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,943
Hey man, fuck Hector.

26
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:45,760
You thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?

27
00:01:45,762 --> 00:01:47,799
- Hell yeah.
- Hell yeah.

28
00:01:47,801 --> 00:01:48,718
- Let's go.

29
00:01:53,496 --> 00:01:54,329
- Ow.

30
00:01:55,206 --> 00:01:56,561
Bigfoot trap?

31
00:02:01,988 --> 00:02:02,821
Guys?

32
00:02:11,347 --> 00:02:12,237
Red?

33
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:15,116
Stop playing, man.

34
00:02:15,118 --> 00:02:17,804
I know that's you over there, bro.

35
00:02:17,806 --> 00:02:18,723
Fuck, okay.

36
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:01,798
- Hi, I'm Josh McMahon
with Point Zero Media,

37
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,118
and welcome to "The Point,"

38
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,843
a show where I interview
America's strangest citizens.

39
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:10,288
Obama killed Jeffrey Epstein?

40
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:11,188
- Yes.

41
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:13,108
- Waifu is a anime character

42
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:15,568
that you personally
adopt as your own wife.

43
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:17,248
- Mike Tyson, Muhammad Ali,

44
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:18,958
they come right out of this place.

45
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,428
They're looking at me
like, "What's up, dude?"

46
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:23,128
- Raising a dog is way more important

47
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:25,408
and more expensive than raising a human.

48
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:29,908
- My LLC prints these
waifus on body pillows.

49
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:30,988
- I was beating the shit.

50
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:35,038
I beat the shit out of Mike
Tyson, Muhammad Ali, same night!

51
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,468
- And you test these out yourself?

52
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:39,388
- Well, why wouldn't I?

53
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:40,378
- What are your...

54
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:42,448
- If you just do your own research

55
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:44,608
and look past all the lies.

56
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:48,238
- Grooming appointments,
nails, play dates, anal glands.

57
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,518
- I'm sorry, did you say anal glands?

58
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,838
- 37, 38, 39.

59
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,638
- Can you not count so fucking fast?

60
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,928
I'm trying.
- 40.

61
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:57,028
I'm counting to how many pushups you do.

62
00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:00,208
- Yeah, well, Tinkerbell has
a bit of a leakage issue.

63
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:01,648
- Nope, that's not even a pushup.

64
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:02,848
You gotta go all the way up.

65
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:04,468
- Why are you here,
are you from Argentina?

66
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:06,385
- I'm a journalist with Point Zero Media.

67
00:04:06,387 --> 00:04:07,218
- Oh, okay.

68
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:08,698
With the media, okay.

69
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:09,531
- I'm fucking like, I'm in this.

70
00:04:09,533 --> 00:04:11,098
This is my shit, yo.

71
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:14,278
- Hey, people have performance
issues all the time.

72
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,718
- Get, give me, get!
- Get off!

73
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,128
- I'm taking this interview!

74
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:19,828
- Because they don't want
us to know it's flat.

75
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:21,028
- And why not?

76
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:24,598
- Because they wanna control
how people perceive the world.

77
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,605
- They being the US government?

78
00:04:26,607 --> 00:04:27,898
- Every government

79
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:31,436
and every news organization
around the globe.

80
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:32,938
- Did you get that?

81
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:35,188
Around the globe?
- Yes.

82
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:37,533
- Don't you mean across the plate?

83
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,513
Let's wrap out.

84
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:44,061
Oh my God.

85
00:04:44,063 --> 00:04:47,071
- The Earth is flat, that is that!

86
00:04:47,073 --> 00:04:50,029
The Earth is flat, that is that!

87
00:04:56,949 --> 00:04:59,623
- Don't you mean across the plate?

88
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:01,978
- God, I can't believe people
like this actually exist.

89
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:03,335
- I can't believe they get to vote.

90
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:09,688
- Hey man, congrats.

91
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:11,338
4 million views in one weekend.

92
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:12,448
- Thanks, man.

93
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:14,338
Never actually had one
blow up like this before.

94
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:15,898
- Jake seemed to love it.

95
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,398
- Jake saw it?

96
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,300
- He sent it out to the whole company.

97
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,453
- Holy shit.

98
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:27,328
- Yeah, well, that's because we have

99
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:28,630
more lawyers than they do.

100
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:30,413
Yep.

101
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:32,998
Josh, right?
- Yeah.

102
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,308
- Congrats on the video.
- Thanks.

103
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:37,048
Gotta thank the Flat
Earth Lady for that too.

104
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:39,148
- God, she was hysterical.

105
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:41,788
And the way you kept egging her on and on.

106
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:43,858
- She was egging herself on.

107
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:46,108
- I showed the CEO and he loved it.

108
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:47,874
He wants to meet you.

109
00:05:47,876 --> 00:05:48,903
- For real?

110
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,808
- For real.

111
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:52,641
Now, check this out.

112
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:56,518
I found someone for your next video.

113
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,658
- Hi, my name's Red Wilson.

114
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:59,188
I'm the founder of the Southern Sasquatch

115
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:01,468
Research Foundation, and
I have created the world's

116
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:04,208
second freestanding Sasquatch Trap.

117
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:05,695
I've been searching for Sasquatch--

118
00:06:05,697 --> 00:06:06,838
- Oh, I like him already.

119
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:07,738
- Just wait.

120
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:08,938
- I've had a few sightings

121
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:10,975
of a medium-sized female in the area,

122
00:06:10,977 --> 00:06:12,508
and I intend on catching her.

123
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:14,518
I'm looking for an
accredited news organization

124
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,833
to come and cover this
incredible discovery.

125
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:20,218
It's been my pa...

126
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:22,768
- Amazing, I'll set up the interview.

127
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:24,272
- I don't want an interview.

128
00:06:24,274 --> 00:06:26,463
I want you to take him up on his offer.

129
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:30,838
- You want me to film
him catching Bigfoot?

130
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:34,798
- No, I want you to film
him not catching Bigfoot

131
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,750
and realizing he's a big fucking idiot.

132
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:39,598
- These people, they're not idiots.

133
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,968
They're just misinformed.

134
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:43,347
- To-may-to, to-ma-to.

135
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:46,228
The guy's just outside the Smoky Mountains

136
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:48,118
in East Tennessee.

137
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,223
That is for going viral.

138
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,068
- I don't know what to say.

139
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:57,333
- Nothing to say.

140
00:06:58,590 --> 00:06:59,673
Now go make another.

141
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:06,006
- So I'll go camping with him

142
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:08,733
and document his big discovery.

143
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:11,041
- Isn't that kind of mean?

144
00:07:11,043 --> 00:07:13,318
- He's the one that wanted the press.

145
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,868
- You know, he's gonna
make a fool of himself.

146
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:17,368
- No.

147
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:20,518
Maybe we find Bigfoot.

148
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,708
Look, I do interviews
like this all the time.

149
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:23,960
How's this any different?

150
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:28,408
- What about that autism
piece you were working on?

151
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:29,968
- Nobody wants to buy that.

152
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:31,408
- But it's important.

153
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:33,284
- These sites, they don't want important.

154
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,188
They want clicks.

155
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:36,478
- I just remember when you wanted

156
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,128
to do that kind of work.

157
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:41,133
- I still do, but I gotta start somewhere.

158
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:45,478
Before this, the show was
barely doing 100,000 an episode.

159
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,930
Now the CEO wants to meet me.

160
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:50,793
- I know, and I'm proud of you.

161
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,423
Just go easy on the guy, okay?

162
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:56,483
- Scouts honor.

163
00:08:33,031 --> 00:08:35,585
- All right, here we go.

164
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,008
- All right, I am here out
in Sweetwater, Tennessee,

165
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:54,328
just outside the Smoky Mountains,

166
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:57,988
and I'm about to meet Red
Wilson, who supposedly will

167
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:01,108
take me to make first
contact with Bigfoot.

168
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:01,941
Now, the way I see it,

169
00:09:01,943 --> 00:09:03,598
either one of two things is gonna happen.

170
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,118
Either, one, we find Bigfoot,

171
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:09,088
or, two, he makes a
complete ass of himself.

172
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:10,290
- Howdy, stranger.

173
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:13,138
- Hey, Josh McMahon, Point Zero Media.

174
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:15,706
- Red Wilson, Southern
Sasquatch Research Foundation.

175
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:17,848
Hope I didn't interrupt your filming none.

176
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:19,623
- No, just testing out the camera.

177
00:09:20,548 --> 00:09:21,841
- Right.

178
00:09:21,843 --> 00:09:23,500
All right, well, join
me when you're ready.

179
00:09:23,502 --> 00:09:24,523
- Yeah.

180
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,488
- Welcome to the SSRF headquarters.

181
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:37,073
This here's my best friend, Kyle.

182
00:09:44,967 --> 00:09:46,978
- You from Nashville?

183
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:49,558
- Not originally, moved there for work.

184
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,198
- Yeah, you and everyone fuckin' else.

185
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,608
- Kyle, be nice.

186
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:55,310
- Relax, I ain't gonna do nothin'.

187
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:58,288
- Nice tattoo.

188
00:09:58,290 --> 00:09:59,193
- Eh?

189
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,393
Resemblance is uncanny, huh?

190
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:08,253
May be the last thing Hector seen.

191
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,478
- Hector?

192
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,268
- Yeah, he's a friend of ours

193
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:13,948
that went missing a while back.

194
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:16,378
- Pretty sure a squatch got him.

195
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,638
- Pretty sure?

196
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,893
- He went back to camp
and we bailed on him.

197
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:24,118
Come back next day, camp's tore up.

198
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,348
He ain't there.

199
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:26,181
- Yeah, I spoke about it

200
00:10:26,183 --> 00:10:28,528
at a Bigfoot convention a while back.

201
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:29,625
You can look it up.

202
00:10:29,627 --> 00:10:32,368
- They got Bigfoot conventions?

203
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:33,808
- Yeah.

204
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:36,453
Actually, that's where I sell these.

205
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,480
- That pretty lucrative?

206
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:46,438
- Nah, not really, but
I make enough to get by.

207
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,968
Plus I get a speaking fee.

208
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:49,738
- Oh hell, I ain't get paid shit.

209
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:50,818
- Sounds like finding Bigfoot

210
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,570
is in your best financial interest.

211
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:56,908
- It ain't about making money, man.

212
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:59,013
It's about proving that Sasquatch is real.

213
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:02,428
Plus, I'm sick of folks making fun of us.

214
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:03,743
- Yeah.

215
00:11:03,745 --> 00:11:05,853
If he wanted money, he'd sell drugs.

216
00:11:09,273 --> 00:11:10,573
- You know, I googled you.

217
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:12,863
- Yeah?

218
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:15,178
- Yeah, I really liked that article

219
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:17,613
you did on art therapy for veterans.

220
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:21,628
- Oh yeah, I did that in school.

221
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:22,463
- Yeah?

222
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:25,288
My daddy was a vet.

223
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:27,028
He would have liked it.

224
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:28,588
- I'm honored.

225
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:30,268
Yeah, I wish I did more stuff like that.

226
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:32,068
- Well, man, now here's your chance.

227
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:33,570
We got a hell of a story here.

228
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,060
I'm glad you're on it with me.

229
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:40,169
Here.

230
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,938
Dear Lord Jesus, we pray
that we be straightforward

231
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,443
like the sky-reaching tree,

232
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:53,832
that our souls be clear like spring water,

233
00:11:53,834 --> 00:11:56,553
and that you be our constant
companion on this trip,

234
00:11:57,570 --> 00:11:59,620
and that the squatches be ever plentiful.

235
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:02,098
Amen.

236
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:02,933
- Amen.

237
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:05,213
- Woo!

238
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,210
All right, buddy, let's go!

239
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,218
- So what got you
into all this stuff anyway?

240
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:31,018
- Squatching?
- Yeah.

241
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:32,338
- Oh, my pawpaw.

242
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:34,198
He and I used to be obsessed
with this documentary

243
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,878
called "The Bigfoot Tape."

244
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,528
Used to take me squatching all the time,

245
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:40,078
which was really just fun camping trips.

246
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:42,058
It was a way of escaping.

247
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:44,248
You know, home life was rough.

248
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:47,098
Well, that Bigfoot tape
turned out to be a hoax.

249
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,628
- You know, a lot of people
watching are gonna think

250
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:50,308
what you're doing is a hoax.

251
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:51,778
- But see, I got proof.

252
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:53,938
- So many years, you think
we'd already have proof.

253
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,458
I mean, where's all the evidence?

254
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:59,338
We don't even know where
Bigfoot lives or sleeps.

255
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:00,363
- You really asking?

256
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:05,788
Bigfoot sleeps in burrows,
kind of like big holes, dens.

257
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:09,598
I've never seen one myself,
but much like God himself,

258
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,718
just 'cause you don't see him,
don't mean he ain't there.

259
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,287
- I'm a journalist.

260
00:13:14,289 --> 00:13:16,139
I can't believe it without seeing it.

261
00:13:17,034 --> 00:13:19,184
- Well, I guess hell's
full of journalists.

262
00:13:20,026 --> 00:13:23,608
- Touche, Red.

263
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:24,443
Touche.

264
00:13:47,937 --> 00:13:49,318
- Whoa.

265
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,033
What's, what's that for?

266
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:54,538
- Shooting bait, scaring
bears, protection.

267
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:55,648
You want one?

268
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:57,903
- No, I'm not really
comfortable around guns.

269
00:13:59,040 --> 00:13:59,871
- To be honest, we're a little

270
00:13:59,873 --> 00:14:01,858
too comfortable with guns around here.

271
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,260
Don't tell Kyle I said that.

272
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:06,933
All right, let's go.

273
00:14:30,229 --> 00:14:32,603
Did you catch that on tape?

274
00:14:32,605 --> 00:14:34,323
- Nah, I missed it.

275
00:14:35,498 --> 00:14:37,148
- Then you missed something rare.

276
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,958
They're hardly out during the day.

277
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,218
- That was Bigfoot?

278
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:42,478
- Sure was.

279
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,353
They use knocks to communicate
their location to each other.

280
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:50,393
- You sure it wasn't a squirrel
telling a knock, knock joke?

281
00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:56,483
- Good one.

282
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:09,478
Welcome to the only Sasquatch trap

283
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,133
south of the Mason-Dixon line.

284
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:17,663
I brought a bunch of bait up this morning.

285
00:15:22,218 --> 00:15:24,325
- I always thought
Bigfoot lived in the PNW.

286
00:15:24,327 --> 00:15:26,938
- You keep talking like there's only one.

287
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,228
It's a whole species.

288
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:30,358
Australia, they got Yowies.

289
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,918
Nepal, they got Yetis.

290
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,774
And here, we got Sasquatch.

291
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:42,268
This here's a trip wire.

292
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:43,989
That way when she comes to get the bait...

293
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:50,635
She keeps eating bait out of here,

294
00:15:50,637 --> 00:15:53,133
but I only had the trip
wire put in last week.

295
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:56,191
- How do you know it was her?

296
00:15:57,330 --> 00:15:58,163
- Check it out.

297
00:16:01,728 --> 00:16:02,828
It's pretty cool, huh?

298
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:16,430
- Wow, that's...

299
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:19,348
- It's convincing.

300
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:21,713
I don't know why you need
any more proof than that.

301
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,318
- Thanks for setting up the tents.

302
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,302
- Oh man, no sweat.

303
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:33,573
You know, I figure we got
about two days to catch her.

304
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:38,090
- What if we don't?

305
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:40,858
- Well, then you'll bully me like you did

306
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:42,093
that Flat Earth Lady.

307
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:46,438
- All right, about that video so--

308
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,990
- Hey man, look, I know
you wouldn't do that to me.

309
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:53,073
I told you I googled you.

310
00:17:06,117 --> 00:17:09,693
All right, we need to stay quiet.

311
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:13,940
- What are you doing?

312
00:17:13,942 --> 00:17:17,230
Are you playing it a lullaby?

313
00:17:22,113 --> 00:17:23,280
- Shh, listen.

314
00:17:33,974 --> 00:17:37,224
That's her.

315
00:17:39,595 --> 00:17:44,595
- Kind of sounds like a,
like a hillbilly mating call.

316
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,408
- Turn the camera off.

317
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:50,241
- Wait, I thought you wanted me to...

318
00:17:50,243 --> 00:17:51,178
Dude, what are you doing?

319
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:52,338
Give me the fucking--
- Shh!

320
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:53,883
Why did you come here?

321
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:56,540
- Man, my boss sent me here.

322
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:58,613
- To do what?

323
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:01,198
- To take you up on your offer.

324
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,873
- Then take me up on my offer, man.

325
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:07,510
All right, you're a journalist,
not a goddamn comedian.

326
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:17,553
All right, you do it.

327
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:22,353
I want you to show the world
that I ain't playing tricks.

328
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:24,593
Right?

329
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:48,187
She's this way here, come on.

330
00:18:48,189 --> 00:18:50,522
Let's go, let's go, come on.

331
00:19:00,936 --> 00:19:03,061
That's her, man.

332
00:19:03,063 --> 00:19:06,328
Look at that, one, two, three, four, five.

333
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:07,288
You see that?

334
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:09,416
- That actually kinda looks fresh.

335
00:19:09,418 --> 00:19:11,160
- Hell yeah, it does.

336
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:14,933
- Someone must have
planted it though, right?

337
00:19:15,986 --> 00:19:16,817
- What the heck?

338
00:19:16,819 --> 00:19:17,758
What do you mean someone planted it?

339
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,876
Look at this, there's
no way that someone...

340
00:19:28,279 --> 00:19:29,188
Oh, shit, man.

341
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:31,108
We gotta go.
- What was that?

342
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:32,458
- Sometimes they fell trees.

343
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:35,038
It's a scare tactic when
they get territorial.

344
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,028
We gotta go now.

345
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:37,258
- Are we in any danger?

346
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,598
- We're not in danger,
but we need to stay quiet,

347
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,018
and we need to get back to camp now.

348
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:42,145
- Okay, let me
just finish getting this.

349
00:19:42,147 --> 00:19:42,978
- No, no, come on.

350
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:43,811
We gotta now, right now.

351
00:19:43,813 --> 00:19:45,027
Come on, let's go.

352
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:59,068
- All right, day two.

353
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:00,898
I checked the trap before Red woke up.

354
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,388
To make sure he didn't mess with it.

355
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:04,440
It's all still there.

356
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:06,933
Trip wire was still set.

357
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:11,703
I leave tomorrow morning,
so today's gonna be big.

358
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:18,118
There was definitely something
out there last night,

359
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:21,917
but someone must have
planted the print, right?

360
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:26,608
- Hey, I'm gonna go shoot some fresh bait.

361
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:27,568
You all good here?

362
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:29,763
- Yeah, just working on the video.

363
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:32,638
- Right?

364
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,128
While I'm gone, can you clean the trap?

365
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:38,158
- She didn't take any of the bait?

366
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,348
- I think we scared her off last night.

367
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:43,168
- Hey, about last night, I...

368
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:46,513
- Quite the show, wasn't it?

369
00:20:55,248 --> 00:20:57,928
- What's up, big man?
- Yo.

370
00:20:57,930 --> 00:20:59,068
- You get some good footage?

371
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:01,021
- Yep, but he ain't buying it.

372
00:21:01,023 --> 00:21:02,823
- That don't surprise me.
- Yeah.

373
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:05,758
- Well, what you thinking?

374
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,468
- Let's hold off.

375
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:09,838
No, I'll give you a call if
we don't catch anything good

376
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,368
on tape by tonight.

377
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:12,328
- All right, fair enough.

378
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:13,776
- Yeah.

379
00:21:13,778 --> 00:21:14,611
- I thought, that ought to work.

380
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,029
- God bless.

381
00:21:20,031 --> 00:21:21,718
Man, I couldn't shoot shit this morning.

382
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,368
- Hey, you always been
a shit shot, ain't you?

383
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:24,478
- Shut up.

384
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,253
- And on the house.

385
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:29,818
- Man, I told you I don't do that no more.

386
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:32,668
- You gonna need the confidence
if you gonna be on TV.

387
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:34,108
- Get rid of it.

388
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:35,993
God knows you don't need any more of it.

389
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:37,673
- Fine.

390
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:40,070
Happy squatching.

391
00:21:52,013 --> 00:21:52,846
Come on.

392
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:19,678
- Hey baby, how's the trip?

393
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:22,108
- Well, I just cleaned a
whole bunch of rotten fruit

394
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:23,946
from a Bigfoot trap, so.

395
00:22:23,948 --> 00:22:26,016
- Say no more.

396
00:22:26,018 --> 00:22:27,618
What's he like?

397
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:29,287
- You know, I actually
think he kind of believes

398
00:22:29,289 --> 00:22:30,483
in all this stuff.

399
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:33,296
You know, I'm supposed
to make this video funny,

400
00:22:33,298 --> 00:22:36,243
but I think I'm starting to feel bad.

401
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:40,056
- Well, maybe you should
change your approach.

402
00:22:40,058 --> 00:22:41,998
- Yeah, but you know,

403
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,848
Tiggs is actually counting
on something funny, so.

404
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:47,758
- Babe, remember it's just a video.

405
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,593
- Right, yeah.

406
00:22:50,206 --> 00:22:54,128
We just, we really need this, you know?

407
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:57,178
- I know, I'm
proud of you, really.

408
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:58,653
- Steph?
- Great story.

409
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:02,578
Josh?
- Hey, I'm losing you, okay?

410
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:03,411
- Josh?

411
00:23:03,413 --> 00:23:04,470
- I'll be home tomorrow.

412
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:22,678
That's a lot of meat.

413
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,088
- Ah, yeah, Kyle brought it.

414
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:25,290
I couldn't kill nothing.

415
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,678
- Shouldn't you put that at the trap?

416
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,088
- I figure we'd leave
a trail of breadcrumbs

417
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:31,623
up to the trap for her.

418
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,158
- Through our campsite?

419
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:38,308
Isn't that kind of dangerous?

420
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:40,973
- Well, not if Bigfoot ain't
real, it ain't dangerous.

421
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:44,260
- All right, look, I...

422
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,495
I'm sorry if I've been rude, I just....

423
00:23:46,497 --> 00:23:49,318
- No, hey, look, listen,
don't worry about it.

424
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,788
I understand.

425
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:52,966
You're the journalist
and I'm the Bigfoot nut.

426
00:23:52,968 --> 00:23:54,538
- Ah, look, I wouldn't
say that, I'm just--

427
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:57,658
- Look man, you're getting
a squatch on camera tonight,

428
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:59,098
no matter what.

429
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,030
I promise.

430
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:17,019
Man, thanks for coming out.

431
00:24:17,021 --> 00:24:19,018
I needed a break from that city boy.

432
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:20,098
- Yeah.

433
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:22,103
- Why can't you just
stay out here with us?

434
00:24:22,958 --> 00:24:24,578
- He smells like Nashville.

435
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:26,253
- That's true.

436
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:30,418
Man, I saw him putting
cologne on in the woods.

437
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:31,353
- How about that?

438
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:35,453
- Man, I don't know
what I'd do without you.

439
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:39,957
- You'd be all right.

440
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:45,153
- All right, another night.

441
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:48,467
I've been debating a lot with myself

442
00:24:48,469 --> 00:24:51,783
about what I'm doing here
and how to approach this.

443
00:24:53,670 --> 00:24:56,070
Got me thinking a lot
about the Flat Earth Lady.

444
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:02,253
Come to think about it, I,
I don't even know her name.

445
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:14,333
Shit.

446
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:16,803
I need more water.

447
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:22,020
Fuck was that?

448
00:25:35,126 --> 00:25:36,126
Who's there?

449
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:56,910
- You're safe to come out now.

450
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:03,061
- Did you kill it?

451
00:27:03,063 --> 00:27:04,918
- Nah, man, she
wasn't being aggressive.

452
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,688
I just scared her off.

453
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:09,208
- There was a Sasquatch right
here and you didn't shoot it.

454
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:11,248
- They're sacred animals.

455
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:13,627
I ain't gonna hurt one
that's not trying to hurt me.

456
00:27:13,629 --> 00:27:14,878
- The body of a fuckin' Sasquatch

457
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,768
would've changed the world!

458
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:18,238
- So you believe it?

459
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,071
- Believe what?

460
00:27:19,073 --> 00:27:21,183
- That what you just saw was a Sasquatch.

461
00:27:23,268 --> 00:27:25,183
- I, I mean, I don't know.

462
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:27,088
It could have been a black bear.

463
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:28,138
- A black?

464
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:30,028
Jesus, there ain't no
winning with you people.

465
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:32,253
- Look, bears are common in this area.

466
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:35,008
- Well, did you at least get it on video?

467
00:27:35,010 --> 00:27:38,008
- A little, but it's dark and blurry.

468
00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:39,238
- All right.

469
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,818
You had an encounter with
something you don't understand.

470
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:44,188
So go back to bed, watch the video.

471
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:46,290
I guaran-damn-tee you that wasn't no bear.

472
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:49,353
- Wow, unbelievable.

473
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:08,488
Smells like a sewer in here.

474
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:10,408
- Yeah, that's common.

475
00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:13,288
They call 'em skunk apes down in Florida.

476
00:28:13,290 --> 00:28:15,490
Looks like she stepped
clean over that wire.

477
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:19,018
- So it ate all the bait,
stepped over the wire.

478
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:20,488
Just kept walking?

479
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:22,258
It's kind of convenient.

480
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:24,028
- What else could it be?

481
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:27,238
Ain't no black bear big
enough to step over that wire.

482
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,140
- How do you know?

483
00:28:36,597 --> 00:28:38,432
- There she is.

484
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:42,423
- So what now?

485
00:28:44,670 --> 00:28:45,808
- Nothin'.

486
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:48,748
I mean, you've had as close
an encounter as I've ever had.

487
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:50,038
And didn't you get that
footage last night?

488
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,298
I mean, between that and the thermal--

489
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:52,858
- Mine's blurry.

490
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:55,138
It still looks like a
bear on its hind legs.

491
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:56,758
- Looks like a?

492
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,108
You fucking kidding me?

493
00:28:58,110 --> 00:28:59,188
What about the thermal?

494
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:02,068
- Dude, how do I know it
wasn't some guy in a costume?

495
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:02,903
Or you?

496
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:10,773
- Fine, pack your things.

497
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,400
I'm gonna go clean the trap.

498
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:22,323
He thought it was a bear,
a goddamn black bear.

499
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,048
- That's a tall fuckin' bear.

500
00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:25,883
- Mm-hmm.

501
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:28,671
Yeah, he ain't gonna believe it

502
00:29:28,673 --> 00:29:30,508
until he shakes hands with the damn thing.

503
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:32,853
God.
- I can make that happen.

504
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:34,798
- Good.

505
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,555
I figure, be down there
in about 15 minutes.

506
00:29:37,557 --> 00:29:38,390
- All right.

507
00:29:39,330 --> 00:29:41,158
Got any special requests?

508
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,610
Want me to do a little dance?

509
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:46,868
- Be serious, man, he's
gonna have you on camera.

510
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:49,108
- You think he's gonna buy it?

511
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:50,860
- Man, we don't got another choice.

512
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,028
- I mean, you can let him go.

513
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:55,138
- Man, I don't want him mocking me

514
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:57,088
in front of the whole world.

515
00:29:57,090 --> 00:29:58,431
- All right, all right.

516
00:29:58,433 --> 00:29:59,403
I'll do it.

517
00:30:00,786 --> 00:30:01,738
- All right.

518
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:04,253
Keep your shit together.
- I'm good, I got my shit.

519
00:30:06,198 --> 00:30:07,198
Got my shit.

520
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:15,893
Shit, yeah.

521
00:30:16,949 --> 00:30:18,282
Oh, that's good.

522
00:30:19,529 --> 00:30:20,862
Shit, yeah, man.

523
00:30:24,237 --> 00:30:25,845
- You ready?

524
00:30:25,847 --> 00:30:26,793
- Yeah.

525
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:33,453
Hey, sorry for how everything turned out.

526
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:37,983
- Yeah, well, I can't force
you to believe something.

527
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:41,033
- I can tell this means
a lot to you though.

528
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:42,743
- Yeah.

529
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:45,628
Well, it was dumb to think that I could

530
00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:47,223
trap a squatch in two days.

531
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,533
- Look, people can decide
for themselves, all right?

532
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,960
I'll be honest in the video.

533
00:30:56,670 --> 00:30:57,670
- I'm sure you will.

534
00:31:01,290 --> 00:31:04,198
- Hey, you got any extra water?

535
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,508
Ran out.

536
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:07,410
- Get your camera.

537
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,398
- What are you seeing?

538
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,683
- Look, look, it's her.

539
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:21,190
- Is that a bear?

540
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:23,093
- That's her.

541
00:31:30,090 --> 00:31:31,618
- I thought you said they
didn't come out during the day.

542
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:33,388
- I said it was rare.

543
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:36,783
All right, stay very
still, or she might charge.

544
00:31:47,838 --> 00:31:49,581
- We should run.

545
00:31:49,583 --> 00:31:51,843
- No, no, no, just keep filming.

546
00:31:59,795 --> 00:32:01,988
- We need to run.

547
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:03,153
- We're fine.

548
00:32:04,530 --> 00:32:06,423
Keep the camera steady.

549
00:32:12,783 --> 00:32:14,133
- Maybe she doesn't see us.

550
00:32:22,992 --> 00:32:25,625
- No!

551
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,713
Shit, Kyle.

552
00:32:30,835 --> 00:32:32,398
- Kyle.

553
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,838
Oh, shit.

554
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,269
- Oh, God, fuck.

555
00:32:35,271 --> 00:32:36,268
What the hell, man?

556
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:37,566
I told you to stay back!

557
00:32:37,568 --> 00:32:39,965
- I was fuckin' around.

558
00:32:39,967 --> 00:32:42,769
I didn't think he'd
really buy it.

559
00:32:42,771 --> 00:32:44,770
- You shot him, what the hell?

560
00:32:52,546 --> 00:32:54,213
- Wait, wait.

561
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,215
- You mother fucker, you shot him!

562
00:32:57,217 --> 00:32:58,501
- Don't do something
you're gonna regret, okay?

563
00:32:58,503 --> 00:32:59,555
- You fuckin' shot him!

564
00:32:59,557 --> 00:33:00,533
- Don't do anything, please don't!

565
00:33:00,535 --> 00:33:01,515
- Goddamn it!
- Don't do it!

566
00:33:01,517 --> 00:33:03,794
Please, please, don't do it,
don't do it, don't shoot!

567
00:33:27,743 --> 00:33:29,608
- Oh my God, Kyle, man.

568
00:33:29,610 --> 00:33:30,478
Are you coked out?

569
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:33,538
- I needed this for my confidence.

570
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:35,465
I was gonna be on TV.

571
00:33:35,467 --> 00:33:39,086
- Man, I told
you not to fuck this up.

572
00:33:39,088 --> 00:33:40,263
What were you doing?

573
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,547
- This shit costume.

574
00:33:43,549 --> 00:33:46,318
I just wanted to scare him, Red.

575
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,728
- It is a shit costume, man.

576
00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:48,813
You look like shit.

577
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,778
Man, come on, we gotta get you up.

578
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:53,158
Come on, come on.

579
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,328
We gotta get you to the car.

580
00:33:54,330 --> 00:33:55,161
Come on.

581
00:33:55,163 --> 00:33:55,996
We gotta fix this.

582
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:04,443
- Hey, Red!

583
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:06,988
- Just gotta get to the car.

584
00:34:06,990 --> 00:34:07,821
- Yep.
- All right?

585
00:34:07,823 --> 00:34:09,392
- Yep.
- We're gonna make it.

586
00:34:09,394 --> 00:34:10,225
- Yep.

587
00:34:10,227 --> 00:34:11,488
- All right, just, the car's right there.

588
00:34:11,490 --> 00:34:13,190
- Yeah, I see it.
- Come on, man.

589
00:34:14,771 --> 00:34:18,208
- Red, let me out!

590
00:34:18,210 --> 00:34:19,653
It was an accident!

591
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:23,444
- We're gonna make it, don't you worry.

592
00:34:23,446 --> 00:34:24,598
All right, just get in the truck.

593
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:25,561
- Yeah.
- Come on.

594
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:26,398
All the way, all the way.

595
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,763
Come on, let's do it.

596
00:34:27,765 --> 00:34:30,063
Come on, come on.

597
00:34:32,224 --> 00:34:33,261
All right, I got you.

598
00:34:33,263 --> 00:34:34,471
We're gonna make it, man.

599
00:34:34,473 --> 00:34:36,182
We're gonna make it.

600
00:34:36,184 --> 00:34:37,604
Man, you with me, Kyle?

601
00:34:37,606 --> 00:34:39,089
Okay, all right, come on, Kyle.

602
00:34:39,091 --> 00:34:41,779
- Red.
- What is it, man, what?

603
00:34:41,781 --> 00:34:44,281
- You a good friend, Red.

604
00:34:44,283 --> 00:34:45,145
- You're a good friend.

605
00:34:45,147 --> 00:34:46,717
You're the best friend in the world, man.

606
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:48,188
We're gonna make it, okay?

607
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:49,403
Come on.

608
00:34:49,405 --> 00:34:51,282
Oh God, come on, truck.

609
00:34:51,284 --> 00:34:52,117
Kyle?

610
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:53,953
Kyle?

611
00:34:55,415 --> 00:34:57,015
Kyle!

612
00:34:57,017 --> 00:34:57,850
God.

613
00:35:01,366 --> 00:35:03,476
Come on, wake up, man.

614
00:35:03,478 --> 00:35:04,311
Wake up.

615
00:35:07,289 --> 00:35:08,634
Come on, man.

616
00:35:08,636 --> 00:35:09,870
You're not dying on me.

617
00:35:09,872 --> 00:35:10,703
Come on.

618
00:35:10,705 --> 00:35:12,833
Man, you with me?

619
00:35:13,752 --> 00:35:17,171
Come on, Kyle, Kyle, you with me?

620
00:35:17,173 --> 00:35:19,172
No, don't do this!

621
00:35:19,174 --> 00:35:20,760
Don't, no, don't!

622
00:35:20,762 --> 00:35:23,345
Oh God, oh please, God, please!

623
00:35:40,244 --> 00:35:41,077
- Oh, no.

624
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:23,480
Red, there you are.

625
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,103
Whoa, take, take it easy.

626
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:35,993
- He's dead.

627
00:36:40,906 --> 00:36:43,388
- I'm so sorry.
- Put your fuckin' hands up!

628
00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:46,005
- It was an accident, okay?

629
00:36:46,007 --> 00:36:47,768
- You meant to shoot him.

630
00:36:47,770 --> 00:36:50,437
- I didn't know it was a person.

631
00:36:53,563 --> 00:36:55,146
Please don't shoot.

632
00:36:57,389 --> 00:36:59,056
- An eye for an eye.

633
00:37:00,553 --> 00:37:03,126
Ain't that what they say?

634
00:37:03,128 --> 00:37:04,878
- Please don't shoot.

635
00:37:20,310 --> 00:37:21,273
- This is bad.

636
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:27,248
- Please, just let me out.

637
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:28,678
- I can't do that.

638
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:31,228
I let you go, and you'll
tell everyone I'm a psycho.

639
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:32,930
I locked you up and kidnapped you.

640
00:37:34,383 --> 00:37:37,678
It'll kill the SSRF, which
is my only source of income.

641
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,508
And you'll get away with
the murder of my only friend

642
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:41,060
on the grounds of self-defense.

643
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:45,420
I'll get thrown in jail for kidnapping.

644
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:47,830
I'll become a laughing stock.

645
00:37:51,166 --> 00:37:53,016
- I'll do whatever you want me to do.

646
00:37:53,910 --> 00:37:56,063
- You're only saying
that 'cause I got a gun.

647
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:58,721
- They're not gonna let
me go on self-defense

648
00:37:58,723 --> 00:38:00,663
because I thought I saw Bigfoot.

649
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:03,418
Believe me, all right?

650
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:05,893
I don't want anyone else
to know about this either.

651
00:38:05,895 --> 00:38:07,888
- I don't know what I was thinking.

652
00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:09,778
- I swear on my life, all right?

653
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:11,680
Let me out, I'm not gonna tell a soul.

654
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:15,880
- Well, let's say you're being honest.

655
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:19,048
How can I trust you?

656
00:38:19,050 --> 00:38:22,233
Will I just believe that you're
gonna keep quiet forever?

657
00:38:23,730 --> 00:38:24,958
And the longer I keep you in there,

658
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,210
the more trouble I get
into legally speaking,

659
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:30,280
especially after that whole Hector thing.

660
00:38:36,450 --> 00:38:38,248
All right, let's figure this out.

661
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:40,378
How are we gonna get out of this?

662
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:42,838
- People will realize I'm missing.

663
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,008
They know where I am.

664
00:38:44,010 --> 00:38:46,108
- They know where my cabin is.

665
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:47,968
I managed to keep the
location of the trap a secret,

666
00:38:47,970 --> 00:38:49,708
even during the Hector investigation.

667
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:51,028
- They'll send a search party.

668
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:53,480
- You'll die of thirst
before they ever find you.

669
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:59,493
I don't want to kill you, but
I might just let God do it.

670
00:39:02,610 --> 00:39:03,443
- Okay.

671
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,993
Variables aside,

672
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:11,739
what's the perfect
outcome look like for you?

673
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:19,318
- Well, ideally we
would've caught a squatch.

674
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,908
Second place being that,

675
00:39:20,910 --> 00:39:23,043
assuming Kyle's shit costume fooled you,

676
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:26,308
you'd have gone back
with some decent video.

677
00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:30,238
You convince enough people,
I could sell more shirts,

678
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:31,288
could have built more traps,

679
00:39:31,290 --> 00:39:33,568
and then eventually caught the real thing.

680
00:39:33,570 --> 00:39:36,268
Maybe even have you back
out here to film it.

681
00:39:36,270 --> 00:39:37,103
- Okay.

682
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,138
But with your friend gone and--

683
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:40,973
- Kyle.

684
00:39:44,451 --> 00:39:47,240
- With Kyle gone and me in this trap,

685
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:50,193
what's your ideal scenario?

686
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:00,333
- There ain't no ideal scenario.

687
00:40:01,170 --> 00:40:03,208
- I'll tell you mine, all right?

688
00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:04,648
You let me out of here.

689
00:40:04,650 --> 00:40:06,058
We contact Kyle's family.

690
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:07,468
- Kyle was a junkie and a dealer

691
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:09,273
with no family or friends except me.

692
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:12,208
He wasn't like Hector.

693
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:14,753
Hector had a wife who went
looking for him immediately.

694
00:40:16,290 --> 00:40:19,040
Only people gonna notice
Kyle's gone are other junkies.

695
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,528
We ain't gotta tell no one.

696
00:40:22,530 --> 00:40:24,988
- Great, let's avoid the hassle.

697
00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:26,578
I'm telling you, they're not
gonna let me off the hook

698
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:29,229
because I thought I saw Bigfoot.

699
00:40:29,231 --> 00:40:30,423
- Wait a minute, proof.

700
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,783
We got proof of you shooting Kyle.

701
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:38,908
You could take the footage
you have and make a movie

702
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:41,758
out of it like the one that
pawpaw and I used to watch.

703
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:42,591
And I could let you go,

704
00:40:42,593 --> 00:40:44,883
and I won't tell the
cops that you shot Kyle.

705
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:46,918
And then you can take that footage

706
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:49,798
and make it look like
a convincing encounter.

707
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:50,633
Win-win.

708
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:54,780
And as for the proof of me locking you up.

709
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,543
Well, we ain't got proof of that, do we?

710
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:07,888
- Deal.

711
00:41:07,890 --> 00:41:10,353
Bring me my backpack, I'll edit the video.

712
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:30,423
- Well, that's about
as good a deal as any.

713
00:41:32,310 --> 00:41:33,143
I'll be back.

714
00:42:40,155 --> 00:42:41,655
- Oh, shit.

715
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:43,913
- Hey.

716
00:42:45,535 --> 00:42:46,948
Is this what you're looking for?

717
00:42:46,950 --> 00:42:47,783
- Perfect.

718
00:42:49,170 --> 00:42:51,658
- Found the video of you shooting Kyle.

719
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:52,828
Deleted it off the memory card

720
00:42:52,830 --> 00:42:54,380
and put it on this flash drive.

721
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:57,478
When you're done with the video,

722
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:59,780
we'll put it on here and
destroy the computer.

723
00:43:00,792 --> 00:43:01,953
So don't try anything.

724
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:07,040
- Where are you going?

725
00:43:10,230 --> 00:43:11,073
- To a funeral.

726
00:43:31,710 --> 00:43:33,960
- This morning something
went horribly wrong.

727
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:37,500
A man is dead.

728
00:43:45,027 --> 00:43:47,493
And now Red Wilson is holding me hostage.

729
00:44:42,570 --> 00:44:43,618
- Who would've thought the squatch

730
00:44:43,620 --> 00:44:47,286
would've killed you before
dealing did?

731
00:44:47,288 --> 00:44:48,121
You dummy.

732
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:02,403
You know, you know
growing up was real tough,

733
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:06,243
especially after pawpaw died
and Daddy hit rock bottom.

734
00:45:09,210 --> 00:45:11,188
But man, you made it better.

735
00:45:11,190 --> 00:45:12,023
You...

736
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:15,693
Hey, sure you had your issues.

737
00:45:17,130 --> 00:45:18,813
But I didn't mind.

738
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:24,923
You were the only one
that would listen to me.

739
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:27,573
You were all I had, man.

740
00:45:28,961 --> 00:45:31,653
You can't be dead.

741
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:40,113
I love you, bud.

742
00:45:41,130 --> 00:45:42,123
God's got you now.

743
00:45:45,797 --> 00:45:48,547
And bye.

744
00:46:10,748 --> 00:46:11,581
- Signal.

745
00:46:15,797 --> 00:46:17,419
Signal.

746
00:46:17,421 --> 00:46:18,504
Fuck, signal.

747
00:46:19,445 --> 00:46:21,167
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

748
00:46:21,169 --> 00:46:22,586
Come on, come on.

749
00:46:29,417 --> 00:46:30,844
Come on, come on.

750
00:46:30,846 --> 00:46:32,770
Signal, come on.

751
00:46:32,772 --> 00:46:34,925
He's gonna be fuckin' back.

752
00:46:34,927 --> 00:46:37,258
Come on, come on, give
me a fuckin' signal.

753
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:39,153
Come on, come on, come on.

754
00:46:41,190 --> 00:46:42,358
Yes.

755
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:44,370
Yes, okay.

756
00:46:53,670 --> 00:46:54,988
- 911, what's your emergency?

757
00:46:54,990 --> 00:46:56,218
- I don't have much time.

758
00:46:56,220 --> 00:46:57,358
My name is Josh McMahon,

759
00:46:57,360 --> 00:47:00,020
and I'm being held hostage by Red Wilson.

760
00:47:08,340 --> 00:47:09,958
We parked a black Ford pickup truck next

761
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:13,018
to some trailers on a
gravel road in Sweetwater.

762
00:47:13,020 --> 00:47:16,228
And from there, we hiked down
a dirt path into the woods.

763
00:47:16,230 --> 00:47:18,923
And I'm being locked in when
he calls the Bigfoot trap.

764
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:21,233
Hello?

765
00:47:22,331 --> 00:47:23,193
Hello?

766
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:28,048
- You know, I used to smoke
cigarettes all the time.

767
00:47:28,050 --> 00:47:30,275
Now I can't hardly finish one without.

768
00:47:33,270 --> 00:47:35,488
What the fuck are you doing?

769
00:47:35,490 --> 00:47:36,838
- There's no signal, I was just--

770
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:37,671
- Hand it over.

771
00:47:37,673 --> 00:47:40,550
- I wasn't doing anything.
- Give me the phone right now!

772
00:48:00,346 --> 00:48:02,548
It's exactly what I'm
fucking talking about!

773
00:48:02,550 --> 00:48:04,228
The minute you don't
have a gun in your face,

774
00:48:04,230 --> 00:48:05,638
you go back on our deal!

775
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:07,653
- Red, I wasn't doing anything, okay?

776
00:48:08,550 --> 00:48:09,868
- Don't you lie to me.

777
00:48:09,870 --> 00:48:11,315
Did you or did you not call the cops?

778
00:48:11,317 --> 00:48:12,298
- How could I?

779
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:14,181
There's no signal.

780
00:48:47,610 --> 00:48:49,531
- Well, this changes things, don't it?

781
00:48:49,533 --> 00:48:50,673
- It doesn't have to.

782
00:48:57,360 --> 00:48:59,338
Red, nothing's changed, okay?

783
00:48:59,340 --> 00:49:01,381
I can still edit the video.

784
00:49:01,383 --> 00:49:02,833
You can watch me send it off.

785
00:49:04,110 --> 00:49:05,313
- You call the cops.

786
00:49:06,286 --> 00:49:08,728
You don't care if they find
out that you shot Kyle?

787
00:49:08,730 --> 00:49:11,398
- No, I was just trying
to call my girlfriend.

788
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:13,048
I was gonna let her know
I was gonna be home late.

789
00:49:13,050 --> 00:49:13,883
- Bullshit.

790
00:49:17,070 --> 00:49:19,920
- I also filmed a goodbye
video in case I didn't make it.

791
00:49:23,340 --> 00:49:24,243
- Edit the video.

792
00:49:25,890 --> 00:49:28,163
I'll let you know what I
decide when you're done.

793
00:49:54,990 --> 00:49:56,178
- So, what,
did you find the guy?

794
00:49:56,180 --> 00:49:58,113
- Yeah, I got the black pickup truck.

795
00:49:59,670 --> 00:50:01,048
Look, I'm pretty far out here.

796
00:50:01,050 --> 00:50:03,328
I think I'm gonna need some backup.

797
00:50:03,330 --> 00:50:04,408
- Hey man,
you're cutting out.

798
00:50:04,410 --> 00:50:06,685
You have your satellite phone?

799
00:50:06,687 --> 00:50:08,788
- No, my sat phone's dead.

800
00:50:08,790 --> 00:50:09,940
I'm never this far out.

801
00:50:14,726 --> 00:50:17,390
Hey, look, I'm gonna go scope
it out and check on the guy.

802
00:50:17,392 --> 00:50:18,225
Out.

803
00:50:21,990 --> 00:50:24,238
- What I saw that night was unexplainable.

804
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:27,093
I came out here expecting a
hoax, but I left a believer.

805
00:50:30,510 --> 00:50:31,410
What do you think?

806
00:50:35,713 --> 00:50:36,713
- I don't know, man.

807
00:50:40,025 --> 00:50:42,175
I mean, I've been
squatching my whole life.

808
00:50:43,530 --> 00:50:48,063
The one time that I try to
fake something, this happens.

809
00:50:50,610 --> 00:50:51,993
And now Kyle's gone.

810
00:50:53,670 --> 00:50:55,195
Pawpaw's gone.

811
00:50:58,380 --> 00:50:59,213
Daddy's gone.

812
00:51:01,110 --> 00:51:03,254
And I know the moment
I let you out of there,

813
00:51:03,256 --> 00:51:04,888
you're gonna go make a fool of me

814
00:51:04,890 --> 00:51:05,998
just like everyone else does.

815
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:06,833
- Hey, come on.

816
00:51:07,710 --> 00:51:08,665
We're gonna figure this out.

817
00:51:08,667 --> 00:51:10,143
- No, man, can't you see?

818
00:51:12,660 --> 00:51:14,758
This is all I got, all right?

819
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:16,563
I can't lose this too.

820
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:26,788
- Oh, what are you doing, man?

821
00:51:26,790 --> 00:51:28,708
- Man, I gotta, I gotta stop crying.

822
00:51:28,710 --> 00:51:29,818
I gotta think straight, man.

823
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:30,928
I need, I need a clear head.

824
00:51:30,930 --> 00:51:33,697
- That's not gonna
help you think straight.

825
00:51:33,699 --> 00:51:35,548
Red, stop!

826
00:51:35,550 --> 00:51:36,383
- Woo!

827
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:39,628
Okay, all right.

828
00:51:39,630 --> 00:51:40,713
Woo, okay.

829
00:51:41,580 --> 00:51:43,738
Man, I gotta go think straight.

830
00:51:43,740 --> 00:51:44,571
I'll be back.

831
00:51:44,573 --> 00:51:46,138
- Red, wait, come on!

832
00:51:46,140 --> 00:51:47,938
Red, stop!
- I'll be back.

833
00:51:47,940 --> 00:51:48,771
Woo!

834
00:51:48,773 --> 00:51:51,080
We're gonna figure out a
way out of this thing, man.

835
00:51:52,823 --> 00:51:53,656
Okay.

836
00:51:55,730 --> 00:51:56,563
- Fuck.

837
00:52:19,359 --> 00:52:20,942
- You fucking liar.

838
00:52:23,717 --> 00:52:24,550
Okay.

839
00:52:27,271 --> 00:52:30,726
Okay.

840
00:52:30,728 --> 00:52:32,194
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
slow down, slow down.

841
00:52:32,196 --> 00:52:33,808
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, slow
down, slow down, slow down.

842
00:52:33,810 --> 00:52:35,638
- Thank God you're here, officer.

843
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:36,478
You gotta help me, man.

844
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:37,311
He's after me.

845
00:52:37,313 --> 00:52:38,428
- Who's after you?
- He's got a gun.

846
00:52:38,430 --> 00:52:39,261
We gotta go.

847
00:52:39,263 --> 00:52:40,288
Come on.
- Hey, hey, take it easy.

848
00:52:40,290 --> 00:52:43,198
Take a breath, look,
you're safe now, all right?

849
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:45,028
Now, what's your name?

850
00:52:45,030 --> 00:52:46,722
- My name's Josh McMahon.

851
00:52:46,724 --> 00:52:49,798
I'm with Point Zero
Media out of Nashville.

852
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:52,569
- Okay, and who'd you
say held you hostage?

853
00:52:52,571 --> 00:52:55,438
- His name's Kyle Baker, all right?

854
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:56,428
You gotta help me, man.

855
00:52:56,430 --> 00:52:57,391
- Okay, where is he now, Kyle?

856
00:52:57,393 --> 00:52:59,128
Hey, look at me, look at me, look at me.

857
00:52:59,130 --> 00:53:00,628
Where is Kyle now?
- Man, I don't know.

858
00:53:00,630 --> 00:53:01,461
He could be watching us, man.

859
00:53:01,463 --> 00:53:03,211
We gotta go.
- What about Red Wilson?

860
00:53:03,213 --> 00:53:05,163
We got a report about Red Wilson.

861
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:08,638
- Oh man, he, he, he,
he left this morning.

862
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:10,918
I don't know, he could
be dead for all I know.

863
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:12,720
- I need you to take me to the trap.

864
00:53:14,146 --> 00:53:15,268
- What?
- The trap.

865
00:53:15,270 --> 00:53:16,228
We got a report about a trap

866
00:53:16,230 --> 00:53:17,338
where you were being held hostage.

867
00:53:17,340 --> 00:53:18,268
I need you to take me there.

868
00:53:18,270 --> 00:53:19,708
- But I don't understand, I escaped.

869
00:53:19,710 --> 00:53:20,570
We should just...

870
00:53:22,230 --> 00:53:24,148
What are you doing, man?

871
00:53:24,150 --> 00:53:25,198
- I know who you are.

872
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:27,388
- I told you, I'm Josh.
- You're Red Wilson!

873
00:53:27,390 --> 00:53:29,608
I remember you from the
Hector Ramirez case.

874
00:53:29,610 --> 00:53:32,038
Now, put your hands where I can see 'em.

875
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:32,871
Now, take me to the trap.

876
00:53:32,873 --> 00:53:34,863
Hey, hands where I can see 'em!

877
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:43,403
- You know, man, I was just on
the other side of this thing.

878
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:46,050
- Hey, Red, don't do
something you're gonna regret.

879
00:53:46,052 --> 00:53:47,268
- I won't.

880
00:53:47,270 --> 00:53:50,398
- Hey, you're gonna take
me to the trap, all right?

881
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:51,508
And you're not gonna put up a fight,

882
00:53:51,510 --> 00:53:53,608
and you'll be in way less
trouble, you understand?

883
00:53:53,610 --> 00:53:56,225
We'll go, I'll take you.
- All right.

884
00:53:56,227 --> 00:53:58,803
You know, man, I really
do appreciate what you do.

885
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:00,838
- That's great.

886
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:02,048
- I'm sorry you had--
- Let's go.

887
00:54:02,050 --> 00:54:03,050
- Okay.
- Let's go.

888
00:54:16,110 --> 00:54:17,190
- Officer, in here.

889
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:21,058
- Is there anyone else out here?

890
00:54:21,060 --> 00:54:22,078
- No, sir.

891
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:23,578
It's just us.

892
00:54:23,580 --> 00:54:24,688
- What's your name?

893
00:54:24,690 --> 00:54:25,563
- Josh McMahon.

894
00:54:26,940 --> 00:54:28,408
I made the 911 call.

895
00:54:28,410 --> 00:54:29,968
- You fuckin' liar!

896
00:54:29,970 --> 00:54:31,463
- All right, down on your knees.

897
00:54:34,494 --> 00:54:36,183
Get down on your knees, now!

898
00:54:37,260 --> 00:54:38,093
Now!

899
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:42,030
- Use the keys on his
hip to unlock the trap.

900
00:54:45,570 --> 00:54:47,428
- Goddamn it, I need backup.

901
00:54:47,430 --> 00:54:49,558
- You can get a cell signal if
you climb on top of the trap.

902
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:51,478
- Okay, gotcha, thank you.

903
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:53,130
Don't you move, I will shoot you.

904
00:55:47,457 --> 00:55:48,420
- Officer, look out!

905
00:56:10,143 --> 00:56:10,976
Oh, God.

906
00:56:14,427 --> 00:56:15,260
Damn it.

907
00:56:25,316 --> 00:56:27,719
All right, you got me pretty good.

908
00:56:27,721 --> 00:56:28,721
But not good enough.

909
00:56:51,272 --> 00:56:52,105
Aw, fuck.

910
00:56:55,697 --> 00:56:56,614
Okay, okay.

911
00:57:02,130 --> 00:57:02,963
Okay.

912
00:57:04,770 --> 00:57:06,088
I'm gonna put him in there with you, okay?

913
00:57:06,090 --> 00:57:08,278
So just step back.

914
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:09,111
- What?

915
00:57:09,113 --> 00:57:10,613
- I'm gonna put him in there with you.

916
00:57:11,700 --> 00:57:12,600
Where are my keys?

917
00:57:15,810 --> 00:57:16,710
Where are my keys?

918
00:57:18,180 --> 00:57:19,013
Officer.

919
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:21,393
Hey, officer.

920
00:57:22,650 --> 00:57:25,198
Officer, hey, wake up.

921
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:26,031
Hey, man.

922
00:57:26,033 --> 00:57:26,864
Hey, wake up.

923
00:57:26,866 --> 00:57:28,168
Hey, wake up.

924
00:57:28,170 --> 00:57:30,508
Hey, hey.

925
00:57:30,510 --> 00:57:32,188
Hey, wake up, officer.

926
00:57:32,190 --> 00:57:33,023
Hey!

927
00:57:34,170 --> 00:57:35,769
Hey.

928
00:57:46,470 --> 00:57:47,303
- What is it?

929
00:57:50,370 --> 00:57:51,779
- Oh my God.

930
00:57:51,781 --> 00:57:52,948
- What?

931
00:57:53,913 --> 00:57:54,753
- He's dead.

932
00:57:56,044 --> 00:57:57,358
- What?
- I don't know, man.

933
00:57:57,360 --> 00:57:58,768
I don't, I don't know what happened.

934
00:57:58,770 --> 00:58:00,268
I just kicked him, I
wasn't trying to kill him.

935
00:58:00,270 --> 00:58:01,114
I don't know if he had a heart attack

936
00:58:01,116 --> 00:58:02,818
or a fuckin' aneurysm or--

937
00:58:02,820 --> 00:58:03,651
- How do you know?

938
00:58:03,653 --> 00:58:05,128
Check his pulse.

939
00:58:05,130 --> 00:58:05,961
- I did, man.

940
00:58:05,963 --> 00:58:06,794
I checked his pulse.

941
00:58:06,796 --> 00:58:08,458
I kicked, I just kicked
him, that's all I did.

942
00:58:08,460 --> 00:58:10,993
I wasn't trying to kill him.

943
00:58:12,930 --> 00:58:14,733
- Red, we gotta call somebody.

944
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:17,476
- No, man.

945
00:58:17,478 --> 00:58:18,684
No, I can't.

946
00:58:18,686 --> 00:58:19,863
I gotta...

947
00:58:19,865 --> 00:58:24,865
I gotta do something about it.

948
00:58:34,464 --> 00:58:35,680
Okay.

949
00:58:35,682 --> 00:58:37,531
Okay, all right.

950
00:58:49,552 --> 00:58:51,100
Oh my God.

951
00:58:51,102 --> 00:58:53,061
Oh, you've done it now, Red.

952
00:58:53,063 --> 00:58:55,146
You killed a fuckin' cop.

953
00:58:56,337 --> 00:58:59,143
Oh my God, what am I gonna do?

954
00:59:01,339 --> 00:59:02,643
Oh my God.

955
00:59:02,645 --> 00:59:04,443
Fuckin' goddamn it, hey!

956
00:59:54,937 --> 00:59:55,770
Josh.

957
01:00:08,185 --> 01:00:09,018
Ah, shit.

958
01:00:14,196 --> 01:00:15,029
Josh!

959
01:00:16,930 --> 01:00:19,013
I can't hear you running.

960
01:00:19,979 --> 01:00:21,812
So you must be hiding.

961
01:00:23,314 --> 01:00:25,397
And I know these woods.

962
01:00:25,399 --> 01:00:28,899
There's only a couple places you could be.

963
01:00:33,888 --> 01:00:36,478
Maybe we could come to an agreement.

964
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:38,098
Get some blood on your hands.

965
01:00:38,100 --> 01:00:39,243
We get rid of the cop.

966
01:00:40,770 --> 01:00:42,183
We go our separate ways.

967
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:44,883
You got your leverage back.

968
01:00:48,420 --> 01:00:49,593
There you are.

969
01:00:57,090 --> 01:00:58,494
Shit!

970
01:01:06,470 --> 01:01:07,731
- Oh, shit.

971
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:16,455
- Last one's for you, Kyle.

972
01:01:30,646 --> 01:01:32,054
- Fuck!

973
01:01:32,056 --> 01:01:33,702
Goddamn it!

974
01:01:33,704 --> 01:01:34,873
- Gotcha.

975
01:01:34,875 --> 01:01:37,173
- Ah, fuck!

976
01:01:37,175 --> 01:01:39,306
- Don't you fuckin' move!
- You fuckin' shot me!

977
01:01:39,308 --> 01:01:41,218
- That's right, pussy.

978
01:01:41,220 --> 01:01:42,051
Where are my keys?

979
01:01:42,053 --> 01:01:43,953
Keys, where are my fuckin' keys?

980
01:01:47,150 --> 01:01:50,272
- Fuck!

981
01:01:50,274 --> 01:01:51,688
- You know, you sure do change your tune

982
01:01:51,690 --> 01:01:52,738
when there's a gun in your face.

983
01:01:52,740 --> 01:01:54,358
- I'll do whatever you want, all right?

984
01:01:54,360 --> 01:01:56,177
Just fuck, don't shoot me.

985
01:01:56,179 --> 01:01:57,418
Fuck!

986
01:01:57,420 --> 01:02:00,208
Don't fucking shoot me, goddamn it!

987
01:02:00,210 --> 01:02:01,505
Fuck!

988
01:02:01,507 --> 01:02:03,813
- All right, get up, I got a plan.

989
01:02:04,860 --> 01:02:05,691
Come on, get up!

990
01:02:05,693 --> 01:02:07,768
- That's right, it's fucked!

991
01:02:07,770 --> 01:02:08,670
- Come on, get up!

992
01:02:12,738 --> 01:02:13,569
What the fuck are you doing?

993
01:02:13,571 --> 01:02:14,585
You wanna die?

994
01:02:14,587 --> 01:02:15,958
Do you wanna fuckin' die?

995
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:16,978
Come on, move!

996
01:02:16,980 --> 01:02:18,418
Let's go!

997
01:02:18,420 --> 01:02:19,253
Move it!

998
01:02:30,414 --> 01:02:31,618
- They're gonna be a little suspicious

999
01:02:31,620 --> 01:02:33,298
when the body's covered in dirt.

1000
01:02:33,300 --> 01:02:35,700
- We'll clean him up real
good, just keep going.

1001
01:02:41,873 --> 01:02:43,708
- Red, can I just have some--

1002
01:02:43,710 --> 01:02:44,728
- You'll get water when you're done.

1003
01:02:44,730 --> 01:02:46,198
Just keep going.

1004
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:47,068
- I'm gonna pass out.

1005
01:02:47,070 --> 01:02:48,778
I haven't had any water since yesterday.

1006
01:02:48,780 --> 01:02:50,488
- You're gonna be fine!

1007
01:02:50,490 --> 01:02:51,543
Now keep going!

1008
01:02:56,370 --> 01:02:57,520
You know I ain't lying.

1009
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:01,150
There really is a squatch out here.

1010
01:03:04,031 --> 01:03:05,338
- Then why fake it?

1011
01:03:05,340 --> 01:03:07,613
- Because I don't wanna
be made a laughing stock.

1012
01:03:09,131 --> 01:03:10,593
I wanna make my pawpaw proud.

1013
01:03:12,030 --> 01:03:14,033
Now, come on, get him out of this costume.

1014
01:03:15,390 --> 01:03:16,290
Come on, hurry up!

1015
01:03:22,986 --> 01:03:25,378
You know, you're not a bad guy, Josh.

1016
01:03:25,380 --> 01:03:27,180
Why are you doing stories like this?

1017
01:03:29,670 --> 01:03:31,320
- We all gotta make money, right?

1018
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:33,898
- Come on.

1019
01:03:33,900 --> 01:03:35,283
I make a living off these.

1020
01:03:37,380 --> 01:03:38,548
Why don't you try answering that again?

1021
01:03:38,550 --> 01:03:41,100
What's a guy like you doing
bullying regular folks?

1022
01:03:43,260 --> 01:03:45,808
- Honestly, man, I fell into it, okay?

1023
01:03:45,810 --> 01:03:47,038
I had an assignment to interview

1024
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:48,573
these right wing protestors.

1025
01:03:49,980 --> 01:03:51,330
Story ended up being funny.

1026
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:54,500
Next thing you know, I got a show.

1027
01:03:55,740 --> 01:03:56,883
Girlfriend moves in.

1028
01:04:00,390 --> 01:04:02,823
I wanted to make my
way up as a journalist.

1029
01:04:04,320 --> 01:04:05,670
I never saw it as bullying.

1030
01:04:07,560 --> 01:04:09,010
- Well, that's not up to you.

1031
01:04:10,485 --> 01:04:12,653
Now, come on, let's get
him back up to camp.

1032
01:04:18,704 --> 01:04:20,248
Oh, come on, stop your moping.

1033
01:04:20,250 --> 01:04:21,081
Come on.

1034
01:04:21,083 --> 01:04:23,398
- Dude, he's heavy and he reeks, okay?

1035
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:25,850
- Then maybe you shouldn't
have fuckin' shot him!

1036
01:04:27,056 --> 01:04:27,889
Now move!

1037
01:04:37,650 --> 01:04:39,688
Cop and a drug dealer
get into an altercation

1038
01:04:39,690 --> 01:04:40,690
and kill each other.

1039
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:42,473
How sad.

1040
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:44,613
Happens all the time.

1041
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:48,238
- How do you explain the 911 call?

1042
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:50,378
- Ah, we'll just tell him that you,

1043
01:04:50,380 --> 01:04:53,458
you were forced to blame me
at gunpoint or something.

1044
01:04:53,460 --> 01:04:54,838
Come on, let's move.

1045
01:04:54,840 --> 01:04:56,283
Let's move, come on.

1046
01:04:58,320 --> 01:04:59,613
Come on, let's go.

1047
01:05:01,740 --> 01:05:03,190
All right, go get the laptop.

1048
01:05:24,851 --> 01:05:26,748
- Red, stop.

1049
01:05:26,750 --> 01:05:27,868
Red, quit.
- No, come on.

1050
01:05:27,870 --> 01:05:29,842
Go in.

1051
01:05:31,410 --> 01:05:32,690
- Thought we had a deal.

1052
01:05:36,330 --> 01:05:38,698
Come on, man, I'm here to help.

1053
01:05:38,700 --> 01:05:41,458
- Well, the dynamics changed again.

1054
01:05:41,460 --> 01:05:42,560
I found another shell.

1055
01:05:45,129 --> 01:05:46,323
- That gun was empty?

1056
01:05:47,160 --> 01:05:48,560
- Beautiful thing, ain't it?

1057
01:06:05,190 --> 01:06:08,313
Shooting Kyle will be the
last thing you're known for.

1058
01:06:10,170 --> 01:06:11,520
I'm gonna tell you a story.

1059
01:06:12,360 --> 01:06:15,448
Don't worry, you'll like this story.

1060
01:06:15,450 --> 01:06:16,600
It's got a good ending.

1061
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:21,508
Six hours before my pawpaw
died of a heart attack,

1062
01:06:21,510 --> 01:06:25,258
he made me a Bigfoot T-shirt
with his own two hands.

1063
01:06:25,260 --> 01:06:27,418
Not too different from
the one I'm wearing now.

1064
01:06:27,420 --> 01:06:30,395
It was a pink and blue
tie-dye shirt with the words,

1065
01:06:30,397 --> 01:06:32,425
"I believe" written across it,

1066
01:06:32,427 --> 01:06:34,827
and the Patterson-Gimlin
Bigfoot right below it.

1067
01:06:38,040 --> 01:06:41,608
Well, sure enough, his
heart gave out that evening,

1068
01:06:41,610 --> 01:06:45,363
and suddenly that shirt became
my most prized possession.

1069
01:06:46,800 --> 01:06:48,988
My daddy didn't care for it much.

1070
01:06:48,990 --> 01:06:53,403
He come home one night, all
fucked up, screaming at me.

1071
01:06:54,277 --> 01:06:55,325
"Take that thing off.

1072
01:06:55,327 --> 01:06:57,237
"You look like a goddamn hippie!"

1073
01:06:59,250 --> 01:07:00,093
I told him no.

1074
01:07:03,070 --> 01:07:05,458
And he ripped that shirt off my back.

1075
01:07:05,460 --> 01:07:07,865
Smacked me across the back of the head.

1076
01:07:07,867 --> 01:07:09,815
"Your pawpaw's dead.

1077
01:07:09,817 --> 01:07:11,877
"I want you to drop the Bigfoot thing."

1078
01:07:12,900 --> 01:07:14,336
I fished the T-shirt out of the trash

1079
01:07:14,338 --> 01:07:16,528
and hid it in my backpack.

1080
01:07:16,530 --> 01:07:18,123
Wore it to school the next day.

1081
01:07:19,980 --> 01:07:22,348
Half as a fuck you to my daddy,

1082
01:07:22,350 --> 01:07:24,550
and half as a way to
keep my pawpaw with me.

1083
01:07:27,107 --> 01:07:29,608
When I got to school, the
kids started bullying me,

1084
01:07:29,610 --> 01:07:32,698
which wasn't unusual,
but it got a lot worse

1085
01:07:32,700 --> 01:07:34,443
on account of that shirt.

1086
01:07:36,060 --> 01:07:39,093
They started calling me Bigfoot faggot.

1087
01:07:41,820 --> 01:07:43,233
I hate that word now.

1088
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:44,993
Faggot.

1089
01:07:46,440 --> 01:07:49,900
They started bashing my face
against a water fountain

1090
01:07:50,763 --> 01:07:54,363
and kicking the shit
out of me and all that.

1091
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:57,190
And then I met this kid named Kyle,

1092
01:07:58,412 --> 01:08:00,723
the one you so graciously shot and killed.

1093
01:08:03,150 --> 01:08:04,948
Kyle was gay for real.

1094
01:08:04,950 --> 01:08:06,500
They all called him faggot too.

1095
01:08:08,121 --> 01:08:10,408
You gotta remember, this
was the South in '04

1096
01:08:10,410 --> 01:08:13,323
so that kind of thing didn't fly.

1097
01:08:15,840 --> 01:08:18,238
Kyle and I became inseparable,

1098
01:08:18,240 --> 01:08:20,090
which didn't help my reputation none.

1099
01:08:21,660 --> 01:08:24,010
Kyle told me he was gonna
help me find Bigfoot.

1100
01:08:26,755 --> 01:08:29,883
That we would make everyone
who ever doubted us sorry.

1101
01:08:31,350 --> 01:08:32,673
He believed in me, man.

1102
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:38,883
Man, with Kyle gone and my
squatching career in danger,

1103
01:08:41,190 --> 01:08:42,023
I don't know.

1104
01:08:44,310 --> 01:08:46,710
The whole situation's
just gotten too fucked up.

1105
01:08:49,620 --> 01:08:53,463
All I know is they're gonna
find you dead in that cage.

1106
01:08:55,672 --> 01:09:00,672
And they're gonna find this
with you shooting Kyle on it.

1107
01:09:07,407 --> 01:09:09,074
And as for me, well.

1108
01:09:17,270 --> 01:09:18,103
Red.

1109
01:09:19,194 --> 01:09:20,027
Red!

1110
01:09:21,076 --> 01:09:21,909
Red!

1111
01:09:22,890 --> 01:09:23,823
Red, wake up.

1112
01:09:25,050 --> 01:09:26,043
Stop playing, Red.

1113
01:09:29,310 --> 01:09:31,736
Stop playing, stop playing, Red.

1114
01:09:31,738 --> 01:09:35,751
Wake up.

1115
01:09:35,753 --> 01:09:36,586
Red, fuck.

1116
01:09:42,257 --> 01:09:43,174
Oh, please.

1117
01:09:58,555 --> 01:09:59,388
Help!

1118
01:10:01,565 --> 01:10:02,398
Somebody!

1119
01:10:10,343 --> 01:10:11,176
Hello!

1120
01:10:12,799 --> 01:10:13,632
Somebody!

1121
01:10:18,336 --> 01:10:19,169
Help.

1122
01:10:20,490 --> 01:10:21,740
Somebody, help.

1123
01:10:25,670 --> 01:10:26,503
Help.

1124
01:10:27,895 --> 01:10:28,728
Help.

1125
01:10:45,343 --> 01:10:46,176
Water.

1126
01:10:54,235 --> 01:10:57,608
Water.

1127
01:11:18,386 --> 01:11:19,219
Man, fuck.

1128
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:26,593
Oh, fuck!

1129
01:11:34,296 --> 01:11:35,129
Come on.

1130
01:11:40,076 --> 01:11:41,422
Fuck!

1131
01:11:42,737 --> 01:11:43,654
Goddamn it!

1132
01:12:05,478 --> 01:12:06,311
Red?

1133
01:12:08,714 --> 01:12:09,964
Where'd you go?

1134
01:12:43,461 --> 01:12:44,628
What the hell?

1135
01:12:45,991 --> 01:12:46,874
What the?

1136
01:12:53,660 --> 01:12:54,532
Kyle?

1137
01:13:25,693 --> 01:13:26,526
Oh shit.

1138
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:04,048
These past three days were an intense,

1139
01:18:04,050 --> 01:18:05,998
traumatic experience.

1140
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:07,558
I know you probably
won't believe the story

1141
01:18:07,560 --> 01:18:10,203
I've just shared with you, but it's true.

1142
01:18:11,162 --> 01:18:11,995
Oh, Red.

1143
01:18:14,280 --> 01:18:16,915
My phone was smashed,
my laptop was smashed,

1144
01:18:16,917 --> 01:18:19,198
and my memory cards were wiped.

1145
01:18:19,200 --> 01:18:21,268
I got a few clips back
from a data recovery team,

1146
01:18:21,270 --> 01:18:22,370
but most of it's gone.

1147
01:18:23,250 --> 01:18:25,768
This includes my encounter
with the Sasquatch,

1148
01:18:25,770 --> 01:18:28,170
something I don't expect
most people to believe.

1149
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:32,943
Red Wilson went through
a lot in his short life.

1150
01:18:34,140 --> 01:18:38,723
But finding Bigfoot gave him
purpose, gave him meaning.

1151
01:18:40,260 --> 01:18:43,533
After my time with him, I can
honestly say I believe him.

1152
01:18:44,400 --> 01:18:45,300
What do you think?

1153
01:18:50,786 --> 01:18:52,858
- I didn't laugh once.

1154
01:18:52,860 --> 01:18:53,691
- I just thought that--

1155
01:18:53,693 --> 01:18:55,738
- Ah, ah, ah, ah.

1156
01:18:55,740 --> 01:18:58,558
Don't you have any footage
from the first couple of days?

1157
01:18:58,560 --> 01:19:01,858
You know, before all that shit went down?

1158
01:19:01,860 --> 01:19:02,733
Something funny?

1159
01:19:04,050 --> 01:19:05,308
- I was almost killed.

1160
01:19:05,310 --> 01:19:07,648
- Which sucks, but I was wondering

1161
01:19:07,650 --> 01:19:12,268
if we didn't have
something more clickable.

1162
01:19:12,270 --> 01:19:13,103
- Clickable?

1163
01:19:14,340 --> 01:19:17,218
I had an encounter with
an actual Sasquatch.

1164
01:19:17,220 --> 01:19:18,273
- Allegedly.

1165
01:19:19,140 --> 01:19:21,778
- What the hell do you
think beat me up so bad?

1166
01:19:21,780 --> 01:19:24,268
- Do you know how crazy you sound?

1167
01:19:24,270 --> 01:19:26,548
We're a news site, not a tabloid.

1168
01:19:26,550 --> 01:19:27,718
- You don't believe me?

1169
01:19:27,720 --> 01:19:28,588
- Well, duh.

1170
01:19:28,590 --> 01:19:30,508
You don't have any footage of the thing.

1171
01:19:30,510 --> 01:19:31,978
- Look, just upload it, okay?

1172
01:19:31,980 --> 01:19:34,713
If the video bombs, you
can fire me on the spot.

1173
01:19:37,200 --> 01:19:40,233
- If it bombs, do I still
have to pay you for the video?

1174
01:19:41,460 --> 01:19:42,856
- No.

1175
01:19:42,858 --> 01:19:43,773
- Deal.

1176
01:19:44,610 --> 01:19:47,433
500,000 views and you can keep your job.

1177
01:19:50,460 --> 01:19:52,160
- Maybe he won't fire you.

1178
01:19:53,480 --> 01:19:56,373
- 50,000 views in one weekend's
considered a huge flop.

1179
01:19:57,330 --> 01:19:59,943
- So, what now?

1180
01:20:01,110 --> 01:20:03,010
- We can't afford for me to get fired.

1181
01:20:05,880 --> 01:20:07,473
- Maybe this is a good thing.

1182
01:20:09,750 --> 01:20:10,583
- Maybe.

1183
01:20:13,080 --> 01:20:14,775
God, everyone who saw that video

1184
01:20:14,777 --> 01:20:16,953
probably thinks I'm crazy.

1185
01:20:17,820 --> 01:20:20,163
- It was a pretty crazy story.

1186
01:20:22,440 --> 01:20:23,840
- You believe me, don't you?

1187
01:20:25,170 --> 01:20:26,420
- Of course I do.

1188
01:20:27,480 --> 01:20:29,133
- You believe I saw Sasquatch?

1189
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:35,073
- I believe you saw something
and that it attacked you.

1190
01:20:36,300 --> 01:20:37,708
- So, no?

1191
01:20:37,710 --> 01:20:39,298
- Look, you went through a lot of trauma.

1192
01:20:39,300 --> 01:20:40,798
I mean, who knows what you saw?

1193
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:41,800
- I know what I saw.

1194
01:20:47,700 --> 01:20:49,292
- I'm surprised Tiggs has
given you another chance.

1195
01:20:50,280 --> 01:20:51,783
- Yeah, for two free videos.

1196
01:20:53,966 --> 01:20:56,948
- The Earth's
flat and that's that!

1197
01:20:56,950 --> 01:20:58,888
- Ready for part two?

1198
01:20:58,890 --> 01:21:00,002
- Don't really have another choice.

1199
01:21:00,004 --> 01:21:01,299
- And that's that!

1200
01:21:01,301 --> 01:21:04,187
The Earth's flat and that's that!

1201
01:21:04,189 --> 01:21:06,188
The Earth's flat and that's that!

1202
01:21:06,190 --> 01:21:07,023
- Coming?

1203
01:21:09,567 --> 01:21:10,400
- I can't.

1204
01:21:11,964 --> 01:21:12,797
- What?

1205
01:21:14,190 --> 01:21:15,856
- I can't do it.

1206
01:21:17,070 --> 01:21:18,003
- Are you serious?

1207
01:21:18,900 --> 01:21:20,938
Dude, Tiggs will fire you.

1208
01:21:20,940 --> 01:21:21,890
- Then he fires me.

1209
01:21:22,827 --> 01:21:24,377
There's a line with this stuff.

1210
01:21:25,500 --> 01:21:26,338
- Come on, man!

1211
01:21:26,340 --> 01:21:27,363
She's crazy!

1212
01:21:36,074 --> 01:21:37,535
- I just don't
think that chasing Bigfoot

1213
01:21:37,537 --> 01:21:38,578
is the answer.

1214
01:21:38,580 --> 01:21:39,508
- Look, this is a story

1215
01:21:39,510 --> 01:21:40,918
of a lifetime, Steph.

1216
01:21:40,920 --> 01:21:41,878
- Yeah, and what about us?

1217
01:21:41,880 --> 01:21:43,528
What about our life here?

1218
01:21:43,530 --> 01:21:45,448
- I'm going to Red's cabin, all right?

1219
01:21:45,450 --> 01:21:46,283
Come with me.

1220
01:21:48,602 --> 01:21:51,088
- To find Bigfoot?
- Yes.

1221
01:21:51,090 --> 01:21:52,768
All right, look, this
could change the world.

1222
01:21:52,770 --> 01:21:54,658
I want you with me.

1223
01:21:54,660 --> 01:21:57,478
- Josh.
- I owe it to Red.

1224
01:21:57,480 --> 01:21:59,128
- Red tried to kill you.

1225
01:21:59,130 --> 01:22:00,663
You don't owe him anything.

1226
01:22:02,520 --> 01:22:03,920
- You don't know what I saw.

1227
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:08,428
Red didn't deserve what happened to him.

1228
01:22:08,430 --> 01:22:12,476
Kyle didn't deserve what I did to him.

1229
01:22:13,669 --> 01:22:15,252
I gotta fix things.

1230
01:22:17,146 --> 01:22:19,405
I gotta go do this.
