1
00:00:37,023 --> 00:00:38,752
Sometimes...

2
00:00:38,825 --> 00:00:42,226
Dr. Lecter and I would talk
when things got quiet enough...

3
00:00:42,295 --> 00:00:44,354
about the science courses
I was taking, and--

4
00:00:44,431 --> 00:00:45,098
Some kind of mail-order courses
in psychology, Nurse Barney?

5
00:00:45,098 --> 00:00:48,590
Some kind of mail-order courses
in psychology, Nurse Barney?

6
00:00:48,668 --> 00:00:49,930
No, sir.

7
00:00:50,003 --> 00:00:52,938
See, I don't consider
psychology a science...

8
00:00:53,006 --> 00:00:55,372
and neither did Dr. Lecter.

9
00:00:58,411 --> 00:01:02,507
Now, Barney, while you
were working at the asylum...

10
00:01:02,582 --> 00:01:03,116
you observed Clarice Starling
and Hannibal Lecter interacting.

11
00:01:03,116 --> 00:01:08,850
you observed Clarice Starling
and Hannibal Lecter interacting.

12
00:01:08,922 --> 00:01:10,514
Interacting?

13
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:13,286
Talking to one another.

14
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,227
Yes. It seemed to me that they--

15
00:01:16,296 --> 00:01:19,754
I see you're eager to justify
your consulting fee...

16
00:01:19,833 --> 00:01:23,098
but why don't we start
with what you saw...

17
00:01:23,169 --> 00:01:25,262
not what you thought about
what you saw?

18
00:01:25,338 --> 00:01:26,930
Cordell, don't be like that.

19
00:01:27,007 --> 00:01:29,703
Barney can give us his opinion.

20
00:01:29,776 --> 00:01:34,145
Barney, give us your opinion
of what you saw.

21
00:01:34,214 --> 00:01:37,377
What was it between them?

22
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:39,179
Most of the time...

23
00:01:39,252 --> 00:01:42,221
Dr. Lecter didn't respond at all
to visitors.

24
00:01:42,288 --> 00:01:43,846
He'd just, for instance...

25
00:01:43,923 --> 00:01:46,483
open his eyes long enough
to insult some academic...

26
00:01:46,559 --> 00:01:49,585
who was there to look over him.

27
00:01:49,662 --> 00:01:52,392
With Starling,
he answered her questions.

28
00:01:52,465 --> 00:01:54,023
She interested him.

29
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:56,432
She intrigued him.

30
00:01:56,503 --> 00:01:59,802
He thought she was
charming and amusing.

31
00:01:59,873 --> 00:02:03,707
Clarice Starling
and Hannibal Lecter...

32
00:02:03,777 --> 00:02:06,678
became friendly?

33
00:02:06,746 --> 00:02:10,682
Inside a kind
of formal structure, yes.

34
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:13,981
And he was fond of her?

35
00:02:18,758 --> 00:02:19,952
Thank you, Barney.

36
00:02:20,026 --> 00:02:22,017
Thank you very much
for your candor.

37
00:02:22,095 --> 00:02:25,394
And keep all those
wonderful items...

38
00:02:25,465 --> 00:02:28,127
from your personal Lecter
treasure trove coming.

39
00:02:28,201 --> 00:02:30,066
I've enjoyed them immensely.

40
00:02:30,136 --> 00:02:31,865
Mr. Verger.

41
00:02:31,938 --> 00:02:33,030
I almost forgot.

42
00:02:33,106 --> 00:02:35,597
I might be able
to get a cookie down.

43
00:02:35,675 --> 00:02:37,404
What do you say, Cordell?

44
00:02:37,477 --> 00:02:40,446
I think it would kill you.

45
00:02:48,488 --> 00:02:49,614
How much?

46
00:02:49,689 --> 00:02:51,350
250...

47
00:02:51,424 --> 00:02:53,085
thousand.

48
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:54,888
Cordell...

49
00:02:54,961 --> 00:02:59,193
cut a check for $250,000.

50
00:04:53,246 --> 00:04:55,510
How can she sleep
at a time like this?

51
00:04:56,783 --> 00:04:58,512
She was on a jump-out squad
all night.

52
00:04:58,585 --> 00:04:59,984
She's saving her strength.

53
00:05:26,613 --> 00:05:28,103
No problem, sir.

54
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:33,351
We got some guy named Bolton
from the D.C. Police.

55
00:05:34,554 --> 00:05:36,488
All right, everyone,
pay attention.

56
00:05:36,556 --> 00:05:37,784
Here's the layout.

57
00:05:37,857 --> 00:05:40,325
Excuse me.
I'm Officer Bolton, D.C. Police.

58
00:05:40,393 --> 00:05:42,861
I see that from your badge.
How do you do?

59
00:05:42,929 --> 00:05:44,453
I'm in charge here.

60
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:46,725
Officer Bolton,
I'm Special Agent Starling.

61
00:05:46,799 --> 00:05:48,960
So we don't get off
on the wrong foot...

62
00:05:49,035 --> 00:05:51,333
Iet me explain why
we're all here.

63
00:05:51,404 --> 00:05:53,634
I'm here
because I know Evelda Drumgo.

64
00:05:53,706 --> 00:05:55,435
I've arrested her twice
on RICO warrants.

65
00:05:55,508 --> 00:05:58,409
DEA and ATF,
in addition to backing me up...

66
00:05:58,478 --> 00:06:00,241
are here for the drugs
and the weapons.

67
00:06:00,313 --> 00:06:03,441
You're here because our mayor
wants to appear tough on drugs--

68
00:06:03,516 --> 00:06:05,643
especially after his own
cocaine conviction--

69
00:06:05,718 --> 00:06:08,414
and hopes he can accomplish that
by having you join us today.

70
00:06:08,488 --> 00:06:10,649
You got a smart mouth, lady.

71
00:06:10,723 --> 00:06:12,384
Officer, if you wouldn't mind...

72
00:06:12,458 --> 00:06:15,120
I'd appreciate it
if you'd let me continue.

73
00:06:16,262 --> 00:06:18,423
All right, take a look.

74
00:06:18,498 --> 00:06:21,467
Fish market--
back's on the water.

75
00:06:21,534 --> 00:06:23,866
Across the street, ground floor,
is the meth lab.

76
00:06:23,936 --> 00:06:26,336
Evelda Drumgo is HIV positive.

77
00:06:26,406 --> 00:06:29,898
She will spit and bite
if she's cornered, so watch it.

78
00:06:29,976 --> 00:06:32,740
If you happen to be the one
who puts her in a patrol car...

79
00:06:32,812 --> 00:06:34,439
in front of the news cameras,
Officer Bolton...

80
00:06:34,514 --> 00:06:35,947
you don't want
to push her head down.

81
00:06:36,015 --> 00:06:38,176
She'll likely have a needle
in her hair.

82
00:06:38,251 --> 00:06:41,152
We want to take her inside,
not out in the street.

83
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:42,778
We can get closest with the van.

84
00:06:42,855 --> 00:06:44,152
If it looks good,
on my signal...

85
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:46,191
we hit the front,
DEA hits the back...

86
00:06:46,259 --> 00:06:48,318
D.C.P.D. backing them up.

87
00:06:48,394 --> 00:06:50,726
She'll have her watchers out
at least three blocks around.

88
00:06:50,797 --> 00:06:52,526
They've tipped her before
in time...

89
00:06:52,598 --> 00:06:55,066
so let's not make spectacles
of ourselves.

90
00:07:06,512 --> 00:07:09,743
-Pretty busy today.
-I agree.

91
00:07:15,688 --> 00:07:18,350
Can I please get
a cup of coffee?

92
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:37,339
-Did you see that?
-That's a roger.

93
00:07:46,252 --> 00:07:47,549
What's up, man?

94
00:07:57,530 --> 00:07:58,895
God damn it. It's her--

95
00:07:58,965 --> 00:08:01,399
with three guys.
They're all packing.

96
00:08:01,467 --> 00:08:03,059
She's carrying something.

97
00:08:03,136 --> 00:08:04,228
She's got a baby.

98
00:08:04,303 --> 00:08:07,739
Hey, Brigham,
it's too crowded.

99
00:08:07,807 --> 00:08:09,274
There are too many people.

100
00:08:09,342 --> 00:08:11,310
I say we call it off.
What do you say?

101
00:08:11,377 --> 00:08:13,402
I agree.

102
00:08:13,479 --> 00:08:15,845
All units, stand down.

103
00:08:15,915 --> 00:08:18,145
-Whiskey Team copies.
-Burke copy.

104
00:08:18,217 --> 00:08:20,082
This is Bolton. Stay on target.

105
00:08:20,153 --> 00:08:22,883
I said all units stand down,
Bolton, right now.

106
00:08:22,955 --> 00:08:25,082
-Too late. We're moving in.
-Bolton, it's off.

107
00:08:25,158 --> 00:08:26,921
Stand down now.

108
00:08:26,993 --> 00:08:29,587
She's carrying a baby.

109
00:08:29,662 --> 00:08:31,027
All units stand down.

110
00:08:31,097 --> 00:08:32,428
Keep that gun down, Bolton.

111
00:08:32,498 --> 00:08:34,432
Dude got a piece.
Light his ass up.

112
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,161
It's a go. FBl!

113
00:09:19,512 --> 00:09:21,104
Hold it!

114
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:23,205
Hold your fire!

115
00:09:25,184 --> 00:09:26,549
Don't!

116
00:09:29,622 --> 00:09:32,056
Evelda, get out of the car!

117
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,552
Starling, is that you?

118
00:09:36,996 --> 00:09:39,829
Step away from the car!

119
00:09:41,467 --> 00:09:43,526
Show me your hands, Evelda.

120
00:09:45,204 --> 00:09:46,831
Please...

121
00:09:46,906 --> 00:09:48,305
show me your hands.

122
00:09:48,374 --> 00:09:49,966
How have you been?

123
00:09:50,042 --> 00:09:51,771
Don't do this.

124
00:09:51,844 --> 00:09:52,936
Do what?

125
00:10:25,211 --> 00:10:27,509
It's all right. It's OK.

126
00:10:28,548 --> 00:10:29,640
I know, I know.

127
00:10:29,715 --> 00:10:33,082
Baby, I know. It's OK.

128
00:10:57,343 --> 00:10:59,709
Friends, family, and co-workers
gathered here this morning...

129
00:10:59,779 --> 00:11:01,371
at Arlington
National Cemetery...

130
00:11:01,447 --> 00:11:03,915
to bury BATF agent
John Brigham...

131
00:11:03,983 --> 00:11:05,848
shot and killed
in the line of duty Friday.

132
00:11:05,918 --> 00:11:07,249
He was forty years old.

133
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:10,812
This ill-fated drug raid that
claimed his life and 5 others...

134
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:13,688
is the latest in a seemingly
endless series of incidents...

135
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:15,090
beginning with Waco, Texas...

136
00:11:15,161 --> 00:11:17,686
in which the Justice Department
and the FBl...

137
00:11:17,763 --> 00:11:20,459
have been questioned
about their use of firepower...

138
00:11:20,533 --> 00:11:21,727
rather than judgment.

139
00:11:21,801 --> 00:11:24,395
This time, it was FBI Special
Agent Clarice Starling...

140
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:26,165
heading up the calamitous
strike force.

141
00:11:26,238 --> 00:11:29,571
Starling attained some measure
of celebrity ten years ago...

142
00:11:29,642 --> 00:11:31,371
when she was given
information...

143
00:11:31,444 --> 00:11:33,412
by Dr. Hannibal
"the Cannibal" Lecter...

144
00:11:33,479 --> 00:11:35,447
which led to the rescue
of Catherine Martin...

145
00:11:35,514 --> 00:11:37,948
daughter of the former
U.S. senator from Tennessee.

146
00:11:38,017 --> 00:11:40,383
However, when she returns
to work later this week...

147
00:11:40,453 --> 00:11:41,977
she won't be so celebrated.

148
00:11:42,054 --> 00:11:43,316
Attorney Telford Higgins...

149
00:11:43,389 --> 00:11:45,050
representing one of the families
of those slain...

150
00:11:45,124 --> 00:11:47,115
says he will file
a wrongful death suit.

151
00:12:02,742 --> 00:12:03,674
Yes, sir.

152
00:12:03,743 --> 00:12:06,234
Get me the Justice Department.

153
00:12:13,552 --> 00:12:15,349
Agent Starling?

154
00:12:15,421 --> 00:12:17,048
This is John Eldridge from DEA.

155
00:12:17,123 --> 00:12:19,148
Assistant Director Noonan,
of course, you know.

156
00:12:19,225 --> 00:12:22,388
Larkin Wayne from our Office
of Professional Responsibility.

157
00:12:22,461 --> 00:12:24,486
Bob Sneed, ATF.

158
00:12:24,563 --> 00:12:26,724
Benny Holcombe,
assistant to the mayor...

159
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:28,926
and Paul Krendler.
You know Paul.

160
00:12:29,001 --> 00:12:30,336
Paul's come over from Justice
unofficially as a favor to us.

161
00:12:30,336 --> 00:12:32,827
Paul's come over from Justice
unofficially as a favor to us.

162
00:12:32,905 --> 00:12:35,499
In other words,
he's here, and he's not here.

163
00:12:37,743 --> 00:12:41,474
You've seen the coverage
in the papers and on television?

164
00:12:41,547 --> 00:12:44,141
I have nothing to do
with the news, Mr. Krendler.

165
00:12:44,216 --> 00:12:47,083
The woman had a baby
in her arms.

166
00:12:47,153 --> 00:12:48,643
There are pictures.

167
00:12:48,721 --> 00:12:50,120
You can see the problem,
I would think.

168
00:12:50,189 --> 00:12:51,486
Not in her arms.

169
00:12:51,557 --> 00:12:53,582
In a carrier across her chest.

170
00:12:53,659 --> 00:12:55,752
In her arms, she had a MAC-10.

171
00:12:55,828 --> 00:12:58,922
Look, we're here to help you,
Starling.

172
00:12:58,998 --> 00:13:02,024
It's going to be harder to do
with a combative attitude.

173
00:13:07,106 --> 00:13:09,074
Can I speak freely,
Mr. Pearsall?

174
00:13:11,343 --> 00:13:12,435
Your agency
called this office...

175
00:13:12,511 --> 00:13:14,445
to get me assigned to help you
on this raid.

176
00:13:14,513 --> 00:13:16,481
I tried to do that.

177
00:13:16,549 --> 00:13:19,746
I clearly expressed my judgment
and was ignored...

178
00:13:19,819 --> 00:13:22,754
and now a good agent and friend
is dead.

179
00:13:25,858 --> 00:13:28,418
You shot and killed five people
out there, Agent Starling.

180
00:13:28,494 --> 00:13:30,724
Is that how you define
good judgment?

181
00:13:30,796 --> 00:13:33,788
This raid was an ugly mess.

182
00:13:33,866 --> 00:13:37,097
I ended up in a position where
I had a choice of dying...

183
00:13:37,169 --> 00:13:39,069
or shooting a woman
carrying a child.

184
00:13:39,138 --> 00:13:41,800
I chose.

185
00:13:41,874 --> 00:13:43,171
I shot her.

186
00:13:43,242 --> 00:13:46,769
I killed a mother
holding her child...

187
00:13:48,814 --> 00:13:51,180
And I regret it.
I resent myself for it.

188
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:53,946
Gentlemen, I'm going to
halt this meeting...

189
00:13:54,019 --> 00:13:56,283
and get back to you
individually by phone.

190
00:14:00,626 --> 00:14:02,651
Waste of time.

191
00:14:04,563 --> 00:14:06,724
You have a secret admirer,
Starling.

192
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:11,463
Isn't much to look at, but he
has friends in high places.

193
00:14:11,537 --> 00:14:14,404
Remember Mason Verger?

194
00:14:14,473 --> 00:14:17,033
Lecter's fourth victim--

195
00:14:17,109 --> 00:14:18,576
the rich one.

196
00:14:18,644 --> 00:14:21,112
The only one that survived.

197
00:14:22,481 --> 00:14:24,881
He has new Lecter information.
He'll only share it with you.

198
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:26,474
What do you mean,
only share it with me?

199
00:14:26,552 --> 00:14:28,577
You want it, seize it.

200
00:14:28,654 --> 00:14:30,246
We'd rather not.

201
00:14:30,322 --> 00:14:31,846
I wasn't speaking to you,
Mr. Krendler.

202
00:14:31,924 --> 00:14:34,449
When I speak to you,
I'll look at you.

203
00:14:35,861 --> 00:14:37,624
Why would we rather not?

204
00:14:37,696 --> 00:14:38,856
The last time he called...

205
00:14:38,931 --> 00:14:42,389
was when we took Lecter
off the Ten Most Wanted List.

206
00:14:42,468 --> 00:14:44,959
He was upset about that.
We said, "Hey, that's life."

207
00:14:45,037 --> 00:14:48,370
He said, "Hey, this is
a senate oversight committee...

208
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,067
"to make your life miserable."

209
00:14:50,142 --> 00:14:51,803
His family's
political contributions...

210
00:14:51,877 --> 00:14:54,903
may not be enough
to buy a senator...

211
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:57,005
but they are enough to rent them
from time to time.

212
00:14:57,082 --> 00:14:58,811
There's no reason to go
through that again...

213
00:14:58,884 --> 00:15:02,320
if he really does have
something new.

214
00:15:03,522 --> 00:15:06,286
It's a good deal for you,
Starling.

215
00:15:06,358 --> 00:15:07,552
You can't pretend it isn't.

216
00:15:08,894 --> 00:15:10,919
You get to go back
on a celebrated case.

217
00:15:10,996 --> 00:15:14,591
I'll take care of the media
for your Drumgo killing.

218
00:15:14,667 --> 00:15:15,827
Everyone's going to be happy.

219
00:15:15,901 --> 00:15:18,461
I'm not happy.

220
00:15:18,537 --> 00:15:22,906
Well, maybe you're
incapable of being happy.

221
00:15:22,975 --> 00:15:23,942
Mr. Krendler...

222
00:15:24,009 --> 00:15:26,534
when you're out
on the street...

223
00:15:26,612 --> 00:15:28,978
you know you might take
a bullet in the line of duty.

224
00:15:29,048 --> 00:15:31,209
You accept it, or you get out.

225
00:15:31,283 --> 00:15:33,046
You live with it.

226
00:15:33,118 --> 00:15:35,985
What you don't
expect or accept...

227
00:15:36,055 --> 00:15:38,649
is taking one in the back
in your boss' office...

228
00:15:38,724 --> 00:15:40,851
for doing your job
exactly as they've taught you.

229
00:15:40,926 --> 00:15:42,621
That makes you unhappy.

230
00:15:42,695 --> 00:15:45,186
Of course,
you're right, Starling...

231
00:15:46,265 --> 00:15:48,165
but it doesn't really
change anything.

232
00:15:48,234 --> 00:15:51,465
It changes everything.
It changes me.

233
00:16:42,855 --> 00:16:45,619
I'm Cordell Doemling,
Mr. Verger's private physician.

234
00:16:45,691 --> 00:16:46,919
How do you do?

235
00:16:46,992 --> 00:16:48,687
If you'd be so kind
as to park down at the end.

236
00:16:55,167 --> 00:16:58,603
One's eyes adjust
to the darkness.

237
00:17:02,808 --> 00:17:05,936
Six to eight
versus an estimate of sixteen.

238
00:17:06,011 --> 00:17:07,706
Dylan, they're saying sales
have slowed down.

239
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:08,940
Seems like
a recurring theme here.

240
00:17:09,014 --> 00:17:11,983
Perhaps corporate spending
on a slowdown.

241
00:17:14,086 --> 00:17:17,283
Mr. Verger,
Agent Starling is here.

242
00:17:17,356 --> 00:17:19,324
Good morning, Mr. Verger.

243
00:17:20,392 --> 00:17:23,850
-Was that a Mustang I heard?
-Yes, it was.

244
00:17:23,929 --> 00:17:25,590
A five liter?

245
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:28,860
Fast.

246
00:17:30,102 --> 00:17:32,627
Cordell,
I think you can leave us now.

247
00:17:32,705 --> 00:17:37,301
I thought I might stay.
Perhaps I could be useful.

248
00:17:37,376 --> 00:17:41,403
You could be useful
seeing about my lunch.

249
00:17:45,317 --> 00:17:47,217
I'd like to attach
this microphone...

250
00:17:47,286 --> 00:17:49,811
to your clothing or your pillow,
if you're comfortable with that.

251
00:17:49,888 --> 00:17:51,719
By all means.

252
00:17:56,895 --> 00:17:58,863
Here.
This should make it easier.

253
00:18:06,638 --> 00:18:10,904
You know, I thank God
for what happened.

254
00:18:10,976 --> 00:18:13,274
It was my salvation.

255
00:18:14,613 --> 00:18:17,912
Have you accepted Jesus,
Agent Starling?

256
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:19,473
Do you have faith?

257
00:18:19,551 --> 00:18:20,779
I was raised Lutheran.

258
00:18:20,853 --> 00:18:23,253
That's not what I asked.

259
00:18:23,322 --> 00:18:24,789
This is Special Agent
Clarice Starling...

260
00:18:24,857 --> 00:18:26,722
5-1-4-3-6-9-0...

261
00:18:26,792 --> 00:18:29,522
deposing Mason R. Verger
on March 20, sworn and attested.

262
00:18:29,595 --> 00:18:31,062
I want to tell you
about summer camp.

263
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:33,360
-It was a wonderful childhood--
-We can get to that later.

264
00:18:33,432 --> 00:18:36,663
We can get to it now.

265
00:18:36,735 --> 00:18:38,669
It all comes to bear.

266
00:18:38,737 --> 00:18:43,299
It was a Christian camp
my father founded...

267
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:47,971
for poor, unfortunate,
castoff little boys and girls...

268
00:18:48,047 --> 00:18:50,845
who would do anything
for a candy bar.

269
00:18:50,916 --> 00:18:53,077
Mr. Verger, I don't need to know
about the sex offenses.

270
00:18:53,152 --> 00:18:54,676
It's all right.

271
00:18:54,753 --> 00:18:56,983
I have immunity
from the U.S. Attorney...

272
00:18:57,056 --> 00:19:02,221
and I have immunity
from the Risen Jesus.

273
00:19:02,294 --> 00:19:04,819
And nobody beats the Riz.

274
00:19:04,897 --> 00:19:06,797
Had you ever seen Dr. Lecter...

275
00:19:06,865 --> 00:19:08,890
before the court assigned you
to him for therapy?

276
00:19:08,967 --> 00:19:10,229
What do you mean?

277
00:19:10,302 --> 00:19:12,167
Socially?

278
00:19:13,906 --> 00:19:14,930
That is what I mean.

279
00:19:15,007 --> 00:19:16,941
Yes, if you don't mind
talking about it.

280
00:19:17,009 --> 00:19:20,001
-Not at all. I'm not ashamed.
-I didn't say you should be.

281
00:19:20,079 --> 00:19:24,539
No. We met conventionally--
as doctor and patient.

282
00:19:24,616 --> 00:19:26,345
How did he end up at your house?

283
00:19:26,418 --> 00:19:29,353
I invited him, of course.

284
00:19:30,556 --> 00:19:32,615
To my pied-à-terre.

285
00:19:32,691 --> 00:19:37,424
I came to the door in my nicest
"come hither" outfit.

286
00:19:37,496 --> 00:19:42,900
I was concerned
he'd be afraid of me...

287
00:19:42,968 --> 00:19:46,426
but he didn't seem to be
afraid of me.

288
00:19:47,806 --> 00:19:49,706
That's almost funny now.

289
00:19:51,176 --> 00:19:53,235
I showed him my toys--

290
00:19:53,312 --> 00:19:56,076
my noose setup,
among other things.

291
00:19:56,148 --> 00:20:00,414
It's a way you sort of
hang yourself, but not really.

292
00:20:00,486 --> 00:20:02,613
It feels good while you...

293
00:20:02,688 --> 00:20:04,383
Well, you know.

294
00:20:05,757 --> 00:20:09,454
Anyway, he said, "Mason..."

295
00:20:09,528 --> 00:20:11,553
Mason, would you like a popper?

296
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:14,030
And I said, "Would l?"

297
00:20:14,099 --> 00:20:16,033
And, wow...

298
00:20:16,101 --> 00:20:18,797
once that kicked in,
I was flying.

299
00:20:18,871 --> 00:20:20,304
He said, "Mason...

300
00:20:20,372 --> 00:20:22,772
"show me how you smile...

301
00:20:22,841 --> 00:20:25,275
"to gain the confidence
of a child."

302
00:20:26,512 --> 00:20:29,481
When I smiled...

303
00:20:29,548 --> 00:20:32,483
he said, "I see how you do it."

304
00:20:32,551 --> 00:20:37,284
The good doctor approached me
with a piece of broken mirror.

305
00:20:37,356 --> 00:20:38,482
"Try this."

306
00:20:39,725 --> 00:20:41,454
Try peeling off your face.

307
00:20:41,527 --> 00:20:45,019
"And feeding it to the dogs."

308
00:20:54,306 --> 00:20:56,035
I can still see it.

309
00:20:57,376 --> 00:20:58,343
Try again.

310
00:20:59,478 --> 00:21:00,604
No, I'm afraid not.

311
00:21:02,314 --> 00:21:04,714
That's entertainment

312
00:21:07,052 --> 00:21:10,579
It seemed like a good idea
at the time.

313
00:21:10,656 --> 00:21:12,487
Mr. Verger,
you indicated to me...

314
00:21:12,558 --> 00:21:15,686
that you'd received
some new information.

315
00:21:34,012 --> 00:21:35,309
Where did this come from?

316
00:21:36,448 --> 00:21:39,576
Buenos Aires.
I received it two weeks ago.

317
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,010
Where is the package it came in?

318
00:21:43,088 --> 00:21:45,113
Good question.

319
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:47,488
There was nothing written on it
of interest.

320
00:21:47,559 --> 00:21:49,550
Cordell, did we throw it out?

321
00:21:50,629 --> 00:21:52,426
I'm afraid we did.

322
00:21:52,497 --> 00:21:53,759
Oh, dear.

323
00:21:53,832 --> 00:21:55,663
You think it'll help?

324
00:21:55,734 --> 00:21:57,895
I hope so.

325
00:21:57,970 --> 00:21:59,665
I hope it'll help you
catch him...

326
00:21:59,738 --> 00:22:04,607
to help cleanse the stigma
of your recent dishonor.

327
00:22:04,676 --> 00:22:06,007
Thank you.
I think that's all I need.

328
00:22:06,078 --> 00:22:09,411
Did you find some rapport
with Dr. Lecter...

329
00:22:09,481 --> 00:22:13,144
in your talks at the asylum?

330
00:22:13,218 --> 00:22:16,187
I know I did
while I was peeling.

331
00:22:16,255 --> 00:22:19,452
We exchanged information
in a civil way.

332
00:22:19,524 --> 00:22:21,890
But always through the glass?

333
00:22:33,872 --> 00:22:35,169
Isn't it funny?

334
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,834
What's that?

335
00:22:37,909 --> 00:22:39,774
You can look at my face...

336
00:22:41,213 --> 00:22:45,775
but you shied
when I said the name of God.

337
00:23:10,509 --> 00:23:11,771
Finding what you want?

338
00:23:11,843 --> 00:23:14,209
Are you sure this is all of it?

339
00:23:14,279 --> 00:23:16,679
That's all there is now.
There was more...

340
00:23:16,748 --> 00:23:21,082
but it's been picked over
little by little over the years.

341
00:23:21,153 --> 00:23:24,748
This stuff's worth lots of money
in certain circles.

342
00:23:26,458 --> 00:23:28,653
It's kind of like the cocaine
that disappears around here...

343
00:23:28,727 --> 00:23:30,194
Iittle by little.

344
00:23:55,187 --> 00:23:57,121
Let me go!

345
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,643
Hey, Barney.

346
00:24:56,715 --> 00:24:59,047
Remember me?

347
00:24:59,117 --> 00:25:01,381
Would you agree for the record,
Agent Starling...

348
00:25:01,453 --> 00:25:03,318
that I've not been
read my rights?

349
00:25:07,659 --> 00:25:09,524
I have not Mirandized Barney.

350
00:25:09,594 --> 00:25:12,324
He is unaware of his rights.

351
00:25:14,032 --> 00:25:16,500
When you turned Dr. Lecter over
to the Tennessee Police--

352
00:25:16,568 --> 00:25:20,561
They weren't civil to him,
and they're all dead now.

353
00:25:20,639 --> 00:25:23,039
They only survived
his company three days.

354
00:25:23,108 --> 00:25:26,043
You survived him six years
at the asylum.

355
00:25:26,111 --> 00:25:29,171
How'd you do that?
It wasn't just being civil.

356
00:25:29,247 --> 00:25:32,011
Yes, it was.

357
00:25:32,083 --> 00:25:35,348
You ever think after he escaped
he might come after you?

358
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:38,253
He once told me
that whenever feasible...

359
00:25:38,323 --> 00:25:41,087
he preferred to eat the rude.

360
00:25:41,159 --> 00:25:44,151
"Free-range rude,"
he called them.

361
00:25:44,229 --> 00:25:47,130
What about you? You ever think
he might come after you?

362
00:25:47,199 --> 00:25:48,632
You ever think about him at all?

363
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:50,793
At least thirty seconds
of every day.

364
00:25:50,869 --> 00:25:52,302
I can't help it.

365
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:56,306
He's always with me,
like a bad habit.

366
00:25:56,374 --> 00:25:58,774
Do you know what happened
to his stuff?

367
00:25:58,844 --> 00:26:00,368
His books, papers, drawings--

368
00:26:00,445 --> 00:26:03,141
Everything got thrown away
when the place closed--

369
00:26:03,215 --> 00:26:04,807
cutbacks.

370
00:26:04,883 --> 00:26:06,373
Barney, I just found out...

371
00:26:06,451 --> 00:26:08,646
that Dr. Lecter's signed copy
of "The Joy of Cooking"...

372
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:12,349
was sold to a private collector
for $16,000.

373
00:26:13,658 --> 00:26:15,626
It was probably a fake.

374
00:26:15,694 --> 00:26:17,423
The seller's affidavit
of ownership...

375
00:26:17,496 --> 00:26:19,862
was signed Karen Phlox.

376
00:26:19,931 --> 00:26:23,298
Do you know Karen Phlox?
You should.

377
00:26:23,368 --> 00:26:24,926
She filled out
your employment application...

378
00:26:25,003 --> 00:26:27,062
only at the bottom,
she signed it "Barney."

379
00:26:27,138 --> 00:26:30,630
Same thing on your tax returns.

380
00:26:33,278 --> 00:26:35,109
You want the book?

381
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:37,114
Maybe I can get it back.

382
00:26:37,182 --> 00:26:39,412
I want the X-ray they shot
after you broke Lecter's arm...

383
00:26:39,484 --> 00:26:41,782
during the attack on that nurse.

384
00:26:41,853 --> 00:26:43,844
And everything else you got.

385
00:26:47,893 --> 00:26:51,659
We used to talk about
a lot of things at night.

386
00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:54,722
After the screaming
finally died down...

387
00:26:58,203 --> 00:27:01,138
We talked about you sometimes.

388
00:27:01,206 --> 00:27:02,605
You want to know what he said?

389
00:27:02,674 --> 00:27:04,938
Go get the X-ray.

390
00:27:11,116 --> 00:27:14,517
-I'm not a bad guy.
-I didn't say you were.

391
00:27:14,586 --> 00:27:17,146
Dr. Chilton was a bad guy.

392
00:27:17,222 --> 00:27:18,519
After your first visit...

393
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:21,889
he started taping
your conversations with Lecter.

394
00:27:24,095 --> 00:27:26,996
These...are valuable.

395
00:27:31,369 --> 00:27:33,166
Go on, now.

396
00:27:34,205 --> 00:27:36,173
You've grieved long enough.

397
00:27:39,945 --> 00:27:41,913
And what'd he say?

398
00:27:43,214 --> 00:27:44,977
What'd he say about me
late at night?

399
00:27:46,217 --> 00:27:49,186
He was talking about inherited,
hard-wired behavior.

400
00:27:49,254 --> 00:27:52,223
He used genetics
in roller pigeons as an example.

401
00:27:52,290 --> 00:27:54,224
They fly way up in the air...

402
00:27:54,292 --> 00:27:57,022
roll backwards in a display,
falling toward the ground.

403
00:27:57,095 --> 00:28:00,622
There are shallow rollers,
and there are deep rollers.

404
00:28:00,699 --> 00:28:02,564
You can't breed
two deep rollers...

405
00:28:02,634 --> 00:28:06,092
or their young, their offspring,
will roll all the way down...

406
00:28:06,171 --> 00:28:08,366
hit and die.

407
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:11,466
Agent Starling
is a deep roller, Barney.

408
00:28:11,543 --> 00:28:15,070
Let us hope
one of her parents was not.

409
00:28:15,146 --> 00:28:17,205
Surely,
the odd confluence of events...

410
00:28:17,282 --> 00:28:19,944
hasn't escaped you, Clarice.

411
00:28:20,018 --> 00:28:23,146
Jack Crawford dangles you
in front of me...

412
00:28:23,221 --> 00:28:25,951
then I give you a bit of help.

413
00:28:26,024 --> 00:28:28,117
Do you think it's because
I like to look at you...

414
00:28:28,193 --> 00:28:32,493
and imagine how good
you would taste...

415
00:28:32,564 --> 00:28:34,657
Clarice?

416
00:28:34,733 --> 00:28:39,432
I don't know. Is it?

417
00:28:39,504 --> 00:28:42,769
I've been in this room
for eight years now, Clarice.

418
00:28:42,841 --> 00:28:46,937
I know they will never, ever
let me out while I'm alive.

419
00:28:47,012 --> 00:28:49,344
What I want is a view.

420
00:28:49,414 --> 00:28:53,145
I want a window where I can see
a tree...or even water.

421
00:28:53,218 --> 00:28:55,015
I want to be
in a Federal institution...

422
00:28:55,086 --> 00:28:56,121
far away from Dr. Chilton.

423
00:28:56,121 --> 00:28:56,780
far away from Dr. Chilton.

424
00:29:09,868 --> 00:29:13,326
The Capponi Correspondence
goes back to the 13th Century.

425
00:29:13,405 --> 00:29:18,138
Dr. Fell might hold in his hand,
his non-ltalian hand...

426
00:29:18,209 --> 00:29:20,700
a note from Dante Alighieri
himself...

427
00:29:20,779 --> 00:29:23,805
but would he recognize it?
I think not.

428
00:29:23,882 --> 00:29:28,319
Gentlemen, you have examined him
in Medieval ltalian...

429
00:29:28,386 --> 00:29:31,082
and I will not deny that
his language is admirable...

430
00:29:31,156 --> 00:29:34,455
for a straniero, but...

431
00:29:34,526 --> 00:29:36,824
is he acquainted
with the personalities...

432
00:29:36,895 --> 00:29:39,386
of the pre-Renaissance Firenze?

433
00:29:39,464 --> 00:29:41,159
I think not.

434
00:29:41,232 --> 00:29:44,030
What if he came upon a note
in the Capponi Library...

435
00:29:44,102 --> 00:29:46,866
say from Guido de Cavalcanti?

436
00:29:46,938 --> 00:29:48,735
Would he recognize that?

437
00:29:48,807 --> 00:29:50,775
I think not.

438
00:29:50,842 --> 00:29:52,639
They're still arguing.

439
00:29:52,711 --> 00:29:56,010
The Capponi Correspondence
goes back to the 13th Century.

440
00:29:56,081 --> 00:29:58,572
Sogliato wants the job
for his nephew.

441
00:29:58,650 --> 00:30:00,277
But the scholars
seem satisfied...

442
00:30:00,351 --> 00:30:02,251
with the temporary guy
they appointed.

443
00:30:03,455 --> 00:30:05,855
If he's such
an expert on Dante...

444
00:30:05,924 --> 00:30:08,586
Iet him lecture on Dante
to the Studiolo.

445
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:10,525
Let him face them if he can.

446
00:30:10,595 --> 00:30:13,723
I look forward to it.
Let's set a date.

447
00:30:13,798 --> 00:30:16,631
Very well. On the 14th.

448
00:30:33,384 --> 00:30:36,182
Dr. Fell?

449
00:30:36,254 --> 00:30:39,155
Chief lnspector Rinaldo Pazzi
of the Questura.

450
00:30:39,224 --> 00:30:42,819
Commendatore.
How can I be of service?

451
00:30:42,894 --> 00:30:45,988
I'm sorry. I'm investigating
the disappearance...

452
00:30:46,064 --> 00:30:48,089
of your predecessor...

453
00:30:48,166 --> 00:30:50,657
Signore de Bonaventura.
I was wondering if--

454
00:30:50,735 --> 00:30:53,033
"Predecessor" implies
I have the job.

455
00:30:53,104 --> 00:30:55,095
Unfortunately, I don't. Not yet.

456
00:30:55,173 --> 00:30:56,765
Though I am hopeful.

457
00:30:56,841 --> 00:30:59,309
They are letting me
look after the library.

458
00:30:59,377 --> 00:31:00,708
For a stipend.

459
00:31:02,514 --> 00:31:04,414
The officers
who first checked...

460
00:31:04,482 --> 00:31:08,384
didn't find any sort
of farewell or suicide note.

461
00:31:08,453 --> 00:31:10,387
I was wondering if you--

462
00:31:10,455 --> 00:31:12,753
If I come across anything
in the Capponi Library...

463
00:31:12,824 --> 00:31:16,089
stuffed in a drawer or book...
I'll call you at once.

464
00:31:18,196 --> 00:31:20,130
Thank you.

465
00:31:21,332 --> 00:31:22,993
You've been reassigned.

466
00:31:26,137 --> 00:31:27,229
Pardon?

467
00:31:27,305 --> 00:31:30,741
You were on the Il Mostro case,
I'm sure I read.

468
00:31:30,809 --> 00:31:31,741
Yes, that's right.

469
00:31:31,810 --> 00:31:33,141
Now you're on this.

470
00:31:33,211 --> 00:31:36,203
This is much less grand a case,
I would think.

471
00:31:36,281 --> 00:31:39,978
Well, if I thought of my work
in those terms...

472
00:31:40,051 --> 00:31:41,643
yes, I guess I'd agree.

473
00:31:41,719 --> 00:31:43,550
A missing person.

474
00:31:43,621 --> 00:31:44,815
Sorry?

475
00:31:44,889 --> 00:31:47,517
Were you unfairly dismissed
from the grander case or...

476
00:31:47,592 --> 00:31:49,560
did you deserve it?

477
00:31:54,065 --> 00:31:57,330
Regarding this one, Dr. Fell...

478
00:31:57,402 --> 00:31:59,336
are the signore's
personal effects...

479
00:31:59,404 --> 00:32:00,769
still at the palazzo?

480
00:32:02,207 --> 00:32:05,904
Packed neatly in four cases
with an inventory.

481
00:32:05,977 --> 00:32:08,639
Alas...no note.

482
00:32:10,281 --> 00:32:13,910
I'll send someone over
to pick them up.

483
00:32:13,985 --> 00:32:15,612
Thank you for your help.

484
00:32:26,097 --> 00:32:28,122
Thanks.

485
00:32:29,701 --> 00:32:31,828
How's it goin'? Any leads?

486
00:32:31,903 --> 00:32:34,895
Yeah, they're all leads.
They just don't lead to him.

487
00:32:40,111 --> 00:32:41,806
I don't know how you live
with this stuff.

488
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,347
Oh, God.

489
00:32:43,414 --> 00:32:45,939
This is from "The Guinness Book
of World Records"...

490
00:32:46,017 --> 00:32:48,611
congratulating me on being
"The Female FBI Agent...

491
00:32:48,686 --> 00:32:50,779
"Who Has Shot and Killed
the Most People."

492
00:33:14,345 --> 00:33:16,336
Geoffrey,
would you excuse me, please?

493
00:33:18,283 --> 00:33:19,477
Sure.

494
00:33:46,244 --> 00:33:48,678
Dear Clarice...

495
00:33:48,746 --> 00:33:50,680
I have followed
with enthusiasm...

496
00:33:50,748 --> 00:33:52,943
the course of your disgrace
and public shaming.

497
00:33:53,017 --> 00:33:54,917
My own never bothered me...

498
00:33:54,986 --> 00:33:58,251
except for the inconvenience
of being incarcerated.

499
00:33:58,323 --> 00:34:01,656
But you may lack perspective.

500
00:34:01,726 --> 00:34:03,990
In our discussions
down in the dungeon...

501
00:34:04,062 --> 00:34:06,462
it was apparent to me
that your father...

502
00:34:06,531 --> 00:34:08,055
the dead night watchman...

503
00:34:08,132 --> 00:34:11,295
figures largely
in your value system.

504
00:34:11,369 --> 00:34:13,997
I think your success
in putting an end...

505
00:34:14,072 --> 00:34:16,438
to Jame Gumb's career
as a couturier...

506
00:34:16,507 --> 00:34:17,633
pleased you most...

507
00:34:17,709 --> 00:34:21,145
because you could imagine
your father being pleased.

508
00:34:21,212 --> 00:34:24,875
But now, alas, you're in
bad odor with the FBl.

509
00:34:24,949 --> 00:34:27,918
Do you imagine your daddy
being shamed by your disgrace?

510
00:34:27,986 --> 00:34:31,046
Do you see him
in his plain pine box...

511
00:34:31,122 --> 00:34:32,783
crushed by your failure?

512
00:34:32,857 --> 00:34:36,452
The sorry, petty end
of a promising career?

513
00:34:36,527 --> 00:34:39,963
What is worst about
this humiliation, Clarice?

514
00:34:40,031 --> 00:34:41,328
Is it how your failure...

515
00:34:41,399 --> 00:34:44,027
will reflect
on your mommy and daddy?

516
00:34:45,370 --> 00:34:47,838
Is your worst fear that people
will now and forever...

517
00:34:47,905 --> 00:34:49,566
believe they were indeed...

518
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:53,337
just good old trailer camp,
tornado-bait, white trash?

519
00:34:53,411 --> 00:34:57,677
And that perhaps you are, too?

520
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:00,549
By the way,
I couldn't help noticing...

521
00:35:00,618 --> 00:35:02,882
on the FBl's
rather dull public website...

522
00:35:02,954 --> 00:35:04,512
that I have been hoisted...

523
00:35:04,589 --> 00:35:07,183
from the Bureau's archives
of the common criminal...

524
00:35:07,258 --> 00:35:09,192
and elevated
to the more prestigious...

525
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:11,694
Ten Most Wanted List.

526
00:35:11,763 --> 00:35:16,097
Is this coincidence,
or are you back on the case?

527
00:35:16,167 --> 00:35:17,930
If so, goody goody.

528
00:35:18,002 --> 00:35:21,733
I need to come out of retirement
and return to public life.

529
00:35:25,543 --> 00:35:27,977
I imagine you sitting
in a dark basement room...

530
00:35:28,046 --> 00:35:31,174
bent over papers
and computer screens.

531
00:35:31,249 --> 00:35:33,046
Is that accurate?

532
00:35:33,117 --> 00:35:37,679
Please tell me truly,
Special Agent Starling.

533
00:35:37,755 --> 00:35:42,624
Regards, your old pal,
Hannibal Lecter, M.D.

534
00:35:44,128 --> 00:35:45,322
P.S.

535
00:35:45,396 --> 00:35:48,695
Clearly this new assignment
is not your choice.

536
00:35:48,766 --> 00:35:50,666
Rather, I suppose it is
part of the bargain...

537
00:35:50,735 --> 00:35:53,568
but you accepted it, Clarice.

538
00:35:53,638 --> 00:35:56,266
Your job is to craft my doom.

539
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:59,070
So I am not sure how well
I should wish you...

540
00:35:59,143 --> 00:36:01,634
but I'm sure
we'll have a lot of fun.

541
00:36:01,712 --> 00:36:04,306
Ta-ta. "H."

542
00:36:11,589 --> 00:36:13,056
On the letter...

543
00:36:13,124 --> 00:36:15,991
there's one partial fingerprint,
here.

544
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:17,687
Not enough to hold up in court,
but--

545
00:36:17,762 --> 00:36:19,161
I know it's him.

546
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:21,460
Where he was when he wrote it
is what I need.

547
00:36:21,532 --> 00:36:23,898
The paper isn't gonna help.

548
00:36:23,968 --> 00:36:26,528
And, yes, it's linen fiber
and on the expensive side...

549
00:36:26,604 --> 00:36:29,664
but, no, it isn't so rare
that you won't find it...

550
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:31,674
in a thousand different
stationary stores...

551
00:36:31,742 --> 00:36:33,175
throughout the world.

552
00:36:33,244 --> 00:36:35,303
It's the same with the ink.

553
00:36:35,379 --> 00:36:37,279
And the same with the wax.

554
00:36:37,348 --> 00:36:40,613
And your Las Vegas postmark,
well, you can check it out...

555
00:36:40,685 --> 00:36:43,745
but I'll bet you a dollar it
came from a remailing service.

556
00:36:43,821 --> 00:36:45,982
No, Las Vegas would be
the last place he'd be.

557
00:36:46,057 --> 00:36:49,151
It'd be an assault
on his sense of taste.

558
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:59,659
Don't you feel eyes
moving over your body, Clarice?

559
00:36:59,737 --> 00:37:01,432
I hardly see how you couldn't.

560
00:37:01,506 --> 00:37:06,637
And don't your eyes move
over the things you want?

561
00:37:06,711 --> 00:37:08,872
All right, then, tell me how.

562
00:37:08,946 --> 00:37:12,438
No. It's your turn
to tell me, Clarice.

563
00:37:12,517 --> 00:37:16,954
You have no more vacations
to sell on Anthrax lsland.

564
00:37:17,021 --> 00:37:19,012
Quid pro quo, Clarice.

565
00:37:19,090 --> 00:37:22,059
I tell you things,
you tell me things.

566
00:37:22,126 --> 00:37:25,527
Not about this case.
About yourself.

567
00:37:25,596 --> 00:37:27,086
Quid pro quo.

568
00:37:27,165 --> 00:37:30,225
Yes or no, Clarice?

569
00:37:41,412 --> 00:37:43,243
Hand cream.

570
00:37:45,249 --> 00:37:47,843
Raw ambergris base.

571
00:37:49,153 --> 00:37:51,587
Tennessee lavender.

572
00:37:52,657 --> 00:37:55,091
Trace of something else.

573
00:37:56,694 --> 00:37:57,854
Fleece.

574
00:37:57,929 --> 00:38:00,557
Lovely.

575
00:38:00,631 --> 00:38:02,155
What's ambergris?

576
00:38:02,233 --> 00:38:04,701
Ambergris is a whale product.

577
00:38:04,769 --> 00:38:07,829
Alas, much as we'd like to,
we can't import it.

578
00:38:07,905 --> 00:38:10,533
Endangered Species Act.

579
00:38:10,608 --> 00:38:11,905
Where isn't it illegal?

580
00:38:11,976 --> 00:38:15,070
Japan, of course.
Couple of places in Europe.

581
00:38:15,146 --> 00:38:18,274
You'd almost certainly find it
somewhere in Paris...

582
00:38:18,349 --> 00:38:20,977
Rome, Amsterdam.

583
00:38:21,052 --> 00:38:22,349
Maybe London.

584
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:26,618
This bouquet was hand engineered
to someone's specifications.

585
00:38:26,691 --> 00:38:28,352
Is there any way
of knowing which shops?

586
00:38:28,426 --> 00:38:30,451
Of course.
We'll give you a list.

587
00:38:30,528 --> 00:38:32,393
It'll be short.

588
00:38:44,742 --> 00:38:47,074
I need opera tickets.

589
00:38:47,144 --> 00:38:49,203
I don't think I got any on me.

590
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,214
It's sold out,
whatever it's called.

591
00:38:51,282 --> 00:38:53,978
It's the pretty, young wife
with the ever-open beak...

592
00:38:54,051 --> 00:38:56,246
who needs opera tickets.

593
00:39:04,662 --> 00:39:05,754
Benetti.

594
00:39:05,830 --> 00:39:07,058
What?

595
00:39:07,131 --> 00:39:08,598
Rewind it.

596
00:39:08,666 --> 00:39:09,963
I can't rewind it.

597
00:39:10,034 --> 00:39:12,935
I'm making a copy.
I'm recording.

598
00:39:23,247 --> 00:39:24,271
What is this?

599
00:39:24,348 --> 00:39:27,476
Camera from a perfume shop
on Via Della Scala.

600
00:39:27,551 --> 00:39:29,542
FBI through lnterpol
requested a copy.

601
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:31,850
-Why?
-They didn't say.

602
00:39:33,691 --> 00:39:34,783
They didn't say?

603
00:39:34,859 --> 00:39:37,123
No. It was actually
kind of weird...

604
00:39:37,194 --> 00:39:40,095
Iike they were making
a point not to say.

605
00:41:23,567 --> 00:41:25,592
Are we going to the opera?

606
00:41:27,638 --> 00:41:28,662
Sorry.

607
00:41:28,739 --> 00:41:30,104
Yes, we are going.

608
00:41:30,174 --> 00:41:31,664
You got tickets.

609
00:41:31,742 --> 00:41:33,004
No, but I will.

610
00:41:33,077 --> 00:41:36,672
In fact,
I was just about to look here.

611
00:41:36,747 --> 00:41:39,147
Please not the back row.

612
00:41:39,216 --> 00:41:42,413
I would like to see it
this time.

613
00:41:42,486 --> 00:41:44,647
Nowhere near the back row.

614
00:41:44,722 --> 00:41:46,314
No matter what the cost.

615
00:43:56,053 --> 00:43:58,487
Tell me, Clarice,
would you want to harm those...

616
00:43:58,556 --> 00:44:00,615
who've forced you
to consider it, though?

617
00:44:00,691 --> 00:44:02,955
It's perfectly OKto feel this.

618
00:44:03,027 --> 00:44:07,726
It's perfectly au naturel
to want to taste the enemy.

619
00:44:22,646 --> 00:44:24,910
It just feels so good.
Tell me, Clarice...

620
00:44:24,982 --> 00:44:27,280
what is your worst memory
of childhood?

621
00:44:27,351 --> 00:44:30,047
-Jesus, Starling!
-Can I help you, Mr. Krendler?

622
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:32,145
What you doing
sitting in the dark?

623
00:44:32,222 --> 00:44:33,655
Thinking about cannibalism.

624
00:44:33,724 --> 00:44:36,522
People in Justice
are thinking, too.

625
00:44:36,594 --> 00:44:37,891
You know that?

626
00:44:37,962 --> 00:44:40,021
They're thinking, "What exactly
is she doing about Lecter?"

627
00:44:40,097 --> 00:44:42,497
Aren't you curious
why he dines on his victims?

628
00:44:42,566 --> 00:44:44,796
And what's the point of that?

629
00:44:44,868 --> 00:44:46,859
Are you writing a book
or you catching a crook?

630
00:44:46,937 --> 00:44:50,202
To show his contempt
for those who exasperate him.

631
00:44:51,542 --> 00:44:54,409
Or sometimes to perform
a public service.

632
00:44:54,478 --> 00:44:57,208
In the case of the flutist,
Benjamin Raspail...

633
00:44:57,281 --> 00:44:58,646
he did it
to improve the sound...

634
00:44:58,716 --> 00:45:01,412
of the Baltimore
Philharmonic Orchestra...

635
00:45:01,485 --> 00:45:03,976
serving the not-so-talented
flute player's sweetbreads...

636
00:45:04,054 --> 00:45:05,112
to the Board...

637
00:45:05,189 --> 00:45:07,453
with a nice Montrachet
at $700 a bottle.

638
00:45:10,194 --> 00:45:12,219
That meal began
with green oysters...

639
00:45:12,296 --> 00:45:13,320
from the Gironde...

640
00:45:13,397 --> 00:45:15,524
followed by the sweetbreads...

641
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:16,759
a sorbet...

642
00:45:16,834 --> 00:45:19,462
and then you can read here
in "Gourmet Cuisine":

643
00:45:19,536 --> 00:45:21,731
"A notable dark
and glossy ragout...

644
00:45:21,805 --> 00:45:24,672
"the constituents
never determined."

645
00:45:24,742 --> 00:45:26,369
I always figured him
for a queer.

646
00:45:26,443 --> 00:45:28,308
Why would you say that, Paul?

647
00:45:28,379 --> 00:45:31,314
Well,
all this artsy-fartsy stuff.

648
00:45:31,382 --> 00:45:33,043
Chamber music, tea party food.

649
00:45:33,117 --> 00:45:35,312
Not that I mean
anything personal...

650
00:45:35,386 --> 00:45:38,651
if you've got a lot of sympathy
for those people.

651
00:45:38,722 --> 00:45:43,625
What I came here to impress
upon you, Starling...

652
00:45:43,694 --> 00:45:45,389
is I better see cooperation.

653
00:45:45,462 --> 00:45:47,987
There are
no little fiefdoms here.

654
00:45:48,065 --> 00:45:50,329
I want to be copied
on every 3-0-2, understand?

655
00:45:51,602 --> 00:45:53,797
If you work with me...

656
00:45:53,871 --> 00:45:56,669
then your so-called career here
might improve.

657
00:45:58,475 --> 00:46:02,741
If you don't,
then all I have to do...

658
00:46:02,813 --> 00:46:06,249
is draw a line through your name
rather than under it...

659
00:46:06,316 --> 00:46:07,681
and it's over.

660
00:46:07,751 --> 00:46:10,219
Paul, what is it with you?

661
00:46:10,287 --> 00:46:13,415
I told you to go home
to your wife. That was wrong?

662
00:46:13,490 --> 00:46:16,687
Don't flatter yourself,
Starling.

663
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:19,558
That was a long time ago.

664
00:46:19,630 --> 00:46:23,691
Why would I hold that
against you?

665
00:46:23,767 --> 00:46:28,727
And besides, this town is full
of corn-pone country pussy.

666
00:46:30,274 --> 00:46:33,573
That said, I wouldn't mind
having a go with you now...

667
00:46:33,644 --> 00:46:35,373
if you want to reconsider.

668
00:46:35,446 --> 00:46:37,676
In the gym, anytime.

669
00:46:37,748 --> 00:46:38,908
No pads.

670
00:46:43,253 --> 00:46:46,017
Is it possible it went out
with the regular mail?

671
00:46:46,090 --> 00:46:49,992
No, I overnighted it to you.
I filled out the slip myself.

672
00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:52,221
This was the day
after your request.

673
00:46:52,296 --> 00:46:53,923
I did it right away.

674
00:46:53,997 --> 00:46:55,589
I don't understand
what happened.

675
00:46:55,666 --> 00:46:57,224
You should have it by now.

676
00:46:57,301 --> 00:46:59,462
I don't.
Can you send me another one?

677
00:46:59,536 --> 00:47:02,300
Sure. I will make another copy
especially for you...

678
00:47:02,372 --> 00:47:04,169
Agent...Clarice?

679
00:47:04,241 --> 00:47:06,209
Is that right?
Can I call you Clarice?

680
00:47:06,276 --> 00:47:07,607
Agent Starling.

681
00:47:07,678 --> 00:47:09,202
I'd appreciate it.

682
00:47:09,279 --> 00:47:10,405
What's your name?

683
00:47:10,481 --> 00:47:13,450
My name is Franco Benetti.
Agent Franco Benetti.

684
00:47:13,517 --> 00:47:15,815
Thank you very much,
Agent Benetti.

685
00:47:16,887 --> 00:47:19,447
-I'll send you tomorrow?
-All right.

686
00:47:22,292 --> 00:47:23,691
Nothin', huh?

687
00:47:23,761 --> 00:47:25,160
Nothin' yet.

688
00:47:25,229 --> 00:47:26,992
Still waitin' on
Florence and London.

689
00:48:03,534 --> 00:48:07,561
The number you have dialed
is not in service at this time.

690
00:48:07,638 --> 00:48:09,105
Please check the numb--

691
00:48:35,265 --> 00:48:37,825
I have information
about Hannibal Lecter.

692
00:48:37,901 --> 00:48:41,268
Have you shared your information
with the police, sir?

693
00:48:41,338 --> 00:48:43,704
I'm required to encourage you
to do so.

694
00:48:45,676 --> 00:48:49,942
Is the reward payable
under special circumstances?

695
00:48:50,013 --> 00:48:52,504
May I suggest
you contact an attorney...

696
00:48:52,583 --> 00:48:55,108
before taking
any possibly illegal action?

697
00:48:55,185 --> 00:48:58,382
There's one in Geneva who is
excellent in these matters.

698
00:48:58,455 --> 00:49:00,446
May I give you
his toll-free number?

699
00:49:00,524 --> 00:49:06,554
The number is
0-0-4-1-2-3-3-1-7.

700
00:49:06,630 --> 00:49:08,359
Thank you for calling.

701
00:49:29,152 --> 00:49:30,585
I was just speaking
with someone--

702
00:49:30,654 --> 00:49:33,054
There's a $100,000 advance.

703
00:49:33,123 --> 00:49:34,954
To qualify for the advance...

704
00:49:35,025 --> 00:49:39,052
a fingerprint must be provided,
in situ, on an object.

705
00:49:39,129 --> 00:49:41,859
Once the print has been
positively identified...

706
00:49:41,932 --> 00:49:44,526
the balance of the money
will be placed in escrow...

707
00:49:44,601 --> 00:49:46,193
at Geneve Credit Suisse...

708
00:49:46,270 --> 00:49:47,760
and may be viewed at any time...

709
00:49:47,838 --> 00:49:50,966
subject to 24-hour
prior notification.

710
00:49:51,041 --> 00:49:53,737
To repeat the message
in French, press two.

711
00:49:53,810 --> 00:49:55,437
In Spanish, press three.

712
00:49:55,512 --> 00:49:56,570
In German--

713
00:50:22,406 --> 00:50:23,532
Buon giorno.

714
00:50:23,607 --> 00:50:26,235
Dr. Fell? It's lnspector Pazzi.

715
00:50:26,310 --> 00:50:28,835
Yes, I can see you.

716
00:50:28,912 --> 00:50:30,470
Come on up.

717
00:51:22,666 --> 00:51:24,224
Snap.

718
00:51:24,301 --> 00:51:27,896
I should have encouraged you
to bring someone along.

719
00:51:27,971 --> 00:51:30,303
The cases, I'm afraid,
are on the heavy side.

720
00:51:30,374 --> 00:51:32,843
Maybe you could
help me with them.

721
00:51:34,011 --> 00:51:35,979
Just down the stairs, I mean.

722
00:51:38,648 --> 00:51:41,208
Yeah. This way.

723
00:51:43,387 --> 00:51:45,287
Here we are.

724
00:51:49,259 --> 00:51:50,726
Is that the inventory?

725
00:51:54,131 --> 00:51:55,894
May I see it?

726
00:51:55,966 --> 00:51:57,126
Of course.

727
00:52:06,743 --> 00:52:09,678
You are a Pazzi of the...

728
00:52:09,746 --> 00:52:11,907
Pazzi family, I think.

729
00:52:13,250 --> 00:52:17,653
Wasn't it at the Palazzo Vecchio
your ancestor was hanged?

730
00:52:17,721 --> 00:52:19,313
Francesco de Pazzi?

731
00:52:19,389 --> 00:52:20,981
Yes, thrown naked...

732
00:52:21,058 --> 00:52:24,027
with a noose around his neck
from a window...

733
00:52:24,094 --> 00:52:26,654
writhing and kicking
alongside the archbishop...

734
00:52:26,730 --> 00:52:29,494
against the cold stone wall.

735
00:52:29,566 --> 00:52:33,832
In fact, I found a very nice
rendering of it here in the...

736
00:52:33,904 --> 00:52:35,735
Iibrary the other day.

737
00:52:35,806 --> 00:52:38,001
If you like, perhaps I could...

738
00:52:38,075 --> 00:52:39,770
sneak it out for you.

739
00:52:39,843 --> 00:52:43,574
I would think that might
jeopardize your chances...

740
00:52:43,647 --> 00:52:46,810
for permanent appointment
to the curatorship.

741
00:52:46,883 --> 00:52:49,044
Only if you told.

742
00:52:50,187 --> 00:52:53,213
Remind me, what was his crime?

743
00:52:53,290 --> 00:52:56,191
He was accused of killing
Giuliano de Medici.

744
00:52:56,259 --> 00:52:57,487
Unjustly?

745
00:52:57,561 --> 00:53:01,258
No. I don't think so.

746
00:53:01,331 --> 00:53:04,357
Then he wasn't just accused.
He did it, he was guilty.

747
00:53:04,434 --> 00:53:06,493
I think that would make
living in Florence...

748
00:53:06,570 --> 00:53:10,472
with the name Pazzi
uncomfortable...

749
00:53:10,540 --> 00:53:12,030
even 500 years later.

750
00:53:12,109 --> 00:53:15,340
Not really.

751
00:53:15,412 --> 00:53:18,040
In fact, I can't remember
the last time...

752
00:53:18,115 --> 00:53:22,552
before today...
someone brought it up.

753
00:53:30,494 --> 00:53:34,055
People don't always tell you
what they're thinking.

754
00:53:34,131 --> 00:53:36,292
They just see to it you don't...

755
00:53:36,366 --> 00:53:39,631
advance in life.

756
00:53:42,706 --> 00:53:46,142
I'm sorry, Commendatore.

757
00:53:46,209 --> 00:53:48,700
I too often say
what I'm thinking.

758
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:52,578
I'll be right back to help you.

759
00:54:07,030 --> 00:54:12,229
The room you're standing in
was built in the 15th Century.

760
00:54:12,302 --> 00:54:13,428
It's beautiful.

761
00:54:14,938 --> 00:54:16,803
Yes, it is.

762
00:54:16,873 --> 00:54:19,706
Unfortunately I think
the heating system...

763
00:54:19,776 --> 00:54:21,767
was installed
about the same time.

764
00:54:23,246 --> 00:54:25,874
That's a pity.

765
00:54:29,553 --> 00:54:32,750
Okey-dokey,
let's drag these down.

766
00:54:32,822 --> 00:54:35,586
They must be as heavy as bodies.

767
00:55:05,789 --> 00:55:07,222
And the set?

768
00:55:07,290 --> 00:55:08,450
Eight thousand.

769
00:55:12,295 --> 00:55:14,729
-How much is this?
-50,000.

770
00:55:14,798 --> 00:55:16,129
I'll take it.

771
00:55:37,220 --> 00:55:38,710
Scusi, signor.

772
00:55:39,923 --> 00:55:41,220
Well done.

773
00:55:44,127 --> 00:55:46,096
Gnocco.

774
00:55:49,399 --> 00:55:53,961
When you go for his wallet,
he'll catch you by the wrist.

775
00:55:54,037 --> 00:55:56,096
I have done this a few times,
lnspector.

776
00:55:56,172 --> 00:55:57,833
Not like this.

777
00:55:59,009 --> 00:56:02,604
If there isn't a clean print
on the bracelet...

778
00:56:02,679 --> 00:56:07,116
you'll spend the summer
in a cell at the Collicciano.

779
00:56:08,351 --> 00:56:11,115
Give me the bracelet.

780
00:56:11,187 --> 00:56:13,382
Wash your fucking hands.

781
00:56:23,266 --> 00:56:24,756
He's coming.

782
00:57:13,116 --> 00:57:14,310
Grazie.

783
00:58:14,811 --> 00:58:15,778
I got it.

784
00:58:21,851 --> 00:58:24,649
He grabbed me just right.

785
00:58:27,891 --> 00:58:30,485
Tried to hit me in the balls.

786
00:58:34,431 --> 00:58:35,921
But he missed.

787
00:58:40,703 --> 00:58:43,263
Let me help you.

788
00:58:43,339 --> 00:58:45,330
No. Don't.

789
00:59:42,265 --> 00:59:44,096
Sixteen point match, Mr. Verger.

790
00:59:46,269 --> 00:59:47,702
Bingo.

791
01:00:05,388 --> 01:00:06,377
Pronto.

792
01:00:06,456 --> 01:00:07,855
Carlo?

793
01:00:07,924 --> 01:00:08,856
Mason?

794
01:00:08,925 --> 01:00:11,291
Ciao, bello. Come stai?

795
01:00:11,361 --> 01:00:13,886
Very well. Well.

796
01:00:13,963 --> 01:00:16,090
Am I coming to see you?

797
01:00:16,165 --> 01:00:17,962
Yes. Soon, I hope.

798
01:00:18,034 --> 01:00:19,433
But...

799
01:00:19,502 --> 01:00:21,766
first, I need you
to pack off the boys.

800
01:00:21,838 --> 01:00:23,829
-Now?
-Yes, I know.

801
01:00:23,907 --> 01:00:26,705
The day you never thought
would arrive has.

802
01:00:26,776 --> 01:00:29,336
Cordell will fax
the veterinary forms...

803
01:00:29,412 --> 01:00:32,609
directly to Animal
and Plant Health...

804
01:00:32,682 --> 01:00:36,778
but you need to get the vet
affidavits from Sardinia.

805
01:00:36,853 --> 01:00:38,377
Va bene?

806
01:00:38,454 --> 01:00:40,251
Bene, bene.

807
01:00:40,323 --> 01:00:42,018
How are they?

808
01:00:42,091 --> 01:00:44,491
They are big, Mason--
very big.

809
01:00:44,561 --> 01:00:46,085
Tommaso.

810
01:00:51,434 --> 01:00:52,366
Say again?

811
01:00:52,435 --> 01:00:55,529
They are big, Mason--
really big.

812
01:00:55,605 --> 01:00:58,369
Maybe 270 kilos.

813
01:01:00,977 --> 01:01:02,604
Can you hear?

814
01:01:04,981 --> 01:01:06,039
Hear!

815
01:01:14,290 --> 01:01:17,157
They sound fantastic.

816
01:01:27,103 --> 01:01:28,468
Super.

817
01:02:03,606 --> 01:02:04,903
The full balance of the money...

818
01:02:04,974 --> 01:02:08,569
is payable upon receipt
of the doctor alive.

819
01:02:08,645 --> 01:02:11,443
Of course, you won't have
to seize him yourself...

820
01:02:11,514 --> 01:02:13,243
rather just point him out.

821
01:02:13,316 --> 01:02:15,978
In fact, it's preferable
to all concerned...

822
01:02:16,052 --> 01:02:18,247
if that's the extent
of your involvement...

823
01:02:18,321 --> 01:02:19,982
from this point.

824
01:02:20,056 --> 01:02:24,186
I prefer to stay involved--
to make sure things go right.

825
01:02:24,260 --> 01:02:26,194
Professionals will see to that.

826
01:02:28,197 --> 01:02:29,960
I am a professional.
