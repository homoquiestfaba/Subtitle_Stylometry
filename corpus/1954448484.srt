1
00:00:57,257 --> 00:01:01,693
<i>You are
extraordinary, my sons.</i>

2
00:01:01,695 --> 00:01:04,229
<i>Unlike anything
the world has ever seen.</i>

3
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:05,564
<i>Bound for greatness.</i>

4
00:01:06,633 --> 00:01:08,333
<i>Destined to protect</i>

5
00:01:08,335 --> 00:01:10,169
<i>the people of New York.</i>

6
00:01:11,638 --> 00:01:13,439
<i>A dark force is growing.</i>

7
00:01:15,542 --> 00:01:19,711
<i>A criminal organization
known as the Foot Clan.</i>

8
00:01:19,713 --> 00:01:22,247
<i>So named
because they step over</i>

9
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:24,383
<i>the good people of this city
with no regard.</i>

10
00:01:25,785 --> 00:01:28,654
<i>Their leader, The Shredder,</i>

11
00:01:28,656 --> 00:01:30,756
<i>will come at you
with ferocity.</i>

12
00:01:30,758 --> 00:01:33,459
<i>His Foot Clan
will outnumber you.</i>

13
00:01:33,461 --> 00:01:35,427
<i>The people of New York
will look upon you</i>

14
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:37,196
<i>as their only hope.</i>

15
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:43,102
<i>Eyes focused.</i>

16
00:01:43,536 --> 00:01:46,138
<i>Elbows locked.</i>

17
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:47,140
<i>Stance low.</i>

18
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:49,675
<i>And we begin.</i>

19
00:01:52,245 --> 00:01:53,612
<i>Be one with the blades.</i>

20
00:01:54,747 --> 00:01:56,548
<i>Lead their path.</i>

21
00:01:57,817 --> 00:02:01,153
<i>I know you are eager
to answer their calls,</i>

22
00:02:01,155 --> 00:02:03,222
<i>but your training
is not yet complete.</i>

23
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,192
<i>The world below
must remain your home.</i>

24
00:02:09,562 --> 00:02:12,397
<i>As your father,
you must trust me.</i>

25
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:14,633
<i>Patience.</i>

26
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:15,635
<i>Patience.</i>

27
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:20,205
<i>You're not yet ready
to go above ground.</i>

28
00:02:20,207 --> 00:02:22,047
<i>But I believe
when that day comes</i>

29
00:02:22,575 --> 00:02:25,811
<i>and you rise to the streets,</i>

30
00:02:25,813 --> 00:02:27,880
<i>you are going to be
responsible</i>

31
00:02:27,882 --> 00:02:30,315
<i>for amazing things.</i>

32
00:02:46,766 --> 00:02:47,599
Mr. Rivetti!

33
00:02:47,601 --> 00:02:50,903
Mr. Rivetti.
Mr. Rivetti, please.

34
00:02:50,905 --> 00:02:52,437
You're the most
persistent human

35
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:54,373
I've ever met in my life,
I swear.

36
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:56,408
Look, I already told the cops
everything, all right?

37
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:57,743
But maybe there's a detail

38
00:02:57,745 --> 00:02:59,344
you could've forgotten
to share with the police.

39
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:00,612
Sweetheart, you don't forget
something like that.

40
00:03:00,614 --> 00:03:02,714
Ten guys storm in here,
broad daylight,

41
00:03:02,716 --> 00:03:04,616
force us to the ground
at gunpoint.

42
00:03:04,618 --> 00:03:06,585
And these are
restricted chemicals.

43
00:03:06,587 --> 00:03:09,922
Benzyl cyanide and some
deaminating agents, too.

44
00:03:09,924 --> 00:03:12,324
You don't just buy this stuff,
even on the black market.

45
00:03:12,326 --> 00:03:13,625
Wait, you said
deaminating agents,

46
00:03:13,627 --> 00:03:15,527
those are used
in genetic research.

47
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:17,196
Is there anybody else

48
00:03:17,198 --> 00:03:19,264
that's trafficking these
sort of chemicals besides you?

49
00:03:19,266 --> 00:03:20,632
There's one other
high-security facility

50
00:03:20,634 --> 00:03:22,534
along this waterfront.

51
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:24,836
But they don't move
nearly as much cargo as we do.

52
00:03:24,838 --> 00:03:28,440
O'Neil! We're live
in 30 minutes! Come on!

53
00:03:28,442 --> 00:03:29,908
Uh... No, no, no,
I'll be right back.

54
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,510
Please don't go anywhere.
I'll be right back.

55
00:03:31,512 --> 00:03:32,644
Come on, you're killing me.

56
00:03:32,646 --> 00:03:34,313
I'm working.

57
00:03:34,315 --> 00:03:35,547
That's a paying job?
No.

58
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:36,949
Because we have
an actual paying job.

59
00:03:36,951 --> 00:03:38,684
Look, you don't think that
every crime reporter

60
00:03:38,686 --> 00:03:40,619
in the city has been trying to
work this Foot Clan story?

61
00:03:40,621 --> 00:03:42,521
I know that, but there is
a new angle on this,

62
00:03:42,523 --> 00:03:44,823
and I am this close
to getting it.

63
00:03:44,825 --> 00:03:46,491
I just need
a couple of more...

64
00:03:48,329 --> 00:03:50,295
Let's just stick
to what we're good at.

65
00:03:50,297 --> 00:03:51,530
Let's stick to what we're
good at. We're good at it.

66
00:03:52,298 --> 00:03:54,266
In five, four...

67
00:03:57,437 --> 00:03:59,805
Hi, guys, this is April O'Neil
from Channel 6 News

68
00:03:59,807 --> 00:04:01,673
and I am here
in beautiful New York City

69
00:04:01,675 --> 00:04:03,275
on the first day of spring.

70
00:04:03,277 --> 00:04:04,643
And you know what that means.

71
00:04:04,645 --> 00:04:06,712
It is time to shed
that pesky winter weight.

72
00:04:06,714 --> 00:04:08,580
And here with me today

73
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:10,716
is celebrity fitness trainer
Harley Pasternak. Hi, Harley.

74
00:04:10,718 --> 00:04:11,950
Good morning, April.

75
00:04:11,952 --> 00:04:13,819
Twenty years I've studied
the animal kingdom.

76
00:04:13,821 --> 00:04:15,020
There are fat pigs,
there are fat cows.

77
00:04:15,022 --> 00:04:17,322
There are no fat birds.

78
00:04:17,324 --> 00:04:20,525
All right, I want you
to visualize a sexy seagull.

79
00:04:20,527 --> 00:04:22,928
So we're going to squat down
and flap your wings.

80
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:25,330
Right over there.
Full extension.

81
00:04:25,498 --> 00:04:27,499
Picture you're leaving
the cold north

82
00:04:27,501 --> 00:04:29,701
and you're flying.
You're migrating.

83
00:04:29,703 --> 00:04:32,304
Four years of journalism
school so that I can do that.

84
00:04:32,306 --> 00:04:33,472
Four years of my life, Vern.

85
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:35,974
It's embarrassing.

86
00:04:35,976 --> 00:04:37,709
Look, O'Neil, I get it,

87
00:04:37,711 --> 00:04:38,910
you want to be
a serious journalist.

88
00:04:38,912 --> 00:04:39,978
I see you sniffing around
the newsroom

89
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,713
for the big stories.

90
00:04:41,715 --> 00:04:44,383
But it's also okay
to just give people something

91
00:04:44,385 --> 00:04:46,285
a little lighter.
A little... Little froth.

92
00:04:46,287 --> 00:04:47,686
Froth?
You know, how,

93
00:04:47,688 --> 00:04:49,521
when you get a coffee,
it's just, like, coffee,

94
00:04:49,523 --> 00:04:51,356
then they put a little froth
on it. It's kind of nice.

95
00:04:51,358 --> 00:04:52,724
Vern, that's foam.

96
00:04:52,726 --> 00:04:54,993
Yes, foam, froth,
you get the point.

97
00:04:54,995 --> 00:04:57,529
It's just... It's nice,
it tastes good, it's candy.

98
00:04:57,531 --> 00:04:58,731
You ever heard the expression,

99
00:04:58,732 --> 00:04:59,865
"Never take candy
from a baby"?

100
00:04:59,867 --> 00:05:01,933
It's because
even babies love candy!

101
00:05:01,935 --> 00:05:03,402
It's nice.
And you're giving people

102
00:05:03,404 --> 00:05:04,803
something they like
that's good and nice.

103
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:06,005
They look at you and they see,

104
00:05:06,006 --> 00:05:08,340
"Wow, there's a nice...
There's...

105
00:05:08,342 --> 00:05:12,077
"...candy."
The point is, I think that

106
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:14,746
you should be rewarded,
not punishing yourself. Okay?

107
00:05:14,748 --> 00:05:16,882
And I'm...
I'm prepared to reward you.

108
00:05:16,884 --> 00:05:18,483
I say that we go to my buddy's
old restaurant downtown.

109
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:19,918
It's very vibey...

110
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,386
We just ate
on the way over here.

111
00:05:21,388 --> 00:05:22,721
No, I know we just...
I'm not saying

112
00:05:22,723 --> 00:05:24,723
for a full meal, we're just
gonna eat appeteasers.

113
00:05:24,725 --> 00:05:25,891
I got to go
finish that interview.

114
00:05:25,893 --> 00:05:27,092
I'll see you
at the office, Vern!

115
00:05:27,094 --> 00:05:28,460
I will see you at the office!

116
00:05:43,443 --> 00:05:45,477
I just wanted
to follow up, Mr. Rivetti.

117
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:46,878
<i>Are you kidding me?
How did you get my number?</i>

118
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,982
<i>Listen, I already told you</i>
<i>everything I know</i>
<i>about this crime, everything.</i>

119
00:05:50,984 --> 00:05:53,352
<i>Okay, you wanna know
anything else,</i>

120
00:05:53,354 --> 00:05:54,720
<i>you go back down to the docks
and you see</i>

121
00:05:54,722 --> 00:05:56,054
<i>my guy Stan. He'll tell you</i>

122
00:05:56,056 --> 00:05:57,389
<i>anything else
you need to know, okay?</i>

123
00:05:57,391 --> 00:05:58,523
<i>And hey, do me a favor.</i>

124
00:05:58,525 --> 00:05:59,725
<i>Lose my number, all right?</i>

125
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:18,203
Good.
It's clear.
Let's open it up.

126
00:06:19,812 --> 00:06:21,847
Container's good.
Move on to the next one.

127
00:06:21,849 --> 00:06:23,529
Move it out!
Get those to the trucks now!

128
00:06:28,421 --> 00:06:30,522
Move out,
next point! Go, go, go.

129
00:06:38,465 --> 00:06:40,499
<i>Channel 6.</i>
Chris.

130
00:06:40,501 --> 00:06:42,067
Chris, it's April.
I'm at the docks.

131
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:45,170
Whatever you got
can wait for tomorrow.
<i>No, no, I need...</i>

132
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,480
2-3-2, clear!

133
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:02,587
- Get it out of my way.
- Copy that.

134
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:06,858
Damn it.

135
00:07:14,867 --> 00:07:15,947
Unit two, area three, move!

136
00:07:34,587 --> 00:07:35,821
I've got movement!

137
00:07:35,823 --> 00:07:36,823
Keep your eyes over here!

138
00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:37,889
Weapons free!

139
00:07:38,758 --> 00:07:39,825
Hold position!

140
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:50,936
Retreat! Retreat!

141
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:54,039
Get out of here!

142
00:08:38,584 --> 00:08:39,985
Taylor. Taylor!

143
00:08:39,987 --> 00:08:41,853
Hey. I'm Skyping with my mom.

144
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:43,522
You have no idea
what I just went through.

145
00:08:43,524 --> 00:08:45,257
I am freaking out.
I saw a Foot Clan attack.

146
00:08:45,259 --> 00:08:46,758
Are you okay?

147
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,159
I was riding my bike
by the docks.

148
00:08:48,161 --> 00:08:50,161
It was night,
it's dark already

149
00:08:50,163 --> 00:08:52,030
and there are
Foot Clan soldiers everywhere.

150
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:53,632
Then out of nowhere,
there was this guy

151
00:08:53,634 --> 00:08:55,066
fighting back against them.

152
00:08:55,068 --> 00:08:57,002
And he...
He left behind this symbol.

153
00:08:57,004 --> 00:08:58,203
And I know
that I've seen it before.

154
00:08:58,205 --> 00:08:59,871
I can't remember where.

155
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:01,907
But there is someone
fighting back

156
00:09:01,909 --> 00:09:03,642
against the Foot Clan.

157
00:09:03,644 --> 00:09:05,110
There is a vigilante
in this city.

158
00:09:05,112 --> 00:09:06,912
And no one knows, but I do.

159
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:11,249
I know.
And now I have my story.

160
00:09:11,251 --> 00:09:14,786
There is no more
froth and foam for me.

161
00:09:17,256 --> 00:09:18,657
What?

162
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:20,892
Never mind.

163
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:26,898
All right, we need a lead
for tonight. Who's got it?

164
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,266
"Major redevelopments proposed

165
00:09:28,268 --> 00:09:30,168
"for lower Manhattan."
No.

166
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:33,171
I got something.
"NYPD task force taking credit

167

00:09:44,151 --> 00:09:45,717
but I think that you're gonna

175
00:09:45,719 --> 00:09:49,054
I actually think that you're
all gonna want to hear
what I have to say.

176
00:09:49,056 --> 00:09:50,922
Um, I witnessed

177
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:52,924
an attempted Foot Clan robbery

178
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:55,093
at the docks
in Brooklyn last night.

179
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:57,195
Hold on, the scanner said
that gunshots were heard,

180
00:09:57,197 --> 00:09:59,197
but there were no reports
of any Foot Clan activity.

181
00:09:59,199 --> 00:10:00,265
That's because
whatever they were

182
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:01,766
attempting to do was stopped.

183
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:02,834
What were you doing
in Brooklyn anyway?

184
00:10:02,836 --> 00:10:04,736
Was there
a trampoline convention?

185
00:10:04,738 --> 00:10:06,371
I was in Brooklyn
because I was reporting,

186
00:10:06,373 --> 00:10:07,339
not sitting behind my desk,
McNaughton.

187
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:09,274
Okay, kids!

188
00:10:10,376 --> 00:10:11,743
Who stopped it?

189
00:10:12,812 --> 00:10:15,146
Well, there was this guy.

190
00:10:15,148 --> 00:10:18,149
I didn't see him clearly,
but he was swinging

191
00:10:18,151 --> 00:10:19,784
these giant
shipping containers

192
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:22,687
and knocking these guys
into the... Into the river.

193
00:10:22,689 --> 00:10:25,090
There is a vigilante
that is fighting back

194
00:10:25,092 --> 00:10:28,159
against the Foot Clan.
There's a huge story here!

195
00:10:28,161 --> 00:10:31,096
O'Neil, I think you found
Superman. That's cool.

196
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:34,899
The vigilante is real.
I saw him.

197
00:10:34,901 --> 00:10:36,868
O'Neil, I'm gonna assume

198
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:39,404
that you would not
come up here and tell us

199
00:10:39,406 --> 00:10:41,973
this fantastic story
without some tangible proof.

200
00:10:44,076 --> 00:10:47,412
I took this photo of one
of the shipping containers.

201
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:52,417
I actually think that
it may be his calling card.

202
00:10:52,419 --> 00:10:55,420
This is nothing,
O'Neil. This is nothing!

203
00:10:55,422 --> 00:10:57,889
That's exactly the point.
Somebody

204
00:10:57,891 --> 00:11:00,825
stopped a Foot robbery
and left no evidence.

205
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:01,827
There is nothing.

206
00:11:02,895 --> 00:11:04,996
Oh, I get it.

207
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:07,298
You wanted me to put "nothing"

208
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,267
on the nightly news.
Of course not.

209
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:11,202
You know, I'm gonna pretend we
never had this conversation.

210
00:11:11,204 --> 00:11:13,204
I'm erasing it from my mind.

211
00:11:13,206 --> 00:11:15,006
And the rest of us,
we're gonna go back to work.

212
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:16,248
Let's hit it!

213
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:20,979
<i>Hello, everybody.</i>
<i>Welcome to the Channel 6</i>
<i>Morning News.</i>

214
00:11:20,981 --> 00:11:22,847
<i>New developments in that
ongoing sanitation strike</i>

215
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:24,315
<i>to tell you about.</i>

216
00:11:24,317 --> 00:11:26,217
But first,
after reviewing the city's

217
00:11:26,219 --> 00:11:28,820
soaring crime rates
with the police commissioner,

218
00:11:28,822 --> 00:11:31,356
Councilman Dan Gregor took
to the steps of City Hall,

219
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:33,324
reaffirming
the city's commitment

220
00:11:33,326 --> 00:11:35,727
to fight against the rising
crime organization

221
00:11:35,729 --> 00:11:37,162
calling themselves
the Foot Clan.

222
00:11:37,164 --> 00:11:39,230
He did so on the heels
of a renewed

223
00:11:39,232 --> 00:11:42,000
contract with Eric Sacks
and Sacks Industries.

224
00:11:42,002 --> 00:11:45,070
<i>Using the Sacks research
and securities technology,</i>

225
00:11:45,072 --> 00:11:47,238
<i>this city greatly improves
its chances</i>

226
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,374
<i>of bringing the Foot Clan
to justice!</i>

227
00:12:35,888 --> 00:12:38,089
We couldn't have anticipated
the vigilante

228
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:40,391
showing up at the docks,
Master Shredder.

229
00:12:48,834 --> 00:12:50,769
But we've never seen
an enemy like this.

230
00:12:52,371 --> 00:12:53,838
Their size.

231
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,906
Their strength.

232
00:12:56,308 --> 00:12:57,776
They're not human.

233
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:04,415
I don't believe
in fairy tales.

234
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:10,088
It's what society wants
to reduce the Foot Clan to.

235
00:13:10,356 --> 00:13:12,290
A myth.

236
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:13,792
But the Foot Clan

237
00:13:14,994 --> 00:13:17,395
will rise again.

238
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:23,067
Capture the vigilantes
however you can.

239
00:13:23,069 --> 00:13:25,336
Use innocent people as bait.

240
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:30,008
No one will stop us
in our quest

241
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:31,943
to reclaim victory.

242
00:13:32,945 --> 00:13:35,547
We will own this city.

243
00:13:40,352 --> 00:13:42,320
<i>Ladies
and gentlemen, please join me</i>

244
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:44,989

245
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:46,391

<i>Please, please. Please.</i>

247
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:55,400
<i>Sit down, sit down.</i>

248
00:13:55,402 --> 00:13:58,036
<i>I have to say,</i>

249
00:13:58,038 --> 00:14:00,605
<i>it's wonderful to see so many
people out here tonight,</i>

250
00:14:00,607 --> 00:14:02,207
<i>especially in a neighborhood</i>

251
00:14:02,209 --> 00:14:05,310
<i>so hard hit
by the Foot's crime wave.</i>

252
00:14:05,312 --> 00:14:08,413
<i>Years ago, my life
was touched by tragedy.</i>

253
00:14:08,415 --> 00:14:10,114
<i>I was a young scientist</i>

254
00:14:10,116 --> 00:14:12,417
<i>working with
a world-class team</i>

255
00:14:12,419 --> 00:14:14,152
<i>on cutting-edge research.</i>

256
00:14:16,088 --> 00:14:17,889
<i>And our laboratory
was attacked,</i>

257
00:14:17,891 --> 00:14:20,091
<i>set fire to, robbed,</i>

258
00:14:20,093 --> 00:14:22,894
<i>by the cowards that
call themselves the Foot Clan.</i>

259
00:14:22,896 --> 00:14:24,495
<i>Several of my employees</i>

260
00:14:27,499 --> 00:14:28,699
<i>lost their lives that day.</i>

261
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:33,238
<i>And it is in their honor,
in their memory,</i>

262
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:37,041
<i>that Sacks Industries,
whether through Sacks Biomed,</i>

263
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:39,444
<i>Sacks Robotics
or Sacks Construction,</i>

264
00:14:39,446 --> 00:14:44,115
<i>to keeping the city
of New York, our city,</i>

265
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:46,451
<i>safe.</i>

266
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:52,590
<i>So whenever someone
takes flame to this city,</i>

267
00:14:54,526 --> 00:14:56,527
<i>I will be there
to put the fire out.</i>

268
00:14:57,663 --> 00:14:59,330
<i>And that's a promise.</i>

269
00:14:59,332 --> 00:15:01,199
<i>Thank you. Thank you.</i>

270
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,334
<i>Thank you.</i>

271
00:15:12,344 --> 00:15:15,113
Great work, sir.
Very inspirational.

272
00:15:15,115 --> 00:15:18,583
Mr. Sacks. April O'Neil.
You worked with my father.

273
00:15:18,585 --> 00:15:19,617
Oh!

274
00:15:19,619 --> 00:15:23,187
I can't believe it.
I haven't seen you since...

275
00:15:23,189 --> 00:15:24,222
Since his funeral.

276
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,057
It was a long time ago.

277
00:15:26,059 --> 00:15:28,192
Yeah.

278
00:15:28,194 --> 00:15:29,527
I just wanted to tell you
that your words

279
00:15:29,529 --> 00:15:32,931
really resonated with me,
and I hope to one day

280
00:15:32,933 --> 00:15:35,333
contribute to the city
in the way that you do.

281
00:15:35,335 --> 00:15:37,001
Well, it looks like you're
doing a pretty good job.

282
00:15:37,003 --> 00:15:38,636
Channel 6, very impressive,
April.

283
00:15:38,638 --> 00:15:41,673
Um... Thank you. It's, uh...

284
00:15:41,675 --> 00:15:46,244
It isn't exactly everything
I anticipated it would be.

285
00:15:46,246 --> 00:15:48,646
As long as you are
true to yourself,

286
00:15:48,648 --> 00:15:50,581
your father will always
be proud of you.

287
00:15:51,717 --> 00:15:54,652
Mr. Sacks, we have to be
uptown at 7:00.

288
00:15:56,155 --> 00:15:57,155
I'll see you on TV.

289
00:16:07,734 --> 00:16:09,600
Eric Sacks was
so inspiring.

290
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,204
I know this is a story
that actually matters.

291
00:16:15,507 --> 00:16:17,308
The superhero one?

292
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:19,550
That's a good idea.
I should chase that down.

293
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:22,721
Where's everybody going?

294
00:16:27,086 --> 00:16:28,252
- O'Neil! Where are you going?
- Hey.

295
00:16:28,254 --> 00:16:29,487
April!
Hey!

296
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:31,089
What are you running from?
Wait, wait!

297
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:36,127
<i>Shots fired,
Broadway and Centre Street.</i>

298
00:16:36,129 --> 00:16:39,664
Heavy Foot Clan activity
at the Broad Street platform.

299
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:43,434
But you know
we're not supposed
to go above ground.

300
00:16:43,436 --> 00:16:46,537
We started something,
we gotta finish it.

301
00:16:46,539 --> 00:16:48,272
This is insane.

302
00:16:48,274 --> 00:16:51,275
That cat is playing <i> Chopsticks</i>
with chopsticks!

303
00:16:51,277 --> 00:16:52,610
Don't be an idiot.

304
00:16:52,612 --> 00:16:54,178
- Aw.
- Okay.

305
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,513
Let's rock 'n' roll, boys!

306
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:12,330
Run!

307
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:15,099
Get out!

308
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:19,270
Go, go!

309
00:17:33,352 --> 00:17:35,486
If you want to live, do it!
Go on!

310
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:55,373
Just stay down!

311
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:57,408
Get over here!

312
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:58,843
Keep moving!

313
00:17:58,845 --> 00:18:00,711
Keep your
hands where I can see them!

314
00:18:04,216 --> 00:18:05,216
Move to the side.

315
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:08,853
- They're bombs.
- Shut up!

316
00:18:08,855 --> 00:18:09,975
On the ground!

317
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:14,192
Nobody move!

318
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,266
We know you're out there!

319
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:27,572
If you don't surrender,
we start executing hostages!

320
00:18:27,574 --> 00:18:29,373
Get your
head down! Don't move!

321
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:35,680
Don't make me
tell you again! Not a word!

322
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:39,684
Don't look at me!

323
00:18:39,686 --> 00:18:41,552
Don't! Don't do it!

324
00:18:44,724 --> 00:18:45,756
You!

325
00:18:46,258 --> 00:18:47,391
Stand up!

326
00:18:48,594 --> 00:18:49,694
All aboard!

327
00:18:58,170 --> 00:18:59,303
On your 12!

328
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:00,305
Come on!

329
00:19:16,156 --> 00:19:17,156
That's right.

330
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:20,691
Like a shadow, bra.

331
00:19:27,399 --> 00:19:28,466
Let's go!
Let's move!

332
00:19:33,706 --> 00:19:37,708
Right here.
Some kind of freak!

333
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:39,177
There were a couple of them!

334
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:40,611
Whoo! Right past me!

335
00:19:40,613 --> 00:19:41,879
They saved us.

336
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:50,855
Go, go, go!

337
00:19:56,495 --> 00:19:57,628
Let's go, guys! Both sides!

338
00:20:04,436 --> 00:20:06,337
Yeah, that's
what I'm talking about!

339
00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:11,909
Yeah, boys, bring it in.

340
00:20:13,512 --> 00:20:15,446
That was amazing.
You were incredible!

341
00:20:15,448 --> 00:20:17,415
Great elbow, Donnie.

342
00:20:17,417 --> 00:20:19,383
Oh, yeah!
That's what I'm talking about.

343
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:21,419
This is our city!
These are our streets!

344
00:20:21,421 --> 00:20:22,286
You mess
with us, you step into

345
00:20:22,288 --> 00:20:23,988
the Wu, whoo, Tang!

346
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:25,323
Ooh, yeah!
Did you see that guy's

347
00:20:25,325 --> 00:20:27,258
jaw connect with the concrete?

348
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:29,260
He'll be drinking
out of a sippy cup for months!

349
00:20:29,262 --> 00:20:30,661
Ah, that's what
I'm talking about, brothers.

350
00:20:30,663 --> 00:20:33,631
Like shadows in the night.
Completely unseen.

351
00:20:38,705 --> 00:20:41,239
It's a camera flash.

352
00:20:41,241 --> 00:20:43,975
Who's behind the camera flash?

353
00:20:43,977 --> 00:20:45,810
By my calculations,
it's a girl.

354
00:20:45,812 --> 00:20:49,747
Give her some flowers,
earn her trust.

355
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:51,349
I got this.
Raph, no, no, no! Come on!

356
00:21:04,296 --> 00:21:06,464
Give me the camera.

357
00:21:06,466 --> 00:21:08,633
Ooh, look, he's
doing his Batman voice.

358
00:21:15,707 --> 00:21:18,042
She's so hot, I can feel
my shell tightening.

359
00:21:18,044 --> 00:21:19,377
We can hear you!

360
00:21:21,647 --> 00:21:24,749
If you don't give me
the camera, I'm gonna...

361
00:21:24,751 --> 00:21:25,850
Enough!

362
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:29,787
Back off, Raph.

363
00:21:31,591 --> 00:21:33,357
I only saw <i>Batman</i> once!

364
00:21:34,993 --> 00:21:37,461
Ma'am, hello. I apologize.

365
00:21:39,398 --> 00:21:41,999
My colleague here
forgot to say "please."

366
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:43,668
So,

367
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:47,938
would you please
hand over the camera?

368
00:21:49,007 --> 00:21:51,342
No, no, no, no. Whoa.

369
00:21:51,344 --> 00:21:53,944
Whoa. Chill. It's just a mask.
See? Don't freak out.

370
00:21:55,547 --> 00:21:56,614
Right?

371
00:21:58,050 --> 00:21:59,083
Ah!

372
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:01,886
<i>Oh, I think that went well.</i>

373
00:22:03,622 --> 00:22:05,523
Breathing steady.
Blood pressure stabilizing.

374
00:22:05,525 --> 00:22:06,857
Why are we still here
playing doctor?

375
00:22:06,859 --> 00:22:08,392
She may have a head injury.

376
00:22:08,394 --> 00:22:09,794
Uh, correction.
She's a hot chick

377
00:22:09,796 --> 00:22:11,495
who may have a head injury,
which makes it

378
00:22:11,497 --> 00:22:12,977
- our civic duty to...
- Ma'am, ma'am.

379
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,099
Can you hear me? Do you know
what city you're in?

380
00:22:15,101 --> 00:22:17,601
Do you know where you are?

381
00:22:17,603 --> 00:22:18,836
Have you seen that video
where the cat

382
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:21,105
plays <i> Chopsticks</i>
with the chopsticks?

383
00:22:21,107 --> 00:22:22,707
Can we focus here?

384
00:22:22,709 --> 00:22:24,875
Guys, please!
Come on. Give her some air.

385
00:22:24,877 --> 00:22:26,043
What are you?

386
00:22:26,545 --> 00:22:28,446
Well, Miss,

387
00:22:28,448 --> 00:22:30,047
uh, we're ninjas.

388
00:22:30,049 --> 00:22:31,682
We're mutants.

389
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:33,050
Well, technically,
we're turtles.

390
00:22:33,052 --> 00:22:34,785
Oh, and we're teenagers!

391
00:22:34,787 --> 00:22:38,389
But we can still have
adult conversations.

392
00:22:38,391 --> 00:22:39,457
Wait, wait, wait. So...

393
00:22:41,059 --> 00:22:42,460
You're...

394
00:22:43,395 --> 00:22:45,529
Ninja, mutant,

395
00:22:46,565 --> 00:22:50,401
turtle, teenagers?

396
00:22:50,403 --> 00:22:52,803
Well, when you put it like
that, it sounds ridiculous!

397
00:22:52,805 --> 00:22:54,972
See, she's looking at us
like we're freaks.

398
00:22:54,974 --> 00:22:56,907
I bet that's why you took
our picture, wasn't it?

399
00:22:56,909 --> 00:22:58,809
To show your friends?

400
00:22:58,811 --> 00:23:01,545
Bro, that's a good thing!
Maybe she has hot friends.

401
00:23:01,547 --> 00:23:03,080
Looking for this?
Don't break it.

402
00:23:03,082 --> 00:23:05,082
No, no, no. Please.

403
00:23:05,084 --> 00:23:07,051
How many times
do I have to tell you?

404
00:23:07,053 --> 00:23:09,887
We don't break things,
we fix them.

405
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:11,655
Donnie already wiped
the phone, genius.

406
00:23:11,657 --> 00:23:13,657
Problem solved, moving on.

407
00:23:13,659 --> 00:23:15,726
And who put you in charge?
You know who did.

408
00:23:15,728 --> 00:23:18,062
Ooh, tension! It's been like
30 whole minutes

409
00:23:18,064 --> 00:23:19,797
since you guys
had this argument.

410
00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:20,965
Leonardo, if we want
to make it home before Master,

411
00:23:20,967 --> 00:23:21,967
we gotta hustle.

412
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:24,001
Leonardo?

413
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:30,975
Do not say a word
about this to anyone.

414
00:23:30,977 --> 00:23:34,011
If you do, we will find you.

415
00:23:34,013 --> 00:23:35,913
April O'Neil.

416
00:23:37,983 --> 00:23:39,950
We're on the move, Raphael.

417
00:23:41,554 --> 00:23:43,187
Raphael?

418
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,927
Yeah!

419
00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:53,164
We'll find you, O'Neil.

420
00:23:55,467 --> 00:23:56,600
I'm sorry, that came across

421
00:23:56,602 --> 00:23:59,470
super creepy, okay?

422
00:23:59,472 --> 00:24:00,712
We will find you, though.

423
00:24:05,011 --> 00:24:06,076
I was on fire, bro!

424
00:24:07,078 --> 00:24:08,979
Did you see me back there?

425
00:24:08,981 --> 00:24:10,147
Guys, I totally
talked to a girl!

426
00:24:10,149 --> 00:24:11,615
Shut up, Mikey!

427
00:24:17,722 --> 00:24:18,889
Yeah, bra!

428
00:24:39,612 --> 00:24:40,945
Mikey, was that you?

429
00:24:40,947 --> 00:24:43,147
Pepperoni.

430
00:24:43,149 --> 00:24:45,109
Leonardo. I know those
names. I know those names.

431
00:24:46,017 --> 00:24:47,785
Raphael, Raphael. Leonardo.

432
00:25:13,044 --> 00:25:14,044
<i>Good evening.</i>

433
00:25:14,046 --> 00:25:15,980
<i>This is April O'Neil,</i>

434
00:25:15,982 --> 00:25:17,748
<i>reporting live
from my daddy's lab.</i>

435
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:19,750
<i>I know it sounds
pretty boring,</i>

436
00:25:19,752 --> 00:25:22,620
<i>but actually, he does
some pretty cool stuff.</i>

437
00:25:22,622 --> 00:25:24,054
<i>Time to put
the camera away, April.</i>

438
00:25:24,056 --> 00:25:25,890
<i>Aw, Dad!</i>

439
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:32,029
<i>And now I will show you</i>

440
00:25:32,031 --> 00:25:34,164
<i>something amazing.</i>

441
00:25:34,166 --> 00:25:37,301
<i>It's supposed to be
from a different planet</i>

442
00:25:37,303 --> 00:25:38,702
<i>in outer space!
Here we go.</i>

443
00:25:39,104 --> 00:25:40,604
<i>Ah!</i>

444
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,040
<i>Mr. Sacks,</i>

445
00:25:43,042 --> 00:25:45,676
<i>what sort of experiments
are you doing here?</i>

446
00:25:45,678 --> 00:25:47,945
<i>Oh, that's
a very complicated question.</i>

447
00:25:47,947 --> 00:25:49,627
<i>We're trying to change
the world.</i>

448
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:52,182
<i>Look at the camera!</i>

449
00:25:52,184 --> 00:25:54,084
<i>Hello, Splinter.</i>

450
00:25:58,290 --> 00:26:00,991
<i>And these are
my little turtles, Leonardo,</i>

451
00:26:01,593 --> 00:26:03,661
<i>Raphael,</i>

452
00:26:03,663 --> 00:26:05,996
<i>Michelangelo and Donatello.</i>

453
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,334
<i>The fans want to see you!</i>

454
00:26:16,608 --> 00:26:17,675
I knew it.

455
00:26:21,947 --> 00:26:25,349
The vigilante, I saw him.
I saw them! I saw them.

456
00:26:25,351 --> 00:26:27,051
I've known them
since I was a little girl.

457
00:26:27,053 --> 00:26:28,218
They were my pets.

458
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:30,220
They were my childhood pets,

459
00:26:30,222 --> 00:26:33,190
and they were named after
Italian Renaissance painters.

460
00:26:34,826 --> 00:26:37,294
Mom, I want to move back home.

461
00:26:40,231 --> 00:26:41,265
Is he here?

462
00:26:41,267 --> 00:26:42,267
I don't see him.

463
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:44,234
Donnie?

464
00:26:44,236 --> 00:26:46,870
My thermal scans indicate
there's a 74% variable

465
00:26:46,872 --> 00:26:48,906
that there's
a 61% chance he's not...

466
00:26:48,908 --> 00:26:49,773
That he's not here, guys.

467
00:26:49,775 --> 00:26:50,641
That he's not here.

468
00:26:50,643 --> 00:26:51,842
Okay.

469
00:26:51,844 --> 00:26:54,812
Fall in, quietly.

470
00:27:01,721 --> 00:27:02,886
Dude.

471
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:08,892
So, guys, if it wasn't already
obvious with that girl,

472
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:12,229
dibs.

473
00:27:12,231 --> 00:27:13,764
If Master Splinter catches us,

474
00:27:13,766 --> 00:27:15,733
he'll send us
back to the Ha'shi.

475
00:27:15,735 --> 00:27:17,368
I ain't going back
to the Ha'shi.

476
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:19,870
Every time we're in the
Ha'shi, it's because of you.

477
00:27:19,872 --> 00:27:21,939
Well, bro, you won't have
to worry about me

478
00:27:21,941 --> 00:27:23,240
dragging you down anymore.

479
00:27:23,242 --> 00:27:25,042
What's that supposed to mean?

480
00:27:25,044 --> 00:27:28,012
I'm going out on my own.
First chance I get.

481
00:27:28,014 --> 00:27:29,880
How are we gonna finish our
hip-hop Christmas album, bro?

482
00:27:29,882 --> 00:27:31,122
You're the hype man!

483
00:27:32,118 --> 00:27:33,851
Shut up.

484
00:27:33,853 --> 00:27:35,085
Shut up.

485
00:27:36,855 --> 00:27:39,189
I got glop in my eye.

486
00:27:39,191 --> 00:27:42,393
Shh! He's not going anywhere.
We all stick together.

487
00:27:42,395 --> 00:27:43,894
Sorry I spit
in your eye, bro.

488
00:27:43,896 --> 00:27:45,536
Shh!
Guys? Guys.

489
00:27:46,765 --> 00:27:48,132
We got a bogey.

490
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:50,668
Uh...

491
00:27:55,107 --> 00:27:56,306
Where have you been?

492
00:27:56,308 --> 00:27:58,375
We weren't...

493
00:27:58,377 --> 00:28:00,144
I forgot to soak my retainer!

494
00:28:01,246 --> 00:28:02,813
I'm totally sleepwalking!

495
00:28:02,815 --> 00:28:04,748
Look, Mikey's
sleeping and walking.

496
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:07,217
He's totally innocent.

497
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:11,088
Enough!
You disobeyed a direct order.

498
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:13,090
Why did you go above ground?
What happened?

499
00:28:15,394 --> 00:28:17,061
Very well.

500
00:28:17,063 --> 00:28:19,863
If that's how
it's going to be,

501
00:28:19,865 --> 00:28:21,899
to the Ha'shi!

502
00:28:33,478 --> 00:28:36,180
O'Neil! All right, what was so
important I had to get here?

503
00:28:36,182 --> 00:28:37,448
Okay. Are you ready?
Yeah.

504
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:39,016
Okay.
You know how

505
00:28:39,018 --> 00:28:40,317
I saw the vigilante?
Yeah.

506
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:42,319
But I had no photos
or evidence to show you,

507
00:28:42,321 --> 00:28:43,787
so I just sounded crazy.

508
00:28:43,789 --> 00:28:45,189
Yes.
Okay. But I saw him again.

509
00:28:45,191 --> 00:28:46,356
Well, I didn't see him again,

510
00:28:46,358 --> 00:28:48,325
I saw them,
because there's four.

511
00:28:48,327 --> 00:28:50,360
There's not just one, there's
four. And I was standing

512
00:28:50,362 --> 00:28:51,395
as close to them
as you are to me right now.

513
00:28:51,397 --> 00:28:52,930
What'd they look like?

514
00:28:52,932 --> 00:28:53,932
I'll show you.

515
00:28:55,467 --> 00:28:56,934
What?

516
00:28:56,936 --> 00:28:58,035
Like this.

517
00:28:58,037 --> 00:28:59,970
Like turtles?

518
00:28:59,972 --> 00:29:01,405
Well, they don't
look like turtles

519
00:29:01,407 --> 00:29:04,141
because they are turtles.

520
00:29:04,143 --> 00:29:07,044
They're over six feet tall
and they speak English.

521
00:29:09,181 --> 00:29:10,914
Oh, my God.

522
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:13,050
I was awake all night, please
look, I was awake all night

523
00:29:13,052 --> 00:29:15,119
googling all
of the thwarted crimes

524
00:29:15,121 --> 00:29:17,321
over the past three months,
and this symbol

525
00:29:17,323 --> 00:29:18,956
appeared at every single one.

526
00:29:18,958 --> 00:29:20,858
Look!
Every single one of them.

527
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:23,127
This one, look.
Here, here, here, here, here.

528
00:29:23,129 --> 00:29:25,410
And it's an ancient Japanese
symbol that means "family."

529
00:29:25,797 --> 00:29:27,331
Wait, it's on my laptop.

530
00:29:27,333 --> 00:29:29,800
I can't believe
you brought me in to do this!

531
00:29:29,802 --> 00:29:31,535
It's here, it's here.

532
00:29:31,537 --> 00:29:33,070
This is my father's lab.

533
00:29:33,072 --> 00:29:34,805
This is the same lab

534
00:29:34,807 --> 00:29:36,206
where these things were born

535
00:29:36,208 --> 00:29:38,008
or created
or mutated.

536
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:39,143
Or, I don't know
the terminology,

537
00:29:39,145 --> 00:29:41,245
but will you please
just look at what

538
00:29:41,247 --> 00:29:43,080
I'm showing you and listen
to me. It's all connected.

539
00:29:43,082 --> 00:29:44,948
The turtles are
the vigilantes

540
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:46,984
and the vigilantes
are these turtles.

541
00:29:46,986 --> 00:29:48,352
<i>Pizza has cheese,</i>

542
00:29:48,354 --> 00:29:51,188
<i>tomato sauce,
all your favorite stuff.</i>

543
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:54,258
<i>Eat it. You guys need
nutrition. Or not.</i>

544
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:55,492
I just want to be clear.

545
00:29:55,494 --> 00:29:58,462
You are now telling me
that there are

546
00:29:58,464 --> 00:30:02,566
four six-foot talking turtles
walking around New York City,

547
00:30:02,568 --> 00:30:04,101
and no one has
seen them but you?

548
00:30:04,103 --> 00:30:05,803
That's what I'm telling you.

549
00:30:05,805 --> 00:30:07,471
I don't mean to laugh,

550
00:30:07,473 --> 00:30:09,953
but is there anything else
we should know about them?

551
00:30:10,208 --> 00:30:11,408
They're ninjas.

552
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:13,243
I'm sorry, what?

553
00:30:13,245 --> 00:30:15,012
And they do karate.

554
00:30:15,014 --> 00:30:16,014
Okay, get out.

555
00:30:20,585 --> 00:30:21,819
O'Neil!

556
00:30:26,858 --> 00:30:28,492
It could have been worse.

557
00:30:28,494 --> 00:30:31,161
I just got fired, Vern.
How could it be worse?

558
00:30:31,163 --> 00:30:32,596
Maybe it's good. Maybe you
should take a little time,

559
00:30:32,598 --> 00:30:33,831
take care of yourself.

560
00:30:34,566 --> 00:30:36,400
Come on,
let me give you a ride.

561
00:30:36,402 --> 00:30:38,268
Not unless you're going
to the Eric Sacks estate.

562
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:40,437
April... Hey!
I'm not giving up
on this story.

563
00:30:40,439 --> 00:30:42,573
You gotta put that to bed.

564
00:30:42,575 --> 00:30:44,274
Would all of those
other great reporters

565
00:30:44,276 --> 00:30:46,143
that you worked with, would
they have "put it to bed"?

566
00:30:46,145 --> 00:30:47,444
No. That's different.

567
00:30:47,446 --> 00:30:49,546
How is it different?

568
00:30:49,548 --> 00:30:51,849
They all started exactly
where I am, right?

569
00:30:58,356 --> 00:30:59,556
I'm not driving the
Channel 6 news van

570
00:30:59,558 --> 00:31:01,391
onto the Sacks estate.

571
00:31:01,393 --> 00:31:03,260
Who asked you to do that?
Uh, you did.

572
00:31:03,262 --> 00:31:05,128
And a "thanks"
would have been nice.

573
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:07,297
Maybe one day
you're gonna be thanking me.

574
00:31:12,303 --> 00:31:13,604
So, what do you want
with Eric Sacks?

575
00:31:13,606 --> 00:31:16,340
My dad used to work for him.

576
00:31:16,342 --> 00:31:17,641
He's the only person
that's gonna be able

577
00:31:17,643 --> 00:31:19,376
to tell me whether
or not I'm crazy.

578
00:31:19,378 --> 00:31:20,978
Crazy about what?

579
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:22,012
I don't need you
to laugh at me also.

580
00:31:22,014 --> 00:31:23,247
Oh, come on, O'Neil.

581
00:31:23,249 --> 00:31:25,983
This is
the Fenwick Express, it's a

582
00:31:25,985 --> 00:31:28,465
judgment-free zone.
A cocoon of safety.

583
00:31:28,653 --> 00:31:30,954
Promise?

584
00:31:30,956 --> 00:31:32,996
I'm insulted that
you would suggest otherwise.

585
00:31:37,295 --> 00:31:41,098
Ooh, 11 hours in the Ha'shi.

586
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:44,001
Are you sure none of you
want to tell me

587
00:31:44,003 --> 00:31:46,570
where you were last night?

588
00:31:46,572 --> 00:31:48,372
How you holding up, fellas?

589
00:31:48,374 --> 00:31:51,408
Ah! I ain't breaking
if Donnie ain't breaking.

590
00:31:54,613 --> 00:31:57,347
Experiencing intense nausea
but not breaking.

591
00:32:03,955 --> 00:32:06,523
Guys? I'm in the zone!

592
00:32:06,525 --> 00:32:08,959
There is literally nothing
that could break me right now!

593
00:32:10,161 --> 00:32:12,195
Starting to break.

594
00:32:12,197 --> 00:32:15,032
Of course, you've all tasted
the five-cheese pizza.

595
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:17,935
But this,

596
00:32:17,937 --> 00:32:19,703
cheesemongers have speculated

597
00:32:19,705 --> 00:32:22,339
of its existence
for centuries.

598
00:32:22,341 --> 00:32:25,142
Da Vinci's
original masterpiece.

599
00:32:25,144 --> 00:32:26,977
I submit to you...

600
00:32:31,016 --> 00:32:33,517
...the 99-cheese pizza.

601
00:32:36,321 --> 00:32:38,088
Oh!

602
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:40,590
It's not possible.

603
00:32:40,592 --> 00:32:42,993
Mikey, it's a trap!
A pizza with that variety

604
00:32:42,995 --> 00:32:45,062
of cheese
is a culinary impossibility!

605
00:32:45,064 --> 00:32:48,165
Shall I list the ingredients?
No.

606
00:32:48,167 --> 00:32:49,733
Cheddar...

607
00:32:49,735 --> 00:32:51,735
Provolone...
Mikey, don't you do it!

608
00:32:51,737 --> 00:32:53,236
Asiago...

609
00:32:53,238 --> 00:32:54,204
Keep it together!

610
00:32:54,206 --> 00:32:55,639
Taleggio...

611
00:32:55,641 --> 00:32:57,274
I don't even
know what that is.

612
00:32:57,276 --> 00:32:58,742
Mozzarella, of course.

613
00:33:00,578 --> 00:33:02,212
All right, all right,
all right! We left the lair

614
00:33:02,214 --> 00:33:04,081
because the Foot
were taking hostages

615
00:33:04,083 --> 00:33:05,349
and we kicked
some serious butt,

616
00:33:05,351 --> 00:33:06,683
and there was this girl
named April O'Neil

617
00:33:06,685 --> 00:33:08,118
who took our picture,

618
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,486
but we took care of it.

619
00:33:09,488 --> 00:33:11,154
Idiot.

620
00:33:11,156 --> 00:33:15,258
Oh, no, my worst fears
have been realized.

621
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:17,094
Don't worry about it.
Donnie erased the picture!

622
00:33:17,096 --> 00:33:18,595
We're not in danger.

623
00:33:18,597 --> 00:33:23,000
No. It's April O'Neil
who is in danger!

624
00:33:23,002 --> 00:33:26,169
Find the girl. Bring her here.

625
00:33:26,171 --> 00:33:27,337
But, <i> sensei,</i>
you said to not go...

626
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:28,538
Find the girl!

627
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:30,173
Find the girl.

628
00:33:36,147 --> 00:33:38,181
That's what I told
Thompson and she fired me.

629
00:33:39,217 --> 00:33:41,785
So they're aliens?

630
00:33:42,487 --> 00:33:44,488
No, that's stupid.

631
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:46,089
They're reptiles.

632
00:33:47,225 --> 00:33:49,359
They help people, I guess.

633
00:33:51,295 --> 00:33:53,263
Heroes in the half-shell.

634
00:33:53,265 --> 00:33:55,465
Okay.
Come on. It's not that crazy.

635
00:33:55,467 --> 00:33:59,469
I... The animal kingdom
is full of...

636
00:33:59,471 --> 00:34:01,711
I used to have a dog
that could moonwalk.

637
00:34:06,077 --> 00:34:07,244
Thanks for the ride, Vern.

638
00:34:07,246 --> 00:34:08,486
Yeah. No problem.

639
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,114
Nothing better than

640
00:34:11,116 --> 00:34:13,436
dropping off a pretty girl
at a rich guy's house.

641
00:34:21,794 --> 00:34:24,795
Hi, it's April O'Neil,
here to see Eric Sacks.

642
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:40,510
April's arrived
early this year.

643
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:41,812
I'm sorry to barge in on you
like this, Mr. Sacks.

644
00:34:41,814 --> 00:34:43,814
No, no, no. Please, please.

645
00:34:43,816 --> 00:34:45,348
Thank you.

646
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:46,783
I've been working on a story.

647
00:34:46,785 --> 00:34:48,819
And I have this theory that
there are these vigilantes

648
00:34:48,821 --> 00:34:51,121
that are fighting back
against the Foot.

649
00:34:51,123 --> 00:34:53,483
I think you and my father
may have created them.

650
00:34:54,792 --> 00:34:56,626
Uh, I'm not sure I...

651
00:34:56,628 --> 00:34:57,828
Can you please tell me
everything that you know

652
00:34:57,830 --> 00:34:59,729
about Project Renaissance?

653
00:35:03,401 --> 00:35:04,401
Hmm.

654
00:35:05,636 --> 00:35:07,838
Well, um, it was a dream.

655
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:11,508
A dream that died
with your father.

656
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:12,876
What if it isn't dead?

657
00:35:12,878 --> 00:35:15,178
That's impossible.

658
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:17,280
We lost all our research
in the fire,

659
00:35:17,282 --> 00:35:19,182
all our specimens, everything.

660
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:21,885
I've spent the last 15 years

661
00:35:21,887 --> 00:35:24,121
trying to replicate
the results.

662
00:35:24,123 --> 00:35:26,523
You didn't lose everything
in the fire.

663
00:35:37,768 --> 00:35:38,835
This can't be real.

664
00:35:38,837 --> 00:35:40,403
It is real.

665
00:35:40,405 --> 00:35:41,838
I saw all four of them.

666
00:35:43,674 --> 00:35:46,676
Do you really want to know
about Project Renaissance?

667
00:35:46,678 --> 00:35:48,378
Yes.
Come with me.

668
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:53,216
I was born in Japan,
at a military base in Okinawa.

669
00:35:54,285 --> 00:35:55,886
My father went to Vietnam.

670
00:35:57,221 --> 00:35:59,222
Didn't come back.

671
00:35:59,224 --> 00:36:01,158
I was an outsider
in a foreign land.

672
00:36:02,693 --> 00:36:04,494
A freak.

673
00:36:04,496 --> 00:36:06,897
I was a powerless
and helpless boy.

674
00:36:06,899 --> 00:36:10,534
Until a local <i> sensei</i>
took me under his wing.

675
00:36:10,536 --> 00:36:12,636
And he saved me.

676
00:36:12,638 --> 00:36:14,878
Taught me lessons that I
later shared with your father.

677
00:36:15,273 --> 00:36:17,674
Ninth-century Japan.

678
00:36:17,676 --> 00:36:20,343
An evil warlord
ruled the land.

679
00:36:20,345 --> 00:36:23,847
He poisoned the water supply,
bringing on the dark ages.

680
00:36:23,849 --> 00:36:26,616
Death and disease
and suffering ran rampant.

681
00:36:26,618 --> 00:36:28,652
Not unlike the Foot Clan

682
00:36:28,654 --> 00:36:30,520
and what they'd like to do
to our city.

683
00:36:30,522 --> 00:36:33,823
Then one day, a hero arose.

684
00:36:33,825 --> 00:36:36,760
A great alchemist
discovered the antidote

685
00:36:36,762 --> 00:36:38,428
to the warlord's poison.

686
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:39,829
The cure-all

687
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:43,567
for his evil.

688
00:36:43,569 --> 00:36:45,850
Your father and I were trying
to recreate that cure-all.

689
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:48,371
We developed a mutagen

690
00:36:48,373 --> 00:36:50,540
capable of stimulating
self-repair

691
00:36:50,975 --> 00:36:52,676
on a cellular level.

692
00:36:54,645 --> 00:36:56,845
What were you
going to do with it?

693
00:36:59,984 --> 00:37:01,818
Imagine New York City,

694
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:06,256
being victim
to a chemical attack.

695
00:37:06,258 --> 00:37:10,360
This mutagen would be able
to reverse its effects.

696
00:37:10,362 --> 00:37:12,762
It would save the city,
it would save the people.

697
00:37:12,764 --> 00:37:16,399
Those test subjects,
those turtles...

698
00:37:16,401 --> 00:37:18,401
Running in their blood

699
00:37:18,403 --> 00:37:21,905
is the last
of this precious mutagen.

700
00:37:21,907 --> 00:37:24,147
And up until
a few moments ago,

701
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:28,245
I thought we failed.

702
00:37:28,247 --> 00:37:30,727
I thought they died
in the fire. How...

703
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:32,822
How could they have lived?

704
00:37:33,351 --> 00:37:35,619
Because I saved them.

705
00:37:36,988 --> 00:37:38,455
Of course you did.

706
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:43,326
April, the mutagen
possesses powers

707
00:37:45,463 --> 00:37:48,898
beyond our wildest hopes.

708
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:50,900
Whatever resources you need,

709
00:37:52,003 --> 00:37:53,370
I'm here.

710
00:37:55,373 --> 00:37:57,741
Let's work together.
We'll find them.

711
00:37:57,743 --> 00:38:00,043
The course of human history
may depend on it.

712
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:03,280
I'll show you out.

713
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:18,762
<i>Bam! You've been hacked!</i>

714
00:38:18,764 --> 00:38:20,563
<i>By Donatello. Remember me?</i>

715
00:38:20,565 --> 00:38:22,999
<i>Turtle. Four eyes.
But enough about me.</i>

716
00:38:23,001 --> 00:38:25,302
<i>We told you we'd find you.
Meet us here.</i>

717
00:38:25,304 --> 00:38:27,704
<i>And come alone.
Or... Or else we're...</i>

718
00:38:27,706 --> 00:38:30,507
<i>You shall be punished
and stuff.</i>

719
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:44,554
Hello?

720
00:38:46,757 --> 00:38:48,558
You told me to come here.

721
00:38:49,527 --> 00:38:50,760
I didn't bring anyone with me.

722
00:38:50,762 --> 00:38:51,795
I did exactly...

723
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:55,598
Okay! Are you April O'Neil?

724
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,033
Initiating retinal scan.

725
00:38:57,035 --> 00:38:59,069
Scanning, scanning,
scanning, scanning.

726
00:38:59,071 --> 00:39:01,338
Scan complete. It's her.
It's her. Guys, it's her!

727
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:03,039
Of course it's her, Donnie.

728
00:39:03,041 --> 00:39:06,042
Hey.
Really glad you could make it.

729
00:39:06,044 --> 00:39:07,744
Hey. There's someone important

730
00:39:07,746 --> 00:39:09,646
we want to introduce you to,
but first...

731
00:39:11,949 --> 00:39:14,451
Aw, yeah,
welcome to my crib, girl.

732
00:39:14,453 --> 00:39:15,719
Where are we?

733
00:39:15,721 --> 00:39:16,653
Hey,
it's our Fortress of Solitude.

734
00:39:16,655 --> 00:39:17,754
Our Hogwarts.

735
00:39:17,756 --> 00:39:18,988
Our Xavier Academy.

736
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:21,791
State-of-the-art WonderDome!

737
00:39:21,793 --> 00:39:22,992
Ugh.

738
00:39:22,994 --> 00:39:24,461
Are we in the sewer?

739
00:39:24,463 --> 00:39:26,129
No.

740
00:39:26,131 --> 00:39:27,497
- Technically, yes.
- Yeah.

741
00:39:27,499 --> 00:39:28,865
Yeah, it's a sewer.

742
00:39:30,067 --> 00:39:31,468
You brought us here, April.

743
00:39:38,409 --> 00:39:39,876
Splinter?

744
00:39:39,878 --> 00:39:40,810
How does she know his name?

745
00:39:40,812 --> 00:39:42,045
Did you tell her his name?

746
00:39:42,047 --> 00:39:42,946
Maybe she's clairvoyant.

747
00:39:42,948 --> 00:39:44,188
Maybe she's a Jedi!

748
00:39:46,751 --> 00:39:48,017
Come closer.

749
00:39:55,659 --> 00:39:57,494
It's been a long time.

750
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:01,531
Mmm.

751
00:40:01,533 --> 00:40:04,434
You always did have
your father's eyes.

752
00:40:06,771 --> 00:40:09,005
I don't understand.

753
00:40:09,007 --> 00:40:12,509
Don't be afraid.
All will be made clear.

754
00:40:13,144 --> 00:40:15,178
This is crazy.

755
00:40:51,015 --> 00:40:52,749
There's been a miracle.

756
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:58,955
The vigilantes who've been
causing us so much trouble?

757
00:41:01,492 --> 00:41:03,493
They're the test subjects.

758
00:41:05,563 --> 00:41:07,730
Those itty-bitty box turtles

759
00:41:07,732 --> 00:41:10,013
that we thought
we lost in the fire?

760
00:41:12,837 --> 00:41:15,237
They're alive,
Master Shredder.

761
00:41:15,739 --> 00:41:18,508
And they've grown
into something

762
00:41:19,009 --> 00:41:20,176
powerful.

763
00:41:22,847 --> 00:41:25,715
It won't be easy to capture
them, but if we can,

764
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:28,051
we can finally
carry out the plan

765
00:41:28,053 --> 00:41:30,093
that we had
all those years ago.

766
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:36,993
The city will be ours.

767
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:46,135
O'Neil's daughter
was the one who found them

768
00:41:46,137 --> 00:41:48,705
and she will be the one who
will take us right to them.

769
00:41:55,946 --> 00:41:57,213
There's the ping.

770
00:41:57,215 --> 00:41:58,735
We've breached
the cloaking security.

771
00:42:09,994 --> 00:42:11,794
<i>Listen closely, April.</i>

772
00:42:12,897 --> 00:42:15,064
I don't remember a time

773
00:42:15,066 --> 00:42:17,901
before living
in that laboratory.

774
00:42:17,903 --> 00:42:20,803
That fateful night
started like any other.

775
00:42:21,639 --> 00:42:24,607
<i>Sacks gave us our injections.</i>

776
00:42:24,609 --> 00:42:27,176
<i>Your father made sure
our vital signs were strong.</i>

777
00:42:28,245 --> 00:42:30,246
<i>And you, as always,</i>

778
00:42:30,248 --> 00:42:33,283
<i>provided us
with a special treat.</i>

779
00:42:33,285 --> 00:42:35,685
<i>After the brothers
went to sleep,</i>

780
00:42:35,687 --> 00:42:37,921
<i>I heard loud voices.</i>

781
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:45,962
<i>There was the smell of smoke.</i>

782
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:48,765
<i>Alarms sounded.</i>

783
00:42:48,767 --> 00:42:50,900
<i>Your father
had discovered the truth</i>

784
00:42:50,902 --> 00:42:53,269
<i>behind the man
he was working for.</i>

785
00:42:53,271 --> 00:42:54,837
<i>He set fire to the lab.</i>

786
00:42:55,773 --> 00:42:58,007
<i>His last breath was taken</i>

787
00:42:58,009 --> 00:43:00,677
<i>trying to destroy
Shredder's plan.</i>

788
00:43:00,679 --> 00:43:02,745
<i>I was terrified.</i>

789
00:43:02,747 --> 00:43:04,581
<i>But then, you appeared.</i>

790
00:43:08,986 --> 00:43:12,722
<i>And ushered us to safety.</i>

791
00:43:12,724 --> 00:43:14,791
<i>I never had a voice then,</i>

792
00:43:15,726 --> 00:43:19,095
<i>but I thank you now, April.</i>

793
00:43:20,130 --> 00:43:21,130
Mmm.

794
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:28,004
We wandered the sewers
until I found this place.

795
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:31,808
<i>It was then that the mutagen</i>

796
00:43:31,810 --> 00:43:33,876
<i>that was injected
into our blood</i>

797
00:43:33,878 --> 00:43:37,080
<i>began to change us
in miraculous ways.</i>

798
00:43:38,082 --> 00:43:41,818
<i>I saw how your father loved you</i>

799
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:45,021
<i>and I knew I had to show
that same love to the turtles.</i>

800
00:43:45,756 --> 00:43:47,824
<i>I became their father</i>

801
00:43:48,359 --> 00:43:50,893
<i>and they became my sons.</i>

802
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:54,697
<i>Like all children,
they were drawn</i>

803
00:43:54,699 --> 00:43:57,367
<i>to the distractions
of popular culture.</i>

804
00:43:57,369 --> 00:44:01,237
<i>They would want
to explore the world above.</i>

805
00:44:11,382 --> 00:44:13,683
<i>They would be ridiculed.</i>

806
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:18,321
They would need to learn
to protect themselves,

807
00:44:18,323 --> 00:44:21,290
both mentally and physically.

808
00:44:21,292 --> 00:44:22,892
Hey. Does anyone
want to play Buck-Buck?

809
00:44:23,394 --> 00:44:24,394
Buck one!

810
00:44:24,862 --> 00:44:26,062
Buck two!

811
00:44:26,064 --> 00:44:27,363
Buck three!

812
00:44:27,365 --> 00:44:29,165
Where you going, Raph?

813
00:44:29,167 --> 00:44:30,133
Come on.
I can't do it by myself.

814
00:44:30,135 --> 00:44:31,434
I need all four!

815
00:44:31,436 --> 00:44:33,169
You're a Buck short.

816
00:44:33,171 --> 00:44:36,773
Yeah, that sounds
stupid. Like you, Mikey!

817
00:44:36,775 --> 00:44:38,941
That's why you're just
the hype man, bra.

818
00:44:38,943 --> 00:44:40,543
- See these moves?
- Yeah, whatever, man.

819
00:44:46,283 --> 00:44:49,018
<i>And then I found a way.</i>

820
00:44:51,856 --> 00:44:54,991
<i>First, I would teach myself
the ancient art of Ninjutsu.</i>

821
00:44:59,830 --> 00:45:00,830
Oh!

822
00:45:05,035 --> 00:45:07,437
<i>The brothers
followed my lead,</i>

823
00:45:07,439 --> 00:45:09,906
<i>accelerating
at a wondrous rate!</i>

824
00:45:16,413 --> 00:45:18,114
Wassup, bra?
Want some of this?

825
00:45:18,116 --> 00:45:19,882
I'm like a ghost!

826
00:45:19,884 --> 00:45:22,251
I'm over here, now I'm over
here, bra. Like a shadow!

827
00:45:22,253 --> 00:45:24,153
I'm a flame
shadow fire dragon!

828
00:45:24,155 --> 00:45:27,056
Ow!

829
00:45:27,058 --> 00:45:30,193
<i>Their gift
was also their passion.</i>

830
00:45:30,195 --> 00:45:32,295
<i>They lived,
breathed and dreamed</i>

831
00:45:32,297 --> 00:45:33,963
<i>all things martial arts.</i>

832
00:45:48,345 --> 00:45:49,812
<i>Then,</i>

833
00:45:49,814 --> 00:45:50,947
<i>they were ready.</i>

834
00:45:52,449 --> 00:45:56,185
The katana,
most noble of all the blades.

835
00:45:56,187 --> 00:45:58,087
It is the weapon of a leader.

836
00:46:05,829 --> 00:46:07,797
<i>Everything they are,</i>

837
00:46:07,799 --> 00:46:11,501
<i>and everything
that they've become</i>

838
00:46:11,503 --> 00:46:14,504
<i>was made possible
by the bravery that</i>

839
00:46:14,506 --> 00:46:17,406
<i>you displayed
on that fateful night.</i>

840
00:46:19,309 --> 00:46:20,409
Dude.

841
00:46:22,546 --> 00:46:24,180
I was just a little girl.

842
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:28,551
And you gave us freedom

843
00:46:28,553 --> 00:46:30,820
where others
would have kept us in cages.

844
00:46:30,822 --> 00:46:32,388
Wait a minute, Dad.

845
00:46:32,390 --> 00:46:34,490
All these years you told us we
were rescued from the fire

846
00:46:34,492 --> 00:46:37,160
by a great guardian spirit,
the <i> Hogo-sha.</i>

847
00:46:37,928 --> 00:46:39,529
That's right.

848
00:46:39,531 --> 00:46:42,365
And this is the <i> Hogo-sha.</i>

849
00:46:44,034 --> 00:46:45,434
What?

850
00:46:57,915 --> 00:46:59,916
My girlfriend's totally
the <i> Hogo-sha.</i>

851
00:46:59,918 --> 00:47:01,050
Ow.

852
00:47:04,321 --> 00:47:05,922
Fortunately, our engineers

853
00:47:05,924 --> 00:47:07,890
have been making
great progress

854
00:47:07,892 --> 00:47:10,259
in refining the robotics
in your armor.

855
00:47:10,261 --> 00:47:12,395
We're taking it
to the next level,

856
00:47:12,397 --> 00:47:14,517
bridging the gap
between ancient tradition

857
00:47:15,866 --> 00:47:17,300
and modern warfare.

858
00:47:28,278 --> 00:47:29,946
Why did you bring me here?

859
00:47:29,948 --> 00:47:33,549
To find out who you told
of our existence.

860
00:47:33,551 --> 00:47:37,253
Nobody that believed me,
except for Eric Sacks.

861
00:47:39,057 --> 00:47:40,389
Sacks.

862
00:47:41,325 --> 00:47:42,959
Just as I feared.

863
00:47:44,228 --> 00:47:46,596
Sacks is not a friend.

864
00:47:48,065 --> 00:47:50,333
His soul has been poisoned

865
00:47:50,335 --> 00:47:51,868
by the influence
of a dark master.

866
00:47:53,237 --> 00:47:55,938
The Shredder.

867
00:47:55,940 --> 00:47:59,342
Shredder practically
raised Sacks in Japan.

868
00:47:59,344 --> 00:48:01,544
He's like a father to him.

869
00:48:01,546 --> 00:48:03,613
Sacks will do anything
for his master.

870
00:48:03,615 --> 00:48:05,581
Wait, wait.

871
00:48:05,583 --> 00:48:07,650
Sacks and Shredder?

872
00:48:07,652 --> 00:48:09,252
So, why aren't we out there
hunting them down?

873
00:48:09,254 --> 00:48:10,586
Because, Raphael,

874
00:48:10,588 --> 00:48:13,356
The Shredder
is a skilled warrior

875
00:48:13,358 --> 00:48:16,158
whose cruelty
is ever-reaching!

876
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:18,961
And you are just teenagers.

877
00:48:20,932 --> 00:48:24,400
The mutagen in your blood
is of great value to them.

878
00:48:26,003 --> 00:48:27,470
Now that Sacks
has confirmation

879
00:48:27,472 --> 00:48:30,673
that you are alive,

880
00:48:30,675 --> 00:48:33,609
I fear they will bring
the fight to us.

881
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:35,912
Oh, no.

882
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:41,563
Stand by
to make entry. Let's move!

883
00:48:42,486 --> 00:48:43,653
Go, go, go!

884
00:48:50,194 --> 00:48:52,361
Perimeter infringe.
Breached! We have incoming!

885
00:48:56,633 --> 00:48:58,567
Oh, no! Oh, no!
We got two breaches.

886
00:48:58,569 --> 00:49:00,536
Fan room, weapons wall!

887
00:49:00,538 --> 00:49:02,104
Mikey, flank right!
Donnie, on me!

888
00:49:02,106 --> 00:49:03,146
We gotta go! Go, go!

889
00:49:04,207 --> 00:49:05,675
Stand by to set charge.

890
00:49:08,245 --> 00:49:10,085
Lock and load.
We're going on 10.

891
00:49:13,984 --> 00:49:15,952
No live ammo. Tranqs only.

892
00:49:15,954 --> 00:49:16,954
Take 'em alive!

893
00:49:17,454 --> 00:49:18,688
No! Get back!

894
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:23,260
Donnie!

895
00:49:35,072 --> 00:49:36,072
Engage!

896
00:49:39,142 --> 00:49:40,309
Get him!

897
00:49:45,716 --> 00:49:48,017
There they are!
Neutralize them!

898
00:49:48,019 --> 00:49:49,418
They've got tranq darts!

899
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:50,780
Well, don't let them
hit your skin.

900
00:49:51,188 --> 00:49:52,388
Let's go! Let's move!

901
00:49:59,629 --> 00:50:00,696
Over there!

902
00:50:00,698 --> 00:50:02,999
Tango at 12!

903
00:50:03,001 --> 00:50:05,601
Wassup, bra? Oh, you think
you can handle this, huh?

904
00:50:05,603 --> 00:50:07,670
I'm a snapping turtle, fool.
Snap, snap, snap!

905
00:50:10,307 --> 00:50:12,387
I meant to do that!
I meant to do it!

906
00:50:21,685 --> 00:50:22,651
We got a breach
in the fan room!

907
00:50:22,653 --> 00:50:24,220
Raph! Get to the fan room!

908
00:50:24,222 --> 00:50:27,490
Why are you always telling me
what to do?

909
00:50:27,492 --> 00:50:30,659
Just go! Mikey, you gotta get
April out of here, now!

910
00:50:30,661 --> 00:50:32,061
I got this!

911
00:50:36,099 --> 00:50:37,366
April, come with me.

912
00:50:37,368 --> 00:50:38,434
I got a safe place
for you to hide.

913
00:50:38,436 --> 00:50:40,069
And if you get thirsty,

914
00:50:40,071 --> 00:50:42,605
I got a secret stash of Orange
Crush behind the fridge.

915
00:50:42,607 --> 00:50:43,647
Don't tell Raph.

916
00:50:53,383 --> 00:50:54,817
Shredder.

917
00:50:59,589 --> 00:51:01,724
All these years

918
00:51:01,726 --> 00:51:04,360
I've been trying
to recreate the mutagen.

919
00:51:04,628 --> 00:51:05,828
And you?

920
00:51:06,663 --> 00:51:08,497
You just handed it to me.

921
00:51:11,501 --> 00:51:15,171
You will not lay a hand
on my sons.

922
00:51:21,279 --> 00:51:22,812
Your sons?

923
00:51:26,249 --> 00:51:27,683
You think you're their father?

924
00:51:34,191 --> 00:51:36,192
Very good, rat!

925
00:52:50,867 --> 00:52:52,234
<i>Sensei!</i>

926
00:52:58,208 --> 00:52:59,208
Donnie!

927
00:53:00,677 --> 00:53:02,811
Hang on, Leo! Be right there!

928
00:53:24,334 --> 00:53:25,768
You stupid little girl!

929
00:53:25,936 --> 00:53:26,969
April!

930
00:53:47,891 --> 00:53:49,258
<i>Sensei!</i>

931
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:50,726
No, my son, stay back!

932
00:54:00,737 --> 00:54:01,937
<i>Sensei!</i>

933
00:54:07,811 --> 00:54:09,411
<i>Sensei!</i> Dad!

934
00:54:09,413 --> 00:54:10,379
Dad! What are you...
What are you doing?

935
00:54:10,381 --> 00:54:11,680
Hide!

936
00:54:13,950 --> 00:54:15,451
No!

937
00:54:15,453 --> 00:54:16,619
Save yourselves!

938
00:54:44,414 --> 00:54:46,982
Children, drop your weapons,

939
00:54:46,984 --> 00:54:50,719
or your father will die.

940
00:55:14,545 --> 00:55:16,078
No!

941
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:17,379
No!

942
00:55:35,598 --> 00:55:37,032
Where's the fourth?

943
00:55:37,034 --> 00:55:39,335
He's dead.

944
00:55:39,337 --> 00:55:40,402
Destroy this place.

945
00:55:48,411 --> 00:55:49,745
Keep moving!

946
00:55:52,515 --> 00:55:54,450
Stay strong.

947
00:55:54,452 --> 00:55:57,619
Remember,
pain's only in the mind.

948
00:56:09,366 --> 00:56:11,033
Move along! Go!

949
00:56:13,737 --> 00:56:14,770
Troop, go!

950
00:56:15,138 --> 00:56:16,472
Move! Move!

951
00:56:45,402 --> 00:56:46,535
Splinter.

952
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:18,567
<i>Sensei.</i>

953
00:57:19,502 --> 00:57:20,569
Master.

954
00:57:24,641 --> 00:57:26,161
Let's get him
to the needle room.

955
00:57:33,783 --> 00:57:35,717
Package is secured. En route.

956
00:57:35,719 --> 00:57:38,954
<i>In approximately 40 minutes.</i>

957
00:57:41,825 --> 00:57:43,759
Prepare the containment units.

958
00:57:44,194 --> 00:57:46,028
Inside those turtles

959
00:57:46,030 --> 00:57:48,497
is the most precious
compound on Earth,

960
00:57:50,099 --> 00:57:51,800
mutagen.

961
00:57:51,802 --> 00:57:53,168
And we will drain every last

962
00:57:53,170 --> 00:57:55,003
ounce of their blood
to get it,

963
00:57:55,005 --> 00:57:56,638
even if it kills them.

964
00:57:58,241 --> 00:58:00,909
Get the first aid kit!
On the shelf!

965
00:58:04,147 --> 00:58:05,914
Hurry. Hurry.

966
00:58:12,589 --> 00:58:13,789
Raphael?

967
00:58:14,858 --> 00:58:16,058
I'm here.

968
00:58:18,628 --> 00:58:20,662
You must save your brothers.

969
00:58:21,531 --> 00:58:23,031
Stop Shredder.

970
00:58:23,733 --> 00:58:25,100
<i>Sensei.</i>

971
00:58:32,609 --> 00:58:34,042
It's some kind of tracker.

972
00:58:34,044 --> 00:58:35,277
It's Donatello!

973
00:58:36,279 --> 00:58:37,946
Go, Raphael.

974
00:58:39,115 --> 00:58:40,616
Let's go save my brothers.

975
00:58:54,764 --> 00:58:56,031
We need a ride.

976
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:05,841
O'Neil!

977
00:59:05,843 --> 00:59:07,109
<i>Look, Vern,
I need you to meet me</i>

978
00:59:07,111 --> 00:59:09,044
at Cortlandt Alley
in 10 minutes, please.

979
00:59:09,046 --> 00:59:10,679
Wait, why?

980
00:59:10,681 --> 00:59:12,247
<i>I can't talk to you about it
on the phone.</i>

981
00:59:12,249 --> 00:59:13,982
<i>Just promise
you're gonna be there.</i>

982
00:59:13,984 --> 00:59:15,017
What do you mean, you can't
talk about... You called...

983
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:17,120
...me.

984
00:59:22,593 --> 00:59:24,833
All right. Want me
to meet you right now?

985
00:59:26,162 --> 00:59:28,096
I'll play your little game.

986
00:59:38,274 --> 00:59:39,575
What's with the hat?

987
00:59:39,577 --> 00:59:40,676
What is with the...

988
00:59:40,678 --> 00:59:41,944
I don't know,

989
00:59:41,946 --> 00:59:44,212
it's a buddy of mine's.
It's just a goof.

990
00:59:44,214 --> 00:59:46,248
What do you want to do?
You wanna head downtown?

991
00:59:46,250 --> 00:59:48,083
Eric Sacks is working with
the head of the Foot Clan.

992
00:59:48,085 --> 00:59:49,585
They just kidnapped
the vigilante turtles

993
00:59:49,587 --> 00:59:50,686
to take them
to the Sacks estate.

994
00:59:50,688 --> 00:59:52,120
We need to go. Come on, Vern.

995
00:59:52,122 --> 00:59:55,891
Right, right, right.
The turtles. I forgot.

996
00:59:55,893 --> 00:59:58,961
This is getting
embarrassing. O'Neil,

997
00:59:58,963 --> 01:00:01,296
we're both consenting adults.

998
01:00:01,298 --> 01:00:04,633
We're both very good-looking.
You're better, probably.

999
01:00:04,635 --> 01:00:06,001
That's up for debate.

1000
01:00:06,003 --> 01:00:08,070
But the point is, we don't
need to make up excuses

1001
01:00:08,072 --> 01:00:09,938
to hang out with each other.
What?

1002
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:11,873
You want to spend more time
with me. I get it.
I would too.

1003
01:00:11,875 --> 01:00:12,941
We need to get to
the Sacks estate

1004
01:00:12,943 --> 01:00:14,142
right now, Vern. Come on!

1005
01:00:14,144 --> 01:00:16,612
"The Sacks estate
with the vigilante..."

1006
01:00:16,614 --> 01:00:18,574
What...
Drive!

1007
01:00:24,153 --> 01:00:26,154
You're a talking turtle.

1008
01:00:26,156 --> 01:00:28,223
Yeah. Yeah,
I'm a talking turtle

1009
01:00:28,225 --> 01:00:30,058
and you're a human nerd.

1010
01:00:30,060 --> 01:00:31,860
Now that we got that
out of the way, hit it.

1011
01:00:36,933 --> 01:00:39,101
I've never been accused
of being a nerd before, but...

1012
01:00:39,103 --> 01:00:41,970
I'm sorry...

1013
01:00:41,972 --> 01:00:44,332
How did you get in...
How did he get in the...

1014
01:01:03,226 --> 01:01:04,326
Oh, my.

1015
01:01:06,195 --> 01:01:07,896
Wow.

1016
01:01:07,898 --> 01:01:10,165
Unbelievable.
Let me look at you.

1017
01:01:12,001 --> 01:01:13,802
I'm a hard guy
to impress, but...

1018
01:01:15,204 --> 01:01:17,439
This is just...
Oh, my God.

1019
01:01:19,108 --> 01:01:20,175
Wow!

1020
01:01:21,744 --> 01:01:23,812
And we were gonna use rabbits!

1021
01:01:23,814 --> 01:01:26,682
Can you imagine that?
All we were trying to do

1022
01:01:26,684 --> 01:01:28,917
is create an antidote.

1023
01:01:31,220 --> 01:01:32,320
For what?

1024
01:01:34,424 --> 01:01:36,144
Say that again.
I want to hear your voice.

1025
01:01:36,693 --> 01:01:37,793
For what?

1026
01:01:38,194 --> 01:01:39,895
Wow.

1027
01:01:39,897 --> 01:01:42,230
Well, uh, we had this plan.

1028
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:47,803
A plan that we're ready
to put back online today.

1029
01:01:49,806 --> 01:01:52,307
I'll show you. Karai, um...

1030
01:01:52,309 --> 01:01:53,375
Show them.

1031
01:01:55,879 --> 01:01:57,713
What?

1032
01:01:57,715 --> 01:01:59,147
Do you know my building,
Sacks Tower?

1033
01:01:59,149 --> 01:02:01,450
Got that great big
spire up on top?

1034
01:02:01,452 --> 01:02:04,352
That spire is filled...

1035
01:02:04,354 --> 01:02:06,254
...with tons
of chemical toxins.

1036
01:02:06,256 --> 01:02:07,456
No! No!

1037
01:02:09,193 --> 01:02:10,358
Bad stuff.

1038
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:11,993
That kinda bad.

1039
01:02:16,065 --> 01:02:17,766
In a few hours,

1040
01:02:17,768 --> 01:02:21,203
Shredder is going to unleash
all that stuff

1041
01:02:21,205 --> 01:02:24,840
over the whole city.
The initial death toll

1042
01:02:24,842 --> 01:02:26,875
will shake world governments
to their core.

1043
01:02:27,310 --> 01:02:29,044
In 30 days,

1044
01:02:29,046 --> 01:02:31,480
the city of New York
will be a quarantine zone.

1045
01:02:33,816 --> 01:02:36,384
And that is where
my company comes in.

1046
01:02:39,188 --> 01:02:42,824
I'm going to save everyone
with the antidote

1047
01:02:42,826 --> 01:02:44,526
that is made from the mutagen

1048
01:02:44,528 --> 01:02:48,230
that is oozing
through your blood.

1049
01:02:48,232 --> 01:02:53,201
The government will then send
Sacks Industry a blank check

1050
01:02:53,203 --> 01:02:56,505
and I'm going to be rich.
Like, stupid rich.

1051
01:02:58,341 --> 01:03:02,177
Shredder will force this city
to live under our rule.

1052
01:03:05,014 --> 01:03:07,048
We will be gods.

1053
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:12,120
Yeah,
I've thought about...

1054
01:03:12,122 --> 01:03:16,458
not becoming a ninja, but
I was doing a bunch of yoga

1055
01:03:16,460 --> 01:03:19,861
for like, 10 days
at one point, and, uh,
I pulled a hamstring.

1056
01:03:19,863 --> 01:03:22,223
There's the gate right there.
There it is.

1057
01:03:23,833 --> 01:03:25,300
Ram the gate.

1058
01:03:25,302 --> 01:03:27,269
"Ram the gate"?
This is Channel 6 property.

1059
01:03:27,271 --> 01:03:29,404
I said ram the gate!

1060
01:03:29,406 --> 01:03:31,486
All right,
everybody, strap in!

1061
01:03:35,878 --> 01:03:37,078
Oh, shit!

1062
01:03:37,080 --> 01:03:38,080
Go, go, go, go!

1063
01:03:57,934 --> 01:03:58,934
Follow me!

1064
01:04:04,274 --> 01:04:05,607
I'll take this canister
to New York

1065
01:04:05,609 --> 01:04:07,375
to withdraw the mutagen.

1066
01:04:07,377 --> 01:04:09,477
Make sure that
you drain all their blood.

1067
01:04:12,315 --> 01:04:13,995
Time to take a bite
out of the Big Apple.

1068
01:04:26,964 --> 01:04:28,096
Hey!
Get out of here!

1069
01:04:30,499 --> 01:04:31,633
Leo!

1070
01:04:38,374 --> 01:04:39,975
About time.

1071
01:04:43,512 --> 01:04:44,512
What the...

1072
01:04:45,514 --> 01:04:46,514
Raphael.

1073
01:04:48,317 --> 01:04:49,651
Glad you could join us.

1074
01:04:51,388 --> 01:04:54,055
The fourth cage is for you.

1075
01:05:05,268 --> 01:05:06,401
That's harsh, man.

1076
01:05:27,189 --> 01:05:30,058
The rat did not
teach you well!

1077
01:05:31,994 --> 01:05:33,228
Raphael!

1078
01:05:33,362 --> 01:05:35,196
You.

1079
01:05:35,198 --> 01:05:36,431
Focus on me.

1080
01:05:42,605 --> 01:05:45,340
Three... Four total turtles.

1081
01:05:45,342 --> 01:05:47,382
One's fighting
a robot samurai. Why not?

1082
01:05:54,550 --> 01:05:55,630
Donnie!

1083
01:05:59,722 --> 01:06:00,722
Donnie!

1084
01:06:03,092 --> 01:06:04,452
Adrenaline.
What?

1085
01:06:04,994 --> 01:06:06,194
Adrenaline.

1086
01:06:07,563 --> 01:06:08,730
Adrenaline.

1087
01:06:10,566 --> 01:06:11,806
All right. All right.

1088
01:06:16,472 --> 01:06:17,639
Adrenaline.

1089
01:06:26,382 --> 01:06:28,416
He's going to kill him.

1090
01:06:34,657 --> 01:06:35,991
Get up!

1091
01:06:42,365 --> 01:06:43,598
It's working.

1092
01:06:55,578 --> 01:06:57,312
I think we should move.

1093
01:07:11,060 --> 01:07:14,029
Oh! I feel really good right
now! I feel like running!

1094
01:07:14,031 --> 01:07:15,463
I feel like cleaning!
Who wants to clean the dojo?

1095
01:07:15,465 --> 01:07:17,198
I'll clean the dojo!

1096
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:18,533
Endorphins! Endorphins!

1097
01:07:18,535 --> 01:07:19,535
We got to get Raph!

1098
01:07:19,536 --> 01:07:20,568
Raph! Raph!

1099
01:07:21,471 --> 01:07:25,707
Are you okay?
Are you dead? Are you okay?

1100
01:07:27,076 --> 01:07:29,110
Come on. Come on.

1101
01:07:29,112 --> 01:07:31,246
- Go where?
- Sacks Tower!

1102
01:07:31,248 --> 01:07:32,414
New York City! Times Square!

1103
01:07:32,416 --> 01:07:33,648
Shredder's going to
release a toxin!

1104
01:07:33,650 --> 01:07:34,716
It's gonna poison
the whole city!

1105
01:07:34,718 --> 01:07:36,551
And Sacks is gonna
sell the antidote!

1106
01:07:36,553 --> 01:07:39,554
That's in our blood!
So we've got
to get going now!

1107
01:07:39,556 --> 01:07:41,589
Good. Let's do it for <i> sensei.</i>

1108
01:07:41,591 --> 01:07:43,058
Okay.
We're going!

1109
01:07:43,060 --> 01:07:45,660
Everybody calm down!
Look how calm I am!

1110
01:07:49,598 --> 01:07:50,698
We got to move.
Let's go!

1111
01:07:52,601 --> 01:07:54,602
Sacks is airborne!

1112
01:07:54,604 --> 01:07:56,104
Flight time to Manhattan,
19 minutes!

1113
01:07:56,106 --> 01:07:57,572
Get us out of here, Donnie!

1114
01:08:04,380 --> 01:08:06,247
Oh, my gosh, they have guns!

1115
01:08:06,249 --> 01:08:07,615
Get down!

1116
01:08:15,357 --> 01:08:17,125
Ha! Are you guys okay?

1117
01:08:17,127 --> 01:08:18,293
We're bulletproof.

1118
01:08:18,295 --> 01:08:19,661
Sweet!

1119
01:08:19,663 --> 01:08:21,096
Advance and engage!

1120
01:08:22,532 --> 01:08:23,431
Can you drive that truck?

1121
01:08:23,433 --> 01:08:24,699
Yeah!

1122
01:08:24,701 --> 01:08:26,534
We're on Raph. Ready?

1123
01:08:47,356 --> 01:08:48,356
Come on!

1124
01:08:50,392 --> 01:08:53,228
Everybody in the truck!
We gotta go, go, go! Move!

1125
01:08:54,396 --> 01:08:55,864
Vern, you know
how to drive this, right?

1126
01:08:55,866 --> 01:08:57,832
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just got to
hotwire this thing, I guess.

1127
01:08:57,834 --> 01:08:59,501
Classic
blue wire/red wire situation.

1128
01:08:59,503 --> 01:09:00,802
Keys!
Yeah.

1129
01:09:00,804 --> 01:09:02,137
Keys are better.

1130
01:09:02,771 --> 01:09:04,571
Drive!
I'm on it!

1131
01:09:05,308 --> 01:09:08,508
That's all I need is a
backseat-driving
talking turtle!

1132
01:09:17,820 --> 01:09:19,154
- Let's go!
- Move!

1133
01:09:24,660 --> 01:09:26,828
- Jackal-One-Tango, on your 12!
- <i> Copy that.</i>

1134
01:09:26,830 --> 01:09:28,663
I shouldn't have doubted you.

1135
01:09:28,665 --> 01:09:30,532
Sorry I didn't
stick up for you.

1136
01:09:30,534 --> 01:09:32,934
I can't believe that you're
not crazy! How crazy is that?

1137
01:09:39,876 --> 01:09:41,476
Target, 12 o'clock!

1138
01:09:41,478 --> 01:09:42,944
Where are we going, guys?

1139
01:09:42,946 --> 01:09:44,712
Donnie, what's the fastest
way back to Manhattan?

1140
01:09:44,714 --> 01:09:45,880
We just need
to stay on this road.

1141
01:09:45,882 --> 01:09:46,848
If we can get to
the maintenance hatch

1142
01:09:46,850 --> 01:09:48,349
at the bottom of the hill,

1143
01:09:48,351 --> 01:09:49,851
there's a sewer line
2.4 miles from here.

1144
01:09:49,853 --> 01:09:51,686
Mikey! Let them know up there!

1145
01:09:52,188 --> 01:09:53,388
I'm on it!

1146
01:09:55,791 --> 01:09:56,958
Oh, no.

1147
01:10:26,288 --> 01:10:27,255
Vern, go, go, go, go, go!

1148
01:10:27,257 --> 01:10:28,389
I'm on it!

1149
01:10:28,391 --> 01:10:29,391
Stop!

1150
01:10:32,494 --> 01:10:33,628
Vern, hit the brakes!

1151
01:10:33,630 --> 01:10:34,630
Wrong way! Wrong way!

1152
01:10:35,364 --> 01:10:36,497
Go around! Go, go, go!

1153
01:10:36,832 --> 01:10:37,932
Leo, move, move!

1154
01:10:37,934 --> 01:10:38,934
What?

1155
01:10:41,938 --> 01:10:43,098
Opposite,
opposite, opposite!

1156
01:10:43,672 --> 01:10:45,340
Oh, no!

1157
01:10:48,577 --> 01:10:50,645
How far off course are we?

1158
01:10:50,647 --> 01:10:52,447
Actually, we're on
a bit of a shortcut.

1159
01:10:52,449 --> 01:10:53,781
But we need
to keep going down.

1160
01:10:53,783 --> 01:10:55,023
Straight down.

1161
01:10:55,684 --> 01:10:56,951
Hey!

1162
01:10:56,953 --> 01:10:58,386
Just keep

1163
01:10:59,321 --> 01:11:01,356
going straight!

1164
01:11:02,558 --> 01:11:04,025
What's up, angel cakes?

1165
01:11:16,372 --> 01:11:17,372
Fire!

1166
01:11:32,422 --> 01:11:35,023
Guys, Leo's in trouble!

1167
01:11:35,025 --> 01:11:37,659
My shell's cracked.
Just tape it up.

1168
01:11:37,661 --> 01:11:39,861
Allow me to be
the bad-ass for once.

1169
01:11:46,368 --> 01:11:48,403
Hang on, Leo. Disengaging.

1170
01:11:51,974 --> 01:11:54,042
God, I've always wanted
to try this.

1171
01:12:09,425 --> 01:12:11,859
I got you, brother.
One car down, two to go.

1172
01:12:14,496 --> 01:12:16,030
Mikey!

1173
01:12:16,032 --> 01:12:19,000
All right, that's it.
I'll take it from here!

1174
01:12:19,535 --> 01:12:20,635
Whoo-hoo!

1175
01:12:25,107 --> 01:12:27,008
Raph, I'm driving!
Yeah!

1176
01:12:28,043 --> 01:12:29,644
Whoo-hoo!

1177
01:12:40,122 --> 01:12:41,856
O'Neil, what are you doing?

1178
01:12:43,526 --> 01:12:45,793
Yeah, that's good. Make sure
you're getting everything.

1179
01:12:56,505 --> 01:12:57,739
Vern!

1180
01:12:58,073 --> 01:12:59,941
Vern!

1181
01:12:59,943 --> 01:13:02,009
O'Neil! Give me your arm!

1182
01:13:02,678 --> 01:13:03,745
Vern!

1183
01:13:05,414 --> 01:13:07,515
Avalanche!

1184
01:13:08,851 --> 01:13:10,051
Whoa!

1185
01:13:18,927 --> 01:13:20,087
Come on,
Leo, wake up!

1186
01:13:20,729 --> 01:13:21,929
Yeah! If you wake up,

1187
01:13:21,931 --> 01:13:23,931
I promise to do
anything you say!

1188
01:13:24,833 --> 01:13:26,667
Guys! Shredder's chopper
is 20 miles

1189
01:13:26,669 --> 01:13:28,836
outside of New York City
airspace!

1190
01:13:28,838 --> 01:13:30,671
Thanks for
the traffic update, Donnie.

1191
01:13:30,673 --> 01:13:32,774
You doing sports
and weather next?

1192
01:13:32,776 --> 01:13:33,941
If you're gonna be
nasty about it

1193
01:13:33,943 --> 01:13:35,176
then I guess
you don't want to know

1194
01:13:35,178 --> 01:13:37,111
that there's a 500-foot
drop-off in 53 seconds!

1195
01:13:37,113 --> 01:13:38,045
Are you saying there's...

1196
01:13:38,047 --> 01:13:39,180
A cliff!

1197
01:13:40,950 --> 01:13:43,651
We gotta get April out
of there! Raph, heads up!

1198
01:13:45,587 --> 01:13:47,088
Don't forget that old guy!

1199
01:13:54,897 --> 01:13:57,498
Hi. Change of plans.
Oh, come on.

1200
01:13:57,500 --> 01:13:59,033
Guys, get down! Get down!

1201
01:14:07,876 --> 01:14:09,477
Twelve seconds
and we're going over!

1202
01:14:09,479 --> 01:14:12,046
Hey, Donnie,
do that fancy slingshot thing!

1203
01:14:12,048 --> 01:14:13,928
We got to take
Little Miss Sunshine out!

1204
01:14:14,049 --> 01:14:15,450
Batter up!

1205
01:14:27,963 --> 01:14:29,096
Grab on.

1206
01:14:41,877 --> 01:14:44,245
Mikey! Grab the cable!

1207
01:14:45,914 --> 01:14:47,748
I got it! I got it!

1208
01:14:52,020 --> 01:14:53,020
Hold on! Hold on!

1209
01:14:57,059 --> 01:14:58,926
Oh, no!

1210
01:14:59,695 --> 01:15:00,695
No, no, no!

1211
01:15:03,699 --> 01:15:05,032
Oh, no...

1212
01:15:05,034 --> 01:15:07,201
Poor Leo, April...

1213
01:15:07,203 --> 01:15:08,936
And that other guy.

1214
01:15:08,938 --> 01:15:11,072
They were so young,
so beautiful.

1215
01:15:11,074 --> 01:15:12,840
They ain't dead,
numb nuts.

1216
01:15:12,842 --> 01:15:13,875
Oh. Right on.

1217
01:15:18,514 --> 01:15:20,648
I hope you got a parachute
under that shell.

1218
01:15:20,650 --> 01:15:22,650
Hey, guys!
It's the maintenance hatch!

1219
01:15:22,652 --> 01:15:23,918
Our ticket home!

1220
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:26,287
A little help, please!

1221
01:15:26,289 --> 01:15:28,823
Guys, we gotta
hustle. Shredder's over
New York City!

1222
01:15:31,693 --> 01:15:33,373
Sensei,
<i>the mutagen is</i>
<i>four minutes out.</i>

1223
01:15:35,030 --> 01:15:37,164
<i>Moving forward as planned.</i>

1224
01:16:00,657 --> 01:16:01,622
Please keep your arms and legs

1225
01:16:01,624 --> 01:16:03,691
inside the shell at all times.

1226
01:16:03,693 --> 01:16:05,092
Satellite imagery shows

1227
01:16:05,094 --> 01:16:06,994
Shredder's reached the top
of Sacks Tower.

1228
01:16:06,996 --> 01:16:08,629
If that's where he's releasing
the toxin from...

1229
01:16:08,631 --> 01:16:09,697
It's gonna
spread all over the city!

1230
01:16:09,699 --> 01:16:10,998
We need to...

1231
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:12,066
...break a left!

1232
01:16:26,115 --> 01:16:29,684
We gotta find the elevators
and get up to the roof.

1233
01:16:29,686 --> 01:16:31,652
You guys get out of here.
Get to a safe distance.

1234
01:16:31,654 --> 01:16:33,287
No, no, we can go find Sacks

1235
01:16:33,289 --> 01:16:35,289
and get our hands on the
mutagen as a contingency plan,

1236
01:16:35,291 --> 01:16:38,092
just in case... You know.

1237
01:16:38,094 --> 01:16:40,227
Thanks for
the vote of confidence.

1238
01:16:40,229 --> 01:16:43,264
If we don't make it back,
bring the mutagen to Splinter.

1239
01:16:43,266 --> 01:16:44,999
It can save his life.

1240
01:16:45,001 --> 01:16:47,702
Sacks's laboratory's
on the 36th floor.

1241
01:16:47,704 --> 01:16:49,637
I've already disabled
the security system.

1242
01:16:49,639 --> 01:16:51,138
Oh, and, uh...

1243
01:16:51,640 --> 01:16:52,740
Good luck!

1244
01:16:54,142 --> 01:16:56,582
If I don't return,
remember me, April.

1245
01:16:56,912 --> 01:16:58,613
You can always find me

1246
01:16:59,214 --> 01:17:00,781
in here.

1247
01:17:02,951 --> 01:17:05,119
You're a complicated chick.

1248
01:17:22,738 --> 01:17:23,738
Yeah.

1249
01:17:24,973 --> 01:17:26,240
Elevator's just
around this corner!

1250
01:17:26,242 --> 01:17:27,642
All right, guys, listen up.

1251
01:17:27,644 --> 01:17:29,377
We stick to my plan
and we won't fail.

1252
01:17:29,379 --> 01:17:31,712
Fan out
in three, two, one.

1253
01:17:41,823 --> 01:17:42,857
Whoa.

1254
01:17:50,298 --> 01:17:51,932
Not the elevator.

1255
01:17:52,834 --> 01:17:53,934
Nope.

1256
01:17:55,438 --> 01:17:59,206
<i>The first vial
is filling with antidote now.</i>

1257
01:18:01,009 --> 01:18:03,344
Initiating
the toxin release procedure.

1258
01:18:24,332 --> 01:18:25,833
MC Mikey.

1259
01:18:28,904 --> 01:18:30,404
MC

1260
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:00,134
Ready, stance!

1261
01:19:05,240 --> 01:19:06,941
Hey, Mikey, remember that
thing you used to say

1262
01:19:06,943 --> 01:19:08,375
when we were kids?

1263
01:19:08,377 --> 01:19:09,376
You made me promise
never to say it again.

1264
01:19:09,378 --> 01:19:10,778
Forget about that.

1265
01:19:10,780 --> 01:19:12,880
Still got one in the tank?

1266
01:19:12,882 --> 01:19:14,014
I've been
holding it in for years.

1267
01:19:14,016 --> 01:19:15,249
Guys, we need a plan!

1268
01:19:15,251 --> 01:19:16,951
Cowabunga!

1269
01:19:28,797 --> 01:19:30,030
Leo!

1270
01:19:37,072 --> 01:19:38,906
Yeah, we got a 10-10.

1271
01:19:38,908 --> 01:19:40,748
Debris falling
from the building.

1272
01:19:41,810 --> 01:19:42,810
Come on.

1273
01:19:56,792 --> 01:19:58,459
I got this, guys!
I'll take him!

1274
01:19:58,927 --> 01:20:00,060
Come on!

1275
01:20:08,904 --> 01:20:10,337
Oh, no, you don't!

1276
01:20:19,948 --> 01:20:20,981
Seriously,

1277
01:20:21,449 --> 01:20:22,950
you two...

1278
01:20:22,952 --> 01:20:24,185
You're adorable, really.

1279
01:20:24,187 --> 01:20:26,427
I could just
pinch your cheeks!

1280
01:20:36,998 --> 01:20:38,518
Ugh, guys,
he's coming, he's coming!

1281
01:20:39,067 --> 01:20:40,301
Guys!

1282
01:20:41,870 --> 01:20:42,937
Donnie!

1283
01:20:44,439 --> 01:20:46,540
Come on, come on!

1284
01:20:46,542 --> 01:20:47,975
Hold on, Leo!

1285
01:20:52,547 --> 01:20:55,049
I understand a girl
with dead daddy issues.

1286
01:20:55,051 --> 01:20:57,291
I do. But you're not
gonna stop me.

1287
01:20:57,485 --> 01:20:59,119
This is history

1288
01:20:59,121 --> 01:21:00,521
repeating itself.

1289
01:21:00,523 --> 01:21:03,591
Your father walked in on me,
April, just like you did.

1290
01:21:03,593 --> 01:21:06,033
It took a few less bullets
to take him down, though.

1291
01:21:06,963 --> 01:21:07,963
You killed my father.

1292
01:21:22,277 --> 01:21:23,477
Move! Move!

1293
01:21:23,479 --> 01:21:25,045
Go, go, go!

1294
01:21:28,450 --> 01:21:29,884
Come on, guys!

1295
01:21:33,221 --> 01:21:34,421
Got you!

1296
01:22:07,122 --> 01:22:10,991
Enough. The lesson is over.

1297
01:22:10,993 --> 01:22:13,060
Ugh! We're getting
our asses kicked out there.

1298
01:22:13,062 --> 01:22:15,930
We only got 50 more seconds
before the toxin's released.

1299
01:22:15,932 --> 01:22:17,298
Hey.

1300
01:22:17,300 --> 01:22:18,699
Who wants to play Buck-Buck?

1301
01:22:18,701 --> 01:22:20,401
Buck-Buck?

1302
01:22:20,403 --> 01:22:22,269
What?
Buck-Buck. Tony-on-a-Pony.

1303
01:22:22,271 --> 01:22:24,371
Some people call it
Johnnie-on-a-Rock.

1304
01:22:24,373 --> 01:22:25,373
Wait.

1305
01:22:26,007 --> 01:22:27,341
Yeah.

1306
01:22:27,343 --> 01:22:29,543
Let's play Buck-Buck.

1307
01:22:29,545 --> 01:22:32,179
But why would we...
No.

1308
01:22:32,181 --> 01:22:34,315
We do what Leo says.

1309
01:22:34,317 --> 01:22:35,582
Lead the way.

1310
01:22:47,462 --> 01:22:48,595
O'Neil!

1311
01:22:50,232 --> 01:22:51,332
Argh!

1312
01:23:07,182 --> 01:23:08,315
Hmm.

1313
01:23:29,070 --> 01:23:30,704
Oh!

1314
01:23:51,526 --> 01:23:53,460
Cowabunga.

1315
01:23:56,298 --> 01:23:58,265
Are you okay?

1316
01:23:58,267 --> 01:24:00,200
Look, just go get some help
and take the mutagen with you.

1317
01:24:00,202 --> 01:24:01,962
Just go. Go!
No!

1318
01:24:06,141 --> 01:24:08,509
Just another day in the life
of a man of action.

1319
01:24:08,511 --> 01:24:10,244
Ow. No, I'm not getting up.

1320
01:24:12,081 --> 01:24:13,281
You know
how to use this thing?

1321
01:24:13,282 --> 01:24:14,748
It's a simple
command-line interface.

1322
01:24:14,750 --> 01:24:16,250
No one's used this code
in 15 years.

1323
01:24:16,252 --> 01:24:17,818
I mean,
I've read about it online.

1324
01:24:17,820 --> 01:24:19,740
But these kind of things
take time.

1325
01:24:25,326 --> 01:24:27,161
Thinking there was no way
I'd ever be in a position

1326
01:24:27,163 --> 01:24:29,003
where the fate
of an entire city...

1327
01:24:32,667 --> 01:24:34,301
I'll buy you some time.

1328
01:24:44,646 --> 01:24:45,712
<i>Toxin disbursement</i>

1329
01:24:45,714 --> 01:24:48,282
<i>in five, four,</i>

1330
01:24:48,817 --> 01:24:49,817
<i>three,</i>

1331
01:24:50,685 --> 01:24:52,186
<i>two...</i>

1332
01:24:55,824 --> 01:24:58,392
Bam! System disabled!
Who wants Italian?

1333
01:24:58,394 --> 01:25:00,627
I'm buying!
Tiramisu for everybody! Ah!

1334
01:25:15,376 --> 01:25:16,443
Ah.

1335
01:25:17,545 --> 01:25:18,779
Fall in!

1336
01:25:21,816 --> 01:25:24,485
Hold on! Hold it! Hold it!

1337
01:25:28,623 --> 01:25:31,558
If the spire falls and the
toxin makes ground impact,

1338
01:25:31,560 --> 01:25:33,727
it'll contaminate
a 10-block radius!

1339
01:25:33,729 --> 01:25:35,729
What are the odds of us
stopping that from happening?

1340
01:25:35,731 --> 01:25:39,333
Uh, 0.00000000003%!

1341
01:25:40,602 --> 01:25:44,238
I'll take it.
Nobody moves, no matter what.

1342
01:25:49,711 --> 01:25:51,278
But, Leo...

1343
01:25:51,280 --> 01:25:52,646
I said nobody moves!

1344
01:25:52,648 --> 01:25:53,728
Leo, I'm letting go!

1345
01:25:57,819 --> 01:25:59,286
Ah!

1346
01:26:00,388 --> 01:26:01,755
Shredder!

1347
01:26:03,791 --> 01:26:05,392
This is all that's left!

1348
01:26:05,394 --> 01:26:06,460
Little girl.

1349
01:26:10,765 --> 01:26:13,901
That belongs to me.

1350
01:26:13,903 --> 01:26:15,736
Hold on! Hold on! Hold it!

1351
01:26:44,766 --> 01:26:46,967
Get back! All the way back!

1352
01:26:56,277 --> 01:26:57,711
April!

1353
01:26:57,713 --> 01:26:59,213
Come on, guys!

1354
01:27:10,692 --> 01:27:11,858
Ah!

1355
01:27:11,860 --> 01:27:13,493
April!

1356
01:27:17,432 --> 01:27:18,432
Got you, Raph!

1357
01:27:19,867 --> 01:27:22,869
Hold on! Hold on! April!

1358
01:27:24,473 --> 01:27:25,739
I got you.

1359
01:27:34,282 --> 01:27:35,983
Swing me towards him!

1360
01:27:35,985 --> 01:27:37,484
Do it!

1361
01:27:42,890 --> 01:27:43,890
Leo!

1362
01:28:06,648 --> 01:28:08,415
That's my girl.

1363
01:28:31,307 --> 01:28:33,707
I think this is it, guys!

1364
01:28:33,709 --> 01:28:35,629
Does anyone have anything
they want to say?

1365
01:28:38,813 --> 01:28:40,380
Donnie?

1366
01:28:40,382 --> 01:28:41,748
I'm the one
who licks the icing

1367
01:28:41,750 --> 01:28:42,883
off the Pop-Tarts
every morning

1368
01:28:42,885 --> 01:28:44,718
and puts them back in the box.

1369
01:28:44,720 --> 01:28:46,019
No, no, no, no!

1370
01:28:47,955 --> 01:28:50,457
I so did not understand
the ending of <i> Lost.</i>

1371
01:28:55,330 --> 01:28:56,330
Raph?

1372
01:28:57,498 --> 01:28:58,632
I just, uh...

1373
01:28:59,867 --> 01:29:02,069
If this is
our last moment together,

1374
01:29:02,071 --> 01:29:04,971
I just want you guys
to know I'm sorry.

1375
01:29:04,973 --> 01:29:08,608
I'm sorry
I was so hard on you.

1376
01:29:08,610 --> 01:29:11,645
Every time I pushed you,
I... I threatened you,

1377
01:29:11,647 --> 01:29:13,847
I yelled at you, I pushed you
beyond your limits,

1378
01:29:13,849 --> 01:29:15,949
it was because
I believe in you!

1379
01:29:15,951 --> 01:29:18,085
I believe in each
one of you!

1380
01:29:18,087 --> 01:29:20,887
I believe in your spirit
and your intelligence

1381
01:29:20,889 --> 01:29:22,823
and your potential.

1382
01:29:22,825 --> 01:29:25,125
And every time I talked
about walking away,

1383
01:29:25,127 --> 01:29:27,661
it was because I was scared!

1384
01:29:27,663 --> 01:29:28,962
I just didn't think
I was good enough

1385
01:29:28,964 --> 01:29:30,564
to stand next to you

1386
01:29:30,566 --> 01:29:33,500
and call you brothers
and say to you

1387
01:29:33,502 --> 01:29:34,935
I love you!

1388
01:29:35,903 --> 01:29:37,938
I love you guys so much!

1389
01:29:39,440 --> 01:29:40,440
Raph?

1390
01:29:41,576 --> 01:29:42,743
We made it.

1391
01:29:43,845 --> 01:29:45,011
Are you crying?

1392
01:29:48,850 --> 01:29:52,018
No, ding-dong. It's just
a little dusty out here.

1393
01:30:18,112 --> 01:30:19,579
Okay, the mutagen is now

1394
01:30:19,581 --> 01:30:20,947
entering his bloodstream.

1395
01:30:22,183 --> 01:30:23,583
Master Splinter?

1396
01:30:23,585 --> 01:30:24,625
Nothing's happening.

1397
01:30:24,919 --> 01:30:26,420
Why isn't it working yet?

1398
01:30:29,957 --> 01:30:31,758
Mikey...

1399
01:30:31,760 --> 01:30:33,160
Huh?
Mikey, come closer.

1400
01:30:38,167 --> 01:30:39,866
What did he say?
What did he say?

1401
01:30:39,868 --> 01:30:42,202
He said, "Please get
your knee off my chest."

1402
01:30:43,872 --> 01:30:44,938
<i>Sensei!</i>

1403
01:30:45,907 --> 01:30:47,007
You're alive!

1404
01:30:47,009 --> 01:30:48,842
It worked!

1405
01:30:48,844 --> 01:30:52,579
I'm sorry.
This was all my fault.

1406
01:30:52,581 --> 01:30:55,749
You were right.
We weren't ready.

1407
01:30:55,917 --> 01:30:57,818
No.

1408
01:30:57,820 --> 01:31:02,656
It was I who wasn't ready
to let you go.

1409
01:31:02,658 --> 01:31:05,592
All you needed was to discover

1410
01:31:05,594 --> 01:31:09,629
that your true power lies
in believing in one another.

1411
01:31:26,113 --> 01:31:28,048
There she is.

1412
01:31:28,050 --> 01:31:30,116
New York's secret weapon.

1413
01:31:30,118 --> 01:31:32,252
How's your arm, Vern?

1414
01:31:32,254 --> 01:31:34,187
Well, it wouldn't be
much use in a fight.

1415
01:31:34,189 --> 01:31:35,749
Not that I was
much use before, but...

1416
01:31:36,691 --> 01:31:39,226
Did you get a new car?
Yeah.

1417
01:31:39,228 --> 01:31:41,561
You're looking
at the new Fenwick Express.

1418
01:31:41,563 --> 01:31:42,762
Pretty sweet, huh?

1419
01:31:42,764 --> 01:31:44,197
Kind of an upgrade.

1420
01:31:44,199 --> 01:31:45,665
I figured I'd need new wheels

1421
01:31:45,667 --> 01:31:47,567
after my old
work vehicle went boom.

1422
01:31:47,569 --> 01:31:49,069
Yeah, Channel 6 gave it to me.

1423
01:31:49,071 --> 01:31:50,604
They said
don't put a scratch on it,

1424
01:31:50,606 --> 01:31:52,272
but, like, lightning's going
to strike twice?

1425
01:31:52,274 --> 01:31:54,875
So, is that why
you called me here,

1426
01:31:54,877 --> 01:31:57,210
to talk about your new car?

1427
01:31:57,212 --> 01:31:59,179
I know that you're not exactly

1428
01:31:59,181 --> 01:32:01,681
a fancy restaurant
kind of girl, so I figured

1429
01:32:01,683 --> 01:32:03,917
a creepy underpass
in an abandoned neighborhood

1430
01:32:03,919 --> 01:32:05,552
in the middle of the night
was more your speed.

1431
01:32:05,554 --> 01:32:06,834
I wanted you
to be comfortable.

1432
01:32:12,027 --> 01:32:14,594
DJ Mikey in the house!

1433
01:32:17,865 --> 01:32:20,233
What are you guys doing here?

1434
01:32:20,235 --> 01:32:23,570
We figured we owed you a
thanks for keeping our secret.

1435
01:32:26,173 --> 01:32:29,075
You had a lot to gain
from telling people about us,

1436
01:32:29,077 --> 01:32:31,111
but you had our backs.

1437
01:32:31,113 --> 01:32:33,647
Yeah, 'cause that's what
family's for, Raph.

1438
01:32:36,284 --> 01:32:38,251
So you guys are driving now?

1439
01:32:38,253 --> 01:32:40,120
Yeah, man.
I pimped this bad boy out.

1440
01:32:40,122 --> 01:32:42,122
Got a 42-inch plasma with the

1441
01:32:42,124 --> 01:32:43,990
NBA package,
shave ice machine,

1442
01:32:43,992 --> 01:32:46,259
7.1 digital surround sound.

1443
01:32:46,261 --> 01:32:48,061
Check the bass, bra.

1444
01:32:51,699 --> 01:32:52,766
Uh-oh.

1445
01:33:09,717 --> 01:33:10,951
Ooh.

1446
01:33:14,622 --> 01:33:17,257
My bad. I'm still
figuring out the buttons.

1447
01:33:17,259 --> 01:33:19,626
That was my new
Fenwick Express!

1448
01:33:19,628 --> 01:33:22,062
I just... I just got that.

1449
01:33:22,064 --> 01:33:24,698
We better get out of here.
Want a ride home?

1450
01:33:26,734 --> 01:33:29,102
You know what? I think
we're gonna take the subway.

1451
01:33:29,104 --> 01:33:31,264
We're going
to take the subway.

1452
01:33:32,039 --> 01:33:33,773
You sure?

1453
01:33:33,775 --> 01:33:35,675
I got a real nice song
that's all cued up.

1454
01:33:35,677 --> 01:33:37,243
- It's special, girl.
- No, don't.

1455
01:33:37,245 --> 01:33:39,112
- For us.
- Come on, Mikey.

1456
01:33:39,114 --> 01:33:40,647
No, no, no,
Mikey, you promised.

1457
01:33:40,649 --> 01:33:45,151
<i>¶ Imagine me and you
I do</i>

1458
01:33:45,153 --> 01:33:48,254
<i>¶ I think about you</i>
<i>day and night</i>
<i>It's only right</i>

1459
01:33:48,990 --> 01:33:50,890
<i>¶ To think about... ¶</i>

1460
01:33:50,892 --> 01:33:52,158
I'm making
really good headway!

1461
01:33:52,160 --> 01:33:53,760
Shut up, Mikey!

1462
01:33:57,131 --> 01:34:01,935
<i>¶ I can't see me
loving nobody but you</i>

1463
01:34:01,937 --> 01:34:04,004
<i>¶ For all my life</i>

1464
01:34:05,006 --> 01:34:07,907
<i>¶ When you're with me, baby</i>

1465
01:34:07,909 --> 01:34:11,411
<i>¶ The skies'll be blue
For all my life! ¶</i>
