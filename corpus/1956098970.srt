1
00:00:56,657 --> 00:00:59,687
Decisive moments.

2
00:00:59,793 --> 00:01:03,503
Those once-in-a-lifetime
moments.

3
00:01:07,835 --> 00:01:11,265
That's what we're talkin'
about here, Buddy.

4
00:01:11,372 --> 00:01:13,442
Remember your first uniform?

5
00:01:13,541 --> 00:01:17,081
How you felt holding it,
seeing your number?

6
00:01:17,178 --> 00:01:21,818
For me, it's like
it was ten minutes ago.

7
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:24,615
And I don't know about you.

8
00:01:24,718 --> 00:01:29,788
But I ran straight home and
found the mirror. Am I right?

9
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:34,530
And in all my years as a player and all the
time I've put here as an assistant coach,

10
00:01:34,628 --> 00:01:38,528
you wanna know the one
feeling that topped that?

11
00:01:38,632 --> 00:01:42,702
Standing...
In that runway...

12
00:01:42,803 --> 00:01:46,773
Twelve guys dressed
in St. Joe's blue and gold,

13
00:01:46,874 --> 00:01:50,214
listening to the sound
of 20,000 people...

14
00:01:50,311 --> 00:01:52,651
Goin' out of their minds.

15
00:01:56,884 --> 00:02:00,254
Introducing
the six-foot, eight-inch...

16
00:02:00,354 --> 00:02:03,664
Star forward
for the St. Joseph's Bulls,

17
00:02:03,757 --> 00:02:06,787
from Chautauqua Falls, Illinois,

18
00:02:06,894 --> 00:02:09,564
number 31,

19
00:02:09,663 --> 00:02:12,433
Buddy Wilson!

20
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:19,637
You forgot the part about the
smell, the sweat and the liniment.

21
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:24,710
Look at him. He's out there dreaming
about his guest spot on arsenio.

22
00:02:28,549 --> 00:02:33,919
How many games are televised? Ten
nationally televised games per season.

23
00:02:34,021 --> 00:02:38,531
I want it in writing that I crack
starting lineup freshmen year.

24
00:02:40,561 --> 00:02:41,901
What?

25
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:46,897
Ooh, it's not a problem, Buddy.

26
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,210
Pro scouts gotta see me
on the floor.

27
00:02:51,305 --> 00:02:54,165
My agent said put it in writing,
or I sign with U.N.L.V.

28
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:58,479
What else does your agent want?

29
00:02:58,579 --> 00:03:02,719
He said the school I pick won't recruit
another power forward 'til my junior year.

30
00:03:02,816 --> 00:03:06,746
And wheels. Something in a
convertible because of my height.

31
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:10,294
Saab's cool. Karl Malone
drives a Saab convertible.

32
00:03:10,391 --> 00:03:14,461
We gotta get goin'. You have
dinner with the cheerleaders,

33
00:03:14,562 --> 00:03:19,532
seven o'clock. Hey, how about an A.C.
Cobra? Isiah drives a Cobra.

34
00:03:21,001 --> 00:03:23,871
Shit, yeah!

35
00:03:23,971 --> 00:03:27,481
Maybe you oughta play for publisher's
clearing house. Jimmy...

36
00:03:27,575 --> 00:03:33,245
- Buddy, what Jimmy means... - hey, this
program is only as good as the deal I get.

37
00:03:33,347 --> 00:03:36,317
Look at the time.

38
00:03:36,417 --> 00:03:39,387
Buddy, coach Fox wants to see you
before we meet up with the cowbelles.

39
00:03:39,487 --> 00:03:43,257
Hey, did I tell you one of them
was asked to pose for playboy?

40
00:03:43,357 --> 00:03:48,227
I wanna see the head fake. This is
the spot, right? 1981 championship.

41
00:03:48,329 --> 00:03:52,999
- Jimmy, why don't you show Buddy your ring?
- This is the spot.

42
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:57,570
The Jimmy Dolan "shake-and-bake."
"The mouth that scored."

43
00:03:57,671 --> 00:04:01,711
- Oh, shit.
- Bet you can't drive on me.

44
00:04:04,044 --> 00:04:07,454
I'll take a rain check.

45
00:04:07,548 --> 00:04:11,248
Nah, come on, let's do it,
50 bucks a point, 11-point game.

46
00:04:13,554 --> 00:04:15,564
Some other time.

47
00:04:15,656 --> 00:04:18,286
Come on, man.
I'll even spot you five.

48
00:04:31,805 --> 00:04:34,505
So that's what, nine-three?

49
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:37,278
Me up six?
Fifty a point.

50
00:04:40,981 --> 00:04:43,881
Six times 50 is what?
Huh?

51
00:04:47,721 --> 00:04:50,621
- Once more.
- Aw, this is ridiculous. This is...

52
00:04:50,724 --> 00:04:53,394
Aw, you okay? Guys, guys,
we really gotta get goin'.

53
00:04:53,494 --> 00:04:56,704
Seven times 50!

54
00:05:01,735 --> 00:05:04,335
You're down 350.

55
00:05:04,438 --> 00:05:07,838
Let me guess. Your agent
took your S.A.T.'S for you?

56
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:13,954
Keep your hands up!

57
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:17,953
Defense is more important
than breathing.

58
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:19,551
Buddy, we really
gotta get goin'.

59
00:05:20,788 --> 00:05:21,988
There's nothin' uglier than
a bunch of hungry cheerleaders.

60
00:05:22,089 --> 00:05:24,659
So, you wanna see the head fake?

61
00:05:24,758 --> 00:05:26,858
Jimmy Dolan's
"shake-and-bake."

62
00:05:27,961 --> 00:05:31,471
It's a three-stage process.
Pay attention.

63
00:05:31,565 --> 00:05:34,595
First,

64
00:05:34,702 --> 00:05:37,912
you think I'm gonna go left.

65
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:40,505
So, I indicate left.

66
00:05:40,608 --> 00:05:44,678
But you know I'm not gonna go with my first
move, not with this thing on my leg.

67
00:05:44,778 --> 00:05:47,448
So, now...
I go left again!

68
00:05:47,548 --> 00:05:51,648
Am I going too fast for you? You having
trouble following me with that megabyte mind?

69
00:05:51,752 --> 00:05:54,992
Okay, pay attention.
Here comes the second stage.

70
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:58,858
You think I'm tryin' to sell ya
on my right side.

71
00:06:00,628 --> 00:06:04,098
But what I'm really doin'...

72
00:06:05,566 --> 00:06:09,636
That's the third stage.

73
00:06:09,737 --> 00:06:13,467
Hey, don't worry about it. When it's really workin'...
I don't know where I'm goin'.

74
00:06:13,574 --> 00:06:16,914
Buddy, don't sweat the 400.

75
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:20,710
You can take it out of the
50,000 you were gonna pay me.

76
00:06:20,814 --> 00:06:23,824
I'm not playin' for you!

77
00:06:23,917 --> 00:06:27,957
But, Bud... wait, Buddy...
th-the cowbelles.

78
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:31,055
To hell with the cowbelles!

79
00:06:44,672 --> 00:06:47,172
How long we been
trackin' this kid?

80
00:06:50,978 --> 00:06:53,508
Seventy-five mailings, coach.

81
00:06:53,614 --> 00:06:56,624
Eight in-home visits.
Two trips to disneyworld.

82
00:06:56,717 --> 00:06:59,417
Thirty-seven sweatshirts
and, um...

83
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,120
And 19 lobster dinners.

84
00:07:03,223 --> 00:07:06,733
That's a lot of lobster,
wouldn't you say, J.D.?

85
00:07:06,827 --> 00:07:09,857
- There are better power forwards.
- Oh, yeah? Name one.

86
00:07:09,963 --> 00:07:14,003
- Conover.
- Conover? You can deliver conover?

87
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:17,571
Damn straight! Talked to his father yesterday.
He's in the bag.

88
00:07:17,671 --> 00:07:21,611
Your bag, the one with conover in
it, is addressed to Bobby knight.

89
00:07:21,709 --> 00:07:24,679
Conover signed a letter of intent
with Indiana yesterday afternoon.

90
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:28,518
I bet you lost a lot of sleep
waitin' to tell me that.

91
00:07:28,616 --> 00:07:31,986
- Buddy Wilson was mine, and you lost him!
- Mark, get outta here.

92
00:07:32,085 --> 00:07:34,485
- You get...
- Now.

93
00:07:43,764 --> 00:07:48,044
Take a load off, J.D.

94
00:07:49,903 --> 00:07:51,713
I said, sit.

95
00:07:57,678 --> 00:07:59,678
Knee's hurtin', huh?

96
00:08:01,515 --> 00:08:05,045
Docs say you don't watch it, you end up in a
wheelchair by 40, but what do they know, right?

97
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:08,492
Always time
for a little one-on-one?

98
00:08:08,589 --> 00:08:11,159
The Wilson kid
is an asshole, Foxie.

99
00:08:11,258 --> 00:08:13,858
Kid's 18.
You expect Gandhi maybe?

100
00:08:13,961 --> 00:08:17,731
- He's not a team player!
- Yeah? Neither were you.

101
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:20,001
You were a showboat
and a ball hog.

102
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:24,540
I had to bench you almost as many times
as I brought you home for dinner!

103
00:08:24,638 --> 00:08:28,808
Look at you now. You're
practically a functioning adult.

104
00:08:28,909 --> 00:08:32,009
Jesus, Jimmy,
we needed that goddamn kid!

105
00:08:32,112 --> 00:08:36,552
- Wouldn't want him on my team.
- It's not your team!

106
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:39,750
What is the matter with you?

107
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:44,693
I mean, we keep going over the
same ground time and time again!

108
00:08:44,792 --> 00:08:47,802
You got one of the finest basketball
minds I've ever come across,

109
00:08:47,895 --> 00:08:51,665
but you haven't got a clue as
to what coaching's all about!

110
00:08:51,765 --> 00:08:55,735
Why? Because I don't coach the way you do?
No, I'm sorry, I don't play by the rules!

111
00:08:55,836 --> 00:09:00,136
Because you don't see the big picture!
You're always thinking about yourself!

112
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:05,580
You think I've been grooming you for ten years for fun?
Think I'm gonna be here forever?

113
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:08,719
Foxie, you've been sayin' that for years.
You're never gonna retire!

114
00:09:08,816 --> 00:09:13,786
Not for you I'm not, because never once have
you proven to me that you're ready for my job!

115
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:17,557
- And Collins has?
- He can bring in the talent! He can recruit!

116
00:09:17,658 --> 00:09:19,988
Hey, I gave everything
I had to Saint Joe's!

117
00:09:20,093 --> 00:09:23,703
If I don't blow my knee out senior
year, I'm playin' pro ball!

118
00:09:23,797 --> 00:09:28,697
Hearts and flowers. Only reason you're coachin'
here is because you can't be playin' there.

119
00:09:28,802 --> 00:09:31,202
You still wanna be the star!

120
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:33,974
I don't need this.

121
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:38,854
There's only room for one star around here,
ray, and that's you! You got that covered!

122
00:09:38,946 --> 00:09:42,116
Hey! Get your ass
back here! Jimmy!

123
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:54,161
Yo, yo, Jimmy D.!
We got somethin' for you.

124
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:58,101
Hold up, hold up. What's goin' on, man?
Where ya goin' so fast?

125
00:09:58,198 --> 00:10:02,098
Yo, yo, what's your rush?
Check it out.

126
00:10:02,202 --> 00:10:05,712
We switched numbers.

127
00:10:05,806 --> 00:10:08,136
That's mcgraph's number
you're wearin' on your head.

128
00:10:08,241 --> 00:10:11,181
Man, you are trippin', man. When are
you gonna let me ride... go home.

129
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:15,148
Jimmy, when are you gonna gimme a
ride in this car? Come on, Jimmy.

130
00:10:15,248 --> 00:10:18,618

Ladies and gentlemen.

136
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:52,050
If you go out and ask anyone what they know about St.
Joe's, they'll say one thing:

137
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:57,422
The greatest basketball coach
in college history, Ray Fox!

138
00:11:00,761 --> 00:11:02,801
Foxie! Foxie! Foxie!

139

Foxie! Foxie!
Foxie!
Thank you.

142
00:11:13,941 --> 00:11:17,981
In the last 31 years,

143
00:11:20,313 --> 00:11:24,453
I've won 641 basketball games,

144
00:11:24,551 --> 00:11:28,061
seven national championships...

145
00:11:30,223 --> 00:11:34,193
And caught five fish.

146
00:11:35,495 --> 00:11:38,865
I think it's time
to even the score.

147
00:11:40,233 --> 00:11:42,903
This will be my last season.

148
00:11:45,405 --> 00:11:48,835
In two weeks time,

149
00:11:48,942 --> 00:11:51,882
I will make the recommendation
for my successor...

150
00:11:51,979 --> 00:11:56,719
To the board of regents
at their annual meeting.

151
00:11:56,817 --> 00:11:59,747
I know a lot of you
people out there.

152
00:11:59,853 --> 00:12:04,763
You come to the games. You come to the dinners.
Some of your sons have played on the team...

153
00:12:04,858 --> 00:12:09,028
...for providing serious
and catholic education...

154
00:12:09,129 --> 00:12:12,729
To the farthest reaches
of the third world.

155
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:15,903
As you all know,
each year at our banquet,

156
00:12:16,003 --> 00:12:19,273
we focus on a specific mission.

157
00:12:19,372 --> 00:12:22,912
And tonight,
it is my honor to bring you...

158
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:27,350
The Winabi Parish School
in Kenya.

159
00:12:27,447 --> 00:12:30,247
Students at Winabi...

160
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:33,520
Are matriculating
through all 12 grades.

161
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:36,790
And there are plans for a nurses'
training program next year.

162
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:40,030
Schools must
practically reach it's...

163
00:12:40,127 --> 00:12:44,257
And although the average age
of the teachers is 32,

164
00:12:44,364 --> 00:12:48,074
they seem to be teaching
enormously well, where ya going?

165
00:12:48,168 --> 00:12:51,908
Under rather aggravated circumstances
because of the size of the class they have.

166
00:12:52,005 --> 00:12:55,005
But of course,
having so many classes...

167
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:58,448
Sports becomes
a very, very positive part...

168
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:05,046
Yeah.

169
00:13:05,152 --> 00:13:07,152
That's it.

170
00:13:12,492 --> 00:13:13,962
Yes!

171
00:13:14,061 --> 00:13:15,961
It turns out
the school is run...

172
00:13:16,063 --> 00:13:18,303
By none other than
father Kermit O'Hara,

173
00:13:18,398 --> 00:13:20,968
the other guard
on Bob cousy's holy cross team.

174
00:13:21,068 --> 00:13:24,468
I looked up O'Hara's stats; He's six-foot.
Then, I had a kid in the physics department...

175
00:13:24,571 --> 00:13:28,281
Take the angle of the sun, depth of the field
and the camera angle under consideration.

176
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:32,105
Given that data, this kid
is at least six-eight...

177
00:13:32,212 --> 00:13:34,512
With a vertical leap
that's off the charts.

178
00:13:34,614 --> 00:13:37,854
You're sayin' there was a second
gunman on the grassy knoll? Eat me.

179
00:13:37,951 --> 00:13:42,161
- When's the last time you saw a big man move like that?
- Buddy Wilson.

180
00:13:42,255 --> 00:13:45,825
Do the names Olajuwon Manute Bol,
Dikembe Mutombo mean anything to you?

181
00:13:45,926 --> 00:13:51,426
All native africans, all playing in the N.B.A.
The guard's got tits.

182
00:13:51,531 --> 00:13:54,401
Small ones. You're right.
He's playing against a girl.

183
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:58,611
- So what? Collins, run that back, will ya?
- Turn it off, Mark.

184
00:13:58,705 --> 00:14:04,135
I got a good feeling about this. All I need is
a week and you spot me the airfare to Africa.

185
00:14:04,244 --> 00:14:07,284
I already got
a flight booked, Jimmy.

186
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,280
You're on a 6:30
to Boise.

187
00:14:09,382 --> 00:14:13,852
Boise? Boise's a class D
tournament. Boise is...

188
00:14:15,422 --> 00:14:17,762
His assignment.

189
00:14:21,628 --> 00:14:23,628
Change of plans.

190
00:14:40,513 --> 00:14:43,283
Nice try.

191
00:15:46,313 --> 00:15:48,253
Excuse me.

192
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:52,049
Are we near "win-nah-bee?"

193
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:55,423
Uh...

194
00:15:55,522 --> 00:15:58,092
"Win-nay-bee?"

195
00:15:58,191 --> 00:16:00,161
Winabi.
Winabi.
Yeah.

196
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:02,160
- Hey.
- Yeah?

197
00:16:14,274 --> 00:16:17,284
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

198
00:17:18,438 --> 00:17:21,468
That's it. No. The other one.
Blue and gold. Right.

199
00:17:54,707 --> 00:17:58,677
Excuse me. Hi.
How ya doin'?

200
00:17:58,778 --> 00:18:04,348
Uh... Jambo.
Jambo.

201
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:13,526
Can I help you?
You speak english.

202
00:18:16,663 --> 00:18:19,833
Yeah. Uh, I'm trying to get
to this place... Winabi.

203
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:23,372
Is there a bus or something? When
do you wish to travel there?

204
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:26,770
When's the next one leave? I
will check the schedule for you.

205
00:18:26,873 --> 00:18:30,413
Oh, great, thank you very much.
I appreciate it.

206
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:49,801
Why do you go to Winabi? I'm meeting someone there.
Father O'Hara. You know him?

207
00:18:49,896 --> 00:18:53,396
You're a priest?

208
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:56,240
Me? Jesus, no.

209
00:19:06,446 --> 00:19:11,146
I'm afraid I have bad news for you.
You have missed the last bus.

210
00:19:11,251 --> 00:19:13,891
Oh, shit.
When was that?

211
00:19:15,722 --> 00:19:18,662
1974.

212
00:19:33,806 --> 00:19:36,206
Welcome to mingori!

213
00:19:37,877 --> 00:19:41,577
I'm Nyaga.
Jimmy Dolan.

214
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:45,321
You dress strangely
for a copper speculator.

215
00:19:45,418 --> 00:19:48,318
I beg your pardon? Come
on, Jimmy Dolan, please.

216
00:19:48,421 --> 00:19:50,561
You don't go to Winabi
to sightsee.

217
00:19:50,657 --> 00:19:52,957
How did you know
I was going to Winabi?

218
00:19:53,059 --> 00:19:57,959
This is a very small town,
and I'm the biggest man in it.

219
00:19:58,064 --> 00:20:00,204
Now,

220
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:03,670
if you're interested in copper mining
Winabi, you talk the Turkey to me.

221
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:08,210
The Winabi hills will be belonging to me
soon, and I'll be looking for shareholders.

222
00:20:08,308 --> 00:20:12,308
No, no, you don't understand.
See, I'm a coach. Basketball.

223
00:20:12,412 --> 00:20:15,982
I'm here to scout a player, not copper.
You know what basketball is?

224
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:32,930
Come, come, Jimmy Dolan,
come and meet the guys.

225
00:20:33,032 --> 00:20:36,772
Welcome to the home
of the mingori pistons!

226
00:20:39,772 --> 00:20:42,782
I knew the sport travelled,
but where did you learn?

227
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:47,508
Satellite dish TV.

228
00:20:47,614 --> 00:20:50,754
And we get ESPN,

229
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:53,890
hbo, mtv...

230
00:20:53,986 --> 00:20:56,486
And of course...

231
00:20:56,589 --> 00:20:58,689
Home shopping network.

232
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:03,030
We defeated the central bank team three times.
We played the tanzanian rail road team...

233
00:21:03,129 --> 00:21:05,429
For two million
Kenyan shillings.

234
00:21:05,532 --> 00:21:08,032
And of course,
the winner takes everything.

235
00:21:08,134 --> 00:21:11,904
You mean, a bet? That's it!
A bet.

236
00:21:12,004 --> 00:21:14,444
Ah, everyone...

237
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:17,641
And this gym was paid for
with those moneys.

238
00:21:17,744 --> 00:21:20,414
New dream team, team Mingori!

239
00:21:20,513 --> 00:21:23,453
Atlanta, '96!

240
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:26,950
Mifundo!

241
00:21:27,053 --> 00:21:29,693
Yeah?
Mifundo,
meet the coach.

242
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:32,959
We're old friends.
You've got some nice moves.

243
00:21:33,059 --> 00:21:37,699
I go for the iron. Mifundo, the coach wants you.
He wants to take you to America.

244
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:42,466
And we make the deal right now,
okay, Jimmy Dolan?

245
00:21:42,569 --> 00:21:45,469
Wait, no, no, hold on a second, fellas.
I didn't say that.

246
00:21:45,572 --> 00:21:48,342
I'm impressed that you guys
are so interested in the game,

247
00:21:48,441 --> 00:21:51,011
but if you could please tell me,
how do I get to Winabi?

248
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:54,010
Winabi?

249
00:21:54,113 --> 00:21:58,893
Someone is confusing you.
There's nothing in Winabi.

250
00:21:58,985 --> 00:22:02,985
Do you know why the crows
fly upside down over Winabi?

251
00:22:03,089 --> 00:22:05,589
No. Why?

252
00:22:05,692 --> 00:22:09,602
It's because the place
is hardly worth shitting on.

253
00:22:11,598 --> 00:22:16,338
Hey, just don't talk to me about places
not worth shitting on! All right?

254
00:22:16,436 --> 00:22:18,366
I'm from Buffalo.

255
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:46,433
Aw, shit.

256
00:22:48,568 --> 00:22:52,568
Thank god. Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow
down, slow down just one second!

257
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:55,742
Hold on, hold on,
stop, slow down... hey!

258
00:22:55,842 --> 00:22:57,882
I just wanna know how do I... just
tell me... [ People on bus laughing

259
00:22:57,977 --> 00:23:00,847
let me just ask you...
Which way is...

260
00:23:00,947 --> 00:23:03,977
Winabi?

261
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:39,753
Second from the left.
Check him out.

262
00:23:39,852 --> 00:23:45,062
Fourteen foot and he can dribble.
This is not the zoo. Africa, ray.

263
00:23:45,157 --> 00:23:50,997
This is Africa. Jimmy Dolan,
international recruiter, reporting.

264
00:24:00,907 --> 00:24:02,837
Peace?

265
00:24:04,577 --> 00:24:07,077
Live long and prosper?

266
00:24:11,851 --> 00:24:13,921
Winabi?

267
00:24:19,592 --> 00:24:23,462
Guys, I'll give you
anything you want.

268
00:24:24,631 --> 00:24:27,601
Anything I have
if you could please...

269
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:30,670
Just tell me
how to get to Winabi.

270
00:24:40,279 --> 00:24:43,019
Hey, guys?

271
00:24:43,115 --> 00:24:46,585
Fellas, how-how-how
much farther is it?

272
00:24:46,686 --> 00:24:49,056
Huh? Could you just
give me a clue?

273
00:24:49,155 --> 00:24:52,215
Are we almost there?

274
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:55,934
Hey, yo, how we doing?
Yo, wait up.

275
00:24:56,028 --> 00:24:58,798
Come on,
20-second timeout.
Hey.

276
00:25:25,224 --> 00:25:26,494
Hi.

277
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:33,072
Hey, how are you?

278
00:25:35,167 --> 00:25:37,967
How ya doin'?

279
00:25:42,141 --> 00:25:44,181
Holy shit.

280
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:48,178
How ya doin'?

281
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:56,255
Hey, Buddy.
Hey, wait up.

282
00:25:57,924 --> 00:26:01,134
Just-just a second.
Let me ask you...

283
00:26:01,227 --> 00:26:04,227
Where ya goin'?

284
00:26:27,854 --> 00:26:30,994
I'm looking for father O'Hara.

285
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:33,690
O'Hara?

286
00:26:33,793 --> 00:26:36,333
B...

287
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:41,330
Six.
B-six.

288
00:26:45,237 --> 00:26:49,807
B, as in...

289
00:26:52,144 --> 00:26:55,354
- Bingo!
- Bingo!

290
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:59,047
Another lucky winner. Bring it up here, and St.
George will take care of you.

291
00:26:59,151 --> 00:27:01,091
Bingo! Bingo!

292
00:27:01,187 --> 00:27:05,287
You are the same Kermit O'Hara who
played with Bob cousy at holy cross?

293
00:27:05,391 --> 00:27:09,001
Oh, I wouldn't call it playing, son. The man
never even passed. All right, that's enough now.

294
00:27:09,095 --> 00:27:11,895
But the picture... if you're coming,
Mr. Dolan, you'd better hurry up...

295
00:27:11,998 --> 00:27:14,328
Because I'm celebrating
mass in ngongorola.

296
00:27:14,433 --> 00:27:17,003
It's a 52-kilometer drive
before sundown.

297
00:27:17,103 --> 00:27:19,073
Well, if you could
just take a look.

298
00:27:19,171 --> 00:27:21,341
- Ah.
- Beisa.

299
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:25,640
Beisa? Oh, tough luck, son.
She's getting married next week.

300
00:27:25,745 --> 00:27:29,415
No, not the girl. The guy in the background.
I know it's a blur... Saleh.

301
00:27:29,515 --> 00:27:31,975
The boy's name is Saleh.
"Sah-lay."

302
00:27:32,084 --> 00:27:35,394
- Where do I find him?
- Ah, Saleh. Yes, Saleh.

303
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:37,717
The boy will tell you!

304
00:27:37,824 --> 00:27:39,394
What...

305
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:42,031
Well, I'll see you all
next week.

306
00:27:42,128 --> 00:27:45,998
I don't speak...
Father, what boy?

307
00:27:46,098 --> 00:27:48,268
What boy?

308
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:52,741
Ready when you are.

309
00:27:57,443 --> 00:27:59,053
You speak english?

310
00:27:59,145 --> 00:28:02,275
Your watch?
It's digital?

311
00:28:02,381 --> 00:28:05,321
Saleh!

312
00:28:25,237 --> 00:28:27,437
Saleh.

313
00:28:42,822 --> 00:28:45,062
How ya doin'?

314
00:28:47,226 --> 00:28:49,826
Jimmy Dolan,
St. Joe's College.

315
00:28:52,364 --> 00:28:54,334
Jambo.

316
00:28:54,433 --> 00:28:56,803
Great to meet ya.

317
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:08,920
You come halfway around the world
to see me play this: Basketball?

318
00:29:09,015 --> 00:29:11,045
That's what I said.

319
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:14,220
Are you healthy up here?
Never said that.

320
00:29:19,191 --> 00:29:21,091
Go on, take a shot.

321
00:29:48,154 --> 00:29:50,894
Yeah, that's a little better.

322
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:53,460
Try not to slap the ball.

323
00:29:53,559 --> 00:29:55,489
Try it again
with your left hand.

324
00:30:11,878 --> 00:30:15,178
Are you very sad, Jimmy Dolan?

325
00:30:16,115 --> 00:30:18,275
A little.

326
00:30:18,384 --> 00:30:21,054
I disappoint you maybe?

327
00:30:21,153 --> 00:30:23,563
Well, you're not exactly
what I expected.

328
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:28,025
Who is this person that tells
you I'm such a good player?

329
00:30:28,127 --> 00:30:31,157
Me.
I told myself.

330
00:31:26,485 --> 00:31:29,885
I played a good joke on you?

331
00:31:29,989 --> 00:31:31,989
Yeah, I'm laughing my ass off.

332
00:31:32,091 --> 00:31:34,161
Let's shoot some hoops.

333
00:31:36,495 --> 00:31:38,595
Nice shot. But you know,

334
00:31:38,697 --> 00:31:41,567
you've been coming down the right
side for the past two hours.

335
00:31:41,667 --> 00:31:45,267
Do you think you can take me on the left?
Come on, it's all yours. Left! Left!

336
00:31:45,371 --> 00:31:48,541
My grandmother can dribble with her left hand.
Can she see enough to shoot?

337
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:51,140
Left!
Come on!

338
00:31:51,243 --> 00:31:53,683
Left. Which one's left? I'm
always forgetting this.

339
00:31:53,779 --> 00:31:56,349
Left hand.

340
00:31:58,584 --> 00:32:00,554
Naftalanja!

341
00:32:00,652 --> 00:32:03,162
It's fun, yes,
this game.
No.

342
00:32:03,255 --> 00:32:06,425
It's more than fun.
More than fun?

343
00:32:06,525 --> 00:32:11,025
Do you have any idea what's it's like to play
against top players in the championship game?

344
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:15,470
It brings out the talent that's sleeping inside your body.
It's talent you never knew you had.

345
00:32:15,567 --> 00:32:18,267
I mean, it's like
suddenly... you could fly.

346
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:21,470
I often think
I would like to fly.

347
00:32:21,573 --> 00:32:24,283
Yeah, well, you can fly, my man.

348
00:32:24,376 --> 00:32:27,006
Number one "Nubah" draft pick.
"Nubah"?

349
00:32:27,113 --> 00:32:29,553
Yeah, "Nubah", N.B.A.

350
00:32:29,648 --> 00:32:32,318
Oh, N.B.A.
Where did you learn about that?

351
00:32:32,418 --> 00:32:35,048
Sports Illustrated,
swimsuit editions.

352
00:32:35,154 --> 00:32:38,424
You're going with me, Saleh.

353
00:32:38,524 --> 00:32:41,734
And I promise you, you're gonna live
the rest of your life like a king.

354
00:32:41,827 --> 00:32:44,327
Like a king?

355
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:48,000
Just like a king.

356
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:50,070
I like you, Jimmy Dolan.

357
00:32:50,169 --> 00:32:52,599
It makes a lovely idea.
So you'll do it?

358
00:32:52,704 --> 00:32:55,974
You'll come?

359
00:32:56,075 --> 00:32:57,975
Jalang.

360
00:32:58,077 --> 00:33:00,647
Hey, Saleh, wait up.
Hey, yo, where ya goin'?

361
00:33:09,221 --> 00:33:11,121
Come on, we...

362
00:33:12,391 --> 00:33:15,231
Hey, come on, where ya goin'?

363
00:33:15,327 --> 00:33:18,657
Don't leave me here
with the goat.

364
00:33:55,667 --> 00:34:00,767
Coffee?
Light with sugar.

365
00:34:27,266 --> 00:34:30,296
- Ow!
- Sorry.

366
00:34:30,402 --> 00:34:34,672
So, it, uh... must be hard
working out here all alone?

367
00:34:34,773 --> 00:34:37,483
Mr. Dolan,
I am never alone.

368
00:34:37,576 --> 00:34:40,276
How far do these kids
go in school anyway?

369
00:34:43,382 --> 00:34:45,852
You want to know if Saleh
can get into St. Joe's?

370
00:34:45,951 --> 00:34:49,461
It's not like he's got to take quantum physics.
Don't be patronizing.

371
00:34:49,555 --> 00:34:53,855
Winabi have survived adversities that would have
knocked you out of the picture centuries ago.

372
00:34:53,959 --> 00:34:58,199
They are remarkable people. No kidding. This
kid's got the hang time of a hot air balloon.

373
00:34:58,297 --> 00:35:00,267
I'd forget about Saleh
if I were you.

374
00:35:00,366 --> 00:35:03,196
Forget about him? I just found
a future N.B.A. Hall of famer.

375
00:35:03,302 --> 00:35:05,802
- What you found is a headman's son.
- A what?

376
00:35:05,904 --> 00:35:08,474
He's the son of Urudu,
chief of the Winabi.

377
00:35:08,574 --> 00:35:10,814
Saleh's royalty, like a prince.

378
00:35:10,909 --> 00:35:13,749
- Is that the reason for the bodyguard?
- Mm-hmm.

379
00:35:13,845 --> 00:35:17,745
Saleh's gonna fit right in at St. Joe's.
We got two princes, we got a Duke,

380
00:35:17,849 --> 00:35:21,189
we got a sheik from Bahrain... Saleh is
the next in line to lead his people.

381
00:35:21,287 --> 00:35:23,117
His parents are
extremely protective.

382
00:35:23,222 --> 00:35:25,662
Sister, parents
are my specialty.

383
00:35:25,757 --> 00:35:28,787
All I gotta do is explain
to Saleh's mom and dad...

384
00:35:28,894 --> 00:35:34,174
That I'm only gonna borrow him for four years
and return him with a first-class education.

385
00:35:37,903 --> 00:35:40,913
And your N.B.A., are they going
to borrow him after that?

386
00:35:41,006 --> 00:35:44,506
After that, we'll see. Anyway,
Saleh's already on board.

387
00:35:44,610 --> 00:35:49,520
Oh, how so? I spoke to him last night
and he said very clearly, "jalang ."

388
00:35:49,615 --> 00:35:52,915
Why, what's so funny?

389
00:35:53,018 --> 00:35:56,858
"Jalang," Mr. Dolan, is a Winabi way
of saying "no" without insulting you.

390
00:35:56,955 --> 00:36:00,825
It means, "I will consider it for
eternity." Keep that on for an hour.

391
00:36:00,926 --> 00:36:03,226
You know, it's working.
What is it?

392
00:36:03,329 --> 00:36:08,199
It's iodine, kerosene
and sterilized camel stool.

393
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:12,440
Is she serious?

394
00:36:14,406 --> 00:36:16,836
Now,

395
00:36:16,942 --> 00:36:20,552
Saleh's father's name is... Urudu.
Urudu.

396
00:36:20,646 --> 00:36:24,276
Okay, and these elders,
they're all guys, right? Yes.

397
00:36:24,383 --> 00:36:26,893
Oh, excellent! You see, I love
talking to guys about this stuff.

398
00:36:26,985 --> 00:36:31,915
I mean, after all, it's a male thing, right?
I mean it's that "iron John" thing.

399
00:36:39,064 --> 00:36:41,674
Excuse me, gentlemen,
if I might just... break in...

400
00:36:46,805 --> 00:36:49,405
Uh, uh...

401
00:36:49,508 --> 00:36:52,908
Which one of you is Saleh's dad?

402
00:36:56,748 --> 00:36:59,388
Nubah! Nubah!

403
00:36:59,485 --> 00:37:01,715
Nubah. Nubah.

404
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:05,320
Yeah, the N.B.A.
No, I'm glad you asked that.

405
00:37:05,424 --> 00:37:07,894
- He would make money like Air Jordan?
- Yes.

406
00:37:07,993 --> 00:37:10,733
Saleh could be just like him.

407
00:37:10,829 --> 00:37:13,469
Which one of you is Urudu?

408
00:37:17,569 --> 00:37:19,769
'Cause if you could just...
Tell him...

409
00:37:19,871 --> 00:37:22,611
That the N.B.A.
Can be very generous.

410
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:36,285
That was Urudu?

411
00:37:57,643 --> 00:37:59,783
Hi.

412
00:37:59,878 --> 00:38:03,348
Listen, I thought I would come
up here and try to explain.

413
00:38:03,449 --> 00:38:07,649
Maybe I'm pressin' a little hard,
but it's only because your son...

414
00:38:07,753 --> 00:38:11,393
Let me put it to you like this. I
could put him with any four guys,

415
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:15,730
any four guys and take that team
straight to the final four.

416
00:38:17,396 --> 00:38:21,526
You probably don't even know
what the final four are.

417
00:38:23,402 --> 00:38:25,402
Forget it.

418
00:38:25,504 --> 00:38:29,414
Together, we could set up a package
that kept Saleh away from home...

419
00:38:29,508 --> 00:38:31,938
A maximum five months
at the most.

420
00:38:32,043 --> 00:38:36,883
You could visit. I don't know what
your holiday schedule is like, but...

421
00:38:39,017 --> 00:38:43,017
I mean, if I may say so, sir, you
look to be in quite good health,

422
00:38:43,121 --> 00:38:45,921
and I mean that
only to say that it...

423
00:38:54,132 --> 00:38:57,572
I have this problem.
I... I can't shut up.

424
00:38:57,669 --> 00:39:00,839
My tribe has many problems,
Mr. Dolan.

425
00:39:06,712 --> 00:39:10,452
I'm sorry...
But I cannot listen to you.

426
00:39:48,153 --> 00:39:51,763
Am I good enough
to play for you?

427
00:39:52,824 --> 00:39:56,094
You're better than that.

428
00:39:56,194 --> 00:39:59,034
Tell me about St. Joseph's.

429
00:40:01,667 --> 00:40:03,967
Well, hmm...

430
00:40:04,069 --> 00:40:06,139
It's very old.

431
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:08,067
A lot of tradition.

432
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:14,050
It's where I went to school.

433
00:40:14,145 --> 00:40:16,975
That's where you played?

434
00:40:17,082 --> 00:40:20,492
1981 championship ring.

435
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:27,430
Here.

436
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:32,461
It's beautiful.

437
00:40:32,564 --> 00:40:36,574
I'd like to play for St.
Joseph's, very, very much.

438
00:40:41,206 --> 00:40:45,076
My father is a stubborn man. He says I
have a lot to learn before I am a leader.

439
00:40:45,644 --> 00:40:49,554
He says I must put my people's
heart in front of mine.

440
00:40:50,549 --> 00:40:53,889
Your father says
there's a lot of problems.

441
00:40:54,686 --> 00:40:58,056
- Maybe I could help.
- You are an outsider.

442
00:40:58,156 --> 00:41:01,656
My father does not trust you.
Well.

443
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:04,630
Of course he doesn't trust me.
He-he doesn't even know me.

444
00:41:04,730 --> 00:41:07,230
You have no idea how many chicken
dinners I've had with fathers...

445
00:41:07,332 --> 00:41:11,702
Just like yours just so they could get to know me.
We do not eat chicken.

446
00:41:11,803 --> 00:41:15,773
Yeah, well, whatever you do
eat, I'm gonna eat it too.

447
00:41:15,874 --> 00:41:19,584
You guys go to work in the
morning, I'm workin' too.

448
00:41:19,678 --> 00:41:21,678
I believe in you, Saleh.

449
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:25,120
I believe...
In what you can do.

450
00:41:25,216 --> 00:41:28,116
And once your father
understands that, he will too.

451
00:41:28,219 --> 00:41:30,089
Are you with me?

452
00:41:31,823 --> 00:41:34,093
Yes!
Yes, I'm with you.

453
00:41:34,192 --> 00:41:35,992
Let's do it!

454
00:41:37,228 --> 00:41:39,968
Who, whoa, whoa,
slow down, hey, hey!

455
00:41:40,065 --> 00:41:44,035
Come on! Hey! Fellas, fellas,
fellas, take it easy!

456
00:41:44,135 --> 00:41:46,495
Slow down!
Whoa!

457
00:41:50,308 --> 00:41:52,908
Fellas, slow, slow.
Come on, don't run!

458
00:41:53,011 --> 00:41:54,881
Whoa, whoa, hey!

459
00:42:01,587 --> 00:42:06,187
Whoa, whoa, you don't wanna do that!
Stop, stop, stop! Whoa!

460
00:42:06,291 --> 00:42:11,231
Come on, make... stop! You don't wanna go over there.
There's a McDonald's over there.

461
00:42:17,302 --> 00:42:22,612
Now, you give me a sump pump and a three-inch
pipe, and I'll cut your workload in half.

462
00:42:22,708 --> 00:42:27,178
But then we could not
visit with each other.

463
00:42:27,278 --> 00:42:30,318
We'll start...
With the fundamentals.

464
00:42:32,183 --> 00:42:36,553
Now, all I want you to do...

465
00:42:36,655 --> 00:42:41,255
Is bend your knees, just let
it roll off your fingertips.

466
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:45,059
You don't even have to jump.

467
00:42:47,666 --> 00:42:49,636
Nice shot.

468
00:42:49,735 --> 00:42:52,965
Jimmy. This is harimbo. He's not
so much with the shooting but...

469
00:42:53,071 --> 00:42:57,081
I defend like a Buffalo.
You smell like a Buffalo.

470
00:42:57,175 --> 00:43:00,645
Don't start, ntzuko. I'll
crush you like a cockroach.

471
00:43:00,746 --> 00:43:03,716
Excuse me.
I'll play.

472
00:43:03,815 --> 00:43:07,345
My sister's bridegroom-to-be. My
game is much larger than I look.

473
00:43:07,452 --> 00:43:10,362
I bet you say that
to all the girls.

474
00:43:10,455 --> 00:43:13,285
All right...
Let's get it on.

475
00:43:31,276 --> 00:43:33,106
Thank you.

476
00:43:34,713 --> 00:43:37,353
Sign you up for a St. Joe's
season ticket packet, sister?

477
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:41,848
I wouldn't uncork your pom-poms
just yet, Mr. Dolan.

478
00:43:51,062 --> 00:43:53,402
How 'bout your ring?

479
00:43:53,498 --> 00:43:56,398
Not if I was dying
of thirst. Forget it.

480
00:44:00,105 --> 00:44:03,735
Okay.
What is it?

481
00:44:03,842 --> 00:44:06,642
Goat's milk.

482
00:44:28,433 --> 00:44:31,773
I'll be right back.

483
00:44:31,870 --> 00:44:34,670
Nature is screaming.

484
00:44:37,308 --> 00:44:39,778
Ho!

485
00:44:39,878 --> 00:44:42,178
I'll be right back.

486
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:44,250
Are you okay?

487
00:44:44,349 --> 00:44:46,789
I'm fine.

488
00:44:46,885 --> 00:44:51,055
Case of the Winabi trots, I'd say.
I see.

489
00:44:55,927 --> 00:44:58,227
Ow!

490
00:44:58,329 --> 00:45:02,269
- Hey, sister.
- How ya' doin'?

491
00:45:02,367 --> 00:45:04,437
I got Christmas tree lights
from father O'Hara.

492
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:07,435
I thought maybe we could hook them up
to your generator for the wedding.

493
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:11,708
And I took you for a typically American,
selfishly opportunistic sports pimp.

494
00:45:11,810 --> 00:45:14,380
And all the while you're actually a
samaritan, and a handyman to boot.

495
00:45:14,479 --> 00:45:17,449
You're allowed to say "pimp"?
Only if I really mean it.

496
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:22,348
Hey, what is it that pisses you off so much about me?
Please, tell me, what?

497
00:45:22,453 --> 00:45:26,493
You're always playing a game, but you don't
have a clue who or what you're playing for.

498
00:45:26,591 --> 00:45:31,101
Is that right? Yes. You're frightened
if you stop playin', you'll disappear.

499
00:45:31,196 --> 00:45:35,266
You're doing a mile a minute, going absolutely nowhere.
The gospel according to Susan?

500
00:45:35,366 --> 00:45:38,066
Something wrong?

501
00:45:38,169 --> 00:45:41,509
At least I'm playin' instead of dropping
out and hiding out here in the wilderness.

502
00:45:44,075 --> 00:45:46,175
What did you say to me?

503
00:45:46,277 --> 00:45:50,417
Who do you think... You're kidding?
Do you know what the elders call you?

504
00:45:50,515 --> 00:45:53,175
"Nada ndimu."
The lemon nun.

505
00:45:53,284 --> 00:45:56,424
Well, there's a new Winabi word for
the village idiot. It's a "Dolan"!

506
00:45:58,389 --> 00:46:02,489
You know, you're just jealous. You're just jealous
because you know all the wonderful things...

507
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:06,063
I'm gonna be able to do for these
people once I take Saleh back with me.

508
00:46:06,164 --> 00:46:09,034
After you finish winning the
hearts and minds of the Winabi?

509
00:46:09,134 --> 00:46:13,404
- You don't think I'm gonna get Saleh to come back with me?
- You don't have a prayer!

510
00:46:13,504 --> 00:46:16,414
You see this ring, sister?

511
00:46:16,507 --> 00:46:20,177
This is a 1981
national championship ring.

512
00:46:20,278 --> 00:46:24,278
You can't buy
these rings, sister!

513
00:46:24,382 --> 00:46:27,552
Fourth quarter. We're down
seven points to Georgetown.

514
00:46:27,652 --> 00:46:31,122
Nineteen seconds on the clock.
Their ball!

515
00:46:32,323 --> 00:46:35,033
We won that game, sister!

516
00:46:35,126 --> 00:46:37,896
So don't talk to me
about a prayer!

517
00:47:14,299 --> 00:47:16,599
Uh-oh.

518
00:47:46,031 --> 00:47:48,301
Goddamn... button fly!

519
00:47:48,399 --> 00:47:50,239
Oh, no.

520
00:47:57,575 --> 00:48:00,575
Brace yourself...
Or I'm a dead goat!

521
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:05,150
Whoa!

522
00:48:31,009 --> 00:48:33,009
You.

523
00:48:33,111 --> 00:48:35,181
I...

524
00:48:40,151 --> 00:48:42,151
I... I...

525
00:48:42,253 --> 00:48:44,623
I... I... I mean, I...

526
00:48:44,722 --> 00:48:49,032
I don't know what to say.
You, you saved my life!

527
00:49:18,356 --> 00:49:20,586
Are you all right?

528
00:49:20,691 --> 00:49:24,601
Fine! Fine.
Never better.

529
00:49:24,695 --> 00:49:27,665
This is my sister, beisa. She
has something for your stomach.

530
00:49:31,669 --> 00:49:33,739
Mmm. Thank you.

531
00:49:40,311 --> 00:49:42,981
- Beisa.
- Beisa.

532
00:49:44,615 --> 00:49:48,085
What?

533
00:49:48,186 --> 00:49:50,756
She wants you to come
to her wedding to ntzuko.

534
00:49:50,855 --> 00:49:53,115
Great.
Thank you.
Yeah.

535
00:49:54,892 --> 00:49:58,102
Where is ntzuko? I haven't seen him around lately.
Not getting cold feet, is he?

536
00:49:58,196 --> 00:50:02,496
Ntzuko is far away. He is on a journey
he must make to become Winabi.

537
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:04,770
Beisa.

538
00:50:07,138 --> 00:50:09,538
Beisa asks if you're married?

539
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:12,040
Uh, no.

540
00:50:12,143 --> 00:50:15,013
No, I, uh...
Have a lot of girlfriends.

541
00:50:24,655 --> 00:50:27,255
What did she say?

542
00:50:27,358 --> 00:50:30,058
It's an old Winabi saying:

543
00:50:30,161 --> 00:50:33,201
"The hunt is fun... But does
not keep you warm at night."

544
00:50:33,298 --> 00:50:36,398
She's gonna keep ntzuko busy.
Yes.

545
00:50:36,501 --> 00:50:39,741
We're very happy
ntzuko is marrying her.

546
00:50:42,140 --> 00:50:44,180
What's wrong?

547
00:50:46,811 --> 00:50:50,281
Jimmy, there is something
my father hasn't told you.

548
00:50:52,283 --> 00:50:56,753
Over a year ago, a man named Nyaga
came to us, wanting to buy our land.

549
00:50:56,854 --> 00:51:01,064
Nyaga? That's the fat guy
who owns mingori? Yes.

550
00:51:01,159 --> 00:51:05,099
He wants to own our land too.
It's very rich with copper.

551
00:51:05,196 --> 00:51:07,726
But my father refused to sell.

552
00:51:07,832 --> 00:51:11,072
So Nyaga began attacking us
and stealing our cattle.

553
00:51:11,169 --> 00:51:13,569
Cattle are a big thing
for you guys, right?

554
00:51:13,671 --> 00:51:18,541
We depend on cattle. Without them,
we'll have to leave our land.

555
00:51:18,643 --> 00:51:20,813
Well...

556
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:24,681
Let's just hope cows aren't
considered a recruiting violation.

557
00:51:35,426 --> 00:51:39,196
You're beating me up on this. This is
the latest model camcorder they make.

558
00:51:39,297 --> 00:51:42,867
100,000 shillings
for the plane ticket,

559
00:51:42,967 --> 00:51:46,397
50,000 for the camcorder;
That's my best.

560
00:51:46,504 --> 00:51:51,344
You believe this guy? If you need cash
in a hurry, there's always a premium.

561
00:51:51,442 --> 00:51:54,382
It's true the world over.

562
00:51:54,479 --> 00:51:57,419
- Jimmy, are you sure you want to do this?
- All right,

563
00:51:57,515 --> 00:52:01,515
150,000 for the ticket,
100,000 for the camcorder.

564
00:52:01,619 --> 00:52:04,459
A hundred and twenty-five
for the ticket,

565
00:52:04,555 --> 00:52:07,115
50,000 for the camera.

566
00:52:07,225 --> 00:52:10,495
But you said we might have more.
Don't worry about it.

567
00:52:18,336 --> 00:52:21,806
You know, if I still owned
the video camera,

568
00:52:21,906 --> 00:52:25,636
I would want the battery
to go with it.

569
00:52:25,743 --> 00:52:28,513
- Wait a minute.
- When you need cash in a hurry,

570
00:52:28,613 --> 00:52:33,153
you gotta pay a premium.
It's true the world over.

571
00:52:33,251 --> 00:52:35,391
Good morning!

572
00:52:35,486 --> 00:52:38,256
Lose your traveler's checks,
coach Dolan?

573
00:52:38,356 --> 00:52:41,156
Oh.

574
00:52:41,259 --> 00:52:45,299
So, trying your hand
at cattle ranching, huh?

575
00:52:45,396 --> 00:52:48,596
That's none of your business.

576
00:52:48,699 --> 00:52:52,669
Everything in mingori...
Is my business.

577
00:52:52,770 --> 00:52:54,940
Not anymore.

578
00:52:55,039 --> 00:52:59,379
I strongly suggest that you take
your memories back to America...

579
00:52:59,477 --> 00:53:01,277
Now.

580
00:53:02,380 --> 00:53:05,280
Not until I'm done
seeing the sights.

581
00:53:26,937 --> 00:53:30,837
My father should have
seen that. Naftalanja!

582
00:53:30,941 --> 00:53:33,941
Naftalanja! By the way, what
the hell does that mean?

583
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:37,584
Naftalanja means the smell after a heavy rain.
But when you say it, it means...

584
00:53:37,682 --> 00:53:42,692
"Today my life starts fresh, and my troubles
are all behind me." Naftalanja, my friend.

585
00:53:42,787 --> 00:53:45,717
Saleh. Hey, what the
hell are you doing?

586
00:54:05,576 --> 00:54:07,576
Who was that?

587
00:54:07,678 --> 00:54:10,748
Halawi.
Who?

588
00:54:10,848 --> 00:54:13,378
My brother.
Your older brother?

589
00:54:13,484 --> 00:54:17,424
No one... you never said anything
about an older brother.

590
00:54:17,522 --> 00:54:22,892
When Nyaga first offered to buy our land, Halawi
tried to make a deal without my father knowing.

591
00:54:22,993 --> 00:54:26,633
He thought Nyaga was the future.
My father felt betrayed.

592
00:54:26,731 --> 00:54:30,401
So, he banished him.
He went to work for Nyaga.

593
00:54:30,501 --> 00:54:33,541
To my father,
Halawi does not exist.

594
00:54:34,872 --> 00:54:37,942
Man, I know how that feels.

595
00:54:54,759 --> 00:54:56,789
Moo, sister.

596
00:55:04,034 --> 00:55:06,544
Hey!

597
00:55:06,637 --> 00:55:09,937
They don't call us the St.
Joe's Bulls for nothing.

598
00:55:11,809 --> 00:55:14,879
Chief Urudu?

599
00:55:17,982 --> 00:55:20,592
And this must be
the lovely Mrs. Urudu.

600
00:55:20,685 --> 00:55:24,085
And may I say, you look way too
young to have a son Saleh's age.

601
00:55:24,188 --> 00:55:27,788
Yeah.

602
00:55:29,727 --> 00:55:34,057
These cattle are a gift to your tribe
from my tribe at St. Joseph's.

603
00:55:34,164 --> 00:55:38,774
I'm sure they'll come in handy now given the
upcoming expense of your daughter's wedding.

604
00:55:40,871 --> 00:55:46,611
I-I-i want you to know that my goal here is
to give to your village, not to take away.

605
00:55:49,814 --> 00:55:52,124
Jalang.

606
00:55:54,852 --> 00:55:57,722
Jalang, huh? Hey!

607
00:55:57,822 --> 00:56:02,392
Is that the same jalang that means
for eternity? The very same.

608
00:56:02,493 --> 00:56:05,463
They don't sound too happy.

609
00:56:05,563 --> 00:56:08,873
You just tried to buy the headman's
son for a herd of cattle.

610
00:56:08,966 --> 00:56:10,766
What'd you expect?

611
00:56:18,743 --> 00:56:21,053
Hello, Mr. Ray Fox.

612
00:56:21,145 --> 00:56:24,515
Foxie.
Foxie!

613
00:56:25,616 --> 00:56:28,516
Son-of-a-bitch!
He did it!

614
00:56:28,619 --> 00:56:31,559
- A blue chip big man.
- For 40 cows.

615
00:56:31,656 --> 00:56:33,616
This is Saleh.

616
00:56:33,724 --> 00:56:36,964
I'm a...
Dunkaholic.

617
00:56:37,061 --> 00:56:39,661
Jimmy told me
all about St. Joe's.

618
00:56:39,764 --> 00:56:43,834
Let's send him a couple hundred rabbits.
Maybe he can find us a point guard.

619
00:56:43,934 --> 00:56:46,844
Send him the cash!

620
00:56:46,937 --> 00:56:49,707
Make it express.

621
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:06,100
Watch out! Come here!
Come here! Hey!

622
01:00:06,203 --> 01:00:10,343
Hey! Come here!
Grab my arm!

623
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:13,810
It's all right. It's okay.

624
01:00:16,346 --> 01:00:20,746
Saleh!

625
01:01:17,441 --> 01:01:18,941
Sister.

626
01:01:20,010 --> 01:01:23,280
Everyone's alive,
Mr. Dolan.

627
01:01:47,872 --> 01:01:50,042
Where's everyone going?

628
01:01:50,140 --> 01:01:54,080
To a different place.
Away from mingori.

629
01:01:54,178 --> 01:01:58,418
You're just gonna walk away?
Quit? That's it?

630
01:02:00,350 --> 01:02:04,790
Jimmy, I am a Winabi.

631
01:02:04,889 --> 01:02:08,229
I must do what my leader says.
You are a leader.

632
01:02:08,325 --> 01:02:11,225
You understand that?

633
01:02:14,531 --> 01:02:16,171
No.

634
01:02:17,034 --> 01:02:19,844
No, I guess I don't.

635
01:02:19,937 --> 01:02:22,467
I'll walk you to mingori.

636
01:02:24,074 --> 01:02:26,214
To say good-bye.

637
01:02:48,999 --> 01:02:50,799
Andrews is dribbling,

638
01:02:50,901 --> 01:02:52,471
and tips it up to hatchinson
who's at the top of the key.

639
01:02:52,569 --> 01:02:55,239
Bill dribbles right,
pulls up a 22-footer. Yes!

640
01:03:08,385 --> 01:03:10,045
Nyaga!

641
01:03:45,923 --> 01:03:48,563
Your father
is reporting a crime.

642
01:03:48,658 --> 01:03:53,128
Mr. Basketball.
Mr. Big coach.

643
01:03:53,230 --> 01:03:56,070
So what's this?
Are you leaving us?

644
01:03:56,166 --> 01:03:59,466
Ahhh. We'll miss you,
Jimmy Dolan.

645
01:03:59,569 --> 01:04:04,409
But tell me. Aren't you sorry now that you
didn't let me sell you one of my players?

646
01:04:04,508 --> 01:04:08,148
Hey, I'm just waitin' for a bus.
I'll be outside.

647
01:04:08,245 --> 01:04:11,445
Who did you expect to find
in Winabi? Shaquille O'Neal?

648
01:04:15,352 --> 01:04:18,622
Hey, I'd take the Winabi women
over your starting five.

649
01:04:18,722 --> 01:04:22,062
What's the matter? You think
I cannot beat the women?

650
01:04:22,159 --> 01:04:24,589
Not on your best day, butthead.

651
01:04:39,709 --> 01:04:44,649
Thirty-two inch TV!
With remote.

652
01:04:51,221 --> 01:04:55,391
Wish to make a bet?

653
01:04:55,492 --> 01:04:58,562
We play basketball game.

654
01:04:58,662 --> 01:05:02,132
Mingori versus Winabi?

655
01:05:14,011 --> 01:05:17,051
What do you wish to play for?

656
01:05:17,147 --> 01:05:20,147
Quiet! I am still
headman of the Winabi.

657
01:05:21,718 --> 01:05:24,118
We bet all our land...

658
01:05:24,221 --> 01:05:27,621
Against the cattle
you have already stolen.

659
01:05:27,724 --> 01:05:31,564
And an agreement in front of the army
commander that you leave us alone forever.

660
01:05:34,598 --> 01:05:37,528
I hear nothing but a breeze.

661
01:05:37,634 --> 01:05:39,574
Father!

662
01:05:46,376 --> 01:05:51,316
You said with my son you can take
any four men and win everything.

663
01:05:51,415 --> 01:05:55,545
That was the truth or not? W-w-wait a minute.
No, it's not that simple.

664
01:05:55,652 --> 01:05:59,192
You will be our coach. I don't
think this is what you want.

665
01:06:01,158 --> 01:06:03,258
Shut up, Halawi.

666
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:07,100
So, it's a bet.
Count me out.

667
01:06:07,697 --> 01:06:09,497
Jimmy!

668
01:06:10,734 --> 01:06:13,274
I'll go back with you.

669
01:06:15,205 --> 01:06:17,065
What?

670
01:06:17,174 --> 01:06:21,284
If we win, I'll go back
to St. Joe's with you.

671
01:06:25,549 --> 01:06:28,089
Are you sure about this?

672
01:06:29,253 --> 01:06:31,393
Father, do you agree?

673
01:06:33,090 --> 01:06:35,330
No!

674
01:06:37,761 --> 01:06:40,531
- Yes.
- Wah!

675
01:06:40,630 --> 01:06:43,070
If we win, I get Saleh.

676
01:06:43,167 --> 01:06:45,067
No more jalang?

677
01:06:45,169 --> 01:06:48,339
You've all lost your minds! The
Winabi will be ground to dust!

678
01:06:48,438 --> 01:06:51,738
Get the army commander.
Tell him to bring the seal.

679
01:06:52,809 --> 01:06:55,549
Mingori versus Winabi.

680
01:06:55,645 --> 01:06:59,675
We make this bet official.

681
01:07:03,187 --> 01:07:05,157
All right. Come on.

682
01:07:05,255 --> 01:07:07,385
I'm definitely gonna need
St. George, father.

683
01:07:07,491 --> 01:07:10,491
He's the only guy we got who can bring
the ball up and get it to Saleh.

684
01:07:10,594 --> 01:07:14,404
Ruwala. Sololo. Yeah, you did
a good job with them. Opozo?

685
01:07:14,498 --> 01:07:17,128
There are two opozos.

686
01:07:20,104 --> 01:07:22,674
Well, I hate to break up a pair.

687
01:07:24,574 --> 01:07:26,644
Ntzuko.

688
01:07:44,494 --> 01:07:46,764
The guard has tits.

689
01:07:49,899 --> 01:07:53,599
All right. Listen up. When I
call your name, step forward.

690
01:07:53,703 --> 01:07:56,573
You call this off. And you call it off now!
Hey, slow down a minute.

691
01:07:56,673 --> 01:07:58,543
Now, sister, you...
Stuff it, father!

692
01:07:58,642 --> 01:08:01,152
Have you no conscience? Do you
realize what they're risking?

693
01:08:01,245 --> 01:08:03,545
Sometimes you gotta put it all
on the line and go for it.

694
01:08:03,647 --> 01:08:07,347
Spare me the beer commercial! These
people have been here since before time.

695
01:08:07,451 --> 01:08:10,691
You've been here a week, and
they're about to lose everything.

696
01:08:10,787 --> 01:08:15,227
Wrong, sister. They're about to gain their self-respect!
These people are not children.

697
01:08:15,325 --> 01:08:19,595
They made a decision for themselves, and I'm
just helping 'em. You do whatever you want.

698
01:08:21,598 --> 01:08:24,668
I just hope you're as good a coach
as you are a bullshit artist.

699
01:08:31,275 --> 01:08:33,835
You're allowed
to say "bullshit"?

700
01:08:35,912 --> 01:08:39,222
Only if I really mean it.

701
01:08:39,316 --> 01:08:41,386
Well, go on.

702
01:08:45,889 --> 01:08:49,729
Every day I thank the
lord she's on our side.

703
01:08:49,826 --> 01:08:53,596
All right, guys! Let's get to work.
We only got eight days.

704
01:08:55,432 --> 01:08:57,502
That's right.
Time your jump.

705
01:08:57,601 --> 01:09:00,371
I want you in the air
when the ball hits the board.

706
01:09:00,470 --> 01:09:03,610
Make mingori feel like
they're glued to the ground.

707
01:09:03,707 --> 01:09:05,877
That's good. Way to go.
Saleh, this is yours.

708
01:09:05,975 --> 01:09:07,635
Ow!

709
01:09:07,744 --> 01:09:09,854
Here we go.
Come on, move it, move it.

710
01:09:09,946 --> 01:09:12,776
High step.
Get 'em up. Get 'em up.

711
01:09:12,882 --> 01:09:16,892
Get 'em up. Get 'em up.
Get 'em up. Step, step, side.

712
01:09:16,986 --> 01:09:19,256
Side. Side. Side.

713
01:09:19,356 --> 01:09:22,656
Come on, get back, get back.
Let's go, let's go.

714
01:09:24,761 --> 01:09:28,931
All right, watch St. George.
Go right!

715
01:09:29,032 --> 01:09:31,402
And back! Up! Jump!

716
01:09:31,501 --> 01:09:34,771
Left! Right!

717
01:09:34,871 --> 01:09:37,641
Harimbo, your other right.

718
01:09:41,911 --> 01:09:44,651
Arms up! Arms up!
Arms up! No!

719
01:09:44,748 --> 01:09:46,648
Saleh, defense.

720
01:09:46,750 --> 01:09:49,490
Defense is more important
than breathing.

721
01:09:49,586 --> 01:09:53,516
We will win by shooting. Not by waving
our hands in the air like crazy people.

722
01:09:53,623 --> 01:09:57,263
You shoot. I'm gonna wave my hands
in the air like a crazy person.

723
01:09:59,363 --> 01:10:01,303
My turn.

724
01:10:01,398 --> 01:10:05,538
I'm mingori mining.
I've just stolen your cattle.

725
01:10:05,635 --> 01:10:08,505
Now I'm going after your family.

726
01:10:08,605 --> 01:10:10,935
That hoop is your boma.

727
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:14,440
If I get past you...
I'll kill you!

728
01:10:14,544 --> 01:10:19,454
Yeah. Right. Kill me.

729
01:10:19,549 --> 01:10:21,949
But next time,
do it without touching me.

730
01:10:22,051 --> 01:10:24,221
That's defense.

731
01:10:26,055 --> 01:10:28,725
What's wrong with them?

732
01:10:28,825 --> 01:10:32,725
You say defense is more important than breathing.
They took you by your word.

733
01:10:41,838 --> 01:10:44,568
Okay, you guys, let's go, let's go!
Come on, sharp turn!

734
01:10:44,674 --> 01:10:47,344
Last man in does it again!
That's right. Go! Go!

735
01:10:47,444 --> 01:10:50,354
Show me your stuff!
Show me your stuff!

736
01:10:53,116 --> 01:10:55,986
Come on, harimbo!
Keep moving! Come on!

737
01:10:56,085 --> 01:10:58,885
Come on!
Let's go! Go, go, go!

738
01:10:58,988 --> 01:11:01,488
Keep your hands up.
Don't be lazy.

739
01:11:01,591 --> 01:11:03,961
Come on. I've seen you guys throw Spears.
It's the same deal.

740
01:11:04,060 --> 01:11:07,900
It's a matter of life and death.
Remember: Pass, pass, pass.

741
01:11:07,997 --> 01:11:11,697
Or the coach will kick our ass.

742
01:11:16,506 --> 01:11:20,776
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

743
01:11:28,752 --> 01:11:32,622
Come on! Watch St. George.
He's the man, our playmaker.

744
01:11:32,722 --> 01:11:36,532
- Eyes on St. George!
- No, watch him!

745
01:11:39,028 --> 01:11:41,668
Ow! Ow, ow, ow!

746
01:11:43,132 --> 01:11:46,072
What is it? What's wrong?
Move over, guys.

747
01:11:49,773 --> 01:11:53,313
It's these ridiculous snow tire sandals.
Let itumbo see him.

748
01:11:53,410 --> 01:11:56,080
You will not cure him with itumbo's
chanting and antelope oils.

749
01:11:56,179 --> 01:11:58,779
Without him, we can't get
the ball out of the backcourt.

750
01:11:58,882 --> 01:12:01,822
He keeps off it,
he'll be playing in a month.

751
01:12:01,918 --> 01:12:04,788
Wow, that's just great.

752
01:12:04,888 --> 01:12:06,988
Jimmy.

753
01:12:08,592 --> 01:12:10,532
Where're you going?

754
01:12:12,929 --> 01:12:14,899
Home.

755
01:12:53,870 --> 01:12:57,970
I spoke to the elders. Can
any of 'em play guard?

756
01:12:58,074 --> 01:13:03,484
You can play guard.
We want you to play for us.

757
01:13:03,580 --> 01:13:05,580
Saleh.

758
01:13:05,682 --> 01:13:07,582
Wake up.

759
01:13:07,684 --> 01:13:10,594
You know the rules.
It's Winabi versus mingori.

760
01:13:10,687 --> 01:13:12,687
You must become one of us.

761
01:13:15,124 --> 01:13:19,904
Become?
You mean like ntzuko?

762
01:13:19,996 --> 01:13:22,466
Forget it.

763
01:13:24,968 --> 01:13:28,038
You're serious?

764
01:13:28,137 --> 01:13:30,767
Saleh.

765
01:13:37,146 --> 01:13:41,516
This is all my fault. I should
never have said yes. Damn!

766
01:13:41,618 --> 01:13:43,888
Why? Look, you
gotta call it off.

767
01:13:43,987 --> 01:13:46,517
It's over. It's finished.
You gotta call it off now.

768
01:13:46,623 --> 01:13:48,663
We would not even if we could.

769
01:13:48,758 --> 01:13:51,498
You don't get it, do ya?
You're gonna lose.

770
01:13:51,595 --> 01:13:53,595
Everything.
Cattle. Land.

771
01:13:53,697 --> 01:13:57,197
Didn't you say that the game is not
over until the fat lady sings?

772
01:13:57,300 --> 01:13:59,500
Forget what I said!
I'm nothing but talk!

773
01:13:59,603 --> 01:14:01,713
We can win with you.
You're a champion.

774
01:14:01,805 --> 01:14:06,075
No, I'm a has-been. I'm nothin'.
I'm an assistant coach.

775
01:14:06,175 --> 01:14:09,975
- You won a ring.
- But I blew out my knee!

776
01:14:10,079 --> 01:14:12,619
I blew out my knee!

777
01:14:43,947 --> 01:14:47,217
I believe in you, Jimmy Dolan.

778
01:14:47,316 --> 01:14:49,586
I would like to be your brother.

779
01:14:58,161 --> 01:15:00,131
Is that a fact?

780
01:15:00,229 --> 01:15:03,069
That is a fact.

781
01:15:14,744 --> 01:15:18,954
Well, assuming that I do this,

782
01:15:19,048 --> 01:15:22,848
can we skip the part with the
rap music and the large knife?

783
01:15:29,626 --> 01:15:31,626
Jalang.

784
01:15:53,416 --> 01:15:56,886
With no map?

785
01:15:56,986 --> 01:16:00,316
I follow the river
to a wall of wood,

786
01:16:00,423 --> 01:16:04,063
face the sunrise and look
to the air up there.

787
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:41,360
Come on. Now, this...
Th-this is ridiculous.

788
01:16:41,464 --> 01:16:43,704
I can't do this.

789
01:17:18,868 --> 01:17:22,768
It is said that you must leave
a large part of you there...

790
01:17:22,872 --> 01:17:26,112
So that you can take
a larger part of you away.

791
01:19:14,583 --> 01:19:18,753
Standing in that runway...

792
01:19:18,855 --> 01:19:23,985
For the first time... 12 guys
dressed in St. Joe's...

793
01:19:24,093 --> 01:19:29,003
Blue and gold, watching the lovely
cowbelles shake their pom-poms.

794
01:20:34,397 --> 01:20:40,467
Naftalanja!

795
01:21:21,510 --> 01:21:24,880
Not too low.

796
01:22:36,285 --> 01:22:38,515
All right, guys,
let's show 'em what we got!

797
01:22:38,621 --> 01:22:42,261
All right, hands in!

798
01:22:42,358 --> 01:22:44,258
Winabi! Winabi! Go!

799
01:22:49,132 --> 01:22:52,302
No, no, no.

800
01:22:52,401 --> 01:22:55,101
He can't play!
We made the rules.

801
01:22:55,204 --> 01:22:57,344
It's Winabi only!
Get him off the court!

802
01:22:57,440 --> 01:22:59,740
He is Winabi.

803
01:22:59,842 --> 01:23:02,482
Read it and weep.

804
01:23:07,750 --> 01:23:09,690
Let him play.

805
01:23:11,387 --> 01:23:14,187
With or without him,
it doesn't make any difference.

806
01:23:31,140 --> 01:23:33,080
That's two points!

807
01:23:35,778 --> 01:23:37,178
Let's go!

808
01:23:40,416 --> 01:23:43,486
Heads up!

809
01:23:45,388 --> 01:23:47,758
Yes! Yes!

810
01:24:07,676 --> 01:24:11,406
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

811
01:24:22,891 --> 01:24:25,361
- Hey!
- Get out! Get out! Play!

812
01:24:25,461 --> 01:24:29,571
Hey, you better watch it!

813
01:24:29,665 --> 01:24:34,165
Don't worry about it.
Don't worry about it.

814
01:24:42,545 --> 01:24:46,275
Yeah!

815
01:24:46,382 --> 01:24:48,382
Okay, boys!
Let's go! Let's go!

816
01:24:48,484 --> 01:24:53,394
Mingori! Mingori! Mingori!

817
01:24:53,489 --> 01:24:56,589
Mingori! Mingori!

818
01:24:56,692 --> 01:25:00,202
- Mmm! Beautiful!
- Ohh!

819
01:25:00,296 --> 01:25:03,126
Winabi! Winabi!

820
01:25:03,232 --> 01:25:06,442
Winabi! Winabi!

821
01:25:06,535 --> 01:25:09,435
Winabi! Winabi!

822
01:25:09,538 --> 01:25:12,338
Back door, Saleh!

823
01:25:16,679 --> 01:25:19,479
- Ohhh!
- Foul!

824
01:25:23,586 --> 01:25:26,186
That was a charge!

825
01:25:29,958 --> 01:25:33,558
It's all right.
I'm all right.

826
01:25:38,301 --> 01:25:40,501
Beisa!

827
01:25:40,603 --> 01:25:42,873
Beisa!
Beisa! Beisa!

828
01:25:42,971 --> 01:25:46,481
Beisa! Beisa! Beisa, you bring the ball down.
All right? Saleh, post up low.

829
01:25:46,575 --> 01:25:50,745
Look to him. But if you get open,
let's see that sweet shot.

830
01:25:50,846 --> 01:25:52,816
Jimmy?
Foxie.

831
01:25:52,915 --> 01:25:55,815
You came. All right! Come on!
Play! Play hard!

832
01:25:55,918 --> 01:25:58,488
I didn't know you
wanted my job that bad.

833
01:26:06,695 --> 01:26:10,695
Come on, ref, watch his hands!
He's all over her. Hey, come on!

834
01:26:17,273 --> 01:26:19,443
Yes!
That's him.
That's our guy?

835
01:26:19,542 --> 01:26:22,412
Tell me you've got him locked up, Jimmy.
Tell me you've got him locked up.

836
01:26:22,511 --> 01:26:26,251
Only if we win.
Go Winabi!

837
01:26:41,297 --> 01:26:45,297
Ohhh!

838
01:26:50,473 --> 01:26:53,713
She's out? What are you, blind?
Get a dog!

839
01:26:57,413 --> 01:27:00,553
All right, I'm goin' in.

840
01:27:18,367 --> 01:27:22,607
Rhino! Rhino!

841
01:27:34,850 --> 01:27:38,720
Winabi! Winabi!
Winabi!

842
01:27:38,821 --> 01:27:42,431
Winabi! Winabi!
Winabi! Winabi!

843
01:27:42,525 --> 01:27:45,325
Winabi! Winabi!

844
01:27:45,428 --> 01:27:49,628
Lace him up, boys. Courtesy of
the east African bingo project.

845
01:27:49,732 --> 01:27:53,372
If you don't stop playing, Mr. Dolan,
there may be nothing left to tape.

846
01:27:53,469 --> 01:27:56,339
You're going to injure yourself
permanently. Yeah, yeah.

847
01:27:56,439 --> 01:28:00,039
Jimmy. Please, no more.
Where's my brace?

848
01:28:00,142 --> 01:28:02,512
Jimmy.
What?

849
01:28:02,611 --> 01:28:05,381
I'll go back with you
whether we win or not.

850
01:28:10,353 --> 01:28:12,363
What do you want?

851
01:28:12,455 --> 01:28:15,015
I want to win.

852
01:28:15,123 --> 01:28:17,933
Yeah, me too.

853
01:28:18,026 --> 01:28:21,496
This isn't about you
going back with me anymore.

854
01:28:21,597 --> 01:28:23,927
The deal's off.

855
01:28:24,032 --> 01:28:27,742
When this is over, you do
whatever you want, all right?

856
01:28:30,606 --> 01:28:34,806
All right. Jimmy! You
heard what you just said?

857
01:28:34,910 --> 01:28:37,950
We need this kid
at St. Joe's.

858
01:28:38,046 --> 01:28:42,546
Foxie, this
is not St. Joe's.

859
01:28:42,651 --> 01:28:45,691
All right, all right, you guys.
Gather 'round. Listen up.

860
01:28:45,788 --> 01:28:49,688
Saleh, come here. Ruwala, sololo, I
want you guys to get into the flow.

861
01:28:49,792 --> 01:28:53,062
I want to open up this game offensively.
Look, mifundo is a brute,

862
01:28:53,161 --> 01:28:55,901
but you can outthink him,
you can outsmart him.

863
01:28:55,998 --> 01:29:00,038
Hey, guys, we're down 14 points.
We're playing at home.

864
01:29:00,135 --> 01:29:03,705
And we got new shoes. Let's
send mingori back to the mines.

865
01:29:03,806 --> 01:29:05,706
Yes!
What did you say?

866
01:29:05,808 --> 01:29:07,578
- Yes!
- I can't hear you.

867
01:29:07,676 --> 01:29:09,846
Yes!

868
01:29:34,703 --> 01:29:36,973
Go, Saleh!

869
01:29:37,072 --> 01:29:39,742
Way to go!

870
01:29:45,147 --> 01:29:48,447
All right, get your man.
Tough "d"!

871
01:29:49,084 --> 01:29:52,624
Come on, mifundo!

872
01:29:57,526 --> 01:29:59,626
Saleh, he's all over you!

873
01:29:59,728 --> 01:30:02,568
Is he stronger than you?
Is he tougher than you?

874
01:30:02,665 --> 01:30:05,765
Winabi! Winabi!

875
01:30:08,170 --> 01:30:11,170
Here.

876
01:30:22,985 --> 01:30:25,845
All right. Hold on.
Take it easy.

877
01:30:25,954 --> 01:30:29,194
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Get off him, man!

878
01:31:04,292 --> 01:31:07,562
- Time-out! Time!
- Mingori's chokin'!

879
01:31:22,310 --> 01:31:24,580
Look out, Saleh!
He's goin' baseline!

880
01:31:26,749 --> 01:31:30,019
- Yes! Yes!
- That's it!

881
01:31:50,606 --> 01:31:52,736
That was a foul!

882
01:31:52,841 --> 01:31:55,111
What are ya doin'?
That was a hatchet job.

883
01:31:55,210 --> 01:31:58,250
Careful.
No weight on this leg.

884
01:31:58,346 --> 01:32:02,916
Who are we gonna use now?
Jimmy, who do you want?

885
01:32:03,018 --> 01:32:06,018
I don't know. We have nobody. Come
on, Jimmy, we gotta use somebody.

886
01:32:06,121 --> 01:32:08,761
We need a point guard.

887
01:32:23,606 --> 01:32:26,306
Halawi! Halawi!

888
01:32:26,408 --> 01:32:29,908
Halawi! Halawi!

889
01:32:30,012 --> 01:32:33,322
Halawi! Halawi!

890
01:32:33,415 --> 01:32:35,975
- Halawi!
- Huh?

891
01:32:36,084 --> 01:32:39,324
Halawi! Halawi!

892
01:32:42,725 --> 01:32:45,055
I am playing for Winabi.

893
01:32:49,932 --> 01:32:54,572
No! He cannot play for Winabi.
He doesn't belong here.

894
01:33:04,780 --> 01:33:06,750
Hey!

895
01:33:12,888 --> 01:33:15,318
He plays for Winabi.

896
01:33:19,161 --> 01:33:22,831
Hey! Your brother.
Can he play?

897
01:33:22,931 --> 01:33:25,331
Does a zebra have stripes?

898
01:33:43,385 --> 01:33:46,185
Come on!

899
01:33:46,288 --> 01:33:49,728
Let's move! Let's move the ball!
Pass! Pass!

900
01:34:06,374 --> 01:34:08,414
Clear.

901
01:34:15,050 --> 01:34:17,890
Halawi!

902
01:34:22,157 --> 01:34:24,087
Mamambo.

903
01:35:09,805 --> 01:35:12,065
Come on, get in.

904
01:35:30,225 --> 01:35:33,895
Come on! Arms up!
Guard 'em! Guard 'em!

905
01:35:37,099 --> 01:35:39,069
Time! Time!

906
01:35:39,167 --> 01:35:41,797
- You saw it! He touched it!
- Time!

907
01:35:41,904 --> 01:35:44,474
- Number 30. You saw it!
- He touched it! Yeah!

908
01:35:44,572 --> 01:35:46,982
Time, time, time, time!

909
01:35:47,075 --> 01:35:49,305
All right.
Come on, come on.

910
01:35:49,411 --> 01:35:53,521
All right. Listen up, you guys.
Give me your eyes.

911
01:35:53,615 --> 01:35:57,515
We're gonna call this play
"warthog in the weeds."

912
01:35:57,619 --> 01:35:59,819
All right, Halawi,

913
01:35:59,922 --> 01:36:02,762
I want you to take the ball out
of bounds and pass it to ruwala.

914
01:36:02,858 --> 01:36:05,058
Everyone's lined up
on the free throw line.

915
01:36:05,160 --> 01:36:08,400
The object here is to draw
your man away from Saleh.

916
01:36:08,496 --> 01:36:10,396
I want him isolated.
Alone.

917
01:36:10,498 --> 01:36:12,968
One on one
with the big ugly guy.

918
01:36:13,068 --> 01:36:15,138
It's up to you, my man.

919
01:36:15,237 --> 01:36:17,937
All right, here we go.
Hands in. One...

920
01:36:18,040 --> 01:36:20,010
Two... three...

921
01:36:20,108 --> 01:36:22,408
Naftalanja!

922
01:36:22,510 --> 01:36:26,550
Forty-one seconds left. The Winabi's
have got no time-out remaining.

923
01:36:43,598 --> 01:36:46,898
You've got lots of time now.
Twenty, twenty.

924
01:36:47,002 --> 01:36:49,272
Lots of time.

925
01:36:56,078 --> 01:36:57,448
Come on!

926
01:37:18,266 --> 01:37:20,396
Jimmy Dolan "shake and bake."

927
01:37:36,218 --> 01:37:39,418
That's it!

928
01:37:42,257 --> 01:37:45,357
Winabi! Winabi!

929
01:38:06,181 --> 01:38:08,121
- Yes!
- Yes!

930
01:38:17,192 --> 01:38:20,202
Yeah!

931
01:38:28,403 --> 01:38:32,543
Winabi! Winabi! Winabi!

932
01:38:32,640 --> 01:38:35,610
Winabi! Winabi!

933
01:38:35,710 --> 01:38:38,510
Halawi!

934
01:38:38,613 --> 01:38:42,383
Winabi! Winabi!
Winabi!

935
01:39:00,402 --> 01:39:02,502
Sister!
You're allowed to kiss?

936
01:39:02,604 --> 01:39:05,174
Only if I really mean it.

937
01:39:11,413 --> 01:39:14,023
