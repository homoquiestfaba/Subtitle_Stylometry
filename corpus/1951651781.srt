KARL: A little higher, please.

342
00:31:43,334 --> 00:31:46,701
You won't last long. They never do.

343
00:31:48,006 --> 00:31:51,407

Good girl.

344

I must say,
you're the prettiest one he's had.

346
00:31:58,716 --> 00:32:01,344
- You should really come and work for me.
- Who are you?

347
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:05,014
I'm Karl van Beethoven, the nephew.

348
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:08,058
- You're the one who...
- Who what? Ruined his life?

349
00:32:08,126 --> 00:32:11,357
Made it impossible for him
to compose for years?

350
00:32:11,829 --> 00:32:15,458
The ungrateful little brat
who only borrows money?

351
00:32:15,533 --> 00:32:17,330
Yes, that's me.

352
00:32:17,402 --> 00:32:19,768
I was going to say, the one he dotes on.

353
00:32:19,837 --> 00:32:24,137
KARL: Dotes on? Yes, in his dotage.

354
00:32:24,676 --> 00:32:28,271
- How long have you been working for him?
- Since last night.

developed kind.

359
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:44,857
Since I started this job,
I've been mistaken for a nurse,

360
00:32:44,929 --> 00:32:47,090
a maid and now a prostitute!

361
00:32:47,398 --> 00:32:49,730
- No more!
- Jesus, then what the hell are you?

362
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:51,393
- I'm his copyist.
- Copyist?

363
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:53,562
- Yes.
- Then why are you cleaning?

364
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:56,072
Because I can't work
under these conditions,

365
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:59,109
- and I doubt that he can.
- Are you joking? He lives this way.

366
00:32:59,177 --> 00:33:00,439
- Yes, and you let him.
- Let him?

367
00:33:00,511 --> 00:33:04,470
You can't stop him from doing anything.
He's a force of nature.

368
00:33:05,049 --> 00:33:09,042
Just ask my poor mother.
For Christ's sake, ask me.

369
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,520
Trying to force me
to become a pianist, like him.

370
00:33:11,589 --> 00:33:16,288
- What's wrong with being a pianist?
- What's... I have no talent.

371
00:33:17,428 --> 00:33:21,421
But still he thunders on.
He tears down everything in his path.

372
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:24,332
He destroys anyone he meets
with his monumental ego.

373
00:33:24,402 --> 00:33:28,099
"Oh, I am Ludwig van Beethoven,
and you, you are nothing."

374
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:30,333
At least not by the time
he's done with you.

375
00:33:32,377 --> 00:33:36,040
- I will wait for your uncle outside.
- No, no, no. I'm sorry, I'll go.

I'm not what everybody
says about me, Miss Holtz.

380
00:33:47,558 --> 00:33:49,822
He's trying to destroy my mother.

381
00:33:50,728 --> 00:33:55,062
I mean, for years he's kept me from her
so that he could, well, possess me.

382
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:57,968
Because he loves you.

383
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:01,133
Yes, but I can't bear it.

384
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:04,038
Everybody is used to
being despised by him.

to be the only one who is loved by him?

And you should hear him play
the piano, Anna Holtz.

if you want to go on stage.

I don't want to go on stage.

Schlemmer. I've arranged for Krenski
to send him some pickled carp.

402

That will put him back in the pink.

- Well, you then, Karl. Come with me.
- I'm a bit short this month, Uncle.

- What?
- I say, I'm a bit short.

That was a joke, Anna Holtz. A family joke.
We have lots of good jokes in our family.

00:43:50,928 --> 00:43:52,293
(SIGHS)

508
00:44:25,529 --> 00:44:27,053
Good day, ma'am.

509
00:44:27,131 --> 00:44:28,564
Glorious, isn't it?

510
00:44:29,266 --> 00:44:30,699
The quiet.

511
00:44:31,869 --> 00:44:34,929
He's been out all day, since before dawn.

512
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:38,637
Walks in the woods, you know,
out in Kahlenberg.

513
00:44:38,909 --> 00:44:40,433
I have no windows.

514
00:44:40,611 --> 00:44:43,603
This is the only chance I get
to open my door.

515
00:44:44,081 --> 00:44:46,845
That must be terrible,
to be shut in all the time.

516
00:44:47,751 --> 00:44:49,946
I live for these moments,

517
00:44:50,587 --> 00:44:52,714
these peaceful hours.

518
00:44:53,257 --> 00:44:56,283
- Excuse me, but why don't you move?
- Move?

519
00:44:57,828 --> 00:45:02,856
I am the next-door neighbor
of Ludwig van Beethoven.

520
00:45:03,333 --> 00:45:08,270
I hear all the pieces before anyone,
before they're premiered.

521
00:45:08,839 --> 00:45:14,141
The whole of Vienna envies me.
I've been with him since the 7th.

522
00:45:15,412 --> 00:45:16,902
(HUMMING)

523
00:45:32,096 --> 00:45:33,927
Wonderful stuff.

524
00:45:33,997 --> 00:45:36,295
The new one's coming along, isn't it?

525
00:45:36,366 --> 00:45:38,891
- Very well, thank you.
- Keep him at it.

526
00:45:39,369 --> 00:45:40,597
I will.

527
00:45:55,853 --> 00:45:58,014
- Excuse me!
- Christ.

528
00:46:00,224 --> 00:46:01,919
What are you doing?

529
00:46:01,992 --> 00:46:04,483
You're the one stealing from him,
aren't you?

530
00:46:04,561 --> 00:46:07,189
- It's not stealing.
- What is it, then?

531
00:46:07,931 --> 00:46:09,694
It's what he owes me.

532
00:46:10,734 --> 00:46:13,202
He's trying to arrange a recital for me.

533
00:46:14,138 --> 00:46:15,662
Do you understand?

534
00:46:16,006 --> 00:46:18,099
I don't want to play the goddamn piano.

535
00:46:18,175 --> 00:46:21,338
- Put back the money.
- No, I can't.

536
00:46:21,912 --> 00:46:25,040
I have debts,
debts I owe to very dangerous people.

537
00:46:25,115 --> 00:46:28,744
I mean, you have no idea.
You're just a girl. Sheltered.

538
00:46:28,819 --> 00:46:30,719
Vienna is not a healthy place.

539
00:46:31,421 --> 00:46:35,084
You know, they say it's the center
of culture, of civilization...

540
00:46:35,425 --> 00:46:40,055
Karl, give me the money.
I'll put it back for you.

541
00:46:40,397 --> 00:46:42,194
- I can't.
- Give me the money!

542
00:46:42,266 --> 00:46:44,427
I'm not a bad person, Miss Holtz.

543
00:46:44,501 --> 00:46:47,231
I just can't stop,
and I need this money now.

544
00:46:48,505 --> 00:46:50,473
Oh, my God. He's coming.

545
00:46:50,574 --> 00:46:51,871
Karl!

546
00:46:52,876 --> 00:46:54,070
Karl!

547
00:46:55,712 --> 00:46:56,701
KARL: Uncle.

548
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:58,077
BEETHOVEN: Good morning, Karl.
Good morning.

549
00:46:58,148 --> 00:46:59,376
I'm late.

550
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:03,347
- I've set the recital a week from Tuesday.
- Okay.

551
00:47:06,156 --> 00:47:07,521
(HORSE NEIGHING)

552
00:47:14,865 --> 00:47:17,834
Anna Holtz, isn't life a beautiful thing?

553
00:47:18,168 --> 00:47:20,864
I was walking out at Kahlenberg.
Do you ever go there?

554
00:47:20,938 --> 00:47:23,964
Nature. Man lives for nature.

555
00:47:24,708 --> 00:47:28,303
If you ever really want to compose,
you must take rooms at Kahlenberg.

556
00:47:28,378 --> 00:47:30,573
I saw Karl. I met him on the stairs.

557
00:47:32,816 --> 00:47:33,874
Yes.

558
00:47:33,951 --> 00:47:37,478
Did he tell you? I've arranged
a recital for him. He's very excited.

559
00:47:37,588 --> 00:47:38,816
Maestro.

560
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:43,159
- He doesn't want to do the recital.
- What?

561
00:47:44,661 --> 00:47:48,620
- He doesn't want to do the recital.
- Nonsense. He said that to you?

562
00:47:49,099 --> 00:47:52,227
I just saw him. He said nothing of the kind.
He didn't come here for that?

563
00:47:53,270 --> 00:47:55,761
No. He came here for money.

564
00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:58,637
Money? He didn't ask me for any money.

565
00:48:07,451 --> 00:48:09,942
Are you saying that he stole from me,
that he came here to take my money?

566
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:13,387
It's the cleaning woman.
I've been meaning to sack her for weeks.

567
00:48:13,457 --> 00:48:16,085
Karl, a thief?
Why would you say such a thing?

568
00:48:16,159 --> 00:48:18,024
Because I know that you love him.

569
00:48:18,095 --> 00:48:21,587
Love? And what would a girl your age
understand about love?

570
00:48:24,434 --> 00:48:27,767
My God, you're in love, aren't you?
Who? Let me guess.

571
00:48:28,272 --> 00:48:30,467
Your professor of counterpoint.

572
00:48:31,208 --> 00:48:34,644
Young, good looking,
frilly-shirted, fifth-rate Rossini.

573
00:48:34,811 --> 00:48:36,745
- He's an engineer.
- Engineer?

574
00:48:36,813 --> 00:48:39,873
Yes. He's designing a bridge
for the Archduke's competition.

575
00:48:39,950 --> 00:48:42,851
One of our men of steel.
One of our new iron men.

576
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:45,445
- Martin is an artist.
- Martin? Well...

577
00:48:46,890 --> 00:48:51,884
I'm very aware of Martin's kind of artists.
They're slide rules without souls.

578
00:48:53,664 --> 00:48:55,723
You shouldn't be his lover,
you should be his enemy.

579
00:48:55,799 --> 00:48:57,198
I'm not his lover.

580
00:48:57,367 --> 00:49:00,336
So, that's why you came to Vienna?
To chase a man.

581
00:49:00,837 --> 00:49:03,931
I came to Vienna because God
wishes me to be a composer.

582
00:49:04,007 --> 00:49:07,340
Well, then, he made a serious mistake
in making you a woman.

583
00:49:09,212 --> 00:49:10,873
You should not talk about God that way.

584
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:14,714
I assure you, Anna Holtz, the Almighty
and I understand each other perfectly.

585
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:16,776
We're like two bears in one den.

586
00:49:16,853 --> 00:49:20,448
We growl and snarl and claw
at one another.

587
00:49:21,058 --> 00:49:22,889
Sleep at each other's backs.

588
00:49:23,293 --> 00:49:24,920
No one dares come near us.

589
00:49:24,995 --> 00:49:27,122
That sounds like a very Ionely religion.

590
00:49:27,197 --> 00:49:28,926
Loneliness is my religion.

591
00:49:33,837 --> 00:49:36,635
Why aren't you working?
The premiere is tomorrow night.

592
00:50:01,531 --> 00:50:02,759
(SIGHING)

593
00:50:08,205 --> 00:50:12,699
Do you think I ought to
cancel Karl's recital?

594
00:50:13,543 --> 00:50:16,876
- Yes, Maestro.
- He wants to join the Army, you know?

595
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:22,141
Abandon music, become a cavalryman.
He always loved horses.

596
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:25,979
Perhaps that would be for the best.

597
00:50:27,224 --> 00:50:28,657
Yes, perhaps.

598
00:50:31,161 --> 00:50:32,492
Perhaps.

599
00:50:47,844 --> 00:50:50,472
Why are you so frank with me,
Anna Holtz?

600
00:50:50,847 --> 00:50:52,542
Because I esteem you
as one of the greatest...

601
00:50:52,616 --> 00:50:54,743
(SHOUTING) Don't flatter me!

602
00:51:01,658 --> 00:51:03,922
Why do you wish to be near me?

603
00:51:06,263 --> 00:51:07,753
Because...

604
00:51:10,434 --> 00:51:13,801
Because it makes me believe
that I, too, can write music.

605
00:51:16,373 --> 00:51:17,601
Music?
