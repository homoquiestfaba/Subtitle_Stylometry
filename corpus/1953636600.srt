1
00:03:51,764 --> 00:03:54,266
My brother's right.

2
00:03:56,436 --> 00:03:58,737
You're a good fighter.

3
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:06,945
Don't spend it all in one place.

4
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:25,297
Time to meet the devil.

5
00:05:03,703 --> 00:05:06,738
Are those women?

6
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:09,341
Yeah, 50 percent.

7
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:15,414
I'm looking for a girl.
A young girl.

8
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:18,317
I want to fuck
a 14-year-old.

9
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:21,353
Only what you see.

10
00:05:21,355 --> 00:05:25,057
Let me ask you a question.

11
00:05:25,059 --> 00:05:27,359
You got a daughter?

12
00:05:28,394 --> 00:05:30,562
Bring her in.

13
00:05:30,564 --> 00:05:34,499
I'll pay you 15,000 baht.

14
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:37,602
No, no, no. Sorry.

15
00:05:55,655 --> 00:05:57,356
Hello.

16
00:05:57,358 --> 00:06:01,660
Hey, not do like that.
Come on. Oh...

17
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:51,569
It's about your brother.

18
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:56,374
Billy's dead.

19
00:19:57,329 --> 00:19:58,863
I'm checking in.

20
00:19:59,898 --> 00:20:02,567
One moment, please.

21
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:14,745
I'm afraid the room wouldn't be ready
until four o'clock. It's a policy.

22
00:20:16,481 --> 00:20:18,849
Get your manager.

23
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:31,462
He'll be here in a minute.

24
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:40,838
What's your problem?

25
00:20:47,713 --> 00:20:50,581
Good morning, madam.
How may I help you?

26
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:52,750
Listen to me.

27
00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:55,453
I have just traveled 10,000
miles to see the corpse

28
00:20:55,455 --> 00:20:58,623
of my first-born son.
I haven't slept in 30 hours.

29
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:01,792
And this bitch says
I can't have my room.

30
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:07,151
Ask him why he
killed my brother.

31
00:27:23,375 --> 00:27:25,943
Did you miss me?

32
00:27:30,048 --> 00:27:32,983
I missed you so much.

33
00:27:54,205 --> 00:27:57,741
Did you get the guy
that did it?

34
00:27:59,377 --> 00:28:02,279
How did you kill him?

35
00:28:04,249 --> 00:28:06,884
I let him go.

36
00:28:09,921 --> 00:28:12,756
Get the door.

37
00:28:16,728 --> 00:28:19,363
Are you out
of your fucking mind?

38
00:28:19,365 --> 00:28:22,433
Some cunt killed your brother
and you let him go?

39
00:28:22,435 --> 00:28:25,269
It's a little more complicated
than that, Mother.

40
00:28:25,271 --> 00:28:28,105
Meaning what, exactly?

41
00:28:29,908 --> 00:28:33,911
Billy raped and killed
a 16-year-old girl.

42
00:28:36,948 --> 00:28:39,416
I'm sure he had his reasons.

43
00:28:39,418 --> 00:28:41,719
Now sit!

44
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:06,143
I know it's hard
for you emotionally.

45
00:29:07,345 --> 00:29:13,217
You've lost your brother.
Don't worry.

46
00:29:13,219 --> 00:29:17,955
I'll take care of the yellow
nigger who killed my son.

47
00:29:17,957 --> 00:29:20,224
It's too much for you.

48
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:27,231
Now get up and kiss your mother.

49
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:23,120
If you ever come back,

50
00:30:23,122 --> 00:30:25,389
I'll kill you.

51
00:30:38,469 --> 00:30:42,973
- Is it done?
- Yeah.

52
00:30:44,309 --> 00:30:46,944
How's business?

53
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:54,985
Yeah, it's OK.

54
00:30:57,522 --> 00:31:01,058
I could do with having
Billy back, though.

55
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:04,261
Isn't Julian taking care
of everything?

56
00:31:04,263 --> 00:31:07,898
He hasn't told you, has he?

57
00:31:09,567 --> 00:31:13,237
There was
someone else involved -

58
00:31:13,239 --> 00:31:15,539
when Billy was killed.

59
00:31:15,541 --> 00:31:20,878
- Who?
- Some cop.

60
00:31:22,614 --> 00:31:24,882
Don't worry.

61
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:27,651
I'll find him.

62
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:31,989
And then we'll kill him.

63
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:36,493
Good.

64
00:34:42,513 --> 00:34:45,415
She doesn't
know what to think.

65
00:34:45,417 --> 00:34:47,818
He says
he didn't see it, Mum.

66
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:51,755
A foreigner called up Liang
and spoke English.

67
00:34:51,757 --> 00:34:55,725
Then he went with him
and took the phone with him.

68
00:35:03,468 --> 00:35:08,405
Hey, Julian.
The cops want to see you.

69
00:35:10,508 --> 00:35:14,311
- What do they want?
- Probably money.

70
00:35:14,313 --> 00:35:17,514
- You want me to ask how much?
- No, I'll go.

71
00:35:21,652 --> 00:35:24,154
You're Julian?

72
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:29,726
- Do you know Choi Yan Lee?
- Who?

73
00:35:29,728 --> 00:35:33,330
Your brother killed
his daughter.

74
00:35:34,499 --> 00:35:37,367
What's that have to do with me?

75
00:35:38,603 --> 00:35:41,471
Choi Yan Lee was murdered.

76
00:35:51,249 --> 00:35:55,919
- When?
- Yesterday.

77
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:29,032
You can't go around
killing cops anymore.

78
00:39:29,034 --> 00:39:32,135
How much do you want?

79
00:39:32,137 --> 00:39:35,472
It's not about the money.

80
00:39:35,474 --> 00:39:37,841
What's in it for me?

81
00:39:39,844 --> 00:39:44,848
I have five kilos of blow arriving
Friday. I need someone to help me move it.

82
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:49,419
You got any questions,
you ask him.

83
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:52,789
And what about Julian?

84
00:39:55,659 --> 00:39:57,494
Don't worry about Julian.

85
00:39:57,496 --> 00:40:02,432
- Are you in or out?
- I'm in.

86
00:40:47,578 --> 00:40:50,547
I'd like you
to meet my mother.

87
00:40:54,919 --> 00:40:58,455
I want us to pretend
that we're a couple.

88
00:41:02,827 --> 00:41:04,994
Can you do that?

89
00:41:27,885 --> 00:41:30,587
Will you wear this?

90
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:22,939
So, tell me, Mai.
What line of work are you in?

91
00:42:22,941 --> 00:42:26,676
- I'm an entertainer.
- An entertainer?

92
00:42:26,678 --> 00:42:32,215
And how many cocks can you entertain with
that cute little cum-Dumpster of yours?

93
00:42:36,854 --> 00:42:39,756
What do you think
of his line of work?

94
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:44,260
I'm not talking
about the fag boxing club.

95
00:42:44,262 --> 00:42:48,965
I'm talking about
where the money comes from.

96
00:42:48,967 --> 00:42:50,867
You know what he does, right?

97
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:54,904
He deals drugs, Mai.

98
00:42:54,906 --> 00:42:58,308
Heroin, cocaine. That's
where the money comes from.

99
00:42:58,310 --> 00:43:01,578
That's how he can afford
to pay you to fuck him.

100
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:10,019
Oh, great. I'll get the crab.
He'll have the spicy chicken.

101
00:43:10,021 --> 00:43:15,892
And May here will have a salad
with the dressing on the side.

102
00:43:15,894 --> 00:43:18,361
It's Mai.

103
00:43:22,633 --> 00:43:25,201
I'm sorry.

104
00:43:25,203 --> 00:43:29,105
I apologize for my behavior.

105
00:43:29,107 --> 00:43:34,677
It's just that
I'm a little upset.

106
00:43:34,679 --> 00:43:37,647
I have lost my first son.

107
00:43:41,986 --> 00:43:45,188
I'm sorry for that.

108
00:43:45,190 --> 00:43:47,256
Thank you.

109
00:43:48,659 --> 00:43:52,829
It's good to know someone cares.

110
00:43:52,831 --> 00:43:58,234
'Cause I swear to God, sometimes I think Julian
hated Billy. Maybe "hate" is the wrong word.

111
00:43:58,236 --> 00:44:01,704
But you were always
jealous of him.

112
00:44:01,706 --> 00:44:07,343
You know the way boys are, May.
Competitive.

113
00:44:07,345 --> 00:44:12,015
And what with Billy being the older
brother and having a bigger cock...

114
00:44:12,017 --> 00:44:15,785
Julian's was never small,
but Billy's was...

115
00:44:15,787 --> 00:44:18,755
Oh, it was enormous.

116
00:44:21,025 --> 00:44:23,426
How can you compete with that?

117
00:44:28,866 --> 00:44:33,670
Billy was everything
Julian wanted to be.

118
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:39,942
Is that not true?

119
00:44:43,881 --> 00:44:47,817
'Cause let me tell you,
if the tables were turned,

120
00:44:47,819 --> 00:44:50,053
your brother would
have found your killer

121
00:44:50,055 --> 00:44:54,357
and brought me his head
on a fucking platter!

122
00:44:54,359 --> 00:45:00,296
And you just sit there thinking
he got what he deserved!

123
00:45:02,866 --> 00:45:05,234
Fuck you.

124
00:45:08,706 --> 00:45:13,776
I don't want to talk about it
anymore. Do you mind if I smoke?

125
00:45:25,489 --> 00:45:28,357
You can keep
that dress if you want to.

126
00:45:28,359 --> 00:45:30,860
I don't want it.

127
00:45:36,767 --> 00:45:39,769
Why do you let her
treat you like that?

128
00:45:47,077 --> 00:45:49,812
'Cause she's my mother.

129
00:45:51,115 --> 00:45:56,085
Now if you don't want
that dress, take it off.

130
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:18,374
Take it off!

131
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:12,474
Who the fuck are you?

132
00:55:12,476 --> 00:55:14,410
Get out of my club.

133
00:55:43,773 --> 00:55:46,542
Can somebody tell me

134
00:55:46,544 --> 00:55:49,478
what the fuck this cunt
is trying to say?

135
00:55:50,513 --> 00:55:52,881
Who put out the hit?

136
00:55:55,919 --> 00:56:00,589
Go fuck yourself.
How about that?

137
00:56:49,806 --> 00:56:53,008
She said you murdered her son.

138
00:56:55,078 --> 00:56:58,680
She wanted you dead.

139
00:58:02,245 --> 00:58:05,214
Fuck you.

140
01:01:41,130 --> 01:01:43,465
You know who he is?

141
01:02:26,242 --> 01:02:29,077
Want to fight?

142
01:08:45,187 --> 01:08:48,156
When I was pregnant with you...

143
01:08:50,159 --> 01:08:53,261
...it was strange.
You were different.

144
01:08:56,599 --> 01:08:59,601
They wanted me to terminate...

145
01:09:01,337 --> 01:09:03,671
...but I wouldn't.

146
01:09:10,746 --> 01:09:13,281
And you're right.

147
01:09:14,383 --> 01:09:17,252
I don't understand you.

148
01:09:27,830 --> 01:09:30,532
And I never will.

149
01:09:37,706 --> 01:09:40,642
What have you done?

150
01:09:42,178 --> 01:09:45,380
I fucked up.

151
01:09:45,382 --> 01:09:48,383
I tried to do right by Billy.

152
01:09:49,652 --> 01:09:52,520
And now I'm going to pay.

153
01:09:55,658 --> 01:09:59,260
He's coming after me next,

154
01:09:59,262 --> 01:10:02,897
and I have no one left
to protect me.

155
01:10:04,433 --> 01:10:08,203
I know after your father I said
I'd never ask you again,

156
01:10:08,205 --> 01:10:10,939
but please, Julian,
just this once.

157
01:10:10,941 --> 01:10:14,776
Take care of this for me.

158
01:10:14,778 --> 01:10:17,879
Don't let them hurt me.

159
01:10:17,881 --> 01:10:21,683
Then we can get out of here.
We can go home.

160
01:10:22,618 --> 01:10:25,853
I can take care of you.

161
01:10:25,855 --> 01:10:28,856
I can be your mother again.

162
01:12:06,689 --> 01:12:09,590
Who's going to do the kid?

163
01:12:11,860 --> 01:12:14,729
We're just here for him.

164
01:12:15,764 --> 01:12:18,633
But that's not what she said.

165
01:12:27,943 --> 01:12:30,645
What did she say?

166
01:12:30,647 --> 01:12:33,815
She said to kill them all.

167
01:13:30,739 --> 01:13:34,008
I came here to
collect my son's body.

168
01:13:34,010 --> 01:13:39,414
Now that it's been released, my
business here in Bangkok is done.

169
01:13:39,416 --> 01:13:43,551
I'm ready to go home.

170
01:13:43,553 --> 01:13:47,622
- When are you leaving?
- I was leaving tonight.

171
01:13:49,725 --> 01:13:53,928
And your other son?
Is he going with you?

172
01:13:53,930 --> 01:13:57,432
What, Julian? Oh...

173
01:13:57,434 --> 01:14:02,470
I haven't had any real contact
with Julian since he left America.

174
01:14:04,606 --> 01:14:07,508
But you were there last night.

175
01:14:12,514 --> 01:14:14,749
Yeah.

176
01:14:16,084 --> 01:14:18,986
He's not much of a fighter.

177
01:14:59,495 --> 01:15:05,700
And it breaks my heart that Billy got
caught up in the scene here because of him.

178
01:15:09,137 --> 01:15:12,874
Billy was my first son.

179
01:15:12,876 --> 01:15:16,777
We had a very
special relationship.

180
01:15:16,779 --> 01:15:21,182
Julian was so jealous. It was
like he was cracked or something.

181
01:15:21,184 --> 01:15:24,886
He had paranoid delusions
about us.

182
01:15:26,088 --> 01:15:29,624
And it pains me
to say this to you,

183
01:15:29,626 --> 01:15:33,594
as it would pain any mother,

184
01:15:33,596 --> 01:15:39,600
but he killed his own father
with his bare hands.

185
01:15:39,602 --> 01:15:43,638
That's why he had
to get out of America.

186
01:15:43,640 --> 01:15:48,009
He's a very dangerous boy.
