1
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:22,560
"In 1972, in New York City..."

2
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,480
"you couldn't go out in the street
at night..."

3
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,120
"and there was a lot of
robbery going on."

4
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,760
"Things were so bad in New York..."

5
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,520
"that people ran away
from all different areas..."

6
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:36,280
"where they were in danger,
and life wasn't so beautiful..."

7
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:39,880
"and the winters were cold,
and the traveling was miserable..."

8
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,000
"and they were ready to retire."

9
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,000
"They ran away.
They ran to Florida."

10
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:46,840
"And this place was a boom."

11
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,520
"Anybody that had a job..."

12
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,680
"and made a living could move
to Kings Point."

13
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,520
"It was safe,
and such a beautiful home."

14
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,360
"If you want to life upstairs,
it was 1,000 dollar more."

15
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,440
"They claimed that the insects
don't go to the second floor."

16
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:03,600
"Upstairs, downstairs?
What's the heck's the difference?"

17
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:07,560
"There were people lined up
with checks in their hand."

18
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:10,160
"Take my money, take my money."

19
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,680
"And so beautiful with bamboo
and various colors..."

20
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,400
"green, blue, yellow, orange."

21
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,280
"We've never seen these colors
in New York."

22
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,880
"My goodness. Here you only
have to put down 1,500 dollar..."

23
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,400
"and you could be a condominium owner
down here in Florida."

24
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,160
Would you...
Could you fall in love again?

25
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:57,120
- No, you can't
- I don't think so. My God.

26
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,120
You're older.
The feelings are different.

27
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:04,920
At 40 or 50, I could see it.
I could understand it more.

28
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,360
But at 70?
No. Definitely not.

29
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,960
It's...

30
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,520
I don't think any of the feelings
are there.

31
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:18,200
Some ladies, they've got to have
a male companion wherever they go.

32
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,000
One croaks, they got another one.

33
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,920
God.
The men, the men.

34
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,560
No, the women...
there's women like that. Yeah.

35
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,800
There are more women than men
that are like that.

36
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:31,240
They go through them like hotcakes.
And then this one dies.

37
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:34,320
They can't be alone, can't be alone
a minute without a guy.

38
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,160
Got to have a guy next to them
because they're desperate.

39
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:40,320
They got to have somebody.

40
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,760
They got to have somebody.

41
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,600
If you're one of these old guys,
they don't take care of you.

42
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,120
They can't. They need somebody
to take care of them.

43
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,920
And then you hear them sitting in...

44
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,400
making noises. I said, "Ugh."

45
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,400
And it's nauseating
when an old crock...

46
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,200
crock of shit touches me...

47
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,080
I'm not into that.

48
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,600
I don't need them.

49
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,680
Them or their sex or their money
or what have you.

50
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,640
I'm taking care of myself
very nicely.

51
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,920
Classic.
This is classic balsamic vinegar.

52
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,200
I don't know. Taste it.
Tell me if it's any different.

53
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:36,080
Wait, I've got to close the cap
because you never close the cap.

54
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,960
- I just opened it for you.
- Is that what you?

55
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,200
- That's right.
- But you've got to close the cap.

56
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:45,240
Bea got me locked up.
In a way, she's got me locked up.

57
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,920
And...

58
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,640
I have not met anybody...

59
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,240
that I really could connect to...

60
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:56,520
that I would really want
to go out with.

61
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,720
So, you know,
I just leave it as it is.

62
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,960
When I first met Frank,
I thought he's a nice guy.

63
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,480
That's about it.
I mean I didn't have any...

64
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,840
romantic thoughts about him.

65
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,720
He's basically good, I think.

66
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:17,960
Until he would cross me.
He'd better run for his life.

67
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,640
You know,
people see you together a lot.

68
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,680
Frank, I would say the same thing.

69
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:26,760
- And people do assume...
- They say, "Oh, yeah."

70
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:30,080
I tell them, "We're just friends."
They say, "Yeah."

71
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,120
They assume.
Why do they want to assume?

72
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,520
That's how people are.

73
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,520
- What?
- Friends.

74
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,240
We're friends.
What's wrong with being friends?

75
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,240
I didn't say anything.

76
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:48,160
Love comes in different forms,
I guess.

77
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,200
Not only...

78
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,560
- going to bed with each other.
- Right.

79
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:56,680
Concern could be deeply concerned
about someone.

80
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:59,840
Could that be love?
I don't know.

81
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,040
You know what love is.

82
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,720
- Or you dont? I dont know.
- Yes.

83
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,000
If I have something to do
on a Friday night...

84
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,280
going out on Saturday night
is enough for me.

85
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:16,160
It's companionship. You know, you got
somebody to do something with...

86
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,080
and it's nice.

87
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,760
- Finish your food.
- Okay, I will.

88
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,160
Kings Point is a place to be
where you're not alone.

89
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,440
You're alone, but you're not alone.
There are people around...

90
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,720
and there's always something to do.

91
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,400
When a widow is a widow...

92
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,760
she's got to look to do things
to keep her busy.

93
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,320
Else she'll die.

94
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,160
New York, New York.

95
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,760
- Do you have enough?
- That's it.

96
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,000
- Bea is going to get mad at me.
- I know. I know it...

97
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,720
but I know it can't be helped.

98
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:22,120
You know, she's going to say,
you know, "Why did you do that?"

99
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,680
She gets ballistic, goes crazy.

100
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:27,280
She's afraid
she's going to lose you.

101
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,800
- She never had me.
- Yeah, well, you know.

102
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:37,400
You know, I mean Jane's a friend.
I'm not looking to date Jane.

103
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:44,840
You know, I mean I know Jane,
how she is. She's emotional.

104
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,920
Right, Jane?
She's a lovely person.

105
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,880
And I don't want to play her
play with her, you know?

106
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,720
And that she wants somebody, right?

107
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,200
Right.

108
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,320
And I'm not the person for her.

109
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,880
I could love this guy.

110
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,800
I know. And she's a loveable person.

111
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:10,000
I could love her too, but...

112
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,800
that's not what I want, you know?

113
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:16,520
I'm looking for long-range, you know?

114
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,120
- You know what I'm thinking about?
- Yes.

115
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,040
- We've got to get out of here.
- Yes.

116
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:27,160
That's my friend Frank,
and that's his girlfriend over there.

117
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,360
And you're going to get hell.

118
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,480
So I know him.

119
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:36,880
- She cooks for him.
- You're kidding.

120
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,480
- Yeah, she does.
- That's all she does?

121
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,080
That's all she does is cook.

122
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,160
I don't believe it.
She must do more.

123
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,960
No. He says,
"No, she cooks."

124
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,120
Okay, let's go.
I'm ready to go.

125
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,320
I guess some people
get their pleasure...

126
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,640
from watching someone eat.

127
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,040
Everybody needs one friend.

128
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,120
We need more than...

129
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,400
No, just one that you can
really talk to...

130
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,920
and be very close with.

131
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,080
The others are
very good acquaintances.

132
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,960
- Where do you find them all?
- You don't.

133
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:24,600
You don't, okay. I just wondered...

134
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,600
When you...

135
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:29,760
When you're younger,
you have made friends.

136
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,640
When you came to Florida,
or wherever you went...

137
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,160
and you moved someplace else,
you made acquaintances...

138
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,680
and good acquaintances.
Not friends friends.

139
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,640
They're just not here anymore.

140
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,080
At this stage,
you're not making friends.

141
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,360
Nobody gets too close here.
They're afraid.

142
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,640
That's how they are here.
Everybody's for themselves...

143
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,400
what they can get out of you
I think I told them that.

144
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,840
What they can get,
anything out of you.

145
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,680
They use...
everybody's a user here.

146
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,240
So you get to become one yourself.

147
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:17,560
Do you remember what made
you want to move down 20 years ago?

148
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,640
Yes, my husband had a heart attack.

149
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:23,800
And he was told, "You cannot take
the winters in New York.

150
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:26,960
If you really want to have
a good quality of life...

151
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,400
get out of New York.
Go to California.

152
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:32,760
Go to Arizona.
Go to Florida."

153
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:37,360
I don't know
how content any of us are.

154
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,240
I think we have all
made our understanding...

155
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,040
we have all made our peace,
and we know what it is.

156
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:47,280
You try to fill your days
as best as you can.

157
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,360
You go to the malls.

158
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:51,280
You go to the Boynton Mall Tuesday,
Thursdays, and Saturdays.

159
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,480
You go to Town Center on Fridays.

160
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:56,800
Sundays, they have movies
at the clubhouse.

161
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:01,920
And there are times you stay home,
and other times you play mahjong...

162
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,560
in other words, you make
the very best of living in Florida.

163
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:38,440
I moved here 13 years ago
because I was afraid...

164
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:41,280
to live in the area.
The neighborhood changed.

165
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:46,040
So I migrated here to Florida.

166
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,800
And I love the weather.

167
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,320
I'm happy here. I like it.

168
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:56,760
And I got to the point where
you don't miss the family so much.

169
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:59,520
You know, you don't miss them.

170
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,800
Would you ever consider moving in
with your kids?

171
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,360
Never.

172
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,360
- Why not?
- I like to visit.

173
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,200
No, I have this health insurance
you know, in case they all have it...

174
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,280
home care.

175
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,280
That's if you get sick,
and you come home...

176
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:16,120
and they have a nurse.
So I spoke to my daughter-in-law...

177
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:19,440
the younger one. She said,
"What do you need it for?"

178
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:24,440
I said, "Hey, by the way,
if I get sick, God forbid...

179
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:27,880
are you going to be there
to take care of me?"

180
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:32,520
She didn't answer. She's very good.
She's very sweet. She's very caring.

181
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:36,680
And she didn't answer.

182
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,160
Knowing what I know today,
I would never move away.

183
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,920
In other words, I would never
move away from my children.

184
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,400
Because basically everyone's
very nice, everyone has friends here.

185
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,480
But children are children.

186
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:14,560
And as you grow older,
you begin to realize it's children...

187
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,640
...plus grandchildren.

188
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,480
And you miss a lot of their...
I miss a lot of their lives.

189
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:29,240
That's my youngest grandson, Spencer.
He's 13-years-old, and David is 16.

190
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:34,680
Now they come here for five days,
four days, a week, maybe ten days.

191
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:37,320
By the end of the time, they're pull
their hair out of their heads...

192
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,600
because there really
is nothing for them to do here.

193
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,800
- Five.
- Right. You've got five points.

194
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,680
Five points instead of three.

195
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,600
- How many cards?
- I have...

196
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:54,880
My husband passed on in 1983.

197
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:57,000
Suddenly.

198
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:01,240
He had the flu, and that was it.

199
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:05,640
And how was life different for you
after that?

200
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:09,000
It sucked.
You going to put that in?

201
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,440
Forget it.

202
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:16,120
And the friends who you're
friends with for 50 years?

203
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,880
- Forget it.
- Why?

204
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:21,200
Because they would go out,
and I would be behind.

205
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,160
Oh my, look at this.

206
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,960
- It's only number one.
- How lucky you are?

207
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,120
- Frank.
- I don't know how to play this game.

208
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,400
Frank, I know how to play.

209
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,480
But if you don't get the cards,
forget it.

210
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:36,640
Hey, when we're playing,
you're not my friend.

211
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,120
Hey, be nice.

212
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,120
You have five, six, seven,
eight of clubs.

213
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,640
- That's a flush.
- Throw a card.

214
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:46,840
You flush the toilet. You don't
flush, you don't have a flush.

215
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,320
See how he talks to me?

216
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,480
- And I'm throwing out the two.
- Don't tell me.

217
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,160
- I like that.
- Hooray!

218
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:57,800
- Hey, look at that. I won a quarter.
- Hey, I'm throwing this...

219
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,840
I'll be right back.

220
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,160
- All right?
- It's okay with me.

221
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,120
Frank.

222
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,520
Hi.

223
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,440
- Hi, Janey.
- Hello. Here we go.

224
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:22,920
It's been a year
since Manny passed away.

225
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,880
And I was thinking about him.

226
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:28,920
So being home alone tonight
I guess my thoughts were...

227
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,840
They weren't good.

228
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,600
- How are you?
- But now I'm okay.

229
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,720
I mean we're playing cards...

230
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:23,280
instead of in there dancing
and drinking, we're playing cards.

231
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,840
Thank you.

232
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,560
Frank. You want to knit?

233
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:33,320
- No.
- You want to knit?

234
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,560
You don't want a lemon drop?

235
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:02,240
When I look around,
it's frightening.

236
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:08,680
There are more singles living here...

237
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:12,440
than there were five years ago,
ten years ago.

238
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,920
And it begins to...
it's not...

239
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,600
It's frighten...
it's not that it's frightening...

240
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,560
because this is
just the way life goes.

241
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,200
But you don't know
what you want to do.

242
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,040
Do you want to stay here?

243
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:25,680
Do you want to go back to New York
to where your children are?

244
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:29,160
And if you do that, it's not
the great, the best thing either.

245
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,360
It's not. They have their own lives.

246
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,080
You have your life.
Your grandchildren have their lives.

247
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:39,440
It's not a very good trade.

248
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:43,640
Staying here is just about
the only thing you can do...

249
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:46,440
because you know people here.
You have a life here.

250
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:49,280
In New York, there's no such life.

251
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,160
And you don't have the time
to make it a new life.

252
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:58,760
Sick people, very sick indeed.
Very sick.

253
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,920
Both of them.

254
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,640
Alzheimer's.

255
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,520
- We're watching the store. Hi.
- Hi.

256
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,960
That's nice. It's an outing.

257
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,520
I once got sick.
They wouldn't come near.

258
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,240
They thought I was contagious.

259
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,040
They...
I was...

260
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,640
I don't know what I had,
but they wouldn't come near.

261
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:24,120
On the phone.
So what do you do?

262
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:27,000
I said, "I'm sick.
I can't go out. That's it."

263
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:29,200
And they were the only one,
the sickest one...

264
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,280
in the whole neighborhood,
she said, "I'm not afraid.

265
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,560
I'm dying anyway."

266
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,680
She had hepatitis.
She said, "I'll do...

267
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,120
what do you want?
I'll go get anything you want."

268
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,440
She came in and everything.

269
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,520
Everybody else wouldn't,
but she came in.

270
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,400
But not them.
I'm telling you.

271
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:48,120
All of them sitting like by the pool.
They're chummy bummies.

272
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,720
Not everyone feels very good.

273
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:55,640
And, not everyone wants to hear
what the next one has to say.

274
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:58,280
In other words, I don't want to know
your complaints.

275
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,640
I have my own.
You know, and nobody means it.

276
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,640
They really don't mean it.

277
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,800
I know I don't mean it.

278
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,880
But it's just a form of...

279
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,360
you just don't want to hear something
that is not very good anymore.

280
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:17,280
Self-preservation is number one.

281
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:21,680
Always. No matter what it is,
at what age. It doesn't matter.

282
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,400
Self-preservation is number one,
always.

283
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,560
That's the store here.

284
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:33,120
Pretty over here, isn't it, our view?

285
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,440
The golf course.

286
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,720
Is anyone from Kings Point
going to visit you here?

287
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,760
Why should they?

288
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:37,160
We're all in the same situation.

289
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,360
Alone.

290
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:50,320
Try to make new friends,
which really is very difficult.

291
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:54,320
Everything will work out.

292
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:19,560
Hello, Harry. Hi, how are you?

293
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:22,240
Yeah.
Where's Gladys? Did she leave?

294
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,240
Tell her to call me back.

295
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:27,320
If she ain't doing anything, the...

296
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:30,600
I'm in the house.
I have nothing to do. Yeah.

297
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:34,560
Maybe she wants to come over.
I don't know.

298
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,280
Okay.

299
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:46,160
You defrost them under the water.

300
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,760
I don't know
whether I would fall in love again.

301
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:02,320
I think I probably would try not to.

302
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:06,280
- Why?
- Because I don't want to get hurt.

303
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,080
Right?

304
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:16,880
I need affection.
I need closeness.

305
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,720
I need you know. I need to be...

306
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:22,080
I need real love.

307
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,960
I don't get that from Bea
because I...

308
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,360
you know, it's not going to work
with her.

309
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:31,280
She's good.
She's... I love Bea.

310
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,000
I love her.

311
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:37,000
But I don't want to get too close
to her...

312
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:41,760
because then, eventually,
I'm going to separate.

313
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,800
Because if I ever meet somebody...

314
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,440
you know, I mean I got to think
about my life.

315
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:54,960
And my life is not going to be
a real life that I want with Bea.

316
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:58,400
Thank you for being the person
that you are...

317
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:02,200
and for being my friend.
You have...

318
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:06,600
You have brightened my life.

319
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,360
What do you think?

320
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:19,920
If Bea were ten years younger...

321
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,280
be my age...

322
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:26,880
I would probably marry...
I would consider marrying her.

323
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:30,000
- So why is the age so important?
- I don't want to...

324
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:35,760
I put one wife...

325
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,160
I buried one wife.
I don't want to bury another one.

326
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,160
All right?

327
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:43,080
That's it.

328
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,720
I want somebody to bury me.

329
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,400
- Look at the nice hats.
- I'm not wearing it. No way.

330
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:04,480
Come on. How are you?
Happy new year to you.

331
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:11,320
Yes. We came here at 7 o'clock.

332
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:14,320
There's new year's eve.
The new year's eve party.

333
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,960
I haven't gone for nine years.

334
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,480
Since we became widows,
we haven't been going.

335
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,760
This keeps us busy.

336
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,200
That is sad.

337
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:40,520
There was a time
when you couldn't even...

338
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:44,840
you couldn't even get a table
for new year's eve. Look at this.

339
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,000
That's sad.

340
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:05,240
Five, four, three, two, one.

341
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:08,280
Happy new year.
