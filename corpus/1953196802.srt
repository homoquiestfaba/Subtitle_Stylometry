00:00:49,783 --> 00:00:54,550
<i>So I'm embarrassed about this,
but I have this giant astrology book.</i>

3
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:59,215
<i>And it says that today,
that my 29th birthday...</i>

4
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:05,126
<i>...Saturn returns to the place of my birth
and it turns my life upside-down.</i>

5
00:01:07,467 --> 00:01:12,302
<i>It says that Saturn is going to bring
all of my shit to the surface...</i>

6
00:01:12,472 --> 00:01:15,168
<i>...and then I'm going to evolve.</i>

7
00:01:15,341 --> 00:01:17,935
<i>I'm paraphrasing, of course.</i>

8
00:01:18,545 --> 00:01:22,003
<i>I know that change is inevitable.</i>

9
00:01:22,182 --> 00:01:25,777
<i>But what if I don't want things to change?</i>

10
00:01:25,952 --> 00:01:29,683
<i>What if I like my life exactly how it is?</i>

11
00:01:51,744 --> 00:01:54,110
Happy birthday.

12
00:01:54,547 --> 00:01:56,378
I feel old.

13
00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:58,983
You're so old.

14
00:02:02,522 --> 00:02:04,615
Do I look 29?

15
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,986
Yeah, you kind of do.

16
00:02:07,427 --> 00:02:09,156
No, I'm only kidding.

17
00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:11,194
You look like the white J. Lo.

18
00:02:11,364 --> 00:02:14,026
Baby, J. Lo is in her 40s.

19
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,294
- No, she's not.
- Yes, she is.

20
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,563
- J. Lo's in her 40s?
- Mm-hm.

21
00:02:20,773 --> 00:02:22,070
What?

22
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:26,271
I got a surprise.

23
00:02:26,779 --> 00:02:28,178
Blow.

24
00:02:29,082 --> 00:02:32,142
- Now you're gonna get it.
- I can't get it. Heh-heh.

25
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:34,684
Now you're gonna get it.

26
00:02:36,956 --> 00:02:38,651
You're gonna get it.

27
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:42,317
Why aren't you ticklish? It's so weird.

28
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:45,495
- All right, if...
- Okay, okay, I got it. I love you.

29
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:49,032
- I love you too, Lola. Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

30
00:02:50,236 --> 00:02:53,728
You look very handsome today!

31
00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:55,866
Don't anybody touch him!

32
00:02:56,042 --> 00:02:58,272
He's mine!

33
00:02:58,444 --> 00:03:01,971
Yes, you can die from
drinking too much water.

34
00:03:02,148 --> 00:03:03,376
Yes.

35
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:05,848
I'll e-mail you the article.

36
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,617
I know, you just have to find a balance. It's...

37
00:03:08,788 --> 00:03:11,382
- Oh, my...!
- Bike lane!

38
00:03:12,091 --> 00:03:14,753
No, Luke's great.

39
00:03:14,928 --> 00:03:19,024
Yeah, he's just been working like crazy
on his solo show.

40
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,895
It's paintings of celebrity sex tapes.

41
00:03:22,068 --> 00:03:24,229
No, Anderson Cooper's not in there.

42
00:03:24,404 --> 00:03:25,530
Should he be?

43
00:03:40,653 --> 00:03:44,248
What...? Are you trying to masturbate?
We just had sex.

44
00:03:47,794 --> 00:03:49,921
- Lola.
- Yes?

45
00:03:56,436 --> 00:03:57,960
Will you marry me?

46
00:04:02,475 --> 00:04:06,002
Do you think there's a magazine
for pregnant brides?

47
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:08,337
Have you died?!

48
00:04:08,514 --> 00:04:10,345
No, I'm ready.

49
00:04:12,385 --> 00:04:13,647
Dude, you look incredible.

50
00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:16,820
- Don't tell Luke you were here.
- Let me video-chat with him.

51
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:19,891
What? You've had literally
the same phone since 11th grade.

52
00:04:20,059 --> 00:04:22,755
Whatever. Chicks love old phones.
They think I listen more.

53
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,829
You trying to take maid of honor from me?

54
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:27,762
<i>I ordered strippers who get naked
to the soundtrack of Glee.</i>

55
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:30,494
- I'm not listening.
- Can your band play Cee Lo?

56
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:33,298
- I'm a rock star.
- Ta-ta.

57
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:37,332
It's a wedding dress! It's a wedding dress!

58
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:39,808
No, no. Gluten-free chocolate.

59
00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:41,310
Ask about the icing.

60
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:45,349
What...? Yeah, oh, Raimundo,
is the icing rice-milk based?

61
00:04:45,518 --> 00:04:47,042
- Non-GMO.
- No rice milk.

62
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,381
Non... Non-GMO.

63
00:04:49,555 --> 00:04:52,183
No, wait... Hold on.
Hold on, Raimundo, yeah.

64
00:04:52,358 --> 00:04:55,521
I got someone on the other line. Hello?

65
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,996
Oh, hi, hi.

66
00:04:59,165 --> 00:05:00,655
Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure.

67
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:02,357
Yeah, it's your mom. Again.

68
00:05:02,535 --> 00:05:05,868
Could you please tell her that
we've been planning this for nine months?

69
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:08,007
- We got it under control.
- Relax, honey.

70
00:05:08,174 --> 00:05:10,802
- I'm fine, I'm fine.
- Hi, Mom.

71
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:14,811
I know, but it's too expensive
if the resort caters it.

72
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:16,005
Okay, I have to go.

73
00:05:16,182 --> 00:05:18,650
- I love you too. Bye.
- Hey, Alice. Nice dress.

74
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:21,286
- It's expensive.
- I'm gonna step outside for a minute.

75
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:22,887
Okay. What's up?

76
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:26,082
Well, I'm the last single woman
in New York City.

77
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:28,523
I went to volunteer at
a womers homeless shelter.

78
00:05:28,695 --> 00:05:30,686
They all had boyfriends.

79
00:05:30,863 --> 00:05:32,262
The homeless.

80
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:34,992
Why don't you date Henry? He's single.

81
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:39,104
I don't know, Henry is sort of hot,
but he's your best friend.

82
00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:40,603
It would be like fucking you.

83
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:44,940
I'm gonna find you a guy if it kills me.

84
00:05:46,212 --> 00:05:49,181
What's your Match. com log-in?
Is it still "Let-me-be-your-hole"?

85
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,044
"Let-me-be-your-hole-1."

86
00:05:51,217 --> 00:05:53,879
It was taken. The first one was taken.

87
00:05:54,053 --> 00:05:56,647
All right, I'm following the dot,
and the dot...

88
00:05:56,823 --> 00:05:58,290
It's moving all over the place.

89
00:05:58,458 --> 00:05:59,755
- Where is it, Len?
- This way.

90
00:05:59,926 --> 00:06:03,384
Dad, it's on the corner, so you don't need
to use your iPhone to get there.

91
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:06,691
Okay. Because the iPad,
wouldn't that get us there faster?

92
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:08,731
- Yeah.
- You are obsessed with this thing.

93
00:06:08,901 --> 00:06:13,065
It's a sickness. Now he plays Scrabble
with strangers online in Milwaukee.

94
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:15,230
I am retired. Let me soar.

95
00:06:15,408 --> 00:06:17,876
I know this building. Do you remember?

96
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:20,274
It was a sex dungeon.

97
00:06:20,446 --> 00:06:22,277
Right. Let me search that.

98
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:28,377
Honey, you're gonna die
when you see these flowers.

99
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:32,948
I feel like I should just quit school
and start planning weddings.

100
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:37,154
Honey, what's up? Did you have a stroke?

101
00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:06,583
Oh, no.

102
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:12,695
What's happened here?

103
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:19,400
It's comfier on the ground?

104
00:07:22,508 --> 00:07:24,476
You want me to get you something, honey?

105
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,713
Chips.

106
00:07:49,535 --> 00:07:52,561
The issue is that 40 guests
have already bought their tickets...

107
00:07:52,738 --> 00:07:55,229
...for a destination wedding in Chiapas.

108
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:58,741
Who's going to pay those people back?
Because it's not going to be Lola.

109
00:07:58,911 --> 00:08:03,848
Not when your heartless, shit-eating son decided
to pull the plug and ruin my daughter's life.

110
00:08:04,016 --> 00:08:07,383
Honey, drink the kombucha tea,
it settles the soul.

111
00:08:07,553 --> 00:08:09,214
Screw the kombucha.

112
00:08:09,388 --> 00:08:12,186
Let me buy you something
with high-fructose corn syrup.

113
00:08:12,358 --> 00:08:14,349
You want some nasty cinnamon buns?

114
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:17,860
I could melt cinnamon buns
and feed them to you intravenously.

115
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:21,124
No, no, I wonder, you know,
when you started to believe...

116
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:24,463
...that the mother of the groom
should be involved...

117
00:08:24,637 --> 00:08:28,698
...because it certainly wasrt early on,
when we were making all the plans.

118
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:34,704
- Thanks.
- Sure.

119
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:39,109
You added a polar bear lamp.

120
00:08:39,285 --> 00:08:41,845
Yeah, I thrifted it.

121
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:45,653
Okay, so, um, I...

122
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:50,421
I know I said I kind of subletted
this apartment to you indefinitely...

123
00:08:50,596 --> 00:08:52,723
...but I'm gonna have
to move back because...

124
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:56,630
It's okay. I know exactly where this is going
and it's actually perfect.

125
00:08:57,236 --> 00:09:00,034
Because my boyfriend just proposed!

126
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:01,764
We're gonna move in together.

127
00:09:02,642 --> 00:09:04,576
Oh, my God.

128
00:09:13,786 --> 00:09:15,754
- He had such a beautiful loft.
- Yeah.

129
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:18,117
- And it's rent-stabilized.
- I know.

130
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:21,223
My world is shattered, and I'm eating.

131
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:22,554
I'm power-eating.

132
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:25,563
- You're eating rice chips.
- That have so much sodium.

133
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:28,723
Hey, if anything,
you need to be freed, you know?

134
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:33,304
From the shackles of a steady relationship...

135
00:09:33,472 --> 00:09:38,102
...with an attractive, successful man
who actually enjoys cooking.

136
00:09:38,277 --> 00:09:40,245
Fuck, this is really depressing.

137
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:43,143
It's just, Luke is my partner in crime.

138
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:47,446
He's the person I want to wake up with
and I want to go to bed with.

139
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:50,885
He's the whole reason I went back to school
to get my PhD.

140
00:09:51,057 --> 00:09:53,958
Now I can't even afford to do that
without splitting the bills.

141
00:09:54,126 --> 00:09:56,219
That is not true. You can still go to school.

142
00:09:56,395 --> 00:09:59,489
Work at your mom's restaurant part-time
like after we graduated.

143
00:09:59,665 --> 00:10:03,032
What are we gonna do about our friends?
How do we split them up?

144
00:10:03,202 --> 00:10:06,433
- I mean, you don't really have that many friends.
- That's true.

145
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:08,435
Except for Henry.

146
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,132
Henry is a mutual friend.

147
00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:13,005
Honestly, Lo, this is good. You know?

148
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:15,010
You met Luke yourjunior year abroad.

149
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:16,546
I mean, you were a baby.

150
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:18,809
You need to be on your own again...

151
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:23,046
...dating other people, letting them stick it in,
knowing what that feels like.

152
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:25,518
You've never been with anyone else.

153
00:10:25,691 --> 00:10:27,158
That's not good for character.

154
00:10:27,326 --> 00:10:28,350
You know? Look at me.

155
00:10:28,527 --> 00:10:30,427
Being single builds character.

156
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:34,125
Ugh. Oh, I'm sore.

157
00:10:34,934 --> 00:10:37,129
<i>- Who is it?
Hey, it's Henry.</i>

158
00:10:38,504 --> 00:10:39,528
Okay, come in.

159
00:10:39,705 --> 00:10:42,697
- I gotta go wash my vagina.
- Why?

160
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:45,070
What, you neverjust washed your vagina?

161
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:53,250
- Hi.
- Hi.

162
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:57,116
This is a consolation lasagna.

163
00:10:57,289 --> 00:10:59,257
Just put it there.

164
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,485
I'm so sorry.

165
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:06,257
I don't know if you
want to see me right now or...

166
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:08,890
I don't know if
I want to see you right now.

167
00:11:09,068 --> 00:11:11,093
You look terrible.

168
00:11:12,204 --> 00:11:14,764
I know it's weird.

169
00:11:16,075 --> 00:11:18,100
You don't have to pick a side.

170
00:11:18,277 --> 00:11:19,767
No, I know I don't have to.

171
00:11:19,945 --> 00:11:22,004
Are you serious? You have to pick a side.

172
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:24,941
You are prettier than him.

173
00:11:25,117 --> 00:11:26,414
And I'm a better person.

174
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:27,978
So you say.

175
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:29,883
She's like Mother Teresa!

176
00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:31,250
Only younger.

177
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:34,885
But not that much younger.

178
00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:39,623
This is number one on Yelp
for best bar in a scary neighborhood.

179
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:42,057
You're gonna love it.

180
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:46,638
- It's crowded.
- I'm dressed for a barbecue.

181
00:11:46,806 --> 00:11:49,400
- Okay, let's get a drink.
- Okay.

182
00:11:52,311 --> 00:11:54,541
<i>If I gave you all my heart
Would you take it?</i>

183
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:56,910
<i>Would you break it?</i>

184
00:11:57,083 --> 00:12:00,644
<i>Would you take it?
Don't matter to me</i>

185
00:12:07,426 --> 00:12:08,518
Hello.

186
00:12:08,694 --> 00:12:10,491
<i>Would you tell me that we're through?</i>

187
00:12:10,663 --> 00:12:12,494
<i>Can't tell me it wasrt true</i>

188
00:12:12,665 --> 00:12:15,327
Excuse me? Bartendress?

189
00:12:16,168 --> 00:12:19,467
<i>Or would you lie to me?</i>

190
00:12:19,638 --> 00:12:21,970
Oh, here she is.

191
00:12:23,843 --> 00:12:25,310
- Good? Good?
- Oh, yeah.

192
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:26,502
- Good?
- Yeah.

193
00:12:29,815 --> 00:12:31,180
What's happening?
- I'm...

194
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:34,683
- Let it out.
- I'm having a panic attack.

195
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:37,015
- Okay, okay. Let's go.
Okay, okay.

196
00:12:37,189 --> 00:12:38,281
Keep going. Excuse us.

197
00:12:38,457 --> 00:12:39,515
It's okay.
Sorry.

198
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:41,159
Bye!

199
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:45,859
Sorry. Excuse us.

200
00:12:46,031 --> 00:12:48,192
- You okay? Do I need to call 911?
- No. No.

201
00:12:48,367 --> 00:12:50,028
Okay, look, breathe, breathe.

202
00:12:50,202 --> 00:12:52,329
It's okay. Everything's okay. Look at me.

203
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:54,564
Slow, slow it down.

204
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,605
Good. It's just a bar, okay?

205
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:57,936
It's just a bar.

206
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:00,237
Everything's fine. I'm right here.

207
00:13:00,412 --> 00:13:01,640
Okay?

208
00:13:02,848 --> 00:13:04,509
Can you get me a cab?

209
00:13:04,683 --> 00:13:07,447
Yeah, yeah. Just wait right here.

210
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,178
Hold on, I see one.

211
00:13:09,355 --> 00:13:10,379
Oh, taxi?

212
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:17,854
Hi. Sorry, can you just wait one second?

213
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:20,999
Hi. Are you at home?

214
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:27,272
Do you have any of that tea
that makes you skinny?

215
00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:32,604
No, but I crushed as many amphetamines
as I could in here, so that should do the trick.

216
00:13:35,614 --> 00:13:36,876
I feel like an idiot.

217
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:39,244
I feel like everyone saw it coming but me.

218
00:13:39,418 --> 00:13:41,886
Nobody saw it. It was like fucking lightning.

219
00:13:42,054 --> 00:13:45,182
- He didn't say anything to you?
- Never.

220
00:13:45,357 --> 00:13:48,053
I mean, all he wanted to do
was have fun when we were out.

221
00:13:48,227 --> 00:13:53,028
I mean, sometimes he'd pretend like he wasrt
in a relationship, but that's what guys do.

222
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:55,690
It doesn't necessarily mean anything.

223
00:13:55,868 --> 00:13:57,392
Did he cheat on me or...?

224
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:59,197
No.

225
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:01,802
Hey, he would never.

226
00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:06,301
I feel like men are always looking
for someone better...

227
00:14:06,478 --> 00:14:08,946
...and women are just looking
for whatever works.

228
00:14:09,114 --> 00:14:10,445
Well, I don't feel like that.

229
00:14:10,616 --> 00:14:13,676
I just want to meet someone
I can hang out with all the time...

230
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:16,617
...eat bologna with, read shit to me.

231
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:20,281
- I had that person.
- Hey.

232
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:25,724
Do you remember that time when we did
mushrooms at your parents' country house?

233
00:14:25,898 --> 00:14:26,956
Yeah.

234
00:14:27,132 --> 00:14:29,726
And you made us go into
that swamp full of nasty shit...

235
00:14:29,902 --> 00:14:32,370
...because you thought
we owed it to the plant life?

236
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:35,336
- The plants needed us.
- Right. And then you were convinced...

237
00:14:35,507 --> 00:14:38,442
...that we wouldn't get out of there,
and I calmed you down...

238
00:14:38,611 --> 00:14:41,603
...by singing that slow version
of "Girls Just Want to Have Fun. "

239
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,304
We went back in the house and...

240
00:14:43,482 --> 00:14:46,974
Do you remember this story that
I'm telling you again in great detail?

241
00:14:47,152 --> 00:14:50,918
Yeah, it's the best worst night ever.

242
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:54,616
- What's your point?
- I get you out of swamps.

243
00:15:13,646 --> 00:15:16,911
<i>Hey, it's me again.</i>

244
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:18,845
<i>It doesn't have to be like this, Lo.</i>

245
00:15:19,018 --> 00:15:24,388
<i>We could still talk
and be in each other's lives, you know?</i>

246
00:15:25,991 --> 00:15:27,788
<i>Hey, it's me again.</i>

247
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,825
<i>You're killing me here.</i>

248
00:15:29,995 --> 00:15:32,225
<i>At least let me know you're okay.</i>

249
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:34,593
<i>All your stuff is here.</i>

250
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:37,834
<i>Call me, please.</i>

251
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:43,966
I haven't changed my underwear
in three days.

252
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:49,581
Listen, Mom, do you think you could go over
to his place and just pick up my stuff?

253
00:15:50,749 --> 00:15:53,718
I can't do it. I just...

254
00:15:54,386 --> 00:15:58,880
Yeah, just bring it back to my old apartment.
Yeah, use the key that I gave you.

255
00:15:59,058 --> 00:16:01,993
Oh, thank you, Mom.

256
00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:03,992
I love you too.

257
00:16:04,163 --> 00:16:07,394
Okay, I'm gonna go elliptical. Bye.

258
00:16:28,921 --> 00:16:30,548
Yeah, I'll be right there.

259
00:16:42,801 --> 00:16:44,769
You go wild?

260
00:16:45,237 --> 00:16:46,829
What?

261
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:50,874
- The salmon, did you buy wild?
- Oh.

262
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:54,278
No, it seems pretty tame to me.

263
00:16:54,813 --> 00:16:57,373
I know there are more important things
to worry about...

264
00:16:57,549 --> 00:17:01,076
...but when you buy fish,
you should try to pay attention to that.

265
00:17:01,253 --> 00:17:03,949
Gotta honor your body, you know?
I'm Nick.

266
00:17:04,123 --> 00:17:05,283
- Hi. Lola.
- Hi.

267
00:17:05,457 --> 00:17:08,119
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

268
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:10,085
Bye.

269
00:17:12,297 --> 00:17:13,958
Anything from Nova Scotia?

270
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:23,441
Do you shop here a lot?

271
00:17:26,412 --> 00:17:27,879
I can't be picked up right now.

272
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:32,006
I appreciate the interest,
but I'm in a really bad place.

273
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:33,942
Gotcha.

274
00:17:36,655 --> 00:17:38,885
I would love to cook you dinner sometime.

275
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,958
Something fresh-caught.

276
00:17:41,126 --> 00:17:43,151
Well, not... Not by me.

277
00:17:43,328 --> 00:17:44,488
Fresh-bought.

278
00:17:44,663 --> 00:17:48,997
Oh, I don't really like fish.
I'm just eating this because it's salty.

279
00:17:50,969 --> 00:17:54,632
You know, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna give you my number.

280
00:17:56,008 --> 00:17:58,238
You may use it, you may not.

281
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:03,641
If you do...

282
00:18:05,184 --> 00:18:07,243
...I'm free...

283
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:09,353
...a week from Friday.

284
00:18:09,521 --> 00:18:11,352
After 7.

285
00:18:12,224 --> 00:18:14,454
But I could do 6:30.

286
00:18:28,474 --> 00:18:32,604
Okay, Leo. "It's time to fasten
your seat belt, kitty cat. Don't hiss at me.

287
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:37,078
With Uranus, the planet of
lightning-bolt surprises...

288
00:18:37,249 --> 00:18:39,877
...you really never know which way is up.

289
00:18:40,052 --> 00:18:42,486
This is going to be a shitty month. "

290
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:45,215
He said,
"This is going to be a shitty month"?

291
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:47,551
<i>It's the Voice. They write what they know.</i>

292
00:18:48,494 --> 00:18:52,624
- You know, your mom and I broke up once.
- You did?

293
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:55,665
Yeah, we decided to date other people.

294
00:18:55,834 --> 00:18:59,133
Seemed like a fun idea, but then we realized
that nobody else really compared.

295
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:01,033
Heh. Uh...

296
00:19:01,373 --> 00:19:04,934
- Do you think that'll happen to me and Luke?
- No. No, I don't. I hate Luke.

297
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:08,568
I de-friended him on Facebook already.
He's out.

298
00:19:09,715 --> 00:19:11,342
Thanks.

299
00:20:15,847 --> 00:20:19,112
Okay, love, fuck or kill?

300
00:20:19,284 --> 00:20:23,084
Heh, heh. Hilary Duff, Haylie Duff...

301
00:20:23,255 --> 00:20:25,849
...or any of the Fannings.

302
00:20:26,858 --> 00:20:28,883
You realize they're not related, right?

303
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:30,392
I'm pretty sure they are.

304
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:33,690
Wait, I think it's "marry, fuck, kill. "

305
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:38,366
What's...? How...? How is it different?

306
00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:44,265
Because I think the assumption is if you...
After you're married, that you don't fuck.

307
00:20:44,443 --> 00:20:46,104
- Right.
- Yeah.

308
00:20:46,278 --> 00:20:48,974
- I guess I dodged a bullet, then.
- Pfft.

309
00:20:50,015 --> 00:20:51,107
That was...

310
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,899
Ooh.

311
00:21:23,548 --> 00:21:25,106
Wake up.

312
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:30,310
Oh, shit.

313
00:21:32,357 --> 00:21:33,847
You want breakfast?

314
00:21:34,026 --> 00:21:36,460
No. I have to go.

315
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:40,460
Here, help me. I have no core.

316
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:01,178
- Hey.
- Hey.

317
00:22:01,353 --> 00:22:06,086
I'm sorry to surprise you like this,
but you didn't call me back.

318
00:22:06,258 --> 00:22:07,987
Can I talk to you for a sec?

319
00:22:08,794 --> 00:22:12,753
I'm really late for this meeting.
I don't think I can right now.

320
00:22:12,931 --> 00:22:16,924
Yeah, but, look, wait, wait...
Please, just wait a second?

321
00:22:18,236 --> 00:22:19,362
What's that green thing?

322
00:22:20,572 --> 00:22:23,166
Oh. I'm cleansing.

323
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:25,533
I drink it out of this thing.

324
00:22:26,144 --> 00:22:27,236
The potion.

325
00:22:27,412 --> 00:22:29,846
- Does it work?
- Yeah, it does.

326
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:31,277
That's good.

327
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:34,544
So I'm... I've been...

328
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:37,513
...you know, thinking about things and...

329
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:42,092
I don't know,
I might have acted irrationally.

330
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:44,353
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

331
00:22:45,464 --> 00:22:47,989
I'm... I'm confused.

332
00:22:49,267 --> 00:22:51,167
Are you seriously doing this right now...

333
00:22:51,336 --> 00:22:54,772
...right before I have to go in
and argue about my dissertation?

334
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:57,773
Shit. I'm sorry. I didn't know.
You didn't return my calls.

335
00:22:57,943 --> 00:23:00,173
I've been really busy.

336
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:04,306
Look, I...

337
00:23:04,816 --> 00:23:07,250
I know this came out of nowhere...

338
00:23:07,419 --> 00:23:12,857
...and I think I was just overwhelmed
by everything that was happening and...

339
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:14,883
And now I just...

340
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:17,995
Are you just doing this
because you're lonely?

341
00:23:18,497 --> 00:23:20,089
No.

342
00:23:20,265 --> 00:23:23,325
I just really wanted to see you.

343
00:23:24,369 --> 00:23:26,462
I really...

344
00:23:26,638 --> 00:23:28,299
...have to go.

345
00:23:29,841 --> 00:23:31,240
Wait.

346
00:23:56,568 --> 00:24:01,505
Essentially, I'll be investigating the use
of silence in 19th-century French literature.

347
00:24:01,673 --> 00:24:04,540
- Are you still using the poetry of Mallarmé?
Yes.

348
00:24:04,709 --> 00:24:08,839
I want to really look at his obsession
with the blank page...

349
00:24:09,014 --> 00:24:13,713
...really exploring the ways in which
his verses engender silence.

350
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:19,815
I would also like to look at silence
in the media and popular culture.

351
00:24:19,991 --> 00:24:22,789
Well, more of the lack thereof.

352
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:25,725
Just our communal...

353
00:24:25,897 --> 00:24:30,231
...almost deathly fear of silence.

354
00:24:38,343 --> 00:24:40,470
I don't know what I want.

355
00:24:42,414 --> 00:24:46,009
- Should I give you guys some more time?
- We'll be ready in a minute.

356
00:24:46,184 --> 00:24:48,118
Just stand there.

357
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,511
Um...

358
00:24:51,223 --> 00:24:52,383
I'll have the...

359
00:24:52,557 --> 00:24:56,584
...gnocchi and a glass of the "sangreesha. "

360
00:24:57,362 --> 00:25:00,525
Do you mean sangria?

361
00:25:00,699 --> 00:25:02,098
I'm... We don't have that.

362
00:25:02,267 --> 00:25:04,201
- Do you have wine?
- Yes.

363
00:25:04,369 --> 00:25:06,303
Put fruit cocktail in it.

364
00:25:06,471 --> 00:25:09,235
- Go.
- I'll get that for you.

365
00:25:16,081 --> 00:25:19,107
Can you put fruit cocktail
in a glass of wine for me?

366
00:25:20,552 --> 00:25:23,885
- Hey, Randy. How's the bar stock?
- Pretty empty, like my bank account.

367
00:25:24,055 --> 00:25:25,249
- Hey.
- Hi, Mom.

368
00:25:25,423 --> 00:25:27,948
How are you doing, sweetie? You okay?

369
00:25:28,126 --> 00:25:30,424
- I'm choosing to be alive.
- Well, good.

370
00:25:30,595 --> 00:25:34,429
Listen, I have something really important
to talk to you about, all right?

371
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:36,794
- Okay.
- Okay, not here. Let's...

372
00:25:37,335 --> 00:25:41,829
I was thinking about this in the taxi yesterday
when I was watching that little TV set.

373
00:25:42,007 --> 00:25:43,406
Right.

374
00:25:43,909 --> 00:25:46,469
- It's about freezing.
- Freezing?

375
00:25:46,645 --> 00:25:49,409
Think you might want to think about
freezing the eggs.

376
00:25:49,581 --> 00:25:50,912
The eggs?

377
00:25:51,082 --> 00:25:54,176
- My eggs?
- Yes, those eggs.

378
00:25:54,352 --> 00:25:55,649
Oh, come on, Mom.

379
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:58,414
I am not gonna have children anytime soon.

380
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:01,559
Well, exactly my point. You will.

381
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:05,127
They do it in a great facility. Trust me.
My friend Debbie did it.

382
00:26:05,297 --> 00:26:07,060
She has eggs all over the city.

383
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:09,132
Six happy children.

384
00:26:09,301 --> 00:26:12,065
Well, one of them's a giant, but very nice.

385
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:14,967
That's so depressing.
I am already depressed.

386
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:18,371
- Could you let me grieve, please?
- Grieve, grieve. We're all grieving.

387
00:26:18,543 --> 00:26:21,103
But I'm just trying to think practically
on your behalf.

388
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:23,440
You're not getting any younger.
They shrivel.

389
00:26:23,615 --> 00:26:25,913
Could we just talk about something else?

390
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,488
I don't fucking know.

391
00:26:38,163 --> 00:26:40,825
Sangreesha, house specialty.

392
00:26:55,714 --> 00:26:58,945
<i>You wanna hear
You broke my heart</i>

393
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:00,584
<i>You broke my heart</i>

394
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:06,582
<i>I wanna hear
You're gonna finish what you start</i>

395
00:27:08,259 --> 00:27:09,851
<i>You wanna put</i>

396
00:27:10,061 --> 00:27:12,655
Hell really is bright.

397
00:27:13,164 --> 00:27:15,655
I always forget that Times Square exists.

398
00:27:15,834 --> 00:27:17,529
Yeah, it does.

399
00:27:17,702 --> 00:27:19,329
For all time, it's been here.

400
00:27:19,504 --> 00:27:21,563
All these lights make me nauseous.

401
00:27:44,129 --> 00:27:46,723
I...

402
00:27:46,898 --> 00:27:48,559
I...

403
00:27:48,733 --> 00:27:51,930
- Hi.
- Hi!

404
00:28:06,051 --> 00:28:08,417
Remember when I had a beard
like that in college?

405
00:28:08,586 --> 00:28:09,678
It was awful.

406
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:11,378
I looked hot.

407
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:15,591
Poor Alice, she just keeps getting cast
as these peasants.

408
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,228
Was that sign language
she was doing part of the play?

409
00:28:18,396 --> 00:28:20,728
- Or was she translating for someone?
- I don't know.

410
00:28:20,899 --> 00:28:22,867
No, she did this dream therapy workshop...

411
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:28,870
...where she said her and her character melded
in a past life as a deaf-mute.

412
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:32,203
Ah. She looked great.
And what was up with the lead guy, Roger?

413
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:34,538
- It was like he was half asleep.
- I don't know.

414
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:37,375
He was terrible.
I don't know why she's obsessed with him.

415
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:38,573
- She's obsessed?
- Yeah.

416
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:40,513
Why? She could do way better.

417
00:28:43,822 --> 00:28:46,120
Congratulations.
Yay! I loved it.

418
00:28:46,291 --> 00:28:48,384
- Thank you.
- Oh, I had an off night.

419
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,188
You were great too.

420
00:28:51,362 --> 00:28:54,820
I accidentally took a Xanax before this show.
I thought it was an Advil.

421
00:28:54,999 --> 00:28:57,263
That's insane. You're insane.
You're so talented.

422
00:28:57,435 --> 00:29:00,029
I couldn't tell at all.
- I basically directed myself.

423
00:29:00,205 --> 00:29:01,365
- Yeah.
- Director's a hack.

424
00:29:01,539 --> 00:29:05,134
Some Yale grad, whatever.
I'm actually adapting this for the screen.

425
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:07,278
I got so much inside and it just...

426
00:29:07,445 --> 00:29:10,778
You know, I'm so...
I'm fucking talented, you know?

427
00:29:10,949 --> 00:29:12,143
I know it inside.

428
00:29:12,317 --> 00:29:15,912
So okay, tell me, was I okay?
Did you see me? Did I find my light?

429
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:19,579
You were so believable. Heh.

430
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:21,020
Why are you laughing?

431
00:29:21,192 --> 00:29:24,184
Was I too much? Was it over the top?
Because I can bring it down.

432
00:29:24,362 --> 00:29:27,388
I can make it, you know,
less viewpointy, more Congo.

433
00:29:27,565 --> 00:29:28,759
What does that even mean?

434
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:32,759
The whole thing is a metaphor
for genital mutilation.

435
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:36,798
- Did you not get that?
- Oh...

436
00:29:39,377 --> 00:29:43,814
- Do you want me to carry your thermos?
- Oh, yeah. That would be awesome.

437
00:29:48,419 --> 00:29:51,252
So this is weird, I'm sorry...

438
00:29:51,422 --> 00:29:55,483
...but do you think that you could
stay over with me tonight?

439
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:58,424
Nights are really hard.

440
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:00,493
Uh...

441
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,224
Sure.

442
00:30:03,401 --> 00:30:04,891
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

443
00:30:05,069 --> 00:30:06,969
Thanks. I know it's weird. I just...

444
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:10,107
- No, no, no. Totally, totally, totally.
- I appreciate it. Okay.

445
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:14,301
Why are you waving at me?

446
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:16,037
Waving good night.

447
00:30:17,248 --> 00:30:19,648
Don't sleep on the couch.

448
00:30:21,052 --> 00:30:22,383
What's your thread count?

449
00:30:22,554 --> 00:30:25,216
Like... two.

450
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:27,089
Cool.

451
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:32,493
<i>Just a-being in your service</i>

452
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:37,397
- Ha-ha-ha.
- It's the tapered leg on the... Ahem.

453
00:30:37,569 --> 00:30:39,867
<i>They evince the troubled, nimble wit</i>

454
00:30:40,038 --> 00:30:42,529
<i>Oh, nothing in return</i>

455
00:30:42,707 --> 00:30:45,198
<i>But storm and pessimism</i>

456
00:30:45,376 --> 00:30:47,003
Oh.

457
00:30:48,246 --> 00:30:50,214
<i>Being good for me</i>

458
00:30:50,381 --> 00:30:56,047
<i>And just a-standing in your pretty prison</i>

459
00:30:56,221 --> 00:30:59,122
- Thanks for staying over.
- Yeah, of course.

460
00:31:03,261 --> 00:31:06,697
Oh, God, Luke would kill me
if he knew I was in your bed.

461
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:11,529
I'm pretty sure that Luke
no longer has jurisdiction over these parts.

462
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:13,899
Yeah, that's true.

463
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:20,601
<i>Being good for me</i>

464
00:31:20,778 --> 00:31:25,613
<i>And just a-standing in your pretty prison</i>

465
00:31:25,783 --> 00:31:29,219
<i>You're standing here</i>

466
00:31:33,791 --> 00:31:40,287
<i>You think you love me</i>

467
00:31:41,432 --> 00:31:44,663
<i>Don't you?</i>

468
00:31:48,973 --> 00:31:51,840
<i>Maybe you're the presence</i>

469
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:55,707
<i>That begs needing other reasons</i>

470
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:59,441
<i>I got "Summer still looks pretty"</i>

471
00:31:59,617 --> 00:32:03,747
<i>I got hungry for the hungry seas</i>

472
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:06,447
Stop. We can't do this.

473
00:32:07,191 --> 00:32:08,749
Yes, we can. It's fine.

474
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:10,622
No, Luke's a good friend.

475
00:32:10,795 --> 00:32:12,626
Yeah, but you're my best friend.

476
00:32:12,797 --> 00:32:14,389
I'm a rebound.

477
00:32:14,565 --> 00:32:16,590
No, you're more of a layup.

478
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:18,861
Oh, I feel like I'm breaking code.

479
00:32:19,037 --> 00:32:23,440
I don't know what the rules are
in this situation.

480
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:26,509
We can make up the rules.
We don't have to have sex.

481
00:32:26,678 --> 00:32:27,940
I don't...

482
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:31,206
Well, you know I've always
had feelings for you.

483
00:32:31,816 --> 00:32:34,182
No, I didn't know that.

484
00:32:37,021 --> 00:32:39,854
Yeah, so I think we should...

485
00:32:40,024 --> 00:32:44,961
We should just be careful, you know,
and take it slow.

486
00:32:45,163 --> 00:32:48,326
- Okay.
- Okay.

487
00:32:49,334 --> 00:32:51,529
- Good night.
- Good night.

488
00:33:41,586 --> 00:33:42,917
Luke.

489
00:33:43,087 --> 00:33:44,952
Yeah, it's me.

490
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:50,486
I really miss you.

491
00:33:51,929 --> 00:33:53,920
Can I see you?

492
00:33:58,836 --> 00:34:00,463
I feel like I'm gonna puke.

493
00:34:00,972 --> 00:34:03,668
- What am I doing? I don't know what I'm doing.
- Okay, look.

494
00:34:03,841 --> 00:34:05,706
Here, open your mouth.

495
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:08,004
Ugh! What? What's that?

496
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:09,271
- Weed in a bottle.
- What?

497
00:34:09,447 --> 00:34:12,041
Freshens the breath
and gets you fucked up, dude.

498
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:16,414
I got it in Koreatown last time I was in L.A.
Smuggled it in my cooch pouch on the plane.

499
00:34:16,587 --> 00:34:19,556
- I am going to kill you!
- Here. Relax!

500
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:21,749
God! Put this weed candy
under your tongue.

501
00:34:21,926 --> 00:34:24,019
- Stop it! You need help.
- You don't want this?

502
00:34:24,195 --> 00:34:25,787
- No.
- Are you sure?

503
00:34:25,963 --> 00:34:27,487
- Yes.
- Okay.

504
00:34:27,665 --> 00:34:30,793
- What exactly is the point of this meeting?
- I need closure.

505
00:34:30,968 --> 00:34:33,869
I don't know. I don't know what I need.
I'm hot. Is it hot out?

506
00:34:34,038 --> 00:34:37,337
- Feel like I'm gonna be sick. It smells like sulfur.
- Lola:

507
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:44,177
What does that last part mean?

508
00:34:44,348 --> 00:34:47,511
"You don't have a wife yet,
but you named your son Somalingam. "

509
00:34:47,685 --> 00:34:49,812
- Ancient Indian proverb.
- What?

510
00:34:49,987 --> 00:34:52,922
Find your spirit animal
and ride it till its dick falls off.

511
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:54,115
- All right?
- Right.

512
00:34:54,292 --> 00:34:55,316
- All right.
- Okay.

513
00:34:55,493 --> 00:34:56,551
- Go get him.
- I'm going.

514
00:34:56,727 --> 00:34:58,024
- I got your back.
- I love it.

515
00:34:58,196 --> 00:35:00,027
I love you.

516
00:35:01,466 --> 00:35:02,763
All right.

517
00:35:06,404 --> 00:35:09,373
How's the dissertation coming?

518
00:35:09,574 --> 00:35:12,543
Slowly. The silence is killing me.

519
00:35:14,212 --> 00:35:15,679
How's the painting?

520
00:35:15,847 --> 00:35:17,508
It's really good.

521
00:35:17,682 --> 00:35:20,014
I've been getting a lot of work done and...

522
00:35:20,318 --> 00:35:21,945
Wow.

523
00:35:23,354 --> 00:35:24,548
Are you okay?

524
00:35:24,722 --> 00:35:26,553
Yeah, I'm fine.

525
00:35:30,394 --> 00:35:31,418
<i>What?</i>

526
00:35:34,899 --> 00:35:36,833
Think I'm gonna...

527
00:35:46,878 --> 00:35:51,315
I'm just trying to figure out
what I'm eating or...

528
00:35:58,122 --> 00:36:00,420
How long did you know?

529
00:36:00,591 --> 00:36:01,922
Know what?

530
00:36:02,093 --> 00:36:04,061
That you were gonna leave me.

531
00:36:05,129 --> 00:36:07,188
I mean, honestly?

532
00:36:07,632 --> 00:36:09,429
Not long.

533
00:36:10,034 --> 00:36:14,164
I mean, I think it was when
the whole wedding started to feel real.

534
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:18,240
You know, with your family
and the flowers and the plane tickets.

535
00:36:18,409 --> 00:36:19,899
And suddenly I was just...

536
00:36:20,077 --> 00:36:23,672
- Dude, were you just pretending to love me?
- No.

537
00:36:24,482 --> 00:36:26,279
Of course not.

538
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:28,941
So, what are we doing?

539
00:36:31,055 --> 00:36:32,852
I don't know.

540
00:37:17,268 --> 00:37:18,929
Hey.

541
00:37:19,103 --> 00:37:21,071
Please, don't cry.

542
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:25,000
I don't think I can see you anymore.

543
00:37:27,878 --> 00:37:29,368
Why?

544
00:37:31,515 --> 00:37:35,007
It's too painful.

545
00:37:37,188 --> 00:37:41,147
But if we're both missing each other,
I don't see why...

546
00:37:41,325 --> 00:37:43,520
I just can't.

547
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,748
- Hey.
- What the heck happened to you?

548
00:39:11,916 --> 00:39:14,544
<i>You went AWOL for three hours.
I thought he killed you...</i>

549
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:17,017
<i>...and disappeared to the Catskills.
- We had sex.</i>

550
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:21,284
<i>Yeah, I saw a 20/20 like that.
In fact, girl who's supposed to be married...</i>

551
00:39:21,459 --> 00:39:24,087
<i>...head found severed near
a Jewish community center.</i>

552
00:39:24,261 --> 00:39:25,558
Are you listening to me?

553
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:27,960
I said we had sex.

554
00:39:28,132 --> 00:39:29,258
<i>Yes, I'm listening.</i>

555
00:39:29,433 --> 00:39:31,333
Wait, what did you say?

556
00:39:34,071 --> 00:39:37,598
It's like he's good for me,
but he's bad for me.

557
00:39:37,775 --> 00:39:39,242
- Yeah.
- You know?

558
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:42,675
The guy who's supposed to make me
feel safe is actually dangerous...

559
00:39:42,847 --> 00:39:45,111
...which just makes me
want to have sex with him.

560
00:39:45,282 --> 00:39:47,944
I'm drunk. I love macrobiotic food.

561
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:50,019
Who puts your sentences together?

562
00:39:50,187 --> 00:39:52,246
Honestly, your brain is like a bad DJ.

563
00:39:52,423 --> 00:39:56,860
- It was terrible. I had to see him.
- Yeah. Well, hey, at least you got options.

564
00:39:57,027 --> 00:40:01,020
Me, I can't find someone to love me
momentarily during orgasm...

565
00:40:01,198 --> 00:40:04,292
...which is really an easy moment
to love someone fleetingly, no?

566
00:40:05,102 --> 00:40:07,366
- What happened?
- Roger wouldn't have sex with me.

567
00:40:07,538 --> 00:40:09,301
- Oh, boy.
- Like I was some refugee.

568
00:40:09,473 --> 00:40:13,409
Then I went and got drunk by myself,
unless a bottle of Kahlúa counts as a partner...

569
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:16,444
...then went back
and hate-fucked him two times.

570
00:40:16,614 --> 00:40:18,241
Yeah. I don't know, I don't know.

571
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:20,748
Maybe you're right,
maybe I should just date Henry.

572
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:23,045
Oh, God. Um...

573
00:40:24,121 --> 00:40:26,749
- We made out.
- What?

574
00:40:27,391 --> 00:40:30,519
Ba-ba-ba. Back up the train.
Why didn't you tell me?

575
00:40:30,694 --> 00:40:33,162
- Because I didn't want you to judge me.
- Judge you?

576
00:40:33,764 --> 00:40:37,291
I don't know, I think I like him?

577
00:40:37,468 --> 00:40:39,060
Okay. Wow, okay.

578
00:40:39,236 --> 00:40:42,228
Should I slit my wrists now
orjust wait till after the meal?

579
00:40:42,406 --> 00:40:46,137
Oh, stop it. You are going to find someone
just the second you stop looking.

580
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:50,478
- Have you been on Match. com lately?
- Seriously, now.

581
00:40:51,182 --> 00:40:54,345
What am I eating? This is just gas in a box.

582
00:40:54,518 --> 00:40:56,076

583
00:40:56,253 --> 00:41:01,213
I'm sorry, I didn't realize that we would be
tracing the New York City Marathon route.

584
00:41:01,659 --> 00:41:04,059
- We're here.
- Where?

585
00:41:04,228 --> 00:41:06,526
Neil Sedaka's house.

586
00:41:06,997 --> 00:41:08,862
Never wondered where Neil Sedaka lives?

587
00:41:09,033 --> 00:41:12,127
No. Should I be expecting a lot
of Neil Sedaka covers at your show?

588
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:13,497
How weird does it sound...

589
00:41:13,671 --> 00:41:16,538
...to say "Neil Sedaka" this many times?
- Neil Sedaka, Neil Sedaka, Neil Sedaka.

- What happened to you?
- I spray-tanned. What happened to you?

608
00:42:34,351 --> 00:42:37,650
I don't see you for two weeks,
and now you're ethnically ambiguous.

609
00:42:37,821 --> 00:42:39,379
It's a conversation starter.

00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:01,080
Now? A site-specific bathroom dance party?

684
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:03,692
- No, like I gotta get out of here.
- Oh, yeah.

685
00:46:03,861 --> 00:46:05,795
- Okay?
- Yeah, let's go.

686
00:46:07,297 --> 00:46:09,128
Listen, I'm sorry, I know it's shitty...

687
00:46:09,299 --> 00:46:10,630
Did you fuck her?

688
00:46:10,801 --> 00:46:13,167
No, I swear.

689
00:46:13,337 --> 00:46:15,168
Hey. That was so great.
- Hey.

690
00:46:17,207 --> 00:46:20,005
Your new boyfriend and me
had a little chitchat.

691
00:46:20,177 --> 00:46:21,201
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

692
00:46:21,378 --> 00:46:23,778
- Was it fun?
- Great.

693
00:46:23,947 --> 00:46:26,472
I mean, out of all people.

694
00:46:26,650 --> 00:46:27,912
I mean, really.

695
00:46:28,085 --> 00:46:30,178
Dude, it's not like it was planned.

696
00:46:30,354 --> 00:46:31,616
You sure about that?

697
00:46:32,189 --> 00:46:35,852
- Well, it's not as planned as your wedding.
- Hey, fuck you!

698
00:46:36,026 --> 00:46:37,857
I have food poisoning.

699
00:46:38,028 --> 00:46:40,588
I gotta load out, so...

700
00:46:40,764 --> 00:46:43,062
- I'll call you tomorrow.
- I won't.

701
00:46:43,233 --> 00:46:46,202
Touché. We're going.

702
00:47:02,219 --> 00:47:05,017
<i>I'm gonna get my bathing suit on
Gonna get my base face on</i>

703
00:47:05,189 --> 00:47:07,817
<i>Gonna get my hat out of loan
Gonna get my space face on</i>

704
00:47:07,991 --> 00:47:10,789
<i>I'm gonna turn all snakes into bone
Go wishing the stone</i>

705
00:47:10,961 --> 00:47:13,589
<i>Keep the crystal cat cold
Gotta get to the throne</i>

706
00:47:13,764 --> 00:47:16,164
<i>Hope my baby
May we meet a beastman</i>

707
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:18,893
<i>Hold us there
Happy but by one hand</i>

708
00:47:19,069 --> 00:47:21,037
<i>Gonna get my pile of stone</i>

709
00:47:30,347 --> 00:47:31,371
<i>Hello?</i>

710
00:47:31,548 --> 00:47:34,608
It's Lola! It's me! Let me in, please!

711
00:47:34,785 --> 00:47:36,912
<i>It's 4 in the morning.</i>

712
00:47:44,561 --> 00:47:47,189
Dude, stop. You're really drunk.

713
00:47:52,436 --> 00:47:53,903
- Oh, are you close?
- Yeah.

714
00:47:54,071 --> 00:47:56,301
- Yeah?
- Yeah, yeah.

715
00:48:07,150 --> 00:48:10,244
- Yeah? Oh. Mm.
- Yeah. Yeah.

716
00:48:23,934 --> 00:48:27,631
So, what do you sound like
when you really come?

717
00:48:38,515 --> 00:48:40,483
I don't know.

718
00:48:40,651 --> 00:48:45,179
I guess I'm... quieter.

719
00:48:49,459 --> 00:48:51,586
When you told Luke
that I was your boyfriend...

720
00:48:51,762 --> 00:48:54,697
...did you say that
just to make him mad or...?

721
00:48:56,600 --> 00:49:00,969
I don't know. I'm so messed up right now.

722
00:49:02,639 --> 00:49:03,833
Hey.

723
00:49:06,476 --> 00:49:08,501
You're not messing anything up.

724
00:49:08,679 --> 00:49:10,647
You know, we don't have to label anything.

725
00:49:10,814 --> 00:49:14,215
We can just be.

726
00:49:20,557 --> 00:49:25,153
You know, in the '70s,
folks like you were with a lot of people.

727
00:49:25,329 --> 00:49:26,523
Made sense.

728
00:49:26,697 --> 00:49:28,858
Yeah, they had a lot of STDs.

729
00:49:29,032 --> 00:49:35,062
Well, hey, remember, it's not perfect fidelity,
it's high fidelity.

730
00:49:35,238 --> 00:49:38,401
Dad, what kind of
bumper-sticker crap is that?

731
00:49:38,575 --> 00:49:40,702
That's not crap, that's wisdom.

732
00:49:40,877 --> 00:49:43,311
There is a fine line.

733
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:45,539
Thank you, sage father.

734
00:49:45,716 --> 00:49:49,117
Look, you know, I know that having
your mom and I as parents...

735
00:49:49,286 --> 00:49:51,550
...has kind of made you into
a stressed-out kid...

736
00:49:51,722 --> 00:49:55,488
...but you put a lot of pressure on yourself
to live out a life...

737
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:59,026
...that maybe is a little more conventional
than what you were raised in.

738
00:49:59,196 --> 00:50:03,326
Sometimes it's good, you know,
to just shake life up a little bit.

739
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:05,058
Let it fall out of your hands.

740
00:50:05,702 --> 00:50:06,896
You'll catch it.

741
00:50:07,070 --> 00:50:08,094
Mm-hm.

742
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:18,438
You have such a musical voice.
Do you play any instruments or...?

743
00:50:18,615 --> 00:50:21,209
No, actually. I, um...

744
00:50:22,986 --> 00:50:25,181
Do you play any instruments?

745
00:50:25,355 --> 00:50:27,915
No. I'm much more visual.

746
00:50:28,091 --> 00:50:30,389
Yeah. Anyway, you asked me a question.

747
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:37,159
No, I didn't want to be a prison architect.

748
00:50:37,334 --> 00:50:39,063
That just kind of happened.

749
00:50:39,236 --> 00:50:41,568
Mm. That's awesome.

750
00:50:42,205 --> 00:50:44,673
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

751
00:50:45,442 --> 00:50:46,466
Lola.

752
00:50:48,745 --> 00:50:51,441
You're a writer. What do you...

753
00:50:52,549 --> 00:50:53,914
...want to write about?

754
00:50:54,518 --> 00:50:55,985
Cats.

755
00:50:56,153 --> 00:50:59,145
- Cats.
- Like, the history of cats.

756
00:50:59,322 --> 00:51:01,756
There's something...

757
00:51:02,325 --> 00:51:05,886
...wonderfully feline about you.

758
00:51:06,063 --> 00:51:08,429
Meow. Ha-ha-ha.

759
00:51:10,167 --> 00:51:12,362
No, I was kidding.

760
00:51:12,536 --> 00:51:15,300
I thought, because
I loved literature so much...

761
00:51:15,472 --> 00:51:18,873
...that I'd want to write novels,
but I realized I didn't.

762
00:51:19,042 --> 00:51:21,602
I just want to write about them.

763
00:51:22,746 --> 00:51:23,872
So...

764
00:51:24,381 --> 00:51:26,679
It's very, very sexy.

765
00:51:31,121 --> 00:51:33,351
Can I pour you another glass of wine?

766
00:51:34,191 --> 00:51:35,351
- Okay.
- Yeah?

767
00:51:35,525 --> 00:51:38,016
- Yeah.
- Great.

768
00:51:39,463 --> 00:51:43,024
<i>Do you want to stick with the red?
We could do some sake.</i>

769
00:51:57,447 --> 00:52:00,143
Oh, I really like your knees.

770
00:52:00,317 --> 00:52:02,012
No, wait.

771
00:52:04,321 --> 00:52:07,154
Yeah, I really like your knees.

772
00:52:07,324 --> 00:52:09,087
Thanks.

773
00:52:10,127 --> 00:52:13,062
- You want me to put on some music?
- Okay.

774
00:52:24,975 --> 00:52:26,374
Oh, my God!

775
00:52:26,543 --> 00:52:28,568
I'm sorry. It just came out.

776
00:52:28,745 --> 00:52:31,145
That's okay. I know.

777
00:52:31,314 --> 00:52:32,713
It's freakishly big.

778
00:52:32,883 --> 00:52:36,876
- I can't stop looking.
- I was an incubator baby.

779
00:52:37,821 --> 00:52:41,382
- What?
- I was an incubator baby.

780
00:52:41,558 --> 00:52:42,889
Oh...

781
00:52:43,093 --> 00:52:45,186
What is that?

782
00:52:45,362 --> 00:52:50,265
The incubator, it made my penis bigger
than the other kids'.

783
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:52,631
Oh, yeah.

784
00:52:52,802 --> 00:52:56,238
<i>To see how long our swan song can last</i>

785
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:58,467
Oh, okay.

786
00:52:59,176 --> 00:53:00,939
Ooh. Whoa.

787
00:53:01,211 --> 00:53:03,145
That just slipped in there, huh?

788
00:53:06,449 --> 00:53:10,783
You feel so good.

789
00:53:11,254 --> 00:53:14,246
Just a minute. Shh. Be perfectly still.

790
00:53:14,424 --> 00:53:17,621
Is this...? Is this Ani DiFranco?

791
00:53:18,261 --> 00:53:21,230
Yeah. She's my favorite lyricist.

792
00:53:21,398 --> 00:53:22,797
Oh.

793
00:53:24,067 --> 00:53:27,400
<i>And I am watching your chest
Rise and fall</i>

794
00:53:27,571 --> 00:53:30,335
<i>Like the tides of my life</i>

795
00:53:30,507 --> 00:53:31,531
Could you...?

796
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:34,700
<i>Your bones have been my bed frame
Your flesh has been my pillow</i>

797
00:53:34,878 --> 00:53:36,846
Do you think you could get a condom?

798
00:53:37,013 --> 00:53:38,378
Arert you on the pill?

799
00:53:38,548 --> 00:53:40,778
It doesn't matter.

800
00:53:40,984 --> 00:53:42,576
What are you worried about?

801
00:53:42,752 --> 00:53:45,118
I don't know if you're clean.

802
00:53:45,288 --> 00:53:46,915
I am.

803
00:53:47,591 --> 00:53:49,582
I just got tested.

804
00:53:51,228 --> 00:53:52,889
Scout's honor.

805
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:54,724
Oh, okay, that's...

806
00:53:54,898 --> 00:53:58,595
That makes me feel better. The Boy Scouts.

807
00:53:58,768 --> 00:54:01,396
- Actually, I'm an Eagle.
- Oh.

808
00:54:05,242 --> 00:54:07,210
<i>And when we leave the landlord will come</i>

809
00:54:07,377 --> 00:54:09,743
<i>And paint over it all
And I am walking</i>

810
00:54:09,913 --> 00:54:11,710
<i>Out in the rain</i>

811
00:54:15,952 --> 00:54:18,443
Sure you don't want to get some breakfast?

812
00:54:18,888 --> 00:54:20,549
Omelet?

813
00:54:21,191 --> 00:54:23,853
I can be a few minutes late for class.

814
00:54:24,027 --> 00:54:26,427
You know, that's okay. Thanks.

815
00:54:28,999 --> 00:54:30,694
I had a really nice time last night.

816
00:54:31,468 --> 00:54:34,369
Yeah. Yeah.

817
00:54:35,572 --> 00:54:37,130
Let me roll you home.

818
00:54:37,707 --> 00:54:39,334
- Come on.
- Okay.

819
00:54:44,347 --> 00:54:45,439
Mm.

820
00:54:45,649 --> 00:54:47,344
Sweet architecture.

821
00:54:47,517 --> 00:54:50,111
It's really tight brickwork. Bravo.

822
00:54:52,055 --> 00:54:53,647
Hey.

823
00:54:57,961 --> 00:54:59,258
Henry.

824
00:55:00,063 --> 00:55:03,226
Hi. I'm Nick.

825
00:55:08,772 --> 00:55:09,932
All right.

826
00:55:10,106 --> 00:55:12,165
I better get to Pilates.

827
00:55:12,709 --> 00:55:16,509
Oh, can you give me a hand,
help me with this?

828
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:19,708
Just really tight.

829
00:55:21,351 --> 00:55:24,980
Yeah, just really...
Like, really, really tight. Yeah.

830
00:55:26,356 --> 00:55:27,721
Yeah, okay. Great.

831
00:55:27,891 --> 00:55:29,518
Thank you.

832
00:55:30,093 --> 00:55:31,958
I'll call you later.

833
00:55:35,732 --> 00:55:37,700
Have a blessed day.

834
00:55:40,837 --> 00:55:42,634
What the fuck?

835
00:55:44,374 --> 00:55:46,205
What are you doing here?

836
00:55:46,376 --> 00:55:48,867
I came to surprise you with breakfast.

837
00:55:49,479 --> 00:55:51,879
- These are really nice scones.
- Oh, shit.

838
00:55:52,048 --> 00:55:55,711
Did you just have sex with that Rollerblader?

839
00:55:55,885 --> 00:55:57,477
Um...

840
00:55:58,488 --> 00:56:00,046
Oh, my God.

841
00:56:00,223 --> 00:56:01,554
I cannot believe you.

842
00:56:01,725 --> 00:56:04,751
I'm so sorry. It was terrible.

843
00:56:04,928 --> 00:56:09,297
If it's any consolation,
his dick was so big it hurt my back.

844
00:56:09,466 --> 00:56:11,832
Oh, he has a bigger dick than me too?

845
00:56:12,001 --> 00:56:13,195
No, that is a consolation.

846
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:15,600
You should go into
the greeting card business.

847
00:56:15,772 --> 00:56:18,536
"Sorry I cheated on you.
PS, your dick is smaller. "

848
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:23,042
- No, no, that's not... That's not what I meant.
- I just assumed that we were...

849
00:56:23,213 --> 00:56:24,805
- Yes, yes, yes, we are.
- Yeah?

850
00:56:24,981 --> 00:56:27,245
- I'm confused.
- Yeah, clearly.

851
00:56:27,417 --> 00:56:30,978
I'm vulnerable. I'm not myself.
I'm easily persuaded.

852
00:56:31,154 --> 00:56:34,248
What, so now you're saying
that I persuaded you to be with me?

853
00:56:34,424 --> 00:56:37,393
No. If anything,
I persuaded you to be with me.

854
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:39,824
- Whatever.
- Wait. No, no. Henry, wait, wait, wait.

855
00:56:39,996 --> 00:56:43,488
I didn't know that we were exclusive,
and I didn't know.

856
00:56:43,666 --> 00:56:46,829
I didn't know if it was okay
if I slept with someone else.

857
00:56:47,003 --> 00:56:50,803
Do you know what? It doesn't have
to be articulated. It's just common courtesy.

858
00:56:54,744 --> 00:56:57,076
- Uh...
- Henry!

859
00:56:57,247 --> 00:57:00,011
Please, can we talk about this?

860
00:57:02,919 --> 00:57:06,878
I'm slutty, but I am a good person.

861
00:57:11,394 --> 00:57:16,696
<i>Oh honey, I really miss you</i>

862
00:57:18,401 --> 00:57:19,800
<i>Oh, honey</i>

863
00:57:21,171 --> 00:57:24,800
<i>Though it was only yesterday you kissed me</i>

864
00:57:25,542 --> 00:57:26,907
<i>And that kiss</i>

865
00:57:28,378 --> 00:57:32,371
<i>That kiss was so, so true</i>

866
00:57:33,216 --> 00:57:35,980
<i>I guess I should know better</i>

867
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:40,653
- Hey.
- Hey, I was in the neighborhood.

868
00:57:40,824 --> 00:57:42,553
Oh, that's cool.

869
00:57:43,159 --> 00:57:44,524
Do you have any weed?

870
00:57:44,694 --> 00:57:46,958
<i>When it comes to falling</i>

871
00:57:47,363 --> 00:57:52,562
<i>Oh, honey, I really miss you</i>

872
00:57:53,803 --> 00:57:55,828
One, two, three.

873
00:57:57,474 --> 00:58:01,035
<i>If only you could hold me now</i>

874
00:58:01,878 --> 00:58:03,539
<i>Because you hold</i>

875
00:58:04,747 --> 00:58:08,774
<i>You hold me, oh, so well</i>

876
00:58:09,519 --> 00:58:12,420
<i>I guess I should know better</i>

877
00:58:13,156 --> 00:58:15,886
<i>When it comes to falling</i>

878
00:58:16,793 --> 00:58:19,387
<i>Yes, I should know better</i>

879
00:58:20,430 --> 00:58:25,925
<i>When it comes to falling in love again</i>

880
00:58:28,271 --> 00:58:30,535
I'm glad that you're staying here
when we're gone.

881
00:58:30,707 --> 00:58:34,040
It's good for you to get away
from all the noise out there.

882
00:58:34,210 --> 00:58:37,111
Fuck that noise!
- We'll be back in two weeks.

883
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:40,613
Hey, why don't you throw a rave party?
Go wild.

884
00:58:40,783 --> 00:58:44,947
I can't throw a party. I'll just be thinking about
whether or not to invite Luke or Henry.

885
00:58:45,121 --> 00:58:47,715
Then if I don't invite them,
I'll just wish that I did.

886
00:58:47,891 --> 00:58:50,086
Honey, I really think
you're overanalyzing this.

887
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:53,752
Then if I do invite them and they don't
show up, is it because they hate me?

888
00:58:53,930 --> 00:58:58,697
I just keep having sex
with the wrong people at the wrong time...

889
00:58:58,868 --> 00:59:00,995
...or the right people at the wrong time.

890
00:59:01,170 --> 00:59:03,536
Right time, wrong people!

891
00:59:03,740 --> 00:59:06,106
I should probably try
to be friends with them.

892
00:59:06,276 --> 00:59:08,540
I don't know. I can't tell.
I've never had an ex.

893
00:59:08,711 --> 00:59:11,202
Are you supposed to be friends
with your exes?

894
00:59:11,381 --> 00:59:12,871
Well, honey, sure.

895
00:59:13,049 --> 00:59:16,815
I mean, you know,
show Luke that you've moved on.

896
00:59:16,986 --> 00:59:19,978
Show Henry how you're sorry.
Be the bigger person.

897
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:23,017
Oh, honey, we love you.

898
00:59:23,192 --> 00:59:24,284
A lot of people do.

899
00:59:24,460 --> 00:59:28,863
Unfortunately, you and Dad
do not count as a lot of people.

900
00:59:35,705 --> 00:59:37,696
Randy, I need you to help me with this.

901
00:59:37,874 --> 00:59:40,434
Are you kidding me?
That thing is like a walking toilet.

902
00:59:40,610 --> 00:59:42,475
- Please?
- Clearblue?

903
00:59:42,645 --> 00:59:45,205
- More like clear yellow.
- Tell me whether it's negative.

904
00:59:45,381 --> 00:59:48,441
I let a man I met at a fish store
do me without a condom.

905
00:59:48,618 --> 00:59:49,710
Okay, show me.

906
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:52,454
Show me! Don't touch me.

907
00:59:53,189 --> 00:59:54,281
It's negative.

908
00:59:54,791 --> 00:59:59,819
I don't know why I do this to myself. It's like
I'm constantly attracted to men who punish me.

909
01:00:00,563 --> 01:00:02,929
Maybe because you need to be punished.

910
01:00:22,018 --> 01:00:25,476
Okay, listen, there's at least
four baby daddies here for you...

911
01:00:25,655 --> 01:00:28,556
...and I just texted three more.
One is a serious krumper.

912
01:00:28,725 --> 01:00:31,592
Yeah, let's just set up a gang bang
and see who sticks.

913
01:00:31,761 --> 01:00:34,252
And Ted, the one from
my cervical cancer commercial...

914
01:00:34,430 --> 01:00:36,557
...on his way, just turned 40, totally mature.

915
01:00:36,733 --> 01:00:39,099
- I don't want old sperm.
- Sperm's too old. Got it.

916
01:00:39,268 --> 01:00:42,260
Oh, God. This guy, Nick,
won't stop texting me.

917
01:00:42,438 --> 01:00:43,769
- Monster Dick Nick?
- Yeah.

918
01:00:43,940 --> 01:00:47,501
We slept together, like, weeks ago,
and now he thinks we're dating.

919
01:00:47,677 --> 01:00:49,008
Yucko.

920
01:00:49,178 --> 01:00:51,544
You want any wine?
I have a sweet Zinfandel.

921
01:00:51,714 --> 01:00:54,182
Yeah, yes, Zinfandel.

922
01:00:54,651 --> 01:00:57,347
- What are you doing?
- Baby-wiping my whole body.

923
01:00:57,520 --> 01:01:01,388
Hey, remember you told me
how there's that brain chemical...

924
01:01:01,557 --> 01:01:03,548
...that releases when a woman orgasms?

925
01:01:03,726 --> 01:01:05,318
Oxytocin.

926
01:01:05,495 --> 01:01:08,020
I found it. In a pill.

927
01:01:08,197 --> 01:01:10,062
- What?
- Yeah, my friend was telling me...

928
01:01:10,233 --> 01:01:13,896
...he's been taking it recreationally or whatever,
which I thought was weird...

929
01:01:14,070 --> 01:01:17,801
...because generally dudes can just get off
by looking at their own reflection.

930
01:01:17,974 --> 01:01:21,432
Who's resentful?
But, anyway, I took it tonight.

931
01:01:22,445 --> 01:01:26,074
No. Alice, there is no pill form of oxytocin.

932
01:01:26,249 --> 01:01:28,683
- What you took was OxyContin.
- Yeah, same thing.

933
01:01:28,851 --> 01:01:31,046
No, different thing. Drug-addict thing.

934
01:01:31,220 --> 01:01:34,553
It's like heroin.
It's a really powerful narcotic.

935
01:01:34,724 --> 01:01:36,214
I have been feeling nauseous...

936
01:01:36,392 --> 01:01:40,351
...but often that's the precursor to my orgasms,
so I was just sort of going with it.

937
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:44,261
Luke and Henry just walked in.
Quick, get me a hot guy to talk to.

938
01:01:44,434 --> 01:01:45,924
What? You invited them?

939
01:01:46,102 --> 01:01:48,866
Oh, damn, Henry. You look tasty.

940
01:01:49,038 --> 01:01:51,734
Yeah, this was my party to normalize things.

941
01:01:51,908 --> 01:01:53,273
Are my boobs even?

942
01:01:53,443 --> 01:01:55,911
You think I'm the drug addict. Eh.

943
01:01:56,079 --> 01:01:58,240
See you on the other side.

944
01:01:58,815 --> 01:02:00,009
Oh.

945
01:02:00,950 --> 01:02:02,349
Alice?

946
01:02:04,087 --> 01:02:05,452
Whoo!

947
01:02:11,260 --> 01:02:13,091
Hey. I'm so glad you came.

948
01:02:13,262 --> 01:02:14,661
It's cool.

949
01:02:15,298 --> 01:02:18,233
- Are you still mad at me?
- No.

950
01:02:20,703 --> 01:02:22,728
I'm really sorry.

951
01:02:23,039 --> 01:02:24,802
It's all good.

952
01:02:25,374 --> 01:02:28,275
I hope things aren't weird
with you and Luke.

953
01:02:28,611 --> 01:02:31,808
No. I called him.
We sorted it all out. Yeah.

954
01:02:31,981 --> 01:02:33,505
Awesome.

955
01:02:37,587 --> 01:02:39,316
- Oh, I got... I'm gonna be back.
- Yeah.

956
01:02:39,489 --> 01:02:41,047
Just one sec.

957
01:02:53,836 --> 01:02:58,170
You see, I learned everything
I know about being a woman...

958
01:02:58,341 --> 01:03:00,536
<i>...from 90210.</i>

959
01:03:00,710 --> 01:03:03,975
That explains a lot.

960
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:06,880
In every woman... Henry.

961
01:03:07,049 --> 01:03:08,949
In every woman...

962
01:03:09,752 --> 01:03:13,085
...there's a Brenda...
- Mm-hm.

963
01:03:13,256 --> 01:03:16,589
...Kelly, my personal favorite...

964
01:03:17,026 --> 01:03:21,224
...a Donna, hopefully minus
the gaping boob-hole...

965
01:03:21,397 --> 01:03:22,887
...and an Andrea.

966
01:03:23,065 --> 01:03:27,024
See, every woman is all of those women.

967
01:03:27,203 --> 01:03:28,295
See?

968
01:03:28,471 --> 01:03:31,440
Well, what about Emily Valentine?

969
01:03:41,651 --> 01:03:44,313
Well, he really sounds like a nice guy.

970
01:03:44,854 --> 01:03:48,415
We've only been out twice,
but he is definitely courting me.

971
01:03:49,058 --> 01:03:51,856
He designs prisons.

972
01:03:52,028 --> 01:03:54,428
- I don't like him.
- Neither do I.

973
01:03:54,597 --> 01:03:57,725
- Well, get rid of him.
- I gotta take what I can get.

974
01:03:57,900 --> 01:04:01,461
Come on. You're Lola.
You can get whoever you want.

975
01:04:04,907 --> 01:04:07,899
- So you and Henry are talking again.
- Yeah.

976
01:04:08,578 --> 01:04:09,977
I mean...

977
01:04:10,146 --> 01:04:12,114
I mean, that was stupid.

978
01:04:12,281 --> 01:04:13,839
I get it.

979
01:04:14,016 --> 01:04:15,574
- Cool.
- Yeah.

980
01:04:15,751 --> 01:04:18,219
I mean, he's been really cool
these last few weeks.

981
01:04:18,387 --> 01:04:22,380
We've been hanging out.
It's been like old times.

982
01:04:22,558 --> 01:04:26,551
But, you know, his place, it sucks.

983
01:04:26,762 --> 01:04:29,560
- And my place, it's huge.
- So?

984
01:04:29,732 --> 01:04:34,396
I was thinking, you know,
he might move in with me.

985
01:04:34,570 --> 01:04:37,869
Or he is. He's moving in with me.

986
01:04:44,447 --> 01:04:45,505
What?

987
01:04:46,449 --> 01:04:49,111
I'm sorry. Is that...? Is that totally weird?

988
01:04:49,285 --> 01:04:50,980
- No.
- Good.

989
01:04:51,153 --> 01:04:54,589
Sounds like a super-fun party house.

990
01:04:55,191 --> 01:04:56,886
<i>Like Real World: Miami.</i>

991
01:04:59,929 --> 01:05:01,419
I'm gonna have some people over.

992
01:05:01,597 --> 01:05:04,327
We're having some people over...

993
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:06,991
...and, I mean, I'd love for you to come.

994
01:05:08,704 --> 01:05:10,433
I'll be there.

995
01:05:10,606 --> 01:05:12,130
Great.

996
01:05:18,981 --> 01:05:20,573
<i>I never wanted this for you.</i>

997
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:23,913
I work my whole life, I don't apologize,
to take care of my family.

998
01:05:24,787 --> 01:05:26,652
And I refused to be a fool...

999
01:05:26,822 --> 01:05:29,347
...dancing on the string
held by all those big shots.

1000
01:05:29,525 --> 01:05:34,963
But I thought that, when it was your turn,
that you would be the one to hold the strings.

1001
01:05:35,131 --> 01:05:38,362
Well, it wasrt enough time.

1002
01:05:38,868 --> 01:05:44,807
But, that being said,
I pledge on the souls of my grandchildren...

1003
01:05:44,974 --> 01:05:51,106
...that I will not be the one to break the peace
we have made here today.

1004
01:05:54,050 --> 01:05:57,019
Did you just break up with me
as the Godfather?

1005
01:06:00,156 --> 01:06:01,885
You know what we should do sometime?

1006
01:06:02,058 --> 01:06:05,357
We should get a nice bottle of red
and just do the trilogy.

1007
01:06:05,528 --> 01:06:09,396
<i>Lola! It's not even the best Godfather.
That's... Pfft!</i>

1008
01:06:09,999 --> 01:06:11,330
Ahh.

1009
01:06:11,567 --> 01:06:16,163
What is it you'd like to accomplish today
in your hypnotic trance?

1010
01:06:16,339 --> 01:06:19,137
I'd just like to find quiet.

1011
01:06:19,308 --> 01:06:21,037
My mind is, like, on crazy overdrive.

1012
01:06:21,210 --> 01:06:24,611
I'm constantly obsessing about everything.
Food, boys.

1013
01:06:24,780 --> 01:06:28,739
I need to concentrate,
I need to be writing, I can't do it.

1014
01:06:29,185 --> 01:06:32,985
Yeah, I just...
I'm unable to be in the moment.

1015
01:06:33,322 --> 01:06:35,654
Then that's exactly what we'll work on.

1016
01:06:35,825 --> 01:06:37,520
Close your eyes.

1017
01:06:40,763 --> 01:06:42,856
Oh, my God. I'm s...

1018
01:06:43,065 --> 01:06:44,999
I'm just turning it off. It's just...

1019
01:06:46,869 --> 01:06:48,803
Right now. One second.

1020
01:06:48,971 --> 01:06:52,907
Okay. It's off. Okay.

1021
01:06:53,576 --> 01:06:55,305
Hey, Alice, it's me.

1022
01:06:55,478 --> 01:06:58,709
Listen, I'm really nervous
about going to Luke's party.

1023
01:06:58,881 --> 01:07:02,146
I feel like we're gonna be
the only single people there.

1024
01:07:02,318 --> 01:07:04,286
Do you think I should get a perm?

1025
01:07:04,453 --> 01:07:07,217
Also not sure if I should
wear something see-through.

1026
01:07:07,390 --> 01:07:08,414
Call me.

1027
01:07:10,126 --> 01:07:12,560
I feel like I haven't seen you in ages.

1028
01:07:12,728 --> 01:07:14,889
I don't know. I've been around.

1029
01:07:15,064 --> 01:07:18,500
Well, I called you twice last week
and you didn't call me back.

1030
01:07:18,667 --> 01:07:20,157
Really?

1031
01:07:20,603 --> 01:07:21,797
You know what? Um...

1032
01:07:21,971 --> 01:07:25,998
One of those nights, I think
I was at a concert, maybe, with Hen.

1033
01:07:26,175 --> 01:07:29,167
And then the other one...

1034
01:07:29,845 --> 01:07:33,804
I can't remember. My back is so sweaty.
This party's gonna suck. Let's just not go.

1035
01:07:33,983 --> 01:07:38,113
No, I can do this. I just saw both of them.
The only difference now is I'm seeing them...

1036
01:07:38,287 --> 01:07:41,188
...in the apartment that I thought
I'd raise my children in.

1037
01:07:41,891 --> 01:07:44,860
Yeah, you're right.
When you put it that way, it does sound fun.

1038
01:07:47,830 --> 01:07:49,730
I don't know if I can be here right now.

1039
01:07:49,899 --> 01:07:54,393
Does it make me look poor if I don't
eat the white outside part on the Brie?

1040
01:07:54,804 --> 01:07:56,101
What's up, Alice?

1041
01:07:56,272 --> 01:07:57,864
Oh, hey, what's up?

1042
01:07:58,040 --> 01:08:00,008
Where's Henry?

1043
01:08:00,176 --> 01:08:02,337
- He's over there.
- Oh, okay.

1044
01:08:02,511 --> 01:08:04,638
I'm gonna go say hi.

1045
01:08:07,883 --> 01:08:10,215
- You like the cheese?
- Yep.

1046
01:08:10,386 --> 01:08:12,217
So does your shirt.

1047
01:08:12,388 --> 01:08:15,824
Mm. Yeah, I'm eating for two.

1048
01:08:16,592 --> 01:08:17,923
What?

1049
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:20,294
Oh, no. No, me and my shirt.

1050
01:08:20,463 --> 01:08:23,455
I'm eating for my shirt and me.
Sorry, that was such a dumb joke.

1051
01:08:23,632 --> 01:08:27,159
- I think I just peed a little, yeah.
- I'm totally not pregnant at all.

1052
01:08:28,704 --> 01:08:30,001
How are you and...?

1053
01:08:31,740 --> 01:08:33,605
- Who?
- Leggy.

1054
01:08:33,776 --> 01:08:35,368
Her name is Peggy.

1055
01:08:35,544 --> 01:08:38,206
I know what her name is.
You seem really happy.

1056
01:08:38,948 --> 01:08:40,643
Hey, hey, let's go.

1057
01:08:40,816 --> 01:08:42,113
I think my TiVo's broken...

1058
01:08:42,284 --> 01:08:46,744
...and I have a very important episode
on the History Channel.

1059
01:08:46,922 --> 01:08:49,823
<i>History of Witches. Do you...?</i>

1060
01:08:49,992 --> 01:08:53,018
Oh, and Peggy says
she needs help with the ice, so...

1061
01:08:53,195 --> 01:08:55,322
Oh, right. You know,
she loves you, by the way.

1062
01:08:55,498 --> 01:08:56,658
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

1063
01:08:56,832 --> 01:09:00,893
She loves you? How can she love you
after meeting you one time in a club?

1064
01:09:02,004 --> 01:09:05,701
So have you guys been talking?

1065
01:09:05,875 --> 01:09:07,740
Yeah, we're talking. That's what people do.

1066
01:09:07,910 --> 01:09:10,378
<i>Um, anyway...
Oh, I was watching Chelsea Lately-</i>

1067
01:09:10,546 --> 01:09:12,514
- Talking about what?
Oh.

1068
01:09:12,681 --> 01:09:15,241
It's nothing. It's nothing important,

1069
01:09:15,417 --> 01:09:18,079
Honestly, don't worry about it.
We're not doing this here.

1070
01:09:18,254 --> 01:09:20,017
- Yes, we are.
- No, we're not.

1071
01:09:20,189 --> 01:09:21,918
- Yes, we are.
- What is going on?

1072
01:09:24,627 --> 01:09:25,992
Uh...

1073
01:09:26,295 --> 01:09:31,096
Okay. Lo, we need to talk.

1074
01:09:32,201 --> 01:09:33,998
- No.
It's nothing.

1075
01:09:34,170 --> 01:09:37,139
I mean, it's something,
but it hasn't become anything.

1076
01:09:37,306 --> 01:09:39,672
I mean, without me telling you first.

1077
01:09:39,842 --> 01:09:42,936
- Fuck, I'm an asshole. Shit, let me start over.
- No!

1078
01:09:43,112 --> 01:09:44,272
No, no, no, Lola.

1079
01:09:44,446 --> 01:09:46,311
- Listen to me. Not here, okay?
No!

1080
01:09:46,482 --> 01:09:50,543
You could have just talked to me about it!
Then I wouldn't have been ambushed like this!

1081
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:53,051
- I didn't go after this. It was an accident.
- No!

1082
01:09:53,222 --> 01:09:56,282
All you had to do was tell me you had feelings.
We could've talked!

1083
01:09:56,458 --> 01:09:57,823
- Whoa, guys.
- Shut up!

1084
01:09:57,993 --> 01:09:59,984
When do I ever have time to tell you things?

1085
01:10:00,162 --> 01:10:03,427
- You're wrapped up in your own shit.
Like I don't listen to your shit.

1086
01:10:03,599 --> 01:10:07,535
- All that shit with that actor Roger?
- At least I'm aware I'm not alone in this world.

1087
01:10:07,703 --> 01:10:10,069
I am alone in this world.
You've all left me alone.

1088
01:10:10,239 --> 01:10:11,297
I never left you, okay?

1089
01:10:11,473 --> 01:10:13,941
I've been beside you
every step of this process.

1090
01:10:14,109 --> 01:10:16,577
- The one time I step in front of you...
- I left you.

1091
01:10:17,379 --> 01:10:19,279
They didn't leave you. I left you.

1092
01:10:19,748 --> 01:10:21,773
And Alice and I, we make each other calm.

1093
01:10:21,951 --> 01:10:25,910
Calm, calm. If you were any more calm,
you would be dead.

1094
01:10:26,088 --> 01:10:27,749
Just work on you, okay, Lola?

1095
01:10:39,868 --> 01:10:41,267
Hey. Hey, lady.

1096
01:10:41,437 --> 01:10:43,098
Lady, there's only $2 here.

1097
01:10:43,272 --> 01:10:46,332
Hello. You want to go to jail, lady?
There's only $2 here! I'm talking to you!

1098
01:10:47,876 --> 01:10:50,344
Are you insane? You better get back here.

1099
01:10:51,380 --> 01:10:53,280
Mmm.

1100
01:11:08,397 --> 01:11:10,228
Mm.

1101
01:11:10,766 --> 01:11:15,931
Yeah, ladies! Mm. Mm.

1102
01:11:16,105 --> 01:11:17,595
Work the pole.

1103
01:11:17,773 --> 01:11:21,334
You know, Jessie Spano
was such a good girl, you know?

1104
01:11:21,510 --> 01:11:24,035
It's like why did she do it?

1105
01:11:24,213 --> 01:11:28,013
Like, the caffeine pills...

1106
01:11:28,183 --> 01:11:29,707
Get off the stage, bitch!

1107
01:11:29,885 --> 01:11:33,412
I don't want to go with you.
I like these people. They're my friends.

1108
01:11:33,589 --> 01:11:34,613
No.

1109
01:11:34,790 --> 01:11:36,121
Okay.

1110
01:11:36,292 --> 01:11:38,692
I'm down. I'm all the way down.

1111
01:11:38,861 --> 01:11:42,228
Get her out of here.
- I want to go back.

1112
01:11:46,969 --> 01:11:49,130
Oh, God.

1113
01:12:29,345 --> 01:12:32,212
<i>I wish I could say that
this was someone else's fault.</i>

1114
01:12:35,718 --> 01:12:37,709
<i>That it was Luke's fault.</i>

1115
01:12:40,189 --> 01:12:44,148
<i>Or Henry's fault, or Alice's.</i>

1116
01:12:46,095 --> 01:12:48,029
<i>But it's not.</i>

1117
01:12:49,031 --> 01:12:50,794
<i>It's me.</i>

1118
01:13:08,016 --> 01:13:10,849
Release your emotions.

1119
01:13:12,721 --> 01:13:15,815
Feel the healing power of the platza.

1120
01:13:15,991 --> 01:13:17,549
Relax.

1121
01:13:18,927 --> 01:13:20,792
You feel good.

1122
01:13:22,197 --> 01:13:23,221
Ah!

1123
01:13:23,399 --> 01:13:26,596
Huh? That's good.

1124
01:13:28,804 --> 01:13:31,796
- A little more. Good.
- Ah!

1125
01:14:28,330 --> 01:14:32,289
In his final poem,
Mallarmé writes of shipwreck:

1126
01:14:32,468 --> 01:14:34,993
<i>The man without a vessel</i>

1127
01:14:35,404 --> 01:14:37,770
<i>A solitary plume</i>

1128
01:14:37,940 --> 01:14:41,432
<i>Overwhelmed
Untouched</i>

1129
01:14:41,643 --> 01:14:43,543
With very few words on the page...

1130
01:14:43,712 --> 01:14:49,378
...the writing itself creates space
for silence and pause.

1131
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:54,512
<i>For in this world of shipwreck...</i>

1132
01:14:54,690 --> 01:14:58,217
<i>...there is hope in uncertainty.</i>

1133
01:15:04,333 --> 01:15:06,028
Hi, Alice.

1134
01:15:06,201 --> 01:15:08,829
It's Lola.

1135
01:15:09,238 --> 01:15:12,674
I know that you probably don't
want to see me...

1136
01:15:12,841 --> 01:15:17,540
...but I would love to see you.

1137
01:15:19,248 --> 01:15:23,480
I'm around, if you want.

1138
01:15:24,386 --> 01:15:26,047
Okay.

1139
01:15:26,455 --> 01:15:27,945
Bye.

1140
01:15:35,631 --> 01:15:38,725
<i>Hey, remember how much
I loved Cinderella as a kid?</i>

1141
01:15:40,269 --> 01:15:42,999
- What a sick fucking kid.
- It's a classic.

1142
01:15:43,171 --> 01:15:46,629
It's what messes little girls up,
because we all get obsessed with shoes...

1143
01:15:46,808 --> 01:15:50,369
...and then we think that some guy
is gonna come put them on our feet.

1144
01:15:50,546 --> 01:15:54,038
- That is a mars job.
- I actually thought I was living in a fairy tale...

1145
01:15:54,216 --> 01:15:58,550
...and that Luke's shoe fit me perfectly.

1146
01:15:58,720 --> 01:16:02,656
I guess no shoe is a perfect fit,
especially when you have slightly irregular feet.

1147
01:16:03,158 --> 01:16:06,924
Right. Well, you gotta find
your own style, baby.

1148
01:16:07,095 --> 01:16:08,960
Are you telling me to go shoe shopping?

1149
01:16:09,131 --> 01:16:10,928
I have a friend, Diane...

1150
01:16:11,099 --> 01:16:13,897
No, she has an eight-and-a-half
and a nine-and-a-half.

1151
01:16:14,069 --> 01:16:16,094
That's not even close. That's a whole size.

1152
01:16:16,271 --> 01:16:17,932
- That's depressing, Mom.
- No, I know.

1153
01:16:18,106 --> 01:16:21,940
It's scary to think that one side could grow
and the other side doesn't.

1154
01:16:22,110 --> 01:16:24,874
- It's disgusting.
- Imagine her bras.

1155
01:16:28,150 --> 01:16:29,344
I got you something.

1156
01:16:29,518 --> 01:16:32,214
Oh, my God, you shouldn't have.

1157
01:16:32,688 --> 01:16:33,814
It's a douche.

1158
01:16:34,022 --> 01:16:35,922
I know you've been wanting a new one.

1159
01:16:36,091 --> 01:16:38,616
- I'm douchey.
- I'm douchey.

1160
01:16:38,794 --> 01:16:42,924
- Eh.
- I'm so sorry about how I acted.

1161
01:16:43,098 --> 01:16:45,589
I'm sorry too.
I should have told you sooner.

1162
01:16:45,767 --> 01:16:47,962
- I was so stupid.
- Don't... Don't be sorry.

1163
01:16:48,136 --> 01:16:51,867
I am so happy for you and Henry.

1164
01:16:52,040 --> 01:16:53,871
Really.

1165
01:16:54,042 --> 01:16:55,509
I love you.

1166
01:16:57,312 --> 01:16:58,370
I love you.

1167
01:16:58,547 --> 01:17:01,277
Oh. Ahem.

1168
01:17:02,451 --> 01:17:05,682
So I want to have a party for my birthday
and I need your help.

1169
01:17:05,854 --> 01:17:07,344
- Is this a trick?
- No.

1170
01:17:07,522 --> 01:17:11,856
I know I have never had a birthday party before,
but I think I'm ready.

1171
01:17:12,027 --> 01:17:14,086
Okay. Yeah, I'm loving it.

1172
01:17:14,262 --> 01:17:16,457
Let's... What are we doing?
Going to Six Flags?

1173
01:17:16,632 --> 01:17:20,534
No, I just think I need a clean start...

1174
01:17:20,702 --> 01:17:25,401
...because I've really fucked up
all my friendships over the past year.

1175
01:17:25,574 --> 01:17:26,939
- So...
- No.

1176
01:17:27,109 --> 01:17:28,576
It's like everyone always says:

1177
01:17:28,744 --> 01:17:31,542
To love someone else,
you have to learn how to love yourself.

1178
01:17:31,713 --> 01:17:35,410
But I don't know, after this year,
I don't think that's true.

1179
01:17:35,584 --> 01:17:40,351
I think to love yourself,
you have to learn how to love other people.

1180
01:17:46,728 --> 01:17:48,355
Illuminati.
The Illuminati.

1181
01:17:48,530 --> 01:17:51,055
And they say that Hillary Clinton is a lizard.

1182
01:17:51,233 --> 01:17:56,432
The thing is, if you look at the sky enough,
you will see lasers shooting out of the moon.

1183
01:17:56,605 --> 01:18:00,473
If you really, really look,
because I have seen it.

1184
01:18:00,642 --> 01:18:04,271
It was on YouTube, but I did see it
with my eyes through a computer.

1185
01:18:04,446 --> 01:18:06,880
- It's because the apocalypse is coming.
- I know.

1186
01:18:07,049 --> 01:18:10,041
- I'm moving to Canada.
- I'm just gonna try to keep to my routine.

1187
01:18:10,218 --> 01:18:12,243
All right, I'm getting pizza.

1188
01:18:12,421 --> 01:18:13,547
Oh, my God.

1189
01:18:13,722 --> 01:18:14,746
- Hey!
You came!

1190
01:18:14,923 --> 01:18:16,254
I'm so happy you came!

1191
01:18:16,425 --> 01:18:18,655
You never have a birthday party.

1192
01:18:18,827 --> 01:18:23,389
I'm having a bit of a rebirth,
so I thought it was cause for celebration.

1193
01:18:24,232 --> 01:18:26,393
- About the whole Alice thing...
- No.

1194
01:18:26,568 --> 01:18:28,297
- It's so fine.
- Really?

1195
01:18:28,470 --> 01:18:29,903
We don't hold grudges.

1196
01:18:30,739 --> 01:18:33,572
Well, I am actually still upset
that you lost my Boyz II Men cassette.

1197
01:18:34,943 --> 01:18:37,173
Oh, I don't speak Spanish.

1198
01:18:37,345 --> 01:18:39,210
- Ugh.
- Ugh. Come on.

1199
01:18:40,382 --> 01:18:41,940
Mm.

1200
01:18:42,184 --> 01:18:44,175
Missed you.

1201
01:18:48,824 --> 01:18:51,987
- Did you know he was coming?
- No.

1202
01:18:53,128 --> 01:18:55,187
I'm gonna get some nibblers.

1203
01:18:59,634 --> 01:19:00,658
Hey.

1204
01:19:04,239 --> 01:19:07,333
- What are you doing here?
- I couldn't miss this.

1205
01:19:08,110 --> 01:19:10,635
It's just kind of a picnic.

1206
01:19:12,013 --> 01:19:14,675
Yeah, well, I didn't want to miss this...

1207
01:19:14,850 --> 01:19:17,250
...because I miss this.

1208
01:19:17,419 --> 01:19:19,785
- Are you speaking in rhyming verse now?
- Yes.

1209
01:19:19,955 --> 01:19:21,752
Because I'm nervous. Uh...

1210
01:19:22,457 --> 01:19:25,221
Look, I just gotta say this. Um...

1211
01:19:26,428 --> 01:19:27,793
I mean, I got my space.

1212
01:19:27,963 --> 01:19:31,626
- I just ended up in another relationship.
- Right.

1213
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:33,427
But it's fleeting.

1214
01:19:34,169 --> 01:19:35,397
And it's not real.

1215
01:19:35,570 --> 01:19:38,164
And I just think I needed some distance
to realize that.

1216
01:19:38,974 --> 01:19:42,205
- Was that all you needed?
- Yeah.

1217
01:19:42,377 --> 01:19:45,278
I mean, now we can go at this
from a totally new way.

1218
01:19:46,281 --> 01:19:48,943
I don't know what to say.

1219
01:19:51,453 --> 01:19:54,445
You didn't want me or us or any of it.

1220
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:58,559
And then you got this distance.

1221
01:20:00,428 --> 01:20:02,726
But the thing is, I haven't, really.

1222
01:20:02,898 --> 01:20:04,866
What do you mean?
I mean, you've had time.

1223
01:20:05,033 --> 01:20:07,001
It's been months.

1224
01:20:07,169 --> 01:20:10,138
But I spent all that time obsessing over you.

1225
01:20:10,305 --> 01:20:11,863
And other people.

1226
01:20:12,040 --> 01:20:16,977
And I think I finally have some
perspective on what I need.

1227
01:20:18,013 --> 01:20:21,346
- Which is?
- Which is...

1228
01:20:21,516 --> 01:20:25,714
I'm so touched that you want to start
all of this back up again...

1229
01:20:25,887 --> 01:20:29,653
...but I'm taken. Heh.

1230
01:20:32,194 --> 01:20:34,628
By myself. I...

1231
01:20:35,497 --> 01:20:38,523
I've just got to do me for a while.

1232
01:20:43,238 --> 01:20:45,172
Lola!

1233
01:20:45,340 --> 01:20:47,137
I'm coming!

1234
01:20:51,613 --> 01:20:55,105
Okay, yeah. Come on.
Let's go, folks. Fire up this pastry.

1235
01:20:55,283 --> 01:20:56,614
Here we go, here we go.

1236
01:20:56,785 --> 01:20:59,049
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Okay, okay.

1237
01:20:59,221 --> 01:21:00,313
All right.

1238
01:21:00,488 --> 01:21:01,921
Birthday rap!

1239
01:21:02,090 --> 01:21:03,580
- Get ready.
- Okay.

1240
01:21:03,758 --> 01:21:05,817
<i>You're 6, you're Lola</i>

1241
01:21:05,994 --> 01:21:07,757
<i>You live in Angola</i>

1242
01:21:07,929 --> 01:21:09,624
<i>You're African, except you're not</i>

1243
01:21:09,798 --> 01:21:11,789
<i>But you're just as hot</i>

1244
01:21:11,967 --> 01:21:15,232
<i>You're a writer, you're a fighter
Like a Mark Wahlberg fighter</i>

1245
01:21:15,403 --> 01:21:17,200
<i>- Except you're Donnie
- I'm your mommy</i>

1246
01:21:17,372 --> 01:21:19,203
<i>And I'm your friend who's black</i>

1247
01:21:19,374 --> 01:21:21,638
This is not what we rehearsed.
Happy birthday!

1248
01:21:21,810 --> 01:21:23,778
Happy birthday!

1249
01:21:31,186 --> 01:21:32,483
All right, let's eat cake.

1250
01:21:35,824 --> 01:21:37,416
Thank you.

1251
01:21:41,496 --> 01:21:42,656
Ooh!

1252
01:22:00,982 --> 01:22:04,315
<i>I have 29 years before the next upheaval.</i>

1253
01:22:04,486 --> 01:22:09,890
<i>Before that crazy planet comes back
to wreak havoc on my life.</i>

1254
01:22:10,058 --> 01:22:11,787
<i>And when it's over...</i>

1255
01:22:11,960 --> 01:22:17,762
<i>...I hope I feel exactly the way I do right now.</i>
