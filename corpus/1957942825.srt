1
00:01:15,859 --> 00:01:19,352
(man) The Wild West created
many amazing legends:

2
00:01:19,429 --> 00:01:22,228
Geronimo, Wyatt Earp, Nat Love...

3
00:01:22,899 --> 00:01:24,389
All of them deadly.

4
00:01:24,468 --> 00:01:26,800
But none deadlier than this man:

5
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:29,999
The Cherokee Kid.

6
00:01:34,244 --> 00:01:36,645
So you're the Undertaker.

7
00:01:47,324 --> 00:01:50,259
Now it's your turn to die.

8
00:01:56,733 --> 00:01:59,930
Good night, Kid.
Sweet dreams.

9
00:02:18,355 --> 00:02:20,722
- (man) Is he dead?
- He's graveyard dead.

10
00:02:20,791 --> 00:02:23,158
Ah, well...

11
00:02:23,794 --> 00:02:26,320
Perhaps you would like
to double this reward.

12
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:28,160
| have a very interesting railroad...

13
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:32,498
| bury my dead before any
business transpires, Mr. Bloomington.

14
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:34,697
Well...

15
00:02:34,771 --> 00:02:39,368
Uh, | have here some deeds that ...

16
00:02:39,443 --> 00:02:42,105
Are you deaf?
A brave man has died.

17
00:02:42,179 --> 00:02:43,977
He deserves a proper eulogy.

18
00:02:44,047 --> 00:02:48,280
Just how long do you think it's gonna take
to finish eulogizing this...

19
00:02:48,352 --> 00:02:53,085
How long would it take to eulogize
a great man like Montezuma

20
00:02:53,156 --> 00:02:57,753
or Thomas Jefferson... or Robin Hood?

21
00:02:57,828 --> 00:02:59,660
How long?

22
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:02,256
We'll bury this man at noon tomorrow.

23
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,994
Noon tomorrow.

24
00:03:38,502 --> 00:03:43,668
(priest) So many people here
from far and wide

25
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:46,107
because a man has died.

26
00:03:46,176 --> 00:03:49,168
But who exactly was this man?

27
00:03:49,246 --> 00:03:52,011
You know who he was.
You and | raised him!

28
00:03:52,082 --> 00:03:54,073
You tell 'em. You tell 'em who he was!

29
00:03:54,151 --> 00:03:55,619
1 will, mother, I'll tell 'em.

30
00:03:55,685 --> 00:03:58,882
- You tell 'em what a good boy he was!
- Elizabeth...

31
00:03:58,955 --> 00:04:02,016
There are others here
who would like to get a word in edgewise.

32
00:04:02,092 --> 00:04:03,150
(man) That's right!

33
00:04:03,226 --> 00:04:07,788
I, Juan... Nepomuceno Cortina,

34
00:04:07,864 --> 00:04:11,198
hero of the Mexican people,
would like to speak.

35
00:04:11,268 --> 00:04:15,466
For it is | who taught the Cherokee Kid
everything he knows.

36
00:04:15,539 --> 00:04:19,271
That's why he's laid up in that box now.

37
00:04:21,978 --> 00:04:26,677
The Cherokee Kid was the most noble,

38
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:32,587
the most courageous human being
the world has ever known.

39
00:04:33,457 --> 00:04:36,893
But let us begin at the beginning.

40
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,727
Before he became known
as the Cherokee Kid,

41
00:04:41,798 --> 00:04:46,565
the Cherokee Kid was... just a kid.

42
00:04:47,637 --> 00:04:50,572
His name was Isaiah Turner.

43
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,007
He had a big brother named Jedediah.

44
00:04:53,076 --> 00:04:57,104
Now, even back then, the railroad men
were forcing the homesteaders

45
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,239
to sell their land for pennies.

46
00:04:59,316 --> 00:05:04,117
When the boy's father stood up to them,
they killed him like a dog.

47
00:05:04,187 --> 00:05:07,384
The very next day
Jedediah took his revenge.

48
00:05:07,457 --> 00:05:09,289
He sneaked into the railroad camp

49
00:05:09,359 --> 00:05:11,919
and shot the man
who took his father's life.

50
00:05:11,995 --> 00:05:16,557
Jed! Now don't you mistake
stupidity for courage.

51
00:05:25,509 --> 00:05:30,470
(Cortina) That night Mama gave
to the boys their father's favorite hat.

52
00:05:30,547 --> 00:05:34,711
When the bad men came, Mama
and Jedediah put their plan into action.

53
00:05:34,784 --> 00:05:37,481
But first they put young Isaiah
in the wood box.

54
00:05:37,554 --> 00:05:39,852
I'll be damned if I'm gonna
let you lynch my baby!

55
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:42,949
1 will kill him myself before | let you at him!

56
00:05:43,026 --> 00:05:46,121
- No, Mama, no!
- Baby, let it go. Let it go!

57
00:05:46,196 --> 00:05:47,664
No!

58
00:05:52,469 --> 00:05:54,233
No, baby, | didn't shoot Jed.

59
00:05:54,304 --> 00:05:56,966
We was just pretending
so that Jed could get away.

60
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,168
Let 'em have it!

61
00:06:10,887 --> 00:06:13,015
(man) Ed!

62
00:06:13,089 --> 00:06:14,523
(gunshot)

63
00:06:14,591 --> 00:06:18,186
- You OK, Mr. Bloomington?
- Nobody can stand in the way of progress.

64
00:06:18,261 --> 00:06:20,525
Go, get him!

65
00:06:26,269 --> 00:06:28,260
(gunshot)

66
00:06:32,943 --> 00:06:34,934
| got him!

67
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:39,774
(Cortina) Like the terrified antelope,

68
00:06:39,849 --> 00:06:45,117
the brave little kid was running
and running, night and day.

69
00:06:45,188 --> 00:06:49,284
Guided only by his still-developing
sense of direction,

70
00:06:49,359 --> 00:06:51,760
he wandered aimlessly,

71
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:54,024
not knowing where fo go.

72
00:06:54,097 --> 00:06:59,866
Until one day the hand of fate guided him
into the lap of good fortune.

73
00:06:59,936 --> 00:07:02,030
Reverend and Mrs. Peel,

74
00:07:02,105 --> 00:07:04,699
having no children of their own,

75
00:07:04,774 --> 00:07:08,142
believed young Isaiah
to be a gift from God.

76
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:12,543
Pow! Got you, Bloomington!

77
00:07:14,718 --> 00:07:17,483
Pow! | got you too, Bonner!

78
00:07:18,655 --> 00:07:22,683
Reverend, tell him what the good book say.
Tell him what it say about killing.

79
00:07:23,893 --> 00:07:27,989
Son, the Bible sayeth, "Thou shalt not kill."

80
00:07:28,064 --> 00:07:30,499
The Bible say, "Eye for an eye."

81
00:07:30,567 --> 00:07:33,332
So I'm gonna shoot him in the eye!

82
00:07:33,403 --> 00:07:35,235
Pow!

83
00:07:35,305 --> 00:07:36,500
Pow!

84
00:07:36,573 --> 00:07:38,564
Pow!

85
00:07:41,811 --> 00:07:45,543
(Cortina) Then, about 18 years later,

86
00:07:46,149 --> 00:07:49,983
the Kid had grown into a strong,
sure-footed young man.

87
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:53,250
And still he clung to his childhood dreams.

88
00:07:53,323 --> 00:07:56,782
Bonner, Bloomington, you're both dead.

89
00:07:59,963 --> 00:08:02,557
- (Mrs. Peel) Isaiah?
- Coming, Ma!

90
00:08:02,632 --> 00:08:04,031
Whoo!

91
00:08:07,137 --> 00:08:11,040
(Cortina) One day in town,
the Kid stumbled across the face

92
00:08:11,107 --> 00:08:15,840
of the man he hated
with every breath he took.

93
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:19,041
Bloomington was now
the mayor of El Paso.

94
00:08:19,115 --> 00:08:21,174
He was coming to Pinedale to speak.

95
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:25,188
Isaiah vowed to go there
and silence him forever.

96
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:30,222
Just one sandwich, Ma?

97
00:08:30,293 --> 00:08:33,752
Reverend, you tell him that if he gets
hungry, he can just come on home.

98
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:36,800
- Tell him.
- I'll tell him, mother.

99
00:08:36,866 --> 00:08:40,700
Tell him we know that this is
all about Bloomington. Tell him.

100
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:43,330
Son, violence is not the answer.

101
00:08:43,406 --> 00:08:45,340
Ma, Pa, | can't thank you enough

102
00:08:45,408 --> 00:08:48,400
for taking me in and raising me
when | lost my family.

103
00:08:48,478 --> 00:08:51,209
But | got to go out and find out who | am.

104
00:08:51,281 --> 00:08:53,875
I love y'all and I'm gonna miss you.

105
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:56,775
Pa.

106
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:00,582
Oh.

107
00:09:00,657 --> 00:09:03,592
- Ma, can | ask you something?
- Yes, baby.

108
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:06,391
Ever since I've been little,
whenever you'd talk to me,

109
00:09:06,463 --> 00:09:09,228
you'd talk to him
and I'd be standing right here.

110
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:12,564
You tell him that he is gonna
go and get himself killed.

111
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:15,696
- Now, you tell him!
- (Isaiah) C'mon, Old Lightning.

112
00:09:17,073 --> 00:09:19,542
Well, Pa, I'm gonna be going.

113
00:09:19,609 --> 00:09:20,770
Whoa.

114
00:09:20,844 --> 00:09:22,505
Bye.

115
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,406
(horse whinnies)

116
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:28,383
I'm OK. I'm OK, Pa.

117
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:30,778
Whoa, Lightning.

118
00:09:30,854 --> 00:09:32,982
I'm just gonna walk him, Pa.

119
00:09:33,056 --> 00:09:35,650
'Cause he's kinda touchy right now.

120
00:09:35,725 --> 00:09:36,783
Come on.

121
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:39,295
"Vengeance is mine," sayeth the Lord.

122
00:09:41,598 --> 00:09:45,057
Killing is a sin.
And Pinedale's the other way!

123
00:09:45,135 --> 00:09:47,536
| know!

124
00:09:47,604 --> 00:09:50,301
That way!

125
00:09:50,373 --> 00:09:51,898
One sandwich.

126
00:09:51,975 --> 00:09:56,378
He'll be back here before sundown,
if he can ever find this place.

127
00:09:56,446 --> 00:09:58,005
Oh, Charles!

128
00:09:58,081 --> 00:10:01,107
He took that rusty gun off the mantle!

129
00:10:03,186 --> 00:10:09,819
(Cortina) Thus began his magnificent
quest to find a town called Pinedale,

130
00:10:09,893 --> 00:10:14,990
and o find the despicable excuse
for a man who had killed his family.

131
00:10:16,466 --> 00:10:18,958
Oh, man, where am |?

132
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:20,696
(turkey gobbling)

133
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:23,535
(Cortina) When he exhausted
his supply of sandwiches,

134
00:10:23,606 --> 00:10:28,635
he feasted on natural foods
and wild game.

135
00:10:34,751 --> 00:10:37,083
(knock)

136
00:10:37,153 --> 00:10:39,554
Hello? Anybody home?

137
00:10:40,757 --> 00:10:43,454
Just looking for some food.

138
00:10:43,526 --> 00:10:45,153
(gobbles)

139
00:10:47,297 --> 00:10:51,029
Just me and you, Turkey,
and one of us got to die.

140
00:10:51,868 --> 00:10:56,601
Let me go, you dirty, lowdown,
scraggly two-legged cockroach!

141
00:10:56,673 --> 00:10:59,074
Ooh! Why, you...

142
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:02,768
What kind of crook
knocks off a whorehouse anyway?

143
00:11:02,846 --> 00:11:04,780
Why don't you go out
and hit a bank like a real man?

144
00:11:04,848 --> 00:11:07,681
C'mon, give me some loving,
you cheap whore!

145
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,013
Cheap?

146
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:11,952
| ain't never done it for free in my life.

147
00:11:12,021 --> 00:11:14,649
| ain't never paid for it.

148
00:11:15,558 --> 00:11:17,788
C'mon.

149
00:11:17,861 --> 00:11:19,625
Ha ha! C'mon.

150
00:11:19,696 --> 00:11:21,323
Agh! Get off of me!

151
00:11:21,397 --> 00:11:25,630
Why don't you shut that stinking mouth
of yours before the bats come flying out?

152
00:11:25,702 --> 00:11:27,830
- Shut up!
- You paying for this.

153
00:11:27,904 --> 00:11:29,702
| know you got some money.
You paying for this.

154
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:32,139
- Get off of me!
- (gobbling)

155
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:33,539
(woman) What?

156
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:36,841
Hi.

157
00:11:36,913 --> 00:11:39,109
You dead, boy.

158
00:11:39,816 --> 00:11:41,250
(woman) Why, you...!

159
00:11:42,151 --> 00:11:43,846
Aghh!

160
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:53,626
- Agh!
- (gunshot)

161
00:12:04,407 --> 00:12:06,671
| think he's dead.

162
00:12:06,743 --> 00:12:09,405
| killed 2 man... with a turkey.

163
00:12:10,413 --> 00:12:11,972
What am | gonna do?
They're gonna send me to jail.

164
00:12:12,048 --> 00:12:15,143
Lord Almighty,
I've been saved by a colored boy!

165
00:12:15,218 --> 00:12:18,119
A sweet, kind, brave,

166
00:12:18,187 --> 00:12:21,919
extremely good-looking,
very light-complected...

167
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:24,085
Mmm, mmm, mmm, horny brat!

168
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,960
Ma'am, you are truly
a lovely and inviting woman,

169
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:30,022
and all the womanly parts
a man would want.

170
00:12:30,099 --> 00:12:33,899
It's just that | ain't never
been with a woman before.

171
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:39,409
| had some turkey before, and I'd rather
have some of that bird, ma'am.

172
00:12:39,475 --> 00:12:41,773
What's that say on his belt?

173
00:12:42,779 --> 00:12:44,941
His name, Jake Carver.

174
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:48,177
- Can't you read?
- Of course | can.

175
00:12:48,251 --> 00:12:51,050
| just... can't read English.

176
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,282
I's French.

177
00:12:53,356 --> 00:12:55,051
(Cortina laughs)

178
00:12:55,124 --> 00:12:57,991
Again, good fortune smiled on our hero.

179
00:12:58,061 --> 00:13:03,295
Yeah, | killed Jake Carver.
You got something to say about that?

180
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:04,424
(gunshot)

181
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:08,937
(Cortina) He took refuge for the night
in the charming little coltage,

182
00:13:09,005 --> 00:13:12,202
where a nice Christian girl
prepared for him

183
00:13:12,275 --> 00:13:14,937
a delicious home-cooked meal.

184
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,639
Gobble, gobble.

185
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:20,706
Gobble, gobble.

186
00:13:21,617 --> 00:13:24,587
(Cortina) All night long he dreamed

187
00:13:24,654 --> 00:13:27,521
of leftover turkey sandwiches.

188
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:33,222
But in the morning, the girl
and the bird had flown the coop.

189
00:13:33,296 --> 00:13:34,695
Oh, she took the turkey.

190
00:13:34,764 --> 00:13:36,698
(Cortina) Bloomington
would be in Pinedale today.

191
00:13:36,766 --> 00:13:40,566
Isaiah had to get there,
by hook or by crook.

192
00:13:40,636 --> 00:13:43,128
Hey! How you doing, gentlemen?

193
00:13:43,206 --> 00:13:46,232
- Morning.
- Morning! How d'you do?

194
00:13:46,309 --> 00:13:49,040
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm... Jake Carver.

195
00:13:50,013 --> 00:13:52,243
- Jake Carver?
-Yes, lam.

196
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:54,808
Damn!

197
00:13:54,884 --> 00:13:57,046
It sure as hell is a small world,
ain't it, boys?

198
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:01,353
- Sure is.
- And we're Jake Carver's gang!

199
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:05,056
Yeah, howdy.

200
00:14:05,128 --> 00:14:08,564
- Hey, Jake, I'm your cousin.
- I'm your cousin too.

201
00:14:08,631 --> 00:14:11,293
| ain't your cousin,
so | guess that makes me your aunt.

202
00:14:11,367 --> 00:14:13,893
Wait a minute, now let me explain.

203
00:14:15,605 --> 00:14:19,007
Gim Bob, Jake's out back,
dead as a skunk.

204
00:14:19,075 --> 00:14:21,066
No sign of the girl.

205
00:14:21,978 --> 00:14:23,969
Wait a minute.
Y'all don't think | killed him, did you?

206
00:14:24,047 --> 00:14:27,210
Jake was my best... | grew up with Jake.
That whore killed him!

207
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:29,047
| always told Jake
from the time he was young

208
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:31,018
that these whores were gonna be
the death of him.

209
00:14:31,087 --> 00:14:33,556
Now you know how he was,
always chasing women.

210
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:36,593
From the time he was young, he was
always trying to look up girls' petticoats.

211
00:14:36,659 --> 00:14:38,388
I'd say, "Jake, stop. Jake, stop."

212
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:41,920
There was too much stuff. Petticoats,
corsets... He wouldn't listen to me.

213
00:14:41,998 --> 00:14:44,865
We'd be running off playing tag
and hide-and-go-seek.

214
00:14:44,934 --> 00:14:48,370
But Jake didn't like them kind of games.
No, no, sir, he didn't.

215
00:14:48,438 --> 00:14:51,032
And what he'd do was,
he'd take our arms behind our backs

216
00:14:51,107 --> 00:14:52,871
and he'd twist 'em till we screamed.

217
00:14:52,942 --> 00:14:55,411
And then he had this floorboard
from his mammy's house

218
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:58,448
and he would take it and
whoop us upside the head.

219
00:14:58,514 --> 00:15:00,243
Then he'd take whiskey
from his daddy's cabinet,

220
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:04,310
- pour it down my throat till | wet myself.
- (laughter)

221
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,121
That's our Jake!

222
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:15,798
Well, it's a shame Jake's gone now,
'cause he had a big job for us to do.

223
00:15:16,766 --> 00:15:19,565
- What kind of job?
- He didn't tell you?

224
00:15:19,635 --> 00:15:23,594
- No, he didn't tell me about no job.
- This is a big job.

225
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:26,608
This is the biggest job.
That's why he brought me out here.

226
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:29,236
We were gonna rob a bank.

227
00:15:29,312 --> 00:15:31,747
- Where?
- In Pinedale.

228
00:15:32,482 --> 00:15:34,416
Pinedale?

229
00:15:34,484 --> 00:15:35,576
Yeah.

230
00:15:35,651 --> 00:15:39,588
A lot of money there too, but it looks like
it's gonna stay in that bank now.

231
00:15:39,655 --> 00:15:42,124
Jake's gone and he had
the plans in his head.

232
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:44,353
So I'm gonna go out and bury him
before them animals tear him up.

233
00:15:44,427 --> 00:15:46,987
Ain't nothin' worse than seeing
a man's body laying there and rotting.

234
00:15:47,063 --> 00:15:48,929
You don't know what it is, you walk up on it,

235
00:15:48,998 --> 00:15:52,798
and you think it's a dead dog,
but it's a person. The horses get spooked.

236
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:55,429
So I'm gonna go get him 'cause | don't
wanna see that happen out there.

237
00:15:55,505 --> 00:15:57,496
- Nice meeting you.
- I'll bet.

238
00:15:57,573 --> 00:16:01,032
Uh-uh!
You're going the wrong way, friend.

239
00:16:02,011 --> 00:16:05,208
Pinedale's about ten miles north of here.

240
00:16:05,281 --> 00:16:07,545
| figured I'd just...

241
00:16:07,617 --> 00:16:11,952
Then again, it would be right
to honor Jake by robbing that bank.

242
00:16:26,869 --> 00:16:29,236
Well, you told me Pinedale was that way.
| wouldn't have gone that way if...

243
00:16:29,305 --> 00:16:30,898
Just get.

244
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:36,268
(Gim Bob) Now, here's the new plan.

245
00:16:36,345 --> 00:16:38,370
We go in the bank.

246
00:16:38,447 --> 00:16:41,610
You go up to the teller,
tell her you're robbin' the bank.

247
00:16:41,684 --> 00:16:44,312
And then... you rob the bank.

248
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:48,656
You've been thinking about this plan
for a while, huh?

249
00:16:48,724 --> 00:16:50,988
Maybe we oughta take
a couple more minutes.

250
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:53,154
We'll just go on in there.

251
00:16:53,229 --> 00:16:55,527
- Hi, can | help you?
- Hi, how you doing?

252
00:16:55,598 --> 00:16:57,930
- I'm fine, thank you.
- That is a right smart tie you got on there.

253
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,332
Thank you very much.
| bought it in St. Louis.

254
00:17:00,403 --> 00:17:02,667
St. Louis?
My grandmama's buried there.

255
00:17:02,738 --> 00:17:04,365
Oh, well, it's a dangerous place.

256
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,535
- Yeah, she was bit by a rabid rabbit.
- A rabbit rabbit?

257
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:10,307
- A rabbit with rabies.
- A rabbit with rabies?

258
00:17:10,379 --> 00:17:12,507
| thought you were talking about
identical twin rabbits.

259
00:17:12,582 --> 00:17:15,779
- No, just one rabbit with rabies.
- Oh, | see. I'm sorry to hear that.

260
00:17:15,851 --> 00:17:18,218
- How can | help you?
- Actually | was thinking about...

261
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:20,312
Maybe you wanna open a new account?

262
00:17:20,389 --> 00:17:22,858
Because if you do today,
you get great gifts.

263
00:17:22,925 --> 00:17:25,951
For example,
if you give us $25, you get this.

264
00:17:26,028 --> 00:17:27,928
It's a cake of Grandpa's pine tar soap.

265
00:17:27,997 --> 00:17:30,261
Now, | have heard about this.
This the one with witch hazel?

266
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:33,030
- Absolutely, it will open up your pores.
- It smells so fresh.

267
00:17:33,102 --> 00:17:35,366
It's guaranteed to leave you
refreshingly clean.

268
00:17:35,438 --> 00:17:37,497
| have some other friends need to be clean.
Can | ask them?

269
00:17:37,573 --> 00:17:38,404
- Of course.
- Thank you.

270
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:39,498
- You're welcome.
- You're a very nice man.

271
00:17:39,575 --> 00:17:41,236
Thank you. You too.

272
00:17:42,111 --> 00:17:46,048
- Billy Bob?
- It's Gim. It's Gim Bob with a G. Gim Bob.

273
00:17:46,115 --> 00:17:47,913
I'm sorry, all them Bobs
are throwing me off.

274
00:17:47,984 --> 00:17:49,952
Ray Bob, and Jimmy Bob.
| can't get all the Bobs right.

275
00:17:50,019 --> 00:17:52,954
- Well, it's Gim Bob with a G.
- | wanna show you something.

276
00:17:53,022 --> 00:17:55,252
If we give the man $25
to start an account,

277
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:57,224
we'll get some free pine tar soap.

278
00:17:57,293 --> 00:18:00,957
And as much as we're on the road
together, this'll kill the stinkies.

279
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:03,294
| don't take a bath.

280
00:18:03,366 --> 00:18:05,630
Just go over there and rob the bank.

281
00:18:05,701 --> 00:18:08,432
- Just think about how you smell.
- All right.

282
00:18:09,205 --> 00:18:10,400
They don't like the soap.

283
00:18:10,473 --> 00:18:15,468
Maybe you should tell them if they give us
$100 to deposit, they get a gingham apron.

284
00:18:15,544 --> 00:18:17,137
- Hush my mouth.
- A gingham apron.

285
00:18:17,213 --> 00:18:18,442
- And | cook.
- Oh, you do?

286
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:21,313
- | can cook rabbit.
- That's good, | hope it's not rabid.

287
00:18:21,384 --> 00:18:22,943
That's funny.
You a funny man.

288
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:24,453
You know what we do
with the gingham apron?

289
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,648
We hand-embroider your name
right across the front.

290
00:18:26,722 --> 00:18:29,054
- Well, my name's Isaiah.
- That's a beautiful name.

291
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:30,524
- It's Biblical.
- God bless you.

292
00:18:30,593 --> 00:18:32,288
- Thank you.
- That was my grandmother's name.

293
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:33,021
Isaiah?

294
00:18:33,095 --> 00:18:35,086
Yeah, it's a man's name
but she was very mannish.

295
00:18:35,164 --> 00:18:36,928
She wore pants,
but that's a different story.

296
00:18:36,999 --> 00:18:39,593
We'll put the name right here,
like it says "Teller" for me.

297
00:18:39,669 --> 00:18:41,228
- That's your name?
- No, that's my job.

298
00:18:41,304 --> 00:18:42,066
Oh, sorry.

299
00:18:42,138 --> 00:18:45,472
So why don't you go tell them about
the gingham apron?

300
00:18:47,176 --> 00:18:50,009
You're not gonna believe this.
They have these gingham aprons.

301
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:52,377
We put $100 in,
we put our money together...

302
00:18:52,448 --> 00:18:56,578
- Now what you want me to tell him?
- Just tell him we're here to rob the bank!

303
00:18:56,652 --> 00:18:58,848
You don't have to spit on me.

304
00:19:01,624 --> 00:19:03,854
These gentlemen are here to rob the bank.

305
00:19:06,662 --> 00:19:14,126
| forgot to tell you. If you give us $300
to deposit, you get this nice big gun.

306
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:17,631
(Cortina) The Kid knew
that Bloomington was close by.

307
00:19:17,707 --> 00:19:19,436
He could smell him.

308
00:19:19,508 --> 00:19:24,275
Unfortunately, Frank Bonner
had already sniffed out the Kid.

309
00:19:24,347 --> 00:19:26,748
(Bonner) All right, where is he?

310
00:19:26,816 --> 00:19:29,308
Mr. Bloomington would like to meet
the man who shot Jake Carver

311
00:19:29,385 --> 00:19:30,944
and took his whole gang out
single-handed.

312
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:34,388
There's the brave gentleman, Mr. Bonner.

313
00:19:38,894 --> 00:19:43,491
Well, you done good, boy.
Saved us a whole heap of embarrassment.

314
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:46,324
Here's your reward.

315
00:19:48,537 --> 00:19:51,131
(man) Don't spend it all in one place!

316
00:19:51,207 --> 00:19:54,006
- What's the matter, son?
- | ain't your son.

317
00:19:54,076 --> 00:19:56,841
Well, | don't know about that.

318
00:19:56,912 --> 00:20:01,406
| done me a whole lot of colored whores
in my day. | might be your daddy.

319
00:20:02,585 --> 00:20:05,054
(laughter)

320
00:20:05,121 --> 00:20:07,317
What is that, boy?

321
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:13,896
You actually might be dangerous
if you had yourself a real gun.

322
00:20:13,963 --> 00:20:15,954
What a fool.

323
00:20:22,705 --> 00:20:25,106
Somebody kill that son of a bitch!

324
00:20:25,174 --> 00:20:27,336
(Cortina) Then the Kid heard the voice

325
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:33,110
that had been haunting his nightmares
since he was fen years old.

326
00:20:33,182 --> 00:20:37,585
(Bloomington) ..but nobody, | mean
nobody, can stand in the way of progress.

327
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:39,644
(applause)

328
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:42,813
(Bloomington) And friends,

329
00:20:42,892 --> 00:20:45,918
progress is steaming your way
on the American railroad.

330
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:49,693
Now are you gonna climb on board,
or are you gonna get left behind?

331
00:20:49,765 --> 00:20:51,756
(crowd cheers)

332
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:58,630
I'm the man who brought the railroads
to Fort Worth and Abilene.

333
00:20:58,707 --> 00:21:00,232
But | have a greater plan.

334
00:21:00,309 --> 00:21:04,268
| want to bring the railroad through
Pinedale to El Paso, up to Denver,

335
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:06,371
on up to San Francisco.

336
00:21:06,449 --> 00:21:08,577
(cheering)

337
00:21:11,821 --> 00:21:15,086
(Bloomington) Now,
| have been asked to consider

338
00:21:15,157 --> 00:21:18,092
running for governor of this great state
in the next election.

339
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,958
If 1 do,

340
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:24,591
when elected, | promise to make available
all the land that I've invested in

341
00:21:24,667 --> 00:21:26,761
to the Southland railroad.

342
00:21:26,836 --> 00:21:28,634
Now, I'm inviting all of you...

343
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:33,141
..to give up your land,
so this man's pockets can get fatter.

344
00:21:33,209 --> 00:21:34,574
(Bloomington) Young man,

345
00:21:34,643 --> 00:21:38,307
I'm the one that's supposed to be
shooting his mouth off up here.

346
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,405
My mother tried to shoot your mouth off.

347
00:21:40,483 --> 00:21:42,781
That's where you got that scar
on your forehead.

348
00:21:42,852 --> 00:21:44,342
- And I'm gonna kill you.
- (clicks)

349
00:21:45,187 --> 00:21:46,712
(gunshots)

350
00:21:48,157 --> 00:21:50,319
(man) He's gettin' away. Let's go!

351
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:52,486
- (man) Hurry!
- (gunshot)

352
00:21:59,869 --> 00:22:02,167
(man) Where'd he go?

353
00:22:08,244 --> 00:22:10,372
(yelling)

354
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:16,643
Gotta go, guys.

355
00:22:29,064 --> 00:22:32,432
(Bloomington) Mr. Bonner... Ooh.

356
00:22:32,501 --> 00:22:36,335
| hate to add insult to injury,
but | need your help.

357
00:22:37,139 --> 00:22:39,699
Now think back a number of years.

358
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:41,834
The night | almost got my head blowed off.

359
00:22:42,344 --> 00:22:45,541
You pursued a dangerous criminal
into the woods.

360
00:22:46,549 --> 00:22:51,851
Yes, sir. | tracked him down like a... dog
and | shot him twice.

361
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:58,887
That Negro that shot you in the ass today
seems to be same said criminal.

362
00:22:58,961 --> 00:23:00,952
He knew all about that night.

363
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:03,226
You are a lying son of a bitch.

364
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:06,462
Just like that whoring mother of yours.

365
00:23:07,937 --> 00:23:11,339
Now, this fugitive in question,

366
00:23:11,407 --> 00:23:15,844
who has wounded
this law-abiding citizen...

367
00:23:15,911 --> 00:23:20,610
I am hereby offering a $1,000 reward
for his carcass.

368
00:23:21,951 --> 00:23:25,012
But you'd better move fast, boys.

369
00:23:25,087 --> 00:23:28,523
Because Mr. Bonner's job is on the line.

370
00:23:28,591 --> 00:23:31,561
Once he gets the lead out of his ass,

371
00:23:32,895 --> 00:23:36,024
he's gonna be movin' fast as hell.

372
00:23:36,098 --> 00:23:38,499
Let's go down to Elle Mae's
and have a little taint, shall we?

373
00:23:38,567 --> 00:23:40,558
Yes, sir!

374
00:23:41,804 --> 00:23:45,104
(Cortina) The Kid knew
he had to lay low for a little bit,

375
00:23:45,174 --> 00:23:48,303
so he sought refuge
with a man of the mountains.

376
00:23:48,377 --> 00:23:51,938
A noble savage
who lived alone in the wilderness.

377
00:23:52,014 --> 00:23:54,449
A gentleman, modest.

378
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:57,884
A man who always heeded nature's call.

379
00:23:58,621 --> 00:24:00,612
Pee break!

380
00:24:06,562 --> 00:24:08,553
(urinating sounds)

381
00:24:22,344 --> 00:24:24,813
The old pissin' trick.

382
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,871
It always works.

383
00:24:34,023 --> 00:24:37,982
(Cortina) Because of the Kid's gift of gab
and the mountain man's loneliness,

384
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:40,358
a strange friendship began.

385
00:24:42,331 --> 00:24:44,823
(Isaiah) What's your name?

386
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,699
- My name's Otter Bob.
- Not the Otter Bob?

387
00:24:48,504 --> 00:24:50,836
Well, I'm Otter Bob.

388
00:24:52,107 --> 00:24:55,805
When | read about you, it said you'd be
a big tall man, a big strong man.

389
00:24:55,878 --> 00:24:57,277
Like the way you look now.

390
00:24:57,346 --> 00:25:00,043
It's just hard to believe that you really here.

391
00:25:00,115 --> 00:25:02,140
Let me ask you something.

392
00:25:02,217 --> 00:25:04,709
How big do you think an otter is?

393
00:25:05,421 --> 00:25:09,153
- | don't know, | ain't never seen one.
- About like that.

394
00:25:09,224 --> 00:25:11,625
Now if a buffalo was behind me right now...

395
00:25:11,694 --> 00:25:14,061
Bam! | could kill him.

396
00:25:14,129 --> 00:25:15,688
'Cause they're big as a house.

397
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:19,792
Goddamn Bill Cody,
that arrogant son of a bitch.

398
00:25:19,868 --> 00:25:22,929
Sure, "Buffalo Bill"'s got a better ring to it
than "Otter Bob,"

399
00:25:23,005 --> 00:25:26,236
but | killed a thousand otters in two days.

400
00:25:26,308 --> 00:25:28,470
He never killed a thousand buffalo.

401
00:25:28,544 --> 00:25:31,275
- You know Buffalo Bill?
- Yeah, | know him.

402
00:25:31,814 --> 00:25:36,376
That's nice. | mean, | always read books
about the mountain men, the gunslingers.

403
00:25:36,452 --> 00:25:40,582
- | always wanted to be a mountain man...
- Wait a minute, wait a minute.

404
00:25:40,656 --> 00:25:42,283
You read?

405
00:25:42,357 --> 00:25:45,258
Yeah, | read. My mama taught
me and my brother Jedediah to read.

406
00:25:45,327 --> 00:25:46,795
That's why | was
in the back of your wagon...

407
00:25:46,862 --> 00:25:48,830
| don't care about that.
| didn't ask you that.

408
00:25:48,897 --> 00:25:51,992
| asked you if you could read.
You see, | got this here book.

409
00:25:52,067 --> 00:25:54,968
I've been carrying it around with me
for about a year now.

410
00:25:55,037 --> 00:25:58,940
I really like it.
You wanna look at it?

411
00:25:59,942 --> 00:26:02,001
- That's one of them dirty books.
- It's not a dirty book.

412
00:26:02,077 --> 00:26:03,408
-Yes, it is.
- It's not a dirty book.

413
00:26:03,479 --> 00:26:05,072
- This is one of them dirty...
- It's not a dirty book.

414
00:26:05,147 --> 00:26:09,744
Here's what | was thinking. Maybe
you could teach me enough to read that.

415
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:13,413
You know, where | could just take it
and go off and be by myself and read

416
00:26:13,489 --> 00:26:14,854
and not bother anybody or anything.

417
00:26:14,923 --> 00:26:18,553
"Fifi and Lola luxuriate in the bathtub..."

418
00:26:18,627 --> 00:26:21,028
- Is that one Fifi with the dark hair?
- Yeah.

419
00:26:21,096 --> 00:26:23,690
| knew it! (laughs)

420
00:26:23,766 --> 00:26:26,428
- Ooh, Fifi's wild!
- Go on, read some more.

421
00:26:26,502 --> 00:26:28,095
- | tell you what.
- Yeah?

422
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:31,504
You take me to El Paso, Texas,
and by the time we get there,

423
00:26:31,573 --> 00:26:34,042
you'll be able to take this book
and read it by yourself.

424
00:26:34,109 --> 00:26:38,876
I'm going to Idaho.
We'll talk about it in the morning, all right?

425
00:26:39,882 --> 00:26:43,716
You mind if | take one of them furs
and use it as a blanket?

426
00:26:43,786 --> 00:26:47,120
- One of my furs?
- One of them furs that you're not using.

427
00:26:47,523 --> 00:26:49,992
- I'm using 'em all.
- You can't use all of 'em.

428
00:26:50,058 --> 00:26:52,288
| use 'em all.

429
00:26:53,428 --> 00:26:55,487
Look... you want a skin?

430
00:26:56,498 --> 00:26:58,557
- This right here is...
- (Isaiah shrieks)

431
00:26:58,634 --> 00:27:02,070
That's a bowie knife.
Jim gave it to me, long time ago.

432
00:27:02,137 --> 00:27:07,541
Take that, go on out there and kill yourself
a critter and make a blankie out of it.

433
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:27,991
(yawns)

434
00:27:37,539 --> 00:27:39,530
Morning.

435
00:27:40,642 --> 00:27:45,273
Maybe it's a good morning for you,
but | had to sleep on the ground.

436
00:27:46,281 --> 00:27:49,842
- What you eating?
- Your blanket.

437
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:53,513
What kind of mountain man would
kill a little old defenseless bunny?

438
00:27:53,589 --> 00:27:55,421
You need to be hunting bear,
mountain lion.

439
00:27:55,490 --> 00:27:57,049
Something that got a chance of killing you.

440
00:27:57,125 --> 00:27:59,116
-Want a leg?
- OK.

441
00:28:01,563 --> 00:28:06,296
| was thinking about
what we were talking about last night.

442
00:28:07,302 --> 00:28:10,328
Idaho is very close to El Paso,

443
00:28:10,405 --> 00:28:12,499
s0 you can ride along with me.

444
00:28:12,574 --> 00:28:15,271
But you gotta teach me to read.

445
00:28:15,911 --> 00:28:17,572
It's a deal.

446
00:28:17,646 --> 00:28:21,276
- But you gotta teach me something too.
- Like?

447
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:23,409
How to be a mountain man.

448
00:28:23,485 --> 00:28:26,113
How to use a knife and hunt,

449
00:28:26,188 --> 00:28:28,885
shoot a gun, tomahawk,

450
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:31,892
make a fire with rocks, make coffee,

451
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:35,521
skin a bear, make some pants out of it,

452
00:28:35,597 --> 00:28:38,464
make my own blanket,

453
00:28:38,533 --> 00:28:40,592
make a hat with some fur around it,

454
00:28:40,669 --> 00:28:42,603
track,

455
00:28:42,671 --> 00:28:44,639
disappear,

456
00:28:44,706 --> 00:28:48,074
and know which plants not to touch,
so | don't stick myself and bleed to death.

457
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:50,737
(Cortina) Over the next several months,

458
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:55,613
the wise and wily mountain man
handed down the secrets of survival

459
00:28:55,684 --> 00:28:57,379
to his fervent pupil,

460
00:28:57,452 --> 00:29:01,446
much the way Moses
handed down the stone tablets.

461
00:29:01,523 --> 00:29:03,924
The Kid learned rapidly.

462
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:07,758
Nature to him became second nature

463
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:10,992
and the wilderness became his home.

464
00:29:11,066 --> 00:29:13,160
(donkey brays)

465
00:29:19,875 --> 00:29:21,274
(laughs)

466
00:29:24,446 --> 00:29:26,778
- | think you caught the last one.
- Oh.

467
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:28,942
Stupid fish!

468
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:31,577
- You're making me mad now.
- What's that?

469
00:29:31,653 --> 00:29:35,089
This fish said, "Hey, you are really stupid."

470
00:29:35,157 --> 00:29:37,148
(Otter Bob laughs)

471
00:29:40,796 --> 00:29:42,787
(Bob) Good.

472
00:29:46,702 --> 00:29:48,727
Good.

473
00:29:48,804 --> 00:29:50,795
You can kill a cup.

474
00:29:51,807 --> 00:29:53,798
Thanks, Bob.

475
00:29:57,379 --> 00:29:59,370
(Bob) Where'd you get that hat?

476
00:29:59,448 --> 00:30:01,815
It's my daddy's hat.

477
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:05,080
- That's a Cherokee feather.
- He was half Cherokee.

478
00:30:05,153 --> 00:30:09,613
And your daddy
was in many, many battles.

479
00:30:09,691 --> 00:30:12,854
He won 'em all.
You know how | know that?

480
00:30:12,928 --> 00:30:14,760
- You see all that on that feather?
- Yeah.

481
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:17,060
Those little marks here,
they're called "coos."

482
00:30:17,132 --> 00:30:20,500
And each coo is a battle
that your daddy won.

483
00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:24,305
Your daddy was a great warrior.

484
00:30:25,607 --> 00:30:27,006
That he was.

485
00:30:36,118 --> 00:30:38,712
Looks like we're getting close.

486
00:30:46,128 --> 00:30:50,292
OK, | got three bobcats here.
That's five apiece.

487
00:30:50,365 --> 00:30:52,891
- That's right.
- I got six otters.

488
00:30:52,968 --> 00:30:56,598
- That's four dollars apiece, right?
- Oh, yeah, four apiece.

489
00:30:56,671 --> 00:31:01,006
And | got one mountain lion,
ten dollars apiece.

490
00:31:01,076 --> 00:31:02,874
- You got a mountain lion?
- That's right.

491
00:31:02,944 --> 00:31:04,844
You good. You good.

492
00:31:06,181 --> 00:31:09,310
And one coyote.
Three dollars, right?

493
00:31:09,384 --> 00:31:12,752
Well, since it's you,
I'll give you three dollars for it.

494
00:31:12,821 --> 00:31:15,051
OK, what does that mean?
How much is that?

495
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:16,557
That's, uh...

496
00:31:16,625 --> 00:31:18,491
That's a lot, ain't it?

497
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:21,257
Carry that two, and...

498
00:31:21,329 --> 00:31:23,593
- Oh, Bob, you a rich man.
- Yeah.

499
00:31:23,665 --> 00:31:26,191
| owe you $26.

500
00:31:26,268 --> 00:31:28,737
No, sir, that's not $26.

501
00:31:28,804 --> 00:31:31,171
- That's $52.
- No, it's 26.

502
00:31:31,239 --> 00:31:34,504
No, sir, that's $52.

503
00:31:38,947 --> 00:31:41,644
C'mon, Bob, who you gonna believe?

504
00:31:41,716 --> 00:31:43,946
Me or him?

505
00:31:44,786 --> 00:31:46,515
Well...

506
00:31:46,588 --> 00:31:49,023
See, that young man's like a son to me.

507
00:31:49,091 --> 00:31:54,029
And you, you're a lyin',
cheatin' son of a bitch.

508
00:31:54,096 --> 00:31:58,124
C'mon, Bob.
I'm just doing business, I've been fair.

509
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,066
I'm gonna believe him!

510
00:32:00,135 --> 00:32:01,899
Oh!

511
00:32:03,105 --> 00:32:06,075
You've been doing it for five years.

512
00:32:06,141 --> 00:32:09,702
C'mon over here and get $52
and get that pigsticker out of him.

513
00:32:09,778 --> 00:32:12,270
- You killed him!
- | hope | did.

514
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:13,610
You k...

515
00:32:13,682 --> 00:32:19,985
I'll take a bottle of whiskey for every year
that son of a bitch cheated me.

516
00:32:20,055 --> 00:32:23,286
- That'll be five bottles.
- So, now we're stealing and killing?

517
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:24,519
Yeah.

518
00:32:27,863 --> 00:32:29,490
Euch.

519
00:32:29,564 --> 00:32:31,123
What the hell?

520
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:34,464
Look, this ain't what it look like.
He was cheating on us...

521
00:32:34,536 --> 00:32:38,166
Wait a minute! Hold on!
Bob, wait! Bob, wait!

522
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,368
(gunshot)

523
00:32:40,442 --> 00:32:42,274
Bob, Bob!

524
00:32:42,344 --> 00:32:44,506
Wait! Bob, slow down!

525
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:50,344
Will you brighten up a little bit?
Nobody gonna find us here.

526
00:32:50,418 --> 00:32:52,614
If they can't find us,
they're not gonna do us any harm.

527
00:32:52,687 --> 00:32:54,621
| ain't worried about nobody bothering us.

528
00:32:54,689 --> 00:32:57,556
I'm just wondering why
you trusted me today.

529
00:33:01,563 --> 00:33:05,591
Well, if a man can't trust
his own best friend,

530
00:33:05,667 --> 00:33:07,863
who can he trust?

531
00:33:09,037 --> 00:33:12,166
- You my best friend too, Bob.
- Yeah.

532
00:33:14,042 --> 00:33:16,204
| ain't never had a drink, Bob.

533
00:33:16,278 --> 00:33:19,578
Well, it's about time then, isn't it?

534
00:33:19,648 --> 00:33:24,552
- Will it help me eat this lizard?
- It'll take the stink right off that lizard.

535
00:33:24,619 --> 00:33:26,610
Don't give me too much.

536
00:33:28,957 --> 00:33:33,087
Yes, sir, you're gonna
love that lizard after this.

537
00:33:43,405 --> 00:33:46,067
Bob, this is nasty.

538
00:33:46,141 --> 00:33:48,838
This'll grow toenails on a dead man.

539
00:33:48,910 --> 00:33:50,708
I'm gonna have some more.

540
00:33:50,779 --> 00:33:55,182
This lizard reminds me
of how | killed my first bear.

541
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:56,877
You ain't killed no bear.

542
00:33:56,952 --> 00:34:00,354
You put it on a stick like we had it
and you put it over the fire.

543
00:34:00,422 --> 00:34:03,790
And they'll come sneaking up... (growls)

544
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:08,061
And then you jump right on their back -
they don't even know what's happening

545
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:10,188
'cause they're so crazy about that lizard.

546
00:34:10,265 --> 00:34:12,632
- And you got him around the neck!
- You was on his back?

547
00:34:12,701 --> 00:34:15,762
- And you're choking him and choking him.
- You was on his back?

548
00:34:15,837 --> 00:34:16,963
| was on his back!

549
00:34:17,038 --> 00:34:19,700
And | was choking him
and | was choking him...

550
00:34:19,774 --> 00:34:21,742
His eyeballs just went pop!

551
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:25,576
| mean they just popped right out,
so | took out my knife and went...

552
00:34:25,647 --> 00:34:28,412
And bam, he hit this old tree.

553
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:33,045
And | took the knife and then
| slit his throat, right like that.

554
00:34:33,121 --> 00:34:36,284
That's when | became a mountain man.

555
00:34:36,358 --> 00:34:41,455
You're not a mountain man until you have
killed your first bear with your bare hands.

556
00:34:41,529 --> 00:34:42,963
Hold this.

557
00:34:43,031 --> 00:34:48,561
If you can remember what | taught you,
then you will be a great bear-hunter.

558
00:34:48,637 --> 00:34:50,628
I'm gonna go get a bear.

559
00:34:53,708 --> 00:34:58,703
| have told you everything that | know,
how to do it, so | want you to...

560
00:35:02,017 --> 00:35:03,348
Isaiah!

561
00:35:05,487 --> 00:35:06,818
Isaiah!

562
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:10,924
Son, | was just jokin'!

563
00:35:12,427 --> 00:35:15,829
I didn't kill him just with my hands!

564
00:35:15,897 --> 00:35:17,490
| had a gun!

565
00:35:17,565 --> 00:35:19,624
Here you go, come here.

566
00:35:19,701 --> 00:35:21,795
Come here, bear.

567
00:35:22,637 --> 00:35:25,572
- | got a nice lizard!
- (birds squawk)

568
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:27,039
Don't you sneak up on me.

569
00:35:27,108 --> 00:35:31,477
Hey, bear, here | come!
| got a nice little lizard for you.

570
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:33,071
(growling)

571
00:35:33,148 --> 00:35:35,139
(Isaiah screams)

572
00:35:38,019 --> 00:35:40,420
(Isaiah) | got you! You got me!

573
00:35:46,061 --> 00:35:49,520
(laughing)

574
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,835
He's small, but he's mean.

575
00:35:56,604 --> 00:35:58,129
(laughing)

576
00:35:58,206 --> 00:36:01,506
C'mon over here and
have a drink, mountain man.

577
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:04,307
I'm a mountain man.

578
00:36:06,848 --> 00:36:10,648
So you're telling me that
he's hanging out with an old-timer?

579
00:36:10,719 --> 00:36:13,450
And you ain't gonna find him.

580
00:36:13,521 --> 00:36:17,890
Otter Bob's sly as a fox.
He's the best mountain man in Texas.

581
00:36:20,161 --> 00:36:22,459
He's the best mountain man?

582
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:23,998
Yeah?

583
00:36:24,065 --> 00:36:27,194
Well, I'm the best tracker in Texas.

584
00:36:37,779 --> 00:36:40,111
You OK, Bob?

585
00:36:48,957 --> 00:36:50,584
It's empty.
| already told you it's empty.

586
00:36:50,658 --> 00:36:53,320
You finished it off two days ago.

587
00:36:53,395 --> 00:36:54,954
Bob, will you just sit down?

588
00:36:55,029 --> 00:36:57,498
Billy, | told you not to drink any more!

589
00:36:57,565 --> 00:36:59,761
Shut up, Bob!

590
00:36:59,834 --> 00:37:01,359
- There's nobody...
- Shut up!

591
00:37:01,436 --> 00:37:04,269
I'll kill you, you son of a bitch!
I'll Kill you!

592
00:37:04,339 --> 00:37:06,103
Put the gun down.

593
00:37:06,174 --> 00:37:08,404
- I'll kill ya!
- Put the gun down.

594
00:37:09,511 --> 00:37:11,275
- Don't move, don't move.
- Bob.

595
00:37:11,346 --> 00:37:13,246
Snake.

596
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:15,544
Don't move.
| got it, don't move.

597
00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:16,917
- What snake?
- Right there.

598
00:37:16,985 --> 00:37:20,387
| see it, don't shoot it.
Let me get it. Don't shoot it.

599
00:37:20,455 --> 00:37:22,753
It's a twig snake.
| didn't see it at first.

600
00:37:22,824 --> 00:37:25,316
Got it underneath my foot, right...

601
00:37:26,094 --> 00:37:28,324
It's gone, it's OK now.

602
00:37:28,396 --> 00:37:30,626
You saved my life, just give me the gun.

603
00:37:30,698 --> 00:37:35,158
(Cortina) Totally unaware that Frank
Bonner was thundering toward them,

604
00:37:35,236 --> 00:37:39,867
the Kid and Ofter Bob slept
like little babies that night.

605
00:37:49,818 --> 00:37:51,445
Good morning, Bob.

606
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:55,421
- Snake.
- Bob, you're just hallucinating.

607
00:37:55,490 --> 00:37:57,686
Between your legs.

608
00:37:57,759 --> 00:38:00,194
You're just confused, all right?

609
00:38:00,261 --> 00:38:02,286
He's a biggun.

610
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:05,196
That's my pet snake.

611
00:38:06,034 --> 00:38:07,263
He's my friend.

612
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:10,595
- Gotta do it.
- Bob, no. Bob.

613
00:38:10,672 --> 00:38:12,902
Bob, no! Bob! God, no!

614
00:38:12,974 --> 00:38:14,965
Aaagh!

615
00:38:19,848 --> 00:38:21,475
(rattles)

616
00:38:28,223 --> 00:38:32,091
- Thank you.
- | feel pretty good about it myself.

617
00:38:50,678 --> 00:38:53,306
Mighty good sippin' whiskey.

618
00:38:53,381 --> 00:38:57,443
There's plenty more
where that came from, old-timer.

619
00:38:57,519 --> 00:38:59,510
Now, look...

620
00:39:00,488 --> 00:39:03,048
I've been tracking him for three months,

621
00:39:03,124 --> 00:39:06,856
so why don't you just tell me
where that nigger is?

622
00:39:06,928 --> 00:39:09,226
"Nigger."

623
00:39:09,297 --> 00:39:12,494
| always thought that was an ugly word,
almost as ugly as you are.

624
00:39:12,567 --> 00:39:14,558
(laughs)

625
00:39:23,511 --> 00:39:26,173
Don't you ever sass me, old man.

626
00:39:27,515 --> 00:39:29,506
Sorry.

627
00:39:29,584 --> 00:39:31,348
I'm getting...

628
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:34,951
sassy in my old age.

629
00:39:36,991 --> 00:39:39,585
If | could have one more drink...

630
00:39:40,595 --> 00:39:44,657
| believe | can give you
the exact place where he's at.

631
00:39:44,732 --> 00:39:47,895
Can | look at that picture one more time?

632
00:40:03,017 --> 00:40:04,382
Gol

633
00:40:06,187 --> 00:40:08,884
Go, Isaiah!

634
00:40:24,372 --> 00:40:27,034
Aw, damn!

635
00:40:42,023 --> 00:40:44,117
- (trap slams shut)
- Agh!

636
00:40:44,192 --> 00:40:45,318
(gunshot)

637
00:40:45,393 --> 00:40:47,088
Agh!

638
00:40:47,161 --> 00:40:49,220
Agh! Oh, God!

639
00:40:49,297 --> 00:40:54,098
- Another day.
- Oh, God! Oh, God...

640
00:40:54,168 --> 00:40:56,330
Bob, you all right? Bob!

641
00:40:56,404 --> 00:40:58,429
No, I've been shot.

642
00:40:58,506 --> 00:41:00,907
Listen, if you're gonna put me on a horse,

643
00:41:00,975 --> 00:41:03,967
you put me on a whiskey horse, OK?

644
00:41:04,045 --> 00:41:06,013
Put me on a whiskey horse.

645
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:08,344
- On a whiskey horse, one with a keg.
- | know, | heard you.

646
00:41:08,416 --> 00:41:11,044
Argh!

647
00:41:12,186 --> 00:41:14,177
(gasping)

648
00:41:17,125 --> 00:41:20,584
I must tell you...
| gotta say my last words.

649
00:41:20,662 --> 00:41:25,031
Now, don't interrupt me. You just shut up
now, OK? These are my last words.

650
00:41:25,099 --> 00:41:27,295
| done stopped most of the bleeding.
You're gonna be all right.

651
00:41:27,368 --> 00:41:31,498
The most important words
I'm gonna say in my life...

652
00:41:36,778 --> 00:41:38,746
Bob?

653
00:41:38,813 --> 00:41:42,545
C'mon, Bob.

654
00:41:42,617 --> 00:41:44,608
Bob, Bob!

655
00:41:44,686 --> 00:41:46,381
- Bob!
- What?

656
00:41:46,454 --> 00:41:48,718
Oh, no.

657
00:41:48,790 --> 00:41:51,384
The last word they'll remember me by...

658
00:41:51,459 --> 00:41:56,829
The last thing they're gonna remember me
ever saying is, "What?"

659
00:41:58,066 --> 00:42:00,057
Bob.

660
00:42:31,399 --> 00:42:34,767
Now, | know you don't wanna
go to heaven sober...

661
00:42:34,836 --> 00:42:36,930
so here's one for the road.

662
00:42:40,108 --> 00:42:46,070
(Cortina) And so... as dear old Otter Bob
was winging his way to the Great Beyond,

663
00:42:46,147 --> 00:42:49,208
the Kid renewed his noble quest.

664
00:42:49,283 --> 00:42:54,084
It was then, one fortuitous day,
that the saints in heaven led our hero

665
00:42:54,155 --> 00:42:58,786
to the noblest, most proud
and good-looking caballero

666
00:42:58,860 --> 00:43:01,761
ever o lead the Mexican people
into battle.

667
00:43:02,063 --> 00:43:04,998
(Cortina) You think | am afraid of you?

668
00:43:06,901 --> 00:43:08,926
| spit on you.

669
00:43:09,637 --> 00:43:11,628
I am tired of you!

670
00:43:12,507 --> 00:43:14,566
Just wait, too close!

671
00:43:14,642 --> 00:43:19,478
| had a better conversation
with a tumbleweed!

672
00:43:22,550 --> 00:43:24,780
| spit on you!

673
00:43:26,487 --> 00:43:28,581
That's my hat!

674
00:43:29,991 --> 00:43:35,157
You should go home to your papa,
and get a whipping for having no brain!

675
00:43:36,197 --> 00:43:38,188
Ahh!

676
00:43:41,669 --> 00:43:43,967
Buenos dias.

677
00:43:48,943 --> 00:43:51,173
This mud should heal your face right up.

678
00:43:51,245 --> 00:43:53,612
In three or four days,
you'll be good as new.

679
00:43:54,282 --> 00:43:56,580
Sefior,

680
00:43:56,651 --> 00:44:01,714
you have saved the life
of a great Mexican patriot,

681
00:44:01,789 --> 00:44:04,690
Juan Nepomuceno Cortina,

682
00:44:05,459 --> 00:44:09,794
the man who time and again
outsmarted the Texas Rangers.

683
00:44:09,864 --> 00:44:11,662
That's good, now try and relax.

684
00:44:11,732 --> 00:44:15,327
The man who fearlessly occupied
the city of Brownsville.

685
00:44:15,403 --> 00:44:16,700
Trust me, you wanna relax.

686
00:44:16,771 --> 00:44:20,435
Cortina, the man who vowed
to sacrifice his own happiness...

687
00:44:20,508 --> 00:44:22,272
- Cortinal
- Si, sefior!

688
00:44:22,343 --> 00:44:25,904
If you don't stop yammerin', this medicine
ain't gonna work and you're gonna die.

689
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:27,971
OK...

690
00:44:29,617 --> 00:44:35,317
I am a proud and noble descendant
of Aztec and Spanish priests!

691
00:44:36,490 --> 00:44:38,515
Priests who taught the world
how to torture a man!

692
00:44:38,593 --> 00:44:40,083
Shh! Cortina!

693
00:44:41,629 --> 00:44:43,427
Why do you think I'm out here?

694
00:44:43,497 --> 00:44:46,592
In this hideout with all the trees
SO NO one can see me?

695
00:44:46,667 --> 00:44:50,661
Because I'm in a little trouble with the law
and | just don't want them to find me!

696
00:44:50,738 --> 00:44:52,399
| knew it.

697
00:44:52,473 --> 00:44:54,840
The first time | look in your eyes, | knew.

698
00:44:54,909 --> 00:44:57,310
You are a fellow freedom fighter.

699
00:44:57,378 --> 00:44:58,209
No.

700
00:44:58,279 --> 00:45:00,714
- Liberacién, ;no?
- No.

701
00:45:00,781 --> 00:45:03,216
But you understand my passion, no?

702
00:45:03,284 --> 00:45:04,376
No.

703
00:45:07,622 --> 00:45:09,920
You're the quiet warrior.

704
00:45:09,991 --> 00:45:13,222
No, | am not quiet, I'm tired.

705
00:45:13,294 --> 00:45:14,523
Tired.

706
00:45:17,064 --> 00:45:18,793
| am tired too, senor.

707
00:45:20,735 --> 00:45:24,968
Tired of the gringos
stealing the Mexican lands

708
00:45:25,039 --> 00:45:27,940
with the Mexican names
from the Mexican people!

709
00:45:28,009 --> 00:45:31,070
San Antonio, Amarillo,
El Paso, Corpus Christi!

710
00:45:31,145 --> 00:45:34,308
Oh. "Corpus Christi is Latin," you say.

711
00:45:34,382 --> 00:45:36,578
- | say nothing.
- Oh, no, it's OK.

712
00:45:36,651 --> 00:45:40,019
Did you ever think
Mexico is nothing to me?

713
00:45:42,590 --> 00:45:44,524
Yoo-hoo, sefior.

714
00:45:44,592 --> 00:45:47,220
What is your name, sefior?

715
00:45:47,295 --> 00:45:48,091
Bob.

716
00:45:48,162 --> 00:45:49,994
Bab?

717
00:45:51,732 --> 00:45:55,293
A small but fine name.
Sefior Bab.

718
00:45:55,369 --> 00:45:56,803
Bob.

719
00:45:58,706 --> 00:46:00,902
- Bab.
- Bob.

720
00:46:01,776 --> 00:46:02,971
Bob.

721
00:46:03,044 --> 00:46:07,277
Bob. Oh, Bob. Claro, ;cémo no?
That is different.

722
00:46:08,149 --> 00:46:10,311
You realize, sefior Bob...

723
00:46:11,686 --> 00:46:16,681
you have saved the life of the hero
of the Mexican people, Juan...

724
00:46:16,757 --> 00:46:18,816
- | got that part.
- OK.

725
00:46:19,593 --> 00:46:24,759
As a man of honor,
| must now repay that enormous debt.

726
00:46:24,832 --> 00:46:29,292
| tell you what, you go to sleep,
we'll call it even, all right?

727
00:46:29,370 --> 00:46:34,433
No, no, no, no, no.
1, Juan Nepomuceno Cortina,

728
00:46:34,508 --> 00:46:38,342
hereby vow to follow
and protect sefior Bob

729
00:46:38,412 --> 00:46:42,940
until such time as | in turn
can save the life of sefior Bob.

730
00:46:43,017 --> 00:46:45,111
- Did you say, "follow me"?
- Follow.

731
00:46:45,186 --> 00:46:48,588
No. No, no, no, no, no!

732
00:46:48,656 --> 00:46:51,057
You will not follow me anywhere,
do you understand me?

733
00:46:51,125 --> 00:46:55,722
(Cortina) And so, recognizing
the greatness each of us possessed,

734
00:46:55,796 --> 00:46:59,460
my friend and | were
inseparable from that day on.

735
00:46:59,533 --> 00:47:02,025
Together, side by side,

736
00:47:02,103 --> 00:47:05,869
we rode bravely toward
the most wicked and godless town

737
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:08,272
in all the American West,

738
00:47:08,342 --> 00:47:11,835
the very gateway to hell itself,

739
00:47:11,912 --> 00:47:14,506
El Paso, Mexico.

740
00:47:18,753 --> 00:47:22,087
- Lookie here!
- Hello!

741
00:47:24,692 --> 00:47:27,093
(woman) Sweetie, hey!

742
00:47:31,766 --> 00:47:35,669
- (bartender) What can | get you?
- (Isaiah) Give me a whiskey.

743
00:47:35,736 --> 00:47:37,033
Permiso, sefior.

744
00:47:37,104 --> 00:47:41,439
| want to try to play some cards
with these cowboys.

745
00:47:41,509 --> 00:47:43,841
OK.

746
00:47:51,318 --> 00:47:53,980
What is this?
That ain't whiskey.

747
00:47:54,055 --> 00:47:56,717
(bartender) That's El Paso's best, sir.

748
00:47:57,324 --> 00:47:59,418
That'll be a dollar, partner.

749
00:47:59,493 --> 00:48:03,020
I'm not your partner... and I'm not
gonna give you a dollar for this drink.

750
00:48:03,097 --> 00:48:04,997
I'll settle for 25 cents.

751
00:48:05,066 --> 00:48:10,232
Sample, if you will, the wonders
of this amazing new scientific invention,

752
00:48:10,304 --> 00:48:15,470
the brushing instrument for human teeth
and dental plates.

753
00:48:15,543 --> 00:48:18,444
It expunges odor, eliminates decay,

754
00:48:18,512 --> 00:48:21,174
eradicates bleeding gums and mouth pain.

755
00:48:21,248 --> 00:48:25,185
All the rage in London, Paris,
New York and Cairo,

756
00:48:25,252 --> 00:48:28,745
and yours, my friends, for only 25 cents.

757
00:48:28,823 --> 00:48:32,885
- 25 cents! Any takers?
- | gotta have one of those.

758
00:48:33,894 --> 00:48:35,885
Help yourself.

759
00:48:39,433 --> 00:48:42,698
Excuse me, 25 cents.

760
00:48:42,770 --> 00:48:45,933
- Hey, ladies, please!
- Hey, give me one!

761
00:48:47,308 --> 00:48:48,935
OK, one more.

762
00:48:50,945 --> 00:48:52,470
Psst, psst.

763
00:48:52,546 --> 00:48:54,537
Psst.

764
00:49:24,912 --> 00:49:26,607
That's a mighty nice...

765
00:49:28,349 --> 00:49:32,081
That's a mighty fine
brushing instrument, ma'am.

766
00:49:32,153 --> 00:49:34,087
You too, cowpoke.

767
00:49:34,155 --> 00:49:37,216
Lookie who's caught in my little trap.

768
00:49:40,294 --> 00:49:42,888
(man) Party's over there, kids.

769
00:49:43,764 --> 00:49:46,665
(man #1) C'mon, nice and easy.

770
00:49:59,613 --> 00:50:02,241
Hey, stranger, you mighty quiet.

771
00:50:02,316 --> 00:50:06,253
If you weren't breathing,
I'd think you was dead.

772
00:50:07,188 --> 00:50:09,520
Name's Isaiah Turner.

773
00:50:14,094 --> 00:50:16,222
I'll be doggone!

774
00:50:16,297 --> 00:50:18,959
You're Nat Love, ain't you?

775
00:50:19,033 --> 00:50:23,061
Well, Mr. Love, it is a privilege
to share the same jail cell with you, sir.

776
00:50:23,137 --> 00:50:25,105
| read all your books.
As a matter of fact,

777
00:50:25,172 --> 00:50:27,971
| used to read it to the kids
at the church where | taught.

778
00:50:28,042 --> 00:50:31,137
You the baddest gunslinger that ever lived.

779
00:50:31,212 --> 00:50:32,805
Is all that stuff true?

780
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:36,544
Did you really corral ten men by yourself
at the Rattlesnake Canyon?

781
00:50:36,617 --> 00:50:40,076
- Been in a lot of canyons.
- And you robbed a bank with just a knife?

782
00:50:40,154 --> 00:50:42,213
That's what they say.

783
00:50:42,289 --> 00:50:44,553
You're just the man to teach me
what | need to know.

784
00:50:44,625 --> 00:50:49,392
I've been huntin' some men down.
| need to work on my gunslingin' skills.

785
00:50:49,463 --> 00:50:51,727
Sit back.

786
00:50:51,799 --> 00:50:53,995
Enjoy the day.

787
00:50:54,068 --> 00:50:56,196
Ain't got time to teach you nothing.

788
00:50:56,270 --> 00:50:58,762
They're gonna hang me tomorrow.

789
00:50:58,839 --> 00:51:00,273
Well, look at you.

790
00:51:00,341 --> 00:51:02,139
You about to be hung and...

791
00:51:02,209 --> 00:51:05,611
you sitting there like you going
to the barber to get a haircut.

792
00:51:05,679 --> 00:51:10,583
If a man can't go out in a blaze of glory,
he can at least go with dignity.

793
00:51:11,452 --> 00:51:13,352
| don't feel like goin'.

794
00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:16,685
(sheriff) Morning, Mr. Bloomington!
Look alive, everybody!

795
00:51:16,757 --> 00:51:18,748
Well, well, well.

796
00:51:19,627 --> 00:51:22,619
Looks like you've earned yourself a name.

797
00:51:22,696 --> 00:51:24,892
"The Whorehouse Kid."

798
00:51:24,965 --> 00:51:28,162
- By God, that's a quaint little moniker.
- Look at you,

799
00:51:28,235 --> 00:51:31,034
all famous and fancy and legit now.

800
00:51:31,105 --> 00:51:35,440
You've become quite a little irritant
to me, son. But, as mayor of this...

801
00:51:35,509 --> 00:51:37,136
Talkin' like butter won't melt in your mouth.

802
00:51:37,211 --> 00:51:39,737
As mayor of this fair city,

803
00:51:39,813 --> 00:51:42,043
I've come to tell you that
you're going to get a fair trial.

804
00:51:42,116 --> 00:51:45,814
- 'Cept for, | know what you really are.
- And a fair hanging.

805
00:51:45,886 --> 00:51:48,446
- A thief and a murderer.
- Goddamn it!

806
00:51:49,189 --> 00:51:51,624
I'm gonna kill you, Bloomington.

807
00:51:52,626 --> 00:51:57,530
You are going to get yours tomorrow... boy.

808
00:51:58,999 --> 00:52:03,061
And | can't wait to see them
slip that noose around your neck,

809
00:52:03,137 --> 00:52:06,232
and that look of pure terror
come over your face,

810
00:52:06,307 --> 00:52:09,368
just like your mama had
that night that | shot her.

811
00:52:09,877 --> 00:52:13,006
I'm gonna come back from my grave
and I'm gonna kill you.

812
00:52:13,947 --> 00:52:15,938
(chuckles)

813
00:52:21,689 --> 00:52:25,182
If my brother Jedediah was here he'd come
through that door with his guns a-blazin'

814
00:52:25,259 --> 00:52:28,422
- and he'd break us outta here.
- Jedediah?

815
00:52:28,495 --> 00:52:30,964
- Turner?
- You know him?

816
00:52:32,199 --> 00:52:34,531
- Your brother?
- Yeah.

817
00:52:34,601 --> 00:52:36,228
He was a good man.

818
00:52:36,303 --> 00:52:38,567
Hell of a gunfighter.

819
00:52:38,639 --> 00:52:43,440
Had a classic showdown with another gun,
called himself "the Undertaker."

820
00:52:43,510 --> 00:52:45,501
Jedediah took him, didn't he?

821
00:52:45,579 --> 00:52:48,207
| know he's a great gunslinger now.
He always was good!

822
00:52:48,282 --> 00:52:51,980
They say it was close.
One for the books.

823
00:52:52,052 --> 00:52:54,043
But your brother lost.

824
00:52:56,623 --> 00:52:59,092
Jedediah dead?

825
00:53:04,064 --> 00:53:06,055
He killed my brother?

826
00:53:17,244 --> 00:53:21,477
You tell me where I'll find this dog called
"the Undertaker," 'cause I'm gonna kill him.

827
00:53:21,548 --> 00:53:25,507
No, first I'm gonna kill Bloomington,
then I'm gonna kill Bonner,

828
00:53:25,586 --> 00:53:28,146
then I'm gonna put a bullet in the head
of this man called "the Undertaker."

829
00:53:28,222 --> 00:53:31,123
That's a whole heap of folks to kill.

830
00:53:32,092 --> 00:53:34,652
For a man who ain't got no gun,

831
00:53:34,728 --> 00:53:36,389
can't shoot,

832
00:53:36,463 --> 00:53:39,364
and is presently incarcerated.

833
00:53:44,471 --> 00:53:46,963
Well, I'm gonna shoot him dead.

834
00:53:47,708 --> 00:53:49,699
(snoring)

835
00:53:57,718 --> 00:54:00,551
(Cortina) Psst, psst!

836
00:54:01,722 --> 00:54:03,656
(Cortina) Bob!

837
00:54:03,724 --> 00:54:05,920
- Cortina?
- Psst.

838
00:54:06,927 --> 00:54:08,622
- Psst, psst.
- Cortina.

839
00:54:08,695 --> 00:54:10,754
- Psst.
- Help.

840
00:54:10,831 --> 00:54:12,356
- They'll hang me.
- Wonderful!

841
00:54:12,433 --> 00:54:16,961
| was hoping. So I'm saving your life, right?
We'll be even, | owe you nothing, right?

842
00:54:17,037 --> 00:54:19,062
- Right.
- OK, you got it.

843
00:54:19,573 --> 00:54:21,337
Come on, Nat, wake up.

844
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:28,774
Ox, jya!

845
00:54:35,823 --> 00:54:36,756
C'mon.

846
00:54:36,824 --> 00:54:39,987
- (Isaiah) This is my friend, Nat Love.
- (Cortina) Good to meet you, Nat Love.

847
00:54:40,060 --> 00:54:42,290
Here's your horse, here's your gun.
Even-steven, OK?

848
00:54:42,362 --> 00:54:44,330
- It was good riding with you, Bob.
- You too.

849
00:54:44,398 --> 00:54:47,095
| got to go save the Mexican people.

850
00:54:51,371 --> 00:54:53,362
- You saved my life again!
- 1 did not!

851
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:54,669
- Yes, you did.
- He jumped out the window.

852
00:54:54,741 --> 00:54:56,607
- He was killing me!
- He was not!

853
00:54:56,677 --> 00:55:01,046
Every time | turn around you save my life!
You make me absolutely crazy!

854
00:55:01,114 --> 00:55:03,674
- Nat, I'm goin' with you.
- The hell you are. | ride alone.

855
00:55:03,750 --> 00:55:05,616
Nat, that's my horse!

856
00:55:05,686 --> 00:55:07,984
- | gotta go with you.
- What?

857
00:55:08,055 --> 00:55:10,956
C'mon. Let's go!

858
00:55:11,024 --> 00:55:12,253
Help me get up!

859
00:55:12,326 --> 00:55:14,988
(Cortina) Pursued by 20 Texas Rangers,

860
00:55:15,062 --> 00:55:18,464
with a pack of slavering bloodhounds
nipping at our heels,

861
00:55:18,532 --> 00:55:20,261
we rode fogether,

862
00:55:20,334 --> 00:55:23,599
escorting sefior Love
to his secret hideaway.

863
00:55:23,670 --> 00:55:26,298
Senor Love! Senor!

864
00:55:28,408 --> 00:55:30,399
(Isaiah) Hey, I'm not playing with you!

865
00:55:31,612 --> 00:55:34,377
(men) Nat! Nat!

866
00:55:34,448 --> 00:55:36,940
| thought you were dead, boy!
How you doin'?

867
00:55:37,017 --> 00:55:40,248
Yeah, well, they almost
stretched my neck for real this time, boys.

868
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:43,312
(man) How the hell are you, Nat?

869
00:55:43,390 --> 00:55:46,155
Hey, don't shoot, don't shoot!

870
00:55:46,226 --> 00:55:48,490
It is |, Juan Nepomuceno Cortina.

871
00:55:48,562 --> 00:55:50,394
| springed you from
the hoosegow back there!

872
00:55:50,464 --> 00:55:53,456
- Where's the kid?
- The kid? The kid...

873
00:55:53,534 --> 00:55:57,528
He keeps falling off the back of my horse.
It's a little problem we are working on.

874
00:55:57,871 --> 00:55:59,032
No, don't you do it!

875
00:55:59,106 --> 00:56:04,840
What part of, "Stop, wait, I've fallen down,
wait for me" do you not understand?

876
00:56:04,912 --> 00:56:07,142
He was riding like the wind.
| had to catch up with him.

877
00:56:07,214 --> 00:56:11,947
- You left me back there in the dirt!
- | did not want to leave sefior Love.

878
00:56:12,019 --> 00:56:15,683
Gentlemen, allow me to introduce
my fearless compadre,

879
00:56:15,756 --> 00:56:18,623
Senor "Isaiah” Bob Turner.

880
00:56:19,059 --> 00:56:21,960
Now, look, | thought | told you
not to follow me!

881
00:56:22,462 --> 00:56:24,897
| know... but | had to.

882
00:56:24,965 --> 00:56:27,195
| need your help.
Plus, you stole my horse.

883
00:56:27,267 --> 00:56:30,259
| ain't got time to be helpin' you.
Now go on, get on outta here!

884
00:56:30,337 --> 00:56:32,806
C'mon, Nat, | saved your life.

885
00:56:33,473 --> 00:56:35,532
That's right, you owe your life to this man.

886
00:56:35,609 --> 00:56:39,068
You must protect this man.
You must follow him and give him shelter

887
00:56:39,146 --> 00:56:41,376
until such time as you can
save the life of this man.

888
00:56:41,448 --> 00:56:43,712
- Shut up.
- Shut up.

889
00:56:43,784 --> 00:56:46,310
All right, you can hole up
for a couple of days.

890
00:56:46,386 --> 00:56:48,354
As long as that fella keeps his trap shut.

891
00:56:48,422 --> 00:56:50,447
Keep your mouth shut.

892
00:56:50,524 --> 00:56:52,515
Come on.

893
00:56:55,696 --> 00:56:57,630
Don't you get mad at me
'cause you can't stay on the horse!

894
00:56:57,698 --> 00:57:00,099
| can't stay on the horse when you
ride the horse with your big sombrero.

895
00:57:00,167 --> 00:57:05,469
| can't see nothin' with your big sombrero!
It kept hitting me in my eye!

896
00:57:06,940 --> 00:57:08,965
Whoal!

897
00:57:12,245 --> 00:57:14,236
- Who are you?
- Isaiah.

898
00:57:15,182 --> 00:57:16,707
Who are they?

899
00:57:16,783 --> 00:57:18,911
- Special people.
- How you doin', Sister?

900
00:57:18,986 --> 00:57:20,818
| got a whole lot of
special people around here.

901
00:57:20,887 --> 00:57:22,651
How you doin’, Sister?

902
00:57:22,723 --> 00:57:25,886
Hello, Sister. Sister.

903
00:57:25,959 --> 00:57:27,950
Let me give you a hand.

904
00:57:30,330 --> 00:57:32,890
(laughs)

905
00:57:32,966 --> 00:57:35,992
You look like a man.
You smell like a man, too.

906
00:57:42,976 --> 00:57:43,909
Amen.

907
00:57:43,977 --> 00:57:46,309
(man) Dig in, boys.

908
00:57:52,152 --> 00:57:55,087
Um... my name's Isaiah Turner.

909
00:57:55,155 --> 00:57:58,352
This is a really nice hideout you got here.

910
00:57:58,425 --> 00:58:00,757
How ya doin'? | haven't met...

911
00:58:00,827 --> 00:58:04,195
OK. You guys are pretty hungry.

912
00:58:04,264 --> 00:58:08,258
I'm new at gunslinging, so any kind of tips
or pointers you could show me,

913
00:58:08,335 --> 00:58:12,636
I'd be willing to... take into consideration.

914
00:58:17,844 --> 00:58:19,209
Hey!

915
00:58:21,515 --> 00:58:23,244
Use a damn fork, Graham.

916
00:58:25,786 --> 00:58:27,777
(laughter)

917
00:58:38,465 --> 00:58:40,593
(man) He can't hit nothing.

918
00:58:42,135 --> 00:58:43,603
(yells)

919
00:58:43,670 --> 00:58:45,365
(man) Try again!

920
00:59:01,054 --> 00:59:03,489
Bob, no! No, Bob!

921
00:59:03,557 --> 00:59:04,649
No, no, no!

922
00:59:04,725 --> 00:59:06,250
No me mate!
No quick draw.

923
00:59:06,326 --> 00:59:10,888
We either gonna have to kill that kid,
or teach him how to shoot.

924
00:59:10,964 --> 00:59:13,262
We don't get shot at this much
when we're robbin' banks.

925
00:59:15,802 --> 00:59:17,770
Shoot this.

926
00:59:17,838 --> 00:59:20,170
All right, put it down on the rock.

927
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:23,801
No. Shoot it out of my hand.

928
00:59:24,578 --> 00:59:26,979
- C'mon, Nat.
- Shoot it.

929
00:59:32,519 --> 00:59:35,386
If you hit me... I'm gonna kill ya.

930
00:59:36,056 --> 00:59:39,287
Nat, this ain't funny, c'mon.

931
00:59:41,962 --> 00:59:43,953
Shoot it.

932
01:00:02,315 --> 01:00:06,479
Every time you shoot at someone,
plan on dying.

933
01:00:08,288 --> 01:00:10,120
Al right.

934
01:00:19,466 --> 01:00:22,834
(woman) C'mon, Nat, get up on that horse!

935
01:00:22,903 --> 01:00:25,929
(cheering)

936
01:00:26,006 --> 01:00:28,338
Whoal!

937
01:00:28,408 --> 01:00:30,570
Wooo!

938
01:00:30,644 --> 01:00:32,635
(Isaiah) That was great!

939
01:00:35,215 --> 01:00:36,808
That's how I wanna ride.

940
01:00:36,883 --> 01:00:38,874
You need to be confident, Bob.

941
01:00:39,186 --> 01:00:42,315
- The problem is getting up onto the horse.
- That's hard.

942
01:00:42,389 --> 01:00:43,754
Yes.

943
01:00:43,824 --> 01:00:48,523
OK, let's try it again.
Put the foot in the stirrup, OK?

944
01:00:49,496 --> 01:00:52,124
Just remember,
no fighting in the bank.

945
01:00:52,199 --> 01:00:53,496
This hand gets the reigns.

946
01:00:53,567 --> 01:00:56,537
You don't have the reigns,
you have no control.

947
01:00:56,603 --> 01:00:58,435
You ready?
You go up, OK?

948
01:00:58,505 --> 01:01:02,464
- | like when you don't holler at me.
- I'm so sorry | hollered at you.

949
01:01:02,542 --> 01:01:04,306
OK? One, two, three, hup.

950
01:01:09,850 --> 01:01:11,716
- Looks pretty good, don't it?
- It looks good, yeah.

951
01:01:11,785 --> 01:01:15,221
- (Nat) Hey, get off that horse.
- | just got on it.

952
01:01:18,391 --> 01:01:20,155
He's jealous.

953
01:01:26,199 --> 01:01:29,692
You know, ridin' a horse
is a lot like being with a woman.

954
01:01:29,769 --> 01:01:31,760
Ah!

955
01:01:35,575 --> 01:01:38,476
OK, just so | understand this correctly,

956
01:01:38,545 --> 01:01:41,412
what part of ridin' a horse
is like being with a woman?

957
01:01:41,481 --> 01:01:43,711
Nat, the greenhorn's a virgin!

958
01:01:43,783 --> 01:01:46,252
| am not!
| am not a virgin!

959
01:01:46,319 --> 01:01:48,515
(man) Boy ain't never had
no sugar dumplings!

960
01:01:48,588 --> 01:01:50,682
- (laughter and applause)
- Oh, don't clap for me!

961
01:01:50,757 --> 01:01:56,025
If you knew how many women | been with,
y'all would be in there prayin' right now!

962
01:01:56,096 --> 01:01:59,657
Boy ain't nothin' but a cherry,
that's what he is!

963
01:01:59,733 --> 01:02:03,260
| been with so many women,
| can't remember all their names!

964
01:02:03,336 --> 01:02:05,168
(whistles)

965
01:02:05,238 --> 01:02:09,266
It's all right.
Mary got the medicine for ya.

966
01:02:09,342 --> 01:02:12,972
- | don't need your help.
- C'mon, now, Mary ain't gonna hurt ya.

967
01:02:13,046 --> 01:02:15,276
- Just give you a little ridin' lesson.
- Get away from me.

968
01:02:15,348 --> 01:02:18,409
Come here, boy! Come here!

969
01:02:18,485 --> 01:02:21,079
Go ahead, Mary, show him!

970
01:02:21,688 --> 01:02:22,985
(man) Show him, show him!

971
01:02:23,056 --> 01:02:25,320
Ow! Owl

972
01:02:25,392 --> 01:02:28,020
- Don't hurt me, Mary!
- Mary ain't gonna hurt you.

973
01:02:28,094 --> 01:02:31,758
- Mary's gonna fix what troubles you.
- Nat!

974
01:02:32,499 --> 01:02:34,126
- Good luck, Bob!
- (bleating)

975
01:02:36,336 --> 01:02:38,065
(laughing)

976
01:02:38,138 --> 01:02:40,300
(Isaiah) Nat, she ain't got no drawers!

977
01:02:57,757 --> 01:02:58,918
(man) Whoo!

978
01:03:00,226 --> 01:03:03,093
(man) Yeah! Ride him, cowboy!

979
01:03:04,397 --> 01:03:06,263
(man) All right!

980
01:03:06,333 --> 01:03:08,267
(man) He's a bronc rider!

981
01:03:08,335 --> 01:03:10,633
I'd say the boy's fixed.

982
01:03:31,891 --> 01:03:34,360
He's been practicing.

983
01:03:35,028 --> 01:03:41,024
I tell her, "Maria, drink this tequila,
take off your clothes."

984
01:03:41,101 --> 01:03:43,001
"You will see God!"

985
01:03:43,069 --> 01:03:45,060
"I will bring him to you!"

986
01:03:46,373 --> 01:03:49,365
Boys, now come on,
why did you call us here?

987
01:03:49,442 --> 01:03:51,877
The kid needs a name.

988
01:03:53,213 --> 01:03:56,046
How 'bout "Dusty Butt"?

989
01:03:57,617 --> 01:04:00,086
He's still wet behind the ears.

990
01:04:00,153 --> 01:04:03,179
- Let's call him "Runt Boy."
- Oh, uh-uh, honey.

991
01:04:03,256 --> 01:04:07,386
- Ain't nothin' runty about that boy.
- (laughter)

992
01:04:07,460 --> 01:04:10,157
| broke him, | say / should name him.

993
01:04:10,230 --> 01:04:13,689
- (man) How's about "Happy"?
- It's about pride.

994
01:04:13,767 --> 01:04:17,067
Man's gotta have a name
that he can be proud of.

995
01:04:17,137 --> 01:04:19,868
You know?
What are you proud of, son?

996
01:04:21,274 --> 01:04:23,003
My daddy.

997
01:04:23,076 --> 01:04:25,545
He died fighting for
something he believed in.

998
01:04:25,612 --> 01:04:28,138
- He was half Cherokee.
- "The Cherokee Kid."

999
01:04:28,214 --> 01:04:30,683
Oh, wait now, I've got it. "Buffalo Red."

1000
01:04:30,750 --> 01:04:33,082
- "Buffalo Bob."
- Not "Bob."

1001
01:04:33,153 --> 01:04:35,645
- His name is not Bob.
- No, listen to me...

1002
01:04:35,722 --> 01:04:37,884
What about "Rusty Red"?

1003
01:04:38,958 --> 01:04:43,020
- "Cherokee Kid."
- Ah-ah-ah...!

1004
01:04:43,096 --> 01:04:45,758
| got it.

1005
01:04:47,801 --> 01:04:52,068
- "The Cherokee Kid."
- All right, Nat, now that's a name.

1006
01:04:52,138 --> 01:04:55,597
That's a good one, Nat.
"The Cherokee Kid."

1007
01:05:00,613 --> 01:05:06,211
- Well, do | look like a gunslinger?
- You look like the Cherokee Kid.

1008
01:05:06,286 --> 01:05:09,381
I've been meaning to ask you...

1009
01:05:09,456 --> 01:05:12,050
- Where did the shirt come from?
- That's Billy's.

1010
01:05:12,125 --> 01:05:14,992
He's not with us anymore.

1011
01:05:17,997 --> 01:05:21,456
- Where we headed, Nat?
- Reserve bank in Pecos.

1012
01:05:21,534 --> 01:05:24,799
It's Bloomington's
biggest bank, easy target.

1013
01:05:25,238 --> 01:05:26,797
Let's move it!

1014
01:05:53,766 --> 01:05:56,030
Those are the charges and the amount.

1015
01:05:56,102 --> 01:05:58,696
- Hold on, sir.
- | want that amount...

1016
01:05:58,771 --> 01:06:00,967
Could | please have
some money for the poor?

1017
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:05,136
- Sorry, Sister.
- Pretty please. It's for charity, you know.

1018
01:06:05,211 --> 01:06:07,873
- No can do.
- Oh.

1019
01:06:07,947 --> 01:06:10,917
How about if | show you a little of this?

1020
01:06:10,984 --> 01:06:13,885
Anybody move, I'll blow ya straight to hell.

1021
01:06:14,854 --> 01:06:16,845
Pay attention.

1022
01:06:22,061 --> 01:06:24,723
Let's move it, ladies!

1023
01:06:45,051 --> 01:06:47,042
(Mary) Get! Ho!

1024
01:06:48,087 --> 01:06:50,385
Go on now!

1025
01:06:53,693 --> 01:06:56,993
We've just been robbed
by a bunch of gun-totin' nuns

1026
01:06:57,063 --> 01:06:58,861
and that man!

1027
01:07:16,649 --> 01:07:19,243
Whoa, whoa.

1028
01:07:23,756 --> 01:07:25,520
Phew! That was fun.

1029
01:07:25,592 --> 01:07:28,926
You're the quickest
doggone study I've ever seen.

1030
01:07:28,995 --> 01:07:31,521
Well, you're the best teacher I've ever had.

1031
01:07:31,598 --> 01:07:34,090
You got places to go...

1032
01:07:34,167 --> 01:07:36,829
and people to kill.

1033
01:07:36,903 --> 01:07:41,101
- We'll meet up again sometime.
- Thanks, Nat. | ain't gonna forget you.

1034
01:07:41,507 --> 01:07:42,633
C'm
on!

1035
01:07:45,445 --> 01:07:49,348
(Cortina) That was the last time
| saw sefior Nat Love.

1036
01:07:49,415 --> 01:07:52,783
But he is a man of such character, such...

1037
01:07:53,786 --> 01:07:55,777
bearing, such...

1038
01:07:57,257 --> 01:07:58,486
cojones,

1039
01:07:59,726 --> 01:08:02,718
he will live within my bosom forever.

1040
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:10,800
(Cortina) The Kid knew
if Bloomington was elected governor

1041
01:08:10,870 --> 01:08:14,636
he would control everything:
the money, the land, the people.

1042
01:08:14,707 --> 01:08:17,472
Plus, it would be
a whole lot harder to kill him.

1043
01:08:17,543 --> 01:08:21,036
So he took the excellent advice
of yours truly

1044
01:08:21,114 --> 01:08:24,982
and set out to make Bloomington
crazy enough to come to him.

1045
01:08:25,051 --> 01:08:29,420
He realized robbing his banks would be
a nice way o get his attention

1046
01:08:29,489 --> 01:08:33,016
and to humiliate him
in the eyes of the public.

1047
01:08:34,927 --> 01:08:37,055
Excuse me,
we're taking a photograph here.

1048
01:08:37,130 --> 01:08:39,622
Oh, yeah?
We're robbin' a bank here.

1049
01:08:39,699 --> 01:08:42,066
Hey, take the picture!

1050
01:08:46,339 --> 01:08:51,072
- Give me all your money, por favor.
- OK, just one minute. Mr. Kid?

1051
01:08:51,144 --> 01:08:53,135
The Cherokee Kid?

1052
01:08:54,280 --> 01:08:56,647
Hi. Hi.

1053
01:08:56,716 --> 01:08:58,377
- We're old friends.
- What are you doin' here?

1054
01:08:58,451 --> 01:09:00,510
Well, | got promoted, then transferred.

1055
01:09:00,586 --> 01:09:02,816
| got a new job, too.
| rob banks.

1056
01:09:04,257 --> 01:09:07,318
- Ta-da.
- You got the apron!

1057
01:09:08,127 --> 01:09:09,959
They gave me an apron.
It's got the hand embroidery.

1058
01:09:10,029 --> 01:09:13,795
It doesn't have your name,
but it has those lovely floral patterns.

1059
01:09:13,866 --> 01:09:15,630
Oh, here, wait.

1060
01:09:16,402 --> 01:09:18,632
Don't forget your money.

1061
01:09:18,705 --> 01:09:22,005
- Thanks for your patronage.
- Give me my gun.

1062
01:09:23,543 --> 01:09:24,601
Or robbery-age.

1063
01:09:30,450 --> 01:09:31,576
Idiot!

1064
01:09:31,651 --> 01:09:33,745
(Cortina) Bloomington was fed up.

1065
01:09:33,820 --> 01:09:37,688
He sent for the most cold-blooded
gunslinger in all the West,

1066
01:09:37,757 --> 01:09:40,249
the Undertaker,

1067
01:09:40,326 --> 01:09:42,818
and 20 other snarling jackals.

1068
01:09:43,730 --> 01:09:47,496
My only recourse was
to turn to you gentlemen,

1069
01:09:47,567 --> 01:09:49,899
professionals, to get the job done.

1070
01:09:49,969 --> 01:09:54,668
Now this... bag of gold coins...

1071
01:09:56,743 --> 01:10:02,944
will go to the first man to deliver any of
the Kid's indispensable body parts to me,

1072
01:10:03,015 --> 01:10:06,508
along with some identifiable
portion of his anatomy.

1073
01:10:06,586 --> 01:10:09,248
His... head will do.

1074
01:10:09,322 --> 01:10:10,847
(laughter)

1075
01:10:13,593 --> 01:10:15,083
He's mine.

1076
01:10:16,229 --> 01:10:19,221
- Not unless | get to him first.
- Whoa, friend.

1077
01:10:22,802 --> 01:10:24,793
Word of advice...

1078
01:10:27,173 --> 01:10:30,165
| hear Cherokee's pretty tricky.

1079
01:10:30,243 --> 01:10:33,042
You right-handed or southpaw?

1080
01:10:33,546 --> 01:10:36,072
Southpaw, why?

1081
01:10:39,952 --> 01:10:43,115
Guess he'd better start
practicing with his right.

1082
01:10:43,189 --> 01:10:45,681
Like | said, he's mine.

1083
01:10:47,059 --> 01:10:50,586
(Bloomington) There's a challenge
for you, gentlemen.

1084
01:10:51,164 --> 01:10:53,155
Go get him.

1085
01:10:59,872 --> 01:11:02,466
Well, Mr. Undertaker,

1086
01:11:02,542 --> 01:11:04,101
you...

1087
01:11:04,177 --> 01:11:06,168
certainly are a...

1088
01:11:07,847 --> 01:11:10,077
| could do this.

1089
01:11:10,149 --> 01:11:13,517
The gold's for any man that can get him.

1090
01:11:16,689 --> 01:11:20,091
- | don't need no gold.
- (laughs)

1091
01:11:22,361 --> 01:11:24,659
Well, go get him then for free.

1092
01:11:33,973 --> 01:11:36,999
(Isaiah) Excuse me, ma'am?

1093
01:11:37,076 --> 01:11:40,171
Would you consider selling us
some fresh horses?

1094
01:11:40,246 --> 01:11:43,876
We don't cotton to your kind around here.

1095
01:11:45,518 --> 01:11:47,714
"My kind"? My kind's your kind.

1096
01:11:47,787 --> 01:11:51,485
My kind don't go around knockin' over
banks and robbin' little old ladies,

1097
01:11:51,557 --> 01:11:53,457
so just turn around and get!

1098
01:11:53,526 --> 01:11:56,791
(man) God Almighty,
it's the Cherokee Kid!

1099
01:11:56,863 --> 01:11:59,491
Abigail, that's the Cherokee Kid!

1100
01:11:59,565 --> 01:12:00,930
- Ma!
- (woman) What?

1101
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:02,866
- It's the Cherokee Kid!
- Oh!

1102
01:12:02,935 --> 01:12:06,428
You climb on off that horse
and rest yourself there, Mr. Cherokee.

1103
01:12:06,506 --> 01:12:09,669
Abigail, you go on in the kitchen
and set a table, girl.

1104
01:12:09,742 --> 01:12:12,370
We got famous company for dinner.

1105
01:12:12,445 --> 01:12:15,904
Where I'm from, ma'am, when your pa
asks you to do something, you hop to.

1106
01:12:15,982 --> 01:12:18,974
- (man) Abigail, hop to!
- (Ma) Come on, baby.

1107
01:12:21,320 --> 01:12:23,846
Thank you, ma'am.

1108
01:12:25,558 --> 01:12:29,256
Like | said, I'm in a jail cell,
waiting to be hung the next morning,

1109
01:12:29,328 --> 01:12:32,821
then my compadre here breaks
the walls down to get me out of there.

1110
01:12:32,899 --> 01:12:35,266
So I'm shootin' my way out,
bullets flyin' everywhere.

1111
01:12:35,334 --> 01:12:39,965
I reckon then, Cherokee, that's why
they upped your reward to $5,000.

1112
01:12:40,039 --> 01:12:42,030
That's a lot of money.

1113
01:12:44,677 --> 01:12:47,647
Tell us about that bank you cracked open
with that cannonball.

1114
01:12:47,713 --> 01:12:52,844
No, no! | wanna hear how you robbed
Texas Ranger payroll.

1115
01:12:53,719 --> 01:12:56,017
- Texas Rangers.
- Ranger payroll?

1116
01:12:56,088 --> 01:13:00,025
Now, that is an interesting story,
but the Pinedale bank...

1117
01:13:00,092 --> 01:13:02,424
- Pinedale!
- That was the most frightening.

1118
01:13:02,495 --> 01:13:04,623
Incredible.

1119
01:13:04,697 --> 01:13:06,756
You got the bank guards on one side.

1120
01:13:06,832 --> 01:13:10,166
You got that bloodthirsty,
no-good Jake Carver gang...

1121
01:13:10,236 --> 01:13:11,397
(all gasp)

1122
01:13:12,905 --> 01:13:14,066
Abby!

1123
01:13:14,140 --> 01:13:18,202
5,000 goes a long way
to helping us keep our land!

1124
01:13:18,277 --> 01:13:20,109
Talk to me, Bob.

1125
01:13:25,151 --> 01:13:27,210
Why you got me tied up?

1126
01:13:27,286 --> 01:13:29,880
And why did you hit me on the head?

1127
01:13:29,956 --> 01:13:31,947
We ain't no fools.

1128
01:13:32,024 --> 01:13:35,483
- We know you come to rob us.
- Rob you?

1129
01:13:35,561 --> 01:13:38,258
Why would | wanna rob poor people?
You ain't got nothing to take.

1130
01:13:38,331 --> 01:13:40,766
- I'm lookin' for Bloomington.
- Uh-huh, uh-huh!

1131
01:13:40,833 --> 01:13:44,269
He's workin' for the man
who's tryin' to steal our land! Perfect!

1132
01:13:44,337 --> 01:13:46,897
Workin' for him?
I'm huntin' that man down!

1133
01:13:46,973 --> 01:13:50,807
- He killed my ma and my pa.
- You lie like a pig in mud.

1134
01:13:50,876 --> 01:13:53,311
You think I'm lyin'?
Go out there and look at my horse.

1135
01:13:53,379 --> 01:13:55,780
Get some of them Bloomington
bank bags I've been robbing.

1136
01:13:55,848 --> 01:13:57,373
Go ahead and take 'em, take 'em all!

1137
01:13:57,450 --> 01:13:59,748
- Ma.
- Pa.

1138
01:13:59,819 --> 01:14:03,551
We don't want your stinkin' money!

1139
01:14:03,623 --> 01:14:05,523
(both) We don't?

1140
01:14:06,826 --> 01:14:09,761
You ain't got enough money
to give him, no way.

1141
01:14:09,829 --> 01:14:13,629
He don't want your money,
he wants your land.

1142
01:14:13,699 --> 01:14:16,031
You know, Ma,
Cherokee may be right.

1143
01:14:16,102 --> 01:14:18,093
- No.
- | mean, the man is everywhere.

1144
01:14:18,170 --> 01:14:20,332
He's got his hands in the bank,

1145
01:14:20,406 --> 01:14:23,068
the railroad, government.

1146
01:14:23,142 --> 01:14:26,339
Abigail, | don't think
we can rightly fight that man.

1147
01:14:26,412 --> 01:14:28,005
| can.

1148
01:14:28,848 --> 01:14:31,044
We can't afford you!

1149
01:14:31,117 --> 01:14:34,018
Well, since | was gonna kill him anyway,
I'll do it for free.

1150
01:14:34,086 --> 01:14:35,952
You just shut up your face!

1151
01:14:36,022 --> 01:14:42,052
Don't you go fillin' my ma and pa's head
with your fabrications and your falsehoods!

1152
01:14:42,128 --> 01:14:44,187
Let me tell you something...

1153
01:14:44,263 --> 01:14:46,823
Let me tell you something.

1154
01:14:46,899 --> 01:14:49,368
Next time you tie a man up,
use a proper knot.

1155
01:14:49,435 --> 01:14:54,168
You know, for a pretty woman,
you got an ugly attitude.

1156
01:14:55,107 --> 01:14:57,838
Thanks for all your hospitality,
but | got to be going.

1157
01:14:57,910 --> 01:15:00,572
But I'll be back, Abby.

1158
01:15:01,213 --> 01:15:02,942
(Cortina) | thank you also,

1159
01:15:03,015 --> 01:15:07,316
and | assure you that | respect
your strange manners.

1160
01:15:07,386 --> 01:15:13,223
| would like to return some day
to try to understand you!

1161
01:15:13,292 --> 01:15:15,852
jMadre de Dios!

1162
01:15:15,928 --> 01:15:18,226
- What'd he say?
- "Goodbye"?

1163
01:15:19,231 --> 01:15:21,666
| think she likes me.

1164
01:15:21,734 --> 01:15:23,828
Where the heck is my rifle?

1165
01:15:24,770 --> 01:15:27,239
- Abby, no!
- Wait a minute! That's company, girl!

1166
01:15:27,306 --> 01:15:29,741
Come on, giddy up!

1167
01:15:40,386 --> 01:15:43,879
Hell, Abigail,
| ain't never seen you miss before.

1168
01:15:43,956 --> 01:15:46,118
Well...

1169
01:15:46,192 --> 01:15:47,785
it's dark.

1170
01:15:47,860 --> 01:15:49,794
(Pa) Mm-hm.

1171
01:15:57,403 --> 01:15:59,428
That's him right there.

1172
01:16:09,081 --> 01:16:11,982
I'm looking for Sirus Bloomington.

1173
01:16:12,051 --> 01:16:14,042
(man) It's a coincidence, Cherokee.

1174
01:16:14,120 --> 01:16:16,487
Undertaker's out lookin' for you.

1175
01:16:17,089 --> 01:16:19,922
- Is that so?
- Best watch your back.

1176
01:16:20,826 --> 01:16:23,887
Undertaker's not the only
bloodsucker gunnin' for you.

1177
01:16:28,734 --> 01:16:34,070
Bloomington's gold's put a bee in
a lot of nasty good-for-nothin' bonnets.

1178
01:16:34,140 --> 01:16:36,973
Well, I'll keep that in mind.

1179
01:16:37,643 --> 01:16:41,477
And if your ass had eyeballs,
you'd be looking at the nastiest one!

1180
01:16:45,184 --> 01:16:46,743
Ooh.

1181
01:16:46,819 --> 01:16:49,754
| don't have no quarrel with you,
unless you want one.

1182
01:16:49,822 --> 01:16:51,620
Agh!

1183
01:16:51,690 --> 01:16:55,957
Now, y'all tell this "Undertaker"
| want a rendezvous with him tomorrow,

1184
01:16:56,028 --> 01:16:58,258
high noon on Main Street.

1185
01:16:58,330 --> 01:17:00,924
- You got that?
- Yeah.

1186
01:17:12,478 --> 01:17:14,970
What in the hell's a "rendezvous"?

1187
01:17:15,047 --> 01:17:18,312
(Cortina) That afternoon,
as Bloomington's bloodthirsty vultures

1188
01:17:18,384 --> 01:17:20,375
descended upon Larabee,

1189
01:17:20,452 --> 01:17:24,116
the Kid went back to the one ladybird
who had caught his eye.

1190
01:17:24,190 --> 01:17:27,160
What do you want?
Ain't you had enough?

1191
01:17:29,829 --> 01:17:31,820
Well, I...

1192
01:17:32,731 --> 01:17:35,462
| figure, a woman shoot at me four times,
| need to see her again.

1193
01:17:35,534 --> 01:17:38,697
Well, | don't wanna be seen with you,
so just move on, mister.

1194
01:17:38,771 --> 01:17:42,002
Oh, I'm sorry, ma'am,
| must be makin' your husband jealous.

1195
01:17:42,074 --> 01:17:44,873
| don't have a husband.

1196
01:17:44,944 --> 01:17:49,643
- Say that again.
- I said, I don't have a husband.

1197
01:17:49,715 --> 01:17:51,308
Why, I'm shocked, Miss Abby,

1198
01:17:51,383 --> 01:17:54,944
that some man wouldn't wanna be hit
by you with a frying pan on a daily basis.

1199
01:17:55,020 --> 01:17:58,650
And I'm shocked that for a man who
might be meetin' his maker tomorrow,

1200
01:17:58,724 --> 01:18:00,954
you acting awfully chipper.

1201
01:18:01,026 --> 01:18:04,519
I'm not the man who's gonna be
meeting his maker tomorrow.

1202
01:18:04,597 --> 01:18:06,156
You sure?

1203
01:18:06,232 --> 01:18:08,667
I'm sure.

1204
01:18:08,734 --> 01:18:13,467
Well... I'm gonna say a prayer for you
anyway, whether you like it or not!

1205
01:18:13,539 --> 01:18:15,701
| appreciate that, Miss Abby.

1206
01:18:16,675 --> 01:18:19,645
See you later, Cherokee Kid.

1207
01:18:23,616 --> 01:18:25,607
Yesterday...

1208
01:18:28,220 --> 01:18:30,382
when the Kid rode into town,

1209
01:18:30,456 --> 01:18:32,925
he was as ready as | ever saw.

1210
01:18:32,992 --> 01:18:35,051
He was ready!

1211
01:18:41,934 --> 01:18:43,925
He was the most...

1212
01:18:49,608 --> 01:18:51,474
The best...

1213
01:19:00,986 --> 01:19:03,387
He was the best man | ever knew.

1214
01:19:06,759 --> 01:19:09,353
Bloomington wants him
in the ground right now.

1215
01:19:09,428 --> 01:19:13,387
You don't touch that coffin.
We'll carry it out ourselves.

1216
01:19:22,608 --> 01:19:25,236
Al right.

1217
01:19:54,139 --> 01:19:56,608
This seems like a proper place
to end this story.

1218
01:19:56,675 --> 01:19:58,404
We don't care to hear your side.

1219
01:19:58,477 --> 01:20:01,970
No, but you're gonna,
so shut up and listen.

1220
01:20:02,047 --> 01:20:07,679
Yesterday morning when [ first saw the Kid
| could tell he was rattled.

1221
01:20:22,201 --> 01:20:24,431
So you're the Undertaker.

1222
01:20:24,503 --> 01:20:29,304
| just wanna look in the eyes of the man
that shot my brother before | kill him.

1223
01:20:30,009 --> 01:20:32,842
Cherokee feather...

1224
01:20:32,911 --> 01:20:35,005
I'm gonna take that after | kill you.

1225
01:20:39,385 --> 01:20:44,152
Word of advice:
don't mistake stupidity for courage.

1226
01:21:12,785 --> 01:21:15,379
Now it's your turn to die.

1227
01:21:17,389 --> 01:21:19,221
Sweet dreams.

1228
01:21:27,132 --> 01:21:29,430
"Sweet dreams,”

1229
01:21:29,501 --> 01:21:33,768
which is what | always told my little brother
when | tucked him in at night.

1230
01:21:35,774 --> 01:21:37,037
Oh, my...

1231
01:21:37,109 --> 01:21:40,044
| told you I'd come back
from my grave to kill you.

1232
01:21:40,112 --> 01:21:42,376
| knew it!

1233
01:21:43,649 --> 01:21:46,141
Where the heck is my rifle?

1234
01:21:48,754 --> 01:21:51,086
Bob, I'm so happy to see you!

1235
01:21:51,156 --> 01:21:52,555
| knew it!

1236
01:21:54,526 --> 01:21:56,790
I'm going after Bloomington.

1237
01:22:13,312 --> 01:22:15,406
(Isaiah) Jed, I'm coming!

1238
01:22:17,316 --> 01:22:22,482
- These furs are heavy.
- Come on! | got you, Bob!

1239
01:22:30,496 --> 01:22:32,260
Jed, cover me!

1240
01:22:40,572 --> 01:22:42,563
Let's go.

1241
01:22:56,321 --> 01:22:57,948
Take it easy.
You OK?

1242
01:22:58,023 --> 01:23:00,219
Oh, no! I've been better, Bob.

1243
01:23:00,292 --> 01:23:02,659
For a man so good with words,

1244
01:23:02,728 --> 01:23:04,492
that was the sorriest eulogy
| ever heard in my life.

1245
01:23:04,563 --> 01:23:07,624
Now that I'm dying,
| hope you do better for me.

1246
01:23:07,699 --> 01:23:10,930
Please, you're too conceited to die.

1247
01:23:11,003 --> 01:23:14,268
No matter what happens, little brother,
it's been the happiest day of my life.

1248
01:23:14,339 --> 01:23:17,070
- Me too. Let's finish it.
- Come on.

1249
01:23:17,142 --> 01:23:18,803
I'll be right back.

1250
01:23:25,951 --> 01:23:27,885
Let's do it.

1251
01:24:04,856 --> 01:24:06,346
Where the hell's Bloomington?

1252
01:24:06,425 --> 01:24:10,293
Where that coward always is,
trying to get away.

1253
01:24:21,940 --> 01:24:23,931
Bloomington.

1254
01:24:26,011 --> 01:24:29,311
Just stop what you're doing, Bloomington.

1255
01:24:35,587 --> 01:24:37,954
Not so tough by yourself, are you?

1256
01:24:38,023 --> 01:24:40,754
You're not gonna shoot a man
in the back, are ya?

1257
01:24:40,826 --> 01:24:45,127
Wouldn't bother me none.
Remember, you killed my mama.

1258
01:24:45,197 --> 01:24:47,666
Yeah, but that's because
| was really young and foolish.

1259
01:24:47,733 --> 01:24:50,225
| mean, I'm really sorry about that.

1260
01:24:50,302 --> 01:24:54,466
| was workin' for the railroad then,
and now the railroad is workin' for me.

1261
01:24:54,539 --> 01:24:57,406
What if we could become partners maybe?

1262
01:24:57,476 --> 01:24:59,638
Hell, I've got more money
than you could ever steal.

1263
01:24:59,711 --> 01:25:02,646
I'll be governor next year, more than likely.

1264
01:25:02,714 --> 01:25:05,149
Well, what do you say?

1265
01:25:05,217 --> 01:25:08,414
You know what?
You're a pathetic old man.

1266
01:25:10,055 --> 01:25:12,547
You're not even worth a bullet.

1267
01:25:24,069 --> 01:25:25,628
Ah-ha!

1268
01:25:46,091 --> 01:25:48,617
That was for my mama.

1269
01:25:56,501 --> 01:25:58,162
(gun cocking)

1270
01:25:58,236 --> 01:25:59,726
(gunshot)

1271
01:26:23,995 --> 01:26:26,293
(speaking Native American)

1272
01:26:31,770 --> 01:26:34,068
We lost a good friend.

1273
01:26:34,139 --> 01:26:36,836
My teacher.
Like a father to me.

1274
01:26:40,712 --> 01:26:43,238
I'm gonna miss you, Nat.

1275
01:26:47,419 --> 01:26:49,683
- Thank you.
- Kid.

1276
01:26:51,523 --> 01:26:55,824
(Isaiah) So, Jed, when did you
start calling yourself "the Undertaker"?

1277
01:26:55,894 --> 01:27:00,388
Well, | got in some trouble a while back,
little brother, and had to disappear.

1278
01:27:00,465 --> 01:27:03,833
Just like Mama taught me,
| killed myself off, buried myself,

1279
01:27:03,902 --> 01:27:06,064
and named my new self "the Undertaker."

1280
01:27:06,138 --> 01:27:08,766
Well, | almost got buried back there.
You almost hit me.

1281
01:27:08,840 --> 01:27:12,037
- You almost shot my ear off.
- It's a good thing | drew first.

1282
01:27:12,110 --> 01:27:13,908
You...? Who drew first?

1283
01:27:13,979 --> 01:27:15,777
You gettin' deaf in your old age?
| drew first.

1284
01:27:15,847 --> 01:27:16,905
- Did not.
- Did so.

1285
01:27:16,982 --> 01:27:18,780
- No, you did not.
- Yes, | did.

1286
01:27:18,850 --> 01:27:20,511
- You did not!
- Where are you goin'?

1287
01:27:20,585 --> 01:27:22,212
- Did not.
- Did.

1288
01:27:24,256 --> 01:27:27,988
Well, | figured I'd go out west,
get a chance to know my brother better.

1289
01:27:28,059 --> 01:27:30,084
Besides, there's some
more wrongs got to be right.

1290
01:27:30,162 --> 01:27:32,824
You killed your enemies,
you avenged your parents' death,

1291
01:27:32,898 --> 01:27:35,060
you even found your long-lost brother.

1292
01:27:35,133 --> 01:27:39,331
Isaiah, you don't have to be
the Cherokee Kid no more.

1293
01:27:39,404 --> 01:27:42,965
| know | don't have to be,
but | kinda like being the Cherokee Kid.

1294
01:27:43,041 --> 01:27:47,740
Besides, I'm good at it.
| like being a gunslinger.

1295
01:27:47,813 --> 01:27:50,111
Well, I'd best be going.

1296
01:27:50,182 --> 01:27:52,014
(Cortina) OK. Hasta la vista, compadre.

1297
01:27:52,083 --> 01:27:54,484
- And where do you think you're going?
- I'm going!

1298
01:27:54,553 --> 01:27:56,783
Didn't | just save your life?

1299
01:27:56,855 --> 01:27:58,846
Oh, Bob!

1300
01:28:03,995 --> 01:28:05,986
- OK.
- All right.

1301
01:28:14,239 --> 01:28:16,230
Take care, Miss Abby.

1302
01:28:23,949 --> 01:28:25,246
Woman, what is wrong with you?

1303
01:28:25,317 --> 01:28:28,548
You ain't ridin' off
into no damn sunset without me!

1304
01:28:30,822 --> 01:28:33,883
(Isaiah) C'mon, then.
You better keep up!

1305
01:28:57,682 --> 01:29:00,583
(Cortina whistles) Bob, this way!

1306
01:29:01,520 --> 01:29:03,215
(Isaiah) | know.

1307
01:29:03,288 --> 01:29:05,279
The sun got in my eyes!
