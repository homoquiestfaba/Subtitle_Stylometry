<i>Hustle up, guys.
You've got to get that defector</i>

2
00:01:20,871 --> 00:01:22,919
<i>and get the hell out of there. No delays.</i>

3
00:01:28,471 --> 00:01:30,838
Hey, Mouse, are you ready
with that 18-year-old aim?

4
00:01:31,231 --> 00:01:32,642
I'm on it, sir.

5
00:01:51,871 --> 00:01:52,952
Move. Let's go.

6
00:01:59,511 --> 00:02:01,832
All right, come on. Where is this guy at?

7
00:02:02,271 --> 00:02:04,592
<i>Come on, come on, come on.
Come on, come on, come on.</i>

8
00:02:12,071 --> 00:02:14,438
All right, Mouse. Give us that diversion.

9
00:02:18,871 --> 00:02:19,838
Let's move.

10
00:02:20,111 --> 00:02:21,522
Flint, stay put.

11
00:02:38,271 --> 00:02:39,921
Anyone ever tell you you fight ugly?

12
00:02:40,311 --> 00:02:41,676
Not from their backs, they don't.

13
00:02:41,951 --> 00:02:43,191
It's just...

14
00:02:43,391 --> 00:02:45,553
Flint, let's go. Flint?

15
00:02:45,911 --> 00:02:47,242
What the hell are you doing?

16
00:02:47,551 --> 00:02:48,757
<i>Just marking our territory, sir.</i>

17
00:02:49,271 --> 00:02:51,319
Private Gaines,
if you see Flint, shoot him.

18
00:02:51,511 --> 00:02:52,558
With pleasure.

19
00:02:57,911 --> 00:03:01,472
Defector in hand.
En route to pickup. Come on.

20
00:03:03,111 --> 00:03:04,192
I don't see him, do you?

21
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:08,202
<i>Flint, get your ass back to the team.</i>

22
00:03:08,311 --> 00:03:09,642
<i>We are on the move.</i>

23
00:03:11,431 --> 00:03:14,037
You ain't gonna believe this, Roadblock.

24
00:03:20,231 --> 00:03:21,198
Mother...

25

<i>Heavy enemy fire! I need you to bring
them up the line. Bring them up the line.</i>

42
00:04:22,631 --> 00:04:23,678
<i>Check that, Block, but I can't, man.</i>

43
00:04:23,791 --> 00:04:24,758
<i>I'm taking rounds back here.</i>

44
00:04:24,871 --> 00:04:25,952
<i>I need you! I need you now!</i>

45
00:04:26,071 --> 00:04:28,119
<i>Air strike! Call in an air strike!</i>

46
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:30,353
Wait. How do you call in an air strike?

47
00:04:30,511 --> 00:04:31,637
- Jesus!
- Can I bring...

48
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:33,873
What about one of those, like,
care package thingies?

49
00:04:33,991 --> 00:04:36,517
I'm bleeding out
and I need you to sprint.

50
00:04:36,951 --> 00:04:39,158
Can you use a care package thingy?
I can bring you one.

51
00:04:39,271 --> 00:04:40,841
A care package thingy?

52
00:04:40,951 --> 00:04:42,680
Who is shooting me? What is...

53
00:04:43,271 --> 00:04:45,160
I'm bleeding out right there and you're...

54
00:04:48,711 --> 00:04:49,792
Are you spinning?

55
00:04:49,951 --> 00:04:51,077
<i>You got to cover 360.</i>

56
00:04:51,271 --> 00:04:52,238
You're spinning.

57
00:04:52,471 --> 00:04:54,838
How could you be so good at combat?
You stink at this.

58
00:04:54,991 --> 00:04:56,880
I think you need to relax.
I believe I outrank you,

59
00:04:57,111 --> 00:04:58,522
-last time I checked.
- Not in my house, you don't.

60
00:05:00,311 --> 00:05:01,312
All right. Taking fire!

61
00:05:01,671 --> 00:05:03,639
Enemy fire! Time out! Enemy fire!

62
00:05:05,431 --> 00:05:06,637
Enemy contact!

63
00:05:06,751 --> 00:05:08,594
Uncle Duke, you have big ears.

64
00:05:09,751 --> 00:05:11,719
You got a big head. Come here!

65
00:05:12,071 --> 00:05:13,516
Returning fire! What's up, now?

66
00:05:15,071 --> 00:05:16,038
Returning fire!

67
00:05:16,311 --> 00:05:17,995
You can't scream your way
out of this one!

68
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:19,391
Yeah, requesting assistance,
brother Block!

69
00:05:19,591 --> 00:05:21,002
Pinned down, brother Duke.
Pinned down.

70
00:05:21,271 --> 00:05:23,717
That's all right. I got my boy here.
Demon dog!

71
00:05:27,671 --> 00:05:29,958
Grandma, help us! We need backup!

72
00:05:31,671 --> 00:05:34,595
Not the first time you sent a girl
running out of the room screaming.

73
00:05:35,351 --> 00:05:38,355
Not the first time
I sent two girls screaming from a room.

74
00:05:39,551 --> 00:05:40,837
Dude, completely inappropriate.

75
00:05:41,511 --> 00:05:43,195
- I'm just saying.
- Completely.

76
00:05:43,591 --> 00:05:44,831

82
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,407
The Pakistani President
may in fact be dead,

83
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,887
but Pakistan remains an ally.

84
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,287
And a sovereign nation.

85
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,081
Was.

86
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,647
Right now, they're a riot with a zip code.

87
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,481
Sir, every minute
we spend debating this,

88
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,364
there are live nuclear warheads

89
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,130
that sit amidst the chaos.

90
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:18,164
We can't let our enemies
get those warheads first.

91
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,250
Recommendations?

92
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,287
Go in.

93
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,840
Now.

94
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,045
Wait and see.

95
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,208
History rewards the bold.

96
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,524
I'm not going to be the man
who waited and saw.

97
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,009
Get me the G.l. Joes.

98

<i>Star One Flight commander

All right, listen up!

100
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,082
That nuke cannot have gone far.
Once we have it,

101
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,488
we will disarm it en route to the L.Z.!

102
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,450
We have its location narrowed down

103
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,767
to somewhere in this
missile assembly building.

104
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,769
We'll go in on the roof,
and fan out from there.

105
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,129
Flint, Jaye, if any support is needed,
you'll reinforce

106
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,446
as Roadblock leads the ground team.

107
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,042
Hell, yeah.

108
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,400
Hey, Mouse.

109
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,844
On my first drop
I popped a live round into my mouth.

110
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:20,691
Keeps your teeth from chattering.
Give it a shot.

111
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,650
- Delicious.
- Attaboy.

112
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,286
Jaye, what are we up against?

113
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,090
Insurgents are armed
with Kalashnikovs,

114
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,611
SVD Dragunovs and Type 50s.

115
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,441
Cold War stuff.

116
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,689
But don't relax, boys,
still put holes in you.

117
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,331
Whoa! What have you got there?

118
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:40,690
P-dub 381 black Tempest,
just out of the box. Rounds.

119
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,929
Quarter speed, remote controlled.

120
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,120
When did we get these?

121
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,528
We didn't. We did.

122
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,450

00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,569

- Don't touch.

124

00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,409
Approaching target.

Anyone else missing Snake Eyes?

128
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,724
I trained with Snake for six years.

129
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,524
If he ain't here, he's got good reason.

would you mind leading us
in a few words, please, sir?

133
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,365
In the immortal words of Jay-Z,

134
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,843
"Whatever deity may guide my life,

<i>Home in time for Top Chef.</i>

178
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,771
Good job, Tiny Tim.

179
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,689
All that Wii Combat Shooter
finally paying off, sir.

180
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,161
- How you doing, sir?
- Good.

181
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,611
All Joes present and accounted for.

182
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,642
Sit rep?

183
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,569
Rendered safe
and ready for transport, sir.

184
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,128
Square this one away and go get a beer.

185
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,401
Sounds good.

186
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,084
<i>Sir, the nukes have been
recovered and disabled.</i>

187
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,647
<i>All Joe missions successful.</i>

188
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,969
<i>Only minor injuries to report, sir.</i>

189
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,164
<i>Transport crews are prepping
the L.Z. for evac at 0200 hours.</i>

190
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,327
Great job, Captain.

191
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,568
We're modifying
your extraction plan back here.

192
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,886
Sit tight.

193
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,849
Let's go, Rivera, let's go.

194
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,360
Let me get this straight.

195
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,290
One whole weekend,

196
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,129
you looking after my little girls.

197
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,651
Look, I love your kids. I do.

198
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:36,009
But they live to terrorise me.
You trained them well.

199
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,001
And if you win?

200
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,009
<i>You</i> have <i>to take your next promotion.</i>

201
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:47,247
You pull a trigger, I pull a trigger.

202
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:50,764
I don't know if I'm gonna trust a pastry
from a gumbo chef.

203
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,770
Think about the wind.

204
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,886
Four knots? Left to right.

205
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,167
Humidity, I say, is about 62%.

206
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,004
You gonna feed me
the barometric pressure, too?

207
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,646
That's on the rise. Like your panties.

208
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,484
You love my panties.

209
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,644
That's an interesting choice of a joke.

210
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,205
Of all the things you could say...

211
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,528
-"You love my panties"?
- Are you gonna shut up?

212
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,687
- What does that mean?
- You gonna shut up?

213
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,606
- I'm looking out for you.
- I'm trying to do something.

214
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,449
- I just don't...
- Shut up, just shut up.

215
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,887
- I'm just saying.
- Just shut up.

216
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,010
How's your head rate?

217
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,929
That is not gonna count.

218
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,769
I get to go again because you talked.

219
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,964
You pulled a trigger.
Now I pull a trigger.

220
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,046
No, we're not doing that.

221
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,247
That is not gonna count.

222
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,327
Cheater.

223
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,244
I bought my little girls
a karaoke machine

224
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:59,404
and they love singing on it,
all night long.

225
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:02,450
There's no bedtime curfew,
so they're going to be up all night.

226
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,766
Make sure you bring your earplugs.

227
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,169
- C'mon, best two out of three.
- No.

228
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,327
Best two out of three. That didn't count.

229
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,851
You didn't tell me
about the karaoke machine.

230
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,440
Zandar.

231
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,131
Mr President.

232
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,963
I brought you some news.

233
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:54,241
The G.l. Joes are about to be
out of the picture.

234
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:00,089
And by "out of the picture," I mean

235
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,881
alive on earth.

236
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,284
Got a little too close to Mount Olympus.

237
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,559
Had to strike them down.

238
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,368
Had to strike them down.

239
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,771
They'll find you out, Zartan.

240
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,407
No. No, I don't think so.

241
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,009
That's the beauty of Nanomites.

242
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,930
Here, take a look.

243
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,447
Flawless microtechnology.

244
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,040
You're insane.

245
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,368
Recess over. Sit him down.

246
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,686
You know, they say
this is a thankless job.

247
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,364
But yesterday I hung out with Bono.

248
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,208
My new Secret Service,

249
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,129
they want to burn the Constitution.

250
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,641
Literally.

251
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:03,923
Do you know my favourite bit?
I get to blow stuff up.

252
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,689
I bet that endears you to the people.

253
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,121
Well, that's the thing.

254
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,607
Your approval ratings
climbed nine points.

255
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:15,203
Apparently, America wants
someone who looks like you,

256
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,810
but acts like me.

257
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,406
I'm the quicker blower-upper, baby.

258
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,889
Only one drawback.

259
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,249
The little wifey-pooh?

260
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,600
If you touch my family...

261
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,210
I'm yanking your chain.

262
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,529
Two long terms of you,

263
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,408
just a few shod months of me.

264
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,887
So let's not waste the time I got left.

265
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:43,202
Where is the prison that holds
Cobra Commander, and Destro?

266
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,928
Is this where I ask you,
what do you have planned?

267
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,770
Why does anyone want to be President?

268
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,925
Everybody wants to rule the world.

269
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,724
<i>All squads, gear up and clear the L.Z.</i>

270
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,765
Prepare for extraction.

271
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:06,201
Extraction? What are we, teeth?

272
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,927
- Reach H.Q.?
- No, I got nothing.

273
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,807
- Go up high.
- Roger, Sarge.

274
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,721
Block.

275
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,121
All our men accounted for.
Not a single drop of blood.

276
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,287
- Boots to asses.
- Yes, sir.

277
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,970
Except for that...
Did you scrape your elbow?

278
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,527
- No, it's red sweat.
- Yup.

279
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,441
That better have been
on somebody's face.

280
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,086
Hey, Duke.

281
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,521
You see that?

282
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,800
Security's early.

283
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,931
- Get down!
- Take cover!

284
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,320
Take cover!

285
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,165
To your weapons! Let's go!

286
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,005
On the ground! On the ground!

287
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,167
Mouse!

288
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,131
Get 'em out of the L.Z.!

289
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,207
Medic!

290
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,327
Go!

291
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,369
Flint's down! Flint's down!

292
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,609
- I'm going for him!
- Go!

293
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,006
<i>Ten o'clock!</i>

294
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:29,761
Get down!

295
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,528
Troops in contact!
Request immediate air support!

296
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,290
I repeat, immediate air support!

297
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,321
You all right? Come on, we got to move!
Go, go, go!

298
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,087
Help me!

299
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,609
You good? You hit?

300
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,010
Block, I got Flint. We got to get to cover!

301
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,401
Come on.

302
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,087
Incoming! Incoming! Go, go, go, go, go!

303
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,725
<i>Duke, come in.</i>

304
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:10,762
Duke!

305
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,727
Duke!

306
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:14,961
Get to cover, now!

307
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,641
- Go! Pull back! Rally point!
- Let's go!

308
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,400
Get to the well! Go!

309
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,085
Clear 'em out of there.

310
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,201
Fall back!

311
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,567
We're clear.

312
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,127
Let's go!

313
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:56,405
<i>We have met the enemy</i>

314
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,330
<i>and he is us.</i>

315
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:05,122
<i>Today, the world's elite fighting force,
the G.I. Joes,</i>

316
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,448
<i>abandoned their duty</i>

317
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:13,843
<i>and broke the sacred bond
that exists between</i>

318
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,651
<i>the American people</i>

319
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:18,645
<i>and those entrusted with their security.</i>

320
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:24,487
Ready and step.

321
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,520
Ready and

322
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:28,762
step!

323
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,482
<i>The first domino fell with the murder
of the Pakistani president.</i>

324
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,651
The assassin,

325
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,440
a <i>Joe,</i>

326
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,165
<i>call sign</i>

327
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,451
<i>Snake Eyes.</i>

328
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,484
<i>But he didn't act alone.</i>

329
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:49,520
<i>The Joes intended to use this situation</i>

330
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:52,803
<i>to seize Pakistan's nuclear arsenal.</i>

331
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,525
<i>Now this incident</i>

332
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:58,531
<i>serves as a sobering reminder
of the scourge of nuclear weapons.</i>

333
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,410
And to that end,

334
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:03,240
I call upon my fellow world leaders

335
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,364
to convene immediately to discuss

336
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,768
nuclear disarmament.

337
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,127
On three.

338
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:12,801
One.

339
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,326
Two .

340
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,687
Three!

341
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,885
<i>The G.I. Joes</i>

342
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:23,010
<i>clearly went beyond
the boundaries of their mission.</i>

343
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,121
<i>On my orders</i>

344
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:27,603
a <i>covert Special Forces unit
code named Cobra</i>

345
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,925
<i>terminated with extreme prejudice
Joe Command,</i>

346
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,369
<i>facilities, personnel.</i>

347
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:42,367
The G.l. Joes are no more.

348
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,520
We should leave.

349
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,885
There's nothing here.

350
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,086
There's nothing left here?

351
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,924
- That's not what he meant!
- These are our brothers!

352
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,087
That's not what he meant!

353
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,484
Whoever did this is going to come back.

354
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,440
We need to move.

355
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,208
You are our leader now.

356
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:07,842
We head due east until we're clear.

357
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:12,450
We're gonna find the man
who did this to Duke

358
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:13,766
and our brothers.

359
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,365
And we're gonna kill him.

360
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,201
Snake Eyes.

361
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,449
Last place I thought I'd see you.

362
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,641
Warden James. It's a pleasure.

363
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,571
I'm a very big fan. I love the black.

364
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,125
It's very Johnny Cash.

365
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:16,600
Come. Welcome to Einsargen.

366
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,167
Let me tell you a little bit
about the place.

367
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,249
Listen to me.
I sound like a real-estate agent.

368
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,885
I'm not here to sell you anything.

369
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,607
Except maybe hopelessness.

370
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,646
How was your trip?

371
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:50,723
The sensation that you're feeling,
your upside-down tummy?

372
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:53,686
It's due to our descent into
a former East German mine shaft.

373
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,689
It was the deepest they ever dug.

374
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:58,964
So deep in fact that
you just crossed out of Germany

375
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,809
into international territory.

376
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:03,049
Which allows me

377
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,768
certain jurisdictional freedoms.

378
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,720
One word,

379
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:18,084
awesome. This room is awesome!

380
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:21,843
Temperatures here exceed 210 degrees

381
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:25,602
when not artificially cooled to a crisp 68.

382
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:28,407
Almost calls for a Snuggie.

383
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,160
Wait till you see this next one.

384
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:41,444
See what I mean? This just slays me.

385
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:45,444
It's so interesting.
This is where science has come.

386
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,249
Did you know that during REM sleep

387
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,250
the human body

388
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:53,050
produces a neural chemical

389
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,050
which paralyses
every muscle in the body

390
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:57,766
but the heart and the eyes?
This prevents us

391
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,690
from acting out our dreams.

392
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,646
We have injected both of these men

393
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,731
with a synthetic version.

394
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,890
They're perfectly awake.
They're conscious,

395
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,606
they're aware of everything
that's going on around them.

396
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:13,604
It's just that they're
trapped inside themselves.

397
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:19,530
Well, I believe you know
your new neighbours, Destro,

398
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,960
Cobra Commander.

399
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:33,366
The three of you are like
my fantasy football team.

400
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,681
Gentlemen.

401
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,848
Now as your eyes and mind

402
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:48,000
travel to where you cannot,
I want you to agonise.

403
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,930
I want you to pine.

404
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:53,921
I want you to ache for what once was
and will never be again.

405
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:57,764
I want you to doubt
that there was ever a word for escape.

406
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,811
Welcome to hell.

407
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:05,446
You have no idea.

408
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:08,169
Snake Eyes speaks.

409
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:11,207
It never occurred to me
what you might sound like.

410
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:14,086
But I've always thought about
what you might look like.

411
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,129
We'll have that mask.

412
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,089
Storm Shadow.

413
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,968
So you killed the Pakistani president.

414
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,929
Well, you're not exactly
my first-round draft pick,

415
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,929
but I've always been a fan.

416
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,128
Protocol says we make
a distress call, right?

417
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:51,891
No. Protocol died with the unit.

418
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,081
What?

419
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,486
How's anybody gonna know we're alive?

420
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,601
They're not, 'cause we're not.

421
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,640
To our government,

422
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,004
to our families,
but especially to our enemy,

423
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,964
we were KIA at 0600 hours
in the Indus Valley Desert.

424
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,043
But we have to at least try.
I mean, there might be...

425
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,846
No. Anything we do now
is a rumour of a rumour.

426
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:09,927
Any and all traces

427
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,844
of our existence is terminated.

428
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:15,045
The only one I trust out there
is Snake Eyes.

429
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:18,971
When we got hit,

430
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,291
how we got hit,

431
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,769
we were set up right from the start.

432
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,050
How many stars would someone need
on their shoulder

433
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,447
to call an attack like that? Four? Five?

434
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:31,086
No, not stars. Buttons on his suit.

435
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,091
National Security Advisor.
Secretary of Defence.

436
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:37,329
No. There's only one man
who could authorise a strike like that.

437
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,730
And I voted for him.

438
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,689
All vitals on Cobra Commander
are steady.

439
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:02,408
Storm Shadow
nerve prohibitors injected.

440
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,642
Sixty-two degrees on a change of 4%.

441
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,160
Aerial threat! Down!

442
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,965
We're going home.

443
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:04,169
Full arrest! Full arrest!

444
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,170
No drill! Bring the restraints!

445
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,560
Remove the containment lid!

446
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,564
Where's the serum? Quickly!

447
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:14,407
Adrenaline now. Now! Adrenaline!

448
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,688
Let's go! Quickly, quickly!

449
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:18,881
Move! Move!

450
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,491
Where's the serum?

451
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,691
Let's go!

452
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,362
Peel back! Move!

453
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:33,050
What do you mean,
his heart stopped beating?

454
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,846
No one here dies unless I say so!

455
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:37,841
Oh, my God.

456
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:38,882
Fire!

457
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,321
Fire! Fire!

458
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:46,686
Take him down!

459
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,246
Take him down!

460
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,571
Clear on the north!

461
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,081
Clear!

462
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,491
Welcome to hell.

463
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,766
Slop!

464
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:17,084
You shoot anything
that walks through that door!

465
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,081
Anything!

466
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,131
Storm Shadow.

467
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,210
Never a doubt.

468
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,249
Cobra Commander.

469
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:35,962
Destro.

470
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,889
You're out of the band.

471
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,241
Come on.

472
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,567
Come on.

473
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,880
I see you've arranged transportation.

474
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:14,051
Making more things go boom
by 9:00 a.m.

475
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,049
than most people do all day.

476
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,643
Firefly. Good to see you, old friend.

477
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,081
Sir.

478
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:24,281
Some people
just didn't want to let me in.

479
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:28,522
Now, I busted out of eight prisons.

480
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,370
But I only broke into one.

481
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:35,080
All communications have been cut off.
No one will know you're even missing.

482
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:54,248
Take him to the mountains to heal.

483
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:57,842
I'll need him
for the war I'm about to start.

484
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:37,320
Sir, launch controls are nearly up.
The director was running behind.

485
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:41,605
Well, he ain't running behind no more.
Or anywhere else, for that matter.

486
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,168
Armour prototype
is complete to your specs.

487
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,044
I got it up to 60 on the dyno today.

488
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:49,129
You'll like this. Working title,

489
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:51,527
High Speed Sentry. HISS.

490
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,724
It's good to have you back, sir.

491
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,530
Ain't she a beauty?

492
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:04,680
Soon the world will cower
in the face of Zeus.

493
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:15,727
All we've been missing
is our Commander.

494
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,728
Good to have you back, boss.

495
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,851
Cool mask.

496
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,889
Someone took his time.

497
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:29,925
Not easy to sneak out of that big, white,

498
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:32,647
11-bedroom, 35-and-a-half bath...

499
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,122
Just don't forget who put you there.

500
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:36,969
Or the rock you crawled out from.

501
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:40,682
Firefly. It's good to know
we're not running low on crazy.

502
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,691
Still all 10 fingers?

503
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,570
How is our former President?

504
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,808
He is worth his weight in platinum.

505
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:55,323
You know, they call it a waterboard,

506
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,569
but I never get bored.

507
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:02,123
In 48 hours, Zeus will launch.

508
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,811
Just one wrinkle.

509
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,486
Three Joes somehow survived
our little house cleaning.

510
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:11,085
A drone picked up voiceprints
in the Indus Valley.

511
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,009
Can I trust you with nothing?

512
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,691
They'll slip up.

513
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,409
And when they do,

514
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,889
I'll hunt 'em to ground.

515
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,931
<i>Hoo-ah .</i>

516
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:28,804
First the massacre in the desert,

517
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:33,000
and now Storm Shadow
and Cobra Commander escape prison.

518
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:35,408
So your training is
more important than ever.

519
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:38,285
Jinx, cousin to Storm Shadow,

520
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:42,489
Snake Eyes,
it is our time to join the fight

521
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:46,763
<i>and defend the honour
of our fellow G.l. Joes.</i>

522
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:49,168
<i>We must find Storm Shadow.</i>

523
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:52,848
<i>He may know more about the future
of Cobra attacks.</i>

524
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:57,808
<i>I fear what happened with the Joes
may only be the beginning.</i>

525
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,685
Defend yourselves.

526
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,563
Your enemy will show you no mercy.

527
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,205
Enough, Snake Eyes.

528
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,609
I know you doubt Jinx's loyalty.

529
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:31,639
But she is Arashikage
and she will fight with honour.

530
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:34,246
But she is Arashikage
and she will fight with honour.

531
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:38,328
<i>The longer we wait,
the stronger Storm Shadow becomes.</i>

532
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:42,285
With this sword
you must capture him,

533
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,324
so we can uncover Cobra's plans

534
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,408
and restore the Arashikage's name.

535
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:51,246
But in order for me
to bring him to justice,

536
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:55,203
you must deliver him to me alive.

537
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,770
No, no, it's cool.

538
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:14,407
I got it.

539
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,160
You lost, little man?

540
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,571
No, I ain't lost.

541
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:21,929
I think you got the wrong street.

542
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,969
So why don't you take Miley Cyrus

543
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:25,650
and Ryan Seacrest

544
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,051
and head back that way?

545
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,769
I'm going that way.

546
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,281
Oh. yeah?

547
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,447
Yeah.

548
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:39,250
Go ahead, Marvin.

549
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:41,924
Man, don't call me that name.

550
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:43,971
What's up? Little Marvin!

551
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,480
- Marvin?
- Big Marvin now.

552
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:47,170
Had you worried for a minute, man.

553
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:49,806
Watch your hand back there, boy.
You don't want them to get you.

554
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:51,724
Let me introduce you. This is Flint.

555
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:52,807
What up?

556
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:54,367
Lady Jaye.

557
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:55,447
Lady Jaye. Hey.

558
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:57,406
- Welcome back.
- Thank you.

559
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:59,609
It's what happens
when you're in trouble, you come home.

560
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:00,767
Home is where the help is.

561
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:01,802
Amen.

562
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:03,611
Well, we got you.

563
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:05,325
Set up at the rec centre.

564
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,568
Lay low over there.
Nobody gonna bother you.

565
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:09,650
As far as wheels go,

566
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,889
I'm gonna let you roll my truck.

567
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:13,047
Thank you.

568
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:15,171
I got payments on that truck, man.

569
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,123
I don't get it like I used to. All right?

570
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:18,162
Thank you, Stoop.

571
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,450
I owe you one, brother.

572
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:23,326
Actually, you owe me two.

573
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,331
That other one don't count.

574
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:27,960
Welcome home, Marvin.

575
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:36,886
Watch your step.

576
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:40,249
No one's been here for years.
This is gonna have to be our pit for now.

577
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:48,087
Wow. It's an actual pit.

578
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,770
It's my old stomping ground.

579
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,370
Are you sure
we can trust this Stoop guy?

580
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,131
Stoop's no angel.

581
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,529
But he is family and we can trust him.

582
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,280
Can we be traced?

583
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:08,369
We can mask our IP addresses.

584
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,687
I'll cyber-blast an encoded beacon
every six hours.

585
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:12,371
If any Joes did survive,

586
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:13,641
we need to let them know
where we're at.

587
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:15,000
All right. Well, let's get to work.

588
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:17,242
Flint, inventory every piece
of equipment we got left.

589
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:19,362
Jaye, start that database
on our President.

590
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:21,960
We'll find out what's going on
with our Commander-in-Chief.

591
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:25,084
He's not acting like the man we know.
We find out why,

592
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:27,328
we can start being soldiers again.

593
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:46,322
<i>Lieutenant Lady Jaye,
requesting immediate aid.</i>

594
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:47,811
<i>If any Joes have survived...</i>

595
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:50,207
This channel's restricted to Joes,
isn't it?

596
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:52,449
<i>"Magnetic west of the Potomac.</i>

597
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:53,721
They're alive.

598
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,367
<i>This is Lieutenant Lady Jaye
requesting immediate aid.</i>

599
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:00,011
<i>Lieutenant Lady Jaye,
this is Jinx and Snake Eyes.</i>

600
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:01,884
<i>We are in pursuit of Storm Shadow.</i>

601
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,164
Even if Snake Eyes and Jinx
grab Storm,

602
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:10,044
they're still halfway around the world.

603
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:13,800
We're on our own.

604
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:17,160
Enough for a battle.

605
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:19,127
Not a war.

606
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:21,651
We're fighting uphill here.

607
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:27,564
I came here when I was 14
with a life expectancy of 13.

608
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:31,643
I was bounced around
from home to home, until this

609
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:34,725
became my home.

610
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:36,683
Guys were lined up
outside that door to fight me.

611
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:40,923
They whooped my skinny ass so much
I started to enjoy it.

612
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:42,521
Till one winter,

613
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:46,126
I grew 8 inches and gained 60 pounds.

614
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:50,683
I punched a guy so hard
he couldn't move his arm to tap out.

615
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:53,168
Then when the Joes
came recruiting to the hood,

616
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:55,243
I'd already beaten down half of it.

617
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:59,930
I became a Joe to serve. In the field.

618
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:03,967
So if we're fighting uphill,
we take the hill.

619
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:08,687
Hey, I got something you'll want to see.

620
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,207
During my check of the President,
look what I found.

621
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:15,088
This is the President on August 9th.

622
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:17,409
<i>...an addiction to offshore energy,</i>

623
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:20,411
<i>where we're forced to be
kind of embroiled</i>

624
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:22,284
<i>in the affairs of foreign nations.</i>

625
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:24,209
And this is 10 days later.

626
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:26,170
<i>I mean, otherwise, we're sort of...</i>

627
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:31,126
These are conversational fillers.
Little phrases

628
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:33,004
we spit out to give our brain
a chance to catch up

629
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:34,566
with our mouth. Like...

630
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:36,000
- Like.
- Yes.

631
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:37,520
And our President?

632
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:39,689
Between August 9th and August 19th,

633
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:41,451
he stopped using
"you know" and "kind of"

634
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:43,608
and started using "I mean" and "sort of."

635
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:46,167
But that's not all.
"Supper" became "dinner."

636
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:47,406
<i>"Soda" became "pop."</i>

637
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:50,447
One President, two fingerprints.

638
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:52,564
But it's a few words, right?
I mean, how much can...

639
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:53,647
Check this out.

640
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:57,484
Two press conferences,
July 31st, September 1st.

641
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:00,202
See his fingers clasped?

642
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:02,768
Left thumb on top
versus right thumb on top.

643
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,684
The same person
never does this differently,

644
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:05,961
it feels wrong.

645
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:11,729
What if the President

646
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:14,131
isn't the President?

647
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:18,121
Look, if the Commander-in-Chief
is an imposter

648
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:21,327
and he's the one that ordered the attack,

649
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:24,206
we have to assume
that there's no one we can trust.

650
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:25,801
There is one man.

651
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:31,800
He's the reason we call ourselves Joes.

652
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:01,002
Hello?

653
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:16,682
I'll take two cases of Thin Mints
and a box of Chuckle Lucks.

654
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:18,930
Lower your weapons.

655
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:23,080
General Colton, if I may...

656
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:24,731
Shut your mouth, Brenda.

657
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:27,970
My name's not Brenda.

658
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:29,480
How'd you get in?

659
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:31,410
Sir, apologies.

660
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:33,808
- Sergeant Marvin...
- I know who you are.

661
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:35,491
Then you know why I'm here.

662
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:45,647
<i>It's not like
I don't hear what you're saying.</i>

663
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:48,369
But an imposter President?

664
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:54,286
How come when the General says it,
it sounds crazy?

665
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:57,569
Whafd they do with the real President?

666
00:47:57,880 --> 00:47:59,120
We fear he's dead.

667
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:03,164
I don't think so.
You're not going to kill your best asset.

668
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:08,209
"Conrad Hauser. Duke."

669
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:10,120
Your captain.

670
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:16,128
Tell me one thing you know about him.

671
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:18,050
Great soldier.

672
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:21,810
Better friend.

673
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:24,529
And he saved my life, sir.

674
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:29,407
<i>Good .</i>

675
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:34,370
What you're proposing is treason.

676
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:37,168
I'm gonna need something
a little more to go on

677
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:38,691
than overlapping thumbs.

678
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:43,168
Before you retired,
you sewed on a security commission

679
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:45,084
with the President's Chief of Staff.

680
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:47,129
General Colton, can you get us close?

681
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:48,601
Negative.

682
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:52,730
I can't scratch my ass in this town
without getting on the watch list.

683
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:54,689
Brenda, hand me that pen.

684
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,364
Girl Scout to secretary.

685
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:01,565
Amazing. Name's not Brenda.

686
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:05,250
It's just a pen.

687
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:08,964
Avenue K, Georgetown. 9:00 p.m.

688
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:12,284
There's a poker game
with the Chief of Staff there.

689
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:14,531
He's not a good poker player.

690
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:15,960
He's got 1,000 tells.

691
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:21,405
We only need one.

692
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:25,847
Hey, hon.

693
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:28,771
Just got out of poker. Poorer but wiser.

694
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:31,324
It was a good day, actually.

695
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:33,881
The Prez was taking
his crazy pills again.

696
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:38,647
Baby, I'm gonna have to call you back.

697
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:39,961
Yeah.

698
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:41,400
Love you.

699
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:47,927
Excuse me.

700
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:49,207
Hi.

701
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:50,361
Hi.

702
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:52,449
You need a hand with your bags?

703
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:54,201
Sure.

704
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:57,042
No problem. There you go.

705
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:58,082
Thank you.

706
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:00,528
Who said chivalry is dead, right?

707
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:01,687
Chivalry.

708
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:04,764
Talk like that,
I'm gonna get myself in trouble.

709
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:06,167
Where we heading?

710
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:07,281
Just right around the corner.

711
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:18,323
That tingly feeling is amobarbital.

712
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:20,727
It's a sedative that causes
anterograde amnesia.

713
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:22,360
In five minutes, you're gonna be asleep.

714
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:24,881
In another five, you're gonna wake up
with no idea I ever existed.

715
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:32,731
Notice anything strange
about your boss?

716
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:37,204
Maybe. Why?

717
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:39,921
'Cause you're gonna make
a phone call for us. Get us close to him.

718
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:42,250
But don't worry.
You're gonna forget everything,

719
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:44,362
so your conscience will be clear.

720
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:47,083
Why are you doing this?

721
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:49,243
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

722
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:52,771
Make the call.

723
00:59:09,271 --> 00:59:10,511
Thank God.

724
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:22,127
<i>El Presidente is on</i> a <i>roll.</i>

725
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:23,971
<i>His numbers are up.</i>

726
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:26,401
<i>And I'm not just talking about his age.</i>

727
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:30,447
<i>Now, I'm not gonna call
our Commander-in-Chief old.</i>

728
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:33,811
<i>Actually, he called me the other day
for some advice.</i>

729
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:35,564
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

730
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:38,486
<i>He wanted to hook up
the nation's nuclear arsenal</i>

731
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:39,567
<i>to the Clapper.</i>

732
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:45,401
<i>I'm sorry, ma'am, you're...</i>

733
00:59:45,640 --> 00:59:47,130
Late, I know.

734
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:49,009
Imagine the army it takes
to make me look like this.

735
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:52,963
Forgive me.
That's an army I'd like to enlist in.

736
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:54,884
Speaking of lists,

737
00:59:55,120 --> 00:59:57,441
would you like to explain
why you're not on ours?

738
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:00,209
Here she is. Chief of Staff.

739
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:03,847
Enjoy your evening, Miss Vandervooﬂ.

740
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:11,522
<i>I'm in.</i>

741
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:13,489
Roger that. Standing by.

742
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:15,442
Jaye?

743
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:18,447
You keep your head down. Be safe.

744
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:20,125
<i>Mr Carville was nice enough to mention</i>

745
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:23,050
<i>one of my passions.
Nuclear disarmament.</i>

746
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:24,686
<i>In just days,</i>

747
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:27,201
<i>the leaders of the world's
eight nuclear nations</i>

748
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:30,086
<i>will gather at historic Fort Sumter</i>

749
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:32,209
<i>for a nuclear summit.</i>

750
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:36,763
<i>But before the Atomic Eight
break bread,</i>

751
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:38,121
<i>it's our turn.</i>

752
01:00:39,240 --> 01:00:40,810
Thank you, James. Thank you so much.

753
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:48,367
Mr President.
Amy Vandervooﬂ, Fox News.

754
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:50,602
<i>Fox, of course.</i>

755
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:52,802
That's why you look so
"fair and balanced."

756
01:00:54,120 --> 01:00:56,361
Very cute.
But I was actually hoping to have a...

757
01:00:56,760 --> 01:00:57,682
Dance?

758
01:00:57,840 --> 01:00:59,410
I was going to say, quote.

759
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:00,920
<i>Okay, here's a quote.</i>

760
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:03,725
<i>The world will change
after my nuclear summit.</i>

761
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:05,330
<i>How about we dance?</i>

762
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:08,648
<i>I really, I don't dance.</i>

763
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:10,562
Sorry.

764
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:13,328
<i>Thank you, Mr President.
You gave me what I need.</i>

765
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:15,409
<i>But I really have to make my deadline.</i>

766
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:17,650
-It's been a pleasure.
- Thank you.

767
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:24,011
How are you?

768
01:01:24,120 --> 01:01:25,167
Good, sir.

769
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:36,966
<i>I got a strand of hair from his jacket.
I hope it's enough.</i>

770
01:01:37,240 --> 01:01:38,651
Come on.

771
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:39,761
<i>Copy that.</i>

772
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:41,127
Standing by for I.D.

773
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:51,884
All units, setting condition orange.
Stand by.

774
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:55,446
I don't take no for an answer.

775
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:03,164
Almost there.

776
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:06,527
<i>Come on, come on, come on, come on.</i>

777
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:10,122
Zartan?

778
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:13,609
Jaye, get out of there now.

779
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,525
Oh, my God.

780
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:18,081
We have an unauthorised I.D.
She's a Joe.

781
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:20,168
We have a Joe on the premises.

782
01:02:23,560 --> 01:02:24,891
Jaye.

783
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:27,720
Jaye, now.

784
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:35,090
<i>I'm out.</i>

785
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:39,885
<i>He's on his way down.
This is your only chance.</i>

786
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:42,441
Roger that, Jaye. I got it from here.

787
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:46,931
Block? You only get one shot at this.

788
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:52,965
One in the chamber.

789
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:06,049
Block? Block, where are you?

790
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:51,410
I want to see that face.

791
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:53,968
The one where you realise
today's the day.

792
01:03:54,560 --> 01:03:55,959
It's the face all those pretty little Joes
had in the desert

793
01:03:55,960 --> 01:03:56,961
It's the face all those pretty little Joes
had in the desert

794
01:03:57,080 --> 01:03:58,764
when I lit them all up like fireworks!

795
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:13,809
I really want to see that face.

796
01:04:17,960 --> 01:04:19,246
There it is.

797
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:53,243
If Cobra and Zaﬂan
are in the White House,

798
01:04:53,360 --> 01:04:54,930
then the world is at stake.

799
01:04:55,560 --> 01:04:56,527
Storm Shadow.

800
01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:59,087
You will tell us Cobra's endgame,

801
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:01,410
or die

802
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:05,685
by the same sword you once
used to kill our master.

803
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:07,127
Your sword,

804
01:05:09,160 --> 01:05:12,164
given to you
by our beloved Hard Master.

805
01:05:13,360 --> 01:05:16,364
Do you deny that your envy and hatred
drove you to shed

806
01:05:16,840 --> 01:05:18,763
the Hard Master's blood?

807
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:23,446
<i>It's possible to feel so much hate</i>

808
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:26,127
you stop feeling it at all.

809
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:29,770
Like a fish not knowing it's in water.

810
01:05:31,880 --> 01:05:34,406
But my path was chosen for me

811
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:37,011
<i>b'! my enemy</i>

812
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:40,684
who framed me
for killing the Hard Master.

813
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:45,610
And my friends

814
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:49,450
who believed it.

815
01:05:54,080 --> 01:05:57,243
Why defend yourself to men
too blind to see?

816
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:02,004
That is the Hard Master's blood.

817
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:06,120
But that is not...

818
01:06:09,560 --> 01:06:11,005
Wail!

819
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,331
...my sword.

820
01:06:22,560 --> 01:06:25,245
Arashikage steel does not break.

821
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:32,846
I have asked myself over and over

822
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:37,403
who despised me enough
to destroy my life?

823
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:40,883
I am sorry, Storm Shadow.

824
01:06:41,320 --> 01:06:44,483
But who would stand to gain the most
by framing you for this crime?

825
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:50,281
Your young adversary
who chased you away?

826
01:06:56,840 --> 01:07:00,287
Or the man into whose arms
you were chased.

827
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:04,689
<i>Someone who welcomed you,</i>

828
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:07,130
<i>showed you kindness.</i>

829
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:08,967
<i>He needed me.</i>

830
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:11,090
For who I would become.

831
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:15,807
A warrior of great skill and anger.

832
01:07:17,680 --> 01:07:21,810
<i>The man who betrayed me
was capable of great ingenuity,</i>

833
01:07:24,680 --> 01:07:26,091
violence,

834
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:31,370
<i>but most of all,</i>

835
01:07:32,840 --> 01:07:34,251
disguise.

836
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:39,211
<i>Zartan.</i>

837
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:41,211
Yes.

838
01:07:42,360 --> 01:07:45,409
<i>Tell us what he and Cobra have planned</i>

839
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:48,445
<i>SO we can destroy OUT common enemy</i>

840
01:07:49,120 --> 01:07:50,360
together.

841
01:07:55,120 --> 01:07:56,201
Thanks.

842
01:08:10,680 --> 01:08:12,569
If my dad could see me now...

843
01:08:12,840 --> 01:08:14,251
What are you talking about?

844
01:08:15,880 --> 01:08:17,120
He wouldn't believe it.

845
01:08:18,040 --> 01:08:19,121
Why?

846
01:08:22,440 --> 01:08:24,329
Third generation military.

847
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:26,967
Desperately wanted a fourth, and

848
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:29,090
<i>my mom had me.</i>

849
01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:36,087
Well, he must be
real proud of you, then.

850
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:38,648
He didn't believe in female soldiers.

851
01:08:39,400 --> 01:08:41,846
I finally asked him why. He said

852
01:08:43,320 --> 01:08:46,164
he didn't want to put his life
in the hands of a woman.

853
01:08:48,520 --> 01:08:50,249
I enlisted the next day.

854
01:08:51,800 --> 01:08:53,848
Spent the next seven years

855
01:08:54,200 --> 01:08:56,965
trying to outrank him
so he'd have to salute me.

856
01:08:58,240 --> 01:08:59,526
Did it work?

857
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:06,729
He died before I got the chance.

858
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:09,840
I'm sorry.

859
01:09:24,040 --> 01:09:26,168
You know,
if it's any sod of a consolation,

860
01:09:27,320 --> 01:09:28,731
I'm actually gonna miss the red.

861
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:32,291
You look real nice.

862
01:09:38,360 --> 01:09:39,930
That was for the tax hike.

863
01:09:40,240 --> 01:09:42,004
Like you pay taxes.

864
01:09:42,480 --> 01:09:44,369
Ain't always about me.

865
01:09:45,360 --> 01:09:46,850
HEY. hey, hey, hey.

866
01:09:48,280 --> 01:09:49,850
We still need the man.

867
01:09:51,480 --> 01:09:53,847
Besides, we've grown close.

868
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:57,204
Is Storm Shadow in?

869
01:09:57,520 --> 01:10:01,206
Don't you worry about him.
He'll be more than ready.

870
01:10:01,680 --> 01:10:03,808
I'm not too impressed with your Cabinet.

871
01:10:05,040 --> 01:10:07,407
No confirmation hearings,
that's what you get.

872
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:10,285
Enough!

873
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:12,404
I'll take it from here.

874
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:16,243
He who controls this briefcase,

875
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:19,126
controls the U.S. nuclear arsenal

876
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:20,725
and the fate of humanity.

877
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,241
Open your eyes, Mr Ex-President.

878
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:27,966
The eyes are the windows to the soul.

879
01:10:30,720 --> 01:10:31,960
Open up.

880
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:33,320
Zeus is ready.

881
01:10:34,920 --> 01:10:38,288
We just need
one final piece of the puzzle.

882
01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:41,482
Well done.

883
01:10:44,720 --> 01:10:46,404
History will stand in judgment.

884
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:49,010
Not of me. Of you.

885
01:10:55,560 --> 01:10:56,686
What do we got, Jaye?

886
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,367
Zaﬂan's entire focus
has been this nuclear summit.

887
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:02,085
It has to be the key
to whatever he's planning.

888
01:11:02,280 --> 01:11:04,328
All right. Well, then that's our target.

889
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:06,047
Yeah.

890
01:11:07,560 --> 01:11:09,130
Guys, move.

891
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:32,524
I think I'm faster than you, Snake Eyes.

892
01:11:37,160 --> 01:11:38,730
Damn Ninjas.

893
01:11:40,760 --> 01:11:42,250
Good to see you, brother.

894
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:43,721
Jaye.

895
01:11:44,360 --> 01:11:45,282
Jinx.

896
01:11:48,520 --> 01:11:49,760
Back up.

897
01:11:52,160 --> 01:11:53,127
He's with us.

898
01:11:54,680 --> 01:11:56,091
I am not with you.

899
01:11:56,440 --> 01:11:58,010
But for this once,

900
01:11:58,520 --> 01:11:59,965
I am not against you.

901
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:01,525
How many of our men has he killed?

902
01:12:02,040 --> 01:12:03,610
We're supposed to fight with him?

903
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:11,441
The leaders of the world
will gather tomorrow. It's a trap.

904
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:13,603
Storm is the only one
who knows Cobra's plan

905
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:16,127
inside and out.
He can help us find a way to stop it.

906
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:18,529
But we have to work together.

907
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:24,521
All right.

908
01:12:26,160 --> 01:12:27,241
Let's move.

909
01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:42,209
Merry Christmas.

910
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:46,049
Makes you wonder
about your neighbours.

911
01:12:58,400 --> 01:12:59,481
Nice.

912
01:13:10,040 --> 01:13:11,121
Open up that couch.

913
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:19,925
Anything?

914
01:13:20,720 --> 01:13:22,131
I brought my own.

915
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:25,240
Nice.

916
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:44,680
Yeah, that'll work.

917
01:13:48,200 --> 01:13:49,167
Hey.

918
01:13:50,160 --> 01:13:51,241
That one's mine.

919
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:54,129
This really is Patton's gun, isn't it?

920
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:56,291
Gift from his family.

921
01:13:57,360 --> 01:13:58,361
What an honour.

922
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:00,201
You bet.

923
01:14:02,160 --> 01:14:05,323
I was actually thinking about
something a little more your size.

924
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:12,049
Try not to scratch her up.

925
01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:15,729
Idles a little rough in neutral.

926
01:14:17,800 --> 01:14:19,529
I ain't gonna be in neutral.

927
01:14:20,240 --> 01:14:21,480
<i>Hoo-ah .</i>

928
01:14:22,360 --> 01:14:23,725
What about you?

929
01:14:25,960 --> 01:14:28,486
DOD says
I can't come out of retirement.

930
01:14:32,520 --> 01:14:34,761
They didn't say anything
about reenlisting.

931
01:14:38,160 --> 01:14:40,208
Reporting for duty, Sergeant Major.

932
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:42,804
I'd like to bring a couple friends of mine.

933
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:45,729
Colton's team, it's our honour.

934
01:14:46,080 --> 01:14:47,047
You guys take the perimeter.

935
01:14:47,160 --> 01:14:49,003
Flint, Jaye, Snake,
you guys take the flank.

936
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:51,727
Jinx and Storm, Trojan Horse.

937
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:53,970
Zaﬂan will be holding the briefcase.

938
01:14:54,280 --> 01:14:55,884
Storm will be the closest man to him.

939
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,446
But he can't move
until we're all in position.

940
01:14:58,720 --> 01:15:00,165
Everyone keep your eye on the prize.

941
01:15:00,440 --> 01:15:03,439
We secure the football,
we secure the world.

942
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:05,169
Snake, how's all that sound?

943
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:06,647
That's what I thought.

944
01:15:06,760 --> 01:15:07,682
Okay, wait. Hold on a second.

945
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:11,402
We still have enemy armour
here, here, and here.

946
01:15:11,640 --> 01:15:12,721
Right?

947
01:15:13,680 --> 01:15:15,887
These tanks survive, we don't.

948
01:15:17,640 --> 01:15:19,210
Leave the tanks to me.

949
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:20,767
General?

950
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:21,927
Call me Joe.

951
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:23,890
- Anything I missed?
-No.

952
01:15:24,200 --> 01:15:26,885
Rock solid. My orders?

953
01:15:27,400 --> 01:15:28,322
The President.

954
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:32,009
- Brenda's with my team.
- Roger that.

955
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:34,681
Does Brenda get a vote?

956
01:15:35,400 --> 01:15:36,925
Negative.

957
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:38,567
You need a pen?

958
01:15:39,160 --> 01:15:40,650
I need your help.

959
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:43,561
All right.

960
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:45,570
Let's kick that ass! Hoo-ah!

961
01:15:45,680 --> 01:15:46,727
Hoo-ah!

962
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:55,924
<i>A historic day for the President
of the United States as he meets with...</i>

963
01:15:56,040 --> 01:15:57,849
<i>This afternoon, the President
is meeting with the leaders</i>

964
01:15:57,960 --> 01:15:59,291
<i>of the eight nuclear powers.</i>

965
01:15:59,400 --> 01:16:01,084
<i>Never before
has a President been so bold</i>

966
01:16:01,320 --> 01:16:03,448
<i>to call the leaders
of the world together...</i>

967
01:16:03,560 --> 01:16:05,164
<i>These are unprecedented nuclear talks</i>

968
01:16:05,280 --> 01:16:07,328
<i>that, frankly, most believed
would never happen.</i>

969
01:16:12,760 --> 01:16:15,206
<i>You can bet security is at its highest...</i>

970
01:16:15,560 --> 01:16:19,360
<i>We may be closer to a nuclear-free
world than we have ever been.</i>

971
01:16:19,720 --> 01:16:21,131
I'll say it again.

972
01:16:21,240 --> 01:16:23,846
The world is safer
with a nuclear presence.

973
01:16:24,280 --> 01:16:27,284
I'm sure your electorate will be happy
by our final proposal.

974
01:16:27,720 --> 01:16:30,883
50% reduction by 2016.

975
01:16:33,400 --> 01:16:35,687
There are a lot of leaders in this room.

976
01:16:36,760 --> 01:16:39,604
But only one leader of the free world.

977
01:16:40,120 --> 01:16:41,360
And he,

978
01:16:42,040 --> 01:16:44,088
I, stay with me,

979
01:16:45,080 --> 01:16:49,449
asked you here with the goal
of universal disarmament.

980
01:16:49,960 --> 01:16:51,007
Nuclear zero.

981
01:16:51,960 --> 01:16:55,760
Now, I was prepared
to cajole to get what I want.

982
01:16:56,200 --> 01:16:57,850
I'm now at threaten.

983
01:16:58,920 --> 01:17:03,050
Each of you will clear out
his nuclear closet immediately.

984
01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:07,445
Failure to participate
will be considered an act of war.

985
01:17:08,160 --> 01:17:09,525
You're joking, of course.

986
01:17:09,640 --> 01:17:11,051
This summit is over.

987
01:17:11,160 --> 01:17:12,161
Then this is it.

988
01:17:12,680 --> 01:17:13,761
This is it, boys.

989
01:17:16,160 --> 01:17:18,049
This country is at war.

990
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:22,246
With you and you and you
and you and you and you.

991
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,651
<i>Delta team in position.
Echo, you're a go.</i>

992
01:17:35,240 --> 01:17:37,322
<i>This is Echo. Beginning assault.</i>

993
01:17:40,200 --> 01:17:41,929
The U.S. nuclear arsenal

994
01:17:42,240 --> 01:17:46,450
is capable of destroying
each of your countries 14 times over.

995
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:49,450
Fifteen, in the case of North Korea,
just to be sure.

996
01:17:50,040 --> 01:17:51,530
And all

997
01:17:54,360 --> 01:17:55,600
at the push

998
01:17:56,280 --> 01:17:57,247
of a button.

999
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:13,364
It's true. Yeah!

1000
01:18:13,840 --> 01:18:15,001
Yeah, I pressed it.

1001
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:16,447
You have lost your mind!

1002
01:18:17,200 --> 01:18:18,770
It's all relative.

1003
01:18:21,120 --> 01:18:23,168
You got three minutes to decide.

1004
01:18:23,480 --> 01:18:25,801
- You got next watch?
- Maintain radio silence.

1005
01:18:41,040 --> 01:18:44,647
We cannot, we will not leave
a legacy of acquiescence!

1006
01:18:44,920 --> 01:18:46,365
Bring the briefcase.

1007
01:18:54,120 --> 01:18:55,360
Don't do this!

1008
01:18:55,680 --> 01:18:57,011
There can be no winners!

1009
01:19:01,560 --> 01:19:02,527
High score.

1010
01:19:02,760 --> 01:19:07,084
Let history record
who was responsible for this madness.

1011
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:12,131
Launch.

1012
01:19:30,840 --> 01:19:32,330
Launch.

1013
01:19:50,080 --> 01:19:51,286
Eyes on the Emerald City.

1014
01:19:51,680 --> 01:19:54,411
<i>Jaye and Colton,
you're a go for POTUS.</i>

1015
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:13,882
You all right?

1016
01:20:14,280 --> 01:20:16,009
Yeah. You all right?

1017
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:18,729
My cholesterol's a little high.

1018
01:20:20,840 --> 01:20:22,888
<i>Jaye and General Colton.
Checkpoint neutralised.</i>

1019
01:20:23,400 --> 01:20:24,765
You're on your own.

1020
01:20:36,200 --> 01:20:40,000
Well, the good news is,
no global warming summit next month.

1021
01:20:41,280 --> 01:20:42,520
Unless

1022
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:45,884
one of us cared enough
about his place in history

1023
01:20:46,240 --> 01:20:48,607
to unilaterally disable his warheads.

1024
01:20:50,320 --> 01:20:51,560
You know, in the name of the children.

1025
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:53,570
Any volunteers?

1026
01:20:53,920 --> 01:20:55,490
No? Fine.

1027
01:20:55,800 --> 01:20:56,961
Me.

1028
01:21:09,440 --> 01:21:11,522
Call your people to confirm.

1029
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:13,330
You're a complete lunatic.

1030
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:15,648
Says the man about to destroy Asia.

1031
01:21:16,040 --> 01:21:17,371
Come on,
who's going to follow suit, huh?

1032
01:21:17,640 --> 01:21:20,849
Are you really going to stand by
and watch as Earth is destroyed?

1033
01:21:21,120 --> 01:21:22,201
Abolﬂ

1034
01:21:37,640 --> 01:21:39,529
I figured North Korea for last.

1035
01:21:42,280 --> 01:21:43,930
Got to love the little guy.

1036
01:21:44,600 --> 01:21:45,840
Gentlemen.

1037
01:21:46,200 --> 01:21:48,680
Welcome to a nuclear-free world.

1038
01:21:50,920 --> 01:21:55,369
I want to direct your attention
to live images of your homelands.

1039
01:22:03,320 --> 01:22:05,800
Now, you're looking
at an advanced weapons system

1040
01:22:06,120 --> 01:22:07,645
we call Project Zeus.

1041
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:12,169
There are seven Zeus satellites
orbiting Earth.

1042
01:22:12,640 --> 01:22:16,167
<i>Each satellite contains
10 hollow platinum tubes</i>

1043
01:22:16,360 --> 01:22:18,249
<i>filled with a tungsten rod.</i>

1044
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:21,762
Zeus satellite 1-A approaching London.

1045
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:25,322
Ordnance live and loaded.
Awaiting drop authorisation.

1046
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:29,930
Now, to direct a rod to its target,
we don't launch it or fire it.

1047
01:22:30,280 --> 01:22:31,247
We drop it!

1048
01:22:36,320 --> 01:22:38,607
Gravity does the rest.

1049
01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:42,200
Observe.

1050
01:22:45,800 --> 01:22:47,848
Satellite 1-A.
We have remote launch authorisation.

1051
01:22:48,040 --> 01:22:49,769
Three, two, one,

1052
01:22:50,120 --> 01:22:51,121
drop.

1053
01:22:57,280 --> 01:23:00,124
A rod touches down
eight times faster than a bullet.

1054
01:23:00,520 --> 01:23:03,808
And with a force significantly greater
than a nuclear warhead.

1055
01:23:06,440 --> 01:23:07,965
None of the fallout.

1056
01:23:08,840 --> 01:23:10,410
All of the fun.

1057
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:29,922
You will have to answer for this.

1058
01:23:30,440 --> 01:23:32,647
To your Congress, your courts.

1059
01:23:33,080 --> 01:23:36,323
Correction,
they will have to answer to me.

1060
01:23:36,600 --> 01:23:38,329
What is it you want?

1061
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:42,889
I want it all.

1062
01:24:02,840 --> 01:24:06,890
The Cobra revolution has begun.

1063
01:24:07,720 --> 01:24:12,328
By pressing that button,
Zaﬂan initiated an auto-drop sequence.

1064
01:24:13,400 --> 01:24:16,006
My Zeus satellites
are moving into position

1065
01:24:16,160 --> 01:24:17,844
over your six remaining countries.

1066
01:24:18,280 --> 01:24:20,886
Satellites 2-A through 7-A
en route to targets.

1067
01:24:21,720 --> 01:24:24,326
The same button that begins this
can end it.

1068
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:26,889
But I only press it for a price.

1069
01:24:27,880 --> 01:24:30,087
Total allegiance.

1070
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:39,890
<i>Block, secure the perimeter!</i>

1071
01:24:57,200 --> 01:25:01,171
Nothing matters now but the briefcase!
Keep it out of Joe hands!

1072
01:25:05,480 --> 01:25:06,686
Firefly has the case!

1073
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:27,443
Head for the door, now! Go, go!

1074
01:25:33,120 --> 01:25:34,849
Satellites en route to targets.

1075
01:25:35,040 --> 01:25:36,929
Beginning command protocols.

1076
01:26:25,240 --> 01:26:27,049
<i>On your six, Cobra two!</i>

1077
01:26:35,680 --> 01:26:38,331
Cobra one, Cobra one,
I need eyes on! Eyes on!

1078
01:26:52,200 --> 01:26:53,929
Commander, I have the case.

1079
01:26:54,440 --> 01:26:55,805
<i>We are still a go.</i>

1080
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:57,570
How long till drop?

1081
01:26:57,920 --> 01:27:00,491
On schedule, Commander.
Five minutes to live fire.

1082
01:27:00,840 --> 01:27:01,762
Final targeting to begin shortly.

1083
01:27:01,960 --> 01:27:04,645
Zeus satellites 4 and <i>7</i> in position.

1084
01:27:36,680 --> 01:27:38,250
- What was that?
- Shut up.

1085
01:27:40,760 --> 01:27:42,000
- Ray?
- Yes, sir.

1086
01:27:42,120 --> 01:27:43,531
Check the door. Give me a sit rep.

1087
01:27:43,640 --> 01:27:44,607
I'm on it.

1088
01:27:59,280 --> 01:28:00,566
You two secure the entrance.

1089
01:28:21,480 --> 01:28:23,130
- What are you doing?
- Let's go. We're out of here.

1090
01:28:24,360 --> 01:28:26,089
Stand down. I'm gonna shoot him!

1091
01:28:27,080 --> 01:28:28,491
I said stand down!

1092
01:28:30,120 --> 01:28:33,329
Be a good G.l. Joe and drop the gun.
We're walking out of here.

1093
01:28:33,760 --> 01:28:35,171
I will shoot him in the head.
Do you understand me?

1094
01:28:35,400 --> 01:28:37,050
You're not listening, are you?
Put the gun down!

1095
01:28:37,240 --> 01:28:38,241
Drop <i>m.</i>

1096
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:46,240
Easy, easy.

1097
01:28:47,200 --> 01:28:48,486
Put some pressure on it.

1098
01:28:48,720 --> 01:28:50,085
General Colton.

1099
01:28:50,440 --> 01:28:51,885
- It's good to see you.
- Good to see you.

1100
01:28:52,160 --> 01:28:53,969
- Sorry, Mr President.
- No, it's fine.

1101
01:28:54,280 --> 01:28:55,520
Come on. Let's move.

1102
01:28:55,840 --> 01:28:56,807
Here we go.

1103
01:28:57,320 --> 01:28:59,641
Roadblock, POTUS secure.
No casualties.

1104
01:29:02,240 --> 01:29:03,162
<i>Roger that, Jaye.</i>

1105
01:29:10,600 --> 01:29:12,489
You betrayed the Hard Master.

1106
01:29:15,400 --> 01:29:16,640
<i>And made me</i> what I <i>am.</i>

1107
01:29:17,120 --> 01:29:18,121
Yep.

1108
01:29:18,560 --> 01:29:20,050
Yeah, I can see that was wrong.

1109
01:29:44,160 --> 01:29:46,891
<i>We need eyes
on Fireﬂy and Cobra ASAP.</i>

1110
01:29:56,040 --> 01:29:57,610
Courtyard clear. No sign of him.

1111
01:30:01,880 --> 01:30:05,930
Zeus satellites 2, 3, 5, and 6
are locked on target. France,

1112
01:30:06,480 --> 01:30:07,766
Russia, North Korea,

1113
01:30:08,200 --> 01:30:11,044
<i>India, Israel, China.</i>

1114
01:30:32,040 --> 01:30:32,962
Block.

1115
01:30:33,880 --> 01:30:35,041
<i>Cobra Commanders bugging out.</i>

1116
01:30:35,240 --> 01:30:36,480
No sign of Firefly.

1117
01:30:37,880 --> 01:30:39,120
I've got him.

1118
01:30:49,840 --> 01:30:52,207
Targets acquired.
Ordnance live and loading.

1119
01:30:52,920 --> 01:30:54,888
Zeus 4 is ready to fire. Hatch is open.

1120
01:31:08,120 --> 01:31:10,407
- Get him!
- Take him out!

1121
01:32:06,920 --> 01:32:08,604
You want that case?

1122
01:32:08,960 --> 01:32:10,689
You're gonna have to come through me.

1123
01:32:11,080 --> 01:32:12,491
Oh, yeah.

1124
01:32:13,800 --> 01:32:14,722
That's right.

1125
01:32:27,800 --> 01:32:30,485
<i>All satellites have begun load
for final countdown.</i>

1126
01:33:24,760 --> 01:33:26,000
<i>Launch codes confirmed.</i>

1127
01:33:27,680 --> 01:33:28,966
Ten seconds to live fire.

1128
01:33:30,520 --> 01:33:31,442
<i>Ten.</i>

1129
01:33:31,800 --> 01:33:32,961
<i>Nine.</i>

1130
01:33:33,160 --> 01:33:34,400
<i>Eight.</i>

1131
01:33:34,760 --> 01:33:36,967
<i>Seven. Six.</i>

1132
01:33:37,360 --> 01:33:38,327
<i>Five.</i>

1133
01:33:38,480 --> 01:33:39,686
<i>Four.</i>

1134
01:33:39,840 --> 01:33:41,126
<i>Three.</i>

1135
01:33:41,240 --> 01:33:42,480
<i>Two.</i>

1136
01:33:59,080 --> 01:34:00,650
Threat terminated.

1137
01:34:02,120 --> 01:34:05,124
Team Bravo, perimeter has been
cleared and secured.

1138
01:35:04,200 --> 01:35:05,850
<i>Joe Command to covert operations.</i>

1139
01:35:05,960 --> 01:35:07,291
<i>We have control of the perimeter.</i>

1140
01:35:08,040 --> 01:35:09,769
<i>Medical personnel are on the scene.</i>

1141
01:35:09,880 --> 01:35:11,041
<i>All Joes are accounted for.</i>

1142
01:35:11,160 --> 01:35:12,605
<i>We're going home.</i>

1143
01:35:23,040 --> 01:35:25,122
<i>The President is back safe
in the Oval Office today,</i>

1144
01:35:25,240 --> 01:35:27,447
<i>presiding over</i> a <i>ceremony
honouring the G.I. Joes.</i>

1145
01:35:27,560 --> 01:35:31,007
<i>With the world back in order,
rebuilding has begun around the world.</i>

1146
01:35:31,320 --> 01:35:33,448
<i>Those who stand beside us,</i>

1147
01:35:33,640 --> 01:35:36,246
<i>the world knows them as Joes.</i>

1148
01:35:37,240 --> 01:35:39,720
<i>We know them as heroes.</i>

1149
01:35:44,600 --> 01:35:45,840
Jinx.

1150
01:35:46,520 --> 01:35:48,010
Welcome to the Joes.

1151
01:35:49,320 --> 01:35:50,287
Flint.

1152
01:35:50,720 --> 01:35:51,687
Great job.

1153
01:35:56,120 --> 01:35:58,487
Captain Jaye Burnett.

1154
01:36:02,920 --> 01:36:04,251
I served with your father.

1155
01:36:07,360 --> 01:36:09,328
He'd be very proud of you.

1156
01:36:19,680 --> 01:36:22,524
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, the G.l. Joes.</i>

1157
01:36:32,200 --> 01:36:33,247
Hey.

1158
01:36:36,800 --> 01:36:39,121
For when you find Cobra Commander.

1159
01:36:47,640 --> 01:36:49,051
Where can we find you, General?

1160
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:51,411
Just need my orders.

1161
01:36:51,840 --> 01:36:53,410
You know, we'd make a hell of a team.
