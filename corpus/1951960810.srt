00:00:12,145 --> 00:00:14,579
<i>My name is Alissa Vincent.</i>

2
00:00:14,647 --> 00:00:17,115
<i>I may be the sole survivor.</i>

3
00:00:17,183 --> 00:00:19,048
<i>We encountered an alien life form.</i>

4
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:21,246
<i>They have taken over</i>
<i>the bodies of the crew.</i>

5
00:00:22,722 --> 00:00:25,213
<i>The colony was lost.</i>

6
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:27,919
<i>My team is dead.</i>

7
00:00:27,994 --> 00:00:32,522
<i>It is my belief that the artifact</i>
<i>we discovered on the surface</i>

8
00:00:32,599 --> 00:00:35,067
<i>is somehow responsible.</i>

9
00:00:35,135 --> 00:00:37,126
<i>If you find this recording,</i>

10
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:40,138
<i>the</i> Ishimura <i>and the artifact</i>

11
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:42,037
<i>must be destroyed.</i>

12
00:00:42,108 --> 00:00:43,973
<i>- must be destroyed.</i>

13
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:46,410
<i>- must be destroyed.</i>

14
00:01:27,053 --> 00:01:29,544
[whirring, beeping]

15
00:01:29,622 --> 00:01:30,680
30 meters.

16
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:34,090
Whatever it is, it's just up ahead.

17
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,754
Any idea what it is?

18
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:37,990
Not a clue.

19
00:01:38,064 --> 00:01:40,931
This planet is ripe
with unusual seismic activity.

20
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,900
Protocol says we're required
to check it out,

21
00:01:42,969 --> 00:01:44,163
so we're checking it out.

22
00:01:44,237 --> 00:01:47,229
All right, heads up.
We've got a small impact crater ahead.

23
00:01:47,307 --> 00:01:48,899
Watch your footing.

24
00:02:16,002 --> 00:02:17,697
Toggle your flares.

25
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:20,204
Let's take a look
at what we're dealing with.

26
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:25,037
[Man] There's something strange
about these walls.

27
00:02:25,111 --> 00:02:27,045
There's evidence of chemical weathering.

28
00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:36,252
And there's symmetrical
45 degree scarring on these walls.

29
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:41,421
Anybody else think these marks
resemble the ones made by an E-34?

30
00:02:42,562 --> 00:02:45,497
Well, I would if we weren't
several million light years from home

31
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:47,260
on a previously unexplored rock.

32
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:50,791
Yet, we have E-34 drag lines as well.

33
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:54,636
Nobody's used an E-34
elephant drilling rig in over 150 years.

34
00:02:54,707 --> 00:02:57,403
Hell, I've only seen them in books.

35
00:02:58,645 --> 00:03:00,135
I'm going to radio the colony.

36
00:03:00,213 --> 00:03:03,182
Somebody's been messing around out here.

37
00:03:03,249 --> 00:03:06,912
Jen, you're going
to want to look at this.

38
00:03:27,273 --> 00:03:29,241
Oh, my God.

39
00:03:30,643 --> 00:03:32,508
We've got to call this in.

40
00:03:37,016 --> 00:03:38,347
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>This is Aegis Colony.</i>

41
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:39,646
<i>Artifact discovered.</i>

42
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:42,187
<i>Could be a second Marker.</i>
<i>Please advise.</i>

43
00:03:42,255 --> 00:03:44,348
<i>[Man #2]</i>
<i>Unitologist Church has been notified.</i>

44
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:46,051
<i>They're awaiting specs.</i>

45
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:49,390
<i>Earth, you should have an image.</i>
<i>Files are uploaded.</i>

46
00:03:49,462 --> 00:03:52,260
<i>My God, we've found it.</i>

47
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:55,825
<i>Launch of</i> Ishimura <i>on schedule.</i>

48
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:57,460
<i>Arrival on station: one month.</i>

49
00:03:57,537 --> 00:04:00,028
<i>Prepare the artifact</i>
<i>for transfer to the ship.</i>

50
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:06,208
<i>Artifact removed from discovery site.</i>
<i>Strange interference generated.</i>

51
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:09,009
<i>Unexplained violence</i>
<i>reported among colonists.</i>

52
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:11,107
<i>Planet security handling it.</i>

53
00:04:11,184 --> 00:04:14,415
<i>Artifact is quarantined</i>
<i>and ready for removal.</i>

54
00:04:14,487 --> 00:04:15,511
<i>Acknowledged.</i>

55
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:18,921
Ishimura <i>will be on station</i>
<i>and ready for transport shortly.</i>

56
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:22,723
<i>Our expert, Dr. Kyne, is aboard</i>
<i>and will coordinate the experiments.</i>

57
00:04:22,795 --> 00:04:24,990
<i>Altman be praised.</i>

58
00:05:07,707 --> 00:05:09,038
That's odd.

59
00:05:09,108 --> 00:05:11,474
What the hell's been
going wrong down there?

60
00:05:11,544 --> 00:05:13,808
<i>Chief Vincent,</i>
<i>you're wanted on the bridge.</i>

61
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,040
What's up?

62
00:05:15,114 --> 00:05:16,706
<i>The captain is ready to see you.</i>

63
00:05:16,783 --> 00:05:17,841
On my way.

64
00:05:17,917 --> 00:05:19,942
Audio off.

65
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:21,577
About fucking time.

66
00:05:43,543 --> 00:05:44,703
Lights out.

67
00:05:56,923 --> 00:06:01,917
So I tell her, artifact or not,
in the grand scheme of things,

68
00:06:01,994 --> 00:06:04,155
we are all alone out here.

69
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:09,293
Might be a long time ago the universe
had all kinds of life, but now...

70
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:10,529
You know what I think?

71
00:06:10,603 --> 00:06:12,332
I think the thing is cursed.

72
00:06:12,405 --> 00:06:14,305
I mean look what's happened
since they found it.

73
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:17,104
I don't remember you getting paid
to think, Jackson.

74
00:06:17,176 --> 00:06:18,973
Now go help secure those gravity tethers.

75
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:20,808
We've got a whole operation
waiting on this thing.

76
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,711
Someone or something

77
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:25,182
put that thing here for a reason,
that's all I know.

78
00:06:26,185 --> 00:06:28,915
It's a good thing no one asked you.

79
00:06:28,988 --> 00:06:30,512
Come on, Collin.

80
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:34,856
You telling me that the thing
ain't creeping the shit out of you?

81
00:06:34,927 --> 00:06:38,363
I mean, the suicides, the murders?

82
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:40,422
Seems like everyone on this rock
is losing their shit.

83
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,697
This is deep space.
Weird shit happens.

84
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:46,136
The faster we do our jobs,
the faster we get home.

85
00:06:47,206 --> 00:06:49,299
Your wife discovered it
and she still has no theory

86
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:50,967
about where it came from?

87
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:56,181
The Unitologists seem to have an idea
that this is what created us,

88
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:57,910
or something stupid like that.

89
00:06:57,984 --> 00:07:00,953
Jen is a geologist and a site surveyor,

90
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:05,650
not an anthropologist,
archeologist, or Unitologist.

91
00:07:05,725 --> 00:07:08,023
- [door whirring]
- Besides, she hasn't been well.

92
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:10,722
That's more the reason to get this thing
aboard ship and go home.

93
00:07:10,797 --> 00:07:13,197
<i>[Man on radio] What the hell
is going on down there, Barrow?</i>

94
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:15,496
<i>We've got a timeline</i>
<i>and a planet to crack.</i>

95
00:07:15,568 --> 00:07:17,593
Everything is fine, <i>Ishimura.</i>

96
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:21,231
Securing the last anchor now.
We'll be moving out momentarily.

97
00:07:36,556 --> 00:07:40,185
What secrets do you have for us?

98
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:41,954
<i>Dr. Kyne...</i>

99
00:07:42,028 --> 00:07:43,893
<i>you're needed in the med lab.</i>

100
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:45,453
On the way.

101
00:07:58,845 --> 00:08:01,336
[men chattering]

102
00:08:02,915 --> 00:08:04,576
Steady now.

103
00:08:15,628 --> 00:08:17,459
- Captain.
- You wanted to see me?

104
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:21,091
As chief of security on this ship,
I would like to severely protest

105
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,657
bringing the artifact aboard.

106
00:08:22,735 --> 00:08:24,726
You've already made your protests heard,

107
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:26,669
and I have already taken them
into account, thank you.

108
00:08:26,739 --> 00:08:28,331
Captain.

109
00:08:28,407 --> 00:08:31,433
You've given me
the incident counts for the colony,

110
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:35,311
and I say that this colony has been
in operation for two and a half years.

111
00:08:35,381 --> 00:08:38,441
That much time in deep space
is inherently dangerous.

112
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:42,249
And the people attracted
to this line of work are, too.

113
00:08:42,321 --> 00:08:44,755
You're forgetting one thing, Captain.

114
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:46,985
A spike in serious violent incidents

115
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:48,856
have been reported over the last week.

116
00:08:48,928 --> 00:08:52,364
We pulled that thing up a week ago.

117
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:55,457
I have my orders and you have yours.

118
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:56,866
Just tell me this.

119
00:08:56,936 --> 00:08:59,336
Why is this thing so important?

120
00:08:59,405 --> 00:09:02,203
Alissa, don't fight me on this.

121
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:06,609
Once Kyne has studied the Marker,
you can have your team run a full analysis.

122
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:09,810
Yes, sir.

123
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:41,139
Gravity tethers full tension
and stable, Captain.

124
00:09:41,213 --> 00:09:42,646
All systems are go, sir.

125
00:09:42,715 --> 00:09:44,342
All right, Mr. White.

126
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:45,782
Pop the cork.

127
00:10:54,186 --> 00:10:56,552
[monitor beeping]

128
00:10:57,556 --> 00:10:59,683
[grunting]

129
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:01,624
I had to kill.
You understand?

130
00:11:01,694 --> 00:11:04,686
They need bodies.
They need us to turn.

131
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:06,698
All right, Mr. Leggio.

132
00:11:06,766 --> 00:11:08,825
Sometimes the sedatives
cause hallucinations.

133
00:11:08,901 --> 00:11:10,596
Just relax, okay?

134
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,605
Why is this man still awake?
I told you to give him a sedative.

135
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:16,972
I did. 500 cc's, just like you ordered.

136
00:11:17,043 --> 00:11:18,237
He's fighting it.

137
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:19,299
You don't hear that?

138
00:11:19,378 --> 00:11:22,108
My God, make it stop!

139
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:25,981
[groaning]

140
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:30,219
Kill me!

141
00:11:31,624 --> 00:11:34,855
[beeping increases]

142
00:11:38,798 --> 00:11:40,390
Nurse, help me restrain him!

143
00:11:40,466 --> 00:11:44,095
Kill me! Just fucking kill me!

144
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:46,798
Hold him still, Nurse.

145
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,748
That should do it.

146
00:11:56,816 --> 00:11:59,842
[beeping decreases]

147
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:01,614
What the hell just happened?

148
00:12:01,687 --> 00:12:04,747
I've never seen someone resist
a sedative of that quantity.

149
00:12:04,824 --> 00:12:06,382
It's not possible.

150
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:08,893
I have no idea.

151
00:12:08,961 --> 00:12:11,759
Two weeks ago, this man
was healthy and mentally stable.

152
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:14,629
Then out of nowhere,
he kills two members of his dig team.

153
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,964
None of this makes much sense.

154
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:19,971
Some kind of toxin, maybe.

155
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:21,438
Something in the colony?

156
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:22,701
Maybe.

157
00:12:22,775 --> 00:12:26,472
This rash of unusual cases
coming from the planet puzzles me.

158
00:12:26,545 --> 00:12:28,513
I need full blood work done ASAP.

159
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,310
Test for anything and everything.

160
00:12:30,382 --> 00:12:31,371
Yes, Doctor.

161
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:02,345
Good work, people.
She's coming up nicely.

162
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:08,079
- [alarms sounding]
- [rumbling]

163
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,593
Normal electromagnetic surges.

164
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:17,288
The magnetic field of the planet
is bleeding out.

165
00:13:17,363 --> 00:13:19,354
Nothing to worry about.

166
00:13:25,771 --> 00:13:28,706
- [alarm sounds]
- [rumbling]

167
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:45,849
What's happening?

168
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:48,894
I'm not sure.
The entire system is rebooting.

169
00:13:48,961 --> 00:13:50,861
Our power cores are shielded.

170
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:52,090
Yes, I know.

171
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:55,395
Another wave of disruption just broke
from the surface and smacked into us.

172
00:13:55,467 --> 00:13:58,197
It's a temporary glitch,
not an attack, Alissa.

173
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:00,329
Down, girl.

174
00:14:00,406 --> 00:14:03,375
- Asshole.
- Break it up, you two.

175
00:14:03,442 --> 00:14:05,103
Chic, can you raise the colony?

176
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:06,644
Well, things are choppy at best.

177
00:14:06,712 --> 00:14:08,703
We've lost 40% of the comlink signal.

178
00:14:08,781 --> 00:14:10,112
Can you isolate the problem?

179
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:12,241
I've never seen interference like this.

180
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:17,153
I have, when I was a pilot back Earth-side
and my radar was being jammed.

181
00:14:17,223 --> 00:14:20,215
You think this is intentionally
directed at us?

182
00:14:20,292 --> 00:14:23,193
That's a dead planet
and we're the only people out here.

183
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:26,493
How in the hell is something
intentionally jamming us?

184
00:14:26,565 --> 00:14:28,032
I'm just saying what it looks like.

185
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:31,433
It could just be excess magnetic feedback
from the planet crack.

186
00:14:31,503 --> 00:14:33,300
Chick, get me Foreman Barrow.

187
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:35,567
I want to know what's happening down there.

188
00:14:35,641 --> 00:14:37,040
<i>Captain, I don't know</i>
<i>if you can hear me,</i>

189
00:14:37,109 --> 00:14:39,373
<i>but we must have pulled</i>
<i>too closely to the core.</i>

190
00:14:39,445 --> 00:14:41,379
<i>Things are shaking</i>
<i>like a mother down here.</i>

191
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:42,436
<i>We've got heavy interference.</i>

192
00:14:42,514 --> 00:14:44,379
Over.

193
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:47,146
You reading me, <i>Ishimura?</i>
Nothing.

194
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:49,915
<i>Barrow, come in.</i>

195
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:51,718
<i>Barrow.</i>

196
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:54,452
<i>Barrow, this is the captain.</i>
<i>Report in.</i>

197
00:14:54,526 --> 00:14:56,460
<i>Barrow.</i>

198
00:14:56,528 --> 00:14:57,927
[roaring]

199
00:14:57,997 --> 00:14:59,259
[groaning]

200
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:06,828
- The planet is pushing back.
- What?

201
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:09,568
Something I read about the danger
of harvesting planets.

202
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:12,076
You got another line of work
you're looking to get into?

203
00:15:12,144 --> 00:15:15,375
It says that the planet cracking procedure
is extremely dangerous

204
00:15:15,447 --> 00:15:16,812
to the overall harmony of the universe.

205
00:15:16,882 --> 00:15:20,249
What a bunch of Unitologist bullshit.

206
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:22,753
The only planets we ever found
in all of space are dead.

207
00:15:22,821 --> 00:15:24,220
Earth was a fluke.

208
00:15:46,245 --> 00:15:48,145
It's a ghost town in here.

209
00:15:48,213 --> 00:15:50,408
Where the hell is everybody?

210
00:16:07,232 --> 00:16:09,723
I'm going to check on Jen.
Catch you later.

211
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:21,009
[woman screams in distance]

212
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,945

213
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:25,942
[woman screams]

214
00:16:26,018 --> 00:16:29,419
[creature roaring]

215
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:40,824
[roaring continues]

216
00:16:42,568 --> 00:16:45,560
[panting]

217
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:55,938
Jen?

218
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,812
Where are you?

219
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:20,163
What the fuck?

220
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,502
These symbols are the same as...

221
00:17:42,628 --> 00:17:46,155
Honey, what are you doing?

222
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:48,096
They want our bodies.

223
00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:51,068
This is mine...

224
00:17:51,136 --> 00:17:55,732
my flesh, my bone, and my blood.

225
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,372
No!

226
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:14,481
No, no, no!

227
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,584
Jen?

228
00:18:15,661 --> 00:18:19,119
Oh, baby.
Fuck. Why?

229
00:18:19,198 --> 00:18:21,189
Jen.

230
00:18:31,977 --> 00:18:35,743
My last analysis of the Marker
suggests a psychosomatic energy field

231
00:18:35,814 --> 00:18:37,611
unlike anything I've ever seen.

232
00:18:37,683 --> 00:18:39,776
This interference is rising from the planet.

233
00:18:39,852 --> 00:18:41,479
The Marker's not the problem here.

234
00:18:41,553 --> 00:18:43,180
I know, it... it's just...

235
00:18:43,255 --> 00:18:44,950
Just what, Doctor?

236
00:18:45,023 --> 00:18:48,254
- [computer beeping]
- Something's not right.

237
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:49,851
Communications just came back up.

238
00:18:49,928 --> 00:18:52,624
I'm reacquiring the colony's signal.

239
00:18:52,698 --> 00:18:56,725
We're pulling scattershot low-res images
from the personal cams.

240
00:18:58,704 --> 00:19:00,797
- [gasps]
- What the...

241
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:02,807
Put it on the main monitors.

242
00:19:16,088 --> 00:19:19,114
We need to send a security team
down there now, Captain.

243
00:19:19,191 --> 00:19:21,682
Captain, I'm getting
multiple flat lines across the board.

244
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,127
[alarms beeping]

245
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:29,666
Good God,
they're being slaughtered.

246
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:32,795
- By what?
- I'm going down there now.

247
00:19:32,871 --> 00:19:34,736
Not until I know what the hell is happening.

248
00:19:34,806 --> 00:19:37,570
Chic, get someone on the com.
I want a sit-rep ASAP.

249
00:19:42,648 --> 00:19:44,809
[panting]

250
00:20:11,977 --> 00:20:13,501
Hold on, baby.

251
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:15,444
We're going home.

252
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:17,675
[engines whirring]

253
00:20:38,303 --> 00:20:39,793
I've raised one of the dig crews.

254
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:42,930
Ishimura, <i>can you hear us?</i>

255
00:20:43,008 --> 00:20:46,409
<i>Something's down here,</i>
<i>killing everyone.</i>

256
00:20:46,478 --> 00:20:48,173
<i>My dig crew has changed.</i>

257
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:51,375
<i>I think there's something down...</i>
<i>Help us, God damn it!</i>

258
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:53,645
This is <i>Ishimura.</i>
We are reading you.

259
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:55,084
Who is killing everyone?

260
00:20:55,153 --> 00:20:57,781
<i>- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!</i>
<i>- [creature roaring]</i>

261
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:03,027
Dig team, come in.
This is <i>Ishimura,</i> come in. Over.

262
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:05,222
Start scanning frequencies.

263
00:21:06,732 --> 00:21:08,393
Don't fuck with me right now.

264
00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:10,594
Get on the horn and get me the colony.

265
00:21:12,537 --> 00:21:15,301
Captain, we need to call for help.

266
00:21:15,374 --> 00:21:17,638
We don't have the forces
to protect the ship.

267
00:21:17,709 --> 00:21:20,371
I don't need to remind you
that this is a restricted system,

268
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:22,413
and we're not supposed to be here.

269
00:21:22,481 --> 00:21:23,505
You don't.

270
00:21:23,582 --> 00:21:25,482
But the circumstances have changed.

271
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:26,744
My orders haven't.

272
00:21:26,818 --> 00:21:28,581
Then at least let's contact the church.

273
00:21:28,654 --> 00:21:30,645
- They must know about...
- About what?

274
00:21:36,862 --> 00:21:40,662
The effects of the Marker are like nothing
documented in the religious texts.

275
00:21:40,732 --> 00:21:42,563
And your crew is being wiped out
as we speak.

276
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:46,468
I have a feeling that we have at least
something very dangerous down there,

277
00:21:46,538 --> 00:21:48,096
and we need guidance.

278
00:21:48,173 --> 00:21:50,698
- Do you think they know?
- Who?

279
00:21:50,776 --> 00:21:52,073
The crew.

280
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:55,204
Most of the key officers
are sympathetic to the church.

281
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,544
Maybe a third of the crew
are with the church. Why?

282
00:21:57,616 --> 00:22:02,815
We're going to abandon the colony
and return the Marker to Earth.

283
00:22:02,888 --> 00:22:04,651
It's the only thing to do.

284
00:22:04,723 --> 00:22:06,987
I cannot afford a mutiny on my ship.

285
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:09,027
Sir, I need to take a team down there.

286
00:22:09,094 --> 00:22:11,358
At the very least we need to know
what we're dealing with.

287
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:14,194
Denied. No one is allowed
on or off the colony.

288
00:22:14,266 --> 00:22:16,427
You're condemning innocent people.

289
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:19,197
You want me to put the entire ship at risk?

290
00:22:19,271 --> 00:22:21,000
Is that your brilliant idea?

291
00:22:21,073 --> 00:22:23,507
Captain Matthius,
we've got an incoming shuttle.

292
00:22:23,575 --> 00:22:25,042
Just picked her up on radar.
She's close.

293
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:26,543
Lock the bay doors on every level.

294
00:22:26,611 --> 00:22:27,737
They're survivors.

295
00:22:27,813 --> 00:22:29,872
Maybe they can tell us
what's happening down there.

296
00:22:29,948 --> 00:22:33,185
Do what I say, and do it now.

297
00:22:38,223 --> 00:22:40,316
<i>[Man on radio]</i>
<i>Shuttle Seven, this is the</i> Ishimura.

298
00:22:40,392 --> 00:22:43,054
<i>You are ordered to return</i>
<i>to the surface immediately.</i>

299
00:22:43,128 --> 00:22:44,117
<i>Do you read me?</i>

300
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:46,687
<i>You cannot land on board the</i> Ishimura.

301
00:22:46,765 --> 00:22:49,131
<i>- Over.</i>
- Fuck you, <i>Ishimura.</i>

302
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:51,635
Landing, crashing, or shot down.
Pick one.

303
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:53,762
But there's no way in hell we're going back.

304
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,049
[roars]

305
00:23:26,204 --> 00:23:28,764
Captain, the shuttle just
slipped through Bay 17

306
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,535
before we could secure the doors.

307
00:23:30,609 --> 00:23:31,837
Get down there now.

308
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:34,105
Arrest everyone on board that shuttle
and quarantine them.

309
00:23:34,179 --> 00:23:37,273
You sure you don't want me
to shoot them first?

310
00:23:42,053 --> 00:23:44,453

311
00:23:55,233 --> 00:23:57,724
[shuttle hissing]

312

Eyes up, people.

313
00:24:09,681 --> 00:24:11,945
What exactly are we
dealing with here, Vincent?

314
00:24:12,017 --> 00:24:15,180
Asked as if I had a fucking clue.

315
00:24:23,995 --> 00:24:26,156
Clear right.

316
00:24:26,231 --> 00:24:27,755
Clear left.

317
00:24:29,334 --> 00:24:33,134
Jesus, what the hell happened here?

318
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:38,936
There's a hell of a lot of blood,
but no bodies.

319
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:40,534
Sounds like one of your parties.

320
00:24:40,612 --> 00:24:41,601
Or your sex life.

321
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,908
Cut the chatter, people.

322
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:44,573
This thing didn't crash itself.

323
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:48,585
If someone was piloting this bird,
they ain't here.

324
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:49,847
Blood trails.

325
00:24:52,357 --> 00:24:54,188
Someone got off this shuttle.

326
00:24:54,259 --> 00:24:55,692
Where the hell are they?

327
00:24:59,264 --> 00:25:00,788
We're moving out.

328
00:25:03,635 --> 00:25:05,933

00:26:03,762 --> 00:26:06,993
No. No.

[roaring]

335
00:27:13,031 --> 00:27:14,623
You don't look well.

336
00:27:14,699 --> 00:27:16,098
Vincent's team has secured the dock.

337
00:27:16,167 --> 00:27:18,101
There's no sign of the shuttle crew.

338
00:27:18,169 --> 00:27:19,796
They're beginning a search of the ship.

339
00:27:19,871 --> 00:27:21,429
- And...
- And what?

340
00:27:21,506 --> 00:27:23,872
We've lost all contact with the colony.

341
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:28,440
I want you to check on the artifact.
Make sure it's secure.

342
00:27:28,513 --> 00:27:30,777
We are in over our heads.

343
00:27:30,849 --> 00:27:35,411
You need to contact Earth and find out
what our next course of action should be.

344
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:38,479
I think this is a test of our faith.

345
00:27:38,556 --> 00:27:39,545
What?

346
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:43,794
Nothing.

347
00:27:43,862 --> 00:27:46,023
Just get down there, Doctor.

348
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:55,404
Get back to your stations.

349
00:27:55,473 --> 00:27:57,168
We have a right to see it.

350
00:27:57,242 --> 00:27:58,539
You can't lock it away.

351
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:00,976
It's a holy relic.
We have the right.

352
00:28:01,046 --> 00:28:03,514
Clear this area immediately.

353
00:28:04,983 --> 00:28:06,678
This is a secure area,

354
00:28:06,751 --> 00:28:09,618
and Captain Matthius
wants the artifact left alone.

355
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:12,156
[crowd clamoring]

356
00:28:12,223 --> 00:28:13,281
Excuse me.

357
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:15,826
I'd like to talk to them.
l... I think I can help.

358
00:28:15,894 --> 00:28:17,259
Who are you?

359
00:28:17,328 --> 00:28:20,297
Samuel Irons, Engineering Specialist.

360
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:22,799
Are you a rock worshiper, too, Irons?

361
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:26,234
It may be useful to have
one of their own speaking to them.

362
00:28:26,304 --> 00:28:29,364
Your presence might be
misinterpreted as hostile.

363
00:28:29,441 --> 00:28:30,965
This is me being cordial.

364
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:34,035
You want to see hostile?

365
00:28:34,112 --> 00:28:36,080
Let the man speak with them.

366
00:28:36,147 --> 00:28:39,310
All right, play the piper
and lead the flock out of here

367
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:42,319
before someone gets
their nuts stomped on.

368
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:43,376
Thank you.

369
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:48,817
Brothers and sisters,
there will be plenty of time

370
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:52,454
to observe the holy relic
when we return to Earth.

371
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:54,657
The church must first interpret the markings

372
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:57,634
if we are to be enlightened by their words.

373
00:28:57,702 --> 00:29:03,004
Interfering with the captain's orders
will not help resolve our current crisis.

374
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:06,339
Right now we must pray
for our fellow pilgrims

375
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:10,142
on the surface of the planet
whose lives may be in danger.

376
00:29:10,215 --> 00:29:15,653
Set the example that we Unitologists
are not hysterical fanatics.

377
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:19,247
We respect the orders of our captain.

378
00:29:26,231 --> 00:29:27,664
See?

379
00:29:27,732 --> 00:29:30,963
They are reasonable people
when not confronted by violence

380
00:29:31,035 --> 00:29:32,662
and threats of arrest.

381
00:29:32,737 --> 00:29:35,763
Oh, perhaps in light of my help...

382
00:29:37,175 --> 00:29:40,406
You'll get your chance
to see it in due time.

383
00:29:40,478 --> 00:29:42,708
I understand.

384
00:30:05,103 --> 00:30:06,365
[snarls]

385
00:30:28,026 --> 00:30:29,357
metal clatters]

386
00:30:32,297 --> 00:30:34,060
[chuckles]

387
00:30:34,132 --> 00:30:35,599
Hey.

388
00:30:41,306 --> 00:30:43,035
What the fuck is going on?

389
00:30:43,107 --> 00:30:45,905
I count 15 sets of footprints,
give or take.

390
00:30:48,112 --> 00:30:51,343
The log says there were 20 corpses
set for chryo-storage.

391
00:30:51,416 --> 00:30:53,509
Maybe they had a miraculous recovery.

392
00:30:53,585 --> 00:30:55,678
Here's a crazy idea.

393
00:30:55,753 --> 00:30:56,879
Don't say it, Dobbs.

394
00:30:56,955 --> 00:30:58,786
Hey, I don't mind shooting
the living dead

395
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:00,324
as long as I get
to shoot something.

396
00:31:04,963 --> 00:31:06,521
I've got one.

397
00:31:11,569 --> 00:31:15,300
I'm no doctor, but it looks like
something's been chewing on him.

398
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:17,307
This shit is getting weirder
by the second.

399
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:18,967
Sounds like a date with Shen.

400
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:20,442
Fuck you, rookie.

401
00:31:20,511 --> 00:31:23,878
Has it occurred to you jokers that
whatever did this could still be in here?

402
00:31:23,948 --> 00:31:26,508
I'm going to call this in.
Stay sharp.

403
00:31:27,819 --> 00:31:30,686
Security Chief Vincent to bridge.
Come in, over.

404
00:31:30,755 --> 00:31:33,383
<i>This is Captain Matthius.</i>
<i>Give me a sit-rep Vincent.</i>

405
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:40,722
Dobbs, look out!

406
00:31:43,635 --> 00:31:45,569
Vincent! Vincent!

407
00:31:48,172 --> 00:31:49,264
Ah, get him off!

408
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:52,275
Give me a hand, God damn it!

409
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:09,821
Shoot this fuck!

410
00:32:24,742 --> 00:32:26,733
[Alissa]
Hold your fire!

411
00:32:38,323 --> 00:32:40,086
<i>Vincent, report!</i>

412
00:32:40,158 --> 00:32:42,149
Dobbs is dying.
We've got to stop the bleeding.

413
00:32:42,226 --> 00:32:44,126
<i>Damn it, Vincent, what is going on?</i>

414
00:32:44,195 --> 00:32:45,685
I've got a man down.

415
00:32:45,763 --> 00:32:47,253
We're in the morgue, A Deck.

416
00:32:47,332 --> 00:32:49,823
We were attacked by something.
Not sure what.

417
00:32:49,901 --> 00:32:52,426
Shit! Shen, look out!

418
00:33:02,714 --> 00:33:04,147
What the fuck was that?

419
00:33:04,215 --> 00:33:05,477
I don't know.
Fuck this shit.

420
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:07,142
Let's get the fuck out of here.

421
00:33:07,218 --> 00:33:09,152
Man up, Shen.
You got a job to do.

422
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:11,085
Dobbs is fucking dead!

423
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:12,349
Get a hold of yourselves.

424
00:33:12,423 --> 00:33:14,550
Whatever these things are,
they're loose on the ship.

425
00:33:14,625 --> 00:33:17,321
Secure this room
and get ready to move.

426
00:33:22,633 --> 00:33:24,294
<i>Vincent to bridge. Over.</i>

427
00:33:24,369 --> 00:33:25,631
I want a report, Vincent.

428
00:33:25,703 --> 00:33:27,136
<i>Something's going on, sir.</i>

429
00:33:27,205 --> 00:33:28,729
<i>Something alien is attacking us.</i>

430
00:33:31,309 --> 00:33:33,504
- We need to talk.
- Not now.

431
00:33:33,578 --> 00:33:36,604
Captain, whatever was on the planet
has made it aboard ship,

432
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:38,649
and it's somehow connected to the Marker.

433
00:33:38,716 --> 00:33:42,345
I think the church may have been mistaken.

434
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:44,581
[steam hissing]

435
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,779
[creature chittering]

436
00:34:10,848 --> 00:34:12,247
[man roaring]

437
00:34:20,925 --> 00:34:23,860
[roaring]

438
00:34:28,433 --> 00:34:31,402
[panting, whimpering]

439
00:34:48,352 --> 00:34:51,048
Sir, I just lost telemetry
on 10 crew members.

440
00:34:51,122 --> 00:34:53,249
Five more just flat lined.

441
00:34:53,324 --> 00:34:55,383
Where are they?

442
00:34:57,595 --> 00:34:58,960
Mess hall, A Deck.

443
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:00,292
Get me a visual.

444
00:35:00,364 --> 00:35:03,822
<i>- [creatures roaring]</i>
<i>- [men screaming]</i>

445
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:13,140
Sound the alarm!

446
00:35:14,178 --> 00:35:16,738
Vincent, get your team
to A Deck mess hall on the double.

447
00:35:16,814 --> 00:35:18,338
On our way.

448
00:35:18,416 --> 00:35:19,883
Get full mags in those weapons.

449
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:22,286
I think we're about to walk
into a world of shit.

450
00:35:51,015 --> 00:35:52,846
Jeez, Shen.

451
00:35:57,021 --> 00:35:58,010
[creatures roars]

452
00:35:58,089 --> 00:35:59,750
Over there.

453
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:04,090
[creatures munching]

454
00:36:24,882 --> 00:36:26,941
Get ready to fire on my command.

455
00:36:38,963 --> 00:36:40,362
Fire!

456
00:37:56,807 --> 00:37:59,037
- [gun clicking]
- Huh?

457
00:38:02,847 --> 00:38:05,714
Get the fuck off.

458
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:09,382
Get it away! Get it away!

459
00:38:09,453 --> 00:38:12,320
Get it away!

460
00:38:22,867 --> 00:38:25,631
[screams]

461
00:39:28,165 --> 00:39:29,427
[gun clicking]

462
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:38,197
Holy shit.

463
00:39:39,477 --> 00:39:40,876
Pendleton.

464
00:39:42,446 --> 00:39:43,970
Who are you?

465
00:39:44,682 --> 00:39:47,515
Samuel Irons, mechanics division.

466
00:39:47,585 --> 00:39:49,644
Thanks for the assist, Irons.

467
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,017
No problem.

468
00:39:51,088 --> 00:39:53,215
These things seem
to handle bullets just fine.

469
00:39:53,324 --> 00:39:55,258
But a couple rips
from this bad boy

470
00:39:55,326 --> 00:39:56,520
and they don't get up.

471
00:39:56,594 --> 00:39:57,720
We've noticed.

472
00:39:57,795 --> 00:39:58,989
Where'd you get that?

473
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:00,894
There's a store room down the hall.

474
00:40:00,965 --> 00:40:02,296
I busted open a crate.

475
00:40:02,366 --> 00:40:04,766
It was a divine discovery
at a time like this,

476
00:40:04,835 --> 00:40:05,995
don't you think?

477
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:07,367
Ah, shit.

478
00:40:07,438 --> 00:40:08,928
You another Unitologist?

479
00:40:09,006 --> 00:40:10,064
Shut it.

480
00:40:10,141 --> 00:40:13,201
Ramirez, Shen,
go grab us some weapons.

481
00:40:15,846 --> 00:40:18,474
Bridge, this is Vincent,
come in. Over.

482
00:40:18,549 --> 00:40:21,575
Shit. Com is down.

483
00:40:21,652 --> 00:40:23,711
I think we should consider
abandoning ship.

484
00:40:23,788 --> 00:40:25,813
If these things have spread,
there's no stopping them.

485
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:28,586
Our job is the safety of the crew.

486
00:40:28,659 --> 00:40:30,889
The way I see it,
we have two options.

487
00:40:30,961 --> 00:40:32,656
Fight or die.

488
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:35,290
We don't have the luxury of running.

489
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:41,137
I've lost contact with the bridge.

490
00:40:41,205 --> 00:40:42,467
We're going to head there now.

491
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:44,474
- [cocks gun]
- Anything gets in our way,

492
00:40:44,542 --> 00:40:46,476
cut first, ask questions later.

493
00:40:46,544 --> 00:40:47,704
Got it?

494
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:50,008
- Got it.
- Got it.

495
00:40:52,216 --> 00:40:55,982
[beeping]

496
00:40:57,087 --> 00:40:59,385
Sir, systems are failing
all over the ship.

497
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:00,981
Shipboard communication
is all but down.

498
00:41:01,058 --> 00:41:03,185
Plot a course for Earth.
We're getting the hell out of here.

499
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:04,386
What?

500
00:41:04,528 --> 00:41:07,292
Lock down any sections of the ship
affected by this disturbance.

501
00:41:07,364 --> 00:41:09,195
I want it contained, do you understand?

502
00:41:09,266 --> 00:41:11,325
We have to get the artifact home.

503
00:41:11,402 --> 00:41:12,699
That is our only mission now.

504
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:15,933
Captain, listen to me.
We're not in control anymore.

505
00:41:16,006 --> 00:41:18,201
I'm not sure we ever were.

506
00:41:18,275 --> 00:41:19,503
What are you talking about?

507
00:41:19,577 --> 00:41:22,205
The artifact, the mission.
It's a trap. It has to be.

508
00:41:22,279 --> 00:41:25,112
We've brought something aboard
that we didn't understand.

509
00:41:25,182 --> 00:41:27,616
Something alien, and it's trying to kill us.

510
00:41:27,685 --> 00:41:29,812
We cannot bring the artifact to Earth.

511
00:41:29,887 --> 00:41:31,548
Have you lost your mind, Doctor?

512
00:41:31,622 --> 00:41:34,420
The holy artifact must be
delivered to the church

513
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:37,518
if humanity is to be delivered
into the welcome arms

514
00:41:37,595 --> 00:41:39,119
of the universal awakening!

515
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:45,867
Keep your voice down.

516
00:41:45,936 --> 00:41:47,369
Don't tell me what to do.

517
00:41:47,438 --> 00:41:50,271
I'm the captain. This is my ship!

518
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:52,605
You are being irrational.
People are dying.

519
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:54,109
We are all in danger!

520
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:56,942
The faithless want to destroy the artifact

521
00:41:57,014 --> 00:41:58,641
because they fear it.

522
00:41:58,716 --> 00:42:00,183
I won't allow it, Kyne.

523
00:42:00,251 --> 00:42:01,513
I will not allow it!

524
00:42:01,585 --> 00:42:03,849
The Marker is making us
paranoid and delusional.

525
00:42:03,921 --> 00:42:05,650
It's the only explanation

526
00:42:05,723 --> 00:42:08,089
for the irrational behavior
that has been plaguing the colony,

527
00:42:08,158 --> 00:42:10,592
the crew, and now the officers.

528
00:42:11,662 --> 00:42:14,995
This is not irrational, Doctor.

529
00:42:15,065 --> 00:42:17,625
This is religious persecution.

530
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:19,396
And I'm not going to allow you,

531
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:21,665
or anyone else, to destroy the artifact.

532
00:42:21,739 --> 00:42:24,435
White, have the doctor restrained!

533
00:42:24,508 --> 00:42:26,499
Sir, he's right.

534
00:42:28,412 --> 00:42:29,902
He's speaking heresy.

535
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:32,380
He's a spy, planted on my ship

536
00:42:32,449 --> 00:42:35,282
to destroy any hope we
have of transcending death.

537
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:38,813
You need to calm down.

538
00:42:42,626 --> 00:42:43,888
I gave you an order, Mr. White!

539
00:42:43,961 --> 00:42:46,361
Nobody cares if you're a Uni, Cap.

540
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:48,694
We just want to get out of this alive!

541
00:42:48,766 --> 00:42:51,257
What is that supposed to mean?

542
00:42:57,775 --> 00:42:59,106
Captain, please.

543
00:42:59,176 --> 00:43:00,541
Let me give you a sedative.

544
00:43:00,611 --> 00:43:02,943
Wait a minute.

545
00:43:03,013 --> 00:43:06,346
You... You're all with him.

546
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:08,214
He's going to poison me, isn't he?

547
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:13,887
Fuck this, he's lost it!

548
00:43:17,061 --> 00:43:19,188
You'll all be arrested for mutiny.

549
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:21,788
He's out of his mind, Kyne.
Give him something.

550
00:43:21,865 --> 00:43:24,129
Get your filthy...

551
00:43:24,201 --> 00:43:25,293
Get off of me!

552
00:43:25,369 --> 00:43:27,667
We have to bring the artifact
back to Earth.

553
00:43:27,738 --> 00:43:29,365
The church needs it.

554
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,169
Kyne, you traitor! You're one of us.

555
00:43:31,241 --> 00:43:33,141
You were sent here by the church,

556
00:43:33,210 --> 00:43:34,677
specifically, to retrieve the Marker.

557
00:43:34,745 --> 00:43:36,508
Just like me!

558
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:38,980
You bastard!

559
00:43:39,049 --> 00:43:40,311
This is a sedative.

560
00:43:40,384 --> 00:43:41,476
Don't fight us.

561
00:43:41,552 --> 00:43:43,713
- It's for your own good.
- Bastard!

562
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:45,584
[screaming]

563
00:43:45,656 --> 00:43:47,248
Get away from me.

564
00:43:47,324 --> 00:43:49,155
Hold his head.

565
00:43:49,226 --> 00:43:50,887
I'm trying.

566
00:44:21,759 --> 00:44:22,851
My God.

567
00:44:22,926 --> 00:44:25,759
Is he...

568
00:44:27,064 --> 00:44:29,692
The sedative must have
punctured his brain.

569
00:44:29,767 --> 00:44:31,462
You killed him, Doc.

570
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:34,194
You all saw it.

571
00:44:34,271 --> 00:44:35,602
He killed the captain.

572
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:37,334
It was an accident.

573
00:44:37,408 --> 00:44:39,000
Arrest the doctor.

574
00:44:39,076 --> 00:44:40,873
[alarm blaring]

575
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:45,607
Launch sequence
for escape procedure's initiated.

576
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:56,220
Who is doing this?

577
00:44:56,293 --> 00:44:57,988
I don't know.

578
00:44:59,863 --> 00:45:01,956
Shuttles 1 through 25
have launched.

579
00:45:07,171 --> 00:45:09,503
The shuttles are all empty.

580
00:45:11,308 --> 00:45:13,367
There is only one thing left to do.

581
00:45:19,717 --> 00:45:20,775
Stop the launches!

582
00:45:20,851 --> 00:45:21,977
I'm trying.

583
00:45:22,052 --> 00:45:23,986
Shuttles 26 through 50
have launched.

584
00:45:24,054 --> 00:45:25,715
That's all of them.

585
00:45:25,789 --> 00:45:27,450
All emergency shuttles are gone.

586
00:45:41,004 --> 00:45:42,869
We need another way
up to the bridge.

587
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:45,807
If there still is a bridge.

588
00:45:52,049 --> 00:45:53,516
There's a utility lift ahead.

589
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:54,949
We could move up to hydroponics

590
00:45:55,018 --> 00:45:56,815
and cross to the bridge from there.

591
00:46:09,566 --> 00:46:11,466
[pounding on door]

592
00:46:22,579 --> 00:46:24,444
Some time today!

593
00:46:25,816 --> 00:46:26,908
I got it.

594
00:46:26,984 --> 00:46:28,042
Get inside.

595
00:46:28,118 --> 00:46:30,109
Ramirez, slow them down.

596
00:46:35,659 --> 00:46:37,991
- [gun clicking]
- I'm out.

597
00:46:39,229 --> 00:46:41,163
Hansen, come on.

598
00:46:55,913 --> 00:46:57,642
What happened back there?

599
00:46:57,714 --> 00:46:59,409
I don't know what you mean.

600
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:00,643
You froze up.

601
00:47:00,717 --> 00:47:02,844
Do I need to worry
about you, Hansen?

602
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:05,047
You falling apart on us, Sarge?

603
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:08,018
Maybe Irons here can sign you up
with the Unitologists.

604
00:47:08,091 --> 00:47:10,025
They seem pretty at peace
with this bullshit.

605
00:47:10,093 --> 00:47:12,357
I'm okay.
Mind your own fucking business.

606
00:47:12,429 --> 00:47:14,693
[door opens]

607
00:47:22,539 --> 00:47:24,530
Seems quiet enough.

608
00:47:24,608 --> 00:47:27,543
Famous last words.

609
00:47:27,611 --> 00:47:28,942
One way to find out.

610
00:47:29,012 --> 00:47:30,274
Move out.

611
00:47:31,915 --> 00:47:33,075
We're not far.

612
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:19,255
[whispering]
It's okay, it's okay.

613
00:48:19,329 --> 00:48:21,456
Keep an eye on Hansen.

614
00:48:24,368 --> 00:48:27,860
You can handle it together.
Come on, come on.

615
00:48:33,143 --> 00:48:35,771
- [screaming]
- Shut the fuck up, Hansen.

616
00:48:35,846 --> 00:48:38,110
We don't need
any attention right now.

617
00:48:38,181 --> 00:48:39,375
Fuck you, Vincent!

618
00:48:39,449 --> 00:48:40,780
This is your fault!

619
00:48:40,851 --> 00:48:43,115
You've killed us, you fuck!
We're all dead.

620
00:48:43,186 --> 00:48:44,778
Hansen, shut your fucking mouth.

621
00:48:47,691 --> 00:48:49,283
You've clocked out, man.
Pull it together.

622
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:51,259
They want our bodies.

623
00:48:51,328 --> 00:48:52,920
And they're going to get them.

624
00:48:54,097 --> 00:48:56,429
- What the...
- [laughing]

625
00:49:02,172 --> 00:49:03,935
[laughing continues]

626

[creature roars]

627
00:49:08,478 --> 00:49:09,706
Shen!

00:50:30,827 --> 00:50:31,987
Yah!

631
00:50:35,198 --> 00:50:37,189
These guys ain't that tough.

632

Shen!

635
00:51:19,242 --> 00:51:21,210
Sorry, boss.

636
00:51:21,278 --> 00:51:23,075
I wasn't fast enough.

637
00:51:29,453 --> 00:51:31,512
Not your fault.

638
00:51:31,588 --> 00:51:33,886
They turn us on ourselves.

639
00:51:33,957 --> 00:51:35,948
If they don't kill us all,

640
00:51:36,026 --> 00:51:38,017
we will kill ourselves.

641
00:51:41,998 --> 00:51:43,329
Let's go.

642
00:51:48,705 --> 00:51:51,936
The captain's body
is secure in the morgue.

643
00:51:52,008 --> 00:51:53,100
What do we do now?

644
00:51:53,176 --> 00:51:55,974
The captain's dead.

645
00:51:56,046 --> 00:51:59,140
We lost control of the ship.

646
00:51:59,216 --> 00:52:00,615
No escape shuttles.

647
00:52:00,684 --> 00:52:03,949
Communication array's
been incapacitated.

648
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:06,181
There's no way of contacting home.

649
00:52:06,256 --> 00:52:09,191
It's only a matter of time
until those things reach us.

650
00:52:09,259 --> 00:52:11,227
All for a fool's errand.

651
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:19,367
[generator powering down]

653
00:52:23,607 --> 00:52:24,938
Can they get through?

654
00:52:25,008 --> 00:52:27,238
- Probably.

00:52:38,622 --> 00:52:40,590
You guys expecting someone else?

657
00:52:49,332 --> 00:52:51,129
You're a sight for sore eyes.

658
00:52:51,201 --> 00:52:52,395
Is that a compliment?

659
00:52:52,469 --> 00:52:53,731
Now I know things are fucked up.

660
00:52:57,874 --> 00:52:59,102
Where's the captain?

661
00:52:59,176 --> 00:53:01,041
He's dead. Kyne killed him.

662
00:53:01,111 --> 00:53:03,045
It could have been an accident.

663
00:53:03,113 --> 00:53:06,105
Well, it doesn't really matter.

664
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:08,674
[generator powering up]

665
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:11,587
What's the ship's status?

666
00:53:11,655 --> 00:53:13,452
I was hoping you'd tell us.

667
00:53:13,523 --> 00:53:15,184
Communication has been shit
since the crack.

668
00:53:15,258 --> 00:53:16,452
We're not really sure
what's going on.

669
00:53:16,526 --> 00:53:19,893
Most of my team was lost, I haven't
been able to raise any other squads.

670
00:53:19,963 --> 00:53:22,329
These fuckers are mean,
but they're beatable.

671
00:53:25,202 --> 00:53:26,794
Don't you see? It's over.

672
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:28,303
Ain't nothing over.

673
00:53:28,371 --> 00:53:30,839
There are still people out there
fighting to survive.

674
00:53:30,907 --> 00:53:32,568
It's our job to help them survive this,

675
00:53:32,642 --> 00:53:34,337
or die trying.

676
00:53:34,411 --> 00:53:36,276
You're an officer for Christ's sake.

677
00:53:36,346 --> 00:53:38,143
- Do your job.
- [alarm blaring]

678
00:53:54,531 --> 00:53:56,795
Oh, what now?

679
00:53:56,866 --> 00:53:58,333
The guidance computers
are losing power.

680
00:53:58,401 --> 00:53:59,800
Can you fix it?

681
00:53:59,869 --> 00:54:01,632
The computer core mainframes
are on D Level.

682
00:54:01,705 --> 00:54:03,764
Whatever's doing it is down there.

683
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:05,364
Can you get me an image?

684
00:54:05,442 --> 00:54:07,603
Seems like the link is still intact.

685
00:54:19,222 --> 00:54:21,281
- It's Kyne.
- What the hell is he doing?

686
00:54:21,358 --> 00:54:23,622
What happens
if those computers go down?

687
00:54:23,693 --> 00:54:26,184
The engines will stop firing correctly.

688
00:54:26,263 --> 00:54:29,164
The weight of the rock we're hauling,
combined with the planet's gravity,

689
00:54:29,232 --> 00:54:31,666
will cause this ship to fall out of orbit.

690
00:54:31,735 --> 00:54:34,499
We'll basically just crash
back into the planet.

691
00:54:34,571 --> 00:54:36,004
He's trying to scuttle the ship.

692
00:54:36,072 --> 00:54:37,232
We've got to stop him.

693
00:54:37,307 --> 00:54:40,435
That's suicide. You'll never make it.

694
00:54:42,612 --> 00:54:44,136
I told you.

695
00:54:44,214 --> 00:54:46,978
We save these people,

696
00:54:47,050 --> 00:54:48,984

Yeah.

Irons, you know where
this vent leads?

706
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:10,595
This is the main cooling duct
for the personnel barracks.

Okay, we're going to
get these guys out of here.

and lead them away from the hatch.

713
00:56:50,039 --> 00:56:51,631
You two enter through the cooling vent

714
00:56:51,708 --> 00:56:54,074
and get the survivors
moving towards the bridge.

715
00:56:54,144 --> 00:56:56,078
No. I'll get their attention.

716
00:56:56,146 --> 00:56:57,636
You two get those guys out.

717
00:56:57,714 --> 00:56:59,306
No time to be a hero.

718
00:56:59,382 --> 00:57:00,679
I'm not a hero.

719
00:57:01,384 --> 00:57:03,318
Just a man.

721
00:57:57,640 --> 00:57:59,574
We're here to help. Come on.

724
00:58:15,825 --> 00:58:17,622
Come on, we've got to move quickly.

725
00:58:18,928 --> 00:58:21,863
You got a boyfriend?

726
00:58:21,931 --> 00:58:24,422
You want to see him again, right?

727
00:58:24,501 --> 00:58:26,264
Mm-hmm.

728
00:58:26,336 --> 00:58:27,667
Good girl.

729
00:58:42,485 --> 00:58:43,816
Must have faith.

730
00:59:13,483 --> 00:59:14,973
Where's Irons?

731
00:59:22,191 --> 00:59:23,988
Holy creatures,

732
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:26,824
transform me into your humble servant.

733
00:59:26,896 --> 00:59:29,057
Show me the path to enlightenment

734
00:59:29,132 --> 00:59:30,827
as you alter my flesh

735
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:32,868
and free my soul.

736
00:59:51,955 --> 00:59:54,788
So that's how they work.

737
00:59:54,857 --> 00:59:56,347
Let's go.

738
01:00:08,972 --> 01:00:10,701
Shit.

739
01:00:11,407 --> 01:00:12,738
Shh.

740
01:00:12,809 --> 01:00:14,140
They haven't seen us yet.

741
01:00:14,210 --> 01:00:15,677
The entrance to the computer core

742
01:00:15,745 --> 01:00:16,939
should be up ahead.

743
01:00:21,918 --> 01:00:23,715
[alarm beeps

744
01:00:23,786 --> 01:00:25,447
We got a problem here.

745
01:00:26,189 --> 01:00:29,022
Hmm. The lock's been
disabled from the inside.

746
01:00:29,092 --> 01:00:30,252
Kyne.

747
01:00:30,326 --> 01:00:32,055
I can bypass it. I need some time.

748
01:00:34,297 --> 01:00:35,389
We don't have time.

749
01:00:41,204 --> 01:00:42,831
Hey Vincent, you know why
I really took this job?

750
01:00:42,905 --> 01:00:43,997
You can tell me later.

751
01:00:44,073 --> 01:00:46,268
My old man always said
I was chicken shit.

752
01:00:46,342 --> 01:00:47,570
He wanted me to join the service.

753
01:00:47,644 --> 01:00:49,771
But I wasn't big on the idea
of getting my ass shot off

754
01:00:49,846 --> 01:00:51,108
in some war zone back home.

755
01:00:51,180 --> 01:00:52,670
Ramirez, they're getting closer.

756
01:00:52,749 --> 01:00:55,013
Give me the all hope is lost
speech another time.

757
01:00:55,084 --> 01:00:57,814
I've always been afraid
of getting into a fight.

758
01:00:57,887 --> 01:01:00,151
- Can you believe that?
- Ramirez, I swear I'll...

759
01:01:00,223 --> 01:01:01,554
I guess it makes sense

760
01:01:01,624 --> 01:01:03,717
as to why I took
a security job, you know?

761
01:01:03,793 --> 01:01:05,784
Badge and a gun
pretty much makes it easy

762
01:01:05,862 --> 01:01:06,988
not to get into a fight.

763
01:01:07,063 --> 01:01:10,032
Will you shut the fuck up
and open that door?

764
01:01:10,099 --> 01:01:12,363
- [keypad beeping]
- It wasn't until all this shit went down

765
01:01:12,435 --> 01:01:14,198
that I realized it ain't
like my old man says.

766
01:01:14,270 --> 01:01:15,794
I'm not a coward.

767
01:01:15,872 --> 01:01:17,703
I just don't like confrontation.

768
01:01:17,774 --> 01:01:20,038
Yeah, that's great. Let's go.

769
01:01:26,349 --> 01:01:27,577
I'm losing it, Alissa.

770
01:01:27,650 --> 01:01:28,878
They're in my head,

771
01:01:28,951 --> 01:01:30,384
and I want to hurt you.

772
01:01:30,453 --> 01:01:31,545
What the...

773
01:01:33,990 --> 01:01:35,184
What are you doing?

774
01:01:35,258 --> 01:01:37,158
The door won't hold them for long.

775
01:01:37,226 --> 01:01:38,693
I'm giving you a head start.

776
01:01:38,761 --> 01:01:40,092
Knock it off, they'll kill you!

777
01:01:40,163 --> 01:01:42,222
It's been an honor
to serve with you, boss.

778

[Ramirez screaming]

779
01:01:48,738 --> 01:01:51,434
Ramirez.

780
01:01:51,507 --> 01:01:54,499
You stupid bastard.

01:02:05,988 --> 01:02:08,821
Get away from

784
01:02:08,891 --> 01:02:10,358
Alissa?

785
01:02:10,426 --> 01:02:12,087
I'm doing what has to be done.

786
01:02:12,161 --> 01:02:13,822
The Marker must not return to Earth.

787
01:02:13,896 --> 01:02:16,330
So you're going to kill us all instead.

788
01:02:16,399 --> 01:02:20,699
We have been deceived into believing
that there are space gods.

789
01:02:20,770 --> 01:02:21,998
Unitology is a lie.

790
01:02:22,071 --> 01:02:24,699
That is the mechanism of control,

791
01:02:24,774 --> 01:02:26,241

792
01:02:26,309 --> 01:02:28,300
under false pretenses.

793
01:02:28,377 --> 01:02:29,708
Get out of my way!

794
01:02:31,948 --> 01:02:33,575
You don't understand!

795
01:02:34,650 --> 01:02:38,609
This is an infection designed
to take over our entire race.

796
01:02:38,688 --> 01:02:40,121
It will do anything it can

797

to spread anything!

798
01:02:47,663 --> 01:02:48,823
No.

799
01:02:48,898 --> 01:02:51,264
An infection can be stopped.

800
01:02:54,403 --> 01:02:56,132
Defiant to the end.

801
01:02:56,205 --> 01:02:59,663
I wouldn't have expected
anything different from you, Alissa.

802
01:02:59,742 --> 01:03:02,210
A good soldier never admits defeat,

01:05:48,878 --> 01:05:50,505
How?

830
01:06:35,324 --> 01:06:37,986
My name is Alissa Vincent.

831
01:06:38,060 --> 01:06:41,621
I was... am the Security Chief

on board the <i>Ishimura.</i>

833
01:06:43,632 --> 01:06:45,600
I may be the sole survivor.

834
01:06:45,668 --> 01:06:48,262
We encountered an alien life form,

835
01:06:48,337 --> 01:06:50,931
they have taken over
the bodies of the crew.

836
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:53,601
The colony was lost.

837
01:06:53,676 --> 01:06:56,941

838
01:06:57,013 --> 01:07:00,073
The <i>Ishimura</i> is under their control.

839
01:07:00,149 --> 01:07:02,709
It is my belief

840
01:07:02,785 --> 01:07:04,753
that the artifact we discovered
on the surface

841
01:07:04,820 --> 01:07:07,448
is somehow responsible.

842
01:07:07,523 --> 01:07:10,458
It has driven us mad.

843
01:07:10,526 --> 01:07:13,256

the <i>Ishimura</i> and the artifact

846
01:07:18,300 --> 01:07:21,167

847
01:07:21,237 --> 01:07:23,296

848
01:07:23,372 --> 01:07:25,135
that many people fought

849
01:07:25,207 --> 01:07:27,869
