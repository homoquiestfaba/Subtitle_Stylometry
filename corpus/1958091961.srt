00:00:40,107 --> 00:00:44,211
<i>This is a story</i>
<i>of life and death.</i>

2
00:00:44,244 --> 00:00:46,179
<i>Specifically, one life</i>
<i>and one death.</i>

3
00:00:48,716 --> 00:00:52,286
<i>More specifically, mine.</i>

4
00:00:58,526 --> 00:01:01,328
<i>My name is Sid Sandagger,</i>
<i>and I have figured out</i>

5
00:01:01,361 --> 00:01:03,497
<i>the key</i>
<i>to a long and happy life.</i>

6
00:01:03,531 --> 00:01:08,803
<i>It's quite simple.</i>
<i>Don't mess with the system.</i>
<i>Think about it.</i>

7
00:01:08,836 --> 00:01:11,673
<i>Every awful thing</i>
<i>that happens to someone</i>
<i>in their life,</i>

8
00:01:11,706 --> 00:01:14,207
<i>it can be chalked up</i>
<i>to them ripping at the fabric</i>

9
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:17,512
<i>of the social continuum.</i>
<i>So don't.</i>

10
00:01:17,545 --> 00:01:19,279
<i>There's a natural order</i>
<i>to things in life,</i>

11
00:01:19,313 --> 00:01:20,949
<i>and it is not</i>
<i>to be reckoned with.</i>

12
00:01:20,982 --> 00:01:22,550
<i>And nowhere</i>
<i>is that more important</i>

13
00:01:22,584 --> 00:01:25,853
<i>than the one environment</i>
<i>more strict,</i>

14
00:01:25,887 --> 00:01:28,221
<i>more brutal, and more savage</i>

15
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:31,025
<i>than all of the rest--</i>
<i>high school.</i>

16
00:01:31,059 --> 00:01:35,697
<i>Luckily, I've developed</i>
<i>three simple rules</i>
<i>to ensure survival.</i>

17
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:39,601
<i>Rule number one?</i>
<i>Shut up.</i>

18
00:01:39,634 --> 00:01:41,069
<i>Most people</i>
<i>don't get beaten up</i>

19
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:43,103
<i>for what they don't say.</i>

20
00:01:43,136 --> 00:01:47,842
<i>Rule number two,</i>
<i>don't stand out.</i>

21
00:01:47,875 --> 00:01:52,245
<i>This applies to everything,</i>
<i>from what you wear,</i>
<i>to who your friends are,</i>

22
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:54,782
<i>to what extra-curriculars</i>
<i>you're a part of.</i>

23
00:01:54,816 --> 00:01:59,053
<i>I have mastered</i>
<i>the art of the nondescript</i>
<i>extra-curricular.</i>

24
00:01:59,087 --> 00:02:01,556
<i>For example, I'm comptroller</i>

25
00:02:01,589 --> 00:02:03,625
<i>for the Eastland High</i>
<i>student council,</i>

26

Midnight tonight, boys.
You excited, Cunningham?

33
00:02:24,579 --> 00:02:27,447
I hacked into

34
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:31,653
- Sweet.
- Also, I think my parents
are getting divorced.

35
00:02:35,455 --> 00:02:41,129
<i>And finally, the third</i>
<i>and most important rule.</i>

36
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:45,133
<i>Don't fuck with Chuck.</i>

37

42
00:02:57,444 --> 00:03:00,148
- Are you boys okay over here?
- Pussy bitch!

43
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,083
<i>...is because</i>
<i>he is super violent.</i>

44
00:03:02,116 --> 00:03:04,217
- Come on. Let's go,
let's go, let's go.
- <i>Here's the big one.</i>

45
00:03:04,251 --> 00:03:06,120
<i>Chuck got kicked out</i>
<i>of his old school</i>

46

<i>for beating a freshmen</i>
<i>nearly to death.</i>

47

<i>Now I'm not a lawyer,</i>

48
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:13,594
<i>but allow me to present</i>
<i>these three facts.</i>

49
00:03:13,628 --> 00:03:18,432
<i>One, Chuck got off</i>
<i>with a few hours</i>
<i>of community service.</i>

50
00:03:18,465 --> 00:03:20,635
<i>Two, Chuck's dad</i>
<i>is super rich</i>

51
00:03:20,668 --> 00:03:23,805
<i>because he owns</i>
<i>all the Mercedes dealerships</i>
<i>in upstate New York.</i>

52
00:03:23,838 --> 00:03:27,175
<i>And three, the judge</i>
<i>hearing Chuck's case</i>

<i>Mercedes Benz.</i>

00:03:40,922 --> 00:03:41,889

56
00:03:41,923 --> 00:03:43,524

- Oh, he gives my dad anxiety.

59

And your dad's a Republican,
and you're marrying a woman,

60
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:22,864

<i>you don't eat,</i>
<i>you don't sleep,</i>

81

<i>It's pure heaven.</i>

84

Then the semen travels
through the vas deferens,

00:05:33,768 --> 00:05:36,938
out the urethra,
and hopefully into the vagina

89
00:05:43,845 --> 00:05:45,146
Or into an anus.

90
00:05:45,179 --> 00:05:46,614
Any questions?

91
00:05:46,647 --> 00:05:49,482
Oh, my God, dude.
Sex Ed is such bullshit.

92
00:05:49,517 --> 00:05:50,785
Like, I don't understand

93
00:05:50,818 --> 00:05:52,620
why we spend
so much time on condoms.

94
00:05:52,653 --> 00:05:54,622
What is there to know?
You open the shit up,

95
00:05:54,655 --> 00:05:56,023
you stick your junk in it,
and you go to town on somebody.

<i>getting laid</i>

<i>and so far</i>
<i>he's achieved neither.</i>

100
00:06:03,564 --> 00:06:05,333
Do they seriously
think dudes are, like,

101
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:07,434
sticking their balls
in it or something?

102
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:11,205
You'd be surprised.
What do you want
them to teach?

103
00:06:11,239 --> 00:06:12,640
- Like, I don't know.
- Heads up!

104
00:06:12,673 --> 00:06:14,642
Why don't they teach us
how to fuck awesome?

105
00:06:14,675 --> 00:06:17,511
'Cause it's Sex Ed.
It's not sex class.

106
00:06:17,545 --> 00:06:19,680
Yeah, but what's the difference?
And unlike trigonometry,

107
00:06:19,714 --> 00:06:22,350
this would be, like, practical,
applicable knowledge.

108
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:25,019
Just talk to
the school board
about it, man.

109
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:28,189
- Wait, you-- you think so?
- Yeah, why not?

110
00:06:28,222 --> 00:06:30,524
You go to the school board
and you say,

111
00:06:30,558 --> 00:06:32,793
"Ladies and gentlemen,
I would like my teachers

112
00:06:32,827 --> 00:06:34,896
- to teach me
how to fuck awesome."
- I'm serious.

113
00:06:34,929 --> 00:06:36,831
Like, how do you
find the clitoris during
over the pants sex stuff?

114
00:06:36,864 --> 00:06:40,368
Can you not say fucking
"clitoris" in the hallway?

115
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,503
You see, this is exactly
what I'm talking about.

116
00:06:42,536 --> 00:06:45,539
Everyone is so horny that
yelling "clit" in the hall

117
00:06:45,573 --> 00:06:47,440
is like yelling fire
in a theater.

118
00:06:47,474 --> 00:06:49,810
Yeah, and you don't yell fire
in a fucking theater.

119
00:06:49,844 --> 00:06:54,582
Regardless,
the clitoris is at the top
of the labia minora.

120
00:06:54,615 --> 00:06:57,218
That sophomore
with the cleft lip?

121
00:06:57,251 --> 00:06:59,220
No, that's Lydia Mindlin.

122
00:06:59,253 --> 00:07:01,022
Yo, Rafi! What's up, man?

123
00:07:01,055 --> 00:07:02,489
- How you doing?
How was that test?
- Who are you?

124
00:07:02,523 --> 00:07:05,960
All right.
Rafi's the best.

125
00:07:05,993 --> 00:07:08,562
- You really shouldn't do that.
- Why? Rafi's my homie.

126
00:07:08,596 --> 00:07:10,197
Rafi's not your fucking homie.

127
00:07:10,231 --> 00:07:12,667
He just tolerates you
because you let him
cheat off you once.

128
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,235
You're just jealous
'cause I'm popular.

129
00:07:14,268 --> 00:07:16,237
- You're not fucking popular,
- Okay.

130
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:17,772
- And that's a blessing.
- Oh, come on.

131
00:07:17,805 --> 00:07:18,940
Don't start with your whole

132
00:07:18,973 --> 00:07:20,875
"don't mess with the system"
bullshit.

133
00:07:20,908 --> 00:07:23,411
- You're just afraid
to live a little.
- I live.

134
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:26,714
What do you call
an all-nighter
playing World Of--

135
00:07:26,747 --> 00:07:29,517
<i>Whoa-ly shit. Tiff Mann.</i>

136
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:32,720
<i>I don't think I've talked</i>
<i>to Tiff Mann since our</i>
<i>figure skating recital</i>

137
00:07:32,753 --> 00:07:35,089
<i>when I was eight years old.</i>

138
00:07:43,731 --> 00:07:45,566
<i>I've been in love with her</i>
<i>the entire time since,</i>

139
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:48,669
<i>but it's clear</i>
<i>that she didn't exactly</i>

140
00:07:48,703 --> 00:07:50,938
<i>see me as boyfriend material.</i>

141
00:07:50,972 --> 00:07:53,240
I've told you,
no sleepovers at boys' houses.

142
00:07:53,274 --> 00:07:55,743
But, Mom, it's just Sid's.

143
00:07:55,776 --> 00:07:57,211
<i>Come to think of it,</i>
<i>neither did her mom.</i>

144
00:07:57,244 --> 00:08:00,414
Oh, that's fine.

145
00:08:00,448 --> 00:08:02,450
<i>Even more fucked up</i>
<i>than that,</i>

146
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,452
<i>Tiff Mann is dating Chuck.</i>

147
00:08:04,518 --> 00:08:07,621
Yo.

148
00:08:07,655 --> 00:08:08,990
Wanna go to
the parking lot right now?

149
00:08:09,023 --> 00:08:10,825
- How was class?
- Sucks.

150
00:08:10,858 --> 00:08:13,160
Mr. Ramirez can literally
lick my butthole.

151
00:08:13,194 --> 00:08:15,129
<i>Suck a dick, Chuck.</i>

152
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:18,532
All right, class, let's go!

153
00:08:18,566 --> 00:08:21,669
- Two laps around the field!
- Oh, my God.

154
00:08:21,702 --> 00:08:26,307
Dude, do you think
Juliana Ulrich would be down
for a finger in the butt?

155
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,275
Good speed! Keep it up!

156
00:08:28,309 --> 00:08:30,644
I really don't think
girls are as into that
as you think they are.

157
00:08:30,678 --> 00:08:32,413
Are you kidding me?
It's a second G-spot.

158
00:08:32,446 --> 00:08:34,648
And I'm usually pretty good
at telling who would be down.

159
00:08:34,682 --> 00:08:37,284
I'm like the Finger
In The Butt Whisperer.

160
00:08:37,318 --> 00:08:39,653
You know who probably sticks
a bunch of fingers in butts?

161
00:08:39,687 --> 00:08:42,523
- Two more laps!
- Chuck. Chuck is the man.

162
00:08:42,556 --> 00:08:44,225
Did you see his latest video?

163
00:08:44,258 --> 00:08:46,761
He totally wrecked
Su-Ming Lee's car
with a pogo stick.

164
00:08:46,794 --> 00:08:50,297
- Chuck's a fucking monster.
- Jim, Jim! Hey.

165
00:08:50,331 --> 00:08:52,500
You haven't told me
what color tie you're
wearing to homecoming.

166
00:08:52,533 --> 00:08:54,168
That's 'cause
I'm not going with you, Luna.

167
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:56,137
<i>Meet Luna Peralta.</i>

168
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:57,972
<i>Luna and Jim have</i>
<i>known each other since</i>
<i>they were in diapers,</i>

169
00:08:58,005 --> 00:09:00,341
<i>and have hated each other</i>
<i>just as long.</i>

170
00:09:00,374 --> 00:09:01,842
<i>Luna does not hold back.</i>

171
00:09:01,876 --> 00:09:03,811
You think I wanna go with you?

172
00:09:03,844 --> 00:09:05,279
Here's a list
of inanimate objects

173
00:09:05,312 --> 00:09:07,148
I would rather take to
Homecoming than you, okay?

174
00:09:07,181 --> 00:09:09,150
Bleach, a bottle of urine,

175
00:09:09,183 --> 00:09:11,520
and rusty nails literally
stuck in my hands.

176
00:09:11,585 --> 00:09:14,321
- Glad we're on the same page.
- My crazy parents only
want me to go with you

177
00:09:14,355 --> 00:09:16,223
'cause they know I'm not
gonna come back pregnant.

178
00:09:16,257 --> 00:09:18,859
Great. Not happening.
Leave me alone. I have herpes.

179
00:09:18,893 --> 00:09:21,328
You wish you had herpes.
That would have to mean
someone touched

180
00:09:21,362 --> 00:09:23,330
- your skinny
little micro-penis.
- It's not skinny.

181
00:09:23,364 --> 00:09:25,399
If anything, girth is my asset
and length is my weakness.

182
00:09:25,433 --> 00:09:26,535
- Okay.
- So fuck off.

183
00:09:26,567 --> 00:09:28,369
Buddy, nothing is your asset,

184
00:09:28,402 --> 00:09:30,539
and being a fuckwad
is your weakness.

185
00:09:30,571 --> 00:09:32,373
Later, shrimp dick.

186
00:09:32,406 --> 00:09:33,707
- She is so mean.
- I know.

187
00:09:33,741 --> 00:09:35,643
- Sandagger, Vega!
- I love it.

188
00:09:45,753 --> 00:09:50,491
- Oh, come on, babe.
- Hey! Hold it.

189
00:09:50,525 --> 00:09:52,193
- What's up?
- Oh.

190
00:09:52,226 --> 00:09:55,863
- Oh. You look awful.
- I'm just tired.

191
00:09:55,896 --> 00:10:00,034
- We got an email.
A parent-y email.
- Yes.

192
00:10:00,067 --> 00:10:05,507
Uh, "Please ensure
proper Homecoming attire,"
blah blah blah.

193
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:10,144
Were you planning on
wearing a very short skirt
to this dance?

194
00:10:10,177 --> 00:10:12,713
Why is this the first time
we're hearing about
this Homecoming?

195
00:10:12,746 --> 00:10:16,283
- 'Cause I'm not going.
- Why not?

196
00:10:16,317 --> 00:10:18,018
Homecoming is a very big deal.

197
00:10:18,052 --> 00:10:19,920
You get all dressed up,
and you wait for some schnook

198
00:10:19,954 --> 00:10:21,889
to pick you up,
and you dance at arm's length,

199
00:10:21,922 --> 00:10:23,858
and then you have
a fleeting sexual encounter.

200
00:10:23,891 --> 00:10:26,927
- And then you realize
that you're a lesbian.
- Yes.

201
00:10:26,961 --> 00:10:28,597
Have you thought
about that, Sid?

202
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:30,364
You might be a lesbian
and not even know it.

203
00:10:30,397 --> 00:10:32,967
- You do like Brandy Carlile.
- And going to Maine.

204
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,337
- Mm, the signs are all there.
- Come on.

205
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:38,839
Why aren't you going?

206
00:10:40,074 --> 00:10:43,043
That was a pretty
compelling argument.

207
00:10:43,077 --> 00:10:44,145
Come on.

208
00:10:44,178 --> 00:10:46,046
Think about it.

209
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:51,318
You don't want to
graduate high school
without any memories.

210
00:10:51,352 --> 00:10:54,623
<i>Actually, I have no problem</i>
<i>leaving high school</i>
<i>without any memories.</i>

211
00:10:54,655 --> 00:10:56,790
<i>I can't imagine</i>
<i>any experience good enough</i>

212
00:10:56,824 --> 00:10:58,926
<i>to risk the possibility</i>
<i>of a bad one.</i>

213
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:01,962
<i>It's like why I don't have</i>
<i>my driver's license.</i>

214
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:08,302
<i>And what's so bad about this?</i>

215
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:10,304
<i>A 72-hour War Monger marathon</i>

216
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:12,641
<i>is pretty awesome and safe.</i>

217
00:11:15,075 --> 00:11:16,944
Game on, baby.

218
00:11:16,977 --> 00:11:20,615
<i>Okay, well, maybe 72 hours</i>
<i>isn't entirely safe.</i>

219
00:11:20,649 --> 00:11:25,119
<i>According to Google,</i>
<i>there are seven specific</i>
<i>signs of sleep deprivation</i>

220
00:11:25,152 --> 00:11:27,221
<i>that all lead</i>
<i>to complete madness.</i>

221
00:11:27,254 --> 00:11:28,489
Heads up, Tiny Tim.

222
00:11:28,523 --> 00:11:30,592
Ow. Stupid hemorrhoid.

223
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:32,561
Look alive, fuckface.

224
00:11:32,594 --> 00:11:36,830
Oh, God. Dude, slow down.

225
00:11:36,864 --> 00:11:38,567
What happened to
no carbs till college?

226
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:41,835
<i>Symptom number one,</i>
<i>you eat a lot.</i>

227
00:11:41,869 --> 00:11:44,138
- I'm fricking starving.
- Oh, pop quiz.

228
00:11:44,171 --> 00:11:46,508
Okay, so you're
driving home from a party
and you can't drive.

229
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:48,709
What do you take?
Uber or Lyft?

230
00:11:48,742 --> 00:11:51,145
<i>Symptom number two,</i>
<i>you're indecisive.</i>

231
00:11:51,178 --> 00:11:55,684
- I don't know.
- Lyft, 'cause their drivers
are super hot.

232
00:11:55,716 --> 00:11:57,284
Plus, Uber is for fascists.

233
00:11:57,318 --> 00:11:59,353
<i>Symptom number three,</i>
<i>you forget things.</i>

234
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:01,322
- What are we talking about?
- I'm open, I'm open!

235
00:12:01,355 --> 00:12:03,625
<i>Symptom number four?</i>
<i>Delayed motor skills.</i>

236
00:12:03,658 --> 00:12:05,192
- Come on, come on.
- Go, go, go, go, go!

237
00:12:05,226 --> 00:12:07,928
<i>Symptom number five,</i>
<i>your pain receptors are...</i>

238
00:12:07,962 --> 00:12:09,396
- Heads up!
- <i>...diminished.</i>

239
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:12,800
Sorry!

240
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:17,271
<i>Symptom number six,</i>
<i>your senses get all weird.</i>

241
00:12:17,304 --> 00:12:21,041
<i>And the final symptom</i>
<i>of sleep deprivation</i>

242
00:12:21,075 --> 00:12:24,878
<i>leading to complete madness,</i>
<i>you lose your filter.</i>

243
00:12:24,912 --> 00:12:26,447
Suck a dick, Chuck.

244
00:12:28,683 --> 00:12:31,118
What did you just say?

245
00:12:35,122 --> 00:12:38,459
- Come on.
- What the fuck did you
just say to me?

246
00:12:39,661 --> 00:12:43,565
Um, I said, uh,

247
00:12:43,598 --> 00:12:47,034
I said suck--
suck her lick, Chuck.

248
00:12:47,067 --> 00:12:50,137
I want you guys
to enjoy kissing each other,

249
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:52,039
'cause, you know, like,
we're not gonna be
young forever.

250
00:12:52,072 --> 00:12:55,577
Uh, I didn't say
that second part,
but I thought it.

251
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:58,445
Uh, what I said, uh...

252
00:13:00,414 --> 00:13:03,050
I said, "Suck a dick."

253
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:07,021
Suck a dick,
you pogo stick-riding douchebag.

254
00:13:07,054 --> 00:13:09,658
You think everyone's
afraid of you? Why?

255
00:13:09,691 --> 00:13:13,193
Because you look like
one of those punching bags
shaped like a torso?

256
00:13:16,797 --> 00:13:18,600
Jimenez, my good man.

257
00:13:18,633 --> 00:13:20,669
I'm not his man.
I don't even know
who the hell he is.

258
00:13:20,702 --> 00:13:23,337
- We ride.
- <i>You remember three rules</i>

259
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:25,072
<i>to getting through</i>
<i>high school alive?</i>

260
00:13:25,105 --> 00:13:29,511
<i>Shut up, don't stand out,</i>
<i>don't fuck with Chuck?</i>

261
00:13:29,544 --> 00:13:31,912
<i>Well, this is what happens</i>
<i>when you break all three</i>

262
00:13:31,945 --> 00:13:37,084
<i>of those rules</i>
<i>in the exact same moment.</i>

263
00:13:38,385 --> 00:13:40,087
Motherfucker.
Tell me another joke.

264
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,489
Tell me another fucking joke.
Huh? Was it worth it?

265
00:13:42,524 --> 00:13:45,627
- I really fucking hope
it was worth it.
- Break it up!

266
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:48,362
- I'm gonna kill you, kid.
I'm gonna fucking kill you.
- Ow!

267
00:13:48,395 --> 00:13:53,334
- Oh! Oh, oh!
- I am going to end your
goddamn miserable life.

268
00:13:53,367 --> 00:13:58,906
- Come here, kid. Come here.
- The next time I see you,
you are fucking dead.

269
00:13:58,939 --> 00:14:01,576
- Get the fuck off me!
- Are you okay?

270
00:14:01,609 --> 00:14:03,944
...fuck off me. God damn it!

271
00:14:12,052 --> 00:14:14,656
This is fucking fantastic.

272
00:14:14,689 --> 00:14:16,290
I've never seen
something like this.

273
00:14:16,323 --> 00:14:19,293
I mean, terrible--
oh, dude, you're up.

274
00:14:19,326 --> 00:14:21,696
This is a fascinating
porn collection.

275
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:23,464
How long have I been out?

276
00:14:23,497 --> 00:14:26,634
Dude, you've been out for,
like, seven hours. Here.

277
00:14:26,668 --> 00:14:29,903
The nurse said
that you were gonna sleep
for a really long time.

278
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,543
- What about Chuck?
- So Luna texted me.

279
00:14:35,577 --> 00:14:38,145
I don't even know how
she got through to me
because I blocked her number,

280
00:14:38,178 --> 00:14:41,882
but she said that Chuck
is only gonna be suspended
for 2 1/2 weeks.

281
00:14:41,915 --> 00:14:44,485
- That's it?
- Plus anger management
counseling.

282
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:47,421
I have two weeks to live.

283
00:14:47,454 --> 00:14:50,991
2 1/2 weeks actually.
So, what? Today's--

284
00:14:51,024 --> 00:14:55,663
Today's Wednesday,
so he's suspended
until the 25th.

285
00:14:55,697 --> 00:14:58,232
Aw, damn it.
That's the day of
the Homecoming dance.

286
00:14:58,265 --> 00:15:00,602
It's not like you need
another reason not to go.

287
00:15:00,635 --> 00:15:03,872
You all right? Sid?

288
00:15:03,904 --> 00:15:05,272
Dude, what are
you thinking about?

289
00:15:05,305 --> 00:15:07,040
<i>- Death.</i>
- I'm gonna kill you.

290
00:15:07,074 --> 00:15:10,545
<i>I broke my rules,</i>
<i>I fucked with the system,</i>

291
00:15:10,578 --> 00:15:12,112
<i>and this is what I deserve.</i>

292
00:15:12,146 --> 00:15:14,516
<i>Chuck is gonna kill me,</i>
<i>and who's gonna stop him?</i>

293
00:15:14,549 --> 00:15:18,352
<i>Not the police,</i>
<i>not the school,</i>
<i>not the courts.</i>

294
00:15:18,385 --> 00:15:20,454
<i>No one ever has.</i>

295
00:15:20,487 --> 00:15:23,424
Sid, you still awake?

296
00:15:28,563 --> 00:15:33,635
Jim told me you two
called out sick from work.

297
00:15:33,668 --> 00:15:35,302
You feeling okay?

298
00:15:43,477 --> 00:15:44,478
Hmm.

299
00:15:47,247 --> 00:15:50,451
Oh, I get it. Boundaries.

300
00:16:13,273 --> 00:16:16,778
<i>This can't be it.</i>
<i>This can't be how it ends.</i>

301
00:16:16,811 --> 00:16:18,078
<i>I've gotta find out</i>
<i>where Chuck is</i>

302
00:16:18,111 --> 00:16:19,614
<i>and explain what happened.</i>

303
00:16:19,647 --> 00:16:21,048
<i>He'll understand.</i>

304
00:16:21,081 --> 00:16:22,449
Well, obviously this would
work a little bit better

305
00:16:22,483 --> 00:16:25,687
if I had a banana
that wasn't quite so ripe.

306
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,421
But I can't find
the demo banana,

307
00:16:27,454 --> 00:16:28,656
so I just took this
out of my lunch.

308
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:30,257
Dude, did you hear?

309
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:32,594
Chuck's parents sent him
to some anger management class

310
00:16:32,627 --> 00:16:34,495
during his suspension
in, like, Switzerland?

311
00:16:34,529 --> 00:16:35,797
It turns out the Swiss

312
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:38,265
are masters
of not giving a fuck.

313
00:16:38,298 --> 00:16:41,603
It sounds dope, and rich,
and you can ski there.

314
00:16:41,636 --> 00:16:44,806
- Maybe he'll forgive you.
- And inside the condom...

315
00:16:44,839 --> 00:16:47,609
Mm, no, you're probably right.

316
00:16:47,642 --> 00:16:51,044
- He's probably gonna
murder you. Sorry, dawg.
- All right, question.

317
00:16:51,078 --> 00:16:55,415
What is the only 100% effective
method of contraception?

318
00:16:55,449 --> 00:16:58,586
- Butt stuff.
- No, that's not it.

319
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:00,287
- Double condoms.
- No.

320
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,789
- Dry humping.
- Abstinence.

321
00:17:01,823 --> 00:17:04,224
It's written--
it's literally on
the board behind me.

322
00:17:04,258 --> 00:17:07,027
Now, Candace is your
student abstinence leader,

323
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:09,764
so she's agreed
to share her experience

324
00:17:09,797 --> 00:17:12,232
or, well, lack thereof.

325
00:17:12,266 --> 00:17:15,235
So, as you guys know,

326
00:17:15,269 --> 00:17:17,137
I have taken
the abstinence pledge.

327
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:18,973
<i>I'm in Sex Ed,</i>
<i>and I'm gonna die a virgin.</i>

328
00:17:19,007 --> 00:17:20,440
<i>What are they gonna write</i>
<i>on my tombstone?</i>

329
00:17:20,474 --> 00:17:23,011
<i>"Here lies Sid Sandagger.</i>
<i>He shrugged."</i>

330
00:17:23,043 --> 00:17:24,946
<i>What's wrong with me?</i>
<i>Was this really my life?</i>

331
00:17:24,979 --> 00:17:26,514
<i>I can't die like this.</i>

332
00:17:26,548 --> 00:17:28,650
<i>Is this why my moms</i>
<i>want me to make memories?</i>

333
00:17:28,683 --> 00:17:31,519
<i>In case some psycho</i>
<i>with a YouTube channel</i>
<i>pounds me to death</i>

334
00:17:31,553 --> 00:17:33,186
<i>on the dance floor</i>
<i>at Homecoming</i>

335
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:35,857
<i>to a Taylor Swift ballad?</i>
<i>I'm sick of it!</i>

336
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:37,025
<i>And this abstinence queen</i>
<i>going on</i>

337
00:17:37,057 --> 00:17:38,860
<i>and on and on and on</i>

338
00:17:38,893 --> 00:17:40,828
- <i>and on and--</i>
- Fuck that.

339
00:17:40,862 --> 00:17:42,062
Sid?

340
00:17:44,364 --> 00:17:47,401
- I'm sorry.
- Candace, please continue.

341
00:17:47,434 --> 00:17:50,872
I'm sorry that
I've wasted so much time
in this dumb class.

342
00:17:50,905 --> 00:17:53,206
Excuse me. Sid Sandagger!

343
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,809
Candace, I'm sorry for
interrupting you, but come on.

344
00:17:54,842 --> 00:17:57,512
Be honest with yourself.
Aren't you tired of lying?

345
00:17:57,545 --> 00:18:02,684
Have you ever dealt
with unhealthy, unclean urges

346
00:18:02,717 --> 00:18:04,986
or impure thoughts?

347
00:18:05,019 --> 00:18:07,187
At this very moment.

348
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:10,324
Do you know what I think about
on a daily basis?

349
00:18:10,357 --> 00:18:12,060
It would traumatize you.

350
00:18:12,092 --> 00:18:13,427
And then I search it
on the internet,

351
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:14,729
and it exists
and there's porn for it.

352
00:18:14,762 --> 00:18:16,064
That means I'm not alone.

353
00:18:16,096 --> 00:18:18,365
You're probably horny
all the time, too!

354
00:18:18,398 --> 00:18:20,735
- Actually--
- It's okay, Candace!

355
00:18:20,768 --> 00:18:22,971
You can admit to flicking it
every now and again.

356
00:18:23,004 --> 00:18:26,074
- No one's gonna crucify you.
- Dude, I don't know
what you're doing,

357
00:18:26,106 --> 00:18:28,743
- but please keep going.
- I'm horny.

358
00:18:28,776 --> 00:18:30,410
You are horny!

359
00:18:30,444 --> 00:18:33,313
Everyone in this room is horny!

360
00:18:33,347 --> 00:18:35,148
Like, what's the big deal?

361
00:18:35,182 --> 00:18:38,553
It takes a slight breeze,
and I am hard as a rock!

362
00:18:38,586 --> 00:18:39,954
All right, Sandagger,
lock it up.

363
00:18:39,988 --> 00:18:41,388
Come on, Dr. Capanna.

364
00:18:41,421 --> 00:18:43,758
This is Sex Ed,
for crying out loud.

365
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:45,392
How can you just stand there

366
00:18:45,425 --> 00:18:48,161
and let this girl
make us all feel badly

367
00:18:48,195 --> 00:18:50,732
for having completely normal
sexual appetites?

368
00:18:50,765 --> 00:18:53,333
- How do you sleep at night?
- Yeah, I don't.

369
00:18:54,802 --> 00:18:56,403
I have really bad apnea.

370
00:18:56,436 --> 00:18:59,339
- It's not because of this.
- Why?

371
00:18:59,373 --> 00:19:02,577
Why do we all have to pretend

372
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:04,277
that we don't
want to fuck each other

373
00:19:04,311 --> 00:19:05,947
six ways to the weekend?

374
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:07,849
We should embrace it!

375
00:19:07,882 --> 00:19:09,282
For crying out loud,

376
00:19:09,316 --> 00:19:11,385
I can see Dave Guggenheim's
boner from here.

377
00:19:11,418 --> 00:19:14,756
And you know what?
I love your boner, Dave.

378
00:19:14,789 --> 00:19:17,525
- Because Dave's boner
is in all of us.
- Yeah.

379
00:19:17,558 --> 00:19:21,228
- We are all Dave's boner!
- Yeah.

380
00:19:21,261 --> 00:19:24,932
And I'm not gonna sit here
and let you make everyone
in this room feel bad

381
00:19:24,966 --> 00:19:28,870
- for having completely normal
sexual appetites.
- Yeah!

382
00:19:28,903 --> 00:19:33,775
My name is Sidney Sandagger,

383
00:19:33,808 --> 00:19:37,444
and I once put a Sharpie
inside of my own butthole.

384
00:19:42,684 --> 00:19:45,419
- I humped a melon.
- Okay, Guggenheim!

385
00:19:45,452 --> 00:19:48,221
I cut a hole in it,
and I microwaved it,
and then I humped it.

386
00:19:48,255 --> 00:19:50,390
Hell yeah, man.
That is disgusting.

387
00:19:50,424 --> 00:19:53,326
Okay, don't encourage him.
That's a UTI waiting to happen.

388
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,596
I get off to porn
of guys doing it
with other guys.

389
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:58,700
- Sit down!
- I use my electric toothbrush
as a vibrator.

390
00:19:58,733 --> 00:20:00,500
My boyfriend and I
are into macrophilia.

391
00:20:00,535 --> 00:20:02,804
I have a reoccurring sex dream
about Elizabeth Warren.

392
00:20:03,871 --> 00:20:04,939
I have vertical balls!

393
00:20:04,972 --> 00:20:06,674
Oh.

394
00:20:06,708 --> 00:20:09,177
Like,
instead of a left one
and a right one,

395
00:20:09,209 --> 00:20:11,411
I have an upstairs
and a downstairs.

396
00:20:11,445 --> 00:20:13,213
It's like two-thirds
a snowman.

397
00:20:13,246 --> 00:20:15,717
It goes pickle, potato,
potato, cinnamon doughnut.

398
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:18,820
That is so hot.

399
00:20:18,853 --> 00:20:20,487
Okay, all right, all right.

400
00:20:20,521 --> 00:20:23,591
Warner, Sandagger,
Guggenheim, okay.
Oh, God damn it.

401
00:20:23,624 --> 00:20:25,693
- No one's taking home condoms.
- Sid, Sid.

402
00:20:28,096 --> 00:20:30,665
Sid, dude!
Dude, what the hell was that?

403
00:20:30,698 --> 00:20:33,835
- I don't know.
- Dude, that was brilliant!

404
00:20:33,868 --> 00:20:36,369
- Come on! Say something!
- I don't know, man.

405
00:20:36,403 --> 00:20:37,972
Dude, that was
fucking incredible!

406
00:20:38,005 --> 00:20:40,174
Like, fuck every
other revolutionary
that's come before you.

407
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:43,211
- Like, you are the Messiah.
- You are Jesus returning.

408
00:20:43,243 --> 00:20:44,512
Candace should've
fucking recognized that.

409
00:20:44,545 --> 00:20:46,413
Like, you are
the king-fucking-penis.

410
00:20:46,446 --> 00:20:48,850
Your schlong definitely
grew three inches from that.

411
00:20:48,883 --> 00:20:50,852
Whatever it is that
made it click for you,

412
00:20:50,885 --> 00:20:52,954
- that's what we gotta
tell everyone about.
- What?

413
00:20:52,987 --> 00:20:55,388
Oh, my God. Sid, we're gonna
get so much pussy from this.

414
00:20:55,422 --> 00:20:57,725
I was so inspired.
I feel liberated!

415
00:20:57,759 --> 00:21:00,228
Like, this is how...

416
00:21:03,197 --> 00:21:06,067
<i>Who is this?</i>
Hugh Hefner would be
so proud of you,

417
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,535
may his soul rest
in fucking peace.

418
00:21:07,568 --> 00:21:09,402
Like, he would be so happy.

419
00:21:09,436 --> 00:21:12,240
I'm going home
and I'm trying that...

420
00:21:16,577 --> 00:21:19,947
- ...like vagina juice.
<i>- What's next?</i>

421
00:21:19,981 --> 00:21:22,250
- That's fucking brilliant!
- <i>How the hell should I know?</i>

422
00:21:22,282 --> 00:21:23,584
It's so DIY, and, like...

423
00:21:25,787 --> 00:21:28,589
- <i>I've never really</i>
<i>thought about it before.</i>

424
00:21:28,623 --> 00:21:30,258
<i>I mean, I don't think</i>
<i>I want to deliver pizzas</i>

425
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:32,260
<i>with Jim</i>
<i>for the rest of my life,</i>

426
00:21:32,292 --> 00:21:34,562
<i>but I'm a senior</i>
<i>in high school.</i>

427
00:21:34,595 --> 00:21:36,798
<i>I don't even know</i>
<i>what I wanna wear tomorrow.</i>

428
00:21:38,132 --> 00:21:41,368
What if I die, Jim?
What if I die?

429
00:21:41,401 --> 00:21:45,273
What are you talk--
Chuck isn't gonna kill you.

430
00:21:45,305 --> 00:21:49,277
Dude, he beat a kid
nearly to death,

431
00:21:49,309 --> 00:21:50,745
and he's been beating
people ever since.

432
00:21:50,778 --> 00:21:52,980
It's not like he's
getting any worse at it.

433
00:21:53,981 --> 00:21:56,416
Oh, God. Two weeks.

434
00:21:58,152 --> 00:21:59,720
What if this is it?

435
00:22:01,321 --> 00:22:02,723
Oh, that is just so sad.

436
00:22:02,757 --> 00:22:05,293
Look, Chuck isn't
gonna kill you, dawg.

437
00:22:05,325 --> 00:22:08,763
- I'll protect you.
- Yeah, sure, you will.

438
00:22:08,796 --> 00:22:11,132
Unless he offers
to let you be in one
of his fucking videos.

439
00:22:11,165 --> 00:22:13,734
You think he'd ever
let me be in one?

440
00:22:15,002 --> 00:22:16,704
- Fuck you, man.
- I'm kidding.

441
00:22:16,737 --> 00:22:21,275
But, like, let's say
for a second that Chuck
might actually kill you,

442
00:22:21,309 --> 00:22:26,147
which I'll admit
is a possibility because
he does have a record.

443
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:28,481
So in this hypothetical world,

444
00:22:28,516 --> 00:22:30,551
then you got two weeks
left to live.

445
00:22:30,585 --> 00:22:32,787
What do you wanna do?

446
00:22:37,859 --> 00:22:38,860
That.

447
00:22:39,961 --> 00:22:42,129
Skip rocks?

448
00:22:42,163 --> 00:22:46,000
No, live.

449
00:22:46,033 --> 00:22:48,002
I wanna fucking live.

450
00:22:48,035 --> 00:22:50,037
What do you mean?

451
00:22:52,139 --> 00:22:54,441
Sidney, where has
that Sharpie been?

452
00:22:56,409 --> 00:23:00,848
Sid, what are you doing?

453
00:23:00,882 --> 00:23:02,884
"Win at some--"

454
00:23:02,917 --> 00:23:04,518
What does that even mean?

455
00:23:04,552 --> 00:23:08,189
I don't know.
I have no idea.

456
00:23:08,222 --> 00:23:10,825
But I'm not gonna,
like, you know,

457
00:23:10,858 --> 00:23:14,394
get a promotion
or start a company

458
00:23:14,427 --> 00:23:17,665
or have a fling
with some foreign girl
on a train in Europe.

459
00:23:17,698 --> 00:23:20,167
Everything that
you do in life,

460
00:23:20,201 --> 00:23:22,937
everything that makes life good,
I have to do it right now.

461
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:27,975
I don't want just some memories.
I want all the memories.

462
00:23:30,244 --> 00:23:31,612
"Know real love."

463
00:23:34,081 --> 00:23:35,616
Are you gonna die a virgin?

464
00:23:41,822 --> 00:23:46,060
Yeah! That's my boy!
Let's go!

465
00:23:46,093 --> 00:23:48,029
Yes! Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

466
00:23:57,271 --> 00:23:59,472
Dude, that sounds insane.

467
00:24:01,509 --> 00:24:04,946
So you're gonna do
all of this in two weeks?

468
00:24:06,614 --> 00:24:09,717
Yeah. What have I got to lose?

469
00:24:14,622 --> 00:24:18,426
Hey! You want some dinner?

470
00:24:18,458 --> 00:24:23,331
Stay impenetrably silent
if you love your mothers.

471
00:24:23,364 --> 00:24:24,966
Yes!

472
00:24:53,794 --> 00:24:55,997
- What's up, dude?
- Hey.

473
00:24:57,164 --> 00:24:59,533
Hey, Sid.

474
00:25:03,337 --> 00:25:06,474
Dude! Sid, dude,
everyone is talking about

475
00:25:06,507 --> 00:25:08,509
your "I'm Boner Spartacus" bit
in Sex Ed yesterday.

476
00:25:08,542 --> 00:25:10,244
- Like, in a good way?
- Yes, like, in a fucking ama--

477
00:25:10,277 --> 00:25:12,947
- Jim! Jim.
- Oh, my God.

478
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:14,648
Luna, what the fuck
do you want?

479
00:25:14,682 --> 00:25:16,751
I don't remember saying
Beetlejuice three times.

480
00:25:16,784 --> 00:25:18,619
Ha, ha, ha.
You're so funny, Jim.

481
00:25:18,652 --> 00:25:20,388
We need to buy tickets
for Homecoming,

482
00:25:20,421 --> 00:25:22,289
- and you have to pay
for them, so...

483
00:25:22,323 --> 00:25:24,658
Well, make sure you tell that
to the Japanese sex robot

484
00:25:24,692 --> 00:25:26,027
that you get to take you
to the dance,

485
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:27,995
'cause I'm not going
with you, Luna.

486
00:25:28,029 --> 00:25:30,498
Dude, dude, dude, dude.
Incoming heatseekers inbound.

487
00:25:30,531 --> 00:25:31,799
- What?
- Hey.

488
00:25:33,501 --> 00:25:35,302
<i>Holy shit.</i>

489
00:25:35,336 --> 00:25:38,606
<i>Oh, please, God,</i>
<i>let Tiff Mann be</i>
<i>my secret texter.</i>

490
00:25:38,639 --> 00:25:40,509
Uh, hey. Hey.

491
00:25:40,541 --> 00:25:44,245
- I'm Tiff.
- Oh, I know.

492
00:25:44,278 --> 00:25:49,583
Um, listen, I just wanted
to say I'm really sorry
about what Chuck did to you.

493
00:25:49,617 --> 00:25:53,020
Oh, no, that's--

494
00:25:53,054 --> 00:25:54,688
that's, uh-- he's--

495
00:25:54,722 --> 00:25:56,891
- that's okay.
- No, it's not okay.

496
00:25:56,924 --> 00:25:59,160
His parents say that
he has impulsivity issues,

497
00:25:59,193 --> 00:26:02,897
but I think he can
just be a dick sometimes.

498
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:05,534
Yeah, yeah.

499
00:26:05,566 --> 00:26:09,703
Also are you going to
go the game tonight?

500
00:26:09,737 --> 00:26:12,773
He'll be there,
and so will I.

501
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:18,412
<i>Now is probably a good time</i>
<i>to talk about hockey.</i>

502
00:26:18,446 --> 00:26:19,880
Let me see you get it in net.

503
00:26:19,914 --> 00:26:21,916
<i>Hockey is a pretty</i>
<i>big deal in Eastland.</i>

504
00:26:21,949 --> 00:26:23,984
- Let's get it in!
- <i>Score a goal,</i>

505
00:26:24,018 --> 00:26:27,121
<i>and you get to feel</i>
<i>what it's like to be a god.</i>

506
00:26:27,154 --> 00:26:29,723
Brad passes it to Worsham.
And he goes for the shot.

507
00:26:29,757 --> 00:26:35,262
He shoots. He scores!

508
00:26:35,296 --> 00:26:37,731
<i>You know who knows that</i>
<i>feeling better than anyone?</i>

509
00:26:37,765 --> 00:26:41,035
- Whoo!
- <i>Eric Worsham.</i>

510
00:26:41,068 --> 00:26:43,037
Eric, Eric, Eric!

511
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:45,606
<i>Eric is like a king</i>
<i>in Eastland.</i>

512
00:26:45,639 --> 00:26:49,578
Face-off at center ice!

513
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:51,812
Good move, man.
Good move, Eric. Come on!

514
00:26:51,846 --> 00:26:54,915
<i>But heavy is the head</i>
<i>that wears the helmet.</i>

515
00:26:54,949 --> 00:26:57,785
<i>Eric has to be perfect,</i>
<i>because if he's not...</i>

516
00:26:57,818 --> 00:27:00,421
Move your fucking feet!
Come on!

517
00:27:00,454 --> 00:27:04,593
<i>...he gets to enjoy</i>
<i>a lifetime of pain</i>
<i>and humiliation.</i>

518
00:27:04,625 --> 00:27:07,562
And they're alone!

519
00:27:07,596 --> 00:27:12,733
And just like that,
the Fighting Spirits have
sent this game into overtime.

520
00:27:12,766 --> 00:27:15,436
Get the fuck up,
you fucking piece of shit!

521
00:27:15,469 --> 00:27:17,872
Eric, that goal!
That's on you!

522
00:27:17,905 --> 00:27:19,940
And Coach Worsham expressing
his frustrations

523
00:27:19,974 --> 00:27:22,409
as they make their way
to the locker room.

524
00:27:22,443 --> 00:27:25,045
I wouldn't wanna be
at that dinner table tonight.

525
00:27:25,079 --> 00:27:26,615
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>
<i>Did I forget to mention?</i>

526
00:27:26,647 --> 00:27:29,316
<i>That psycho coach?</i>
<i>Also Eric's dad.</i>

527
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:32,419
You know what you are?
I can't even say the word

528
00:27:32,453 --> 00:27:34,989
because the school board
won't let me call you
"pussies" anymore.

529
00:27:35,022 --> 00:27:37,191
You pissed away the last period.

530
00:27:37,224 --> 00:27:39,193
God damn, look at me when
I'm fucking talking to you!

531
00:27:39,226 --> 00:27:41,630
Beat the fuck out of someone
out there, okay?

532
00:27:41,662 --> 00:27:43,797
Like we're back
in fucking 'Nam!

533
00:27:43,831 --> 00:27:45,833
What have I got,
a bunch of pacifists?

534
00:27:45,866 --> 00:27:48,570
Or do I have me some warriors
in this fucking room?

535
00:27:48,603 --> 00:27:51,805
Now, I love you boys.
You know I do.

536
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:54,576
On three. One, two, three!

537
00:27:54,609 --> 00:27:56,810
- Go, Frogs!
- Whoo! Go, Frogs!

538
00:27:56,844 --> 00:27:58,946
- Come on, guys.
- Let's go, come on.

539
00:27:58,979 --> 00:28:02,449
Come on, boys, let's go.
Get out there and fucking win.

540
00:28:02,483 --> 00:28:04,818
Come on!
I love you guys.

541
00:28:04,852 --> 00:28:08,122
Get out there, play hard,
play fast.

542
00:28:08,155 --> 00:28:10,191
Come on, guys.
Let's go, come on.

543
00:28:25,372 --> 00:28:26,807
You don't have go out there.

544
00:28:28,543 --> 00:28:30,645
What the hell
are you talking about, man?

545
00:28:30,679 --> 00:28:32,012
Say you go out there, right?

546
00:28:32,046 --> 00:28:33,747
And you do whatever
the hell it was

547
00:28:33,781 --> 00:28:36,116
your dad was screaming about,
and you win the game,

548
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:37,985
and you win
a lot more games, right?

549
00:28:38,018 --> 00:28:40,754
You get a scholarship,
and now you're playing NCAA.

550
00:28:40,788 --> 00:28:42,489
And you do really well there.

551
00:28:42,524 --> 00:28:44,725
And now you're playing
in the NHL.

552
00:28:44,758 --> 00:28:47,861
And now you have fans
and money and women

553
00:28:47,895 --> 00:28:49,496
and you might even win
the Franklin Cup.

554
00:28:49,531 --> 00:28:51,398
- Stanley.
- The Stanley Cup.

555
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,803
But you'll still be miserable,

556
00:28:55,836 --> 00:28:59,873
because you're not
playing to win.

557
00:28:59,907 --> 00:29:02,276
You're playing not to lose.

558
00:29:04,211 --> 00:29:05,879
- I don't know.
- I know what it's like

559
00:29:05,913 --> 00:29:06,880
to live your life
the way you do

560
00:29:06,914 --> 00:29:08,983
because you're afraid.

561
00:29:09,016 --> 00:29:11,885
I used to hide
in all kinds of places.

562
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:16,190
- You hide in here.
- I gotta get back out there.

563
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,128
No, you don't.

564
00:29:23,163 --> 00:29:25,499
Let's go, Frogs!
Let's go, Frogs!

565
00:29:25,533 --> 00:29:29,036
<i>Turns out jockstraps</i>
<i>are super uncomfortable,</i>

566
00:29:29,069 --> 00:29:31,372
<i>especially when you're using</i>
<i>somebody else's.</i>

567
00:29:31,405 --> 00:29:35,142
And we got Eric Worsham
returning to the ice.

568
00:29:35,175 --> 00:29:37,211
Looks like he took
a few extra minutes of rest,

569
00:29:37,244 --> 00:29:39,380
and he'll need it against
these Fighting Spirits.

570
00:29:40,381 --> 00:29:42,216
And face-off at center ice.

571
00:29:42,249 --> 00:29:44,118
The drop!

572
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:49,691
Eric Worsham going offsides.

573
00:29:49,724 --> 00:29:51,892
Ooh, you don't see that
from Worsham every day.

574
00:29:51,925 --> 00:29:55,229
- Uh, we've got a face-off
deep in the Frog territory.
- I'm good, bro.

575
00:29:55,262 --> 00:29:58,098
There's the drop!
Worsham has got the puck.

576
00:29:58,132 --> 00:30:01,168
Oh! Worsham is pounded by
the Spirits, and he's down.

577
00:30:01,201 --> 00:30:02,671
Get your fucking heads
in the game, kids.

578
00:30:02,704 --> 00:30:03,772
Looks like
that'll leave a mark.

579
00:30:03,804 --> 00:30:05,072
Come on, let's go, boys.

580
00:30:05,105 --> 00:30:07,875
<i>Let's go! God damn it.</i>

581
00:30:07,908 --> 00:30:09,376
<i>What the fuck are you doing?</i>

582
00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:12,079
<i>You cock-sucking</i>
<i>son of a fucking bitch.</i>

583
00:30:14,582 --> 00:30:18,085
<i>And then I remembered</i>
<i>why I was here.</i>

584
00:30:18,118 --> 00:30:20,789
<i>For in the realm of the dead,</i>
<i>where I'm going,</i>

585
00:30:20,854 --> 00:30:22,890
<i>I wanna be able</i>
<i>to talk about this shit.</i>

586
00:30:22,923 --> 00:30:24,693
The Frogs lining up
with the Fighting Spirits

587
00:30:24,726 --> 00:30:27,861
- in striking distance.
- Let's go, E.

588
00:30:27,895 --> 00:30:30,632
All right, boys,
sticks down, face-off.

589
00:30:30,665 --> 00:30:34,335
And the puck is down.

590
00:30:34,368 --> 00:30:38,472
Oh! With a huge collision
on center ice.

591
00:30:38,506 --> 00:30:39,973
Worsham now has the puck.

592
00:30:42,811 --> 00:30:44,445
<i>Fuck fear.</i>

593
00:30:44,478 --> 00:30:46,614
<i>I've been doing a lot</i>
<i>of avoiding in my life.</i>

594
00:30:46,648 --> 00:30:48,616
<i>Time to put it to good use.</i>

595
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:51,619
- Oh, he dodges!
- Come on!

596
00:30:51,653 --> 00:30:53,621
He's getting close
to the goal!

597
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:02,930
With a spin like a ballerina!

598
00:31:03,931 --> 00:31:05,499
He shoots!

599
00:31:05,533 --> 00:31:07,501
<i>No fear, motherfucker!</i>

600
00:31:07,535 --> 00:31:08,703
He scores!

601
00:31:10,104 --> 00:31:13,808
Eric Worsham brings
the Frogs to victory!

602
00:31:13,842 --> 00:31:17,144
Eric, Eric, Eric!

603
00:31:17,177 --> 00:31:21,683
Yeah! Whoo-hoo!

604
00:31:26,987 --> 00:31:30,625
- Sid.
- What the fuck?

605
00:31:30,658 --> 00:31:35,329
Sid? Is that the guy that shoved
the sharpie up his asshole?

606
00:31:35,362 --> 00:31:38,399
Um, correction,
that goal was scored by,

607
00:31:38,432 --> 00:31:40,602
and I can't believe
I'm saying this,

608
00:31:40,635 --> 00:31:45,305
my best friend Sid Sandagger!

609
00:31:51,813 --> 00:31:55,784
He's 160 pounds
of pure sexual energy,

610
00:31:55,817 --> 00:31:57,585
and he's very, very single!

611
00:31:57,619 --> 00:31:59,319
Go, Sid!

612
00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:07,161
Hey. Who the fuck are you?

613
00:32:07,194 --> 00:32:10,364
I'm a friend of your son's,
I guess?

614
00:32:10,397 --> 00:32:12,933
I clean the jockstraps.
I give them--
I'm, like, their penis--

615
00:32:12,966 --> 00:32:14,903
Where the fuck
did you learn that thing?

616
00:32:14,935 --> 00:32:18,071
I, um-- I...

617
00:32:18,105 --> 00:32:22,142
Fantastic Figure Skating
for Fabulous Five-Year-Olds.

618
00:32:23,778 --> 00:32:25,045
Can you be
at practice tomorrow?

619
00:32:26,781 --> 00:32:28,516
Yeah.

620
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:31,051
Yes, sir. Yes, coach.

621
00:33:43,323 --> 00:33:44,692
I don't know
what you did to Eric,

622
00:33:44,726 --> 00:33:48,295
but that was some
serious Jedi voodoo shit.

623
00:33:48,328 --> 00:33:50,665
He was just afraid.
I used to live like that.

624
00:33:50,698 --> 00:33:54,201
- Dude, he quit hockey.
He joined the dance team.
- Good for him.

625
00:33:54,234 --> 00:33:56,704
- Yo, what up, Sid?
- What's up, Sandagger?

626
00:34:00,542 --> 00:34:01,676
Who are you?

627
00:34:03,511 --> 00:34:04,311
Moving on.

628
00:34:04,344 --> 00:34:05,847
With Arlene in the hospital

629
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:08,048
for her
Seasonal Affective Disorder,

630
00:34:08,081 --> 00:34:09,784
I will be assuming
the role of interim

631
00:34:09,817 --> 00:34:11,019
student body president.

632
00:34:11,051 --> 00:34:13,021
However,
according to school bylaws,

633
00:34:13,053 --> 00:34:14,488
we will hold a special election

634
00:34:14,522 --> 00:34:16,323
to determine
a permanent replacement

635
00:34:16,356 --> 00:34:18,425
for the remainder
of the year.

636
00:34:18,458 --> 00:34:20,562
Obviously, I will need
a vice-president to run with.

637
00:34:20,595 --> 00:34:23,998
You'll be working with me,
designing campaign signs,

638
00:34:24,032 --> 00:34:28,335
ironing out our platform,
and of course, debating
alongside me in three days.

639
00:34:28,368 --> 00:34:33,307
Expect long, gruesome hours
and a whole lot of fun.

640
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:35,342
Now, raise your hand

641
00:34:35,375 --> 00:34:36,678
if you'd like
to be considered.

642
00:34:40,347 --> 00:34:42,517
<i>You know, I'm not sure</i>
<i>when it became cool</i>

643
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:46,386
<i>to hate on Megan Waters,</i>
<i>or even why, really.</i>

644
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:48,388
<i>But a few months ago,</i>
<i>some kid started</i>
<i>a FarmersOnly account</i>

645
00:34:48,422 --> 00:34:50,892
<i>and posted pictures of her</i>
<i>with a bunch of dicks</i>

646
00:34:50,925 --> 00:34:52,292
<i>and other stuff</i>
<i>flying around.</i>

647
00:34:52,326 --> 00:34:54,494
<i>People can be such jerks.</i>

648
00:34:54,529 --> 00:34:56,864
<i>And when do they decide</i>
<i>that's the one</i>
<i>we're gonna torture?</i>

649
00:34:56,898 --> 00:35:00,233
<i>That's the one</i>
<i>that we're gonna make</i>
<i>feel like shit?</i>

650
00:35:00,267 --> 00:35:02,169
<i>It isn't right.</i>

651
00:35:05,472 --> 00:35:07,075
Great.

652
00:35:07,107 --> 00:35:08,543
I'll give you guys
some time to think it over

653
00:35:08,576 --> 00:35:10,143
and I'll put a sign-up sheet
on the door.

654
00:35:10,177 --> 00:35:13,213
Meeting adjourned.

655
00:35:13,246 --> 00:35:15,817
<i>Before I die, I said</i>
<i>I'd fuck up the system.</i>

656
00:35:15,850 --> 00:35:18,753
<i>Helping Megan Waters</i>
<i>just might be the way.</i>

657
00:35:18,786 --> 00:35:21,022
- Hey, Megan.
- Hey, Sid.

658
00:35:21,055 --> 00:35:22,890
About the whole
vice-president thing?

659
00:35:22,924 --> 00:35:24,391
I'm sure that
I'll find somebody.

660
00:35:24,424 --> 00:35:27,795
I would--
I would love to run with you.

661
00:35:29,262 --> 00:35:31,899
- Really?
- Yeah. Why not?

662
00:35:31,933 --> 00:35:34,936
Well, I should probably vet you
against the other candidates

663
00:35:34,969 --> 00:35:36,638
before I make
any final decisions.

664
00:35:40,108 --> 00:35:42,644
Right. Welcome to the ticket.

665
00:35:44,444 --> 00:35:46,581
<i>I've never really done drugs.</i>

666
00:35:46,614 --> 00:35:48,650
<i>Oh, except in sixth grade</i>
<i>when I took two Tylenol</i>

667
00:35:48,683 --> 00:35:50,417
<i>and drank</i>
<i>three Diet Dr Peppers</i>

668
00:35:50,450 --> 00:35:52,954
<i>and ended up riding</i>
<i>the mammoth at the museum.</i>

669
00:35:52,987 --> 00:35:54,922
<i>Haven't really</i>
<i>experimented since.</i>

670
00:35:54,956 --> 00:35:58,126
This is the shit you want.
You ever spent
the night with molly?

671
00:35:58,158 --> 00:36:00,795
Uh, spent what?

672
00:36:00,828 --> 00:36:02,030
Oh, yeah. No.

673
00:36:02,063 --> 00:36:04,264
Um, what is molly exactly?

674
00:36:04,297 --> 00:36:06,299
You ever been rolling
down a hill in the ice

675
00:36:06,333 --> 00:36:08,603
but felt really hot
in your soul?

676
00:36:08,636 --> 00:36:13,007
Um, no.

677
00:36:13,041 --> 00:36:15,143
It's, like, spiritual.

678
00:36:15,175 --> 00:36:17,310
The real you comes out.

679
00:36:17,344 --> 00:36:18,579
You're gonna trip balls.

680
00:36:18,613 --> 00:36:20,982
Cool. Sweet.

681
00:36:21,015 --> 00:36:22,449
Um, how much do I owe you?

682
00:36:22,482 --> 00:36:27,155
- How much you want?
- Just a few... bits.

683
00:36:27,187 --> 00:36:29,824
- Bits?
- Pieces? I don't know.

684
00:36:29,857 --> 00:36:32,160
Just a handful.
I don't-- what--

685
00:36:32,192 --> 00:36:33,828
Just enough
to have a good time.

686
00:36:33,861 --> 00:36:36,531
- 80.
- 80. Cool.

687
00:36:36,564 --> 00:36:39,466
<i>Usually, I'd be</i>
<i>saving this money for,</i>
<i>I don't know, my future?</i>

688
00:36:39,499 --> 00:36:41,169
<i>That's the nice thing</i>
<i>about imminent death.</i>

689
00:36:41,201 --> 00:36:43,171
<i>It makes financial planning</i>
<i>a lot easier.</i>

690
00:36:43,203 --> 00:36:46,406
But don't take more
than half a pill at a time.

691
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,608
- Half a pill?
- Yeah.

692
00:36:47,642 --> 00:36:49,443
Got it. Okay.

693
00:36:49,476 --> 00:36:53,815
- Minty fresh.
Just like this shit.
- Thank you.

694
00:36:53,848 --> 00:36:56,017
You think that Candace chick
would be down to hump?

695
00:36:56,050 --> 00:36:59,352
The abstinence cop? No.

696
00:36:59,386 --> 00:37:01,321
No, man,
I don't think she is.

697
00:37:03,057 --> 00:37:04,926
I might be catching
feelings for her.

698
00:37:04,959 --> 00:37:06,426
That's too bad, man.

699
00:37:11,666 --> 00:37:15,302
You know what, Dave?
Why wait?

700
00:37:15,335 --> 00:37:17,872
If not now, then when, right?

701
00:37:17,905 --> 00:37:20,808
- Boner bros.
- Boner bros.

702
00:37:23,144 --> 00:37:24,712
Like, a lot of puss.

703
00:37:24,746 --> 00:37:27,380
Oh, dude,
the Frakas twins are having
a party this weekend.

704
00:37:27,414 --> 00:37:29,717
- We gotta go.
- Sweet. What kind of party?

705
00:37:29,751 --> 00:37:32,419
Aw, dude,
it's a wine-tasting party.

706
00:37:32,452 --> 00:37:36,090
They got Austrian whites,
they got a sommelier coming.

707
00:37:36,124 --> 00:37:39,493
I mean, he's gonna-- I mean--
what do you think kind of party?

708
00:37:39,527 --> 00:37:41,062
Yeah, dude.
Whatever, I'm in.

709
00:37:41,095 --> 00:37:42,530
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

710
00:37:42,563 --> 00:37:45,633
Fuck yes, dude!
That's what I'm talking about.

711
00:37:45,666 --> 00:37:47,168
Dude, I thought I was
gonna have to sell that.

712
00:37:47,201 --> 00:37:49,237
Like, for real,
I had this whole thing prepared

713
00:37:49,269 --> 00:37:52,240
about how if we both hook up,
we would be brothers.

714
00:37:52,272 --> 00:37:53,406
Like, not that
we're not already brothers,

715
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,209
but we would be like
boner brothers.

716
00:37:55,243 --> 00:37:58,846
Oh, dude, I'm so sorry,
but Dave Guggenheim
already called that.

717
00:38:13,861 --> 00:38:16,564
<i>You know, I always suspected</i>
<i>Tiff Mann was an angel,</i>

718
00:38:16,597 --> 00:38:18,566
<i>but am I really</i>
<i>falling in love</i>

719
00:38:18,599 --> 00:38:21,903
<i>with an honest to goodness</i>
<i>celestial being?</i>

720
00:38:21,936 --> 00:38:24,539
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, were you
masturbating again?

721
00:38:24,572 --> 00:38:26,574
- What? No!
- That's okay.

722
00:38:26,607 --> 00:38:28,109
Masturbation promotes health.

723
00:38:28,142 --> 00:38:29,644
That's why grandma's
never had the flu.

724
00:38:29,677 --> 00:38:31,679
- Can I help you guys?
- Well, when you are a parent,

725
00:38:31,712 --> 00:38:35,883
and your son's Sex Ed teacher
Dr. Capanna calls you

726
00:38:35,917 --> 00:38:38,318
and tells you that your son
has flipped out in class...

727
00:38:38,351 --> 00:38:41,421
Dr. Capanna, by the way,
sounds like the biggest moron.

728
00:38:41,454 --> 00:38:45,293
But also, if your son,
say, mysteriously ends up

729
00:38:45,325 --> 00:38:48,428
on the cable access
sports channel pucking a goal,

730
00:38:48,461 --> 00:38:51,464
we have no choice
but to get very invasive

731
00:38:51,498 --> 00:38:53,801
and ask what exactly
is going on?

732
00:38:53,835 --> 00:38:55,736
- I'm fine.
- Do you know what?

733
00:38:55,770 --> 00:38:57,205
- You don't look fine.
- Mm-mm.

734
00:38:57,238 --> 00:39:00,274
I had teeny little
mishap at school.

735
00:39:00,308 --> 00:39:01,509
- With a girl?
- No.

736
00:39:01,542 --> 00:39:03,778
- With Dr. Capanna?
- No.

737
00:39:06,013 --> 00:39:10,383
Okay, well,
if you change your mind,
you know where to find us.

738
00:39:18,025 --> 00:39:19,727
- Friday.
- Hmm?

739
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:22,763
I have another game on Friday.

740
00:39:22,797 --> 00:39:26,834
And I am going to
Homecoming next week.

741
00:39:28,435 --> 00:39:30,905
Do you want us
to ask a girl out for you?

742
00:39:30,938 --> 00:39:32,874
Because we are good at that.

743
00:39:32,907 --> 00:39:35,810
No thank you, no.

744
00:39:47,555 --> 00:39:49,690
<i>Well, all right.</i>

745
00:39:49,724 --> 00:39:51,525
<i>It appears as though</i>
<i>I am not the only one</i>

746
00:39:51,559 --> 00:39:53,060
<i>who is fucking up</i>
<i>the system nowadays.</i>

747
00:39:53,094 --> 00:39:56,797
Whoo!

748
00:39:58,199 --> 00:39:59,667
Hey, take five, guys.
What's up?

749
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:01,302
- What's up, man?
- How you doing?

750
00:40:01,335 --> 00:40:02,469
I'd heard you joined
the dance team.

751
00:40:02,503 --> 00:40:04,305
That's-- that was--
that was awesome.

752
00:40:04,338 --> 00:40:06,741
- Hey, nice goal
the other night.
- Thanks, man.

753
00:40:06,774 --> 00:40:08,209
Hey, I wanted to
tell you something.

754
00:40:08,242 --> 00:40:13,547
Um, just thank you
for talking to me
the other night.

755
00:40:13,581 --> 00:40:15,182
I feel like
I'm finally having fun
in high school.

756
00:40:15,216 --> 00:40:17,184
- I'm happy for you, man.
- I should get back there,

757
00:40:17,218 --> 00:40:20,755
- but have a good game Friday.
- Careful on those backflips.

758
00:40:20,788 --> 00:40:23,423
- Hey, don't let my dad
ride you too hard.
- I won't!

759
00:40:23,456 --> 00:40:28,195
- See you around, Sid.
Let's go again.
- All right! Okay, one...

760
00:40:33,601 --> 00:40:35,236
Good God, understudy,

761
00:40:35,269 --> 00:40:36,737
I cannot wait
to kiss that mouth.

762
00:40:36,771 --> 00:40:40,207
It's, like, the hottest
face hole I've ever seen.

763
00:40:40,241 --> 00:40:41,242
God.

764
00:40:41,275 --> 00:40:42,610
<i>Only a total tool</i>

765
00:40:42,643 --> 00:40:43,644
<i>would call Tiff Mann's</i>

766
00:40:43,678 --> 00:40:45,613
<i>perfect lips a face hole.</i>

767
00:40:45,646 --> 00:40:48,749
<i>Then again, Erwin Mueller</i>
<i>is a total tool.</i>

768
00:40:48,783 --> 00:40:51,686
- This time with lights, please.
- Thank you.

769
00:40:51,719 --> 00:40:57,191
♪ Me, alive ♪

770
00:40:57,224 --> 00:41:01,696
♪ You make me alive ♪

771
00:41:04,497 --> 00:41:09,971
♪ A final kiss
before I burn your body ♪

772
00:41:10,004 --> 00:41:13,874
<i>Also, what the fuck</i>
<i>even is this show?</i>

773
00:41:13,908 --> 00:41:15,910
'Cause we know that
Olivia's gonna go after

774
00:41:15,943 --> 00:41:18,446
those one-issue
plastic straw voters,

775
00:41:18,478 --> 00:41:20,348
who aren't even informed,
and they don't even know

776
00:41:20,381 --> 00:41:21,916
that it's landfills
that are causing

777
00:41:21,949 --> 00:41:24,752
the most pollution
in our entire planet.

778
00:41:24,785 --> 00:41:26,454
But we have to appeal to them.

779
00:41:26,486 --> 00:41:28,622
We have to appeal
to that dumb demographic.

780
00:41:28,656 --> 00:41:30,925
Hey!
You know, that's really rude,

781
00:41:30,958 --> 00:41:32,994
to just rifle through
people's things?

782
00:41:33,027 --> 00:41:35,930
What is it? Is it, like,
a diary or a journal?

783
00:41:35,963 --> 00:41:38,466
Is it a hit list?
Are you an assassin?

784
00:41:38,498 --> 00:41:43,571
It sounds stupid,
but I write poetry sometimes.

785
00:41:43,604 --> 00:41:46,107
- Can I hear one?
- No.

786
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:47,942
- Please?
- No.

787
00:41:57,084 --> 00:41:59,720
Look, it's...

788
00:42:01,188 --> 00:42:02,490
I'm still fixing them.

789
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:12,166
Rainbows contain
all of the colors,

790
00:42:12,199 --> 00:42:15,970
but white light contains all
of the colors of the rainbow.

791
00:42:16,003 --> 00:42:19,707
I am the white light
on a cold night.

792
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:21,375
And if you look just right,

793
00:42:21,409 --> 00:42:26,047
you will see all
of the colors inside of me.

794
00:42:27,548 --> 00:42:30,519
There.
Now we can get back
to recycling.

795
00:42:30,551 --> 00:42:32,987
- That was great.
- You don't have to like it.

796
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:37,191
- I know.
- You know, I've never actually

797
00:42:37,224 --> 00:42:39,260
read one of my poems out loud.

798
00:42:39,293 --> 00:42:44,632
Normally when
I try to talk to people,
they just walk away.

799
00:42:44,665 --> 00:42:49,236
Megan, I'm sorry
that I never stuck up for you
in student council.

800
00:42:49,270 --> 00:42:51,005
- It's fine.
- It's not.

801
00:42:51,038 --> 00:42:53,274
It's not. I'm sorry.

802
00:42:54,842 --> 00:42:58,379
Okay, we really need
a stronger stance on cardboard.

803
00:42:58,412 --> 00:43:02,016
Let's just take a break.

804
00:43:03,217 --> 00:43:05,186
I can't just take a break, Sid.

805
00:43:05,219 --> 00:43:07,188
Every minute that we take off

806
00:43:07,221 --> 00:43:09,390
is another one that
Olivia Binghman doesn't.

807
00:43:09,423 --> 00:43:12,393
That dirty whore
has been trying to steal
the council from me for years,

808
00:43:12,426 --> 00:43:15,963
and we are not
about to let that happen.

809
00:43:15,996 --> 00:43:17,098
Mm-hmm.

810
00:43:18,432 --> 00:43:19,967
- Your breath stinks.
- I'm good.

811
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,270
- I have some in my bag.
- Good, 'cause I'm almost out.

812
00:43:26,373 --> 00:43:30,611
I've been meaning to get
the average joe perspective.

813
00:43:30,644 --> 00:43:33,380
What do you feel?
Paper or plastic?

814
00:43:36,383 --> 00:43:40,221
Yeah, my mom threw a hairdryer
at my dad last night.

815
00:43:40,254 --> 00:43:44,125
- I don't know if he bled,
but it look like it hurt.
- Oh, my God.

816
00:43:44,158 --> 00:43:49,663
- Um...
- I wanna believe in love,
but I don't know anymore.

817
00:43:51,665 --> 00:43:55,903
Yeah, that's one of life's
greatest mysteries.

818
00:43:55,936 --> 00:43:57,905
It's big, right?
Like, life-changing.

819
00:43:57,938 --> 00:44:00,609
Mm-hmm, and it's--
just don't feel like
it's your fault.

820
00:44:00,641 --> 00:44:02,843
- I'm sure it's not your fault.
- It might be.

821
00:44:11,652 --> 00:44:12,786
Sorry. I need a minute.

822
00:44:12,820 --> 00:44:16,157
Yeah, take-- I'm sorry. Yeah.

823
00:44:18,459 --> 00:44:20,661
- I didn't mean
to make that weird.
- No, no.

824
00:44:20,694 --> 00:44:22,163
- I'm good. I'm surviving.
- Yeah, of course.

825
00:44:22,196 --> 00:44:24,431
I just-- I wanna be there
and I don't know with to say

826
00:44:24,465 --> 00:44:29,103
because I don't-- I never--
my parents are still in love.

827
00:44:29,136 --> 00:44:32,373
- So, sorry. I just--
- Yeah, thanks for
rubbing that in.

828
00:44:32,406 --> 00:44:37,144
- Um, I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

829
00:44:38,513 --> 00:44:39,548
Attention, Eastland Frogs.

830
00:44:39,581 --> 00:44:40,948
The student council assembly

831
00:44:40,981 --> 00:44:43,184
will begin in ten minutes
in the auditorium.

832
00:44:43,217 --> 00:44:44,952
Where the fuck
have you been, Sandagger?

833
00:44:44,985 --> 00:44:46,655
Megan, this is the men's room.

834
00:44:46,687 --> 00:44:48,489
I know.
What the hell are you
doing in here, huh?

835
00:44:48,523 --> 00:44:52,159
- I'm just peeing.
- You peed?

836
00:44:52,193 --> 00:44:56,598
Every great politician knows,
"No pee before debate.

837
00:44:56,631 --> 00:44:59,500
It's the pee
that makes you great."

838
00:44:59,534 --> 00:45:01,869
I haven't pissed in four days.

839
00:45:01,902 --> 00:45:03,804
Oh, my God.
That's incredibly unhealthy.

840
00:45:03,837 --> 00:45:06,373
By the way, your mints,
they taste like shit.

841
00:45:10,010 --> 00:45:13,881
- No. Oh, shit.
- What?

842
00:45:13,914 --> 00:45:16,217
Are they not mints?

843
00:45:17,718 --> 00:45:19,987
- Uh, kind of.
- Kind of?

844
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:22,890
Okay, there's no such thing as
kind of when it comes to mints.

845
00:45:22,923 --> 00:45:25,759
They either refresh
your breath or they don't.

846
00:45:25,793 --> 00:45:27,494
They freshen your perspective.

847
00:45:28,896 --> 00:45:30,030
Oh, my God, they're a drug.

848
00:45:30,064 --> 00:45:32,900
I've never taken a drug before!

849
00:45:36,337 --> 00:45:39,039
Get the fuck out of here, Eli!

850
00:45:39,073 --> 00:45:41,976
- Move!
- And vote Megan Waters!

851
00:45:42,009 --> 00:45:45,479
Nobody's gonna vote
Megan Waters now.

852
00:45:45,513 --> 00:45:47,281
Relax. It's okay.

853
00:45:47,314 --> 00:45:49,551
- I think I need to call
my pediatrician.
- It's gonna be fine.

854
00:45:49,584 --> 00:45:52,721
I'm-- you're gonna be fine.
I promise.

855
00:45:52,753 --> 00:45:54,455
You're gonna go out there,

856
00:45:54,488 --> 00:45:55,724
and you're gonna be yourself,

857
00:45:55,789 --> 00:45:56,924
and everyone's gonna love you.

858
00:45:56,957 --> 00:45:59,393
- No one loves me, Sid!
- Jesus.

859
00:45:59,426 --> 00:46:00,995
No one even likes me.

860
00:46:01,028 --> 00:46:04,898
Because people like you and me,
we're not pretty.

861
00:46:04,932 --> 00:46:06,800
No! But we're smart.

862
00:46:06,834 --> 00:46:10,505
And that means that
we're supposed to have
good lives after we leave.

863
00:46:10,538 --> 00:46:15,510
No. Megan,
we're gonna start now.

864
00:46:16,544 --> 00:46:18,112
See?

865
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:22,316
You're gonna be fine,
I promise.

866
00:46:23,585 --> 00:46:24,785
Okay.

867
00:46:26,621 --> 00:46:28,822
So what drug was it
that we took?

868
00:46:46,641 --> 00:46:48,075
- Oh, okay.
- Your turn, your turn.

869
00:46:48,108 --> 00:46:49,943
Hey, everyone. Sid Sandagger.

870
00:46:49,977 --> 00:46:51,879
Uh, it is my strong opinion

871
00:46:51,912 --> 00:46:54,516
that Megan
is the fucking best.

872
00:46:54,549 --> 00:46:56,083
- I'm serious, girl,
you're such--
- Really?

873
00:46:56,116 --> 00:46:58,252
- Yeah, you're the fucking shit.
- Aw, dude.

874
00:46:58,285 --> 00:47:01,021
- I love you so fucking much.
- Such good friends.
We've blossomed.

875
00:47:01,055 --> 00:47:02,423
- Our friendship has blossomed.
- Aww, Sid.

876
00:47:02,456 --> 00:47:05,459
Oh, yeah, of course.
Friends.

877
00:47:05,492 --> 00:47:06,960
Okay, I hear ya.

878
00:47:06,994 --> 00:47:11,265
We have evaluated things
and come to the conclusion

879
00:47:11,298 --> 00:47:13,100
that you have all
been cocks to her.

880
00:47:13,133 --> 00:47:14,968
Yeah, you guys--
you guys have been cocks.

881
00:47:15,002 --> 00:47:16,270
- Yeah. Yeah.
- You've been cocks!

882
00:47:16,303 --> 00:47:18,540
Especially you,
Jonathan Gliggman.

883
00:47:18,573 --> 00:47:20,809
Yeah, but she is wonderful,

884
00:47:20,841 --> 00:47:22,811
wonderful,
if you can't tell already.

885
00:47:22,843 --> 00:47:23,911
- Thank you.
- And I think it's about time

886
00:47:23,944 --> 00:47:25,279
that you got to
know her yourself.

887
00:47:25,312 --> 00:47:28,982
So, um, well, without
much further ado, Megan.

888
00:47:29,016 --> 00:47:31,118
Be yourself.
You got this.

889
00:47:33,053 --> 00:47:34,221
Whoo!

890
00:47:44,365 --> 00:47:46,768
I am a prism.

891
00:47:46,801 --> 00:47:51,004
I refract.

892
00:47:51,038 --> 00:47:54,141
But I glow for me.

893
00:47:56,043 --> 00:47:59,848
And I dance for you.

894
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:04,652
And you and you and you
and everybody!

895
00:48:04,686 --> 00:48:08,021
Not her! You made your signs
with signs with glitter,

896
00:48:08,055 --> 00:48:10,457
and I went to Kinko's, bitch.

Whoo! Yeah, Sid!

953
00:51:38,465 --> 00:51:40,735
My acting coach says
I need to follow
my instincts.

954
00:51:40,768 --> 00:51:46,473
Huh. Wait, you have a--
you have an acting coach?

955
00:51:46,507 --> 00:51:50,110
- On YouTube.
- Well, that's 21st century.

956
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:54,247
Um, do you want to--
would you like to go maybe

957
00:51:54,281 --> 00:51:57,652
to the Frakas twins' party
with me tomorrow?

958
00:52:05,292 --> 00:52:07,595
- Okay.
- Oh, yeah. Okay.

959
00:52:07,629 --> 00:52:09,262
Sick. Cool. Uh, dope.

960
00:52:09,296 --> 00:52:11,566
I'll pick you up at 10.

961
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:13,968
- You'll text me?
- I don't have your number.

962
00:52:14,002 --> 00:52:15,637
<i>Don't have my number.</i>

964
00:52:17,672 --> 00:52:19,941
Hey, bud,
you got something
on your face.

965
00:52:39,459 --> 00:52:41,294
Hey, does this shirt
make me look fat?

966
00:52:41,328 --> 00:52:43,564
Like, kinda like when I do this?

967
00:52:43,598 --> 00:52:45,298
Oh, no. No.
Buttons are totally slimming.

968
00:52:45,332 --> 00:52:47,501
- What time again?
- Um, so, 10.

969
00:52:47,535 --> 00:52:50,638
So then I'll pick you up at 9:30
'cause we gotta get Luna first.

970
00:52:50,672 --> 00:52:53,975
- Dude, you're taking Luna?
- It's just for show. What?

971
00:52:54,008 --> 00:52:56,077
Mom!

972
00:52:56,110 --> 00:52:58,311
No wonder you don't like Luna.
You're too busy falling
in love with Sid!

973
00:52:58,345 --> 00:53:02,449
- Mom! Making me date
that brown fire hydrant--
- She is a lovely girl.

974
00:53:02,482 --> 00:53:04,952
- She's like Satan in the flesh.
- I will smack your ass

975
00:53:04,986 --> 00:53:07,055
- back to next Thursday, okay?
- Okay, okay, okay.

976
00:53:07,088 --> 00:53:09,123
That's the kind of woman
you could slap around
in bed a little.

977
00:53:09,157 --> 00:53:11,559
- Okay, Mom, please stop.
- I punched your father
in the face!

978
00:53:11,592 --> 00:53:15,228
- Eww, eww! Mom!
- And then I got down on him
and just went to town!

979
00:53:15,262 --> 00:53:16,731
- Mom!
- Si, and...

980
00:53:34,247 --> 00:53:36,584
Okay. What the fuck.

981
00:53:38,285 --> 00:53:42,090
Oh, that was too many knocks.
Too many knocks. Okay.

982
00:53:42,123 --> 00:53:44,659
- You're not even
gonna say I look nice?
- You don't look nice.

983
00:53:44,692 --> 00:53:46,728
You look like
an incredibly mean person

984
00:53:46,761 --> 00:53:47,762
because you are one.

985
00:53:47,795 --> 00:53:50,363
You have the mustache
of a child molester

986
00:53:50,397 --> 00:53:52,700
and the haircut
of a molested child.

987
00:53:55,737 --> 00:53:57,437
Relax, relax.

988
00:54:10,051 --> 00:54:12,920
- Hey.
- Hey.

989
00:54:12,954 --> 00:54:16,958
Is that your minivan?

990
00:54:19,127 --> 00:54:23,030
It's Jim's.
Great for families.

991
00:54:28,335 --> 00:54:30,171
Fuck my life.

992
00:54:30,204 --> 00:54:32,140
<i>You ever wonder</i>
<i>what life is like</i>

993
00:54:32,173 --> 00:54:33,841
<i>for the cool kids?</i>

994
00:54:33,875 --> 00:54:36,811
<i>Well, tonight I find out.</i>

995
00:54:40,948 --> 00:54:42,650
You okay?

996
00:54:45,953 --> 00:54:48,256
Yeah. Yeah, I'm okay.

997
00:54:48,288 --> 00:54:50,091
- Wanna get a drink?
- Oh, yeah.

998
00:54:50,124 --> 00:54:51,692
- Totally.
- Let's do it.

999
00:54:58,431 --> 00:55:00,367
Cheers.
Let's just go for it. Okay.

1000
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:03,436
- Nice-- oh, you--
- Oh, my God.

1001
00:55:03,470 --> 00:55:06,473
- Is this one bad?
- Sid, come hit this!

1002
00:55:14,414 --> 00:55:17,885
Chug, chug, chug, chug, chug!

1003
00:55:17,919 --> 00:55:19,821
Chug, chug, chug, chug!

1004
00:55:28,262 --> 00:55:31,299
This is literally
the coolest fucking party

1005
00:55:31,331 --> 00:55:33,100
that I have ever been to
in my entire life.

1006
00:55:33,134 --> 00:55:36,771
Why doesn't anybody want
to go ride a horse with me?

1007
00:55:36,804 --> 00:55:38,773
You wanna do one?
Guys, let's go--

1008
00:55:38,806 --> 00:55:41,976
Dude, give them their moment.
Stop hopping on the...

1009
00:55:42,009 --> 00:55:43,778
<i>For a moment...</i>

1010
00:55:43,811 --> 00:55:46,948
<i>...this party</i>
<i>felt like heaven.</i>

1011
00:55:51,686 --> 00:55:53,221
Oh, like you haven't
thought about it.

1012
00:55:53,254 --> 00:55:57,124
Yo. Why aren't you
responding to my texts?

1013
00:55:57,158 --> 00:55:59,426
'Cause I don't want
to talk to you.

1014
00:55:59,459 --> 00:56:02,897
- Okay, let's go for a walk.
- No.

1015
00:56:02,930 --> 00:56:08,169
We're gonna go for a walk,
'cause we clearly have things--

1016
00:56:08,202 --> 00:56:11,404
What the fuck?

1017
00:56:11,438 --> 00:56:14,075
- Uh, uh, Chuck. Yo, dawg.
- I need you to shut up.

1018
00:56:14,108 --> 00:56:16,811
<i>Who gets out of anger</i>
<i>management a week early?</i>

1019
00:56:16,844 --> 00:56:20,348
- <i>Fuck you, Switzerland.</i>
- Dude, don't.

1020
00:56:20,380 --> 00:56:23,818
- Don't do this.
- David, Candace, I--

1021
00:56:23,851 --> 00:56:28,055
I really appreciate it,
but I'm fine.

1022
00:56:30,725 --> 00:56:34,028
Well, now I see
why you wanted
to get me suspended,

1023
00:56:34,061 --> 00:56:36,530
you little piece of shit.

1024
00:56:36,564 --> 00:56:39,100
Give me one good reason

1025
00:56:39,133 --> 00:56:40,968
why I shouldn't
kill you right now.

1026
00:56:41,002 --> 00:56:44,338
- Uh...
- <i>This is it.</i>

1027
00:56:44,372 --> 00:56:48,776
<i>Barring divine intervention,</i>
<i>I am... dead?</i>

1028
00:56:50,378 --> 00:56:52,113
Oh!

1029
00:56:54,982 --> 00:56:59,186
- Not again. Oh!
- <i>It may not have been</i>
<i>a burning bush,</i>

1030
00:56:59,220 --> 00:57:02,790
<i>but if an exploding car</i>
<i>at the time of your</i>
<i>imminent demise</i>

1031
00:57:02,823 --> 00:57:04,592
<i>isn't evidence</i>
<i>of a higher power,</i>

1032
00:57:04,625 --> 00:57:05,626
<i>then I don't know what is.</i>

1033
00:57:05,660 --> 00:57:07,795
<i>Halle-fucking-lujah!</i>

1034
00:57:07,828 --> 00:57:10,463
Let's get the hell out of here.

1035
00:57:10,497 --> 00:57:12,233
- Yeah.
- I think God just did that.

1036
00:57:12,266 --> 00:57:14,434
That was fucking dope!

1037
00:57:14,467 --> 00:57:17,772
Oh, my God.

1038
00:57:22,576 --> 00:57:24,477
- Oh, I'm shaking.
- It just--

1039
00:57:24,512 --> 00:57:26,881
That happened, right?
You saw that too?

1040
00:57:26,914 --> 00:57:29,784
I feel like we're in
a rap video or something.

1041
00:57:29,817 --> 00:57:32,485
- What happened?
- I don't know.

1042
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:41,595
Oh, shit. I'm sorry.

1043
00:57:41,629 --> 00:57:43,731
That just came out.
I don't even know
what noise that was.

1044
00:57:43,764 --> 00:57:48,102
It sounded like
you put a pig in a blender.

1045
00:57:48,135 --> 00:57:50,905
Um, I'm so confused.

1046
00:57:50,938 --> 00:57:53,441
Have you not been texting me
this whole time?

1047
00:57:53,473 --> 00:57:55,076
No, I told you,
I don't have your number.

1048
00:57:55,109 --> 00:57:58,446
Look, the truth is, Sid,

1049
00:57:58,478 --> 00:58:01,382
I've been trying
really hard to like you.

1050
00:58:01,415 --> 00:58:03,818
I mean, like that.

1051
00:58:03,851 --> 00:58:07,088
That's cool, because
I want to like you, too.

1052
00:58:07,121 --> 00:58:11,625
And I do like you,
so I'm like a success story
you can really look up to.

1053
00:58:15,563 --> 00:58:20,500
You know, I've just--
I've felt so trapped dating
Chuck the past few years.

1054
00:58:20,534 --> 00:58:22,636
He and I, we have this cycle.

1055
00:58:22,670 --> 00:58:25,740
It's, like,
we fight, we break up,
we get back together.

1056
00:58:25,773 --> 00:58:27,775
He gets into some
kind of insane trouble

1057
00:58:27,808 --> 00:58:29,777
and I swear that
I'm gonna never date him again.

1058
00:58:29,810 --> 00:58:35,583
And then I just end up
back with him again.

1059
00:58:37,618 --> 00:58:41,856
I guess I just thought
that maybe if I liked you

1060
00:58:41,889 --> 00:58:45,493
then I wouldn't go back
to him, you know?

1061
00:58:45,526 --> 00:58:47,862
I wouldn't make
the same mistake.

1062
00:58:51,132 --> 00:58:53,501
But...

1063
00:58:53,534 --> 00:58:59,173
But I just-- I don't feel
that way about you, Sid.

1064
00:58:59,206 --> 00:59:00,908
I'm sorry.

1065
00:59:05,312 --> 00:59:06,313
Friends?

1066
00:59:24,231 --> 00:59:25,933
She didn't even
jerk you off?

1067
00:59:29,904 --> 00:59:30,905
Bummer.

1068
01:00:16,016 --> 01:00:18,486
<i>Screw, Chuck.</i>
<i>He can't touch me.</i>

1069
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:19,820
- What's up, Sid?
- Yo.

1070
01:00:19,854 --> 01:00:21,523
<i>When he left,</i>
<i>I was invisible.</i>

1071
01:00:21,556 --> 01:00:24,058
<i>Now I'm invincible.</i>

1072
01:00:24,091 --> 01:00:27,261
<i>I'm like a hero,</i>
<i>and people protect heroes.</i>

1073
01:00:27,294 --> 01:00:31,632
<i>Heroes never die, right?</i>

1074
01:01:08,502 --> 01:01:10,304
Uh, hey.

1075
01:01:10,337 --> 01:01:13,040
Hey, can I talk to you guys?

1076
01:01:15,943 --> 01:01:17,646
I think-- I think that--

1077
01:01:17,678 --> 01:01:19,146
I think that you should log off.

1078
01:01:19,180 --> 01:01:20,615
Get the fuck outta here.

1079
01:01:20,649 --> 01:01:23,117
Okay, I get it. I do.

1080
01:01:23,150 --> 01:01:28,489
I love being in here,
but I think you're--

1081
01:01:28,523 --> 01:01:30,625
I just--
I think you're missing out.

1082
01:01:30,659 --> 01:01:32,259
Trust me. I'm you.

1083
01:01:32,293 --> 01:01:35,564
We're to living our lives
to our full potential.

1084
01:01:35,597 --> 01:01:39,934
Out there,
the quests don't wait for you
like they do in here.

1085
01:01:39,967 --> 01:01:43,137
There's a lot more out there
than orcs and night elves

1086
01:01:43,170 --> 01:01:47,241
and you shouldn't be spending
your whole lives hiding.

1087
01:01:51,312 --> 01:01:54,181
Yeah, all right. Okay.

1088
01:02:07,428 --> 01:02:09,930
Whoa, whoa. Sorry. Hey!

1089
01:02:12,099 --> 01:02:14,001
Hey, hey!

1090
01:02:16,737 --> 01:02:19,240
Hey! Hey!

1091
01:02:22,276 --> 01:02:26,548
- What?
- You're, uh...

1092
01:02:26,581 --> 01:02:29,551
Katie.

1093
01:02:29,584 --> 01:02:31,553
You've been texting me
this whole time.

1094
01:02:31,586 --> 01:02:33,053
- I'm sorry, okay? I got--
- No.

1095
01:02:33,087 --> 01:02:34,388
No, don't say you're sorry.

1096
01:02:34,421 --> 01:02:37,191
Just...

1097
01:02:37,224 --> 01:02:38,859
...hi.

1098
01:02:40,227 --> 01:02:42,930
- Hi.
- How do you even
know who I am?

1099
01:02:42,963 --> 01:02:47,569
I think everyone knows
who you are at this point.

1100
01:02:47,602 --> 01:02:49,403
You've been weird.

1101
01:02:49,436 --> 01:02:51,872
Good weird, though.

1102
01:02:51,905 --> 01:02:56,977
And you--
you wanted to help me?

1103
01:02:59,614 --> 01:03:00,682
Yeah.

1104
01:03:00,715 --> 01:03:02,684
Suck a dick, Chuck.

1105
01:03:02,717 --> 01:03:05,052
Why do we all have
to pretend that we don't want
to fuck each other...

1106
01:03:05,085 --> 01:03:07,689
Hugh Hefner would be
so proud of you right now.

- Really?
- Yeah.

Okay.

1118
01:04:16,691 --> 01:04:18,760
I just like bits and pieces.

1119
01:04:18,793 --> 01:04:24,131
- Of the Bible?
- Yeah, of all religions.

1120
01:04:24,164 --> 01:04:30,137
Plus, churches are
really pretty, and quiet,

1121
01:04:30,170 --> 01:04:33,907
and they make boys like you
super uncomfortable.

Amen.

1124
01:04:56,397 --> 01:04:57,565
Amen.

Yeah.

1130
01:05:38,972 --> 01:05:40,941
Did you set Chuck Brawnte's
car on fire?

1131
01:05:40,974 --> 01:05:44,178
- No.
- I had this awful--

1132
01:05:53,621 --> 01:05:56,390
Cool. I can do better.

1133
01:05:56,423 --> 01:05:58,425

01:07:12,700 --> 01:07:14,702
Hey, dawg.

1153
01:07:14,736 --> 01:07:17,572
You wanna come chill with us?
We're gonna shoot a session.

1154
01:07:17,605 --> 01:07:20,008
You need someone to, like,
hold the camera or something?

1155
01:07:20,040 --> 01:07:22,010
No, bro, we need to get you
in a goddamn video.

1156
01:07:22,042 --> 01:07:25,178
- You're hilarious.
- Uh, all right. Yeah.

1157
01:07:25,212 --> 01:07:26,346
Jim, Jim!
Jim, Jim, Jim!

1158
01:07:26,380 --> 01:07:29,182
- All right.
- Fuck yeah, baby!

1159
01:07:29,216 --> 01:07:32,486
- This fucking kid.
- Your dog smells.

1160
01:07:44,064 --> 01:07:46,734
I hope you do die,
you fucking drug addict.

1161
01:07:52,574 --> 01:07:54,107
Hey, guys.

1162
01:08:00,882 --> 01:08:02,215
I could press charges,
you know?

1163
01:08:02,249 --> 01:08:03,685
For what you did to my face?

1164
01:08:03,718 --> 01:08:05,720
My mom had to put chapstick
on my eyelids.

1165
01:08:05,753 --> 01:08:08,455
Okay, what the fuck is going on?

1166
01:08:08,488 --> 01:08:10,058
I feel like
I'm in a fricking, like,

1167
01:08:10,090 --> 01:08:11,593
spaceship right now, right?

1168
01:08:11,626 --> 01:08:14,428
You are in a spaceship.

1169
01:08:14,461 --> 01:08:15,362
Yeah, I am!

1170
01:08:15,395 --> 01:08:17,130
I'm in a fucking
spaceship, dawg!

1171
01:08:17,164 --> 01:08:19,232
- And your boy, Sid?
- Yeah?

1172
01:08:19,266 --> 01:08:21,069
Dude, I've been hearing
so many stories.

1173
01:08:21,101 --> 01:08:22,904
Actually, I have
mad respect for the guy.

1174
01:08:22,937 --> 01:08:24,404
Dude, he's been going crazy.

1175
01:08:24,438 --> 01:08:27,374
He spiked that theater kid's
makeup with Icy Hot

1176
01:08:27,407 --> 01:08:28,776
just so he could go onstage.

1177
01:08:28,810 --> 01:08:31,278
And he got Megan Waters
crazy high for her debate.

1178
01:08:31,311 --> 01:08:32,780
- Megan fucking waters?
- Yeah, yeah.

1179
01:08:32,814 --> 01:08:34,582
He's just trying
to live it up before I X him?

1180
01:08:34,616 --> 01:08:37,250
And, dude,
he's determined
to get laid, too.

1181
01:08:37,284 --> 01:08:38,720
He tried sticking it
to Tiff Mann.

1182
01:08:38,753 --> 01:08:41,288
- But don't worry.
She said no.
- Yeah?

1183
01:08:41,321 --> 01:08:42,924
Now he's trying
to hit on this gamer chick.

1184
01:08:42,957 --> 01:08:44,391
He even went to church with her

1185
01:08:44,424 --> 01:08:45,994
just so that
he could get in her pants

1186
01:08:46,027 --> 01:08:47,227
all before
you fucking kill him.

1187
01:08:47,260 --> 01:08:49,097
Sid, that is cold, brother.

1188
01:08:49,129 --> 01:08:50,732
You're not gonna, like,
hurt him or anything?

1189
01:08:50,765 --> 01:08:53,166
'Cause, like, I'm--
like, I'm down with him.

1190
01:08:53,200 --> 01:08:55,603
No, for sure.
I'm not gonna hurt him.

1191
01:08:55,637 --> 01:08:57,204
- Um...
- Dope.

1192
01:08:57,237 --> 01:09:00,140
'Cause I'm gonna
fucking end him.

1193
01:09:00,173 --> 01:09:03,276
I'm gonna beat him so badly

1194
01:09:03,310 --> 01:09:06,948
that he's never able to feel
a fucking thing ever again.

1195
01:09:06,981 --> 01:09:09,717
- Say, "Hi, Sid."
- Wait, what?

1196
01:09:17,125 --> 01:09:18,926
- Hey!
- Slow down!

1197
01:09:23,196 --> 01:09:24,799
Fuck off, noob.

1198
01:09:36,144 --> 01:09:38,445
<i>What was everyone</i>
<i>so upset about?</i>

1199
01:09:38,478 --> 01:09:41,314
<i>Yeah, they were</i>
<i>part of a list. So what?</i>

1200
01:09:41,348 --> 01:09:44,886
<i>I still did all the things</i>
<i>they thought were great.</i>

1201
01:09:44,919 --> 01:09:47,855
<i>But after the video,</i>
<i>everything went to shit.</i>

1202
01:09:49,489 --> 01:09:51,291
<i>I was kicked off the ice,</i>

1203
01:09:51,324 --> 01:09:53,561
<i>and the rest of the guys</i>
<i>refused to play with me.</i>

1204
01:09:55,730 --> 01:09:59,000
<i>Megan was put on</i>
<i>disciplinary probation</i>
<i>for doing drugs,</i>

1205
01:09:59,033 --> 01:10:01,201
<i>and then kicked off</i>
<i>student council.</i>

1206
01:10:01,234 --> 01:10:05,640
<i>Candace re-pledged</i>
<i>her eternal abstinence</i>
<i>and dumped Dave.</i>

1207
01:10:05,673 --> 01:10:07,675
Oh, yeah, sure...

1208
01:10:07,709 --> 01:10:10,778
<i>Oh, and guess who decided</i>
<i>to be sick today?</i>

1209
01:10:20,688 --> 01:10:22,657
- Hey, man.
- Dude, seriously? Go away.

1210
01:10:22,690 --> 01:10:24,291
- Sid, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Go, dude.

1211
01:10:24,324 --> 01:10:26,027
- I made a mistake.
- Don't fucking touch me.

1212
01:10:26,060 --> 01:10:28,029
- Leave, man.
- I made a mistake.
Just hear me out.

1213
01:10:28,062 --> 01:10:29,329
Just let me talk
for a little bit.

1214
01:10:29,362 --> 01:10:31,298
Do you have any idea
what the fuck you've done?

1215
01:10:31,331 --> 01:10:36,671
- Sid, I do know what I did.
- You have literally
ruined everything.

1216
01:10:36,704 --> 01:10:41,075
All you ever wanted was for
someone popular to like you,
and they never will.

1217
01:10:41,109 --> 01:10:42,210
Luna, was right, Jim.

1218
01:10:42,242 --> 01:10:45,046
You are an insecure
attention whore

1219
01:10:45,079 --> 01:10:46,379
who would literally sell out

1220
01:10:46,413 --> 01:10:48,649
the only real friend
that you have ever had

1221
01:10:48,683 --> 01:10:51,318
for the chance at someone
with more fucking followers.

1222
01:10:51,351 --> 01:10:54,689
Sid. Sid, I'm sorry, dude.

1223
01:10:54,722 --> 01:10:57,457
Sid, come on! Sid!

1224
01:11:00,828 --> 01:11:04,498
<i>Jim is an idiot.</i>

1225
01:11:04,532 --> 01:11:05,666
Stupid.

1226
01:11:09,570 --> 01:11:15,743
I wasn't just trying
to get with you.

1227
01:11:15,777 --> 01:11:17,410
I promise.

1228
01:11:21,048 --> 01:11:22,650
God.

1229
01:11:31,559 --> 01:11:32,660
I know.

1230
01:11:49,811 --> 01:11:52,445
Aah! God!

1231
01:12:06,227 --> 01:12:08,095
<i>This is why I have rules.</i>

1232
01:12:08,129 --> 01:12:09,297
<i>This is why I said to shut up</i>

1233
01:12:09,329 --> 01:12:10,631
<i>and to stay under the radar</i>

1234
01:12:10,665 --> 01:12:12,600
<i>and to not mess</i>
<i>with the system.</i>

1235
01:12:12,633 --> 01:12:15,136
<i>Because when you speak up,</i>
<i>when you care,</i>

1236
01:12:15,169 --> 01:12:17,138
<i>and when you stop</i>
<i>being afraid,</i>

1237
01:12:17,171 --> 01:12:19,941
<i>people will hurt you.</i>

1238
01:12:19,974 --> 01:12:21,642
<i>They will find</i>
<i>that thing inside of you</i>

1239
01:12:21,676 --> 01:12:24,312
<i>that you try so hard</i>
<i>to guard and protect,</i>

1240
01:12:24,344 --> 01:12:26,113
<i>and they will poke at it</i>
<i>and jab at it</i>

1241
01:12:26,147 --> 01:12:30,450
<i>until you want to just crawl</i>
<i>into a little ball and cry,</i>

1242
01:12:30,483 --> 01:12:33,386
<i>and then you might</i>
<i>as well be dead.</i>

1243
01:12:49,837 --> 01:12:53,641
Why haven't you been
answering Jim's DMs?

1244
01:12:53,674 --> 01:12:56,210
I don't really feel like
talking to him right now.

1245
01:12:56,244 --> 01:12:58,512
What he did was stupid.

1246
01:12:58,546 --> 01:13:01,582
But what do you expect?
It's Jim.

1247
01:13:01,616 --> 01:13:04,451
He has
the emotional intelligence
of a premature baby

1248
01:13:04,484 --> 01:13:07,889
and the actual intelligence
of one of those baboons
with the red asses.

1249
01:13:07,922 --> 01:13:09,657
Those are just baboons.

1250
01:13:09,690 --> 01:13:11,959
And they use tools,
they're brilliant animals.

1251
01:13:11,993 --> 01:13:13,426
Well, Jim isn't.

1252
01:13:14,394 --> 01:13:16,063
But he's also your best friend.

1253
01:13:19,767 --> 01:13:21,302
You're coming to
Homecoming tonight, right?

1254
01:13:21,335 --> 01:13:25,072
No. I don't have a date.
I don't have a ride.

1255
01:13:25,106 --> 01:13:28,542
I got you a tie
and boutonnière
when Jim got his.

1256
01:13:28,576 --> 01:13:30,845
Fair warning,
he did that dumb thing

1257
01:13:30,878 --> 01:13:33,581
where he got the pimp cane
and the top hat.

1258
01:13:33,614 --> 01:13:34,481
Ugh.

1259
01:13:34,515 --> 01:13:37,551
As far as a date goes,
fuck it.

1260
01:13:37,585 --> 01:13:40,021
Just show up,
or you'll regret it.

1261
01:13:41,255 --> 01:13:42,556
Chuck will kill me.

1262
01:13:42,590 --> 01:13:45,793
- I blew up Chuck's car.
- What?

1263
01:13:45,826 --> 01:13:47,460
Yeah.

1264
01:13:58,506 --> 01:14:00,875
Grain alcohol
is surprisingly flammable.

1265
01:14:00,908 --> 01:14:03,344
Luna, that's insane.
And a felony.

1266
01:14:03,377 --> 01:14:05,680
- Maybe.
- It is.

1267
01:14:05,713 --> 01:14:07,715
- But do you know why I did it?
- Because you're fucking nuts?

1268
01:14:07,748 --> 01:14:11,419
Because for a moment,
you gave everyone hope.

1269
01:14:11,451 --> 01:14:14,255
Look at all those people
whose lives you affected

1270
01:14:14,288 --> 01:14:16,057
just by being
an arrogant little shit

1271
01:14:16,090 --> 01:14:19,393
by refused to play
by the rules and be quiet.

1272
01:14:19,427 --> 01:14:22,863
Now everybody just thinks
I was using them for
some stupid bucket list.

1273
01:14:22,897 --> 01:14:26,133
But stay home
and hide from Chuck?

1274
01:14:28,468 --> 01:14:29,937
You'll be showing them
that they're right.

1275
01:14:33,473 --> 01:14:35,843
Well, I gotta get back
before lunch is over.

1276
01:14:43,718 --> 01:14:45,152
For you.

1277
01:14:46,988 --> 01:14:49,156
Later, fuckwad.

1278
01:15:07,308 --> 01:15:10,578
- I think we have to start over.
- You know how to tie a tie?

1279
01:15:10,611 --> 01:15:13,047
Can you get a YouTube video
just in case?

1280
01:15:13,080 --> 01:15:16,350
Oh, did you know that this
is called an oriental knot?

1281
01:15:16,384 --> 01:15:18,352
- It goes around
the tree trunk.
- Yeah.

1282
01:15:18,386 --> 01:15:21,155
- Did it.
- Photo time.

1283
01:15:26,861 --> 01:15:28,262
Oh, man, this is my song!

1284
01:15:38,839 --> 01:15:40,674
Get up.

1285
01:15:40,708 --> 01:15:44,712
- Get up.
- Nice cane.

1286
01:15:44,745 --> 01:15:48,983
- Thanks.
- Look, man, I'm sorry

1287
01:15:49,016 --> 01:15:50,818
about some of that stuff
that I said.

1288
01:15:50,851 --> 01:15:53,788
Yeah, you said
some pretty rough stuff.

1289
01:15:53,821 --> 01:15:55,689
I do think you care
a little bit too much

1290
01:15:55,723 --> 01:15:58,993
about being popular,
but I get it.

1291
01:15:59,026 --> 01:16:01,395
I know how good it felt
when I finally started
to get some attention,

1292
01:16:01,429 --> 01:16:03,564
so I don't blame you.

1293
01:16:03,597 --> 01:16:05,699
Boner brothers?

1294
01:16:05,733 --> 01:16:09,036
I thought that was you
and Dave Guggenheim's thing.

1295
01:16:09,070 --> 01:16:12,006
Come on, Jimenez.

1296
01:16:12,039 --> 01:16:13,974
You'll always be
my boner brother.

1297
01:16:15,242 --> 01:16:17,078
I'm gonna go spike the punch.

1298
01:16:24,251 --> 01:16:26,555
Give him some time.

1299
01:16:26,587 --> 01:16:28,255
Jim doesn't think very fast.

1300
01:16:31,258 --> 01:16:33,227
You look nice.

1301
01:16:33,260 --> 01:16:35,396
Thanks.

1302
01:16:35,429 --> 01:16:36,931
You look beautiful.

1303
01:16:36,964 --> 01:16:38,099
I know.

1304
01:16:41,902 --> 01:16:45,940
- Um, will you give me a second?
- Yeah.

1305
01:16:45,973 --> 01:16:49,578
Hey. Um, just--

1306
01:16:49,610 --> 01:16:51,745
- Hey, please.
- Sid, I don't wanna have
this conversation.

1307
01:16:51,779 --> 01:16:54,549
This isn't that.
It's not that conversation.

1308
01:16:54,583 --> 01:16:57,586
This isn't me saying
that I made a mistake,

1309
01:16:57,618 --> 01:17:01,055
or that there was
some big misunderstanding,

1310
01:17:01,088 --> 01:17:04,593
or even telling you that
you're the love of my life

1311
01:17:04,625 --> 01:17:06,595
or the only one for me
or anything.

1312
01:17:06,660 --> 01:17:08,462
This isn't even me
trying to win you back.

1313
01:17:08,496 --> 01:17:11,665
- Okay, then what is it?
- It's goodbye.

1314
01:17:13,934 --> 01:17:16,904
I just-- I wanted
to say that I've had

1315
01:17:16,937 --> 01:17:19,574
a lot of bad days
and a few good ones.

1316
01:17:19,608 --> 01:17:24,513
But the ones that
I spent with you, Katie,
were the best ones.

1317
01:17:24,546 --> 01:17:27,915
And I'm so thankful to you
for that.

1318
01:18:03,250 --> 01:18:04,318
You ready?

1319
01:18:08,122 --> 01:18:09,658
I am.

1320
01:18:09,690 --> 01:18:13,528
<i>As I walk through the valley</i>
<i>of the shadow of high school,</i>

1321
01:18:13,562 --> 01:18:16,997
<i>I take with me my memories,</i>
<i>I leave behind my regrets.</i>

1322
01:18:17,031 --> 01:18:20,267
<i>I have loved, lost,</i>
<i>risen, fallen,</i>

1323
01:18:20,301 --> 01:18:22,002
<i>and now I face the beyond.</i>

1324
01:18:22,036 --> 01:18:24,838
<i>May my beatdown inspire those</i>
<i>who still live in fear.</i>

1325
01:18:24,872 --> 01:18:28,909
<i>I am Sid Sandagger,</i>
<i>and I am no longer afraid!</i>

1326
01:18:28,943 --> 01:18:31,680
<i>And I have lived!</i>

1327
01:18:42,557 --> 01:18:44,593
Oh, shit. Oh, fuck.

1328
01:18:44,626 --> 01:18:46,126
- How does this shit
fucking work?

1329
01:18:46,160 --> 01:18:49,730
That's definitely
not how it works.

1330
01:18:49,763 --> 01:18:53,400
Hey, buddy. How you feel?

1331
01:18:54,569 --> 01:18:55,836
I'm alive?

1332
01:18:55,869 --> 01:18:57,004
Yeah, you're alive.

1333
01:18:57,037 --> 01:18:59,708
I mean,
you look like a Picasso,

1334
01:18:59,740 --> 01:19:01,976
but you're alive.

1335
01:19:06,413 --> 01:19:08,382
- Oh, my God.
- What?

1336
01:19:08,415 --> 01:19:10,484
What happened to your face?

1337
01:19:10,518 --> 01:19:13,555
Oh, um, I think Luna
might've tagged me by accident.

1338
01:19:13,588 --> 01:19:14,922
She is so strong.

1339
01:19:14,955 --> 01:19:17,726
I think it's the low
center of gravity

1340
01:19:17,758 --> 01:19:21,128
- and the rage issues.
- So what happened?

1341
01:19:21,161 --> 01:19:23,831
You went unconscious
pretty quickly,
and then shit went down.

1342
01:19:25,799 --> 01:19:28,002
Break it up!

1343
01:19:28,035 --> 01:19:30,572
Dad, listen to me!
I'm a dancer!

1344
01:19:30,605 --> 01:19:31,573
What do you mean
you're a dancer?

1345
01:19:31,606 --> 01:19:32,741
Yeah!
You know what else?

1346
01:19:35,109 --> 01:19:37,278
I wanna dance!

1347
01:19:37,311 --> 01:19:38,546
Somebody dance with me!

1348
01:19:38,580 --> 01:19:40,414
Now I know why pimps
carry canes!

1349
01:19:45,252 --> 01:19:46,920
- Oh, fuck.
- You stupid bitch.

1350
01:19:46,954 --> 01:19:50,692
- No, I thought we were bros!
- Motherfucker!

1351
01:19:50,725 --> 01:19:54,328
I'll kill you, you hear me?
I'll fucking kill you, bitch!

1352
01:19:55,396 --> 01:19:56,698
I hope you choke to death!

1353
01:19:56,731 --> 01:19:58,600
I'll protect you.

1354
01:19:58,633 --> 01:20:00,100
Protect yourself, bitch.

1355
01:20:00,134 --> 01:20:02,936
- Make your melon.
- Yes.

1356
01:20:09,176 --> 01:20:11,646
- You fought Chuck for me?
- Yeah, of course, dude.

1357
01:20:11,680 --> 01:20:14,348
You're my best friend.

1358
01:20:14,381 --> 01:20:18,018
I'm never gonna let
some piece of shit
beat the shit out of you.

1359
01:20:18,052 --> 01:20:22,757
- Can you walk?
- Oh, fuck.

1360
01:20:22,791 --> 01:20:24,793
Dude, I haven't even tri-- oh.

1361
01:20:24,825 --> 01:20:26,628
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, no, I think so.

1362
01:20:26,661 --> 01:20:27,629
Fuck!

1363
01:20:29,631 --> 01:20:32,866
Well, anyway,
there's some people
who might wanna see you.

1364
01:20:32,900 --> 01:20:35,537
Yeah, I'm good.

1365
01:20:38,606 --> 01:20:39,808
Hey.

1366
01:20:42,476 --> 01:20:43,812
Yeah, you're definitely
gonna need stitches.

1367
01:20:43,844 --> 01:20:47,348
- Ow. Oh, fuck.
- Sid! Hey.

1368
01:20:53,187 --> 01:20:55,489
Sid, way to take
that punch, man.

1369
01:20:55,523 --> 01:20:57,257
Oh!

1370
01:21:19,279 --> 01:21:20,682
So we're agreed
on ground rules?

1371
01:21:20,715 --> 01:21:21,949
One night only,

1372
01:21:21,982 --> 01:21:23,016
and then we never
breathe a word of this

1373
01:21:23,050 --> 01:21:24,619
- to anyone ever again.
- Deal.

1374
01:21:24,652 --> 01:21:25,886
Like it never happened.

1375
01:21:25,919 --> 01:21:27,488
- Wanna know something?
- What?

1376
01:21:27,522 --> 01:21:31,593
- I blew up Chuck's car.
- God, you're fucking crazy.

1377
01:21:46,273 --> 01:21:48,075
Hey.

1378
01:21:48,108 --> 01:21:49,109
Hey.

1379
01:21:49,910 --> 01:21:53,515
How was your day?

1380
01:21:53,548 --> 01:21:54,516
Eventful.

1381
01:21:54,549 --> 01:21:57,217
Can we just start over?

1382
01:21:58,586 --> 01:22:00,755
Yeah.

1383
01:22:00,789 --> 01:22:01,989
I'm Sid.

1384
01:22:03,758 --> 01:22:04,958
I know.

1385
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:08,530
Do you wanna dance?

1386
01:22:10,431 --> 01:22:11,398
Yeah.

1387
01:22:16,937 --> 01:22:18,740
- Oh!
- What?

1388
01:22:18,773 --> 01:22:20,040
What, what?
What, what, what?

1389
01:22:20,073 --> 01:22:22,009
- What, what? What?
- You bit me!

1390
01:22:22,042 --> 01:22:24,646
Why is your tongue so long?
Are you trying to get
my throat pregnant?

1391
01:22:24,679 --> 01:22:27,080
Oh, my God. Why did I think
this would be a good idea?

1392
01:22:27,114 --> 01:22:30,951
- You kiss like a succubus.
- I hate you so much.

1393
01:22:33,454 --> 01:22:36,223
What, what?

1394
01:22:36,256 --> 01:22:38,158
Will you stick a finger
in my butt?

1395
01:22:41,930 --> 01:22:45,299
You are so beautiful.

1396
01:22:55,643 --> 01:22:57,478
Shit, I have a boner.

1397
01:22:58,680 --> 01:23:00,615
Me too.

1398
