1
00:00:00,734 --> 00:00:03,171
(contemplative music)

2
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:47,895
(mortars firing)

3
00:03:52,032 --> 00:03:53,133
- Not any more it's not.

4
00:03:53,133 --> 00:03:56,304
(machine guns firing)

5
00:04:25,799 --> 00:04:28,536
(ethereal music)

6
00:05:01,469 --> 00:05:03,904
(calm music)

7
00:05:47,715 --> 00:05:48,649
- Oh sorry.

8
00:05:50,518 --> 00:05:52,586
Do you know who you are?

9
00:05:52,586 --> 00:05:55,222
I ain't gonna guess
 it, okay okay.

10
00:05:55,222 --> 00:05:57,057
You are Kimberly Radford.

11
00:05:57,057 --> 00:05:57,891
- Emily.

12
00:05:57,891 --> 00:05:59,593
- I mean Emily Radford.

13
00:05:59,593 --> 00:06:00,728
I'm a big fan.

14
00:06:03,063 --> 00:06:04,965
Death Row right, right?

15
00:06:06,066 --> 00:06:08,702
Can I have your autograph?

16
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:11,138
Shit man, right here, unreal.

17
00:06:12,673 --> 00:06:15,509
My wife is not gonna believe it.

18
00:06:15,509 --> 00:06:18,111
- Alright let's leave
 Mrs. Radford alone.

19
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,447
Nice seeing you.

20
00:06:20,448 --> 00:06:21,982
- What's this Ms. Radford shit?

21
00:06:21,982 --> 00:06:24,485
Think we've known each other
 a little too long for that.

22
00:06:24,485 --> 00:06:26,253
It's been a while.

23
00:06:26,253 --> 00:06:27,220
- It sure has.

24
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,155
Want some coffee?

25
00:06:28,155 --> 00:06:29,322
Mike will be back in a second.

26
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:30,290
How about you?

27
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:31,492
- Nothing thanks.

28
00:06:31,492 --> 00:06:33,260
- Rex I'd like
 you to meet Andre.

29
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:35,696
Andre Siegel is one
 of my oldest friends.

30
00:06:35,696 --> 00:06:39,132
Rex Anderson, they used
to call him the mad man.

31
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:41,835
- Not so much mad anymore,
 just generally pissed off.

32
00:06:41,835 --> 00:06:44,938
- Rex used to know me when
 I couldn't pay my rent.

33
00:06:44,938 --> 00:06:45,773
- Here you go.

34
00:06:45,773 --> 00:06:46,974
- Thanks.

35
00:06:46,974 --> 00:06:47,875
- Still got the
 horses Ms. Radford?

36
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:49,176
- No I sold them.

37
00:06:49,176 --> 00:06:50,878
I'm just not up around enough.

38
00:06:50,878 --> 00:06:52,379
- That's too bad.

39
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:54,448
- [Emily] Doesn't look much
 like the old days does it Rex?

40
00:06:54,448 --> 00:06:56,617
- [Rex] Junior's running
it like a business now.

41
00:06:56,617 --> 00:06:57,885
It's all good.

42
00:06:57,885 --> 00:06:59,019
- [Michael] Look I
 was running clubs

43
00:06:59,019 --> 00:07:00,320
long before your balls dropped.

44
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,354
- [Louis] Look it's
 what they want.

45
00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:02,289
- Well it's not what I want.

46
00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:03,457
I don't want that stuff in here.

47
00:07:03,457 --> 00:07:04,458
I don't need that shit in here.

48
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:06,694
That's why I got liquor license.

49
00:07:06,694 --> 00:07:08,295
Now look I like you so
 I'm gonna give you a break

50
00:07:08,295 --> 00:07:09,997
and not end your career
right here and now.

51
00:07:09,997 --> 00:07:12,065
But you do it again
 you're done comprende?

52
00:07:12,065 --> 00:07:13,901
- Hey you know you're
 the boss alright.

53
00:07:13,901 --> 00:07:14,735
- See you tonight.

54
00:07:14,735 --> 00:07:15,569
- Alright.

55
00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:16,403
- Emily.

56
00:07:16,403 --> 00:07:17,337
- Hello Michael.

57
00:07:17,337 --> 00:07:19,372
- Oh my God you look fantastic.

58
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:20,908
- Thank you.

59
00:07:20,908 --> 00:07:23,577
- Hey Rex Junior bought a box
 of candy from some ghetto kid.

60
00:07:23,577 --> 00:07:25,613
Can you stow it on your way out?

61
00:07:25,613 --> 00:07:26,446
- Sure.

62
00:07:27,515 --> 00:07:29,349
- Good to see you Michael.

63
00:07:29,349 --> 00:07:30,317
What was that all about?

64
00:07:30,317 --> 00:07:31,485
- All gap and no zeal.

65
00:07:31,485 --> 00:07:32,853
No one respects me anymore.

66
00:07:32,853 --> 00:07:36,089
And Louis is a travesty,
the man's been too long.

67
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:40,761
Have a seat.

68
00:07:40,761 --> 00:07:42,996
(upbeat music)

69
00:07:42,996 --> 00:07:44,097
How you been?

70
00:07:44,097 --> 00:07:45,432
- I'm always good.

71
00:07:45,432 --> 00:07:48,068
Junior still playing
 the neighbor saint?

72
00:07:48,068 --> 00:07:49,469
- Ain't that the truth?

73
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,071
This him?

74
00:07:51,071 --> 00:07:52,906
- [Emily] Michael, Andre Siegel.

75
00:07:52,906 --> 00:07:54,274
We met in the Philippines.

76
00:07:54,274 --> 00:07:56,309
- On that Vietnam nurse thing?

77
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:59,112
- No, Kate Hodgkins,
 the Naturalist.

78
00:07:59,112 --> 00:08:00,781
- Yeah I read about that.

79
00:08:00,781 --> 00:08:02,683
- They hired Andre to
 help me get in shape.

80
00:08:02,683 --> 00:08:04,051
Hodgkins was pretty buff.

81
00:08:05,085 --> 00:08:06,319
- He did a good job.

82
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,955
- He's my trainer for life.

83
00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:10,758
And he's a fantastic
 martial artist.

84
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:14,928
- Emily I've seen martial
 artists put to sleep

85
00:08:14,928 --> 00:08:16,630
by rank amateur street fighters.

86
00:08:17,565 --> 00:08:19,032
- He can fight.

87
00:08:19,032 --> 00:08:21,902
He was in the French Foreign
 Legion for Christ sakes.

88
00:08:21,902 --> 00:08:22,736
- Really?

89
00:08:22,736 --> 00:08:23,571
- [Emily] Yes.

90
00:08:24,972 --> 00:08:28,175
- I didn't know anyone really
 joined the Foreign Legion.

91
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:29,943
You speak good English?

92
00:08:31,378 --> 00:08:32,946
- I speak five languages sir.

93
00:08:34,582 --> 00:08:36,684
- Well I guess it doesn't
 matter much anyway.

94
00:08:37,885 --> 00:08:40,688
Come by tonight at
 8:30, wear black.

95
00:08:41,722 --> 00:08:42,723
Does he have a suit?

96
00:08:43,657 --> 00:08:45,225
- Thank you, you
won't regret it.

97
00:08:48,161 --> 00:08:50,764
- If Rex okay you,
 the rate's 150.

98
00:08:50,764 --> 00:08:53,867
You work nine to five,
 that's p.m. not a.m.

99
00:08:54,935 --> 00:08:56,403
Any questions?

100
00:08:56,403 --> 00:08:57,571
- [Andre] No questions sir.

101
00:08:57,571 --> 00:08:58,739
- Good.

102
00:08:58,739 --> 00:08:59,573
See you tonight.

103
00:09:10,751 --> 00:09:13,987
- Well you've got a job
 now unless you fuck it up.

104
00:09:15,656 --> 00:09:16,690
- I won't.

105
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:17,524
- You better not.

106
00:09:19,793 --> 00:09:22,963
Andre maybe you should
 get your own place.

107
00:09:24,765 --> 00:09:26,533
- I can get my own place.

108
00:09:26,533 --> 00:09:29,036
- I've got another
 picture coming up

109
00:09:29,036 --> 00:09:30,370
and I'm gonna be gone awhile.

110
00:09:31,471 --> 00:09:33,373
- I understand.

111
00:09:33,373 --> 00:09:34,374
- Then were in sync.

112
00:09:35,843 --> 00:09:39,012
(contemplative music)

113
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:50,924
Why'd they name you
 Andre, your parents?

114
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:52,993
- My parents didn't
 name me Andre.

115
00:09:52,993 --> 00:09:53,827
- Then who did?

116
00:09:55,963 --> 00:09:58,265
- When you join the
 Legion you are christened.

117
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:01,001
Helps you forget
 who you were before.

118
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:02,936
- War again.

119
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:05,338
The drama of battle.

120
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,676
You did all that
 under the wrong name?

121
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:13,280
- A long time ago,
 not the wrong name.

122
00:10:14,715 --> 00:10:17,217
(calm music)

123
00:10:21,789 --> 00:10:23,256
- I like the thought of keeping

124
00:10:23,256 --> 00:10:25,092
the clothes and
 recycling the man.

125
00:10:26,026 --> 00:10:28,061
- I'll pay for it.

126
00:10:28,061 --> 00:10:30,430
- No, I enjoy giving it.

127
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:32,866
(calm music)

128
00:10:47,014 --> 00:10:48,982
(muted club music)

129
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:51,118
- Stay on channel
 one, keep it short.

130
00:10:51,118 --> 00:10:53,153
Michael's got one of
 these in his office

131
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:54,855
so don't say anything stupid.

132
00:10:54,855 --> 00:10:56,289
We use three codes here.

133
00:10:56,289 --> 00:10:58,892
Code blue come immediately
 but no emergency.

134
00:10:58,892 --> 00:11:01,795
Code yellow you come
 immediately serious situation.

135
00:11:01,795 --> 00:11:03,997
Code red, shit's hit the fan.

136
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:06,967
No matter what code I use
 you come immediately okay.

137
00:11:06,967 --> 00:11:08,668
Now stick with me tonight
 and I'll show you the ropes

138
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:11,571
unless we have any gun fights,
 knife fights, fist fights.

139
00:11:11,571 --> 00:11:13,073
Check check.

140
00:11:15,042 --> 00:11:17,110
Now you're not a big guy so
 they're gonna fuck with you.

141
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:18,345
Watch your back.

142
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:19,546
We're outnumbered
 here like 60 to one.

143
00:11:19,546 --> 00:11:21,614
So when the shit
does hit the fan

144
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:23,784
there ain't nowhere
 to hide, come on.

145
00:11:26,153 --> 00:11:28,488
To be honest you don't
 look much like a bouncer.

146
00:11:28,488 --> 00:11:30,623
If I was you I'd hide tonight,

147
00:11:30,623 --> 00:11:31,859
find a good reason
 to stay in the dark.

148
00:11:31,859 --> 00:11:33,460
Come on and meet the guys.

149
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:36,029
This is Serb, he's got a
 fucked up sense of humor.

150
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:36,997
- How you doing man?

151
00:11:36,997 --> 00:11:37,931
It's night to meet you.

152
00:11:37,931 --> 00:11:39,332
You look like my grandmother.

153
00:11:39,332 --> 00:11:42,469
- This is Mourad, he's
 an ugly mother fucker.

154
00:11:42,469 --> 00:11:43,503
- Good to meet you.

155
00:11:44,972 --> 00:11:47,674
- [Rex] Billy Two Hats,
he talks too much.

156
00:11:47,674 --> 00:11:48,508
Just tell him to shut up.

157
00:11:48,508 --> 00:11:49,342
- No I don't.

158
00:11:50,243 --> 00:11:52,012
- Guys meet Andre.

159
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,849
Now get to work you
 anti-social retards.

160
00:11:55,849 --> 00:11:58,151
(club dance music)

161
00:11:58,151 --> 00:11:59,719
- [Serb] Well poured partner.

162
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:00,954
- Thanks bro.

163
00:12:00,954 --> 00:12:02,622
You know I hand picked
everyone of these guys.

164
00:12:02,622 --> 00:12:03,891
(muted club music)

165
00:12:03,891 --> 00:12:06,159
Ain't none of them forced on me.

166
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:07,694
- Always an angle.

167
00:12:07,694 --> 00:12:09,696
New lighting program funky
 enough for you big fella?

168
00:12:09,696 --> 00:12:10,530
- Yeah, it's really nice.

169
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:11,364
- You alright?

170
00:12:11,364 --> 00:12:12,565
Alright sir.

171
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:14,701
- Like anybody
 cares, party time.

172
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:18,806
(club dance music)

173
00:12:18,806 --> 00:12:20,774
Keep an eye for
drunks, throw them out.

174
00:12:20,774 --> 00:12:23,676
(club dance music)

175
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:39,927
- [Drunk] You bitch.

176
00:12:39,927 --> 00:12:41,194
- Okay you're out.

177
00:12:41,194 --> 00:12:44,131
(club dance music)

178
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:02,149
(punches landing)

179
00:13:07,821 --> 00:13:09,456
- Cool there stud he
 ain't moving no more.

180
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:12,659
He hit the jewels, he
 got happy too quick.

181
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:14,194
- Look at this mess.

182
00:13:14,194 --> 00:13:15,996
The new guy's an animal.

183
00:13:15,996 --> 00:13:18,866
- Yee doggy you did that?

184
00:13:18,866 --> 00:13:20,700
(body thumps)

185
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:23,603
(club dance music)

186
00:13:25,672 --> 00:13:30,410
- Get him out of
here front door.

187
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:32,846
(muted club music)

188
00:13:32,846 --> 00:13:35,582
- Hey Mike wants to see you.

189
00:13:35,582 --> 00:13:38,518
(muted club music)

190
00:13:41,989 --> 00:13:44,091
- Thanks Rex we'll
 see you tonight pal.

191
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:48,761
(muted club music)

192
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:51,364
Well you handle
 yourself pretty well.

193
00:13:51,364 --> 00:13:53,766
Except you were a little
rough on the customers.

194
00:13:55,035 --> 00:13:57,470
Your job is to subdue
 them and prevent them

195
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:59,272
from doing any more
 damage to anyone

196
00:13:59,272 --> 00:14:02,742
or anything with the
 minimum of force.

197
00:14:03,944 --> 00:14:06,613
And I emphasize the word
minimum you understand?

198
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,382
- Yes sir.

199
00:14:09,382 --> 00:14:11,084
- Well Rex says you're alright

200
00:14:11,084 --> 00:14:13,286
and that's okay by me, for now.

201
00:14:15,022 --> 00:14:16,589
Welcome aboard.

202
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:17,524
- Thank you sir.

203
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:20,460
(engines rumbling)

204
00:14:25,632 --> 00:14:26,466
- You ride a bike?

205
00:14:26,466 --> 00:14:27,400
- [Andre] Yeah.

206
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,301
- Maybe I get you a good deal.

207
00:14:29,436 --> 00:14:30,670
- You know where I work.

208
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:32,205
- Everybody needs
 transportation.

209
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:35,108
(engines rumbling)

210
00:14:45,085 --> 00:14:47,487
(calm music)

211
00:15:04,104 --> 00:15:07,107
(mortars exploding)

212
00:15:10,477 --> 00:15:12,912
(calm music)

213
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:27,460
- Did you get a parking space?

214
00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:30,097
- I don't have a car.

215
00:15:31,298 --> 00:15:34,801
- My name is Janie, I
 live across from you.

216
00:15:34,801 --> 00:15:37,804
- Hi Andre, nice to meet you.

217
00:15:37,804 --> 00:15:42,009
- Beautiful day isn't it?

218
00:15:42,009 --> 00:15:43,843
I'll catch you later.

219
00:15:43,843 --> 00:15:45,412
- Catch you later.

220
00:15:45,412 --> 00:15:48,581
(contemplative music)

221
00:16:34,961 --> 00:16:38,131
(alarm clock beeping)

222
00:17:09,662 --> 00:17:12,065
- The thing I know
 about real tough guys,

223
00:17:12,065 --> 00:17:13,900
they don't look like
 muscle builders.

224
00:17:15,902 --> 00:17:17,870
Most of those mother
 fuckers are homos.

225
00:17:20,107 --> 00:17:21,941
They're pumping
 iron in the morning.

226
00:17:21,941 --> 00:17:24,444
Spend all day in front
 of a mirror like a broad.

227
00:17:25,612 --> 00:17:27,614
The real tough guy
 nobody can see.

228
00:17:28,781 --> 00:17:30,483
He could be skinny
 bastard Branco.

229
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:33,720
You're new around
 here so he wants

230
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,622
to pummel you around a little.

231
00:17:35,622 --> 00:17:38,458
(punches landing)

232
00:17:47,267 --> 00:17:49,202
He's quick mother fucker.

233
00:17:49,202 --> 00:17:51,704
(punches landing)

234
00:17:51,704 --> 00:17:52,739
- Give me about five minutes.

235
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:58,911
(punches landing)
 (dramatic music)

236
00:18:31,578 --> 00:18:33,180
- You alright man, you okay?

237
00:18:35,648 --> 00:18:37,517
- [Andre] Sorry I lost it.

238
00:18:37,517 --> 00:18:39,819
(helicopter blades whirring)

239
00:18:39,819 --> 00:18:41,020
- You like the food bro?

240
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:44,724
- It's good.

241
00:18:44,724 --> 00:18:45,892
- When you work
 night shift you're

242
00:18:45,892 --> 00:18:48,027
always hungry,
 you're always tired.

243
00:18:48,027 --> 00:18:50,096
I remember working
 night shift in Zagreb.

244
00:18:51,264 --> 00:18:53,966
Same thing bro, always
 hungry always tired.

245
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:56,436
- When did you leave Zagreb?

246
00:18:56,436 --> 00:18:58,037
- 1988.

247
00:18:58,037 --> 00:19:00,072
Have you been to my home?

248
00:19:00,072 --> 00:19:02,008
- I spent some time
 in Leningradsky.

249
00:19:02,008 --> 00:19:02,842
- [Serb] When?

250
00:19:02,842 --> 00:19:04,177
- '89, fall of '90.

251
00:19:05,845 --> 00:19:06,913
- You fought there?

252
00:19:06,913 --> 00:19:08,381
- That's what I did.

253
00:19:08,381 --> 00:19:09,216
- Which side?

254
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:11,050
- Both sides.

255
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,755
(laughing)

256
00:19:19,892 --> 00:19:21,127
- Those not written
 in the book of life

257
00:19:21,127 --> 00:19:22,529
were tossed into
 the lake of fire.

258
00:19:22,529 --> 00:19:24,864
So it is said in
 the book of Romans.

259
00:19:24,864 --> 00:19:26,799
You, you can be the one.

260
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:28,368
You can make a difference.

261
00:19:28,368 --> 00:19:31,271
Jesus said the
 Lord hurled Lucifer

262
00:19:31,271 --> 00:19:33,373
down from Heaven like
a holey lightening bolt

263
00:19:33,373 --> 00:19:35,975
and said go ye from this place.

264
00:19:35,975 --> 00:19:37,777
- Hey got bother someone else.

265
00:19:37,777 --> 00:19:40,046
Don't make me fucking kill you.

266
00:19:40,046 --> 00:19:40,880
Fucker.

267
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,116
Fucking believe this shit.

268
00:19:44,116 --> 00:19:44,951
Baby.

269
00:19:44,951 --> 00:19:46,185
- Baby?

270
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:47,220
What's wrong with
 your phone Serb?

271
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:49,021
What can't call me you fuck?

272
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:50,990
You think I'm just gonna
 sit around and wait for you?

273
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:52,792
Well guess what I'm not because

274
00:19:52,792 --> 00:19:55,828
I wait for no one
 especially not you.

275
00:19:55,828 --> 00:19:57,096
Sorry, sorry.

276
00:19:57,096 --> 00:19:59,366
- Come here, I love you.

277
00:19:59,366 --> 00:20:00,600
- Oh come here (grunts)
oh you love me whatever.

278
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,934
- [Serb] Give me a kiss.

279
00:20:01,934 --> 00:20:04,103
- Janie, Serb.
 - You're so beautiful.

280
00:20:05,104 --> 00:20:06,038
- I don't look beautiful.

281
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:08,441
I don't even know who that is.

282
00:20:08,441 --> 00:20:10,410
- His name is Andre,
 we've already met.

283
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:13,179
- Really?

284
00:20:13,179 --> 00:20:15,014
- He lives across from
 me, we're neighbors.

285
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:19,786
You certainly look more awake.

286
00:20:19,786 --> 00:20:20,720
- Night shift.

287
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,855
You want something to drink?

288
00:20:22,855 --> 00:20:25,658
- Sure, iced tea thanks.

289
00:20:25,658 --> 00:20:27,860
- Excuse me can I have
 some iced tea please?

290
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:33,766
* All the people and the
places that we know *

291
00:20:33,766 --> 00:20:35,167
- Did you get moved in okay?

292
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:37,970
- Yeah all finished.

293
00:20:39,005 --> 00:20:40,507
I dint have much to move though.

294
00:20:40,507 --> 00:20:42,609
Left most my stuff back home.

295
00:20:42,609 --> 00:20:44,311
- Where's back home?

296
00:20:44,311 --> 00:20:45,878
- South Dakota.

297
00:20:45,878 --> 00:20:47,514
I came here about a
 month ago and Ellie

298
00:20:47,514 --> 00:20:49,115
put me up 'til I found my place.

299
00:20:50,383 --> 00:20:51,451
- [Andre] You like it?

300
00:20:52,485 --> 00:20:53,953
- I love it.

301
00:20:53,953 --> 00:20:56,856
It sounds cliche but
 I've come here to act and

302
00:20:56,856 --> 00:20:58,291
it's like I arrived you know?

303
00:21:00,226 --> 00:21:01,728
What do you do?

304
00:21:01,728 --> 00:21:02,829
- I'm a bouncer at the club.

305
00:21:03,696 --> 00:21:04,531
- Really?

306
00:21:05,932 --> 00:21:08,801
- Yeah why won't you stop
 by and visit our club?

307
00:21:08,801 --> 00:21:11,003
- I can't I've got
 class in the morning.

308
00:21:11,003 --> 00:21:11,938
We're doing Cyrano.

309
00:21:13,306 --> 00:21:16,709
I'm working on the
 French accent no.

310
00:21:16,709 --> 00:21:21,314
(speaking in foreign language)

311
00:21:21,314 --> 00:21:22,815
What did you say?

312
00:21:22,815 --> 00:21:24,283
What did he say?

313
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:26,553
- He said he's married with
eight kids but they don't mind.

314
00:21:26,553 --> 00:21:28,555
- Did not.

315
00:21:28,555 --> 00:21:33,426
- Oh shut up, don't
 be such an asshole.

316
00:21:33,426 --> 00:21:35,962
- You should come and see us.

317
00:21:35,962 --> 00:21:38,030
- We'll see what happens.

318
00:21:41,768 --> 00:21:44,437
(upbeat music)

319
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:46,799
(knocking on door)

320
00:22:48,468 --> 00:22:49,736
- Hi.

321
00:22:49,736 --> 00:22:50,570
- Hi.

322
00:22:51,738 --> 00:22:52,972
- You should lock your door.

323
00:22:52,972 --> 00:22:54,641
- We never lock our
 doors back home.

324
00:22:54,641 --> 00:22:56,142
I'll be out in a second.

325
00:22:56,142 --> 00:22:57,343
- I just wanted
 to tell you if you

326
00:22:57,343 --> 00:22:58,678
come by the club tonight--

327
00:22:58,678 --> 00:22:59,946
- What?

328
00:22:59,946 --> 00:23:02,849
- If you could ask for
me I can get you comped.

329
00:23:04,717 --> 00:23:06,018
- Alright.

330
00:23:06,018 --> 00:23:08,220
- I should go.

331
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,656
Bye.

332
00:23:09,656 --> 00:23:10,823
- [Janie] Bye.

333
00:23:12,492 --> 00:23:14,894
(calm music)

334
00:23:18,197 --> 00:23:19,632
(club dance music)

335
00:23:19,632 --> 00:23:21,333
- You can't just go in
 there you gotta be invited.

336
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:25,204
It's not all it's
 cracked up to be.

337
00:23:25,204 --> 00:23:27,106
Don't let the letters
 VIP impress you.

338
00:23:28,207 --> 00:23:30,142
Most of those guys over there,

339
00:23:30,142 --> 00:23:31,744
they're just walking
 turds with money.

340
00:23:32,912 --> 00:23:34,280
- What makes him so special.

341
00:23:35,548 --> 00:23:36,382
- Junior Lopez?

342
00:23:37,717 --> 00:23:38,518
He owns the club.

343
00:23:39,952 --> 00:23:41,187
- I thought it was Michael's.

344
00:23:41,187 --> 00:23:42,855
- [Rex] What were
 you born yesterday?

345
00:23:42,855 --> 00:23:43,856
- [Andre] Day before.

346
00:23:44,957 --> 00:23:46,158
- All these guys are connected.

347
00:23:46,158 --> 00:23:47,326
I thought you knew
 that when you started.

348
00:23:47,326 --> 00:23:49,261
- [Andre] So Junior
 owns the club.

349
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:50,730
- Not on paper.

350
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:53,132
Michael runs it,
we keep it safe.

351
00:23:53,132 --> 00:23:53,966
- No questions.

352
00:23:53,966 --> 00:23:55,502
- Nah.

353
00:23:55,502 --> 00:23:57,436
Watch these guys when they
 laugh, they're nervous.

354
00:23:57,436 --> 00:24:01,007
His crew will open a heart
beat just to impress the prick.

355
00:24:01,007 --> 00:24:02,374
And Junior loves it.

356
00:24:02,374 --> 00:24:03,710
- [Andre] He's got a gun.

357
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:05,411
- [Rex] Red, he's
 Junior's muscle.

358
00:24:06,646 --> 00:24:08,915
- Looks like an asshole to me.

359
00:24:08,915 --> 00:24:11,283
- Yeah, well just
remember it's his moola

360
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:13,986
that pays our
 bills, so be humble.

361
00:24:16,122 --> 00:24:19,058
(muted club music)

362
00:24:21,528 --> 00:24:24,463
(club dance music)

363
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:33,873
- Hey.
 - Hey.

364
00:24:33,873 --> 00:24:35,007
Good to see you.

365
00:24:35,007 --> 00:24:36,709
- We just got here.

366
00:24:36,709 --> 00:24:38,210
- Hey is Michael back there?

367
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:40,046
- Yeah second floor VIP.

368
00:24:40,046 --> 00:24:41,413
- Hey I'm glad you made it.

369
00:24:42,515 --> 00:24:44,917
- Okay, I need a drink,
it's hot outside.

370
00:24:44,917 --> 00:24:47,053
- Excuse me can I
 have a water please?

371
00:24:48,521 --> 00:24:49,756
- [Bartender] Here you go.

372
00:24:50,923 --> 00:24:52,424
- Thank you.

373
00:24:52,424 --> 00:24:54,360
- I only get outside when
 we close everything up.

374
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,227
- That must suck.

375
00:24:56,663 --> 00:24:58,665
- It's light when I get
 in, light when I get out.

376
00:24:59,766 --> 00:25:01,433
Just a long long day.

377
00:25:01,433 --> 00:25:03,836
- Amidst throwing the guys out.

378
00:25:03,836 --> 00:25:06,973
- Doesn't bother me
 much, it's a job.

379
00:25:06,973 --> 00:25:09,909
(club dance music)

380
00:25:16,248 --> 00:25:18,050
- What's that over there?

381
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:20,452
- The VIP's and their guests.

382
00:25:21,588 --> 00:25:22,822
- I'm a guest,
 can I go up there?

383
00:25:24,123 --> 00:25:25,592
- Maybe some other time okay.

384
00:25:26,826 --> 00:25:29,095
- I think I'd like
 that drink now.

385
00:25:29,095 --> 00:25:31,864
(dramatic music)

386
00:25:59,425 --> 00:26:00,492
I thought I heard you.

387
00:26:02,361 --> 00:26:03,830
You should lock
 your doors you know.

388
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:06,032
We've got nothing like
 that in South Dakota.

389
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:11,570
We got a couple of bars where
 farmers go to get drunk and

390
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:14,540
pinball machines and a
 jukebox but that's about it.

391
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:16,575
- [Andre] I'm glad
 you had a good time.

392
00:26:18,477 --> 00:26:20,312
- I think I mixed
 my drinks a little.

393
00:26:20,312 --> 00:26:21,180
- It happens.

394
00:26:22,114 --> 00:26:24,483
(calm music)

395
00:26:24,483 --> 00:26:25,451
- I love this city.

396
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:28,520
- Would you like
 some coffee or soda?

397
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,355
I have soda.

398
00:26:30,623 --> 00:26:32,291
- Do you think I'm attractive?

399
00:26:32,291 --> 00:26:33,359
- Or just some water?

400
00:26:34,694 --> 00:26:35,628
- Do you think I'm beautiful?

401
00:26:35,628 --> 00:26:37,096
- [Andre] I'll make some coffee.

402
00:26:37,096 --> 00:26:38,297
- Do you?

403
00:26:38,297 --> 00:26:39,465
- Sure.

404
00:26:39,465 --> 00:26:40,700
- Do you want to kiss me?

405
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:43,035
- Janie you had way
 too much to drink.

406
00:26:43,035 --> 00:26:44,270
- You know you wan to.

407
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:45,171
That's all you really
 want from me right?

408
00:26:46,372 --> 00:26:49,842
- Listen you don't know
anything about my life.

409
00:26:49,842 --> 00:26:51,944
You don't even know who I am.

410
00:26:51,944 --> 00:26:54,213
You're drunk, that's not my way.

411
00:26:55,347 --> 00:26:58,517
(contemplative music)

412
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:33,585
(knocking on door)

413
00:27:35,354 --> 00:27:36,388
- Hi.
- Andre.

414
00:27:36,388 --> 00:27:38,024
Gosh what time is it?

415
00:27:38,024 --> 00:27:39,759
- You want me to
come back later?

416
00:27:39,759 --> 00:27:40,860
- No no that's fine.

417
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:42,228
What you need?

418
00:27:42,228 --> 00:27:44,697
- It's Thursday we're
scheduled to work out remember?

419
00:27:44,697 --> 00:27:47,834
- Oh shit Andre I
 completely forgot.

420
00:27:47,834 --> 00:27:49,135
Can we do it tomorrow?

421
00:27:49,135 --> 00:27:50,469
- No problem.

422
00:27:50,469 --> 00:27:52,371
- I'm sorry you
 came all this way.

423
00:27:52,371 --> 00:27:54,807
- It's okay I wanted
 to see you anyway.

424
00:27:54,807 --> 00:27:58,711
(contemplative music)

425
00:27:58,711 --> 00:27:59,946
- You should have called.

426
00:28:02,614 --> 00:28:03,449
- For the suit.

427
00:28:06,786 --> 00:28:08,154
- See you later?

428
00:28:08,154 --> 00:28:08,955
- Sure.

429
00:28:13,059 --> 00:28:15,427
(club dance music)

430
00:28:15,427 --> 00:28:18,364
- Ooh mama look at you.

431
00:28:18,364 --> 00:28:22,368
Angel from God 10 o'clock.

432
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:25,772
Work it mama, Billy
 Boy's in Heaven.

433
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:28,841
Doggy.

434
00:28:28,841 --> 00:28:31,744
(club dance music)

435
00:28:33,312 --> 00:28:35,481
- Ho ho, ho ho ho, hey.

436
00:28:35,481 --> 00:28:36,448
- Hey.

437
00:28:36,448 --> 00:28:37,383
- Hey you know you didn't have

438
00:28:37,383 --> 00:28:38,918
that blue dress on in my dream.

439
00:28:38,918 --> 00:28:39,819
- Oh stop.

440
00:28:40,753 --> 00:28:43,655
(muted club music)

441
00:28:45,958 --> 00:28:46,959
- Hey.
 - Hey.

442
00:28:47,794 --> 00:28:48,627
- How you doing?

443
00:28:48,627 --> 00:28:49,929
- Good.

444
00:28:49,929 --> 00:28:51,230
- I was watching you out there.

445
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:52,164
- Oh really?

446
00:28:52,164 --> 00:28:53,132
- Yeah you dance pretty well.

447
00:28:53,132 --> 00:28:54,366
- Thanks.

448
00:28:54,366 --> 00:28:56,002
- So what do you
 do, you got a job?

449
00:28:56,869 --> 00:28:58,604
- I take acting classes.

450
00:28:58,604 --> 00:29:00,239
- Oh you're an actress?

451
00:29:00,239 --> 00:29:01,740
Must be pretty tough out there.

452
00:29:03,342 --> 00:29:04,443
But not for you right?

453
00:29:05,311 --> 00:29:06,779
You're so beautiful.

454
00:29:06,779 --> 00:29:10,449
No I mean it, your face,
 your body, the way you move.

455
00:29:11,884 --> 00:29:14,553
You have an air of classic
 serene grace about you.

456
00:29:14,553 --> 00:29:15,421
It overwhelms me.

457
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:17,824
- I've seen you
 somewhere before.

458
00:29:17,824 --> 00:29:19,591
- Oh yeah I'm in the movies.

459
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:20,426
- Oh.

460
00:29:20,426 --> 00:29:21,861
- No I'm kidding.

461
00:29:21,861 --> 00:29:23,262
I own the place.

462
00:29:23,262 --> 00:29:24,330
- Oh really?

463
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:25,164
- Yeah.

464
00:29:26,565 --> 00:29:29,735
Have you ever seen something
 so incredibly beautiful,

465
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:34,373
so magnificent you
 just had to turn away?

466
00:29:35,441 --> 00:29:37,409
- You're just saying that.

467
00:29:37,409 --> 00:29:39,245
- No I mean it.

468
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,114
Listen.

469
00:29:44,416 --> 00:29:47,086
You want to make some money?

470
00:29:47,086 --> 00:29:48,520
- What do you mean?

471
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,388
- What do I mean?

472
00:29:51,057 --> 00:29:51,891
You hustling me?

473
00:29:53,059 --> 00:29:56,662
- [Girl] How much money
are we talking about?

474
00:29:56,662 --> 00:29:58,397
- [Radio] Code red main area.

475
00:29:58,397 --> 00:30:02,234
(people shouting in distance)

476
00:30:03,469 --> 00:30:08,474
(punches landing)
 (grunting)

477
00:30:14,947 --> 00:30:18,284
- Where the hell have you been?

478
00:30:18,284 --> 00:30:19,952
Get him out of here.

479
00:30:21,153 --> 00:30:22,688
Go on get him out.

480
00:30:22,688 --> 00:30:25,391
(dramatic music)

481
00:30:25,391 --> 00:30:28,060
(water running)

482
00:30:29,095 --> 00:30:29,929
- How you doing?

483
00:30:29,929 --> 00:30:33,765
- Alright.

484
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:36,202
- Fuck me.

485
00:30:36,202 --> 00:30:38,170
- Christ you been stabbed
 you dumb mother fucker.

486
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:39,805
EMS here on ASAP.

487
00:30:39,805 --> 00:30:40,639
Come on.

488
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:47,980
- Okay antibiotics three
times a day after meals.

489
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:50,416
And take two of these
 as needed for pain.

490
00:30:50,416 --> 00:30:52,151
But no more than
 two every four hours

491
00:30:52,151 --> 00:30:53,886
and no more than eight a day.

492
00:30:53,886 --> 00:30:55,421
- Thanks.

493
00:30:55,421 --> 00:30:58,657
Keep the pain pills but
 I'll take the antibiotics.

494
00:30:58,657 --> 00:30:59,525
- Suit yourself.

495
00:31:01,027 --> 00:31:03,529
You know you're a very
 lucky man Mr. Siegel.

496
00:31:03,529 --> 00:31:05,898
- Since we're friends
 you should call me Andre.

497
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:08,467
- I beg your pardon?

498
00:31:08,467 --> 00:31:11,337
- [Andre] You stitched
 up wounds, makes
 you my friend right?

499
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:14,273
- It was nothing personal.

500
00:31:14,273 --> 00:31:15,374
I'm just doing my job.

501
00:31:16,408 --> 00:31:18,044
- Doesn't matter.

502
00:31:18,044 --> 00:31:20,947
- Look Mr. Siegel
 when I stitched you up

503
00:31:20,947 --> 00:31:24,150
I found scar tissue from
 five other guns shot wounds,

504
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:27,386
and scars from lacerations
that appear to be knife wounds.

505
00:31:27,386 --> 00:31:28,988
We counted 14 total.

506
00:31:30,489 --> 00:31:32,424
Your X-ray shows several
foreign metallic objects

507
00:31:32,424 --> 00:31:35,261
and your ribs look like they
 were set by a blind man.

508
00:31:35,261 --> 00:31:38,464
In my opinion,
 since we're friends,

509
00:31:39,831 --> 00:31:41,700
maybe you should consider
 a new line of work.

510
00:31:42,601 --> 00:31:44,636
- See only a friend would care.

511
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:49,275
- You can put your shirt on now.

512
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:53,912
(suspenseful music)

513
00:32:23,509 --> 00:32:26,112
- [Papa] I hope this letter
 finds you in good health.

514
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:28,314
Do not be angry with Emily.

515
00:32:28,314 --> 00:32:31,850
When she contacted us we
begged for your address.

516
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:36,322
We think of you every day,
 Mother speaks of nothing else.

517
00:32:36,322 --> 00:32:38,690
She worries she will
 never see you again.

518
00:32:39,825 --> 00:32:42,461
I am aware of the
 difficulties of life.

519
00:32:43,595 --> 00:32:46,065
I simply wish to
 remind of your home

520
00:32:46,065 --> 00:32:49,868
and family who
 love you very much.

521
00:32:49,868 --> 00:32:53,239
Please write your
 mother, adieu Papa.

522
00:32:54,706 --> 00:32:57,876
(contemplative music)

523
00:33:35,047 --> 00:33:37,383
(phone beeps)

524
00:33:37,383 --> 00:33:39,151
- [Phone] Yes hello.

525
00:33:39,151 --> 00:33:39,985
Hello?

526
00:33:42,121 --> 00:33:43,722
Hello.

527
00:33:43,722 --> 00:33:46,892
(contemplative music)

528
00:33:54,133 --> 00:33:55,734
- You look like a man who
 could use some good news.

529
00:33:55,734 --> 00:33:56,568
Come on.

530
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:01,240
Here she is.

531
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:06,245
750 CC's, in line four
 cylinder, custom fit pipes.

532
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:10,416
Zero to 60 in 3.6 seconds,
 that is if you can hang on.

533
00:34:10,416 --> 00:34:11,550
- It's a beauty.

534
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:13,619
- Yeah, it's not
American but it's yours.

535
00:34:14,753 --> 00:34:16,322
That is after 36 easy payments.

536
00:34:17,189 --> 00:34:18,624
- Thank you bro.

537
00:34:18,624 --> 00:34:19,858
- Andre some guy saying
he licks Foreign Legion

538
00:34:19,858 --> 00:34:20,926
tearing up the place.

539
00:34:23,662 --> 00:34:25,797
- Dumb bastard, homo
 bunch of faggots.

540
00:34:25,797 --> 00:34:28,300
(punch lands)

541
00:34:29,935 --> 00:34:31,703
I'm not leaving until
 I finish my drink.

542
00:34:32,938 --> 00:34:37,943
- [Andre] Yeah I know him.

543
00:34:38,677 --> 00:34:39,878
Milo, God damned--

544
00:34:39,878 --> 00:34:41,046
- About God damned time.

545
00:34:42,714 --> 00:34:44,416
- Buenos dias bro.
 - It's good man.

546
00:34:46,652 --> 00:34:47,653
- We'll see you guys later.

547
00:34:53,692 --> 00:34:54,526
- Remember Luke Nealy?

548
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:59,030
Crazy fuck.

549
00:34:59,030 --> 00:34:59,865
And Jenkins?

550
00:35:01,667 --> 00:35:02,501
Pastoneck?

551
00:35:03,969 --> 00:35:04,770
Sims?

552
00:35:07,273 --> 00:35:09,475
Half the men in those
 pictures are dead now.

553
00:35:11,243 --> 00:35:12,278
- Sims have any kids?

554
00:35:13,879 --> 00:35:15,947
- Boy and a girl, London.

555
00:35:18,184 --> 00:35:19,017
- Where are you set to go?

556
00:35:21,853 --> 00:35:24,323
- Strafco's monster
 spotted nationals.

557
00:35:24,323 --> 00:35:26,892
Mostly Albanian,
 some in the woods.

558
00:35:26,892 --> 00:35:30,596
We oversee their training,
 also some field experience.

559
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:34,500
Christ every kid
 over 15 has a rifle.

560
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:35,467
We go in two weeks.

561
00:35:37,002 --> 00:35:38,036
- And who's paying?

562
00:35:38,036 --> 00:35:39,538
- That's the best part.

563
00:35:39,538 --> 00:35:42,374
It's government funded all
 handled electronically.

564
00:35:42,374 --> 00:35:44,810
They advance the money
 straight to your account.

565
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:46,745
No money's there you don't go.

566
00:35:46,745 --> 00:35:49,715
It's hot over there
 Andre, I'd like you there.

567
00:35:51,817 --> 00:35:53,151
- Things have changed Milo.

568
00:35:54,586 --> 00:35:55,421
I have a roof over my head now.

569
00:35:57,223 --> 00:35:58,156
I haven't shot in a long time

570
00:35:58,156 --> 00:35:59,425
and it doesn't bother me a bit.

571
00:36:00,559 --> 00:36:02,093
- I need you on my flank Andre.

572
00:36:04,363 --> 00:36:05,431
- Give me a couple days.

573
00:36:05,431 --> 00:36:06,265
- You got a week.

574
00:36:07,433 --> 00:36:09,435
I go to San Diego to see
a man about ordinance.

575
00:36:09,435 --> 00:36:10,602
I get back we go.

576
00:36:10,602 --> 00:36:13,472
- I'll think it over.

577
00:36:13,472 --> 00:36:15,874
I don't understand
 this hesitancy.

578
00:36:15,874 --> 00:36:19,778
A man used to be revered
when he went to war.

579
00:36:19,778 --> 00:36:21,880
People today just can't
take the violence.

580
00:36:22,714 --> 00:36:23,615
Makes them queasy.

581
00:36:25,851 --> 00:36:27,753
You're a freak of nature Andre.

582
00:36:29,221 --> 00:36:31,590
You don't belong here
 anymore than I do.

583
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:34,760
(contemplative music)

584
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:54,045
- Hey Andre.

585
00:36:55,681 --> 00:36:56,882
- See you later.

586
00:36:56,882 --> 00:36:58,350
- Hey.
 - Hi.

587
00:36:58,350 --> 00:36:59,184
- How you been?

588
00:36:59,184 --> 00:37:00,118
- Good.

589
00:37:00,118 --> 00:37:01,287
Where are you running to?

590
00:37:01,287 --> 00:37:02,120
- Nowhere.

591
00:37:03,322 --> 00:37:05,357
I've not seen you around much.

592
00:37:05,357 --> 00:37:06,758
- Yeah I'm sorry.

593
00:37:06,758 --> 00:37:08,193
- What you been up to?

594
00:37:08,193 --> 00:37:09,295
- Not much.

595
00:37:09,295 --> 00:37:10,128
- Not much?

596
00:37:10,128 --> 00:37:11,363
- No.

597
00:37:11,363 --> 00:37:12,764
- It's good to see you.

598
00:37:12,764 --> 00:37:13,599
You want to walk?

599
00:37:20,806 --> 00:37:22,808
- Look I think I need
 to apologize here.

600
00:37:24,876 --> 00:37:27,279
I said some things
 and I'm sorry.

601
00:37:28,314 --> 00:37:29,381
I was out of control.

602
00:37:30,549 --> 00:37:32,584
- It's okay, don't
 worry about it.

603
00:37:32,584 --> 00:37:36,355
- I was hurt and
 angry and very drunk.

604
00:37:36,355 --> 00:37:39,024
And I don't take
 rejection very well.

605
00:37:39,024 --> 00:37:39,991
I thought you were
 pushing me away

606
00:37:39,991 --> 00:37:41,627
because you didn't like me.

607
00:37:41,627 --> 00:37:46,298
- No that's not it.

608
00:37:47,933 --> 00:37:49,435
- How did you get those scars?

609
00:37:50,736 --> 00:37:52,371
- There's not much to tell.

610
00:37:52,371 --> 00:37:55,874
I got wounded, the wounds
 healed and the left scars.

611
00:37:55,874 --> 00:37:56,708
That's it.

612
00:37:58,209 --> 00:38:00,145
- You've seen a lot
 of death haven't you?

613
00:38:00,145 --> 00:38:01,847
- It's unavoidable sometimes.

614
00:38:05,083 --> 00:38:08,354
- I just wanted a fair
 chance like a tryout.

615
00:38:09,721 --> 00:38:13,191
- Is that why you came here?

616
00:38:13,191 --> 00:38:15,661
- Yeah, I just didn't want
 to be a corny old mother

617
00:38:15,661 --> 00:38:17,829
with a permanent
 headache and bad hair.

618
00:38:18,964 --> 00:38:20,198
- You'll miss it someday.

619
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:24,470
(contemplative music)

620
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:51,730
- I'll never felt
 anything like that.

621
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:52,664
It's like flying.

622
00:38:54,032 --> 00:38:55,166
The wind and the noise.

623
00:38:57,603 --> 00:38:58,437
It's incredible.

624
00:39:01,573 --> 00:39:03,975
Do you ever feel like
 we're alone in this world?

625
00:39:03,975 --> 00:39:04,810
- Yeah.

626
00:39:07,779 --> 00:39:09,815
- I feel like I'm different
 from everybody else.

627
00:39:11,016 --> 00:39:13,051
Like I have a destiny
to fulfill or something.

628
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:15,721
Do you ever feel that way?

629
00:39:15,721 --> 00:39:16,722
- [Andre] Sometimes.

630
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,992
- I know I can make it out here.

631
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,862
I just need someone
 to believe in me.

632
00:39:25,464 --> 00:39:26,665
- I believe in you.

633
00:39:28,734 --> 00:39:30,502
- Do you?

634
00:39:30,502 --> 00:39:31,703
- Yeah.

635
00:39:31,703 --> 00:39:34,873
(contemplative music)

636
00:39:54,426 --> 00:39:57,596
(club dance music)

637
00:39:57,596 --> 00:39:58,530
- Beer.

638
00:39:58,530 --> 00:40:01,199
- [Red] Hey Mark get him a beer.

639
00:40:01,199 --> 00:40:04,102
(club dance music)

640
00:40:18,283 --> 00:40:19,117
- Yo Junior!

641
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:21,086
Junior Lopez!

642
00:40:22,721 --> 00:40:23,989
You killed my sister!

643
00:40:28,126 --> 00:40:30,161
Come down here you
 fucking coward!

644
00:40:30,161 --> 00:40:32,097
(glass shattering)

645
00:40:32,097 --> 00:40:34,533
(punch lands)

646
00:40:34,533 --> 00:40:37,102
(tense music)

647
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:46,044
What did you hit me for?

648
00:40:46,044 --> 00:40:47,012
- You threw a glass.

649
00:40:47,012 --> 00:40:48,246
What do you want me to do then?

650
00:40:48,246 --> 00:40:50,849
(tense music)

651
00:40:50,849 --> 00:40:51,983
- You no my mother
 won't leave the house

652
00:40:51,983 --> 00:40:53,451
'cause she can't stop crying?

653
00:40:54,653 --> 00:40:57,155
You know my father
 won't speak at all?

654
00:40:57,155 --> 00:40:59,891
She was 15, just a little girl.

655
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:04,496
He whored out my
baby sister man.

656
00:41:05,664 --> 00:41:07,566
I had to identify her
body in the parking lot

657
00:41:07,566 --> 00:41:08,399
'cause she OD'd.

658
00:41:09,434 --> 00:41:10,669
- Go home.

659
00:41:10,669 --> 00:41:13,038
Be with your family
 they need you now, go.

660
00:41:18,677 --> 00:41:19,978
* True love

661
00:41:19,978 --> 00:41:23,815
* I want to hold you feel you

662
00:41:26,151 --> 00:41:26,985
- Andre.

663
00:41:29,287 --> 00:41:30,922
From Junior.

664
00:41:30,922 --> 00:41:33,925
(suspenseful music)

665
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:36,595
- What for?

666
00:41:36,595 --> 00:41:38,930
- It's his way of
 saying thank you.

667
00:41:38,930 --> 00:41:39,898
- For doing my job?

668
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:43,434
- You really think Rex buys
 Harleys on 150 plus tips?

669
00:41:44,402 --> 00:41:45,236
Get out of here.

670
00:41:53,244 --> 00:41:54,846
- I'm thinking about highlights.

671
00:41:54,846 --> 00:41:56,782
- They use lemon
 juice on Baywatch.

672
00:41:56,782 --> 00:41:58,283
- [Janie] How do you know?

673
00:41:58,283 --> 00:41:59,384
- 'Cause I dated
 one of the actors.

674
00:41:59,384 --> 00:42:00,919
- Which one?

675
00:42:00,919 --> 00:42:03,955
- As if, he was like an
 extra in maybe one episode.

676
00:42:03,955 --> 00:42:06,091
- Two, and he had lines.

677
00:42:06,091 --> 00:42:07,993
- Ah, he's drowning.

678
00:42:07,993 --> 00:42:08,827
Not quote lines.

679
00:42:10,862 --> 00:42:12,197
- SAG card though.

680
00:42:12,197 --> 00:42:13,599
- He got a SAG card for that?

681
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:14,465
- Yeah.

682
00:42:14,465 --> 00:42:16,802
But he's a bum you know.

683
00:42:16,802 --> 00:42:18,904
I don't want to talk about him.

684
00:42:18,904 --> 00:42:20,105
What's up with bouncer boy?

685
00:42:20,105 --> 00:42:21,940
Are you guys serious?

686
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:23,408
- He's not a boy, he's a man.

687
00:42:24,876 --> 00:42:25,711
- Did you do him?

688
00:42:27,579 --> 00:42:28,780
- None of your business.

689
00:42:29,915 --> 00:42:30,749
- Sorry.

690
00:42:32,951 --> 00:42:34,119
- [Red] Hello my dear.

691
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:36,822
- Hey Babe why don't you
 get us something to drink?

692
00:42:36,822 --> 00:42:37,656
- Okay.

693
00:42:41,459 --> 00:42:42,828
Hello ladies.

694
00:42:46,264 --> 00:42:48,499
Enjoying the sun ladies?

695
00:42:48,499 --> 00:42:49,567
- Yeah it's nice.

696
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:51,670
- This is my building.

697
00:42:53,004 --> 00:42:53,839
I'm Junior Lopez.

698
00:42:56,307 --> 00:42:57,676
You know what I told Annie?

699
00:42:59,477 --> 00:43:01,747
I said Annie have you
 ever seen something

700
00:43:01,747 --> 00:43:04,850
so incredibly beautiful,
something so stunning,

701
00:43:06,718 --> 00:43:08,186
that you just had to turn away?

702
00:43:08,186 --> 00:43:11,522
It's just instinct
 to just go (growls)

703
00:43:13,458 --> 00:43:15,393
That's how I felt
 when I first saw you.

704
00:43:16,795 --> 00:43:17,595
No I'm serious.

705
00:43:19,698 --> 00:43:21,466
- Janie Chambers,
 it's my pleasure.

706
00:43:22,834 --> 00:43:25,170
- Janie Chambers I like that.

707
00:43:25,170 --> 00:43:26,604
Well listen we gotta go.

708
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:28,239
Why don't you stop by me
 club tonight and be my guest.

709
00:43:28,239 --> 00:43:29,708
- Have a little dinner,
a little dancing?

710
00:43:29,708 --> 00:43:31,209
- Sure.
- I don't know.

711
00:43:31,209 --> 00:43:32,678
- Hey come on you never
 know who's gonna be there.

712
00:43:32,678 --> 00:43:34,212
- Hey don't worry about it Red.

713
00:43:35,647 --> 00:43:39,617
We're no boy scouts but I'm
 sure you'll have a good time.

714
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:41,452
- Sure okay.
 - Alright.

715
00:43:48,393 --> 00:43:50,896
(phone beeps)

716
00:43:52,764 --> 00:43:54,032
- [Phone] Hello.

717
00:43:54,032 --> 00:43:57,969
(speaking in foreign language)

718
00:44:05,944 --> 00:44:08,880
(knocking on door)

719
00:44:11,883 --> 00:44:14,019
- So this is where you live.

720
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:16,822
How's work?

721
00:44:16,822 --> 00:44:18,389
Michael says you're doing well.

722
00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:20,525
- What do you need?

723
00:44:24,796 --> 00:44:26,765
- I heard you're fucking
some little bitch.

724
00:44:28,199 --> 00:44:30,869
- You gotta get your
 hearing checked.

725
00:44:30,869 --> 00:44:32,137
- So you're not.

726
00:44:32,137 --> 00:44:32,971
- No.

727
00:44:37,142 --> 00:44:39,644
- Andre where do you see
yourself in five years?

728
00:44:40,846 --> 00:44:41,679
- I don't know.

729
00:44:43,081 --> 00:44:45,116
- I don't think L.A.
 is the town for you.

730
00:44:46,317 --> 00:44:48,453
- Just a city like
 any other city.

731
00:44:48,453 --> 00:44:49,921
- No listen to me.

732
00:44:49,921 --> 00:44:51,890
This city can do
 strange things to you.

733
00:44:53,424 --> 00:44:55,393
It can make you do things
 that you wouldn't normally do.

734
00:44:58,830 --> 00:45:01,900
Call me if you need
 anything won't you?

735
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:03,835
- You did enough already.

736
00:45:03,835 --> 00:45:06,271
(calm music)

737
00:45:24,589 --> 00:45:29,294
You know they call it
 magic hour out here.

738
00:45:29,294 --> 00:45:31,096
- I can't keep seeing you Andre.

739
00:45:31,096 --> 00:45:32,497
- Why is there someone else?

740
00:45:34,665 --> 00:45:37,668
- He cares about me.

741
00:45:37,668 --> 00:45:40,906
And he wants to help
 me with my career.

742
00:45:42,007 --> 00:45:45,176
(contemplative music)

743
00:45:47,846 --> 00:45:50,415
(upbeat music)

744
00:46:34,392 --> 00:46:37,228
(club dance music)

745
00:46:37,228 --> 00:46:38,096
- What do you go there?

746
00:46:38,096 --> 00:46:38,964
- Rolex.

747
00:46:38,964 --> 00:46:40,465
- Yeah, is it yours?

748
00:46:40,465 --> 00:46:42,467
- I'm buying it cheap too.

749
00:46:42,467 --> 00:46:44,535
They were selling
 them for 900 bucks.

750
00:46:44,535 --> 00:46:46,271
Sold it right off
 the factory floor.

751
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:47,839
Look right there on the
 back ain't no serial number.

752
00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:49,640
You see that?

753
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:52,343
Got it brand new in a
 little shop or something.

754
00:46:52,343 --> 00:46:55,513
Word has it if you put it
 on it'll try to fuck him.

755
00:46:55,513 --> 00:46:56,547
- Just don't know what I'm gonna

756
00:46:56,547 --> 00:46:58,583
do with such a sweet sweet deal.

757
00:46:58,583 --> 00:47:00,718
- Listen Billy I won't
lie, this is where I say

758
00:47:00,718 --> 00:47:03,454
take or leave it or shove it
 up your ass, I don't care.

759
00:47:05,023 --> 00:47:05,857
Hey Andre what's up?

760
00:47:08,026 --> 00:47:10,361
- What the fuck
 is wrong with him?

761
00:47:10,361 --> 00:47:11,662
- Maybe he just
 bought a fake Rolex.

762
00:47:13,965 --> 00:47:17,135
Andre, walk with me, come on.

763
00:47:17,135 --> 00:47:20,071
(muted club music)

764
00:47:20,972 --> 00:47:22,173
What's up man?

765
00:47:22,173 --> 00:47:22,974
You don't seem like your
usual cheerful self.

766
00:47:24,209 --> 00:47:25,476
Need to borrow some money?

767
00:47:26,744 --> 00:47:29,680
Been doing some blow to
keep you on your toes?

768
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:32,183
Chumps like to take some
 bunk just to keep it tight.

769
00:47:32,183 --> 00:47:33,885
Next thing you know
 they're stealing

770
00:47:33,885 --> 00:47:34,719
from the till just
 to keep it going.

771
00:47:34,719 --> 00:47:36,287
- I'm just tired man.

772
00:47:36,287 --> 00:47:37,855
- Yeah?

773
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:39,190
It's girl trouble isn't it?

774
00:47:40,358 --> 00:47:41,859
Listen man you're
 off to a good start.

775
00:47:41,859 --> 00:47:43,494
The crowd likes you,
 Michael likes you.

776
00:47:43,494 --> 00:47:44,930
Fuck I even like you.

777
00:47:44,930 --> 00:47:47,698
These are good things
 Andre stay focused.

778
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:48,566
Don't fuck up.

779
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:51,202
- Anything else?

780
00:47:51,202 --> 00:47:54,105
(muted club music)

781
00:47:57,242 --> 00:48:00,411
(contemplative music)

782
00:48:09,020 --> 00:48:12,924
Get a grip Andre.

783
00:48:12,924 --> 00:48:14,892
She's just a fucking girl.

784
00:48:16,027 --> 00:48:18,263
She's just a girl man.

785
00:48:18,263 --> 00:48:22,000
(muted club music)

786
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,801
- It's not a good idea
to have them here boss.

787
00:48:23,801 --> 00:48:25,103
They're just looking to
 start trouble with Junior.

788
00:48:26,604 --> 00:48:27,838
- Give me a minute.

789
00:48:27,838 --> 00:48:28,873
If they don't calm
 down back me up.

790
00:48:29,774 --> 00:48:30,775
Hey Coco.

791
00:48:32,010 --> 00:48:33,778
Coco can you keep
 it down a little?

792
00:48:33,778 --> 00:48:36,814
I appreciate your

793
00:48:36,814 --> 00:48:38,483
- [Coco] Why you busting

794
00:48:38,483 --> 00:48:39,985

795
00:48:39,985 --> 00:48:41,719
I appreciate your business
 alright, just a warning.

796
00:48:41,719 --> 00:48:42,954
- I spend a lot money in here.

797
00:48:42,954 --> 00:48:44,089
- [Michael] Thank

798
00:48:44,089 --> 00:48:45,957
- Fucking Liberace faggot.

799
00:48:45,957 --> 00:48:48,459
- One more bottle
breaks they're history.

800
00:48:48,459 --> 00:48:49,694
- [Coco] Hey where's

801
00:48:49,694 --> 00:48:51,029
Is there a waitress
 in this fucking place?

802
00:48:51,029 --> 00:48:52,630
- That's it.

803
00:48:53,631 --> 00:48:55,900
Alright guys, time to go.

804
00:48:57,068 --> 00:48:59,537
- We're just having
 ourselves a good time.

805
00:48:59,537 --> 00:49:01,406
- Hell I know you're

806
00:49:01,406 --> 00:49:03,808
but good time's over,
 you guys gotta to go.

807
00:49:03,808 --> 00:49:05,010
Let's keep it dignified.

808
00:49:05,977 --> 00:49:08,613
(muted club music)

809
00:49:08,613 --> 00:49:10,115
- It's Rex isn't it?

810
00:49:11,983 --> 00:49:13,284
Isn't that him?

811
00:49:13,284 --> 00:49:15,386
(muted club music)

812
00:49:15,386 --> 00:49:16,221
Well Mr. Rex.

813
00:49:18,023 --> 00:49:18,856
Come on my man.

814
00:49:20,458 --> 00:49:23,328
Look I take this to be cool

815
00:49:25,130 --> 00:49:26,364
But fight isn't with him.

816
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:32,303
Besides me and the guys here

817
00:49:33,471 --> 00:49:35,040
we're just having a
 little bit of fun.

818
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:39,777
You know, fucking around.

819
00:49:39,777 --> 00:49:41,012

820
00:49:41,012 --> 00:49:45,750
(punches landing)
 (dramatic music)

821
00:49:48,653 --> 00:49:49,854
This ain't over.

823
00:49:53,291 --> 00:49:56,194

824
00:50:00,398 --> 00:50:02,233
Get off me mother fucker.

826
00:50:15,213 --> 00:50:16,147
You're fucking dead.

827
00:50:17,315 --> 00:50:21,018
Nobody touches me.

828
00:50:21,886 --> 00:50:24,222
We going death row tonight.

829
00:50:24,222 --> 00:50:26,023
You're fucking dead.

830
00:50:26,023 --> 00:50:29,260
- Get on out of here before

831
00:50:30,795 --> 00:50:31,996
- Okay guys tool up.

832

00:50:43,541 --> 00:50:44,375
- Call them back.

838
00:50:45,576 --> 00:50:46,411
- What do you mean

839
00:50:46,411 --> 00:50:47,245
They busted up the club.

840
00:50:47,245 --> 00:50:48,213
- Call them back--

841
00:50:48,213 --> 00:50:48,913

842
00:50:48,913 --> 00:50:50,215

(dramatic music)

848
00:51:09,734 --> 00:51:11,469
- First rule of a gun
 fight, bring a gun.

849
00:51:11,469 --> 00:51:13,003
Ain't that right Rex?

850
00:51:13,003 --> 00:51:16,241
- Let's drop that hill billy
 shit just for five minutes.

851
00:51:16,241 --> 00:51:17,808
- [Billy] He needs to cool down.

852
00:51:18,809 --> 00:51:20,044
- [Andre] What if they don't?

853
00:51:20,044 --> 00:51:21,712
- Then we do our jobs.

854
00:51:21,712 --> 00:51:23,013
Get back to your sections.

855
00:51:24,815 --> 00:51:26,016

00:51:30,155 --> 00:51:31,189
- It's running good.

859
00:51:31,189 --> 00:51:32,490
- You up for a ride?

860
00:51:32,490 --> 00:51:34,592
Ain't been to TJ for a while.

861
00:51:34,592 --> 00:51:37,195
(upbeat music)

862
00:51:41,732 --> 00:51:44,202
Man she's cute but
 she ain't that cute.

863
00:51:44,202 --> 00:51:45,803
Now we got a job to do.

864
00:51:45,803 --> 00:51:48,406

865
00:51:53,744 --> 00:51:54,945

- How?

868
00:52:02,853 --> 00:52:04,054
- He knows people.

869
00:52:04,054 --> 00:52:05,590
- Who does he know?

870
00:52:05,590 --> 00:52:07,558
- Directors and producers.

871
00:52:07,558 --> 00:52:09,059
- Oh really?

872
00:52:09,059 --> 00:52:11,596
- Listen Andre

873
00:52:11,596 --> 00:52:13,598
Don't make this difficult okay.

874
00:52:13,598 --> 00:52:16,334
- He's no good for you.

875
00:52:16,334 --> 00:52:17,802
- Y'all have your ID's ready.

876
00:52:20,305 --> 00:52:23,641
Couple of fat boys keep
 cruising by scoping us out.

877
00:52:23,641 --> 00:52:26,277

00:52:34,519 --> 00:52:36,821
We're gonna keep it
 outside so you stay sharp.

882
00:52:37,722 --> 00:52:38,656
Do you hear me?

883
00:52:38,656 --> 00:52:39,790

888
00:52:59,644 --> 00:53:04,582
(guns firing)
 (all talking at once)

889

00:53:20,731 --> 00:53:23,434
Jesus just go go, get

00:53:25,936 --> 00:53:28,439
Come on, come on, get him off.

00:53:29,974 --> 00:53:32,643
Get him in the building.

Come on you guys move it.

895
00:53:34,011 --> 00:53:35,446
Come on.

896
00:53:35,446 --> 00:53:36,847
Watch your backs.

897
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:40,351
(sirens blaring)

898
00:53:40,351 --> 00:53:44,088

899
00:53:46,724 --> 00:53:49,827
(suspenseful music)

900
00:53:51,696 --> 00:53:52,530
- Mr. Siegel.

901
00:53:54,198 --> 00:53:55,032
Mr. Siegel?

902
00:53:56,767 --> 00:53:59,136
Can you hear me?

903
00:53:59,136 --> 00:54:01,171
(suspenseful music)

904
00:54:01,171 --> 00:54:02,139
- Andre remember?

905
00:54:04,575 --> 00:54:05,643
- Welcome back Andre.

906
00:54:07,211 --> 00:54:09,980
I just removed a nine millimeter
slug from your spleen.

907
00:54:12,383 --> 00:54:15,085
You're becoming a
 valued customer here.

908
00:54:16,421 --> 00:54:18,356
- How long am I gonna be here?

909
00:54:18,356 --> 00:54:19,624
- Oh about a week or two.

910
00:54:21,559 --> 00:54:22,393
You're strong.

911
00:54:23,994 --> 00:54:24,829
And very lucky.

912
00:54:26,364 --> 00:54:30,067
- Has anyone been
 looking for me?

913
00:54:30,067 --> 00:54:31,602
- Why are you avoiding someone?

914
00:54:33,037 --> 00:54:36,206
(contemplative music)

915
00:54:39,043 --> 00:54:40,210
- You know there's not
 one good looking nurse

916
00:54:40,210 --> 00:54:41,812
in this entire fucking hospital.

917
00:54:42,847 --> 00:54:44,315
- They heard you were coming.

918
00:54:45,783 --> 00:54:47,618
- I don't like them anyway
 they smell like chemicals.

919
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:51,456
You ever think about
 what we've done Andre?

920
00:54:52,690 --> 00:54:54,359
I don't mean the
 bad dreams I mean

921
00:54:54,359 --> 00:54:56,260
really think about
 the life we've led?

922
00:54:57,728 --> 00:54:58,629
Been a grand life.

923
00:54:59,797 --> 00:55:02,500
You and me, we've done
things that most people

924
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:04,569
can only imagine in
 their wildest dreams.

925
00:55:05,670 --> 00:55:06,871
You're not bullet proof.

926
00:55:08,038 --> 00:55:09,807
Remember after the
 Tootsie uprising

927
00:55:09,807 --> 00:55:11,075
when you caught miliaria?

928
00:55:11,942 --> 00:55:13,711
- Yeah, young and stupid.

929
00:55:15,346 --> 00:55:17,214
- I got you that
 village witch doctor.

930
00:55:18,716 --> 00:55:21,185
Told him I'd fix his Land
 Rover if he'd help you.

931
00:55:22,553 --> 00:55:24,054
- Guess I'm lucky to be alive.

932
00:55:25,790 --> 00:55:26,824
- Told him I was
going in to town

933
00:55:26,824 --> 00:55:28,426
for spares just never came back.

934
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:31,696
Probably put a curse on you.

935
00:55:31,696 --> 00:55:32,530
- Figures.

936
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:37,267
- You won't be coming
 with me will you?

937
00:55:40,871 --> 00:55:45,710
- No, not this time.

938
00:55:45,710 --> 00:55:47,745
I can't.

939
00:55:47,745 --> 00:55:49,246
- I can't make you.

940
00:55:49,246 --> 00:55:52,417
(contemplative music)

941
00:55:55,319 --> 00:55:56,554
- Milo.

942
00:55:56,554 --> 00:55:57,388
Milo.

943
00:55:59,123 --> 00:55:59,957
Watch your back.

944
00:56:01,158 --> 00:56:04,328
(contemplative music)

945
00:56:08,966 --> 00:56:10,401
- In the gut hey?

946
00:56:10,401 --> 00:56:11,235
That's too bad.

947
00:56:15,339 --> 00:56:20,344
Junior appreciates what
you've done for him.

948
00:56:21,546 --> 00:56:22,813
Sends his best, wishes
 you a speedy recovery.

949
00:56:24,549 --> 00:56:26,651
Wants you to go by and
 see him when you get done.

950
00:56:29,153 --> 00:56:32,022
You know I was in
 here three months ago.

951
00:56:32,022 --> 00:56:33,491
I got busted up in a fight.

952
00:56:33,491 --> 00:56:36,126
And Junior never sent nobody
 to come and check on me.

953
00:56:37,294 --> 00:56:39,830
Just thought you might
 want to know that.

954
00:56:39,830 --> 00:56:43,000
(contemplative music)

955
00:56:46,804 --> 00:56:48,839
(knocking on door)

956
00:56:48,839 --> 00:56:52,009
(contemplative music)

957
00:57:18,302 --> 00:57:19,303
(muted club music)

958
00:57:19,303 --> 00:57:21,005
- See I told them you'd be back.

959
00:57:22,172 --> 00:57:25,209
Rex said no but I said
 it'd take more than

960
00:57:25,209 --> 00:57:27,144
a bullet to keep old Andre away.

961
00:57:28,078 --> 00:57:29,880
Rex didn't I tell you?

962
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:30,815
- Do you ever shut up?

963
00:57:31,716 --> 00:57:32,950
It's good to have you back here.

964
00:57:32,950 --> 00:57:35,419
Okay you guys, let's
 get back to work.

965
00:57:35,419 --> 00:57:38,355
(muted club music)

966
00:57:39,924 --> 00:57:42,927
(club dance music)

967
00:57:45,630 --> 00:57:47,131
- Hey Junior wants to see you.

968
00:57:47,131 --> 00:57:48,165
- Right now?

969
00:57:48,165 --> 00:57:49,534
- Now, now.

970
00:57:49,534 --> 00:57:52,537
(club dance music)

971
00:57:53,370 --> 00:57:56,140
- Hey bud what's up?

972
00:57:56,140 --> 00:57:57,074
- Junior's waiting.

973
00:57:58,408 --> 00:57:59,777
- And what does Junior want?

974
00:57:59,777 --> 00:58:02,179
- He doesn't know 'cause
he hasn't seen him yet.

975
00:58:02,179 --> 00:58:05,883
(club dance music)

976
00:58:05,883 --> 00:58:08,886
- Sales are down and you need
 to do something about it.

977
00:58:08,886 --> 00:58:11,822
(muted club music)

978
00:58:13,624 --> 00:58:15,459
Andre sit.

979
00:58:19,997 --> 00:58:21,165
How you doing?

980
00:58:22,967 --> 00:58:25,169
He's always so serious.

981
00:58:25,169 --> 00:58:27,572
(muted club music)

982
00:58:27,572 --> 00:58:29,073
Here have a drink.

983
00:58:29,073 --> 00:58:31,976
(muted club music)

984
00:58:40,885 --> 00:58:41,786
I like loyalty.

985
00:58:43,053 --> 00:58:45,089
Loyalty is good.

986
00:58:45,089 --> 00:58:48,025
(muted club music)

987
00:58:50,394 --> 00:58:52,396
You know they say the
 key to immortality

988
00:58:53,698 --> 00:58:56,366
is to live a life
 worth remembering.

989
00:58:57,802 --> 00:59:01,538
That's what this is
all about, the journey.

990
00:59:04,074 --> 00:59:06,510
I grew up in the
 streets, big deal.

991
00:59:07,645 --> 00:59:09,580
We all come from somewhere.

992
00:59:09,580 --> 00:59:11,215
We've all been
 through something.

993
00:59:12,583 --> 00:59:15,219
We all have a secret
 to hide right?

994
00:59:17,254 --> 00:59:20,490
The difference is I'm in charge.

995
00:59:22,893 --> 00:59:25,029
Everything you see here
I've built on my own.

996
00:59:27,231 --> 00:59:30,200
You do your job and you'll
 learn a lot from me.

997
00:59:31,301 --> 00:59:34,204
(muted club music)

998
00:59:46,416 --> 00:59:48,318
(club dance music)

999
00:59:48,318 --> 00:59:49,286
- You know in his eyes
 you ain't earned that.

1000
00:59:49,286 --> 00:59:51,121
It's jut a retainer.

1001
00:59:51,121 --> 00:59:52,690
Pretty soon he'll
 snap his fingers

1002
00:59:52,690 --> 00:59:55,159
and expect you to come a
running, you comprende?

1003
00:59:56,661 --> 00:59:58,328
- It's just business.

1004
00:59:58,328 --> 01:00:01,231
(club dance music)

1005
01:00:04,769 --> 01:00:08,438
- Hey hey bouncer boy.

1006
01:00:08,438 --> 01:00:10,207
- Catch you later.

1007
01:00:10,207 --> 01:00:12,376
(club dance music)

1008
01:00:12,376 --> 01:00:13,210
- New look?

1009
01:00:15,045 --> 01:00:16,881
- Junior says I've blossomed.

1010
01:00:16,881 --> 01:00:17,915
Don't you like the new me?

1011
01:00:18,883 --> 01:00:20,217
- Change isn't always good.

1012
01:00:22,086 --> 01:00:23,187
- But it's inevitable.

1013
01:00:25,122 --> 01:00:25,956
- You moved.

1014
01:00:28,025 --> 01:00:29,660
I missed you.

1015
01:00:29,660 --> 01:00:30,828
- I'm sorry you're time was up.

1016
01:00:32,429 --> 01:00:35,365
(club dance music)

1017
01:00:35,365 --> 01:00:37,067
- The problem was him.

1018
01:00:37,067 --> 01:00:38,202
He doesn't have a plan.

1019
01:00:39,403 --> 01:00:41,538
Muslims usually
 never have a plan.

1020
01:00:41,538 --> 01:00:44,041
That's why I came here,
 to get away from the shit.

1021
01:00:45,542 --> 01:00:48,979
I want my own gym, an
 American business you know.

1022
01:00:48,979 --> 01:00:50,580
- Sounds really nice.

1023
01:00:50,580 --> 01:00:52,082
- You can be head of security.

1024
01:00:53,550 --> 01:00:54,852
Yeah.

1025
01:00:54,852 --> 01:00:56,620
I'm gonna make it nice, elegant.

1026
01:00:57,755 --> 01:01:00,024
I'm gonna have waiters
 wearing tuxedos,

1027
01:01:00,024 --> 01:01:02,626
valet parking, and
 personal trainers.

1028
01:01:02,626 --> 01:01:04,161
- Very good.

1029
01:01:04,161 --> 01:01:05,930
- You got to have a plan man.

1030
01:01:05,930 --> 01:01:10,067
A man without a plan is
not a man at all, right?

1031
01:01:10,067 --> 01:01:11,568
- That's right.

1032
01:01:11,568 --> 01:01:13,437
- [Maurice] What's
 your plan Andre?

1033
01:01:13,437 --> 01:01:14,438
- I' don't have one.

1034
01:01:16,540 --> 01:01:17,908
Thanks.

1035
01:01:17,908 --> 01:01:18,743
- Thanks.

1036
01:01:20,310 --> 01:01:22,579
(contemplative music)

1037
01:01:22,579 --> 01:01:23,413
- Permits.

1038
01:01:25,916 --> 01:01:26,751
Debt.

1039
01:01:29,153 --> 01:01:29,987
And disillusion.

1040
01:01:32,923 --> 01:01:35,926
Action.

1041
01:01:35,926 --> 01:01:36,927
It's begun.

1042
01:01:41,932 --> 01:01:44,869
(club dance music)

1043
01:01:52,442 --> 01:01:53,410
- Junior wants you.

1044
01:01:56,246 --> 01:01:57,247
- Watch your six man.

1045
01:02:00,217 --> 01:02:01,018
- [Junior] What
 do you want to do?

1046
01:02:01,018 --> 01:02:01,819
You want to go dancing?

1047
01:02:01,819 --> 01:02:02,652
- I want a drink.

1048
01:02:02,652 --> 01:02:03,587
- You want a drink.

1049
01:02:03,587 --> 01:02:04,521
I don't want you to drink.

1050
01:02:04,521 --> 01:02:05,355
- [Janie] Then sit down.

1051
01:02:05,355 --> 01:02:06,891
- I'll sit down.

1052
01:02:06,891 --> 01:02:08,058
I'll bite.

1053
01:02:08,058 --> 01:02:09,760
- That's fine.

1054
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:12,696
(muted club music)

1055
01:02:27,644 --> 01:02:29,579
- We're going on a little trip.

1056
01:02:29,579 --> 01:02:31,816
- Where to?

1057
01:02:31,816 --> 01:02:33,717
- You don't ask questions
 you do as you're told.

1058
01:02:33,717 --> 01:02:34,985
- Red Red Red be nice.

1059
01:02:34,985 --> 01:02:36,753
He's working on being in charge.

1060
01:02:37,687 --> 01:02:39,156
You learn that.

1061
01:02:39,156 --> 01:02:41,225
Don't ask questions do as
 you're told, nothing personal.

1062
01:02:41,225 --> 01:02:42,459
But here's the game.

1063
01:02:42,459 --> 01:02:44,428
I want you guys to
 go on a new lot.

1064
01:02:44,428 --> 01:02:49,333
Red if Andre fucks up it's
 Andre's ass, you fucked up.

1065
01:02:49,333 --> 01:02:54,338
Andre if Red fucks up
 it's still your ass.

1066
01:02:55,572 --> 01:02:56,740
But he never fucks up,
 that's why I like him.

1067
01:02:59,243 --> 01:03:00,277
Just need incentives.

1068
01:03:03,547 --> 01:03:04,748
- Let's go.

1069
01:03:11,755 --> 01:03:14,124
I don't like working with
 people I don't know you know.

1070
01:03:14,124 --> 01:03:15,926
I believe in
 promoting from within.

1071
01:03:15,926 --> 01:03:17,727
I also believe in loyalty.

1072
01:03:17,727 --> 01:03:20,097
I'm as loyal as an
 Irish fucking Setter.

1073
01:03:20,097 --> 01:03:21,498
That's why they call me Red.

1074
01:03:24,068 --> 01:03:25,569
I don't know you okay.

1075
01:03:25,569 --> 01:03:28,038
You're a bouncer at a club,
 I'm supposed to trust you?

1076
01:03:28,038 --> 01:03:29,339
You wonder why I complain?

1077
01:03:30,740 --> 01:03:32,376
I just want you to understand
 what I'm saying here okay.

1078
01:03:32,376 --> 01:03:36,613
I mean you know who I am right?

1079
01:03:36,613 --> 01:03:39,183
- Why don't you tell
 someone who gives a shit?

1080
01:03:39,183 --> 01:03:42,452
(suspenseful music)

1081
01:03:42,452 --> 01:03:44,421
- Look you wait here okay.

1082
01:03:44,421 --> 01:03:46,556
Nobody gets in alright Stretch.

1083
01:03:46,556 --> 01:03:49,559
(suspenseful music)

1084
01:04:06,776 --> 01:04:11,781
(grunting)
(dramatic music)

1085
01:04:28,865 --> 01:04:30,134
Lets go come on.

1086
01:04:30,134 --> 01:04:30,968
(gun firing)

1087
01:04:30,968 --> 01:04:31,801
Lets go.

1088
01:04:34,671 --> 01:04:37,441
(dramatic music)

1089
01:04:42,546 --> 01:04:45,649
(suspenseful music)

1090
01:05:28,358 --> 01:05:29,793
Fuck man.

1091
01:05:29,793 --> 01:05:31,528
I mean I've seen that
 Jolly Green Jerkoff

1092
01:05:31,528 --> 01:05:33,363
take out a whole
crew by himself.

1093
01:05:33,363 --> 01:05:34,999
I mean what you did back there.

1094
01:05:34,999 --> 01:05:36,133
- Forget about it.

1095
01:05:36,133 --> 01:05:37,334
It's no big deal.

1096
01:05:37,334 --> 01:05:42,039
- No no, hey, look
 I'll never forget it.

1097
01:05:43,207 --> 01:05:44,241
I told you I'm as
 loyal as a dog.

1098
01:05:44,241 --> 01:05:45,575
- Who was he?

1099
01:05:45,575 --> 01:05:47,211
- Marco.

1100
01:05:47,211 --> 01:05:49,613
Probably his slug they
 lifted from your ass.

1101
01:05:49,613 --> 01:05:50,981
One of Coco's boys trying to

1102
01:05:50,981 --> 01:05:53,417
move in on our
 regional holdings.

1103
01:05:53,417 --> 01:05:55,485
I keep telling them
 man it ain't worth it

1104
01:05:55,485 --> 01:05:57,454
- Was that the guy that shot me?

1105
01:05:57,454 --> 01:05:58,288
- Possible.

1106
01:05:59,323 --> 01:06:00,357
How's that for Karma?

1107
01:06:01,491 --> 01:06:02,759
- No shit.

1108
01:06:02,759 --> 01:06:05,929
(contemplative music)

1109
01:06:21,945 --> 01:06:22,779
- He did that?

1110
01:06:22,779 --> 01:06:24,314
He saved you?

1111
01:06:24,314 --> 01:06:25,215
What are fucking, you got a gun.

1112
01:06:25,215 --> 01:06:26,083
He save you?

1113
01:06:26,083 --> 01:06:27,684
That guy saved you?

1114
01:06:27,684 --> 01:06:29,219
What's wrong with you?

1115
01:06:29,219 --> 01:06:30,520
How can that guy save you?

1116
01:06:31,488 --> 01:06:34,058
(upbeat music)

1117
01:07:02,386 --> 01:07:05,755
(mortars exploding)
 (screaming in pain)

1118
01:07:05,755 --> 01:07:08,925
(machine guns firing)

1119
01:07:42,659 --> 01:07:45,829
(contemplative music)

1120
01:08:11,721 --> 01:08:12,789
- So intense.

1121
01:08:14,391 --> 01:08:15,892
- You're so lucky.

1122
01:08:17,327 --> 01:08:20,964
I haven't felt like this
 since I was a little kid.

1123
01:08:21,798 --> 01:08:23,900
- It's incredible.

1124
01:08:23,900 --> 01:08:25,001
I can feel everything.

1125
01:08:30,807 --> 01:08:33,477
It's like we're
 joined, like one.

1126
01:08:34,344 --> 01:08:37,514
(contemplative music)

1127
01:09:24,828 --> 01:09:26,330
- You'll burn in the sun.

1128
01:09:26,330 --> 01:09:29,533
You're pale skinned like me.

1129
01:09:29,533 --> 01:09:31,034
- You shouldn't be here Andre.

1130
01:09:32,802 --> 01:09:34,137
What happened to your head?

1131
01:09:35,472 --> 01:09:37,207
- I like this place.

1132
01:09:37,207 --> 01:09:41,077
Sun, flowers, smells.

1133
01:09:41,077 --> 01:09:44,080
Did you know they have a
juice bar in the lobby?

1134
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:44,981
- Yeah I know.

1135
01:09:46,082 --> 01:09:47,284
What are you doing here?

1136
01:09:48,685 --> 01:09:51,721
- I had time to think about
 what you said, remember?

1137
01:09:52,589 --> 01:09:53,923
- What was that?

1138
01:09:53,923 --> 01:09:57,026
- You said it's good to
have a goal, a dream.

1139
01:10:00,964 --> 01:10:02,332
- Was a high?

1140
01:10:02,332 --> 01:10:04,200
- You weren't even drunk.

1141
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:05,335
You were right.

1142
01:10:05,335 --> 01:10:07,070
There's a reason I'm here.

1143
01:10:07,070 --> 01:10:08,204
Just like there was a reason

1144
01:10:08,204 --> 01:10:10,139
for Africa,
 Thailand, and Bosnia.

1145
01:10:11,541 --> 01:10:14,210
There are reasons for everything
and you helped me see that.

1146
01:10:15,379 --> 01:10:16,980
- You're talking
 about fate Andre.

1147
01:10:18,348 --> 01:10:20,850
Fate is for losers who are
looking for something to blame.

1148
01:10:21,751 --> 01:10:23,453
I'm not the girl for you.

1149
01:10:23,453 --> 01:10:25,255
I've already made that choice.

1150
01:10:25,255 --> 01:10:27,991
(contemplative music)

1151
01:10:27,991 --> 01:10:29,793
- Did he do that to you?

1152
01:10:29,793 --> 01:10:31,194
- Just leave me alone Andre.

1153
01:10:36,433 --> 01:10:40,036
- Well Legionnaire if you
 are reading this I'm dead.

1154
01:10:40,036 --> 01:10:41,638
And Danny actually came through.

1155
01:10:42,839 --> 01:10:44,207
I could have used
 you here Andre.

1156
01:10:44,207 --> 01:10:45,675
It's different.

1157
01:10:45,675 --> 01:10:47,377
I'm the most
 experienced guy here.

1158
01:10:48,578 --> 01:10:50,714
I've enclosed a list
 of some families.

1159
01:10:50,714 --> 01:10:53,049
Split my dough like
 we talked about.

1160
01:10:53,049 --> 01:10:55,619
Take what you need and
 have a drink on old Milo.

1161
01:10:57,153 --> 01:10:59,423
We made a mistake in
 Africa old friend.

1162
01:10:59,423 --> 01:11:00,890
For all we've now done
 we should have done

1163
01:11:00,890 --> 01:11:02,892
a camera roll and
 finished it there.

1164
01:11:04,193 --> 01:11:05,695
We aren't supposed to get old.

1165
01:11:06,763 --> 01:11:07,897
Kill them all Andre.

1166
01:11:07,897 --> 01:11:09,966
Until next time, Milo.

1167
01:11:11,535 --> 01:11:14,704
(contemplative music)

1168
01:11:25,248 --> 01:11:26,750
- I got a great story.

1169
01:11:26,750 --> 01:11:28,552
- Andre come on, listen
 to this story, come here.

1170
01:11:28,552 --> 01:11:30,019
- [Junior] We can't forget
 about good old Andre.

1171
01:11:30,019 --> 01:11:32,121
- Come on Andre over here,
 come here, come here.

1172
01:11:32,121 --> 01:11:34,358
(muted club music)

1173
01:11:34,358 --> 01:11:35,592
- You'll like this story.

1174
01:11:37,894 --> 01:11:38,728
Tell him the good one boss.

1175
01:11:38,728 --> 01:11:39,563
- Alright.

1176
01:11:41,230 --> 01:11:44,133
(muted club music)

1177
01:11:45,535 --> 01:11:49,873
I was 11 years old and
 this friend of my father's,

1178
01:11:49,873 --> 01:11:52,409
another potato
 picking Cesar Chavez

1179
01:11:52,409 --> 01:11:55,244
(all laughing)

1180
01:11:55,244 --> 01:11:58,582
he tells me he's got this knife.

1181
01:11:58,582 --> 01:11:59,483
So he pulls it out

1182
01:12:01,117 --> 01:12:03,887
and it's fucking
 beautiful, I mean it's

1183
01:12:03,887 --> 01:12:06,189
got ivory blue handles.

1184
01:12:07,791 --> 01:12:11,395
Gorgeous knife I mean it
 just made your palms sweat.

1185
01:12:12,729 --> 01:12:15,665
So one night I follow him home.

1186
01:12:15,665 --> 01:12:18,001
I go up the stairs and I go.

1187
01:12:20,704 --> 01:12:22,972
(all laughing)

1188
01:12:22,972 --> 01:12:24,007
And all of a sudden this guy,

1189
01:12:24,974 --> 01:12:27,877
he opens up the door and he goes

1190
01:12:27,877 --> 01:12:32,281
(speaking in foreign language)

1191
01:12:32,281 --> 01:12:34,350
(Red laughing)

1192
01:12:34,350 --> 01:12:36,352
Then I whip out my knife

1193
01:12:38,788 --> 01:12:39,856
and I say hey

1194
01:12:41,958 --> 01:12:43,693
you forgot something.

1195
01:12:45,662 --> 01:12:49,232
And I walk up and I
look at him in the eyes

1196
01:12:50,634 --> 01:12:55,338
and I stab him in the
 belly 24 times. (growling)

1197
01:12:58,107 --> 01:12:59,075
- I'm fucking dead.

1198
01:13:04,781 --> 01:13:05,982
- Come here baby get up.

1199
01:13:10,186 --> 01:13:13,089
(muted club music)

1200
01:13:15,391 --> 01:13:16,626
So let me finish.

1201
01:13:16,626 --> 01:13:18,462
So the guy grabs
 me by the throat,

1202
01:13:18,462 --> 01:13:20,497
starts choking the
 shit out of me,

1203
01:13:20,497 --> 01:13:24,868
screaming like some
 crazy nutty local.

1204
01:13:26,803 --> 01:13:28,905
It was like killing a
 fucking raging bull.

1205
01:13:31,074 --> 01:13:36,079
But the best part,
 I got the knife.

1206
01:13:36,813 --> 01:13:39,082
(muted club music)

1207
01:13:42,085 --> 01:13:46,590
If you want something
 you gotta die for it.

1208
01:13:46,590 --> 01:13:47,824
If you're not gonna die for it

1209
01:13:47,824 --> 01:13:50,827
you might as well
 forget all about it.

1210
01:13:50,827 --> 01:13:52,862
Put it right out of your mind.

1211
01:13:52,862 --> 01:13:55,565
(muted club music)

1212
01:13:55,565 --> 01:13:56,733
You ever met Janie?

1213
01:13:56,733 --> 01:13:59,235
I'm sorry I didn't
fucking think about it.

1214
01:13:59,235 --> 01:14:00,203
- He lives in my building.

1215
01:14:00,203 --> 01:14:01,404
- I bet he does.

1216
01:14:01,404 --> 01:14:02,338
The rest of the
 girls I don't know.

1217
01:14:02,338 --> 01:14:03,640
They just got here today.

1218
01:14:03,640 --> 01:14:05,642
You guys sure look
 at each other enough.

1219
01:14:07,343 --> 01:14:08,177
You like that?

1220
01:14:09,378 --> 01:14:10,880
You don't like this,
 you don't like this?

1221
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:13,149
You don't like
 that, you like that?

1222
01:14:13,149 --> 01:14:13,983
I like it too.

1223
01:14:15,351 --> 01:14:18,154
I like the smell of her hair,
 the curve of her thighs.

1224
01:14:18,154 --> 01:14:21,090
Oh yeah yeah come here baby.

1225
01:14:22,526 --> 01:14:24,861
You like that guy?

1226
01:14:25,795 --> 01:14:26,630
- No.

1227
01:14:28,598 --> 01:14:30,600
- Would you kiss that guy?

1228
01:14:33,336 --> 01:14:34,270
- No.

1229
01:14:34,270 --> 01:14:35,004
- Would you fuck that guy?

1230
01:14:36,806 --> 01:14:37,641
- Of course not.

1231
01:14:38,708 --> 01:14:40,109
- You can tell me the truth.

1232
01:14:41,745 --> 01:14:42,579
- No.

1233
01:14:43,680 --> 01:14:45,481
- That's my girl.

1234
01:14:46,650 --> 01:14:48,317
What the fuck are
 you looking at?

1235
01:14:52,889 --> 01:14:54,090
- What?

1236
01:14:54,090 --> 01:14:55,759
- Oh now you're gonna
 give me attitude?

1237
01:14:55,759 --> 01:14:58,094
You cross Junior he's
 gonna fuck you up.

1238
01:14:58,094 --> 01:14:59,563
- I don't need your advice.

1239
01:14:59,563 --> 01:15:01,865
- You can take it, leave
 it, or shove it up your ass.

1240
01:15:01,865 --> 01:15:03,767
But while you're on the
 clock you forget the skirt

1241
01:15:03,767 --> 01:15:06,870
and get your thick head
wrapped around the job.

1242
01:15:06,870 --> 01:15:08,137
And don't go back to her place.

1243
01:15:08,137 --> 01:15:11,040
(muted club music)

1244
01:15:15,745 --> 01:15:18,181
- You still have to complete me.

1245
01:15:18,181 --> 01:15:19,749
Sit down.

1246
01:15:19,749 --> 01:15:22,686
(muted club music)

1247
01:15:23,653 --> 01:15:24,487
Sit down.

1248
01:15:24,487 --> 01:15:25,922
- No.

1249
01:15:25,922 --> 01:15:26,756
- Listen.

1250
01:15:28,825 --> 01:15:29,759
You like this guy?

1251
01:15:29,759 --> 01:15:31,227
What you do, sleep with him?

1252
01:15:33,029 --> 01:15:34,063
Come here.

1253
01:15:34,063 --> 01:15:35,298
What?

1254
01:15:35,298 --> 01:15:36,132
(punch lands)

1255
01:15:36,132 --> 01:15:37,100
- Jesus Christ Junior.

1256
01:15:37,100 --> 01:15:38,301
- [Janie] What the fuck?

1257
01:15:38,301 --> 01:15:39,235

01:15:39,235 --> 01:15:40,670
- You gonna hit me now, come on.

1259
01:15:40,670 --> 01:15:42,138
- [Billy] Hey what's

1261
01:15:43,807 --> 01:15:44,941
Nothing's happening alright.

01:15:44,941 --> 01:15:46,610
- [Billy] You okay?

1263
01:15:46,610 --> 01:15:47,911
- I'm okay.

1264
01:15:47,911 --> 01:15:49,378
- [Billy] Is she alright?

1265
01:15:49,378 --> 01:15:50,313
- [Red] She's alright

1266
01:15:50,313 --> 01:15:51,180
- She don't look alright.

1267
01:15:51,180 --> 01:15:52,616
You sure she's okay?

1268
01:15:52,616 --> 01:15:54,517
- I told you she's alright,

- It's okay, it's

1276
01:16:08,064 --> 01:16:12,435
How many times does a guy

1277
01:16:12,435 --> 01:16:14,470
before he bites me
 in the God damn ass?

01:16:15,672 --> 01:16:18,908
You are gonna wish

1279
01:16:18,908 --> 01:16:20,977
You're a fucking French.

1280

1289
01:16:50,674 --> 01:16:51,607

01:17:44,427 --> 01:17:46,195
- What are you doing,

1300
01:17:46,195 --> 01:17:48,031

(contemplative music)

1314
01:18:11,154 --> 01:18:12,521
What's this look for?

1315
01:18:12,521 --> 01:18:13,757
- Why are you making me do this?

1316
01:18:13,757 --> 01:18:14,958

1317
01:18:14,958 --> 01:18:15,759

This is all business.

1329
01:18:29,138 --> 01:18:30,073
You know it's just business.

1330
01:18:30,073 --> 01:18:31,340
You want to be in the movies?

1331
01:18:31,340 --> 01:18:33,176
You don't want to

Alright?

You guys have a good time.

1337
01:18:46,722 --> 01:18:49,325
(upbeat music)

1338
01:19:02,205 --> 01:19:03,539
- Oh my God Janie.

1339
01:19:04,808 --> 01:19:08,011
What the fuck did

1340
01:19:08,011 --> 01:19:11,314
(upbeat music)

1341
01:19:11,314 --> 01:19:13,249

01:19:14,851 --> 01:19:17,420
(upbeat music)

1344
01:19:36,272 --> 01:19:40,176
- [Emily] Andre it's Emily,
 I've been trying to...

1345
01:19:40,176 --> 01:19:41,845
Andre?

1346
01:19:41,845 --> 01:19:44,447
(upbeat music)

1347
01:19:56,292 --> 01:19:59,462
(contemplative music)

1348
01:20:22,818 --> 01:20:25,889
- I asked you for a
sign I didn't mean this.

1349
01:20:25,889 --> 01:20:29,058
(contemplative music)

1350
01:20:30,493 --> 01:20:33,729
You're such a cruel mean
 son of a bitch sometimes.

1351
01:20:33,729 --> 01:20:36,900
(contemplative music)

1352
01:20:59,055 --> 01:21:01,224
- Hey Andre what are you doing?

1353
01:21:01,224 --> 01:21:03,960
Hey man Junior finds out
 you're here we're both fucked.

1354
01:21:05,661 --> 01:21:07,296
- I want your gun.

1355
01:21:07,296 --> 01:21:08,131
- [Red] What?

1356
01:21:08,131 --> 01:21:09,432
- I want your gun.

1357
01:21:09,432 --> 01:21:10,900
- I can't do that.

1358
01:21:10,900 --> 01:21:13,402
Did you get kicked in the head
 today grasshopper or what?

1359
01:21:14,837 --> 01:21:16,605
Hey look you know we're
buddies now right.

1360
01:21:16,605 --> 01:21:18,407
I owe you a little bit
 but if I give this to you

1361
01:21:18,407 --> 01:21:19,675
knowing where you're
 about to go I mean

1362
01:21:19,675 --> 01:21:21,710
what does that do for
 me really you know?

1363
01:21:23,146 --> 01:21:26,382
- You gonna talk all night or
 you gonna give me that gun?

1364
01:21:26,382 --> 01:21:27,350
- Hey look let me
 tell you something.

1365
01:21:27,350 --> 01:21:28,952
These guys aren't like me right?

1366
01:21:28,952 --> 01:21:31,220
These are homeboys from
Chiapas way down south.

1367
01:21:31,220 --> 01:21:35,558
They'll die before they let
 you even touch him again.

1368
01:21:35,558 --> 01:21:37,793
(contemplative music)

1369
01:21:37,793 --> 01:21:39,328
You know what take the gun man.

01:21:40,296 --> 01:21:41,931

Fucking go on go

01:21:44,033 --> 01:21:45,801
Kill me, do it kill me.

1373
01:21:45,801 --> 01:21:47,070
- You don't want to go there.

1374
01:21:47,070 --> 01:21:49,838
(dramatic music)

1375
01:22:34,917 --> 01:22:39,088
- Let's make a toast to
 the poorly departed Marco

1376
01:22:41,024 --> 01:22:43,492
who lived every day as
though it was his last.

1377
01:22:48,964 --> 01:22:53,669
And to my old man who's
 nothing but a potato picker.

1378
01:22:55,004 --> 01:22:58,674
But he knew without
friends you are nothing,

1379
01:23:00,043 --> 01:23:02,511
you are nobody, you're dead.

1380
01:23:07,850 --> 01:23:09,218
You're my friend right?

1381
01:23:10,319 --> 01:23:11,687
And you're my friend?

1382
01:23:11,687 --> 01:23:12,921
- Si boss.

1383
01:23:12,921 --> 01:23:14,923
- And you're my friend,
and you're my friend,

1384
01:23:14,923 --> 01:23:16,892
and you're my friend,
 and you're my guy,

1385
01:23:16,892 --> 01:23:18,694
and you're my guy.

1386
01:23:18,694 --> 01:23:21,297
(all shouting)

1387
01:23:22,598 --> 01:23:24,100
(meditative music)

1388
01:23:24,100 --> 01:23:25,101
- How you doing man?

1389
01:23:26,035 --> 01:23:29,038
Everything cool?

1390
01:23:29,038 --> 01:23:31,874
(punches landing)

1391
01:23:33,242 --> 01:23:34,410
Just relax.

1392
01:23:35,278 --> 01:23:38,214
(meditative music)

1393
01:23:43,519 --> 01:23:47,090
(punches landing)

1394
01:23:47,090 --> 01:23:48,591
- Where's fucking Red?

1395
01:23:48,591 --> 01:23:50,093
Where's my friend Red?

1396
01:23:50,093 --> 01:23:51,026
- Want me to call him?

1397
01:23:51,026 --> 01:23:52,895
- Yeah I want to call him.

1398
01:23:52,895 --> 01:23:53,862
Hey man hey listen.

1399
01:23:55,331 --> 01:24:00,303
Send some flowers
 to Janie, got it.

1400
01:24:01,437 --> 01:24:02,105
And girls, girls,
 girls, we need girls.

1401
01:24:02,105 --> 01:24:03,339
You want girls?

1402
01:24:03,339 --> 01:24:04,640
We all want girls.

1403
01:24:04,640 --> 01:24:07,410
(dramatic music)

1404
01:24:12,981 --> 01:24:15,684
- Don't move Andre.

1405
01:24:15,684 --> 01:24:16,519
- Armando.

1406
01:24:17,420 --> 01:24:18,254
- Go.

1407
01:24:19,122 --> 01:24:20,623
- Where's Armando?

1408
01:24:20,623 --> 01:24:23,392
(dramatic music)

1409
01:24:25,761 --> 01:24:27,696
- He brought you a
 little present boss.

1410
01:24:28,564 --> 01:24:32,501
(speaking in foreign language)

1411
01:24:33,869 --> 01:24:34,937
- This is unexpected.

1412
01:24:35,904 --> 01:24:37,273
Would you like some desert?

1413
01:24:39,041 --> 01:24:40,309
Listen if you wanted to talk you

1414
01:24:40,309 --> 01:24:42,111
should have just
 stopped by my club.

1415
01:24:43,279 --> 01:24:45,314
But you're here so
 we can talk now.

1416
01:24:46,882 --> 01:24:48,251
What's the matter Andre?

1417
01:24:49,418 --> 01:24:51,954
She tell you how good
 all our dicks taste?

1418
01:24:51,954 --> 01:24:54,357
(all laughing)

1419
01:24:54,357 --> 01:24:56,024
- [Armando] Answer the man.

1420
01:24:56,024 --> 01:24:57,193
- Take it easy Armando.

1421
01:24:58,827 --> 01:25:00,696
Come on where is
 your sense of humor?

1422
01:25:00,696 --> 01:25:03,766
(dramatic music)

1423
01:25:03,766 --> 01:25:07,002
I like you don't get me wrong.

1424
01:25:07,002 --> 01:25:08,171
You're just like me.

1425
01:25:09,905 --> 01:25:11,440
I could see it in your eyes.

1426
01:25:13,176 --> 01:25:14,009
You're no different.

1427
01:25:14,977 --> 01:25:15,944
Forget about Janie.

1428
01:25:17,213 --> 01:25:19,848
She's nothing but a
 natural born hooker.

1429
01:25:22,418 --> 01:25:25,988
But you got balls
 Andre, you got balls.

1430
01:25:27,055 --> 01:25:28,657
So I tell you what I'm gonna do.

1431
01:25:29,825 --> 01:25:31,527
Since you're already
 on your knees

1432
01:25:33,028 --> 01:25:34,297
if you suck my dick

1433
01:25:37,566 --> 01:25:40,369
real good and add a little twist

1434
01:25:41,570 --> 01:25:42,438
I'll forgive you.

1435
01:25:44,707 --> 01:25:46,909
I might even let you
have your old job back.

1436
01:25:47,876 --> 01:25:49,178
Maybe we could be friends.

1437
01:25:51,614 --> 01:25:53,782
What do you say?

1438
01:25:53,782 --> 01:25:55,518
- [Armando] Answer the man.

1439
01:25:55,518 --> 01:25:59,622
- You probably wouldn't
be any good anyway.

1440
01:25:59,622 --> 01:26:01,056
Go killer.

1441
01:26:01,056 --> 01:26:03,792
(dramatic music)

1442
01:26:04,893 --> 01:26:06,862
(speaking in foreign language)

1443
01:26:06,862 --> 01:26:09,198
(gun fires)

1444
01:26:10,399 --> 01:26:13,502
(machine gun firing)

1445
01:26:27,716 --> 01:26:30,486
(dramatic music)

1446
01:26:34,056 --> 01:26:34,890
- Andre.

1447
01:26:35,758 --> 01:26:37,293
(gun clicks)

1448
01:26:37,293 --> 01:26:40,028
(dramatic music)

1449
01:26:40,896 --> 01:26:43,999
(machine gun firing)

1450
01:26:55,811 --> 01:26:58,080
(grunting)

1451
01:27:06,289 --> 01:27:10,025
(dramatic music ends)

1452
01:27:10,025 --> 01:27:12,428
(calm music)

1453
01:28:04,847 --> 01:28:07,583
(ethereal music)

1454
01:28:12,187 --> 01:28:14,723
- [Young Man] Junior Lopez.

1455
01:28:14,723 --> 01:28:17,493
(ethereal music)

1456
01:28:18,461 --> 01:28:20,796
(laughing)

1457
01:28:21,730 --> 01:28:24,232
(guns firing)

1458
01:28:29,137 --> 01:28:31,907
(ethereal music)

1459
01:28:45,488 --> 01:28:47,723
- Four DOA's, seven
 gun shot wounds,

1460
01:28:47,723 --> 01:28:50,859
fatal and nonfatal,
 multiple domestic beatings.

1461
01:28:50,859 --> 01:28:53,261
A lot of dumb ass
 accidents all in one night.

1462
01:28:53,261 --> 01:28:55,097
I was getting ready to
sign off but it required

1463
01:28:55,097 --> 01:28:57,933
all three of us to
 register them all in.

1464
01:28:57,933 --> 01:28:58,867
- Do I look as
 though I'm interested

1465
01:28:58,867 --> 01:29:00,102
in your life story Doctor?

1466
01:29:00,102 --> 01:29:01,804
- Look Doctor Fisher
 I just four years

1467
01:29:01,804 --> 01:29:04,206
post graduate school, I'm
 a bonafide specialist.

1468
01:29:04,206 --> 01:29:05,674
I can't work like this.

1469
01:29:05,674 --> 01:29:07,443
I'd already worked a 20
 hour day when they arrived.

1470
01:29:07,443 --> 01:29:08,677
That was three in the morning.

1471
01:29:08,677 --> 01:29:11,113
I'm still here, I
don't think it's right.

1472
01:29:11,113 --> 01:29:13,181
- Then tell it to
 someone who gives a damn.

1473
01:29:13,181 --> 01:29:16,351
(contemplative music)

1474
01:29:32,200 --> 01:29:34,970
I do hope you have good
 health coverage Mr. Siegel.

1475
01:29:36,472 --> 01:29:37,973
(contemplative music)

1476
01:29:37,973 --> 01:29:38,774
- Yeah.

1477
01:29:40,743 --> 01:29:43,011
I gotta start taking it easy.

1478
01:29:43,011 --> 01:29:46,181
(contemplative music)

1479
01:30:40,302 --> 01:30:42,871
(upbeat music)
