1
00:01:02,686 --> 00:01:03,486
C'mon.

2
00:01:26,755 --> 00:01:29,983
Hey, Beckett. Why don't
I get to carry the rifle?

3
00:01:30,004 --> 00:01:31,875
'Cause you're too young.

4
00:01:49,832 --> 00:01:50,999
Try to keep up!

5
00:01:58,224 --> 00:01:59,457
Rowan!

6
00:02:03,686 --> 00:02:04,986
Rowan!

7
00:02:06,557 --> 00:02:07,857
Rowan!

8
00:02:07,858 --> 00:02:08,758
Run!

9
00:02:08,778 --> 00:02:10,978
Get away from my brother!

10
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,833
OK. I'll be right back.

11
00:03:36,188 --> 00:03:36,988
Hey.

12
00:03:46,068 --> 00:03:48,268
Thanks for coming.

13
00:03:51,067 --> 00:03:53,767
- How are you?
- Oh... you know.

14
00:03:53,787 --> 00:03:55,387
Right.

15
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:16,297
- What's all this?
- Yeah, that's new for you, isn't it?

16
00:04:16,317 --> 00:04:18,617
Loggin's taken over the whole area.

17
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:40,025
I packed what I could.

18
00:04:40,045 --> 00:04:42,645
- There's a map and the trail is marked.
- Good.

19
00:04:43,065 --> 00:04:45,565
OK. Listen, I'm gonna set out tomorrow.

20
00:04:45,585 --> 00:04:47,585
I'll be gone three days, tops.

21
00:04:47,605 --> 00:04:49,605
Sit tight. Don't talk to anybody.

22
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:53,725
I'm so sorry, but, you're the
only person he trusts.

23
00:04:53,745 --> 00:04:55,345
You did the right thing.

24
00:04:57,082 --> 00:04:59,282
We'll find Johnny. Don't you worry.

25
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:02,630
I should get going.

26
00:05:04,525 --> 00:05:05,325
Rowan?

27
00:05:06,338 --> 00:05:07,571
Be careful.

28
00:06:12,952 --> 00:06:14,585
You're taking too many.

29
00:06:14,605 --> 00:06:16,305
It's not right.

30
00:06:16,325 --> 00:06:19,025
The mother's with cubs. It's off limits.

31
00:06:21,393 --> 00:06:22,993
It's gettin' late.

32
00:06:39,581 --> 00:06:41,248
I think we got a problem.

33
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:44,168
Johnny Cadillac's not too happy.

34
00:06:55,897 --> 00:06:57,864
We're headin' back, tomorrow.

35
00:06:57,876 --> 00:06:58,809
No, we're not.

36
00:06:58,829 --> 00:07:02,429
- Well, you've taken enough, already.
- Sheriff gave us a week, to hunt.

37
00:07:02,449 --> 00:07:05,749
And you don't get paid until we're done.
You got that?

38
00:07:06,269 --> 00:07:08,269
I don't want your money.

39
00:07:18,648 --> 00:07:22,481
- This is gonna complicate things.
- I know pretty, when I see it.

40
00:07:22,501 --> 00:07:25,701
You stay here. I'll clean this shit up.

41
00:07:48,495 --> 00:07:49,395
Pike?

42
00:07:50,084 --> 00:07:51,117
What the...

43
00:08:34,787 --> 00:08:36,187
Well, hello!

44
00:08:37,316 --> 00:08:38,116
Hi.

45
00:08:38,136 --> 00:08:40,536
You gonna let a woman dance by herself?

46
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:44,243
No, we can't have that.

47
00:09:17,073 --> 00:09:21,006
- Hey! Gently!
- I haven't... I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

48
00:09:21,626 --> 00:09:23,626
Here we go. Here we go.

49
00:09:24,599 --> 00:09:27,566
Haven't been with a girl in a while, have you?

50
00:09:27,855 --> 00:09:29,488
You don't know the half of it.

51
00:09:38,693 --> 00:09:42,026
- I am gonna take care of you.
- C'mere, c'mere, c'mere.

52
00:09:42,046 --> 00:09:44,546
No. First you gotta take care of me.

53
00:09:44,566 --> 00:09:46,566
Guess you wanna be on the bed for that?

54
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:51,486
- No. No, I was talking about money, dummy.
- The money?

55
00:09:52,106 --> 00:09:53,806
Yeah.

56
00:09:55,543 --> 00:09:56,543
Jesus.

57
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:58,663
Listen, I, uh...

58
00:09:59,356 --> 00:10:01,389
OK, wait, wait. I didn't know this was...

59
00:10:01,409 --> 00:10:04,009
You know... no, no, no, no, no.

60
00:10:04,029 --> 00:10:06,029
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

61
00:10:06,049 --> 00:10:08,049
Hold up. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

62
00:10:08,869 --> 00:10:10,769
- You have to go.
- What?

63
00:10:10,789 --> 00:10:12,389
You gotta go.

64
00:10:12,509 --> 00:10:16,185
Well, it doesn't really work like that.
I mean, you brought me here so...

65
00:10:16,206 --> 00:10:18,929
use me, or not, but you gotta pay.

66
00:10:18,949 --> 00:10:21,749
What'd you think? That this was
your lucky night, or some shit?

67
00:10:22,185 --> 00:10:26,118
- Come on, let's just...
- Just give me something, I...

68
00:10:26,174 --> 00:10:28,307
I can't go back like this.

69
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,013
Come on.

70
00:10:33,189 --> 00:10:34,556
You gotta leave.

71
00:10:34,576 --> 00:10:36,176
Fuck you!

72
00:10:43,984 --> 00:10:48,517
<i>What the fuck did I tell you! Get the
fuckin' money first! Huh? Did I tell ya?</i>

73
00:10:48,537 --> 00:10:51,637
<i>Huh? What am I supposed to do, huh?
I always say get the fuckin' money.</i>

74
00:10:51,657 --> 00:10:55,157
<i>Huh? What? What? What?</i>

75
00:10:58,472 --> 00:11:00,672
Right? Right? Don't I always
fuckin' tellin' you that?

76
00:11:00,692 --> 00:11:02,692
Huh? Don't I?!

77
00:11:07,932 --> 00:11:10,665
This piece of shit here, huh? Yeah? Yeah.

78
00:11:24,838 --> 00:11:28,638
Hey, hey. Hey! Hey, hands where I can see 'em.

79
00:11:28,658 --> 00:11:30,658
Come on. Hey! Dammit! Get your hands up.

80
00:11:32,878 --> 00:11:35,878
Hey, wider. Ha-ha.

81
00:11:41,274 --> 00:11:44,174
Son of a bitch. Come here.

82
00:11:44,194 --> 00:11:46,794
Get up. Get up, you little shit.

83
00:11:47,145 --> 00:11:48,478
How'd you like that?

84
00:11:48,498 --> 00:11:50,698
- Fuck you!
- Shut up. Hands on your head.

85
00:11:50,718 --> 00:11:52,018
Get your head down.

86
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:56,993
Beckett!

87
00:11:57,514 --> 00:12:00,214
- What's goin' on?
- Rowan's back.

88
00:12:00,234 --> 00:12:03,634
- Your Rowan? What's he doin' here?
- Hell if I know.

89
00:12:03,654 --> 00:12:05,954
- Please, give us a second.
- Hey.

90
00:12:06,274 --> 00:12:09,774
- Well, he got you pretty good, huh?
- That fuckin' psycho attacked me.

91
00:12:09,794 --> 00:12:11,794
Lemme see. Huh, yeah...

92
00:12:13,262 --> 00:12:14,529
- Whoa, whoa, whoa...
- Fuckin' asshole!

93
00:12:14,548 --> 00:12:16,548
- Slow it down.
- God!

94
00:12:16,568 --> 00:12:19,968
This is a small... quiet town, Franco.

95
00:12:20,421 --> 00:12:25,254
Sully, here, is near retired. He doesn't
need trouble from a guy like you, so...

96
00:12:25,274 --> 00:12:29,074
I see you here again, you're gonna
get a lot more than a broken nose.

97
00:12:29,094 --> 00:12:31,094
Go on. Get outta here.

98
00:12:31,114 --> 00:12:32,714
What about her?

99
00:12:32,734 --> 00:12:36,234
I'll drive her home. You deal with your brother.

100
00:12:37,635 --> 00:12:38,502
Yeah...

101
00:12:47,805 --> 00:12:50,605
- What you doin' here?
- I grew up here, remember?

102
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:53,625
- I remember. When'd you get out?
- What do you care?

103
00:12:56,786 --> 00:12:57,886
Seven years.

104
00:12:59,732 --> 00:13:02,599
Seven years, you come back here,
like some random act of violence.

105
00:13:02,619 --> 00:13:05,119
- You point a fuckin' gun at me?
- Police procedure, pal.

106
00:13:05,139 --> 00:13:07,739
- Fine. OK.
- No family discounts.

107
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:10,059
Hey, you sure you got the
right guy, lawman? Really?

108
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:14,679
No. When you left, I was worried sick about you.

109
00:13:14,699 --> 00:13:17,799
Then I heard what you did. That you shot a man.

110
00:13:18,319 --> 00:13:25,419
Then I said... No... no, that's not my brother.

111
00:13:27,171 --> 00:13:28,838
You know, dad...

112
00:13:29,158 --> 00:13:31,958
never mentioned your name, again.

113
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:35,278
Mom, she, uh... she mourned
you, like you were dead.

114
00:13:36,298 --> 00:13:40,498
You know, I thought you'da learned by now, that
there's consequences to your actions, but...

115
00:13:41,918 --> 00:13:43,918
maybe you need another lesson.

116
00:13:46,438 --> 00:13:49,338
Boy, that's some boyfriend you got there, lady.

117
00:14:03,965 --> 00:14:05,632
Welcome home.

118
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:25,866
You changed the place.

119
00:14:26,389 --> 00:14:27,389
Yeah.

120
00:14:29,548 --> 00:14:30,548
Yeah.

121
00:14:31,368 --> 00:14:33,368
There's a new boss of the house.

122
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:36,365
Where's she?

123
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:40,152
She's out in the bush.

124
00:14:52,569 --> 00:14:55,769
- Michelle needed a workspace, so...
- Yeah.

125
00:14:59,181 --> 00:15:03,048
She was a photojournalist, from
the east coast. She, uh...

126
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:07,368
fell in love with the wildlife,
became a biologist, a researcher...

127
00:15:07,388 --> 00:15:11,388
- Now, she's out on the trail, almost every day.
- This her, here?

128
00:15:11,408 --> 00:15:12,608
Yeah.

129
00:15:12,628 --> 00:15:14,628
Conservationist, huh?

130
00:15:14,648 --> 00:15:16,648
How'd you get her to marry you?

131
00:15:17,468 --> 00:15:19,668
I put away my hunting rifle.

132
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:25,510
- For good?
- Yep.

133
00:15:27,808 --> 00:15:31,008
- What's this?
- Radio frequency identifications..

134
00:15:31,028 --> 00:15:34,528
We've collared about 200 animals,
in the past couple years.

135
00:15:34,548 --> 00:15:36,948
Had to wear one of these on my ankle, for a year.

136
00:15:38,568 --> 00:15:40,568
Why are you here, Rowan?

137
00:15:42,754 --> 00:15:46,887
I was gonna go out to the Grizzly Maze and pay
respect to dad, where it really meant something.

138
00:15:46,907 --> 00:15:49,907
Couple of nights, come back, disappear,
and you wouldn't even know I was here.

139
00:15:49,927 --> 00:15:51,927
I'm not here to mess with your life.

140
00:15:53,056 --> 00:15:57,256
- Why don't you pay your respects to both of them?
- Well, yeah. That was the plan. I was gonna...

141
00:15:58,476 --> 00:15:59,676
Yeah.

142
00:16:00,296 --> 00:16:05,096
Well, you can sleep in my old room... if you want.

143
00:16:05,116 --> 00:16:07,116
Think I'll take the couch.

144
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:47,210
Keep your eyes out.

145
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,500
Hey!

146
00:16:56,587 --> 00:17:00,787
- So, what do we got?
- Right there, just like I said.

147
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:01,460
Marcus!

148
00:18:05,062 --> 00:18:05,895
Marcus!?

149
00:18:10,207 --> 00:18:11,074
Marcus!

150
00:19:20,634 --> 00:19:22,967
Don't even think about it.

151
00:19:26,277 --> 00:19:27,710
Hey, listen...

152
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:29,430
My parole is done.

153
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:31,950
I'm a free man, so...

154
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:34,370
technically, half of all this, is mine.

155
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:36,909
Well... well, I don't mean
to burst your bubble, Rowan,

156
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:39,710
but I don't think you made it into the will.

157
00:19:41,576 --> 00:19:43,709
Don't worry, I'll be gone, soon.

158
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:46,930
Hey, uh...

159
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:50,116
I was gonna go join Michelle, a
little later, out at dad's flats, and

160
00:19:50,137 --> 00:19:53,570
check on some snares and,
if you wanna wait for me...

161
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:55,990
Yeah, thanks, but, uh... I
gotta do this one alone.

162
00:19:56,610 --> 00:19:58,410
Yeah. Great.

163
00:20:09,073 --> 00:20:10,940
Hey, uh...

164
00:20:14,422 --> 00:20:16,722
Now that you're a free man.

165
00:20:23,415 --> 00:20:24,615
Yeah.

166
00:20:33,415 --> 00:20:35,148
It was like a lifetime ago.

167
00:20:38,566 --> 00:20:39,766
Yeah.

168
00:20:39,786 --> 00:20:42,786
Well, I gotta get to work, so,
I'll meet you upstairs, uh...

169
00:20:43,774 --> 00:20:44,907
Alright.

170
00:20:50,794 --> 00:20:53,527
<i>Beckett. Come in, Beckett.</i>

171
00:20:58,788 --> 00:21:00,388
<i>Beckett, you there?</i>

172
00:21:01,408 --> 00:21:03,008
<i>Come in, Beckett.</i>

173
00:21:05,797 --> 00:21:07,097
Yeah, go ahead.

174
00:21:07,117 --> 00:21:10,417
<i>Somethin's gone down at Gordon's clearcut.
Meet me there.</i>

175
00:21:10,437 --> 00:21:12,437
Yeah, I'll be there in a minute.

176
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,060
Come on, we gotta go.

177
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:26,380
It's OK. Why don't you go serve and protect?

178
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:29,400
Somethin' up at the clearcut.
I'll give you a ride.

179
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:31,220
It's on my way.

180
00:21:36,577 --> 00:21:38,910
Sheriff, it's a real mess up there.

181
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:42,686
But I got a lotta family men on
payroll, so I wanna make sure that

182
00:21:42,707 --> 00:21:46,350
whoever, whatever did this, is
stopped, sooner rather than later.

183
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:49,070
- We'll take care of it.
- Get this cleaned up.

184
00:22:13,677 --> 00:22:15,944
Bear spray and a tranquilizer gun?

185
00:22:15,964 --> 00:22:19,964
Yeah, I thought about usin' it on the bastards
that've been huntin' around here without a permit.

186
00:22:19,984 --> 00:22:21,984
Jesus! Who the hell are you?

187
00:22:22,004 --> 00:22:26,604
I don't know. Talkin' about
makin' the maze a protected zone.

188
00:22:26,624 --> 00:22:28,624
Dad would've appreciated that.

189
00:22:28,644 --> 00:22:34,544
Yeah. You know, we'll be campin' out there
in dad's flats, if you change your mind.

190
00:22:36,139 --> 00:22:40,872
I'll probably be in the maze, by then, so...
but... thanks.

191
00:22:44,869 --> 00:22:46,536
What're you up to, Rowan?

192
00:22:48,156 --> 00:22:53,456
I was gonna wait for you to leave and... go rob a
bank, you know, score a fix. The usual, you know.

193
00:22:53,476 --> 00:22:57,176
- I know you. Somethin's up.
- You don't know me.

194
00:24:19,616 --> 00:24:21,683
We got a real mess.

195
00:24:21,703 --> 00:24:25,703
- Couple bootleg cutters, or what's left of 'em...
- Yeah?

196
00:24:25,723 --> 00:24:28,523
- Blood everywhere, no bodies.
- Jesus.

197
00:24:28,543 --> 00:24:31,243
- Yeah.
- Last night or this morning?

198
00:24:31,263 --> 00:24:34,263
I don't know. We'll get up there.
See what's going on.

199
00:24:34,283 --> 00:24:35,683
Hey, Kaley.

200
00:24:35,703 --> 00:24:37,103
- Hey.
- Hey.

201
00:24:37,123 --> 00:24:40,323
Coroner's on his way. He wanted me to
come up and start collecting the remains.

202
00:24:40,343 --> 00:24:43,943
Kaley... what we gonna do without you?

203
00:24:43,963 --> 00:24:45,963
I guess he'll have to get his hands dirty.

204
00:24:45,983 --> 00:24:48,383
Oh, yeah. They had a dog, too.

205
00:24:59,467 --> 00:25:01,534
- Hi, folks.
- What's goin' on?

206
00:25:01,554 --> 00:25:03,954
- Well, the guns weren't fired.
- Uh-huh.

207
00:25:03,974 --> 00:25:07,776
One of the saws is still in the
tree, hand clutching the trigger.

208
00:25:07,797 --> 00:25:10,270
Some body parts scattered,
but most of it's gone.

209
00:25:10,291 --> 00:25:11,514
Uh-huh.

210
00:25:11,534 --> 00:25:14,734
- Yeah, it's a bear.
- You're goddam right, it's a bear.

211
00:25:15,954 --> 00:25:17,654
It's a nasty one, too.

212
00:25:18,474 --> 00:25:22,674
What the hell kind of animal would come
around a man with a runnin' chainsaw?

213
00:25:23,094 --> 00:25:25,094
I ain't ever seen that before.

214
00:25:25,914 --> 00:25:29,614
- Well, he's certainly hungry.
- No. Desperate's more like it, uh...

215
00:25:29,634 --> 00:25:32,034
it's when they get dangerous,
when they're desperate.

216
00:25:32,054 --> 00:25:34,754
Douglas, what're you doin' here, huh?

217
00:25:35,174 --> 00:25:38,274
It's a crime scene. Go on.

218
00:25:38,294 --> 00:25:42,594
I was huntin' bears when you were still
playin' with tiddly winks, asshole.

219
00:25:42,614 --> 00:25:46,714
Back to business, I wouldn't be a bit surprised
this wasn't one of your pets that done it.

220
00:25:46,734 --> 00:25:48,334
You got a bear around here?

221
00:25:48,354 --> 00:25:50,854
No, I don't have a bear around here.
It's not one of my collars.

222
00:25:50,874 --> 00:25:53,374
What're you. some kind of psychic?

223
00:25:53,994 --> 00:25:55,794
Let's check the signals.

224
00:25:57,014 --> 00:25:58,014
Beckett.

225
00:25:58,434 --> 00:26:01,634
- Check the fuckin' signals.
- Yeah, I'll check. I'll check 'em.

226
00:26:01,654 --> 00:26:03,954
- Alright, that's our current position, right now.
- Mmm-hmm.

227
00:26:03,974 --> 00:26:06,674
- And... yeah, there's one bear.
- Mmm-hmm.

228
00:26:06,694 --> 00:26:09,394
Sheriff, it looks like you
want me to go huntin' now, huh?

229
00:26:09,414 --> 00:26:10,814
You got the money, I got the time.

230
00:26:10,834 --> 00:26:13,734
Hey, hey, hey. You can't
shoot a collared bear, pal.

231
00:26:13,754 --> 00:26:16,154
OK? You understand? That's the law. Alright?

232
00:26:16,174 --> 00:26:17,974
- Not without proof, understand?
- Back up. Back up, there.

233
00:26:17,994 --> 00:26:19,294
- Hey, hey, hey.
- You understand the law?

234
00:26:19,314 --> 00:26:21,014
- What?
- You're wife's out there.

235
00:26:21,034 --> 00:26:23,834
You brother. You're worried about a fuckin' bear?

236
00:26:23,854 --> 00:26:26,054
Somebody's gonna go after this thing.

237
00:26:26,074 --> 00:26:27,874
He's the best tracker I know.

238
00:26:27,894 --> 00:26:30,794
He's a butcher, OK? That's all he is.

239
00:26:30,814 --> 00:26:35,114
I'm gonna go out there myself. I'll get Michelle
out and I'll capture the damn bear, OK?

240
00:26:35,134 --> 00:26:38,834
You wanna use this guy so bad, have him
set up traps around here, in this area.

241
00:26:38,854 --> 00:26:40,754
But he stays the hell away from the forest.

242
00:26:40,774 --> 00:26:43,574
- Alright? I mean it.
- Anything you say, Deputy.

243
00:26:43,594 --> 00:26:48,494
I'm just here to help. But just so you
know, this ain't your average bear.

244
00:26:48,514 --> 00:26:50,114
This is a clever one.

245
00:26:50,173 --> 00:26:53,493
I mean, how you think somethin'
that big can hide that good and

246
00:26:53,514 --> 00:26:57,093
surprise two men in a clearing before
they can get even one shot off?

247
00:26:57,513 --> 00:26:59,913
It's a smart fucker, that's how.

248
00:26:59,933 --> 00:27:02,433
You never met a bear like this, before, Beckett.

249
00:27:02,453 --> 00:27:04,153
And if you did, you wouldn't
know what to do with it.

250
00:27:04,173 --> 00:27:06,073
- Alright, are you done?
- Yeah, I'm done.

251
00:27:06,093 --> 00:27:06,993
OK.

252
00:27:07,013 --> 00:27:09,913
- I'm just tellin' ya.
- And I'm hearin' ya.

253
00:27:11,233 --> 00:27:15,233
Sully, call me after you find the
next body, 'cause you will find it.

254
00:27:15,253 --> 00:27:16,453
Beckett!

255
00:27:18,624 --> 00:27:24,757
When you're out there... and you see that, listen
to me... and you see that bear, you kill it.

256
00:27:24,777 --> 00:27:27,877
Now go up there, find your wife
and get her the hell outta there.

257
00:27:27,897 --> 00:27:30,097
I'll close down the trails. Go on.

258
00:27:32,502 --> 00:27:33,569
Hey, Beckett.

259
00:27:34,189 --> 00:27:35,789
I'm comin' with you.

260
00:27:35,809 --> 00:27:40,009
Gerry, find out how many people we got out
there and find a way to get 'em back.

261
00:27:40,029 --> 00:27:43,929
Zoe, put out signs. Close all the trails.
Close 'em all.

262
00:27:43,949 --> 00:27:45,349
- You got it, boss.
 - Alright.

263
00:28:59,783 --> 00:29:00,616
Sheriff?

264
00:29:01,436 --> 00:29:04,036
- You gotta shut down for a couple days.
- What?

265
00:29:04,056 --> 00:29:05,356
There's nothin' else we can do.

266
00:29:06,662 --> 00:29:08,695
Do you know how much money that is?

267
00:29:08,715 --> 00:29:11,415
Can't you call someone to help
bring in the cavalry or somethin'?

268
00:29:11,435 --> 00:29:16,835
Mr. Jordan, you've gotta understand. Those
loggers were killed by a rogue bear.

269
00:29:16,855 --> 00:29:20,255
But out there, is the Grizzly Maze.

270
00:29:20,275 --> 00:29:24,375
That's some of the roughest, most
dangerous terrain in Alaska.

271
00:29:24,395 --> 00:29:27,495
I don't care how good a hunter
you are, or how experienced...

272
00:29:27,515 --> 00:29:31,093
You go in there without a local guide,
without somebody who grew up here,

273
00:29:31,114 --> 00:29:34,635
somebody who really knows the
trails, you're gonna die.

274
00:29:34,655 --> 00:29:37,455
- Ah!
 - You gotta trust the locals on this.

275
00:29:37,975 --> 00:29:40,675
Beckett's been out there since he was a kid.

276
00:29:40,695 --> 00:29:45,095
- He'll find that bear.
- Yeah, b... must be somebody to help him.

277
00:29:54,086 --> 00:29:58,186
Here. You mind... carryin' this for me?

278
00:29:58,506 --> 00:30:02,006
- It's a tranquilizer gun.
- You really wanna capture this bear?

279
00:30:02,026 --> 00:30:04,026
Well, I... prefer to save it.

280
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:07,587
Just in case.

281
00:30:08,607 --> 00:30:10,007
Watch it.

282
00:30:15,101 --> 00:30:16,334
C'mon, Kaley.

283
00:30:19,850 --> 00:30:23,150
Michelle can't be too far ahead,
if she left this morning.

284
00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:25,370
We gotta catch her before she heads off trail.

285
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:27,190
Why would she do that?

286
00:30:27,210 --> 00:30:31,910
Snares. She likes to set 'em when,
when she finds a bear trail.

287
00:30:36,243 --> 00:30:38,176
Look, why don't you head back?

288
00:30:38,196 --> 00:30:39,096
OK?

289
00:30:39,716 --> 00:30:42,716
Look, I wanna help, I'm not
gonna slow you down, OK?

290
00:30:43,136 --> 00:30:45,936
Rowan's out here fast. You know that.

291
00:30:45,956 --> 00:30:48,256
- And why is he here?
- Hell if I know.

292
00:32:25,699 --> 00:32:26,666
You OK?

293
00:32:28,271 --> 00:32:30,404
Oh, boy. We need to get outta here.

294
00:32:31,735 --> 00:32:32,801
Gimme your hand.

295
00:32:35,683 --> 00:32:36,750
You're Michelle.

296
00:32:37,370 --> 00:32:39,370
I'm-I'm Rowan. I'm Beckett's brother.

297
00:32:42,796 --> 00:32:45,729
Holy shit! You're deaf! We
gotta get you outta here.

298
00:32:45,749 --> 00:32:47,149
Lemme get, here...

299
00:32:47,169 --> 00:32:48,469
Alright, alright, alright, alright. Here.

300
00:32:48,489 --> 00:32:51,989
Do you have... Listen, do
you have a first-aid kit?

301
00:32:52,009 --> 00:32:53,609
First-aid? A bandage?

302
00:32:58,893 --> 00:33:00,293
I'm deaf, not stupid.

303
00:33:01,313 --> 00:33:03,713
Fair enough. You read lips?

304
00:33:03,933 --> 00:33:05,133
Where is it, then?

305
00:33:05,553 --> 00:33:07,653
Over here? OK.

306
00:33:24,798 --> 00:33:26,865
- You ready? Come on.
- Yeah.

307
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,720
Sheriff's department.

308
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:04,940
Douglas, you in there?

309
00:34:06,793 --> 00:34:09,693
Yo, Douglas! It's Sully. You here?

310
00:34:25,196 --> 00:34:26,329
Douglas?

311
00:34:58,635 --> 00:35:01,435
Sully, you nearly got your head blown off.

312
00:35:01,455 --> 00:35:06,255
Listen, Douglas, if you're still up
for it I want ya to kill this bear.

313
00:35:08,175 --> 00:35:10,442
Thought Beckett was gonna adopt it, or somethin'.

314
00:35:10,462 --> 00:35:14,062
He's lookin' for his wife. I need a hunter.

315
00:35:14,282 --> 00:35:16,282
So, that's why you're comin' to me, now?

316
00:35:17,087 --> 00:35:18,487
Sure. Why else?

317
00:35:19,327 --> 00:35:22,587
I dunno, maybe you're worried that
people might think it's your fault

318
00:35:22,608 --> 00:35:25,681
for lettin' assholes like Johnny
Cadillac take poachers out there?

319
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:28,826
I mean, I'm not judgin' ya, Sully.
I can't even say I blame ya.

320
00:35:28,847 --> 00:35:31,920
I mean, a man's gotta do what he's
gotta do to survive. But, uh...

321
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:35,740
With all the loggers and poachers,
out there, it upsets the balance.

322
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:41,260
See, this bear, it... it's not
just territorial, or hungry...

323
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:43,080
What is it?

324
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:45,500
It's pissed off.

325
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:48,620
Just a case of mother nature fightin' back.

326
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,940
You're welcome to stay,
Sully, but I got shit to do.

327
00:35:56,247 --> 00:36:00,480
I just need you to kill this fuckin' bear.
The sooner, the better.

328
00:36:01,567 --> 00:36:04,267
Sully, I've been waitin' on
this bear my whole life.

329
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:06,287
I'm just surprised it took this long.

330
00:36:07,107 --> 00:36:08,707
<i>Hey, Sheriff, come in?</i>

331
00:36:09,888 --> 00:36:11,055
Yeah, Zoe.

332
00:36:11,075 --> 00:36:15,649
I, uh... just posted a sign at Skyline.
I found something, here.

333
00:36:15,669 --> 00:36:17,794
I think you guys should come take a look.

334
00:36:17,814 --> 00:36:20,814
- <i>What is it?</i>
- It's Johnny Cadillac's car.

335
00:36:21,534 --> 00:36:23,434
Any sign of him?

336
00:36:24,254 --> 00:36:26,254
Huh-uh. It's been here awhile.

337
00:36:27,874 --> 00:36:28,674
Sheriff?

338
00:36:30,294 --> 00:36:31,194
Zoe?

339
00:36:36,031 --> 00:36:37,198
Zoe! Come in!

340
00:36:42,749 --> 00:36:43,649
Zoe!

341
00:36:51,887 --> 00:36:54,620
- I'll call ya when it's done.
- Let's go.

342
00:37:00,263 --> 00:37:01,596
<i>Beckett, come in!</i>

343
00:37:03,293 --> 00:37:04,593
<i>Beckett, come in!</i>

344
00:37:06,213 --> 00:37:07,813
Hey, go, Sully.

345
00:37:07,833 --> 00:37:09,433
- You find Michelle?
- <i>No.</i>

346
00:37:09,453 --> 00:37:10,853
No, not yet.

347
00:37:10,873 --> 00:37:12,873
I sent Douglas after the bear.

348
00:37:12,893 --> 00:37:16,493
- Ah, Christ, Sully, why the hell...
- <i>There's been another attack.</i>

349
00:37:17,513 --> 00:37:20,613
Zoe. I think she's gone.

350
00:37:24,541 --> 00:37:26,741
- Where?
 - <i>Skyline Trailhead.</i>

351
00:37:26,761 --> 00:37:28,961
<i>Found a car. Johnny Cadillac's.</i>

352
00:37:28,981 --> 00:37:30,981
This bear's near ya, son.

353
00:37:31,001 --> 00:37:33,801
Find your wife. Get the hell outta there.

354
00:37:33,821 --> 00:37:35,121
Yeah.

355
00:37:35,541 --> 00:37:37,541
Copy that. OK, thanks.

356
00:37:39,681 --> 00:37:41,848
- You ever use one of these?
- Yeah.

357
00:37:42,168 --> 00:37:46,168
Thumb down, safety off. Alright?

358
00:37:46,588 --> 00:37:48,688
Won't stop a bear, but...

359
00:37:50,196 --> 00:37:51,396
might scare it.

360
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:53,510
Maybe.

361
00:38:08,706 --> 00:38:09,572
You OK?

362
00:38:11,948 --> 00:38:12,748
OK.

363
00:38:13,268 --> 00:38:15,768
I'm gonna pitch the tent, make a fire.

364
00:38:15,988 --> 00:38:16,988
Alright?

365
00:38:17,508 --> 00:38:18,508
OK.

366
00:38:19,328 --> 00:38:20,928
Here we go.

367
00:38:24,077 --> 00:38:25,610
Oh, shit, Zoe.

368
00:38:34,209 --> 00:38:35,276
Stay cool.

369
00:38:36,096 --> 00:38:38,096
One step at a time.

370
00:38:38,116 --> 00:38:40,816
Whaddaya think happened to
Johnny and those poachers?

371
00:38:40,836 --> 00:38:42,536
I figure they're gone, too.

372
00:38:42,556 --> 00:38:44,056
You don't know that.

373
00:38:44,076 --> 00:38:49,076
It's been twelve days. Twelve days,
Gerry, and they're not back yet.

374
00:38:51,653 --> 00:38:54,853
Sully, maybe you need to come clean on this.

375
00:38:54,873 --> 00:38:57,673
Zoe's dead. What else you gonna do?

376
00:38:58,493 --> 00:39:02,093
Give Beckett some help. Worry
about the rest, later.

377
00:39:15,732 --> 00:39:16,799
Holy shit.

378
00:39:24,734 --> 00:39:26,534
She used her bear spray.

379
00:39:26,554 --> 00:39:28,554
What the hell happened here?

380
00:39:30,993 --> 00:39:33,026
I'm deaf, not stupid.

381
00:39:33,746 --> 00:39:35,746
I think she met Rowan.

382
00:39:35,766 --> 00:39:39,866
<i>Douglas and Beckett's dad were the
same kind of hunters, old school.</i>

383
00:39:39,886 --> 00:39:42,986
- Lived on what they got.
- Thought they were guides.

384
00:39:43,006 --> 00:39:48,606
Yeah, to pay the rent, now and then, but they'd
never take hunters into the Grizzly Maze.

385
00:39:48,626 --> 00:39:51,326
Never. Place was sacred to 'em.

386
00:39:51,346 --> 00:39:56,246
Then, one night... Douglas was
out with four Canadians...

387
00:39:56,266 --> 00:39:59,166
Bear got into their camp.

388
00:39:59,186 --> 00:40:02,760
Attacked Douglas, in his
sleep and Douglas managed to

389
00:40:02,981 --> 00:40:06,806
get his knife out and stab
the bear, under the chin.

390
00:40:06,826 --> 00:40:09,326
Right in the jugular. Saved his ass.

391
00:40:09,946 --> 00:40:12,846
- Jesus! That's impressive!
- Yeah.

392
00:40:13,466 --> 00:40:15,466
But he snapped...

393
00:40:16,686 --> 00:40:20,186
Week after he got out of the
hospital, he went back out there.

394
00:40:20,206 --> 00:40:23,506
Inside a few days, killed over 20 bears,

395
00:40:23,526 --> 00:40:25,526
left 'em all to rot on the ground.

396
00:40:25,546 --> 00:40:29,246
Then he started takin' hunters
into the maze, makin' money.

397
00:40:29,866 --> 00:40:33,366
Beckett's dad never talked to him, after that.

398
00:40:37,234 --> 00:40:39,234
- Ya alright?
- I got it.

399
00:40:45,649 --> 00:40:46,782
Welcome.

400
00:40:47,202 --> 00:40:49,202
Welcome to dad's flats.

401
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:51,022
Wow.

402
00:40:52,242 --> 00:40:54,242
I've never been over this side of the ridge.

403
00:41:00,309 --> 00:41:01,509
Hey.

404
00:41:09,973 --> 00:41:11,073
Hey!

405
00:41:11,293 --> 00:41:12,393
Hi!

406
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:19,380
Bad girl. What happened to your leg?

407
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,600
Here, let me take a look.

408
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:23,320
Yeah, will ya?

409
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:30,560
Bear. Rowan, O-K.

410
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:32,680
Where is he?

411
00:41:34,507 --> 00:41:36,674
You sure you're OK?

412
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:51,173
Mind moving from there?

413
00:41:52,793 --> 00:41:54,693
Makin' me nervous.

414
00:41:58,487 --> 00:42:01,120
So that's the infamous Grizzly Maze.

415
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:03,140
Yeah, that's what my dad used to call it.

416
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:06,460
'Cause even grizzly's can get lost down there.

417
00:42:09,963 --> 00:42:13,830
- You remember.
- Of course, I do.

418
00:42:16,161 --> 00:42:19,394
Why are you... why are you here?
What are you doin' up here?

419
00:42:19,614 --> 00:42:22,114
- Came with Beckett.
- Oh.

420
00:42:22,134 --> 00:42:24,034
He's down there.

421
00:42:24,054 --> 00:42:25,654
Came to find Michelle.

422
00:43:11,484 --> 00:43:15,351
- Excuse me.
- Hey, what the hell do you think you're doin'?

423
00:43:16,382 --> 00:43:17,315
Leavin'.

424
00:43:17,335 --> 00:43:21,335
No, you're not, alright? No, 'cause I need you
to take the girls back down, tomorrow, OK?

425
00:43:21,355 --> 00:43:25,455
There's a killer bear out here. Three people
are already dead. I need to get after it.

426
00:43:27,241 --> 00:43:29,270
Hey, hey! You hear what I said?
You're not leavin'!

427
00:43:29,291 --> 00:43:30,695
I'm not asking your permission.

428
00:43:30,715 --> 00:43:33,015
- Alright, guys. Just relax.
- Kaley... stay out of it.

429
00:43:33,035 --> 00:43:36,135
You lied to me. You wanna tell
me about Johnny Cadillac?

430
00:43:36,155 --> 00:43:38,155
- Get out of my way.
- No!

431
00:43:38,175 --> 00:43:41,275
You're gonna tell me what the hell you're
doin' out here, or I'm going to arrest ya.

432
00:43:41,295 --> 00:43:44,695
Ha! You're gonna arrest me?
For carryin' bear insurance.

433
00:43:44,715 --> 00:43:47,715
Nope. For illegal possession of a firearm.

434
00:43:54,927 --> 00:43:56,027
Hey! Hey!

435
00:43:58,524 --> 00:43:59,757
Guys, come on!

436
00:43:59,977 --> 00:44:01,677
Are you done, yet?!

437
00:44:13,643 --> 00:44:15,043
What're you, fucking twelve?

438
00:44:16,544 --> 00:44:17,544
Jesus!

439
00:44:22,180 --> 00:44:25,113
Johnny was supposed to be back five days ago.

440
00:44:25,433 --> 00:44:28,533
Took poachers into the maze, never came back.

441
00:44:28,553 --> 00:44:31,453
Mary called me. Didn't wanna come to you.
Didn't wanna come to Sully.

442
00:44:31,473 --> 00:44:33,173
Thought you'd throw him in jail.

443
00:44:33,193 --> 00:44:34,693
That's what I'm here for.

444
00:44:36,050 --> 00:44:38,783
To help the one guy, who stood up for me.

445
00:44:38,803 --> 00:44:40,803
Thought it'd be a great idea to hide it from me?

446
00:44:41,723 --> 00:44:45,123
Three people dead. Michelle got attacked.

447
00:44:45,143 --> 00:44:49,043
- Yeah, that's right, and I saved her life.
- That's not what I'm talkin' about, dumbass!

448
00:44:49,063 --> 00:44:53,263
I tell you my wife is out here
campin' and you keep quiet?

449
00:44:55,083 --> 00:44:58,583
Johnny Cadillac and a couple of
poachers didn't go down by no bear.

450
00:44:58,603 --> 00:45:02,903
You take the girls home, tomorrow.
If I see your bear, I'll kill it.

451
00:45:02,923 --> 00:45:04,023
Fine.

452
00:45:08,890 --> 00:45:11,590
Come on, at least stay the night.
Go back in the morning.

453
00:45:12,310 --> 00:45:15,010
Grizzly out here might be comin' around.

454
00:45:17,038 --> 00:45:18,138
Please.

455
00:45:51,995 --> 00:45:55,128
All my other collars are... migrating north...

456
00:45:55,148 --> 00:45:57,648
in a pretty big radius.

457
00:46:00,108 --> 00:46:03,908
Michelle says, uh, she thinks
the bear is just scared.

458
00:46:03,928 --> 00:46:08,128
Looks like they're all leavin' the maze, you know?
Like they're runnin' from somethin'.

459
00:46:08,148 --> 00:46:10,848
That's gotta be the same bear
that went after Michelle.

460
00:46:10,868 --> 00:46:13,068
Yeah. Did you get a good look at him?

461
00:46:13,088 --> 00:46:15,888
No, he stayed off in the woods.

462
00:46:15,908 --> 00:46:18,408
It's almost like he knew better
than to give me a clean shot.

463
00:46:18,428 --> 00:46:20,428
That was the biggest bear I've ever seen.

464
00:46:21,848 --> 00:46:25,348
Michelle says that it's... she
never got a chance to thank you.

465
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:29,996
It's OK.

466
00:46:34,601 --> 00:46:38,668
And... I'm-I'm sorry, OK?

467
00:46:40,310 --> 00:46:42,577
I could really use your help on this.

468
00:46:42,597 --> 00:46:46,397
Look, I'm not givin' up on Johnny, so whatever
you need from me, just don't ask me to do that.

469
00:46:46,417 --> 00:46:49,217
And if Douglas is out there, he's
gonna beat us to it, anyway.

470
00:46:49,237 --> 00:46:51,237
That's what I'm afraid of.

471
00:46:51,257 --> 00:46:55,057
Do you wanna kill this bear, or do you wanna
save it? You gotta make up your mind.

472
00:46:55,077 --> 00:46:57,077
I wanna kill the right bear.

473
00:46:57,097 --> 00:46:59,097
Jesus Christ, you gotta be kidding me!

474
00:46:59,117 --> 00:47:00,917
I got a friend out there that needs my help.

475
00:47:00,937 --> 00:47:03,283
And if he gets killed out here,
runnin' around in the woods,

476
00:47:03,304 --> 00:47:05,457
poachin' bears, then he got
what he deserved, didn't he?

477
00:47:05,477 --> 00:47:07,477
You're a righteous prick.

478
00:47:08,836 --> 00:47:10,703
I'll take first watch.

479
00:47:21,919 --> 00:47:23,786
Did a nice job on her ankle.

480
00:47:25,611 --> 00:47:29,578
- Is it bad?
- No. It's OK. She'll walk.

481
00:47:30,173 --> 00:47:32,073
Assuming I can keep it from getting infected.

482
00:47:32,893 --> 00:47:34,893
So, you're a doctor, now... huh?

483
00:47:36,113 --> 00:47:40,213
That's funny, I... always
figured you'd leave this place.

484
00:47:42,166 --> 00:47:43,266
I am.

485
00:47:44,858 --> 00:47:46,125
In two weeks.

486
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:48,844
Toronto.

487
00:47:50,582 --> 00:47:51,649
Really?

488
00:47:53,170 --> 00:47:56,503
Do you know how many times I tried to contact you?

489
00:47:59,825 --> 00:48:01,892
What do you want from me?

490
00:48:02,361 --> 00:48:03,528
I don't know.

491
00:48:04,865 --> 00:48:06,032
Some answers.

492
00:48:08,779 --> 00:48:12,646
Stick to what you believe.
It's as good a story as any.

493
00:48:14,750 --> 00:48:18,683
I once had my whole life planned
out, with you, in my head.

494
00:48:20,299 --> 00:48:22,366
What was I thinkin', huh?

495
00:48:24,005 --> 00:48:25,272
G'night.

496
00:49:36,945 --> 00:49:37,845
Kaley!

497
00:49:38,626 --> 00:49:41,126
Gimme your hand, gimme your hand!

498
00:49:49,002 --> 00:49:49,802
Kaley!

499
00:49:51,912 --> 00:49:52,712
Hey!

500
00:49:54,074 --> 00:49:54,874
Hey!

501
00:50:02,395 --> 00:50:03,862
Shoot, goddammit!

502
00:50:17,612 --> 00:50:18,945
You hurt? He get ya?

503
00:50:21,392 --> 00:50:23,858
Looks like your bear was trackin' us.

504
00:50:26,606 --> 00:50:28,639
Let's get our shit and get outta here.

505
00:50:48,502 --> 00:50:52,035
You mind explainin' to me what that was all about?

506
00:50:52,795 --> 00:50:54,428
You know what I'm talkin' about.

507
00:50:54,448 --> 00:50:56,448
- I didn't have a shot.
- You didn't have a shot?

508
00:50:56,468 --> 00:50:58,668
Come on. You might not get a better one.

509
00:50:59,088 --> 00:51:01,088
What were you doin' in that tent?

510
00:51:01,917 --> 00:51:04,017
- What?
- Shoulda been outside.

511
00:51:04,437 --> 00:51:06,837
- Was freezin' outside.
- Uh-huh.

512
00:51:12,276 --> 00:51:14,209
<i>Oh, come on... you were cold.</i>

513
00:51:25,211 --> 00:51:26,278
-What's goin' on?
- What's wrong?

514
00:51:31,552 --> 00:51:34,319
-Move yourself, right now.
- Get her arm, get her arm.

515
00:51:39,025 --> 00:51:40,025
You alright?

516
00:51:45,399 --> 00:51:47,132
We're in the kill zone.

517
00:51:47,818 --> 00:51:50,752
- Let's get outta here.
- Yeah. Let's move. C'mon.

518
00:52:10,012 --> 00:52:13,712
Damn. What do you think we should do?

519
00:52:14,844 --> 00:52:16,555
Let's just stick to Johnny's trail.

520
00:52:16,576 --> 00:52:19,264
I don't wanna take these
girls down in that maze.

521
00:52:19,284 --> 00:52:21,907
We should stick to Johnny's trail. It leads us,

522
00:52:21,927 --> 00:52:24,503
right down to Teredo Point, it's
just on the other side of the maze.

523
00:52:24,523 --> 00:52:28,523
We radio Sully. He can come in,
pick us up, take us out by boat.

524
00:52:33,221 --> 00:52:36,088
Wanna go back up that way, the way we came?

525
00:52:37,343 --> 00:52:41,643
- He's on our trail.
- Alright, let's try to lose him in the maze.

526
00:52:42,481 --> 00:52:43,947
It's our only shot.

527
00:52:57,288 --> 00:52:59,621
Sullivan, this is Beckett. Come in.

528
00:53:14,982 --> 00:53:15,982
Sully, wait up.

529
00:53:17,084 --> 00:53:23,384
Appreciate the help, Gerry, but I told ya already,
I need you back here to keep everybody calm.

530
00:53:23,404 --> 00:53:24,504
You're not going in there alone.

531
00:53:24,524 --> 00:53:28,324
If you haven't heard from me, by
tomorrow afternoon, call Fish and Game.

532
00:53:28,344 --> 00:53:32,144
- I should go with ya.
- Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

533
00:53:49,426 --> 00:53:50,359
Douglas!

534
00:53:51,179 --> 00:53:53,179
Man, that better not be one of my bears!

535
00:53:53,836 --> 00:53:55,536
Are you lookin' for this?

536
00:53:56,149 --> 00:54:00,415
Dammit! I told you, man. If you
fuck with one of my bears again...

537
00:54:02,331 --> 00:54:04,831
- I'll deal with it.
- I'll be damned! Rowan, is that you back there?

538
00:54:05,051 --> 00:54:08,151
They let you out? I guess I was wrong.

539
00:54:08,171 --> 00:54:09,971
There is a fellow hunter out here with me.

540
00:54:09,991 --> 00:54:12,591
I's just fixin' to cut this thing
open, you wanna come help me with it?

541
00:54:12,611 --> 00:54:15,111
I'd rather not. Back the fuck up!

542
00:54:15,131 --> 00:54:16,731
Hey, hey, hey. Hey!

543
00:54:16,751 --> 00:54:20,451
There's a camera on there, ya butcher! All
we gotta do is plug it in, see what he ate.

544
00:54:20,471 --> 00:54:22,571
Don't you go soft on me, too, son.

545
00:54:22,591 --> 00:54:25,239
Your brother, Beckett, here,
he thinks he knows bears

546
00:54:25,260 --> 00:54:27,711
'cause he puts them cute little necklaces on 'em.

547
00:54:27,731 --> 00:54:31,731
- But you and me know when there's a problem.
- You're the only fuckin' problem here, old man.

548
00:54:33,569 --> 00:54:36,302
Hey, Rowan, now you been gone a long time, bud.

549
00:54:36,322 --> 00:54:39,122
Lotta strange shit's happenin' around here.

550
00:54:39,742 --> 00:54:44,042
Beetle outbreaks. Salmon don't
swim upstream like they used to.

551
00:54:44,362 --> 00:54:46,362
Bears ain't got anything to eat.

552
00:54:46,782 --> 00:54:49,882
Throw people into that mix,
you're askin' for trouble.

553
00:54:49,902 --> 00:54:55,402
'Cause when a grizzly gets angry he don't give
a shit if you're a logger or a tree hugger.

554
00:54:56,222 --> 00:54:58,222
All of ya taste the same.

555
00:54:58,242 --> 00:55:01,242
Anyway, this ain't our bear.

556
00:55:01,262 --> 00:55:06,762
Don't look so sad, honey. That one was hurt, just
limpin' around. I just put it out of it's misery.

557
00:55:07,677 --> 00:55:12,810
But somewhere around here... there's a real rogue.

558
00:55:12,830 --> 00:55:15,630
A big, nasty, mean son of a bitch,

559
00:55:15,650 --> 00:55:18,950
and he don't give a shit what's
in his way, he'll eat it.

560
00:55:18,970 --> 00:55:20,570
Anything to survive.

561
00:55:20,590 --> 00:55:24,444
When a bear like that encounters man
for the first time, he just looks

562
00:55:24,465 --> 00:55:28,210
at him as a predator he's gotta get
rid of, 'fore it gets rid of him.

563
00:55:29,842 --> 00:55:33,042
- Yeah, well, let's find out.
- What you got?

564
00:55:39,824 --> 00:55:42,691
Holy shit! That's the bear from last night.

565
00:55:42,711 --> 00:55:46,811
See there? I told you so. Ripped
the collar off and broke his neck.

566
00:55:48,203 --> 00:55:49,403
Looks it. Yeah.

567
00:55:52,909 --> 00:55:56,309
Well, if y'all do run into him again...

568
00:55:56,929 --> 00:55:59,709
Split up to a 180. That way somebody can get a

569
00:55:59,730 --> 00:56:02,349
side shot, 'cause if he's
chargin', you won't get 'im.

570
00:56:03,735 --> 00:56:05,335
Y'all have fun.

571
00:56:07,198 --> 00:56:10,731
Ya say, Beck? Still wanna
play darts with this thing?

572
00:56:16,690 --> 00:56:17,757
I like it.

573
00:56:42,445 --> 00:56:43,345
Bear!

574
00:57:01,744 --> 00:57:02,811
Watch your step!

575
00:57:15,990 --> 00:57:16,790
No!

576
00:57:16,879 --> 00:57:17,679
Jesus!

577
00:57:17,699 --> 00:57:18,699
Kaley!

578
00:57:28,539 --> 00:57:29,439
Oh, my...

579
00:57:39,796 --> 00:57:41,696
- Tell me what to do. What do I do?
- OK.

580
00:57:41,716 --> 00:57:43,016
You need to cut the branch.

581
00:57:43,036 --> 00:57:45,036
- Cut the branch.
- Yeah.

582
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:48,720
OK. You're OK. We're gonna get you outta here.

583
00:57:48,740 --> 00:57:49,940
It's not as bad as it looks.

584
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:52,860
OK. Alright. Is anything broken?
Alright. Think it's broken?

585
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:54,880
I gotta see it. I gotta see it.

586
00:57:55,337 --> 00:57:56,604
- Let's cut this off.
- How red's it get?

587
00:58:03,715 --> 00:58:04,615
It's fucking...

588
00:58:11,496 --> 00:58:13,063
You gotta pull it out.

589
00:58:13,116 --> 00:58:15,116
- What?
- You gotta pull it out.

590
00:58:15,136 --> 00:58:16,736
We got-you gotta pull it out.
You gotta pull it out.

591
00:58:16,756 --> 00:58:19,456
No, no, no. We pull it out,
she's gonna lose a lotta blood.

592
00:58:19,476 --> 00:58:20,776
Walkin' around with a stick in her leg?

593
00:58:20,796 --> 00:58:22,396
Well, just gimme a second. I can cut it off.

594
00:58:22,416 --> 00:58:24,716
- Then we're still hangin' around...
- No, no, don't, no. Just pull it out, OK?

595
00:58:24,736 --> 00:58:27,336
We're gonna stop the bleeding.
I can get up and stitch, OK?

596
00:58:27,356 --> 00:58:29,556
Just stabilize the ankle and
then he can pull it out.

597
00:58:32,214 --> 00:58:35,614
- I'll get the knee, you get the ankle.
- Alright. Keep it steady.

598
00:58:36,534 --> 00:58:37,434
OK.

599
00:58:37,454 --> 00:58:38,854
OK. On three, alright?

600
00:58:38,874 --> 00:58:43,174
- Ah!
- One, two... three.

601
00:58:45,575 --> 00:58:46,475
OK.

602
00:58:48,830 --> 00:58:49,930
God!

603
00:58:53,305 --> 00:58:56,072
- Almost done.
- Pressure, pressure.

604
00:58:56,092 --> 00:58:58,092
Gauze! Here's some gauze.

605
00:58:58,512 --> 00:59:00,512
- OK. Put this, on here.
- Both sides.

606
00:59:05,283 --> 00:59:07,483
W-what'd she say? What'd she say?

607
00:59:07,503 --> 00:59:10,503
When a bear smells the blood... we
gotta get rid of these clothes.

608
00:59:11,466 --> 00:59:14,166
You'll be alright. We'll get you outta here.

609
00:59:16,666 --> 00:59:17,600
We gotta move.

610
00:59:20,653 --> 00:59:22,986
Radio Sully. I'm sure he's on his way.

611
00:59:23,007 --> 00:59:25,607
Uh, go on. Here we go. There we go.

612
00:59:25,627 --> 00:59:28,227
There you go, darlin'. We gotcha, we gotcha.

613
00:59:31,168 --> 00:59:34,034
Sully. Sully, come in.

614
00:59:41,675 --> 00:59:43,408
Sullivan, this is Beckett.

615
00:59:43,628 --> 00:59:44,828
Come in.

616
00:59:45,482 --> 00:59:46,582
Anything?

617
00:59:47,999 --> 00:59:50,066
Too deep in the maze.

618
00:59:52,257 --> 00:59:55,990
- Fuck.
- Sullivan. Do you read me? This is Beckett.

619
01:00:24,722 --> 01:00:26,289
Jesus Christ!

620
01:00:34,199 --> 01:00:35,132
Alright.

621
01:00:40,644 --> 01:00:43,311
- Uh, it's so slippery. Uh!
- OK.

622
01:00:46,436 --> 01:00:48,269
- Hang on.
- Wait here a minute.

623
01:00:55,362 --> 01:00:57,696
- Alright.
- What-what is it?

624
01:00:58,843 --> 01:01:01,510
- It's a cabin.
- Oh, thank God.

625
01:01:05,874 --> 01:01:07,607
OK, now, just lean on me.

626
01:01:12,774 --> 01:01:13,674
Oh...

627
01:01:19,857 --> 01:01:21,190
Here. Sit down here.

628
01:01:21,525 --> 01:01:22,558
There you go, honey.

629
01:01:22,578 --> 01:01:24,078
- Ya got her?
- Yeah.

630
01:01:24,098 --> 01:01:25,598
Hey, easy, now.

631
01:01:26,118 --> 01:01:28,118
There, that's it.

632
01:01:35,063 --> 01:01:40,463
Rowan! Wait! Wait, God... damn it!

633
01:01:45,005 --> 01:01:46,805
See this?

634
01:01:46,825 --> 01:01:48,825
- Gall bladders.
- Paws.

635
01:01:50,509 --> 01:01:52,509
Oh, the big money.

636
01:02:00,867 --> 01:02:04,067
Who's that? Is that him? Is that Johnny?

637
01:02:06,442 --> 01:02:07,342
Nah.

638
01:02:09,468 --> 01:02:10,668
Get the hell outta here.

639
01:02:12,008 --> 01:02:13,508
Don't touch anything!

640
01:02:16,132 --> 01:02:17,232
Let's go.

641
01:02:20,453 --> 01:02:21,920
C'mon, we gotta go.

642
01:02:22,039 --> 01:02:25,006
- What's wrong?
- We can't stay here.

643
01:02:25,947 --> 01:02:28,613
Still think those guys are worth savin'?

644
01:02:29,853 --> 01:02:30,887
Oh, my God.

645
01:02:32,584 --> 01:02:34,384
Goddamn savages.

646
01:02:36,319 --> 01:02:37,219
C'mon.

647
01:02:38,113 --> 01:02:40,613
- Let's go.
- OK.

648
01:02:41,904 --> 01:02:43,671
Watch it. Watch yourself.

649
01:02:46,103 --> 01:02:48,203
Hey. Lean on me, there.

650
01:02:53,042 --> 01:02:54,142
I gotcha.

651
01:03:06,963 --> 01:03:08,396
There's your boy.

652
01:03:14,067 --> 01:03:16,234
- No, don't do that. Leave 'im...
- Fuck off!

653
01:03:16,254 --> 01:03:18,190
Leave 'im up there. We'll come back and get help.

654
01:03:18,211 --> 01:03:22,074
You take 'im down now, the goddam
bear'll leave nothin' to bury.

655
01:03:24,424 --> 01:03:28,157
- I imagine you woulda liked that.
- Look, I'm sorry about that, OK?

656
01:03:30,692 --> 01:03:31,758
It's back!

657
01:03:32,098 --> 01:03:34,631
Douglas! What the hell you doin' out here, man?

658
01:03:34,651 --> 01:03:36,251
Fucking hell, Douglas.

659
01:03:36,790 --> 01:03:39,057
Looks like your bear found Johnny.

660
01:03:41,852 --> 01:03:43,052
Good God almighty!

661
01:03:44,716 --> 01:03:46,049
Lord, have mercy!

662
01:03:46,252 --> 01:03:48,585
Chewed his leg, right off.

663
01:03:48,632 --> 01:03:51,499
It wasn't the bear that killed him, though.
Lookee, there.

664
01:03:51,519 --> 01:03:53,019
He was shot.

665
01:03:53,039 --> 01:03:56,139
I had a bad feelin' when I saw
him hangin' out with them guys.

666
01:03:56,159 --> 01:03:58,159
You have anything to do with this, Douglas?

667
01:03:58,179 --> 01:03:59,879
With this? Hell, no!

668
01:04:01,165 --> 01:04:06,965
They came to me, first, and they was snoopin'
around for a guide and... I turned 'em down.

669
01:04:06,985 --> 01:04:09,785
- I knew what they was up to.
- What?

670
01:04:09,805 --> 01:04:12,605
I seen 'em down at the truck stop, all of 'em.

671
01:04:12,625 --> 01:04:14,225
What you talkin' about?

672
01:04:16,132 --> 01:04:19,799
- Why don't you ask your boss?
- My boss. Sully?

673
01:04:19,819 --> 01:04:22,719
You spend too much time huggin' trees, pardner.

674
01:04:23,339 --> 01:04:25,339
Johnny shoulda known better.

675
01:04:25,359 --> 01:04:27,959
I may be a lotta things, y'all, but...

676
01:04:29,075 --> 01:04:31,675
what these guys are up to is pure evil.

677
01:04:31,995 --> 01:04:35,095
You start messin' with evil, you
open up the door to the devil.

678
01:04:35,515 --> 01:04:37,815
Well, so we're in hell, now.

679
01:04:38,932 --> 01:04:40,832
What're you up to, over there?

680
01:04:40,852 --> 01:04:43,952
Kaley's hurt. She can't walk.
Gonna take your horse.

681
01:04:43,972 --> 01:04:47,072
- Is that right?
- That's right.

682
01:04:47,092 --> 01:04:50,764
Well, listen, normally, I wouldn't mind
givin' y'all a ride on ol' Gus, but

683
01:04:50,785 --> 01:04:54,212
see, right now, we're huntin', and
we don't need no damn distractions.

684
01:04:54,232 --> 01:04:58,532
Well, you can keep on huntin'...
I just need ol' Gus.

685
01:04:58,552 --> 01:05:03,252
See, if I don't find that bear, before it
finds y'all... ain't gonna make it, anyway.

686
01:05:03,872 --> 01:05:07,372
- And it will hunt you. Trust me.
- That's a risk we'll take.

687
01:05:07,392 --> 01:05:09,992
Give the old man his horse back, Rowan.

688
01:05:11,470 --> 01:05:13,203
Give 'im the horse, Rowan.

689
01:05:18,512 --> 01:05:19,779
Come on, Gus.

690
01:05:20,399 --> 01:05:21,899
Y'all like bein' hunted?

691
01:05:23,319 --> 01:05:26,119
Ain't a damn bit o' fun, believe me.

692
01:05:30,062 --> 01:05:32,529
I hope you know what you're doin'.

693
01:05:37,249 --> 01:05:38,582
Leaks more, we gotta carry her.

694
01:05:39,002 --> 01:05:40,902
Take my arm, let's carry ya.

695
01:05:40,922 --> 01:05:43,622
- OK, I got her.
- Gotcha.

696
01:05:43,942 --> 01:05:46,142
How come you never asked me what happened?

697
01:05:46,562 --> 01:05:49,762
What's there to know? Ya...
smuggled booze and shot a man.

698
01:05:49,782 --> 01:05:52,482
Alright! I got it.

699
01:05:52,902 --> 01:05:56,702
Let's just get outta here... and go our
separate ways, for good? How 'bout that?

700
01:05:56,722 --> 01:05:58,722
That's the best idea you've ever had.

701
01:05:58,742 --> 01:06:00,742
Uh, I don't feel too good.

702
01:06:00,762 --> 01:06:03,362
OK, I need to keep it elevated for awhile.

703
01:06:03,382 --> 01:06:06,582
Michelle says... Kaley needs the restroom.

704
01:06:07,230 --> 01:06:10,263
Oh, what? No, no.

705
01:06:10,284 --> 01:06:13,984
It's taken us two hours to go one mile. It's
double the amount of time it shoulda taken.

706
01:06:14,104 --> 01:06:15,904
We got no time.

707
01:06:15,924 --> 01:06:19,724
No, you're... I'm not bein' stubborn! You're
the one bein' stubborn. I know she's hurt.

708
01:06:20,944 --> 01:06:24,301
Alright, w... we're gonna wait here...
for a little while,

709
01:06:24,322 --> 01:06:28,764
but we gotta get outta here, way
before the sun comes up. OK?

710
01:06:42,930 --> 01:06:45,797
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

711
01:06:46,927 --> 01:06:48,527
Can you get some sleep?

712
01:06:49,748 --> 01:06:51,548
Did you really shoot a man?

713
01:06:55,407 --> 01:06:57,440
- Get some sleep.
- Please, Rowan.

714
01:06:58,061 --> 01:07:02,161
I need to know. Don't make it be for nothing.

715
01:07:03,181 --> 01:07:06,985
You know, the last time I came up here
was with my dad, in the dead of Winter.

716
01:07:07,006 --> 01:07:11,601
My mom was not doin' great.
She needed the operation.

717
01:07:12,621 --> 01:07:14,221
But we had nothing.

718
01:07:14,541 --> 01:07:18,941
All I knew was, may dad just...
he needed to be up here.

719
01:07:19,561 --> 01:07:23,661
It's, like, the only place in the
world, he felt, made any sense to him.

720
01:07:24,340 --> 01:07:25,807
And the first night...

721
01:07:26,881 --> 01:07:30,876
I wake up and I hear this... weird sound, and

722
01:07:30,897 --> 01:07:34,401
so I poked my head outside the
tent and it's snowing, and...

723
01:07:35,901 --> 01:07:38,101
and I see him. He's got his back turned to me...

724
01:07:39,148 --> 01:07:42,281
and he's... sobbing.

725
01:07:43,409 --> 01:07:46,377
Dad was the strongest man I've
ever met, and could survive

726
01:07:46,398 --> 01:07:48,962
in the wilderness, with a
hunting knife, for weeks.

727
01:07:48,982 --> 01:07:53,782
And there he was... cryin' his heart
out 'cause he couldn't save my mom.

728
01:07:56,635 --> 01:08:00,868
And that... uh... wrecked me.

729
01:08:00,888 --> 01:08:06,388
So, I went to Johnny Cadillac. He was the only
guy I knew who could get money, on the fly.

730
01:08:06,408 --> 01:08:11,308
I mean, he was harmless, I mean, he was
sellin' weed, to, you know, make ends meet.

731
01:08:11,328 --> 01:08:13,228
But his supplier was, the real deal.

732
01:08:13,248 --> 01:08:18,048
They were smuggling booze to, some of the
Indian towns, and they needed a guide.

733
01:08:18,068 --> 01:08:23,568
Um... the way I saw it, I didn't really
have a choice. So, I took the job.

734
01:08:23,588 --> 01:08:27,288
Um, easy enough. Everything went
smoothly, right up to the exchange.

735
01:08:27,308 --> 01:08:32,008
The, all of a sudden, we
get hit by State Troopers.

736
01:08:33,028 --> 01:08:35,928
And I found myself right in the
middle of a fuckin' shootout.

737
01:08:36,268 --> 01:08:37,435
So, what did you do?

738
01:08:37,456 --> 01:08:40,655
Well, I took the bag of money
and I ran off into the woods.

739
01:08:40,675 --> 01:08:45,075
I noticed there was a Trooper that'd...
been hit in the leg,

740
01:08:46,295 --> 01:08:50,795
crawlin' away, for his life, and one of
the smugglers, comin' up from behind him,

741
01:08:50,815 --> 01:08:52,815
just ready to put another one right in his head.

742
01:08:54,171 --> 01:08:57,304
Jesus, one of those moments, when
you're just, like, what the f...

743
01:08:57,324 --> 01:09:00,424
How the hell did I get here, in the first place?

744
01:09:04,979 --> 01:09:09,879
So, as soon as I saw the guy
raise his gun, I just...

745
01:09:11,099 --> 01:09:13,099
well, I stopped and I shot him.

746
01:09:14,976 --> 01:09:16,709
I weirded everyone my way.

747
01:09:18,271 --> 01:09:21,004
Fifteen seconds cost me seven years.

748
01:09:22,224 --> 01:09:25,424
- But, you saved a cop's life.
- I still killed a man.

749
01:09:26,044 --> 01:09:28,244
And I was the one holdin' the cash.

750
01:09:28,264 --> 01:09:33,964
I remember handin' over that bag of money
was like... puttin' my mom in the grave.

751
01:09:36,099 --> 01:09:38,599
Why didn't you tell anyone?

752
01:09:38,619 --> 01:09:44,919
I don't really have a great history of... people
in this town believin' what I have to say.

753
01:09:47,128 --> 01:09:49,328
You could've told me.

754
01:09:54,881 --> 01:09:56,614
I'm sorry, Rowan.

755
01:09:57,234 --> 01:10:00,534
- I'm so sorry.
- It's OK.

756
01:10:03,130 --> 01:10:04,630
Get some sleep.

757
01:10:06,050 --> 01:10:08,550
Michelle's probably freezin' out there.

758
01:10:37,741 --> 01:10:43,674
Listen, I was thinkin' maybe, uh... maybe
you and Michelle should just keep movin'.

759
01:10:44,494 --> 01:10:47,594
- I'll stay back, with Kaley, and...
- No.

760
01:10:51,714 --> 01:10:54,247
This time, we're stickin' together.

761
01:10:57,324 --> 01:11:01,924
For better or for worse. We stick together.

762
01:11:19,881 --> 01:11:20,881
Whoa.

763
01:11:41,103 --> 01:11:43,836
Buddy, I think we're in for a long night.

764
01:12:04,946 --> 01:12:07,613
- Hear that?
- Gotta give it to him. He's one hell of a hunter.

765
01:12:18,705 --> 01:12:21,072
- Jesus, Rowan, you alright?
 - Yeah.

766
01:12:24,903 --> 01:12:25,936
Douglas!

767
01:12:26,870 --> 01:12:27,903
Douglas!

768
01:12:30,754 --> 01:12:31,821
Holy hell!

769
01:12:37,102 --> 01:12:38,202
Beck!

770
01:12:46,174 --> 01:12:47,174
Oh, shit.

771
01:12:50,392 --> 01:12:52,259
Rowan?! Rowan!

772
01:12:53,138 --> 01:12:55,038
- Kaley!
- Kaley!

773
01:12:55,566 --> 01:12:56,466
Kaley!

774
01:12:58,696 --> 01:13:00,196
Oh, what happened?

775
01:13:00,367 --> 01:13:02,334
Douglas is dead. He's dead.

776
01:13:02,354 --> 01:13:05,154
Leave the tent. Leave everything.
We're gettin' the hell outta here.

777
01:13:05,374 --> 01:13:07,474
- I'm stayin' here.
- What?

778
01:13:07,494 --> 01:13:08,994
- You heard me.
- The hell, you are!

779
01:13:09,014 --> 01:13:12,014
- Trust me, I know what I'm doin'.
- Rowan, no. It's suicide.

780
01:13:12,434 --> 01:13:14,434
I'm gonna lead it in the other direction.

781
01:13:14,756 --> 01:13:17,723
- You take the girls down to the beach.
- What?! No!

782
01:13:17,743 --> 01:13:21,343
- You heard me. Come on.
- No, you know, I'll do it. OK?

783
01:13:21,363 --> 01:13:24,363
I'm faster, and what, you're stronger.
Carry Kaley on your back.

784
01:13:26,276 --> 01:13:27,409
Come on.

785
01:13:30,150 --> 01:13:31,750
There's five rounds left.

786
01:13:31,770 --> 01:13:33,770
There's one in the chamber.

787
01:13:34,079 --> 01:13:35,945
Make every shot count.

788
01:13:38,944 --> 01:13:41,877
- Asshole.
- Yeah, I know.

789
01:13:46,794 --> 01:13:49,661
It's not gonna be able to move
as fast as me, in the maze.

790
01:13:49,681 --> 01:13:51,681
Wait, what are-what are you doing?

791
01:13:51,701 --> 01:13:54,901
You're gonna play tag with it? It's crazy.

792
01:13:54,921 --> 01:13:59,221
Please.... it's our best shot.

793
01:14:12,456 --> 01:14:13,256
Go.

794
01:14:14,276 --> 01:14:17,076
Get outta here. Go!

795
01:14:59,370 --> 01:15:00,303
How far?

796
01:15:00,723 --> 01:15:02,323
Two miles, maybe.

797
01:15:02,328 --> 01:15:04,695
I need-I need a break
because it's really painful.

798
01:15:04,714 --> 01:15:07,314
OK, OK, here. By this tree.

799
01:15:07,834 --> 01:15:08,934
Easy.

800
01:15:15,112 --> 01:15:17,912
I'm gonna have to take a look at this leg.

801
01:15:18,226 --> 01:15:21,393
Easy, now. Just gonna cut these off. Alright.

802
01:15:24,643 --> 01:15:25,776
Oh, God.

803
01:16:14,133 --> 01:16:15,333
Let's go.

804
01:16:29,081 --> 01:16:30,181
Oh, shit!

805
01:16:37,943 --> 01:16:39,143
Oh, fuck!

806
01:17:53,904 --> 01:17:54,937
Wait up.

807
01:18:01,698 --> 01:18:02,798
Rowan!

808
01:18:03,518 --> 01:18:04,718
Rowan!

809
01:18:13,521 --> 01:18:14,655
That's not Rowan!

810
01:18:47,380 --> 01:18:49,280
Where the hell is he?

811
01:19:00,778 --> 01:19:01,878
Fuck!

812
01:20:08,639 --> 01:20:09,539
Hey!

813
01:20:59,230 --> 01:21:00,130
God.

814
01:21:00,710 --> 01:21:01,710
OK.

815
01:21:20,235 --> 01:21:21,935
I gotta put you down.

816
01:21:24,828 --> 01:21:27,261
- Where's Sully?
- He's here.

817
01:21:28,454 --> 01:21:30,687
Help me. Help me.

818
01:21:50,629 --> 01:21:52,063
Where's Rowan?

819
01:21:52,563 --> 01:21:55,630
Rowan's gone! Douglas is gone, too.

820
01:21:55,650 --> 01:21:58,450
And I oughtta leave your ass right here.

821
01:21:59,505 --> 01:22:02,305
- Sully!
- Alright! I took money!

822
01:22:02,325 --> 01:22:06,025
I turned the poachers loose. I didn't
know this shit was gonna go down.

823
01:22:06,045 --> 01:22:10,345
Son, I'm retiring... and I got fuckin' nothin'!

824
01:22:10,365 --> 01:22:13,765
- Sully.
- Behind you!

825
01:22:24,136 --> 01:22:25,036
Sully!

826
01:22:31,736 --> 01:22:32,869
Oh, my God!

827
01:22:38,324 --> 01:22:39,524
Rowan!

828
01:22:39,744 --> 01:22:41,744
Beckett, it's Rowan!

829
01:22:52,374 --> 01:22:53,574
Hey! Hey!

830
01:22:56,292 --> 01:22:58,092
Hey! Fuckin' quit!

831
01:23:08,849 --> 01:23:09,749
OK.

832
01:23:11,573 --> 01:23:13,706
Come on! Hey!

833
01:23:14,551 --> 01:23:16,351
Hey! Hey!

834
01:23:16,371 --> 01:23:18,571
Come on, come on, come on, come, on!

835
01:23:27,718 --> 01:23:28,918
C'mere fucker!

836
01:23:28,938 --> 01:23:30,138
Hey, hey hey!

837
01:23:30,767 --> 01:23:32,000
Here, here!

838
01:23:37,227 --> 01:23:38,660
Yeah, yeah! C'mon?!

839
01:23:58,396 --> 01:24:00,229
- Alright?
- OK.

840
01:24:00,449 --> 01:24:02,449
- Sully.
- He's gone.

841
01:24:03,169 --> 01:24:06,169
Come on, keep movin'. Let's get outta here.

842
01:24:06,502 --> 01:24:07,402
Here.

843
01:24:10,509 --> 01:24:11,642
Oh, my God!

844
01:24:12,118 --> 01:24:14,351
- Whoa!
- Pull!

845
01:24:14,371 --> 01:24:15,771
Move! Move!

846
01:24:15,791 --> 01:24:17,791
Buckle it!

847
01:24:20,546 --> 01:24:21,846
Beckett, hurry!

848
01:24:23,077 --> 01:24:24,210
Go, go, go!

849
01:24:45,612 --> 01:24:46,612
Michelle!

850
01:24:50,528 --> 01:24:51,428
Rowan!

851
01:24:51,448 --> 01:24:52,348
Shit!

852
01:25:11,854 --> 01:25:12,654
Go!

853
01:25:30,621 --> 01:25:32,188
Rowan, no!

854
01:25:58,625 --> 01:26:01,125
No! Rowan!

855
01:26:27,198 --> 01:26:28,098
Rowan.

856
01:26:36,565 --> 01:26:37,465
Rowan.

857
01:26:39,839 --> 01:26:43,072
- Help me up.
- Alright. Can you move?

858
01:26:45,602 --> 01:26:46,569
Gotcha.

859
01:26:48,807 --> 01:26:49,774
Come here.

860
01:26:59,843 --> 01:27:01,476
Welcome home, Rowan.
