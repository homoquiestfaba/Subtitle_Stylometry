00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:12,746
[Gasping and panting]

2
00:00:15,381 --> 00:00:18,318
[Straining and shrieking]

3
00:00:21,922 --> 00:00:23,890
I'm just trying to
talk to you about it.

4
00:00:23,924 --> 00:00:26,426
I'm just trying to talk to you about it,
all right?

5
00:00:26,459 --> 00:00:28,428
I'm not trying to blame you.

6
00:00:28,461 --> 00:00:30,764
Obviously, I'm trying to
blame you a little bit.

7
00:00:30,797 --> 00:00:33,399
No! No!

8
00:01:05,498 --> 00:01:09,435
No! No! No! No!

9
00:01:15,676 --> 00:01:17,944
I gotta finish this.

10
00:01:17,978 --> 00:01:20,914
We don't need to keep
talking about this.

11
00:01:25,852 --> 00:01:28,454
But we do need to keep going.

12
00:01:31,692 --> 00:01:34,460
All right, you can have
a second to rest up.

13
00:02:57,711 --> 00:02:59,680
Want some water?

14
00:02:59,713 --> 00:03:01,982
Yes, please.
Water would be nice.

15
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,997
Don't! You tried
to hit me.

16
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,032
You hit me. No I didn't.

17
00:03:19,065 --> 00:03:21,434
Yes you did.
You hit me.

18
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:25,772
You see that?
You strangled me.

19
00:03:25,806 --> 00:03:27,808
You had me in a strangle hold.

20
00:03:27,841 --> 00:03:29,819
You're going to tell me you didn't
try to hit me and strangle me?

21
00:03:29,843 --> 00:03:31,821
I think we had a misunderstanding,
but if you thought I tried

22
00:03:31,845 --> 00:03:33,579
to strangle
you I'm sorry. You did.

23
00:03:40,821 --> 00:03:43,690
I'm sorry I broke
your cell phone.

24
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:31,571
[Woman] How long does it take
to get to the everglades?

25
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:33,907
[Man] Four hours.

26
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,376
Maybe five.

27
00:04:39,179 --> 00:04:42,849
We gotta take a route
that don't make sense,

28
00:04:42,883 --> 00:04:45,185
if you look at it
on paper, but..

29
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:47,420
We gotta trip 'em up.

30
00:04:49,189 --> 00:04:51,024
[Man] We're going to tampa.

31
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:54,160
[Woman] Why tampa?

32
00:04:54,194 --> 00:04:56,863
[Man] 'Cause I got
a friend there.

33
00:04:56,897 --> 00:05:00,166
And, um...

34
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,936
I think she can
help US out. She?

35
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:07,107
She got a boat?

36
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:10,611
No.

37
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:13,213
But I gotta be alone with her.

38
00:05:13,246 --> 00:05:15,215
Why?

39
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:18,218
Why do you have to
be alone with her?

40
00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:21,554
So no one knows we're together.

41
00:06:20,814 --> 00:06:22,949
Where'd you fucking
throw that thing?

42
00:06:22,983 --> 00:06:26,953
[Sobbing]

43
00:06:26,987 --> 00:06:29,255
I'm sorry.

44
00:06:29,289 --> 00:06:30,891
Do you see why we don't want

45
00:06:30,924 --> 00:06:32,802
to be putting stuff on the
side of the road like that?

46
00:06:32,826 --> 00:06:34,761
Yes. I do.

47
00:06:36,296 --> 00:06:38,264
I'm sorry.

48
00:06:38,298 --> 00:06:40,233
It's okay, crystal.

49
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:45,138
I'm sorry.

50
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:47,140
It's okay, all right?

51
00:06:47,173 --> 00:06:49,142
You ready to go get
our sandwiches now?

52
00:06:49,175 --> 00:06:51,544
Yes.

53
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:53,213
It's okay. You
don't need a shirt.

54
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:55,215
I'll give you mine,
all right. Okay?

55
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:57,217
Get back up here,
I'll give you my shirt.

56
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,185
We'll go eat our
sandwiches, all right?

57
00:07:01,054 --> 00:07:02,989
Thank you.

58
00:07:04,324 --> 00:07:09,029
[Thunder rumbling]

59
00:08:08,254 --> 00:08:10,223
You wanna just wait right here?

60
00:08:10,256 --> 00:08:12,058
While I go in for two seconds?

61
00:08:12,092 --> 00:08:13,860
Sure.

62
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:18,158
What were you doing over there?

63
00:09:18,191 --> 00:09:19,760
I've gotta buy Marla a present.

64
00:09:32,172 --> 00:09:33,974
Crystal, let's go.

65
00:09:34,007 --> 00:09:35,976
It's gonna take,
like, two seconds.

66
00:09:36,009 --> 00:09:37,811
Can we do this later?

67
00:09:37,844 --> 00:09:39,813
No! I told her i'd
buy her a present.

68
00:09:39,846 --> 00:09:42,315
When?

69
00:09:42,348 --> 00:09:44,150
When did you tell her you were

70
00:09:44,184 --> 00:09:46,152
going to buy
her a present? Before!

71
00:09:46,186 --> 00:09:49,455
You just talked
to her. No I didn't!

72
00:09:49,489 --> 00:09:52,425
Is that what you want?
Give me the mermaid.

73
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:03,303
I didn't call anyone.

74
00:10:23,023 --> 00:10:25,859
I don't think your girlfriend
is going to help US.

75
00:10:25,892 --> 00:10:29,495
She's not my girlfriend. I know
you talked to your mother back there.

76
00:10:29,529 --> 00:10:31,497
Was she your girlfriend before?

77
00:10:31,531 --> 00:10:33,333
No. Will you just admit that?

78
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:36,803
I wanna go to a motel.

79
00:10:41,407 --> 00:10:44,811
I wanna go to a motel
and make love.

80
00:10:44,845 --> 00:10:48,048
Did you tell her
you were with me?

81
00:10:48,081 --> 00:10:50,951
You don't want to
make love to me.

82
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:53,086
You were supposed to
tell her you were at home.

83
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:55,421
You think I got fat.

84
00:10:55,455 --> 00:10:58,191
Crys, I know you talked to your
mom back there on the phone.

85
00:10:58,224 --> 00:11:00,193
Did you tell her
you were with me?

86
00:11:00,226 --> 00:11:02,896
No I didn't! No, I'm not stupid!

87
00:11:02,929 --> 00:11:04,798
Fuck! I'm going to have to stop.

88
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,399
You want to take me
to this woman's

89
00:11:06,432 --> 00:11:09,169
house so you can fuck her,
and you think I deserve it!

90
00:11:09,202 --> 00:11:12,402
For dillydallying around right there,
it's going to overheat again. I gotta stop.

91
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:20,480
You wouldn't treat me this way
if I had big fake tits and lips.

92
00:11:22,282 --> 00:11:24,550
I could get a body like that

93
00:11:24,584 --> 00:11:27,520
and then all the men would want
me and you'd be sorry.

94
00:11:30,957 --> 00:11:33,259
You know, that's what
you want isn't it?

95
00:11:33,293 --> 00:11:35,304
You want one of those skinny
girls in the magazines.

96
00:11:35,328 --> 00:11:37,306
I don't like those girls. Yes you do.
Every man does.

97
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:39,541
You never would have tried to
strangle a girl that looked like that.

98
00:11:39,565 --> 00:11:41,301
I didn't try to strangle you.

99
00:11:41,334 --> 00:11:43,279
You don't want to be with
me because I have a daughter.

100
00:11:43,303 --> 00:11:46,272
That's not true. Yes, it is.

101
00:11:46,306 --> 00:11:49,242
My hips are big from having
Marla and you think it's disgusting.

102
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:51,612
What do you want me to do?
What else do you want me to do?

103
00:11:51,645 --> 00:11:53,579
I never hit you.

104
00:11:53,614 --> 00:11:56,082
And your hips aren't disgusting,
and I don't like

105
00:11:56,116 --> 00:11:58,084
fucking fake model tits.

106
00:11:58,118 --> 00:12:00,220
Your tits are fine
and your face is pretty.

107
00:12:00,253 --> 00:12:02,398
All right, if you want to be
mad at me for helping you out

108
00:12:02,422 --> 00:12:03,890
on your dirty shit.

109
00:12:03,924 --> 00:12:05,291
Do you know what
this situation is?

110
00:12:05,325 --> 00:12:06,869
Do you know how much
I am helping you out

111
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:09,529
on this fucked up situation?

112
00:12:12,532 --> 00:12:14,300
Fuck.

113
00:12:14,334 --> 00:12:16,069
Should we go?

114
00:12:16,102 --> 00:12:19,139
We can't fucking go.
We can't go anywhere.

115
00:12:21,374 --> 00:12:23,944
Hey, sir. Y'all having
car trouble?

116
00:12:23,977 --> 00:12:28,248
Not much. We're in good shape. Just
had to pour a little water in the radiator.

117
00:12:28,281 --> 00:12:30,617
I was broken down last week,

118
00:12:30,651 --> 00:12:33,253
on the side of
the road for hours,

119
00:12:33,286 --> 00:12:35,155
until somebody, an angel,

120
00:12:35,188 --> 00:12:36,923
pulled over and helped me.

121
00:12:36,957 --> 00:12:38,291
So, when I saw y'all pulled over

122
00:12:38,324 --> 00:12:39,902
I figured it was my turn
to return the favor.

123
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:41,995
Sure. Sure. Sure.

124
00:12:42,028 --> 00:12:44,473
Fortunately we don't need anything
like that, but thanks for helping.

125
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:46,132
Y'all need a jump?

126
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:47,968
Nope.

127
00:12:48,001 --> 00:12:51,471
Well... I thought my
car had overheated too,

128
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:54,474
and turns out,
it was the battery.

129
00:12:54,507 --> 00:12:56,576
Well can't hurt to try.

130
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:58,645
Y'all got jumper cables
in the trunk?

131
00:12:58,679 --> 00:13:00,647
No. There's nothing
in the trunk.

132
00:13:00,681 --> 00:13:03,183
Don't got any jumper
cables in the trunk.

133
00:13:03,216 --> 00:13:05,118
Like I said, I appreciate
your helping out,

134
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:07,187
but this is a normal
problem I have.

135
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:09,531
I just gotta put some water in
the radiator and let it cool off.

136
00:13:09,555 --> 00:13:12,525
I hear you. I got
a tow truck guy.

137
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:14,527
I don't need a tow truck guy.

138
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,497
If you can just
put up your phone.

139
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:20,166
Just gonna sit here
and let it cool off.

140
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,302
Appreciate your help, but...

141
00:13:24,237 --> 00:13:26,206
Suit yourself.

142
00:13:26,239 --> 00:13:29,542
I'll stick around at least,
until y'all get it started.

143
00:13:29,575 --> 00:13:32,312
No good being stuck
in this heat.

144
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,650
Um, I'm in real estate,

145
00:13:36,683 --> 00:13:39,052
and I was taking some clients

146
00:13:39,085 --> 00:13:41,221
to a property.

147
00:13:41,254 --> 00:13:45,558
Had them in the car, the car starts
making this weird rattling sound.

148
00:13:45,591 --> 00:13:49,062
Eight weeks, since I had a sale.

149
00:13:49,095 --> 00:13:50,697
My first sale in eight weeks.

150
00:13:50,731 --> 00:13:53,233
And I could not believe it,
the car just craps out,

151
00:13:53,266 --> 00:13:55,301
just totally shits out
on me right there...

152
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:58,271
With the clients,
in the car, in the heat.

153
00:14:01,742 --> 00:14:06,146
I had a dog die on me once
in the heat in the car.

154
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:10,183
They, uh,
they got a zoo up there in Atlanta.

155
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:14,020
It's a real piece of shit,
I mean, is was a piece of shit.

156
00:14:14,054 --> 00:14:16,356
Olympics came through
and cleaned it up.

157
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:19,626
They have this thing there called
the cyclorama. Y'all ever been?

158
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:21,628
Nope.

159
00:14:21,662 --> 00:14:25,632
It's this big piece of fabric.

160
00:14:25,666 --> 00:14:27,567
They've got all these
civil war battles

161
00:14:27,601 --> 00:14:29,402
painted on 'em.

162
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:31,738
Appomattox, all these
other ones, anyway.

163
00:14:31,772 --> 00:14:35,075
My parents took me there,
'bout five years old.

164
00:14:35,108 --> 00:14:38,078
Got our dog in the
back seat of the car...

165
00:14:38,111 --> 00:14:39,746
Big great Dane named rommel.

166
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:42,048
I need to talk to
my girlfriend alone.

167
00:14:42,082 --> 00:14:44,017
No sweat. Go right ahead.

168
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:49,656
Crystal, get in the car.

169
00:15:08,508 --> 00:15:10,443
Appreciate your help sir.

170
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:31,765
Good luck.

171
00:15:48,849 --> 00:15:51,718
That man is going
to call the police.

172
00:15:51,752 --> 00:15:53,654
I'm sorry.

173
00:15:53,687 --> 00:15:55,656
I didn't know what to do.

174
00:15:55,689 --> 00:15:57,490
It's not your fault.

175
00:15:57,523 --> 00:15:59,525
You were acting a
little bit alarming,

176
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:01,527
but it's not your fault.

177
00:16:01,561 --> 00:16:04,831
Put this shirt on I bought you.

178
00:16:04,865 --> 00:16:06,800
We gotta get out of here.

179
00:16:24,751 --> 00:16:26,386
Baby?

180
00:16:26,419 --> 00:16:27,854
Yeah?

181
00:16:27,888 --> 00:16:30,390
I think that maybe
we should go to a motel.

182
00:16:30,423 --> 00:16:32,726
Just so we can get off the road.

183
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:34,560
'Cause if that guy
called the cops

184
00:16:34,594 --> 00:16:36,797
maybe they wouldn't be looking
for US there, you know?

185
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:40,300
We can't go to a hotel.
We've got too much to do.

186
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:42,769
We've got to get to
Terry's bar by sunset.

187
00:16:44,605 --> 00:16:47,741
I don't want to
go to Terry's bar.

188
00:16:47,774 --> 00:16:51,678
I just want to lie down
in a bed with you.

189
00:16:51,712 --> 00:16:55,581
I just want to go to a motel
and sleep with you.

190
00:16:55,616 --> 00:16:57,751
Did you put the shirt on?

191
00:16:57,784 --> 00:17:00,420
Yeah.

192
00:17:00,453 --> 00:17:03,389
We can't go to a motel, hon.

193
00:17:51,337 --> 00:17:53,273
What are you doing?

194
00:17:55,508 --> 00:17:57,443
I need to get this out.

195
00:17:59,512 --> 00:18:01,948
Do you want help?

196
00:18:01,982 --> 00:18:03,917
Yeah.

197
00:18:16,362 --> 00:18:18,665
Why are you doing that?

198
00:18:18,699 --> 00:18:21,935
I have to get all the blood out.

199
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:26,372
Help me.

200
00:18:52,565 --> 00:18:54,500
[Gasping]

201
00:21:21,715 --> 00:21:24,651
Aww... [coughing]

202
00:21:48,909 --> 00:21:50,844
I love you.

203
00:22:05,091 --> 00:22:07,560
Do you think your
plan is gonna to work?

204
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:11,564
I do.

205
00:22:11,597 --> 00:22:13,533
I think your plan is gonna work.

206
00:22:14,768 --> 00:22:16,569
I'm not good at making plans.

207
00:22:16,603 --> 00:22:19,072
I am better at being
spontaneous and stuff.

208
00:22:19,105 --> 00:22:22,208
I think that's part of why
we're so good together.

209
00:22:22,242 --> 00:22:24,577
I need to know what
you told your mom

210
00:22:24,611 --> 00:22:28,081
when you dropped Marla off.

211
00:22:28,114 --> 00:22:30,751
I told her that Greg and I
needed some time alone,

212
00:22:30,784 --> 00:22:32,218
like a vacation.

213
00:22:32,252 --> 00:22:34,220
Where did you tell
her you were going?

214
00:22:34,254 --> 00:22:36,757
I told her I didn't know yet.

215
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:40,727
But I told her that people were after him,
like you said to say.

216
00:22:42,796 --> 00:22:45,732
You called her when
we were at the store?

217
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:51,805
No.

218
00:22:54,808 --> 00:22:57,177
I thought about it.

219
00:22:57,210 --> 00:23:00,080
I just missed her
little voice so much,

220
00:23:00,113 --> 00:23:03,083
and I picked up the phone...

221
00:23:03,116 --> 00:23:05,085
But I changed my mind,

222
00:23:05,118 --> 00:23:08,088
because I knew that you
really didn't want me to.

223
00:23:08,121 --> 00:23:11,257
And I knew that you were right.

224
00:23:11,291 --> 00:23:14,227
It's not that
I don't want you to.

225
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:18,031
It's just that we gotta
be smart right now.

226
00:23:20,166 --> 00:23:22,002
I know.

227
00:23:25,005 --> 00:23:27,641
[Crystal] When we build
our house in Mexico

228
00:23:27,674 --> 00:23:30,310
or north Carolina,
like you wanted.

229
00:23:30,343 --> 00:23:32,679
Near your mom's.

230
00:23:32,713 --> 00:23:36,582
I was thinking that maybe
you could plan the whole thing

231
00:23:36,617 --> 00:23:38,251
and you could build it,

232
00:23:38,284 --> 00:23:41,087
but I could be in charge
of decorating it.

233
00:23:41,121 --> 00:23:44,758
And everything will be
nice and clean,

234
00:23:44,791 --> 00:23:48,094
and there will be tile and
everything and nice white walls,

235
00:23:48,128 --> 00:23:50,330
and I'll keep it clean,
everyday, with bleach,

236
00:23:50,363 --> 00:23:52,332
if you wanted me to.

237
00:23:52,365 --> 00:23:55,035
And then I was thinking
that you could have some room

238
00:23:55,068 --> 00:23:57,871
in the backyard for all
of your tools and things.

239
00:23:57,904 --> 00:24:00,340
And you could do everything
that you like to do back there.

240
00:24:00,373 --> 00:24:02,976
But then I could have a special
room for Marla and myself

241
00:24:03,009 --> 00:24:06,146
to do what we like to do,
and to decorate it with,

242
00:24:06,179 --> 00:24:08,148
you know, things that she likes.

243
00:24:08,181 --> 00:24:11,985
Like, baby dolls and mermaids
and Princess things.

244
00:24:12,018 --> 00:24:15,822
And then, also, she's really into
dinosaurs right now for some reason.

245
00:24:15,856 --> 00:24:18,324
I don't get it. I don't know.

246
00:24:18,358 --> 00:24:20,727
I guess they're doing some
lesson at school or something.

247
00:24:23,363 --> 00:24:25,699
I mean, she can come later.

248
00:24:25,732 --> 00:24:28,201
Once everything is safe.

249
00:24:28,234 --> 00:24:30,671
She's better with
your mom right now.

250
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:49,723
I want to go on a boat with you,

251
00:24:49,756 --> 00:24:52,358
or an airplane.

252
00:24:56,730 --> 00:25:00,033
We've never been grocery shopping together,
that'd be nice.

253
00:25:02,736 --> 00:25:06,072
What made you think of that?

254
00:25:06,106 --> 00:25:08,041
Boats.

255
00:25:18,785 --> 00:25:21,722
That made you think
about grocery shopping?

256
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:25,659
No. I just thought
of that on my own.

257
00:25:36,436 --> 00:25:39,139
We should probably stop and
get Terry a nice bottle of wine.

258
00:25:39,172 --> 00:25:41,274
Why?

259
00:25:41,307 --> 00:25:43,409
I don't know.

260
00:25:43,443 --> 00:25:45,411
Isn't it normal
when you go somewhere

261
00:25:45,445 --> 00:25:47,914
to show up with a
nice bottle of wine?

262
00:25:56,990 --> 00:25:59,125
[Crystal] Starfish motel.

263
00:25:59,159 --> 00:26:01,361
Buccaneer's way.

264
00:26:01,394 --> 00:26:04,030
Pirate's cove.

265
00:26:04,064 --> 00:26:07,033
Weeki wachee.
You ever been there?

266
00:26:07,067 --> 00:26:08,769
No.

267
00:26:08,802 --> 00:26:11,437
My mom took me there once
when I was little.

268
00:26:11,471 --> 00:26:14,216
We couldn't afford to get in the front,
so we snuck around this back entrance.

269
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,878
And then we went on this boat,
I remember, and there was, like,

270
00:26:17,911 --> 00:26:21,414
an underwater show that we went to in this
big place, and there were all these mermaids

271
00:26:21,447 --> 00:26:25,118
swimming around under water. It was... I
don't know, it was just a really fun place.

272
00:26:25,151 --> 00:26:28,254
I always told Marla that
I was going to take her there,

273
00:26:28,288 --> 00:26:31,424
but I can't afford that, so...

274
00:26:31,457 --> 00:26:35,195
I don't know, maybe someday we'll sneak
around back again, something like that.

275
00:26:35,228 --> 00:26:38,064
Do you think that we could
maybe go there on the way back?

276
00:26:38,098 --> 00:26:39,966
No.

277
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,160
Did you know that mermaids
live forever? No they don't.

278
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:47,107
The sand dollar.

279
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:49,876
Briny deep.

280
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:52,478
Beachcomber.

281
00:26:52,512 --> 00:26:53,980
Coconut inn.

282
00:26:54,014 --> 00:26:55,816
Tropical shores.

283
00:26:55,849 --> 00:26:57,984
Crystal,
will you please stop reading all the signs?

284
00:26:58,018 --> 00:26:59,786
I have a really
bad headache. I'm sorry.

285
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:02,155
Crystal palms.

286
00:27:02,188 --> 00:27:04,090
Crystal palms!

287
00:27:04,124 --> 00:27:06,927
That's nice for you.

288
00:27:23,143 --> 00:27:25,979
Shit. That cop's
been following US.

289
00:27:26,012 --> 00:27:28,882
Crystal, do not look back.

290
00:27:28,915 --> 00:27:31,417
Look straight ahead, okay?

291
00:27:33,887 --> 00:27:36,356
What should we do?

292
00:27:36,389 --> 00:27:38,024
Just relax, okay?

293
00:27:41,294 --> 00:27:44,831
Crystal, if he pulls US over,

294
00:27:44,865 --> 00:27:47,500
will you please just act normal?

295
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:53,039
Maybe we could drive off
down an alleyway and...

296
00:27:53,073 --> 00:27:55,575
What are you doing?! Don't
open that thing! I'm sorry.

297
00:27:55,609 --> 00:27:58,511
That's a terrible idea. Not going
down an alley and using that gun!

298
00:27:58,544 --> 00:28:01,547
All right, we're just gonna calm down,
and if he pulls US over,

299
00:28:01,581 --> 00:28:03,984
we're going to relax and act
like nothing is wrong, okay?

300
00:28:04,017 --> 00:28:06,352
There's nothing wrong.
There's nothing in the trunk.

301
00:28:06,386 --> 00:28:07,854
Just relax.

302
00:28:28,609 --> 00:28:30,576
Oh, shit...

303
00:28:30,611 --> 00:28:32,913
He didn't follow US.

304
00:28:32,946 --> 00:28:36,316
I thought that was gonna
be the last time I saw you.

305
00:28:36,349 --> 00:28:38,284
It's okay.

306
00:28:38,318 --> 00:28:40,453
He's gone now.

307
00:28:40,486 --> 00:28:43,123
It's okay, it's okay,
just relax.

308
00:28:43,156 --> 00:28:45,935
Let's be good together. Let's be
good to one another from now on, okay?

309
00:28:45,959 --> 00:28:47,560
Okay.

310
00:28:50,496 --> 00:28:52,132
Crystal, relax.

311
00:28:52,165 --> 00:28:54,067
Crystal,
you don't need to do that right now.

312
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:55,936
Get up off
my pants.Okay.

313
00:29:05,245 --> 00:29:08,849
See, Terry's house
is right there. See it?

314
00:29:13,654 --> 00:29:17,891
That's good,
'cause that's even closer than I thought.

315
00:29:17,924 --> 00:29:19,860
It's closer than I remember.

316
00:29:37,277 --> 00:29:40,080
Fuck! The door
is jammed again.

317
00:29:40,113 --> 00:29:42,883
Will you come out and get me?

318
00:30:44,745 --> 00:30:46,680
I'm sorry.

319
00:30:55,121 --> 00:30:57,691
Crystal, come on. Come help.

320
00:30:59,259 --> 00:31:01,227
Try to do this quickly.

321
00:31:01,261 --> 00:31:03,229
I don't know how
to build a tent.

322
00:31:03,263 --> 00:31:05,165
It's not building a tent,

323
00:31:05,198 --> 00:31:07,668
it's just popping
it up, all right?

324
00:31:07,701 --> 00:31:10,503
And let's try to be a little careful
about how we deal with this.

325
00:31:10,536 --> 00:31:12,338
If we don't fuck it up too bad,

326
00:31:12,372 --> 00:31:14,641
we might be able
to take it back.

327
00:31:18,311 --> 00:31:20,246
See, it's set up.

328
00:31:24,317 --> 00:31:26,252
Grab that.

329
00:31:27,654 --> 00:31:30,090
We need to put the stakes in.

330
00:33:32,913 --> 00:33:34,848
Come on.

331
00:33:57,470 --> 00:34:01,407
[Chimes tinkling]

332
00:34:28,969 --> 00:34:31,605
It smells like smoke.

333
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,648
That's disgusting.

334
00:34:51,591 --> 00:34:54,227
So you built these
cabinets for her?

335
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:56,229
Yeah.

336
00:34:56,262 --> 00:34:58,398
Then what happened?

337
00:34:58,431 --> 00:35:00,400
That was it.

338
00:35:00,433 --> 00:35:03,870
You can tell me.
I'm not going to get mad at you.

339
00:35:07,373 --> 00:35:10,510
What else do you want to know?
I built her cabinets.

340
00:35:10,543 --> 00:35:12,512
I went into her bar,

341
00:35:12,545 --> 00:35:14,347
we got to talking.

342
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:17,751
I was at a job, just down the beach,
and she said...

343
00:35:17,784 --> 00:35:21,287
Asked what I was doing,
I told her I just did

344
00:35:21,321 --> 00:35:23,023
some construction.

345
00:35:23,056 --> 00:35:26,026
She said if I could build cabinets for her,
and I told her no sweat.

346
00:35:26,059 --> 00:35:28,729
So you met her
the same way you met me?

347
00:35:28,762 --> 00:35:30,731
You didn't tell me that.

348
00:35:30,764 --> 00:35:32,733
'Cause you met me when you were

349
00:35:32,766 --> 00:35:35,401
working a job nearby
the bar where I work,

350
00:35:35,435 --> 00:35:37,738
and then you built
cabinets for me and Greg,

351
00:35:37,771 --> 00:35:39,740
so, that's the same.

352
00:35:39,773 --> 00:35:41,574
No, that's different.

353
00:35:41,608 --> 00:35:43,576
How's that different?

354
00:35:43,610 --> 00:35:47,047
All right, I think you should
stop giving her a hard time.

355
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:49,415
She's our alibi here.

356
00:35:49,449 --> 00:35:52,418
All right? You're
in Jacksonville.

357
00:35:52,452 --> 00:35:56,757
And I'm here alone with her,
and neither of US

358
00:35:56,790 --> 00:36:02,663
are in the everglades dumping
your husband into the swamp.

359
00:36:02,696 --> 00:36:04,998
Will you change out
of those clothes,

360
00:36:05,031 --> 00:36:07,033
and see if she's got
anything else that fits you?

361
00:36:07,067 --> 00:36:09,703
You really shouldn't be walking
around in those clothes.

362
00:36:09,736 --> 00:36:11,672
Does that make sense?

363
00:36:31,091 --> 00:36:32,693
Stupid.

364
00:37:14,835 --> 00:37:16,637
What are you doing?

365
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:18,972
I was just trying to find
something that fits.

366
00:37:19,005 --> 00:37:20,774
Take that off.

367
00:37:23,143 --> 00:37:24,978
You want me to take it off?

368
00:37:25,011 --> 00:37:26,947
Yes.

369
00:37:31,685 --> 00:37:34,655
She ever wear this for you?

370
00:37:34,688 --> 00:37:36,489
No.

371
00:37:36,522 --> 00:37:38,091
That's too bad.

372
00:37:42,863 --> 00:37:44,831
What did she wear for you?

373
00:37:44,865 --> 00:37:47,000
Nothing. nothing?

374
00:37:47,033 --> 00:37:50,503
No, she just wore
normal clothes.

375
00:37:50,536 --> 00:37:52,505
Oh...

376
00:37:52,538 --> 00:37:54,507
Did you have fun with her?

377
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:56,509
No, I didn't.

378
00:37:56,542 --> 00:37:59,646
That's too bad too.

379
00:38:39,853 --> 00:38:41,622
Ow!

380
00:39:11,117 --> 00:39:13,053
You okay?

381
00:39:14,788 --> 00:39:17,190
He wanted to make love to me.

382
00:39:19,793 --> 00:39:23,096
That's how it started,
because...

383
00:39:23,129 --> 00:39:26,099
He wanted to make love to me,
and I told him I didn't want to,

384
00:39:26,132 --> 00:39:28,769
because I only wanted
to make love to you.

385
00:39:28,802 --> 00:39:32,105
So he beat me.

386
00:39:32,138 --> 00:39:34,941
He beat you for
a lot of reasons.

387
00:39:34,975 --> 00:39:36,977
He knew I was cheating on him.

388
00:39:41,147 --> 00:39:43,083
Did he tell anyone?

389
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:49,790
There weren't any marks on me
or bruises or anything,

390
00:39:49,823 --> 00:39:52,092
but it hurt really bad.

391
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:56,262
And I wanted there
to be bruises,

392
00:39:56,296 --> 00:40:01,101
because I wanted there to be
proof that it had happened.

393
00:40:04,004 --> 00:40:07,674
'Cause I'd been lying
so long to myself...

394
00:40:07,708 --> 00:40:10,276
Crystal, if he told anyone,
they're going to be coming for me.

395
00:40:10,310 --> 00:40:13,546
I just wanted to know
that it was as bad

396
00:40:13,579 --> 00:40:16,082
as I was telling myself it was.

397
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,288
The first time I stabbed him,

398
00:40:22,322 --> 00:40:23,990
he opened his eyes

399
00:40:24,024 --> 00:40:26,126
and he looked right at me,

400
00:40:26,159 --> 00:40:28,895
and I was so sad

401
00:40:28,929 --> 00:40:30,864
and so scared.

402
00:40:33,867 --> 00:40:38,171
But I kept going,
because I knew I couldn't stop.

403
00:40:38,204 --> 00:40:41,107
I just needed him
to stop strangling me.

404
00:40:44,077 --> 00:40:45,712
You didn't tell me he knew!

405
00:40:45,746 --> 00:40:49,049
He didn't know for sure.
He didn't know for sure.

406
00:40:49,082 --> 00:40:51,051
He was always
saying shit like that.

407
00:40:51,084 --> 00:40:53,353
You just said he knew
you were cheating.

408
00:40:53,386 --> 00:40:55,889
No, I know I said
he knew I was cheating,

409
00:40:55,922 --> 00:40:58,224
but he always said that
he thought I was cheating.

410
00:40:58,258 --> 00:41:00,226
It didn't mean
that he knew for sure.

411
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:02,062
What the fuck did
he say crystal?!

412
00:41:02,095 --> 00:41:03,906
He said he thought I was
fucking somebody else,

413
00:41:03,930 --> 00:41:05,365
but that doesn't mean anything.

414
00:41:05,398 --> 00:41:07,233
He was always
saying shit like that,

415
00:41:07,267 --> 00:41:09,235
he was always saying
I was fucking somebody else.

416
00:41:09,269 --> 00:41:11,237
He was crazy.
It didn't mean that he knew.

417
00:41:11,271 --> 00:41:13,373
I didn't mean
that he knew for sure.

418
00:41:13,406 --> 00:41:16,342
I just meant that he was
saying stuff like that.

419
00:41:21,347 --> 00:41:23,617
Please don't leave me.

420
00:41:26,252 --> 00:41:28,221
Is your hand okay?

421
00:41:28,254 --> 00:41:30,190
It's okay.

422
00:41:35,095 --> 00:41:38,031
You really shouldn't be
here with me right now.

423
00:41:41,401 --> 00:41:45,338
Let's just find a bar
or something to go to.

424
00:41:47,407 --> 00:41:50,243
Just put something
else on and let's go.

425
00:41:50,276 --> 00:41:52,045
Quick.

426
00:43:17,197 --> 00:43:21,134
[♪♪]

427
00:43:48,228 --> 00:43:52,032
I was just thinking about
the last time I got into a fight.

428
00:43:52,065 --> 00:43:55,001
I don't think I ever
told you about it.

429
00:43:58,538 --> 00:44:01,207
You know how people
think i'm stupid sometimes,

430
00:44:01,241 --> 00:44:03,877
because I'm quiet
and I don't talk a lot?

431
00:44:03,910 --> 00:44:05,511
Yeah.

432
00:44:05,545 --> 00:44:07,513
Well, um...

433
00:44:07,547 --> 00:44:10,516
You know that woman charlene
that works at the bar with me?

434
00:44:10,550 --> 00:44:14,387
She's kind of tall, she's got a
gap between her two front teeth.

435
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:17,891
Well, I bought this lipstick,

436
00:44:17,924 --> 00:44:20,393
this was, like,
last year sometime.

437
00:44:20,426 --> 00:44:22,929
I came in wearing it and she
said that she liked the color.

438
00:44:22,963 --> 00:44:25,265
So, I told her that she
could borrow it if she wanted,

439
00:44:25,298 --> 00:44:27,567
and she went into the
bathroom and she tried it on,

440
00:44:27,601 --> 00:44:30,436
and she came out wearing it,
but she never gave it back to me.

441
00:44:30,470 --> 00:44:33,940
And so, it was busy and I just
figured that maybe she would

442
00:44:33,974 --> 00:44:36,442
maybe give it back to me later,
but she never did.

443
00:44:36,476 --> 00:44:39,112
And then, like, everyday,
for something like three weeks,

444
00:44:39,145 --> 00:44:41,581
she'd come in wearing
this stupid color.

445
00:44:41,615 --> 00:44:44,217
And I just wasn't
saying anything and

446
00:44:44,250 --> 00:44:46,552
I guess she probably
thought I forgot,

447
00:44:46,586 --> 00:44:49,355
because everyone thinks
I'm so distracted all the time,

448
00:44:49,389 --> 00:44:51,992
but...

449
00:44:56,296 --> 00:44:59,565
So, finally,
one day I had gotten into a fluster...

450
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:02,535
I was just in a really bad
mood before I went to work.

451
00:45:02,568 --> 00:45:04,304
I was so pissed off.

452
00:45:04,337 --> 00:45:06,306
And I came in and she
was wearing the lipstick

453
00:45:06,339 --> 00:45:08,141
and so, I said to her,

454
00:45:08,174 --> 00:45:10,243
"charlene,
can you give me that lipstick back?

455
00:45:10,276 --> 00:45:12,245
You've had it for
three weeks now."

456
00:45:12,278 --> 00:45:14,615
And she was said she didn't
know what I was talking about,

457
00:45:14,648 --> 00:45:16,617
and tried to pretend
that it was hers.

458
00:45:16,650 --> 00:45:18,619
Can I have a whiskey?

459
00:45:18,652 --> 00:45:20,586
Another whiskey for you?

460
00:45:23,624 --> 00:45:26,126
I told her that she was a liar,

461
00:45:26,159 --> 00:45:28,962
and then she called me a bitch.

462
00:45:28,995 --> 00:45:30,964
And I don't know
what got into me,

463
00:45:30,997 --> 00:45:33,466
but I told her that she was a bitch,
I told her right back.

464
00:45:33,499 --> 00:45:35,435
And then she said that I was...

465
00:45:35,468 --> 00:45:37,303
Just keep that.

466
00:45:37,337 --> 00:45:39,606
For some reason,
she told me that I was a bad mother,

467
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:42,242
and that just drove
me over the edge

468
00:45:42,275 --> 00:45:44,577
and I slapped her in the face.

469
00:45:44,611 --> 00:45:47,080
And so we were rolling
around on the ground,

470
00:45:47,113 --> 00:45:49,249
and I was getting my
ass whooped because

471
00:45:49,282 --> 00:45:52,252
it turned out that she was a
pretty good fighter, actually.

472
00:45:52,285 --> 00:45:53,920
And then, my boss...

473
00:45:53,954 --> 00:45:55,922
Thank you. Keep it.

474
00:45:55,956 --> 00:45:58,258
Had to drag US off one another.

475
00:45:58,291 --> 00:46:01,928
And it turned out that
neither one of US got fired,

476
00:46:01,962 --> 00:46:04,931
for some reason,
so we still work together,

477
00:46:04,965 --> 00:46:06,933
and we get along fine.

478
00:46:06,967 --> 00:46:09,102
It's a pretty funny
story, I guess.

479
00:46:09,135 --> 00:46:11,071
It's not a funny story.

480
00:46:22,949 --> 00:46:27,553
♪ Like I was made of stone

481
00:46:27,587 --> 00:46:31,557

484
00:46:40,701 --> 00:46:44,337
Hey, what's a guy like
you doing in a bar like this?

485
00:47:02,588 --> 00:47:04,691
Say, you're pretty cute.

486
00:47:04,725 --> 00:47:07,027
Will you quit following
me for a second?

487
00:47:10,263 --> 00:47:11,698
You know, my mama

488
00:47:11,732 --> 00:47:14,234
always told me never
to talk to strangers,

489
00:47:14,267 --> 00:47:16,569
but I never really
listened to her anyway.

490
00:47:16,603 --> 00:47:19,039
You seem pretty nice.

491
00:47:34,287 --> 00:47:37,257
You know,
you can buy me a drink if you want to,

492
00:47:37,290 --> 00:47:39,259
but I have to be
honest with you.

493
00:47:39,292 --> 00:47:41,561
I'm totally in love
with somebody else.

494
00:47:43,463 --> 00:47:46,266
But he and I get into
fights all the time,

495
00:47:46,299 --> 00:47:48,201
because he's always pretending

496
00:47:48,234 --> 00:47:50,136
that he knows what
he's talking about,

497
00:47:50,170 --> 00:47:52,138
when really...

498
00:47:52,172 --> 00:47:54,140
I don't think he
really knows shit all

499
00:47:54,174 --> 00:47:56,777
about what he's talking about.

500
00:47:56,810 --> 00:47:59,145
But I love him,
I really love him.

501
00:47:59,179 --> 00:48:01,782
I think he's the only person in
the world that understands me.

502
00:48:01,815 --> 00:48:04,150
I know what I'm talking about.

503
00:48:04,184 --> 00:48:06,452
You do?

504
00:48:08,722 --> 00:48:12,492
I don't think you know
shit about some things.

505
00:48:14,761 --> 00:48:17,397
You understand me?

506
00:48:17,430 --> 00:48:19,365
I think so.

507
00:48:36,817 --> 00:48:40,486
You know what I like about you,
crys?

508
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:43,323
You make it so I don't have
to think about what to say.

509
00:48:43,356 --> 00:48:45,158
I don't even think

510
00:48:45,191 --> 00:48:46,660
too much about it.

511
00:48:46,693 --> 00:48:50,163
You just...
Get me talking.

512
00:48:50,196 --> 00:48:52,666
I think it's because
you ask questions

513
00:48:52,699 --> 00:48:55,501
about how I used to be,

514
00:48:55,535 --> 00:48:57,638
my interests.

515
00:49:01,207 --> 00:49:03,677
It's hard to get to talking,

516
00:49:03,710 --> 00:49:05,779
the way you make me talk.

517
00:49:30,871 --> 00:49:33,339
Did you ever have
a swimming pool?

518
00:49:34,708 --> 00:49:36,509
No.

519
00:49:36,542 --> 00:49:38,311
Yeah, me neither.

520
00:49:41,414 --> 00:49:44,651
When I was real little,
I remember my cousin.

521
00:49:44,685 --> 00:49:47,153
She used to be able
to go into the pool

522
00:49:47,187 --> 00:49:50,323
and hold her breath
for something like two minutes.

523
00:49:50,356 --> 00:49:52,325
I know that sounds crazy,
it doesn't

524
00:49:52,358 --> 00:49:55,361
seem like it's possible,
but now that

525
00:49:55,395 --> 00:49:58,140
I think about it, that's just one of
those things you have in your head...

526
00:49:58,164 --> 00:50:00,166
[Man] I can do just
about anything.

527
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:03,770
I'll run your electric, run your plumbing,
lay down your concrete.

528
00:50:03,804 --> 00:50:05,772
Build your roof, your walls,
your whole house.

529
00:50:06,907 --> 00:50:09,843
This one guy, I raised his roof

530
00:50:09,876 --> 00:50:12,846
up about four feet.

531
00:50:12,879 --> 00:50:16,416
Said his price is going to go up to
priceless if you get these up a little bit.

532
00:50:16,449 --> 00:50:20,253
At the end of the day,
those ceilings were up 15 feet,

533
00:50:20,286 --> 00:50:24,224
and that man was talking
about how I took too long.

534
00:50:24,257 --> 00:50:28,561
Well, maybe I did
take too long, but...

535
00:50:28,594 --> 00:50:30,731
[Crystal] I just wanted
to go swimming.

536
00:50:30,764 --> 00:50:32,699
[Man] I always loved building.

537
00:50:33,934 --> 00:50:36,903
I'd always find a piece of wood.

538
00:50:36,937 --> 00:50:39,405
Look for another piece of wood.

539
00:50:39,439 --> 00:50:42,408
Start putting
those things together.

540
00:50:45,245 --> 00:50:48,682
Build a fort...
Build a fort for my friends.

541
00:50:48,715 --> 00:50:50,516
We'd go up there,

542
00:50:50,550 --> 00:50:54,254
not say much, but at least we
were out of the sight of my mom.

543
00:50:54,287 --> 00:50:57,691
[Crystal] I know that I
haven't been easy to be around,

544
00:50:57,724 --> 00:51:00,526
and I feel really
bad about it, because...

545
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:02,696
I think you're so good.

546
00:51:02,729 --> 00:51:04,865
I think you're so kind.

547
00:51:04,898 --> 00:51:07,701
I wish that you didn't have
to deal with anything bad.

548
00:51:26,987 --> 00:51:28,955
All right.

549
00:51:28,989 --> 00:51:33,493
Okay, if you need to go to
the bathroom or anything...

550
00:51:33,526 --> 00:51:36,329
Will you come in
and sleep with me?

551
00:51:36,362 --> 00:51:38,665
Honey, I can't. I'm so sorry,
but I can't.

552
00:51:38,699 --> 00:51:40,333
Can you give me a kiss?

553
00:51:40,366 --> 00:51:42,502
I'll give you a kiss,
but I have to get going.

554
00:51:42,535 --> 00:51:44,504
I'm so sorry. Give me
another kiss?

555
00:51:44,537 --> 00:51:46,506
Just a quick one.

556
00:51:46,539 --> 00:51:48,975
Will you slide in
there? I'm so sorry.

557
00:51:49,009 --> 00:51:50,844
I will be back in three hours.

558
00:51:50,877 --> 00:51:53,346
I hope she's gonna
be home. I'm so sorry.

559
00:51:53,379 --> 00:51:56,416
She's on her way home. She's
going to be home very soon.

560
00:51:56,449 --> 00:51:59,385
I'll be back in three
hours. I'm so sorry.

561
00:52:51,071 --> 00:52:52,873
[Woman] Hello?

562
00:53:00,947 --> 00:53:02,749
Hey.

563
00:53:02,783 --> 00:53:06,753
Aw, somebody's been
sleeping in my bed.

564
00:53:06,787 --> 00:53:09,489
Yeah, I was
sleeping in your bed.

565
00:53:09,522 --> 00:53:11,792
You want a drink?
I need a drink.

566
00:53:11,825 --> 00:53:16,562
Fucking bar fight broke out in
there just as I was kicking people out.

567
00:53:20,066 --> 00:53:23,369
Oh, jeez.

568
00:53:23,403 --> 00:53:25,939
Sorry about the mess in here.

569
00:53:25,972 --> 00:53:28,775
I just wanted
a little pizza, you know?

570
00:53:28,809 --> 00:53:31,077
I passed out and
nearly killed myself.

571
00:53:31,111 --> 00:53:33,079
The place was filled with smoke.

572
00:53:33,113 --> 00:53:35,081
It's that stupid doctor.

573
00:53:35,115 --> 00:53:37,784
He gave me some sinus
medication or something.

574
00:53:37,818 --> 00:53:41,054
It didn't mix with the
glass of wine. Not my fault.

575
00:53:46,492 --> 00:53:49,029
There you go, baby bear.

576
00:54:06,146 --> 00:54:08,982
I got something for you.
I got a present for you.

577
00:54:09,015 --> 00:54:10,951
It's in my car though.

578
00:54:43,717 --> 00:54:46,019
Did you change your clothes?

579
00:54:46,052 --> 00:54:48,655
Yeah, just getting comfortable.

580
00:54:52,726 --> 00:54:56,062
Okay. What is it?

581
00:54:56,096 --> 00:54:58,865
It's a mermaid
sitting in a shell.

582
00:55:01,201 --> 00:55:04,004
Aw, she's so sweet.

583
00:55:07,540 --> 00:55:10,977
Thank you, Leo.
That's so sweet.

584
00:55:16,983 --> 00:55:18,952
Can I get through here?

585
00:55:18,985 --> 00:55:21,521
I just need to use the
restroom. Just one second.

586
00:55:24,224 --> 00:55:26,559
[Whispering] What the fuck?

587
00:55:37,237 --> 00:55:39,906
You need any help in there?

588
00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:42,175
No.

589
00:55:55,255 --> 00:55:58,224
[Leo] You want to watch
some TV or something?

590
00:55:58,258 --> 00:56:01,561
[Terry] No, I don't want to
watch some TV or something.

591
00:56:11,271 --> 00:56:13,740
So why'd you come here?

592
00:56:15,976 --> 00:56:18,779
Just wanted to say hi.

593
00:56:18,812 --> 00:56:20,881
Had a couple of days off.

594
00:56:24,284 --> 00:56:26,620
So you just wanted to say hi.

595
00:56:26,653 --> 00:56:30,256
Drove four hours,
came to see me?

596
00:56:30,290 --> 00:56:32,092
Yeah.

597
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:48,609
Are you playing games with me?

598
00:56:48,642 --> 00:56:50,276
Because if you are,

599
00:56:50,310 --> 00:56:52,879
I do not need that shit.

600
00:56:52,913 --> 00:56:57,283
Why are you acting
so fucking weird?

601
00:56:57,317 --> 00:57:01,822
[Leo] All right, I'm just... I've
been trying to quit smoking.

602
00:57:01,855 --> 00:57:04,157
That's all.

603
00:57:04,190 --> 00:57:06,159
I'm sorry I am acting so weird.

604
00:57:06,192 --> 00:57:08,128
It's not easy.

605
00:57:11,865 --> 00:57:14,735
So you just wanted to see me?

606
00:57:19,873 --> 00:57:21,642
Yeah.

607
00:57:24,210 --> 00:57:27,013
Okay.

608
00:57:27,047 --> 00:57:29,983
You want to see
a little more of me?

609
00:57:57,811 --> 00:57:59,746
[Banging window]

610
00:58:04,384 --> 00:58:08,321
[Banging and clattering]

611
00:58:10,657 --> 00:58:14,394
[Crystal shrieking and yelling]

612
00:58:14,427 --> 00:58:18,231
Get the fuck off me, Leo!

613
00:58:18,264 --> 00:58:21,367
Calm down! I'll explain
this in the car. Calm down.

614
00:58:21,401 --> 00:58:24,370
You gave her
the fucking mermaid?!

615
00:58:24,404 --> 00:58:26,239
[Terry] I'm calling the cops!

616
00:58:26,272 --> 00:58:28,374
Get the fuck out of here!

617
00:58:28,408 --> 00:58:30,648
[Leo] I didn't think this was
going to happen. I'm sorry.

618
00:58:30,677 --> 00:58:32,679
I'm sorry. I didn't think
this was going to happen.

619
00:58:32,713 --> 00:58:35,682
Under other circumstances, I could
have had a nice time with you, okay?

620
00:58:35,716 --> 00:58:38,051
And I have in the past,
but I can't anymore.

621
00:58:38,084 --> 00:58:40,854
I told you I didn't
want to come here.

622
00:58:40,887 --> 00:58:44,157
I said I don't want to come here and
you told me that we had to come here.

623
00:58:44,190 --> 00:58:46,402
I told you I didn't want to come here and you
told me you build fucking cabinets for her.

624
00:58:46,426 --> 00:58:48,094
You told me you built
cabinets for her!

625
00:58:48,128 --> 00:58:50,931
I hate you both so much.
I hate you both so fucking much!

626
00:58:50,964 --> 00:58:52,866
I told you I didn't
want to come here!

627
00:58:52,899 --> 00:58:55,035
I told you I didn't want
to come here! Drop the knife.

628
00:58:55,068 --> 00:58:58,404
I told you not to bring me here. And
you said you didn't... you lied to me!

629
00:58:58,438 --> 00:59:00,974
You fucking lied...

630
00:59:01,007 --> 00:59:02,408
Stop!

631
00:59:02,442 --> 00:59:04,377
[Slapping]

632
00:59:06,079 --> 00:59:07,447
We're gonna leave.

633
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:09,449
All right, we're gonna leave.

634
00:59:09,482 --> 00:59:11,752
I just need to figure out
a couple things, okay?

635
00:59:11,785 --> 00:59:13,319
I'm gonna step outside
for a minute.

636
00:59:13,353 --> 00:59:17,323
Okay, okay...
I'm not going to hurt you.

637
00:59:17,357 --> 00:59:20,426
That's not what this is about. I'm
going to try not to hurt you, okay?

638
00:59:40,413 --> 00:59:43,216
I never thought
I'd be in this situation.

639
00:59:43,249 --> 00:59:46,219
So I have no idea what to do.

640
00:59:46,252 --> 00:59:51,157
I'm not asking for advice,
I just...

641
00:59:51,191 --> 00:59:54,995
It's a good thing I don't
know how to do this, right?

642
00:59:55,028 --> 00:59:56,797
I don't know what you're doing.

643
00:59:56,830 --> 00:59:59,132
I know you don't.

644
00:59:59,165 --> 01:00:02,969
Okay, right, so...

645
01:00:03,003 --> 01:00:06,439
Okay, so, crystal...

646
01:00:10,110 --> 01:00:11,912
We're in a bad position, okay?

647
01:00:11,945 --> 01:00:14,915
Once we leave,
will you not call the cops?

648
01:00:14,948 --> 01:00:17,383
I know you're probably
going to want to call the cops.

649
01:00:20,887 --> 01:00:22,823
Please don't call the cops.

650
01:00:27,060 --> 01:00:30,030
We need a boat.

651
01:00:30,063 --> 01:00:32,032
We're not going to
make it to the everglades,

652
01:00:32,065 --> 01:00:34,334
we probably
wouldn't have either way.

653
01:00:41,274 --> 01:00:43,376
I'm sorry I lied.
I didn't get this for you.

654
01:00:43,409 --> 01:00:45,478
[Terry] Just get out!

655
01:00:56,556 --> 01:00:58,524
Get in the car.

656
01:00:58,558 --> 01:01:00,493
I heard scratching.

657
01:01:18,478 --> 01:01:20,280
I heard scratching.

658
01:01:20,313 --> 01:01:22,082
You didn't hear scratching.

659
01:01:22,115 --> 01:01:24,350
He's dead.
He's very dead.

660
01:01:24,384 --> 01:01:26,519
I know he's dead,
but I heard scratching.

661
01:01:26,552 --> 01:01:28,521
Shut up! Do not talk.

662
01:01:28,554 --> 01:01:30,556
You can't be talking right now.

663
01:01:30,590 --> 01:01:33,960
I need to figure
this out. That's fine

664
01:01:33,994 --> 01:01:36,296
I hate you so much right now.

665
01:01:36,329 --> 01:01:38,832
Okay. I understand that.

666
01:01:38,865 --> 01:01:41,001
And yes, I've had sex with her.

667
01:01:41,034 --> 01:01:43,169
That's all I do
when I get there.

668
01:01:43,203 --> 01:01:46,006
She'd knew something was up
when I didn't go through with it.

669
01:01:46,039 --> 01:01:49,976
[Crystal imagines scratching
sounds over Leo's voice ]

670
01:02:15,636 --> 01:02:17,570
Get out.

671
01:02:21,642 --> 01:02:24,577
You wanted to
come here! Get out!

672
01:02:39,993 --> 01:02:42,262
Come on, come on, come on.

673
01:02:53,674 --> 01:02:55,541
Oh, shit.

674
01:03:34,715 --> 01:03:36,516
These your boats?

675
01:03:37,583 --> 01:03:39,185
Not open.

676
01:03:41,587 --> 01:03:44,390
I was hoping I could rent
one of these boats off of you.

677
01:03:44,424 --> 01:03:45,692
Not open.

678
01:03:45,726 --> 01:03:48,028
Well, what time y'all open?

679
01:03:53,433 --> 01:03:55,636
You need to go, please.

680
01:03:55,669 --> 01:03:58,138
Sir, I'm not trying
to cause any trouble.

681
01:03:58,171 --> 01:04:00,306
I just need to rent one
of these boats off you.

682
01:04:00,340 --> 01:04:04,144
Just going to go on
a little canoe trip.

683
01:04:04,177 --> 01:04:07,080
I've seen enough.

684
01:04:07,113 --> 01:04:10,516
You need to leave.
Now, please.

685
01:04:10,550 --> 01:04:12,252
Now.

686
01:06:24,250 --> 01:06:25,719
Fuck!

687
01:06:25,752 --> 01:06:27,387
God...

688
01:06:27,420 --> 01:06:29,856
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay.

689
01:06:29,890 --> 01:06:32,358
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck...

690
01:06:33,860 --> 01:06:37,831
It's okay. It's okay.

691
01:06:37,864 --> 01:06:40,834
[Woman] A lot of people forget that,
but we'll find a snake in their yard

692
01:06:40,867 --> 01:06:43,770
and they'll kick it out,
send it over to their neighbors.

693
01:06:43,804 --> 01:06:45,772
We really don't want to do that.

694
01:06:45,806 --> 01:06:48,709
They do help out greatly
with the rodent population,

695
01:06:48,742 --> 01:06:50,476
and diseases.

696
01:06:50,510 --> 01:06:52,578
So, at the same time you're
kicking out the snake,

697
01:06:52,613 --> 01:06:54,915
you'd only be inheriting
a lot more of those.

698
01:06:54,948 --> 01:06:57,183
So, you're definitely
better off...

699
01:06:57,217 --> 01:06:59,185
Fuck!

700
01:06:59,219 --> 01:07:01,855
I'm fucked, I'm fucked,
I'm fucked.

701
01:07:01,888 --> 01:07:04,557
It's okay. It's okay.

702
01:07:04,590 --> 01:07:06,727
Just calm down. Just calm down.

703
01:07:06,760 --> 01:07:08,561
It's okay.

704
01:07:08,594 --> 01:07:10,396
Oh, Jesus Christ.

705
01:07:10,430 --> 01:07:12,799
[Film narrator]
Imagine a place,

706
01:07:12,833 --> 01:07:16,637
serene, tranquil, and peaceful.

707
01:07:16,670 --> 01:07:19,405
A place of weightlessness.

708
01:07:19,439 --> 01:07:23,243
A world as old as time
and as new as a dream.

709
01:07:23,276 --> 01:07:27,547
Behold this beauty
as our story unfolds.

710
01:07:42,696 --> 01:07:44,965
Far out on our sea,

711
01:07:44,998 --> 01:07:48,268
the water is as blue
as the loveliest corn flower,

712
01:07:48,301 --> 01:07:50,570
and as pure
as the clearest glass.

713
01:07:52,973 --> 01:07:54,941
Do I gotta pay to get in there?

714
01:07:54,975 --> 01:07:56,943
I just gotta
go in there two seconds.

715
01:07:56,977 --> 01:07:58,645
Yes, for one.

716
01:07:58,679 --> 01:08:00,781
How much does it
cost?$13 dollars.

717
01:08:00,814 --> 01:08:03,784
How much? 13.

718
01:08:03,817 --> 01:08:06,286
But the reason why we do
the research on diamond backs

719
01:08:06,319 --> 01:08:10,624
is we want to make something
really cool...

720
01:08:10,657 --> 01:08:14,961
And then, also, a lot of people
aren't very familiar with their snakes.

721
01:08:14,995 --> 01:08:17,798
They'll go out in the wild,
they'll come across this species

722
01:08:17,831 --> 01:08:19,766
and they'll mistake it
for a big one.

723
01:08:32,012 --> 01:08:34,915
[Movie mermaid] Is this a human,
or maybe, a prince?

724
01:08:34,948 --> 01:08:36,917
He doesn't swim very well.

725
01:08:36,950 --> 01:08:38,418
In fact,

726
01:08:38,451 --> 01:08:41,421
he looks so helpless.

727
01:08:41,454 --> 01:08:44,390
[Movie narrator] Immediately,
the little mermaid wanted to help him.

728
01:08:51,031 --> 01:08:52,999
I need you to not
ask questions, okay?

729
01:08:53,033 --> 01:08:54,968
He will surely die.

730
01:08:57,537 --> 01:09:00,440
The little mermaid
rushes to his rescue

731
01:09:00,473 --> 01:09:02,676
and gives him
the breath of life.

732
01:09:02,709 --> 01:09:05,712
She kisses his brow.

733
01:09:05,746 --> 01:09:07,580
His eyes open.

734
01:09:07,614 --> 01:09:10,884
He is surprised.

735
01:09:10,917 --> 01:09:13,954
Do you believe in
love at first sight?

736
01:09:13,987 --> 01:09:15,822
They do.

737
01:09:15,856 --> 01:09:19,292
They spin and twirl
and play together in the sea.

738
01:09:35,909 --> 01:09:38,979
What happened?
What's the matter...

739
01:09:39,012 --> 01:09:41,381
Don't play sweet with
me. Don't touch me.Sorry.

740
01:09:41,414 --> 01:09:43,884
You're a fucking liar.

741
01:09:43,917 --> 01:09:47,754
You've always been
a fucking liar!

742
01:09:47,788 --> 01:09:49,999
And you see what happened.
You'll know this is your fucking fault.

743
01:09:50,023 --> 01:09:51,491
All this is your fucking fault!

744
01:09:51,524 --> 01:09:53,559
You can leave me, it's fine.

745
01:09:53,593 --> 01:09:55,061
I can do this
by myself. No I can't.

746
01:09:55,095 --> 01:09:57,831
I can't fucking leave you.
Get out of the car.

747
01:09:57,864 --> 01:09:59,800
Go! Go!

748
01:10:05,105 --> 01:10:07,040
Grab his legs.

749
01:10:11,812 --> 01:10:13,747
Tip him out.

750
01:10:17,984 --> 01:10:19,920
Go that way.Okay.

751
01:10:34,567 --> 01:10:36,502
Come help me flip him over.

752
01:10:38,138 --> 01:10:40,540
Would you come
help me flip him over?!

753
01:10:44,845 --> 01:10:46,813
You did this.

754
01:10:46,847 --> 01:10:48,982
You did this. You
did this. You see that?

755
01:10:49,015 --> 01:10:50,984
This is your fault.

756
01:10:51,017 --> 01:10:53,419
Do you understand
that? This your fault.

757
01:10:53,453 --> 01:10:55,421
Now help me fucking
turn him over!

758
01:10:55,455 --> 01:10:57,724
Grab his legs and
let me flip it over.

759
01:11:01,027 --> 01:11:03,029
We gotta lift him
in the boat.Okay.

760
01:11:23,717 --> 01:11:26,820
All right, tip... tip it over.

761
01:11:30,556 --> 01:11:33,860
Can you tip
the boat?! Yeah.

762
01:11:33,894 --> 01:11:35,829
All right, now flip him out.

763
01:12:04,590 --> 01:12:06,860
Do you think
they're going to sink?

764
01:12:12,232 --> 01:12:14,167
You think I've ever
done this before?

765
01:12:16,770 --> 01:12:18,104
Answer me.

766
01:12:20,741 --> 01:12:23,944
Say something.
Say something.

767
01:12:23,977 --> 01:12:25,912
Say something.
Say something!

768
01:12:25,946 --> 01:12:27,714
Say something.
Say something!

769
01:12:31,184 --> 01:12:33,586
You deserve all of this.

770
01:12:33,620 --> 01:12:35,856
Marla is going to
be better off...

771
01:12:35,889 --> 01:12:37,924
Marla... the whole world

772
01:12:37,958 --> 01:12:40,961
is going to be better off...

773
01:12:40,994 --> 01:12:43,930
[Thumping]

774
01:13:47,327 --> 01:13:49,262
Shit.

775
01:14:10,216 --> 01:14:12,152
Crystal?!

776
01:14:16,890 --> 01:14:18,825
Crystal!

777
01:14:30,070 --> 01:14:31,972
[Crystal]
I was thinking about it,

778
01:14:32,005 --> 01:14:34,340
and I don't think
if I lived forever

779
01:14:34,374 --> 01:14:38,344
I could ever meet anybody else
who would do anything like this for me.

780
01:14:38,378 --> 01:14:42,215
Parents are supposed to do it,
but I don't even know if my mom would.

781
01:14:42,248 --> 01:14:44,050
She was always
saying things, like,

782
01:14:44,084 --> 01:14:47,353
raising me was something
that messed up her life,

783
01:14:47,387 --> 01:14:49,355
or she gave up
her life to raise me.

784
01:14:49,389 --> 01:14:51,357
And my dad, I don't even know.

785
01:14:51,391 --> 01:14:54,194
He didn't stay around long
enough to get to know me,

786
01:14:54,227 --> 01:14:56,663
or I didn't have a chance
to mess it up.

787
01:15:09,442 --> 01:15:12,078
And I guess I'd like to think
I'd do it for Marla, but...

788
01:15:12,112 --> 01:15:15,081
I think you're the only one.

789
01:15:15,115 --> 01:15:17,751
[Leo] I'm not going to let
anything happen to you.

790
01:15:17,784 --> 01:15:19,753
Really?

791
01:15:19,786 --> 01:15:21,755
Yeah, you're mine.

792
01:15:21,788 --> 01:15:23,890
You mean it? I'm your girl?

793
01:15:23,924 --> 01:15:27,060
Yeah, you're my girl.

794
01:15:27,093 --> 01:15:29,329
I'd do anything for you.

795
01:15:29,362 --> 01:15:31,331
I'd do anything for you.

796
01:15:31,364 --> 01:15:33,299
I'd do anything for you.

797
01:17:04,057 --> 01:17:06,993
[Screen door banging]

798
01:17:13,066 --> 01:17:15,468
[Woman] Do you want
me to call the police?

799
01:17:17,537 --> 01:17:19,472
Not yet.

800
01:17:29,182 --> 01:17:34,020
