1
00:02:19,132 --> 00:02:21,467
First I found the place.

2
00:02:23,325 --> 00:02:25,659
I wondered who had lived there.

3
00:02:25,693 --> 00:02:27,581
What their lives were like.

4
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:33,532
Something whispered
to my mind,

5
00:02:33,567 --> 00:02:35,607
and I began to write.

6
00:02:35,646 --> 00:02:37,687
My pen creates stories

7
00:02:37,727 --> 00:02:40,542
of a world
that might have been-

8
00:02:40,576 --> 00:02:42,813
a world of my imagining.

9
00:02:45,345 --> 00:02:47,800
And here is one
I'm going to tell.

10
00:02:55,009 --> 00:02:57,279
But take care...

11
00:02:57,314 --> 00:03:00,446
not to smile at any part of it.

12
00:03:03,267 --> 00:03:06,137
It begins with a stranger.

13
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:18,370
- Mr. Heathcliff?
- Mr. Heathcliff?

14
00:03:18,405 --> 00:03:21,701
- You'll have to wait.
- You'll have to wait.

15
00:04:18,127 --> 00:04:20,232
Who are you?

16
00:04:20,302 --> 00:04:22,572
Lockwood.

17
00:04:22,607 --> 00:04:24,429
Your new tenant
up at the Grange.

18
00:04:24,463 --> 00:04:27,278
I'm surprised you'd choose
a storm to go wandering

19
00:04:27,312 --> 00:04:28,970
about in, Mr. Lockwood.

20
00:04:29,008 --> 00:04:31,113
Well, I, um...
I lost my way out on the moor.

21
00:04:31,152 --> 00:04:33,870
Is the Grange far?

22
00:04:39,377 --> 00:04:41,068
Perhaps I could get a guide
from amongst your lads.

23
00:04:41,106 --> 00:04:43,113
You could not.

24
00:04:43,154 --> 00:04:45,259
I'll go with him as far

25
00:04:45,298 --> 00:04:46,411
as the park.

26
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:48,174
You'll go with him to hell.

27
00:04:50,355 --> 00:04:52,046
Mr. Heathcliff, if I'm not

28
00:04:52,115 --> 00:04:53,610
to have a guide
to take me up to the Grange,

29
00:04:53,684 --> 00:04:55,473
I shall have to sleep
here tonight.

30
00:04:55,508 --> 00:04:57,418
I don't keep accommodation
for strangers.

31
00:05:06,486 --> 00:05:08,461
Or I'll sleep in the chair.

32
00:05:20,951 --> 00:05:23,373
There's a room they don't use.

33
00:05:36,698 --> 00:05:39,154
Don't leave it by the window.

34
00:05:39,194 --> 00:05:40,569
Why not?

35
00:07:10,792 --> 00:07:13,411
"Catherine Heathcliff. "

36
00:07:13,448 --> 00:07:15,904
"Catherine Linton. "

37
00:07:15,945 --> 00:07:17,734
"Catherine Earnshaw. "

38
00:07:41,965 --> 00:07:46,470
Let me in.

39
00:07:52,142 --> 00:07:53,833
Who the deviI
put you in there?

40
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:56,172
The deviI is right.

41
00:07:57,391 --> 00:07:58,985
She's...

42
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,727
Her face.

43
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,648
She looked like...

44
00:08:07,633 --> 00:08:11,211
You should not have
gone in there.

45
00:08:14,225 --> 00:08:17,968
Lockwood has stumbled into
the end of a strange story...

46
00:08:19,986 --> 00:08:24,689
a story that began
30 years before

47
00:08:24,723 --> 00:08:27,309
when an old man returned
to Wuthering Heights...

48
00:08:28,852 --> 00:08:31,852
weary after a long journey.

49
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:49,872
He's coming!

50
00:08:49,911 --> 00:08:51,155
Joseph.

51
00:08:51,191 --> 00:08:53,133
All right, don't rush me.

52
00:08:55,928 --> 00:08:57,073
Father!

53
00:08:57,112 --> 00:08:58,868
Ah, home again, Cathy.

54
00:08:58,904 --> 00:09:00,792
What have you
brought me, Father?

55
00:09:00,824 --> 00:09:03,443
Cathy, give Father
a chance to draw breath.

56
00:09:03,481 --> 00:09:05,237
Just wait and see.
Wait and see.

57
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:09,523
Oh, my Lord.

58
00:09:09,594 --> 00:09:11,634
I found him...

59
00:09:11,706 --> 00:09:13,812
starving in the streets
of LiverpooI.

60
00:09:13,883 --> 00:09:16,250
He's a filthy gypsy, Father.

61
00:09:16,315 --> 00:09:17,395
He's a gift from God.

62
00:09:17,435 --> 00:09:19,508
You're to treat him
as your new brother.

63
00:09:19,548 --> 00:09:20,922
But where's my present?

64
00:09:20,956 --> 00:09:22,417
Hasn't he got any family
of his own?

65
00:09:22,524 --> 00:09:24,564
He's part of our
family now.

66
00:09:24,604 --> 00:09:27,026
That's your brother- Hindley,

67
00:09:27,068 --> 00:09:28,891
and this...

68
00:09:28,924 --> 00:09:31,030
is your new sister-

69
00:09:31,069 --> 00:09:32,596
Cathy.

70
00:09:34,269 --> 00:09:37,848
Offer your hand as I showed you.

71
00:09:46,015 --> 00:09:48,350
Earnshaw named him Heathcliff.

72
00:09:58,913 --> 00:10:02,776
Cathy was drawn to the silent,
self-possessed boy.

73
00:10:04,674 --> 00:10:09,464
But it was hardness,
not gentleness

74
00:10:09,507 --> 00:10:11,612
that kept him silent.

75
00:10:17,092 --> 00:10:19,678
Nothing here belongs to you-

76
00:10:19,716 --> 00:10:23,611
not now, not ever.

77
00:10:24,965 --> 00:10:26,972
From the very first,

78
00:10:27,014 --> 00:10:30,844
Heathcliff was more Cathy's
brother than Hindley.

79
00:10:30,886 --> 00:10:32,446
Like all wild things,

80
00:10:32,486 --> 00:10:35,618
she shared with him a love
of the open moor.

81
00:10:35,655 --> 00:10:38,689
The rock and the lowering skies.

82
00:10:38,727 --> 00:10:40,615
Oh, mercifuI God,

83
00:10:40,648 --> 00:10:42,819
Father of our Lord
Jesus Christ...

84
00:10:42,888 --> 00:10:46,304
Though Heathcliff became
Mr. Earnshaw's favorite child,

85
00:10:46,377 --> 00:10:48,417
his protection was limited

86
00:10:48,489 --> 00:10:51,555
by the length
of the old man's life.

87
00:10:51,593 --> 00:10:53,960
...shall not die eternally.

88
00:10:53,994 --> 00:10:57,310
You have also taught us
by His holy apostle St. PauI...

89
00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:03,651
Grant this, we beseech Thee,
O mercifuI Father,

90
00:11:03,691 --> 00:11:04,738
through Jesus Christ,

91
00:11:04,779 --> 00:11:07,146
Amen.

92
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:11,304
Your quarters are in
the stables from now on.

93
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:13,733
Heathcliff!

94
00:11:48,145 --> 00:11:49,193
Morning, Cathy.

95
00:11:49,297 --> 00:11:50,225
Morning.

96
00:12:31,192 --> 00:12:32,501
"Then Rab-shakeh stood

97
00:12:32,536 --> 00:12:34,446
"and cried with a loud voice

98
00:12:34,488 --> 00:12:38,832
"in the Jews' language, 'Hear ye
the words of the great king.

99
00:12:38,873 --> 00:12:40,978
"'Hearken not to Hezekiah,

100
00:12:41,049 --> 00:12:43,864
"'for thus bade
the king of Assyria

101
00:12:43,962 --> 00:12:47,345
"'make an agreement with me
by a present.

102
00:12:47,386 --> 00:12:50,583
"'And come out to me and eat
thee every one of his vine

103
00:12:50,715 --> 00:12:52,820
"'and every one of his fig tree

104
00:12:52,891 --> 00:12:54,353
"'and drink ye everyone

105
00:12:54,428 --> 00:12:56,086
the waters of his own
cistern... "'

106
00:13:03,773 --> 00:13:08,182
'untiI I come and take you away
to a land like your own land,"

107
00:13:10,014 --> 00:13:10,941
"'a land of corn and wine,

108
00:13:10,974 --> 00:13:11,901
Hindley, don't...

109
00:13:11,934 --> 00:13:13,341
a land of bread and vineyards. "'

110
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:14,302
Stop it...

111
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:16,245
"'Beware, lest Hezekiah
persuade you. "'

112
00:13:20,575 --> 00:13:21,524
What, done already?

113
00:13:24,256 --> 00:13:26,231
When Father was alive,
we could play on Sunday.

114
00:13:26,304 --> 00:13:27,799
Why not let them be, Hindley?

115
00:13:27,873 --> 00:13:30,240
You put these two down
to their scriptures.

116
00:13:30,305 --> 00:13:34,168
And be sure to examine them
on it this time.

117
00:13:36,962 --> 00:13:38,271
Heather...

118
00:13:39,778 --> 00:13:41,601
AnimaI.

119
00:13:45,859 --> 00:13:47,037
Pepper.

120
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:48,352
Pepper?

121
00:13:48,388 --> 00:13:49,403
Pepper.

122
00:13:55,396 --> 00:13:56,607
Feels like tree bark.

123
00:13:59,462 --> 00:14:00,989
Silver birch.

124
00:14:01,061 --> 00:14:01,989
Silver birch?

125
00:14:02,053 --> 00:14:04,421
Mm. But it's warmer.

126
00:14:10,631 --> 00:14:12,519
My turn.

127
00:14:13,095 --> 00:14:14,557
Shame on you.

128
00:14:14,599 --> 00:14:16,804
Think of your souls!

129
00:14:21,064 --> 00:14:24,578
Master Hindley!
Master Hindley!

130
00:14:33,419 --> 00:14:34,880
What are you thinking about?

131
00:14:37,515 --> 00:14:40,483
I was thinking about the sea.

132
00:14:41,868 --> 00:14:43,013
You ever seen the sea?

133
00:14:43,052 --> 00:14:44,000
No, I was too little.

134
00:14:44,043 --> 00:14:45,288
I don't remember.

135
00:14:46,765 --> 00:14:48,620
My life didn't begin
untiI I...

136
00:14:52,013 --> 00:14:53,191
untiI I...

137
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:55,237
Who sent you?

138
00:14:55,277 --> 00:14:57,034
Nobody.

139
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:58,445
Was it a bird?

140
00:14:58,478 --> 00:14:59,427
Bird.

141
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:00,419
Or a tree?

142
00:15:00,494 --> 00:15:01,607
No, a bird.

143
00:15:01,678 --> 00:15:02,606
Or the wind.

144
00:15:02,638 --> 00:15:04,646
No, a bird.

145
00:15:04,719 --> 00:15:05,701
I don't know.

146
00:15:05,775 --> 00:15:07,531
Do you know anything?

147
00:15:11,472 --> 00:15:13,327
Can you talk to trees?

148
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,433
No.

149
00:15:15,536 --> 00:15:16,747
Talk to the wind?

150
00:15:16,785 --> 00:15:17,996
Mm-mm.

151
00:15:22,738 --> 00:15:27,114
Let's send your spirit
into that tree.

152
00:15:27,154 --> 00:15:28,681
Where?

153
00:15:28,722 --> 00:15:29,671
There.

154
00:15:29,715 --> 00:15:30,730
There?

155
00:15:33,075 --> 00:15:35,531
Make it talk to us.

156
00:15:35,603 --> 00:15:37,971
Talk to me.

157
00:15:38,004 --> 00:15:39,565
Listen.

158
00:15:47,637 --> 00:15:49,263
Oh, listen.

159
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:57,522
They're calling your name.

160
00:15:57,559 --> 00:15:58,574
How did you do that?

161
00:15:58,647 --> 00:15:59,924
I can do lots of things.

162
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:00,887
What things?

163
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:02,446
Stand up.

164
00:16:05,272 --> 00:16:06,679
Where are you going?

165
00:16:06,713 --> 00:16:07,858
Come here.

166
00:16:07,928 --> 00:16:09,554
Come back here.

167
00:16:12,665 --> 00:16:14,127
Come here.

168
00:16:19,386 --> 00:16:20,314
Close your eyes.

169
00:16:23,003 --> 00:16:23,951
Close your eyes.

170
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:31,410
If, when you open your eyes,

171
00:16:31,452 --> 00:16:34,452
the day is sunny and bright,

172
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:36,915
so shall your future be.

173
00:16:37,053 --> 00:16:42,138
But if the day
is full of storms,

174
00:16:42,174 --> 00:16:44,629
so shall be your life.

175
00:16:47,614 --> 00:16:49,949
Now,

176
00:16:49,982 --> 00:16:50,844
open your eyes.

177
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:16,541
What have you done?

178
00:17:19,171 --> 00:17:21,921
I don't care.

179
00:17:21,956 --> 00:17:23,898
Do you hear me?

180
00:17:24,004 --> 00:17:26,721
I don't care.

181
00:17:41,542 --> 00:17:42,884
Where are you going?

182
00:17:42,919 --> 00:17:44,807
To have a look.

183
00:17:44,871 --> 00:17:46,693
Come on!

184
00:17:46,727 --> 00:17:50,622
Sheltered in a valley,
carpeted in crimson,

185
00:17:50,663 --> 00:17:54,941
the Grange,
home of Edgar Linton

186
00:17:54,984 --> 00:17:58,368
and Isabella, his sister.

187
00:18:02,474 --> 00:18:04,481
Doesn't it make you
wish you'd been adopted

188
00:18:04,522 --> 00:18:05,416
by the Lintons?

189
00:18:08,362 --> 00:18:10,599
I wouldn't give up what I have

190
00:18:10,667 --> 00:18:13,286
for a thousand lives
like the Lintons.

191
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:23,043
Come on.

192
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:29,292
Come on! Come on! This way!

193
00:18:29,325 --> 00:18:30,503
Come! Come!

194
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:33,325
Go on! Run!

195
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:34,788
Oh, no, you don't!

196
00:18:40,591 --> 00:18:42,184
Make room.

197
00:18:42,256 --> 00:18:43,500
Ooh, my goodness.

198
00:18:45,808 --> 00:18:48,329
It's Catherine Earnshaw, Father.

199
00:18:48,465 --> 00:18:49,610
- Uh, Fitz.
- Yes, sir.

200
00:18:49,648 --> 00:18:51,056
You had better send
for Dr. Kenneth.

201
00:18:51,089 --> 00:18:52,977
Bring her through.

202
00:18:53,009 --> 00:18:54,897
Leave her be! Leave her!

203
00:18:57,169 --> 00:18:57,933
Come back here!

204
00:18:59,442 --> 00:19:01,329
I think he must be
Earnshaw's gypsy.

205
00:19:01,362 --> 00:19:02,639
Throw him out.

206
00:19:02,674 --> 00:19:04,235
Catherine!

207
00:19:04,275 --> 00:19:05,257
Cathy!

208
00:19:18,133 --> 00:19:20,851
Look at the state of her.

209
00:19:20,885 --> 00:19:23,155
Poor girI.

210
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:26,486
I will speak to Hindley
Earnshaw about this.

211
00:19:26,521 --> 00:19:29,618
She's his own sister.

212
00:19:29,687 --> 00:19:32,534
Perhaps she should
stay here for awhile.

213
00:19:57,947 --> 00:19:59,770
Thank you.

214
00:20:33,184 --> 00:20:34,428
How is she?

215
00:20:37,184 --> 00:20:38,973
Better, I think.

216
00:20:39,009 --> 00:20:42,621
I reckon the Lintons will
be sorry to lose her.

217
00:20:44,738 --> 00:20:46,080
When's she coming home?

218
00:20:53,188 --> 00:20:54,976
Did she ask

219
00:20:55,011 --> 00:20:56,538
about me?

220
00:21:01,604 --> 00:21:03,393
Remember that Mr. Hindley's
forbidden you

221
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:05,338
to speak to Miss Cathy
when she returns.

222
00:21:19,207 --> 00:21:22,339
So she...

223
00:21:22,376 --> 00:21:24,645
she had no message for me?

224
00:21:26,568 --> 00:21:29,635
No doubt we'll all find her
very changed.

225
00:21:50,155 --> 00:21:51,497
Thank you.

226
00:21:51,563 --> 00:21:52,491
How are you?

227
00:21:52,556 --> 00:21:54,018
Much better.
Thank you.

228
00:21:54,092 --> 00:21:55,172
Thank you, Hindley.

229
00:21:55,245 --> 00:21:56,871
Joseph!

230
00:21:58,349 --> 00:22:00,902
Nelly.

231
00:22:00,941 --> 00:22:02,665
Welcome home, Miss Cathy.

232
00:22:02,702 --> 00:22:04,109
Oh, Nelly, what do you
think of her?

233
00:22:04,206 --> 00:22:05,831
She's quite the lady now.

234
00:22:06,767 --> 00:22:09,767
Where's Heathcliff?

235
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:10,983
Heathcliff,

236
00:22:11,022 --> 00:22:13,390
you may come forward.

237
00:22:14,255 --> 00:22:15,662
Wish Miss Catherine welcome

238
00:22:15,696 --> 00:22:17,321
like the rest of the servants.

239
00:22:28,145 --> 00:22:31,462
Well, Heathcliff,
have you forgotten me?

240
00:22:31,538 --> 00:22:34,255
Shake hands.
That is permitted.

241
00:22:38,227 --> 00:22:40,682
I shall not stay
to be laughed at.

242
00:22:42,515 --> 00:22:45,582
I'm sorry.

243
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:47,726
I didn't mean to laugh.

244
00:22:47,764 --> 00:22:48,779
Look at you.

245
00:22:50,517 --> 00:22:52,524
You needn't have touched me.

246
00:23:13,784 --> 00:23:14,994
A little more?

247
00:23:15,033 --> 00:23:16,920
Yes, I'll have some.

248
00:23:29,531 --> 00:23:30,993
Thank you...

249
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:06,581
Get that gypsy out of here!

250
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:17,057
You're not...

251
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:18,018
Stop it!

252
00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:21,214
fit... for a civilized house!

253
00:24:36,293 --> 00:24:38,879
The worst thing
about you is that

254
00:24:38,917 --> 00:24:42,016
you never see anyone else's
obligations.

255
00:24:42,054 --> 00:24:43,810
Oh, my

256
00:24:43,845 --> 00:24:45,504
God.

257
00:24:50,662 --> 00:24:53,052
They looked after me
for three months.

258
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:01,927
I found a lapwing's nest

259
00:25:01,992 --> 00:25:04,197
at Peniston Crag
when you were away.

260
00:25:09,194 --> 00:25:12,042
I waited every day
for a sight of you...

261
00:25:12,074 --> 00:25:13,667
coming over the moors.

262
00:25:14,955 --> 00:25:16,842
But you didn't come.

263
00:25:16,875 --> 00:25:19,242
So I put a wire mesh
over the nest,

264
00:25:19,275 --> 00:25:22,571
and all the little ones
died when they hatched.

265
00:25:22,603 --> 00:25:23,847
Why?

266
00:25:23,884 --> 00:25:25,029
Because the parent birds

267
00:25:25,067 --> 00:25:27,010
couldn't get near
enough to feed them.

268
00:25:27,052 --> 00:25:29,769
No. Why did you starve them?

269
00:25:29,805 --> 00:25:31,299
Well, there wasn't any point

270
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:33,228
in keeping them alive
to show you.

271
00:25:35,597 --> 00:25:37,485
If you'd have come back,
I'd have spared them.

272
00:25:39,758 --> 00:25:42,126
In the future,
you must spare them.

273
00:25:48,879 --> 00:25:50,286
Don't you trust me?

274
00:25:53,488 --> 00:25:55,627
Don't you know
I'll always come back?

275
00:25:55,664 --> 00:25:57,094
Don't you know that?

276
00:25:58,545 --> 00:25:59,974
Heathcliff.

277
00:26:02,706 --> 00:26:04,135
Always.

278
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:18,860
In giving birth, Frances-

279
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:22,217
Hindley Earnshaw's wife- died.

280
00:26:22,261 --> 00:26:25,392
And Hindley, whose sorrow
was of the kind

281
00:26:25,429 --> 00:26:30,034
that could not weep or pray
without her life,

282
00:26:30,069 --> 00:26:32,623
lost all interest in his own.

283
00:26:38,231 --> 00:26:39,824
Name this child.

284
00:26:43,703 --> 00:26:46,551
Hareton Earnshaw.

285
00:26:46,584 --> 00:26:48,591
Hareton Earnshaw...

286
00:26:48,633 --> 00:26:52,146
I baptize thee
in the name of the Father

287
00:26:52,184 --> 00:26:55,447
and of the Son
and of the Holy Ghost.

288
00:26:55,481 --> 00:26:57,968
Amen.

289
00:26:58,010 --> 00:26:59,155
We receive this child

290
00:26:59,194 --> 00:27:00,853
into the congregation
of Christ's flock,

291
00:27:00,890 --> 00:27:04,207
and assign him
to the sign of the cross,

292
00:27:04,251 --> 00:27:06,673
in token that, hereafter,
he shall not be ashamed

293
00:27:06,715 --> 00:27:08,952
to confess the faith
of Christ crucified,

294
00:27:08,987 --> 00:27:11,573
but manfully to fight
under His banner

295
00:27:11,643 --> 00:27:15,353
against sin,
the world and the deviI.

296
00:27:30,494 --> 00:27:31,923
Oh.

297
00:27:34,751 --> 00:27:36,180
What have you got
that silly frock on for?

298
00:27:39,456 --> 00:27:41,463
We're still in mourning,
Miss Cathy.

299
00:27:44,705 --> 00:27:46,112
Shouldn't you be back

300
00:27:46,145 --> 00:27:48,218
in the fields now, Heathcliff?

301
00:27:48,289 --> 00:27:49,598
No.

302
00:27:59,555 --> 00:28:01,464
Ah! Found it.

303
00:28:06,276 --> 00:28:09,310
Edgar and Isabella
Linton said

304
00:28:09,349 --> 00:28:12,197
they might come this afternoon.

305
00:28:13,957 --> 00:28:15,386
Cathy?

306
00:28:25,222 --> 00:28:28,354
The crosses are for the days

307
00:28:28,392 --> 00:28:30,148
you've spent with the Lintons.

308
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,967
The dots are for the days

309
00:28:32,999 --> 00:28:34,593
you've spent with me.

310
00:28:37,993 --> 00:28:39,270
You see?

311
00:28:41,641 --> 00:28:43,397
I've marked every day.

312
00:28:45,002 --> 00:28:46,431
Hmm.

313
00:28:47,914 --> 00:28:49,801
Very foolish.

314
00:28:49,834 --> 00:28:52,256
As if I took notice.

315
00:28:52,331 --> 00:28:55,365
Where's the sense in that?

316
00:28:55,403 --> 00:28:57,738
To show that I do take notice.

317
00:28:57,771 --> 00:28:59,659
Oh, I see.

318
00:29:02,572 --> 00:29:05,572
Should I always
be sitting with you?

319
00:29:05,613 --> 00:29:08,101
You might be dumb
for anything

320
00:29:08,141 --> 00:29:09,865
you say to amuse me.

321
00:29:09,901 --> 00:29:13,317
You never told me before
that I talk too little.

322
00:29:13,358 --> 00:29:16,937
Or that you disliked
my company, Cathy.

323
00:29:18,286 --> 00:29:20,392
That's no company at all,

324
00:29:20,463 --> 00:29:23,759
when people know nothing
and say nothing.

325
00:29:50,131 --> 00:29:52,368
It's so lovely to see you.

326
00:29:54,228 --> 00:29:55,603
Come in.

327
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:32,756
Nelly.

328
00:30:34,618 --> 00:30:37,434
Oh, Cathy.

329
00:30:40,699 --> 00:30:44,594
I thought you were Frances,
risen from the dead.

330
00:30:44,636 --> 00:30:49,176
Nelly, will you keep
a secret for me?

331
00:30:49,212 --> 00:30:52,595
Oh, is it
worth keeping?

332
00:30:55,869 --> 00:30:59,131
Today, Edgar Linton
asked me...

333
00:30:59,166 --> 00:31:01,555
to marry him.

334
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:04,947
Oh... Well...

335
00:31:07,711 --> 00:31:09,435
How should I answer?

336
00:31:12,608 --> 00:31:15,837
Well, really, Miss Cathy,
how should I know?

337
00:31:18,945 --> 00:31:22,207
I accepted him.

338
00:31:22,241 --> 00:31:23,288
Cathy...

339
00:31:25,442 --> 00:31:27,297
Do you love Mr. Edgar?

340
00:31:27,362 --> 00:31:29,751
Um, of course I do.

341
00:31:29,826 --> 00:31:30,808
Of course.

342
00:31:30,882 --> 00:31:32,770
I can't help it.

343
00:31:32,802 --> 00:31:36,098
Why do you love him, Cathy?

344
00:31:36,132 --> 00:31:38,980
Uh, because he's handsome

345
00:31:39,012 --> 00:31:40,955
and pleasant to be with.

346
00:31:40,996 --> 00:31:42,851
Bad.

347
00:31:42,884 --> 00:31:46,529
Because, um... he's young

348
00:31:46,565 --> 00:31:47,809
and cheerfuI.

349
00:31:47,845 --> 00:31:49,340
Bad, still.

350
00:31:51,782 --> 00:31:54,171
And because he'll be rich.

351
00:31:54,214 --> 00:31:57,990
And I shall be the greatest
woman of the neighborhood.

352
00:31:59,911 --> 00:32:01,155
Cathy.

353
00:32:03,847 --> 00:32:05,790
Is that what you really want?

354
00:32:07,368 --> 00:32:10,751
Well, marry Mr. Edgar then.

355
00:32:10,793 --> 00:32:12,517
Where's your obstacle?

356
00:32:20,874 --> 00:32:23,722
Here.

357
00:32:25,899 --> 00:32:29,445
In my souI and in my heart,

358
00:32:29,515 --> 00:32:32,166
I'm convinced I'm wrong.

359
00:32:34,924 --> 00:32:37,859
And if my brother had
not put Heathcliff

360
00:32:37,933 --> 00:32:39,843
so low,

361
00:32:39,917 --> 00:32:42,852
I shouldn't have thought of it.

362
00:32:42,893 --> 00:32:46,985
It would degrade me
to marry Heathcliff now.

363
00:32:48,430 --> 00:32:49,859
So he...

364
00:32:49,903 --> 00:32:52,423
he'll never know I love him.

365
00:32:57,488 --> 00:33:02,126
My great miseries in this world
have been Heathcliff's miseries.

366
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,568
And I watched...

367
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:09,510
and felt each...

368
00:33:09,585 --> 00:33:11,887
from the beginning.

369
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:19,469
My love for Linton is like...

370
00:33:19,507 --> 00:33:21,449
like foliage in the woods.

371
00:33:21,491 --> 00:33:23,183
Time will change it...

372
00:33:25,651 --> 00:33:28,107
as winter changes the trees.

373
00:33:40,054 --> 00:33:42,159
I love Heathcliff.

374
00:33:44,791 --> 00:33:46,220
He's the...

375
00:33:48,951 --> 00:33:51,318
He's like the...

376
00:33:51,352 --> 00:33:53,523
eternaI rocks beneath.

377
00:33:55,672 --> 00:33:59,218
A... A source of literaI,
visible delight...

378
00:34:00,889 --> 00:34:02,416
but necessary.

379
00:34:04,986 --> 00:34:06,230
Nelly...

380
00:34:07,706 --> 00:34:09,616
I am Heathcliff.

381
00:34:13,979 --> 00:34:15,223
Shh.

382
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:16,634
Why?

383
00:34:16,668 --> 00:34:17,977
It's Joseph,

384
00:34:18,011 --> 00:34:19,735
and Heathcliff
might be with him.

385
00:34:22,716 --> 00:34:24,375
In fact, I'm not sure he wasn't

386
00:34:24,412 --> 00:34:26,616
here earlier.

387
00:34:27,933 --> 00:34:31,098
Young deviI of a gypsy
gets worse and worse.

388
00:34:31,133 --> 00:34:32,956
He's left the gate open

389
00:34:32,990 --> 00:34:35,030
and took off
across the moors.

390
00:34:35,134 --> 00:34:36,116
No.

391
00:34:36,158 --> 00:34:37,587
Go and look for him.

392
00:34:37,631 --> 00:34:38,558
Call him back.

393
00:34:38,622 --> 00:34:39,550
What?

394
00:34:39,583 --> 00:34:40,990
Now, go after him.

395
00:34:45,343 --> 00:34:47,253
Do you think he heard?

396
00:34:47,328 --> 00:34:49,467
I think he heard something.

397
00:34:49,536 --> 00:34:52,351
What?

398
00:34:52,416 --> 00:34:55,232
What did I say?

399
00:34:56,898 --> 00:34:59,037
I think he heard up untiI
the bit where you said

400
00:34:59,137 --> 00:35:01,407
it would degrade you
to marry him.

401
00:35:01,442 --> 00:35:03,614
Oh...

402
00:35:06,467 --> 00:35:08,060
Heathcliff!

403
00:35:08,099 --> 00:35:09,408
Cathy!

404
00:35:09,443 --> 00:35:11,101
Heathcliff.

405
00:35:13,283 --> 00:35:15,356
Please, come in, Miss Cathy.

406
00:35:15,492 --> 00:35:17,762
Oh, my God, I lost him.

407
00:35:17,796 --> 00:35:20,066
- Cathy!
- I lost him!

408
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:21,661
Heathcliff...

409
00:35:21,701 --> 00:35:24,669
Heathcliff!

410
00:35:45,032 --> 00:35:47,335
I cannot live without my life.

411
00:35:53,353 --> 00:35:56,103
I cannot live without my souI.

412
00:36:04,204 --> 00:36:09,921
The Heathcliff of her childhood
disappeared forever that night.

413
00:36:09,965 --> 00:36:12,648
She could not find him.

414
00:36:14,765 --> 00:36:16,292
As she recovered,

415
00:36:16,365 --> 00:36:19,213
she waited for his return...

416
00:36:19,277 --> 00:36:21,165
but he did not come.

417
00:36:23,022 --> 00:36:24,910
And eventually,

418
00:36:24,942 --> 00:36:28,139
Cathy turned away from her
old life at Wuthering Heights.

419
00:36:40,593 --> 00:36:42,699
In marrying Edgar,

420
00:36:42,737 --> 00:36:46,185
she found
a measure of happiness.

421
00:36:49,202 --> 00:36:50,479
Two souls as different

422
00:36:50,514 --> 00:36:52,489
as the moonbeam
from lightning...

423
00:36:53,779 --> 00:36:55,470
or frost from fire.

424
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:15,085
But thoughts are tyrants

425
00:37:15,126 --> 00:37:20,178
that return again and again
to torment us.

426
00:37:30,169 --> 00:37:32,056
Joseph!

427
00:37:35,705 --> 00:37:37,593
Confound you, man.

428
00:38:23,648 --> 00:38:25,077
A person from Gimmerton wishes

429
00:38:25,153 --> 00:38:26,200
to see you, ma'am.

430
00:38:26,272 --> 00:38:27,450
What does he want?

431
00:38:27,521 --> 00:38:29,212
I didn't question him.

432
00:38:30,369 --> 00:38:33,119
I'll be back in a moment.

433
00:38:38,691 --> 00:38:41,888
It's not one of Hindley's
creditors, is it?

434
00:38:41,923 --> 00:38:43,134
No, sir.

435
00:38:43,171 --> 00:38:45,441
It's someone the mistress
doesn't expect.

436
00:39:04,838 --> 00:39:06,813
Heathcliff's come back.

437
00:39:08,519 --> 00:39:11,618
Well, don't strangle me
for that.

438
00:39:13,927 --> 00:39:15,488
I know you didn't like him,

439
00:39:15,528 --> 00:39:18,725
but, for my sake,
you must be friends now.

440
00:39:18,824 --> 00:39:20,548
Shall I tell him to come up?

441
00:39:20,585 --> 00:39:23,007
Come on.

442
00:39:23,049 --> 00:39:25,865
You bid him step up.

443
00:39:25,897 --> 00:39:28,385
Catherine, try to be glad
without being absurd

444
00:39:28,458 --> 00:39:30,433
in front of
the whole household.

445
00:39:30,506 --> 00:39:32,928
Heathcliff
is a runaway servant.

446
00:39:50,894 --> 00:39:52,617
Sit down, sir.

447
00:39:55,246 --> 00:39:58,476
Mrs. Linton has asked me
to welcome you.

448
00:39:58,542 --> 00:40:00,931
And, of course,
I'm delighted when anything

449
00:40:01,007 --> 00:40:02,568
occurs to please her.

450
00:40:02,639 --> 00:40:04,046
And I, also.

451
00:40:04,111 --> 00:40:07,690
Especially if it's anything
of which I have a part.

452
00:40:09,905 --> 00:40:11,760
Where have you been
these two years,

453
00:40:11,792 --> 00:40:13,069
Heathcliff?

454
00:40:13,104 --> 00:40:15,472
You seem to have
done very well.

455
00:40:15,505 --> 00:40:17,709
Yes.

456
00:40:21,618 --> 00:40:22,927
Perhaps you came into

457
00:40:22,962 --> 00:40:24,937
your inheritance?

458
00:40:24,978 --> 00:40:26,866
Yes.

459
00:40:28,339 --> 00:40:29,648
You look very fit.

460
00:40:29,683 --> 00:40:31,593
Perhaps you've been

461
00:40:31,636 --> 00:40:33,643
soldiering and seen

462
00:40:33,715 --> 00:40:35,690
some service abroad.

463
00:40:35,764 --> 00:40:38,099
Yes.

464
00:40:39,636 --> 00:40:42,703
I shall... I shall
think it a dream tomorrow.

465
00:40:42,741 --> 00:40:45,011
And yet,

466
00:40:45,045 --> 00:40:47,664
you don't deserve
this welcome.

467
00:40:47,702 --> 00:40:51,314
To be absent and silent
for two years.

468
00:40:51,350 --> 00:40:54,252
I heard of your marriage, Cathy,

469
00:40:54,295 --> 00:40:57,972
not long ago.

470
00:40:58,008 --> 00:41:02,198
I traveled here simply to have
one glimpse of your face.

471
00:41:04,152 --> 00:41:07,764
I fought through a bitter life
since I last heard your voice.

472
00:41:07,801 --> 00:41:11,413
And you must forgive my silence,

473
00:41:11,450 --> 00:41:14,614
for I struggled only for you.

474
00:41:22,267 --> 00:41:23,511
Where are you staying?

475
00:41:25,275 --> 00:41:27,163
At Wuthering Heights.

476
00:41:27,196 --> 00:41:28,440
Hindley Earnshaw

477
00:41:28,476 --> 00:41:30,200
invited you to stay

478
00:41:30,236 --> 00:41:32,506
at Wuthering Heights?

479
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:34,450
It is I who invited him to stay.

480
00:41:34,525 --> 00:41:36,892
It appears
that Hindley mortgaged

481
00:41:36,926 --> 00:41:39,381
the property to cover
his gambling debts.

482
00:41:39,454 --> 00:41:42,618
I was able to assist
my old friend by

483
00:41:42,654 --> 00:41:45,971
taking up his notes.

484
00:41:48,063 --> 00:41:50,551
I am the owner
of Wuthering Heights now.

485
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:53,591
What do you mean?

486
00:41:53,632 --> 00:41:55,705
Hindley and Hareton
are both dispossessed.

487
00:41:55,744 --> 00:41:58,712
It's our old home, after all.

488
00:41:58,753 --> 00:42:01,404
Where Cathy and I grew up.

489
00:42:04,705 --> 00:42:08,055
I have a particular
attachment to it.

490
00:42:21,124 --> 00:42:23,994
Everything's so awake now.

491
00:42:26,533 --> 00:42:28,835
Do you remember how
we pictured heaven?

492
00:42:28,869 --> 00:42:30,975
I remember
how you pictured it.

493
00:42:31,013 --> 00:42:33,380
Mm, how did you picture it?

494
00:42:33,414 --> 00:42:34,941
With you.

495
00:42:34,982 --> 00:42:39,009
Whenever and wherever
you spent time with me.

496
00:42:39,046 --> 00:42:41,600
Go away.

497
00:42:51,688 --> 00:42:53,860
I love you.

498
00:42:58,794 --> 00:43:03,137
When you went away, I removed
myself from the Heights.

499
00:43:03,178 --> 00:43:08,297
I rooted myself in his life,
in the Grange.

500
00:43:08,363 --> 00:43:09,639
I cannot uproot myself again.

501
00:43:09,675 --> 00:43:10,952
Why not?

502
00:43:10,987 --> 00:43:14,730
I cannot.

503
00:43:17,228 --> 00:43:18,789
Let me kiss you good-bye.

504
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:21,675
You won't drive me away
again, Cathy.

505
00:43:21,709 --> 00:43:23,400
I don't want to.

506
00:43:25,645 --> 00:43:28,231
But let us kiss good-bye
as Cathy and Heathcliff

507
00:43:28,270 --> 00:43:30,409
from long ago.

508
00:43:32,143 --> 00:43:34,412
And kiss good-bye to that time.

509
00:43:59,987 --> 00:44:01,995
All right...

510
00:44:02,099 --> 00:44:05,842
we put that time to sleep.

511
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:07,762
When we meet tomorrow,

512
00:44:07,860 --> 00:44:09,551
we will be as we are now.

513
00:44:09,588 --> 00:44:11,377
And I shall kiss you again.

514
00:44:11,413 --> 00:44:13,650
You must never kiss me again.

515
00:44:13,685 --> 00:44:15,693
I love Edgar and
he's dependent on me.

516
00:44:17,526 --> 00:44:20,177
If you kiss me again
I would have to leave him,

517
00:44:20,278 --> 00:44:22,645
and I would not survive.

518
00:44:26,263 --> 00:44:29,744
The surest way to kill me
is for you to kiss me again.

519
00:44:44,569 --> 00:44:50,036
You sent me away because you
knew I wanted to be with him.

520
00:44:50,106 --> 00:44:51,863
I'll not believe this idiocy.

521
00:44:51,931 --> 00:44:54,484
You think you're
in love with Heathcliff?

522
00:44:54,555 --> 00:44:57,654
I love him more than
you ever loved Edgar.

523
00:44:57,723 --> 00:44:59,763
And he'd love me, too,
if you'd let him.

524
00:44:59,804 --> 00:45:02,008
I wouldn't for you
for a kingdom then.

525
00:45:02,044 --> 00:45:03,703
He's an unreclaimed creature.

526
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:05,267
He's a fierce, pitiless,

527
00:45:05,308 --> 00:45:06,835
wolfish man.

528
00:45:06,877 --> 00:45:08,121
It's not true!

529
00:45:08,157 --> 00:45:11,387
Heathcliff has
an honorable souI.

530
00:45:11,421 --> 00:45:13,461
You think I speak from
wicked selfishness?

531
00:45:13,502 --> 00:45:15,477
I'm certain you do.

532
00:45:15,518 --> 00:45:17,460
Good.
Try for yourself.

533
00:45:17,503 --> 00:45:18,932
I'm done.

534
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:26,134
Heathcliff.

535
00:45:27,136 --> 00:45:29,470
We've been quarreling
like cats about you.

536
00:45:29,504 --> 00:45:31,293
Catherine, don't.

537
00:45:33,888 --> 00:45:35,383
Let me go.

538
00:45:35,425 --> 00:45:38,076
My poor sister-in-law
is breaking her heart

539
00:45:38,113 --> 00:45:39,455
by mere contemplation

540
00:45:39,490 --> 00:45:41,694
of your physicaI
and moraI beauty.

541
00:45:43,010 --> 00:45:45,432
And she's sulked since
yesterday's walk

542
00:45:45,474 --> 00:45:47,198
when I sent her out
of your company.

543
00:45:47,234 --> 00:45:50,497
Well, she wished to be out of
my company now, at any rate.

544
00:45:54,916 --> 00:45:55,996
There's a tigress.

545
00:45:56,068 --> 00:45:57,083
Mm.

546
00:45:57,156 --> 00:46:00,506
She's her brother's heir,
isn't she?

547
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:10,463
I believe Cathy
has been painting

548
00:46:10,534 --> 00:46:12,444
a black picture of me.

549
00:46:15,271 --> 00:46:17,857
You mustn't imagine for
a moment that she lies.

550
00:46:20,583 --> 00:46:22,951
I'm a villain.

551
00:46:23,016 --> 00:46:24,926
I'm only after
your fortune.

552
00:46:33,514 --> 00:46:34,976
Devious.

553
00:46:35,050 --> 00:46:36,512
Who?

554
00:46:38,186 --> 00:46:40,325
Your worthless friend.

555
00:46:48,684 --> 00:46:50,091
What are you doing?

556
00:46:50,124 --> 00:46:51,106
What's it to you?

557
00:46:51,149 --> 00:46:53,036
I'm not your husband.

558
00:46:53,069 --> 00:46:54,279
You've treated me infernally.

559
00:46:54,317 --> 00:46:55,332
Infernally...

560
00:46:55,373 --> 00:46:56,388
And if you imagine

561
00:46:56,429 --> 00:46:58,185
I'll suffer unrevenged,
you're a fooI.

562
00:46:58,253 --> 00:46:59,431
I've treated you
infernally?

563
00:46:59,566 --> 00:47:02,468
At least allow me
to amuse myself a little

564
00:47:02,542 --> 00:47:03,949
in the same style.

565
00:47:07,086 --> 00:47:09,029
Have you been listening, Edgar?

566
00:47:10,447 --> 00:47:13,547
You, sir, leave my house
immediately.

567
00:47:13,584 --> 00:47:16,618
If you delay, I
will put you out.

568
00:47:16,656 --> 00:47:20,934
Cathy, this lamb of yours
threatens like a bull.

569
00:47:20,976 --> 00:47:24,076
Ellen, fetch the men.

570
00:47:27,762 --> 00:47:32,302
"Fair" means you haven't
the courage to attack him.

571
00:47:32,371 --> 00:47:36,495
Apologize, or allow yourself
to be beaten.

572
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:40,976
Cathy, give me the key.

573
00:47:44,757 --> 00:47:46,350
I said give me the key.

574
00:47:51,765 --> 00:47:55,311
I wish you joy of the
milk-blooded coward, Cathy.

575
00:47:56,630 --> 00:47:59,478
A compliment to you
on your taste.

576
00:49:09,505 --> 00:49:11,480
I've seen her like this
before, sir.

577
00:49:13,090 --> 00:49:16,636
She's making herself
ill just to spite us.

578
00:49:16,706 --> 00:49:19,903
It could be dangerous
with the baby due.

579
00:49:21,379 --> 00:49:23,551
Please, sir,

580
00:49:23,587 --> 00:49:26,238
couldn't you go
and talk to her?

581
00:49:28,004 --> 00:49:30,241
Yes.

582
00:49:30,276 --> 00:49:32,000
You're right, Ellen.

583
00:49:33,828 --> 00:49:37,244
It was you that brought her
back before, sir,

584
00:49:37,285 --> 00:49:38,496
when Heathcliff ran.

585
00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:42,779
I don't ever want to hear
that man's name mentioned

586
00:49:42,854 --> 00:49:44,283
in this house.

587
00:49:50,215 --> 00:49:53,030
Good night, Ellen.

588
00:50:28,525 --> 00:50:30,500
Heathcliff.

589
00:50:38,670 --> 00:50:40,296
Heathcliff.

590
00:50:40,334 --> 00:50:42,189
Cathy?

591
00:50:42,255 --> 00:50:45,386
Nelly.

592
00:50:45,455 --> 00:50:46,830
Nelly?

593
00:50:53,232 --> 00:50:54,759
Nelly...

594
00:50:54,801 --> 00:50:56,808
I'm afraid of being alone.

595
00:50:56,849 --> 00:50:59,151
No, you're not alone.

596
00:50:59,185 --> 00:51:01,225
Nelly's here now.

597
00:51:01,266 --> 00:51:04,016
Shh. Cathy? Cathy?

598
00:51:04,082 --> 00:51:06,089
Let me feeI the wind.

599
00:51:06,131 --> 00:51:10,604
It come... it comes
straight down off the moor.

600
00:51:10,643 --> 00:51:11,985
No, Cathy.

601
00:51:13,139 --> 00:51:14,187
No...

602
00:51:21,557 --> 00:51:25,136
I wish I were a girI again.

603
00:51:25,205 --> 00:51:30,159
Laughing at injuries,
not maddening under them.

604
00:51:30,198 --> 00:51:32,620
Why am I so changed?

605
00:51:35,606 --> 00:51:37,614
Look.

606
00:51:37,719 --> 00:51:39,924
It's my room.

607
00:51:41,783 --> 00:51:44,118
The candle in the window.

608
00:51:45,913 --> 00:51:49,361
You can't see the house
from here, Cathy.

609
00:51:49,433 --> 00:51:52,597
Joseph's waiting
till I come home.

610
00:51:54,713 --> 00:51:56,983
He'll wait awhile yet.

611
00:51:59,803 --> 00:52:04,986
It's a rough journey
and a sad heart to traveI it.

612
00:52:06,651 --> 00:52:08,691
And we must pass through
Gimmerton Church

613
00:52:08,732 --> 00:52:10,642
to go that journey.

614
00:52:12,572 --> 00:52:16,250
We've braved its ghosts
often together.

615
00:52:16,285 --> 00:52:17,879
We've dared each other

616
00:52:17,950 --> 00:52:21,944
to stand among the graves
and call on them to come.

617
00:52:22,014 --> 00:52:28,855
Heathcliff, if I dare now,
will you venture?

618
00:52:46,561 --> 00:52:48,634
He's considering.

619
00:52:50,466 --> 00:52:53,947
He'd rather I came to him.

620
00:52:54,019 --> 00:52:55,961
You are slow.

621
00:52:57,283 --> 00:52:59,388
You'll always follow me.

622
00:53:05,253 --> 00:53:07,457
Heathcliff...

623
00:53:10,437 --> 00:53:11,386
Cathy?

624
00:53:12,357 --> 00:53:13,306
Push! Push!

625
00:53:14,342 --> 00:53:16,317
Good girI.

626
00:53:16,358 --> 00:53:18,497
Come on, come on.

627
00:53:18,535 --> 00:53:19,615
That's it. Come on.

628
00:53:20,582 --> 00:53:21,510
Push down. Harder.

629
00:53:21,575 --> 00:53:22,503
Looks good.

630
00:53:22,535 --> 00:53:23,779
Harder, harder.

631
00:53:23,847 --> 00:53:25,506
Come on, Cathy.

632
00:53:25,575 --> 00:53:26,982
Good.

633
00:53:27,016 --> 00:53:28,096
That's a good girI.
Good girI.

634
00:53:48,747 --> 00:53:50,689
Mrs. Dean wishes
to see you.

635
00:54:06,898 --> 00:54:08,272
How's Cathy?

636
00:54:08,306 --> 00:54:11,240
Mrs. Linton has had
a little girI.

637
00:54:11,282 --> 00:54:13,070
So...

638
00:54:13,106 --> 00:54:15,211
the Linton estate...

639
00:54:15,250 --> 00:54:16,363
belongs to

640
00:54:16,402 --> 00:54:18,027
my wife.

641
00:54:19,730 --> 00:54:22,861
You seem to forget
my brother is still alive.

642
00:54:22,897 --> 00:54:24,359
I've not forgotten
for an instant.

643
00:54:24,402 --> 00:54:25,744
This young lady

644
00:54:25,810 --> 00:54:28,657
is looking sadly the worse
for a change in circumstance.

645
00:54:28,690 --> 00:54:31,919
Somebody's love falls far short
in her case, obviously.

646
00:54:31,954 --> 00:54:32,936
Her own.

647
00:54:33,009 --> 00:54:34,897
She hates herself.

648
00:54:34,929 --> 00:54:36,238
As you see,

649
00:54:36,274 --> 00:54:38,695
she degenerates
into a mere slut.

650
00:54:38,738 --> 00:54:40,843
It was a marvelous effort
on her part

651
00:54:40,881 --> 00:54:42,375
to discover that I did not

652
00:54:42,482 --> 00:54:44,172
love her.

653
00:54:44,210 --> 00:54:45,224
But at last, I think

654
00:54:45,266 --> 00:54:47,338
she begins to know me.

655
00:54:49,073 --> 00:54:52,488
Tell your Master Nelly
that I never in all my life

656
00:54:52,529 --> 00:54:55,912
met with such an
abject thing as she.

657
00:54:55,953 --> 00:54:59,084
She even disgraces
the name of Linton.

658
00:55:00,849 --> 00:55:02,223
Take care, Ellen.

659
00:55:02,257 --> 00:55:06,054
He wishes to provoke Edgar
to desperation.

660
00:55:06,129 --> 00:55:08,137
I'll die first.

661
00:55:09,905 --> 00:55:13,004
The single pleasure
I can imagine is to die...

662
00:55:14,737 --> 00:55:16,776
or see him dead.

663
00:55:16,817 --> 00:55:18,605
There.

664
00:55:19,697 --> 00:55:21,802
That will do for the moment.

665
00:55:33,265 --> 00:55:35,469
What will they name her?

666
00:55:35,504 --> 00:55:38,155
Cathy's daughter?

667
00:55:39,952 --> 00:55:41,578
Catherine.

668
00:55:43,248 --> 00:55:44,874
Catherine Linton.

669
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:50,215
Hareton?

670
00:55:53,937 --> 00:55:55,530
I remember when this house

671
00:55:55,568 --> 00:55:59,365
was full of the sound
of laughter, Mr. Hindley.

672
00:55:59,408 --> 00:56:01,710
Now there's nothing
but bitterness and hatred.

673
00:56:04,112 --> 00:56:05,094
Stay where you are.

674
00:56:05,168 --> 00:56:08,070
You're not going yet.
Sit down!

675
00:56:21,392 --> 00:56:22,733
Ellen...

676
00:56:22,768 --> 00:56:25,419
I must see her.

677
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:30,030
Try and understand.

678
00:56:30,063 --> 00:56:32,168
Cathy's very ill.

679
00:56:32,208 --> 00:56:34,629
Another encounter
between you and Mr. Edgar

680
00:56:34,767 --> 00:56:35,749
would probably kill her.

681
00:56:35,823 --> 00:56:37,230
I must see her, Nelly.

682
00:56:45,456 --> 00:56:47,179
Cathy.

683
00:57:05,936 --> 00:57:07,496
How can I bear it?

684
00:57:10,255 --> 00:57:13,157
You and Edgar have broken
my heart.

685
00:57:16,847 --> 00:57:19,214
And now...

686
00:57:19,247 --> 00:57:20,970
you come to me

687
00:57:21,007 --> 00:57:23,494
as if you were the
one to be pitied.

688
00:57:25,167 --> 00:57:27,371
I shall not pity you.

689
00:57:27,407 --> 00:57:29,295
- You've killed me.
- No...

690
00:57:29,359 --> 00:57:30,537
Will you forget me?

691
00:57:30,575 --> 00:57:32,964
Will you be happy
when I'm in the earth?

692
00:57:33,007 --> 00:57:34,730
Are you possessed
with the deviI

693
00:57:34,767 --> 00:57:36,741
to talk in that manner to me
when you're dying?

694
00:57:38,319 --> 00:57:39,846
Can't you see

695
00:57:39,983 --> 00:57:43,245
that all those words
will be branded in my memory

696
00:57:43,278 --> 00:57:44,620
and eating deeper

697
00:57:44,654 --> 00:57:46,542
eternally while you
are at peace?

698
00:57:46,574 --> 00:57:48,265
I shall not be at peace.

699
00:57:56,207 --> 00:57:58,312
I don't mean to torture you.

700
00:57:59,406 --> 00:58:01,479
Please, Heathcliff...

701
00:58:02,478 --> 00:58:04,169
do come to me.

702
00:58:04,206 --> 00:58:06,115
Please.

703
00:58:13,518 --> 00:58:16,813
Why did you betray
your own heart, Cathy?

704
00:58:19,886 --> 00:58:21,642
You loved me...

705
00:58:24,078 --> 00:58:26,729
and what right had
you to leave me?

706
00:58:28,910 --> 00:58:32,684
The poor fancy you
felt for Linton?

707
00:58:32,718 --> 00:58:36,744
Nothing that God or Satan
could inflict

708
00:58:36,781 --> 00:58:38,854
would have parted us.

709
00:58:39,821 --> 00:58:43,170
You, of your own will, did it.

710
00:58:44,654 --> 00:58:47,021
I've not broken
your heart, Cathy.

711
00:58:47,053 --> 00:58:48,679
You have broken it,

712
00:58:48,717 --> 00:58:52,579
and in breaking it,
you've broken mine.

713
00:58:55,181 --> 00:58:58,825
If I've done wrong,

714
00:58:58,861 --> 00:59:02,025
I'm dying for it.

715
00:59:02,061 --> 00:59:04,232
You left me, too...

716
00:59:05,229 --> 00:59:07,084
but I forgive you.

717
00:59:09,421 --> 00:59:11,308
Forgive me.

718
00:59:11,341 --> 00:59:12,835
It's hard.

719
00:59:12,877 --> 00:59:16,423
It's so hard...

720
00:59:16,493 --> 00:59:18,020
to forgive.

721
00:59:18,093 --> 00:59:20,940
I look... at those eyes...

722
00:59:24,461 --> 00:59:25,868
Yes...

723
00:59:25,901 --> 00:59:29,348
I forgive what
you've done to me.

724
00:59:30,188 --> 00:59:33,484
I love my murderer,

725
00:59:33,517 --> 00:59:36,201
but yours-

726
00:59:36,237 --> 00:59:38,309
How can I?

727
00:59:42,637 --> 00:59:44,065
How can I?

728
01:00:10,988 --> 01:00:12,898
She's dead.

729
01:00:19,468 --> 01:00:22,151
I've not waited for you
to learn that.

730
01:00:23,339 --> 01:00:26,635
Put your handkerchief away.

731
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:29,121
Don't sniveI before me.

732
01:00:32,044 --> 01:00:34,597
Damn you all.

733
01:00:35,884 --> 01:00:38,022
She wants none of your tears.

734
01:00:38,060 --> 01:00:41,158
She lies at peace now,
Heathcliff.

735
01:00:44,044 --> 01:00:45,866
May she wake as kindly
in the next world.

736
01:00:47,243 --> 01:00:49,348
May she wake in torment.

737
01:00:57,836 --> 01:00:59,875
I pray one prayer.

738
01:01:02,284 --> 01:01:05,317
I repeat it
till my tongue stiffens.

739
01:01:08,204 --> 01:01:11,520
Catherine Earnshaw,

740
01:01:11,563 --> 01:01:14,246
may you not rest
as long as I am living.

741
01:01:14,283 --> 01:01:15,363
Heathcliff, don't!

742
01:01:15,403 --> 01:01:17,312
You said I killed you.

743
01:01:18,603 --> 01:01:20,513
Haunt me, then.

744
01:01:21,803 --> 01:01:25,545
I know that ghosts
have wandered the earth.

745
01:01:25,611 --> 01:01:28,458
Be with me always,

746
01:01:28,491 --> 01:01:31,338
take any form,

747
01:01:31,371 --> 01:01:33,226
drive me mad...

748
01:01:36,139 --> 01:01:38,986
only do not leave me

749
01:01:39,019 --> 01:01:41,888
in this abyss
where I cannot find you.

750
01:01:48,811 --> 01:01:51,015
Oh...

751
01:01:52,139 --> 01:01:53,633
God...

752
01:01:55,018 --> 01:01:57,255
I cannot live without my life.

753
01:02:04,618 --> 01:02:07,171
I cannot live without my souI.

754
01:03:29,929 --> 01:03:32,929
...to raise us
from the death of sin

755
01:03:32,969 --> 01:03:34,398
unto the life
of righteousness,

756
01:03:34,441 --> 01:03:36,448
that when we shall depart
this life,

757
01:03:36,521 --> 01:03:38,408
we may rest in Him,

758
01:03:38,441 --> 01:03:41,255
as our hope is this,
our brother doth,

759
01:03:41,289 --> 01:03:44,453
and that, at the generaI
resurrection in the last day,

760
01:03:44,488 --> 01:03:46,528
he may be found acceptable
in Thy sight,

761
01:03:46,568 --> 01:03:49,732
and receive that blessing,
as Thy well-beloved son...

762
01:03:49,769 --> 01:03:51,656
Before the spring was out,

763
01:03:51,689 --> 01:03:56,609
Cathy's brother Hindley
followed her to the grave.

764
01:03:56,649 --> 01:03:59,398
He drank himself into oblivion,

765
01:03:59,433 --> 01:04:02,815
leaving Hareton,
his son and heir,

766
01:04:02,857 --> 01:04:07,013
to try to wake some love in
Heathcliff's embittered heart.

767
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:08,008
- Amen.

768
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:10,145
- Amen.
- Amen.

769
01:04:11,176 --> 01:04:14,210
Now, my bonnie lad,
you're mine.

770
01:04:14,248 --> 01:04:16,768
Let's see if one tree
won't grow as crooked as another

771
01:04:16,808 --> 01:04:19,459
with the same wind
to twist it.

772
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:32,258
So Heathcliff claimed
the last surviving Earnshaw.

773
01:04:33,543 --> 01:04:35,910
As the father had used him,

774
01:04:35,944 --> 01:04:38,016
so he would use the son.

775
01:05:10,375 --> 01:05:13,026
I was looking for birds' nests.

776
01:05:23,367 --> 01:05:26,214
18 years have passed.

777
01:05:26,247 --> 01:05:28,003
Catherine Linton,

778
01:05:28,039 --> 01:05:31,683
Cathy and Edgar's daughter,
grown up

779
01:05:31,751 --> 01:05:34,052
within the confines
of the Grange,

780
01:05:34,087 --> 01:05:35,909
sheltered by her father...

781
01:05:35,942 --> 01:05:37,120
Catherine!

782
01:05:37,159 --> 01:05:38,565
and never knew the nearness

783
01:05:38,599 --> 01:05:41,763
of the wild inhabitants
of the Heights...

784
01:05:44,391 --> 01:05:46,278
untiI today.

785
01:06:29,926 --> 01:06:31,933
Now...

786
01:06:31,974 --> 01:06:34,429
who is this?

787
01:06:34,470 --> 01:06:36,258
- Can you tell?
- Your son?

788
01:06:36,294 --> 01:06:38,149
Yes, but don't you recognize

789
01:06:38,182 --> 01:06:40,287
your cousin...

790
01:06:41,254 --> 01:06:42,432
Linton?

791
01:06:42,470 --> 01:06:44,379
Linton.

792
01:06:46,342 --> 01:06:47,269
I thought you lived

793
01:06:47,302 --> 01:06:48,512
in London.

794
01:06:48,582 --> 01:06:50,011
Father sent for me
when Mother died.

795
01:06:52,934 --> 01:06:54,625
Well, have you nothing to show

796
01:06:54,661 --> 01:06:56,417
your cousin?

797
01:06:56,454 --> 01:06:58,363
Take her outside.

798
01:07:05,414 --> 01:07:07,323
I do not think
my father likes you,

799
01:07:07,365 --> 01:07:08,293
Uncle.

800
01:07:08,325 --> 01:07:10,213
I imagine he thought me
unworthy

801
01:07:10,245 --> 01:07:12,612
to marry his sister.

802
01:07:30,853 --> 01:07:33,089
What does that
inscription mean?

803
01:07:34,533 --> 01:07:36,769
Some damnable writing.
I can't read it.

804
01:07:36,805 --> 01:07:38,976
I can read it.

805
01:07:39,013 --> 01:07:40,257
I want to know why
it's there.

806
01:07:40,293 --> 01:07:42,682
Can you believe
in the existence

807
01:07:42,725 --> 01:07:44,929
of such a colossaI dunce?

808
01:07:47,012 --> 01:07:49,249
Can't even read his own name.

809
01:07:57,253 --> 01:07:59,970
Is that your name-
Hareton Earnshaw?

810
01:08:01,412 --> 01:08:02,973
My mother's name was Earnshaw.

811
01:08:03,013 --> 01:08:04,442
Didn't you know?

812
01:08:04,485 --> 01:08:06,143
Hareton is also your cousin.

813
01:08:09,125 --> 01:08:10,586
How do you do?

814
01:08:35,748 --> 01:08:37,821
Father.

815
01:08:41,540 --> 01:08:44,028
Guess who I saw today
on my walk in the moors?

816
01:08:44,068 --> 01:08:46,457
Ellen has already
told me, Catherine.

817
01:08:49,988 --> 01:08:53,021
Why do you forbid me
to visit Wuthering Heights?

818
01:08:57,060 --> 01:08:59,067
Is it...

819
01:08:59,140 --> 01:09:01,823
is it because
you dislike Mr. Heathcliff?

820
01:09:02,755 --> 01:09:04,032
No...

821
01:09:04,067 --> 01:09:07,166
not because I dislike
Mr. Heathcliff,

822
01:09:07,203 --> 01:09:09,407
but because Mr. Heathcliff

823
01:09:09,444 --> 01:09:10,720
dislikes me.

824
01:09:13,123 --> 01:09:15,512
He was quite pleasant,
Father.

825
01:09:19,683 --> 01:09:21,593
Sit down.

826
01:09:26,115 --> 01:09:28,025
I have no male heir, Catherine.

827
01:09:28,100 --> 01:09:31,263
I'm certain that Heathcliff

828
01:09:31,299 --> 01:09:33,535
seeks by some means

829
01:09:33,571 --> 01:09:37,248
to dispossess you
of your inheritance...

830
01:09:37,347 --> 01:09:40,413
and in that way,

831
01:09:40,451 --> 01:09:43,036
to revenge himself on me.

832
01:09:47,043 --> 01:09:49,050
He's a diabolicaI man,
Catherine.

833
01:09:50,723 --> 01:09:52,545
He will stop at nothing

834
01:09:52,579 --> 01:09:55,677
to bring down those he hates.

835
01:09:59,875 --> 01:10:02,330
She might have
been living yet...

836
01:10:04,419 --> 01:10:06,972
had it not been for him.

837
01:10:09,250 --> 01:10:11,225
Dearest Catherine...

838
01:10:17,155 --> 01:10:19,937
why have you not
come back to me?

839
01:10:22,594 --> 01:10:27,744
Every day... I wait for you.

840
01:10:33,730 --> 01:10:39,393
My one waking thought
has been of you.

841
01:10:39,426 --> 01:10:43,136
Perhaps Uncle Edgar

842
01:10:43,170 --> 01:10:47,261
has forbidden you
to visit Wuthering Heights.

843
01:10:47,329 --> 01:10:52,545
You must find a way
of seeing me again.

844
01:10:59,586 --> 01:11:03,415
My life didn't begin

845
01:11:03,490 --> 01:11:06,392
untiI I saw your face.

846
01:11:06,497 --> 01:11:10,174
Why have you not...

847
01:11:10,210 --> 01:11:12,032
come back to me...

848
01:11:14,273 --> 01:11:16,183
Catherine?

849
01:11:20,514 --> 01:11:23,481
I have waited so long.

850
01:11:25,441 --> 01:11:27,775
Now...

851
01:11:27,809 --> 01:11:29,183
sign it...

852
01:11:32,290 --> 01:11:34,745
"Linton. "

853
01:12:11,968 --> 01:12:13,462
Are you sick?

854
01:12:13,536 --> 01:12:15,609
No, I'm feeling better.

855
01:12:15,648 --> 01:12:16,695
I'm just tired.

856
01:12:16,737 --> 01:12:17,685
Oh.

857
01:12:27,584 --> 01:12:30,650
Well, cousin,
I'm here at your command.

858
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:35,607
Uh, you look well,

859
01:12:35,680 --> 01:12:37,502
Miss Linton.

860
01:12:37,568 --> 01:12:39,805
Miss Linton?

861
01:12:41,408 --> 01:12:42,553
Miss Linton.

862
01:12:44,032 --> 01:12:47,032
My father is gravely ill
after fighting

863
01:12:47,072 --> 01:12:49,822
to come here because
you begged me to.

864
01:12:49,855 --> 01:12:52,703
What is it you want of me?

865
01:12:57,183 --> 01:12:58,776
My house isn't

866
01:12:58,816 --> 01:13:00,506
stricken with the plague.

867
01:13:00,575 --> 01:13:03,161
Sit down and have some tea.

868
01:13:17,759 --> 01:13:19,417
Miss, um,

869
01:13:19,456 --> 01:13:22,325
Linton... I...

870
01:13:24,352 --> 01:13:26,294
I give you what I have.

871
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:32,629
The present is hardly worth
accepting, but

872
01:13:32,671 --> 01:13:33,599
I have nothing else

873
01:13:33,631 --> 01:13:35,965
to offer.

874
01:13:35,999 --> 01:13:37,755
It is my son.

875
01:13:38,975 --> 01:13:40,404
Linton.

876
01:13:40,447 --> 01:13:41,429
What are you saying?

877
01:13:45,087 --> 01:13:46,745
Father wants us to be married.

878
01:13:48,639 --> 01:13:50,166
He knows Uncle Edgar
won't allow it

879
01:13:50,207 --> 01:13:51,614
while he lives,
but he's afraid

880
01:13:51,646 --> 01:13:54,013
of my dying if we wait.

881
01:13:54,047 --> 01:13:56,535
So we are to be married tonight

882
01:13:56,575 --> 01:13:59,030
and then Father will be
master of the Grange.

883
01:14:01,439 --> 01:14:03,381
I'm not afraid of you.

884
01:14:03,422 --> 01:14:04,884
Give me that key.

885
01:14:22,303 --> 01:14:23,928
Help me!

886
01:14:38,527 --> 01:14:42,072
No one knows
you're here, Catherine.

887
01:14:42,110 --> 01:14:46,039
I swear, you will not
leave this house

888
01:14:46,142 --> 01:14:47,604
untiI I am your father.

889
01:14:49,182 --> 01:14:52,182
The only father you'll
have in a day or two.

890
01:14:55,422 --> 01:14:57,877
Oh, you're
not afraid of me, hmm?

891
01:14:57,918 --> 01:15:01,213
Your courage is well disguised.

892
01:15:02,526 --> 01:15:04,893
I am afraid now,

893
01:15:04,926 --> 01:15:08,187
because if I stay, my
father will be miserable.

894
01:15:08,222 --> 01:15:09,302
Let me go home.

895
01:15:12,349 --> 01:15:15,732
His happiest days were over
when your days began.

896
01:15:15,837 --> 01:15:17,299
He cursed you,

897
01:15:17,374 --> 01:15:20,156
as I did, for coming
into this world.

898
01:15:20,189 --> 01:15:22,131
Weep away.

899
01:15:22,205 --> 01:15:25,467
It'll be your
chief diversion hereafter.

900
01:15:26,653 --> 01:15:30,330
Mr. Heathcliff,
you're a crueI man,

901
01:15:30,366 --> 01:15:32,787
but you're not a fiend.

902
01:15:32,829 --> 01:15:35,480
If my father died
before I returned,

903
01:15:35,518 --> 01:15:37,939
could I bear to live?

904
01:15:37,981 --> 01:15:41,626
I'm going to kneeI here,
at your feet,

905
01:15:41,661 --> 01:15:43,516
and I'll not get up

906
01:15:43,549 --> 01:15:46,037
till you look back at me.

907
01:15:46,077 --> 01:15:49,907
Don't turn away.
Look.

908
01:15:52,061 --> 01:15:54,908
Have you never loved
anybody in all your life,

909
01:15:54,941 --> 01:15:57,177
Uncle- Never?

910
01:16:03,389 --> 01:16:04,469
Keep your fingers off.

911
01:16:06,173 --> 01:16:09,434
Move or I'll kick you.

912
01:16:10,685 --> 01:16:14,613
How the deviI can you
dream of fawning on me?

913
01:16:14,653 --> 01:16:18,100
I detest you.

914
01:17:26,203 --> 01:17:27,665
Ellen!

915
01:17:50,747 --> 01:17:52,503
Uh-uh-uh, "I require

916
01:17:52,539 --> 01:17:54,001
"and charge you both,

917
01:17:54,043 --> 01:17:57,174
"as you will answer at the
dreadfuI day of judgment,

918
01:17:57,243 --> 01:18:00,407
"when the secrets of all

919
01:18:00,475 --> 01:18:03,890
"that if either of you

920
01:18:03,963 --> 01:18:07,640
"why ye may not be lawfully

921
01:18:07,675 --> 01:18:10,871
"ye do now confess it.

922
01:18:10,907 --> 01:18:14,136
"For be ye well assured,

01:18:14,171 --> 01:18:17,040
"that so many as
are coupled together

924
01:18:17,114 --> 01:18:19,449
"otherwise than
God's Word doth allow,

925
01:18:19,482 --> 01:18:22,897
"are not joined
together by God.

926
01:18:22,938 --> 01:18:26,768
Neither is their
matrimony lawfuI."

927
01:18:42,938 --> 01:18:46,102
I've been waiting
for you to come.

928
01:18:48,570 --> 01:18:50,742
Is it true you've married?

929
01:18:50,778 --> 01:18:53,593
I have.

930
01:18:53,626 --> 01:18:55,830
You happy?

931
01:18:55,866 --> 01:18:58,102
Yes.

932
01:19:00,698 --> 01:19:03,032
Your fortune belongs
to Heathcliff now.

933
01:19:05,402 --> 01:19:08,184
Tell me you're safe.

934
01:19:08,218 --> 01:19:11,666
That Linton will protect you.

935
01:19:11,706 --> 01:19:15,055
He will protect me.

936
01:19:15,098 --> 01:19:18,807
So be it.

937
01:19:28,409 --> 01:19:30,776
I'm going to her now.

938
01:19:33,721 --> 01:19:37,398
Father...

939
01:19:37,434 --> 01:19:38,960
No.

940
01:20:05,881 --> 01:20:08,052
What was she like?

941
01:20:09,432 --> 01:20:10,578
What was who like?

942
01:20:13,113 --> 01:20:15,001
My mother.

943
01:20:18,009 --> 01:20:20,627
She was a wild,
wicked slip of a girI.

944
01:20:22,201 --> 01:20:24,143
She burned too bright
for this world.

945
01:20:37,753 --> 01:20:39,858
Am I like her?

946
01:20:41,944 --> 01:20:43,799
I see her mostly in Hareton.

947
01:20:57,273 --> 01:21:01,680
I've come to fetch you home
to Wuthering Heights.

948
01:21:01,720 --> 01:21:03,607
I've found a new tenant
for this house,

949
01:21:03,639 --> 01:21:06,509
and I want my children about me.

950
01:21:06,552 --> 01:21:08,756
Go make yourself ready.

951
01:21:24,119 --> 01:21:27,632
I haven't been in this room
since the night I returned.

952
01:21:49,816 --> 01:21:54,289
I've made the sexton remove
the earth from her coffin.

953
01:21:56,695 --> 01:21:58,735
Aren't you ashamed
to disturb the dead?

954
01:21:58,775 --> 01:22:00,433
I disturb nobody.

955
01:22:03,063 --> 01:22:05,452
I gave myself some ease...

956
01:22:05,495 --> 01:22:08,048
when I saw her face again.

957
01:22:13,751 --> 01:22:15,573
It is her as yet.

958
01:22:36,151 --> 01:22:38,355
Your son is dead.

959
01:22:39,350 --> 01:22:42,220
How do you feeI?

960
01:22:49,622 --> 01:22:52,470
How do you feeI, Catherine?

961
01:22:55,030 --> 01:22:58,030
I feeI and see only death.

962
01:23:02,550 --> 01:23:04,437
Come to the fire-
you must be frozen.

963
01:23:04,470 --> 01:23:06,357
Get away from me.

964
01:23:06,390 --> 01:23:08,757
How dare you touch me...

965
01:23:11,158 --> 01:23:14,192
when I would've given
my life for one kind word

966
01:23:14,230 --> 01:23:15,823
when I was imprisoned.

967
01:23:15,862 --> 01:23:18,383
You kept off.

968
01:23:21,462 --> 01:23:24,277
Do you think
I'm going to accept friendship

969
01:23:24,309 --> 01:23:26,065
from you now?

970
01:23:30,325 --> 01:23:33,522
I've only come into this room
'cause I'm cold.

971
01:23:49,845 --> 01:23:51,733
What is it?

972
01:23:51,765 --> 01:23:53,969
My son's will.

973
01:23:54,037 --> 01:23:57,452
He left the Grange and all
your personaI property to me.

974
01:23:57,525 --> 01:23:58,954
Look where he signed it...

975
01:23:59,029 --> 01:24:00,916
"Linton. "

976
01:24:06,037 --> 01:24:08,687
It doesn't matter.

977
01:24:08,725 --> 01:24:11,474
Nothing matters now.

978
01:24:25,492 --> 01:24:26,540
There we are.

979
01:24:26,612 --> 01:24:28,620
There we are. Shh...

980
01:24:31,381 --> 01:24:33,268
Shh.

981
01:25:11,540 --> 01:25:14,540
He's just like a
cart horse, isn't he.

982
01:25:14,580 --> 01:25:16,467
He does his work,

983
01:25:16,500 --> 01:25:18,158
gets his food,

984
01:25:18,196 --> 01:25:19,657
and sleeps.

985
01:25:19,700 --> 01:25:21,773
Do you ever
dream, Hareton?

986
01:25:26,675 --> 01:25:29,359
I find out that I'm glad...

987
01:25:29,428 --> 01:25:31,118
that I should like you to be
my cousin.

988
01:25:33,076 --> 01:25:35,443
Hareton.

989
01:25:35,508 --> 01:25:37,996
Hareton?

990
01:25:38,036 --> 01:25:40,403
Do you hear?

991
01:25:57,075 --> 01:25:58,636
Go to the deviI and let me be.

992
01:25:58,675 --> 01:26:00,082
No, I won't.

993
01:26:00,116 --> 01:26:01,544
You must
listen to me.

994
01:26:01,588 --> 01:26:03,954
I'll go to hell body and souI
before I look sideways at you

995
01:26:04,019 --> 01:26:04,880
again.

996
01:26:04,915 --> 01:26:05,843
You should be friends
with your cousin.

997
01:26:06,867 --> 01:26:08,274
Friend?

998
01:26:08,308 --> 01:26:10,479
When she hates me?

999
01:26:10,515 --> 01:26:12,271
Thinks me not fit
to wipe her shoes.

1000
01:26:14,674 --> 01:26:17,162
It's not I who hates you;
it's you

1001
01:26:17,202 --> 01:26:18,315
who hates me.

1002
01:26:18,355 --> 01:26:19,283
You hate me

1003
01:26:19,315 --> 01:26:21,486
as much
as Mr. Heathcliff does.

1004
01:26:21,523 --> 01:26:22,450
And more.

1005
01:26:22,483 --> 01:26:23,181
You're a damn liar!

1006
01:26:23,218 --> 01:26:25,106
Why have I made him
angry then

1007
01:26:25,138 --> 01:26:27,277
by taking your part
a hundred times?

1008
01:26:30,163 --> 01:26:33,163
I didn't know you took my part.

1009
01:27:00,595 --> 01:27:02,187
Mrs. Dean?

1010
01:27:02,226 --> 01:27:03,982
Mm-hmm?

1011
01:27:04,018 --> 01:27:04,946
Please

1012
01:27:05,010 --> 01:27:07,399
convey this gift
to Mr. Hareton Earnshaw,

1013
01:27:07,538 --> 01:27:10,887
and tell him, if he'll take it,

1014
01:27:10,962 --> 01:27:12,488
I'll come and teach him

1015
01:27:12,562 --> 01:27:14,155
to read it.

1016
01:27:14,194 --> 01:27:16,081
And if he refuses,
I'll go upstairs

1017
01:27:16,146 --> 01:27:18,383
and never tease him again.

1018
01:27:40,210 --> 01:27:41,836
So, you forgive me?

1019
01:27:42,866 --> 01:27:44,011
You'll be ashamed of me

1020
01:27:44,050 --> 01:27:45,741
every day of your life,

1021
01:27:48,690 --> 01:27:50,031
and the more...

1022
01:27:50,066 --> 01:27:52,651
the more you know me.

1023
01:27:52,690 --> 01:27:54,795
So you won't be my friend?

1024
01:28:13,649 --> 01:28:16,551
Mr. Heathcliff...

1025
01:28:16,625 --> 01:28:19,178
I want to make a small garden.

1026
01:28:20,625 --> 01:28:22,535
They'll be no gardens here.

1027
01:28:24,785 --> 01:28:26,028
You shouldn't grouch a few yards

1028
01:28:26,096 --> 01:28:27,307
of earth

1029
01:28:27,345 --> 01:28:28,774
when you've taken all my land.

1030
01:28:29,777 --> 01:28:31,599
Your land, you insolent slut?!

1031
01:28:31,633 --> 01:28:33,455
- You never had any!
- And my money.

1032
01:28:33,489 --> 01:28:34,437
That's enough.

1033
01:28:37,905 --> 01:28:39,465
And Hareton's land,

1034
01:28:39,505 --> 01:28:41,261
- and his money.
- You must not speak to him so.

1035
01:28:42,289 --> 01:28:43,914
If you strike me,

1036
01:28:43,984 --> 01:28:46,351
Hareton will defend me,

1037
01:28:46,385 --> 01:28:48,359
so you may as well sit down.

1038
01:28:51,857 --> 01:28:54,159
You dare to try and rouse him

1039
01:28:54,192 --> 01:28:56,014
against me!

1040
01:29:13,072 --> 01:29:14,000
You...

1041
01:29:14,032 --> 01:29:16,072
you must learn to avoid

1042
01:29:16,144 --> 01:29:19,046
putting me in a passion...

1043
01:29:19,120 --> 01:29:21,487
or I shall really murder you
sometime.

1044
01:29:54,319 --> 01:29:56,229
Come back and finish
your dinner.

1045
01:29:58,159 --> 01:30:00,679
Go home.

1046
01:30:00,720 --> 01:30:02,629
You've other company.

1047
01:30:06,543 --> 01:30:09,991
I don't know how you
can bear to leave her.

1048
01:30:30,255 --> 01:30:32,938
How can you defend him?

1049
01:30:32,975 --> 01:30:35,495
He's robbed you
of Wuthering Heights.

1050
01:30:35,535 --> 01:30:38,088
Your name's
above the door.

1051
01:30:39,694 --> 01:30:42,694
Doesn't matter.

1052
01:30:42,735 --> 01:30:45,604
If he were the deviI himself,
it wouldn't matter.

1053
01:30:48,590 --> 01:30:51,340
How would you feeI

1054
01:30:51,374 --> 01:30:53,741
if I spoke badly of your father?

1055
01:30:53,775 --> 01:30:56,109
Heathcliff's not your father.

1056
01:30:56,143 --> 01:30:58,761
He's my true father.

1057
01:31:00,654 --> 01:31:03,589
It's a poor conclusion,
is it not?

1058
01:31:05,743 --> 01:31:07,815
My old enemies
have not beaten me.

1059
01:31:07,854 --> 01:31:10,156
Now would be the precise time

1060
01:31:10,191 --> 01:31:12,678
to revenge myself
on their children.

1061
01:31:17,390 --> 01:31:19,299
I could do it.

1062
01:31:20,910 --> 01:31:23,757
No one could hinder me.

1063
01:31:26,478 --> 01:31:28,550
But where's the use?

1064
01:31:28,589 --> 01:31:30,477
Eat it while it's hot.

1065
01:31:41,294 --> 01:31:42,635
Oh, for God's sake,

1066
01:31:42,670 --> 01:31:44,775
please don't keep staring
like that.

1067
01:31:47,949 --> 01:31:49,705
Turn round.

1068
01:31:51,310 --> 01:31:54,179
Tell me, are we by ourselves?

1069
01:32:08,333 --> 01:32:11,181
Heathcliff...

1070
01:32:11,213 --> 01:32:12,969
you've not had a Bible
in your hand

1071
01:32:13,005 --> 01:32:14,499
since you were a lad.

1072
01:32:15,501 --> 01:32:18,567
Let me fetch the parson.

1073
01:32:18,605 --> 01:32:21,126
There's a strange...

1074
01:32:21,165 --> 01:32:23,402
change approaching.

1075
01:32:27,693 --> 01:32:28,970
How do you mean-

1076
01:32:29,005 --> 01:32:31,209
a change?

1077
01:32:31,244 --> 01:32:33,317
It's been a long fight.

1078
01:32:38,445 --> 01:32:41,227
I wish it were over.

1079
01:33:11,020 --> 01:33:12,264
Cathy?

1080
01:33:31,212 --> 01:33:33,100
Eh...

1081
01:33:42,764 --> 01:33:44,389
Mr. Heathcliff?

1082
01:33:44,428 --> 01:33:46,468
You'll have to wait.

1083
01:34:16,779 --> 01:34:18,208
Who are you?

1084
01:34:18,252 --> 01:34:20,673
I- I'm Lockwood.

1085
01:34:20,715 --> 01:34:22,090
Your new tenant
up at the Grange.

1086
01:34:22,123 --> 01:34:24,425
I'm surprised
you'd choose a storm

1087
01:34:24,459 --> 01:34:26,499
to go wandering about in,
Mr. Lockwood.

1088
01:34:57,514 --> 01:34:59,424
Who the deviI put you in there?

1089
01:34:59,467 --> 01:35:00,481
The deviI is right.

1090
01:35:02,507 --> 01:35:04,579
She said she'd been walking
the earth for 20 years.

1091
01:35:04,650 --> 01:35:07,465
Catherine Linton,
or Earnshaw,

1092
01:35:07,530 --> 01:35:09,418
or whatever she's called.

1093
01:35:09,450 --> 01:35:11,239
Her face.

1094
01:35:12,842 --> 01:35:15,264
She looked like...

1095
01:35:15,306 --> 01:35:18,405
Oh, you should not
have gone in there.

1096
01:35:24,234 --> 01:35:26,820
Will you come with me?

1097
01:35:26,858 --> 01:35:29,793
No.

1098
01:35:29,834 --> 01:35:33,511
To you, I've made myself
worse than the deviI.

1099
01:38:10,568 --> 01:38:13,437
Together, they are afraid
of nothing.

1100
01:38:13,479 --> 01:38:17,571
They would brave Satan
and all his legions.

1101
01:38:35,527 --> 01:38:37,502
And the price?

1102
01:38:39,463 --> 01:38:42,976
Three graves by a low wall

1103
01:38:43,015 --> 01:38:45,054
where the churchyard
meets the open moor.

1104
01:38:45,095 --> 01:38:49,218
A generation lost and gone.

1105
01:38:49,287 --> 01:38:55,877
Edgar, Cathy, Heathcliff.

01:38:55,942 --> 01:39:00,798
May they sleep sound
in that quiet earth.

1107
01:39:00,839 --> 01:39:05,411
But country folk
will swear on their Bibles

1108
01:39:05,446 --> 01:39:07,334
that he still walks.
