00:01:18,067 --> 00:01:21,136
So, meiosis is the process
by which a cell divides

6
00:01:21,203 --> 00:01:23,471
and splits up
the number of chromosomes.

7
00:01:23,538 --> 00:01:25,840
Now, this is different
than mitosis, remember.

8
00:01:25,908 --> 00:01:29,011
They are to form what are called
gametes, alright?

9
00:01:29,078 --> 00:01:30,678
Did this make sense
to everybody?

10
00:01:30,745 --> 00:01:32,613
Alright now, each gamete
contains 50 percent..

00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,050
We're just gonna
like, wreck your house.

00:01:35,117 --> 00:01:37,353

- Who's even coming?

00:01:37,419 --> 00:01:40,621
Yeah, is it gonna be like, super
exclusive? What's the deal?

It's a back to school party,

Sara can even bring her
D-and-D BFF for all I care.

00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:50,698
They combine to form...

18
00:01:50,765 --> 00:01:53,302
We're not even friends anymore

19
00:01:53,369 --> 00:01:55,603

it was magic.

(Mr. Rubin)
'Uh, yes, Hayley?'

21
00:01:59,942 --> 00:02:03,578
Amoebas and stuff can

22
00:02:03,644 --> 00:02:06,148
- Like asexually?
- Mm, that's right.

23
00:02:06,215 --> 00:02:07,548
So if that works, then why

24
00:02:07,615 --> 00:02:09,418
is sexual reproduction
even a thing?

25
00:02:09,485 --> 00:02:12,154
Uh, 'cause it's super fun?

26
00:02:12,221 --> 00:02:15,457

that's a terrific question.

Amy's supes embarrassed about it

182
00:12:36,478 --> 00:12:38,813
and made me promise
not to tell anyone

183
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,615
also she pegged him.

184
00:12:40,682 --> 00:12:42,183
So, what's up?

185
00:12:44,152 --> 00:12:45,387
[sighs]

186
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:58,134
So, why are you here?

187
00:12:58,199 --> 00:13:01,003
Uh, hello?

188
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:03,772
Okay, I'm just trying to like

189
00:13:03,838 --> 00:13:05,407
like, where's Kiana?

190
00:13:05,473 --> 00:13:06,942
Aren't you guys like,
besties now?

191
00:13:07,009 --> 00:13:10,913
I mean, I just thought
you would help me or whatever.

192
00:13:12,847 --> 00:13:14,783
What?

193
00:13:14,849 --> 00:13:17,452
Nothing, you just

194
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:20,555
kinda totally ghosted me
sophomore year.

195
00:13:20,622 --> 00:13:23,658
What?
I've seen you.

196
00:13:25,226 --> 00:13:27,195
Whatever, never mind.

197
00:13:27,262 --> 00:13:28,763
Hayley,
I'm really freaking here.

198
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:32,902
Well, sorry, it's just,
a lot to take in.

199
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:37,439
- Shyeah.
- It doesn't make sense.

200
00:13:37,505 --> 00:13:38,873
I saw you yesterday.

201
00:13:38,941 --> 00:13:41,476
Puking my guts out.
Morning sickness much?

202
00:13:41,543 --> 00:13:43,445
Okay, well, whatever's
happening here is...

203
00:13:43,511 --> 00:13:45,915
Completely bat-shit.

204
00:13:45,981 --> 00:13:47,449
Gynecological.

205
00:13:47,515 --> 00:13:49,217
You need to go to a hospital!

206
00:13:49,284 --> 00:13:51,153
Hmm, veto.
They'll call my mom.

207
00:13:51,219 --> 00:13:53,089
Oh, are you serious?

208
00:13:53,155 --> 00:13:54,355
This is triage, Hayley.

209
00:13:54,422 --> 00:13:57,225
Priority one
is keeping this quiet.

210
00:13:57,292 --> 00:14:01,229
Priority two is my health
and general overall wellbeing.

211
00:14:02,764 --> 00:14:05,767
Okay, so you want a place
that's confidential

212
00:14:05,834 --> 00:14:07,970
maybe who knows a way around
a freaky surprise pregnancy

213
00:14:08,037 --> 00:14:10,705
and, hey, hopefully doesn't
cost anything either

214
00:14:10,772 --> 00:14:12,440
because why not?

215
00:14:16,277 --> 00:14:20,149
We're all human beings
in God's eyes.

216
00:14:20,216 --> 00:14:22,450
It is not too late
to turn around.

217
00:14:22,517 --> 00:14:25,453
'There is still time
for forgiveness.'

218
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,322
Don't make a decision
you'll regret

219
00:14:27,388 --> 00:14:29,324
for the rest of your life.

220
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:30,425
Forgive this harlot, Lord.

221
00:14:30,492 --> 00:14:33,162
She knows not what she does.

222
00:14:33,229 --> 00:14:35,430
Jesus loves you!

223
00:14:38,134 --> 00:14:39,634
Bitch!

224
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:58,154
I guess those opium orgies
really paid off, huh?

225
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:00,222
Okay, I told you
it was my first time

226
00:15:00,288 --> 00:15:03,324
so stop slut shaming me.

227
00:15:03,391 --> 00:15:05,560
And sex is like,
a totally natural

228
00:15:05,627 --> 00:15:07,762
healthy part of life anyway.

229
00:15:10,199 --> 00:15:12,500
Where is Skyler, anyway?

230
00:15:14,136 --> 00:15:16,437
- You should call him...
- Don't!

231
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,042
It's not Skyler.

232
00:15:22,877 --> 00:15:25,513
That's the whole reason
we broke up in the first place.

233
00:15:26,215 --> 00:15:27,849
I wanted to wait.

234
00:15:29,018 --> 00:15:31,220
Oh, that's probably good.

235
00:15:31,287 --> 00:15:34,322
Skyler was always kind of a
sleaze anyway.

236
00:15:34,389 --> 00:15:37,325
And cocky, and a douche.

237
00:15:39,094 --> 00:15:41,563
- Oh, my God, was it Joey C.?
- It doesn't..

238
00:15:41,629 --> 00:15:43,265
Hayley, it doesn't matter.

239
00:15:43,331 --> 00:15:46,969
Would you just lay off,
please?

240
00:15:47,036 --> 00:15:50,471
I just don't understand
why you dragged me

241
00:15:50,538 --> 00:15:52,707
into this instead of..

242
00:15:54,043 --> 00:15:55,543
...Mark?

243
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:57,378
I'm gonna get back
to this questionnaire

244
00:15:57,445 --> 00:16:00,348
because it's slightly less
invasive.

245
00:16:06,721 --> 00:16:09,058
So, how far along are you?

246
00:16:09,925 --> 00:16:11,426
A day.

247
00:16:12,627 --> 00:16:15,965
And I know that sounds like,
super cray.

248
00:16:16,031 --> 00:16:19,301
Sara, you didn't just like,
go to sleep last night

249
00:16:19,367 --> 00:16:21,103
and wake up
nine months pregnant.

250
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:26,608
It's pretty cray.

251
00:16:26,674 --> 00:16:29,144
[instrumental music]

252
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:37,819
I am so effed.

253
00:16:37,886 --> 00:16:39,387
No.

254
00:16:39,454 --> 00:16:41,123
I'm sure Zack will
still support you.

255
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:44,692
[laughs]
Not having this convo, again.

256
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:46,262
I'm just, I'm just confused.

257
00:16:46,328 --> 00:16:48,396
You know, I thought you wanted
to wait for this sort of thing.

258
00:16:48,463 --> 00:16:49,530
I mean,
isn't that the whole reason

259
00:16:49,597 --> 00:16:50,698
why you broke up
with that man slut?

260
00:16:50,765 --> 00:16:52,567
Skyler's not a man slut.

261
00:16:55,104 --> 00:16:56,738
He was all tan.

262
00:16:56,804 --> 00:16:57,572
Yuck!

263
00:16:57,639 --> 00:16:59,975
He just got back from Mexico.

264
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,813
(both)
Mexico?

265
00:17:11,287 --> 00:17:13,956
Wait, what is..

266
00:17:18,327 --> 00:17:19,861
Oh, God!

267
00:17:22,097 --> 00:17:23,865
Um, yeah.

268
00:17:23,933 --> 00:17:25,167
Um, okay.

269
00:17:26,434 --> 00:17:28,803
I'll be right back.

270
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:30,973
I'm sure everything's fine.

271
00:17:36,078 --> 00:17:38,213
I'm gonna go get a doctor.

272
00:17:39,714 --> 00:17:41,183
I need you to look.

273
00:17:43,085 --> 00:17:44,353
I hate you.

Whoa, okay! That was way more
butt hole than I was expecting!

277
00:17:58,334 --> 00:18:02,837
Don't be such a prude!
Come on, is it like, crowning?

278
00:18:02,905 --> 00:18:04,039
Gah!

What the hell?

281
00:18:13,382 --> 00:18:15,650
I think that was a contraction.

tell me she was in labor.'

are the contractions?

286
00:18:23,158 --> 00:18:24,559
Very close!

287
00:18:24,625 --> 00:18:26,061
We need to do this now.

288
00:18:26,128 --> 00:18:28,529
Richard, Richard!

289
00:18:28,596 --> 00:18:30,466
Richard, I'm telling you

290
00:18:30,531 --> 00:18:32,500
there is something weird
on that sonogram.

291
00:18:32,567 --> 00:18:34,269
That's why I'm here.

292
00:18:35,737 --> 00:18:37,373
Ew, no, no, no!

293
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:38,873
- Can't she do it?
- 'Yeah.'

294
00:18:38,941 --> 00:18:41,343
I mean, there's like,
a lot of butt hole.

295
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:42,945
Miss, I'm an OB-GYN.

296

Not a baby.

303

- No duh!
- Yeah, no duh. No duh!

304
00:19:24,585 --> 00:19:25,921
This is why
you use a condom.

00:23:22,391 --> 00:23:25,093
Dude, he knows something,
remember?

361
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,461
Mexico?

362
00:23:26,528 --> 00:23:29,830
That was a brief lapse
of xenophobia.

363
00:23:29,898 --> 00:23:31,466
I don't want him getting
involved in this.

364
00:23:31,533 --> 00:23:32,800
You don't understand.

365
00:23:32,867 --> 00:23:34,469
Yeah, no, I don't!

366
00:23:35,737 --> 00:23:37,805
He'll freak out and I don't..

367
00:23:37,872 --> 00:23:39,941
And, hi, the vag cannon
thing again.

368
00:23:40,008 --> 00:23:41,376
Oh, whatever!

369
00:23:41,443 --> 00:23:42,411
Okay, don't get huffy.

370
00:23:42,477 --> 00:23:43,878
We're still exploring.

371
00:23:43,945 --> 00:23:45,914
Okay, okay, okay.

372
00:23:45,981 --> 00:23:48,116
How tall is your staircase?

373
00:23:48,183 --> 00:23:49,284
Wow.

374
00:23:49,351 --> 00:23:50,652
We are really scraping
the bottom

375
00:23:50,719 --> 00:23:52,354
of the idea barrel here.

376
00:23:52,421 --> 00:23:54,589
How 'bout we just slap you
on the kitchen counter

377
00:23:54,656 --> 00:23:56,491
and aim you at the Vitamix?

378
00:24:05,267 --> 00:24:07,835
This better be the last time
I see that butt hole tonight.

379
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:16,945

Okay, love you too.

00:25:36,491 --> 00:25:39,194
- It's not coming out.
- Try pushing.

392
00:25:39,261 --> 00:25:42,364
If I push any harder
I'm gonna shit on the counter.

393
00:25:42,431 --> 00:25:44,499
Ugh!

394
00:25:44,566 --> 00:25:48,804
I can't find anything about
a Mexican pregnancy monster.

00:25:54,643 --> 00:25:58,747
You know, I think if this
is a thing people knew about

398
00:25:58,814 --> 00:26:01,082
we'd know, you know?

Hey!

00:26:14,996 --> 00:26:16,998
Holy crap, sweetie!

405
00:26:17,065 --> 00:26:18,099
Give me a hug!

406
00:26:18,166 --> 00:26:21,303
Oh, let me come to you!

407
00:26:23,472 --> 00:26:25,040
Oh!

408
00:26:25,106 --> 00:26:28,076
I haven't seen you
in forever and a day.

409
00:26:28,143 --> 00:26:29,511
You look so..

410
00:26:29,578 --> 00:26:32,614
Oh, my God,
you look like a grownup.

411
00:26:32,681 --> 00:26:35,984
And-and you're doing that
school thing, which is awesome!

- Bathroom.

Ha! Story of her life.

416
00:26:48,597 --> 00:26:52,067
Oh, it is just so good
to see you.

417
00:26:52,133 --> 00:26:53,702
I know, oh!

418
00:26:56,505 --> 00:26:58,874
It is just,
it is so good

419
00:26:58,941 --> 00:27:00,075
to see you two
hanging out again.

420
00:27:00,141 --> 00:27:01,543
Yeah!

421
00:27:01,610 --> 00:27:04,012
[sighs] I don't know what
is up with her lately

422
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:08,717
but she just seems kinda,
uh, ugh

423
00:27:08,783 --> 00:27:10,418
uh, you know?

424
00:27:10,485 --> 00:27:11,753
Really?

425
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:13,588
No.

426
00:27:13,655 --> 00:27:15,892
Oh, I don't know.

427
00:27:15,958 --> 00:27:17,192
I feel like
I'm losing my sweet girl

428
00:27:17,259 --> 00:27:20,529
to this person
I don't recognize.

429
00:27:22,731 --> 00:27:26,201
I totally didn't notice.

430
00:27:26,268 --> 00:27:28,603
Well, you've always had
your head screwed on straight.

431
00:27:28,670 --> 00:27:30,338
Sara's head is up her ass.

432
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:33,241
Well, I'm off!

433
00:27:34,109 --> 00:27:35,810
Bye, Sara, be good!

434
00:27:39,481 --> 00:27:41,116
Okay, she's gone for now,
but we cannot

435
00:27:41,182 --> 00:27:43,318
stick around here forever.
Any changes?

436
00:27:43,385 --> 00:27:45,253
No, it's not coming out.

437
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:47,622
So, what do we do?
Just like, wait?

438
00:27:47,689 --> 00:27:50,158
I can't just Juno around town
with this thing.

439
00:27:50,225 --> 00:27:52,093
We gotta get proactive.

440
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:54,162
Okay, um..

00:27:54,229 --> 00:27:56,765

this cabin tour once

449

and one of the alpacas,
she was like, three weeks late

450
00:28:15,952 --> 00:28:19,220
and Dave shot this stuff into
her that made her give birth.

451
00:28:19,287 --> 00:28:21,389
Yeah, but that's an animal.

452
00:28:21,456 --> 00:28:23,325
Exactly!

453
00:28:23,391 --> 00:28:25,027
He's not gonna believe us.

454
00:28:25,093 --> 00:28:27,562
Or we could call the cops?

456
00:28:36,137 --> 00:28:37,706
Yowza.

457
00:28:40,275 --> 00:28:42,577
Hey dispatch,
we're gonna need an ambulance.

458
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:47,449
And the coroner.

459
00:28:51,519 --> 00:28:56,224
Just try not to leak
on anything back there.

460
00:28:56,291 --> 00:28:59,761
Yeah, I wouldn't wanna
ruin your stunning upholstery.

461
00:28:59,828 --> 00:29:01,563
Hey, I just
thought of something.

462
00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:02,965
(Sara)
'Yeah?'

463
00:29:03,032 --> 00:29:06,701
We've left that thingy
in the clinic, right?

464
00:29:06,768 --> 00:29:09,371
- Uh-huh?
- Well, like, oops, right?

465
00:29:09,437 --> 00:29:11,740
It could hurt more people.

466
00:29:11,806 --> 00:29:16,012
Maybe he's... dead?

467
00:29:16,078 --> 00:29:18,213
[dramatic music]

468
00:29:23,652 --> 00:29:25,253
Yeah.

469
00:29:27,089 --> 00:29:29,190
But probably not, right?

470
00:29:30,525 --> 00:29:32,928
Maybe he's just, like..

471
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:36,765
...chilling at the clinic.

But probably not, right?

475
00:29:50,046 --> 00:29:51,379
Hmm.

476
00:29:52,414 --> 00:29:55,750
Okay, let's deal with this guy

477
00:29:55,817 --> 00:29:58,020
and then we'll go back.

478
00:29:58,087 --> 00:30:02,424
Yeah, if we don't die,
we won't definitely go back.

00:30:07,195 --> 00:30:08,730

- Hayley?
- Hey.

485
00:30:45,533 --> 00:30:48,369
I, uh, did I call you in?

486
00:30:48,436 --> 00:30:51,539
No, but we kinda
need your help.

487
00:30:53,808 --> 00:30:56,478
Sara Steinberg?

488
00:30:56,544 --> 00:30:59,547
Come out here,
let me take a look at you!

489
00:31:05,988 --> 00:31:09,457
So, Sara had sex with some guy
and got pregnant overnight

490
00:31:09,524 --> 00:31:11,060
and we went to the clinic,
but she gave birth

491
00:31:11,127 --> 00:31:14,163
to this weird thing
and it exploded a doctor's head

492
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:16,498
and controlled a nurse like
a puppet with its stinger

493
00:31:16,564 --> 00:31:18,666
and now she has another one
inside of her

494
00:31:18,733 --> 00:31:21,070
and we need to get it out.

495
00:31:21,137 --> 00:31:23,705
And we know
that sounds super cray.

496
00:31:26,407 --> 00:31:29,677
It's a parasite,
a dracunculus

497
00:31:29,744 --> 00:31:32,580
or a blood fluke or something.

498
00:31:32,647 --> 00:31:34,482
Ugh, a blood fluke?

499
00:31:34,549 --> 00:31:37,352
Yeah, it's a type of flatworm.

500
00:31:37,418 --> 00:31:39,021
This is hot.

501
00:31:39,088 --> 00:31:40,855
So, I have worms?

502
00:31:40,923 --> 00:31:43,092
No, no, no, no.

503
00:31:43,159 --> 00:31:46,528
What you have
is much freakier than that.

504
00:31:46,594 --> 00:31:48,630
So what kind of parasite
can just hijack

505
00:31:48,696 --> 00:31:49,999
a human reproductive system?

506
00:31:50,065 --> 00:31:52,500
Or a whole human,
while we're at it.

507
00:31:52,567 --> 00:31:54,469
Well, I can consult
my literature

508
00:31:54,536 --> 00:31:56,371
but I'm pretty sure

509
00:31:56,437 --> 00:31:58,473
I haven't heard
anything like this before.

510
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:03,344
I mean, Sara, you may have
discovered a whole new species.

511
00:32:03,411 --> 00:32:04,712
Goodie.

512
00:32:06,148 --> 00:32:08,850
This guy you got down with

513
00:32:08,918 --> 00:32:11,187
had he altered
his routine at all?

514
00:32:11,253 --> 00:32:14,290
Gone spelunking,
eaten something gnarly?

515
00:32:14,355 --> 00:32:16,624
Been bitten by a rabid dog?

516
00:32:16,691 --> 00:32:18,961
Well, he did just come back
from Mexico.

517
00:32:19,028 --> 00:32:20,495
Mexico?

518
00:32:22,564 --> 00:32:25,333
Not in an ethnocentric way
or anything

519
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:28,971
but... maybe lover boy
came back

520
00:32:29,038 --> 00:32:31,974
with an illegal alien?

521
00:32:32,041 --> 00:32:33,976

522
00:32:35,743 --> 00:32:36,878
Whoa.

523
00:32:38,314 --> 00:32:40,983
Whoa indeed, caballero.

524
00:32:42,251 --> 00:32:43,885
Whoa indeed.

525
00:32:46,322 --> 00:32:48,723
Whatever, you can get it
out of me, right?

526
00:32:50,391 --> 00:32:51,994
Probably.

527
00:32:52,061 --> 00:32:54,897
Hey, I checked on that Steinberg
address, no one was home.

528
00:32:54,964 --> 00:32:57,465
Any news on that corpse?

00:32:57,532 --> 00:32:59,701

00:33:55,090 --> 00:33:56,624
It's still here.

535
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:01,997
I completely forgot about this.

536
00:34:02,064 --> 00:34:03,598
Do you think he knows?

538
00:34:09,570 --> 00:34:13,708

00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:26,854
Hey, boo!

542
00:34:26,922 --> 00:34:28,357
(Skyler) You totally
didn't respond to my texts!

543
00:34:28,424 --> 00:34:29,824
Are we rolling to
Kiana's together or not?

544
00:34:29,892 --> 00:34:32,460
Oh, my God,
I completely forgot, Sky.

545
00:34:32,527 --> 00:34:33,761
We talked this morning.

546
00:34:33,828 --> 00:34:37,066
I know I just,
I got this stomach bug

547
00:34:37,132 --> 00:34:38,866
all of a sudden.

548
00:34:41,569 --> 00:34:43,038
I miss you.

549
00:34:43,105 --> 00:34:44,772
Yeah, yeah,
that's fine, whatever.

550
00:34:44,839 --> 00:34:47,575
Um, I'm sorry you're sick.

551
00:34:47,642 --> 00:34:49,577
- Thanks.
- It's just..

552
00:34:49,644 --> 00:34:51,413
I just really
wanna see you, you know?

553
00:34:51,479 --> 00:34:54,816
And I wanna, I wanna kiss you
and I wanna be with you.

554
00:34:54,882 --> 00:34:57,086
- Mm.
- Sexually.

555
00:34:57,152 --> 00:34:58,153
Oh.

556
00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:00,189
I just really
wanna see you tonight!

557
00:35:00,255 --> 00:35:04,126
Yeah, I-I know, but I think
it'll be out of my system soon.

558
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:06,962
I love you!

559
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:09,431
What?

560
00:35:09,497 --> 00:35:11,166
I fucking love you, girl.

561
00:35:11,233 --> 00:35:13,268
'I love you!'

562
00:35:13,335 --> 00:35:14,937
Wow.

563
00:35:15,004 --> 00:35:16,804
Okay, I get it,
you're sick, bye!

564
00:35:20,508 --> 00:35:22,945
- That was weird.
- Huh?

565
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:30,152
He was just acting
super weird. I don't know.

566
00:35:30,219 --> 00:35:34,223
- Sara, you gotta tell him.
- Are you kidding?

567
00:35:34,289 --> 00:35:36,458
We are almost home free,
why would I tell him?

568
00:35:36,524 --> 00:35:39,761
Oh, my God,
like 100 reasons!

569
00:35:39,827 --> 00:35:41,263
How do we know that
he still doesn't have something

570
00:35:41,330 --> 00:35:43,765
inside of him, in his nards?

571
00:35:43,831 --> 00:35:45,833
Uh, 'cause it's inside me now.

572
00:35:45,901 --> 00:35:47,403
Okay, or, you know,
how 'bout the fact

573
00:35:47,469 --> 00:35:49,471
that the father should step up,
maybe?

574
00:35:49,537 --> 00:35:51,839
Why does Skyler
get a free pass?

575
00:35:51,907 --> 00:35:54,309
You're perpetuating some
serious patriarchal bullshit.

576
00:35:54,376 --> 00:35:56,811
This is not the time
for a free the nipple uprising.

577
00:35:56,878 --> 00:36:00,315
Sorry, but this all
started with Skyler, right?

578
00:36:01,682 --> 00:36:04,286
What am I missing?

579
00:36:04,353 --> 00:36:05,653
You've never had a boyfriend.

580
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,789
You wouldn't understand.

581
00:36:17,598 --> 00:36:19,134
Ready?

582
00:36:19,201 --> 00:36:21,136
[intense music]

583
00:36:27,775 --> 00:36:30,345
You okay?

584
00:36:30,412 --> 00:36:34,582
Uh, sure. I've just never done
this on a human before.

585
00:36:37,252 --> 00:36:38,686
Uh..

586
00:36:39,754 --> 00:36:41,823
Sorry, it's gotta reach
the uterus.

587
00:36:42,824 --> 00:36:45,760
Uterotonic
can induce contractions

588
00:36:45,827 --> 00:36:47,996
and ultimately labor.

589
00:36:48,063 --> 00:36:50,933
- Uh-huh.
- 40cc's..

590
00:36:52,534 --> 00:36:54,136
A little more.

591
00:36:58,273 --> 00:36:59,841
Little more.

592
00:37:03,345 --> 00:37:04,913
Oh, baby.

593
00:37:08,716 --> 00:37:10,252
Okay.

594
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:15,357
[intense music]

595
00:37:17,392 --> 00:37:18,726
[exhales]

596
00:37:22,231 --> 00:37:23,932
Here we go.

597
00:37:25,134 --> 00:37:26,401
[gasps]

598
00:37:42,918 --> 00:37:45,387
[music continues]

599
00:37:48,023 --> 00:37:51,160
[breathing heavily]

600
00:37:52,827 --> 00:37:55,364
[whirring]

601
00:38:04,506 --> 00:38:06,441
[gasping]

602
00:38:13,549 --> 00:38:15,117
- Push!
- I did.

603
00:38:15,184 --> 00:38:17,653
- Push harder!
- Why didn't it work?

604
00:38:17,718 --> 00:38:19,887
- Dave!
- I don't know, it should've.

605
00:38:19,955 --> 00:38:22,024
It must've hung on.

606
00:38:22,090 --> 00:38:24,759
You-you're saying
it wants to stay inside?

607
00:38:24,825 --> 00:38:26,861
The uterotonic, give me more!

608
00:38:26,929 --> 00:38:29,398
- I can't!
- Why not?

609
00:38:29,464 --> 00:38:31,667
Because this is dangerous stuff

610
00:38:31,732 --> 00:38:33,202
and if I gave any more

611
00:38:33,268 --> 00:38:36,271
it would risk terminating
the pregnancy altogether.

612
00:38:37,906 --> 00:38:40,008
I realized what I said

613
00:38:40,075 --> 00:38:41,842
as soon as it came out
of my mouth.

614
00:38:41,910 --> 00:38:43,912
I'll get some more.

615
00:38:46,615 --> 00:38:48,716
God, why would it
want to stay inside?

616
00:38:48,783 --> 00:38:51,119
Maybe it's waiting
for something.

617
00:38:52,287 --> 00:38:53,388
For what?

618
00:38:53,455 --> 00:38:57,326
[door banging]

619
00:38:57,392 --> 00:38:58,627
The other guy?

620
00:38:58,694 --> 00:39:00,828
[intense music]

621
00:39:03,899 --> 00:39:06,034
[knock on door]

622
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:15,077
Oh, fart.

623
00:39:15,143 --> 00:39:17,145
Hey, me and Harris, and Alyssa

624
00:39:17,212 --> 00:39:19,780
we're going down to Toto's
for some margaritas!

625
00:39:19,847 --> 00:39:22,184
- Ooh! Ooh!
- Are you interested?

626
00:39:22,251 --> 00:39:25,387
Oh, that sounds amazing,
but I think I'm gonna go home

627
00:39:25,454 --> 00:39:27,322
and get ignored
by my daughter instead.

628
00:39:27,389 --> 00:39:29,324
[laughs]

629
00:39:30,825 --> 00:39:32,394
Alright, well,
I'm gonna go get drunk.

630
00:39:32,461 --> 00:39:35,197
Okay. You have fun!

631
00:39:36,465 --> 00:39:38,166
Be safe!

632
00:39:43,372 --> 00:39:45,307
[phone vibrates]

633
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:52,813
Hello?

634
00:39:53,848 --> 00:39:55,250
What?

635
00:39:56,518 --> 00:39:58,053
What?

636
00:39:59,755 --> 00:40:00,922
She's what?

637
00:40:02,524 --> 00:40:04,993
[intense music]

638
00:40:19,975 --> 00:40:21,476
[screeches]

639
00:40:21,543 --> 00:40:23,145
(Kate)
'I can't even believe you.'

640
00:40:23,211 --> 00:40:24,812
'I literally
cannot believe you!'

641
00:40:24,879 --> 00:40:25,981
Mom, it's not what you think.

642
00:40:26,048 --> 00:40:27,349
After everything we talked about

643
00:40:27,416 --> 00:40:29,718
you go and you have
unprotected sex?

644
00:40:29,785 --> 00:40:31,553
- You're not listening!
- She did, but...

645
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:34,022
- Stay out of this, Hayley!
- It was one time!

646
00:40:34,089 --> 00:40:35,490
One's enough, Sara!

647
00:40:35,557 --> 00:40:38,093
- Obviously, forget college.
- Okay, ma'am, uh...

648
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:40,162
Oh, you see these shows
where the girl gets pregnant

649
00:40:40,228 --> 00:40:41,797
and the mom doesn't notice
anything.

650
00:40:41,862 --> 00:40:43,165
How could you not notice?

651
00:40:43,231 --> 00:40:45,233
And here I am,
and I didn't notice.

652
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:47,069
How couldn't I have noticed?

653
00:40:47,135 --> 00:40:49,137
Ma'am, I need to ask the
girls some questions about...

654
00:40:49,204 --> 00:40:51,173
Christ, Sare Bear. How could you
do this to yourself?

655
00:40:51,239 --> 00:40:54,042
- Oh, you're one to talk.
- Excuse me, young lady?

656
00:40:54,109 --> 00:40:57,145
- Don't young lady me.
- We're like, 15 years apart.

657
00:40:57,212 --> 00:41:01,116
Yes, Sara, I was just like you
and I screwed up my life!

658
00:41:01,183 --> 00:41:05,153
Okay, let's just, uh,
downshift here for a second.

659
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:07,222
Ah, ma'am, do you wanna
step out with me?

660
00:41:07,289 --> 00:41:08,924
- But there's an alien...
- Alien. Right, I know.

661
00:41:08,990 --> 00:41:10,592
Ah, I don't believe you.

662
00:41:15,197 --> 00:41:17,632
- Hi.
- Uh, hi.

663
00:41:17,699 --> 00:41:19,668
You're being allowed
in that room as a courtesy.

664
00:41:19,735 --> 00:41:21,470
I have your daughter
at the scene of a serious crime

665
00:41:21,536 --> 00:41:23,171
and what you're doing right now,
it's not helping me

666
00:41:23,238 --> 00:41:24,806
and it's definitely not
helping your daughter.

667
00:41:24,872 --> 00:41:26,842
Don't, you don't get
to lecture me.

668
00:41:26,908 --> 00:41:28,844
Who do you think you are,
Officer Ruiz?

669
00:41:28,910 --> 00:41:31,113
You're so off base here,
it's crazy!

670
00:41:34,316 --> 00:41:37,319
You know you're like,
not supposed to touch me, right?

671
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:40,888
This whole thing is effed.

672
00:41:40,956 --> 00:41:44,092
Yeah, it's kinda why

673
00:41:44,159 --> 00:41:46,528
I didn't wanna involve cops
in the first place.

674
00:41:46,595 --> 00:41:50,565
It is not my fault my parents
put a LoJack in my car.

675
00:41:50,632 --> 00:41:53,635
I know. Just saying.

676
00:41:56,638 --> 00:41:58,073
[sighs]

677
00:41:59,975 --> 00:42:03,545
Sorry. It's just..

678
00:42:03,612 --> 00:42:06,381
My mom's so up her ass.

679
00:42:06,448 --> 00:42:09,418
And hey, where does she
get off yelling at you?

680
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:15,090
She's really pulling
a Water Zone 2010, huh?

681
00:42:15,157 --> 00:42:17,626
"I went to get corn dogs
for you girls and you disappear?

682
00:42:17,692 --> 00:42:19,795
I had them
checking the parking lot."

683
00:42:19,861 --> 00:42:23,498
"Our home base
was the towels."

684
00:42:23,565 --> 00:42:25,267
You're scared right now, okay?
I get it.

685
00:42:25,333 --> 00:42:27,636
You're so condescending.
You have no idea what it's like!

686
00:42:27,702 --> 00:42:30,472
I have a daughter too.
She's in Tampa with her mom.

687
00:42:30,539 --> 00:42:34,042
She's only five, but if I were
in your shoes right now

688
00:42:34,109 --> 00:42:36,211
I would also be freaking.

689
00:42:36,278 --> 00:42:37,412
Right.

690
00:42:37,479 --> 00:42:39,080
But your daughter's scared too

691
00:42:39,147 --> 00:42:40,882
and she's fabricating
all of this alien stuff

692
00:42:40,949 --> 00:42:42,717
because she doesn't
wanna be judged.

693
00:42:42,784 --> 00:42:44,886
And the only way we're gonna
get some answers tonight

694
00:42:44,953 --> 00:42:48,590
is if we approach the situation
with understanding, okay?

695
00:42:52,461 --> 00:42:54,897
I'mma get a water.
You want a water?

696
00:42:54,963 --> 00:42:57,466
I mean,
your throat must be raw.

697
00:43:02,103 --> 00:43:05,040
Hey, aren't you supposed to be
helping Ruiz with those girls?

698
00:43:05,106 --> 00:43:07,008
After a cigarette.

699
00:43:07,075 --> 00:43:09,377
You know he said that
two cigarettes ago, right?

700
00:43:09,444 --> 00:43:12,380
- Did I?
- 'This guy.'

701
00:43:12,447 --> 00:43:14,716
[intense music]

702
00:43:30,967 --> 00:43:35,637
Sara... I... was
out of line before.

703
00:43:35,704 --> 00:43:37,339
I overreacted.

704
00:43:39,341 --> 00:43:42,244
I just hate to see you
making the same, ugh..

705
00:43:43,913 --> 00:43:46,181
I'm sorry.

706
00:43:46,248 --> 00:43:48,717
Do you wanna tell me
and this officer what happened?

707
00:43:54,389 --> 00:43:55,690
[sighs]

708
00:43:56,893 --> 00:43:59,327
I got pregnant

709
00:43:59,394 --> 00:44:03,098
and what I gave birth to
was an alien.

710
00:44:03,164 --> 00:44:05,001
Oh, <i>dios mio!</i> What happened
at that clinic, okay?

711
00:44:05,066 --> 00:44:06,401
We've told you
like, a million times!

712
00:44:06,468 --> 00:44:08,837
It's exactly what she said!
It's exactly...

713
00:44:08,905 --> 00:44:11,506
Everyone out, I need
everyone out for a second!

714
00:44:11,573 --> 00:44:13,408
- But...
- Out!

715
00:44:19,147 --> 00:44:21,049
Let's go, you.

716
00:44:33,161 --> 00:44:35,630
[intense music]

717
00:44:40,970 --> 00:44:43,104
[dog barking in distance]

718
00:44:53,882 --> 00:44:56,217
It's just you and me now, baby.

719
00:44:57,586 --> 00:45:01,122
Now, I know
you didn't hurt anyone.

720
00:45:01,189 --> 00:45:02,691
and we'll get that sorted out.

721
00:45:02,757 --> 00:45:08,163
But right now, I just wanna
talk to you about you.

722
00:45:08,229 --> 00:45:09,364
Whatever you're going through...

723
00:45:09,431 --> 00:45:11,466
Mom, you have no idea

724
00:45:11,533 --> 00:45:12,902
what you're talking about.

725
00:45:12,969 --> 00:45:14,169
I know what this feels like.

726
00:45:14,235 --> 00:45:16,371
I went through
the exact same thing.

727
00:45:16,438 --> 00:45:19,708
I just wanna make sure
you're not punishing yourself.

728
00:45:21,911 --> 00:45:24,579
Stop trying to help me!

729
00:45:24,646 --> 00:45:26,581
I don't need
an after school special.

730
00:45:26,648 --> 00:45:29,618
This is fucking worlds apart
from what you went through.

731
00:45:29,684 --> 00:45:32,520
I'm not gonna end up
all sad and lonely

732
00:45:32,587 --> 00:45:35,057
just, Jesus,
you make me wanna scream!

733
00:45:35,123 --> 00:45:37,258
[Frankie screaming]

734
00:45:48,803 --> 00:45:51,239
Frankie, you okay?

735
00:45:51,306 --> 00:45:54,442
[intense music]

736
00:46:02,018 --> 00:46:04,152
[screeching]

737
00:46:04,219 --> 00:46:05,887
Told ya.

738
00:46:08,657 --> 00:46:10,525
[growling]

739
00:46:12,128 --> 00:46:14,295
Sir, are you aware

740
00:46:14,362 --> 00:46:17,198
there's a lobster on your neck?

741
00:46:18,934 --> 00:46:20,869
[low growl]

742
00:46:24,172 --> 00:46:26,307
[screeching]

743
00:46:30,445 --> 00:46:32,580
[guns firing]

744
00:46:43,658 --> 00:46:46,594

745
00:46:50,099 --> 00:46:51,800
[exhales]

746
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:09,884
[all screaming]

747
00:47:12,721 --> 00:47:14,990
Holding cell,
lock yourselves in.

748
00:47:17,126 --> 00:47:18,793
Mom!

749
00:47:20,829 --> 00:47:22,764
[panting]

750
00:47:23,832 --> 00:47:26,202
Wait! Don't come in!

751
00:47:26,267 --> 00:47:28,470
- Dave?
- Just don't look.

752
00:47:28,536 --> 00:47:30,505
I got nervous
and had to deuce.

753
00:47:30,572 --> 00:47:33,541
- Nobody look!
- No one's gonna look.

754
00:47:33,608 --> 00:47:35,610
What the hell is going on, Sara?
What was that thing?

755
00:47:35,677 --> 00:47:37,879
Okay, so Sara had sex
as you know, duh, whatever.

756
00:47:37,947 --> 00:47:39,714
And then that thingy
came flying out of her vagina

757
00:47:39,781 --> 00:47:41,382
like a T-shirt cannon
and started chasing us

758
00:47:41,449 --> 00:47:43,119
and there's a second
one still inside Sara

759
00:47:43,185 --> 00:47:45,620
and the first one wants
the second one for some reason.

760
00:47:45,687 --> 00:47:47,522
- Got it?
- Uh, no.

761
00:47:47,589 --> 00:47:50,159
See, so maybe you
should've listened earlier.

762
00:47:50,226 --> 00:47:52,460
You guys.

763
00:47:55,530 --> 00:47:56,498
What, what's wrong?

764
00:47:56,564 --> 00:47:57,933
That thingy can hop off

765
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,235
and come in through bars.

766
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:00,535
We need a plan.

767
00:48:00,602 --> 00:48:01,636
We don't even know
what it wants.

768
00:48:01,703 --> 00:48:02,938
I've been thinking about that

769
00:48:03,005 --> 00:48:04,039
and I have a theory.

770
00:48:04,106 --> 00:48:05,640
Don't look!

771
00:48:05,707 --> 00:48:07,809
It's tracking you, right?

772
00:48:07,876 --> 00:48:09,377
Freaky deaky stuff.

773
00:48:09,444 --> 00:48:11,579
The question is, why?

774
00:48:11,646 --> 00:48:14,449
Now, this thing and its brother
are communicating

775
00:48:14,516 --> 00:48:16,185
from a great distance

776
00:48:16,252 --> 00:48:19,255
some kinda sonar, like a bat.

777
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:21,790
Maybe radio waves

778
00:48:21,856 --> 00:48:23,792
gamma waves?

779
00:48:23,858 --> 00:48:27,862
No, uh, it's radio waves.
Probably radio waves.

780
00:48:27,930 --> 00:48:30,565
Yeah, science, science, science.
It already found us, Dave.

781
00:48:30,632 --> 00:48:33,102
So, this guy inside of you
is telling his buddy

782
00:48:33,169 --> 00:48:35,204
where you're at, why?

783
00:48:35,271 --> 00:48:36,906
Well, in the animal kingdom

784
00:48:36,972 --> 00:48:41,143
babies generally look
to their mama for one thing.

785
00:48:41,210 --> 00:48:44,113
It wants to breastfeed?

786
00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:47,515
It more wants to feed feed

787
00:48:47,582 --> 00:48:49,952
in general on you.

788
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:52,887
Sorry.

789
00:48:55,723 --> 00:48:59,627
- But..
- Way too long a pause, Dave.

790
00:49:01,163 --> 00:49:02,864
The uterotonic is here.

791
00:49:02,932 --> 00:49:05,867
- Utero what, what?
- Mom, shut up!

792
00:49:05,935 --> 00:49:07,468
Where?

793
00:49:07,535 --> 00:49:09,671

Ew!

804
00:50:01,056 --> 00:50:03,391
Oh, my God, you touched it,
you touched it!

Hi.

811
00:50:15,170 --> 00:50:16,804
What the hell are you guys
doing here?

812
00:50:16,871 --> 00:50:19,141
We're going to get
the utero thing, to, um..

813
00:50:20,742 --> 00:50:23,544
I'm not really sure
I understand actually.

814
00:50:24,479 --> 00:50:26,581
[chuckling]

815
00:50:28,449 --> 00:50:29,985
That's funny.

Oh!

Give it at least a 100cc's,
ladies.

823
00:50:56,511 --> 00:50:59,315
- What're you talking about?
- Get to the evidence room.

824
00:50:59,381 --> 00:51:01,250

You awake?

00:54:08,470 --> 00:54:10,005
My mom.

862
00:54:11,473 --> 00:54:13,208
I don't know.

863
00:54:13,275 --> 00:54:15,444
We gotta go find her.

864
00:54:15,511 --> 00:54:17,012
Yeah..

865
00:54:18,046 --> 00:54:20,983

God, you are good at this.

869
00:54:32,928 --> 00:54:34,429
Like really good at this.

870
00:54:34,496 --> 00:54:37,332
It's just hand eye
coordination from gymnastics.

871
00:54:37,399 --> 00:54:40,235
I hate it, but my mom
makes me do it, whatever.

872
00:54:40,302 --> 00:54:41,970
Oh, wow.

873
00:54:42,037 --> 00:54:44,772
She'll be right back.

874
00:54:44,839 --> 00:54:46,375
- Blair.
- Oh, hey!

875
00:54:46,441 --> 00:54:47,509
I told you to wait here for me.

876
00:54:47,576 --> 00:54:48,577
I was just...

877
00:54:48,644 --> 00:54:49,645
I don't care what you were just.

878
00:54:49,710 --> 00:54:51,046
Kick ass party, Kiana.

879
00:54:51,113 --> 00:54:53,848
Thanks, Jess,
you're so fucking sweet.

880
00:54:53,916 --> 00:54:56,451
I love you so much.

881
00:54:56,518 --> 00:54:57,953
Skyler bailed.

882
00:54:58,020 --> 00:55:00,122
Sara obvi called him
and told him to leave.

883
00:55:00,189 --> 00:55:01,822
She's so jealous, it's insane.

884
00:55:01,890 --> 00:55:03,392
Jealous of what?

885
00:55:03,458 --> 00:55:05,260
Me and Skyler's friendship.
We're friends.

886
00:55:05,327 --> 00:55:06,794
We're really,
really good friends.

887
00:55:06,861 --> 00:55:08,063
Like we could take a nap
together and it wouldn't

888
00:55:08,130 --> 00:55:10,098
mean anything,
you know what I mean?

889
00:55:10,165 --> 00:55:13,335
But Sara doesn't get that.
I mean, what's her problem?

890
00:55:13,402 --> 00:55:15,037
She's ruining his life,
he should be here.

891
00:55:15,103 --> 00:55:17,606
You should text him
and tell him to come back.

892
00:55:17,673 --> 00:55:20,976
Jesus, Blair, he's with Sara.

893
00:55:21,043 --> 00:55:23,545
Think before you speak.

894
00:55:23,612 --> 00:55:24,980
This is all so fucked!

895
00:55:25,047 --> 00:55:26,248
Sky, can I please just
talk to Hayley...

896
00:55:26,315 --> 00:55:28,716
I just saw
a bunch of dead cops, Sara!

897
00:55:28,783 --> 00:55:30,219
And I'm like, freaking out!

898
00:55:30,285 --> 00:55:32,720
- She's talking about aliens?
- It's complicated...

899
00:55:32,787 --> 00:55:34,990
This is like,
going to jail shit, Sara.

900
00:55:35,057 --> 00:55:37,259
I need to know what's goin' on!

901
00:55:41,829 --> 00:55:44,967
- We had sex.
- Yeah?

902
00:55:45,033 --> 00:55:47,169
I woke up pregnant.

903
00:55:48,670 --> 00:55:51,373
- Oh shit!
- Ugh!

904
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:52,407
Are you sure?

905
00:55:52,474 --> 00:55:54,409
Then I gave birth

906
00:55:54,476 --> 00:55:56,712
to, um..

907
00:55:56,777 --> 00:55:59,114
...an alien.

908
00:55:59,181 --> 00:56:01,782
- Two aliens.
- Yeah.

909
00:56:02,783 --> 00:56:03,884
And they have my mom

910
00:56:03,952 --> 00:56:06,421
and I don't know where they are

911
00:56:06,488 --> 00:56:08,756
and... I don't know

912
00:56:08,823 --> 00:56:09,992
maybe the..

913
00:56:10,058 --> 00:56:13,929
Maybe you, like, know something?

914
00:56:15,097 --> 00:56:16,999
What the fuck
are you talking about?

915
00:56:17,065 --> 00:56:19,001
I know this is so much
to unload on you

916
00:56:19,067 --> 00:56:20,068
and I'm not like,
blaming you or anything.

917
00:56:20,135 --> 00:56:21,303
But it is definitely your fault.

918
00:56:21,370 --> 00:56:22,938
- Hayley!
- What's your whole thing, man?

919
00:56:23,005 --> 00:56:24,172
- You think I'm an alien?
- I don't know.

920
00:56:24,239 --> 00:56:25,340
That would make sense, right?

921
00:56:25,407 --> 00:56:26,942
You leave town
and come back different.

922
00:56:27,009 --> 00:56:28,377
Hayley, he's not an alien.

923
00:56:28,443 --> 00:56:30,845
You said it yourself at Dave's,
he's acting weird.

924
00:56:30,912 --> 00:56:32,381
- Hayley!
- What is she talking about?

925
00:56:32,447 --> 00:56:33,649
- No, I was just...
- Why are you defending him?

926
00:56:33,715 --> 00:56:34,716
I thought you wanted my help!

927
00:56:34,782 --> 00:56:37,319
Oh, my God, shut up!

00:56:40,855 --> 00:56:42,424
Hayley!

930
00:56:42,491 --> 00:56:46,295
Can I please just
have a second with him?

I don't know, mother,
you know, maybe

937
00:57:33,874 --> 00:57:35,744
maybe I like being single, hmm?

938
00:57:35,811 --> 00:57:37,346
You ever consider that?

939
00:57:37,412 --> 00:57:39,748
After teaching all day,
all I wanna do

940
00:57:39,815 --> 00:57:41,216
is just curl up with a book

941

an-and if I'm indulging

942
00:57:44,119 --> 00:57:45,921
yes, a cookie.

943
00:57:45,987 --> 00:57:47,789
Well, good for Florida.

944
00:57:47,855 --> 00:57:49,825
You know, but here
in the real world

945
00:57:49,891 --> 00:57:51,560
things are a little different.

946
00:57:51,626 --> 00:57:54,229
I mean, it's not like I'm just
gonna bump into the person

947
00:57:54,296 --> 00:57:56,498
I'm gonna spend the rest..
Oh!

948
00:57:56,565 --> 00:57:58,567
Oh, I-I am so sorry.

949
00:57:58,633 --> 00:57:59,768
I will pay for this.

950
00:57:59,835 --> 00:58:01,236

something is going on with you.

to be supportive, God!

You need to tell me
what happened in Mexico.

Nothing,
I just chilled poolside

972
00:59:24,586 --> 00:59:26,923
did that bullshit Spanish
assignment.

It's nothing, okay?
You're just overreacting.

I'm just trying to help.

979
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:50,579
I know, I just..

980
00:59:51,780 --> 00:59:54,316

That piece of shit, I knew it!

You called him out
on that thing and he freaked.

996
01:01:09,691 --> 01:01:11,560
It's gotta mean something.

997
01:01:11,626 --> 01:01:15,163

everything, huh?

Right?

Senorita Thompson
thinks he has dyslexia

1003
01:01:32,814 --> 01:01:35,250
so he's allowed to make
a video essay, I don't know.

1004
01:01:35,317 --> 01:01:37,118
Oh, so maybe there's something
about that thing

I'm looking for.

Yeah, no, I..

Yeah.

you're blaming me?

you kept going after him.

I don't know, we'll, we'll...

and now he's gone!

we're just gonna go back

to break me and Skyler up?

You understand this is why
we're not friends, right?

1055

We're not friends 'cause
you ditched me sophomore year

for yourself.

01:16:38,921 --> 01:16:41,289
- Sara?
- You're alive?

1250
01:16:41,356 --> 01:16:44,593
Oh, yeah, you too? Yay!

1251
01:16:44,659 --> 01:16:46,027
Wait, is that the cop
from the barns?

1252
01:16:46,094 --> 01:16:48,630
- Shut up, Jerome!
- Who's Jerome?

1253
01:16:48,697 --> 01:16:49,998
It doesn't matter.

1254
01:16:50,065 --> 01:16:51,399
- Is my mom there?
- Is your mom there?

1255
01:16:51,466 --> 01:16:54,236
- Wait, what?
- She's not there with you?

1256
01:16:54,302 --> 01:16:56,304
I don't know, she's, uh..

1257
01:16:57,706 --> 01:17:00,242
[intense music]

1258
01:17:01,610 --> 01:17:04,713
We'll take my car.
If we do this, we go hard.

1259
01:17:04,779 --> 01:17:07,482
I can't have you guys chickening
out at the last second.

1260
01:17:08,985 --> 01:17:10,685
Oh, you two little shit..

1261
01:17:10,752 --> 01:17:12,687
[tires screeching]

1262
01:17:22,899 --> 01:17:26,903
Just so you know, I wasn't gonna
shoot the propane. Bad idea.

1263
01:17:26,969 --> 01:17:28,770
I-I didn't even know that you
were in there, obviously

1264
01:17:28,837 --> 01:17:30,405
because then..

1265
01:17:35,343 --> 01:17:37,479
Well, it wouldn't have
killed her.

1266
01:17:40,448 --> 01:17:42,584
Wouldn't have killed her.

1267
01:17:44,119 --> 01:17:46,254
She's gonna be okay.

1268
01:17:52,460 --> 01:17:53,762
Oh!

1269
01:17:55,031 --> 01:17:58,166

[instrumental music]

1274
01:18:25,027 --> 01:18:26,861
What the hell?

1275
01:18:28,229 --> 01:18:30,765
[intense music]

1276
01:18:55,490 --> 01:18:58,860
No, no, I-I don't understand.

1277
01:19:01,363 --> 01:19:04,265
Those things are out there

1278
01:19:04,332 --> 01:19:07,135
and they're gonna eff
and we're screwed.

1279
01:19:08,536 --> 01:19:10,906
You work your whole life
to get in a college

1280
01:19:10,973 --> 01:19:14,643
an-and the world just ends.

1281
01:19:15,610 --> 01:19:18,146
And it doesn't even matter.

1282
01:19:20,548 --> 01:19:24,519
Oh, my God,
I have never been to Japan.

1283
01:19:24,586 --> 01:19:26,855
Holy shit!

1284
01:19:30,059 --> 01:19:33,828
What do these thingies need
to complete their life cycle?

1285
01:19:33,896 --> 01:19:35,330
High school hotties?

1286
01:19:35,397 --> 01:19:37,198
They need people to eff, right?

1287
01:19:37,265 --> 01:19:38,433
- Right?
- Okay.

1288
01:19:38,500 --> 01:19:39,834
So we know
they're looking for sex

1289
01:19:39,902 --> 01:19:41,169
'like, a lot of sex.'

1290
01:19:41,236 --> 01:19:42,837
They're out there right
now sniffing around

1291
01:19:42,905 --> 01:19:45,407
fo-for pheromones or gamma rays
or whatever

1292
01:19:45,473 --> 01:19:47,842
all leading to like..

1293
01:19:47,910 --> 01:19:51,713
- An orgy?
- Yeah! Kind of.

1294
01:19:51,780 --> 01:19:54,349
Well, where are we gonna
find an orgy in Madre Vista?

1295
01:19:54,416 --> 01:19:56,584
You mean like a big,
sweaty group of people

1296
01:19:56,651 --> 01:19:58,853
ready to go to the bone zone?

1297
01:20:00,321 --> 01:20:03,125
- Kiana's party!
- There's a party?

1298
01:20:03,191 --> 01:20:05,260
Oh, yeah, sorry.

1299
01:20:05,326 --> 01:20:06,628
No, it's cool, but, oh, shit!

1300
01:20:06,695 --> 01:20:07,862
Kiana's party,
that's gotta be it.

1301
01:20:07,930 --> 01:20:09,264
We don't have a lot of time

1302
01:20:09,330 --> 01:20:10,799
if the whole party gets gassed
we'll have 100

1303
01:20:10,865 --> 01:20:14,003
Skyler level horndogs
making 200 thingies and..

1304
01:20:14,070 --> 01:20:16,438
Math will happen.

1305
01:20:16,504 --> 01:20:19,441
So, the plan is, get to Kiana's.

1306
01:20:19,507 --> 01:20:21,376
- Evacuate the party.
- Take out the thingies.

1307
01:20:21,443 --> 01:20:24,646
- Stop the baby gas.
- Save my mom.

1308
01:20:24,713 --> 01:20:27,083
Save the world.

1309
01:20:27,149 --> 01:20:28,918
Shit, yeah.

1310
01:20:30,318 --> 01:20:33,455

[tires screeching]

1315
01:21:14,329 --> 01:21:16,899
- Wait, wait, wait!
- What?

1316
01:21:24,639 --> 01:21:26,374
Your butt's kinda hanging out.

1317
01:21:26,441 --> 01:21:28,978
Oh, thanks.

1318
01:21:29,912 --> 01:21:32,847
[instrumental music]

1319
01:21:35,550 --> 01:21:37,752
- Shall we? Okay.
- Yep.

1320
01:21:47,562 --> 01:21:49,330
Uh..

1321
01:21:53,635 --> 01:21:55,037
Aliens!

1322
01:21:59,975 --> 01:22:01,876
Aliens are coming!

1323
01:22:04,246 --> 01:22:06,881
Um, cops!

1324
01:22:06,949 --> 01:22:08,683
Cops, yes!

1325
01:22:08,750 --> 01:22:12,154
Guys, guys, we gotta bail!
5-0 rolling up any minute.

1326
01:22:12,221 --> 01:22:13,521
No, they're not.

1327
01:22:13,588 --> 01:22:14,656
The neighbors have been
calling 'em all night.

1328
01:22:14,722 --> 01:22:16,357
But they haven't shown up yet.

1329
01:22:16,424 --> 01:22:18,860
Probably 'cause they're busy
jerking it.

1330
01:22:18,928 --> 01:22:21,863
Cody, shut the fuck up!

1331
01:22:21,931 --> 01:22:23,431
Okay, alright, yeah.

1332
01:22:23,498 --> 01:22:26,434
They're not coming
because they're all dead.

1333
01:22:26,501 --> 01:22:29,104
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

1334
01:22:29,171 --> 01:22:30,438
No, just, ugh.

1335
01:22:30,505 --> 01:22:32,107
Everyone needs
to get out of here.

1336
01:22:32,174 --> 01:22:33,943
Where's Kiana?

1337
01:22:34,009 --> 01:22:36,544
[intense music]

1338
01:22:43,351 --> 01:22:46,088
Oh, you idiot.

1339
01:22:47,555 --> 01:22:49,892
- Did you finish?
- Good knocking, asshole.

1340
01:22:49,959 --> 01:22:51,593
- Sara?
- Did you finish?

1341
01:22:51,659 --> 01:22:54,263
- I thought you weren't coming!
- I don't care, Kiana.

1342
01:22:54,330 --> 01:22:57,266
Skyler, did you finish?

1343
01:22:57,333 --> 01:22:59,367
No, Sara, I didn't finish,
alright?

1344
01:22:59,434 --> 01:23:01,904
So can you get out?

1345
01:23:01,971 --> 01:23:05,274
[grunting]
What the hell, Sara?

1346
01:23:05,341 --> 01:23:06,942
Okay, seriously, everyone
needs to get out of here.

1347
01:23:07,009 --> 01:23:09,611
What are you doing?
You're being a crazy person.

1348
01:23:09,677 --> 01:23:11,146
He doesn't like you, Kiana.

1349
01:23:11,213 --> 01:23:13,048
He's just turning into
some kinda sex freak.

1350
01:23:13,115 --> 01:23:14,749
Come on, this energy's so right.

1351
01:23:14,816 --> 01:23:16,318
Let's just do it
in front of everyone!

1352
01:23:16,384 --> 01:23:19,255
You are all junked up
with alien sex gas, you idiot.

1353
01:23:19,321 --> 01:23:21,190
Hi, who the fuck are you again?

1354
01:23:21,257 --> 01:23:23,458
She's with me.

1355
01:23:23,524 --> 01:23:27,662
Forget about them.
Kiana, I love you.

1356
01:23:30,398 --> 01:23:32,067
Well, fine!

1357
01:23:32,134 --> 01:23:34,904
Sara, babe, I'm sorry.

1358
01:23:34,970 --> 01:23:36,205
Let's just do it.

1359
01:23:36,272 --> 01:23:37,239
It'll be like old times

1360
01:23:37,306 --> 01:23:38,773
in front of all of these people.

1361
01:23:40,309 --> 01:23:43,178
[grunting] This is why we
broke up in the first place.

1362
01:23:43,245 --> 01:23:44,712
I'm sick of begging!

1363
01:23:44,779 --> 01:23:47,515
Somebody better fuck me right..

[thudding]

1365
01:23:51,353 --> 01:23:53,956
Skyler!

1366
01:23:54,023 --> 01:23:55,891
Okay, truth bomb.

1367
01:23:55,958 --> 01:23:59,094
I had sex for the first time
the other night.

1368
01:23:59,161 --> 01:24:00,628
Okay, yeah, whatever.

1369
01:24:00,695 --> 01:24:03,933
The point is
I gave birth tonight.

1370
01:24:03,999 --> 01:24:08,569
Yeah, and what I gave birth
to was fucking aliens.

1372
01:24:10,471 --> 01:24:12,740
One hundred percent
not playing, okay.

1373
01:24:12,807 --> 01:24:14,542
So seriously,
everyone needs to clear out

1374
01:24:14,609 --> 01:24:16,544
because they are coming..

1375
01:24:16,611 --> 01:24:18,446

1379
01:24:39,500 --> 01:24:41,769
Ugh, Kiana.

1380
01:24:41,836 --> 01:24:43,939
Now I'm gonna have to
kick your ass.

Just so you know,
I had no idea about Skyler

1400
01:26:34,216 --> 01:26:37,553
and I really
value our friendship.

1401
01:26:37,618 --> 01:26:40,456

So, what's our plan?

1422
01:28:41,476 --> 01:28:44,379
Save my mom, save the world.

1423
01:28:44,446 --> 01:28:47,782
You're not going by yourself,
you could die.

1424
01:28:48,883 --> 01:28:50,319
Maybe.

1425
01:28:52,187 --> 01:28:54,722
But I'm the one
who started all this.

I'm so sorry, mom.

1437
01:30:14,469 --> 01:30:15,803
Oh, Sare Bear.

1438
01:30:15,870 --> 01:30:18,173
You have nothing
to be sorry about.

okay, daddy, take a few days

1470
01:33:04,406 --> 01:33:06,608
take a week even, I'll be fine.

1471
01:33:06,675 --> 01:33:08,376
Take a month.

1472
01:33:08,443 --> 01:33:11,880
No, I know you can't
actually take a month.

1473
01:33:11,948 --> 01:33:14,783
My gymnastics career is ruined.

1474
01:33:14,850 --> 01:33:17,285
My mom is gonna be so angry.

Hey, hey, is it over?

- Oh, hey.
- Hi.

Listen, d-do you wanna
go out with me?

1480
01:33:31,299 --> 01:33:33,335
- Yeah. Uh, yeah.
- Yeah?

1481
01:33:33,401 --> 01:33:35,704
I realize this is probably an
awkward time to be doing this.

1482
01:33:35,770 --> 01:33:37,305
'Also, I crashed my car'

1483
01:33:37,372 --> 01:33:39,875
'it's kinda hard to drive
with one eye.'

1484
01:33:39,942 --> 01:33:44,513
So, this is what
parties are like?

1485
01:33:44,579 --> 01:33:48,350
Yeah, but the monsters
are usually way bigger.
