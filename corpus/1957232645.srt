Morning, ma'am.

17
00:02:25,783 --> 00:02:28,033
I'm with the Fire Department,
he's with Florida Gas.

18
00:02:28,117 --> 00:02:31,283
Yeah, our system alerted us to a gas leak
where our main feeds into your boiler.

19
00:02:31,367 --> 00:02:32,867
Is your husband home?

20
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:34,742
He's in the shower.
Should we get out of the house?

21
00:02:34,825 --> 00:02:38,408
No, this is as likely a computer
error as an actual leak, but...

22
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:40,367
we should check to be safe.

23
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:42,825
- May we come in?
- Please, yes.

24
00:02:42,908 --> 00:02:45,658
- Thank you, ma'am.
- [woman] Yeah, thank you.

25
00:03:03,117 --> 00:03:05,367
Hey, how far away
is Jacksonville?

26
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:08,617
With traffic? Six hours.

27
00:03:09,575 --> 00:03:11,075
Maybe more.

28
00:03:12,992 --> 00:03:15,033
You got blood on your shirt.

29
00:03:16,158 --> 00:03:18,158
You should change
before we continue.

30
00:03:18,242 --> 00:03:20,908
Well I'd hate to take a detour.
This'll be on the news in a half hour.

31
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:23,033
If he has any sense he'll
be on the move already.

32
00:03:23,117 --> 00:03:27,033
Uh, it'll take him a day to get
the courage, another to plan it.

33
00:03:27,117 --> 00:03:30,658
We'll be there, besides.
We don't take unnecessary risks.

34
00:03:32,325 --> 00:03:34,992
- I'm sorry.
- Happens.

35

It could also mean, like,
very slow to understand.

45
00:04:17,742 --> 00:04:19,783
I'm pretty sure I was that.

46
00:04:19,867 --> 00:04:21,325
That makes more sense.

47
00:04:21,408 --> 00:04:24,867

and you'll try harder.

gonna have to send in an air strike.

go different than last year

fucking year that came before that.

pretty good.

Or winning the lottery.

109
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:31,450
Threesome for you
<i>would</i> be winning the lottery.

clowns, for the day...

shit with parachutes, okay?

- Oh, I have no idea.

and...

116
00:07:45,367 --> 00:07:46,867
Well, I'm older.

117
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:48,617
- Just trying to keep you alive.
- Hey, no, no, hey, hey.

118
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,575
Don't you worry about that.
That's our job.

tickets and we'll keep <i>you</i> alive.

- [Ben] Now we're talking.

the team player...

125

- Oh, no, no, no.

I have seen shit in the woods.

who shit in the woods?

129

- [Hannah] Oh, are we being too loud?

130
00:08:15,617 --> 00:08:18,158
Are we too loud, Ethan?
I'm sorry. I'm so...

131
00:08:18,242 --> 00:08:20,867
- How about this? Congratulations!
- Congratulations!

132
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:23,700

133

just get into this?

your head in the game?

dance with the devil?

the devil right now, you fucker.

- Listen, the objective is to put it <i>in</i> the hole.

139
00:08:43,492 --> 00:08:45,700

- I'm gonna show you how to do it, snowflake.

See? That's how it's done.

147
00:09:02,033 --> 00:09:03,492
- Nothing left to prove.
- [man] How can I follow that?

148
00:09:03,575 --> 00:09:06,033
Give me that.
This is how you follow it.

149
00:09:06,117 --> 00:09:09,325
Yeah! Yeah!

150
00:09:09,408 --> 00:09:13,283
I'm not judging.
I'm just trying to understand.

151

- Yes.

00:10:10,825 --> 00:10:13,408
I remember the landing
being softer last time.

169
00:10:13,492 --> 00:10:16,075
Nope. It went
pretty much like that.

170
00:10:16,992 --> 00:10:17,950
[groans]

171
00:10:18,033 --> 00:10:19,200
[siren chirps]

172
00:10:22,492 --> 00:10:23,700
[grunts]

173
00:10:27,783 --> 00:10:29,575
What are you gonna do,
arrest me?

174
00:10:30,158 --> 00:10:31,075
Huh?

175
00:10:31,533 --> 00:10:32,867
Fuck.

176
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:34,700
You wonder why you failed
your psych eval, huh?

177
00:10:34,783 --> 00:10:37,158
Did you tighten these
with a fucking torque wrench?

178
00:10:37,242 --> 00:10:38,867
Oh, does it hurt?

179
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:42,700
- Yeah, it fucking hurts.
- Good. Maybe you'll learn something.

180
00:10:42,783 --> 00:10:44,700
Hey, eyes on me.
Quit your sulking, all right?

181
00:10:44,783 --> 00:10:47,033
You got yourself here.
This shit is on you.

182
00:10:47,117 --> 00:10:48,533
Fucking earned it.

183
00:10:58,075 --> 00:10:59,533
Let's go.

184
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,033
Here's the thing.

185
00:11:04,117 --> 00:11:06,533
We both know that had
nothing to do with fun,

186
00:11:06,617 --> 00:11:09,117
and it sure as shit wasn't
an accident, all right?

187
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,408
Look, H.,
I know what you're trying to do.

188
00:11:13,492 --> 00:11:16,575
Maybe those other assholes,
they don't see it, but I certainly do.

189
00:11:20,533 --> 00:11:24,200
You know, maybe a summer in a fire
tower by yourself do you some good.

190
00:11:24,283 --> 00:11:25,658
- Maybe.
- Mm-hmmm.

191
00:11:25,742 --> 00:11:27,658
Maybe I'll just jump.

192
00:11:34,617 --> 00:11:36,492
Jesus Christ.

193
00:12:16,533 --> 00:12:18,283
It doesn't look like
they took anything.

194
00:12:18,367 --> 00:12:20,408
Toothbrushes still
in the bathroom.

195
00:12:36,783 --> 00:12:38,617
[Jack] They're gone.

196
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,992
We need a destination. I'll take
the computer, you take the house.

197
00:13:05,617 --> 00:13:08,992
He withdrew $10,000 from his account.
He'll go dark now.

198
00:13:09,075 --> 00:13:11,992
We need to know the friend or
family member he's running to.

199
00:13:12,075 --> 00:13:13,200
[Patrick] All right.

200
00:13:15,283 --> 00:13:16,367
Come on.

201
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,450
[Patrick]
Where are you going?

202
00:13:39,408 --> 00:13:43,075
Uh... How about the one
in law enforcement?

203
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,117
[Jack] Survival school.

204
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,575
This keeps getting better.

205
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:53,617
[keyboard clacking]

206
00:14:03,408 --> 00:14:06,325
[Owen] <i>What do you
know about my job, son?</i>

207
00:14:06,408 --> 00:14:08,200
- You're an accountant.
- Yeah.

208
00:14:08,283 --> 00:14:09,575
At least I thought you were.

209
00:14:09,658 --> 00:14:12,575
I'm a forensic accountant,
which means...

210
00:14:12,658 --> 00:14:15,033
I look for things
that don't add up.

211
00:14:15,867 --> 00:14:18,492
And I found some.

212
00:14:18,575 --> 00:14:23,325
The man I work for, he was killed
today because of what I found.

213
00:14:23,408 --> 00:14:25,950
But I still know it,
which means they're gonna...

214
00:14:26,033 --> 00:14:28,117
They're gonna
come after me, too.

215
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,950
- We need to go to the police.
- No.

216
00:14:30,033 --> 00:14:32,867
The DA has police protection
24 hours a day.

217
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:34,908
And where were they
this morning?

218
00:14:34,992 --> 00:14:38,575
The case implicates a lot of people,
son, people with a lot to lose.

219
00:14:38,658 --> 00:14:43,117
Governors, congressmen...
We can only trust people that we know.

220
00:14:44,075 --> 00:14:45,658
You understand me?

221
00:14:47,992 --> 00:14:49,450
Yeah.

222
00:15:08,158 --> 00:15:09,283
[sighs]

223
00:15:11,908 --> 00:15:14,283
- Hey, baby.
- Hey, you.

224
00:15:14,367 --> 00:15:16,992
- How's the bun?
- Cooking.

225
00:15:17,992 --> 00:15:19,242
Just, come here.

226
00:15:21,283 --> 00:15:22,742
Good to see you.

227
00:15:25,033 --> 00:15:27,492
- Mmm. How was your day?
- Oh, same old.

228
00:15:27,575 --> 00:15:29,117
- [Allison] Really?
- Mm-hmm.

229
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:33,033
I heard you had a little
run-in with the hotshot.

230
00:15:33,117 --> 00:15:36,783
Well, she's just letting her demons
run the show, you know what I mean?

231
00:15:36,867 --> 00:15:38,325
[Allison] You weren't too hard
on her, were you?

232
00:15:38,408 --> 00:15:40,117
[Ethan] Maybe I was
a little hard on her.

233
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,325
But you know something,
she's an asshole.

234
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:44,033
She deserves it.

235
00:15:44,117 --> 00:15:45,533
[Allison]
She's plenty hard on herself

236
00:15:45,617 --> 00:15:47,783
and she probably doesn't
need any help from you.

237
00:15:47,867 --> 00:15:51,658
[Ethan] Nothing like arguing with my wife
about how I spoke to my ex-girlfriend.

238
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:53,825
Especially when
my wife takes her side.

239
00:15:53,908 --> 00:15:55,867
I'm not taking her side,
I'm just not taking yours.

240
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:58,200
You are taking her side,
because I don't even have a side.

241
00:15:58,283 --> 00:16:00,242
Then you're on her side.

242
00:16:00,367 --> 00:16:02,658
What is that,
like an accusation?

243
00:16:04,617 --> 00:16:07,033
- Baby, are we fighting?
- [groans]

244
00:16:07,117 --> 00:16:08,492
God, men are simple.

245
00:16:08,575 --> 00:16:11,075
We're not fighting, babe.
Dinner's on the stove.

246
00:16:11,158 --> 00:16:14,617
There's beer in the fridge.
All's right with the world.

247
00:16:18,075 --> 00:16:19,742
Oh, did you feel that one?

248
00:16:19,825 --> 00:16:23,575
- Uh-uh. No.
- Oh, my God, how did you not feel that?

249
00:16:23,658 --> 00:16:25,033
[chuckles]
I just didn't, baby.

250
00:16:25,117 --> 00:16:26,908
- I think I know what it is.
- Hmm? What is it?

251
00:16:26,992 --> 00:16:28,867
I think it's that
concrete skull of yours.

252
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:31,700
I love how somehow it's my fault
that I don't feel the baby kicking.

253
00:16:31,783 --> 00:16:33,408
Oh, babe,
everything's your fault.

254
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:35,408
- Everything is my...
- The baby is your fault.

255
00:16:35,492 --> 00:16:39,533
See, scientifically speaking,
it's 50% my fault, 50% your fault.

256
00:16:39,617 --> 00:16:41,575
- Is that what you think?
- That's what I think.

257
00:16:41,658 --> 00:16:43,408
- You know what I think?
- Oh, no, you're gonna put me in a headlock?

258
00:16:43,492 --> 00:16:45,200
- Uh-huh.
- Oh, no!

259
00:16:45,283 --> 00:16:50,158
I think that everything is your
fault until this kid turns four.

260
00:16:50,242 --> 00:16:53,742
- We clear?
- Ah! We're so clear, baby.

261
00:16:53,825 --> 00:16:56,242
We're so clear. Mmm.

262
00:16:56,325 --> 00:16:58,450
- [phone ringing]
- [Ethan chuckling]

263
00:17:02,242 --> 00:17:03,492
Ah!

264
00:17:03,575 --> 00:17:04,742
Hello?

265
00:17:04,825 --> 00:17:07,200
- Allison. It's Owen.
- [Allison] <i>Owen!</i>

266
00:17:07,283 --> 00:17:11,075
Hey. Could I talk to Ethan?

267
00:17:11,158 --> 00:17:14,408
- Um, I got a real problem.
- <i>Okay.</i>

268
00:17:20,492 --> 00:17:22,158
Owen, how you doing, man?

269
00:17:22,242 --> 00:17:25,950
<i>Hey, Ethan. Um...
I've been better.</i>

270
00:17:26,575 --> 00:17:27,992
What's going on?

271
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:00,867
[sighs heavily]

272
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:04,033
[exhales]

273
00:19:04,742 --> 00:19:06,033
[inhales deeply]

274
00:19:06,783 --> 00:19:08,117
[exhales heavily]

275
00:19:20,408 --> 00:19:23,742
- Hi, buddy.
- [Connor] Hey.

276
00:19:25,283 --> 00:19:26,575
What are you writing?

277
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:28,700
It's for you.

278
00:19:30,158 --> 00:19:31,867
It's all my secrets.

279
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:38,367
But I don't want you to read it...
or even look at it.

280
00:19:40,908 --> 00:19:42,950
Promise?

281
00:19:43,033 --> 00:19:45,200
What am I supposed to
do with it?

282
00:19:56,158 --> 00:19:58,408
Give it to
someone you trust.

283
00:19:59,617 --> 00:20:00,908
When?

284
00:20:02,158 --> 00:20:04,242
With a little luck, never.

285
00:20:08,117 --> 00:20:10,242
I'm really sorry
about this, son.

286
00:20:12,367 --> 00:20:13,992
You did the right thing.

287
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,658
Right?

288
00:20:17,617 --> 00:20:18,992
Yeah.

289
00:20:20,533 --> 00:20:22,158
I'm still sorry.

290
00:20:46,367 --> 00:20:47,992
That's it. Thanks.

291
00:20:48,075 --> 00:20:49,742
- All good?
- Yeah, good.

292
00:20:51,533 --> 00:20:53,450
Wasn't sure what you needed,
so I brought options.

293
00:20:53,533 --> 00:20:55,450
- Yeah, we'll take the truck.
- Roger that.

294
00:21:12,742 --> 00:21:16,575
It's a lot to swallow, Ethan.
How well do you know this guy?

295
00:21:16,658 --> 00:21:20,408
He was married to my sister.
The kid, he's... He's my nephew.

296
00:21:20,492 --> 00:21:22,992
- [waitress] Top you off?
- Yeah.

297
00:21:23,075 --> 00:21:26,325
- Would you like some?
- I'm okay, sweetheart.

298
00:21:26,408 --> 00:21:27,867
Sure you don't want
a piece of this steak?

299
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:29,492
You know I don't
eat that crap.

300
00:21:29,575 --> 00:21:31,283
- Yeah.
- That shit right there is gonna kill you.

301
00:21:31,367 --> 00:21:33,783
I think I rode this
ol' bull back in the '70s.

302
00:21:33,867 --> 00:21:35,908
I don't blame you for
not eating this meat.

303
00:21:37,492 --> 00:21:39,783
I don't know what you want
me to do for you, here.

304
00:21:39,867 --> 00:21:43,533
Well, I'm not sure what
I want you to do, either.

305
00:21:43,617 --> 00:21:44,950
If he's telling the truth,

306
00:21:45,033 --> 00:21:47,575
he needs the Marshal Service,
or the FBI.

307
00:21:47,658 --> 00:21:49,492
I said the same, but...

308
00:21:49,575 --> 00:21:53,908
Like, he wanted me to call a TV
station, get a news crew down here.

309
00:21:53,992 --> 00:21:57,033
Don't be calling
no goddamn TV station.

310
00:21:57,117 --> 00:21:59,533
- We're not trying to invent a story here.
- All right.

311
00:21:59,617 --> 00:22:01,242
You let me know as soon
as he gets to your house.

312
00:22:01,325 --> 00:22:03,533
- I want to see this guy in person.
- You got it.

313
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,158
We're done.

314
00:22:08,242 --> 00:22:12,075
- Go, uh... stop crime.
- I'll do my best.

315
00:22:12,158 --> 00:22:15,575
You know, you should...
maybe consider a salad.

316
00:22:15,658 --> 00:22:17,242
[chuckles]

317
00:22:17,325 --> 00:22:19,575
- Who eats salad for breakfast?
- [Ethan chuckles] Fair enough.

318
00:22:19,658 --> 00:22:21,408
- [cell phone vibrating]
- Sheriff?

319
00:22:21,492 --> 00:22:23,992
Your wife's calling.
Do you want to take the call?

320
00:22:24,825 --> 00:22:26,742
Absolutely not.

321
00:22:38,075 --> 00:22:39,533
[cicada chirping]

322
00:23:28,867 --> 00:23:30,450
Connor!

323
00:23:38,242 --> 00:23:39,533
Hey, Connor!

324
00:23:42,075 --> 00:23:43,450
Back away from it.

325
00:23:44,908 --> 00:23:46,367
[Connor] It's okay, Dad.

326
00:23:48,075 --> 00:23:49,533
He's nice.

327
00:23:54,242 --> 00:23:55,533
We gotta go, come on.

328
00:24:01,242 --> 00:24:02,325
Connor.

329
00:24:09,533 --> 00:24:10,908
[car starting]

330
00:24:20,783 --> 00:24:22,408
[thunder rumbling]

331
00:24:37,783 --> 00:24:40,533
Lynx lookout, copy?

332
00:24:40,617 --> 00:24:43,033
[man over radio] <i>Copy, Lynx.
Do you see smoke?</i>

333
00:24:43,117 --> 00:24:45,325
I see thunderclouds
and 30-mile-an-hour wind.

334
00:24:45,408 --> 00:24:49,033
Is there any precipitation
in that storm?

335
00:24:49,117 --> 00:24:52,158
<i>Lynx, keep this frequency clear
unless you see smoke.</i>

336
00:24:52,242 --> 00:24:54,158

That was our exit route!

I have to get out of here.

- Hey.
- <i>You somewhere better?</i>

371

- <i>Yeah, it should bank north.</i>

392

No, it's not banking north.

393
00:28:26,075 --> 00:28:32,867
Can you imagine what Lewis and Clark
must have thought when they saw that?

394
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:34,950
Do you think
they came this way?

395
00:28:35,033 --> 00:28:39,200
Right this way.
This is the Lewis and Clark trail.

396
00:28:39,283 --> 00:28:41,450
All we did was pave it.

397
00:28:45,575 --> 00:28:47,200
I like it out here.

398
00:28:48,283 --> 00:28:50,325

and "unlikely" is not an absolute.

512
00:40:33,825 --> 00:40:36,117
The man was resourceful enough
to make it all the way here,

513
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:39,950
so assume he was resourceful
enough to have duplicates

514
00:40:40,033 --> 00:40:42,783
of everything we retrieved
from the DA's office.

515
00:40:42,867 --> 00:40:46,825
And assume that those duplicates
are in the possession of that boy.

516
00:40:49,617 --> 00:40:51,950
Assume the worst
case scenario.

517
00:40:53,825 --> 00:40:56,117
Assume catastrophe and...

518
00:40:56,825 --> 00:40:58,367
act accordingly.

519
00:40:58,450 --> 00:40:59,992
It's a lot of risk.

520
00:41:00,075 --> 00:41:02,033
That, I am aware of.

521
00:41:02,117 --> 00:41:05,325
You have, what, maybe six hours
before this thing's untenable?

522
00:41:05,408 --> 00:41:08,033
I can buy us more time.

523
00:41:08,117 --> 00:41:09,950
But they have to
have the stomach for it.

524
00:41:11,825 --> 00:41:14,450
I will make them
have the stomach for it.

525
00:41:15,450 --> 00:41:17,867
Should have been
two teams.

526
00:41:17,950 --> 00:41:19,575
Hit 'em
at the same time.

527
00:41:19,658 --> 00:41:21,700
What got us here doesn't really
matter, now, does it, Jack?

528
00:41:21,783 --> 00:41:24,117
- No, it doesn't.
- No, it doesn't.

529
00:41:25,617 --> 00:41:29,533
It's a zero-sum game.
Treat it that way.

530
00:42:27,533 --> 00:42:30,283
- Are we going to the station?
- Brother-in-law...

531
00:42:31,908 --> 00:42:33,992
I think.

532
00:42:34,075 --> 00:42:35,658
Maybe we get lucky.

533
00:42:35,742 --> 00:42:37,825
This is a lot of risk
for a boy.

534
00:42:37,908 --> 00:42:41,242
Well, they're worried
about what he might know.

535
00:42:41,325 --> 00:42:43,325
And what he saw us do.

536
00:42:46,158 --> 00:42:50,950
From this point forward,
we put down anyone who sees our faces.

537
00:42:51,033 --> 00:42:55,950
That's gonna bring a lot of attention to
this town. There's enough of that already.

538
00:42:56,033 --> 00:42:58,450
Give 'em something else
to worry about.

539
00:43:17,825 --> 00:43:19,408
Let 'em focus on this
for a while.

540
00:44:08,242 --> 00:44:09,325
Yep.

541
00:44:17,783 --> 00:44:19,408
[Ethan] Allie, there's
no sign of Connor.

542
00:44:19,492 --> 00:44:21,200
[Allison]
<i>Well, are they looking?</i>

543
00:44:21,283 --> 00:44:23,450
Yeah, they're gonna set up
a search crew, but...

544
00:44:25,950 --> 00:44:27,325
[brakes screech]

545
00:44:29,117 --> 00:44:32,033
<i>Ethan?
Ethan, are you still there?</i>

546
00:44:51,742 --> 00:44:53,117
[Hannah] Oh, God.

547
00:44:57,492 --> 00:44:58,575
[exhales]

548
00:45:03,908 --> 00:45:05,742
Let's get you warm.

549
00:45:16,575 --> 00:45:18,158
You hungry?

550
00:45:19,533 --> 00:45:20,992
No.

551
00:45:21,075 --> 00:45:23,075
Well, you should eat anyway.

552
00:45:24,992 --> 00:45:26,367
Here. Here's some...

553
00:45:28,033 --> 00:45:30,283
Candy and shit in it. Here.

554
00:45:35,408 --> 00:45:37,742
So, here's the deal, buddy.

555
00:45:37,825 --> 00:45:42,117
The tower was hit by lightning.
Everything is fried.

556
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:43,325
So we can't...

557
00:45:43,408 --> 00:45:44,950
[groans in pain] Fucker.

558
00:45:46,908 --> 00:45:49,825
So we can't
call the sheriff, or...

559
00:45:49,908 --> 00:45:51,783
fuck me... anybody.

560
00:45:52,867 --> 00:45:55,075
We are gonna have to
hike to town.

561
00:45:55,742 --> 00:45:57,575
[exhales heavily]

562
00:46:01,867 --> 00:46:05,408
So I need to know whether
we should do that tonight,

563
00:46:05,492 --> 00:46:07,492
or if we can wait
till morning.

564
00:46:09,742 --> 00:46:10,950
Are you in trouble?

565
00:46:14,075 --> 00:46:17,117
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

566
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:20,408
Anyone else in trouble?
Anyone we need to be looking for?

567
00:46:24,950 --> 00:46:26,533
Not anymore.

568
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:27,867
[sniffling]

569
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:43,867
All right.

570
00:46:46,075 --> 00:46:47,950
Well...

571
00:46:48,033 --> 00:46:50,825
You don't seem
much up for a hike.

572
00:46:55,033 --> 00:46:57,700
My dad said if anything
happened to him,

573
00:46:57,783 --> 00:46:59,908
I should find someone
I can trust.

574
00:47:11,533 --> 00:47:13,617
Something happen
to your dad?

575
00:47:17,033 --> 00:47:19,117
Are you someone
I can trust?

576
00:47:29,575 --> 00:47:32,367
I'm absolutely
someone you can trust.

577
00:47:54,825 --> 00:47:56,367
[exhales, clears throat]

578
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:00,950
[sniffling]

579
00:48:13,783 --> 00:48:15,158
Where'd they find him?

580
00:48:15,825 --> 00:48:17,492
On the road.

581
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:20,283
I hid under a tree.

582
00:48:21,283 --> 00:48:23,200
And ran down to the creek.

583
00:48:23,283 --> 00:48:26,408
'Cause creeks lead to rivers,
and rivers lead to towns.

584
00:48:27,908 --> 00:48:29,658
That they do.

585
00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:32,492
All right. Okay.

586
00:48:36,908 --> 00:48:41,075
- Are we leaving tonight?
- We're leaving right now.

587
00:48:47,075 --> 00:48:49,033
[female newsreader] <i>The fire has
now jumped containment break delta</i>

588
00:48:49,117 --> 00:48:51,242
<i>and is moving
toward Highway 12.</i>

589
00:48:51,325 --> 00:48:54,367
<i>Winds are north-northwest

590
00:48:54,450 --> 00:48:57,075
<i>We are currently at

591
00:48:58,117 --> 00:48:59,700
Babe, I have been calling...

592
00:49:02,075 --> 00:49:04,617
- Can I help you?
- I'm Agent Freers, this is Agent Michaels.

593
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:07,450
Were with the FBI.
Is Deputy Sawyer here?

594
00:49:07,533 --> 00:49:09,617
He's still on duty.
You can try him on your radio.

595
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:12,450
- We run different frequencies.
- Change the channel.

596
00:49:12,533 --> 00:49:14,658
We spoke earlier and he
asked us to meet him here.

597
00:49:14,742 --> 00:49:16,158
Do you mind if we come in?

598
00:49:17,908 --> 00:49:19,200
Yes, I do.

599
00:49:26,783 --> 00:49:28,533
Show me your hands.

600
00:49:48,617 --> 00:49:50,075
House is clear.

601
00:49:53,033 --> 00:49:54,742
I think she's pregnant.

602
00:50:01,408 --> 00:50:02,950
You pregnant?

603
00:50:05,783 --> 00:50:08,867
- How many months?
- Six.

604
00:50:10,325 --> 00:50:11,492
Boy or girl?

605
00:50:13,158 --> 00:50:14,742
Girl.

606
00:50:14,825 --> 00:50:18,742
Well, I want you to think about
her when I ask you these questions.

607
00:50:21,158 --> 00:50:23,367
You run a survival school?

608
00:50:25,658 --> 00:50:29,200
Telling me the truth
is how you survive.

609
00:50:32,783 --> 00:50:34,700
- Is the boy here?
- No.

610
00:50:34,783 --> 00:50:36,575
- Has he been here?
- No.

611
00:50:36,658 --> 00:50:38,867
- Have the police found him?
- Not that I know of and I would know.

612
00:50:38,950 --> 00:50:42,367
- But this is where he'll come?
- I don't know.

613
00:50:46,075 --> 00:50:50,367
Now, that sounds like you're telling
us the truth, Allison, but...

614
00:50:51,867 --> 00:50:53,617
we have to know.

615
00:50:56,242 --> 00:50:58,033
I am telling the truth.

616
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:02,908
I have to know.

617
00:51:06,950 --> 00:51:08,742
I am telling the truth!

618
00:51:11,033 --> 00:51:12,450
I have to know.

619
00:51:12,533 --> 00:51:14,450
[sobbing]
I'm telling the truth.

620
00:51:14,533 --> 00:51:17,117
Okay, my husband found him!
My husband found him!

621
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:18,950
- He's with my husband!
- Where'd he take him?

622
00:51:19,033 --> 00:51:21,200
I don't know, he didn't tell me!
But I can call him!

623
00:51:21,283 --> 00:51:24,117
- I can call him!
- [Jack] Okay.

624
00:51:25,117 --> 00:51:26,783
Call him.

625
00:51:35,575 --> 00:51:36,742
Where's the phone?

626
00:51:43,033 --> 00:51:45,075
You keep this
conversation casual.

627
00:51:45,992 --> 00:51:47,575
You hear me?

628
00:51:53,242 --> 00:51:54,783
Okay.

629
00:51:58,283 --> 00:52:01,158
[Ethan] <i>Hey, baby, I'm dealing
with this fire. What's going on?</i>

630
00:52:01,242 --> 00:52:04,408
Hey, babe, how's the...
how's the boy?

631
00:52:04,492 --> 00:52:06,325
- <i>What?</i>
- Is he hungry?

632
00:52:06,408 --> 00:52:08,450
I bet he's hungry. I'll make him
something to eat if he's hungry.

633
00:52:08,533 --> 00:52:11,825
That's a distress word.
You gave him a fucking distress word!

634
00:52:12,825 --> 00:52:13,742
[Allison screams]

635
00:52:13,825 --> 00:52:15,575
You fucking survivalists!

636
00:52:15,658 --> 00:52:18,158
You wanna survive? I'll give you
something to fucking survive.

637
00:52:21,283 --> 00:52:25,033
- You're pointing that the wrong way.
- No, I'm not.

638
00:52:25,117 --> 00:52:26,492
[Jack screaming]

639
00:52:35,283 --> 00:52:36,658
[screaming]

640
00:52:53,617 --> 00:52:56,367
- You good?
- No, I'm fucking not.

641
00:52:56,450 --> 00:52:58,075
Fuck!

642
00:52:58,158 --> 00:53:00,367
[Hannah] I'm a mother pheasant
plucker, I pluck mother pheasants.

643
00:53:00,450 --> 00:53:02,742
I'm the most pleasant mother pheasant
plucker to ever pluck a mother pheasant.

644
00:53:02,825 --> 00:53:06,408
I'm a pheasant mother plucker,
I pluck mother pheasants.

645
00:53:06,492 --> 00:53:09,283
- I'm the most pleasant mother pheasant...
- Pleasant mother fucker...

646
00:53:09,367 --> 00:53:11,867
- [Hannah] Ooh!
- [chuckles] The most pleasant mother...

647
00:53:13,867 --> 00:53:15,575
All right, break's over.

648
00:53:15,658 --> 00:53:17,242
Okay, we gotta get downhill.

649
00:53:17,325 --> 00:53:19,325
We're gonna take turns running.
When I say "stop," you stop.

650
00:53:19,408 --> 00:53:21,242
You get down like this,
and I'm gonna run past you.

651
00:53:21,325 --> 00:53:23,700
We're gonna keep switching.
Okay, ready? Go, run!

652
00:53:26,450 --> 00:53:27,908
Down!

653
00:53:32,742 --> 00:53:33,658
Run!

654
00:53:36,283 --> 00:53:37,575
Down!

655
00:53:39,825 --> 00:53:41,075
Run!

656
00:53:57,117 --> 00:53:58,950
[Connor] No, no.

657
00:53:59,033 --> 00:54:00,867
Please, please.

658
00:54:02,075 --> 00:54:03,450
[Hannah groaning]

659
00:54:05,117 --> 00:54:06,658
You got hit.

660
00:54:07,242 --> 00:54:08,533
Missed me.

661
00:54:11,242 --> 00:54:12,783
You got hit.

662
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:16,033
No, buddy, it missed me.

663
00:54:19,575 --> 00:54:21,908
We gotta go.

664
00:54:21,992 --> 00:54:23,825
He died right in front of me.

665
00:54:25,367 --> 00:54:26,783
[sobbing]

666
00:54:40,992 --> 00:54:43,533
Let it out, buddy.
Let it out.

667
00:54:52,450 --> 00:54:54,325
There's no blood trail.

668
00:54:54,408 --> 00:54:58,617
- You think we got her?
- It's 50-50, I couldn't see shit.

669
00:54:58,700 --> 00:55:00,533
Ah, fuck.

670
00:55:00,617 --> 00:55:04,908
- You okay? Don't look good.
- Well, there's nothing I can do about that now.

671
00:55:08,408 --> 00:55:09,450
Go deep.

672
00:55:16,950 --> 00:55:18,075
Allie?

673
00:55:19,950 --> 00:55:23,658
Dispatch, this is Alpha One.
We need two more guys.

674
00:55:23,742 --> 00:55:25,367
- [gunshot whizzes]
- [exclaims]

675
00:55:28,992 --> 00:55:30,700
Drop your weapon!
Drop it! Drop it now!

676
00:55:30,783 --> 00:55:33,158
Drop it right fucking now!

677
00:55:33,242 --> 00:55:37,200
Drop your fucking weapon!
Step in the road. Step in the road.

678
00:55:38,325 --> 00:55:41,575
Stop. Face away from me.

679
00:55:41,658 --> 00:55:44,908
You're about to be a father. That's
the only thought I want in your mind.

680
00:55:44,992 --> 00:55:47,617
Now, very slowly,
unbuckle your service belt,

681
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:49,950
drop it to the ground,
toss it to the left.

682
00:55:55,742 --> 00:55:56,950
Drop to your knees.

683
00:56:00,075 --> 00:56:02,283
Allow yourself
to fall forward.

684
00:56:03,033 --> 00:56:04,283
Fall forward.

685
00:56:06,783 --> 00:56:08,533
Hands behind your back.

686
00:56:09,825 --> 00:56:12,242
- Backup weapon?
- Right ankle.

687
00:56:14,492 --> 00:56:16,075
We have another man
with your wife.

688
00:56:16,158 --> 00:56:17,742
On my word,
she will be executed.

689
00:56:17,825 --> 00:56:19,075
You will not be
a father anymore.

690
00:56:19,158 --> 00:56:20,783
- Do you understand?
- I understand.

691
00:56:20,867 --> 00:56:24,075
According to your wife,
the boy's with you.

692
00:56:24,158 --> 00:56:25,575
Now, if that were true,
there'd be a much bigger

693
00:56:25,658 --> 00:56:27,200
police presence
in your yard right now.

694
00:56:27,283 --> 00:56:28,867
The boy hasn't been found.

695
00:56:28,950 --> 00:56:32,867
We think he was tossed
from the vehicle in the crash.

696
00:56:32,950 --> 00:56:34,825
There's a search crew who was
gonna go out in the morning,

697
00:56:34,908 --> 00:56:37,450
but that got called off
because of the fire.

698
00:56:37,533 --> 00:56:40,533
Search is exactly what
you and I are going to do.

699
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:43,783
Jack...

700
00:56:43,867 --> 00:56:45,950
You really think we should
leave that loose end?

701
00:56:46,033 --> 00:56:49,242
Clock is ticking.
We don't have time to search for both.

702
00:56:49,325 --> 00:56:50,575
Okay, let's go.

703
00:56:51,158 --> 00:56:52,283
Up.

704
00:56:57,367 --> 00:57:00,575
[Hannah] A few years from now,
you are gonna find yourself near a lake,

705
00:57:00,658 --> 00:57:03,992
or a forest behind your house,
with some saucy blonde,

706
00:57:04,075 --> 00:57:08,658
and you are gonna want to take
full advantage of that situation.

707
00:57:08,742 --> 00:57:13,492
Campfires are like catnip
for teenage girls.

708
00:57:13,575 --> 00:57:17,950
And all you need is some
fuel, some heat...

709
00:57:19,825 --> 00:57:21,658
and <i>voila!</i>

710
00:57:21,742 --> 00:57:24,783
You're swapping spit
with a cheerleader.

711
00:57:24,867 --> 00:57:29,450
- Getting struck by lightning made you weird.
- I was already weird.

712
00:57:31,408 --> 00:57:32,950
You just look sad to me.

713
00:57:37,158 --> 00:57:38,575
I look sad?

714
00:57:47,742 --> 00:57:49,367
[sighs]

715
00:57:49,450 --> 00:57:52,992
There was a fire last year that
I was in charge of fighting.

716
00:57:53,783 --> 00:57:55,367
And...

717
00:57:55,450 --> 00:57:58,492
I thought the wind was doing one
thing, and it was doing another.

718
00:57:58,575 --> 00:58:04,283
So instead of fighting it,
we found ourselves running from it.

719
00:58:04,367 --> 00:58:07,575
Which is not where
you want to be.

720
00:58:11,575 --> 00:58:15,200
And there were three boys...

721
00:58:15,283 --> 00:58:17,033
around your age...

722
00:58:19,617 --> 00:58:23,283
They got caught in the fire,
and all I could do was watch.

723
00:58:29,325 --> 00:58:31,533
I watched my mother
die of cancer.

724
00:58:35,158 --> 00:58:38,617
It is impossible to feel sorry
for myself around you.

725
00:58:43,367 --> 00:58:44,575
I'm sorry.

726
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:47,033
Me, too.

727
00:58:48,325 --> 00:58:50,325
All right. Let's just...

728
00:58:51,742 --> 00:58:53,242
Let's get you warm, buddy.

729
00:58:57,117 --> 00:58:59,992
- My dad called me buddy.
- Aw, fuck.

730
00:59:00,075 --> 00:59:02,658
I'm sorry,
I won't call you buddy.

731
00:59:02,742 --> 00:59:04,492
No, it's fine.

732
00:59:06,867 --> 00:59:08,450
You can call me buddy.

733
00:59:13,575 --> 00:59:15,742
I'm warm. Let's go.

734
00:59:21,408 --> 00:59:23,450
No fucking way
the kid survived that.

735
00:59:23,533 --> 00:59:25,450
Well, he ain't here.

736
00:59:25,533 --> 00:59:27,283
You want to
search up the hill?

737
00:59:28,575 --> 00:59:30,617
Like I said,
they'll send a team.

738
00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:32,075
I'll check it out.

739
00:59:32,158 --> 00:59:34,200
I'll tell you this much,
I've seen a thousand wrecks.

740
00:59:34,283 --> 00:59:37,283
There's no way somebody survives
that, let alone a kid.

741
00:59:37,367 --> 00:59:41,075
Well, good. Should be easy to find then.
So let's start fucking looking.

742
01:00:05,242 --> 01:00:06,325
[exhales]

743
01:00:22,575 --> 01:00:25,325
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What was that?

744
01:00:27,158 --> 01:00:28,242
Move.

745
01:00:37,908 --> 01:00:40,325
Yeah, the kid made it.

746
01:00:40,408 --> 01:00:43,367
Guess we're about to judge
your tracking skills, deputy.

747
01:00:45,950 --> 01:00:48,450
No, I don't think
you're gonna judge shit.

748
01:00:52,242 --> 01:00:53,950
Yeah, I think I'm done.

749
01:00:55,450 --> 01:00:58,575
I think I'm gonna
go ahead, I'm...

750
01:00:58,658 --> 01:01:00,658
I'm just gonna
keep my dignity.

751
01:01:02,325 --> 01:01:04,908
Look, we know how this thing's
gonna end, right?

752
01:01:06,283 --> 01:01:07,492
Fuck it, I know.

753
01:01:09,783 --> 01:01:11,492
So let's just fucking
do it now, huh?

754
01:01:11,575 --> 01:01:15,075
Play your cards right, Deputy,
you could live through this.

755
01:01:15,158 --> 01:01:16,658
[laughs sarcastically]

756
01:01:17,950 --> 01:01:19,867
What the fuck do I look like?
Do I...

757
01:01:19,950 --> 01:01:22,367
I look like the stupidest
motherfucker on this planet?

758
01:01:22,450 --> 01:01:24,908
- Take a couple of steps back, Jack.
- Fuck you!

759
01:01:24,992 --> 01:01:26,283
You gonna
let me live, huh?

760
01:01:26,367 --> 01:01:28,867
- Yeah.
- Oh, fuck that'd be mistake.

761
01:01:28,950 --> 01:01:30,908
You let me live and
I will shout your description

762
01:01:30,992 --> 01:01:32,367
to anybody
who will fucking listen.

763
01:01:32,450 --> 01:01:34,117
- No, you won't.
- I'll fucking hunt you down!

764
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:36,533
You hear this fucking guy?
If I play my cards right, huh?

765
01:01:36,617 --> 01:01:38,783
- I will fucking kill you.
- Fucking kill me. Shoot me.

766
01:01:38,867 --> 01:01:40,700
- What are you waiting for?
- Give me the word, Jack.

767
01:01:40,783 --> 01:01:43,242
Come on, give him the word.
I'm gonna fucking die right here!

768
01:01:43,325 --> 01:01:44,742
- Right here!
- Jack, give me the word.

769
01:01:44,825 --> 01:01:46,408
Fuck you. And fuck you.

770
01:01:48,325 --> 01:01:49,783
Jack, move left!

771
01:01:57,450 --> 01:01:58,992
[panting]

772
01:02:00,367 --> 01:02:02,992
You will not talk. Ever.

773
01:02:03,658 --> 01:02:05,783
You know why?

774
01:02:05,867 --> 01:02:07,908
Because when
we find this boy,

775
01:02:09,117 --> 01:02:11,575
I'm not killing him.
You are.

776
01:02:13,533 --> 01:02:15,742
That's how bad I don't want
to shoot a pregnant woman.

777
01:02:18,825 --> 01:02:21,617
But you try this shit again,

778
01:02:21,700 --> 01:02:23,825
I will fucking
burn her alive.

779
01:02:23,908 --> 01:02:25,867
- Have I made myself clear?
- Yeah.

780
01:02:27,075 --> 01:02:28,200
[Jack] Yeah?

781
01:02:29,117 --> 01:02:30,408
Now, track.

782
01:02:42,908 --> 01:02:44,325
Move.

783
01:02:50,367 --> 01:02:52,158
You okay, brother?

784
01:02:52,242 --> 01:02:55,158
You're not making much sense
when you talk.

785
01:02:55,242 --> 01:02:58,075
I am so fucking
sick of this place.

786
01:03:16,908 --> 01:03:19,242
- Is that a fire?
- Yeah.

787
01:03:20,658 --> 01:03:22,450
And it's a big one.

788
01:03:28,658 --> 01:03:30,617
We gotta go back.

789
01:03:36,117 --> 01:03:37,325
I'm not going
through that again.

790
01:03:37,408 --> 01:03:39,200
We can't go through <i>that.</i>

791
01:03:39,283 --> 01:03:41,242
That eats everything
in its path.

792
01:03:41,325 --> 01:03:43,950
I would have seen this from the tower.
I didn't call it in.

793
01:03:44,033 --> 01:03:46,742
They're gonna send a chopper
to figure out why.

794
01:03:46,825 --> 01:03:49,325
Chopper is that way,
back there.

795
01:03:49,408 --> 01:03:51,867
You don't get through that.
We're going that way.

796
01:03:51,950 --> 01:03:53,158
All right?

797
01:03:56,950 --> 01:03:58,033
Now.

798
01:04:44,742 --> 01:04:45,992
[sighs in exasperation]

799
01:04:48,033 --> 01:04:49,242
[sighs] Oh!

800
01:04:49,325 --> 01:04:50,617
You.

801
01:05:05,283 --> 01:05:06,658
[exhales]

802
01:05:14,408 --> 01:05:15,908
[groans in pain]

803
01:05:15,992 --> 01:05:17,950
[breathes heavily]

804
01:05:21,908 --> 01:05:26,075
- You okay?
- Oh, yeah. I'm peachy.

805
01:05:27,742 --> 01:05:29,158
[Hannah groans]

806
01:06:03,617 --> 01:06:06,450
- Turn around.
- Why? I don't care.

807
01:06:06,533 --> 01:06:08,075
We've shared enough today.

808
01:06:09,325 --> 01:06:10,783
Come on.

809
01:06:53,075 --> 01:06:56,117
Connor. Get down off the bed.

810
01:06:57,408 --> 01:06:59,200
Get down off the bed.

811
01:07:01,367 --> 01:07:02,617
[mouthing] Quiet.

812
01:07:15,325 --> 01:07:16,992
Listen...

813
01:07:17,075 --> 01:07:20,575
Those men that came for your
father, did you see their faces?

814
01:07:21,908 --> 01:07:24,242
- Yeah.
- Come here.

815
01:07:29,950 --> 01:07:31,325
What?

816
01:07:31,408 --> 01:07:32,783
Is that them?

817
01:07:42,492 --> 01:07:44,200
That's them.

818
01:07:44,283 --> 01:07:46,617
- Get under the bed.
- No. We can't stay here.

819
01:07:46,700 --> 01:07:48,450
I know. Get under the bed.

820
01:07:49,700 --> 01:07:51,075
Go.

821
01:07:51,158 --> 01:07:52,950
Hey, how many people
stay in those?

822
01:07:53,033 --> 01:07:55,492
[Ethan]
Usually one, but...

823
01:07:55,575 --> 01:07:58,325
from the looks of it,
there's nobody home.

824
01:07:58,408 --> 01:08:00,617
[Jack] Somebody's home.

825
01:08:00,700 --> 01:08:04,283
What kind of fire watcher leaves
his cabin with a fire burning?

826
01:08:04,367 --> 01:08:08,533
What are the chances that
fire watcher has a weapon?

827
01:08:08,617 --> 01:08:11,825
You're in the forest of Montana,
so the chances are pretty good.

828
01:08:17,242 --> 01:08:20,033
There's no tactical approach
to the top of that tower.

829
01:08:20,117 --> 01:08:22,367
He'll know whoever's up there.
They'll show themselves to him.

830
01:08:22,450 --> 01:08:25,825
We put them all down from here.
It's the safest play.

831
01:08:25,908 --> 01:08:28,617
[Patrick] Yeah, I don't have
a better idea.

832
01:08:28,700 --> 01:08:30,158
Hey, you're going
up that tower.

833
01:08:31,617 --> 01:08:35,158
Boy's in there,
you're gonna bring him down to me.

834
01:08:35,242 --> 01:08:36,992
If he isn't,

835
01:08:37,075 --> 01:08:40,075
start a fire in the middle of that
cabin and burn it to the ground.

836
01:08:40,158 --> 01:08:43,408
- Why burn it?
- So I know you ain't lying.

837
01:08:44,575 --> 01:08:45,825
Go on, go.

838
01:08:46,742 --> 01:08:48,158
Move.

839
01:08:51,992 --> 01:08:53,533
[Ethan sighs]

840
01:08:55,992 --> 01:08:57,533
[horse snorts]

841
01:09:08,867 --> 01:09:11,742
Nobody's here!
The door's locked!

842
01:09:11,825 --> 01:09:14,325
It won't be the first door
you've kicked in.

843
01:09:17,450 --> 01:09:19,742
Come on, we need
some higher ground.

844
01:09:25,575 --> 01:09:28,575
If you're hidden,
you stay hid.

845
01:09:28,658 --> 01:09:33,408
There's a rifle trained on me.
There's two of them and they're both armed.

846
01:09:46,992 --> 01:09:49,158
Connor, you're doing great.

847
01:09:49,242 --> 01:09:51,367
You just stay there,
okay?

848
01:09:52,367 --> 01:09:54,908
Don't move. Don't talk.

849
01:09:56,992 --> 01:09:58,742
You got a weapon in here, H.?

850
01:10:00,658 --> 01:10:02,908
I have a pretty sharp axe.

851
01:10:02,992 --> 01:10:05,075
Afraid that's not gonna do it.

852
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:08,908
I, uh...

853
01:10:08,992 --> 01:10:10,950
I don't know how to
get us out of this.

854
01:10:14,283 --> 01:10:17,575
The fire's gonna be here in about an hour.
That should get us out of this.

855
01:10:18,450 --> 01:10:19,950
We don't have an hour.

856
01:10:23,992 --> 01:10:25,617
[sighs] Fuck.

857
01:10:25,700 --> 01:10:28,325
[Patrick] I see nothing.
No movement.

858
01:10:29,367 --> 01:10:30,867
He's just standing there.

859
01:10:33,450 --> 01:10:35,117
I'm fading here, partner.

860
01:10:38,867 --> 01:10:40,450
I know.

861
01:10:44,533 --> 01:10:46,200
Wait, he's talking.

862
01:10:48,950 --> 01:10:50,908
Yeah, he's talking, Jack.

863
01:10:53,200 --> 01:10:54,908
[Ethan]
Get him out of here, H!

864
01:10:54,992 --> 01:10:56,158
[Hannah] Run!

865
01:10:56,242 --> 01:10:57,533
[gunfire continues]

866
01:11:00,158 --> 01:11:01,700
- [Connor screams]
- [Ethan] Come on, Connor!

867
01:11:04,117 --> 01:11:05,783
All right! Okay!

868
01:11:10,075 --> 01:11:11,450
[gunfire continues]

869
01:11:12,242 --> 01:11:13,992
Go, H!

870
01:11:14,075 --> 01:11:16,658
- Come on!
- Go, Connor! Go!

871
01:11:18,908 --> 01:11:20,492
I got you.

872
01:11:24,408 --> 01:11:26,867
- [Jack] Movement! Running west!
- Fuck.

873
01:11:26,950 --> 01:11:30,450
- [Jack] Take the shot! Take the fucking shot!
- [bullets ricocheting]

874
01:11:30,533 --> 01:11:32,200
I got not shot! Fuck!

875
01:11:34,742 --> 01:11:36,700
Okay. We move.

876
01:11:38,575 --> 01:11:40,742
- [gunshots]
- Contact, right!

877
01:11:48,367 --> 01:11:50,283
That was a deer rifle.

878
01:11:50,367 --> 01:11:53,242
All right, I'll take the
shooter, you take the boy.

879
01:11:53,325 --> 01:11:57,992
If there's even a chance that it's her...
I take the shooter.

880
01:11:59,408 --> 01:12:01,533
All right.

881
01:12:01,617 --> 01:12:03,575
Rendezvous back here.

882
01:12:04,825 --> 01:12:06,742
Can you cover me?

883
01:12:06,825 --> 01:12:08,867
- Moving.
- Move.

884
01:12:08,950 --> 01:12:10,742
[gun firing]

885
01:12:20,658 --> 01:12:21,992
[exhales heavily]

886
01:12:25,825 --> 01:12:27,200
[Hannah] Keep going.

887
01:12:28,325 --> 01:12:29,492
Toward the fire?

888
01:12:30,700 --> 01:12:32,117
Yeah, buddy.

889
01:12:46,617 --> 01:12:48,325
[rapid gunfire]

890
01:13:03,658 --> 01:13:05,533
- [gunshot]
- [Jack grunts]

891
01:13:05,617 --> 01:13:07,658
- [shell casings clatter]
- [Jack groans]

892
01:13:12,492 --> 01:13:13,783
[Jack] Just...

893
01:13:15,033 --> 01:13:17,325
stop for
a fucking minute!

894
01:13:25,617 --> 01:13:27,242
Where's my husband?

895
01:13:30,200 --> 01:13:31,575
Tower.

896
01:13:32,742 --> 01:13:35,825
- Is he alive?
- I don't know.

897
01:13:37,950 --> 01:13:39,367
[gun clicks]

898
01:13:40,075 --> 01:13:41,283
You're out.

899
01:13:42,158 --> 01:13:43,367
Fuck.

900
01:13:54,075 --> 01:13:55,242
[Jack groans]

901
01:14:11,492 --> 01:14:13,408
I hate this fucking place.

902
01:14:16,450 --> 01:14:18,242
It hates you back.

903
01:14:22,242 --> 01:14:24,283
[Allison breathes heavily]

904
01:14:36,908 --> 01:14:38,158
[Hannah] Go.

905
01:14:48,867 --> 01:14:50,033
Come on.

906
01:14:53,367 --> 01:14:54,617
Come on.

907
01:14:56,033 --> 01:14:57,242
Come here.

908
01:15:00,992 --> 01:15:02,450
Come here.

909
01:15:02,533 --> 01:15:03,908
Come here.

910
01:15:04,992 --> 01:15:06,783
Listen to me.

911
01:15:06,867 --> 01:15:09,825
You're gonna run a hundred
yards towards the fire.

912
01:15:09,908 --> 01:15:14,075
You're gonna turn left and you're gonna
keep running until you get to a creek.

913
01:15:14,158 --> 01:15:17,575
When you get to a creek,
you find the deepest, widest part,

914
01:15:17,658 --> 01:15:20,617
- and you get in and you lay down.
- No.

915
01:15:20,700 --> 01:15:22,450
- You understand?
- No.

916
01:15:22,533 --> 01:15:24,075
- I'm not...
- No, I'm not leaving you!

917
01:15:24,158 --> 01:15:26,867
Hundred yards, left. Creek.

918
01:15:26,950 --> 01:15:30,200
Hundred yards, left.
Say it.

919
01:15:31,658 --> 01:15:33,950
- Say it! Hundred yards...
- Hundred yards, left.

920
01:15:34,033 --> 01:15:36,992
- Hundred yards, left. Creek.
- Hundred yards, left. Creek.

921
01:15:37,075 --> 01:15:39,325
When you get there,
what are you gonna do?

922
01:15:39,408 --> 01:15:41,158
- Lay down.
- What are you gonna do?

923
01:15:41,242 --> 01:15:42,742
Lay down.

924
01:15:43,825 --> 01:15:44,950
Go.

925
01:15:46,617 --> 01:15:48,033
Go.

926
01:16:01,950 --> 01:16:03,117
[grunting]

927
01:16:06,742 --> 01:16:09,617
Oh, shit. God damn it.

928
01:16:10,700 --> 01:16:12,117
Ethan?

929
01:16:15,992 --> 01:16:17,200
Hey, sweet girl.

930
01:16:19,950 --> 01:16:22,283
How did you...

931
01:16:22,367 --> 01:16:24,617
- Where you hit, babe?
- Yeah, I can't...

932
01:16:24,700 --> 01:16:26,617
I can't tell how bad it is.

933
01:16:26,700 --> 01:16:27,992
Will you check for an exit?

934
01:16:28,075 --> 01:16:30,950
- Oh, God.
- Okay.

935
01:16:31,033 --> 01:16:33,242
- Okay.
- Oh, shit.

936
01:16:35,575 --> 01:16:37,742
How bad is it? Yeah.

937
01:16:39,158 --> 01:16:41,825
- It ain't good, babe.
- It's okay. [shushing]

938
01:16:41,908 --> 01:16:43,533
- Okay.
- It's okay.

939
01:16:43,617 --> 01:16:45,283
- Okay?
- Yeah.

940
01:16:45,367 --> 01:16:46,825
- Okay.
- Did you get 'em?

941
01:16:46,908 --> 01:16:49,367
I got one.
I don't know where the other one is.

942
01:16:51,408 --> 01:16:54,325
You did good. All right.

943
01:16:55,658 --> 01:16:57,742
You gotta
get out of here now.

944
01:16:57,825 --> 01:16:59,450
- Hey.
- No, I'm not leaving you.

945
01:16:59,533 --> 01:17:01,867
It's about our baby girl.

946
01:17:01,950 --> 01:17:05,158
Nothing matters if she don't make
it, you understand me?

947
01:17:06,658 --> 01:17:08,908
No one makes it
through that, baby.

948
01:17:25,617 --> 01:17:27,158
[breathing heavily]

949
01:18:48,450 --> 01:18:49,950
[both grunting]

950
01:18:58,450 --> 01:18:59,950
- [Hanna yells]
- [Patrick grunts]

951
01:19:09,992 --> 01:19:11,700
Come on.

952
01:19:11,783 --> 01:19:14,075
You really want
to die for this kid?

953
01:19:15,908 --> 01:19:17,658
You don't even know him.

954
01:19:19,242 --> 01:19:23,825
You know, if you walk away...
right now, I won't fire.

955
01:19:28,325 --> 01:19:29,992
You got my word, okay?

956
01:19:31,867 --> 01:19:33,450
Just walk away.

957
01:19:37,450 --> 01:19:40,408
Hey! You looking for me?

958
01:19:52,075 --> 01:19:53,742
Fuck you!

959
01:19:53,825 --> 01:19:55,033
[Patrick cries out]

960
01:19:58,450 --> 01:19:59,950
Connor, run!

961
01:20:07,617 --> 01:20:08,825
[Patrick] Connor!

962
01:20:10,283 --> 01:20:11,950
You're gonna hide, huh?

963
01:20:14,200 --> 01:20:17,658
I'll show you what happens
when you run and hide.

964
01:20:24,367 --> 01:20:26,658
When you come out,
I'll stop.

965
01:20:28,617 --> 01:20:31,367
Keep hiding,
I'll keep hurting her.

966
01:20:33,242 --> 01:20:35,200
You watching this? Huh?

967
01:20:35,283 --> 01:20:37,575
- Don't come out!
- Shut the fuck up!

968
01:20:37,658 --> 01:20:40,700
[Connor] If I come out,
will you let her go?

969
01:20:42,533 --> 01:20:45,075
No, I won't.

970
01:20:45,158 --> 01:20:48,700
You know, it won't be this.
She won't suffer.

971
01:20:54,242 --> 01:20:55,700
Okay.

972
01:20:55,783 --> 01:20:57,033
Stop!

973
01:21:04,533 --> 01:21:06,033
[Patrick] That's good.

974
01:21:07,908 --> 01:21:09,283
Now, don't run.

975
01:21:10,492 --> 01:21:12,325
Okay? No more running.

976
01:21:16,825 --> 01:21:18,575
Can you turn around for me?

977
01:21:21,700 --> 01:21:23,617
That's it, just turn around.

978
01:21:49,325 --> 01:21:50,908
[Patrick screams]

979
01:21:50,992 --> 01:21:52,325
[groans]

980
01:21:57,075 --> 01:21:58,492
[grunts in pain]

981
01:22:04,617 --> 01:22:05,992
[cries out in pain]

982
01:22:14,575 --> 01:22:15,742
You okay?

983
01:22:16,783 --> 01:22:18,158
[Patrick] Do it.

984
01:22:19,158 --> 01:22:20,867
- Do it.
- Look.

985
01:22:26,408 --> 01:22:28,158
The fire will do it for me.

986
01:22:28,242 --> 01:22:30,783
- You can fucking suffer.
- Fuck you.

987
01:22:30,867 --> 01:22:33,117
Run. Run.

988
01:22:39,408 --> 01:22:41,033
Fuck! [grunts]

989
01:22:41,700 --> 01:22:43,408
[screaming]

990
01:22:57,450 --> 01:23:00,158
They'll have planes
in the air soon.

991
01:23:00,242 --> 01:23:02,450
Wonder whether
we'll still be here.

992
01:23:06,867 --> 01:23:08,950
I don't know.

993
01:23:14,117 --> 01:23:15,867
I love you.

994
01:23:15,950 --> 01:23:17,742
I love you.

995
01:23:17,825 --> 01:23:19,033
[fire roaring]

996
01:23:25,450 --> 01:23:26,617
Bye, babe.

997
01:23:57,117 --> 01:23:58,242
[Hannah] Run!

998
01:23:59,492 --> 01:24:00,658
Come on!

999
01:24:06,325 --> 01:24:07,908
Can you swim?

1000
01:24:07,992 --> 01:24:10,575
- [Connor] What?
- Can you swim?

1001
01:24:32,033 --> 01:24:33,867
Okay, listen to me.

1002
01:24:33,950 --> 01:24:37,325
Take a deep breath,
hold it and lay back.

1003
01:24:37,408 --> 01:24:38,742
Watch what I do.

1004
01:24:38,825 --> 01:24:40,033
[inhales deeply]

1005
01:24:55,658 --> 01:24:56,783
[inhales]

1006
01:25:01,783 --> 01:25:02,950
[inhales]

1007
01:25:33,825 --> 01:25:35,117
[fire roaring]

1008
01:26:19,033 --> 01:26:20,408
Hey.

1009
01:26:25,325 --> 01:26:28,242
- I fell asleep.
- I noticed.

1010
01:26:33,408 --> 01:26:34,908
What's wrong?

1011
01:26:36,200 --> 01:26:37,742
Nothing.

1012
01:26:38,408 --> 01:26:40,533
Come on. Let's go.

1013
01:26:42,575 --> 01:26:46,367
- Where are we going?
- Anywhere but here, buddy.

1014
01:27:08,950 --> 01:27:11,325
[plane whirring]

1015
01:27:32,367 --> 01:27:35,200
- Tower's still standing!
- It went right over!

1016
01:27:40,158 --> 01:27:42,033
I got a live body!
I got a live body!

1017
01:27:42,117 --> 01:27:45,158
- We jump here! Vic!
- You're green!

1018
01:27:45,242 --> 01:27:46,408
Go! Go!

1019
01:28:34,200 --> 01:28:35,533
Let's move!

1020
01:28:45,783 --> 01:28:47,950
I got two people!

1021
01:28:48,033 --> 01:28:49,575
My three o'clock, see 'em?

1022
01:28:49,658 --> 01:28:51,283
- It's Hannah.
- Do you see 'em?

1023
01:28:51,367 --> 01:28:52,867
Keep going, I got it!

1024
01:28:52,950 --> 01:28:54,658
Go. Go.

1025
01:29:08,533 --> 01:29:10,242
God damn, Hannah.

1026
01:29:10,325 --> 01:29:12,492
We looked it
right in the eye.

1027
01:29:13,950 --> 01:29:15,158
What was it like?

1028
01:29:17,575 --> 01:29:19,658
It was beautiful.

1029
01:29:21,617 --> 01:29:25,033
I didn't think it was beautiful.
It scared the shit out of me.

1030
01:29:26,283 --> 01:29:28,617
Well, it scared the shit
out of me too, sport.

1031
01:29:29,700 --> 01:29:31,533
Take a look at that cut.

1032
01:29:39,033 --> 01:29:40,700
Got to win one, I see.

1033
01:29:46,617 --> 01:29:47,742
Thanks.

1034
01:29:53,992 --> 01:29:57,783
Jesus Christ.
The fuck happen here?

1035
01:30:03,367 --> 01:30:05,367
- I got one on the right, now.
