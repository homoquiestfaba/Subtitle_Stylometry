1
00:00:01,379 --> 00:00:03,962
(gentle music)

2
00:00:13,229 --> 00:00:15,812
(upbeat music)

3
00:00:17,682 --> 00:00:20,765
(seagulls squawking)

4
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:40,470
- [Al] I work for the New
York State Tax Department,

5
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:42,720
which is the single worst
job you could possibly have.

6
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:46,113
I mean, let's face it,
everybody hates the tax man.

7
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:48,363
It's biblical.

8
00:00:49,507 --> 00:00:52,424
(group chattering)

9
00:00:54,287 --> 00:00:57,037
(brooding music)

10
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:03,753
There were rumors in the
Brighton Beach Russian community

11
00:01:03,753 --> 00:01:05,190
that a mysterious money guy

12
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:07,503
had put together a
multimillion dollar scam.

13
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:11,370
I guess I could have sat
on my ass in my office

14
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:14,700
doing crossword puzzles,
shaking down little shopkeepers

15
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,890
who were later on their sales tax,

16
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:18,240
but I would've gone insane.

17
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,650
So I hit the streets looking for something

18
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:28,140
that would get me outta bed every morning,

19
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,993
something that could change my life.

20
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:35,010
And I figured that
finding this mystery man

21
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:36,153
could be my big break.

22
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:41,460
(camera snaps)

23
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:44,940
One of my prime suspects was
a fellow named Grisha Gold,

24
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:48,090
president of a small
gasoline company Mars.

25
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:49,470
He was only in the country two years

26
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:51,630
already acting like a regular Rockefeller,

27
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:54,981
buying up large numbers of
independent gas stations.

28
00:01:54,981 --> 00:01:56,374
(camera snaps)

29
00:01:56,374 --> 00:01:59,224
(man speaking in Russian)

30
00:01:59,224 --> 00:02:02,148
(man 2 speaking in Russian)

31
00:02:02,148 --> 00:02:05,238
(man singing in foreign language)

32
00:02:05,238 --> 00:02:08,177
(car door bangs)

33
00:02:08,177 --> 00:02:10,950
I was also following Gold's employees

34
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:12,363
hoping to stumble on a lead.

35
00:02:13,232 --> 00:02:15,470
(man speaking in Russian)

36
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:17,909
(car engine roaring)

37
00:02:17,909 --> 00:02:20,826
(tires screeching)

38
00:02:22,137 --> 00:02:24,527
Go, go, go, go for Christ sake.

39
00:02:24,527 --> 00:02:28,050
(car engine roaring)

40
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:29,400
- Seven Charlie, this is Central.

41
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:33,446
We got a 1020 at 1430
Brighton Sixth Street, repeat.

42
00:02:33,446 --> 00:02:37,380
(police radio chattering)

43
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:39,390
Seven, this is Central, we got a 1010.

44
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:42,600
Shots fired at 1350 Brighton
Beach Avenue at Mars.

45
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,698
Acronym from Metropolitan
and Malcolm Refinery Service.

46
00:02:45,698 --> 00:02:48,266
(siren wailing)
(police radio chattering)

47
00:02:48,266 --> 00:02:50,711
(group chattering)

48
00:02:50,711 --> 00:02:53,461
(car door bangs)

49
00:02:55,158 --> 00:02:56,749
- [Reporter] Anderson, Brighton Beach.

50
00:02:56,749 --> 00:02:58,744
I am outside the small tucked away office

51
00:02:58,744 --> 00:03:00,377
of a local petroleum organization.

52
00:03:00,377 --> 00:03:01,499
- Excuse me, please.
- Called Mars.

53
00:03:01,499 --> 00:03:02,332
- Excuse me.
- What the fuck

54
00:03:02,332 --> 00:03:03,165
is with you people?

55
00:03:03,165 --> 00:03:04,260
Whose fucking cigarette is this?

56
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:07,053
What are you smoking a
goddamn dead men's cigarettes?

57
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:09,360
Don't fucking look at me.

58
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,285
Take the goddamn pictures.

59
00:03:11,285 --> 00:03:12,663
Jesus.

60
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,533
All right, who's collecting shells?

61
00:03:16,628 --> 00:03:18,210
Who is collecting shells?

62
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:19,610
Am I talking to myself here?

63
00:03:22,171 --> 00:03:23,004
Look at this.

64
00:03:23,004 --> 00:03:23,837
Jesus.

65
00:03:23,837 --> 00:03:25,500
This is all these fucking
people think about.

66
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,940
They got no morality.

67
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:30,217
They're just godforsaken fucking commies.

68
00:03:30,217 --> 00:03:31,400
Should've fucking dropped a bomb

69
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,161
on the whole fucking country.

70
00:03:33,161 --> 00:03:38,161
- This says. (speaking in Russian)

71
00:03:40,847 --> 00:03:42,810
It's a sales journal.

72
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:43,960
- Hey, Phil, come here.

73
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:48,023
Look at this.

74
00:03:48,023 --> 00:03:49,230
Probably somebody doing business.

75
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:50,580
- [Phil] Made a robbery on the wall.

76
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:52,530
- [Nunzio] These people could
be involved with night clubs.

77
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:55,107
- [Phil] Maybe they got
extorted and they wouldn't pay.

78
00:03:57,146 --> 00:03:58,896
- Hey, hey, watch it.

79
00:04:01,636 --> 00:04:03,163
- Excuse me.
- Hey, hey, I told you people,

80
00:04:03,163 --> 00:04:05,880
I have as much right to be
here as you do, all right?

81
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,410
- I'm sure you do.

82
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:08,790
Joseph Romero.

83
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,320
- Oh, sorry.

84
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,420
Al Benjamin, state tax.

85
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:13,270
What a mess, huh?

86
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:15,143
- Yeah.

87
00:04:15,143 --> 00:04:16,530
- Somebody gonna really feel stupid.

88
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:18,510
- Somebody?
- Yeah, my boss.

89
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:20,370
I've been sitting on these
people five months now.

90
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:21,203
But you guys, anyway,

91
00:04:21,203 --> 00:04:22,680
you're gonna be putting
together a case now,

92
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,630
and I figure I can show you my notes,

93
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:25,710
my surveillance photos.

94
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:29,340
- Oh, these guys are just,
they're just in, in gasoline.

95
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:30,870
Nothing bigger than that.

96
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:31,703
- Yeah, I know.

97
00:04:31,703 --> 00:04:34,050
And I know six people, you
think they get slaughtered

98
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:35,880
over, over drugs something, right?

99
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,503
Nothing as common as gasoline.

100
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:40,140
Let me, let me show you this.

101
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:40,973
Did you see this?

102
00:04:40,973 --> 00:04:41,806
This is weird.

103
00:04:41,806 --> 00:04:42,930
This place is called Mars,

104
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:45,000
but the invoice is made
out to another company.

105
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,310
Company I never heard
of, El Dorado Petroleum.

106
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:49,770
Geofuel's a huge Fortune 500 company.

107
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:50,760
Look.

108
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,960
Look at these numbers.

109
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,208
- Who the fuck is this guy?

110
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:54,090
- [Al] This is good.

111
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:55,830
- Hey, what the fuck are you doing?

112
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:57,570
Put that down, that's evidence
hasn't been dusted yet.

113
00:04:57,570 --> 00:04:58,467
Who the are you anyway?

114
00:04:58,467 --> 00:04:59,730
- He, he, he's been-

115
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:01,290
- Yeah, wise guy.

116
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:02,970
Are you homo-homo-homicide?

117
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:03,803
You're down here

118
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:05,100
because you speak a
little Russian, all right?

119
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,210
So mind your own fucking business.

120
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:07,043
Keep out of the way.

121
00:05:07,043 --> 00:05:09,690
You're here to interpret, not investigate.

122
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:10,523
Phil, come here.

123
00:05:12,303 --> 00:05:13,200
You're a tax collector.

124
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:16,040
This is a homicide investigation,
you don't belong here.

125
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,220
If you came the audit these guys,

126
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,455
I'd say you were a little late.

127
00:05:18,455 --> 00:05:19,288
(Phil laughs)

128
00:05:19,288 --> 00:05:21,870
- I, I don't, I don't do audits, okay?

129
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:23,040
I'm an investigator.

130
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,960
I'm investigating a crime just like you.

131
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,353
- I don't want a fucking
argument from you.

132
00:05:26,353 --> 00:05:27,992
I want you outta here now.

133
00:05:27,992 --> 00:05:28,825
- Don't touch me.

134
00:05:28,825 --> 00:05:30,030
- Get this desk jockey
the fuck out of here.

135
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:30,936
- Let me tell you something.

136
00:05:30,936 --> 00:05:31,769
- Hey, you get outta here this minute.

137
00:05:31,769 --> 00:05:32,602
I'll lock your ass up

138
00:05:32,602 --> 00:05:34,409
you little fucking tax
collector cocksucker!

139
00:05:34,409 --> 00:05:36,360
- Tax investigator, all right?

140
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,923
- Get the fuck out of here.
- Investigator, all right?

141
00:05:38,923 --> 00:05:40,626
- [Man] Hey, lady, watch it, huh!

142
00:05:40,626 --> 00:05:41,623
- [Woman] Hey, take a hike!

143
00:05:41,623 --> 00:05:43,260
- I got six dead bodies.

144
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:46,715
I got two invoices that are
potentially hard evidence-

145
00:05:46,715 --> 00:05:49,530
- Six frickin' homicides
here, Al, remember?

146
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:50,444
- Five months I've been-
- This case.

147
00:05:50,444 --> 00:05:51,277
- Working on this right?

148
00:05:51,277 --> 00:05:52,470
- Yeah, five months on a mythical case

149
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:53,370
you keep telling me about.

150
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:55,080
And every time I keep asking you, you say,

151
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,220
well, I'm not sure what the case is.

152
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,300
- Well, now I'm sure.
- And quite honestly,

153
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:58,320
I'm sick and fucking tired-

154
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,970
- Now I'm sure.
- Of you charging windmills

155
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:01,680
instead of doing you goddamn job!

156
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,057
- Yeah, hello, it's Al
Benjamin, state tax.

157
00:06:03,057 --> 00:06:05,460
Look, I need papers and incorporation

158
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:08,043
for a company called El Dorado Petroleum.

159
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:10,380
More importantly,

160
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:14,760
uh, I need to know who the
corporation officers are.

161
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:17,100
- [Clerk] The officers
of El Dorado Petroleum.

162
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,120
- Right.

163
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,070
- [Clerk] I have to send it
out by mail you now, sir.

164
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:22,420
- [Al] Is there any chance
I can get it sooner?

165
00:06:23,291 --> 00:06:26,250
(train rattling)

166
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:27,973
- [Announcer] Next stop North Paige.

167
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:31,565
Next stop Brighton Paige.

168
00:06:31,565 --> 00:06:34,530
(birds chirping)

169
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:36,610
- How you doing today?

170
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:38,442
- How you doing?

171
00:06:38,442 --> 00:06:39,275
- I'm doing all right.

172
00:06:39,275 --> 00:06:40,890
Listen, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm,

173
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:43,890
I'm really sorry about,
about the episode yesterday.

174
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:46,950
You know, my captain can be
kind of a dick, you know?

175
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:47,970
- Kind of a dick?
- Yeah.

176
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:49,830
- The guy should be fitted for a rubber.

177
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:52,050
- Yeah, um, don't take it personally.

178
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:54,113
You know, he's like that
with everybody, and, and-

179
00:06:54,113 --> 00:06:56,040
- Look, I know why you're here, okay?

180
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,960
Your boss, he finally figures out

181
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,970
that maybe I know something after all,

182
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:01,680
so he sends you to pick my brain.

183
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,270
He's too fucking
embarrassed to come to me.

184
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:04,680
But you tell him it's too late, all right?

185
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,513
- No, no, you don't-
- Tell him he can-

186
00:07:05,513 --> 00:07:06,870
- Understand.
- Kiss my tuchus.

187
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:07,927
- Your what?
- My tuchus.

188
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,873
Tell him to kiss my ass, all right?

189
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,120
- All all right, I'll tell him but-

190
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,500
- Yeah, you tell him that.

191
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,030
- I came here, I just want you to know

192
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:18,540
I came here on my own. I
mean, I mean, no one sent me.

193
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:19,893
I, I, I'm-
- What?

194
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:22,050
- I came here on my own.

195
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:23,940
No own sent-
- He doesn't know you're here?

196
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:26,047
- No, this is, this is
totally unauthorized.

197
00:07:26,047 --> 00:07:30,480
And, and, and, and, and what
you said last night, it was,

198
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,918
I thought it was very interesting.

199
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:34,290
And, and, and I thought maybe
I can come down here and, and,

200
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:36,957
and talk to you and, and, you
know, jump in with you and,

201
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:37,917
and see where it goes.

202
00:07:37,917 --> 00:07:38,850
- [Al] Jump in where?

203
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:40,099
- [Joseph] I can translate for you.

204
00:07:40,099 --> 00:07:40,932
- I don't need a translator.
- I've been taking

205
00:07:40,932 --> 00:07:42,060
Russian classes.
- By the way,

206
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,680
what's a DOA guy?

207
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,420
- When homicide comes in and
cleans out the crime scene

208
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:47,880
I, I, I, I make sure
no one molest the body.

209
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:48,713
- Molest the body?

210
00:07:48,713 --> 00:07:50,670
You mean somebody wants to
sleep with a dead person?

211
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:53,130
- No, you know, sometimes
freaking wanna come in

212
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:54,130
and, and, and rob the guy and I-

213
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:55,110
- Oh.
- I make sure that-

214
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:56,070
- Shitty job.

215
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:57,360
- Yeah, you're telling me.

216
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,580
Anyways, look, there's
gonna be tons of paperwork.

217
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:00,870
I can organize it for you.

218
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:02,940
I can run plates for you when I'm on duty.

219
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,950
- I can run plates myself.
- And, and, I'm really smart.

220
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:05,783
I got best marks at the academy-

221
00:08:05,783 --> 00:08:07,089
- That's nice.
- On all my written tests.

222
00:08:07,089 --> 00:08:08,146
- What the hell are you doing

223
00:08:08,146 --> 00:08:09,570
with the worst job in the precinct?

224
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:10,403
- I don't know, maybe they don't

225
00:08:10,403 --> 00:08:11,337
like Puerto Ricans or something.

226
00:08:11,337 --> 00:08:12,170
- Oh, bullshit.

227
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:13,380
You're telling me there's
no Puerto Rican detectives.

228
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:14,910
You fucked up.
- No, I did not.

229
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:16,020
- You fucked up.

230
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:16,860
- I didn't fuck up.

231
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:19,230
All right, so there's a couple
things I didn't do so good.

232
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:20,550
- Like what?

233
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:22,050
- I have a hard time hitting the target

234
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:24,240
and, and, and, and I don't drive so well.

235
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,110
- Oh, great, great.

236
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:26,430
You can't shoot, you can't drive.

237
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:27,671
Is there anything else you can't do?

238
00:08:27,671 --> 00:08:32,062
(woman speaking in Russian)

239
00:08:32,062 --> 00:08:35,478
(speaking in Russian)

240
00:08:35,478 --> 00:08:37,230
Okay, show me some Russian.

241
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:38,140
What she saying?

242
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:39,600
(woman speaking in foreign language)

243
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,427
- She's saying that he cheated on her

244
00:08:42,427 --> 00:08:44,075
and, and, and he broke her heart.

245
00:08:44,075 --> 00:08:47,307
(woman speaking in Russian)

246
00:08:47,307 --> 00:08:48,810
(man speaking in Russian)

247
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:51,120
- Imagine being with a woman like that.

248
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,330
- Nah, she'd scare the hell out of me.

249
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:55,980
I want, I want a nice, nice Catholic girl.

250
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,330
You know, a virgin.

251
00:08:57,330 --> 00:08:59,274
Hey, you don't want, you don't
want to get involved in that.

252
00:08:59,274 --> 00:09:00,107
- Hey, hey, hey!

253
00:09:00,107 --> 00:09:02,910
Take it, take it, take it easy, all right?

254
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:03,757
Take it easy.

255
00:09:03,757 --> 00:09:06,540
- Mind your fucking business,
this is my fucking fiance.

256
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:07,440
- All right, take it easy.

257
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,606
I just don't want to-
- Would you please

258
00:09:08,606 --> 00:09:09,723
mind your own business, please?

259
00:09:09,723 --> 00:09:11,520
- Just take it easy, all right?

260
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,900
Looks like you're gonna hurt her.

261
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:13,733
Calm down.

262
00:09:13,733 --> 00:09:15,510
- What do you think I
can't take care of myself?

263
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:16,343
Please.

264
00:09:17,942 --> 00:09:21,109
(speaking in Russian)

265
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,433
- Sorry.

266
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:32,010
What are you gonna do, right?

267
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:33,960
- You always do crazy things like that?

268
00:09:34,998 --> 00:09:35,831
- What do you mean?

269
00:09:35,831 --> 00:09:38,213
What's crazy about hopping
out a woman that's in trouble?

270
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:41,700
- So what about it?

271
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:42,533
- What?

272
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:45,960
- You and me working
on the case, you know,

273
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,163
Sherlock and Watson.

274
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:51,763
- You mean more like Abbott and Costello.

275
00:09:51,763 --> 00:09:54,680
(group chattering)

276
00:09:56,201 --> 00:09:58,050
So wanna know why six people

277
00:09:58,050 --> 00:09:59,430
got themselves killed over something

278
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:00,783
as common as gasoline?

279
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:02,693
- Yeah.

280
00:10:03,965 --> 00:10:07,230
- Well, it's not the gasoline people

281
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:08,430
are getting killed over.

282
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:12,570
It's the taxes.

283
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:14,010
Some criminal mastermind figured out

284
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:16,170
how to steal taxes off gasoline.

285
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:17,627
- But that's only a few
cents a gallon, right?

286
00:10:17,627 --> 00:10:20,070
- Right, right, 27 cents to be exact.

287
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:24,030
But if you figure that
the average gas station

288
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:26,040
sells 10,000 gallons a day,

289
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,833
well that's almost a million
dollars a year in taxes.

290
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,740
And let's suppose a crime organization

291
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,690
owns a hundred gas stations.

292
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:36,840
That's a hundred million
dollars a year pure profit.

293
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,220
Now ain't that a motive for murder?

294
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,916
- Yeah, but how are they,
how are they doing it,

295
00:10:39,916 --> 00:10:41,610
the, the stealing part?

296
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:42,993
- Well, I don't know.

297
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,172
That's what we gotta figure out.

298
00:10:46,172 --> 00:10:47,005
(brooding music)

299
00:10:47,005 --> 00:10:49,290
(man speaking in foreign language)

300
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:52,530
The six murders at Mars did
not slow the rapid expansion

301
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:54,303
of their gas station empire.

302
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:59,280
Within a week, they set up a
shop in a dumpy back office

303
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,380
at one of their gas stations.

304
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:03,750
I was wondering if whoever
killed these people

305
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,700
would make another move.

306
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:06,533
What?

307
00:11:06,533 --> 00:11:07,760
- It's just me.

308
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,390
(car door clicks)

309
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:11,490
What are you a scaredy cat?

310
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:13,320
Man, at the deli there
was this blonde lady

311
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,281
with nice big vavooms.

312
00:11:15,281 --> 00:11:16,710
- Wait a minute, wait a minute.

313
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:18,360
Vavooms?

314
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,610
- Yeah, you know vavooms.

315
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:22,122
- I know what vavooms are.

316
00:11:22,122 --> 00:11:22,955
(gentle brooding music)

317
00:11:22,955 --> 00:11:23,853
Look at these guys.

318
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:26,373
Telling you something's up.

319
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:31,170
New guy running Mars was a
character called Topolev.

320
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:32,700
He used to work for Gold

321
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,320
and just happened to be out of the office

322
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,970
at the time of the killings.

323
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:37,650
Now this guy was either very lucky,

324
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:40,200
or maybe the late Grisha Gold trusted him

325
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,733
just a little too much.

326
00:11:43,433 --> 00:11:45,480
Topolev spent most of his time

327
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:48,360
going to small independent gas stations

328
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,340
offering to buy them out.

329
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:52,380
And just like I figured,

330
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:54,420
the more gas stations you have,

331
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,193
the more taxes you can steal.

332
00:11:57,146 --> 00:11:58,724
(car door clicks)
(car door bangs)

333
00:11:58,724 --> 00:12:03,724
(car door bangs)
(camera clicks)

334
00:12:03,741 --> 00:12:06,602
(Abrasha speaking in Russian)

335
00:12:06,602 --> 00:12:08,918
(Andre speaking in Russian)

336
00:12:08,918 --> 00:12:12,751
(Abrasha speaking in Russian)

337
00:12:15,414 --> 00:12:19,081
(Andre speaking in Russian)

338
00:12:21,678 --> 00:12:24,428
(drill whirring)

339
00:12:27,637 --> 00:12:29,486
(group chattering)

340
00:12:29,486 --> 00:12:31,590
All right, Mr. Vavoom,
the mail just got here.

341
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:32,480
- [Joseph] Stop calling me that.

342
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,673
- (chuckles) And the drum roll please.

343
00:12:38,695 --> 00:12:41,170
I think we got ourselves a president.

344
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:44,183
Oh, that's strange.

345
00:12:44,183 --> 00:12:45,427
- What?

346
00:12:45,427 --> 00:12:48,660
- [Al] El Dorado, it only
has one corporate officer.

347
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:49,500
- [Joseph] What's his name, Al?

348
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,923
- Uh, one Misha Baruchin.

349
00:12:54,243 --> 00:12:55,890
- It's Misha Baruchin, Al.

350
00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:57,282
It's pronounced Baruchin.

351
00:12:57,282 --> 00:12:58,350
- Well, thank you Mr. Berlitz.

352
00:12:58,350 --> 00:12:59,880
This could be our guy.

353
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,380
All right, look, I got an address

354
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:02,790
on the corporation headquarters.

355
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:05,610
It's 121 16th Street in Brooklyn.

356
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:06,570
I'm gonna go over there now.

357
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:07,980
This could be everything, baby.

358
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:09,094
- Wait, wait.

359
00:13:09,094 --> 00:13:10,528
You can't go without me, come on.

360
00:13:10,528 --> 00:13:12,305
I can't get outta here right now.

361
00:13:12,305 --> 00:13:14,565
And, and, and, and I
got a day off tomorrow.

362
00:13:14,565 --> 00:13:17,365
We can go tomorrow.

363
00:13:17,365 --> 00:13:19,180
Come on, Al, we're in this together now.

364
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:20,337
- Hey.

365
00:13:20,337 --> 00:13:21,933
Not a personal call I hope.

366
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:23,693
- No, sir.

367
00:13:23,693 --> 00:13:25,980
- Here's a buck, got to the
machine, get me a coffee.

368
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:26,910
Light two sugars.

369
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:28,680
Can you handle that without fucking up?

370
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,819
- Yes, sir, in a minute.

371
00:13:29,819 --> 00:13:31,279
- [Nunzio] Hey, Donnie,
leave a message for my wife.

372
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:32,864
(traffic humming)

373
00:13:32,864 --> 00:13:34,200
- [Joseph] So what do you think

374
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,420
this Misha Barucin's gonna be like?

375
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:37,253
- I don't know.

376
00:13:37,253 --> 00:13:38,670
But he's gonna be surprised to see us.

377
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:40,470
And I'll tell you something else.

378
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:42,690
I bet their offices
are waist deep in cash.

379
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:44,040
We're gonna need a fucking life preserver

380
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,240
just to swim through it.

381
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:50,520
- So with all the, with
all this cash, I mean,

382
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,260
you think there's gonna be
a lot of guns and stuff?

383
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:55,230
I mean, 'cause I didn't bring
my bulletproof vest and-

384
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:56,063
- Vests?

385
00:13:56,063 --> 00:13:58,380
We don't need no stinking vests.

386
00:13:58,380 --> 00:13:59,730
Why do you wanna be a cop anyway?

387
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:01,050
I mean, you worry all the time.

388
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:03,030
You're a smart guy, you could be a CPA.

389
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:04,710
You could make a lot more money.

390
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:05,880
- [Joseph] You sound like my mother.

391
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:08,010
We're looking for 121, right?

392
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:10,260
- Uh.
- 127.

393
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:11,528
- [Al] You sure this is the right street?

394
00:14:11,528 --> 00:14:12,445
- 125, 123.

395
00:14:15,934 --> 00:14:17,970
Here, 119.
- 119.

396
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:20,090
- Wait, stop, stop.

397
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:21,881
Back it up, back up.

398
00:14:21,881 --> 00:14:22,714
That's it.

399
00:14:28,335 --> 00:14:29,168
- 119.

400
00:14:31,439 --> 00:14:32,669
Fuck.

401
00:14:32,669 --> 00:14:33,669
- That's it.

402
00:14:35,119 --> 00:14:36,387
(car door clicks)

403
00:14:36,387 --> 00:14:38,975
(man speaking in Russian)

404
00:14:38,975 --> 00:14:40,577
(car door bangs)

405
00:14:40,577 --> 00:14:43,320
(car door bangs)

406
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,503
- These guys are a lot
smarter than I thought.

407
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:48,243
A lot smarter.

408
00:14:49,762 --> 00:14:53,262
(man speaking in Russian)

409
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:59,133
They got a whole corporation
registered to an empty lot.

410
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:03,103
This Misha Baruchin is
our mystery man all right.

411
00:15:03,103 --> 00:15:05,800
6,600 state employees
in the tax department

412
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:09,922
and that one person thought to check.

413
00:15:09,922 --> 00:15:11,070
(thunder rumbling)

414
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:12,250
I can't understand why Geofuel

415
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:15,390
would do business with a phantom company.

416
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:16,263
- That's creepy.

417
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:22,973
- Bingo.

418
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,220
Double bingo, baby.

419
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:28,950
Look what I just pulled out
of Brooklyn Surrogate Court.

420
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:31,502
El Dorado purchase deeds.

421
00:15:31,502 --> 00:15:32,760
- Oh, wow.

422
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:35,763
- 380 count 'em gas stations.

423
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:39,215
- And you know who sold
them those gas stations?

424
00:15:39,215 --> 00:15:41,314
- Geofuel, yeah, yeah.
- Geofuel.

425
00:15:41,314 --> 00:15:42,630
So what we got here

426
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:45,780
is a financially troubled
large corporation.

427
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:48,120
- Right.
- Who's trying to save itself.

428
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,220
They sell their stations to Misha,

429
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:53,190
he transfers ownership
of the stations to Mars.

430
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:56,098
So if his tax scam is uncovered,
he can't be implicated.

431
00:15:56,098 --> 00:15:57,540
- Yes.

432
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:00,300
I can see the press conference now.

433
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:04,350
Headlines read, NYPD joker, tax man

434
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:06,630
topple vicious Russian crime circuit.

435
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:09,733
- All right, but hold off
with the toppling, okay.

436
00:16:09,733 --> 00:16:11,880
So Geofuel keeps supplying gasoline

437
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:14,130
even though they know El
Dorado's a phantom company

438
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:16,170
because Misha probably cuts
them in on the profits.

439
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:18,570
- Right, right, right.
- This Misha's a genius.

440
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,260
- [Al] I was feeling great.

441
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:23,823
Best I've felt in years.

442
00:16:24,727 --> 00:16:26,480
- [Reporter] Benjamin, Benjamin, please.

443
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,950
(cameras snapping)
(group chattering)

444
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:30,208
Over here please, sir.

445
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:32,208
- [Reporter 2] Benjamin!

446
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:35,910
- [Al] So I pull up,

447
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:38,853
I see Geofuel barges
offloading into Mars trucks.

448
00:16:42,977 --> 00:16:46,380
I say to myself, wow, the
vavoom-meister's absolutely right.

449
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,750
Geofuel's supplying Mars with gasoline,

450
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:51,630
but they're invoicing El Dorado Petroleum.

451
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:54,180
So on paper, there's never any connection

452
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,743
between Geofuel and Mars.

453
00:16:57,690 --> 00:16:59,790
I went to see the
Geofuel terminal manager,

454
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:02,520
but he was way too busy to see me.

455
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,440
So I said, fine.

456
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,583
I'll subpoena his ass.

457
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:10,619
(door creaking)

458
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:12,660
- [Boss] Get him out of here, Neals!

459
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:13,850
(Al yelling)

460
00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:16,710
- [Al] In my office none of
my bosses would back me up.

461
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:18,870
They wouldn't issue a subpoena.

462
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:21,390
Nobody wanted to take on Geofuel.

463
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:24,150
I get into a huge fight, but
it didn't do me any good.

464
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:25,590
- Get out of here.

465
00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:27,066
Jules Pfizer runs this whole place.

466
00:17:27,066 --> 00:17:28,383
Shut the fuck up.

467
00:17:28,383 --> 00:17:29,350
- Not bailing my case.

468
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:31,710
- Al, I said, shut the fuck up.

469
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:32,543
It's just work.

470
00:17:32,543 --> 00:17:33,990
It does not matter.
- Just work?

471
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:35,140
- Yeah, it's just work.

472
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:36,370
- Mike, six people got killed-

473
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:37,890
- Jesus Christ!
- At Mars, okay?

474
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,570
Six. You're telling me
that doesn't matter, right?

475
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:41,220
- Six Russians died-
- What about the-

476
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:42,720
- And yes, Al, it does not matter.

477
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,190
Six Russians that doesn't matter.

478
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:45,270
Now grow the fuck up!

479
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:46,560
- Let me tell you something, all right?

480
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,700
When I was a kid growing up,

481
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:48,780
you think I wanted this?

482
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:50,550
You think think I wanted to be a tax man?

483
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:52,650
Fuck no, but that's what I am, all right.

484
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:53,607
That's what I do.

485
00:17:53,607 --> 00:17:55,470
And you think I'm gonna
take this fucking shit?

486
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:56,303
You're crazy.

487
00:17:56,303 --> 00:17:57,660
- Al, go home.

488
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,520
You've been talking about
fixing that debt for five years.

489
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,643
Take a week, hell take two weeks off.

490
00:18:00,643 --> 00:18:01,476
- Fucking bullshit.

491
00:18:01,476 --> 00:18:02,603
- God knows how much time you've saved up.

492
00:18:02,603 --> 00:18:04,290
And you haven't even used the vacation.

493
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:05,123
- Hey, yo, watch where you're going man.

494
00:18:05,123 --> 00:18:07,788
- Get on the freaking street.
- How you doing again, sir?

495
00:18:07,788 --> 00:18:08,917
- Not a bike path.
- How you doing today, sir?

496
00:18:08,917 --> 00:18:11,250
Wanna try, take a look over
here, sir. Huh, 20 bucks, sir.

497
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:12,510
- Leather jacket for you bro, huh?

498
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:14,124
- Hey, yo, you want a magazine, man.

499
00:18:14,124 --> 00:18:14,957
Punk ass.

500
00:18:16,287 --> 00:18:17,455
- I can't get through.

501
00:18:17,455 --> 00:18:19,455
- What's this guy doing?

502
00:18:20,335 --> 00:18:22,570
- Street work, don't
you see we're working?

503
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:25,230
- Hey this is a sidewalk, okay?

504
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:27,322
- Who the fuck asked you?
- Sidewalk is for pedestrians.

505
00:18:27,322 --> 00:18:28,834
Move the boxes.

506
00:18:28,834 --> 00:18:29,667
- Fuck that.

507
00:18:29,667 --> 00:18:30,854
- Move the boxes, it's illegal.

508
00:18:30,854 --> 00:18:31,934
You're breaking the law, it's illegal.

509
00:18:31,934 --> 00:18:33,510
- Who gives a shit, fucking asshole?

510
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:34,530
- Who are you calling an asshole?

511
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:35,520
- You!
- Who's gonna move the boxes?

512
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,353
You or me?

513
00:18:36,353 --> 00:18:37,186
- Nobody, walk.

514
00:18:39,322 --> 00:18:41,368
(glass shattering)

515
00:18:41,368 --> 00:18:42,535
- [Al] Move the box.

516
00:18:42,535 --> 00:18:43,650
- [Man] What are you fucking nuts?

517
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:45,228
- [Al] Move the box!

518
00:18:45,228 --> 00:18:46,679
(bodies thud)

519
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:48,819
Move the box, goddammit!
- No, no, no, no!

520
00:18:48,819 --> 00:18:50,040
Fucking crazy!

521
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,510
Stop!

522
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:52,984
- I work for the people goddammit!

523
00:18:52,984 --> 00:18:54,210
- Stop it!
- I work for the people!

524
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:55,351
- What are you nuts?
- You're a street,

525
00:18:55,351 --> 00:18:56,184
you hear me?

526
00:18:56,184 --> 00:18:57,833
You're all fucking streets!

527
00:18:57,833 --> 00:19:01,320
You're all fucking streets!
- I said stop it!

528
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:04,020
- [Al] My once in lifetime
big break was dying on me.

529
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:06,368
And only a miracle could save it.

530
00:19:06,368 --> 00:19:08,010
(group chattering)
(upbeat music)

531
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:10,740
My miracle was a guy called Andre.

532
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:14,490
He owned 16 gas stations and
was like some kind of papa bear

533
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:16,230
for the people who worked for him.

534
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:18,000
If somebody had a sick wife

535
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,460
or kid in college needed some extra money,

536
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,020
he'd take care of it for him.

537
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:23,640
- How's the baby?
- Fine.

538
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,080
- Your wife, she get enough help?

539
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,007
- Yeah, she okay.

540
00:19:26,007 --> 00:19:28,440
- If you have to go home
early you just tell me.

541
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,740
There's no trouble, no problem, okay?

542
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:31,419
- Okay, Andre.
- Okay.

543
00:19:31,419 --> 00:19:32,252
- Thank you.

544
00:19:32,252 --> 00:19:34,230
(water splashing)

545
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:37,560
- [Al] This guy could teach
a class on how to enjoy life.

546
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,870
He'd make his rounds to
all the gas stations,

547
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:41,190
collect the cash,

548
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:43,680
then he'd head right to the
Russian baths for a swim.

549
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,330
Rub down, maybe a little borscht.

550
00:19:49,431 --> 00:19:51,251
(Andre speaks in Russian)

551
00:19:51,251 --> 00:19:54,751
(men speaking in Russian)

552
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:58,790
- So you want to hear joke?

553
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:01,253
Funny joke?

554
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,683
What has six balls and fucks you?

555
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:07,150
Lotto.

556
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:10,733
(woman and Andre laughing)

557
00:20:15,427 --> 00:20:18,344
(group chattering)

558
00:20:20,577 --> 00:20:22,795
(laughing) Lotto.

559
00:20:22,795 --> 00:20:25,545
(Andre laughing)

560
00:20:26,587 --> 00:20:27,737
(woman screams)

561
00:20:27,737 --> 00:20:30,720
(gun banging)
(Andre groaning)

562
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,005
(glass shattering)

563
00:20:33,005 --> 00:20:33,838
(Andre grunts)
(coffee splashes)

564
00:20:33,838 --> 00:20:35,158
(man screams)

565
00:20:35,158 --> 00:20:36,100
(man grunting)

566
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:38,704
(gun clangs)
(Andre grunting)

567
00:20:38,704 --> 00:20:40,769
(water splashing)
(gun banging)

568
00:20:40,769 --> 00:20:42,512
(man speaking in Russian)

569
00:20:42,512 --> 00:20:43,560
(gun clicking)

570
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,600
- [Al] Andre was shot three times.

571
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,740
Later he said, "The bullets

572
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:49,500
got lost in 220 pounds of Russian muscle."

573
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,660
Somehow he was able to survive.

574
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,130
The interesting thing was,

575
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:55,830
ballistics show that the
bullets removed from Andre

576
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:58,780
were fired from the same weapons
used as the Mars killings.

577
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,950
Romero IDed Andre from
my surveillance photo

578
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:05,400
as one of the guys that Topolev
was trying to muscle out.

579
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:08,253
Romero also said he could
finagle me into seeing Andre.

580
00:21:10,618 --> 00:21:11,670
(car door bangs)

581
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:12,750
- [Joseph] So how you been?

582
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:14,190
- Um, lousy.

583
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:16,320
Really depressed, you
know, suicidal at times.

584
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,370
But tell you the truth,

585
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:20,220
I didn't even think I ever see you again.

586
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:24,360
- Yeah, well, nobody's
embarrassed me for a whole week.

587
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,740
(Al chuckles)

588
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:27,063
Guess I'm a masochist.

589
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:28,943
So, oh, you know what?

590
00:21:28,943 --> 00:21:30,150
I gotta, I was running late.

591
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:31,380
I didn't have a chance to change.

592
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:33,900
And I don't want to go in there like this.

593
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:38,900
So, you know, pull up somewhere.

594
00:21:39,318 --> 00:21:41,220
- No, change in the car.

595
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:43,164
- This car's filthy, I'm
not gonna change in here.

596
00:21:43,164 --> 00:21:44,040
- No, change-

597
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,873
- Just pull up somewhere,
a restaurant or something.

598
00:21:45,873 --> 00:21:48,373
- What you're afraid I'm
gonna like get turned on?

599
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:52,410
- Are you saying something here, Al?

600
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:53,640
- What?

601
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,214
- Because I don't think it's very funny.

602
00:21:55,214 --> 00:21:57,060
(Al laughing)

603
00:21:57,060 --> 00:22:00,060
- What do you think I think
you're a pillow biter?

604
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:02,850
- Hey, lots of guys don't
like to take their clothes off

605
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:04,050
in front of other guys.

606
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:07,834
I mean, I mean, who wants
to see what another guy's,

607
00:22:07,834 --> 00:22:09,693
what another guy's got?
- For what it's worth-

608
00:22:09,693 --> 00:22:12,150
- And, and, and-
- It wouldn't bother me.

609
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:14,900
Wouldn't bother me if you
were gay for what it's worth.

610
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:18,473
- Kiss my tacos, Al.

611
00:22:18,473 --> 00:22:19,980
- Tuchus, tuchus.

612
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:22,130
How many times they
gonna tell you, shmuck?

613
00:22:24,268 --> 00:22:27,120
- You know, you're very,
very emotionally disturbed.

614
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,331
- Thanks for noticing.

615
00:22:28,331 --> 00:22:31,140
Ah, so what a blow job's
out of the question?

616
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:32,520
- That's not funny, Al.

617
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,521
I'm serious.

618
00:22:33,521 --> 00:22:34,593
(Al laughing)

619
00:22:34,593 --> 00:22:35,620
(slow tempo brooding music)

620
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:39,203
(Andre speaking in Russian)

621
00:22:39,203 --> 00:22:42,060
(Nadia speaking in Russian)

622
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:46,103
Mr. Rubakov. (speaking in Russian)

623
00:22:49,146 --> 00:22:51,511
(Andre speaking in Russian)

624
00:22:51,511 --> 00:22:53,361
- Al Benjamin.
- His daughter Nadia.

625
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:55,493
- Hi.

626
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:59,730
- I remember you, the boardwalk.

627
00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:00,570
- Right, right.

628
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:01,570
You still mad at me?

629
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:04,290
- You know my daughter?

630
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:05,190
- No, not really.

631
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:07,803
I mean, we, well, we met, but not.

632
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:11,590
(Andre coughing)

633
00:23:12,832 --> 00:23:15,450
(Nadia speaking in Russian)

634
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:16,963
- [Joseph] Al, she wants us to leave.

635
00:23:16,963 --> 00:23:18,150
- Look, look, I just,

636
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:19,650
I wanna ask him a couple of questions.

637
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:21,993
I'm not gonna tire you out, promise.

638
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,983
So, so where are you from in Russia?

639
00:23:28,568 --> 00:23:29,702
- Kyiv.

640
00:23:29,702 --> 00:23:30,960
- Kyiv, (chuckles)

641
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:31,793
Kyiv.

642
00:23:31,793 --> 00:23:36,186
Joe, my grandfather on my
mother's side is from Kyiv.

643
00:23:36,186 --> 00:23:37,019
Kyiv.

644
00:23:37,019 --> 00:23:38,913
Man, he was a tailor in the Czar's army.

645
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:42,717
So listen, if you don't mind, I,

646
00:23:42,717 --> 00:23:44,967
I'd really like to talk
to your father alone.

647
00:23:46,603 --> 00:23:49,560
(Joseph speaking in Russian)

648
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:51,030
Yeah. (speaks in Russian)

649
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:52,770
You know, three minutes, nothing.

650
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:53,603
Please.

651
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:04,560
Thanks.

652
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:05,670
Thanks a million.

653
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:06,503
Thank you.

654
00:24:07,358 --> 00:24:09,774
- [Nurse] Dr. Melve to
respiratory therapy.

655
00:24:09,774 --> 00:24:12,524
Dr. Melve to respiratory therapy.

656
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:18,279
- Your daughter, she's,
she's very beautiful.

657
00:24:18,279 --> 00:24:21,723
I mean, don't get me wrong,
I look, I don't touch.

658
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:25,653
Married 14 years never once.

659
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:28,470
- Not once?

660
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:30,300
- No, no, regrettably no.

661
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:31,133
You?

662
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:34,883
- I'm human.

663
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:38,010
- Wife know how human you are?

664
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,493
So this is why I came to see you.

665
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:51,360
I'm an investigator with state tax.

666
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,740
Here let me do that.

667
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:55,140
And well, frankly, I'm not interested

668
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:56,890
in the guys that tried to kill you.

669
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:01,953
More interested in the
fellas than put 'em up to it.

670
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:06,840
Um, I thought maybe he'd be
interested in a little payback

671
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,973
without having going on record of course.

672
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:12,420
Now what we got so far is a partnership

673
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:14,520
between the major American corporation

674
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,470
and a Russian criminal who's
trying to lay his hands

675
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:18,363
on as many gas stations as he can.

676
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:25,413
- I don't understand what you want.

677
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:29,070
- Well, the American oil
company, we can't really touch.

678
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:33,810
But the Russian guy, this
guy, he's a fair game.

679
00:25:33,810 --> 00:25:36,123
- [Andre] But what do you want from me?

680
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,410
- We want you to point us
in the right direction.

681
00:25:42,571 --> 00:25:45,227
You think about it, you
know, I'll be in touch.

682
00:25:45,227 --> 00:25:48,060
(group screaming)

683
00:25:49,170 --> 00:25:50,783
You want me to get rid of that for you?

684
00:25:54,284 --> 00:25:56,784
(man yelling)

685
00:26:04,954 --> 00:26:07,287
- What is the window doing open?

686
00:26:07,287 --> 00:26:10,186
(door bangs)

687
00:26:10,186 --> 00:26:11,631
- Take care.

688
00:26:11,631 --> 00:26:12,477
(window bangs)

689
00:26:12,477 --> 00:26:14,284
(door clicks)

690
00:26:14,284 --> 00:26:15,746
(Joseph speaks in Russian)

691
00:26:15,746 --> 00:26:17,958
(gentle brooding music)

692
00:26:17,958 --> 00:26:19,708
- [Joseph] Thank you.

693
00:26:24,379 --> 00:26:26,796
(door bangs)

694
00:26:28,087 --> 00:26:29,397
(Andre groaning)

695
00:26:29,397 --> 00:26:33,257
(Nadia speaking in Russian)

696
00:26:33,257 --> 00:26:36,424
(speaking in Russian)

697
00:26:40,497 --> 00:26:44,409
(speaking in Russian)

698
00:26:44,409 --> 00:26:48,076
(Andre speaking in Russian)

699
00:26:52,748 --> 00:26:57,382
(Nadia speaking in foreign language)

700
00:26:57,382 --> 00:27:00,919
(thunder rumbling)
(rain pattering)

701
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:02,802
(bell ringing)

702
00:27:02,802 --> 00:27:05,552
(brooding music)

703
00:27:07,078 --> 00:27:09,210
(thunder rumbling)

704
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:11,610
- [Al] Brighton Beach is
a very small community,

705
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:15,840
and I figured Andre had to know
who this Misha Baruchin was.

706
00:27:18,922 --> 00:27:22,513
All I had to do was figure out
a way to get Andre to talk.

707
00:27:42,733 --> 00:27:46,303
(camera snaps)
(car door clicks)

708
00:27:46,303 --> 00:27:47,580
I was surprised to see Nadia

709
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:49,330
pull into her father's gas station.

710
00:27:51,930 --> 00:27:55,923
I admired her courage,
her loyalty to her father.

711
00:27:57,420 --> 00:28:00,720
But I also remembered Topolev
trying to extort Andre

712
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,860
and I thought she was putting
herself in great danger.

713
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:07,413
So I decided to stay close
to her for a few days.

714
00:28:09,443 --> 00:28:13,225
(seagulls squawking)
(dog barking)

715
00:28:13,225 --> 00:28:15,808
(gentle music)

716
00:28:20,195 --> 00:28:22,778
(camera snaps)

717
00:28:24,694 --> 00:28:27,277
(camera snaps)

718
00:28:29,595 --> 00:28:32,178
(camera snaps)

719
00:28:33,483 --> 00:28:36,316
(traffic humming)

720
00:28:37,901 --> 00:28:39,783
(camera snaps)

721
00:28:39,783 --> 00:28:43,211
(man speaking in Russian)

722
00:28:43,211 --> 00:28:48,211
(gentle brooding music)
(camera snaps)

723
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:51,938
(doorbell rings)

724
00:28:51,938 --> 00:28:52,771
- Who is it?

725
00:28:52,771 --> 00:28:53,630
- [Al] Al Benjamin.

726
00:28:55,799 --> 00:28:57,990
(locks clicking)

727
00:28:57,990 --> 00:28:59,337
How you doing?

728
00:28:59,337 --> 00:29:00,180
(lock clicks)

729
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:01,117
- [Nadia] Good.

730
00:29:01,117 --> 00:29:01,950
Come in.

731
00:29:03,377 --> 00:29:04,849
- How's your dad?

732
00:29:04,849 --> 00:29:07,110
- He's better, but not good yet.

733
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:09,622
- Well, he's a, he's a tough guy.

734
00:29:09,622 --> 00:29:10,933
He's gonna be okay.

735
00:29:10,933 --> 00:29:11,766
I got these.

736
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:17,333
- Thank you.

737
00:29:17,333 --> 00:29:19,773
- I thought they, I thought
they might cheer him up.

738
00:29:22,289 --> 00:29:23,122
(woman speaking in Russian)

739
00:29:23,122 --> 00:29:25,350
So this is a nice place you have here.

740
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:26,522
- Thank you.

741
00:29:26,522 --> 00:29:29,360
- You know, you speak very good
English. You mind my asking,

742
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,743
do you go to school or you go to college?

743
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:36,450
- I did one year, but it wasn't for me.

744
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:38,220
- [Natalia] Nadia. (speaks in Russian)

745
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:39,384
- [Al] Hi.

746
00:29:39,384 --> 00:29:40,653
- Hey. (chuckles)

747
00:29:40,653 --> 00:29:42,810
This is my sister, Natalia.

748
00:29:42,810 --> 00:29:44,640
- Oh, Natalia.

749
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:49,590
Nadia, Natalia, very, very pretty names.

750
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:51,390
We should all stay this way forever.

751
00:29:52,927 --> 00:29:55,110
(Nadia speaks in Russian)

752
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:56,160
Andre, how you doing?

753
00:29:57,450 --> 00:29:58,987
No, no, no, please don't get up.

754
00:29:58,987 --> 00:30:00,780
- It's okay.

755
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:02,040
I want to be able to stand

756
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:04,590
when I give my daughter away.

757
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:06,943
Plus it's very bad luck
to postpone a wedding.

758
00:30:06,943 --> 00:30:10,260
- Yeah, it's also bad luck
that your stitches burst.

759
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:11,850
- You should come to the wedding, please.

760
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:13,170
- No, no, no, I'd be outta place.

761
00:30:13,170 --> 00:30:15,990
- No, now that I have
invited you to the wedding,

762
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:18,933
it would be very bad
luck if you did not come.

763
00:30:20,495 --> 00:30:22,290
- Why?

764
00:30:22,290 --> 00:30:24,603
- Russians invite everyone to wedding.

765
00:30:26,010 --> 00:30:28,713
Super, you know, fate.

766
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:31,923
Not exactly fate.

767
00:30:33,097 --> 00:30:34,590
(speaking in Russian)

768
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:35,580
- Superstition.

769
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:36,894
- Oh yeah, okay.

770
00:30:36,894 --> 00:30:38,725
(Nadia speaking in Russian)

771
00:30:38,725 --> 00:30:40,642
We got you, we got you.

772
00:30:41,496 --> 00:30:43,080
- Please, I do not mean to be too rude,

773
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:45,443
but you cannot stay too long.
- No, no, I won't, I won't.

774
00:30:45,443 --> 00:30:46,276
- Nadia.

775
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:55,680
So my accountant tells me that somebody

776
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:59,395
from state tax wants to audit my returns.

777
00:30:59,395 --> 00:31:00,228
(Al chuckles)

778
00:31:00,228 --> 00:31:01,061
Is this you?

779
00:31:01,061 --> 00:31:02,220
- Yeah, it's me.

780
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:03,773
I ran you through the computer, Andre.

781
00:31:03,773 --> 00:31:05,700
You got a few problems.

782
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:07,440
You've never filed on
your corporate taxes.

783
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,003
You've never paid sales tax.

784
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:11,700
- Big deal.

785
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,530
State tax is one year maximum.

786
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:15,150
I do this standing on my head.

787
00:31:15,150 --> 00:31:17,490
- Okay, but there's also
a federal tax on gasoline,

788
00:31:17,490 --> 00:31:18,930
and you haven't filed on that either.

789
00:31:18,930 --> 00:31:20,610
And guess what the
conspiracy count on that is?

790
00:31:20,610 --> 00:31:21,443
It's eight years.

791
00:31:21,443 --> 00:31:23,156
Your head's gonna be awfully sore.

792
00:31:23,156 --> 00:31:24,360
(man singing in Russian)

793
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:25,622
You ever hear a quid pro quo?

794
00:31:25,622 --> 00:31:26,790
(man singing in Russian)

795
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:28,350
You scratch my back, I scratch yours.

796
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:29,350
Everybody scratches.

797
00:31:31,117 --> 00:31:33,343
(man singing in Russian)

798
00:31:33,343 --> 00:31:35,430
(Andre chuckling)

799
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:37,803
- You do your job very well, tax man.

800
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:41,523
But this is not a very good time.

801
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,105
We must wait for the wedding first.

802
00:31:44,105 --> 00:31:45,903
This is most important to me.

803
00:31:47,190 --> 00:31:52,190
Then later, like you said,
you do me a little favor,

804
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,683
I do you a little favor.

805
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:00,091
(Andre speaking in Russian)

806
00:32:00,091 --> 00:32:01,665
(Nadia laughs)

807
00:32:01,665 --> 00:32:05,165
(man speaking in Russian)

808
00:32:07,216 --> 00:32:10,883
(Andre speaking in Russian)

809
00:32:11,859 --> 00:32:13,078
(camera snaps)

810
00:32:13,078 --> 00:32:16,268
(Nadia speaking in Russian)

811
00:32:16,268 --> 00:32:20,748
(Andre speaking in Russian)

812
00:32:20,748 --> 00:32:24,415
(Nadia speaking in Russian)

813
00:32:27,818 --> 00:32:29,744
(camera snaps)

814
00:32:29,744 --> 00:32:31,890
- [Joseph] Ah, we shouldn't be here.

815
00:32:31,890 --> 00:32:33,090
This isn't right, Al.

816
00:32:33,090 --> 00:32:34,756
- [Al] Why?
- [Joseph] Because I can get

817
00:32:34,756 --> 00:32:36,030
in big trouble for doing this.

818
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:38,040
- [Al] What, for going to a wedding?

819
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:38,910
- I shouldn't have listened to you.

820
00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:40,080
Socializing with these people

821
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,640
is totally crossing the line, Al.

822
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,060
- Look Mr. Joseph, please.

823
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:45,780
We're going to a wedding
for crying out loud.

824
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:49,110
We're gonna meet big Russian
women with humongous vavooms.

825
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:51,360
- I don't want a big Russian
woman with big vavooms.

826
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,860
I want a nice Catholic girl.

827
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:54,720
- Yeah, well, same difference.

828
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,953
Give me 20 bucks.

829
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:59,370
You're carrying a gun.

830
00:32:59,370 --> 00:33:00,600
- [Joseph] These people are dangerous, Al.

831
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,550
You're gonna go in there without a gun.

832
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:04,140
- Yes.

833
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:05,190
- Go, go get your gun, Al.

834
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:06,270
- No.

835
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:07,110
- I'm serious.

836
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:08,910
I'm not going in there
unless you get your gun.

837
00:33:08,910 --> 00:33:10,687
This is Brighton Beach for Christ's sake.

838
00:33:10,687 --> 00:33:11,926
(glass shatters)

839
00:33:11,926 --> 00:33:16,926
- [Guest] Mazel tov!

840
00:33:19,486 --> 00:33:21,696
(group singing in foreign language)

841
00:33:21,696 --> 00:33:23,179
(fast tempo upbeat music)

842
00:33:23,179 --> 00:33:26,096
(group chattering)

843
00:33:32,365 --> 00:33:35,046
(Andrea speaking in Russian)

844
00:33:35,046 --> 00:33:38,613
(Nadia speaking in Russian)

845
00:33:38,613 --> 00:33:40,641
(Andre speaking in Russian)

846
00:33:40,641 --> 00:33:42,641
(Nadia speaking in Russian)

847
00:33:42,641 --> 00:33:43,891
- Hey, tax man!

848
00:33:45,193 --> 00:33:48,720
At my daughter with you
must not drink beer.

849
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,760
You must drink champagne.

850
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:51,660
I insist.

851
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:53,490
And you, you must dance.

852
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:54,472
- Oh, no, no, thank you.

853
00:33:54,472 --> 00:33:55,312
- Marsha.

854
00:33:55,312 --> 00:33:56,145
Marsha!

855
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,300
- This isn't part of the investigation.

856
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:01,970
I'm not gonna go dancing.
- Take her for a spin.

857
00:34:01,970 --> 00:34:03,000
Go dancing.
- I don't wanna

858
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:03,833
take her for a spin.
- Take her, take her.

859
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:05,936
- Go, go enjoy yourself.

860
00:34:05,936 --> 00:34:06,769
- [Joseph] Al.

861
00:34:06,769 --> 00:34:10,186
(man singing in Russian)

862
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:13,783
- Now what about you, tax man?
- No, I, I don't dance.

863
00:34:13,783 --> 00:34:15,521
I never learned how.

864
00:34:15,521 --> 00:34:16,830
- You know how to fuck?

865
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:18,030
- No, I'm a married guy.

866
00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:20,700
- Dancing is like fucking.

867
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:22,221
Your hips moving with the partner.

868
00:34:22,221 --> 00:34:23,280
See, it's natural.

869
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,863
- I can't, I can't.

870
00:34:29,276 --> 00:34:32,693
(man singing in Russian)

871
00:34:39,882 --> 00:34:43,382
(fast tempo upbeat music)

872
00:34:45,923 --> 00:34:46,966
Hello.

873
00:34:46,966 --> 00:34:48,946
- Hello.

874
00:34:48,946 --> 00:34:49,996
- You look beautiful.

875
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:53,100
- You are not enjoying yourself.

876
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:55,080
- No, I am, I am, I am.

877
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,190
- You don't dance?

878
00:34:56,190 --> 00:34:57,023
- No.

879
00:34:57,023 --> 00:34:57,856
- You should try.

880
00:35:00,683 --> 00:35:03,848
(man singing in Russian)

881
00:35:03,848 --> 00:35:06,431
(camera snaps)

882
00:35:07,328 --> 00:35:09,690
Now just follow me and do everything I do.

883
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:10,523
- Okay.

884
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:13,398
- [Nadia] Back, side, together.

885
00:35:13,398 --> 00:35:16,021
- Yeah.
- Front, side, pause.

886
00:35:16,021 --> 00:35:17,100
Back, side, pause.

887
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:17,970
- Pause.

888
00:35:17,970 --> 00:35:19,413
- Front, ow, ow!

889
00:35:19,413 --> 00:35:21,030
- Sorry, sorry, sorry.

890
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:22,020
I told you I'm a klutz.

891
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:24,563
- What that six balls and fucks you?

892
00:35:25,686 --> 00:35:26,743
- What?
- Lotto.

893
00:35:26,743 --> 00:35:31,170
- My father is like a big
bear, always makes me laugh.

894
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:32,607
Helps everybody.

895
00:35:33,898 --> 00:35:34,981
Have a drink.

896
00:35:37,669 --> 00:35:39,579
(man singing in Russian)

897
00:35:39,579 --> 00:35:42,329
(group clapping)

898
00:35:43,219 --> 00:35:46,636
(man singing in Russian)

899
00:35:53,259 --> 00:35:56,676
(man singing in Russian)

900
00:36:01,832 --> 00:36:04,882
(camera snapping)

901
00:36:04,882 --> 00:36:08,639
- [Guest] Come on, come on, come on.

902
00:36:08,639 --> 00:36:10,056
Come on, come on.

903
00:36:11,285 --> 00:36:14,702
(man singing in Russian)

904
00:37:10,058 --> 00:37:13,475
(man singing in Russian)

905
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:17,047
(Andre laughing)

906
00:37:17,047 --> 00:37:20,464
(man singing in Russian)

907
00:37:24,737 --> 00:37:28,154
(man singing in Russian)

908
00:37:33,194 --> 00:37:34,027
(hands clapping)

909
00:37:34,027 --> 00:37:37,444
(man singing in Russian)

910
00:37:39,232 --> 00:37:42,649
(man singing in Russian)

911
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:48,017
(man singing in Russian)

912
00:37:51,521 --> 00:37:54,938
(man singing in Russian)

913
00:38:01,321 --> 00:38:04,071
(group clapping)

914
00:38:09,136 --> 00:38:11,636
- Thank you, nice meeting you.

915
00:38:12,779 --> 00:38:14,326
(guest and Andre speaking in Russian)

916
00:38:14,326 --> 00:38:15,359
(guest speaking in Russian)

917
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:17,548
(Andre speaking in Russian)

918
00:38:17,548 --> 00:38:18,927
(guest 2 speaking in Russian)

919
00:38:18,927 --> 00:38:21,720
- Ah, tax man, you have good time?

920
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:22,920
- Yeah.

921
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:26,280
- Oh, I have something for you.

922
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,873
This is for your wife.

923
00:38:28,830 --> 00:38:30,593
- So when are we gonna get together?

924
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:33,150
- Whenever.

925
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:36,352
Whenever you like, you know where I am.

926
00:38:36,352 --> 00:38:37,393
- All right.

927
00:38:37,393 --> 00:38:39,003
I'll bring the bagels.

928
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,123
- Thanks, Mr. Rubakov.

929
00:38:44,813 --> 00:38:45,655
(woman speaking in Russian)

930
00:38:45,655 --> 00:38:48,405
(brooding music)

931
00:38:50,255 --> 00:38:53,088
(traffic humming)

932
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:02,260
This guy, Andre, he's a nice guy, huh?

933
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:04,493
- Yeah, he is.

934
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,450
That was a great wedding.

935
00:39:06,450 --> 00:39:07,283
- Yeah.

936
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:10,020
- Nice family.
- Uh-huh.

937
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:11,070
- [Joseph] Got a nice daughter.

938
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:12,420
- Beautiful daughters.

939
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:16,410
- You know, if we put this guy
in a public trial, you know,

940
00:39:16,410 --> 00:39:17,970
we can get him, we can get him killed.

941
00:39:17,970 --> 00:39:18,887
- Hey, hey!

942
00:39:20,494 --> 00:39:21,652
(car horn honking)

943
00:39:21,652 --> 00:39:22,902
- Sorry, sorry.

944
00:39:24,953 --> 00:39:26,790
- God, if these guys wanted him dead,

945
00:39:26,790 --> 00:39:28,540
they'd stick him in a car with you.

946
00:39:32,310 --> 00:39:35,820
- Just you know, if if if
these guys, they could, they,

947
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:37,500
they could wipe out his
whole family, you know?

948
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:38,610
- Wait.
- And, and,

949
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:39,704
and make an example of him.

950
00:39:39,704 --> 00:39:41,454
- Hey, wait a minute.

951
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:45,720
Did I tell him to cheat on his taxes, huh?

952
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:47,420
Did I tell this guy to be a crook?

953
00:39:48,330 --> 00:39:50,036
- No, still the guy's got a nice family.

954
00:39:50,036 --> 00:39:51,028
- I know that.

955
00:39:51,028 --> 00:39:52,761
Goddammit, don't you think I know that?

956
00:39:52,761 --> 00:39:54,161
Don't you think I admire it?

957
00:39:57,690 --> 00:39:59,783
I don't know what's gonna happen to Andre.

958
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,140
What I do know is you and
me, we started this thing

959
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:08,880
and now it's too late.

960
00:40:12,561 --> 00:40:13,644
I can't stop.

961
00:40:18,945 --> 00:40:20,028
I can't stop.

962
00:40:22,715 --> 00:40:24,117
(bells ringing)

963
00:40:24,117 --> 00:40:26,867
(birds chirping)

964
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,750
Do you know Misha Baruchin?

965
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:31,260
Do you know anybody that
might know Misha Baruchin?

966
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:33,085
- Sorry, but I do not know this-

967
00:40:33,085 --> 00:40:33,918
- You're a fucking liar.
- Misha Baruchin.

968
00:40:33,918 --> 00:40:34,751
- You're a fucking liar.

969
00:40:34,751 --> 00:40:35,760
I don't believe a word you're saying.

970
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:36,990
- Would you give him a chance?

971
00:40:36,990 --> 00:40:38,360
- You tell me how to find this guy

972
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:40,470
or I swear to God, I'll
throw you in fucking jail.

973
00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:41,310
You're never gonna get out.

974
00:40:41,310 --> 00:40:44,940
- Andre, it's not worth
spending eight years in jail.

975
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:46,830
- [Al] Eight years away
from your family, Andre.

976
00:40:46,830 --> 00:40:47,663
Eight.

977
00:40:47,663 --> 00:40:52,230
- You just, just, just tell
us what we need to hear

978
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:53,063
and we'll be outta here.

979
00:40:53,063 --> 00:40:54,060
- You have to believe me.

980
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:54,893
I do not know him.

981
00:40:54,893 --> 00:40:56,400
- Fuck this, fuck this,
I'm getting a warrant.

982
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:59,430
I can't believe this
motherfucker is jerking us off.

983
00:40:59,430 --> 00:41:00,667
Let's go.

984
00:41:00,667 --> 00:41:01,770
- You gotta tell us something here.

985
00:41:01,770 --> 00:41:03,330
- I swear to you on my daughter's life,

986
00:41:03,330 --> 00:41:05,820
I do not know this Misha Baruchin.

987
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:07,200
- [Al] See how you like jail, Andre.

988
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,750
- But I will tell you
something about these people.

989
00:41:19,650 --> 00:41:22,828
There's a big man who, who
puts a deal with Geofuel

990
00:41:22,828 --> 00:41:23,777
is a kapusta.

991
00:41:23,777 --> 00:41:26,040
- Kapusta, you mean like cabbage?

992
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:27,270
- Duh, like, like cabbage.

993
00:41:27,270 --> 00:41:29,070
- Oh, great you're gonna
sell fucking vegetables now.

994
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:31,230
- No, no, no, no, no,
no. Cabbage like money.

995
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:32,063
- Green money.

996
00:41:32,063 --> 00:41:34,350
It's, it's so, this kapusta.

997
00:41:34,350 --> 00:41:37,713
- He came here with many
international connections.

998
00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:40,590
Some say that he was KGB.

999
00:41:40,590 --> 00:41:41,423
Who knows?

1000
00:41:41,423 --> 00:41:44,880
- So is it, is it possible
that this, this cabbage,

1001
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:48,660
this kapusta is Misha Baruchin?

1002
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:50,620
- I do not know this Misha Baruchin.

1003
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:52,107
What, where do you get this name from?

1004
00:41:52,107 --> 00:41:53,220
- The corporate papers.

1005
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:55,923
He's an officer, president
of El Dorado Petroleum.

1006
00:41:57,770 --> 00:42:00,520
(Andre laughing)

1007
00:42:03,773 --> 00:42:07,140
What the fuck is he laughing about?

1008
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:09,128
- Andre, there's nothing funny here.

1009
00:42:09,128 --> 00:42:11,250
(Andre laughing)

1010
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:14,636
- The man on the papers is a gornisht.

1011
00:42:14,636 --> 00:42:16,327
(Andre laughing)

1012
00:42:16,327 --> 00:42:17,310
- Gornisht?

1013
00:42:17,310 --> 00:42:18,143
- Nothing it means.

1014
00:42:18,143 --> 00:42:18,976
It's Yiddish.

1015
00:42:18,976 --> 00:42:20,670
- Yes, nothing, a zero.

1016
00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:21,933
The lowest guy.

1017
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:25,410
He exists as a. (speaks in Russian)

1018
00:42:25,410 --> 00:42:27,153
You know, like a fake beard.

1019
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:31,920
He, he's someone they can put
on the plane back to Russia

1020
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:34,110
if the authorities get too close.

1021
00:42:34,110 --> 00:42:36,390
This way, they can never
make the connection

1022
00:42:36,390 --> 00:42:38,373
between this man and the kapusta.

1023
00:42:48,330 --> 00:42:49,773
- Misha Baruchin is a nobody.

1024
00:42:49,773 --> 00:42:51,690
He's a buffer.

1025
00:42:51,690 --> 00:42:53,100
But who's the kapusta?

1026
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:54,153
What's his name?

1027
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:59,260
Is it possible that Grisha
Gold was the kapusta?

1028
00:43:00,951 --> 00:43:03,900
- No, the kapusta would never be

1029
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:05,853
so close to the operation.

1030
00:43:06,690 --> 00:43:09,420
Gold ran Mars was the kapusta.

1031
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:12,330
Then Gold wanted to
start his own operation.

1032
00:43:12,330 --> 00:43:14,550
This was a big mistake.

1033
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:17,283
- So the kapusta sets
up Gold to be killed.

1034
00:43:22,590 --> 00:43:25,740
- I believe the kapusta
brought two killers

1035
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:27,573
from the Republic of Chechnya.

1036
00:43:27,573 --> 00:43:28,406
(brooding music)

1037
00:43:28,406 --> 00:43:30,570
These are people who are
exposed to poison gas

1038
00:43:30,570 --> 00:43:32,596
during the uprising. They
know they're going to die

1039
00:43:32,596 --> 00:43:34,683
so they don't give a shit about anything.

1040
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:36,900
They have no fear.

1041
00:43:38,250 --> 00:43:40,200
- Are they the same guys who shoot you?

1042
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:43,133
- Maybe.

1043
00:43:44,850 --> 00:43:46,160
What's the difference?

1044
00:43:48,803 --> 00:43:49,636
- So now we're looking-

1045
00:43:49,636 --> 00:43:52,020
- [Al] What Andre gave us was big,

1046
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:54,390
bigger than anything that
I could ever imagine.

1047
00:43:54,390 --> 00:43:55,980
We needed help.

1048
00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:58,320
What we needed was a prosecutor.

1049
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:00,840
Since state prosecutors were
indifferent to this case,

1050
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:02,880
we thought we shop it
around in federal court.

1051
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:04,830
Well, we found it wasn't an easy sell.

1052
00:44:04,830 --> 00:44:06,780
If you're a US attorney,
you're not gonna make

1053
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:09,210
any major career moves
prosecuting Russians.

1054
00:44:09,210 --> 00:44:10,740
Their ticket to fame and glory

1055
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:14,280
are the big romantic godfather
type organized crime cases.

1056
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:16,920
Five different prosecutors
told us to take a hike.

1057
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:18,840
Finally, Romero said he heard of this guy

1058
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:19,950
called Peyton Cody.

1059
00:44:19,950 --> 00:44:21,933
He was prosecuting a case in Brooklyn.

1060
00:44:22,950 --> 00:44:24,090
- All right, I gotta go
to little boy's room.

1061
00:44:24,090 --> 00:44:24,923
I'll see in a minute.

1062
00:44:24,923 --> 00:44:25,756
I'll be in there.

1063
00:44:25,756 --> 00:44:26,589
- Mr. Cody, listen.
- Hi.

1064
00:44:26,589 --> 00:44:28,350
Al Benjamin, state tax department.

1065
00:44:28,350 --> 00:44:31,230
I'd like to talk about a case
I'm putting together, okay?

1066
00:44:31,230 --> 00:44:32,160
- Guys, I don't have time.

1067
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:33,196
- And they told me to find you here.

1068
00:44:33,196 --> 00:44:34,029
- It's very important.

1069
00:44:34,029 --> 00:44:35,400
- Sir, this involves hundreds
of millions of dollars.

1070
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:37,260
Taxpayer's money could be
used in good public use.

1071
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:38,093
- Guys, I really don't have time.

1072
00:44:38,093 --> 00:44:40,260
- Russian hoods and, and
corporate assholes started it.

1073
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:41,552
- Huge corporate assholes.

1074
00:44:41,552 --> 00:44:43,530
- And I can get you the headlines, sir.

1075
00:44:43,530 --> 00:44:45,540
Washington Post, New York Times.

1076
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:46,800
- Guys, guys, I'd really like to help

1077
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:48,510
but I don't have the time.
I don't have the time.

1078
00:44:48,510 --> 00:44:49,943
It's been good talking with you.

1079
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:54,079
- Let's go.

1080
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:56,007
- Wait a minute.

1081
00:44:56,007 --> 00:44:57,690
Guy's trying to go to the bathroom, man.

1082
00:44:57,690 --> 00:44:59,310
- Right, right.

1083
00:44:59,310 --> 00:45:00,930
And I have his undivided attention.

1084
00:45:00,930 --> 00:45:02,370
I'm taking full advantage.

1085
00:45:02,370 --> 00:45:03,243
Let's go.

1086
00:45:04,902 --> 00:45:06,630
- Oh, Jesus.

1087
00:45:06,630 --> 00:45:07,463
- Mr. Cody.

1088
00:45:08,635 --> 00:45:09,747
Mr. Cody.

1089
00:45:09,747 --> 00:45:12,147
Uh, Mr. Cody, look, I, I,
I know this is not the,

1090
00:45:12,147 --> 00:45:14,160
the most opportune time, sir,

1091
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,910
but I really would like to
talk to you about this case.

1092
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:20,490
- No, this is not the time.

1093
00:45:20,490 --> 00:45:23,580
Look, look, look, I, I
don't do tax evasion cases.

1094
00:45:23,580 --> 00:45:24,813
Uh, thank you.

1095
00:45:24,813 --> 00:45:28,140
- But, sir, this is not
your normal tax case, sir.

1096
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:29,940
If you don't have
anything to read in there,

1097
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:32,010
just take, take a look
at this, will you, sir?

1098
00:45:32,010 --> 00:45:33,420
It's a summary of the case

1099
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:35,760
and it was prepared by
my brilliant colleague,

1100
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:37,890
detective in training Joseph Romero.

1101
00:45:37,890 --> 00:45:40,380
And Detective Romero would be happy

1102
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:42,030
to talk you through the case, sir.

1103
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:42,863
- Are you insane?

1104
00:45:42,863 --> 00:45:45,423
- Uh, thank you, but I
don't need anything to read.

1105
00:45:47,841 --> 00:45:50,100
- But sir, let me just explain
something to you, okay?

1106
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:51,120
We nail these guys,

1107
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:53,580
we save the taxpayers
millions of dollars, sir.

1108
00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:55,870
Just, just look. I mean, I know
you gotta do your business.

1109
00:45:55,870 --> 00:45:56,910
Do your business.

1110
00:45:56,910 --> 00:45:57,743
Detective Romero and I-

1111
00:45:57,743 --> 00:45:58,920
- Mr. Cody.
- We have no problem

1112
00:45:58,920 --> 00:45:59,753
with that, sir.
- I'd just like

1113
00:45:59,753 --> 00:46:00,586
to let you know that-
- No problem at all.

1114
00:46:00,586 --> 00:46:04,500
- I think this is a complete
invasion of a guy's privacy.

1115
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:07,200
I mean, I, I I realize
this is not the right,

1116
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:08,130
the right time.

1117
00:46:08,130 --> 00:46:10,170
And maybe.
- I'm making a presentation.

1118
00:46:10,170 --> 00:46:11,460
I rehearsed it, okay?

1119
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:12,390
- Um.
- Look, all-

1120
00:46:12,390 --> 00:46:15,480
- Sir, we've established a paper trail

1121
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:17,160
that we believe is the link.

1122
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:18,710
- [Al] Right, paper trail, sir.

1123
00:46:19,832 --> 00:46:22,113
- All right, I can't, I can't take it.

1124
00:46:23,041 --> 00:46:24,030
(door creaking)

1125
00:46:24,030 --> 00:46:26,167
- Guys, this is not the time.

1126
00:46:26,167 --> 00:46:28,830
- All right, listen, look,
I understand that, sir.

1127
00:46:28,830 --> 00:46:29,910
Look, I mean, take your time.

1128
00:46:29,910 --> 00:46:30,890
You wash your hands.

1129
00:46:30,890 --> 00:46:32,295
Look, this is a very sexy case.

1130
00:46:32,295 --> 00:46:34,271
- Look guys, look guys, look
guys, I don't have time.

1131
00:46:34,271 --> 00:46:35,104
Good luck with your case.

1132
00:46:35,104 --> 00:46:35,937
Good luck.

1133
00:46:39,001 --> 00:46:39,834
(door clicks)
(ominous music)

1134
00:46:39,834 --> 00:46:42,417
(man laughing)

1135
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:46,193
- [Al] I've always believed

1136
00:46:46,193 --> 00:46:47,973
perseverance creates opportunity.

1137
00:46:49,290 --> 00:46:51,570
No matter how hopeless
the situation seemed.

1138
00:46:51,570 --> 00:46:53,550
I didn't feel desperate.

1139
00:46:53,550 --> 00:46:54,720
Well, maybe it had something to do

1140
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:57,723
with that dopey Romero
hanging in there with me.

1141
00:47:02,396 --> 00:47:05,896
(man speaking in Russian)

1142
00:47:09,594 --> 00:47:11,511
- All right.
- My treat.

1143
00:47:16,050 --> 00:47:18,000
- Hey, hey.

1144
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,743
Sleeping Beauty, come on, get up.

1145
00:47:19,743 --> 00:47:22,320
(man speaking in Russian)

1146
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:23,570
No wonder you live alone.

1147
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:43,929
(group chattering)

1148
00:47:43,929 --> 00:47:45,340
(car door bangs)

1149
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:48,423
(car doors clicking)

1150
00:47:50,957 --> 00:47:53,255
(car doors banging)

1151
00:47:53,255 --> 00:47:55,268
(camera clicking)

1152
00:47:55,268 --> 00:47:56,183
- How are you?

1153
00:47:56,183 --> 00:47:58,722
Very nice suit tonight.

1154
00:47:58,722 --> 00:48:02,592
(group chattering)
(camera clicks)

1155
00:48:02,592 --> 00:48:04,342
- Who are those guys?

1156
00:48:05,497 --> 00:48:06,330
- Don't know.

1157
00:48:06,330 --> 00:48:08,250
But let's stick around
and get their plates.

1158
00:48:08,250 --> 00:48:09,570
- [Joseph] This guy
here is one of the heads

1159
00:48:09,570 --> 00:48:10,950
of the Brooklyn Russian mafia.

1160
00:48:10,950 --> 00:48:11,910
- Guys, guys.
- This guy here.

1161
00:48:11,910 --> 00:48:13,803
- I've done my share
of cases for the year.

1162
00:48:13,803 --> 00:48:14,636
- He's the senior vice president.

1163
00:48:14,636 --> 00:48:15,469
- Vice president.

1164
00:48:15,469 --> 00:48:17,024
- Guys, I don't have time.

1165
00:48:17,024 --> 00:48:18,948
- Geofuel.
- Geofuel, sir!

1166
00:48:18,948 --> 00:48:20,031
This is huge!

1167
00:48:27,090 --> 00:48:28,200
- Geofuel.
- Right.

1168
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:30,049
That's what we've been trying to tell you.

1169
00:48:30,049 --> 00:48:32,457
- [Peyton] The Geofuel.

1170
00:48:32,457 --> 00:48:33,660
- [Al] Will you look at
the frigging picture.

1171
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:37,080
Excuse me, but Mason
Buckley, this guy Topolev.

1172
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:39,600
Topolev, a ruthless Russian gangster.

1173
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:41,065
And this guy tell about him.

1174
00:48:41,065 --> 00:48:41,898
- That's Joe Lutz.

1175
00:48:41,898 --> 00:48:43,200
He's the senior vice president of,

1176
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:44,510
of trade and supply for Geofuel.

1177
00:48:44,510 --> 00:48:47,106
- [Al] I'm telling you, sir, this is huge.

1178
00:48:47,106 --> 00:48:48,798
(bell dings)
(dramatic music)

1179
00:48:48,798 --> 00:48:50,730
(traffic humming)

1180
00:48:50,730 --> 00:48:52,770
So now we got a prosecutor.

1181
00:48:52,770 --> 00:48:54,300
That means now we can finally

1182
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:56,490
subpoena El Dorado Bank account records.

1183
00:48:56,490 --> 00:48:57,930
We can track all the phone activity

1184
00:48:57,930 --> 00:48:59,880
for Topolev's Mars office.

1185
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:02,040
Connect the kapusta with Geofuel

1186
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:04,076
we had to follow the money.

1187
00:49:04,076 --> 00:49:05,619
(Joseph whistles)

1188
00:49:05,619 --> 00:49:06,452
- [Peyton] What?

1189
00:49:06,452 --> 00:49:08,853
- Wow, look at the dollars.

1190
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:11,910
Every single day, we have almost

1191
00:49:11,910 --> 00:49:14,190
a million dollars in transactions.

1192
00:49:14,190 --> 00:49:15,963
Money going in, money going out.

1193
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:19,410
I mean, we're talking
one day, one account,

1194
00:49:19,410 --> 00:49:21,390
but at the end of every day,

1195
00:49:21,390 --> 00:49:23,670
the balance is never more than $50.

1196
00:49:23,670 --> 00:49:26,835
- Money's coming in from
Mars gas stations, right?

1197
00:49:26,835 --> 00:49:27,668
- Right.

1198
00:49:27,668 --> 00:49:28,501
- [Peyton] But where's it going to?

1199
00:49:28,501 --> 00:49:29,733
- Uh, I know that.

1200
00:49:32,550 --> 00:49:37,550
About half's going to PO Box
1213 Central Post Office,

1201
00:49:37,740 --> 00:49:39,780
Eighth Avenue, New York City.

1202
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:42,600
That could be a kapusta connection.

1203
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:45,333
Um, the other half.

1204
00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:48,090
Wait a minute.
- What?

1205
00:49:48,090 --> 00:49:50,340
- Wow, guess where the
other half's going to.

1206
00:49:51,218 --> 00:49:52,200
- [Peyton and Joseph] Geofuel.

1207
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:53,033
- That's right.

1208
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:55,418
What'd I tell you?

1209
00:49:55,418 --> 00:49:56,672
- This is great.
- What'd I tell you?

1210
00:49:56,672 --> 00:49:57,930
(upbeat music)
(group chattering)

1211
00:49:57,930 --> 00:49:59,762
- Uh, Mr. Benjamin.
- Mr. Benjamin.

1212
00:49:59,762 --> 00:50:02,310
- Yes, sir.
- Mr. Benjamin, over here.

1213
00:50:02,310 --> 00:50:04,117
- [Peyton] Okay, gentlemen,
time for the good guys

1214
00:50:04,117 --> 00:50:05,070
to make their play.

1215
00:50:05,070 --> 00:50:06,870
- [Al] Let's go Mets.

1216
00:50:06,870 --> 00:50:08,790
So Cody decides we should go

1217
00:50:08,790 --> 00:50:10,890
at both flanks of the conspiracy,

1218
00:50:10,890 --> 00:50:12,640
the kapusta and Geofuel.

1219
00:50:14,310 --> 00:50:17,940
We knew that the PO box was
the way to find the kapusta.

1220
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:19,963
Two days after we
started our surveillance,

1221
00:50:19,963 --> 00:50:22,650
a single envelope was placed in that box.

1222
00:50:22,650 --> 00:50:25,500
We assume with checks
from Mars gas stations.

1223
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:28,110
We waited for someone
to pick up the envelope.

1224
00:50:28,110 --> 00:50:31,743
For two weeks we waited and
waited, but no one showed.

1225
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:34,890
Meanwhile, Cody put together a task force

1226
00:50:34,890 --> 00:50:36,930
and made a move on Geofuel.

1227
00:50:36,930 --> 00:50:38,310
He asked to see the two executives

1228
00:50:38,310 --> 00:50:40,110
who sign the original deal with Misha.

1229
00:50:40,110 --> 00:50:41,790
- Gentleman, thank you for coming.

1230
00:50:41,790 --> 00:50:42,990
On this sales agreement

1231
00:50:42,990 --> 00:50:45,870
between Geofuel and El Dorado Petroleum,

1232
00:50:45,870 --> 00:50:49,377
whose president is Misha Baruchin.

1233
00:50:49,377 --> 00:50:53,104
- Uh, Baruchin is the way
it's pronounced with huh.

1234
00:50:53,104 --> 00:50:54,520
- Baruchin.

1235
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:56,280
Okay, I see his signature.

1236
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:58,593
I see Mr. Buckley's signature.

1237
00:50:59,651 --> 00:51:01,590
Huh?

1238
00:51:01,590 --> 00:51:02,940
I see Mr. Lutz's signature.

1239
00:51:05,220 --> 00:51:06,053
Thank you.

1240
00:51:06,053 --> 00:51:09,360
Uh, I thought you gentlemen

1241
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:12,633
might be able to describe
this Misha for us.

1242
00:51:16,020 --> 00:51:17,583
If your lawyer doesn't mind.

1243
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:22,673
- Of course not.

1244
00:51:22,673 --> 00:51:23,506
Absolutely.

1245
00:51:23,506 --> 00:51:26,100
We're, we're anxious to help
the government any way we can.

1246
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:27,270
- Good, good.
- You know,

1247
00:51:27,270 --> 00:51:30,360
I don't really understand
exactly what you're getting at

1248
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:33,900
with these questions or what
possible nefarious involvement

1249
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:34,830
you are hinting at.

1250
00:51:34,830 --> 00:51:37,080
But as my clients have nothing to hide,

1251
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:42,080
they're very comfortable
indulging this whim.

1252
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:45,540
- This is a whim.

1253
00:51:45,540 --> 00:51:46,950
Yeah, no.
- Mr. Kravitz,

1254
00:51:46,950 --> 00:51:50,040
I assure you that this is not a whim,

1255
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:53,673
but your client's cooperation
will be appreciated and noted.

1256
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:57,963
Can you describe Misha, please?

1257
00:51:58,847 --> 00:52:01,380
- Of course, he was middle aged.

1258
00:52:01,380 --> 00:52:03,900
Very distinguished, very impressive.

1259
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:05,077
- [Joe] Very well dressed.

1260
00:52:05,077 --> 00:52:06,690
- [Mason] Came in a beautiful suit.

1261
00:52:06,690 --> 00:52:08,490
Remember the beautiful suit?

1262
00:52:08,490 --> 00:52:09,750
- Drove a beautiful car.

1263
00:52:09,750 --> 00:52:10,710
A Rolls Royce.

1264
00:52:10,710 --> 00:52:12,780
- Very well presented,
very well presented.

1265
00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:13,740
- Wealthy.

1266
00:52:13,740 --> 00:52:14,910
- There was really no reason to believe

1267
00:52:14,910 --> 00:52:17,010
he was anything other
than what he purported to.

1268
00:52:17,010 --> 00:52:18,147
- The president of a company

1269
00:52:18,147 --> 00:52:19,920
who owned a lot of gas lane stations.

1270
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:22,799
- All through the, through
the metropolitan area.

1271
00:52:22,799 --> 00:52:25,380
He was, he was charming
and, and well spoken.

1272
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:27,660
He was the, he was the very image

1273
00:52:27,660 --> 00:52:31,080
of a high powered fuel industry executive.

1274
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:32,220
- Are you sure?

1275
00:52:32,220 --> 00:52:33,120
- Of course.

1276
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:36,840
- Mr. Cody, obviously my client are sure.

1277
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:39,540
So if there are no further
questions, why don't we-

1278
00:52:39,540 --> 00:52:41,310
- I have a question.
- Wrap this up.

1279
00:52:41,310 --> 00:52:43,710
- Well, it's a statement really.

1280
00:52:43,710 --> 00:52:48,390
Mr. Kravitz, I think it would be

1281
00:52:48,390 --> 00:52:50,039
in your client's best interest-

1282
00:52:50,039 --> 00:52:50,872
- Al.

1283
00:52:50,872 --> 00:52:55,290
- If you explained to this lying rat fuck

1284
00:52:55,290 --> 00:52:56,363
that perjuring himself.

1285
00:52:56,363 --> 00:52:58,341
- Al, Al, Al.

1286
00:52:58,341 --> 00:52:59,549
- The state-
- Gentlemen.

1287
00:52:59,549 --> 00:53:01,233
- The federal law.
- Thank you for coming in.

1288
00:53:01,233 --> 00:53:02,618
- Like five years in prison, okay?

1289
00:53:02,618 --> 00:53:04,315
- Al, Al, Al.
- Five.

1290
00:53:04,315 --> 00:53:05,896
Five, you wanna do five years?

1291
00:53:05,896 --> 00:53:07,490
This is your chance to
tell the fucking truth.

1292
00:53:07,490 --> 00:53:08,910
- Gentlemen, I'm sorry, the meetings over.

1293
00:53:08,910 --> 00:53:09,955
- Your chance.
- Thank you.

1294
00:53:09,955 --> 00:53:11,460
Let me show you out.
- Gasoline.

1295
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:13,020
Six people have died.

1296
00:53:13,020 --> 00:53:16,207
Six people have died
and you're responsible.

1297
00:53:16,207 --> 00:53:18,660
And I'm gonna get you and
your Brooks Brother suit.

1298
00:53:18,660 --> 00:53:20,070
So so long, pal!

1299
00:53:20,070 --> 00:53:21,470
You blew it!
- Settle down.

1300
00:53:22,317 --> 00:53:23,817
- [Al] You believe these guys?

1301
00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:27,420
- [Peyton] Al, didn't we
have a game plan here?

1302
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:29,753
- [Al] Yeah, but they were lying.

1303
00:53:29,753 --> 00:53:31,854
- Al.

1304
00:53:31,854 --> 00:53:33,180
Al.

1305
00:53:33,180 --> 00:53:34,410
What the fuck are you doing?

1306
00:53:34,410 --> 00:53:35,243
- [Al] What?

1307
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:39,060
- I wanted them to lie!

1308
00:53:39,060 --> 00:53:40,383
I wanted them to lie, Al!

1309
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:45,273
We put Misha on the witness
stand, expose the lie, we win.

1310
00:53:46,590 --> 00:53:49,110
You could have poisoned the whole case.

1311
00:53:49,110 --> 00:53:49,950
You may have.

1312
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:55,563
- I'm sorry.

1313
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:00,390
- Let's look at the big picture.

1314
00:54:00,390 --> 00:54:02,490
Nobody showed up at the PO box,

1315
00:54:02,490 --> 00:54:05,370
but we'll continue our surveillance.

1316
00:54:05,370 --> 00:54:08,013
The Geofuel papers
aren't giving back much.

1317
00:54:10,770 --> 00:54:13,630
No Misha, no kapusta.

1318
00:54:15,593 --> 00:54:16,530
We still don't have a case.

1319
00:54:16,530 --> 00:54:17,610
- Well, these phone numbers

1320
00:54:17,610 --> 00:54:19,660
keep showing up over and over again.

1321
00:54:19,660 --> 00:54:20,493
I mean-
- The Geofuel lawyers

1322
00:54:20,493 --> 00:54:23,189
will concede that their gas
wound up in the wrong hands.

1323
00:54:23,189 --> 00:54:25,263
- A flower shop owned by-
- But their intention will be

1324
00:54:25,263 --> 00:54:27,240
that they were duped by Russians.

1325
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:29,730
- Tuna, tuna company owned by-

1326
00:54:29,730 --> 00:54:32,460
- No kapusta.
- One Sergei Utisov.

1327
00:54:32,460 --> 00:54:33,420
- We don't have a case.

1328
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:34,950
- But for all we know could be

1329
00:54:34,950 --> 00:54:38,370
somebody's cousin calling
for very fresh tuna.

1330
00:54:38,370 --> 00:54:39,300
- Come on, guys, think.

1331
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:40,620
- There's nowhere air in this place.

1332
00:54:40,620 --> 00:54:42,480
Can somebody open up a window please?

1333
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:43,551
- [Joseph] What are you kidding me?

1334
00:54:43,551 --> 00:54:44,384
It's freezing outside.

1335
00:54:44,384 --> 00:54:45,510
- We're not getting anywhere with this

1336
00:54:45,510 --> 00:54:47,070
'cause of all the paperwork.

1337
00:54:47,070 --> 00:54:47,940
That's how they get you.

1338
00:54:47,940 --> 00:54:50,310
They drown you in the paperwork.

1339
00:54:50,310 --> 00:54:51,143
My neck is killing me.

1340
00:54:51,143 --> 00:54:52,530
I can't turn my freaking head.

1341
00:54:54,090 --> 00:54:55,650
Somebody take a gun and shoot me, please.

1342
00:54:55,650 --> 00:54:56,483
- Al.

1343
00:54:57,510 --> 00:54:59,393
You don't shut up, I'll
take you up on that.

1344
00:55:01,620 --> 00:55:02,940
What happened to the guy that was so sure

1345
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:05,040
we were gonna win this case?

1346
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:05,873
- Right.

1347
00:55:08,130 --> 00:55:09,430
I'm gonna get some coffee.

1348
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:12,243
Can I get anybody some coffee?

1349
00:55:14,130 --> 00:55:15,810
You drop something off a tall building

1350
00:55:15,810 --> 00:55:17,250
it's gonna crash for sure,

1351
00:55:17,250 --> 00:55:19,050
but it's gonna bounce one last time

1352
00:55:19,050 --> 00:55:20,430
before the lights go out.

1353
00:55:20,430 --> 00:55:21,960
That's kind of the way I felt.

1354
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:23,343
No, no, no, no.

1355
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:28,140
We will not go gently
into that, that night.

1356
00:55:28,140 --> 00:55:29,940
Or however the fuck that thing goes.

1357
00:55:31,950 --> 00:55:35,564
- Do not go gentle into that good night.

1358
00:55:35,564 --> 00:55:36,397
- That's right.

1359
00:55:36,397 --> 00:55:39,227
- Rage, rage against
the dying of the light.

1360
00:55:39,227 --> 00:55:40,060
- Right.

1361
00:55:40,060 --> 00:55:41,190
- That's my mother's favorite poem.

1362
00:55:41,190 --> 00:55:42,717
You read poetry like that?

1363
00:55:42,717 --> 00:55:44,880
- No, I read graffiti
on the bathroom walls.

1364
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:46,797
What do you take me for a idiot?

1365
00:55:46,797 --> 00:55:49,350
Now look, I'll tell you
what we're gonna do.

1366
00:55:49,350 --> 00:55:50,183
We're gonna go to Mars

1367
00:55:50,183 --> 00:55:52,800
and we're gonna tell
this Topolev character

1368
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:55,680
in no uncertain terms that
we know there's a kapusta.

1369
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:58,710
We're even gonna hint that
maybe he's the kapusta.

1370
00:55:58,710 --> 00:55:59,870
- But we don't think he's a kapusta.

1371
00:55:59,870 --> 00:56:01,470
So why would we, why we bother?

1372
00:56:01,470 --> 00:56:02,970
- Because the prick will be so shocked

1373
00:56:02,970 --> 00:56:05,459
we even know that there is a kapusta,

1374
00:56:05,459 --> 00:56:07,680
the first phone call he
makes, once we leave,

1375
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:10,023
hopefully he'll be to
the cabbage man himself.

1376
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:14,429
Check and see if my gun's under the seat.

1377
00:56:14,429 --> 00:56:16,380
- Well, well, exactly how mad

1378
00:56:16,380 --> 00:56:17,213
are you gonna make these people, Al?

1379
00:56:17,213 --> 00:56:18,840
'Cause-
- I'll be my

1380
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:20,013
usual charming self.

1381
00:56:21,780 --> 00:56:22,923
- Now I'm really worried.

1382
00:56:22,923 --> 00:56:25,756
(traffic humming)

1383
00:56:31,723 --> 00:56:32,556
(engine backfires)

1384
00:56:32,556 --> 00:56:35,306
(brooding music)

1385
00:56:36,293 --> 00:56:37,477
(car door bangs)

1386
00:56:37,477 --> 00:56:38,727
- How ya doing?

1387
00:56:44,790 --> 00:56:45,930
Al Benjamin, state tax.

1388
00:56:45,930 --> 00:56:47,526
I wanna see your boss.

1389
00:56:47,526 --> 00:56:51,276
(Joseph speaking in Russian)

1390
00:56:52,380 --> 00:56:53,400
Yeah, right, polica.

1391
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:54,540
You know what I'm talking about.

1392
00:56:54,540 --> 00:56:56,525
Tell him I wanna see him.

1393
00:56:56,525 --> 00:56:57,834
(knuckles tapping)

1394
00:56:57,834 --> 00:57:01,501
(guard speaking in Russian)

1395
00:57:05,183 --> 00:57:06,350
How you doing?

1396
00:57:09,655 --> 00:57:11,319
What are you guys playing hearts?

1397
00:57:11,319 --> 00:57:12,930
(door buzzes)
(door clicks)

1398
00:57:12,930 --> 00:57:13,830
He needs that ace.

1399
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:21,453
- So what do you want?

1400
00:57:26,983 --> 00:57:28,983
- I wanna ask you a couple of questions.

1401
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:32,340
- I think that you are wasting your time.

1402
00:57:32,340 --> 00:57:34,593
I, I don't know nothing about nothing.

1403
00:57:36,810 --> 00:57:39,660
And gentlemen, this is a private property.

1404
00:57:39,660 --> 00:57:41,043
Do you have a warrant?

1405
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:43,410
- No.

1406
00:57:43,410 --> 00:57:45,570
But I do wanna ask you
a couple of questions

1407
00:57:45,570 --> 00:57:47,160
about a friend of yours.

1408
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:48,273
Very special friend.

1409
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:52,073
The kapusta.

1410
00:58:00,450 --> 00:58:02,373
- Why you fucking with my business?

1411
00:58:05,610 --> 00:58:06,450
What's in it for you?

1412
00:58:06,450 --> 00:58:09,120
You, you looking for something?

1413
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:11,010

Do you know the kapusta?

1417
00:58:18,420 --> 00:58:20,100

00:58:22,642 --> 00:58:26,643

You do what you're told.

You have your head so far
up this kapusta guy's ass

00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:41,943
you got shit stains on your socks.

1427
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:48,423
but you're not going to
be around for that long.

1428
00:58:51,060 --> 00:58:52,620
And who's this clown?

1429

1442
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:29,190

1444
00:59:36,030 --> 00:59:36,863

1446
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:40,207

Hey, sorry to track you down
like this, but it's important.

1470
01:00:46,890 --> 01:00:49,950
We went by your house and your
wife said you was here so.

1471
01:00:49,950 --> 01:00:51,540
- This is my private time with my family.

- [Andre] You are putting me in danger.

1477

1483

- [Al] I like you, Andre,
but I have to do this.

1484
01:01:31,710 --> 01:01:33,480
So tell me what you know and I'll leave.

1485
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:35,010
- Listen to me, tax man.

1486
01:01:35,010 --> 01:01:36,610
- Is it a front for the kapusta?

1487
01:01:39,417 --> 01:01:42,093
- You are a family man, I'm a family man.

1488
01:01:43,007 --> 01:01:45,960
This time I spent here with
my daughters is my time.

1489
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:46,793
- [Al] I respect that.

1490
01:01:46,793 --> 01:01:49,443
- I do not want my family
involved with my business.

1491
01:01:55,650 --> 01:01:57,870
- Well, then stop bullshitting
around, all right?

1492
01:01:57,870 --> 01:01:58,833
Give me a name.

1493

You wanna spend time with your family?

(Nadia speaking in Russian)

1496
01:02:19,375 --> 01:02:23,340

1497
01:02:23,340 --> 01:02:24,173
Andre,

1498
01:02:25,145 --> 01:02:27,870

1499
01:02:27,870 --> 01:02:29,730
just gimme his name.

1500
01:02:29,730 --> 01:02:32,734
- I won't talk about this right now.

1501
01:02:32,734 --> 01:02:35,403
Nadia, you remember Mr. Benjamin?

1502
01:02:36,270 --> 01:02:39,750
- [Nadia] Yes, I remember Mr.
Benjamin's as a gentleman.

1503
01:02:39,750 --> 01:02:42,330
But gentleman do not show up uninvited.

married by treating you?

1505
01:02:44,611 --> 01:02:46,796
- [Nadia] Look, this is
probably not the best place

1506
01:02:46,796 --> 01:02:47,629
for all of us to meet for small talk.

1507
01:02:47,629 --> 01:02:48,462
- [Al] Look, I don't mean to intrude,

1508
01:02:48,462 --> 01:02:49,757
it's just your father needs to
clear up a couple of things.

1509
01:02:49,757 --> 01:02:50,880

Let me tell you something,
this was a good man.

1593
01:09:22,007 --> 01:09:22,840
He was a nice man.

1594
01:09:22,840 --> 01:09:24,330
He was a family man.

1595
01:09:24,330 --> 01:09:25,650
Now I'm gonna fucking get you.

1596
01:09:25,650 --> 01:09:26,483
- Okay.

1597
01:09:26,483 --> 01:09:27,480
- You're a scumbag.
- Okay.

1598
01:09:27,480 --> 01:09:29,610
- I'm gonna fucking get you.
By the time this is over,

1599
01:09:29,610 --> 01:09:31,786
you're either gonna be dead or in jail.

1600
01:09:31,786 --> 01:09:32,700
- Okay.
- You and your kapusta.

1601
01:09:32,700 --> 01:09:33,533
- No problem.

1602
01:09:39,180 --> 01:09:41,963
- There was a lot of controversy
around Andre's killing.

1603
01:09:43,020 --> 01:09:45,240
Romero's captain was
pressing departmental charges

1604
01:09:45,240 --> 01:09:48,330
for conducting an
unauthorized investigation.

1605
01:09:48,330 --> 01:09:50,280
My own office was charging
me with everything

1606
01:09:50,280 --> 01:09:52,580
from insubordination to
reckless endangerment.

1607
01:09:54,090 --> 01:09:57,450
The reckless endangerment
part, they were right about.

1608
01:09:57,450 --> 01:09:58,440
I'll never forget the look

1609
01:09:58,440 --> 01:10:00,140
on Nadia's face as long as I live.

1610
01:10:01,260 --> 01:10:02,220
Both from Rome and me

1611
01:10:02,220 --> 01:10:05,100
were officially unwelcome
at our respective offices.

1612
01:10:05,100 --> 01:10:07,323
And we were both gonna
be fired within days.

1613
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:12,480
Though, Cody had disbanded the
task force, we still hung on.

1614
01:10:12,480 --> 01:10:13,983
We really had no place to go.

1615
01:10:15,090 --> 01:10:17,190
Look, I know you're mad at me.

1616
01:10:17,190 --> 01:10:18,023
- I'm not mad.

1617
01:10:19,470 --> 01:10:20,940
- I got you into this.

1618
01:10:20,940 --> 01:10:23,460
- You didn't get me into anything.

1619
01:10:23,460 --> 01:10:25,230
I asked you to take me along, right?

1620
01:10:25,230 --> 01:10:26,430
- So what are you sulking for?

1621
01:10:26,430 --> 01:10:29,163
- I'm not sulking. And if I
wanna sulk, I'm gonna sulk.

1622
01:10:29,163 --> 01:10:30,207
And, and it's, and it's,

1623
01:10:30,207 --> 01:10:31,953
and it's not gonna be
any of your business.

1624
01:10:31,953 --> 01:10:33,367
And, and, and I don't have to ask-

1625
01:10:33,367 --> 01:10:34,200
- So say it then.
- Your permission.

1626
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:35,580
- You're mad at me, right?

1627
01:10:35,580 --> 01:10:38,753
- Look, Al, you're a good investigator.

1628
01:10:38,753 --> 01:10:39,720
- Thanks.
- But you stink

1629
01:10:39,720 --> 01:10:41,430
as a human being.

1630
01:10:41,430 --> 01:10:42,270
There you happy?

1631
01:10:42,270 --> 01:10:43,237
I said talk it.
- What are you talking

1632
01:10:43,237 --> 01:10:44,070
about stink?
- No, of course

1633
01:10:44,070 --> 01:10:45,450
you're not happy 'cause you're fucked.

1634
01:10:45,450 --> 01:10:47,610
I'm fucked and in 24 hours,

1635
01:10:47,610 --> 01:10:49,050
we're both gonna be on the street.

1636
01:10:49,050 --> 01:10:49,883
- Right, right.

1637
01:10:49,883 --> 01:10:51,480
I, I should be so lucky.

1638
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:53,040
Let me just tell you for your information,

1639
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:54,540
I gotta stay in the system.

1640
01:10:54,540 --> 01:10:55,770
I got a mortgage to pay.

1641
01:10:55,770 --> 01:10:58,830
Dentist bills, my kid
goes to ballet classes.

1642
01:10:58,830 --> 01:11:00,180
They're gonna stick me in a toll booth

1643
01:11:00,180 --> 01:11:02,313
inspecting stickers for mileage tax.

1644
01:11:03,660 --> 01:11:05,010
You, you could do anything.

1645
01:11:13,812 --> 01:11:15,820
(group chattering)

1646
01:11:15,820 --> 01:11:19,860
I wasn't thinking about
losing my big break.

1647
01:11:19,860 --> 01:11:21,663
That didn't seem to matter anymore.

1648
01:11:22,860 --> 01:11:23,693
And it dawned on me

1649
01:11:23,693 --> 01:11:27,240
that I didn't always truly
accept responsibility

1650
01:11:27,240 --> 01:11:29,283
for the consequences of my actions.

1651
01:11:30,540 --> 01:11:32,313
As much as I tried to fight it,

1652
01:11:33,540 --> 01:11:35,400
I couldn't escape thinking

1653
01:11:35,400 --> 01:11:37,383
I was the one who got Andre killed.

1654
01:11:57,914 --> 01:11:59,677
(suspenseful music)

1655
01:11:59,677 --> 01:12:02,427
(brooding music)

1656
01:12:08,250 --> 01:12:09,263
- [Clerk] Next please.

1657
01:12:18,545 --> 01:12:19,710
- [Al] What's that?

1658
01:12:19,710 --> 01:12:20,543
- You'll see.

1659
01:12:24,420 --> 01:12:25,253
See anything yet?

1660
01:12:25,253 --> 01:12:26,493
- No, just more the same.

1661
01:12:27,720 --> 01:12:29,365
- What is this?

1662
01:12:29,365 --> 01:12:34,365
- Well, it's not a potato knish.

1663
01:12:36,240 --> 01:12:37,593
It's not a blueberry knish.

1664
01:12:39,864 --> 01:12:41,613
It's not even a jelly donut.

1665
01:12:43,277 --> 01:12:48,277
But you'll see.

1666
01:12:48,877 --> 01:12:49,794
Huh?
- Nice.

1667
01:12:53,325 --> 01:12:54,158
$15?

1668
01:12:55,045 --> 01:12:55,937
What are you crazy?

1669
01:12:55,937 --> 01:12:57,840
$15 is eight ounces of pate.

1670
01:12:57,840 --> 01:12:59,310
This is eight ounces of food I can't eat.

1671
01:12:59,310 --> 01:13:00,660
I'm not paying for this.

1672
01:13:00,660 --> 01:13:01,830
- Well, I already paid for it.

1673
01:13:01,830 --> 01:13:02,790
- Oh, okay.
- Besides, you know,

1674
01:13:02,790 --> 01:13:05,790
you taught me about
knishes and all and so now-

1675
01:13:05,790 --> 01:13:06,664
- This, what's this?

1676
01:13:06,664 --> 01:13:07,497
- I'm gonna teach you
about the finer foods.

1677
01:13:07,497 --> 01:13:09,163
- Look how soft this is. This is bad.

1678
01:13:09,163 --> 01:13:09,996
- It's brie.

1679
01:13:09,996 --> 01:13:11,520
- You gotta get your money back for this.

1680
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:12,870
- It's supposed to be soft.

1681
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:14,800
- Supposed to stink?

1682
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:16,930
- Yeah, that's what makes it good.

1683
01:13:16,930 --> 01:13:19,059
- [Al] Good, then you eat it.

1684
01:13:19,059 --> 01:13:20,583
Here's another thing I can't eat.

1685
01:13:20,583 --> 01:13:22,530
So I guess you're officially broke, huh?

1686
01:13:22,530 --> 01:13:23,610
- Yep.

1687
01:13:23,610 --> 01:13:24,443
Here.

1688
01:13:25,710 --> 01:13:26,543
- Thanks.

1689
01:13:26,543 --> 01:13:27,453
- Salute.

1690
01:13:27,453 --> 01:13:28,286
- Right.

1691
01:13:32,970 --> 01:13:33,803
That's good.

1692
01:13:35,130 --> 01:13:36,303
- Sheer poetry.

1693
01:13:44,747 --> 01:13:47,247
(Al coughing)

1694
01:13:49,821 --> 01:13:52,488
(ominous music)

1695
01:13:57,255 --> 01:13:58,088
What?

1696
01:13:58,088 --> 01:13:59,633
- There's a guy.

1697
01:13:59,633 --> 01:14:01,550
- What?
- There's a guy.

1698
01:14:07,831 --> 01:14:10,498
(lock clicking)

1699
01:14:12,733 --> 01:14:15,400
(lock clicking)

1700
01:14:23,033 --> 01:14:23,866
(cork pops)

1701
01:14:23,866 --> 01:14:26,248
- This place is closing in a half an hour.

1702
01:14:26,248 --> 01:14:27,158
(air hissing)

1703
01:14:27,158 --> 01:14:28,110
Oh, you missed.

1704
01:14:28,110 --> 01:14:29,010
- For you I missed.

1705
01:14:29,010 --> 01:14:30,018
I hit the horse.

1706
01:14:30,018 --> 01:14:31,142
- No, you didn't.

1707
01:14:31,142 --> 01:14:33,060
- That's a horse, isn't it?

1708
01:14:33,060 --> 01:14:34,350
- All right, come on.

1709
01:14:34,350 --> 01:14:35,183
Watch this then.

1710
01:14:37,302 --> 01:14:38,716
(air hissing)

1711
01:14:38,716 --> 01:14:40,519
- [Al] Oh, you got his dick.

1712
01:14:40,519 --> 01:14:44,102
- [Joseph] I used to
be a spitball champion

1713
01:14:45,110 --> 01:14:46,268
in my lunch room.

1714
01:14:46,268 --> 01:14:47,847
Okay, watch that.

1715
01:14:47,847 --> 01:14:50,347
(air hissing)

1716
01:14:51,826 --> 01:14:52,956
- Wait a minute, wait a minute.

1717
01:14:52,956 --> 01:14:55,956
(suspenseful music)

1718
01:15:22,695 --> 01:15:24,679
(man chattering)

1719
01:15:24,679 --> 01:15:28,155
(woman and man gasps)

1720
01:15:28,155 --> 01:15:30,319
Yes, we're late for a meeting.

1721
01:15:30,319 --> 01:15:31,852
(door bangs)

1722
01:15:31,852 --> 01:15:34,068
- [Man] Tell him I wanna
see him as soon as possible.

1723
01:15:34,068 --> 01:15:35,493
- Mr. Green, please.

1724
01:15:35,493 --> 01:15:37,410
Could you tell him there's a runner here

1725
01:15:37,410 --> 01:15:39,240
with a package for him?

1726
01:15:39,240 --> 01:15:41,070
Well, he has to sign for it personally.

1727
01:15:41,070 --> 01:15:42,630
Mm-hmm.

1728
01:15:42,630 --> 01:15:43,620
Morgan, Mandelson, and Chase.

1729
01:15:43,620 --> 01:15:45,132
Good afternoon.

1730
01:15:45,132 --> 01:15:47,680
No, I'm sorry, he's in a
meeting. Can I take a message?

1731
01:15:47,680 --> 01:15:49,410
(phone ringing)

1732
01:15:49,410 --> 01:15:50,370
Morgan, Mandelson, and Chase.

1733
01:15:50,370 --> 01:15:51,870
Good afternoon.

1734
01:15:51,870 --> 01:15:52,703
Well, he's in a meeting.

1735
01:15:52,703 --> 01:15:53,880
Would you like to hold?

1736
01:15:53,880 --> 01:15:55,823
Oh, you'd like to leave a message, okay.

1737
01:15:57,360 --> 01:15:58,380
Morgan, Mandelson, and Chase.

1738
01:15:58,380 --> 01:15:59,283
Good afternoon.

1739
01:16:01,170 --> 01:16:03,204
Yes, I'll put you right through.

1740
01:16:03,204 --> 01:16:05,039
- [Kenneth] How you doing?

1741
01:16:05,039 --> 01:16:05,882
- Morgan, Mandelson, and Chase.

1742
01:16:05,882 --> 01:16:07,417
Good afternoon.

1743
01:16:07,417 --> 01:16:08,493
- Thank you very much.

1744
01:16:08,493 --> 01:16:10,710
- Hey, hey, Al Benjamin, state tax.

1745
01:16:10,710 --> 01:16:11,672
Can I talk to you for a minute?

1746
01:16:11,672 --> 01:16:12,540
- NYPD.

1747
01:16:12,540 --> 01:16:13,620
- Whoa, whoa.

1748
01:16:13,620 --> 01:16:14,730
Hey, what is this?

1749
01:16:14,730 --> 01:16:15,702
- Listen, you want me to blurt it out

1750
01:16:15,702 --> 01:16:17,820
in the open to everybody here
or you want some privacy?

1751
01:16:17,820 --> 01:16:18,937
Makes no difference to me.

1752
01:16:18,937 --> 01:16:20,340
- Is there some kind of problem?

1753
01:16:20,340 --> 01:16:21,900
- We don't have one, but you do.

1754
01:16:21,900 --> 01:16:24,304
- [Secretary] Mr. Green,
should I call security?

1755
01:16:24,304 --> 01:16:25,230
- No, no.

1756
01:16:25,230 --> 01:16:28,140
Uh, see if the conference room is free.

1757
01:16:28,140 --> 01:16:31,023
Okay, so what is it I
can do for you gentlemen?

1758
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:36,450
- Uh, well, you, you can
make your life a hell

1759
01:16:36,450 --> 01:16:39,270
of a lot easier if you answer
a couple of questions for me

1760
01:16:39,270 --> 01:16:41,370
but very, very truthfully.

1761
01:16:41,370 --> 01:16:43,680
- There's nothing I
know that could possibly

1762
01:16:43,680 --> 01:16:46,320
be of any interest to either of you.

1763
01:16:46,320 --> 01:16:49,765
- Well, I'm gonna ask you
anyway, and if you lie to me,

1764
01:16:49,765 --> 01:16:51,570
I'm gonna make sure that
you spend the next 15 years

1765
01:16:51,570 --> 01:16:53,490
of your life inside a federal prison

1766
01:16:53,490 --> 01:16:56,303
for not filing a cash
transaction over $10,000.

1767
01:16:56,303 --> 01:16:58,260
Now the first question is

1768
01:16:58,260 --> 01:17:01,530
into whose account are
these checks going, sir?

1769
01:17:01,530 --> 01:17:03,480
- [Joseph] Mr. Green, we
know that the account belongs

1770
01:17:03,480 --> 01:17:04,740
to someone at Black Sea Tuna

1771
01:17:04,740 --> 01:17:07,680
and we know that you are
just his business manager.

1772
01:17:07,680 --> 01:17:09,625
- I'm gonna call my attorney.

1773
01:17:09,625 --> 01:17:10,560
(phone beeping)

1774
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:14,010
- Let me do you a favor and
explain the facts of life.

1775
01:17:14,010 --> 01:17:15,990
If you decide to call your attorney,

1776
01:17:15,990 --> 01:17:17,850
we can no longer talk to you

1777
01:17:17,850 --> 01:17:20,370
because you will be a
criminal under investigation.

1778
01:17:20,370 --> 01:17:21,203
- [Al] And it's always better

1779
01:17:21,203 --> 01:17:23,163
to be a witness than a defendant.

1780
01:17:24,240 --> 01:17:28,353
- I don't, I can't possibly, I can't.

1781
01:17:30,570 --> 01:17:31,590
- [Joseph] If you are a witness,

1782
01:17:31,590 --> 01:17:33,150
you can still save your ass.

1783
01:17:33,150 --> 01:17:35,047
If you're a defendant,
your whole life is over.

1784
01:17:35,047 --> 01:17:36,265
- Cratchit and Elliot.
- Elliot please.

1785
01:17:36,265 --> 01:17:37,098
- Mr. Green.
- I'm sorry.

1786
01:17:37,098 --> 01:17:38,760
- This is the most important-
- On a conference call

1787
01:17:38,760 --> 01:17:39,651
right now.
- Decision you'll ever

1788
01:17:39,651 --> 01:17:40,484
have to make.
- Can I take your message?

1789
01:17:40,484 --> 01:17:41,317
- This is Kenneth Green,
tell him it's important.

1790
01:17:41,317 --> 01:17:43,110
- Save yourself, man.
- Certainly Mr. Green,

1791
01:17:43,110 --> 01:17:44,070
right away.
- Give yourself

1792
01:17:44,070 --> 01:17:45,900
a second chance.

1793
01:17:45,900 --> 01:17:46,733
Take care of your family.

1794
01:17:46,733 --> 01:17:48,030
- This is Elliot.
- Elliot.

1795
01:17:48,030 --> 01:17:49,740
- Think about your family.
- Who's this?

1796
01:17:49,740 --> 01:17:50,874
- It's me.
- No, fuck it.

1797
01:17:50,874 --> 01:17:51,707
- Ken.
- Let him talk to his lawyer.

1798
01:17:51,707 --> 01:17:52,939
- Ken, what's up?
- Elliot.

1799
01:17:52,939 --> 01:17:54,390
- Think about it, man.
- What?

1800
01:17:54,390 --> 01:17:56,970
- Think real hard.
- Hey, you there?

1801
01:17:56,970 --> 01:17:57,920
- [Kenneth] Elliot.

1802
01:17:59,183 --> 01:18:00,810
- [Elliot] Ken.

1803
01:18:00,810 --> 01:18:01,643
Ken, what matter?

1804
01:18:01,643 --> 01:18:02,579
You there, are you okay?

1805
01:18:02,579 --> 01:18:03,837
- I'll call you back.
- Ken.

1806
01:18:03,837 --> 01:18:06,337
(phone thuds)

1807
01:18:08,781 --> 01:18:12,053
(phone ringing)

1808
01:18:12,053 --> 01:18:13,118
(car horn honking)

1809
01:18:13,118 --> 01:18:14,190
(phone clicks)

1810
01:18:14,190 --> 01:18:15,023
- Cody.

1811
01:18:15,023 --> 01:18:15,856
- It's me.

1812
01:18:15,856 --> 01:18:16,800
We got him.

1813
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:18,720
We found the goddamn kapusta.

1814
01:18:18,720 --> 01:18:20,640
- You kidding?
- No, we got him.

1815
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:23,430
- This guy Sergei Utisov,
one Black Sea Tuna

1816
01:18:23,430 --> 01:18:24,660
is the kapusta.

1817
01:18:24,660 --> 01:18:25,680
No doubt.

1818
01:18:25,680 --> 01:18:26,947
His business manager said,

1819
01:18:26,947 --> 01:18:30,180
"That Utisov is worth
worth $130 million, right?"

1820
01:18:30,180 --> 01:18:32,880
I mean, there's chicken
ranches in Sierra Leon,

1821
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:34,709
warehouses in-
- Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe,

1822
01:18:34,709 --> 01:18:37,830
I don't care about the
warehouses in Germany.

1823
01:18:37,830 --> 01:18:39,090
Are you sure this is the guy

1824
01:18:39,090 --> 01:18:40,830
that put together the Geofuel deal?

1825
01:18:40,830 --> 01:18:41,663
- This is the guy.

1826
01:18:41,663 --> 01:18:42,870
This is the kapusta.

1827
01:18:42,870 --> 01:18:45,330
Al's headed over to the guy's
factory right now as we speak.

1828
01:18:45,330 --> 01:18:48,240
- Al knows not to arrest this guy

1829
01:18:48,240 --> 01:18:50,490
until we get an arrest
warrant signed, right?

1830
01:18:51,630 --> 01:18:52,463
Right?

1831
01:18:53,700 --> 01:18:56,610
- [Al] Romero called the
DMV and pegged Utisov's car,

1832
01:18:56,610 --> 01:19:00,810
a black '83 Porsche plate number TRO793.

1833
01:19:00,810 --> 01:19:05,070
So there he was the kapusta,
the mystery man himself.

1834
01:19:05,070 --> 01:19:08,010
I was eyeballing the guy who
put the whole scam together

1835
01:19:08,010 --> 01:19:10,500
and he looked like he was
in a hurry to leave town.

1836
01:19:10,500 --> 01:19:13,080
I figured that when we
grabbed his business manager,

1837
01:19:13,080 --> 01:19:15,630
we hit a trip wire and he
knew his cover was blown.

1838
01:19:18,623 --> 01:19:23,623
(car door bangs)
(traffic humming)

1839
01:19:27,180 --> 01:19:29,160
- Look, I gotta get a warrant right away.

1840
01:19:29,160 --> 01:19:31,830
There's gotta be one federal
judge in the Eastern District

1841
01:19:31,830 --> 01:19:33,180
working after five o'clock.

1842
01:19:34,530 --> 01:19:35,530
What about Weinberg?

1843
01:19:38,070 --> 01:19:39,420
You gotta be kidding me.

1844
01:19:39,420 --> 01:19:40,253
Uh.

1845
01:19:43,574 --> 01:19:45,059
(suspenseful music)

1846
01:19:45,059 --> 01:19:45,892
(door clicks)

1847
01:19:45,892 --> 01:19:46,920
Judge Dickerson.

1848
01:19:46,920 --> 01:19:47,753
- What's going on?

1849
01:19:47,753 --> 01:19:48,750
Did you get a warrant?

1850
01:19:48,750 --> 01:19:50,150
- What, what about Jacobson?

1851
01:19:51,450 --> 01:19:52,283
Ah, come on.

1852
01:19:53,340 --> 01:19:56,018
Let's try judges outside of Brooklyn.

1853
01:19:56,018 --> 01:19:59,163
Uh, judges outside of, would
you gimme a second here?

1854
01:20:00,720 --> 01:20:03,450
Come on, there has gotta
be one federal judge

1855
01:20:03,450 --> 01:20:06,093
in the Eastern District
still working right now.

1856
01:20:15,210 --> 01:20:17,010
Let's try Staten Island.

1857
01:20:17,010 --> 01:20:17,940
I'll be here all night.

1858
01:20:17,940 --> 01:20:20,220
Yes, yes, yes.

1859
01:20:20,220 --> 01:20:21,053
Oh, oh, oh.

1860
01:20:22,230 --> 01:20:23,063
Uniondale.

1861
01:20:24,690 --> 01:20:26,140
There's a judge in Uniondale?

1862
01:20:27,462 --> 01:20:29,313
He, he, he'll be there by seven.

1863
01:20:30,150 --> 01:20:30,983
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

1864
01:20:30,983 --> 01:20:32,276
he'll be there by, he'll
be, he'll be, yeah.

1865
01:20:32,276 --> 01:20:33,793
Yeah, he'll be there by seven.

1866
01:20:33,793 --> 01:20:36,210
- [Announcer] Florida East flight 177,

1867
01:20:36,210 --> 01:20:37,893
now arriving at gate 35.

1868
01:20:38,790 --> 01:20:41,251
Florida East Flight number 177,

1869
01:20:41,251 --> 01:20:43,977
now arriving at gate 35.

1870
01:20:43,977 --> 01:20:45,030
- Can you hold on one second?

1871
01:20:45,030 --> 01:20:47,160
I, I got a call coming
in on the other line.

1872
01:20:47,160 --> 01:20:47,993
Cody.

1873
01:20:47,993 --> 01:20:49,170
- [Al] Cody, it's me.

1874
01:20:49,170 --> 01:20:50,100
- [Peyton] Al, where are you?

1875
01:20:50,100 --> 01:20:51,090
- JFK.

1876
01:20:51,090 --> 01:20:52,050
This guy's grabbing a ticket.

1877
01:20:52,050 --> 01:20:53,160
I gotta, I gotta take him down.

1878
01:20:53,160 --> 01:20:53,993
- Al, don't touch him.

1879
01:20:53,993 --> 01:20:55,740
Romero's on his way to a
night court in Uniondale

1880
01:20:55,740 --> 01:20:56,790
to get an arrest warrant signed.

1881
01:20:56,790 --> 01:20:57,623
- Look what do you want me to do?

1882
01:20:57,623 --> 01:20:59,490
The guy's walking to the
gate. He's flying to Miami.

1883
01:20:59,490 --> 01:21:00,323
We're gonna lose him.

1884
01:21:00,323 --> 01:21:01,156
- Get on a plane.

1885
01:21:01,156 --> 01:21:03,090
Don't touch him, just follow him.

1886
01:21:03,090 --> 01:21:03,923
- I can't, I can't.

1887
01:21:03,923 --> 01:21:06,480
My, my credit card's maxed out.

1888
01:21:06,480 --> 01:21:09,780
- Al, we'll pay for it
with my credit card.

1889
01:21:09,780 --> 01:21:11,970
A agent will meet you
at Miami International.

1890
01:21:11,970 --> 01:21:13,140
What airline?
- Florida East.

1891
01:21:13,140 --> 01:21:14,547
Will ya hurry?

1892
01:21:14,547 --> 01:21:15,380
(phone thuds)

1893
01:21:15,380 --> 01:21:19,173
(plane engine roaring)

1894
01:21:19,173 --> 01:21:22,673
(man speaking in Russian)

1895
01:21:31,050 --> 01:21:32,400
- You Al Benjamin?
- Yeah.

1896
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:34,050
- Agent Johanson, FBI.

1897
01:21:34,050 --> 01:21:36,250
- Schmuck, you want the
whole world to know?

1898
01:21:37,110 --> 01:21:37,943
Yeah, Cody, it's me.

1899
01:21:37,943 --> 01:21:39,240
Listen, I'm in the car with Johanson.

1900
01:21:39,240 --> 01:21:40,073
You get the warrant yet?

1901
01:21:40,073 --> 01:21:42,630
- I, I, I gotta open line
to the Uniondale courthouse.

1902
01:21:42,630 --> 01:21:43,463
- [Al] What?

1903
01:21:43,463 --> 01:21:44,340
- Romero should be there any second.

1904
01:21:44,340 --> 01:21:45,390
- You gotta be kidding me.

1905
01:21:45,390 --> 01:21:46,680
You mean I made it all the way to Florida

1906
01:21:46,680 --> 01:21:48,182
he's still stuck in traffic?

1907
01:21:48,182 --> 01:21:51,099
(insects chirping)

1908
01:21:54,960 --> 01:21:56,640
Please, we gotta get this warrant.

1909
01:21:56,640 --> 01:21:57,960
- Al, would you sit tight?

1910
01:21:57,960 --> 01:21:59,117
Would you sit tight?

1911
01:21:59,117 --> 01:22:01,620
(car door bangs)

1912
01:22:01,620 --> 01:22:03,600
Just stay with him, Al.

1913
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:04,860
Yes, I'm still here.

1914
01:22:10,352 --> 01:22:13,100
(car door clicks)

1915
01:22:13,100 --> 01:22:15,302
(car door bangs)

1916
01:22:15,302 --> 01:22:17,087
(car door clicks)

1917
01:22:17,087 --> 01:22:17,920
- Yeah.

1918
01:22:18,930 --> 01:22:21,090
Yeah, look, Cody, we're gat a peer,

1919
01:22:21,090 --> 01:22:21,923
they're walking down.

1920
01:22:21,923 --> 01:22:24,120
It looks like they're getting on a boat.

1921
01:22:24,120 --> 01:22:25,593
He's gonna sail to Cuba or something.

1922
01:22:25,593 --> 01:22:26,426
Cody.
- Al.

1923
01:22:26,426 --> 01:22:30,790
- [Al] I gotta grab this guy.
- Don't do anything stupid.

1924
01:22:30,790 --> 01:22:31,623
(insects chirping)

1925
01:22:31,623 --> 01:22:33,300
We have to do this by the book.

1926
01:22:33,300 --> 01:22:34,800
We've worked too hard for this.

1927
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:35,725
Don't blow it.

1928
01:22:35,725 --> 01:22:38,308
(wind blowing)

1929
01:22:40,860 --> 01:22:42,570
- [Judge] Mr. Cody,
Officer Romero has arrived

1930
01:22:42,570 --> 01:22:43,740
and I'm giving him the warrant.

1931
01:22:43,740 --> 01:22:44,573
- Thank you.

1932
01:22:45,510 --> 01:22:46,560
Al, we got it.

1933
01:22:46,560 --> 01:22:47,760
We got it.
- Way to go.

1934
01:22:48,883 --> 01:22:51,785
(phone thuds)

1935
01:22:51,785 --> 01:22:52,618
- Yes!

1936
01:22:52,618 --> 01:22:57,618
(insects chirping)
(water splashing)

1937
01:22:57,686 --> 01:23:01,353
(Sergei speaking in Russia)

1938
01:23:03,096 --> 01:23:06,263
(boat engine roaring)

1939
01:23:16,040 --> 01:23:17,310
- Hey, hey, hey!

1940
01:23:17,310 --> 01:23:18,180
Federal warrant, you're under arrest.

1941
01:23:18,180 --> 01:23:19,013
Get over here.

1942
01:23:19,013 --> 01:23:20,164
Get off the boat.

1943
01:23:20,164 --> 01:23:21,496
(man speaking in Russian)

1944
01:23:21,496 --> 01:23:22,616
(gun banging)

1945
01:23:22,616 --> 01:23:25,448
(gun bangs)
(Johanson groans)

1946
01:23:25,448 --> 01:23:26,397
(man groaning)

1947
01:23:26,397 --> 01:23:27,980
Get up now!

1948
01:23:27,980 --> 01:23:30,033
Put your hands on your head!
Get off the fucking boat now!

1949
01:23:31,410 --> 01:23:32,797
Get down, down.

1950
01:23:32,797 --> 01:23:34,800
- Get down!
- You all right?

1951
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:36,430
- Yeah.

1952
01:23:36,430 --> 01:23:39,300
- All right, look, here's the phone.

1953
01:23:39,300 --> 01:23:40,337
Call for backup.

1954
01:23:42,308 --> 01:23:44,426
- [Johanson] Don't move.

1955
01:23:44,426 --> 01:23:46,383
Don't move, keep your
hands where I can see 'em.

1956
01:23:46,383 --> 01:23:48,800
- [Man] All right, all right.

1957
01:23:51,537 --> 01:23:53,076
- [Johanson] Yeah, man down.

1958
01:23:53,076 --> 01:23:53,909
Man down.

1959
01:23:53,909 --> 01:23:56,576
(boat creaking)

1960
01:24:00,958 --> 01:24:03,375
(Al panting)

1961
01:24:05,735 --> 01:24:06,682
(Al gasps)

1962
01:24:06,682 --> 01:24:09,099
(Al panting)

1963
01:24:10,467 --> 01:24:13,530
- Hey Sergei, come on out, man.

1964
01:24:13,530 --> 01:24:15,180
Both your guys are down.

1965
01:24:15,180 --> 01:24:16,740
One's dead.

1966
01:24:16,740 --> 01:24:18,890
The coast guard's gonna
be here any second.

1967
01:24:21,630 --> 01:24:24,970
Look, you don't wanna do this.

1968
01:24:27,210 --> 01:24:29,643
What, we're gonna try to kill each other?

1969
01:24:30,840 --> 01:24:31,673
Nah.

1970
01:24:33,960 --> 01:24:35,193
- [Sergei] I come out.

1971
01:24:35,193 --> 01:24:36,030
- Come on out.

1972
01:24:36,030 --> 01:24:38,603
- [Sergei] I come out.
- [Al] Let's see your hands.

1973
01:24:38,603 --> 01:24:41,010
- Do not shoot.
- Take it easy.

1974
01:24:41,010 --> 01:24:42,570
Let me see those hands.

1975
01:24:42,570 --> 01:24:43,403
Good.

1976
01:24:44,323 --> 01:24:45,156
(metal clangs)

1977
01:24:45,156 --> 01:24:45,989
No, no, no!

1978
01:24:45,989 --> 01:24:47,067
Hands in the air.

1979
01:24:47,067 --> 01:24:48,243
- No, no pistol.

1980
01:24:51,720 --> 01:24:52,860
- Hands up.

1981
01:24:52,860 --> 01:24:54,000
Come on.

1982
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:55,053
Come this way.

1983
01:24:59,040 --> 01:25:00,690
Let me see those hands.

1984
01:25:00,690 --> 01:25:01,523
Good.

1985
01:25:01,523 --> 01:25:02,457
- With uh-

1986
01:25:02,457 --> 01:25:04,440
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, slowly.

1987
01:25:04,440 --> 01:25:05,344
What?

1988
01:25:05,344 --> 01:25:07,683
- I, I want to show you something.

1989
01:25:08,790 --> 01:25:10,080
- Nice and slow.

1990
01:25:10,080 --> 01:25:13,030
- [Sergei] Listen my
friend, it's not personal.

1991
01:25:13,030 --> 01:25:14,637
- Take it easy, take it easy.

1992
01:25:14,637 --> 01:25:18,030
- It's business, merely business.

1993
01:25:18,030 --> 01:25:18,993
How I make money.

1994
01:25:20,040 --> 01:25:23,193
How everybody make money.

1995
01:25:26,730 --> 01:25:28,104
- Whoa.

1996
01:25:28,104 --> 01:25:30,771
(siren wailing)

1997
01:25:32,700 --> 01:25:36,393
- Maybe this is big
opportunity for you, huh?

1998
01:25:37,674 --> 01:25:40,860
- Well, I must say, Sergei,
that's a very generous offer.

1999
01:25:40,860 --> 01:25:43,500
I mean, I could use this money.

2000
01:25:43,500 --> 01:25:45,933
Wow, I could take my kids to Disneyland.

2001
01:25:47,790 --> 01:25:50,883
I buy myself a nice fancy car.

2002
01:25:52,500 --> 01:25:54,700
Hell, I could even leave
the tax department.

2003
01:25:55,650 --> 01:25:58,140
It's not even like anybody's gonna care.

2004
01:25:58,140 --> 01:25:59,490
I mean, nobody's gonna pat me on the back

2005
01:25:59,490 --> 01:26:00,370
for arresting you

2006
01:26:02,190 --> 01:26:04,743
or even care that I,
that I stuff my pockets.

2007
01:26:10,620 --> 01:26:11,673
The truth is, uh,

2008
01:26:15,330 --> 01:26:17,403
truth is people like you piss me off.

2009
01:26:19,650 --> 01:26:24,650
And you, you have people
killed get in your way.

2010
01:26:26,869 --> 01:26:27,780
(tongue clicks)

2011
01:26:27,780 --> 01:26:32,780
And I think that I'll feel a lot better

2012
01:26:33,240 --> 01:26:35,670
knowing that I was the
guy that put you in jail.

2013
01:26:37,493 --> 01:26:40,143
(bell ringing)
(man whistling)

2014
01:26:40,143 --> 01:26:43,636
(tires screeching)

2015
01:26:43,636 --> 01:26:46,644
(group speaking in Russian)

2016
01:26:46,644 --> 01:26:47,927
- [Agent] Put your hands up!

2017
01:26:47,927 --> 01:26:50,036
(group chattering)

2018
01:26:50,036 --> 01:26:51,953
- [Agent 2] Get 'em up!

2019
01:26:53,162 --> 01:26:54,921
- [Agent 3] Get over there!

2020
01:26:54,921 --> 01:26:56,921
- [Agent 4] Nobody move!

2021
01:26:58,223 --> 01:27:03,223
(door bangs)
(group yelling)

2022
01:27:10,760 --> 01:27:11,593
- How ya doing?

2023
01:27:11,593 --> 01:27:13,470
I got 'em, I got 'em.

2024
01:27:13,470 --> 01:27:15,000
Remember me?

2025
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:15,833
Let's go.

2026
01:27:19,230 --> 01:27:20,430
(handcuffs clicking)

2027
01:27:20,430 --> 01:27:23,070
- Gee, for a tough guy, it
must be pretty embarrassing

2028
01:27:23,070 --> 01:27:25,293
being arrested by
someone's girlfriend, huh?

2029
01:27:27,810 --> 01:27:30,240
- Lady, today's your lucky day.

2030
01:27:30,240 --> 01:27:31,463
Gas is on the house.

2031
01:27:32,393 --> 01:27:34,226
You don't mind do you?

2032
01:27:38,078 --> 01:27:41,078
(suspenseful music)

2033
01:27:45,270 --> 01:27:48,211
- [Judge] The prosecution
may call its next witness.

2034
01:27:48,211 --> 01:27:50,736
(door clicks)

2035
01:27:50,736 --> 01:27:52,986
- [Man] Yeah, is that Misha?

2036
01:27:52,986 --> 01:27:55,350
(door bangs)
(group chattering)

2037
01:27:55,350 --> 01:27:56,790
- [Man 2] Some businessman.

2038
01:27:56,790 --> 01:27:58,483
- [Al] Wouldn't you know it?

2039
01:27:58,483 --> 01:28:00,233
I finally got my shot at greatness.

2040
01:28:01,320 --> 01:28:03,270
- [Peyton] That the defendants are guilty.

2041
01:28:03,270 --> 01:28:05,633
- My vindication.
- Of conspiring to defraud-

2042
01:28:05,633 --> 01:28:07,720
- My validation.
- The United States-

2043
01:28:07,720 --> 01:28:09,360
- But I didn't get-
- State of New York

2044
01:28:09,360 --> 01:28:12,210
out of hundreds of millions of dollars.

2045
01:28:12,210 --> 01:28:13,440
- [Al] Any forgiveness.

2046
01:28:13,440 --> 01:28:15,843
- [Judge] As to count
one, how do you find?

2047
01:28:16,680 --> 01:28:19,083
- Guilty as to all defendants.

2048
01:28:24,330 --> 01:28:25,890
- Four months later at the sentencing,

2049
01:28:25,890 --> 01:28:28,653
Topolev and Utisov got double digit time.

2050
01:28:30,150 --> 01:28:32,670
Plus they were looking at
eight counts of murder one.

2051
01:28:32,670 --> 01:28:36,870
But our Geofuel executives,
they got bupkis.

2052
01:28:36,870 --> 01:28:38,490
Two years probation.

2053
01:28:38,490 --> 01:28:41,340
After sentencing Cody
insisted we have a drink.

2054
01:28:41,340 --> 01:28:44,010
Cody by then was onto a new exciting case.

2055
01:28:44,010 --> 01:28:45,810
Romero had just left the police department

2056
01:28:45,810 --> 01:28:48,136
and was taking law school night courses.

2057
01:28:48,136 --> 01:28:51,210
(group laughing)

2058
01:28:51,210 --> 01:28:55,563
And me, my life hasn't changed at all.

2059
01:28:56,970 --> 01:28:58,504
I'm still a tax man.

2060
01:28:58,504 --> 01:29:02,671
(man singing in foreign language)

2061
01:29:03,780 --> 01:29:08,635
And like the good book says
everybody hates the tax man.

2062
01:29:08,635 --> 01:29:10,266
(man laughs)

2063
01:29:10,266 --> 01:29:14,433
(man singing in foreign language)

2064
01:29:15,903 --> 01:29:19,698
(man singing in foreign language)

2065
01:29:19,698 --> 01:29:21,334
(Joseph speaks in Russian)

2066
01:29:21,334 --> 01:29:23,220
(woman speaking in foreign language)

2067
01:29:23,220 --> 01:29:25,163
I don't know what the hell
you guys are celebrating.

2068
01:29:26,100 --> 01:29:27,273
Bad guys beat the rap.

2069
01:29:28,140 --> 01:29:31,140
- Al, we did pretty good
all things considered.

2070
01:29:31,140 --> 01:29:32,906
- Not all things considered.

2071
01:29:32,906 --> 01:29:34,939
- Come on, not gonna start that.

2072
01:29:34,939 --> 01:29:36,090
- I'm not gonna start anything.

2073
01:29:36,090 --> 01:29:38,280
- Al, you're missing the point.

2074
01:29:38,280 --> 01:29:40,140
It's not about the bad guys.

2075
01:29:40,140 --> 01:29:43,110
It's about the three of us
doing the best we could.

2076
01:29:43,110 --> 01:29:45,300
You gotta put everything in context.

2077
01:29:45,300 --> 01:29:47,340
We all have big plans.

2078
01:29:47,340 --> 01:29:50,572
Not all of them are gonna
work out to the fullest.

2079
01:29:50,572 --> 01:29:52,710
You try to do good, you,
you make some mistakes,

2080
01:29:52,710 --> 01:29:54,480
but you can't spend
your life keeping score.

2081
01:29:54,480 --> 01:29:57,180
- Yeah, but what, what about the guy

2082
01:29:57,180 --> 01:30:00,124
always said winning is the only thing?

2083
01:30:00,124 --> 01:30:01,320
(man speaking in foreign language)

2084
01:30:01,320 --> 01:30:04,800
- Whoever said that must have
been one miserable asshole.

2085
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:07,060
And I know for a fact that you are not.

2086
01:30:09,043 --> 01:30:13,210
(man singing in foreign language)

2087
01:30:15,322 --> 01:30:16,905
- Listen, remember?

2088
01:30:20,071 --> 01:30:21,330
- Yeah, I remember.

2089
01:30:21,330 --> 01:30:22,443
- Remember what?

2090
01:30:24,571 --> 01:30:28,738
(man singing in foreign language)

2091
01:30:30,030 --> 01:30:31,180
- Come on, let's dance.

2092
01:30:33,564 --> 01:30:34,647
In his honor.

2093
01:30:35,925 --> 01:30:36,758
Come on.

2094
01:30:39,290 --> 01:30:40,449
Come on.

2095
01:30:40,449 --> 01:30:41,824
- Who's honor?

2096
01:30:41,824 --> 01:30:43,491
- Nothing, no dance.

2097
01:30:49,516 --> 01:30:52,349
- Come on, Al, let's get up there.

2098
01:30:53,862 --> 01:30:54,695
Al.

2099
01:30:56,014 --> 01:30:58,344
Come on, let's dance.

2100
01:30:58,344 --> 01:31:03,344
Let it go.

2101
01:31:08,634 --> 01:31:13,056
(man singing in foreign language)

2102
01:31:13,056 --> 01:31:15,806
(brooding music)

2103
01:32:01,576 --> 01:32:03,100
Come on, Al, come on.

2104
01:32:03,100 --> 01:32:06,017
- [Joseph] Al, get off your tuchus.

2105
01:32:14,383 --> 01:32:17,112
Look out here comes the tax man.

2106
01:32:17,112 --> 01:32:19,553
(hands clapping)

2107
01:32:19,553 --> 01:32:23,720
(man singing in foreign language)

2108
01:32:45,721 --> 01:32:50,721
(dramatic music)
(group chattering)

2109
01:32:52,803 --> 01:32:55,553
(brooding music)

2110
01:34:03,870 --> 01:34:07,203
(gentle brooding music)

2111
01:35:27,847 --> 01:35:30,430
(gentle music)

2112
01:36:44,635 --> 01:36:47,968
(gentle dramatic music)
