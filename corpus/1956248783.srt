00:21:33,704 --> 00:21:35,807
Perhaps we can, uh,
perhaps we can, um...

521
00:21:35,873 --> 00:21:37,375
Wait, wait,
we changed the figures

522
00:21:37,442 --> 00:21:39,111
to reduce
some of our overhead.

523
00:21:39,176 --> 00:21:40,544
Uh, flip it.
Uh, carry the three.

524
00:21:40,612 --> 00:21:42,146
And then
we're looking at...

525
00:21:42,212 --> 00:21:43,213
Hell no.

526
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,415
[SIGHS]

527
00:21:46,084 --> 00:21:48,719
Wait, wait, wait, all right.
Hold up a second.

528
00:21:48,786 --> 00:21:51,756
All right. How about this?
We give you Play's cut,

529
00:21:51,823 --> 00:21:53,424

530
00:21:53,491 --> 00:21:55,894
You're buggin'. Check this out.
It's gonna be a G per show.

531
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:58,630
We'll take care of all the hotel
and the travel arrangements.

532
00:21:58,696 --> 00:22:00,864
That's as fair as it get.
I'm putting my foot down.

533
00:22:00,932 --> 00:22:03,067
Well, ladies,
lookie here.

534
00:22:03,134 --> 00:22:04,970
BOTH [IN UNISON]:
Lookie here, lookie here.

535
00:22:05,036 --> 00:22:06,171
Looks like Coldblood's deal

536
00:22:06,238 --> 00:22:07,805
is a little bit better
than this one.

537
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:11,076
And when you all become big-time
and can beat that 5.0.

538
00:22:11,142 --> 00:22:13,178
Give us a call.

539
00:22:14,746 --> 00:22:17,316
You know what?
It's too bad too

540
00:22:17,382 --> 00:22:21,887
because I was just about
to make me a new friend.

541
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:23,154
Sorry for you.

542
00:22:23,221 --> 00:22:24,989
Wait a minute.
We can work this out.

543
00:22:25,056 --> 00:22:27,558
Heh.

544
00:22:25,056 --> 00:22:27,558
Yo, hey, hey, yo.

545
00:22:27,625 --> 00:22:29,426
See you, bye.

546
00:22:27,625 --> 00:22:29,426
Slow.

547
00:22:29,492 --> 00:22:33,664
Damn, man,
we almost had them, man.

548
00:22:33,731 --> 00:22:36,701

It's for the kids.

00:23:05,562 --> 00:23:07,498
You know, something like
the warden used to,

562
00:23:07,565 --> 00:23:08,900
whether you like it
or not.

563
00:23:08,967 --> 00:23:10,535
I remember, one time
I was in jail,

564
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,770
I didn't eat the food,
they locked me in the hole.

565
00:23:12,837 --> 00:23:15,073
Six weeks down there
wondering why.

566
00:23:15,139 --> 00:23:17,074
Nobody came to visit.
No phone calls.

567
00:23:17,142 --> 00:23:18,844
No nothing. I'm just
down there storming

568
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:20,345
because I didn't eat
the damn food.

569
00:23:20,412 --> 00:23:22,880
I ain't got to eat the food
the warden give me.

00:23:22,946 --> 00:23:25,483
Chill out. We got the pardon.
We free.

571
00:23:25,549 --> 00:23:26,584
Chill out.

Oh, how you doing,

What you want?
200 pounds of chilies

575
00:23:31,422 --> 00:23:32,690

576
00:23:32,757 --> 00:23:33,824
You got it. No problem.

577
00:23:33,891 --> 00:23:35,961
Hey.

578
00:23:36,028 --> 00:23:38,429
Oh, look, what the fuck
we got here.

579
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:40,732
Three mark-ass
nappers.

580
00:23:40,798 --> 00:23:43,667
Fuck all that. what's up
with my order for Friday, huh?

581
00:23:43,734 --> 00:23:46,337
It depends on
what your bitch ass get.

582
00:23:46,404 --> 00:23:47,939
What the fuck you want,
some chilies,

583
00:23:48,006 --> 00:23:50,608
some cheese, spam, tuna,
some tomatoes?

584
00:23:50,674 --> 00:23:52,609
What the fuck
you want?

585
00:23:52,676 --> 00:23:54,311
Look out.
Look out, punk.

586
00:23:54,377 --> 00:23:55,512
Come on in, Big Dukey.

587
00:23:55,579 --> 00:23:57,347
Big Dukey?

588
00:23:55,579 --> 00:23:57,347
Dukey.

589
00:23:57,414 --> 00:23:59,517
Yo, man, it's obvious
this ain't no Benihana's.

590
00:23:59,584 --> 00:24:01,586
Know what I'm saying?
Man, this is all we want.

591
00:24:01,653 --> 00:24:04,355
Some chicken wings, hot dogs
and a case of 40s. Got that?

592
00:24:04,422 --> 00:24:06,458
First of all, you need
to calm the fuck down

593
00:24:06,523 --> 00:24:08,291
and go gargle, funky.

594
00:24:08,358 --> 00:24:10,093
Man, my name is Stinky.
Stinky, all right?

595
00:24:10,161 --> 00:24:12,931
Stinky, funky, smell bad,
it's all the same.

596
00:24:12,998 --> 00:24:14,699
Fuck all that, nigga,
your name is Funky

597
00:24:14,766 --> 00:24:17,936
because you come up in here
smelling like butt crack.

598
00:24:18,002 --> 00:24:20,271
Yo, squash all that.
The food better be on.

599
00:24:20,337 --> 00:24:21,539
You hear
what I'm saying?

600
00:24:21,606 --> 00:24:23,741
Look at this nigga,
Mr. Bowler, Mr. High Roller,

601
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:25,076
Mr. Flashing Fucking Money.

602
00:24:25,143 --> 00:24:27,612
Since you got it like that,
punk, pay a nigga now.

603
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:28,780
You got my food now?

604
00:24:28,846 --> 00:24:30,414
Or maybe do you have
my food now?

605
00:24:30,481 --> 00:24:31,982
That's what I'm saying.

606
00:24:30,481 --> 00:24:31,982
Dumb shit.

607
00:24:32,048 --> 00:24:33,250
Let me tell you something.

608
00:24:33,317 --> 00:24:36,121
You don't come in
making no goddamn demands.

609
00:24:36,186 --> 00:24:38,490
We will fuck around
your punk ass on the grill.

610
00:24:38,557 --> 00:24:40,424
Straight make
some barbecued bitch.

611
00:24:40,491 --> 00:24:44,561
No, bake all three punk asses,
make three-bitch pie now.

612
00:24:44,628 --> 00:24:46,496
Why don't we just give them
all the money now?

613
00:24:46,564 --> 00:24:47,832
Yo, forget that,
Kid, man.

614
00:24:47,898 --> 00:24:49,266
The original deal
was a deposit.

615
00:24:49,333 --> 00:24:51,469
I refused to be intimidated
by these three losers.

616
00:24:51,535 --> 00:24:53,805
That's bullshit, man.
It's just bullshit.

617
00:24:53,872 --> 00:24:55,907
Especially some midget
like you, hairy bastard.

618
00:24:55,972 --> 00:24:57,875
Kick it, cuz.

619
00:24:55,972 --> 00:24:57,875
Look here, motherfucker,

620
00:24:57,942 --> 00:25:00,745
I'll kick you in your nuts
and make your jaw swell.

621
00:25:00,811 --> 00:25:03,446
You think you want more,
you punk-ass, niggers, huh?

622
00:25:03,513 --> 00:25:04,448
Just give them the money.

623
00:25:04,516 --> 00:25:06,183
No, Kid.

624
00:25:04,516 --> 00:25:06,183
Look, okay.

625
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:07,751
Just have the food there.
Thank you.

626
00:25:07,818 --> 00:25:10,087
Yo, the food better be on.

627
00:25:07,818 --> 00:25:10,087
Your sister better be on.

628
00:25:10,154 --> 00:25:12,990
Your mother's on.

629
00:25:10,154 --> 00:25:12,990
Your grandmama's straight on.

630
00:25:13,057 --> 00:25:14,158
PLAY:
Check this out.

631
00:25:14,224 --> 00:25:17,026
After this tour you two
are gonna be the bomb.

632
00:25:17,094 --> 00:25:19,697
You're gonna blow up.

633
00:25:19,763 --> 00:25:23,067
Trust me. Trust me.

634
00:25:23,134 --> 00:25:24,635
Now you're gonna remember
to listen

635
00:25:24,702 --> 00:25:26,304
to that tape
I gave you, right?

636
00:25:26,369 --> 00:25:28,772
Of course, I listen to
anything worth holding onto,

637
00:25:28,839 --> 00:25:30,875
and believe me you two
definitely got something

638
00:25:30,942 --> 00:25:33,712
I got to get my hands on.
Word up, you know?

639
00:25:33,778 --> 00:25:36,247
Talent scouting
again, huh, heh.

640
00:25:36,314 --> 00:25:39,817
Play,
you workaholic.

641
00:25:41,419 --> 00:25:43,655
Know what? I gotta take care
of something real quick.

642
00:25:43,721 --> 00:25:46,257
I'll get right back at you.
We're gonna get into this.

643
00:25:46,324 --> 00:25:48,226
We're gonna get
into this.

644
00:25:48,292 --> 00:25:50,093
Janelle, what's up,
sweetheart?

645
00:25:50,161 --> 00:25:51,962
Tell me something,
Play.

646
00:25:52,029 --> 00:25:53,932
Doesn't it ever
bother you?

647
00:25:53,999 --> 00:25:54,999
What?

648
00:25:55,066 --> 00:25:57,269
Misleading women
the way you do.

649
00:25:57,335 --> 00:26:00,438
Misleading women?

650
00:25:57,335 --> 00:26:00,438
Yeah.

651
00:26:00,504 --> 00:26:03,007
Janelle,
they are a group.

652
00:26:03,074 --> 00:26:04,442
I am a manager.

653
00:26:04,509 --> 00:26:07,812
In the entertainment business,
they work together.

654
00:26:07,878 --> 00:26:08,812
I'm working with them.

655
00:26:08,879 --> 00:26:10,547
Come on, now,
you know my style.

656
00:26:10,615 --> 00:26:13,651
And helping yourself to some
while you're at it, right?

657
00:26:13,718 --> 00:26:17,421
You coming off like they're
supposed to be helpless females.

658
00:26:17,488 --> 00:26:18,890
I mean, let's think
about it here,

659
00:26:18,956 --> 00:26:21,491
has it occurred to you that
perhaps they're enjoying this

660
00:26:21,558 --> 00:26:23,962
just as much as I am?
Ever thought about that?

661
00:26:24,028 --> 00:26:27,565
Yeah, I have,
and it frightens me.

662
00:26:27,632 --> 00:26:29,234
Look, the sooner
we get this started,

663
00:26:29,299 --> 00:26:31,269
the sooner I can
get out of here.

664
00:26:31,336 --> 00:26:33,805
Now, did you reserve
the tuxes for the ushers?

665
00:26:33,871 --> 00:26:35,507
Yes, I reserved the tuxes
for the ushers

666
00:26:35,574 --> 00:26:36,941
and I'm gonna pay
for them too.

667
00:26:37,008 --> 00:26:39,544
That's the least you could do.
The bride pays for everything.

668
00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:41,244
And it'll be the last thing
she pays for.

669
00:26:41,311 --> 00:26:42,680
After that ring
is on her finger,

670
00:26:42,747 --> 00:26:44,782
that's her carte blanche
to do what she pleases.

671
00:26:44,848 --> 00:26:46,317
While my man's
breaking his back,

672
00:26:46,384 --> 00:26:48,752
because she turns
to the gimme gimme girl.

673
00:26:48,819 --> 00:26:49,953
I knew
you was primitive,

674
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:52,423
but I didn't think
you was a pure caveman.

675
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:55,594
I guess it goes down like that
with those gold-digging,

676
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:58,696
hoochie-mama, gut bucket
skeezas you attract,

677
00:26:58,762 --> 00:27:01,265
but tell me something, what
do you really have to offer?

678
00:27:01,331 --> 00:27:02,633
I mean, really?

679
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:05,036
Well, it just so happens
that what I have to offer

680
00:27:05,103 --> 00:27:07,337
might be more than
you can handle, Janelle.

681
00:27:07,404 --> 00:27:11,075
And when you are ready
to become a full-fledged woman,

682
00:27:11,142 --> 00:27:13,010
why don't
you give me a call?

683
00:27:13,077 --> 00:27:16,847
Baby, I'm full,
I'm fledged,

684
00:27:16,914 --> 00:27:18,548
and I'm all woman,

685
00:27:18,616 --> 00:27:22,987
but I need
more than a snack.

686
00:27:23,052 --> 00:27:24,555
I need a whole meal.

687
00:27:24,622 --> 00:27:26,491
Janelle, sweetheart,

688
00:27:26,557 --> 00:27:30,161
woman, I'll have
you talking in tongues.

689
00:27:32,762 --> 00:27:33,864
