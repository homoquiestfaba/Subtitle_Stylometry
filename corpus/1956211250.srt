1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,800
Previously on "desperate housewives"

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:05,900
the boys are in my class because I'm the
only teacher who can handle them.

3
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:08,500
We may no longer be able to accommodate them.

4
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,100
Ultimatums were made...

5
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:13,100
She used this to kill herself.
Why would you keep it?

6
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:15,100
Questions were asked...

7
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:16,700
Are you okay?

8
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:18,300
I think he's hiding something.

9
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,800
And lots of evidence

10
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,500
was uncovered.

11
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,400
Exactly what is it you've hired me to do?

12
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,403
Someone sent that note to my wife,
and I need to know who.

13
00:00:27,403 --> 00:00:29,400
You like Alfred Hitchcock?

14
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,000
I found it in the ruins of Edie's home.

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,100
I found it under our bed. It's not mine.

16
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:37,000
Talk about dirty laundry.

17
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:46,400
Every neighborhood has a woman like Alberta Frome,

18
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:50,400
and every woman like Mrs. Frome has a cat.

19
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:56,700
When she traveled, Mrs. Frome would arrange
for friends to look after her beloved pet.

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,800
This time, however, she was forced to
ask her neighbor Susan Mayer.

21
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,800
Mrs. Frome liked Susan,

22
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:09,000
but it was common knowledge on Wisteria Lane
where Susan Mayer went,

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,600
bad luck was sure to follow.

24
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:15,200
Her misfortunes ranged from the commonplace...

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,600
to the unusual...

26
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:24,000
To the truly bizarre.

27
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:33,200
As she waved goodbye, she worried that
Susan's streak of bad luck would continue.

28
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,000
For that matter, so did her cat.

29
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,600
- Mr. Whiskers.
- Kitty.

30
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:48,500
Dinner time.
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty.

31
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:50,900
That's weird.

32
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:53,700
Cats can't open drawers, can they?

33
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Are you sure you didn't leave
them open this morning?

34
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,100
No way.

35
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,600
Wow.

36
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,400
Do you think somebody broke in?

37
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,400
Mr. Whiskers?!
Mr. Whiskers?!

38
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:10,600
Mr. Whiskers?!
Mr. Whiskers?!

39
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,800
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty!

40
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,200
Oh, please don't let anything happen to
that cat. Mrs. Frome will kill me.

41
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,100
Mr. Whiskers?!

42
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:23,500
Though she didn't know it at the time,

43
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,800
Susan's luck...

44
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:29,700
had finally started to change.

45
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,440
<font color=F62B97>Episode 5 : Come in, Stranger

46
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:16,800
News that an intruder had breached the security
of Wisteria Lane spread like wildfire.

47
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,100
At a neighborhood watch meeting the next night,

48
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:25,000
residents voiced their concerns over the
increasing dangers their community faced.

49
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,400
Mrs. Ida Greenberg announced someone

50
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:31,000
was looking through her bathroom window
whenever she took a shower.

51
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,900
Bob Fisk warned those present that
an unnamed government agency

52
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:38,000
was listening in on their phone conversations.

53
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,700
Helen vale spoke of a ruthless local
teenage gang that had egged her minivan.

54
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,700
There are three factors that contribute to...

55
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:52,600
the evening concluded with Officer Thompson
offering safety tips and a plan of action.

56
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,200
But opportunity, you have some control over,

57
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,500
so you can sign up for either daily or nightly patrols.

58
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,400
And I know that might seem like overkill,

59
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:05,300
but I guarantee regular surveillance will deter
even the most determined criminal.

60
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:07,300
So are there any other questions?

61
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:10,200
All right, then. Let's be careful out there.

62
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,700
Actually, I do have a question.
Do you have a second?

63
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:16,700
Sure. How can I help?

64
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:19,300
Um, I'm the one who discovered the break-in,

65
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,200
and I think I found some evidence.

66
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,700
Evidence?

67
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:26,236
I think this is a screwdriver
left behind by the burglar,

68
00:04:26,236 --> 00:04:27,700
and I didn't touch it.

69
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,700
Well, why didn't you give this
to the investigating officers?

70
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:32,400
I tried, and they sort of laughed at me,

71
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,000
because apparently, nothing was
taken from Mrs. Frome's house.

72
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,900
Well, I apologize for that.
That was totally unprofessional.

73
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,200
Thank you.

74
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,000
Yeah.

75
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,700
So you think it should be dusted for prints?

76
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:44,500
Yes, and I'll make sure it gets done.

77
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,100
Great.

78
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:49,700
Bye.

79
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:55,900
& nbsp;

80
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:58,600
Boys, stop it. Go to bed.

81
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,700
But we're not tired.

82
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,800
Well, at least go upstairs.

83
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,900
Hey, look.

84
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,000
- Gimme!
- Oh, oh, oh.

85
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,700
- Gimme!
- Oh -- go!

86
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:09,900
- Go, go!
- Bye, bye!

87
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:10,900
Good night!

88
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,300
No, I want them!

89
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:15,200
Give me them! Give me them!
Hey, I want them!

90
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,200
So why weren't you sitting with Mike tonight?

91
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,800
I thought you two were becoming an item.

92
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,500
I sort of thought so, too.

93
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,200
I'm getting a lot of mixed signals.

94
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:25,800
I'll tell you who wasn't giving mixed signals
was that sexy officer Thompson.

95
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,500
He was staring at you all night.

96
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,700
You noticed that?

97
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:31,400
Honey, trust me -- when they're
not staring at me, I notice.

98
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,600
I really do appreciate you guys staying and helping.

99
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,100
Oh, please. I would have hosted it myself,

100
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:40,500
but the kids are going to the mountains tomorrow, and there's camping equipment everywhere.

101
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,000
It's nice of you, and

102
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,900
since we're talking, there's something
else nice that I'd like you to do.

103
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,900
Your kids both went to Barcliff Academy, didn't they?

104
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:48,800
Yes.

105
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,700
We need you to recommend Porter and Preston.

106
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,400
We can't even get an interview.

107
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,300
Oh, you, um, want me to recommend the twins?

108
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:58,300
Yes. You can tell them how beautifully behaved the boys are.

109
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,100
So you want me to lie.

110
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,200
Yeah. I thought that was understood.

111
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,300
Well, it's just that I'm very
well-respected at Barcliff,

112
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,800
and, um, my word won't be good there anymore.

113
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,400
Yes, but by the time they realize
their mistake, we'll be in.

114
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,800
You're not having any more kids.
What do you care?

115
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,800
Well, I had hoped someday to get
my grandchildren into Barcliff,

116
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,100
but I suppose that doesn't matter to you, does it?

117
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,900
It really doesn't.

118
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,800
Leave it alone.

119
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,700
You've got to get rid of it.
Doesn't it bother you?

120
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,500
I said leave it alone.

121
00:06:26,501 --> 00:06:29,400
No! No,
you can't stop me.

122
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,900
Paul and Zach are fighting again.

123
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,600
That's the second time this week.

124
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,400
They never used to fight like that
when Mary Alice was alive.

125
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,100
It's a shame. They used to be such a happy family.

126
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:42,000
Just because you didn't hear them fighting
doesn't mean they were happy.

127
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:56,500
The next day, as residents began to patrol Wisteria
Lane in the hopes of foiling potential burglars,

128
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:01,700
Gabrielle was about to experience
a home invasion of her own.

129
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,000
Mama Solis.

130
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,400
What are -- what are you doing here?

131
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,000
I came to visit my son and daughter-in-law.

132
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,100
What does it look like?

133
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,500
Does Carlos know you're coming?

134
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:19,000
No. He likes to be surprised.

135
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,300
Now come.

136
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:24,400
Gabrielle... come.

137
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,500
Family should always hug...

138
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:34,300
Regardless of how they feel about each other.

139
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:00,400
Wow, uh, she's a beauty.

140
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,400
Uh, 30-footer?

141
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,900
32.

142
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,100
Sweet. I sail.

143
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:07,500
I've -- I've got a flying scot.

144
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,100
Well, we have several yachting enthusiasts
here at barcliff academy,

145
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,803
and I'd be happy to introduce them to you.

146
00:08:11,803 --> 00:08:13,800
- Well, that sounds great.
- That's wonderful.

147
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,900
If we decide to enroll your children.

148
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:21,700
To be honest, Mr. And Mrs. Scavo,

149
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:27,200
your children's educational background is
a bit more common than we would prefer,

150
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:30,800
but Mrs. Van de Kamp mentioned
that they were identical twins.

151
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,600
Yes. Completely identical.

152
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,900
You can't tell them apart. They're like bookends.

153
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:37,300
We do strive for diversity here at Barcliff.

154
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:40,000
Identical twins could make for an interesting addition.

155
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,400
The boys are fascinating.

156
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:44,000
They even have their own twin
secret language. Don'they, Tom?

157
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Yeah. Yeah, it's pretty scary.

158
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,600
Well, it's not really so much
scary as highly developed.

159
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,400
Y-yeah, they -- they bark and growl at each other.

160
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,500
I'm sorry, Tom. Mr. Lenz was
trying to say something.

161
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,900
Sorry. Go ahead, Mr. Lenz.

162
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:58,200
I'd love to meet these twins of yours.

163
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,900
I tell you what -- I'm going to put
them on our must-meet list.

164
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,900
- Terrific.
- Thank you so much.

165
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,200
What is a must-meet list?

166
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,900
We bring them in for observation.

167
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,300
Observation?

168
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,900
Mm-hmm. To see how they play
with the other children,

169
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,800
how they respond to authority.

170
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,700
That sort of thing.

171
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,100
Great.

172
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,200
That sounds wonderful.

173
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,300
Hey.

174
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,400
Hi.

175
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,000
Kids ready?

176
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,100
Almost.
Thanks again for driving them to the bus.

177
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,400
Happy to do it.

178
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I miss them.

179
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,800
Did you hear there was a break-in
at Mrs. Frome's the other night?

180
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,400
Yeah. I heard they didn't take anything.

181
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,900
Well, that doesn't make it any less frightening.

182
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:49,300
I mean, he could have been a sexual predator.

183
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:51,800
Oh, and he ended up at Mrs. Frome's?

184
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,800
Boy, that would have been a lose-lose situation.

185
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:57,700
Rex. That's not the point.

186
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:01,300
The point is I don't feel safe, and I was
wondering if you could spend the night.

187
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:04,400
You're in the NRA. You own, like, four guns.

188
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:07,200
If somebody broke in, I'd expect you to protect me.

189
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:12,300
Rex, the truth is, with the kids gone,

190
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:16,600
I'll be all by myself in this house
for the first time in 17 years.

191
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,100
Honey, I know it's hard to hear, but the
marriage counseling might not work out.

192
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,700
You need to get used to being alone.

193
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:28,700
You're right. That was hard to hear.

194
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,200
What are you doing?

195
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,900
That is for the kids' trip.

196
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,300
Oh, come on.

197
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,800
I'm -- I'm staying at a motel.

198
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,500
I haven't had a decent meal in weeks.

199
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:42,300
Honey, the marriage counseling might not work out.

200
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,500
You need to get used to bad cooking.

201
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,200
Hey.

202
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,500
Screwdriver girl.

203
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:59,500
I just came by to tell you that I took
your evidence into the lab for fingerprints.

204
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,200
Oh, really? That's great.

205
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,700
So I'll call you if I hear something.

206
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:03,500
Okay.

207
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,900
Ooh!

208
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:07,400
- Sorry.
- Thanks.

209
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,700
Um, actually, I'd like to call you anyway,

210
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:10,800
if -- if that's okay.

211
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,300
Oh.

212
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:17,100
You seem like a really sweet guy
in an interesting line of work,

213
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:20,100
but I am not really available.

214
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,700
Oh. Oh. You have a boyfriend?

215
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,800
Yeah, sort of.

216
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,200
Sort of.

217
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:29,700
It's hard to explain... even to myself.

218
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:32,900
Unit 23, we have a 907a in progress at Stone and Maple. Please respond.

219
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,700
10-4. I'm on my way.

220
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,700
I got to go.
Apparently, there's a hostage situation.

221
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,200
Oh, wow.

222
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,600
So you're really turning me down.

223
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,700
Boy, my self-esteem can't take this.

224
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,000
I'm sorry.

225
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,700
No, it's just now my ability to help
those hostages has been compromised.

226
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:52,700
Still, don't -- don't blame yourself
for what might happen.

227
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:54,300
Blame myself.

228
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:58,700
Yeah, well, it's just hard to rescue folks
when you don't feel good about yourself.

229
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,400
Aah, they'll probably all die anyway.

230
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:04,500
Okay, fine. I'll go out with you.

231
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,200
Great. I'll call you.

232
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:10,600
Now that you've gotten your date, you can tell
me what that really means -- that 907a.

233
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,600
Someone's tv was playing too loud.

234
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,400
Well, thank god for the thin blue line.

235
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,300
I'll call you.

236
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,700
Ooh! Oh.

237
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,800
I'll be outside doing my yoga.

238
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,000
I'll be right back.

239
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:39,100
Do you have to do that now? My mother's here.

240
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:42,800
Hey, I'm not going to stop my life just because she
decides to show up -- unannounced, I might add.

241
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,100
She's family. She doesn't need an invitation.

242
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:47,700
Yeah, well, whatever. It's rude.

243
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,500
That's real pretty, mama.

244
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,100
You were always good with your hands.

245
00:12:56,100 --> 00:13:01,700
So, mijo, I assume you didn't insist
that I travel 2,000 miles for small talk.

246
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:03,500
So why am I here?

247
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,800
She...

248
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,200
is unhappy.

249
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,700
Mm-hmm.

250
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,900
I've given her everything she ever wanted,

251
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,900
but it doesn't seem to make a difference,

252
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:22,200
and I feel her drifting further and further away.

253
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:27,600
And lately I've started thinking that maybe...

254
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,300
so you think she's cheating on you?

255
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,100
I think so.

256
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:45,900
We can talk about your problems,

257
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:48,700
but I'm not going to have any of that.

258
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,300
Si.

259
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:54,600
Do you have any proof?

260
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,000
No, it's -- it's just a feeling.

261
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,200
I had that feeling with your father and that
whore waitress, and I was right.

262
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,500
Always trust your feelings.

263
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,900
So what do I do?

264
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,200
You don't do anything.

265
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,300
I'll take care of it.

266
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,300
Thank you, mama.

267
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:11,900
I'm sorry I had to hit you,

268
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:17,200
but we're strong people, and
we don't cry about our problems.

269
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:23,300
We find ways to fix them.

270
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:35,400
While the residentsof Wisteria Lane kept up their
patrols in an effort to prevent future break-ins,

271
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:40,000
Lynette hatched a plan to break her
children into Barcliff Academy.

272
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,800
Boys?

273
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,400
Wake up.

274
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,400
Come on.

275
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:48,100
We're going to have some fun today.

276
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:49,700
Come on.

277
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:50,700
Yeah.

278
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:51,500
Hey.

279
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,700
Hi.

280
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:58,200
Come on, I bet you can beat me!

281
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,100
Come on!

282
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:04,300
Go, go, go! Come on!

283
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:08,000
Yes, yes -- mush, doggies,
mush! Mush, mush, mush!

284
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,200
Mom, I'm tired. How long do we have to do this?

285
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:17,800
Hey, if I can still see your head,
the pool's not deep enough.

286
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:23,300
Are your boys usually so docile?

287
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:28,000
They're always a little shy at first.

288
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,700
Look at that concentration.

289
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:34,000
Porter loves his puzzles.

290
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,400
Hmm.

291
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,800
Mama, I'll be right back.

292
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,800
I'm going to the store.

293
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,300
Gabrielle.

294
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,300
I'm coming with you.

295
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,800
I want to make some tamales for Carlos.

296
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,900
No, no, Juanita, I'm not going to the supermarket.

297
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:06,000
I'm going to the lingerie store.

298
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,700
Good. I need some bras.

299
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:08,700
I'm going to be a while.

300
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,500
I might get a facial.

301
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,500
I have a face.

302
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:17,500
Hey, Mike.

303
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,500
Hey. How's it going?

304
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,600
Good, good.

305
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,400
Just came by to say hello.

306
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,500
Hello.

307
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:26,400
So you remember the cop from the
neighborhood watch meeting?

308
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:32,000
Uh, he agreed to run a fingerprint check on the
screwdriver I found at Mrs. Frome's house.

309
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,300
He did?

310
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,500
Nothing was taken.

311
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,600
But still, somebody broke in.

312
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,600
It is a crime.

313
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:43,400
So the weird thing is the cop
asked me out on a date.

314
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,500
Oh?

315
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:48,300
And I sort of said yes.

316
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:51,000
I was just curious what you thought about that.

317
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,800
You're asking my permission to go out with him?

318
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,200
No, no, I just, uh...

319
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,500
was wondering your opinion.

320
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,600
I don't really have one.

321
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,000
Okay.

322
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,300
Great. Fine.

323
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,700
Thank you.

324
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,900
Susan, wait, wait. I --

325
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:19,300
look, I'm sorry.

326
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:21,100
My life is just...

327
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:24,000
really complicated right now.

328
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,700
You don't have to explain.

329
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:26,800
No, Susan.

330
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,800
It's complicated. I get it.

331
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,400
Paul?

332
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,200
Paul.

333
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,600
Oh,

334
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,300
hi, Zachary. I'm sorry. The door was open, and --

335
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:50,100
it's okay. You can come in.

336
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:53,900
Is your, uh, father here? We were
scheduled to do a patrol today.

337
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:56,500
He had to go out of town -- again.

338
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,200
Oh.

339
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,500
Well, I guess I can do it by myself.

340
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,600
Wow.

341
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:10,100
This place is just immaculate.

342
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:11,800
My mom liked things clean.

343
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:15,000
Zach, she would be very proud of you.

344
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:17,900
What happened to your varnish?

345
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,300
That's where my mother died.

346
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:22,000
I messed up the floor trying to get out the blood.

347
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,100
Oh.

348
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:29,100
I'll let my dad know that you stopped by.

349
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,100
Okay.

350
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,700
Zach...

351
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:37,300
do you have plans for dinner?

352
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,400
So you shop a lot, huh?

353
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,400
Yeah. So?

354
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:53,700
Most women that shop a lot, it's because
they don't have anything better to do.

355
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,100
What's your point?

356
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,700
Well, if you had children...

357
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:57,400
here we go.

358
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:01,100
I'm just saying that children give your life a purpose.

359
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:05,700
You get so busy taking care of them that you
don't have any time to wonder if you're happy.

360
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,700
You know, Juanita, this is so like you.

361
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:11,100
I invite you on a nice shopping trip,
and you find ways to upset me.

362
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:14,200
Oh, you didn't invite me.
I invited myself.

363
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,700
You keep looking at your watch.

364
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,700
Is there someplace you have to be?

365
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,700
No!

366
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:21,757
You know, and for the record,

367
00:19:21,757 --> 00:19:25,000
I am not one of those women who has a hole in her
heart that can only be filled by a baby.

368
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I like my life a lot.

369
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,200
It's very fulfilling.

370
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:32,600
Excuse my daughter-in-law. She's very fulfilled.

371
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,000
So he just blew you off?

372
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,900
I told him another man asked me out.

373
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:42,000
It was the perfect opportunity for Mike
to be jealous, and nothing.

374
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,300
Did you bat your eyes?

375
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:45,000
You know, it doesn't work if you don't bat your eyes.

376
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,200
Honey, I batted everything that wasn't nailed down.
I'm telling you, nothing.

377
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,300
Oh, thanks.

378
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,600
So what's going on there?

379
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,200
Mm.

380
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,200
Gophers.

381
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,900
Wow.

382
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,300
Listen, I'm sorry about Mike.

383
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,300
I know how much you like him.

384
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,500
Aah, maybe it's my fault.

385
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:05,600
Maybe I just imagined an entire relationship
with this man that didn't exist.

386
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,600
There has been flirting. I have seen it.

387
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:14,800
Yeah, and the flirting made me think that he was kind
and trustworthy and honest and hygienic.

388
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:18,500
That's how it is with me -- a guy just
smiles at me three times,

389
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,500
and I'm picking out wedding china. I'm a mess.

390
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,700
But to be fair, that's part of your charm.

391
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,000
That's what happened with Carl.

392
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I only dated him a couple of months,
I filled in the blanks, I married him.

393
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,300
It was a disaster.

394
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:31,700
You think Mike is a carl in disguise?

395
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:32,700
I don't know.

396
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:37,000
What does that mean, anyway,
"my life is complicated"?

397
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,700
If I wanted to sit around and wait for nothing,

398
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:48,700
I could do it on the can. You're late.

399
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,800
What's with the face?

400
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:51,800
I screwed up.

401
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:54,300
I broke into the Frome's house
and almost got caught.

402
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,600
What's almost?

403
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,700
I accidentally left something
behind with my prints on it.

404
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:00,000
Did you ever hear of gloves?

405
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,700
It's the suburbs.

406
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,500
I didn't think it'd matter.

407
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:06,300
Anyway, the police are running
a check, and I'm in the system.

408
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:09,600
I got to pull up stakes before
they come looking for me.

409
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:14,100
That's a sweet sound --

410
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:16,600
laughter like that, huh?

411
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,100
Pisses me off.

412
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:22,500
If and when your cover is blown, you disappear.

413
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,200
Until then,

414
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:27,000
you keep fixing the neighbors' pipes.

415
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
The more time I spend in this town,
the more I think we're making a mistake.

416
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,200
These are nice people.

417
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,500
My money says one of them isn't.

418
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,500
Whoa.

419
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Thanks.

420
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:47,100
No more screwups.

421
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:04,800
I'm getting something to drink.
Do you want something?

422
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,400
Shh.

423
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,100
Look, don't be mad.

424
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:28,400
I waited at that motel for three hours for you.

425
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,700
I had to use a month's worth of lunch
money to pay for that room.

426
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,000
It's not my fault.

427
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,400
Juanita hasn't let me out of her
sight since she's gotten here.

428
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,300
Really?

429
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:38,000
Well, I don't see her now.

430
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,100
She's watching her Mexican soap opera.

431
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:45,700
The rebel's virgin daughter's about to be
seduced by the escaped despedo.

432
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,900
So until she puts out...

433
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,800
Juanita won't even know that I'm gone.

434
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,900
Come on. I said I was sorry.

435
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,300
You know, just so you know,

436
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,100
I've turned down half the pep squad for you.

437
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,900
You can't be serious.

438
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:01,400
No.

439
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,800
You know, I'm starting to think that

440
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,800
maybe I should be with someone my own age.

441
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:08,500
Well, I thought teenage girls bored you, John.

442
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,600
I thought what we had was beyond that.

443
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,900
So did I.

444
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:16,000
So then why do you want to go back
to something you don't want?

445
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,100
I don't know.

446
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:18,200
Maybe you're tired of me.

447
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,700
No.

448
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:20,900
I want to be with you.

449
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:23,200
Then why are we arguing?

450
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:25,300
Gabrielle!

451
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:26,400
Damn it!

452
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,300
The virgin gave it up already?

453
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:30,000
I want you so bad.

454
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,400
When can I see you again?

455
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,100
Tomorrow.

456
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:34,300
Meet me at the front entrance
of the mall after school.

457
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:35,700
What about your mother-in-law?

458
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:36,400
Don't worry.

459
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,700
I'll think of something.

460
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,300
Gabrielle! Gabrielle!

461
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:42,900
Coming!

462
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:47,300
A donation? Now Barcliff wants a donation?

463
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:50,300
Apparently we're in competition
with one other family.

464
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:53,500
A generous donation will ensure
our kids beat them out.

465
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,200
How generous?

466
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,200
$15,000.

467
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,900
We don't have that.

468
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:58,900
And that's what I told them.

469
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:00,700
So what do we do?

470
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:05,200
Public school is out unless
we move to a new district.

471
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,700
We're not moving.

472
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:13,700
Maybe it's time that we look into homeschooling.

473
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,800
I know you did not just say that.

474
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:18,100
Honey, it's it's got its advantages.

475
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:20,500
You know, kids in home school
do better in their later years.

476
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:23,800
They won't make it to their later years
if I have to spend all day with them.

477
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:27,100
Honey, sometimes you just --
you got to make the sacrifice.

478
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:29,900
It's probably the best thing for the kids.

479
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:33,000
Why don't we just put them back in me and
cook them until they're civilized?

480
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,500
You'd be cool with that?

481
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,400
I've never had plum pudding before.

482
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,800
I'm serving it this year for Christmas.

483
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:46,100
I like to try out new recipes before the actual holiday.

484
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:48,800
That way if the cookbook's gotten it wrong,

485
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,500
I can fix it.

486
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,600
You must really like Christmas.

487
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:56,100
You and Mr. Van de Kamp always have
the best decorations on your lawn.

488
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,900
I adore the holidays.

489
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:01,300
I never get depressed if there's a beautifully
decorated tree to look at.

490
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:04,600
My mom and I would always decorate
our tree together.

491
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,500
This Christmas is going to be weird.

492
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,800
Oh, Zach.

493
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,100
You know...

494
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,900
my mother died when I was young.

495
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:14,700
She was hit by a car.

496
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,800
Oh.

497
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,900
It was, um,

498
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:20,300
right before christmas, as a matter of fact.

499
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:24,400
We were all singing carols, and the dog was howling

500
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:28,100
because everybody in my family
sings off-key except for me.

501
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:31,300
Anyway, it was just a terrible ruckus.

502
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:37,100
So, well, no one noticed when my mother went
across the street to give the neighbors a gift.

503
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:40,600
And the next thing we heard
were brakes screeching.

504
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:44,500
Wow.

505
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:49,600
Most of my family went to the hospital, but
I stayed home because I was so young.

506
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,500
When I looked out the window,

507
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:55,500
I saw all of my mother's blood on the street,

508
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:59,800
and nobody was doing anything
about it, so I got a hose,

509
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,600
and I washed it off,

510
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,800
and once it was clean, I felt so much better.

511
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:12,600
I never told anyone that story before.

512
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,900
Those are the most interesting ones --

513
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:17,500
the stories that we never tell anyone.

514
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:19,600
Yeah, you're probably right.

515
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,000
I have one.

516
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:24,700
It's more of a secret, really.

517
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:30,100
I know why my mom killed herself.

518
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,800
You do?

519
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:34,000
It was something I did --

520
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,300
something bad.

521
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:43,200
What did you do, Zach?

522
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,400
Zach, sweetheart.

523
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,400
No. I should -- I-I'd better not.

524
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,600
I shouldn't have said anything.

525
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,300
I shouldn't -- I shouldn't have done this.

526
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,400
I'm sorry. If my dad found out --

527
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,600
I won't tell your father.
I promise.

528
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,000
I-I can't get you in trouble.

529
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,900
Zachary, it's all right.

530
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,200
I can't believe Zach said that.

531
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,600
What else did he tell you?

532
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,700
That was it.

533
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:08,000
Just that Mary Alice killed herself because of
something that he had done.

534
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
You couldn't get any more out of him?

535
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,100
Well, I tried, but he was so nervous.

536
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:13,600
He actually started shaking, and then he just left.

537
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,200
Okay, this is getting really weird.

538
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,500
I think we should go to the police.

539
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,900
And tell them what? We don't
even have the note anymore.

540
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:20,100
We gave it to Paul.

541
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:23,200
Then you're going to have to get Zach to tell
you something so we have more to go on.

542
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,600
Girls, you don't understand.

543
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:27,000
This poor kid is scared out of his mind.

544
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,100
Oh, for god's sakes, Bree, you're a woman.

545
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:30,500
Manipulate him. That's what we do.

546
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:31,800
But how?

547
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:34,800
I don't know. How did you usually manipulate Rex?

548
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:40,700
Hello, Zachary.

549
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:43,000
Are you free for dinner tonight?

550
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Sure.

551
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Oh, good, because last night, you put
me in such a holiday mood,

552
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,800
so I'm going to make roast turkey
and candied yams and eggnog.

553
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:56,000
Have you ever had real old-fashioned eggnog?

554
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,600
No, I don't think so.

555
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,600
Oh, you are going to love it.

556
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,800
It has quite a kick.

557
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:05,000
- Oh, me!
- Score!

558
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,600
Boys, could you just not --

559
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,600
Get off me!

560
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,700
Get off me.
I'm serious.

561
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:18,900
Mom!

562
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:21,200
Mom! He's hitting me!

563
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,300
No, I'm not.

564
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:23,100
Mom!

565
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,400
Mom!

566
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,200
Gabrielle, please.

567
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,200
You bought me enough things.

568
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,900
You're the one that's supposed to be shopping.

569
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:32,500
Oh, mama, you're in a rut.

570
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:34,100
We need to spice up your wardrobe.

571
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:35,400
Ooh, here.

572
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:38,800
Try this one on. Go on, try it on.

573
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:44,500
Mama Solis, how you doing in there?

574
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:46,800
Is it supposed to be so tight?

575
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:49,400
Yes, it's form-fitting. You're going to look great.

576
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,700
Gabrielle, I don't think this dress is right for me.

577
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:54,000
I can't breathe.

578
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,200
Well, maybe I made a mistake.

579
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:02,200
While you change, I'm going to make
a quick run to the bookstore.

580
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,600
Gabrielle, wait, wait. I'm coming with you.

581
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,300
No, no, no. I'd just be a minute.

582
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:08,500
Wait, wait, Gabrielle, I'm coming with you -- ay!

583
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:16,400
Wait!

584
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,100
Gabrielle, wait!

585
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:22,800
Ma'am?

586
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:25,100
Ma'am, sorry.

587
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:27,500
I'm going to need to look in your bags, please.

588
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:29,300
Fine. Just hurry up.

589
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,200
Right on time.

590
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:40,200
I'm telling you, I don't know
where that blouse came from.

591
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,400
Security?

592
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,400
All right, keep your stupid blouse.

593
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,300
I'm going to have to find my daughter-in-law.

594
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:46,200
Don't touch me.

595
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,200
Don't you dare touch me!

596
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,800
Ma'am, you're going to have to come with us.

597
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:50,500
Get your hands off me!

598
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:52,300
Gabrielle!

599
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,800
Hello.

600
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:04,600
Hey, it's me.

601
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:06,900
Oh, hi, Rex. How are you?

602
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:07,900
Is something wrong?

603
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:11,200
Well, I was just about to grab dinner
from the motel vending machine,

604
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,600
and it occurred to me, what the heck? I'll go out.

605
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:17,300
Would you like to have dinner with me?

606
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,600
Mrs. Van de Kamp.

607
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:27,100
Guess what --
I found all my mom's old Christmas stuff.

608
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:28,700
Oh.

609
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:30,700
Sweetie, I was just coming over to talk to you.

610
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:35,000
I am so sorry, but something really important
came up, and I have to cancel.

611
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,700
Really?

612
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:38,100
We will do it again.

613
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:42,600
We'll have our impromptu holiday dinner, I promise.

614
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,200
Bye.

615
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:53,900
Mm, I got one -- Kelly Halsteder.

616
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:57,200
In eighth grade, she used to spit in my gym shoes.

617
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,200
Kelly halsteder.

618
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:01,800
Kelly halsteder.

619
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,000
There, look.

620
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:07,100
Two DUIs, one check kiting,
and an open bench warrant.

621
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:10,000
How tragic, by which I mean yay.

622
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:13,100
Yeah, you've been a really good sport,
coming along on my shift with me.

623
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:16,400
Well, time flies when you're
on a stakeout in crack town.

624
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,800
So when does our official date begin?

625
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:23,700
Well, the taxpayers say 20 minutes, but I say now.

626
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:27,000
They're down.

627
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,700
Oh, thank you.

628
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:32,400
Honey, you -- did you read up on homeschooling?

629
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:36,300
Yeah. Gave me some good ideas -- well, one, anyway.

630
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,200
Great. What -- what have you got?

631
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:41,500
Well, you know how we both agree
that one of us needs to stay home

632
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:45,900
and parent the kids and one of us needs
to go off and make a living.

633
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:50,500
And then I suddenly remembered that when
I was working, I made a little more than you.

634
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:52,700
W-what are you doing?

635
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:56,400
You tossed out that little sacrifice
comment a while ago,

636
00:31:56,400 --> 00:32:00,100
and it occurred to me I've made sacrifices
over the past six years.

637
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:01,900
I gave up my career.

638
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:04,300
If another sacrifice has to be made,

639
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:06,300
I think it's your turn on the merry-go-round.

640
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:07,000
L-lynette --

641
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,800
so if I wentack to work, then you could
stay home and take care of the kids.

642
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:14,200
I-I can't be with the kids all day.
I'd -- I'd lose my mind.

643
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,500
Aha.

644
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:16,400
Hey, okay, I get it.

645
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,800
Hey -- homeschooling is out.
Out.

646
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:23,500
But how are we going to scrape together
15 grand for this endowment?

647
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:24,600
Mm.

648
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,700
How, how, how?

649
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:29,300
Lynette was desperate to avoid homeschooling,

650
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:32,381
but she saw no options on the horizon

651
00:32:32,381 --> 00:32:35,300
until a solution sailed into view.

652
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:36,300
Oh, no.

653
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:38,600
Aye-aye.

654
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:42,100
So the restaurant's run by this
little old guy named Daranello.

655
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:43,300
He will propose to you.

656
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:45,900
Don't say yes, because he's dead serious.

657
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:48,500
But what if I like him?

658
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:51,600
Hey.

659
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:54,800
I thought this went to the lab.

660
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:57,900
All right.

661
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:59,500
You got me.

662
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:00,800
And that means what?

663
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:06,100
Look, Susan, no one would authorize lab time
or a computer search for a case like this.

664
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,800
It's -- it's just not a priority.

665
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,700
So why couldn't you just tell me that?

666
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:12,700
Well, I thought we were clicking?

667
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,300
Does this need to be a big deal?

668
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:17,900
Well, if you'd only lied to me
about it once, it wouldn't be.

669
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:20,900
All right, I get it. You want me to beg.

670
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:24,500
Okay, look at me. I'm begging. Beg.

671
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:27,900
Come on. Don't be such a girl about this.

672
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:30,900
I know who you are.

673
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:34,600
You're a Carl in disguise.

674
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,000
I'm done with you --

675
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,200
all of you.

676
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,300
Oh, come on, drama queen.

677
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:42,000
What are you doing?

678
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Where are you going? It's not safe.

679
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,400
I'd rather take my chances on the street,
thank you very much.

680
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:50,900
Oh, why do I always pick the psychos?

681
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,500
Excuse me.

682
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:09,400
I'm a little lost.

683
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,800
Oh, you best be lost. This here's my corner.

684
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:15,200
Oh, uh, yes, and -- and a lovely corner it is,

685
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:18,000
and I hate to bother you while you're...working.

686
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,300
I just was wondering if you could point me
in the direction of a pay phone.

687
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:27,200
Oh, and if you had some change, uh,
for this $5, preferably quarters...

688
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:30,500
Honey, if I got paid in quarters, I'd be
doing something very wrong.

689
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:32,200
Right.

690
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:34,200
Okay.

691
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:36,500
Thank you.

692
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:38,800
Hey.

693
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,500
You want to use my cell?

694
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:41,800
I have weekend minutes.

695
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,200
Oh, thank you so much.

696
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,400
You're saving my life.

697
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,300
Oh, excuse me, honey.

698
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:49,600
Oh, yes, you -- you do what you've got to do.

699
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:58,500
Oh, please answer. Come on, pick up, Julie.

700
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:01,200
Oh, thank god.
Okay, don't ask any questions.

701
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:06,000
Just get somebody down here to pick me up
at the corner of Ninth and Foster.

702
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,300
Hey, babe.

703
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:09,800
Thank you, no. I'm on a break.

704
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:12,200
Hurry, please.

705
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,100
Excuse me.

706
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,600
We got a call. Something about a break-in.

707
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:21,000
One of your neighbors reported seeing
someone forcing his way into your home.

708
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,300
We sent some guys out to investigate, and, uh...

709
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:25,600
w-what is it?

710
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:26,800
I got to tell you, ma'am,

711
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:30,300
I thought I'd seen a lot on the job,
but this is something else.

712
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,500
So let me get this straight.

713
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:03,400
He chopped down one of our pine trees?

714
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,900
I'm afraid so.

715
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:12,700
Zach, why did you do this?

716
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:14,200
I don't know.

717
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,100
Take off those handcuffs, please.

718
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:18,800
Ma'am, he confessed to breaking in.

719
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,100
This is not up for discussion.

720
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,700
good

721
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,500
Sir, you can't --

722
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:29,700
Zach.

723
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:47,600
You okay?

724
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:48,800
Yeah.

725
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:52,100
Then how much for a trip around the world?

726
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:54,200
I cannot believe Julie sent you.

727
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,600
She is soon going to be dead.

728
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,400
Come on. Get in.

729
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,700
Wasn't that sent in for prints?

730
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:06,600
No, the cop lied to me.

731
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:08,200
I don't want to talk about it.

732
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,700
Just asking.

733
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:16,200
Yes, apparently, they found a blouse in her bag.

734
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:20,900
Oh, I don't know, Carlos. At some point,
older people start to get confused.

735
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:23,000
She probably thought she paid for it.

736
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,500
No, no charges.

737
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:26,800
Everything's fine.

738
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,500
Okay, I'll tell her. Bye.

739
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:35,700
Mama Solis, Carlos is going to be late for dinner.
It's just the two of us.

740
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:36,700
What would you like to eat?

741
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:39,100
Oh, I'm not hungry.

742
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:41,200
Okay, suit yourself.

743
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,800
Don't go yet.

744
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,900
I need to talk to you.

745
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:50,900
It's important. Please.

746
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:58,400
I married Diego Solis when I was 16 years old.

747
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:03,200
A few months into our marriage,
he started to beat me.

748
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:06,500
I was so young and stupid, I didn't know what to do.

749
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:08,400
Juanita, I had no idea.

750
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:13,000
It got so bad that I started praying
to god to let me die,

751
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:17,900
but god, in his infinite wisdom,
gave me a reason to live.

752
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:20,200
Carlos.

753
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:22,800
Ah, he was a beautiful baby.

754
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,800
But my husband wasn't much of a father.

755
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,400
He never held him.

756
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,400
He would yell and scream at him for no reason at all.

757
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:35,100
One night when Carlos was 4,
Diego Solis came home drunk,

758
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:38,200
and he beat my Carlos.

759
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,900
Something inside me snapped,

760
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:42,900
and at that moment,

761
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:45,300
I found a way to be strong,

762
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:53,800
so I made sure that Diego Solis never hurt
my son or me ever again.

763
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,900
W-what'd you do?

764
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:58,400
Well, if you pray hard enough,

765
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:01,600
god gives you the tools to your salvation.

766
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,600
Carlos said that his father
left for a waitress in El Paso.

767
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:16,200
Mm-hmm. That's what he was told.

768
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,100
All mothers know they have to protect their children,

769
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:24,700
but some of us take our job
more seriously than others.

770
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,100
I don't know why you're telling me this.

771
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,900
I think you do.

772
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,300
Look, okay, I know you're mad at me,

773
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:54,300
and I'm sorry I didn't stop you
from going out with that guy.

774
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:55,300
I'm not mad at you.

775
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:57,000
I mean, I'm not just mad at you.

776
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,700
I'm mostly mad at myself.

777
00:39:58,700 --> 00:39:59,800
Okay.

778
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:04,400
I'm mad that I like you so much without
really knowing anything about you.

779
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,000
Oh.

780
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:08,900
What do you want to know?

781
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,200
What's your favorite food?

782
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,500
Mexican.

783
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:14,600
What's your favorite sport?

784
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:15,300
Football.

785
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:16,400
Favorite band?

786
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,500
Elvis Costello.

787
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:19,100
That's a guy, not a band.

788
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:21,300
It's a guy with a band.

789
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,300
What do you think of me?

790
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,900
I'm sorry. Could you repeat that?

791
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:57,300
Why?

792
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:58,100
I don't want to talk about it.

793
00:40:58,100 --> 00:40:59,800
Do you realize how insane this looks?

794
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,200
Do you even care about me at all?!

795
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,800
Did you even care about mom?!

796
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:03,400
You will not talk to me that way.

797
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,800
I think I just did.

798
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,000
Ow!

799
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:15,000
Mrs. Van de Kamp.

800
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,600
Hi, Zach. I just, uh, wanted to see
if everything was all right.

801
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:20,200
Everything's fine.

802
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,500
Are you sure?

803
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:22,800
Yes.

804
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:26,500
Well, okay.

805
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:28,600
I'll see you tomorrow, then.

806
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:30,300
I'm sure that you will.

807
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:47,300
People, by their very nature, are always
on the lookout for intruders.

808
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:48,600
What the --

809
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:53,200
trying to prevent those on the outside from getting in.

810
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:59,300
But there will always be those who force
their way into our lives,

811
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:02,900
just as there will be those we invite in.

812
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:04,000
Hi.

813
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,300
But the most troubling of all

814
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:24,100
will be the ones who stand
on the outside looking in...

815
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,500
the ones we never truly

816
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:30,000
get to know.
