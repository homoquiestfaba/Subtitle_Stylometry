1
00:00:08,216 --> 00:00:14,597
<i>Egypt. Temples and pyramids
recall the pharaoh's will-</i>

2
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:19,268
<i>- the brilliance of his architects
and the toil of his subjects.</i>

3
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:53,177
<i>It was a time when anything
could happen, and it did.</i>

4
00:00:53,261 --> 00:00:56,681
<i>It was the age of
gods and demigods.</i>

5
00:00:56,764 --> 00:01:00,893
<i>It was a time of death.</i>

6
00:01:31,132 --> 00:01:34,051
<i>The valley was once green and fertile-</i>

7
00:01:34,135 --> 00:01:39,932
<i>- but that was before
Im-La-Ra, Set's left hand, arrived.</i>

8
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:43,352
<i>With him came chaos.</i>

9
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:06,417
<i>It was also a time when man tried
to seek help from higher powers.</i>

10
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:07,895
<i>But Pharaoh's priests eventually learned
to defend themselves against the beast.</i>

11
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:23,452
<i>Whoever had Ra's
amulet must protect it…</i>

12
00:03:30,459 --> 00:03:33,504
<i>...and strike at the heart of evil.</i>

13
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:39,677
<i>The demigod was not omnipotent.
He too was under Ra's rules.</i>

14
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:44,348
<i>There are always men
who prefer power to honor.</i>

15
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:49,270
<i>And Im-La-Ra used those men.</i>

16
00:03:49,353 --> 00:03:53,900
<i>He tormented their bodies
as well as their souls.</i>

17
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:43,616
<i>The people sent their fiery
arrows under the light of the sun.</i>

18
00:04:44,742 --> 00:04:48,955
<i>The beast was caught.</i>

19
00:04:50,414 --> 00:04:55,670
<i>The small but mighty
amulet of Ra was blessed.</i>

20
00:04:55,753 --> 00:05:02,301
<i>It protected them in the
ritual, but it must be buried.</i>

21
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:05,555
<i>When the amulet disappeared-</i>

22
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:09,559
<i>-so did Im-La-Ra.</i>

24
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:48,282
PRESENT

25
00:07:02,338 --> 00:07:07,635
- Forgive me for being late.
- You didn't miss anything.

26
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:15,977
- I have your stuff.
- Good. Then we'll go.

27
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:35,454
Do you really want to get
rid of your entire collection?

28
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:39,709
Much of the best is not found.
We'll do it next time.

29
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:43,921
We've already
searched a dozen times.

30
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:47,550
Three dozen!

31
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:53,431
I've been standing in the sand for two
years, and now you want to go to the beach.

32
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:57,310
- Now you are an expert.
- On what?

33
00:07:57,393 --> 00:08:01,314
Finding things
buried in the sand.

34
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:06,819
But everything I find in the
sand turns out to be dangerous.

35
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:13,075
Mark, why don't you
ever talk about Iraq?

36
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:20,541
It just is.

37
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:26,923
A lot happened there
that you want to forget.

38
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:29,800
Things that change you.

39
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:35,223
- That's why I don't talk about it.
- Shall we drive, C.B.?

40
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:41,812
Very few got to call him that.
Maybe the recording director.

41
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:46,442
The producer, the big
stars, the photographer...

42
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:52,740
Everyone else called him Mr. DeMille.

43
00:08:52,823 --> 00:08:59,372
Otherwise, you had to work
with western films at Republic.

44
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:04,794
With a manure shovel in one
hand and a bucket in the other.

45
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:07,880
They called it horse hockey.

46
00:09:09,841 --> 00:09:13,052
One of my favorite anecdotes, Grandpa.

47
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:18,015
- Are you ready, Mr. DeMille?
- Absolutely, C.B.

48
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:24,564
How do you get this going?

49
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:30,152
- No...
- Give it to me.

50
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:35,157
I don't want to watch sports.
It's boring.

51
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:38,995
<i>Time has stood still
in DeMille's Lost City.</i>

52
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:44,959
<i>The filming location is to be
excavated by Dr. Alice Carter-</i>

53
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:49,046
<i>- who is married to
archaeologist Jesse Carter.</i>

54
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:53,718
<i>Carter will excavate
and preserve this sight.</i>

55
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:56,679
Is that your wife?

56
00:09:56,762 --> 00:10:02,768
- Are you married? How stupid I am.
- We are about to separate.

57
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:06,522
- You lied!
- I'm just going to sign the papers.

58
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:11,986
I am dropping your course. If
you fail me, I'll go to the dean.

59
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:16,115
You are overreacting.

60
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:28,669
No, Alice, I'm the one
exploiting the media.

61
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:35,009
EXCAVATION
GUADALUPE IN CALIFORNIA

62
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:41,516
Here is the box. Jamie!

63
00:10:46,938 --> 00:10:49,232
Jamie!

64
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:15,424
- Hang up...
- Where's Meagan with the box?

65
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:24,767
Jamie, will you marry me?

66
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:28,729
I think it's over by the water.

67
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:33,776
It looks good. Photograph and pack them-

68
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:38,447
- then we will load them
on the truck tomorrow.

69
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:46,706
Oh no... The old man is back.

70
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:50,209
He has some action hero with him.

71
00:11:50,293 --> 00:11:54,422
He is sexy.
Don't forget you are single.

72
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:07,685
I can't have two newbies digging.
The students are bad enough.

73
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:11,105
But you haven't
found the good stuff.

74
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:21,616
- Sorry, what did you say?
- The throne room, the pharaoh's gate...

75
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:26,162
- It's still buried.
- How do you know that?

76
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:31,334
I have said that I
was here as a child.

77
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:37,590
- Where is it, then?
- Let Mark and I look...

78
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:41,135
...then you'll get the good stuff.

79
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:46,849
He's the only one who still knows.
What do you say, Dr. Carter?

80
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:50,561
- Say Alice.
- Okay, Alice.

81
00:12:50,645 --> 00:12:53,856
We promise not to
destroy any relics.

82
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:57,944
- It's not a real excavation.
- You're not a real student.

83
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:02,740
- It is nice to work with you.
- Stop whining!

84
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:06,911
Show where you intend to look.

85
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:38,901
Shall we settle for today?

86
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:43,865
Give me ten more minutes.

87
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:49,620
This is where we've
looked the least so far.

88
00:13:49,704 --> 00:13:54,584
- I promise we are close now.
- That sounds familiar.

89
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:59,297
That's what you said when I
dug up the license plate too.

90
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:03,134
- Are you in a hurry somewhere?
- No...

91
00:14:05,136 --> 00:14:11,559
Now show some backbone.
Just give me ten more minutes.

92
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:16,022
Are you sure you didn't just dream
that you buried it in the desert?

93
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:20,193
That kind of talk is…

94
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:35,750
Perfect... I guess I'll have
to dig up another hubcap.

95
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:43,132
Could you please come?
The hole does not dig itself.

96
00:14:57,605 --> 00:15:02,109
I told you it was here.

97
00:15:02,193 --> 00:15:07,907
For 19 years, 3 months and 4
days I've been looking for that-

98
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:12,119
-and it has been buried for 80 years.

99
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:17,333
The best memories of
my life are in that box.

100
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:34,475
Are you going to open it?

101
00:15:57,748 --> 00:16:00,793
It's incredible.

102
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:07,008
Grandfather!

103
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:33,993
Get me out of here!

104
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:42,335
Fast!

105
00:16:55,223 --> 00:16:57,808
Help!

106
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:06,150
- Call an ambulance!
- The stories are true...

107
00:17:06,234 --> 00:17:10,071
The doctor is on his way. Stay with me.

108
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:13,241
Reverse!

109
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:21,874
Where is the rest of me?

110
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:26,212
Ronald Reagan said it
in the movie "King's Row".

111
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:30,466
He looked for his leg.

112
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:33,302
Get an ambulance here!

113
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:40,142
One two three four five.

114
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:42,979
One two three four five.

115
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:47,817
Grandfather, stay with me!
One two three four five.

116
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:52,113
Come on now!

117
00:18:35,323 --> 00:18:38,284
You couldn't have done anything.

118
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:42,830
His heart could not
handle the strain.

119
00:18:42,914 --> 00:18:46,125
Do you know what might
have happened to the arm?

120
00:18:46,209 --> 00:18:50,505
No.
We found some boards with nails in them.

121
00:18:50,588 --> 00:18:56,135
They belong to the filming.
Maybe he got stuck on one.

122
00:18:56,219 --> 00:19:01,849
- Can you tear the arm off on a nail?
- I said maybe.

123
00:19:01,933 --> 00:19:05,269
It's obviously an accident.

124
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:12,944
Our movie star governor
wants us to be cooperative.

125
00:19:13,027 --> 00:19:17,114
Hollywood is interested
in what you do here.

126
00:19:17,198 --> 00:19:24,622
So I won't close the dig,
but don't let in any newbies.

127
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:27,458
- Okay?
- Obvious. Thanks.

128
00:19:34,757 --> 00:19:39,637
I found this one.
It probably belongs to you now.

129
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,557
I am really sorry.

130
00:19:45,852 --> 00:19:50,273
My grandfather was
really obsessed with this.

131
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:55,152
DeMille's Lost City was the
only thing he talked about.

132
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:03,327
When I got home from Iraq,
he kept talking about it as usual.

133
00:20:03,411 --> 00:20:07,373
- Were you in Iraq?
- For two years.

134
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:13,129
I've seen people disappear
into the sand before.

135
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:16,257
But this was unnatural.

136
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:22,263
- I shouldn't have let you dig.
- It wasn't your fault, Dr. Carter...

137
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:25,266
Sorry - Alice.

138
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:31,063
- We had dug even without permission.
- It feels safe to hear...

139
00:20:32,607 --> 00:20:39,071
Surely it is beautiful?
It should protect against evil spirits.

140
00:20:39,155 --> 00:20:42,533
It doesn't seem to work right away.

141
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:49,832
I don't suppose so.

142
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:59,842
I heard the water
is coming here soon.

143
00:20:59,926 --> 00:21:03,846
I have two weeks to move
things before they disappear.

144
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:10,561
The oil companies have built a canal
so that the ships can reach the refineries.

145
00:21:10,645 --> 00:21:15,733
Are you moving an entire
location in less than two weeks?

146
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:21,697
- I had hoped to be able to do it.
- I'm used to that sort of thing.

147
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:27,578
- What do you mean?
- I was a logistician in Iraq.

148
00:21:27,662 --> 00:21:32,792
I made sure that soldiers and
equipment arrived in time for the battles.

149
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:38,339
- Do you want a job?
- As a truck driver?

150
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:42,510
I need a coordinator.

151
00:21:42,593 --> 00:21:46,264
I do not know...

152
00:21:46,347 --> 00:21:52,770
I need someone with your background
to move everything. Are you interested?

153
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,864
This meant everything to my grandfather.

154
00:22:02,947 --> 00:22:09,287
And I intend to find out what
happened to him, so yes, I want to.

155
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:13,416
When do we start?

156
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:16,043
I guess you want to go to…

157
00:22:16,127 --> 00:22:20,590
- Hello, Mrs. Carter.
- Jesse, what are you doing here?

158
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:23,676
Am I Disturbing?

159
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:28,014
- No, I was still on my way.
- You don't have to go.

160
00:22:28,097 --> 00:22:32,435
I thought to clear my mind anyway.

161
00:22:32,518 --> 00:22:35,646
Be careful.

162
00:22:37,648 --> 00:22:44,363
- A new friend?
- His grandfather just died here.

163
00:22:44,447 --> 00:22:48,284
- Sorry, I didn't know that.
- It is okay.

164
00:22:52,663 --> 00:22:55,875
What are you doing here?

165
00:22:55,958 --> 00:22:59,295
Do you do something like this
without calling your spouse?

166
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:02,548
Former husband.

167
00:23:02,632 --> 00:23:10,014
- I haven't signed the papers.
- I don't have time with you anymore.

168
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:15,269
I need you. I can't just throw
four years of my life away.

169
00:23:15,353 --> 00:23:21,567
You just need an assistant.
You hate that we are equals now.

170
00:23:21,651 --> 00:23:27,240
What I did was wrong. But I don't
want to just throw my marriage away.

171
00:23:27,323 --> 00:23:32,245
It's not your
marriage, it's ours.

172
00:23:32,328 --> 00:23:36,290
You have no place for me in your life.
I must go.

173
00:23:36,374 --> 00:23:40,962
I came to help you move
"The Ten Commandments".

174
00:23:41,045 --> 00:23:44,674
- I don't need your help.
- You're still angry.

175
00:23:44,757 --> 00:23:48,845
I have heard of the water.

176
00:23:48,928 --> 00:23:52,014
- You can't handle it.
- Do not worry.

177
00:23:52,098 --> 00:23:57,687
I just want to help. I know a lot
about "The Ten Commandments".

178
00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:03,693
- Yes, especially the one about infidelity.
- <i> Touché.</i>

179
00:24:07,655 --> 00:24:12,451
Dr. Carter, you have no
idea what we've found!

180
00:24:22,003 --> 00:24:25,631
It's much bigger than I thought.

181
00:24:54,744 --> 00:24:57,246
Grandpa was right.

182
00:24:58,956 --> 00:25:05,796
- I dug in the wrong place.
- Now you need all the help you can get.

183
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:10,510
Doc? This looks real.

184
00:25:12,595 --> 00:25:16,265
- What do you mean?
- This face...

185
00:25:16,349 --> 00:25:22,146
- ...appears to be from the Middle Kingdom.
- I want to check.

186
00:25:24,982 --> 00:25:27,652
I hate you!

187
00:25:48,381 --> 00:25:51,050
What the hell...?

188
00:26:06,566 --> 00:26:08,484
Tommy!

189
00:26:16,158 --> 00:26:20,204
Stay!

190
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:23,291
- Oh my God!
- Tommy!

191
00:27:01,287 --> 00:27:07,793
It's terrible, but if we stop
for a day, we won't have time.

192
00:27:07,877 --> 00:27:14,091
Stop for today.
I already have too few people.

193
00:27:14,175 --> 00:27:17,595
I'll send a constable
tomorrow morning.

194
00:27:17,678 --> 00:27:22,975
You can probably continue
working at lunchtime - if it's safe.

195
00:27:23,059 --> 00:27:26,020
Certainly. Thanks.

196
00:27:36,197 --> 00:27:42,870
I didn't say anything in front of the
sheriff, but I got a strange feeling.

197
00:27:42,954 --> 00:27:47,750
It hasn't happened since
we patrolled outside Samara.

198
00:27:47,834 --> 00:27:51,671
It's just a mixture
of wood and plaster.

199
00:27:51,754 --> 00:27:55,633
And three people
have died in two days.

200
00:27:55,716 --> 00:27:59,220
What are the odds
that it's a coincidence?

201
00:28:36,841 --> 00:28:40,511
- I hate this.
- What?

202
00:28:40,595 --> 00:28:45,266
We shouldn't be here
considering what happened…

203
00:28:45,349 --> 00:28:49,520
...Tommy and the others.

204
00:28:50,479 --> 00:28:54,025
I think Carter is right.

205
00:28:54,108 --> 00:28:58,654
If we focus on the job,
we'll get through this.

206
00:28:58,738 --> 00:29:01,657
I guess so.

207
00:29:01,741 --> 00:29:07,330
I just got a weird feeling that I
haven't been able to get rid of.

208
00:29:07,413 --> 00:29:10,333
Meagan...

209
00:29:11,918 --> 00:29:17,215
When I'm done with this round,
we'll be done for tonight. Okay?

210
00:29:40,154 --> 00:29:43,074
Hello, little shard.

211
00:29:43,157 --> 00:29:47,411
People have died to
get you off the ground.

212
00:29:47,495 --> 00:29:50,581
We'll see what you have to say.

213
00:29:52,667 --> 00:29:55,962
Item 312.

214
00:29:56,045 --> 00:30:01,801
Part of one of the 21 sphinxes
along the road to Ramses' Gate.

215
00:30:01,884 --> 00:30:08,850
The plaster is the same as
the standard used in the 1920s.

216
00:30:08,933 --> 00:30:15,189
The object has suffered only
minor erosion and minimal abrasion.

217
00:31:12,163 --> 00:31:15,791
Have you heard from Jamie? Keep calling.

218
00:31:18,252 --> 00:31:22,131
Jimmy will be here in a little while.

219
00:31:23,883 --> 00:31:28,679
Nine of your students rush
all the artifacts to location B.

220
00:31:28,763 --> 00:31:32,475
We have two trucks running.

221
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:37,313
- What do we do now?
- Removes the sand from the entrance.

222
00:31:37,396 --> 00:31:44,487
I was joking. I will measure
our position using the mountains.

223
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:50,868
I have already measured. Give me a
topographical map and we'll be home.

224
00:31:50,952 --> 00:31:55,331
It is a bit more complicated in archaeology.
- Right?

225
00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:58,751
You have saved us
half a working day.

226
00:32:00,795 --> 00:32:04,757
Don't worry - I know
how dunes work.

227
00:32:04,841 --> 00:32:11,597
I have dug up countless bunkers.
I have become an expert at it.

228
00:32:14,851 --> 00:32:18,604
We are through.
Do you feel the cold air?

229
00:32:32,034 --> 00:32:38,624
- We must preserve the place.
- Now it's just easier to ship.

230
00:32:38,708 --> 00:32:42,795
- I'll take it carefully.
- Where did you study?

231
00:32:42,879 --> 00:32:45,923
Fort Riley in Kansas.

232
00:32:47,049 --> 00:32:50,094
Next time maybe you can take pictures?

233
00:32:50,178 --> 00:32:53,181
Can you guys stop arguing?

234
00:33:02,523 --> 00:33:07,778
- Here we have it.
- Everything looks so authentic.

235
00:33:07,862 --> 00:33:11,157
I understand that people are fooled.

236
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:15,369
It's hard to believe
it's made in Hollywood.

237
00:33:15,453 --> 00:33:20,374
- You don't think DeMille...
- ...picked it up in Cairo, do you?

238
00:33:20,458 --> 00:33:25,838
I do not know.
He was a wealthy cosmopolitan.

239
00:33:25,922 --> 00:33:29,300
He traveled around and found items.

240
00:33:29,383 --> 00:33:32,678
Hearst Castle
is full of antiques.

241
00:33:32,762 --> 00:33:36,432
- Like "Citizen Kane".
- I've never seen it.

242
00:33:36,516 --> 00:33:42,021
- Rosebud is the sledge.
- Where did they get all this?

243
00:33:42,104 --> 00:33:45,983
Well, what did your great
grandfather do for Cecil B. DeMille?

244
00:33:46,067 --> 00:33:49,195
He was a producer.

245
00:33:49,278 --> 00:33:53,032
And so he led expeditions
around the world.

246
00:33:53,115 --> 00:33:57,703
We would never have
found this if you hadn't come.

247
00:33:57,787 --> 00:34:01,541
We will probably need the snorkels anyway.

248
00:34:01,624 --> 00:34:07,588
- Not if we hurry.
- If there are many of us, it will be done in a week.

249
00:34:41,289 --> 00:34:44,375
Alice, did you do well?

250
00:34:44,458 --> 00:34:47,753
- Did you see it?
- No.

251
00:34:47,837 --> 00:34:53,926
Just the floor coming at me.
Whatever it was, it was already here.

252
00:34:54,010 --> 00:34:58,139
What are you talking about?
There is only one way in.

253
00:34:59,265 --> 00:35:02,602
<i>Help!</i>

254
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:15,656
- What happened?
- I saw it.

255
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:19,702
It had a face like a dog.

256
00:35:19,785 --> 00:35:23,122
- It swirled around Meagan.
- What then "face"?

257
00:35:23,206 --> 00:35:29,337
A cloud of sand came out of the opening,
and the head resembled a Doberman.

258
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:33,883
I heard whispers, and
then it disappeared.

259
00:35:33,966 --> 00:35:38,721
My arm felt like it was on fire.

260
00:35:41,224 --> 00:35:43,893
No problem.

261
00:35:59,283 --> 00:36:02,787
- I don't get it.
- What?

262
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:09,252
The hieroglyphs.
They are not right. It's like a riddle.

263
00:36:09,335 --> 00:36:16,926
- Look at the angles.
- They probably found it on a postcard.

264
00:36:17,009 --> 00:36:22,348
It's weird.
The walls look incredibly authentic.

265
00:36:22,431 --> 00:36:27,186
But they completely lack logic.

266
00:36:31,732 --> 00:36:35,611
Well, Jesse, there is.

267
00:36:35,695 --> 00:36:40,533
It is written as a code.
Can you read backwards?

268
00:36:44,036 --> 00:36:46,747
Now I see it.

269
00:36:46,831 --> 00:36:52,295
I've seen this sort of thing before in
occult texts from the Middle Kingdom.

270
00:36:53,754 --> 00:36:57,758
It's like a spell.

271
00:36:59,302 --> 00:37:02,597
This chamber has
a different purpose.

272
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:05,016
How?

273
00:37:06,267 --> 00:37:10,730
This refers to an avenger.

274
00:37:11,939 --> 00:37:16,027
Here it says to tie-

275
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:19,655
-or maybe get tied up.

276
00:37:19,739 --> 00:37:23,284
- What are you talking about?
- This room...

277
00:37:23,367 --> 00:37:27,246
...was built to hold something inside.

278
00:37:27,330 --> 00:37:32,960
So my grandfather fell into a
trap for some kind of ghost?

279
00:37:33,044 --> 00:37:38,132
If you believe in this sort of thing, something
has been trapped here for a long time.

280
00:37:38,216 --> 00:37:43,387
But why do they lock something up
here with a big warning sign outside?

281
00:37:43,471 --> 00:37:46,682
It basically said,
"Stay away, or else..."

282
00:37:46,766 --> 00:37:49,268
What?

283
00:37:49,352 --> 00:37:52,688
There is no literal translation.

284
00:37:52,772 --> 00:37:57,026
"...are you drowning in
the sands of oblivion."

285
00:37:57,109 --> 00:38:02,865
Don't we know an expert who
has written a book on the subject?

286
00:38:02,949 --> 00:38:05,743
He's already here.

287
00:38:05,826 --> 00:38:10,122
You are supposed to represent scientists,
but you are more like UFO hunters.

288
00:38:10,206 --> 00:38:15,127
When a statue jumps on
you, one's worldview changes.

289
00:38:15,211 --> 00:38:18,881
Good point.

290
00:38:22,093 --> 00:38:29,267
My grandfather used to tell stories
of people who had died during filming.

291
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:34,647
- What do you mean?
- To scare curious children.

292
00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:38,067
But now I don't know anymore.

293
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:40,987
- Scare?
- Yes...

294
00:38:42,071 --> 00:38:49,203
From what I remember, people
saw things that weren't really there.

295
00:38:49,287 --> 00:38:52,498
There were a lot of
strange fatal accidents.

296
00:38:52,582 --> 00:38:56,252
We've had a lot
of freak accidents.

297
00:39:01,424 --> 00:39:04,468
Jesse, what are you doing?

298
00:39:05,595 --> 00:39:09,307
We need to move this
as quickly as possible.

299
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:14,061
- What is it?
- This is not a stage.

300
00:39:14,145 --> 00:39:18,232
At least not now anymore.
It's a prison cell.

301
00:39:18,316 --> 00:39:21,527
And we just unlocked it.

302
00:39:49,805 --> 00:39:53,976
- Why did they choose this place?
- They didn't.

303
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:57,647
It was included in the project.

304
00:39:57,730 --> 00:40:04,195
The financier owns the
land and lets us use it.

305
00:40:05,530 --> 00:40:10,284
The idea was that we
would store everything here.

306
00:40:10,368 --> 00:40:15,748
It would serve as a rallying
point until we were done.

307
00:40:15,831 --> 00:40:20,086
Now Dr. Carter wants to
build everything up here.

308
00:40:32,056 --> 00:40:36,394
It's so remote.
But it is beautiful.

309
00:40:36,477 --> 00:40:42,692
Yes, but the humidity
seems to destroy the material.

310
00:40:42,775 --> 00:40:46,237
At least there won't
be a flood here.

311
00:40:48,698 --> 00:40:51,993
It's just weird…

312
00:40:52,076 --> 00:40:55,079
...that Jamie stuck like that.

313
00:40:55,162 --> 00:41:00,626
You don't think she stung, do you?
After what happened to Tommy and John?

314
00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:05,047
Look at your arm! Something killed her!

315
00:41:06,465 --> 00:41:09,802
Or took her or something.

316
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:18,186
Don't cry now.

317
00:41:20,229 --> 00:41:24,775
Sorry, Meagan.
It's just so scary.

318
00:41:27,028 --> 00:41:30,114
I know.

319
00:41:30,198 --> 00:41:32,992
Sorry.

320
00:41:34,869 --> 00:41:37,830
You are not alone in being afraid.

321
00:41:37,914 --> 00:41:40,958
We should have stopped digging when Tommy…

322
00:41:47,548 --> 00:41:51,552
I met his mother at
the hotel this morning.

323
00:41:51,636 --> 00:41:56,057
- She picked up his things.
- Tommy's mother?

324
00:41:56,140 --> 00:42:00,686
They take him to New
Jersey for the funeral.

325
00:42:00,770 --> 00:42:04,649
That sounds reasonable.

326
00:42:05,650 --> 00:42:09,570
They have come a long way now.
We'll be done soon.

327
00:42:14,450 --> 00:42:20,331
Now we go back
and help them load.

328
00:42:31,884 --> 00:42:35,888
- It's moving forward for you.
- So far.

329
00:42:35,972 --> 00:42:39,809
It's nice to have a big
and strong soldier with us.

330
00:42:41,644 --> 00:42:44,814
- I'm waiting in the car.
- Thanks, Jesse.

331
00:42:44,897 --> 00:42:48,818
- For what?
- Now I remember why I left you.

332
00:42:48,901 --> 00:42:53,823
I've read some of the
text, and it's not nice.

333
00:42:53,906 --> 00:42:59,287
It tells of a spirit that takes revenge
on those who raid the Pharaoh's tomb.

334
00:42:59,370 --> 00:43:03,916
- What is the name of this spirit?
- Im-La-Ra.

335
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,669
- Set's left hand.
- God of Chaos?

336
00:43:06,752 --> 00:43:12,091
He turns water into sand, crops
into dust, and life into death.

337
00:43:12,175 --> 00:43:17,680
- You look worried.
- If my translation is correct...

338
00:43:17,763 --> 00:43:25,062
...so we have released Egypt's
old plagues in the 21st century.

339
00:43:25,146 --> 00:43:30,234
Mark and I are checking the DeMille
archives. You stay and lead the work.

340
00:43:30,318 --> 00:43:34,405
- What do you want to find?
- There must be something in the archive.

341
00:43:34,488 --> 00:43:40,870
- Are you going to break in?
- Maybe. Don't you like adventure?

342
00:44:24,247 --> 00:44:28,543
LOCATION B SANTA
MARIA IN CALIFORNIA

343
00:44:40,930 --> 00:44:45,518
I've dumped a load at the beach.
Was it something else?

344
00:44:45,601 --> 00:44:48,646
No. See you tomorrow.

345
00:45:07,665 --> 00:45:11,169
Bye, Meg.

346
00:45:15,798 --> 00:45:20,011
Meagan? Is everything
good? What did you say?

347
00:46:47,723 --> 00:46:50,810
My car...

348
00:46:56,524 --> 00:47:00,444
Hello? Hello?

349
00:47:00,528 --> 00:47:03,406
Where are you?

350
00:47:03,489 --> 00:47:06,576
Sorry.

351
00:47:06,659 --> 00:47:10,288
You're not hurt, are you? Hello?

352
00:47:35,354 --> 00:47:39,525
Here we have it.
His sanctuary and studio.

353
00:47:39,609 --> 00:47:42,612
The archives have been
here for almost 40 years.

354
00:47:42,695 --> 00:47:46,032
Shall we kick in the door?

355
00:47:46,115 --> 00:47:50,161
We'll wait on that, Rambo.

356
00:47:50,244 --> 00:47:54,290
- We don't want to wake Nigel.
- Who is Nigel?

357
00:47:54,373 --> 00:47:59,045
I worked here for a while.

358
00:47:59,128 --> 00:48:03,007
- He showed where the key was.
- So practical.

359
00:48:21,776 --> 00:48:27,114
- What are you looking for?
- Specifications, invoices...

360
00:48:27,198 --> 00:48:33,037
All that can tell what they took
from Egypt and buried in the sand.

361
00:48:39,377 --> 00:48:43,881
- I wonder what it fetches on Ebay.
- Here we have something.

362
00:48:50,471 --> 00:48:55,560
Listen: "Brother Tristan
urges me to bury everything."

363
00:48:55,643 --> 00:49:00,648
"It's hidden in one of the items.
We can't risk anything."

364
00:49:00,731 --> 00:49:03,192
- "Cecil B. DeMille."
- To?

365
00:49:03,276 --> 00:49:08,364
Lionel Barrington. I've seen
this before but didn't get it.

366
00:49:08,447 --> 00:49:12,034
Here's more. They went to Cairo-

367
00:49:12,118 --> 00:49:16,080
- bought hundreds of artifacts
and shipped them here.

368
00:49:16,163 --> 00:49:20,960
- Your great-grandfather was there.
- Did he bring a mummy here?

369
00:49:21,043 --> 00:49:27,049
There was more to ancient
Egypt than mummies and pyramids.

370
00:49:27,133 --> 00:49:32,597
The old priests could
gain power over the spirits.

371
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:35,683
Good to hear.

372
00:49:38,394 --> 00:49:41,063
I didn't hit that hard.

373
00:49:41,147 --> 00:49:44,233
Did it go well?

374
00:49:45,902 --> 00:49:48,654
I'll probably survive unfortunately.

375
00:49:53,576 --> 00:49:56,120
You snuck in.

376
00:49:56,204 --> 00:50:00,666
Nigel Barrington,
former Air Force pilot.

377
00:50:00,750 --> 00:50:04,504
I was in "The Bridge
over the River Kwai".

378
00:50:04,587 --> 00:50:07,673
I learned a few tricks from them.

379
00:50:07,757 --> 00:50:10,760
I told you what we do here.

380
00:50:10,843 --> 00:50:16,224
It's still burglary.
You can be reported for this.

381
00:50:16,307 --> 00:50:19,685
I didn't want to wake you up.

382
00:50:19,769 --> 00:50:25,066
- This is Mark Tevis.
- I know who he is.

383
00:50:25,149 --> 00:50:30,988
Your grandfather and I were friends.
But it was a long time ago.

384
00:50:31,072 --> 00:50:34,992
Is it a real Maltese Falcon?

385
00:50:35,076 --> 00:50:37,745
It is a replica.

386
00:50:37,828 --> 00:50:40,456
Or?

387
00:50:41,832 --> 00:50:46,754
You must have read father's letter. You
want to know what we took from Egypt.

388
00:50:46,838 --> 00:50:50,508
- Were you there too?
- I was just a boy.

389
00:50:50,591 --> 00:50:53,302
Like your grandfather, Mr. Tevis.

390
00:50:53,386 --> 00:50:56,389
My father researched
shooting locations.

391
00:50:56,472 --> 00:51:01,269
He suggested Guadalupe,
where you are now digging.

392
00:51:01,352 --> 00:51:04,397
Tell me more.

393
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:07,358
I can show you instead.

394
00:51:10,570 --> 00:51:14,323
Keep an eye on the spaces!

395
00:51:14,407 --> 00:51:19,871
- Shall we weld them on?
- We have to see that they are in order.

396
00:51:19,954 --> 00:51:26,002
- We only have a few hours.
- Why is there such a hurry?

397
00:51:26,085 --> 00:51:29,213
If I told you, you
would run from here.

398
00:51:29,297 --> 00:51:34,427
There is a message on the
panels that I must translate tonight.

399
00:51:35,678 --> 00:51:38,931
Does this have anything to do with Meagan?

400
00:51:39,015 --> 00:51:41,642
Yes.

401
00:52:00,870 --> 00:52:03,039
Freemason...

402
00:52:05,416 --> 00:52:11,756
Lord Carnarvon's group found
Tutankhamun's tomb in November 1921.

403
00:52:11,839 --> 00:52:15,468
DeMille's film was
still in pre-production.

404
00:52:15,551 --> 00:52:22,266
Given the excavation, it
was difficult to record in Egypt.

405
00:52:22,350 --> 00:52:25,603
Besides, it would have cost too much.

406
00:52:25,686 --> 00:52:30,107
In the end, DeMille succumbed
to pressure from investors.

407
00:52:50,711 --> 00:52:54,006
Wait. The studio wonders-

408
00:52:54,090 --> 00:53:00,054
- why it takes two weeks to film
an eighth of a page of the script.

409
00:53:00,137 --> 00:53:04,225
Remember that eighth of a page?

410
00:53:04,308 --> 00:53:10,356
I don't memorize the scripts. But
Mr. DeMille always thinks about the budget.

411
00:53:10,439 --> 00:53:18,114
- Is this movie different?
- I thought you noted the line.

412
00:53:18,197 --> 00:53:21,993
Tell. How's the line going?

413
00:53:22,076 --> 00:53:28,875
"After persuading Pharaoh,
Moses led his people out of Egypt."

414
00:53:31,169 --> 00:53:37,091
- Holy Toledo...
- It's actually Ramses II's city.

415
00:53:37,175 --> 00:53:40,970
Now I know what 15 mil timber looks like.

416
00:53:41,053 --> 00:53:48,060
- That was a good guess.
- I'm the one who pays the bills.

417
00:53:48,144 --> 00:53:54,901
If every meter of timber is not
used, someone's ears will get hot.

418
00:53:54,984 --> 00:53:58,821
Then take me to Mr. DeMille.

419
00:54:06,204 --> 00:54:09,415
I want a thousand Israelites at…

420
00:54:09,498 --> 00:54:13,461
Ira!
How was the train ride from Manhattan?

421
00:54:13,544 --> 00:54:19,300
I have never been in the desert, but
now I understand the exodus from Egypt.

422
00:54:19,383 --> 00:54:23,804
How fitting that you are here today.

423
00:54:23,888 --> 00:54:28,059
Pharaoh's legions
await my orders.

424
00:54:28,142 --> 00:54:33,898
Mr. DeMille, the delays
risk sinking the studio.

425
00:54:33,981 --> 00:54:39,070
I can stop recording and call the
movie "The Five Commandments".

426
00:54:39,153 --> 00:54:44,200
Don't worry - people all over
the world will want to see the film.

427
00:54:44,283 --> 00:54:50,331
For 15 cents a ticket
we will be millionaires.

428
00:54:50,414 --> 00:54:53,376
Besides, we'll be done tomorrow.

429
00:54:53,459 --> 00:54:57,755
Come on! Now we free your people.

430
00:55:01,884 --> 00:55:05,638
Listen carefully.
We have valuable stuff in the tents-

431
00:55:05,721 --> 00:55:08,724
-and nothing must disappear.

432
00:55:08,808 --> 00:55:13,688
We have an important scene
tomorrow, so everything has to be here.

433
00:55:13,771 --> 00:55:17,525
If you fall asleep, you will be fired.

434
00:55:19,068 --> 00:55:22,530
What are you waiting for? Speed ​​up.

435
00:55:24,824 --> 00:55:27,577
No brains - just muscles.

436
00:55:53,603 --> 00:55:56,355
Hello, sweetie.

437
00:56:09,744 --> 00:56:12,455
O'Neal!

438
00:56:12,538 --> 00:56:16,792
- It was hell then.
- You can't be there!

439
00:56:18,085 --> 00:56:20,671
Damn.

440
00:56:22,256 --> 00:56:25,760
I see you.

441
00:56:27,803 --> 00:56:31,974
You picked the wrong guy to fuck with.

442
00:56:56,874 --> 00:57:03,506
Lord Carnarvon was not alone
in searching for missing graves.

443
00:57:03,589 --> 00:57:09,720
DeMille's men found diggers
who were actually grave robbers.

444
00:57:09,804 --> 00:57:13,558
Unbeknownst to DeMille-

445
00:57:13,641 --> 00:57:19,939
- the smugglers sold them priceless
antiquities of mysterious origin.

446
00:57:20,022 --> 00:57:24,902
What I am about to tell is
denied by both countries.

447
00:57:24,986 --> 00:57:29,782
Further up the Nile,
at today's Abu Simbel-

448
00:57:29,866 --> 00:57:34,871
- there is an old city whose ruins can
be compared to those of the Giza plateau.

449
00:57:34,954 --> 00:57:38,624
It is buried under the
sands of the Sahara.

450
00:57:38,708 --> 00:57:45,047
Among other things, there
is an inverted pyramid here.

451
00:57:45,131 --> 00:57:47,592
An antipyramid.

452
00:57:47,675 --> 00:57:52,096
A hole in the ground which, according
to some, emits negative energy.

453
00:57:52,180 --> 00:57:55,349
- Where did the artifacts come from?
- Yes.

454
00:57:55,433 --> 00:58:00,730
It was rumored on the set that the
city was the entrance to the Duat-

455
00:58:00,813 --> 00:58:05,401
- the kingdom of the dead of
the Egyptians, what we call hell.

456
00:58:05,484 --> 00:58:09,572
It was one of the items we
found in the throne room.

457
00:58:09,655 --> 00:58:16,579
The room was commissioned by
DeMille, to enclose the objects' powers.

458
00:58:16,662 --> 00:58:22,418
- An underground vault.
- Who could build such a tomb?

459
00:58:22,502 --> 00:58:26,130
Constructors of the Pyramids.

460
00:58:26,214 --> 00:58:32,720
A brotherhood that created the
oldest of cities and Solomon's temple.

461
00:58:32,803 --> 00:58:35,431
- Which ones?
- The Freemasons.

462
00:58:35,515 --> 00:58:40,436
The angle hook, the fit
and the all-seeing eye.

463
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:43,773
- So DeMille...
- ...was a Freemason.

464
00:58:43,856 --> 00:58:47,527
Lodge 16 in New York.

465
00:58:48,694 --> 00:58:52,448
The rest is unfortunately
shrouded in obscurity.

466
00:59:15,304 --> 00:59:17,765
Cody...

467
00:59:19,058 --> 00:59:25,690
Take the sand fleas out to Guadalupe.
I've found Patrick's jeep.

468
00:59:38,411 --> 00:59:41,455
Hello...

469
00:59:41,539 --> 00:59:44,625
It's dangerous to be here.

470
00:59:48,337 --> 00:59:51,465
Has something happened?

471
01:00:39,305 --> 01:00:42,391
Get out of my mind!

472
01:01:04,455 --> 01:01:07,333
Did you come up with something?

473
01:01:13,714 --> 01:01:17,093
No not yet.

474
01:01:20,263 --> 01:01:24,100
I started to feel quite queasy.

475
01:01:27,645 --> 01:01:31,274
- Can you turn around?
- Sure.

476
01:01:31,357 --> 01:01:35,653
But my testosterone protests.

477
01:01:35,736 --> 01:01:39,073
I thought Nigel was
going to call the police.

478
01:01:41,868 --> 01:01:46,455
Me too. It was nice
to lend the documents.

479
01:01:46,539 --> 01:01:53,880
He knows I take care of them.
I hope they can give us answers.

480
01:01:55,965 --> 01:01:58,467
Yes...

481
01:01:58,551 --> 01:02:02,388
I liked you better sunkig.

482
01:02:02,471 --> 01:02:06,684
- But you're pretty now too.
- Who is this boy?

483
01:02:09,228 --> 01:02:12,648
Hang up... It's my grandfather...

484
01:02:12,732 --> 01:02:16,611
...with his father.

485
01:02:52,688 --> 01:02:56,817
- Moses, go ahead.
- Sorry?

486
01:02:56,901 --> 01:02:59,487
Certainly.

487
01:02:59,570 --> 01:03:02,823
Lord, we...

488
01:03:04,325 --> 01:03:09,247
Bless this earth and watch
over it so that this boy...

489
01:03:09,330 --> 01:03:12,375
...can bury his treasure chest.

490
01:03:12,458 --> 01:03:16,045
- Time capsule.
- Time capsule?

491
01:03:16,128 --> 01:03:19,632
Where did you get that from?

492
01:03:19,715 --> 01:03:23,219
May someone one day find these things…

493
01:03:23,302 --> 01:03:26,180
...and become rich like a king.

494
01:03:27,056 --> 01:03:29,892
Or pharaoh.

495
01:03:31,435 --> 01:03:36,774
So this is where my actors are.

496
01:03:38,234 --> 01:03:41,404
What are you burying, young man?

497
01:03:41,487 --> 01:03:47,368
- A time capsule.
- I don't do that.

498
01:03:47,451 --> 01:03:52,039
Why don't you bury
it at home instead?

499
01:03:52,123 --> 01:03:57,086
It's dark when I get home.
And I don't have Moses there.

500
01:03:57,170 --> 01:03:59,964
Johnny...

501
01:04:00,047 --> 01:04:05,011
And this is a special place.

502
01:04:05,094 --> 01:04:11,475
In a thousand years someone
will find it and see how we lived.

503
01:04:11,559 --> 01:04:14,187
Thousand years...

504
01:04:14,270 --> 01:04:18,983
I have some things I like
to hide for a thousand years.

505
01:04:20,568 --> 01:04:23,404
Carry on, young man.

506
01:04:24,697 --> 01:04:28,117
"And a little boy herds them."

507
01:04:33,831 --> 01:04:38,628
- And that's DeMille?
- Absolutely.

508
01:05:22,088 --> 01:05:26,676
Where's that
damned thing, Cully?

509
01:05:26,759 --> 01:05:30,012
I don't know, C.B.

510
01:05:30,096 --> 01:05:33,182
I told them to bury everything.

511
01:05:33,266 --> 01:05:38,396
What a waste to bury
all the treasures like this.

512
01:05:38,479 --> 01:05:41,315
Now at least we close the danger.

513
01:05:41,399 --> 01:05:47,071
- Shall we put up a warning sign?
- No, why draw attention to it?

514
01:05:47,154 --> 01:05:51,033
Only a fool would apply here.

515
01:05:51,117 --> 01:05:55,162
We could build a hundred
houses with the lumber-

516
01:05:55,246 --> 01:05:58,457
- but we can't
afford to let it go.

517
01:05:58,541 --> 01:06:04,130
The sands of Guadalupe
may keep our little secret.

518
01:06:04,213 --> 01:06:06,966
See you in Culver City.

519
01:06:15,308 --> 01:06:17,476
Johnny!

520
01:06:18,394 --> 01:06:21,480
This casket...

521
01:06:22,523 --> 01:06:26,736
It looks like the casket he buried.

522
01:06:28,946 --> 01:06:32,742
They didn't know what they had.
It is the same.

523
01:06:32,825 --> 01:06:35,369
Yes it is.

524
01:06:37,413 --> 01:06:40,708
- Have you ordered anything?
- No.

525
01:06:45,922 --> 01:06:49,842
- What has happened?
- I have to see the amulet.

526
01:06:49,926 --> 01:06:53,387
- Your face is burnt.
- Come in and sit down.

527
01:06:53,471 --> 01:06:57,016
- Do not interfere!
- I just want to help.

528
01:06:57,099 --> 01:07:00,353
- You have it, right?
- No, I have it.

529
01:07:00,436 --> 01:07:07,693
- Why do you want it?
- What do I gain by telling?

530
01:07:07,777 --> 01:07:11,113
- Calm down.
- Stay away from my wife!

531
01:07:11,197 --> 01:07:15,034
- Help me!
- Shut up!

532
01:07:15,660 --> 01:07:20,164
You like her, right?
She's really cute.

533
01:07:20,248 --> 01:07:23,835
- Answer!
- Yes, I like her.

534
01:07:23,918 --> 01:07:29,298
Now we'll see how much.
Give me the amulet.

535
01:07:35,847 --> 01:07:39,267
Okay. As long as you don't hurt her.

536
01:07:43,521 --> 01:07:47,233
- He is coming.
- Who then?

537
01:07:47,316 --> 01:07:50,486
Who do you think?

538
01:07:50,570 --> 01:07:54,991
That thing you and your
grandfather unleashed. The Avenger.

539
01:07:55,074 --> 01:07:58,703
You haven't looked into his eyes.

540
01:07:58,786 --> 01:08:02,123
He hasn't been in your brain.

541
01:08:02,206 --> 01:08:06,544
I have seen him.
He really exists.

542
01:08:09,255 --> 01:08:13,217
Remember I don't believe in God?
He is here.

543
01:08:15,011 --> 01:08:18,848
And the amulet is to him
like garlic to a vampire.

544
01:08:18,931 --> 01:08:22,727
- No!
- I made a deal with him.

545
01:08:22,810 --> 01:08:26,772
If I destroy the amulet,
he will let me live.

546
01:08:26,856 --> 01:08:30,067
I needed to make sure.

547
01:08:37,992 --> 01:08:42,163
- What's that?
- He followed me here.

548
01:08:42,246 --> 01:08:45,166
- We have to knit!
- Give me the amulet!

549
01:08:45,249 --> 01:08:47,919
Now!

550
01:09:26,165 --> 01:09:29,418
- Drive!
- I will!

551
01:09:58,197 --> 01:10:02,159
- You got rid of them.
- When you are chased by such insects...

552
01:10:02,243 --> 01:10:06,706
- ...you have no choice.
- Did you see Jesse's face?

553
01:10:06,789 --> 01:10:11,252
The face above the hand that
threatened you with a knife? I saw it.

554
01:10:11,335 --> 01:10:16,507
It wasn't him.
I saw it in his eyes.

555
01:10:16,591 --> 01:10:21,804
- He tried to kill us.
- Can you stay? I feel sick.

556
01:10:30,938 --> 01:10:34,275
Think Jesse would do something like that.

557
01:10:34,358 --> 01:10:38,988
You said it wasn't him.
Something has happened to him.

558
01:10:39,071 --> 01:10:42,033
It must have something to do with this one.

559
01:10:42,116 --> 01:10:46,412
- Is that supposed to protect us?
- Yes.

560
01:10:46,495 --> 01:10:50,208
The creature wants
to destroy or use it.

561
01:10:50,291 --> 01:10:53,794
What is this avenger?

562
01:10:53,878 --> 01:10:59,091
One of the guardians who take
revenge on the grave robbers.

563
01:10:59,175 --> 01:11:03,304
And we released it?

564
01:11:03,387 --> 01:11:06,390
Buford might have some artillery.

565
01:11:06,474 --> 01:11:09,477
Artillery? Buford?

566
01:11:09,560 --> 01:11:12,980
That sounds like jarhead talk.

567
01:11:13,064 --> 01:11:16,400
Now we take it easy. Time-out.

568
01:11:16,484 --> 01:11:21,656
Your ex might get away with
it, but you should know better.

569
01:11:21,739 --> 01:11:27,036
"Jarhead" refers to the Marine Corps.
But I was in the army.

570
01:11:27,119 --> 01:11:32,250
You can call me
G.I., basse or soldier.

571
01:11:32,333 --> 01:11:35,545
Sorry, soldier.

572
01:11:35,628 --> 01:11:39,715
I'm sorry if I hurt anyone
in the Marine Corps.

573
01:11:39,799 --> 01:11:45,012
- I greet them.
- Thanks.

574
01:11:45,096 --> 01:11:51,310
It might be worth knowing
that Buford is a bit special.

575
01:11:51,394 --> 01:11:56,732
- Okay?
- My other friends are not like him.

576
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:16,502
I'm so glad you called.

577
01:12:16,586 --> 01:12:23,426
I was watching that monster channel,
and after about a dozen beers...

578
01:12:23,509 --> 01:12:26,888
- ...it gets pretty shady.
- I know.

579
01:12:26,971 --> 01:12:29,974
Doc and I need some stuff.

580
01:12:30,057 --> 01:12:33,436
- Take what you need.
- Are you a doctor?

581
01:12:33,519 --> 01:12:39,358
- Archaeologist.
- Perfect. I can't find mine.

582
01:12:39,442 --> 01:12:45,865
I can only sit for four hours at a
time. I have a mark on my butt...

583
01:12:45,948 --> 01:12:53,497
I am not a doctor.
I am an academic doctor.

584
01:12:53,581 --> 01:12:59,962
Damn. I had hoped not
to have to go to the doctor.

585
01:13:00,046 --> 01:13:03,549
They have forms
that are one page long.

586
01:13:03,633 --> 01:13:07,929
But I understand you. Did
Mark tell you I was in Grenada?

587
01:13:08,012 --> 01:13:12,975
You, Buford?
You have improved your range.

588
01:13:13,059 --> 01:13:17,980
I take what I come across.

589
01:13:18,064 --> 01:13:23,027
That's right, I almost forgot:
I have some Willie Peter.

590
01:13:23,110 --> 01:13:25,905
- Seriously?
- Willie Peter?

591
01:13:25,988 --> 01:13:32,453
Yes, but don't say anything. The authorities
have been and talked to my neighbors.

592
01:13:32,537 --> 01:13:36,916
I'd love to have it handy...

593
01:13:36,999 --> 01:13:40,378
...when doomsday comes.

594
01:13:40,461 --> 01:13:45,132
- I'd love to have some Willie Peter.
- Take it for yourself.

595
01:13:45,216 --> 01:13:50,304
Priscilla brings a
whole box from Idaho.

596
01:13:50,388 --> 01:13:54,475
One more thing: Do you
have any rocket launchers?

597
01:13:54,559 --> 01:13:57,520
Under the teddy bear.

598
01:13:58,813 --> 01:14:04,151
- Who is Willie Peter?
- Willie Petey is white phosphorus.

599
01:14:04,235 --> 01:14:07,154
It makes napalm look like sunscreen.

600
01:14:07,238 --> 01:14:12,410
I tested a little on national day.
You should have seen it.

601
01:14:12,493 --> 01:14:17,331
Okay, Buf. Now I am ready.
What do I owe you?

602
01:14:17,415 --> 01:14:20,501
Well, I guess...

603
01:14:20,585 --> 01:14:23,963
...that we can agree on something.

604
01:14:24,046 --> 01:14:27,842
Take it easy now.

605
01:14:27,925 --> 01:14:33,097
We've found most of it,
so take what you need.

606
01:14:33,181 --> 01:14:37,310
Do you want me to come with you?

607
01:14:38,311 --> 01:14:41,939
No.

608
01:14:42,023 --> 01:14:47,695
- Some things a man must do alone.
- I understand exactly what you mean.

609
01:14:47,778 --> 01:14:51,490
Nothing tells you what
kind of man you are-

610
01:14:51,574 --> 01:14:55,411
-like when you stand up for something.

611
01:14:55,494 --> 01:15:01,459
- Time passes.
- I know. Will you help me carry?

612
01:15:18,476 --> 01:15:21,187
We've certainly had visitors.

613
01:15:28,319 --> 01:15:30,321
Damn.

614
01:15:31,656 --> 01:15:36,577
We probably won't get anywhere.
The car is broken.

615
01:15:36,661 --> 01:15:40,540
- What has happened?
- Jesse has happened.

616
01:15:40,623 --> 01:15:44,418
Has anyone trespassed?

617
01:15:44,502 --> 01:15:50,049
Ninja and Buttercup
will get for not scolding.

618
01:15:50,132 --> 01:15:55,388
Buford! This garbage
doesn't carry itself out.

619
01:15:56,055 --> 01:16:01,310
Into the house, woman!
Download Moses and My Flip-Flops.

620
01:16:01,394 --> 01:16:05,481
I will beat the rudeness out of you.

621
01:16:05,565 --> 01:16:09,735
- You get along as usual...
- You have no idea.

622
01:16:10,987 --> 01:16:16,033
- Do those cars work?
- This morning they did.

623
01:16:16,117 --> 01:16:19,745
Choose which one you want.

624
01:16:19,829 --> 01:16:22,832
Thank you, Buford. See you soon.

625
01:16:40,892 --> 01:16:43,269
The garbage is out.

626
01:16:54,947 --> 01:16:58,910
- What are you doing?
- I will be back soon.

627
01:16:58,993 --> 01:17:03,706
Don't hurt him. He's just sick.

628
01:17:03,789 --> 01:17:08,211
I'll remember that
when he wants to kill me.

629
01:17:41,911 --> 01:17:46,499
Is the soldier ready
for the second round?

630
01:17:48,584 --> 01:17:52,588
I should have stamped
you with my license plate.

631
01:17:52,672 --> 01:17:56,634
- I'll have to do it next time.
- Then it's too late.

632
01:17:56,717 --> 01:18:01,097
- Be careful.
- "Be careful."

633
01:18:01,180 --> 01:18:05,476
It's a miracle
we've been married.

634
01:18:06,602 --> 01:18:09,981
We can help you.

635
01:18:10,064 --> 01:18:14,819
Help me?
Just give me the amulet and shut up.

636
01:18:14,902 --> 01:18:19,490
Do you want the amulet?
You get it if you drop her.

637
01:18:19,574 --> 01:18:24,453
So noble. No thanks.
I am a traditional husband.

638
01:18:24,537 --> 01:18:28,082
Death may do us part.

639
01:18:28,165 --> 01:18:32,253
Alice will be a present
for my new boss.

640
01:18:33,880 --> 01:18:36,174
Take it easy.

641
01:18:37,717 --> 01:18:41,846
Release her if you want the amulet.

642
01:18:41,929 --> 01:18:47,560
Do not move. Otherwise, you will
soon find your thoughts on the car there.

643
01:18:47,643 --> 01:18:51,814
- Give me the rifle.
- Be careful.

644
01:18:51,898 --> 01:18:57,486
Mark, tell your friend
to show some respect.

645
01:18:57,570 --> 01:19:00,573
The guests of honor have arrived.

646
01:19:01,616 --> 01:19:05,203
Are they snakes?

647
01:19:08,789 --> 01:19:12,668
You will kill us all!

648
01:19:13,211 --> 01:19:15,922
Ground!

649
01:19:24,013 --> 01:19:26,891
What the hell...?

650
01:19:29,727 --> 01:19:33,940
You and your stupid friends and…

651
01:19:47,078 --> 01:19:51,874
I probably pissed myself.
Don't tell anyone.

652
01:19:51,958 --> 01:19:54,961
Run and save your girlfriend!

653
01:20:24,240 --> 01:20:27,869
You always show up
when something happens.

654
01:20:31,372 --> 01:20:35,042
But this time I'm ready.

655
01:20:59,150 --> 01:21:02,612
Your new boyfriend is enterprising.

656
01:21:16,501 --> 01:21:18,878
We'll have some company.

657
01:22:21,983 --> 01:22:26,070
If they make it to the
dunes, we'll drop them!

658
01:25:02,810 --> 01:25:06,105
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

659
01:25:08,691 --> 01:25:10,860
Look!

660
01:25:15,615 --> 01:25:18,784
Our ruler is here to get us!

661
01:26:00,284 --> 01:26:03,704
Now he belongs to history.

662
01:26:03,788 --> 01:26:07,291
It's the only thing
he's ever loved.

663
01:26:07,375 --> 01:26:14,006
No... He already died when
that thing got hold of him.

664
01:26:14,090 --> 01:26:17,426
I don't understand that he is dead.

665
01:26:17,510 --> 01:26:21,639
It will be alright. Look at me.

666
01:26:21,722 --> 01:26:25,101
Do not think about it.

667
01:27:01,679 --> 01:27:04,223
Oops.

668
01:27:12,899 --> 01:27:16,360
- How is it?
- We have to wait for the X-rays.

669
01:27:16,444 --> 01:27:20,615
How are you?
I didn't want to miss this.

670
01:27:20,698 --> 01:27:25,161
- You have the amulet, right?
- It is here.

671
01:27:25,244 --> 01:27:28,497
- I had it.
- You must have lost it.

672
01:27:28,581 --> 01:27:31,167
Where!

673
01:27:36,047 --> 01:27:41,010
That's right.
Im-La-Ra, Set's left hand.

674
01:27:54,148 --> 01:27:57,443
- Do you have any ideas?
- Not directly.

675
01:27:57,527 --> 01:28:01,989
- You said the amulet protects.
- We have to take it back.

676
01:28:05,535 --> 01:28:08,329
Look!

677
01:28:15,962 --> 01:28:22,093
- What is he doing?
- He doesn't want to go in.

678
01:28:22,176 --> 01:28:26,848
So this is like a fort.

679
01:28:26,931 --> 01:28:30,560
- Like the Alamo.
- The lost.

680
01:28:30,643 --> 01:28:33,896
How about Fort Knox?

681
01:28:38,150 --> 01:28:42,446
If he's afraid of the
hieroglyphs, it's okay, right?

682
01:28:42,530 --> 01:28:46,242
I think he's more enterprising than that.

683
01:28:49,579 --> 01:28:53,624
- He doesn't need to come in.
- It's not true.

684
01:29:06,637 --> 01:29:09,515
Get the grenades!

685
01:30:03,528 --> 01:30:05,655
Nigel!

686
01:30:10,660 --> 01:30:12,620
Hello!

687
01:30:30,972 --> 01:30:34,100
I am sick of you!

688
01:30:51,576 --> 01:30:55,538
Hello! Come on!

689
01:30:57,123 --> 01:31:01,335
- Which end do you shoot with?
- Come on!

690
01:31:01,419 --> 01:31:05,047
Do you want a cookie? Come then.

691
01:31:07,258 --> 01:31:09,802
Come and take me.

692
01:31:44,212 --> 01:31:47,340
Rocket Launcher! The explosive!

693
01:31:49,133 --> 01:31:52,345
I have the amulet!

694
01:31:55,223 --> 01:31:57,767
It's not a toy.

695
01:32:00,937 --> 01:32:07,026
Come on. Hold it. He doesn't
want anyone to use it against him.

696
01:32:07,109 --> 01:32:10,238
What are you doing?

697
01:32:10,321 --> 01:32:13,324
Do you want it? You are welcome.

698
01:32:16,869 --> 01:32:20,164
I hope you have sunscreen.

699
01:32:56,868 --> 01:32:59,954
Did you know he
would melt into glass?

700
01:33:00,037 --> 01:33:04,458
Willie Peter and I have known
each other for a long time.

701
01:33:04,542 --> 01:33:07,128
Nigel?

702
01:33:07,211 --> 01:33:10,381
I don't think he made it.

703
01:33:10,464 --> 01:33:17,555
Take it easy.
The rumor of my death, etc.

704
01:33:17,638 --> 01:33:21,767
I almost thought
it was out with us.

705
01:33:21,851 --> 01:33:25,229
Finally the cavalry arrives.

706
01:33:25,313 --> 01:33:28,983
The cavalry?
I guess they are Freemasons.

707
01:33:29,066 --> 01:33:32,737
My brothers from the lodge in Hollywood.

708
01:33:32,820 --> 01:33:37,575
This time we'll probably use a
little extra concrete just to be safe.

709
01:33:37,658 --> 01:33:41,329
And maybe a little lead.

710
01:33:41,412 --> 01:33:44,790
Don't make up nonsense now!

711
01:33:46,042 --> 01:33:48,836
That was incredible.

712
01:33:48,920 --> 01:33:53,132
There is one more thing
I must do before we part.

713
01:33:53,216 --> 01:33:55,927
What?

714
01:34:06,938 --> 01:34:12,360
We have enough time for
one more thing before we part.
