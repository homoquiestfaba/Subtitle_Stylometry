00:00:02,419 --> 00:00:04,546
(screams and sirens)

00:00:08,091 --> 00:00:11,512
("Double Trouble Lover"
By Kevin Williams & Dread Flimstone)

3
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:17,893
(reggae music starts)

4
00:02:48,252 --> 00:02:50,420
(screams and sirens)

5
00:02:59,388 --> 00:03:01,682
Oh, damn it.

6
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:06,728
This thing is not designed
for a human to pour coffee with.

7
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:08,105
Go sit down, I'll bring
your breakfast.

8
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:10,899
- It's a gag coffeepot.
- It's okay.

9
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:14,862
Here you go, sweetie.

10
00:03:15,988 --> 00:03:18,866
I was reading about
this new sex scandal.

11
00:03:22,953 --> 00:03:26,081
So, last night was okay?
It wasn't too quick?

12
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:27,916
- It was nice.
- Are you sure?

13
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:32,171
- I've got so much on my mind...
- It was nice. It always is.

14
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:34,339
- It always is?
- Um-hmm.

15
00:03:36,508 --> 00:03:38,343
It always is?

16
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:40,095
You want some melon?

17
00:03:40,137 --> 00:03:42,723
You're totally satisfied
with our sex life?

18
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:44,433
Yeah, I'm totally satisfied, honey.

19
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:46,602
I'll get you some melon.

20
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:49,313
And there's nothing
you would do different?

21
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:52,065
No changes you would make?

22
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:55,485
Different?

23
00:03:55,527 --> 00:03:59,114
Yeah...
nothing you wanna try?

24
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:02,659
Try the melon...
it's so good.

25
00:04:02,701 --> 00:04:05,162
Nothing...

26
00:04:05,162 --> 00:04:07,456
you've always been
curious about...?

27
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:10,459
No, I'm just
completely happy.

28
00:04:10,501 --> 00:04:12,544
You are?

29
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:15,255
Try the melon,
it's so good.

30
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:24,473
(Radio:)
Have you ever practiced lesbianism?

31
00:04:24,515 --> 00:04:27,351
- No.
- Other women don't excite you?

32
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:29,853
- No.
- Have these ladies come on to you?

33
00:04:29,895 --> 00:04:33,357
Umm... if so, I didn't notice it.

34
00:04:33,357 --> 00:04:35,859
Are you having lunch
with me today?

35
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:39,738
No, sorry, Didi,
Marty's taking me to lunch.

36
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:44,201
That's okay, I understand.

37
00:04:44,243 --> 00:04:46,620
If he cancels, though,
I'm still available.

38
00:04:46,662 --> 00:04:48,830
Your husband's taking you to lunch?
That's sweet.

39
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:50,958
Yeah, he is sweet.

40
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:52,668
(doorbell rings)

41
00:04:55,087 --> 00:04:56,672
Hey, beautiful.

42
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:57,756
Hey...

43
00:04:58,674 --> 00:05:00,342
- You hungry?
- Ooh, I'm starved.

44
00:05:00,384 --> 00:05:02,678
- Can we go someplace nice?
- Anywhere you want.

45
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:09,309
Darn, you showed.

46
00:05:09,351 --> 00:05:12,312
If you didn't show,
I was gonna take her to lunch.

47
00:05:12,354 --> 00:05:16,024
Sorry to disappoint you, Didi,
but I showed.

48
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:20,362
Yes, you did, I'm not
gonna hold it against you, though.

49
00:05:20,404 --> 00:05:22,865
Have a nice lunch
with your sexy-ass wife.

50
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:24,491
- I will.
- You ready?

51
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:25,951
Definitely.

52
00:05:25,993 --> 00:05:29,246
What, you're mad? Don't be mad,
it's a nice restaurant.

53
00:05:29,288 --> 00:05:33,834
Come on, I don't have time
I'm behind the eight-ball at work.

54
00:05:33,876 --> 00:05:35,878
I made that doctor's appointment
for you today.

55
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,212
Don't forget it, okay?

56
00:05:37,254 --> 00:05:40,841
I cannot believe I gotta
let 'em put a camera in my ass.

57
00:05:40,883 --> 00:05:44,720
You're at the age where
you gotta take care of yourself.

58
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:46,263
They called the office.
Know what they wanna know?

59
00:05:46,305 --> 00:05:48,432
Do I wanna pay extra
to use the Sony?

60
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:51,560
They got a Sony product
that goes up my ass.

61
00:05:51,602 --> 00:05:53,979
"Sony Assman".

62
00:05:55,606 --> 00:05:59,568
So what's the deal
with little Didi at work?

63
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:01,445
Any new lesbian stories?

64
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:05,073
I don't think she's a lesbian.
She might be bisexual.

65
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:08,202
That's better still.
We like bisexual.

66
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:10,871
- We do?
- Yes, we do.

67
00:06:10,913 --> 00:06:12,956
Is she openly bisexual?

68
00:06:12,998 --> 00:06:15,375
What do you mean
by "openly bisexual"?

69
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:17,586
I mean, is she openly bisexual?

70
00:06:17,628 --> 00:06:19,546
If I went right now to the salon,
and opened the front door,

71
00:06:19,588 --> 00:06:23,091
I walked in and yelled,
"Hey, anybody here bisexual?",

72
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:24,760
what would little Didi do?

73
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:27,262
Do we have to talk about Didi's
sexuality all the time?

74
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:28,597
Yes...

75
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,808
You're totally obsessed by this
every time you see her.

76
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:35,312
She's hot for you, Laura.
It's the start of the new millenium,

77
00:06:35,354 --> 00:06:37,564
everyone's doin' it.
Don't be so straight.

78
00:06:37,606 --> 00:06:39,441
I am straight.

79
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:42,319
I think it'd be good for ya.

80
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,238
- Is that what you think?
- I do...

81
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:47,199
I think it'd be good for us.
Menage a trois,

82
00:06:47,241 --> 00:06:49,701
inside the confines
of a good marriage.

83
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:51,245
What happens if I like it?

84
00:06:51,286 --> 00:06:53,872
If you like it? Great.

85
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:57,417
What if you come home
and we are going at it in our bedroom?

86
00:06:57,459 --> 00:06:59,294
Wouldn't you be just a little hurt?

87
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:03,006
Hurt? Only if I smash my face
on the headboard...

88
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:05,300
diving under the blankets
with the two of you...

89
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:08,345
I'd be thrilled you found
a new hobby you liked.

90
00:07:11,807 --> 00:07:16,019
See how clear that picture is?

91
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:18,063
The same way you're looking
around the office,

92
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:20,691
I'm looking at the lower intestines,

93
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:22,693
and then this curves it around...

94
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:27,197
And this is actually a job
you wanted as a kid?

95
00:07:29,032 --> 00:07:32,536
That's funny.
Lie down there.

96
00:07:32,578 --> 00:07:34,788
We'll see who's laughing
in about a minute.

97
00:07:34,872 --> 00:07:38,167
Knees forward, if you would, please.

98
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:40,085
Be gentle.
I know this comes as a shock,

99
00:07:40,127 --> 00:07:42,546
but I'm not real excited about this.

100
00:07:42,588 --> 00:07:45,549
No... that makes two of us.

101
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:49,553
Oh-oh-oh!
Wait, wait...

102
00:07:49,595 --> 00:07:50,846
Ow, ow!

103
00:07:50,888 --> 00:07:53,765
Pull it out, Jerry!
Pull it out!

104
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:56,768
Hey, four-year-old,
it's just the lubricant.

105
00:07:56,810 --> 00:08:00,439
I haven't started
with the probe yet.

106
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,609
Gentle is the buzzword
for today, okay?

107
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:07,070
Ohh!

108
00:08:17,706 --> 00:08:21,877
Have you seen that new
Porsche Boxter?

109
00:08:25,923 --> 00:08:28,217
It's a beauty.

110
00:08:28,258 --> 00:08:30,886
Ohh-hh!!

111
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:37,100
(doorbell rings)

112
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:39,520
Hey... Jane!

113
00:08:39,561 --> 00:08:41,313
- Hi!
- How're you doin'?

114
00:08:41,355 --> 00:08:42,940
I didn't know you were in town.

115
00:08:42,981 --> 00:08:46,026
I'm going to San Francisco.
I was gonna visit on my way back,

116
00:08:46,068 --> 00:08:48,070
but I decided to visit
on my way up.

117
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:50,113
- Didn't Laura tell you?
- No, she didn't.

118
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:52,282
But that's okay.
You're always welcome, you know that.

119
00:08:54,785 --> 00:08:56,245
What?

120
00:08:57,496 --> 00:09:01,208
I just miss you.
It's great to see my best friend.

121
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:03,085
I miss you too.

122
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:15,097
- I love this.
- I just got it.

123
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:17,266
That is so not me.

124
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:18,559
No.

125
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:21,687
So how are your sculptures doing?

126
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:26,400
They're doing great.
I think a gallery wants to show them.

127
00:09:26,441 --> 00:09:29,611
I love this one.
Is this new?

128
00:09:29,653 --> 00:09:31,697
It really works on the piano.

129
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:35,325
Isn't it great, Marty?

130
00:09:35,367 --> 00:09:38,704
$18,000 in lessons,
and tchotchkes for the living room,

131
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:42,833
I couldn't be more happy.
Are you kiddin' me, Jane?

132
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:45,669
I don't want her having hobbies,

133
00:09:45,711 --> 00:09:48,881
- I want it to be all about me.
- About you, huh?

134
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:51,049
You should be making
little sculptures of me.

135
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:55,554
Feels so good.

136
00:09:55,596 --> 00:09:57,598
It's so good to see you.

137
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:01,894
Wow, look at this,
erotic feet massaging.

138
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:05,480
This is great.
Good and gay, I love this.

139
00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:08,025
- It is not gay.
- What?

140
00:10:08,025 --> 00:10:09,651
Can you imagine me
and one of my buddies...

141
00:10:09,693 --> 00:10:13,238
sitting on this couch,
rubbing each other's feet?

142
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,199
Not a pretty sight, is it?

143
00:10:15,199 --> 00:10:17,868
Women can get away with this,
and it's a beautiful thing.

144
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:19,828
It's not gay, Marty.

145
00:10:21,038 --> 00:10:22,998
It's gay, and I love it.

146
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,960
I'm not into women, but if I was,
this would be my first stop,

147
00:10:27,002 --> 00:10:30,172
and you, my dear,
would be in serious trouble.

148
00:10:30,214 --> 00:10:32,341
That's it. I'm going upstairs
to write to "Penthouse".

149
00:10:33,425 --> 00:10:34,718
Is he serious?

150
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:38,222
He would love it if I would
sleep with him and a woman.

151
00:10:38,263 --> 00:10:40,349
Apparently, it's all he
and his buddies ever talk about.

152
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:42,518
What is it with these guys
and that stupid fantasy?

153
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:45,020
They can't please one woman,
let alone two.

154
00:10:45,062 --> 00:10:47,147
Maybe that's what
the second woman is for...

155
00:10:47,189 --> 00:10:49,816
to do half the work.

156
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:53,987
Diva, did the mail come?

157
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:55,822
Mmm - yes.

158
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:59,284
And I'm sorry, but they're all bills.

159
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:02,287
Well, I can handle them, okay?

160
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:04,373
Once Billy finishes this house...

161
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:07,668
those lots are gonna sell like crazy.
I'm not worried.

162
00:11:08,794 --> 00:11:11,046
Nothing fazes you, Marty.

163
00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:14,007
I'll tell you what fazes me...

164
00:11:14,049 --> 00:11:16,844
- You marrying that ski bum...
- I'll bet.

165
00:11:17,219 --> 00:11:20,681
It does... I'm concerned,
can't you tell?

166
00:11:20,764 --> 00:11:23,058
How's he gonna support you,
this guy?

167
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:26,061
What's the pay scale
for the ski patrol?

168
00:11:26,103 --> 00:11:27,896
Guy's got no future, Diva.

169
00:11:27,938 --> 00:11:30,107
Oh, he's got a future, stop it.

170
00:11:32,109 --> 00:11:34,945
The ski patrol? What's he gonna
make one day, sergeant?

171
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:39,408
Best case scenario,
you're married to a mountie.

172
00:11:40,659 --> 00:11:45,038
I got a great idea for an investor.
Dave Pembroke.

173
00:11:46,248 --> 00:11:48,041
Dave Pembroke?

174
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:50,460
From Michigan, Dave Pembroke?
I remember him...

175
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:53,755
he was a real tough guy,
beating everybody's ass.

176
00:11:53,797 --> 00:11:56,800
He was in my brother's grade,
that whole crowd of guys...

177
00:11:56,842 --> 00:11:58,802
who got their jollies
beating people up.

178
00:11:58,802 --> 00:12:04,141
Well, now he's getting some jollies
outta $30 million.

179
00:12:04,183 --> 00:12:08,437
Guy's got 18 furniture stores
down in Orange County.

180
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:10,689
Hey, Clay.
You got my note?

181
00:12:10,731 --> 00:12:16,528
I've invited him
Sunday for brunch.

182
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:18,780
Sunday's not good for me.

183
00:12:18,822 --> 00:12:21,783
Why? What's Sunday?

184
00:12:21,825 --> 00:12:26,205
You got that girl coming in?
From Fresno?

185
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:29,082
You know what, Bill?
You're married, you got two kids...

186
00:12:29,124 --> 00:12:31,835
Would you relax?
I'm having fun.

187
00:12:31,877 --> 00:12:33,754
Having fun?
You're gonna get caught.

188
00:12:33,795 --> 00:12:35,506
- I'm not gonna get caught.
- You're cheating on your wife...

189
00:12:35,547 --> 00:12:38,592
you're gonna get caught.
Listen to me...

190
00:12:38,634 --> 00:12:43,222
You're in a situation
you can't control.

191
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:45,807
And somewhere along the way,
someone, some idiot...

192
00:12:45,849 --> 00:12:48,352
is gonna say the wrong thing
at the wrong time,

193
00:12:48,352 --> 00:12:50,646
- and it's gonna get back to Carol.
- Would you relax?

194
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:56,276
- Nobody knows, Marty.
- I'll tell you who knows...

195
00:12:56,318 --> 00:12:59,988
This is gonna sound corny,
and you'll tease me later,

196
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:04,993
but I'll tell ya who knows.
God knows.

197
00:13:05,035 --> 00:13:08,038
God does not know.
And if he does know...

198
00:13:08,038 --> 00:13:10,541
- he doesn't care.
- He does care, okay?

199
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:12,584
Cheating on your wife
is not cool.

200
00:13:12,626 --> 00:13:15,546
I know - I'm gonna get struck down
by a bolt of lightning...

201
00:13:15,587 --> 00:13:18,674
- is that what you're telling me?
- Exactly...

202
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:22,261
that's what I'm saying,
and I stand real close to you,

203
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:25,013
so I'd appreciate it
if you'd get your shit together.

204
00:13:25,055 --> 00:13:31,270
Don't you judge me.
Have you seen my wife lately?

205
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:33,021
- She's fat.
- She's not fat...

206
00:13:33,063 --> 00:13:35,190
She's fat. She's not
into sex anymore...

207
00:13:35,232 --> 00:13:38,652
all she wants to do is eat.
I'm a man. I got my needs.

208
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:41,280
I have my needs, too.
At the top of my needs list,

209
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:46,034
is you to be at my house
for brunch on Sunday.

210
00:13:46,076 --> 00:13:49,663
Marty's on my case about going
to this brunch at his house.

211
00:13:49,705 --> 00:13:52,708
- Brunch?
- He's making a big deal about it.

212
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:54,501
That's a Jew thing, brunch.

213
00:13:54,543 --> 00:13:56,295
They can't decide if they want
breakfast or lunch,

214
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:58,046
so they have both.

215
00:13:58,088 --> 00:14:00,299
I can't wait
till he hears the gossip.

216
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,509
He's gonna love it.
He's got a thing for her.

217
00:14:02,551 --> 00:14:04,970
- He's got a thing for Diva?
- He would never admit it...

218
00:14:05,012 --> 00:14:07,139
but he's dying to just take her.

219
00:14:07,181 --> 00:14:09,057
So why doesn't he just do it?

220
00:14:09,099 --> 00:14:12,019
For one reason, she's engaged.
And also because...

221
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:14,313
he's very hung up
about not screwing around.

222
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:17,357
The guy's very straight that way.

223
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:19,234
I don't get that.

224
00:14:19,276 --> 00:14:21,236
European men, they've been
doing it for centuries.

225
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:23,447
Doesn't make 'em assholes.

226
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:25,657
Guy in America, gets a little
action on the side,

227
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:29,036
they label him an asshole.
I do not get that.

228
00:14:29,077 --> 00:14:33,373
And I blame the Pilgrim men.
In the beginning of our society,

229
00:14:33,415 --> 00:14:37,169
they got all religious and puritanical.

230
00:14:37,211 --> 00:14:39,755
They fucked the whole thing up.

231
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:42,591
They gave away deal points
they had no business giving away.

232
00:14:42,633 --> 00:14:44,426
Where did you hear that?

233
00:14:44,468 --> 00:14:48,138
I should have negotiated that deal.
We'd all be gettin' laid.

234
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:50,682
- Gentlewomen, what's up?
- How are you?

235
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:54,478
I'm good. Take care of your
little scheduling problem?

236
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,480
- See?
- Jew.

237
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,106
I'm not going to brunch
with Dave Pembroke.

238
00:14:58,148 --> 00:15:00,442
The guy's Republican.

239
00:15:00,484 --> 00:15:03,862
Big deal, so am I
when I'm looking for an investor.

240
00:15:03,904 --> 00:15:05,864
Wait till you hear the good gossip.

241
00:15:05,906 --> 00:15:08,909
The good gossip? Coming from you,
Murphy, it's bullshit.

242
00:15:08,951 --> 00:15:11,995
It's about your assistant... Diva.

243
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:15,082
What about Diva?

244
00:15:15,123 --> 00:15:17,125
The guy that sold car phones
to Eric Keldren's company?

245
00:15:17,167 --> 00:15:19,795
Went to college with her.
He was in her dorm.

246
00:15:19,837 --> 00:15:22,923
Said she spent a fair amount
of time on the front line...

247
00:15:22,965 --> 00:15:25,133
saw a lot of action.

248
00:15:25,175 --> 00:15:26,802
So what? What is it?

249
00:15:27,761 --> 00:15:29,513
Guess.

250
00:15:29,555 --> 00:15:30,889
She did a two-way.

251
00:15:30,931 --> 00:15:34,268
- Better...
- She did a gang-bang.

252
00:15:34,309 --> 00:15:38,021
It's coming from Eric. I don't believe
a word out of his mouth.

253
00:15:38,063 --> 00:15:39,648
Girls.

254
00:15:41,233 --> 00:15:45,988
- She did girls.
- She did girls?

255
00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:47,823
This is true?

256
00:15:47,865 --> 00:15:51,076
Diva did girls in college?

257
00:15:51,118 --> 00:15:53,620
(Laura:)
You believe that story is true?

258
00:15:53,662 --> 00:15:57,124
I believe it.
Keldren's a lot of things,

259
00:15:57,207 --> 00:15:59,084
but the guy's not a liar.

260
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:01,712
She's young.

261
00:16:01,712 --> 00:16:03,714
Young girls...

262
00:16:03,714 --> 00:16:06,341
they're all into it nowadays.
It's become very fashionable.

263
00:16:06,383 --> 00:16:07,968
Yeah? Well, for me, it hasn't.

264
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:10,012
Will you cut it out
with the cookies? Cholesterol.

265
00:16:10,053 --> 00:16:11,847
One cookie.

266
00:16:12,973 --> 00:16:16,059
Will you look at this?
Lucia's getting so lazy.

267
00:16:16,101 --> 00:16:18,020
She put the bowl away
without drying it.

268
00:16:19,396 --> 00:16:22,191
You know what I'm thinkin'?
It would be good for you.

269
00:16:22,232 --> 00:16:24,985
- Like a life lesson.
- For me?

270
00:16:25,027 --> 00:16:27,362
Yeah... open you up a little bit.

271
00:16:28,906 --> 00:16:30,449
I think it would be fun.

272
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:35,204
I'm sure it would be fun for you.
You'd be having a lot of fun.

273
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:41,585
You're always saying you wanna
do things for the marriage.

274
00:16:41,585 --> 00:16:44,171
Always talking about hobbies
and projects and shit,

275
00:16:44,213 --> 00:16:49,510
that's what this would be.
It would be like a bonding thing.

276
00:16:49,551 --> 00:16:51,512
How stupid do I look to you?

277
00:16:51,553 --> 00:16:54,515
All right, so I took a shot.

278
00:16:54,556 --> 00:16:56,934
How much longer before dinner?
I'm starved.

279
00:16:58,602 --> 00:17:01,230
Looks like you've already
eaten dinner.

280
00:17:01,271 --> 00:17:04,733
I've been married to my husband
for 30 years.

281
00:17:04,775 --> 00:17:09,404
- Wow, that's great.
- It's a miracle...

282
00:17:09,446 --> 00:17:13,867
that in the last 30 years,
I didn't kill him in his sleep.

283
00:17:13,909 --> 00:17:17,079
Jump on a plane,
and not come back.

284
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,957
- How long have you been married?
- Six years.

285
00:17:19,998 --> 00:17:23,460
That's nice.
Gonna have kids?

286
00:17:23,502 --> 00:17:26,213
Yeah, I think we will.

287
00:17:26,255 --> 00:17:28,590
Have all the fun you can
while you can.

288
00:17:28,632 --> 00:17:30,926
Do it now,
get it out of the way.

289
00:17:30,968 --> 00:17:35,848
The spending and traveling
and the nuttiness. Just do it all.

290
00:17:35,889 --> 00:17:38,267
Do it all before the kids come.

291
00:17:38,308 --> 00:17:41,395
After the kids come,
there's no more fun.

292
00:17:41,436 --> 00:17:45,983
- Come on, you love your kids, right?
- Not today.

293
00:17:46,024 --> 00:17:48,318
I don't love anybody today.

294
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:51,822
Except you.
I love my hairdresser.

295
00:17:51,864 --> 00:17:54,074
Oh - oh - oh...!

296
00:18:05,878 --> 00:18:09,173
- Was that okay?
- Yeah, it was. Oh yeah.

297
00:18:09,214 --> 00:18:10,716
Good.

298
00:18:10,757 --> 00:18:14,178
Still is to me,
I gotta tell you, Laura...

299
00:18:14,219 --> 00:18:16,597
I look down and wonder
how I got into bed

300
00:18:16,638 --> 00:18:19,600
with a woman
as good looking as you.

301
00:18:19,641 --> 00:18:21,268
I do.
After all this time,

302
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:26,815
I still think you're going
to look at me and yell for a cop.

303
00:18:26,857 --> 00:18:28,483
Oh, Marty... shut up.

304
00:18:35,032 --> 00:18:37,284
See what I'm saying? We have sex,
what's the first thing you do?

305
00:18:37,326 --> 00:18:40,120
You get up and wash up.
How does that work?

306
00:18:42,706 --> 00:18:45,042
So that's what
you really want, huh?

307
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:47,836
For me to have sex
with you and another woman?

308
00:18:47,878 --> 00:18:51,048
Yeah...

309
00:18:51,089 --> 00:18:54,051
Oh, yeah.
I'd like it a lot.

310
00:18:54,092 --> 00:18:57,763
And you want me to kiss her,
and... you know...

311
00:18:57,804 --> 00:18:59,348
go down on her?

312
00:18:59,389 --> 00:19:03,810
Yeah... I mean,
if you wanted to go down on her.

313
00:19:03,852 --> 00:19:06,355
I don't know.

314
00:19:06,396 --> 00:19:08,106
- I don't know if I could.
- What...?

315
00:19:08,148 --> 00:19:10,192
I do it all the time,
it's not so bad.

316
00:19:10,234 --> 00:19:13,862
Plus, you have...
the home court advantage.

317
00:19:13,904 --> 00:19:16,031
- What's that?
- Home court advantage...

318
00:19:16,073 --> 00:19:17,866
that's what you have.
Think about it.

319
00:19:17,908 --> 00:19:20,661
You're a woman,
you know what's going on down there.

320
00:19:20,702 --> 00:19:23,622
You could do it better
than me your first time out...

321
00:19:23,664 --> 00:19:27,584
on my best night ever.
Which was...

322
00:19:27,584 --> 00:19:31,255
last April, at the cabin.
Rememeber?

323
00:19:31,296 --> 00:19:34,716
You could be better than that.
Better than last me April.

324
00:19:34,758 --> 00:19:38,053
- I could?
- You could, first time out, because...

325
00:19:38,095 --> 00:19:40,389
you have the home court advantage.
That's my theory...

326
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:45,102
on why women are getting
into other women.

327
00:19:45,143 --> 00:19:47,813
- Yeah? What's that theory?
- Human nature.

328
00:19:47,855 --> 00:19:49,731
Everybody likes to do something
that they're good at...

329
00:19:49,773 --> 00:19:53,277
everyone likes to excel.
Women are finding something

330
00:19:53,318 --> 00:19:56,655
that they're really good at,
really easily, really fast.

331
00:19:56,697 --> 00:20:00,159
And they're really enjoying it.
And it's home court advantage.

332
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:06,665
I think you would be somebody
that would benefit from it.

333
00:20:06,707 --> 00:20:10,127
(gargling)

334
00:20:11,545 --> 00:20:14,089
I couldn't do it with a stranger.
I want you to know that.

335
00:20:14,131 --> 00:20:16,300
All right, fine.

336
00:20:16,341 --> 00:20:19,469
And I'm not gonna do it
with Diva, all right?

337
00:20:19,511 --> 00:20:22,264
- Diva?
- You do not get to screw Diva.

338
00:20:22,306 --> 00:20:25,642
Fine. Diva's off the list.
Forget Diva.

339
00:20:25,684 --> 00:20:28,020
I love the fact
we're having this conversation.

340
00:20:28,061 --> 00:20:31,732
- I bet you do.
- What about Didi at your salon?

341
00:20:31,773 --> 00:20:34,902
Come on, Marty,
I have to work with her.

342
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:38,906
Part time. You work with her
part time. She's perfect.

343
00:20:38,989 --> 00:20:41,575
You don't want it
to be a stranger.

344
00:20:41,617 --> 00:20:44,203
We know her but
we don't really know her.

345
00:20:44,244 --> 00:20:47,581
She's cute, too,
in her way, and...

346
00:20:47,623 --> 00:20:50,334
you know she's into
this kinda thing, so...

347
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:53,587
I like Didi.
I think she's sweet.

348
00:20:53,629 --> 00:20:57,883
I like Didi, too.
Put Didi at the top of the list.

349
00:20:57,925 --> 00:21:00,260
Operation Didi.

350
00:21:00,302 --> 00:21:02,429
Call her up,
have her for dinner.

351
00:21:02,471 --> 00:21:04,598
If it works out, great.

352
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,558
If it doesn't,
I'll do the dishes.

353
00:21:13,857 --> 00:21:15,817
(doorbell chimes)

354
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:24,743
- Hi...!
- Hi, Didi.

355
00:21:24,785 --> 00:21:27,246
- How are you?
- Good. Come on in.

356
00:21:34,127 --> 00:21:36,713
You did these?

357
00:21:36,755 --> 00:21:38,757
Yeah, I did.

358
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:42,886
God...
Laura, they're wonderful.

359
00:21:42,928 --> 00:21:45,722
Thank you.

360
00:21:45,764 --> 00:21:47,432
Do you like my perfume?

361
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:49,935
Roses.

362
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,105
Yeah.

363
00:21:56,984 --> 00:21:59,236
Marty...?

364
00:22:03,574 --> 00:22:07,703
Didi... it's great
that you finally came over,

365
00:22:07,744 --> 00:22:12,416
because Laura's wanted to have you
for dinner for the longest time.

366
00:22:12,457 --> 00:22:16,211
You know, I don't think we need
any more wine. Drunk...

367
00:22:16,253 --> 00:22:19,506
- Drinks.
- Drinks...? Oh, drunk.

368
00:22:19,548 --> 00:22:21,675
- Let's get drunk.
- Drunk, let's get drunk.

369
00:22:21,717 --> 00:22:24,595
Hard drinks.
I got a big jug of rum,

370
00:22:24,595 --> 00:22:27,347
- does that sound good?
- I love rum. Rum and coke.

371
00:22:27,389 --> 00:22:29,933
I'm dangerous on rum and coke.

372
00:22:29,975 --> 00:22:32,269
We have a winner.
It's rum and coke.

373
00:22:32,311 --> 00:22:35,314
You hear that? She's dangerous
on rum and coke, this one.

374
00:22:35,355 --> 00:22:38,901
- Is he always this funny?
- Not always.

375
00:22:38,942 --> 00:22:41,445
Where you from, Dee?
Chicago or something?

376
00:22:41,445 --> 00:22:45,741
- I'm from all over.
- All over? Wow.

377
00:22:45,782 --> 00:22:48,577
Yep. I'm an Army brat.

378
00:22:48,619 --> 00:22:53,457
An Army brat? That is intense.
Tell us about it.

379
00:22:53,499 --> 00:22:57,377
I lived with my dad
until I was 14.

380
00:22:57,419 --> 00:23:00,964
Then out of nowhere,
I met my mom and I lived with her...

381
00:23:01,006 --> 00:23:03,717
until we decided
that we hated each other.

382
00:23:03,759 --> 00:23:09,973
Then I hitchhiked around
a little while, until I was 17

383
00:23:10,015 --> 00:23:13,936
and I met this woman
I lived with in Florida,

384
00:23:13,977 --> 00:23:17,606
but... it didn't really work out,

385
00:23:17,648 --> 00:23:20,817
because she was sorta
in love with me...

386
00:23:20,859 --> 00:23:23,612
I guess, to be honest,
I just enjoyed fucking her...

387
00:23:23,654 --> 00:23:25,531
(crash)

388
00:23:32,037 --> 00:23:33,455
Let me tell you this story...

389
00:23:33,497 --> 00:23:35,999
This is so nice out here.

390
00:23:38,168 --> 00:23:40,671
(reggae music plays softly)

391
00:23:47,344 --> 00:23:50,055
Wow, Didi, you should be
a professional dancer.

392
00:23:50,097 --> 00:23:51,598
She should.

393
00:23:52,933 --> 00:23:55,477
Doesn't anybody
wanna dance with me?

394
00:23:55,519 --> 00:23:57,271
All right, I'll dance.

395
00:24:00,023 --> 00:24:01,692
Oh yeah... Oh, baby...

396
00:24:06,822 --> 00:24:08,907
You're scaring me now.

397
00:24:10,242 --> 00:24:12,452
Laura, come up here.
Look at this.

398
00:24:12,494 --> 00:24:14,538
Laura, come dance with me.

399
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:16,456
Come on... come on.

400
00:24:20,043 --> 00:24:25,674
Laura wanted to dance.
Didi wants to dance tonight.

401
00:24:25,716 --> 00:24:28,468
I wanna dance so bad...

402
00:24:29,553 --> 00:24:31,847
(music continues)

403
00:25:16,934 --> 00:25:21,563
Didi, just stay there. I need Marty
to help me with something...

404
00:25:21,605 --> 00:25:23,732
Marty...!

405
00:25:27,611 --> 00:25:28,904
What's up? Havin' fun?

406
00:25:28,946 --> 00:25:31,698
- No, honey, no.
- Yes.

407
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:35,577
I think this might be a mistake.
We should call it a night.

408
00:25:35,619 --> 00:25:39,498
Call it a night? No,
we don't wanna call it a night.

409
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:42,501
Are you kidding me?
We're havin' fun.

410
00:25:42,543 --> 00:25:45,754
- We are?
- Yes. She's hot for you, this girl.

411
00:25:45,796 --> 00:25:48,590
Oh, God. I know, I know...

412
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:52,553
Are you sure this is what
you really want?

413
00:25:52,594 --> 00:25:54,721
Let me think for a millionth
of a second...

414
00:25:54,763 --> 00:25:56,807
Yes. Are you kiddin'?

415
00:25:56,849 --> 00:25:59,685
We're having fun.
We're having a good time.

416
00:25:59,726 --> 00:26:03,730
- You okay?
- Just fill this up.

417
00:26:03,772 --> 00:26:06,900
(Didi:)
Is it okay if I go swimming?

418
00:26:06,942 --> 00:26:09,903
Yes... go swimming,
are you kidding?

419
00:26:09,987 --> 00:26:12,489
Our poolo es su poolo.

420
00:26:12,531 --> 00:26:14,700
(Didi:)
Laura, is he always so funny?

421
00:26:14,741 --> 00:26:16,618
Ohh, yeah...

422
00:26:18,328 --> 00:26:21,081
So we got...

423
00:26:21,123 --> 00:26:23,208
we got a little booze here.

424
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:26,962
- Are you coming in?
- Coming in...?

425
00:26:27,004 --> 00:26:29,256
- Ohh...!
- Yeah.

426
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:34,553
I think we should go in.

427
00:26:34,595 --> 00:26:36,597
I'm gonna get a swimsuit.

428
00:26:37,014 --> 00:26:40,017
And so are you.
Come on.

429
00:26:40,058 --> 00:26:42,352
We're gonna get a swimsuit...

430
00:26:42,394 --> 00:26:45,230
and you...
just trawl around.

431
00:26:50,194 --> 00:26:53,655
- Hello.
- Hello.

432
00:26:57,326 --> 00:26:59,161
Hello.

433
00:27:07,169 --> 00:27:11,882
Hey... hey...
hello.

434
00:27:11,924 --> 00:27:14,843
Take you for a ride.
Can I borrow my wife?

435
00:27:26,146 --> 00:27:28,649
(Didi:)
That looks like fun.

436
00:27:30,067 --> 00:27:33,070
- I want one.
- Want a ride?

437
00:27:37,699 --> 00:27:39,993
Okay, we'll give you a ride.

438
00:27:45,958 --> 00:27:50,337
I'll put you up here.
You can nurse your drink...

439
00:27:50,379 --> 00:27:53,382
We know what your
priorities are tonight.

440
00:27:53,423 --> 00:27:56,927
Didi, you...
oh, Didi...!

441
00:28:05,435 --> 00:28:07,062
(giggling)

442
00:28:10,148 --> 00:28:13,610
Take me back to Laura.
I want one from Laura.

443
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:15,529
You want a ride from Laura?

444
00:28:42,139 --> 00:28:43,765
What...?

445
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:48,103
Laura, what...?

446
00:29:00,991 --> 00:29:04,620
Hey... what happened?
What happened down there, sweetie?

447
00:29:04,661 --> 00:29:08,832
I don't know...
It just got too real or something.

448
00:29:11,001 --> 00:29:13,128
I don't know. I felt stupid.

449
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:17,591
Hey... you're not stupid.
You're not.

450
00:29:17,674 --> 00:29:20,469
I'm the stupid one.
This was a mistake.

451
00:29:20,511 --> 00:29:23,013
This was a mistake. I'm sorry.

452
00:29:23,013 --> 00:29:25,766
That's okay.

453
00:29:25,807 --> 00:29:27,100
(knocking)

454
00:29:28,769 --> 00:29:31,021
I'll send her home.
I'll say goodnight.

455
00:29:31,063 --> 00:29:34,316
No, I'll talk to her.
Let me talk to her.

456
00:29:38,028 --> 00:29:40,948
- Hey...
- Hi.

457
00:29:40,989 --> 00:29:44,827
I'm sorry if I did anything
to make you feel badly.

458
00:29:44,868 --> 00:29:47,871
You both made me
feel really comfortable,

459
00:29:47,913 --> 00:29:54,086
and I haven't felt comfortable
around anyone for a long time.

460
00:29:54,127 --> 00:29:57,798
God... you're just
so beautiful...

461
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,259
and great...

462
00:30:02,636 --> 00:30:05,055
Should I go home?

463
00:30:09,142 --> 00:30:11,520
Can I come in, then?

464
00:30:14,439 --> 00:30:17,317
Yeah, you can come in.

465
00:31:58,210 --> 00:32:00,796
(moaning and rattling)

466
00:32:27,531 --> 00:32:30,033
You guys wanna knock off
and go get a drink?

467
00:32:30,075 --> 00:32:32,035
(moaning continues)

468
00:32:38,709 --> 00:32:42,004
Wow... that's what that flap is for.

469
00:32:47,885 --> 00:32:52,014
Don't worry about me...
I'll be back.

470
00:32:52,055 --> 00:32:54,099
I'll go downstairs
and get a drink, okay?

471
00:32:54,141 --> 00:33:00,022
Get a drink...
do a couple hundred push-ups.

472
00:33:00,063 --> 00:33:02,191
(moaning increases)

473
00:33:27,966 --> 00:33:30,219
Murphy... can't tell Murphy.
Damn, damn...

474
00:33:36,433 --> 00:33:39,394
(line ringing)

475
00:33:39,436 --> 00:33:40,562
Hi.

476
00:33:42,773 --> 00:33:45,484
You're not gonna believe this.

477
00:33:45,526 --> 00:33:50,572
My wife, right now,
is upstairs - in my bedroom...

478
00:33:50,614 --> 00:33:54,201
with little Didi...

479
00:33:54,243 --> 00:33:56,411
the hottie at work...

480
00:33:56,453 --> 00:33:59,581
and the two of them
are tearing into each other...

481
00:33:59,623 --> 00:34:03,836
like there's no tomorrow...
Yeah, yeah, it gets better.

482
00:34:03,877 --> 00:34:05,629
I'm up there.
I'm part of the package.

483
00:34:05,671 --> 00:34:08,048
Yeah - no,
I'm just taking a break.

484
00:34:09,091 --> 00:34:11,885
What...? No.

485
00:34:11,927 --> 00:34:14,304
I don't wanna order a pizza.
I was just calling.

486
00:34:14,346 --> 00:34:16,223
I had to tell someone.

487
00:34:23,856 --> 00:34:26,108
(moaning continues)

488
00:34:30,529 --> 00:34:32,364
Hey, you guys...

489
00:34:36,618 --> 00:34:38,078
Marty's back.

490
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,788
Hey, honey...

491
00:34:49,256 --> 00:34:52,092
Oh, shit. Damn.

492
00:34:57,347 --> 00:34:59,224
Hey... Hi.

493
00:34:59,266 --> 00:35:01,435
Hi.

494
00:35:01,476 --> 00:35:04,563
- Bye.
- You leaving?

495
00:35:05,689 --> 00:35:08,192
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

496
00:35:08,233 --> 00:35:11,278
You too...
I mean, bye.

497
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:13,780
Thank you. See ya.

498
00:35:13,864 --> 00:35:15,616
Bye.

499
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:20,829
Hey.

500
00:35:21,955 --> 00:35:24,041
- How you doin'?
- Did you sleep well?

501
00:35:24,082 --> 00:35:26,460
I did. How about you?

502
00:35:26,502 --> 00:35:29,963
I had a good sleep.
I feel so rested.

503
00:35:31,673 --> 00:35:34,676
You okay? Everything okay
with last night?

504
00:35:34,718 --> 00:35:37,137
I'm okay. Are you okay?

505
00:35:37,179 --> 00:35:41,850
Me? I'm very okay.
Especially if you're okay.

506
00:35:41,892 --> 00:35:43,894
Oh, yeah, I am, I am.

507
00:35:43,936 --> 00:35:47,356
You know what last night was?
I think it was educational.

508
00:35:47,397 --> 00:35:52,194
Educational? I love to hear you
use the word educational.

509
00:35:52,236 --> 00:35:55,364
That's great. You see?
You were worried.

510
00:35:55,405 --> 00:35:57,407
And now, you're educated.

511
00:35:57,449 --> 00:35:59,743
Oh, yeah.

512
00:35:59,785 --> 00:36:03,121
Do you want some breakfast?
I'm going to have a giant breakfast.

513
00:36:04,414 --> 00:36:10,128
So everything's okay, seriously?
No weirdness...

514
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:13,048
Oh, no, I'm cool.

515
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:16,093
Now I know what you mean by
the "home court advantage" thing.

516
00:36:16,134 --> 00:36:17,803
Wow.

517
00:36:17,845 --> 00:36:18,428
(Radio:)
Wow.

518
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:20,013
My scene is done actually
at my apartment.

519
00:36:20,055 --> 00:36:22,432
- Your actual apartment?
- On my fire escape.

520
00:36:22,474 --> 00:36:24,893
I have another scene,
a lesbian scene...

521
00:36:24,935 --> 00:36:26,186
- Really?
- Which you will love.

522
00:36:26,228 --> 00:36:27,563
Oh, I most certainly will.

523
00:36:27,604 --> 00:36:30,899
- Girls.
- Have you been out to the site yet?

524
00:36:30,941 --> 00:36:33,569
No, I have not been to the site.

525
00:36:33,610 --> 00:36:36,738
Just want to know if you saw
the changes in the kitchen plan.

526
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:39,575
- No, I haven't seen them.
- I know what you're gonna say...

527
00:36:39,616 --> 00:36:41,994
You're gonna say it costs too much.
I've been thinking about it...

528
00:36:42,035 --> 00:36:44,037
and it ain't all about money.

529
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:45,622
You don't know
what I'm gonna say,

530
00:36:45,664 --> 00:36:47,749
'cause that's not what I was
gonna say, 'cause you're right.

531
00:36:47,791 --> 00:36:49,918
It ain't all about money.

532
00:36:50,794 --> 00:36:54,047
What's your deal?
Fighting with your wife again?

533
00:36:54,089 --> 00:36:57,050
She has burrowed her way
up inside my asshole.

534
00:36:57,134 --> 00:36:59,094
Being married is very tough.

535
00:36:59,136 --> 00:37:01,471
Yes, but it's only as tough
as you make it.

536
00:37:01,513 --> 00:37:03,974
It's only as tough as you make it.

537
00:37:04,016 --> 00:37:06,435
Know why you guys
are having trouble at home?

538
00:37:06,476 --> 00:37:08,896
- You wanna know?
- Why?

539
00:37:08,937 --> 00:37:12,107
- You're not shakin' it up.
- Excuse me?

540
00:37:12,149 --> 00:37:15,569
That's all we're talking about here.
Shake it up.

541
00:37:15,611 --> 00:37:19,573
- Shake it up?
- Yes. Shake it up.

542
00:37:19,656 --> 00:37:22,075
You're the man.
That's your responsibility.

543
00:37:22,117 --> 00:37:26,079
The women wanna be led.
They wanna be taught new tricks.

544
00:37:26,121 --> 00:37:28,081
They wanna be shaken up.

545
00:37:28,165 --> 00:37:30,792
What the fuck
are you talking about?

546
00:37:30,834 --> 00:37:34,296
I'm talking about you,
going home...

547
00:37:34,338 --> 00:37:36,465
and you, going home...

548
00:37:36,507 --> 00:37:40,052
and teaching your wife
a couple of new tricks.

549
00:37:40,093 --> 00:37:43,847
You will find the picture
changes very quickly.

550
00:37:46,558 --> 00:37:48,477
Shake it up, boys.

551
00:38:34,565 --> 00:38:36,400
(doorbell rings)

552
00:38:36,441 --> 00:38:39,278
- Who's that?
- I don't know.

553
00:38:39,319 --> 00:38:40,904
Why don't you go see?

554
00:38:47,244 --> 00:38:49,705
(doorbell rings)

555
00:39:00,382 --> 00:39:03,051
- It's Didi.
- Didi?

556
00:39:03,093 --> 00:39:04,928
I wonder who called her?

557
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,560
(yelping and banging)

558
00:39:22,279 --> 00:39:25,824
You two are on fire tonight.
Look at you.

559
00:39:28,702 --> 00:39:33,707
Babe...? You okay?
Do you want to rest for a minute?

560
00:39:36,126 --> 00:39:38,545
Can I talk to you for a minute?

561
00:39:38,587 --> 00:39:41,381
Yeah, honey?

562
00:39:41,423 --> 00:39:43,258
Are you okay?

563
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:45,052
Yeah, I'm fine.

564
00:39:45,093 --> 00:39:48,138
For a minute, I thought
you were having trouble breathing.

565
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:50,933
- No...
- Don't stop.

566
00:39:52,935 --> 00:39:55,854
(moaning resumes)

567
00:40:07,491 --> 00:40:09,535
(cries and thumping)

568
00:40:20,295 --> 00:40:21,964
Hey.

569
00:40:29,263 --> 00:40:31,223
Hey, you guys...

570
00:40:33,308 --> 00:40:36,061
Hey... hey, Didi...

571
00:40:37,771 --> 00:40:40,023
Hi.

572
00:40:40,065 --> 00:40:42,359
- Guys having fun?
- Yeah.

573
00:40:44,278 --> 00:40:45,988
Want me to bring up sandwiches?

574
00:40:46,029 --> 00:40:49,199
Don't stop, don't stop.

575
00:40:49,241 --> 00:40:51,660
(moans resume)

576
00:40:56,623 --> 00:40:58,834
(Ioud cries and bumping)

577
00:41:25,152 --> 00:41:27,404
Bye, Marty. See ya.

578
00:41:29,490 --> 00:41:31,116
Bye.

579
00:41:31,909 --> 00:41:34,369
"Bye, Marty. See ya."

580
00:41:34,411 --> 00:41:36,330
(Radio:)
You wanna stand up for us?

581
00:41:36,371 --> 00:41:40,209
Oh, please do.
You are a hottie.

582
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:41,835
Are you very proud
of yourself naked?

583
00:41:41,877 --> 00:41:43,545
I wouldn't say "proud",
just comfortable.

584
00:41:43,587 --> 00:41:45,380
- Have you ever done lesbianism?
- No...

585
00:41:50,093 --> 00:41:51,762
- Hi.
- Diva.

586
00:41:51,803 --> 00:41:53,555
What are you doing here?

587
00:41:53,597 --> 00:41:55,182
The Pembrokes are coming over.

588
00:41:55,224 --> 00:41:57,100
Laura called and asked me
to help with the big brunch.

589
00:41:57,142 --> 00:42:00,395
- You didn't know about it?
- No... Laura called you?

590
00:42:00,437 --> 00:42:02,814
I though it was a great idea.
Hi!

591
00:42:02,856 --> 00:42:06,151
- You look great.
- Look at you, you look fabulous.

592
00:42:06,193 --> 00:42:07,528
Come on in.

593
00:42:14,451 --> 00:42:17,204
- Marty, how are ya?
- Hi, Marty.

594
00:42:17,246 --> 00:42:20,624
Dave, Evie, how are you guys?
Good to see you.

595
00:42:23,627 --> 00:42:25,879
You look amazing.
Look at you.

596
00:42:25,921 --> 00:42:28,257
Both of you. You look great.

597
00:42:28,298 --> 00:42:30,509
I'm not feeling too great.
My wife beat me at tennis.

598
00:42:30,551 --> 00:42:33,971
You look great. This guy
looks 22 years old...

599
00:42:34,012 --> 00:42:36,849
like he did in Michigan,
this guy.

600
00:42:36,890 --> 00:42:38,851
Marty, your wife looks adorable.

601
00:42:38,892 --> 00:42:42,646
Thank you. She is adorable,
but look at this guy.

602
00:42:42,688 --> 00:42:45,440
Both of you look fantastic.

603
00:42:45,482 --> 00:42:49,361
That's it. We're in trouble.
Way too many "you look greats".

604
00:42:49,403 --> 00:42:52,239
Marty, get me a drink.
I wanna be good and hammered

605
00:42:52,281 --> 00:42:54,158
when you start slamming me
for that loan.

606
00:42:54,199 --> 00:42:56,952
Oh, come on. That's not
what this is about.

607
00:42:56,994 --> 00:42:59,538
I want you to have a nice
Sunday brunch with us.

608
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:02,416
Marty, get the "great-Iookin' guy"
a drink, will ya?

609
00:43:02,457 --> 00:43:04,710
Fine. How about you, Evie?
You need to get hammered?

610
00:43:04,751 --> 00:43:06,920
- A Bloody Mary, sweetie.
- Comin' right up.

611
00:43:06,962 --> 00:43:09,173
I'll get one too.
We'll all get slammed.

612
00:43:11,008 --> 00:43:13,218
- Look overdone to you?
- I'm not eating that.

613
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:17,014
You know, Diva,
you look really beautiful today.

614
00:43:18,307 --> 00:43:20,642
Thank you, Laura.
So do you.

615
00:43:22,603 --> 00:43:24,688
I love your hair.

616
00:43:26,398 --> 00:43:28,442
I like your hair.

617
00:43:32,696 --> 00:43:34,490
What is that scent?

618
00:43:35,407 --> 00:43:37,159
Do you like it?

619
00:43:38,035 --> 00:43:39,995
Oh, yeah...

620
00:43:40,037 --> 00:43:41,914
I like it.

621
00:43:46,126 --> 00:43:48,045
I'll take those.

622
00:43:51,256 --> 00:43:53,175
You remember Dave Pembroke?

623
00:43:53,217 --> 00:43:56,345
- I remember...
- His wife, Evie,

624
00:43:56,386 --> 00:43:58,013
Billy's wife, Carol...

625
00:43:58,055 --> 00:43:59,598
(exchanging greetings)

626
00:44:01,475 --> 00:44:03,477
No, Billy, we're gonna put
you in the middle.

627
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:04,561
Billy sits here.

628
00:44:04,603 --> 00:44:06,146
Billy will be in the middle.

629
00:44:06,188 --> 00:44:08,690
- Don't fight over me.
- And I'll put Diva right here.

630
00:44:08,732 --> 00:44:11,026
- It's fine, honey.
- I'll get another chair.

631
00:44:11,068 --> 00:44:13,612
Thank you. Come on,
you sit here.

632
00:44:17,407 --> 00:44:20,244
Just want you to know
who runs this house...

633
00:44:20,285 --> 00:44:22,371
Laura.

634
00:44:23,997 --> 00:44:25,374
It's good to see you, man.

635
00:44:25,415 --> 00:44:28,669
Good to see you, too.
I remember your older brother.

636
00:44:28,710 --> 00:44:31,672
Oh, Jesus.
Are you still kickin' ass?

637
00:44:31,713 --> 00:44:34,550
I remember when you and he
took on the Statler twins...

638
00:44:37,427 --> 00:44:38,846
Sausage?

639
00:44:40,013 --> 00:44:41,849
No.

640
00:44:41,890 --> 00:44:45,310
Let's hope marriage and California
have settled him down.

641
00:44:45,352 --> 00:44:50,357
He's settled down.
He's just a big pushover now.

642
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:52,860
Somehow, Evie,
I kinda doubt that...

643
00:44:53,235 --> 00:44:56,822
(Billy:)
Marty tells me you're doing good.

644
00:44:56,864 --> 00:44:59,241
(Marty:)
Good? He's got 18 furniture stores...

645
00:44:59,283 --> 00:45:03,328
Excuse me...
I'm gonna help Lucia in the kitchen.

646
00:45:03,370 --> 00:45:05,789
Okay, help Lucia in the kitchen.

647
00:45:08,083 --> 00:45:10,252
Billy... you need a place setting.

648
00:45:10,294 --> 00:45:12,379
Lucia will get it.
Lucia...!

649
00:45:12,421 --> 00:45:13,881
That's okay...

650
00:45:13,964 --> 00:45:15,757
- Laura, sit down, please...
- It's fine...

651
00:45:15,799 --> 00:45:19,595
I know exactly where it is.
I'm gonna go help Diva.

652
00:45:19,636 --> 00:45:22,097
I don't want your food to get cold.
It's the Pembrokes...

653
00:45:22,139 --> 00:45:24,600
I'm gonna go help Diva, okay?

654
00:45:28,478 --> 00:45:30,314
Careful with the butter.

655
00:45:33,650 --> 00:45:36,153
Diva, I am so sorry.

656
00:45:36,195 --> 00:45:38,447
I really am sorry.
I don't know what's gotten into me...

657
00:45:38,489 --> 00:45:40,449
I feel like a pig.

658
00:45:40,491 --> 00:45:42,326
What is going on?

659
00:45:44,995 --> 00:45:49,291
Marty told me this thing
about you in college, seeing girls,

660
00:45:49,333 --> 00:45:54,171
ever since he told me,
I can't get it or you out of my mind.

661
00:45:54,213 --> 00:45:56,256
You know I'm getting married
in two months, right?

662
00:45:56,340 --> 00:45:58,675
- Yes, I do.
- You do?

663
00:45:58,717 --> 00:46:01,970
I do. Like I said before,
I'm sorry.

664
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:07,935
- I'm just so attracted to you.
- Laura...!

665
00:46:07,976 --> 00:46:11,313
You ever see
the Statler Twins, Dave?

666
00:46:11,355 --> 00:46:15,108
Do I see them? No.
They still live back in Michigan.

667
00:46:15,901 --> 00:46:17,986
You ever see any
of the guys you beat up?

668
00:46:18,028 --> 00:46:19,738
Just curious.

669
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:22,115
First of all, I didn't beat
that many guys up.

670
00:46:22,157 --> 00:46:23,992
Second of all, no...

671
00:46:24,034 --> 00:46:26,870
I left Michigan after high school,
and I haven't been back.

672
00:46:26,912 --> 00:46:28,747
Must be kinda weird
to run into somebody

673
00:46:28,789 --> 00:46:31,792
20 years after you beat 'em up.
Remember me?

674
00:46:31,875 --> 00:46:35,212
You broke my clavicle?
You look good.

675
00:46:35,254 --> 00:46:39,675
I'm sorry, Diva.
I'm really sorry.

676
00:46:39,716 --> 00:46:43,220
You should be.
I'm really not into women.

677
00:46:44,721 --> 00:46:46,473
Me neither.

678
00:47:01,405 --> 00:47:04,616
Oh, my God... Oh, my God.

679
00:47:04,658 --> 00:47:07,327
Oh, my God... okay.

680
00:47:09,121 --> 00:47:11,957
Laura, I'm gonna go.

681
00:47:11,999 --> 00:47:14,960
I think that's the best thing
in this situation.

682
00:47:15,002 --> 00:47:19,214
I'm gonna go.
I'm straight... I am.

683
00:47:19,256 --> 00:47:22,384
I'm straight... I am.

684
00:47:22,426 --> 00:47:26,889
What we're talking about,
we have ten lots we can obtain.

685
00:47:26,930 --> 00:47:31,059
These houses finished
are at a million, million two...

686
00:47:31,101 --> 00:47:34,188
We have seven, seven and a quarter
in some of the houses.

687
00:47:34,229 --> 00:47:36,690
Okay, I'm gonna say goodbye.

688
00:47:36,773 --> 00:47:38,233
Something wrong, Diva?

689
00:47:38,275 --> 00:47:40,402
No...

690
00:47:40,444 --> 00:47:42,571
I gotta be somewhere,
I'm running really straight...

691
00:47:42,613 --> 00:47:46,742
late... I'm running really late.
I'm gonna go.

692
00:47:50,412 --> 00:47:53,081
Just stay awhile.
Marty...?

693
00:47:53,415 --> 00:47:54,875
Tell Diva not to go.

694
00:47:54,917 --> 00:47:59,254
Diva, don't go
Bye...

695
00:47:59,296 --> 00:48:01,340
No... don't.
Please stay.

696
00:48:01,381 --> 00:48:03,592
Laura, I have to go now.

697
00:48:03,634 --> 00:48:05,302
Let me walk you to the door.

698
00:48:05,344 --> 00:48:07,930
I know where the door is.

699
00:48:07,971 --> 00:48:11,642
I'll walk her to the door.

700
00:48:11,683 --> 00:48:15,312
- I'm sorry.
- Honey, don't be silly.

701
00:48:15,354 --> 00:48:17,856
Really...
You've got guests...

702
00:48:17,898 --> 00:48:19,983
I'll walk her to the door.

703
00:48:20,025 --> 00:48:21,944
You're in the middle
of important business...

704
00:48:21,985 --> 00:48:24,780
I'll walk her to the door.
Can I talk to you?

705
00:48:24,822 --> 00:48:28,575
Diva, don't go anywhere.
Please.

706
00:48:28,617 --> 00:48:30,118
I just wanna talk to you
before you go.

707
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:32,329
I won't go.

708
00:48:32,371 --> 00:48:34,164
Promise me you won't go.

709
00:48:34,206 --> 00:48:36,083
Let me hold your purse.

710
00:48:37,167 --> 00:48:39,795
- One minute... be right back.
- Don't go, babe.

711
00:48:44,383 --> 00:48:47,511
- What's going on!?
- Nothing.

712
00:48:47,553 --> 00:48:50,138
- I just want her to stay.
- You want Diva to stay?

713
00:48:50,180 --> 00:48:52,933
I want us both
to be with her tonight.

714
00:48:52,975 --> 00:48:55,394
You want us to be with Diva?

715
00:48:55,435 --> 00:48:57,688
Are you crazy?
Do you have any idea...

716
00:48:57,729 --> 00:49:01,150
how important this brunch is to me?
You've got to know.

717
00:49:01,191 --> 00:49:03,944
You've got to admit
that she is foxy.

718
00:49:03,986 --> 00:49:07,781
She's foxy? What are you,
K.D. Lang? Are you out of your mind?

719
00:49:07,823 --> 00:49:11,577
This will be good for us.
I just want you to be happy...

720
00:49:11,618 --> 00:49:13,829
Don't touch me.
You want me to be happy?

721
00:49:13,871 --> 00:49:15,747
- Yes.
- Good. Listen...

722
00:49:15,789 --> 00:49:18,834
Let her go home,
and you snap out of it.

723
00:49:18,876 --> 00:49:22,504
Honey, I know you think
she 's fine.

724
00:49:22,546 --> 00:49:26,175
You're being a nutcase.
Snap out of it.

725
00:49:29,678 --> 00:49:31,805
Billy, can you get Laura a bagel?

726
00:49:31,847 --> 00:49:32,514
I'm gonna walk Diva to the door.

727
00:49:32,556 --> 00:49:34,600
I'm gonna walk Diva... I...

728
00:49:40,856 --> 00:49:42,524
- Go sit down.
- You let me in!

729
00:49:42,566 --> 00:49:44,401
Sit the fuck down!

730
00:49:44,443 --> 00:49:45,986
(snarling)

731
00:49:46,069 --> 00:49:48,113
Go...!

732
00:49:54,411 --> 00:49:57,456
- What's going on?
- Nothing...

733
00:49:57,498 --> 00:49:59,666
Marty... did you ask your wife
to hit on me?

734
00:49:59,708 --> 00:50:02,961
- No...!
- Is that what's going on?

735
00:50:03,003 --> 00:50:05,881
Why would I do that?
What am I, a deviate?

736
00:50:05,923 --> 00:50:07,466
Why would I ask my wife
to hit on a woman...?

737
00:50:07,508 --> 00:50:10,302
Because she just did.
She hit on me big time.

738
00:50:10,344 --> 00:50:13,096
Okay, so why do I get blamed?
I had nothing to do with it.

739
00:50:13,138 --> 00:50:15,057
She did it on her own.

740
00:50:16,892 --> 00:50:19,728
- She did it on her own?
- Yes. She's going through something.

741
00:50:19,770 --> 00:50:20,813
She's going throught something?

742
00:50:20,854 --> 00:50:22,314
She's having a breakdown or something.

743
00:50:22,356 --> 00:50:24,733
- A breakdown?
- It's not a big deal.

744
00:50:24,775 --> 00:50:26,318
I'm just gonna say goodbye.

745
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:28,028
- I think I'm gonna talk to her...
- No...

746
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:31,532
Diva, no. Just gonna say goodbye.
Thank you... Agggh!

747
00:50:31,573 --> 00:50:33,033
Didi!?

748
00:50:33,116 --> 00:50:34,993
I don't need to talk to you.
I need to see Laura.

749
00:50:35,035 --> 00:50:36,203
No, wait, Didi...!

750
00:50:36,245 --> 00:50:40,082
Gotta make sure we own
or have the rights to the lots...

751
00:50:40,123 --> 00:50:41,375
Wait...!

752
00:50:41,959 --> 00:50:46,964
Hi, Laura.
I need to show you something.

753
00:50:47,005 --> 00:50:49,049
I'm sorry to barge in...
Hi...

754
00:50:49,091 --> 00:50:51,677
- Hi, I'm Didi.
- This is Didi.

755
00:50:51,718 --> 00:50:54,221
Dave and Evie Pembroke.
Billy and Carol you know.

756
00:50:54,304 --> 00:50:55,973
This is our friend, Didi...

757
00:50:56,014 --> 00:51:01,270
who forgot her purse
and has now located it.

758
00:51:01,311 --> 00:51:03,605
I'm gonna walk her to the door.

759
00:51:05,482 --> 00:51:10,279
This is a brochure on an arts fair
and sympo-see-um in Monterrey.

760
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:13,157
A symposium?

761
00:51:13,198 --> 00:51:16,743
Dave, I'll be with you
in a minute...

762
00:51:16,785 --> 00:51:18,579
Say goodbye, okay?

763
00:51:18,620 --> 00:51:20,956
Let go of my...
you're being an asshole.

764
00:51:20,998 --> 00:51:23,458
I'm not being an asshole...

765
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:25,919
Let go of me, pen dick.

766
00:51:25,961 --> 00:51:27,796
Join us, Didi.

767
00:51:27,838 --> 00:51:30,215
Honey, join us...?

768
00:51:30,257 --> 00:51:32,593
I don't understand
why you're so upset.

769
00:51:32,634 --> 00:51:34,845
You're the one that wanted me
to sleep with her.

770
00:51:34,887 --> 00:51:38,891
Why am I so upset?
Because I think you single-handedly

771
00:51:38,932 --> 00:51:41,810
blew the Pembroke deal, Laura.
That's why I'm so upset.

772
00:51:41,852 --> 00:51:45,814
I don't know what's gotten into you.
Honestly, I don't know.

773
00:51:45,856 --> 00:51:47,399
What do you mean,
what has gotten into me?

774
00:51:47,441 --> 00:51:49,568
Are you gay?
Are you gay now?

775
00:51:49,610 --> 00:51:52,362
No, I am not gay...

776
00:51:52,404 --> 00:51:54,406
Are you bi?

777
00:51:54,448 --> 00:51:59,786
No... I don't know...
I thought I knew, but now I don't.

778
00:52:01,914 --> 00:52:04,374
I was watching some
of your moves the other night...

779
00:52:04,416 --> 00:52:06,460
It was like watching
an old pro work.

780
00:52:06,543 --> 00:52:09,421
I thought I was at a Pavarotti
concert for a minute.

781
00:52:09,463 --> 00:52:12,466
Have you been with Didi before?
Tell the truth.

782
00:52:12,549 --> 00:52:15,802
No, I haven't.
I haven't been with Didi before.

783
00:52:17,095 --> 00:52:21,183
Before two weeks ago,
I had never slept with a woman.

784
00:52:21,225 --> 00:52:22,768
That's the truth.

785
00:52:22,809 --> 00:52:25,312
You wouldn't know that
by watchin' you work.

786
00:52:26,396 --> 00:52:30,317
I know that...
I know that, because...

787
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:33,737
It's... you know what it is?
That "home court advantage" thing...

788
00:52:33,779 --> 00:52:38,742
I knew... you were gonna say that.
Know how I knew?

789
00:52:38,784 --> 00:52:42,454
Ask me...
you know how I knew?

790
00:52:42,496 --> 00:52:43,705
How do you know, Marty?

791
00:52:43,747 --> 00:52:46,375
Because I made the "home court
advantage" thing up.

792
00:52:46,416 --> 00:52:48,043
It's bullshit, and I made it up.

793
00:52:48,085 --> 00:52:50,045
- But it's true. It is true...
- No, it's bullshit...

794
00:52:50,087 --> 00:52:52,297
Don't bullshit a bullshit artist.

795
00:52:52,339 --> 00:52:54,550
I'm telling you, it's true.

796
00:52:54,591 --> 00:52:57,678
It was like I knew exactly
what to do to please Didi,

797
00:52:57,761 --> 00:53:01,431
And it was so... my God,
it was so powerful,

798
00:53:01,473 --> 00:53:05,227
and it was nice, then - God -
she did these things to me,

799
00:53:05,269 --> 00:53:08,397
and I thought I was
just gonna melt and gyrate...

800
00:53:08,438 --> 00:53:11,525
I was there. I don't need to hear
the minutes read back, okay?

801
00:53:11,567 --> 00:53:13,944
I was in the room. That was me...

802
00:53:13,986 --> 00:53:16,321
The guy with his thumb up his ass.
That was me.

803
00:53:20,617 --> 00:53:23,412
- Marty?
- Yeah?

804
00:53:23,453 --> 00:53:26,832
I need to leave early today.
Donald and I are going to Big Bear

805
00:53:26,874 --> 00:53:31,211
to check out this banquet hall.
There's a giant moose head

806
00:53:31,253 --> 00:53:33,964
he's convinced should be
the centerpiece for our reception,

807
00:53:34,006 --> 00:53:36,049
I have to be there to tell him
how wrong he is.

808
00:53:36,133 --> 00:53:40,679
- All right, take the day off.
Listen, Diva...

809
00:53:40,721 --> 00:53:44,224
- About yesterday...
- No, Marty, don't worry about it.

810
00:53:44,308 --> 00:53:46,268
It's cool.

811
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:10,918
Laura?

812
00:54:13,795 --> 00:54:15,380
Laura?

813
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:18,592
(squeaking and giggling)

814
00:54:18,634 --> 00:54:20,719
What...?

815
00:54:22,554 --> 00:54:26,767
Diva?
I can't believe this.

816
00:54:26,808 --> 00:54:30,229
- Marty, don't be upset.
- Don't be upset? What should I be?

817
00:54:30,270 --> 00:54:33,524
My wife and assistant
are in bed together, what should I be?

818
00:54:33,565 --> 00:54:35,651
It's not like that.

819
00:54:35,692 --> 00:54:36,276
- Oh, it's not like that?
- No...

820
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:40,989
What's it like? It is like that.
You're screwing around on me.

821
00:54:41,031 --> 00:54:43,450
She's not screwing around
on you, I promise.

822
00:54:43,492 --> 00:54:46,620
Diva, you lied, okay?
You lied.

823
00:54:46,662 --> 00:54:48,205
You said you were going
to look at a moose head,

824
00:54:48,247 --> 00:54:51,250
which I gotta say, is the exact
opposite of what you're looking at.

825
00:54:51,291 --> 00:54:54,670
Marty, the showing got cancelled.
I didn't lie to you.

826
00:54:54,711 --> 00:54:56,004
We decided not to go.

827
00:54:56,046 --> 00:54:58,507
Okay, good! Go back to work.

828
00:54:58,549 --> 00:55:02,261
Don't come here and burrow your head
between my wife's legs.

829
00:55:02,302 --> 00:55:05,138
Marty? Why are you doing this?

830
00:55:05,180 --> 00:55:11,061
This... was for you.
We are warming up for you.

831
00:55:11,103 --> 00:55:14,106
"Warming up"? Waiting for me?

832
00:55:14,148 --> 00:55:16,608
Yes, this was supposed
to be a surprise,

833
00:55:16,650 --> 00:55:20,904
'cause I was planning
a little three-way... for you.

834
00:55:20,946 --> 00:55:22,865
A surprise for me?

835
00:55:22,906 --> 00:55:25,659
Yes - so, come on in, babe.

836
00:55:25,701 --> 00:55:29,079
Laura, do you really think
I'm gonna fall for that?

837
00:55:29,121 --> 00:55:31,707
(groaning and thumping)

838
00:55:36,461 --> 00:55:41,091
Okay... that was a good
surprise three-way, we can stop.

839
00:55:46,388 --> 00:55:48,515
Okay, Laura, everyone's good
and warmed up.

840
00:55:52,644 --> 00:55:54,438
Okay, Laura...

841
00:55:56,690 --> 00:56:00,694
How stupid do I look?
"Warming up" for me...?

842
00:56:02,112 --> 00:56:05,741
Warming up for me?
How stupid do I look, huh?!

843
00:56:08,577 --> 00:56:11,371
(Billy:)
What's up? You seem a little low.

844
00:56:11,413 --> 00:56:14,374
(Marty:)
Low? Yeah, I guess.

845
00:56:14,458 --> 00:56:18,003
- What's up?
- Nothin'.

846
00:56:18,045 --> 00:56:19,421
Come on, what's goin' on?

847
00:56:19,463 --> 00:56:23,425
Laura and I...
are going through something.

848
00:56:23,467 --> 00:56:26,136
What, is she sleeping
with a woman?

849
00:56:27,763 --> 00:56:31,099
You guessed that?
Who told you that?

850
00:56:31,141 --> 00:56:34,937
- You guessed that?
- What, did I guess right?

851
00:56:34,978 --> 00:56:39,191
Wait a minute. Your wife,
is sleeping with another woman?

852
00:56:40,359 --> 00:56:43,654
If you wanna get technical,
she's sleeping with two women.

853
00:56:43,695 --> 00:56:46,698
Your wife is sleeping
with a couple of women?!

854
00:56:46,740 --> 00:56:48,367
Wow.

855
00:56:48,408 --> 00:56:51,286
I begged and I pushed...

856
00:56:51,328 --> 00:56:54,122
and it happened.

857
00:56:54,164 --> 00:56:56,041
Good for you.

858
00:56:56,083 --> 00:56:57,793
Actually, it gets worse.

859
00:56:57,835 --> 00:56:59,294
You mean, it gets better.

860
00:56:59,336 --> 00:57:03,173
No... it gets worse.

861
00:57:03,215 --> 00:57:05,467
She's doing Diva.

862
00:57:06,510 --> 00:57:08,178
Diva?

863
00:57:08,220 --> 00:57:10,639
Your wife is sleeping
with your assistant, Diva?

864
00:57:10,681 --> 00:57:12,266
Diva - Diva?

865
00:57:12,307 --> 00:57:14,935
Yes... yes.

866
00:57:14,977 --> 00:57:17,938
It's not funny, Murphy.
It's not funny.

867
00:57:18,021 --> 00:57:21,358
Did she happen to mention
if she was any good?

868
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:23,569
It's not funny, Murphy!

869
00:57:23,610 --> 00:57:25,696
All right, I'm sorry.
But, you know...

870
00:57:25,737 --> 00:57:28,282
it's a video I would
definitely go and rent.

871
00:57:29,783 --> 00:57:32,828
So, Jane, how was your week?

872
00:57:32,870 --> 00:57:34,830
Eventful, I hope?

873
00:57:34,872 --> 00:57:37,666
Not as eventful as Laura's.

874
00:57:39,209 --> 00:57:43,130
You told her? I can't believe it.
That's a breach.

875
00:57:43,213 --> 00:57:47,092
Honey, she's my best friend.
I tell her everything.

876
00:57:47,134 --> 00:57:49,011
Apparently, you do.

877
00:57:49,052 --> 00:57:51,513
Are you gonna tell me
you didn't tell Billy and Murphy?

878
00:57:51,555 --> 00:57:54,892
No, I didn't. Of course not.
I wouldn't do that.

879
00:57:55,893 --> 00:57:58,020
- Did she tell you everything?
- Oh, yeah.

880
00:57:58,061 --> 00:58:00,355
She tell you
she seduced my assistant?

881
00:58:00,355 --> 00:58:03,358
- I love it.
- You love it?

882
00:58:03,358 --> 00:58:06,195
Good, Jane,
egg her on, that's good.

883
00:58:06,236 --> 00:58:08,530
After dinner, we'll go to the Forum,

884
00:58:08,572 --> 00:58:10,699
they're playing
women's basketball tonight,

885
00:58:10,741 --> 00:58:14,203
she can just do the whole team.
How's that?

886
00:58:14,244 --> 00:58:16,163
Just throw her in the locker room.

887
00:58:30,344 --> 00:58:34,097
Hey! Open up.
Remember me?

888
00:58:34,139 --> 00:58:36,475
The guy barely paying the mortgage?
Come on.

889
00:58:36,517 --> 00:58:38,936
(Laura:)
Okay, I'm coming. Hold on.

890
00:58:41,146 --> 00:58:43,482
Why's the door locked?
What are you doing?

891
00:58:43,524 --> 00:58:45,734
- Nothing.
- You're alone...?

892
00:58:45,776 --> 00:58:48,529
You're in here alone?

893
00:58:48,570 --> 00:58:51,073
Yeah, I'm alone.

894
00:58:51,114 --> 00:58:53,534
Hi, Marty.

895
00:58:53,575 --> 00:58:55,828
Marty, don't be mad.

896
00:58:55,869 --> 00:58:57,913
Diva! Jane...!

897
00:58:57,955 --> 00:59:02,084
Hello, pen dick.
Guess who brought the play toys?

898
00:59:02,125 --> 00:59:05,087
Laura...!

899
00:59:05,128 --> 00:59:07,714
Hey, Marty...

900
00:59:07,756 --> 00:59:11,385
don't be mad.
It's just a little nightmare.

901
00:59:18,016 --> 00:59:20,561
You had a dream...
that they had an orgy,

902
00:59:20,602 --> 00:59:21,937
and locked you out.

903
00:59:21,979 --> 00:59:25,274
Not a dream, a nightmare.

904
00:59:25,315 --> 00:59:27,734
Three incredible women,
lying around,

905
00:59:27,776 --> 00:59:30,445
lapping up
the little man in the canoe,

906
00:59:30,487 --> 00:59:32,197
where is the nightmare in that?

907
00:59:32,239 --> 00:59:34,449
The nightmare is,
they want nothing to do with me.

908
00:59:34,491 --> 00:59:36,285
I was locked outside the door.

909
00:59:36,326 --> 00:59:39,079
That speaks of sexual
inadequacy to me.

910
00:59:39,121 --> 00:59:39,872
Exactly.

911
00:59:39,913 --> 00:59:41,415
What are you talking about?

912
00:59:41,456 --> 00:59:43,542
It was your dream,
all I'm sayin' is...

913
00:59:43,584 --> 00:59:45,460
if that were me,
in that situation,

914
00:59:45,502 --> 00:59:48,088
and I found myself
locked outside the bedroom door,

915
00:59:48,130 --> 00:59:50,090
with my schmekel in my mitt,

916
00:59:50,174 --> 00:59:52,342
I'd be thinking about sex therapy.
That's all I'm sayin'.

917
00:59:57,097 --> 00:59:59,266
Are you mad, Marty?

918
00:59:59,308 --> 01:00:01,268
Don't be mad.

919
01:00:01,310 --> 01:00:03,645
Mad? I'm not mad,
I'm worried.

920
01:00:03,645 --> 01:00:06,231
I'm justifiably worried.

921
01:00:06,273 --> 01:00:09,693
Honey, you shouldn't be.
I'm just experimenting as a woman.

922
01:00:09,735 --> 01:00:12,488
- Really, it's nice.
- Oh, that's nice...

923
01:00:12,488 --> 01:00:13,655
it's "nice".

924
01:00:13,697 --> 01:00:18,494
Obviously, I've been hiding
things from you... from myself...

925
01:00:18,494 --> 01:00:24,208
It's gonna be okay. Either way,
it's not a big deal, all right?

926
01:00:24,249 --> 01:00:26,502
Tomorrow I'm going to Vegas,
and the drive...

927
01:00:26,502 --> 01:00:29,838
and the time away,
will be good for me. Okay?

928
01:00:31,215 --> 01:00:32,799
You're going to Vegas
with my sister.

929
01:00:32,841 --> 01:00:36,512
Listen, I'm beggin' you.
This is my baby sister.

930
01:00:36,553 --> 01:00:39,014
- This is my baby sister.
- Marty, stop it.

931
01:00:39,056 --> 01:00:41,266
- We go to Vegas every year...
- This isn't every year!

932
01:00:41,308 --> 01:00:44,478
I am not going to disappoint her.
Nothing is going to happen.

933
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:46,396
Would you just relax?

934
01:00:46,438 --> 01:00:48,357
All set, Laura.

935
01:00:49,233 --> 01:00:51,276
I'm rarin' and ready to go.

936
01:00:51,318 --> 01:00:53,862
I am your prisoner
for the next 24 hours.

937
01:00:53,904 --> 01:00:55,405
Just... do with me what you will.

938
01:00:55,447 --> 01:00:57,032
Oh, God...

939
01:00:57,074 --> 01:00:59,785
Listen to me,
we need to postpone this,

940
01:00:59,827 --> 01:01:01,370
just till we get you professional help.

941
01:01:01,411 --> 01:01:03,247
I don't need professional help, Marty.

942
01:01:03,288 --> 01:01:06,250
Okay, I got a good compromise.
Separate rooms, okay?

943
01:01:06,291 --> 01:01:10,087
On the far side of the hotel.

944
01:01:10,128 --> 01:01:12,005
You can be in the east wing,
she can be in the west wing.

945
01:01:12,047 --> 01:01:14,174
You're on thin ice here, Laura,
thin ice...

946
01:01:15,259 --> 01:01:16,552
- Laura, sweetie...
- Bye.

947
01:01:16,552 --> 01:01:18,679
No, don't go! No, wait...

948
01:01:19,555 --> 01:01:21,181
Bye, Marty!

949
01:01:23,016 --> 01:01:26,145
Laura, don't you dare have sex
with my baby sister!

950
01:01:54,715 --> 01:01:56,258
(knocking)

951
01:01:57,843 --> 01:02:00,387
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey, Murphy.

952
01:02:00,470 --> 01:02:02,931
- Made myself a little sandwich.
- No problem.

953
01:02:02,931 --> 01:02:04,057
Where's Laura?

954
01:02:04,141 --> 01:02:06,226
She's in Vegas with my sister.

955
01:02:08,145 --> 01:02:09,938
Is she diddling your sister?

956
01:02:11,648 --> 01:02:12,774
She is?

957
01:02:12,816 --> 01:02:14,193
I didn't say that.

958
01:02:14,234 --> 01:02:19,156
Your wife is diddling your sister...!

959
01:02:19,198 --> 01:02:21,074
Your wife is diddling your sister?

960
01:02:21,116 --> 01:02:24,620
Your wife - is diddling your sister?!

961
01:02:25,287 --> 01:02:26,955
That's great!

962
01:02:26,955 --> 01:02:28,874
Your wife is diddling your sister?

963
01:02:28,916 --> 01:02:32,503
Hey, who can blame her?
Your sister's a hottie.

964
01:02:32,544 --> 01:02:35,088
Can I use your phone?
I wanna call my wife,

965
01:02:35,130 --> 01:02:37,341
I'd like to set the two of them up
for a little lunch.

966
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:41,470
(car approaching)

967
01:02:41,512 --> 01:02:45,182
Ellen, baby... hi.
Have fun?

968
01:02:45,224 --> 01:02:47,684
Look at this, you're dressed alike...?

969
01:02:48,769 --> 01:02:50,979
You're all happy, look at you,
you're happy.

970
01:02:50,979 --> 01:02:54,191
You won? Is that what happened,
you won?

971
01:02:54,233 --> 01:02:57,444
No? You lost, and you're all smiley
'cause you lost?

972
01:02:57,486 --> 01:02:59,780
Actually, we didn't gamble.

973
01:02:59,822 --> 01:03:01,615
No, no gambling.

974
01:03:01,657 --> 01:03:04,618
I'll see you soon.
I had a wonderful time.

975
01:03:04,660 --> 01:03:05,786
So did I. Bye.

976
01:03:05,828 --> 01:03:09,122
Wonderful? What do you mean,
"wonderful"?

977
01:03:09,164 --> 01:03:12,626
You saw shows? You
went shopping... right?

978
01:03:12,668 --> 01:03:14,962
- No shows.
- No shows...?

979
01:03:15,003 --> 01:03:18,465
Laura... tell me you didn't
have sex with my sister.

980
01:03:18,507 --> 01:03:20,843
I didn't have sex with your sister.

981
01:03:20,884 --> 01:03:24,179
I mean, not like you're thinking.
Not really.

982
01:03:24,221 --> 01:03:27,391
Not really? What does that mean,
"not really"?

983
01:03:27,432 --> 01:03:29,893
How do you "not really"
have sex with someone's sister?

984
01:03:29,935 --> 01:03:33,438
We talked, we held each other,
and it was really nice.

985
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:36,275
You know what? It's been so long
since anybody's touched her.

986
01:03:36,316 --> 01:03:38,360
Don't tell me that.
I don't wanna know that.

987
01:03:38,402 --> 01:03:42,322
Do you want breakfast?
I'm gonna have a giant breakfast.

988
01:03:42,364 --> 01:03:44,741
This is becoming
a nightmare with you.

989
01:03:44,783 --> 01:03:47,244
- No, it isn't.
- Yes, it is.

990
01:03:47,286 --> 01:03:50,164
You're taking this the wrong way.
I am feeling so great.

991
01:03:50,205 --> 01:03:51,540
Oh, good.

992
01:03:51,582 --> 01:03:52,749
This is going
to be good for us.

993
01:03:52,791 --> 01:03:56,253
"Good for us"...? How is this
going to be good for us?!

994
01:03:56,295 --> 01:03:59,089
You had sex with my sister!
Hey...

995
01:03:59,131 --> 01:04:02,050
big family reunion coming,
why don't you make a wish list?

996
01:04:02,092 --> 01:04:05,512
Well, that's it.
I've blown it.

997
01:04:05,554 --> 01:04:08,557
Turned her into a sex monster.

998
01:04:08,599 --> 01:04:10,934
She's gonna leave me, too, Billy.
I can feel it.

999
01:04:10,976 --> 01:04:13,604
You haven't blown it.
She's not going anywhere.

1000
01:04:13,645 --> 01:04:16,190
So she likes girls, big deal.
So do you.

1001
01:04:16,231 --> 01:04:18,317
Now you got something in common.

1002
01:04:18,358 --> 01:04:21,862
This is what you wanted.
Relax. Enjoy it.

1003
01:04:21,904 --> 01:04:24,781
Easy for you to say, BIIly.
It's not your wife.

1004
01:04:24,823 --> 01:04:28,118
If it was my wife,
I'd be diggin' it.

1005
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:30,412
But that ain't never gonna happen.

1006
01:04:30,454 --> 01:04:32,915
Carol's too damned hungry
to bother having sex.

1007
01:04:56,647 --> 01:04:59,107
Hey, just spoke with Pembroke.

1008
01:04:59,149 --> 01:05:01,109
Got some pretty good news for ya...

1009
01:05:01,151 --> 01:05:04,279
- Guy sounds very interested...
- Yeah?

1010
01:05:06,657 --> 01:05:08,534
What was that for?

1011
01:05:09,117 --> 01:05:11,537
That's for you
and your wife's big mouth.

1012
01:05:13,872 --> 01:05:16,625
I'm sorry, honey.
I did tell Carol

1013
01:05:16,667 --> 01:05:20,587
about what you told me
about Billy's girlfriend.

1014
01:05:20,629 --> 01:05:22,339
I'm sorry.

1015
01:05:23,674 --> 01:05:27,135
I was in a weakened state,
and we were talking,

1016
01:05:28,512 --> 01:05:30,597
she was vulnerable...

1017
01:05:30,681 --> 01:05:34,309
she was hungry and she needed
someone to share a pizza with.

1018
01:05:34,351 --> 01:05:36,979
And not be judged for it.

1019
01:05:37,020 --> 01:05:40,482
She really needed me.
Carol really needed me.

1020
01:05:40,482 --> 01:05:42,693
She did.

1021
01:05:44,403 --> 01:05:47,489
Hey, Marty, how's that hot
little wife of yours?

1022
01:05:47,531 --> 01:05:49,575
Wouldn't mind gettin' me
some of that action.

1023
01:05:51,743 --> 01:05:53,287
I'd bang your wife so hard, Marty,

1024
01:05:53,328 --> 01:05:55,789
you'd think a brass band
was coming down the street.

1025
01:05:55,831 --> 01:05:59,209
Who's my bitch? I'd have her
screaming,"Who's my bitch?"

1026
01:05:59,251 --> 01:06:01,795
I would go so far down
on your wife,

1027
01:06:01,837 --> 01:06:04,506
you'd need a passport
to get her out of Central America.

1028
01:06:04,548 --> 01:06:08,969
I was with your wife so long,
I gotta put my tongue in a sling.

1029
01:06:09,011 --> 01:06:11,972
I'd chew her box
like a fuckin' hamster.

1030
01:06:12,014 --> 01:06:13,807
Nng-nng-nyagh!

1031
01:06:27,362 --> 01:06:28,447
Hey, babe.

1032
01:06:28,489 --> 01:06:31,492
Dr. Berman called.
He wants you to come right away.

1033
01:06:38,332 --> 01:06:41,835
Well, Marty, we found a polyp.

1034
01:06:43,462 --> 01:06:45,005
We need to take it out.

1035
01:06:45,547 --> 01:06:49,176
- Take it out?
- Does that mean surgery?

1036
01:06:49,218 --> 01:06:52,888
We do it here, now, run a test
and make sure it's benign.

1037
01:06:54,389 --> 01:06:55,974
Do it right here?

1038
01:06:56,391 --> 01:06:58,977
It's a very simple procedure, really.

1039
01:06:59,019 --> 01:07:02,898
Little prep work, one machine,
works with lasers.

1040
01:07:02,940 --> 01:07:05,150
Nice machines. Made by Sony.

1041
01:07:05,192 --> 01:07:07,528
Sony?

1042
01:07:10,906 --> 01:07:13,534
So... did I tell ya
I bought that Porsche Boxter?

1043
01:07:18,622 --> 01:07:22,751
Sweetie, wake up.
Wake up, honey.

1044
01:07:22,793 --> 01:07:25,420
- You need to eat.
- I'm not hungry, Laura.

1045
01:07:25,462 --> 01:07:28,048
You haven't eaten all day.
Have a little soup.

1046
01:07:28,090 --> 01:07:29,758
I don't want any soup.

1047
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:32,511
Honey... here, let me help you up.

1048
01:07:33,595 --> 01:07:36,890
What? Why is it so important
that I eat soup?

1049
01:07:36,932 --> 01:07:38,976
- What do you mean?
- What'd you put in my soup?

1050
01:07:39,017 --> 01:07:40,936
- You put something in my soup?
- Marty...

1051
01:07:40,936 --> 01:07:43,480
Is that it? Slip a little doozy
in Marty's soup...

1052
01:07:43,522 --> 01:07:45,566
Send him off to all-boy heaven?

1053
01:07:45,607 --> 01:07:48,443
Move one of your little Bettys in,
is that what's going on?

1054
01:07:48,443 --> 01:07:51,280
- You're delirious.
- I'm not delirious,

1055
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:55,242
not with everything that's going on.
It's not far-fetched.

1056
01:07:55,284 --> 01:07:57,828
Perfect time. Blame it on the polyp.

1057
01:07:57,870 --> 01:07:59,621
How do I know you didn't
put something in this soup?

1058
01:07:59,663 --> 01:08:01,790
You're being ridiculous, honey.

1059
01:08:01,832 --> 01:08:05,210
Would you like me
to try the soup?

1060
01:08:05,252 --> 01:08:07,963
Yeah... you have the soup.

1061
01:08:15,971 --> 01:08:20,309
I'm sorry... I'm just wacked.
I'm sorry.

1062
01:08:25,105 --> 01:08:27,566
Hey, I'm sorry.

1063
01:08:35,657 --> 01:08:37,743
It's good soup.

1064
01:09:10,859 --> 01:09:12,236
(ringing)

1065
01:09:13,987 --> 01:09:16,156
Hello?

1066
01:09:16,198 --> 01:09:18,033
Yeah, just a moment.

1067
01:09:25,332 --> 01:09:28,669
Honey...
it's Dr. Berman.

1068
01:09:30,838 --> 01:09:34,049
- Hello?
- Marty? Jerry Berman.

1069
01:09:34,091 --> 01:09:37,594
These calls go one of two ways.

1070
01:09:37,636 --> 01:09:41,056
This one's going your way,
Marty. You're fine.

1071
01:09:41,098 --> 01:09:43,100
You should have a good life.

1072
01:09:43,142 --> 01:09:45,102
Give Laura my love...

1073
01:09:45,144 --> 01:09:47,062
and Marty, I gotta tell ya,
I've known you a long time,

1074
01:09:47,104 --> 01:09:50,274
you're the biggest baby
I've ever operated on. Ever.

1075
01:09:50,315 --> 01:09:52,818
I mean it. You're a wuss, Marty.

1076
01:09:52,860 --> 01:09:54,695
Okay, bye-bye.

1077
01:09:54,736 --> 01:09:56,113
Bye.

1078
01:09:57,197 --> 01:09:59,158
It's okay.

1079
01:10:09,877 --> 01:10:12,212
Marty?

1080
01:10:12,254 --> 01:10:14,423
I love you.

1081
01:10:15,340 --> 01:10:17,634
The scare was really good for me.

1082
01:10:17,676 --> 01:10:20,220
It made me realize
how much I love you.

1083
01:10:20,262 --> 01:10:24,975
Lately, I've been thinking I was hiding
this dark desire from you...

1084
01:10:25,017 --> 01:10:28,562
but, I haven't been.
Not at all.

1085
01:10:28,604 --> 01:10:32,274
It's not what I want.
I want what we have.

1086
01:10:32,274 --> 01:10:37,279
It's more important to me
than having sex with women.

1087
01:10:37,321 --> 01:10:39,615
I only wanna be with you.

1088
01:10:39,656 --> 01:10:42,951
Really, that's what I figured out...

1089
01:10:42,951 --> 01:10:45,662
I just wanna have sex with you.

1090
01:10:45,704 --> 01:10:52,669
Thanks, Laura. I gotta tell you,
I feel the same way.

1091
01:10:52,711 --> 01:10:54,755
A lot of sex, Marty.

1092
01:10:56,131 --> 01:11:00,594
A lot of sex...?
Okay... good.

1093
01:11:00,636 --> 01:11:04,097
I wanna triple the amount
of sex that we have.

1094
01:11:07,810 --> 01:11:10,103
You wanna triple the amount
of sex we have?

1095
01:11:11,939 --> 01:11:14,274
It's a lot of sex.

1096
01:11:14,316 --> 01:11:16,068
Ow - ow, ow...!

1097
01:11:23,742 --> 01:11:25,285
Don't stop, don't stop.

1098
01:11:28,455 --> 01:11:30,415
Was that okay?

1099
01:11:30,457 --> 01:11:33,335
You could do better.

1100
01:11:35,045 --> 01:11:37,506
I'm ready again, Marty.
Wake up.

1101
01:11:37,506 --> 01:11:39,925
Aggh - gentle, babe...!
Gentle...!

1102
01:11:39,967 --> 01:11:42,261
Come on... up-up-up!

1103
01:11:49,393 --> 01:11:51,353
It's playtime!

1104
01:11:56,817 --> 01:11:58,569
(car horn tootling)

1105
01:12:06,076 --> 01:12:07,744
Oh, shit, it's the Pembrokes.

1106
01:12:08,787 --> 01:12:11,498
- Hey, Dave.
- Hey, Marty, how ya doin'?

1107
01:12:11,540 --> 01:12:13,083
- Doin' good.
- Sorry to just drop by...

1108
01:12:13,125 --> 01:12:15,043
but we were in the neighborhood.

1109
01:12:15,043 --> 01:12:17,004
I thought you might
show us that house.

1110
01:12:17,045 --> 01:12:20,215
Definitely. Let me tell Laura
that I'm gonna go.

1111
01:12:20,257 --> 01:12:23,635
Bring her. I have a feeling
I'll need some company.

1112
01:12:48,076 --> 01:12:51,747
- Marty, you okay?
- I'm fine.

1113
01:12:51,747 --> 01:12:54,541
Every bedroom has it's own balcony.

1114
01:12:54,583 --> 01:12:57,544
First class windows,
everything high end...

1115
01:12:57,586 --> 01:13:01,173
Everything.
We get the best of everything.

1116
01:13:01,215 --> 01:13:03,258
Marty, this is a hell of a house.

1117
01:13:03,300 --> 01:13:05,385
This kid is a real talent.

1118
01:13:05,427 --> 01:13:07,221
Yes, he is, he's very talented.

1119
01:13:07,262 --> 01:13:12,476
He's lucky he's got
a strong partner, this was not easy...

1120
01:13:12,518 --> 01:13:14,978
I am very impressed
with this kid's work.

1121
01:13:15,020 --> 01:13:18,482
I'm glad.
We put a lot of work into it.

1122
01:13:20,567 --> 01:13:22,611
So, do you really dislike L.A.?

1123
01:13:22,653 --> 01:13:26,990
No. Dave does.
When you stay married long enough...

1124
01:13:27,032 --> 01:13:31,495
you have to think hard
which opinions are your own.

1125
01:13:31,537 --> 01:13:34,081
Yeah, I find myself doing that.

1126
01:13:34,122 --> 01:13:37,960
Grafting onto Marty's
likes and dislikes.

1127
01:13:38,001 --> 01:13:42,422
I hate to admit, being with Dave
has really changed me.

1128
01:13:42,464 --> 01:13:45,050
I used to be a Democrat.

1129
01:13:45,092 --> 01:13:49,805
He turned me into a Republican.
They can do that.

1130
01:13:49,805 --> 01:13:53,976
Before Dave, I was actually
a bit of a liberal.

1131
01:13:54,017 --> 01:13:55,978
What's this room in here?

1132
01:13:56,019 --> 01:14:02,234
This room is gonna be...
this is the...

1133
01:14:02,276 --> 01:14:06,155
I don't know. He's gonna be here,
we'll ask him.

1134
01:14:07,865 --> 01:14:10,701
Evie wants to have lunch.

1135
01:14:10,742 --> 01:14:13,245
Lunch with you and Evie?
You think that's a good idea?

1136
01:14:13,287 --> 01:14:15,622
What are you talking about?

1137
01:14:15,664 --> 01:14:17,749
Her husband is my only
serious silent investor...

1138
01:14:17,791 --> 01:14:20,794
and you have the sexual self-control
of a 52-year-old senator.

1139
01:14:20,836 --> 01:14:23,505
- You tell me.
- Thank you very much, honey.

1140
01:14:24,381 --> 01:14:28,385
Oh, damn, I got a parking ticket.
Goddamn parking ticket.

1141
01:14:28,427 --> 01:14:30,846
Honey, calm down.
It's just a parking ticket.

1142
01:14:30,846 --> 01:14:34,266
It's not a parking ticket.
It's God fucking with me.

1143
01:14:34,308 --> 01:14:37,853
First, he sends parking tickets,
then drought and famine.

1144
01:14:40,022 --> 01:14:42,900
No, he's not in either.

1145
01:14:42,941 --> 01:14:47,196
I asked Romberg, he gave me
the "money is tight" speech.

1146
01:14:47,196 --> 01:14:50,157
I'll figure it out.
All right...

1147
01:14:50,199 --> 01:14:51,909
Bye.

1148
01:14:58,582 --> 01:15:01,418
I've been thinking about it.
You think she really likes you?

1149
01:15:01,460 --> 01:15:03,504
Evie Pembroke?

1150
01:15:03,545 --> 01:15:05,130
Yeah, I think she likes me.

1151
01:15:05,172 --> 01:15:07,966
I know this is gonna piss you off...

1152
01:15:08,008 --> 01:15:11,386
this is gonna sound bad,
but I think you should pursue it.

1153
01:15:11,428 --> 01:15:14,056
Marty...?

1154
01:15:14,097 --> 01:15:15,933
Are you asking me
to have sex with Evie?

1155
01:15:15,974 --> 01:15:19,478
No, I'm not ask... no.

1156
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:21,897
I'm asking you to do
your little pizza gag,

1157
01:15:21,897 --> 01:15:25,192
do your little rap on her,
you know, get cozy...

1158
01:15:25,234 --> 01:15:29,071
Excuse me, I don't have a "rap",
and I resent this.

1159
01:15:29,071 --> 01:15:32,658
I'm just asking you to get
a litle friendly with the woman,

1160
01:15:32,699 --> 01:15:35,702
get to know her, talk her into
talking her husband...

1161
01:15:35,744 --> 01:15:38,080
into investing in my project, okay?

1162
01:15:38,080 --> 01:15:41,875
It's a favor I'm asking,
to keep this house, our lifestyle,

1163
01:15:41,917 --> 01:15:45,254
I need you to go in
for one last strategic hit.

1164
01:15:49,216 --> 01:15:50,759
What?

1165
01:15:51,927 --> 01:15:54,096
Wasn't such a big goddamn deal
when you were chasing my sister

1166
01:15:54,096 --> 01:15:56,515
around the Wayne Newton Suite.

1167
01:15:59,059 --> 01:16:00,811
Laura...!

1168
01:16:00,853 --> 01:16:04,982
These are so great,
you really are talented.

1169
01:16:05,023 --> 01:16:08,902
Thank you.
Marty made all my shelves.

1170
01:16:08,944 --> 01:16:11,280
I love this little guy.

1171
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:14,700
That's my dad.
That's my father.

1172
01:16:14,741 --> 01:16:15,450
Really?

1173
01:16:15,492 --> 01:16:17,703
I didn't know you knew my father.

1174
01:16:17,744 --> 01:16:21,874
Laura, I really,
really love your work.

1175
01:16:21,915 --> 01:16:25,502
It's so... warm.

1176
01:16:25,544 --> 01:16:26,962
Thank you.

1177
01:16:26,962 --> 01:16:28,964
I didn't know you did women.

1178
01:16:29,006 --> 01:16:32,593
I... don't, really...

1179
01:16:32,634 --> 01:16:34,386
I tried a few.

1180
01:16:35,387 --> 01:16:38,056
Looks like you have
a feel for them.

1181
01:16:38,098 --> 01:16:40,476
Do you like it?

1182
01:16:40,517 --> 01:16:44,354
I think I figured out...
that I preferred doing men.

1183
01:16:46,899 --> 01:16:48,817
That's a shame.

1184
01:16:49,818 --> 01:16:53,655
Look at you...
You're blushing.

1185
01:16:53,655 --> 01:16:56,200
- Am I?
- You're bright red...

1186
01:16:56,241 --> 01:16:57,993
I really don't think
we should be doing this.

1187
01:16:58,035 --> 01:16:59,286
Yes, we should...

1188
01:16:59,328 --> 01:17:01,079
I really don't...

1189
01:17:01,121 --> 01:17:02,956
Yes. We should.

1190
01:17:02,998 --> 01:17:04,833
I thought you were against this?

1191
01:17:04,833 --> 01:17:07,169
Me? No... Dave is.

1192
01:17:07,211 --> 01:17:09,838
- Dave is?
- Let go.

1193
01:17:11,298 --> 01:17:14,510
I'm the opposite of Dave.
Dave is square.

1194
01:17:14,510 --> 01:17:16,804
I am the opposite of square.

1195
01:17:16,845 --> 01:17:19,723
You're the opposite of square?

1196
01:17:19,765 --> 01:17:23,936
The first night I met you,
I picked up on your energy.

1197
01:17:23,977 --> 01:17:26,355
I've got an eye
and an ear for it.

1198
01:17:26,355 --> 01:17:28,941
I can pick 'em out in a crowd.

1199
01:17:28,982 --> 01:17:33,904
Straight little wife
with a straight little life.

1200
01:17:33,946 --> 01:17:36,740
You're so pent up, aren't you?

1201
01:17:37,199 --> 01:17:40,369
It's okay. You're about ready
to let the dam burst.

1202
01:17:40,410 --> 01:17:43,455
I think I kinda like the dam.

1203
01:17:43,497 --> 01:17:45,874
I'm not sure
I wanna see it burst.

1204
01:17:45,874 --> 01:17:48,001
I've gotta go.

1205
01:17:48,043 --> 01:17:52,089
We'll continue this conversation
another time.

1206
01:17:56,885 --> 01:17:59,638
Hey, how you doin', man?
Listen...

1207
01:18:00,931 --> 01:18:03,058
I'm kidding. I was joking.

1208
01:18:03,100 --> 01:18:06,854
Hey... she looks great.
Hi, Carol.

1209
01:18:06,895 --> 01:18:08,647
(Billy:)
I don't know what your wife did to her,

1210
01:18:08,689 --> 01:18:14,361
but she's a whole different animal.
She's on a diet, she's into sex,

1211
01:18:14,403 --> 01:18:15,737
So things worked out, right?
Friends again?

1212
01:18:17,072 --> 01:18:18,073
No.

1213
01:18:18,115 --> 01:18:22,619
I know why you told her.
You think you're better than me.

1214
01:18:22,661 --> 01:18:26,206
Because you think you don't cheat
behind your wife's back...

1215
01:18:26,248 --> 01:18:27,916
because you cheat
in front of her face,

1216
01:18:27,958 --> 01:18:31,420
you've found this high moral ground
where you can judge me from.

1217
01:18:31,461 --> 01:18:33,755
- That's not true, Billy.
- It is true.

1218
01:18:33,755 --> 01:18:34,256
It isn't...

1219
01:18:34,298 --> 01:18:36,717
It is, and you know it.
And you're wrong.

1220
01:18:36,758 --> 01:18:40,554
You can be in the same bed
with your wife and be cheating on her.

1221
01:18:40,596 --> 01:18:43,515
- You're in big trouble with God.
- Don't say that.

1222
01:18:43,557 --> 01:18:47,436
I'm gonna finish the house,
we'll sell it...

1223
01:18:47,436 --> 01:18:49,521
You'll get your money back,
then, you know what?

1224
01:18:49,563 --> 01:18:52,691
We're done. I mean it.
We're done.

1225
01:18:52,733 --> 01:18:54,568
Fine. I got it.

1226
01:18:54,610 --> 01:18:59,615
I don't like you.
I don't trust you.

1227
01:18:59,656 --> 01:19:01,241
I got it.

1228
01:19:01,283 --> 01:19:06,163
I just realized that you're not
my kinda guy.

1229
01:19:06,205 --> 01:19:09,249
Hey - I got it.
I got it.

1230
01:19:09,291 --> 01:19:11,710
I got it.

1231
01:19:14,713 --> 01:19:16,256
I got it.

1232
01:19:24,598 --> 01:19:26,517
Evie...! Hi.

1233
01:19:28,519 --> 01:19:30,437
I was just going shopping.
You wanna join me?

1234
01:19:30,479 --> 01:19:33,816
Shopping? No, no...

1235
01:19:33,857 --> 01:19:37,236
I've already done my shopping.
I'm here to close a sale.

1236
01:19:37,277 --> 01:19:39,947
Close a sale?

1237
01:19:39,988 --> 01:19:43,242
- I'm going inside.
- You're going inside?

1238
01:19:43,283 --> 01:19:48,163
Inside, upstairs, I'm gonna wait
for you in the bedroom.

1239
01:19:48,163 --> 01:19:49,581
Wait for me?

1240
01:19:49,623 --> 01:19:53,001
I don't have a lotta time.
It's my Cub Scout pickup day.

1241
01:19:53,001 --> 01:19:55,254
Come on, come on...
quickly.

1242
01:19:56,338 --> 01:19:58,465
Wait for me upstairs...?

1243
01:20:04,054 --> 01:20:06,140
Door's locked.

1244
01:20:08,350 --> 01:20:10,978
Billy? It's for you.

1245
01:20:17,359 --> 01:20:19,027
- This is Billy.
- This is Pembroke...

1246
01:20:19,069 --> 01:20:21,029
Where's your partner?
I got a check for him.

1247
01:20:21,071 --> 01:20:24,074
I'm in with you guys,
I just wanna go over a few things.

1248
01:20:24,116 --> 01:20:26,410
I don't know.
I think he went home.

1249
01:20:26,451 --> 01:20:28,996
I'll head over there.
I'll talk to you soon.

1250
01:20:29,037 --> 01:20:30,539
All right.

1251
01:20:45,095 --> 01:20:46,388
Hey...

1252
01:20:51,143 --> 01:20:53,896
you wanna have
some real fun?

1253
01:20:53,896 --> 01:20:55,814
More fun than this?

1254
01:21:02,779 --> 01:21:05,073
Those are Marty's favorite ties...

1255
01:21:05,073 --> 01:21:08,118
Aw, poor Marty.

1256
01:21:08,160 --> 01:21:10,245
To hell with Marty!

1257
01:21:10,287 --> 01:21:12,748
I want you to tie me up.

1258
01:21:12,789 --> 01:21:15,876
Now, push me down!
Push me hard.

1259
01:21:25,552 --> 01:21:29,348
There you go...
tied up and gagged. What's next?

1260
01:21:29,389 --> 01:21:31,350
(garbled)

1261
01:21:34,770 --> 01:21:36,146
The pillow...?

1262
01:21:39,525 --> 01:21:42,444
Evie, you're starting
to scare me now.

1263
01:21:46,198 --> 01:21:47,950
Laura?

1264
01:21:49,952 --> 01:21:51,411
Laura?

1265
01:21:57,334 --> 01:21:59,378
- Oh, shit!
- Marty...!

1266
01:21:59,419 --> 01:22:00,963
Are you kiddin' me?!

1267
01:22:06,176 --> 01:22:08,929
Marty...
don't be mad.

1268
01:22:08,971 --> 01:22:12,182
Don't be mad.
You were the one, you told me...

1269
01:22:12,224 --> 01:22:15,727
I was, what? "The one", what?
I told you to tie her up?!

1270
01:22:15,769 --> 01:22:20,149
You've got Dave Pembroke's wife
tied up in our bedroom!

1271
01:22:20,190 --> 01:22:22,568
Have you lost touch with reality?!

1272
01:22:22,609 --> 01:22:26,572
Marty... you started all of this.
You.

1273
01:22:26,613 --> 01:22:27,698
- Me...?
- Yes.

1274
01:22:27,739 --> 01:22:31,910
I said, "get chummy with her."
I didn't ask to take her hostage.

1275
01:22:31,952 --> 01:22:33,662
Oh, my God!

1276
01:22:33,704 --> 01:22:36,790
You made me open certain doors
that I shouldn't have opened.

1277
01:22:36,832 --> 01:22:38,876
What are you talking about?

1278
01:22:38,917 --> 01:22:40,878
You know exactly
what I'm talking about.

1279
01:22:40,919 --> 01:22:43,839
- This is what you wanted.
- What I wanted?

1280
01:22:43,839 --> 01:22:47,926
I wanted you to tie up
Evie Pembroke in our bedroom?

1281
01:22:47,968 --> 01:22:51,930
You wanted me to be...
you know!

1282
01:22:51,972 --> 01:22:54,475
What?
I wanted you to try a few things.

1283
01:22:54,516 --> 01:22:57,478
I wanted you to fool around a little.
Is that so bad?

1284
01:22:57,519 --> 01:23:00,481
I didn't want you to become
a walking orgasm!

1285
01:23:00,522 --> 01:23:02,858
Jesus, you've taken
the whole thing way too far!

1286
01:23:02,900 --> 01:23:04,818
No, I haven't.
Don't you say that.

1287
01:23:04,860 --> 01:23:06,987
- Yes, you have.
- Don't you say that!

1288
01:23:09,031 --> 01:23:12,367
Listen to me. You've taken
the whole thing way too far.

1289
01:23:12,367 --> 01:23:14,703
You're tying women up,
and you're gagging them, now.

1290
01:23:14,703 --> 01:23:16,538
That's too far. What's next...

1291
01:23:16,538 --> 01:23:20,000
I'm gonna come home and you'll be
performing surgery on some girl!

1292
01:23:20,042 --> 01:23:22,669
It is not like that.

1293
01:23:22,711 --> 01:23:24,505
This is your fault.
I was happy...

1294
01:23:24,546 --> 01:23:26,924
I was happy
just being your wife!

1295
01:23:26,965 --> 01:23:31,470
Oh, Laura,
will you just calm dowm?

1296
01:23:33,388 --> 01:23:36,225
If you had all this in you,
it was gonna come out sooner or later.

1297
01:23:38,018 --> 01:23:40,395
Maybe, maybe not.

1298
01:23:40,437 --> 01:23:43,732
Maybe I didn't want the dam to burst.
Ever think about that?

1299
01:23:43,774 --> 01:23:45,359
What "dam"?
What are you talking about?

1300
01:23:45,400 --> 01:23:47,236
You burst the dam, Marty.

1301
01:23:47,277 --> 01:23:48,946
What fuckin' "dam"?

1302
01:23:48,987 --> 01:23:51,824
- This is all your doing.
- My doing?

1303
01:23:51,865 --> 01:23:55,244
You tied that woman up in there.
Not me... you.

1304
01:24:09,258 --> 01:24:12,803
- She's tied up with my Hugo Boss ties?
- She picked the ties.

1305
01:24:12,845 --> 01:24:14,596
Oh... she has taste.
That's good to know.

1306
01:24:14,596 --> 01:24:15,931
(doorbell rings)

1307
01:24:15,931 --> 01:24:17,891
- Who's this?
- I don't know.

1308
01:24:17,933 --> 01:24:19,143
Well, go find out.

1309
01:24:22,437 --> 01:24:23,814
(gasping)

1310
01:24:27,317 --> 01:24:28,527
- Marty!
- What?

1311
01:24:28,569 --> 01:24:30,445
It's Dave!

1312
01:24:30,445 --> 01:24:33,282
He's here? Dave?!

1313
01:24:35,325 --> 01:24:37,286
- Why's he here?
- I don't know.

1314
01:24:42,374 --> 01:24:43,625
He is here.

1315
01:24:43,625 --> 01:24:46,753
What do we do?

1316
01:24:46,795 --> 01:24:48,547
Act natural.

1317
01:24:49,298 --> 01:24:52,176
No... that's semi-natural.

1318
01:24:52,217 --> 01:24:54,636
Yes... whatever...
do it over there.

1319
01:25:03,770 --> 01:25:05,272
Hey, Dave,
how ya doin', Dave...?

1320
01:25:05,314 --> 01:25:08,317
Hey... hey, Dave...
Hey, Dave...!

1321
01:25:10,527 --> 01:25:13,322
Hey, Dave! How, ya doin'?
Come out to the yard...

1322
01:25:13,322 --> 01:25:15,574
- Where's my wife?
- Your wife? I don't know...

1323
01:25:15,616 --> 01:25:18,452
You wanna go down to the corner,
get a drink, talk about the project?

1324
01:25:18,494 --> 01:25:21,663
- No... her car's here.
- Her car's here...?

1325
01:25:21,663 --> 01:25:23,999
- Hi, Laura.
- Hey, Dave, how ya doin'?

1326
01:25:23,999 --> 01:25:26,376
Where's Evie?

1327
01:25:26,418 --> 01:25:27,669
She's not here...

1328
01:25:27,711 --> 01:25:29,755
No, she's not here... no.

1329
01:25:29,796 --> 01:25:32,591
Her car's here. Any idea why
her car would be here?

1330
01:25:32,633 --> 01:25:35,093
Her car is here?
Wow...

1331
01:25:35,135 --> 01:25:37,471
I'm not a car person,
so I wouldn't know.

1332
01:25:37,513 --> 01:25:39,181
She's never been a car person.

1333
01:25:39,181 --> 01:25:41,558
You're not a "car person"?

1334
01:25:41,600 --> 01:25:44,645
Dave, let's go in the yard,
and have a drink...

1335
01:25:44,686 --> 01:25:47,105
I don't wanna drink, Marty,
I need to find my wife.

1336
01:25:47,147 --> 01:25:48,690
(doorbell rings)

1337
01:25:48,732 --> 01:25:51,193
- Maybe that's her.
- No, it's not her.

1338
01:25:51,235 --> 01:25:52,986
Honey, you don't know
that it's not her.

1339
01:25:53,028 --> 01:25:55,030
- I don't?
- He doesn't?

1340
01:25:55,072 --> 01:25:58,867
I don't... I couldn't know.
There's no way I'd know it's not her.

1341
01:25:58,867 --> 01:26:02,663
But I'll check and I'll see.
I'll get the door.

1342
01:26:02,704 --> 01:26:04,540
Go in the yard, okay, buddy?

1343
01:26:04,540 --> 01:26:06,375
Yeah, come in... the yard.

1344
01:26:07,876 --> 01:26:11,588
Didi... bad time.
Laura's not here.

1345
01:26:11,630 --> 01:26:14,424
Marty wait,
I have to talk to Laura.

1346
01:26:14,466 --> 01:26:16,343
I want to take her
to the sculpture sympo-see-um.

1347
01:26:16,385 --> 01:26:17,886
I really think
it would be good for her.

1348
01:26:17,928 --> 01:26:20,472
Laura's not here,
and I'm in the middle of something.

1349
01:26:20,514 --> 01:26:21,890
You have to go.

1350
01:26:21,890 --> 01:26:24,601
Her car is here, I know she's here.
What is your problem?

1351
01:26:24,643 --> 01:26:27,688
Didi, don't take this wrong...

1352
01:26:27,729 --> 01:26:30,107
but Laura does not want
to be part of your little club.

1353
01:26:30,149 --> 01:26:31,984
My "little club"?

1354
01:26:32,025 --> 01:26:35,612
Yes. She had a trial membership,
and we're not gonna renew.

1355
01:26:35,654 --> 01:26:37,489
"A trial membership"?

1356
01:26:37,531 --> 01:26:39,950
...And I have to go.

1357
01:26:39,992 --> 01:26:41,952
It's not about you, no offense,

1358
01:26:41,994 --> 01:26:44,746
but we're not gonna
renew the membership.

1359
01:26:44,746 --> 01:26:47,207
What's the deal with Marty?

1360
01:26:47,249 --> 01:26:50,377
We just bought
a new espresso machine,

1361
01:26:50,419 --> 01:26:53,130
and he just had...
whoa... way too much.

1362
01:26:53,172 --> 01:26:55,215
I'm gonna say goodbye.

1363
01:26:55,257 --> 01:26:57,968
All you guys think you know
so much about lesbians...

1364
01:26:58,010 --> 01:27:00,596
you think you're so into lesbians,
but you're not.

1365
01:27:00,637 --> 01:27:03,182
You are into what you wish
lesbians were...

1366
01:27:03,223 --> 01:27:05,851
cock-hungry nyphos,
keeping themselves busy

1367
01:27:05,893 --> 01:27:11,023
until a real man hits town.
That's not the reality.

1368
01:27:11,064 --> 01:27:12,858
Quickly, what's the reality?
I gotta go.

1369
01:27:12,900 --> 01:27:15,944
The reality is, that you pushed,
and you pushed,

1370
01:27:15,986 --> 01:27:18,739
and now your wife eats pussy
better than you do.

1371
01:27:18,780 --> 01:27:20,449
Have a nice day.

1372
01:27:24,703 --> 01:27:27,831
Honey...?

1373
01:27:27,873 --> 01:27:30,167
That have anything
to do with Evie?

1374
01:27:30,209 --> 01:27:32,461
- Wasn't Evie?
- No...

1375
01:27:32,461 --> 01:27:34,296
Someone about a "sympo-see-um".

1376
01:27:34,338 --> 01:27:37,508
- A "sympo-see-um"?
- Yeah, a "sympo-see-um".

1377
01:27:37,549 --> 01:27:39,551
A "sympo-see-um"?

1378
01:27:39,593 --> 01:27:42,513
Yeah...!
Yeah, Dave...

1379
01:27:42,554 --> 01:27:44,097
What the hell
is going on here, Marty?

1380
01:27:44,139 --> 01:27:46,016
Let's go get a drink...

1381
01:27:46,058 --> 01:27:48,602
I'm going stir crazy.
I gotta get out of the house...

1382
01:27:48,644 --> 01:27:50,437
(mumbling)

1383
01:27:50,479 --> 01:27:51,814
What's that?

1384
01:27:52,648 --> 01:27:54,525
- Our dog...
- Sounds like Evie.

1385
01:27:54,566 --> 01:27:56,485
It's our new dog.
A barking terrier.

1386
01:27:56,485 --> 01:27:59,279
Is that Evie?
Evie...?

1387
01:27:59,321 --> 01:28:01,198
Evie...!

1388
01:28:02,950 --> 01:28:04,409
(distressed cry)

1389
01:28:05,577 --> 01:28:07,412
Evie!

1390
01:28:10,833 --> 01:28:14,670
Holy mother of God!
Evie...!

1391
01:28:14,711 --> 01:28:15,963
Dave, I had nothing
to do with this.

1392
01:28:16,004 --> 01:28:17,840
I came in, saw the same thing,
and went, "Aggh!"

1393
01:28:17,881 --> 01:28:20,634
Son of a bitch!
You pervert!

1394
01:28:20,676 --> 01:28:22,177
(Evie squealing)

1395
01:28:22,219 --> 01:28:24,888
You're fucking dead!

1396
01:28:24,930 --> 01:28:27,224
No, no, Dave...!

1397
01:28:27,266 --> 01:28:30,394
You are a dead man, Marty!

1398
01:28:47,035 --> 01:28:49,329
Was it worth it, Marty?
'Cause you are gonna die!

1399
01:28:52,416 --> 01:28:54,877
Just stop it!
Are you all okay, Marty?

1400
01:28:54,918 --> 01:28:57,045
No, I'm not okay!
Do I look okay to you?

1401
01:28:59,047 --> 01:29:01,633
You are a dead man, Marty.

1402
01:29:01,675 --> 01:29:03,886
Don't hurt him.
No, no, it was me...

1403
01:29:03,927 --> 01:29:06,221
I tied Evie up!

1404
01:29:06,221 --> 01:29:08,849
- You tied my wife up?
- Yes...!

1405
01:29:08,891 --> 01:29:11,226
She didn't wanna do it!

1406
01:29:11,268 --> 01:29:12,728
It was me!

1407
01:29:12,769 --> 01:29:14,646
I didn't want to,
she seduced me.

1408
01:29:14,688 --> 01:29:16,648
I swear, I swear.

1409
01:29:16,690 --> 01:29:19,026
Laura didn't wanna tie her up.
Evie seduced her.

1410
01:29:19,067 --> 01:29:21,445
It's true, Dave.
It's true.

1411
01:29:21,487 --> 01:29:23,489
I wasn't gonna sleep
with any more women.

1412
01:29:23,530 --> 01:29:25,157
At least, not for a while, anyway.

1413
01:29:25,199 --> 01:29:26,867
Okay, good. Conversation
for another time...?

1414
01:29:26,909 --> 01:29:29,036
Dave... listen...

1415
01:29:30,621 --> 01:29:33,415
I'm a stand-up guy.
I would not tie your wife up.

1416
01:29:33,415 --> 01:29:34,875
I wouldn't.
I've known you a long time...

1417
01:29:34,917 --> 01:29:38,212
I wouldn't do anything
to jeopardize our relationship.

1418
01:29:38,253 --> 01:29:40,088
What the hell is your deal, man?

1419
01:29:40,130 --> 01:29:42,382
Married to some weird L.A. Sex freak?
Is that your thing?

1420
01:29:42,424 --> 01:29:45,052
Dave... don't call Laura names.

1421
01:29:45,093 --> 01:29:47,012
What should I call her?
That's what she is...

1422
01:29:47,054 --> 01:29:49,056
she's got my wife tied
and gagged up there.

1423
01:29:49,097 --> 01:29:50,891
What should I call her?

1424
01:29:50,933 --> 01:29:52,935
You're married to a deviate
L.A. Sex twat.

1425
01:29:52,976 --> 01:29:58,148
Dave, screw you.
Don't call Laura names. I mean it.

1426
01:29:58,190 --> 01:29:59,608
Screw you, Marty!

1427
01:29:59,650 --> 01:30:02,486
You're way overreacting,
I'm the one that should be pissed off.

1428
01:30:02,528 --> 01:30:04,112
You're overreacting, "Sunscreen".

1429
01:30:04,154 --> 01:30:07,783
I mean it. Take your Orange County
weatherbeaten ass...

1430
01:30:07,825 --> 01:30:11,203
go get your drip-dry, grisly,
whacked-out excuse for a wife,

1431
01:30:11,245 --> 01:30:13,372
and get the hell out of here.
I'm serious.

1432
01:30:13,413 --> 01:30:16,834
I mean it. You're a Republican.
This is a No Republican Zone.

1433
01:30:16,875 --> 01:30:19,920
You're messin' up
my property values.

1434
01:30:19,962 --> 01:30:21,088
Yeah.

1435
01:30:22,673 --> 01:30:24,591
Take off, Dave.

1436
01:30:26,635 --> 01:30:29,847
Aw, the hell with it.
To hell with you...

1437
01:30:29,888 --> 01:30:31,306
and to hell with her.

1438
01:30:31,348 --> 01:30:32,975
The hell with you!

1439
01:30:33,016 --> 01:30:35,269
Okay, Laura, he gets the message.

1440
01:30:37,020 --> 01:30:39,314
Don't be surprised when you get
a bill for cleaning and pressing

1441
01:30:39,356 --> 01:30:41,859
four Hugo Boss ties,
okay, Pembroke?

1442
01:30:45,487 --> 01:30:48,615
Oh, good, kick my gate, Millionaire.
That'll help.

1443
01:30:51,702 --> 01:30:53,620
Shit... that didn't go well.

1444
01:30:55,205 --> 01:30:57,040
It was nice
what you did, though. Thanks.

1445
01:30:57,082 --> 01:31:00,377
You're welcome.
I gotta pay the mortgage, though.

1446
01:31:03,881 --> 01:31:06,216
I think we're this close to violating
a federal law of some kind.

1447
01:31:06,258 --> 01:31:08,010
Go upstairs, and untie Evie.

1448
01:31:08,010 --> 01:31:09,720
No way...
I'm not gonna untie her.

1449
01:31:09,761 --> 01:31:13,974
You got a woman tied
and gagged upstairs. Go and untie her.

1450
01:31:14,016 --> 01:31:16,351
No, I'm not gonna untie her.

1451
01:31:16,393 --> 01:31:17,769
Hey... you tied her up...

1452
01:31:17,811 --> 01:31:19,938
Marty Barnes...
you go untie her yourself.

1453
01:31:19,980 --> 01:31:21,899
No, you tied her up,
you go untie her.

1454
01:31:21,940 --> 01:31:24,151
Go untie her, Marty.

1455
01:31:24,193 --> 01:31:26,320
Now!

1456
01:31:27,863 --> 01:31:29,948
Fine. I'll untie her.

1457
01:31:36,955 --> 01:31:39,458
It's not that big a deal to me.
I'm going.

1458
01:31:45,047 --> 01:31:47,216
Hi... Evie, hi.

1459
01:31:52,179 --> 01:31:54,807
Before I untie you,
while I have your attention...

1460
01:31:54,848 --> 01:31:57,476
I just wanted
to take a minute and say...

1461
01:31:58,894 --> 01:32:00,854
I know this is gonna be
really rough on you and Dave.

1462
01:32:02,689 --> 01:32:06,151
It's probably gonna end up
in divorce for the two of you.

1463
01:32:07,069 --> 01:32:09,446
That's really sad...

1464
01:32:09,988 --> 01:32:12,908
Okay, what I'm thinking is...

1465
01:32:12,908 --> 01:32:15,786
you're gonna have
half of Dave's money, right?

1466
01:32:15,828 --> 01:32:20,082
I gotta really good investment for you.
A project I'm working on...

1467
01:32:27,089 --> 01:32:29,716
- Hey, beautiful.
- Hey, honey.

1468
01:32:29,758 --> 01:32:31,260
Like my hair?

1469
01:32:31,301 --> 01:32:33,387
You kiddin'?
I'm crazy about it.

1470
01:32:34,555 --> 01:32:36,306
- Hungry?
- Yeah, I'm starved.

1471
01:32:36,348 --> 01:32:38,267
Can we go someplace nice?

1472
01:32:38,267 --> 01:32:39,476
Whatever you want.

1473
01:32:42,521 --> 01:32:44,398
Hi, I'm Henry.

1474
01:32:44,439 --> 01:32:46,275
I'm Marty.
Nice to meet you.

1475
01:32:46,275 --> 01:32:48,694
Nice to meet you.
You like her new hair?

1476
01:32:48,735 --> 01:32:50,237
Her hair?

1477
01:32:50,445 --> 01:32:51,989
Yeah, I like her hair.

1478
01:32:52,030 --> 01:32:53,198
Thanks.

1479
01:32:54,992 --> 01:32:56,827
- Nice meeting you, Henry.
- Bye.

1480
01:32:58,245 --> 01:33:00,122
You like this restaurant,
don't you?

1481
01:33:00,164 --> 01:33:02,541
- Always did.
- I know you did.

1482
01:33:02,583 --> 01:33:05,669
Know what? We're gonna start
coming here again.

1483
01:33:05,711 --> 01:33:08,630
That'd be nice. Thanks.

1484
01:33:10,632 --> 01:33:12,551
What did you think of Henry?

1485
01:33:13,635 --> 01:33:16,597
The guy at your salon?
Seemed like a nice guy.

1486
01:33:16,638 --> 01:33:18,390
You think he's openly bisexual?

1487
01:33:19,808 --> 01:33:21,852
What do you mean,
"openly bisexual"?

1488
01:33:21,894 --> 01:33:23,645
Well, If I went
in there this afternoon...

1489
01:33:23,645 --> 01:33:24,980
and went, "Hey...

1490
01:33:25,022 --> 01:33:28,317
is anybody in here bisexual?"
What do you think ol' Henry would do?

1491
01:33:28,317 --> 01:33:30,360
What's your point, Laura?

1492
01:33:30,402 --> 01:33:32,654
I think it would be
good for you.

1493
01:33:32,696 --> 01:33:34,364
Good for me?

1494
01:33:36,658 --> 01:33:38,535
You're messin' with me, right?

1495
01:33:38,577 --> 01:33:40,787
Yeah.

1496
01:33:41,747 --> 01:33:43,499
I might be.
