1
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:18,400
I remember the first time in my life
I felt that everything would come to an end.

2
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:24,200
Contemplating Death
looking straight into his eyes.

3
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,000
Dragons!

4
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,500
They say that when we are
die, everything looks in slow motion ...

5
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:07,200
Ah, that's me. At that time
my life, I knew I was two seconds
entering into eternity ...

6
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:11,000
"Be prepared"? I do not! For
at least, not ready to die!

7
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,000
Now that I think, looking in
perspective, not really going to die.

8
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,700
But then, when I was so
young, it seemed certainly death.

9
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,200
Which is weird because
it all started very well.

10
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,200
SCOUT CAMP

11
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,500
1. The Scout is worthy of confidence.
2. A Scout is loyal.

12
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,300
3. The Scout serving and helping others
without expectation of reward or praise.

13
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:48,000
4. The Scout is friend to all and
brother to other Scouts.
5. The Scout is courteous.

14
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
6. The Scout sees in nature
God's work and that's good
to animals and plants.

15
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,000
7. A Scout obeys without
replication and does nothing by halves.

16
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:03,500
8. A Scout smiles and sings even in difficulties.
9. The Scout is cheap and respects the property of others.

17
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
10. A Scout is clean in 
thoughts, words, deeds
and the use of all their senses.

18
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:12,700
We were all in the Scout mobile
and the way to adventure.

19
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:21,200
I remember like it was yesterday: friendship,
camaraderie, the rivalries, the outputs
the power to eat what you want ...

20
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,200
I went in the car.
Camp Road.

21
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Guys, I was thinking about making a
Court of Honor to analyze camp
once you get back. What do you think?

22
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,700
It would be great!

23
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,000
It would be nice to report that
win some specialties.

24
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,500
Specialties?

25
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,200
Yes, Logos Specialties. My brother
won one in less than two minutes.

26
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,200
In less than two
minutes? What did?

27
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:46,200
It was the special observer.
Reported to Synod all the evidence
I had to find and voila!

28
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,000
In one out? Your brother
is a lucky guy!

29
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,500
- Yes, and so won the special observer.
- Your brother is a grosso.

30
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,300
Belonged to the Scout Group # 909,
Dragons of Fire Patrol.

31
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:03,200
Before it was called only
"Dragons" but wanted York
it was something more spectacular ...

32
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:07,000
Hey York, you know what the
record for most specialties
won in Camp?

33
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,200
49, and so did the Owls
Forest Camp in the past.

34
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:15,300
49 Specialties? In four days?

35
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,200
I know, it's amazing.

36
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:23,500
- Yes, they're like 19, 20 ...
- They are 7, Reggie 7.

37
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Yes, there are 7 Specialties
per person! I knew!

38
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,700
You could win the "Turtle"

39
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,500
Hey, I have the guilt of
Too late! My mom had to
wash the car and go for a haircut.

40
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,500
And that took three hours?

41
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:42,300
Hey, Clint, calm down, we are part of the
team, remember. I want to do
be proud of in this camp.

42
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Kerry, it is assumed that we can not
bring electronics to camp!

43
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,300
Or cell phones!

44
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:57,000
"We cannot hear the
nature if they bring their cell phones! "

45
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,000
I did say that, but ...

46
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,500
I could have called my girlfriend!

47
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,700
I could have called my mom!

48
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,500
It is a call from BP,
pass me the phone.

49
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,200
BP? What is BP?
"Good pancakes?

50
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,200
Baden-Powell?

51
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,700
Who is Baden-Powell?

52
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,500
Do not know who is
Baden-Powell?

53
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,200
Hand me the phone. Is "Well
Prepared on the District Council.

54
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,000
Baden-Powell is
Founder of Scouting.

55
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,700
What? How come you cannot?
Sub-Sos Scoutmaster!
You cannot leave me alone now!

56
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,000
They will not go to the bathroom?

57
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,200
For what?

58
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,200
This is the last stop
urban by the Camp.

59
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,400
And during those days, only
KYBOs can use.

60
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,400
What are the KYBOs?

61
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,000
What are the KYBOs?

62
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:55,000
Reggie, my friend
do not really want to know.

63
00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:03,000
When you hear, you stand up straight
all the hairs on your body,

64
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,500
ask your instinct to escape,

65
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,500
but your body will be paralyzed by
terror, almost on the verge of convulsing

66
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:19,500
your eyes turn white, 
and throat feel dry, like
if it were full of sand.

67
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:25,200
Once you log in, if you cross that
door, you know the real FEAR

68
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:34,500
because inside you know, that about
the Kybo, there's someone lurking,

69
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:43,500
waiting for the opportunity to knock
the Kybo, leaving the occupant helpless

70
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,500
and the Scout is screaming and crying, until
the rest of his Patrol comes to the rescue,

71
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:51,000
and cannot even
finish pooping.

72
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:56,500
Can stand if they want,
but, while this is a station
old and dusty Service,

73
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:00,000
has a comparative luxury bathroom
with which we find there.

74
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,000
The choice is yours.

75
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:07,200
Cute story, York!
Bathrooms Camp
cannot be so bad!

76
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:40,200
We went to Camp Rakhouta one
of the most prestigious camping sites,
respected and old on this side of the Mississippi.

77
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,500
The Scouts were not only
to Rakhouta lived Rakhouta.

78
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,500
All glory, all
spirit, any tradition.

79
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,000
York always told us stories
had lived at Camp Rakhouta,
now going to live our own history.

80
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,700
Scouts! Silence and Attention!

81
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:13,000
Novices, Scouts, Scoutmasters,

82
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,800
welcome to my camp.

83
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:18,000
My name is Mike and I Adler
Country Head Rakhouta.

84
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:25,000
It is a pleasure to welcome you
to be the best day of their lives.

85
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,500
The best days of our lives!

86
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:41,500
Before starting the activities, we will
raising of the Flag, led by Patrol
Polar Bear Ice Cream, # 44 Scout Group.

87
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,300
Attention Patrol Service ...

88
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,000
Marchen ...

89
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Scouts ... firm ...

90
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:06,500
Patrol Service
Flags placed.

91
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,500
Will find
a "gift" in
Camp bathrooms?

92
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,700
That would be disgusting!

93
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
- You're the disgusting.
- You're too disgusting.

94
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Guys, we will not get
at the Opening Ceremony.

95
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,200
Big deal, we will not
to die for that.

96
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:50,500
There is a ceremony either. Are performed
screams from the camp, have the Rod of Spirit
not there is a lack of respect.

97
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:59,800
And, as we are now Fire Dragons, I
I really do things well, so I have
prepared something special for our Patrol:

98
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,700
Red Berets.

99
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,500
One for each suit.

100
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:15,200
You cannot be serious! You're going to make
we use these things? Let's look
cocks! NO I get it!

101
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,700
I think we can still reach
Vara ceremony of the Spirit.

102
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,500
What is the Rod of the Spirit?

103
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,500
Reggie is the main
Rakhouta tradition!

104
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,700
White Feather is the
explained in detail.

105
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:40,500
In 1888, two American explorers,
Henry Phelps and Marcus Fisher, explored
this land, seeking new frontiers.

106
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:50,000
Fisher wrote in his diary, "After
of years of travel, we Indians
have committed a hidden place

107
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:59,000
of extraordinary beauty
where the eagles fly free
watching, guiding ...

108
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,000
See also constantly
big bears, walking vigilant
and protecting this land.

109
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,500
The Indians say they are
Protectors of the Earth Spirits.

110
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
In my life as an explorer
I have seen many beauties: The
exuberance of the tropics

111
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:25,000
imposing the Great Plains, coastal
east and west, but nothing
compares to the beauty of these lands.

112
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,500
These valleys have been really
blessed by God with their beauty.

113
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:37,500
My journey continues and my body must
follow, but my Spirit, will remain
forever in this land.

114
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,500
Rod of the Spirit that we have here
Camp is Rakhouta
same as Fisher used in his travels.

115
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:48,500
Has passed from generation
generation, and all the campers
Rakhouta and live in legend,

116
00:10:50,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Eagle acquire speed and strength
Bear, as the Guardians accompanying
the Spirit of Fisher, and live in the Vara.

117
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Live then, the Legend
Rakhouta camp with the strength
Bear, Eagle and speed.

118
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:12,000
May the spirit of
accompanying guardians.

119
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,400
That camp begins!

120
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:32,500
Ok guys, thanks to Reggie and
their occurrences, we arrived late.

121
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,200
So try to arrive at least
at the end of ceremonies to introduce
to the other patrols and make a good impression.

122
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,400
- But, my backpack?
- Let it be me, Reggie.

123
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,000
- But, my tent?
- Let it be me, Reggie

124
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,200
- But, my toothbrush?
- Reggie!

125
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:52,400
- Come on, guys!
- Kerry, you can download things?

126
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,500
Okay, I'll
load the backpacks ...

127
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,200
- Hey!
- Reggie ...

128
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:11,900
Hello, Dragons?

129
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,500
All right ...

130
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,300
They hold the record ...

131
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,500
Were lost, ladies?

132
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,000
Miss you see any around here?

133
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,200
We are the Fire Dragons.

134
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:40,700
Let's go.

135
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,200
- No hard feelings, eh?
- And without pants!

136
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,500
And our revenge, yes ...

137
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Now I see how many do ...

138
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,200
Oh, God!

139
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,200
What you did to your sandwich?

140
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,700
I did it "Super Shell"

141
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:12,700
What?

142
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,800
Super Shell, I took
all the bread shell.

143
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,200
You have to eat
the shell as well.

144
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,500
Yes I eat,
but separately.

145
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,500
You're crazy.

146
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:28,500
- Why not clothes to match?
- I want to implement a survival technique.

147
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,500
- This patrol will not call us "girls"
- Seriously, no one will.

148
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,200
It seemed too hard.

149
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
- Not so.
- No?

150
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:46,200
Reggie, if we do not respect,
all other patrols bother us
throughout the camp!

151
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:49,500
Want to spend all these days
defending you from abusers?

152
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,200
No, of course not.

153
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:56,500
So just remind you,
that we do not play.

154
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Ok, I got tired of waiting.
Let's use some fuel.

155
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,500
With this light.

156
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:06,700
Call it a lot.

157
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,500
Careful, that's dangerous!

158
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,000
Here comes the Scoutmaster!

159
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,200
- Need help?
- No, thanks.

160
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,500
- How's the fire?
- It will soon be ready.

161
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
- In two minutes at most.
- We are about to turn.

162
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Well done. The pyramid is well armed
they put enough tinder, the fence
security Stone either.

163
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,200
And when you turn it on
friction will be a perfect fire.

164
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:43,000
Yes, I am sure
You can turn it on well.

165
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:47,500
However,
I would like to comment you something:

166
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
It is important that the fire is ready
cooking time, therefore, just use ...

167
00:14:54,500 --> 00:15:01,000
- No, Kerry, do not use matches!
- We prefer to turn that way!

168
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Oh, my God! Kerry!

169
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,800
You okay?

170
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I'm fine, I am the Scoutmaster.

171
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:29,500
A tip: If you put fuel to the fire
must tell all the troops!

172
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,000
Dude, your eyebrows ...

173
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,500
Oh, well ...

174
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,000
Want something cool for ...

175
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,500
I think I better go
to find the kit ...

176
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:53,200
That was ... Incredible!

177
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,500
Oh, my God, they saw his face?

178
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,200
It seemed an alien, ha ha ha!

179
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,500
So what can we
found in the Proveduría?

180
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,500
Basically, everything.

181
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:13,200
- Do not think they have "everything"
- Want to bet?

182
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,500
Wow ...

183
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,200
Which of these is the sharpest?

184
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,400
It.

185
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
- He says "No, my son" ...
- Sorry ...

186
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:50,500
- How much are soguines?
- A million dollars a meter.

187
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:56,200
Just kidding. Dime
meter. Want this?

188
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,500
The multipurpose saw it work?

189
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,500
You think?

190
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
You have tried?

191
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,700
I have to charge you measure it.

192
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,000
How is everything?

193
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,500
- All right.
- How much are these?

194
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:30,200
These are free. Replicas of the Rod
Spirit, that is kept in memory.

195
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,000
- Incredible! Look over there!
- What bombonazo!

196
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,500
- Reggie, come here, 's hide!
- Why? What happens?

197
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,500
- What is the fire?
- She is the fire!

198
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Someone noted above
your basket workshop?

199
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,200
No, not yet ...

200
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,200
Well, it's better to be always ready!

201
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,700
- I scored to Basket!
- Me too!

202
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,900
From now ...

203
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,700
I love the Basket!

204
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,000
Beware, they will break these things!

205
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
What does it matter? They're free!

206
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,300
Ay!

207
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,200
Not even hit you!

208
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,600
But almost hit me!

209
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:47,800
Remember guys, if not
swimmers cannot perform
any aquatic activity.

210
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:56,500
Thus, not only will his Camp
boring, but will be unable
Specialty yield no water.

211
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Now, I can see some of you
are a little worried. "No, that water
must be very cold, I freeze, bua ... "

212
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:18,000
Do not worry! At this time of year
this lake is practically a hot spring!
They add a couple of bubbles and have a jacuzzi.

213
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:38,000
My grandmother is bathed in cold waters, have no
scary! The waters are shallow and very
sun exposure, are really good!

214
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:41,500
At my signal, may enter
for the swimming.

215
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,600
Now begins the function.

216
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:53,000
Wait for my signal
may soon enter ...

217
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,800
May enter upon
exact turn signal ...

218
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,500
It's just a ...

219
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,700
Just a second ...

220
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,200
This trash does not work ...

221
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,500
Now, boys, here comes ...

222
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,700
Done! Water!

223
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:30,000
So much for that mess? Should
simply have said "Tírense!"

224
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Hold our towels, steward.

225
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:38,000
Hey, that's not funny.

226
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,200
Come to the water.

227
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:46,500
These waters are warm, makes
the same speech every year.

228
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,200
What, you do not know how to swim?

229
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,500
No, but the camp is for
kids enjoy it, not me ...

230
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,200
Ok, whatever you want ...

231
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
- Ryan, slip into the water.
- No.

232
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,700
Do you mean? Join this group.

233
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,800
- Do not you remember the last camp?
- Yes, what is?

234
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,700
- There were sharks in the water!
- But that was in the Coast! There is nothing like that here!

235
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,200
- But what if there?
- Get in, nothing!

236
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,500
- No.
- Ryan, Get in the water!

237
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:19,000
You could put your Patrol in the water?
I have other things to do.

238
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:23,500
What is it, Dragon? You afraid
it turns off your fire?

239
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Patrols must work together. If a
your dragons are afraid of getting wet, they will
that all the water out and do something else.

240
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:31,700
- Ryan, slip into the water, I'm here!
- No.

241
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,500
Troopers do not make your case?
What a great guide that you are!

242
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:37,200
I will not repeat it, or put all ...

243
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,500
- Enough, Ryan, water!
- NO!

244
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,500
Full disobedience in
your face, Dragon Guide!

245
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,500
Here you have something to your face!

246
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,200
- I left the half, Dragon.
- We are the Fire Dragons.
- They smell like manure Dragons!

247
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,200
Silence and Attention!

248
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:17,200
Okay, that never happens
Fashion! How about the applause of
Watermelon for Scoutmasters?

249
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,700
So many seeds!

250
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:31,000
- They had a good day?
- Yes!

251
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Ok, before doing the lowering, I
make them reflect on the beauties
We here at Camp Rakhouta.

252
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:55,000
Stop a moment and look around.
Look at God's creation, the magnificent sky,
stars, towering mountains, the lake ...

253
00:22:56,500 --> 00:23:04,000
Year after year, many Scouts as you today
Rakhouta went through in this same land and under
this same sky, and heat of that fire.

254
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,500
Look, feel ... Can you feel the
Spirit? They can live the legend?

255
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,000
All rise, please.

256
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:30,500
Ok, now all my signal, I want to put
full force, all their heart and all your Spirit
to shout the name RAKHOUTA to the mountains.

257
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:37,700
If you want to live the legend should
fully engage should
shouted with all his might.

258
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:40,500
Ready?

259
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:41,700
My sign:

260
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Rakhouta!

261
00:23:51,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Rakhouta ... Rakhouta ... Rakhouta ...

262
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:14,500
That, Scouts, is the Spirit
of Rakhouta, who lives in these
land, and waving,

263
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:19,200
so that you too
leave your mark on history
of our camp.

264
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:29,000
Over the next few days
listen carefully, because
the Spirit could speak ...

265
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:39,000
The soul of Camp Rakhouta
also be composed of
actions from now ...

266
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:44,500
So I ask:
Shares will be worth
to be part of our Spirit?

267
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:51,500
Make sure that each of its
actions, is something worthy of emulation ...

268
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,500
Esfuérzence every day
that is the Scout Spirit.

269
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Can sit.

270
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,200
Is this a joke?

271
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:29,000
Scouts cannot use the Rod
Spirit of jokes
make them happen.

272
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
They just informed me that
Rod is in place.

273
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,500
If it was someone from my Troop I
I will wash dishes for a year!

274
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
- What happened?
- Must be a joker.

275
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:47,000
If any of you know
where is the Rod of Spirit
return it immediately.

276
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:53,200
Do not let something like that ends with
the joy of our camp.

277
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:22,200
- Is it good?
- Yes, brown.

278
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,000
Who will the be taken?

279
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:30,000
Probably the Forest Owls.
Those guys do not know what is respect.

280
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,000
I am sure that, whoever the
is taken, will repent and return.

281
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
You'd better.

282
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,700
Who wants more meringue?

283
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Not me, thanks.

284
00:26:52,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Ok, Troop, I'm tired
I go to sleep. Behave yourselves,
feed the fire, good night.

285
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:04,500
Good night.

286
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,700
I also go to sleep.
We will have a heavy day tomorrow.

287
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:21,500
Good idea.

288
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:29,500
Yes, let's go to sleep. Come?

289
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,200
No, I will make the first call.

290
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,500
Guard?

291
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,000
For what?

292
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,200
By mosquatch not know?

293
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,000
What is a mosquatch?

294
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,500
This is how Henry
Phelps called the monster.

295
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Monster?

296
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:59,500
Yes, it is in the final pages of his diary.
Says that's what killed Fisher.

297
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,700
Although, it really should not
tell you this right now ...

298
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,200
- Yes, I prefer not to know ...
- No, tell us! What happened?

299
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,200
Reggie sounds like
you're scared ...

300
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:17,700
Please my nothing scares me.
I've seen The Goonies on TV

301
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,500
That's not scary!

302
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:27,500
Sure scared! Well,
maybe the Cubs ...

303
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,500
But not me. Except
the type of hook ...

304
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Whatever.

305
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:45,000
When Phelps and Fisher were to leave,
climbed to the top of that cliff ...

306
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:56,000
and Phelps told Fisher he had to go
Nevada, and again in the morning.

307
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,500
Why did you leave?

308
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:01,000
Because he had forgotten something.

309
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:04,500
- And what he had forgotten?
- Do not know.

310
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:08,700
- I could not wait until the next day?
- Reggie, shut up and listen to the story!

311
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,500
So Phelps was prepared to go ...

312
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Fisher said goodbye, not knowing that
would be the last time I would live ...

313
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:27,200
and before he left, he gave his staff

314
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,000
had the same
accompanied on all journeys.

315
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,000
it would become
in the Rod of the Spirit.

316
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:46,500
Fisher was left to sleep
at the top of the cliff, but could not
sleep, something bothered him ...

317
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:52,300
There was something wrong with the trees in the wind
and that sound of something breaking ...

318
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,200
Like when you step on a branch?

319
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:01,200
It could have been that. But that
sound was too loud,
and came from one direction.

320
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:06,000
Fisher felt fear. He was alone
to fight anything.

321
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:12,500
Decided to go down the cliff. While
had found traces of Phelps.

322
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,500
While perceived
a strong smell of pine ....

323
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,500
I also smell!

324
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,000
- That was Clint!
- Very funny, Reggie!

325
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
- Seriously, it smells like pine!
- Yes.

326
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:36,000
So Fisher continued to decline,
looked around and saw nothing but that
persistent sound goes on around him ...

327
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:44,700
Began to flee without knowing why, and
encountered at every step, as if the trees
wanted to stop him in the forest ...

328
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:51,000
The sound was becoming
stronger and the smell of pine,
so I kept running ...

329
00:30:51,500 --> 00:31:00,800
He dared not look back, but I knew
something was chasing him, could feel a
hot breath close to his neck ...

330
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,500
Continued to run, but the root
tripped, then turned around and saw ...

331
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:06,500
a hideous pair of red eyes
who pounced on him!

332
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,500
Was mosquatch!

333
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,700
Ha ha ha, they fell!

334
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:13,000
- For you to hold my leg!?
- You got me why mine?

335
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:16,200
- You're a punk!
- You should have seen their faces!

336
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
What was that?

337
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:19,500
Guys ...

338
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Oh no ...

339
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:30,700
Is the mosquatch!

340
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Run! Run!

341
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,400
It went really well!

342
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:45,200
What's wrong?!

343
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,200
Sorry, I was scared!

344
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,800
Guys, it's over.

345
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,700
- Reggie, I thought do not panic.
- Do not get scared.
- Liar!

346
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,000
Want to explain how
get this?

347
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
- Yes, it's mine, I found it.
- Reggie, do not be silly ...

348
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:13,200
- Calm down ...
- No! Listen: This staff says Reggie
he found, is the Rod of the Spirit!

349
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,500
This is the Rod of the Spirit?

350
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:18,100
- Why you got off?
- Do not know ...

351
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:20,200
The gift gave the Proveduría.

352
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:23,200
These were replicas,
this is true!

353
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:24,600
Did not know!

354
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:28,200
- If the other patrols found out,
take us for fools!
- We need to return.

355
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:30,200
- Now?
- Yes, right now.

356
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:35,200
- But it is past midnight.
- We can not wait until tomorrow?

357
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Ok, we'll do tomorrow. Early!
I do not want anyone to know that we have a
socket on the Dragon Fire!

358
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
"You're not my father"

359
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,200
"You think I'm pretty?"

360
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
"May God bless everyone"

361
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:35,500
"You have my bow, my sword and my ax"

362
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,000
"Let my people go!"

363
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,200
"Black ball in the hole in the corner"

364
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,500
"Wingardium Leviosa"

365
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:51,000
"When the Saints come marching"

366
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,500
- Who are you hiding, doll?
- From you.

367
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,000
It is a hopeless case.

368
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:42,000
Scouts, firm.

369
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,200
Service Patrol, march.

370
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,500
Patrol Service
Flags placed.

371
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:16,700
Greetings, one!

372
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:43,000
Repeat after me the
Pledge of Allegiance

373
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:48,000
Pledge allegiance to the
Flag of my country

374
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:51,000
and to the Republic
it represents.

375
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:56,700
One Nation, under God,
indivisible, with liberty and
justice for all.

376
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,200
Greeting, two!

377
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,500
Patrol Service
be removed.

378
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:11,000
Thanks, Dragon.

379
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,500
Where's Reggie?

380
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,700
Ah ... Behind you.

381
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:26,200
Guys, good job!
They showed great respect
Raising Ceremony on.

382
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:35,000
- How did it go?
- Eh ... well.

383
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,700
Somebody saw you?

384
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,500
Reggie, what happens?

385
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
I need your help.

386
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:47,500
Let's go.

387
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:49,200
- Is everything okay?
- Yes, back then.

388
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:58,200
... and when they removed the trash,
there was a squirrel, eating ...

389
00:36:58,500 --> 00:36:59,900
- Rod?
- Garbage!

390
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:01,700
- Where's the Wand?
- Garbage!

391
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,700
It's amazing, right?
Uh, I found ten cents.
- And where's the Wand?

392
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:17,500
And last night at midnight I woke up wet
and I thought I had made the pi, but was
my canteen that had been spilled ...

393
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,200
- Where's the Wand?
- Look at that butterfly! Oops, that
bird has red feathers ...

394
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,700
- Think you've reached Knight Scout?
- May be ...

395
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:31,500
- Because my mom says I should learn
to handle if you want to be a full Scout, but ...
- Where's the Wand?

396
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:36,000
And when I saw that kid, I thought
I was going to beat me, but ...

397
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:41,500
- Did you threatened?
- No, but his face was so ugly ...

398
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:45,000
Hey, do not worry
not going to spend anything.

399
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:51,500
- But let's talk about that later.
Now, let's get the Rod.
- I know, I know, my Patrol is my Shield.

400
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,200
Yes, we care for one another.

401
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,200
Well, here it is.

402
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,500
Or, I think it was around here ...

403
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:06,500
Where is it?

404
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,200
You put the Rod
Spirit in a tree?

405
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,500
Ah, yes. But no longer.

406
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,200
You sure this is the place?

407
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:27,000
Yes, I think so ... I was coming down
that road and I meet ...

408
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:28,700
Wait! Somebody saw you?

409
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:29,500
Yes

410
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:31,000
Who?

411
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:33,700
I do not know there were three Scouts.

412
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,200
Patrol what they were?

413
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:38,000
I do not know, I said it.

414
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:39,700
They saw you?

415
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Yes, I asked if I
was hiding, I told
yes and then left.

416
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,500
You have to find that Rod.

417
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:50,800
Where are you going? Waiting!

418
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:56,000
We are the Owls
are the Owls,

419
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:59,500
we have a "Buhen" day
we have a "Buhen" day

420
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,500
- I would not have ruined.
- Yes, I'd ruined.

421
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,200
Good morning, Dragons, Always Ready!

422
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:06,800
We are the Dragons of Fire!

423
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Raising Good, Dragons, where
believe that we are in the Army?

424
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:16,500
- You have to respect national symbols.
- That you did your brother? Where got?

425
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:18,200
Is burning your
Patrol Corner.

426
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Look dwarf, do not mess with
Owls in the Forest ...

427
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:24,600
Who?

428
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:25,900
With the Forest Owls!

429
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:26,700
Who?

430
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,800
With the Forest Owls!

431
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,200
The "Buhen?

432
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Enough.

433
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:36,500
You're lucky that
Cubs will not stick to.

434
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:50,500
Scouts Okay, welcome
for target practice.

435
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:53,000
My name is Stan Gallagher.
Leslie, stop the music.

436
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,700
In the next few hours, will be
MY world, where there are two rules:

437
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:05,200
1. I give the orders. 2. What I say, it is,
not to kill anyone, okay?

438
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:10,500
Unable to handle weapons if they do not pay
attention and not follow the rules,

439
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:15,000
they have been whole and do not want
return as a gruyere cheese.

440
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:25,200
Ok, the first to be made funny, receive
My Assistant Leslie a stick over his head and
immediate expulsion from the camp, right Leslie?

441
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:26,500
Absolutely!

442
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:33,500
Any questions? No, no questions
ask later. Understood?

443
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,900
- I asked if they understood.
- Yes!

444
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,300
- Yes, why?
- Yes, Lord!

445
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:41,000
- Yes, Mr. Stan.
- Yes, Mr. Stan.

446
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,300
- What?
- Yes, Mr. Stan.

447
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:50,500
Okay, not going to touch the rifles to
tell them to do so, nor will they shoot
until told to do so,

448
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:56,000
not going to breathe until I tell you
they do, understand? Because this is my
world, who does not obey, he dies.

449
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:58,700
- Start practicing!
- Roger!

450
00:40:59,000 --> 00:40:59,700
Prepare ...

451
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Aim ... Fire!

452
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,500
Nice shot! Shoot! Very good, continue!

453
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:10,800
What is the problem?

454
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:15,000
Recharge ... Ceasefire!

455
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:18,400
Rod returned?

456
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
What?

457
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,200
Rod could return?

458
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,500
No, Rod was lost.

459
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,200
Lost? What happened?

460
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:35,000
- Do not know. It seems that
another patrol took her.
- Who?

461
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:38,800
I do not know, Reggie says
saw some Scouts.

462
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,200
Reggie, who saw?

463
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,200
- What?
- Beware!

464
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,200
- Sorry ...
- Rifles always in front!

465
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:48,200
- My grandfather said
we should put the rifle ...
- Charge!

466
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:58,500
Leaning on the shoulder, hence
point y. .. Yes, in that position,
point, and then shoot.

467
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:04,200
- Although never shoot
anything, we practiced with cans ...
- So you've never fired.

468
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:10,000
Look, I do not know who's Vara
but it is our responsibility to return it.

469
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:13,500
Why us? No
known to us had.

470
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:18,700
Whoever it is carried saw
Reggie, and will tell everybody.

471
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:21,000
That dishonor us for life.

472
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:23,400
That's not good.

473
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,200
Who will do something like that?

474
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:30,000
Maybe it was the crickets Cantores
Polar Bears and Ice Cream ...
Combat Or Yaks!

475
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Or maybe the Forest Owls,
for having dropped his pants
one of their patrol.

476
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:37,500
- Yes, they should be
wanting revenge!
- Why?

477
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
- Because ...
- Never mind, it already happened.

478
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:44,200
It will cost us care for our
reputation, not the other Patrols
we have exactly love.

479
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,500
Hey, do not know who has the Vara.

480
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:54,700
The only thing we have to
do is stay alert.

481
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:59,000
If you see or hear something,
Keep calm, and let me know.

482
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Then recover
and return.

483
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,000
Anyone have a better idea?

484
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:10,200
Ok, then we will do that.

485
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:15,500
And I learn a lot from
guys, is really good.

486
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:18,200
- Long have
Scoutmaster sos?
- Three years ago.

487
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:20,000
- Really?
- Yes, indeed.

488
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:24,200
- How old are you?
- 31.

489
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:26,200
Want to reach 32? Then
Shut up and let me work.

490
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:31,500
Focus!

491
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:33,500
Hey York!

492
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
This is my world ...

493
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:48,500
So we wet the fiber
before passing it through the media.

494
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:55,200
They must be careful not to twist
fiber, or the basket will be deformed

495
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:57,500
Basketry and may not approve.

496
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:02,000
Reggie, is here any
which you saw with the Rod?

497
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:08,700
- I had not noticed ...
- For fijate!

498
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:11,700
Hey, why you do not
yet begun?

499
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:15,300
It is enough, I quit!

500
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,000
- Learn how.
- Hey, that yes it is cute!

501
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:23,000
Ok, Scouts, listen.

502
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:33,200
I will turn my canoe. Their job is
to get this far, rescue, and carry the canoe
to the bank, without turning your own canoe. Ok?

503
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,800
- Who goes first?
- Us.

504
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:40,500
I like that! A brave Patrol!
Here we go, rescue me ....

505
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:46,000
Wow! What good is the water!

506
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:55,200
It's so hot that if I put
noodle soup would be made!

507
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,500
Okay, come on
side, do not be afraid ...

508
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:01,200
Is this the guy?

509
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:03,200
What guy?

510
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:08,200
Forest Owl, who stopped you
on the road. Clint told me everything.

511
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:09,700
Yes

512
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,000
How did you cope?

513
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,500
I only see stupid
over all his Patrol.

514
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:15,500
- But how?
- Do not know.

515
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,200
- AJ defended you?
- No, I did it myself.

516
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:20,400
And now what do we do?

517
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:24,700
We have to make them pay.

518
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:26,200
Why?

519
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:27,800
Because I threatened.

520
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:29,200
Nothing happened.

521
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:31,000
Do not be silly!

522
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:32,500
Tonto why?

523
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:35,200
Threatened you in front of the whole Patrol!

524
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,200
Not even scared me.

525
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:39,000
Not understand it, Jared.

526
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:44,200
We are a patrol, if anyone messes with
any of us gets to everyone!

527
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,500
I'm just trying to protect,
I do not want anyone hurt you.

528
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
Okay, but why do you think
I can not defend yourself?

529
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:54,200
Because you never do.

530
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:56,700
But this time it did!

531
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
Okay guys
very good rescue!

532
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:05,200
Should have brought my
skies, what a great trailer!

533
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:08,400
We will do
better go!

534
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:40,000
"You all stand up straight
the hairs on your body ... "

535
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:46,000
"Your eyes turn white,
and throat feel dry, like
if it were full of sand ... "

536
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:57,000
"Your instinct will tell you to escape,
but your body will be paralyzed by
terror, almost ready to convulse "

537
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:02,800
"Once you log in, if you cross that
door, you know the real FEAR "

538
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:13,000
"Because inside you know, that about
Kybo, there is someone watching, waiting
the opportunity to overthrow the Kybo "

539
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:25,000
"And the Scout is screaming and crying, until
the rest of his Patrol comes to the rescue,
and can not even finish pooping "

540
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,200
I can wait!

541
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:44,000
Anyone want candy?

542
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:46,700
That will send them ...

543
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
This device is
very good, Jared.

544
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:54,000
Reggie, cut it!

545
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,200
If you floor it, I
slip and kill me!

546
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:59,500
- Not just me doing it!
- Who else?

547
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:03,700
- Anyone else ...
- God!

548
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:11,000
- Thanks, Poseidon!
- Sorry ...

549
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:13,100
They are ready to sleep, Miss?

550
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:17,200
York! York! I do it?
He told us ladies!

551
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,500
Do what, Reggie?

552
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:24,500
- The other time someone
told us ladies, York ...
- Reggie ...

553
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:27,500
No, what happened?
What did they do?

554
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:32,500
York pulled down his pants.

555
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:35,000
Reggie, please!

556
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:40,000
Okay, it's good
who can defend.

557
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:42,500
- Well, I would never do that.
- Yeah, me neither.

558
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:48,200
Okay, Jared, but
sometimes you have to leave
clear that one can not play.

559
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:52,500
All right, everybody to sleep,
and no flutter by.

560
00:48:57,500 --> 00:49:04,000
You know, once I dropped my pants
someone. Once I fought with someone
also, for a girl.

561
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:05,800
As Instructor
basketries?

562
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Yes

563
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:10,100
She looked at me with affection.

564
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:14,200
Impossible! I was looking
MY fondly. I saw her.

565
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:16,300
What?

566
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,700
Why would you look at yourself?

567
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:23,000
I do not know, maybe I just
could not resist my charms.

568
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
You're delusional, would look at a frog before.

569
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:29,500
I know I was looking at me.

570
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:32,100
And how are you so sure
you looked at yourself?

571
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:34,200
Saquémonos doubt:
I'll ask.

572
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:38,000
No! AJ, that's not fair!

573
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:39,200
Right?

574
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:41,000
Are you sure you talk
you will love.

575
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,500
And, what's the problem?

576
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:46,500
I am sure
I was looking at me ...

577
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
Silence! At my signal ...

578
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:10,000
Reggie, stop spitting!

579
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:12,000
- Cut!
- What is it?

580
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:14,200
Hey!

581
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:18,400
Wait, you do not know what
may be out there!

582
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:25,600
I'll catch them!

583
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,100
They had better run!

584
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:41,000
Who already are! Tomorrow
arrange accounts!

585
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,500
The shoes
have achieved.

586
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,200
- Who were they?
- It does not matter.

587
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:57,000
- Were caught?
- No, they escaped.

588
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,500
- But who were they?
- It does not matter.

589
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,500
- What matters is that he was somebody.
- What do you mean?

590
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:10,500
These things should not happen.
They cannot come and attack us like that!

591
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:14,000
We are the Dragons of Fire!
We have to earn respect!

592
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:18,000
Have something to do with the Rod?

593
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:21,200
Even so, they have no right
to disturb this!

594
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
Maybe they learned
we have the Rod.

595
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:25,800
We had it!

596
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:29,500
Guys, do not understand!

597
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,200
This is not the wand,
is respect!

598
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:39,000
We have taken for fools, not
we are doing anything about it.

599
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,700
Basketry was recorded in only
because the instructor is cute?

600
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:46,700
Ryan does not get to fresh water because it has
fear of sharks saltwater!

601
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,000
We do not need nobody to make us
look bad, we ourselves
do well!

602
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:56,800
We took the greatest treasure
Rakhouta camp, and let
someone else we hand it off!

603
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,500
We can not leave
to keep things well,

604
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:04,500
or continue to haunt us!

605
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:08,500
And what about the Raising that
guided? That did not do well?

606
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:10,200
I do not think that counts ...

607
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:16,500
If you like to be awake
bombuchazos at midnight, I think
perfect. But I can not live like this.

608
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:28,900
And then, what are we doing?

609
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:37,000
Be Prepared!

610
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:41,500
A sleep!

611
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:45,500
- Wait, I'm still not ready!
- Sorry ...

612
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:01,000
Reggie!

613
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:04,000
Okay, I'm ready.

614
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:07,700
Good night.

615
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:11,700
What is "hovering"?

616
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:22,000
Going well, Reggie, Keep it in
pan, to cook well.

617
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:38,700
Keep it in the pan.

618
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:41,700
- Jared, for breakfast.
- I have no hunger!

619
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:50,000
Ok, I show you how you have
to do: Once you are
gilt, the turn around y. ..

620
00:53:55,000 --> 00:54:03,500
If you drop of bacon grease on clothing,
is very difficult to remove, so tené
careful not to get dirty.

621
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:12,700
Keep it in the pan! Oil
jump and you can burn!

622
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:21,500
- Anybody want eggs?
- No. ..

623
00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:24,000
- Eggs, Ryan?
- No, thanks.

624
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:30,000
- Clint, eggs? Today will be a day
heavy, need protein ...
- No, thanks.

625
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:40,000
- AJ, eggs?
- No thanks, I'm vegetarian.
- Ok, more for me ...

626
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:44,300
These eggs are very good!

627
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:47,400
Come on guys, I have a gift for you.
Keep your eyes open.

628
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:49,300
The symphony of proteins.

629
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:51,100
- These are for you.
- Thanks.

630
00:54:51,100 --> 00:54:52,500
All of these eggs for me!

631
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:54,000
Ryan, be brave.

632
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:57,500
- These are going to do well.
- Ok.

633
00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:01,200
Roger, good luck.

634
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:06,400
A win!

635
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:11,500
- To my favorite Scoutmaster.
- Tomorrow you cook.
- Yes, sir.

636
00:55:16,700 --> 00:55:20,200
Novices, Scouts, Scoutmasters ...

637
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:24,000
Who wants to make a
Camp cry?

638
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:30,200
Okay, let's start with
The worker bees!

639
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:35,500
- Why Buzz?
- Because we want!

640
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:38,700
- Why chop?
- We are hot!

641
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:42,300
- Why are "yellow" (cowards)?
- Not we!

642
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:55,500
We are the Road Runner!
Eat our dust! Beep! Beep!

643
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:01,000
We are the Yaks of
Fight! Attack!

644
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:03,300
Okay, guys, well done!

645
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:10,500
- This is not to win badges.
- Neither of Knots.

646
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:14,200
- Not to walk much.
- Walnut squirrels are crazy!

647
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,200
Forward Chipmunks!

648
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:30,000
Squirrels ... Squirrels ... Squirrels ...

649
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,500
It's true ... They are totally crazy!

650
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:37,300
Are you ready?

651
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:39,500
Reggie ...

652
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:44,200
- Yes Sir, we're ready.
- Okay, go ahead then.

653
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:48,000
- Hey Reggie, use this.

654
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:55,000
- Ready? Let's make
Camp better cry!
- Yes, we are ready ...

655
00:56:55,500 --> 00:56:58,000
Put on the glasses. Ready?

656
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:06,500
Guess Who's Coming?

657
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,000
Here they come!

658
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,400
Fire Dragons arrived here
and are all ready to say,

659
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:14,600
If you mess with us will pay,
be friends, or out of here!

660
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:19,000
If you're feeling bad and you know rap,
Think it twice, I'll show you!

661
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:25,500
At Camp we play,
and in any competition the first place!

662
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:30,300
At Camp needs to be done,
over the Dragons, nobody can beat!

663
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:37,000
And everyone knows it, and everyone sees it,
the best rate, the Dragons have it!

664
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:43,000
So come on guys, are not thieves,
and give a good round of applause for the Dragons!

665
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:51,000
Forward Dragons! Yes!

666
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:57,000
So, the Dragons have fire
in the mouth and rhythm in her blood!

667
00:57:57,800 --> 00:57:59,300
Now that was rapping!

668
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:20,500
- Roger! You just watch! Go and tell!
- I can not! I'm scared to death!

669
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,200
Where are you going?

670
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:35,200
- Hello!
- Hello ...

671
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:01,400
Hello!

672
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:03,700
Hello ...

673
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:07,500
- How are you?
- All right. Vos?

674
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,500
- All right.
- Ok.

675
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:13,200
What are you doing?

676
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:19,500
- Only leather work
we had to do ...
- I like, is very nice.

677
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,400
It represents the love I have for ...

678
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:32,500
- What?
- He said ...

679
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:37,000
Your friend said you wanted me
ask me anything.

680
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:43,000
No, not really, it's nothing.

681
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,500
Wait! In fact, there is something.

682
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,200
I think you're very cute.

683
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:59,000
I was thinking ... Perhaps at some point
now or after the Camp ...

684
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:06,000
We might, go to
watch a movie or something ...

685
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,200
That's a yes or no?

686
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:38,000
No sharks in fresh water.

687
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:40,000
No sharks in fresh water.

688
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:46,000
Yes that is me fighting back!
It's quite a monster!

689
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:57,500
Do not you run away, do not leak!
Yes, it seems like one big,
must have eaten too much!

690
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:03,200
You're the one who must have eaten
the 17 Scouts who disappeared from
Camp last season!

691
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:05,400
No escape ...

692
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:07,500
"A Scout smiles and sings
even in difficulties "

693
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:10,500
You'll end up in my frying pan!

694
01:01:11,700 --> 01:01:16,500
Rakhoutaaa!!

695
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:32,500
Ops, I hope that
Scout can swim ...

696
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:38,000
I do not want to escape
a piece so big!

697
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:45,500
I must be brave, I must be brave
I must be brave ...

698
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:49,200
Thanks!

699
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:53,000
You swim like a shark!

700
01:01:54,500 --> 01:01:56,000
Well done!

701
01:02:03,700 --> 01:02:04,700
Great!

702
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:06,500
Now we pay the
Aquatic Specialties.

703
01:02:07,900 --> 01:02:09,100
Go to change you.

704
01:02:10,700 --> 01:02:13,200
The sandwiches are really good
when you do "Super Shell"

705
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
Yes, it's amazing!

706
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:19,000
- You did your pancho Super Peel?
- Yes.

707
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:21,000
I wish I had happened to me!

708
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:36,800
- Clint, are you okay?
- Yes

709
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:39,500
- Bye Kerry.
- Goodbye ...

710
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:44,000
- Is that what I think it was?
- Went to the bathroom alone!

711
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:46,000
We must achieve if we
get it back in one piece!

712
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
You got to make cake?

713
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:56,200
Wait for me!

714
01:02:56,500 --> 01:02:57,500
We'll be back.

715
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
- Is rich.
- Chau Kerry.

716
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,500
What nice guys!

717
01:03:11,700 --> 01:03:12,500
I have a hurry!

718
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:19,200
- That was not Dragon Patrol?
- Yes, and had toilet paper.

719
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:21,500
- Go to KYBOs.
- Follow him!

720
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,000
Guys ...

721
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:28,500
- Where were they?
- With my future wife!

722
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,900
Seriously? The Instructor
Basketry? That caramelito?

723
01:03:32,100 --> 01:03:39,700
Not a caramelito. It is a bombonazo! Chocolate
hot sweet and falling on my lips ... After
see, I can not call "nice" to anyone else in the world!

724
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:41,000
You gonna call?

725
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,200
Man! This girl is writing!

726
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:48,400
Hey, let's go!

727
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:51,000
- What happens?
- Clint went to the KYBOs, alone!

728
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:54,000
Please!

729
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,800
Should have gone in
Service Station!

730
01:04:09,500 --> 01:04:11,800
Forest owls!
Kybo hide yourselves behind!

731
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:17,500
Disperse in silence!

732
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,700
Forward, slowly ... Get down.

733
01:04:28,300 --> 01:04:32,000
- Must be more behind the KYBOs.
- Reggie! Shh!

734
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:39,500
I told him it was in the
Service Station!

735
01:04:39,700 --> 01:04:41,300
That was four days ago!

736
01:04:41,500 --> 01:04:43,500
Silence! Could listen!

737
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
A dragon in there?

738
01:04:48,500 --> 01:04:52,500
Come on, I left! We want
teach us to rap!

739
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:58,500
I left it now This is no time
keep your eyes open.

740
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
Keep your eyes open?

741
01:05:02,300 --> 01:05:05,200
Kybo "Keep Your Bowls Open"
(Keep your eyes open)

742
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:08,200
- Ah, I see!
- Shh!

743
01:05:11,500 --> 01:05:16,000
- Hey!
- Ohh, looks like it
there anybody in there!

744
01:05:16,500 --> 01:05:18,000
Whose hide, doll?

745
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:21,500
Hey, those are the Scouts who saw me!

746
01:05:22,700 --> 01:05:23,700
You see?

747
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:27,000
Yes, when I had the Rod of the Spirit!

748
01:05:27,500 --> 01:05:28,500
Are you sure?

749
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:35,000
Yes, he also called me
"Doll", I remember it well.

750
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:42,000
Brother, are many.

751
01:05:42,500 --> 01:05:45,500
Better. It will take several to stop!

752
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:52,000
Hey, you!

753
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,500
- Sorry ...
- Shut up!

754
01:05:57,800 --> 01:05:58,800
Watch the door.

755
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:02,500
They have three seconds to take the
most important decision of their lives.

756
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,500
Oh yeah? What do you do?

757
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
I'll see you all!

758
01:07:04,700 --> 01:07:06,400
Dragons!

759
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:27,800
Now we will see who is the best!

760
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,200
Fly with your wings, Dragon!

761
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:34,700
You have stolen the Rod of the Spirit!

762
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,300
And you took it away!

763
01:07:39,700 --> 01:07:42,200
Of course not! Tu
Tommy was left in a tree!

764
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
Will throw the Kybo!

765
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,500
You have it! Where is it?

766
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,500
I tell you do not have it! It's true!

767
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:04,500
CONFESAL! I know you took it away!

768
01:08:05,700 --> 01:08:08,500
I tell you no! On my Honor Scout!

769
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:21,500
Scout's Honor ...

770
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:26,500
- Clint! Done?
- Yes!

771
01:08:27,500 --> 01:08:30,000
Boys, you know what to do ... Now!

772
01:09:06,500 --> 01:09:08,000
How do you know that they
really do not?

773
01:09:08,500 --> 01:09:09,500
I just know.

774
01:09:10,500 --> 01:09:12,200
I could see in her eyes.

775
01:09:13,500 --> 01:09:16,000
One cannot lie in
a moment like that.

776
01:09:16,500 --> 01:09:17,700
I think so.

777
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
No. I swore by his Honor Scout.

778
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:22,000
While they were fighting.

779
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:27,200
I do not think we violated the law both
Patrol. We will have our
differences, but both are Scouts.

780
01:09:28,500 --> 01:09:30,000
I have to find that Rod.

781
01:09:37,800 --> 01:09:38,800
Hey ...

782
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:42,200
I think it's here!

783
01:09:43,500 --> 01:09:44,500
What?

784
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,500
Yes, this is where
Reggie says he left the Rod!

785
01:10:00,900 --> 01:10:02,100
It's crazy!

786
01:10:03,500 --> 01:10:07,500
- I cannot see anything!
- We want you to bring a flashlight?
- No. ..

787
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:16,500
I cannot believe we
Rakhouta lost the Spirit!

788
01:10:17,500 --> 01:10:18,700
Rod are you referring to?

789
01:10:21,500 --> 01:10:23,500
Everything is so different from last year ...

790
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:28,200
Our patrol was more ... together.

791
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
Always trying to outdo ...

792
01:10:35,200 --> 01:10:36,700
And I keep thinking that ...

793
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
This year, we have not done anything good!

794
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,300
What legacy are we leaving
for future Scouts?

795
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:57,000
York, who cares who took the wand?

796
01:10:58,500 --> 01:10:59,700
What do you mean?

797
01:11:00,500 --> 01:11:03,000
Well, it's just a stick.

798
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:07,000
Yes, you're right.

799
01:11:08,900 --> 01:11:10,400
Nobody knows that we take it off.

800
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:20,000
So back home,
without saying anything, and we could
save our reputation, right?

801
01:11:20,500 --> 01:11:24,500
York, I mean it's just a stick.

802
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:40,000
Rod of the Spirit of Camp
Rakhouta is a symbol ...

803
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:42,700
I must be brave, I must be brave ...

804
01:11:42,900 --> 01:11:46,500
... Which represents the strength of
Bear and Eagle speed ...

805
01:11:46,700 --> 01:11:49,300
- If you talk, surely conquer.
- And what is the problem?

806
01:11:49,500 --> 01:11:53,000
... Is the greatest treasure and the largest
Rakhouta Camp pride ...

807
01:11:53,200 --> 01:11:55,000
Go ahead, Rakhouta!

808
01:11:55,200 --> 01:11:57,200
... Which reminds us of what it represents.

809
01:11:57,300 --> 01:11:59,800
- Is that you never defend ...
- This time I defended myself!

810
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:05,000
... For all Scouts
camp out here, get the force
Bear and Eagle speed.

811
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:16,200
You're right, it's just a stick!

812
01:12:18,700 --> 01:12:20,700
- Let's go to sleep!
- Definitely.

813
01:12:32,200 --> 01:12:34,500
- And if someone sees us?
- It does not matter.

814
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,700
- And if we get into trouble?
- It does not matter.

815
01:12:46,500 --> 01:12:49,200
- Come on, guys.
- Wácala, sticky ...

816
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:53,700
Reggie, get comfortable on
handkerchief, and suddenly the middle.

817
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,800
Ok, enfrentémosnos to
consequences of our actions.

818
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:06,700
Reggie, I'm going to talk. And remember,
no matter what happens, always
Fire Dragons will be.

819
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:11,500
Go ahead.

820
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:14,300
Hi guys.

821
01:13:15,500 --> 01:13:18,500
Come in, come. How are you?
Glad to see them ...

822
01:13:19,500 --> 01:13:22,000
Your Dragon Patrol has left us
impressed these days.

823
01:13:22,300 --> 01:13:23,700
- We are Dragons of Fire!
- Ah, yes.

824
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:27,000
We've been having fun,
so expressed in the song
what we did in Rakhouta.

825
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:31,500
That is fine. Should be fun and
learn, that's the idea of ??the Camp.

826
01:13:31,700 --> 01:13:33,700
Will have several stories
have when they return home.

827
01:13:33,900 --> 01:13:35,200
You bet it does.

828
01:13:35,500 --> 01:13:36,600
Very good, very good.

829
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:40,700
How they fare with
Camp activities?

830
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:45,200
Very good! One of the boys
Audrey got the phone.
It's pure chocolate!

831
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:47,000
Chocolate?

832
01:13:47,200 --> 01:13:52,000
As a chocolate,
hot sweet and falling on my lips ...

833
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:55,000
What a good boy!

834
01:13:57,800 --> 01:13:59,300
I can help you?

835
01:14:02,200 --> 01:14:06,000
Lord, it was our patrols the
which was the Rod of the Spirit.

836
01:14:10,500 --> 01:14:15,700
It was an accident, I took her thinking
I was one of the replicas ...

837
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:18,700
We had been before ...

838
01:14:20,200 --> 01:14:25,000
but did not want it all
Scouts we know that
such fools in our Patrol!

839
01:14:33,300 --> 01:14:34,500
I see.

840
01:14:49,500 --> 01:14:55,500
This Patrol cut a tree,
Kybo fell just above, while
his Scoutmaster was inside.

841
01:14:58,700 --> 01:15:03,200
These two eight canoes sank
while in the camp!

842
01:15:03,700 --> 01:15:07,000
When they returned to their homes, swimming
better than an Olympic medalist!

843
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:09,400
This Patrol ...

844
01:15:12,700 --> 01:15:21,700
... They had to sleep in wet bags
because someone accidentally spilled
canteens all over them.

845
01:15:22,500 --> 01:15:24,500
This is You?

846
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:29,500
Believe me, if the Spirit of Rakhouta
could be ruined by errors
committed by the Scouts,

847
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:31,500
this camp would
closed many years ago ...

848
01:15:32,200 --> 01:15:38,500
Rod is a very important symbol
for the camp, but more important
Scouts are learning from him.

849
01:15:39,500 --> 01:15:41,700
I am proud that they
had the courage to come
return personally.

850
01:15:43,400 --> 01:15:44,400
Is ...

851
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:47,000
Where is it?

852
01:15:48,500 --> 01:15:49,700
We lost.

853
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,300
I'm not the only one
to know about it.

854
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:14,500
Novices, Scouts and Scoutmasters.

855
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
What wonderful days we spent!

856
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:22,000
Field Headquarters
has enjoyed as much as you
These days we spent together,

857
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:32,500
We have had wonderful experiences, and we
learned together to be more respectful of
Nature and tradition, and ourselves.

858
01:16:33,500 --> 01:16:36,500
So who wants to delight
Camp with their cries?

859
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:45,200
What is your name?
What is your name?

860
01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:47,000
What sound do?

861
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,500
Crickets are the singers! Yes!

862
01:16:57,300 --> 01:17:00,000
I love you guys! You make me happy!

863
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:10,500
We are the Polar Bear Ice Cream,
not that we are lazy, is
we're frozen! Brrr!

864
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:16,200
To this should
remove to the Uniform!

865
01:17:17,500 --> 01:17:21,000
And now, a message
Fire Dragons.

866
01:17:24,500 --> 01:17:25,500
It's time.

867
01:18:05,500 --> 01:18:06,500
Those are my boys!

868
01:18:24,500 --> 01:18:28,200
In fact we will not do
a Camp Gulch.

869
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:40,500
Just wanted to say it was our
Patrol which took the Rod of the Spirit.

870
01:18:48,300 --> 01:18:49,500
Are the worst!

871
01:18:50,500 --> 01:18:53,500
Keep calm, York, finished speaking.

872
01:18:55,000 --> 01:19:00,000
One of our Scouts
took it by mistake, and we lost.

873
01:19:01,500 --> 01:19:04,500
What? How is that possible?

874
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:06,500
It was not intentional.

875
01:19:09,700 --> 01:19:11,800
- They are a disgrace!
- Tell them it was an accident!

876
01:19:13,500 --> 01:19:16,500
They are a disgrace to
Scouting around!

877
01:19:17,500 --> 01:19:18,700
It's all we had to say.

878
01:19:20,500 --> 01:19:22,000
Come on guys, that's all.

879
01:19:22,500 --> 01:19:26,500
Get lost! Manga's useless!

880
01:19:28,500 --> 01:19:34,200
Were right to tell the truth,
and I'm proud of you for that.

881
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:50,600
Fire Dragons showed
great value to take care of their mistakes.

882
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:54,500
Stayed together
as a real Patrol.

883
01:19:57,200 --> 01:20:03,200
Although the Rod of the Spirit has been lost,
Camp Spirit Rakhouta endure.

884
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:19,300
We had still a long way
Scouts to be exemplary

885
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:24,500
we then several more camps,
earn more badges, including some
of us become Knights Scout.

886
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:30,000
But it was from that moment, from
that York gave us this important lesson,

887
01:20:30,500 --> 01:20:35,000
that each of us went
to make every effort, from that day.

888
01:20:36,700 --> 01:20:40,700
Okay, now we must continue
Screams from the camp.

889
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:42,200
It is up to the Fire Dragons.

890
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:44,700
Adelante!
