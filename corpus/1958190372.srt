1
00:00:00,099 --> 00:00:01,226
(broadcast signal)

2
00:00:01,226 --> 00:00:04,110
(retro muzak)

3
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:08,040
- What sounds did I silence in the edit?

4
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:10,516
Here's what got cut from

5
00:00:10,516 --> 00:00:14,649
- [Sam and Audience] Make Some Noise!

6
00:00:14,649 --> 00:00:18,066
(upbeat music)

7
00:00:25,574 --> 00:00:28,050
- You asked for it and
so here it is again,

8
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:32,520
a very special, cut-for-time
episode of Make Some Noise.

9
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,267
And so I answer again,
"Why would I cut anything

10
00:00:36,267 --> 00:00:38,640
out of these improv masterpieces?"

11
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,736
The answer, more or less,

12
00:00:40,736 --> 00:00:43,890
to turn them into said masterpieces.

13
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:46,530
See improv is by its
very nature, a crapshoot,

14
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:49,069
which is why this episode
won't be everything I cut,

15
00:00:49,069 --> 00:00:51,510
not by a long shot, but instead the stuff

16
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:53,580
that was... on the bubble.

17
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:58,170
Firstly, because it was
just plain unsuccessful.

18
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:00,000
Most of these prompts
don't end in laughter,

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,132
but here is a rare
instance of one that did.

20
00:01:03,132 --> 00:01:05,610
(upbeat xylophone riff)

21
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:06,570
Zac and Brennan.

22
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:08,040
- Okay, okay.

23
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,680
- A school paper and
the plagiarized version

24
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:15,680
of that same paper with
only a few words changed.

25
00:01:16,097 --> 00:01:20,505
- To Kill a Mockingbird
is the story not only

26
00:01:20,505 --> 00:01:24,090
of a group of children
living in the American south,

27
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:28,920
but of the justice system that
they realize they will come

28
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:33,222
to inherit and the
strife that that brings.

29
00:01:33,222 --> 00:01:35,305
(laughing)

30
00:01:37,794 --> 00:01:40,377
uh... (all laughing)

31
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:45,119
- To Kill a Mockingbird is the story of

32
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,019
(laughing) children in America...

33
00:01:48,928 --> 00:01:51,629
uh, and...

34
00:01:51,629 --> 00:01:55,345
their times and, and, can
I read your part again?

35
00:01:55,345 --> 00:01:57,695
their times and, and, can
I read your part again?

36
00:01:57,695 --> 00:02:00,900
(all laughing)

37
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:02,730
Can you just read your part again?

38
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:07,710
- The character of
Atticus Finch stands tall

39
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:10,140
in the narrative of this story.

40
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:12,060
- The character of Atticus Finch

41
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,477
is the tallest man I've ever seen.

42
00:02:14,477 --> 00:02:15,410
(laughing)

43
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:17,070
This guy's huge.

44
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:21,570
- Meanwhile, the figure
of Boo Radley looms

45
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:24,810
as a commentary and a metaphor.

46
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:26,934
- Boo! Did I Radley ya?

47
00:02:26,934 --> 00:02:29,484
(all laughing)

48
00:02:29,484 --> 00:02:34,484
- By following the legal drama unfolding

49
00:02:34,717 --> 00:02:38,130
within the context of
a coming-of-age story,

50
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:40,890
we are able to paint a picture

51
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:44,043
of this part of American life.

52
00:02:45,782 --> 00:02:47,229
- (sighs) Oh brother.

53
00:02:47,229 --> 00:02:49,229
(all laughing)

54
00:02:49,229 --> 00:02:51,180
- I'll cut you off there.

55
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,950
It turned out to be the prompt

56
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:57,030
of the student who could not successfully

57
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:00,030
plagiarize his classmate's paper.

58
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:03,480
- Probably more than a few
words off, I would say.

59
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,950
There's a moment when you started talking

60
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:07,947
where I was like, "Oh, I- I lost it."

61
00:03:07,947 --> 00:03:09,447
- I fully lost it.

62
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:13,110
- Secondly, obscurity.

63
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:15,720
Because I felt the joke was too obscure,

64
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:20,720
too inside-baseball, too my
taste and my taste alone.

65
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:23,220
Here's Josh Ruben doing an impression

66
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:27,570
that's just for me, Brian
and SungWon answering

67
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:30,690
a very dry prompt, if I do say so myself,

68
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:35,675
and Jake and Vic doing a bit
of Hollywood industry humor.

69
00:03:35,675 --> 00:03:38,790
(upbeat xylophone riff)

70
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:42,060
Josh, Christoph Waltz threateningly offers

71
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:43,853
to shovel your driveway.

72
00:03:43,853 --> 00:03:47,538
- Hello, I notice it's getting
a little bit frosty outside,

73
00:03:47,538 --> 00:03:50,070
- Hello, I notice it's getting
a little bit frosty outside,

74
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:54,445
so I thought maybe I'd
bring over a big metal piece

75
00:03:54,445 --> 00:03:57,540
so I thought maybe I'd
bring over a big metal piece

76
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:00,933
of equipment and scrape
it all off to your liking

77
00:04:00,933 --> 00:04:02,910
of equipment and scrape
it all off to your liking

78
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,786
to make it safe.

79
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:10,410
That's a bingo!
(all laughing)

80
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:14,403
Merry, Merry Christmas.
Don't forget the cream.

81
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:17,130
- Don't forget the cream?

82
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:18,120
- Don't forget the cream?

83
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,960
- It's a reference from
the first film that I did

84
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:26,130
with Quentin Tarantino,
Inglourious Basterds.

85
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:29,580
There was a scene when I said,
"Don't forget the cream,"

86
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:32,953
to Mélanie Laurent,
who is a great actress.

87
00:04:32,953 --> 00:04:34,920
(all laughing)

88
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,200
- I'll take your word for it, Josh.

89
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,698
Brian and SungWon.

90
00:04:39,698 --> 00:04:43,740
Two nerdy teens trade senator cards.

91
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:44,840
- [Caitlin] Oh my god.

92
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:49,200
- Yeah, I got the holographic McClintock.

93
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:52,050
I mean they haven't, they
haven't put out the holographic,

94
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:54,732
like any of the independents, right?

95
00:04:54,732 --> 00:04:56,430
- Okay, but has it been
professionally graded

96
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:57,870
holographic McClintock or-

97
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:59,730
- I'm sorry, do you think
that I would not get

98
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:01,080
it professionally graded?

99
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,988
- I'll give you a McLeary, a McStephens,

100
00:05:03,988 --> 00:05:06,600
and a non-holographic McNarens.

101
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,428
- You have the whole dang Irish set?

102
00:05:09,428 --> 00:05:10,261
(Caitlin and Sam laughing)

103
00:05:10,261 --> 00:05:11,670
I'll give you the holographic McClintock,

104
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:13,560
but there it is absolutely no way

105
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,060
that you're getting my McCain.

106
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,640
- I mean McCain's not worth
that much, but I mean-

107
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,937
- Oh!
- I can give you

108
00:05:18,937 --> 00:05:22,800
some of the Scottish set
if you give me that McCain.

109
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,212
- Well, throw in a McLeary
and then I'll be doing that.

110
00:05:25,212 --> 00:05:26,045
- McLeary?

111
00:05:26,045 --> 00:05:26,878
- 'Cause I know you have that one

112
00:05:26,878 --> 00:05:27,837
but you don't bring it to school.

113
00:05:27,837 --> 00:05:31,440
- (laughing) I'll cut you off there.

114
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,273
Jake and Vic.

115
00:05:32,273 --> 00:05:33,106
- (sighs) Yeah.

116
00:05:33,106 --> 00:05:35,557
- A dialect coach and
the star of the movie,

117
00:05:35,557 --> 00:05:37,890
"Bad British Accent."

118
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:39,210
- We're gonna hit some cues, okay,

119
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:40,620
and you're just gonna
repeat after me, all right?

120
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:42,210
- Great. I'm really excited
to be working with you.

121
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:43,140
- Congratulations on the role,

122
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:43,973
it's huge, it's huge.
- Hey, thank you!

123
00:05:43,973 --> 00:05:45,030
It's my first big one.

124
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:45,863
- All right, you ready?

125
00:05:45,863 --> 00:05:46,696
- Yes.

126
00:05:46,696 --> 00:05:48,120
- It's simply too much.

127
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,310
- Okay, can, sorry, can you
give me that one more time?

128
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:51,751
- It's simply too much.

129
00:05:51,751 --> 00:05:54,480
- [Both] It's simply too much.

130
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,530
- I'm feeling Italian.

131
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:58,316
- Okay, you want to, it's
all in the soft palette

132
00:05:58,316 --> 00:05:59,820
and then the air's going out

133
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:00,653
of the nasal.
- Out of there.

134
00:06:00,653 --> 00:06:02,008
- [Both] Simply too much.

135
00:06:02,008 --> 00:06:02,987
- You don't have to say it the same time

136
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:03,820
as me.
- Oh, sorry.

137
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:05,443
- You can just like, it's
sort of like, you hear it

138
00:06:05,443 --> 00:06:06,276
and then you try it.
- Sure, I'm nervous!

139
00:06:06,276 --> 00:06:07,730
- It's fine, you're doing great!
- You're very talented.

140
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:08,563
- You got the part.

141
00:06:08,563 --> 00:06:10,353
- I know, I know, okay, okay, yeah.

142
00:06:10,353 --> 00:06:12,337
- I won't be having this much any longer.

143
00:06:12,337 --> 00:06:13,800
- I won't be having this much any longer.

144
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,260
- Okay, you see how you,
you're trying to throw it,

145
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:17,850
but don't throw it, swallow it.

146
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:18,870
- Say that one more time?

147
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:19,980
- Well which one's my mother?

148
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:22,170
- Which one's my mother?

149
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:23,310
That felt a little better.

150
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:24,143
Am I still throwing it?

151
00:06:24,143 --> 00:06:25,643
`- You're throwing it, you're throwing it.

152
00:06:25,643 --> 00:06:26,476
I'm supposed to also
- I'm trying to think

153
00:06:26,476 --> 00:06:27,309
about soft pallette.
- be positive as a coach.

154
00:06:27,309 --> 00:06:30,180
Uh-huh, that's a tongue
thing, it's not a jaw thing.

155
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:32,045
- Simply, okay, okay!
(Jacob exclaims)

156
00:06:32,045 --> 00:06:33,924
- She's got it, she's got it.
- Do it again, do it again.

157
00:06:33,924 --> 00:06:34,758
- It's simply too much.

158
00:06:34,758 --> 00:06:35,591
- It's simply too much.

159
00:06:35,591 --> 00:06:36,810
- Yes, good, good, good.
- Oh okay, yeah!

160
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:39,270
- You kinda wanna imagine
like you're a wind sock

161
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:40,470
that's going to get blown away.

162
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:42,540
- Well my character works on a wind farm.

163
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:43,716
- Mm, what is the movie again?

164
00:06:43,716 --> 00:06:45,750
- (laughing) And I'll cut you off there.

165
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,190
The most remarkable thing about that scene

166
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:50,800
was you did get better
doing what he was doing.

167
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,500
(all laughing)

168
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,720
Third, copy cats.

169
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,950
Because since the shoot, I
found the same joke elsewhere.

170
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:03,950
Look we all feed from the
same comedy trough of ideas

171
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,540
and there's no shame in doing something

172
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:08,430
that's been done before.

173
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:11,400
There's only shame in
allowing it into the edit.

174
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,100
Here's Josh doing a Make No Noise bit

175
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:18,540
I later found Fred Armisen
doing exactly on Conan,

176
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:20,850
Lisa and Mary doing a
prompt I later realized

177
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:24,930
was an old CollegeHumor
sketch that I had greenlit,

178
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:27,660
Ross and Anna doing
something I later realized

179
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:29,850
was too similar to another
Make Some Noise bit

180
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:33,630
from the same season, and,
finally, Brennan and Zac

181
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:37,680
doing a prompt I finally
felt was too reminiscent

182
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,050
of one of their greatest hits.

183
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:41,029
Enjoy.

184
00:07:41,029 --> 00:07:43,740
(upbeat xylophone riff)

185
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:46,950
For this, we are going to mix things up.

186
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:50,010
This is Make No Noise.

187
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:51,120
Joshua!
(Josh grunts)

188
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,460
- Fast-motion footage of an animal carcass

189
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:54,813
being eaten by bugs.

190
00:08:09,181 --> 00:08:11,931
Oh god! (laughing)

191
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,960
Josh, that's gonna haunt me.

192
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,303
That's gonna haunt my nightmares.

193
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,650
Lisa and Mary, two flight attendants

194
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:27,650
prepare their passengers
for any scenario possible.

195
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,750
- Hi guys, welcome on
board American Airlines.

196
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,910
It's so nice to have you with us today.

197
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:34,080
- Please take your seat
and if you're going

198
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,430
through a breakup or anything like that,

199
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:37,320
you can ask us for Kleenex at any time.

200
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,730
We'll also talk you through what it's like

201
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:40,110
if a boyfriend cheats
on you with someone else

202
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:42,360
that you know that's
a really close friend.

203
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,040
- If you pee your pants,
don't worry about it.

204
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,660
We'll actually come around,
we've got a couple diapers

205
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:47,190
in the back, we'll give you a little wipe,

206
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:48,120
and we'll clean you right up.

207
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,890
- That's right, and if
you were playing tennis

208
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:52,080
at any point this afternoon
and you hurt your elbow,

209
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,810
your nose, your knees, or your toes,

210
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:55,643
we can come on by.

211
00:08:55,643 --> 00:08:58,320
We have cool packs, ice packs,
and little tensor bandages.

212
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,470
- Yeah, if you have an
elephant in the cargo below,

213
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:03,900
just know that we are taking
great care of your elephant.

214
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,430
We're feeding it hay,
we're feeding it peanuts,

215
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:06,984
we're teaching it tricks. (laughing)

216
00:09:06,984 --> 00:09:07,983
- Did you go to the salon
and you got a hair color

217
00:09:07,983 --> 00:09:09,060
that you didn't like?

218
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,492
The blonde came off a little bit bronze-y?

219
00:09:10,492 --> 00:09:12,223
We can come around and tell
you, "Hey girl, it looks good."

220
00:09:12,223 --> 00:09:14,760
- And if you decide you
kinda wanna go skydiving,

221
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,740
that's cool with us, that's
absolutely fine with us.

222
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:18,268
We just hope that you, you know,

223
00:09:18,268 --> 00:09:20,460
use the safety protocols that we've asked

224
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:21,840
and you can just kind of pop open one

225
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,990
of the doors and just pop on out.

226
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:25,106
- That's right, and if
you have your period,

227
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:25,939
we don't have tampons.

228
00:09:25,939 --> 00:09:27,643
- Yeah, thank you.
- Thank you.

229
00:09:27,643 --> 00:09:30,120
- Anna and Ross.

230
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:34,320
Announcing Thanksgiving Day Parade floats,

231
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,286
but the mushrooms are kicking in.

232
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:39,480
- Another beautiful year here

233
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,700
at the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade.

234
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:42,873
- That's right, Diane.

235
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:44,670
Just when I think they
can't top themselves,

236
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:46,110
they go and do it again.

237
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:50,970
And look here, it's Mr. Snoopy the Dog.

238
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:53,670
Snoopy the Dog is decked
out in Christmas gear

239
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:56,913
because he's heralding
in that time of year.

240
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:00,960
- The vibes from Snoopy
(Sam laughing)

241
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,493
are crazy.

242
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:06,870
- Yes, Snoopy is hanging in the air,

243
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:09,413
suspended as though in a liquid.

244
00:10:09,413 --> 00:10:10,620
(all laughing)

245
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:14,820
The air is the same as
some liquids, chemically.

246
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:18,063
- I feel like that Snoopy kinda
looks like my uncle Michael.

247
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:20,940
- You know when Snoopy
fights the Red Baron?

248
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:21,773
- Yes.

249
00:10:21,773 --> 00:10:24,669
- Isn't it messed up that
we make dogs go to war?

250
00:10:24,669 --> 00:10:25,769
(laughing)
- Right?

251
00:10:25,769 --> 00:10:27,600
- Oh my God, it's a turkey.

252
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:32,520
- Hello, big turkey, I'm Anna.

253
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,732
You look like my uncle Michael.

254
00:10:34,732 --> 00:10:37,113
- (laughing) I'll cut you off there.

255
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,410
Zac and Brennan.

256
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:43,860
One half of this couple
put a lot more work

257
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:46,623
into writing their wedding
vows than the other.

258
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:53,013
- You are... more than a partner.

259
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:56,673
You are everything to me.

260
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:02,430
For the rest of my life,
I will spend every day

261
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:07,380
in the earnest attempt to
make my time a testament

262
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:09,780
to how you have completed me.

263
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:13,230
There is nothing I
cherish more in this world

264
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:15,783
than your love and your time.

265
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:20,468
- One time you farted
and it was pretty narsty.

266
00:11:20,468 --> 00:11:23,010
(Josh and Sam laughing)

267
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:26,889
And the fact that we didn't
break up must mean something.

268
00:11:26,889 --> 00:11:29,013
And the fact that we didn't
break up must mean something.

269
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:32,897
I love you?

270
00:11:32,897 --> 00:11:37,353
- (laughing) Oh, I'll cut you off there.
- [Josh] Narsty!

271
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:43,400
Fourth, everyone's favorite
category, bad taste.

272
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:46,350
Now showing you this stuff
rather defeats the point

273
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:49,200
of cutting it out, so here
we'll just skim the surface.

274
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,540
Here's Josh giving us
something I finally felt

275
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:54,300
was a touch crude, Jacob doing the same,

276
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:57,960
and finally a Ross,
Anna, and Jacquis prompt

277
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:01,680
that Jacquis took
completely off the rails,

278
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,232
shown with his permission, of course.

279
00:12:04,232 --> 00:12:06,750
(upbeat xylophone riff)

280
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:11,750
Josh, an adult from
Peanuts having phone sex.

281
00:12:12,728 --> 00:12:16,530
(Josh flirting in gibberish)

282
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:21,151
(Josh getting aroused in gibberish)

283
00:12:21,151 --> 00:12:26,129
(Josh moaning in gibberish)

284
00:12:26,129 --> 00:12:30,496
(Josh moaning and screaming in gibberish)

285
00:12:30,496 --> 00:12:34,745
(Josh orgasming in gibberish)

286
00:12:34,745 --> 00:12:36,200
- (poof) You know what I mean?

287
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,770
- Oh wow, Josh.

288
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:39,630
You know, it's exactly what I asked for

289
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:40,890
and so I don't know why I'm doing this,

290
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:42,541
but negative one point for you.

291
00:12:42,541 --> 00:12:45,040
(Brennan and Zac laughing)

292
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,121
- (in gibberish) What?

293
00:12:46,121 --> 00:12:48,600
- Jake, a nude model can't help

294
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:52,050
but talk to the class about their scars.

295
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:52,883
- Hi, everybody.

296
00:13:00,366 --> 00:13:01,324
(Jacob grunts)

297
00:13:01,324 --> 00:13:04,324
(Sam and Zac laughing)

298
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,220
- Oh, this, this? Yeah, it's a skin graft.

299
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,380
I was in northern Thailand,
bit of a moped incident.

300
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:12,810
I was going to a waterfall,
it got a little slick.

301
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:16,740
Yeah, yeah, yeah, Thai hospitals.

302
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:17,820
That's why it's a different color,

303
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:21,990
you know, they just don't,
it doesn't graft the same.

304
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:23,640
What do you see when you look at it?

305
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:26,070
See Michigan, right?
Kinda looks like Michigan?

306
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:27,920
Looks like a state right there, yeah.

307
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:29,903
Yeah.

308
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:33,354
That's from badminton.

309
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:34,262
(all laughing)

310
00:13:34,262 --> 00:13:37,230
That's a badminton
incident. It was the racket.

311
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:40,235
Myanmar, I was in Myanmar
playing badminton.

312
00:13:40,235 --> 00:13:42,585
(groans) Spent a lot of
time in South East Asia.

313
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,940
That was the wrong- I'm in the wrong room?

314
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:48,300
- (laughing) And I'll cut you off there!

315
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:51,779
Just in front of bunch
of kids learning algebra?

316
00:13:51,779 --> 00:13:52,830
(Jacob laughing)

317
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:55,470
Ross, Jacquis, Anna.

318
00:13:55,470 --> 00:14:00,470
America's Got Talent judges
judging the craziest act

319
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,304
they've ever seen.

320
00:14:03,304 --> 00:14:08,228
- (prolonged groan of
confusion and disgust)

321
00:14:08,228 --> 00:14:10,417
I'm gonna be real with you, dawg.

322
00:14:10,417 --> 00:14:11,580
- Oh man!

323
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:13,500
- That was the worst shit
I ever seen in my life.

324
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,880
- Is your leg okay?

325
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:17,550
I see bone.

326
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:21,240
- It seemed to me at first as
though it was unintentional.

327
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,073
- Yeah.

328
00:14:22,073 --> 00:14:25,126
- And then you just started
manhandling that little bone.

329
00:14:25,126 --> 00:14:26,880
(laughing)
- That was so bad

330
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:31,380
that I might put myself
back in the slave trade

331
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:32,769
and go back to-

332
00:14:32,769 --> 00:14:33,602
- What?

333
00:14:33,602 --> 00:14:34,435
- That's how bad it was, man.

334
00:14:34,435 --> 00:14:36,904
I might put myself as that-
- Is that an option?

335
00:14:36,904 --> 00:14:39,270
- This is so bad that I, you know,

336
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:40,710
I don't wanna be free here no more

337
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:41,940
because this ain't freedom.

338
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:43,140
- I can't believe I'm saying this,

339
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:45,930
but watching what you
did also made me want

340
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:50,024
to amend, amend the Constitution.
(all laughing)

341
00:14:50,024 --> 00:14:53,340
- I didn't, I don't wanna do that.

342
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:55,387
- If Abraham Lincoln would've been like,

343
00:14:55,387 --> 00:14:57,150
"The Emancipation Proclamation"-

344
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:58,410
- Again, I don't support that.

345
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:00,024
- [Ross] I don't, I can't.

346
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:01,890
- [Anna] I can't get behind that.
- It is about to be passed.

347
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:03,040
- I'll cut you off there.

348
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,663
(all laughing)

349
00:15:05,663 --> 00:15:08,460
Jacquis, you can expect an email from me

350
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:11,957
about whether or not you really
wanna put that in this show.

351
00:15:11,957 --> 00:15:13,240
(all laughing)

352
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,060
Ross is like, "Yeah, I'm
gonna join this bit."

353
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:17,068
Anna's like, "I'm not
gonna join this bit."

354
00:15:17,068 --> 00:15:20,190
- I said, "Not for me,
not for me to join."

355
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:23,100
- Finally, evenness.

356
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,800
You see, when I cut a prompt,
I cut two more prompts

357
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:30,240
from that same round in order
so that rounds feel even.

358
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,007
We shoot 25 prompts per
episode of Make Some Noise

359
00:15:33,007 --> 00:15:35,850
We shoot 25 prompts per
episode of Make Some Noise

360
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:40,140
and only 15 to 20 make
it into the episode,

361
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:44,005
which yes, is brutal, but so is showbiz.

362
00:15:44,005 --> 00:15:46,830
(upbeat xylophone riff)

363
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:50,760
Brennan, a Venetian gondolier's song

364
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,580
is clearly angling for a tip.

365
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:56,220
- Huh, this is your first time in Venice?

366
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:59,490
Well, let me welcome you!

00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:04,490

371
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:22,380
My salary is dependent on

372
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:23,862
I do have a family.

which is very affordable.

378
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:41,490
The boat won't move until
I see some indication

379
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:44,610
that I am not busting
my ass for no reason.

380
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:46,257
- Oh my God, give him a tip, Harold.

381
00:16:46,257 --> 00:16:48,216
(Sam laughing)

382
00:16:48,216 --> 00:16:49,770
- Jacquis and Anna.

383
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:54,240
A couple one week from breaking
up goes grocery shopping.

384
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,740
- I was thinking soup tonight.

385
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:57,503
- Whatever.

386
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:01,050
- I said I was thinking soup tonight.

387
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:03,180
- Okay, yeah, we can get Progresso.

388
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:06,415
I was thinking (quietly)
we can see other people.

389
00:17:06,415 --> 00:17:09,840
(Sam and Ross laughing)

390
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:11,460
- What?

391
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:12,517
Did you literally just say,

392
00:17:12,517 --> 00:17:13,980
"I was thinking we see other people"

393
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:16,170
as I was bringing up soup for dinner?

394
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:18,030
- Will you stop screaming
at me in the middle

395
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:18,863
of this Ralph's?
- Gaslighting.

396
00:17:18,863 --> 00:17:21,210
That's gaslighting. You're
gaslighting me in Ralph's?

397
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:23,190
- No, stop, lower your voice.

398
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:24,930
- I'm getting soup materials

399
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:26,863
and you don't have to have any of it.

400
00:17:26,863 --> 00:17:29,250
- I won't, I love your
soup, I love your soup.

401
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:31,053
- You just like my pussy.
- I just don't

402
00:17:31,053 --> 00:17:32,470
love you anymore.

403
00:17:33,703 --> 00:17:35,910
Yes, I do like your pussy.

404
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:37,320
- I'll cut this off here.

405
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,080
I think there were three
people in that scene.

406
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,880
There was Jacquis, Anna, and Anna's finger

407
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:45,423
and they were all, they
all had equal air time.

408
00:17:46,394 --> 00:17:48,000
Caitlin.
- Hi.

409
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,390
A YouTuber doing a CTA, but you can tell

410
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:55,173
she's barely keeping it
together emotionally.

411
00:17:56,490 --> 00:17:59,065
- Um, thank you for watching my

412
00:17:59,065 --> 00:18:01,514
(sorrowful) bouclé sofa DIY tutorial.

413
00:18:01,514 --> 00:18:06,300
If you want to, please
smash that subscribe button

414
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:11,300
and like the video and next week I will

415
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,370
be doing a video on how to grow,

416
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:17,220
regrow, your house plants back thank you.

417
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:20,040
- If more YouTubers used the
pity vote, I would subscribe

418
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,870
to way more things.
- Yeah, absolutely.

419
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:23,070
- Brennan.
- Mhm.

420
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:25,560
A pilot pointing out landmarks,

421
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:28,140
but it's a little
worrying how he's going on

422
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:31,289
about our relative insignificance.

423
00:18:31,289 --> 00:18:33,030
- All right, passengers, we've turned off

424
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:34,620
the fasten seatbelt sign as we've reached

425
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:38,250
our cruising altitude of 35.000 feet.

426
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:41,520
Go ahead and take a look out
the left side of the aircraft,

427
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,820
you'll see the beautiful Grand Canyon,

428
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:47,133
one of nature's most wonderful monuments.

429
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:51,540
Monument, intended to stand for something,

430
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:56,463
a living memory, and sort of
wonder, who will remember us?

431
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,460
Who will remember us?

432
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:02,527
Old Chuck Dabbins

433
00:19:04,709 --> 00:19:06,609
flew for Spirit Airlines

434
00:19:06,609 --> 00:19:10,422
'cause he got drummed outta
Delta for hitting a kid.

435
00:19:10,422 --> 00:19:11,255
(laughing)
- [Brennan] All right...

436
00:19:11,255 --> 00:19:13,473
I'll cut you off there, Brennan.

437
00:19:14,973 --> 00:19:18,330
- What trees are saying to each other

438
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:20,583
through their root systems.

439
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:24,857
- I think I have every kind of pee on me.

440
00:19:24,857 --> 00:19:26,130
(laughing)

441
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:28,830
- I know this is paranoid. I
know it's probably not true.

442
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:29,760
- Okay.

443
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,160
- I think there's an animal in me.

444
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:32,993
- What?

445
00:19:32,993 --> 00:19:34,642
- You say that every time.

446
00:19:34,642 --> 00:19:35,580
- No, no, no, no, no,
listen, listen, listen,

447
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:36,413
for real, for real, for real.

448
00:19:36,413 --> 00:19:38,112
- Greg, you say it every time-

449
00:19:38,112 --> 00:19:41,190
- There's an animal in me now, right now.

450
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:42,570
It could be a squirrel,
it could be a bird.

451
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:44,310
I don't know 'cause I don't have eyes!

452
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:46,140
- Listen, as someone who has a family

453
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:48,840
of owls nestled deep inside,

454
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:51,990
I am comforted by the fact
that I am someone's home.

455
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:53,790
Greg, you're being too paranoid,

456
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:56,504
just commit to being someone's home, okay?

457
00:19:56,504 --> 00:19:58,110
- (gasps) Oh God, what was that?

458
00:19:58,110 --> 00:19:59,550
Oh my God, that was a frost.

459
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:00,527
That was frost, winter's here again!

460
00:20:00,527 --> 00:20:01,360
- No!
- Oh no!

461
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,030
- Oh my God, everyone,
fucking drop your leaves,

462
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:04,102
drop all your leaves!

463
00:20:04,102 --> 00:20:06,570
(all groan)

464
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:08,036
- Oh, God.

465
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:10,080
- I actually, sorry guys, that,

466
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,550
I think that may have
been an ice cream truck.

467
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:14,733
- Well fuck me.
- And I'll cut you off there.

468
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:18,480
Ross and Jacquis.

469
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,560
A post-game interview with
the player who came on,

470
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:25,162
threw up, passed out,
and was carried away.

471
00:20:25,162 --> 00:20:26,640
(Anna and Ross laughing)

472
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,730
- We're here with Ross James,

473
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:31,350
distant cousin to LeBron James,

474
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:34,080
who played his first NBA game today.

475
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:37,792
Why won't you tell us uh...
what the fuck happened?

476
00:20:37,792 --> 00:20:40,800
- Yeah, not a good day for me.
(laughing)

477
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,540
Showed a lot of hustle, a lot of heart,

478
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:45,300
but gotta be honest, this
is purely a nepotism thing.

479
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:47,370
I am here because of my family.

480
00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:50,010
Really thought that, you
know, grit and determination

481
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:51,240
could carry me through.

482
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,500
Turns out, you need talent.

483
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:57,319
And I hit the court,
immediately became lightheaded,

484
00:20:57,319 --> 00:20:59,400
pretty intimidating.
(laughing)

485
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:02,850
Barfed in my mouth a little
bit and then the barf

486
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:04,710
continued to flow from there.

487
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:07,380
- Now, despite all of that,
you guys still had a chance

488
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:11,670
to win the game at the buzzer
and LeBron passed you the ball

489
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:15,120
and you were right under
the rim, nobody around you.

490
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:15,953
What happened?

491
00:21:15,953 --> 00:21:17,287
- At that time, I was
waving and screaming,

492
00:21:17,287 --> 00:21:21,210
"Please no, don't. Please, I beg you."

493
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:24,063
He was deaf to my pleas
and passed me the ball.

494
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:29,730
I caught it by the grace of
God and proceeded to dunk it

495
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:32,820
into a nearby Gatorade bucket.
(laughing)

496
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:35,310
Slipped on the Gatorade, got a concussion,

497
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:37,961
don't know whether or not this is a dream.

498
00:21:37,961 --> 00:21:40,290
(Sam and Anna laughing )
- I will cut you off there,

499
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:41,336
you two.

500
00:21:41,336 --> 00:21:44,280
That does it for us
here at Make Some Noise,

501
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,690
but worry not!

502
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:48,570
More Game Changer is
just around the corner.

503
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:51,870
And after that, more Make Some Noise

504
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:56,370
in a never ending cycle that
I like to call my life now.

505
00:21:56,370 --> 00:22:01,020
It is a privileged life, a
life spent watching my friends

506
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:03,783
be funny, and it's all thanks to you.

507
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:09,903
It is, as ever, an honor to
be your host in residence.

508
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:13,222
Thank you for watching.

509
00:22:13,222 --> 00:22:16,139
(jazzy music ends)
