1
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,438
Me and my little brother here...

2
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,592
...we're going to New York now.
We're going to make an orchestra.

3
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,279
Biggest songwriter in Cuba
sitting right there, Nestor Castillo.

4
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,830
<i>We're going to call it
"Kings of the Mambo" ...</i>

5
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,752
...something like that.

6
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:18,550
You know, we could use a pretty girl
like you to pose for the album cover.

7
00:04:18,721 --> 00:04:20,712
If you'd be interested.

8
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,993
We're gonna set
New York on fire, baby.

9
00:04:45,081 --> 00:04:47,231
That's for you, lady.

10
00:04:47,721 --> 00:04:49,313
Thanks.

11
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:01,077
- So are you famous?
- All over Cuba.

12
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,798
Hey, brother, listen to this.

13
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,396
"The D.D. v anderbilt
Practical Secret of Success."

14
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,118
- Success.
- Success.

15
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,872
- Success.
- Success.

16
00:05:10,039 --> 00:05:11,757
The hell with it.

17
00:05:11,921 --> 00:05:13,673
<i>"Whether you're rich or poor...</i>

18
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,035
...Chinaman, Indian
or from the planet Mars...

19
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,792
<i>...this book can change your life."</i>

20
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,234
Something tells me...

21
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,233
<i>...I'm gonna be sorry
I ever got him that book.</i>

22
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,553
His English ain't so good.

23
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,676
I think Cuban accents are sexy.

24
00:05:26,841 --> 00:05:28,399
You think so?

25
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,550
Let's go! Come on!

26
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,316
Forget Maria, kid!

27
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,516
Because the best-Iooking girls
in New York...

28
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,511
...are waiting for you right now!

29
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,955
Move over, come on!

30
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,394
Get your paper here!

31
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,950
Schweitzer wins Nobel Peace Prize!

32
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:31,989
Pablo?

33
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,914
Cesar!

34
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,470
Give me a big hug!

35
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,637
Put him down.

36
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:58,269
Sure, New York
is just waiting for you!

37
00:06:58,439 --> 00:07:01,192
I've been waiting for you, baby!

38
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,789
Blanca, look at that.

39
00:07:13,961 --> 00:07:15,713
Mama embroidered that.

40
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,839
Come on, get the hell out of here.

41
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,989
Come on, eh?

42
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,720
- What happened?
- Nothing. I cut myself shaving.

43
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:35,759
- You were lucky you were not killed.
- Will you stop? Please?

44
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:38,549
Hey, Cesar, what happened?

45
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,073
The man who owned the club
where we played...

46
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,151
...wanted to own us too.

47
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,833
They got into a fight.

48
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,275
And that's why we came.

49
00:07:48,439 --> 00:07:50,350
- To make a new career.
- Make a new career.

50
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:53,318
Nobody owns
Cesar and Nestor Castillo.

51
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,755
You write the music,
I worry about the business...

52
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,832
<i>...and we're all gonna get rich,
happy and famous in America.</i>

53
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,316
Would you get out of here
with this stupid thing? Stupid kid.

54
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,948
- Where should we make our debut?
- Now, wait a minute...

55
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,315
Come on,
what's the most classy joint in town?

56
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,754
We just got here.

57
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:17,435
The shrimp that sleeps gets carried
away by a cocktail. Let's not be stupid.

58
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,874
You haven't changed.

59
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,838
Just off the boat, and you think
you'll land a gig downtown.

60
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,036
Ten thousand Latin guys in Jersey...

61
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:27,670
...playing rent parties,
and he's gonna play the Palladium?

62
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,229
Is that where a gentleman like
Desi Arnaz would play?

63
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:32,435
The one and only!
Blanca and me were there...

64
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:35,318
...dance a little bit every weekend.
- That's it. That's it.

65
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:38,119
- Let's go!
- What?

66
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,108
Please, you think I came to New York
to sit with my feet in hot water?

67
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,840
We're going to the Palladium.
Get up. Come on.

68
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,230
Nando, let's go!

69
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,438
Oh, how beautiful!

70
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,558
Hi, Russ. I love these... Oh.

71
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,838
Who's the big millionaire over here?

72
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,911
Fernando Perez and his wife, Ismelda.

73
00:09:48,079 --> 00:09:49,558
Biggest manager in the business.

74
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,348
<i>He can take you to the top
of el mundo mambo...</i>

75
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,670
...but he'll own your soul.

76
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,751
That's Carlo Ricci next to him.

77
00:09:56,921 --> 00:09:59,515
He owns half the clubs in town.

78
00:10:06,881 --> 00:10:08,633
I love it.

79
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,593
Who is that?

80
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,955
Miguel Montoya,
best arranger in the city.

81
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:21,112
With him, is his mother, Evalina.
She owns Club Babalu in Harlem.

82
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,919
- Babalu.
- I heard they got shot at once.

83
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,992
But their Yoruba spirits
turned their bullets back.

84
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,553
Santeros.

85
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:32,799
- Who's the kid next to her?
- Their godson, Frankie Suarez.

86
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,353
Hello.

87
00:10:37,361 --> 00:10:39,750
Two of everything
in this country, huh?

88
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,239
My kind of place.

89
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:44,153
Come on, there's one for you
and one for me. Come on!

90
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,750
Creep!

91
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,672
Hey! Get away from her!

92
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:01,318
I got this. I got this covered.
Please. Thank you.

93
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,471
I got it! I got it.

94
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,915
I got this covered. Now, please.

95
00:11:14,961 --> 00:11:18,033
You know, you are a knockout, baby.

96
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,791
I'm just gonna sit here
and buy everything you got to sell.

97
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:28,629
Thanks, hon, but I think they'll wreck
that nice baritone voice of yours.

98
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,593
Oh, my God.

99
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:41,791
Oh, my God!

100
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:46,876
If she cooks like she walks,
brother, I am gonna lick her plate!

101
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,398
Stay away from her!

102
00:12:07,961 --> 00:12:09,838
Hey, Tito!

103
00:12:10,001 --> 00:12:11,719
Tito! Remember me?

104
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,154
Let me play!

105
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,117
- Tito!
- Come on, come on.

106
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,955
- Thank you.
- Go ahead, come on, come on.

107
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,437
- Yeah, yeah!
- Thank you.

108
00:12:31,879 --> 00:12:33,312
Look at that!

109
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,832
He's my brother! He's my brother!

110
00:12:46,999 --> 00:12:49,593
- My cousin.
- His cousin! He's my brother!

111
00:13:56,641 --> 00:13:58,074
Where did everybody go?

112
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,954
Come on, guys, inside!
Let's go. Come on!

113
00:14:05,359 --> 00:14:07,315
It was his fate.

114
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:10,438
- Son of a bitch had it coming.
- Son of a bitch ruined my number.

115
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,955
Maybe our chances of a job here
with Tito Puente.

116
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,509
- That's a shame.
- T's going on tour tomorrow, anyway.

117
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,432
Go down to the union and join up.

118
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,192
Everybody can join the union, man.

119
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,352
You need a tunesmith to play
more than a rent party in this town.

120
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,794
I'm Frankie Suarez.

121
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,871
<i>- You play an instrument?
- Los bongos.</i>

122
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,600
If you play like you dance,
let's get together.

123
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:31,752
Remember, tomorrow is work.
We gotta be up with the birdies.

124
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,797
You didn't get much sleep on the bus.

125
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:36,154
There's enough time to sleep
when I'm dead.

126
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,912
- Good night.
- Cesar Castillo.

127
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,674
I am so enchanted to have met you,
I can't tell you.

128
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,114
Lanna Lake.

129
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,998
Honey, you're the cat's meow
on-stage!

130
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,390
I know that. Thank you.

131
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,313
You know, my brother and I
are making our own orchestra.

132
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:52,552
We could use a pretty girl like you
to pose for the album cover.

133
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,996
Modeling is my chosen profession,
honey.

134
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:03,435
Anyway, all this modeling ever got me
was a Miss Teenage America Pageant...

135
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,672
<i>...and a spread in Seventeen magazine.</i>

136
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,592
A spread, huh?

137
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,997
<i>In Seventeen magazine.</i>

138
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:15,073
- I was tickled pink.
- Pink.

139
00:15:15,239 --> 00:15:18,629
Then I left Sandusky
and I moved right to New York.

140
00:15:18,841 --> 00:15:20,399
But, honey...

141
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,154
...what the judges liked,
the magazine didn't.

142
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,993
I was just a little too broad
in the beam.

143
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,958
Lucky for us, I'm not a magazine.

144
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,792
I played a few choruses,
but I never made the Rockettes.

145
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:39,475
I couldn't take all the creeps
making passes at me in the clubs.

146
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:42,757
So when I landed this job
with the bouncers to protect me...

147
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:45,434
...I thanked my lucky stars.

148
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,558
In Cuba, a girl like you
would need an army to protect you.

149
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,109
You shouldn't complain so much.

150
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,918
I bet you say that to all the girls.

151
00:15:53,079 --> 00:15:54,831
You're my first American beauty.

152
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,638
Really?

153
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,439
And I'm the Statue of Liberty.

154
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:14,159
You know, you're so beautiful, Lanna.

155
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,914
You're not so bad yourself.

156
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:35,114
Statue of Liberty, huh?

157
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:58,230
That's beautiful. Say that again.

158
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,994
<i>Te quiero, baby.</i>

159
00:17:04,841 --> 00:17:08,151
<i>And I "te quiero" you too, baby.</i>

160
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:16,992
I love this country.

161
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,670
<i>I thought you believed in me.</i>

162
00:17:42,839 --> 00:17:44,477
<i>In our love.</i>

163
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,396
<i>I was wrong.</i>

164
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,673
<i>Since you married Luis...</i>

165
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:53,149
<i>... there is nothing left for me in Cuba.</i>

166
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:56,915
<i>And so I've gone to America
with Cesar.</i>

167
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,559
<i>A new country.</i>

168
00:17:58,721 --> 00:17:59,995
<i>New life.</i>

169
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,071
<i>Without you.</i>

170
00:18:02,241 --> 00:18:04,038
<i>But someday you'll hear my song:</i>

171
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,875
<i>"Beautiful Maria of My Soul."</i>

172
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:10,634
<i>And then, you will know
that you are my destiny...</i>

173
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,995
<i>... as I am yours.</i>

174
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,916
Don't worry. It's gonna happen
for us here, kid.

175
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,431
I can feel it.

176
00:19:05,601 --> 00:19:09,913
In the name of the Mambo
and the Rumba and the Cha-cha-cha.

177
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,270
Would you get to work?

178
00:19:42,479 --> 00:19:43,753
You crazy?

179
00:19:43,921 --> 00:19:46,481
<i>Aren't you the músico loco
that got up at the Palladium?</i>

180
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,437
This is the guy.

181
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,955
Tell me, how do you cross
your sticks like that?

182
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:55,269
That was some show
you put on last night, man.

183
00:19:55,439 --> 00:19:57,589
- You saw my solo?
- Solo?

184
00:19:57,761 --> 00:19:59,991
You almost did that solo
on your ass!

185
00:20:00,161 --> 00:20:02,470
- But Tito liked you.
- They were at the Palladium.

186
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,315
Anyway, I'm Pito. This is Willie.

187
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,153
Are you fellas musicians?

188
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,753
Who isn't?

189
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:12,114
- Let's show them how we warm up.
- Watch, man.

190
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,275
<i>I play timbales, he plays the bass.</i>

191
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:22,556
This is not the Palladium, guys.

192
00:20:22,719 --> 00:20:24,311
Oh, sorry, man.

193
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,596
Did you have a band in Cuba?

194
00:20:26,761 --> 00:20:28,797
Yeah. The Havana Melody Boys.

195
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,916
We used to slaughter
more than a cow.

196
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:34,311
With a first-class arranger...

197
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,152
...someone who knows the ropes...

198
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:37,718
...we'll set New York on fire.

199
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,791
Where you gonna find an arranger
like that?

200
00:20:39,961 --> 00:20:40,950
<i>I'm telling you...</i>

201
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,879
How you gonna pay him?
With steaks and hamburgers?

202
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,917
Just leave it to me.

203
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,437
You have very good taste.

204
00:20:50,599 --> 00:20:54,308
Lecuona is the finest composer
alive today.

205
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,471
Thank you, Cesar...

206
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,119
...Nestor, for your generosity.

207
00:21:01,199 --> 00:21:04,271
So Frankie tells me that you
and your brother are very talented.

208
00:21:05,641 --> 00:21:08,280
That you've written songs
with a new sound.

209
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,795
We got so many now,
they fill a suitcase.

210
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,793
And you have just come from Havana
where you played in clubs?

211
00:21:13,959 --> 00:21:17,031
Our last job was at the Tropicana
in Havana.

212
00:21:17,199 --> 00:21:20,032
We played all the clubs in Cuba.

213
00:21:20,201 --> 00:21:21,759
All the clubs.

214
00:21:21,921 --> 00:21:25,072
You want to know if I would be
interested in arranging these songs?

215
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,796
Yes.

216
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,033
One...

217
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,679
...the son of Changó.

218
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,193
The other...

219
00:21:45,241 --> 00:21:48,472
...the son of Yemayá,
goddess of the sea.

220
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:51,674
Fire and water.

221
00:21:52,239 --> 00:21:53,877
Yes.

222
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,871
I must hear them play.

223
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:58,554
Let's go downstairs to my club.

224
00:21:58,721 --> 00:22:01,952
- You play for us there, okay?
- Of course.

225
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,991
Friday night, Empire Ballroom.

226
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,559
Happiness, the American way.

227
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,994
Come to the Empire.

228
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:56,993
"The deepest urge
in human nature...

229
00:23:57,159 --> 00:24:01,072
...is the desire to be important,
to be great.

230
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,834
The rare individual
who satisfies this hunger...

231
00:24:04,001 --> 00:24:06,071
...will hold people
in the palm of his hand...

232
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:10,153
...so even the undertaker
will regret his death."

233
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:12,230
The undertaker can regret our death...

234
00:24:12,401 --> 00:24:14,915
<i>...but it'd be nice
if he came to see the show first.</i>

235
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:17,389
Here, give these pretty fliers
to the people.

236
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,869
I show you my deepest urge.
Come Friday night.

237
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:23,953
- Mambo Kings!
- Mambo, Mambo King. Mambo, please.

238
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:26,714
You come see me,
I'll come see you, okay? Please.

239
00:24:42,721 --> 00:24:45,872
Come on, Nestor, come on, Nestor!

240
00:24:49,879 --> 00:24:51,710
You are a musician?

241
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:58,470
Yes, I am a musician.

242
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,796
I can tell you're a good musician.

243
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,273
How?

244
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,794
I mean, thank you.

245
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:17,274
My name is Nestor Castillo.

246
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,476
- Delores.
- Delores.

247
00:25:19,641 --> 00:25:22,280
Delores Fuentes.

248
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,109
The song you were whistling before?

249
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,471
A bolero.

250
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,598
I have written
12 different versions of it.

251
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,949
It has a name?

252
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,874
"Beautiful Maria of my Soul."

253
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:50,511
Something like that.

254
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,958
This Maria...

255
00:25:55,640 --> 00:26:00,111
...inspired 12 different versions
of your song?

256
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,397
It's just a name.

257
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:10,277
Maybe I'll write it
using your name instead.

258
00:26:15,121 --> 00:26:18,670
I clean house for a rich man on 61 st.

259
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,033
He's so rich, he's unhappy.

260
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:26,877
But he always says
I can help myself to any of his books.

261
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,314
So for lunch...

262
00:26:28,481 --> 00:26:30,790
...I make roast-beef sandwiches
and read.

263
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,636
What will you do with all that reading?

264
00:26:36,119 --> 00:26:38,075
I'm studying to be a schoolteacher.

265
00:26:39,239 --> 00:26:42,549
I got to school twice a week.
At night.

266
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,994
You're ambitious, huh?

267
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,872
Yes.

268
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,195
I want to make something of myself.

269
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,318
Is your family here?

270
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,271
Yes, my sister.

271
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,990
My father died last year.

272
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:05,152
I'm sorry. I'm very sorry.

273
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,791
And the song at the bus stop?

274
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,599
"Beautiful Maria of My Soul."

275
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,436
We were going to be married.

276
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,314
What happened?

277
00:27:29,599 --> 00:27:32,796
She married the owner of the club
where my brother and I played.

278
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:39,358
- I'm sorry.
- That's okay.

279
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,991
You know, Delores...

280
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:53,030
<i>...I'm going to have
my own little club someday.</i>

281
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,394
You see? You are ambitious too.

282
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,479
A little bit.

283
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:08,715
Why don't you come dancing with me?
Friday.

284
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,877
You can see us play.

285
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,192
How are you?

286
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,078
I love you.

287
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:02,156
Yeah! Come on!

288
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:30,554
Which one is he?

289
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:42,759
The one in the middle, dancing?

290
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,198
The one with the trumpet.

291
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,517
That Castillo, he looks like trouble.

292
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:58,990
Yes, I know, but I think he is worth it.

293
00:30:41,601 --> 00:30:43,831
Mambo Kings, ladies and gentlemen!

294
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,310
Come on, let's hear it for them!
Mambo Kings!

295
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,390
And now, ladies and gentlemen...

296
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:52,356
...let's get ready for Machito...

297
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:56,071
- Thank you, thank you.
...and his Afro-Cubans!

298
00:31:05,719 --> 00:31:08,677
Mambo Kings! Don't forget that!

299
00:31:17,199 --> 00:31:18,871
So we're a bunch of farm boys, huh?

300
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:22,477
Drinks for everyone
on the Castillo brothers!

301
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:48,229
- Hey, how are you?
- Fine.

302
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,709
This is the girl I told you about,
Delores Fuentes.

303
00:31:50,881 --> 00:31:52,678
- My brother Cesar.
- Pleased to meet you.

304
00:31:52,841 --> 00:31:56,151
I'm Anna Maria, Delores' sister.
You fellows were great!

305
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,515
Lanna Lake, honey. Nice to meet you.

306
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,352
I think I'll go powder my nose.

307
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:04,034
- I'll be back in a minute, okay?
- Okay. I'll wait here.

308
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:26,436
He thinks he's the last Coca-Cola
in the desert.

309
00:33:26,961 --> 00:33:28,917
He is, honey.

310
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:58,469
Johnny, signing with me
was just the beginning.

311
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,835
From here, anything you want.

312
00:34:00,999 --> 00:34:05,072
El Morocco, the Palladium.
Your future is gold.

313
00:34:05,241 --> 00:34:07,516
Thank you, Fernando.
I'm very grateful.

314
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,830
It's my pleasure.

315
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:47,279
Ladies and gents,
it's my pleasure to introduce...

316
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:54,039
<i>...direct from Puerto Rico,
El Suavecito, Johnny Casanova.</i>

317
00:35:18,439 --> 00:35:20,157
This is for you.

318
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,436
It's beautiful.

319
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,671
You like?

320
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,597
Let me do it.

321
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:36,949
I'm really happy you're here, Delorita.

322
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:39,076
Thank you for coming.

323
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,471
They've been on top
for about 40 weeks now.

324
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:37,234
We play circles around them.

325
00:36:37,399 --> 00:36:40,914
Montoya says if we top the Diamonds,
we'll play any club.

326
00:36:41,079 --> 00:36:44,833
A month from now, they'll be opening
for you, and you'd go on another day.

327
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:51,309
Very, very impressive, Señor Castillo.

328
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,590
I knew it when I saw you
at the Palladium...

329
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:57,116
...that you were very talented.
You feel the music...

330
00:36:57,281 --> 00:37:00,114
...and that nobody can teach you
or take away.

331
00:37:00,281 --> 00:37:01,953
Congratulations.

332
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:06,394
It's a lucky coincidence
to run into each other.

333
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:11,475
But I always say, God puts his children
exactly where they should be.

334
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,955
That's funny, I always said that too.

335
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:20,519
Have a Havana with me, Cesar.

336
00:37:20,679 --> 00:37:25,036
And let's see how Fernando Perez
can take the Mambo Kings to the top.

337
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:33,239
Who the hell are you, anyway?
The Mambo pope?

338
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:36,437
Guy thinks I came to America
to trade one thief for another.

339
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:40,036
- Cesar.
- I think you don't know who I am, señor.

340
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,838
Whoever you are, I know in Havana...

341
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,151
<i>... los Mafioso with balls of steel
could not own Cesar Castillo.</i>

342
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,550
So don't you try.

343
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:50,640
You have much to learn, Mambo King.

344
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,711
Pray God you learn it...

345
00:37:52,881 --> 00:37:54,997
...before the banana boat
sails back to Cuba.

346
00:37:57,320 --> 00:38:00,915
- What are you, the captain?
- Cesar, are you crazy?

347
00:38:02,479 --> 00:38:05,277
I'm crazy, and your brain's so soft,
already you forgot Luis.

348
00:38:05,441 --> 00:38:08,239
It's lucky I have that
as a reminder for the rest of my life.

349
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:11,392
<i>Let's get out of here before these
pendejos give me a stroke.</i>

350
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:12,754
Here. Pay with that.

351
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:16,230
Leave the business to me
and stick to your music, kid.

352
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,675
"It was a fabulous night
at the Empire Ballroom...

353
00:38:18,841 --> 00:38:20,433
...as a new band came on the scene.

354
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,397
The Latin rhythms filled the air as...

355
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,596
...under the hip-swinging,
pelvis-grinding...

356
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:27,069
...admiralship of their singer,
Cesar Castillo...

357
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:30,710
...the fabulous Mambo Kings
made a fabulous debut."

358
00:38:30,881 --> 00:38:35,716
As Mr. v anderbilt says, "He who can,
has the whole world with him.

359
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:39,839
He who cannot,
walks the world alone."

360
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,753
Miss Enchantment, if you wanna come
with a Mambo King...

361
00:38:42,919 --> 00:38:47,197
<i>- ...I'll show you a little piece of Havana.
- Yeah, a very little piece.</i>

362
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,951
Bigger than your piece.

363
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:52,993
Mr. Ricci.

364
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:56,072
Did you see this "fabulous night at
the Empire Ballroom" debut?

365
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:59,232
I know. Everybody love you guys.
But it's such a shame.

366
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:02,278
- What's the shame?
- My girl Luisa, she no call you?

367
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,839
I got no call. Who got a call?

368
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,309
Señor Castillo, my club,
it is booked for months.

369
00:39:06,479 --> 00:39:08,709
Maybe there is one place for you,
I put you in.

370
00:39:08,879 --> 00:39:10,710
Sorry, I make a mistake
with the booking.

371
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:13,314
- You made a mistake?
- I'm sorry, I got partners.

372
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:16,392
- I can't do anything about it.
- Come here.

373
00:39:16,841 --> 00:39:19,230
- Hey, Cesar.
- We had a deal!

374
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,231
- Hey, we had a deal!
- The club is booked.

375
00:39:21,399 --> 00:39:22,752
Hey, don't touch my brother!

376
00:39:22,919 --> 00:39:25,194
Hey, don't push him! Don't push him.

377
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,634
That's it, it's finished.

378
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:30,395
I knew it. I knew it. I told you so!

379
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:29,514
Come on, will you?

380
00:41:29,681 --> 00:41:32,559
Let's show them in Havana
what a couple of stars look like.

381
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:36,190
Smile, will you? We're in America.

382
00:41:37,519 --> 00:41:39,669
No, no, I don't hear you.
I don't hear you.

383
00:41:39,841 --> 00:41:41,513
Talk American to me, please.

384
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,796
It's not my language, American,
not my country.

385
00:41:43,961 --> 00:41:46,191
Well, it's the only country
we got right now.

386
00:41:46,359 --> 00:41:48,350
Now, come on, smile.

387
00:41:48,519 --> 00:41:51,113
Smile. You want me
to waste another 25 cents?

388
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:53,832
Come on, smile. Smile.

389
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,151
It's all right? "It's all right."
It's okay? "It's okay."

390
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:00,318
Come on.

391
00:42:00,639 --> 00:42:04,314
- We have to work.
- We're working our asses off.

392
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:08,313
- Talk to Perez. Please.
- No. Please.

393
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,835
- He's not like Luis.
- Haven't you learned anything?

394
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,116
Talk to him. Come on. Apologize.

395
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,714
What? You wanna kiss his ass?
No, we'll make a deal.

396
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:18,394
He'll slit both our throats,
the way Luis cut mine.

397
00:42:18,561 --> 00:42:20,836
He cut more than your throat.

398
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:22,599
We should have stayed in Havana.

399
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:25,558
But stay for what? Some whore
who never even loved you?

400
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:28,917
- I'm not talking about Maria.
- The whore sold herself to another man...

401
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:31,833
I'm talking about us.
We don't belong here.

402
00:42:32,001 --> 00:42:35,073
Get it through your head. She's not
waiting for you! It's a dream!

403
00:42:35,241 --> 00:42:37,596
Now, how long before
you're gonna give that up?

404
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,717
How long?

405
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:43,876
And you, Cesar?

406
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:46,952
How long before
you give up your dream?

407
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:00,715
There's no dream, man.

408
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:08,317
It's our life.

409
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:11,358
- Come on, smile, will you? Come on.
- No. No, no.

410
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:14,956
This is your life, yeah.

411
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:17,549
I feel like a ghost.

412
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:29,757
Cesar is wrong.

413
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:31,638
We won't make it.

414
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:34,268
Even if we did,
that's not what I want.

415
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:38,150
I'd be happy writing music...

416
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:41,278
...playing love songs
in my own little club.

417
00:43:41,441 --> 00:43:43,432
There is my dream.

418
00:43:43,601 --> 00:43:49,790
A nice place where people could get
Cuban food and listen to good music.

419
00:43:51,919 --> 00:43:56,037
- That's what I want.
- Nestor. Then do it.

420
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:00,590
Just open your little club. Do it.

421
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:03,430
Listen, why keep dreaming?

422
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:05,874
Make it come true.

423
00:44:06,761 --> 00:44:08,479
Do you believe in me?

424
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:11,477
Oh, yes.

425
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:13,954
You do?

426
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:16,471
Yes, I do.

427
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:52,954
I didn't want
to come to America, but...

428
00:44:53,959 --> 00:44:56,348
...my brother was right.

429
00:44:57,879 --> 00:45:00,677
If I hadn't come to America...

430
00:45:00,841 --> 00:45:03,639
<i>- ...I wouldn't have met you.
- Wouldn't have met me.</i>

431
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:05,313
Exactly.

432
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:09,997
Don't move. Don't move.

433
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:14,870
Stay like this.

434
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:32,595
Why are you laughing?

435
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:04,792
- Happy birthday.
- Thanks.

436
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:06,757
Thank you, darling.

437
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:15,313
Give me a rum there, straight up.

438
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:17,355
I need a Scotch.

439
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:22,116
Not bad for Montclair, New Jersey.
One hundred Señor Washingtons.

440
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:24,191
Life could be worse. There you go.

441
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:26,277
Swear to God.

442
00:47:28,841 --> 00:47:31,355
Listen, Cesar, we gotta talk.

443
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:35,512
Mario's got this gig with Tito Puente.

444
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:38,518
Keys has got a shot with Machito.

445
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:41,831
We want to stick together, man,
but we're falling apart.

446
00:47:42,001 --> 00:47:43,593
Can't you see that?

447
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:47,273
I don't want to carry
a bunch of losers either.

448
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:51,273
I'm going to Babalu.

449
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:54,193
- That ain't a real gig.
- Don't you tell me what a gig is.

450
00:47:54,361 --> 00:47:57,512
- Hey, Cesar. Cesar.
- Yeah?

451
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:00,479
Manny and I wanna open a club.

452
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:03,030
Don't be a child, will you, please?

453
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:04,428
Mr. Vanderbilt says...

454
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:07,634
- What you know about running a club?
- He can learn.

455
00:48:07,801 --> 00:48:09,598
Delores, it's men's business,
you know.

456
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:11,512
It's not your worth getting involved.

457
00:48:11,681 --> 00:48:14,514
Men's business has you
playing in New Jersey.

458
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:17,831
- When I want your opinion, I'll ask for it.
- Think of the future.

459
00:48:17,999 --> 00:48:21,230
- Who are you to tell me what to think?
- Don't talk to Delores that way.

460
00:48:21,401 --> 00:48:24,791
- She's gotta fight your battles for you?
- Don't talk to Delores like that.

461
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:28,589
- Don't you teach me how to talk.
- She's going to be my wife!

462
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:32,314
Nestor.

463
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:34,591
- Go on.
- Sorry.

464
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:36,794
Sorry, Delores.

465
00:48:36,961 --> 00:48:39,839
I know this is not the way
we were going to tell him, but...

466
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:43,678
Delores has consented to be my wife.

467
00:48:51,549 --> 00:48:53,938
My God. I feel like an idiot.

468
00:48:54,104 --> 00:48:56,493
No, you're not.
An animal, you're an animal.

469
00:49:09,056 --> 00:49:10,774
Are you okay?

470
00:49:12,053 --> 00:49:13,930
Yeah, you're okay.

471
00:49:22,327 --> 00:49:25,797
- I have to talk to you.
- What?

472
00:49:28,041 --> 00:49:29,759
Delores...

473
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,910
She's gonna have a baby.

474
00:49:44,955 --> 00:49:47,230
Hell of a good reason
to marry her too, kid.

475
00:49:47,909 --> 00:49:49,945
- Hell of a good reason.
- What are you saying?

476
00:49:50,108 --> 00:49:53,418
- I love her. I love Delores.
- Is Maria out of your heart now?

477
00:49:56,911 --> 00:50:00,108
Let's just thank God for that.

478
00:50:02,980 --> 00:50:05,255
Okay, you know, Cesar...

479
00:50:05,621 --> 00:50:10,058
- I was thinking about that. About Maria.
- About what? What?

480
00:50:11,173 --> 00:50:13,733
I have written her many letters.

481
00:50:14,580 --> 00:50:18,095
But she never, never answered them.

482
00:50:19,495 --> 00:50:21,213
Anyway...

483
00:50:22,288 --> 00:50:25,360
...I think Maria was right.

484
00:50:26,406 --> 00:50:28,522
- I wasn't her destiny.
- Come on.

485
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:32,992
What the hell are we talking about?
A woman like that for you?

486
00:50:33,726 --> 00:50:35,876
That's poison, kid.

487
00:50:38,836 --> 00:50:40,394
Poison.

488
00:50:43,158 --> 00:50:45,797
- But you really know now.
- What?

489
00:50:45,951 --> 00:50:47,942
How lucky you are...

490
00:50:49,357 --> 00:50:51,871
...to have a woman like Delores?

491
00:50:53,594 --> 00:50:55,346
Yes, I know. I know.

492
00:50:55,513 --> 00:50:57,344
Then what is this?

493
00:50:57,507 --> 00:51:01,216
<i>You save your pennies. You're like
a little hormiguita, opening a club.</i>

494
00:51:01,388 --> 00:51:04,903
I wanna have something
to show my wife and my baby.

495
00:51:05,064 --> 00:51:06,861
But you don't come to me?

496
00:51:07,015 --> 00:51:08,289
Yes, I do.

497
00:51:08,460 --> 00:51:11,293
- I know it's...
- Well, come on. That is it.

498
00:51:11,942 --> 00:51:14,581
A man without a family,
who the hell is that?

499
00:51:17,332 --> 00:51:19,129
That's nobody.

500
00:51:24,534 --> 00:51:29,528
- Do you know how much I love you?
- Yes, I love you too.

501
00:51:30,646 --> 00:51:32,159
You don't forget that.

502
00:51:34,117 --> 00:51:35,675
No.

503
00:51:44,553 --> 00:51:46,623
Good work, kid!

504
00:53:16,531 --> 00:53:20,001
Maria. Maria.

505
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:44,268
Dump it right on the scale.

506
00:53:45,681 --> 00:53:48,639
Delores is on the telephone.
It's her time.

507
00:53:49,756 --> 00:53:53,351
Delores! The baby! Come on!

508
00:54:00,224 --> 00:54:02,897
- He's beautiful.
- Isn't he?

509
00:54:03,986 --> 00:54:06,705
I got these for you.

510
00:54:07,145 --> 00:54:08,942
I hope they're good.

511
00:54:09,139 --> 00:54:10,333
Oh, Cesar.

512
00:54:12,341 --> 00:54:14,377
<i>Jane Eyre.</i>

513
00:54:14,540 --> 00:54:16,929
<i>Crime and Punishment.</i>

514
00:54:18,012 --> 00:54:20,446
How did you know what to choose?

515
00:54:21,688 --> 00:54:24,077
Fellow at the store, you know.

516
00:54:25,289 --> 00:54:27,359
I hope they're good.

517
00:54:32,210 --> 00:54:34,041
It's the most wonderful present.

518
00:54:34,247 --> 00:54:35,999
Thank you.

519
00:54:37,158 --> 00:54:38,716
I'm so happy for you.

520
00:54:40,521 --> 00:54:43,081
Hey, let me see him.

521
00:54:44,877 --> 00:54:46,595
He's a Castillo.

522
00:54:46,752 --> 00:54:49,585
Look at the expression on his face.

523
00:54:49,749 --> 00:54:51,626
Like a headache.

524
00:54:53,555 --> 00:54:56,831
Look at this little angel.

525
00:55:22,931 --> 00:55:26,526
- Good evening.
- Good evening. Good to see you.

526
00:56:17,534 --> 00:56:20,207
- Miguel, good to see you again, friend.
- Welcome.

527
00:56:20,380 --> 00:56:22,689
You remember Mike,
my business manager. Mike Wells.

528
00:56:22,849 --> 00:56:24,680
- Good to see you.
- Always a pleasure.

529
00:56:24,854 --> 00:56:26,731
Miguel, these fellows are fantastic.

530
00:56:26,891 --> 00:56:28,609
I'd like to invite them to our table.

531
00:56:28,767 --> 00:56:30,962
- Would you ask them to join us?
- My pleasure.

532
00:57:00,386 --> 00:57:02,138
Thank you.

533
00:57:02,467 --> 00:57:04,423
Desi Arnaz.

534
00:57:05,388 --> 00:57:08,858
Oh, my God. That's Desi Arnaz.

535
00:57:09,021 --> 00:57:11,933
- This is my manager, Mike Wells.
- Pleasure to meet you both.

536
00:57:12,104 --> 00:57:14,743
- Hi, Mike, how are you?
- Mike, hello.

537
00:57:14,897 --> 00:57:17,695
- I am so pleased to meet you.
- Me too. Me too.

538
00:57:19,133 --> 00:57:22,728
- I'm Cesar Castillo.
- I am his brother, Nestor.

539
00:57:22,939 --> 00:57:25,453
<i>Oh, gracias, gracias. What a surprise.</i>

540
00:57:25,612 --> 00:57:29,525
- What a surprise. What a nice surprise.
- Please, sit down.

541
00:57:33,406 --> 00:57:35,966
Mike and I wanted to
compliment you on your performance.

542
00:57:36,123 --> 00:57:40,480
That was a wonderful song.
"Beautiful Maria of My Soul."

543
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:43,359
I have written many different
songs of the ver... Name.

544
00:57:43,518 --> 00:57:45,634
Many different versions of the song.
Excuse me.

545
00:57:45,804 --> 00:57:47,317
Have you written any other songs?

546
00:57:47,475 --> 00:57:49,511
- Yes, a few songs.
- He's got a suitcase full.

547
00:57:49,674 --> 00:57:52,313
- A suitcase.
- Suitcase.

548
00:57:52,477 --> 00:57:54,229
So where are you fellas from in Cuba?

549
00:57:54,396 --> 00:57:55,715
Las Piñas.

550
00:57:55,873 --> 00:57:58,387
That's the sugar-mill town
in Oriente, you know that.

551
00:57:58,546 --> 00:58:00,855
So am I from Oriente too.

552
00:58:01,026 --> 00:58:02,857
Santiago.

553
00:58:03,031 --> 00:58:06,819
<i>Guess you put a couple of Cubanos
together, we're all related, right?</i>

554
00:58:09,661 --> 00:58:12,334
That calls for a celebration.

555
00:58:18,932 --> 00:58:21,571
You don't know how nice it is
to just relax for a change.

556
00:58:21,735 --> 00:58:25,694
You are probably tired of dining out
with the Rockefellers all the time.

557
00:58:25,853 --> 00:58:27,764
Rockefeller?

558
00:58:31,211 --> 00:58:34,044
We get tired of eating
with them too, you know?

559
00:58:39,167 --> 00:58:40,998
<i>Do you fellas have un conjunto?</i>

560
00:58:41,161 --> 00:58:45,040
- Yeah. We're the Mambo Kings.
- Mambo Kings?

561
00:58:45,204 --> 00:58:48,674
- Where have you been playing?
- We haven't played a gig in months.

562
00:58:49,074 --> 00:58:51,952
- We are butchers.
- What a stupid thing to say!

563
00:58:52,114 --> 00:58:54,867
But it's true, brother. It's true.

564
00:58:55,273 --> 00:58:58,788
This kid, he worries himself to death.
I tell him, everyone starts this way.

565
00:58:58,949 --> 00:59:02,066
- You don't listen to me. You no listen.
- That's how I got started.

566
00:59:02,226 --> 00:59:04,615
- I did all sorts of things.
- I know that.

567
00:59:04,792 --> 00:59:09,183
- Cleaned birdcages.
- Mr. Arnaz, this is our boy, Eugenio.

568
00:59:09,341 --> 00:59:12,811
- Please, call me Desi.
- Desi.

569
00:59:16,101 --> 00:59:19,218
How wonderful your family is,
Señora Castillo.

570
00:59:20,380 --> 00:59:23,611
Tomorrow's work. Always work.

571
00:59:23,776 --> 00:59:26,244
Sorry, I have to go.

572
00:59:26,935 --> 00:59:29,608
I wanted to tell you something
before I do.

573
00:59:29,770 --> 00:59:34,639
<i>That canción you fellows played at the
club tonight, "Beautiful Maria"?</i>

574
00:59:34,804 --> 00:59:37,113
- That's a great song. I really like it.
- Thank you.

575
00:59:37,284 --> 00:59:39,559
I want you to come on my show,
do it for me there.

576
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:41,278
Oh, that's nice.

577
00:59:41,445 --> 00:59:44,676
<i>- The nightclub show?
- No, the I Love Lucy show.</i>

578
00:59:44,884 --> 00:59:47,682
<i>- In Hollywood?
- I Love Lucy show?</i>

579
00:59:47,838 --> 00:59:50,272
- No.
- Yes, Hollywood.

580
00:59:50,641 --> 00:59:54,350
I mean, yes. Yes. Oh, my God.

581
00:59:54,511 --> 00:59:57,264
He's coming. He's coming.

582
01:00:13,625 --> 01:00:15,263
Take care of yourselves.

583
01:00:24,976 --> 01:00:27,649
My God, this is something.

584
01:00:29,095 --> 01:00:31,484
Didn't I tell you this would happen?

585
01:00:33,849 --> 01:00:35,567
It's a miracle, eh, Cesar?

586
01:00:36,404 --> 01:00:38,315
That's what you wanted.

587
01:00:50,073 --> 01:00:52,189
We're just about ready to get started.

588
01:00:52,359 --> 01:00:55,669
Tonight we have a special show
for you, entitled "Cuban Pals."

589
01:00:55,830 --> 01:00:59,618
So sit back, relax and enjoy the show.

590
01:00:59,797 --> 01:01:01,549
- My stomach is...
- Your stomach is fine.

591
01:01:01,705 --> 01:01:03,935
Come on, we never looked this good
in our lives.

592
01:01:04,109 --> 01:01:06,623
Take it easy.
Just be yourselves. Don't worry.

593
01:01:06,783 --> 01:01:08,660
Even if you flub,
we'll take care of it.

594
01:01:08,831 --> 01:01:10,742
We're no flubs.

595
01:01:11,580 --> 01:01:13,730
- Let's go!
- Okay, let's go.

596
01:01:13,898 --> 01:01:16,207
What the hell is that?
Oh, jeez.

597
01:01:16,377 --> 01:01:18,015
- Hey, you all right?
- I'm all right.

598
01:01:18,178 --> 01:01:21,648
- Are you sure? If you want...
- I want. Don't worry about it.

599
01:01:21,821 --> 01:01:24,255
I want. You gotta be kidding me.

600
01:01:30,888 --> 01:01:33,197
The light. Carmen, the light.

601
01:01:33,410 --> 01:01:35,048
I'm so proud.

602
01:01:40,450 --> 01:01:42,281
<i>Lucy.</i>

603
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:48,593
<i>- Cesar, Nestor, this is Lucy.
- How do you do?</i>

604
01:01:51,241 --> 01:01:53,675
<i>What kind of a girl
did you think Ricky would marry?</i>

605
01:01:56,071 --> 01:01:58,983
<i>No, don 't tell me.
I shouldn 't have asked that.</i>

606
01:02:01,030 --> 01:02:03,783
<i>Ricky told me
all about your success in Cuba.</i>

607
01:02:03,951 --> 01:02:06,306
<i>Where do you think
you'll go from here?</i>

608
01:02:08,792 --> 01:02:10,544
They don't understand.

609
01:02:10,711 --> 01:02:12,702
<i>Do you know
where you'll go from here?</i>

610
01:02:21,178 --> 01:02:25,456
I think Lucy likes Nestor,
Delores. Yes?

611
01:02:26,773 --> 01:02:28,206
<i>"We 'doughnut."'</i>

612
01:02:29,134 --> 01:02:30,806
<i>"Wee doughnut"?</i>

613
01:02:30,967 --> 01:02:33,527
<i>Sounds like someplace in Arkansas.</i>

614
01:02:38,847 --> 01:02:42,840
<i>We "doughnut" speak English.</i>

615
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:48,956
<i>You do not speak English. Oh, well...</i>

616
01:02:52,043 --> 01:02:53,761
<i>Well.</i>

617
01:02:54,511 --> 01:02:58,060
- Can you believe he was in the kitchen?
- I can't believe I missed that.

618
01:02:58,231 --> 01:03:01,268
<i>- Did you have a nice talk?
- I had a nice talk.</i>

619
01:03:17,463 --> 01:03:19,294
<i>Beg pardon?</i>

620
01:03:19,457 --> 01:03:22,813
<i>He wants to know
if the color of your hair is natural.</i>

621
01:03:22,982 --> 01:03:25,576
<i>Oh, well, certainly,
tell them it's natural.</i>

622
01:03:25,731 --> 01:03:28,040
<i>And my father and mother
both had red hair.</i>

623
01:03:30,658 --> 01:03:33,377
Yeah, and my parents had blond hair too.

624
01:03:33,774 --> 01:03:35,127
- Sure.
- They did!

625
01:03:35,294 --> 01:03:38,172
<i>Well, Ricky, go ahead and tell them.</i>

626
01:03:45,319 --> 01:03:50,109
<i>- Henna rinse.
- Ah, henna rinse.</i>

627
01:03:58,073 --> 01:04:01,952
<i>I have an idea my hair
suffered in the translation.</i>

628
01:04:07,074 --> 01:04:12,432
I saw Lucy once, standing outside the
Lord & Taylor's during Christmastime.

629
01:04:12,583 --> 01:04:15,017
- Oh, she seemed very nice.
- Oh, she is.

630
01:04:15,181 --> 01:04:18,332
- You can tell just by looking at her.
- Come on, it's starting!

631
01:04:18,545 --> 01:04:20,615
Come on, let's go.

632
01:04:22,814 --> 01:04:25,248
<i>Well, folks, tonight I have
a special treat for you.</i>

633
01:04:25,412 --> 01:04:29,246
<i>It's my pleasure to present to you,
direct from Havana, Cuba...</i>

634
01:04:29,411 --> 01:04:33,404
<i>... Cesar and Nestor Castillo, singing
a bolero of their own composition:</i>

635
01:04:33,572 --> 01:04:35,483
<i>"Beautiful Maria of My Soul."</i>

636
01:06:03,395 --> 01:06:05,955
<i>Telephone for Mr. Goodson.</i>

637
01:06:06,111 --> 01:06:07,863
<i>Telephone.</i>

638
01:06:55,442 --> 01:06:58,320
You know, I was in a movie once
with Ricardo Montalban.

639
01:06:58,472 --> 01:07:00,508
<i>Desperados From
The Land of the Golden Sun.</i>

640
01:07:00,671 --> 01:07:04,061
Oh, Ricardo was a dreamboat.

641
01:07:04,228 --> 01:07:07,982
You are a fleet of dreamboats.
I'm gonna put you in my next movie.

642
01:07:08,153 --> 01:07:09,427
Do you have a part for me?

643
01:07:09,586 --> 01:07:12,305
- Hey!
- Come on, let's not get stingy, huh?

644
01:07:12,465 --> 01:07:14,296
<i>Paging Mr. Castillo.</i>

645
01:07:14,470 --> 01:07:17,189
And I'm gonna form
an all-girls' orchestra with you too.

646
01:07:17,348 --> 01:07:19,464
I'll be right back,
I'm gonna tune you all up.

647
01:07:19,623 --> 01:07:22,501
Oh, don't go. Don't go.

648
01:07:23,741 --> 01:07:26,653
<i>You wait for me, muchachas, huh?</i>

649
01:07:26,813 --> 01:07:28,769
Don't you go away.

650
01:07:29,411 --> 01:07:32,244
Delores is on the phone.
She wants to tell you she loves you.

651
01:07:32,419 --> 01:07:35,934
Sorry. Your phone has been busy.

652
01:07:39,448 --> 01:07:41,916
No, no, no.

653
01:07:42,089 --> 01:07:44,683
No, see... See you later.

654
01:08:05,396 --> 01:08:07,591
What the hell are you looking at?

655
01:08:08,027 --> 01:08:10,780
<i>You follow your pinga
wherever it goes, brother.</i>

656
01:08:10,991 --> 01:08:14,063
Hey, I don't have no wife,
no son who loves me.

657
01:08:14,269 --> 01:08:17,227
You worrying about me?
Thank you, brother.

658
01:08:18,667 --> 01:08:19,986
<i>You're turning into a cabrón.</i>

659
01:08:21,060 --> 01:08:22,698
<i>A cabrón would have
gone back by now.</i>

660
01:08:22,861 --> 01:08:24,419
- Back to Cuba?
- Yes.

661
01:08:24,586 --> 01:08:27,464
Yes, you are the one that
wanted to come to New York.

662
01:08:27,615 --> 01:08:30,493
You're a big shot now on television
with Mr. Desi Arnaz.

663
01:08:30,655 --> 01:08:33,488
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah. Do you want to go back to Cuba?

664
01:08:33,857 --> 01:08:35,927
I never wanted to be a big shot!

665
01:08:36,088 --> 01:08:40,240
Why...? Why do I always have to do
what you want? Why, brother?

666
01:08:40,411 --> 01:08:44,962
Maybe without me, you'll be singing
your love songs in a shower somewhere.

667
01:08:45,122 --> 01:08:48,159
That would be good enough.
You can't keep using me, Cesar.

668
01:08:48,324 --> 01:08:50,792
What the hell you talking about?
I use you?

669
01:08:50,965 --> 01:08:53,240
No, no, no.
No, I do it for you!

670
01:08:53,402 --> 01:08:56,280
I do it for you! And I did it for you!
Get the hell out...

671
01:08:56,442 --> 01:08:58,956
You don't even know how lucky you are,
you know that?

672
01:08:59,115 --> 01:09:01,788
Lucky in Cuba with Maria.
No other way!

673
01:09:01,994 --> 01:09:03,666
- You wanna talk about Maria?
- Yes!

674
01:09:03,837 --> 01:09:05,953
Get the hell out of my life.
You make me sick.

675
01:09:06,155 --> 01:09:08,271
- Your stupid life wasn't worth saving.
- Saving?

676
01:09:08,429 --> 01:09:10,863
- You don't know anything.
- What are you talking about?

677
01:09:11,071 --> 01:09:14,620
If I hadn't brought you to America,
you'd be playing trumpet with angels.

678
01:09:14,822 --> 01:09:18,132
- What do you mean? Please.
- Stay the hell out of my way.

679
01:09:18,347 --> 01:09:20,986
- Tell me, brother!
- You want to talk to me about Maria?

680
01:09:21,139 --> 01:09:24,176
Maria begged me. She begged me
to take you out of Cuba!

681
01:09:24,341 --> 01:09:28,334
- Yeah, Luis would have slit your throat.
- Lies. Lies, it's not true.

682
01:09:28,503 --> 01:09:31,939
If she hadn't married him,
he'd have killed you. She saved you.

683
01:09:33,138 --> 01:09:35,288
And I called her a whore. A whore?

684
01:09:35,456 --> 01:09:38,095
She's too good for you.
Delores is too good for you!

685
01:09:38,291 --> 01:09:40,122
We're all too good for you!

686
01:09:40,533 --> 01:09:42,091
Stop it!

687
01:09:56,036 --> 01:09:59,346
You knew this about Maria
and didn't tell me?

688
01:10:00,078 --> 01:10:01,830
Why, brother?

689
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:04,633
Why?

690
01:10:08,476 --> 01:10:11,991
- To save your life.
- My life?

691
01:10:13,273 --> 01:10:15,389
Why do you think why?

692
01:10:17,424 --> 01:10:20,336
You didn't save my life, Cesar.

693
01:10:20,507 --> 01:10:22,975
You ruined my life.

694
01:10:38,651 --> 01:10:40,209
No.

695
01:11:12,350 --> 01:11:15,786
Five thousand bucks
from Desilu Productions.

696
01:11:17,190 --> 01:11:19,988
And God bless this country!

697
01:11:20,187 --> 01:11:22,826
<i>Not bad for one little bolero, bro!</i>

698
01:11:23,465 --> 01:11:26,457
Now let's see Perez try to keep us
from playing the Palladium.

699
01:11:26,623 --> 01:11:30,821
Delores, the salesman said he's gonna
send a new encyclopedia every month.

700
01:11:30,979 --> 01:11:33,254
- I want to show you something.
- It's so beautiful.

701
01:11:34,816 --> 01:11:38,126
It's got power steering.
Power brakes. Power everything.

702
01:11:44,605 --> 01:11:47,722
- You're crazy.
- I guess Mr. Vanderbilt was right, bro.

703
01:11:48,648 --> 01:11:51,037
"Chinaman, Indian
or from the planet Cuba..."

704
01:11:51,246 --> 01:11:53,077
- Cuba!
- Cuba!

705
01:11:53,240 --> 01:11:56,550
"...a man can find happiness
the American way!"

706
01:11:56,722 --> 01:11:58,678
Whether he likes it or not.

707
01:11:58,835 --> 01:12:01,986
- Cut the cake and pour champagne.
- Don't wet the check.

708
01:12:02,199 --> 01:12:05,828
- Don't wet the check.
- Don't wet that check, please.

709
01:12:15,674 --> 01:12:17,266
You're on top of the world.

710
01:12:18,110 --> 01:12:20,260
<i>Don't be so modesto.</i>

711
01:12:20,784 --> 01:12:22,775
We are working.

712
01:12:23,220 --> 01:12:26,257
Nothing that will make us rich...

713
01:12:26,422 --> 01:12:29,459
...but we are bringing in
a few dollars, and...

714
01:12:29,624 --> 01:12:31,694
Well, you seem in good shape.

715
01:12:31,855 --> 01:12:33,493
Is a good beginning.

716
01:12:33,699 --> 01:12:38,136
No. It's okay for the time being.
But we have a long way to go.

717
01:12:38,291 --> 01:12:41,727
Then we shouldn't lose more time
in our friendship.

718
01:12:42,334 --> 01:12:46,486
So, Nestor, what is it I can do for you?

719
01:12:48,252 --> 01:12:51,562
Do you need money? Please tell me.

720
01:12:52,403 --> 01:12:53,756
I want to open a club.

721
01:12:53,966 --> 01:12:55,843
Good, good.

722
01:12:56,004 --> 01:12:59,201
My brother doesn't think
this is the time to settle down.

723
01:12:59,356 --> 01:13:02,075
He thinks that we will be stars.

724
01:13:04,315 --> 01:13:07,352
But you are the one
who writes the songs, no?

725
01:13:07,517 --> 01:13:12,466
And your brother,
he doesn't want anyone to own him.

726
01:13:15,667 --> 01:13:18,386
But he thinks he owns you.

727
01:13:26,102 --> 01:13:27,740
No.

728
01:13:27,903 --> 01:13:30,098
Cesar does not own me.

729
01:13:30,264 --> 01:13:32,414
Nobody does.

730
01:13:32,581 --> 01:13:33,934
Nobody.

731
01:13:34,101 --> 01:13:36,820
<i>Then you sign with me, mi amigo...</i>

732
01:13:36,980 --> 01:13:39,096
...and your future is gold.

733
01:13:39,653 --> 01:13:42,725
El Morocco, the Palladium...

734
01:13:42,888 --> 01:13:46,437
...and then your own little club.

735
01:13:47,210 --> 01:13:48,882
Palladium.

736
01:13:50,606 --> 01:13:52,244
Yes.

737
01:13:55,080 --> 01:13:58,789
Let's drink to my freedom.
I'm gonna play the Palladium.

738
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:05,590
I'm going to open my own little club
in Havana.

739
01:14:06,195 --> 01:14:08,311
Without Cesar.

740
01:14:08,480 --> 01:14:12,234
Honey, you really are seeing
pink elephants.

741
01:14:13,030 --> 01:14:14,668
No.

742
01:14:17,266 --> 01:14:20,303
<i>Adiós, Mambo Kings.</i>

743
01:14:21,341 --> 01:14:23,730
<i>Adiós, Cesar!</i>

744
01:14:24,942 --> 01:14:27,012
Nestor, what happened?

745
01:14:27,184 --> 01:14:29,698
Let's drink to my freedom.

746
01:14:29,858 --> 01:14:32,292
Let's drink to my freedom.

747
01:14:33,739 --> 01:14:36,378
Bartender. No coffee.

748
01:14:36,542 --> 01:14:40,330
<i>Two Nestor Libres.</i>

749
01:14:45,371 --> 01:14:47,646
Cesar can't keep using me.

750
01:14:47,807 --> 01:14:50,002
I told him that.

751
01:14:50,168 --> 01:14:52,557
Nestor, he's your brother,
your family.

752
01:14:53,284 --> 01:14:55,593
What's a guy without a family?

753
01:14:57,078 --> 01:14:58,670
Nothing.

754
01:15:00,442 --> 01:15:02,717
Double nothing without love.

755
01:15:04,603 --> 01:15:06,958
You know how that is, don't you?

756
01:15:09,756 --> 01:15:12,589
To love someone so much?

757
01:15:21,463 --> 01:15:23,931
Nestor, can't you see
how Cesar feels...?

758
01:15:24,105 --> 01:15:26,016
About Delores?

759
01:15:43,650 --> 01:15:46,369
Stop being a big jerk, huh?

760
01:15:48,846 --> 01:15:51,121
He'd do anything for you.

761
01:15:52,328 --> 01:15:55,479
Please, don't break his heart.

762
01:16:32,582 --> 01:16:34,254
Nestor.

763
01:16:35,503 --> 01:16:38,222
I want to go back to school
and be a teacher.

764
01:16:44,052 --> 01:16:48,330
I want to go back to school
and make something of myself.

765
01:16:48,494 --> 01:16:50,325
Yeah.

766
01:16:51,404 --> 01:16:53,793
Yeah, you should do that.

767
01:16:55,770 --> 01:16:58,330
That's what you wanted
before you...

768
01:16:59,242 --> 01:17:00,470
...met me.

769
01:17:06,120 --> 01:17:07,838
Delores.

770
01:17:12,113 --> 01:17:16,345
I know it's been very hard for you.

771
01:17:17,827 --> 01:17:20,864
I never meant it to be that way.

772
01:17:22,624 --> 01:17:26,537
But you must know, in my own way...

773
01:17:27,820 --> 01:17:29,094
...I have loved you.

774
01:17:30,742 --> 01:17:32,653
I have loved you.

775
01:17:42,493 --> 01:17:45,530
I love this country!

776
01:17:45,694 --> 01:17:47,366
Where is everybody?

777
01:17:49,931 --> 01:17:51,887
I love this country!

778
01:17:52,044 --> 01:17:54,558
Come here. Come here,
you wanna see something?

779
01:17:57,208 --> 01:17:58,960
Compliments of Mr. Ricci.

780
01:17:59,127 --> 01:18:01,402
With an invitation
to play the Palladium.

781
01:18:09,239 --> 01:18:12,709
Did I tell you this would happen?
That we'd make it on our own? Did I?

782
01:18:19,556 --> 01:18:21,114
<i>Come on, toma.</i>

783
01:18:45,288 --> 01:18:49,076
That's for real.
From now on we get what we want.

784
01:18:49,288 --> 01:18:51,518
Maybe even our own television show.

785
01:18:51,724 --> 01:18:53,316
I mean, what the hell.

786
01:18:53,492 --> 01:18:57,644
What the hell did we come
to this country for if not for that?

787
01:18:57,923 --> 01:18:59,914
Come on, let's call the fellas.

788
01:19:00,079 --> 01:19:02,593
Come on. Can you imagine,
we call the fellas now?

789
01:19:02,763 --> 01:19:06,438
We tell them the Kings of the Mambo
are going to play Palladium?

790
01:19:09,156 --> 01:19:12,592
I think I'm having a heart attack today.
I gotta find a cigar or something.

791
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:16,679
How many times? How many?
Did I keep my promise to you?

792
01:19:16,832 --> 01:19:19,630
Did I keep my promise to you?

793
01:19:43,136 --> 01:19:46,173
<i>And now, ladies and gentlemen,
the song you've been waiting for...</i>

794
01:19:46,338 --> 01:19:47,612
...so patiently.

795
01:19:53,884 --> 01:19:58,719
I predict that Nestor Castillo
will be remembered among the greats.

796
01:19:58,886 --> 01:20:02,037
With Machito, Puente, Beny Moré,
Tito Rodriguez...

797
01:20:02,207 --> 01:20:04,004
I never told my brother about the deal.

798
01:20:04,158 --> 01:20:05,989
Oh, believe you me...

799
01:20:06,163 --> 01:20:09,155
...your brother will thank you for it
in his sunset years.

800
01:20:09,322 --> 01:20:11,961
No, Señor Perez. No.

801
01:20:12,114 --> 01:20:15,424
A promoter I know, an Englishman...

802
01:20:15,596 --> 01:20:19,145
...wants to mount a show
at the London Palladium.

803
01:20:19,315 --> 01:20:21,226
Of course, I told him about you.

804
01:20:21,945 --> 01:20:24,379
It's all being planned right now.
And who knows?

805
01:20:24,544 --> 01:20:27,217
Stop, Señor Perez, stop.

806
01:20:28,069 --> 01:20:30,344
I've made a mistake.

807
01:20:30,699 --> 01:20:32,735
I can't do it.

808
01:20:32,898 --> 01:20:34,775
I can't.

809
01:20:36,025 --> 01:20:37,743
Nobody owns the Castillo brothers.

810
01:20:37,900 --> 01:20:40,130
All right, Nestor.

811
01:20:41,102 --> 01:20:43,218
Then tonight's your last night.

812
01:20:43,377 --> 01:20:46,016
Tell that to your brother.

813
01:21:57,330 --> 01:21:59,764
Oh, God, Delores should be
with us tonight.

814
01:21:59,928 --> 01:22:01,202
The baby has a fever.

815
01:22:01,362 --> 01:22:03,796
Listen to him, Señor Sensible here.

816
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:06,076
Brother, I have something to tell you.

817
01:22:06,246 --> 01:22:09,363
It's a long way from Havana, kid.
You see that?

818
01:22:09,555 --> 01:22:11,864
Mambo Kings, baby.

819
01:22:12,035 --> 01:22:13,468
Mambo Kings forever.

820
01:22:13,641 --> 01:22:16,235
- Give me the keys.
- Give him the keys.

821
01:22:16,390 --> 01:22:18,142
- I'm gonna drive.
- Give him the keys!

822
01:22:18,309 --> 01:22:22,587
All right! Get in the car
before I turn into a Popsicle.

823
01:22:22,794 --> 01:22:25,149
Come to think of it,
you'd probably love that.

824
01:22:35,105 --> 01:22:38,017
Gonna turn me into
a roast-pork sandwich, huh?

825
01:22:38,177 --> 01:22:39,530
I might.

826
01:22:39,740 --> 01:22:41,856
Well, get going.

827
01:22:47,330 --> 01:22:48,922
You know, brother...

828
01:22:49,098 --> 01:22:51,054
<i>...we didn't get the job
the way you think.</i>

829
01:22:51,211 --> 01:22:55,284
There's plenty of time to talk.
We're on top, kid. Just enjoy it.

830
01:23:13,634 --> 01:23:16,467
What the hell are you doing?
You're choking me. Are you crazy?

831
01:23:16,674 --> 01:23:18,904
Come on, honey.

832
01:23:19,078 --> 01:23:20,830
- Come on.
- God help me.

833
01:23:23,951 --> 01:23:27,023
Where are we? Oh, Jesus.

834
01:23:28,026 --> 01:23:30,859
What the hell did he do?
He smashed up the goddamn car.

835
01:23:31,023 --> 01:23:32,741
What do you people think I'm made of?

836
01:23:32,909 --> 01:23:34,661
- Come on, Cesar.
- Look at that.

837
01:23:34,828 --> 01:23:36,944
What a waste.

838
01:23:38,666 --> 01:23:42,420
The insurance company
will buy another one.

839
01:23:44,660 --> 01:23:45,979
What happened?

840
01:23:48,530 --> 01:23:49,929
What happened?

841
01:24:13,077 --> 01:24:14,510
Oh, God.

842
01:24:21,518 --> 01:24:22,792
Nestor.

843
01:24:27,350 --> 01:24:28,942
Nestor.

844
01:24:31,663 --> 01:24:33,096
Nestor.

845
01:24:37,700 --> 01:24:39,099
Nestor!

846
01:25:01,611 --> 01:25:03,169
<i>Cesar!</i>

847
01:25:05,448 --> 01:25:07,120
Cesar!

848
01:25:11,884 --> 01:25:13,556
Cesar.

849
01:25:18,320 --> 01:25:21,756
Hey, mister. Mister, throw me the ball.

850
01:25:21,910 --> 01:25:24,219
- Come on, let's go, let's go.
- Let's play.

851
01:25:24,389 --> 01:25:25,788
- All right, ready?
- Come on.

852
01:25:25,996 --> 01:25:27,668
Ready? Here we go.

853
01:25:32,184 --> 01:25:33,822
- Stop.
- No.

854
01:25:37,261 --> 01:25:39,855
Come on. Come on...

855
01:25:41,056 --> 01:25:44,128
- Stop. It's no use.
- What?

856
01:25:45,821 --> 01:25:47,971
Stop acting like a little girl.

857
01:25:50,090 --> 01:25:53,719
I'm about as far from
a little girl as you can get.

858
01:26:03,889 --> 01:26:06,244
It's over, Cesar.

859
01:26:07,285 --> 01:26:08,877
It's over.

860
01:26:10,400 --> 01:26:12,709
There's nothing I can do for you.

861
01:26:12,880 --> 01:26:14,677
I'm drunk.

862
01:26:15,241 --> 01:26:19,519
Don't you see that? I'm drunk.

863
01:26:28,306 --> 01:26:30,456
I'm gonna miss you.

864
01:26:39,421 --> 01:26:40,820
What?

865
01:26:45,857 --> 01:26:49,088
What can I do?

866
01:27:07,720 --> 01:27:09,392
Cesar?

867
01:27:10,727 --> 01:27:12,797
Cesar.

868
01:27:13,563 --> 01:27:15,599
Cesar.

869
01:27:15,762 --> 01:27:17,434
Evalina.

870
01:27:17,594 --> 01:27:19,585
Oh, my God.

871
01:27:20,279 --> 01:27:22,793
You know,
I thought you were my mother.

872
01:27:22,952 --> 01:27:25,910
Cesar, Miguel tells me
you left the band.

873
01:27:26,068 --> 01:27:27,706
Yeah, it's better this way.

874
01:27:27,868 --> 01:27:30,382
Come, sit. Sit, sit, sit.

875
01:27:31,674 --> 01:27:34,950
My God.
I thought you were my mother.

876
01:27:35,501 --> 01:27:39,050
Cesar, when my mother died...

877
01:27:39,780 --> 01:27:42,738
...I wanted only to live in my sadness.

878
01:27:43,586 --> 01:27:47,465
It was all I thought I had left of her.

879
01:27:48,178 --> 01:27:51,807
But the music within me...

880
01:27:51,973 --> 01:27:54,533
...would not be silent.

881
01:27:54,690 --> 01:27:56,965
And when I finally sang...

882
01:27:57,137 --> 01:28:01,415
...I found my mother
in the happiness of the people.

883
01:28:01,923 --> 01:28:03,800
That kid...

884
01:28:06,203 --> 01:28:07,636
He was the music.

885
01:28:07,810 --> 01:28:10,040
And so are you.

886
01:28:10,720 --> 01:28:13,314
Fire and water.

887
01:28:14,041 --> 01:28:16,555
Both beautiful, Cesar.

888
01:28:16,714 --> 01:28:20,024
But they have different life.

889
01:28:24,595 --> 01:28:29,794
"In today's America,
every obstacle is temporary.

890
01:28:30,394 --> 01:28:32,988
Every problem can be solved.

891
01:28:35,030 --> 01:28:39,148
Where there is a will, there is a way...

892
01:28:40,345 --> 01:28:42,575
...for the man of tomorrow...

893
01:28:43,945 --> 01:28:46,300
<i>...in today's America."</i>

894
01:29:03,727 --> 01:29:06,002
We gotta take a vacation, you and me.

895
01:29:06,164 --> 01:29:08,724
We gotta go down to Miami, huh?

896
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:12,589
And if we're too big in Miami,
we'll go straight back to Hollywood.

897
01:29:14,281 --> 01:29:16,670
We'll go see Desi.
Remember what he told us?

898
01:29:16,836 --> 01:29:20,909
We could always just drop by.

899
01:29:32,910 --> 01:29:34,707
What's the matter?

900
01:29:38,624 --> 01:29:40,455
I know.

901
01:29:58,815 --> 01:30:02,125
"Chinaman, Indian
or from the planet Mars...

902
01:30:03,009 --> 01:30:07,082
...a man can find happiness
the American way."

903
01:30:11,083 --> 01:30:14,553
I guess you couldn't
find happiness after all.

904
01:31:00,253 --> 01:31:02,005
We want to make a toast...

905
01:31:02,172 --> 01:31:06,563
...to our friend whose dream it was
to someday have a little club.

906
01:31:06,732 --> 01:31:09,121
Nestor Castillo.

907
01:31:10,289 --> 01:31:12,598
May he rest in peace.

908
01:31:14,321 --> 01:31:18,951
But as not to let this little
gathering slip into sadness...

909
01:31:19,118 --> 01:31:21,074
...I make a toast...

910
01:31:21,393 --> 01:31:25,784
...to all the lovely ladies who have
brought us warm smiles.

911
01:31:25,996 --> 01:31:28,590
- To the fabulous Mambo Kings!
- And Tito Puente!

912
01:31:28,756 --> 01:31:30,747
And to Cesar Castillo.

913
01:31:30,912 --> 01:31:32,630
To America.

914
01:31:34,470 --> 01:31:39,100
<i>And now, ladies and gentlemen,
a little canción that will live forever:</i>

915
01:31:39,310 --> 01:31:41,619
"Beautiful Maria of My Soul."

916
01:31:45,498 --> 01:31:47,773
Cesar, come on up here.

917
01:31:47,978 --> 01:31:49,252
No, you play now.

918
01:31:49,422 --> 01:31:51,219
- Cesar.
- Go on.

919
01:31:52,462 --> 01:31:54,293
Sing it for Nestor.

920
01:32:08,848 --> 01:32:10,839
He worshiped you, Cesar.

921
01:32:11,360 --> 01:32:16,354
He was always happy to go with you
to places to play for the people.

922
01:32:16,567 --> 01:32:18,603
Those were good times.

923
01:32:20,200 --> 01:32:22,111
Nobody can take that away.

924
01:32:24,361 --> 01:32:26,636
I hurt him in so many ways.

925
01:32:26,830 --> 01:32:28,900
Oh, no, Cesar.

926
01:32:30,032 --> 01:32:31,943
You didn't hurt him.

927
01:32:34,075 --> 01:32:35,667
Nestor...

928
01:32:38,063 --> 01:32:40,179
Nestor hurt himself.

929
01:32:42,828 --> 01:32:44,181
Nobody could save him.

930
01:32:45,459 --> 01:32:48,371
You know, everything I was in my life...

931
01:32:48,898 --> 01:32:51,014
...was because of him.

932
01:32:54,061 --> 01:32:57,019
I would change places with him
right now...

933
01:32:59,214 --> 01:33:01,125
...if I could.

934
01:33:02,847 --> 01:33:04,121
It's his club.

935
01:33:04,292 --> 01:33:07,090
Cesar, this is your club.

936
01:33:09,370 --> 01:33:11,088
Now sing the bolero.

937
01:33:11,601 --> 01:33:14,240
I don't have it in me anymore to sing.

938
01:33:18,921 --> 01:33:20,752
Sing it for me.
