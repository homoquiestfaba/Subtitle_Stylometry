00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
- Demi-plie...

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
And up.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Demi-plie...

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
And up.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Grand plie.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Back straight,
Cindy.

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
There you go.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
And 3...And 4.
Port de bras.

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000

00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
And 2...

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
And 3...

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
And slowly,

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
with the music.

14
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
And 1...

15
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
And 2...

16
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
And 3...

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
And

18
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000

00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
And 2...

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
And 3...

21
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
And 4...

22
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Port de bras forward.

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Phoebe,
I don’t think so.

24
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
2...and up.

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
3...and 4.
Like a tree.

26
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
And 1..

27
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
And 2...

28
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
And 3.

29
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Fourth position,
please. And...

30
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Captioning made possible by
hallmark channel

31
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
to the side.

32
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Arabesque.

33
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Arabesque.

34
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
To the sides
and back and...

35
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
1...2...

36
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000

And 1...2...

00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
3...4.

40
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
And 1...2...

41
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000

42
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
And 1...2...3...4.

43
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
And down...Rest.

44
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
- I think every
member of congress

45
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
should start the day
with a ballet class.

46
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
- Oh, mother.

47
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
- There she is,
belle of the ballet.

48
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
- Hello, dear.

49
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
- Let me take that
for you. How’d it go?

50
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
- Ah, kicked up
a storm.

51
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
- Hey, come on, you two.
I’m going to be late
for my breakfast.

52
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
- Come here.
- Phoebe, let him go.

53
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
- Nell, if we want
this reforestation bill to fly,

54
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
we need a right arm
in the senate.

55
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
So if you get senator Dietz
to show up at the benefit...

56
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
- Oh, he’ll be there.
I talked to his wife

57
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
at that ridiculous
luncheon for Washington spouses.

58
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Your father adored it.

59
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
- Dietz’ office
still hasn’t confirmed.

60
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
- I’ll pin him down
at the breakfast this
morning. What else?

61
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
- We need to be back
at the office by 10:00.

62
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I’ve set up
a conference call

63
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
with representatives
Deming and Schofield

64
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
on that education
initiative.

65
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
- Forget the call.
I’ve already
talked to pat.

66
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Just send Joel over
with the proposal.

67
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
- Proposal to Schofield
yesterday.

68
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
- Charlie,
I hate that thing.

69
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
- Good. I’ll get you one.

70
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
- You all right, sweetie?
Hmm? All right.

71
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
- O.K. Bye.
Sweetie, you drive carefully.

72
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
All right?
Talk to you later. O.K.? Bye.

73
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Charlie, come on!

74
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
- See ya later.
I’ll call ya.

75
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
- Here we are.
- Senators!

76
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
- Hi.
- Hi. Yes.

77
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
- Good to see you.

78
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
- Kelly Ryan.
- How are you?

79
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
- Hello.
- You know Mrs. Harrington.

80
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
- We should go on in.
- Good to see you.

81
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
- I’m glad
we caught up with you.

82
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Good morning, everybody.

83
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
- Hey, good morning.
How’d the breakfast go?

84
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
- I think we got
senator Dietz
in our pocket.

85
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
- She nailed it.
- All right.

86
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
- Anything drastic
this morning?

87
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
- A fund request,
ozone layer statistics,

88
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Doreen is typing
your speech
for tomorrow.

89
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
- Great. I can’t wait
to read it.

90
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
- Asap.
- No. As soon as possible.

91
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
- Hey, Charlie,
environmental protection
fund sent me the press kit

92
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
for the global warming
benefit.

93
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Nice profile on Nell.
Featured speaker.

94
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
- This is great.
Sarah, call Leanne at EPF.

95
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Tell her Dietz
is a yes.

96
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
- Leanne’s getting me
a list of photo ops.

97
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Looks like they’ve lined up
some really heavy hitters.

98
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
- Tell them to
go full court press.

99
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Joel, run this over to
Pat Schofield’s office.

100
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
- Got it.

101
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
- What is this
on the fax machine?

102
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
- Junk mail.
A Chinese menu.

103
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,000
- Listen, don’t anybody
order from panda Jade
garden, right?

104
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
- Your 10:00 is early.
Jerry...

105
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
- Barbetto, right.

106
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
- I gave him a decaf
and sent him inside.

107
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
- Nell, when you
get a minute,
it’s from EPF.

108
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
- Good.
Oh, we got this.

109
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
[Buzzer]

110
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
They ready to vote?
What bill?

111
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
- Medicare.
- It’s about time.

112
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
- Nell, your call
to representative Deming?

113
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
- Just table it.

114
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Mr. Barbetto,
I am so sorry.

115
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

116
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
- I’ve just been called
over to the chambers.

117
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
You wanna walk over with me?

118
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
- After you.
- Good.

119
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
- All right, y’all.
See you later.

120
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
- Bye.
- I’ll make the call.

121
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
- Whereas the disadvantaged kids

122
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
in our healthy start programs

123
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
test better emotionally,

124
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
educationally,
and nutritionally.

125
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
We have a study
from Miami medical...

126
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Rock solid statistics.

127
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
The only thing we don’t
have is adequate funding.

128
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Yeah. Isn’t that
always the way?

129
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Listen, why don’t you
send me that Miami study

130
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
and anything else you’ve got?
All right?

131
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
This slots right into that
legislation I’m working on.

132
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
- It’s a pleasure to meet you.

133
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
- Well, let’s see if
we can do some good.

134
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Good-bye. Hi.

135
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:02,000
- Now, active
labor contraction. And, go.

136
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
- [Short breaths]

137
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
- Perfect. You’ve got that down.

138
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
All right,
let’s try the next.

139
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Yes, I’m very proud
of us, o.K.?

140
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Now you’re
dilating more.

141
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
We’re going
to switch over

142
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
to pattern pace
breathing.

143
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
All right? O.K.

144
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
[Quick breaths]

145
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
- I hope you’re this calm
when the baby comes.

146
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
- I can’t wait.
Just watch my fingers.

147
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
- You can’t count, Charlie!

148
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
- Would you stop it?
Just breathe, o.K.?

149
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
- I’m getting
the urge to push.

150
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
- Well, blow. Blow.

151
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Hello. I hope
you’re getting
all of this.

152
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
- No, the baby seems
to be napping...For once.

153
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
- I love this.

154
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
- I love you.

155
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
What?

156
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
-Nothing.
I’ll be right back.

157
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
- What, do you have to?

158
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
- I’m not pregnant.

159
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
- I know.

160
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
- You’re the best.

161
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
- You’re blocking the view.

162
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
- Something over
in this corner
over here?

163
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
- O.K., hit me
with the spot.

164
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
- Now, she obviously isn’t
as tall as you are, right?

165
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
- Obviously.

166
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
- So we’re going to
have to raise the light
up a little bit

167
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
so there’s
no Mike shadow on her.

168
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Or we could just move
the light to the other side,

169
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
and then we wouldn’t
have to worry about
that Mike shadow at all.

170
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
- I’ll wait outside.

171
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
- Testing. How’s this
for volume?

172
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
- Where the hell’s
that music guy?

173
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
- Hey, Phoebe.

174
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
- What are you doing here?

175
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
- How about a hello?

176
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I heard Nell
was the main event,

177
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
but I didn’t expect
to see you.

178
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Does this mean
you’re back in her club?

179
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
- A lot of changes, frank.

180
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
- So I see.

181
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
When’s the baby due?

182
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
- Uh...six weeks,
five days.

183
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
- Hey, you look good.

184
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
- I feel good.

185
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
- Where you singing
these days?

186
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
- I’m not.
- Oh, come on.

187
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
- Something about
doing torch songs

188
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
in a slinky, black
maternity dress.

189
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
- Sounds very nineties.

190
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
- I quit, frank.
My life was a mess.

191
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I’m much happier now.
I don’t miss it.

192
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
- Did I say you did?

193
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
- Then stop smiling.

194
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
- I’m happy to see you.

195
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
- Long time.

196
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
- Eh, not so terribly long.

197
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
- Oh, there you are.

198
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
If you could just
sit at the piano
for a minute,

199
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
we need
to set levels.

200
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
- Frank, Charlie Ryan.
We talked on the phone.

201
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I really liked
your demo tape.

202
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
- Thanks.

203
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
- This is my wife,
Phoebe.

204
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
- Yes. We’ve met.

205
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
- Why don’t we get started
on this, all right?

206
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
- Sure.

207
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
- Come on.
Look at that.

208
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
What’s that?
Come on.

209
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Come on.

210
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Yes. Beautiful. Perfect.

211
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
- Simon, we’re going
to be late.

212
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Would you hurry?

213
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
- Yes, I’m coming.
All right.

214
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
- Come on.

215
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
- Morgana, my darling,
we’re wanted in court.

216
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
- Simon!

217
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
- You have to admit
that it would make
quite an entrance.

218
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
- The animal rights people
would have my hide.

219
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
- Better your hide
than a mink’s, dear.

220
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Those, I think.

221
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
In medieval times,
a falconer Manning
a new bird

222
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
would carry it with him
wherever he went,
even to church.

223
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
- We’re not going
to church.

224
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
- There are rumors
of falconers

225
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
bringing new birds
to the bedchamber...

226
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Hooded, of course.

227
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
- You’re not going to leave
this bird in here.

228
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I just had
the rug cleaned.

229
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
- No, not tonight,
darling.

230
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I’ll bring her
back to the mews

231
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
on my way
to the car.

232
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
- Would you please go
and get your tie fixed?

233
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
We’re going to be late
for my speech.

234
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
- Oh, yes. The speech.

235
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
- Yes.
How did you like it?

236
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
- Oh, it’s a corker.

237
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Inspiring, really.
It made me want to go
out and save the planet.

238
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
- How do you expect
to do that?

239
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
You can’t even
tie your tie.

240
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
- Plant a tree or two,
I suppose.

241
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
- Well, I’m glad
you liked it

242
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
because if it
goes well,

243
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
it’ll be
the springboard

244
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
for my senatorial
declaration.

245
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
- Oh, you’ve decided then.

246
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
- I think
it’s now or never.

247
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
- I still remember the day
you came into my classroom,

248
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
and I said,
"it’s Joan of arc."

249
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
- Why, did you think
I heard voices?

250
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,000
- No. I thought
you’d lead men into battle.

251
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
And so you will.

252
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
- Thank you.

253
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
- Oh, you’re
carrying high.

254
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
It’s a boy,
of course. Did you
do ultrasound?

255
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
- No, we decided to wait
to find out.

256
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
- Good for you!

257
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Back in my day,
we just took
our chances,

258
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
and I got what
I wanted every time.

259
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
- "She was a Gordian shape
of dazzling hue,

260
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
vermilion-spotted, golden,
green, and blue."

261
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
- Oh, thanks, dad.

262
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
- Hi, Lorna. I see
you’ve met my daughter.

263
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
- Yes. She’s
a treasure,

264
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
and I guarantee you
that’s a boy.

265
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
- How lovely.
You look beautiful.

266
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
- I feel like
a houseboat.

267
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
- Nonsense. You look
just as you should.

268
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
- Good evening. Simon.
- Ah, Charles.

269
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
- Charlie, guests...
Who’ve we got?

270
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
- So far, guest of honor,

271
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
we have got 17
from the house,

272
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
we got 4 senators
and a couple of movie stars,

273
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
and there’s
a news crew from CBS.

274
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
So I’d say
we’re batting .600
before the first speech.

275
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Let me take you around,
all right?

276
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
- Excuse me.

277
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
- Will you
look at her go?

278
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Like a salmon
up a waterfall.

279
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
- Charlie’s in heaven.
He lives for this.

280
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
- So does your mother.

281
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Guess you and I
are here for the ride.

282
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
- I like to think of
myself as the power
behind the throne.

283
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
- Personally,
I had more than my fill
of cutthroat politics

284
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
chairing the medieval studies
department.

285
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
- You miss teaching, dad?

286
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
- Well,
I miss my students,

287
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
but I’m plowing great swaths
through my new book.

288
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I certainly don’t miss
the faculty meetings.

289
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
May I get
you ladies a drink?

290
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
- Oh, yes.
A Martini, please.

291
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
- Phoebe, Shirley temple
for old time’s sake?

292
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
- Nothing.
- No? Be right back.

293
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
- We’ve heard
too much about the threat
of global warming.

294
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
We can’t afford
to distance ourselves

295
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
with the language like "threat."

296
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Something that may or
may not come to pass.

297
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Global warming is not a threat
but a crisis in progress.

298
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
The Chinese word for crisis

299
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
has two different
meanings in English.

300
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Danger and opportunity.

301
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Our earth is already in danger,

302
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
so we must seize
this opportunity

303
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
to change the behaviors that
cause and continue to cause

304
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,000
an environmental catastrophe
of global proportions.

305
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
The most urgent problem
facing us today

306
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
is convincing the public
that there is a problem.

307
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
But to those
who would say,

308
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
"we don’t have
all the facts yet,"

309
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I answer that
when you are hurtling

310
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
headlong
towards disaster,

311
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
you don’t take a poll,
you take action.

312
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
We’re condemning
this earth to the gallows,

313
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
and we must
mend our ways now

314
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
if we plan to get out
of this one alive.

315
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Thank you.

316
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Thank you.

317
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Thank you.

318
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000

- That’s beautiful.

324
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
You should go up there
and sing.

325
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
- Charlie, I’m all mingled out.
Can we go home?

326
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
- No, I’m serious. Why don’t
you go take a few numbers?

327
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
It’ll be perfect.

328
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
- Nobody wants to hear
somebody’s kid sing.

329
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
- I hate it
when you say that.

330
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
You’re not someone’s kid.
You’re a wonderful singer.

331
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
- I’m not going to
sing here.

332
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
- Come on. It’s brilliant.

333
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
This is Nell’s night,
you’re her daughter...

334
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
- She’d hate it.

335
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
- You’re out of your mind.
She’d be crazy about it.
I’ll tell that pianist...

336
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
- No! I said...
- What’s the matter?

337
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
- Will you stop?

338
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
You don’t know
how to stop!

339
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
- I’m sorry. Excuse me.

340
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Phoebe?

341
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Phoebe?

342
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
- Yes, mom.

343
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
- Honey, are you all right?
Are you sick?

344
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Should I call someone?

345
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
- I’m fine.

346
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
- You don’t sound
fine to me.

347
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
- I’m tired.

348
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I’ve been here
for hours,

349
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
and if
one more woman
touches my belly,

350
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I’m going to deck her.

351
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
- Honey, you’ve been
feeling tired
quite a bit lately.

352
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
That’s not right.
Maybe you should go
to the doctor again.

353
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
- I’ve been on my feet
for hours.

354
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I’m seven months pregnant.

355
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
- I guess I was just lucky
to feel terrific
right to the end.

356
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
The day before
you were born,

357
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I argued a case before...

358
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
The supreme court.
- The supreme court.

359
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
- I won it, too,
and I was back
on the job...

360
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Six days later. Right.
- Six days later. Yes, I know.

361
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
- Hi, Charlie.
- Hey.

362
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Are you all right?

363
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
- Nobody else
seems to thinks so.

364
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
- Oh, honey...
- I think so.

365
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I think you are
stupendous.

366
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
- Call me a cab.

367
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
- Sweetie...
- Mother, I’m fine.

368
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I’m fine. Good night.

369
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,000
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

370
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
- She’s going to be fine.
I’ll take her home.

371
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Enjoy yourself.
- O.K. You were great.

372
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
- No, you were great.
You were a hit.

373
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Good-bye. I’ll talk
to you tomorrow.

374
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
- Bye-bye.

375
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Ohh...hi, Terry.
Good to see you.

376
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
- Here. Don’t want you
to catch cold.

377
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
- You know, Charlie,
you really don’t
have to leave yet.

378
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I can take a cab.

379
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
- No way. I’m staying
with you.

380
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
- I’m really all right.

381
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
- I believe you, but
I’m wrapped here.

382
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
There’s nothing left
but the mop-up.

383
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I got to get home anyway.
I’ve got work to do.

384
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
- Tonight?
- Yeah. Why not?

385
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Tonight went
like clockwork.

386
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I feel like
a million bucks.

387
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
[Tires screech]

388
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Who taught this
moron to drive?

389
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Save the stunts
for the speedway, all right?

390
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
- Thank you.

391
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
- A triumph, I’d call it...

392
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Your speech in particular.

393
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
- I was preaching
to the converted.

394
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
- No, no no, Charlie told me
it raised a great deal of money.

395
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Wiped up, I believe
was his phrase.

396
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
- Did you talk to Phoebe
this evening?

397
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
- Yes. I had a perfectly
lovely chat with her
about my new book.

398
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
- How did she
seem to you?

399
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
- She seemed fine.

400
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Well, she’s never
been particularly fond
of these galas.

401
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
They’re more Charlie’s
meat, but...

402
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
- You were right
about the earrings.

403
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I got several
compliments.

404
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
- I’m usually right.
- You used to say always.

405
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
- I’m older and wiser now.

406
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I’m hedging my bets.

407
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
- [Laughs]

408
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Ahh.

409
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
[Sighs]

410
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
- You know what
struck me tonight

411
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
as I looked at Phoebe?

412
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
It was the flush
of dynastic pride.

413
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
My daughter
about to give birth
to my grandchild.

414
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Oh, there’s no other
way to describe it.

415
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
It felt miraculous.

416
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
- You’ll be a spectacular
grandfather, daddy.

417
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
[Telephone rings]

418
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
- Oh...sake.
It’s 1:00 in the morning.

419
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
- Hello?

420
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
What?

421
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Where?

422
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
- Ma’am, you can see
I have my hands full here.

423
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
- Tell me something.

424
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
My son-in-law
and my daughter...

425
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
- I’ll be with you
as soon as I can.

426
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
- Just tell me
they’re still alive!

427
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
- Yes, Nell,
they are. They are.

428
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
- How did you get here?

429
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
- I’ve got a friend
who works in the E.R.

430
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
He called me.
I got here as soon
as I could.

431
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
- What happened?
- Their car hit a wall.

432
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Phoebe’s not
badly hurt.

433
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
She’s got
whiplash and
a few bruises,

434
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
but they’re afraid
she might miscarry.

435
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
They’ve hooked her up
to a fetal monitor.

436
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
- Representative
Harrington?

437
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
- Just a minute.
What happened to Charlie?

438
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
- They don’t know
the extent of the injuries.

439
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
- Somebody must know
something!

440
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
- Excuse me, ma’am.
Lieutenant Grody,
metropolitan police.

441
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I’m investigating
your son-in-law’s
accident.

442
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
- How badly hurt is he,
lieutenant?

443
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
- Apparently, he
went right through
the windshield.

444
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
- The ambulance squad said he
never regained consciousness.

445
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
They took him
right into surgery.

446
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
- But what happened?

447
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
It’s my press secretary.
Just tell me, please.

448
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
- He took a skid
down an off-ramp

449
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
and ran head-on into
a retaining wall.

450
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
The road was slick.
There was a chance
he was speeding.

451
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I’m sorry to tell
you this, ma’am,

452
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
but my unit checked
out the scene,

453
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
and we found
some narcotics.

454
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
- You mean they were hit
by some crazy, drugged-out...

455
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
- No, ma’am. There were
no other vehicles.

456
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
The narcotics were
found in his pocket.

457
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
- What?
- Whose pocket?

458
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
- Mr. Ryan’s.

459
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
- That’s not possible.

460
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
- I’m sorry.
We sent the evidence

461
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
down to the lab
for analysis,

462
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
but it looks like
we’re talking a couple
grams of cocaine.

463
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
- No. There must be
some kind of mistake.

464
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
- No mistake, ma’am.
I found it myself.

465
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
We’re still checking,
but he’s probably
facing charges

466
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
of illegal possession,
DUI, and reckless
endangerment.

467
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
- I don’t believe this.

468
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
- Let’s wait until
we get the blood tests.

469
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I’ll keep you informed.

470
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
- Good lord.

471
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
- I don’t believe it.

472
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
- Look, Nell, we’re
going to have to keep
this out of the press.

473
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
You going
to be all right?

474
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
- Nell, you all right?

475
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
- No, I’m fine.
I’m fine. I’m fine.

476
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
- O.K.

477
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
- It’s been two hours.

478
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
- I haven’t wanted
a cigarette in 15 years.

479
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
- Sit down for a minute.
You’ll wear yourself out.

480
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
- How could Charlie
do something so stupid?

481
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I could just throttle him.

482
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
The press is gonna love this.

483
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
So much for running
for the senate.

484
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
- We better see Phoebe.

485
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
- How can he do that
to her and to the baby?

486
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
- Nell, stop it.

487
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
- I just hate being helpless.

488
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,000
- I just hate it!
- Come on. Sit down. Please.

489
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
- Oh, Simon. I hope
they’re all right.

490
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
- Come on.

491
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:23,000
- I was so happy when
they first started dating.

492
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
The two of them getting
together, you know?

493
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
- Mr. and Mrs. Harrington?

494
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
- Yes?

495
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
- You can see your daughter now.

496
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
- Phoebe, your parents
are here.

497
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Please try not
to get her excited.

498
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
- Hi, darling.

499
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
- Charlie...have you seen him?

500
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
No one’s
telling me anything.

501
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
- He’s still in surgery.
We don’t know anything.

502
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
- They’re lying.
They have to know
something.

503
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
- Don’t get worked up now.
It’s bad for the baby.

504
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
- They have to know something.

505
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
- I’ll go and find out.
I’ll come right back.

506
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I promise, o.K.?
Just relax.

507
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
- Darling, they’re doing
the best they can, I’m sure.

508
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Charlie’s in good hands.

509
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Everything’s going to
be all right.

510
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
- We have been here
for hours,

511
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,000
and no one has
given us one piece of
straight information.

512
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
- Ma’am, I’m sorry.

513
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
- Nell.

514
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
How’s Charlie?

515
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
- It appears to be
a state secret.

516
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
- Look,
we need to talk.

517
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Over here.

518
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
- What?

519
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
- Just sit.

520
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
It’s not good.

521
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
The media
picked up the story.

522
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Has anybody been in
here to talk to you?

523
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
- Reporters? No.

524
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
- Good. Let’s keep it
that way.

525
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
- If Charlie is really
involved in drugs,

526
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I’m not going to
whitewash it for him.

527
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
- Nobody is talking
about a whitewash,

528
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
but he’s the head
of your staff and
your son-in-law.

529
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
- We’ll take it head-on.

530
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I’ll call a press conference,

531
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
and then we’ll just come
forward with it ourselves.

532
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Maybe somebody will
respect our honesty.

533
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
God knows I’m going to
need as much help...

534
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
- Why don’t we
just sit tight

535
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
until we’ve got
all the facts?

536
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
- Mrs. Harrington?

537
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
I’m Dr. Strathwood.

538
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
I operated on
your son-in-law.

539
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
- Oh, no.

540
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
- I’m sorry.

541
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,000
- No. Charlie.

542
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Oh, Charlie.

543
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
- Nell, can I, uh...

544
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
- Damn you, Charlie!

545
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
What a waste!

546
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
I can’t stand this.

547
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
- Where is she?

548
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
- Simon!

549
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,000
- I’m right here, my love.
- He’s gone! He’s gone.

550
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Charlie’s gone.
- I know.

551
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
- I loved him so much.
- I know it.

552
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,000
- What were the results
of the drug tests?

553
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
- I’m afraid
they were positive.

554
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
- Well...

555
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
There it is.

556
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
- How are we going
to tell Phoebe?

557
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
- Let’s tell her that he...

558
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Just got out of surgery.

559
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Maybe by tomorrow...

560
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
- He’s not...

561
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Get away from me.

562
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
No, it’s not true.

563
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
No, is it?

564
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
He’s not dead.
He can’t be.

565
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
No! My god, no!

566
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Charlie, please!

567
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Let me get
to my husband, please!

568
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Charlie, please!

569
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
God, no!

570
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Oh, no, daddy, no!

571
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:26,000
- Charlie Ryan worked
on my staff for nine years.

572
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,000
He’s been my administrative
assistant for four years.

573
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Last year, he married
my daughter.

574
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
I’d hoped to be able
to stand here today

575
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
and deny allegations,

576
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
but I will not lie
to the public.

577
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Hospital blood tests confirmed
that Charlie, my...

578
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:57,000
My beloved son-in-law Charlie,

579
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
was, in fact, using cocaine

580
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
at the time of the accident.

581
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,000
I know now what every parent
must feel

582
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
in this circumstance.

583
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
"How could this happen?"

584
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,000
"How could I be unaware
this was happening?"

585
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
[Cameras whir]

586
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:31,000
I will never accept
Charlie’s death,

587
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,000
and I will never
stop missing him,

588
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:39,000
and I will never assume,
as I did...

589
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,000
That drug abuse is a problem

590
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
that happens to somebody else.

591
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Nobody is safe.

592
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Nobody...

593
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
I...

594
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
- How will this impact your work
in the area of drug abuse?

595
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
- Perhaps you shouldn’t
proceed if...

596
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:13,000
- I will continue to fight
for anti-drug legislation

597
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,000
and particularly
for drug education.

598
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
- What is your daughter’s
condition?

599
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,000
- Mrs. Ryan’s condition
at this point is stable,

600
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
as is the fetus’.

601
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
We don’t expect complications.

602
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
- Representative Harrington,
you’ve had a terrible shock,

603
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
and you have my condolences.

604
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,000
In your statement, you claimed
that you had no awareness at all

605
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
that your top aide,
a man you saw daily

606
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
and under high pressure
for nine years,

607
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
might be using cocaine
on the job.

608
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
- That is correct.

609
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,000
- Might it not be possible
that you would also be unaware

610
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
of cocaine usage by his wife?

611
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,000
- My daughter
is 7 months pregnant.

612
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:59,000
- Isn’t it possible that she
might also be using cocaine?

613
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
- Absolutely not!

614
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
- Mrs. Ryan’s blood and urine
were tested for drugs

615
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
as a matter of hospital policy.

616
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Both tests came back negative.

617
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
- There’s no story there.

618
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:22,000
- Look, I’m not gonna be able
to make it till 5:00.

619
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
- Representative Harrington’s
office.

620
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
No. I’m sorry. She’s not
in the office at this time.

621
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
- Nell, what are you
doing here?

622
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
We didn’t expect
you in so soon.

623
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,000
- Life has to
go on somehow,
doesn’t it?

624
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
- Full-court press
on the educa...

625
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
- He should be here.

626
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
This isn’t right.

627
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
- No, it’s not right.

628
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Nothing about this
is right.

629
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
What’s
the response been?

630
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
- Mixed.

631
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Not what
we hoped for.

632
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,000
So far, only about
40% of the calls
have been positive.

633
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,000
So much for
respecting honesty.

634
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
- Listen...

635
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
You all worked
with Charlie.

636
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Who knew he was on drugs?

637
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
You know each other.

638
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,000
You go out together.

639
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Where was he getting cocaine?

640
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
How much was he using?

641
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Why didn’t somebody tell me?

642
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
- I didn’t know.

643
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
- If I ever find out
that one of you did know

644
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
and you didn’t have
the courage to face me,

645
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
I’ll not only fire you,
I’ll make sure you never
work on the hill again!

646
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,000
I don’t want any more secrets.
I’ll be at the hospital.

647
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,000
- Dr. Adams, Dr. Adams,

648
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
please contact Dr. Margolis.

649
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
- Mom.

650
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Mom.

651
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,000
- What? Hmm?

652
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
- How long have you
been there?

653
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:41,000
- Oh, a couple
of hours.

654
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Did you get
some sleep?

655
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
- Yecch...

656
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
I had horrible dreams.

657
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,000
- So did I.

658
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
- I just want to wake up
and have this all be over.

659
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,000
- Did you know that...

660
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Charlie was
using cocaine?

661
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Did you?

662
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
- What?

663
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
- Charlie was
using cocaine

664
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
when the accident
happened.

665
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
- I can’t believe
you would think that.

666
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
There’s got to be a mistake.

667
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
- He had drugs
in his bloodstream.

668
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Sweetie, what have
I told you ever since
you were a little girl?

669
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
You can tell me anything
as long as...

670
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
It’s true.
- It’s true.

671
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,000
- Why in the hell
didn’t you tell me

672
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
while we could still
do something?

673
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
You’re not using
anything, are you?

674
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,000
- No, I’m not on drugs,
mother.

675
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,000
I haven’t had so much
as a glass of wine

676
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
since the day I found out
I was pregnant.

677
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
You know that.

678
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,000
- I don’t know
anything anymore.

679
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Who would have
thought Charlie

680
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
would do something
so stupid?

681
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
- You don’t know
you’re right about that one.

682
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
- I do know
you tried pot

683
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
when you were
a teenager.

684
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
- Mom...i was born
in the sixties.

685
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Everybody my age
has tried something,

686
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
unless they grew up
in a convent.

687
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
- No they haven’t.

688
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
- It’s like asking someone
from your generation

689
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
if they’ve ever
had a cocktail.

690
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,000
- No, it’s not,
and you know it!

691
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Don’t try to pretend
this is normal.

692
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Your husband
is dead,

693
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
and I want to know
why it happened.

694
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
- I want to know
why it happened.

695
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
I tried to get him to stop.

696
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:51,000
At first it was just
something to do for fun,

697
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,000
something to do at a party,
like having a beer,

698
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
and then it just
got out of hand.

699
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
He’d promise he’d cut back,

700
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
and then he’d sneak out
and buy something.

701
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,000
I...i was worried about him...

702
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,000
But what could I do? I...

703
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
I tried everything,
but what could I do?

704
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Oh, god.

705
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Oh, mom!

706
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
- Shh.

707
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
- Oh, god! Oh, mom...

708
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
- Oh, sweetie...

709
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
- Oh, god!

710
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:35,000
I miss him so much,
I don’t think
I can stand this.

711
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Oh, god.

712
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,000
- But you did speak
to the doctor?

713
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,000
- Yes. He said
everything is still
fine with the baby.

714
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Maybe Phoebe could
come home tomorrow.

715
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,000
- Oh, but she can’t
go back to their place.

716
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Let’s bring her here.

717
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:01,000
- I think it would
do us all good to get
out of Washington.

718
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Maybe when we get
through with the...

719
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Funeral service...

720
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
I could take
some time off.

721
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Let’s just take Phoebe
up to the lake

722
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
and stay a while.

723
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,000
- What about your plans
to announce for the senate?

724
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,000
- Guess that’ll have
to wait for a while.

725
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
[Screeching]

726
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
- Ohh! Ooh!

727
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
[Screeching]

728
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Oh, they’re beautiful.
Isn’t she something?

729
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
- She’s great, dad.

730
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
[Vehicle approaching]

731
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,000
- We picked up some sweet
Cologne at Fesco’s stand.

732
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Do you know they
still have a shoebox for cash

733
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:37,000
and a sign that says "out
fishing. Take your own change"?

734
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Try that in Washington.

735
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,000
- Right. Hi, dear.
Did you have fun?

736
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
- Yeah, it was fun.

737
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,000
- Was she like that
the whole time?

738
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
- Well, at least she
came out of her room.

739
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Morgana, come on, my lady.

740
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Would you talk to me instead
of the bird for a change?

741
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,000
- Oh, Nell, for heaven’s sake.

742
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,000
- Well, she won’t eat,
she won’t speak,

743
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
and the baby is due in a month.

744
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
I don’t know how she’s
going to take care of it.

745
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
I don’t know what to do.

746
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,000
- And what wound did ever
heal but by degrees?

747
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,000
- Oh, stop.

748
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,000
- Has he caught any fish?

749
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
- Not for 10 years.

750
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
- [Laughing]
Well...

751
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
We won’t starve.

752
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Butter and sugar
from Fesco’s...

753
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,000
A national treasure,
or it should be, anyway.

754
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,000
If I had a nickel
for every ear of corn

755
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
I have shucked
on this dock...

756
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
- You’d buy me
the moon.

757
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
- Is that what
I used to say?

758
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
- All the time.

759
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,000
- Well, that was
fairly pretentious
of me, wasn’t it?

760
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Oh, honey...

761
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
What can I do
to help you?

762
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
- Nothing.

763
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,000
I open my eyes
in the morning,

764
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
and there’s
nobody there.

765
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
- I know it seems
like that now,

766
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
but when
the baby comes...

767
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
- Oh, mother, please don’t
tell me how lucky I am
to have this baby.

768
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
I want my husband.
- I know you do.

769
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
- He was the one who
wanted this baby.

770
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
I did this for him.
I’m not ready for this.

771
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
I don’t want to
do this alone.

772
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
- You’re not going to
be alone.

773
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
- Yes, I will.

774
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:39,000
I loved him more
than I loved myself.

775
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
- Honey...

776
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
- Mother, please
don’t tell me you
know how I feel,

777
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
because you don’t.

778
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:50,000
- Phoebe, I may not know
the right thing to say,

779
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
but I am trying.

780
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
- I know.

781
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
I know.

782
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Nothing helps.

783
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
[Clock chiming]

784
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
- Simon, why don’t
you just hand me
that plate?

785
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
I’ll wrap it up.

786
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Maybe she’ll have it for
a midnight snack or something.

787
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
- There you go.
- Thank you.

788
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
- Mom?

789
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
- Hmm? What?

790
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
- Uhh...

791
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,000
- Oh, my god. What’s the matter?
What happened? Oh, honey.

792
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
- Oh...oh...

793
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
- We’ve got to get her
to the hospital.
Can you get her?

794
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
- Here you go. Yeah.
Here we go. Come on.

795
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
- I’ll go get a robe
and some towels.

796
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Get her out there
as quickly as possible.

797
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
- Uhh!

798
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
- Ok, there’s the head.

799
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
- I can’t.
- Heart rate’s dropped to 94.

800
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:32,000
- Push!
You can do it, baby! Push!

801
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
[Indistinct]

802
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
You’ve got to help us out now!

803
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
- Ok. I’m trying.

804
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
- We just need you to focus,
once more, o.K.?

805
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Really push his head, o.K.?

806
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
O.K. Here it comes.

807
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,000
- And push!

808
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Good girl.

809
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Almost.

810
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Yes! There it is!

811
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Hold it! Hold it.
Hold it....

812
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,000
O.K., one more time...
And push!

813
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Push! Push!

814
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
- Aah!

815
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
- We got it. We got it.

816
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,000
All right...
Suction her out.
Let’s bag her.

817
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
- What?

818
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
- I’m going to just
give her some oxygen.

819
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
- Extremities
are still blue.
Heart rate’s 90.

820
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
- Got it.
- What are you doing?

821
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
- No need to panic.

822
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
- She’s getting pink.
Heart rate’s up.

823
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
- What’s going on?

824
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
- It’s o.K. She’s
starting to respond.

825
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
- Showing signs
of reflex.

826
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
- Good. I.D. Her
and get her to ICN.

827
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
It’s a girl.

828
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
- She looks so...

829
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Unfinished.

830
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:54,000
- Why, she...She’s
trying to cry.

831
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Oh, I wish they
could take those
tubes out of her.

832
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,000
- She just
looks so tiny.

833
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,000
- Well, she...She
is a month early.

834
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
- Even so.

835
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:11,000
I’m going to go and
find phoebe’s doctor.

836
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
- Nell?

837
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,000
- Dr. Charbonneau?
Excuse me.

838
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
- Oh. Hi,
Mrs. Harrington.

839
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Have you seen your
granddaughter yet?

840
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
- Yes, I did.
Could I ask you a few
questions, please?

841
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
I’m in the middle
of rounds...

842
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,000
- Could you just tell me,
why was she born premature?

843
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
- Well, it could
be nutrition,

844
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,000
hormonal imbalances,
overexertion.

845
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,000
In phoebe’s case,
stress is a likely factor.

846
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
- What about drugs?

847
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,000
- If the mother
were using narcotics,

848
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
then yes, absolutely,

849
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
drugs would
be a factor.

850
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Does Phoebe use drugs?

851
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
- I don’t know.

852
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
- Then you better
ask her.

853
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
- Her husband was killed
in a car crash.

854
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
He was using cocaine,

855
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,000
but phoebe’s blood test
came back negative.

856
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,000
- Cocaine can be out
of the bloodstream
in 48 hours.

857
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
All that would prove
is she hadn’t been
high for two days

858
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
when
they tested her.

859
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
- Aren’t there some tests
you can do on the baby

860
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
and on Phoebe
that would...

861
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
- Yes. Yes, there are.

862
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
If we administer them

863
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
and either
tests positive,

864
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
the mother could
lose the baby
to foster care.

865
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
She could also
be prosecuted

866
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
for carrying
drugs to a minor
or child abuse.

867
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,000
- Are you saying
I shouldn’t pursue this?

868
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,000
- I’m telling
you things that can happen.

869
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
- Oh...

870
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
- I read the papers.
I know what you’ve
been going through.

871
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
- I appreciate that.

872
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
- I voted for you.

873
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
I like your positions
on health care.

874
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Now if you’ll
excuse me,

875
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
I have to deliver
some twins.

876
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
- Dr. Charbonneau,
you’ve seen that baby.

877
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Do you think it’s possible
she was drug-affected?

878
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,000
- Yes. It is possible.

879
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
- Oh...

880
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Hey.

881
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Well, I’m glad
to see you up and around.

882
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
- Just went
down the hall.

883
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
- To get a soda?

884
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,000
- I was thirsty.

885
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
- I see.

886
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Have you seen
the baby yet?

887
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
- Mom...

888
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
- Have you?

889
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,000
- It’s the first time
I’ve been on my feet.

890
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
- And you went
for a soda?

891
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
- I don’t want to see it,
all right?

892
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,000
- Why, because you’re
afraid to see the
cocaine you took?

893
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
- Who said I took cocaine?

894
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
- Don’t lie to me, Phoebe.
I know what you did.

895
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
- Mother, please.

896
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
- Do you know she’s
in critical condition
because of you!

897
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
- Just listen to what I...

898
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
- How could you do that
to your baby? How could you?

899
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:04,000
- I hurt, mom.
My husband’s dead.

900
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,000
I had to do something
to make the pain stop.

901
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:10,000
- You think you’re
the only person in pain
because of Charlie?

902
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
I loved him like a son!

903
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,000
- Tell me about it.

904
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:16,000
You two were so tight,
I felt like the in-law.

905
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,000
- That is no excuse
for what you did.

906
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
You did not have
to take drugs!

907
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
- Well, I did.
- Why?

908
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
- Because it’s what I know.

909
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
- Did you
get him started?

910
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
- I knew it.

911
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
I knew you’d blame me
for Charlie.

912
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,000
- Answer my question!
Did you or didn’t you?

913
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,000
- No, I didn’t!
Charlie got me high...

914
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Our first date together.

915
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,000
I’d been straight
for three years.

916
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
I tried, mom.

917
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
I tried to stay clean.

918
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,000
You don’t know
how hard I tried.

919
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,000
- Three years?
- Exactly.

920
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
- You mean all
this time she’s...

921
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
And I thought
this was all over

922
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
with that business
in high school.

923
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
- So did I.

924
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
She’s certainly not going
to tell us the truth,

925
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,000
that’s for sure.

926
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,000
- If we hadn’t sent her to
that boarding school...

927
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
- Oh! Well, hindsight
is brilliant.

928
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
We thought it would help.

929
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
- No, no. You thought
it would help.

930
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:49,000
- We both did! You agreed.
- I knuckled under.

931
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
- You said, and I quote,

932
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:56,000
"maybe she’ll actually
learn something in a more
structured environment."

933
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
- Ha ha!

934
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Well, obviously she did.

935
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,000
She learned how
to lie better.

936
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,000
- How did we miss it?

937
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
- Well, maybe we...

938
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
We were both too busy.

939
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:15,000
- I spent every
spare minute with her.

940
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
You were off
on a sabbatical

941
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
and I was down
in Washington...

942
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:22,000
- Exactly. We weren’t there.
- Now, wait a minute.

943
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,000
I’m not going to be
made to feel guilty
because I loved my work.

944
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,000
That didn’t mean
I loved Phoebe any less.

945
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:33,000
- I’m not saying you
loved her less, but...

946
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Maybe we shouldn’t
have had a child.

947
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
- Well, we did...

948
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
And so did Phoebe.

949
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,000
- Oh, I’m sorry.

950
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:02,000
I thought this was
my daughter’s room.

951
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
- That’s all right.

952
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
- Oh, it is her room.

953
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Phoebe?

954
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Phoebe?

955
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:16,000
- Mrs. Harrington?
I called you at home.

956
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Your husband said
you were already
on your way.

957
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
- Well, where’s Phoebe?
- She left.

958
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
- What?

959
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
- Apparently,
she just walked out
of the hospital.

960
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
Nobody saw her leave.

961
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
- Oh, now, wait.
Wait a minute.

962
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:32,000
You mean Phoebe walked
out of the hospital
with the baby?

963
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,000
- The baby is still
in intensive care.

964
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
- Oh, no.

965
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
Oh...

966
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
- I have to ask you
an important question.

967
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:44,000
If you can’t
locate Phoebe

968
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
or if she’s
in no fit condition,

969
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
are you prepared
to take custody of
your granddaughter?

970
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,000
- Well...yes, of course.

971
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
- You might want some time
to consider.

972
00:48:55,000 --> 00:49:01,000
- Well...yes. The answer is yes.

973
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
- She’s not critical anymore.

974
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
She is starting
to breathe better.

975
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
Probably she’ll be off
the oxygen in a day or so.

976
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,000
- How long will she have
to stay in the hospital?

977
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
- A week, maybe two.

978
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
- Is that all?

979
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
- Depends on how well
she takes to the bottle.

980
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,000
- She’s only a month premature.

981
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
That’s a big girl for this ward.

982
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:30,000
If we get her eating,
she’s ready to roll.

983
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
Do you want to hold her?

984
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,000
- Well...what about
all the tubes and things?

985
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
- It’s all right. We handle
them all the time.

986
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,000
Hello there, darlin’.

987
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
[Baby fussing]

988
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Good girl.

989
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:59,000
[Baby crying]

990
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:05,000
- Ohh. Ohh. Hey.

991
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
It’s o.K.

992
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:10,000
So...ohh, ohh.

993
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Ohh. It’s all right.

994
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:17,000
It’s all right.
It’s all right.

995
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
- Simon, you’re nervous.

996
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
- Well, sure.
Of course I am.

997
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:32,000
I haven’t seen her
since the day she was born.

998
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,000
- I’m nervous, too.

999
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
- Mrs. Harrington.

1000
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,000
It’s good to
see you again.

1001
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,000
- Oh, hi.

1002
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
- Mr. Harrington?
Margo charbonneau.

1003
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,000
- Oh, how do you do?

1004
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,000
- Hi. So, today’s
the big day.

1005
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
You all ready?

1006
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
- Not really, but...

1007
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,000
- Here she is.

1008
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
- Ohh.

1009
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,000
- Hello, sweetie.

1010
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:02,000
Hello, sweetie. Hello.

1011
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
Oh, oh,
goodness, yes.

1012
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:07,000
Do you want to go
and see grandpa?

1013
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,000
Here you go.

1014
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
[Baby cries]

1015
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,000
Ohh.

1016
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
Oh, she’ll get
used to you, Simon.

1017
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Yes, she did that to me
at first, too.

1018
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:22,000
- She’s starting
to recognize you
from the feedings.

1019
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:26,000
- Yeah. Did you have
your bottle without
grandma this morning?

1020
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,000
- No coughing,
no spit-up. A-plus.

1021
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,000
- Are you going to help
with the feedings?

1022
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
- Oh! Well...

1023
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Yes, probably.

1024
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,000
- Be patient. It’s harder
with babies who’ve been
on a feeding tube.

1025
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,000
They tend to resist
the nipple.

1026
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
- Are there likely to
be other problems?

1027
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
- It’s hard to predict,

1028
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
especially without being
able to ask her mother

1029
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
exactly what she was
exposed to in utero.

1030
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,000
- What if it was cocaine?

1031
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
- There’s no safe amount
you can take when
you’re pregnant.

1032
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:57,000
The damage depends
on how much, how often,

1033
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
how far along
was the fetus,

1034
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
and if Phoebe
was combining it
with other drugs...

1035
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
Especially alcohol.

1036
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
Her baby could face
some serious problems.

1037
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
- What can we do
about it?

1038
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
- Be good parents.

1039
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:13,000
Environment will make
all the difference.

1040
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:16,000
- I still don’t feel
right about closing the house.

1041
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
- Aw, honey, she’s not here.

01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
- We’ll have to discuss it,
but thanks. Thanks very much.

1215
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
- There are hundreds
of thousands

1216
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
of mothers
with drug problems.

1217
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
Where do these women go?

1218
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
- Nell, tell me something.

1219
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
Is this something she wants,
or is this what you want?

1220
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:03,000
- This is what
Phoebe needs.

1221
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
- No. That’s not
what I’m asking.

1222
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
- Do you have
another solution?

1223
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:10,000
We have to do something.

1224
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:13,000
- Well, I found one.
- What?

1225
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:16,000
- It’s a residential recovery
program called family house.

1226
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
They take pregnant women,
mothers with children.

1227
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
They have only 14 beds,

1228
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
and there’s a waiting list
up to six months.

1229
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
Well...here.

1230
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:33,000
Yes, this is representative
Nell Harrington.

1231
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
Well, this looks like
a pretty old house.

1232
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:40,000
- What difference
does that make?

1233
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
- You’re going to be here
for six or eight months...

1234
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:45,000
- I said I’d talk to them.
That’s all I said.

1235
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:48,000
- Hello. Hi.
I’m Nell Harrington.

1236
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
My daughter, Phoebe Ryan.

1237
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:53,000
- Hi. Holly Ellis.
I’m the administrative
director here,

1238
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
and this is my assistant,
Lucinda.

1239
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
She does my job
and everybody else’s
around here.

1240
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:00,000
- Hi. Lucinda bernardi,
head of clinical staff.

1241
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
Hi, Phoebe. Can I get
you a cup of coffee
or something?

1242
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
- Not for me. Darling?

1243
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:07,000
- Let’s go up
to my office.

1244
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
- Poor baby.

1245
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
- What we can do is set up
an appointment with a doctor.

1246
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
- She started using cocaine

1247
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:23,000
when Charlie, her husband,
was killed.

1248
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:29,000
- How long
had you been taking drugs
before you got pregnant?

1249
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,000
- Since high school.

1250
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
- Periodically.
- Most of the time.

1251
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
- Don’t exaggerate.
- Fine.

1252
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
- Look,
there’s no judgment here.

1253
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
There isn’t
a right or wrong answer.

1254
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
Is this your
first pregnancy?

1255
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
- Yes.

1256
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:48,000
- Why don’t we let
Phoebe answer, all right?

1257
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:54,000
- Phoebe?

1258
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:55,000
- She already
told you.

1259
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:58,000
- Excuse me.

1260
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
Lucinda,
would you come up to
my office, please?

1261
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:05,000
Thank you.

1262
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:11,000
Would you leave us
alone for a while?

1263
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
- But I thought...

1264
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
- I’d like to talk to you
one at a time.

1265
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:18,000
Lucinda will give you
the not-so-grand tour,

1266
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:21,000
and we’ll
ask you to fill out
a family questionnaire.

1267
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
Just some background,
all right?

1268
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
- Certainly. Be glad to.

1269
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:26,000
[Knock on door]

1270
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
- Yes?

1271
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
- Lucinda, would you
give Mrs. Harrington
the tour, please?

1272
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
- Sure.

1273
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
- Uh, thank you.

1274
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:51,000
- Phoebe, what are
you doing here?

1275
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
- What?
- Why did you come here?

1276
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
- I already told you.

1277
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:58,000
- No, your mother did.
I’d like to hear it
from you.

1278
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
- I want to take care
of my baby.

1279
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,000
- But what about you?

1280
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:07,000
Phoebe, you’re not
going to make it here

1281
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
if you come here
for your baby
or for your mother.

1282
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:12,000
They’re not on drugs.
You are.

1283
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:15,000
But you have got
to want to get off.

1284
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:21,000
Tell me, do you want
to get straight?

1285
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:22,000
- Yes.

1286
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:25,000
[Telephone ringing]

1287
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
Phone call.

1288
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
I don’t know.

1289
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
- All right, then.

1290
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:45,000
Now we’re
getting somewhere.

1291
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:46,000
- Hi, Judy.
- Hi.

1292
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:49,000
- Hi, Jordan.
- Come on, honey.

1293
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
- Hello.

1294
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
- We always put
the new residents

1295
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:56,000
in with someone we like
to call a mother peer.

1296
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:59,000
Someone who’s been on the
program for several months.

1297
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
And if the mother
already has a child,

1298
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:04,000
they’re able to be
in here with them.

1299
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:08,000
- Phoebe, whatever you did
that you think was so awful

1300
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
that you can’t
forgive yourself for,

1301
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:15,000
you’re going to hear
the same story from
everyone here.

1302
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:16,000
It’s like living
with mirrors.

1303
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:22,000
- And the residents provide
a lot of the emotional
support system.

1304
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
They all talk.

1305
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:27,000
They learn a lot
from each other.

1306
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
- [Sighs]

1307
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:34,000
- Are you all right?

1308
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
- Yeah. Yeah.

1309
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:41,000
I think I’m going to
go back downstairs now.

1310
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:47,000
- I don’t see what good it does
going over all this.

1311
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:50,000
- Because you have to look
at what really happened

1312
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
without judging
everything you did.

1313
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
- Look, it’s not my fault
if you don’t believe me.

1314
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
I mean, what do you
want me to do?

1315
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
- Drop your guilt.
- I already told you...

1316
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
- What you think
I wanted to hear.

1317
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
Look, I am not here
to beat you up,

1318
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:05,000
judge you,
or put you down.

1319
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:08,000
You do that all
right by yourself.
Am I right?

1320
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
- Well, obviously.
I fed drugs to my baby.

1321
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
- Yeah.
Uh-huh. You did.

1322
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
So?

1323
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
- I also took drugs
before Charlie died.

1324
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:21,000
If I’d known he’d had
some drugs left the night
of the accident,

1325
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:26,000
I probably would’ve
spent the whole night
trying to get it.

1326
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:30,000
I was totally
straight for the first
four months, though.

1327
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
Really.
I didn’t use once.

1328
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:33,000
- I believe you.

1329
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:36,000
- Yeah, I didn’t think
I’d get through that.

1330
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:41,000
I had cravings so bad.

1331
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
I was grinding my teeth...

1332
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:45,000
And sweats and...

1333
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
Stomach cramps,
nightmares.

1334
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:51,000
Then I ran into
a friend and...And...

1335
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:54,000
He had some pot,
and I smoked it...

1336
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:58,000
And I got started,
and I couldn’t stop.

1337
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
I lied to Charlie.

1338
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:12,000
I...i...i...

1339
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
I lied to everyone.

1340
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:24,000
I ran away from my baby.

1341
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
- So what does that
make you?

1342
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
- I wish I were dead.

1343
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:35,000
- Well, honey, you’re not.

1344
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
You’re a drug addict.

1345
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
Now, that doesn’t
mean that you’re
a bad person.

1346
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:46,000
That means that
you’re a sick person.

1347
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:51,000
You have an
addictive disease.

1348
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
Now, what we do here

1349
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
is show you the steps
towards recovery,

1350
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:58,000
but no one can take
those steps for you.

1351
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
We’re done.

1352
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:10,000
- Will you take her?

1353
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:14,000
- I think Phoebe
belongs in a setting
like this,

1354
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
but I am in
an awkward position.

1355
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
Two of our clients
graduate on Monday,

1356
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:21,000
so I have
two beds free.

1357
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
But I also have women
lined up on the street.

1358
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:27,000
Now, how do I justify
putting your daughter
ahead of them?

1359
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
- Mrs. Ellis, if you
would take Phoebe,

1360
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:32,000
I will pay
for both beds...

1361
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
Plus the next woman down
on your waiting list.

1362
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
Will you take her?

1363
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:41,000
- Well, you just may have
saved some lives.

1364
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:44,000
- Good.

1365
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:47,000
- We’ll put Phoebe straight
into hospital detox,

1366
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
probably not more
than two or three days.

1367
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
First we get her
off the drugs,

1368
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
and then we deal
with the issues
behind the drugs.

1369
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:54,000
Now, I should warn you...

1370
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:57,000
You probably won’t have
any contact with her
for quite a while.

1371
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:00,000
She won’t be allowed
to make any phone calls
for the first 14 days

1372
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
or have any visits for 30.

1373
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:05,000
- You won’t need
those kind of rules
for our family.

1374
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:06,000
We’re very supportive.

1375
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:07,000
- I’m sure.

1376
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
But all families
have problems,

1377
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
even supportive ones.

1378
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:38,000
- The baby’s asleep.

1379
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:39,000
Anything the matter?

1380
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
- Ohh...

1381
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
Phoebe’s out there
in some hospital

1382
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:48,000
going through detox.

1383
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:51,000
- Isn’t that
what you wanted?

1384
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:56,000
You knocked yourself
out to get her into
that program.

1385
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
- Did you have
a better suggestion?

1386
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
- Aren’t we just
shipping her off

1387
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
to a different
boarding school,

1388
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:05,000
paying some
stranger to solve
phoebe’s problems?

1389
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
- Simon, somebody had to.

1390
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:11,000
We just put her away
with a houseful
of drug addicts!

1391
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
- She is a drug addict.
That’s what Phoebe is,

1392
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:16,000
and she needs
this kind of help.

1393
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:17,000
- We are her parents!

1394
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:20,000
- We were her parents
when she got into this mess,

1395
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:23,000
and a fat lot of good
it did us!

1396
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:27,000
Letting her poison
her baby while you were out
flying that stupid bird!

1397
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
- I’ve had enough
of this, Nell.

1398
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:32,000
I don’t see that
you did much better.

1399
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
- Well, at least
I did something!

1400
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:37,000
"Thinking the deed
and not the creed

1401
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
would help us in
our utmost need."

1402
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
- Simon, would
you stop that?

1403
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
Can’t you ever say anything
in your own words?

1404
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
- I don’t have the words
for this, Nell!

1405
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:46,000
Maybe somebody else
would.

1406
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:49,000
I am coping with this
the best way I know how!

1407
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
- You’re not
coping at all!

1408
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
I’ve had to make
every single decision!

1409
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:56,000
- That’s right, Nell!
That’s right! You had to!

1410
01:12:56,000 --> 01:13:00,000
- Well, as usual,
you dumped the whole
thing in my lap!

1411
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
- Because trying
to reason with you

1412
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
is like standing
in front of a bulldozer!

1413
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:07,000
No wonder our daughter
takes drugs!

1414
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
- Are you saying
that’s my fault?

1415
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:11,000
- Well, maybe it is.

1416
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:16,000
Oh...no, I didn’t
mean that.

1417
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:21,000
- You did mean that.
- Nell, I’m sorry.

1418
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
- I’m sorry, too.

1419
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
- Nell,
where are you going?

1420
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
- I’m going to
sleep downstairs.

1421
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:51,000
- Nell, don’t do that.
Don’t be ridiculous.

1422
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
- Well, whatever
you all think,

1423
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:23,000
Lucinda and I have
noticed a big lapse
in discipline lately,

1424
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:26,000
so this is going to be
the policy from now on.

1425
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
- Yeah, right.

1426
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:29,000
- Ok, and on that note,

1427
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:32,000
Ms. Donna...

1428
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
You want to tell the house

1429
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:37,000
why you were
two hours late on
your day pass yesterday?

1430
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:40,000
- I told you.
I missed my bus.

1431
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
- Next time,
you miss both buses.

1432
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:45,000
- What, are you
grounding me?

1433
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:48,000
- You got a discipline,
and if you keep
flapping your mouth,

1434
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
you’ll get two.

1435
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:53,000
- What do you think
this is...Boot camp?

1436
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:56,000
- This whole house has
an attitude this morning.

1437
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
What is going on here?

1438
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:05,000
- All right. From the gut...
Show of hands.

1439
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:08,000
How many people here
want to be here?

1440
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
How many need to be here?

1441
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
Phoebe?

1442
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:30,000
How about you?

1443
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
Good.

1444
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
Well, let’s get
this day started.

1445
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
Woman’s group.

1446
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:51,000
- Hey, I’m Ramona.

1447
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
I’m your roommate.

1448
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
It’s going to get easier.

1449
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
Word.

1450
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
- I miss her.

1451
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,000
- I miss her, too.

1452
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:59,000
I never thought
this would happen
to our family.

1453
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
- Oh, well.

1454
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:05,000
Some things are
out of our hands.

1455
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
- Hmm.

1456
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:11,000
At least we’ll be able
to see her finally,

1457
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:12,000
day after tomorrow.

1458
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:15,000
- That place,
with the...

1459
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:18,000
Therapist hanging
on every word.

1460
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:21,000
- Does that mean you’re
not going with me?

1461
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
- Should I come with you?

1462
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:29,000
- No, not if you
have to ask.

1463
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
I’ll take care of it.

1464
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,000
- Fine.
You take care of it.

1465
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:37,000
You go in and fix it.
You always do.

1466
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:56,000
- Do you like it?
- Mm-hmm.

1467
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:57,000
- ’cause I could
exchange it.

1468
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:00,000
- No, don’t.
It’s great, really. Mm-hmm.

1469
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:03,000
- You look good.
You got some color back.

1470
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:06,000
- Are you talking about
anyone in particular?

1471
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
- I’m talking
about everyone
in particular,

1472
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
but especially you.

1473
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:14,000
- Oh, hey! You’re phoebe’s mom,
from the congress.

1474
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:17,000
- Yeah, we heard
all about you.

1475
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:21,000
Ooh, that sweater
is too cool.

1476
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
You bring this
for Olivia?

1477
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:24,000
- Mm-hmm.

1478
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
- Phoebe,
you got it made.

1479
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
My mother?

1480
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
I told her I’m
checking in here.

1481
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
She punched my face.

1482
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:33,000
- How long have
you been here?

1483
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
- Too long.

1484
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
- Who left dirty
dishes all over
the counter?

1485
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:40,000
- Excuse me. We are talking.

1486
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:41,000
- Oh, hi. I’m Ramona.

1487
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:45,000
Oh, you got to
be phoebe’s mother.

1488
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
You look
like each other.

1489
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:52,000
- No, we don’t. Do we?

1490
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
- Yes. I think so.

1491
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
How long have
you been here, Ramona?

1492
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:59,000
- Six months
and five days.

1493
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:00,000
- Is it working out?

1494
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:01,000
- I love it here.

1495
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
- You love it?

1496
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:06,000
- It’s better
than what’s on the street.

1497
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:07,000
- You got that right.

1498
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:10,000
At least there’s nobody
trying to kill you,

1499
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:13,000
just making you
follow these rules

1500
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:14,000
day and night.

1501
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
- How did you
all get here?

1502
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:19,000
- Bus.

1503
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:22,000
[Laughter]

1504
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:25,000
- Move your big feet.

1505
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:28,000
- Hi. I’m Tory.
- Oh, hi, Tory.

1506
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
- I got hooked on crack

1507
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:33,000
trying to make it through
grad school and hold down
two day jobs.

1508
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:37,000
Day before midterms, I woke
up in the emergency room.

1509
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
- My boyfriend beat me up

1510
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:42,000
when he found out
I was pregnant,

1511
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
and I just had my hands
like this, saying,

1512
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:47,000
"please, god, if you
spare this baby,

1513
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
I swear
I’ll get straight."

1514
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:52,000
- I’d been shunted
around for a year.

1515
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
I knew I had to
stop drugging,

1516
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:57,000
but I didn’t
trust no one out on the street

1517
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
to look after my kid.

1518
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
- Was that true
of all of you?

1519
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:04,000
- I had to go
to nine programs

1520
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
before I found one that
would take me pregnant.

1521
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:09,000
- You don’t know what
it’s like out there.

1522
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
You just don’t know.

1523
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
- Senator Dietz
got us an endorsement
from his committee,

1524
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
and we’ve got
a clear majority on
the house subcommittee,

1525
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:21,000
so all things considered,

1526
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:24,000
we’re on top
of our game with
the reforestation bill.

1527
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
- Great.
Oh, that’s great.

1528
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
- Charlie would
have been proud.

1529
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:32,000
- Yeah. Yeah,
he would have been.

1530
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
Well, listen.

1531
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:35,000
I have one more
order of business.

1532
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
I’ve been doing
some research here

1533
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:40,000
on drug treatment programs
for pregnant women

1534
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:43,000
and women with babies.

1535
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,000
You know, there ought to be
a place like family house

1536
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:48,000
in every town
in the United States,

1537
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:49,000
but of course
nobody’s got any funding.

1538
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,000
- So, what’s
your proposal?

1539
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:54,000
- I want to go public
with phoebe’s recovery.

1540
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:57,000
I want to call
a press conference,

1541
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,000
do a TV segment,
and educate people.

1542
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:02,000
- With all due respect, Nell,
you’re out of your mind.

1543
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:03,000
- Am I?

1544
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:06,000
- Look, you tell
the average voter

1545
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:09,000
you want to spend
government money
on drug-addict mothers,

1546
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:10,000
and he’s gonna say,

1547
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:13,000
"they should just
lock them up and take
their babies away."

1548
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,000
- And do what with them?

1549
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,000
These average voters
want to adopt them?

1550
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:21,000
Or they want their taxes
to pay for these babies’

1551
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:24,000
foster care or their
special ed classes

1552
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:25,000
or their jail sentences?

1553
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:28,000
And what about
when these babies grow up,

1554
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
and their babies
have drug problems?

1555
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
- That’s the way you see it
because you’re involved.

1556
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
- Oh, wait, wait.

1557
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:38,000
Do you know
that in this country

1558
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:41,000
1 out of 10 babies
is prenatally exposed

1559
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
to illicit drugs?

1560
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,000
- What about Phoebe?
How does she feel?

1561
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:46,000
Did you ask her?

1562
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
- No, but I will.
- Yes, but, Nell...

1563
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:51,000
- If people don’t
come forward and talk
about these problems,

1564
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
the stigma’s
going to get worse,

1565
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:56,000
and the battle is just
going to get harder.

1566
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
- She’s already
written her speech.

1567
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:01,000
- You’re really
determined to do this
thing, aren’t you?

1568
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,000
- Yes!

1569
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:06,000
- All right. Now, this
is going to help you

1570
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:09,000
calm your baby down
when he’s hysterical.

1571
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:12,000
You’re going to cradle
his head in one hand

1572
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:15,000
and his rear
in the other.

1573
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:18,000
Ok, so his head is
higher up than his feet,

1574
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:19,000
and you can make...

1575
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:24,000
- Eye contact.
- Right.

1576
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:27,000
And you’re going to
rock him gently, up and down.

1577
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:30,000
Not back and forth,
that will just wire him more,

1578
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
up and down,
vertical rocking.

1579
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:35,000
When your baby starts
to quiet down,

1580
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,000
try adding some sound.

1581
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,000
You can talk, sing,

1582
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
just so long
as you take it

1583
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,000
one step at a time.

1584
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:46,000
Drug babies are what they
call hypersensitive.

1585
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:49,000
Now, we all know
they’re hyper, right?

1586
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,000
But don’t forget sensitive.

1587
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:55,000
These kids understand you
through your fingers,

1588
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:58,000
and you want them to
understand that no matter
what comes down,

1589
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
you’ll always be there
for them.

1590
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
[Knock on door]

1591
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
Excuse me. Phoebe,
can I see you in
my office, please?

1592
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
Your mother’s here.

1593
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:09,000
- Aw, Phoebe, what’s she
bringing you this time?

1594
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
- Take her?

1595
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,000
Thanks.

1596
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:16,000
You want me to go on TV

1597
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
and tell
5 million people

1598
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
I gave cocaine
to my baby?

1599
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
- You’re taking this
the wrong way.

1600
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:25,000
- I’m telling you how I feel.
I don’t believe this!

1601
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:28,000
- Look, Phoebe, nobody’s
going to do this TV piece
unless you approve it.

1602
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:29,000
- I don’t!

1603
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:32,000
- Phoebe, how do you
think things get done?

1604
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:33,000
People step forward.

1605
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
- Yeah, when they decide to,

1606
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
not when their mothers decide
it’s political football!

1607
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
- Would you please
just give this a chance?

1608
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:43,000
I know it’s not easy,
but if you’ll just try,

1609
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,000
you’ll see
how good you feel

1610
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,000
knowing your story
is going to help
somebody else.

1611
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
- I can’t think about
anybody else right now.

1612
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:52,000
- Don’t be so selfish!
- Selfish?

1613
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:55,000
Where do you think
I learned that from,

1614
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
miss back-on-the-job
six-days-later?

1615
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,000
- Listen to
what she’s saying.

1616
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,000
- Every time you trot
out that old story,

1617
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,000
do you know
what I’m thinking?

1618
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:06,000
I had your attention
for less than a week!

1619
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
I couldn’t compete
with the supreme court!

1620
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:11,000
- You had my love and
attention every day
of your life!

1621
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:14,000
- Oh, if I did, then when
did I start taking drugs,

1622
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
if you were paying
so much attention?

1623
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:19,000
- I don’t want...
- My 12th birthday!

1624
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,000
- What?

1625
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:24,000
- You remember
that student assistant
dad hired that fall?

1626
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:28,000
I came home from
school early one day,
and he was making dinner.

1627
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
He was smoking a joint.
I cut a deal with him.

1628
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
I said, "I won’t
bust you to daddy
if you let me try it."

1629
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:36,000
He kept me in pot
the whole time
he lived with us.

1630
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
- Why didn’t you
tell us?

1631
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:41,000
- Oh, come on, mother!
Why do you think?

1632
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:42,000
I was getting
away with it,

1633
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:45,000
and besides,
you weren’t there!

1634
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:48,000
- So it’s my fault you
started taking drugs?

1635
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:51,000
- Oh, I’m so sorry, mother.
No, it’s my fault.

1636
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:52,000
Does that make you happy?

1637
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
Is that what
you want to hear?

1638
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
My whole life
is my fault!

1639
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:57,000
I mean, I’ve never accomplished
anything, anyway,

1640
01:24:57,000 --> 01:25:00,000
so I’ll just go on TV,
and I’ll say,

1641
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:04,000
"hi, I’m Nell Harrington’s
daughter, the drug addict!"

1642
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:07,000
How can you
do this to me?

1643
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,000
- I’m not doing
something to you.

1644
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:12,000
I’m trying to do
something for you!

1645
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:16,000
- Well, then stop
doing things for me!

1646
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:19,000
You can’t make decisions
for me anymore.

1647
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:22,000
This is my recovery!
It’s mine!

1648
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:26,000
You can’t even
let me have this
without taking over!

1649
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
- I’m not trying to take...
- Well, you are, mother.

1650
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
What, you want to come in here
with your cameras?

1651
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
You want to ruin
what’s left of my life?

1652
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:35,000
You want to turn Olivia
into a poster child?

1653
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:38,000
Fine! You go ahead.
Do what you want.

1654
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
- Mrs. Harrington?

1655
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:50,000
I have to put
phoebe’s needs first.

1656
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,000
- Alden,
get me some studies

1657
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:58,000
on family incomes
and college loans.

1658
01:25:58,000 --> 01:25:59,000
- You got it.

1659
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,000
- I don’t know
how such a dunce

1660
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:02,000
got to be a member of
an education committee.

1661
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
- Nell?
- Simon?

1662
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
- Simon. Wait a minute, Alden.
What’s the matter?

1663
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:10,000
What’s the matter?
- They called me at home.

1664
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:13,000
Phoebe’s dropped
out of the program.

1665
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:18,000
- She has got to come
back here. That’s
all there is to it.

1666
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
- I hope she does,
but the program
is voluntary.

1667
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:23,000
Residents are responsible
for their own actions.

1668
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:26,000
- All the ladies
tried to talk her
out of this.

1669
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
It hurts everyone
when somebody leaves.

1670
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:29,000
- Now, there is
a 24-hour grace period

1671
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,000
before we have to
relinquish her spot
to a new client,

1672
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:34,000
and Phoebe
is aware of this.

1673
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
But if she doesn’t
check in,

1674
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:39,000
we are legally bound
to report Olivia’s
status to the dcys.

1675
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,000
If it were any
of our other clients,

1676
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:42,000
she’d probably
lose custody,

1677
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
but we all know
that the child welfare

1678
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
is not going to
go after somebody with
phoebe’s background...

1679
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
If she doesn’t
endanger her baby.

1680
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:51,000
- I’ll get her back here.
I know how to find her.

1681
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:57,000
- Phoebe used
your intervention
as a reason to drop out.

1682
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,000
If she’s looking
for a reason to stay out,

1683
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,000
you’d be feeding
right into it.

1684
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,000
- But...then
what can I do?

1685
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:07,000
- Let her make
her own mistakes,
if she has to.

1686
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:08,000
You can’t
do this for her.

1687
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
- I don’t have a daughter.

1688
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
I just don’t have
a daughter now.

1689
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:29,000
- Yes, well...

1690
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:32,000
- We can’t just
leave her out there.

1691
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
- You heard
what that woman said.

1692
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:37,000
The best thing
for Phoebe is not
to pressure her.

1693
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:38,000
- I have to do something.

1694
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
- No, Nell, you don’t.
You have to do nothing,

1695
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:43,000
for once in your life.

1696
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,000
- I’m just trying
to solve this.

1697
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,000
- Who gave you
this power?

1698
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:50,000
It’s not
on your shoulders
to solve everything.

1699
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
You just keep at it.

1700
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
And now look
what’s happened.

1701
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
Look what you’ve done.

1702
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:57,000
- Whatever I’ve done,

1703
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,000
I’ve done because
I love Phoebe.

1704
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,000
She is my child.

1705
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:04,000
I can’t bear the idea of her
not being in my life.

1706
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:07,000
- You bear not having
me in your life?

1707
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:08,000
’cause that’s where
we’re heading.

1708
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
I don’t know, Nell.

1709
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
I’ve been thinking
I might want to go
up to Cambridge

1710
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
and work on my book,

1711
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:19,000
take a place up there.

1712
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:26,000
- Well, you do
what you have to do.

1713
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,000
- I’ll try, frank,
but I really think

1714
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:40,000
you’re going to
have to get somebody else.

1715
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:43,000
No, no, I’m fine.
