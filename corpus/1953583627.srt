00:00:59,167 --> 00:01:04,167
"A sexually repressed society
will resort to violence." Wilhelm Reich

2
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:10,967
What are you doing here?
You were supposed to stay inside.

3
00:01:11,601 --> 00:01:14,001
I didn't know you had another job.

4
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,201
I called these guys. One during
the day and another one at night.

5
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,867
Let's go.

6
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,867
Lie down as flat as you can.

7
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:31,300
And if we got to stop, pull that old tarp
and cover yourself and don't move.

8
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,600
I'm going to drop in the place of a friend.

9
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,867
It's at night, but at least you
have something to eat.

10
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,867
Why are you doing all of this?

11
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,200
Because you're in trouble.

12
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,200
You know you don't owe me anything.

13
00:01:48,701 --> 00:01:50,335
Don't talk like that.

14
00:01:51,801 --> 00:01:53,335
That's no help.

15
00:02:12,801 --> 00:02:16,468
Angela, this is Bill.
I told you about him.

16
00:02:16,701 --> 00:02:19,834
I'm going to go to Roberto's to find a
place for him to stay for a couple of days.

17
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,200
I should be back in an hour.

18
00:02:22,734 --> 00:02:24,301
Go have a seat.

19
00:02:24,601 --> 00:02:27,068
I'll bring you something to eat.

20
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:03,100
I don't have any money.

21
00:03:03,534 --> 00:03:04,901
That's OK.

22
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,001
Most people who come here
don't have any money.

23
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:13,567
Luis said he's trying to get you
out of here in the next truck.

24
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,300
That's his idea.

25
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,667
Well, if I understood correctly,
you are in some kind of trouble.

26
00:03:23,734 --> 00:03:25,034
Yeah ...

27
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,667
You don't look like someone
who gets into trouble.

28
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,801
That's 'cause, in a way, I probably
still look like a banker.

29
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,300
I jumped bail.

30
00:03:42,734 --> 00:03:44,535
You don't like it?

31
00:03:47,434 --> 00:03:49,434
I'm not very hungry.

32
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,600
Angela, can I pay tomorrow?
- No problem.

33
00:04:07,801 --> 00:04:09,435
Bye. - Adios.

34
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:22,101
That was Luis who called.

35
00:04:22,834 --> 00:04:25,601
His friend, Roberto, has been arrested.

36
00:04:26,367 --> 00:04:28,901
He asked if you could find a place
to stay for tonight,

37
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,567
and he can meet you here tomorrow.

38
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:35,600
Sure ...

39
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:38,534
Thanks for the food.

40
00:04:39,334 --> 00:04:40,367
Sure.

41
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,801
Do you have a place to go?

42
00:04:56,501 --> 00:04:57,801
Ola.
- How are you?

43
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,267
Very good. How are you?
Oh, thank you.

44
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,901
You're welcome.

45
00:05:03,834 --> 00:05:05,401
What did she give you?

46
00:05:06,167 --> 00:05:07,968
A quarter.

47
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,300
Why?

48
00:05:10,501 --> 00:05:14,634
I give her some food every night,
and she insists on giving me a quarter.

49
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:17,367
Out of dignity.
She will not accept free food.

50
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:21,667
Even if she can't feed her kids,
and she has three jobs.

51
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,600
Three jobs?
- Yeah ...

52
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,801
she sells flowers in the evening,
as you can see.

53
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,067
She cleans offices at night and
during the day she works in a sweatshop ...

54
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:35,467
with her oldest daughter.
-A "sweatshop"?

55
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,001
Yeah... you know ...

56
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:41,467
the kind where they work twelve hours a day
with half an hour break ...

57
00:05:41,701 --> 00:05:44,101
for less than minimum wage.

58
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,801
Her husband left her.
She's all alone.

59
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,100
See? Not much dignity there.

60
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:52,201
Not much luck either.
- Do you believe in luck?

61
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,200
I believe more in bad luck.

62
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,500
You?

63
00:05:57,701 --> 00:06:01,368
Yeah... I believe everything in life
happens from bad luck...

64
00:06:01,701 --> 00:06:03,502
and will.

65
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:07,467
Will? You mean like the will of God?

66
00:06:07,901 --> 00:06:09,802
No ... No.

67
00:06:09,901 --> 00:06:13,702
I mean your own will.
I stopped believing in God a long time ago.

68
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,500
Really?

69
00:06:15,701 --> 00:06:18,368
Yeah. Too many people
who died in His name.

70
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,001
It's here.

71
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Welcome to my living scrapbook.

72
00:06:50,968 --> 00:06:52,268
It's safe.

73
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,467
We're on the roof,
so it's a little hot.

74
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,200
That door goes out.

75
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:01,367
And when one person needs privacy,
the other one can go outside.

76
00:07:01,501 --> 00:07:04,568
Listen... I don't have
to stay here.

77
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,001
Of course you don't.

78
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:18,001
Don't worry.
I'm used to having people here.

79
00:07:19,901 --> 00:07:23,635
The other good thing about being on the roof,
is that from up there you can see the world.

80
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:27,367
Come out. I'll show you.

81
00:07:30,934 --> 00:07:32,735
What's that?

82
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,267
That is ...

83
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,200
The "L" of "Life."

84
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,200
See?

85
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,201
I also have the "H".

86
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:52,167
There's no "H" in "Life".

87
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,001
So, it must be the "H" of "Hell".

88
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:05,167
I take it, you don't
believe in Hell either?

89
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:08,967
Oh, yeah. I believe in Hell.
I believe in Hell on Earth.

90
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,400
I see it every day.

91
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,600
It was the old sign from the hotel.

92
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,001
I dragged it in at the beginning.

93
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:22,200
It still worked. It was my only source
of light. I got used to it.

94
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:28,300
From up here you can hear
all the life of the city...

95
00:08:28,601 --> 00:08:31,601
and you can see all layers of society.

96
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,600
on that side only poor people.

97
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,001
Dealers, prostitutes ...

98
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,801
below us is a transient hotel ...

99
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:47,000
for those who don't have anything anymore
but still need to find a way to survive

100
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:50,500
over here we have middle class people ...

101
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,467
in their condo apartments.

102
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:59,801
I recommend watching the couple in this apartment,
who have sex every night at their window.

103
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:05,100
And over here,
we have the financial district.

104
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:11,067
with its luxurious hotels and some of
the most powerful banks in the world.

105
00:09:15,901 --> 00:09:18,168
I used to work over there.

106
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,201
So, what went wrong for the banker?

107
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,867
Ambition... need for power...

108
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,700
Really?

109
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:41,767
That's it? - Pretty much.

110
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:47,701
I made a big hole in the bank.

111
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:06,100
And? What happened?

112
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,500
And from that point everything collapsed.

113
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:16,767
Lawsuits, bankruptcy.
Mine. Not the bank's of course.

114
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:23,034
I lost my house; my family rejected me;
my wife divorced me.

115
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:25,500
Everybody deserted me.

116
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,001
That's funny.

117
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:34,834
Where I come from, the son is in trouble,
everybody comes to help.

118
00:10:44,901 --> 00:10:48,568
It's from Peru.
A friend of mine brought it back.

119
00:10:49,501 --> 00:10:52,501
Go ahead.
It will help you dream at night.

120
00:10:52,601 --> 00:10:55,268
I don't dream anymore. - You do.

121
00:10:55,501 --> 00:10:57,501
You just don't want to remember them.

122
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,700
Maybe.

123
00:11:06,601 --> 00:11:09,601
They always think I should
leave this place, but...

124
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,801
I've been here for years
without any problems.

125
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:18,700
I guess you're not really interested
in possessions, are you?

126
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:24,600
If possessions were important in life,
rich people would be happy.

127
00:11:28,601 --> 00:11:31,601
You can sleep in the bed with me,
if you want.

128
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:36,967
Don't worry, you don't have to have
sex with me.

129
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:47,200
If you prefer, I have a sleeping bag.
I could set it up for you over there.

130
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:52,201
That would be fine...
thank you.

131
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:15,400
OK... enjoy.

132
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,101
Since it's very hot
and there're no walls, ...

133
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:21,467
if nudity bothers you,
you can go outside while I undress.

134
00:12:21,901 --> 00:12:24,502
Or you can stay.
It doesn't bother me.

135
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,600
Really?
- Really.

136
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,467
Well, I'll just turn towards the wall.

137
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,867
OK. Good night.

138
00:12:40,501 --> 00:12:42,901
Try to remember your dreams.

139
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,101
Oh my ...

140
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:07,001
Hi.

141
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,001
How are you?

142
00:13:47,701 --> 00:13:48,901
Hey ...

143
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,100
How come you didn't run away?

144
00:13:53,901 --> 00:13:56,502
I guess I needed a chance to be alone.

145
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,201
Away from it all...

146
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,601
solitude for a lonely man.

147
00:14:02,868 --> 00:14:06,068
Beer and burrito for a lonely man?

148
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Sounds great.

149
00:14:23,601 --> 00:14:25,035
You were right, it's...

150
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,567
very, very interesting to
watch people from up here.

151
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:33,001
Did you notice how frantic they all are?

152
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:36,901
They all run around honking at each other.

153
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,600
as if the few minutes they gain
would change anything in their life.

154
00:14:42,767 --> 00:14:46,867
I guess that's kind of the way
I've been living - always running.

155
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,467
Running for more.

156
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,600
You American people live in the future.

157
00:14:57,801 --> 00:15:02,068
The future? - What did you do
with the first money you earned?...

158
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:05,201
first big chunk you got?

159
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:11,567
Bought a house, new car.

160
00:15:12,801 --> 00:15:15,001
Invested the rest in stock.

161
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:18,001
To make more money later.

162
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:22,001
And what would you have done
with more money?

163
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:26,001
Bought a bigger house,
more stock, probably.

164
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,434
See?

165
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:33,934
You continue to kill yourself
for later, for the future.

166
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:39,700
Rather than enjoying what you had at the time,
you risked everything for the future.

167
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,700
I guess you could look at it that way.

168
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:47,567
Since we're born
without that ...

169
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:52,701
if God put us here it was because
He had a purpose for us...

170
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:56,400
a destiny that we were
 supposed to figure out.

171
00:15:56,901 --> 00:16:00,702
Can you see how crazy it is to think
that we have a purpose in life?

172
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,667
Well, you don't think
your life has a purpose?

173
00:16:04,067 --> 00:16:06,534
No. I don't.

174
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:12,101
We are here by chance, by accident.

175
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Your father met your mother, fucked her,
and you were born.

176
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:21,567
And you can think of two million good reasons
for you father to have met another girl,

177
00:16:21,701 --> 00:16:24,101
and then you wouldn't even be here.

178
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,801
But, who am I to talk?

179
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,400
We need some music here.

180
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,600
I should go meet Luis.

181
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:21,600
Luis says the next truck doesn't leave
for two or three days.

182
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:24,100
Cops are still looking for you.

183
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:34,567
You know Luis was my driver?

184
00:17:36,033 --> 00:17:37,433
Yeah ...

185
00:17:38,534 --> 00:17:43,035
Luis is a great guy. Do you know
anything about him?

186
00:17:49,667 --> 00:17:53,800
Luis was a farmer ... in Honduras.

187
00:17:57,701 --> 00:18:01,968
He and his wife had a couple of
fields of coffee.

188
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,100
They were able to live from it, you know.
Not well, but they lived,

189
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:10,300
until small growers weren't needed
any more.

190
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,001
And, little by little,
they were not able to survive.

191
00:18:15,801 --> 00:18:19,934
So he had to sell the farm,
but his wife didn't want him to.

192
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:23,101
They moved to Tegucigalpa to find jobs,

193
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,467
and then his wife got sick.

194
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,200
He could not afford any doctors
or medicine, so

195
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:33,201
she died.

196
00:18:35,501 --> 00:18:37,501
That is when he came here.

197
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:40,767
Can you see the irony?

198
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,801
Immigrant driver gets his banker boss
out of trouble.

199
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:49,734
Look, I don't need him to get me
out of trouble, OK.

200
00:18:51,767 --> 00:18:53,767
I'm done.

201
00:18:53,934 --> 00:18:55,835
You didn't get it, did you?

202
00:18:56,300 --> 00:19:00,300
You exist. That is
what matters.

203
00:19:00,501 --> 00:19:04,601
That you live.
- It's not so bad being at the end.

204
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,001
It's actually quite peaceful,
almost liberating.

205
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:14,500
Can you stop thinking of yourself as different
or more special than anybody else?

206
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:19,767
For me, I'm close to suffering all day long,
and then it's not peaceful.

207
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,800
Well, you're right about
one thing, Professor ...

208
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,801
there's nothing more to lose.

209
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,667
So, what do you suggest?

210
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:33,901
Stop thinking and start to feel
what is around you.

211
00:19:35,501 --> 00:19:40,002
The city, music, me ...

212
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:45,201
Have you even really looked at me,
since we met?

213
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:50,634
I just mean as a human being,
one human being to another human being.

214
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:58,001
What if for once you let things happen
without trying to control them?

215
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,867
Close your eyes and try to feel.

216
00:20:58,901 --> 00:21:00,702
What are you doing?

217
00:21:03,767 --> 00:21:06,234
You agreed you had nothing to lose.

218
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:11,333
Don't think anymore.
Just enjoy.

219
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,801
Who are you?

220
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:03,200
I'm just a little part of your
here-and-now. No more than that.

221
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:10,367
You're right. It's my turn.

222
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:15,601
I come from Nicaragua, where the people
are extremely poor.

223
00:24:16,501 --> 00:24:19,768
My mother was from Algeria.
- From where?

224
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:25,034
Algeria ... My father
was the one from Nicaragua.

225
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,467
I was raised by my grandmother,
after my parents were killed.

226
00:24:29,701 --> 00:24:31,502
They were killed?

227
00:24:31,701 --> 00:24:33,968
They died when I was very young.

228
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:37,567
So I was raised by my grandmother, ...

229
00:24:37,901 --> 00:24:40,301
and my grandmother was a teacher.

230
00:24:40,501 --> 00:24:45,035
Actually she couldn't find a job as a teacher,
so to feed us she became a janitor.

231
00:24:45,767 --> 00:24:51,434
She wound up cleaning this huge library
at night, at the central university.

232
00:24:51,901 --> 00:24:54,502
That's really where I got
most of my education.

233
00:24:54,701 --> 00:24:58,168
I was too young to stay alone,
so she used to bring me with her.

234
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:04,800
For a young girl, it was this
huge, magical place ...

235
00:25:04,901 --> 00:25:06,968
with thousands of books.

236
00:25:07,834 --> 00:25:11,834
She taught me how to choose my books,
and read while waiting for her.

237
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,467
after she died, I took over her job,

238
00:25:15,701 --> 00:25:19,968
cleaning as fast as I could, and spending
the rest of the time reading.

239
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,667
Let's go inside.

240
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,400
Are you here illegally?

241
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:33,001
Yeah. I want to keep it that way.

242
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:36,567
I really don't want to become
a part of this country.

243
00:25:41,501 --> 00:25:44,168
What did you do when you first got here?

244
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:49,200
It was fun, actually.

245
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:54,201
The only address I had was a
hippie community in San Francisco

246
00:25:54,801 --> 00:25:58,468
I always thought they would be
the only Americans I could deal with.

247
00:25:59,767 --> 00:26:02,568
This is the only thing I kept from there.

248
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:07,567
- What happened?
- It was great.

249
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:11,001
From the beginning they
welcomed me, they helped me.

250
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,600
They taught me to speak American.

251
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,801
Some of those pictures are from there.

252
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,200
Still uncomfortable with me?

253
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:30,367
Seems like you enjoyed it outside.

254
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:35,867
I did.

255
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:45,200
Don't tell me you'll sleep
on the floor again?

256
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:48,867
Don't worry. I know I'm not the type
that bankers like.

257
00:26:49,901 --> 00:26:53,901
I don't have blond hair
or an American body.

258
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,200
I'm not even pure Latina.

259
00:26:56,501 --> 00:26:58,501
I'm just a mutt.

260
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,600
Why are you doing all this?

261
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,600
Does nudity bother you?

262
00:27:15,501 --> 00:27:16,968
Better?

263
00:27:18,467 --> 00:27:24,867
You know, when I was a teenager we used
to say: "Life's a bitch, and then you die."

264
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,200
I guess I'm beginning to understand
what it means.

265
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,600
Well, we say the same thing, but ...

266
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:39,333
at the end we added:
"So fuck the bitch."

267
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:47,600
Look, I agree, for most people
life is not very beautiful.

268
00:27:47,968 --> 00:27:50,635
I just try to make every moment
as good as possible.

269
00:28:00,501 --> 00:28:05,768
See? I'm exactly the opposite of what
men like you are interested in.

270
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:09,201
How do you know what kind
of women I like?

271
00:28:10,601 --> 00:28:12,135
Why?

272
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,434
Do you have a hard-on?

273
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,600
No ...

274
00:28:19,701 --> 00:28:21,168
Show me.

275
00:28:21,567 --> 00:28:23,101
Show me.

276
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:29,800
Huevones! That's what you are.

277
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:34,001
You people are such Puritans.
- Huevones ...

278
00:28:35,601 --> 00:28:39,734
It means "big balls, no guts."

279
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:46,500
It's only you and me here.

280
00:28:46,801 --> 00:28:50,402
Nobody to judge you.
Show me!

281
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,034
Bravo!

282
00:29:27,501 --> 00:29:29,302
Come here.

283
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:35,001
Don't think now.
Just enjoy.

284
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:38,300
What do you feel right now?

285
00:29:39,234 --> 00:29:41,234
I don't know ...

286
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,767
Arousal.

287
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,967
Me too.

288
00:29:48,667 --> 00:29:52,468
Strong desire for you to kiss my breasts.

289
00:29:59,601 --> 00:30:03,001
Touch me ... here.

290
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,634
Come inside me.

291
00:30:35,701 --> 00:30:37,135
Fuck me.

292
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:51,400
Take me; take me like ...

293
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,200
Come on. Harder, harder!

294
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,200
Do you like it? - Yeah ...

295
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:16,700
Did you enjoy watching yourself?

296
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:21,767
I think I have a hard time looking
at myself, right now.

297
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:27,800
You should love this guy who came so hard.

298
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:31,767
Maybe it's the banker you should
have dropped long ago.

299
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:35,001
So sex is the solution for you?

300
00:32:35,701 --> 00:32:38,968
You know, research shows that ...

301
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:43,200
a lack of sexual pleasure
leads to frustration ...

302
00:32:43,501 --> 00:32:46,501
bitterness, anger, violence ...

303
00:32:46,701 --> 00:32:48,502
All that, huh?

304
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,801
When's the last time you had sex?

305
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:55,801
I don't know ...
months ago.

306
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:59,700
And when you were married,
how often did you have sex?

307
00:32:59,968 --> 00:33:02,968
Once a week, ...
maybe.

308
00:33:04,901 --> 00:33:06,702
Do you masturbate?

309
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:16,601
You Americans are such a bunch of
frustrated hypocrites. I can't believe it.

310
00:33:18,701 --> 00:33:23,801
You can show body-parts and heads
being blown away on TV ...

311
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:26,100
movies, video games ...

312
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:30,700
like it's no value whatsoever, but ...

313
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,600
you can't talk openly about masturbation.

314
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:39,001
I don't get it.

315
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,901
Doesn't everybody have sex?

316
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:46,634
Doesn't every boy or man masturbate ...
have erections.

317
00:33:46,901 --> 00:33:50,502
Why should it be hidden?
- Yeah, you're probably right.

318
00:33:50,901 --> 00:33:55,435
I mean, of course I masturbated
every now and then when I was a kid.

319
00:33:56,200 --> 00:34:00,467
I guess I just stopped it after college.

320
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,200
It seemed childish.

321
00:34:04,701 --> 00:34:07,168
Pleasure is childish.

322
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:10,767
You people.

323
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:41,600
Do you regret it? - What?

324
00:34:43,501 --> 00:34:48,601
Both ... that you stopped masturbating
and having sex with me.

325
00:34:48,901 --> 00:34:52,502
Having sex with you? No.

326
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:58,001
Masturbating ... I don't know.

327
00:34:58,234 --> 00:35:00,234
Why do you ask?

328
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:05,201
To see that even in your
desperate situation ...

329
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:08,700
having a good time now is better
than waiting.

330
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,667
Now, now, now ...

331
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:17,001
Drink now, live now, fuck now ...

332
00:35:20,501 --> 00:35:25,501
I'm going to start calling you "Now."
Hello, "Now." How are you today?

333
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:30,467
It will be a pleasure.
And I will call you "Later."

334
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,200
Life is now, Mister Later.

335
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:38,100
I know, it's hard to masturbate
in this country

336
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:41,801
where the President is preaching
abstinence to kids.

337
00:35:42,601 --> 00:35:46,268
He's trying to transform this
entire generation with his

338
00:35:46,501 --> 00:35:52,002
insane idea of abstinence, while he's off
doing bombs on women and children.

339
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:55,700
Why are you still in this country ...

340
00:35:55,901 --> 00:35:57,901
if this is what you think of us?

341
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,467
I was waiting for you.

342
00:36:06,501 --> 00:36:10,634
I feel like I'm more useful
here than there.

343
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,001
Useful, you mean, like ...

344
00:36:13,234 --> 00:36:15,035
giving food to poor people?

345
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:19,200
That and my work at the clinic,
and here ...

346
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:24,867
Once a week I tend to people
at the hotel with medical needs.

347
00:36:28,801 --> 00:36:30,101
Plus ...

348
00:36:32,501 --> 00:36:35,968
Can you hear it? The wind!
Can you hear it?

349
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:40,001
Come on. It's coming from
the east... Come on.

350
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:53,500
Come on; help me.

351
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:10,500
Come sit with me.

352
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,667
Take off your clothes,
soldier boy.

353
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,101
Let the wind touch you.

354
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:25,567
It comes from the East. You'll see.

355
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:30,734
It's warm and dry.
I love to feel it.

356
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:34,001
You're not afraid of ashamed
of anything, are you.

357
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:38,100
But I just have one life to live.

358
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:43,467
I mean, I can be afraid, but shame
is for those who believe in ...

359
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,467
heaven or a judgment day, ...

360
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:50,001
you know, who kind of live in the future.

361
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:57,201
Come on, ... come on!

362
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:59,300
Eh, come on. What are you doing?

363
00:37:59,501 --> 00:38:03,601
Remember Mr. Later.
You are living on Now's time.

364
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:20,400
Wait a sec. Those are the
only ones I have.

365
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,200
Time to get rid of the past.

366
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:27,101
I just killed the old you.
Be Happy!

367
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,400
A poor guy will find them
and use them.

368
00:38:29,501 --> 00:38:32,568
I hope your illness is not contagious.

369
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:36,167
Now lay down; let the wind
touch your body.

370
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:37,700
So you think teenagers and kids
should have sex?

371
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:43,700
Sure ... sure, if they feel like it.

372
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:52,467
When they should at least know it's
available to them, a nice girl for them.

373
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:56,467
It's good to learn about
life, and themselves.

374
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:02,467
They shouldn't be ashamed about it,
thinking that it's bad.

375
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,467
It's called "natural sexuality."

376
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:09,600
It's a natural need, like any other.

377
00:41:03,501 --> 00:41:06,768
What are you doing?
- I'm feeling the heat.

378
00:41:07,501 --> 00:41:10,768
Listen, your wife is coming
to Eddie's to see you.

379
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,601
My wife?

380
00:41:12,901 --> 00:41:15,502
She got in touch with Luis,
who's bringing her there.

381
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:18,767
He told me he'll make sure it's OK,
it'll be safe.

382
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:22,100
Can you tell her you couldn't find me?

383
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:25,767
Why don't I just tell her
you don't want to see her?

384
00:41:27,601 --> 00:41:31,734
Thank you, Professor Now,
for reminding me of the way.

385
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:36,267
I never thought I would see
a banker wearing one of my T-shirts.

386
00:41:36,501 --> 00:41:41,168
Yeah, well, banker's shirt was thrown
to the wind yesterday.

387
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:08,201
Hi. -Hi.

388
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:26,001
You know, the police came to
my parent's house ...

389
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:29,201
to see if I knew where you were.

390
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,867
I can't believe you jumped bail.

391
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:37,400
You're a fugitive now ...

392
00:42:38,601 --> 00:42:40,502
a wanted man.

393
00:42:49,701 --> 00:42:51,701
Do you realize that ...

394
00:42:51,901 --> 00:42:54,301
I invested my best years ...

395
00:42:54,901 --> 00:42:56,802
into our marriage.

396
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,200
"Invested."

397
00:42:59,901 --> 00:43:02,101
You're starting to sound like me.

398
00:43:02,901 --> 00:43:04,968
And what do you expect in return?

399
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:07,567
What did I expect?

400
00:43:08,901 --> 00:43:12,802
A normal life. With my family.

401
00:43:13,501 --> 00:43:15,768
"A normal life" ...

402
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:19,200
What is that?
- What?

403
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:22,001
What do you mean?

404
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:26,001
A normal life is a family
living together ...

405
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:28,200
taking care of their children ...

406
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:32,600
going on vacation with family and friends.

407
00:43:33,801 --> 00:43:36,268
I'm glad you're so sure of that.

408
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:40,901
- And what's wrong with that?
- Something must have been.

409
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,300
Well ...

410
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:45,667
Yes ...

411
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:48,667
You.

412
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:52,200
You ruined it.

413
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,200
I'm sorry.

414
00:43:57,601 --> 00:43:59,601
So, what are you going to do now?

415
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:03,467
I'm leaving the country
in a day or so.

416
00:44:03,701 --> 00:44:05,168
Why?

417
00:44:05,801 --> 00:44:08,201
Why don't you just go to jail?

418
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:12,167
It's only eight years.

419
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:15,200
They'll let you out early ...

420
00:44:15,801 --> 00:44:19,402
and you will have paid your debt
to society, and ... - What debt?

421
00:44:19,901 --> 00:44:22,168
What is it that I owe society?

422
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:27,901
You mean the debt for doing what I was
raised to do, what I was trained to do?

423
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:30,867
The debt for what I got paid to do?

424
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:33,101
Or do you mean my debt to the bank ...

425
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:36,267
that spent years pressuring me
into do its dirty work

426
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,467
You mean that debt?
- What are you talking about?

427
00:44:38,701 --> 00:44:41,502
What dirty work are you talking about?

428
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:47,201
You've changed, Bill.

429
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:51,600
Yeah ...

430
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,400
Let's hope so.

431
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:58,267
And where will you go?

432
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:05,634
Nicaragua.

433
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:08,967
Nicaragua?

434
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:12,767
And then what?

435
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:17,201
You'll be a fugitive for the
rest of your life.

436
00:45:17,901 --> 00:45:20,568
You won't ever be able to come back.

437
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:26,601
What exactly do I have to come back to?

438
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:32,001
Good luck, Bill.

439
00:45:36,501 --> 00:45:38,102
Wait ...

440
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:44,901
Can you pay for the water?

441
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:47,001
I don't have any money.

442
00:45:50,601 --> 00:45:54,402
These are yours. I don't
need them anymore.

443
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:58,400
Enjoy Nicaragua.

444
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:51,001
Sorry, guess I should knock first?

445
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:54,200
How did it go?

446
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:03,500
Why?

447
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:07,001
But why?

448
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:09,001
Just to hear you say that.

449
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:12,801
No, I was on my way back, and ...

450
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:15,200
passed this crazy store ...

451
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:17,767
and I just wanted to give it to you.

452
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:21,001
So I stole it.
- You stole it?

453
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:22,700
Yeah ...

454
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:26,667
I was scared to death.
I couldn't stop running.

455
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:31,001
But it was kind of exciting.
- It was kind of stupid.

456
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:34,001
I mean, if they caught you
and called the cops ...

457
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:39,467
Nah, it felt good anyway,
after my dive into the past.

458
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:43,500
You can talk about it, if you want.

459
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,267
No, there's not much to talk about.

460
00:47:48,901 --> 00:47:51,901
We really didn't have very much
to say to each other.

461
00:47:52,501 --> 00:47:53,901
I felt ...

462
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:57,967
alone ... sitting with her today.

463
00:47:58,501 --> 00:48:00,501
Well, you're always alone.

464
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:03,967
I've felt alone most of my life.

465
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:08,200
This solitude of being missed ...

466
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,400
don't belong to any group ...

467
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:14,200
couldn't find my place ...

468
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:18,533
For Latino men I was always "La Negrita."

469
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:21,867
Little Black one.

470
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:24,200
Just good to play with.

471
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:29,167
Here is ... a little souvenir ...

472
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,634
from that time.

473
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,400
So ...

474
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:42,600
was "la Negrita" ever loved?

475
00:48:44,701 --> 00:48:49,535
Well ... there is true love,
and then there is everything else.

476
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:55,567
Then how do you recognize true love,
Professor Now?

477
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:58,200
You don't, I guess.

478
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:01,600
But any feeling is worth it.

479
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:04,600
So just enjoy it for what it is ...

480
00:49:04,801 --> 00:49:07,801
and don't be afraid to walk away
when the feeling goes.

481
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:10,600
But how do you ...

482
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:14,600
truly enjoy something when you know
it's going to end soon?

483
00:49:15,801 --> 00:49:17,602
What do you mean?

484
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:21,600
Like now, with you ...

485
00:49:22,901 --> 00:49:27,568
I can't stop thinking that in a day or two
I'll be gone, and ...

486
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:30,600
won't ever see you again.

487
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:33,600
Same answer, sooner or later ...

488
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,901
you have to trust it.

489
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:39,901
Just enjoy it. It's worth it.

490
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:42,901
You'll deal with that time when it comes.

491
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:46,400
What's here now will always be yours.

492
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:07,400
What would you desire most?

493
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:12,101
Right this minute? And don't stop yourself.

494
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:14,300
Everything is OK.

495
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:18,967
I'd like to watch you masturbate.

496
00:50:19,534 --> 00:50:22,201
Unless, you know, you ...

497
00:53:18,801 --> 00:53:20,235
Thank you.

498
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:22,867
My pleasure.

499
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:32,100
Do you like it. - Very much.

500
00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:36,001
I'm always hungry after an orgasm.

501
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:47,801
You know, for centuries ...

502
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:54,001
women have been seducing men through food,
doing all sorts of crazy stuff.

503
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:55,767
Well, like what?

504
00:53:58,200 --> 00:53:59,400
Well ...

505
00:53:59,601 --> 00:54:02,601
for example, women used to make bread

506
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:06,101
and sit on the dough ... naked

507
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:09,600
and infuse the dough with their juices.

508
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:11,667
Really?

509
00:54:15,801 --> 00:54:17,801
Where do you come from?

510
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:26,367
You really want to know?

511
00:54:27,701 --> 00:54:29,368
Yeah.

512
00:54:45,901 --> 00:54:48,168
That's my grandmother's village.

513
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:52,400
that's her writing.

514
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:55,200
She's wishing me a good life.

515
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:58,201
She wrote it for me before she died.

516
00:55:02,601 --> 00:55:04,601
That's my mother.

517
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:07,200
She was a singer.

518
00:55:07,501 --> 00:55:09,402
She danced, too.

519
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:27,200
That is my mother ...

520
00:55:27,701 --> 00:55:29,368
her only recording.

521
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:59,400
I have very few memories of my parents.

522
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:05,101
It's hard to grow up without parents.

523
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:08,667
What happened to them?
- They were killed ...

524
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:12,801
by the contras in the beginning
of the civil war.

525
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:15,801
They were part of the
first literacy campaign ...

526
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,801
teaching peasants to read and write

527
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:41,967
This is the only thing I have left
from my father.

528
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:44,600
I thought you said he was a teacher.

529
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:47,200
He was ...

530
00:56:47,701 --> 00:56:50,168
but he was a "Sandinista"

531
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:55,101
He used to go help the peasants harvesting
sugar cane in the fields ...

532
00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:57,201
every week-end.

533
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:03,200
So what about these "Sandinistas?"

534
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:05,500
Well ...

535
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,200
In short we had a dictator
for two decades ...

536
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:10,901
financed and supported by the U.S.

537
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:15,200
The Sandinistas fought them for years,
and little by little the people joined them

538
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:19,467
and created a popular revolution,
deposing the dictator

539
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:22,001
And what happened?

540
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:24,400
And it became a new country.

541
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:27,667
with free health care, free schools ...

542
00:57:27,901 --> 00:57:30,802
literacy campaign in the country ...

543
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:32,500
But ...

544
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:38,467
Unfortunately, the Sandinistas are
what your country calls socialists

545
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:43,200
The Sandinistas didn't want their money
and resources to go to U.S. corporations,

546
00:57:43,300 --> 00:57:45,767
they wanted it to go to their people.

547
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:49,001
So, your actor President, Reagan

548
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:52,867
ordered the CIA to put together an army,
called the contras

549
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,901
to overthrow our government.

550
00:57:55,100 --> 00:57:59,100
and this created a civil war,
that raged on ...

551
00:57:59,300 --> 00:58:01,967
Your CIA got entangled in its mess

552
00:58:02,100 --> 00:58:04,100
and realized that it would need
more money to continue, but

553
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:09,200
it was a secret war, that the
American Congress did not want to finance.

554
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:13,667
So, the CIA decided to sell weapons to Iran

555
00:58:14,100 --> 00:58:17,767
which was forbidden by your
Congress and by international law.

556
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:23,801
And when your CIA needed more money,
they decided to sell drugs.

557
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:26,867
Cocaine, to be precise,

558
00:58:27,100 --> 00:58:30,001
in your country to finance the Contras

559
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:32,600
You read way too many novels.

560
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:36,267
And you don't read enough.

561
00:58:36,501 --> 00:58:38,768
It's all documented.

562
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:42,101
Reagan authorized the CIA ...

563
00:58:42,300 --> 00:58:44,500
to finance an army to
overthrow a government

564
00:58:44,701 --> 00:58:47,101
with money from weapons and drug trade.

565
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:50,867
Carter first, and then Reagan
after him, in full force.

566
00:58:51,100 --> 00:58:53,100
You see, that is what I am trying
to explain to you,

567
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:56,600
People here do not know what is going on
in their own country.

568
00:58:57,300 --> 00:59:01,801
You are educated by Walt Disney,
and Fox News, and ...

569
00:59:02,100 --> 00:59:03,667
Star Wars.

570
00:59:04,100 --> 00:59:06,001
You live in a bubble.

571
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:10,101
Your country has been responsible for the
removal or assassination of

572
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:12,200
dozens of leaders around the world.

573
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:15,001
You want names?

574
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:19,001
Patrice Lumumba, Prime Minister of Congo.

575
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:21,200
Salvador Allende, President of Chile.

576
00:59:21,300 --> 00:59:23,101
Mossadeq, Prime Minister of Iran.

577
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:27,867
All democratically elected, all dead
because of the CIA organized coup.

578
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:30,101
Your country has initiated massacres

579
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:34,001
in Indonesia, Guatemala, Iran ...
- OK.

580
00:59:36,501 --> 00:59:37,901
OK ...

581
00:59:44,701 --> 00:59:46,101
Sorry.

582
00:59:47,501 --> 00:59:49,302
I get worked up.

583
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:52,801
That is why my parents died.

584
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:58,467
It's hard for me to talk only about it.

585
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:04,267
You don't believe me, do you?

586
01:00:24,100 --> 01:00:26,767
That is what was left from my parent's car.

587
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:31,200
After the Contras killed them,
they came to my grandmother's house,

588
01:00:31,300 --> 01:00:34,101
and tossed it at her feet.

589
01:00:35,801 --> 01:00:38,702
She knew immediately what it meant.

590
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:43,600
You know ...

591
01:00:44,501 --> 01:00:47,102
what's confusing is that ...

592
01:00:47,300 --> 01:00:52,134
for the last thirty years I've been living
in a world where we were the heroes ...

593
01:00:52,300 --> 01:00:55,567
and what you're describing
is completely different.

594
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:58,667
It's like two totally different worlds.

595
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:11,400
Did you really believe in this system
in which you were a banker?

596
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,067
Yeah, of course.

597
01:01:14,300 --> 01:01:16,300
I mean, why wouldn't I?

598
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:23,734
Your system remains only because it has
exploited and plundered dozens of countries ...

599
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:29,133
and oppressed and starved millions of people
around the world for decades

600
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:33,200
You know, I worked in foreign markets.

601
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:35,867
I was an international trader,

602
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:39,400
and traders are supposed to influence
foreign markets.

603
01:01:40,100 --> 01:01:43,001
With the international banking system
it's very easy

604
01:01:43,100 --> 01:01:45,701
to cripple the economy of another country.

605
01:01:46,100 --> 01:01:48,167
That's what I did for ten years,

606
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:50,467
and I was rewarded for it.

607
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:54,600
You know what international bankers
call themselves?

608
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:57,600
"Masters of the Universe"

609
01:02:00,100 --> 01:02:03,701
You're kidding, right?
- No, it's true.

610
01:02:03,901 --> 01:02:07,901
We spent our time bidding on the economy
of countries

611
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:13,867
Buy Brazil, bid half a million on Pakistan,
sell Argentina

612
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:16,667
Oh, man ...

613
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:22,001
How did you put a hole in the bank,
"Master of the Universe"?

614
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:25,600
Well ...

615
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:30,701
It was during the time when
Argentina was falling apart ...

616
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:34,801
unable to repay its debt and
heading for election ...

617
01:02:35,100 --> 01:02:37,367
and we were supporting candidates ...
- Who's "We"?

618
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:42,200
Well, the government,
the US government, of course.

619
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,801
Of course.

620
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:46,600
And?

621
01:02:47,100 --> 01:02:48,500
And ...

622
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,667
The bank suddenly decided to buy

623
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:54,267
Argentine debt in massive numbers

624
01:02:54,501 --> 01:02:58,402
and they felt for sure that our candidate
would be elected no matter what.

625
01:02:58,601 --> 01:03:02,578
And since I'd had so much success
doing the same thing with Brazilian debt,

626
01:03:02,834 --> 01:03:05,901
they called me in and put me in charge
of the operation.

627
01:03:06,534 --> 01:03:07,934
And?

628
01:03:08,934 --> 01:03:10,234
And ...

629
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:14,600
They put enormous pressure on me to ...

630
01:03:14,901 --> 01:03:17,968
buy an incredible amount of Argentine paper

631
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:23,200
At that time I was thinking
it was the best thing to do.

632
01:03:23,801 --> 01:03:27,801
I knew that if I was successful
we would make so much money

633
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:30,600
that I would be king of the bank.

634
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:35,901
How could you make so much money
 if the country could not repay its debt?

635
01:03:36,067 --> 01:03:37,367
Well ...

636
01:03:38,100 --> 01:03:42,367
You buy the debt from the original lender
at ten cents on the dollar

637
01:03:42,601 --> 01:03:48,001
and then, afterwards, you sue the
government to repay to loan at face value.

638
01:03:48,501 --> 01:03:49,968
I see ...

639
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,801
Well, what happened?

640
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:56,801
At the time I was so caught up
in the gamble,

641
01:03:57,200 --> 01:04:01,001
and I was "Master of the Universe",

642
01:04:01,300 --> 01:04:07,300
that I continued to buy
without authorization,

643
01:04:08,200 --> 01:04:10,600
signing the papers myself,

644
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:13,600
even after the bank had
stopped the project.

645
01:04:18,300 --> 01:04:22,700
So, how come you didn't make so much money?

646
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:24,700
Well ...

647
01:04:26,100 --> 01:04:28,100
the wrong guy was elected.

648
01:04:29,300 --> 01:04:31,500
Depends for who.

649
01:04:34,100 --> 01:04:35,767
Maybe.

650
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:40,801
He decided not to repay the debt.

651
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:44,200
Never happened before..

652
01:04:46,901 --> 01:04:50,301
Wasn't it the best thing he could do
for his country?

653
01:04:53,601 --> 01:04:58,601
I think I understand why you have come
to hate this country so much.

654
01:05:00,100 --> 01:05:03,767
My parents' death was a real turning point for me.

655
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:08,801
I made me open my eyes and wonder why.

656
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:14,600
Why all these violence, why
all these deaths, all these misery.

657
01:05:16,501 --> 01:05:20,768
I'm going to go get some fresh air.
- You're OK?

658
01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:23,500
Yeah ...

659
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:42,701
You don't sleep much, do you?
- Not any more.

660
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:44,801
I'm late.

661
01:05:49,100 --> 01:05:50,667
I was too sure..

662
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:13,301
How are you feeling?

663
01:06:14,300 --> 01:06:15,967
Right now?

664
01:06:16,300 --> 01:06:19,700
Feeling like I want to watch you shower.

665
01:06:22,100 --> 01:06:23,634
Go on.

666
01:06:25,801 --> 01:06:31,468
And according to Professor Now, I don't
have to hide the fact that that excites me.

667
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:34,201
Of course not.

668
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:37,001
It's a pleasure for you to get excited.

669
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:40,101
It's a pleasure for me
to see you get excited.

670
01:06:40,300 --> 01:06:45,567
You can masturbate, if you want.
- I think I'd prefer to be inside you.

671
01:09:40,501 --> 01:09:43,402
Wait ... wait for me, wait.

672
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:32,701
Oh ... thank you.

673
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:35,667
Thank you.

674
01:10:36,300 --> 01:10:39,500
That was great ... great.

675
01:10:44,434 --> 01:10:47,501
Oh God, I have to go. I have to go.

676
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:50,400
It is crazy at the clinic.

677
01:10:51,100 --> 01:10:53,767
I hope they pay you

678
01:10:55,200 --> 01:10:58,600
You're funny! You think I am paid?

679
01:10:58,741 --> 01:11:00,242
What? You're not?

680
01:11:01,067 --> 01:11:02,467
With what?

681
01:11:02,901 --> 01:11:05,702
Why do you think these people are paying?

682
01:11:05,901 --> 01:11:07,901
What about the doctors?

683
01:11:10,200 --> 01:11:15,001
Same. Everybody who works there
is a volunteer.

684
01:11:15,300 --> 01:11:17,367
Are they real doctors?

685
01:11:17,801 --> 01:11:19,801
O Madre!

686
01:11:21,601 --> 01:11:24,335
Everybody who works there has a diploma.

687
01:11:24,601 --> 01:11:26,601
Yeah? What about you?

688
01:11:28,901 --> 01:11:30,568
Yeah, me too.

689
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:33,600
I have my nurse's degree.

690
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:35,300
I know.

691
01:11:35,400 --> 01:11:39,500
I know it's hard for you people to
understand wanting to go to work every day.

692
01:11:39,601 --> 01:11:42,801
Even Saturday, without pay.

693
01:11:43,300 --> 01:11:47,801
You're right. It's another world.

694
01:11:51,501 --> 01:11:53,035
I have to go.

695
01:12:51,601 --> 01:12:53,001
See?

696
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:16,701
Just a minute.

697
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:20,001
What are you doing here?

698
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:23,101
Well, I'm very sick, doctor.
I think my appendix is inflamed.

699
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:25,800
Very stupid for you to come here.

700
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:30,400
Who told you where I was?
- Luis.

701
01:13:30,868 --> 01:13:36,369
Look. I don't want to bother you. I just want to
stay here for a while and watch you ...

702
01:13:36,767 --> 01:13:39,767
and learn. If I'm bothering you,
I can leave

703
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:45,400
You'd do better to watch them.
You'll learn faster.

704
01:13:51,067 --> 01:13:54,668
I think you might be a little on the
wrong track, Mr. Later.

705
01:13:55,200 --> 01:13:59,600
Is there any such thing as the right track, Professor Now?

706
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:03,800
Good ... good answer.

707
01:14:30,968 --> 01:14:34,635
So, did you learn anything today?
- Well, I prefer the private session.

708
01:14:35,868 --> 01:14:37,669
Oh, my God!

709
01:14:38,200 --> 01:14:40,001
You scared me!

710
01:14:40,200 --> 01:14:44,600
I didn't know you were back!
- I just wanted to see you.

711
01:14:50,501 --> 01:14:51,901
I'll come back later,
if you're going to be here.

712
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:55,001
It's just like friends, Diego.

713
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:59,467
This is my student, "Later".

714
01:15:01,200 --> 01:15:04,600
Later?
- Later. Hi, Diego.

715
01:15:06,200 --> 01:15:08,200
I never knew you were teaching, too.

716
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:12,001
Yeah, she's a wonderful teacher.
- A-ha ...

717
01:15:12,300 --> 01:15:13,967
Teaching what?

718
01:15:15,300 --> 01:15:18,101
Life rescue.
- Really?

719
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:20,534
Interesting.

720
01:15:23,501 --> 01:15:26,968
It's hot here.

721
01:15:35,300 --> 01:15:37,700
Ah ... I'm going to go ...

722
01:15:37,901 --> 01:15:39,802
Oh, no, no, no, please stay.

723
01:15:39,901 --> 01:15:43,702
I ... just came bye to say "hi."

724
01:15:44,200 --> 01:15:46,667
I'm in between two planes.

725
01:15:46,901 --> 01:15:49,168
I can't believe it. You're leaving again?

726
01:15:49,300 --> 01:15:50,500
Well ...

727
01:15:51,067 --> 01:15:54,734
Diego is a reporter.
Always going around the world.

728
01:15:55,100 --> 01:15:59,901
Just got back from Pakistan.
Where the fuck are you going now?

729
01:16:00,601 --> 01:16:02,001
Congo.

730
01:16:29,200 --> 01:16:31,001
Don't go.

731
01:16:31,200 --> 01:16:37,001
Come dance with me. - No, it's OK. I'm just
gonna go outside and get some fresh air.

732
01:16:55,400 --> 01:16:56,600
Hey!

733
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:03,400
I don't want you to be upset.

734
01:17:04,200 --> 01:17:06,001
I'm not.

735
01:17:07,200 --> 01:17:09,267
Diego is a love of mine ...

736
01:17:09,501 --> 01:17:11,402
and I miss him.

737
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:14,001
It's OK.

738
01:17:15,100 --> 01:17:17,001
You don't owe me anything.

739
01:17:17,200 --> 01:17:19,400
It's me that owes you.

740
01:17:21,200 --> 01:17:24,400
Enjoy your time with him.
I can go, if you want.

741
01:17:25,300 --> 01:17:26,967
Of course not.

742
01:17:27,400 --> 01:17:29,201
He has to go.

743
01:17:30,200 --> 01:17:36,001
I just want to spend a little time
with him, and then I'm going to take him
to the airport with Luis' car.

744
01:17:37,200 --> 01:17:38,734
OK.

745
01:17:39,200 --> 01:17:41,001
I'll be here.

746
01:19:03,601 --> 01:19:05,001
What?

747
01:19:08,100 --> 01:19:11,100
Nothing. Never mind.

748
01:19:12,200 --> 01:19:15,101
Come with me.
- What? Where?

749
01:19:15,300 --> 01:19:17,201
To the bedroom.

750
01:19:18,100 --> 01:19:20,001
I spoke with Diego.

751
01:19:20,200 --> 01:19:24,600
I want you to be a part
of this too. - Well thank you both,
very much, but I'm afraid ...

752
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
I can't do that.

753
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:32,400
I'm still this dumb American who freaks out when
he hears his lover having sex with someone else.

754
01:19:33,634 --> 01:19:35,034
I'm sorry.

755
01:19:35,968 --> 01:19:38,569
I just missed him a lot.

756
01:19:39,200 --> 01:19:41,101
Come on now.

757
01:19:41,200 --> 01:19:43,101
I can't .. I can't do that.

758
01:19:43,200 --> 01:19:45,200
It would just be for a minute.

759
01:19:45,501 --> 01:19:47,501
He has to go anyway.

760
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:51,600
Do it for me ... if nothing else.

761
01:19:55,100 --> 01:19:58,100
Oh God, I thought you were
never going to come back

762
01:19:58,200 --> 01:20:01,001
Sorry man, I had to bribe him.

763
01:20:08,801 --> 01:20:11,801
I ... I'm not really ...

764
01:20:13,701 --> 01:20:15,768
We don't want to hear it.

765
01:20:16,701 --> 01:20:19,701
Just let Now be in charge.

766
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:21,667
Who is "Now"?

767
01:20:23,300 --> 01:20:25,700
A friend of his.

768
01:20:26,200 --> 01:20:27,400
What the ... ?

769
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:33,600
Listen, my friend. Enjoy.

770
01:20:33,901 --> 01:20:35,901
OK? I prefer women ...

771
01:20:36,200 --> 01:20:38,600
but I've been known to experiment.

772
01:20:47,200 --> 01:20:48,734
Salud.

773
01:20:53,801 --> 01:20:55,101
And ...

774
01:20:56,200 --> 01:20:58,667
when there's a beautiful woman on top ...

775
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:30,367
Does this excite you, Darling?

776
01:21:31,200 --> 01:21:33,001
Too many in bed?

777
01:21:35,200 --> 01:21:37,001
what a question ...

778
01:21:42,200 --> 01:21:44,267
But it's more than that.

779
01:21:48,200 --> 01:21:50,200
That sounds nice to me.

780
01:22:19,300 --> 01:22:20,901
Come with us.

781
01:22:25,200 --> 01:22:27,101
That would be nice.

782
01:23:13,100 --> 01:23:15,100
Not bad for a student.

783
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:18,800
And he clearly likes it.

784
01:23:26,200 --> 01:23:28,200
I'm sorry ...

785
01:23:32,200 --> 01:23:33,834
I can't.

786
01:24:08,501 --> 01:24:09,901
Hi.

787
01:24:11,200 --> 01:24:13,200
It finally cooled off.

788
01:24:16,300 --> 01:24:19,967
I thought for tonight I'd do something special.

789
01:24:22,901 --> 01:24:25,368
I stopped at an Italian tratoria.

790
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:29,600
The menu is Italian antipasti and Lambrusco.

791
01:24:34,100 --> 01:24:35,901
You were reading ... ?

792
01:24:36,200 --> 01:24:39,600
No, not really.

793
01:24:40,200 --> 01:24:42,600
I picked it up
 when I saw you coming.

794
01:24:42,801 --> 01:24:44,602
It looks better.

795
01:24:53,467 --> 01:24:55,068
Come on.

796
01:25:16,300 --> 01:25:19,101
How was your time alone?

797
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:23,834
OK, I guess.

798
01:25:25,200 --> 01:25:28,867
I was ... thinking, of course.

799
01:25:29,200 --> 01:25:31,001
What were you thinking about?

800
01:25:32,300 --> 01:25:34,300
I'm leaving tomorrow ...

801
01:25:36,200 --> 01:25:37,600
this morning.

802
01:25:43,234 --> 01:25:46,434
You could stay longer, if you want to.

803
01:25:50,200 --> 01:25:52,600
I think Professor Now is right.

804
01:25:53,200 --> 01:25:55,600
I have a whole new life to start.

805
01:25:56,200 --> 01:26:01,701
Besides, we know that only foolish students
fall in love with their professors.

806
01:26:05,200 --> 01:26:06,500
Well ...

807
01:26:06,801 --> 01:26:08,702
you know ...

808
01:26:09,400 --> 01:26:13,500
you leaving this morning will be
as hard for me as it is for you.

809
01:26:14,801 --> 01:26:19,201
Don't forget, that for me, too,
love is the most important feeling.

810
01:26:21,601 --> 01:26:24,868
It's the only one which redeems mankind.

811
01:26:26,767 --> 01:26:29,834
Do you love him?
- Who?

812
01:26:34,200 --> 01:26:35,600
Yeah ...

813
01:26:36,300 --> 01:26:37,600
Yeah ...

814
01:26:39,200 --> 01:26:42,400
But you have to understand.
I'm not like you.

815
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:46,400
Saying that I love him does not mean
that I don't love you ...

816
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,200
or that I love you any less.

817
01:26:51,200 --> 01:26:53,001
So you believe in ...

818
01:26:53,200 --> 01:26:54,734
free love?

819
01:26:55,200 --> 01:26:58,667
Yeah, of course I do.

820
01:27:00,100 --> 01:27:02,500
Free love is the only true love.

821
01:27:03,901 --> 01:27:08,301
It's the love you keep on testing
with others, and the love which endures.

822
01:27:09,300 --> 01:27:12,967
That is the only form of love
which liberates the ones who live it ...

823
01:27:13,200 --> 01:27:17,200
rather than limiting their freedom.

824
01:27:19,501 --> 01:27:21,901
You're a dreamer.

825
01:27:23,200 --> 01:27:25,400
But I'm not the only one.

826
01:27:31,567 --> 01:27:33,435
What can I do for you?

827
01:27:33,634 --> 01:27:35,435
Remember last night?

828
01:27:41,300 --> 01:27:42,867
Don't worry.

829
01:27:43,200 --> 01:27:46,600
I spent the last twenty years
taking care of my desires. - No ...

830
01:27:46,901 --> 01:27:48,702
It's my turn.

831
01:27:49,200 --> 01:27:50,667
Please.

832
01:27:54,501 --> 01:27:56,068
Kiss me.

833
01:31:41,200 --> 01:31:43,200
Isn't it beautiful?

834
01:31:50,200 --> 01:31:53,101
You know the most precious gift
you gave me?

835
01:31:53,901 --> 01:31:55,368
Anal sex?

836
01:31:59,634 --> 01:32:01,034
No ...

837
01:32:03,100 --> 01:32:05,100
You gave me strength.

838
01:32:06,200 --> 01:32:09,667
I mean, here I am ...
a fugitive ...

839
01:32:10,200 --> 01:32:12,801
seeing my country for the last time.

840
01:32:14,200 --> 01:32:15,767
Going to ...

841
01:32:16,200 --> 01:32:20,200
leave the only person I have in my life ...

842
01:32:21,200 --> 01:32:26,333
going to a place where I don't speak
the language, no money, no connections.

843
01:32:26,601 --> 01:32:29,001
I think I'll be freakin' out.

844
01:32:31,200 --> 01:32:32,667
You're not?

845
01:33:13,400 --> 01:33:17,533
Can I wear this? It smells like you.

846
01:33:18,100 --> 01:33:20,567
Sure, if you think it can help.

847
01:33:21,200 --> 01:33:23,200
I know it will.

848
01:33:26,200 --> 01:33:28,400
I hope it smells like you for a long time.

849
01:33:32,200 --> 01:33:34,200
If you make it to Nicaragua, ...

850
01:33:34,400 --> 01:33:36,400
call that number.

851
01:33:36,801 --> 01:33:40,702
He's a dear friend of mine.
You'll like him.

852
01:33:42,200 --> 01:33:44,001
Another lover.

853
01:33:46,200 --> 01:33:48,267
And this will help, too.

854
01:33:49,200 --> 01:33:53,001
No, thanks. I'm not taking your money

855
01:33:53,200 --> 01:33:58,001
I understand. But you're going to be back
in a harsh reality soon,
and everything has a price.

856
01:33:58,100 --> 01:34:00,001
I know, I know ...

857
01:34:00,200 --> 01:34:03,467
but it's my problem,
and I will deal with it.

858
01:34:57,100 --> 01:35:00,567
I think I should go on alone now.

859
01:35:01,200 --> 01:35:02,834
And you go.

860
01:35:04,100 --> 01:35:06,901
There are other people
in desperate need of help.

861
01:35:08,501 --> 01:35:10,768
The truck will stop three blocks down.

862
01:35:13,100 --> 01:35:15,701
The driver will be with Luis.

863
01:35:16,200 --> 01:35:17,767
He'll see you.

864
01:35:19,200 --> 01:35:21,267
Thank you for ...

865
01:35:28,200 --> 01:35:31,400
I wrote the restaurant address
in the inside.

866
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,067
Write me every time you cross the border.

867
01:35:35,300 --> 01:35:36,867
I will.

868
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:42,534
It's a long read, but you'll have the time
to read it and re-read it.

869
01:35:43,100 --> 01:35:46,901
Remember, to exist is the only thing that matters ...

870
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:49,801
to exist here and now ...

871
01:35:50,501 --> 01:35:52,501
and nothing else.
