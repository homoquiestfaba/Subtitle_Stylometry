1
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,916
<i>Everybody has two families:
The stable family,</i>

2
00:00:26,916 --> 00:00:28,505
<i>we pretend to have</i>

3
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,200
<i>and then there's the real people
we are related to.</i>

4
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:35,880
<i>My best friend Kenny says stable
family's makes boring children.</i>

5
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,258
<i>And by stable families, I think
he means the kind where mum,</i>

6
00:00:41,284 --> 00:00:44,625
<i>and dad and kids all living in
the same house all the time.</i>

7
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,640
<i>And by boring,
he means not as cool as we are.</i>

8
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:01,920
Still and undisputed,
universal master of the jungle gym.

9
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,695
I'm getting too old for the
super sonic death spiral.

10
00:01:04,696 --> 00:01:07,425
Lucy, play is the great educator.

11
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,621
Alright, it's sole
purpose is to prepare

12
00:01:09,647 --> 00:01:11,265
juvenile animals for adulthood.

13
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:14,160
It's not play if you puked
your guts out.

14
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,600
Hey, when you say's your
dad was going to be home?

15
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,880
I guess I'll see your in a week then.

16
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:28,800
Hey, I'm not going to ditch you
just 'cause my dad's home.

17
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,672
Lucy. It's fine... just go.

18
00:01:30,673 --> 00:01:32,780
- It's fine... I'm cool here.
- Yeah?

19
00:01:32,781 --> 00:01:35,090
- You go!
- Okay!

20
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:50,195
<i>Mom says she fell in love
with dad because he was fun</i>

21
00:01:50,196 --> 00:01:53,945
<i>and goofy and everything felt
bigger when he is around.</i>

22
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,920
<i>And he's still that way.</i>

23
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:00,480
<i>Except since dad's a lumberjack, he's
only home four or five times a year.</i>

24
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,000
<i>When dad's here,
we stopped everything.</i>

25
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:07,160
<i>Mom stays home, I skips school,
it's like a vacation.</i>

26
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,066
<i>I don't know when
I first started to notice</i>

27
00:02:09,067 --> 00:02:12,265
<i>the argument my parents
weren't having.</i>

28
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,400
Hey, let's go out for breakfast.

29
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,076
I'm not a kid anymore.
I won't help you.

30
00:02:35,077 --> 00:02:37,745
Yeah, you are. And yeah you'll...
Come on!

31
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,360
- We're lucky your dad has a job.
- You always say that.

32
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,788
We're all doing the best we can.

33
00:02:51,814 --> 00:02:54,745
Is lying to dad about your
job doing the best we can?

34
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,480
He's out there working his butt off to
support us. You'll hurt his feelings.

35
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:06,240
So, should I lie to you about what
I'm doing to protect your feelings?

36
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,103
I'm surprised that you didn't
get warned already

37
00:03:08,129 --> 00:03:12,585
I would. I'd did anything interesting
I would actually lied about.

38
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,120
Don't worry honey, you will!
Just give it time.

39
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,146
<i>Mom pretends she doesn't have
a job when dad's here.</i>

40
00:03:25,147 --> 00:03:29,145
<i>She says it's because dad kind of
old school about family roles.</i>

41
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:33,617
<i>If you asked me,
it's kind of lame that her</i>

42
00:03:33,643 --> 00:03:36,305
<i>secret identity is
being a tele-marketer.</i>

43
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,520
- Mom? What?
- Straight home.

44
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,784
I don't even have my license yet.

45
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:51,745
Oh! You're a natural. I mean, think
of all the kids you know with license.

46
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:55,720
Is there any of them more capable
than you? It'll be fun.

47
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,840
Wait! How are you going to get home?

48
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:05,160
If I can't find a ride in this
outfits, I deserved to walk.

49
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,238
So you're saying she isn't that great?

50
00:04:32,239 --> 00:04:34,484
No, Scott! I'm saying you
don't have to say it out

51
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:36,610
loud each random thought
that you have.

52
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,750
I bet you she's really great.
You can always tell

53
00:04:38,751 --> 00:04:41,865
the ones that are gonna
be dirty freaky sluts.

54
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,760
Oh yeah... Juicy Lucy.
Ooh... you like that. Ooh yeah!

55
00:04:48,149 --> 00:04:49,374
- Huh!
- Shit!

56
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,610
Ooh... yeah.

57
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,560
- Sorry.
- You're dead, Kenny.

58
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,727
You're... you're totally dead.

59
00:04:58,730 --> 00:04:59,828
- You're deader than death!
- Hey!

60
00:04:59,842 --> 00:05:01,070
- Hey!
- You're gonna wish you were dead.

61
00:05:01,071 --> 00:05:02,232
I saw your dad leave this morning.

62
00:05:02,233 --> 00:05:04,345
I'll tear your guts out and
feed them to the rats.

63
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,944
I'll ripped your head off and
pissed down the hole.

64
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:08,992
I'll bet if he didn't manually
decapitated you,

65
00:05:08,993 --> 00:05:11,252
and position your body in just
the right angle,

66
00:05:11,254 --> 00:05:12,555
- I'll bet he still couldn't
- You're gonna wish you were dead.

67
00:05:12,556 --> 00:05:14,719
get a stream of urine going.

68
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,560
- Yuck it up, dead boy.
- Hey Scott, what if I kiss you?

69
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:22,720
For real! Would you leave Kenny alone?

70
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,680
- Yeah.
- Lucy, what are you doing?

71
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,720
Lucy. Come on, Lucy.

72
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,280
So you promised you won't hurt Kenny?

73
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,200
You're a terrible kisser.

74
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,800
What the hell? Who would want
to deal with you anyway.

75
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,015
I believe you're our
greatest resource,

76
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:17,185
and so to that end we planned
to invest in you.

77
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:21,188
I'm happy to introduce to you
one of the top tele-marketing

78
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:24,305
performing coaches in the state,
Guy Carlsberg.

79
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:30,440
At the very based of our
life is meaning.

80
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,800
And this meaning provides direction.

81
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:40,360
All of our actions are driven by
our most basic believes.

82
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:45,747
It's this base of meaning,
that prevents us from

83
00:06:45,748 --> 00:06:48,225
drifting through an empty
existence at work, at home

84
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,480
and in our relationships...

85
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,520
Really in all aspects of our lives.

86
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,859
I can't believe I almost make it to

87
00:07:01,885 --> 00:07:03,865
sixteen without seriously
kissing anyone.

88
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,600
And then the first one is
Scott Booker.

89
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,645
No memories is malleable.

90
00:07:11,671 --> 00:07:14,585
What has that have to do with Scott
trying to lick the back of my throat?

91
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,405
It means that,
every time you tell a story,

92
00:07:18,406 --> 00:07:22,479
it changes a little bit in
your memories, so...

93
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:25,304
you could say that I was your
first kiss, and then after awhile,

94
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:27,905
it would be kind of
like Scott never happens.

95
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,520
Kenny, I still got dirt in my mouth.

96
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,840
Oh yuck, I know. You wouldn't have to
actually kiss me, I'm just saying.

97
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,400
I'm thinking of shaving my head.

98
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,796
Well, you'll probably
look pretty cool.

99
00:07:47,822 --> 00:07:49,585
I don't want to look cool.

100
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,120
You would have to kiss me.

101
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
- What?
- To change the memory thing.

102
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,360
You have to do it!

103
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,880
Okay!

104
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,534
<i>So of course when you start
your soffritto</i>

105
00:08:27,535 --> 00:08:29,077
<i>what's really important
is to remember that</i>

106
00:08:29,078 --> 00:08:32,039
<i>you're only as good as
your pantry ingredients.</i>

107
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:34,935
<i>Now there's always in my word,
two different kind of olive's oil.</i>

108
00:08:34,936 --> 00:08:38,168
<i>The one that I cook with, keep in
mind that there are both extra virgin.</i>

109
00:08:38,193 --> 00:08:39,563
<i>One that I cook with,</i>

110
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:44,320
<i>and one that I finished with.
The difference is about 30 bucks.</i>

111
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,201
<i>Then you gotta evaluate your
entire pantry ingredients.</i>

112
00:08:47,202 --> 00:08:49,728
<i>I'm adding a little sea salt.
Sea salt from Triponey.</i>

113
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:52,966
<i>Now, so I also like to use a
little bit of extra... to finish with.</i>

114
00:08:52,969 --> 00:08:55,560
<i>Now this is...
there are both from a single....</i>

115
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,939
You know the bad gal always
sit in the back of the class.

116
00:09:02,965 --> 00:09:04,745
What, you're calling me bad?

117
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:11,314
I'm back to boring kids with a
stable families,

118
00:09:11,315 --> 00:09:14,865
don't have the beautiful mom who
goes to work in stripper heels.

119
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,720
Bye, thank you!

120
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,520
Hey!

121
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,480
- Missing your dad?
- Yeah!

122
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:42,914
<i>So now, we've got our
condiments going.</i>

123
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:44,489
<i>We've got our noodles in the water...</i>

124
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:46,321
We had a seminary thingy
at work today.

125
00:09:46,322 --> 00:09:50,759
Turns out I'm drifting through an
empty meaningless existence.

126
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,480
See... I tried to tell you.

127
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,560
- How's the show always on?
- I record it.

128
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:09,680
I've kissed two boys today.
So I probably ruined my whole life.

129
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,840
- With the tongue?
- What?

130
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,920
No, it's gross!

131
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:22,320
Well, then you're probably
not ruined quite yet.

132
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,000
- Do you want to go down to the river?
- We could.

133
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,640
Could if you want.

134
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,400
It's not like we did anything wrong.

135
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,168
Yeah! I know.

136
00:10:52,194 --> 00:10:55,265
Okay! So don't say stuff like
we could if we want.

137
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:58,720
What kind of way is that
to talk to me.

138
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,360
Holy shit!

139
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:11,442
Okay...

140
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,640
This one I'm gonna remember.

141
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,360
Kenny?

142
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,240
I think I've just given him a seizure.

143
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:12,080
<i>Okay, so now the calamari is
perfectly tender...</i>

144
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:19,120
Kenny... are you epileptic?

145
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:26,318
Chicken Caesar... yeah. You're
gonna have to dress it yourself.

146
00:12:26,344 --> 00:12:29,345
If I dressed it now, the leaves
will turn all soggy by lunch time.

147
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,240
I expect you to cultivate a deeper
basic meaning in your own life.

148
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,840
Okay, you're using actual
english words that I recognised

149
00:12:34,866 --> 00:12:37,385
but I've no idea what you're saying.

150
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,809
I don't want you to end up like me.

151
00:12:39,835 --> 00:12:43,585
Mom, that has always been
one of my life ambitions.

152
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,982
Okay! Good girl.

153
00:12:45,983 --> 00:12:48,359
- I love you.
- Go!

154
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,240
I'll see you later.

155
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,815
Hello Miss Burgenham.
My name is Lainee

156
00:12:55,841 --> 00:12:57,865
calling on behalf of
Premier Interworks.

157
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:03,800
Goddamn it. I'm on the federal no-call
list. Get a new job, you loser.

158
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,840
Alright, let me hear what
you guys got.

159
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:18,929
<i>They're restructuring our
work schedule...</i>

160
00:13:18,955 --> 00:13:21,625
<i>- ... because of the nature...</i>
- Overtime on a Sunday?

161
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,400
<i>- I won't be late, I promised.</i>
- Mom, I made a pork and lamb ragu!

162
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,399
<i>- More people are home on weekend.</i>
- Yeah, okay.

163
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:30,759
<i>You know it made more sense to call.
I'm really, really sorry, Lucy.</i>

164
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:33,019
- Yeah, me too.
<i>- Okay, bye!</i>

165
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:33,712
Okay!

166
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:40,920
Hey, want to stay for dinner?

167
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:45,840
- I can't.
- Please?

168
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,667
You know, my mom don't
just like to eat alone.

169
00:13:48,668 --> 00:13:50,785
Go invite her over!

170
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,080
Why? Are you ashamed of
me or something?

171
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,360
I'll give you some sauce to take home.

172
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,080
I wish my dad were here.

173
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:26,848
You know how I say about dreaming big?

174
00:14:26,874 --> 00:14:27,785
Yeah?

175
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:34,080
Well, my bigger life... I get to eat
dinner with you every single night.

176
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:39,520
I'm gonna cook you the most
amazing meals.

177
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:03,025
<i>So, the pen-ay is just about 30 seconds
left to being perfectly cooked.</i>

178
00:15:03,051 --> 00:15:05,745
<i>What you want to do at
that point is take it out.</i>

179
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:10,680
<i>Maybe if I found dad a job here,
we could be a real family.</i>

180
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:15,040
<i>Mom would have to quit working.
Everything would be perfect.</i>

181
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:34,560
I lost my parents at 16.
And there is my boyfriend, Ron.

182
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:38,120
And Chuck.... I mean my husband.

183
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:41,320
And I had Lucy at seventeen.

184
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,040
I was pretty much a total mess.

185
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,995
You probably hear this all
the time but

186
00:15:50,021 --> 00:15:53,585
you beat me,
see myself on this floor.

187
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:59,520
It's so much lost at such a early age.

188
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:05,200
A lonely heart heal at their own pace.

189
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,721
Is this something I'm gonna
need to lie about?

190
00:16:44,747 --> 00:16:46,865
Lucy, what're you doing?

191
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,739
What am I doing? It is 5 am.

192
00:16:49,765 --> 00:16:51,745
I'm sorry, Lucy. I should have call.

193
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,166
I fell asleep at my desk.

194
00:16:54,192 --> 00:16:56,865
And where were you
calling, Uzbekistan?

195
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:59,339
I just came home to shower,
and changed clothes

196
00:16:59,365 --> 00:17:01,505
and straight back to work and start
the whole thing all over again.

197
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:04,720
And that's the best you can do?
I fell asleep at my desk.

198
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,860
You know what...
it's been a long night.

199
00:17:06,886 --> 00:17:09,345
Yeah! It's been a long night here too.

200
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:23,520
Nice clogs.

201
00:17:23,546 --> 00:17:27,225
Nice transsexual
beauty queen costumes.

202
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,851
- You know school back's today.
- I knew about it.

203
00:17:30,877 --> 00:17:31,720
I was just checking.

204
00:17:31,721 --> 00:17:33,479
I didn't know how
much you've forgotten

205
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,050
about your alleged family life.

206
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,800
Well, have a great day, honey... okay!
I'll be back home early tonight.

207
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,440
Are you going need to be
congratulate for that?

208
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:59,340
Alright, just remember...
no sexual energy. Okay... I mean...

209
00:17:59,341 --> 00:18:01,752
if these people even sense we're
going out, we'd be pretty shit!

210
00:18:01,778 --> 00:18:02,825
We are going out?

211
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,664
I don't... I means... I don't know...
I mean like...

212
00:18:06,665 --> 00:18:09,345
What? Because of all the massive
spring break weekends with you.

213
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:14,520
- Yeah, because of that!
- It was 100 percent platonic.

214
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:20,055
Just become invisible. Tried to keep
your animal desires under wraps.

215
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:22,920
Ooh... it'll be a tremendous struggle.

216
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,485
We were just this trained poodles
jumping through hoops.

217
00:18:29,511 --> 00:18:31,677
High school is not intended to
challenge our intellect.

218
00:18:31,703 --> 00:18:34,210
It doesn't even prepared us
for anything real in life.

219
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,965
I mean what?  After 4 years of
poodle training we graduate,

220
00:18:37,966 --> 00:18:39,355
and if we're really lucky

221
00:18:39,356 --> 00:18:42,284
ours parents get to spend thousands
of dollars of 4 more years

222
00:18:42,285 --> 00:18:43,937
- of higher education...
- Hey... what's up, Lucy.

223
00:18:44,684 --> 00:18:45,745
Hi!

224
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,755
Where have you been?
I never see you out or anything.

225
00:18:47,756 --> 00:18:50,025
There's a party after
the game on Friday.

226
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,430
I don't go to parties.

227
00:18:52,336 --> 00:18:54,585
You should definitely
start going to parties.

228
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,800
I'll text you the address.
See you there.

229
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,953
How can you go off
about poodle theory,

230
00:19:03,954 --> 00:19:06,305
when you were just straight A 4.0.

231
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,315
How does Justin Haven
have your cell number?

232
00:19:08,341 --> 00:19:10,145
I don't know.

233
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,480
I don't even know he knows my name.

234
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,518
I don't get a 4.0

235
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:16,705
- if I'm always be in something.
- Why?

236
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:20,800
- I need the power.
- That's very gangster of you.

237
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,991
We're doom.
You're too beautiful to be invisible.

238
00:19:24,017 --> 00:19:25,385
Please don't say that!

239
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,508
Beautiful people are
shallow and self-absorbed.

240
00:19:27,509 --> 00:19:30,785
And come on... they never grow up.

241
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,440
Aah geez... Kenny!

242
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:49,200
- So you're looking for a job?
- Maybe.

243
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,920
Don't you think you've a shot at
General Contractor?

244
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,480
Just taking a look at what's
out there.

245
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,720
- How was school?
- The same.

246
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,913
Our seminar thing was
about pride today.

247
00:20:09,914 --> 00:20:12,225
Go figure!

248
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:16,840
You're gonna take pride in
you know... raising you.

249
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,807
I don't have much
credit that I can take

250
00:20:18,808 --> 00:20:20,523
but I'm really proud of who you are.

251
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,485
What's the deal with hand jobs? How do
you know if you're doing the right...

252
00:20:24,486 --> 00:20:26,505
Lucy, please. I'm sorry, okay!

253
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:32,188
Went to a party
Friday night with Kenny.

254
00:20:32,214 --> 00:20:34,145
Well, that sounds like fun.

255
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,428
Probably not.

256
00:20:36,382 --> 00:20:39,585
Don't you feel strong
parental avoidance based on one.

257
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,680
This is everything.

258
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,622
You know there are people who
actually lived back on high school

259
00:21:13,648 --> 00:21:15,665
as being the best of their lives.

260
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:20,400
- I'm fine.
- Hey, I knew you'd come.

261
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,720
- Kenny, right?
- Hey ya, Timmo.

262
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,941
Man, I thought the catcher
was going to cry after

263
00:21:27,942 --> 00:21:30,825
he miffed the tag at me on home plate.
- I know!

264
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,400
- You were amazing.
- I did it all for you.

265
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,280
We drinking here or what?

266
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:40,400
- Rage!
- Rage?

267
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,040
To rage!

268
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,304
It's like I was saying when
Brad called me,

269
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:53,865
don't be sneaking off on
the sophomores, man.

270
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:57,091
To Lucy Diamond. The hottest
bitch on North Central High.

271
00:21:57,117 --> 00:21:59,105
Hey, who you're calling a bitch?

272
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,200
She's adorable.

273
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,160
Make a hole. Vomit express!

274
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:11,760
- Kenny!
- He's fine.

275
00:22:11,786 --> 00:22:13,865
He's fine. He just needs a little air.

276
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:16,560
- Hey!
- What?

277
00:22:16,586 --> 00:22:18,385
Hey, you over delusional
sense of confidence.

278
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,240
Kenny!

279
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,640
Okay?

280
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,920
Can you please don't do that?

281
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:53,160
- I love you, Lucy. I do!
- Ooh Kenny... Kenny!

282
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:56,320
Kenny! You are not in love.
You're drunk.

283
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,080
Justin said that you're hot and
you love him now.

284
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:05,840
Justin is a meat-head. He is cute,
but dumb. He doesn't even get sarcasm.

285
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:09,360
- You know... you think he's cute.
No. I don't think he's cute. Come on!

286
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,765
No, I don't think he's cute.
You are so heavy.

287
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:15,480
Don't step in that, yeah!

288
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,840
<i> Hello! </ I>

289
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:54,751
Come here! There's my girl.
How're ya...

290
00:23:54,777 --> 00:23:56,811
- Make me a muscle.
- Dad!

291
00:23:56,812 --> 00:24:01,360
No more sign. I wanna be a chef.

292
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,560
All done being daddy's
little lumberjack, huh?

293
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:09,800
- Welcome home.
- So... What's happened?

294
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:13,931
So... you left March 12 at
eight fifteen. Mom and I went

295
00:24:13,932 --> 00:24:16,662
to the diner's. She got an omelet,
I had pancakes and they...

296
00:24:16,663 --> 00:24:19,280
- Yeah...okay, then what?
- I drove home!

297
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,798
- You drove home?
- Yeah!

298
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:21,803
In town?

299
00:24:21,804 --> 00:24:24,290
Well, mom told me to come straight
home, but I did go to the park.

300
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,668
Wait, mom let you drive alone?

301
00:24:25,669 --> 00:24:28,490
Dad, I was... I was just trying
to impress Kenny.

302
00:24:28,491 --> 00:24:30,664
And there was this other guy there
who made me kiss him, so...

303
00:24:31,145 --> 00:24:31,945
What!?

304
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,866
Some bitch-tarded assholian

305
00:24:33,892 --> 00:24:35,425
- made you kiss Kenny?
- No, dad!

306
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,771
Some skanky guy Scott and I had to.

307
00:24:37,797 --> 00:24:40,019
He was going to beat up
Kenny if I didn't...

308
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:42,156
- Scott! Scott who?
- Dad, it was nothing.

309
00:24:42,157 --> 00:24:44,090
It was just stupid
playground stuff and he...

310
00:24:44,091 --> 00:24:46,090
Alright... okay! Where was
the person formerly known as

311
00:24:46,116 --> 00:24:48,185
your mother when all this kissing
and driving was going on?

312
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,149
Dad! She was going to be late so

313
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:50,813
- I had to drop her off...
- Late? Late for what?

314
00:24:50,815 --> 00:24:53,260
- Good morning.
- Lainee... what the

315
00:24:53,286 --> 00:24:54,419
hell is going on?

316
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:02,205
I don't know what I was
thinking, Chuck.

317
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:04,625
- I just...
- Mom, I told him about the job.

318
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,520
A job?

319
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,515
<i>What do I need... Do you want
me to send more money?</i>

320
00:25:15,516 --> 00:25:17,511
<i>Are you having trouble
paying the bills?</i>

321
00:25:17,512 --> 00:25:19,810
<i>It's something to do, Chuck!</i>

322
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:22,579
<i>It's get really lonely.
What exactly do you</i>

323
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:24,025
<i>think I should be doing
when you're gone?</i>

324
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,485
<i>Pay attention to raising
your daughter.</i>

325
00:25:25,486 --> 00:25:29,665
<i>I have been raising our daughter
by myself for 16 years.</i>

326
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,360
Kenny?

327
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:04,800
- Lucy.
- I'm freezing. Move over.

328
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,680
Sorry. I'm sorry.

329
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,840
Lucy!

330
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:11,400
- You know I love you, don't you?
- That was sex, Kenny. Not love.

331
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:15,480
- Lucy, I'm serious.
- I gotta go!

332
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:22,200
Hello? Lucy?

333
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:26,120
<i>Kenny?</i>

334
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:33,320
<b>PLANNED PARENTHOOD</b>

335
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:50,280
<i> Lucy! You have got company.</i>

336
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:58,512
There was a really bad famine
in the 3rd century.

337
00:29:58,538 --> 00:30:02,665
These butcher, lured 3 little boys
into their shop,

338
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:06,280
murder them,
soaked them in a barrel of brim.

339
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:09,096
- It must have been a huge barrel.
- Why, chopped them up!

340
00:30:09,122 --> 00:30:11,265
He's been selling them as ham.

341
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:15,160
Then Saint Nicholas,
brought the little boys back to life.

342
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:17,680
Saint Nicholas like Santa Claus,
Saint Nicholas?

343
00:30:17,681 --> 00:30:19,665
Yeah, a lot of people don't
know that about.

344
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:25,000
I didn't. So what, they were like
little boy zombies or something?

345
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:27,003
Well, you really didn't believe
in Santa Elves, did you?

346
00:30:29,290 --> 00:30:31,345
- No... no, you gotta...
- I guess not, yeah.

347
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,800
- Hi.
- Hey.

348
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,363
Hey, I thought we should
get a head start on our homework

349
00:30:36,389 --> 00:30:38,585
so it's not hanging
over our head all weekends.

350
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:44,440
- Yeah. There's cookies inside.
- Yeah.

351
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:59,261
So, there's a pill you can take
to keep from getting pregnant.

352
00:30:59,262 --> 00:31:03,945
It's a emergency contraception plan B
pill. I got it at Planned Parenthood.

353
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,800
You went there?

354
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,001
So even in the spirit of Easter,

355
00:31:09,002 --> 00:31:11,609
you're saying bringing
people back from the dead

356
00:31:11,635 --> 00:31:13,850
is not such a good thing.

357
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:17,044
Well, I mean if it's a
full on miracle with no

358
00:31:17,045 --> 00:31:19,467
side effects like brain's damage,
or motor control,

359
00:31:19,468 --> 00:31:21,051
then yeah... it's a good thing but

360
00:31:21,052 --> 00:31:23,835
I think the grey area
of moralistically

361
00:31:23,836 --> 00:31:26,065
is in the quality of life
after resuscitation.

362
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:28,717
Sure! I get to smell like pickles.

363
00:31:28,718 --> 00:31:31,025
Right! See.... that's no good,
you know.

364
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:34,360
- I got that!
- Homework.

365
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,677
- Hello!
<i>- Chuck, this is Libby.</i>

366
00:31:37,678 --> 00:31:39,750
<i>Oh... hey, how're you doing?</i>

367
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:48,299
It's best to take the pill
before 72 hours from this morning.

368
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:49,638
I already took it.

369
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,282
I'll tell what.
I've got a better idea.

370
00:31:52,289 --> 00:31:54,253
Why don't you guys come
over here for brunch.

371
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:58,692
Yeah, Lucy always made
some mountain of food.

372
00:31:58,718 --> 00:32:00,459
They're like brother and
sister already, so...

373
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:02,905
- you know, we're already like family.
<i>- Okay!</i>

374
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,805
- 11 o'clock on Sunday?
<i>- Alright.</i>

375
00:32:04,806 --> 00:32:07,281
Fantastic! Alright, I'll see you then.

376
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:12,720
We're gonna have Easter brunch on
Sunday together. How great is that?

377
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:21,049
Did you know that I used to
babysit your mom?

378
00:32:21,075 --> 00:32:22,305
Of course she does.

379
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:23,786
Remember I told you
about the babysitter

380
00:32:23,787 --> 00:32:27,505
- who puked in our Jack janitor?
- Ooh, I forgot all that!

381
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,480
- And what you did... didn't you...
- What?

382
00:32:31,481 --> 00:32:33,918
give Lainee's cousin the
teething to wear

383
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:36,585
that you found in her mother
underwear's drawer?

384
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:39,636
I was 14. I had no idea
why the women were

385
00:32:39,662 --> 00:32:42,465
so upset and the men couldn't
stopped laughing.

386
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,143
It was a vibrator.

387
00:32:45,169 --> 00:32:48,425
Yeah, I got there on my own.
Thank you.

388
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:55,798
So then Lucy, winds up
having to kiss this

389
00:32:55,824 --> 00:32:59,025
shitdiculous kid Scott
something, Scott...

390
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,129
Booker.

391
00:33:00,130 --> 00:33:00,930
Scott Booker.

392
00:33:00,956 --> 00:33:03,890
Scott Booker. Scott mix smell ass
Booker. Yes!

393
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:07,273
Apparently to save Kenny
from getting a beating.

394
00:33:07,299 --> 00:33:09,905
See, that's completely unfair.

395
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,676
Hey, let's do that thing where
we all go round

396
00:33:12,677 --> 00:33:13,698
and say what we're thankful for.

397
00:33:13,699 --> 00:33:15,159
- All I'm saying what's unfair?
- At Thanksgiving...

398
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:18,149
Teenage boys have feelings too.
Did it occurred to you that

399
00:33:18,175 --> 00:33:21,025
Scott or Kenny might have been
embarrassed or upset by what happened?

400
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:24,040
I'll start... I am thankful
to live in a country...

401
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:27,840
I can tell you all about teenage boys
and their penis-centric feeling.

402
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:28,997
... nonfiction novel and

403
00:33:29,023 --> 00:33:30,177
- reality television.
- Ooh, that's such a

404
00:33:30,178 --> 00:33:32,344
stupid over generalization.

405
00:33:32,345 --> 00:33:34,720
I am thankful for the multi
Italiano cookbook which I got...

406
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:37,105
It's just as hard to be
a teenage boy as it is

407
00:33:37,131 --> 00:33:39,385
to be a teenage girl.
Isn't that right, Kenny?

408
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:43,230
As a former pregnant teenager,
I'd say it's way tougher being a girl.

409
00:33:43,231 --> 00:33:46,103
Lenny, I know you were
lost in your grief

410
00:33:46,104 --> 00:33:48,385
and your anger when your parents died.

411
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:51,655
And... and even Chuck dropped
out of High school.

412
00:33:51,656 --> 00:33:54,021
Everyone said he'd a chance
of playing college ball.

413
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:58,280
I don't want Kenny to have to give up
his life like Chuck did.

414
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:03,440
Kenny has just as much at risk in a
sexual relationship as Lucy does.

415
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,840
What the F...ing shit?

416
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:11,326
I think the issue isn't so much
who has a more difficult time,

417
00:34:11,327 --> 00:34:12,917
I think it's challenging for
all of us...

418
00:34:12,918 --> 00:34:14,320
- Maybe you didn't know?
- No, I don't.

419
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:17,034
I don't need you to tell me what
you think my daughter is doing...

420
00:34:17,035 --> 00:34:18,185
Nothing is being taught...

421
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,624
And I don't have to
standby and pretend

422
00:34:19,650 --> 00:34:21,330
that there's nothing I can
do about it.

423
00:34:21,331 --> 00:34:23,825
The real issue is how do we
hold society more accountable?

424
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,560
That's enough!

425
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:34,440
Are you making accusing against
our daughter? How dare you?

426
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:39,640
And I didn't give up my life.
My family is my life.

427
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,750
You know in the eastern religions
they... they believe that our entire

428
00:34:49,751 --> 00:34:52,945
life's were just an illusion and
none of this is actually real.

429
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:57,280
The Buddhists call it <i>samsara.</i>

430
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:00,240
Hey... hey!

431
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,880
Who's a good boy?

432
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:11,760
- What a <i>samsara</i> Easter.
- You know I didn't tell her anything.

433
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,200
I know.

434
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:19,360
Our parents are never to be
within 500 yards of each other.

435
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:22,360
That's absolutely imperatives.

436
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,761
I don't want to have sex again.

437
00:35:29,272 --> 00:35:30,913
It's not because of your mom
and my dad's.

438
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:36,440
I just want to wait till we're older.
- Okay.

439
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:43,200
That's it? Okay?

440
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,800
Hello, <i>Chica.</i>

441
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:50,120
Do you know how long we've
been doing this?

442
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:54,920
Easter leftovers feast for the dogs?
Since we were 8.

443
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:58,480
Right and we have been friends
since we were six.

444
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:02,880
That's 10 years, Lucy. You know, most
marriages don't even last that long.

445
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:05,880
I just want us to last.

446
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:16,240
I thought guy's was supposed to have
a sexual thought every 30 seconds?

447
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:20,560
I didn't say I wouldn't
think about it.

448
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:29,400
- Hey! No alcohol.
- Agreed, but...

449
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:32,777
You realised this make us
like totally abnormal, right?

450
00:36:32,803 --> 00:36:34,745
We could always take up smoking.

451
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:40,360
Yeah, or latexbondage.
I hear that's fun.

452
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,400
Scott?

453
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:59,840
Hey, Lucy. Look what I went and found.

454
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,520
Here you go.

455
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,600
Scott.

456
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:12,680
I was raised in
Saint Bartholomew orphanage.

457
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:15,437
And while I realised that
was a pretty strict

458
00:37:15,463 --> 00:37:18,345
upbringing and a different time...

459
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:22,491
We didn't force girl's to do
things back then.

460
00:37:24,106 --> 00:37:24,519
Yes, sir!

461
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,640
Dad, it wasn't even his idea.

462
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:28,924
Do you know what happened

463
00:37:28,925 --> 00:37:32,225
- to Saint Bartholomew?
- No, sir!

464
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:38,120
They took a knife and they
skinned his feet.

465
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:43,167
And he's alive. He's watching this
happened. Now, they just want

466
00:37:43,168 --> 00:37:45,625
1 big piece of skin. So, you know...

467
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:51,560
They're taking their time.
One long slice at the leg...

468
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:58,080
and they carefully peeled the skin
away from the muscle.

469
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:02,507
Now, most people die when they reached
the mid-section but Bartholomew,

470
00:38:02,533 --> 00:38:04,785
is one of the apostles.

471
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:09,280
He's still alive, even after they
skinned his face off his skull.

472
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:12,400
Dad... come on! There is no really...

473
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:16,480
Your apology should be so sincere,
that it breaks my heart.

474
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,080
I'm sorry.

475
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:29,480
I'm sorry, Lucy. I really didn't
mean it. I really am sorry.

476
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:35,280
Real men treat women with respect.

477
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:40,080
- Say it.
- Real men treat women with respect.

478
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:45,440
Have a good Easter, Scott.

479
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,640
Scott, I'm so...

480
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,220
- Scott was scared to dead.
I just need him to apologizes to Lucy.

481
00:38:58,246 --> 00:38:59,468
- Well, you'll be lucky if his family
- Seeing he's out driving around...

482
00:38:59,494 --> 00:39:00,890
doesn't pressed charges.

483
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:03,694
Oh please! You've your job now, right?

484
00:39:03,695 --> 00:39:05,585
So somebody had to make
time for parenting.

485
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:07,520
You call that parenting?

486
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,784
What... I'm not enough
to get jealous about anymore,

487
00:39:09,810 --> 00:39:11,745
you have to throw Lucy in too?

488
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,864
Anything I need to be jealous about?
Who should I be jealous about?

489
00:39:15,865 --> 00:39:19,225
Go cool off before you do
something really stupid.

490
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,600
Mom, are you okay?

491
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,760
Yeah, I'll be.

492
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:40,164
- Hello?
<i>- How's the hottest bitch</i>

493
00:39:40,165 --> 00:39:43,705
<i>- of North Central High.</i>
- Would you stop calling me that.

494
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:47,400
- Boy troubles?
- This jerk won't leave me alone.

495
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:50,080
Get used to it.

496
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:58,511
Hey sweetie. I just called work,
they're short a couple of guys.

497
00:39:58,946 --> 00:40:00,362
Can't even give this guy
some privacy.

498
00:40:00,388 --> 00:40:01,690
Same old... same old.

499
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,347
What... you're leaving?

500
00:40:08,373 --> 00:40:10,745
Yes, I just called work. They're short
of a couple of guys. I gotta go.

501
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:17,520
<i>Jesus... Chuck, you're lying.
You're lying right in my face.</i>

502
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:21,898
<i>Now I am the liar? I'm the one
that keeps us going, lady.</i>

503
00:40:21,924 --> 00:40:24,745
<i>You think you make enough with your
little job to pay for all this?</i>

504
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:30,320
<i>I'm leaving because I've to work.
Somebody have to work...</i>

505
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:37,840
<i>You know what? Go, just go then.
Run away...</i>

506
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:04,720
How is the hottest bitch of
North Central High?

507
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,560
<i>Building self-esteem is one thing,
but maintaining a high level esteem</i>

508
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:49,780
<i>required you incorporate 629</i>

509
00:41:49,806 --> 00:41:51,945
<i>into your life and make
them a habit for you.</i>

510
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:53,880
What a piece of shit!

511
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,280
- Hey.
- Hey.

512
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,965
<i>So you want to add a
little bit herbal and...</i>

513
00:42:11,991 --> 00:42:14,140
<i>a little fresh paisley,
a little bit...</i>

514
00:42:14,141 --> 00:42:17,360
<i>Kenny says we hit rock bottom
with the Easter freak feast.</i>

515
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:21,280
<i>I always picture rock bottom with way
more hard drugs and bad cooking.</i>

516
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:24,197
<i>So when these last 30 seconds is
when everything really great,</i>

517
00:42:24,223 --> 00:42:26,905
<i>that can happen can,
but also when it could be a disaster.</i>

518
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:32,280
<i>And now it gets you in the right spot,
and then you take it to the plate.</i>

519
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,000
Hey!

520
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:44,360
I got your text. What's going on?

521
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:47,640
- I'm okay! Just...
- Hey!

522
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:54,040
You don't actually seem that ok!

523
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:02,720
Do you remember that morning
I came into your room?

524
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:10,160
Well, I think we can improve on
that memory.

525
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:14,876
What about our abstinence promise?

526
00:43:14,902 --> 00:43:16,945
It will be like a do-over.

527
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:19,240
Do-overs don't count.

528
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:55,040
- I've to go live with my dad.
- What?

529
00:43:56,920 --> 00:44:00,245
They've changed my parenting plan.

530
00:44:00,271 --> 00:44:03,305
Apparently my dad's really been
working his sobriety.

531
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:09,240
They can't make you move
clear across the state.

532
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:12,360
We're minors. They can make
me do anything they want.

533
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:16,992
We have to wait until the
school years over.

534
00:44:16,993 --> 00:44:21,105
No, Lucy... power corrupts. And
parental power corrupts absolutely.

535
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:29,360
Is it because of me, because of us?

536
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:35,000
- Probably.
- My God!

537
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:40,720
We are stupid.
We have ruined everything.

538
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:13,360
Hey!

539
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:16,000
Yo!

540
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:21,880
- Where's Kenny?
- I don't know.

541
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:40,280
Hey, you know what happen right there?

542
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:47,920
You! You have been right there.

543
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:52,680
That is something I never
needed to know.

544
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:58,830
Your dad was the only man
I'd sex with until this year.

545
00:45:58,831 --> 00:46:01,705
Mom, I... come on!

546
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:20,160
Where is Kenny? Where are you?

547
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:23,024
<i>Text to the masses, cutting classes...</i>

548
00:46:23,025 --> 00:46:25,625
<i>smacking them asses...</i>

549
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:30,880
Hello shawty! No, look... seriously.
There's a really great party tonight.

550
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,100
Everyone's gonna be there.

551
00:46:32,126 --> 00:46:34,705
It's too bad I hate everyone
or else I'll be there too.

552
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:36,881
You're weird, you know
but in a super hot way.

553
00:46:36,882 --> 00:46:40,665
You're clueless, you know
but in a dull and obvious way.

554
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:45,360
I see your future, Lucy Diamond.
You'll lighten up and you'll have fun.

555
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:50,955
In high school, I thought
I was going to be famous.

556
00:46:50,956 --> 00:46:52,225
Famous for what?

557
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:55,275
I don't know. I just...
I still think I wasn't going

558
00:46:55,301 --> 00:46:58,145
to end up so, so regular.

559
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:00,120
Boring.

560
00:47:00,146 --> 00:47:03,665
My parents died in a car crash
when I was in high school, so...

561
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:08,280
- actually I like kinda stood out.
- Jesus!

562
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:11,105
And Chuck was an orphan
so I figured he was

563
00:47:11,131 --> 00:47:13,625
the only person who
could understand me.

564
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:17,560
- He sort of rescued you?
- No, that was Lucy.

565
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:23,680
She forced me to fight my way
back to regular and boring.

566
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:27,160
Ooh, there's nothing about you
that's regular and were boring.

567
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:35,040
<i>He hasn't been in school all week.
He wouldn't just leave.</i>

568
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:38,520
- He's really not here, Lucy.
<i>- No, I'm coming over there.</i>

569
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:46,840
Justin said you want to ride
with us to the party.

570
00:47:57,720 --> 00:48:01,360
I got this for you.
Seems like you weren't into beer.

571
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:09,760
- Saint Judah.
- Huh?

572
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:12,864
Patron saint of lost causes.
Beaten to death

573
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:15,025
with a club and beheaded
1st century AD.

574
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:18,720
Isn't that a Beatles song?

575
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:32,640
Nice car. Does it go fast?

576
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:49,545
High school hero can't dance? No!

577
00:48:49,571 --> 00:48:51,545
Are you gonna rapped or are
you gonna dance? Come on!

578
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:53,760
I could dance. I could dance.

579
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:07,320
I think your girlfriend is kinda
jealous of us talking.

580
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:10,240
Jaime? No, me and her
broke-up a long time ago.

581
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:15,320
You don't think I'm good enough,
so I can't hang out with you guys?

582
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:17,600
- She's wrong about that.
- Yeah.

583
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:23,040
- You're drunk.
- I know.

584
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:25,240
Come on.

585
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:50,440
Look, everyone staring at us now.

586
00:49:50,466 --> 00:49:52,525
- Let them watch!
- Okay...

587
00:49:52,526 --> 00:49:54,650
Okay, you've got to give them a show.

588
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:14,360
Come on! I even have
my sweat-shirt on.

589
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:24,341
Come on... I can't move my arms.
Hey, stop!

590
00:50:24,342 --> 00:50:26,825
Come on, cut it out. That's hurt...
cut it out.

591
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,760
That was awesome!

592
00:50:57,320 --> 00:51:01,520
So the word, consensual
mean anything to you?

593
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:06,560
What did you think was
going to happen?

594
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:12,840
I need you... I need you to leave.

595
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:50,880
- Is everything okay?
Does it actually looks like I'm okay?

596
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:37,709
Why do you smell like vomit?

597
00:52:39,921 --> 00:52:42,510
How many possible answers can
there be to that question?

598
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
Kenny is gone.

599
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:58,440
- He didn't even say goodbye.
- Oh Lucy, honey. I'm so sorry.

600
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:05,640
Someone gave me
peppermint schnapps at the party.

601
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:08,224
Once I got sick on cinnamon schnapps.

602
00:53:09,192 --> 00:53:12,145
And now I gargle a little every-time
I walked past a Cinnabon.

603
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:22,560
- Hey Mom...
- Yeah?

604
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:36,800
I puked inside my shirt.

605
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:03,420
It's been my experience,
parents usually

606
00:54:03,446 --> 00:54:05,385
know more than you think they do.

607
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:06,560
My dad's away working.

608
00:54:07,854 --> 00:54:10,065
It might helped both of you
if you let your mother know.

609
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:12,392
She thinks I'll ended up
just like her.

610
00:54:13,265 --> 00:54:16,905
Evidences I collect today can
be held anonymously for 30 days.

611
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:20,800
You've that amount of time to decide
if you want to file a police report.

612
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:26,240
There's a drug Truvada... it would
help prevent you from getting HIV.

613
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:30,160
Like AIDS... HIV?

614
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:32,621
It has to be taken for
3 weeks and the side-effects

615
00:54:32,647 --> 00:54:34,865
are intense like a really bad flu.

616
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:40,280
I'm a sophomore in high school.
I kissed a total of 3 boys.

617
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:43,440
The medication I would encouraged
you to consider given the situation.

618
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:57,560
Hey... hey! How are you?
I... I try to call you.

619
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:00,320
I've been really worried.

620
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:03,200
Hey Lucy! Wait up.

621
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:10,080
I'm not Justin. I'm not like him,
Lucy. I didn't do anything.

622
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:12,739
No, you didn't do anything.
You didn't say anything.

623
00:55:12,740 --> 00:55:14,345
You just let him think it was okay.

624
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:16,239
Yeah... I don't think he's
going to listen to anything.

625
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:18,380
Okay... well, congratulations
because you're so much

626
00:55:18,406 --> 00:55:20,450
the better person, it's impressive.

627
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:29,824
<i>Sorry, I left without saying goodbye.
In my bigger life,</i>

628
00:55:29,978 --> 00:55:33,425
<i>I'm far way more mature than that.
Not such a detestable chicken shit.</i>

629
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:39,946
How are you feeling?

630
00:55:39,972 --> 00:55:44,345
Like I'm covered in coals and
I wanna puked through my eyes.

631
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:49,848
I can't believe you've the
flu on your birthday.

632
00:55:50,274 --> 00:55:51,045
Yeah!

633
00:55:51,046 --> 00:55:55,240
- Rotten luck, huh!
- Wanna open dad's first?

634
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:16,600
Wow, life-time achievement award
for worst present ever.

635
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:21,120
I think they're adorable.

636
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:33,600
- Is that from Kenny?
- Yeah.

637
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:38,200
Oh, these are pretty bottles.

638
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:43,600
It is olive oil.

639
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:47,600
Must be good stuff.

640
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:51,360
It is really, really good.

641
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:04,655
Something smells great!

642
00:57:04,681 --> 00:57:07,162
Oh... It's just chicken.

643
00:57:07,188 --> 00:57:09,730
I didn't have time to plan it,
make it more elaborate.

644
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:17,280
Oh, I didn't know you were
fixing anything.

645
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:20,840
- It's my birthday!
- I'm so sorry. I... I...

646
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:25,280
I just thought that we would go out
together when you're feeling better.

647
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:30,656
You know,
I'll sit with you while you eat.

648
00:57:30,657 --> 00:57:33,145
Hey mom! You don't have to.

649
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:36,300
- No, I'm gonna call and cancel this-
- Mom...

650
00:57:36,301 --> 00:57:37,865
Honestly! That would just
make it worse.

651
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:42,680
I'm fine.

652
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:49,356
<i>So with this dish,
I recommend a delicate dry</i>

653
00:57:49,382 --> 00:57:52,305
<i>white wine from the Pouilly
or from the Veneto</i>

654
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:55,680
<i>My favourite is Pinot Grigio,
riddled in with the greenness</i>

655
00:57:55,706 --> 00:57:59,025
<i>in the hills of the eastern side
of the Fréville mountains.</i>

656
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:04,640
<i>If I hadn't had sex with Kenny,
if I had been more strict with mom...</i>

657
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:09,240
<i>If I made it clear to Dad,
that we needed him here.</i>

658
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:12,500
<i>If I hadn't been such a
stupid drunken dumbass who</i>

659
00:58:12,526 --> 00:58:15,705
<i>didn't even consider something
hideous could happen...</i>

660
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:20,680
<i>With just a little bit...
of toasted sliced almonds.</i>

661
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:47,320
<i>Hey, I got your postcard.</i>

662
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:49,671
<i>Yeah, well, just because
I send you a postcard everyday</i>

663
00:58:49,672 --> 00:58:51,585
<i>doesn't mean I think
about you all the time.</i>

664
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:56,160
<i>- That would be blatantly pathetic.
- Yeah... yeah, even for me.</i>

665
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:01,600
<i>I'd this dream where
we were at the Jungle gym.</i>

666
00:59:01,601 --> 00:59:03,594
<i>Wait, I'm confused.
I thought that was real life.</i>

667
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:04,930
<i>No, no... listen.</i>

668
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:08,763
<i>In a dream, we start at the Jungle
gym. We walked in opposite</i>

669
00:59:08,764 --> 00:59:11,225
<i>direction until we met on the
other side of the world.</i>

670
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:12,559
<i>And then I thank you for</i>

671
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:15,145
<i>- always having my back.
- Yeah...</i>

672
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:16,920
<i>Shut up!</i>

673
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:22,619
<i>You know what we should do this
summer? There's an Italian class</i>

674
00:59:22,645 --> 00:59:25,185
<i>at the library and it's free
and we could take it and...</i>

675
00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:26,725
<i>It's just my dad had
already signed me up</i>

676
00:59:26,726 --> 00:59:28,665
<i>for summer class as
it's a college year.</i>

677
00:59:28,690 --> 00:59:29,470
<i>That's stupid.</i>

678
00:59:29,471 --> 00:59:30,860
<i>But there's a week right before</i>

679
00:59:30,886 --> 00:59:32,050
<i>school start again and...</i>

680
00:59:32,051 --> 00:59:35,650
<i>- What before school start?
- Well, it wasn't my idea, okay.</i>

681
00:59:35,651 --> 00:59:37,690
<i>Kenny, you're kidding me?
You're telling me I'm not gonna</i>

682
00:59:37,691 --> 00:59:43,440
<i>- see you all summer. That's crazy!
- Lucy! Lucy... Lucy...</i>

683
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:48,854
Hey! I...

684
00:59:48,855 --> 00:59:51,979
Okay, I imagined you think you're
being devoted and persistence

685
00:59:51,980 --> 00:59:54,518
- but this is known as stalking.
- Okay, I promised I will

686
00:59:54,544 --> 00:59:55,136
leave you alone.

687
00:59:55,162 --> 00:59:57,530
Oh, so you're stalking me just to
promise to leave me alone this summer.

688
00:59:57,560 --> 01:00:00,010
Please just let me
say one thing, okay.

689
01:00:00,011 --> 01:00:03,229
I've been doing a lot
of thinking lately...

690
01:00:03,230 --> 01:00:05,431
Oh, that's too late to start thinking.
Just stick to

691
01:00:05,457 --> 01:00:07,305
mindlessly following
your peer's group.

692
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:13,160
- That peer group thing...
- Yo... incoming!

693
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:17,319
Artful move there, dude.

694
01:00:17,345 --> 01:00:18,968
<i>Oh, so it's going
to be like that, huh.</i>

695
01:00:18,994 --> 01:00:20,819
<i>- Alright!</i>
- I feel like I need to make

696
01:00:20,845 --> 01:00:22,810
amends for my part in that.

697
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:27,560
Always picking on my rebounds,
huh... Timmy boy.

698
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:35,720
Damn. Pretty step-up, Tim.

699
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:38,600
<i>- Justin, you just got ditch!
- Excuse me...</i>

700
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:43,000
Hey, I'm going fishing. Do you think
you might want to come along?

701
01:00:43,080 --> 01:00:46,360
I've only just stop thinking
of you as an heinous ass-hole.

702
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:48,780
Okay, it's just fishing.
It's to celebrate

703
01:00:48,781 --> 01:00:50,465
the end of the school year. And to

704
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:55,120
show you I'm not a heinous ass-hole.
It doesn't mean anything.

705
01:00:57,400 --> 01:00:59,120
Okay, maybe!

706
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:07,480
Well, you know when Mario Batali
was our age, he was living in Spain.

707
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:09,720
I live in a region that's famous
for it's chicken fried steak.

708
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:14,160
<i>I'm so far behind in my life.</i>

709
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:19,440
You know I read that women who
have had more than one sexual

710
01:01:19,466 --> 01:01:22,385
partners are later more contended
<i>in their marriages.</i>

711
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:27,720
Wow, that's statistically really
romantic of you, Mr. Idle Leftfield.

712
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:32,066
You know if you ever do decide
to hook up with someone else,

713
01:01:32,092 --> 01:01:34,545
just don't tell me about it, okay.
I mean... I...

714
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:39,440
I have a really visual imagination. I
don't need those pictures in my head.

715
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:40,970
You're telling me,
you want me to lie to you?

716
01:01:40,971 --> 01:01:45,385
<i>Yes,</i> please lied your ass off.
Just be convincing.

717
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:52,920
I should warn ya.
I'm an old-fashioned kind of guy.

718
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:56,655
Like to wear tighty whitties and
listen to Bob Seger and ZZ Top.

719
01:01:56,656 --> 01:02:00,440
No... I mean, I believe in going slow.

720
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:04,360
- You mean with sex?
- Yeah.

721
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:07,362
You know I just think... you know...

722
01:02:07,388 --> 01:02:10,625
Real intimacy is physical
and emotional, right.

723
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:15,358
I just... I feel like I need to
really know someone before we can...

724
01:02:15,359 --> 01:02:16,625
Kiss?

725
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:19,880
No, kissing would be ok.

726
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,920
Not the full on horizontal <i>Bob</i>?

727
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:26,108
And now you're making fun of me

728
01:02:26,109 --> 01:02:28,825
- No, no, no, I'm serious.
- No, no... you're making fun of me.

729
01:02:29,560 --> 01:02:32,520
You have no idea how cool
I think that is.

730
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:35,880
It's cool.

731
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:39,920
I get all the love songs now, doesn't
used to make sense to me before.

732
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:45,360
He's married, isn't he?

733
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:49,200
Why do you say things like that?

734
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:52,840
I hate that you're right all the time.

735
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:56,560
I'm a complete pessimist so
the odds are always with me.

736
01:02:58,320 --> 01:03:02,760
Why do people stay together?
In bad relationships I mean.

737
01:03:05,480 --> 01:03:08,920
They eat so much shit for so long,

738
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:12,640
they don't even recognize
the taste of it after a while.

739
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:18,720
You think I've been eating shit,
don't you?

740
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:03,600
- Lucy, wait!
- It's okay. I would like to.

741
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:07,496
Do they have to be oyster mushrooms?

742
01:04:07,522 --> 01:04:09,905
How do you tell which ones
is the oyster mushrooms?

743
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:13,920
Like a lightish-brown,
kind of fan shaped.

744
01:04:14,040 --> 01:04:15,560
Stop.

745
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:22,840
Wait, I'm gonna ask somebody.

746
01:04:25,080 --> 01:04:27,160
Never mind, I'll be home
in a little bit.

747
01:04:33,120 --> 01:04:34,760
Shit, shit! Quickly, quickly!

748
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:40,360
Hey, kiddo!

749
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:50,280
Quickly put your jeans on!

750
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:14,560
Hello... hello?

751
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:20,520
Anyone here?

752
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:22,720
Lucy?

753
01:05:38,320 --> 01:05:41,560
- Hello?
- Bob?

754
01:05:41,640 --> 01:05:44,400
Hey! I'm with the family now.

755
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:48,687
Is that your estranged wife that you
have your arm around right now?

756
01:05:48,688 --> 01:05:51,505
<i>The one you can't stand to touch?</i>

757
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:02,400
- Please, please, please please...
- Lainee?

758
01:06:05,480 --> 01:06:07,600
Jeff? Is that... is that you?

759
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:12,952
Just because we didn't have sex
does not mean you weren't cheating.

760
01:06:12,978 --> 01:06:16,305
<i>You should know that, you're being</i>
unfaithful to everyone around you.

761
01:06:16,360 --> 01:06:18,040
Lainee!

762
01:06:20,680 --> 01:06:22,400
Dad, it's just me.

763
01:06:23,320 --> 01:06:24,880
Lucy...

764
01:06:25,640 --> 01:06:27,120
I'm coming over there
if you keep this up.

765
01:06:27,121 --> 01:06:30,345
Look... don't! I'll just...,
let me go to the...

766
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:34,400
Mr. Diamond... I'm Tim, I'm sorry that
we had to meet this way

767
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:36,120
Just one second.

768
01:06:41,880 --> 01:06:45,760
Tim, Tim... will you please stop it!

769
01:06:51,720 --> 01:06:53,280
Daddy!

770
01:06:53,360 --> 01:06:56,776
- Don't make a scene.
No, you make a scene! This is entirely

771
01:06:56,802 --> 01:06:59,825
and completely your old-fashioned
guy kind of scene!

772
01:07:03,080 --> 01:07:05,774
Hey, sweet-sweetie,
look I got you these.

773
01:07:05,776 --> 01:07:08,745
Why don't you go put that in the...
in the car with Mummy, huh.

774
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:13,073
We love each other.
We're going to get married.

775
01:07:13,074 --> 01:07:15,065
No, we do not. We're not... just go!

776
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:24,480
Daddy... daddy, are you okay?

777
01:07:44,920 --> 01:07:52,120
And Saint Agathe was forced into a
brothel, but no man... could... enter.

778
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:56,280
Those who even dare to touch
her got sick and die.

779
01:07:56,840 --> 01:07:59,840
She was thrown into the
prison and tortured.

780
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:04,320
Her breasts were crushed
and then cut-off.

781
01:08:05,080 --> 01:08:08,120
She was forced to roll in hot coals.

782
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:13,360
But through-out it all,
she refused to give up her virginity.

783
01:08:20,520 --> 01:08:24,120
So, I should wanna be
tortured and mutilated

784
01:08:24,146 --> 01:08:27,905
rather than have sex with
a guy I really liked?

785
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:29,989
Is that the moral to the story?

786
01:08:31,315 --> 01:08:33,105
This is not the person I want
you to be, Lucy.

787
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:35,738
What do you want me to be?
You want me to be like mom who

788
01:08:35,764 --> 01:08:38,345
as it happen, you got pregnant
when we were both exactly my age.

789
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:42,560
Your mother and I gave up everything.
We got married to have you.

790
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:46,040
What? How about if I'm a self-center
immature controlling high school

791
01:08:46,066 --> 01:08:49,465
drop-out who uses every
excuse not to be with my family?

792
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:51,680
Is that the person you want me to be?

793
01:08:52,720 --> 01:08:55,440
You're such an awesome
role model, dad.

794
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:11,783
You know we need to showing up every

795
01:09:11,786 --> 01:09:13,745
3 months to provide
your moral guidance.

796
01:09:13,800 --> 01:09:17,240
I got it. I got it!

797
01:10:01,320 --> 01:10:03,720
We could get a restraining order.

798
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:05,790
Why? He'll just come back in

799
01:10:05,791 --> 01:10:07,745
a few months and everything
will be the same.

800
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:11,560
I don't want that!

801
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:19,560
- Are you and dad over, then?
- We were over a long, long time ago.

802
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:27,080
I wish my parents were still alive.

803
01:10:27,880 --> 01:10:29,560
Do you miss them?

804
01:10:31,040 --> 01:10:34,440
Yeah, but I missed them all for you.

805
01:10:35,720 --> 01:10:40,080
- I wish you had them.
- Grandparents would be kind of cool.

806
01:10:40,160 --> 01:10:42,600
I came from a good family, you know.

807
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:48,160
And any mess I have made of my life,
I'd no one to blame but myself.

808
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:58,480
There's no one I want to talk to...
Except Kenny and you.

809
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:10,360
- Hello.
<i>- Lainee, is that you?</i>

810
01:11:10,440 --> 01:11:12,193
- Ron?
<i>- It's me.</i>

811
01:11:12,219 --> 01:11:15,185
- Oh, my God!
<i>- I know, right...</i>

812
01:11:15,240 --> 01:11:17,587
<i>- I just thought that I...</i>
- Ron...

813
01:11:17,613 --> 01:11:19,865
- Where are you?
<i>- Well, actually I'm...</i>

814
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:22,440
You know it's been years
and years and years.

815
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:27,400
- Well, I know I did.
<i>- So I tried to...</i>

816
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:34,240
This is not the person I want
you to be.

817
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:39,920
Mom!

818
01:11:40,840 --> 01:11:44,240
Did dad ever try to find his parents?
- What?

819
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:47,200
I thought maybe that's why
he was gone all the times.

820
01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:50,717
- Hey, you know what I was thinking?
- No, almost never.

821
01:11:50,718 --> 01:11:53,945
We get a way for awhile.
We take a little road trip.

822
01:11:54,040 --> 01:11:56,633
Ron was saying that his parents
owned a restaurant in Fairview.

823
01:11:56,634 --> 01:11:57,705
Ron?

824
01:11:57,760 --> 01:12:01,200
As in your high school boyfriend, Ron?

825
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:03,554
Well, we could have dinner with Ron.

826
01:12:03,555 --> 01:12:06,505
And then just you and me,
we could stayed for a few days.

827
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:10,440
- Why would we do that?
- Because we never do anything.

828
01:12:10,520 --> 01:12:15,062
We deserve something fun. And 'cause,
it's got... you know all that

829
01:12:15,063 --> 01:12:18,265
nature and beauty stuff going on.

830
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:22,597
- I guess...
- Okay, great!

831
01:12:22,600 --> 01:12:26,680
We go packed if we're gonna go.
We should hit the road.

832
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:10,926
Ron parents owned
"The Two Sister's Cafe"?

833
01:13:10,927 --> 01:13:13,265
- You've heard of it?
- You haven't heard of it?

834
01:13:14,120 --> 01:13:16,400
Ron been helping his dad
past few weeks.

835
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:17,577
He's supposed to leave
this morning but

836
01:13:17,578 --> 01:13:20,465
he said he'll wait for
us if we came up.

837
01:13:24,160 --> 01:13:26,040
Are you done?

838
01:13:43,560 --> 01:13:46,240
Hi, Lainee.

839
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:58,440
- This is Lucy.
- Oh... hi!

840
01:14:57,880 --> 01:14:59,680
Stop staring.

841
01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:06,320
- I like him.
- Yeah, me too.

842
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:10,000
- He's kind of like your Kenny.
- Yeah, maybe.

843
01:15:12,080 --> 01:15:17,200
Ron owns a restaurant on a beach.
It's like a really high-end place.

844
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:20,000
- What beach?
- Puerto Vallarta.

845
01:15:20,080 --> 01:15:22,120
The Puerto Vallarta that's in Mexico?

846
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:28,720
- He likes us to come down there.
- Like a vacation?

847
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:32,262
Ron really, really likes you, Lucy.
You could work

848
01:15:32,288 --> 01:15:35,625
at a professional kitchen.
We could learn to speak Spanish.

849
01:15:35,680 --> 01:15:39,120
It's the kind of vacation
where I get a job?

850
01:15:39,200 --> 01:15:42,042
He needs to leave tonight. It would
take a couple of days

851
01:15:42,068 --> 01:15:44,665
to get down there but we could all get
to know each other better in the car.

852
01:15:44,720 --> 01:15:46,735
You realized that's insane, right?

853
01:15:46,761 --> 01:15:49,465
Right, that's probably
part of the appeal.

854
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:54,368
Remember when you told me
that you and dad were done?

855
01:15:54,394 --> 01:15:56,403
Oh actually no, wait.
That's was today!

856
01:15:56,429 --> 01:15:56,930
No... no!

857
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:00,123
This is not about me and your dad.

858
01:16:00,125 --> 01:16:02,112
No, so what's this about?
Because it's not about

859
01:16:02,138 --> 01:16:04,170
me working in a professional kitchen.

860
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:07,000
- It'll be fun.
- Mom, stop! We're not doing this.

861
01:16:07,080 --> 01:16:09,759
You're not the one who decides.
I'm the mom and you're the kid.

862
01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:10,905
Based on what?

863
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:12,830
Your great sense of
responsibilities or

864
01:16:12,831 --> 01:16:14,625
your amazing problem solving skills?

865
01:16:14,680 --> 01:16:17,022
You want us to move
to Puerto Vallarta with

866
01:16:17,023 --> 01:16:17,988
some stranger from what, God knows...

867
01:16:17,989 --> 01:16:19,545
No! He's not a stranger!

868
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:23,872
Lucy, please!
I have to know, I have to do this!

869
01:16:23,873 --> 01:16:26,408
Have to know what?
How awesome your life

870
01:16:26,409 --> 01:16:27,585
would've been if I hadn't been born?

871
01:16:27,640 --> 01:16:33,080
God, no! No, Lucy, you're the only
thing that's turned out right.

872
01:16:34,120 --> 01:16:37,400
You're... everything!

873
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:45,840
I just... I just can't do it anymore.

874
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:50,080
Can't do what? Be my mom?

875
01:16:51,360 --> 01:16:53,200
I just...

876
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:58,240
... feel like I'm... like I'm dying.

877
01:16:59,640 --> 01:17:01,440
I...

878
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:08,680
I need something.
I need... something else.

879
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:15,280
I need to... belong.

880
01:17:16,600 --> 01:17:20,440
I need to find something.

881
01:17:24,120 --> 01:17:26,520
Okay, mom.

882
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:34,160
If you need to go... go.

883
01:17:38,640 --> 01:17:43,800
- I can't go without you.
- I'm 16. I'm not pregnant.

884
01:17:43,880 --> 01:17:46,040
I'm not getting married.

885
01:17:48,200 --> 01:17:50,670
Who can take better
care of me than me?

886
01:17:50,671 --> 01:17:53,442
No, Lucy, I...

887
01:17:54,290 --> 01:17:55,519
You're gonna make me run
away to Mexico

888
01:17:55,520 --> 01:17:58,825
with you and your
high school boyfriend? No!

889
01:18:00,360 --> 01:18:02,440
You go.

890
01:18:11,080 --> 01:18:15,680
I... I can maybe go for two weeks.

891
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:19,880
I'll take it.

892
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:23,480
- I'll give you the ATM card.
- Okay.

893
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:29,440
- Okay, two weeks.
- Okay.

894
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:38,624
<i>Jean Paul Satre said we experience
sense of being abandon</i>

895
01:18:38,650 --> 01:18:41,505
<i>when we realize there is no God.</i>

896
01:18:41,560 --> 01:18:45,040
<i>- Or in this case parents to guide us.</i>
- I love you.

897
01:18:45,880 --> 01:18:48,472
But it forces us to
take absolute responsibility

898
01:18:48,473 --> 01:18:50,945
for our actions and choices.

899
01:18:52,080 --> 01:18:53,920
I think I'm responsible.

900
01:18:55,200 --> 01:18:58,840
You're the most responsible
person that I know.

901
01:18:58,920 --> 01:19:03,080
Well, you don't know that many people.
- Still, I know a lots of people.

902
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:10,360
- Did you hear me before?
- I did.

903
01:19:13,240 --> 01:19:14,840
Thanks for having my back.

904
01:19:16,680 --> 01:19:18,760
Always have.

905
01:19:20,200 --> 01:19:22,360
<i>Always will.</i>

906
01:19:34,600 --> 01:19:39,160
Please don't hate me for this.
I'll call you everyday.

907
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:51,402
My dad will be back in an hour, so...

908
01:19:51,403 --> 01:19:53,905
- So I'm sure you would have to meet..
- Yeah, I'll be back in here.

909
01:24:01,880 --> 01:24:04,280
Hi, I'm Lucy Diamond.

910
01:24:05,880 --> 01:24:08,160
My name is Gerald.

911
01:24:08,240 --> 01:24:11,320
My mom's the one who ran
away to Mexico with your son.

912
01:24:12,400 --> 01:24:15,520
Yeah, that kind of circle
back around, didn't it?

913
01:24:16,840 --> 01:24:19,560
- Are you hungry?
- What are we serving?

914
01:24:21,920 --> 01:24:26,280
Eggs in hell. Oh, no offense,
it's just custom sauce.

915
01:24:26,360 --> 01:24:28,280
None taken.

916
01:24:40,440 --> 01:24:42,785
Actually saw this place
on the food network.

917
01:24:42,786 --> 01:24:44,225
- Really?
- Yeah.

918
01:24:45,120 --> 01:24:49,920
Well, we do okay for a food cafe
stuck out in the middle of nowhere.

919
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:09,840
Nicely done. The Jalapeño doesn't
overpower the other flavours.

920
01:25:09,920 --> 01:25:14,400
This is like a... plate of
home-cooked Americana.

921
01:25:16,200 --> 01:25:18,080
Cool.

922
01:25:21,320 --> 01:25:24,400
You know, if you like this,
I make a mean risotto.

923
01:25:24,835 --> 01:25:25,994
- Oh, I love risotto.
- Yeah.

924
01:25:26,134 --> 01:25:27,450
It's comfort food.

925
01:25:30,680 --> 01:25:33,169
<i>Here's how I think my
bigger life will look.</i>

926
01:25:33,195 --> 01:25:35,745
<i>My parents split up.</i>

927
01:25:35,800 --> 01:25:38,840
<i>I graduated from the
culinary institute.</i>

928
01:25:39,640 --> 01:25:44,240
<i>Kenny gets a PhD in something brainy
and world changing.</i>

929
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:46,680
<i>Later I publish
a best-selling cookbook</i>

930
01:25:46,681 --> 01:25:49,785
<i>based on the recipes

931
01:25:49,840 --> 01:25:52,800
<i>Mario Batali writes the introduction.</i>

932
01:25:54,440 --> 01:25:59,520

then the future is too, right?</i>
