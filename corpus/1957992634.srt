1
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:06,816
(foreboding music)

2
00:00:09,325 --> 00:00:12,325
(traffic whooshing)

3
00:00:18,249 --> 00:00:19,082
(tires screeching)

4
00:00:19,083 --> 00:00:21,295
(crash banging)
(glass shattering)

5
00:00:21,296 --> 00:00:26,296
(fire crackling)
(distant siren alarming)

6
00:00:27,078 --> 00:00:30,328
(pleasant flute music)

7
00:00:59,975 --> 00:01:02,459
- There was a car
wreck last night.

8
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:03,810
Your mom's in the hospital.

9
00:01:04,758 --> 00:01:07,102
(gentle piano music)

10
00:01:07,103 --> 00:01:08,623
Do you understand, Lily?

11
00:01:09,518 --> 00:01:12,768
(dramatic tempo music)

12
00:02:00,259 --> 00:02:03,342
(footsteps thumping)

13
00:02:04,683 --> 00:02:06,183
Did you get a nap?

14
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:08,419
Well, should we
get you cleaned up

15
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:09,763
and in some fresh clothes?

16
00:02:10,807 --> 00:02:11,807
- I'm fine.

17
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,680
- Okay.

18
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,350
Was Grandma Beth still napping?

19
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,926
- Can we go to the hospital?

20
00:02:24,927 --> 00:02:26,489
I want to see her.

21
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:27,437
- I know but we can't right now.

22
00:02:27,438 --> 00:02:28,869
- [Lily] I want
to stay with her.

23
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:29,750
- You can't.

24
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:30,583
- Why not?

25
00:02:30,584 --> 00:02:32,193
- Because hospitals have rules.

26
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:36,079
This is gonna take
patience, okay?

27
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,572
You can help with Grandma Beth.

28
00:02:37,573 --> 00:02:38,909
- I don't want to
help with Grandma,

29
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:40,799
I wanna stay with Mom.

30
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,103
- A routine is gonna
be good for all of us.

31
00:02:50,448 --> 00:02:53,198
(birds chirping)

32
00:03:04,032 --> 00:03:06,562
(atmosphere whooshing)

33
00:03:06,563 --> 00:03:09,396
(chimes clinking)

34
00:03:13,111 --> 00:03:15,861
(birds chirping)

35
00:03:16,953 --> 00:03:19,453
(eerie music)

36
00:03:25,219 --> 00:03:28,136
(unsettling music)

37
00:03:32,731 --> 00:03:34,878
(thunder rumbling)

38
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:38,129
(dramatic tempo music)

39
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,349
- You're leaving?

40
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:53,236
- Yeah, I gotta go to work.

41
00:03:53,237 --> 00:03:55,709
I'm sorry that you have
to stay here all day

42
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:56,929
but I haven't been
able to figure out

43
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:58,039
any of the arrangements.

44
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,149
If you have any issues,
you just call me, okay?

45
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:01,500
The number's on the fridge.

46
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,719
There's plenty of sandwich
stuff if you get hungry

47
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,677
and we'll talk when
I get home, okay?

48
00:04:12,976 --> 00:04:16,143
(piano keys clinking)

49
00:04:18,316 --> 00:04:21,066
(birds chirping)

50
00:04:26,768 --> 00:04:29,935
- We should go to
the hospital anyway.

51
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:33,519
I don't know.

52
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,520
Hitch hick?

53
00:04:35,876 --> 00:04:37,829
Of course I don't
wanna be kidnapped.

54
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:40,193
Why would you even ask that?

55
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:44,927
- [Man] Little bird.

56
00:04:45,854 --> 00:04:49,021
(somber string music)

57
00:04:57,046 --> 00:04:58,282
- Lily?

58
00:04:58,283 --> 00:04:59,789
Well hello, sweetheart!

59
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:00,790
- Hi.

60
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:10,659
Why don't you guys have a TV?

61
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:11,933
- We have books.

62
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,269
You aren't going to tell me

63
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:17,299
that you prefer TV
to books, are you?

64
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,645
- TV is fun.

65
00:05:18,646 --> 00:05:19,789
(Beth chuckling)

66
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:24,153
- If fun is having someone just
zap things into your brain.

67
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:27,069
Here.

68
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:28,529
- Thanks.

69
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:30,519
- There's nothing real about TV.

70
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,809
It's not like the
stories in books.

71
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:35,003
- There's nothing
real about stories.

72
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:36,870
- Nothing real?

73
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:40,530
Come on.

74
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:48,579
I have trouble remembering
things, did you know that?

75
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:50,339
- Aunt Martha told me.

76
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:51,819
- Just little things, really.

77
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,983
Ah, here it is.

78
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,279
These are some sketches

79
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,616
from the last thing
I was working on,

80
00:06:04,617 --> 00:06:06,630
"The Farmer and the Fire Elf."

81
00:06:06,631 --> 00:06:08,869
- The Fire Elf
isn't a real thing.

82
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:10,519
- So you say.

83
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,570
Do you wanna hear it?

84
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:14,589
- Where are the words?

85
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:16,043
- All up here.

86
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:21,349
Once there was a goodly farmer

87
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:25,844
who lives with his lovely wife
right on this land, in fact.

88
00:06:25,845 --> 00:06:28,339
(pleasant flute music)

89
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:31,099
One day, when he was
tending his field,

90
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:34,479
there was an earthquake that
shook the ground under his feet

91
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,665
and rattled him to his bones.

92
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:37,675
(dramatic music)

93
00:06:37,676 --> 00:06:41,419
The earth split and a great
hole opened next to the farmer,

94
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:43,803
who walked to the edge
and peered inside.

95
00:06:44,717 --> 00:06:47,469
(ominous music)

96
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:48,523
- What was inside?

97
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,440
- I'm note sure you're
ready for this story yet.

98
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:59,319
As the farmer was
looking into the hole,

99
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:04,233
a small man, caked in ash and
cinders, was crawling out.

100
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:07,999
The farmer was scared
something fierce

101
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,893
as he watched the small man
shake the cinders from his coat.

102
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:14,279
- Was the man magic?

103
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:17,689
- [Beth] There was magic in
him but it was a dark magic,

104
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:21,039
for it was not a man who
crawled out of the hole

105
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,873
but a fire elf.

106
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:27,083
(sinister music)

107
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:31,429
The elf told the farmer that
he had come to grant him

108
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:34,929
whatever he wished if only
the farmer would allow him

109
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:37,843
passage across his land
and out into the world.

110
00:07:40,046 --> 00:07:42,519
Well, the farmer
quickly surmised

111
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,499
that there was evil
in this creature.

112
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:48,059
So he told the elf that
he wanted nothing from him

113
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:50,959
and that he would not allow
him to pass across his land

114
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,079
but that rather he
should go back down

115
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,793
the hole from which he came.

116
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:58,609
Well the elf was furious
that the farmer would not

117
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:00,389
let him pass across his land.

118
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:04,763
He vowed to do whatever he
could to hurt the farmer.

119
00:08:04,764 --> 00:08:06,979
(ominous music)

120
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:10,591
So one night, he stole
into the farmer's house...

121
00:08:10,592 --> 00:08:13,092
(eerie music)

122
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:19,133
and took the very
heart from his world.

123
00:08:20,182 --> 00:08:23,019
(sinister music)

124
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:24,409
- [Lily] Heart?

125
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:28,039
- All those things we
love and hold most dear.

126
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:31,909
In this case, it was the
health of the farmer's wife,

127
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:35,123
who soon became ill and
was confined to her bed.

128
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:39,939
The elf took the heart and
broke it into three pieces

129
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:42,749
which he placed with
three bewitched subjects

130
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,679
in three other worlds.

131
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,559
He gave one piece to a maiden

132
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,753
and cast a spell
of vanity on her.

133
00:08:50,345 --> 00:08:52,789
He gave a second
piece to a writer,

134
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:56,279
and cast a spell of
melancholy on him.

135
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:59,859
The third piece he
gave to an astronomer,

136
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:03,683
then cast him out, lost
into a starless void.

137
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:07,193
The farmer was heartbroken.

138
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:10,519
The next evening,

139
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:13,089
he left his wife in
the care of a neighbor

140
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:15,789
and set out to seek
the pieces of the heart

141
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:17,419
and save his wife.

142
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:19,647
- How did the
farmer go traveling?

143
00:09:19,648 --> 00:09:21,379
To the other worlds, I mean.

144
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:25,399
- Just after sundown, when the
worlds are closest together,

145
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,496
that's when you can travel.

146
00:09:27,497 --> 00:09:31,279
You must close your eyes and
picture where you want to go

147
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,339
because you want the
place you are seeking

148
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,933
to also be seeking you.

149
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:39,409
When you open your eyes,
you must be very quiet

150
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:41,449
and keep a keen eye.

151
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:42,599
- Have you gone?

152
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:46,699
- Oh no, it takes a lot
of courage to travel

153
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:49,819
and he waits out
there, bitter as ever,

154
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:52,509
looking for a way
out into our world.

155
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:54,409
- What happened to the farmer?

156
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:57,391
- Oh, he went looking
for the pieces.

157
00:09:57,392 --> 00:10:01,159
Perhaps the Fire
Elf captured him.

158
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,073
- I thought it was true.

159
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:05,289
- It is true.

160
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:07,603
I just have to
remember all the parts.

161
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:10,939
- Can the heart
make people better?

162
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:12,499
- Certainly.

163
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:15,429
If you know where to
look for the pieces.

164
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:19,749
And if you have the right
things to go traveling with.

165
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:20,583
- What things?
(lively tempo music)

166
00:10:20,584 --> 00:10:22,869
- A whole bag of tricks.

167
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:25,169
- [Lily] The farmer
took a sewing bag?

168
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:27,099
- Oh, I doubt it.

169
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:31,939
But all travelers must
have their own things.

170
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:34,209
- That's not a true story.

171
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:36,729
- I don't tell tall tales.

172
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:37,943
- What happened next?

173
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:42,743
- I'll give it some thought
and see if I can remember.

174
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,940
You can hang on to
them if you like.

175
00:10:47,646 --> 00:10:50,896
(pleasant flute music)

176
00:11:09,171 --> 00:11:11,754
(somber music)

177
00:11:24,391 --> 00:11:25,719
- [Man] Little bird.

178
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:28,755
(Lily gasping)

179
00:11:28,756 --> 00:11:29,756
Little bird.

180
00:11:35,054 --> 00:11:37,721
(ominous music)

181
00:11:38,885 --> 00:11:41,381
(birds chirping)

182
00:11:41,382 --> 00:11:42,382
Little bird.

183
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:47,553
(somber flute music)

184
00:12:04,491 --> 00:12:05,491
Little bird.

185
00:12:14,824 --> 00:12:17,824
(somber horn music)

186
00:12:18,997 --> 00:12:21,664
(ominous music)

187
00:12:23,618 --> 00:12:26,368
(steam sizzling)

188
00:12:29,493 --> 00:12:30,493
Little bird.

189
00:12:40,685 --> 00:12:43,768
(lively tempo music)

190
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:48,014
(doors thudding)

191
00:12:50,361 --> 00:12:51,361
- Help!

192
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,520
Help!

193
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:55,900
Help!

194
00:12:57,338 --> 00:12:58,338
Help!

195
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:02,771
(fire rumbling)

196
00:13:02,772 --> 00:13:05,439
(ominous music)

197
00:13:06,556 --> 00:13:08,473
- What do we have here?

198
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:12,819
A little traveler?

199
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,119
- Let me out.

200
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:17,869
- Perhaps we can be of some...

201
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:19,871
use to each other.

202
00:13:19,872 --> 00:13:20,820
- What?

203
00:13:20,821 --> 00:13:25,820
- You're searching for a
way to save someone, yes?

204
00:13:26,316 --> 00:13:29,349
Your poor mother.

205
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,029
I'm...

206
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:34,099
very sorry, indeed.

207
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:36,862
I could help her if you like.

208
00:13:36,863 --> 00:13:37,929
- You can?

209
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:39,169
- Oh yes.

210
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:41,533
I could heal her.

211
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:44,269
Good as new.

212
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:45,969
But in turn,

213
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:47,019
you...

214
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:50,879
must do one simple thing...

215
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,149
for me.

216
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:52,983
- What?

217
00:13:52,984 --> 00:13:55,290
- All you need to do...

218
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:58,419
is invite me...

219
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:01,371
to pass out of this land.

220
00:14:01,372 --> 00:14:02,839
- I can't.

221
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,903
- Of course you can.

222
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:07,373
- I know what you are.

223
00:14:07,374 --> 00:14:09,549
(elf hissing)

224
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:12,233
- You place your
hopes in the heart.

225
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:16,589
You shall never find it.

226
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:18,079
- Maybe I will.

227
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,183
- No, child.

228
00:14:21,829 --> 00:14:24,750
I'm your only hope.

229
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:26,932
- No.

230
00:14:26,933 --> 00:14:30,649
- Your mother may
not live much longer.

231
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:32,239
- That's not true.

232
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,399
- I know death,

233
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,400
little one.

234
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:41,350
I know grief and misery

235
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:46,210
and I doubt you're brave
enough, little bird.

236
00:14:47,892 --> 00:14:50,475
(elf laughing)

237
00:14:52,049 --> 00:14:54,469
(fire rumbling)

238
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:55,394
Good luck.

239
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:58,144
(sinister music)

240
00:15:00,988 --> 00:15:03,988
(suspenseful music)

241
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:10,779
(bird cooing)

242
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:18,423
- Mom will get better.

243
00:15:19,424 --> 00:15:20,924
We don't need him.

244
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:27,639
(crickets chirping)

245
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:30,079
- [Beth] I don't want to
wear this dress, it's old.

246
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,073
- [Martha] It's just
a nightgown, Mother.

247
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:36,089
- [Beth] I told the little
girl we need to leave,

248
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:38,419
that he won't stop
until she's dead.

249
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:39,253
- [Martha] Who?

250
00:15:39,254 --> 00:15:41,319
- [Beth] That
woman, the sick one.

251
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:44,359
He'll come for her soon
too, mark my words.

252
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,549
I told the child all about it.

253
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:47,600
- Sleep well, mother.

254
00:15:59,826 --> 00:16:02,826
You know she confuses
things, right?

255
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,059
Why don't you go ahead
and get ready for bed?

256
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:07,289
I'll start you a bath.

257
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:08,290
- I can do it.

258
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:12,513
She doesn't tell tall tales.

259
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:15,503
- They're only stores, Lily.

260
00:16:18,913 --> 00:16:22,047
(water faucet spraying)

261
00:16:22,048 --> 00:16:25,215
(gentle string music)

262
00:16:29,153 --> 00:16:31,149
- [Beth] Just after sundown,

263
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:33,518
when the worlds are
closest together,

264
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:35,769
that's when you can travel.

265
00:16:40,095 --> 00:16:41,942
(unsettling music)

266
00:16:41,943 --> 00:16:43,530
(atmosphere whooshing)

267
00:16:43,531 --> 00:16:48,531
(water bubbling)
(suspenseful music)

268
00:16:52,889 --> 00:16:55,806
(thunder rumbling)

269
00:17:11,987 --> 00:17:15,070
(music intensifying)

270
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:20,958
(dramatic music)
(water bubbling)

271
00:17:35,683 --> 00:17:38,683
(suspenseful music)

272
00:17:43,717 --> 00:17:46,550
(cannons booming)

273
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,917
(foreboding music)

274
00:17:58,548 --> 00:18:01,131
(gentle music)

275
00:18:05,148 --> 00:18:08,981
(pleasant instrumental music)

276
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:24,030
- What in God's...

277
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:27,000
Have you been in the
bath this whole time?

278
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,059
Look at this mess.

279
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:31,913
- It just happened.

280
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:34,430
- Get to bed.

281
00:18:38,555 --> 00:18:41,305
(Martha sighing)

282
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:46,393
- Don't worry, I
won't try that again.

283
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,729
- It's got some
cracks in the paint

284
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:53,281
but I'll take care of it.

285
00:18:53,282 --> 00:18:54,299
- [Martha] How much
more is that gonna cost?

286
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,869
- [Man] Ah, it's easy,
don't worry about it.

287
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:56,870
- Thanks.

288
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,400
- [Man] Sam, bring
me a paint scraper.

289
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:07,450
- Hey.

290
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:09,200
- Hey.

291
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,200
- You living here?

292
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:13,979
- Just visiting my
aunt and grandma.

293
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:15,869
- Your aunt used to babysit me.

294
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:17,807
When I was younger, I mean.

295
00:19:17,808 --> 00:19:19,253
- I bet that was fun.

296
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:21,443
- How'd the tub flood?

297
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:23,410
- I did it.

298
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:26,039
But...

299
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,588
I fell asleep.

300
00:19:27,589 --> 00:19:28,589
- Oh.

301
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:32,759
My dad said your grandma's
having memory things.

302
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,779
- She still remembers
a lot though.

303
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:37,799
- She used to tell me all kinds
of stories about traveling

304
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:38,949
in other worlds and stuff.

305
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:40,599
- That's what I
was dreaming about,

306
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:43,563
a story she told me when
I fell asleep in the tub.

307
00:19:44,923 --> 00:19:46,709
It's stupid.

308
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:47,799
- No.

309
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:48,929
I love her stories,

310
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:49,973
there were cool.

311
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:53,133
- Yeah, like almost real.

312
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,040
- Yeah.

313
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,559
I mean, they aren't but,

314
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,759
well, you never know.

315
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,263
- [Man] Sam, paint scraper!

316
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:07,859
- Here you go.

317
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:08,883
If you go traveling.

318
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:12,883
My dad said to check it
but it still kinda works.

319
00:20:14,075 --> 00:20:15,000
- Thanks.

320
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
No problem.

321
00:20:22,284 --> 00:20:25,617
(truck engine rumbling)

322
00:20:31,452 --> 00:20:34,285
- I'll be back as
soon as I'm off.

323
00:20:48,132 --> 00:20:50,882
(Lily crunching)

324
00:21:14,359 --> 00:21:17,276
(foreboding music)

325
00:21:26,567 --> 00:21:27,976
(Lily gasping)

326
00:21:27,977 --> 00:21:30,477
(Beth crying)

327
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:44,310
- Oh.

328
00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:46,493
- What's wrong, Grandma?

329
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,640
- Jane.

330
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,738
- Mom is in the hospital.

331
00:21:53,739 --> 00:21:56,350
- I don't understand how.

332
00:21:56,351 --> 00:22:01,351
(dramatic music) (Beth crying)

333
00:22:09,819 --> 00:22:12,509
- We're going to find the
pieces of the heart for Mom.

334
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:14,010
That's what we're going to do.

335
00:22:14,973 --> 00:22:17,599
(pleasant flute music)

336
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,269
Stop being such a worry wart.

337
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:22,563
Yes, I know I almost drowned.

338
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:25,859
You have to picture
where you want to go.

339
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:27,073
I didn't do that.

340
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,533
Yes, I do know where
to picture going.

341
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:37,043
Well, how am I supposed to know
what all this stuff is for?

342
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:43,707
Well, are you coming or not?

343
00:22:54,429 --> 00:22:56,796
(Lily sighing)

344
00:22:56,797 --> 00:22:57,812
The Maiden.

345
00:22:57,813 --> 00:23:01,063
(lively chiming music)

346
00:23:11,826 --> 00:23:14,576
(exciting music)

347
00:23:20,824 --> 00:23:23,907
(gentle flute music)

348
00:23:39,516 --> 00:23:42,099
(somber music)

349
00:24:35,186 --> 00:24:37,936
(dramatic music)

350
00:25:04,803 --> 00:25:07,553
(birds chirping)

351
00:25:13,174 --> 00:25:15,757
(somber music)

352
00:25:35,283 --> 00:25:39,200
Well, it's better than ending
up underwater, I guess.

353
00:25:40,295 --> 00:25:43,962
(somber instrumental music)

354
00:25:55,816 --> 00:25:58,983
(gentle string music)

355
00:26:31,969 --> 00:26:34,469
(eerie music)

356
00:26:42,964 --> 00:26:45,964
(suspenseful music)

357
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:06,823
That was close.

358
00:27:08,133 --> 00:27:10,663
Did he look familiar to you?

359
00:27:10,664 --> 00:27:13,310
(somber horn music)

360
00:27:13,311 --> 00:27:16,061
(birds chirping)

361
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:28,249
Hello?

362
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:30,328
- One moment while I get ready.

363
00:27:30,329 --> 00:27:32,589
No, this won't do.

364
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:34,753
No, this won't do at all.

365
00:27:38,863 --> 00:27:42,030
(pleasant harp music)

366
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:45,444
- I think it's lovely.

367
00:27:45,445 --> 00:27:47,649
- Yes, it is.

368
00:27:47,650 --> 00:27:51,087
But what would a
little girl know?

369
00:27:51,088 --> 00:27:53,003
(birds chirping)

370
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:55,174
- Those birds sound beautiful.

371
00:27:55,175 --> 00:27:56,120
- Birds?

372
00:27:56,121 --> 00:27:58,532
Be a good girl and
stop distracting me.

373
00:27:58,533 --> 00:27:59,610
I won't be long.

374
00:28:00,713 --> 00:28:03,296
(somber music)

375
00:28:23,605 --> 00:28:25,105
- Can you help me?

376
00:28:26,327 --> 00:28:29,309
- Ah, I may have something
that will fit you.

377
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:31,330
- No, I'm looking for...

378
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:33,379
for a heart.

379
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:35,577
- Let's try this one.

380
00:28:36,903 --> 00:28:38,469
- It's very pretty.

381
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:39,470
- Here.

382
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:47,909
(birds chirping)

383
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:49,493
A few more touches.

384
00:28:52,774 --> 00:28:54,606
- It's nice but...

385
00:28:54,607 --> 00:28:57,013
- How beautiful
that looks on you.

386
00:28:58,030 --> 00:29:00,119
- It looks pretty?

387
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:02,863
- Oh, indeed, and there is
no substitute for beauty.

388
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:08,053
Beauty is the outward shine
of a happy and righteous soul.

389
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:11,199
- I don't know.

390
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,159
- There's no injury too
deep and no pain too great

391
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,883
that beauty cannot reconcile.

392
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:18,255
- Really?

393
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:19,549
- Oh, yes.

394
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:22,516
To be beautiful is to have
the sun shining upon you

395
00:29:22,517 --> 00:29:25,319
for all others to see.

396
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:30,320
- What about someone who
is pretty but isn't nice?

397
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:32,369
- Simply impossible, dear.

398
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:34,697
How we look is who we are.

399
00:29:34,698 --> 00:29:37,281
(gentle music)

400
00:29:41,002 --> 00:29:42,579
There.

401
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:43,510
See?

402
00:29:43,511 --> 00:29:44,923
Do you not feel happy?

403
00:29:55,573 --> 00:29:58,740
(gentle string music)

404
00:30:03,398 --> 00:30:05,649
- Nicole said I was ugly.

405
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:06,640
- What?

406
00:30:06,641 --> 00:30:08,659
Of course you're not ugly.

407
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:10,363
Nicole must be blind as a bat.

408
00:30:11,269 --> 00:30:13,669
(Jane chuckling)

409
00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:16,213
You are very pretty.

410
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:20,913
- Nicole is prettier.

411
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:23,220
- That's not true.

412
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:26,753
And that's not what's important.

413
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:30,269
It's not about what's
on the surface.

414
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:31,739
I mean, that's all
that mirror shows,

415
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:35,919
not what's underneath and
that's where the real beauty is,

416
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,533
the kind of person you are.

417
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:41,773
So don't you go
getting stuck in there.

418
00:30:41,774 --> 00:30:44,130
(Jane chuckling)

419
00:30:44,131 --> 00:30:46,881
(pleasant music)

420
00:30:55,915 --> 00:30:58,445
(birds chirping)

421
00:30:58,446 --> 00:31:01,185
(ominous music)

422
00:31:01,186 --> 00:31:02,857
(glass shattering)

423
00:31:02,858 --> 00:31:07,002
- What have you done?
(dramatic music)

424
00:31:07,003 --> 00:31:09,753
(birds chirping)

425
00:31:11,368 --> 00:31:12,763
What is that sweet sound?

426
00:31:14,007 --> 00:31:15,533
- The birds outside.

427
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:20,277
- Maybe a short
moment to listen?

428
00:31:20,278 --> 00:31:23,028
(pleasant music)

429
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,373
Perhaps more feathers.

430
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:56,077
(lively instrumental music)

431
00:32:06,528 --> 00:32:09,861
(drum cymbals crashing)

432
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:14,563
(drum cymbals crashing)

433
00:32:15,909 --> 00:32:19,742
(dramatic instrumental music)

434
00:32:29,741 --> 00:32:32,491
(birds chirping)

435
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:38,970
(pleasant music)

436
00:32:40,283 --> 00:32:43,962
I've forgotten how lovely
the nights are here.

437
00:32:43,963 --> 00:32:45,179
- Can you help me?

438
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:46,569
- [Maiden] Of course, child.

439
00:32:46,570 --> 00:32:50,696
- I'm looking for a
heart or part of one.

440
00:32:50,697 --> 00:32:52,229
- A heart.

441
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:53,230
Oh, yes.

442
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:05,557
(atmosphere whooshing)

443
00:33:05,558 --> 00:33:08,343
(birds chirping)

444
00:33:08,344 --> 00:33:09,400
- Thank...

445
00:33:09,401 --> 00:33:12,151
(sinister music)

446
00:33:28,050 --> 00:33:31,076
I knew that man in
rags looked familiar.

447
00:33:31,077 --> 00:33:32,727
The Fire Elf
must've trapped him.

448
00:33:36,382 --> 00:33:37,382
Ow.

449
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:43,909
- Morning.

450
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:45,599
What in the world?

451
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,083
Why didn't you come get me?

452
00:33:47,958 --> 00:33:50,453
Well, it's just a small
cut, thank goodness.

453
00:33:51,370 --> 00:33:53,479
How did you cut yourself?

454
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,553
- I don't know.

455
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:57,930
- All right, well come on.

456
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:01,710
All right.

457
00:34:04,970 --> 00:34:08,113
Is there anything you wanna
tell me, to talk about?

458
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:10,920
Why don't you go
ahead and get dressed?

459
00:34:10,921 --> 00:34:12,543
I'll go make breakfast.

460
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:26,510
Lily, I need you to
come down here, please!

461
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:38,409
You may not wanna
talk about things

462
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:39,963
but I need you to explain this.

463
00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:44,699
- I'm just trying to help Mom.

464
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:47,539
I went through there,
into a mansion,

465
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:51,309
and there was a man in rags
and there was a maiden too.

466
00:34:51,310 --> 00:34:53,569
She was trying on
al these dresses

467
00:34:53,570 --> 00:34:55,699
and there were tons of mirrors.

468
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:56,700
- Please stop.

469
00:34:58,390 --> 00:35:00,319
I know that you're confused

470
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:03,273
but lying to me will only
make this entire thing worse.

471
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,779
What? (gentle string music)

472
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:08,669
- Why do you hate me?

473
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:10,279
- I don't.

474
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,573
Not at all.

475
00:35:13,774 --> 00:35:15,729
(Martha sighing)

476
00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:16,730
Honey,

477
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:19,729
you know that there is a chance

478
00:35:19,730 --> 00:35:21,859
that your mom won't
wake up, right?

479
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:23,109
- She will!

480
00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:26,056
- It was a very back
wreck and you know that...

481
00:35:26,057 --> 00:35:26,890
- You're horrible!

482
00:35:26,891 --> 00:35:28,789
I wish you never
brought me here!

483
00:35:28,790 --> 00:35:30,263
- Lily, come back!

484
00:35:37,435 --> 00:35:40,018
(gentle music)

485
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:49,477
(flashlight clicking)

486
00:35:52,776 --> 00:35:55,443
(door knocking)

487
00:36:02,297 --> 00:36:04,239
- Can you tell me
more of the story?

488
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,419
- You mean the story
about the rabbit

489
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:09,129
who accidentally
learned to speak French?

490
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:11,969
- I'd like to hear
that one day but...

491
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:14,493
- How about a snack?

492
00:36:21,128 --> 00:36:23,878
(birds chirping)

493
00:36:29,570 --> 00:36:31,719
- Talked to the doctors today.

494
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:33,319
Your mom's still in a coma

495
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:35,549
but they say the pressure
on her brain's reduced.

496
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:36,989
So that's good news.

497
00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:39,079
- Can we go see her, please?

498
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:40,393
- We can go on Saturday.

499
00:36:41,690 --> 00:36:43,423
It's the next time I'm off.

500
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:52,089
(crickets chirping)

501
00:36:52,090 --> 00:36:55,029
- [Beth] You're just so
sweet to an old lady.

502
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:56,319
- [Martha] Thank you, Mom.

503
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:59,003
- [Beth] I do hope they
give you a raise soon.

504
00:37:03,811 --> 00:37:04,948
- Goodnight.

505
00:37:04,949 --> 00:37:05,949
- Goodnight.

506
00:37:07,038 --> 00:37:10,038
(crickets chirping)

507
00:37:12,274 --> 00:37:15,357
(lively tempo music)

508
00:37:25,602 --> 00:37:27,519
We can't sissy out now.

509
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,033
You heard, we're helping Mom.

510
00:37:32,290 --> 00:37:33,843
I know Aunt Martha's mad.

511
00:37:35,018 --> 00:37:37,289
You'd think for a bird that
could fly away anytime,

512
00:37:37,290 --> 00:37:39,260
you'd be a little bit more bold.

513
00:37:40,393 --> 00:37:43,393
(lively horn music)

514
00:37:51,574 --> 00:37:53,253
The Writer.

515
00:37:53,254 --> 00:37:57,087
(exciting instrumental music)

516
00:38:01,507 --> 00:38:04,090
(wind howling)

517
00:38:05,179 --> 00:38:07,762
(gentle music)

518
00:38:16,733 --> 00:38:19,316
(wind howling)

519
00:38:25,168 --> 00:38:28,374
Yes, I know that's
Aunt Martha's room.

520
00:38:28,375 --> 00:38:31,458
(gentle flute music)

521
00:38:34,784 --> 00:38:37,951
(somber string music)

522
00:38:56,362 --> 00:38:59,385
(Martha snoring)

523
00:38:59,386 --> 00:39:02,219
(Martha groaning)

524
00:39:05,789 --> 00:39:08,872
(lively tempo music)

525
00:39:31,955 --> 00:39:35,788
(dramatic instrumental music)

526
00:39:45,105 --> 00:39:46,308
(books clattering)

527
00:39:46,309 --> 00:39:48,020
(Martha gasping)

528
00:39:48,021 --> 00:39:50,854
(Martha groaning)

529
00:39:51,981 --> 00:39:55,064
(somber flute music)

530
00:39:58,191 --> 00:40:00,774
Oh, you've gotta be kidding me.

531
00:40:01,836 --> 00:40:04,919
(lively tempo music)

532
00:40:47,338 --> 00:40:51,005
(somber instrumental music)

533
00:41:23,594 --> 00:41:26,545
(ominous music)

534
00:41:26,546 --> 00:41:29,296
(mystical music)

535
00:41:35,735 --> 00:41:38,235
(eerie music)

536
00:41:43,636 --> 00:41:46,636
(suspenseful music)

537
00:41:53,842 --> 00:41:55,363
- [Writer] No, nope.

538
00:41:55,364 --> 00:41:56,781
Nope, no, no, no.

539
00:41:58,636 --> 00:42:00,017
No,

540
00:42:00,018 --> 00:42:02,091
No. (somber horn music)

541
00:42:02,092 --> 00:42:03,276
(writer groaning)

542
00:42:03,277 --> 00:42:06,027
(paper ruffling)

543
00:42:13,461 --> 00:42:16,294
(writer groaning)

544
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:26,069
- Hello?

545
00:42:26,070 --> 00:42:26,903
(writer groaning)

546
00:42:26,904 --> 00:42:29,323
I'm looking for a piece
of a wooden heart.

547
00:42:29,324 --> 00:42:30,999
Have you seen one lying around?

548
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,319
- No!

549
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:33,320
- You sure?

550
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:35,530
- What's that?

551
00:42:35,531 --> 00:42:36,833
- Are you the writer?

552
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:40,059
- Well, I don't know
about "the" writer

553
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:41,749
but I am a writer.

554
00:42:41,750 --> 00:42:44,659
At least, that's what
I believed I was.

555
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:45,493
- What're you writing about?

556
00:42:45,494 --> 00:42:46,809
- Well that's the
thing, isn't it?

557
00:42:46,810 --> 00:42:47,999
That's the very thing.

558
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,209
Well, see, it's supposed
to be something light,

559
00:42:50,210 --> 00:42:52,549
something guaranteed
to bring smiles

560
00:42:52,550 --> 00:42:54,169
to the faces of the guests

561
00:42:54,170 --> 00:42:57,239
but I can't seem to
strike the right chord.

562
00:42:57,240 --> 00:43:02,240
They start light enough and
then devolve into gloom,

563
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:03,363
misery.

564
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:07,429
- People like sad
stories sometimes.

565
00:43:07,430 --> 00:43:08,589
- Well, yes,

566
00:43:08,590 --> 00:43:11,799
but this request comes
from the King, himself,

567
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:14,163
for the Princess' birthday.

568
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:19,386
- Want some help?

569
00:43:19,387 --> 00:43:22,256
(writer chuckling)

570
00:43:22,257 --> 00:43:24,079
- You know, that might
be just the thing.

571
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:27,089
Perhaps you could help me,
being as how you are a child

572
00:43:27,090 --> 00:43:29,199
with innocent intentions.

573
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:31,309
You do have innocent
intentions, correct?

574
00:43:31,310 --> 00:43:34,939
What I mean to say is you're
not a wild phantom beast

575
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:37,359
with a transmorphing spell
cast upon you, are you?

576
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:39,169
That would be just my luck.

577
00:43:39,170 --> 00:43:40,003
- Uh, no.

578
00:43:40,003 --> 00:43:40,836
- Good!

579
00:43:40,837 --> 00:43:43,609
It would be extremely
inconvenient to be eaten alive

580
00:43:43,610 --> 00:43:45,499
at this particular juncture.

581
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:46,719
Come!

582
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:47,753
Here, come.

583
00:43:49,126 --> 00:43:50,613
Come, sit.

584
00:43:50,614 --> 00:43:53,697
(upbeat flute music)

585
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:57,258
Give me a subject.

586
00:43:57,259 --> 00:43:59,109
- How about...

587
00:43:59,110 --> 00:44:00,080
a unicorn?

588
00:44:00,081 --> 00:44:02,069
- I had a pet unicorn once.

589
00:44:02,070 --> 00:44:02,903
- Really?

590
00:44:02,903 --> 00:44:03,736
- Really.

591
00:44:03,737 --> 00:44:05,239
Glorious magical beasts.

592
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:07,966
No one mentions the
flatulence, however.

593
00:44:07,967 --> 00:44:09,399
(writer chuckling)

594
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:11,549
Okay, go on.

595
00:44:11,550 --> 00:44:14,378
- What if it was
ridden by a prince?

596
00:44:14,379 --> 00:44:16,013
- Yes.

597
00:44:16,014 --> 00:44:17,509
Ah.

598
00:44:17,510 --> 00:44:19,209
- And he's on a quest.

599
00:44:19,210 --> 00:44:20,295
- Quest, yes.

600
00:44:20,296 --> 00:44:22,380
- To save his entire kingdom

601
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:28,149
from an army that wants
to take over his people.

602
00:44:28,150 --> 00:44:29,309
- All right!

603
00:44:29,310 --> 00:44:32,219
The prince gathers
an army of his own.

604
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:33,679
The army is proud

605
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:34,929
and determined.
(army men shouting)

606
00:44:34,930 --> 00:44:38,850
The prince leads them
forth to a glorious battle.

607
00:44:38,851 --> 00:44:41,479
(writer neighing)

608
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:42,809
During which,

609
00:44:42,810 --> 00:44:45,228
the prince is knocked
from his steed.

610
00:44:45,229 --> 00:44:48,299
(writer yelping)

611
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:49,919
As the battle rages around him,

612
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:53,999
the prince struggles to
get his feet under him.

613
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,659
Just as he stands, a giant
stone from a cannonball

614
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:58,929
smashes him flat.
(prince screaming)

615
00:44:58,930 --> 00:45:01,026
The army flees in terror.

616
00:45:01,027 --> 00:45:02,319
(writer screaming)
(army men screaming)

617
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:06,078
Another stone smashes
his one-horned steed.

618
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:07,743
- What?

619
00:45:07,744 --> 00:45:09,994
You can't kill the
prince, he's the hero.

620
00:45:09,995 --> 00:45:10,910
- Oh.

621
00:45:10,911 --> 00:45:12,249
Did I just kill the hero?

622
00:45:12,250 --> 00:45:14,299
- Yes, and a unicorn.

623
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:15,779
- Oh no!

624
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:17,479
No!

625
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:19,409
Could you imagine what
the children would think?

626
00:45:19,410 --> 00:45:22,389
- They probably wouldn't
like it very much.

627
00:45:22,390 --> 00:45:26,199
- The King would probably
separate me from my head.

628
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:28,213
- Sounds like you'd
pretty much hate it.

629
00:45:32,490 --> 00:45:33,743
They should live forever.

630
00:45:37,270 --> 00:45:38,420
- No one lives forever.

631
00:45:39,454 --> 00:45:41,579
(somber music)

632
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:43,903
- They can in a
story, can't they?

633
00:45:45,230 --> 00:45:46,230
- Perhaps.

634
00:45:47,170 --> 00:45:48,793
But will that be true to life?

635
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:55,029
- We'll just have to start over.

636
00:45:55,030 --> 00:45:56,969
- What's the use?

637
00:45:56,970 --> 00:45:58,899
They all end the same way.

638
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:01,150
I should've been a mason

639
00:46:02,030 --> 00:46:03,289
or a baker.

640
00:46:03,290 --> 00:46:06,289
One is unlikely to lose one's
head over yeast and rolls.

641
00:46:06,290 --> 00:46:08,226
I am worthless!

642
00:46:08,227 --> 00:46:09,522
Worthless!

643
00:46:09,523 --> 00:46:12,234
(writer screaming)

644
00:46:12,235 --> 00:46:13,985
- What a drama queen.

645
00:46:15,730 --> 00:46:18,972
Well, there's no time
for wallowing in sorrow.

646
00:46:18,973 --> 00:46:19,806
(writer groaning)

647
00:46:19,807 --> 00:46:23,499
You need to think about something
else or do something fun.

648
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:24,809
- What's the use?

649
00:46:24,810 --> 00:46:27,589
- My mom and I dance in
the kitchen sometimes.

650
00:46:27,590 --> 00:46:30,039
I bet it would make
you feel better.

651
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:32,749
- I wrote a story about
a dancer earlier today.

652
00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:34,763
It ended in a
gruesome house fire.

653
00:46:37,142 --> 00:46:39,378
(radio buzzing)

654
00:46:39,379 --> 00:46:40,514
- Come on. (upbeat
radio music)

655
00:46:40,515 --> 00:46:43,418
- Oh well, I suppose
there's nothing to lose.

656
00:46:43,419 --> 00:46:45,129
- That's the spirit.

657
00:46:45,130 --> 00:46:46,530
- I'll probably get a cramp.

658
00:46:47,603 --> 00:46:51,270
(upbeat violin radio music)

659
00:46:56,422 --> 00:46:59,422
(upbeat band music)

660
00:47:57,833 --> 00:47:58,666
Ugh.

661
00:47:58,667 --> 00:48:01,569
Well, you were certainly
right about the dancing.

662
00:48:01,570 --> 00:48:03,543
Thank you for your help.

663
00:48:05,740 --> 00:48:09,599
You know, this place
is awfully dramatic.

664
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:11,619
I think I'll find a
more suitable place

665
00:48:11,620 --> 00:48:14,283
to write this lighthearted fare.

666
00:48:16,090 --> 00:48:19,453
Be sure to write me
whenever you wish.

667
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:25,580
I would love to hear from you.

668
00:48:27,610 --> 00:48:28,610
Goodbye.

669
00:48:30,290 --> 00:48:31,799
- Wait!

670
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:34,429
Can you tell me where to
find the wooden heart?

671
00:48:34,430 --> 00:48:35,430
- You mean that one?

672
00:48:36,589 --> 00:48:37,889
(chiming music)

673
00:48:37,890 --> 00:48:38,890
- Thanks.

674
00:48:41,819 --> 00:48:43,969
(gentle music)

675
00:48:43,970 --> 00:48:45,173
We have to be quiet.

676
00:48:48,943 --> 00:48:51,237
(Lily sighing)

677
00:48:51,238 --> 00:48:52,905
Aunt Martha's house.

678
00:48:54,725 --> 00:48:57,392
(ominous music)

679
00:48:59,158 --> 00:49:00,825
Aunt Martha's house.

680
00:49:04,165 --> 00:49:05,832
Aunt Martha's house.

681
00:49:08,112 --> 00:49:11,279
(ominous tempo music)

682
00:49:17,898 --> 00:49:20,148
- How clever you must feel.

683
00:49:21,006 --> 00:49:23,589
(elf laughing)

684
00:49:24,867 --> 00:49:26,169
Two pieces.

685
00:49:26,170 --> 00:49:27,473
Well done.

686
00:49:28,443 --> 00:49:29,776
I know a secret.

687
00:49:31,838 --> 00:49:35,827
I know you're not brave
enough to save her!

688
00:49:37,070 --> 00:49:39,797
Not when you can't
even admit the truth!

689
00:49:44,155 --> 00:49:45,738
I'll have her soon!

690
00:49:48,294 --> 00:49:49,294
Very soon!

691
00:49:50,094 --> 00:49:52,594
(elf hissing)

692
00:49:56,667 --> 00:49:59,250
(gentle music)

693
00:50:00,096 --> 00:50:02,596
- Ha, we're too quick for him.

694
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:09,403
(somber flute music)

695
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:27,463
Oh no.

696
00:50:36,610 --> 00:50:37,610
- Come here.

697
00:50:48,421 --> 00:50:49,599
Why would you do this?

698
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:51,339
- I didn't do it.

699
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:53,569
- Lily, why would
you tear up my books?

700
00:50:53,570 --> 00:50:55,279
- I told you, it wasn't me!

701
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:56,280
- Then who?

702
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:58,839
- You don't know everything.

703
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:01,339
You think that Mom's going
to die but she's not!

704
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:02,649
- I don't think that.

705
00:51:02,650 --> 00:51:03,859
- Yes you do!

706
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:05,839
You just want me to
forget about her.

707
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:07,739
- Of course I don't
want you to forget her.

708
00:51:07,740 --> 00:51:09,049
I want you to talk about...

709
00:51:09,050 --> 00:51:11,029
- Then why won't
you let me see her?

710
00:51:11,030 --> 00:51:12,480
- That is not what I'm doing.

711
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:19,199
You have to understand

712
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:21,150
that things are really
tight right now.

713
00:51:22,290 --> 00:51:24,623
We will go see your
mom as soon as we can.

714
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:30,149
I do think it would
help if we could talk.

715
00:51:30,150 --> 00:51:33,209
If we could talk about, if
we could talk about people,

716
00:51:33,210 --> 00:51:34,669
if we could talk
about people dying.

717
00:51:34,670 --> 00:51:35,503
- Why?

718
00:51:35,504 --> 00:51:37,159
She's going to get better.

719
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:38,560
- Lily, that's not what I...

720
00:51:39,604 --> 00:51:40,854
(dramatic music)

721
00:51:40,855 --> 00:51:42,855
That's not what I meant.

722
00:51:48,528 --> 00:51:49,528
Uh-huh.

723
00:51:51,700 --> 00:51:54,677
No, extra hours
are fine next week.

724
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:58,220
Yeah, thank you again.

725
00:51:58,221 --> 00:51:59,221
Thanks.

726
00:52:00,978 --> 00:52:03,645
(Martha crying)

727
00:52:06,231 --> 00:52:09,564
(dramatic string music)

728
00:52:21,597 --> 00:52:23,309
(Martha knocking)

729
00:52:23,310 --> 00:52:24,659
Let's go see your mom.

730
00:52:24,660 --> 00:52:26,857
We have to be quick, okay,
I only have half a day.

731
00:52:28,901 --> 00:52:32,151
(pleasant flute music)

732
00:52:38,855 --> 00:52:42,601
(gentle piano music)

733
00:52:42,602 --> 00:52:43,685
Come on, Mom.

734
00:52:47,911 --> 00:52:50,602
It's Jane.

735
00:52:50,603 --> 00:52:51,853
- That's not...

736
00:52:52,792 --> 00:52:56,592
- Yeah.

737
00:52:56,593 --> 00:52:59,676
(gentle piano music)

738
00:53:11,368 --> 00:53:12,321
Mom,

739
00:53:12,321 --> 00:53:13,154
Mom,

740
00:53:13,155 --> 00:53:14,520
do you wanna sit down?

741
00:53:15,798 --> 00:53:16,798
Okay.

742
00:53:24,673 --> 00:53:26,853
- I'm gonna fix it all.

743
00:53:26,854 --> 00:53:29,026
- I told you, that's why.

744
00:53:29,027 --> 00:53:30,837
That's why we...

745
00:53:30,838 --> 00:53:32,322
- It's okay.

746
00:53:32,323 --> 00:53:33,323
It's okay.

747
00:53:39,929 --> 00:53:41,356
You know,

748
00:53:41,357 --> 00:53:44,219
sometimes we want
things to be real

749
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:46,853
or things not to have happened.

750
00:53:48,090 --> 00:53:50,590
We can want them so much
that we ignore the truth.

751
00:54:08,157 --> 00:54:08,990
(Lily sighing)

752
00:54:08,991 --> 00:54:11,199
- We have to find the
last piece tonight.

753
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:12,253
We have to.

754
00:54:16,780 --> 00:54:18,149
How does the story end?

755
00:54:18,150 --> 00:54:19,619
- The story?

756
00:54:19,620 --> 00:54:21,713
- The Farmer and the Fire Elf.

757
00:54:35,350 --> 00:54:37,059
- [Beth] A twist.

758
00:54:37,060 --> 00:54:37,900
- [Lily] Huh?

759
00:54:37,901 --> 00:54:41,079
- The story has a twist.

760
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:42,333
They all do.

761
00:54:46,540 --> 00:54:49,189
The farmer searched and searched

762
00:54:49,190 --> 00:54:54,159
but the Fire Elf had one more
trick up his dark sleeve.

763
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:54,993
- What happened?

764
00:54:54,994 --> 00:54:57,003
Did the farmer win
against the Fire Elf?

765
00:54:59,190 --> 00:55:01,033
- I don't quite remember.

766
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:06,119
But if he did win,

767
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:08,169
one thing is certain,

768
00:55:08,170 --> 00:55:12,259
the solution came from a
place we didn't expect.

769
00:55:12,260 --> 00:55:14,533
Usually from right here.

770
00:55:19,980 --> 00:55:22,399
- [Martha] You should
eat some dinner, Mom.

771
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:23,999
- I don't like this.

772
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,469
- You like pasta.

773
00:55:25,470 --> 00:55:27,519
- What else do they have here?

774
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:30,029
- I think that's all
that's on the menu tonight.

775
00:55:30,030 --> 00:55:33,433
- What kind of a place
only serves one thing?

776
00:55:35,330 --> 00:55:37,930
- They were so busy that
they ran out of everything.

777
00:55:38,849 --> 00:55:39,682
- Oh.

778
00:55:39,683 --> 00:55:40,854
(gentle flute music)

779
00:55:40,855 --> 00:55:41,855
Well.

780
00:55:47,809 --> 00:55:49,155
- Can I be excused?

781
00:55:49,156 --> 00:55:50,156
- Mm-hmm.

782
00:55:53,847 --> 00:55:56,430
(somber music)

783
00:56:07,296 --> 00:56:09,879
(lively music)

784
00:56:11,950 --> 00:56:16,112
- If you don't wanna
come, you don't have to.

785
00:56:16,113 --> 00:56:17,530
Of course you do.

786
00:56:24,353 --> 00:56:26,206
The Astronomer.

787
00:56:26,207 --> 00:56:30,040
(exciting instrumental music)

788
00:56:48,562 --> 00:56:52,562
(somber orchestral choir music)

789
00:57:54,290 --> 00:57:57,957
(somber instrumental music)

790
00:58:00,975 --> 00:58:03,725
(wall crackling)

791
00:58:31,413 --> 00:58:32,413
Whoa.

792
00:58:36,296 --> 00:58:38,379
You gotta see this place.

793
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:45,537
(ominous tempo music)

794
00:58:45,538 --> 00:58:48,288
(clocks ticking)

795
00:59:07,260 --> 00:59:09,253
What do you mean, which way?

796
00:59:11,130 --> 00:59:12,463
There's nothing.

797
00:59:16,151 --> 00:59:19,234
(machinery clanking)

798
00:59:20,092 --> 00:59:24,259
(dramatic orchestral
choir music)

799
00:59:25,481 --> 00:59:28,231
(clocks ticking)

800
00:59:37,667 --> 00:59:38,667
Hello?

801
00:59:41,030 --> 00:59:42,197
Hold on tight.

802
00:59:43,057 --> 00:59:47,057
(somber orchestral choir music)

803
01:00:24,197 --> 01:00:27,052
(steam hissing)

804
01:00:27,053 --> 01:00:31,220
(pleasant orchestral
choir music)

805
01:00:41,604 --> 01:00:42,604
Excuse me?

806
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:48,979
I was hoping you could help me.

807
01:00:48,980 --> 01:00:51,049
- How have you come here?

808
01:00:51,050 --> 01:00:52,050
- From...

809
01:00:54,190 --> 01:00:55,623
There was a rope.

810
01:00:56,740 --> 01:00:58,379
You speak English?

811
01:00:58,380 --> 01:01:00,889
- I speak many languages.

812
01:01:00,890 --> 01:01:03,039
You've been imprisoned as well?

813
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:05,149
- No, I asked to come here.

814
01:01:05,150 --> 01:01:07,569
- So you can take us away.

815
01:01:07,570 --> 01:01:08,570
- I can try.

816
01:01:09,424 --> 01:01:13,091
(gentle instrumental music)

817
01:01:21,258 --> 01:01:22,925
Aunt Martha's house.

818
01:01:25,376 --> 01:01:26,873
Aunt Martha's house.

819
01:01:30,310 --> 01:01:32,323
It's easier to go
than to get back.

820
01:01:35,736 --> 01:01:36,736
I'm sorry.

821
01:01:38,731 --> 01:01:40,109
What are you looking at?

822
01:01:40,110 --> 01:01:43,769
- I'm looking for a
point of reference.

823
01:01:43,770 --> 01:01:44,720
- A what?

824
01:01:44,721 --> 01:01:47,599
- Something that can
show me where here is.

825
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:50,059
- You don't know where we are?

826
01:01:50,060 --> 01:01:51,060
- No.

827
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:54,419
- And there's nothing out there?

828
01:01:54,420 --> 01:01:55,783
- See for yourself.

829
01:01:58,452 --> 01:02:01,202
(wheel creaking)

830
01:02:06,189 --> 01:02:09,856
(gentle vocalization music)

831
01:02:15,133 --> 01:02:16,133
- No stars.

832
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:17,960
- None.

833
01:02:24,190 --> 01:02:27,857
(gentle vocalization music)

834
01:02:32,840 --> 01:02:35,590
- If there's nothing up there,
why do you keep looking?

835
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:39,683
- Does your kind like
the company of others?

836
01:02:40,680 --> 01:02:42,599
- We like being
with our families.

837
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:44,659
- The same is true for my kind.

838
01:02:44,660 --> 01:02:47,529
If we're separated or alone,

839
01:02:47,530 --> 01:02:49,150
we're very unhappy.

840
01:02:49,151 --> 01:02:50,949
- So everyone is gone?

841
01:02:50,950 --> 01:02:51,783
- No.

842
01:02:51,784 --> 01:02:55,649
Most likely, we're just
beyond the edge of the stars,

843
01:02:55,650 --> 01:02:57,379
very far away.

844
01:02:57,380 --> 01:02:58,929
- Same thing, I guess.

845
01:02:58,930 --> 01:02:59,930
- Untrue.

846
01:03:05,730 --> 01:03:10,730
Existing and not existing
are very different things.

847
01:03:11,980 --> 01:03:15,419
Everything came
from the same speck.

848
01:03:15,420 --> 01:03:18,069
The stars, the planets,

849
01:03:18,070 --> 01:03:20,929
the atoms in your skin,

850
01:03:20,930 --> 01:03:24,719
and everything can feel
the pull of everything else

851
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:26,419
and one day all those things

852
01:03:26,420 --> 01:03:28,159
will pull each other
together again,

853
01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:30,903
back to the same bright point.

854
01:03:31,970 --> 01:03:35,623
Eventually, we will
all be one again.

855
01:03:36,626 --> 01:03:37,689
(crickets chirping)

856
01:03:37,690 --> 01:03:39,090
- [Lily] How many are there?

857
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:43,849
- More than grains
of sand on the beach.

858
01:03:43,850 --> 01:03:45,899
- And they are very far away?

859
01:03:45,900 --> 01:03:50,853
- Yes but they all came
from the same place.

860
01:03:53,082 --> 01:03:55,832
(pleasant music)

861
01:04:03,057 --> 01:04:06,839
(lively tempo music)

862
01:04:06,840 --> 01:04:09,819
- We just need something
else out there.

863
01:04:09,820 --> 01:04:12,120
- That's precisely what
I've been looking for.

864
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:19,650
(pleasant flute music)

865
01:04:26,980 --> 01:04:28,579
What are those?

866
01:04:28,580 --> 01:04:29,793
- They're stars.

867
01:04:30,810 --> 01:04:35,203
- I've seen many stars
but none like those.

868
01:04:36,320 --> 01:04:38,867
- Everything came from
the same place, right?

869
01:04:46,167 --> 01:04:50,000
(pleasant instrumental music)

870
01:04:50,892 --> 01:04:52,763
- Very curious!

871
01:05:00,237 --> 01:05:03,769
(suspenseful music)

872
01:05:03,770 --> 01:05:05,303
What have you done?

873
01:05:05,304 --> 01:05:06,554
- I don't know.

874
01:05:11,401 --> 01:05:13,984
(gentle music)

875
01:05:17,642 --> 01:05:20,892
(spacecraft whooshing)

876
01:05:22,875 --> 01:05:26,125
(dramatic tempo music)

877
01:05:30,696 --> 01:05:33,613
(insects chirping)

878
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:43,099
- Will you join us?

879
01:05:43,100 --> 01:05:44,239
- I have to get back home,

880
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:46,739
to my people.

881
01:05:46,740 --> 01:05:48,823
- Thank you, little traveler.

882
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:59,243
(spacecraft humming)

883
01:06:01,365 --> 01:06:04,615
(atmosphere whooshing)

884
01:06:07,160 --> 01:06:10,160
(crickets chirping)

885
01:06:20,208 --> 01:06:22,953
(music chiming)

886
01:06:22,954 --> 01:06:26,204
(pleasant flute music)

887
01:06:42,030 --> 01:06:44,889
- [Beth] I told you, I am
not ready to go to bed yet!

888
01:06:44,890 --> 01:06:46,899
This is my house
and you work here

889
01:06:46,900 --> 01:06:48,176
and I'd like you
to remember that!

890
01:06:48,177 --> 01:06:50,239
- Can you please?
- Will, don't touch!

891
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:51,522
Get your filthy hands off me.
- Look...

892
01:06:51,523 --> 01:06:53,929
- You can't just go around
touching people like that!

893
01:06:53,930 --> 01:06:55,459
- I just...

894
01:06:55,460 --> 01:06:57,139
- And you can't bring people

895
01:06:57,140 --> 01:06:59,779
into my house without
my permission.

896
01:06:59,780 --> 01:07:02,249
I won't allow it!

897
01:07:02,250 --> 01:07:03,523
Shoo, get!

898
01:07:04,708 --> 01:07:05,541
Who is that?

899
01:07:05,542 --> 01:07:08,859
Who is this child that you
have brought into my house

900
01:07:08,860 --> 01:07:11,233
without even asking me about it?

901
01:07:11,234 --> 01:07:12,551
You've never asked
for my permission,

902
01:07:12,552 --> 01:07:14,206
you never even told me
it was going to happen.

903
01:07:14,207 --> 01:07:15,498
- [Martha] Mom,
please, just calm...

904
01:07:15,499 --> 01:07:17,234
- [Beth] Oh, just
leave me alone!

905
01:07:17,235 --> 01:07:19,377
(door thudding)

906
01:07:19,378 --> 01:07:21,878
(eerie music)

907
01:07:24,581 --> 01:07:27,331
(fire crackling)

908
01:07:37,857 --> 01:07:40,200
- Did you misplace
something, little bird?

909
01:07:41,859 --> 01:07:42,979
- Give it back.

910
01:07:42,980 --> 01:07:46,929
- Why would I give back
something that belongs to me?

911
01:07:46,930 --> 01:07:48,339
- It's not yours.

912
01:07:48,340 --> 01:07:53,340
- Do you think the true heart
would be made of simple wood?

913
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:57,439
You think a heart can be mended

914
01:07:57,440 --> 01:08:00,599
by simply putting the
pieces back together?

915
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:01,748
- What?

916
01:08:01,749 --> 01:08:04,817
(sinister music)

917
01:08:04,818 --> 01:08:05,818
No!

918
01:08:07,958 --> 01:08:10,708
(fire whooshing)

919
01:08:12,592 --> 01:08:15,342
(sinister music)

920
01:08:20,205 --> 01:08:21,205
No!

921
01:08:23,013 --> 01:08:27,159
- I told you you're not strong
enough to find what you seek!

922
01:08:27,160 --> 01:08:28,160
Now,

923
01:08:28,950 --> 01:08:33,357
allow me into this
world and I'll save her.

924
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:37,035
- I don't believe you.

925
01:08:37,036 --> 01:08:38,036
- Come now, child.

926
01:08:39,806 --> 01:08:41,389
You can believe me.

927
01:08:43,360 --> 01:08:44,360
- No.

928
01:08:48,714 --> 01:08:49,714
- So be it.

929
01:08:50,699 --> 01:08:53,366
(ominous music)

930
01:08:54,634 --> 01:08:56,503
Your mother...

931
01:08:56,504 --> 01:08:58,004
will soon drift...

932
01:08:59,551 --> 01:09:00,551
away.

933
01:09:01,989 --> 01:09:03,183
- No.

934
01:09:03,184 --> 01:09:05,934
(dramatic music)

935
01:09:12,330 --> 01:09:17,330
(gentle flute music)
(birds chirping)

936
01:09:27,686 --> 01:09:30,769
(somber tempo music)

937
01:09:45,649 --> 01:09:48,399
(glass clinking)

938
01:10:02,475 --> 01:10:03,475
Grandma?

939
01:10:14,387 --> 01:10:17,137
(birds chirping)

940
01:10:21,010 --> 01:10:22,010
- [Sam] Hi.

941
01:10:24,275 --> 01:10:25,275
- Hey.

942
01:10:27,205 --> 01:10:28,969
- What're you up to?

943
01:10:28,970 --> 01:10:29,970
- Nothing.

944
01:10:32,170 --> 01:10:33,519
- Where are you going?

945
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:34,763
- None of your business.

946
01:10:35,990 --> 01:10:37,259
- Sorry.

947
01:10:37,260 --> 01:10:38,260
- Sorry.

948
01:10:39,150 --> 01:10:42,083
I'm going to the
hospital to see my mom.

949
01:10:44,190 --> 01:10:46,229
- Isn't that a long way away?

950
01:10:46,230 --> 01:10:47,230
- Yeah.

951
01:10:49,980 --> 01:10:51,979
- Hey, that flashlight
come in handy?

952
01:10:51,980 --> 01:10:52,980
- Yeah.

953
01:10:56,490 --> 01:10:59,339
- My dad told me about
the wreck, about your mom.

954
01:10:59,340 --> 01:11:00,840
- I don't wanna talk about it.

955
01:11:01,970 --> 01:11:02,970
- Okay.

956
01:11:05,680 --> 01:11:10,109
My mom died like two
years ago from cancer.

957
01:11:10,110 --> 01:11:11,110
- I'm sorry.

958
01:11:12,100 --> 01:11:13,759
- Thanks.

959
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:15,123
It was like so unfair.

960
01:11:16,773 --> 01:11:18,369
- I bet you miss her a lot.

961
01:11:18,370 --> 01:11:20,699
I mean, I'm sure you do.

962
01:11:20,700 --> 01:11:22,019
- Yeah.

963
01:11:22,020 --> 01:11:25,349
Your grandma watched me
when my dad had to work.

964
01:11:25,350 --> 01:11:28,323
She kinda always knew what to
say when I was feeling bad.

965
01:11:29,937 --> 01:11:32,239
- Do you think about
your mom a lot?

966
01:11:32,240 --> 01:11:33,819
- Yeah.

967
01:11:33,820 --> 01:11:37,958
I mean, I would've done anything
to save her but, you know.

968
01:11:37,959 --> 01:11:39,099
- Anything?

969
01:11:39,100 --> 01:11:40,100
- Yeah.

970
01:11:44,510 --> 01:11:46,739
You want me to come with you?

971
01:11:46,740 --> 01:11:49,129
- It's probably too far away.

972
01:11:49,130 --> 01:11:50,010
- Okay.

973
01:11:50,010 --> 01:11:50,843
- Thanks.

974
01:11:50,843 --> 01:11:51,843
- No problem.

975
01:11:57,220 --> 01:11:58,333
- Where are you?

976
01:12:00,246 --> 01:12:01,413
Where are you?

977
01:12:04,661 --> 01:12:06,161
- [Elf] Over here.

978
01:12:11,620 --> 01:12:12,840
- I'll do it.

979
01:12:12,841 --> 01:12:15,239
I'll let you pass
into this world

980
01:12:15,240 --> 01:12:17,190
but I want more time
to find the heart.

981
01:12:18,656 --> 01:12:19,937
(ominous music)

982
01:12:19,938 --> 01:12:21,940
- [Elf] No more
time, little bird.

983
01:12:24,334 --> 01:12:26,109
- Then I won't let you in.

984
01:12:26,110 --> 01:12:27,689
(elf chuckling)

985
01:12:27,690 --> 01:12:29,833
- [Elf] Because
this is so very fun,

986
01:12:31,336 --> 01:12:34,569
I'll give you one more night.

987
01:12:34,570 --> 01:12:36,569
- That's not enough time.

988
01:12:36,570 --> 01:12:38,413
- [Elf] That is my offer.

989
01:12:40,931 --> 01:12:43,598
(ominous music)

990
01:12:52,473 --> 01:12:55,056
(gentle music)

991
01:12:56,040 --> 01:12:58,397
- I bet the Fire Elf
has the heart with him.

992
01:13:00,518 --> 01:13:02,893
That's what Grandma
meant by a twist.

993
01:13:04,801 --> 01:13:07,887
We have to go if we're
going to find the real one.

994
01:13:10,219 --> 01:13:13,302
(lively tempo music)

995
01:13:21,330 --> 01:13:24,419
- [Beth] And he waits out
there, bitter as ever,

996
01:13:24,420 --> 01:13:27,187
looking for a way
out into our world.

997
01:13:29,734 --> 01:13:30,984
- The Fire Elf.

998
01:13:32,097 --> 01:13:34,847
(dramatic music)

999
01:13:45,092 --> 01:13:48,175
(lively tempo music)

1000
01:13:58,781 --> 01:14:01,364
(somber music)

1001
01:14:10,903 --> 01:14:11,903
Holy Moly.

1002
01:14:15,319 --> 01:14:18,236
(foreboding music)

1003
01:14:25,651 --> 01:14:28,401
(fire crackling)

1004
01:14:35,619 --> 01:14:37,377
(ominous music)

1005
01:14:37,378 --> 01:14:38,378
No!

1006
01:15:04,657 --> 01:15:06,740
There's that man in rags.

1007
01:15:14,497 --> 01:15:17,080
(gentle music)

1008
01:15:28,823 --> 01:15:31,906
(somber tempo music)

1009
01:15:53,522 --> 01:15:56,272
(fire crackling)

1010
01:16:11,035 --> 01:16:13,868
(water trickling)

1011
01:16:50,051 --> 01:16:52,884
(uplifting music)

1012
01:16:57,048 --> 01:16:59,965
(foreboding music)

1013
01:17:12,576 --> 01:17:15,159
(Lily sighing)

1014
01:17:24,297 --> 01:17:26,880
(elf slurping)

1015
01:17:36,217 --> 01:17:38,717
(eerie music)

1016
01:17:49,589 --> 01:17:52,422
(uplifting music)

1017
01:17:54,722 --> 01:17:57,805
(lively tempo music)

1018
01:18:08,727 --> 01:18:11,394
(ominous music)

1019
01:18:18,468 --> 01:18:21,551
(lively tempo music)

1020
01:18:31,736 --> 01:18:33,691
- What do we have here?

1021
01:18:33,692 --> 01:18:36,359
(intense music)

1022
01:18:37,483 --> 01:18:40,483
(suspenseful music)

1023
01:18:42,874 --> 01:18:44,041
Run, run, run.

1024
01:18:47,478 --> 01:18:50,291
(dramatic music)

1025
01:18:50,292 --> 01:18:52,959
(fire rumbling)

1026
01:18:56,592 --> 01:18:58,549
- Aunt Martha's house!

1027
01:18:58,550 --> 01:19:00,933
Aunt Martha's house!

1028
01:19:00,934 --> 01:19:04,184
(atmosphere whooshing)

1029
01:19:05,164 --> 01:19:08,472
(liquid bubbling)

1030
01:19:08,473 --> 01:19:11,223
(fire crackling)

1031
01:19:21,792 --> 01:19:23,837
- You like your cage?

1032
01:19:23,838 --> 01:19:24,917
- No.

1033
01:19:24,918 --> 01:19:25,918
- [Elf] Aw.

1034
01:19:26,690 --> 01:19:29,349
- I have it and now
she'll get better.

1035
01:19:29,350 --> 01:19:32,229
- What did you
find, little bird?

1036
01:19:32,230 --> 01:19:33,509
(elf laughing)

1037
01:19:33,510 --> 01:19:35,479
- The real heart, I found it.

1038
01:19:35,480 --> 01:19:38,170
(elf laughing)

1039
01:19:38,171 --> 01:19:39,838
- Silly little bird.

1040
01:19:40,936 --> 01:19:42,436
Trapped in a cage.

1041
01:19:43,683 --> 01:19:45,909
You found nothing!

1042
01:19:45,910 --> 01:19:47,709
- I did, I...

1043
01:19:47,710 --> 01:19:48,710
No!

1044
01:19:49,951 --> 01:19:53,343
- The only lies are those
you've been telling yourself!

1045
01:19:55,200 --> 01:19:58,013
There's one thing
that remains true.

1046
01:19:59,040 --> 01:20:00,193
Across all worlds.

1047
01:20:01,411 --> 01:20:02,828
Everyone is eager

1048
01:20:04,550 --> 01:20:05,790
to bury their pain.

1049
01:20:07,216 --> 01:20:10,703
They're not strong
enough to face it.

1050
01:20:12,130 --> 01:20:15,609
The sun will soon
rise in your world

1051
01:20:15,610 --> 01:20:19,703
and your mother will
die while you're here.

1052
01:20:24,130 --> 01:20:27,466
Here in your cage.

1053
01:20:27,467 --> 01:20:30,671
(elf laughing) (ominous music)

1054
01:20:30,672 --> 01:20:35,672
- No!

1055
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:38,923
Grandma, finish the
story, please, Grandma!

1056
01:20:39,774 --> 01:20:42,524
(dramatic music)

1057
01:20:43,746 --> 01:20:45,496
- [Beth] Little bird?

1058
01:20:47,851 --> 01:20:48,851
- Grandma?

1059
01:20:51,448 --> 01:20:54,269
Grandma, finish the
story, please, Grandma!

1060
01:20:54,270 --> 01:20:56,189
- Only you can do that.

1061
01:20:56,190 --> 01:20:59,139
- But I don't know
where to find the heart.

1062
01:20:59,140 --> 01:21:03,409
- You do but you
must be oh so brave.

1063
01:21:03,410 --> 01:21:04,889
- I'll try.

1064
01:21:04,890 --> 01:21:07,719
- Sometimes we must face things

1065
01:21:07,720 --> 01:21:10,849
that are full of
pain and sorrow.

1066
01:21:10,850 --> 01:21:12,939
That is the way of the world.

1067
01:21:12,940 --> 01:21:13,940
- I can't!

1068
01:21:15,220 --> 01:21:16,220
- You can.

1069
01:21:17,110 --> 01:21:19,483
Be a brave little bird.

1070
01:21:20,662 --> 01:21:21,912
- No, don't go!

1071
01:21:27,985 --> 01:21:31,235
(dramatic tempo music)

1072
01:21:33,318 --> 01:21:34,651
The man in rags.

1073
01:21:35,736 --> 01:21:37,069
The man in rags.

1074
01:21:38,211 --> 01:21:41,406
(atmosphere whooshing)

1075
01:21:41,407 --> 01:21:44,324
(liquid trickling)

1076
01:21:47,672 --> 01:21:50,422
(dramatic music)

1077
01:22:04,008 --> 01:22:06,758
(sinister music)

1078
01:22:27,044 --> 01:22:29,794
(dramatic music)

1079
01:22:35,843 --> 01:22:39,449
- Your mom's in the hospital.

1080
01:22:39,450 --> 01:22:40,459
Your dad was driving

1081
01:22:40,460 --> 01:22:43,633
and the other car hit
the driver's side.

1082
01:22:45,550 --> 01:22:46,550
He didn't make it.

1083
01:22:49,418 --> 01:22:50,983
Do you understand, Lily?

1084
01:22:52,350 --> 01:22:53,353
Your dad died.

1085
01:22:55,684 --> 01:22:57,307
I am so sorry, honey.

1086
01:23:01,547 --> 01:23:02,603
Lily!

1087
01:23:02,604 --> 01:23:06,437
(dramatic instrumental music)

1088
01:23:34,631 --> 01:23:37,714
(gentle piano music)

1089
01:23:48,920 --> 01:23:50,958
- Everything came
from one point,

1090
01:23:50,959 --> 01:23:52,543
so we're all one thing.

1091
01:23:52,544 --> 01:23:55,294
(pleasant music)

1092
01:24:00,305 --> 01:24:03,472
- All the memories,
even the bad ones.

1093
01:24:10,588 --> 01:24:13,421
(uplifting music)

1094
01:24:28,813 --> 01:24:31,467
- [Elf] Give that to me!

1095
01:24:31,468 --> 01:24:33,747
(suspenseful music)

1096
01:24:33,748 --> 01:24:35,248
- Aunt Martha's...

1097
01:24:37,540 --> 01:24:40,623
(gentle flute music)

1098
01:24:43,796 --> 01:24:46,046
- [Elf] That belongs to me!

1099
01:24:48,450 --> 01:24:49,846
- No it doesn't.

1100
01:24:49,847 --> 01:24:54,047
- I'll have you all in cages!

1101
01:24:54,048 --> 01:24:55,048
Every...

1102
01:24:56,765 --> 01:24:57,765
last...

1103
01:24:58,900 --> 01:25:00,539
one of you.

1104
01:25:00,540 --> 01:25:01,540
- Come on then.

1105
01:25:02,657 --> 01:25:05,389
(sparks fizzling)

1106
01:25:05,390 --> 01:25:07,973
(Elf groaning)

1107
01:25:13,900 --> 01:25:16,629
You're the one who's
scared and weak.

1108
01:25:16,630 --> 01:25:19,273
- You live on people's
fears but I'm not scared.

1109
01:25:20,399 --> 01:25:21,399
- You...

1110
01:25:22,319 --> 01:25:23,319
should be...

1111
01:25:24,920 --> 01:25:27,670
(dramatic music)

1112
01:25:32,756 --> 01:25:35,589
(sparks fizzling)

1113
01:25:40,036 --> 01:25:43,286
(dramatic choir music)

1114
01:25:51,313 --> 01:25:54,396
(lively tempo music)

1115
01:26:25,257 --> 01:26:28,007
(fire crackling)

1116
01:26:29,341 --> 01:26:31,841
(Lily crying)

1117
01:26:37,561 --> 01:26:38,728
- Aunt Martha.

1118
01:26:39,679 --> 01:26:40,679
Aunt Martha.

1119
01:26:41,615 --> 01:26:42,615
Aunt Martha.

1120
01:26:45,630 --> 01:26:46,630
Aunt Martha.

1121
01:26:48,342 --> 01:26:49,657
Dad.

1122
01:26:49,658 --> 01:26:51,063
Dad.

1123
01:26:51,064 --> 01:26:52,205
Dad.

1124
01:26:52,206 --> 01:26:53,710
- It's okay.

1125
01:26:53,711 --> 01:26:56,794
(gentle piano music)

1126
01:26:57,657 --> 01:26:58,819
It's okay. (Lily crying)

1127
01:26:58,820 --> 01:26:59,820
It'll be.

1128
01:27:07,383 --> 01:27:10,716
(heart monitor beeping)

1129
01:27:14,728 --> 01:27:17,978
(pleasant tempo music)

1130
01:27:54,290 --> 01:27:56,495
(birds chirping)

1131
01:27:56,496 --> 01:27:59,419
- [Lily] No one lives forever.

1132
01:27:59,420 --> 01:28:00,813
Not even in stories.

1133
01:28:03,244 --> 01:28:05,219
But if you remember them,

1134
01:28:05,220 --> 01:28:07,133
maybe they're still kinda there.

1135
01:28:08,700 --> 01:28:09,700
I think so.

1136
01:28:11,727 --> 01:28:14,310
(gentle music)

1137
01:28:32,070 --> 01:28:33,070
- You missing her?

1138
01:28:41,590 --> 01:28:42,590
Me too.

1139
01:28:53,333 --> 01:28:55,279
- Do you guys
wanna hear a story?

1140
01:28:55,280 --> 01:28:56,376
- Sure.
- Yeah.

1141
01:28:56,377 --> 01:29:01,169
- You know, your Grandma,
she could tell great stories.

1142
01:29:01,170 --> 01:29:02,170
- The best.

1143
01:29:04,967 --> 01:29:05,967
- I know.

1144
01:29:06,910 --> 01:29:10,159
Once upon a time, there
was a happy little family.

1145
01:29:10,160 --> 01:29:13,268
They loved to dance
in the kitchen

1146
01:29:13,269 --> 01:29:17,348
and go watch the stars
outside at night together.

1147
01:29:17,349 --> 01:29:20,465
There was a mom,
a dad, their kid,

1148
01:29:20,466 --> 01:29:22,378
an aunt, (women laughing)

1149
01:29:22,379 --> 01:29:23,546
and a grandma.

1150
01:29:25,070 --> 01:29:29,169
One day, the little girl went
traveling to three worlds.

1151
01:29:29,170 --> 01:29:32,339
In the first world,
there was a maiden

1152
01:29:32,340 --> 01:29:35,147
and she had a spell
of vanity on her.

1153
01:29:36,342 --> 01:29:39,535
The second world,
in the second world,

1154
01:29:39,536 --> 01:29:41,625
there was a writer.

1155
01:29:41,626 --> 01:29:43,044
He had a spell...

1156
01:29:43,045 --> 01:29:46,878
(pleasant instrumental music)

1157
01:30:17,796 --> 01:30:21,463
(lively instrumental music)

1158
01:30:41,905 --> 01:30:44,488
(somber music)

1159
01:31:15,995 --> 01:31:19,828
(dramatic instrumental music)

1160
01:31:54,814 --> 01:31:58,647
(pleasant instrumental music)

1161
01:32:29,595 --> 01:32:32,678
(lively tempo music)

1162
01:33:07,518 --> 01:33:10,185
(ominous music)

1163
01:33:13,702 --> 01:33:16,702
(suspenseful music)

1164
01:33:24,293 --> 01:33:28,126
(dramatic instrumental music)
