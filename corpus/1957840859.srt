is you don't want to.

- No, I don't.
- Uh-huh.

90

It wouldn't be so hard
if I didn't really

91
00:04:58,866 --> 00:05:02,334
like him a lot, and...

92

93

94

dating other women?

98
00:05:16,217 --> 00:05:18,717
Not really. She'd like
it to be more serious,

99
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:21,286
but, you know, I like
to keep my options open.

100
00:05:21,388 --> 00:05:24,256
Yeah, I get it. Maybe meet
someone the old-fashioned way.

101
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,027

couldn't be worse.

right now to look at it?

00:08:42,623 --> 00:08:47,225
but, um, I think treatments
have been rough this round, so.

182
00:08:48,295 --> 00:08:49,306
- Oh.
- Yeah.

183
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:50,862
Uh, love you guys. Bye.

184
00:08:50,964 --> 00:08:52,564
- Bye.
- See ya!

185
00:08:55,336 --> 00:08:57,502
(people laughing)

186
00:08:57,604 --> 00:09:00,539
so, you knit scarves while
you watch scary movies.

187
00:09:00,641 --> 00:09:02,519
(laughing) well, I
weirdly love them,

188
00:09:02,543 --> 00:09:06,044
but they freak me out, so
knitting calms my nerves.

189
00:09:06,146 --> 00:09:07,590
(chuckling) okay.

190
00:09:07,614 --> 00:09:10,115
Scarves, zombies,
running marathons,

191
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:12,262
and what else do you do when
you're not computer programming?

192
00:09:12,286 --> 00:09:13,652
Uh, I raise my son.

193
00:09:13,754 --> 00:09:14,619
Oh.

194
00:09:14,722 --> 00:09:16,132
When he lets me.
We're really close,

195
00:09:16,156 --> 00:09:18,690
but he's almost 16 now.

196
00:09:18,792 --> 00:09:20,352
- Yeah.
- So.

197
00:09:21,395 --> 00:09:22,427
Hm.

198
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:23,695
He's got his dad's hair.

199
00:09:23,797 --> 00:09:25,831
He's not in the
picture, his dad.

200
00:09:27,101 --> 00:09:29,034
I...

201
00:09:29,136 --> 00:09:30,569
That's embarrassing.

202
00:09:30,671 --> 00:09:32,938
We broke up a long time ago.

203
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,842
Actually, right around the time
we found out I was pregnant.

204
00:09:36,944 --> 00:09:38,188
We tried to stay together,
but it didn't work out.

205
00:09:38,212 --> 00:09:39,277
That's rough.

206
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:40,479
Daddy!

207
00:09:40,581 --> 00:09:41,880
He wasn't ideal.

208
00:09:41,982 --> 00:09:44,094
Oh, that takes care of me
asking if you have kids.

209
00:09:44,118 --> 00:09:45,450
Two actually. Hey, guys.

210
00:09:45,552 --> 00:09:46,618
(laughing)

211
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,552
hey.

212
00:09:47,654 --> 00:09:48,687
I'm emily.

213
00:09:48,789 --> 00:09:50,188
Oh!

214
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:52,702
Guys, come on, let's leave daddy
and his friend alone, okay?

215
00:09:52,726 --> 00:09:53,837
- Why?
- No!

216
00:09:53,861 --> 00:09:55,026
Go. Now.

217
00:09:55,129 --> 00:09:56,161
See you guys.

218
00:10:00,801 --> 00:10:04,403
Oh, right. Sara, this is cari.

219
00:10:04,505 --> 00:10:05,871
Both: Hi.

220
00:10:05,973 --> 00:10:07,584
So sorry they
interrupted like that.

221
00:10:07,608 --> 00:10:08,940
Oh, it's totally okay.

222
00:10:09,042 --> 00:10:10,575
It's really okay, yeah.

223
00:10:10,677 --> 00:10:12,789
Anyways, I was just picking
up some take-out, so.

224
00:10:12,813 --> 00:10:14,224
It was really nice
to meet you, cari.

225
00:10:14,248 --> 00:10:15,313
You, too.

226
00:10:15,416 --> 00:10:16,581
Have fun.

227
00:10:16,683 --> 00:10:18,323
- (laughing)
- bye.

228
00:10:19,453 --> 00:10:20,685
(chuckling)

229
00:10:20,788 --> 00:10:23,588
yeah, that is not how I
planned on this going.

230
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:26,825
It's okay. I mean, it
definitely made it memorable.

231
00:10:26,927 --> 00:10:30,562
Maybe I can get a
do-over sometime?

232
00:10:30,664 --> 00:10:34,466
Well, it's still early.

233
00:10:38,739 --> 00:10:40,005
Alright, here we are.

234
00:10:42,009 --> 00:10:43,041
Oh.

235
00:10:47,848 --> 00:10:49,114
(phone vibrating)

236
00:10:51,051 --> 00:10:52,584
nice place.

237
00:10:52,686 --> 00:10:54,486
- Yeah, right?
- (laughing)

238
00:10:55,289 --> 00:10:56,455
when sara and I split up

239
00:10:56,557 --> 00:11:00,025
I didn't have a lot of
money for furniture, so.

240
00:11:00,127 --> 00:11:02,761
Well, it's bringing me
back to my college days,

241
00:11:02,863 --> 00:11:07,032
and who doesn't love
that time in their life?

242
00:11:07,134 --> 00:11:08,033
Yeah.

243
00:11:08,135 --> 00:11:09,935
(buzzing)

244
00:11:10,037 --> 00:11:13,138
um, I got a bordeaux.

245
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,106
(buzzing)

246
00:11:15,209 --> 00:11:16,441

(buzzing)

248
00:11:20,614 --> 00:11:22,280
yeah?

249
00:11:22,382 --> 00:11:25,016
Liz: Dave, I've been
trying to reach you.

250
00:11:25,118 --> 00:11:26,017
What is it?

251
00:11:26,119 --> 00:11:27,530
I lost my keys. I've
looked everywhere.

252
00:11:27,554 --> 00:11:30,689
I can't get into my place, which
is why I was texting you...

253
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:31,831
I have a spare set.

254
00:11:34,528 --> 00:11:35,594
I'll be right down.

255
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:38,029

I'm going to go.

No, no, no. You sh... no, no.

258
00:11:41,301 --> 00:11:42,812
This will not take
long. You should stay.

259
00:11:42,836 --> 00:11:44,569
It's getting late.

00:11:48,609 --> 00:11:50,175

262
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:57,616
Thank you.

263
00:12:00,287 --> 00:12:01,953
So sorry about this.

264
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:03,121
Yeah, it's, um...

265
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:06,191
Fine.

266
00:12:06,293 --> 00:12:07,659
Your date just got cut short,

267
00:12:07,761 --> 00:12:11,196
and I just left the
worst date ever.

268
00:12:11,298 --> 00:12:13,465
You wanna have a quick drink?

269
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:15,934
You know, I actually
am pretty beat,

270
00:12:16,036 --> 00:12:18,537
so I think I'm just
going to call it a night.

271
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:24,376
Rain check.

272
00:12:24,478 --> 00:12:25,944
You're a life saver.

273
00:12:26,046 --> 00:12:27,046
See you soon.

274
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:48,366
That was fast.

275
00:12:48,468 --> 00:12:50,468
Come on in.

276
00:12:50,571 --> 00:12:52,904
Thanks for, uh...

277
00:12:53,006 --> 00:12:55,126
Thanks for being so
cool about everything.

278
00:12:55,909 --> 00:12:57,109
Honestly, that was nothing.

279
00:12:59,012 --> 00:13:02,781
The last guy I dated, um,

280
00:13:02,883 --> 00:13:04,661
he ran into me one night
when I was out for dinner

281
00:13:04,685 --> 00:13:07,018
with a co-worker sushi dayo,

282
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:11,222
and he thought we were
together, and he lost his mind.

283
00:13:11,325 --> 00:13:13,124
Almost got physical.

284
00:13:13,226 --> 00:13:14,704
(groaning) sounds
like a nightmare.

285
00:13:14,728 --> 00:13:16,962
Yeah, I was mortified.

286
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:22,233
But we're all old enough that

287
00:13:22,336 --> 00:13:24,480
we've accumulated some
baggage, so I get it.

288
00:13:24,504 --> 00:13:25,670

being brutally honest,

290
00:13:33,814 --> 00:13:36,348
before we were interrupted,
I was actually working up

291
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:39,184
the nerve to kiss you.

292
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:41,653
Oh, really?

293
00:13:41,755 --> 00:13:42,755

that that's all it is.

545
00:28:41,487 --> 00:28:43,087

546
00:28:44,257 --> 00:28:45,257

Detective: Know
anything about that?

549
00:28:50,713 --> 00:28:52,913
No, I haven't seen
her in months.

550
00:28:53,015 --> 00:28:54,815
How long were you dating?

551
00:28:54,917 --> 00:28:55,950
It was brief.

552
00:28:56,052 --> 00:28:57,252
She's the one who ended it?

553
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:59,220
Yeah.

554
00:28:59,322 --> 00:29:01,155
Because?

555
00:29:01,257 --> 00:29:02,701
I don't know. You'd
have to ask her.

556
00:29:02,725 --> 00:29:04,725
Oh, but I guess
you can't, can you?

557
00:29:07,296 --> 00:29:09,341
Could it be that you tried
to run her off the road?

558
00:29:09,365 --> 00:29:10,943
Is that what she
said? No, no. Look.

559
00:29:10,967 --> 00:29:12,132
I was protecting her.

560
00:29:12,235 --> 00:29:13,634
By tailing her?

561
00:29:13,736 --> 00:29:15,981
No, by following her home to
make sure she got home safely.

562
00:29:16,005 --> 00:29:18,072
She almost got into an accident.

563
00:29:18,174 --> 00:29:20,686
Well, I don't know, maybe she
swerved to avoid hitting a cat.

564
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:24,845
Look, we were drinking.
We both drove separately.

565
00:29:24,947 --> 00:29:26,692
So, I followed her home to
make sure she got home safely,

566
00:29:26,716 --> 00:29:29,583
then I continued on to my place,
which is four blocks past hers.

567
00:29:32,421 --> 00:29:34,855
Look, is that all? 'cause
I gotta get back to work.

568
00:29:34,957 --> 00:29:36,690
Go.

569
00:29:36,792 --> 00:29:37,825
Thanks.

570
00:29:44,867 --> 00:29:48,502
So, I'm going to take you
to your practice at 3:00

571
00:29:48,604 --> 00:29:50,682
and then we're going to have
dinner with jacob and hillary,

572
00:29:50,706 --> 00:29:52,317
and I thought maybe
you could help me

573
00:29:52,341 --> 00:29:54,008
make the spaghetti sauce?

574
00:29:56,012 --> 00:29:58,212
I have geometry homework.

575
00:29:58,314 --> 00:29:59,446
Okay.

576
00:30:01,751 --> 00:30:03,150
Maybe next time.

577
00:30:03,252 --> 00:30:04,585
(phone vibrating)

578
00:30:04,687 --> 00:30:08,122

579
00:30:08,224 --> 00:30:10,391
(sighing)

580
00:30:10,493 --> 00:30:11,358
what?

581
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:12,571
Did she ever mention to you

582
00:30:12,595 --> 00:30:15,362
anything about a job in kansas?

583
00:30:18,434 --> 00:30:20,501
Maybe, yeah, like, a month ago,

584
00:30:20,603 --> 00:30:24,004
but then she got a raise
and she decided that she was

585
00:30:24,106 --> 00:30:25,172
going to stay here.

586
00:30:25,274 --> 00:30:26,807
Why?

587
00:30:26,909 --> 00:30:29,877
Because she says she's moving
to wichita for some new job

588
00:30:29,979 --> 00:30:32,646
and that she sold all
of your furniture.

589
00:30:32,748 --> 00:30:35,416
No! Wh...

590
00:30:35,518 --> 00:30:36,383
(phone vibrating)

591
00:30:36,485 --> 00:30:37,729
(sighing) wait, this is...

592
00:30:37,753 --> 00:30:40,854
She's just texted me
a picture of a check.

593
00:30:40,956 --> 00:30:43,290
She wants me to let the
buyer into your house

594
00:30:43,392 --> 00:30:46,260
so they can take
away everything.

595
00:30:46,362 --> 00:30:49,663
Tell her that if she
wants to sell everything

596
00:30:49,765 --> 00:30:52,433
that she can come here
and she can do it herself.

597
00:30:52,535 --> 00:30:54,816
Maybe she can stop by and
say hi to her only child

598
00:30:54,904 --> 00:30:57,104
while she's at it.

599
00:30:57,206 --> 00:30:58,305

hang-up today, man.

605

Hey, as your friend
I'm here for you,

606
00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:29,281
but as your manager,
you gotta get this wacko

607
00:31:29,305 --> 00:31:30,170

608

610
00:31:48,424 --> 00:31:49,990
Looking for dave kroupa.

611
00:31:50,092 --> 00:31:51,837
Uh, that's me.
What's this about?

612
00:31:51,861 --> 00:31:54,328
Cari farver. We understand
she's your girlfriend.

613
00:31:54,430 --> 00:31:56,541
I wouldn't call her that.
We only dated a few weeks.

614
00:31:56,565 --> 00:31:57,865
She broke it off last Thursday.

615
00:31:57,967 --> 00:32:00,501
Thursday?

616
00:32:00,603 --> 00:32:02,102
Uh-huh.

617
00:32:02,204 --> 00:32:03,782
Wednesday the 25th is the
last day anyone else saw cari,

618
00:32:03,806 --> 00:32:05,506
according to our information.

619
00:32:05,608 --> 00:32:07,174
Wait, cari's missing?

620
00:32:07,276 --> 00:32:08,942
You don't think I did anything.

621
00:32:09,044 --> 00:32:11,845
Why did the relationship end?

622
00:32:11,947 --> 00:32:14,782
She wanted to move in
together and I said no,

623
00:32:14,884 --> 00:32:16,924
and then she... She
went kind of crazy.

624
00:32:16,952 --> 00:32:17,952
Well, look.

625
00:32:19,221 --> 00:32:20,532
She's been harassing
me and liz golyar,

626
00:32:20,556 --> 00:32:22,856
this other woman
that I'm dating.

627
00:32:27,696 --> 00:32:29,663
Cari know about this?

628
00:32:29,765 --> 00:32:33,300
Yeah, we weren't exclusive.

629
00:32:33,402 --> 00:32:36,236
Would you say cari was
unhappy about your breakup?

630
00:32:36,338 --> 00:32:38,538
Well, if these texts are
any indication, yeah.

631
00:32:38,574 --> 00:32:41,575
She says, "hey, asshole.
You better watch your back.

632
00:32:41,677 --> 00:32:42,976
I know where to find you."

633
00:32:43,078 --> 00:32:44,389
I mean, there's
tons more like that.

634
00:32:44,413 --> 00:32:46,653
So, yeah, I'd say she's
probably pretty unhappy.

635
00:32:50,386 --> 00:32:52,497
Come to the station and we'll
help you file a complaint.

638

you, if you only dated for

639
00:33:18,881 --> 00:33:20,113
a couple of weeks?

640
00:33:20,216 --> 00:33:21,415
Beats me.

641
00:33:21,517 --> 00:33:22,382
And me.

642
00:33:22,485 --> 00:33:25,285
Why's she so fixated on me?

643
00:33:25,387 --> 00:33:27,254
Because she's crazy, clearly.

644
00:33:27,356 --> 00:33:29,990
I just didn't see it.

645
00:33:30,092 --> 00:33:32,192
It's not your fault.

646
00:33:33,863 --> 00:33:37,331
I mean, it's not
entirely your fault.

647

648
00:33:40,870 --> 00:33:43,270

a much worse punishment,

649

make it up to you.

650

00:38:47,576 --> 00:38:50,710
We both have secret
family recipes.

726
00:38:50,813 --> 00:38:52,312
Mine being the best, obviously.

727
00:38:52,414 --> 00:38:54,494
- Okay, we'll see about that.
- We will.

728
00:38:54,583 --> 00:38:56,461
(sighing) which one
should I try first?

729
00:38:56,485 --> 00:38:59,052
- Mine?
- Mine.

730
00:38:59,154 --> 00:39:00,654
(phone chiming)

731
00:39:00,756 --> 00:39:04,024
oh, that might be my kids.

732
00:39:08,964 --> 00:39:10,831
Everything okay?

733
00:39:10,933 --> 00:39:13,166
Uh, yeah.

734
00:39:15,871 --> 00:39:17,804
"I spy with my little eye,

735
00:39:17,906 --> 00:39:21,474
"you wearing a blue shirt
and eating apple pie"?

736
00:39:23,579 --> 00:39:25,745
Cari. She's watching?

737
00:39:25,848 --> 00:39:27,514
I don't know.

738
00:39:27,616 --> 00:39:29,516
Oh my god.

739
00:39:31,386 --> 00:39:33,553
(phone chiming)

740
00:39:33,655 --> 00:39:36,122
how did she get my number?

741
00:39:36,225 --> 00:39:37,958
Wait. Are you serious?

742
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:39,470
- She texted you?
- Dave: No way.

743
00:39:39,494 --> 00:39:40,894
Camila: What does it say?

744
00:39:40,996 --> 00:39:43,263
It's a link...

745
00:39:43,365 --> 00:39:45,866
To an obituary.

746
00:39:45,968 --> 00:39:48,902
"I didn't know liz
golyar very well,

747
00:39:49,004 --> 00:39:50,348
"except that she
was a man-stealer

748
00:39:50,372 --> 00:39:54,140
"and a whore.

749
00:39:54,243 --> 00:39:55,976
"rest in peace, liz.

750
00:39:56,078 --> 00:39:58,879
"maybe her ugly
kids will be next."

751
00:40:07,689 --> 00:40:08,588
(water running)

752
00:40:08,690 --> 00:40:10,690
(phone chiming)

753
00:40:13,829 --> 00:40:15,262
(phone chiming)

754
00:40:16,598 --> 00:40:18,031
(sighing)

755
00:40:19,368 --> 00:40:21,301
what?

756
00:40:22,571 --> 00:40:26,973
(phone chiming)

757
00:40:29,411 --> 00:40:31,745
- (phone ringing)
- oh, come on, pick up. Pick up.

758
00:40:31,847 --> 00:40:33,324
Liz (recorded:) hi
there, howdy! It's liz.

759
00:40:33,348 --> 00:40:34,459
- Damn it!
- You know what to do.

760
00:40:34,483 --> 00:40:36,194
Liz, liz, hey. It's dave.

761
00:40:36,218 --> 00:40:37,562
Call me back as soon
as you get this, okay?

762
00:40:37,586 --> 00:40:39,746
It's urgent. I'm on my
way to your house now.

763
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,826
Damn it.

764
00:40:53,902 --> 00:40:55,769
Liz?! Liz?!

765
00:40:55,871 --> 00:40:58,104
Liz! Are you in there?

766
00:41:00,409 --> 00:41:02,409
Liz?!

767
00:41:06,415 --> 00:41:08,248
(phone ringing)

768
00:41:08,350 --> 00:41:09,683
hey, this is dave kroupa.

769
00:41:09,785 --> 00:41:11,229
I just found cari's
car in my parking lot.

770
00:41:11,253 --> 00:41:12,530
I need you to get
here right away.

771
00:41:12,554 --> 00:41:13,665
Detective adams: Let
me talk to miller.

772
00:41:13,689 --> 00:41:14,521
Now! Now!

773
00:41:14,623 --> 00:41:18,959
(siren sounding)

774
00:41:22,097 --> 00:41:24,331
(siren sounding)

775
00:41:26,802 --> 00:41:28,168
(straining)

776
00:41:29,271 --> 00:41:30,570
(straining)

777
00:41:30,672 --> 00:41:31,816
officer: If I could get
everyone here to stand back,

778
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:33,440
give us some space. Thank you.

779
00:41:36,378 --> 00:41:38,778
All clear.

780
00:41:40,449 --> 00:41:42,849
I could send a patrol car to
liz's house to check on her.

781
00:41:42,884 --> 00:41:44,951
Okay. Okay.

782
00:41:45,053 --> 00:41:47,320
- (phone vibrating)
- it's liz. It's liz!

783
00:41:47,422 --> 00:41:49,589
Hey, are you okay?

784
00:41:49,691 --> 00:41:50,969
Liz: Yeah, I'm fine.

785
00:41:50,993 --> 00:41:52,603
- Good, good.
- Liz: What's going on?

786
00:41:52,627 --> 00:41:54,872
- You're scaring me.
- No, no, no. Everything's okay.

787
00:41:54,896 --> 00:41:56,140
I'll explain later. I
just... I think it's better

788
00:41:56,164 --> 00:41:57,442
if I stay at your
house tonight, okay?

789
00:41:57,466 --> 00:41:58,531
Liz: Okay.

790
00:41:58,633 --> 00:42:01,801
Okay, great. I'll
be right over.

791
00:42:06,108 --> 00:42:07,819
You have no idea
how terrible I feel

792
00:42:07,843 --> 00:42:10,176
for dragging you
into this nightmare.

793
00:42:10,278 --> 00:42:14,247
Well... There are a lot
of whack jobs out there.

794
00:42:14,349 --> 00:42:16,016
You got unlucky.

795
00:42:17,953 --> 00:42:20,520
Don't get me wrong,
I'm still pissed at you

796
00:42:20,622 --> 00:42:23,356
for bringing this
lunatic into our lives.

797
00:42:23,458 --> 00:42:25,425
Yet, you didn't just bail.

798
00:42:28,430 --> 00:42:31,731
My stomach drops every
time I get a text.

799
00:42:31,833 --> 00:42:33,793
I change my number,
she finds it.

800
00:42:33,835 --> 00:42:36,436
I block her, she star 67s or
calls from a different number.

801
00:42:36,538 --> 00:42:38,282
- (phone vibrating)
- was that her?

802
00:42:38,306 --> 00:42:41,341
No. It's a telemarketer.

803
00:42:42,878 --> 00:42:45,089
Who knew I'd ever be so
happy to get a spam call?

804
00:42:45,113 --> 00:42:46,312
(laughing)

805
00:42:46,415 --> 00:42:48,281
god, I can't take this anymore.

806
00:42:48,383 --> 00:42:49,616
(phone chiming)

807
00:42:56,024 --> 00:42:58,625
"you are a worthless whore, liz.

808
00:42:58,727 --> 00:43:01,694
"yesterday was a warning.

809
00:43:01,797 --> 00:43:04,631
"but maybe I really should
do dave and me a favor

810
00:43:04,733 --> 00:43:07,734
"and get rid of you and
your bratty kids for good."

811
00:43:07,836 --> 00:43:11,137
jesus.

812
00:43:11,239 --> 00:43:14,140
Hey, you have to send
that to the detectives.

813
00:43:26,688 --> 00:43:28,788
Hey, aunt nancy.

814
00:43:28,890 --> 00:43:31,624
Holding up okay?

815
00:43:33,328 --> 00:43:36,629
(voice breaking:)
yeah. I'm okay.

816
00:43:36,731 --> 00:43:39,032
I just can't believe

817
00:43:39,134 --> 00:43:40,878
that cari missed her
father's funeral.

818
00:43:40,902 --> 00:43:43,269
She really didn't call?

819
00:43:43,371 --> 00:43:45,839
And sam still hasn't
heard anything either?

820
00:43:45,941 --> 00:43:49,909
Just an apology for
not being here today...

821
00:43:50,011 --> 00:43:51,744
By text...

822
00:43:51,847 --> 00:43:54,881
With this little exclamation
point at the end,

823
00:43:54,983 --> 00:43:57,083
like she was...

824
00:43:57,185 --> 00:44:00,487
Missing some sort of
casual Sunday dinner.

825
00:44:02,457 --> 00:44:03,857
No more texts.

826
00:44:03,959 --> 00:44:06,259
Cari, if you want to
communicate with me,

827
00:44:06,361 --> 00:44:10,196
it needs to be in
person or by phone.

828
00:44:10,298 --> 00:44:12,265
Yes. And?

829
00:44:12,367 --> 00:44:15,535
She just texted me
back and she said...

830
00:44:15,637 --> 00:44:18,304
I've always been so controlling

831
00:44:18,406 --> 00:44:20,106
and that I'm a bad mother.

832
00:44:21,643 --> 00:44:25,411
Well, we both know
that's not true.

833
00:44:25,514 --> 00:44:27,680
(sniffling)

834
00:44:27,782 --> 00:44:30,750
you're wonderful.

835
00:44:30,852 --> 00:44:33,219
It's okay.

836
00:44:33,321 --> 00:44:36,789
Thank you. (sighing)

837
00:44:36,892 --> 00:44:40,059
car's dusted and
there are no prints

838
00:44:40,162 --> 00:44:42,428
inside or out, except one,

839
00:44:42,531 --> 00:44:44,308
on a mint tin in
the center console.

840
00:44:44,332 --> 00:44:46,633
Anyone turn up?

841
00:44:46,735 --> 00:44:48,975
No, and it doesn't match
anyone on the database.

842
00:44:57,479 --> 00:45:00,580
(phone ringing)

843
00:45:00,682 --> 00:45:02,193
- dave: Hey.
- Hey, babe.

844
00:45:02,217 --> 00:45:04,228
Dave: Everything okay?
I'm still at work.

845
00:45:04,252 --> 00:45:06,753
Yeah, fine, just checking to see

846
00:45:06,855 --> 00:45:08,366
if you heard anything
from the cops.

847
00:45:08,390 --> 00:45:10,401
Yeah. They said the picture
of you tied up in the car

848
00:45:10,425 --> 00:45:11,425
was photoshopped.

849
00:45:11,526 --> 00:45:13,459
(gasping) oh my god!

850
00:45:13,562 --> 00:45:14,694
Dave, my house!

851
00:45:14,796 --> 00:45:16,162
Dave: What?

852
00:45:16,264 --> 00:45:17,742
What? What's happened? Liz?

853
00:45:17,766 --> 00:45:20,366
- Liz: Holy...
- Dave: Liz? Hello?

854
00:45:20,468 --> 00:45:22,502
Liz, what's going on? Hello?!

855
00:45:22,604 --> 00:45:25,238
Oh my god.

856
00:45:28,276 --> 00:45:30,610
(coughing)

857
00:45:34,416 --> 00:45:35,481
liz! Liz!

858
00:45:35,584 --> 00:45:37,517
(liz sobbing)

859
00:45:37,619 --> 00:45:39,018
you okay? Are you okay?

860
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:41,754
They're gone, dave.

861
00:45:41,856 --> 00:45:43,501
(sobbing) they're gone.

862
00:45:43,525 --> 00:45:44,857
Wait, wait. What? What?

863
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:46,960
(sobbing) they're dead.

864
00:45:47,062 --> 00:45:49,729
Whiskey and marbles,

865
00:45:49,831 --> 00:45:51,197
they're dead.

866
00:45:51,299 --> 00:45:54,367
They died in the
fire. They're gone.

867
00:45:59,074 --> 00:46:02,075
Mr. Kroupa?

868
00:46:02,177 --> 00:46:04,310
We're waiting for confirmation.

869
00:46:04,412 --> 00:46:06,913
But the investigators
are thinking

870
00:46:07,015 --> 00:46:10,950
that this is most likely
an intentionally set fire.

871
00:46:11,052 --> 00:46:13,453
Oh my god.

872
00:46:13,555 --> 00:46:18,258
There is just one person who
is sick enough to do this -

873
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:20,760
cari farver.

874
00:46:29,404 --> 00:46:30,982
None of this makes
any sense, right?

875
00:46:31,006 --> 00:46:33,973
I mean, there's no sign
of cari for months,

876
00:46:34,075 --> 00:46:36,442
not a single legitimate
tip on the hotline.

877
00:46:36,544 --> 00:46:38,623
Her only communication
is via text message

878
00:46:38,647 --> 00:46:40,813
or emails sent to dave,
liz, nancy, and sam.

879
00:46:40,915 --> 00:46:43,249
She skips over family events.

880
00:46:43,351 --> 00:46:45,551
(sighing) suddenly, she's
burning down houses?

881
00:46:48,023 --> 00:46:51,157
- What?
- Think about it.

882
00:46:51,259 --> 00:46:53,726
There hasn't been a single
sighting of cari since...

883
00:46:53,828 --> 00:46:55,908
- She disappeared.
- She disappeared.

884
00:46:55,964 --> 00:46:59,666
No sightings of cari,
no recent bank activity,

885
00:46:59,768 --> 00:47:03,369
which makes sense for somebody
who doesn't want to be found...

886
00:47:03,471 --> 00:47:06,939
Or it means that
person is deceased.

887
00:47:07,042 --> 00:47:09,086
Yet, we have no evidence
to suggest that she's dead.

888
00:47:09,110 --> 00:47:11,110
That's true.

889
00:47:11,212 --> 00:47:12,779
But I say we start from scratch.

890
00:47:12,881 --> 00:47:14,091
You try to prove that
cari's still alive,

891
00:47:14,115 --> 00:47:15,726
and I'll try to prove
that she's dead.

892
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:18,418
Okay, if she's alive, then
the question is where is she?

893
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:19,919
And if she's dead,

894
00:47:20,021 --> 00:47:23,389
that means someone else is
sending the texts and emails.

895
00:47:24,993 --> 00:47:28,795
Maybe someone with
tech know-how.

896
00:47:28,897 --> 00:47:30,137
What the hell are you saying?

897
00:47:30,198 --> 00:47:31,309
That I know what
happened to cari?

898
00:47:31,333 --> 00:47:32,699
Miller: No?

899
00:47:32,801 --> 00:47:35,601
I didn't know she was missing.

900
00:47:35,704 --> 00:47:37,704
Jesus...

901
00:47:37,806 --> 00:47:39,972
Do I need a lawyer?

It's pretty clear there's no

You made threats.

907
00:47:49,317 --> 00:47:52,118
Told her she'd regret
putting that r.O. On you.

908
00:47:52,220 --> 00:47:53,664
Regret it because
I didn't lawyer up

909
00:47:53,688 --> 00:47:55,933
and put her ass in debt for
a false restraining order.

910

False. The r.O. States

you were stalking her,
harassing her at work, at home.

Colleague with her

914
00:48:04,899 --> 00:48:06,510

said that you yelled,

00:58:35,413 --> 00:58:37,579
Camila: No, of course
not. It just, you know,

1080
00:58:37,682 --> 00:58:40,716
struck us when we saw you two
at the store the other day.

1081
00:58:40,818 --> 00:58:42,496
I'm sorry, you saw
us at the store

1082
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:43,830
and you didn't
even say anything?

1083
00:58:43,854 --> 00:58:47,022
What? We just didn't
want to interrupt you.

1084
00:58:47,124 --> 00:58:49,692
And then, you said that you
thought sara was stalking us?

1085
00:58:49,794 --> 00:58:52,327
No. I mean...

1086
00:58:52,430 --> 00:58:54,096
It crossed my mind.

1087
00:58:54,198 --> 00:58:56,999
Sara is the one who has a lot
to lose and a lot to gain.

1088
00:58:57,101 --> 00:58:58,634
Are you serious right now?

1089
00:58:58,736 --> 00:59:00,936
It was just a vibe we got.

1090
00:59:01,038 --> 00:59:03,338
A vibe?! You don't know
her, neither of you do.

1091
00:59:03,441 --> 00:59:05,774
Why are you sticking up for her?

1092
00:59:05,876 --> 00:59:08,321
Because she never would have
done all of these crazy things.

1093
00:59:08,345 --> 00:59:11,447
Okay, you know what? Never
mind. Forget about it.

1094
00:59:11,549 --> 00:59:13,160
No, no, no. Sara's
not a psychopath.

1095
00:59:13,184 --> 00:59:14,294
She's a really good person.

1096
00:59:14,318 --> 00:59:16,819
Liz: Wow. Okay, then.
Well, maybe you should

1097
00:59:16,921 --> 00:59:18,699
get back together with sara
because she's such an angel

1098
00:59:18,723 --> 00:59:21,990
and I'm, apparently,
a terrible person

1099
00:59:22,093 --> 00:59:25,527
for thinking anything
horrible about sara.

1100
00:59:25,629 --> 00:59:27,196
That's what you just said.

1101
00:59:27,298 --> 00:59:29,264
So, excuse me for being

1102
00:59:29,366 --> 00:59:31,812
just a little bit traumatized by
everything that has gone down -

1103
00:59:31,836 --> 00:59:33,335
my garage vandalized,

1104
00:59:33,437 --> 00:59:36,438
my house burned
down, my dogs killed,

1105
00:59:36,540 --> 00:59:39,475
and harassing threats
every single day.

1106
00:59:39,577 --> 00:59:42,711
But I got it wrong,
so, you know, sue me.

1107
00:59:42,813 --> 00:59:43,813
Liz, come on.

1108
00:59:43,848 --> 00:59:45,914
Liz: No. Leave me alone.

1109
00:59:49,954 --> 00:59:57,954
♪

1110
01:00:27,258 --> 01:00:32,127
(breathing heavily)

1111
01:00:35,666 --> 01:00:39,334
(gun cocking)

1112
01:00:39,436 --> 01:00:40,436
(gun firing)

1113
01:00:48,012 --> 01:00:50,045
hey. Hey. Is she okay?

1114
01:00:50,147 --> 01:00:51,591
They were able to
remove the bullet,

1115
01:00:51,615 --> 01:00:52,692
but she's still in surgery.

1116
01:00:52,716 --> 01:00:54,161
Well, is she going
to be all right?

1117
01:00:54,185 --> 01:00:55,629
Well, should know
more in an hour or so.

1118
01:00:55,653 --> 01:00:57,986
This is insane. Who
would shoot her?

1119
01:00:58,088 --> 01:01:00,289
Council bluffs pd are
still at the scene.

1120
01:01:00,391 --> 01:01:01,890
But liz identified the suspect.

1121
01:01:01,992 --> 01:01:04,459
Who was it? Was it cari?

1122
01:01:04,562 --> 01:01:07,196
I... did you find her?
Did you arrest her?

1123
01:01:07,298 --> 01:01:08,430
Not exactly.

1124
01:01:08,532 --> 01:01:10,299
Liz said it was sara brower.

1125
01:01:10,401 --> 01:01:13,402
Sara? That's...
that's not possible.

1126
01:01:13,504 --> 01:01:15,081
We're looking for the weapon
in the lake right now.

1127
01:01:15,105 --> 01:01:17,673
Only thing we know for
sure is ballistics.

1128
01:01:17,775 --> 01:01:21,643
The bullet was a 9mm
from a smith and wesson.

1129
01:01:21,745 --> 01:01:24,746
Oh my god.

1130
01:01:24,849 --> 01:01:27,416
That's my gun.

1131
01:01:43,868 --> 01:01:46,869
(doorbell ringing,
thudding on door)

1132
01:01:48,339 --> 01:01:49,339
oh my god.

1133
01:01:49,373 --> 01:01:50,672
What is going on?

1134
01:01:50,774 --> 01:01:51,974
Sara brower?

1135
01:01:52,076 --> 01:01:53,108
Yes.

1136
01:01:53,210 --> 01:01:54,376
Liz golyar has been shot.

1137
01:01:54,478 --> 01:01:56,011
What? Who?

1138
01:01:56,113 --> 01:01:58,146
She says you did it.

1139
01:01:58,249 --> 01:02:01,083
That's insane. I've been at
home with my kids all night.

1140
01:02:01,185 --> 01:02:04,853
We need to ask you a few
questions down at the station.

1141
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:11,638
Miller: Is your
name sara brower?

1142
01:02:11,662 --> 01:02:13,562
Yes.

1143
01:02:13,664 --> 01:02:15,330
Do you know liz golyar?

1144
01:02:15,432 --> 01:02:16,698
No.

1145
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:18,445
Were you upset about
her romantic involvement

1146
01:02:18,469 --> 01:02:19,701
with dave kroupa?

1147
01:02:19,803 --> 01:02:21,336
No.

1148
01:02:21,438 --> 01:02:23,678
Miller: Were you at big
lake park this evening?

1149
01:02:23,741 --> 01:02:25,073
No.

1150
01:02:25,175 --> 01:02:26,920
Adams: Were you any place
other than your home tonight

1151
01:02:26,944 --> 01:02:28,110
after eight p.M.?

1152
01:02:28,212 --> 01:02:29,945
No!

1153
01:02:31,649 --> 01:02:33,682
I didn't shoot liz!

1154
01:02:42,526 --> 01:02:44,693
I'm so glad you're okay.

1155
01:02:44,795 --> 01:02:46,072
The surgeon said
it was a miracle

1156
01:02:46,096 --> 01:02:47,540
the bullet didn't
hit a major artery.

1157
01:02:47,564 --> 01:02:51,633
My kids, can you call them?

1158
01:02:51,735 --> 01:02:53,346
No, they're fine.
They're with their dad.

1159
01:02:53,370 --> 01:02:56,104
God...

1160
01:02:57,441 --> 01:02:59,308
Look, I'm... I'm so sorry.

1161
01:02:59,410 --> 01:03:01,488
If we hadn't been fighting,
then you wouldn't have left,

1162
01:03:01,512 --> 01:03:02,878
and this wouldn't happen.

1163
01:03:02,980 --> 01:03:04,880
That's okay.

1164
01:03:08,819 --> 01:03:10,619
Sorry to disturb you both.

1165
01:03:10,721 --> 01:03:13,121
That's okay. I'm gonna go
get her another blanket.

1166
01:03:15,759 --> 01:03:18,427
It's good to see you awake,
liz. How you feeling?

1167
01:03:18,529 --> 01:03:21,363
(scoffing) how do you think?

1168
01:03:21,465 --> 01:03:23,505
Well, we'll take an
official statement

1169
01:03:23,567 --> 01:03:24,807
when you're feeling up to it.

1170
01:03:24,868 --> 01:03:27,035
For now, forensics
will grab some prints

1171
01:03:27,137 --> 01:03:29,015
and we'll let you
get back to sleep.

1172
01:03:29,039 --> 01:03:31,406
Prints? Like fingerprints?

1173
01:03:31,508 --> 01:03:33,809
It's standard procedure,

1174
01:03:33,911 --> 01:03:35,644
for elimination purposes.

1175
01:03:35,746 --> 01:03:37,079
So, we know which prints

1176
01:03:37,181 --> 01:03:39,159
from the crime scene
are not the criminal's.

1177
01:03:39,183 --> 01:03:41,550
Oh, okay. Okay.

1178
01:03:43,354 --> 01:03:45,187
What about sara?

1179
01:03:45,289 --> 01:03:47,089
We have her prints already.

1180
01:03:47,191 --> 01:03:48,924
But are you arresting her?

1181
01:03:49,026 --> 01:03:51,360
Unfortunately, we
can't detain her.

1182
01:03:51,462 --> 01:03:54,930
Why? The woman
tried to kill me.

1183
01:03:55,032 --> 01:03:57,499
Well, without the
gun or a confession,

1184
01:03:57,601 --> 01:04:00,535
we don't have enough evidence
to arrest her just yet.

1185
01:04:02,139 --> 01:04:04,106
Right hand, please.

1186
01:04:08,512 --> 01:04:12,447
Detective kava, you look like
you haven't slept in days.

1187
01:04:12,549 --> 01:04:14,294
Well, until someone comes
up with microsoft homicide,

1188
01:04:14,318 --> 01:04:16,763
it's nothing but endless hours
looking through digital files.

1189
01:04:16,787 --> 01:04:19,388
Anything interesting yet?

1190
01:04:19,490 --> 01:04:21,768
Liz deleted her call history,
her texts, her photos,

1191
01:04:21,792 --> 01:04:24,426
but it's all still
there in the software.

1192
01:04:24,528 --> 01:04:26,661
There is one thing, though.

1193
01:04:26,764 --> 01:04:28,530
We're listening.

1194
01:04:28,632 --> 01:04:30,844
You said liz and cari don't
know each other, right?

1195
01:04:30,868 --> 01:04:32,067
According to her and dave,

1196
01:04:32,169 --> 01:04:33,279
they only crossed paths
for a few seconds,

1197
01:04:33,303 --> 01:04:34,636
didn't even speak.

1198
01:04:34,738 --> 01:04:37,406
Which is why it doesn't make
sense that liz called cari

1199
01:04:37,508 --> 01:04:39,674
six times before
she disappeared.

1200
01:04:52,122 --> 01:04:53,433
Let me get you another pillows.

1201
01:04:53,457 --> 01:04:56,024
Oh, and a glass of water?

1202
01:04:56,126 --> 01:04:57,492
Yeah, of course.

1203
01:04:57,594 --> 01:04:59,327
All right, there you go.

1204
01:04:59,430 --> 01:05:01,229
(sighing)

1205
01:05:01,331 --> 01:05:04,633
hey, I was thinking, maybe
I'll microwave some popcorn,

1206
01:05:04,735 --> 01:05:06,735
and then we can watch

1207
01:05:06,837 --> 01:05:08,782
one of those '90s
rom-coms you love so much.

1208
01:05:08,806 --> 01:05:11,339
Wow, you really do feel guilty.

1209
01:05:14,812 --> 01:05:19,081
Hey. Thanks for
taking care of me.

1210
01:05:19,183 --> 01:05:21,183
Of course.

1211
01:05:21,285 --> 01:05:23,652
I mean, after everything
you've been through,

1212
01:05:23,754 --> 01:05:27,689
the least I can do is
help you convalesce.

1213
01:05:31,161 --> 01:05:34,129
So, in my initial download
of liz's thousands of texts,

1214
01:05:34,231 --> 01:05:36,331
calls, emails, photographs,

1215
01:05:36,433 --> 01:05:38,278
I didn't see anything
worth noting.

1216
01:05:38,302 --> 01:05:39,868
But check this out!

1217
01:05:39,970 --> 01:05:41,303
With this physical download,

1218
01:05:41,405 --> 01:05:42,982
I'm getting all
of her wiped data.

1219
01:05:43,006 --> 01:05:45,207
That's how you found
the calls to cari.

1220
01:05:45,309 --> 01:05:46,775
Exactly! And also this...

1221
01:05:46,877 --> 01:05:48,410
It's an app called pretext.

1222
01:05:48,512 --> 01:05:49,956
Now, I didn't think
anything of it.

1223
01:05:49,980 --> 01:05:51,179
It's just a texting app.

1224
01:05:51,281 --> 01:05:52,859
Why wouldn't she
just text normally?

1225
01:05:52,883 --> 01:05:53,949
Great question.

1226
01:05:54,051 --> 01:05:56,718
This app allows the user
to pre-schedule a text

1227
01:05:56,820 --> 01:05:58,453
and make it look like that text

1228
01:05:58,555 --> 01:06:00,515
is coming from a
different number.

1229
01:06:01,859 --> 01:06:03,570
So, what you're saying
is that liz could

1230
01:06:03,594 --> 01:06:05,434
use this app to text somebody

1231
01:06:05,462 --> 01:06:07,440
and make it look like
it came from cari.

1232
01:06:07,464 --> 01:06:08,942
Bingo. And she could
even preschedule a text

1233
01:06:08,966 --> 01:06:10,610
and make it look like
it's coming from cari.

1234
01:06:10,634 --> 01:06:12,679
So, not only could you have
"cari" text dave, but...

1235
01:06:12,703 --> 01:06:14,147
But she could text
herself herself

1236
01:06:14,171 --> 01:06:15,915
to make it look like she's
also getting stalked.

1237
01:06:15,939 --> 01:06:17,684
When, in fact, she's
the actual stalker.

1238
01:06:17,708 --> 01:06:19,519
Kava, you brilliant
son-of-a-bitch!

1239
01:06:19,543 --> 01:06:22,444
Keep going, see what else
you can find. We'll be back.

1240
01:06:22,546 --> 01:06:25,881
Christine, we have a
breakthrough in the farver case.

1241
01:06:25,983 --> 01:06:27,349
Whoa. What can I do?

1242
01:06:27,451 --> 01:06:28,862
Pull up the print we
found in cari's car

1243
01:06:28,886 --> 01:06:30,563
and run it against
liz golyar's prints -

1244
01:06:30,587 --> 01:06:31,865
the ones you took
at the hospital.

1245
01:06:31,889 --> 01:06:34,022
Okay, just give me a second.

1246
01:06:47,404 --> 01:06:49,404
It's a match.

1247
01:06:51,475 --> 01:06:52,607
Dave: Here you go.

1248
01:06:52,709 --> 01:06:53,942
Thanks, babe.

1249
01:06:54,044 --> 01:06:57,379
- Yeah. No problem.
- (phone vibrating)

1250
01:06:57,481 --> 01:06:58,780
hello.

1251
01:06:58,882 --> 01:07:00,126
Adams: Dave. Detective adams.

1252
01:07:00,150 --> 01:07:01,249
Dave: Yeah, hey.

1253
01:07:01,351 --> 01:07:02,762
Adams: I wanted
to let you know

1254
01:07:02,786 --> 01:07:05,064
that sara's neighbor saw her
the night of the shooting,

1255
01:07:05,088 --> 01:07:06,388
so she's been cleared.

1256
01:07:06,490 --> 01:07:07,889
That's great.

1257
01:07:07,991 --> 01:07:09,302
Adams: But there's
something else.

1258
01:07:09,326 --> 01:07:10,825
Are you alone?

1259
01:07:10,928 --> 01:07:12,327
Uh, no. I'm with liz.

1260
01:07:12,429 --> 01:07:14,696
Adams: Can you
meet us somewhere?

1261
01:07:14,798 --> 01:07:16,164
By yourself.

1262
01:07:16,266 --> 01:07:17,766
Okay, sure. Why?

1263
01:07:17,868 --> 01:07:21,503
Adams: Because she
may be dangerous.

1264
01:07:21,605 --> 01:07:24,039
Who is it?

1265
01:07:26,143 --> 01:07:28,310
Uh, it's, um, nick.

1266
01:07:28,412 --> 01:07:29,744
Tell him I said, "what's up?"

1267
01:07:29,846 --> 01:07:32,581
okay, yeah. Uh, hello?

1268
01:07:32,683 --> 01:07:35,283
Adams: I don't know
how to tell you this.

1269
01:07:35,385 --> 01:07:39,387
We have evidence that
points to liz golyar.

1270
01:07:39,489 --> 01:07:41,923
Dave, she's your stalker.

1271
01:07:50,167 --> 01:07:51,499
Dave: No, no.

1272
01:07:51,602 --> 01:07:53,468
I was... I was with liz

1273
01:07:53,570 --> 01:07:55,181
when we both got
texts our phones.

1274
01:07:55,205 --> 01:07:56,282
She couldn't have
texted herself.

1275
01:07:56,306 --> 01:07:57,386
We have digital proof

1276
01:07:57,474 --> 01:07:59,519
that liz was impersonating
cari with an app.

1277
01:07:59,543 --> 01:08:01,243
Okay, so, she shot herself?

1278
01:08:01,345 --> 01:08:04,012
She burned down her house? Her
two dogs were in that house.

1279
01:08:04,114 --> 01:08:07,949
Unfortunately, yes, it looks
like she did all those things.

1280
01:08:11,722 --> 01:08:14,256
You're s...

1281
01:08:14,358 --> 01:08:17,325
Oh my...

1282
01:08:17,427 --> 01:08:20,595
I... Oh my god.

1283
01:08:22,432 --> 01:08:23,898
Oh my god.

1284
01:08:24,001 --> 01:08:27,402
I know, I know. She
had us fooled, too.

1285
01:08:28,705 --> 01:08:31,072
So, it wasn't cari.

1286
01:08:31,174 --> 01:08:32,941
We think cari is dead.

1287
01:08:41,385 --> 01:08:44,519
This whole time, I thought...

1288
01:08:44,621 --> 01:08:47,455
But you're telling me
that you think liz...

1289
01:08:47,557 --> 01:08:50,025
Was involved in
cari's death, yeah.

1290
01:08:50,127 --> 01:08:53,895
But we don't have enough
evidence for a murder charge...

1291
01:08:53,997 --> 01:08:55,196
Yet.

1292
01:08:55,299 --> 01:08:58,633
There's something else.

1293
01:08:58,735 --> 01:09:00,435
You and sara may be in danger.

1294
01:09:00,537 --> 01:09:02,370
And my kids.

1295
01:09:02,472 --> 01:09:05,507
If I were you, I wouldn't
want them to be alone.

1296
01:09:11,214 --> 01:09:12,914
Thanks for coming in today.

1297
01:09:13,016 --> 01:09:15,817
Yeah, anything I can do to help.

1298
01:09:15,919 --> 01:09:17,664
Can we get you coffee
or water or...?

1299
01:09:17,688 --> 01:09:18,753
No. Thank you.

1300
01:09:18,855 --> 01:09:20,800
Well, the reason we
brought you in today

1301
01:09:20,824 --> 01:09:23,591
is because we found remains.

1302
01:09:23,694 --> 01:09:25,260
Human remains.

1303
01:09:25,362 --> 01:09:26,528
Okay.

1304
01:09:26,630 --> 01:09:28,708
We're waiting for the
lab for a positive id,

1305
01:09:28,732 --> 01:09:31,700
but we suspect it's cari farver.

1306
01:09:31,802 --> 01:09:35,236
Well, I only met
cari one time, so...

1307
01:09:35,339 --> 01:09:36,938
Yeah, uh,

1308
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:40,175
but you are one of the
victims in the stalker case...

1309
01:09:40,277 --> 01:09:41,943
Are you looking at sara brower?

1310
01:09:42,045 --> 01:09:45,013
Well, we were looking at cari.

1311
01:09:45,115 --> 01:09:46,614
But now, we're thinking,

1312
01:09:46,717 --> 01:09:49,684
if sara was so bold as
to do this with you,

1313
01:09:49,786 --> 01:09:51,731
maybe she did it
to cari, as well.

1314
01:09:51,755 --> 01:09:54,255
Sara keeps coming in
and out of dave's life,

1315
01:09:54,358 --> 01:09:58,927
so, I'm just saying, as
another person who would be...

1316
01:09:59,029 --> 01:10:02,831
Possessive of dave, it'd be her.

1317
01:10:02,933 --> 01:10:05,734
The problem is, we
don't have any evidence.

1318
01:10:05,836 --> 01:10:07,569
Okay.

1319
01:10:07,671 --> 01:10:10,505
If, for example, we
had anything of sara

1320
01:10:10,607 --> 01:10:12,685
inferring that she had
done something to cari...

1321
01:10:12,709 --> 01:10:15,810
(chuckling) ..That'd be gold.

1322
01:10:15,912 --> 01:10:18,313
We could build a
murder case with that.

1323
01:10:18,415 --> 01:10:20,515
You mean, you need
her to admit it?

1324
01:10:20,617 --> 01:10:23,451
Well, that or threatening
statements of some kind,

1325
01:10:23,553 --> 01:10:25,553
yeah.

1326
01:10:29,860 --> 01:10:31,559
Hey.

1327
01:10:31,661 --> 01:10:33,661
Hey.

1328
01:10:33,764 --> 01:10:35,230
Uh, I got you a beer.

1329
01:10:35,332 --> 01:10:37,065
Sorry I'm late.

1330
01:10:39,236 --> 01:10:42,904
So, uh... I have some news.

1331
01:10:44,408 --> 01:10:47,609
Danny's been getting into
fights at school, acting out.

1332
01:10:47,711 --> 01:10:49,778
Oh no.

1333
01:10:49,880 --> 01:10:52,247
Yeah. I guess he punched a
girl at the water fountain.

1334
01:10:52,349 --> 01:10:53,349
What?

1335
01:10:53,383 --> 01:10:54,716
So, anyway,

1336
01:10:54,818 --> 01:10:56,418
we talked to his teacher

1337
01:10:56,520 --> 01:10:59,687
and she thinks it's best if I'm
maybe around a little bit more.

1338
01:11:00,824 --> 01:11:03,058
But you're around all the time.

1339
01:11:03,160 --> 01:11:04,459
I know. I know.

1340
01:11:04,561 --> 01:11:08,196
And I know you'll understand,
as a parent, that,

1341
01:11:08,298 --> 01:11:11,266
obviously, kids come first.

1342
01:11:11,368 --> 01:11:13,234
So, uh...

1343
01:11:13,336 --> 01:11:16,104
I'm gonna have to move back
into the house with sara

1344
01:11:16,206 --> 01:11:18,306
and the kids for a little bit.

1345
01:11:22,379 --> 01:11:24,546
Is this some kind of sick joke?

1346
01:11:24,648 --> 01:11:28,016
No, no, I just, you
know, danny's...

1347
01:11:28,118 --> 01:11:31,753
What the hell? Dave, are
you kidding me right now?

1348
01:11:31,855 --> 01:11:33,566
You're telling me you're
gonna move back in

1349
01:11:33,590 --> 01:11:35,757
with a woman who
tried to kill me?

1350
01:11:35,859 --> 01:11:37,892
She shot me, dave.

1351
01:11:37,994 --> 01:11:40,595
Dave: I mean, that's still
under investigation. It might...

1352
01:11:40,697 --> 01:11:42,275
Oh, wait, wait, wait.
So, you're telling me

1353
01:11:42,299 --> 01:11:43,598
you don't believe me now?

1354
01:11:43,700 --> 01:11:45,878
Is that what you're saying?
We're back to that again?

1355
01:11:45,902 --> 01:11:47,346
You don't... You
don't believe me?

1356
01:11:47,370 --> 01:11:48,570
No, I completely trust you.

1357
01:11:48,672 --> 01:11:49,749
You are a son-of-a bitch, dave.

1358
01:11:49,773 --> 01:11:52,474
You're the one that asked me

1359
01:11:52,576 --> 01:11:54,042
to move in with you.

1360
01:11:54,144 --> 01:11:55,788
No. I just said
that you could...

1361
01:11:55,812 --> 01:11:57,890
I said that you could stay
with me as long as you needed.

1362
01:11:57,914 --> 01:12:00,114
But then, all this stuff
with danny happened...

1363
01:12:00,183 --> 01:12:01,727
No, that's not what you said!
That is not what you said!

1364
01:12:01,751 --> 01:12:03,818
Go to hell, dave!

1365
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:06,287
Go to hell!

1366
01:12:14,131 --> 01:12:15,797
About time.

1367
01:12:15,899 --> 01:12:17,432
Bad news is there was traffic.

1368
01:12:17,534 --> 01:12:20,034
Good news is there's a
triple shot in there.

1369
01:12:20,137 --> 01:12:21,202
You're forgiven.

1370
01:12:21,304 --> 01:12:23,104
Anything?

1371
01:12:23,206 --> 01:12:24,639
Well, she didn't waste time.

1372
01:12:24,741 --> 01:12:27,053
Came in this morning and this
was waiting in my in-box.

1373
01:12:27,077 --> 01:12:31,312
Liz forwarded it over and,
apparently, it's from sara.

1374
01:12:32,983 --> 01:12:34,616
"when I met crazy cari,

1375
01:12:34,718 --> 01:12:38,153
"she would not stop talking
about dave being her husband.

1376
01:12:38,255 --> 01:12:39,654
"she tried to attack me,

1377
01:12:39,756 --> 01:12:41,667
"but I stabbed her
three to four times

1378
01:12:41,691 --> 01:12:43,391
"in the chest and stomach area.

1379
01:12:43,493 --> 01:12:45,404
"I, then, took her
out and burned her.

1380
01:12:45,428 --> 01:12:49,164
"I stuffed her body in a
garbage can with crap."

1381
01:12:49,266 --> 01:12:51,633
wow.

1382
01:12:51,735 --> 01:12:54,369
Very first email is a
straight-up murder confession.

1383
01:12:54,471 --> 01:12:55,870
She knows that's what we need.

1384
01:12:55,972 --> 01:12:59,407
Well, we know what
the murder weapon is

1385
01:12:59,509 --> 01:13:01,509
now, all we need is a body.

1386
01:13:12,989 --> 01:13:16,457
So, where do you want
me to put my stuff?

1387
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:18,193
I don't like this, dave.

1388
01:13:18,295 --> 01:13:19,961
Look, it's not forever.

1389
01:13:20,063 --> 01:13:21,963
No, I mean...

1390
01:13:22,065 --> 01:13:25,266
How dangerous do
they think she is?

1391
01:13:25,368 --> 01:13:27,448
I just want you and
the kids to be safe.

1392

(phone ringing)

1393
01:13:46,389 --> 01:13:47,755
this is detective adams.

1394
01:13:47,857 --> 01:13:51,426
Looks like the only person
that benefitted was sara

1395
01:13:51,528 --> 01:13:54,529
because she gets
to shoot somebody,

1396
01:13:54,631 --> 01:13:58,399
and she gets to
kill another person,

1397
01:13:58,501 --> 01:14:00,735
and she gets to live with dave,

1398
01:14:00,837 --> 01:14:03,638
and she gets to be free,

1399
01:14:03,740 --> 01:14:06,274
and you guys aren't
arresting her.

1400
01:14:07,510 --> 01:14:09,255
Well, we know this
must be hard on you,

1401
01:14:09,279 --> 01:14:10,612
but we need more evidence

1402
01:14:10,714 --> 01:14:13,214
in order to make a
murder charge stick.

1403
01:14:13,316 --> 01:14:14,816
We're building a case.

1404
01:14:14,918 --> 01:14:17,452
We don't want to move forward
unless it's rock solid.

1405
01:14:17,554 --> 01:14:19,532
Liz: I don't understand.
What more do you need?

1406
01:14:19,556 --> 01:14:22,123
She confessed!

1407
01:14:22,225 --> 01:14:23,725
We need details,

1408
01:14:23,827 --> 01:14:25,867
things that only the
killer would know.

1409
01:14:28,431 --> 01:14:31,199

Yup. "from sara."

01:15:59,856 --> 01:16:01,723
I think so.

1425
01:16:03,727 --> 01:16:06,027
Thank you.

1426
01:16:06,129 --> 01:16:09,197
Um...

1427
01:16:09,299 --> 01:16:11,899
A few days ago, I had a dream.

1428
01:16:12,001 --> 01:16:14,469
It was very vivid.

1429
01:16:14,571 --> 01:16:17,438
Cari's dad came to me,

1430
01:16:17,540 --> 01:16:20,441
and he told me not to
worry about carrie anymore

1431
01:16:20,543 --> 01:16:23,111
because she was with him.

1432
01:16:25,448 --> 01:16:27,615
She's gone.

1433
01:16:27,717 --> 01:16:31,252
I know.

1434
01:16:31,354 --> 01:16:34,322
I just... I don't know
how to tell her son

1435
01:16:34,424 --> 01:16:37,725
that... His mom's dead.

1436
01:16:40,063 --> 01:16:42,864
(sobbing) how do I do that?

1437
01:16:42,966 --> 01:16:46,267
How do I tell him? (sobbing)

1438
01:16:46,369 --> 01:16:49,771
(sobbing)

1439
01:17:00,850 --> 01:17:01,894
who wants orange juice?

1440
01:17:01,918 --> 01:17:03,351
I do!

1441
01:17:03,453 --> 01:17:05,973
Okay, sweetie, grab yourself a
glass and I'll pour it for you.

1442
01:17:08,591 --> 01:17:11,225
Oh my god!

1443
01:17:11,327 --> 01:17:12,894
Mommy!

1444
01:17:12,996 --> 01:17:14,962
- What happened?
- Danny: Daddy!

1445
01:17:15,064 --> 01:17:18,733
You okay? You all
right? All right.

1446
01:17:18,835 --> 01:17:20,334
(emily sobbing)

1447
01:17:20,437 --> 01:17:24,539
I'm calling the
cops. All right.

1448
01:17:24,641 --> 01:17:27,275
I think it's gonna be
a really fun weekend.

1449
01:17:27,377 --> 01:17:29,410

- Yeah.

1450

Things are going

1454
01:18:15,091 --> 01:18:17,825
blood in the vehicle's a
match to cari farver's dna.

1455
01:18:17,927 --> 01:18:19,327
How's the search going?

1456
01:18:19,429 --> 01:18:22,330
Well, we found multiple
phones, a camera, a tablet,

1457
01:18:22,432 --> 01:18:23,297
all at liz's house.

1458
01:18:23,399 --> 01:18:24,932
Kava's gonna have a field day.

1459
01:18:25,034 --> 01:18:26,334
Where's liz?

1460
01:18:26,436 --> 01:18:27,535
In processing.

1461
01:18:27,637 --> 01:18:28,848
They won't be able to
hold her long, though.

1462
01:18:28,872 --> 01:18:30,771
I think we've got enough.

1463
01:18:30,874 --> 01:18:32,573
You ready to do this?

1464
01:18:36,546 --> 01:18:39,480
(chattering on police radio)

1465
01:18:39,582 --> 01:18:41,115
why am I here?

1466
01:18:41,217 --> 01:18:43,251
I got to pick up my kids soon.

1467
01:18:43,353 --> 01:18:44,752
We need to ask you

1468
01:18:44,854 --> 01:18:47,955
some questions about a few
items we found in your house.

1469
01:18:48,057 --> 01:18:49,557
In my house?

1470
01:18:49,659 --> 01:18:51,225
Yes. We got a warrant.

1471
01:18:51,327 --> 01:18:53,928
Why? Because you
think I threw a rock?

1472
01:18:54,030 --> 01:18:55,563
We found a bunch of electronics

1473
01:18:55,665 --> 01:18:58,299
we believe belonged
to cari farver.

1474
01:18:59,536 --> 01:19:01,280
My kids have tons
of electronics,

1475
01:19:01,304 --> 01:19:03,482
and their friends are always
bringing over devices.

1476
01:19:03,506 --> 01:19:06,440
You probably found one of
their ipads or whatever.

1477
01:19:06,543 --> 01:19:08,042
These belonged to cari farver.

1478
01:19:08,144 --> 01:19:10,177
Cari's never been to my house.

1479
01:19:10,280 --> 01:19:12,320
I don't know cari.
I met her one time.

1480
01:19:12,415 --> 01:19:14,760
We also found evidence that
shows you've been sending emails

1481
01:19:14,784 --> 01:19:15,864
using cari's account.

1482
01:19:15,952 --> 01:19:17,685
No, I didn't.

1483
01:19:18,988 --> 01:19:22,223
Did you load an app on
your phone called pretext?

1484
01:19:22,325 --> 01:19:23,925
No, I didn't.

1485
01:19:24,027 --> 01:19:25,471
Because that's what you've
been using to text dave

1486
01:19:25,495 --> 01:19:26,672
and yourself, posing as cari.

1487
01:19:26,696 --> 01:19:28,162
No, I didn't.

1488
01:19:28,264 --> 01:19:30,009
We have the digital
evidence, liz.

1489
01:19:30,033 --> 01:19:33,167
And we know the emails you
forwarded to us from sara

1490
01:19:33,269 --> 01:19:34,835
were actually created by you.

1491
01:19:34,938 --> 01:19:37,238
- I haven't created any emails.
- Keep in mind,

1492
01:19:37,340 --> 01:19:39,285
lying to a government
official is also a crime.

1493
01:19:39,309 --> 01:19:41,520
I don't... I don't know
what to tell you. I-I'm...

1494
01:19:41,544 --> 01:19:43,377
Someone shot me.

1495
01:19:43,479 --> 01:19:46,180
Someone burned down my house.

1496
01:19:46,282 --> 01:19:47,615
Well, you set the fire.

1497
01:19:47,717 --> 01:19:51,018
Investigators found candles
beside the electric heater

1498
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:52,765
and the accelerant
on the back deck.

1499
01:19:52,789 --> 01:19:56,591
Plenty of time for you to leave
the house before it ignited.

1500

I'm not gonna be accused
of something I didn't do!

1501

You're not going
to admit to this?

1502
01:20:00,063 --> 01:20:01,095
I'm done talking,

1503
01:20:01,197 --> 01:20:02,775
and I'm going to
have my attorney

1504
01:20:02,799 --> 01:20:04,865

Adams: We have confirmation
that this foot is decomposing

1506
01:20:11,874 --> 01:20:14,675

This is her foot.

1509

The photo was found in the
deleted data of your cell phone.

Your fingerprint matches a print

1511

We could go on and on.
