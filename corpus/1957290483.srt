1
00:00:40,915 --> 00:00:45,295
I moved my family
to western New York for land.

2
00:00:47,088 --> 00:00:49,924
Like my father
and his father before him,

3
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:53,762
I want to grow old
with my family around me.

4
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:58,725
With my sons working the land
by my side, in peace.

5
00:01:00,685 --> 00:01:05,105
The fire of religion has gotten hot,
competing for every new convert.

6
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:06,983
That's false doctrine, Reverend.

7
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:10,361
We're holding orthodox meetings
in my home!

8
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:18,286
And then, Joseph Smith came
into our lives.

9
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:27,462
A farm boy who claimed he talked
with God and saw angels.

10
00:01:30,632 --> 00:01:32,258
He printed a new book of scripture

11
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:35,053
he said he'd translated
from golden plates.

12
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:39,057
He founded a church.

13
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:43,061
I don't know how Joseph has done this,
but it's evil and I want no part of it.

14
00:01:43,144 --> 00:01:46,648
What right do you have to tell us
what we will or won't believe?

15
00:01:47,148 --> 00:01:49,359
And it's tearing my family apart.

16
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:56,157
I've already lost one son.
My boy, Joshua.

17
00:01:57,075 --> 00:01:58,827
He hates the Mormons

18
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:00,787
and hates his brother, Nathan,

19
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:02,413
You've shamed the family enough.

20
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:04,582
For stealing his girl, Lydia.

21
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:08,002
Joshua, no!

22
00:02:08,127 --> 00:02:10,588
He's cleared out
for the Missouri frontier

23
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:12,382
where a lot of lost souls congregate.

24
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:13,550
Joshua?

25
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,391
But maybe weâ€™ll have
a little peace today,

26
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:23,017
for this is a happy day.

27
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:06,603
Brothers and sisters,
it's a good day for a new beginning.

28
00:03:07,645 --> 00:03:12,567
I'm honored to perform the marriage
of Nathan Steed and Lydia McBride.

29
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:14,527
Smith, stop this wedding now!

30
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:30,627
That man, sir, has no legal right
to perform any wedding of any kind.

31
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:33,546
I request that you put a stop
to it immediately.

32
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:37,175
- Papa.
- I'm sorry, Lydia, but I warned you.

33
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:39,719
Mr. Smith,
how do you answer these charges?

34
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:41,137
I deny them.

35
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:43,973
Our church was legally organized
as of a week ago.

36
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:45,266
That's a lie!

37
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,518
And I'm an ordained minister
in that church.

38
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:50,563
You have witnesses
to the organization of this church?

39
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:56,903
That's enough, Mr. McBride.

40
00:03:57,278 --> 00:03:58,738
Look, Mr. Steed,

41
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:01,366
I know you don't want this wedding
any more than I do.

42
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:03,493
- Now...
- That has nothing to do with it.

43
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:07,455
Sir, Mr. McBride has come
onto my property uninvited.

44
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:10,541
I believe you call that trespassing.

45
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:14,671
And if he doesn't leave quickly,
I will be forced to press charges.

46
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:17,589
This is absurd, Mr. Steed,
and you know it.

47
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:20,927
- This man is a deceiver!
- Let's go, McBride.

48
00:04:25,264 --> 00:04:26,808
Goodbye, Lydia.

49
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:36,192
I think we can continue now.

50
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:39,028
Thank you, Pa.

51
00:04:42,281 --> 00:04:43,950
Look at me, both of you.

52
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,957
What God joins together,
let no man put asunder.

53
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:56,629
Nathan Steed, my old friend,

54
00:04:58,214 --> 00:05:00,258
and Lydia McBride, my new friend,

55
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:05,221
do you covenant to be
each other's companions through life,

56
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:08,391
to care for, to cherish

57
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:11,519
and to give one another
all that you have and are

58
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:13,896
till the end of your days?

59
00:05:14,313 --> 00:05:15,857
Yes, Joseph.

60
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:18,109
I do.

61
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:20,569
Good.

62
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:25,116
Then by the power that is indeed
granted me by the state of New York,

63
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:30,580
and by the authority given by
the God of Heaven and Earth,

64
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:35,209
I pronounce you husband and wife
for as long as you both shall live.

65
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:45,303
And in the spirit of prophecy, I tell you,

66
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:49,390
this union will one day heal this family.

67
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:52,602
And it won't be here in Palmyra,
but in Zion.

68
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:59,484
Now Nathan, will you kiss her
before someone else comes

69
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:01,235
and tries to interrupt this marriage?

70
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:23,734
Joshua.

71
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:33,202
I just...
just want to wish you all the best.

72
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:41,419
Son?

73
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:46,507
- Pa.
- You stay away from her.

74
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:50,261
Pa, that's not why I'm here.

75
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:55,057
You stay away from her and this family.
You're no longer welcome here.

76
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:04,150
- That's a real fine "How do you do," Pa.
- It's not a gun in your face.

77
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:16,078
Come on! Come on.

78
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,210
You all right?

79
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:25,963
Yes.

80
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:37,265
We thank you, Lord,
for Nathan and Lydia's new life together.

81
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,519
- Ow!
- Matthew.

82
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:40,852
Bless them.

83
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:43,940
And Lord, bless Joshua.

84
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:46,067
Thirty-five acres in sweet corn...

85
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,610
We miss him.

86
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:51,405
Five acres near the river in squash,
tomatoes and beets.

87
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:53,115
Watch over him and if you can...

88
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:54,575
Forty acres in wheat.

89
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,369
Bring him back home to us.

90
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:58,746
Twenty apple trees.

91
00:08:58,829 --> 00:09:03,709
For all our abundant blessings,
we thank you. In Jesus' name, Amen.

92
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:05,503
- Joshua.
- Amen.

93
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:47,503
Jessie!

94
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:52,883
Jessie!

95
00:10:04,603 --> 00:10:07,523
- What's wrong?
- Marry me.

96
00:10:13,487 --> 00:10:14,572
Jess,

97
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:19,493
- marry me.
- Fine.

98
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:26,917
And so by the power vested in me
by the great state of Missouri,

99
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:29,545
I pronounce you man and wife.

100
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:34,884
Congratulations. I wish you
all the happiness, I really do.

101
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:40,806
- Thanks, Bobby.
- Goodnight. Mrs. Steed, Mr. Steed.

102
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:51,233
I got this.

103
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,703
Jess, I'm gonna take you out
of this place. Out of this saloon.

104
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:05,539
You won't ever have to come back here
unless you want to.

105
00:11:05,664 --> 00:11:06,749
Promise me?

106
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:10,628
- All right.
- Promise me.

107
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:16,967
Jess, all this,
this will be like it never happened.

108
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:29,814
- Oh, hello. My goodness.
- We saw the candle in the window.

109
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:32,692
Come, sit. You must be freezing.

110
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:36,195
- Hello.
- Hello, this is a nice surprise. Nathan.

111
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:38,878
- Are we interrupting your work?
- No, no, don't worry about that.

112
00:11:38,989 --> 00:11:41,992
He's preparing the revelations
to publish them.

113
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:44,036
The ones we've written down anyway.

114
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:46,455
Sit down, sit down.
Make yourselves comfortable.

115
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:52,211
What can we do for the Steeds?

116
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:57,967
Joseph, you remember at our wedding,

117
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:00,553
you told us something.

118
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,973
I believe I told you to kiss the girl.

119
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:07,309
Yes. Just before that...

120
00:12:09,186 --> 00:12:11,772
You said we weren't gonna stay
in Palmyra.

121
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:16,360
Where's Zion?

122
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,618
I can tell you something more.

123
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:34,587
Joseph Smith, we have
a warrant for your arrest.

124
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:37,590
What are the charges this time, Frank?

125
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:41,177
Claiming to have visions,
setting the neighborhood in an uproar.

126
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:44,138
I don't write them, Joseph.
I just carry them out.

127
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:45,306
You'll come with me.

128
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:47,391
- What are these?
- That's none of your affair.

129
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:48,475
Nathan!

130
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:55,024
I've got to admit that I'm surprised
you jumped in there like that, Nathan.

131
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:59,737
Something I'd expect Joshua to do,
or maybe your pa, but not you.

132
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:08,537
- Where's Frank?
- Frank's out.

133
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:14,793
- How you doing, Joe?
- Joseph!

134
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:18,631
All right, prophet man,
why don't you prophesy for us?

135
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:22,384
- Joseph!
- Who hit you?

136
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:25,429
Who hit you?

137
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:28,265
- Frank!
- First you tell us who hit you.

138
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:32,645
Frank's coming back.

139
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:49,370
Joseph, are you all right?

140
00:13:53,832 --> 00:13:55,543
Yes, I'm all right.

141
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:02,258
Why won't people just leave us alone?

142
00:14:09,848 --> 00:14:11,600
You asked me what I meant

143
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:15,688
when I said that you wouldn't
be staying in Palmyra.

144
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:19,900
We're leaving this place.

145
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:23,988
The Lord is calling his people to Ohio.

146
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:30,244
- Ls that where Zion is?
- Zion is more than a place, Nathan.

147
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:34,415
To St. Louis for him. Give him a deal
if he's ready by tomorrow night.

148
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:37,585
New York, I know.
But this will get him as far as St. Louis.

149
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:39,062
He should be interested in half-price.

150
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:42,298
We are here on a mission
to speak to you.

151
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:45,843
And Wilson Everett's waiting for you.
He says to tell you he wants to collect

152
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:49,179
on what we owe him for those wagons,
which puts us in an awkward situation.

153
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:51,724
- Ls he smiling?
- Sure, he's smiling.

154
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:53,559
Then I know what he wants.

155
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:05,904
Wilson Everett. Something tells me
this isn't a friendly visit.

156
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:08,157
Can't a man just stop by anymore?

157
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:13,037
So, here it is.
I'm good for it, you know that.

158
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,039
But seeing as how
I didn't know you were coming,

159
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:17,100
we can settle things over
a friendly game of poker

160
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:18,834
down at Roundy's tonight.

161
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:23,464
I think that sounds like a fine idea.

162
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:36,810
Bought a new dress today.

163
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:44,151
- You like it?
- Yeah, I like it. Why wouldn't I?

164
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:47,154
Hey, did you see my watch,
my new one?

165
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:48,906
Downstairs on the table.

166
00:15:50,407 --> 00:15:51,825
You ever heard of the Mormons?

167
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:55,204
Yeah, why?

168
00:15:56,580 --> 00:16:00,000
No reason. Just saw some of them
in town today, is all.

169
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,003
In lndependence?

170
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:06,423
- Joshua, you up there?
- Yeah, I'm coming, Bobby.

171
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:08,717
Stay away from the Mormons.

172
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,760
Joshua.

173
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:14,348
I got something to tell you.

174
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:16,892
What, Jessie?

175
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:21,939
Nothing. I'll tell you later.

176
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:41,083
Get back here!

177
00:16:58,308 --> 00:17:01,103
- Thank you, Everett.
- See you again.

178
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:03,647
- You the Mormons?
- Yes, sir.

179
00:17:04,147 --> 00:17:06,692
Parley Pratt's the name. And you are?

180
00:17:07,608 --> 00:17:09,319
Stay away from my wife.

181
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:16,993
Joshua Steed.

182
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:27,045
- It's a peaceful place, isn't it?
- Lt is.

183
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:30,883
Do you know yet
where we'll stay tonight?

184
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:33,469
Not yet.

185
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:39,641
I'm sorry, Sister Smith,
but I'm sure the Lord will provide for us.

186
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:43,395
I've heard the Lord provides
for those who provide for themselves.

187
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:45,773
I'm sure I've heard that somewhere.

188
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:47,983
I believe that.

189
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,249
Anything else, Carl?

190
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:17,096
- This is it.
- The mercantile?

191
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:23,602
Newell K. Whitney, thou art the man.

192
00:18:25,145 --> 00:18:27,564
I'm afraid you have
the advantage of me, sir.

193
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:31,318
I'm Joseph, the prophet.
You've prayed me here.

194
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:33,237
Now what do you want of me?

195
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:36,532
- Joseph Smith?
- The same.

196
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:43,038
Joseph Smith. Welcome to Kirtland.
Have you a place to stay?

197
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,334
Welcome to Ohio, Sister Smith.

198
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:56,134
First group should be leaving Palmyra
within a week or so.

199
00:18:57,386 --> 00:19:00,639
I'm surprised people were able
to sell their farms so quickly.

200
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:05,060
Some of them made it all right,

201
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:11,984
but some, I guess, are selling short
or walking away.

202
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:15,696
And why would they just walk away?

203
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:29,835
Because the Lord asked them to.

204
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,548
Because I did.

205
00:19:35,048 --> 00:19:39,303
Yes, but you did not ask them
to just up and leave everything.

206
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:45,517
I told them that the Lord wanted them
in Ohio as soon as they could.

207
00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:50,230
And He does.

208
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:58,614
Some of them are coming with nothing
but the clothes on their backs.

209
00:20:00,115 --> 00:20:02,618
And where will they stay
once they get here?

210
00:20:05,078 --> 00:20:07,581
Not everyone has your faith, Joseph.

211
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:13,253
I don't have all the answers yet.

212
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:21,094
- But when the Lord commands, I do it.
- "I do it." Yes, I know.

213
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:25,057
At least, I try.

214
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:29,561
So they'll leave everything.

215
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:35,233
You did.

216
00:20:38,695 --> 00:20:40,030
Where's Ohio?

217
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:42,532
It's on the other side
of Pennsylvania, dummy.

218
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:45,077
- Where's Pennsylvania?
- It's between...

219
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:48,830
Matthew, that is not ready to go yet!
Put it back, please.

220
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:52,751
Excuse me, Mrs. Steed.
We're about ready to head out.

221
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:01,760
Lydia, you need to sit down.

222
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:06,223
You packed your quilts, didn't you?
The baby's gonna need them.

223
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:11,812
- I only had room for one.
- Then I'll put in a couple of mine.

224
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:14,764
That's the nice thing
about not having much, I suppose.

225
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:16,525
Easier to pack up and go.

226
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:21,905
- I want to go, Mama.
- That's enough, Melissa.

227
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:24,950
Mama, why do we have
to move to Ohio?

228
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:28,078
We're not, dear.
Just Nathan and Lydia are.

229
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:29,663
Then why are you packing my shirts?

230
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:33,375
We're just going till the baby comes,
then we're coming back.

231
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:37,504
- Why ain't Pa and Melissa coming?
- Why aren't Pa and Melissa coming?

232
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:39,965
That's a good question, Mother.

233
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:43,927
Your pa can't leave the farm
and he needs Melissa's help.

234
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:45,652
What, with the milking
of the cows and...

235
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:49,099
This isn't about milking cows, Mother!
This is about Joseph.

236
00:21:49,224 --> 00:21:50,809
Melissa, that's enough!

237
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:55,689
God speaks to Joseph Smith, Mama,
and he is asking us to follow him.

238
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:58,150
Do we just ignore that?

239
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:02,404
God also said
to honor your father and your mother.

240
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:06,908
Is that what Zion means, Mama?
Moving to Ohio?

241
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:11,580
I'm not sure, honey.

242
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,498
I want to go.

243
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:16,543
- Papa?
- No.

244
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:17,961
Why not?

245
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:20,464
Because I need help
around here, Melissa.

246
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:22,389
And contrary to what you
and Nathan may think,

247
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:24,134
I can't run this farm by myself.

248
00:22:24,217 --> 00:22:26,928
- If you'll just listen, I...
- No.

249
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:31,892
Will you at least just let me tell you
why I want to go?

250
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:34,686
- And why?
- I want to go to Zion.

251
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:37,355
And this Zion is in Ohio, is it?

252
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:41,276
You don't know
what you're talking about.

253
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:45,739
Just because you don't know what I'm
talking about doesn't mean I don't.

254
00:22:45,822 --> 00:22:47,115
What then?

255
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:50,285
What does it mean, Melissa?
Please tell me.

256
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:51,745
It's where the Saints are.

257
00:22:55,123 --> 00:22:58,835
I don't understand all of it,
but I know that it's real.

258
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,462
And, you don't know.

259
00:23:00,962 --> 00:23:03,381
And I am not going to have
my whole family running away

260
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:07,052
chasing some boy who's promising Zion
or whatever you want to call it.

261
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:10,806
No! You'll just drive them away
one by one,

262
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:13,642
with your stubborn, bullheaded ways!

263
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:17,813
No, Melissa. No. No. No.

264
00:23:19,022 --> 00:23:21,316
You're the one
who's running away, Papa.

265
00:23:23,276 --> 00:23:25,028
What are you so afraid of?

266
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:37,791
Mary Ann.

267
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:44,214
I know I don't entirely understand it,

268
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:49,177
but I can tell you what I think Zion is,
what I hope it is.

269
00:23:50,053 --> 00:23:53,223
I hope it's a place
where a family can find peace.

270
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:58,103
Where a mother can gather all
her children around her, every last one,

271
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:04,192
and not have this aching for those
who've wandered or been pushed away.

272
00:24:08,488 --> 00:24:10,323
If that's what Zion is,

273
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:15,412
then I don't know what I wouldn't do
to find it.

274
00:24:39,853 --> 00:24:41,396
Saying goodbye?

275
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:44,149
I suppose.

276
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:52,282
Are you all right?

277
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:57,412
Nathan, where will we live?

278
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,373
What's going to become of us?

279
00:25:00,498 --> 00:25:03,210
Come Thou Fount of every blessing

280
00:25:03,501 --> 00:25:08,381
Tune my heart to sing Thy grace

281
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:13,511
Streams of mercy never ceasing

282
00:25:13,803 --> 00:25:18,016
Call for songs of loudest praise

283
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:22,771
Teach me some melodious sonnet

284
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:27,692
Sung by flaming tongues above

285
00:25:27,984 --> 00:25:32,489
Praise the mount! I'm fixed upon it

286
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:37,202
Mount of Thy redeeming love

287
00:25:45,001 --> 00:25:48,713
Get back, get back, get back. Good girl.

288
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:52,550
- Good morning, Ben.
- Morning, Martin.

289
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:55,762
Consider horses for this?
I'll loan you a couple.

290
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:57,847
No, I prefer mules, thank you.

291
00:26:00,183 --> 00:26:03,645
I'm selling my farm, Ben.
Moving to Ohio.

292
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:06,147
- Kirtland?
- Yeah.

293
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:08,316
Leaving with a group
the end of this month.

294
00:26:08,441 --> 00:26:10,860
There's a lot of good land
there, too, Ben.

295
00:26:11,611 --> 00:26:13,571
That's not why you're going though,
is it?

296
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:14,864
No.

297
00:26:16,491 --> 00:26:19,869
No, there's a greater purpose here, Ben.
That's true.

298
00:26:21,955 --> 00:26:23,623
I don't know, Ben.

299
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:29,087
For a man who is aching for a change,
why not Ohio?

300
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:33,842
Why not a place where there's
a lot of good land, a lot of good people?

301
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:36,761
A place where he can be close
to his grandbabies?

302
00:26:38,346 --> 00:26:39,723
Come with me, Ben.

303
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:44,352
I'm not having my family
chasing after Joseph.

304
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:46,855
I understand Melissa
had her own ideas.

305
00:26:47,647 --> 00:26:48,898
She'll be back.

306
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:57,240
- She's stubborn.
- Oh, yeah. She's a Steed.

307
00:26:59,826 --> 00:27:01,703
I'm right about this, Martin.

308
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:05,915
You may not see it now, but I'm right.

309
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:10,211
You pull it up by the roots,
you're likely to kill the tree.

310
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:17,344
And you of all people should know that.

311
00:27:18,553 --> 00:27:20,889
All the trees
and all the land in the world, Ben,

312
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:23,099
isn't worth two bits
if the man who owns it

313
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:25,352
sits alone in an empty house.

314
00:27:25,685 --> 00:27:28,271
So, your wife's going to Ohio with you,
is she?

315
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:32,650
- Now, you know she won't, Ben.
- Then why? For Joseph?

316
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:37,614
I held those gold plates
in my hands, Ben.

317
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:43,119
I saw the angel.
It burns like a fire in my bones, Ben.

318
00:27:43,411 --> 00:27:46,122
And you're willing to give up your family
to follow Joseph Smith?

319
00:27:46,289 --> 00:27:48,833
Are you willing to give up yours
for a piece of land?

320
00:27:58,885 --> 00:28:01,388
I'll keep an eye on Nathan
and his family for you.

321
00:28:18,738 --> 00:28:22,909
Joseph says God is calling
the Mormons to gather in Ohio,

322
00:28:23,451 --> 00:28:26,329
but I think they wore out
their welcome in New York.

323
00:28:26,996 --> 00:28:31,042
They scare folks.
Voting together, buying together.

324
00:28:32,168 --> 00:28:35,672
Anyway, they'd come to Kirtland
dirt poor, most of them,

325
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,590
ready to start again.

326
00:28:56,359 --> 00:28:57,819
Kirtland is growing.

327
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:01,906
And growing fastest
was the foolishness about the temple.

328
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:06,494
People left off building their own houses
and sowing their own fields

329
00:29:06,619 --> 00:29:08,163
to rear up a temple.

330
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:12,375
Dirt farmers trying to act like Saints.

331
00:29:15,503 --> 00:29:16,588
Joseph.

332
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:17,713
No, thank you.

333
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:21,384
Joseph, we're building a temple

334
00:29:21,509 --> 00:29:24,220
before many of our people
have a proper place to live.

335
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:26,848
That's what we're doing, right?

336
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:31,394
How long has it been since the Lord
had a temple on Earth?

337
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:35,815
Eighteen hundred years, I suppose.

338
00:29:36,983 --> 00:29:38,776
Don't you think it's about time?

339
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:43,656
Nathan, unless I'm mistaken,

340
00:29:43,781 --> 00:29:46,534
you're living in a lean-to
out back of the Whitney's,

341
00:29:46,659 --> 00:29:48,786
with a wife who's expecting any day.

342
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:51,122
That's right.
Until I can build my own place.

343
00:29:51,831 --> 00:29:53,583
Then why would you help
with this temple?

344
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:57,962
I guess 'cause you asked me to.

345
00:30:02,675 --> 00:30:07,263
We are building this temple now
because the Lord asked us to.

346
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:10,892
Nathan, Ma said you got to come.

347
00:30:12,268 --> 00:30:13,311
Lydia.

348
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,028
Ma! Ma!

349
00:30:25,823 --> 00:30:28,993
Nathan. It's good to see you, son.

350
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:31,704
Look at him!

351
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:39,045
- Pa, what are you doing here?
- Lt looks like the Lord opened a way.

352
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:41,214
- Joseph.
- Welcome to Kirtland, Ben.

353
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:44,300
- Brother Steed.
- Did you sell your farm?

354
00:30:45,134 --> 00:30:47,595
No. And I'm not going to.

355
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:52,016
I'm here just long enough to build
Nathan and Lydia a decent place

356
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:54,269
and then we're going home.

357
00:30:55,311 --> 00:30:56,563
Fair enough.

358
00:30:57,981 --> 00:31:02,694
Martin, thank you for coming,
and for bringing so many with you.

359
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:05,113
Wherever you are, Joseph.

360
00:31:10,076 --> 00:31:13,329
Parley, why don't you tell the Steeds
what you found in Missouri?

361
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:17,709
I found Joshua.

362
00:31:51,117 --> 00:31:52,910
I can't. I can't.

363
00:31:53,536 --> 00:31:55,163
Lydia, look at me.

364
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:59,208
You're stronger than you know.

365
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:01,794
You bear down, girl.

366
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:05,798
The Lord will give you strength, child,
don't you doubt it.

367
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:09,302
That's it.

368
00:32:14,223 --> 00:32:17,727
Good. Bear down. Bear down. Good.

369
00:32:19,228 --> 00:32:20,855
- It's coming.
- Bear down.

370
00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:26,110
You've done it.

371
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:04,816
Looks like you've gotten yourself
a little Nathan.

372
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:23,876
Grandpa.

373
00:33:35,722 --> 00:33:36,889
Good morning.

374
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:40,685
- Ben.
- How are you?

375
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:46,315
I've asked Brother Phelps and
Brother Partridge to serve as witnesses.

376
00:33:47,233 --> 00:33:51,362
They'll be leaving for Missouri
next week to establish a printing press

377
00:33:51,487 --> 00:33:54,490
that will publish the revelations
the Lord has given us.

378
00:33:54,574 --> 00:33:57,660
Is that where Zion will finally be,
Joseph? In Missouri?

379
00:33:58,745 --> 00:34:01,998
You told us once that Zion was more
than just a place.

380
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:04,000
It is, Nathan.

381
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:08,588
Zion is the city the Lord will build
for His people.

382
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:11,007
Where there will be no poor among us

383
00:34:12,257 --> 00:34:14,927
and we will all be
of one heart and one mind.

384
00:34:19,389 --> 00:34:23,436
Now, let's bless this baby
and give him a name.

385
00:34:38,618 --> 00:34:43,206
Father in Heaven,
we hold this child in our hands

386
00:34:43,664 --> 00:34:46,000
so that through your holy priesthood,

387
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:49,420
we may give him a name
and a blessing.

388
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:53,882
And the name he shall carry
throughout his life will be...

389
00:34:59,013 --> 00:35:00,807
And the name we give him is...

390
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:13,444
His name is Joshua Benjamin Steed.

391
00:35:36,342 --> 00:35:39,011
Hey, Pa, I've got some nails coming up
for you.

392
00:35:39,345 --> 00:35:40,471
No, bring the others.

393
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:47,060
Ben.

394
00:35:49,355 --> 00:35:51,107
Have you met Brigham Young yet?

395
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:53,901
He came over from New York
just after you did.

396
00:35:54,902 --> 00:35:58,781
- Good to meet you, Brother Steed.
- Just Ben will be fine, thank you.

397
00:35:59,156 --> 00:36:02,034
Ben, we've been sent by Brother Joseph

398
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:04,328
to give you a hand
on Nathan's house here.

399
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:06,914
He said to thank you
for your help on the temple.

400
00:36:07,164 --> 00:36:08,749
I haven't helped on the temple.

401
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:13,546
That might be why he was smiling
when he said it.

402
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:16,299
All the same, here we are.

403
00:36:17,466 --> 00:36:20,261
- Mr. Young, is it? ls it Bingham, is it?
- Brigham.

404
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:22,597
Well, Brigham, thank you for your offer.

405
00:36:23,055 --> 00:36:24,974
But as you can see,
we're doing just fine.

406
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:28,185
It's no trouble at all. Come on, brethren.

407
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:31,480
Why don't you head around back?

408
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:43,826
Go get the measure for me.
It's right over there.

409
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:49,290
- Martin?
- Ben.

410
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:52,335
Ben, where are you hiding
those nine penny nails?

411
00:36:59,091 --> 00:37:00,176
Afternoon, Miss Steed.

412
00:37:00,259 --> 00:37:04,722
Carl Rogers, you're not a Mormon.
What are you doing here?

413
00:37:04,847 --> 00:37:07,558
I don't know. I saw a house going up.

414
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:10,186
I thought maybe I could lend a hand
if you don't mind.

415
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:11,896
I don't mind.

416
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:31,499
Brother Steed.

417
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:37,630
- Good job, Mr. Young.
- Brigham.

418
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:41,717
Thank you, Pa.

419
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:46,639
So, now that we've got a roof
over our heads,

420
00:37:47,264 --> 00:37:49,642
how long before you head back
to Palmyra?

421
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,452
Didn't I tell you I'd make it back
before Friday, huh?

422
00:38:08,577 --> 00:38:09,912
Half day to spare, too.

423
00:38:09,996 --> 00:38:13,207
Pigeon. Tell Bobby Johnson
he owes me $5.

424
00:38:13,332 --> 00:38:16,836
I'll do that. Wilson Everett stopped by
twice while you were gone.

425
00:38:16,919 --> 00:38:18,397
Does he want to lose
more money to me?

426
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:19,880
Something like that, I'm sure.

427
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:22,508
Well, I may have to oblige him.
I need a drink.

428
00:38:27,346 --> 00:38:29,724
Jessie. Jess.

429
00:38:31,517 --> 00:38:33,269
- What's wrong?
- Get dressed.

430
00:38:34,311 --> 00:38:35,521
Joshua.

431
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:38,649
- Just cut your losses and walk away.
- I can't.

432
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:41,861
- Yes. Yes, you can.
- Do you want me to lose everything?

433
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:44,697
Now, I told him I was coming back here
to get some more money.

434
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:47,283
I just need your help
to get things turned around.

435
00:38:47,366 --> 00:38:49,326
- You know what to do.
- Joshua!

436
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:54,582
You promised.
Don't ask me to do that, please.

437
00:38:55,624 --> 00:38:57,001
I'm not asking.

438
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:11,057
I'll take three.

439
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:34,014
You know what,
I got a bad feeling about this one.

440
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:35,748
I think I'm gonna get out now.

441
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:38,876
Pair of sixes, queen high.
What have you got?

442
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,129
Pair of tens.

443
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:45,257
Good move.
Looks like your luck might be turning.

444
00:39:48,427 --> 00:39:51,013
How about we get another deck
from the house?

445
00:39:52,431 --> 00:39:54,892
- It's fine by me.
- New deck, Clint!

446
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:11,784
What do you say, we put the kids
to bed and play some real poker?

447
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:15,746
- Fifty to open, heads up.
- All right.

448
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:20,167
Heard say you got yourself a wife.
Is that right?

449
00:40:20,876 --> 00:40:22,419
That's right. Ante up.

450
00:40:24,547 --> 00:40:26,298
Is she a pretty little thing?

451
00:40:27,299 --> 00:40:29,552
- Who?
- Your wife.

452
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:34,098
- She's pretty, huh?
- Yeah, that's what people say.

453
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:38,060
You want to talk about my wife
or you want to play some cards?

454
00:40:41,355 --> 00:40:42,398
Two hundred.

455
00:40:57,913 --> 00:40:59,641
Hey, you know what,
I'm getting kind of tired.

456
00:40:59,665 --> 00:41:04,545
So, I'll see your $200, raise you $150.

457
00:41:09,341 --> 00:41:10,467
Fine.

458
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:15,431
- How many cards you need?
- One.

459
00:41:17,683 --> 00:41:19,476
And I'll take two.

460
00:41:22,855 --> 00:41:24,148
Bet you $300.

461
00:41:25,941 --> 00:41:28,277
Looks like you're a little shy of that.

462
00:41:29,361 --> 00:41:33,073
Well, I've got four Conestogas outside
and the teams to pull them.

463
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:34,783
That ought to cover it.

464
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:38,329
I guess that means
winner takes everything.

465
00:41:38,454 --> 00:41:39,705
I guess so.

466
00:41:42,917 --> 00:41:44,168
All right.

467
00:41:45,502 --> 00:41:46,712
Lay them down.

468
00:41:48,255 --> 00:41:52,885
Full house. Aces full. Sorry, Everett.

469
00:41:56,555 --> 00:41:58,265
Not as sorry as I am.

470
00:42:00,893 --> 00:42:02,811
Straight flush, Mr. Steed.

471
00:42:23,582 --> 00:42:26,293
Jessie! Jessie, wait!

472
00:42:27,753 --> 00:42:29,171
Joshua, no!

473
00:42:29,255 --> 00:42:32,091
What did you do? What did you do?

474
00:42:33,759 --> 00:42:36,053
I've lost everything because of you.
You know that?

475
00:42:36,178 --> 00:42:39,139
I've lost everything because of you!
Do you hear me, little girl?

476
00:42:39,265 --> 00:42:42,184
- Joshua, no, please!
- Leave the lady alone!

477
00:42:51,777 --> 00:42:52,861
Stop!

478
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:03,372
The Mormons outnumber
the old settlers in Kirtland.

479
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:07,585
Their new Mormon neighbors
make them uneasy.

480
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:14,049
The wild stories and the threats
are following Joseph to Ohio.

481
00:43:27,021 --> 00:43:28,689
- Hello.
- Hello.

482
00:43:29,857 --> 00:43:34,611
- Has his fever broken yet?
- Not yet. He's been like this for hours.

483
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:39,783
- I'll take him.
- Okay.

484
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:44,330
You try and get some sleep.

485
00:44:13,275 --> 00:44:16,445
No! Emma, stay back!

486
00:44:17,821 --> 00:44:19,323
Emma, take the baby!

487
00:44:19,406 --> 00:44:22,284
Didn't see us coming, did you?
What kind of prophet are you?

488
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:25,537
Stop fighting or we'll
get your little wife!

489
00:45:29,768 --> 00:45:33,689
Oh, baby. My dear Emma.

490
00:45:42,448 --> 00:45:44,158
Let me, dear.

491
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:53,584
Mother.

492
00:45:59,756 --> 00:46:03,260
Sweetheart. Let go.

493
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:07,306
Let go. Let go.

494
00:46:08,348 --> 00:46:09,348
No.

495
00:46:11,059 --> 00:46:14,813
No, please! Don't do it. Don't take him.

496
00:46:16,106 --> 00:46:17,316
Don't take him.

497
00:46:55,354 --> 00:46:56,396
Parley.

498
00:47:36,061 --> 00:47:40,023
We thought Zion was in Ohio,
but we were wrong.

499
00:47:40,816 --> 00:47:43,735
Joseph sent one of his apostles,
Parley Pratt,

500
00:47:43,819 --> 00:47:46,113
out to Missouri to buy up land
for the real Zion.

501
00:47:51,743 --> 00:47:54,580
You're looking at the Mormon Zion
as they call it.

502
00:47:55,414 --> 00:47:56,582
See all those huts?

503
00:47:58,083 --> 00:47:59,626
Weren't even there two weeks ago.

504
00:48:01,587 --> 00:48:04,172
Here's Partridge's place.
That's where she is.

505
00:48:04,464 --> 00:48:06,800
Let me give you some advice, my friend.

506
00:48:07,926 --> 00:48:10,512
Start over. She's trash anyway.

507
00:48:12,306 --> 00:48:13,348
Joshua.

508
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:26,320
Jessica.

509
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:29,448
Jessie.

510
00:48:41,126 --> 00:48:42,461
I'm sorry, Jess.

511
00:48:44,254 --> 00:48:47,799
I'm real sorry. Come home, Jessie.

512
00:48:50,927 --> 00:48:52,179
I need you.

513
00:48:52,971 --> 00:48:56,141
I promise you,
I will never hurt you again.

514
00:48:56,975 --> 00:48:58,977
It'll be like it never happened.

515
00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:03,607
But it did happen. Joshua, it happened.

516
00:49:07,486 --> 00:49:10,030
I am not going to have my wife
and my child

517
00:49:10,155 --> 00:49:12,616
living in some hut
with a bunch of Mormons.

518
00:49:12,908 --> 00:49:13,992
Now, come on.

519
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:19,122
That's enough. You step away from her.

520
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:22,668
- Now.
- This is my wife!

521
00:49:25,212 --> 00:49:28,256
- And you cannot keep her here.
- No, we can't.

522
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:31,510
But she's welcome to stay,
as long as she wants.

523
00:49:34,346 --> 00:49:35,472
Please go.

524
00:49:37,432 --> 00:49:40,352
They say there's too many of you
in these parts. Maybe they're right.

525
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:42,979
The Saints are coming to Zion,
Mr. Steed.

526
00:49:43,063 --> 00:49:44,773
So, you better get used to it.

527
00:49:45,524 --> 00:49:48,735
- This is our land.
- We'll see.

528
00:49:50,278 --> 00:49:53,323
- We'll see.
- Josh?

529
00:50:07,129 --> 00:50:10,257
These people truly believe
that all this land belongs to them

530
00:50:10,382 --> 00:50:11,967
whether they pay for it or not.

531
00:50:12,050 --> 00:50:16,805
Granted to them by God Himself.
It's their Zion, their Utopia.

532
00:50:17,347 --> 00:50:18,849
That's what Joe Smith tells them.

533
00:50:18,932 --> 00:50:22,811
Frankly, I don't care
about Joe Smith or angels

534
00:50:22,894 --> 00:50:24,187
or any of that hogwash.

535
00:50:24,312 --> 00:50:27,190
The fact is we've
got abolitionist neighbors.

536
00:50:27,733 --> 00:50:30,360
They're even inviting freed slaves
to come up the Missouri.

537
00:50:30,444 --> 00:50:32,154
I've got it right here in their own words.

538
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:35,699
Now, this is from their printing press
that's not a stone's throw from here.

539
00:50:35,782 --> 00:50:38,118
They're inviting freed slaves, Sam.

540
00:50:39,327 --> 00:50:42,414
They ain't just printing
Joe Smith's revelations over there.

541
00:50:42,539 --> 00:50:45,751
Now religion's one thing,
but you start interfering with slavery

542
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:47,716
and suddenly all of our business
from the South

543
00:50:47,753 --> 00:50:49,296
won't come up the Missouri anymore.

544
00:50:49,421 --> 00:50:52,758
I got Mormons on three sides of
my property out there in Kaw Township.

545
00:50:52,883 --> 00:50:54,217
Well, shoot them.

546
00:50:59,014 --> 00:51:01,141
- Lieutenant Governor Boggs.
- Gentlemen.

547
00:51:02,934 --> 00:51:04,644
You have anything to add?

548
00:51:05,228 --> 00:51:08,732
I was just wondering
what Mr. Steed here feels about all this.

549
00:51:09,691 --> 00:51:12,944
I want them out.
I have my own reasons.

550
00:51:13,236 --> 00:51:16,239
As do I. As do I.

551
00:51:17,949 --> 00:51:20,368
Look, you all know I'm here unofficially.

552
00:51:21,203 --> 00:51:22,746
But it seems evident to me

553
00:51:22,829 --> 00:51:27,167
that the effects of this rapid influx of
Mormons could not have been foreseen.

554
00:51:27,292 --> 00:51:30,086
Therefore, our laws are not prepared
to deal with them.

555
00:51:30,962 --> 00:51:35,300
And if we wait for legislation, the delays
will put the mischief beyond all remedy.

556
00:51:36,593 --> 00:51:39,012
- Gentlemen, the Mormons have to go.
- Amen.

557
00:51:39,262 --> 00:51:42,474
For the good of Jackson County
and I believe as American citizens

558
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:47,103
it is our duty to help them on their way.

559
00:51:48,355 --> 00:51:52,818
Peaceably, if we can.
Forcibly, if we must.

560
00:51:56,029 --> 00:51:57,948
The only question should be,

561
00:51:59,866 --> 00:52:01,743
when and how.

562
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:06,456
We go now. Right now.
And we shut down this press.

563
00:52:07,582 --> 00:52:10,585
For a glass of whiskey,
we'll raise ourselves an army.

564
00:52:36,111 --> 00:52:38,031
Edward, I've got to go down
and try to stop them.

565
00:52:38,154 --> 00:52:40,156
Whatever happens, save the Book!

566
00:52:45,829 --> 00:52:49,541
No! No, no, no!

567
00:52:49,666 --> 00:52:50,709
Gentlemen, gentlemen.

568
00:52:52,669 --> 00:52:55,088
Please, you have no right.

569
00:52:58,925 --> 00:53:02,137
You attacking me, Phelps?
Is that what this has come to?

570
00:53:02,888 --> 00:53:04,264
You have no right.

571
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:08,184
You all saw it.
I was attacked without provocation.

572
00:53:11,563 --> 00:53:13,565
We're well within our rights
to defend ourselves.

573
00:53:13,648 --> 00:53:15,317
Yeah!

574
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:17,736
So then, defend yourselves.

575
00:53:19,446 --> 00:53:21,072
Come on!

576
00:53:59,945 --> 00:54:01,988
I just have one question for you.

577
00:54:02,405 --> 00:54:04,491
Where is Joe Smith
when you need him?

578
00:54:06,534 --> 00:54:08,078
That's what I thought.

579
00:54:09,204 --> 00:54:11,748
So, what are we going to do
about the Mormons?

580
00:54:15,251 --> 00:54:17,462
I don't want to sound unreasonable,

581
00:54:19,047 --> 00:54:20,441
but there is a way out of this mess.

582
00:54:20,465 --> 00:54:21,591
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

583
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:24,636
- Renounce Joe Smith.
- Yeah.

584
00:54:25,553 --> 00:54:26,888
I cannot do that.

585
00:54:29,349 --> 00:54:30,684
What did you say?

586
00:54:32,602 --> 00:54:35,438
I will not deny what I know to be true.

587
00:54:36,314 --> 00:54:39,859
Sure as I know God lives,
I know Joseph is His prophet.

588
00:54:46,116 --> 00:54:47,784
I met your father, Mr. Steed.

589
00:54:51,538 --> 00:54:52,872
He's a good man.

590
00:55:01,506 --> 00:55:03,842
- That'll teach you.
- Yeah.

591
00:55:10,557 --> 00:55:11,766
Ouch.

592
00:55:15,812 --> 00:55:16,896
Strip 'em.

593
00:56:24,756 --> 00:56:26,633
They call this the Whitmer Settlement.

594
00:56:26,716 --> 00:56:30,595
It's about 20 cabins right on
the Big Blue just below the ferry.

595
00:56:30,678 --> 00:56:34,557
Now it's mostly trees all the way in,
so we've got cover.

596
00:56:34,641 --> 00:56:35,743
We've nothing to worry about.

597
00:56:35,767 --> 00:56:38,353
Now, I've seen them gathering
like flies down at Kaw Township.

598
00:56:38,436 --> 00:56:40,372
Why don't we start there
and just work our way up?

599
00:56:40,396 --> 00:56:43,358
No. No. Not yet.
We're gonna start up here

600
00:56:43,441 --> 00:56:45,377
and move our way down
to the Coleville Settlement.

601
00:56:45,401 --> 00:56:47,612
All right. All right.
All right, you men ready?

602
00:56:47,737 --> 00:56:49,656
- Yeah!
- Let's go.

603
00:57:03,211 --> 00:57:07,257
I seen her, Mr. Steed. I seen the baby.
They're still in the same place.

604
00:57:09,425 --> 00:57:11,427
I need you to do something else
for me, all right?

605
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:17,183
Edward, get the word out here.
I'm on my way to the Colesville Branch.

606
00:57:17,308 --> 00:57:19,477
The mobs have already hit
the Whitmer Settlement!

607
00:57:19,644 --> 00:57:21,288
Get your women
and your young ones together.

608
00:57:21,312 --> 00:57:23,356
We're gonna go!
We're gonna move them to Colesville.

609
00:57:23,481 --> 00:57:25,316
Let's go! They're coming this way!

610
00:57:25,775 --> 00:57:29,279
Dear Jessica.
I hope this letter finds you in time.

611
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:34,576
You got to get out now, Jess.
Come back to Independence.

612
00:57:35,034 --> 00:57:37,245
The Mormons will leave
Jackson County.

613
00:57:37,328 --> 00:57:39,038
Nothing can stop that now.

614
00:57:39,998 --> 00:57:42,417
But you must not be there
when it happens.

615
00:57:43,209 --> 00:57:45,253
Take the baby and run.

616
00:57:49,799 --> 00:57:51,634
Now, come on out, nice and easy.

617
00:57:52,343 --> 00:57:55,096
We'll go take a little walk.
Come on. Let's go!

618
00:57:55,597 --> 00:57:58,016
- George, I know you.
- I said, move!

619
00:57:58,433 --> 00:58:01,311
- Get your hands off her!
- Joshua.

620
00:58:04,898 --> 00:58:06,858
- I told you to leave.
- And go where?

621
00:58:06,983 --> 00:58:09,360
Jessica, you need to come
with me right now. They're coming.

622
00:58:09,444 --> 00:58:11,487
Joshua, these are women and children.

623
00:58:11,613 --> 00:58:15,033
- Jess, they just want the Mormons out.
- I am a Mormon!

624
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:17,785
Come on, Joshua. We got to move.

625
00:58:17,994 --> 00:58:20,747
Do you really think we'd be safe
in Independence?

626
00:58:22,874 --> 00:58:24,667
Just bring the baby and come back.

627
00:58:25,710 --> 00:58:28,755
- Please.
- "It'll be like it never happened"?

628
00:58:31,424 --> 00:58:32,675
Jess.

629
00:58:35,053 --> 00:58:36,346
What's her name?

630
00:58:37,722 --> 00:58:38,890
Rachel.

631
00:59:03,206 --> 00:59:06,334
Jessie, if you would just
give me one more chance.

632
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:10,505
I can't tell you how sorry I am
I hurt you that night.

633
00:59:12,131 --> 00:59:14,676
If I could turn things back, I would.

634
00:59:16,177 --> 00:59:19,889
Just know that I will never do
anything again to cause you pain.

635
00:59:21,975 --> 00:59:23,851
Your feet are bleeding.

636
00:59:27,105 --> 00:59:28,439
Mine are, too.

637
00:59:31,025 --> 00:59:33,903
I guess Pa won't have any trouble
finding us.

638
00:59:34,862 --> 00:59:36,239
Come back, Jessie.

639
00:59:37,991 --> 00:59:41,869
I need to hold my daughter
and my wife.

640
00:59:44,122 --> 00:59:45,206
Joshua.

641
01:00:06,311 --> 01:00:07,895
I still don't understand it.

642
01:00:10,773 --> 01:00:13,318
Dirt poor Mormon converts
working on the temple

643
01:00:13,443 --> 01:00:15,862
just because Joseph asked them to.

644
01:00:16,904 --> 01:00:18,531
Giving everything.

645
01:00:19,198 --> 01:00:21,743
Finishing the temple is an obsession.

646
01:00:22,493 --> 01:00:24,162
To show their faith.

647
01:00:25,079 --> 01:00:26,748
It's a sight to see.

648
01:00:58,363 --> 01:01:00,406
- Good day.
- Good day to you.

649
01:01:00,531 --> 01:01:04,410
I and some of my congregation
have come to see the Mormons.

650
01:01:04,535 --> 01:01:07,205
- Are you Mormons?
- I am.

651
01:01:09,457 --> 01:01:13,002
Did you come to help, Ben?
Or did you just find religion?

652
01:01:13,711 --> 01:01:15,755
- Good morning, Joseph.
- Good morning.

653
01:01:16,130 --> 01:01:18,841
Do I have the privilege of standing
before a prophet of God?

654
01:01:18,925 --> 01:01:21,594
You might. Do you wanna wrestle?

655
01:01:24,013 --> 01:01:26,265
Well, we... That is...

656
01:01:27,016 --> 01:01:29,936
We were wanting to question you
on a few matters.

657
01:01:30,561 --> 01:01:33,731
- All right. Brother...
- Ezra Booth.

658
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:35,441
How can I help you, Brother Booth?

659
01:01:35,566 --> 01:01:37,443
- Can we go?
- No.

660
01:01:37,777 --> 01:01:40,822
Well, to cut to the heart of it,
do you actually believe, sir,

661
01:01:40,905 --> 01:01:43,074
that you are a prophet
like Moses or Abraham?

662
01:01:43,908 --> 01:01:47,870
I don't think that what you believe
and what I believe are all that different.

663
01:01:47,954 --> 01:01:50,790
You believe that God used
to talk to man.

664
01:01:51,541 --> 01:01:53,251
I believe that He still does.

665
01:01:53,709 --> 01:01:55,920
Well, surely, sir, then if you're a
prophet,

666
01:01:56,003 --> 01:01:58,423
you can heal
dear Sister Elsa Johnson here,

667
01:01:58,506 --> 01:02:00,842
her arm being stricken
these many years.

668
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:02,300
Parley!

669
01:02:16,983 --> 01:02:19,110
Parley. Parley.

670
01:02:21,070 --> 01:02:22,280
Joseph.

671
01:02:22,989 --> 01:02:26,075
- Parley, what happened?
- Zion is...

672
01:02:27,285 --> 01:02:28,703
Zion is no more.

673
01:02:32,290 --> 01:02:34,792
Nathan, get him to the house.
He's freezing.

674
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:38,171
Brigham, can you run
and tell Emma we're coming?

675
01:03:00,776 --> 01:03:04,780
Sister Elsa Johnson, do you believe
that the Lord can heal you?

676
01:03:09,994 --> 01:03:13,039
Then in the name of Jesus Christ,
I command you to be whole.

677
01:03:37,230 --> 01:03:39,565
They'd already driven our women
and our children

678
01:03:39,690 --> 01:03:42,068
over into Clay County
before we got back.

679
01:03:43,528 --> 01:03:46,447
It was the dead of night,
more than 16 miles in the snow.

680
01:03:47,823 --> 01:03:49,617
By the time we found them,

681
01:03:50,284 --> 01:03:52,995
one of them had died,
the Ralstons' little girl.

682
01:03:54,914 --> 01:03:58,459
They didn't even give us
a couple of days to collect our things.

683
01:04:04,799 --> 01:04:08,010
There are no Saints
in Jackson County, Joseph.

684
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:11,180
Zion is lost.

685
01:04:14,308 --> 01:04:16,018
We are but a handful here.

686
01:04:20,481 --> 01:04:22,108
But this church,

687
01:04:23,901 --> 01:04:26,445
will fill North and South America.

688
01:04:29,907 --> 01:04:32,034
And one day, it will fill the world.

689
01:04:34,537 --> 01:04:36,581
It will fill the Rocky Mountains.

690
01:04:38,708 --> 01:04:41,752
There will be tens of thousands
of Saints gathered there.

691
01:04:47,925 --> 01:04:49,885
Zion is what God has commanded.

692
01:04:51,971 --> 01:04:55,891
How can we fulfill His purposes
if we do not go in there and redeem it?

693
01:04:59,061 --> 01:05:02,273
I'm going to Zion
if I have to march there on foot.

694
01:05:04,066 --> 01:05:07,445
Those farms are ours.
We paid for that land.

695
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:10,531
And the Lord would have us come
to the aid of our brothers and sisters

696
01:05:10,615 --> 01:05:12,158
and set things aright.

697
01:05:15,911 --> 01:05:17,788
By force, if necessary.

698
01:05:29,133 --> 01:05:33,054
- Good morning, Sister Steed. Ben.
- Good morning, Joseph.

699
01:05:34,013 --> 01:05:35,139
Joseph.

700
01:05:35,556 --> 01:05:38,601
You've heard we're marching
to Missouri to repair what's been done?

701
01:05:40,019 --> 01:05:41,187
I heard.

702
01:05:42,605 --> 01:05:44,482
And you've heard that Nathan
has volunteered?

703
01:05:46,942 --> 01:05:49,487
I'm sure that he would have been
one of the first.

704
01:05:51,113 --> 01:05:52,365
Probably right.

705
01:05:53,991 --> 01:05:55,868
You sold your farm in Palmyra.

706
01:05:57,078 --> 01:05:58,287
I did.

707
01:05:58,788 --> 01:06:02,750
Ben, I know I haven't been able to
convince you to help with the temple,

708
01:06:02,833 --> 01:06:05,252
but can I convince you
to leave your family,

709
01:06:05,378 --> 01:06:09,799
risk life and limb, march
1,000 miles to help redeem Zion?

710
01:06:16,764 --> 01:06:18,849
You know all this trouble in Missouri,

711
01:06:20,726 --> 01:06:22,603
Joshua's right in the middle of it.

712
01:06:57,054 --> 01:07:01,142
We set out for Missouri
on the fifth of May, 1 834.

713
01:07:02,226 --> 01:07:04,103
A thousand miles ahead of us.

714
01:07:05,062 --> 01:07:08,149
Two hundred and five men, 25 wagons,

715
01:07:08,983 --> 01:07:13,863
carrying our own muskets and
bayonets, powder and shot, and tools.

716
01:07:14,572 --> 01:07:17,116
Tools and supplies
for the Mormons we hope

717
01:07:17,533 --> 01:07:20,035
will get their homes back
in Jackson County.

718
01:07:20,786 --> 01:07:23,748
We survive on johnnycake
and corn dodgers.

719
01:07:24,415 --> 01:07:26,041
The water is bad.

720
01:07:29,253 --> 01:07:31,672
Joseph is leading like he was born to it.

721
01:07:48,105 --> 01:07:50,858
- You awake?
- Yeah.

722
01:07:53,694 --> 01:07:56,322
This ground is hard as a rock.

723
01:07:58,783 --> 01:08:02,995
Did I ever tell you it took me two years
to decide to become a Mormon?

724
01:08:05,581 --> 01:08:06,707
No.

725
01:08:07,958 --> 01:08:09,126
Oh, yeah.

726
01:08:11,295 --> 01:08:16,217
Everybody around me was practically
jumping in the water, but not me.

727
01:08:16,717 --> 01:08:18,094
I was...

728
01:08:20,805 --> 01:08:22,473
Now, you've got me beat, Ben.

729
01:08:26,810 --> 01:08:28,813
You both have me beat by a mile.

730
01:08:29,522 --> 01:08:32,566
I was one of those eager folks
jumping right in.

731
01:08:32,774 --> 01:08:35,277
Truth be told though, I might
have had some second thoughts,

732
01:08:35,361 --> 01:08:37,696
but then I met Joseph.

733
01:08:39,073 --> 01:08:41,867
Have you ever been with him
when he speaks the revelation?

734
01:08:42,868 --> 01:08:45,955
Well, I have.
Say what you want about Joseph Smith

735
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:49,125
but when you've seen him speak
in the name of the Lord,

736
01:08:51,001 --> 01:08:53,796
the light in his eyes
and his countenance,

737
01:08:54,797 --> 01:08:56,756
there's just no room for doubt.

738
01:08:58,175 --> 01:08:59,885
At least there wasn't for me.

739
01:09:01,594 --> 01:09:03,264
Tearing my family apart.

740
01:09:04,889 --> 01:09:07,476
It's picking it up
and ripping it into pieces.

741
01:09:09,812 --> 01:09:13,065
All this talk of prophets and revelations.

742
01:09:13,732 --> 01:09:16,360
Seems like a man just about
has to give up everything he's got

743
01:09:16,485 --> 01:09:18,696
in order to try and hold things together.

744
01:09:18,821 --> 01:09:20,197
Nathan, you awake?

745
01:09:22,366 --> 01:09:23,576
Sure am.

746
01:09:24,743 --> 01:09:27,037
What are you gonna do
when we get to Missouri?

747
01:09:28,371 --> 01:09:31,959
I mean, we all know who's there.

748
01:09:35,546 --> 01:09:36,755
I don't know.

749
01:09:40,009 --> 01:09:42,051
Guess I'll do what has to be done.

750
01:09:47,390 --> 01:09:52,313
Oh, Lord, please watch over
our husbands and kinsmen.

751
01:09:54,773 --> 01:09:57,693
Help guide their hearts.
Give them strength.

752
01:10:00,112 --> 01:10:02,281
Their mission is in Your name, Lord.

753
01:10:03,574 --> 01:10:08,245
Please protect them
and return them home safely to us.

754
01:10:10,496 --> 01:10:12,249
They're coming, boys.

755
01:10:15,960 --> 01:10:17,671
Lieutenant Governor Boggs.

756
01:10:20,424 --> 01:10:23,219
I wanna thank you men
for coming out here to meet me in...

757
01:10:24,469 --> 01:10:25,804
Wherever we are.

758
01:10:30,559 --> 01:10:34,605
You all know the need for delicacy
in this matter, given my current office

759
01:10:34,730 --> 01:10:37,900
and the disposition
of our good Governor Dunklin.

760
01:10:38,609 --> 01:10:39,818
Amen.

761
01:10:40,443 --> 01:10:42,987
There's something I thought
you should know.

762
01:10:44,448 --> 01:10:45,950
The Mormons have raised an army

763
01:10:46,075 --> 01:10:48,952
and are marching toward Missouri
even as we speak.

764
01:10:49,912 --> 01:10:52,039
Led by Joe Smith himself.

765
01:10:52,414 --> 01:10:57,127
They are intent on driving us out
of their land of Zion.

766
01:10:57,210 --> 01:11:00,130
Now they say the Mormons crossed
into Missouri three days ago.

767
01:11:00,255 --> 01:11:03,384
Say they're going to kill anyone
who stands in their way.

768
01:11:03,467 --> 01:11:07,513
Since our good Governor is unwilling
to raise the militia to protect us,

769
01:11:08,806 --> 01:11:12,518
it is time for the common man
to rise up in the face of a great evil.

770
01:11:13,811 --> 01:11:18,440
My hands are tied, gentlemen.
I'm asking you to do what I can't do.

771
01:11:55,102 --> 01:11:56,812
Hold steady, boys.

772
01:12:02,109 --> 01:12:05,571
If they want trouble, we'll give it
to them, but we'll not be starting it.

773
01:12:11,493 --> 01:12:12,870
That's far enough.

774
01:12:25,466 --> 01:12:26,800
You're Joe Smith?

775
01:12:27,384 --> 01:12:29,303
- What do you want?
- This is it?

776
01:12:29,762 --> 01:12:33,098
This is the big Mormon army
we've been hearing about?

777
01:12:33,974 --> 01:12:37,186
If you have business with us,
I suggest you get on with it.

778
01:12:37,436 --> 01:12:39,228
If not, I suggest you leave.

779
01:12:39,438 --> 01:12:41,732
Oh, we've got business
with you, all right.

780
01:12:41,898 --> 01:12:45,611
We got 200 of the best boys from
Jackson County down at Williams Ferry.

781
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:50,157
We've got 70 coming in from Liberty,
60 from Richmond.

782
01:12:50,240 --> 01:12:53,160
All told, we got...

783
01:12:56,996 --> 01:13:00,000
- Let's see, we got...
- 330?

784
01:13:04,463 --> 01:13:07,549
- No.
- Let it go, George.

785
01:13:07,966 --> 01:13:10,219
Hey, you'll have your fun soon enough.

786
01:13:13,764 --> 01:13:14,973
That's right.

787
01:13:16,058 --> 01:13:20,228
Let's just go get the others.
Show these Mormon boys how to die.

788
01:13:22,189 --> 01:13:24,066
Oh, by the way,

789
01:13:24,858 --> 01:13:28,570
the number will be around 500 men,
I think,

790
01:13:29,987 --> 01:13:31,365
when we come back.

791
01:13:32,241 --> 01:13:33,784
So, we'll see you soon.

792
01:13:38,455 --> 01:13:40,749
Boys, that's the Mormon army.

793
01:13:48,882 --> 01:13:50,175
Joseph.

794
01:13:50,509 --> 01:13:54,054
We can't fight them here.
I say we march quick time to Liberty.

795
01:13:54,304 --> 01:13:55,347
Forget Liberty.

796
01:13:55,472 --> 01:13:57,617
Let's follow them down to the ferry
and get the lot of them

797
01:13:57,641 --> 01:13:58,952
while they're crossing the Missouri.

798
01:13:58,976 --> 01:14:00,662
- That would be sure death.
- I agree with Brigham.

799
01:14:00,686 --> 01:14:02,353
- We should go right now!
- That's enough!

800
01:14:07,609 --> 01:14:10,154
Remember, we are here
on the Lord's errand.

801
01:14:17,661 --> 01:14:21,123
Stand still and see the salvation of God.

802
01:14:32,718 --> 01:14:34,219
First group's across.

803
01:14:43,562 --> 01:14:44,771
Will you look at that?

804
01:15:05,209 --> 01:15:07,628
There's an old church
about a half a mile back!

805
01:15:07,710 --> 01:15:10,214
- Get everyone there as fast as you can!
- All right.

806
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:50,545
I don't reckon we'll have any trouble
from those mobbers tonight.

807
01:15:52,130 --> 01:15:53,382
Let's hope not.

808
01:15:58,428 --> 01:16:00,138
Did you see Joshua there?

809
01:16:03,350 --> 01:16:04,434
And?

810
01:16:07,813 --> 01:16:10,773
One of these days you are gonna
have to forgive him, Ben.

811
01:16:11,775 --> 01:16:14,695
- I don't know if I can do that.
- Yes, you can.

812
01:16:15,779 --> 01:16:17,781
You're being a stubborn fool.

813
01:16:18,782 --> 01:16:20,492
I'm not smiling, Ben.

814
01:16:21,034 --> 01:16:23,787
You say I'm tearing your family apart.
I'm tired of it.

815
01:16:23,912 --> 01:16:26,748
What's tearing your family apart
is your pride.

816
01:16:27,499 --> 01:16:32,045
Humble yourself, Ben.
And forgive your own flesh and blood.

817
01:16:36,633 --> 01:16:40,178
It's hard when the one
who needs forgiveness won't ask for it.

818
01:16:40,846 --> 01:16:44,308
- He would never do that. Joshua's a...
- I'm not talking about Joshua.

819
01:16:44,558 --> 01:16:48,770
If you hate somebody, Ben,
it is not their fault.

820
01:16:49,271 --> 01:16:52,316
- I don't hate my son.
- Then act like it.

821
01:16:53,442 --> 01:16:55,610
Stop blaming everybody but yourself.

822
01:16:58,322 --> 01:17:01,867
I'll tell you this, one of these days
you're going to have to make a choice

823
01:17:02,659 --> 01:17:05,120
between your pride and your family.

824
01:17:14,338 --> 01:17:17,007
You have more family in Missouri
than you know.

825
01:17:28,769 --> 01:17:32,105
Letter to the honorable Daniel Dunklin,
Governor of Missouri.

826
01:17:34,858 --> 01:17:36,568
Our situation is critical.

827
01:17:37,318 --> 01:17:40,781
Our people are the victims
of outrages and even murder.

828
01:17:41,365 --> 01:17:44,993
Their property and possessions
have been stolen or destroyed

829
01:17:45,077 --> 01:17:48,288
and their families driven off
their legally-purchased land.

830
01:17:49,289 --> 01:17:51,291
We appeal to you for aid.

831
01:17:52,501 --> 01:17:55,295
Defend our rights
and let peace be restored.

832
01:17:57,255 --> 01:17:58,799
And we will ever pray.

833
01:18:02,010 --> 01:18:06,431
I was told we would be meeting
with Governor Dunklin in his office.

834
01:18:06,556 --> 01:18:09,976
Yes, unfortunately the Governor
was unable to see you.

835
01:18:10,394 --> 01:18:12,103
Asked me to do the honors.

836
01:18:13,730 --> 01:18:17,692
You can be sure you'll be fairly treated
by the Lieutenant Governor here.

837
01:18:21,071 --> 01:18:23,615
Governor Dunklin has committed
to provide us with a contingent

838
01:18:23,740 --> 01:18:27,077
of the state militia to accompany us
back into Jackson County

839
01:18:27,160 --> 01:18:29,246
and to return to us the lands
that were confiscated

840
01:18:29,371 --> 01:18:30,956
on the fifth of last November.

841
01:18:31,415 --> 01:18:33,625
We've come to effect that obligation.

842
01:18:34,584 --> 01:18:37,504
I don't know what you think
you were promised by the Governor

843
01:18:37,629 --> 01:18:39,630
or what you imagine your rights are,

844
01:18:40,924 --> 01:18:43,093
but let me make something very clear.

845
01:18:45,011 --> 01:18:48,557
You will not receive one acre,
not one rifle.

846
01:18:49,433 --> 01:18:54,062
Any Mormon sets foot in Jackson
County with mal-intent will pay for it.

847
01:18:55,021 --> 01:18:57,732
And I speak this with full authority
from the Governor.

848
01:18:58,859 --> 01:19:01,068
And I speak this
with the full authority from God

849
01:19:01,153 --> 01:19:04,614
when I tell you that any injustice
that you mete out upon His people

850
01:19:04,739 --> 01:19:06,782
will be returned upon your head

851
01:19:06,867 --> 01:19:09,452
and the people of Missouri,
a hundredfold!

852
01:19:10,370 --> 01:19:13,165
Mr. Smith, you go in there with force,

853
01:19:13,999 --> 01:19:17,294
and you've got a civil war
on your hands. ls that clear?

854
01:19:29,639 --> 01:19:32,851
We're going to disband Zion's camp,
and return to Kirtland.

855
01:19:35,103 --> 01:19:36,855
We'll see to the needs
of the Saints here

856
01:19:36,980 --> 01:19:39,983
and bring back those who wish
to come with us to Ohio.

857
01:19:45,447 --> 01:19:46,447
Joseph.

858
01:19:47,073 --> 01:19:49,951
Zion will be redeemed,
make no mistake about that.

859
01:19:52,913 --> 01:19:57,541
But it will be in God's time, not ours,

860
01:19:59,460 --> 01:20:00,670
not mine.

861
01:20:06,343 --> 01:20:07,719
What do you want me to do, Joseph?

862
01:20:11,556 --> 01:20:12,974
Thank you, Brigham.

863
01:20:16,019 --> 01:20:20,565
I'll need your help with telling the men.
I'll tell the Saints in Missouri,

864
01:20:21,273 --> 01:20:23,610
but if you could pass word along
to the captains?

865
01:20:23,777 --> 01:20:25,278
I'll take care of it.

866
01:20:28,907 --> 01:20:32,118
- This will test their faith, won't it?
- Yes.

867
01:20:36,206 --> 01:20:37,582
I believe it will.

868
01:20:44,339 --> 01:20:46,132
Same thing happened to mine.

869
01:20:50,804 --> 01:20:52,305
Why did we come here?

870
01:20:54,474 --> 01:20:56,934
Why didn't Joseph know
this would happen?

871
01:20:57,394 --> 01:20:59,271
Well, who's to say he didn't?

872
01:21:00,772 --> 01:21:02,691
You were there. You heard him.

873
01:21:03,608 --> 01:21:07,654
The Lord would have us redeem Zion
by force if necessary.

874
01:21:09,030 --> 01:21:11,282
Does God just change His mind,
Parley?

875
01:21:12,867 --> 01:21:15,077
God commands and God revokes.

876
01:21:16,746 --> 01:21:19,624
- Now, God's revoked.
- Just like that?

877
01:21:20,666 --> 01:21:23,003
I wonder what you're expecting
from a prophet.

878
01:21:23,503 --> 01:21:25,130
Why did Moses lead Israel out of Egypt,

879
01:21:25,255 --> 01:21:28,925
only to have them wander
in the wilderness for what, 40 years?

880
01:21:29,884 --> 01:21:33,305
Did he know he'd never set foot
in the Promised Land?

881
01:21:34,097 --> 01:21:38,059
- Why'd you come, son?
- Because I...

882
01:21:38,893 --> 01:21:41,896
If Joseph would've told you beforehand
how this was gonna pan out,

883
01:21:41,980 --> 01:21:43,648
would you've still come?

884
01:21:45,275 --> 01:21:46,318
Yes.

885
01:21:49,362 --> 01:21:53,407
So, it's not about Joseph. It's about you.

886
01:21:56,952 --> 01:21:58,371
Don't look now, Ben,

887
01:21:59,623 --> 01:22:02,063
but it sounds an awful lot
like you're defending Joseph there.

888
01:22:10,759 --> 01:22:11,925
Ben?

889
01:22:18,433 --> 01:22:19,976
He did try to warn us.

890
01:22:21,269 --> 01:22:23,813
There was no way
I was leaving the other sisters.

891
01:22:24,064 --> 01:22:25,190
It was a long night.

892
01:22:27,192 --> 01:22:29,611
My feet were tored up
something pretty awful,

893
01:22:29,693 --> 01:22:31,321
but those scars are fading.

894
01:22:33,490 --> 01:22:37,410
For a while there, I thought I might
lose Rachel, but she's all right now.

895
01:22:40,246 --> 01:22:42,707
Would you like to go
see your Uncle Nathan?

896
01:22:57,764 --> 01:22:59,474
We've got one of our own.

897
01:23:02,018 --> 01:23:03,353
Named him Joshua.

898
01:23:06,064 --> 01:23:09,484
You know every once in a while,
I catch glimpses of a good man.

899
01:23:10,276 --> 01:23:12,862
I guess that's
who I fell in love with, but...

900
01:23:15,073 --> 01:23:17,742
I do believe somebody can get
through to him.

901
01:23:19,202 --> 01:23:20,495
It just ain't me.

902
01:23:28,085 --> 01:23:31,005
Nathan. Nathan!

903
01:24:15,550 --> 01:24:16,760
Hey!

904
01:24:22,139 --> 01:24:23,349
Nathan.

905
01:24:26,936 --> 01:24:28,146
All right.

906
01:24:29,481 --> 01:24:30,982
Let's try this again.

907
01:24:31,648 --> 01:24:34,402
Are you or are you not a Mormon?

908
01:24:35,487 --> 01:24:37,906
My name is Nate Morgan.

909
01:24:38,823 --> 01:24:41,534
- I'm an old friend of Joshua...
- An old friend of Joshua Steed's.

910
01:24:41,618 --> 01:24:43,244
Yeah, I know, I got that part.

911
01:24:45,789 --> 01:24:48,500
Ouch. You're gonna feel that
in the morning.

912
01:25:09,062 --> 01:25:11,272
Easy. Easy.

913
01:25:25,954 --> 01:25:27,996
- How's Ma?
- She's fine.

914
01:25:31,459 --> 01:25:33,169
Melissa's getting married.

915
01:25:34,295 --> 01:25:38,591
And Ma still prays for you every night.

916
01:25:39,843 --> 01:25:41,177
Why did you come?

917
01:25:45,514 --> 01:25:46,891
You're my brother.

918
01:25:51,813 --> 01:25:55,775
- What, are you here to save me?
- I'm not out to save you, Joshua.

919
01:25:59,362 --> 01:26:01,072
We want you to come home.

920
01:26:05,368 --> 01:26:06,786
Is that all of you?

921
01:26:11,916 --> 01:26:13,459
That's what I thought.

922
01:26:19,048 --> 01:26:21,593
Why didn't you bring Joe Smith
with you, huh?

923
01:26:23,052 --> 01:26:25,013
Can't he solve all this for us?

924
01:26:30,143 --> 01:26:34,188
Or is he slinking back to Ohio with
the rest of the Mormon army, is that it?

925
01:26:34,939 --> 01:26:38,776
- If you just went to Pa first, I know...
- You didn't answer my question.

926
01:26:41,446 --> 01:26:43,323
Joe Smith going back to Ohio?

927
01:26:43,656 --> 01:26:47,327
I don't know what you have against
Joseph. He's done nothing to you.

928
01:26:48,827 --> 01:26:51,414
Oh, no. He ain't done nothing to me.

929
01:26:52,290 --> 01:26:53,541
Nothing at all.

930
01:26:54,666 --> 01:26:57,962
Nothing except take my family
and my girl in New York.

931
01:26:58,087 --> 01:27:00,548
- Lydia was never your girl!
- And my wife!

932
01:27:00,924 --> 01:27:02,592
And my daughter here.

933
01:27:04,135 --> 01:27:07,096
No, Joe Smith ain't done nothing to me.

934
01:27:08,556 --> 01:27:12,101
I heard about how Mrs. Steed ended up
with the Mormons.

935
01:27:13,186 --> 01:27:16,814
Pregnant and beaten.
Joe Smith do that?

936
01:27:17,941 --> 01:27:18,983
You watch your mouth.

937
01:27:19,108 --> 01:27:21,402
I saw the scars on her feet

938
01:27:21,486 --> 01:27:24,572
when her and her baby
were forced out of this county!

939
01:27:25,156 --> 01:27:27,742
- Old Joe do that, too?
- Yeah, I tried to warn her.

940
01:27:27,867 --> 01:27:30,411
You don't know! I tried!

941
01:27:32,914 --> 01:27:34,290
That's big of you.

942
01:27:35,666 --> 01:27:37,669
You know,
maybe Pa was right about you.

943
01:27:42,465 --> 01:27:43,675
Bobby!

944
01:27:44,968 --> 01:27:47,053
I held your daughter tonight.

945
01:27:49,097 --> 01:27:50,807
She's better off without you.

946
01:27:56,562 --> 01:27:58,106
I don't know this man.

947
01:28:00,692 --> 01:28:04,737
But you're right though.
He's a Mormon.

948
01:28:08,907 --> 01:28:10,034
Joshua!

949
01:28:13,454 --> 01:28:14,871
Joshua!

950
01:28:15,289 --> 01:28:17,959
- I want to see his face.
- Where's your prophet?

951
01:28:37,020 --> 01:28:41,273
Sorry if I caused you pain,
talking about what your son did.

952
01:28:47,905 --> 01:28:49,157
What about you?

953
01:28:50,532 --> 01:28:54,162
If he came back here tonight,
I'd want him to hold his little girl.

954
01:29:10,803 --> 01:29:13,514
I'm not real sure
that he's my son anymore.

955
01:29:16,225 --> 01:29:19,437
You call it what you want,
but he's your son

956
01:29:20,813 --> 01:29:22,023
and her daddy.

957
01:29:26,611 --> 01:29:30,656
- Did he ever talk about me?
- Maybe one time.

958
01:29:33,326 --> 01:29:37,371
The night I told him I was gonna have
a baby, he got real, real gentle like.

959
01:29:37,871 --> 01:29:40,541
Told me about
when his ma had his baby brother.

960
01:29:45,588 --> 01:29:46,839
It was Matthew.

961
01:29:52,512 --> 01:29:56,264
And he remembered how his ma used
to sing a song to that baby brother.

962
01:29:57,391 --> 01:29:59,393
Somebody used to sing it to him.

963
01:30:00,436 --> 01:30:03,648
He couldn't remember
if it was his ma or you that sung it.

964
01:30:05,983 --> 01:30:09,028
Something about
keeping the angels close

965
01:30:09,570 --> 01:30:12,824
and they'll keep you through the night.
Something like that.

966
01:30:15,118 --> 01:30:16,827
Must have been his mother.

967
01:30:21,666 --> 01:30:23,459
I'm gonna go get some water.

968
01:30:47,316 --> 01:30:50,653
Angels will hold thee

969
01:30:54,782 --> 01:30:57,826
Ben, you better come.

970
01:30:57,827 --> 01:30:59,245
It was my fault, my fault.

971
01:31:00,830 --> 01:31:02,456
Did Joshua do this?

972
01:31:06,585 --> 01:31:08,945
- Who did this to him?
- We don't even know who brought him.

973
01:31:11,257 --> 01:31:13,718
- Did Joshua do this?
- Ben, Ben, Ben.

974
01:31:13,800 --> 01:31:15,553
- Did Joshua do this?
- I don't know.

975
01:31:15,678 --> 01:31:17,346
Ben! Don't.

976
01:31:19,974 --> 01:31:23,936
- Ben, what are you doing?
- Papa Steed.

977
01:31:28,816 --> 01:31:30,276
Who did this to you?
