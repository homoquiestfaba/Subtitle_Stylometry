1
00:02:05,433 --> 00:02:07,765
Getyour tickets here,
ladies and gentlemen...

2
00:02:07,835 --> 00:02:10,360
for the most frightening show
you've ever seen in your life!

3
00:02:10,438 --> 00:02:12,372
Step right up!

4
00:02:14,375 --> 00:02:16,309
That one is closed right now, sir.

5
00:02:20,048 --> 00:02:21,481
This way, please.

6
00:02:30,958 --> 00:02:34,655
Ladies and gentlemen,
before we go on...

7
00:02:34,729 --> 00:02:35,821
I must ask...

8
00:02:35,897 --> 00:02:38,866
that anyone easily impressed...

9
00:02:38,933 --> 00:02:41,663
or suffering ofa weak heart,
leave the tent now.

10
00:02:43,237 --> 00:02:46,468
And the children too.
Madam, please, for shame.

11
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:56,741
Now, you have all heard bone-chilling
rumors ofthe walking dead.

12
00:02:57,652 --> 00:03:00,246
In the West Indies,
authorities are baffled...

13
00:03:00,321 --> 00:03:02,448
by gruesome crime sprees...

14
00:03:02,523 --> 00:03:06,960
committed by men
with the strength ofan army.

15
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:12,590
''Zombies,'' they call them!
Strange word, I know.

16
00:03:12,667 --> 00:03:17,127
Make no mistake,
the zombie is a savage soul...

17
00:03:17,205 --> 00:03:19,605
with no conscience.

18
00:03:19,674 --> 00:03:22,666
And ifprovoked, can and will...

19
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:27,681
rip the guts out ofeach and every
living being here tonight.

20
00:03:29,283 --> 00:03:31,717
You have been warned.

21
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:52,937
Remember me?
It's Angus, your friend.

22
00:03:53,007 --> 00:03:57,501
I've brought some nice people
who want to meetyou.

23
00:03:57,578 --> 00:04:00,069
There's no reason to be afraid.

24
00:04:03,584 --> 00:04:06,052
For God's sake,
he looks like my uncle Fergus.

25
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,351
- Please, sir, be quiet.
- You hear me? I demand me money back!

26
00:04:09,423 --> 00:04:12,153
Sir, for God's sake,
just get to the back ofthe tent.

27
00:04:12,226 --> 00:04:14,990
Be quiet. We will giveyou
your money back.

28
00:04:17,098 --> 00:04:19,931
What's wrong with you people? Can'tyou
seeyou're being played for fools?

29
00:04:20,001 --> 00:04:22,936
That's not a zombie.
It's some clown dressed up in rags.

30
00:04:25,506 --> 00:04:30,239
Get out ofhere, for God sakes!
Please be quiet!

31
00:04:31,879 --> 00:04:34,109
Please! No, I beg you!

32
00:04:34,182 --> 00:04:38,050
Please, please!
Please don't hurt me!

33
00:05:15,323 --> 00:05:17,120
He's in that tent over there!

34
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:33,037
Get 'em out ofhere.
Get 'em all out ofhere.

35
00:05:33,107 --> 00:05:35,200
Show's over.

36
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,433
It's clear.

37
00:06:01,335 --> 00:06:02,768
We're clear, Terry.

38
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:10,173
- Not bad.
- Not bad at all.

39
00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:13,611
Angus, Terry says I can't come out
for a drinkwith everybody.

40
00:06:13,681 --> 00:06:16,275
We've been
through this before, Bailey.

41
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:18,841
Zombies can't be seen
having a drink down at the local.

42
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,548
- Ruins the illusion.
- But it's our last night here.

43
00:06:21,622 --> 00:06:24,750
Doesn't matter. The gladiators didn't
suddenly nip out for a tortellini...

44
00:06:24,825 --> 00:06:27,259
after the lions torn 'em up, did they?

45
00:06:28,496 --> 00:06:30,088
Man, I strike the tents
every town we been in.

46
00:06:30,164 --> 00:06:32,689
It's high time somebody else
get stuckwith thejob.

47
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:34,701
Welcome to show business, kid.

48
00:06:47,848 --> 00:06:50,180
- Knock, knock, princess.
- How'd we do?

49
00:06:50,251 --> 00:06:53,186
Our best nightyet.
We're going out with a bang.

50
00:06:55,089 --> 00:06:59,082
You were terrific.
Butyou already know that.

51
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:04,996
Here is to the most beautiful creature
this planet has ever known...

52
00:07:05,066 --> 00:07:08,934
and the most accomplished performer
this sorry bunch ever laid eyes upon.

53
00:07:09,003 --> 00:07:10,265
Cheers.

54
00:07:10,338 --> 00:07:13,330
To the most charming charlatan
I've ever allowed under my skirt.

55
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:16,535
And to the Ringling Brothers
and their 40 railroad cars...

56
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:18,544
traveling all overAmerica.

57
00:07:18,612 --> 00:07:20,546
- Here we go.
- Bloody right.

58
00:07:29,557 --> 00:07:31,184
Sir?

59
00:07:31,258 --> 00:07:35,251
- You are no mermaid.
- Sir, you're not allowed--

60
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:39,698
You're no colossal beast
from the sea.

61
00:07:39,767 --> 00:07:42,565
That is true, sir,
I'm an actress.

62
00:07:42,636 --> 00:07:44,729
A liar!

63
00:07:44,805 --> 00:07:47,774
Well, that's one way oflooking at it.
Look, we intended no harm.

64
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:50,470
The show's over, sir.
You're not even allowed to be in here.

65
00:07:50,544 --> 00:07:53,445
- You are no mermaid.
- I thinkwe've established that, sir.

66
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:56,074
- Ifyou'djust kindly step outside.
- You're a fake.

67
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:59,085
Madam, you'rejust a fake.

68
00:08:08,562 --> 00:08:09,995
Sir?

69
00:08:15,002 --> 00:08:16,162
I'm sorry.

70
00:08:16,237 --> 00:08:19,798
I apologize.
I'm so sorry.

71
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,900
It's quite all right, sir.

72
00:08:23,644 --> 00:08:27,080
- Come on, sir.
- Good evening, sir. I'm so sorry.

73
00:08:28,582 --> 00:08:30,516
Can we offeryou a ride home, sir?

74
00:08:50,137 --> 00:08:53,732
Please be kind enough
to wait in the dining room.

75
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:38,675
I don't leave the house much
these days...

76
00:09:38,752 --> 00:09:41,880
not since mywife passed away.

77
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:46,052
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- Pleasejoin me for some ofthe best.

78
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:49,228
Certainly.

79
00:09:58,072 --> 00:09:59,835
Areyou married?

80
00:09:59,907 --> 00:10:01,340
Notyet.

81
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:06,712
Doyou live byyourself?

82
00:10:14,388 --> 00:10:17,118
I thought I heard you
talking to someone.

83
00:10:18,425 --> 00:10:22,361
I live by myself,
but not alone.

84
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:28,768
You're right to think me strange...

85
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:32,101
butyou'd be strange too...

86
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:34,141
ifyou knew what I know.

87
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:36,233
We don't thinkyou strange.

88
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:39,438
All water holds hidden magic.

89
00:10:39,513 --> 00:10:42,744
Without it
there can be no life on Earth.

90
00:10:42,816 --> 00:10:47,253
But what I am telling you
is not magic.

91
00:10:52,359 --> 00:10:53,621
You understand?

92
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:57,528
Absolutely. And yet,
at the risk ofsounding--

93
00:10:57,598 --> 00:10:59,930
For thousands ofyears...

94
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,994
men have believed in an enclave
ofislands...

95
00:11:05,072 --> 00:11:09,202
known as the Forbidden Islands...

96
00:11:09,276 --> 00:11:12,370
where mermaids breed.

97
00:11:14,348 --> 00:11:19,285
In Greek mythology,
sirens were originally bird women.

98
00:11:19,353 --> 00:11:24,723
Then, somewhere along the line
they mutated into fish women.

99
00:11:24,792 --> 00:11:28,091
But like I said,
that is Greek mythology.

100
00:11:30,197 --> 00:11:33,633
Mermaids are myths.

101
00:11:33,701 --> 00:11:37,137
Everybody knows that.

102
00:11:37,204 --> 00:11:41,300
They sing, they dance...

103
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:46,176
they lure the sailors to their lair
with their pale flesh.

104
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:50,809
And the story goes
that everyyear...

105
00:11:50,884 --> 00:11:53,114
under the strongest
ofthe full moon...

106
00:11:53,187 --> 00:11:55,985
usually in summer...

107
00:11:56,056 --> 00:12:00,686
the mermaid becomes human
for roughly one night.

108
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:04,288
That's right. Human.

109
00:12:05,132 --> 00:12:08,158
Legs, feet and all.

110
00:12:09,069 --> 00:12:11,503
Quaint little maidens.

111
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:15,104
Virginal...

112
00:12:15,175 --> 00:12:17,109
innocent...

113
00:12:18,178 --> 00:12:20,612
meek as sin.

114
00:12:23,384 --> 00:12:28,583
Now, who would believe
an extraordinary story like that?

115
00:12:28,656 --> 00:12:31,056
This one has a rather unfortunate
skin condition.

116
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:34,652
That is the Queen ofthe Lair.

117
00:12:34,728 --> 00:12:37,993
Different cultures have
different names for her--

118
00:12:38,065 --> 00:12:42,092
Moreski, Rudi,
Coralia, Sihrena.

119
00:12:42,169 --> 00:12:47,266
But they all share
one thing in common.

120
00:12:47,341 --> 00:12:53,246
They all say her name
in hushed tones.

121
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:56,477
She has powers
the others don't.

122
00:12:56,550 --> 00:13:00,543
Certain pagan religions
esteem her...

123
00:13:00,621 --> 00:13:03,522
the highest offertility symbols.

124
00:13:09,096 --> 00:13:10,529
You must go.

125
00:13:10,597 --> 00:13:14,727
- Well, you know, it'sjust--
- Yes, I understand. I wasn't always...

126
00:13:14,802 --> 00:13:16,861
old and incoherent.

127
00:13:16,937 --> 00:13:19,633
- Thankyou for bringing me home.
- Our pleasure.

128
00:13:19,707 --> 00:13:21,072
Certainly.

129
00:13:24,044 --> 00:13:26,274
You didn't believe a word,
did you?

130
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:28,474
Oh, sure we did, everything.

131
00:13:28,549 --> 00:13:31,450
It'sjust that we'll be traveling soon,
and we need our rest.

132
00:13:31,518 --> 00:13:33,952
I came toyour show tonight
because I believed...

133
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:37,548
thatyou'd captured a real one,
and I wanted to warn you ofthe danger.

134
00:13:38,459 --> 00:13:43,396
Like we explained, it's an illusion.
You know, entertainment.

135
00:13:47,234 --> 00:13:49,099
I believeyou, sir.

136
00:13:52,473 --> 00:13:54,441
Come with me. Come.

137
00:13:56,477 --> 00:13:58,570
Now we're never getting out ofhere.

138
00:14:19,433 --> 00:14:21,526
That is fantastic.

139
00:14:23,604 --> 00:14:25,538
She looks so real.

140
00:14:27,374 --> 00:14:30,104
That is remarkable.

141
00:14:30,177 --> 00:14:32,771
Has she been underwater
the whole time we've been here?

142
00:14:32,846 --> 00:14:37,146
How does she make it
so her skin doesn't get all wrinkled?

143
00:14:37,217 --> 00:14:38,809
Don't get close.

144
00:14:40,521 --> 00:14:42,648
Is it a see-through breathing tube?
Is it a straw?

145
00:14:42,723 --> 00:14:45,157
How does she do it?

146
00:14:47,895 --> 00:14:49,328
She's not used to strangers.

147
00:14:52,065 --> 00:14:53,623
She's very ill.

148
00:14:55,569 --> 00:14:58,732
- Why the chains?
- She's broken the glass repeatedly.

149
00:14:58,806 --> 00:15:00,831
I had to build the cage around her.

150
00:15:00,908 --> 00:15:04,867
Oh, stop it. Go on.
Tell me how it's done.

151
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:07,508
Go on, I beg you.

152
00:15:08,649 --> 00:15:11,584
She murdered mywife.

153
00:15:12,653 --> 00:15:15,747
That's all I see when I look at her,
and she knows it.

154
00:15:41,181 --> 00:15:43,615
It is a goddamn mermaid, isn't it?

155
00:15:45,219 --> 00:15:48,279
You'd love to show her
as a freak attraction.

156
00:15:48,355 --> 00:15:51,882
- Is that whatyou're thinking, sir?
- No, ofcourse not.

157
00:15:52,793 --> 00:15:57,059
But we could deliver her to a scientific
institution where she might be studied.

158
00:15:57,130 --> 00:16:00,759
It seems a shame to deprive
the modern world ofthe insights--

159
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:03,530
The answer is no.

160
00:16:03,604 --> 00:16:05,071
Perhaps sleep on it?

161
00:16:05,138 --> 00:16:10,235
I'm not much ofa sleeper, sir.
Not anymore.

162
00:16:17,251 --> 00:16:19,549
You'll driveyourselfmad, darling.

163
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:22,987
- Perhaps it's meant to be.
- Nah, how could it be?

164
00:16:23,056 --> 00:16:27,015
All my life I've been concocting
extraordinary schemes to dazzle a crowd.

165
00:16:27,094 --> 00:16:31,053
I have never come across the real McCoy.
No one I've heard ofever does.

166
00:16:31,131 --> 00:16:33,122
Oh, brother, here come superlatives.

167
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,691
The ''nevers'' and the ''evers''
and the ''chance ofa lifetimes.''

168
00:16:35,769 --> 00:16:38,966
You could forget the Ringling Brothers.
Go straight to Madison Square Garden.

169
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:42,497
Present the world with
the greatest find ofthe century.

170
00:16:42,576 --> 00:16:46,376
Have a little faith.
The century'sjust begun.

171
00:16:46,446 --> 00:16:51,884
Besides, I thought I was the star
mermaid ofthis show.

172
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,553
Am I not?

173
00:16:55,756 --> 00:16:58,350
Yeah, sureyou are, darling.

174
00:17:03,263 --> 00:17:04,696
Come on.

175
00:17:27,187 --> 00:17:30,679
- Has Bailey gone to bed already?
- Yes, sir.

176
00:17:30,757 --> 00:17:33,658
- But not alone.
- What doyou mean?

177
00:17:33,727 --> 00:17:37,185
-The Siamese trapeze twins are in there.
-Both ofthem?

178
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:41,132
Being the star ofthe show
has its perks.

179
00:17:41,201 --> 00:17:43,965
- Welcome to show business, kid.
- Well, go wake him up.

180
00:17:44,037 --> 00:17:46,528
Tell him he'll be back in action
in 1 5 minutes.

181
00:18:41,128 --> 00:18:43,289
I warned you--
I'm not much ofa sleeper.

182
00:18:43,363 --> 00:18:48,062
Captain Woolrich, ifyoujust allow me
to explain my proposal.

183
00:18:48,135 --> 00:18:50,899
I'm sure it's very civilized.

184
00:18:50,971 --> 00:18:54,532
I loan you the creature...

185
00:18:54,608 --> 00:18:58,738
and then you make a name foryourself
in the world...

186
00:18:58,812 --> 00:19:01,110
and share the profits with me.

187
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:04,412
Butyou skipped the part
where the creature...

188
00:19:04,484 --> 00:19:07,009
bites the hand that feeds it...

189
00:19:07,087 --> 00:19:11,319
and you end up a paranoid old fool...

190
00:19:11,391 --> 00:19:15,293
staring at her day and night,
and night and day and day and night.

191
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:17,421
That's perceptive ofyou, but--

192
00:19:17,497 --> 00:19:20,125
Shut up.

193
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,226
The creature will not leave
this house.

194
00:19:23,303 --> 00:19:25,396
God knows...

195
00:19:25,472 --> 00:19:29,408
I've earned the privilege
to see her die.

196
00:19:35,082 --> 00:19:38,017
Why not put the weapon down, Captain?

197
00:19:39,052 --> 00:19:40,314
You have no right.

198
00:19:40,387 --> 00:19:43,083
-Just calm down now, sir.
- You've no right.

199
00:19:53,834 --> 00:19:55,961
My pills.

200
00:20:00,907 --> 00:20:03,876
Get out ofmy house!

201
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:07,171
I said calm down.

202
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:10,683
Jesus Christ, Bailey,
I thinkyou killed him.

203
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:12,184
Sir!

204
00:20:12,986 --> 00:20:15,386
Oh, no, please don't, sir!

205
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:22,323
Oh, God, I'm going to hell.

206
00:20:22,395 --> 00:20:25,728
Fifteen minutes ago I was in bed
with the twins. Now I'm going to hell.

207
00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:27,926
Nobody is going tojail!
Understand? Nobody.

208
00:20:28,001 --> 00:20:29,969
Hell, I said.
I'm going to hell.

209
00:20:30,036 --> 00:20:32,834
I can't helpyou there.
First things first.

210
00:20:32,906 --> 00:20:35,739
He never left the house. He has
supplies brought in once a week.

211
00:20:35,809 --> 00:20:37,743
It'll be weeks
before anyone finds him.

212
00:20:37,811 --> 00:20:39,870
I did the most horrible thing
a person can do.

213
00:20:39,946 --> 00:20:43,814
It was an accident!
We all saw it, it was self-defense.

214
00:20:43,884 --> 00:20:45,476
Sir!

215
00:21:06,006 --> 00:21:07,769
- You sure she won't wake up?
- Positive.

216
00:21:07,841 --> 00:21:11,436
That's enough to put down
two adult elephants.

217
00:21:12,879 --> 00:21:15,439
- What about the tank?
- We'll have to empty it to move it.

218
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,553
What's in the book?

219
00:21:21,621 --> 00:21:25,057
The old man's wife wrote down
her observations on the creature.

220
00:21:26,193 --> 00:21:28,127
Come on, let's get outta here.

221
00:21:29,229 --> 00:21:31,163
All right, take her up!

222
00:21:36,803 --> 00:21:41,240
All right, then. Where's your
Mr. Shaw and the last passenger?

223
00:21:41,308 --> 00:21:44,300
- They'll be here momentarily.
- Better be. We're leaving soon.

224
00:21:44,377 --> 00:21:46,902
All hands prepare to get underway!

225
00:21:50,383 --> 00:21:54,285
- Haveyou gone completely mad?
-Jesus Christ, Lily, what's in here?

226
00:21:54,354 --> 00:21:56,982
My costumes. You sneak out
in the middle ofthe night...

227
00:21:57,057 --> 00:21:58,991
to purchase a creature we don't know
the first thing about.

228
00:21:59,059 --> 00:22:01,892
Scratch that. We do know something.
She murdered the old Captain's wife.

229
00:22:01,962 --> 00:22:04,453
He said that at first,
but he changed his story around.

230
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:06,465
He's an old drunk, you know?

231
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:08,728
But the rest ofthe troupe,
we can'tjust leave them behind.

232
00:22:08,802 --> 00:22:11,236
They'll bejoining us in two weeks
as planned.

233
00:22:11,304 --> 00:22:13,636
This is wrong, Angus.
This whole idea.

234
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:15,231
What about it is wrong?

235
00:22:15,308 --> 00:22:18,175
To have that thing in a tank,
for starters, is wrong.

236
00:22:20,046 --> 00:22:23,140
I'll tell you what's wrong.
What is wrong is me and you...

237
00:22:23,216 --> 00:22:26,208
stuck in some small town,
barely surviving on scraps.

238
00:22:26,286 --> 00:22:28,982
Me up there like a monkey
trying to lure poor idiots...

239
00:22:29,055 --> 00:22:30,716
into falling for smoke and mirrors...

240
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:33,156
whilstyou batyour eyelashes
and stickyour chest out.

241
00:22:33,226 --> 00:22:34,750
That's what's wrong.

242
00:22:38,064 --> 00:22:42,660
Ifyou think Ringling Brothers give
a hoot about our quaint little act...

243
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:46,263
just because we have charming
personalities and elocution--

244
00:22:46,339 --> 00:22:47,772
It doesn't work that way.

245
00:22:47,841 --> 00:22:51,277
This life, you see a chance,
you take it.

246
00:22:53,046 --> 00:22:56,948
Yes, sir, you need something
to makeyou stick out from the crowd.

247
00:22:57,017 --> 00:23:00,612
And for God sakes,
a real life bleedin' mermaid.

248
00:23:00,687 --> 00:23:03,554
Something no one's ever seen before.
This is history...

249
00:23:03,623 --> 00:23:06,114
and archaeology and spectacle
all rolled into one.

250
00:23:06,192 --> 00:23:08,888
This is our ticket, Lily.

251
00:23:08,962 --> 00:23:10,930
I have a bad feeling
about this, Angus.

252
00:23:10,997 --> 00:23:13,830
Mixed feelings are good.
Keeps you balanced.

253
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:16,334
I didn't say mixed.
I said bad.

254
00:24:48,561 --> 00:24:52,998
Well, there must be something
you like to eat then, isn't there?

255
00:24:56,469 --> 00:24:58,903
You and me both, lady.

256
00:25:02,609 --> 00:25:06,045
I can't understand a word
you're saying, so why even try?

257
00:25:09,816 --> 00:25:12,580
Let's keep it quiet now, shall we?
Potato?

258
00:25:17,023 --> 00:25:18,957
What is it?

259
00:25:20,193 --> 00:25:23,492
A curious somebody, huh?
Is that it?

260
00:25:23,563 --> 00:25:25,497
I'll go check.

261
00:25:28,201 --> 00:25:30,135
Please,just relax.
Calm down.

262
00:25:33,773 --> 00:25:35,707
- Was thatyoujust now?
- What?

263
00:25:35,775 --> 00:25:37,709
You wanna come in?

264
00:25:40,613 --> 00:25:43,548
You keep quiet now, all right?
You're gonna get us all in trouble.

265
00:25:45,652 --> 00:25:47,586
Come inside, now.

266
00:25:50,857 --> 00:25:52,290
Thank God.

267
00:26:30,563 --> 00:26:33,031
Methinks she likeyou better
than me.

268
00:26:38,638 --> 00:26:41,198
Angus tells meyou're a famous artist
ofthe stage, Miss Lily.

269
00:26:41,274 --> 00:26:44,801
- One ofthese actresses.
- Angus tends to exaggerate.

270
00:26:44,878 --> 00:26:48,109
It's part ofthejob description,
but not in this case.

271
00:26:48,181 --> 00:26:51,548
Fascinating life, I'd imagine,
the life on the stage.

272
00:26:51,618 --> 00:26:55,384
Me, I never understood how anybody
could remember all those words...

273
00:26:55,455 --> 00:26:58,322
all at once, night after night, eh?

274
00:26:58,391 --> 00:27:01,326
- Is it all it's cracked up to be?
- Sorry. Excuse me.

275
00:27:05,131 --> 00:27:08,897
- She's not used to the motion.
- That's the problem with most women.

276
00:27:08,968 --> 00:27:11,459
Either that, or she's with child.

277
00:27:12,805 --> 00:27:15,273
- Not Lily.
- I notice the African fellow...

278
00:27:15,341 --> 00:27:17,605
spends a lot oftime
in the cargo compartment.

279
00:27:17,677 --> 00:27:19,611
I'm not opposed to him mingling.

280
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:22,546
Thanks, I'll let him know that.
Just a bit shy.

281
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:27,251
Hey, Miles, thought I asked you
to fix that rigging yesterday.

282
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:29,254
Yes, sir, you did.

283
00:27:32,926 --> 00:27:36,020
- I broughtyou a little something.
- Thankyou.

284
00:27:37,697 --> 00:27:40,427
At least someone's looking healthier.

285
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:44,095
I don't know why.
She hasn't touched food since we left.

286
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:47,071
Well, it could be the ocean air.

287
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:49,233
Her skin is much better.

288
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:54,468
Doyou want me to take over
for a bit?

289
00:27:54,547 --> 00:27:57,345
I could use a bit ofa stretch.

290
00:27:57,417 --> 00:28:00,011
- Gifford is gonna be back in a bit.
- All right.

291
00:28:06,259 --> 00:28:09,194
Good morning.
How areyou today?

292
00:28:11,731 --> 00:28:14,791
We're gonna have to nameyou
something, you know.

293
00:28:14,867 --> 00:28:16,960
We all need a name.

294
00:28:20,506 --> 00:28:22,667
Not much ofa talker, though.

295
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:26,071
That's all right.

296
00:28:26,145 --> 00:28:29,478
What's important is
thatyou're feeling better.

297
00:28:29,549 --> 00:28:30,982
Aren'tyou?

298
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:37,784
What areyou thinking, I wonder?
What doyou make ofall this?

299
00:28:40,927 --> 00:28:43,953
Oh, God, that was you.

300
00:28:46,366 --> 00:28:50,462
You caught me by surprise.
You're moving much quicker.

301
00:29:02,849 --> 00:29:05,750
Well, that's veryinteresting,
says I, becausehe'sa dunce.

302
00:29:05,818 --> 00:29:07,752
Never reached the second book.

303
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:16,394
I'll be with you in a minute, darling.

304
00:29:16,462 --> 00:29:18,259
Did I tell you
about the hangman and the hawk?

305
00:29:20,733 --> 00:29:23,827
Bedtime, is it, Miss Lillian?

306
00:29:23,903 --> 00:29:25,336
Yes.

307
00:29:28,474 --> 00:29:30,066
No, thankyou.

308
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:32,577
Suityourself. More for me.

309
00:29:34,881 --> 00:29:39,443
I'm sorry, that wasn't very
gentlemanlike ofme, was it?

310
00:29:41,254 --> 00:29:45,054
It's hard sometimes.
We're not used to traveling with dames.

311
00:29:45,124 --> 00:29:47,649
- I understand.
- Must be awful foryou...

312
00:29:47,727 --> 00:29:50,525
listening to all this sailor talk
day and night...

313
00:29:50,596 --> 00:29:54,532
so crass and profane, isn't it?

314
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,534
It doesn't bother me.

315
00:29:56,602 --> 00:30:01,630
You are a politeyoung lady,
ifI may.

316
00:30:01,708 --> 00:30:05,144
I once knew a young lady
in London.

317
00:30:06,245 --> 00:30:12,115
I hesitate to call her a lady,
but she certainlywas feminine.

318
00:30:12,185 --> 00:30:15,018
Not refined, such as yourself,
ofcourse...

319
00:30:15,088 --> 00:30:19,616
but she was-- oh, God--
rather, what's the proper term--

320
00:30:21,127 --> 00:30:23,186
a resourceful girl.

321
00:30:23,262 --> 00:30:25,753
Charming, full oflife.

322
00:30:25,832 --> 00:30:30,269
Wouldn't be accurate to call her
an easywoman, 'cause easy she wasn't.

323
00:30:32,972 --> 00:30:35,736
MaryAnn, that was her name.

324
00:30:35,808 --> 00:30:37,799
MaryAnn was barren...

325
00:30:37,877 --> 00:30:40,471
which made her chosen profession
all the easier.

326
00:30:40,546 --> 00:30:45,381
She had a sad tale ofwoe
regarding her condition.

327
00:30:45,451 --> 00:30:49,751
Backroom operationjust off
the London port. Sad stuff.

328
00:30:49,822 --> 00:30:52,689
We spent a whole month together.

329
00:30:52,759 --> 00:30:55,319
She stole my heart...

330
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:58,626
which wouldn't have been so bad
ifshe hadn't stolen all my money.

331
00:30:59,699 --> 00:31:02,827
Now, mind you, and I'm not
too embarrassed to admit it...

332
00:31:02,902 --> 00:31:06,133
mind you,
she had charged me handsomely...

333
00:31:06,205 --> 00:31:09,140
for the pleasure ofher acquaintance,
and even so...

334
00:31:09,208 --> 00:31:13,542
I wake up one morning,
and she's gone with everything I own.

335
00:31:13,613 --> 00:31:15,547
Can you believe that?

336
00:31:16,616 --> 00:31:19,483
- That's awful.
- What'd you say?

337
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:23,488
I said, that's awful--
your tale ofmisfortune.

338
00:31:25,691 --> 00:31:28,125
Quite awful.

339
00:31:29,462 --> 00:31:32,397
The ''awfulest.''

340
00:31:32,465 --> 00:31:36,060
Didn't make me feel any better
to find out...

341
00:31:36,135 --> 00:31:40,071
that she had done this
to a dozen sailors before me.

342
00:31:41,808 --> 00:31:45,642
Like I said, MaryAnn was
a very resourceful girl...

343
00:31:45,711 --> 00:31:49,147
not a lady such as yourself.

344
00:31:55,388 --> 00:31:58,482
What have we here, Miss Lillian?

345
00:31:59,592 --> 00:32:03,653
Seems likeyou have
a loose thread.

346
00:32:03,729 --> 00:32:06,596
I'll find it later, thankyou.

347
00:32:06,666 --> 00:32:09,999
I hope I didn't scareyou...

348
00:32:10,069 --> 00:32:13,505
butyou don't strike me
as the type to scare easily.

349
00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:18,905
I must go now.

350
00:32:20,913 --> 00:32:24,178
She had the sweetest mole-- MaryAnn--

351
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:26,844
right between her breasts.

352
00:32:29,555 --> 00:32:32,490
I'm sure she did.
Good night, sir.

353
00:34:29,175 --> 00:34:31,200
Not Angus.

354
00:34:31,277 --> 00:34:33,336
Miles.
I said Miles.

355
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:09,912
Angus, wake up.
Wake up, man, wake up!

356
00:35:12,885 --> 00:35:14,853
They found her.

357
00:35:16,722 --> 00:35:19,555
I'm telling you, don't be fooled
bywhat it appears to be.

358
00:35:19,625 --> 00:35:22,025
It's a curse on the boat.

359
00:35:22,094 --> 00:35:25,791
Pure evil.
We're better offto kill it now.

360
00:35:25,865 --> 00:35:27,958
It's all right, it's all right.

361
00:35:28,034 --> 00:35:30,559
- You knew about this?
- Yes, sir, I can explain.

362
00:35:30,636 --> 00:35:33,127
I don't think any explanation
could satisfy.

363
00:35:34,106 --> 00:35:36,472
Give me one good reason
why I shouldn't throw this thing...

364
00:35:36,542 --> 00:35:39,477
offmy ship right now
and you with it!

365
00:35:39,545 --> 00:35:42,036
Ifyoujust let my men get her back down
into her tank, and you and I can talk.

366
00:35:43,115 --> 00:35:46,482
I've had men flogged to death
for less.

367
00:35:46,552 --> 00:35:49,544
Give me one good reason, Mr. Shaw.

368
00:35:51,757 --> 00:35:54,282
I'll giveyou more good reasons
than you could ever imagine.

369
00:35:59,231 --> 00:36:01,165
Go on, get rid ofher.

370
00:36:02,168 --> 00:36:04,295
Miles, come with me.

371
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:07,100
-He's not here, Captain.
-Find him, tell him to come to my cabin.

372
00:36:09,942 --> 00:36:11,876
It's as ifshe's drunk.

373
00:36:18,884 --> 00:36:22,911
Think ofit as the greatest treasure
any man has ever discovered.

374
00:36:22,988 --> 00:36:24,922
What about my crew?

375
00:36:29,428 --> 00:36:31,362
This is an advance.
More to come later.

376
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:33,330
You divideyour share
anywhich wayyou see fair.

377
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:36,095
I think I'm being
more than generous here.

378
00:36:37,703 --> 00:36:39,432
Yes.

379
00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:42,666
Can't find Miles, sir.
He must be down below.

380
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:45,305
Let him sleep it off.
Thanks, Skelly.

381
00:36:49,348 --> 00:36:52,875
What about their safety?
I have a responsibility.

382
00:36:52,952 --> 00:36:55,284
So we'll be careful.

383
00:36:55,354 --> 00:36:57,288
Putyourselfin my shoes.
What would you have done?

384
00:36:57,356 --> 00:37:00,223
I had no way ofknowing
you'd even accept the cargo.

385
00:37:00,292 --> 00:37:02,487
But believe me when I tell you,
Captain...

386
00:37:02,561 --> 00:37:04,495
you're looking at a good luck charm
ofa lifetime.

387
00:37:04,563 --> 00:37:07,054
This is not an opportunity
you want to throw away.

388
00:37:25,417 --> 00:37:26,850
Excuse me.

389
00:37:29,922 --> 00:37:31,048
What happened?

390
00:37:31,123 --> 00:37:33,523
She almost made it to the railing,
and then shejust dropped.

391
00:37:33,592 --> 00:37:35,753
Come on, now, everybody.

392
00:37:35,828 --> 00:37:37,887
On three, fellas, three!

393
00:37:37,963 --> 00:37:39,897
One, two, three.

394
00:37:39,965 --> 00:37:42,991
Yes, she's heavy.
Get her in here.

395
00:37:43,068 --> 00:37:45,502
Yes, one, two, three.

396
00:37:52,111 --> 00:37:57,014
All right, fellas, thankyou,
show's over. Let's get some sleep now.

397
00:37:57,082 --> 00:38:00,449
Very sorry about that, fellas.
We made a mistake, no harm done.

398
00:38:00,519 --> 00:38:02,646
She won't escape again.

399
00:38:05,024 --> 00:38:07,458
I'm going up for some fresh air.
It reeks in here.

400
00:39:36,382 --> 00:39:38,475
That was--

401
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:41,542
- You were quite forceful, darling.
- Sorry.

402
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:43,713
No, I like it.

403
00:39:43,789 --> 00:39:46,724
Perhaps the ocean air
is bringing out the animal in you.

404
00:39:52,531 --> 00:39:54,863
Look, Angus, we have to talk.

405
00:39:54,934 --> 00:39:58,199
You know I hate conversations
that start with, ''Look, Angus.''

406
00:39:58,270 --> 00:40:00,329
It's about me.

407
00:40:00,406 --> 00:40:03,432
Then I am interested.
As long as it's not about me.

408
00:40:03,509 --> 00:40:06,034
I'm bored to the hilt with me.

409
00:40:06,111 --> 00:40:11,981
My past is quite different
than what I've told you.

410
00:40:15,054 --> 00:40:16,988
For one, I was never
a famous actress in London.

411
00:40:17,056 --> 00:40:21,857
And I was never a champion swimmer.
In fact, I can't even swim.

412
00:40:21,927 --> 00:40:24,896
I wasn't on holidaywhen you and I met.
I was running away.

413
00:40:27,199 --> 00:40:29,133
There were men.

414
00:40:31,103 --> 00:40:36,541
There were several men
with whom I became acquainted.

415
00:40:38,744 --> 00:40:40,006
You understand?

416
00:40:42,648 --> 00:40:46,584
I don't care whatyou were
orwhatyou did beforeyou met me.

417
00:40:48,153 --> 00:40:49,745
I'm in love with the woman
you are now.

418
00:40:51,357 --> 00:40:54,451
The fact is,
I'm no saint meself.

419
00:41:02,935 --> 00:41:04,869
But that's not all.

420
00:41:07,373 --> 00:41:09,637
Miles was one ofthe men
I knew back in London.

421
00:41:11,143 --> 00:41:12,906
The Yankee sailor boy?

422
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:15,945
That Miles.

423
00:41:17,516 --> 00:41:20,747
No, I didn't steal it.

424
00:41:20,819 --> 00:41:24,812
Look, I had a nasty conversation
last night and he was cross with me.

425
00:41:25,557 --> 00:41:27,320
Why didn'tyou tell me?

426
00:41:27,393 --> 00:41:30,829
Ifthis character has any claim on you,
I will straighten him out.

427
00:41:30,896 --> 00:41:32,989
- You can't.
- Oh, yes, I can.

428
00:41:33,065 --> 00:41:36,933
He may be a big fella, but he'll be
hungover. I'll have the upper hand.

429
00:41:37,002 --> 00:41:40,597
That'sjust it.
You won't find him. He's dead.

430
00:41:43,475 --> 00:41:47,571
- What doyou mean?
- I think she ate him.

431
00:41:51,717 --> 00:41:54,550
- Who ate him?
- The mermaid!

432
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:57,088
She did it as a favor to me, see.

433
00:41:57,823 --> 00:41:59,450
Miles was drunk as a skunk...

434
00:41:59,525 --> 00:42:01,755
and that's why she became intoxicated
and couldn't escape.

435
00:42:01,827 --> 00:42:04,762
- I thinkyou might be running a fever.
- No, listen to me.

436
00:42:04,830 --> 00:42:06,923
I know how it sounds,
but I really believe...

437
00:42:06,999 --> 00:42:10,935
that she can read my thoughts,
and she did this for me.

438
00:42:11,003 --> 00:42:15,963
Listen toyourself. A mind-reading
mermaid who avenges women with a past.

439
00:42:16,041 --> 00:42:19,033
It sounds like something
we'd cook up together for the show.

440
00:42:22,448 --> 00:42:25,212
I'll seeyou at breakfast.

441
00:42:27,186 --> 00:42:29,279
But we have to set her free.

442
00:42:32,224 --> 00:42:35,682
Look, Lily,
I know all about guilt.

443
00:42:35,761 --> 00:42:38,025
I've been trying to outwit it
my entire life...

444
00:42:38,097 --> 00:42:41,897
and there isn't a chance in hell that
we're gonna set free that creature...

445
00:42:41,967 --> 00:42:45,403
just because ofsome nonsense psychic
poweryou think she's got overyou.

446
00:42:45,471 --> 00:42:47,405
Are we clear?

447
00:43:37,856 --> 00:43:41,792
''I'm not ajournal writer.
I am just scared.

448
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:45,694
My name is Teresa Woolrich.
Theyear is 1 904.

449
00:43:45,764 --> 00:43:48,562
ChristopherColumbus issaidtohave
seen threehideoussirens...

450
00:43:48,634 --> 00:43:51,330
playing in the water
nearSanto Domingo.

451
00:43:51,403 --> 00:43:53,462
In 1614, the English captain,
JohnSmith...

452
00:43:53,539 --> 00:43:56,975
saw whathe thought wasa woman
swimmingnearthe New World.

453
00:43:57,042 --> 00:43:58,805
Theman from theStracke Museum
came today.

454
00:43:58,877 --> 00:44:00,970
Hehadneverheardofa creature
like this lasting longer...

455
00:44:01,046 --> 00:44:02,809
than three weeks in captivity.

456
00:44:02,881 --> 00:44:04,906
Why is this one different?

457
00:44:04,983 --> 00:44:09,147
He wanted to take her backwith him.
We argued, all three ofus.

458
00:44:09,221 --> 00:44:14,022
Sherefusedto eat thepartofhis
stomach thathaddigestedfoodinit.

459
00:44:14,092 --> 00:44:16,526
As before, she refuses
to eat cooked foods.

460
00:44:16,595 --> 00:44:19,564
We cannot trusteitherone
tobealone withher.

461
00:44:19,631 --> 00:44:23,624
WhenheaskedmeifIsawher
in mysleep, Iliedagain.

462
00:44:23,702 --> 00:44:27,263
I cannot tell him
what I see in my dreams.

463
00:44:27,339 --> 00:44:29,637
I do not believe
that they are dreams.''

464
00:44:41,086 --> 00:44:43,077
Howyou doing, sweets?

465
00:44:43,155 --> 00:44:44,986
Oh, I have a problem.

466
00:44:45,057 --> 00:44:47,992
Anything I can helpyou with?

467
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:51,496
I don't suppose so.
It's about Captain Woolrich.

468
00:44:51,563 --> 00:44:55,055
- Somethingjust doesn't add up.
- About what?

469
00:44:55,133 --> 00:44:57,727
Did anything funny happen that night?

470
00:44:57,803 --> 00:45:00,966
Nothing funny at all,
just business talk.

471
00:45:02,808 --> 00:45:04,742
Thanks, Bailey.

472
00:45:04,810 --> 00:45:06,971
You're welcome.

473
00:45:07,045 --> 00:45:10,276
Forwhat? What did I do?

474
00:45:12,050 --> 00:45:14,109
You reveal when you lie.

475
00:45:14,186 --> 00:45:16,620
- The right side ofyour lip goes up.
- I wasjust chewing.

476
00:45:16,688 --> 00:45:19,156
I know. Bon appétit.

477
00:45:23,962 --> 00:45:26,192
- You all right?
- Yes.

478
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:31,233
Some sort ofcramp, I guess.

479
00:45:32,738 --> 00:45:34,706
Hereyou go.

480
00:45:44,716 --> 00:45:46,650
You're a son ofa bitch, Angus.

481
00:45:47,552 --> 00:45:49,486
You're in a swell mood.

482
00:45:50,956 --> 00:45:53,186
Did you read this?

483
00:45:53,258 --> 00:45:55,658
Is that what's upsetting you?
What'reyou looking in that for?

484
00:45:55,727 --> 00:45:57,991
Did you read it?

485
00:45:59,931 --> 00:46:02,832
I leafed through it. Sure.

486
00:46:02,901 --> 00:46:05,995
You leafed through it?
You leafed through...

487
00:46:06,071 --> 00:46:09,472
''I know she's taken ahold ofhim
completely and knows my every thought.

488
00:46:09,541 --> 00:46:14,410
Sometimes she answers when I have not
spoken out loud, so I am trapped.

489
00:46:14,479 --> 00:46:16,845
I cannot kill her
because she knows it's coming.''

490
00:46:16,915 --> 00:46:18,849
You read that, the very last entry?

491
00:46:18,917 --> 00:46:22,683
Not that part. It'sjust
the crazy ramblings ofhis wife.

492
00:46:22,754 --> 00:46:25,188
She sounds completely sane to me.

493
00:46:25,257 --> 00:46:29,785
She sounds like someone who meticulously
recorded her descent into despair.

494
00:46:29,861 --> 00:46:33,262
-She gives facts, dates.
-What ofit? Her husband was crazy too.

495
00:46:33,332 --> 00:46:36,665
''Was,'' you said?
Her husband was crazy?

496
00:46:36,735 --> 00:46:40,535
Is crazy. Her husband is crazy.

497
00:46:40,605 --> 00:46:43,506
Why don'tyoujust interrogate me?

498
00:46:44,576 --> 00:46:47,340
-What happened that night with Woolrich?
-I already told you.

499
00:46:47,412 --> 00:46:50,779
He gave us his blessing.
He gave us the book...

500
00:46:50,849 --> 00:46:53,545
for reference purposes.

501
00:46:53,618 --> 00:46:56,883
He didn't giveyou this book,
no matter how crazy he was.

502
00:46:56,955 --> 00:47:00,186
You been talking to Bailey?
I didn't wantyou to worry--

503
00:47:00,258 --> 00:47:03,352
Bailey said nothing.
Woolrich didn't giveyou this book...

504
00:47:03,428 --> 00:47:05,362
because his wife admits right here...

505
00:47:05,430 --> 00:47:08,524
that they murdered two people
to feed the creature.

506
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:12,730
Not to mention it's clear
that she herselfwound up as dinner.

507
00:47:12,804 --> 00:47:17,241
Nobody's crazy enough to hand over
three murder confessionsjust like that.

508
00:47:31,623 --> 00:47:33,682
It was an accident.

509
00:47:35,327 --> 00:47:37,887
Bailey pushed him too hard.

510
00:47:40,265 --> 00:47:44,167
The creature ate Miles.
You know it.

511
00:47:44,236 --> 00:47:46,796
Let me hearyou say it.
Please don't treat me like I'm crazy.

512
00:47:50,675 --> 00:47:52,643
Yeah, you're probably right.

513
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:59,548
And you'rejust going to ignore that
it's only time before she kills again?

514
00:47:59,618 --> 00:48:01,586
This is what she does.
It's her nature.

515
00:48:01,653 --> 00:48:03,587
I don't see the point
in getting everyone hysterical.

516
00:48:05,323 --> 00:48:07,723
They already mourned Miles.
They said it was an accident.

517
00:48:07,793 --> 00:48:10,159
Now all you have to do
is keep away from the tank.

518
00:48:10,228 --> 00:48:12,196
- She can get out.
- How?

519
00:48:12,264 --> 00:48:15,495
There's chains and metal and glass.

520
00:48:15,567 --> 00:48:17,762
Is she like this Houdini?

521
00:48:17,836 --> 00:48:20,464
Bailey already admitted
he fell asleep that night.

522
00:48:20,539 --> 00:48:25,272
Maybe Miles walked in,
saw her and opened the cage himself.

523
00:48:25,343 --> 00:48:28,835
- You're willing to take that chance?
- You know me a little, Lily.

524
00:48:28,914 --> 00:48:32,782
I'm not a murderer. But hell, yes,
I am willing to take that chance.

525
00:50:23,595 --> 00:50:25,529
Hereyou go, Captain.

526
00:50:31,336 --> 00:50:32,769
Thankyou.

527
00:50:43,214 --> 00:50:44,647
Skelly?

528
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:58,254
- Yes?
- Can I helpyou with something?

529
00:50:59,531 --> 00:51:03,729
I don't care how much treasure
we're promised.

530
00:51:03,802 --> 00:51:07,397
That beast doesn't belong here.

531
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:12,532
Right. Well, you should talk
to the captain.

532
00:51:12,611 --> 00:51:14,044
Yes.

533
00:51:15,046 --> 00:51:19,073
Well, I'll be moving on now.

534
00:51:48,613 --> 00:51:52,674
Notyet, notyet, notyet.

535
00:51:55,487 --> 00:51:57,079
Hold on, hold on.

536
00:53:07,292 --> 00:53:10,887
Stop! Please, stop!

537
00:53:14,399 --> 00:53:16,333
I'm so sorry.

538
00:53:18,002 --> 00:53:19,936
What the hell is wrong with you?

539
00:53:20,004 --> 00:53:21,437
I'm so sorry.

540
00:53:21,506 --> 00:53:26,466
Lily, forceful is one thing,
but this is mad.

541
00:53:28,313 --> 00:53:32,044
I know, I know. I don't know--

542
00:53:34,652 --> 00:53:36,085
I do.

543
00:53:46,431 --> 00:53:49,400
What is ityou want from me? Huh?

544
00:53:49,467 --> 00:53:50,900
Say it!

545
00:53:51,970 --> 00:53:55,770
Look, I knowyou can understand me...

546
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:59,435
and I knowyou're playing
some sort ofgame.

547
00:53:59,511 --> 00:54:02,571
But I wantyou out ofmy head
and out ofmy body.

548
00:54:02,647 --> 00:54:04,808
Areyou listening to me?

549
00:54:06,751 --> 00:54:08,184
Do something.

550
00:54:09,587 --> 00:54:13,318
Blink twice or tap the glass,
wag your tail.

551
00:54:14,659 --> 00:54:16,183
Shit!

552
00:54:18,963 --> 00:54:21,864
Oh, my God, what am I doing?

553
00:54:31,709 --> 00:54:33,734
Angus.

554
00:54:35,747 --> 00:54:37,738
What did you say?

555
00:54:42,954 --> 00:54:45,047
What did you say?

556
00:54:49,460 --> 00:54:53,897
You are not to touch him.
You leave him the hell alone!

557
00:56:31,162 --> 00:56:31,863
Go on.

558
00:56:31,863 --> 00:56:32,795
Go on.

559
00:57:07,065 --> 00:57:10,000
The coast is clear. Go.

560
00:57:12,537 --> 00:57:16,701
Isn't this whatyou wanted?
What areyou waiting for? Go!

561
00:57:45,870 --> 00:57:48,430
Baileywill be back any minute.

562
00:58:00,318 --> 00:58:02,479
Oh, Lily, what haveyou done?

563
00:58:09,627 --> 00:58:12,528
- Ensigns down below!
- Getyour hands here.

564
00:58:16,868 --> 00:58:18,267
Oh, Holy Mary!

565
00:58:41,659 --> 00:58:44,594
I swear to God,
you have to believe me.

566
00:58:44,662 --> 00:58:49,759
You defied me. Listen to me.
Bailey is dead. Is that whatyou wanted?

567
00:58:49,834 --> 00:58:54,567
Please believe me. She wants
to hurtyou. She told me. Please!

568
00:58:54,639 --> 00:58:56,607
Please don't leave me.
I beg ofyou.

569
00:58:56,674 --> 00:58:59,871
What am I supposed to do?
You've become completely unstable.

570
00:58:59,944 --> 00:59:02,310
I'm begging you. I'm so scared.
Please, don't leave me alone.

571
00:59:02,380 --> 00:59:04,610
You have to calm down.

572
00:59:04,682 --> 00:59:07,981
- I'll do anything. Please--
- We'll talk in the morning.

573
00:59:08,052 --> 00:59:09,986
Please, I'm calm, I'm calm.

574
00:59:33,211 --> 00:59:37,011
Angus? Areyou there?

575
00:59:40,751 --> 00:59:45,984
''Manborn ofa womanhasbutashort
time toliveandis fullofmisery.

576
00:59:46,057 --> 00:59:48,457
He cometh up and is cut down
like a flower.

577
00:59:48,526 --> 00:59:50,858
He fleeth as were a shadow.

578
00:59:50,928 --> 00:59:53,726
He never continueth in one stay.''

579
00:59:55,099 --> 00:59:59,661
In the name ofthe Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit.

580
00:59:59,737 --> 01:00:01,170
Amen.

581
01:00:05,743 --> 01:00:07,370
Bye, Bailey.

582
01:00:37,074 --> 01:00:39,133
Come on, Lily, talk to me.

583
01:00:41,612 --> 01:00:45,844
I'm sorryyou have to be in here.
Now, please.

584
01:00:45,917 --> 01:00:49,114
What I don't understand
is why she's lasted so long.

585
01:00:49,187 --> 01:00:51,121
Let's not talk about that.

586
01:00:51,189 --> 01:00:55,091
According to the museum expert, 3 weeks
is the most they last in captivity.

587
01:00:55,159 --> 01:00:57,855
- You haven't eaten anything.
- Maybe later. I'm not hungry.

588
01:00:57,929 --> 01:01:00,693
Maybe ifwe talked about
something else.

589
01:01:00,765 --> 01:01:03,233
Unless, ofcourse, it has to do
with the feeding pattern.

590
01:01:03,301 --> 01:01:06,532
Ifhuman flesh is what they eat,
which has been established...

591
01:01:06,604 --> 01:01:09,334
all those stories about mermaids
luring in the sailors...

592
01:01:09,407 --> 01:01:11,341
now we know what
they lured them in for.

593
01:01:11,409 --> 01:01:13,570
Lunch!

594
01:01:13,644 --> 01:01:18,547
Still, how could she have lasted on only
three bodies while with the Woolriches?

595
01:01:18,616 --> 01:01:20,777
- You know what I mean?
- Will you stop this?

596
01:01:20,851 --> 01:01:24,617
It doesn't make any sense.
Something about her is different.

597
01:01:24,689 --> 01:01:26,486
You're right, Lily.

598
01:01:26,557 --> 01:01:29,082
It doesn't make any sense.
And you're beginning to scare me.

599
01:01:30,528 --> 01:01:32,462
I need you to bring the book back.

600
01:01:32,530 --> 01:01:35,090
- Lily, no!
- Prisoners don't get to read?

601
01:01:35,166 --> 01:01:37,396
You're not a prisoner.
The captainjust said--

602
01:01:37,468 --> 01:01:40,562
I am a prisoner, and you think
I've lost my mind.

603
01:01:40,638 --> 01:01:44,574
Well, I will lose my mind ifyou don't
give me something to do all day in here!

604
01:01:44,642 --> 01:01:46,337
Get me the book!

605
01:01:50,414 --> 01:01:54,248
Pretty please?
I need to know.

606
01:02:15,740 --> 01:02:17,173
Thankyou.

607
01:02:55,146 --> 01:02:58,582
''I know that due to my age,
it is medically impossible...

608
01:02:58,649 --> 01:03:01,709
unless the Lord has taken matters
into His own hand.

609
01:03:01,786 --> 01:03:04,516
I'm afraid she has put this in me.''

610
01:03:07,491 --> 01:03:10,654
''Medically impossible unless the Lord
has taken matters into His own hand.

611
01:03:10,728 --> 01:03:12,719
I'm afraid she has put this in me.''

612
01:03:25,609 --> 01:03:28,043
Holy Mother ofGod.

613
01:03:36,187 --> 01:03:38,087
I'm not crazy.

614
01:03:39,156 --> 01:03:41,647
I am not crazy.

615
01:03:41,726 --> 01:03:46,254
I'm acting crazy
and I recognize it...

616
01:03:46,330 --> 01:03:49,663
and that is how I know I am not.

617
01:03:55,606 --> 01:03:57,904
Crazy, that is.

618
01:04:02,913 --> 01:04:04,813
Look, Angus...

619
01:04:08,719 --> 01:04:12,655
I know I've been acting--

620
01:04:13,991 --> 01:04:16,824
I realize how I must seem.

621
01:04:18,629 --> 01:04:22,156
I'm very affected
by this whole thing--

622
01:04:40,518 --> 01:04:41,951
All right.

623
01:04:48,559 --> 01:04:49,992
Look...

624
01:04:52,830 --> 01:04:57,028
I know it is physically,
medically...

625
01:04:57,101 --> 01:05:00,434
impossible for me to be with child.

626
01:05:01,505 --> 01:05:05,032
Angus, I know that.
Ofcourse I do.

627
01:05:07,044 --> 01:05:10,912
I wouldn't be saying any ofthis
ifI didn't find it...

628
01:05:12,049 --> 01:05:13,482
extraordinary!

629
01:05:16,020 --> 01:05:19,979
What if Mrs. Woolrich was right?

630
01:05:21,058 --> 01:05:23,652
What ifshe wasn't crazy?

631
01:05:23,727 --> 01:05:28,255
What ifshe became...

632
01:05:28,332 --> 01:05:31,995
impregnated somehow?

633
01:05:35,272 --> 01:05:39,572
What if Mrs. Woolrich was right?
What ifshe wasn't crazy?

634
01:05:39,643 --> 01:05:41,201
What if...

635
01:05:41,278 --> 01:05:42,768
she became...

636
01:05:44,081 --> 01:05:47,141
impregnated somehow?

637
01:05:47,885 --> 01:05:49,682
What ifshe wasn't crazy?

638
01:05:49,753 --> 01:05:51,880
What if--

639
01:05:51,956 --> 01:05:55,687
For argument's sake,
what if Mrs. Woolrich...

640
01:05:55,759 --> 01:05:57,818
what ifshe was right?

641
01:05:57,895 --> 01:05:59,954
What ifshe wasn't crazy?

642
01:06:01,031 --> 01:06:05,900
What ifshe became impregnated somehow?

643
01:06:57,521 --> 01:07:00,456
Come out, come out,
whereveryou are.

644
01:07:31,522 --> 01:07:33,513
I knowyou're here.

645
01:07:49,173 --> 01:07:52,267
I knowyou can't help doing
the things you do.

646
01:08:00,584 --> 01:08:02,711
That's not my fault.

647
01:08:41,692 --> 01:08:45,059
It's a full moon.
That's whyyou didn't escape before.

648
01:08:45,129 --> 01:08:48,587
Becauseyou knew that soon
you'd be changing form.

649
01:08:59,243 --> 01:09:03,339
All right. Here, here.
It's all right.

650
01:09:06,684 --> 01:09:08,618
Thereyou are.

651
01:09:25,035 --> 01:09:27,765
I'm all right. I don't think
she's going to try anything.

652
01:09:34,044 --> 01:09:35,978
Nobody fires unless I say so.

653
01:09:36,046 --> 01:09:39,447
- Get away from her!
- Please. Please.

654
01:09:41,018 --> 01:09:43,077
Shoot her! Shoot her!

655
01:09:52,496 --> 01:09:54,794
You gave me such a fright.

656
01:09:57,134 --> 01:09:59,500
Don't ever do that again.

657
01:10:01,371 --> 01:10:04,238
I thought I'd lostyou.

658
01:10:04,308 --> 01:10:06,902
A good night's rest
is in order foryou.

659
01:10:06,977 --> 01:10:10,242
This is Dr. Angus speaking, not me.

660
01:10:10,314 --> 01:10:12,748
I'll just go downstairs,
make sure everything's all right.

661
01:10:12,816 --> 01:10:14,750
- I fainted.
- I know.

662
01:10:14,818 --> 01:10:18,481
It's perfectly normal,
given the circumstances.

663
01:10:20,290 --> 01:10:23,020
I fainted because I'm with child.

664
01:10:27,331 --> 01:10:32,462
You fainted becauseyou're
in a tense and volatile situation.

665
01:10:32,536 --> 01:10:37,940
But there's something inside me.
I can feel it move.

666
01:10:38,008 --> 01:10:41,637
You're very tired,
and you haven't been eating properly...

667
01:10:41,712 --> 01:10:44,180
and you're very distressed.

668
01:10:47,618 --> 01:10:50,314
You don't know the halfofit.

669
01:10:51,688 --> 01:10:53,390
She'snotso toughanymore, isshe?

670
01:10:53,390 --> 01:10:54,220
She'snotso toughanymore, isshe?

671
01:10:54,291 --> 01:10:56,657
Take it easy.
She might sprout tail any moment.

672
01:10:56,727 --> 01:10:58,592
Does she stay human?

673
01:10:58,662 --> 01:11:02,063
I'll tell you what, she'll need
a proper place to sleep tonight.

674
01:11:02,132 --> 01:11:04,828
There's plenty ofroom in my bunk
ifshe'll promise not to bite me.

675
01:11:06,436 --> 01:11:09,667
- What kind ofa woman is she, anyway?
- What doyou thinkyou're doing?

676
01:11:09,740 --> 01:11:14,040
Making sure she's a natural blonde,
that's all.

677
01:11:14,111 --> 01:11:17,308
Maybe we should leave her alone.
There's no telling what she'll do.

678
01:11:17,381 --> 01:11:21,249
Let the men have some fun.
God knows, they've earned it.

679
01:11:21,318 --> 01:11:24,845
A deafand dumb maiden.
I like that in a woman.

680
01:11:34,398 --> 01:11:37,094
Now, now, easy does it.

681
01:11:38,669 --> 01:11:41,331
I've seen you watching me
from the tank...

682
01:11:41,405 --> 01:11:43,873
wanting to make a meal
out ofme.

683
01:11:43,941 --> 01:11:45,374
Leave her alone!

684
01:11:45,442 --> 01:11:46,875
What's your problem?

685
01:11:46,944 --> 01:11:48,935
This is a private party.

686
01:11:49,012 --> 01:11:51,776
No circus clowns invited.

687
01:11:51,849 --> 01:11:54,147
I think she's thirsty.

688
01:11:54,218 --> 01:11:57,051
You're right.
How inconsiderate ofme.

689
01:12:00,190 --> 01:12:05,059
Hold her. That's it.
Here we go. That's a good girl.

690
01:12:09,166 --> 01:12:12,101
Where areyou going, circus boy?

691
01:12:12,169 --> 01:12:14,364
Areyou going to call in
the ringmaster?

692
01:12:14,438 --> 01:12:19,034
Acting the clown's one thing, but
you're playing with everyone's safety.

693
01:12:19,109 --> 01:12:22,806
Is thatyour expert opinion
on the subject?

694
01:12:25,015 --> 01:12:27,984
You have no idea
whatyou're talking about.

695
01:12:29,052 --> 01:12:33,216
You think my men are playing with
your safety? Is that whatyou think?

696
01:12:35,325 --> 01:12:38,852
You don't know this little whore,
Gifford.

697
01:12:38,929 --> 01:12:40,954
You have no idea what--

698
01:12:41,031 --> 01:12:43,727
None ofyou have a chance!
None ofyou!

699
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:46,496
You don't know what she's done!

700
01:12:46,570 --> 01:12:49,869
- What happened?
- Son ofa bitch nearly started a riot.

701
01:12:49,940 --> 01:12:53,603
You don't know what she did.
You haven't a clue.

702
01:12:53,677 --> 01:12:55,110
That's enough!

703
01:12:59,383 --> 01:13:01,476
Oh, God!

704
01:13:01,551 --> 01:13:05,043
You have no idea...

705
01:13:05,122 --> 01:13:07,590
what she's made me do.

706
01:13:11,762 --> 01:13:14,629
Butyou'll find out.

707
01:13:15,832 --> 01:13:18,096
All right, calm down.

708
01:13:21,538 --> 01:13:24,837
Come on, Captain.
You and me need a little talk.

709
01:13:24,908 --> 01:13:29,038
Sit down. Sit down!
You and I have to talk.

710
01:13:29,112 --> 01:13:31,478
Everyone is a bit overexcited now.

711
01:13:31,548 --> 01:13:35,177
But here we go.
Start from the beginning.

712
01:13:40,958 --> 01:13:43,688
Gifford, come over here.

713
01:13:52,736 --> 01:13:55,204
Holy Mother ofJesus!

714
01:14:14,992 --> 01:14:19,520
It's nothing. Thunder.
I don't like it.

715
01:14:26,003 --> 01:14:28,164
I'm pregnant, aren't I?

716
01:14:32,943 --> 01:14:35,002
I always wanted a baby.

717
01:14:37,547 --> 01:14:39,208
I'm scared.

718
01:14:51,695 --> 01:14:53,128
Is it--

719
01:14:54,698 --> 01:14:57,064
Is it normal?

720
01:15:01,671 --> 01:15:03,605
What on earth was that?

721
01:15:20,123 --> 01:15:22,717
What's happening?

722
01:15:28,865 --> 01:15:31,766
See that over there?
Like a mass ofshadows?

723
01:15:31,835 --> 01:15:34,565
Yes, I see it.

724
01:15:34,638 --> 01:15:38,404
- That's an island. A group ofislands.
- So?

725
01:15:38,475 --> 01:15:42,707
So it's the queerest thing.
There is no group ofisland like such...

726
01:15:42,779 --> 01:15:45,009
in the path to New York Harbor.

727
01:15:45,082 --> 01:15:47,642
Not unless the captain read
the charts wrong.

728
01:15:58,228 --> 01:16:00,162
She brought us home.

729
01:16:02,365 --> 01:16:05,129
Get that sail up now!

730
01:16:09,172 --> 01:16:10,662
Rocks dead ahead.
Right full rudder.

731
01:16:10,740 --> 01:16:13,607
I don't care whatyou do,
just turn this thing around.

732
01:16:13,677 --> 01:16:15,702
I can't. We don't have room.

733
01:16:17,214 --> 01:16:20,115
Go below. Check for damage.

734
01:16:37,300 --> 01:16:39,234
That must hurt.

735
01:17:23,446 --> 01:17:25,107
Please don't hurt me!

736
01:17:37,260 --> 01:17:40,127
That doesn't sound like thunder.

737
01:17:45,635 --> 01:17:48,229
That's more like it.

738
01:18:01,851 --> 01:18:04,843
You've done it now. Come on!

739
01:18:25,208 --> 01:18:27,369
- Go!
- You go.

740
01:18:56,439 --> 01:18:57,770
Where's Lily?

741
01:18:57,841 --> 01:19:01,777
I don't know.
That thing, it's not the mermaid.

742
01:19:01,845 --> 01:19:05,838
- What areyou talking about?
- It's something else. Darts won't work.

743
01:19:05,915 --> 01:19:08,145
You can put down an elephant
with one ofthese things.

744
01:19:08,218 --> 01:19:12,678
You told me that before.
Trust me, this is not an elephant.

745
01:19:13,990 --> 01:19:16,015
The bullets are in
the captain's quarters. Come on.

746
01:19:16,092 --> 01:19:18,686
I just came from there,
and I'm not going back.

747
01:19:18,762 --> 01:19:20,195
Fine. Stay.

748
01:19:38,148 --> 01:19:39,979
Don't make a sound.

749
01:19:42,252 --> 01:19:44,379
I'm going to check the hatchway.

750
01:20:14,684 --> 01:20:18,347
- Let's move. We're sitting ducks here.
- You go. I'll go find Lily.

751
01:20:18,421 --> 01:20:21,219
Go where? Where's the rest ofthe crew?
We need a plan.

752
01:20:21,291 --> 01:20:24,988
The plan is to find Lily and then
shoot the thing out ofthe water.

753
01:20:25,061 --> 01:20:29,191
You haven't seen it. It's got claws
like knives and horns out to here.

754
01:20:29,265 --> 01:20:32,428
What doyou want me to do?
Ifyou've a better idea, tell me!

755
01:20:39,476 --> 01:20:42,570
Lily!Jesus, areyou all right?

756
01:20:45,782 --> 01:20:47,511
Move, move, move!

757
01:21:21,651 --> 01:21:23,949
Here's the rest ofthe crew.

758
01:21:26,489 --> 01:21:29,049
What the devil is that thing?

759
01:21:29,125 --> 01:21:31,923
It's the Queen ofthe Lair
Woolrich warned us about.

760
01:21:31,995 --> 01:21:34,987
The queen ofthe what?
What areyou talking about?

761
01:21:35,064 --> 01:21:38,295
It doesn't matter. The question is,
what is she going to do?

762
01:21:38,368 --> 01:21:40,666
Feed us to her lair.

763
01:21:40,737 --> 01:21:42,967
Doyou mean there's more?

764
01:21:43,039 --> 01:21:48,170
An island full ofmermaids.
That's why she brought us here.

765
01:21:49,245 --> 01:21:51,179
She's the provider.

766
01:21:52,248 --> 01:21:56,378
But no one gets to see the
Forbidden Islands and walk out alive.

767
01:21:56,453 --> 01:21:58,785
That's how they've lasted so long.

768
01:21:59,522 --> 01:22:03,014
- And you knew about this?
- I told you all I knew.

769
01:22:03,092 --> 01:22:05,925
You told me, let's take a mermaid
to America, get rich and famous.

770
01:22:05,995 --> 01:22:09,624
Not, steal the queen ofwhat's-it who
turns into a monster and eats people.

771
01:22:09,699 --> 01:22:11,633
I would've remembered
the difference.

772
01:22:11,701 --> 01:22:13,225
Stop it.

773
01:22:19,142 --> 01:22:21,576
I'm not waiting around down here.

774
01:22:22,645 --> 01:22:24,579
I'm going up.

775
01:23:15,798 --> 01:23:17,857
Let's get outta here.

776
01:23:38,521 --> 01:23:43,618
God Almighty, ifYou're up there,
ifYou're watching down on us...

777
01:23:43,693 --> 01:23:47,220
please, we have learned our lesson.

778
01:23:47,297 --> 01:23:49,731
Please save us.

779
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:55,596
I reallywanted to have
a future with you, to grow old with you.

780
01:23:55,672 --> 01:23:58,004
This is all my fault.
I loveyou so much.

781
01:23:58,074 --> 01:24:00,099
I loveyou too!

782
01:24:39,248 --> 01:24:41,478
Stop!

783
01:24:50,760 --> 01:24:52,352
Stop!

784
01:25:19,255 --> 01:25:21,223
Please don't hurt us.

785
01:26:41,838 --> 01:26:43,465
Jesus Christ!

786
01:27:11,701 --> 01:27:13,134
Miss, what happened?

787
01:27:15,438 --> 01:27:17,429
Where's your crew?

788
01:27:18,841 --> 01:27:20,775
Wereyou attacked?

789
01:27:30,186 --> 01:27:34,782
