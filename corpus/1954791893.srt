1
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:12,111
That's the untraceable
question, but what is love?

2
00:00:14,315 --> 00:00:18,350
Hmm. Mm. Mm.

3
00:00:20,254 --> 00:00:21,754
Um...

4
00:00:21,756 --> 00:00:26,091
People have tried to define
that for the longest time.

5
00:00:28,562 --> 00:00:33,065
Love is when you can
look in each other's eyes

6
00:00:33,067 --> 00:00:38,337
and just know they're...
she's gonna be there for you.

7
00:00:38,339 --> 00:00:41,640
It's that sense of excitement

8
00:00:41,642 --> 00:00:44,443
and... Adventure.

9
00:00:44,445 --> 00:00:47,146
It's that feeling of
I can't live without her.

10
00:00:47,148 --> 00:00:48,614
Don't want to live without her.

11
00:00:48,616 --> 00:00:51,050
You want to be with someone,

12
00:00:51,052 --> 00:00:53,752
take care of someone.

13
00:00:53,754 --> 00:00:55,821
Be close with someone.

14
00:00:55,823 --> 00:00:58,524
Caring for somebody
and their well-being

15
00:00:58,526 --> 00:01:00,292
more than you care
for your own.

16
00:01:00,294 --> 00:01:03,762
Finding someone you
can be compatible with

17
00:01:03,764 --> 00:01:05,497
and be committed to.

18
00:01:25,853 --> 00:01:27,853
Each year,
thousands of foreign women

19
00:01:27,855 --> 00:01:29,555
marry American men

20
00:01:29,557 --> 00:01:31,190
through so-called
international matchmakers.

21
00:01:31,192 --> 00:01:33,225
A view from the room.

22
00:01:33,227 --> 00:01:36,095
Come on, people, work with me.

23
00:01:36,097 --> 00:01:37,729
One of the most important
things you'll ever do

24
00:01:37,731 --> 00:01:39,231
is try to find that one person

25
00:01:39,233 --> 00:01:40,432
you want to spend the
rest of your life with.

26
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:42,568
The international
matchmaking industry,

27
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:45,571
better known as
mail order bride business,

28
00:01:45,573 --> 00:01:46,805
is booming.

29
00:01:46,807 --> 00:01:49,741
Many of the men
that call me will tell me

30
00:01:49,743 --> 00:01:51,610
it's difficult
to find women here

31
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:54,246
in the United States
that are even interested

32
00:01:54,248 --> 00:01:57,316
in long-term relationships
and marriage.

33
00:01:57,318 --> 00:01:58,550
There are so many

34
00:01:58,552 --> 00:02:01,353
really sincere, wonderful,
wonderful women

35
00:02:01,355 --> 00:02:04,323
in Russia, Ukraine,
China, everywhere,

36
00:02:04,325 --> 00:02:06,225
who really want
to find somebody

37
00:02:06,227 --> 00:02:07,693
to build family with.

38
00:02:07,695 --> 00:02:10,496
Most of our clients,
they're not willing to settle,

39
00:02:10,498 --> 00:02:11,830
so wy not look
for that life mate

40
00:02:11,832 --> 00:02:13,465
in a different country?

41
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:16,168
There's a misconception
that these relationships

42
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:18,670
are set up to give
the men the upper hand.

43
00:02:18,672 --> 00:02:20,205
I am upper hand.

44
00:02:20,207 --> 00:02:22,474
You're the upper hand
in this relationship?

45
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:24,877
- Are we ready to go?
- We're ready. Let's do it.

46
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:27,346
You and me, babe.

47
00:02:27,348 --> 00:02:31,483
How often does reality
really meet expectation?

48
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:32,751
Oh, quite often,

49
00:02:32,753 --> 00:02:35,721
but it doesn't always
happen right away.

50
00:02:35,723 --> 00:02:39,391
And welcome to
"a foreign affair live."

51
00:02:39,393 --> 00:02:41,627
My name is John Adams,

52
00:02:41,629 --> 00:02:43,562
co-founder of a foreign affair.

53
00:02:43,564 --> 00:02:46,832
And I will be your guide
as we explore

54
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:49,935
the beautiful world of
international introductions.

55
00:02:51,772 --> 00:02:54,840
I've always heard about
mail order brides.

56
00:02:54,842 --> 00:02:57,576
Originally, a guy
would order a wife

57
00:02:57,578 --> 00:02:59,845
with no idea,
maybe a picture of her.

58
00:02:59,847 --> 00:03:01,947
But with the advent
of the Internet,

59
00:03:01,949 --> 00:03:06,485
now it made things much
more visual and real

60
00:03:06,487 --> 00:03:09,388
to see the girls,
to write 'em emails.

61
00:03:10,824 --> 00:03:12,624
My name's Robert Wilson,

62
00:03:12,626 --> 00:03:14,726
I'm from Fresno, California,

63
00:03:14,728 --> 00:03:16,862
work in
heavy steel construction...

64
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:20,332
roads, Bridges, freeways.

65
00:03:20,334 --> 00:03:24,503
Since my divorce,
it hasn't been great.

66
00:03:24,505 --> 00:03:27,506
It's tough out there.

67
00:03:27,508 --> 00:03:30,342
You know, when you have
a full-time job,

68
00:03:30,344 --> 00:03:32,311
it's tough to meet people,

69
00:03:32,313 --> 00:03:34,680
and I want to meet a woman.

70
00:03:34,682 --> 00:03:36,315
One woman.

71
00:03:36,317 --> 00:03:38,884
That's all I'm looking for
is one woman.

72
00:03:38,886 --> 00:03:40,852
Meeting someone from overseas...

73
00:03:40,854 --> 00:03:44,523
I feel like if I can
meet the right one

74
00:03:44,525 --> 00:03:46,425
that she might be more serious

75
00:03:46,427 --> 00:03:48,794
about actually
building a relationship

76
00:03:48,796 --> 00:03:51,563
and giving it the time
we would need.

77
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:53,498
My name is Eric ireton.

78
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,867
I'm a mechanical engineer.

79
00:03:55,869 --> 00:03:57,703
I live in San Antonio, Texas.

80
00:03:57,705 --> 00:03:58,904
I'm 45.

81
00:03:58,906 --> 00:04:00,839
What's your favorite gun?

82
00:04:00,841 --> 00:04:02,674
Do you have it in there?

83
00:04:02,676 --> 00:04:04,409
Favorite gun?

84
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:05,877
I don't know. It's hard
to have a favorite.

85
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:08,547
.357 Magnum.

86
00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:10,515
The first handgun I bought.

87
00:04:10,517 --> 00:04:12,784
Got my 12-gauge shotgun.

88
00:04:12,786 --> 00:04:15,621
Ak-47, ar-15.

89
00:04:15,623 --> 00:04:17,356
A little .22 caliber

90
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:19,825
with a 20-gauge shotgun
over/under.

91
00:04:21,795 --> 00:04:23,795
When was your last
serious relationship,

92
00:04:23,797 --> 00:04:26,531
like, here?

93
00:04:26,533 --> 00:04:28,300
I've never had one.

94
00:04:30,537 --> 00:04:33,805
I tried the army and a few of
these other regular dating sites.

95
00:04:33,807 --> 00:04:35,574
Never worked for me.

96
00:04:35,576 --> 00:04:38,810
My name's Bobby Cannon. I'm 46.

97
00:04:38,812 --> 00:04:40,345
And I work in human resources

98
00:04:40,347 --> 00:04:41,680
for the federal government.

99
00:04:41,682 --> 00:04:43,548
And my views are mine alone,

100
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:44,750
not the government's.

101
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:47,953
So this is the living room.

102
00:04:47,955 --> 00:04:49,855
This is where I spend
most of the day

103
00:04:49,857 --> 00:04:50,956
when I'm at home.

104
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:54,393
I've got some of my collection.

105
00:04:54,395 --> 00:04:56,895
I tend to be a little bit shy,

106
00:04:56,897 --> 00:04:58,930
so I don't meet a lot of folks

107
00:04:58,932 --> 00:05:01,933
for relationship purposes.

108
00:05:01,935 --> 00:05:04,303
And to be honest, you know,

109
00:05:04,305 --> 00:05:07,539
I'm a little bit heavier,

110
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:10,542
so that is something
that is a real negative

111
00:05:10,544 --> 00:05:13,045
in the United States.

112
00:05:13,047 --> 00:05:14,613
I hated dating.

113
00:05:14,615 --> 00:05:16,481
I got on your popular sites,

114
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:19,084
and my first five dates

115
00:05:19,086 --> 00:05:21,987
lasted less than five minutes.

116
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:23,822
All five of 'em.

117
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:28,760
I'm Ron Kirby. I'm from
north Carolina at pinehurst.

118
00:05:28,762 --> 00:05:30,429
I married
my childhood sweetheart.

119
00:05:30,431 --> 00:05:33,432
Met her when she was 12.
I was 13.

120
00:05:33,434 --> 00:05:37,502
Got married at 18.
Three kids by 26.

121
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:39,104
We were married for 28 years.

122
00:05:39,106 --> 00:05:42,874
If there was one thing
missing in our marriage,

123
00:05:42,876 --> 00:05:44,009
it was this:

124
00:05:44,011 --> 00:05:47,412
I felt taken advantage of.

125
00:05:47,414 --> 00:05:49,381
What I wanted from my wife

126
00:05:49,383 --> 00:05:50,749
was a pat on the back
now and then,

127
00:05:50,751 --> 00:05:53,552
an "attaboy, I'm proud of you."

128
00:05:53,554 --> 00:05:55,821
Just not being
taken for granted.

129
00:05:55,823 --> 00:05:57,723
I do want to be married,

130
00:05:57,725 --> 00:05:59,825
so I got to looking
on the Internet.

131
00:05:59,827 --> 00:06:02,561
And of course, you know, you can
find anything on the Internet.

132
00:06:02,563 --> 00:06:06,031
My name's Travis needham
from plain, Wisconsin.

133
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:08,533
38 years old.

134
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:11,536
So how many cows
are you going to milk today?

135
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:14,573
About 170, 175.

136
00:06:14,575 --> 00:06:16,375
I don't know the exact number.

137
00:06:17,945 --> 00:06:21,813
I know it's a lot more
than I want to milk.

138
00:06:26,019 --> 00:06:30,155
I haven't really
dated a lot of girls,

139
00:06:30,157 --> 00:06:32,457
other than one, and...

140
00:06:33,694 --> 00:06:35,994
Let's just leave it at that.

141
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:39,998
Where are all the women
in this town?

142
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,733
There's a lot of guys.

143
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:44,603
I could think of six single
women off the top of my head,

144
00:06:44,605 --> 00:06:47,439
and probably most
are divorcees.

145
00:06:47,441 --> 00:06:48,774
Around here, work ethic.

146
00:06:48,776 --> 00:06:50,108
You don't got time.

147
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:52,544
I wouldn't take it
as a personal thing.

148
00:06:52,546 --> 00:06:54,513
It's just there's not
a lot of women here.

149
00:06:54,515 --> 00:06:58,683
It's almost like living
with the eskimos, you know?

150
00:07:01,121 --> 00:07:03,889
I got frustrated
with American women,

151
00:07:03,891 --> 00:07:06,992
so I typed into Google
something about Russian brides.

152
00:07:06,994 --> 00:07:08,960
A foreign affair came up.

153
00:07:08,962 --> 00:07:11,029
Welcome to
the fascinating world

154
00:07:11,031 --> 00:07:12,164
of a foreign affair,

155
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:14,866
where true love
knows no boundaries.

156
00:07:14,868 --> 00:07:16,168
My name is John Adams,

157
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:18,003
president of a foreign affair,

158
00:07:18,005 --> 00:07:20,572
and I would like to thank you
for taking the time

159
00:07:20,574 --> 00:07:22,073
to learn more
about this exciting

160
00:07:22,075 --> 00:07:23,809
and very real process

161
00:07:23,811 --> 00:07:26,778
of finding
your special someone.

162
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,880
You look at John Adams...

163
00:07:28,882 --> 00:07:30,682
and John, if you're
looking at this,

164
00:07:30,684 --> 00:07:31,850
don't get mad at me...

165
00:07:31,852 --> 00:07:33,685
but he's an average guy.

166
00:07:33,687 --> 00:07:35,720
He isn't the best-looking
guy in the world.

167
00:07:35,722 --> 00:07:37,889
He's a got a little bit
of a pooch, like he said.

168
00:07:37,891 --> 00:07:40,559
And yet it worked for him.

169
00:07:41,995 --> 00:07:44,129
I was lucky enough
to find my Russian bride

170
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:45,664
several years ago

171
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:47,599
with the assistance
of a foreign affair,

172
00:07:47,601 --> 00:07:51,203
and I assure you that it
can work for you as well.

173
00:07:51,205 --> 00:07:53,772
So then you have to say
if it worked for John,

174
00:07:53,774 --> 00:07:57,108
you know, certainly, maybe,
maybe it could work for me.

175
00:08:05,486 --> 00:08:06,952
She's kind of cute.

176
00:08:09,022 --> 00:08:10,055
Cute.

177
00:08:13,193 --> 00:08:14,759
Possibly.

178
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:17,596
A foreign affair

179
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:20,599
is really just
an international version

180
00:08:20,601 --> 00:08:22,167
of any kind of
local dating service

181
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:24,002
that you would go to online

182
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:25,537
in order
to try to meet someone,

183
00:08:25,539 --> 00:08:28,540
only we focus more on
the international sector.

184
00:08:28,542 --> 00:08:31,109
We have about 16 or 17
different offices

185
00:08:31,111 --> 00:08:32,677
around the world,
and we're dealing with

186
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:35,080
thousands and thousands
of clients every month.

187
00:08:35,082 --> 00:08:37,949
All you do is find
the computers, you can register,

188
00:08:37,951 --> 00:08:40,018
and you can start meeting
people from everywhere.

189
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,853
I was lucky enough
to meet Tanya

190
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:43,688
through a foreign affair,
actually,

191
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,590
so, yeah, I'm a great example

192
00:08:45,592 --> 00:08:46,925
of how it can work,

193
00:08:46,927 --> 00:08:48,827
and it does work.

194
00:08:48,829 --> 00:08:50,829
What happens
when you're lucky enough

195
00:08:50,831 --> 00:08:53,765
to meet the love of your life?

196
00:08:53,767 --> 00:08:55,267
Over here.

197
00:08:57,004 --> 00:08:58,803
What happens
when you're lucky enough

198
00:08:58,805 --> 00:09:00,605
to meet the love of your life?

199
00:09:00,607 --> 00:09:02,040
Pretty slow.
A little slow over here.

200
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:03,842
He's gotta wake up.
Get that coffee going.

201
00:09:03,844 --> 00:09:06,545
I met John when I was 27,

202
00:09:06,547 --> 00:09:07,946
and when I was 29,

203
00:09:07,948 --> 00:09:10,048
I moved to the United States.

204
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:13,885
I came from
St. Petersburg, Russia.

205
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:17,088
John said it's my first
marriage and your last.

206
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:19,824
So, yeah, it's the second one.

207
00:09:21,695 --> 00:09:24,162
The Internet really changed
the way we date,

208
00:09:24,164 --> 00:09:25,864
both internationally
and domestically.

209
00:09:25,866 --> 00:09:28,667
When the men do go to the site,

210
00:09:28,669 --> 00:09:30,068
they have to register
on the site.

211
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:32,771
And then they can
start writing letters

212
00:09:32,773 --> 00:09:35,874
to the women.

213
00:09:35,876 --> 00:09:37,342
You've got to pay for letters

214
00:09:37,344 --> 00:09:40,045
because it will actually
translate letters for you

215
00:09:40,047 --> 00:09:41,179
and get them to the women

216
00:09:41,181 --> 00:09:42,280
and get the replies
back for you.

217
00:09:42,282 --> 00:09:45,116
I got on the afa website,

218
00:09:45,118 --> 00:09:47,285
and I started
getting some letters

219
00:09:47,287 --> 00:09:49,988
from some women in Ukraine.

220
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:51,923
I really didn't even know

221
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:53,692
what Ukraine was.

222
00:09:54,962 --> 00:09:56,962
The women there
are just gorgeous.

223
00:09:56,964 --> 00:09:59,698
I found 10 women
that I really liked,

224
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,866
so I started writing to them.

225
00:10:01,868 --> 00:10:03,301
All 10 wrote back.

226
00:10:03,303 --> 00:10:06,638
I spent a lot of money
in correspondence

227
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,206
and I thought, you know,
you just gotta go over there

228
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:10,842
and meet these women.

229
00:10:10,844 --> 00:10:11,910
John: As the Internet does grow

230
00:10:11,912 --> 00:10:13,378
and as the world shrinks,

231
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,746
people are going to continue

232
00:10:14,748 --> 00:10:16,381
to start looking
outside the boundaries

233
00:10:16,383 --> 00:10:17,916
because why wouldn't you?

234
00:10:17,918 --> 00:10:19,684
It's right in
your own living room now.

235
00:10:34,234 --> 00:10:36,968
I am Elena petrova.

236
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:40,305
I am the owner
of Elena's models,

237
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:43,808
a dating agency
that specializes

238
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:47,278
in introducing women
from eastern Europe

239
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:51,016
with men from
all over the world.

240
00:10:51,018 --> 00:10:53,918
I was born in
yekaterinburg, Russia,

241
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,389
and I moved to Australia
to join my husband

242
00:10:57,391 --> 00:10:59,791
about 15 years ago.

243
00:10:59,793 --> 00:11:01,292
You were a popular
mail order bride.

244
00:11:01,294 --> 00:11:04,896
Yes, I was a popular
mail order bride.

245
00:11:04,898 --> 00:11:07,932
Marriage for a woman
in eastern Europe,

246
00:11:07,934 --> 00:11:09,300
it's such a huge value.

247
00:11:09,302 --> 00:11:11,436
It's so up there,

248
00:11:11,438 --> 00:11:15,273
she's going to give up
anything to get it.

249
00:11:16,743 --> 00:11:21,379
We have more than 200,000
active profiles.

250
00:11:21,381 --> 00:11:24,349
We personally talk with
the majority of women

251
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:25,984
before we approve
their profiles.

252
00:11:25,986 --> 00:11:27,986
Our business model
is very simple.

253
00:11:27,988 --> 00:11:29,821
You place your profile.

254
00:11:29,823 --> 00:11:31,690
You're responsible
for your profile.

255
00:11:31,692 --> 00:11:33,458
We just do our best

256
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:36,227
to ensure that there are
only genuine, sincere people

257
00:11:36,229 --> 00:11:38,930
on our website.

258
00:11:38,932 --> 00:11:42,033
Okay. Let's go, mate.

259
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:44,436
God, dumb machine.

260
00:11:46,973 --> 00:11:48,373
My name is Michael,

261
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:51,076
and I can actually say
that in Russian, too.

262
00:11:53,714 --> 00:11:55,780
That's my name.

263
00:11:58,485 --> 00:12:00,885
Nice area this, huh?

264
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:04,089
My first wife,

265
00:12:04,091 --> 00:12:06,491
she left me after 10 years.

266
00:12:06,493 --> 00:12:10,495
Threw all that out. So have I.

267
00:12:10,497 --> 00:12:16,334
My second wife passed
away with cancer in '98.

268
00:12:16,336 --> 00:12:19,304
She had leukemia
and it was quick.

269
00:12:19,306 --> 00:12:21,973
We were only married
for four years.

270
00:12:23,977 --> 00:12:25,977
Morning. How are you?

271
00:12:25,979 --> 00:12:29,080
I'm not getting younger.
I don't want to be alone.

272
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:30,915
Been like that
for 12 years, you know,

273
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:32,484
and it's not really happy.

274
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,186
I support Elena's models

275
00:12:35,188 --> 00:12:37,455
because it's the honor system.

276
00:12:37,457 --> 00:12:40,358
You can contact
the girls, you know,

277
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,393
once they're interested in you.

278
00:12:42,395 --> 00:12:46,064
And you can start talking
to them straight away.

279
00:12:48,068 --> 00:12:50,902
Svitlana sent me some pictures.

280
00:12:50,904 --> 00:12:52,871
That's svitlana.

281
00:12:52,873 --> 00:12:55,440
There's also
another one she sent me,

282
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:57,275
and I really love this photo.

283
00:12:57,277 --> 00:13:01,880
I don't know, because
I just like her smile there.

284
00:13:01,882 --> 00:13:03,214
I saw svitlana.

285
00:13:03,216 --> 00:13:05,483
She was a newcomer on Elena's.

286
00:13:05,485 --> 00:13:07,886
I thought she looks nice,

287
00:13:07,888 --> 00:13:11,122
and she had this sort of like
sad look in her eyes.

288
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:12,390
You know, I always
look for the eyes.

289
00:13:12,392 --> 00:13:13,925
I don't know, you know.

290
00:13:13,927 --> 00:13:16,127
And I thought I'll
give her a go, you know,

291
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:18,329
although she was,
like, 37 years old.

292
00:13:18,331 --> 00:13:20,832
I thought, well, I'm just
gonna have a chat with her.

293
00:13:20,834 --> 00:13:24,569
Sasha, Elena. Svitlana's girls.

294
00:13:24,571 --> 00:13:28,139
Svitlana and that's Elena.

295
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:30,842
We started communicating
through Elena's

296
00:13:30,844 --> 00:13:32,043
for a couple of months,

297
00:13:32,045 --> 00:13:34,212
and then she gave me
her email address

298
00:13:34,214 --> 00:13:36,381
and we started with email,
addressing her.

299
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:40,518
Elena: In Ukraine, there
is 87 men for 100 women.

300
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,921
And drinking is huge problem.

301
00:13:42,923 --> 00:13:44,155
Most Ukrainian guys,

302
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:46,124
as they become
a bit older and older,

303
00:13:46,126 --> 00:13:47,358
they drink more and more.

304
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,928
So lots of women
are using our website

305
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:51,196
to meet someone

306
00:13:51,198 --> 00:13:54,299
simply because
there are not enough men

307
00:13:54,301 --> 00:13:56,501
that she can choose from.

308
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:03,308
John: We want people to meet.

309
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:06,110
We want them to be successful,

310
00:14:06,112 --> 00:14:09,914
to actually have
a meaningful relationship.

311
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:12,150
We always preach they should
actually get on a plane

312
00:14:12,152 --> 00:14:14,018
and go over and meet
these women in person,

313
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,954
because that's the only way

314
00:14:15,956 --> 00:14:17,522
anything's ever
going to happen for you

315
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:19,390
if you want something
to happen for you.

316
00:14:19,392 --> 00:14:21,459
I'm sure you're wondering,

317
00:14:21,461 --> 00:14:23,995
"can I really travel
halfway around the world

318
00:14:23,997 --> 00:14:26,097
and develop
a meaningful relationship,

319
00:14:26,099 --> 00:14:28,399
one that will result
in marriage?"

320
00:14:28,401 --> 00:14:31,002
The answer is yes.

321
00:14:31,004 --> 00:14:33,404
The romance tour
is absolutely amazing.

322
00:14:33,406 --> 00:14:37,075
It is the best experience
that you'll ever have.

323
00:14:37,077 --> 00:14:39,143
My cousin told me
he would never do it.

324
00:14:39,145 --> 00:14:40,945
I said, "why?" He says,
"I wouldn't spend the money.

325
00:14:40,947 --> 00:14:42,380
I'm too much of a tightwad."

326
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:45,183
And my answer was, "well,
what's happiness worth?

327
00:14:45,185 --> 00:14:47,886
$12,000 to meet
a beautiful woman

328
00:14:47,888 --> 00:14:49,387
that I love, that loves me?

329
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:51,122
That's nothing."

330
00:14:51,124 --> 00:14:53,958
I don't really feel like
it's my last chance,

331
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,994
but I just didn't want
to be along anymore

332
00:14:55,996 --> 00:14:58,997
and nothing was
happening around here.

333
00:14:58,999 --> 00:15:01,199
Why would anyone else
spend this kind of money

334
00:15:01,201 --> 00:15:03,134
to find a wife?

335
00:15:03,136 --> 00:15:05,003
Bob: We're going to
three separate cities

336
00:15:05,005 --> 00:15:09,007
during the trip: Odessa,
nikolayev, and kherson.

337
00:15:09,009 --> 00:15:10,909
It starts in New York at jfk,

338
00:15:10,911 --> 00:15:12,343
everybody's meeting
for the first time.

339
00:15:12,345 --> 00:15:15,346
Everybody's kind of
sizing everybody else up.

340
00:15:15,348 --> 00:15:17,148
It's kind of like a road trip

341
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:18,683
if you're in
a fraternity, in a way,

342
00:15:18,685 --> 00:15:20,218
but it has a purpose,
of course,

343
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,419
which a road trip does not.

344
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:23,021
I'm Bob wray.

345
00:15:23,023 --> 00:15:24,188
I'm a tour director

346
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:26,958
for a foreign affair tour.

347
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,960
There's a lot of faith
involved in this.

348
00:15:28,962 --> 00:15:31,362
There has to be
because you're asking men,

349
00:15:31,364 --> 00:15:33,598
look, fork over
a few thousand dollars,

350
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,633
take a couple of weeks
out of your schedule,

351
00:15:35,635 --> 00:15:37,302
and come over with us.

352
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:54,085
- That's ours?
- That's ours.

353
00:15:54,087 --> 00:15:56,054
Gotta move.

354
00:16:01,628 --> 00:16:04,629
All right, guys. We made it!

355
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:08,566
Welcome to Odessa, Ukraine.

356
00:16:08,568 --> 00:16:10,501
You can watch
the guys on the bus

357
00:16:10,503 --> 00:16:12,236
and they're kind of looking
around out the window,

358
00:16:12,238 --> 00:16:15,406
like, "wow, wow,
this is strange."

359
00:16:15,408 --> 00:16:17,508
You can just see them
just thinking and looking,

360
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:20,645
and, you know, there's a
little bit of apprehension,

361
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:22,080
a little bit of fear, maybe,

362
00:16:22,082 --> 00:16:23,381
a little bit
of all these things

363
00:16:23,383 --> 00:16:25,183
going through their minds

364
00:16:25,185 --> 00:16:27,518
because it's not the easiest
process in the world.

365
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,120
It really isn't.

366
00:16:30,457 --> 00:16:34,592
Finding someone for
a relationship abroad

367
00:16:34,594 --> 00:16:37,996
is very similar
to finding a job abroad.

368
00:16:37,998 --> 00:16:40,164
If you can get better pay,

369
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:42,000
you probably will go.

370
00:16:42,002 --> 00:16:44,235
Or if you want
adventure, you will go.

371
00:16:44,237 --> 00:16:47,438
If I can get more
than I can get locally,

372
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,074
then I'll go.

373
00:16:50,076 --> 00:16:53,678
One day, svitlana asked me,
am I for real?

374
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:57,315
I said I'm for real.
I'll come see you.

375
00:16:57,317 --> 00:17:00,418
So I'm planning
to fly over to Kiev

376
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:02,053
for a week.

377
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:12,096
I don't like something
that's ordinary.

378
00:17:12,098 --> 00:17:13,765
I like something that's
out of the ordinary.

379
00:17:13,767 --> 00:17:17,301
I suppose that's why
I'm going to Russia for a girl.

380
00:17:17,303 --> 00:17:19,604
I like something
out of the ordinary.

381
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:36,487
Michael: It's an adventure,
you know.

382
00:17:36,489 --> 00:17:38,156
For me, I like adventure.

383
00:17:38,158 --> 00:17:40,691
I feel motivated by doing it.

384
00:17:41,795 --> 00:17:44,295
I really feel motivated.

385
00:17:44,297 --> 00:17:48,232
I did not really achieve
what I wanted in life.

386
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:50,768
I need some more time.

387
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:53,571
I just want to be happy
and it doesn't matter where,

388
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:55,406
where I'm going to find it,
you know.

389
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:56,674
If it's here
in the Ukraine, why not?

390
00:17:56,676 --> 00:17:57,708
I'll come here.

391
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:07,418
Yippy kay-ay.

392
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:10,288
All right, guys.

393
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:13,091
We're gonna get started here
with this orientation.

394
00:18:13,093 --> 00:18:15,626
Now, a social,
it's not a cocktail party.

395
00:18:15,628 --> 00:18:17,128
It's a great opportunity

396
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:19,530
to meet a lot of different
people at one time.

397
00:18:19,532 --> 00:18:21,532
Right? It's all about
moving around

398
00:18:21,534 --> 00:18:23,668
as much as possible
to try to meet

399
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:25,703
as many different people
as possible.

400
00:18:25,705 --> 00:18:27,805
The first big event of this
whole tour is the social.

401
00:18:27,807 --> 00:18:30,208
That's what everybody's
looking forward to,

402
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:32,810
so everybody is ready for that.

403
00:18:32,812 --> 00:18:35,646
I don't have any expectations.

404
00:18:35,648 --> 00:18:37,548
My plans are to shake the hands

405
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:39,250
of every single woman
there tonight.

406
00:18:39,252 --> 00:18:40,852
Hi. I'm Ron.

407
00:18:40,854 --> 00:18:44,589
I am Ron. And I am Ron.

408
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:05,176
I really want to welcome
you all for coming.

409
00:19:05,178 --> 00:19:07,378
It's really important that if
you see someone that you like,

410
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:08,513
don't be shy.

411
00:19:08,515 --> 00:19:09,580
Just go up to him

412
00:19:09,582 --> 00:19:11,182
and say, hey,
can I talk to you?

413
00:19:11,184 --> 00:19:13,451
I guarantee you that the men

414
00:19:13,453 --> 00:19:15,353
are more shy than you are.

415
00:19:15,355 --> 00:19:17,288
It was like being a kid
in a candy store.

416
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:20,758
I wasn't really quite
sure how to handle it.

417
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,161
My job is to go around

418
00:19:23,163 --> 00:19:26,831
and encourage the men to be as
proactive as they possibly can

419
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:29,333
and talk to as many women
as they possibly can,

420
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:31,802
and have a good time
at the same time.

421
00:19:31,804 --> 00:19:33,838
I'm overwhelmed by the
attention I've gotten.

422
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,273
A lot of my friends
who are single

423
00:19:35,275 --> 00:19:37,642
thought I was crazy
to come over here,

424
00:19:37,644 --> 00:19:39,944
but I tend to always
think outside the box.

425
00:19:39,946 --> 00:19:44,482
We had 210 women
at that social.

426
00:19:44,484 --> 00:19:46,184
20 guys.

427
00:19:46,186 --> 00:19:47,885
A 10 to 1 ratio.

428
00:19:47,887 --> 00:19:50,188
Welcome to paradise.

429
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:52,790
For me, it's been
very nerve-wracking.

430
00:19:52,792 --> 00:19:55,526
A lot of beautiful women,

431
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:57,695
and it's not like that at home.

432
00:19:57,697 --> 00:19:59,430
They just can't believe

433
00:19:59,432 --> 00:20:01,199
that these women
are interested in them,

434
00:20:01,201 --> 00:20:02,967
because they're used to
the situation at home

435
00:20:02,969 --> 00:20:04,735
where nobody's
interested in them.

436
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:10,942
These women
believe in family first.

437
00:20:10,944 --> 00:20:13,211
Not career first. Family first.

438
00:20:13,213 --> 00:20:15,346
I'll tell you, it's like
dating a girl from the fifties.

439
00:20:15,348 --> 00:20:16,814
It's like dating my mom.

440
00:20:16,816 --> 00:20:19,984
� American boys �

441
00:20:24,524 --> 00:20:26,691
I can speak in front
of 3,000 people,

442
00:20:26,693 --> 00:20:29,327
but getting on
that dance floor,

443
00:20:29,329 --> 00:20:30,561
that makes me nervous.

444
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:31,562
You gonna do it?

445
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:32,897
Growing up Southern baptist,

446
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:35,233
I've never danced.

447
00:20:35,235 --> 00:20:38,336
If I find the right one,
I might.

448
00:20:38,338 --> 00:20:42,273
I've been trying to be
realistic in my search.

449
00:20:42,275 --> 00:20:43,874
I'm in pretty good shape
for my age,

450
00:20:43,876 --> 00:20:45,843
but I can certainly feel my age

451
00:20:45,845 --> 00:20:47,345
in the last three years.

452
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:50,881
Would you like to dance?

453
00:20:50,883 --> 00:20:52,350
Okay.

454
00:20:53,953 --> 00:20:56,887
I want someone who still
loves me for me,

455
00:20:56,889 --> 00:20:59,690
you know, when
I'm not as virile,

456
00:20:59,692 --> 00:21:02,827
when I am starting
to fall apart.

457
00:21:02,829 --> 00:21:04,729
You know, and I wouldn't mind

458
00:21:04,731 --> 00:21:06,897
falling apart with someone.

459
00:21:08,568 --> 00:21:10,001
My name is Ron.

460
00:21:10,003 --> 00:21:11,802
My name is Serena.

461
00:21:11,804 --> 00:21:13,704
So you speak English?

462
00:21:13,706 --> 00:21:15,973
And how old are you?

463
00:21:15,975 --> 00:21:18,409
It's a secret.

464
00:21:18,411 --> 00:21:20,311
Well, that's important.

465
00:21:20,313 --> 00:21:22,046
Yes, yes.

466
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:24,415
If you're 25 years
younger than me,

467
00:21:24,417 --> 00:21:27,585
then they're not gonna be
falling apart with me.

468
00:21:32,692 --> 00:21:34,859
Tell me about the woman
that you met.

469
00:21:34,861 --> 00:21:36,827
What happened when you met?

470
00:21:36,829 --> 00:21:38,663
Instant sparks.

471
00:21:38,665 --> 00:21:40,698
I can't explain it.

472
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:44,635
Even though she speaks
very little English

473
00:21:44,637 --> 00:21:49,307
and I speak no Russian,
it was just instant sparks.

474
00:21:49,309 --> 00:21:52,410
Her name's Victoria.
We met at the social.

475
00:21:52,412 --> 00:21:55,346
Danced for a while,
talked for a while.

476
00:21:55,348 --> 00:21:58,749
I never left her side
till late the next afternoon

477
00:21:58,751 --> 00:22:00,484
to go to the hotel, freshen up,

478
00:22:00,486 --> 00:22:03,087
and went back to spend
more time with her.

479
00:22:03,089 --> 00:22:05,690
In a perfect world,

480
00:22:05,692 --> 00:22:07,892
this would just keep going

481
00:22:07,894 --> 00:22:10,661
as awesome and wonderful
as it's been.

482
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:14,598
And if it keeps going
in the direction that it is,

483
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:17,768
I plan on being engaged
before I leave.

484
00:22:32,051 --> 00:22:34,118
- How are you?
- Did you sleep well?

485
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:36,921
I did, the little bit
I slept, yeah.

486
00:22:36,923 --> 00:22:38,956
Okay, guys, I'm glad to see
that you all survived.

487
00:22:38,958 --> 00:22:40,491
Odessa so far.

488
00:22:40,493 --> 00:22:43,127
So now that you have
one social under your belt,

489
00:22:43,129 --> 00:22:45,463
you have a little better idea

490
00:22:45,465 --> 00:22:48,666
how to manipulate
and maneuver in the social.

491
00:22:48,668 --> 00:22:50,935
In nikolayev,
the social will be held

492
00:22:50,937 --> 00:22:54,105
at a nightclub
that's called the illusion.

493
00:22:54,107 --> 00:22:55,706
When you're dating, you know

494
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:57,007
that could be
appropriate, right?

495
00:22:57,009 --> 00:22:58,642
You guys have fun with it

496
00:22:58,644 --> 00:23:00,644
and hopefully you'll find
that one woman

497
00:23:00,646 --> 00:23:03,581
that you can really
connect with.

498
00:23:11,157 --> 00:23:13,491
We arrive
at the social at 5:00,

499
00:23:13,493 --> 00:23:14,759
and it's jammed.

500
00:23:14,761 --> 00:23:16,927
I mean, there are women
everywhere.

501
00:23:16,929 --> 00:23:18,662
Guys are making time
in the line.

502
00:23:18,664 --> 00:23:19,830
I mean, they're
talking to the girls

503
00:23:19,832 --> 00:23:20,865
and the girls
aren't even in yet.

504
00:23:20,867 --> 00:23:22,032
They got their coats still on.

505
00:23:22,034 --> 00:23:23,768
They got one social
under their belt,

506
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:25,936
they're veterans now.
They're not rookies anymore.

507
00:23:25,938 --> 00:23:27,171
They know what they're doing.

508
00:23:27,173 --> 00:23:29,840
Ah, the beginnings
of another social.

509
00:23:32,845 --> 00:23:34,712
How do they do that?

510
00:23:36,482 --> 00:23:38,015
Did you see that?

511
00:23:39,118 --> 00:23:41,886
I've been to Ukraine

512
00:23:41,888 --> 00:23:43,754
on six different trips,

513
00:23:43,756 --> 00:23:46,791
and when I walk in
to the social,

514
00:23:46,793 --> 00:23:49,493
of course, I'm
always uncomfortable

515
00:23:49,495 --> 00:23:50,995
'cause there's a lot
of people in that room

516
00:23:50,997 --> 00:23:53,497
and there's a lot of beautiful
women in that room.

517
00:23:53,499 --> 00:23:55,733
So the hardest part for me

518
00:23:55,735 --> 00:23:57,468
is to just start
with the first one.

519
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:58,936
And I take my interpreter

520
00:23:58,938 --> 00:24:01,038
and we start walking the room.

521
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,707
There sitting at
this table by herself

522
00:24:03,709 --> 00:24:07,111
is a very tall, beautiful girl

523
00:24:07,113 --> 00:24:09,180
with long blonde hair.

524
00:24:25,031 --> 00:24:27,465
She fit all the criteria

525
00:24:27,467 --> 00:24:30,167
that I kind of went
on this trip with.

526
00:24:40,746 --> 00:24:43,614
We talked for quite a long time

527
00:24:43,616 --> 00:24:45,783
and she was
definitely interested

528
00:24:45,785 --> 00:24:48,853
in the possibility of
what it could turn into.

529
00:24:48,855 --> 00:24:51,188
Some of these guys just
haven't dated in a long time,

530
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:53,691
and these passions,
these feelings

531
00:24:53,693 --> 00:24:55,826
I don't think they've felt
for years and years.

532
00:24:55,828 --> 00:24:57,228
And all of a sudden,

533
00:24:57,230 --> 00:24:59,163
they're really just
exploring it all over again.

534
00:24:59,165 --> 00:25:02,032
� I want a girl like you �

535
00:25:02,034 --> 00:25:03,934
� who wants a boy like me �

536
00:25:03,936 --> 00:25:05,903
� who gets a girl like you �

537
00:25:05,905 --> 00:25:09,139
I'm skeptical on this.

538
00:25:09,141 --> 00:25:12,142
Having talked to some
of the translators here,

539
00:25:12,144 --> 00:25:13,844
when I've asked them,

540
00:25:13,846 --> 00:25:16,780
"tell me what percentage
of the women here

541
00:25:16,782 --> 00:25:18,682
are truly in their heart
interested

542
00:25:18,684 --> 00:25:20,251
in finding a man,
being married."

543
00:25:20,253 --> 00:25:22,620
I mean, they're giving me
some really low numbers.

544
00:25:22,622 --> 00:25:24,221
Do you have any children?

545
00:25:24,223 --> 00:25:26,857
- No.
- Okay.

546
00:25:26,859 --> 00:25:30,628
Hold on. I'm looking for
someone with no children.

547
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:33,664
I've certainly not met anyone
age appropriate for me.

548
00:25:41,841 --> 00:25:44,875
Last night, I met
a girl at a social.

549
00:25:44,877 --> 00:25:47,211
Somehow we started chatting,

550
00:25:47,213 --> 00:25:49,713
even though she
doesn't speak English.

551
00:25:49,715 --> 00:25:51,682
We ended up dancing together

552
00:25:51,684 --> 00:25:53,017
the rest of the night.

553
00:25:53,019 --> 00:25:55,185
And when we were at the club,

554
00:25:55,187 --> 00:25:57,121
she asked me on a date,

555
00:25:57,123 --> 00:25:59,323
so we have a date
tonight at 7:00.

556
00:25:59,325 --> 00:26:01,258
And her name is vitalina.

557
00:26:06,566 --> 00:26:08,866
I'm looking for
a partner, you know.

558
00:26:08,868 --> 00:26:10,768
A lover, a friend.

559
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:13,304
I've got
a great life, you know.

560
00:26:13,306 --> 00:26:15,239
There's just that
one piece missing.

561
00:26:18,144 --> 00:26:20,311
Tell her she looks
very pretty tonight.

562
00:26:25,351 --> 00:26:27,017
Thank you.

563
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:39,129
She say that she like you

564
00:26:39,131 --> 00:26:41,799
from your first meeting,

565
00:26:41,801 --> 00:26:46,604
and she say
she just want, like...

566
00:26:46,606 --> 00:26:49,974
to hold with him,
that he hold me or hug me,

567
00:26:49,976 --> 00:26:52,242
and just no talk.

568
00:26:52,244 --> 00:26:57,114
Just sit and she feel
very comfortable with you.

569
00:26:57,116 --> 00:26:58,916
Comfortable, yeah.

570
00:26:58,918 --> 00:27:01,385
So we don't need
an interpreter for that.

571
00:27:01,387 --> 00:27:03,253
- I agree with you.
- Yeah.

572
00:27:03,255 --> 00:27:04,355
I agree with you.

573
00:27:39,125 --> 00:27:40,858
I was sort of, like, nervous

574
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:44,862
because I didn't know
what to expect, yeah.

575
00:27:44,864 --> 00:27:46,764
But I could see
she's all smiles

576
00:27:46,766 --> 00:27:49,333
and things like that.

577
00:27:49,335 --> 00:27:53,003
I believe that it's good

578
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:54,838
for both Western men

579
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,774
and Ukrainian women

580
00:27:56,776 --> 00:28:00,277
to be able to explore
options elsewhere

581
00:28:00,279 --> 00:28:03,147
because it's always great

582
00:28:03,149 --> 00:28:05,049
when you can expand
your horizons

583
00:28:05,051 --> 00:28:07,685
and understand
what is right for you.

584
00:28:10,356 --> 00:28:13,057
I didn't come here
just for entertainment.

585
00:28:13,059 --> 00:28:16,093
I really want to make it
with her, you know.

586
00:28:16,095 --> 00:28:20,964
We've been talking about it
on the Internet all the time.

587
00:28:20,966 --> 00:28:24,468
I told her we'll take it
one step at a time.

588
00:28:26,939 --> 00:28:29,173
Who won? Who won?

589
00:28:29,175 --> 00:28:30,908
I don't know.

590
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,213
All right, guys.

591
00:28:36,215 --> 00:28:40,718
Well, you've now survived
two socials.

592
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,152
I congratulate all of you

593
00:28:42,154 --> 00:28:44,254
for going to
the third and final social

594
00:28:44,256 --> 00:28:45,756
here in kherson.

595
00:28:45,758 --> 00:28:47,424
It's gonna be over
before you know it.

596
00:28:47,426 --> 00:28:48,959
Nothing really matters.

597
00:28:48,961 --> 00:28:50,327
Just go up, talk to
whoever you want to talk to.

598
00:28:50,329 --> 00:28:51,895
Make something happen.

599
00:28:51,897 --> 00:28:53,430
I mean, you know,
don't sit there and be shy.

600
00:28:53,432 --> 00:28:55,099
Just go up and do it

601
00:28:55,101 --> 00:28:57,101
because you'll probably
never see her again anyway.

602
00:28:57,103 --> 00:28:58,302
She lives in the Ukraine.

603
00:28:58,304 --> 00:29:00,237
This is your opportunity.
This is it.

604
00:29:02,875 --> 00:29:06,510
It's the last city
and I'm down to one.

605
00:29:06,512 --> 00:29:08,445
To be honest,
this is probably the one

606
00:29:08,447 --> 00:29:12,082
that my eye
always came back to.

607
00:29:12,084 --> 00:29:14,251
Her name is Julia.

608
00:29:14,253 --> 00:29:16,987
She works at a travel agency.

609
00:29:16,989 --> 00:29:18,989
Incredibly beautiful.

610
00:29:18,991 --> 00:29:20,424
We've been writing
to each other

611
00:29:20,426 --> 00:29:22,826
for... it's got to be
seven, eight months now.

612
00:29:22,828 --> 00:29:25,195
We'll meet at the social.

613
00:29:25,197 --> 00:29:28,198
I'm coming to basically try
to sweep her off her feet.

614
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,900
Do you have pictures of her?

615
00:29:29,902 --> 00:29:31,468
Yeah.

616
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:34,138
How old is she?

617
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:38,475
26. She was a little bit
under my target age.

618
00:29:38,477 --> 00:29:40,410
This is the one
from the website

619
00:29:40,412 --> 00:29:42,880
where she looks like
Angelina Jolie.

620
00:29:42,882 --> 00:29:46,450
Yeah. She does.

621
00:29:46,452 --> 00:29:48,852
How can you go wrong there?

622
00:30:03,502 --> 00:30:05,936
A little nervous.

623
00:30:05,938 --> 00:30:08,071
Just waiting.

624
00:30:08,073 --> 00:30:10,174
This last
hour and a half of wait

625
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:12,342
is just driving me up a wall.

626
00:30:15,548 --> 00:30:17,414
Something a little special.

627
00:30:17,416 --> 00:30:20,284
All the other guys,
they go out and buy roses.

628
00:30:20,286 --> 00:30:23,086
I wanted to get
something that would last

629
00:30:23,088 --> 00:30:25,589
hopefully as long
as the relationship.

630
00:30:25,591 --> 00:30:31,595
So one gold rose.

631
00:30:31,597 --> 00:30:35,032
Hopefully it gets her this
and everything will be okay.

632
00:30:35,034 --> 00:30:38,001
And I'll be either
really happy or really sad.

633
00:30:41,073 --> 00:30:43,073
This is like prom for old guys.

634
00:30:43,075 --> 00:30:44,908
That's the way
I'm looking at it,

635
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:47,544
which is nice, since
I never went to prom, so...

636
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:53,050
Thank you.

637
00:31:02,127 --> 00:31:03,527
I'm sort of hoping

638
00:31:03,529 --> 00:31:06,063
to have a table off by
ourselves the whole night.

639
00:31:06,065 --> 00:31:07,598
It will have a translator

640
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,466
because she doesn't
speak English,

641
00:31:09,468 --> 00:31:11,201
I don't do Russian.

642
00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:14,638
So we can just treat that
as our first date.

643
00:31:16,475 --> 00:31:19,309
Every time I see someone with
black hair walk in the door,

644
00:31:19,311 --> 00:31:21,178
my heart goes, uh!
Oh, it's not her.

645
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:22,980
Uh! Not her.

646
00:31:22,982 --> 00:31:26,650
When I did my search, I looked
for certain specific things.

647
00:31:26,652 --> 00:31:30,087
I like women that have
black hair, blue eyes.

648
00:31:30,089 --> 00:31:32,289
People that are smart,
that are independent.

649
00:31:32,291 --> 00:31:36,159
Someone that's gonna make me
want to be a better me.

650
00:31:36,161 --> 00:31:39,930
Your climactic moment
is gonna happen any minute.

651
00:31:39,932 --> 00:31:42,099
Yeah, I'm hoping.

652
00:31:42,101 --> 00:31:45,402
When the guys come over,

653
00:31:45,404 --> 00:31:47,504
they have their own set
of expectations,

654
00:31:47,506 --> 00:31:50,107
which may be on target
and may not be on target.

655
00:31:50,109 --> 00:31:51,508
And they think, oh, gee,

656
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:54,978
I've been writing to Irina,
svitlana, Elena.

657
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:56,113
I've been writing
to all these women

658
00:31:56,115 --> 00:31:57,614
and they write to me,

659
00:31:57,616 --> 00:31:59,983
and I wrote to them,
I told them I was coming over.

660
00:31:59,985 --> 00:32:02,986
And maybe that works
and maybe that doesn't.

661
00:32:32,651 --> 00:32:36,053
Hi. Are the women
checking in with you, too?

662
00:32:36,055 --> 00:32:38,021
Only her.

663
00:32:38,023 --> 00:32:41,658
Oh, okay. No English.

664
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:42,960
Perfect.

665
00:32:50,469 --> 00:32:54,705
I thought she was going to show up.
I really did.

666
00:32:54,707 --> 00:32:57,074
So I made sure I was
staying off by myself

667
00:32:57,076 --> 00:32:59,209
because I didn't want to
have to fend off other women,

668
00:32:59,211 --> 00:33:02,212
trying to keep them away while
I'm trying to wait for her.

669
00:33:02,214 --> 00:33:04,381
Now, I wanted to come in here

670
00:33:04,383 --> 00:33:07,384
to this place
to meet this person

671
00:33:07,386 --> 00:33:10,253
and now I don't know
what's going on.

672
00:33:24,136 --> 00:33:26,169
So how are you feeling?

673
00:33:26,171 --> 00:33:29,006
Like anybody would feel.

674
00:33:29,008 --> 00:33:31,742
Definitely not good.

675
00:33:31,744 --> 00:33:33,577
So I had a conversation
with John this morning.

676
00:33:33,579 --> 00:33:36,580
I said, you know, the lady
I'm talking to online,

677
00:33:36,582 --> 00:33:39,049
the lady I'm writing to,

678
00:33:39,051 --> 00:33:42,019
works full time
in a tourist agency.

679
00:33:42,021 --> 00:33:45,555
Monday through Friday,
half a day Saturdays,

680
00:33:45,557 --> 00:33:47,657
and isn't a student.

681
00:33:47,659 --> 00:33:49,693
And the person
that Max is talking to

682
00:33:49,695 --> 00:33:51,428
is a student half time.

683
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:53,163
I said, you know, I've
been writing this lady,

684
00:33:53,165 --> 00:33:58,268
you know, almost daily
for months now.

685
00:33:58,270 --> 00:34:01,638
Email are $10 a pop
going and coming,

686
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:05,709
so I'm probably out 10 grand.

687
00:34:05,711 --> 00:34:08,078
My biggest fear
is that it was a scam.

688
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:10,547
That she's writing
to 50 or 60 guys

689
00:34:10,549 --> 00:34:12,249
and she's getting
a cut of the fees

690
00:34:12,251 --> 00:34:14,284
for the emails
going back and forth.

691
00:34:14,286 --> 00:34:15,786
John said he's concerned
about that, too,

692
00:34:15,788 --> 00:34:19,189
so he's trying to find out
what's really going on.

693
00:34:19,191 --> 00:34:21,091
As he said, you know, well,
there's other women to meet.

694
00:34:21,093 --> 00:34:22,659
I said I didn't come here
to meet other women.

695
00:34:22,661 --> 00:34:24,561
That's not what I was here for.

696
00:34:37,309 --> 00:34:42,079
I say, I can understand

697
00:34:42,081 --> 00:34:46,249
why there's such a lot
of Ukrainian dating sites,

698
00:34:46,251 --> 00:34:48,852
because the women here
are truly beautiful.

699
00:34:48,854 --> 00:34:51,855
But I've only got eyes
for mine.

700
00:35:16,615 --> 00:35:19,583
It's not easy giving
your whole life up and move.

701
00:35:19,585 --> 00:35:21,852
Really, it's not that easy.

702
00:35:21,854 --> 00:35:23,253
I live in Australia,

703
00:35:23,255 --> 00:35:25,155
and there's
a lot of opportunity.

704
00:35:25,157 --> 00:35:27,157
But then, she's got
a business here.

705
00:35:27,159 --> 00:35:30,360
She's got her family here,
you know.

706
00:35:30,362 --> 00:35:33,163
If she wants to have
a good life with me,

707
00:35:33,165 --> 00:35:35,265
I will really look after her

708
00:35:35,267 --> 00:35:37,300
and take care of her.

709
00:35:37,302 --> 00:35:39,803
So she's got to decide
what she wants to do.

710
00:35:46,245 --> 00:35:47,811
Max just called me and told me

711
00:35:47,813 --> 00:35:51,481
that she'd be down there at
5:00 in the lobby, so...

712
00:35:53,252 --> 00:35:55,919
They finally
got ahold of Julia,

713
00:35:55,921 --> 00:35:58,255
and she is supposed
to be coming here

714
00:35:58,257 --> 00:36:00,590
in about half an hour, hour,

715
00:36:00,592 --> 00:36:02,592
for our first date.

716
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:07,297
I have to go in there

717
00:36:07,299 --> 00:36:10,433
approaching it like she's
honest and all that

718
00:36:10,435 --> 00:36:14,204
and hoping that
I'm not being screwed.

719
00:36:14,206 --> 00:36:16,873
So...

720
00:36:16,875 --> 00:36:18,775
And it's been hours.

721
00:36:18,777 --> 00:36:21,211
I've been sitting here thinking
the same thing over and over.

722
00:36:21,213 --> 00:36:23,246
How do I know?

723
00:36:23,248 --> 00:36:25,682
How do you know?
How do you tell?

724
00:36:31,757 --> 00:36:33,857
- Hi.
- How you doing?

725
00:36:33,859 --> 00:36:35,625
Welcome.

726
00:36:35,627 --> 00:36:38,562
Sorry.

727
00:36:38,564 --> 00:36:41,865
We've been writing for about
seven, eight months now.

728
00:36:41,867 --> 00:36:43,867
I was wondering
what your feeling is

729
00:36:43,869 --> 00:36:45,569
on the relationship.

730
00:36:54,646 --> 00:36:57,214
And what do you say?

731
00:36:57,216 --> 00:36:58,982
We've been writing for so long,

732
00:36:58,984 --> 00:37:00,650
I was hoping that we'd
be able to move on.

733
00:37:00,652 --> 00:37:02,352
I came here to see you.

734
00:37:02,354 --> 00:37:04,321
It's the only reason I came,

735
00:37:04,323 --> 00:37:07,490
was to see if
you wanted to move

736
00:37:07,492 --> 00:37:09,559
maybe further
in the relationship.

737
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:11,228
Do you feel like
she was the woman

738
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:12,295
that was writing to you?

739
00:37:12,297 --> 00:37:15,665
I had some questions and doubts

740
00:37:15,667 --> 00:37:17,467
because the pictures
I showed her

741
00:37:17,469 --> 00:37:20,570
were pictures of things
that she's seen before...

742
00:37:20,572 --> 00:37:23,673
the house, the yard, my work.

743
00:37:25,844 --> 00:37:26,977
People in black.

744
00:37:28,814 --> 00:37:29,980
This is actually pictures

745
00:37:29,982 --> 00:37:31,915
from the last shuttle launch.

746
00:37:31,917 --> 00:37:34,751
Wow.

747
00:37:34,753 --> 00:37:36,886
If she wasn't the one
writing the letters,

748
00:37:36,888 --> 00:37:38,989
does it matter?

749
00:37:38,991 --> 00:37:42,325
It would have

750
00:37:42,327 --> 00:37:44,794
and probably should.

751
00:37:44,796 --> 00:37:47,564
But what I don't want to do
is for me to overthink it

752
00:37:47,566 --> 00:37:50,267
and cause the problem
that isn't really there.

753
00:37:50,269 --> 00:37:54,004
I guess, honestly, I can't get
this girl out of my mind.

754
00:37:54,006 --> 00:37:57,941
Something that's special
and beautiful and unique

755
00:37:57,943 --> 00:37:59,943
shouldn't be alone,
they should come in pairs.

756
00:37:59,945 --> 00:38:01,378
And I was hoping...

757
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:03,480
I may not be,
you know, beautiful

758
00:38:03,482 --> 00:38:06,049
and that unique, but I'm hoping

759
00:38:06,051 --> 00:38:07,817
that maybe we could be a pair.

760
00:38:09,821 --> 00:38:11,755
You are very inspiring.

761
00:38:20,399 --> 00:38:21,865
Yeah.

762
00:38:21,867 --> 00:38:24,634
And we'll have them, too.

763
00:38:24,636 --> 00:38:27,537
Do you want to come to
America and marry me?

764
00:38:33,545 --> 00:38:35,979
Let's move into this direction.

765
00:38:35,981 --> 00:38:37,414
Okay.

766
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:42,952
Can I, please?

767
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:47,824
So, what was your
impressions of tonight?

768
00:38:49,561 --> 00:38:50,894
I think it went really well.

769
00:38:50,896 --> 00:38:52,562
I think I'm engaged now,

770
00:38:52,564 --> 00:38:55,732
so I'd have to say
it's going really well.

771
00:38:56,935 --> 00:38:58,768
Did you get her email address?

772
00:38:58,770 --> 00:39:01,037
No. Gotta still go
through the service

773
00:39:01,039 --> 00:39:02,939
because I need to have
the translations.

774
00:39:02,941 --> 00:39:04,908
So we'll go through that.

775
00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:06,343
I can ask her through that

776
00:39:06,345 --> 00:39:07,977
if she wants to give me
her email address.

777
00:39:07,979 --> 00:39:10,413
I don't know if she has one.

778
00:39:10,415 --> 00:39:12,549
Didn't even think to ask.

779
00:39:12,551 --> 00:39:15,051
A little preoccupied.

780
00:39:15,053 --> 00:39:16,753
You're engaged.

781
00:39:16,755 --> 00:39:19,989
I'm engaged.

782
00:39:24,496 --> 00:39:26,663
I want to settle down again
with a good girl,

783
00:39:26,665 --> 00:39:29,933
and I think svitlana
is a good girl.

784
00:39:29,935 --> 00:39:33,136
We had a wonderful time
in Kiev.

785
00:39:33,138 --> 00:39:34,804
I asked her
do you wanna marry me?

786
00:39:34,806 --> 00:39:36,706
And she said yes,
and that's it.

787
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:40,643
So we're going
to get married in Bali.

788
00:39:40,645 --> 00:39:43,380
I'm gonna try and I'll
give it my best shot.

789
00:39:43,382 --> 00:39:46,850
If it depends on me,
I will make it work.

790
00:39:49,421 --> 00:39:51,488
I'm very impressed
with the tour.

791
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:55,592
I think for the cost,
you get a lot.

792
00:39:55,594 --> 00:39:59,596
Next Christmas, I would
like to be either married

793
00:39:59,598 --> 00:40:01,765
or real close to being married.

794
00:40:01,767 --> 00:40:03,800
They're not
that fucking friendly.

795
00:40:03,802 --> 00:40:05,168
They're not.

796
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:08,872
Now that I'm leaving,
that's how I feel.

797
00:40:08,874 --> 00:40:11,875
No, I don't think
most of the people here

798
00:40:11,877 --> 00:40:13,743
like Americans particularly.

799
00:40:13,745 --> 00:40:16,513
You take a woman
from the Ukraine,

800
00:40:16,515 --> 00:40:19,582
and you have to overcome
the language barrier

801
00:40:19,584 --> 00:40:21,151
if she doesn't speak
excellent English.

802
00:40:21,153 --> 00:40:22,852
More importantly,
you have to overcome

803
00:40:22,854 --> 00:40:25,021
the cultural difference.

804
00:40:25,023 --> 00:40:26,823
But would I come back
to the Ukraine

805
00:40:26,825 --> 00:40:30,427
or anywhere
to look for a bride? No.

806
00:40:31,563 --> 00:40:33,730
I met one girl
that I really liked.

807
00:40:33,732 --> 00:40:35,465
So we probably spent about

808
00:40:35,467 --> 00:40:40,036
a total of three hours
actually face to face.

809
00:41:01,827 --> 00:41:04,828
I was only hoping
that this would happen.

810
00:41:04,830 --> 00:41:07,764
I never dreamed
that it actually would.

811
00:41:09,134 --> 00:41:10,767
Yeah.

812
00:41:12,637 --> 00:41:15,071
I really don't want to leave.

813
00:41:15,073 --> 00:41:17,073
Kind of have to.

814
00:41:17,075 --> 00:41:19,943
It's really rough
leaving Victoria here.

815
00:41:19,945 --> 00:41:24,514
I'll try to keep in
constant contact with her.

816
00:41:24,516 --> 00:41:28,151
Hopefully Skype a lot,
talk on the phone.

817
00:41:28,153 --> 00:41:29,853
Anything else you want to say

818
00:41:29,855 --> 00:41:32,822
before you say goodbye
to Victoria?

819
00:41:35,527 --> 00:41:38,228
Too much. No, I can't.

820
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:39,896
You pretty torn up?

821
00:41:39,898 --> 00:41:41,764
Yeah, very.

822
00:41:41,766 --> 00:41:43,166
So are you gonna be okay?

823
00:41:45,003 --> 00:41:47,036
I don't know. We'll see.

824
00:41:49,941 --> 00:41:51,574
It's so hard to tell you

825
00:41:51,576 --> 00:41:53,209
who I think will be successful,

826
00:41:53,211 --> 00:41:55,044
because, to me,
if someone comes over

827
00:41:55,046 --> 00:41:57,247
and has a wonderful time,
it opens their eyes,

828
00:41:57,249 --> 00:41:59,148
that's a successful time.

829
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:01,217
But as far as finding
that one woman

830
00:42:01,219 --> 00:42:04,020
and getting married, if you
define that as success,

831
00:42:04,022 --> 00:42:05,688
that's really hard to tell

832
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:07,690
because this is real life.

833
00:42:07,692 --> 00:42:09,158
This isn't controlled.

834
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:11,261
They're all adults
we're introducing,

835
00:42:11,263 --> 00:42:13,162
and whatever happens happens.

836
00:42:47,332 --> 00:42:51,067
It's been almost three
months since I've seen vica.

837
00:42:51,069 --> 00:42:53,770
When I left Odessa,

838
00:42:53,772 --> 00:42:55,772
I knew we had
a great connection

839
00:42:55,774 --> 00:42:59,909
and, you know, we obviously
liked each other very much.

840
00:42:59,911 --> 00:43:03,680
You know, I can't say
I was in love.

841
00:43:03,682 --> 00:43:07,750
I knew I liked her a lot.

842
00:43:07,752 --> 00:43:10,820
I've never felt that right
away with anyone else,

843
00:43:10,822 --> 00:43:12,956
and I didn't want to lose that.

844
00:43:12,958 --> 00:43:15,258
Come on, get up.

845
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:18,261
After coming back home,

846
00:43:18,263 --> 00:43:20,997
I did not know
I was in love with her

847
00:43:20,999 --> 00:43:24,233
until I seen the video
that afa had

848
00:43:24,235 --> 00:43:26,769
on their website
from December tour.

849
00:43:26,771 --> 00:43:28,004
Come on.

850
00:43:29,307 --> 00:43:31,741
First time I seen it,
I balled my eyes out.

851
00:43:31,743 --> 00:43:34,243
That was when I knew.

852
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:40,083
It just brought back everything

853
00:43:40,085 --> 00:43:42,785
'cause I knew exactly
what she was doing.

854
00:43:42,787 --> 00:43:44,754
She was singing to me
in Russian.

855
00:43:45,957 --> 00:43:48,024
It brought that back instantly.

856
00:43:50,161 --> 00:43:53,262
I still can't watch it.

857
00:43:56,101 --> 00:43:57,900
I'll be there
in one week today.

858
00:43:57,902 --> 00:44:00,937
I can't hardly sleep.

859
00:44:13,284 --> 00:44:17,387
I've been to Ukraine
on six different trips

860
00:44:17,389 --> 00:44:20,123
over the course
of about nine years.

861
00:44:20,125 --> 00:44:24,127
I've probably dated
35 to 50 women

862
00:44:24,129 --> 00:44:26,396
that I met there,

863
00:44:26,398 --> 00:44:29,365
and all indications are
that I have found someone

864
00:44:29,367 --> 00:44:32,001
that is truly serious

865
00:44:32,003 --> 00:44:34,771
about building
a committed relationship

866
00:44:34,773 --> 00:44:36,939
and coming to the U.S.

867
00:44:36,941 --> 00:44:40,009
So I leave
on my seventh journey

868
00:44:40,011 --> 00:44:41,344
in two days,

869
00:44:41,346 --> 00:44:44,213
and we will be back together

870
00:44:44,215 --> 00:44:46,382
in about a week and a half.

871
00:45:15,847 --> 00:45:17,346
For inna.

872
00:45:20,418 --> 00:45:23,319
I got her this engagement ring.

873
00:45:49,814 --> 00:45:54,050
I can't wait to see you
at the airport.

874
00:46:05,530 --> 00:46:06,996
I agree.

875
00:46:06,998 --> 00:46:09,866
I'll miss you until I see you

876
00:46:09,868 --> 00:46:11,400
at the airport.

877
00:46:11,402 --> 00:46:14,003
Okay. Bye-bye.

878
00:46:14,005 --> 00:46:15,304
Goodbye.

879
00:46:18,543 --> 00:46:20,843
I really am looking forward

880
00:46:20,845 --> 00:46:24,881
to coming through
that gate at the airport

881
00:46:24,883 --> 00:46:28,017
and looking into her eyes again

882
00:46:28,019 --> 00:46:31,354
and reconnect physically.

883
00:46:32,791 --> 00:46:35,324
I just want to hold her.

884
00:46:54,579 --> 00:46:57,346
- Robert.
- Hey, sweetheart.

885
00:46:58,850 --> 00:47:00,483
How are you?

886
00:47:00,485 --> 00:47:03,119
Oh.

887
00:47:05,223 --> 00:47:07,456
I came back
and vita was available.

888
00:47:07,458 --> 00:47:09,492
She would meet me anytime.

889
00:47:09,494 --> 00:47:10,960
I said can we Skype
here, can we Skype...

890
00:47:10,962 --> 00:47:12,295
she was available.

891
00:47:15,033 --> 00:47:16,399
What did she say?

892
00:47:16,401 --> 00:47:17,967
She's just laughing.

893
00:47:17,969 --> 00:47:19,435
It's refreshing.

894
00:47:19,437 --> 00:47:22,538
The innocence that she has,

895
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:26,175
it's just really made
an impression on me.

896
00:47:26,177 --> 00:47:27,343
There's a lot of affection.

897
00:47:27,345 --> 00:47:29,145
There was immediately.

898
00:47:29,147 --> 00:47:31,514
When you're walking down
the street arm in arm,

899
00:47:31,516 --> 00:47:34,183
who needs to speak
the same language, you know?

900
00:47:34,185 --> 00:47:36,252
So when I came back,

901
00:47:36,254 --> 00:47:38,321
within the first week or two,

902
00:47:38,323 --> 00:47:41,524
I thought, "this actually
may work out."

903
00:47:41,526 --> 00:47:43,359
And it wasn't
too long after that

904
00:47:43,361 --> 00:47:46,462
I decided that I was
going back to see her.

905
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:50,433
And here's my lovely miss vita.

906
00:47:50,435 --> 00:47:53,469
I went back with the idea

907
00:47:53,471 --> 00:47:54,904
that I was gonna
ask her to marry me

908
00:47:54,906 --> 00:47:56,539
and get engaged.

909
00:47:58,443 --> 00:48:01,177
I think within
the first hour of being there,

910
00:48:01,179 --> 00:48:03,512
I proposed to her, you know.

911
00:48:03,514 --> 00:48:06,415
She said yes.

912
00:48:06,417 --> 00:48:08,517
Logic would have said
wait a few days.

913
00:48:08,519 --> 00:48:09,886
You never know.

914
00:48:09,888 --> 00:48:13,956
The hell with logic.
It felt right.

915
00:48:13,958 --> 00:48:18,127
And if anything, that made
the rest of the eight days

916
00:48:18,129 --> 00:48:19,562
that much better.

917
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:24,367
She called her mom,
told her mom.

918
00:48:24,369 --> 00:48:27,603
And then I asked that I would
like to meet her parents.

919
00:48:27,605 --> 00:48:31,240
Probably the most nervous
on the whole trip

920
00:48:31,242 --> 00:48:33,209
is when I met her parents.

921
00:48:55,633 --> 00:48:57,500
I love you, Bob.

922
00:48:57,502 --> 00:48:59,602
I love you, too, vitalina.

923
00:49:12,650 --> 00:49:16,085
So what's the next step?

924
00:49:16,087 --> 00:49:19,989
It's the application process
for the fianc�e visa.

925
00:49:19,991 --> 00:49:22,558
Eventually, she'll have
an interview with the embassy

926
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:24,994
where she'll
have to provide documents.

927
00:49:24,996 --> 00:49:28,397
Once you file,
it's just waiting.

928
00:49:28,399 --> 00:49:32,668
It's gonna be
a long six months.

929
00:49:32,670 --> 00:49:34,236
Hopefully it works out with us.

930
00:49:34,238 --> 00:49:36,138
If it doesn't, it doesn't.

931
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:38,641
I hope it does, I think
it is, but it may not.

932
00:49:38,643 --> 00:49:40,343
You never know.

933
00:49:51,990 --> 00:49:55,024
Two days before we got married,

934
00:49:55,026 --> 00:49:57,226
I got an email that says,

935
00:49:57,228 --> 00:49:59,295
my name is alexy.
You do not know me,

936
00:49:59,297 --> 00:50:01,263
but I'm working with
svitlana for okina,

937
00:50:01,265 --> 00:50:03,466
so I know her very well

938
00:50:03,468 --> 00:50:05,735
and heard a lot about you,

939
00:50:05,737 --> 00:50:07,536
so I want to warn you.

940
00:50:07,538 --> 00:50:11,107
Svitlana works with
illegal dating agency,

941
00:50:11,109 --> 00:50:14,243
which by fraud lures
foreigners to Ukraine

942
00:50:14,245 --> 00:50:16,178
for dating beautiful women

943
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:19,248
and then takes all
their money. Bleed white.

944
00:50:19,250 --> 00:50:21,650
I know that you have planned
a wedding in Bali.

945
00:50:21,652 --> 00:50:23,753
She will fly to Bali
for your money.

946
00:50:23,755 --> 00:50:27,390
She will bring the borrowed
wedding dress as proof.

947
00:50:27,392 --> 00:50:30,793
But I can assure you
the wedding will not happen.

948
00:50:40,738 --> 00:50:43,272
I told svitlana
about the bad email

949
00:50:43,274 --> 00:50:49,178
that I got from Kiev,
and she's quite shocked.

950
00:50:49,180 --> 00:50:51,080
I suppose it's somebody

951
00:50:51,082 --> 00:50:53,616
that don't really want her
to get married.

952
00:50:53,618 --> 00:50:57,420
The letter was saying,
you know, I'm just a donkey,

953
00:50:57,422 --> 00:50:59,188
and they'll just
use me, you know.

954
00:50:59,190 --> 00:51:00,489
I don't know.

955
00:51:00,491 --> 00:51:02,124
I'm just very
stressed out, you know.

956
00:51:02,126 --> 00:51:05,594
Already I can feel it.
It's building up again.

957
00:51:11,069 --> 00:51:13,636
I was waiting for anything
to happen, you know,

958
00:51:13,638 --> 00:51:15,771
but nothing happened.

959
00:51:15,773 --> 00:51:20,342
We went to the Australian
embassy in denpasar

960
00:51:20,344 --> 00:51:22,178
and we did the paperwork

961
00:51:22,180 --> 00:51:24,213
and she was happy
to do everything.

962
00:51:24,215 --> 00:51:28,084
You know, I mean, she could
have bailed out anytime.

963
00:51:28,086 --> 00:51:30,086
She did not.

964
00:51:30,088 --> 00:51:32,354
We can't get into
every person's head.

965
00:51:32,356 --> 00:51:36,425
We don't know their motives.

966
00:51:36,427 --> 00:51:38,360
We don't know how
they're going to feel

967
00:51:38,362 --> 00:51:39,862
about this particular person,

968
00:51:39,864 --> 00:51:42,665
how they're going to behave
in that relationship.

969
00:51:42,667 --> 00:51:45,734
It's all basically
your responsibility.

970
00:51:45,736 --> 00:51:51,707
And your responsibility is to try
to build a real relationship.

971
00:52:00,751 --> 00:52:02,651
We got through.

972
00:52:02,653 --> 00:52:05,121
We got married and that's it.

973
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:11,894
There's a temporary
visitors visa

974
00:52:11,896 --> 00:52:15,598
where she can come over
in a matter of three months,

975
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:18,601
and I've got to apply for that.

976
00:52:18,603 --> 00:52:23,405
So tomorrow we're going
our separate ways again.

977
00:52:29,814 --> 00:52:31,881
How were you feeling
on your way home?

978
00:52:31,883 --> 00:52:33,649
Mixed feelings.

979
00:52:33,651 --> 00:52:36,619
I mean, sort of good
that, you know,

980
00:52:36,621 --> 00:52:41,390
I met her and she was
a very attractive lady.

981
00:52:41,392 --> 00:52:42,758
Thinking that maybe
something's going to happen,

982
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:45,394
but still had that
nagging feeling

983
00:52:45,396 --> 00:52:48,397
that something was wrong.

984
00:52:50,201 --> 00:52:53,235
But you left thinking
you were engaged.

985
00:52:53,237 --> 00:52:56,405
I left thinking that we
were gonna get married.

986
00:52:56,407 --> 00:52:58,641
When I got back,

987
00:52:58,643 --> 00:53:00,910
we were corresponding
very, very frequently,

988
00:53:00,912 --> 00:53:05,314
but every time I would
ask her something personal,

989
00:53:05,316 --> 00:53:08,951
she just never answered
the question,

990
00:53:08,953 --> 00:53:12,288
so it really started
bothering me.

991
00:53:12,290 --> 00:53:13,822
Eventually I just gave up.

992
00:53:13,824 --> 00:53:15,591
I said, listen, you either
gotta answer the questions

993
00:53:15,593 --> 00:53:16,892
or that's it, I'm done.

994
00:53:16,894 --> 00:53:18,494
I don't want to talk
to you anymore.

995
00:53:18,496 --> 00:53:20,896
So she sent me one final letter

996
00:53:20,898 --> 00:53:22,731
saying that
she was hurt, you know,

997
00:53:22,733 --> 00:53:24,700
I wasn't the person
she thought I was.

998
00:53:24,702 --> 00:53:28,337
I was like, well, okay.

999
00:53:28,339 --> 00:53:31,640
It was over.

1000
00:53:31,642 --> 00:53:33,576
So why did you propose to her

1001
00:53:33,578 --> 00:53:35,544
knowing that
something was wrong?

1002
00:53:35,546 --> 00:53:40,382
What was I gonna lose
at that point?

1003
00:53:40,384 --> 00:53:44,353
You don't think that he
was mislead or scammed?

1004
00:53:44,355 --> 00:53:48,524
I don't think so, but
I'm not 100% sure yet.

1005
00:53:48,526 --> 00:53:49,959
You know, I have my doubts.

1006
00:53:49,961 --> 00:53:52,361
So we removed the woman
from the site.

1007
00:53:52,363 --> 00:53:54,863
We have taken her off.

1008
00:53:54,865 --> 00:53:56,365
You know, if she wasn't legit,

1009
00:53:56,367 --> 00:53:57,933
he still hasn't made
anything right by me.

1010
00:53:57,935 --> 00:53:59,468
I spent thousands
of dollars, you know,

1011
00:53:59,470 --> 00:54:01,337
just for the trip,

1012
00:54:01,339 --> 00:54:05,541
the letter translations
and photos.

1013
00:54:05,543 --> 00:54:08,577
Thousands of dollars
out of pocket for this.

1014
00:54:08,579 --> 00:54:11,947
All I can say is that
we worry about us.

1015
00:54:11,949 --> 00:54:13,582
We worry about
a foreign affair,

1016
00:54:13,584 --> 00:54:15,417
and we always try to do

1017
00:54:15,419 --> 00:54:17,786
the best we possibly can
for our clients.

1018
00:54:17,788 --> 00:54:19,288
We always try to act ethically.

1019
00:54:19,290 --> 00:54:20,489
If we find a problem,

1020
00:54:20,491 --> 00:54:22,391
we try to work to
resolve the problem.

1021
00:54:22,393 --> 00:54:23,626
There's always
gonna be problems,

1022
00:54:23,628 --> 00:54:25,995
but I think the measure
of the company

1023
00:54:25,997 --> 00:54:27,896
is how the company
deals with the problems.

1024
00:54:30,968 --> 00:54:36,272
Well, I'm in vienna right now.

1025
00:54:36,274 --> 00:54:38,974
We'll be boarding here
shortly, going to Odessa.

1026
00:54:38,976 --> 00:54:42,311
Pretty excited.

1027
00:54:42,313 --> 00:54:43,946
Can't wait to see you, vica.

1028
00:54:46,684 --> 00:54:48,617
Many people just assume

1029
00:54:48,619 --> 00:54:50,653
that women from other countries

1030
00:54:50,655 --> 00:54:53,789
are just looking to get into
America for a green card.

1031
00:54:53,791 --> 00:54:55,691
And after money.

1032
00:54:55,693 --> 00:54:57,693
I believe there might be a few
people out there like that.

1033
00:54:57,695 --> 00:54:59,495
But I think the majority
of the people

1034
00:54:59,497 --> 00:55:02,698
that actually going through the
process are fairly serious.

1035
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:05,000
They're looking for love.

1036
00:55:08,406 --> 00:55:09,405
Hello.

1037
00:55:09,407 --> 00:55:11,740
Pretty!

1038
00:55:11,742 --> 00:55:14,610
Look what vica made me.
Balloons.

1039
00:55:17,948 --> 00:55:20,449
Vica. Vica wash clothes.

1040
00:55:20,451 --> 00:55:23,352
No, no. Please, no.

1041
00:55:25,423 --> 00:55:27,656
I disgusting here, okay?

1042
00:55:27,658 --> 00:55:28,991
Oh, okay. Okay. Okay.

1043
00:55:34,031 --> 00:55:38,801
Well, this is my
third day here with vica.

1044
00:55:38,803 --> 00:55:42,771
I don't know what to say.

1045
00:55:42,773 --> 00:55:44,773
Not quite as I expected,
you know.

1046
00:55:44,775 --> 00:55:48,410
I thought everything
would be hunky-dory,

1047
00:55:48,412 --> 00:55:52,414
and I think everything's
gonna be all right.

1048
00:55:52,416 --> 00:55:55,684
I guess I...

1049
00:55:55,686 --> 00:55:58,620
For some reason, something
just doesn't seem right,

1050
00:55:58,622 --> 00:56:02,524
but I think everything's
gonna be all right.

1051
00:56:02,526 --> 00:56:03,992
I, uh...

1052
00:56:05,796 --> 00:56:08,397
I guess
I don't know what to say.

1053
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:18,073
On the last day,
early in the morning,

1054
00:56:18,075 --> 00:56:20,109
somebody was banging
on the windows.

1055
00:56:20,111 --> 00:56:21,577
One was a police officer.

1056
00:56:21,579 --> 00:56:24,113
The other one was a loan shark.

1057
00:56:24,115 --> 00:56:26,415
The police officer explained

1058
00:56:26,417 --> 00:56:29,118
that she owed 4,000,

1059
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:33,122
and he said if we
didn't pay it right away,

1060
00:56:33,124 --> 00:56:34,890
she'd have to go to jail.

1061
00:56:34,892 --> 00:56:37,159
And I said, well,
I don't have 4,000.

1062
00:56:37,161 --> 00:56:40,462
He said, well,
what do you have?

1063
00:56:40,464 --> 00:56:42,531
I said, well, I have
a couple hundred bucks.

1064
00:56:42,533 --> 00:56:44,967
And he said, if you give us
a couple hundred dollars,

1065
00:56:44,969 --> 00:56:46,468
we won't put her in jail.

1066
00:56:46,470 --> 00:56:47,936
So I just kind of
agreed with him

1067
00:56:47,938 --> 00:56:51,707
to make sure that I would
get to the airport on time.

1068
00:56:51,709 --> 00:56:55,110
I was hoping
to formally get engaged,

1069
00:56:55,112 --> 00:56:58,547
but everything
kind of seemed fishy,

1070
00:56:58,549 --> 00:57:00,749
so I decided not to.

1071
00:57:03,554 --> 00:57:07,623
It's 4:40 here in brisbane,

1072
00:57:07,625 --> 00:57:11,427
and it is 8:41 Ukraine time.

1073
00:57:11,429 --> 00:57:14,797
They don't really make
a specific time

1074
00:57:14,799 --> 00:57:17,566
for me to chat on Skype,

1075
00:57:17,568 --> 00:57:21,136
and that's why I get tired,
really tired,

1076
00:57:21,138 --> 00:57:24,506
because I sit long
hours here, you know,

1077
00:57:24,508 --> 00:57:26,041
waiting for them to chat to me.

1078
00:57:26,043 --> 00:57:28,877
Do you feel like she's
avoiding your calls at all?

1079
00:57:28,879 --> 00:57:30,612
- No, I don't think so.
- No?

1080
00:57:30,614 --> 00:57:31,914
I don't think so. Uh-uh.

1081
00:57:31,916 --> 00:57:35,117
No, when I get through,
she'll talk to me.

1082
00:57:35,119 --> 00:57:38,921
How long has it been
since you talked to her?

1083
00:57:38,923 --> 00:57:44,560
Not... before the wedding.

1084
00:57:52,002 --> 00:57:53,535
Who's this?

1085
00:57:53,537 --> 00:57:55,003
Cat. It's Lisa.

1086
00:57:55,005 --> 00:57:57,139
My cat.

1087
00:58:43,554 --> 00:58:47,189
We all want to believe
in something better.

1088
00:58:47,191 --> 00:58:49,725
We want to believe
that it's for real.

1089
00:58:49,727 --> 00:58:52,561
We want to believe that
it's gonna work out.

1090
00:58:52,563 --> 00:58:56,832
And so this is why
they continue with that,

1091
00:58:56,834 --> 00:59:00,302
because they kind of have already
investment and attachment.

1092
00:59:08,612 --> 00:59:11,046
I have a Skype
appointment today.

1093
00:59:11,048 --> 00:59:13,315
Busy.

1094
00:59:13,317 --> 00:59:17,719
Busy. She's busy on the phone.

1095
00:59:17,721 --> 00:59:19,655
I'll try again.

1096
00:59:21,892 --> 00:59:24,293
I like to be in control.

1097
00:59:24,295 --> 00:59:27,195
I like to be
in charge of a situation.

1098
00:59:27,197 --> 00:59:29,231
Then I know what I can do,
what's my next step,

1099
00:59:29,233 --> 00:59:31,099
and that's how I plan my life.

1100
00:59:31,101 --> 00:59:34,836
And I feel like
I cannot control it now

1101
00:59:34,838 --> 00:59:36,238
because I've got no means

1102
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:38,307
of communicating
with her properly.

1103
00:59:38,309 --> 00:59:40,976
Do you feel like
you're actually married?

1104
00:59:40,978 --> 00:59:42,844
That's the worst part.

1105
00:59:42,846 --> 00:59:44,813
I don't feel like it, no,

1106
00:59:44,815 --> 00:59:46,281
because there's not really

1107
00:59:46,283 --> 00:59:49,217
a lot of communication
between us.

1108
00:59:49,219 --> 00:59:52,120
There was no intimacy
between us.

1109
00:59:52,122 --> 00:59:53,722
What do you mean?

1110
00:59:53,724 --> 00:59:56,658
No sex, nothing. Nothing.

1111
01:00:18,782 --> 01:00:22,184
The fianc�e visa is at
least a six month process,

1112
01:00:22,186 --> 01:00:23,719
sometimes even eight months,

1113
01:00:23,721 --> 01:00:25,887
and during that time,
a lot's gonna happen.

1114
01:00:25,889 --> 01:00:28,790
They do a criminal background
check and a medical.

1115
01:00:28,792 --> 01:00:31,393
And they're looking for things
like tuberculosis or aids,

1116
01:00:31,395 --> 01:00:32,961
things like that
that would prevent her

1117
01:00:32,963 --> 01:00:34,243
from coming
to the United States.

1118
01:02:49,066 --> 01:02:52,167
It's everything incredible.

1119
01:02:52,169 --> 01:02:53,835
Everything's bigger?

1120
01:02:53,837 --> 01:02:55,370
Bigger, yeah.

1121
01:02:55,372 --> 01:02:57,439
Big trucks, big houses,
big supermarkets.

1122
01:02:57,441 --> 01:02:59,040
Big love.

1123
01:02:59,042 --> 01:03:00,375
Yeah.

1124
01:03:06,150 --> 01:03:08,016
Went to uvalde this weekend

1125
01:03:08,018 --> 01:03:14,022
with the main purpose of
introducing inna to my family

1126
01:03:14,024 --> 01:03:18,093
and showing her a little bit
of the town where I'm from

1127
01:03:18,095 --> 01:03:21,530
and getting her to
actually see and experience

1128
01:03:21,532 --> 01:03:25,367
some of the things I've
been telling her about.

1129
01:03:38,849 --> 01:03:40,816
- You okay?
- Yes.

1130
01:03:47,291 --> 01:03:51,259
How did your parents feel
about you coming over here?

1131
01:03:52,529 --> 01:03:57,966
What they think, my parents?

1132
01:03:57,968 --> 01:04:00,335
Yeah. Was it... I'm sure
it was very hard for them.

1133
01:04:00,337 --> 01:04:01,870
Yeah, of course.

1134
01:04:01,872 --> 01:04:07,008
My mom feels sad. Very cry.

1135
01:04:07,010 --> 01:04:09,344
And when we were
both in Ukraine,

1136
01:04:09,346 --> 01:04:14,416
just when we talk about this,

1137
01:04:14,418 --> 01:04:15,951
always cry.

1138
01:04:15,953 --> 01:04:18,854
And when I go, it's too much.

1139
01:04:18,856 --> 01:04:20,989
It was very difficult,
of course.

1140
01:04:20,991 --> 01:04:24,226
I don't imagine that...

1141
01:04:24,228 --> 01:04:27,429
I didn't imagine that
it was so difficult.

1142
01:04:27,431 --> 01:04:29,431
Oh, I was so backward.

1143
01:04:29,433 --> 01:04:31,433
I grew up in a very small town,

1144
01:04:31,435 --> 01:04:34,903
and I was scared to death
of the world.

1145
01:04:34,905 --> 01:04:40,141
I couldn't have gone
to some other country.

1146
01:04:47,451 --> 01:04:50,652
Anyone that would
make the effort

1147
01:04:50,654 --> 01:04:52,420
to come to the United States

1148
01:04:52,422 --> 01:04:55,557
from a country like Ukraine,

1149
01:04:55,559 --> 01:04:57,659
it's gotta be hard.

1150
01:05:00,397 --> 01:05:05,400
Something really driving
them to want to do that,

1151
01:05:05,402 --> 01:05:09,404
to leave behind
their family, the home,

1152
01:05:09,406 --> 01:05:12,540
the only home they've known,
all the familiarity.

1153
01:05:17,114 --> 01:05:19,681
Motivation can be either
positive or negative,

1154
01:05:19,683 --> 01:05:23,151
and, you know, fortunately

1155
01:05:23,153 --> 01:05:26,521
all that I've experienced

1156
01:05:26,523 --> 01:05:28,690
that she's here for
all the right reasons.

1157
01:05:32,262 --> 01:05:35,530
He's showing us
that video of her family,

1158
01:05:35,532 --> 01:05:39,601
our families are not that
much different, you know.

1159
01:05:39,603 --> 01:05:42,037
I can see they were doing

1160
01:05:42,039 --> 01:05:43,505
the same kinds of things we do

1161
01:05:43,507 --> 01:05:46,341
and it's kind of
the same place, you know.

1162
01:05:46,343 --> 01:05:50,979
People are more alike
than they are diverse,

1163
01:05:50,981 --> 01:05:56,484
so it's kind of
two worlds together.

1164
01:06:00,057 --> 01:06:02,157
It's a very big challenge

1165
01:06:02,159 --> 01:06:06,061
and it will take constant work,

1166
01:06:06,063 --> 01:06:10,265
but so is every other
relationship.

1167
01:06:13,136 --> 01:06:17,973
Just as you get older,
you have new challenges,

1168
01:06:17,975 --> 01:06:20,041
but you don't expect it.

1169
01:06:22,646 --> 01:06:27,382
I think that people are old enough
to make up their own minds,

1170
01:06:27,384 --> 01:06:29,651
and they should be able
to decide for themselves

1171
01:06:29,653 --> 01:06:31,419
what they want to do
with their lives.

1172
01:06:31,421 --> 01:06:33,388
It's their business.

1173
01:06:34,992 --> 01:06:38,159
I wouldn't intrude on that
one way or another.

1174
01:06:40,497 --> 01:06:42,664
So the flags are up
for Memorial Day,

1175
01:06:42,666 --> 01:06:45,066
which is in about a week.

1176
01:06:45,068 --> 01:06:47,235
I want to take a picture.

1177
01:06:47,237 --> 01:06:48,570
With the flags?

1178
01:06:48,572 --> 01:06:50,739
Yeah. Yeah. Just do it quick.

1179
01:06:50,741 --> 01:06:52,507
One, two, three.

1180
01:06:52,509 --> 01:06:55,276
One of my biggest fears

1181
01:06:55,278 --> 01:06:58,313
is this whole thing
not working out.

1182
01:06:58,315 --> 01:07:00,648
To me, this is for life,

1183
01:07:00,650 --> 01:07:03,018
and that's what I'm
certainly hoping for

1184
01:07:03,020 --> 01:07:07,789
and doing everything I know to
see that that's how it goes.

1185
01:07:48,331 --> 01:07:50,465
All I can say,

1186
01:07:50,467 --> 01:07:54,636
I'm going to give it
my best shot now.

1187
01:07:54,638 --> 01:07:58,173
I don't care what people say.

1188
01:07:58,175 --> 01:08:00,842
I'm going to give it
my best fucking shot.

1189
01:08:03,513 --> 01:08:06,748
Even if it means to you
moving to Ukraine

1190
01:08:06,750 --> 01:08:09,217
and fucking leave
my fucking lovely life

1191
01:08:09,219 --> 01:08:11,786
there in Australia
behind, fuck that.

1192
01:08:11,788 --> 01:08:14,255
I can have the same life here.

1193
01:08:14,257 --> 01:08:17,225
But I feel
I want to be with them,

1194
01:08:17,227 --> 01:08:19,127
with svitlana and the kids.

1195
01:08:19,129 --> 01:08:21,796
That's it, and I'm gonna do it.

1196
01:10:28,959 --> 01:10:31,559
- Hi.
- You look so beautiful.

1197
01:10:31,561 --> 01:10:33,895
Oh, thank you. I love you.

1198
01:10:33,897 --> 01:10:35,763
I love you so much.

1199
01:10:35,765 --> 01:10:38,233
- I love you.
- I miss you.

1200
01:10:42,339 --> 01:10:45,840
So together forever,
so together.

1201
01:10:45,842 --> 01:10:50,612
Together forever. Yes.
Together forever.

1202
01:10:50,614 --> 01:10:51,846
Where you at, in Kiev?

1203
01:10:51,848 --> 01:10:56,251
Yes. Home tomorrow. Tomorrow.

1204
01:10:56,253 --> 01:10:57,485
- Tomorrow?
- Yes.

1205
01:10:57,487 --> 01:11:00,421
- Back to nikolayev?
- Yes.

1206
01:13:47,957 --> 01:13:51,959
So how do you feel?

1207
01:15:54,584 --> 01:15:57,184
What's happening today?

1208
01:15:57,186 --> 01:16:03,190
Today we're going to
the justice of the peace

1209
01:16:03,192 --> 01:16:07,662
for our legal marriage.

1210
01:17:45,128 --> 01:17:48,663
Eric and inna.
Okay, here we go.

1211
01:17:48,665 --> 01:17:51,432
Greetings
to friends and family.

1212
01:17:51,434 --> 01:17:52,833
We're gathered here today

1213
01:17:52,835 --> 01:17:54,735
to celebrate the lives
of Eric and inna,

1214
01:17:54,737 --> 01:17:56,771
who will now be joined
in marriage.

1215
01:17:56,773 --> 01:17:58,072
Now, their marriage

1216
01:17:58,074 --> 01:18:00,441
will be the intertwining
of two life stories.

1217
01:18:00,443 --> 01:18:02,443
As individuals,
they bring to the marriage

1218
01:18:02,445 --> 01:18:04,078
their own unique history

1219
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:06,213
as they choose to set aside
the single life

1220
01:18:06,215 --> 01:18:08,315
and unite as one.

1221
01:18:08,317 --> 01:18:10,918
Eric, do you take this woman

1222
01:18:10,920 --> 01:18:14,321
to be your lawfully wedded
wife, to have and to hold,

1223
01:18:14,323 --> 01:18:16,257
richer or poorer,
sickness and health

1224
01:18:16,259 --> 01:18:17,391
till death due you part?

1225
01:18:17,393 --> 01:18:18,459
I do.

1226
01:18:18,461 --> 01:18:19,927
Inna, do you take this man

1227
01:18:19,929 --> 01:18:21,262
to be your lawfully
wedded husband,

1228
01:18:21,264 --> 01:18:23,764
to have, to hold,
for richer, for poorer,

1229
01:18:23,766 --> 01:18:25,366
sickness and health,
till death due you part?

1230
01:18:25,368 --> 01:18:27,034
- I do.
- There you go.

1231
01:18:27,036 --> 01:18:30,004
So by virtue of the authority
vested in me by law

1232
01:18:30,006 --> 01:18:31,806
as justice of the peace
precinct 2,

1233
01:18:31,808 --> 01:18:33,340
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

1234
01:18:33,342 --> 01:18:34,975
You may kiss the bride.

1235
01:18:43,086 --> 01:18:47,021
Oh, that's sweet.

1236
01:19:06,209 --> 01:19:08,008
She's here already.

1237
01:19:08,010 --> 01:19:10,811
She's here. She must
have started early.

1238
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:41,142
You can stand a little bit.

1239
01:19:48,484 --> 01:19:51,051
Translator: Sorry, Michael.
Please don't get offended.

1240
01:19:51,053 --> 01:19:53,954
It's just that I don't
like the dead flowers

1241
01:19:53,956 --> 01:19:58,159
and I told you before that
I like the live flowers...

1242
01:19:58,161 --> 01:20:00,828
I didn't know that...

1243
01:20:00,830 --> 01:20:04,165
she said I shouldn't
buy her flowers,

1244
01:20:04,167 --> 01:20:07,234
but I never knew
the reason behind it.

1245
01:20:10,039 --> 01:20:14,875
Translator: She had
orchids on her wedding.

1246
01:20:14,877 --> 01:20:18,345
The wedding was decorated
with orchids.

1247
01:20:22,084 --> 01:20:23,584
Oh, well.

1248
01:20:23,586 --> 01:20:25,853
It was a very beautiful...

1249
01:20:25,855 --> 01:20:28,155
these were
very beautiful decorations

1250
01:20:28,157 --> 01:20:29,824
and everything
was very beautiful,

1251
01:20:29,826 --> 01:20:31,992
but anyway,
this was a big mistake.

1252
01:20:31,994 --> 01:20:33,360
What?

1253
01:20:38,835 --> 01:20:40,534
- The wedding was a mistake.
- Hmm?

1254
01:20:40,536 --> 01:20:41,902
The wedding was a mistake.

1255
01:20:41,904 --> 01:20:43,037
The wedding was a mistake?

1256
01:20:43,039 --> 01:20:46,440
Why did she wait
all this time then

1257
01:20:46,442 --> 01:20:49,076
to tell me only now?

1258
01:20:49,078 --> 01:20:50,611
She says that the only email

1259
01:20:50,613 --> 01:20:53,080
that she sent to you
after the wedding,

1260
01:20:53,082 --> 01:20:54,949
actually said

1261
01:20:54,951 --> 01:20:58,586
that she doesn't want
to continue any longer.

1262
01:20:58,588 --> 01:21:02,389
No, no, no, no, no, no. Mm-mm.

1263
01:21:02,391 --> 01:21:04,391
I actually remember
that email now.

1264
01:21:04,393 --> 01:21:08,996
She was saying she don't know.
She's very unsure of herself.

1265
01:21:08,998 --> 01:21:11,398
She was very unsure of herself.

1266
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:13,467
That's what she was saying.

1267
01:21:19,508 --> 01:21:22,509
But she won't be able
to be your wife,

1268
01:21:22,511 --> 01:21:27,448
and actually it's time to quit
this interview because I don't...

1269
01:21:27,450 --> 01:21:31,051
no, no, no, no,
it's not over yet.

1270
01:21:31,053 --> 01:21:34,889
Let's think about it.

1271
01:21:37,026 --> 01:21:40,461
No, no, let me...
let me... let me...

1272
01:21:40,463 --> 01:21:42,062
let me explain.

1273
01:21:42,064 --> 01:21:43,264
You're not going anywhere

1274
01:21:43,266 --> 01:21:46,066
until we sorted this thing out.

1275
01:21:46,068 --> 01:21:48,402
If you don't like a person
from the first start,

1276
01:21:48,404 --> 01:21:50,638
you should not get
involved in relations.

1277
01:21:50,640 --> 01:21:53,307
Not even get married
to that person.

1278
01:21:53,309 --> 01:21:56,443
That is totally not on

1279
01:21:56,445 --> 01:21:59,446
to get the person
to take you to Bali,

1280
01:21:59,448 --> 01:22:02,116
get married to them,
and then afterwards,

1281
01:22:02,118 --> 01:22:04,685
you just disappear,
you just get quiet.

1282
01:22:04,687 --> 01:22:07,922
You know what, I just feel

1283
01:22:07,924 --> 01:22:10,391
like I've been used by her.

1284
01:22:10,393 --> 01:22:12,459
That's all I feel now.

1285
01:22:13,596 --> 01:22:16,330
And maybe that email that I got

1286
01:22:16,332 --> 01:22:18,933
from that alexy is right,

1287
01:22:18,935 --> 01:22:21,468
that you just
use people like me

1288
01:22:21,470 --> 01:22:26,273
to just get your kicks

1289
01:22:26,275 --> 01:22:27,608
for a cheap holiday.

1290
01:22:29,478 --> 01:22:31,011
Can I have my ring back?

1291
01:22:35,651 --> 01:22:37,451
It's already here.

1292
01:22:37,453 --> 01:22:38,519
Where?

1293
01:22:40,022 --> 01:22:43,490
It's in the...
Near the flowers.

1294
01:22:43,492 --> 01:22:44,692
Can I go now?

1295
01:22:45,728 --> 01:22:47,695
Okay. Goodbye.

1296
01:22:47,697 --> 01:22:49,496
Okay. Goodbye.

1297
01:22:57,273 --> 01:23:00,107
It doesn't make sense, really.

1298
01:23:00,109 --> 01:23:02,009
So what are you going to do?

1299
01:23:02,011 --> 01:23:04,244
Well, get the fuck out of here.

1300
01:23:04,246 --> 01:23:07,114
So what else can I do, huh?

1301
01:24:07,410 --> 01:24:11,211
At the end of
"the wizard of oz,".

1302
01:24:11,213 --> 01:24:14,181
Dorothy says
something like this,

1303
01:24:14,183 --> 01:24:16,350
I've learned that
if what I'm looking for

1304
01:24:16,352 --> 01:24:18,118
is not in my own backyard,

1305
01:24:18,120 --> 01:24:20,254
then I didn't need it anyway.

1306
01:24:20,256 --> 01:24:25,092
So I've learned
some appreciation

1307
01:24:25,094 --> 01:24:27,127
for the women back at home.

1308
01:24:27,129 --> 01:24:29,129
I'm dating a woman now,

1309
01:24:29,131 --> 01:24:31,465
and we actually dated before
I went to the Ukraine.

1310
01:24:31,467 --> 01:24:33,333
And then we broke up

1311
01:24:33,335 --> 01:24:37,104
and I think I had
some areas in my life

1312
01:24:37,106 --> 01:24:38,806
that I needed to give on.

1313
01:24:38,808 --> 01:24:41,341
I think she has some that
she needed to give on.

1314
01:24:41,343 --> 01:24:43,444
A special person like that

1315
01:24:43,446 --> 01:24:45,412
doesn't come around
but so often.

1316
01:25:00,863 --> 01:25:03,764
After all this, I got
depressed for a while.

1317
01:25:03,766 --> 01:25:08,202
It really, definitely
affected me.

1318
01:25:08,204 --> 01:25:09,369
I sat around.

1319
01:25:09,371 --> 01:25:13,440
I actually went and got
some bupropion

1320
01:25:13,442 --> 01:25:15,676
to help with that.

1321
01:25:15,678 --> 01:25:17,177
Finally worked through it.

1322
01:25:17,179 --> 01:25:19,413
Pretty much stopped
trying to date,

1323
01:25:19,415 --> 01:25:22,282
anything like that
until just recently.

1324
01:25:22,284 --> 01:25:24,651
I figured I might try it
one more time.

1325
01:25:24,653 --> 01:25:26,520
This is her, huh?

1326
01:25:26,522 --> 01:25:28,755
Yeah. This is becka.

1327
01:25:30,126 --> 01:25:32,693
It's not the same as Julia.

1328
01:25:32,695 --> 01:25:34,728
I'm getting personal responses

1329
01:25:34,730 --> 01:25:37,698
and actual, you know,

1330
01:25:37,700 --> 01:25:39,333
it looks like someone's
actually putting some thought

1331
01:25:39,335 --> 01:25:40,834
into the email.

1332
01:25:40,836 --> 01:25:45,339
Do you ever just feel like
you're just writing a photo?

1333
01:25:47,843 --> 01:25:50,777
Yeah.

1334
01:25:52,548 --> 01:25:55,549
Would you say you're
in love with vica?

1335
01:25:55,551 --> 01:25:57,351
Right now I don't know.

1336
01:25:57,353 --> 01:25:59,386
I thought I was,

1337
01:25:59,388 --> 01:26:04,725
and then...

1338
01:26:04,727 --> 01:26:07,561
It's this money thing.

1339
01:26:07,563 --> 01:26:09,530
It's completely the money.

1340
01:26:09,532 --> 01:26:12,833
If it wasn't for the money,
there'd be no doubt.

1341
01:26:12,835 --> 01:26:20,340
It seems like it's gotten
worse after this last trip

1342
01:26:20,342 --> 01:26:22,409
as far as asking for money.

1343
01:26:22,411 --> 01:26:24,912
I don't... I told her,

1344
01:26:24,914 --> 01:26:27,514
no more after this last trip.

1345
01:26:27,516 --> 01:26:31,585
I'm to the point
I'm just fed up with it

1346
01:26:31,587 --> 01:26:33,754
because if we weren't going
through the visa process,

1347
01:26:33,756 --> 01:26:36,390
there's no way I'd
keep going on with it.

1348
01:26:43,499 --> 01:26:46,266
There was no fear
of getting married

1349
01:26:46,268 --> 01:26:50,737
and marrying vita like,
you know, the jitters,

1350
01:26:50,739 --> 01:26:52,573
the pre-wedding jitters.

1351
01:26:52,575 --> 01:26:55,509
There was none of that.

1352
01:26:55,511 --> 01:26:56,810
This is what I wanted

1353
01:26:56,812 --> 01:26:59,880
was someone to spend
the rest of my life with.

1354
01:26:59,882 --> 01:27:01,348
Robert...

1355
01:27:01,350 --> 01:27:02,649
Robert...

1356
01:27:02,651 --> 01:27:04,218
Today I give...

1357
01:27:04,220 --> 01:27:05,285
Today I give...

1358
01:27:05,287 --> 01:27:06,954
- My love...
- My love...

1359
01:27:06,956 --> 01:27:08,989
- To you.
- To you.

1360
01:27:23,305 --> 01:27:25,706
Most people think it's
the guy going over there

1361
01:27:25,708 --> 01:27:27,808
and they pick the woman.

1362
01:27:27,810 --> 01:27:29,910
They're not waiting
to be picked.

1363
01:27:29,912 --> 01:27:32,512
They want the same relationship

1364
01:27:32,514 --> 01:27:36,016
that every other woman wants.

1365
01:27:36,018 --> 01:27:38,652
They don't want just anybody.

1366
01:27:38,654 --> 01:27:41,455
They want someone
that's right for them.

1367
01:27:41,457 --> 01:27:44,558
I'm a reasonable person

1368
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:47,027
and he is, too.

1369
01:27:47,029 --> 01:27:51,698
And I always know that
I need to have man

1370
01:27:51,700 --> 01:27:54,868
who I will respect.

1371
01:27:54,870 --> 01:27:58,338
It's a very good feeling

1372
01:27:58,340 --> 01:28:01,942
when you think...
when you wake up

1373
01:28:01,944 --> 01:28:04,711
and think how I love here.

1374
01:28:04,713 --> 01:28:07,914
It's very good.

1375
01:28:07,916 --> 01:28:09,883
I've seen things in Eric

1376
01:28:09,885 --> 01:28:13,920
that I've never seen before
when he's with inna.

1377
01:28:13,922 --> 01:28:16,690
He's always been
thoughtful and kind,

1378
01:28:16,692 --> 01:28:21,762
but more attentive, more aware.

1379
01:28:21,764 --> 01:28:23,997
This year I got
a mother's day email

1380
01:28:23,999 --> 01:28:25,999
with pictures from them.

1381
01:28:26,001 --> 01:28:29,336
He'd never sent
a mother's day card.

1382
01:28:29,338 --> 01:28:30,804
Things are awakening in him

1383
01:28:30,806 --> 01:28:34,741
that he's never
had to think of.

1384
01:28:34,743 --> 01:28:36,576
Your mother and father told us

1385
01:28:36,578 --> 01:28:39,346
about a big development.

1386
01:28:39,348 --> 01:28:41,982
Oh, yeah?

1387
01:28:41,984 --> 01:28:43,784
Yeah, that is true.

1388
01:28:43,786 --> 01:28:45,652
What is it?

1389
01:28:45,654 --> 01:28:48,622
Pregnant. I'm pregnant.

1390
01:28:48,624 --> 01:28:51,091
About four months.

1391
01:28:51,093 --> 01:28:54,995
I have family,
what I always imagined.

1392
01:28:54,997 --> 01:28:59,099
I'm so happy for him
to have somebody,

1393
01:28:59,101 --> 01:29:01,501
somebody to be with,

1394
01:29:01,503 --> 01:29:04,638
somebody to do things with,

1395
01:29:04,640 --> 01:29:06,773
somebody to love.

1396
01:29:06,775 --> 01:29:11,111
You need somebody to love
and to love you.

1397
01:29:11,113 --> 01:29:13,613
John: Guys, it'll never
ever happen

1398
01:29:13,615 --> 01:29:15,115
just sitting on your couch,

1399
01:29:15,117 --> 01:29:17,584
whether you go with us
or you go with someone else

1400
01:29:17,586 --> 01:29:19,686
or you, I don't care,
get on a plane

1401
01:29:19,688 --> 01:29:21,021
and just go
over there yourself.

1402
01:29:21,023 --> 01:29:24,024
Put yourself in an opportunity
to meet someone.

1403
01:29:24,026 --> 01:29:26,493
Rob, will, everybody,
thank you very much.

1404
01:29:26,495 --> 01:29:27,694
Yes. Thanks for having us.

1405
01:29:27,696 --> 01:29:29,029
And we will see you
in just two weeks

1406
01:29:29,031 --> 01:29:31,998
with another great show.
So until then, bye-bye.

1407
01:29:35,371 --> 01:29:38,505
What is love?

1408
01:29:40,642 --> 01:29:42,075
Love.

1409
01:29:48,951 --> 01:29:51,385
I will start to cry.

1410
01:29:57,826 --> 01:30:01,962
Love is when you can say

1411
01:30:01,964 --> 01:30:05,098
that I will just give
my life for somebody.

1412
01:30:05,100 --> 01:30:07,601
I think that's love.

1413
01:30:10,105 --> 01:30:12,606
How does one find love?

1414
01:30:16,779 --> 01:30:18,645
I don't know.

1415
01:30:18,647 --> 01:30:22,816
I think you have to be
lucky to find it.

1416
01:30:22,818 --> 01:30:25,419
You have to keep looking

1417
01:30:25,421 --> 01:30:28,555
and if you are lucky,
you will find it.

1418
01:30:28,557 --> 01:30:31,758
If not, some people
will never find it.

1419
01:30:31,760 --> 01:30:36,730
So you just need
to keep looking.
