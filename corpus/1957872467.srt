00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:04,653
[waves crashing]

2
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,498
[in Italian] I'm sorry, my son.

3
00:00:33,276 --> 00:00:35,986
[in English] My Italian is a bit rusty.

4
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:37,323
Continue.

5
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:10,569
Why would you do this, my son?

6
00:01:21,535 --> 00:01:23,079
[gunshots]

7
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:44,022
[ominous music]

8
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:48,109
Within your own heart,
you must repent my son,

9
00:01:49,158 --> 00:01:52,257
for only then will you be forgiven.

10
00:01:58,844 --> 00:02:01,020
It is not for me, my son.

11
00:02:02,474 --> 00:02:07,614
For only the almighty Lord in
heaven offers what you seek.

12
00:02:07,638 --> 00:02:09,784
[ominous music]

13
00:02:12,776 --> 00:02:13,854
[gunshot]

14
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:17,195
[gunshots]

15
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:59,229
[thrilling music]

16
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:31,199
[thrilling music]

17
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:26,869
[thrilling music]

18
00:05:43,542 --> 00:05:45,556
Great writers write what they know.

19
00:05:46,246 --> 00:05:48,331
What does a mediocre writer do?

20
00:05:48,863 --> 00:05:52,543
Sure write what you know is good for
guys like Hemingway or Kerouac,

21
00:05:53,151 --> 00:05:54,418
but what about me?

22
00:05:57,149 --> 00:06:00,832
Hi, I'm Zane.
I'm an alcoholic.

23
00:06:01,525 --> 00:06:03,452
[in unison] Hi, Zane.

24
00:06:03,964 --> 00:06:06,920
I'm a writer.
Or, at least I'm trying to be.

25
00:06:07,383 --> 00:06:09,592
I read that if you're
serious about writing,

26
00:06:09,616 --> 00:06:12,229
you should carry a tape recorder around.

27
00:06:12,486 --> 00:06:16,186
Unfortunately, the only things I've
been interesting in recording is

28
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:17,979
evidence of my writer's block.

29
00:06:20,231 --> 00:06:24,260
Sex, violence, acts of heroism,

30
00:06:24,656 --> 00:06:26,423
that's what makes a good story.

31
00:06:27,104 --> 00:06:28,758
I don't have anything like that.

32
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:31,756
I do have one thing
good stories have, though.

33
00:06:33,176 --> 00:06:34,602
Conflict.

34
00:06:35,485 --> 00:06:36,816
See, I have a problem.

35
00:06:38,405 --> 00:06:40,710
Actually, it's a big problem.

36
00:06:41,543 --> 00:06:42,747
It's a gambling problem.

37
00:06:45,284 --> 00:06:46,935
There are the games.

38
00:06:48,744 --> 00:06:52,557
Well, not so much games as watching two
men beat the piss out of each other.

39
00:06:53,136 --> 00:06:54,308
[bell rings]

40
00:06:54,782 --> 00:06:57,062
[crowd cheers]

41
00:06:58,254 --> 00:06:59,254
[punch]

42
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:05,941
[crowd cheers and yells]

43
00:07:07,513 --> 00:07:08,588
[loud hit]

44
00:07:08,815 --> 00:07:10,350
[crowd] Ooh!

45
00:07:13,013 --> 00:07:14,330
[man] Damn!

46
00:07:16,154 --> 00:07:19,058
That guy... was my sure thing!

47
00:07:19,253 --> 00:07:23,262
Unfortunately, the definition of
gamble means there is no sure thing.

48
00:07:25,247 --> 00:07:28,380
Being a great writer doesn't
mean knowing what to write about

49
00:07:28,544 --> 00:07:30,452
so much as where to start.

50
00:07:31,936 --> 00:07:34,283
Hey horse, why the long face?

51
00:07:35,215 --> 00:07:36,215
What?

52
00:07:36,368 --> 00:07:38,869
I said hey h... ah it's not important.

53
00:07:40,122 --> 00:07:41,995
So what's with the confessional?

54
00:07:44,429 --> 00:07:47,153
Oh, uh... writing a book.

55
00:07:48,213 --> 00:07:49,825
You're writing a book?

56
00:07:50,256 --> 00:07:53,929
Nowadays people use computers for
that sort of thing, don't they?

57
00:07:54,347 --> 00:07:55,590
I can't type.

58
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:56,864
You cant type?

59
00:07:56,888 --> 00:07:59,973
I've got a niece who wanted to be
a ballerina, she's got no legs.

60
00:07:59,997 --> 00:08:01,882
[chuckles] Pretty bad odds, you know?

61
00:08:01,906 --> 00:08:03,228
My name's Phil.

62
00:08:03,944 --> 00:08:06,482
You're sitting here like
someone just ran over your dog,

63
00:08:06,506 --> 00:08:08,648
you look like you needed a friend.

64
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:12,580
Zane.

65
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,163
So what's this book about, Zane?

66
00:08:15,709 --> 00:08:17,751
- It's a long story.
- Good!

67
00:08:17,779 --> 00:08:20,788
I like long stories, as long as
there's sex and violence in it.

68
00:08:20,812 --> 00:08:22,489
So uh, what's her name?

69
00:08:22,517 --> 00:08:24,574
[sighs] There is no her.

70
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:26,921
No sex?

71
00:08:27,658 --> 00:08:29,233
No violence?

72
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:31,625
Well then what the hell is it about?

73
00:08:32,093 --> 00:08:33,540
To tell you the truth, I...

74
00:08:33,564 --> 00:08:35,362
I haven't actually gotten that far yet.

75
00:08:35,512 --> 00:08:37,771
What are you putting
into this tape recorder?

76
00:08:37,795 --> 00:08:40,093
Eh, you know. This, that.

77
00:08:40,711 --> 00:08:42,034
Notes on my life.

78
00:08:42,058 --> 00:08:45,263
You never know what little thing
could be the inspiration you need.

79
00:08:46,021 --> 00:08:48,126
There you go,
why don't you write about that?

80
00:08:48,344 --> 00:08:49,743
What, my life?

81
00:08:49,767 --> 00:08:52,929
Sure, everybody's got
a story or two to tell.

82
00:08:52,953 --> 00:08:55,872
[chuckles] Nobody wants
to hear about my life.

83
00:08:56,538 --> 00:08:58,402
It'd be too depressing.

84
00:08:58,426 --> 00:09:01,276
Come on, it can't be that bad!

85
00:09:02,048 --> 00:09:05,408
[rock music in distance]

86
00:09:05,432 --> 00:09:09,424
I'm... kinda in the hole
for a hundred thousand.

87
00:09:10,823 --> 00:09:12,098
I was wrong.

88
00:09:12,537 --> 00:09:15,342
I'm sorry. I was in the
hole for a hundred thousand.

89
00:09:15,586 --> 00:09:17,736
I borrowed some money from
a loan shark to place a bet

90
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,786
and ended up owing
another hundred and fifty.

91
00:09:23,518 --> 00:09:25,158
Two fifty large?

92
00:09:25,717 --> 00:09:28,307
You like to stick it in
and break it off, don't you?

93
00:09:28,998 --> 00:09:30,269
You got a plan?

94
00:09:30,293 --> 00:09:33,776
Eh, I could always...
drink myself to death.

95
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:36,838
This loan shark, what's his name?

96
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:39,116
His name is Giovanni.

97
00:09:39,337 --> 00:09:40,525
Good god, son.

98
00:09:40,552 --> 00:09:43,000
Giovanni likes to break
bones alphabetically,

99
00:09:43,024 --> 00:09:45,295
starting with your A-hole.

100
00:09:46,804 --> 00:09:48,242
Thanks for the encouragement.

101
00:09:48,917 --> 00:09:52,002
You know, I knew a guy once who
had the same problem you have.

102
00:09:52,451 --> 00:09:53,698
Yeah, what'd he do?

103
00:09:54,087 --> 00:09:56,642
I'm not really sure,
I think he's dead now.

104
00:09:57,233 --> 00:09:58,882
[man] Hey Phil, where you at, man?

105
00:09:58,906 --> 00:10:01,034
Cool your jets, son.
I'll be right there.

106
00:10:02,301 --> 00:10:04,470
It's time for you to make a choice.

107
00:10:05,629 --> 00:10:06,668
About what?

108
00:10:07,008 --> 00:10:09,040
Burial or cremation.

109
00:10:10,456 --> 00:10:12,319
Listen Phil, the drink, I can't...

110
00:10:12,343 --> 00:10:15,142
Nah. Drink's on the house, kid.

111
00:10:20,111 --> 00:10:22,125
It's funny how you deal with stress.

112
00:10:22,671 --> 00:10:24,523
A couple of drinks here and
there can take the edge off,

113
00:10:24,546 --> 00:10:27,222
but that's not why I come here.

114
00:10:27,714 --> 00:10:29,380
I come here to hide.

115
00:10:30,256 --> 00:10:33,089
I feel safer in this back-alley
bar than I do in my own home.

116
00:10:35,074 --> 00:10:36,163
Home.

117
00:10:37,293 --> 00:10:39,247
People can still find you.

118
00:10:41,155 --> 00:10:43,683
[phone rings]

119
00:10:45,663 --> 00:10:47,648
[phone rings]

120
00:10:50,064 --> 00:10:52,289
[phone rings]

121
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:55,613
[answering machine]Hi, this is Zane.

122
00:10:55,637 --> 00:10:57,203
Probably off somewhere losing money,

123
00:10:57,227 --> 00:11:00,582
so leave a message and
I'll catch you when I get back.

124
00:11:01,409 --> 00:11:02,409
[phone bleeps]

125
00:11:03,867 --> 00:11:06,175
[woman] I know you're there,
pick up the phone.

126
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:09,837
God, Zane, this is so childish.

127
00:11:12,704 --> 00:11:15,138
I wasn't surprised when you
stopped sending the alimony

128
00:11:15,162 --> 00:11:18,289
just like I wasn't surprised
when you lost your job.

129
00:11:19,057 --> 00:11:22,582
I'm used to certain things from you
but this is getting out of hand.

130
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:26,018
You're still writing that
book, aren't you?

131
00:11:26,551 --> 00:11:28,356
God, it's so sad.

132
00:11:28,514 --> 00:11:31,367
You've become such a
pathetic waste of a man.

133
00:11:31,741 --> 00:11:35,086
The only way you'd be good to
anyone is if you were dead.

134
00:11:35,717 --> 00:11:39,797
Maybe I should do the world
a favor and kill you myself.

135
00:11:41,249 --> 00:11:42,255
[phone bleeps]

136
00:11:49,922 --> 00:11:52,813
[toothbrush buzzes]

137
00:12:11,137 --> 00:12:13,645
Hm. At least I'll die with clean teeth.

138
00:12:27,581 --> 00:12:29,945
- [man] You should really lock your door.
- [Zane screams]

139
00:12:30,033 --> 00:12:32,036
Anyone could just walk in.

140
00:12:33,653 --> 00:12:34,794
Comfortable?

141
00:12:35,191 --> 00:12:36,878
[pants] Who are you?

142
00:12:37,462 --> 00:12:39,062
I asked if you were comfortable.

143
00:12:39,704 --> 00:12:41,985
- Should I be?
- Yes.

144
00:12:42,902 --> 00:12:46,449
[ominous music]

145
00:12:46,473 --> 00:12:47,694
You should.

146
00:12:49,985 --> 00:12:51,301
[chuckles]

147
00:12:51,371 --> 00:12:53,054
Just a gentle reminder.

148
00:12:53,453 --> 00:12:56,004
You and I have a few matters to discuss.

149
00:12:58,523 --> 00:13:00,191
You know, you're not a bad writer.

150
00:13:01,121 --> 00:13:02,368
Thank you.

151
00:13:03,067 --> 00:13:04,824
This would make for a pretty good story.

152
00:13:05,565 --> 00:13:07,363
A lot of dramatic tension.

153
00:13:08,136 --> 00:13:10,043
Great stories are hard to come by.

154
00:13:10,466 --> 00:13:12,013
You tell so much.

155
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:15,121
You know, art imitating life.

156
00:13:17,098 --> 00:13:19,369
Are you familiar with
The Merchant of Venice?

157
00:13:19,928 --> 00:13:23,249
Isn't that that place by the airport
that sells Italian shoes?

158
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:25,845
[chuckles] Not quite.

159
00:13:25,869 --> 00:13:29,024
It's a play by William Shakespeare.

160
00:13:29,257 --> 00:13:32,567
Let's consider it a bedtime story
from your Uncle Uno.

161
00:13:33,859 --> 00:13:35,533
It's a story about Antonio,

162
00:13:36,369 --> 00:13:40,570
an honorable man,
full of charity, good will.

163
00:13:41,893 --> 00:13:46,221
To help a friend in need,
he borrows money from Shylock.

164
00:13:46,933 --> 00:13:51,487
Now Shylock,
he's not quite as generous as Antonio.

165
00:13:51,758 --> 00:13:54,677
So, when the debt can't be repaid,

166
00:13:55,851 --> 00:13:59,694
Shylock decides to take a pound
of Antonio's flesh instead.

167
00:13:59,949 --> 00:14:03,510
[chuckles] Life does imitate art.

168
00:14:03,534 --> 00:14:05,215
You're Antonio.

169
00:14:06,526 --> 00:14:09,069
Mr. G, he's Shylock.

170
00:14:09,093 --> 00:14:14,038
And if we don't see half
of that money in 36 hours,

171
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,373
I'll be coming for that pound of flesh.

172
00:14:17,725 --> 00:14:19,376
Do we understand each other?

173
00:14:20,211 --> 00:14:21,211
Crystal.

174
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:23,860
[laughs] I know we would.

175
00:14:33,283 --> 00:14:36,575
So, what happens to Antonio in the end?

176
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:38,380
Oh, he's saved by a woman.

177
00:14:38,722 --> 00:14:41,574
But... I would hold my
breath if I were you.

178
00:14:41,963 --> 00:14:43,666
It is just a play.

179
00:14:44,404 --> 00:14:46,483
Sweet dreams, Zane.

[upbeat music]

182
00:15:20,206 --> 00:15:25,810
[music continues]

183
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,150
[Zane] This is Benny, the loan officer.

184
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:41,452
I know I don't keep the best company,

185
00:15:41,476 --> 00:15:44,967
but this fat, pastrami-smelling pig
is sleazy, even by my standards.

186
00:15:44,991 --> 00:15:46,441
Not a chance in hell.

187
00:15:46,465 --> 00:15:47,583
Why not?

188
00:15:48,358 --> 00:15:50,422
Because you don't have any collateral.

189
00:15:50,446 --> 00:15:51,908
What about the house?

190
00:15:52,336 --> 00:15:54,067
It isn't yours.

191
00:15:54,295 --> 00:15:55,454
Yeah, it is!

192
00:15:56,676 --> 00:15:59,608
Unless you can produce a
Holly Stevens to sign it,

193
00:15:59,632 --> 00:16:01,317
I can't give you any money.

194
00:16:03,571 --> 00:16:05,398
And besides,

195
00:16:05,853 --> 00:16:07,942
she already has a lean on it.

196
00:16:11,459 --> 00:16:14,058
You haven't been making
your alimony payments, huh?

197
00:16:14,085 --> 00:16:16,408
Boy, they get you for that
every time, slappy.

198
00:16:17,442 --> 00:16:18,763
What about the car?

199
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:27,957
This piece of shit for the kind
of money you're asking for?

200
00:16:28,456 --> 00:16:29,491
Listen,

201
00:16:29,748 --> 00:16:31,238
you're the fifth guy I've seen today,

202
00:16:31,262 --> 00:16:33,067
no one else will even talk to me.

203
00:16:33,227 --> 00:16:34,900
I'm running out of time, Benny.

204
00:16:34,924 --> 00:16:38,329
You could always take a shot in the
mouth down at Eleventh and Bleeker.

205
00:16:39,115 --> 00:16:41,235
Seems to work for the crack heads!

206
00:16:41,499 --> 00:16:42,885
That's not funny.

207
00:16:43,429 --> 00:16:44,738
All right, look kid.

208
00:16:45,399 --> 00:16:47,319
I don't do this for just anybody.

209
00:16:47,652 --> 00:16:50,400
If you're really desperate,
I'll give you a number.

210
00:16:50,462 --> 00:16:53,117
You call this guy, he'll help you.

211
00:17:03,864 --> 00:17:06,353

00:17:10,712 --> 00:17:12,776

[loud hit]
[gasps]

215
00:17:56,449 --> 00:17:58,685
Yeah, whatever.

216
00:17:59,344 --> 00:18:00,627
Jerk.

217
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:12,947

[loud explosion]

221
00:18:22,572 --> 00:18:24,418
[Zane] Writers are
supposed to be articulate

222
00:18:24,442 --> 00:18:27,853
and describe everything with beautifully
written synonyms and metaphors.

223
00:18:28,086 --> 00:18:29,741
Well that's fine, but

224
00:18:29,765 --> 00:18:31,329
sometimes you only need two words.

225
00:18:31,353 --> 00:18:33,084
Holy shit!

226
00:18:34,254 --> 00:18:36,569
[Zane] Yep, two words.

227
00:18:39,205 --> 00:18:40,839

[thrilling music]

231
00:19:11,152 --> 00:19:12,739
That's my car, you asshole!

232
00:19:14,249 --> 00:19:16,443

[sighs]

236
00:19:34,677 --> 00:19:36,294
[Zane] It's funny how at the same time,

237
00:19:36,318 --> 00:19:39,183
you can be thinking about
everything and nothing at all.

238
00:19:41,982 --> 00:19:44,360
I had no idea what was going on,
but at least now,

239
00:19:44,384 --> 00:19:46,288
I had a moment to relax.

240
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,930
Then suddenly, that moment ended.

241
00:19:50,954 --> 00:19:52,550
[crash]

242
00:19:57,073 --> 00:19:58,275
God!

243
00:19:59,101 --> 00:20:01,235
Sir, are you all right?

244
00:20:01,453 --> 00:20:02,730
Are you okay?

245
00:20:03,018 --> 00:20:04,018
I'm okay.

246
00:20:04,042 --> 00:20:06,491
Look, I... I didn't see the light.
I'm sorry.

247
00:20:06,515 --> 00:20:08,953
It's okay, really.
Are you all right?

248
00:20:08,977 --> 00:20:10,271
Yeah. No, I'm fine.

249
00:20:10,295 --> 00:20:11,749
Here's the thing, I...

250
00:20:11,776 --> 00:20:15,454
I have money to pay for your car,
but I don't have any insurance.

251
00:20:15,594 --> 00:20:17,662
I need to get out of here.
Can you give me a ride?

252
00:20:17,686 --> 00:20:18,704
What?

253
00:20:18,728 --> 00:20:21,248
Look, if you give me a ride,
we can forget about this whole thing.

254
00:20:21,271 --> 00:20:22,446
O-okay.

255
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:24,057
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

256
00:20:28,531 --> 00:20:31,258
So, what kinda fellow you looking for?

257
00:20:31,457 --> 00:20:34,597
Well, let's see.
Someone tall, handsome.

258
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:36,967
Who knows how to pour a drink.

259
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:39,800
Hm, one out of three ain't bad.

260
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:43,096
You know,
I think you're trying to use me...

261
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,701
and I like it.

262
00:20:50,902 --> 00:20:53,143
Phil. We need to talk.

263
00:20:55,605 --> 00:20:58,233
Two seconds, speedy,
I'm already talking here.

264
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:00,910
This is serious,
I need to talk to you right now.

265
00:21:00,936 --> 00:21:04,613
You're serious, we're not serious.
We're having fun here.

266
00:21:06,194 --> 00:21:08,764
Honey, go powder your nose,
come back in a few minutes.

267
00:21:08,788 --> 00:21:10,937
We have some business to discuss.

268
00:21:15,657 --> 00:21:17,775
What the hell's the matter with you?

269
00:21:18,879 --> 00:21:22,809
What the hell could be more important
than to score with something like that?

270
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:24,328
I didn't know who to go to with this,

271
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:26,495
I thought you might know what I should do.

272
00:21:26,751 --> 00:21:28,715
Well you just met me, kid.

273
00:21:30,088 --> 00:21:31,844
Somebody just tried to kill me.

274
00:21:31,868 --> 00:21:32,946
Who was it?

275
00:21:33,332 --> 00:21:34,837
I don't know, he was shooting at me!

276
00:21:34,861 --> 00:21:36,899
I really didn't have
time to ask him his name.

277
00:21:36,923 --> 00:21:38,890
Sit down.
Calm down.

278
00:21:40,513 --> 00:21:44,290
Now, did you call the police?

279
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:50,750
No, I didn't call the police!
I mean...

280
00:21:50,774 --> 00:21:54,630
Stealing a car, a hit and run,
destruction of private property.

281
00:21:54,654 --> 00:21:56,088
They'd put me in jail!

282
00:21:56,112 --> 00:21:57,763
Then why the hell did you come here?

283
00:21:57,964 --> 00:22:00,362
I don't know,
I don't know what else to do.

284
00:22:01,546 --> 00:22:03,207
Look son, I'm flattered,

285
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:06,124
but I can't see how I can help you.

286
00:22:06,476 --> 00:22:09,166
Well why would they tell me
one thing and do another?

287
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:11,126
Why would who tell you what?

288
00:22:11,806 --> 00:22:14,034
Last night, there was a man in my house.

289
00:22:14,058 --> 00:22:15,840
He said they would give me 36 hours

290
00:22:15,864 --> 00:22:18,168
before they came and
took a pound of my flesh

291
00:22:18,192 --> 00:22:20,308
or some crazy shit like that,

292
00:22:20,332 --> 00:22:23,648
and then tonight,
somebody blew up my car and shot at me.

293
00:22:23,803 --> 00:22:25,998
I really don't know how I'm still alive!

294
00:22:26,403 --> 00:22:29,462
The shit has hit the fan and
you've got brown freckles.

295
00:22:29,486 --> 00:22:31,566
You think I can reason with him and...

296
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:33,999
I don't know,
set up a payment plan or something?

297
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:37,202
A payment plan?
This guy's not running a dentist's office.

298
00:22:37,226 --> 00:22:40,645
What should I do?
I need a little advice here, Phil.

299
00:22:40,669 --> 00:22:43,577
And my advice to you is to
get out of town tonight.

300
00:22:43,935 --> 00:22:46,685
Maybe you'll slip through
Giovanni's fingers.

301
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:49,875
Just start running and don't stop.

302
00:22:50,264 --> 00:22:51,529
Keep running.

303
00:22:53,957 --> 00:22:55,030
That's it?

304
00:22:55,847 --> 00:22:57,411
Yeah, that's it.

305
00:22:59,299 --> 00:23:00,324
Thanks.

306
00:23:05,733 --> 00:23:06,822
What will you have?

307
00:23:08,518 --> 00:23:11,930
[traffic noise]

308
00:23:17,586 --> 00:23:18,900
Was your friend any help?

309
00:23:19,138 --> 00:23:21,203
Not the kind I was looking for.

310
00:23:21,806 --> 00:23:24,539
Listen, I want to thank you
for everything you've done.

311
00:23:24,563 --> 00:23:25,913
Don't mention it.

312
00:23:26,537 --> 00:23:27,671
So...

313
00:23:28,119 --> 00:23:29,434
what are you gonna do now?

314
00:23:29,845 --> 00:23:30,953
I don't know.

315
00:23:31,184 --> 00:23:32,576
Get a cab, I guess.

316
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,961
I could give you a ride.

317
00:23:34,114 --> 00:23:36,540
- Sure you don't mind?
- I wouldn't offer if I did.

318
00:23:36,564 --> 00:23:39,156
You saved me a lot of trouble back
there by not calling the cops,

319
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:41,800
the least I can do is give you
a ride wherever you're going.

320
00:23:46,081 --> 00:23:52,766
[jazz music]

321
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:14,641
Nice place.

322
00:24:17,013 --> 00:24:19,329
Yeah, it is.

323
00:24:20,319 --> 00:24:21,769
It's not mine.

00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:47,459
Oh, by the way, my name's Zane.

327
00:24:47,895 --> 00:24:49,257
I'm Lara.

328
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:05,226
[sighs] I need a day off.

329
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:06,252
I gotta go get something.

330
00:25:06,276 --> 00:25:07,930
Uh, what about that drink?

331
00:25:08,186 --> 00:25:11,219
Uh, everything's in the kitchen.
Ice is in the fridge.

332
00:25:11,243 --> 00:25:12,533
Make yourself at home.

333
00:25:57,617 --> 00:25:59,540
[Zane] After everything
I've been through today,

334
00:25:59,564 --> 00:26:01,232
all I needed was a band-aid.

335
00:26:01,749 --> 00:26:03,253
I guess I got lucky.

336
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:07,355
My problem is, luck usually runs out.

337
00:26:22,146 --> 00:26:23,630

345
00:27:15,115 --> 00:27:16,634
You okay?

346
00:27:19,152 --> 00:27:21,774
I'm doing better than he is.
Is he dead?

347
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:26,985
I don't know!
I've never done this before!

348
00:27:27,472 --> 00:27:28,738
Oh shit!

349
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:31,241
[fire crackling]

350
00:27:31,265 --> 00:27:32,273
[coughing] Let's go.

351
00:27:32,297 --> 00:27:33,297
What?

352
00:27:33,502 --> 00:27:35,603
I'm not going anywhere,
my house is on fire!

353
00:27:35,627 --> 00:27:36,986
It's too late!
We gotta move!

354
00:27:46,855 --> 00:27:48,509
[laughs]

355
00:27:48,533 --> 00:27:51,068
What now, huh?
What comes next?

356
00:27:52,381 --> 00:27:54,997
Oh my God, I forgot my bag in your house.

357
00:27:55,021 --> 00:27:57,145
- We'll get you a new one.
- No, you don't understand.

358
00:27:57,169 --> 00:27:58,798
Everything I own is in that bag,

359
00:27:58,822 --> 00:28:02,162
my money, my credit cards,
my phone book, everything.

360
00:28:02,564 --> 00:28:06,261
My house is on fire.

361
00:28:06,402 --> 00:28:08,334
I... I don't even have
anywhere to go tonight.

362
00:28:08,361 --> 00:28:11,922
I have no place to stay,
I cant even put gas in my own car now.

363
00:28:13,325 --> 00:28:16,699
You see this? Now, I will pay you
for whatever you lost plus interest.

364
00:28:16,723 --> 00:28:18,347
Just take me where I need to go,

365
00:28:18,371 --> 00:28:19,638
I'll get you a place to stay,

366
00:28:19,662 --> 00:28:22,566
and in the morning,
you never have to see me again.

367
00:28:23,028 --> 00:28:24,733
What about your house?

368
00:28:26,782 --> 00:28:28,589
It's my ex-wife's house now.

369
00:28:40,938 --> 00:28:43,925
So I'm beginning to think that
writing about what you know

370
00:28:43,949 --> 00:28:47,864
probably isn't the best way to
go about this whole book thing.

371
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:51,209
Quite frankly, I'm starting
to think it'd be a lot easier

372
00:28:51,233 --> 00:28:54,294
to write about something silly like...

373
00:28:54,318 --> 00:28:55,876
like cheese.

374
00:28:56,160 --> 00:29:00,518
After all, there are so many
different kinds of cheese.

375
00:29:00,981 --> 00:29:02,415
You're a writer?

376
00:29:02,992 --> 00:29:04,201
Uh, sort of.

377
00:29:04,335 --> 00:29:05,752
What kinda of book are you writing?

378
00:29:06,201 --> 00:29:08,011
I'll let you know when I figure it out.

379
00:29:12,332 --> 00:29:16,806
So, before I insert myself into your
life, where are you headed?

380
00:29:16,984 --> 00:29:19,671
Okay, so now you want to go
beyond the idle chit-chat stage

381
00:29:19,694 --> 00:29:20,826
and get to know each other, huh?

382
00:29:20,849 --> 00:29:22,934
[sighs] I'm sorry, I shouldn't pry.

383
00:29:22,957 --> 00:29:25,230
That's okay. I was headed to New York.

384
00:29:25,254 --> 00:29:26,878
I've got family there and I just needed

385
00:29:26,902 --> 00:29:28,675
to get away from home for a few days.

386
00:29:28,699 --> 00:29:31,312
- Yeah, where's home?
- Wisconsin.

387
00:29:31,917 --> 00:29:34,605
Well, they do have cheese in Wisconsin.

388
00:29:35,677 --> 00:29:38,708
So, do you mind telling me
exactly where we're headed?

389
00:29:39,495 --> 00:29:41,322
About two more miles up the road.

390
00:29:41,345 --> 00:29:42,627
What's there?

391
00:29:42,892 --> 00:29:45,945
The only guy in the world I
know I can trust right now.

392
00:29:46,133 --> 00:29:47,598
How do you know him?

393
00:29:47,777 --> 00:29:49,328
Alcoholics Anonymous.

394
00:29:49,506 --> 00:29:51,677
[chuckles] He sounds really nice.

395
00:29:51,776 --> 00:29:53,089
He's not.

396
00:30:02,653 --> 00:30:04,171
Turn it over here.

397
00:30:13,431 --> 00:30:14,736
[car door opens]

398
00:30:18,906 --> 00:30:19,906
[car door closes]

399
00:30:21,167 --> 00:30:23,049
Your friend works at a motel?

400
00:30:23,234 --> 00:30:24,741
He lives here.

401
00:30:53,564 --> 00:30:56,220
Be on your toes. This
guy can be a little strange.

402
00:30:56,243 --> 00:30:57,845
[knocking]

403
00:30:58,109 --> 00:30:59,224
[Bill] Knock knock.

404
00:30:59,346 --> 00:31:02,631
Bill, it's Zane. I need to talk to you.

405
00:31:02,654 --> 00:31:05,231
[Bill] Open it nice and slow.

406
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:07,575
[door opening]

407
00:31:12,737 --> 00:31:14,031
What do you need?

408
00:31:17,102 --> 00:31:20,136
The only time you come up
here is when you need something.

409
00:31:21,683 --> 00:31:25,728
Are you just gonna stand there
or are you gonna introduce me?

410
00:31:27,195 --> 00:31:29,899
I'm sorry. Bill, this is Lara.

411
00:31:30,359 --> 00:31:33,460
Lara, this is Wild Bill Turner.

412
00:31:34,654 --> 00:31:37,326
What'd he do honey? Kidnap you?

413
00:31:42,531 --> 00:31:44,569
Anybody out there see you come in?

414
00:31:45,631 --> 00:31:46,915
No, nobody saw me.

415
00:31:46,938 --> 00:31:49,797
You never know who or what's
watching out there.

416
00:31:51,617 --> 00:31:53,215
How you been, Bill?

417
00:31:53,706 --> 00:31:56,108
Still trying to find a
reason for it all, son.

418
00:31:57,748 --> 00:31:59,200
Listen, Bill.

419
00:31:59,223 --> 00:32:00,899
[sighs] I'm in some pretty deep shit.

420
00:32:00,923 --> 00:32:02,503
I figured as much.

421
00:32:03,406 --> 00:32:06,487
I ain't got all night. Let me have it.

422
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:08,612
Well, let's just say I'm in the hole

423
00:32:08,636 --> 00:32:10,816
with some pretty heavy hitters.

424
00:32:10,987 --> 00:32:12,404
Give me the facts.

425
00:32:13,559 --> 00:32:16,879
Last night, a surprisingly
polite man with a gun

426
00:32:16,903 --> 00:32:19,467
told me I had thirty-six
hours to pay him or else.

427
00:32:20,005 --> 00:32:21,101
Or else what?

428
00:32:21,285 --> 00:32:22,639
[Zane] Or else I'll be short two kneecaps,

429
00:32:22,662 --> 00:32:24,051
what does it sound like?

430
00:32:24,354 --> 00:32:26,287
Then earlier this evening,
some foreign guy

431
00:32:26,311 --> 00:32:29,333
tries to turn me into a hood
ornament, my car explodes,

432
00:32:29,776 --> 00:32:31,633
she helps me out, we go back to my place,

433
00:32:31,656 --> 00:32:33,888
and some other asshole tries to kill me.

434
00:32:34,004 --> 00:32:35,004
Is that it?

435
00:32:35,151 --> 00:32:36,151
[chuckles]

436
00:32:36,426 --> 00:32:38,203
Then my house burned down.

437
00:32:38,624 --> 00:32:40,385
That's a pretty full day.

438
00:32:41,333 --> 00:32:42,926
How'd you know this guy was foreign?

439
00:32:43,026 --> 00:32:44,628
Eh, something he said to me.

440
00:32:44,651 --> 00:32:50,202
Uh, "Via Condio."

441
00:32:50,225 --> 00:32:51,908
[Lara]
It means "go with God."

442
00:32:53,485 --> 00:32:55,213
Eight years of catholic school.

443
00:32:55,345 --> 00:32:57,248
Why would he say something like that?

444
00:32:57,427 --> 00:32:58,828
What'd this guy look like?

445
00:33:00,014 --> 00:33:05,244
Dark hair, some dark
clothes on, gaunt features,

446
00:33:05,485 --> 00:33:07,657
I think he had a scar on his face, too.

447
00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:10,572
Is that it?

448
00:33:10,596 --> 00:33:12,103
And a rosary, why?

449
00:33:12,411 --> 00:33:13,509
Not sure.

450
00:33:13,804 --> 00:33:16,771
Let me make a few
calls, send out a few emails.

451
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:19,470
I'll see what we can
dig up on these clowns.

452
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,010
I should have some options
for you in the morning.

453
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:24,707
[Zane]
What do we do till then?

454
00:33:24,814 --> 00:33:27,296
Go down to the desk, tell Vino I sent you.

455
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,846
He'll know what to do.

456
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:30,710
Don't sign in.

457
00:33:30,936 --> 00:33:33,404
And don't talk to anyone.

458
00:33:34,622 --> 00:33:37,003
I'll call your room in the morning.

459
00:33:39,174 --> 00:33:40,794
I appreciate it, Bill.

460
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:52,150
[suspenseful music]

461
00:34:06,278 --> 00:34:08,267
[Zane] I'm starting
to think Phil was right.

462
00:34:08,563 --> 00:34:10,987
My life does seem to be
getting more interesting.

463
00:34:11,635 --> 00:34:14,225
Of course I finally get a day
worth writing about

464
00:34:14,388 --> 00:34:16,325
and I lose everything I own.

465
00:34:17,089 --> 00:34:20,081
Well, on the bright side,
I didn't lose any money.

466
00:34:21,072 --> 00:34:22,959
Maybe I'll have better luck tomorrow.

467
00:34:26,669 --> 00:34:27,725
This one?

468
00:34:28,521 --> 00:34:30,663
Yeah, that's fine.

469
00:34:48,998 --> 00:34:51,617
Hey, are you sure about this?

470
00:34:52,343 --> 00:34:55,466
[Lara] After the day we've had,
I really don't think I wanna be alone.

471
00:34:55,965 --> 00:34:57,139
Fair enough.

472
00:35:08,797 --> 00:35:09,915
Cute.

473
00:35:21,951 --> 00:35:23,281
What are you thinking about?

474
00:35:23,391 --> 00:35:25,558
Just trying to figure out how I got here.

475
00:35:26,473 --> 00:35:27,862
A motel?

476
00:35:27,886 --> 00:35:30,617
No. This point in my life.

477
00:35:30,641 --> 00:35:33,194
Jesus, you really have to stop
feeling sorry for yourself.

478
00:35:33,218 --> 00:35:35,074
Trust me, it could be worse.

479
00:35:35,544 --> 00:35:37,105
How?

480
00:35:39,523 --> 00:35:43,400
[sighs] So, what is Bill gonna do exactly?

481
00:35:43,424 --> 00:35:47,817
He's got a lot of good connections,
people we can trust.

482
00:35:47,841 --> 00:35:51,448
And he'll be careful.
He's a little paranoid.

483
00:35:52,007 --> 00:35:53,290
Understatement.

484
00:35:53,314 --> 00:35:55,249
Okay, a lot.

485
00:35:55,273 --> 00:35:57,765
But he also has his
ear to every conspiracy

486
00:35:57,789 --> 00:36:01,037
and two-bit operation that
goes on in this country.

487
00:36:01,061 --> 00:36:03,288
Do you really think
he'll be able to help us?

488
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:07,644
Yeah. He will.

489
00:36:19,771 --> 00:36:26,312
[tense music]

490
00:36:30,266 --> 00:36:34,097
[dramatic music]

491
00:37:30,989 --> 00:37:32,798
Everyone, this is it.

492
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:36,916
[TV sounds]

493
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:58,822
Zane, can you call down for more towels?
We don't have anymore.

494
00:37:59,128 --> 00:38:01,666
Yeah, sure.

495
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:04,847
[TV sounds]

496
00:38:10,468 --> 00:38:13,192
Yeah, hi. This is uh, room 202.

497
00:38:13,216 --> 00:38:16,283
We're out of towels.
Can we get a few more up here?

498
00:38:16,669 --> 00:38:18,780
Thank you, bye.

499
00:38:18,918 --> 00:38:21,292
[water falling on shower]

500
00:38:21,421 --> 00:38:22,981
They're on their way!

501
00:38:27,959 --> 00:38:30,623
[water falling]

502
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:47,309
[TV sounds]

503
00:38:55,379 --> 00:38:57,204
[people speaking indistinctly on TV]

504
00:38:57,484 --> 00:38:58,790
[news announcer] Part of a fire.

505
00:38:58,817 --> 00:39:02,913
But their investigation turned from arson
to murder with the discovery of a body.

506
00:39:02,937 --> 00:39:07,597
The body, tentatively identified as Zane
Stevens, the only resident of the house,

507
00:39:07,621 --> 00:39:09,422
was removed just hours ago.

508
00:39:09,446 --> 00:39:12,454
Police officials say they found
their first major piece of evidence,

509
00:39:12,478 --> 00:39:15,362
an answering machine tape in
the garbage early this morning.

510
00:39:15,386 --> 00:39:17,536
This is great!
I'm dead!

511
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:19,495
With this and other evidence in hand,

512
00:39:19,519 --> 00:39:23,340
the police arrested Holly Stevens,
the victim's estranged wife,

513
00:39:23,364 --> 00:39:24,920
just moments ago.

514
00:39:25,091 --> 00:39:28,932
When questioned about the surprising
speed of the investigation and arrest,

515
00:39:28,956 --> 00:39:32,126
district attorney Mackelroy
praised the local police force

516
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:33,834
for their speed and diligence.

517
00:39:33,858 --> 00:39:35,127
[door opens]

518
00:39:35,298 --> 00:39:36,315
That was fast.

519
00:39:36,339 --> 00:39:37,665
[Uno] Don't mention it.

520
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:43,544
Mr. G says,

521
00:39:43,568 --> 00:39:45,533
if you don't have his money,

522
00:39:45,557 --> 00:39:47,578
I'm allowed to use my own judgment

523
00:39:47,602 --> 00:39:50,030
as to how much pain to inflict upon you.

524
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:53,337
So, I'm gonna give you a little preview,

525
00:39:53,361 --> 00:39:56,833
just a little taste
of what I'm gonna do to you

526
00:39:56,857 --> 00:39:59,972
before we discuss whether
or not you have his money.

527
00:39:59,996 --> 00:40:01,712
[gasps] I can explain.

528
00:40:02,554 --> 00:40:04,209
Explain what?

529
00:40:04,233 --> 00:40:06,534
You've had two days to
get things together.

530
00:40:06,558 --> 00:40:11,681
You're a no call, no show,
soon to be nobody.

531
00:40:12,286 --> 00:40:13,842
[loud bang]

532
00:40:14,519 --> 00:40:16,689
This really upsets my employer

533
00:40:16,713 --> 00:40:18,947
and makes my job very unpleasant.

534
00:40:19,261 --> 00:40:22,266
[laughs]
Burning down your house.

535
00:40:22,290 --> 00:40:23,601
Do you really think

536
00:40:23,625 --> 00:40:26,541
you're the first person who ever
tried to fake his own death?

537
00:40:27,662 --> 00:40:29,144
Whoa, whoa, whoa,

538
00:40:29,173 --> 00:40:30,710
trying to make a run for it

539
00:40:30,731 --> 00:40:33,332
before we have a chance to
work things out man to man?

540
00:40:33,356 --> 00:40:34,885
[laughs]

541
00:40:34,909 --> 00:40:36,492
Where are your manners?

542
00:40:38,933 --> 00:40:41,359
You have no respect for social contracts.

543
00:40:41,392 --> 00:40:42,765
Wait!

544
00:40:43,431 --> 00:40:45,174
I hear you like bare knuckle fighting.

545
00:40:45,565 --> 00:40:47,265
[loud hit]
[panting]

546
00:40:57,593 --> 00:40:59,250
Now let's discuss the issue in question.

547
00:40:59,274 --> 00:41:01,107
The money, do you have it?

548
00:41:01,133 --> 00:41:02,490
I just need a little more time.

549
00:41:02,514 --> 00:41:04,464
[chuckles] Wrong answer!

550
00:41:06,303 --> 00:41:07,481
[violent hit]
[gasps]

551
00:41:07,887 --> 00:41:09,731
[tense music]

552
00:41:09,755 --> 00:41:11,499
[groans]

553
00:41:13,205 --> 00:41:14,255
[groans]

554
00:41:16,044 --> 00:41:17,610
[violent hits]

555
00:41:19,754 --> 00:41:20,763
[pot breaks]

556
00:41:22,612 --> 00:41:23,818
[hits the floor]

557
00:41:32,236 --> 00:41:33,236
[coughs]

558
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:34,890
[Lara]
Hey, who is this guy?

559
00:41:35,877 --> 00:41:37,754
[groans] Long story.

560
00:41:38,087 --> 00:41:39,526
How'd you do that?

561
00:41:39,661 --> 00:41:41,633
Eight years of Catholic school.

562
00:41:41,657 --> 00:41:43,296
We gotta get out of here now.

563
00:41:44,608 --> 00:41:48,640
[tense music]

564
00:41:54,908 --> 00:41:56,293
[Bill]
Knock, knock.

565
00:41:56,513 --> 00:41:58,189
Bill, open up, it's us.

566
00:41:58,483 --> 00:42:00,216
Anyone out there with you?

567
00:42:01,530 --> 00:42:03,834
- No.
- Slowly.

568
00:42:09,263 --> 00:42:10,943
You mind if I change?

569
00:42:17,905 --> 00:42:19,194
What's going on, Bill?

570
00:42:20,052 --> 00:42:21,600
It's worse than you think.

571
00:42:21,624 --> 00:42:24,440
Yeah, no shit.
That ape, Uno, just tried to kill me.

572
00:42:24,464 --> 00:42:26,463
What the hell is an Uno?

573
00:42:26,487 --> 00:42:29,468
Uh, he works for Giovanni.
He came to collect.

574
00:42:29,605 --> 00:42:31,058
Where is he now?

575
00:42:31,229 --> 00:42:33,279
- Tied up in the room.
- What?

576
00:42:33,409 --> 00:42:36,423
Yeah, Lara kicked his ass, tied him up.

577
00:42:36,784 --> 00:42:39,378
I just wanna know how he found me so easy.

578
00:42:41,830 --> 00:42:46,581
[Bill and Zane speak indistinctly]

579
00:42:48,346 --> 00:42:53,657
[Bill and Zane speak indistinctly]

580
00:42:56,342 --> 00:42:58,801
Something you said last
night got me to thinking.

581
00:43:06,122 --> 00:43:08,024
Does this guy look familiar?

582
00:43:08,093 --> 00:43:09,633
[dramatic music]

583
00:43:09,765 --> 00:43:11,253
Yeah. Yeah, that's him!

584
00:43:11,277 --> 00:43:14,101
That's the guy I bumped into in
the parking garage yesterday!

585
00:43:14,513 --> 00:43:17,239
Trouble is, he's not with the mob.

586
00:43:17,263 --> 00:43:19,432
- Whoa, he's not a hit man?
- No.

587
00:43:19,583 --> 00:43:22,772
He's a hit man, all right?
Just not with the mafia.

588
00:43:23,249 --> 00:43:25,103
I'm not following you, Bill.

589
00:43:25,127 --> 00:43:26,670
The Vatican.

590
00:43:27,331 --> 00:43:28,523
The Vatican?

591
00:43:28,547 --> 00:43:30,996
They call him The Bishop.

592
00:43:32,630 --> 00:43:34,091
I guess every now and then,

593
00:43:34,115 --> 00:43:36,490
God needs to clean house, too.

594
00:43:36,958 --> 00:43:40,045
So when they wanna excommunicate somebody,

595
00:43:40,232 --> 00:43:42,311
they call this guy.

596
00:43:42,428 --> 00:43:44,913
What are you telling me,
the fucking Pope wants me dead?

597
00:43:44,937 --> 00:43:46,998
No, they don't do that anymore.

598
00:43:47,259 --> 00:43:48,463
Why not?

599
00:43:48,683 --> 00:43:53,835
We're in an age of a kinder,
more gentler archdiocese.

600
00:43:54,143 --> 00:43:55,503
They don't whack every priest

601
00:43:55,527 --> 00:43:59,137
that doesn't know the difference
between good touch and bad touch.

602
00:43:59,161 --> 00:44:01,660
This guy was kicked out years ago.

603
00:44:02,581 --> 00:44:06,675
He took his job a little too seriously.

604
00:44:07,567 --> 00:44:10,065
He made more of a mess than
what he was trying to cover up!

605
00:44:10,089 --> 00:44:12,945
Murder, torture, he did it all!

606
00:44:13,556 --> 00:44:15,569
He worked for the church,

607
00:44:15,743 --> 00:44:19,501
but he might as well have
been the Devil himself.

608
00:44:22,785 --> 00:44:24,320
The church could only take so much,

609
00:44:24,344 --> 00:44:25,974
so they decided to cut him loose.

610
00:44:25,998 --> 00:44:28,523
And he decided to let
them know how he felt.

611
00:44:31,827 --> 00:44:32,866
[in Italian] Father...

612
00:44:33,362 --> 00:44:34,778
He confessed everything.

613
00:44:36,067 --> 00:44:37,975
[Bill] Everything they had him do.

614
00:44:38,876 --> 00:44:40,362
All of the murders.

615
00:44:40,723 --> 00:44:43,564
Every disturbing detail.

616
00:44:43,998 --> 00:44:45,613
[in Italian] Forgive me, father.

617
00:44:46,617 --> 00:44:47,617
[gunshot]

618
00:44:47,641 --> 00:44:49,269
Holy shit.

619
00:44:50,033 --> 00:44:51,868
Holy shit is right,

620
00:44:52,611 --> 00:44:54,349
but you ain't heard nothing yet.

621
00:44:55,929 --> 00:44:58,334
Guess one dead priest just wasn't enough,

622
00:44:58,358 --> 00:45:00,930
like putting a band-aid
over a bullet hole.

623
00:45:00,954 --> 00:45:03,514
[bell rings]

624
00:45:05,483 --> 00:45:12,701
[dramatic choral music]

625
00:45:23,642 --> 00:45:30,302
[dramatic choral music]

626
00:45:35,026 --> 00:45:42,659
[dramatic choral music]

627
00:45:55,259 --> 00:46:03,259
[dramatic choral music]

628
00:46:05,543 --> 00:46:07,445
[Bill] Hells Bells.

629
00:46:10,405 --> 00:46:12,380
Like the Devil himself.

630
00:46:15,485 --> 00:46:18,286
After that, he disappeared.

631
00:46:18,310 --> 00:46:22,375
Every few years, he pops up again,
leaves a trail of bodies in his wake,

632
00:46:22,399 --> 00:46:25,412
goes to the nearest parish,
confesses everything,

633
00:46:26,181 --> 00:46:30,548
kills the priest, and poof, he's gone.

634
00:46:31,623 --> 00:46:33,416
Oh my God.

635
00:46:33,698 --> 00:46:37,126
I don't think God had
anything to do with it.

636
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:39,969
Oh, you can't be serious, Bill.

637
00:46:40,341 --> 00:46:42,102
Dead serious.

638
00:46:42,594 --> 00:46:44,290
It only gets worse.

639
00:46:44,746 --> 00:46:48,651
Yep. He's not the only one.

640
00:46:49,077 --> 00:46:52,219
This kinda crazy shit's been
happening all over the world.

641
00:46:52,243 --> 00:46:56,312
That stuff that's happened to you,
you're not alone.

642
00:46:57,965 --> 00:47:03,485
[dramatic music]

643
00:47:06,528 --> 00:47:07,883
Look at these.

644
00:47:09,523 --> 00:47:11,977
New York, Miami, London, Prague.

645
00:47:12,001 --> 00:47:13,680
Man found burning!

646
00:47:13,704 --> 00:47:16,709
[Zane mumbles]

647
00:47:16,733 --> 00:47:18,488
There's like 20 cities here!

648
00:47:18,512 --> 00:47:20,242
[sighs] What the hell's going on, Bill?

649
00:47:20,761 --> 00:47:22,316
It's a game.

650
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:23,750
This is a game?

651
00:47:23,774 --> 00:47:24,980
Afraid so.

652
00:47:25,004 --> 00:47:26,376
Well, why would they want me?

653
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:27,827
No idea, but I do know

654
00:47:27,851 --> 00:47:30,423
there could be as much as a million
dollar price tag on your head

655
00:47:30,447 --> 00:47:31,931
to the one who bags you.

656
00:47:31,955 --> 00:47:33,308
Bags me?

657
00:47:33,332 --> 00:47:35,943
- What am I, a fucking deer?
- Oh yeah.

658
00:47:35,967 --> 00:47:38,355
It's a winner take all kinda thing.

659
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:40,973
If you can afford to put in, you can play.

660
00:47:40,997 --> 00:47:43,855
In Hungary last year,
they busted up two games just like this.

661
00:47:43,879 --> 00:47:46,401
Since then,
it's been showing up in the States.

662
00:47:46,425 --> 00:47:50,450
Face it, your ass has
a huge price tag on it.

663
00:47:50,771 --> 00:47:53,004
And if the mob don't get you, son,

664
00:47:53,463 --> 00:47:54,864
these guys might.

665
00:47:54,888 --> 00:47:56,240
[sighs]

666
00:47:56,747 --> 00:47:58,614
I think I'm gonna be sick.

667
00:47:58,638 --> 00:48:00,506
Look, I appreciate the accommodations,

668
00:48:00,530 --> 00:48:02,902
but I think it's time for me to leave.

669
00:48:02,926 --> 00:48:05,171
You're not going anywhere, doll face.

670
00:48:05,334 --> 00:48:06,467
Excuse me?

671
00:48:06,491 --> 00:48:07,759
If that thug found you,

672
00:48:07,783 --> 00:48:10,884
it's only a matter of time before
the other ones track you down.

673
00:48:10,908 --> 00:48:12,763
Oh, I think I can take care of myself.

674
00:48:12,787 --> 00:48:15,315
[Bill] You wouldn't get two miles,
not without my help.

675
00:48:15,817 --> 00:48:17,416
So what do we do?

676
00:48:17,948 --> 00:48:19,685
I'm gonna take us out of the country.

677
00:48:19,709 --> 00:48:22,459
- [Lara] Us?
- Yeah, us.

678
00:48:23,192 --> 00:48:26,323
It's only a matter of time
before the others come here

679
00:48:26,347 --> 00:48:28,274
and they're not exactly
gonna be neighborly

680
00:48:28,298 --> 00:48:29,864
when they ask me where you are.

681
00:48:29,888 --> 00:48:31,305
So I'm going, too.

682
00:48:31,499 --> 00:48:33,106
Why out of the country?

683
00:48:33,539 --> 00:48:36,703
Lie low for a while until
this whole thing blows over.

684
00:48:36,727 --> 00:48:38,722
Well, how long's a little while?

685
00:48:39,083 --> 00:48:40,367
Four or five years.

686
00:48:40,391 --> 00:48:41,391
[sighs]

687
00:48:41,415 --> 00:48:43,312
But first thing's first.

688
00:48:45,914 --> 00:48:48,063
You're gonna need these.

689
00:48:49,284 --> 00:48:51,388
We can't get out of
the country with those.

690
00:48:51,634 --> 00:48:52,658
Country?

691
00:48:52,886 --> 00:48:56,464
Honey, you're gonna need these
to get out of this motel room!

692
00:48:56,809 --> 00:48:58,387
Ah, shit!

693
00:48:58,688 --> 00:48:59,889
[Lara]
What?

694
00:48:59,913 --> 00:49:02,528
- I left my bag in the room.
- Leave it.

695
00:49:02,555 --> 00:49:04,379
Leave it? I cant leave it.
My book's in it!

696
00:49:04,403 --> 00:49:06,694
- So?
- So it's all I have left.

697
00:49:06,718 --> 00:49:08,841
Son, we don't have time.

698
00:49:08,865 --> 00:49:10,443
I'll be right back.

699
00:49:12,228 --> 00:49:13,795
You have one hour!

700
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:16,455
That boy's gonna get me killed.

701
00:49:20,166 --> 00:49:25,373
[ominous music]

702
00:49:30,951 --> 00:49:32,875
Can I help you?
[crunchy bite]

703
00:49:35,982 --> 00:49:37,968
[gunshots]

704
00:49:51,098 --> 00:49:52,382
This is the one.

705
00:49:55,472 --> 00:49:57,402
[in unison]
Mike Oxmall.

706
00:50:02,755 --> 00:50:04,399
[elevator bell rings]

707
00:50:29,139 --> 00:50:34,647
[tense music]

708
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,499
[mumbling]

709
00:50:55,328 --> 00:50:57,400
Enjoy your stay, big guy.

710
00:50:57,968 --> 00:50:59,007

01:12:39,858 --> 01:12:41,432
[knocking on door]

898
01:12:41,456 --> 01:12:42,744
Phil!

899
01:12:43,356 --> 01:12:45,520
[knocking on door]

900
01:12:45,544 --> 01:12:47,213
Jesus Christ oh m...

901
01:12:48,782 --> 01:12:50,275
You all right?

902
01:12:50,299 --> 01:12:51,557
[panting] No.

903
01:12:52,921 --> 01:12:54,726
You know I don't open
for another three hours.

904
01:12:54,750 --> 01:12:57,632
I know, but I desperately
need to use your phone.

905
01:12:58,249 --> 01:12:59,492
You look like shit!

906
01:12:59,516 --> 01:13:01,271
Eh, well I feel like shit.

907
01:13:01,295 --> 01:13:03,650
And I think I just stared
the devil in the face.

908
01:13:03,919 --> 01:13:05,378
- Can I get a beer?
- Yeah, sure.

909
01:13:09,714 --> 01:13:12,008
[tense music]

910
01:13:12,149 --> 01:13:14,194
Hey, you want me to call you an ambulance?

911
01:13:14,218 --> 01:13:15,712
I gotta check on something.

912
01:13:19,709 --> 01:13:20,846
[coin clinks]

913
01:13:28,862 --> 01:13:30,562
[phone bleeps]

914
01:13:32,858 --> 01:13:34,536
- [phone bleeps]

[phone rings]

919
01:14:11,011 --> 01:14:12,915
So tell me kid, what happened?

920
01:14:13,171 --> 01:14:14,318
Why me?

921
01:14:14,584 --> 01:14:16,523
- What?
- Why me?

922
01:14:17,638 --> 01:14:20,063
What are you talking about, man?

923
01:14:20,461 --> 01:14:22,445
[yelling]
Why me?

924
01:14:23,362 --> 01:14:25,134
[chuckles]

925
01:14:28,134 --> 01:14:29,930
Nothing personal, kid.

926
01:14:32,259 --> 01:14:34,258
Strictly a monetary thing.

927
01:14:34,754 --> 01:14:36,324
That's sick.

928
01:14:36,962 --> 01:14:40,036
Maybe so, but it pays well.

929
01:14:40,837 --> 01:14:42,634
You've been running this
thing the whole time?

930
01:14:42,657 --> 01:14:45,222
No, no, no, I'm not the mastermind.

931
01:14:45,246 --> 01:14:48,006
I'm the coordinator slash referee.

932
01:14:48,267 --> 01:14:49,853
I pick out the hunters,

933
01:14:50,073 --> 01:14:53,558
I select the kill, I secure the purse,

934
01:14:53,582 --> 01:14:54,900
various other details,

935
01:14:54,924 --> 01:14:56,030
but most of all,

936
01:14:56,054 --> 01:14:59,524
I get 25 percent of the cash prize!

937
01:15:00,441 --> 01:15:03,750
Come on horse,
don't stand there with that long face.

938
01:15:03,912 --> 01:15:06,539
You are one sick son of a bitch, Phil.

939
01:15:06,956 --> 01:15:10,127
I'm about to offer you
the chance of a lifetime.

940
01:15:10,304 --> 01:15:12,588
Since you're standing
right here in front of me,

941
01:15:12,612 --> 01:15:14,750
I assume everyone else is dead.

942
01:15:15,005 --> 01:15:17,281
That means the purse is yours!

943
01:15:23,634 --> 01:15:25,607
Minus my cut, of course.

944
01:15:25,804 --> 01:15:28,225
You stripped me of my life!

945
01:15:28,249 --> 01:15:30,290
You said your life sucked!

946
01:15:30,314 --> 01:15:31,376
Maybe,

947
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:36,090
but that does not give you the right
to play judge, jury and executioner!

948
01:15:36,114 --> 01:15:37,879
You stupid pathetic loser,

949
01:15:37,903 --> 01:15:39,735
you're the one to come
in here whining to me,

950
01:15:39,759 --> 01:15:43,269
"Oh, my life's over.
Oh, I got a gambling problem."

951
01:15:44,254 --> 01:15:45,701
Fuck you.

952
01:15:45,725 --> 01:15:47,605
Fuck me?
No, fuck you!

953
01:15:47,629 --> 01:15:51,340
I don't go out and air my dirty
laundry to anyone who asks!

954
01:15:51,575 --> 01:15:52,585
You know what?

955
01:15:52,609 --> 01:15:54,589
If we didn't put you out of your misery,

956
01:15:54,613 --> 01:15:56,537
somebody else would!

957
01:15:56,859 --> 01:15:58,167
You don't know me.

958
01:15:58,191 --> 01:15:59,671
I know you, kid.

959
01:15:59,695 --> 01:16:03,283
I know you for the weak,
scared bitch that you are.

960
01:16:03,307 --> 01:16:07,219
And I definitely know you don't
have the balls to pull that trigger.

961
01:16:08,927 --> 01:16:13,000
[tense music]

962
01:16:13,185 --> 01:16:14,805

963

[gunshot]
[glass breaks]

965
01:16:24,754 --> 01:16:27,286
This game's over, buddy boy!

966
01:16:27,310 --> 01:16:28,712
[gunshot]

967
01:16:29,290 --> 01:16:31,025
- Son of a bitch!
- [cocks gun]

968
01:16:33,184 --> 01:16:34,679
You!

969
01:16:35,032 --> 01:16:37,578
[gunshots]

970
01:16:37,602 --> 01:16:38,903
[retches]

971
01:16:41,285 --> 01:16:42,683
[alcohol pours]

972
01:16:44,618 --> 01:16:47,102
[groans] Twisted sex!

973
01:16:47,126 --> 01:16:50,273
[laughs] And I'm on top!

974
01:16:51,838 --> 01:16:53,831
Do you know who she is, kid?

975
01:16:54,170 --> 01:16:56,716
[gunshots]
[bullet shells hit the ground]

976
01:17:02,031 --> 01:17:05,941
[tense music]

977
01:17:15,162 --> 01:17:17,332
[alcohol pours]

978
01:17:19,861 --> 01:17:21,542
I thought you were dead!

979
01:17:24,003 --> 01:17:25,230
You okay?

980
01:17:28,007 --> 01:17:29,203
Look what we got!

981
01:17:30,483 --> 01:17:32,007
I don't think so.

982
01:17:32,976 --> 01:17:34,432
We can share the money.

983
01:17:34,456 --> 01:17:37,059
The rules don't say
anything about sharing.

984
01:17:38,130 --> 01:17:39,630
The rules?

985
01:17:43,391 --> 01:17:44,892
Oh, fuck me.

986
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,248
So you're playing too?

987
01:17:50,652 --> 01:17:52,184
Why'd you help me?

988
01:17:52,935 --> 01:17:54,268
I don't know.

989
01:17:55,496 --> 01:17:58,372
I guess you could say I like
to play from the inside out.

990
01:17:58,893 --> 01:18:01,047
It's much more exciting that way.

991
01:18:01,506 --> 01:18:04,193
It's easy to win when
you're the only player left.

992
01:18:04,217 --> 01:18:05,873
And trust me...

993
01:18:06,374 --> 01:18:07,447
[strikes match]

994
01:18:07,679 --> 01:18:09,696
I've been playing them all along.

995
01:18:10,166 --> 01:18:11,576
And you.

996
01:18:12,488 --> 01:18:14,422
So that's how they found us so easy?

997
01:18:15,860 --> 01:18:17,060
By the way,

998
01:18:17,516 --> 01:18:19,339
I wanna thank you for all your help.

999
01:18:19,555 --> 01:18:21,439
I couldn't have done it without you.

1000
01:18:26,133 --> 01:18:27,421
Or your friend.

1001
01:18:31,168 --> 01:18:34,539
Lara... bitch.

1002
01:18:35,152 --> 01:18:36,330
What the hell?

1003
01:18:37,136 --> 01:18:39,235
- [gunshot]
- You know?

1004
01:18:39,259 --> 01:18:40,575
It's a shame.

1005
01:18:40,883 --> 01:18:42,285
I really liked Bill.

1006
01:18:42,309 --> 01:18:43,486
[strikes match]

1007
01:18:44,679 --> 01:18:47,238
You had every opportunity to kill me.

1008
01:18:47,262 --> 01:18:48,669
Why now?

1009
01:18:49,411 --> 01:18:50,723
[strikes match]

1010
01:18:53,610 --> 01:18:57,243
Because I like to play with
my food before I eat it.

[tense music]

1022
01:19:43,312 --> 01:19:45,906
There's only one way out of here, Zane!

1023
01:19:48,808 --> 01:19:50,531
That's through me.

1024
01:19:51,803 --> 01:19:56,035

[tense music]

1029
01:21:12,515 --> 01:21:14,951
[Zane] Why don't you just
take the money and leave?

1030
01:21:14,975 --> 01:21:17,025
It's not gonna be that easy.

1031
01:21:19,063 --> 01:21:20,693
[Zane] Screw you, bitch!

1032

[tense music]

1039
01:21:54,816 --> 01:21:56,132
Nice touch.

1040
01:21:56,443 --> 01:21:57,662
Thank you.

1041
01:21:58,447 --> 01:22:00,739
So this is how your
little book's gonna end?

1042
01:22:00,763 --> 01:22:03,164
Hero saves the day and gets the bad guy?

1043
01:22:03,566 --> 01:22:05,982
Yeah, that's the idea.

1044
01:22:06,006 --> 01:22:10,069
I think it ends with me splattering
your brains all over the fucking wall.

1045
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:12,538
Yeah, why's that?

1046
01:22:13,004 --> 01:22:15,890
Because I never gave you
the bullets for that gun.

1047

01:22:34,257 --> 01:22:35,872
I rewrote the ending.

1051
01:22:39,114 --> 01:22:42,372
[Zane] Sometimes, you do your
best work under pressure.

Sir, do you have a reservation?

1061
01:24:12,623 --> 01:24:13,899
No.

1062
01:24:20,508 --> 01:24:23,103
Uno, is this the gentleman you spoke of?

1063
01:24:23,279 --> 01:24:25,014
Yes sir, it is.

1064
01:24:25,289 --> 01:24:27,402
I want you to behave yourself, understood?

1065
01:24:28,260 --> 01:24:29,414
Yes, sir.

1066
01:24:33,006 --> 01:24:37,518
[upbeat jazz music]

1067
01:24:45,085 --> 01:24:46,721
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

1068
01:24:48,732 --> 01:24:50,436
What the hell happened to you?

1069
01:24:52,808 --> 01:24:55,442
[sighs] Lost a fight.

1070
01:25:00,808 --> 01:25:02,925
So, to what do I owe this pleasure?

1071
01:25:04,208 --> 01:25:05,655
Mr. Giovanni...

1072
01:25:05,923 --> 01:25:07,511
Mr. G is fine.

1073
01:25:08,818 --> 01:25:12,052
Sir, I've come to make
good on my contract.

1074
01:25:22,730 --> 01:25:26,380
Why should I accept this
after all the trauma you put me through?

1075
01:25:32,347 --> 01:25:37,537
I was hoping this little extra would
put any differences we have aside.

1076
01:25:38,201 --> 01:25:39,551
Agreed.

1077
01:25:46,684 --> 01:25:48,481
It's a nice place you have here.

1078
01:25:49,361 --> 01:25:52,137
You ever wanna make a bet,
you know who to come to.

1079
01:25:53,287 --> 01:25:56,706
Thanks sir,
but I think I've given up gambling.

[hopeful music]

1081
01:26:06,794 --> 01:26:10,444
[Zane] Action, adventure,
and happy endings.

1082
01:26:10,468 --> 01:26:13,984
That's what great stories are made of.

1083
01:26:25,019 --> 01:26:33,019
[light percussive music]

1084
01:26:54,041 --> 01:26:56,816
[Zane] I've always heard that
great writers write what they know.

1085
01:27:01,440 --> 01:27:04,052
I don't know any great writers,
but I do know this.

1086
01:27:04,310 --> 01:27:07,931
Sometimes writer's block
can be your best friend.
