00:00:02,789 --> 00:00:06,749
**Some words used in this movie have been written
as they are said, as they are fictitious words ***

3
00:00:24,657 --> 00:00:27,924
- As the eternal cycle of
day and night continued,

4
00:00:27,948 --> 00:00:32,929
morning light unveiled the ravages
of time self-inflicted calamity.

5
00:00:33,758 --> 00:00:38,714
A world that was nothing more than a baring
indecent of rock floating in space.

6
00:00:39,391 --> 00:00:42,791
Then came the thundering
engines of the scout ship

7
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:48,789
bringing the first echoing sounds in over a
million of years, to this arid landscape.

8
00:00:49,891 --> 00:00:54,491
For the celestial explorers, this
was just another place to chart.

9
00:00:54,516 --> 00:00:59,196
Catalogue and investigate, like the
thousands that had come before it.

10
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:01,723
They hoped to find something.

11
00:01:02,454 --> 00:01:04,187
Evidence of life, perhaps.

12
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:10,835
An ancient fossil signified that
life had existed here, long ago.

13
00:01:11,915 --> 00:01:15,156
Then, the faint signal
emanating form their device

14
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:19,650
posed a question: Was this the
product of an unknown intelligence?

15
00:01:22,258 --> 00:01:24,736
They followed the signal,
which grew stronger,

16
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:29,513
their scans indicating that just ahead
was an object of massive proportions.

17
00:01:39,171 --> 00:01:42,069
Kneeling over the source of
the signal, they carefully

18
00:01:42,094 --> 00:01:44,517
brushed back the sand
and discovered a hatch.

19
00:01:45,641 --> 00:01:46,641
But to what?

20
00:01:52,326 --> 00:01:56,054
Once the handle was carefully
turned, the hatch opened.

21
00:02:01,083 --> 00:02:03,825
Musty light led into the dark abyss

22
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:08,043
exposing hundreds of metallic
pods lining the chamber walls.

23
00:02:12,553 --> 00:02:14,570
Their fellow travelers were beckoned.

24
00:02:15,889 --> 00:02:18,444
And today, a wonderment
of the parts contain

25
00:02:18,469 --> 00:02:20,829
the remnants of a long
lost civilization.

26
00:02:20,853 --> 00:02:25,909
Affirming that this third planet from
its sun was once abundant with life.

27
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:30,378
With the impending end of their world
their parts have been engineered

28
00:02:30,402 --> 00:02:33,247
in the hope that they would
one day be discovered.

29
00:02:34,864 --> 00:02:39,931
In the living embryonic lifeforms induced
with state of suspended animation

30
00:02:39,955 --> 00:02:43,034
would somehow be reborn into a new world.

31
00:02:44,253 --> 00:02:48,243
For the inhabitants of this
new world once known as earth,

32
00:02:48,806 --> 00:02:51,107
it would be a new beginning.

33
00:02:51,131 --> 00:02:53,883
Anew age for mankind.

34
00:02:54,407 --> 00:02:55,740
Humanity would live,

35
00:02:57,219 --> 00:02:58,219
once again.

36
00:03:05,221 --> 00:03:07,524
- Evidences are roaming
that there's a coverup,

37
00:03:07,549 --> 00:03:09,712
and that there are aliens
visiting and so forth.

38
00:03:09,752 --> 00:03:14,350
I...I think we do need to recognize
a new era has begun for mankind.

39
00:03:14,374 --> 00:03:17,302
- I happen to be privileged
enough to be in on the

40
00:03:17,327 --> 00:03:20,053
fact that we have been
visited on this planet.

41
00:03:20,078 --> 00:03:22,814
And the UFO phenomenon is
real, although it's been

42
00:03:22,838 --> 00:03:25,359
covered up by governments
for quite a long time.

43
00:03:25,384 --> 00:03:27,175
The United States government
knew a whole lot more

44
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,021
about UFOs than it was
telling the American public.

45
00:03:30,045 --> 00:03:34,015
There's an intelligence involved that
there was a highly evolved technology

46
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:37,858
that to a degree we were carrying a
dialogue with this intelligence.

47
00:03:37,882 --> 00:03:43,136
- 'Cause I read NATO military material that
indicated that the UFOs were not only real,

48
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:47,465
they represented something far beyond
anything I had ever imagined before.

49
00:04:36,774 --> 00:04:40,055
-Could I get...$60 on pump four, please?

50
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:42,079
- Sure.
- Thanks.

51
00:04:42,508 --> 00:04:44,951
I understand over the years...

52
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:48,023
some peculiar things have been
happening around these parts.

53
00:04:48,157 --> 00:04:49,687
Cattle mutilations,

54
00:04:49,828 --> 00:04:52,351
strange lights in the
sky, things of that sort.

55
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,375
-No, I don't know anything about that.

56
00:04:54,898 --> 00:04:55,898
-Really?

57
00:04:57,116 --> 00:04:58,116
Okay.

58
00:04:59,351 --> 00:05:01,374
Set to go? - Yes, sir.

59
00:05:37,898 --> 00:05:39,446
-Son of a bitch.

60
00:06:59,912 --> 00:07:00,912
Yes..

61
00:07:31,737 --> 00:07:33,604
-May I ask why you chose me?

62
00:07:34,885 --> 00:07:37,685
I've known who you are for some time now,

63
00:07:37,854 --> 00:07:39,721
you seem like an honest man.

64
00:07:40,299 --> 00:07:41,954
-I'm all about the truth.

65
00:07:43,377 --> 00:07:46,777
And if what you're about
to tell me is the truth,

66
00:07:48,282 --> 00:07:50,992
am I to understand we're
all in a very grave danger?

67
00:07:51,797 --> 00:07:52,797
-Yes.

68
00:07:53,696 --> 00:07:55,278
In five days,

69
00:07:55,883 --> 00:07:57,950
human existence as you know it,

70
00:07:58,414 --> 00:07:59,747
will forever change.

71
00:08:04,024 --> 00:08:06,357
-Why don't we start with your name?

72
00:08:06,571 --> 00:08:07,571
-Jaelen.

73
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:09,821
-Jaelen?

74
00:08:11,579 --> 00:08:13,179
So, Jaelen, who are you?

75
00:09:26,736 --> 00:09:29,424
You're speaking of the
Phoenix Lights incident?

76
00:09:30,283 --> 00:09:32,626
Are you trying to tell
me you were aboard that craft?

77
00:09:34,134 --> 00:09:35,134
-Yes.

78
00:09:35,634 --> 00:09:37,743
-And where may I ask are you from, Jaelen?

79
00:09:38,424 --> 00:09:41,291
- A star system in the
constellation Zanaté.

80
00:09:42,102 --> 00:09:43,102
I'm Andromaden.

81
00:10:05,249 --> 00:10:06,249
We were six.

82
00:10:07,351 --> 00:10:10,018
Our task was to monitor human conditions

83
00:10:11,194 --> 00:10:13,241
and to determine the
degree of infiltration.

84
00:10:13,929 --> 00:10:15,959
-Infiltration by whom?

85
00:10:16,133 --> 00:10:17,333
-Alpha Draconians.

86
00:10:18,172 --> 00:10:19,172
-Draconians?

87
00:10:20,789 --> 00:10:24,163
- Andromadens are one of
139 planetary systems

88
00:10:24,188 --> 00:10:27,194
that comprise the
interstellar alliance.

89
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:30,035
We are and have always
been the watchdogs of

90
00:10:30,059 --> 00:10:32,577
the universe for nearly
two million years.

91
00:10:32,601 --> 00:10:36,816
And we have been at war with the Draconians
for nearly 100, 000 of those years.

92
00:10:36,971 --> 00:10:38,838
They are a malevolent species

93
00:10:39,568 --> 00:10:42,768
whose prime directive is
to conquer and destroy.

94
00:10:44,037 --> 00:10:46,846
Entire star systems have been
wiped out by their aggression.

95
00:10:46,871 --> 00:10:50,197
- And now we've become a target?
- You've always been a target.

96
00:10:50,277 --> 00:10:53,589
Three million of your population
are comprised of these beings.

97
00:10:53,815 --> 00:10:57,948
They are the one percent that control
corporations, government, media...

98
00:10:57,995 --> 00:11:01,366
Years ago, the nation's leader
struck a deal with the Draconians.

99
00:11:01,534 --> 00:11:05,738
In exchange for global control,
virtual enslavement of your people,

100
00:11:06,283 --> 00:11:09,665
a selected few would be granted
amnesty from the coming onslaught.

101
00:11:09,689 --> 00:11:12,745
They would be allowed to live out
their existence underground,

102
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:15,210
many have already begun to do so.

103
00:11:15,362 --> 00:11:18,910
- And this onslaught, is this
what's gonna happen in five days?

104
00:11:20,687 --> 00:11:25,428
- Two days ago, a Draconian warship reached
the outer rim of your solar system.

105
00:11:25,976 --> 00:11:28,710
Their army is coming here to
establish complete dominion.

106
00:11:29,578 --> 00:11:33,325
It has always been our intent
to shield you from this threat.

107
00:11:33,832 --> 00:11:36,046
But we are entrenched in
war and we haven't the

108
00:11:36,071 --> 00:11:38,192
means to bring the fleet
here to protect you.

109
00:11:39,856 --> 00:11:41,789
It is to be your darkest age.

110
00:11:51,581 --> 00:11:52,772
As I promised.

111
00:11:54,346 --> 00:11:57,451
It's documents, photos,
videos and maps

112
00:11:57,978 --> 00:12:01,074
of every secret military
underground base on the planet.

113
00:12:01,107 --> 00:12:04,626
And plus complete data base of
all occupants of those bases.

114
00:12:06,362 --> 00:12:09,049
- And you believe that this is
enough to convince the public?

115
00:12:11,964 --> 00:12:13,275
-Regardless.

116
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:16,410
In five days, they will all believe.

117
00:12:29,026 --> 00:12:31,910
- And you mention there
wasn't an excuse for it?

118
00:12:31,934 --> 00:12:33,229
-Jaelen!

119
00:12:36,214 --> 00:12:38,284
-Please stop it.

120
00:12:55,922 --> 00:12:56,922
Stop it!

121
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:13,891
-I don't know any of it.

122
00:13:16,096 --> 00:13:17,096
Just please...

123
00:13:24,715 --> 00:13:26,552
-Where is he?

124
00:13:27,254 --> 00:13:28,254
Where?

125
00:13:30,207 --> 00:13:33,262
- I'm special agent John Walker
here on government business.

126
00:13:33,286 --> 00:13:35,286
May I borrow a pen and
a piece of paper?

127
00:13:35,973 --> 00:13:36,973
-Sure.

128
00:13:37,512 --> 00:13:38,512
-Thank you.

129
00:13:39,192 --> 00:13:42,616
The gentleman in room 15 is
under my protective custody.

130
00:13:43,005 --> 00:13:44,757
There are people looking for him.

131
00:13:45,012 --> 00:13:46,412
If anyone should come

132
00:13:46,637 --> 00:13:49,983
inquiring, I'd appreciate
if you'd give me a call.

133
00:13:50,505 --> 00:13:52,799
It's a mater of national security, you see?

134
00:13:53,834 --> 00:13:54,834
-Okay.

135
00:13:55,498 --> 00:13:56,498
-Thank you.

136
00:14:24,328 --> 00:14:25,861
Are you feeling better?

137
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:29,005
You gonna tell me what happened?

138
00:14:29,263 --> 00:14:30,263
-Not now.

139
00:14:31,232 --> 00:14:32,232
-Okay.

140
00:14:32,935 --> 00:14:34,068
-What time is it?

141
00:14:34,888 --> 00:14:36,240
-It's... uh... half past three.

142
00:14:36,646 --> 00:14:38,246
- We need to go.
- Where?

143
00:14:39,818 --> 00:14:41,818
- We're meeting someone.
- Who?

144
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:43,920
-A friend.

145
00:14:52,522 --> 00:14:55,986
- You mentioned that there were six of you.
Where are the others?

146
00:14:58,092 --> 00:14:59,092
-Gone.

147
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:02,183
-As in left or died?

148
00:15:03,459 --> 00:15:04,459
-Died.

149
00:15:06,553 --> 00:15:10,286
- Well, I'm very sorry.
- We were hunted down one by one.

150
00:15:12,058 --> 00:15:14,058
All that they died for is this.

151
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:15,980
It's a Purean.

152
00:15:17,379 --> 00:15:20,712
It contains a collective
data of human progression

153
00:15:20,733 --> 00:15:23,083
as well as Draconian war plans.

154
00:15:23,397 --> 00:15:26,629
Information that could be very helpful
in our cause in overcoming them.

155
00:15:26,897 --> 00:15:29,201
- And how are you gonna
get that to your people?

156
00:15:30,882 --> 00:15:33,366
- A rescue ship arrives tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?

157
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:34,679
-At sun fall.

158
00:15:35,874 --> 00:15:37,340
-So you're going home?

159
00:15:38,827 --> 00:15:39,827
-No.

160
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:41,850
I'm not.

161
00:15:45,225 --> 00:15:46,425
Turn left up here.

162
00:16:13,615 --> 00:16:14,615
Your camera.

163
00:16:50,869 --> 00:16:53,032
-Your friend, is he...

164
00:16:53,369 --> 00:16:54,369
-From here?

165
00:16:55,127 --> 00:16:56,127
No.

166
00:16:56,713 --> 00:16:58,175
She's Arctorian.

167
00:17:01,846 --> 00:17:04,858
- I don't think I've ever
met an Arctorian before.

168
00:17:05,963 --> 00:17:08,252
Is she part of this
interstellar alliance?

169
00:17:09,112 --> 00:17:10,112
-They are.

170
00:17:11,065 --> 00:17:12,798
-Are they here to help us?

171
00:17:13,768 --> 00:17:14,768
-Very much so.

172
00:17:16,378 --> 00:17:17,378
-Good.

173
00:17:18,893 --> 00:17:19,893
That's good.

174
00:17:44,946 --> 00:17:45,946
-They're here.

175
00:17:51,329 --> 00:17:52,329
-My God.

176
00:19:02,612 --> 00:19:04,033
-This is Robert.

177
00:19:05,862 --> 00:19:07,978
- The one you spoke?
- Yes.

178
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:16,880
- I am Tonjura. I am
pleased to meet you.

179
00:19:19,202 --> 00:19:20,936
-It's an honor to meet you.

180
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,893
- We would like to extend
our deepest regret.

181
00:19:25,014 --> 00:19:27,424
We cannot help you in this matter.

182
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,893
We are not a violent species.

183
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,337
And not equipped for war.

184
00:19:33,241 --> 00:19:35,127
I'm sorry, Robert.

185
00:20:51,069 --> 00:20:55,669
- The Arktorians have always been here.
Silently monitoring human progress,

186
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:57,946
along with several other races.

187
00:20:59,381 --> 00:21:01,714
But now they're all returning home.

188
00:21:02,568 --> 00:21:03,968
-You mean evacuating?

189
00:21:06,787 --> 00:21:08,587
So now we really are alone.

190
00:21:11,037 --> 00:21:12,037
-Yes.

191
00:21:17,326 --> 00:21:20,652
Thousands of years of
accumulated human data

192
00:21:21,248 --> 00:21:22,248
ends here.

193
00:21:30,798 --> 00:21:33,329
- You could have gone back with them.
Why didn't you?

194
00:21:33,353 --> 00:21:35,353
Or at least given them the Purian.

195
00:21:38,055 --> 00:21:40,328
- They've fulfilled their
duties to the council.

196
00:21:41,094 --> 00:21:42,694
This is not one of them.

197
00:21:45,079 --> 00:21:47,745
And as I stated before, I'm not leaving.

198
00:22:33,875 --> 00:22:34,875
-Is this John?

199
00:22:34,945 --> 00:22:38,355
John Walker?
- Yes, yes, this is John Walker.

200
00:22:38,379 --> 00:22:42,250
- It's Denise from the motel. You
told me to call if anyone came inquiring.

201
00:22:42,275 --> 00:22:45,007
Well, there are government agents
inside this room as we speak.

202
00:22:45,031 --> 00:22:46,802
Well, you didn't tell
them anything, did you?

203
00:22:46,827 --> 00:22:49,528
- No. I didn't. But these
guys have real badges.

204
00:22:49,552 --> 00:22:51,552
-Denise, I owe you big.

205
00:22:52,984 --> 00:22:55,302
There's government agents
in your room right now.

206
00:22:55,465 --> 00:22:58,449
Somehow they knew we were there.
Any idea how?

207
00:22:59,894 --> 00:23:00,894
-Yes.

208
00:23:02,519 --> 00:23:06,705
- Alright, We're gonna have to ditch this
car and hitch a ride into Albuquerque,

209
00:23:06,729 --> 00:23:09,702
- What's in Albuquerque?
- A friend.

210
00:24:02,785 --> 00:24:05,663
Whatever it is you're not telling
me, Jaelen, I need to know.

211
00:24:05,862 --> 00:24:07,361
We're running out of time.

212
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:18,260
-I was compelled by her.

213
00:24:21,136 --> 00:24:24,204
I began experiencing feelings
I never had before.

214
00:24:25,511 --> 00:24:27,578
As if I were meant to find her.

215
00:24:28,433 --> 00:24:31,620
I felt myself avoiding better
judgment that this was wrong.

216
00:24:32,113 --> 00:24:34,518
A forbidden code of
conduct in my task here.

217
00:24:36,011 --> 00:24:39,078
I allowed it to happen,
I wanted it to happen.

218
00:24:42,253 --> 00:24:45,453
Andromedans enforce a very
structured mating ritual.

219
00:24:46,202 --> 00:24:50,002
A choice for companion is never
our own and never random.

220
00:24:50,178 --> 00:24:52,711
We're conditioned this way from birth.

221
00:24:52,936 --> 00:24:55,525
Therefore there is never
the opportunity for...

222
00:24:55,631 --> 00:24:56,764
-Falling in love?

223
00:25:00,209 --> 00:25:01,209
-Yes.

224
00:25:02,053 --> 00:25:04,195
- But did she know the
truth about you?

225
00:25:04,694 --> 00:25:05,935
-I didn't have the time.

226
00:25:09,131 --> 00:25:12,331
But I couldn't stay in one
place for to long, so

227
00:25:13,295 --> 00:25:15,365
the day approached when
I had to tell her.

228
00:25:19,761 --> 00:25:22,428
I haven't been entirely
honest with you.

229
00:25:24,253 --> 00:25:25,453
-What do you mean?

230
00:25:28,052 --> 00:25:30,208
-There are people looking for me.

231
00:25:31,255 --> 00:25:33,189
- Who's looking for you?
Do you need any help?

232
00:25:36,911 --> 00:25:38,178
-I'm not from here.

233
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:41,539
I'm not from Los Angeles,

234
00:25:42,697 --> 00:25:45,030
and I'm not from the United States.

235
00:25:47,775 --> 00:25:49,529
I'm not from earth.

236
00:25:51,822 --> 00:25:52,891
The people looking for me

237
00:25:53,384 --> 00:25:54,584
are getting close.

238
00:25:55,343 --> 00:25:58,885
They also are not from earth.

239
00:26:02,304 --> 00:26:03,304
-What do you...

240
00:26:04,797 --> 00:26:07,280
What do you mean you're not from earth?

241
00:26:07,305 --> 00:26:09,305
I don't...
- Listen, I care about you deeply.

242
00:26:09,329 --> 00:26:11,741
- Then why are you telling me?
- To protect you.

243
00:26:12,742 --> 00:26:13,742
-Uh... your

244
00:26:14,218 --> 00:26:18,265
...association with me, I fear I'm
putting you in danger as well.

245
00:26:20,410 --> 00:26:21,410
-Danger?

246
00:26:22,356 --> 00:26:23,356
How can you...

247
00:26:25,425 --> 00:26:28,170
how can you expect me to believe this?

248
00:26:28,348 --> 00:26:29,348
Please, just...

249
00:26:30,067 --> 00:26:31,333
make me understand.

250
00:26:35,988 --> 00:26:36,988
-Alyssa...

251
00:26:38,074 --> 00:26:39,341
there are things...

252
00:26:40,941 --> 00:26:44,741
there are worlds outside of
this one you have no idea of.

253
00:26:46,585 --> 00:26:48,852
And I am from one of these worlds.

254
00:27:13,101 --> 00:27:14,890
I knew I would never
see her again.

255
00:27:16,531 --> 00:27:17,664
I was devastated.

256
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:22,893
But we are more connected
than I even imagined.

257
00:27:24,018 --> 00:27:27,921
She could hear my thoughts. She
could feel my pain in losing her.

258
00:27:28,502 --> 00:27:30,702
-You were... telepathically linked?

259
00:27:31,354 --> 00:27:32,354
-Yes.

260
00:27:33,463 --> 00:27:36,063
Without my intention. It just happened.

261
00:27:36,494 --> 00:27:40,118
Soon, we found each other again, and
we left together, heading west.

262
00:27:40,651 --> 00:27:43,577
- Then what happened?
- My worst fear.

263
00:27:45,568 --> 00:27:46,568
They found us.

264
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:51,326
I managed to get away unharmed,
but she was not so fortunate.

265
00:27:51,888 --> 00:27:53,755
-So you're saying that

266
00:27:53,943 --> 00:27:56,028
she's... - Dead?

267
00:27:56,084 --> 00:27:57,084
No.

268
00:27:58,506 --> 00:27:59,706
But they took her.

269
00:28:00,513 --> 00:28:02,246
-Do you know where she is?

270
00:28:04,841 --> 00:28:07,677
- She's a prisoner underground
at the Base of Dulce.

271
00:28:10,325 --> 00:28:12,219
And they have been torturing her.

272
00:28:13,166 --> 00:28:17,899
- So the telepathic link between the
two of you is how they tracked you?

273
00:28:18,377 --> 00:28:19,377
-Yes.

274
00:28:22,181 --> 00:28:23,181
-Look... uh...

275
00:28:25,068 --> 00:28:27,852
I have no idea what you must
be going through right now.

276
00:28:31,318 --> 00:28:32,928
You never told me her name.

277
00:28:33,873 --> 00:28:35,206
-Her name is Alyssa.

278
00:28:38,381 --> 00:28:40,048
And she carries my child.

279
00:29:54,706 --> 00:29:58,573
- I've been an associate of
Chayton's since the early 90's.

280
00:29:58,698 --> 00:30:01,983
He's devoted his life to
researching anomalous phenomenon

281
00:30:02,007 --> 00:30:04,971
has established a strong
following in the UFO arena.

282
00:30:05,307 --> 00:30:07,126
He was one of the
first to get hold of

283
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:09,829
the secret flying disk file of the FBI

284
00:30:09,971 --> 00:30:12,738
and sensitive documents
from the CIA, air force,

285
00:30:12,763 --> 00:30:15,349
army and other
government agencies.

286
00:30:16,662 --> 00:30:19,058
The price he's paid for being
the truth to the public

287
00:30:19,083 --> 00:30:22,639
are death threats, imprisonment
and getting shot at.

288
00:30:22,912 --> 00:30:24,045
He is a good man,

289
00:30:24,959 --> 00:30:25,959
and I trust him

290
00:30:26,537 --> 00:30:27,937
as I would a brother.

291
00:31:13,468 --> 00:31:17,336
- Thanks a lot, Derek. I appreciate
it. Can you give us a moment?

292
00:31:19,921 --> 00:31:22,598
You don't know how good it is
to see you, my friend Chayton.

293
00:31:22,781 --> 00:31:23,781
-Likewise.

294
00:31:25,359 --> 00:31:26,359
You look good.

295
00:31:26,882 --> 00:31:28,326
-I'm a lot better than I feel.

296
00:31:28,648 --> 00:31:31,617
Uh... this is the gentleman I
was telling you about. Jaelen.

297
00:31:37,902 --> 00:31:38,902
-Welcome.

298
00:31:41,378 --> 00:31:43,511
-I'm gonna show him the footage.

299
00:31:49,789 --> 00:31:51,555
-Why don't we start with your name?

300
00:31:52,032 --> 00:31:53,032
-Jaelen.

301
00:31:54,219 --> 00:31:55,219
-Jaelen?

302
00:31:57,071 --> 00:31:59,158
So, Jaelen, who are you?

303
00:32:08,666 --> 00:32:11,399
- Our task was to monitor
human conditions.

304
00:32:11,729 --> 00:32:14,236
And to determine the
degree of infiltration.

305
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:16,047
-Infiltration by whom?

306
00:32:17,338 --> 00:32:19,075
-Alpha Draconians.

307
00:32:19,502 --> 00:32:20,502
-Draconians?

308
00:33:05,799 --> 00:33:06,799
Jaelen!

309
00:33:07,619 --> 00:33:10,284
Jaelen, what's happened?
Jaelen...

310
00:33:14,525 --> 00:33:15,992
-They took it, Robert.

311
00:33:17,963 --> 00:33:19,229
They took our baby.

312
00:33:20,092 --> 00:33:22,225
-Alright we gotta... we gotta go.

313
00:33:22,249 --> 00:33:24,256
- I'll take you to my house.
- That'd be perfect.

314
00:33:24,444 --> 00:33:25,577
-It's safer.

315
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:43,928
- Our army is coming here to
establish complete dominion.

316
00:33:44,628 --> 00:33:46,628
It has always been our intent

317
00:33:46,683 --> 00:33:48,750
to shield you from this threat.

318
00:33:49,293 --> 00:33:51,856
But we are entrenched in
war and we haven't the

319
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:54,083
means to bring the fleet
here to protect you.

320
00:33:55,475 --> 00:33:57,408
It is to be your darkest age.

321
00:35:18,875 --> 00:35:22,468
- Man, look at that. Look at
that. Look at that.

322
00:35:22,798 --> 00:35:23,798
That's amazing.

323
00:35:25,933 --> 00:35:26,933
-Open that one.

324
00:35:39,428 --> 00:35:40,624
-Wow.

325
00:36:27,554 --> 00:36:28,554
-Open that one.

326
00:36:32,894 --> 00:36:33,894
That's amazing.

327
00:36:45,927 --> 00:36:46,927
Wow.

328
00:38:04,162 --> 00:38:06,616
- We're gonna set the
world on fire with this.

329
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:08,281
-And I think soon.

330
00:38:35,763 --> 00:38:38,493
- There, I got it.
- Dude, we got a helicopter.

331
00:38:38,517 --> 00:38:39,781
Right behind there. See?

332
00:38:39,805 --> 00:38:41,805
-Oh shit, we gotta go.

333
00:38:51,491 --> 00:38:52,491
-Wow!

334
00:38:52,632 --> 00:38:55,232
The mother lode.
- I think you're right.

335
00:39:18,441 --> 00:39:20,441
No, wait, wait, wait. Go back.

336
00:39:28,942 --> 00:39:29,942
Jaelen.

337
00:39:34,825 --> 00:39:35,825
Is this her?

338
00:39:37,161 --> 00:39:38,161
-It is.

339
00:39:38,708 --> 00:39:39,708
-Who is she?

340
00:39:39,918 --> 00:39:43,030
- A young woman Jaelen had the
good taste to fall in love with.

341
00:39:43,925 --> 00:39:45,708
- You do have a good
taste, my friend.

342
00:39:45,733 --> 00:39:47,824
-She's being held at the Dulce Base.

343
00:39:47,887 --> 00:39:50,732
I'm quite sure her friends and family
would be interested to know that.

344
00:39:50,879 --> 00:39:53,413
- How soon would you
be able to upload?

345
00:39:53,450 --> 00:39:54,450
-Right now.

346
00:39:55,965 --> 00:39:57,627
-Where are the files going into?

347
00:39:57,651 --> 00:39:59,651
-To an old compadre of mine.

348
00:39:59,675 --> 00:40:03,039
- They'll upload to sixty [ indistinct]
globally. The initial launch

349
00:40:03,063 --> 00:40:05,063
should reach about 6 million people.

350
00:40:05,512 --> 00:40:06,788
What's ETA?

351
00:40:08,772 --> 00:40:10,305
-Just under four hours.

352
00:40:11,077 --> 00:40:13,810

And Robert,

359
00:40:57,623 --> 00:40:59,023
you can go with them.

360
00:41:00,694 --> 00:41:04,181

people that I can't leave behind.

00:41:04,567 --> 00:41:06,101
Not with what's coming.

362
00:41:07,278 --> 00:41:10,078
- Where will you go?
- Into the wolf's den.

363
00:41:10,934 --> 00:41:12,934
To be near the woman he loves.

364
00:41:13,583 --> 00:41:14,583
The Dulce base.

How will you get there?

367
00:41:25,037 --> 00:41:26,104
I will take you.

00:41:44,034 --> 00:41:46,193

Draconians and other races

have been manipulating human perception

In your way of understanding,

395
00:44:21,098 --> 00:44:23,372

427
00:51:07,143 --> 00:51:09,810
no seasons. It's a
constant temperature.

428
00:51:11,175 --> 00:51:12,641
-Are there any oceans?

429
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:14,120
-There is one.

430
00:51:15,503 --> 00:51:19,236
Our water's of a different
consistency, different color,

431
00:51:20,148 --> 00:51:25,014
it contains all the nutrients that we
require. There is no need for food.

432

will live in a safe zone.

and all the illnesses.

-It's starting to sound like paradise.

439

-With you there, it will be.

-Get out of the vehicle now!

441
00:52:33,474 --> 00:52:35,790
Cross your legs, put
your hands on your head.

442
00:52:40,263 --> 00:52:42,022
Cross your legs!

443
00:52:44,996 --> 00:52:47,602
-Chayton! Chayton!

444
00:53:26,446 --> 00:53:27,446
Robert...

445
00:53:28,899 --> 00:53:30,499
Robert, can you hear me?

446
00:53:33,212 --> 00:53:34,679
Robert, are you there?

447
00:53:35,313 --> 00:53:36,313
-Jaelen.

448
00:53:38,392 --> 00:53:40,925
-I'm speaking to you with my thoughts.

449
00:53:41,201 --> 00:53:42,201
-Where are you?

450
00:53:43,654 --> 00:53:45,454
-They have me in captivity.

451
00:53:46,928 --> 00:53:47,928
And Robert...

452
00:53:49,162 --> 00:53:50,495
they killed Chayton.

453
00:53:51,717 --> 00:53:53,650
There was nothing I could do.

454
00:53:55,138 --> 00:53:56,472
I'm inside the base.

455
00:53:57,740 --> 00:53:59,273
I'm where I need to be.

456
00:54:47,659 --> 00:54:49,549
-Yeah. Yeah, it's me.

457
00:54:50,909 --> 00:54:53,109
Now, listen to me very carefully.

458
00:54:53,822 --> 00:54:57,289
In about 40 minutes you'll
have the files to upload.

459
00:54:57,518 --> 00:55:00,431
Text me when it's done, but
do not, I repeat,

460
00:55:00,455 --> 00:55:03,424
do not do anything until you hear from me.

461
00:55:03,922 --> 00:55:06,546
If you don't hear from me
by this time tomorrow,

462
00:55:06,844 --> 00:55:07,844
launch.

463
00:55:09,484 --> 00:55:10,484
Is that clear?

464
00:55:12,578 --> 00:55:13,578
Yeah.

465
00:56:38,264 --> 00:56:40,264
-I'll keep this brief, Jaelen.

466
00:56:41,154 --> 00:56:44,688
Knowing the impossibility
of rescuing your companion,

467
00:56:44,835 --> 00:56:48,108
I can only imagine that you came
here in the hopes to see her.

468
00:56:48,608 --> 00:56:49,608
To be with her.

469
00:56:50,975 --> 00:56:52,575
This was a misjudgment.

470
00:56:53,546 --> 00:56:55,479
We will not grant this union.

471
00:57:01,368 --> 00:57:02,932
As for yourself,

472
00:57:02,957 --> 00:57:05,712
like your five companions before
you, you will be dissected

473
00:57:06,173 --> 00:57:08,176
and studied by our scientists,

474
00:57:08,376 --> 00:57:12,524
in hopes that we might better
understand your telepathic abilities.

475
00:57:14,095 --> 00:57:15,495
You may be aware that

476
00:57:15,837 --> 00:57:20,355
one of our duties here is to see to the...
appetites of our hosts.

477
00:57:20,774 --> 00:57:23,826
Your companion will be
euthanized, and parts

478
00:57:23,851 --> 00:57:26,428
of her extracted,
for the delicacies.

479
00:57:27,501 --> 00:57:29,568
As for the son you've fathered,

480
00:57:29,696 --> 00:57:31,363
he'll be taken to Capella,

481
00:57:31,774 --> 00:57:32,774
where in manhood

482
00:57:33,251 --> 00:57:35,401
he will serve as a Draconian agent.

483
00:57:37,204 --> 00:57:39,204
He and ten will father hybrids

484
00:57:39,581 --> 00:57:42,171
who will also serve in this capacity.

485
00:57:42,573 --> 00:57:44,006
So you see, you

486
00:57:44,643 --> 00:57:46,721
will be serving a
significant contribution to

487
00:57:46,745 --> 00:57:48,745
the Draconian cause.

488
00:57:49,034 --> 00:57:50,034
And for this

489
00:57:51,088 --> 00:57:52,227
we are grateful.

490
00:58:08,584 --> 00:58:11,960
-The Dulce Base is located
beneath the Archuleta Mesa

491
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:15,110
It's size is 4.6 miles in diameter.

492
00:58:15,569 --> 00:58:17,302
The base has seven levels.

493
00:58:17,326 --> 00:58:20,856
The last two of which are
designated for lab experimentation.

494
00:58:20,967 --> 00:58:25,426
These tests are carried out
by humans and Draconians.

495
00:58:25,450 --> 00:58:28,685
It's the sixth level where
Alyssa is being held.

496
00:58:29,447 --> 00:58:32,677
One of the secret entrances
is on the Mesa itself.

497
00:58:33,259 --> 00:58:36,305
The location was delivered
to us by one of our allies

498
00:58:36,330 --> 00:58:38,603
contained on the disk drive I gave you.

499
00:58:38,682 --> 00:58:41,784
-Can't you just get her to
walk in the back door?

500
00:58:42,917 --> 00:58:44,491
-Unless they find me first.

501
00:58:44,870 --> 00:58:47,670
-What makes you think
they won't kill you?

502
00:58:49,057 --> 00:58:51,391
-It's a chance I'm willing to take.

503
00:58:52,635 --> 00:58:54,902
-She must be a very
special woman.

504
00:58:58,237 --> 00:58:59,237
-Yes.

505
01:00:39,012 --> 01:00:40,658
I'm here, Alyssa.

506
01:00:41,348 --> 01:00:42,753
Where are you?

507
01:00:44,684 --> 01:00:46,284
Why don't you answer me?

508
01:02:01,796 --> 01:02:03,997
-Welcome, Mr. Casey.

509
01:02:05,476 --> 01:02:06,857
-Check him.

510
01:02:10,796 --> 01:02:12,730
-And who, may I ask, are you?

511
01:02:12,953 --> 01:02:14,223
-Marek

512
01:02:14,246 --> 01:02:15,847
Thai is Trea.

513
01:02:16,593 --> 01:02:18,761
-Let me guess: Draconians?

514
01:02:19,456 --> 01:02:20,456
-We are.

515
01:02:21,057 --> 01:02:24,391
-Well, then I'm certainly
not pleased to meet you.

516
01:02:24,877 --> 01:02:26,944
-It's clean where I found this.

517
01:02:29,168 --> 01:02:31,350
-Whatever your reason
is for coming here,

518
01:02:31,606 --> 01:02:32,606
understand

519
01:02:32,778 --> 01:02:36,444
we have no intention nor
interest in keeping you alive.

520
01:02:36,621 --> 01:02:39,073
-So I'm dead either way, right?
-Correct.

521
01:02:39,129 --> 01:02:41,636
No one will be spared.
-Why?

522
01:02:41,910 --> 01:02:44,684
-The Earth's position in
the solar system provides

523
01:02:44,709 --> 01:02:47,101
us with a strategic and
tactile advantage.

524
01:02:47,242 --> 01:02:51,198
-Robert, the human role in the
universe is inconsequential.

525
01:02:51,223 --> 01:02:53,850
-That may be so, but we
have a right to exist.

526
01:02:53,874 --> 01:02:57,276
-Only if we allow it.
-And we don't.

527
01:03:04,133 --> 01:03:06,914
-Well, before you start
waving your victory flag,

528
01:03:06,939 --> 01:03:11,544
might I suggest examining the contents
of the drive you hold in your hand?

529
01:03:12,789 --> 01:03:15,589
I think you'll find it very consequential.

530
01:03:21,270 --> 01:03:22,270
-Alright.

531
01:03:22,833 --> 01:03:23,833
Take him.

532
01:03:36,081 --> 01:03:37,081
And Robert,

533
01:03:39,909 --> 01:03:42,747
Jaelen had something
we very much want.

534
01:03:43,226 --> 01:03:45,959
It's a Grey stone that
contains crystals.

535
01:03:46,312 --> 01:03:48,112
-What? You mean the Parean?

536
01:03:48,249 --> 01:03:51,550
-Yes. You wouldn't know
where it is, would you?

537
01:03:51,574 --> 01:03:54,479
-Sure. it's right here.

538
01:04:08,657 --> 01:04:11,119
-Alright, 300 self-retraining
tractor, please.

539
01:04:11,516 --> 01:04:13,249
-Preparing  Euthanization.

540
01:04:17,836 --> 01:04:19,506
-It's time, Jaelen.

541
01:04:35,072 --> 01:04:36,072
-Good.

542
01:04:37,361 --> 01:04:38,361
So...

543
01:04:38,973 --> 01:04:41,879
-So, it would seem that your
drive contains sensitive

544
01:04:41,903 --> 01:04:44,175
information that some of
you find distressing.

545
01:04:44,447 --> 01:04:46,114
However, all it can serve

546
01:04:46,137 --> 01:04:49,009
is to tell people what they'll
find out anyway in four days.

547
01:04:49,376 --> 01:04:50,577
-I mean, yes...

548
01:04:50,775 --> 01:04:52,908
but you're forgetting one thing.

549
01:04:53,398 --> 01:04:57,109
The locations of all your hidden
bases and their secret entrances.

550
01:04:57,133 --> 01:04:59,391
What do you think? I just waltzed in here?

551
01:04:59,742 --> 01:05:04,061
I want you to think of tens of thousands
of me storming your underground

552
01:05:04,086 --> 01:05:09,208
castles with automatic weapons. You'll have
one hell of a shit storm to contend with.

553
01:05:09,232 --> 01:05:12,249
And don't think for one
moment it won't happen.

554
01:05:12,742 --> 01:05:15,075
Vengeance and survival at all costs

555
01:05:15,820 --> 01:05:18,973
are two very profound
impulses we humans have.

556
01:05:20,296 --> 01:05:21,296
-I see.

557
01:05:21,968 --> 01:05:25,983
So am I then, to understand that this
information has not yet been released?

558
01:05:26,210 --> 01:05:27,210
-No, it hasn't.

559
01:05:28,085 --> 01:05:31,971
But if I don't make a phone call,
it will go viral to a few million people.

560
01:05:32,218 --> 01:05:36,018
By sun down, your phones will be ringing
off the hook and in a few days,

561
01:05:36,562 --> 01:05:39,429
you'll be running from
a shower of bullets.

562
01:05:39,835 --> 01:05:43,182
Now, I also have the power to
keep it from going out at all.

563
01:05:43,406 --> 01:05:47,838
And then you cowards can hide down
here in your underground fortress

564
01:05:47,862 --> 01:05:49,862
without any worries.

565
01:05:51,453 --> 01:05:53,386
-And why should we trust you?

566
01:05:54,773 --> 01:05:56,611
-Because I'm not so

567
01:05:56,953 --> 01:05:59,953
eager to hand out doomsday
news to the world.

568
01:06:00,770 --> 01:06:04,103
These last few days of life
are all we have left.

569
01:06:04,520 --> 01:06:05,520
Why spoil it?

570
01:06:06,208 --> 01:06:07,208
-Indeed.

571
01:06:08,801 --> 01:06:09,801
Alright.

572
01:06:10,603 --> 01:06:12,881
What are you terms in
exchange for this?

573
01:06:43,888 --> 01:06:45,766
An arrangement's been made.

574
01:08:08,174 --> 01:08:09,174
-No...

575
01:08:09,377 --> 01:08:11,044
When I know they're safe.

576
01:10:39,167 --> 01:10:40,167
-Yes.

577
01:10:44,441 --> 01:10:45,441
It's done.

578
01:10:49,728 --> 01:10:50,728
-You're safe now.

579
01:10:51,923 --> 01:10:52,989
We are grateful.

580
01:11:08,875 --> 01:11:09,875
-Yeah, it's me.

581
01:11:11,625 --> 01:11:12,625
Launch.

582
01:11:15,398 --> 01:11:17,931
-You have betrayed
your promise to me!

583
01:11:17,955 --> 01:11:22,826
-On behalf of the 7.1 billion humans on
this planet earth that you have condemned,

584
01:11:22,850 --> 01:11:24,234
Fuck you!

585
01:11:52,793 --> 01:11:55,460
-The day that was
mankind's darkest came

586
01:11:55,988 --> 01:11:57,521
and the invasion began.

587
01:11:58,389 --> 01:11:59,389
At first,

588
01:11:59,569 --> 01:12:01,569
the take over was not so easy.

589
01:12:02,428 --> 01:12:05,161
The resistance from
humans was formidable,

590
01:12:05,350 --> 01:12:07,699
but in time, futile.

591
01:12:08,882 --> 01:12:12,482
Most of the underground bases
were stormed, many died,

592
01:12:14,046 --> 01:12:16,940
Within weeks, the genocide had begun.

593
01:12:20,116 --> 01:12:23,049
By the time our fleet
returned months later,

594
01:12:23,158 --> 01:12:25,908
nearly one half of all humans
had been exterminated.

595
01:12:27,526 --> 01:12:29,992
In a battle that raged for many days,

596
01:12:30,249 --> 01:12:34,110
our fleet managed to rescue
nearly three million humans.

597
01:12:34,437 --> 01:12:36,570
It was our only return to earth.

598
01:12:37,098 --> 01:12:41,152
By now, it is certain that the remaining
human population is long gone.

599
01:12:41,801 --> 01:12:42,934
The ones rescued

600
01:12:43,793 --> 01:12:46,326
represent all that is left of mankind.

601
01:13:06,078 --> 01:13:10,264
The Arcturus constellation is a planet
very much like Earth and non-inhabited.

602
01:13:10,562 --> 01:13:12,333
Known as Boötes,

603
01:13:12,357 --> 01:13:15,351
it is here where humans have
already begun their renaissance.

604
01:13:16,179 --> 01:13:18,846
Free of war, instability, and oppression.

605
01:13:19,312 --> 01:13:21,295
the rebirth has been prosperous.

606
01:13:23,849 --> 01:13:26,848
As the Science Officer of
the Andromedan Council,

607
01:13:26,959 --> 01:13:31,614
I often frequent with Alyssa at my side
to monitor human development.

608
01:13:32,293 --> 01:13:36,904
And I am often reminded of the final
passage of one of Robert's short stories.

609
01:13:38,269 --> 01:13:41,473
For the inhabitants of this
planet once known as earth,

610
01:13:41,497 --> 01:13:46,169
it would be a new beginning,
a new age for mankind.

611
01:13:46,988 --> 01:13:48,321
Humanity would live...

612
01:13:49,988 --> 01:13:50,988
once again.

613
01:13:51,012 --> 01:13:53,012
The end
