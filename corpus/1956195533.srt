2
00:00:31,827 --> 00:00:33,162
Is he dancing?

3
00:00:37,299 --> 00:00:39,435
I do the twist,
that's so '60s.

4
00:00:43,939 --> 00:00:45,338
There you go.

5
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:46,809
That's what we all do.

6
00:00:50,211 --> 00:00:52,181
Hello, everyone.

7
00:00:58,786 --> 00:01:00,019
Hello.

8
00:01:00,021 --> 00:01:02,055
I would like
to make a toast.

9
00:01:02,057 --> 00:01:03,689
Where is the man
of the night?

10
00:01:03,691 --> 00:01:05,859
- Get out, Richard Blumstein.
- Get up there.

11
00:01:05,861 --> 00:01:07,460
There he is.

12
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:11,298
Now, I've known Richie
a long, long time.

13
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:13,600
As a matter of fact,
I remember when

14
00:01:13,602 --> 00:01:16,035
we used to skip gym
class and smoke pot

15
00:01:16,037 --> 00:01:17,904
- behind the bleachers.
- Not.

16
00:01:17,906 --> 00:01:20,106
And now he's a judge.

17
00:01:20,108 --> 00:01:22,174
Well, Bob, considering
all the tomfoolery

18
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:23,543
you talked me
into those days,

19
00:01:23,545 --> 00:01:25,846
it's no wonder what a
clown you turned out to be.

20
00:01:27,248 --> 00:01:29,216
- Let's make a long story short.
- Too late.

21
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:31,685
Richard's one
of my best friends,

22
00:01:31,687 --> 00:01:34,087
and I'm honored to be able
to raise my glass with you

23
00:01:34,089 --> 00:01:36,522
on your 45th birthday.

24
00:01:36,524 --> 00:01:39,558
Now, even though
another year has passed,

25
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,962
he doesn't seem any
older than the last.

26
00:01:41,964 --> 00:01:43,197
Or any younger.

27
00:01:43,199 --> 00:01:45,766
Hey, let's arrest that
obviously drunken man.

28
00:01:45,768 --> 00:01:47,334
To Richie.

29
00:01:47,336 --> 00:01:49,438
- To Richie.
- Thank you, Bob.

30
00:01:49,837 --> 00:01:51,206
Everyone.

31
00:01:53,809 --> 00:01:54,841
Oh, Lord.

32
00:01:54,843 --> 00:01:57,110
I'm not used to seeing
these two like that.

33
00:01:57,112 --> 00:01:59,279
They're usually so uptight.

34
00:01:59,281 --> 00:02:01,747
Sweetheart, when you've
worked with these guys

35
00:02:01,749 --> 00:02:02,848
as long as I have,

36
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,687
you learn they only
care about two things.

37
00:02:05,254 --> 00:02:07,054
Law and liquor.

38
00:02:10,458 --> 00:02:11,959
Can I ask you a question?

39
00:02:11,961 --> 00:02:13,759
Don't be shy, honey.

40
00:02:13,761 --> 00:02:15,931
Do you think I'm wasting
my time here?

41
00:02:16,631 --> 00:02:17,798
What do you mean?

42
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,567
Well, since the divorce,
I have my daughter,

43
00:02:20,569 --> 00:02:22,405
and her future
to think about, and...

44
00:02:23,338 --> 00:02:25,472
There's an opening
in paralegal.

45
00:02:25,474 --> 00:02:27,174
Thinking about taking it.

46
00:02:27,176 --> 00:02:29,543
Yeah, just talk to Bob
about it tonight.

47
00:02:29,545 --> 00:02:31,010
Yeah?

48
00:02:31,012 --> 00:02:32,480
What would I say?

49
00:02:34,016 --> 00:02:35,384
Be yourself.

50
00:02:37,586 --> 00:02:39,355
What's the worst
that could happen?

51
00:02:57,373 --> 00:02:59,739
Hey Mr. Simmons,
do you have a minute?

52
00:02:59,741 --> 00:03:02,943
For you Ms. Lindberg,
I've got several.

53
00:03:02,945 --> 00:03:05,211
Well, I wanted to talk
to you about

54
00:03:05,213 --> 00:03:07,614
that paralegal position
that just opened up.

55
00:03:07,616 --> 00:03:08,615
Oh, really.

56
00:03:08,617 --> 00:03:10,584
- Yeah.
- You don't say.

57
00:03:10,586 --> 00:03:13,621
I was wondering
if you could...

58
00:03:13,623 --> 00:03:16,492
If I'd be willing to put
in a good word for you?

59
00:03:16,892 --> 00:03:18,594
Yeah. Yeah.

60
00:03:23,265 --> 00:03:25,868
You know, I could
get you the interview.

61
00:03:26,836 --> 00:03:28,568
And I'm sure that
my recommendation

62
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:30,971
can get you that position.

63
00:03:30,973 --> 00:03:33,773
But, what kind of position

64
00:03:33,775 --> 00:03:35,977
would you be willing
to give me?

65
00:03:43,851 --> 00:03:45,884
Mr. Jenkins, I, uh, I...

66
00:03:45,886 --> 00:03:47,789
Come on, Sally.
We're all adults here.

67
00:03:49,023 --> 00:03:51,626
I'm sure we can
come to some

68
00:03:53,328 --> 00:03:54,693
agreement.

69
00:03:54,695 --> 00:03:58,730
I, uh, I don't know if, uh...

70
00:03:58,732 --> 00:03:59,868
Shh.

71
00:04:01,802 --> 00:04:04,437
Why don't meet upstairs
in about 15 minutes

72
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:06,841
and we'll talk about it?

73
00:04:10,679 --> 00:04:11,780
Okay?

74
00:04:25,393 --> 00:04:27,927
Listen, Jimmy, don't
let this thing get you up.

75
00:04:27,929 --> 00:04:29,295
These things happen.

76
00:04:29,297 --> 00:04:30,629
Happen?

77
00:04:30,631 --> 00:04:31,865
That guy got away
with murder.

78
00:04:31,867 --> 00:04:34,367
Innocent until proven guilty,
and he wasn't.

79
00:04:34,369 --> 00:04:35,935
How can you say that?
I don't understand.

80
00:04:35,937 --> 00:04:37,771
Are you gonna let this
eat you up all night?

81
00:04:37,773 --> 00:04:38,908
We have a job to do.

82
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:46,348
Is this
the right place?

83
00:04:46,848 --> 00:04:49,148
Yeah, 139 River.

84
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:51,518
Doesn't look like
anyone's been home all day.

85
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,386
Anonymous calls have
a way of

86
00:04:53,388 --> 00:04:55,122
not being too reliable.

87
00:04:55,124 --> 00:04:56,423
Wait, so we came
all the way out here

88
00:04:56,425 --> 00:04:58,290
to appease some
nervous old cat lady?

89
00:04:59,494 --> 00:05:00,996
- Shit.
- Did that come from inside?

90
00:05:02,364 --> 00:05:04,133
Go around back,
I'll call for backup.

91
00:06:02,424 --> 00:06:03,793
Cobb.

92
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,761
Cobb, come in.

93
00:06:06,996 --> 00:06:08,362
Cobb.

94
00:06:08,364 --> 00:06:10,230
It's a goddamn
massacre back here.

95
00:06:10,232 --> 00:06:11,600
Where the hell are you?

96
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,836
Goddammit, Cobb.

97
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:16,205
Fuck.

98
00:07:23,905 --> 00:07:25,105
Help me.

99
00:07:25,107 --> 00:07:26,740
Ma'am,
I'm a police officer.

100
00:07:26,742 --> 00:07:28,076
I'm here to help.

101
00:07:29,578 --> 00:07:31,679
Is the person who did this
to you still in the house?

102
00:08:12,187 --> 00:08:13,655
What happened in there?

103
00:08:15,189 --> 00:08:16,291
They're all dead.

104
00:08:17,593 --> 00:08:18,994
He killed them all.

105
00:11:19,308 --> 00:11:20,375
Hello.

106
00:11:27,348 --> 00:11:28,382
Hello.

107
00:14:15,216 --> 00:14:16,551
So what do we have here?

108
00:14:17,551 --> 00:14:18,583
15-year-old female.

109
00:14:18,585 --> 00:14:20,621
Body was dumped here
sometime late last night.

110
00:14:22,723 --> 00:14:24,990
- Jealous boyfriend?
- Doubtful.

111
00:14:24,992 --> 00:14:26,328
Her heart was
ripped clean out.

112
00:14:27,361 --> 00:14:28,463
Oh, God.

113
00:14:28,896 --> 00:14:30,163
Shit.

114
00:14:30,165 --> 00:14:32,134
Yeah, someone sure
did a number on her.

115
00:14:33,233 --> 00:14:34,703
You can say that again.

116
00:14:38,939 --> 00:14:40,409
Hang on a second.

117
00:14:49,416 --> 00:14:50,683
Did you see this?

118
00:14:50,685 --> 00:14:52,153
No, I didn't.

119
00:14:52,886 --> 00:14:54,289
Who is that?

120
00:14:59,493 --> 00:15:01,727
Hey. Look what I found.

121
00:15:01,729 --> 00:15:03,064
Thank you, officer.

122
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:06,032
- Who's that?
- I don't know.

123
00:15:06,034 --> 00:15:09,634
I found it under the body,
thought maybe you'd recognize her.

124
00:15:09,636 --> 00:15:12,504
I'll take it down to evidence
when we get to the station.

125
00:15:12,506 --> 00:15:14,873
The mother's
already down there.

126
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:16,875
She ID'd the body earlier.

127
00:15:16,877 --> 00:15:18,711
I say we start by
interviewing her friends.

128
00:15:18,713 --> 00:15:20,615
I hear they hang out at
the video store down town.

129
00:15:21,782 --> 00:15:23,016
You think they'll
be able to help?

130
00:15:24,049 --> 00:15:24,453
We gotta start somewhere.

131
00:15:54,415 --> 00:15:57,517
I'm not a police officer,
I'm a detective.

132
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:59,251
There's no reason
to be afraid.

133
00:15:59,253 --> 00:16:00,818
I'm Detective Cobb,

134
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:02,221
and this is Detective Fincher.

135
00:16:02,223 --> 00:16:03,956
Look, man, we're not
doing anything wrong.

136
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:06,893
Did you kids know
a Suzette Sinclair?

137
00:16:06,895 --> 00:16:08,827
Seen her around
from time to time.

138
00:16:08,829 --> 00:16:11,264
Does she
hang out here often?

139
00:16:11,266 --> 00:16:13,633
Kinda, she doesn't
have many friends.

140
00:16:13,635 --> 00:16:14,701
What about you?

141
00:16:14,703 --> 00:16:17,302
Are you guys friends?
Have you seen her lately?

142
00:16:17,304 --> 00:16:19,141
No, I wouldn't say
we were friends.

143
00:16:20,007 --> 00:16:21,673
So, you didn't like her?

144
00:16:21,675 --> 00:16:23,009
No, nothing like that.

145
00:16:23,011 --> 00:16:24,509
Just, we had
chemistry together.

146
00:16:24,511 --> 00:16:26,879
So what about a boyfriend?
Did she have a boyfriend?

147
00:16:26,881 --> 00:16:28,081
I really don't know.

148
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:29,581
Anything that you could
think of would help us.

149
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:32,051
- Enemies, bullies, maybe an ex-boyfriend.
- What's this about?

150
00:16:32,053 --> 00:16:34,453
- We said we don't know her, man.
- Well, obviously somebody knew her.

151
00:16:34,455 --> 00:16:36,455
We found her dead
this morning.

152
00:16:36,457 --> 00:16:39,057
Somebody killed her and dumped
her body by the McNeil Cabin.

153
00:16:39,059 --> 00:16:40,826
Well, we had nothing
to do with that.

154
00:16:40,828 --> 00:16:42,695
- No one said you did.
- Why don't you stay out of it?

155
00:16:42,697 --> 00:16:44,763
It's none of your fucking
business, you little harlot.

156
00:16:44,765 --> 00:16:46,065
Oh, get lost, loser.

157
00:16:46,067 --> 00:16:47,700
She doesn't wanna
see you anymore.

158
00:16:47,702 --> 00:16:49,033
Is this true, Danielle, huh?

159
00:16:49,035 --> 00:16:51,770
- What kind of lies has she been telling you about me?
- Hey!

160
00:16:51,772 --> 00:16:52,771
Is there a problem here?

161
00:16:52,773 --> 00:16:54,673
Why don't you just keep
out of this, old man?

162
00:16:54,675 --> 00:16:56,874
It doesn't concern you.
Get back to your Studebaker.

163
00:16:56,876 --> 00:16:59,311
Why don't you let the girls
alone and be on your way, huh?

164
00:16:59,313 --> 00:17:01,914
Who the fuck do
you think you are?

165
00:17:01,916 --> 00:17:03,915
That's who the fuck
I think I am.

166
00:17:03,917 --> 00:17:05,520
Now, leave the girls alone,
hot shot.

167
00:17:07,055 --> 00:17:08,519
Fine.

168
00:17:08,521 --> 00:17:10,722
But we'll finish
this later, Danielle.

169
00:17:10,724 --> 00:17:12,258
You can count on that.

170
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:14,527
And as for you.

171
00:17:14,529 --> 00:17:17,299
Here's what I think
of your fuckin' badge, pig.

172
00:17:20,434 --> 00:17:21,837
Thank you, officer.

173
00:17:22,537 --> 00:17:23,605
Detective.

174
00:17:25,873 --> 00:17:27,309
Fuckin' asshole!

175
00:17:30,345 --> 00:17:31,813
That's your boyfriend?

176
00:17:32,547 --> 00:17:33,945
Ex-boyfriend.

177
00:17:33,947 --> 00:17:35,280
Doesn't know
when to quit.

178
00:17:35,282 --> 00:17:37,482
Well, if he tries
anything like that again,

179
00:17:37,484 --> 00:17:39,151
here's my card,
give me a call.

180
00:17:39,153 --> 00:17:41,086
- Okay.
- Okay.

181
00:17:42,322 --> 00:17:43,788
Do you mind if I ask
you girls something?

182
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:45,923
I'm investigating the
murder of Suzette Sinclair.

183
00:17:48,562 --> 00:17:50,162
Did you know her?

184
00:17:50,164 --> 00:17:52,198
Not really.
Well, sort of.

185
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,232
We just went to junior
high school together.

186
00:17:54,234 --> 00:17:55,837
When was the last time
you spoke to her?

187
00:17:56,803 --> 00:17:58,136
About a month ago.

188
00:17:58,138 --> 00:18:00,105
I saw her walking away
down the hall.

189
00:18:00,107 --> 00:18:01,675
She was going
to math class.

190
00:18:02,577 --> 00:18:04,512
Did she have any enemies
that you know of?

191
00:18:05,213 --> 00:18:06,645
We really wouldn't know.

192
00:18:06,647 --> 00:18:10,749
Like she said, we hadn't hung
out with her in a long time.

193
00:18:10,751 --> 00:18:13,451
Well, I'll tell you what. If you
think of anything that could help me,

194
00:18:13,453 --> 00:18:15,589
I'd really appreciate it.
My number's on the card.

195
00:18:16,723 --> 00:18:18,193
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

196
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:26,432
- You get anything?
- No.

197
00:18:26,434 --> 00:18:28,500
This girl doesn't
have any friends.

198
00:18:28,502 --> 00:18:30,403
It doesn't look like anybody
would be throwing a party

199
00:18:30,405 --> 00:18:31,740
knowing that
she's dead though.

200
00:18:35,175 --> 00:18:36,708
- Oh, shit.
- What?

201
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:38,544
I was supposed to
meet Jenny for lunch.

202
00:18:39,746 --> 00:18:40,746
Good luck with that one.

203
00:18:40,748 --> 00:18:42,347
All right, let's get back
to the station.

204
00:18:42,349 --> 00:18:43,584
Maybe I can still make it.

205
00:18:53,161 --> 00:18:54,660
Jenny.

206
00:18:54,662 --> 00:18:56,061
Jenny, wait.

207
00:18:56,063 --> 00:18:57,596
Just, I can explain.

208
00:18:57,598 --> 00:18:58,730
Explain what?

209
00:18:58,732 --> 00:19:00,665
That you forgot that I
was waiting for you again?

210
00:19:00,667 --> 00:19:02,366
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I'm working on a case.

211
00:19:02,368 --> 00:19:04,303
Yeah, you are
always working.

212
00:19:04,305 --> 00:19:06,171
All I asked was one hour
of your time

213
00:19:06,173 --> 00:19:08,574
so you could help plan your
little girl's birthday party.

214
00:19:08,576 --> 00:19:10,576
Jen, I don't need
the criticism.

215
00:19:10,578 --> 00:19:12,211
I've always been
there for my daughter.

216
00:19:12,213 --> 00:19:13,512
Oh, really?

217
00:19:13,514 --> 00:19:15,346
Well when was the last
time you made it down

218
00:19:15,348 --> 00:19:16,615
to one of her soccer games?

219
00:19:16,617 --> 00:19:18,384
I know, I'm sorry,
I'm doing the best I can.

220
00:19:18,386 --> 00:19:19,984
But it's hard,
I have a job to do.

221
00:19:19,986 --> 00:19:21,753
And you think that I don't?

222
00:19:21,755 --> 00:19:23,888
I work just like you
and I still manage

223
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:25,191
to find time for her.

224
00:19:25,193 --> 00:19:26,593
All right, regardless
of what you may think,

225
00:19:26,595 --> 00:19:29,095
she is just as important
to me as she is to you.

226
00:19:29,097 --> 00:19:30,261
I am still her father.

227
00:19:30,263 --> 00:19:33,298
I waited here for
over an hour, James.

228
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:36,367
You know what, forget it. I will
take care of all the plans myself.

229
00:19:36,369 --> 00:19:38,136
All you need
to do is show up.

230
00:19:38,138 --> 00:19:39,440
Can you handle that?

231
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,039
Yes, yes.

232
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:42,775
- Of course.
- Good.

233
00:19:42,777 --> 00:19:44,609
And you better be there.

234
00:19:44,611 --> 00:19:46,644
The only thing in the world
that that little girl wants

235
00:19:46,646 --> 00:19:49,882
is for her father to be
at her birthday party.

236
00:19:49,884 --> 00:19:52,384
You know what, you can
disappoint me all you want.

237
00:19:52,386 --> 00:19:54,952
I've already made up my mind
what a deadbeat you are.

238
00:19:54,954 --> 00:19:56,255
But I will not stand by

239
00:19:56,257 --> 00:19:58,426
and watch you continue
to break her heart.

240
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,560
I'm sorry.

241
00:20:01,562 --> 00:20:02,930
I promise I'll be there.

242
00:20:06,232 --> 00:20:07,599
You know, when
I married a cop,

243
00:20:07,601 --> 00:20:09,602
I thought that I would
have somebody in my life

244
00:20:09,604 --> 00:20:11,703
that would always be there.

245
00:20:11,705 --> 00:20:14,507
Somebody that would always
be there to protect me

246
00:20:14,509 --> 00:20:16,444
and the family that
we created together.

247
00:20:17,678 --> 00:20:20,915
But you would have to actually
be there to protect us.

248
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:23,682
Jenny.

249
00:20:23,684 --> 00:20:26,655
Jim, if you are not there,
do not bother coming back.

250
00:20:44,204 --> 00:20:45,506
Hello.

251
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,107
Oh, hi, Mrs. Collingwood.

252
00:20:49,109 --> 00:20:51,144
Yes, she's fine.
She's asleep.

253
00:20:51,146 --> 00:20:52,547
We watched...

254
00:20:52,812 --> 00:20:53,848
No.

255
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:57,851
Vicky's dad is
the new landlord.

256
00:20:58,986 --> 00:21:00,088
I know.

257
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:04,758
Uh, what?

258
00:21:06,493 --> 00:21:07,692
No, yeah, yeah, yeah.

259
00:21:07,694 --> 00:21:09,364
She went to sleep
right afterwards.

260
00:21:10,864 --> 00:21:12,431
No, no.

261
00:21:12,433 --> 00:21:14,299
You guys take your time.

262
00:21:14,301 --> 00:21:16,769
No, I have homework
to do anyway.

263
00:21:16,771 --> 00:21:17,771
You guys have fun.

264
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:19,872
Okay.

265
00:21:19,874 --> 00:21:21,606
I'll see you guys
in a few hours.

266
00:21:21,608 --> 00:21:23,345
Bye, Mrs. Collingwood.

267
00:21:33,287 --> 00:21:34,686
Ryan.

268
00:21:34,688 --> 00:21:36,388
- Sorry.
- I told you to be quiet.

269
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:38,492
Sorry, do you think
they heard?

270
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:41,096
No, I don't think so.

271
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:43,665
Good.

272
00:21:45,299 --> 00:21:46,999
So what do you wanna do?

273
00:21:47,001 --> 00:21:48,136
Yeah.

274
00:21:48,935 --> 00:21:50,536
I don't know.

275
00:21:50,538 --> 00:21:52,006
What do you wanna do?

276
00:21:54,541 --> 00:21:55,708
I don't know.

277
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:57,241
I thought we were
gonna watch a movie.

278
00:21:57,243 --> 00:21:58,644
Yeah, yeah.

279
00:21:58,646 --> 00:21:59,981
Let's watch a movie.

280
00:22:01,448 --> 00:22:03,015
And maybe we could um,

281
00:22:03,017 --> 00:22:04,150
I don't know,

282
00:22:04,152 --> 00:22:06,318
fool around
on the couch a little.

283
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,988
But what if Christine
wakes up?

284
00:22:09,491 --> 00:22:10,791
I'll be quiet.

285
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,366
<i>We offer
a last resort for our clients.</i>

286
00:22:21,368 --> 00:22:24,036
<i>For most, we are
the final place to turn.</i>

287
00:22:24,038 --> 00:22:25,406
<i>So call us now...</i>

288
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:29,207
<i>1-800-MDK4YOU.</i>

289
00:22:29,209 --> 00:22:32,443
<i>That's 1-800-MDK4YOU.</i>

290
00:22:32,445 --> 00:22:34,782
<i>Call us now
and fight back today.</i>

291
00:23:04,645 --> 00:23:06,311
<i>We interrupt this broadcast
to bring you</i>

292
00:23:06,313 --> 00:23:07,712
<i>late breaking news.</i>

293
00:23:07,714 --> 00:23:09,981
<i>Tragedy struck our small
town earlier today.</i>

294
00:23:09,983 --> 00:23:12,183
<i>Authorities have stated
they're investigating the death</i>

295
00:23:12,185 --> 00:23:14,452
<i>of young Suzette Sinclair.</i>

296
00:23:21,127 --> 00:23:22,463
Hold on.

297
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:27,833
- Hello.
- Are you watching this?

298
00:23:27,835 --> 00:23:29,401
<i>No, I'm doing my nails.</i>

299
00:23:29,403 --> 00:23:31,369
- Put on the news.
- Why?

300
00:23:31,371 --> 00:23:32,706
<i>Just do it.</i>

301
00:23:36,109 --> 00:23:37,809
<i>Sinclair was the daughter
of Robert Jenkins,</i>

302
00:23:37,811 --> 00:23:39,045
<i>a local district attorney</i>

303
00:23:39,047 --> 00:23:40,813
<i>who was killed
nearly ten years ago</i>

304
00:23:40,815 --> 00:23:45,217
<i>along with 23 others in the
Havenwood fire at Blumsfield Manor.</i>

305
00:23:45,219 --> 00:23:47,419
Oh, wow, that is so cool.

306
00:23:48,655 --> 00:23:50,222
She's dead, Carla.

307
00:23:50,224 --> 00:23:52,423
Cool is not the word
I would use.

308
00:23:52,425 --> 00:23:54,392
She's on the news though.

309
00:23:54,394 --> 00:23:56,261
That's pretty bitchin'.

310
00:23:56,263 --> 00:23:57,764
Do you think
they'll catch him?

311
00:23:58,298 --> 00:23:59,534
Who knows?

312
00:24:00,635 --> 00:24:02,300
<i>This break sucks.</i>

313
00:24:02,302 --> 00:24:03,669
- Carla?
- <i>What?</i>

314
00:24:03,671 --> 00:24:05,538
<i>Are you even hearing this?</i>

315
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:07,742
What would you like me
to do about it?

316
00:24:08,309 --> 00:24:09,541
I don't know.

317
00:24:09,543 --> 00:24:11,644
Oh, my God,
chill out, Danielle.

318
00:24:11,646 --> 00:24:13,679
You act like this guy
is after you or something.

319
00:24:13,681 --> 00:24:15,646
Don't say that.

320
00:24:15,648 --> 00:24:17,819
I don't even wanna
talk about it anymore.

321
00:24:19,787 --> 00:24:21,752
Well, you called me
to talk about it.

322
00:24:21,754 --> 00:24:23,257
I know, it's just...

323
00:24:24,357 --> 00:24:25,856
I guess I'll see you tomorrow.

324
00:24:25,858 --> 00:24:28,128
Oh, don't be
like that, Danielle.

325
00:24:29,797 --> 00:24:31,663
<i>Hey, I know what you need.</i>

326
00:24:31,665 --> 00:24:32,798
You need a party.

327
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,300
- A what?
- A party.

328
00:24:35,302 --> 00:24:37,569
Didn't you say your parents
were gone away this weekend?

329
00:24:37,571 --> 00:24:39,270
- No. Carla.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

330
00:24:39,272 --> 00:24:40,640
<i>Yes, yes yes yes.</i>

331
00:24:40,642 --> 00:24:42,540
- <i>We'll have a party on Friday night.</i>
- No way.

332
00:24:42,542 --> 00:24:43,942
I'll invite some
of the girls.

333
00:24:43,944 --> 00:24:45,676
I'll have Glen get us beer,

334
00:24:45,678 --> 00:24:48,012
<i>we'll get pizza
delivered, rent movies,</i>

335
00:24:48,014 --> 00:24:49,080
it'll be awesome.

336
00:24:49,082 --> 00:24:51,616
- <i>No, no no.</i>
- Yes, yes, yes, yes.

337
00:24:51,618 --> 00:24:54,019
- I'm calling Jessica right now. Bye.
- No.

338
00:24:54,021 --> 00:24:55,322
- Carla.
- Hmm.

339
00:24:56,924 --> 00:24:57,959
Ugh.

340
00:25:01,962 --> 00:25:03,598
<i>Are you happy now?</i>

341
00:25:04,698 --> 00:25:06,066
Are you happy?

342
00:25:47,007 --> 00:25:48,209
Brian.

343
00:25:53,981 --> 00:25:55,349
Brian.

344
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,842
Brian.

345
00:26:26,914 --> 00:26:28,182
Brian.

346
00:26:46,666 --> 00:26:48,101
Brian.

347
00:28:47,555 --> 00:28:48,920
Where the hell
have you been?

348
00:28:48,922 --> 00:28:50,191
Oh, sorry,
I slept late.

349
00:28:51,023 --> 00:28:52,390
Well, fix your goddamn tie,

350
00:28:52,392 --> 00:28:54,058
clean yourself up
a bit for Christ's sake.

351
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:56,294
You look like dog shit.

352
00:28:56,296 --> 00:28:57,465
So, what did I miss?

353
00:28:58,165 --> 00:28:59,498
Double murder.

354
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:00,731
Teenagers.

355
00:29:00,733 --> 00:29:02,203
The girl, Mari Lindberg,

356
00:29:03,169 --> 00:29:05,804
and the boyfriend,
Brian Tennant.

357
00:29:05,806 --> 00:29:07,208
Where are the parents?

358
00:29:08,107 --> 00:29:09,307
We haven't been
able to locate

359
00:29:09,309 --> 00:29:11,108
any of the boy's family
as of yet.

360
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:13,144
The girl's mother
died a few years ago,

361
00:29:13,146 --> 00:29:14,949
and the father is
away on business.

362
00:29:17,117 --> 00:29:18,485
Who found the body?

363
00:29:21,454 --> 00:29:23,454
She was babysitting
the neighbor's daughter.

364
00:29:23,456 --> 00:29:26,092
They say they came home
a little bit early.

365
00:29:26,659 --> 00:29:27,926
She was already gone.

366
00:29:27,928 --> 00:29:29,260
Obviously upset.

367
00:29:29,262 --> 00:29:32,765
They tried calling her,
and got no response.

368
00:29:32,767 --> 00:29:35,701
Having a spare key,
they let themselves in,

369
00:29:35,703 --> 00:29:37,238
and they found her.

370
00:29:40,307 --> 00:29:42,207
So what happened?
She left the kid alone

371
00:29:42,209 --> 00:29:45,210
to have a fling
with the boyfriend?

372
00:29:45,212 --> 00:29:47,045
We found blood
on the rear window

373
00:29:47,047 --> 00:29:48,614
of the neighbor's house.

374
00:29:48,616 --> 00:29:50,682
So you're saying he abducted
her at the neighbor's house

375
00:29:50,684 --> 00:29:52,218
and brought her here?

376
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:53,254
Seems like it.

377
00:29:55,321 --> 00:29:56,689
What about
the boyfriend here?

378
00:29:56,691 --> 00:29:59,026
Well, we found him dumped
in the backyard in the shed.

379
00:29:59,792 --> 00:30:01,326
Apparently, he only wanted her.

380
00:30:01,328 --> 00:30:03,295
The boyfriend was just
in the wrong place

381
00:30:03,297 --> 00:30:04,828
at the wrong time.

382
00:30:05,999 --> 00:30:07,934
What
makes you say that?

383
00:30:12,873 --> 00:30:14,242
Oh.

384
00:30:15,643 --> 00:30:16,911
Jesus.

385
00:30:24,751 --> 00:30:26,718
How long has
she been like this?

386
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,122
About 36 hours.

387
00:30:30,691 --> 00:30:31,923
Nearly two days?

388
00:30:31,925 --> 00:30:34,026
Are you sure?

389
00:30:34,028 --> 00:30:36,661
Well, based on the congealment
of all her blood,

390
00:30:36,663 --> 00:30:39,032
I'm guessing the time
of death to be about 10 PM.

391
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,599
Just like the last one.

392
00:30:42,601 --> 00:30:43,937
What does this guy want?

393
00:30:45,472 --> 00:30:47,974
I think he's sending
a message, Detective.

394
00:30:49,577 --> 00:30:51,276
A message?

395
00:30:51,278 --> 00:30:53,981
You don't think he'd go through
all this for fun, do you?

396
00:30:55,248 --> 00:30:57,449
You know what,
do me a favor.

397
00:30:57,451 --> 00:30:58,884
You take care of the body.

398
00:30:58,886 --> 00:31:00,453
We'll do the thinking
around here, okay?

399
00:31:09,629 --> 00:31:10,894
See this?
Look, look.

400
00:31:10,896 --> 00:31:12,397
Is this one
of the Sinclair girl?

401
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:13,464
Uh-huh, same photo.

402
00:31:13,466 --> 00:31:14,833
What are you
still doin' with that?

403
00:31:14,835 --> 00:31:17,301
I forgot to submit it
to evidence.

404
00:31:17,303 --> 00:31:18,737
Listen, you can't
be walking around

405
00:31:18,739 --> 00:31:19,971
with evidence
in your pocket.

406
00:31:19,973 --> 00:31:21,373
Look, I didn't do it
on purpose, all right?

407
00:31:21,375 --> 00:31:24,008
Excuses, excuses,
and more excuses.

408
00:31:24,010 --> 00:31:25,378
And I know you're
still drinking.

409
00:31:26,547 --> 00:31:28,278
I am not
still drinking.

410
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:30,483
Don't bullshit me.
I can smell it on you.

411
00:31:31,318 --> 00:31:33,685
You know what?
Do me a favor.

412
00:31:33,687 --> 00:31:34,853
Get out of here.

413
00:31:34,855 --> 00:31:35,987
Just go home.

414
00:31:35,989 --> 00:31:37,655
Go home?

415
00:31:37,657 --> 00:31:40,293
If you don't like it,
take it up with the Captain.

416
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:09,107
- Fincher.
- <i>Detective,</i>

417
00:34:09,109 --> 00:34:12,109
<i>meet me at the overlook by
the park tomorrow at five p.m.</i>

418
00:34:12,111 --> 00:34:13,580
<i>I have something for you.</i>

419
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,448
<i>Don't be late.</i>

420
00:34:16,917 --> 00:34:18,319
Who is this?

421
00:34:19,586 --> 00:34:21,252
Hello?

422
00:34:21,254 --> 00:34:22,823
Who is this? Hello?

423
00:34:32,966 --> 00:34:34,966
<i>And I do have
some stuff here.</i>

424
00:34:34,968 --> 00:34:36,837
<i>And I wanted to let you know...</i>

425
00:34:38,104 --> 00:34:39,470
<i>Some of the stuff...</i>

426
00:34:39,472 --> 00:34:40,937
<i>I'm a little worried, yeah.</i>

427
00:34:40,939 --> 00:34:42,540
<i>It's not gonna look good.</i>

428
00:34:42,542 --> 00:34:44,545
<i>'Cause we can see from these
surveillance photos here.</i>

429
00:34:44,977 --> 00:34:46,076
<i>God.</i>

430
00:34:46,078 --> 00:34:47,377
<i>What?</i>

431
00:34:47,379 --> 00:34:48,946
<i>We saw this young lady...</i>

432
00:34:48,948 --> 00:34:51,385
So, why are we getting
a movie again?

433
00:34:51,952 --> 00:34:53,850
Why not?

434
00:34:53,852 --> 00:34:55,356
I don't know. It's just...

435
00:34:56,856 --> 00:34:58,955
Are we really gonna watch it?

436
00:34:58,957 --> 00:35:00,959
So, fine then,
you just want us

437
00:35:00,961 --> 00:35:02,894
to sit around
in silence all night?

438
00:35:02,896 --> 00:35:04,428
You know what I mean.

439
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:05,865
You never end up
watching it anyway.

440
00:35:09,169 --> 00:35:10,538
- Fine.
- Thank you.

441
00:35:14,073 --> 00:35:15,441
Watch out, asshole.

442
00:35:16,176 --> 00:35:17,575
Slut.

443
00:35:17,577 --> 00:35:18,712
Excuse you.

444
00:35:20,314 --> 00:35:22,513
Oh, bitchin'!

445
00:35:22,515 --> 00:35:24,883
I know a drinking game
to go with this one.

446
00:35:24,885 --> 00:35:26,183
A drinking game?

447
00:35:26,185 --> 00:35:27,484
Sweetie, you will soon learn

448
00:35:27,486 --> 00:35:30,087
that there is a drinking game
to go with anything.

449
00:35:30,089 --> 00:35:31,758
What the hell?

450
00:35:32,057 --> 00:35:33,825
Shit!

451
00:35:33,827 --> 00:35:37,127
You really scared me back
into the '70s, old man.

452
00:35:37,129 --> 00:35:38,696
Come on, Carla,
let's just go.

453
00:35:38,698 --> 00:35:40,397
I scared you?

454
00:35:40,399 --> 00:35:42,869
There are a lot
scarier things in here.

455
00:35:44,104 --> 00:35:45,939
Yeah, well, right now
all I see is you.

456
00:35:47,039 --> 00:35:49,140
Seems like a lot
of young girls

457
00:35:49,142 --> 00:35:50,677
are going missing lately.

458
00:35:51,778 --> 00:35:53,680
What the hell are
you talking about?

459
00:35:55,515 --> 00:35:56,915
Couldn't help but overhear,

460
00:35:56,917 --> 00:36:00,551
you ladies are worried
of the killer.

461
00:36:00,553 --> 00:36:02,756
You're not gonna
scare me, old man.

462
00:36:05,124 --> 00:36:06,526
Such a shame.

463
00:36:07,426 --> 00:36:09,296
Such pretty girls.

464
00:36:10,964 --> 00:36:12,666
Flesh is fresher,

465
00:36:13,365 --> 00:36:15,568
the blood more potent.

466
00:36:17,236 --> 00:36:18,836
He takes them.

467
00:36:18,838 --> 00:36:22,640
- Takes them young.
- Take your hands off of us, you creepazoid.

468
00:36:22,642 --> 00:36:24,744
Just watch
yourselves, girls.

469
00:36:25,678 --> 00:36:27,245
He's back.

470
00:36:27,247 --> 00:36:29,747
- No one's safe.
- Screw you, nut job.

471
00:36:29,749 --> 00:36:31,116
Come on, Danielle.

472
00:36:32,452 --> 00:36:34,287
What the hell is
going on over here?

473
00:36:35,088 --> 00:36:36,721
Find you.

474
00:36:36,723 --> 00:36:38,622
Find you all.

475
00:36:38,624 --> 00:36:40,957
- He'll find you all!
- What are you doing?

476
00:36:40,959 --> 00:36:42,394
Let's go already.

477
00:36:42,396 --> 00:36:44,194
No one is safe!

478
00:37:41,988 --> 00:37:44,325
Didn't figure you
for a quitter, Detective.

479
00:37:46,993 --> 00:37:48,028
You?

480
00:37:48,896 --> 00:37:50,363
What the hell do you want?

481
00:37:54,734 --> 00:37:56,370
Told you I have
something for you.

482
00:37:57,203 --> 00:37:58,535
Well, let me have it then.

483
00:37:58,537 --> 00:38:00,006
My information
is expensive.

484
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:03,341
Is this the kind of
conversation you wanna have?

485
00:38:03,343 --> 00:38:06,142
That's fine, I'll just take it up with
your supervisor at the coroner's office.

486
00:38:06,144 --> 00:38:07,879
Okay, okay, fine.
You win.

487
00:38:07,881 --> 00:38:10,348
Give me one reason I should
even be standing here.

488
00:38:10,350 --> 00:38:12,353
You need this information.

489
00:38:13,019 --> 00:38:14,584
These murders are connected.

490
00:38:14,586 --> 00:38:17,023
And the ripper is to blame.

491
00:38:17,923 --> 00:38:19,290
Ripper?

492
00:38:19,292 --> 00:38:21,095
What the hell are
you talking about?

493
00:38:21,894 --> 00:38:23,194
Don't waste my time.

494
00:38:23,196 --> 00:38:25,029
I'm not wasting
anyone's time.

495
00:38:25,031 --> 00:38:26,464
Explain yourself then.

496
00:38:26,466 --> 00:38:27,734
Here, take a look.

497
00:38:42,149 --> 00:38:44,281
How the hell did you even
find out about all of this?

498
00:38:44,283 --> 00:38:45,982
Look at me, Detective.

499
00:38:45,984 --> 00:38:47,651
Do I look like a child?

500
00:38:47,653 --> 00:38:49,854
I remember what
happened that night.

501
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:52,256
And now what? Are
you gonna extort me?

502
00:38:52,258 --> 00:38:54,091
This isn't blackmail.

503
00:38:54,093 --> 00:38:56,227
- I'm just trying to...
- People of this town

504
00:38:56,229 --> 00:38:58,029
don't know what
happened that night.

505
00:38:58,031 --> 00:39:00,397
And the people who do aren't
gonna start talking about it now.

506
00:39:00,399 --> 00:39:01,968
They don't even know
the Ripper existed.

507
00:39:13,513 --> 00:39:15,412
- Look familiar? That's...
- Yeah, I know who that is.

508
00:39:15,414 --> 00:39:17,549
That's Gerald Vatetta.

509
00:39:17,551 --> 00:39:19,484
He was accused of
molesting his daughter,

510
00:39:19,486 --> 00:39:20,953
but they couldn't
get a conviction.

511
00:39:22,155 --> 00:39:24,089
And she died
in a car accident

512
00:39:24,091 --> 00:39:25,189
a few months later.

513
00:39:25,191 --> 00:39:27,591
That was no accident,
Detective, and you know it.

514
00:39:27,593 --> 00:39:28,826
He blamed everyone,

515
00:39:28,828 --> 00:39:31,296
and he killed them
all in return.

516
00:39:31,298 --> 00:39:34,832
- You mean...
- The ripper wasn't some lunatic on a murder spree.

517
00:39:34,834 --> 00:39:37,104
Gerald Vatetta was
out for revenge.

518
00:39:42,508 --> 00:39:43,975
How do I know
I can trust you?

519
00:39:43,977 --> 00:39:46,111
- How much choice do you have?
- Listen, man, I don't know...

520
00:39:46,113 --> 00:39:47,345
No, you listen to me, man.

521
00:39:47,347 --> 00:39:49,948
Ripper nearly destroyed your
career before it even started.

522
00:39:49,950 --> 00:39:51,915
You were so obsessed with
him you didn't see your life

523
00:39:51,917 --> 00:39:53,317
falling apart right
in front of you.

524
00:39:53,319 --> 00:39:56,053
Your wife left you, your daughter
barely knows who you are,

525
00:39:56,055 --> 00:39:57,787
and if it wasn't for
that partner of yours,

526
00:39:57,789 --> 00:40:00,325
you'd be working some
school crosswalk right now.

527
00:40:00,327 --> 00:40:01,859
You need this information.

528
00:40:01,861 --> 00:40:03,995
Yeah, well how am I supposed
to say I found it?

529
00:40:03,997 --> 00:40:06,033
You're a detective,
do your job.

530
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:10,203
This man is still out there,
and he's gonna kill again.

531
00:40:10,836 --> 00:40:12,203
But why?

532
00:40:12,205 --> 00:40:13,537
Why disappear for ten years

533
00:40:13,539 --> 00:40:15,673
before suddenly
reappearing again?

534
00:40:15,675 --> 00:40:17,010
I haven't figured
that out yet.

535
00:40:18,611 --> 00:40:20,678
You have access
to files that I don't.

536
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:21,979
Sealed documents.

537
00:40:21,981 --> 00:40:23,848
Oh, you just expect me
to waltz into the file room

538
00:40:23,850 --> 00:40:25,716
- at the police station and go rifling through...
- No,

539
00:40:25,718 --> 00:40:28,218
I don't expect anything
from you, Detective.

540
00:40:29,722 --> 00:40:31,721
You do what you
want with this.

541
00:40:31,723 --> 00:40:33,089
You're on
to something here.

542
00:40:33,091 --> 00:40:34,627
I'm just trying to help.

543
00:40:43,269 --> 00:40:44,570
Detective.

544
00:40:46,638 --> 00:40:48,372
If you're gonna
catch this guy,

545
00:40:48,374 --> 00:40:50,243
you're gonna have to start
thinking like a killer.

546
00:41:19,606 --> 00:41:21,874
What the hell
is this bullshit.

547
00:41:23,209 --> 00:41:24,278
Hey.

548
00:41:24,943 --> 00:41:26,278
What?

549
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,814
What the fuck?

550
00:41:31,885 --> 00:41:33,220
Stop.

551
00:42:00,814 --> 00:42:01,912
Hey.

552
00:42:01,914 --> 00:42:04,684
- What are you doing here?
- I wanted to apologize.

553
00:42:05,651 --> 00:42:06,917
Apologize?

554
00:42:06,919 --> 00:42:08,886
- It's 4:30 in the morning.
- Yeah, yeah yeah.

555
00:42:08,888 --> 00:42:11,455
I just wanted to come by
and say I'm sorry.

556
00:42:11,457 --> 00:42:13,591
- Are you drunk?
- No.

557
00:42:13,593 --> 00:42:15,225
No, I'm not drunk.

558
00:42:15,227 --> 00:42:18,763
- Jesus, Jim, have you even slept yet?
- No.

559
00:42:18,765 --> 00:42:20,665
I mean, I was up all night,
I was thinking about it.

560
00:42:20,667 --> 00:42:23,533
- Listen, can I just come in...
- No, I don't think that's such a good idea.

561
00:42:23,535 --> 00:42:26,002
Well, why not? I wanted
to see my little girl.

562
00:42:26,004 --> 00:42:27,971
Oh, you're little girl
needs a father,

563
00:42:27,973 --> 00:42:30,508
not a stranger who's gonna
come and go as he pleases.

564
00:42:30,510 --> 00:42:31,642
Right, look,

565
00:42:31,644 --> 00:42:33,410
I was on my way,
I got her the present.

566
00:42:33,412 --> 00:42:37,448
- I did, and I was... lost tracked of time.
- No, just save your breath.

567
00:42:37,450 --> 00:42:38,716
Just save your breath.

568
00:42:38,718 --> 00:42:40,821
I'm tired of your
bullshit excuses.

569
00:42:42,053 --> 00:42:43,620
I meant what I said
to you the other day.

570
00:42:43,622 --> 00:42:45,890
I want you out
of my life for good.

571
00:42:45,892 --> 00:42:48,158
I don't wanna hear anymore
of your empty promises

572
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:49,394
and your selfish lies.

573
00:42:49,396 --> 00:42:51,261
I want you to turn
around and leave.

574
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:53,397
- No, I can't.
- No, you are not gonna hurt her anymore.

575
00:42:53,399 --> 00:42:55,232
Now, look, she's
still my daughter.

576
00:42:55,234 --> 00:42:57,502
You understand me? You can
not get rid of me that easy.

577
00:42:57,504 --> 00:42:59,770
Oh, well, I can
sure as hell try.

578
00:42:59,772 --> 00:43:01,071
You know,
she's young enough now

579
00:43:01,073 --> 00:43:02,673
that maybe in time she'll
forget all about you

580
00:43:02,675 --> 00:43:04,075
and what you did to her.

581
00:43:04,077 --> 00:43:06,310
Even if her father is a
waste, she won't remember.

582
00:43:06,312 --> 00:43:08,113
A waste?

583
00:43:08,115 --> 00:43:09,415
Goodbye, Jim.

584
00:43:10,283 --> 00:43:11,482
Goodbye.

585
00:44:11,176 --> 00:44:12,709
Take it easy, man.

586
00:44:12,711 --> 00:44:14,447
I don't want any
problems, all right?

587
00:44:19,318 --> 00:44:20,853
Whoa.

588
00:44:52,017 --> 00:44:53,850
And just what the hell
were you thinking?

589
00:44:53,852 --> 00:44:56,386
I told you, I fell
and it went off.

590
00:44:56,388 --> 00:44:57,555
You fell and it went off.

591
00:44:57,557 --> 00:44:59,259
And monkeys might
fly out of my ass.

592
00:45:00,126 --> 00:45:01,691
What do you have
to say about this?

593
00:45:01,693 --> 00:45:04,396
And don't give me any of that
"Oh, he's my partner," horse shit.

594
00:45:05,564 --> 00:45:07,330
If you knew he was
off the wagon,

595
00:45:07,332 --> 00:45:09,267
and you didn't
report that to me,

596
00:45:09,269 --> 00:45:12,236
you are as responsible for
this incident as he is.

597
00:45:12,238 --> 00:45:15,038
I can not have my detectives
on the biggest case

598
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:16,439
this town has ever seen,

599
00:45:16,441 --> 00:45:20,877
running around drunk, shooting
at innocent civilians.

600
00:45:20,879 --> 00:45:23,013
I didn't know he had
reached that point.

601
00:45:23,015 --> 00:45:25,318
Well, clearly he has.

602
00:45:28,988 --> 00:45:31,221
You need to surrender
your badge and your gun.

603
00:45:31,223 --> 00:45:32,723
You're suspended indefinitely.

604
00:45:32,725 --> 00:45:34,725
Effective immediately.

605
00:45:34,727 --> 00:45:36,660
No, no, you can't.

606
00:45:36,662 --> 00:45:38,897
- I got a lead on this case.
- Oh, what?

607
00:45:38,899 --> 00:45:40,798
Your meeting with your
little friend in the park?

608
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:43,100
Yeah, I've already spoken
to his supervisor.

609
00:45:43,102 --> 00:45:44,736
We're gonna be bringing
him up on charges

610
00:45:44,738 --> 00:45:46,205
for stolen evidence.

611
00:45:49,876 --> 00:45:51,841
I've had enough of this crap.

612
00:45:51,843 --> 00:45:53,977
You're off this case, I'm
assigning it to somebody else.

613
00:45:53,979 --> 00:45:57,415
Wait a minute. I've been working on
this for a week, you can't just...

614
00:45:57,417 --> 00:45:59,216
Shut your mouth.

615
00:45:59,218 --> 00:46:01,752
He's lucky I don't
throw him in a cell

616
00:46:01,754 --> 00:46:03,587
with his little ginger friend.

617
00:46:03,589 --> 00:46:05,890
And you're lucky you're not on
suspension for insubordination.

618
00:46:05,892 --> 00:46:07,160
- What?
- Enough.

619
00:46:09,162 --> 00:46:13,033
Your badge, your gun, now.

620
00:46:19,405 --> 00:46:20,473
Fine.

621
00:46:33,885 --> 00:46:35,386
Now get the hell out
of my precinct

622
00:46:35,388 --> 00:46:36,623
before I do lock you up.

623
00:46:46,499 --> 00:46:49,299
Captain, if you just give me
a little bit more time,

624
00:46:49,301 --> 00:46:51,303
- I can get him in shape.
- No, no.

625
00:46:52,004 --> 00:46:53,669
You did things your way,

626
00:46:53,671 --> 00:46:55,839
now we're doing them my way.

627
00:46:55,841 --> 00:46:57,477
And I don't care how long
I had known you.

628
00:46:58,310 --> 00:47:00,144
You watch yourself
around here.

629
00:47:00,146 --> 00:47:01,548
You're on very thin ice.

630
00:47:27,939 --> 00:47:29,909
Yeah, yeah I did.

631
00:47:31,343 --> 00:47:32,544
Oh, my God, yes.

632
00:47:34,245 --> 00:47:35,779
Oh, my God,
I'll be right there.

633
00:47:37,050 --> 00:47:39,252
Oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God.

634
00:47:53,533 --> 00:47:55,232
Mom, I'm taking a shower.

635
00:47:55,234 --> 00:47:57,368
Okay, let me know
before you leave.

636
00:47:57,370 --> 00:47:58,705
Yes, mother.

637
00:49:34,667 --> 00:49:35,769
Kristin?

638
00:49:58,992 --> 00:50:00,359
Honey, are you okay?

639
00:50:09,535 --> 00:50:10,703
No!

640
00:50:11,004 --> 00:50:12,372
No!

641
00:50:15,774 --> 00:50:17,109
No!

642
00:50:28,653 --> 00:50:30,087
Okay, guys, now listen.

643
00:50:30,089 --> 00:50:31,988
My parents will be
back in two days,

644
00:50:31,990 --> 00:50:33,390
and if this house
is a mess,

645
00:50:33,392 --> 00:50:35,325
they're gonna kill me.

646
00:50:35,327 --> 00:50:37,394
Danielle, please, lighten up.

647
00:50:37,396 --> 00:50:38,865
Yeah, Danielle,
don't be such a spaz.

648
00:50:39,832 --> 00:50:41,430
Don't worry about her.

649
00:50:41,432 --> 00:50:43,100
We're gonna have
a good time tonight,

650
00:50:43,102 --> 00:50:44,502
and I'm gonna make sure of it.

651
00:50:44,504 --> 00:50:46,839
Even if it's the last thing
I do.

652
00:50:49,207 --> 00:50:50,908
You're gonna take this beer,

653
00:50:50,910 --> 00:50:52,274
you're gonna drink it,

654
00:50:52,276 --> 00:50:54,745
- and you're gonna like it.
- Come on, Carla.

655
00:50:54,747 --> 00:50:55,979
You know I don't.

656
00:50:55,981 --> 00:50:57,583
And you're gonna like it.

657
00:50:59,352 --> 00:51:01,484
What could go wrong?

658
00:51:01,486 --> 00:51:03,388
- Let's go.
- I'm comin', bitch.

659
00:51:22,975 --> 00:51:24,344
Fuck.

660
00:51:27,412 --> 00:51:28,845
What the hell are
you doin' in here?

661
00:51:28,847 --> 00:51:29,915
Research.

662
00:51:30,515 --> 00:51:31,649
In the dark?

663
00:51:31,651 --> 00:51:33,817
Don't you remember
you've been suspended?

664
00:51:33,819 --> 00:51:35,151
Take a look at this.

665
00:51:35,153 --> 00:51:36,520
Look at that.

666
00:51:36,522 --> 00:51:38,020
Remember the photo we found?

667
00:51:38,022 --> 00:51:39,221
That's Katie Vatetta.

668
00:51:39,223 --> 00:51:40,723
Gerald Vatetta's daughter.

669
00:51:40,725 --> 00:51:43,296
She was sent to the orphanage
after he was arrested.

670
00:51:44,397 --> 00:51:46,395
What does that have to do
with you being here tonight?

671
00:51:46,397 --> 00:51:47,765
Think of this, think, Walt.

672
00:51:47,767 --> 00:51:49,836
Ten years ago we witnessed
that massacre.

673
00:51:50,769 --> 00:51:51,968
Really?

674
00:51:51,970 --> 00:51:54,437
You really think this has
something to do with that?

675
00:51:54,439 --> 00:51:56,707
Listen, just hear me out.

676
00:51:56,709 --> 00:51:58,975
Gerald Vatetta killed all
those people that night

677
00:51:58,977 --> 00:52:00,310
because he blamed them

678
00:52:00,312 --> 00:52:01,845
for his daughter's death.

679
00:52:01,847 --> 00:52:03,312
Gerard Vatetta is the Ripper.

680
00:52:03,314 --> 00:52:05,883
- That's not possible.
- It isn't?

681
00:52:05,885 --> 00:52:07,084
So you think it's
a coincidence

682
00:52:07,086 --> 00:52:08,451
that the Ripper got away

683
00:52:08,453 --> 00:52:11,154
and no one's heard from
Vatetta since his trial?

684
00:52:11,156 --> 00:52:13,290
Look, we worked hard
to keep that unknown,

685
00:52:13,292 --> 00:52:14,790
and now you're gonna
spend all your time

686
00:52:14,792 --> 00:52:16,160
digging it up again?

687
00:52:16,162 --> 00:52:18,162
We can not put a lid on
this this time, Walter.

688
00:52:18,164 --> 00:52:20,196
Look, three murders
in the past week.

689
00:52:20,198 --> 00:52:21,964
Every crime scene
with this photo.

690
00:52:21,966 --> 00:52:24,067
If you think that's a coincidence,
you're out of your mind.

691
00:52:24,069 --> 00:52:25,537
- Five.
- What?

692
00:52:26,004 --> 00:52:27,638
Five murders.

693
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:29,973
They found the bodies of
Kristin Thompson and her mother

694
00:52:29,975 --> 00:52:31,410
earlier tonight.

695
00:52:32,544 --> 00:52:33,780
Thompson.

696
00:52:34,446 --> 00:52:35,448
Photo?

697
00:52:36,414 --> 00:52:38,482
I've spent all my time
chasing after you.

698
00:52:38,484 --> 00:52:40,917
Trying to make sure you
don't do something stupid.

699
00:52:40,919 --> 00:52:42,086
Like you're doing now.

700
00:52:42,088 --> 00:52:43,620
Walter, we can not
just ignore the facts.

701
00:52:43,622 --> 00:52:45,788
The pictures, the dates,
the names,

702
00:52:45,790 --> 00:52:47,256
they're all the same.

703
00:52:47,258 --> 00:52:48,591
Tomorrow is the ten-year
anniversary

704
00:52:48,593 --> 00:52:51,127
of his daughter's death.
Look, look.

705
00:52:51,129 --> 00:52:53,633
Sinclair, Lindberg, Tennant,

706
00:52:54,332 --> 00:52:56,336
and now, Thompson.

707
00:52:57,769 --> 00:53:00,236
Don't you get it? These are
the children of all the people

708
00:53:00,238 --> 00:53:02,506
that he murdered
ten years ago?

709
00:53:02,508 --> 00:53:04,174
I'm telling you, man.
This guy got away

710
00:53:04,176 --> 00:53:05,944
and now he's back
to finish the job.

711
00:53:07,780 --> 00:53:10,379
We made a mistake
back then, Walter.

712
00:53:10,381 --> 00:53:11,684
Now we can fix it.

713
00:53:13,051 --> 00:53:14,519
It's not our case
anymore, James.

714
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:17,687
- Just let it go.
- All right, you know what?

715
00:53:17,689 --> 00:53:20,025
Forget it.
I'll handle it myself.

716
00:53:32,537 --> 00:53:34,604
You just don't get it,
do you?

717
00:53:34,606 --> 00:53:37,875
You run around town
like some sort of vigilante.

718
00:53:37,877 --> 00:53:39,408
Breaking into the station,

719
00:53:39,410 --> 00:53:41,046
stealing files at night,

720
00:53:42,013 --> 00:53:43,214
following up on leads

721
00:53:43,216 --> 00:53:45,482
built on tainted as
well as stolen evidence,

722
00:53:45,484 --> 00:53:47,486
going off to meet
God knows who,

723
00:53:48,153 --> 00:53:50,453
and you want support from me?

724
00:53:50,455 --> 00:53:52,291
What are you gonna do if
you catch the guy anyway?

725
00:53:53,059 --> 00:53:54,424
You know what's gonna happen?

726
00:53:54,426 --> 00:53:56,459
Someone else is
gonna get the credit

727
00:53:56,461 --> 00:53:57,863
and you're gonna get fired.

728
00:53:59,765 --> 00:54:02,466
Where were you
that night, anyway?

729
00:54:02,468 --> 00:54:04,468
What? What are you
talking about?

730
00:54:04,470 --> 00:54:06,372
Where the hell were you
ten years ago?

731
00:54:07,138 --> 00:54:08,538
Where did you run off to

732
00:54:08,540 --> 00:54:11,107
when you left me in
that house to be killed?

733
00:54:11,109 --> 00:54:13,377
Why do you want me to
forget about it so badly?

734
00:54:13,379 --> 00:54:15,044
How do I know you don't have
something to do with it?

735
00:54:15,046 --> 00:54:17,214
How do I know you're not
the one behind all of this?

736
00:54:17,216 --> 00:54:18,747
Watch yourself, James.

737
00:54:18,749 --> 00:54:20,786
You know I'm only
trying to protect you.

738
00:54:22,019 --> 00:54:23,720
I'm gonna find him, Walter.

739
00:54:23,722 --> 00:54:25,788
I'm gonna find him,
and I'm gonna stop him.

740
00:54:25,790 --> 00:54:26,857
Once and for all.

741
00:54:26,859 --> 00:54:28,728
Now, if you wanna
help me, then help me!

742
00:54:30,595 --> 00:54:32,097
You know I can't do that.

743
00:54:34,367 --> 00:54:35,868
Then you're part
of the problem.

744
00:54:37,135 --> 00:54:39,102
Fine.

745
00:54:39,104 --> 00:54:40,539
If that's the way
you want it.

746
00:54:43,107 --> 00:54:44,510
But you know what?

747
00:54:47,379 --> 00:54:48,714
I've warned you.

748
00:56:21,439 --> 00:56:23,140
- Hello.
- Jenny.

749
00:56:23,142 --> 00:56:24,741
Are you all right?
Is Amy okay?

750
00:56:24,743 --> 00:56:26,142
<i>James, what do you want?</i>

751
00:56:26,144 --> 00:56:27,276
Is Amy okay?

752
00:56:27,278 --> 00:56:29,879
Yeah, she's fine, she's
with my mother. Why?

753
00:56:29,881 --> 00:56:31,580
All right, look, I want
you to do me a favor.

754
00:56:31,582 --> 00:56:32,749
I want you to pack a bag

755
00:56:32,751 --> 00:56:34,383
and go and stay with
your mother for a while.

756
00:56:34,385 --> 00:56:35,752
My mother? Why?

757
00:56:35,754 --> 00:56:37,587
Jenny, I can't explain it.
Will you just trust me?

758
00:56:37,589 --> 00:56:38,988
Would you just do it please?

759
00:56:38,990 --> 00:56:40,890
<i>I don't have time for
this right now, James.</i>

760
00:56:40,892 --> 00:56:42,493
<i>There's someone at
the door now, so...</i>

761
00:56:42,495 --> 00:56:43,993
The door? Who is it?

762
00:56:43,995 --> 00:56:45,162
<i>It's just Walter.</i>

763
00:56:45,164 --> 00:56:47,497
Jenny, do not answer
the door, I am begging you.

764
00:56:47,499 --> 00:56:49,399
<i>Hi, Walter, James is
on the phone with me now.</i>

765
00:56:49,401 --> 00:56:51,567
- <i>Do you want to talk to him?</i>
- Jenny, do not let him in.

766
00:56:51,569 --> 00:56:53,037
Jenny, get out of
the house, right now.

767
00:56:53,039 --> 00:56:55,238
<i>James, call me back when
you come to your senses.</i>

768
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:56,839
Jenny, Jenny!

769
00:56:56,841 --> 00:56:57,943
Hello.

770
00:56:59,077 --> 00:57:00,178
Fuck!

771
00:57:49,495 --> 00:57:50,830
Jenny.

772
00:58:01,307 --> 00:58:02,742
What happened?

773
00:58:04,609 --> 00:58:05,977
You were right.

774
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:09,181
He's got Jenny.

775
00:58:10,982 --> 00:58:12,651
I tried to find him.

776
00:58:15,921 --> 00:58:17,823
But, I guess he got
the better of me.

777
00:58:18,356 --> 00:58:19,689
The Ripper?

778
00:58:19,691 --> 00:58:20,959
Where did he go?

779
00:58:22,662 --> 00:58:23,963
The orphanage.

780
00:58:26,932 --> 00:58:29,299
He has three more
sacrifices tonight.

781
00:58:29,301 --> 00:58:30,633
Sacrifices? For what?

782
00:58:30,635 --> 00:58:32,637
I don't know.

783
00:58:35,673 --> 00:58:36,939
I'm really sorry

784
00:58:36,941 --> 00:58:38,341
that I didn't believe you.

785
00:58:38,343 --> 00:58:39,875
It's okay.

786
00:58:39,877 --> 00:58:41,678
I'm gonna get you
an ambulance.

787
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:42,915
Hold still.

788
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:50,520
I ran away, James.

789
00:58:50,522 --> 00:58:52,955
<i>911, what is
your emergency?</i>

790
00:58:52,957 --> 00:58:54,225
That night.

791
00:58:55,260 --> 00:58:57,830
I got into the house,
I got through the door.

792
00:58:59,397 --> 00:59:00,832
But as I was walking around,

793
00:59:02,133 --> 00:59:04,837
I saw him bash Jenkins
in the back of the head.

794
00:59:06,939 --> 00:59:08,305
<i>Hello?</i>

795
00:59:08,307 --> 00:59:13,011
I was scared, but I had never
seen anything like that before.

796
00:59:23,354 --> 00:59:24,656
Here.

797
00:59:27,258 --> 00:59:28,860
Go get that son of a bitch.

798
01:00:01,459 --> 01:00:02,994
<i>Hello, 911.</i>

799
01:00:14,439 --> 01:00:16,406
Tell me about the sacrifices.

800
01:00:16,408 --> 01:00:17,607
What the hell
are you doing here?

801
01:00:17,609 --> 01:00:19,008
You talk to me.

802
01:00:19,010 --> 01:00:20,377
What the hell
is going on here?

803
01:00:20,379 --> 01:00:23,015
- What does he want?
- I've got nothing to say to you.

804
01:00:23,814 --> 01:00:25,415
Now you listen to me.

805
01:00:25,417 --> 01:00:27,350
This son of a bitch has
killed six innocent people.

806
01:00:27,352 --> 01:00:29,951
My partner is dead,
and now he has my wife.

807
01:00:29,953 --> 01:00:31,087
You're gonna start talking,

808
01:00:31,089 --> 01:00:32,357
and you're gonna talk fast.

809
01:00:32,925 --> 01:00:34,089
Okay.

810
01:00:34,091 --> 01:00:35,457
Okay, okay.

811
01:00:35,459 --> 01:00:36,695
Okay.

812
01:00:40,698 --> 01:00:42,399
Now you know something
you're not telling me.

813
01:00:42,401 --> 01:00:45,368
You gonna let it out, or am I
gonna beat it out of you?

814
01:00:45,370 --> 01:00:47,106
He needs seven sacrifices.

815
01:00:48,106 --> 01:00:49,171
I don't know.

816
01:00:49,173 --> 01:00:51,674
All right, all right,
okay, okay, okay.

817
01:00:51,676 --> 01:00:53,243
He's trying to bring
his daughter back.

818
01:00:53,245 --> 01:00:56,048
And then seven sacrifices
by tonight and the body.

819
01:00:56,481 --> 01:00:57,747
Body?

820
01:00:57,749 --> 01:00:59,285
To bring her soul back.

821
01:01:01,285 --> 01:01:02,419
Jenny.

822
01:01:02,421 --> 01:01:03,989
That's all I know, I swear.

823
01:01:04,388 --> 01:01:05,724
I swear.

824
01:01:07,191 --> 01:01:09,194
I need you to help me
get her back.

825
01:01:12,863 --> 01:01:14,830
You want me
to help you again?

826
01:01:14,832 --> 01:01:17,033
You're the only one who
knows the Ripper is back.

827
01:01:17,035 --> 01:01:18,901
I'm the one who got you this far.
Isn't that enough?

828
01:01:18,903 --> 01:01:20,506
Everybody thinks I'm crazy.

829
01:01:23,707 --> 01:01:25,077
What's in it for me?

830
01:01:31,984 --> 01:01:35,421
Please, I have no one else
to turn to.

831
01:02:07,553 --> 01:02:09,019
Oh, shit.

832
01:02:09,021 --> 01:02:10,789
Check those corners.

833
01:02:18,729 --> 01:02:20,596
Captain!

834
01:02:20,598 --> 01:02:22,001
Captain, get in here.

835
01:02:28,573 --> 01:02:29,875
He's dead.

836
01:02:30,642 --> 01:02:31,875
Search the building.

837
01:02:31,877 --> 01:02:33,846
I want every tenant
questioned.

838
01:02:35,948 --> 01:02:37,316
His gun is gone.

839
01:02:41,318 --> 01:02:43,486
Looks like our favorite
alcoholic was here.

840
01:02:43,488 --> 01:02:44,557
Fincher?

841
01:02:45,289 --> 01:02:47,089
Fernandez.

842
01:02:47,091 --> 01:02:49,294
I want an APB put out
on Detective Fincher.

843
01:02:50,227 --> 01:02:52,095
I want him in for questioning

844
01:02:52,097 --> 01:02:53,966
for the murder
of Detective Cobb.

845
01:03:01,906 --> 01:03:03,473
<i>I can not believe</i>

846
01:03:03,475 --> 01:03:04,510
<i>the power of...</i>

847
01:03:05,443 --> 01:03:06,978
<i>It is extraordinary.</i>

848
01:03:09,914 --> 01:03:11,515
<i>What are you doing?</i>

849
01:03:11,517 --> 01:03:12,647
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

850
01:03:12,649 --> 01:03:14,350
<i>Can't let you do that.</i>

851
01:03:14,352 --> 01:03:15,919
<i>What do you mean
you can not?</i>

852
01:03:15,921 --> 01:03:18,488
<i>Specimen 58 is
too valuable to be destroyed.</i>

853
01:03:18,490 --> 01:03:20,225
<i>I'll do anything to
make sure it lives.</i>

854
01:03:20,825 --> 01:03:22,026
What the hell is this?

855
01:03:22,593 --> 01:03:24,261
Serrano Reserve.

856
01:03:24,263 --> 01:03:26,098
121 proof rum.

857
01:03:27,499 --> 01:03:28,634
<i>What do you mean?</i>

858
01:03:30,901 --> 01:03:32,035
Oh, my God.

859
01:03:32,037 --> 01:03:33,539
It tastes like I'm
drinking gasoline.

860
01:03:35,506 --> 01:03:36,906
Give me that.

861
01:03:36,908 --> 01:03:38,644
Let me show you
how it's done.

862
01:03:40,745 --> 01:03:42,312
Chug, chug, chug...

863
01:03:42,314 --> 01:03:43,449
Yeah.

864
01:03:45,850 --> 01:03:47,517
Woo!

865
01:03:47,519 --> 01:03:49,021
That's how you drink it.

866
01:03:50,287 --> 01:03:52,087
<i>This is the
orphanage where his daughter</i>

867
01:03:52,089 --> 01:03:54,423
was captured before
the accident.

868
01:03:54,425 --> 01:03:56,392
It's been here all along.
I'm sure of it.

869
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:09,805
Wait.

870
01:04:09,807 --> 01:04:11,276
Are you sure this
is a good idea?

871
01:04:12,377 --> 01:04:13,942
It could be a trap.

872
01:04:13,944 --> 01:04:15,778
Yeah, I know it's a trap.

873
01:04:15,780 --> 01:04:17,249
Gotta save Jenny.

874
01:04:18,283 --> 01:04:20,049
Just go and look around
for another way in.

875
01:04:20,051 --> 01:04:21,687
He's not expecting
the both of us.

876
01:04:24,689 --> 01:04:27,122
Close these doors behind me.

877
01:04:27,124 --> 01:04:28,660
I don't want him
knowing we're here yet.

878
01:04:29,861 --> 01:04:31,597
What do I do
if I find her?

879
01:04:32,097 --> 01:04:33,464
Take her and run.

880
01:04:35,533 --> 01:04:36,669
What about you?

881
01:04:37,903 --> 01:04:40,238
I'm not leaving until
this bastard is dead.

882
01:05:54,345 --> 01:05:55,381
No.

883
01:05:57,649 --> 01:05:58,650
No.

884
01:07:00,979 --> 01:07:02,546
Oh, God.

885
01:07:04,348 --> 01:07:05,948
What did he do to you?

886
01:07:05,950 --> 01:07:07,183
You've got to get out
of here.

887
01:07:07,185 --> 01:07:08,450
I'm not leaving without you.

888
01:07:08,452 --> 01:07:09,852
Jim, he knows
that you're here.

889
01:07:09,854 --> 01:07:11,087
It's a trap.

890
01:07:11,089 --> 01:07:12,689
Goddammit, Jim,
just listen to me

891
01:07:12,691 --> 01:07:13,923
for once in your life.

892
01:07:13,925 --> 01:07:15,260
He's got a list of victims.

893
01:07:15,593 --> 01:07:16,825
What?

894
01:07:16,827 --> 01:07:18,296
Look over there on the wall.

895
01:07:49,160 --> 01:07:50,993
See, he's after you.

896
01:07:50,995 --> 01:07:52,330
You have to get out of here.

897
01:07:56,200 --> 01:07:58,169
I have to get you
out of here now.

898
01:08:07,712 --> 01:08:08,880
No!

899
01:08:47,619 --> 01:08:49,488
It's okay, it's okay.

900
01:09:23,988 --> 01:09:25,254
What happened?

901
01:09:25,256 --> 01:09:26,557
He got away.

902
01:09:27,859 --> 01:09:30,126
He found me outside.

903
01:09:30,128 --> 01:09:31,530
There's nothing you
could have done.

904
01:09:35,566 --> 01:09:37,336
This whole thing is a trap.

905
01:09:37,968 --> 01:09:39,335
It was all my fault.

906
01:09:39,337 --> 01:09:41,203
I should have never let
you come in by yourself.

907
01:09:41,205 --> 01:09:42,337
No, it isn't.

908
01:09:42,339 --> 01:09:43,574
It's mine.

909
01:09:45,309 --> 01:09:46,744
It should've been me.

910
01:09:49,646 --> 01:09:50,781
Oh, shit.

911
01:09:51,482 --> 01:09:52,516
What?

912
01:09:55,453 --> 01:09:57,152
We've got to find
this girl.

913
01:09:57,154 --> 01:09:58,386
Who is she?

914
01:09:58,388 --> 01:10:00,188
She's the last one.

915
01:10:00,190 --> 01:10:01,792
We've got to get
to her before he does.

916
01:10:03,895 --> 01:10:04,997
Me too?

917
01:10:06,030 --> 01:10:07,229
I want my daughter
growing up

918
01:10:07,231 --> 01:10:08,863
knowing that her mother
died protecting her

919
01:10:08,865 --> 01:10:09,765
from this monster.

920
01:10:09,767 --> 01:10:11,569
We've got
to fight him tonight.

921
01:10:12,770 --> 01:10:14,972
We'll find her,
we'll keep her safe.

922
01:10:15,940 --> 01:10:17,171
What about them?

923
01:10:17,173 --> 01:10:18,374
Well, they're
after me now.

924
01:10:18,376 --> 01:10:20,041
I'll come find you.

925
01:10:21,779 --> 01:10:23,381
I'll take care
of them, now go.

926
01:10:52,810 --> 01:10:53,979
Cheers.

927
01:10:57,781 --> 01:10:59,380
Woo!

928
01:10:59,382 --> 01:11:00,883
Woo, I'm drunk.

929
01:11:02,954 --> 01:11:04,219
Gimme that shot glass.

930
01:11:04,221 --> 01:11:06,221
Thank you, this one's
for Danielle.

931
01:11:06,223 --> 01:11:07,322
Come on, Carla.

932
01:11:07,324 --> 01:11:09,191
You know I don't.

933
01:11:09,193 --> 01:11:11,596
You don't drink,
you don't smoke.

934
01:11:12,297 --> 01:11:13,629
What do you do?

935
01:11:13,631 --> 01:11:15,566
Yeah, Danielle, we're
having this party for you.

936
01:11:16,167 --> 01:11:17,803
You gotta live a little.

937
01:11:18,403 --> 01:11:20,335
Live a little?

938
01:11:20,337 --> 01:11:22,673
Half of this stuff
will end up killing me.

939
01:11:24,007 --> 01:11:25,340
Prude.

940
01:11:27,979 --> 01:11:29,644
All right, no.

941
01:11:29,646 --> 01:11:30,981
Wait, that was my boob.

942
01:11:32,917 --> 01:11:34,586
That was personal.

943
01:11:36,922 --> 01:11:38,089
Shh.

944
01:11:39,790 --> 01:11:40,792
Shh.

945
01:11:41,793 --> 01:11:43,125
Do you hear that?

946
01:11:43,127 --> 01:11:44,129
Hear what?

947
01:11:44,962 --> 01:11:46,429
That sound.

948
01:11:48,432 --> 01:11:49,767
What was that?

949
01:11:50,668 --> 01:11:52,371
Someone should go
check that out.

950
01:11:54,404 --> 01:11:55,706
Not me.

951
01:11:56,440 --> 01:11:57,742
Whoa, not me.

952
01:11:59,811 --> 01:12:00,979
I'm not going.

953
01:12:02,379 --> 01:12:03,582
Not me.

954
01:12:07,217 --> 01:12:08,951
Fine, I'll check it out.

955
01:12:08,953 --> 01:12:10,455
I love you.

956
01:13:06,010 --> 01:13:08,077
Ow, what the fuck?

957
01:13:08,079 --> 01:13:10,078
What the hell is your problem?

958
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:12,148
What the hell's my problem?

959
01:13:12,150 --> 01:13:15,317
Oh, great, it's the bod squad.

960
01:13:15,319 --> 01:13:18,153
Aw, did I scare
the little girlies?

961
01:13:18,155 --> 01:13:20,156
Get bent, lame wood.

962
01:13:20,158 --> 01:13:21,493
I need a cigarette.

963
01:13:22,427 --> 01:13:23,992
I need a drink.

964
01:13:23,994 --> 01:13:26,261
No, no, no.

965
01:13:26,263 --> 01:13:28,130
Not in my parent's house.

966
01:13:28,132 --> 01:13:29,331
Come on, Danielle.

967
01:13:29,333 --> 01:13:30,499
It's just one cigarette.

968
01:13:30,501 --> 01:13:32,635
No, the smoke will
never come out.

969
01:13:32,637 --> 01:13:34,573
All right, I'll go
outside. Fine.

970
01:13:38,476 --> 01:13:40,609
I'm with you.

971
01:13:40,611 --> 01:13:43,011
Hey, don't leave me
alone with these guys.

972
01:13:43,013 --> 01:13:44,149
We'll be right back.

973
01:13:45,115 --> 01:13:46,249
Yeah.

974
01:13:46,251 --> 01:13:48,552
Besides, Dan's kind of cute.

975
01:13:50,922 --> 01:13:53,054
What are you guys
even doing here?

976
01:13:53,056 --> 01:13:54,723
Steph invited us.

977
01:13:54,725 --> 01:13:56,528
She said there was
gonna be a party here.

978
01:13:57,294 --> 01:13:58,728
Well, there's no party,

979
01:13:58,730 --> 01:14:00,429
so, you can leave now.

980
01:14:00,431 --> 01:14:02,331
Danielle, would you
just knock it off?

981
01:14:02,333 --> 01:14:03,635
Live much?

982
01:14:05,169 --> 01:14:06,504
'Bout time you showed up.

983
01:14:07,270 --> 01:14:08,638
We were hanging with Johnny.

984
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:09,871
You know how he is.

985
01:14:09,873 --> 01:14:11,439
Oh, no, you didn't tell him

986
01:14:11,441 --> 01:14:12,608
you were coming here,
did you?

987
01:14:12,610 --> 01:14:14,675
Damn, babe. Take a chill pill.

988
01:14:14,677 --> 01:14:16,344
Is she always
this bitchy?

989
01:14:16,346 --> 01:14:17,746
Don't worry about her.

990
01:14:17,748 --> 01:14:19,717
Let's go upstairs and
I'll make you feel better.

991
01:14:30,427 --> 01:14:32,062
Hey. I'm Dan.

992
01:14:35,365 --> 01:14:37,002
What are you? A lesbian?

993
01:14:41,873 --> 01:14:43,505
I mean, I feel bad for her,

994
01:14:43,507 --> 01:14:45,108
but, at the same time,

995
01:14:45,110 --> 01:14:46,541
Donny was such a jerk.

996
01:14:46,543 --> 01:14:47,878
He really was.

997
01:14:49,180 --> 01:14:50,281
Yeah.

998
01:14:51,248 --> 01:14:52,581
Speaking of.

999
01:14:52,583 --> 01:14:53,749
We better get back in there

1000
01:14:53,751 --> 01:14:55,720
before she freaks out
on everybody.

1001
01:14:56,654 --> 01:14:58,056
I'll be there in a second.

1002
01:15:35,159 --> 01:15:36,327
What, that's it?

1003
01:15:37,262 --> 01:15:39,094
Come on, baby.

1004
01:15:39,096 --> 01:15:40,461
I'm a little drunk.

1005
01:15:40,463 --> 01:15:41,765
Give that a chance.

1006
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:44,002
Whatever, I gotta pee.

1007
01:15:45,269 --> 01:15:46,536
Come on.

1008
01:15:46,538 --> 01:15:47,973
Don't be like that.

1009
01:15:50,607 --> 01:15:52,642
Come on, baby, gimme
like five minutes.

1010
01:15:52,644 --> 01:15:53,943
We'll try again.

1011
01:15:53,945 --> 01:15:55,344
No, I'll give you
one minute,

1012
01:15:55,346 --> 01:15:56,545
and when I get back,

1013
01:15:56,547 --> 01:15:58,149
Little Peter better be ready.

1014
01:16:29,579 --> 01:16:30,813
See, I knew it.

1015
01:16:30,815 --> 01:16:32,350
Little tough love
is all you needed.

1016
01:16:51,535 --> 01:16:52,971
Peter, what the hell?

1017
01:17:45,422 --> 01:17:46,554
Oh, my God.

1018
01:17:46,556 --> 01:17:48,258
What the hell is
going on up there?

1019
01:17:50,294 --> 01:17:51,495
Oh, you know.

1020
01:17:52,296 --> 01:17:53,862
You guys are disgusting.

1021
01:17:53,864 --> 01:17:56,098
What's your problem?

1022
01:17:56,100 --> 01:17:58,300
I don't think you're the one
with the problem, bro.

1023
01:17:59,802 --> 01:18:02,103
Oh, my God.
I have to pee.

1024
01:18:03,606 --> 01:18:05,107
Oh, my gosh, Carla.

1025
01:18:05,109 --> 01:18:07,742
My parents are gonna kill me.

1026
01:18:07,744 --> 01:18:08,979
Whoops!

1027
01:18:10,914 --> 01:18:13,115
You're gonna get it.

1028
01:18:13,117 --> 01:18:14,985
Go wash that up in
the sink or something.

1029
01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:17,489
Fine.

1030
01:19:14,811 --> 01:19:16,545
Looks like the ratio
is improving.

1031
01:19:16,547 --> 01:19:18,116
You gotta act fast, bro.

1032
01:19:22,020 --> 01:19:23,821
What the hell is
that supposed to mean?

1033
01:19:24,422 --> 01:19:25,720
Oh, come on, babe.

1034
01:19:25,722 --> 01:19:26,957
You know what that means.

1035
01:19:30,026 --> 01:19:31,727
Or this is gonna
be the lamest party

1036
01:19:31,729 --> 01:19:33,696
we have ever been to?

1037
01:19:33,698 --> 01:19:35,230
We should have just
stayed at John's.

1038
01:19:35,232 --> 01:19:36,831
I get what you're saying, man.

1039
01:19:36,833 --> 01:19:38,867
But there's enough chicks
here for all of us.

1040
01:19:38,869 --> 01:19:41,136
Look, man, that Regan
chick is still outside.

1041
01:19:41,138 --> 01:19:42,574
She looks like
she's down to party.

1042
01:19:44,609 --> 01:19:46,211
My thoughts exactly, bro.

1043
01:19:54,918 --> 01:19:56,751
Your friend's
a major jerk.

1044
01:19:56,753 --> 01:19:57,987
I'm a little backed up

1045
01:19:57,989 --> 01:19:59,390
if you know what I'm sayin'.

1046
01:20:19,176 --> 01:20:20,378
Carla.

1047
01:20:23,047 --> 01:20:24,449
Carla, is that you?

1048
01:20:33,656 --> 01:20:35,025
Hello.

1049
01:20:41,431 --> 01:20:42,499
Hello.

1050
01:20:45,503 --> 01:20:46,571
Carla.

1051
01:20:48,038 --> 01:20:50,341
You know, just screw
you all, all right.

1052
01:20:57,647 --> 01:20:59,217
This isn't funny.

1053
01:21:04,888 --> 01:21:06,356
What are you doing?

1054
01:21:13,931 --> 01:21:15,300
Boo.

1055
01:21:17,001 --> 01:21:18,500
Johnny, what's up man?

1056
01:21:18,502 --> 01:21:19,634
You came.

1057
01:21:19,636 --> 01:21:21,902
Danielle's in the house, man.
She's gonna freak.

1058
01:21:21,904 --> 01:21:23,505
What's with the costume, bro?

1059
01:21:23,507 --> 01:21:26,241
Ah, you guys are assholes.

1060
01:21:26,243 --> 01:21:28,176
Look, babe, we're
just having some fun.

1061
01:21:28,178 --> 01:21:29,713
You need to relax a bit.

1062
01:21:30,748 --> 01:21:31,880
Whoa.

1063
01:21:31,882 --> 01:21:33,515
Dude, what is your problem?

1064
01:21:33,517 --> 01:21:35,185
What the fuck, man?

1065
01:22:10,988 --> 01:22:12,688
You girls really know
how to throw a party.

1066
01:22:12,690 --> 01:22:13,921
Dick's right.

1067
01:22:13,923 --> 01:22:15,357
It's two of us
and two of you.

1068
01:22:15,359 --> 01:22:17,024
So we should be sitting
here getting it on,

1069
01:22:17,026 --> 01:22:19,161
we're sitting here watching
<i>Attack Of The Brain People.</i>

1070
01:22:19,163 --> 01:22:20,429
Do you see
what you have done?

1071
01:22:20,431 --> 01:22:22,096
No one said you
had to watch it.

1072
01:22:22,098 --> 01:22:23,568
What is your malfunction,
little girl?

1073
01:22:24,101 --> 01:22:25,567
Danielle.

1074
01:22:27,471 --> 01:22:29,071
Oh, what now? Is your
virginity knocking?

1075
01:22:29,073 --> 01:22:30,973
You know what? Why don't
you gather up your goons

1076
01:22:30,975 --> 01:22:32,174
and get the hell out of here.

1077
01:22:32,176 --> 01:22:33,776
Nobody's stopping you.

1078
01:22:33,778 --> 01:22:35,477
Hey, guys, I said shut up.

1079
01:22:35,479 --> 01:22:36,580
What was that sound?

1080
01:22:52,462 --> 01:22:55,997
Wow, he just
does not give up, does he?

1081
01:22:55,999 --> 01:22:57,733
How could this night
get any worse?

1082
01:22:57,735 --> 01:22:59,604
- Come on out, Danielle.
- I'll get rid of him.

1083
01:23:00,236 --> 01:23:02,306
No no, I can handle it.

1084
01:23:03,106 --> 01:23:04,508
Later, lame boy.

1085
01:23:06,008 --> 01:23:07,643
Well, don't let
him in the house.

1086
01:23:07,645 --> 01:23:09,143
After the other day
at the video store

1087
01:23:09,145 --> 01:23:11,478
there's no telling
what he's gonna do.

1088
01:23:11,480 --> 01:23:14,651
Fuck you, and fuck
your flowers, Danielle.

1089
01:23:20,457 --> 01:23:22,191
I'm gonna go make us
some drinks.

1090
01:23:22,193 --> 01:23:26,196
Oh, now, Danielle, one
drink's not gonna hurt you.

1091
01:23:34,171 --> 01:23:35,836
Johnny, you're wasted.

1092
01:23:35,838 --> 01:23:37,305
What are you doing here?

1093
01:23:37,307 --> 01:23:39,741
I just came here
to tell you

1094
01:23:39,743 --> 01:23:43,578
that you are a heartless,
cold-blooded little bitch.

1095
01:23:43,580 --> 01:23:45,980
Oh, that's great.
Real mature.

1096
01:23:45,982 --> 01:23:47,515
Is that all?

1097
01:23:47,517 --> 01:23:48,883
You can leave now.

1098
01:23:48,885 --> 01:23:51,185
What if I don't wanna leave?

1099
01:23:51,187 --> 01:23:53,087
What if I just wanna stay here

1100
01:23:53,089 --> 01:23:55,223
and crash your
little whore party

1101
01:23:55,225 --> 01:23:57,227
with your little
whore friends?

1102
01:23:58,596 --> 01:24:01,197
Will you get out of here
before you hurt yourself?

1103
01:24:01,199 --> 01:24:03,165
Don't you tell me
what to do.

1104
01:24:03,167 --> 01:24:04,933
I don't have to listen to you.

1105
01:24:04,935 --> 01:24:06,437
You're not my mother.

1106
01:24:07,204 --> 01:24:09,036
I'm giving you five minutes,

1107
01:24:09,038 --> 01:24:10,540
and then I'm calling the cops.

1108
01:24:12,075 --> 01:24:14,311
You mean your detective
friend from the other day?

1109
01:24:14,979 --> 01:24:16,478
I knew it.

1110
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:19,046
You're fucking that
asshole cop, aren't you?

1111
01:24:19,048 --> 01:24:20,417
Oh, please.

1112
01:24:20,784 --> 01:24:22,386
Wow. Fine.

1113
01:24:23,086 --> 01:24:24,856
I know when I'm not wanted.

1114
01:24:25,489 --> 01:24:26,822
I'll go.

1115
01:24:26,824 --> 01:24:28,490
But I have just
one more thing

1116
01:24:28,492 --> 01:24:30,561
I wanna say to you
first, Danielle.

1117
01:24:31,695 --> 01:24:33,694
Just one more thing.

1118
01:24:33,696 --> 01:24:35,729
That is?

1119
01:24:35,731 --> 01:24:37,167
What, what is it?

1120
01:24:38,101 --> 01:24:40,138
Johnny, what's wrong?

1121
01:24:54,851 --> 01:24:56,618
Oh, God, oh, God.

1122
01:24:56,620 --> 01:24:57,853
He's dead.

1123
01:24:57,855 --> 01:24:59,420
He killed him.

1124
01:24:59,422 --> 01:25:01,490
What did that asshole
do to you?

1125
01:25:01,492 --> 01:25:03,191
That guy outside,
he killed him.

1126
01:25:03,193 --> 01:25:04,658
He killed Johnny, he's dead.

1127
01:25:04,660 --> 01:25:05,827
What guy?

1128
01:25:05,829 --> 01:25:07,194
That guy with the mask.

1129
01:25:07,196 --> 01:25:09,130
A guy with a mask.

1130
01:25:09,132 --> 01:25:10,965
That's just the boys
messing around

1131
01:25:10,967 --> 01:25:13,303
- that you won't let 'em in.
- Oh, God, he's dead.

1132
01:25:14,238 --> 01:25:15,903
Let me get you a drink.

1133
01:25:15,905 --> 01:25:17,274
You're gonna feel a lot better.

1134
01:25:17,673 --> 01:25:19,310
No, no.

1135
01:25:40,763 --> 01:25:42,199
Oh, my God!

1136
01:26:00,950 --> 01:26:02,050
Oh, shit.

1137
01:26:02,052 --> 01:26:03,487
What the fuck
are we gonna do?

1138
01:26:07,757 --> 01:26:10,291
Okay, okay, okay.

1139
01:26:10,293 --> 01:26:11,628
We'll stay here a minute.

1140
01:26:13,797 --> 01:26:17,366
Danielle, I know
you're scared, but...

1141
01:26:36,320 --> 01:26:38,187
Stay away from
us, don't hurt us.

1142
01:26:38,189 --> 01:26:39,457
You two okay?

1143
01:26:40,856 --> 01:26:42,525
Yeah, who are you?

1144
01:26:43,060 --> 01:26:45,363
I'm here to help.

1145
01:26:46,797 --> 01:26:47,962
How's your friend?

1146
01:26:47,964 --> 01:26:49,163
How do you think she is?

1147
01:26:49,165 --> 01:26:50,598
She's in shock.

1148
01:26:50,600 --> 01:26:53,335
That maniac killed her
boyfriend right in front of her.

1149
01:26:53,337 --> 01:26:55,006
It's okay.
You're safe now.

1150
01:26:56,806 --> 01:26:58,273
Who is that guy?

1151
01:26:58,275 --> 01:26:59,741
He's a psychopath.

1152
01:26:59,743 --> 01:27:00,974
I followed him here.

1153
01:27:00,976 --> 01:27:02,044
No time to explain now.

1154
01:27:02,046 --> 01:27:03,777
Trust me, he's probably
already in the house.

1155
01:27:03,779 --> 01:27:06,348
We need to find something for
you to defend yourselves with.

1156
01:27:06,350 --> 01:27:07,549
Defend ourselves with?

1157
01:27:07,551 --> 01:27:09,117
We need to get
the hell out of here.

1158
01:27:09,119 --> 01:27:11,152
You wanna go out there?
Be my guests.

1159
01:27:11,154 --> 01:27:12,723
You won't last one second
on your own.

1160
01:27:14,391 --> 01:27:15,725
Say the plan.

1161
01:27:22,900 --> 01:27:24,398
You need to keep her quiet.

1162
01:27:24,400 --> 01:27:25,599
Do exactly as I say,

1163
01:27:25,601 --> 01:27:27,470
and I promise we'll
get out of here alive.

1164
01:27:28,805 --> 01:27:30,871
Now, is there anything
we can use in this house

1165
01:27:30,873 --> 01:27:32,376
to protect ourselves with?

1166
01:27:33,977 --> 01:27:36,210
Look, I've got
two shells left.

1167
01:27:36,212 --> 01:27:38,446
We need more than that.

1168
01:27:38,448 --> 01:27:42,384
There's a baseball bat
at the front door.

1169
01:27:42,386 --> 01:27:43,687
Okay, good.

1170
01:27:44,553 --> 01:27:46,321
Is there anyone
else in the house?

1171
01:27:46,323 --> 01:27:47,988
They're all dead.

1172
01:27:47,990 --> 01:27:49,060
Shit.

1173
01:27:50,293 --> 01:27:51,761
We're gonna get that bat.

1174
01:27:52,229 --> 01:27:53,527
Are you crazy?

1175
01:27:53,529 --> 01:27:55,630
I just told you that lunatic
killed all of our friends,

1176
01:27:55,632 --> 01:27:57,933
and now you want us
to help you find him?

1177
01:27:57,935 --> 01:27:59,934
Either that or sit here

1178
01:27:59,936 --> 01:28:01,603
and wait for him to find us.

1179
01:28:01,605 --> 01:28:03,404
Right now we're sitting ducks.

1180
01:28:03,406 --> 01:28:04,906
And he's a hunter.

1181
01:28:04,908 --> 01:28:06,410
We have to move.

1182
01:28:53,455 --> 01:28:54,956
- Freeze!
- Don't shoot, don't shoot.

1183
01:28:54,958 --> 01:28:56,491
Thank God you're alive.

1184
01:28:56,493 --> 01:28:57,692
How did you find us?

1185
01:28:57,694 --> 01:28:59,060
I'll explain later.
Where is he?

1186
01:28:59,062 --> 01:29:01,328
He's in the
house with that other guy.

1187
01:29:01,330 --> 01:29:02,796
He's here too?

1188
01:29:02,798 --> 01:29:04,999
- No, no, please don't leave us.
- No, no.

1189
01:29:05,001 --> 01:29:06,268
He's after you.

1190
01:29:06,270 --> 01:29:08,569
And he won't stop until you
and all your friends are dead.

1191
01:29:08,571 --> 01:29:10,272
But me,
what did I do?

1192
01:29:10,274 --> 01:29:11,939
It's not you,
it's your parents.

1193
01:29:11,941 --> 01:29:13,241
My parents?

1194
01:29:13,243 --> 01:29:15,109
Years ago, his daughter
was killed

1195
01:29:15,111 --> 01:29:16,544
and the whole town
covered it up,

1196
01:29:16,546 --> 01:29:17,847
then the guy got away with it.

1197
01:29:18,547 --> 01:29:20,549
Your father was killed by him.

1198
01:29:20,551 --> 01:29:22,951
No, my father was
killed in the fire.

1199
01:29:22,953 --> 01:29:24,853
No, no there was no fire.

1200
01:29:24,855 --> 01:29:28,122
Your father was the judge who
pushed the trials through.

1201
01:29:28,124 --> 01:29:30,625
He made it so there was no
way he could get a conviction.

1202
01:29:30,627 --> 01:29:32,960
The Ripper killed everyone
he held responsible,

1203
01:29:32,962 --> 01:29:34,831
and we covered it up
with the fire story.

1204
01:29:36,900 --> 01:29:38,633
And now he's back.

1205
01:29:38,635 --> 01:29:40,068
He's back for the children.

1206
01:29:40,070 --> 01:29:42,206
He wants his daughter back
and he thinks you're the key.

1207
01:29:43,906 --> 01:29:45,607
Now look, you two have
gotta get to safety.

1208
01:29:45,609 --> 01:29:46,907
Go to a neighbor's house
or anything.

1209
01:29:46,909 --> 01:29:48,443
And I want you
to call the police,

1210
01:29:48,445 --> 01:29:50,178
and tell Captain Bracken
where we are

1211
01:29:50,180 --> 01:29:51,712
and what's going on.

1212
01:29:51,714 --> 01:29:53,715
- What about that other guy?
- I'll take care of that other guy.

1213
01:29:53,717 --> 01:29:55,550
- You guys, go.
- You can't.

1214
01:29:55,552 --> 01:29:56,921
I said run. Go.

1215
01:31:52,836 --> 01:31:54,167
Shit.

1216
01:31:54,169 --> 01:31:55,672
I thought you were dead.

1217
01:31:57,172 --> 01:31:58,572
Where is he?

1218
01:31:58,574 --> 01:32:00,241
He's gone.

1219
01:32:00,243 --> 01:32:01,876
No, he's not.

1220
01:32:01,878 --> 01:32:03,581
He's still here somewhere.

1221
01:32:04,180 --> 01:32:05,816
I know it.

1222
01:32:11,754 --> 01:32:13,824
He's outside. He's going
after the girls.

1223
01:32:14,658 --> 01:32:16,823
You can't stop him.

1224
01:32:16,825 --> 01:32:18,662
- No one can.
- Yes, I can.

1225
01:32:20,262 --> 01:32:22,029
And when I do,

1226
01:32:22,031 --> 01:32:24,200
I'm gonna bring you
his fucking head.

1227
01:32:26,235 --> 01:32:27,637
No, you won't.

1228
01:32:52,162 --> 01:32:54,429
- Why'd you stop?
- What do you mean?

1229
01:32:54,431 --> 01:32:56,863
- We can't leave them in there alone.
- Are you crazy?

1230
01:32:56,865 --> 01:32:58,265
We have to try to help them.

1231
01:32:58,267 --> 01:33:01,768
No, he told us to go get
help and to wait there.

1232
01:33:01,770 --> 01:33:03,237
That's exactly
what I'm gonna do.

1233
01:33:03,239 --> 01:33:05,807
- Now, let's go.
- Look, he's after me, not them.

1234
01:33:05,809 --> 01:33:08,309
My father started this,
but I have to finish it.

1235
01:33:08,311 --> 01:33:09,710
What are you talking about?

1236
01:33:09,712 --> 01:33:11,679
I'm not going to let them
die for me.

1237
01:33:11,681 --> 01:33:14,015
- We have to try to help.
- No, no no no.

1238
01:33:14,017 --> 01:33:15,183
No, stay here.

1239
01:33:15,185 --> 01:33:16,350
No.

1240
01:33:16,352 --> 01:33:17,718
You just go get help, okay?

1241
01:33:17,720 --> 01:33:19,487
Danielle, come back.

1242
01:33:19,489 --> 01:33:20,790
Danielle.

1243
01:33:28,664 --> 01:33:30,631
What the hell are you doing?

1244
01:33:30,633 --> 01:33:33,100
I won't let you

1245
01:33:33,102 --> 01:33:34,337
get any further.

1246
01:33:35,071 --> 01:33:36,904
Why?

1247
01:33:36,906 --> 01:33:38,907
What the hell
is going on here?

1248
01:33:38,909 --> 01:33:42,010
You thought you were
oh so clever.

1249
01:33:42,012 --> 01:33:45,045
You thought you could
all put this behind you.

1250
01:33:45,047 --> 01:33:46,849
You thought it would
all just go away.

1251
01:33:47,818 --> 01:33:49,850
You were wrong.

1252
01:33:49,852 --> 01:33:51,120
You were wrong.

1253
01:33:52,187 --> 01:33:54,589
This town may have
forgotten what happened,

1254
01:33:54,591 --> 01:33:55,926
but I haven't.

1255
01:33:56,659 --> 01:33:58,228
I loved her, Detective.

1256
01:34:01,096 --> 01:34:03,531
And you all took
her away from me.

1257
01:34:03,533 --> 01:34:05,235
And now you are gonna pay.

1258
01:34:09,605 --> 01:34:10,840
Shit.

1259
01:34:19,481 --> 01:34:20,783
Who are you?

1260
01:34:22,218 --> 01:34:24,986
I'm a man who should
have a wife

1261
01:34:24,988 --> 01:34:27,990
and a child of
his own right now.

1262
01:34:29,059 --> 01:34:30,691
Katie Vatetta was pregnant

1263
01:34:30,693 --> 01:34:33,363
when that son
of a bitch killed her.

1264
01:34:35,798 --> 01:34:37,167
That's my child.

1265
01:34:38,301 --> 01:34:40,037
That was my child!

1266
01:34:41,437 --> 01:34:42,940
Was my future.

1267
01:34:43,873 --> 01:34:45,442
That was my chance
at a family.

1268
01:34:47,577 --> 01:34:50,144
That form you had,

1269
01:34:50,146 --> 01:34:53,316
the one you let slip
through your fingers.

1270
01:35:24,614 --> 01:35:25,915
You're insane.

1271
01:35:27,816 --> 01:35:29,153
Insane?

1272
01:35:31,421 --> 01:35:32,556
No.

1273
01:35:37,461 --> 01:35:42,098
I'm missing the one thing
that made me whole.

1274
01:35:43,499 --> 01:35:45,599
And he

1275
01:35:45,601 --> 01:35:47,470
is gonna bring her
back to me.

1276
01:35:49,239 --> 01:35:50,339
Why?

1277
01:35:51,074 --> 01:35:52,810
Why are you helping him?

1278
01:35:53,476 --> 01:35:54,978
Why now?

1279
01:35:57,780 --> 01:35:59,380
The Ripper found a way

1280
01:35:59,382 --> 01:36:00,584
to bring her back.

1281
01:36:01,984 --> 01:36:05,088
Danielle, she's the one.

1282
01:36:07,155 --> 01:36:09,126
She's gonna be
the resurrection.

1283
01:36:09,624 --> 01:36:11,028
My Katie.

1284
01:36:12,596 --> 01:36:14,598
I have a second chance,
Detective.

1285
01:36:15,597 --> 01:36:18,301
A second chance at a family.

1286
01:36:19,401 --> 01:36:20,436
Yeah.

1287
01:36:21,671 --> 01:36:23,440
One big happy family.

1288
01:36:25,307 --> 01:36:26,342
You,

1289
01:36:28,244 --> 01:36:29,479
a ghost,

1290
01:36:32,315 --> 01:36:33,548
and dear old dad.

1291
01:36:33,550 --> 01:36:36,917
- No, oh, no.
- You let him do your dirty work,

1292
01:36:36,919 --> 01:36:39,222
and you think he's gonna
just let you have her?

1293
01:36:39,454 --> 01:36:41,087
No.

1294
01:36:41,089 --> 01:36:43,657
I won't need him anymore.

1295
01:36:43,659 --> 01:36:45,428
He doesn't even know
who I am.

1296
01:36:47,396 --> 01:36:49,565
Do you think Katie
and I could have told him

1297
01:36:50,667 --> 01:36:53,200
we were gonna have a baby?

1298
01:36:53,202 --> 01:36:56,804
You let them believe that he
molested his own daughter?

1299
01:36:56,806 --> 01:36:58,308
I had nothing
to do with that.

1300
01:37:01,011 --> 01:37:02,412
It was convenient though.

1301
01:37:03,546 --> 01:37:05,211
We're gonna leave.

1302
01:37:05,213 --> 01:37:08,017
Unfortunately,
he was set free,

1303
01:37:09,019 --> 01:37:12,521
and the orphanage sent her
to a foster home.

1304
01:37:15,958 --> 01:37:17,494
And that's where
she was killed.

1305
01:37:21,196 --> 01:37:24,901
And the Ripper came after
all the people

1306
01:37:25,735 --> 01:37:28,105
who let that
drunken asshole

1307
01:37:29,672 --> 01:37:31,007
off the hook.

1308
01:37:32,408 --> 01:37:35,378
I've been trying
to find him for years.

1309
01:37:36,846 --> 01:37:39,947
I need you to find
him for me though.

1310
01:37:39,949 --> 01:37:42,085
But you weren't supposed
to make it this far.

1311
01:37:42,886 --> 01:37:44,751
You were supposed to die

1312
01:37:44,753 --> 01:37:46,122
at the orphanage.

1313
01:37:50,659 --> 01:37:51,960
Thank God I found you.

1314
01:37:51,962 --> 01:37:53,961
- We have to leave right now.
- Why, what happened?

1315
01:37:53,963 --> 01:37:56,130
I'll explain later,
but we really have to go.

1316
01:37:56,132 --> 01:37:58,468
- No, we have to help them.
- No, come on, please.

1317
01:38:03,673 --> 01:38:06,443
No, Carla, no!

1318
01:38:17,520 --> 01:38:20,222
One down, one to go.

1319
01:39:36,565 --> 01:39:38,367
You're never gonna
get away with this.

1320
01:39:38,967 --> 01:39:40,535
Watch me.

1321
01:41:54,136 --> 01:41:56,606
See you in hell, motherfucker.

1322
01:43:29,231 --> 01:43:31,533
Okay, you son of a bitch.

1323
01:43:32,735 --> 01:43:34,671
Come and get me.

1324
01:44:29,458 --> 01:44:32,028
Die, you son of a bitch.

1325
01:45:41,998 --> 01:45:43,362
This one's for my father.

1326
01:46:05,421 --> 01:46:06,923
Say hello to daughter for me.

1327
01:47:09,952 --> 01:47:11,451
Jesus.

1328
01:47:11,453 --> 01:47:13,089
You scared the hell
out of me.

1329
01:47:18,994 --> 01:47:20,195
What happened?

1330
01:47:21,062 --> 01:47:22,097
It's over.

1331
01:47:34,443 --> 01:47:35,979
Sorry about your friend.

1332
01:47:40,214 --> 01:47:41,517
My name's Ryan.

1333
01:47:42,284 --> 01:47:43,752
Danielle.

1334
