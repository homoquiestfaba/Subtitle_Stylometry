00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,822
-AttackSecurity Agency.
- Chico, Guido's CarWash.

00:01:02,929 --> 00:01:06,126
Benny, El Fresco High prom.
Nick, Newmark Mall.

3
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:08,792
And Alvin, missing Essex kid.

4
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:12,429
Trixie, army-navy store. Putyour name
in there. Let's go to work, people!

5
00:01:12,539 --> 00:01:15,599
- Alvin, that was my case!
- Ramon said you weren't interested.

6
00:01:15,708 --> 00:01:17,699
I know what Ramon says
to my backwhen I'm not here.

7
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:19,438
You're late again, Pedro.

8
00:01:19,546 --> 00:01:21,844
You gotta find a very good reason
to do that to me, Ramon...

9
00:01:21,948 --> 00:01:23,745
and even then you can't find it.

10
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:27,877
- Buzz off!. You don't sound sick.
- You promised me a case!

11
00:01:27,987 --> 00:01:30,751
It's time to fish or get offthe pot.

12
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:34,825
What?
Well, you're not readyyet.

13
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:38,159
In uniform at the army-navy store
oryou're fired!

14
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:42,396
Sounds good, don't it?

15
00:01:42,502 --> 00:01:45,471
It sounds good. The thing is,
is it gonna be good?

16
00:01:45,572 --> 00:01:47,631
Come on. Come on.

17
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:49,901
- I got to go.
- All right.

18
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:52,503
Hey.

19
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:54,204
Hey, Trixie.

20
00:01:54,314 --> 00:01:55,747
What?

21
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:58,314
Tasty morsel, ain't he?

22
00:01:58,418 --> 00:02:00,181
More what?

23
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:02,811
You are interested in men, right?

24
00:02:05,592 --> 00:02:06,889
C'est la vie.

25
00:02:06,993 --> 00:02:08,927
" La vie."

26
00:02:09,028 --> 00:02:11,496
- Everything cool?
- Yeah. Everything's fine.

27
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:13,463
Yeah, everything's fine.
You know what?

28
00:02:13,566 --> 00:02:16,433
I was standing over there, and I saw
you put that CD down your pants.

29
00:02:16,536 --> 00:02:18,367
- You did?
- Yeah.

30
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:20,098
Where wereyou standing?

31
00:02:20,206 --> 00:02:23,403
I didn't seeyou put a CD down your
pants. Is that whatyou're telling me?

32
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:26,741
Okay, we can do this the easyway,
orwe can-- Hey, where areyou--

33
00:02:27,914 --> 00:02:29,609
He's got a knife!

34
00:02:37,857 --> 00:02:41,122
Oh, my God! Help me.
Somebody get help!

35
00:02:41,227 --> 00:02:43,388
You're gonna be fine.

36
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:57,775
Hey, Trixie, listen, we're taking up
a collection for Ricardo...

37
00:02:57,877 --> 00:03:02,109
so, you know, ten, five bucks--
whateveryou got.

38
00:03:02,215 --> 00:03:04,183
What, do you want change?

39
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:06,115
Forty bucks?

40
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:11,090
Trixie, a friend called last night.

41
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:13,716
They're looking for casino security
up at Crescents Cove.

42
00:03:13,826 --> 00:03:16,795
Pickpockets, mostly. The regular
security handles the rough stuff.

43
00:03:16,896 --> 00:03:19,524
You don't even need a piece.

44
00:03:19,632 --> 00:03:21,190
No guns?

45
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:24,429
Foryou, maybe a little makeup.

46
00:03:25,438 --> 00:03:28,100
They need an answer, like, now.

47
00:03:47,093 --> 00:03:49,061
Good references.
Great physicals.

48
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:52,290
You know how to gamble, Miss Zurbo?
Blackjack? Craps?

49
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:55,925
Yes, ma'am. Back in Chicago my brother
took me to a private club...

50
00:03:56,035 --> 00:03:58,469
for members
and nonmembers only...

51
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:01,438
and they showed me
how they do it.

52
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:06,007
There's nobody else, Angie.
There is nobody else.

53
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:08,940
Miss Zurbo? Trixie?

54
00:04:09,048 --> 00:04:12,074
You got the job.
Hours are 9:00 to 5:00.

55
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:13,743
P.M. to A.M.

56
00:04:13,853 --> 00:04:17,084
Watching the late, late show

57
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:20,751
Don'tyou wishyou were there
instead ofhere

58
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:24,057
Snuggled in an armchair
with a bottle ofbeer

59
00:04:24,163 --> 00:04:25,528
Anthony Newley!

60
00:04:25,632 --> 00:04:29,329
On your TV
when you're sitting at home

61
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:44,072
This is the biggest jackpot
you've ever won!

62
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:01,394
Okay.

63
00:05:09,575 --> 00:05:11,543
The strawberries.
That's where I had them.

64
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:16,013
I proved beyond a shadow of a doubt,
and with perfect geometric logic...

65
00:05:16,115 --> 00:05:18,583
that an identical key
to the icebox did exist...

66
00:05:18,685 --> 00:05:22,746
and I'd have produced that key ifthey
hadn't pulled the Caine out of action.

67
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,555
Of course...

68
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:31,187
I can only recall these things
from memory.

69
00:05:31,297 --> 00:05:34,664
I'll be glad to answer
any questions you may have.

70
00:05:34,767 --> 00:05:37,361
- Can I get my soda, please?
- You got it.

71
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:40,371
One by one by one.

72
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:45,402
Would anyone care
for a jawbreaker?

73
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:46,876
That's whatyousee
whenyou're sitting at home

74
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,807
New lady bear, right?

75
00:05:51,484 --> 00:05:52,849
" Lady bear?"

76
00:05:52,952 --> 00:05:55,250
- You're under cover.
- Straw, no ice.

77
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,323
- Thanks.
- We both know that.

78
00:05:59,058 --> 00:06:01,492
How'd you know we both know?

79
00:06:01,594 --> 00:06:04,085
Ifyou knew, I wouldn't know.

80
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:06,722
And if I knew,
you sure wouldn't know, either.

81
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:09,563
I was just saying
you look real good out there.

82
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:12,866
Did you ever take a look
at the superstars?

83
00:06:12,972 --> 00:06:14,701
You know what their thing is?

84
00:06:14,807 --> 00:06:16,434
It's hair.

85
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:19,409
You're gonna be a star,
you gotta know how to fix your hair.

86
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,448
And I got plenty of it.

87
00:06:23,816 --> 00:06:26,114
Cagneybelting Bogey

88
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,551
And Edward G. with his stogie

89
00:06:28,654 --> 00:06:31,521
You see that guy
right over there?

90
00:06:31,624 --> 00:06:33,114
He wants you.

91
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:36,024
You're out ofyour rocker.
I don't even know him.

92
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:38,962
He wants every woman
that walks into this place.

93
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:42,592
Come here.
He don't wear any drawers.

94
00:06:42,702 --> 00:06:45,637
A real statue of Adonis.

95
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:52,578
But I still hate him.

96
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:57,481
Mae West,
"Oh, come up andsee me"

97
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:00,051
And Chevalier with his
"Mimi, Mimi"

98
00:07:01,187 --> 00:07:02,484
How rude.

99
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:04,918
I'm Ruby Pearli.

100
00:07:05,792 --> 00:07:07,817
Been coming here foryears.

101
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,758
It's Trixie, right?

102
00:07:09,862 --> 00:07:13,025
Won'tyou come home, Bill Bailey
Won'tyou come home

103
00:07:13,132 --> 00:07:16,260
And watch the late, late show

104
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:19,497
Listen, I'm gonna make him
an offer he can't refuse.

105
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:22,938
I watch the late, late show

106
00:07:23,042 --> 00:07:26,409
Norman, look. The loons!

107
00:07:26,512 --> 00:07:31,415
Watching that late, late show

108
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:37,446
We're coming up on 6:30 in the morning
here in Crescents Cove.

109
00:07:37,557 --> 00:07:38,990
Kind ofa chilly morning...

110
00:07:39,091 --> 00:07:41,525
about 50 degrees out there,
but don'tyou folks worry.

111
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:44,425
I think we'll get to 70 degrees this
afternoon when those clouds clear off...

112
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:46,521
and it'll be a nice day
down by the lake.

113
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:49,760
$ " Grizley's Motor Court"

114
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:42,845
Thank you for being
such a wonderful audience.

115
00:08:42,955 --> 00:08:45,287
There's a lot of love i n this room,
ladies and gentlemen.

116
00:08:45,391 --> 00:08:47,416
It's either that
or carbon monoxide.

117
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:50,587
But, seriously,
ifyou're driving tonight...

118
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:52,687
please don't forgetyour car.

119
00:08:53,766 --> 00:08:55,825
Mr. Stans, that was fantastic.

120
00:08:55,935 --> 00:08:58,426
We sawyou in that community telethon
you did with What's-his-name.

121
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,403
- You were so good.
- Thanks.

122
00:09:00,506 --> 00:09:02,531
Ifyou're ever down
in the McAllen-Brownsville area...

123
00:09:02,642 --> 00:09:05,702
we have a tractor pull in late August,
and you are most welcome.

124
00:09:05,811 --> 00:09:07,836
I won't miss it.
Thankyou.

125
00:09:12,585 --> 00:09:14,450
The price offame.

126
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:18,415
So how goes the dawn patrol?

127
00:09:18,524 --> 00:09:20,355
Job like that's gotta be tough.

128
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:22,620
I can handle it.

129
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:25,356
I'm sureyou can handle it.

130
00:09:25,464 --> 00:09:27,762
Betyou don't spend
even one second concerned...

131
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:31,268
whether blood's bubbling
from a guy's mouth or not.

132
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:34,771
You can't just sit there like
a sore thumb. I'll tell you that much.

133
00:09:35,675 --> 00:09:36,903
Exactly.

134
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:39,136
Right away, Mr. Stans.

135
00:09:41,981 --> 00:09:44,211
You're very observant.

136
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:47,912
Drinking into oblivion
is my second-favorite hobby.

137
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:51,285
Drinking into a stupor
is my first.

138
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:53,688
I do it to remember.

139
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:55,886
Or forget, I'm never sure which.

140
00:09:58,197 --> 00:10:00,131
So, Miss Trix...

141
00:10:00,232 --> 00:10:02,029
where areyou from?

142
00:10:02,134 --> 00:10:04,762
I was born in Chicago.
Guess I'm from there.

143
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:07,464
My kind oftown, Chicago is.

144
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:12,073
- It's okay.
- Family there?

145
00:10:12,178 --> 00:10:14,510
They died, mostly.

146
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:18,675
My mom died.
She had cancer from cigarettes.

147
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:20,615
My brother died too.

148
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,847
He was a cop.

149
00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:25,489
He was a good cop.

150
00:10:25,591 --> 00:10:28,992
My sister Gloria moved
to Minnesota with her husband.

151
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:31,188
She's expecting a baby.

152
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:35,631
But I don't know if I'm
gonna be an uncle or an auntyet.

153
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:39,504
I haven't met my father...

154
00:10:39,605 --> 00:10:41,766
so he may not be dead.

155
00:10:41,874 --> 00:10:44,866
Though plenty of people
around his age are dead now...

156
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:46,968
so he could be dead.

157
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:51,006
I loved my brother.

158
00:10:51,117 --> 00:10:52,516
Yeah.

159
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:58,957
Know what I love, Trixie?

160
00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:01,917
No.

161
00:11:02,028 --> 00:11:05,327
I love how we go on.

162
00:11:06,565 --> 00:11:09,056
And we all somehow manage...

163
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:11,693
to just keep going on.

164
00:11:11,804 --> 00:11:12,793
Yeah.

165
00:11:12,905 --> 00:11:17,672
I came up here 'cause I think that
there were brighter clouds ahead for me.

166
00:11:17,777 --> 00:11:19,301
Like this job.

167
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:22,381
And you're an expert at finding
your man, aren'tyou, Trixie?

168
00:11:22,481 --> 00:11:24,346
And keeping him ifyou want.

169
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:26,418
I haven't been
on an actual caseyet...

170
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:29,386
but I know that when I get
on the trail of somebody...

171
00:11:29,488 --> 00:11:31,979
I'm gonna get him
by hook or by ladder.

172
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:34,719
See, a lot of guys out there
think that it's about 50-50...

173
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:39,526
between the evidence thatyou find
and your own institution.

174
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,965
But I think
that it's just the opposite.

175
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,868
I thinkyou gotta
grab the bull by the tail...

176
00:11:46,972 --> 00:11:49,065
and look it in the eye.

177
00:11:49,175 --> 00:11:51,405
And I guess I'm different
in that way.

178
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:54,946
You're different, all right.
In a lot ofways.

179
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:57,413
Exceptyou're not a guy.

180
00:11:57,516 --> 00:12:00,144
I'm a feminine--
I'm female.

181
00:12:00,252 --> 00:12:02,220
You mean a woman.

182
00:12:02,922 --> 00:12:04,480
Yeah. A woman.

183
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:07,787
And in your case, I'm sure
that's just the tip ofthe iceberg.

184
00:12:10,996 --> 00:12:13,157
But what about danger, Trixie?

185
00:12:14,133 --> 00:12:16,328
- Danger?
- Yeah.

186
00:12:16,435 --> 00:12:18,096
Can you handle it?

187
00:12:18,204 --> 00:12:22,937
Notjust cops and robbers,
but demons in the underbrush.

188
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:25,408
When it's a matter
ofyou or them.

189
00:12:25,511 --> 00:12:28,071
Like, doyou mean,
do I have an ace up my hole?

190
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:30,148
No, I mean...

191
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:33,884
could you pull the trigger?

192
00:12:33,986 --> 00:12:35,283
Bang.

193
00:12:37,556 --> 00:12:39,114
Okay.

194
00:12:40,392 --> 00:12:42,257
Well...

195
00:12:42,361 --> 00:12:46,195
there's only one person besides me who
could saywhat I'd do, and that's me.

196
00:12:46,298 --> 00:12:47,595
I see.

197
00:12:47,733 --> 00:12:49,098
Doctor, refill my prescription.

198
00:13:17,696 --> 00:13:19,960
That guy smokes like a fish.

199
00:13:20,065 --> 00:13:22,033
You mean Dex?
Mr. Dexterous?

200
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:24,625
He works for Red Rafferty.

201
00:13:24,737 --> 00:13:26,728
Who's Red Rafferty?

202
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:29,467
Land developer, entrepreneur...

203
00:13:29,575 --> 00:13:32,544
and a vulgarian
of the highest order.

204
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,704
You mean like the Shriners?

205
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:37,644
Let's just say...

206
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:41,311
removing warts from his ass
might be called brain surgery.

207
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,047
You know what I mean?

208
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:45,385
Hey, Robert Goulet!

209
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:48,016
Yes, Robert Goulet.

210
00:13:48,127 --> 00:13:50,027
Uncanny, isn't it?

211
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:54,363
So what does Mr. Dexterous do?

212
00:13:55,568 --> 00:13:57,536
Mr. Dexterous
butters his own bread.

213
00:13:57,636 --> 00:14:01,072
He's Red's deckhand,
jack-of-all-trades...

214
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:04,301
probably pokes Red's wife
when Red's out of town.

215
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:07,402
Red's usually busy
with his girlfriend Dawn.

216
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:09,708
Although I'm sure
Dawn does all the work.

217
00:14:09,815 --> 00:14:11,840
But what do I know?

218
00:14:11,951 --> 00:14:13,418
I like the accordion.

219
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:17,580
- Hey, that's my favorite music!
- How did I know that?

220
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:23,190
See, we're each tap dancers
in the canoe oflife.

221
00:14:23,295 --> 00:14:26,458
Whatyou must do, Trixie,
is tip well.

222
00:14:26,565 --> 00:14:28,590
That's what my mom taught me.

223
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:30,328
She was a waitress.

224
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:32,233
She said,
"Ifyou tip a better amount...

225
00:14:32,338 --> 00:14:34,863
you'll feel good aboutyourself,
which helps your bone structure."

226
00:14:34,974 --> 00:14:37,067
Of course it does.

227
00:14:37,176 --> 00:14:39,007
It's certainly helped yours.

228
00:14:39,111 --> 00:14:42,274
One simple glance tells me
how generous you are.

229
00:14:52,191 --> 00:14:54,887
I've seen that guy here before.
I don't trust him.

230
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:03,562
That woman's tongue
is highly contagious.

231
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:07,605
Egads, listen to that.
I'm already starting to sound like her.

232
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:12,708
Okay, shooter coming out.

233
00:15:12,811 --> 00:15:15,974
Lucky six.
Six is rolled.

234
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:18,845
The view from here
is spectacular.

235
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:21,852
But always be up front with a lady.
You winning?

236
00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:25,685
What?
No, I'm not winning.

237
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:28,351
Well, nowyou are.

238
00:15:29,161 --> 00:15:30,788
I'm Dex.

239
00:15:30,896 --> 00:15:32,864
Short for Dexter, Ambidextrous--

240
00:15:32,965 --> 00:15:35,456
It's not my name at all,
but that's what it's short for.

241
00:15:35,567 --> 00:15:37,262
I missed yours.

242
00:15:44,176 --> 00:15:45,973
A quiet girl.

243
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,505
Shoo.

244
00:15:52,484 --> 00:15:54,577
What do I look like,
a fly or something?

245
00:15:54,687 --> 00:15:58,646
Yeah. You look like a fly.
Now go away.

246
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:14,496
Let me see whatyou got.

247
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:25,678
I've lived here 20 years.
Seen that water turn from blue to black.

248
00:16:25,784 --> 00:16:27,513
It's the developers.

249
00:16:27,619 --> 00:16:32,022
Says here that the government's
gonna help save it from itself.

250
00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:35,719
" Light at the end ofthe tunnel"?
More like an oncoming train.

251
00:16:58,751 --> 00:17:01,845
This is my regular hangout.
This is my regulartable.

252
00:17:01,954 --> 00:17:03,922
That's where I sit.

253
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:05,650
Not now.

254
00:17:11,296 --> 00:17:13,025
Quiet girl.

255
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:18,496
Would you stop saying that?
I am not quiet.

256
00:17:19,171 --> 00:17:21,071
Relax. It's a compliment.

257
00:17:21,774 --> 00:17:23,264
Coffee, Dex?

258
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,104
- Yes.
- The usual?

259
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,610
- Yeah.
- Medium rare.

260
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:29,010
Right.

261
00:17:31,683 --> 00:17:34,550
You wanna stay competitive, you should
eat something more substantial...

262
00:17:34,653 --> 00:17:37,281
Iike a nice, thickjuicy steak.

263
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:41,348
I wouldn't eat a steak
ifitwas on a ten-foot pole.

264
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:45,223
Steak eaters are superior people.

265
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:48,493
You can eat steaks up the kazoo,
but not me.

266
00:17:51,036 --> 00:17:52,970
So how 'bout it?

267
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:55,199
You wanna make love
with me tonight?

268
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:02,670
Okay.

269
00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:05,716
Okay, but you can't
blame a guy for asking.

270
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,151
See, I know what women want.

271
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:12,723
So I'm polite, and I ask 'em.

272
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:16,027
You do like guys, don'tyou?

273
00:18:16,128 --> 00:18:18,255
I wish I had an answer
for that question...

274
00:18:18,363 --> 00:18:20,991
'cause I am really getting tired
ofanswering it.

275
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,125
Why? Don'tyou know?

276
00:18:23,235 --> 00:18:25,169
A virgin maybe?

277
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,330
No, too old.

278
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:32,035
I mean, you're probably
not that active.

279
00:18:32,144 --> 00:18:34,874
I could see how
you might like girls.

280
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:37,949
But a virgin?
No, I don't think so.

281
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:41,451
Why do people always have
to beat a dead horse to death?

282
00:18:41,553 --> 00:18:44,750
Everybody talks about sex, so it ain't
no big deal most ofthe time.

283
00:18:44,857 --> 00:18:47,655
Butyou know why they talk
about it so much, don'tyou?

284
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:49,158
You know?

285
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:51,024
Because they don't do it.

286
00:18:52,064 --> 00:18:54,965
You see, I do it,
I talk about it...

287
00:18:55,067 --> 00:18:57,297
and I make no bones.

288
00:18:58,737 --> 00:19:00,705
Except maybe the one.

289
00:19:04,676 --> 00:19:07,338
So what doyou say, quiet girl?
You a virgin, orwhat?

290
00:19:07,446 --> 00:19:10,847
No, I am not a virgin, okay?

291
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:15,343
Neither am I.

292
00:19:16,855 --> 00:19:18,482
I didn't think so.

293
00:19:23,128 --> 00:19:25,153
So how was it foryou?

294
00:19:31,603 --> 00:19:35,004
See? This is what I'm talking about,
and it burns my ass.

295
00:19:35,107 --> 00:19:38,873
Ifyou're gonna be stingy,
whywaste it on an amateur?

296
00:19:39,945 --> 00:19:42,311
Most guys, they don't know
how to touch a woman.

297
00:19:42,414 --> 00:19:44,041
You have no idea.

298
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:49,086
Listen, I'm not a bad guy.

299
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,850
You should take
some time to know me.

300
00:19:51,957 --> 00:19:54,482
I don't have to knowyou,
'cause I already knowya.

301
00:19:54,593 --> 00:19:55,560
Right.

302
00:19:55,661 --> 00:19:58,152
The sleuth. Okay.

303
00:19:58,263 --> 00:20:01,232
How's about doing a little sleuthing
right now? See how closeyou come.

304
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:03,528
Pretty simple, I'm sure.

305
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:06,561
I dareyou.

306
00:20:14,513 --> 00:20:16,481
Let me see, now.

307
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:23,082
You've been buttering up
your own nest.

308
00:20:23,188 --> 00:20:25,554
You've gone to the top
ofthe tree...

309
00:20:25,657 --> 00:20:29,423
and you have caught
the tip ofthe iceberg.

310
00:20:29,528 --> 00:20:32,326
Doyou hearyourselftalking
when you speak?

311
00:20:32,431 --> 00:20:34,490
'Cause this is some lame shit.
You're disappointing me.

312
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,899
Oh, yeah? Okay.

313
00:20:38,003 --> 00:20:39,470
Number one:

314
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:44,270
I'd sayyou're a Jekyll-of-all-trades
for an ass named Red Rafferty.

315
00:20:44,376 --> 00:20:45,673
Number two:

316
00:20:45,777 --> 00:20:49,873
Your main job is when he's not in town,
when he's some place else...

317
00:20:49,982 --> 00:20:53,474
so thatyou can guard
the body ofhis wife...

318
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:58,079
ifyou're not too busy
posing for statues of Adidas.

319
00:20:59,024 --> 00:21:00,651
How am I doing?

320
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:02,750
Medium rare.

321
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:17,667
We can sleep as late as we want.
Nothing to bother us.

322
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:21,769
Just the waves lapping
against theyacht where I live.

323
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:24,508
Well, you already know
that it's Red's charter boat...

324
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:27,244
but I live there
all by my lonesome.

325
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,918
Massage those tired feet ofyours.

326
00:21:31,023 --> 00:21:32,991
Makeyou laugh.

327
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:37,385
When's the last time
you had a really good laugh?

328
00:22:17,869 --> 00:22:20,667
Don't monkey around.
I'm working.

329
00:22:20,772 --> 00:22:22,933
First a fly, now a monkey?

330
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:25,066
That really hurts.
I'm not even human toyou.

331
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:26,872
I didn't say that.

332
00:22:26,978 --> 00:22:29,412
Hey, I got 20/20 hearing.

333
00:22:31,817 --> 00:22:33,978
I didn't mean it.

334
00:22:34,086 --> 00:22:37,078
Most people condescend
from monkeys anyways.

335
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:39,453
- Did you learn that in school?
- No.

336
00:22:39,558 --> 00:22:43,324
I had to quit school in fifth grade
to take care of my mom.

337
00:22:43,428 --> 00:22:45,328
I hated school.

338
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:49,764
My old man wanted me to go
to college, be a big success like him.

339
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:54,100
But I turned my back on all that.
Who needs all that money, anyway?

340
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:57,039
- I only need what I want.
- Dex.

341
00:23:02,914 --> 00:23:04,973
So...

342
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:07,745
you halfin love with meyet?

343
00:24:01,206 --> 00:24:02,503
Hop aboard.

344
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:04,472
I don't know how.

345
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:08,246
Just come to the end
and step across.

346
00:24:10,182 --> 00:24:12,082
What ifit sinks?

347
00:24:12,184 --> 00:24:13,344
Can't swim?

348
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:16,182
Of course I can swim,
but not ifI'm on a boat.

349
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:19,849
I've never been
on a boat before.

350
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:22,859
Just step across.
Watch the slippery part.

351
00:24:28,366 --> 00:24:29,765
Okay.

352
00:24:33,405 --> 00:24:36,033
Okay.
You're all right.

353
00:24:40,345 --> 00:24:42,370
You're all right.

354
00:24:44,282 --> 00:24:45,909
Okay?

355
00:25:00,899 --> 00:25:02,628
Oh, shit.

356
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:16,337
I am totally naked
without any clothes on.

357
00:25:17,282 --> 00:25:18,749
Yeah.

358
00:25:20,285 --> 00:25:22,185
Turn around.

359
00:25:25,991 --> 00:25:29,256
Listen, I forgot about
this cruise I got today.

360
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:33,530
You can handle it.

361
00:25:34,332 --> 00:25:36,197
You'll have a ball.

362
00:25:37,836 --> 00:25:40,896
- Stay right there. I'll be right back.
- Bring my clothes.

363
00:26:04,095 --> 00:26:06,063
What cakeyou pop out of?

364
00:26:09,834 --> 00:26:11,927
Loverboy's latest, eh?

365
00:26:12,871 --> 00:26:14,600
I guess he's slippin'.

366
00:26:16,341 --> 00:26:19,310
- Red, sorry. She's--
- I know what she is.

367
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:22,812
You just getyour ass up there
and sprinkle roses for the Senator...

368
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:24,643
and you get out some cashew nuts.

369
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:26,717
The good ones.

370
00:26:26,818 --> 00:26:29,753
- Dex, I want my clothes.
- Now!

371
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:34,415
Yeah. Right. Okay.

372
00:26:38,363 --> 00:26:41,230
He's an idiot.
What's your excuse?

373
00:26:47,906 --> 00:26:49,840
Do you speak?

374
00:26:51,209 --> 00:26:52,574
Let me see something.

375
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:55,140
Excuse me.

376
00:26:55,246 --> 00:26:58,841
I'm Red Rafferty.
This is my boat.

377
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:02,351
I know this is your boat.
You're Red Rafferty.

378
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:04,012
That's what I said.

379
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:21,198
Hey, Red, Senator Avery's car's
pulling up right now.

380
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:26,638
It's too bad foryou I got
more important things to do right now.

381
00:27:27,245 --> 00:27:30,373
Let's hope there's enough
life jackets to go around.

382
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:33,110
That's all I got to say about it.

383
00:27:36,221 --> 00:27:40,123
The loose fish is okay, loverboy.
She might even come in handy.

384
00:27:44,529 --> 00:27:47,191
Ifyou can't keep quiet, shut up.

385
00:27:56,307 --> 00:27:59,333
- Should be fun, huh?
- I want my clothes.

386
00:28:00,311 --> 00:28:02,176
You look great. Really.

387
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:05,010
You may be a big clog in his wheels,
but not in mine.

388
00:28:05,116 --> 00:28:06,913
I just want to get off.

389
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:08,645
I knew that.

390
00:28:11,056 --> 00:28:12,887
Go away.

391
00:28:30,475 --> 00:28:32,033
What a life, huh?

392
00:28:32,143 --> 00:28:34,168
Yeah, it's a party
of doom and gloom.

393
00:28:35,113 --> 00:28:38,947
I like to come out here
and let my mind swing free.

394
00:28:40,151 --> 00:28:44,053
You don't wanna letyour mind
swing too free. You'd loseyour head.

395
00:28:44,155 --> 00:28:46,715
Don'tyou worry
about that with me, sir.

396
00:28:48,493 --> 00:28:50,358
What is it going
to be, Drummond?

397
00:28:50,462 --> 00:28:52,794
- You want the usual?
- Yeah. Scotch, neat.

398
00:28:53,631 --> 00:28:55,496
- Two?
- Two fingers.

399
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,864
'Cause I know
what can happen to you.

400
00:28:57,969 --> 00:29:00,733
Ifl start pouring these drinks,
things can--

401
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:03,069
Walt, you know what
the best audience is?

402
00:29:03,174 --> 00:29:04,334
What's that?

403
00:29:04,442 --> 00:29:07,070
Intelligent, a little educated,
and damn drunk.

404
00:29:07,178 --> 00:29:08,975
I'll keep that in mind.

405
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:14,618
Jesus, watch it!
You want me to crash or something?

406
00:29:14,719 --> 00:29:18,086
Turn this boat right around now,
oryou are dead meat in thewater.

407
00:29:18,189 --> 00:29:20,419
I alreadyforgot about this
goddamn cruise because ofyou.

408
00:29:20,525 --> 00:29:24,086
I crash the boat, six people
including the state senator drown.

409
00:29:24,195 --> 00:29:25,526
And it's your fault.

410
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:28,155
Yesterday I didn't get to say
something that needs repeatin'.

411
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:31,493
I don't wanna ever seeyou again.

412
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:34,265
And I don't wantyou ever
to see me again, either.

413
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:54,486
Boy's got a new girlfriend,
and he's turned into a maniac.

414
00:29:54,592 --> 00:29:56,822
Kind ofinteresting, though.

415
00:30:07,405 --> 00:30:10,465
Listen, Avery, I was just
thinking ofsomething.

416
00:30:10,575 --> 00:30:12,873
- Who's that?
- Red's partners.

417
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:14,342
Her.

418
00:30:16,114 --> 00:30:17,479
Her?

419
00:30:17,582 --> 00:30:19,447
Red's friend. A singer.
Dawn Sloane.

420
00:30:19,551 --> 00:30:21,883
And you know her, don'tyou?
Even though she's older.

421
00:30:25,089 --> 00:30:27,319
I got a good one
foryou, Drummond.

422
00:30:28,226 --> 00:30:29,716
Oh, yeah? What's that?

423
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:31,819
How can you tell
a Polack at a cockfight?

424
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:35,024
- He's the one with the duck.
- One with the duck. That's not bad.

425
00:30:39,904 --> 00:30:42,031
How doyou tell a wop
at a cockfight?

426
00:30:44,409 --> 00:30:47,207
He's the one bettin'
on the duck.

427
00:30:47,312 --> 00:30:50,110
- Bettin' on the duck, eh?
- How doyou tell the Mob's been there?

428
00:30:50,215 --> 00:30:54,811
I don't know. I thinkwe gotta vote
for some senators with breasts.

429
00:30:54,919 --> 00:30:57,080
We've been voting
for boobs long enough.

430
00:30:57,188 --> 00:30:59,349
The duckwins.

431
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:03,217
The duckwins.
I don't get that one.

432
00:31:04,429 --> 00:31:06,693
I'm absolutely ravishing.
Where's the food?

433
00:31:06,798 --> 00:31:08,925
Well, the nuts are over there.

434
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:15,733
Happyyet?

435
00:31:20,111 --> 00:31:22,671
Hey, no!
I'll go.

436
00:31:30,021 --> 00:31:32,080
Check out Miss America here!

437
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:34,158
Hey, fish, how would you like
to be in a movie?

438
00:31:34,259 --> 00:31:36,557
You got any talent there?
Let me checkyou out.

439
00:31:48,506 --> 00:31:51,100
Sid, when I wantyour opinion,
I'll give it toyou, okay?

440
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:55,136
Walter, exactlywhere
is that property line ofyours?

441
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:58,215
- In your pocket?
- I'll showyou. Okay, fish.

442
00:32:03,688 --> 00:32:07,647
What areyou doing?
You getyour hands off me.

443
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:10,751
Easy, Red. Take a look at her.
She ain't worth it.

444
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:18,064
You get this punch bunny
off my boat...

445
00:32:18,169 --> 00:32:20,933
or I'm gonna toss you both
over face first, you got it?

446
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:23,337
- You and what army?
- Okay, here we go!

447
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:26,569
- All right. All right.
- Hold it.

448
00:32:26,678 --> 00:32:27,906
Wait a minute!

449
00:32:28,012 --> 00:32:29,775
All right, hold it.
Hold it now.

450
00:32:29,881 --> 00:32:32,975
- Hold it a second!
- I'm all right.

451
00:32:33,084 --> 00:32:35,018
- Hold it.
- I'm all right.

452
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:38,011
Now listen to me.

453
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:39,953
I'm gonna say one thing...

454
00:32:40,058 --> 00:32:41,889
and I'm gonna say it once.

455
00:32:42,827 --> 00:32:44,590
This is like a circus.

456
00:32:44,696 --> 00:32:47,995
You people are behaving
like clowns.

457
00:32:48,099 --> 00:32:52,661
And it's embarrassing. I'm supposed
to be out here enjoying myself!.

458
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:54,738
And, quite frankly,
this behavior--

459
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:57,808
this clown behavior--
is a little scary for me.

460
00:32:57,909 --> 00:33:01,436
As a child, my father
took me to the circus...

461
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,814
and a clown killed him.

462
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:12,617
Walter, I wantyou to apologize
to this young lady.

463
00:33:14,726 --> 00:33:17,456
I wantyou to behave a little more
gentlemanly towards her.

464
00:33:17,562 --> 00:33:18,927
I mean...

465
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:22,693
this young lady right here
might tearyou apart!

466
00:33:25,737 --> 00:33:29,366
- She might just ripyou a new asshole.
- You might be right about that.

467
00:33:29,474 --> 00:33:32,841
Yeah, come on.
Show me this property line ofyours.

468
00:33:32,944 --> 00:33:35,845
Come on over here.
How much moneyyou got in the bank?

469
00:33:35,947 --> 00:33:37,608
Let me see.

470
00:33:37,715 --> 00:33:40,149
Okay, Trixie.

471
00:33:40,251 --> 00:33:41,741
Come on.

472
00:33:44,489 --> 00:33:46,787
All right.
That's it.

473
00:34:00,104 --> 00:34:02,595
Happy now?
Huh, baby?

474
00:34:04,308 --> 00:34:06,333
Baby's not happy.

475
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:24,252
Okay, I told you I'd get you here
safe and sound, didn't I?

476
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:26,690
That's it.

477
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:35,403
I know whereyou live, Trixie.

478
00:34:35,506 --> 00:34:37,474
I can makeyou talk to me.

479
00:35:07,371 --> 00:35:10,033
You're not
very hungry today, honey.

480
00:35:10,141 --> 00:35:12,041
You get some sleep.

481
00:35:16,481 --> 00:35:18,244
What a little shock!

482
00:35:18,349 --> 00:35:21,648
You want a tampon or a lollipop?
Little goodies. Anything?

483
00:35:21,752 --> 00:35:24,448
So what'd you do on your day off?

484
00:35:24,555 --> 00:35:27,251
Spend it with all
the wrong people, like Dex?

485
00:35:28,726 --> 00:35:31,286
Did he takeyou on one
ofthose floating orgies...

486
00:35:31,395 --> 00:35:34,125
with Red and that phony slut Dawn?

487
00:35:36,767 --> 00:35:39,031
How old areyou, anyways?

488
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:41,435
Here, look foryourself.

489
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:45,741
I don't got two pair ofhands.
You read it to me.

490
00:35:46,844 --> 00:35:49,244
I got one that says "29."

491
00:35:49,347 --> 00:35:51,042
One says "22."

492
00:35:53,217 --> 00:35:54,616
"Sixteen."

493
00:36:07,732 --> 00:36:09,597
Jiggers, the heat!

494
00:36:11,402 --> 00:36:13,267
Make that two jiggers.

495
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:17,504
So how's Trix?

496
00:36:21,612 --> 00:36:25,309
What's wrong, sunshine?
Nobody to playwith?

497
00:36:25,416 --> 00:36:29,648
- Tell me more about those guys.
- Which guys?

498
00:36:29,754 --> 00:36:34,953
Red Rafferty and the DeFlore brothers.
They look like phonographers.

499
00:36:35,059 --> 00:36:39,496
Don't go fishing in darkwaters.
Forget about them.

500
00:36:39,597 --> 00:36:41,531
They're lethal.

501
00:36:41,632 --> 00:36:44,362
You mean like they got
good lawyers and stuff?

502
00:36:44,468 --> 00:36:48,336
No. Lethal as in deadly.

503
00:36:48,439 --> 00:36:52,136
For the DeFlores,
it's always about fists.

504
00:36:52,243 --> 00:36:54,575
Vince was 1 4 before he knew
he had fingers.

505
00:36:55,479 --> 00:36:58,778
Then again, inbreeding is how
we get championship horses.

506
00:37:00,251 --> 00:37:02,310
As for Red...

507
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:04,718
to put it
soyou might understand...

508
00:37:04,822 --> 00:37:09,691
the sword of Damocles is hanging
over Pandora's Box.

509
00:37:11,662 --> 00:37:15,120
Is that like cutting offyour nose
in spite ofyour face?

510
00:37:15,833 --> 00:37:16,800
Close.

511
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:19,631
Red can't afford to build
overpriced condominiums...

512
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:22,706
because schmoes like us
can't afford to buy them.

513
00:37:22,807 --> 00:37:26,265
You might say
his limits are limitless.

514
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:31,175
And the politics guy?

515
00:37:31,282 --> 00:37:33,682
Big fish in a small pond.

516
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:40,083
I'd love to be an eardropper
on thewall when they're talking.

517
00:37:40,191 --> 00:37:42,489
Kirk, anotherfive minutes.

518
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:44,754
Five minutes.

519
00:37:44,862 --> 00:37:49,094
Towhat? I've left more people
than this in bed.

520
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:53,000
What about Dawn Sloane?
I mean, she's no fried chicken.

521
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:55,937
Oh, baby, now
Yeah,yeah

522
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:59,339
All overyou

523
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:00,910
That's her.

524
00:38:01,012 --> 00:38:05,005
Wow
What can I do

525
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:07,607
Oh, baby, now
Yeah,yeah

526
00:38:09,987 --> 00:38:11,955
Want to complete 20 questions...

527
00:38:12,056 --> 00:38:13,956
and ask what
I think of Dex Lang?

528
00:38:15,726 --> 00:38:17,091
No.

529
00:38:42,219 --> 00:38:44,517
I quit Red tonight.

530
00:38:44,622 --> 00:38:47,785
Unloaded on
the sadistic son of a bitch.

531
00:38:50,361 --> 00:38:52,488
He's being shitty to Dawn.

532
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:15,815
They're crazy.
You don't know the half ofit.

533
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,150
Goddamn crooked politician.

534
00:39:18,255 --> 00:39:20,883
I did not like the way
he was looking atyou.

535
00:39:34,271 --> 00:39:36,899
I've neverwanted a woman
the way I wantyou.

536
00:40:36,567 --> 00:40:38,159
Wait. Shit.

537
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:40,669
- Wait. Hold on.
- Oh, yeah. Come on.

538
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,067
Wait a second.

539
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,785
Where's Dawn?

540
00:41:04,895 --> 00:41:06,988
Where is she?

541
00:41:12,002 --> 00:41:14,527
Where's the goddamn tape?

542
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:29,117
Come on, Sid.
He don't know nothin'.

543
00:41:32,623 --> 00:41:34,113
Seeya later.

544
00:41:38,729 --> 00:41:41,357
- Quit screwing around, Sid.
- All right, let's eat. I'm hungry.

545
00:41:41,465 --> 00:41:43,956
- Chinese?
- Sure.

546
00:41:44,068 --> 00:41:46,628
When I was a kid, I got hit
on the head with a bowling ball...

547
00:41:46,737 --> 00:41:49,228
and I woke up unconscious.

548
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:51,831
My mom took me
to the hospital forX-rays...

549
00:41:51,942 --> 00:41:54,206
but they didn't find nothing.

550
00:41:55,579 --> 00:41:57,274
Quiet, girl.

551
00:41:57,381 --> 00:41:59,110
I'm outgoing.

552
00:42:00,084 --> 00:42:01,346
Quiet.

553
00:42:01,452 --> 00:42:04,819
I don't care.
Inside I'm outgoing.

554
00:42:06,257 --> 00:42:08,782
You started to make
some noise there.

555
00:42:10,928 --> 00:42:15,194
- Unplug these tubes and help me up.
- You can't move, Dex.

556
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:18,962
I can't stay here.

557
00:42:19,069 --> 00:42:21,037
They'll find her.

558
00:42:23,741 --> 00:42:26,005
This is your chance, Trixie.

559
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:28,510
You've gotta find Dawn first.

560
00:42:28,612 --> 00:42:30,512
No matterwhere it leads.

561
00:42:32,082 --> 00:42:33,982
Orwho it hurts.

562
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:39,720
What did he mean about a tape?

563
00:42:48,299 --> 00:42:50,961
He's just a frightened
little baby boy.

564
00:42:51,068 --> 00:42:53,036
- He's okay, Ruby.
- No, he's not.

565
00:42:53,137 --> 00:42:54,729
Let me go.

566
00:42:57,508 --> 00:43:01,137
He's still in love with her.
Isn't he?

567
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:03,907
She's gonna get him killed,
you know.

568
00:43:04,014 --> 00:43:05,811
She's the devil.

569
00:43:05,916 --> 00:43:08,976
Doyou know Dawn Sloane well enough
to be acquainted with her?

570
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:10,951
Do I know Dawn Sloane?

571
00:43:11,055 --> 00:43:14,024
First it was her,
then it was me...

572
00:43:15,125 --> 00:43:16,786
now it's you?

573
00:43:28,005 --> 00:43:31,202
Doyou know any family
that she might be related to?

574
00:43:41,685 --> 00:43:44,381
Mr. Slotnick--Jacob...

575
00:43:44,488 --> 00:43:46,979
I need to talkwith you
aboutyour sister's case...

576
00:43:47,091 --> 00:43:50,060
'cause there's a lot of uncertainty
that's not clear in my mind.

577
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,788
But could we go inside first?

578
00:43:52,896 --> 00:43:54,864
It's probably not so cold there.

579
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:03,170
Doyou live here alone
byyourself,Jacob?

580
00:44:03,273 --> 00:44:04,672
Yup.

581
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:13,206
Does your sister Dawn
ever come here?

582
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:14,875
Nope.

583
00:44:19,790 --> 00:44:21,280
Why not?

584
00:44:21,392 --> 00:44:23,417
Mostlywe'd just argue.

585
00:44:25,462 --> 00:44:28,124
You've been arguing with Dawn?

586
00:44:28,932 --> 00:44:30,365
Nope.

587
00:44:32,870 --> 00:44:35,930
- You haven't been arguing with Dawn?
- No.

588
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:40,204
- No, you haven't been arguing?
- Yes.

589
00:44:40,310 --> 00:44:42,369
- Yes.
- That's right.

590
00:44:46,917 --> 00:44:48,782
Okay, so...

591
00:44:50,254 --> 00:44:53,621
when was the last time
that you saw Dawn...

592
00:44:53,724 --> 00:44:55,555
with your own eyes?

593
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:58,719
Couple ofyears ago.

594
00:45:00,164 --> 00:45:01,358
Christmas.

595
00:45:05,669 --> 00:45:08,832
Did she ever say
that she had some trouble?

596
00:45:08,939 --> 00:45:12,136
Dorothy stays away from trouble.

597
00:45:12,242 --> 00:45:16,144
- Dorothy?
- Stays away from trouble.

598
00:45:16,246 --> 00:45:19,044
Do you have any idea where she'd go
if she had some trouble...

599
00:45:19,149 --> 00:45:20,980
and she wanted
to stay away from it?

600
00:45:21,085 --> 00:45:22,484
Nope.

601
00:45:24,121 --> 00:45:27,284
These questions
are for clues to follow.

602
00:45:28,859 --> 00:45:30,486
Ifyou don't have clues...

603
00:45:30,594 --> 00:45:33,222
the bread and butter can be cut
right out from underyour feet...

604
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:36,891
and then if anything bad happens,
there's only one person to blame...

605
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,366
and that's each other.

606
00:45:42,706 --> 00:45:44,435
She calls.

607
00:45:46,877 --> 00:45:51,337
- On the phone?
- Well, of course on the phone.

608
00:45:54,918 --> 00:45:56,545
So...

609
00:45:56,653 --> 00:46:01,716
when was the last time that she
called you on the phone around?

610
00:46:01,825 --> 00:46:03,554
This morning.

611
00:46:05,462 --> 00:46:08,124
Dawn Sloane called you
this morning?

612
00:46:08,232 --> 00:46:12,168
- Yup. On the phone.
- Well, why didn'tyou say so?

613
00:46:13,103 --> 00:46:15,230
I just did.

614
00:46:55,746 --> 00:46:59,273
- Can I helpyou?
- Who's in room 304?

615
00:46:59,383 --> 00:47:00,407
Why?

616
00:47:00,517 --> 00:47:04,715
We're old friends.
She'd be a parasite for sore eyes.

617
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:06,756
What's she look like?

618
00:47:06,857 --> 00:47:08,916
Hair that men like...

619
00:47:09,026 --> 00:47:11,324
and looks like a lymphomaniac.

620
00:47:11,428 --> 00:47:14,420
- Yeah, that's her.
- Is she alone?

621
00:47:15,532 --> 00:47:17,295
I just bring the food.

622
00:47:26,076 --> 00:47:28,067
Who is it?

623
00:47:28,178 --> 00:47:30,578
It's the person
who makes the room clean.

624
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:32,114
The maiden.

625
00:47:32,216 --> 00:47:33,911
What doyou want?

626
00:47:36,854 --> 00:47:38,822
I got towels.

627
00:47:40,858 --> 00:47:42,826
What areyou doing?

628
00:47:44,461 --> 00:47:46,190
I've seen you--

629
00:47:47,231 --> 00:47:49,358
You get out.

630
00:47:49,466 --> 00:47:52,731
How did you find me?
Nobody knows where I am.

631
00:47:54,238 --> 00:47:56,638
Bring a black pot
ofhot coffee right away.

632
00:47:56,740 --> 00:47:59,504
- We've only got silver pots.
-Just do it.

633
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:14,015
It was so sick...

634
00:48:14,124 --> 00:48:16,092
what they made me do.

635
00:48:17,728 --> 00:48:19,662
They didn't have to go that far.

636
00:48:20,898 --> 00:48:22,365
But...

637
00:48:23,767 --> 00:48:25,394
I got 'em good now.

638
00:48:25,502 --> 00:48:29,199
I'm gonna get $1 00,000 from him.

639
00:48:29,306 --> 00:48:31,797
Maybe, I don't know, 200,000.

640
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:35,868
Ifl can just get his secretary
to give him the messages.

641
00:48:37,281 --> 00:48:39,249
- What?
- We're gettin' out ofhere.

642
00:48:39,349 --> 00:48:42,079
No. No, I've got
to have a drink.

643
00:48:42,185 --> 00:48:44,278
- No.
- Please give me the bottle.

644
00:48:44,388 --> 00:48:47,357
You are not drinking yourself
into Bolivia.

645
00:48:47,457 --> 00:48:48,924
Where?

646
00:48:51,395 --> 00:48:53,488
Who areyou?

647
00:48:53,597 --> 00:48:55,087
I'm me.

648
00:48:58,835 --> 00:49:01,269
You are goofy.

649
00:49:01,371 --> 00:49:03,999
Nobody ever told you that before?

650
00:49:04,107 --> 00:49:06,371
It's not irrelevant right now.

651
00:49:08,011 --> 00:49:10,275
You're never gonna get a guy.

652
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:13,508
I mean, look.
This is what guys want, okay?

653
00:49:13,617 --> 00:49:15,517
Let's get real.

654
00:49:17,754 --> 00:49:19,915
You probably don't even like men.

655
00:49:20,023 --> 00:49:22,821
Maybe you're lucky.

656
00:49:25,162 --> 00:49:26,789
Doesn't matter.

657
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:30,490
Dex is the one.

658
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:33,034
He makes me feel special.

659
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:37,338
Okay.

660
00:49:37,441 --> 00:49:41,343
You tell Avery
the ball is in his court now.

661
00:49:44,414 --> 00:49:46,678
I'm gonna make him
a special deal.

662
00:49:49,019 --> 00:49:51,453
Fifty thousand
for the tape tonight.

663
00:49:52,456 --> 00:49:55,016
Fifty thousand's good
for both sides, right?

664
00:49:55,125 --> 00:49:58,151
A sex scandal's gotta
be worth that much, huh?

665
00:49:59,563 --> 00:50:01,758
We'll split it. You and me.

666
00:50:05,202 --> 00:50:06,829
I just--

667
00:50:06,937 --> 00:50:10,998
I want to get away--
I want to get away from everybody.

668
00:50:11,108 --> 00:50:12,905
I want to just--

669
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:16,377
I want mywhole life
to be different.

670
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:19,410
Before it's too late for me.

671
00:50:19,516 --> 00:50:21,677
Night and day

672
00:50:21,785 --> 00:50:24,015
Day and night

673
00:50:31,495 --> 00:50:33,929
I never do anything worthwhile.

674
00:50:38,268 --> 00:50:40,259
God doesn't love me anymore.

675
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:42,270
That's not true.

676
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:46,034
- Forget it.
- I can't forget it.

677
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:49,542
I'm the worst person alive.

678
00:50:49,646 --> 00:50:52,012
I make one mistake after another.

679
00:50:54,284 --> 00:50:56,047
I've ruined my career.

680
00:50:56,153 --> 00:50:59,589
Hey, nobody's human.
It's the way things are.

681
00:50:59,689 --> 00:51:01,714
All right?
Now we gotta go.

682
00:51:02,459 --> 00:51:04,051
I want to go to sleep.

683
00:51:04,161 --> 00:51:07,688
Later. Come on. Put on some shoes,
'cause I am driving you back in my car.

684
00:51:07,798 --> 00:51:10,699
No. No, no, no, they'll find me.

685
00:51:10,801 --> 00:51:14,237
I'm staying right here,
and there's nothing you can do about it.

686
00:51:14,337 --> 00:51:16,862
Dawn, your life has gone
to hell in a handbag.

687
00:51:16,973 --> 00:51:19,168
I don't care.

688
00:51:19,276 --> 00:51:22,541
You just--
You call Avery right now.

689
00:51:22,646 --> 00:51:24,204
Oryou get out!

690
00:51:25,482 --> 00:51:27,746
Room service.

691
00:51:34,324 --> 00:51:37,157
It's only four bucks, lady.

692
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:41,390
I don't wantyou letting anybody
into this room when I'm not here...

693
00:51:41,498 --> 00:51:43,693
unless I recognize them.

694
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:46,132
Or I'll beatyou up good.

695
00:51:54,311 --> 00:51:56,176
Excuse me.

696
00:51:56,279 --> 00:51:58,406
These offices are locked...

697
00:51:58,515 --> 00:52:01,416
but I need to talk to Senator Avery
so that I can speakwith him.

698
00:52:01,518 --> 00:52:04,043
The old boys usually go
to the Forum Club around now...

699
00:52:04,154 --> 00:52:07,351
up on Capitol Drive,
butyou'll need to wear a dress.

700
00:52:07,457 --> 00:52:09,425
Yeah, I figured.
Hey, thanks.

701
00:52:09,526 --> 00:52:12,324
No public servant
can take money for favors.

702
00:52:48,331 --> 00:52:51,425
- Doyou smell mothballs?
- I thought it was the dress.

703
00:52:52,536 --> 00:52:54,094
Hey, Elly May.

704
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:21,019
Senator, sir?

705
00:53:22,232 --> 00:53:24,462
Remember me, please?

706
00:53:25,502 --> 00:53:27,800
Well, now.

707
00:53:27,904 --> 00:53:30,498
I'm used to a little
scratching on the doghouse...

708
00:53:30,607 --> 00:53:32,939
before sharing the bowl here.

709
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:36,274
No, thankyou.
I'm not thirsty.

710
00:53:36,379 --> 00:53:40,577
Miss, I didn't askyou to sit down.
And I didn't hearyou ask me.

711
00:53:40,684 --> 00:53:43,482
Sorry, sir.
Can I sit down, sir?

712
00:53:46,523 --> 00:53:48,514
Sir...

713
00:53:48,625 --> 00:53:51,458
I was on Red Rafferty's boat
last weekend.

714
00:53:51,561 --> 00:53:54,257
- Is that a fact?
- Yes, sir, it's a fact.

715
00:53:54,364 --> 00:53:56,264
And it was stupid too.

716
00:53:57,734 --> 00:53:59,326
Oh, I see.

717
00:53:59,436 --> 00:54:02,997
It was a stupid fact, huh?

718
00:54:05,008 --> 00:54:06,270
Well, then...

719
00:54:06,376 --> 00:54:10,506
Iet me try and teach you
about facts.

720
00:54:10,614 --> 00:54:13,549
Especially around this place.

721
00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:18,678
It's a fact that in my district
we lose one farm every single month.

722
00:54:18,788 --> 00:54:21,689
Now that's one entire
family enterprise.

723
00:54:21,791 --> 00:54:24,589
And doyou know what that does
to me personally?

724
00:54:24,694 --> 00:54:28,027
It just breaks my heart.

725
00:54:29,833 --> 00:54:33,030
When I was a young boy,
my pop--

726
00:54:33,136 --> 00:54:34,797
The clown.

727
00:54:39,509 --> 00:54:41,636
Anyway...

728
00:54:41,745 --> 00:54:43,235
he lost his farm.

729
00:54:43,346 --> 00:54:45,473
It just ripped my guts out.

730
00:54:45,582 --> 00:54:48,983
Now that's why I support
this corporate vertical farming.

731
00:54:49,085 --> 00:54:51,349
Now, it's an unpopular idea...

732
00:54:51,454 --> 00:54:56,255
butyou have to wearyour unpopularity
as a badge ofhonor, don'tyou?

733
00:54:56,359 --> 00:54:58,384
I thinkyou do, don'tyou?
Now, look.

734
00:54:59,863 --> 00:55:03,196
You see those fellows
over there-- sitting over there?

735
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:06,633
They have no badge ofhonor.

736
00:55:06,736 --> 00:55:10,331
Those are the gutless wonders
from across the aisle.

737
00:55:12,175 --> 00:55:16,441
They preach hypocrisy
and not democracy.

738
00:55:16,546 --> 00:55:19,447
That, too, is a fact.

739
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:26,017
Don't you remember?

740
00:55:26,122 --> 00:55:28,249
Me and Red almost got
into an alteration...

741
00:55:28,358 --> 00:55:32,522
and you said that he should be more
gentlemanlike 'cause I'd tear him apart.

742
00:55:32,629 --> 00:55:35,427
Which is right, since I know
I could've kicked his ass.

743
00:55:35,532 --> 00:55:37,500
And also, I'm a girl.

744
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:38,589
Awoman.

745
00:55:38,702 --> 00:55:41,603
A woman. Oh, yes, you are indeed.

746
00:55:41,705 --> 00:55:45,801
Very, very much indeed.

747
00:55:45,909 --> 00:55:49,310
But I'm just flat-out sorry, miss.
I don't recall.

748
00:55:49,412 --> 00:55:51,642
There were just so many people
on that boat.

749
00:55:51,748 --> 00:55:54,444
Oh, no, sir. There weren't.
There was...

750
00:55:56,186 --> 00:55:59,747
one, two, three...

751
00:55:59,856 --> 00:56:03,519
four, five, six, seven.

752
00:56:03,626 --> 00:56:06,390
And then six, five...

753
00:56:06,496 --> 00:56:10,830
because number two had to drive the
little boat for number one which is me.

754
00:56:10,934 --> 00:56:13,767
So, back on the big boat
there was five again.

755
00:56:13,870 --> 00:56:16,771
Because he's still number two
on my fingers.

756
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:20,938
I seem to be missing the point.

757
00:56:22,712 --> 00:56:23,872
Senator, sir...

758
00:56:25,315 --> 00:56:27,783
it's time to swallow
the bullet.

759
00:56:29,018 --> 00:56:31,452
I know about the tape.

760
00:56:35,258 --> 00:56:36,748
The tape.

761
00:56:37,627 --> 00:56:39,925
You know about the tape.

762
00:56:44,667 --> 00:56:46,396
What tape?

763
00:56:46,503 --> 00:56:50,599
Areyou referring to
the mother of all tapes?

764
00:56:51,808 --> 00:56:54,641
People still go 'round
and 'round about that.

765
00:56:54,744 --> 00:56:58,077
I've stated on the record that Nixon's
only crime was getting caught.

766
00:56:58,181 --> 00:57:02,083
He'll still go down as
the most effective modern president.

767
00:57:02,185 --> 00:57:04,745
And he was a hell of a trapper.
Oh, boy.

768
00:57:04,854 --> 00:57:07,448
Although most people think otherwise.

769
00:57:07,557 --> 00:57:09,957
Did you ever hear about...

770
00:57:11,060 --> 00:57:14,689
this little luscious
Hong Kong tour guide?

771
00:57:17,333 --> 00:57:20,791
He kept her hid
at Bebe Rebozo's foryears.

772
00:57:22,372 --> 00:57:24,272
I'm sorry. Poop.

773
00:57:26,209 --> 00:57:29,804
This isn't whatyou came to talk
about, is it, American history?

774
00:57:29,913 --> 00:57:31,312
No, sir.

775
00:57:34,017 --> 00:57:37,214
- I want to talk about the tape.
- Oh, yeah, the tape.

776
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:40,756
Well-- Areyou sure
you're speaking to the right person?

777
00:57:40,857 --> 00:57:45,988
Senator, I respect thatyou're
a big wheel in a small pond...

778
00:57:46,095 --> 00:57:48,495
and I wouldn't botheryou
otherwise.

779
00:57:48,598 --> 00:57:51,396
But, sir, you are the right one.

780
00:57:57,774 --> 00:57:59,674
I'm running for my eighth term.

781
00:57:59,776 --> 00:58:03,507
Last elected by the largest plurality
ever in my district.

782
00:58:03,613 --> 00:58:07,014
I'm currently on nine legislative
and culture committees.

783
00:58:07,116 --> 00:58:10,017
Oh, I believe in culture.
I really do.

784
00:58:10,119 --> 00:58:12,747
But just not too much culture.

785
00:58:12,856 --> 00:58:16,986
Because too much culture just breeds
a kind ofarrogance.

786
00:58:18,261 --> 00:58:20,695
Eisenhower.

787
00:58:20,797 --> 00:58:22,765
You know Eisenhower?

788
00:58:24,033 --> 00:58:27,332
Well, he and that fashion model...

789
00:58:27,437 --> 00:58:28,961
that was just embarrassing.

790
00:58:29,072 --> 00:58:30,096
His wife knew.

791
00:58:30,206 --> 00:58:33,004
He should have stuckwith
the double-breasted WAC...

792
00:58:33,109 --> 00:58:35,407
with her own built-in foxhole.

793
00:58:52,929 --> 00:58:54,863
I find you very attractive.

794
00:58:57,066 --> 00:59:00,467
Don't askwhy.
It's just freshness.

795
00:59:02,438 --> 00:59:03,996
You're unspoiled.

796
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:09,936
I'm 52.

797
00:59:11,781 --> 00:59:13,180
Divorced.

798
00:59:17,420 --> 00:59:19,650
And a pretty fairjudge ofwomen.

799
00:59:22,792 --> 00:59:26,626
I would sayyou're
the genuine article, aren'tyou?

800
00:59:26,729 --> 00:59:29,823
Why areyou getting so nervous?
I don't bite.

801
00:59:29,933 --> 00:59:34,267
Sir, this is my first case
and I'm still green behind the ears.

802
00:59:34,370 --> 00:59:36,270
But...

803
00:59:36,372 --> 00:59:39,569
one person has already
been beaten up good...

804
00:59:39,676 --> 00:59:42,907
and another is scared
ofthe same thing, only better.

805
00:59:43,012 --> 00:59:45,378
Pretty soon somebody
could get killed here...

806
00:59:45,481 --> 00:59:47,210
and die!

807
00:59:53,423 --> 00:59:54,822
Die?

808
01:00:00,396 --> 01:00:02,489
Who the hell areyou?

809
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:05,033
And what in God's name
areyou talking about?

810
01:00:06,536 --> 01:00:10,472
My name is Trixie Zurbo.
I'm a private defective.

811
01:00:11,574 --> 01:00:12,973
You mean detective?

812
01:00:13,076 --> 01:00:15,408
Detective.

813
01:00:15,511 --> 01:00:18,776
And I'm giving 1 00% to this case.

814
01:00:18,881 --> 01:00:21,850
And what I got left, I'm giving
to help people out oftrouble...

815
01:00:21,951 --> 01:00:23,748
because ofthe tape.

816
01:00:23,853 --> 01:00:28,950
Now, I know it can't be the bad singing
tape, so it's gotta be another one.

817
01:00:29,058 --> 01:00:33,392
And I'm asking you sinceyour name
has come up and been mentioned...

818
01:00:33,496 --> 01:00:35,794
yours and Red's...

819
01:00:35,898 --> 01:00:38,992
and the DeFlore brothers
and their fists.

820
01:00:40,370 --> 01:00:42,099
I need answers, sir.

821
01:00:42,205 --> 01:00:45,538
Otherwise, it'd be like looking through
a needle for a haystack, you know?

822
01:00:45,642 --> 01:00:47,542
Sir...

823
01:00:47,644 --> 01:00:51,045
why is this tape worth
so much money from you?

824
01:00:51,147 --> 01:00:55,516
Does it involve the land deal
and those luxury pandemoniums?

825
01:00:55,618 --> 01:00:59,679
Is money the root canal
of all the evil here?

826
01:00:59,789 --> 01:01:03,953
Those are pretty serious
allegations, young lady.

827
01:01:05,294 --> 01:01:07,353
Slimy too.

828
01:01:09,699 --> 01:01:12,099
There's a big, empty grave out there...

829
01:01:12,201 --> 01:01:15,398
where all the falsely accused
politicians lie.

830
01:01:15,505 --> 01:01:17,268
You just ask Newt.

831
01:01:17,373 --> 01:01:21,867
And ifthis Red Rafferty
is abusing my good name...

832
01:01:21,978 --> 01:01:23,411
I'll have him punished.

833
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:28,041
And whateveryour involvement
is in this...

834
01:01:29,152 --> 01:01:31,052
the same goes foryou.

835
01:01:32,155 --> 01:01:35,454
You may be hearing that tape on TV.

836
01:01:35,558 --> 01:01:37,958
And then everybody
will know about it.

837
01:01:38,061 --> 01:01:40,723
It's very easy to throw grenades...

838
01:01:40,830 --> 01:01:43,264
but it's very, very hard
to catch them.

839
01:01:43,366 --> 01:01:46,267
Sir, the ball is in your camp.

840
01:01:47,537 --> 01:01:49,596
So, now, what is it?
Blackmail?

841
01:01:49,706 --> 01:01:52,675
Is that what this is,
is blackmail?

842
01:01:52,775 --> 01:01:56,609
Well, I suppose
that comes with life...

843
01:01:56,713 --> 01:01:58,772
in the old fishbowl.

844
01:02:07,390 --> 01:02:10,257
- Areyou married?
- No, sir.

845
01:02:11,661 --> 01:02:13,822
Why areyou asking me that?

846
01:02:13,930 --> 01:02:16,694
Oh, it's just that
a woman's...

847
01:02:16,799 --> 01:02:18,858
sexual temperature is...

848
01:02:19,969 --> 01:02:22,301
never lost on me.

849
01:02:24,941 --> 01:02:26,841
Gals maybe, huh?

850
01:02:28,311 --> 01:02:29,369
Threesomes?

851
01:02:31,047 --> 01:02:33,982
Team creams?

852
01:02:34,083 --> 01:02:40,147
Senator, I know life can't be easy
for people likeyou in a bowl offish.

853
01:02:40,256 --> 01:02:44,192
But I am not gonna sit back
on my hunches about this.

854
01:02:53,169 --> 01:02:54,966
I see.

855
01:02:58,775 --> 01:03:03,007
Well, I am going to say one thing
and one thing only.

856
01:03:03,112 --> 01:03:07,310
So listen carefully
and hearwhat I am saying.

857
01:03:07,416 --> 01:03:10,442
I am one ofthe few--
one ofthe very few...

858
01:03:10,553 --> 01:03:13,249
who will admit
that all politicians...

859
01:03:13,356 --> 01:03:16,450
are guilty ofsome misdemeanors.

860
01:03:16,559 --> 01:03:19,084
It's just inherent in the office.

861
01:03:19,195 --> 01:03:21,390
But we are sworn by oath...

862
01:03:21,497 --> 01:03:26,161
never to go beyond the bounds
of reasonable dishonesty.

863
01:03:26,269 --> 01:03:29,397
What kind oflame duck is that?

864
01:03:31,407 --> 01:03:35,309
Doyou hearyourselftalking
when you speak?

865
01:03:41,784 --> 01:03:44,014
You hear this.

866
01:03:45,288 --> 01:03:48,485
Nobody can influence me.

867
01:03:48,591 --> 01:03:52,049
Not power mongers
with short penises.

868
01:03:52,161 --> 01:03:55,062
Nobody! Nobody at all!

869
01:03:55,164 --> 01:03:57,325
And a woman?

870
01:03:57,433 --> 01:03:59,264
Even less.

871
01:04:00,469 --> 01:04:04,269
Now leave my table,
immediately.

872
01:04:29,665 --> 01:04:31,860
Can I have Dawn Sloane's room?

873
01:04:31,968 --> 01:04:34,766
- That line's busy.
- It's busy?

874
01:04:34,871 --> 01:04:37,704
- It can't be busy!
- Well, it is.

875
01:04:37,807 --> 01:04:39,707
Okay, okay, bye.

876
01:04:42,845 --> 01:04:44,972
Hey, easy.

877
01:04:45,081 --> 01:04:48,949
But that machine took my money
in return. And no gum.

878
01:04:49,051 --> 01:04:53,181
The service guy don't get here till 9:00
and we can't refund. Station policy.

879
01:04:53,289 --> 01:04:55,519
It's only 7:30.

880
01:04:55,625 --> 01:04:59,755
You wanna hear a good joke?
Knock, knock.

881
01:04:59,862 --> 01:05:02,422
Come in.

882
01:05:02,531 --> 01:05:04,055
Is that it?

883
01:05:05,368 --> 01:05:07,268
Where's the laboratory?

884
01:05:09,272 --> 01:05:11,604
The lavatory?
It's inside around the corner.

885
01:05:15,945 --> 01:05:17,469
It's ten bucks.

886
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:20,777
Listen to this. It's great.
Knock, knock.

887
01:05:20,883 --> 01:05:23,784
- Who's that?
- No, it's "who's there?"

888
01:05:24,987 --> 01:05:26,887
Can I help you?

889
01:06:13,936 --> 01:06:17,963
She's registered as Dorothy Slotnick
ofCrescents Cove.

890
01:06:18,074 --> 01:06:20,304
Wristwatch stopped at 7:30.

891
01:06:20,409 --> 01:06:22,400
Must've been when she jumped,
orwas pushed.

892
01:06:25,014 --> 01:06:26,879
Gravity is a bitch.

893
01:06:28,751 --> 01:06:32,448
She called her a lymphomaniac,
which I thought was rather crass.

894
01:06:32,555 --> 01:06:36,958
She told me to get her a black pot
of coffee. So I did that.

895
01:06:37,059 --> 01:06:40,426
When I came to the door, she gave me
five bucks to watch her room.

896
01:06:45,901 --> 01:06:48,369
She sounded like
a five-year-old child.

897
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:06,345
There's no Mr. Lang
in our hospital.

898
01:07:06,455 --> 01:07:08,753
He's checked out?

899
01:07:08,858 --> 01:07:11,224
He couldn't walk on his legs
to check out.

900
01:07:11,327 --> 01:07:13,659
He wasn't discharged.
He'sjust gone.

901
01:07:13,763 --> 01:07:15,663
He's escaped?

902
01:07:23,339 --> 01:07:26,308
But seriously, ifyou're
driving tonight, please--

903
01:07:26,409 --> 01:07:27,842
Don't forget your car.

904
01:07:27,943 --> 01:07:30,844
You took the words right out
of my mouth. Good night.

905
01:07:38,554 --> 01:07:41,546
Just keep bringing me these
until I can't pronounce my name.

906
01:07:45,227 --> 01:07:48,060
She was dressed like a nun
with a sexy habit.

907
01:07:48,164 --> 01:07:52,828
A habit that would make a bishop put
his fist through a stained glass window.

908
01:07:52,935 --> 01:07:56,063
- What's with the getup?
- I'm in a cognito.

909
01:07:56,172 --> 01:07:58,367
And I need to talk to Dex.

910
01:07:58,474 --> 01:08:00,669
Safer to swim with piranha.

911
01:08:00,776 --> 01:08:04,678
Ask Dawn Sloane. Poor messed-up kid.
Finally got the front page.

912
01:08:04,780 --> 01:08:06,839
Tell me ifyou've seen her.

913
01:08:06,949 --> 01:08:09,884
Not for days.
Areyou okay?

914
01:08:09,985 --> 01:08:12,715
Something's wrong.
It's bad wrong.

915
01:08:12,822 --> 01:08:15,814
Pushing a lady six floors
has rarely been considered virtuous.

916
01:08:15,925 --> 01:08:19,486
Dex didn't do it!
I know he didn't do it.

917
01:08:19,595 --> 01:08:24,294
Ifyou have thoughts you can think of,
I've moved to the Motel Embers Motel.

918
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:27,335
Trixie, old Arabian proverb:

919
01:08:27,436 --> 01:08:30,769
Trust in Allah,
but tieyour camel.

920
01:08:30,873 --> 01:08:33,774
Thanks. I don't smoke.

921
01:08:47,389 --> 01:08:49,380
How did you find out
where I lived?

922
01:08:49,492 --> 01:08:51,824
- Where's Dex?
- I don't know.

923
01:08:53,028 --> 01:08:56,327
- Where is he?
- He's not here.

924
01:09:03,806 --> 01:09:04,704
Hey, babe.

925
01:09:09,245 --> 01:09:11,770
Mommywants you back
in the bedroom.

926
01:09:11,881 --> 01:09:13,746
Can you do that?

927
01:09:21,457 --> 01:09:24,483
What else doyou
want to know, Miss Dick?

928
01:09:24,593 --> 01:09:26,493
Who the father is?

929
01:09:29,999 --> 01:09:31,432
Maybe it's Dex.

930
01:09:33,369 --> 01:09:34,927
Maybe not.

931
01:09:36,038 --> 01:09:38,404
No, you don't know
a thing about Dex...

932
01:09:38,507 --> 01:09:41,499
or me or about that bitch Dawn.

933
01:09:43,379 --> 01:09:46,644
You're no better than any of us,
not even Kirk.

934
01:09:49,718 --> 01:09:51,845
Your little pal's an ex-con.

935
01:09:53,656 --> 01:09:55,886
He murdered somebody once.

936
01:09:56,992 --> 01:09:58,550
In cold blood.

937
01:09:59,795 --> 01:10:02,889
But I fucked him anyways.
'Cause who cares?

938
01:10:06,502 --> 01:10:09,562
Why don'tyou go home
and chaseyour shadow for a while?

939
01:10:09,672 --> 01:10:12,232
You're never gonna catch that man.

940
01:10:17,012 --> 01:10:18,912
You're wrong.

941
01:10:20,749 --> 01:10:25,118
Even ifl am between a rock
and the deep blue sea...

942
01:10:25,221 --> 01:10:27,621
I am gonna fix this thing.

943
01:10:39,602 --> 01:10:41,160
It's Dex.

944
01:10:45,407 --> 01:10:47,136
You escaped?

945
01:10:47,243 --> 01:10:50,701
They made herjump.
They pushed her.

946
01:10:50,813 --> 01:10:52,303
Doyou have a gun?

947
01:10:52,414 --> 01:10:55,076
Yeah. So?

948
01:10:55,184 --> 01:10:57,948
So I'm gonna blow
their pinheads off.

949
01:11:02,691 --> 01:11:03,749
Not with that.

950
01:11:03,859 --> 01:11:07,386
Oh, I'll do it.
Don't worry.

951
01:11:07,496 --> 01:11:09,794
You should know that about me.

952
01:11:09,898 --> 01:11:12,458
Along with the other shit.

953
01:11:12,568 --> 01:11:15,901
There's no bullets. How can you shoot
somebodywithout any bullets?

954
01:11:16,005 --> 01:11:18,633
I don't care.
It's brains, not bullets anyway.

955
01:11:21,176 --> 01:11:23,007
What's that?

956
01:11:24,780 --> 01:11:26,247
For the ticker.

957
01:11:26,348 --> 01:11:30,045
Without these little babies,
it'd be "Good-bye, cruel world."

958
01:11:34,456 --> 01:11:37,823
- And now my parents are coming.
- My clues!

959
01:11:37,926 --> 01:11:39,985
Wanna take me back.

960
01:11:40,095 --> 01:11:43,758
Can you believe that? Backwhere?
To the rich life we used to lead?

961
01:11:43,866 --> 01:11:47,063
Sorry. Too old for that.

962
01:11:48,737 --> 01:11:50,830
I'm glad you're here.

963
01:11:51,940 --> 01:11:54,534
I'm glad you're okay.

964
01:11:54,643 --> 01:11:56,201
Areyou okay?

965
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:07,346
- Why are we doing this?
- Why not?

966
01:12:07,456 --> 01:12:10,687
- We don't want him to see us.
- Why not?

967
01:12:10,793 --> 01:12:13,261
Because then he'll see us.

968
01:12:13,362 --> 01:12:14,761
Good.

969
01:12:17,833 --> 01:12:20,131
Red, you in there?

970
01:12:20,235 --> 01:12:24,228
Did you maybe run or something?
How far doyou wanna take this?

971
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:26,570
- Come on.
- How far doyou wanna go?

972
01:12:26,675 --> 01:12:29,439
Come on. Listen.

973
01:12:29,545 --> 01:12:33,447
Dawn told me she hid the tape in
a secret place and didn't tell anybody.

974
01:12:33,549 --> 01:12:36,177
Areyou one ofthe people
she didn't tell?

975
01:12:38,187 --> 01:12:40,485
I know a little bit
about Dawn's secret place.

976
01:12:40,589 --> 01:12:42,147
Take me there.

977
01:13:21,630 --> 01:13:23,097
Wake up.

978
01:13:23,198 --> 01:13:25,860
Go to sleep.

979
01:13:25,968 --> 01:13:27,026
Go on stage.

980
01:13:28,737 --> 01:13:30,136
Make love.

981
01:13:44,019 --> 01:13:45,145
Clues.

982
01:14:21,190 --> 01:14:22,555
Assholes!

983
01:14:28,597 --> 01:14:30,724
Get inside. You missed!

984
01:14:33,235 --> 01:14:34,293
Assholes!

985
01:14:43,178 --> 01:14:45,112
You shot my brother.

986
01:14:48,684 --> 01:14:51,380
You shot my brother.

987
01:15:00,562 --> 01:15:03,463
Stop there right whereyou are
on your tracks.

988
01:15:24,786 --> 01:15:26,686
I hate hospitals.

989
01:15:28,023 --> 01:15:30,753
You have some nerve, young lady.
That was not our boy.

990
01:15:30,859 --> 01:15:32,349
Joe, please.

991
01:15:32,461 --> 01:15:36,488
It's all right. We remember Charlie
as healthy and happy-go-lucky.

992
01:15:36,598 --> 01:15:38,793
- That wasn't Charlie.
- Here's Dr. Gold.

993
01:15:38,901 --> 01:15:41,062
Mr. and Mrs. Lang.

994
01:15:41,169 --> 01:15:43,501
I'm sureyou're aware
your son's condition...

995
01:15:43,605 --> 01:15:46,574
is compounded by his enlarged heart.

996
01:15:46,675 --> 01:15:50,338
We drove 500 miles last night
becauseyou tell us our boy is here...

997
01:15:50,445 --> 01:15:52,310
and then you show us that.

998
01:15:52,414 --> 01:15:56,077
He's conscious. Vital signs are
stabilizing. Bullet went through him.

999
01:15:56,184 --> 01:15:59,950
But it's early. Your HMO won't cover
his preexisting conditions.

1000
01:16:00,055 --> 01:16:02,717
- God, I hate hospitals.
- Your secondary carrier is?

1001
01:16:02,824 --> 01:16:04,416
I want him out ofhere!

1002
01:16:04,526 --> 01:16:06,721
Well, I'll go to Admitting.

1003
01:16:06,828 --> 01:16:10,559
Get a few forms.
Just a mere clerical thing.

1004
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:33,454
We gotta stop meeting like this.

1005
01:16:38,927 --> 01:16:42,385
- Get me out ofhere.
- You can't leave.

1006
01:16:42,497 --> 01:16:46,126
You got more tubes than
you can shake a cat at.

1007
01:16:46,234 --> 01:16:49,226
Did you see my folks out there?

1008
01:16:49,338 --> 01:16:51,238
Not so rich, huh?

1009
01:16:53,241 --> 01:16:55,505
They got something
better than money.

1010
01:16:55,611 --> 01:16:57,306
Better than me.

1011
01:17:29,011 --> 01:17:30,911
I gotta go.

1012
01:17:34,082 --> 01:17:36,312
You gotta go all the way now.

1013
01:17:39,021 --> 01:17:42,013
We can't do it here now, can we?

1014
01:17:45,160 --> 01:17:47,060
What?

1015
01:17:47,162 --> 01:17:49,460
You halfin love with meyet?

1016
01:17:56,238 --> 01:17:59,696
Let's jump offthat bridge
when we come to it, okay?

1017
01:18:03,145 --> 01:18:04,942
The other half's better.

1018
01:18:08,016 --> 01:18:11,918
You can't be in a patient's room.
Areyou a patient?

1019
01:18:12,020 --> 01:18:14,454
- She's with me.
- I'm leaving.

1020
01:18:27,469 --> 01:18:30,563
Well, you're certainly
feeling much better.

1021
01:18:33,675 --> 01:18:35,836
I don't understand this.

1022
01:18:35,944 --> 01:18:38,640
I thought that we had
talked about this before.

1023
01:18:38,747 --> 01:18:39,771
I want my money, Red!

1024
01:18:39,881 --> 01:18:44,443
I've tried to teach you
about patience.

1025
01:18:51,059 --> 01:18:52,856
I don't believe this!

1026
01:18:52,961 --> 01:18:55,930
I thought I'd been good
toyou guys.

1027
01:18:56,031 --> 01:18:59,262
You don't know what
real work is because--

1028
01:19:01,236 --> 01:19:02,828
Is this whatyou want?

1029
01:19:02,938 --> 01:19:04,337
Take it easy. Take it easy.

1030
01:19:09,277 --> 01:19:13,839
Come on and kill me,
you stupid sons ofbitches! Please!

1031
01:19:13,949 --> 01:19:16,782
Kill me!
I don't even care!

1032
01:19:16,885 --> 01:19:18,443
Oh, God!

1033
01:19:20,188 --> 01:19:22,088
Listen, fellas.

1034
01:19:23,492 --> 01:19:25,016
I'm sorry.

1035
01:19:42,911 --> 01:19:44,469
Sons ofbitches!

1036
01:19:54,389 --> 01:19:55,947
Oh, God.

1037
01:20:05,133 --> 01:20:06,100
You?

1038
01:20:07,836 --> 01:20:09,827
What areyou doing here?

1039
01:20:12,741 --> 01:20:14,299
Oh, I see.

1040
01:20:15,410 --> 01:20:18,345
All right. I rememberyou.

1041
01:20:19,648 --> 01:20:21,639
Is this the wayyou want it?

1042
01:20:26,922 --> 01:20:29,049
What is wrong with you?

1043
01:20:29,157 --> 01:20:32,092
You killed Dawn Sloane, didn'tyou?

1044
01:20:35,997 --> 01:20:38,465
Areyou kidding me?

1045
01:20:38,567 --> 01:20:40,967
How dareyou.

1046
01:20:47,776 --> 01:20:50,438
I don't have time foryou.
Goddamn it! Leave me alone.

1047
01:20:50,545 --> 01:20:53,776
Did you push heryourself
orwatch your pin cushions do it?

1048
01:20:56,084 --> 01:20:57,847
I loved Dawn!

1049
01:21:00,655 --> 01:21:04,557
Okay, maybe it wasn't love.
But it was something.

1050
01:21:06,127 --> 01:21:08,652
What areyou doing?
What doyou want from me?

1051
01:21:08,763 --> 01:21:12,529
She's dead now.
She's never gonna be the same again.

1052
01:21:13,902 --> 01:21:17,736
Nobody everwanted anybody
the way I wanted Dawn.

1053
01:21:21,309 --> 01:21:23,675
Oh, God, it's bad now.

1054
01:21:25,113 --> 01:21:28,048
Everything is bad now.

1055
01:21:28,149 --> 01:21:30,777
It's a bad world we live in.

1056
01:21:33,755 --> 01:21:35,188
You did it.

1057
01:21:35,290 --> 01:21:38,418
Butyou're gonna make
a 1 00-degree turn and confess.

1058
01:21:38,526 --> 01:21:40,050
Confess to what?

1059
01:21:40,161 --> 01:21:41,594
I loved her!

1060
01:21:42,898 --> 01:21:45,059
The very best I knew how.

1061
01:21:45,166 --> 01:21:47,964
Why doesn't anybody understand
these things? They take time.

1062
01:21:48,069 --> 01:21:50,867
I even told mywife about her,
for God's sake!

1063
01:21:50,972 --> 01:21:54,772
- That doesn't mean you didn't do it.
- I didn't kill Dawn.

1064
01:21:54,876 --> 01:21:58,573
You think I'd be lying now?
I came up here to join her. This is it.

1065
01:22:02,717 --> 01:22:03,741
Hang on.

1066
01:22:03,852 --> 01:22:05,843
Don't let go. Notyet.

1067
01:22:05,954 --> 01:22:09,185
Wait a minute.
I'm not readyyet.

1068
01:22:09,291 --> 01:22:11,191
Listen. She knew it was just business.

1069
01:22:11,293 --> 01:22:13,693
I don't use women like that.
Just this once.

1070
01:22:13,795 --> 01:22:17,026
All right, well, maybe
just that one other time.

1071
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:21,858
I swear, I'm not like Avery.
I never killed anybody.

1072
01:22:25,206 --> 01:22:26,901
Oh, God. Oh, God.

1073
01:22:27,008 --> 01:22:28,873
Wait. Where areyou going?
Listen.

1074
01:22:28,977 --> 01:22:31,537
Just give me a hand here.
Wait a minute.

1075
01:22:31,646 --> 01:22:34,206
I'm not safeyet.
I loved her.

1076
01:22:34,916 --> 01:22:36,144
I loved her!

1077
01:22:36,251 --> 01:22:38,742
Goddamn it! I loved her!

1078
01:22:46,127 --> 01:22:48,755
That's why I'm tellin'ya

1079
01:22:48,863 --> 01:22:51,024
I'm gonna getyou

1080
01:22:51,132 --> 01:22:52,724
Andgetyou, getyou

1081
01:22:52,834 --> 01:22:54,802
Shut up, Dawn.

1082
01:22:54,903 --> 01:22:57,201
Something inyour loving

1083
01:22:57,305 --> 01:22:59,671
Makes everything all right

1084
01:23:00,575 --> 01:23:02,634
Wow.

1085
01:23:02,744 --> 01:23:04,735
How do you sing Acapulco like that?

1086
01:23:08,483 --> 01:23:10,951
Good foryou.

1087
01:23:11,052 --> 01:23:13,987
Keep our humor going
during these dark moments.

1088
01:23:20,462 --> 01:23:22,453
What's the matter?

1089
01:23:23,164 --> 01:23:25,064
I just wanna get going.

1090
01:23:25,166 --> 01:23:26,997
All in good time.

1091
01:23:27,102 --> 01:23:30,003
You can take myword
on matters of patience.

1092
01:23:31,172 --> 01:23:33,402
You do trust me, don'tyou?

1093
01:23:34,943 --> 01:23:36,672
I assume that means yes.

1094
01:23:36,778 --> 01:23:40,509
Yeah. I mean, you can use
your own discrepancy on that.

1095
01:23:41,616 --> 01:23:44,278
All right.
What aren'tyou saying?

1096
01:23:50,358 --> 01:23:52,588
Did you really go to jail?

1097
01:23:55,964 --> 01:23:58,398
Oh, I see.

1098
01:23:58,500 --> 01:24:00,559
Soyou wanna get going
away from me.

1099
01:24:00,668 --> 01:24:02,898
- No.
- That's whatyou're thinking.

1100
01:24:03,004 --> 01:24:05,234
I don't have to believe
what I think.

1101
01:24:07,308 --> 01:24:10,209
Seven years, minimum time.

1102
01:24:11,346 --> 01:24:13,473
Astoundingly good behavior.

1103
01:24:15,216 --> 01:24:17,116
Best reviews of my life.

1104
01:24:17,218 --> 01:24:19,379
Better than when I opened
forTrini Lopez.

1105
01:24:19,487 --> 01:24:21,387
Butyou killed somebody dead.

1106
01:24:21,489 --> 01:24:24,754
- Murder.
- I didn't murder anyone.

1107
01:24:26,728 --> 01:24:30,630
I did, however,
slaughter a man...

1108
01:24:30,732 --> 01:24:32,632
in my own defense.

1109
01:24:34,302 --> 01:24:37,294
I am not by nature...

1110
01:24:37,405 --> 01:24:39,430
an offensive person.

1111
01:24:46,114 --> 01:24:47,741
I know.

1112
01:24:48,583 --> 01:24:50,881
I meantyou no harm, Miss Trix.

1113
01:25:01,496 --> 01:25:04,056
Lucy, you can't be in the show.

1114
01:25:04,866 --> 01:25:07,426
Oh, why, Ricky?

1115
01:25:13,041 --> 01:25:17,375
Just turn the big old lights
on little old me and let me loose.

1116
01:25:20,815 --> 01:25:23,375
Like a real star.

1117
01:25:23,485 --> 01:25:25,646
Right?

1118
01:25:25,753 --> 01:25:28,984
Yeah. You look like a star.

1119
01:25:30,425 --> 01:25:32,825
Dress like that tomorrow.
In full regatta.

1120
01:25:55,250 --> 01:25:56,842
It's me.

1121
01:26:03,091 --> 01:26:05,491
Areyou all right?

1122
01:26:07,362 --> 01:26:09,626
Does the pain really hurt?

1123
01:26:09,731 --> 01:26:13,360
My old man hates hospitals
as much as much as I do.

1124
01:26:13,468 --> 01:26:16,301
I'm going homewith them,
try and get healed.

1125
01:26:19,040 --> 01:26:20,598
You're going home?

1126
01:26:23,044 --> 01:26:24,841
Soyou're okaythen?

1127
01:26:25,547 --> 01:26:27,606
Can you comewith me?

1128
01:26:31,719 --> 01:26:35,450
Averywould just make out
like a banshee then.

1129
01:26:35,557 --> 01:26:38,355
I got a good plan. Honest.

1130
01:26:38,459 --> 01:26:41,860
- I can't go back to square zero.
- Oh, shit.

1131
01:26:41,963 --> 01:26:44,761
Maybeyou still need a doctor.

1132
01:26:44,866 --> 01:26:47,198
No, I need something else.

1133
01:26:49,704 --> 01:26:52,935
Please don't ask me to quit.
Please don't.

1134
01:26:55,476 --> 01:26:59,207
I'm proud ofyou.
Quiet girl bucking the odds.

1135
01:27:00,915 --> 01:27:03,076
Except I can't helpyou now.

1136
01:27:03,818 --> 01:27:06,048
You did help me.

1137
01:27:06,154 --> 01:27:08,281
- Did I?
- Yeah.

1138
01:27:08,389 --> 01:27:10,949
Not like I could on a good day.

1139
01:27:14,762 --> 01:27:16,195
Look at them.

1140
01:27:16,297 --> 01:27:19,198
Standing there in spite
of everything.

1141
01:27:20,301 --> 01:27:22,633
Can't buy that, can you?

1142
01:27:22,737 --> 01:27:25,968
See, I'm rich after all.
You too.

1143
01:27:26,074 --> 01:27:28,599
So bet big for both of us.

1144
01:27:28,710 --> 01:27:31,804
The less you bet
the more you lose when you win.

1145
01:27:31,913 --> 01:27:33,471
I know that.

1146
01:27:35,516 --> 01:27:36,676
I will.

1147
01:27:36,784 --> 01:27:39,344
We got a long way to go, son.

1148
01:27:42,557 --> 01:27:44,457
Got a long way to go.

1149
01:27:47,362 --> 01:27:48,795
Beatrice.

1150
01:28:01,976 --> 01:28:03,375
Good-bye.

1151
01:28:07,649 --> 01:28:10,049
It's just for now, though, okay?

1152
01:28:11,386 --> 01:28:13,377
It's not the real good-bye.

1153
01:28:15,290 --> 01:28:17,383
What's real, Beatrice?

1154
01:29:28,563 --> 01:29:31,691
- I got to pee-pee real bad.
- Not in my caryou're not.

1155
01:29:31,799 --> 01:29:34,529
Oh, easy foryou to say.

1156
01:29:34,635 --> 01:29:36,193
It hurts.

1157
01:29:38,005 --> 01:29:39,905
I hate stakeouts.

1158
01:29:44,746 --> 01:29:47,044
What ifhe didn't do it?

1159
01:29:50,017 --> 01:29:53,077
What areyou talking about?
Of course he did it.

1160
01:29:53,187 --> 01:29:56,987
Besides, he's guilty ofso much shit,
whatever comes to him he deserves.

1161
01:29:59,127 --> 01:30:01,391
You know what they say about lies.

1162
01:30:01,496 --> 01:30:05,455
A lie gets halfway around the world
before truth can get its pants on.

1163
01:30:07,435 --> 01:30:09,266
There he is. That's him.

1164
01:30:09,370 --> 01:30:11,133
Where?

1165
01:30:11,239 --> 01:30:13,298
You didn't tell me he was cute.

1166
01:30:16,377 --> 01:30:17,935
Knuckleheads.

1167
01:30:19,547 --> 01:30:20,946
Ifwe win, we win.

1168
01:30:21,048 --> 01:30:24,108
Ifwe lose,
we spare ourselves untold agony.

1169
01:30:55,216 --> 01:30:57,844
Leave it here, will you?
How's thatyoung wife?

1170
01:30:57,952 --> 01:30:58,884
Fine, sir.

1171
01:31:01,122 --> 01:31:03,420
- Takeyourjacket off.
- What aboutyours?

1172
01:31:03,524 --> 01:31:05,151
I'm saving mine for later.

1173
01:31:05,259 --> 01:31:07,989
Hey, Al, ifyou wanna
avoid a train wreck on this thing...

1174
01:31:08,095 --> 01:31:09,790
call us in to conference.

1175
01:31:09,897 --> 01:31:13,060
Ifyou don't, when I get a chance
to wreck that train, I'll wreck it.

1176
01:31:13,167 --> 01:31:14,191
Bullshit.

1177
01:31:14,302 --> 01:31:17,328
When you get tired
ofbeing stupid, we'll talk.

1178
01:31:17,438 --> 01:31:20,339
- Walk in halfmoons.
- Halfmoons.

1179
01:31:20,441 --> 01:31:23,467
Keepyour shoulders back
and sparkle, peanut.

1180
01:31:24,278 --> 01:31:25,836
Good. Own it.

1181
01:31:29,283 --> 01:31:32,218
And pose. You look great.

1182
01:31:32,320 --> 01:31:34,515
Own it.

1183
01:31:34,622 --> 01:31:36,283
Okay, dazzle them.

1184
01:31:45,399 --> 01:31:47,924
We stole it fair and square, Bob.

1185
01:31:48,035 --> 01:31:50,299
Al's really spooked.

1186
01:31:50,404 --> 01:31:52,770
He's got a cob up his ass.

1187
01:31:53,574 --> 01:31:55,235
There he is.

1188
01:31:56,177 --> 01:31:57,371
Hello.

1189
01:31:57,478 --> 01:32:00,140
I wouldn't piss down
his throat...

1190
01:32:01,516 --> 01:32:03,984
ifhis heart was on fire.

1191
01:32:04,085 --> 01:32:08,818
I gotta pee-pee really bad. Would you
order me a peach daiquiri, frozen?

1192
01:32:08,923 --> 01:32:11,357
Honey, where's the ladies' lounge?

1193
01:32:11,459 --> 01:32:13,950
-Just around the corner, miss.
- Thankyou.

1194
01:32:14,061 --> 01:32:16,859
Could I have a peach potpourri?

1195
01:32:16,964 --> 01:32:18,192
I'll try.

1196
01:32:18,299 --> 01:32:20,358
Tell the guys we did a good job.

1197
01:32:20,468 --> 01:32:21,992
I'll do that, Drummond.

1198
01:32:26,340 --> 01:32:28,900
Don't make me hurtyou.

1199
01:32:29,010 --> 01:32:30,204
Let go!

1200
01:32:46,327 --> 01:32:48,261
Come back here! Shit!

1201
01:33:49,323 --> 01:33:50,881
Mister, you okay?

1202
01:33:55,129 --> 01:33:56,596
Damn it!

1203
01:33:56,697 --> 01:33:58,892
Watch the language
you use around me!

1204
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:02,367
- Doyou know whatyou're messing with?
- Get in the trunk in back.

1205
01:34:02,470 --> 01:34:04,495
Come on.
Don'tyou know the score?

1206
01:34:04,605 --> 01:34:07,403
- Yeah, two-zip to me. Do it.
- Very cute.

1207
01:34:07,508 --> 01:34:10,671
I'll lose my damn job.

1208
01:34:10,778 --> 01:34:13,941
I'll tell you what else.
I'm not paying for this car.

1209
01:34:14,048 --> 01:34:18,576
I'm a government employee.
I work for a state senator.

1210
01:34:21,255 --> 01:34:23,155
What's up?

1211
01:34:23,257 --> 01:34:25,452
Can I have the bag, please?

1212
01:34:25,559 --> 01:34:26,992
Give me the fuckin' bag!

1213
01:34:30,264 --> 01:34:33,722
Okay, bend your legs and knees,
all ofyou, over there.

1214
01:34:35,236 --> 01:34:38,034
Wait. Get naked
out ofyour clothes.

1215
01:34:38,139 --> 01:34:41,040
- What?
- Do it. Naked. Take them off.

1216
01:34:45,479 --> 01:34:47,845
Kiss your lips to the ground.

1217
01:34:47,948 --> 01:34:48,915
Do it!

1218
01:34:50,418 --> 01:34:53,353
- Now sayyou're sorry.
- Sorry.

1219
01:35:11,105 --> 01:35:13,903
- Where have you been?
- Don't even ask.

1220
01:35:14,008 --> 01:35:15,270
You're out ofbreath.

1221
01:35:15,376 --> 01:35:17,674
Okay, let's do it.

1222
01:35:17,778 --> 01:35:19,370
- Now?
- Yeah.

1223
01:35:24,151 --> 01:35:26,779
I mean, snowmobiling
is a very big business.

1224
01:35:26,854 --> 01:35:31,120
Now, we've put together this pamphlet
thatyou can look at in your own time.

1225
01:35:31,225 --> 01:35:34,319
Mother Nature is sometimes
a neglectful mother...

1226
01:35:34,428 --> 01:35:38,524
as it were, and doesn't always
provide for her children.

1227
01:35:38,632 --> 01:35:42,329
And it's snowmobiles
that help create the tracks--

1228
01:35:48,576 --> 01:35:50,305
This table is reserved
for senators.

1229
01:35:50,411 --> 01:35:52,174
Senator Avery, sir?

1230
01:35:52,279 --> 01:35:55,680
Theyoung lady can join us,
ifyou would like.

1231
01:35:55,783 --> 01:35:57,648
- How kind.
- You're lovely. Thankyou.

1232
01:35:57,752 --> 01:36:00,186
Well, come on over.
You people don't mind?

1233
01:36:00,287 --> 01:36:02,949
No, not at all.
That's fine.

1234
01:36:05,793 --> 01:36:09,285
- There we go.
-James, get my coat.

1235
01:36:09,396 --> 01:36:10,727
There we are.

1236
01:36:21,075 --> 01:36:23,771
I'm Ruby.
What's your name?

1237
01:36:23,878 --> 01:36:26,176
Drummond.

1238
01:36:26,280 --> 01:36:27,406
Senator Drummond.

1239
01:36:27,515 --> 01:36:31,246
They love it.
The tracks make tracks for nature.

1240
01:36:31,352 --> 01:36:34,446
- What wereyou saying?
- Wild animals love snowmobiling.

1241
01:36:34,555 --> 01:36:37,080
The truth about snowmobiling.

1242
01:36:37,191 --> 01:36:40,126
You folks seem just
ready for a slam dunk.

1243
01:36:41,595 --> 01:36:45,622
Can't just let nature run wild,
can we, young lady?

1244
01:36:55,743 --> 01:36:59,144
Yes, well, that's really
quite something.

1245
01:36:59,246 --> 01:37:02,647
I hadn't thought ofit that way.

1246
01:37:02,750 --> 01:37:05,480
It's-- You know--

1247
01:37:05,586 --> 01:37:08,646
Well, you know,
some of my colleagues...

1248
01:37:08,756 --> 01:37:13,659
theywould toss you to the alligators
just to watch them peel that...

1249
01:37:15,529 --> 01:37:17,429
whole salami.

1250
01:37:19,800 --> 01:37:25,170
I'm sorry. It gets hotter than high
school love in some ofthese sessions.

1251
01:37:26,307 --> 01:37:29,299
You know, even
Rough RiderTeddy, he had--

1252
01:37:29,410 --> 01:37:31,901
he had a condom named after him.

1253
01:37:42,556 --> 01:37:44,581
Oh, I tell you...

1254
01:37:44,692 --> 01:37:49,356
sometimes after a session
all you can do--

1255
01:37:49,463 --> 01:37:51,590
all you can really say is...

1256
01:37:51,699 --> 01:37:53,428
"Wham, bam, thankyou, ma'am."

1257
01:37:53,534 --> 01:37:55,058
You're welcome.

1258
01:37:55,169 --> 01:37:57,296
We realize it's gonna take
a concentrated effort.

1259
01:38:01,575 --> 01:38:03,975
We're so glad that
you're on board with us, Senator.

1260
01:38:14,655 --> 01:38:16,714
Another round, Senator?

1261
01:38:16,824 --> 01:38:19,759
Yes. Round and firm.

1262
01:38:19,860 --> 01:38:25,389
Silly me. I completely forgot to
give them my I D at the bar.

1263
01:38:25,499 --> 01:38:27,467
You don't have to do that.

1264
01:38:27,568 --> 01:38:28,762
Sixteen?

1265
01:38:30,738 --> 01:38:34,367
- Let me see that. I'll handle this.
- Very good, sir.

1266
01:38:34,475 --> 01:38:37,501
I suppose I probably
shouldn't have any drinks then.

1267
01:38:44,051 --> 01:38:45,848
Who the hell areyou?

1268
01:38:53,661 --> 01:38:56,425
Well, it seems like this young lady
is trying to get me...

1269
01:38:56,530 --> 01:38:59,795
to leave the table
with my head between my knees.

1270
01:38:59,900 --> 01:39:03,802
Verywell, Senator.
We'll be in touch with your office.

1271
01:39:12,046 --> 01:39:17,382
This is a devastating situation
ifyou're on the wrong side.

1272
01:39:17,851 --> 01:39:20,046
Senator Avery, Mr. Ladies Man.

1273
01:39:20,154 --> 01:39:22,247
Where's the videotape?

1274
01:39:22,356 --> 01:39:24,381
Wouldn'tyou like to know?

1275
01:39:24,491 --> 01:39:26,482
You're blackmailing me,
you little whore!

1276
01:39:26,593 --> 01:39:29,255
Lady, what are you doi ng?
Leave the stereo alone.

1277
01:39:29,363 --> 01:39:32,059
Put your hands down.
Shut up, comprende?

1278
01:39:32,166 --> 01:39:34,396
I want my money, Avery!

1279
01:39:34,501 --> 01:39:37,402
After whatyou made me do,
I want plenty!

1280
01:39:37,504 --> 01:39:40,268
I'm not sure I know what this is.

1281
01:39:40,374 --> 01:39:45,334
I'm throwingyou out the goddamn window
ifyou don't give me that tape!

1282
01:39:45,446 --> 01:39:48,415
That would make you
a murderer, Senator.

1283
01:39:48,515 --> 01:39:53,509
No two-dollar whore
is gonna ruin my career, slut!

1284
01:39:59,193 --> 01:40:00,592
Thanks.

1285
01:40:03,530 --> 01:40:05,828
- What have we got here?
- You.

1286
01:40:08,836 --> 01:40:11,566
You are disgusting!
A disgusting pig!

1287
01:40:11,672 --> 01:40:13,162
You're a rotten mackerel!

1288
01:40:13,273 --> 01:40:16,003
- Disgusting!
- Shut up! Get her out ofhere!

1289
01:40:16,110 --> 01:40:18,772
- Help me! He's insane!
- She's underage! Get her out!

1290
01:40:18,879 --> 01:40:20,813
What's on that recording?

1291
01:40:20,914 --> 01:40:22,939
Seems like somebody's
trying to convince--

1292
01:40:23,050 --> 01:40:26,451
- Not out the front. Out the back.
- He's the killer!

1293
01:40:26,553 --> 01:40:30,114
He's the killer!
He's the fuckin' killer!

1294
01:40:30,224 --> 01:40:32,658
He killed Dawn Sloane the singer.

1295
01:40:39,066 --> 01:40:41,933
Senator, what areyou listening to?

1296
01:40:43,037 --> 01:40:45,267
So this is that tape.

1297
01:40:47,207 --> 01:40:50,643
You did it. Get her!

1298
01:40:51,745 --> 01:40:53,372
Get her! There she is!

1299
01:41:03,057 --> 01:41:05,116
Oh, shit.

1300
01:41:12,933 --> 01:41:15,333
What's the matterwith you,
huh, boy?

1301
01:41:17,704 --> 01:41:20,195
Get out of myway!

1302
01:41:21,341 --> 01:41:23,605
That's it! I quit.

1303
01:41:30,184 --> 01:41:31,344
Get out of myway!

1304
01:41:35,923 --> 01:41:37,720
Senator, can you tell us
what's going on?

1305
01:41:37,825 --> 01:41:40,055
Sure I can tell you what's going on.

1306
01:41:40,160 --> 01:41:44,426
Certain people are only at peace when
they're causing war on other people.

1307
01:41:44,531 --> 01:41:48,934
They come out here with airs
up theiryou-know-whats...

1308
01:41:49,036 --> 01:41:54,531
and they have no respect whatsoever
for the finest climate under the sun.

1309
01:41:54,641 --> 01:41:56,199
Excuse me, folks.

1310
01:41:56,310 --> 01:41:57,937
- But, Senator--
- Now, wait. Wait.

1311
01:41:58,045 --> 01:42:03,506
Now you folks put 'em on the news and
they claim the climate's ruined them.

1312
01:42:03,617 --> 01:42:06,745
I would be ashamed
to haveyourjob.

1313
01:42:06,854 --> 01:42:08,754
You're two-faced.

1314
01:42:12,292 --> 01:42:15,159
Senator,just one question--
just one question about the tape.

1315
01:42:15,262 --> 01:42:18,163
Doyou wanna make a statement
about what just happened?

1316
01:42:18,265 --> 01:42:20,495
What's your position on it?

1317
01:42:22,402 --> 01:42:24,495
The truth is...

1318
01:42:24,605 --> 01:42:28,371
in terms of size and shape...

1319
01:42:28,475 --> 01:42:29,965
and direction...

1320
01:42:30,077 --> 01:42:32,409
we're all normal men.

1321
01:42:32,513 --> 01:42:35,209
And one word sums up...

1322
01:42:35,315 --> 01:42:38,250
the responsibility of each of us.

1323
01:42:39,353 --> 01:42:42,811
And that one word is...

1324
01:42:42,923 --> 01:42:44,891
"to be prepared."

1325
01:42:44,992 --> 01:42:47,586
Everybody out!

1326
01:42:47,694 --> 01:42:50,663
Come on. Let's go.
Clear it out.

1327
01:42:50,764 --> 01:42:51,890
Move!

1328
01:42:51,999 --> 01:42:54,126
Clear it out, people.

1329
01:42:57,271 --> 01:43:01,207
nothing was ever achieved
by perfect people...

1330
01:43:01,308 --> 01:43:03,868
because you can't find 'em anywhere!

1331
01:43:05,946 --> 01:43:10,542
For Christ's sake, FDRwas poking
his secretary for 30 years!

1332
01:43:10,651 --> 01:43:13,142
And what happened?
Did the world fall apart? No.

1333
01:43:13,253 --> 01:43:15,881
Did the bottom drop out? No.
Nothing happened.

1334
01:43:15,989 --> 01:43:18,287
Nothing changed.

1335
01:43:18,392 --> 01:43:22,488
But the critics, those little
demented bastard bag ladies...

1336
01:43:22,596 --> 01:43:24,359
they keep digging it up.

1337
01:43:24,464 --> 01:43:29,663
They are the ones that would be
enormously improved by death.

1338
01:43:30,704 --> 01:43:32,934
Maybe we should hang 'em all.

1339
01:43:40,614 --> 01:43:44,880
Your comments are a little vague.
What exactly areyou admitting to, sir?

1340
01:43:44,985 --> 01:43:46,577
After my pop died--

1341
01:43:46,687 --> 01:43:50,214
Well, you folks know that story.
I've told it toyou before.

1342
01:43:50,324 --> 01:43:54,226
But I was raised by my grandmother
and some of my aunts.

1343
01:43:54,328 --> 01:43:56,228
And they shaped my life.

1344
01:43:57,631 --> 01:44:01,431
They convinced me,
as a young boy...

1345
01:44:01,535 --> 01:44:05,494
that there was always
a cookie available.

1346
01:44:05,606 --> 01:44:10,566
And even today, deep down,
I'm that little four-year-old.

1347
01:44:10,677 --> 01:44:15,080
And when I wake up, the first thought
I have is, "Where's the cookie?"

1348
01:44:16,049 --> 01:44:18,415
And that means...

1349
01:44:18,518 --> 01:44:20,918
when you go to the cupboard...

1350
01:44:21,021 --> 01:44:22,852
and there's no cookie...

1351
01:44:22,956 --> 01:44:25,982
I don't say,
"Geez, there's no cookie."

1352
01:44:27,728 --> 01:44:30,094
I say...

1353
01:44:30,197 --> 01:44:32,757
" I wonderwhere the cookie is."

1354
01:44:36,069 --> 01:44:39,698
Ifyou people are gonna
tear down monuments...

1355
01:44:39,806 --> 01:44:42,366
at least save the pedestals.

1356
01:44:42,476 --> 01:44:46,412
Because they come in
very handy later on.

1357
01:44:46,513 --> 01:44:49,482
You know, I feel like
I've been raped byyou people.

1358
01:44:49,583 --> 01:44:52,518
I think this rape's
just gone on long enough.

1359
01:44:52,619 --> 01:44:56,316
Eddie, get 'em offthe street.
News hour's over.

1360
01:44:56,423 --> 01:44:58,391
Oh,Jesus.

1361
01:44:58,492 --> 01:45:01,620
Let's clear the area.
There'll be no more questions.

1362
01:45:01,728 --> 01:45:05,061
Isn't life just a big bag
oftricks these days?

1363
01:45:32,492 --> 01:45:35,154
Go ahead. I'm ready.

1364
01:45:36,163 --> 01:45:37,960
You sure?

1365
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:41,558
I'm ready.

1366
01:45:41,668 --> 01:45:45,126
All right.
Maybe it's the beginning.

1367
01:45:48,075 --> 01:45:50,305
Or maybe it's the end.

1368
01:45:50,410 --> 01:45:51,934
I don't know.

1369
01:45:55,115 --> 01:45:58,107
Let's do it.
Come on.

1370
01:45:58,218 --> 01:46:00,209
Pull that thing.

1371
01:46:00,320 --> 01:46:02,515
Come on. Pull it.
For me!

1372
01:46:11,398 --> 01:46:12,365
Senator?

1373
01:46:14,768 --> 01:46:17,760
It's brains, not bullets.

1374
01:46:46,266 --> 01:46:49,463
Vote for the Sadomasochistic Party!

1375
01:46:51,538 --> 01:46:54,996
Vote for the Get Ahead and Die Party!

1376
01:47:09,156 --> 01:47:10,714
Come here.

1377
01:47:12,225 --> 01:47:16,184
I had that weasel in the palm of my hand
and you just threw it out the window.

1378
01:47:17,564 --> 01:47:20,897
I don't understand. I had to crawl
down a fire escape to get here.

1379
01:47:21,001 --> 01:47:23,993
I've got bruises covering
mywhole entire body.

1380
01:47:24,104 --> 01:47:28,370
How could you concoct a plan
and muck up the entire thing?

1381
01:47:28,475 --> 01:47:30,602
You should probably take up
a deskjob.

1382
01:47:30,710 --> 01:47:31,870
What?

1383
01:47:34,881 --> 01:47:37,611
Where did you get that earring?

1384
01:47:37,717 --> 01:47:39,617
The store.

1385
01:47:43,056 --> 01:47:44,819
Where's the other one?

1386
01:47:44,925 --> 01:47:47,689
I'm losing my earrings
all the time. I don't know.

1387
01:47:47,794 --> 01:47:52,959
You should be a lot more concerned
about Avery than my goddamn earrings.

1388
01:47:55,302 --> 01:47:57,202
It's you, isn't it?

1389
01:48:12,052 --> 01:48:15,044
You just ruined another life...

1390
01:48:15,155 --> 01:48:17,248
Miss Dick.

1391
01:48:18,425 --> 01:48:20,620
This time, your own.

1392
01:48:27,033 --> 01:48:28,967
Did you push her?

1393
01:48:32,272 --> 01:48:35,173
How could you not even
think aboutyour baby?

1394
01:48:37,844 --> 01:48:40,506
How dareyou mention my baby!

1395
01:48:40,614 --> 01:48:43,105
How dareyou mention him!

1396
01:48:43,216 --> 01:48:47,414
You don't know anything about me.
You don't know anything!

1397
01:48:47,521 --> 01:48:49,512
You killed her now!

1398
01:48:51,024 --> 01:48:55,654
You're going down, baby!
The killer is you now!

1399
01:48:55,762 --> 01:48:58,287
The killer's over there!
She did it!

1400
01:48:58,398 --> 01:49:00,866
The killer's right there!

1401
01:49:00,967 --> 01:49:04,266
It's her! She's in disguise
in the white coat!

1402
01:49:04,371 --> 01:49:05,565
Hold that woman!

1403
01:50:33,426 --> 01:50:37,123
I booked Ruby Pearli on a foot chase.
Then I saw a female, kind oftall.

1404
01:50:37,230 --> 01:50:39,494
Excuse me, sir.

1405
01:50:39,599 --> 01:50:41,897
There she is. That's her.

1406
01:50:42,002 --> 01:50:44,436
Who areyou and
what doyou know about this?

1407
01:50:44,537 --> 01:50:48,166
Look, the crutch ofthe matter is...

1408
01:50:48,274 --> 01:50:52,040
you get that earring
from Ruby Pearli's ear.

1409
01:50:52,145 --> 01:50:53,806
Ruby Pearli, right.

1410
01:50:53,913 --> 01:50:58,247
Match it to the same one
you found at the crime scenery...

1411
01:50:58,351 --> 01:51:01,980
maybe even test iffor D and A...

1412
01:51:02,088 --> 01:51:05,455
and you'll have clues
coming out ofthe wormwood.

1413
01:51:05,558 --> 01:51:07,458
The wormwood?

1414
01:51:07,560 --> 01:51:10,290
Ruby Pearli killed Dawn Sloane...

1415
01:51:10,397 --> 01:51:13,662
because she was jealous
over Dex and his love.

1416
01:51:13,767 --> 01:51:15,325
Dex who?

1417
01:51:16,603 --> 01:51:19,629
I might know how she feels...

1418
01:51:19,739 --> 01:51:22,173
but I would never show it
that way.

1419
01:51:23,610 --> 01:51:25,840
It wouldn't be love anymore...

1420
01:51:25,945 --> 01:51:28,607
not the way that I wanna love.

1421
01:51:28,715 --> 01:51:32,242
Lady, what the hell
are you talking about?

1422
01:51:32,352 --> 01:51:35,253
I'm telling you the truth...

1423
01:51:35,355 --> 01:51:38,290
the whole and the truth...

1424
01:51:38,391 --> 01:51:40,859
and nothing but the truth.
