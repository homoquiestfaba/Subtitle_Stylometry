00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:16,266
HISTORY'S PHANTOM

2
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:18,810
KEIO PERIOD YEAR FOUR (1868)
EDO CASTLE

3
00:00:18,893 --> 00:00:22,647
TALKS BETWEEN KATSU KAISHU
AND SAIGO TAKAMORI BREAK DOWN

4
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:25,650
THE NEW GOVERNMENT ARMY LED BY SAIGO
BESIEGED YOSHINOBU TOKUGAWA

5
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:31,114
<i>I'm going to tell you a story about light.</i>

6
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:40,165
Fire!

7
00:00:41,082 --> 00:00:42,208
Charge!

8
00:00:44,502 --> 00:00:45,545
Fire!

9
00:01:00,351 --> 00:01:01,436
<i>Where this was,</i>

10
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:04,105
<i>the darkness lasted for a long time,</i>

11
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:07,984
<i>and you could not even be sure
where your body was.</i>

12
00:01:11,529 --> 00:01:14,783
<i>Everyone was resigned to the fact</i>

13
00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:17,452
<i>that the world would be trapped
in darkness forever</i>

14
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:20,413
<i>and would not stop fighting.</i>

15
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:31,174
Vykwarus.

16
00:01:56,074 --> 00:02:00,203
<i>And yet everyone, and more than anyone,</i>

17
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:03,373
<i>I was waiting and hoping for the light.</i>

18
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:09,462
<i>The light illuminated the world,
revealing everything.</i>

19
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:16,094
<i>It shone on this beautiful, ugly,
lovable, spiteful world,</i>

20
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:22,934
<i>and my own little foolish self.</i>

21
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:22,243
A FEW YEARS LATER
KYOTO

22
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:26,831
<i>The old era melted into the darkness,</i>

23
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:31,085
<i>and the new era
was shining in the dazzling light.</i>

24
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:37,550
<i>Old things disappeared rapidly,</i>

25
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:41,387
<i>and things that the world
had never seen before started to appear.</i>

26
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:47,518
<i>People called it the Meiji Restoration.</i>

27
00:03:49,854 --> 00:03:51,731
- Our dear guest will leave now.
- Okay!

28
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:54,400
- Hurry and clean up!
<i>- </i>Take it there.

29
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:57,904
- Please!
- Take this there, will you?

30
00:03:57,987 --> 00:04:01,532
Take care, sir. We look forward
to having you back soon.

31
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:09,916
Let go!

32
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:11,584
Let me go!

33
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:13,628
Be a good girl!

34
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:16,256
Stay still, you little... Don't make me...

35
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:18,258
What's this?

36
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:20,134
You want me to take this?

37
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:23,304
Just give her a bath
and throw a kimono on her.

38
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:24,931
She'll look completely different.

39
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:28,518
Look! She's an elf,
and a fine specimen at that.

40
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:32,230
She certainly is a novelty.

41
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:36,651
You don't come with strings attached,
do you?

42
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:41,614
Heavens, no! She's an orphan
with no strings attached.

43
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:42,907
Man, that hurts!

44
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:48,413
Let go of me, jerk!

45
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:50,039
What's with her?

46
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:51,457
She's just like a wildcat.

47
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:54,127
Let go!

48
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:56,129
Throw her in a cage in the basement.

49
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:57,212
Yes, sir.

50
00:04:58,047 --> 00:04:59,841
- Stop it!
- Hey, guard.

51
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:06,931
It's got water inside. Throw that on her
if she gets out of control.

52
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:09,642
- Water?
- Yep.

53
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:12,603
She almost drowned on the boat
coming here.

54
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:15,148
She hates getting wet
for some weird reason.

55
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:18,693
No hard feelings.

56
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:21,946
If you behave yourself,
you should be let out soon.

57
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:25,825
Don't act like you're helping me!
Let me out now!

58
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:43,801
Make yourself at home.

59
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:49,307
Hey! I'm telling you
to get me out of here!

60
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:51,309
What did I tell you? Be a good girl.

61
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:52,392
Look!

62
00:05:57,231 --> 00:06:00,610
Just because she's an elf,
don't try to screw me over...

63
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:01,819
Why would I do that?

64
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:05,823
- This is the Great Asahiro, you know.
- What's so great about it?

65
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:08,451
Top government officials flock here.

66
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:11,537
In other words,
this is the brothel of their choice.

67
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:15,500
Plus, this is also the residence
of the most beautiful woman in Kyoto.

68
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:18,336
It is said that guests become
so comfortable, they forget to return.

69
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:20,647
This reputation granted her the nickname
"The Forgetful."

70
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:23,591
You have in your possession
the Great Courtesan Chihaya.

71
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:28,638
Hey, Izou!

72
00:06:29,138 --> 00:06:31,099
I hear the newcomer is a gem.

73
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:32,558
Gem? Far from it.

74
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:34,936
Hey, careful!

75
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:36,020
A gourd?

76
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:44,028
FUYO

77
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:45,113
High Courtesan.

78
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:47,114
Are you awake?

79
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:54,372
I'm coming in.

80
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:00,836
High Courtesan.

81
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:03,840
Oh, it's you, Izou.

82
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:07,718
I brought you a rare treat.

83
00:07:09,053 --> 00:07:10,430
Leave it there.

84
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:17,812
I also brought you what you asked for.

85
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:20,773
An English textbook?

86
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:29,532
Thank you, Izou.

87
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:40,918
Look at you.
You must have broken her heart.

88
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:42,002
This?

89
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:44,422
Well...

90
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:46,632
That tomboy must have scratched me.

91
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:48,134
Tomboy?

92
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:52,513
A real wild one has arrived.

93
00:07:58,311 --> 00:07:59,311
Hey, wake up.

94
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:06,194
You are an elf, aren't you?

95
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:09,155
- So what?
- Don't dare speak to her like that.

96
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:12,241
She is the one I mentioned.
She just came...

97
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:13,325
I was sold!

98
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:20,082
She just came here,
but she thrashed around,

99
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,626
trying to run away.

100
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:27,715
Hey. Are you forgetting
to greet the High Courtesan?

101
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:28,798
Why should I?

102
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:32,136
I'm just going be bossed around,

103
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:34,764
chewed up, and thrown out.

104
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:37,767
Isn't that what you're planning?

105
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:42,730
She talks, all right.

106
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:44,981
Izou.

107
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:48,945
Please give her to me.

108
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:52,532
Sorry? What do you mean?

109
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:55,243
She shall be my personal attendant.

110
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:17,974
What's your name?

111
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:19,975
Sonya.

112
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:22,812
Sounds Russian.

113
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:27,567
Your family may have come from the north.

114
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,403
So did hers.

115
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,655
She's a northern bird.

116
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:35,324
A bird in a cage?

117
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:38,536
You're no different from that!

118
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:44,584
I like rebellious girls.

119
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:42,141
Having trouble sleeping?

120
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:45,936
If you're still awake, come here.

121
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:01,702
What are you doing?

122
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:03,578
Studying.

123
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:14,882
Everyone calls me "Chihaya the Forgetful."

124
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:17,885
But my clients aren't the ones who forgot.

125
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,763
I did.

126
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:26,477
I hear it was soon after the Restoration

127
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:29,188
that I had forgotten everything.

128
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:31,232
I was all naked and out of it.

129
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:41,075
I possessed nothing

130
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:45,162
but this <i>kanzashi</i> hair pin.
I didn't even remember my own name.

131
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:49,542
I am Chihaya,

132
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:52,001
the Forgetful.

133
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:04,056
You know something, Sonya?

134
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:09,437
There is a land of elves
somewhere in the world.

135
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:13,232
Somewhere to the north, beyond the seas.

136
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:14,817
Land of elves?

137
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:16,359
Yes.

138
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:19,655
They call it Hakodate.

139
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:20,739
Hakodate?

140
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:27,580
There, elves are neither envied
nor feared simply for being elves.

141
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:30,249
Everyone lives there as they are,
so I hear.

142
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:36,838
You're lying!

143
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:40,049
Maybe.

144
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:43,804
But I can see it.

145
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:46,056
The dazzling light.

146
00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:49,602
That light will guide me.

147
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:51,729
I believe that.

148
00:12:58,027 --> 00:12:59,111
How about you?

149
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:02,782
You can see it too, can't you?

150
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:05,951
The light

151
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:07,787
and darkness.

152
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:11,290
ASAHIRO

153
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:23,010
Hey!

154
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:25,513
Open the door! We've got a problem!

155
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:28,307
- What?
- It's about your whores!

156
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:33,437
What about them?

157
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:46,492
It's a raid! Someone help!

158
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:33,873
Izou.

159
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:31,472
Raiden!

160
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:34,141
You have a good nose.

161
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:37,227
Find the elf I am seeking.

162
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:42,107
This is your final mission.

163
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:45,110
I keep my promises.

164
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:49,782
In exchange, I expect you
to fulfill your mission.

165
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:02,251
What's going on?

166
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:12,096
Stay in here.

167
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:19,687
This is bad! It's a raid!
There must be more than 20 of them!

168
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:21,772
We've got to get out of here! Let's go!

169
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:27,444
We can escape from here.

170
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:28,946
Wait. What about the others?

171
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:31,240
Forget about them.
We need to save ourselves.

172
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:52,218
High Courtesan...

173
00:17:38,348 --> 00:17:41,560
I expected nothing less from an orc.
You're strong like an animal.

174
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:44,730
You shall die!

175
00:17:55,699 --> 00:17:58,827
I've always come close to dying,
but never actually do.

176
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,204
What?

177
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,721
We can exit from here.

178
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:21,934
Chihaya!

179
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:37,616
Sonya!

180
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:40,244
I'm sorry! Stay with me!

181
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:41,453
Chihaya?

182
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,872
Look what we have here.

183
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:46,166
You are...

184
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:50,170
the great beauty of the Post-Restoration.

185
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:53,340
The courtesan Chihaya, aren't you?

186
00:18:53,423 --> 00:18:54,800
Get out, you thug!

187
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:56,802
Isn't this a surprise?

188
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:59,972
You talk like a common whore.

189
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:02,474
Asahiro is history.

190
00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:08,981
We can do whatever we want to you guys...

191
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:11,692
You brat!

192
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:16,155
Look what I found. An elf brat.

193
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:19,741
I'll take her.

194
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:20,868
Stop!

195
00:19:39,636 --> 00:19:41,096
You...

196
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,098
What do you think you're doing?

197
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:52,316
You whore!

198
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:55,694
How dare you!

199
00:20:05,078 --> 00:20:06,163
Chihaya!

200
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:08,957
This mission
has cost me an arm, all right.

201
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,041
No.

202
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:15,380
It can't be!

203
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:19,801
Sonya.

204
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:26,225
Bring this to...

205
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:29,853
Hakodate.

206
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:39,947
Vykwarus.

207
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:46,744
Boss!

208
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:48,205
She's in here!

209
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:50,082
Go get that monster!

210
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:51,165
Yes, sir!

211
00:21:47,764 --> 00:21:48,764
Sonya.

212
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:52,769
So her name is Sonya.

213
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:57,316
Move an inch and you're dead.

214
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:11,204
Let's get out of here!

215
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:14,499
You orcs don't feel the heat?

216
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:16,251
Just hurry up and go!

217
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:30,348
Hurry up!

218
00:22:33,935 --> 00:22:34,936
Let's go!

219
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:01,170
Sonya.

220
00:23:01,963 --> 00:23:03,632
You elves don't have this custom?

221
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:08,428
This is how we see the dead off to Heaven.

222
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:12,599
Chihaya is not going to a place like that.

223
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:14,851
She's going north.

224
00:23:15,977 --> 00:23:18,021
The courtesan's hairpin.

225
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:23,902
Chihaya wanted to go to the land of elves.
A placed called Hakodate.

226
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:27,531
Hakodate is the land of elves?

227
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:35,914
I will hire you with this.

228
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:39,793
You're asking me to take you there?

229
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:41,711
You can't say no.

230
00:23:44,297 --> 00:23:48,135
Hey girl, would you like to hire me?

231
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:52,889
- You filthy hit man.
- Hear me out.

232
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:57,644
My boss was after that girl.

233
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:02,441
He kidnaps every orphaned elf he finds.

234
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:06,153
If he finds out that she is alive,

235
00:24:06,903 --> 00:24:09,489
he will hunt her
to the ends of this world.

236
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:13,410
I see. This is how easily
you betray your allies...

237
00:24:13,493 --> 00:24:15,203
I'm not betraying.

238
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:20,709
This was my final mission.

239
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:26,089
He promised to set me free
once I finished it.

240
00:24:28,049 --> 00:24:31,595
I don't owe anyone anything anymore.

241
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:36,641
I don't want to be...

242
00:24:38,768 --> 00:24:40,353
a hit man anymore.

243
00:24:42,939 --> 00:24:44,191
I've had enough!!

244
00:24:57,078 --> 00:25:00,373
This fang is a symbol of my vow.

245
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:16,556
Do you know how to go to Hakodate?

246
00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:19,351
Of course.

247
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:28,234
Got it.

248
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:31,029
- You're hired!
- Wait a sec.

249
00:25:31,112 --> 00:25:33,156
Thank you, little girl.

250
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,240
You bet!

251
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:40,622
A Daurian redstart?
That is a good omen to start our journey.

252
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:44,459
It is said that their call
sounds like lighting a spark.

253
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:46,169
Look.

254
00:25:47,754 --> 00:25:50,632
Before we take off, we use these

255
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:55,178
and make sparks to wish for safety, right?

256
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:56,304
No.

257
00:25:57,639 --> 00:25:59,516
Elves don't do that?

258
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:03,478
I haven't introduced myself.

259
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:07,065
I am Raiden. You?

260
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:14,655
He is Izou.

261
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:22,455
YOKOHAMA

262
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:42,559
A pillar of light?

263
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:57,741
I don't care what it takes.

264
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,035
Go get her.

265
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:04,372
FUCHU-SHUKU, TOKAIDO

266
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:07,834
We do not allow orcs to stay at our lodge.

267
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:12,422
- Why?
- Ma'am, we apologize for troubling you.

268
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:14,924
Let's go look for another place.

269
00:27:22,849 --> 00:27:26,436
I'll ask you to leave right away
if you cause any trouble.

270
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:30,023
Understood. We are just grateful
to find shelter from the elements.

271
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:49,334
You are the first orc I've met
who shows proper manners.

272
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:56,383
For a human, you fall short of them.

273
00:27:59,135 --> 00:28:00,387
Let's go already!

274
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:03,223
Take it easy. I'm going.

275
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:14,275
You really have a soft spot for them.

276
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:15,944
Children, that is.

277
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:19,030
That would be elves.

278
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:21,574
I owe them.

279
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:24,828
Care to find out?

280
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:27,622
Keep it short.

281
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:31,918
It was before I came to this land.

282
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:36,923
We orcs are also considered a nuisance
in that land.

283
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:40,927
But one girl

284
00:28:41,594 --> 00:28:44,639
actually called me by my name.

285
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:47,726
Was she an elf?

286
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:48,809
Yeah.

287
00:28:49,644 --> 00:28:52,188
She reminds me of that young girl.

288
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:59,154
When she held the courtesan
and glared at me with rage,

289
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:01,406
I remembered that girl.

290
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:08,455
I left that land

291
00:29:08,538 --> 00:29:11,833
because I hated those people
who disliked and mocked orcs.

292
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:17,630
But even after coming to this land,
I'm facing the same thing.

293
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:20,257
That's not it.

294
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:24,179
I bring it on myself.

295
00:29:25,972 --> 00:29:28,850
Is that enough of a reason
to turn your back on your boss?

296
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:31,394
When all is said and done,

297
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:34,814
our race is only useful for our strength.

298
00:29:37,317 --> 00:29:42,614
We only get jobs where we kill
or get killed. Such a simple task.

299
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:50,955
We struggle blindly in the dark muck
day after day.

300
00:29:53,249 --> 00:29:56,461
Is it so wrong to seek

301
00:29:57,504 --> 00:29:58,963
the faintest sliver of light?

302
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:03,510
I found it.

303
00:30:05,178 --> 00:30:07,263
The faintest sliver of light.

304
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:16,481
You are quite skilled with the sword.
You are no stranger to battle.

305
00:30:17,857 --> 00:30:20,360
How did you end up as a guard
at a brothel?

306
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:25,698
I told you.

307
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:28,618
I failed to die.

308
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:32,914
And now I'm on borrowed time.

309
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:35,416
The Restoration?

310
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:44,384
Want a drink?

311
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:49,973
Even orcs have a drink or two.

312
00:30:50,056 --> 00:30:52,392
SAKE

313
00:30:54,769 --> 00:30:55,812
Come on!

314
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:00,608
What's the matter, Izou?

315
00:31:02,151 --> 00:31:03,319
Nothing.

316
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:07,532
Adults have a lot on their minds.

317
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:08,615
A lot?

318
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:10,326
A lot.

319
00:31:11,494 --> 00:31:12,787
That's not fair!

320
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:15,373
Tell me what "a lot" is!

321
00:31:16,499 --> 00:31:20,086
Once you grow up,
you'll figure that out all on your own.

322
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:26,467
Don't treat me like a little kid!
I hate that!

323
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:27,551
Hey.

324
00:31:28,469 --> 00:31:30,388
Be quiet.

325
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:43,359
There will be more people as we head down.

326
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:46,321
Shouldn't we take a side path?

327
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:49,198
What's the matter?

328
00:31:50,658 --> 00:31:52,076
Maybe it's my smell.

329
00:31:53,536 --> 00:31:55,622
Orcs can smell one another.

330
00:31:57,332 --> 00:31:58,332
Let's go.

331
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:05,316
Let's hope this keeps them off our tracks.

332
00:33:06,442 --> 00:33:07,442
Wait.

333
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:13,157
Who are we trying to keep off our tracks?

334
00:33:16,953 --> 00:33:21,165
Is my single fang not enough for you?

335
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:24,335
Isn't it common sense
that betrayal first requires trust?

336
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:25,586
Maybe for you.

337
00:33:26,295 --> 00:33:27,630
I trust him!

338
00:33:27,714 --> 00:33:29,757
You won't be able to go
to the land of the elves!

339
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:31,300
Chihaya taught me this.

340
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:35,346
You can trust someone if you see a light.

341
00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:38,557
Light?

342
00:33:54,657 --> 00:33:56,075
I'll take the front.

343
00:34:17,847 --> 00:34:19,348
Put that thing away.

344
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:28,398
This way.

345
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:41,120
Stay on your guard!

346
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:42,246
I know that!

347
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:02,642
Master Koketsu...

348
00:35:03,893 --> 00:35:04,894
Why?

349
00:35:05,853 --> 00:35:07,146
What...

350
00:35:09,065 --> 00:35:11,150
were you looking at?

351
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:15,196
There is nothing

352
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:19,117
that you can do anymore.

353
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:32,421
Stay with Sonya!

354
00:35:33,923 --> 00:35:35,007
Raiden!

355
00:35:36,175 --> 00:35:37,343
Stop!

356
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:42,265
Boss...

357
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:46,060
What's the matter, Raiden?

358
00:35:46,602 --> 00:35:48,312
Have you lost your mind?

359
00:35:50,022 --> 00:35:51,774
I've had enough.

360
00:35:52,525 --> 00:35:54,277
Set me free.

361
00:35:57,905 --> 00:35:59,157
As you wish.

362
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,908
We made a promise.

363
00:36:02,702 --> 00:36:06,038
If you hand that brat over, that is.

364
00:36:07,206 --> 00:36:08,624
Don't listen to him!

365
00:36:13,754 --> 00:36:17,550
In the end, you are just one of us.

366
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:19,177
Who besides us

367
00:36:20,219 --> 00:36:22,972
would accept someone like you?

368
00:36:23,806 --> 00:36:26,100
You rotten and hideous

369
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:28,227
orc.

370
00:36:31,939 --> 00:36:33,649
Don't you dare!

371
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:35,610
Kill him!

372
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:28,119
We're jumping in!

373
00:37:28,162 --> 00:37:29,914
No way! I'm scared!

374
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,375
Izou!

375
00:37:40,883 --> 00:37:43,386
There's no way
they would survive such a deep fall.

376
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:09,161
I rarely get guests.

377
00:38:49,785 --> 00:38:50,786
Raiden.

378
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:53,080
Are you all right?

379
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:05,676
Sonya is missing.

380
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:17,063
Is this the first time
you've seen a centaur?

381
00:39:18,147 --> 00:39:19,148
Who are you?

382
00:39:19,732 --> 00:39:20,858
Who knows?

383
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:23,318
Here.

384
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:33,371
People call me Tsukuyomi.

385
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:35,998
Just call me whatever you want.

386
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,543
I've heard about him.

387
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:44,298
A hermit living at the foot of Mount Fuji.

388
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:47,718
The half-man, half-horse sage.

389
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:49,929
I am no sage.

390
00:39:50,012 --> 00:39:52,556
If anything, I am a fool.

391
00:39:58,145 --> 00:40:02,400
A young woman should have drifted
over here with us in the river.

392
00:40:03,692 --> 00:40:05,945
No. I only found you two.

393
00:40:06,028 --> 00:40:08,364
- Don't lie!
- Calm down.

394
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:12,326
If he was after her,

395
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:15,204
why would he save us?

396
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:18,249
I cannot trust any freaks!

397
00:40:22,169 --> 00:40:23,504
Don't forget...

398
00:40:25,798 --> 00:40:27,174
that she is an elf, too.

399
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:32,430
Are you two looking for an elf?

400
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:34,098
Do you know anything?

401
00:40:34,181 --> 00:40:35,808
Don't get ahead of yourself.

402
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:38,811
Follow me.

403
00:41:03,544 --> 00:41:05,713
<i>Whole creation.</i>

404
00:41:06,505 --> 00:41:09,341
Have you ever heard the name

405
00:41:10,759 --> 00:41:12,887
of the Dark Lord,
the master of all things?

406
00:41:14,972 --> 00:41:17,224
No, never. This is the first time.

407
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:18,308
Is that so?

408
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:23,481
The Dark Lord is currently
in a long sleep.

409
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:26,942
Waking him requires

410
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:28,651
the Wand.

411
00:41:29,695 --> 00:41:33,199
A magic staff is needed.

412
00:41:35,367 --> 00:41:36,410
We are certain

413
00:41:37,411 --> 00:41:40,372
that this object is

414
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:42,875
in these lands.

415
00:41:44,835 --> 00:41:46,587
What is your evidence?

416
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:50,883
The bloodless coup d'etat.

417
00:41:54,553 --> 00:42:00,059
The Wand ended an intense civil war
that divided these lands in a flash.

418
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:04,146
Thanks to its power.

419
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:07,358
Don't you agree?

420
00:42:09,568 --> 00:42:11,695
Baron Okubo Toshimichi.

421
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:18,327
<i>The Wand holds an unfathomable power.</i>

422
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:21,372
If a man cloaked in light wields it,

423
00:42:21,455 --> 00:42:24,583
the world shall be brightly lit.

424
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:27,711
But if a man cloaked in darkness
brandishes it,

425
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:30,506
the world shall be covered in deep black.

426
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:37,471
Those who can use the Wand
are called "Brights."

427
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:39,055
Brights?

428
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:40,474
Correct.

429
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:45,437
How is this Wand thing

430
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:49,775
and the Brights
related to our young lady?

431
00:42:49,858 --> 00:42:53,028
Because the number of Brights is finite.

432
00:42:53,779 --> 00:42:56,240
Most of them are...

433
00:42:57,408 --> 00:42:59,159
elves, you see.

434
00:43:00,494 --> 00:43:03,581
Surely not all elves can use the Wand.

435
00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:06,041
They just may.

436
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:12,965
No one knows who a Bright may be
until one touches the Wand.

437
00:43:15,884 --> 00:43:17,803
In other words,

438
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:22,683
my boss was searching for an elf
that can use the Wand.

439
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:25,352
Did he not tell you anything?

440
00:43:26,312 --> 00:43:31,317
His underlings are just shock troops
for raids. He would not tell us anything.

441
00:43:32,234 --> 00:43:34,111
What is the reason for him

442
00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:38,866
to go as far as burning down Asahiro
to find a Bright?

443
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:45,789
There are two groups at odds
over control of the Wand and the Bright.

444
00:43:46,665 --> 00:43:49,960
One group is called the Shield of Light.

445
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:54,506
The other is called the Inferni.

446
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:59,345
If we happen to find the Wand,

447
00:44:00,846 --> 00:44:03,515
what are we supposed to do with it?

448
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:04,599
Nothing.

449
00:44:05,225 --> 00:44:07,936
Do nothing. Say nothing.

450
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:10,856
Leave it all up to us Inferni.

451
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:16,320
If you find the Wand,
we shall lend you its power.

452
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:25,120
In our country, we have a saying
that a good deal is only offered

453
00:44:25,704 --> 00:44:26,955
for ulterior motives.

454
00:44:38,384 --> 00:44:40,260
Those pale-colored eyes.

455
00:44:42,054 --> 00:44:44,390
I cannot read emotion in them at all.

456
00:44:47,768 --> 00:44:50,479
<i>He lacks any emotion to begin with.</i>

457
00:45:05,786 --> 00:45:07,079
Are you awake?

458
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:18,173
Izou! Raiden!

459
00:45:33,188 --> 00:45:37,025
The pillar of light
that appeared in Kyoto,

460
00:45:38,152 --> 00:45:41,363
did you create that?

461
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:44,491
Power is power.

462
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:50,414
Will it manifest as heaven or hell?

463
00:45:50,497 --> 00:45:52,249
That is not predetermined.

464
00:45:53,542 --> 00:45:55,878
If you wish to learn about elves,

465
00:45:56,712 --> 00:45:59,798
travel east from Fuji.

466
00:46:01,717 --> 00:46:04,219
There is a community of elves in Yokohama.

467
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:07,848
Why are you helping us this much?

468
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:13,687
I have lived a long time.

469
00:46:15,397 --> 00:46:17,566
Long enough to be bored by this world.

470
00:46:19,234 --> 00:46:23,947
A world ruled by the shogun
or a world that installed an emperor

471
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:27,242
cannot move my heart.

472
00:46:29,286 --> 00:46:30,286
However,

473
00:46:31,747 --> 00:46:35,793
if there is yet another new world
waiting beyond this,

474
00:46:38,921 --> 00:46:40,964
I want to see it.

475
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:42,716
A new

476
00:46:43,675 --> 00:46:44,675
world?

477
00:46:45,844 --> 00:46:47,930
What do you see?

478
00:46:58,607 --> 00:47:00,776
I can read it in the stars

479
00:47:00,859 --> 00:47:04,404
that the young elf girl
should still be alive.

480
00:47:04,905 --> 00:47:05,948
Really?

481
00:47:06,031 --> 00:47:07,031
You bet.

482
00:47:08,408 --> 00:47:10,202
Have a safe trip.

483
00:47:17,042 --> 00:47:21,338
ODAWARA, TOKAIDO

484
00:47:29,596 --> 00:47:32,099
Humans and Orcs.

485
00:47:33,392 --> 00:47:35,853
Elves, dwarfs, goblins.

486
00:47:37,062 --> 00:47:38,981
I can smell many races.

487
00:47:39,064 --> 00:47:40,899
Orcs have good noses, huh?

488
00:47:41,441 --> 00:47:43,193
And good taste.

489
00:47:43,277 --> 00:47:44,653
Oh, I forgot.

490
00:47:48,365 --> 00:47:51,034
I don't know anything about you.

491
00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:53,495
Are you going to Yokohama

492
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:57,082
because you are worried about Sonya
like me?

493
00:48:03,338 --> 00:48:04,673
She did hire me.

494
00:48:05,966 --> 00:48:07,968
I'm her bodyguard.

495
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:10,971
Pulled about by loyalty

496
00:48:11,638 --> 00:48:13,765
and hounded by distrust.

497
00:48:14,516 --> 00:48:16,560
You are quite the busy samurai.

498
00:48:24,067 --> 00:48:28,030
What will you do when this is finished?
You have nothing to go back to, right?

499
00:48:28,530 --> 00:48:29,530
That is true.

500
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:32,910
I've lost everything with my right eye.

501
00:48:32,993 --> 00:48:35,203
That's not what I meant.

502
00:48:47,299 --> 00:48:49,885
Hey, little boy. Stop crying.

503
00:48:59,311 --> 00:49:00,938
You can have this instead.

504
00:49:02,397 --> 00:49:04,149
Oh, thank you!

505
00:49:04,232 --> 00:49:05,609
There he is!

506
00:49:08,153 --> 00:49:10,030
Let that boy go!

507
00:49:10,113 --> 00:49:12,240
- Kotaro!
- Mommy!

508
00:49:12,324 --> 00:49:14,284
Hey, get back here now!

509
00:49:14,368 --> 00:49:16,453
- It'll kill you!
- Knock it off.

510
00:49:17,245 --> 00:49:18,914
We are just travelers.

511
00:49:19,456 --> 00:49:21,708
- We've done nothing wrong.
- Like we believe you!

512
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:25,837
Outsiders like you two must be responsible
for snatching and killing women and kids!

513
00:49:25,921 --> 00:49:29,174
You guys must be behind
that elf killing the other day, right?

514
00:49:29,257 --> 00:49:31,677
- What did you say?
- Wait.

515
00:49:32,386 --> 00:49:35,138
These two are not bad men.

516
00:49:41,353 --> 00:49:42,980
I apologize.

517
00:49:45,315 --> 00:49:48,443
I will explain to them
what really happened.

518
00:49:50,487 --> 00:49:53,782
There have been
so many frightening stories lately.

519
00:49:54,366 --> 00:49:56,410
Everyone is on edge.

520
00:49:57,577 --> 00:49:59,579
Tell me about the elf killing.

521
00:50:01,623 --> 00:50:04,835
Many elves and humans with elf blood

522
00:50:05,419 --> 00:50:07,254
have been snatched lately.

523
00:50:08,213 --> 00:50:10,882
It was in the newspaper. Give me a second.

524
00:50:14,136 --> 00:50:17,389
There was a report just the other day

525
00:50:17,472 --> 00:50:21,393
that the corpse of an elf
was found near Yokohama Port.

526
00:50:21,977 --> 00:50:24,354
I don't know how to read.

527
00:50:30,610 --> 00:50:33,071
It was a female elf around 18 years old.

528
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:36,950
Both of her feet had been severed.

529
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:42,497
So that she couldn't run away, right?

530
00:50:43,123 --> 00:50:46,043
YOKOHAMA

531
00:50:48,962 --> 00:50:51,715
So many people in this town.

532
00:50:51,798 --> 00:50:53,925
Is there a festival going on?

533
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:58,013
First, why don't we go to the elf town
and gather information?

534
00:51:10,525 --> 00:51:12,319
What are you dawdling around for?

535
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:14,320
Unbelievable.

536
00:51:14,362 --> 00:51:16,531
Everyone is in such a rush.

537
00:51:17,949 --> 00:51:19,076
And rude, too.

538
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:22,119
What's the matter?

539
00:51:24,122 --> 00:51:26,416
No, nothing.

540
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:46,895
Why end this?

541
00:51:49,314 --> 00:51:50,315
We are

542
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:53,610
seeking the new world

543
00:51:54,569 --> 00:51:56,655
that you will lead us to, Master.

544
00:51:57,614 --> 00:51:59,658
I always liked that about you.

545
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:02,994
You are earnest like that.

546
00:52:04,246 --> 00:52:05,330
However,

547
00:52:07,415 --> 00:52:10,377
I don't need you anymore.

548
00:52:39,406 --> 00:52:40,615
Are you all right?

549
00:52:44,327 --> 00:52:48,415
You get some rest for now.
I'll go ahead for you.

550
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:13,063
High Courtesan!

551
00:53:16,234 --> 00:53:17,234
Who are you?

552
00:53:21,615 --> 00:53:22,615
My apologies.

553
00:53:23,992 --> 00:53:25,243
You are not her.

554
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:29,079
Wait!

555
00:53:31,333 --> 00:53:33,293
You mistook me for someone else, right?

556
00:53:35,337 --> 00:53:36,379
Yes.

557
00:53:39,299 --> 00:53:41,384
She may be my twin sister.

558
00:53:41,468 --> 00:53:42,469
Here.

559
00:53:43,553 --> 00:53:44,553
Go on now.

560
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:51,019
The smell of elves is too thick
everywhere I turn.

561
00:53:52,479 --> 00:53:55,440
I won't be able to sniff out
the smell of Sonya like this.

562
00:54:03,907 --> 00:54:04,950
Stop right there!

563
00:54:05,575 --> 00:54:08,370
What the? Hey, stop that!

564
00:54:08,453 --> 00:54:09,955
What are you trying to do?

565
00:54:10,038 --> 00:54:11,873
Where did you get this?

566
00:54:11,957 --> 00:54:14,793
I bought them all from one of the estates
in the Yamanote area.

567
00:54:14,876 --> 00:54:16,670
Which estate?

568
00:54:16,753 --> 00:54:19,089
I don't remember
every little detail like that!

569
00:54:22,926 --> 00:54:25,845
Hey! You need to pay for that, jerk!

570
00:54:32,185 --> 00:54:34,104
Chihaya the Forgetful?

571
00:54:34,187 --> 00:54:35,730
That was her nickname.

572
00:54:37,023 --> 00:54:40,193
She seemed to have lost
all of her memories.

573
00:54:45,365 --> 00:54:46,825
Does this look familiar?

574
00:54:48,618 --> 00:54:49,953
It's a memento from her.

575
00:54:55,834 --> 00:54:56,835
The Wand!

576
00:55:02,215 --> 00:55:07,304
Did you hear that a pillar of light
appeared in Kyoto recently?

577
00:55:07,804 --> 00:55:08,805
Asahiro.

578
00:55:10,974 --> 00:55:14,185
It shot up to the skies
from the courtesan's room.

579
00:55:21,484 --> 00:55:22,527
It was my sister.

580
00:55:25,613 --> 00:55:26,613
That was

581
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:28,950
the power of the Wand.

582
00:55:29,034 --> 00:55:31,870
Izou! I found it!

583
00:55:34,164 --> 00:55:35,373
That's Sonya's clothing!

584
00:55:37,417 --> 00:55:38,626
This is my travel buddy.

585
00:55:39,419 --> 00:55:41,046
Is she a ghost?

586
00:55:41,129 --> 00:55:42,297
She's not.

587
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:43,965
She is her twin sister.

588
00:55:44,049 --> 00:55:45,675
I just met her here.

589
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:49,262
- I see.
- Now tell me about that clothing!

590
00:55:50,472 --> 00:55:54,517
A goblin selling used clothes
bought it from an estate in the mountains.

591
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:58,438
I could smell elves
on all other clothing he had, too.

592
00:55:59,105 --> 00:56:03,109
Sonya may be trapped in that estate.

593
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:04,903
Good guess!

594
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:07,906
An estate in the mountains?

595
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:10,283
Does it ring a bell?

596
00:56:11,368 --> 00:56:13,286
Who is this Sonya?

597
00:56:13,787 --> 00:56:15,038
A young elf girl.

598
00:56:15,955 --> 00:56:17,791
She was the courtesan's favorite.

599
00:56:17,874 --> 00:56:21,211
We were supposed to take her
up to Hakodate,

600
00:56:21,753 --> 00:56:23,546
but she was kidnapped on the way.

601
00:56:25,715 --> 00:56:29,344
The people who kidnapped her
have to be the Inferni.

602
00:56:29,844 --> 00:56:31,721
Tsukuyomi spoke about them!

603
00:56:33,932 --> 00:56:37,477
It appears we are going after
the same enemy.

604
00:56:38,978 --> 00:56:41,815
Are you a member of the Shield of Light?

605
00:56:42,315 --> 00:56:43,315
I am.

606
00:56:46,653 --> 00:56:47,653
Let's go.

607
00:56:48,154 --> 00:56:50,281
I will fill you in on the details
as we go.

608
00:56:53,993 --> 00:56:56,830
My sister was a Wand wielder.

609
00:56:56,913 --> 00:56:58,289
- A Bright?
- Yes.

610
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:00,291
<i>The Shield of Light</i>

611
00:57:00,375 --> 00:57:03,420
<i>learned that the Wand was located
somewhere in Edo Castle</i>

612
00:57:03,503 --> 00:57:05,463
<i>and left for Tokyo from Hakodate.</i>

613
00:57:06,131 --> 00:57:09,050
<i>My sister used the war
between the new government forces</i>

614
00:57:09,134 --> 00:57:12,011
<i>and the old Shogunate army
to infiltrate Edo Castle.</i>

615
00:57:13,096 --> 00:57:16,933
<i>She had to find the Wand
before it fell into the hands of Inferni.</i>

616
00:57:18,059 --> 00:57:22,522
<i>She must have been caught
just after she found it.</i>

617
00:57:23,022 --> 00:57:28,153
<i>She released the power of the Wand
and then disappeared.</i>

618
00:57:28,236 --> 00:57:30,780
<i>That was the courtesan Chihaya?</i>

619
00:57:31,364 --> 00:57:35,243
<i>The Inferni is searching for the Wand
with the help of the Meiji government.</i>

620
00:57:36,286 --> 00:57:38,746
<i>The Wand and Brights
are deeply intertwined.</i>

621
00:57:39,456 --> 00:57:44,377
<i>By searching for elves everywhere,
they are hoping to find the Wand.</i>

622
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:47,964
<i>So there are elves in the Inferni too?
Why would they kill their own kind?</i>

623
00:57:48,047 --> 00:57:52,177
<i>I bet to keep them quiet. To stop rumors
that they are searching for the Wand.</i>

624
00:57:53,178 --> 00:57:57,140
I wonder if she hid it in there
to keep it close to her.

625
00:57:58,099 --> 00:58:00,268
She gave this to Sonya.

626
00:58:01,853 --> 00:58:04,439
So this now belongs to Sonya.

627
00:58:05,023 --> 00:58:07,108
We must give it back to her.

628
00:58:14,282 --> 00:58:19,537
Our surveillance caught Inferni members
going in and out of this estate.

629
00:58:20,288 --> 00:58:21,498
Can you smell Sonya?

630
00:58:25,793 --> 00:58:27,045
Faintly.

631
00:58:41,935 --> 00:58:46,397
If I go to the land of the elves,
can I really do whatever I want?

632
00:58:46,481 --> 00:58:48,525
All of your wishes shall be granted.

633
00:58:48,608 --> 00:58:52,946
Simply use your hidden power, and you'll
even get to meet your dead friends.

634
00:58:53,029 --> 00:58:54,364
Where are Izou and Raiden?

635
00:58:56,533 --> 00:58:58,535
They are being treated in another place.

636
00:58:59,077 --> 00:59:00,995
- Don't fret.
- I see!

637
00:59:06,417 --> 00:59:10,255
Having such skilled children as yourself
in our ranks

638
00:59:10,755 --> 00:59:14,217
is very reassuring
to all of us in the Inferni.

639
00:59:15,093 --> 00:59:20,223
I am certain
that you will revive the Dark Lord for us.

640
00:59:30,483 --> 00:59:31,818
They aren't dead?

641
00:59:40,201 --> 00:59:43,830
She doesn't have the Wand,
but she may be a Bright.

642
00:59:45,164 --> 00:59:49,127
It may be best
to bring her to our homeland.

643
00:59:52,505 --> 00:59:53,505
Let's go.

644
01:00:03,182 --> 01:00:04,851
I can smell Sonya!

645
01:00:25,913 --> 01:00:26,913
My girl!

646
01:00:30,627 --> 01:00:32,545
Who is that?

647
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:36,799
Master?

648
01:00:37,925 --> 01:00:39,218
Izou.

649
01:00:39,886 --> 01:00:41,804
I knew you were alive.

650
01:00:43,264 --> 01:00:44,349
Master Koketsu.

651
01:00:45,642 --> 01:00:46,642
Why?

652
01:00:47,060 --> 01:00:48,645
He is an Inferni officer!

653
01:00:50,688 --> 01:00:52,231
My girl!

654
01:00:59,864 --> 01:01:01,658
I won't let you have your way!

655
01:01:05,453 --> 01:01:06,704
Shield of Light?

656
01:01:14,337 --> 01:01:15,963
What will you do with that girl?

657
01:01:17,632 --> 01:01:18,632
She is...

658
01:01:19,509 --> 01:01:20,760
a Bright, isn't she?

659
01:01:30,645 --> 01:01:31,771
Izou.

660
01:01:31,854 --> 01:01:32,980
Sonya!

661
01:01:33,856 --> 01:01:34,941
Izou!

662
01:01:35,024 --> 01:01:36,024
Now go.

663
01:01:45,785 --> 01:01:48,871
There's Anna. Get the carriage!

664
01:01:48,955 --> 01:01:49,955
Right away!

665
01:01:51,457 --> 01:01:52,458
Raiden!

666
01:01:59,006 --> 01:02:00,091
Anna!

667
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:01,843
Nakazo.

668
01:02:01,926 --> 01:02:03,845
Let's go back to the hideout for now.

669
01:02:03,928 --> 01:02:04,928
Agreed.

670
01:02:27,201 --> 01:02:29,954
<i>The Inferni plans to take that girl
to their homeland.</i>

671
01:02:30,663 --> 01:02:33,833
<i>- They should be sailing from the port.
- How do we stop them?</i>

672
01:02:34,417 --> 01:02:35,918
We will chase them by ship.

673
01:02:36,544 --> 01:02:39,672
The Shield of Light
has a hideout at another port.

674
01:02:39,756 --> 01:02:41,340
Let's go after them from there.

675
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:48,014
Izou, it seemed like you knew that man.

676
01:02:50,308 --> 01:02:51,308
He used to be...

677
01:02:52,727 --> 01:02:54,020
my mentor.

678
01:02:55,438 --> 01:02:57,648
Is he the man you told me about
at the lodge?

679
01:03:03,029 --> 01:03:05,198
I would have been willing
to give up my life

680
01:03:06,866 --> 01:03:09,202
for Master Koketsu.

681
01:03:13,206 --> 01:03:17,877
And I did take a lot of risks for him.

682
01:03:22,882 --> 01:03:26,177
I was proud to be that way.

683
01:03:32,934 --> 01:03:34,268
But I was wrong.

684
01:03:39,524 --> 01:03:40,942
In the end, I realized that

685
01:03:42,276 --> 01:03:44,153
I was just a pawn for him.

686
01:03:50,827 --> 01:03:53,704
Who we should really be

687
01:03:53,788 --> 01:03:57,041
changes quite easily
depending on the circumstances.

688
01:03:57,124 --> 01:03:58,876
Some things do not change.

689
01:04:00,795 --> 01:04:02,338
I have

690
01:04:03,047 --> 01:04:07,510
the flower that the elf kid gave me
still blooming right in here.

691
01:04:08,928 --> 01:04:12,265
You will keep the promise
you made to Sonya, right?

692
01:04:14,892 --> 01:04:17,895
Isn't staying loyal to one's lord
until the end

693
01:04:17,979 --> 01:04:19,438
part of the samurai doctrine?

694
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:29,866
I'm no samurai.

695
01:04:32,702 --> 01:04:34,036
I am Sonya's

696
01:04:35,621 --> 01:04:37,081
bodyguard!

697
01:04:42,086 --> 01:04:44,130
She has returned!

698
01:04:44,213 --> 01:04:46,299
Hurry up and prepare to sail!

699
01:04:46,382 --> 01:04:47,382
Yes, sir!

700
01:05:21,459 --> 01:05:23,961
Hey! Open up!

701
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:28,215
Open this door!

702
01:06:00,414 --> 01:06:02,375
Turn starboard!

703
01:06:03,167 --> 01:06:04,251
Don't flinch!

704
01:06:20,434 --> 01:06:21,434
Let's do this.

705
01:06:43,082 --> 01:06:44,291
Boss...

706
01:06:44,375 --> 01:06:46,419
How dare you!

707
01:06:46,502 --> 01:06:49,839
Is this how you replay me
for taking you in?

708
01:06:52,383 --> 01:06:53,383
Find Sonya!

709
01:07:19,326 --> 01:07:20,953
Die!

710
01:07:29,003 --> 01:07:31,047
Time to meet your maker!

711
01:07:56,113 --> 01:07:57,198
Sonya!

712
01:07:57,865 --> 01:07:58,865
Sonya!

713
01:08:00,201 --> 01:08:03,370
Save me, Izou!

714
01:08:03,454 --> 01:08:04,705
Izou!

715
01:08:05,581 --> 01:08:07,458
- Izou!
- Sonya.

716
01:08:07,541 --> 01:08:08,542
Izou.

717
01:08:11,587 --> 01:08:13,047
- Away from the door.
- Okay!

718
01:08:17,093 --> 01:08:18,094
Izou.

719
01:08:20,054 --> 01:08:21,054
Are you all right?

720
01:08:21,514 --> 01:08:22,515
Yes, thanks...

721
01:08:43,786 --> 01:08:44,786
Sonya!

722
01:08:51,961 --> 01:08:53,129
Izou!

723
01:08:59,260 --> 01:09:00,261
Izou...

724
01:09:02,138 --> 01:09:05,432
You have lost sight
of the path you should walk.

725
01:09:08,227 --> 01:09:09,979
Obey me again.

726
01:09:12,606 --> 01:09:15,276
Pawns must live as pawns.

727
01:09:16,610 --> 01:09:19,864
I'll take back Sonya.

728
01:09:19,947 --> 01:09:21,866
Why are you so frantic

729
01:09:23,159 --> 01:09:25,536
over a mere elf girl?

730
01:09:26,745 --> 01:09:28,497
Because I made a promise!

731
01:09:28,581 --> 01:09:29,957
A promise?

732
01:09:35,421 --> 01:09:36,422
I will

733
01:09:37,590 --> 01:09:39,466
keep my promise to Sonya!

734
01:10:13,459 --> 01:10:15,044
It was my mistake back then

735
01:10:15,669 --> 01:10:18,923
to not make sure you were dead.

736
01:10:19,006 --> 01:10:20,049
But...

737
01:10:22,927 --> 01:10:25,721
I can correct that error now.

738
01:10:42,696 --> 01:10:43,948
Izou!

739
01:10:50,329 --> 01:10:52,289
Izou!

740
01:10:54,333 --> 01:10:55,626
Izou!

741
01:10:56,794 --> 01:10:59,088
Izou!

742
01:11:30,494 --> 01:11:31,578
Izou.

743
01:11:33,289 --> 01:11:34,415
Sonya...

744
01:11:41,797 --> 01:11:43,090
The Wand!

745
01:11:53,017 --> 01:11:55,853
That girl. She's a Bright.

746
01:11:56,854 --> 01:11:58,814
Where did you hide that?

747
01:11:59,565 --> 01:12:03,527
Hand that over to me.

748
01:12:03,610 --> 01:12:05,863
No way! This belongs to Chihaya!

749
01:12:05,946 --> 01:12:06,946
Do it now.

750
01:12:10,451 --> 01:12:11,910
You're not getting it.

751
01:12:12,619 --> 01:12:14,038
Trust yourself!

752
01:12:15,873 --> 01:12:16,915
Chihaya?

753
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:26,008
Give it to me.

754
01:12:27,843 --> 01:12:28,843
Give it.

755
01:12:32,848 --> 01:12:33,848
Give it now.

756
01:12:34,683 --> 01:12:37,269
Give it to me!

757
01:12:48,030 --> 01:12:50,366
No!

758
01:12:50,449 --> 01:12:51,700
Vykwarus!

759
01:13:06,965 --> 01:13:09,343
Having no place of your own

760
01:13:09,426 --> 01:13:12,971
means that you can go
anywhere you want to.

761
01:13:14,973 --> 01:13:17,351
See? Anywhere.

762
01:13:31,782 --> 01:13:34,451
A FEW DAYS LATER

763
01:13:36,203 --> 01:13:38,831
No! I don't want to!

764
01:13:38,914 --> 01:13:41,500
I'm scared of water! I hate ships!

765
01:13:42,167 --> 01:13:46,922
By seeing the world, you'll be making
the High Courtesan's wish come true.

766
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:50,717
Did you hear him? He's right.

767
01:13:55,347 --> 01:13:56,347
Fine.

768
01:13:59,351 --> 01:14:01,603
Don't treat me like a child!

769
01:14:01,687 --> 01:14:04,565
I apologize, my lady.

770
01:14:15,159 --> 01:14:17,995
Anna, please take good care of Sonya.

771
01:14:18,620 --> 01:14:19,620
Yes.

772
01:14:33,260 --> 01:14:34,260
I promise...

773
01:14:35,220 --> 01:14:37,931
that I will come back!

774
01:14:45,522 --> 01:14:47,399
We could not find any Wand.

775
01:14:49,610 --> 01:14:52,696
We will have to bring together this land

776
01:14:53,322 --> 01:14:55,574
with our own powers.

777
01:15:13,008 --> 01:15:14,092
What the...

778
01:15:22,100 --> 01:15:23,100
Hey!

779
01:15:24,937 --> 01:15:26,063
Are you sure about this?

780
01:15:28,482 --> 01:15:31,610
Humans will take care of things
with their own abilities.

781
01:15:32,569 --> 01:15:35,447
Isn't that the case in the world of orcs?

782
01:15:44,206 --> 01:15:47,292
That's also how we do it in our world.

783
01:16:04,434 --> 01:16:08,605
<i>Light gives birth to darkness
as strong as itself.</i>

784
01:16:09,898 --> 01:16:13,735
<i>They both have a purpose
and they both have a meaning.</i>

785
01:16:15,946 --> 01:16:19,741
<i>Everyone emits their light
and carries darkness.</i>

786
01:16:20,701 --> 01:16:24,871
<i>Not being ashamed in front of light
and not being afraid of darkness.</i>

787
01:16:24,955 --> 01:16:27,291
<i>That is the way I live.</i>

788
01:16:28,917 --> 01:16:32,713
<i>I wonder where the light will go
in the end.</i>

789
01:16:32,796 --> 01:16:34,631
<i>What will it shine on?</i>

790
01:16:35,257 --> 01:16:38,010
<i>It's something that no one knows.</i>

791
01:16:39,761 --> 01:16:43,515
<i>Sooner or later,
someone will speak of it again.</i>
